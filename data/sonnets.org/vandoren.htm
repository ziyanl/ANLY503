<a name=010></a><h2>He Loves Me</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>That God should love me is more wonderful
<dt>Than that I so imperfectly love him.
<dt>My reason is mortality, and dim
<dt>Senses; his--oh, insupportable--
<dt>Is that he sees me. Even when I pull
<dt>Dark thoughts about my head, each vein and limb
<dt>Delights him, though remembrance in him, grim
<dt>With my worst crimes, should prove me horrible.
<p>
<dt>And he has terrors that he can release.
<dt>But when he looks he loves me; which is why
<dt>I wonder; and my wonder must increase
<dt>Till more of it shall slay me. Yet I live,
<dt>I live; and he has never ceased to give
<dt>This glance at me that sweetens the whole sky.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>After Long Drought</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>After long drought, commotion in the sky;
<dt>After dead silence, thunder. Then it comes,
<dt>The rain. It slashes leaves, and doubly drums
<dt>On tin and shingle; beats and bends awry
<dt>The flower heads; puddles dust, and with a sigh
<dt>Like love sinks into grasses, where it hums
<dt>As bees did once, among chrysanthemums
<dt>And asters when the summer thought to die.
<p>
<dt>The whole world dreamed of this, and has it now.
<dt>Nor was the waking easy. The dull root
<dt>Is jealous of its death; the sleepy brow
<dt>Smiles in its slumber; and a heart can fear
<dt>The very flood it longed for, roaring near.
<dt>The spirit best remembers being mute.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Born Brothers</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Equality is absolute or no.
<dt>Nothing between can stand. We are the sons
<dt>Of the same sire, or madness breaks and runs
<dt>Through the rude world. Ridiculous our woe
<dt>If single pity does not love it. So
<dt>Our separate fathers love us. No man shuns
<dt>His poorest child's embrace. We are the sons
<dt>Of such, or ground and sky are soon to go.
<p>
<dt>Nor do born brothers judge, as good or ill,
<dt>Their being. Each consents and is the same,
<dt>Or suddenly sweet winds turn into flame
<dt>And floods are on us--fire, earth, water, air
<dt>All hideously parted, as his will
<dt>Withdraws, no longer fatherly and there.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>The Deepest Dream</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The deepest dream is of mad governors,
<dt>Down, down we feel it, till the very crust
<dt>Of the world cracks, and where there was no dust,
<dt>Atoms of ruin rise.  Confusion stirs,
<dt>And fear; and all our thoughts--dark scavengers--
<dt>Feed on the center's refuse. Hope is thrust
<dt>Like wind away, and love sinks into lust
<dt>For merest safety, meanest of levelers.
<p>
<dt>And then we wake. Or do we? Sleep endures
<dt>More than the morning can, when shadows lie
<dt>Sharper than mountains, and the cleft is real
<dt>Between us and our kings. What sun assures
<dt>Our courage, and what evening by and by
<dt>Descends to rest us, and perhaps to heal?
