As with many poets represented here, Wilde's best work was not in the sonnet form. For some sonnets <i>about</i> Wilde, see <a href="johnson.htm">Lionel Johnson</a> and <a href="douglas.htm">Sir Alfred Douglas</a>.

<p>
<dt>To drift with every passion till my soul
<dt>Is a stringed lute on which all winds can play
<dt>Is it for this that I have given away
<dt>Mine ancient wisdom, and austere control?
<dt>Methinks my life is a twice-written scroll
<dt>Scrawled over on some boyish holiday
<dt>With idle songs for pipe and virelay,
<dt>Which do but mar the secret of the whole.
<dt>Surely there was a time I might have trod
<dt>The sunlit heights, and from life's dissonance
<dt>Struck one clear chord to reach the ears of God:
<dt>Is that time dead?  Lo, with a little rod
<dt>I did but touch the honey of romance--
<dt>And must I lose a soul's inheritance?

<p>
<dt>Come down, O Christ, and help me! reach thy hand,
<dt>For I am drowning in a stormier sea
<dt>Than Simon on thy lake of Galilee:
<dt>The wine of life is spilt upon the sand,
<dt>My heart is as some famine-murdered land
<dt>Whence all good things have perished utterly,
<dt>And well I know my soul in Hell must lie
<dt>If I this night before God's throne should stand.
<dt>"He sleeps perchance, or rideth to the chase,
<dt>Like Baal, when his prophets howled that name
<dt>From morn to noon on Carmel's smitten height."
<dt>Nay, peace, I shall behold, before the night,
<dt>The feet of brass, the robe more white than flame,
<dt>The wounded hands, the weary human face.

<p>
<dt>Rid of the world's injustice, and his pain,
<dt>He rests at last beneath God's veil of blue;
<dt>Taken from life when life and love were new
<dt>The youngest of the martyrs here is lain,
<dt>Fair as Sebastian, and as early slain.
<dt>No cypress shades his grave, no funeral yew,
<dt>But gentle violets weeping with the dew
<dt>Weave on his bones an ever-blossoming chain.
<dt>O proudest heart that broke for misery!
<dt>O sweetest lips since those of Mitylene!
<dt>O poet-painter of our English Land!
<dt>Thy name was writ in water--it shall stand;
<dt>And tears like mine will keep thy memory green,
<dt>As Isabella did her Basil-tree.
