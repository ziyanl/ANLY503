<p>
<dt>Ilion, along whose streets in olden days
<dt>Shone that divinest form, for whose sweet face
<dt>A monarch sire, with all his kingly race,
<dt>Were too content to let their temples blaze—
<dt>Where art thou now?—no massive columns raise
<dt>Their serried shafts to heaven; we may not trace
<dt>Xanthus and Simois, nor each storied place
<dt>Round which poetic memory fondly plays.
<p></p>
<dt>But in the verse of the old man divine
<dt>Thy windy towers are built eternally;
<dt>Nor shall the ages, as they ruin by,
<dt>Print on thy bulwarks one decaying sign;
<dt>So true is beauty clothed in endless rhyme,
<dt>So false the sensual monuments of time.
<p>
<a name="020"></a><h2>To the River Wye</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>If, gentle stream, by promised sacrifice
<dt>Of kid or yearling, or by scattered flowers
<dt>Of votive roses culled from thy thick bowers,
<dt>Or golden cistus we could thee entice
<dt>To be propitious to our love, no price
<dt>Should save these errant flocks: each nook but ours
<dt>Should shed its eglantine in twinkling showers,
<dt>For tribute from thy wooded paradise.
<p></p>
<dt>But not thy flocks, nor brier-roses hung
<dt>In natural garlands down thy rocky hills,
<dt>Shall win thee to be ours; more precious far
<dt>Than summer blossoms or rich offerings are,
<dt>We bring thee sweet poetic descants, sung
<dt>To the wild music of thy tinkling rills.

<p></p>
<dt>He went into the woods a laughing boy;
<dt>Each flower was in his heart; the happy bird
<dt>Flitting across the morning sun, or heard
<dt>From wayside thicket, was to him a joy:
<dt>The water springs that in their moist employ
<dt>Leaped from the banks, with many an inward word
<dt>Spoke to his soul, and every leaf that stirred
<dt>Found notice from his quickly-glancing eye.
<p></p>
<dt>There wondrous sleep fell on him: many a year
<dt>His lids were closed: youth left him, and he woke
<dt>A careful noter of men's ways: of clear
<dt>And lofty spirit: sages, when he spoke,
<dt>Forgot their systems; and the worldly-wise
<dt>Shrunk from the gaze of truth with baffled eyes.
<p>
<a name="040"></a><h2>Winter</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Had I the wondrous magic to invest
<dt>Ideal forms in colour, I would paint
<dt>Thee, winter, first, by an ideal saint
<dt>Deep in his beads: on his bare ribs should rest
<dt>A cross of lichened boughs: and duly pressed
<dt>Each morn by horny knees, one for each bone,
<dt>There should be two round hollows in the stone,
<dt>Whither his bent limbs should be half addressed.
<p></p>
<dt>And in the entry of the holy cave
<dt>Where the same saint should sit, a laughing boy,
<dt>Naked, and all aglow with play and joy,
<dt>Should peer full slily on that father grave,
<dt>In the full blessedness of childhood's morn,
<dt>And laugh his crusty solitude to scorn.
<p>
<a name="050"></a><h2>Easter Eve</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>I saw two women weeping by the tomb
<dt>Of one new buried, in a fair green place
<dt>Bowered with shrubs;—the eve retained no trace
<dt>Of aught that day performed,—but the faint gloom
<dt>Of dying day was spread upon the sky;—
<dt>The moon was broad and bright above the wood;—
<dt>The distance sounded of a multitude,
<dt>Music and shout and mingled revelry.
<dt>At length came gleaming through the thicket shade
<dt>Helmet and casque—and a steel-armëaut;d band
<dt>Watched round the sepulchre in solemn stand;
<dt>The night-word passed, from man to man conveyed;
<dt>And I could see those women rise and go
<dt>Under the dark trees moving sad and slow.
