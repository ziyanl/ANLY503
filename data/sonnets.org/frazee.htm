<p>
<dt>Within the still, white room that gave me birth,
<dt>My body bloomed, the counterpart of two
<dt>Who bore me; but alone, across the earth,
<dt>Miles from that place, the heart they never knew
<dt>By wise moon fairies on a far high hill
<dt>Was being woven out of threads of mist;
<dt>Its fragile beauty was a thing more still
<dt>Than any lake the wind has ever kissed.
<p>
<dt>And I have borne it secretly within,
<dt>A shy soft wonder sleeping at my breast;
<dt>And such has been dissemblance I could win
<dt>That even those who bore me have not guessed,
<dt>When misty moonlight blows from tree to tree,
<dt>How near they are at last to finding me.
