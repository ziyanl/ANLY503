<a name=100></a><h2>"Although we do not all the good we love"</h2>
<p>
<dt>Although we do not all the good we love,
<dt>But still, in love, desire to do the same;
<dt>Nor leave the sins we hate, but hating move
<dt>Our soul and body's powers their powers to tame;
<dt>The good we do God takes as done aright,
<dt>That we desire to do he takes as done;
<dt>The sin we shun he will with grace requite,
<dt>And not impute the sin we seek to shun.
<dt>But good desires produce no worser deeds,
<dt>For God doth both together lightly give,
<dt>Because he knows a righteous man must needs
<dt>By faith, that works by love, forever live.
<dt>Then to do nought but only in desire
<dt>Is love that burns, but burns like painted fire.
</P>


<a name=200></a><h2>"Some blaze the precious beauties of their loves"</h2>
<P>
<dt>Some blaze the precious beauties of their loves
<dt>By precious stones, and other some by flowers,
<dt>Some by the planets and celestial powers,
<dt>Or by what else their fancy best approves;
<dt>Yet I by none of these will blazon mine,
<dt>But only say her self herself is like,
<dt>For those similitudes I much mislike
<dt>That are much used, though they be divine.
<dt>In saying she is like herself, I say
<dt>She hath no like, for she is past compare.
<dt>Then who aright commends this creature rare
<dt>Must say, "She is"; and there of force must stay,
<dt>Because by words she cannot be expressed;
<dt>So say, "She is," and wond'ring owe the rest.
</P>
