<dt>A plaintive sonnet flowed from Milton's pen
<dt>When time had stolen his three and twentieth year:
<dt>Say, shall not I, then, shed one tuneful tear,
<dt>Robbed by the thief of three-score years and ten?
<dt>No! for the foes of all life-lengthened men,
<dt>Trouble and toil, approach not yet too near;
<dt>Reason, meanwhile, and health, and memory dear
<dt>Hold unimpaired their weak yet wonted reign.
<p>
<dt>Still round my sheltered lawn I pleased can stray;
<dt>Still trace my sylvan blessings to their spring:
<dt>Being of beings! yes, that silent lay
<dt>Which musing gratitude delights to sing,
<dt>Still to thy sapphire throne shall faith convey,
<dt>And hope, the cherub of unwearied wing.
