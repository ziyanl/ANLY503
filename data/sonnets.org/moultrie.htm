<p>
<dt>A gibbering ape that leads an elephant;
<dt>A dwarf deformed, the presence heralding
<dt>Of potent wizard, or the Elfin King;
<dt>Caliban, deigning sage advice to grant
<dt>To mighty Prosper in some hour of want;
<dt>Sweet bully Bottom, while the fairies sing,
<dt>Braying applause to their rich carolling,
<dt>But feebly typify thy flippant cant,
<dt>Stupid defamer, who for many a year
<dt>With earth's profoundest teacher wast at school
<dt>And, notwithstanding, does at last appear
<dt>A brainless, heartless, faithless, hopeless fool.
<dt>Come, take thy cap and bells, and throne thee here,
<dt>Conspicuous on the dunce's loftiest stool.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The hand of Death lay heavy on her eyes,--
<dt>For weeks and weeks her vision had not borne
<dt>To meet the tenderest light of eve or morn,
<dt>To see the crescent moonbeam set or rise,
<dt>Or palest twilight creep across the skies:
<dt>She lay in darkness, seemingly forlorn,
<dt>With sharp and ceaseless anguish rack'd and torn,
<dt>Yet calm with that one peace which never dies.
<dt>Closed was, for her, the gate of visual sense,
<dt>This world and all its beauty lost in night;
<dt>But the pure soul was all ablaze with light,
<dt>And through that gloom she saw, with gaze intense,
<dt>Celestial glories, hid from fleshly sight,
<dt>And heard angelic voices call her hence.
