<p>
<dt>When the great sun sets the glad East aflame,
<dt>The lingering stars are swiftly put to flight;
<dt>For Day, triumphant, overthrows the night,
<dt>And mocks the lights that twinkled till he came.
<dt>The waning moon retires in sudden shame;
<dt>And all the air, from roseate height to height,
<dt>Quivers with wings of birds, that take the light
<dt>To jubilant music of one tender name.
<p>
<dt>So Thou hast risen,--Thou who art my day;
<dt>And every lesser light has ceased to shine.
<dt>Pale stars, confronted by this dawn of thine,
<dt>Like night and gloom and grief have passed away;
<dt>And yet my bliss I fear to call it mine,
<dt>Lest fresh foes lurk with unforeseen dismay.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>One Dread</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>No depth, dear Love, for thee is too profound;
<dt>There is no farthest height thou mayst not dare,
<dt>Nor shall thy wings fail in the upper air:
<dt>In funeral robe and wreath my past lies bound;
<dt>No old-time voice assails me with its sound
<dt>When thine I hear; no former joy seems fair;
<dt>And now one only thing could bring despair,
<dt>One grief like compassing seas my life surround,
<dt>One only terror in my way be met,
<dt>One great eclipse change my glad day to night,
<dt>One phantom only turn from red to white
<dt>The lips whereon thy lips have once been set:
<dt>Thou knowest well, dear Love, what that must be,--
<dt>The dread of some dark day unshared by thee.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Afar</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Where Thou art not no day holds light for me,
<dt>The brightest noontide turns to midnight deep;
<dt>There no bird sings, but awesome shadows creep,--
<dt>Persistent ghosts that hold my memory,
<dt>And walk where Joy and Hope once walked with thee,
<dt>And in thy place their lonesome vigil keep,--
<dt>Sad shades that haunt the inmost ways of sleep,
<dt>No kindly morning ever bids them flee.
<p>
<dt>Those tireless footsteps, will they never cease?
<dt>Like crownless queens they tread their ancient ways,--
<dt>Pale phantoms of old dreams and vanished days,--
<dt>And mock my poor endeavors after peace.
<dt>Too long this Arctic night, too keen its cold;
<dt>Come back, strong sun, and warm me as of old!
<p>
<h2>Last Year</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name=040></a><h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>You thought, O Love, you loved me then, I know;
<dt>For that I bless you, now when Love is cold,
<dt>Remembering how warm the tale you told,
<dt>While winds of autumn fitfully did blow,
<dt>And, by the sea's perpetual ebb and flow,
<dt>We wandered on together to behold
<dt>Noon's radiant splendor, or the sunset's gold,
<dt>Or beauty of still nights where moons hung low.
<p>
<dt>Your voice grew tender when you called my name;
<dt>I heard that voice to-day,--was it the same?--
<dt>The old-time music trembles in it yet.
<dt>Your touch thrilled through me like a sudden flame
<dt>And then Love's sweet and subtle madness came,
<dt>And glad lips clung that now to kiss forget.
<a name=045></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>You surely must remember, though to-day
<dt>There is no spell to charm you in the past.
<dt>So dear the dream was that it could not last:
<dt>Too soon our pleasant skies were changed to gray;
<dt>The sun turned from our barren land away,
<dt>And all the leaves swept by us on the blast,
<dt>And all our hopes to that wild wind were cast--
<dt>For dead Love's soul there is no place to pray.
<p>
<dt>But still the old time lingers in our thought;
<dt>In our regretful dreams the old suns rise,
<dt>And from their shining, memory hath caught
<dt>Some lingering glory of that glad surprise
<dt>When Love rose on us like the sun, and brought
<dt>Our hearts their morning under last year's skies.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>First Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Time was you heard the music of a sigh,
<dt>And Love awoke; and with it Song was born,--
<dt>Song glad as young birds carol in the morn,
<dt>And tender as the blue and brooding sky,
<dt>When all the earth feels Spring's warm witchery,
<dt>And with fresh flowers her bosom doth adorn;
<dt>And lovers love, and cannot love forlorn,
<dt>Since Love is of the gods, and may not die.
<p>
<dt>In after years may come some wildering light,--
<dt>Some sweet delusion, followed for a space,--
<dt>Such fitful fire-flies flash athwart the night,
<dt>But fade before the shining of that face
<dt>Which shines upon you still in Death's despite,
<dt>Whose steadfast beauty lights till death your days.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Love's Forgiveness</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I do forgive you for the pain I bear,
<dt>Though bitter pain is mingled with my bliss;
<dt>For still I think, while thrilling to your kiss,
<dt>"He found that other woman much more fair."
<dt>I read your words, and see, immortal there,
<dt>Another love--how warm it was to this!
<dt>And know that from my face you still must miss
<dt>The beauty that another used to wear.
<p>
<dt>Yet I forgive you, Dear, and bow my head
<dt>To Destiny, my master and your own,--
<dt>He sets the way wherein my feet must tread;
<dt>And if he give me nothing quite mine own,--
<dt>I know some day my heart, so sore bested,
<dt>Will rest most quietly, and turn to stone.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>In Time to Come</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The time will come full soon! I shall be gone,
<dt>And you sit silent in the silent place,
<dt>With the sad autumn sunlight on your face.
<dt>Remembering the loves that were your own,
<dt>Haunted perchance by some familiar tone,
<dt>You will be weary then for the dead days,
<dt>And mindful of their sweet and bitter ways,
<dt>Though passion into memory shall have grown.
<p>
<dt>Then will I with your other ghosts draw nigh,
<dt>And whisper, as I pass, some former word,--
<dt>Some old endearment known in days gone by,
<dt>Some tenderness that once your pulses stirred:--
<dt>Which was it spoke to you, the wind or I?
<dt>I think you, musing, scarcely will have heard.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>A Summer's Growth</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Fair was the flower which proffers now its fruit;
<dt>The bud began to swell 'neath Spring's soft dew,
<dt>And tenderly the winds of summer blew
<dt>To foster it; and great strong suns were mute,
<dt>As through its veins warm life began to shoot,
<dt>And it put on each day some beauty new.
<dt>And all the fairer, as I think, it grew,
<dt>Because the streams were tears about its root.
<p>
<dt>But now our fruit hangs well within our reach,
<dt>And this indeed is time for gathering.
<dt>It hath the bloom of summer-tinted peach,
<dt>Each charm it hath that any man could sing;
<dt>Yet we, who taste it, whisper each to each,
<dt>"Not sweet, but very bitter, is this thing!"
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>My Birthday</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Chide not because I doubt who would believe!
<dt>Has not my life been like that April day
<dt>Whose dawn awoke us with such proud display
<dt>Of mocking glory, kindled to deceive,
<dt>While in the distance low winds seemed to grieve,--
<dt>Winds sad with prophecy,--then skies grew gray,
<dt>And all the morning splendor passed away,
<dt>And dark with rain came on the gusty eve?
<p>
<dt>That was my birthday, symbol of my birth,--
<dt>Capricious April's heir, the sport of Fate,
<dt>Doomed to be better friends with Grief than Mirth,
<dt>To know no love that did not come too late,--
<dt>My only hope, sore spent with life's long pain,
<dt>In some glad morning to be born again. 
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Helen's Cup</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Give me the potent draught that Helen poured
<dt>To lull Telemachus! Make me forget
<dt>All present peril, all old sins, and let
<dt>Me dream, in peace. Long threat'ning, Fate's sharp sword
<dt>Before my eyes has hung--about me roared
<dt>The battle's clamor. Sore I am beset--
<dt>New fears and ancient pains together met
<dt>Assail me, who for peace have long implored:
<p>
<dt>Give me at last to drink, and let them flee,
<dt>The baffled ghosts that watch me sullenly,
<dt>To those waste fields that waiting shadows keep;
<dt>And down some waveless tide, in quiet deep
<dt>As set of day upon a quiet sea,
<dt>Oh, let me drift and dream, and fall on sleep!
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>Silent Sorrow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If she unclosed her lips and made her moan
<dt>She would not be so weary with her woe--
<dt>A burden shared is lightened: even so
<dt>The weight is heavier that we bear alone,
<dt>And anguish, pent within, turns hearts to stone.
<dt>The fellowship of sorrow to forego--
<dt>To suffer and be silent--is to know
<dt>The blackest blossom from the black root grown.
<p>
<dt>And yet great joys and greatest woes are dumb:
<dt>Small is the sum that reckoning can compute--
<dt>The shallows babble, but the depths are mute--
<dt>The great mid-sea our measure may not plumb:
<dt>King Love, King Pain, King Death, in silence come;
<dt>And, meeting them, we silently salute.
<p>
<a name=120></a><h2>A Cry</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O wanderer in unknown lands, what cheer?
<dt>How dost thou fare on thy mysterious way?
<dt>What strange light breaks upon thy distant day,
<dt>Yet leaves me lonely in the darkness here?
<dt>Oh, bide no longer in that far-off sphere:
<dt>Though all Heaven's cohorts should thy footsteps stay,
<dt>Break through their splendid, militant array,
<dt>And answer to my call, O dead and dear!
<p>
<dt>I shall not fear thee, howsoe'er thou come;
<dt>Thy coldness will not chill, though Death is cold;
<dt>A touch, and I shall know thee,--or a breath;
<dt>Speak the old, well-known language, or be dumb;
<dt>Only come back! Be near me as of old;
<dt>So thou and I shall triumph over Death!
<p>
<a name=130></a><h2>Love's Empty House</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O thou long-silent, solitary house,
<dt>Where Love once came and went with joyous cries,
<dt>Or lingered long, sighing as Summer sighs
<dt>When Autumn's breath begins her fear to rouse
<dt>With fierce caress that shall make bare her boughs
<dt>Her tender boughs, and all her beauty's prize
<dt>Deliver, faded, to the winds that rise
<dt>And rend her crown from her dishonored brows!--
<p>
<dt>O solitary house! thine open door
<dt>Again shall welcome sweet Love's wingèd tread
<dt>His eyes shall light thee, as they lit of yore
<dt>In days when Love and Joy were newly wed;
<dt>He shall return with myrtle round his head,
<dt>And fill thy halls with music as before.
<p>
<a name=140></a><h2>After Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3><i>And very sweet it is</i></h3>
<h3><i>To know he is still warm though I am cold.</i></h3>
<h4>--Christina Rossetti</h4>
<p>
<dt>I would not have thee warm when I am cold;
<dt>But both together--'neath some sylvan mound,
<dt>Amid the pleasant secrets under ground,
<dt>Where green things flourish in the embracing mould,
<dt>And jealous seeds the souls of blossoms hold--
<dt>In some sweet fellowship of silence bound,
<dt>Deeper than life, more exquisite than sound,
<dt>Rest tranquilly while Love's new tales are told.
<p>
<dt>We will not grudge the waking world its bliss,
<dt>Its joy of speech, its gladness of surprise,
<dt>When lovers clasp each others hands and kiss
<dt>And earth puts on new glory to their eyes:
<dt>We, lying there with Death's deep knowledge wise,
<dt>Shall know that we have found Life's best in this.
<p>
<a name=150></a><h2>Voices on the Wind</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Far out at sea I hear the wind complain,--
<dt>With the old plaint that vexed my childish ear,
<dt>And seemed the cry of spirits drawing near
<dt>To sob their incommunicable pain.
<dt>Whence did they come, and whither go again?
<dt>My very heart stood still with sudden fear
<dt>When the forlorn approach I used to hear
<dt>Of all the shuddering, melancholy train.
<p>
<dt>And lo, in this night's vigil far at sea,
<dt>The same long cry!--Are they unpardoned yet?
<dt>Does the old pain still goad them till they come,
<dt>Unsheltered souls, to sob once more to me
<dt>Of some dead wrong they never can forget
<dt>Till there is no more sea, and winds are dumb?
<p>
<a name=160></a><h2>The Cup of Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>For a picture by Elihu Vedder.</h3>
<p>
<dt>She bends her beauteous head to taste thy draught,
<dt>O thou stern Angel of the Darker Cup!
<dt>With thee to-night in the dim shades to sup,
<dt>Where all they be who from that cup have quaffed.
<dt>She had been clad with loveliness, and laughed
<dt>At Life's strong enemies who lie in wait;
<dt>Had kept with golden youth her queenly state,
<dt>All unafraid of Sorrow's threat'ning shaft.
<p>
<dt>Then human Grief found out her human heart,
<dt>And she was fain to go where pain is dumb;
<dt>So Thou wert welcome, Angel dread to see,
<dt>And she fares onward with thee, willingly,
<dt>To dwell where no man loves, no lovers part,--
<dt>Thus Grief that is, makes welcome Death to come.
<p>
<a name=170></a><h2>To a Modern Poet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3>With a copy of "Shakespeare's Sonnets."</h3>
<p>
<dt>Take thou these words thine elder brother writ,--
<dt>Thou, to whom Song is as thy native speech!
<dt>Across the swift-flown centuries thou canst reach
<dt>To him, thy kinsman, reverent hands and sit--
<dt>While shadows of the Past about ye flit--
<dt>With him, "in sessions of sweet, silent thought,"
<dt>And share with him those halcyon days that brought
<dt>Music's sweet charm, and sparkle keen of wit.
<p>
<dt>So shalt thou learn the secret of his song,--
<dt>Those minor chords; since Life is as the leaf,
<dt>And gladdest love and brightest day are brief;
<dt>Those clear, bold notes that told his soul was strong,
<dt>Brave to endure, and swift to smite the wrong,
<dt>Until Death healed thine elder brother's grief.
<p>
<a name=180></a><h2>The Last Good-by</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How shall we know it is the last good-by?
<dt>The skies will not be darkened in that hour,
<dt>No sudden blight will fall on leaf or flower,
<dt>No single bird will hush its careless cry,
<dt>And you will hold my hands, and smile or sigh
<dt>Just as before. Perchance the sudden tears
<dt>In your dear eyes will answer to my fears;
<dt>But there will come no voice of prophecy, --
<p>
<dt>No voice to whisper, "Now, and not again,
<dt>Space for last words, last kisses, and last prayer
<dt>For all the wild, unmitigated pain
<dt>Of those who, parting, clasp hands with despair," 
<dt>"Who knows?" we say, but doubt and fear remain.
<dt>Would any choose to part thus unaware?
<p>
<a name=190></a><h2>Love Is Dead</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I heard one cry out strongly, "Love is dead!"
<dt>And then we went and looked upon his face,
<dt>Turned into marble by Death's final grace:
<dt>His silent lips, that once so vainly pled,
<dt>Smile now, as men smile being newly wed;
<dt>Since some strange joy Life's sorrows did efface
<dt>When Death's arms clasped him in supreme embrace,
<dt>All his long pain of living comforted.
<p>
<dt>And you would wake him? Dare you him recall
<dt>From Death's enamouring to Life's stern pain;
<dt>Make him again the old grief's hopeless thrall;
<dt>Bind him once more with the old clanking chain,
<dt>And goad him on his weary way again?--
<dt>Nay! let him rest with Death, the lord of all.
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>Hic Jacet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>So Love is dead that has been quick so long!
<dt>Close, then, his eyes, and bear him to his rest,
<dt>With eglantine and myrtle on his breast,
<dt>And leave him there, their pleasant scents among;
<dt>And chant a sweet and melancholy song
<dt>About the charms whereof he was possessed,
<dt>And how of all things he was loveliest,
<dt>And to compare with aught were him to wrong.
<p>
<dt>Leave him beneath the still and solemn stars,
<dt>That gather and look down from their far place
<dt>With their long calm our brief woes to deride,
<dt>Until the Sun the Morning's gate unbars
<dt>And mocks, in turn, our sorrows with his face;--
<dt>And yet, had Love been Love, he had not died.
<p>
<a name=210></a><h2>Left Behind</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Wilt thou forget me in that other sphere,--
<dt>Thou who hast shared my life so long in this,--
<dt>And straight grown dizzy with that greater bliss,
<dt>Fronting heaven's splendor strong and full and clear,
<dt>No longer hold the old embraces dear
<dt>When some sweet seraph crowns thee with her kiss?
<dt>Nay, surely from that rapture thou wouldst miss
<dt>Some slight, small thing that thou hast cared for here.
<p>
<dt>I do not dream that from those ultimate heights
<dt>Thou wilt come back to seek me where I bide;
<dt>But if I follow, patient of thy slights,
<dt>And if I stand there, waiting by thy side,
<dt>Surely thy heart with some old thrill will stir,
<dt>And turn thy face toward me, even from her.
<p>
<a name=220></a><h2>Future Forgiveness</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How long wilt thou be silent, lying there?
<dt>I grieved thee once, and now my heart makes moan,
<dt>Cries, and thou wilt not answer, turned to stone,
<dt>And pitiless as stone to my despair:
<dt>My tears fall on thee, and thou dost not care:
<dt>Oh! art thou cruel now who wast so kind;
<dt>Or only to my sorrow deaf and blind--
<dt>Gone on beyond the hearing of my prayer?
<p>
<dt>Shall it not be that in thy brighter life
<dt>I find thee, move thee to some pitying thrill,
<dt>And win thee by my pleading to forgive?
<dt>Thou couldst forget past folly and past strife,
<dt>Seeing, in that new sphere, I love thee still;
<dt>And thou--didst thou not love thou wouldst not live.
<p>
<a name=230></a><h2>In Pace</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I am dead, with mockery of praise
<dt>Thou shalt not vex the stillness of my sleep:
<dt>Leave me to long tranquillity and deep,
<dt>Who, through such weary nights and lonesome days,
<dt>Such hopeless stretch of uncompanioned ways,
<dt>Have come at length my quiet rest to keep
<dt>Where nettles thrive, and careless brambles creep,
<dt>And things that love the dark their dull brood raise.
<p>
<dt>After my restless years I would have rest,--
<dt>Long rest after so many restless years,--
<dt>Unmocked by hope, set free from haunting fears;
<dt>Since some old pain might waken at thy tread,
<dt>Do thou for once in this my heart's behest,
<dt>Come thou not nigh when I am lying dead.
<p>
<a name=240></a><h2>A Woman's Knowledge</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A rose to smell a moment, then to leave,
<dt>Chance strain of song you smile at as you pass,
<dt>Bubble that breaks before you lip the glass,
<dt>Chain frail as the frail thread that spiders weave;
<dt>Oh, do not think that I myself deceive!
<dt>Thus, and not otherwise, to you am I,--
<dt>A moment's pleasure as you pass me by,
<dt>Powerless, at best, to make you joy or grieve.
<p>
<dt>And you, to me, my sun-god and my sun,
<dt>Who warmed my heart to life with careless ray!
<dt>Forever will that burning memory stay
<dt>And warm me in the grave when life is done:--
<dt>What farther grace has any woman won?
<dt>Since your chance gift you cannot take away.
