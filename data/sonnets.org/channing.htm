<h2>The Day   Is Done</h2>
<p>
<dt>The day has past, I never may return;
<dt>Twelve circling years have run since first I came
<dt>And kindled the pure truth of friendship's flame;
<dt> Alone remain these ashes in the urn,—
<dt>Vainly for light the taper may I turn,—
<dt>Thy hand is closed, as for these years, the same,
<dt>And for the substance nought is but the name;
<dt>No more hope, no more a ray to burn.
<dt>       &nbsp;
<dt>But once more, in the pauses of thy joy,
<dt>Remember him who sought thee in his youth,
<dt>And, with the old reliance of the boy,
<dt>Asked for thy treasures in the guise of truth.
<dt>The air is thick with sighs,—the shaded sun
<dt>Shows on the hillside that the day is done.
<dt>
<h2>Hearts of Eternity</h2>       
<dt> Hearts of eternity, hearts of the deep!
<dt>Proclaim from land to sea your mighty fate;
<dt>How that for you no living comes too late,
<dt> How ye cannot in Theban labyrinth creep,
<dt>How ye great harvests from small surface reap.
<dt> Shout, excellent band, in grand primeval strain,
<dt>Like midnight winds that foam along the main,
<dt>And do all things rather than pause to weep!
<dt>       &nbsp;
<dt> A human heart knows nought of littleness,
<dt>Suspects no man, compares with no one's ways,
<dt>Hath in one hour most glorious length of days,
<dt>  A recompense, a joy, a loveliness;
<dt> Like eaglet keen, shoots into azure far,
<dt>And always dwelling nigh is the remotest star.</dt>
