<a name=010></a><h2>The Coming of the Wind</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>An hour agone, and prostrate Nature lay
<dt>Like some sore-smitten creature nigh to death,
<dt>With feverish parched lips, with labouring breath,
<dt>And languid eyeballs darkening to the day.
<dt>A burning noontide ruled with merciless sway
<dt>Earth, wave, and air; the ghastly-stretching heath,
<dt>The sullen trees, the fainting flowers beneath,
<dt>Drooped hopeless, shrivelling in the torrid ray;--
<dt>When, like a sudden, cheerful trumpet blown
<dt>Far off by rescuing spirits, rose the wind
<dt>Urging great hosts of clouds; the thunder's tone
<dt>Breaks into wrath; the rainy cataracts fall.
<dt>But, pausing, lo, behold Creation shrined
<dt>In a new birth,--God's covenant clasping all!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>October</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The passionate summer's dead! the sky's aglow
<dt>With roseate flushes of matured desire,
<dt>The winds at eve are musical and low,
<dt>As sweeping chords of a lamenting lyre,
<dt>Far up among the pillared clouds of fire,
<dt>Whose pomp of strange procession upward rolls,
<dt>With gorgeous blazonry of pictured scrolls,
<dt>To celebrate the summer's past renown;
<dt>Ah, me! how regally the heavens look down
<dt>O'ershadowing beautiful autumnal woods
<dt>And harvest fields with hoarded increase brown
<dt>And deep-toned majesty of golden floods
<dt>That raise their solemn dirges to the sky,
<dt>To swell the purple pomp that floateth by.

<p>
<dt>Too oft the poet in elaborate verse,
<dt>Flushed with quaint images and gorgeous tropes,
<dt>Casteth a doubtful light, which is not hope's,
<dt>On the dark spot where Death hath sealed his curse
<dt>In monumental silence. Nature starts
<dt>Indignant from the sacrilege of words
<dt>That ring so hollow, and forlornly girds
<dt>Her great woe round her; there's no trick of Art's
<dt>But shows most ghastly by a new-made tomb.
<dt>I see no balm in Gilead; he is lost,
<dt>The beautiful soul that loved thee, thy life's bloom
<dt>Is withered by the sudden blighting frost;
<dt>O Grief! how mighty; Creeds! how vain ye are:
<dt>Earth presses closely,--Heaven is cold and far.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>The Phantom Bells</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Upveiled in yonder dim ethereal sea,
<dt>Its airy towers the work of phantom spells,
<dt>A viewless belfry tolls its wizard bells.
<dt>Pealed o'er this populous earth perpetually.
<dt>Some hear, some hear them not; but aye they be
<dt>Laden with one strange note that sinks or swells,
<dt>Now dread as doom, now gentle as farewells,
<dt>Time's dirge borne ever toward eternity.
<dt>Each hour in measured breath sobs out and dies,
<dt>While the bell tolls its requiem,--"<i>Passing, past</i>,"--
<dt>The sole sad burden of their long refrain.
<dt>Still, with those hours each pang, each pleasure flies,
<dt>Brief sweet, brief bitter,--all our days are vain,
<dt>Knolled into dread forgetfulness at last.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Life and Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I fear thee not, O Death! nay, oft I pine
<dt>To clasp thy passionless bosom to mine own,
<dt>And on thy heart sob out my latest moan,
<dt>Ere lapped and lost in thy strange sleep divine;
<dt>But much I fear lest that chill breath of thine
<dt>Should freeze all tender memories into stone,--
<dt>Lest ruthless and malign Oblivion
<dt>Quench the last spark that lingers on love's shrine:
<dt>O God! to moulder through dark, dateless years,
<dt>The while all loving ministries shall cease,
<dt>And time assuage the fondest mourner's tears!
<dt>Here lies the sting!--this, <i>this</i> it is to die!
<dt>And yet great Nature rounds all strife with peace,
<dt>And Life or Death, each rests in mystery!
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Earth Odours--After Rain</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Life-yielding fragrance of our Mother Earth!
<dt>Benignant breath exhaled from summer showers!--
<dt>All Nature dimples into smiles of flowers,
<dt>From unclosed woodland to trim garden girth:--
<dt>These perfumes softening the harsh soul of dearth
<dt>Are older than old Shinar's arrogant towers,--
<dt>And touched with visions of rain-freshened hours,
<dt>On Syrian hill-slopes ere the Patriarch's birth!
<dt>Nay! the charmed fancy plays a subtler part!--
<dt>Lo! banished Adam, his large, wondering eyes
<dt>Fixed on the trouble of the first dark cloud!
<dt>Lo! tremulous Eve,--a pace behind, how bowed,--
<dt>Not dreaming, 'midst her painful pants of heart,
<dt>What balm shall fall from yonder ominous cloud!
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>At Last</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In youth, when blood was warm and fancy high,
<dt>I mocked at death. How many a quaint conceit
<dt>I wove about his veiled head and feet,
<dt>Vaunting aloud, <i>Why need we dread to die?</i>
<dt>But now, enthralled by deep solemnity,
<dt>Death's pale phantasmal shade I darkly greet:
<dt>Ghostlike it haunts the hearth, it haunts the street,
<dt>Or drearier makes drear midnight's mystery.
<dt>Ah, soul-perplexing vision! oft I deem
<dt>That antique myth is true which pictured death
<dt>A masked and hideous form all shrank to see;
<dt>But at the last slow ebb of mortal breath,
<dt>Death, his mask melting like a nightmare dream,
<dt>Smiled,--heaven's high-priest of Immortality!
