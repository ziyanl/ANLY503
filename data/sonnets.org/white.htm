<a name=010></a><h2>To Consumption</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Gently, most gently on thy victim's head,
<dt>Consumption, lay thine hand! Let me decay
<dt>Like the expiring lamp, unseen, away,
<dt>And softly go to slumber with the dead!
<dt>And if it is true what holy men have said
<dt>That strains angelic oft foretell the day
<dt>Of death to those good men who fall thy prey,
<dt>O let the a&euml;rial music round my bed,
<dt>Dissolving slow in dying symphony,
<dt>Whisper the solemn warnings to my ear:
<dt>That I may bid my weeping friends good-bye
<dt>Ere I depart upon my journey drear;
<dt>And, smiling faintly on the painful past,
<dt>Compose my decent head and breathe my last.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Bitter Cup</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Yes, it will be over soon.--This sickly dream
<dt>Of life will vanish from my feverish brain;
<dt>And death my wearied spirit will redeem
<dt>From this wild region of unvaried pain.
<p>
<dt>Yon brook will glide as softly as before,
<dt>Yon landscape smile,--yon golden harvest grow,
<dt>Yon sprightly lark on mounting wing will soar
<dt>When Henry's name is heard no more below.
<p>
<dt>I sigh when all my youthful friends caress,
<dt>They laugh in health, and future evils brave;
<dt>Them shall a wife and smiling children bless,
<dt>While I am mouldering in my silent grave.
<p>
<dt>God of the just, Thou gavest the bitter cup;
<dt>I bow to Thy behest, and drink it up.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Dark Woodland</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As thus oppressed with many a heavy care
<dt>(Though young yet sorrowful), I turn my feet
<dt>To the dark woodland, longing much to greet
<dt>The form of peace, if chance she sojourn there;
<dt>Deep thought and dismal, verging to despair,
<dt>Fills my sad breast; and tired with this vain coil
<dt>I shrink dismayed before life's upland toil,
<dt>And as amid the leaves the evening air
<dt>Whispers still melody,
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;--I think, ere long
<dt>When I no more can hear, these woods will speak;
<dt>And then a sad smile plays upon my cheek,
<dt>And mournful fantasies upon me throng,
<dt>And I do ponder with most strange delight
<dt>On the calm slumbers of the dead man's night.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>To Misfortune</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Misfortune, I am young, my chin is bare,
<dt>And I have wondered much when men have told
<dt>How youth was free from sorrow and from care,
<dt>That thou shouldst dwell with me and leave the old.
<dt>Sure dost not like me!--Shrivelled hag of hate,
<dt>My phiz--and thanks to thee--is sadly long;
<dt>I am not either, beldame, over strong;
<dt>Nor do I wish at all to be thy mate,
<dt>For thou, sweet fury, art my utter hate.
<dt>Nay, shake not thus thy miserable pate
<dt>I am yet young, and do not like thy face;
<dt>And lest thou shouldst resume the wild-goose chase
<dt>I'll tell thee something all thy heat to assuage
<dt>Thou wilt not hit my fancy in my age.

<p>
<dt>Let the sublimer Muse, who wrapt in night
<dt>Rides on the raven pennons of the storm,
<dt>Or o'er the field with purple havock warm
<dt>Lashes her steeds and sings along the fight,--
<dt>Let her, whom more ferocious strains delight,
<dt>Disdain the plaintive sonnet's little form,
<dt>And scorn to its mild cadence to conform
<dt>The impetuous tenor of her hardy flight.
<p>
<dt>But me, far lowliest of the sylvan train
<dt>Who wake the wood-nymphs from the forest shade
<dt>With wildest song,--me much behooves the aid
<dt>Of mingled melody, to grace my strain,
<dt>And give it power to please, as soft it flows
<dt>Through the smooth murmurs of thy frequent close.
