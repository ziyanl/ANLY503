<h2>Music</h2>
<p>
<dt>Take of the maiden's and the mother's sigh,
<dt>Of childhood's dream, and hope that age doth bless,
<dt>Of roses and the south wind's tenderness,
<dt>Of fir-tree's shadow, tint of sunset sky,
<dt>Of moon on meadow where the stream runs by,
<dt>Of lover's kiss, his diffident caress,
<dt>Of blue eyes' yellow, brown eyes' darker, tress,
<dt>Of echoes from the morning bird on high,
<dt>Of passion of all pulses of the Spring,
<dt>Of prayer from every death-bed of the Fall,
<dt>Of joy and woe that sleep and waking bring,
<dt>Of tremor of each blood-beat great and small;
<dt>Now, pour into the empty soul each thing,
<dt>And let His finger touch that moveth all.

<h2>
The Skillful Listener</h2>       
<dt>The skillful listener, methinks, may hear       
<dt>The grass blades clash in suny field together,       
<dt>The roses kissing, and the lily, whether       
<dt>It laugh or sigh low in the summer's ear,       
<dt>The jewel dew-bells of the mead ring clear       
<dt>When morning's nearing in the sweet June weather;       
<dt>The flocked hours winging, feather unto feather,       
<dt>The last leaf wail at waning of the year.       
<dt>Methinks, from these we catch a passing song,       
<dt>(The best of verities, perhaps, but seem),       
<dt>Hearing, forsooth, shy Nature, on her round,       
<dt>When least she imagines it; birds, wood, and stream       
<dt>Not only, but her silences profound,       
<dt>Surprised by softer footfall of our dream.
