<p>
<dt>I read of 'Julian' and 'Count Maddalo'
<dt>Till in their spirits' presence stood my soul;
<dt>And blending with their sympathy of woe
<dt>A tempest woke my thoughts, and they gan roll,
<dt>Billow on billow, toward eternity--
<dt>And passion's cloud hung over the vast sea.
<dt>Where is the essence now that thought and spoke?
<dt>Absorbed like water, the frail vessel broke
<dt>That held it trembling from the sand awhile?
<dt>Or doth it quiver still; and, quivering, smile
<dt>At the now cleared-up mystery of creation?
<dt>Which shook it once even to its mortal seat,
<dt>Which seems the brain and heart, that burn and beat
<dt>Till life pants darkly for annihilation.

<a name=020></a><h2>The Uncharmed</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My pierc&eacute;d life was all ablood with sorrow
<dt>For, suddenly, the veil of beauty thrown
<dt>By glorifying youth over sweet to-morrow
<dt>Fell, and disclosed to me the future's frown;
<dt>Within the wrinkles of whose unread brow
<dt>There was a lurking something which till then
<dt>I dreamed not hung before the lives of men,
<dt>Ready to fall upon them as they grow
<dt>Into the longer knowledge of brief years:
<dt>Blank vacancy; and doubt; and strangled tears
<dt>That never reach the eyelids; vanishing
<dt>Of all sweet things we love; death-beds; and graves;
<dt>And shadowy wrecks, where pale hopes trembling cling,
<dt>Heart-faint, and stifled by continual waves!
