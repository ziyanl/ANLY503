<p>
<dt>In summer's dreary ear, as suns go by
<dt>Whose yellow beams are dulled with langorous motes,
<dt>The deep vibrations of the cosmic notes
<dt>Are as the voice of those that prophesy.
<dt>Her spirit kindles, and her filmy eye!
<dt>In haste the fluttering robe, whose glory floats
<dt>In pictured folds, her eager soul devotes--
<dt>Lo, she with her winged harper sweeps the sky!
<p>
<dt>Splendours of blossomed time, like poppies red,
<dt>Distil dull slumbers o'er the engaged soul
<dt>And thrall with sensuous pomp its azured dower;
<dt>Till, roused by vibrant touch from the unseen Power,
<dt>The spirit keen, freed from the painted dead,
<dt>On wings mounts up to reach its living Goal.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Willow at Grand-Pr&eacute;</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The fitful rustle of the sea-green leaves
<dt>Tells of the homeward tide, and free-blown air
<dt>Upturns thy gleaming leafage like a share--
<dt>A silvery foam thy bosom, as it heaves!
<dt>O peasant tree, the regal Bay doth bare
<dt>Its throbbing breast to ebbs and floods--and grieves!
<dt>O slender fronds, pale as a moonbeam weaves,
<dt>Joy woke your strain that trembles to despair!
<dt>Willow of Normandy, say, do the birds
<dt>Of Motherland plain in thy sea-chant low,
<dt>Or voice of those who brought thee in the ships
<dt>To tidal vales of Acadie? Vain words!
<dt>Grief unassuaged makes moan that Gaspereau
<dt>Bore on its flood the fleet with iron lips!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Glooscap</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Dim name, yet grand, that ever winks serene
<dt>In the red fagot's light, and like a ghost
<dt>Hovers above these raucous tides, this coast,
<dt>Wreathing weird webs of arrowy salts and keen!
<dt>Under the black-blue night's unroll&eacute;d screen
<dt>The loon is calling to the fiery host,
<dt>And yet no answer comes to keep thy boast--
<dt>Far years their mellow thunders roll between.
<dt>Divinest of the red man's race and name,
<dt>Fullness of Hiawatha's dawning day,
<dt>Giver of laws, priest, prophet, all confest!
<dt>Thou'lt come again, appeased thy wrath and shame,
<dt>Thy speed in all thy limbs, up yonder Bay
<dt>In white canoe from out the naked west.
