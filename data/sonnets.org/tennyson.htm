<p>
<dt>If I were loved, as I desire to be,
<dt>What is there in the great sphere of the earth,
<dt>And range of evil between death and birth,
<dt>That I should fear,--if I were loved by thee?
<dt>All the inner, all the outer world of pain
<dt>Clear Love would pierce and cleave, if thou wert mine
<dt>As I have heard that, somewhere in the main,
<dt>Fresh-water springs come up through bitter brine.
<dt>'T were joy, not fear, claspt hand-in-hand with thee,
<dt>To wait for death--mute--careless of all ills,
<dt>Apart upon a mountain, tho' the surge
<dt>Of some new deluge from a thousand hills
<dt>Flung leagues of roaring foam into the gorge
<dt>Below us, as far on as eye could see.
</p>
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>Poets and Their Bibliographies</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Old poets foster'd under friendlier skies,
<dt>Old Virgil who would write ten lines, they say,
<dt>At dawn, and lavish all the golden day
<dt>To make them wealthier in the readers' eyes;
<dt>And you, old popular Horace, you the wise
<dt>Adviser of the nine-years-ponder'd lay,
<dt>And you, that wear a wreath of sweeter bay,
<dt>Catullus, whose dead songster never dies;
<dt>If, glancing downward on the kindly sphere
<dt>That once had roll'd you round and round the sun,
<dt>You see your Art still shrined in human shelves,
<dt>You should be jubilant that you flourish'd here
<dt>Before the Love of Letters, overdone,
<dt>Had swamped the sacred poets with themselves.
</p>
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>Buonaparte</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>He thought to quell the stubborn hearts of oak,
<dt>Madman! to chain with chains, and bind with bands
<dt>That island queen who sways the floods and lands
<dt>From Ind to Ind, but in fair daylight woke,
<dt>When from her wooden walls,--lit by sure hands,--
<dt>With thunders and with lightnings and with smoke,--
<dt>Peal after peal, the British battle broke,
<dt>Lulling the brine against the Coptic sands.
<dt>We taught him lkowlier moods, when Elsinore
<dt>Heard the war moan along the distant sea,
<dt>Rocking with shattered spars, with sudden fires
<dt>Flamed over: at Trafalgar yet once more
<dt>We taught him: late he learned humility
<dt>Perforce, like those whom Gideon schooled with briars.
<p>
<a name=310></a><h2>Love and Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What time the mighty moon was gathering light,
<dt>Love paced the thymy plots of Paradise,
<dt>And all about him rolled his lustrous eyes;
<dt>When, turning round a cassia, full in view
<dt>Death, walking all alone beneath a yew
<dt>And talking to himself, first met his sight:
<dt>"You must begone," said death, "these walks are mine."
<dt>Love wept and spread his sheeny vans for flight;
<dt>Yet ere he parted said: "This hour is thine:
<dt>Thou art the shadow of life, and as the tree
<dt>Stands in the sun and shadows all beneath,
<dt>So in the light of great eternity
<dt>Life eminent creates the shade of death;
<dt>The shadow passeth when the tree shall fall,
<dt>But I shall reign for ever over all."
<p>
<a name=320></a><h2>A Question by Shelley</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>"Then what is life?" I cried. From his rent deeps
<dt>Of soul the poet cast that burning word;
<dt>And it should seem as though his prayer was heard,
<dt>For he died soon; and now his rest he keeps
<dt>Somewhere with the great spirit who never sleeps!
<dt>He had left us to murmur on awhile
<dt>And question still most fruitlessly this pile
<dt>Of natural shows, What life is? Why man weeps?
<dt>Why sins?--and whither when the awful veil
<dt>Floats on to him he sinks from earthly sight?
<dt>Some are, who never grow a whit more pale
<dt>For thinking on the general mystery,
<dt>Ground of all being; yet may I rather be
<dt>Of those who know and feel that it is night.
