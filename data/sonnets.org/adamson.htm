<p>"Verse may picture the feelings of the author, or it may only picture his fancy. To assume the former position, is not always safe; and in two memorable instances a series of sonnets has been used to construct a <i>baseless fabric</i> of biography.

<p>In the accompanying sonnet, there is no such uncertainty. It was communicated to me by John Adamson, Esq., M.R.S.L., &c., honourably known by a translation of the tragedy of <i>Dona Ignez de Castro</i>, from the Portuguese of Nicola Luiz, and by a <i>Memoir of the life and writings of Camoens</i>, &c. It was not intended for publication, but now appears, at my request.

<p>Mr. Adamson, it should be stated, is a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon, and has received diplomas of the orders of Christ and the Tower-and-Sword. The <i>coming storm</i> alludes to the menace of invasion by France."

<dt>O Portugal! whene'er I see thy name
<dt>What proud emotions rise within my breast!
<dt>To <i>thee</i> I owe--from <i>thee</i> derive that fame
<dt>Which here may linger when I lie at rest.
<dt>When as a youth I landed on thy shore,
<dt>How little did I think I e'er could be
<dt>Worthy the honours thou hast giv'n to me;
<dt>And when the coming storm I did deplore,
<dt>Drove me far from thee by its hostile threat--
<dt>With feelings which can never be effaced,
<dt>I learn'd to commune with those writers old
<dt>Who had the deeds of thy great chieftains told;
<dt>Departed bards in converse sweet I met,
<dt>I'd seen where they had liv'd--the land Camoens grac'd.
