<p>
<dt>Ere Greece soared, showering sovranties of light,
<dt>Ere Rome shook earth with her tremendous tread,
<dt>Ere yon blue-feasting sun-god burst blood-red,
<dt>Beneath thee slept thy prodigy, O Night!
<dt>Aeons have ta'en like dreams their strange, slow flight,
<dt>And vastest, tiniest, creatures paved her bed,
<dt>E'en cities sapped by the usurping spread
<dt>Of her imperious waves have sunk from sight
<dt>Since she first chanted her colossal psalms
<dt>That swell and sink beneath the listening stars;
<dt>Oft, as with myriad drums beating to arms,
<dt>She thunders out the grandeur of her wars;
<dt>Then shifts through moaning moods her wizard charms
<dt>Of slow flutes and caressing, gay guitars.

<p>
<dt>With eastern banners flaunting in the breeze
<dt>Royal processions, sounding fife and gong
<dt>And showering jewels on the jostling throng,
<dt>March to the tramp of Marlowe's harmonies.
<dt>He drained life's brimming goblet to the lees;
<dt>He recked not that a peer superb and strong
<dt>Would tune great notes to his impassioned song
<dt>And top his cannonading lines with ease.
<dt>To the wild clash of cymbals we behold
<dt>The tragic ending of his youthful life;
<dt>The revelry of kisses bought with gold,
<dt>The jest and jealous rival and the strife,
<dt>A harlot weeping o'er a corpse scarce cold,
<dt>A scullion fleeing with a bloody knife.
