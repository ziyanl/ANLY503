<p>
<dt>I see them in my dreams. Their tiny hands
<dt>Clutch feebly at the air; upon my face
<dt>Blows their sweet breath; a little voice demands
<dt>My eager kisses. In that soft embrace
<dt>A sense of aching, though I know not why,
<dt>A sense of some forgotten, longed-for joy,
<dt>A joy that thrills me through, yet makes me sigh,
<dt>That time could never change, nor death destroy;
<dt>Still in my dreams I clasp them to my breast,
<dt>Their soft warm presence folded close to mine;
<dt>And o'er me steals the balm of perfect rest,
<dt>And through my veins a gladness like to wine.
<dt>I murmur, shiver--then, as cold as stone,
<dt>Awake--and oh, dear God! awake alone!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Moonlight</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The storm is spent, the wind has died away;
<dt>Cool raindrops cling to trembling leaf and tree
<dt>As one departing lingers--loath to stay--
<dt>And yet departing more unwillingly.
<dt>The clouds have vanished from the purpled sky
<dt>Before the footsteps of the rising moon
<dt>(The queen whose jewelled courtiers prostrate lie
<dt>Dazed by the splendour of her silvered shoon).
<dt>The earth beneath, half-hidden, half-revealed,
<dt>Breathes mellowed beauty where each faery beam
<dt>Bathes kloof and vlei and kraal and mealie-field
<dt>And willows swaying sadly o'er a stream--
<dt>In light--wherein a mining shaft may seem
<dt>The angel's ladder of a poet's dream.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Storm</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>No breath of air. The fingers of the sun
<dt>Have touched a panting world with lambent fire,
<dt>And now the earth and heavens wrapped in one
<dt>Deep gloom, with dread await what both desire,
<dt>The eager wind comes sweeping through the street,
<dt>And atoms gathered here and scattered there
<dt>Are drawn again together till they meet,
<dt>And twisting strangely in the yellow glare
<dt>Assume unhallowed shapes. A hush, a thrill
<dt>Foretell great happenings. And by and by
<dt>A sudden blinding light--and all is still;
<dt>A crash--so might a Titan roar and die!
<dt>Then, sweet as sleep that lulls persistent pain.
<dt>In ever-swelling cadence falls the rain.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Dawn at Paardekraal</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The dim grey light comes stealing, and the stars
<dt>Melt swiftly, till at last the only one
<dt>Is left a watcher. Rosy, radiant bars
<dt>Of cloud foretell a day not yet begun.
<dt>The purple sky pales in the waking east
<dt>From blue to faintest green. The mountains stand
<dt>On the horizon's edge. Each bird and beast
<dt>Stirs in its sleep. A hush is o'er the land.
<dt>The light grows brighter. Trees and shrubs appear
<dt>Like wraiths that beckon dumbly in the gloom,
<dt>Mysterious shapes that slowly grow more clear,
<dt>Then--chirping birds, and flowers all a-bloom.
<dt>And lo! the Sun--wielding a molten spear,
<dt>Leaps, like a god, new-risen from his tomb.
