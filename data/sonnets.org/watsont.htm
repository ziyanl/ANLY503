<P>
<DT>I saw the object of my pining thought 
<DT>Within a garden of sweet nature's placing, 
<DT>Wherein an arbor, artificial wrought 
<DT>By workman's wondrous skill, the garden gracing, 
<DT>Did boast his glory, glory far renowned, 
<DT>For in his shady boughs my mistress slept; 
<DT>And with a garland of his branches crowned, 
<DT>Her dainty forehead from the sun ykept. 
<DT>Imperious love upon her eyelids tending, 
<DT>Playing his wanton sports at every beck 
<DT>And into every finest limb descending 
<DT>From eyes to lips, from lips to ivory neck, 
<DT>And every limb supplied, and t'every part 
<DT>Had free access, but durst not touch her heart.

<P></P>
<DT>Each tree did boast the wishèd spring-time's pride 
<DT>When solitary in the vale of love 
<DT>I hid myself, so from the world to hide 
<DT>The uncouth passions which my heart did prove, 
<DT>No tree whose branches did not bravely spring, 
<DT>No branch whereon a fine bird did not sit, 
<DT>No bird but did her shrill notes sweetly sing, 
<DT>No song but did contain a lovely dit. 
<DT>Trees, branches, birds, and songs were framèd fair, 
<DT>Fit to allure frail mind to careless ease; 
<DT>But careful was my thought, yet in despair 
<DT>I dwelt, for brittle hope me cannot please. 
<DT>For when I view my love's fair eyes' reflecting 
<DT>I entertain despair, vain hope rejecting.

<P></P>
<DT>In clouds she shines, and so obscurely shineth 
<DT>That like a mastless ship at seas I wander, 
<DT>For want of her to guide my heart that pineth, 
<DT>Yet can I not entreat ne yet command her. 
<DT>So am I tied in labyrinths of fancy, 
<DT>In dark and obscure labyrinths of love, 
<DT>That every one may plain behold that can see 
<DT>How I am fettered and what pains I prove. 
<DT>The lamp whose light should lead my ship about 
<DT>Is placed upon my mistress' heavenly face; 
<DT>Her hand doth hold the clew must lead me out 
<DT>And free my heart from thraldom's loathèd place 
<DT>But clew to lead my out, or lamp to light me, 
<DT>She scornfully denied--the more to spite me.
