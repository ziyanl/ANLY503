<a name=010></a><h2>Sonnet</h2>
<p>
<dt>I stood beside a pool, from whence ascended,
<dt>Mounting the cloudy platforms of the wind,
<dt>A stately heron; its soaring I attended,
<dt>Till it grew dim, and I with watching blind--
<dt>When lo! a shaft of arrowy light descended
<dt>Upon its darkness and its dim attire;
<dt>It straightway kindled them, and was afire,
<dt>And with the unconsuming radiance blended.
<p>
<dt>And bird, a cloud, flecking the sunny air,
<dt>It had its golden dwelling 'mid the lightning
<dt>Of those empyreal domes, and it might there
<dt>Have dwelt for ever, glorified and bright'ning,
<dt>But that its wings were weak--so it became
<dt>A dusky speck again, that was a winged flame.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Onward Course</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Our course is onward, onward into light:
<dt>What though the darkness gathereth amain,
<dt>Yet to return or tarry both are vain.
<dt>How tarry, when around us is thick night?
<dt>Whither return? what flower yet ever might,
<dt>In days of gloom and cold and stormy rain,
<dt>Enclose itself in its green bud again,
<dt>Hiding from wrath of tempest out of sight?
<p>
<dt>Courage--we travel through a darksome cave;
<dt>But still as nearer to the light we draw,
<dt>Fresh gales will reach us from the upper air
<dt>And wholesome dews of heaven our foreheads lave,
<dt>The darkness lighten more, till full of awe
<dt>We stand in the open sunshine unaware.

<dd>"His voice was as the sound
<dd>of many waters."
<p>
<dt>A sound of many waters!--now I know
<dt>To what was likened the large utterance sent
<dt>By Him who mid the golden lampads went:
<dt>Innumerable streams, above, below,
<dt>Some seen, some heard alone, with headlong flow
<dt>Come rushing; some with smooth and sheer descent,
<dt>Some dashed to foam and whiteness, but all blent
<dt>Into one mighty music.
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As I go,
<dt>The tumult of a boundless gladness fills
<dt>My bosom, and my spirit leaps and sings:
<dt>Sounds and sights are there of the ancient hills,
<dt>The eagle's cry, the mountain when it flings
<dt>Mists from its brow, but none of all these things
<dt>Like the one voice of multitudinous rills.
