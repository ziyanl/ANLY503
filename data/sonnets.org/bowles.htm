<P>A vicar's son, Bowles toured northern England in the 1780s, and the resulting collection, his influential <a href "http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Romantic/bowles1789.html">Fourteen Sonnets</a> (1789) (University of Pennsylvania website) was a reaction against the classicism of Pope and other writers of the preceding period. His work was admired by Coleridge, Wordsworth, and a large public.

<a name=050></a><h2>"O Time! who know'st a lenient hand to lay"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>O Time! who know'st a lenient hand to lay
<dt>Softest on sorrow's wound, and slowly thence,
<dt>Lulling to sad repose the weary sense,
<dt>The faint pang stealest unperceived away;
<dt>On thee I rest my only hope at last,
<dt>And think, when thou hast dried the bitter tear
<dt>That flows in vain o'er all my soul held dear,
<dt>I may look back on every sorrow past,
<dt>And meet life's peaceful evening with a smile;
<dt>As some lone bird, at day's departing hour,
<dt>Sings in the sunbeam, of the transient shower
<dt>Forgetful, though its wings are wet the while:
<dt>Yet ah! how much must that poor heart endure,
<dt>Which hopes from thee, and thee alone, a cure!
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>On a Beautiful Landscape</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Beautiful landscape! I could look on thee
<dt>For hours,--unmindful of the storm and strife,
<dt>And mingled murmurs of tumultuous life.
<dt>Here, all is still as fair--the stream, the tree,
<dt>The wood, the sunshine on the bank: no tear
<dt>No thought of time's swift wing, or closing night
<dt>Which comes to steal away the long sweet light,
<dt>No sighs of sad humanity are here.
<p>
<dt>Here is no tint of mortal change--the day
<dt>Beneath whose light the dog and peasant-boy
<dt>Gambol with look, and almost bark, of joy--
<dt>Still seems, though centuries have passed, to stay.
<dt>Then gaze again, that shadowed scenes may teach
<dt>Lessons of peace and love, beyond all speech.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>To a Friend</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Go, then, and join the murmuring city's throng!
<dt>Me thou dost leave to solitude and tears;
<dt>To busy phantasies, and boding fears,
<dt>Lest ill betide thee; but 't will not be long
<dt>Ere the hard season shall be past; till then
<dt>Live happy; sometimes the forsaken shade
<dt>Remembering, and these trees now left to fade;
<dt>Nor, mid the busy scenes and hum of men,
<dt>Wilt thou my cares forget: in heaviness
<dt>To me the hours shall roll, weary and slow,
<dt>Till mournful autumn past, and all the snow
<dt>Of winter pale, the glad hour I shall bless
<dt>That shall restore thee from the crowd again,
<dt>To the green hamlet on the peaceful plain.
</P>
<a name=200></a><h2>Netley Abbey</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Fallen pile! I ask not what has been thy fate;
<dt>But when the winds, slow wafted from the main,
<dt>Through each rent arch, like spirits that complain,
<dt>Come hollow to my ear, I meditate
<dt>On this world's passing pageant, and the lot
<dt>Of those who once majestic in their prime
<dt>Stood smiling at decay, till bowed by time
<dt>Or injury, their early boast forgot,
<dt>They may have fallen like thee! Pale and forlorn,
<dt>Their brow, besprent with thin hairs, white as snow,
<dt>They lift, still unsubdued, as they would scorn
<dt>This short-lived scene of vanity and woe;
<dt>Whilst on their sad looks smilingly they bear
<dt>The trace of creeping age, and the pale hue of care!
</P>

<h3><i>On hearing the Bells at Sea</i></h3>
<P>
<dt>How sweet the tuneful bells' responsive peal!
<dt>As when at opening dawn the fragrant breeze
<dt>Touches the trembling sense of pale disease,
<dt>So piercing to my heart their force I feel.
<dt>And hark! with lessening cadence now they fall,
<dt>And now along the white and level tide
<dt>They fling their melancholy music wide;
<dt>Bidding me many a tender thought recall
<dt>Of summer days, and those delightful years
<dt>When by my native streams, in life's fair prime,
<dt>The mournful magic of their mingling chime
<dt>First waked my wondering childhood into tears!
<dt>But seeming now, when all those days are o'er,
<dt>The sounds of joy once heard and heard no more.
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>In Youth</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Milton, our noblest poet, in the grace
<dt>Of youth, in those fair eyes and clustering hair,
<dt>That brow untouched by one faint line of care,
<dt>To mar its openness, we seem to trace
<dt>The front of the first lord of the human race,
<dt>Mid thine own Paradise portrayed so fair,
<dt>Ere Sin or Sorrow scathed it: such the air
<dt>That characters thy youth. Shall time efface
<dt>These lineaments as crowding cares assail!
<dt>It is the lot of fallen humanity.
<dt>What boots it! armed in adamantine mail,
<dt>The unconquerable mind, and genius high,
<dt>Right onward hold their way through weal and woe,
<dt>Or whether life's brief lot be high or low!
</P>
<a name=400></a><h2>In Age</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>And art thou he, now "fallen on evil days,"
<dt>And changed indeed! Yet what do this sunk cheek,
<dt>These thinner locks, and that calm forehead speak!
<dt>A spirit reckless of man's blame or praise,--
<dt>A spirit, when thine eyes to the noon's blaze
<dt>Their dark orbs roll in vain, in suffering meek,
<dt>As in the sight of God intent to seek,
<dt>Mid solitude or age, or through the ways
<dt>Of hard adversity, the approving look
<dt>Of its great Master; whilst the conscious pride
<dt>Of wisdom, patient and content to brook
<dt>All ills to that sole Master's task applied,
<dt>Shall show before high heaven the unaltered mind,
<dt>Milton, though thou art poor, and old, and blind!
<p>
<a name=410></a><h2>The Rhine</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It was morn, and beauteous on the mountain's brow
<dt>(Hung with the clusters of the bending vine)
<dt>Shone in the early light, when on the Rhine
<dt>We bounded, and the white waves round the prow
<dt>In murmurs parted;--varying as we go,
<dt>Lo! the woods open and the rocks retire,
<dt>As some grey convent-wall or glistening spire
<dt>Mid the bright landscape's track unfolding slow!
<dt>Here, dark with furrowed aspect, like despair
<dt>Frowns the bleak cliff! There, on the woodland's side
<dt>The shadowy sunshine pours its gleaming tide;
<dt>Whilst hope, enchanted with the scene so fair,
<dt>Counts not the hours of a long summer's day,
<dt>Nor heeds how fast the prospect winds away.
<p>
<a name=420></a><h2>On Hearing "The Messiah" Performed in Gloucester Cathedral</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O stay, harmonious and sweet sounds, that die
<dt>In the long vaultings of this ancient fane!
<dt>Stay, for I may not hear on earth again
<dt>Those pious airs--that glorious harmony;
<dt>Lifting the soul to brighter orbs on high,
<dt>Worlds without sin or sorrow! Ah, the strain
<dt>Has died--even the last sounds that lingeringly
<dt>Hung on the roof ere they expired!
<dd>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And I
<dt>Stand in the world of strife, amidst a throng,
<dt>A throng that reckons not of death or sin!
<dt>Oh, jarring scenes! to cease, indeed, ere long;
<dt>The worm hears not the discord and the din;
<dt>But he whose heart thrills to this angel song
<dt>Feels the pure joy of heaven on earth begin!
