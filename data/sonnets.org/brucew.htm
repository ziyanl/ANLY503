<h2>A Star-eyed Daisy</h2>
<h3>San Marco,   St. Augustine</h3>
<h4>(Tri-centennial   Anniversary, 1886)</h4>
<p>
<dt>Ensigns of empires flaunt thy flanking wall,
<dt>Grim ancient warders guard thy storied gate,
<dt>Loud Babeled centuries at thy bastions wait
<dt>On Spanish, French, and English seneschal.
<dt>Rich yellow folds of Castile's haughty state,
<dt>Fair Fleur de Lys from proud Parisian hall,
<dt>St. George's Cross triumphant o'er them all,
<dt>Recall long years of fierce and bloody hate.
<dt>
<dt>But now the star-eyed daisy lifts its form
<dt>From crevice, chink, and crumbling parapet,
<dt>Without one stain of battle's crimson storm
<dt>On snowy leaf with golden petal set:
<dt>Bright banneret which Nature kindly rears
<dt>To deck with light the mould of bitter years.

The Stranger</h2>        
<h3>
An Eastern Legend</h3>        
<dt>        
      

An aged man came late to Abraham's tent.        
<dt>        
      

The sky was dark, and all the plain was bare.        
<dt>        
      

He asked for bread; his strength was wellnigh spent,        
<dt>        
      

His haggard look implored the tenderest care.        
<dt>        
      

The food was brought.&nbsp; He sat with thankful eyes,        
<dt>        
      

But spake no grace, nor bowed he towards the east.        
<dt>        
      

Safe sheltered here from dark and angry skies,        
<dt>        
      

The bounteous table seemed a royal feast.        
<dt>        
      

But ere his hand had touched the tempting fare,        
<dt>        
      

 The Patriarch rose, and leaning on his rod—        
<dt>        
      

"Stranger," he said, "dost thou not bow in prayer?        
<dt>        
      

Dost thou not fear, dost thou not worship God?"        
<dt>        
      

  He answered, "Nay."&nbsp; The Patriarch sadly said:        
<dt>        
      

"Thou hast my pity.&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; eat not my bread."        
<p></p>        
      

          
<dt>        
      

  Another came that wild and fearful night.        
<dt>        
      

 The fierce&nbsp;winds raged, and darker grew the sky;        
<dt>        
      

But all the tent was filled with wondrous light,        
<dt>        
      

 And Abraham knew the&nbsp;Lord his God was nigh.        
<dt>        
      

   "Where is that aged man?"&nbsp;the&nbsp;Presence said,        
<dt>        
      

 "That asked for shelter from the driving blast?        
<dt>        
      

 Who made thee master of thy Master's bread?        
<dt>        
      

What right hadst thou the wanderer forth to cast?"        
<dt>        
      

  "Forgive me, Lord," the Patriarch answer made,        
<dt>        
      

 With downcast look, with bowed and trembling knee.        
<dt>        
      

"Ah me!&nbsp; the stranger might with me have stayed,        
<dt>        
      

  But, O my&nbsp;God,&nbsp;he would not worship Thee."        
<dt>        
      

"I've        
      

borne him long," God said, "and still I wait:        
<dt>        
      

Couldst        
      

thou not lodge him one night in thy gate?"        
<dt>

<dt>
<h3>New York and Brooklyn, 1883</h3>        
      

               

<dt>      
      

The nuptial-knot at last is firmly tied;<dt>      
      

A hundred bells ring out a merry chime,<dt>      
      

A hundred wires proclaim to every clime—<dt>      
      

Manhattan takes fair Brooklyn for his bride.<dt>      
      

In strength and beauty growing side by side,<dt>      
      

Cities betrothed, you waited vigorous prime,<dt>      
      

Like steadfast lovers in the olden time,<dt>      
      

Ere greed and gain our early faith defied.<p></p>
<dt>      
      

We wish you joy.&nbsp; No longer twain, but one,<dt>      
      

Forever bound in links of triple steel;<dt>      
      

You need no marriage ritual to rehearse,<dt>      
      

Which Venice chanted to bright Adria won;<dt>      
      

No golden ring; the service now is real—<dt>      
      

"Each other take for better or for worse."<dt>
<h2><a name="longfellow"></a>Longfellow</h2>      
      

       <dt>      
      

Again I see him on the sunlit lawn,<dt>      
      

As in the May-day of that final year,<dt>      
      

With brow as radiant as the early dawn,<dt>      
      

 And eye transparent as the heavens clear.<dt>      
      

With cloak o'er shoulder thrown in careless grace,<dt>      
      

He stands enframed in budding flowers and trees,<dt>      
      

  A genial Orpheus, with Olympian face<dt>      
      

  Forever fanned by pure Arcadian breeze.<dt>      
      

Ah, more to me than Prospero's magic isle<dt>      
      

The paths and greensward where the poet dreamed;<dt>      
      

 The opening blossoms wooed his kindly smile,<dt>      
      

 The expectant flowers with richer colors gleamed.<dt>My      
      

soul still clasps the warm and generous hand<dt>      
      

Which wields the sceptre of a kingless land.<dt>
<h2><a name="picture"></a>To a Picture of Mary Stuart</h2>      
      

       <dt>When      
      

I do note the beauty of thine eyes,<dt>And      
      

think that they have long been sightless dust;<dt>      
      

 When I observe the warrior's envied prize—<dt>      
      

  Helmet and corselet—thick with yellow rust;<dt>      
      

When scutcheoned doors lie prone in castle halls,<dt>      
      

 And turrets totter, razed by ruthless Time;<dt>      
      

 When panelled brass from stately column falls,<dt>      
      

 Well-graved with praises writ in lofty rhyme—<dt>      
      

Then I perceive how all things here decay;<dt>That      
      

this wide world is but a shifting stage,<dt>Where      
      

faith and love, fierce pride and passion, play,<dt>      
      

And narrow lines divide the fool and sage;<dt>      
      

Where fame's brief candle flickers to its death<dt>      
      

And beauty's reign is measured by a breath.<dt>
<h2><a name="paris"></a>Paris to Helen</h2>      
      

       <dt>      
      

  Imperial beauty, born for Ilium's blight;<dt>      
      

  Sweet, winsome Helen, paragon of earth;<dt>Would      
      

that our flocks were still on Ida's height,<dt>      
      

 And princely halls unemptied of their mirth!<dt>      
      

Alas!&nbsp; proud Troy is tottering to her fall;<dt>      
      

Our promised joys are steeped in bitter pain;<dt>      
      

 Kinsmen and Greek in deep derision call,<dt>      
      

 And every eye speaks loathing and disdain.<dt>      
      

Dear bribe of Venus!&nbsp; why were we beguiled<dt>      
      

By Cyprian words to walk in devious ways,<dt>      
      

 And leave our names as synonymes reviled<dt>      
      

    Forevermore through unforgiving days?<dt>      
      

 O fruitless passion, won at honor's cost!<dt>      
      

   Faith, courage, glory—all forever lost.<dt>
<h2><a name="infinite"></a>The Infinite</h2>      
      

       <dt>With      
      

measuring lines we reach from star to star,<dt>      
      

 On pinion bold we seek creation's rim,<dt>      
      

 The vast horizon mocks us from afar<dt>      
      

With sphere on sphere beyond our vision dim;<dt>      
      

On weary wing our thought, from voyage vain,<dt>Like      
      

that lone dove, with neither leaf nor bud,<dt>      
      

 Returns to find the windowed ark again—<dt>      
      

 A floating refuge on a shoreless flood.<dt>      
      

 O mystery vast which veils the sovereign&nbsp;brow!<dt>      
      

 O vergeless silence, depths by light untrod!<dt>      
      

  Space without centre!&nbsp; Time, eternal now!<dt>      
      

 O star-gemmed vesture!&nbsp; Seamless robe of God!<dt>      
      

 What word doth this vast Universe inthrall!<dt>      
      

  Bounded by nothing, yet embracing all.<dt>
<h2><a name="juliet"></a>Juliet to Romeo</h2>      
      

       <dt>      
      

One more fond kiss, my Romeo, and away!<dt>      
      

The eastern hills are touched with rosy light.<dt>Ah      
      

love, with thee dun night is brightest day,<dt>And      
      

brightest day, when thou art gone, is night.<dt>      
      

How blest the hours swift-borne on starry wheels!<dt>      
      

 How heavy waiting on the laggard sun!<dt>      
      

A weary void till day her eyelids seals,<dt>      
      

And Heaven's high warders guard love's fortress won.<dt>Dear      
      

Romeo, go!&nbsp; Yet I would have thee stay.<dt>      
      

O pilfering morn, that robs the jewelled skies!<dt>      
      

  Purloining gems within thy mantle gray,<dt>Take all,      
      

but leave the one dear star I prize.<dt>      
      

Alas!&nbsp; that love from love should ever part;<dt>      
      

Yon sunrise brings wan sunset to my heart.<dt>
<h2><a name="antony"></a>Antony to Cleopatra</h2>      
      

       <dt>      
      

  My Cleopatra, queen, alas the day<dt>      
      

 Thy lustrous eyes proclaimed such bitter doom!<dt>      
      

That shame and Antony should live for aye,<dt>      
      

  An epitaph on Time's enduring tomb!<dt>      
      

   Soft-coiling serpent!&nbsp; Thy enticing wiles<dt>      
      

Hold heroes captive in strong toils of grace;<dt>For      
      

power is lost in passion, as fond smiles<dt>      
      

Light up the matchless beauty of thy face.<dt>      
      

  Cold duty summons; but, enchantress fair,<dt>      
      

 My courage melts beneath thy glowing eyes;<dt>And      
      

in thine arms I neither reck nor care<dt>      
      

 If Roman honor lives or basely dies.<dt>      
      

Let Fame's rich pearl dissolve in nectar bright!<dt>      
      

 Farewell to valor—day is lost in night.<dt>
<h2><a name="ferdinand"></a>Ferdinand to Miranda</h2>      
      

       <dt>      
      

 Miranda mine, thy beauty is more rare<dt>      
      

Than May-day flowers that deck the meadows green;<dt>      
      

Thy lips are sweeter than the lily fair<dt>Plucked      
      

fresh at dawn from out the glittering sheen;<dt>      
      

The mantling color of thy cheek's bright hue<dt>      
      

Makes pale and shames the blood of damask-rose;<dt>      
      

 Thine eye preserves the violet's pensive blue,<dt>Which,      
      

born of light, with Heaven's own color glows;<dt>Thy      
      

neck, full sweet, seems like a flowery lane,<dt>      
      

 Or garden pathway, to thy gentle breast,<dt>      
      

Where love, that knows not passion's earthly stain,<dt>      
      

Has dwelt alone and wished no other guest.<dt>      
      

 Here Eden's flowers retain the morning dew,<dt>And sweeter seem united all in you.<dt>&nbsp;<dt>
