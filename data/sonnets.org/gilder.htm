<a name=010></a><h2>The Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What is a sonnet? 'Tis the pearly shell
<dt>That murmurs of the far-off murmuring sea;
<dt>A precious jewel carved most curiously:
<dt>It is a little picture painted well.
<dt>What is a sonnet? 'Tis the tear that fell
<dt>From a great poet's hidden ecstasy;
<dt>A two-edged sword, a star, a song--ah me!
<dt>Sometimes a heavy-tolling funeral bell.
<dt>This was the flame that shook with Dante's breath;
<dt>The solemn organ whereon Milton played,
<dt>And the clear glass where Shakespeare's shadow falls:
<dt>A sea this is--beware who ventureth!
<dt>For like a fjord the narrow floor is laid
<dt>Mid-ocean deep to the sheer mountain walls.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>"Day unto Day Uttereth Speech"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The speech that day doth utter, and the night,
<dt>Full oft to mortal ears it hath no sound;
<dt>Dull are our eyes to read upon the ground
<dt>What's written there; and stars are hid by light.
<dt>So when the dark doth fall, awhile our sight
<dt>Kens the unwonted orbs that circle round,
<dt>The quick in sleep our human sense is bound;
<dt>Speechless for us the starry heavens and bright.
<dt>But when the day doth close there is one word
<dt>That's writ amid the sunset's golden embers;
<dt>And one at morn; by them our hearts are stirred:
<dt>Splendour of dawn,--and Evening that remembers;
<dt>These are the rhymes of God; thus, line on line,
<dt>Our souls are moved to thoughts that are divine.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Written on a Fly-Leaf of "Shakespeare's Sonnets"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When shall true love be love without alloy:
<dt>Shine free at last from sinful circumstance!
<dt>When shall the canker of unheavenly chance
<dt>Eat not the bud of that most heavenly joy!
<dt>When shall true love meet love not as a coy
<dt>Retreating light that leads a deathful dance,
<dt>But as a firm fixed fire that doth enhance
<dt>The beauty of all beauty! Will the employ
<dt>Of poets ever be too well to show
<dt>That mightiest love with sharpest pain doth writhe;
<dt>That underneath the fair, caressing glove
<dt>Hides evermore the iron hand; and though
<dt>Love's flower alone is good, if we could prove
<dt>Its perfect bloom, our breath slays like a scythe!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>"My Love for Thee Doth March Like Arm&eacute;d Men"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My love for thee doth march like arm&eacute;d men
<dt>Against a queenly city they would take.
<dt>Along the army's front its banners shake;
<dt>Across the mountain and the sun-smit plain
<dt>It steadfast sweeps the steadfast rain;
<dt>And now the trumpet makes the still air quake,
<dt>And now the thundering cannon doth awake
<dt>Echo on echo, echoing loud again.
<dt>But, lo! the conquest higher than bard had sung;
<dt>Instead of answering cannon comes a small
<dt>White flag; the iron gates are open flung,
<dt>And flowers along the invaders' pathway fall.
<dt>The city's conquerors feast their foes among,
<dt>And their brave flags are trophies on her wall.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The River</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I know thou art not that brown mountain-side,
<dt>Nor the pale mist that lies along the hills
<dt>And with white joy the deepening valley fills;
<dt>Nor yet the solemn river moving wide
<dt>Into that valley, where the hills abide
<dt>But whence those morning clouds on noiseless wheels
<dt>Shall lingering lift and, as the moonlight steals
<dt>From out the heavens, so into the heavens shall glide.
<dt>I know thou art not this gray rock that looms
<dt>Above the water, fringed with scarlet vine;
<dt>Nor flame of burning meadow; nor the sedge
<dt>That sways and trembles at the river's edge.
<dt>But through all these, dear heart! to me there comes
<dt>Some melancholy, absent look of thine.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Weal and Woe</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O highest, strongest, sweetest woman-soul!
<dt>Thou holdest in the compass of thy grace
<dt>All the strange fate and passion of thy race:
<dt>Of the old, primal curse thou knowest the whole:
<dt>Thine eyes, too wise, are heavy with the dole,
<dt>The doubt, the dread of all this human maze;
<dt>Thou in the virgin morning of thy days
<dt>Hast felt the bitter waters o'er thee roll.
<dt>Yet thou knowest, too, the terrible delight,
<dt>The still content, and solemn ecstasy
<dt>Whatever sharp, sweet bliss thy kind may know.
<dt>Thy spirit is deep for pleasure as for woe--
<dt>Deep as the rich, dark-caverned, awful sea
<dt>That the keen winded, glimmering dawn makes white.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Holy Land</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>This is the earth he walked on; not alone
<dt>That Asian country keeps the sacred stain;
<dt>'Tis not alone the far Judaean plain,
<dt>Mountain and river! Lo, the sun that shone
<dt>On him shines now on us; when day is gone
<dt>The moon of Galilee comes forth again
<dt>And lights our path as his: an endless chain
<dt>Of years and sorrows makes the round world one.
<dt>The air we breathe, he breathed,--the very air
<dt>That took the mould and music of his high
<dt>And godlike speech.--Since then shall mortal dare
<dt>With base thought front the ever-sacred sky,--
<dt>Soil with foul deed the ground whereon he laid
<dt>In holy death his pale, immortal head!
