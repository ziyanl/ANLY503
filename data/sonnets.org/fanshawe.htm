<p>
<dt>When last we parted, thou wert young and fair,
<dt>How beautiful let fond remembrance say!
<dt>Alas! since then old time has stolen away
<dt>Full thirty years, leaving my temples bare.--
<dt>So has it perished like a thing of air,
<dt>The dream of love and youth!--now both are grey
<dt>Yet still remembering that delightful day,
<dt>Though time with his cold touch has blanched my hair,
<dt>Though I have suffered many years of pain
<dt>Since then, though I did never think to live
<dt>To hear that voice or see those eyes again,
<dt>I can a sad but cordial greeting give,
<dt>And for thy welfare breathe as warm a prayer--
<dt>As when I loved thee young and fair!
