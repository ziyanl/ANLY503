<a name=010></a><h2>Virtue and Delight</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It is a strange thing, but an excellent,
<dt>That virtue with delight is seldom wed,
<dt>For still it happens that some accident
<dt>Doth keep the excelling stranger from her bed:
<dt>So think I, that the elements combine
<dt>Against the occurrence of such blissful woe,
<dt>Nor ever are the planets now in trine
<dt>To make soft light upon this meeting flow.
<p>
<dt>Ah me, the armour that Achilles wore
<dt>Was made with sweat and with a toiling brow,
<dt>And worn with sweat, and of all love forlore;
<dt>As ever in this age we find it now:
<dt>Who thinks to rise above his equal peers
<dt>Must yield to death after long-toilsome years.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Fancy</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sometimes upon the hills in thought I stand
<dt>And travel on the wings of fantasy;
<dt>With what delight the glob&eacute;d earth is spanned,
<dt>With how soft foot the wing&eacute;d moments fly!
<dt>A silent dream environs me around;
<dt>I am not what I am; I am not here;
<dt>But yet I walk upon my wonted ground,
<dt>But yet the woods unto my sight appear;
<dt>The woods, in which from morn till mournful eve
<dt>I wander, and would shroud myself from day;
<dt>And envy even the fox, whom caves receive
<dt>And fast secure him from the glaring ray;
<dt>This body and machine, indeed, is here;
<dt>But flies my soul into a higher sphere.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Beauty and Desire</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It is much immortal beauty to admire,
<dt>But more immortal beauty to withstand;
<dt>The perfect soul can overcome desire
<dt>If beauty with divine delight be scanned;
<dt>For what is beauty but the blooming child
<dt>Of fair Olympus, that in night must end
<dt>And be for ever from that bliss exiled,
<dt>If admiration stand too much its friend?
<p>
<dt>The wind may be enamoured of a flower,
<dt>The ocean of the green and laughing shore,
<dt>The silver lightning of a lofty tower,
<dt>But must not with too near a love adore;
<dt>Or flower, and margin, and cloud-capped tower
<dt>Love and delight shall with delight devour!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>On the Road to Tunbridge</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O Tunbridge, I approach thee with delight,
<dt>That hast from many streams thy lovely name,
<dt>Thy hop-gardens are blooming to the sight,
<dt>Thy orchards of rich growth are dear to fame:
<dt>Not in all Kent, in wealthy Kent, is found
<dt>A vale more beauteous to the farmer's eye,
<dt>Meads that with wheat and barley more abound,
<dt>Or a more growth of luscious grass supply:
<p>
<dt>Thy Castle on the silent Medway stands
<dt>And mournfully overlooks the laughing town,
<dt>But thy fair school, upbuilt by pious hands,
<dt>Demands the poet's lays and verdant crown:
<dt>There Virgil and great Homer well are taught,
<dt>Virtue well prized, and evil set at nought.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Nightfall</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The ruddy-purpled day in light retires,
<dt>The shrieking owlets wanton in the air,
<dt>And others hoot to see the rising fires
<dt>Of Hesperus exalt their glory fair;
<dt>The cattle low from out their stabled yard,
<dt>From house to house the chiding dog is heard,
<dt>And now the hamlets, that have laboured hard
<dt>The live-long day, have their sweet toil deferred:
<dt>Above, the moon her silver orbit wheels
<dt>With pale delight, like fitful tragedy;
<dt>And to the shepherd his damp path reveals,
<dt>That to the longing arms of Madge doth hie:
<dt>In cities now they play great scenes to kings,
<dt>Whilst here muse I, and think of deeper things.
