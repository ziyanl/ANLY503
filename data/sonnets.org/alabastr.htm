<p>
<dt>With heat and cold I feel the spiteful fiend
<dt>To work one mischief by two contraries,
<dt>With lust he doth me scorch, with languor freeze,
<dt>But lust and languor both one Christ offend.
<dt>Let contraries with contraries contend,
<dt>Let fear of blame and love of Christ arise,
<dt>Hot love of Christ to melt in tears mine eyes,
<dt>Cold fear of just reproach my shame to extend,
<dt>That shame with heat may cool my looser thought,
<dt>And tears with cold heat my heart's sluggish deep.
<dt>O happy I if that such grace were wrought!
<dt>Till then, shame blush because tears cannot weep,
<dt>And tears weep you because shame cannot blush,
<dt>Till shame from tears, and tears from shame do flush.
<p>
<a name=101></a><h2>"My friends, whose kindness doth their judgments blind"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My friends, whose kindness doth their judgments blind,
<dt>Know you, say they, the dangers where you run,
<dt>Which zeal hides from you, but compassion
<dt>Tells us? You feel the blow, the smart we find.
<dt>I know it well, and as I call to mind,
<dt>This is the bill: dearness, affection,
<dt>Friends, fortune, pleasure, fame, hope, life undone,
<dt>Want, prison, torment, death, shame--what behind?
<dt>Is then my sense transel'mented to steel,
<dt>That neither this, nor that, nor all, can feel,
<dt>Nor can it bend my mind, which theirs doth break?
<dt>Not so, nor so; for I am not insensate,
<dt>But feel a double grief that for Christ's sake
<dt>I have no more to spend, nor have spent that.
<p>
<a name=102></a><h2>"Lord, I have left all and myself behind"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lord, I have left all and myself behind:
<dt>My state, my hopes, my strength, and present ease,
<dt>My unprovok&egrave;d studies' sweet disease,
<dt>And touch of nature and engrafted kind,
<dt>Whose cleaving twist doth distant tempers bind;
<dt>And gentle sense of kindness that doth praise
<dt>The earnest judgments, others' wills to please;
<dt>All and myself I leave, thy love to find.
<dt>O strike my heart with lightning from above,
<dt>That from one wound both fire and blood may spring;
<dt>Fire to transelement my soul to love,
<dt>And blood as oil to keep the fire burning;
<dt>That fire may draw forth blood, blood extend fire,
<dt>Desire possession, possession desire.
<p>
<a name=201></a><h2>"The night, the starless night of passion"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The night, the starless night of passion
<dt>From heaven began, on heaven beneath to fall,
<dt>When Christ did sound the onset martial,
<dt>A sacred hymn, upon his foes to run;
<dt>That with the fiery contemplation
<dt>Of love and joy, his soul and senses all
<dt>Surcharged might not dread the bitter thrall
<dt>Of pain and grief and torments all in one.
<dt>Then since my holy vows have undertook
<dt>To take the portrait of Christ's death in me,
<dt>Then let my love with sonnets fill this book,
<dt>With hymns to give the onset as did he;
<dt>That thoughts inflam&egrave;d with such heavenly muse
<dt>The coldest ice of fire may not refuse.
<p>
<a name=202></a><h2>"Over the brook of Cedron Christ is gone"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Over the brook of Cedron Christ is gone,
<dt>To entertain the combat with his death,
<dt>Where David fled beforetime void of breath
<dt>To scape the treacheries of Absalon.
<dt>Go, let us follow him in passion,
<dt>Over this brook, this world that walloweth,
<dt>A stream of cares that drown our thoughts beneath,
<dt>And wash away all resolution.
<dt>Beyond the world he must be pass&egrave;d clear,
<dt>That in the world for Christ will troubles bear:
<dt>Leave we, O leave we then this miry flood,
<dt>Friends, pleasures, and unfaithful good.
<dt>Now we are up, now down, but cannot stand;
<dt>We sink, we reel; Jesu, stretch forth thy hand.
<p>
<a name=202a></a><h2>"Up to Mount Olivet my soul ascend"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Up to Mount Olivet my soul ascend
<dt>The mount spiritual, and there supply
<dt>Thy fainting lamp with oil of charity
<dt>To make the light of faith the more extend.
<dt>Go by this tract which thither right doth tend,
<dt>Which Christ did first beat forth to walk thereby,
<dt>And sixteen ages of posterity
<dt>Have gone it over since from end to end.
<dt>But strike not down to any new-found balk,
<dt>Which hunters have begun of late to chalk:
<dt>For whether 'twere the glow-worm faith went out,
<dt>Or want of love did pine them in the way,
<dt>Or else the cruel devils rob or slay,
<dt>No news comes back of one of all that rout.
<p>
<a name=203></a><h2>"Though all forsake thee, Lord, yet I will die"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Though all forsake thee, Lord, yet I will die;
<dt>For I have chain&egrave;d so my will to thine
<dt>That I have no will left my will to untwine,
<dt>But will abide with thee most willingly.
<dt>Though all forsake thee, Lord, yet cannot I;
<dt>For love hath wrought in me thy form divine
<dt>That thou art more my heart than heart is mine:
<dt>How can I then from myself, thyself, fly?
<dt>Thus thought Saint Peter, and thus thinking, fell;
<dt>And by his fall did warn us not to swell.
<dt>Yet still in love I say I would not fall,
<dt>And say in hope, I trust I never shall;
<dt>But cannot say in faith what might I do
<dt>To learn to say it, by hearing Christ say so.
<p>
<a name=204></a><h2>"Jesus is risen from the infernal mire"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Jesus is risen from the infernal mire:
<dt>But who art thou that say'st Jesus arose?
<dt>Such holy words are only fit for those
<dt>Whose souls with Christ above the heavens aspire.
<dt>But if thou hast not rais&egrave;d thy desire
<dt>From earth to heaven, but in the world dost close
<dt>Thy love which unto heaven thou shouldst dispose,
<dt>Say not that Christ is yet ascended higher,
<dt>But yet within thy heart he lieth dead,
<dt>And by the devil is impoison&egrave;d.
<dt>Rejoice not then in vain of his ascent;
<dt>For as his glorious rise doth much augment
<dt>All good men's hopes, so unto those that tread
<dt>False paths, it is a dreadful argument.
<p>
<a name=205></a><h2>"The earth, which in delicious paradise"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The earth, which in delicious paradise
<dt>Did bud forth man like cedars stately tall,
<dt>From barren womb accurs&egrave;d by the fall
<dt>Doth thrust forth man as thorns in arm&eagrave;d wise,
<dt>Darting the points of sin against the skies.
<dt>With those thorns plaited was Christ's coronal,
<dt>Which crowned him then with grief, but after all
<dt>In heaven shall crown him, crown themselves with glory.
<dt>For with the purple tincture of his blood,
<dt>Which out the furrows of his brows did rain,
<dt>He hath transformed us thorns from baser wood
<dt>To raise our nature and od&oacute;rant strain,
<dt>That we, who with our thorny sins did wound him,
<dt>Hereafter should with roseal virtues crown him.
<p>
<a name=206></a><h2>"Eternity, the womb of things created"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Eternity, the womb of things created,
<dt>The endless bottom of duration,
<dt>Whose half was always past, yet unbegun,
<dt>And half behind still coming unabated;
<dt>Whose thread conjoin&egrave;d, both unseparated,
<dt>Is time, which dated is by motion;
<dt>Eternity, whose real thoughts are one
<dt>With God, that is everness actuated:
<dt>O tie my soul unto this endless clew,
<dt>That I may overfathom fate and time
<dt>In all my actions which I do pursue,
<dt>And bound my thoughts in that unbounded clime:
<dt>For soul and thoughts, designs and acts, are evil,
<dt>That under compass of this life do level.
<p>
<a name=207></a><h2>"The first beginning of creation"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The first beginning of creation
<dt>Was God; the end thereof in man was set;
<dt>End and beginning were together met;
<dt>So God and man became one person.
<dt>Thus nature's circle as a ring doth run,
<dt>Christ is the pale within whose circulet
<dt>The seal of the divinity is knit,
<dt>Which seal doth stand the Godhead's ring upon.
<dt>So stand two rings upon one diamond;
<dt>The knot of both and either, where are met
<dt>Finite and infinite, more and one
<dt>Alpha and Omega in that fair tablet
<dt>Wherein is drawn the angels' alphabet,
<dt>Jesus. If he were learnt, need more be known?
<p>
<a name=208></a><h2>"O wretched man, the knot of contraries"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O wretched man, the knot of contraries,
<dt>In whom both heaven and earth doth move and rest,
<dt>Heaven of my mind, which with Christ's love is blest,
<dt>Death of my heart, which in dull languor lies!
<dt>Yet doth my moving will still circulize
<dt>My heaven about my earth with thoughts' unrest,
<dt>Where reason as a sun from east to west
<dt>Darteth his shining beams to melt this ice.
<dt>And now with fear it southward doth descend,
<dt>Now between both is equinoctial,
<dt>And now to joys it higher doth ascend,
<dt>And yet continues my sea glacial.
<dt>What shall I do, but pray to Christ the Son?
<dt>In earth as heaven, Lord, let thy will be done.
