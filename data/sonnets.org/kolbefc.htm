<a name=010></a><h2>A Sonnet on the Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A sonnet is the body of a thought
<dt>Which enters suddenly into the poet's mind
<dt>And breathes its way mysterious as the wind,
<dt>Unrecognised, as first it was unsought.
<dt>Whilst yet unformed, 'tis kindred to the Naught
<dt>Whence it arose: the poet still must find
<dt>Some spirit-worthy shape in which to bind
<dt>The subtle life wherewith his mind is fraught.
<p>
<dt>A stanza from the mental deep,
<dt>Rhymes well-disposed with rhythm of even flow;
<dt>Full use of sense, due length of limb it gives,
<dt>A body fit. The thought, aroused from sleep,
<dt>Flushes the rhythm with a poetic glow,
<dt>And in the sonnet's form for ever lives.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>"Out of the Strong came forth Sweetness"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Great Table Mountain, which I daily scan
<dt>With still increasing joy, this morn was framed
<dt>In a low rainbow Ph&oelig;bus rightly aimed
<dt>Just to include the outline in its span.
<dt>And surely never since the world began
<dt>Was Nature's ruggedness more sweetly tamed.
<dt>Yet through my heart a sudden terror flamed;
<dt>Heaven's smile more dread inspires than earthly ban.
<p>
<dt>Such is the alchemy of sun and rain:
<dt>Touching earth's choicest dream of loveliness,
<dt>It turned life's daily pleasure into awe.
<dt>And pray what meant it? Nay, I cannot guess:
<dt>But all that is within me--soul, heart, brain--
<dt>Was dumbly glorified by what I saw.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>A Rainbow at Victoria Falls</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A child, I chased the rainbow once, and wept
<dt>Because I could not reach its glorious ray.
<dt>In life's decline I stood amid the spray
<dt>Where all Zambesi down its gorges leapt;
<dt>And as into the cloud I careless stept,
<dt>The rainbow forward moving came my way.
<dt>With round completed on the grass it lay.
<dt>And o'er my feet the rosy radiance crept.
<dt>So do we chase our fancies, and despair
<dt>At length of joys that made our youth so sweet;
<dt>Till, some day, God's ideal, now unsought,
<dt>Bodies itself in some diviner air,
<dt>And filling with its radiance all our thought,
<dt>Completes its circle at our very feet.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Humility and Fruit</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Only upon its tendrils blooms the vine--
<dt>Those tendrils by whose aid it soars aloft
<dt>And lifts its bannered leafage, broad and soft,
<dt>Above the stronger elm. Its gold shoots twine
<dt>High up in the air in sweet mock-martial line
<dt>As if its strength were all its own. Yet doff'd
<dt>Of these its tendrils, prone upon the croft
<dt>In barren weakness must it soon recline.
<p>
<dt>Only the tendril blooms; only the flower
<dt>Gives fruit; and only for the fruit it brings
<dt>Does the vine live. The Christian soul likewise
<dt>Only in humble clinging finds its power;
<dt>And like the Master's Vine, piercing the skies,
<dt>Bears fruit in that alone whereby it clings.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Love's Violence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When first he came, angels 'mid heavenly glow,
<dt>By sweet compulsion drawn to earth to sing,
<dt>Made the clear welkin with their Gloria ring.
<dt>Men wondering asked, "Why sing ye here below?"
<p>
<dt>When from the mount they saw him upward go,
<dt>His glad disciples stood a-marvelling,
<dt>As if their souls they after him would fling,
<dt>Angels in wonder asked, "Why gaze ye so?"
<p>
<dt>Thus near His presence both in wonder are;
<dt>But once we see our God, the mystery ends.
<dt>Where the sun rises, there must be the morn.
<dt>Where the Babe smiles, or where our King ascends, 
<dt>Thither all hearts are violently borne
<dt>And, captive, follow Love's triumphal car.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Veni, Creator</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Creator Spirit, Lord of life and light,
<dt>Under Thy brooding care the world began.
<dt>Through Thee the elements together ran
<dt>And built up order from the void of night.
<dt>Through Thee life, darkling, struggled into sight;
<dt>Then, adding power to power, placed in the van
<dt>A being, soul-endowed, Thy creature man,
<dt>Lifted by Thee beyond all earthly height.
<p>
<dt>O Love, who through this elemental strife
<dt>Didst bring a universe to such increase,
<dt>Brood o'er the chaos of my sin-fraught soul.
<dt>Let there be light in me: let order, life,
<dt>Reason and grace resume their sway, and peace
<dt>Subdue my little world from pole to pole.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>A Conversion</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Behold that dark brown chrysalis, seeming dead--
<dt>Can such things live? Will life's reviving might
<dt>Arouse this sleeper from so dark a night?
<dt>Yes, see!--there issues from it[s] tomb-like bed
<dt>A creature from whose airy wings are shed
<dt>Bright beams of living, many-coloured light.
<dt>Thus have I seen a spirit take its flight.
<dt>Over its wings had error's meshes spread
<dt>The bonds of lie and prejudice and hell:
<dt>And the beholder in an underbreath
<dt>Sighed sadly as he whispered, "This is death!"
<dt>But no--a power thrills through the lifeless shell;
<dt>And into glorious morn the spirit springs,
<dt>The light of heaven gleaming from its wings.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>"How shall this be done?"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Heaven's balance was all trembling when it eyed
<dt>Mary, unwonted trouble on her brow,
<dt>Confronting God with an imperial "How?"
<dt>For once, this once, Heaven hoped to be denied,
<dt>Nor hoped in vain. To be no earthly bride
<dt>Was always Mary's gift to Heaven; and now,
<dt>Strong in the splendour of her virgin vow,
<dt>She waives the Motherhood of God aside.
<dt>O queenly spirit! O Heart Immaculate!
<dt>This world contained no measure of thy worth.
<dt>All other souls with inward strife are torn;
<dt>Thou wert so heavenly, thy royal state
<dt>So towered supreme above the dross of earth,
<dt>That even thy temptations were heaven-born.
