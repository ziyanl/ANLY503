<p>
<dt>Although she feeds me bread of bitterness, 
<dt>And sinks into my throat her tiger's tooth, 
<dt>Stealing my breath of life, I will confess 
<dt>I love this cultured hell that tests my youth! 
<dt>Her vigor flows like tides into my blood, 
<dt>Giving me strength erect against her hate. 
<dt>Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood. 
<dt>Yet as a rebel fronts a king in state, 
<dt>I stand within her walls with not a shred 
<dt>Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer. 
<dt>Darkly I gaze into the days ahead, 
<dt>And see her might and granite wonders there, 
<dt>Beneath the touch of Time's unerring hand, 
<dt>Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand. 
<p>
<a name="020"></a><h2>Wild May</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Aleta mentions in her tender letters, 
<dt>Among a chain of quaint and touching things, 
<dt>That you are feeble, weighted down with fetters, 
<dt>And given to strange deeds and mutterings. 
<dt>No longer without trace or thought of fear, 
<dt>Do you leap to and ride the rebel roan; 
<dt>But have become the victim of grim care, 
<dt>With three brown beauties to support alone. 
<dt>But none the less will you be in my mind, 
<dt>Wild May that cantered by the risky ways, 
<dt>With showy head-cloth flirting in the wind, 
<dt>From market in the glad December days; 
<dt>Wild May of whom even other girls could rave 
<dt>Before sex tamed your spirit, made you slave. 
<p>
<a name="030"></a><h2>In Bondage</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>I would be wandering in distant fields 
<dt>Where man, and bird, and beast, lives leisurely, 
<dt>And the old earth is kind, and ever yields 
<dt>Her goodly gifts to all her children free; 
<dt>Where life is fairer, lighter, less demanding, 
<dt>And boys and girls have time and space for play 
<dt>Before they come to years of understanding-- 
<dt>Somewhere I would be singing, far away. 
<dt>For life is greater than the thousand wars 
<dt>Men wage for it in their insatiate lust, 
<dt>And will remain like the eternal stars, 
<dt>When all that shines to-day is drift and dust 
<dt>But I am bound with you in your mean graves, 
<dt>O black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves. 
<p>
<a name="040"></a><h2>Enslaved</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Oh when I think of my long-suffering race, 
<dt>For weary centuries despised, oppressed, 
<dt>Enslaved and lynched, denied a human place 
<dt>In the great life line of the Christian West; 
<dt>And in the Black Land disinherited, 
<dt>Robbed in the ancient country of its birth, 
<dt>My heart grows sick with hate, becomes as lead, 
<dt>For this my race that has no home on earth. 
<dt>Then from the dark depths of my soul I cry 
<dt>To the avenging angel to consume 
<dt>The white man's world of wonders utterly: 
<dt>Let it be swallowed up in earth's vast womb, 
<dt>Or upward roll as sacrificial smoke 
<dt>To liberate my people from its yoke! 
<p>
<a name="050"></a><h2>I Shall Return</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>I shall return again; I shall return 
<dt>To laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes 
<dt>At golden noon the forest fires burn, 
<dt>Wafting their blue-black smoke to sapphire skies. 
<dt>I shall return to loiter by the streams 
<dt>That bathe the brown blades of the bending grasses, 
<dt>And realize once more my thousand dreams 
<dt>Of waters rushing down the mountain passes. 
<dt>I shall return to hear the fiddle and fife 
<dt>Of village dances, dear delicious tunes 
<dt>That stir the hidden depths of native life, 
<dt>Stray melodies of dim remembered runes. 
<dt>I shall return, I shall return again, 
<dt>To ease my mind of long, long years of pain. 
<p>
<a name="060"></a><h2>My Mother</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<h3>I</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Reg wished me to go with him to the field, 
<dt>I paused because I did not want to go; 
<dt>But in her quiet way she made me yield 
<dt>Reluctantly, for she was breathing low. 
<dt>Her hand she slowly lifted from her lap 
<dt>And, smiling sadly in the old sweet way, 
<dt>She pointed to the nail where hung my cap. 
<dt>Her eyes said: I shall last another day. 
<dt>But scarcely had we reached the distant place, 
<dt>When o'er the hills we heard a faint bell ringing; 
<dt>A boy came running up with frightened face; 
<dt>We knew the fatal news that he was bringing. 
<dt>I heard him listlessly, without a moan, 
<dt>Although the only one I loved was gone. 
<p>
<a name="070"></a><h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>The dawn departs, the morning is begun, 
<dt>The trades come whispering from off the seas, 
<dt>The fields of corn are golden in the sun, 
<dt>The dark-brown tassels fluttering in the breeze; 
<dt>The bell is sounding and the children pass, 
<dt>Frog-leaping, skipping, shouting, laughing shrill, 
<dt>Down the red road, over the pasture-grass, 
<dt>Up to the school-house crumbling on the hill. 
<dt>The older folk are at their peaceful toil, 
<dt>Some pulling up the weeds, some plucking corn, 
<dt>And others breaking up the sun-baked soil. 
<dt>Float, faintly-scented breeze, at early morn 
<dt>Over the earth where mortals sow and reap-- 
<dt>Beneath its breast my mother lies asleep. 
<p>
<a name="080"></a><h2>Africa</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>The sun sought thy dim bed and brought forth light, 
<dt>The sciences were sucklings at thy breast; 
<dt>When all the world was young in pregnant night 
<dt>Thy slaves toiled at thy monumental best. 
<dt>Thou ancient treasure-land, thou modern prize, 
<dt>New peoples marvel at thy pyramids! 
<dt>The years roll on, thy sphinx of riddle eyes 
<dt>Watches the mad world with immobile lids. 
<dt>The Hebrews humbled them at Pharaoh's name. 
<dt>Cradle of Power! Yet all things were in vain! 
<dt>Honor and Glory, Arrogance and Fame! 
<dt>They went. The darkness swallowed thee again. 
<dt>Thou art the harlot, now thy time is done, 
<dt>Of all the mighty nations of the sun. 
<p>
<a name="090"></a><h2>On A Primitive Canoe</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Here, passing lonely down this quiet lane, 
<dt>Before a mud-splashed window long I pause 
<dt>To gaze and gaze, while through my active brain 
<dt>Still thoughts are stirred to wakefulness; because 
<dt>Long, long ago in a dim unknown land, 
<dt>A massive forest-tree, ax-felled, adze-hewn, 
<dt>Was deftly done by cunning mortal hand 
<dt>Into a symbol of the tender moon. 
<dt>Why does it thrill more than the handsome boat 
<dt>That bore me o'er the wild Atlantic ways, 
<dt>And fill me with rare sense of things remote 
<dt>From this harsh land of fretful nights and days? 
<dt>I cannot answer but, whate'er it be, 
<dt>An old wine has intoxicated me. 
<p>
<a name="100"></a><h2>To Winter</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Stay, season of calm love and soulful snows! 
<dt>There is a subtle sweetness in the sun, 
<dt>The ripples on the stream's breast gaily run, 
<dt>The wind more boisterously by me blows, 
<dt>And each succeeding day now longer grows. 
<dt>The birds a gladder music have begun, 
<dt>The squirrel, full of mischief and of fun, 
<dt>From maples' topmost branch the brown twig throws. 
<dt>I read these pregnant signs, know what they mean: 
<dt>I know that thou art making ready to go. 
<dt>Oh stay! I fled a land where fields are green 
<dt>Always, and palms wave gently to and fro, 
<dt>And winds are balmy, blue brooks ever sheen, 
<dt>To ease my heart of its impassioned woe. 
<p>
<a name="110"></a><h2>On The Road</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Roar of the rushing train fearfully rocking, 
<dt>Impatient people jammed in line for food, 
<dt>The rasping noise of cars together knocking, 
<dt>And worried waiters, some in ugly mood, 
<dt>Crowding into the choking pantry hole 
<dt>To call out dishes for each angry glutton 
<dt>Exasperated grown beyond control, 
<dt>From waiting for his soup or fish or mutton. 
<dt>At last the station's reached, the engine stops; 
<dt>For bags and wraps the red-caps circle round; 
<dt>From off the step the passenger lightly hops, 
<dt>And seeks his cab or tram-car homeward bound; 
<dt>The waiters pass out weary, listless, glum, 
<dt>To spend their tips on harlots, cards and rum. 
<p>
<a name="120"></a><h2>The Harlem Dancer </h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes 
<dt>And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway; 
<dt>Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes 
<dt>Blown by black players upon a picnic day. 
<dt>She sang and danced on gracefully and calm, 
<dt>The light gauze hanging loose about her form; 
<dt>To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm 
<dt>Grown lovelier for passing through a storm. 
<dt>Upon her swarthy neck black shiny curls 
<dt>Luxuriant fell; and tossing coins in praise, 
<dt>The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls, 
<dt>Devoured her shape with eager, passionate gaze; 
<dt>But looking at her falsely-smiling face, 
<dt>I knew her self was not in that strange place. 
<p>
<a name="130"></a><h2>Dawn in New York</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>The Dawn! The Dawn! The crimson-tinted, comes 
<dt>Out of the low still skies, over the hills, 
<dt>Manhattan's roofs and spires and cheerless domes! 
<dt>The Dawn! My spirit to its spirit thrills. 
<dt>Almost the mighty city is asleep, 
<dt>No pushing crowd, no tramping, tramping feet. 
<dt>But here and there a few cars groaning creep 
<dt>Along, above, and underneath the street, 
<dt>Bearing their strangely-ghostly burdens by, 
<dt>The women and the men of garish nights, 
<dt>Their eyes wine-weakened and their clothes awry, 
<dt>Grotesques beneath the strong electric lights. 
<dt>The shadows wane. The Dawn comes to New York. 
<dt>And I go darkly-rebel to my work. 
<p>
<a name="140"></a><h2>The Tired Worker</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>O whisper, O my soul! The afternoon 
<dt>Is waning into evening, whisper soft! 
<dt>Peace, O my rebel heart! for soon the moon 
<dt>From out its misty veil will swing aloft! 
<dt>Be patient, weary body, soon the night 
<dt>Will wrap thee gently in her sable sheet, 
<dt>And with a leaden sigh thou wilt invite 
<dt>To rest thy tired hands and aching feet. 
<dt>The wretched day was theirs, the night is mine; 
<dt>Come tender sleep, and fold me to thy breast. 
<dt>But what steals out the gray clouds like red wine? 
<dt>O dawn! O dreaded dawn! O let me rest 
<dt>Weary my veins, my brain, my life! Have pity! 
<dt>No! Once again the harsh, the ugly city. 
<p>
<a name="150"></a><h2>Outcast</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>For the dim regions whence my fathers came 
<dt>My spirit, bondaged by the body, longs. 
<dt>Words felt, but never heard, my lips would frame; 
<dt>My soul would sing forgotten jungle songs. 
<dt>I would go back to darkness and to peace, 
<dt>But the great western world holds me in fee, 
<dt>And I may never hope for full release 
<dt>While to its alien gods I bend my knee. 
<dt>Something in me is lost, forever lost, 
<dt>Some vital thing has gone out of my heart, 
<dt>And I must walk the way of life a ghost 
<dt>Among the sons of earth, a thing apart; 
<dt>For I was born, far from my native clime, 
<dt>Under the white man's menace, out of time. 
<p>
<a name="160"></a><h2>I Know My Soul</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>I plucked my soul out of its secret place, 
<dt>And held it to the mirror of my eye, 
<dt>To see it like a star against the sky, 
<dt>A twitching body quivering in space, 
<dt>A spark of passion shining on my face. 
<dt>And I explored it to determine why 
<dt>This awful key to my infinity 
<dt>Conspires to rob me of sweet joy and grace. 
<dt>And if the sign may not be fully read, 
<dt>If I can comprehend but not control, 
<dt>I need not gloom my days with futile dread, 
<dt>Because I see a part and not the whole. 
<dt>Contemplating the strange, I'm comforted 
<dt>By this narcotic thought: I know my soul. 
<p>
<a name="170"></a><h2>Birds of Prey</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Their shadow dims the sunshine of our day, 
<dt>As they go lumbering across the sky, 
<dt>Squawking in joy of feeling safe on high, 
<dt>Beating their heavy wings of owlish gray. 
<dt>They scare the singing birds of earth away 
<dt>As, greed-impelled, they circle threateningly, 
<dt>Watching the toilers with malignant eye, 
<dt>From their exclusive haven--birds of prey. 
<dt>They swoop down for the spoil in certain might, 
<dt>And fasten in our bleeding flesh their claws. 
<dt>They beat us to surrender weak with fright, 
<dt>And tugging and tearing without let or pause, 
<dt>They flap their hideous wings in grim delight, 
<dt>And stuff our gory hearts into their maws. 
<p>
<a name="180"></a><h2>The Castaways</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>The vivid grass with visible delight 
<dt>Springing triumphant from the pregnant earth, 
<dt>The butterflies, and sparrows in brief flight 
<dt>Chirping and dancing for the season's birth, 
<dt>The dandelions and rare daffodils 
<dt>That touch the deep-stirred heart with hands of gold, 
<dt>The thrushes sending forth their joyous trills,-- 
<dt>Not these, not these did I at first behold! 
<dt>But seated on the benches daubed with green, 
<dt>The castaways of life, a few asleep, 
<dt>Some withered women desolate and mean, 
<dt>And over all, life's shadows dark and deep. 
<dt>Moaning I turned away, for misery 
<dt>I have the strength to bear but not to see. 
<p>
<a name="190"></a><h2>The Lynching</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>His Spirit in smoke ascended to high heaven. 
<dt>His father, by the cruelest way of pain, 
<dt>Had bidden him to his bosom once again; 
<dt>The awful sin remained still unforgiven. 
<dt>All night a bright and solitary star 
<dt>(Perchance the one that ever guided him, 
<dt>Yet gave him up at last to Fate's wild whim) 
<dt>Hung pitifully o'er the swinging char. 
<dt>Day dawned, and soon the mixed crowds came to view 
<dt>The ghastly body swaying in the sun 
<dt>The women thronged to look, but never a one 
<dt>Showed sorrow in her eyes of steely blue; 
<dt>And little lads, lynchers that were to be, 
<dt>Danced round the dreadful thing in fiendish glee. 
<p>
<a name="200"></a><h2>Baptism</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Into the furnace let me go alone; 
<dt>Stay you without in terror of the heat. 
<dt>I will go naked in--for thus 'tis sweet-- 
<dt>Into the weird depths of the hottest zone. 
<dt>I will not quiver in the frailest bone, 
<dt>You will not note a flicker of defeat; 
<dt>My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet, 
<dt>My mouth give utterance to any moan. 
<dt>The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears; 
<dt>Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name. 
<dt>Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears, 
<dt>Transforming me into a shape of flame. 
<dt>I will come out, back to your world of tears, 
<dt>A stronger soul within a finer frame. 
<p>
<a name="210"></a><h2>If We Must Die</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>If we must die, let it not be like hogs 
<dt>Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot, 
<dt>While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs, 
<dt>Making their mock at our accursed lot. 
<dt>If we must die, O let us nobly die, 
<dt>So that our precious blood may not be shed 
<dt>In vain; then even the monsters we defy 
<dt>Shall be constrained to honor us though dead! 
<dt>O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe! 
<dt>Though far outnumbered let us show us brave, 
<dt>And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow! 
<dt>What though before us lies the open grave? 
<dt>Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack, 
<dt>Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back! 
<p>
<a name="220"></a><h2>The Night Fire</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>No engines shrieking rescue storm the night, 
<dt>And hose and hydrant cannot here avail; 
<dt>The flames laugh high and fling their challenging light, 
<dt>And clouds turn gray and black from silver-pale. 
<dt>The fire leaps out and licks the ancient walls, 
<dt>And the big building bends and twists and groans. 
<dt>A bar drops from its place; a rafter falls 
<dt>Burning the flowers. The wind in frenzy moans. 
<dt>The watchers gaze, held wondering by the fire, 
<dt>The dwellers cry their sorrow to the crowd, 
<dt>The flames beyond themselves rise higher, higher, 
<dt>To lose their glory in the frowning cloud, 
<dt>Yielding at length the last reluctant breath. 
<dt>And where life lay asleep broods darkly death. 
<p>
<a name="230"></a><h2>Poetry</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Sometimes I tremble like a storm-swept flower, 
<dt>And seek to hide my tortured soul from thee. 
<dt>Bowing my head in deep humility 
<dt>Before the silent thunder of thy power. 
<dt>Sometimes I flee before thy blazing light, 
<dt>As from the specter of pursuing death; 
<dt>Intimidated lest thy mighty breath, 
<dt>Windways, will sweep me into utter night. 
<dt>For oh, I fear they will be swallowed up-- 
<dt>The loves which are to me of vital worth, 
<dt>My passion and my pleasure in the earth-- 
<dt>And lost forever in thy magic cup! 
<dt>I fear, I fear my truly human heart 
<dt>Will perish on the altar-stone of art! 
<p>
<a name="240"></a><h2>The Snow Fairy</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<h3>I</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Throughout the afternoon I watched them there, 
<dt>Snow-fairies falling, falling from the sky, 
<dt>Whirling fantastic in the misty air, 
<dt>Contending fierce for space supremacy. 
<dt>And they flew down a mightier force at night, 
<dt>As though in heaven there was revolt and riot, 
<dt>And they, frail things had taken panic flight 
<dt>Down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet. 
<dt>I went to bed and rose at early dawn 
<dt>To see them huddled together in a heap, 
<dt>Each merged into the other upon the lawn, 
<dt>Worn out by the sharp struggle, fast asleep. 
<dt>The sun shone brightly on them half the day, 
<dt>By night they stealthily had stol'n away. 
<p>
<a name="250"></a><h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>And suddenly my thoughts then turned to you 
<dt>Who came to me upon a winter's night, 
<dt>When snow-sprites round my attic window flew, 
<dt>Your hair disheveled, eyes aglow with light. 
<dt>My heart was like the weather when you came, 
<dt>The wanton winds were blowing loud and long; 
<dt>But you, with joy and passion all aflame, 
<dt>You danced and sang a lilting summer song. 
<dt>I made room for you in my little bed, 
<dt>Took covers from the closet fresh and warm, 
<dt>A downful pillow for your scented head, 
<dt>And lay down with you resting in my arm. 
<dt>You went with Dawn. You left me ere the day, 
<dt>The lonely actor of a dreamy play. 
<p>
<a name="260"></a><h2>La Paloma In London</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>About Soho we went before the light; 
<dt>We went, unresting six, craving new fun, 
<dt>New scenes, new raptures, for the fevered night 
<dt>Of rollicking laughter, drink and song, was done. 
<dt>The vault was void, but for the dawn's great star 
<dt>That shed upon our path its silver flame, 
<dt>When La Paloma on a low guitar 
<dt>Abruptly from a darkened casement came-- 
<dt>Harlem! All else shut out, I saw the hall, 
<dt>And you in your red shoulder sash come dancing 
<dt>With Val against me languid by the wall, 
<dt>Your burning coffee-colored eyes keen glancing 
<dt>Aslant at mine, proud in your golden glory! 
<dt>I loved you, Cuban girl, fond sweet Diory. 
<p>
<a name="270"></a><h2>One Year After</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<h3>I</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Not once in all our days of poignant love, 
<dt>Did I a single instant give to thee 
<dt>My undivided being wholly free. 
<dt>Not all thy potent passion could remove 
<dt>The barrier that loomed between to prove 
<dt>The full supreme surrendering of me. 
<dt>Oh, I was beaten, helpless utterly 
<dt>Against the shadow-fact with which I strove. 
<dt>For when a cruel power forced me to face 
<dt>The truth which poisoned our illicit wine, 
<dt>That even I was faithless to my race 
<dt>Bleeding beneath the iron hand of thine, 
<dt>Our union seemed a monstrous thing and base! 
<dt>I was an outcast from thy world and mine. 
<p>
<a name="280"></a><h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>Adventure-seasoned and storm-buffeted, 
<dt>I shun all signs of anchorage, because 
<dt>The zest of life exceeds the bound of laws. 
<dt>New gales of tropic fury round my head 
<dt>Break lashing me through hours of soulful dread; 
<dt>But when the terror thins and, spent, withdraws, 
<dt>Leaving me wondering awhile, I pause-- 
<dt>But soon again the risky ways I tread! 
<dt>No rigid road for me, no peace, no rest, 
<dt>While molten elements run through my blood; 
<dt>And beauty-burning bodies manifest 
<dt>Their warm, heart-melting motions to be wooed; 
<dt>And passion boldly rising in my breast, 
<dt>Like rivers of the Spring, lets loose its flood. 
<p>
<a name="290"></a><h2>Thirst</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>My spirit wails for water, water now! 
<dt>My tongue is aching dry, my throat is hot 
<dt>For water, fresh rain shaken from a bough, 
<dt>Or dawn dews heavy in some leafy spot. 
<dt>My hungry body's burning for a swim 
<dt>In sunlit water where the air is cool, 
<dt>As in Trout Valley where upon a limb 
<dt>The golden finch sings sweetly to the pool. 
<dt>Oh water, water, when the night is done, 
<dt>When day steals gray-white through the windowpane, 
<dt>Clear silver water when I wake, alone, 
<dt>All impotent of parts, of fevered brain; 
<dt>Pure water from a forest fountain first, 
<dt>To wash me, cleanse me, and to quench my thirst! 
<p>
<a name="300"></a><h2>Futility</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<p></p>
<dt>Oh, I have tried to laugh the pain away, 
<dt>Let new flames brush my love-springs like a feather. 
<dt>But the old fever seizes me to-day, 
<dt>As sickness grips a soul in wretched weather. 
<dt>I have given up myself to every urge, 
<dt>With not a care of precious powers spent, 
<dt>Have bared my body to the strangest scourge, 
<dt>To soothe and deaden my heart's unhealing rent. 
<dt>But you have torn a nerve out of my frame, 
<dt>A gut that no physician can replace, 
<dt>And reft my life of happiness and aim. 
<dt>Oh what new purpose shall I now embrace? 
<dt>What substance hold, what lovely form pursue, 
<dt>When my thought burns through everything to you? 
<p>
<a name="310"></a><h2>Through Agony</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a> 
<h3>I</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>All night, through the eternity of night, 
<dt>Pain was my potion though I could not feel. 
<dt>Deep in my humbled heart you ground your heel, 
<dt>Till I was reft of even my inner light, 
<dt>Till reason from my mind had taken flight, 
<dt>And all my world went whirling in a reel. 
<dt>And all my swarthy strength turned cold like steel, 
<dt>A passive mass beneath your puny might. 
<dt>Last night I gave you triumph over me, 
<dt>So I should be myself as once before, 
<dt>I marveled at your shallow mystery, 
<dt>And haunted hungrily your temple door. 
<dt>I gave you sum and substance to be free, 
<dt>Oh, you shall never triumph any more! 
<p>
<a name="320"></a><h3>II</h3>
<p></p>
<dt>I do not fear to face the fact and say, 
<dt>How darkly-dull my living hours have grown, 
<dt>My wounded heart sinks heavier than stone, 
<dt>Because I loved you longer than a day! 
<dt>I do not shame to turn myself away 
<dt>From beckoning flowers beautifully blown, 
<dt>To mourn your vivid memory alone 
<dt>In mountain fastnesses austerely gray. 
<dt>The mists will shroud me on the utter height, 
<dt>The salty, brimming waters of my breast 
<dt>Will mingle with the fresh dews of the night 
<dt>To bathe my spirit hankering to rest. 
<dt>But after sleep I'll wake with greater might, 
<dt>Once more to venture on the eternal quest.</dt>
