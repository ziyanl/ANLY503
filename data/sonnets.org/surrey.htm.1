<a name="101"></a><h2>The <a href="#999">Soote</a> Season</h2>
<p>
<dt>The <a href="#999">soote</a> season, that bud and bloom forth brings,
<dt>With green hath clad the hill and <a href="#999">eke</a> the vale;
<dt>The nightingale with feathers new she sings;
<dt>The <a href="#999">turtle</a> to her <a href="#999">make</a> hath told her tale.
<dt>Summer is come, for every spray now springs,
<dt>The hart hath hung his old head on the pale;
<dt>The buck in <a href="#999">brake</a> his winter coat he flings;
<dt>The fishes <a href="#999">flete</a> with new repaired scale;
<dt>The adder all her slough away she slings;
<dt>The swift swallow pursueth the flyes smale;
<dt>The busy bee her honey now she <a href="#999">mings</a>,
<dt>Winter is worn that was the flowers' bale.
<dt>And thus I see among these pleasant things
<dt>Each care decays, and yet my sorrow springs.
<p>

<a name="102"></a><h2>"Love that doth reign and live within my thought"</h2>
<p></p>
<dt>Love that doth reign and live within my thought
<dt>And built his seat within my captive breast,
<dt>Clad in arms wherein with me he fought,
<dt>Oft in my face he doth his banner rest.
<dt>But she that taught me love and suffer pain,
<dt>My doubtful hope and eke my hot desire
<dt>With shamefaced look to shadow and refrain,
<dt>Her smiling grace converteth straight to ire.
<dt>And coward Love, then, to the heart apace
<dt>Taketh his flight, where he doth lurk and 'plain,
<dt>His purpose lost, and dare not show his face.
<dt>For my lord's guilt thus faultless bide I pain,
<dt>Yet from my lord shall not my foot remove,--
<dt>Sweet is the death that taketh end by love.
<p><i>Note: The sonnet above is translated from Petrarch. Compare with Wyatt's sonnet <a href="wyatt.htm#002">"The long love that in my heart doth harbor..."</a> or with a <a href="petrarch.htm">literal translation from the Italian</a>.</i></p>

<a name="103"></a><h2>"Set me whereas the sun doth parch the green..."</h2>
<p></p>
<dt>Set me whereas the sun doth parch the green
<dt>Or where his beams do not dissolve the ice,
<dt>In temperate heat where he is felt and seen;
<dt>In presence prest of people, mad or wise;
<dt>Set me in high or yet in low degree,
<dt>In longest night or in the shortest day,
<dt>In clearest sky or where clouds thickest be,
<dt>In lusty youth or when my hairs are gray.
<dt>Set me in heaven, in earth, or else in hell;
<dt>In hill, or dale, or in the foaming flood;
<dt>Thrall or at large, alive whereso I dwell,
<dt>Sick or in health, in evil fame or good:
<dt>Hers will I be, and only with this thought
<dt>Content myself although my chance be nought.
