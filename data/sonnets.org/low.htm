<p>"Samuel Low is the author of a collection of poems, in two volumes, published in New York in 1800. In that collection are twenty-two sonnets, Shakespearean and irregular, of a sentimental or reflective nature. The two reprinted here are thoroughly representative of his work."

<p>
<dt>Though not the gaudy Tulip's drap'ry fine,
<dt>Yet thou, fair plant, canst Tyre's rich purple boast;
<dt>The beauty of the amethyst is thine;
<dt>Thy neat and simple garb delights me most;
<dt>Unseen and shadowy forms of tiny size,
<dt>Delicious dew-drops from thy surface sip,
<dt>Feast on thy charms their microscopic eyes,
<dt>And breathe thy sweets, as o'er thy leaves they trip.
<dt>Emblem of innocence and modest worth,
<dt>Who lov'st the eye of rude remark to shun,
<dt>Whose lovely, lowly form still tends to earth.
<dt>Unlike the flower which courts the mid-day sun;
<dt>Thou seem'st sweet flow'ret, of his beam afraid;--
<dt>Thus merit ever loves and seeks the shade.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>To the Genius of Poetry</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Genius of tuneful verse! inspired by whom,
<dt>Divine Maeonides in numbers first
<dt>Dawn'd on a world o'ercast with mental gloom,
<dt>And strains sublime to barb'rous Greece rehearsed;
<dt>Spirit of song! from whose Castilian fount
<dt>The Mantuan poet sweet instruction drew;
<dt>With piercing ken to whose Aonian mount,
<dt>Once Albion's bards on eagle pinions flew;
<dt>Though far aloof thy vot'ry stretch his wing,
<dt>That o'er no classic land presumes to soar,
<dt>Him hast thou taught in plaintive strains to sing,
<dt>To feel thy solace, and thy power adore;
<dt>And, spite of envy's futile venom, thou
<dt>Hast placed a leaf of laurel on his brow.
