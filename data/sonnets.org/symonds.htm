<p>
<dt>The Sonnet is a world, where feelings caught
<dt>In webs of phantasy, combine and fuse
<dt>Their kindred elements 'neath mystic dews
<dt>Shed from the ether round man's dwelling wrought;
<dt>Distilling heart's content, star-fragrance fraught
<dt>With influences from the breathing fires
<dt>Of heaven in everlasting endless gyres
<dt>Ending and encircling orbs of thought.
<dt>Our Sonnet's world hath two fix'd hemispheres:
<dt>This, where the sun with fierce strength masculine
<dt>Pours his keen rays and bids the noonday shine;
<dt>That, where the moon and the stars, concordant powers,
<dt>Shed milder rays, and daylight disappears
<dt>In low melodious music of still hours.

<p>
<dt>Nay, Death, thou art a shadow! Even as light
<dt>Is but the shadow of invisible God,
<dt>And of that shade the shadow is thin Night,
<dt>Veiling the earth whereon our feet have trod;
<dt>So art Thou but the shadow of this life,
<dt>Itself the pale and unsubstantial shade
<dt>Of living God, fulfill'd by love and strife
<dt>Throughout the universe Himself hath made:
<dt>And as frail Night, following the flight of earth,
<dt>Obscures the world we breathe in, for a while,
<dt>So Thou, the reflex of our mortal birth,
<dt>Veilest the life wherein we weep and smile:
<dt>But when both earth and life are whirl'd away,
<dt>What shade can shroud us from God's deathess day?
</p>

<p>
<dt>There are who, when the bat on wing transverse
<dt>Skims the swart surface of some neighbouring mere,
<dt>Catch that thin cry too fine for common ear:
<dt>Thus the last joy-note of the universe
<dt>Is borne to those few listners who immerse
<dt>Their intellectual hearing in no clear
<dt>Paean, but pierce it with the thin-edged spear
<dt>Of utmost beauty which contains a curse.
<dt>Dead on their sense fall marches hymeneal,
<dt>Triumphal odes, hymns, symphonies sonorous;
<dt>They crave one shrill vibration, tense, ideal,
<dt>Transcending and surpassing the world's chorus;
<dt>Keen, fine, ethereal, exquisitely real,
<dt>Intangible as star's light quivering o'er us.
<p>
<a name=400></a><h2>The Prism of Life</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>All that began with God, in God must end:
<dt>All lives are garnered in His final bliss:
<dt>All wills hereafter shall be one with His:
<dt>When in the sea we sought, our spirits blend.
<dt>Rays of pure light, which one frail prism may rend
<dt>Into conflicting colours, meet and kiss
<dt>With manifold attraction, yet still miss
<dt>Contentment, while their kindred hues contend.
<dt>Break but that three-edged glass:--inviolate
<dt>The sundered beams resume their primal state,
<dt>Weaving pure light in flawless harmony.
<dt>Thus decomposed, subject to love and strife,
<dt>God's thought, made conscious through man's mortal life,
<dt>Resumes through death the eternal unity.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Lift up your headds, gates of my heart, unfold
<dt>Your portals to salute the King of kings!
<dt>Behold Him come, borne on cherubic wings
<dt>Engrained with crimson eyes and grail of gold!
<dt>Before His path the thunder-clouds withhold
<dt>Their stormy pinions, and the desert sings:
<dt>He from His lips divine and forehead flings
<dt>Sunlight of peace unfathomed, bliss untold.
<dt>O soul, faint soul, disquieted how long!
<dt>Lift up thine eyes, for lo, thy Lord is near,
<dt>Lord of all loveliness and strength and song,
<dt>The Lord who brings heart-sadness better cheer,
<dt>Scattering those midnight dreams that dote on wrong
<dt>Purging with heaven's pure rays love's atmosphere!
