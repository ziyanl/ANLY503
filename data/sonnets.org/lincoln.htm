<p>
<dt>How happy he, who by fine cultured art,
<dt>Plies him a line upon a silvery stream--
<dt>Takes him therefrom a newly ventured theme,
<dt>And fair to speak hath change of mind and heart!
<dt>Whose gentle wrist shall to a fly impart
<dt>Semblance to living--being so, shall seem
<dt>To the brook eyes, nor fancy, nor a dream--
<dt>And so beguile by crafty counterpart!
<p>
<dt>He shall of faith in ample store be given;
<dt>Wedlock to peace--the hand of darling joy,
<dt>Sunshinest mood--the cleansing spirit of heaven,
<dt>And so betimes due gracefulness employ.
<dt>For him the gods shall favor and repay,
<dt>Make life and death, all one, a golden day!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Izaak Walton</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Him did High Virtue perfectly endow,
<dt>Clean-wrought for living--Nature's gifted sage;
<dt>Uncoverer of Beauty on Time's gilded page,
<dt>Fine Priest of streams, of leaf and drooping bough;
<dt>Keeper of gladness, Faith's own solemn vow,--
<dt>Eschewing Gain and Competition's rage,
<dt>Measuring Life by Heaven's wiser gauge,
<dt>And breathing hope and blessedness enow!
<p>
<dt>Oh I have been much in delight to think,
<dt>How well his days were chosen to be spent.
<dt>And by the pools of Stafford, 'proached the brink
<dt>Of Paradise--and comfortably lent,
<dt>Him to sweet Themes of chaste divinity,
<dt>Kind songs of hope on skyward wings set free!
