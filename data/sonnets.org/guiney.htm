<p>
<dt>Ye daffodilian days, whose fallen towers
<dt>Shielded our paradisal prime from ill,
<dt>Fair Past, fair motherhood! let come what will,
<dt>We, being yours, defy the anarch powers.
<dt>For us the happy tidings fell, in showers
<dt>Enjewelling the wind from every hill;
<dt>We drained the sun against the winter's chill;
<dt>Our ways were barricadoed in with flowers:
<p>
<dt>And if from skyey minsters now unhoused,
<dt>Earth's massy workings at the forge we hear,
<dt>The black roll of the congregated sea,
<dt>And war's live hoof: O yet, last year, last year
<dt>We were the lark-lulled shepherdlings, that drowsed
<dt>Grave-deep, at noon, in grass of Arcady!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Among the Flags</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3><i>In Doric Hall, Massachussetts State House</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>Dear witnesses, all-luminous, eloquent,
<dt>Stacked thickly on the tessellated floor!
<dt>The soldier-blood stirs in me, as of yore
<dt>In sire and grandsire who to battle went:
<dt>I seem to know the shaded valley tent,
<dt>The armed and bearded men, the thrill of war,
<dt>Horses that prance to hear the cannon roar,
<dt>Shrill bugle-calls, and camp-fire merriment.
<p>
<dt>And as fair symbols of heroic things,
<dt>Not void of tears mine eyes must e'en behold
<dt>These banners lovelier as the deeper marred:
<dt>A panegyric never writ for kings
<dt>On every tarnished staff and tattered fold;
<dt>And by them, tranquil spirits standing guard.
