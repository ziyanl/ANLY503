<p>
<dt>There dwells a spirit in the budding year--
<dt>As motherhood doth beautify the face--
<dt>That even lends these barren glebes a grace,
<dt>And fills grey hours with beauty that were drear
<dt>And bleak when the loud, storming March was here:
<dt>A glamour that the thrilled heart dimly traces
<dt>In swelling boughs and soft, wet, windy spaces,
<dt>And sunlands where the chattering birds make cheer.
<dt>I thread the uplands where the wind's footfalls
<dt>Stir leaves in gusty hollows, autumn's urns.
<dt>Seaward the river's shining breast expands,
<dt>High in the windy pines a lone crow calls,
<dt>And far below some patient ploughman turns
<dt>His great black furrow over steaming lands.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Already Winter in his sombre round,
<dt>Before his time, hath touched these hills austere
<dt>With lonely flame. Last night, without a sound,
<dt>The ghostly frost walked out by wood and mere.
<dt>And now the sumach curls his frond of fire,
<dt>The aspen-tree reluctant drops his gold,
<dt>And down the gullies the North's wild vibrant lyre
<dt>Rouses the bitter armies of the cold.
<dt>O'er this short afternoon the night draws down,
<dt>With ominous chill, across these regions bleak;
<dt>Wind-beaten gold, the sunset fades around
<dt>The purple loneliness of crag and peak,
<dt>Leaving the world an iron house wherein
<dt>Nor love nor life nor hope hath ever been.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Wind's Royalty</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>This summer day is all one palace rare,
<dt>Builded by architects of life unseen,
<dt>In elfin hours the sun and moon between,
<dt>Up out of quarries of the sea and air,
<dt>And earth's fine essences. Aladdin's were
<dt>But tinsel sheen beside this gloried dream,
<dt>High, sunny-windowed, walled by wood and stream,
<dt>And high, dome-roofed, blue-burnished, beyond compare.
<dt>Here reigns a king, the happiest known on earth,
<dt>That blithesome monarch mortals call the wind,
<dt>Who roves his galleries wide in vagrant mirth,
<dt>His courtier clouds obedient to his mind;
<dt>Or when he sleeps his sentinal stars are still,
<dt>With ethiop guards o'ertopping some grave hill.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Night</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Home of the pure in heart and tranquil mind,
<dt>Temple of love's white silence, holy Night;
<dt>Greater than splendid thought or iron might,
<dt>Thy lofty peace unswept by any wind
<dt>Of human sorrow, leaves all care behind.
<dt>Uplifted to the zenith of thy height,
<dt>My world-worn spirit drinks thy calm delight,
<dt>And, chrysalis-like, lets slip its earthly rind.
<dt>The blinded feuds, base passions, and fierce guilt,
<dt>Vain pride and falseness that enslaved the day,
<dt>Here dwindle and fade with all that mocks and mars;
<dt>Where wisdom, awed, walks hushed with lips that pray.
<dt>'Neath this high minster, dim, invisible, built,
<dt>Vast, walled with deeps of space and roofed with stars.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>"Not unto endless dark..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Not unto endless dark do we go down,
<dt>Though all the wisdom of wide earth said yea,
<dt>Yet my fond heart would throb eternal nay.
<dt>Night, prophet of morning, wears her starry crown,
<dt>And jewels with hope her murkiest shades that frown.
<dt>Death's doubt is kernelled in each prayer we pray.
<dt>Eternity but night in some vast day
<dt>Of God's far-off red flame of love's renown.
<dt>Not unto endless dark. We may not know
<dt>The distant deeps to which our hopings go,
<dt>The tidal shores where ebbs our fleeting breath:
<dt>But over ill and dread and doubt's fell dart,
<dt>Sweet hope, eternal, holds the human heart,
<dt>And love laughs down the desolate dusks of death.

<p>
<dt>We are what nature made us; soon or late,
<dt>Life's art that fadeth passeth slow away,
<dt>With iron eatings of our sordid day,
<dt>Leaving behind those influences, innate,
<dt>Immutable, divine. As round some great,
<dt>Rude, craggy isle, the loud surf's ravening fray
<dt>Shatters all life in spume of thundered spray,
<dt>Leaving huge cliffs, scarred, grim, in naked state.
<p>
<dt>So life and all its idols hath its hour,
<dt>Its fleet, ephemeral dream, its passing show,
<dt>Its pomp of fevered hopes that come and go:
<dt>Then stripped of vanity and folly's power,
<dt>Like some wide water bared to moon and star,
<dt>We know ourselves in truth for what we are.
