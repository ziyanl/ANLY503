<p><h2><i>From <a href="bibliogr.htm#sterner">The Sonnet in American Literature</a></i></h2>
<p>No sonnets by Joseph Rodman Drake are found in <i>The Culprit and Other Poems</i>, which purports to be Drake's complete verse. The sonnet reprinted here is quoted by Duyckinck [Duyckinck: "Cyclopedia of American Literature," Phila., 1881, Vol. I, p. 930] as by Drake, with the note that this and several other poems were not included in the 1835 edition. Thorough search has revealed no earlier source.

<h2>Sonnet</h2>
<p>
<dt>Is thy heart weary of unfeeling men,
<dt>And chilled with the world's ice? Then come with me,
<dt>And I will bring thee to a pleasant glen
<dt>Lovely and lonely. There we'll sit, unviewed
<dt>By scoffing eye; and let our hearts beat free
<dt>With their own mutual throb. For wild and rude
<dt>The access is, and none will there intrude,
<dt>To poison our free thoughts, and mar our solitude!
<dt>Such scenes move not their feelings--for they hold
<dt>No fellowship with nature's loneliness;
<dt>The frozen wave reflects not back the gold
<dt>And crimson flushes of the sunset hour;
<dt>The rock lies cold in sunshine--not the power
<dt>Of heaven's bright orb can clothe its barrenness.
