<p>
<dt>Upon the beach I walked at eve alone
<dt>And listened to the moaning of the sea,
<dt>And watched the sails that in the moonlight shone
<dt>As the horizon. Straightway unto me
<dt>There came a voice, as from below the waves:
<dt>"The less'ning sail will soon be seen no more,
<dt>And as I sweep thy footprints from the shore,
<dt>Time mosses o'er a world of unknown graves.
<dt>And it is well. If men could not forget,
<dt>With phantoms all the world would peopled be;
<dt>The ghosts of buried joys their hearts would fret--
<dt>A flood of tears, like blood, would drown the sea.
<dt>Rail not at Time--the healer of thy woes--
<dt>As of those thou hast forgotten, shall be thy last repose."

<p>
<dt>With eyes suffused and heart dissolved with sorrow,
<dt>How often have I fled the realms of sleep,
<dt>And sought, not vainly, from thy page to borrow
<dt>That which forbids or eye or heart to weep!
<dt>Thy Thanatopsis! fraught with tenderest feeling,
<dt>Is like a June breeze to the ice-bound heart;
<dt>To us, thy humble followers, revealing
<dt>The sage, the seer, the poet that thou art,
<dt>Still roll "The Ages," still "Green River" flows,
<dt>And odorous blossoms load the "Apple Tree,"--
<dt>Into "The Lake" still fall the fleecy snows,
<dt>And Nature everywhere doth speak of thee.
<dt>Oh, for a poet's tongue to name thy name!
<dt>But does it matter? Thine is deathless fame.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Sea</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O Sea, that to these grey and solemn shores
<dt>Dost pour thy plaint through all the circling years;
<dt>I would that to my ever-listening ears
<dt>Some spirit might translate thy language! Roars
<dt>The wave that spends its force against the rocks
<dt>That its assaults deride; a giant's pain
<dt>It voices! Soft dost thou complain
<dt>By pebbly beach to Summer's fields and flocks.
<dt>Tell'st thou of cities hid beneath thy breast?
<dt>Of famed Atlantis, known in story only?
<dt>Of sepulchres innumerable, where rest
<dt>The wrecks of ages, peacefully and lonely?
<dt>Tell why thou plaintest, melancholy sea!
<dt>And the sea answers, Hush, it may not be.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>The Buried Years</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The twilight shadows creep along the wall,
<dt>Without, the sobbing of the wind I hear,
<dt>And from the vine-clad elm that marks the mere
<dt>The ivy leaves in crimson eddies fall.
<dt>Deeper and deeper grow the shades of night,
<dt>And, gazing in the fire, to me appears
<dt>The form of one departed with the years--
<dt>The buried years of hope, and faith and light.
<dt>"Oh that those lips had language"--would they tell
<dt>The old, old story of the bygone days--
<dt>Ere on our heart the blighting shadow fell,
<dt>And we henceforward followed parted ways?
<dt>I ask, but as I ask the embers die--
<dt>The vision fades--and answer none have I.
