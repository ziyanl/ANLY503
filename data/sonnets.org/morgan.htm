<h3>(Founded on a Persian Legend)</h3>
<p>
<dt>The child asks, "Is it true?" The story's old,
<dt>Of a brave youth who all on good intent
<dt>Alone about the world unwearied went
<dt>For love of human kind, nor sought for gold.
<dt>His face was beautiful with thought; his hold
<dt>Of life but frail--as if he had been meant
<dt>For gentle ways, and could not have been sent
<dt>To battle with a world that bought and sold.
<dt>A wistful far-off look grew in his eyes
<dt>As if they said to all, "Good-night, farewell!"
<dt>Farewell it was. In groves of paradise
<dt>A radiant maiden meets him. "Who art thou?"
<dt>He asks. "For none so fair on earth did dwell."
<dt>"<i>I am thy deeds</i>," she says, "<i>that greet thee now!</i>"
