<h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>In the profound and dreadful calm of night,
<dt>Worn with the newness of my grief, I come
<dt>Dry-eyed, and fall beside you, spent and dumb,
<dt>Dreading the dawn, with all its aching light;
<p>
<dt>Dreading the day, and all it holds for me
<dt>Of restlessness and forms that come and go;
<dt>New things to do, new things to see and know,
<dt>That were not yet, when you were there to see;
<p>
<dt>And shut my eyes, and for a while pretend
<dt>That I can lean against you, feel your hand,
<dt>Hear your heart beat, and know you understand,
<dt>Though you are farther than the wide world's end.
<p>
<dt>Ah! My Belov&eacute;d, swiftly, silently,
<dt>Surely your kind, kind ghost shall comfort me.
<p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>It cannot be that you shall no more come
<dt>Radiant with laughter, holding hands for mine,
<dt>Seeking my soul for Love's most earnest sign,
<dt>Meeting my thought with eloquent thought and dumb
<p>
<dt>It cannot be that I must look for you
<dt>There, where the Summer flames, and find you not;
<dt>Of splendid sunsets know you all forgot,
<dt>Nor find you in the rain, nor the sky's blue.
<p>
<dt>For here the lily all her sweetness yields,
<dt>And all my heart is open to the sun;
<dt>And, seeking peace in grief, the long day done,
<dt>I find it in the silver, moonlit fields.
<p>
<dt>Then, by the beauty of the world I know
<dt>That you are here, and will not let me go.
