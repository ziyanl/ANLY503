<dt>When He returns, and finds all sleeping here--
<dt>Some old, some young, some fair, and some not fair,
<dt>Will He stoop down and whisper in each ear
<dt>"Awaken!" or for pity's sake forbear,--
<dt>Saying, "How shall I meet their frozen stare
<dt>Of wonder, and their eyes so woebegone?
<dt>How shall I comfort them in their despair,
<dt>If they cry out 'too late! let us sleep on'?"
<dt>Perchance He will not wake us up, but when
<dt>He sees us look so happy in our rest,
<dt>Will murmur, "Poor dead women and dead men!
<dt>Dire was their doom, and weary was their quest.
<dt>Wherefore awake them unto life again?
<dt>Let them sleep on untroubled--it is best."

<dt>O Rainbow, Rainbow! on the livid height,
<dt>Softening its ashen outline into dream,
<dt>Dewy yet brilliant, delicately bright
<dt>As pink wild-roses' leaves, why dost thou gleam
<dt>So beckoningly? whom dost thou invite
<dt>Still higher upward on the bitter quest?
<dt>What dost thou promise to the weary sight
<dt>In that strange region whence thou issuest?
<dt>Speak'st thou of pensive runlets by whose side
<dt>Our dear ones wander sweet and gentle-eyed,
<dt>In the soft dawn of a diviner Day?
<dt>Art thou a promise? Come those hues and dyes
<dt>From heavenly meads, near which thou dost arise
<dt>Iris'd from Quiet Waters, far away?
