<dt>They said of her, "She never can have felt
<dt>The sorrows that our deeper natures feel":
<dt>They said, "Her placid lips have never spelt
<dt>Hard lessons taught by Pain; her eyes reveal
<dt>No passionate yearning, no perplexed appeal
<dt>To other eyes. Love and her heart have dealt
<dt>With her but lightly."--When the Pilgrims dwelt
<dt>First on these shores, lest savage hands should steal
<dt>To precious graves with desecrating tread,
<dt>The burial-field was with the ploughshare crossed
<dt>And there the maize her silken tresses tossed.
<dt>With thanks those Pilgrims ate their bitter bread,
<dt>While peaceful harvests hid what they had lost.
<dt>--What if her smiles concealed from you her dead?
