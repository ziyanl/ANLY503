<h2><a href="longfell.htm">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a></h2>
<p>
<dt>Thou wast not robbed of wonder when youth fled,
<dt>But still the bud had promise to thine eyes,
<dt>And beauty was not sundered from surprise,
<dt>And reverent, as reverend, was thy head.
<dt>Thy life was music, and thou mad'st it ours,
<dt>Not thine, crude scorn of gentle household things;
<dt>And yet thy spirit had the sea-bird's wings,
<dt>Nor rested long among the chestnut-flowers.
<dt>Spain's coast of charm, and all the North Sea's cold
<dt>Thou knewest, and thou knewest the soul of eld,
<dt>And dusty scroll and volume we beheld
<dt>To gold transmuted--not to hard-wrought gold,
<dt>But that clear shining of the eastern air,
<dt>When Helios rising shakes the splendour of his hair.
