<a name=010></a><h2>The Snowing of the Pines</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Softer than silence, stiller than still air,
<dt>Float down from high pine boughs the slender leaves.
<dt>The forest floor its annual boon receives
<dt>That comes like snowfall, tireless, tranquil, fair.
<dt>Gently they glide, gently they clothe the bare
<dt>Old rocks with grace. Their fall a mantle weaves
<dt>Of paler yellow than autumnal sheaves
<dt>Or those strange blossoms the witch-hazels wear.
<dt>Athwart long aisles the sunbeams pierce their way;
<dt>High up, the crows are gathering for the night;
<dt>The delicate needles fill the air; the jay
<dt>Takes through their golden mist his radiant flight;
<dt>They fall and fall, till at November's close
<dt>The snow-flakes drop as lightly--snows on snows.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Baby Sorceress</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My baby sits beneath the tall elm-trees,
<dt>A wreath of tangled ribbons in her hands;
<dt>She twines and twists the many-coloured strands,--
<dt>A little sorceress, weaving destinies.
<dt>Now the pure white she grasps; now naught can please
<dt>But strips of crimson, lurid as the brands
<dt>From passion's fires; or yellow, like the sands
<dt>That lend soft netting to the azure seas.
<dt>And so with sweet, incessant toil she fills
<dt>A summer hour, still following fancies new,
<dt>Till through my heart a sudden terror thrills
<dt>Lest, as she weaves, her aimless choice prove true.
<dt>Thank God! our Fates proceed not from our wills:
<dt>The Power that spins the thread shall blend the hue.
