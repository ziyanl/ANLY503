<p>
<dt>No more these passion-worn faces shall men's eyes
<dt>Behold in life. Death leaves no trace behind
<dt>Of their wild hate and wilder love, grown blind
<dt>In desperate longing, more than the foam which lies
<dt>Splashed up awhile where the showered spray descries
<dt>The waves whereto their cold limbs were resign'd;
<dt>Yet ever doth the sea-wind's undefin'd
<dt>Vague wailing shudder with their dying sighs.
<dt>For all men's souls 'twixt sorrow and love are cast
<dt>As on the earth each lingers his brief space,
<dt>While surely nightfall comes where each man's face
<dt>In death's obliteration sinks at last
<dt>As a deserted wind-tossed sea's foam-trace--
<dt>Life's chilled boughs emptied by death's autumn-blast.
