<a name=100></a><h2>Ozymandias</h2><a href="/audio/ozymand.ram"><IMG border=0 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="raicon.gif" ALT="realaudio file"></a>
<P>
<dt>I met a traveller from an antique land
<dt>Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
<dt>Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,
<dt>Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
<dt>And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
<dt>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
<dt>Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
<dt>The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
<dt>And on the pedestal these words appear:
<dt>"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
<dt>Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
<dt>Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
<dt>Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
<dt>The lone and level sands stretch far away.
</P>
<a name=200></a><h2>Sonnet: England in 1819</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king,--
<dt>Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who
<dt>Through public scorn,--mud from a muddy spring,--
<dt>Rulers who neither see, nor feel, nor know,
<dt>But leech-like to their fainting country cling,
<dt>Till they drop, blind in blood, without a blow,--
<dt>A people starved and stabbed in the untilled field,--
<dt>An army, which liberticide and prey
<dt>Makes as a two-edged sword to all who wield,--
<dt>Golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay;
<dt>Religion Christless, Godless--a book sealed;
<dt>A Senate,  Time's worst statute unrepealed,--
<dt>Are graves, from which a glorious Phantom may
<dt>Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day.
</P>
<a name=300></a><h2>"Lift not the painted veil which those who live"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Lift not the painted veil which those who live
<dt>Call Life: though unreal shapes be pictured there,
<dt>And it but mimic all we would believe
<dt>With colours idly spread,--behind, lurk Fear
<dt>And Hope, twin Destinies; who ever weave
<dt>Their shadows, o'er the chasm, sightless and drear.
<dt>I knew one who had lifted it--he sought,
<dt>For his lost heart was tender, things to love,
<dt>But found them not, alas! nor was there aught
<dt>The world contains, the which he could approve.
<dt>Through the unheeding many he did move,
<dt>A splendour among shadows, a bright blot
<dt>Upon this gloomy scene, a Spirit that strove
<dt>For truth, and like the Preacher found it not.
</P>
<a name=400></a><h2>To Wordsworth</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know
<dt>That things depart which never may return:
<dt>Childhood and youth, friendship and love's first glow,
<dt>Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving thee to mourn.
<dt>These common woes I feel. One loss is mine
<dt>Which thou too feel'st, yet I alone deplore.
<dt>Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine
<dt>On some frail bark in winter's midnight roar:
<dt>Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stood
<dt>Above the blind and battling multitude:
<dt>In honored poverty thy voice did weave
<dt>Songs consecrate to truth and liberty,--
<dt>Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,
<dt>Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be.
</P>
<a name=500></a><h2>Feelings of a Republican on the Fall of Bonaparte</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>I hated thee, fallen tyrant! I did groan
<dt>To think that a most unambitious slave,
<dt>Like thou, shouldst dance and revel on the grave
<dt>Of Liberty. Thou mightst have built thy throne
<dt>Where it had stood even now: thou didst prefer
<dt>A frail and bloody pomp which Time has swept
<dt>In fragments towards Oblivion. Massacre,
<dt>For this I prayed, would on thy sleep have crept,
<dt>Treason and Slavery, Rapine, Fear, and Lust,
<dt>And stifled thee, their minister. I know
<dt>Too late, since thou and France are in the dust,
<dt>That Virtue owns a more eternal foe
<dt>Than Force or Fraud: old Custom, legal Crime,
<dt>And bloody Faith the foulest birth of Time.
</P>
