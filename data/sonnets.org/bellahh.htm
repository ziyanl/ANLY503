<a name=010></a><h2>The Thrush</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Loud from its wicker cage the thrush yet sings;
<dt>The blackbird pipes, though now it may no more
<dt>Flit through the orchard as it did before;
<dt>In spite of bars, the lark its carollings
<dt>Still pours, and stretches still its useless wings
<dt>As when it could at will to heaven soar.
<dt>In sooth, though it should be a dungeon floor,
<dt>The place is nought. If God has touched the strings,
<dt>The music of his soul in melodies
<dt>E'en there the wretched captive will outpour;
<dt>Will even there to dull insensate things
<dt>Attune his harp, as Orpheus oft of yore,
<dt>So poets tell, in his sad wanderings
<dt>Played to the rocks and hills and brooks and trees.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>To Viola</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Deck thee with jewels from the Indian mine,
<dt>And fetch thy robes from silken Samarcand;
<dt>Such never shall thy beauteous eyes outshine,
<dt>Nor these outshame the lily of thy hand.
<dt>Take to thee gold; it shall not that outvie
<dt>Poured by thy locks in such a flowing stream;
<dt>Lay to thy bosom pearls; and could these sigh,
<dt>Then would they sigh that they might fairer seem.
<dt>But oh! ten thousand others can do this,
<dt>And charm for charm display as well as thou;
<dt>Can smile as sweet, and as divinely kiss,
<dt>And show as fair a hand, as smooth a brow;
<dt>Ten thousand others can do this, but none
<dt>Can move this heart to love, as thou hast done.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>On Freedom</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In Freedom's cause it were a joy to die!
<dt>The stake, the dungeon, and the gory block,
<dt>These are the deep foundations of that rock
<dt>Whence rise the sacred walls of Liberty.
<dt>Each groan, each tear, each whitened hair, each sigh,
<dt>Each rusted chain, each bolt, each bar, each lock,
<dt>What are they but the powers at last which mock
<dt>The baffled rage of dying Tyranny?
<dt>Thus, when all's done which mortal man can do,
<dt>The last word spoken tyrants dread to hear,
<dt>The last bow struck, it were indeed a shame
<dt>If we, at Freedom's call, should fail to bear
<dt>With dignity that lot she grants but few--
<dt>To die, and dying bless her sacred name.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Dead Memories</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As when a son by his dead father kneels,
<dt>And cries, "Forgive me! Father, I repent!"
<dt>Those pallid lips make no acknowledgment,
<dt>Nor any smile across those features steals;
<dt>Yea, though he grasps his hand, the dead nor feels,
<dt>Nor moves, nor knows the form above him bent,
<dt>But now past all approval or dissent,
<dt>Turns a deaf ear to all that son's appeals:
<dt>So, too, with us, when tearfully we stand
<dt>Beside dead memories of the days which were;
<dt>Could we but grasp again that loving hand!
<dt>Could we but speak again to him or her!
<dt>In vain; as well expect at our command
<dt>The silent dead to smile again or stir.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Submission</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Be nothing altered of all God hath done;
<dt>For who can work divinely fair as He?
<dt>Who knows what is, and more, what is to be,
<dt>And what to use, and what to let alone;
<dt>Nor doth He need to move again that stone
<dt>Once laid; nor doth He lack the power, as we,
<dt>To add to all its matchless symmetry,
<dt>From Ophir, gold, and beams from Lebanon:
<dt>So to build up the white dome of the soul,
<dt>A stately palace, an eternal home,
<dt>For God Himself at length made pure and fit,
<dt>Where with great power the Lord Himself will come,
<dt>And with assembled angels crown the whole
<dt>With songs and shoutings of "Grace! grace to it!"
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>To Stella</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name=061></a><h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>I see thee go about thy household ways,
<dt>And nothing count too irksome or too mean,
<dt>Which being done had earned another's praise,
<dt>Or being left, some other's grief had been,
<dt>Or being spoken, had laid balm between
<dt>The breath of slander and the wounded part,
<dt>Or being thought, had caused the judgment lean
<dt>Less to the brain and more unto the heart.
<dt>And so from room to room I see thee move,
<dt>And all the house to fill with quietness,
<dt>That all who see thee must perforce thee love,
<dt>That all who hear thee must perforce thee bless.
<dt>Like some bright angel, doomed to penance here
<dt>For some slight fault, so dost thou, love, appear.
<p>
<a name=062></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>O be thou 'ware, since thus on thee I look,
<dt>Thou lead me not in any wise astray.
<dt>Seek thou Heaven's grace; and, lady, see thou brook
<dt>No sin upon thy soul by night or day.
<dt>I toil on after; up the shining way
<dt>I would ascend; be thou my spirit's guide.
<dt>There is no joy like theirs who thus assay,
<dt>Nor shall be crown that brighter shines beside.
<dt>I charge thee, then, by all of good and fair,
<dt>That thou pursue unmoved thy upward road--
<dt>To fairer scenes, to realms of purer air,
<dt>To nobler heights, to heaven, and to God.
<dt>I follow on, now near, and now afar;
<dt>But yet I follow on, O my life's star!
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>Truth</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Love Health, but let it be the love of youth;
<dt>Love Peace, but let it be before the fray;
<dt>Love Mercy, but before you go astray,
<dt>And you yourself have need of pitying ruth;
<dt>Love Wisdom's ways, but love them most, in sooth,
<dt>Ere Folly turns your locks to sober gray;
<dt>Love Purity, since love her well you may;
<dt>But most of all, love early golden Truth.
<dt>She is of such divinity that where
<dt>She leads all other graces still attend,
<dt>As do the roses the sweet month of June;
<dt>But she away, those graces have an end,
<dt>And perish as the flowers of summer, soon
<dt>As autumn with his breath makes all things bare.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>Acquiescence</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Be nothing altered of all God hath done!
<dt>I would not now have back these weary years
<dt>To spend them other than I have, thou tears
<dt>Alone could win them. What God hath begun
<dt>I pray to Him to finish. When we shun
<dt>Those ills our sin-sick heart for ever fears,
<dt>And choose the good, or that which good appears,
<dt>Were God as we, how soon our course were run!
<dt>Who knows life's chart entire, knows best to steer
<dt>Our erring craft across its fitful sea.
<dt>Little our progress while the skies are clear;
<dt>But when God's storm breaks forth tumultuously,
<dt>Each fearful gust brings us to land more near,
<dt>And to that haven where our souls would be.
