<P>William Drummond of Hawthornden had a large library from which his sonnets borrowed freely.  <i>Poems</i> (1616) is divided into two parts, following the lead of Petrarch--the first part addressed to his mistress in life and the second in death.  I have omitted the many other poems, madrigals, and songs that were originally interspersed among the sonnets; numbers are provided only to indicate the sonnets' order in the work--this is <i>not</i> a continuous sequence.  Modernizations and footnotes are from <a href="bibliogr.htm#ward">Ward</a> unless otherwise noted. Some original versions can be found at the <a href="http://synergy.arts.gla.ac.uk/COMET/scots/sonn.htm">University of Glascow</a>.

<h1>Poems: The First Part</h1>
<a name=001></a><h2>I</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In my first years, and prime yet not at height,
<dt>When sweet conceits my wits did entertain,
<dt>Ere beauty's force I knew, or false delight,
<dt>Or to what oar she did her captives chain,
<dt>Led by a sacred troop of Phoebus' train,
<dt>I first began to read, then lov'd to write,
<dt>And so to praise a perfect red and white,
<dt>But, God wot, wist not what was in my brain:
<dt>Love smil'd to see in what an awful guise
<dt>I turn'd those antiques of the age of gold,
<dt>And, that I might more mysteries behold,
<dt>He set so fair a volume to mine eyes,
<dt>That I (quires clos'd which, dead, dead sighs but breathe)
<dt>Joy on this living book to read my death.
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>II</h2>
<P>
<dt>I know that all beneath the moon decays
<dt>And what by mortals in this world is brought,
<dt>In Time's great periods shall return to nought;
<dt>That fairest states have fatal nights and days;
<dt>I know how all the Muse's heavenly lays,
<dt>With toil of spright which are so dearly bought,
<dt>As idle sounds, of few or none are sought,
<dt>And that nought lighter is than airy praise;
<dt>I know frail beauty like the purple flower,
<dt>To which one morn oft birth and death affords;
<dt>That love a jarring is of minds' accords,
<dt>Where sense and will invassal reason's power:
<dt>Know what I list, this all can not me move,
<dt>But that, O me! I both must write and love.
</P>
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Ye who so curiously do paint your thoughts,
<dt>Enlight'ning ev'ry line in such a guise,
<dt>That they seem rather to have fall'n from skies,
<dt>Than of a human hand be mortal draughts;
<dt>In one part Sorrow so tormented lies,
<dt>As if his life at ev'ry sigh would part;
<dt>Love here blindfolded stands with bow and dart,
<dt>There Hope looks pale, Despair with rainy eyes:
<dt>Of my rude pencil look not for such art,
<dt>My wit I find now lessened to devise
<dt>So high conceptions to express my smart,
<dt>And some think love but feign'd, if too too wise.
<dt>These troubled words and lines confus'd you find,
<dt>Are like unto their model, my sick mind.
</p>
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>IV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Fair is my yoke, though grievous be my pains,
<dt>Sweet are my wounds, although they deeply smart,
<dt>My bit is gold, though shortened be the reins,
<dt>My bondage brave, though I may not depart:
<dt>Although I burn, the fire which doth impart
<dt>Those flames, so sweet reviving force contains,
<dt>That, like Arabia's bird, my wasted heart,
<dt>Made quick by death, more lively still remains.
<dt>I joy, though oft my waking eyes spend tears,
<dt>I never want delight, even when I groan,
<dt>Best companied when most I am alone;
<dt>A heaven of hopes I have midst hells of fears.
<dt>Thus every way contentment strange I find,
<dt>But most in her rare beauty, my rare mind.
</p>
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>V</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How that vast heaven int&#105;tled First is roll'd,
<dt>If any other worlds beyond it lie,
<dt>And people living in eternity,
<dt>Or essence pure that doth this All uphold;
<dt>What motion have those fixed sparks of gold,
<dt>The wand'ring carbuncles which shine from high,
<dt>By sprights, or bodies, contrare-ways in sky
<dt>If they be turn'd, and mortal things behold;
<dt>How sun posts heaven about, how night's pale queen
<dt>With borrowed beams looks on this hanging round,
<dt>What cause fair Iris hath, and monsters seen
<dt>In air's large fields of light, and seas profound,
<dt>Did hold my wand'ring thoughts, when thy sweet eye
<dt>Bade me leave all, and only think on thee.
</p>
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>VI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Vaunt not, fair heavens, of your two glorious lights
<dt>Which, though most bright, yet see not when they shine,
<dt>And shining, cannot show their beams divine
<dt>Both in one place, but part by days and nights;
<dt>Earth, vaunt not of those treasures ye enshrine,
<dt>Held only dear because hid from our sights,
<dt>Your pure and burnish'd gold, your diamonds fine,
<dt>Snow-passing ivory that the eye delights;
<dt>Nor, seas, of those dear wares are in you found,
<dt>Vaunt not, rich pearl, red coral, which do stir
<dt>A fond desire in fools to plunge your ground;
<dt>Those all, more fair, are to be had in her;
<dt>Pearl, ivory, coral, diamond, suns, gold,
<dt>Teeth, neck, lips, heart, eyes, hair, are to behold.
</p>
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>VII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>That learned <a href="#999">Grecian</a>, who did so excel
<dt>In knowledge passing sense, that he is nam'd
<dt>Of all the after-worlds divine, doth tell,
<dt>That at the time when first our souls are fram'd,
<dt>Ere in these mansions blind they come to dwell,
<dt>They live bright rays of that eternal light,
<dt>And others see, know, love, in heaven's great height,
<dt>Not toil'd with aught to reason doth rebel.
<dt>Most true it is, for straight at the first sight
<dt>My mind me told, that in some other place
<dt>It elsewhere saw the idea of that face,
<dt>And lov'd a love of heavenly pure delight;
<dt>No wonder now I feel so fair a flame,
<dt>Sith I her lov'd ere on this earth she came.

<p>
<dt>Now while the night her sable veil hath spread,
<dt>And silently her resty coach doth roll,
<dt>Rousing with her from Tethys' azure bed
<dt>Those starry nymphs which dance about the pole;
<dt>While Cynthia, in purest cypress clad,
<dt>The Latmian shepherd in a trance descries,
<dt>And whiles looks pale from height of all the skies,
<dt>Whiles dyes her beauties in a bashful red;
<dt>While sleep, in triumph, closed hath all eyes,
<dt>And birds and beasts a silence sweet do keep,
<dt>And Proteus' monstrous people in the deep,
<dt>The winds and waves, husht up, to rest entice;
<dt>I wake, muse, weep, and who my heart hath slain
<dt>See still before me to augment my pain.
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>IX</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sleep, Silence' child, sweet father of soft rest,
<dt>Prince, whose approach peace to all mortals brings,
<dt>Indifferent host to shepherds and to kings,
<dt>Sole comforter of minds with grief opprest;
<dt>Lo, by thy charming rod all breathing things
<dt>Lie slumb'ring, with forgetfulness possest,
<dt>And yet o'er me to spread thy drowsy wings
<dt>Thou spares, alas! who cannot be thy guest.
<dt>Since I am thine, O come, but with that face
<dt>To inward light which thou art wont to show,
<dt>With feigned solace ease a true-felt woe;
<dt>Or if, deaf god, thou do deny that grace,
<dt>Come as thou wilt, and what thou wilt bequeath,
<dt>I long to kiss the image of my death.
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>X</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Fair Moon, who with thy cold and silver shine
<dt>Makes sweet the horror of the dreadful night,
<dt>Delighting the weak eye with smiles divine,
<dt>Which Phoebus dazzles with his too much light;
<dt>Bright Queen of the first Heaven, if in thy shrine,
<dt>By turning oft, and Heaven's eternal might,
<dt>Thou hast not yet that once sweet fire of thine,
<dt>Endymion, forgot, and lover's plight;
<dt>If cause like thine may pity breed in thee,
<dt>And pity somewhat else to it obtain,
<dt>Since thou hast power of dreams, as well as he
<dt>Who paints strange figures in the slumb'ring brain,
<dt>Now while she sleeps, in doleful guise her show
<dt>These tears, and the black map of all my woe.
<p>
<a name=011></a><h2>XI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lamp of heaven's crystal hall that brings the hours,
<dt>Eye-dazzler, who makes the ugly night
<dt>At thine approach fly to her slumb'ry bow'rs,
<dt>And fills the world with wonder and delight;
<dt>Life of all lives, death-giver by thy flight
<dt>To southern pole from these six signs of ours,
<dt>Goldsmith of all the stars, with silver bright
<dt>Who moon enamels, Apelles of the flow'rs;
<dt>Ah! from those watery plains thy golden head
<dt>Raise up, and bring the so long lingering morn;
<dt>A grave, nay, hell, I find become this bed,
<dt>This bed so grievously where I am torn;
<dt>But, woe is me! though thou now brought the day,
<dt>Day shall but serve more sorrow to display.
<p>
<a name=012></a><h2>XII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Ah! burning thoughts, now let me take some rest,
<dt>And your tumultuous broils a while appease;
<dt>Is 't not enough, stars, fortune, love molest
<dt>Me all at once, but ye must too displease?
<dt>Let hope, though false, yet lodge within my breast,
<dt>My high attempt, though dangerous, yet praise.
<dt>What though I trace not right heaven's steepy ways?
<dt>It doth suffice, my fall shall make me blest.
<dt>I do not doat on days, nor fear not death;
<dt>So that my life be brave, what though not long?
<dt>Let me renown'd live from the vulgar throng,
<dt>And when ye list, heavens! take this borrowed breath.
<dt>Men but like visions are, time all doth claim;
<dt>He lives, who dies to win a lasting name.
<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>XIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O sacred blush, impurpling cheeks' pure skies
<dt>With crimson wings which spread thee like the morn;
<dt>O bashful look, sent from those shining eyes,
<dt>Which, though cast down on earth, couldst heaven adorn;
<dt>O tongue, in which most luscious nectar lies,
<dt>That can at once both bless and make forlorn;
<dt>Dear coral lip, which beauty beautifies,
<dt>That trembling stood ere that her words were born;
<dt>And you her words, words, no, but golden chains,
<dt>Which did captive mine ears, ensnare my soul,
<dt>Wise image of her mind, mind that contains
<dt>A power, all power of senses to control;
<dt>Ye all from love dissuade so sweetly me,
<dt>That I love more, if more my love could be.

<p>
<dt>Nor Arne, nor Mincius, nor stately Tiber,
<dt>Sebethus, nor the flood into whose streams
<dt>He fell who burnt the world with borrow'd beams,
<dt>Gold-rolling Tagus, Munda, famous Iber,
<dt>Sorgue, Rhone, Loire, Garron, nor proud-banked Seine,
<dt>Peneus, Phasis, Xanthus, humble Ladon,
<dt>Nor she whose nymphs excel her who lov'd Adon,
<dt>Fair Tamesis, nor Ister large, nor Rhine,
<dt>Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, Hermus, Gange,
<dt>Pearly Hydaspes, serpent-like Meander,
<dt>The gulf bereft sweet Hero her Leander,
<dt>Nile, that far his hidden head doth range,
<dt>Have ever had so rare a cause of praise,
<dt>As Ora, where this northern Phoenix stays.

<p>
<dt>To hear my plaints, fair river crystalline,
<dt>Thou in a silent slumber seems to stay;
<dt>Delicious flow'rs, lily and columbine,
<dt>Ye bow your heads when I my woes display;
<dt>Forests, in you the myrtle, palm, and bay,
<dt>Have had compassion list'ning to my groans;
<dt>The winds with sighs have solemniz'd my moans
<dt>'Mong leaves, which whispered what they could not say;
<dt>The caves, the rocks, the hills, the Sylvans' thrones,
<dt>(As if even pity did in them appear)
<dt>Have at my sorrows rent their ruthless stones;
<dt>Each thing I find hath sense except my dear,
<dt>Who doth not think I love, or will not know
<dt>My grief, perchance delighting in my woe.
<p>
<a name=016></a><h2>XVI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sweet brook, in whose clear crystal I mine eyes
<dt>Have oft seen great in labour of their tears;
<dt>Enamell'd bank, whose shining gravel bears
<dt>These sad characters of my miseries;
<dt>High woods, whose mounting tops menace the spheres;
<dt>Wild citizens, <a href="#999">Amphions of the trees</a>,
<dt>You gloomy groves at hottest noons which freeze,
<dt>Elysian shades, which Phoebus never clears;
<dt>Vast solitary mountains, pleasant plains,
<dt>Embroid'red meads that ocean-ways you reach;
<dt>Hills, dales, springs, all that my sad cry constrains
<dt>To take part of my plaints, and learn woe's speech,
<dt>Will that remorseless fair e'er pity show?
<dt>Of grace now answer if ye ought know. No.
<p>
<a name=017></a><h2>XVII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>With flaming horns the Bull now brings the year,
<dt>Melt do the horrid mountains' helms of snow,
<dt>The silver floods in pearly channels flow,
<dt>The late-bare woods green anadems do wear;
<dt>The nightingale, forgetting winter's woe,
<dt>Calls up the lazy morn her notes to hear;
<dt>Those flow'rs are spread which names of princes bear,
<dt>Some red, some azure, white and golden grow;
<dt>Here lows a heifer, there <a href="#999">bea-wailing</a> strays
<dt>A harmless lamb, not far a stag rebounds;
<dt>The shepherds sing to grazing flocks sweet lays,
<dt>And all about the echoing air resounds.
<dt>Hills, dales, woods, floods, and everything doth change,
<dt>But she in rigour, I in love am strange.

<p>
<dt>When Nature now had wonderfully wrought
<dt>All Auristella's parts, except her eyes,
<dt>To make those twins two lamps in beauty's skies,
<dt>She counsel of her starry senate sought.
<dt>Mars and Apollo first did her advise
<dt>In colour black to wrap those comets bright,
<dt>That Love him so might soberly disguise,
<dt>And unperceived, wound at every sight.
<dt>Chaste Phoebe spake for purest azure dyes,
<dt>But Jove and Venus green about the light
<dt>To frame thought best, as brigging most delight,
<dt>That to pin'd hearts. hope might for aye arise:
<dt>Nature, all said, a paradise of green
<dt>There plac'd, to make all love which have them seen.

<p>
<dt>In vain I haunt the cold and silver springs,
<dt>To quench the fever burning in my veins;
<dt>In vain, love's pilgrim, mountains, dales, and plains,
<dt>I overrun; vain help long absence brings:
<dt>In vain, my friends, your counsel me constrains
<dt>To fly, and place my thoughts on other things.
<dt>Ah! like the bird that fired hath her wings,
<dt>The more I move, the greater are my pains.
<dt>Desire, alas! Desire, a Zeuxis new,
<dt>From Indies borrowing gold, from western skies
<dt>Most bright <a href="#999">cynoper</a>, sets before mine eyes
<dt>In every place, her hair, sweet look, and hue:
<dt>That fly, run, rest I, all doth prove but vain,
<dt>My life lies in those looks which have me slain.

<a name=020></a><h2>XX</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>All other beauties, howsoe'er they shine
<dt>In hairs more bright than is the golden ore,
<dt>Or cheeks more fair than fairest eglantine,
<dt>Or hands like <a href="#999">hers</a> who comes the sun before;
<dt>Match'd with that heavenly hue and shape divine,
<dt>With those dear stars which my weak thoughts adore,
<dt>Look but like shadows, or if they be more,
<dt>It is in that, that they are like to thine.
<dt>Who sees those eyes, their force and doth not prove,
<dt>Who gazeth on the dimple of that chin,
<dt>And finds not Venus' son intrench'd therein,
<dt>Or hath not sense, or knows not what is love.
<dt>To see thee had Narcissus had the grace,
<dt>He sure had died with wond'ring on thy face.

<p>
<dt>My tears may well Numidian lions tame,
<dt>And pity breed into the hardest heart
<dt>That ever Pyrrha did to maid impart,
<dt>When she them first of blushing rocks did frame.
<dt>Ah! eyes which only serve to wail my smart,
<dt>How long will you mine inward woes proclaim?
<dt>Let it suffice, you bear a weeping part
<dt>All night, at day though ye do not the same:
<dt>Cease, idle sighs, to spend your storms in vain,
<dt>And these calm secret shades more to molest
<dt>Contain you in the prison of my breast,
<dt>You do not ease but aggravate my pain;
<dt>Or, if burst forth you must, that tempest move
<dt>In sight of her whom I so dearly love.

<p>
<dt>Nymphs, sister nymphs, which haunt this crystal brook,
<dt>And, happy, in these floating bowers abide,
<dt>Where trembling roofs of trees from sun you hide,
<dt>Which make ideal woods in every crook;
<dt>Whether ye garlands for your locks provide,
<dt>Or pearly letters seek in sandy hook,
<dt>Or count your loves when Thetis was a bride,
<dt>Lift up your golden heads and on me look.
<dt>Read in mine eyes mine agonising cares,
<dt>And what ye read recount to her again:
<dt>Fair nymphs, say, all these streams are but my tears,
<dt>And if she ask you how they sweet remain,
<dt>Tell that the bitterest tears which eyes can pour,
<dt>When shed for her do cease more to be sour.

<p>
<dt>Then is she gone? O fool and coward I!
<dt>O good occasion lost, ne'er to be found!
<dt>What fatal chains have my dull senses bound,
<dt>When best they may, that they not fortune try?
<dt>Here is the flow'ry bed where she did lie,
<dt>With roses here she stellified the ground,
<dt>She fix'd her eyes on this yet smiling pond,
<dt>Nor time, nor courteous place, seem'd ought deny.
<dt>Too long, too long, Respect, I do embrace
<dt>Your counsel, full of threats and sharp disdain;
<dt>Disdain in her sweet heart can have no place,
<dt>And though come there, must straight retire again
<dt>Henceforth, Respect, farewell, I oft hear told
<dt>Who lives in love can never be too bold.

<p>
<dt>In mind's pure glass when I myself behold,
<dt>And vively see how my best days are spent,
<dt>What clouds of care above my head are roll'd,
<dt>What coming harms which I can not prevent:
<dt>My begun course I, wearied, do repent,
<dt>And would embrace what reason oft hath told;
<dt>But scarce thus think I, when love hath controll'd
<dt>All the best reasons reason could invent.

<dt>And his to whom a vulture eats the heart;
<dt>One tells of spectres in enchanted woods.
<dt>Of all those pains he who the worst would prove,
<dt>Let him be absent, and but pine in love.

<dt>Place me where angry Titan burns the Moor,
<dt>And thirsty Afric fiery monsters brings,
<dt>Or where the new-born phoenix spreads her wings,
<dt>And troops of wond'ring birds her flight adore;
<dt>Place me by Gange, or Ind's empamper'd shore,
<dt>Where smiling heavens on earth cause double springs;
<dt>Place me where Neptune's quire of syrens sings,
<dt>Or where, made hoarse through cold, he leaves to roar;
<dt>Me place where Fortune doth her darlings crown,
<dt>A wonder or a spark in Envy's eye,
<dt>Or let outrageous fates upon me frown,
<dt>And pity wailing see disaster'd me;
<dt>Affection's print my mind so deep doth prove,
<dt>I may forget myself, but not my love.

<p>
<dt>Of mortal glory, O soon darken'd ray!
<dt>O posting joys of man, more swift than wind!
<dt>O fond desires, which wing'd with fancies stray!
<dt>O trait'rous hopes, which do our judgments blind!
<dt>Lo! in a flash that light is gone away,
<dt>Which dazzle did each eye, delight each mind,
<dt>And with that sun, from whence it came, combin'd,
<dt>Now makes more radiant heaven's eternal day.
<dt>Let Beauty now bedew her cheeks with tears,
<dt>Let widow'd Music only roar and plain;
<dt>Poor Virtue, get thee wings, and mount the spheres,
<dt>And let thine only name on earth remain.
<dt>Death hath thy temple raz'd, Love's empire foil'd,
<dt>The world of honour, worth, and sweetness spoil'd.

<p>
<dt>Those eyes, those sparkling sapphires of delight,
<dt>Which thousand thousand hearts did set on fire,
<dt>Which made that eye of heaven that brings the light,
<dt>Oft jealous, stay amaz'd them to admire;
<dt>That living snow, those crimson roses bright,
<dt>Those pearls, those rubies, which did breed desire,
<dt>Those locks of gold, that purple fair of Tyre,
<dt>Are wrapt, ay me! up in eternal night.
<dt>What hast thou more to vaunt of, wretched world,
<dt>Sith she, who cursed thee made blest, is gone?
<dt>Thine ever-burning lamps, rounds ever whirl'd,
<dt>Can unto thee not model such a one:
<dt>For if they would such beauty bring on earth,
<dt>They should be forc'd again to make her <a href="#999">breath</a>.

<p>
<dt>O fate! conspir'd to pour your worst on me,
<dt>O rigorous rigour, which doth all confound!
<dt>With cruel hands ye have cut down the tree,
<dt>And fruit and flower dispersed on the ground.
<dt>A little space of earth my love doth bound;
<dt>That beauty which did raise it to the sky,
<dt>Turn'd in neglected dust, now low doth lie,
<dt>Deaf to my plaints, and senseless of my wound.
<dt>Ah! did I live for this? Ah! did I love?
<dt>For this and was it she did so excel?
<dt>That ere she well life's sweet-sour joys did prove,
<dt>She should, too dear a guest, with horror dwell?
<dt>Weak influence of heaven! what fair ye frame,
<dt>Falls in the prime, and passeth like a dream.

<dt>O woful life! Life? No, but living death,
<dt>Frail boat of crystal in a rocky sea,
<dt>A sport expos'd to Fortune's stormy breath,
<dt>Which kept with pain, with terror doth decay:
<dt>The false delights, true woes thou dost bequeath,
<dt>Mine all-appalled mind do so affray,
<dt>That I those envy who are laid in earth,
<dt>And pity them that run thy dreadful way.
<dt>When did mine eyes behold one cheerful morn?
<dt>When had my tossed soul one night of rest?
<dt>When did not hateful stars my projects scorn?
<dt>O! now I find for mortals what is best;
<dt>Even, sith our voyage shameful is, and short,
<dt>Soon to strike sail, and perish in the port.

<p>
<dt>Mine eyes, dissolve your globes in briny streams,
<dt>And with a cloud of sorrow dim your sight;
<dt>The sun's bright sun is set, of late whose beams
<dt>Gave lustre to your day, day to your night.
<dt>My voice, now deafen earth with anathemes,
<dt>Roar forth a challenge in the world's despite,
<dt>Tell that disguised grief is her delight,
<dt>That life a slumber is of fearful dreams.
<dt>And, woful mind, abhor to think of joy;
<dt>My senses all now comfortless you hide,
<dt>Accept no object but of black annoy,
<dt>Tears, plaints, sighs, mourning weeds, graves gaping wide.
<dt>I have nought left to wish, my hopes are dead,
<dt>And all with her beneath a marble laid.

<a name=200></a><h2>"My lute, be as thou wert when thou didst grow"</h2>
<P>
<dt>My lute, be as thou wert when thou didst grow
<dt>With thy green mother in some shady grove,
<dt>When immelodious winds but made thee move,
<dt>And birds their ramage did on the bestow.
<dt>Since that dear Voice which did thy sounds approve,
<dt>Which wont in such harmonious strains to flow,
<dt>Is reft from Earth to tune those spheres above,
<dt>What art thou but a harbinger of woe?
<dt>Thy pleasing notes be pleasing notes no more,
<dt>But orphans' wailings to the fainting ear;
<dt>Each stroke a sigh, each sound draws forth a tear;
<dt>For which be silint as in woods before;
<dt>Or if that any hand to touch thee deign,
<dt>Like widow'd turtle still her loss complain.
