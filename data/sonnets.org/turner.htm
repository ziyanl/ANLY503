<a name=100></a><h2>The Buoy-Bell</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How like the leper, with his own sad cry
<dt>Enforcing his own solitude, it tolls!
<dt>That lonely bell set in the rushing shoals,
<dt>To warn us from the place of jeopardy!
<dt>O friend of man! sore-vex'd by ocean's power,
<dt>The changing tides wash o'er thee day by day;
<dt>Thy trembling mouth is fill'd with bitter spray,
<dt>Yet still thou ringest on from hour to hour;
<dt>High is thy mission, though thy lot is wild--
<dt>To be in danger's realm a guardian sound;
<dt>In seamen's dreams a pleasant part to bear,
<dt>And earn their blessing as the year goes round,
<dt>And strike the keynote of each grateful prayer,
<dt>Breath'd in their distant homes by wife or child!
</p>
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>Orion</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How oft I've watch'd thee from the garden croft,
<dt>In silence, when the busy day was done,
<dt>Shining with wondrous brilliancy aloft,
<dt>And flickering like a casement 'gainst the sun!
<dt>I've seen thee soar from out some snowy cloud,
<dt>Which held the frozen breath of land and sea,
<dt>Yet broke and sever'd as the wind grew loud
<dt>But earth-bound winds could not dismember thee,
<dt>Nor shake thy frame of jewels; I have guess'd
<dt>At thy strange shape and function, haply felt
<dt>The charm of that old myth about thy belt
<dt>And sword; but, most, my spirit was possess'd
<dt>By His great Presence, Who is never far
<dt>From his light-bearers, whether man or star.
</p>
<p>
<a name=300></a><h2>Old Ruralities: A Regret</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>With joy all relics of the past I hail;
<dt>The heath-bell, lingering in our cultured moor,
<dt>Or the dull sound of the slip-shouldered flail,
<dt>Still busy on the poor man's threshing floor:
<dt>I love this unshorn hedgerow, which survives
<dt>Its stunted neighbors, in this farming age:
<dt>The thatch and houseleek, where old Alice lives
<dt>With her old herbal, trusting every page;
<dt>I love the spinning wheel, which hums far down
<dt>In yon lone valley, though from day to day,
<dt>The boom of Science shakes it from the town.
<dt>Ah! Sweet old world! thou speedest fast away!
<dt>My boyhood's world! but all last looks are dear;
<dt>More touching is the deathbed than the bier!
</p>
<p>
<a name=400></a><h2>Letty's Globe: Or Some Irregularities in a First Lesson in Geography</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When Letty had scarce passed her third glad year,
<dt>And her young artless words began to flow,
<dt>One day we gave the child a colored sphere
<dt>Of the wide Earth, that she might mark and know,
<dt>By tint and outline, all its sea and land.
<dt>She patted all the world; old Empires peeped
<dt>Between her baby fingers; her soft hand
<dt>Was welcome at all frontiers. How she leaped,
<dt>And laughed and prattled in her world-wide bliss!
<dt>But when we turned her sweet unlearned eye
<dt>On our own Isle, she raised a joyous cry,--
<dt>"O yes! I see it, Letty's home is there!"
<dt>And while she hid all England with a kiss,
<dt>Bright over Europe fell her golden hair.
</p>
<a name=500></a><h2>Great Britain through the Ice: Or, Premature Patriotism</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Methought I lived in the icy times forlorn;
<dt>And, with a fond forecasting love and pride,
<dt>I hung o'er frozen England:--"When," I cried,
<dt>When will the island of our hopes be born?
<dt>When will our fields be seen, our church bells heard?
<dt>And Avon, Doon, and Tweed break out in song?
<dt>This blank unstoried ice be warmed and stirred,
<dt>And Thames, and Clyde, and Humber roll along
<dt>To a free sea-board? airs of paradise
<dt>Install our summer and our flowery springs,
<dt>And lift the larks, and our land the nightingales?
<dt>And this wild alien unfamiliar Wales
<dt>Melt home among her harps? and vernal skies
<dt>Thaw out old Dover for the houseless kings?"
</p>
<p>
<a name=600></a><h2>The Seaside: In and out of Season</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In summertime it was a paradise
<dt>Of mountain, frith, and bay, and shining sand;
<dt>Our outward rowers sang towards the land,
<dt>Followed by waving hands and happy cries:
<dt>By the full flood the groups no longer roam;
<dt>And when, at ebb, the glistening beach grows wide,
<dt>No barefoot children race into the foam,
<dt>But passive jellies wait the turn of tide.
<dt>Like some forsaken lover, lingering there,
<dt>The boatman stands; the maidens trip no more
<dt>With loosened locks; far from the billows' roar
<dt>The Mauds and Maries knot their tresses fair,
<dt>Where not a foam-flake from th' enamored shore
<dt>Comes down the sea-wind on the golden hair.
</p>
<p>
<a name=700></a><h2>Mary Queen of Scots</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When the young hand of Darnley locked in hers
<dt>Had knit her to her northern doom--amid
<dt>The spousal pomp of flags and trumpeters,
<dt>Her fate looked forth and was no longer hid;
<dt>A jealous brain beneath a southern crown
<dt>Wrought spells upon her; from afar she felt
<dt>The waxen image of her fortunes melt
<dt>Beneath the Tudor's eye, while the grim frown
<dt>Of her own lords o'ermastered her sweet smiles,
<dt>And nipped her growing gladness, till she mourned,
<dt>And sank, at last, beneath their cruel wiles;
<dt>But, ever since, all generous hearts have burned
<dt>To clear her fame, yes, very babes have yearned
<dt>Over this saddest story of the isles.

<p>
<h3>With the Straw Carrier</h3>
<p>
<dt>Flush with the pond the lurid furnace burned
<dt>At eve, while smoke and vapor filled the yard;
<dt>The gloomy winter sky was dimly starred,
<dt>The fly-wheel with a mellow murmur turned;
<dt>While, ever rising on its mystic stair
<dt>In the dim light, from secret chambers borne,
<dt>The straw of harvest, severed from the corn,
<dt>Climbed, and fell over, in the murky air.
<dt>I thought of mind and matter, will and law,
<dt>And then of him, who set his stately seal
<dt>Of Roman words on all the forms he saw
<dt>Of old-world husbandry; <i>I</i> could but feel
<dt>With what a rich precision <i>he</i> would draw
<dt>The endless ladder, and the booming wheel!

<p>
<dt>Did any seer of ancient time forbode
<dt>This mighty engine, which we daily see
<dt>Accepting our full harvests, like a god,
<dt>With clouds about his shoulders--it might be
<dt>Some poet-husbandman, some lord of verse,
<dt>Old Hesiod, or the wizard Mantuan,
<dt>Who catalogued in rich hexameters
<dt>The rake, the roller, and the mystic <a href="#999">van</a>;
<dt>Or else some priest of Ceres, it might seem,
<dt>Who witnessed, as he trod the silent fane,
<dt>The notes and auguries of coming change,
<dt>Of other ministrants in shrine and grange--
<dt>The sweating statue, and her sacred <a href="#999">wain</a>
<dt>Low-booming with the prophecy of steam!
