<a name=011></a><h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>O Earth, that had so long in darkness lain,
<dt>Waiting and listening for the Voice that cried,
<dt>"Let there be light!"--on thy first eventide
<dt>What woe, what fear, wrung thy dumb soul with pain!
<dt>In darkling space down dropt the red sun, slain,
<dt>With all his banners drooping. Far and wide
<dt>Spread desolation's vast and blackening tide.
<dt>How couldst thou know that day would dawn again?
<dt>But the long hours wore on, till lo! pale gleams
<dt>Of faint, far glory lit the eastern skies,
<dt>Broadening and reddening till the sun's full beams
<dt>Broke in clear, golden splendour on thine eyes.
<dt>Darkness and brooding anguish were but dreams,
<dt>Lost in a trembling wonder of surprise!
<p>
<a name=012></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>Even so, O Life, all tremulous with woe,
<dt>Thou too didst cower when, without sound or jar,
<dt>From the high zenith sinking fast and far,
<dt>Thy sun went out of heaven! How couldst thou know
<dt>In that dark hour, that never tide could flow
<dt>So ebon-black, nor ever mountain-bar
<dt>Breast night so deep, without or moon or star,
<dt>But that the morning yet again must glow?
<dt>God never leaves thee in relentless dark.
<dt>Slowly the dawn on unbelieving eyes
<dt>Breaketh at last. Day brightens,--and, oh hark!
<dt>A flood of bird-song from the tender skies!
<dt>From storm and darkness thou hast found an ark,
<dt>Shut in with this great marvel of surprise!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Darkness</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Come, blessed Darkness, come and bring thy balm
<dt>For eyes grown weary of the garish Day!
<dt>Come with thy soft, slow steps, thy garments grey,
<dt>Thy veiling shadows, bearing in thy palm
<dt>The poppy-seeds of slumber, deep and calm!
<dt>Come with thy patient stars, whose far-off ray
<dt>Steals the hot fever of the soul away,
<dt>Thy stillness, sweeter than a chanted psalm!
<dt>O blessed Darkness, Day indeed is fair,
<dt>And Light is dear when Summer days are long,
<dt>And one by one the harvesters go by;
<dt>But so is rest sweet, and surcease from care,
<dt>And folded palms, and hush of evensong,
<dt>And all the unfathomed silence of the sky!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>To-morrow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<a name=031></a><h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>Mysterious One, inscrutable, unknown,
<dt>A silent Presence, with averted face,
<dt>Whose lineaments no mortal eye can trace,
<dt>And robes of trailing darkness round thee thrown,
<dt>Over the midnight hills thou comest alone!
<dt>What thou dost bring to me from farthest space,
<dt>What blessing or what ban, what dole, what grace,
<dt>I may not know. Thy secrets are thine own!
<dt>Yet, asking not for lightest word or sign
<dt>To tell me what the hidden fate may be,
<dt>Without a murmur, or a quickened breath,
<dt>Unshrinkingly I place my hand in thine,
<dt>And through the shadowy depths go forth with thee
<dt>To meet, as thou shalt lead, or life, or death!
<p>
<a name=032></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>Then, if I fear not thee, thou veil&eacute;d One,
<dt>Whose face I know not, why fear I to meet
<dt>Beyond the everlasting hills her feet
<dt>Who cometh when all Yesterdays are done?
<dt>Shall I, who have proved thee good, thy sister shun?
<dt>O thou To-morrow, who dost feel the beat
<dt>Of life's long, rhythmic pulses, strong and sweet,
<dt>In the far realm that hath no need of sun--
<dt>Thou who art fairer than the fair To-day
<dt>That I have held so dear, and loved so much--
<dt>When, slow descending from the hills divine,
<dt>Thou summonest me to join thee on thy way,
<dt>Let me not shrink nor tremble at thy touch,
<dt>Nor fear to break thy bread and drink thy wine!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>"O Earth, Art Not Thou Weary?"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O Earth! art thou not weary of thy graves?
<dt>Dear, patient Mother Earth, upon thy breast
<dt>How are they heaped from farthest east to west!
<dt>From the dim north, where wild the storm-wind raves
<dt>O'er the cold surge that chills the shore it laves,
<dt>To sunlit isles by softest seas caressed,
<dt>Where roses bloom alway and song-birds nest,
<dt>How thick they lie--like flecks upon the waves!
<dt>There is no mountain-top so far and high,
<dt>No desert so remote, no vale so deep,
<dt>No spot by man so long untenanted,
<dt>But the pale moon, slow marching up the sky,
<dt>Sees over some lone grave the shadows creep!
<dt>O Earth! art thou not weary of thy dead?
