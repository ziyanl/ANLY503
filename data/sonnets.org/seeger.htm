<h1>Thirty Sonnets</h1>
<a name=001></a><h2>Sonnet I</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Down the strait vistas where a city street
<dt>Fades in pale dust and vaporous distances,
<dt>Stained with far fumes the light grows less and less
<dt>And the sky reddens round the day's retreat.
<dt>Now out of orient chambers, cool and sweet,
<dt>Like Nature's pure lustration, Dusk comes down.
<dt>Now the lamps brighten and the quickening town
<dt>Rings with the trample of returning feet.
<dt>And Pleasure, risen from her own warm mould
<dt>Sunk all the drowsy and unloved daylight
<dt>In layers of odorous softness, Paphian girls
<dt>Cover with gauze, with satin, and with pearls,
<dt>Crown, and about her spangly vestments fold
<dt>The ermine of the empire of the Night.
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>Sonnet II</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Her courts are by the flux of flaming ways,
<dt>Between the rivers and the illumined sky
<dt>Whose fervid depths reverberate from on high
<dt>Fierce lustres mingled in a fiery haze.
<dt>They mark it inland; blithe and fair of face
<dt>Her suitors follow, guessing by the glare
<dt>Beyond the hilltops in the evening air
<dt>How bright the cressets at her portals blaze.
<dt>On the pure fronts Defeat ere many a day
<dt>Falls like the soot and dirt on city-snow;
<dt>There hopes deferred lie sunk in piteous seams.
<dt>Her paths are disillusion and decay,
<dt>With ruins piled and unapparent woe,
<dt>The graves of Beauty and the wreck of dreams.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>Sonnet III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There was a youth around whose early way
<dt>White angels hung in converse and sweet choir,
<dt>Teaching in summer clouds his thought to stray, --
<dt>In cloud and far horizon to desire.
<dt>His life was nursed in beauty, like the stream
<dt>Born of clear showers and the mountain dew,
<dt>Close under snow-clad summits where they gleam
<dt>Forever pure against heaven's orient blue.
<dt>Within the city's shades he walked at last.
<dt>Faint and more faint in sad recessional
<dt>Down the dim corridors of Time outworn,
<dt>A chorus ebbed from that forsaken past,
<dt>A hymn of glories fled beyond recall
<dt>With the lost heights and splendor of life's morn.
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>Sonnet IV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Up at his attic sill the South wind came
<dt>And days of sun and storm but never peace.
<dt>Along the town's tumultuous arteries
<dt>He heard the heart-throbs of a sentient frame:
<dt>Each night the whistles in the bay, the same
<dt>Whirl of incessant wheels and clanging cars:
<dt>For smoke that half obscured, the circling stars
<dt>Burnt like his youth with but a sickly flame.
<dt>Up to his attic came the city cries --
<dt>The throes with which her iron sinews heave --
<dt>And yet forever behind prison doors
<dt>Welled in his heart and trembled in his eyes
<dt>The light that hangs on desert hills at eve
<dt>And tints the sea on solitary shores. . . .
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>Sonnet V</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A tide of beauty with returning May
<dt>Floods the fair city; from warm pavements fume
<dt>Odors endeared; down avenues in bloom
<dt>The chestnut-trees with phallic spires are gay.
<dt>Over the terrace flows the thronged cafe;
<dt>The boulevards are streams of hurrying sound;
<dt>And through the streets, like veins when they abound,
<dt>The lust for pleasure throbs itself away.
<dt>Here let me live, here let me still pursue
<dt>Phantoms of bliss that beckon and recede, --
<dt>Thy strange allurements, City that I love,
<dt>Maze of romance, where I have followed too
<dt>The dream Youth treasures of its dearest need
<dt>And stars beyond thy towers bring tidings of.
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>Sonnet VI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Give me the treble of thy horns and hoofs,
<dt>The ponderous undertones of 'bus and tram,
<dt>A garret and a glimpse across the roofs
<dt>Of clouds blown eastward over Notre Dame,
<dt>The glad-eyed streets and radiant gatherings
<dt>Where I drank deep the bliss of being young,
<dt>The strife and sweet potential flux of things
<dt>I sought Youth's dream of happiness among!
<dt>It walks here aureoled with the city-light,
<dt>Forever through the myriad-featured mass
<dt>Flaunting not far its fugitive embrace, --
<dt>Heard sometimes in a song across the night,
<dt>Caught in a perfume from the crowds that pass,
<dt>And when love yields to love seen face to face.
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>Sonnet VII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>To me, a pilgrim on that journey bound
<dt>Whose stations Beauty's bright examples are,
<dt>As of a silken city famed afar
<dt>Over the sands for wealth and holy ground,
<dt>Came the report of one -- a woman crowned
<dt>With all perfection, blemishless and high,
<dt>As the full moon amid the moonlit sky,
<dt>With the world's praise and wonder clad around.
<dt>And I who held this notion of success:
<dt>To leave no form of Nature's loveliness
<dt>Unworshipped, if glad eyes have access there, --
<dt>Beyond all earthly bounds have made my goal
<dt>To find where that sweet shrine is and extol
<dt>The hand that triumphed in a work so fair.
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>Sonnet VIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oft as by chance, a little while apart
<dt>The pall of empty, loveless hours withdrawn,
<dt>Sweet Beauty, opening on the impoverished heart,
<dt>Beams like the jewel on the breast of dawn:
<dt>Not though high heaven should rend would deeper awe
<dt>Fill me than penetrates my spirit thus,
<dt>Nor all those signs the Patmian prophet saw
<dt>Seem a new heaven and earth so marvelous;
<dt>But, clad thenceforth in iridescent dyes,
<dt>The fair world glistens, and in after days
<dt>The memory of kind lips and laughing eyes
<dt>Lives in my step and lightens all my face, --
<dt>So they who found the Earthly Paradise
<dt>Still breathed, returned, of that sweet, joyful place.
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>Sonnet IX</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Amid the florid multitude her face
<dt>Was like the full moon seen behind the lace
<dt>Of orchard boughs where clouded blossoms part
<dt>When Spring shines in the world and in the heart.
<dt>As the full-moon-beams to the ferny floor
<dt>Of summer woods through flower and foliage pour,
<dt>So to my being's innermost recess
<dt>Flooded the light of so much loveliness;
<dt>She held as in a vase of priceless ware
<dt>The wine that over arid ways and bare
<dt>My youth was the pathetic thirsting for,
<dt>And where she moved the veil of Nature grew
<dt>Diaphanous and that radiance mantled through
<dt>Which, when I see, I tremble and adore.
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>Sonnet X</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A splendor, flamelike, born to be pursued,
<dt>With palms extent for amorous charity
<dt>And eyes incensed with love for all they see,
<dt>A wonder more to be adored than wooed,
<dt>On whom the grace of conscious womanhood
<dt>Adorning every little thing she does
<dt>Sits like enchantment, making glorious
<dt>A careless pose, a casual attitude;
<dt>Around her lovely shoulders mantle-wise
<dt>Hath come the realm of those old fabulous queens
<dt>Whose storied loves are Art's rich heritage,
<dt>To keep alive in this our latter age
<dt>That force that moving through sweet Beauty's means
<dt>Lifts up Man's soul to towering enterprise.
<p>
<a name=011></a><h2>Sonnet XI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3> * A paraphrase of Petrarca, `Quando fra l'altre donne . . .'</h3>
<p>
<dt>When among creatures fair of countenance
<dt>Love comes enformed in such proud character,
<dt>So far as other beauty yields to her,
<dt>So far the breast with fiercer longing pants;
<dt>I bless the spot, and hour, and circumstance,
<dt>That wed desire to a thing so high,
<dt>And say, Glad soul, rejoice, for thou and I
<dt>Of bliss unpaired are made participants;
<dt>Hence have come ardent thoughts and waking dreams
<dt>That, feeding Fancy from so sweet a cup,
<dt>Leave it no lust for gross imaginings.
<dt>Through her the woman's perfect beauty gleams
<dt>That while it gazes lifts the spirit up
<dt>To that high source from which all beauty springs.
<p>
<a name=012></a><h2>Sonnet XII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Like as a dryad, from her native bole
<dt>Coming at dusk, when the dim stars emerge,
<dt>To a slow river at whose silent verge
<dt>Tall poplars tremble and deep grasses roll,
<dt>Come thou no less and, kneeling in a shoal
<dt>Of the freaked flag and meadow buttercup,
<dt>Bend till thine image from the pool beam up
<dt>Arched with blue heaven like an aureole.
<dt>See how adorable in fancy then
<dt>Lives the fair face it mirrors even so,
<dt>O thou whose beauty moving among men
<dt>Is like the wind's way on the woods below,
<dt>Filling all nature where its pathway lies
<dt>With arms that supplicate and trembling sighs.
<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>Sonnet XIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I fancied, while you stood conversing there,
<dt>Superb, in every attitude a queen,
<dt>Her ermine thus Boadicea bare,
<dt>So moved amid the multitude Faustine.
<dt>My life, whose whole religion Beauty is,
<dt>Be charged with sin if ever before yours
<dt>A lesser feeling crossed my mind than his
<dt>Who owning grandeur marvels and adores.
<dt>Nay, rather in my dream-world's ivory tower
<dt>I made your image the high pearly sill,
<dt>And mounting there in many a wistful hour,
<dt>Burdened with love, I trembled and was still,
<dt>Seeing discovered from that azure height
<dt>Remote, untrod horizons of delight.
<p>
<a name=014></a><h2>Sonnet XIV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It may be for the world of weeds and tares
<dt>And dearth in Nature of sweet Beauty's rose
<dt>That oft as Fortune from ten thousand shows
<dt>One from the train of Love's true courtiers
<dt>Straightway on him who gazes, unawares,
<dt>Deep wonder seizes and swift trembling grows,
<dt>Reft by that sight of purpose and repose,
<dt>Hardly its weight his fainting breast upbears.
<dt>Then on the soul from some ancestral place
<dt>Floods back remembrance of its heavenly birth,
<dt>When, in the light of that serener sphere,
<dt>It saw ideal beauty face to face
<dt>That through the forms of this our meaner Earth
<dt>Shines with a beam less steadfast and less clear.
<p>
<a name=015></a><h2>Sonnet XV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Above the ruin of God's holy place,
<dt>Where man-forsaken lay the bleeding rood,
<dt>Whose hands, when men had craved substantial food,
<dt>Gave not, nor folded when they cried, Embrace,
<dt>I saw exalted in the latter days
<dt>Her whom west winds with natal foam bedewed,
<dt>Wafted toward Cyprus, lily-breasted, nude,
<dt>Standing with arms out-stretched and flower-like face.
<dt>And, sick with all those centuries of tears
<dt>Shed in the penance for factitious woe,
<dt>Once more I saw the nations at her feet,
<dt>For Love shone in their eyes, and in their ears
<dt>Come unto me, Love beckoned them, for lo!
<dt>The breast your lips abjured is still as sweet.
<p>
<a name=016></a><h2>Sonnet XVI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Who shall invoke her, who shall be her priest,
<dt>With single rites the common debt to pay?
<dt>On some green headland fronting to the East
<dt>Our fairest boy shall kneel at break of day.
<dt>Naked, uplifting in a laden tray
<dt>New milk and honey and sweet-tinctured wine,
<dt>Not without twigs of clustering apple-spray
<dt>To wreath a garland for Our Lady's shrine.
<dt>The morning planet poised above the sea
<dt>Shall drop sweet influence through her drowsing lid;
<dt>Dew-drenched, his delicate virginity
<dt>Shall scarce disturb the flowers he kneels amid,
<dt>That, waked so lightly, shall lift up their eyes,
<dt>Cushion his knees, and nod between his thighs.
<p>
<a name=017></a><h2>Kyrenaikos</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lay me where soft Cyrene rambles down
<dt>In grove and garden to the sapphire sea;
<dt>Twine yellow roses for the drinker's crown;
<dt>Let music reach and fair heads circle me,
<dt>Watching blue ocean where the white sails steer
<dt>Fruit-laden forth or with the wares and news
<dt>Of merchant cities seek our harbors here,
<dt>Careless how Corinth fares, how Syracuse;
<dt>But here, with love and sleep in her caress,
<dt>Warm night shall sink and utterly persuade
<dt>The gentle doctrine Aristippus bare, --
<dt>Night-winds, and one whose white youth's loveliness,
<dt>In a flowered balcony beside me laid,
<dt>Dreams, with the starlight on her fragrant hair.
<p>
<a name=018></a><h2>Antinous</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Stretched on a sunny bank he lay at rest,
<dt>Ferns at his elbow, lilies round his knees,
<dt>With sweet flesh patterned where the cool turf pressed,
<dt>Flowerlike crept o'er with emerald aphides.
<dt>Single he couched there, to his circling flocks
<dt>Piping at times some happy shepherd's tune,
<dt>Nude, with the warm wind in his golden locks,
<dt>And arched with the blue Asian afternoon.
<dt>Past him, gorse-purpled, to the distant coast
<dt>Rolled the clear foothills.  There his white-walled town,
<dt>There, a blue band, the placid Euxine lay.
<dt>Beyond, on fields of azure light embossed
<dt>He watched from noon till dewy eve came down
<dt>The summer clouds pile up and fade away.
<p>
<a name=019></a><h2>Vivien</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Her eyes under their lashes were blue pools
<dt>Fringed round with lilies; her bright hair unfurled
<dt>Clothed her as sunshine clothes the summer world.
<dt>Her robes were gauzes -- gold and green and gules,
<dt>All furry things flocked round her, from her hand
<dt>Nibbling their foods and fawning at her feet.
<dt>Two peacocks watched her where she made her seat
<dt>Beside a fountain in Broceliande.
<dt>Sometimes she sang. . . .  Whoever heard forgot
<dt>Errand and aim, and knights at noontide here,
<dt>Riding from fabulous gestes beyond the seas,
<dt>Would follow, tranced, and seek . . . and find her not . . .
<dt>But wake that night, lost, by some woodland mere,
<dt>Powdered with stars and rimmed with silent trees.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>I Loved . . . </h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I loved illustrious cities and the crowds
<dt>That eddy through their incandescent nights.
<dt>I loved remote horizons with far clouds
<dt>Girdled, and fringed about with snowy heights.
<dt>I loved fair women, their sweet, conscious ways
<dt>Of wearing among hands that covet and plead
<dt>The rose ablossom at the rainbow's base
<dt>That bounds the world's desire and all its need.
<dt>Nature I worshipped, whose fecundity
<dt>Embraces every vision the most fair,
<dt>Of perfect benediction.  From a boy
<dt>I gloated on existence.  Earth to me
<dt>Seemed all-sufficient and my sojourn there
<dt>One trembling opportunity for joy.
<p>
<a name=021></a><h2>Virginibus Puerisque . . .</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I care not that one listen if he lives
<dt>For aught but life's romance, nor puts above
<dt>All life's necessities the need to love,
<dt>Nor counts his greatest wealth what Beauty gives.
<dt>But sometime on an afternoon in spring,
<dt>When dandelions dot the fields with gold,
<dt>And under rustling shade a few weeks old
<dt>'Tis sweet to stroll and hear the bluebirds sing,
<dt>Do you, blond head, whom beauty and the power
<dt>Of being young and winsome have prepared
<dt>For life's last privilege that really pays,
<dt>Make the companion of an idle hour
<dt>These relics of the time when I too fared
<dt>Across the sweet fifth lustrum of my days.
<p>
<a name=022></a><h2>With a Copy of Shakespeare's Sonnets on Leaving College</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As one of some fat tillage dispossessed,
<dt>Weighing the yield of these four faded years,
<dt>If any ask what fruit seems loveliest,
<dt>What lasting gold among the garnered ears, --
<dt>Ah, then I'll say what hours I had of thine,
<dt>Therein I reaped Time's richest revenue,
<dt>Read in thy text the sense of David's line,
<dt>Through thee achieved the love that Shakespeare knew.
<dt>Take then his book, laden with mine own love
<dt>As flowers made sweeter by deep-drunken rain,
<dt>That when years sunder and between us move
<dt>Wide waters, and less kindly bonds constrain,
<dt>Thou may'st turn here, dear boy, and reading see
<dt>Some part of what thy friend once felt for thee.
<p>
<a name=023></a><h2>Written in a Volume of the Comtesse de Noailles</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Be my companion under cool arcades
<dt>That frame some drowsy street and dazzling square
<dt>Beyond whose flowers and palm-tree promenades
<dt>White belfries burn in the blue tropic air.
<dt>Lie near me in dim forests where the croon
<dt>Of wood-doves sounds and moss-banked water flows,
<dt>Or musing late till the midsummer moon
<dt>Breaks through some ruined abbey's empty rose.
<dt>Sweetest of those to-day whose pious hands
<dt>Tend the sequestered altar of Romance,
<dt>Where fewer offerings burn, and fewer kneel,
<dt>Pour there your passionate beauty on my heart,
<dt>And, gladdening such solitudes, impart
<dt>How sweet the fellowship of those who feel!
<p>
<a name=024></a><h2>Coucy</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The rooks aclamor when one enters here
<dt>Startle the empty towers far overhead;
<dt>Through gaping walls the summer fields appear,
<dt>Green, tan, or, poppy-mingled, tinged with red.
<dt>The courts where revel rang deep grass and moss
<dt>Cover, and tangled vines have overgrown
<dt>The gate where banners blazoned with a cross
<dt>Rolled forth to toss round Tyre and Ascalon.
<dt>Decay consumes it.  The old causes fade.
<dt>And fretting for the contest many a heart
<dt>Waits their Tyrtaeus to chant on the new.
<dt>Oh, pass him by who, in this haunted shade
<dt>Musing enthralled, has only this much art,
<dt>To love the things the birds and flowers love too.
<p>
<a name=025></a><h2>Tezcotzinco</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Though thou art now a ruin bare and cold,
<dt>Thou wert sometime the garden of a king.
<dt>The birds have sought a lovelier place to sing.
<dt>The flowers are few.  It was not so of old.
<dt>It was not thus when hand in hand there strolled
<dt>Through arbors perfumed with undying Spring
<dt>Bare bodies beautiful, brown, glistening,
<dt>Decked with green plumes and rings of yellow gold.
<dt>Do you suppose the herdsman sometimes hears
<dt>Vague echoes borne beneath the moon's pale ray
<dt>From those old, old, far-off, forgotten years?
<dt>Who knows?  Here where his ancient kings held sway
<dt>He stands.  Their names are strangers to his ears.
<dt>Even their memory has passed away.
<p>
<a name=026></a><h2>The Old Lowe House, Staten Island</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Another prospect pleased the builder's eye,
<dt>And Fashion tenanted (where Fashion wanes)
<dt>Here in the sorrowful suburban lanes
<dt>When first these gables rose against the sky.
<dt>Relic of a romantic taste gone by,
<dt>This stately monument alone remains,
<dt>Vacant, with lichened walls and window-panes
<dt>Blank as the windows of a skull.  But I,
<dt>On evenings when autumnal winds have stirred
<dt>In the porch-vines, to this gray oracle
<dt>Have laid a wondering ear and oft-times heard,
<dt>As from the hollow of a stranded shell,
<dt>Old voices echoing (or my fancy erred)
<dt>Things indistinct, but not insensible.
<p>
<a name=027></a><h2>Oneata</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A hilltop sought by every soothing breeze
<dt>That loves the melody of murmuring boughs,
<dt>Cool shades, green acreage, and antique house
<dt>Fronting the ocean and the dawn; than these
<dt>Old monks built never for the spirit's ease
<dt>Cloisters more calm -- not Cluny nor Clairvaux;
<dt>Sweet are the noises from the bay below,
<dt>And cuckoos calling in the tulip-trees.
<dt>Here, a yet empty suitor in thy train,
<dt>Beloved Poesy, great joy was mine
<dt>To while a listless spell of summer days,
<dt>Happier than hoarder in each evening's gain,
<dt>When evenings found me richer by one line,
<dt>One verse well turned, or serviceable phrase.

<p>
<dt>Tonight a shimmer of gold lies mantled o'er
<dt>Smooth lovely Ocean.  Through the lustrous gloom
<dt>A savor steals from linden trees in bloom
<dt>And gardens ranged at many a palace door.
<dt>Proud walls rise here, and, where the moonbeams pour
<dt>Their pale enchantment down the dim coast-line,
<dt>Terrace and lawn, trim hedge and flowering vine,
<dt>Crown with fair culture all the sounding shore.
<dt>How sweet, to such a place, on such a night,
<dt>From halls with beauty and festival a-glare,
<dt>To come distract and, stretched on the cool turf,
<dt>Yield to some fond, improbable delight,
<dt>While the moon, reddening, sinks, and all the air
<dt>Sighs with the muffled tumult of the surf!

<p>
<dt>A cloud has lowered that shall not soon pass o'er.
<dt>The world takes sides:  whether for impious aims
<dt>With Tyranny whose bloody toll enflames
<dt>A generous people to heroic war;
<dt>Whether with Freedom, stretched in her own gore,
<dt>Whose pleading hands and suppliant distress
<dt>Still offer hearts that thirst for Righteousness
<dt>A glorious cause to strike or perish for.
<dt>England, which side is thine?  Thou hast had sons
<dt>Would shrink not from the choice however grim,
<dt>Were Justice trampled on and Courage downed;
<dt>Which will they be -- cravens or champions?
<dt>Oh, if a doubt intrude, remember him
<dt>Whose death made Missolonghi holy ground.

<p>
<dt>I stood beside his sepulchre whose fame,
<dt>Hurled over Europe once on bolt and blast,
<dt>Now glows far off as storm-clouds overpast
<dt>Glow in the sunset flushed with glorious flame.
<dt>Has Nature marred his mould?  Can Art acclaim
<dt>No hero now, no man with whom men side
<dt>As with their hearts' high needs personified?
<dt>There are will say, One such our lips could name;
<dt>Columbia gave him birth.  Him Genius most
<dt>Gifted to rule.  Against the world's great man
<dt>Lift their low calumny and sneering cries
<dt>The Pharisaic multitude, the host
<dt>Of piddling slanderers whose little eyes
<dt>Know not what greatness is and never can.

<p>
<dt>Sidney, in whom the heyday of romance
<dt>Came to its precious and most perfect flower,
<dt>Whether you tourneyed with victorious lance
<dt>Or brought sweet roundelays to Stella's bower,
<dt>I give myself some credit for the way
<dt>I have kept clean of what enslaves and lowers,
<dt>Shunned the ideals of our present day
<dt>And studied those that were esteemed in yours;
<dt>For, turning from the mob that buys Success
<dt>By sacrificing all Life's better part,
<dt>Down the free roads of human happiness
<dt>I frolicked, poor of purse but light of heart,
<dt>And lived in strict devotion all along
<dt>To my three idols -- Love and Arms and Song.
<p>
<a name=032></a><h2>Sonnet II</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Not that I always struck the proper mean
<dt>Of what mankind must give for what they gain,
<dt>But, when I think of those whom dull routine
<dt>And the pursuit of cheerless toil enchain,
<dt>Who from their desk-chairs seeing a summer cloud
<dt>Race through blue heaven on its joyful course
<dt>Sigh sometimes for a life less cramped and bowed,
<dt>I think I might have done a great deal worse;
<dt>For I have ever gone untied and free,
<dt>The stars and my high thoughts for company;
<dt>Wet with the salt-spray and the mountain showers,
<dt>I have had the sense of space and amplitude,
<dt>And love in many places, silver-shoed,
<dt>Has come and scattered all my path with flowers.
<p>
<a name=033></a><h2>Sonnet III</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Why should you be astonished that my heart,
<dt>Plunged for so long in darkness and in dearth,
<dt>Should be revived by you, and stir and start
<dt>As by warm April now, reviving Earth?
<dt>I am the field of undulating grass
<dt>And you the gentle perfumed breath of Spring,
<dt>And all my lyric being, when you pass,
<dt>Is bowed and filled with sudden murmuring.
<dt>I asked you nothing and expected less,
<dt>But, with that deep, impassioned tenderness
<dt>Of one approaching what he most adores,
<dt>I only wished to lose a little space
<dt>All thought of my own life, and in its place
<dt>To live and dream and have my joy in yours.
<p>
<h1>To . . . in church</h1>
<a name=034></a><h2>Sonnet IV</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If I was drawn here from a distant place,
<dt>'Twas not to pray nor hear our friend's address,
<dt>But, gazing once more on your winsome face,
<dt>To worship there Ideal Loveliness.
<dt>On that pure shrine that has too long ignored
<dt>The gifts that once I brought so frequently
<dt>I lay this votive offering, to record
<dt>How sweet your quiet beauty seemed to me.
<dt>Enchanting girl, my faith is not a thing
<dt>By futile prayers and vapid psalm-singing
<dt>To vent in crowded nave and public pew.
<dt>My creed is simple:  that the world is fair,
<dt>And beauty the best thing to worship there,
<dt>And I confess it by adoring you.
<p>Biarritz, Sunday, March 26, 1916.
<p>
<a name=035></a><h2>Sonnet V</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Seeing you have not come with me, nor spent
<dt>This day's suggestive beauty as we ought,
<dt>I have gone forth alone and been content
<dt>To make you mistress only of my thought.
<dt>And I have blessed the fate that was so kind
<dt>In my life's agitations to include
<dt>This moment's refuge where my sense can find
<dt>Refreshment, and my soul beatitude.
<dt>Oh, be my gentle love a little while!
<dt>Walk with me sometimes.  Let me see you smile.
<dt>Watching some night under a wintry sky,
<dt>Before the charge, or on the bed of pain,
<dt>These blessed memories shall revive again
<dt>And be a power to cheer and fortify.
<p>
<a name=036></a><h2>Sonnet VI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oh, you are more desirable to me
<dt>Than all I staked in an impulsive hour,
<dt>Making my youth the sport of chance, to be
<dt>Blighted or torn in its most perfect flower;
<dt>For I think less of what that chance may bring
<dt>Than how, before returning into fire,
<dt>To make my dearest memory of the thing
<dt>That is but now my ultimate desire.
<dt>And in old times I should have prayed to her
<dt>Whose haunt the groves of windy Cyprus were,
<dt>To prosper me and crown with good success
<dt>My will to make of you the rose-twined bowl
<dt>From whose inebriating brim my soul
<dt>Shall drink its last of earthly happiness.
<p>
<a name=037></a><h2>Sonnet VII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There have been times when I could storm and plead,
<dt>But you shall never hear me supplicate.
<dt>These long months that have magnified my need
<dt>Have made my asking less importunate,
<dt>For now small favors seem to me so great
<dt>That not the courteous lovers of old time
<dt>Were more content to rule themselves and wait,
<dt>Easing desire with discourse and sweet rhyme.
<dt>Nay, be capricious, willful; have no fear
<dt>To wound me with unkindness done or said,
<dt>Lest mutual devotion make too dear
<dt>My life that hangs by a so slender thread,
<dt>And happy love unnerve me before May
<dt>For that stern part that I have yet to play.
<p>
<a name=038></a><h2>Sonnet VIII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oh, love of woman, you are known to be
<dt>A passion sent to plague the hearts of men;
<dt>For every one you bring felicity
<dt>Bringing rebuffs and wretchedness to ten.
<dt>I have been oft where human life sold cheap
<dt>And seen men's brains spilled out about their ears
<dt>And yet that never cost me any sleep;
<dt>I lived untroubled and I shed no tears.
<dt>Fools prate how war is an atrocious thing;
<dt>I always knew that nothing it implied
<dt>Equalled the agony of suffering
<dt>Of him who loves and loves unsatisfied.
<dt>War is a refuge to a heart like this;
<dt>Love only tells it what true torture is.
<p>
<a name=039></a><h2>Sonnet IX</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Well, seeing I have no hope, then let us part;
<dt>Having long taught my flesh to master fear,
<dt>I should have learned by now to rule my heart,
<dt>Although, Heaven knows, 'tis not so easy near.
<dt>Oh, you were made to make men miserable
<dt>And torture those who would have joy in you,
<dt>But I, who could have loved you, dear, so well,
<dt>Take pride in being a good loser too;
<dt>And it has not been wholly unsuccess,
<dt>For I have rescued from forgetfulness
<dt>Some moments of this precious time that flies,
<dt>Adding to my past wealth of memory
<dt>The pretty way you once looked up at me,
<dt>Your low, sweet voice, your smile, and your dear eyes.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Sonnet X</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I have sought Happiness, but it has been
<dt>A lovely rainbow, baffling all pursuit,
<dt>And tasted Pleasure, but it was a fruit
<dt>More fair of outward hue than sweet within.
<dt>Renouncing both, a flake in the ferment
<dt>Of battling hosts that conquer or recoil,
<dt>There only, chastened by fatigue and toil,
<dt>I knew what came the nearest to content.
<dt>For there at least my troubled flesh was free
<dt>From the gadfly Desire that plagued it so;
<dt>Discord and Strife were what I used to know,
<dt>Heartaches, deception, murderous jealousy;
<dt>By War transported far from all of these,
<dt>Amid the clash of arms I was at peace.
<p>
<h1>On Returning to the Front after Leave</h1> 
<a name=041></a><h2>Sonnet XI</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Apart sweet women (for whom Heaven be blessed),
<dt>Comrades, you cannot think how thin and blue
<dt>Look the leftovers of mankind that rest,
<dt>Now that the cream has been skimmed off in you.
<dt>War has its horrors, but has this of good --
<dt>That its sure processes sort out and bind
<dt>Brave hearts in one intrepid brotherhood
<dt>And leave the shams and imbeciles behind.
<dt>Now turn we joyful to the great attacks,
<dt>Not only that we face in a fair field
<dt>Our valiant foe and all his deadly tools,
<dt>But also that we turn disdainful backs
<dt>On that poor world we scorn yet die to shield --
<dt>That world of cowards, hypocrites, and fools.
<p>
<a name=042></a><h2>Sonnet XII</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Clouds rosy-tinted in the setting sun,
<dt>Depths of the azure eastern sky between,
<dt>Plains where the poplar-bordered highways run,
<dt>Patched with a hundred tints of brown and green, --
<dt>Beauty of Earth, when in thy harmonies
<dt>The cannon's note has ceased to be a part,
<dt>I shall return once more and bring to these
<dt>The worship of an undivided heart.
<dt>Of those sweet potentialities that wait
<dt>For my heart's deep desire to fecundate
<dt>I shall resume the search, if Fortune grants;
<dt>And the great cities of the world shall yet
<dt>Be golden frames for me in which to set
<dt>New masterpieces of more rare romance.
<p>
<h2>Bellinglise</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<a name=043></a><h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>Deep in the sloping forest that surrounds
<dt>The head of a green valley that I know,
<dt>Spread the fair gardens and ancestral grounds
<dt>Of Bellinglise, the beautiful chateau.
<dt>Through shady groves and fields of unmown grass,
<dt>It was my joy to come at dusk and see,
<dt>Filling a little pond's untroubled glass,
<dt>Its antique towers and mouldering masonry.
<dt>Oh, should I fall to-morrow, lay me here,
<dt>That o'er my tomb, with each reviving year,
<dt>Wood-flowers may blossom and the wood-doves croon;
<dt>And lovers by that unrecorded place,
<dt>Passing, may pause, and cling a little space,
<dt>Close-bosomed, at the rising of the moon.
<p>
<a name=044></a><h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt>Here, where in happier times the huntsman's horn
<dt>Echoing from far made sweet midsummer eves,
<dt>Now serried cannon thunder night and morn,
<dt>Tearing with iron the greenwood's tender leaves.
<dt>Yet has sweet Spring no particle withdrawn
<dt>Of her old bounty; still the song-birds hail,
<dt>Even through our fusillade, delightful Dawn;
<dt>Even in our wire bloom lilies of the vale.
<dt>You who love flowers, take these; their fragile bells
<dt>Have trembled with the shock of volleyed shells,
<dt>And in black nights when stealthy foes advance
<dt>They have been lit by the pale rockets' glow
<dt>That o'er scarred fields and ancient towns laid low
<dt>Trace in white fire the brave frontiers of France.
<p>May 22, 1916.
