<p>"Prof. Boyesen is a Norwegian by birth, but is now an American citizen. His verse, if I am not mistaken, has not been collected in a volume. As a romancist he is almost as well known on the eastern as on the western side of the Atlantic." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#sharp">Sharp</a>) 
<p>"A native of Norway, born in 1848, he is well-known as a 
college professor, first at Cornell University and now at Columbia College, as 
well as a lecturer and writer on literary and social subjects.&nbsp; He is 
especially well-schooled in German and Scandinavian literature.&nbsp; Poems,

<a name="010"></a><h2>If the Rose Could Speak</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Within the rose I found a trembling tear,
<dt>Close curtained in a gloom of crimson night
<dt>By tender petals from the outer light,
<dt>I plucked the flower and held it to my ear,
<dt>And thought within its fervid breast to hear
<dt>A smothered heart-beat throbbing soft and low.
<dt>I heard its busy life-blood gently flow,
<dt>Now far away and now so strangely near.
<dt>Ah, thought I, if these silent lips of flame
<dt>Could be unsealed and fling into the air
<dt>Their woe, their passion, and in speech proclaim
<dt>Their warm intoxication of despair;--
<dt>Then would I give the rose into thy hand;
<dt>Thou couldst its voice, beloved, not withstand.
<p>
<a name="020"></a><h2>Thy Wondrous Name</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>How can I lightly speak thy wondrous name,
<dt>Which breathes the airy fragrance of thyself,
<dt>As might, far straying from his flower, the elf
<dt>Hold yet a breath within his fragile frame
<dt>Of the flower's soul, betraying whence he came?
<dt>I too, beloved, though we stray apart,
<dt>Since in the vestal temple of thy heart
<dt>I dwell secure, glow with a sacred flame.
<dt>A breath of thy sweet self unto me clings--
<dt>A wondrous voice, as of large unborn deeds,
<dt>With deep resoundings, through my being rings,
<dt>And unto wider realms of vision leads.
<dt>And dead to me are sorrow, doubt, and pain;
<dt>The slumbering god within me wakes again.

<h2><a name="evolution"></a>
Evolution</h2>        
<dt>      
I am the child of earth and air and sea,        
<dt>      
My lullaby by hoarse Silurian storms        
<dt>      
Was chanted; and through endless changing forms        
<dt>      
Of plant and bird and beast unceasingly        
<dt>      
The toiling ages wrought to fashion me.        
<dt>      
Lo, these large ancestors have left a breath        
<dt>      
Of their strong souls in mine, defying death        
<dt>      
And      
doom.&nbsp; I grow and blossom as the tree,        
<dt>      
                
<dt>      
And ever feel&nbsp;deep-delving, earthy roots        
<dt>      
Binding me daily to the common clay;        
<dt>      
But with its airy impulse upward shoots        
<dt>      
My life into the realms of light and day.        
<dt>      
And though, O Sea, stern mother of my soul,        
<dt>      
Thy tempests sing in me, thy billows&nbsp;roll!        
<dt>
<h2><a name="lily"></a>The Lily</h2>        
<dt>      
I saw the lily pale and perfect grow        
<dt>      
Amid &nbsp;its silent sisters in the mead.        
<dt>      
Methought within its chilly depth to read        
<dt>      
A maidenly severity, as though        
<dt>      
A cool young life lay slumbering in the snow        
<dt>      
Of its frail substance.&nbsp; In that chalice white,        
<dt>      
Whose fairy texture shone against the light,        
<dt>      
An unwakened pulse beat faint and slow.        
<dt>      
              
<dt>      
And I remembered, love, thy coy disdain,        
<dt>      
When thou my love for thee hadst first divined;        
<dt>      
  Thy proud, shy tenderness,—too proud to feign        
<dt>      
 That willful blindness which is yet not blind.        
<dt>      
 Then toward the sun thy lily-life I turned,—        
<dt>      
  With sudden splendor flushed its chalice burned.        
<dt>
<h2><a name="prescience"></a>Prescience of Death</h2>      
                
<dt>      
&nbsp;I wonder oft why God, who is so good,        
<dt>      
Has      
barred so close, so close the gates of death.        
<dt>      
  I stand and listen with suspended breath        
<dt>      
 While night and silence round about me brood,        
<dt>      
   If then, perchance, some spirit-whisper would        
<dt>      
  Grow audible and pierce my torpid sense.        
<dt>      
 And oft I feel a presence, veiled intense,        
<dt>      
   That pulses softly through the solitude;        
<dt>      
                
<dt>      
But as my soul leaps quivering to my ear        
<dt>      
 To grasp the potent message, all takes flight,        
<dt>      
And from the fields and woods I only hear        
<dt>      
  The murmurous chorus of the summer night.        
<dt>      
I am as on that's dead,—yet in his gloom        
<dt>      
 Feels faintly song of birds above his tomb.        
<dt>      
        &nbsp;
