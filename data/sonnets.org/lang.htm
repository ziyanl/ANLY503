<a name=010></a><h2>The Odyssey</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As one that for a weary space has lain
<dt>Lulled by the song of Circe and her wine
<dt>In gardens near the pale of Proserpine,
<dt>Where that AEaean isle forgets the main,
<dt>And only the low lutes of love complain,
<dt>And only shadows of wan lovers pine;
<dt>As such an one were glad to know the brine
<dt>Salt on his lips, and the large air again--
<dt>So gladly, from the songs of modern speech
<dt>Men turn, and see the stars, and feel the free
<dt>Shrill wind beyond the close of heavy flowers;
<dt>And, through the music of the languid hours,
<dt>They hear like ocean on a western beach
<dt>The surge and thunder of the Odyssey.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>To Izaak Walton</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Old Izaak, in this angry age of ours,
<dt>This hungry, angry age, how oft of thee
<dt>We dream, and thy divine tranquillity,
<dt>And all thy pleasure in the dewy flowers,
<dt>The meads enamelled, and the singing showers,
<dt>And shelter of the silvery willow-tree,
<dt>By quiet waters of the river Lea!
<dt>Ah, happy hours! we cry--ah, halcyon hours!
<dt>Yet thou, like we, hadst trouble for this realm
<dt>Of England: for thy dear Church mocked and rent,
<dt>Thy friends in beggary, thy monarch slain,
<dt>But naught could thy mild spirit overwhelm.
<dt>Ah, Father Izaak, teach us thy content
<dt>When Time brings many a sorrow back again!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Homeric Unity</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The sacred keep of Ilion is rent
<dt>With shaft and pit; vague waters wander slow
<dt>Through plains where Simois and Scamander went
<dt>To war with gods and heroes long ago:
<dt>Not yet to dark Cassandra, lying low
<dt>In rich Mycen&aelig;, do the Fates relent;
<dt>The bones of Agamemnon are a show,
<dt>And ruined is his royal monument.
<p>
<dt>The awful dust and treasures of the Dead
<dt>Has Learning scattered wide; but vainly thee,
<dt>Homer, she measures with her Lesbian lead,
<dt>And strives to rend thy songs: too blind is she
<dt>To know the crown on thine immortal head
<dt>Of indivisible supremacy.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Colonel Burnaby</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou that on every field of earth and sky
<dt>Didst hunt for Death--that seemed to flee and fear--
<dt>How great and greatly fallen dost thou lie
<dt>Slain in the Desert by some wandering spear!
<dt>"Not here," alas! may England say--"not here
<dt>Nor in this quarrel was it meet to die,
<dt>But in that dreadful battle drawing nigh,
<dt>To shake the Afghan passes strait and sheer."
<p>
<dt>Like Aias by the Ships shouldst thou have stood,
<dt>And in some glen have stayed the stream of flight,
<dt>The pillar of thy people and their shield,
<dt>Till Helmund or till Indus ran with blood,
<dt>And back, towards the Northlands and the Night,
<dt>The stricken Eagles scattered from the field.
