<a name=010></a><h2>Immortality</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<h3><i>An Aspiration</i></h3>
<p>
<dt>And will the spirit falter and its fire
<dt>Burn low and slow, and die, when we grow old?
<dt>The brain be silent, and the heart be cold,
<dt>And love be old and cold, and all desire
<p>
<dt>Be quenched, that now higher and higher,
<dt>Immortal fire, through dungeon keep and hold,
<dt>Turret and spire of this proud life, is rolled--
<dt>Shall this grow cold and cold and then expire?
<p>
<dt>Oh let the dream live on, the mortal die,--
<dt>The vision thrive, the costly form decay,--
<dt>The beauty old and cold all pass away,
<dt>The spirit higher and higher, in fire uprolled,
<dt>Wrap tower and spire and battlement on high
<dt>And earth and sky, so that it ne'er grow old!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Soul</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Whence are these motions of the human soul?
<dt>Itself outside itself wanders and soars,
<dt>Alighting now from old Diluvian shores,
<dt>Or where the many-moon&eacute;d planets roll,
<p>
<dt>Or the fixed stars gaze round the icy pole,--
<dt>A moment on the threshold of itself
<dt>To stand, then hide, an unsubstantial elf,
<dt>Or, eyeless, burrow downward like a mole.
<p>
<dt>But all the while, as a still sentinel
<dt>Upon a lonely hill, it marks the track
<dt>Itself hath made, and hath the potent spell
<dt>Its absent self at will to summon back:--
<p>
<dt>So several it is, and yet so one,
<dt>Such diverse moods that move in unison!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Death of Love</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Love doth not stir my heart; sweet love is dead,
<dt>Its cheek is pale, its lovely eyelids closed;
<dt>No, not a quiver shakes the lowly bed
<dt>Where the dear ashen image lies reposed.
<p>
<dt>I can go nigh and lift the mournful veil,
<dt>I can look down and touch the chiselled lips,--
<dt>Remember that they were not always pale,
<dt>But red--ah, rosy-red--with smiles and quips.
<p>
<dt>I can do this, then pass with but a tear,
<dt>That tear soon taught to decorate a smile,
<dt>Mayhap adorn a verse to please an ear
<dt>That love's sweet music yet will help beguile.
<p>
<dt>Ah God! so dead to Love, and yet not dead!
<dt>Would I were with her on her lowly bed!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>An August Noon</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>High summer Noon! Yon crow of all his kind
<dt>Stands indefatigably impudent--
<dt>A vigilant scout upon a battlement
<dt>Of his vast fortress. Underneath him wind
<p>
<dt>The water-courses--open, unconfined
<dt>To his down-peering eye. Improvident
<dt>The bare fields lie in swart abandonment;
<dt>The hills their tresses thoughtlessly unbind
<p>
<dt>Of fluent silver, carelessly displayed;
<dt>And all the pastures in their morn attire
<dt>Of flowery robes most gorgeously arrayed
<dt>Shrink now too late beore the noonday's fire.
<p>
<dt>Thus unthrift Earth her dainty bosom bares,
<dt>And on her nakedness heaven's bold eye stares.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Beauty Evanescent</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Beside her I could be a thousand years
<dt>And talk with her, and muse, and think I caught
<dt>Her very spirit, and yet catch it not;
<dt>So subtle is it: Two translucent spheres
<p>
<dt>Should flash it forth; it flames, then disappears.
<dt>A mouth all music should translate it well;
<dt>It flows like music--whither none can tell;
<dt>It wraps all senses round, soothes, charms, and cheers.
<p>
<dt>And when we feel, peer, listen, would confine
<dt>And grasp its very self, it slips away,
<dt>Like the elusive beauty of a day
<dt>In autumn, leaving of its track no sign.
<p>
<dt>And yet the search we every day renew,
<dt>Pleased to be foiled, yet foiled, still to pursue.
