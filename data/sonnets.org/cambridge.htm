<p>
<dt>Me let the world disparage and despise --
<dt>As one unfettered with its gilded chains,
<dt>As one untempted by its sordid gains,
<dt>Its pleasant vice, its profitable lies;
<dt>Let Justice, blind and halt and maimed, chastise
<dt>The rebel spirit surging in my veins,
<dt>Let the Law deal me penalties and pains
<dt>And make me hideous in my neighbours' eyes.
<p>
<dt>But let me fall not in mine own esteem,
<dt>By poor deceit or selfish greed debased.
<dt>Let me be clean from secret stain and shame,
<dt>Know myself true, though false as hell I seem --
<dt>Know myself worthy, howsoe'er disgraced --
<dt>Know myself right, though every tongue should blame.  
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Despair</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Alone!  Alone!  No beacon, far or near!
<dt>No chart, no compass, and no anchor stay!
<dt>Like melting fog the mirage melts away
<dt>In all-surrounding darkness, void and clear.
<dt>Drifting, I spread vain hands, and vainly peer
<dt>And vainly call for pilot, -- weep and pray;
<dt>Beyond these limits not the faintest ray
<dt>Shows distant coast whereto the lost may steer.
<p>
<dt>O what is life, if we must hold it thus
<dt>As wind-blown sparks hold momentary fire?
<dt>What are these gifts without the larger boon?
<dt>O what is art, or wealth, or fame to us
<dt>Who scarce have time to know what we desire?
<dt>O what is love, if we must part so soon?  
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Faith</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>And is the great cause lost beyond recall?
<dt>Have all the hopes of ages come to naught?
<dt>Is life no more with noble meaning fraught?
<dt>Is life but death, and love its funeral pall?
<dt>Maybe.  And still on bended knees I fall,
<dt>Filled with a faith no preacher ever taught.
<dt>O God -- MY God -- by no false prophet wrought --
<dt>I believe still, in despite of it all!
<p>
<dt>Let go the myths and creeds of groping men.
<dt>This clay knows naught -- the Potter understands.
<dt>I own that Power divine beyond my ken,
<dt>And still can leave me in His shaping hands.
<dt>But, O my God, that madest me to feel,
<dt>Forgive the anguish of the turning wheel!
