<p>
<dt>See where the pilgrim bound for Mecca's shrine
<dt>Yon weary steps and way-worn robes proclaim,
<dt>Is not his pilgrimage akin to mine?
<dt>Is not our errand somewhat of the same?
<dt>For not even Mecca's venerated name
<dt>Nor yet Medina where the prophet lies,
<dt>Receives the homage, nor can boast the fame
<dt>Of those dim tombs that now before me rise.
<p>
<dt>Alas! proud city--and is this the sight
<dt>That first attracts the distant stranger's gaze?
<dt>Nor fort, nor palace, tells the Moslem's might;
<dt>Alone the giant tombs of other days,
<dt>Obscure and shadowy in the early light,
<dt>As clouds on the horizon he surveys.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Saracen</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>And where is he who, like a raging flame,
<dt>"The Koran or the sword!" his battlecry,
<dt>From Mecca's shores with conquering Amru came?
<dt>In his own city here of victory
<dt>One only bears a heavier yoke than he;
<dt>What can that faith do for him in his need?
<dt>It teaches him to bear adversity
<dt>With patience that may shame a better creed.
<p>
<dt>See what he is! To know what he has been,
<dt>Go! view the tombs--ye shall not see them long--
<dt>Where the old Caliphs sleep--or climb his strong
<dt>Old fortress on the rock, and view the scene
<dt>Spread at your feet, and ye may picture then
<dt>The ancient glory of the Saracen.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Heliopolis</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Art's infant home, and learning's earliest school,
<dt>The world's great college, mystic wisdom's shrine,
<dt>Seat of the king-priest's more than regal rule,
<dt>Fair city of the sun! and what of thine
<dt>Remains to tell how glorious, how divine
<dt>Thy temples rose? <a href="#999">one solitary stone</a>
<dt>Surviving, a memorial and a sign,
<dt>Still points to him for whom thy temples shone:
<p>
<dt>Pause here! it is holy ground whereon we stand--
<dt>The Virgin with her Offspring, when she fled
<dt>From Herod's fury, laid her weary head
<dt>Beneath <a href="#999">yon reverend tree</a>--with gentle hand,
<dt>Ah! touch these frail traditions--for they shed
<dt>A ray round many a spot that else were drear and dread.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Great Pyramid</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Yes! yon stern lines do but embody one,
<dt>One stern, unchanging, omnipresent thought
<dt>That dwelt a deadly incubus upon
<dt>The builder's soul, and in his nature wrought:
<dt>With giant efforts all his life he sought
<dt>To fling the fearful burden from his mind
<dt>And left, at last, in visible shape behind
<dt>Its type, this load, the heaviest ever brought
<dt>By man upon the weary earth to press
<dt>In this stupendous form is tangibly
<dt>That thought portrayed! Eternity--no less!
<dt>Eternity mistaken! Never ye
<dt>Who do not faith, surpassing faith possess,
<dt>No--never look into eternity!
