<a name="000"></a><p>From <a href="bibliogr.htm#sterner.htm">The Sonnet in American Literature</a>
<p>"In Washington Allston we come to a poet of more substantial merit [than previous American sonneteers], although it is doubtful if his best work was done in the sonnet form. <i>Sylphs of the Seasons</i>, Boston, 1813, contains six sonnets on topics suggested by his activities as an artist. <i>Lectures on Art and Poems</i>, 1850, contains these six and seven others. Allston's sonnets, although irregular in structure, are arresting by the simple dignity of their diction.
<p>He painted a picture of Coleridge, and had these lines written of him by <a href="southey.htm">Robert Southey</a> in <i>A Vision of Judgment</i>:
<p><blockquote>. . . he, who returning<br>
Rich in praise to his native shores, hath left a remembrance<br>
Long to be honored and loved on the banks of the Thames and the Tiber.</blockquote>
<p>Allston's best sonnet, perhaps, is the one he wrote on the death of Coleridge." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#sterner">Sterner</a>)

<p>
<dt>And thou art gone, most loved, most honoured friend!
<dt>No, never more thy gentle voice shall blend
<dt>With air of Earth its pure ideal tones,
<dt>Binding in one, as with harmonious zones,
<dt>The heart and intellect. And I no more
<dt>Shall with thee gaze on that unfathomed deep,
<dt>The Human Soul,—as when, pushed off the shore,
<dt>Thy mystic bark would through the darkness sweep,
<dt>Itself the while so bright! For oft we seemed
<dt>As on some starless sea,—all dark above,
<dt>All dark below,—yet, onward as we drove,
<dt>To plough up light that ever round us streamed.
<dt>But he who mourns is not as one bereft
<dt>Of all he loved: thy living Truths are left.

<p></p>
<dt>How vast, how dread, o'erwhelming, is the thought
<dt>Of space interminable! to the soul
<dt>A circling weight that crushes into naught
<dt>Her mighty faculties! a wondrous whole,
<dt>Without or parts, beginning, or an end!
<dt>How fearful, then, on desperate wings to send
<dt>The fancy e'en amid the waste profound!
<dt>Yet, born as if all daring to astound,
<dt>Thy giant hand, O Angelo, hath hurled
<dt>E'en human forms, with all their mortal weight,
<dt>Down the dread void,—fall endless as their fate!
<dt>Already now they seem from world to world
<dt>For ages thrown; yet doomed, another past,
<dt>Another still to reach, nor e'er to reach the last!
<p>

<p></p>
<dt>O, now I feel as though another sense,
<dt>From heaven descending, had informed my soul;
<dt>I feel the pleasurable, full control
<dt>Of Grace, harmonious, boundless, and intense.
<dt>In thee, celestial Group, embodied lives
<dt>The subtile mystery, that speaking gives
<dt>Itself resolved; the essences combined
<dt>Of Motion ceaseless, Unity complete.
<dt>Borne like a leaf by some soft eddying wind,
<dt>Mine eyes, impelled as by enchantment sweet,
<dt>From part to part with circling motion rove,
<dt>Yet seem unconscious of the power to move;
<dt>From line to line through endless changes run,
<dt>O'er countless shapes, yet seem to gaze on One.

<a name="003"></a><h2>On Seeing the Picture of Æolus by Pelligrino Tibaldi, in the Institute at Bologna</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Full well, Tibaldi, did thy kindred mind
<dt>The mighty spell of Buonarroti own.
<dt>Like one who, reading magic words, receives
<dt>The gift of intercourse with worlds unknown,
<dt>'T was thine, deciphering Nature's mystic leaves,
<dt>To hold strange converse with the viewless wind;
<dt>To see the Spirits, in embodied forms,
<dt>Of gales and whirlwinds, hurricanes and storms.
<dt>For, lo! obedient to thy bidding, teems
<dt>Fierce into shape their stern, relentless Lord:
<dt>His form of motion ever-restless seems;
<dt>Or, if to rest inclined his turbid soul,
<dt>On Hecla's top to stretch, and give the word
<dt>To subject Winds that sweep the desert pole.

<a name="004"></a><h2>On Rembrandt; Occasioned by His Picture of Jacob's Dream</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>As in that twilight, superstitious age
<dt>When all beyond the narrow grasp of mind
<dt>Seemed fraught with meanings of supernal kind,
<dt>When e'en the learned, philosophic sage,
<dt>Wont with the stars through boundless space to range,
<dt>Listened with reverence to the changeling's tale;—
<dt>E'en so, thou strangest of all beings strange!
<dt>E'en so thy visionary scenes I hail;
<dt>That, like the rambling of an idiot's speech,
<dt>No image giving of a thing on earth,
<dt>Nor thought significant in Reason's reach,
<dt>Yet in their random shadowings give birth
<dt>To thoughts and things from other worlds that come,
<dt>And fill the soul, and strike the reason dumb.

<p></p>
<dt>There is a charm no vulgar mind can reach,
<dt>No critic thwart, no mighty master teach;
<dt>A charm how mingled of the good and ill!
<dt>Yet still so mingled that the mystic whole
<dt>Shall captive hold the struggling gazer's will,
<dt>Till vanquished reason own its full control.
<dt>And such, O Rubens, thy mysterious art,
<dt>The charm that vexes, yet enslaves the heart!
<dt>Thy lawless style, from timid systems free,
<dt>Impetuous rolling like a troubled sea,
<dt>High o'er the rocks of reason's lofty verge
<dt>Impending hangs; yet, ere the foaming surge
<dt>Breaks o'er the bound, the refluent ebb of taste
<dt>Back from the shore impels the watery waste.

<p></p>
<dt>From one unused in pomp of words to raise
<dt>A courtly monument of empty praise,
<dt>Where self, transpiring through the flimsy pile,
<dt>Betrays the builder's ostentatious guile,
<dt>Accept, O West, these unaffected lays,
<dt>Which genius claims and grateful justice pays.
<dt>Still green in age, thy vigorous powers impart
<dt>The youthful freshness of a blameless heart:
<dt>For thine, unaided by another's pain,
<dt>The wiles of envy, or the sordid train
<dt>Of selfishness, has been the manly race
<dt>Of one who felt the purifying grace
<dt>Of honest fame; nor found the effort vain
<dt>E'en for itself to love thy soul-ennobling art.

<p></p>
<dt>The Earth has had her visitation. Like to this
<dt>She hath not known, save when the mounting waters
<dt>Made of her orb one universal ocean.
<dt>For now the Tree that grew in Paradise,
<dt>The deadly Tree that first gave Evil motion,
<dt>And sent its poison through Earth's sons and daughters,
<dt>Had struck again its root in every land;
<dt>And now its fruit was ripe,—about to fall,—
<dt>And now a mighty Kingdom raised the hand,
<dt>To pluck and eat. Then from his throne stepped forth
<dt>The King of Hell, and stood upon the Earth:
<dt>But not, as once, upon the Earth to crawl.
<dt>A Nation's congregated form he took,
<dt>Till, drunk with sin and blood, Earth to her centre shook.
<p>
<a name="007"></a><h2>Thought</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>What master-voice shall from the dim profound
<dt>Of Thought evoke its fearful, mighty Powers?—
<dt>Those dread enchanters, whose terrific call
<dt>May never be gainsaid; whose wondrous thrall
<dt>Alone the Infinite, the Uncreate, may bound;
<dt>In whose dark presence e'en the Reason cowers,
<dt>Lost in their mystery, e'en while her slaves,
<dt>Doing her proud behests. Ay, who to sense
<dt>Shall bring them forth?—those subtile Powers that wear
<dt>No shape their own, yet to the mind dispense
<dt>All shapes that be. Or who in deepest graves
<dt>Seal down the crime which they shall not uptear?—
<dt>Those fierce avengers, whom the murdered dead
<dt>Shall hear, and follow to the murderer's bed.
<p>
<a name="009"></a><h2>A Smile</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>A smile!—Alas, how oft the lips that bear
<dt>This floweret of the soul but give to air,
<dt>Like flowering graves, the growth of buried care!
<dt>Then drear indeed that miserable heart
<dt>Where this last human boon is aye denied!
<dt>If such there be, it claims in man no part,
<dt>Whose deepest grief has yet a mirthful bride.
<dt>For whose so many as the sad man's face?
<dt>His joy, though brief, is yet reprieve from woe;
<dt>The waters of his life in darkness flow;
<dt>Yet, when the accidents of time displace
<dt>The cares that vault their channel, and let in
<dt>A gleam of day, with what a joyous din
<dt>The stream jets out to catch the sunny grace!
<p>
<a name="010"></a><h2>Art</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>O Art, high gift of Heaven! how oft defamed
<dt>When seeming praised! To most a craft that fits,
<dt>By dead, prescriptive Rule, the scattered bits
<dt>Of gathered knowledge; even so misnamed
<dt>By some who would invoke thee; but not so
<dt>By him,—the noble Tuscan,*—who gave birth
<dt>To forms unseen of man, unknown to Earth,
<dt>Now living habitants; he felt the glow
<dt>Of thy revealing touch, that brought to view
<dt>The invisible Idea; and he knew,
<dt>E'en by his inward sense, its form was true:
<dt>'T was life to life responding, - highest truth!
<dt>So, through Elisha's faith, the Hebrew Youth
<dt>Beheld the thin blue air to fiery chariots grow.

<p></p>
<dt>Oh, who can look on that celestial face,
<dt>And kindred for it claim with aught on earth?
<dt>If ever here more lovely form had birth—
<dt>No—never that supernal purity—that grace
<dt>So eloquent of unimpassioned love!
<dt>That, by a simple movement, thus imparts
<dt>Its own harmonious peace, the while our hearts
<dt>Rise, as by instinct, to the world above.
<dt>And yet we look on cold, unconscious stone.
<dt>But what is <i>that</i> which thus our spirits own
<dt>As Truth and Life? 'Tis not material Art—
<dt>But e'en the Sculptor's soul to sense unseal'd.
<dt>Oh, never may he doubt—its witness so reveal'd—
<dt>There lives within him an immortal part.
