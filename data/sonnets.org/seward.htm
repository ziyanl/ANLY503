<p>
<dt>Behold that tree in autumn's dim decay,
<dt>Stripped by the frequent chill and eddying wind;
<dt>Where yet some yellow lonely leaves we find
<dt>Lingering and trembling on the naked spray,
<dt>Twenty, perchance, for millions whirled away!
<dt>Emblem--alas too just!--of human kind:
<dt>Vain man expects longevity, designed
<dt>For few indeed; and their protracted day--
<p>
<dt>What is it worth that wisdom does not scorn?
<dt>The blasts of sickness, care, and grief appal,
<dt>That laid the friends in dust, whose natal morn
<dt>Rose near their own!--and solemn is the call;
<dt>Yet, like those weak, deserted leaves forlorn,
<dt>Shivering they cling to life and fear to fall.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>To Mr. Henry Cary, on the Publication of His Sonnets</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Praised be the poet who the sonnet's claim,
<dt>Severest of the orders that belong
<dt>Distinct and separate to the Delphic song,
<dt>Shall venerate, nor its appropriate name
<dt>Lawless assume. Peculiar is its frame
<dt>From him derived who shunned the city throng
<dt>And warbled sweet thy rocks and streams among,
<dt>Lonely Valclusa!--
<dt>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;and that heir of fame,
<dt>Our greater Milton, hath by many a lay
<dt>Formed on that arduous model, fully shown
<dt>The English verse may happily display
<dt>Those strict energic measures, which alone
<dt>Deserve the name of sonnet, and convey
<dt>A grandeur, grace, and spirit all their own.

<a name=030></a><h2>On a Lock of Miss Sarah Seward's Hair, Who Died in Her Twentieth Year</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My angel sister, though thy lovely form
<dt>Perished in youth's gay morning, yet is mine
<dt>This precious ringlet!--still the soft hairs shine,
<dt>Still glow the nut-brown tints, all bright and warm
<dt>With sunny gleam!--Alas! each kindred charm
<dt>Vanished long since; deep in the silent shrine
<dt>Withered to shapeless dust!--and of their grace
<dt>Memory alone retains the faithful trace.--
<p>
<dt>Dear lock! had thy sweet owner lived, ere now
<dt>Time on her brow had faded thee!--My care
<dt>Screened from the sun and dew thy golden glow;
<dt>And thus her early beauty dost thou wear,
<dt>Thou all of that fair frame my love could save
<dt>From the resistless ravage of the grave!
