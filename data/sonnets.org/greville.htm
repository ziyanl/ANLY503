<p><a name=012></a><h2>"Cupid, thou naughty boy..."</h2>
<P>
<dt>Cupid, thou naughty boy, when thou wert loathed,
<dt>Naked and blind, for vagabonding noted,
<dt>Thy nakedness I in my reason clothed,
<dt>Mine eyes I gave thee, so was I devoted.</P>
<P>
<dt>Fie, wanton, fie! who would show children kindness?
<dt>No sooner he into mine eyes was gotten
<dt>But straight he clouds them with a seeing blindness,
<dt>Makes reason wish that reason were forgotten.</P>
<P>
<dt>From thence to Myra's eyes the wanton strayeth,
<dt>Where while I charge him with ungrateful measure,
<dt>So with fair wonders he mine eyes betrayeth,
<dt>That my wounds and his wrongs become my pleasure;
<dt>Till for more spite to Myra's heart he flyeth,
<dt>Where living to the world, to me he dieth.
</P>
<a name=016></a><h2>"Fie, foolish earth..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Fie, foolish earth, think you the heaven wants glory
<dt>Because your shadows do yourself benight?
<dt>All's dark unto the blind, let them be sorry;
<dt>But love still in herself finds her delight.</P>
<p>
<dt>Fie, fond desire, think you that love wants glory
<dt>Because your shadows do yourself benight?
<dt>The hopes and fears of lust may make men sorry,
<dt>The heavens in themselves are ever bright.</p>
<p>
<dt>Then earth, stand fast, the sky that you benight
<dt>Will turn again and so restore your glory;
<dt>Desire, be steady, hope is your delight,
<dt>An orb wherein no creature can be sorry,
<dt>Love being placed above these middle regions
<dt>Where every passion wars itself with legions.</p>
