<dt>Ambitious views never fired my lowly breast,
<dt>Contented competence to me a throne;
<dt>In some sequestered vale my head to rest
<dt>And on some kindred heart repose my own.
<dt>To share such toil as gives to ease its zest,
<dt>Such temperate mirth as wisdom's self might own;
<dt>A cot within with smiles and neatness dressed,
<dt>Without with fragrant woodbine overgrown.
<p>
<dt>Secure to please, the sweetest task confessed
<dt>The aim to please entirely, one alone;
<dt>With love and peace and union to be blessed,
<dt>By fashion's slaves unnoticed and unknown.
<dt>To have a little for the more distressed
<dt>And with kind deeds the want of wealth atone.
