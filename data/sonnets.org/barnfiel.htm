<p>
<dt>If music and sweet poetry agree,
<dt>As they must needs (the sister and the brother),
<dt>Then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me,
<dt>Because thou lov'st the one, and I the other.
<dt>Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch
<dt>Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
<dt>Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such
<dt>As, passing all conceit, needs no defence.
<dt>Thou lov'st to hear the sweet melodious sound
<dt>That Ph&oelig;bus' lute (the queen of music makes;
<dt>And I in deep delight am chiefly drowned
<dt>Whenas himself to singing he betakes.
<dt>One god is god of both (as poets feign),
<dt>One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Chaucer is dead; and Gower lies in grave;
<dt>The Earl of Surrey long ago is gone;
<dt>Sir Philip Sidney's soul the heavens have;
<dt>George Gascoigne him before was tombed in stone.
<dt>Yet, though their bodies lie full low in ground,
<dt>As every thing must die that erst was born,
<dt>Their living fame no fortune can confound,
<dt>Nor ever shall their labors be forlorn.
<dt>And you, that discommend sweet poetry,
<dt>(So that the subject of the same be good)
<dt>Here may you see your fond simplicity,
<dt>Sith kings have favored it, of royal blood.
<dt>The King of Scots (now living) is a poet,
<dt>As his <i>Lepanto</i> and his <i>Furies</i> show it.
<p>
<a name=111></a><h2>"Sighing, and sadly sitting by my love"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sighing, and sadly sitting by my love,
<dt>He asked the cause of my heart's sorrowing,
<dt>Conjuring me by heaven's eternal King
<dt>To tell the cause which me so much did move.
<dt>Compelled (quoth I), to thee will I confess,
<dt>Love is the cause, and only love it is
<dt>That doth deprive me of my heavenly bliss.
<dt>Love is the pain that doth my heart oppress.
<dt>And what is she (quoth he) whom thou dost love?
<dt>Look in this glass (quoth I), there shalt thou see
<dt>The perfect form of my felicity.
<dt>When, thinking that it would strange magic prove,
<dt>He opened it, and taking off the cover,
<dt>He straight perceived himself to be my lover.
<p>
<a name=117></a><h2>"Cherry-lipped Adonis..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Cherry-lipped Adonis in his snowy shape,
<dt>Might not compare with his pure ivory white,
<dt>On whose fair front a poet's pen might write,
<dt>Whose rosiate red excels the crimson grape.
<dt>His love-enticing delicate soft limbs,
<dt>Are rarely framed t' intrap poor gazing eyes;
<dt>His cheeks, the lily and carnation dyes,
<dt>With lovely tincture which Apollo's dims.
<dt>His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet,
<dt>His mouth a hive, his tongue a honeycomb,
<dt>Where muses (like bees) make their mansion.
<dt>His teeth pure pearl in blushing coral set.
<dt>Oh how can such a body sin-procuring,
<dt>Be slow to love, and quick to hate, enduring?
