<a name="012"></a><h2>"When I do count the clock that tells the time"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I do count the clock that tells the time,
<dt>And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
<dt>When I behold the violet past prime,
<dt>And sable curls, all silver'd o'er with white;
<dt>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
<dt>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
<dt>And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
<dt>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard;
<dt>Then of thy beauty do I question make,
<dt>That thou among the wastes of time must go,
<dt>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
<dt>And die as fast as they see others grow;
<dt>And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
<dt>Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence. 
<p></p>
<a name="018"></a><h2>"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>         
</p>
<dt>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
<dt>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
<dt>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
<dt>And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
<dt>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
<dt>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
<dt>And every fair from fair sometime declines,
<dt>By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;
<dt>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
<dt>Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
<dt>Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
<dt>When in eternal lines to time thou growest;
<dt>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
<dt>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. 
<p></p>
 
<a name="029"></a><h2>"When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>         
</p>
<dt>When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
<dt>I all alone beweep my outcast state,
<dt>And trouble deaf Heaven with my bootless cries,
<dt>And look upon myself, and curse my fate,
<dt>Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
<dt>Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,
<dt>Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
<dt>With what I most enjoy contented least:
<dt>Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
<dt>Haply I think on thee,--and then my state
<dt>(Like to the lark at break of day arising
<dt>From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate;
<dt>For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
<dt>That then I scorn to change my state with kings'. 
<p></p>
<a name="030"></a><h2>"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>      
</p>
<dt>When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
<dt>I summon up remembrance of things past,
<dt>I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
<dt>And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
<dt>Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,
<dt>For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
<dt>And weep afresh love's long-since cancell'd woe,
<dt>And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight.
<dt>Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
<dt>And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
<dt>The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
<dt>Which I new pay as if not paid before.
<dt>But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
<dt>All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end. 
<p></p>
<a name="055"></a><h2>"Not marble nor the gilded monuments"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>        
</p>
<dt>Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
<dt>Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
<dt>But you shall shine more bright in these contents
<dt>Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.
<dt>When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
<dt>And broils root out the work of masonry,
<dt>Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
<dt>The living record of your memory.
<dt>'Gainst death and all oblivious enmity
<dt>Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room,
<dt>Even in the eyes of all posterity
<dt>That wear this world out to the ending doom.
<dt>So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
<dt>You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes. 
<p></p>
<a name="073"></a><h2>"That time of year thou mayst in me behold"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>         
</p>
<dt>That time of year thou mayst in me behold
<dt>When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
<dt>Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
<dt>Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
<dt>In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
<dt>As after sunset fadeth from the west;
<dt>Which by and by black night doth take away,
<dt>Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
<dt>In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,
<dt>That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
<dt>As the deathbed whereon it must expire,
<dt>Consumed by that which it was nourished by.
<dt>This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,
<dt>To love that well which thou must leave ere long. 
<p></p>
<a name="087"></a><h2>"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
<dt>And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:
<dt>The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
<dt>My bonds in thee are all determinate.
<dt>For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
<dt>And for that riches where is my deserving?
<dt>The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
<dt>And so my patent back again is swerving.
<dt>Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,
<dt>Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;
<dt>So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
<dt>Comes home again, on better judgment making.
<dt>Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
<dt>In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
<p>
<a name="094"></a><h2>"They that have power to hurt and will do none"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>       
</p>
<dt>They that have power to hurt and will do none,
<dt>That do not do the thing they most do show,
<dt>Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
<dt>Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;
<dt>They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
<dt>And husband nature's riches from expense;
<dt>They are the lords and owners of their faces,
<dt>Others but stewards of their excellence.
<dt>The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
<dt>Though to itself it only live and die,
<dt>But if that flower with base infection meet,
<dt>The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
<dt>For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
<dt>Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds. 
<p></p>
<p>
<a name="099"></a><h2>"The forward violet thus did I chide"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>The forward violet thus did I chide:
<dt>Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
<dt>If not from my love's breath?  The purple pride
<dt>Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
<dt>In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
<dt>The lily I condemnèd for thy hand,
<dt>And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;
<dt>The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
<dt>One blushing shame, another white despair;
<dt>A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,
<dt>And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
<dt>But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
<dt>A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
<dt>More flowers I noted, yet I none could see
<dt>But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.

<p>
<dt>Let me not to the marriage of true minds
<dt>Admit impediments. Love is not love
<dt>Which alters when it alteration finds,
<dt>Or bends with the remover to remove:
<dt>O no; it is an ever-fixed mark,
<dt>That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;
<dt>It is the star to every wandering bark,
<dt>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
<dt>Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
<dt>Within his bending sickle's compass come;
<dt>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
<dt>But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
<dt>If this be error, and upon me prov'd,
<dt>I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.</dt>

<p>         
</p>
<dt>Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame
<dt>Is lust in action; and till action, lust
<dt>Is perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
<dt>Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;
<dt>Enjoy'd no sooner, but despised straight;
<dt>Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,
<dt>Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,
<dt>On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
<dt>Mad in pursuit, and in possession so;
<dt>Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
<dt>A bliss in proof,--and prov'd, a very woe;
<dt>Before, a joy propos'd; behind, a dream:
<dt>All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
<dt>To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

<a name="130"></a><h2>"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>      
</p>
<dt>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
<dt>Coral is far more red than her lips' red:
<dt>If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
<dt>If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
<dt>I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
<dt>But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
<dt>And in some perfumes is there more delight
<dt>Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
<dt>I love to hear her speak,--yet well I know
<dt>That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
<dt>I grant I never saw a goddess go,
<dt>My mistress when she walks, treads on the ground;
<dt>And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
<dt>As any she belied with false compare. 
<p></p>
<p>
<a name="144"></a><h2>"Two loves I have of comfort and despair"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>        
</p>
<dt>Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
<dt>Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
<dt>The better angel is a man right fair,
<dt>The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
<dt>To win me soon to hell, my female evil
<dt>Tempteth my better angel from my side,
<dt>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
<dt>Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
<dt>And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
<dt>Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;
<dt>But being both from me, both to each friend,
<dt>I guess one angel in another's hell:
<dt>Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
<dt>Till my bad angel fire my good one out. 
<p></p>
<a name="145"></a><h2>"Those lips that love's own hand did make"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>      
</p>
<dt>Those lips that love's own hand did make
<dt>Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate,"
<dt>To me that languished for her sake.
<dt>But when she saw my woeful state,
<dt>Straight in her heart did mercy come,
<dt>Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
<dt>Was used in giving gentle doom,
<dt>And taught it thus anew to greet.
<dt>"I hate" she altered with an end
<dt>That followed it as gentle day
<dt>Doth follow night, who, like a fiend,
<dt>From heaven to hell is flown away.
<dt>"I hate" from hate away she threw.
<dt>And saved my life, saying "not you."
