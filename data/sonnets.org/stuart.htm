<a name=010></a><h2>The Heart</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Deliver me from mine own dreams! but save
<dt>From mine own thoughts; for these, too busy still,
<dt>Fill up the mightiest measure of mine ill
<dt>And form the darkest doom that I must brave!
<dt>Deliverance, then, from these I deeply crave;
<dt>But patience this must need, and power and skill;
<dt>For the great heart is cunning, and its will
<dt>Right tyrannous! say who stoops not as its slave?
<p>
<dt>The heart is as a giant in its might,
<dt>And doth in mastery of its greatness tower,
<dt>And riseth in its strength, to blast and blight!
<dt>Heart, thou art a host of giants in thine hour!
<dt>The passions are thy warriors; and these fight
<dt>As though their arms were storms, the thunder's conquering dower!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Listen Awhile</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Listen awhile! but lend me thy loved ear,
<dt>And I will teach my soul of souls to thine!
<dt>The coils of thought will curiously untwine,
<dt>And strive to show how deeply thou art dear.
<dt>But first must I full many a mist of fear
<dt>And cloud of grief, that dull this doom of mine,
<dt>Essay to chase away ere yet can shine
<dt>The star of perfect love, full, strong, and clear!
<p>
<dt>Then, then behold it all one blaze of light,
<dt>Itself a glowing firmament of fire,
<dt>All unextinguishably clear and bright,
<dt>Though oft thus girt by clouds deep, dark, and dire
<dt>That do disturb its splendour; check its might.
<dt>Listen! and smile, and bid these heavy glooms retire.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Past and Future</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I cannot rule my thoughts that round one theme
<dt>Hang, like to swarming bees, till all grow one!
<dt>And yet that theme I fain would learn to shun.
<dt>It is my life's too fair but fatal dream.
<dt>Too dangerous do its deep enchantments seem,
<dt>But dearer than my soul--undone! undone!
<dt>I cannot rule my thoughts; each rising sun
<dt>Sees me still drifting farther down the stream.
<p>
<dt>O fearful stream of passion! wave by wave
<dt>Dost thou engulf my being; must it be?
<dt>Is there no power to strengthen or to save?
<dt>No tokens of a change these eyes can see:
<dt>Days past and days to come one likeness have.
<dt>I know my future so, it seems a memory!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>The Music</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There is a music in my mind tonight
<dt>A visitation of sweet thoughts, and rare!
<dt>I know not whence, but feel them springing there,
<dt>A&euml;ry and delicate, as wind or light.
<dt>That music in my mind of magic might,
<dt>This light cast down, on every thought, so fair,
<dt>This stirring sweetness, like to moving air,
<dt>Can this be love?--the immortal and the bright!
<p>
<dt>It is surely love! for nought beside can be
<dt>So strange and yet so sweet, so soft yet strong.
<dt>It is love, the crown of all, crowned mystery!
<dt>My thoughts are gathering to a starry throng,
<dt>And scattering forth their brightness far and free;
<dt>Yet love, that sun, shines dazzling these among!
