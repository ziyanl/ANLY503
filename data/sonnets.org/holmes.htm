<p>
<dt>The Shannon bore me to thy bosom wide:
<dt>I wandered with it on its winding way
<dt>By fields of yellow corn and new mown hay,
<dt>And far blue hills that rose on either side,
<dt>And low dark woods that fringed the ebbing tide;
<dt>And ever as its waters neared the west,
<dt>Out of the slumber of its broadening breast
<dt>Faint momentary ripples rose and died
<dt>And rose again before the breeze and grew
<dt>To wavelets dancing in the noonday light,
<dt>And these were changed to waves of ocean blue,
<dt>And creek and headland faded from the sight,
<dt>And oh! at last--at last I floated free
<dt>On the long rollers of the open sea.
</p>
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>Eternal Vigil</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Oh! once again upon thy heaving breast
<dt>I floated, like a seabird when it braves
<dt>The shoreward onset of thy flowing waves
<dt>And leaps triumphant on each rushing crest:
<dt>Round me in dark magnificent unrest,
<dt>The billows of the wild Atlantic rolled
<dt>Far, far away, into the gates of gold,
<dt>The sunlit portals of the stormy west:
<dt>O never wearied! In the hush of noon
<dt>Thy billows break the paths of golden sleep:
<dt>They break the dreamlike lustre of the moon
<dt>Earth knows the hours of darkness: thou dost keep
<dt>Eternal vigil: still thy surges white
<dt>Flash through the deepest gloom of starless night.
