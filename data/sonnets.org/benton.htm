<h2><a name="dahkota"></a>Dahkota</h2>
<p>
<dt>Sea-like in billowy distance, far away
<dt>The half-broke prairies stretch on every hand;
<dt>How wide the circuit of their summer day--
<dt>What measureless acres of primeval land,
<dt>Treeless and birdless, by no eyesight spanned!
<dt>Looking along the horizon's endless line
<dt>Man seems a pigmy in these realms of space;
<dt>No segment of our planet--so divine--
<dt>Turns up such beauty to the moon's fair face!
<dt>Here are soft grasses, flowers of tender hue,
<dt>Palimpsests of the old and coming race,
<dt>Vistas most wonderful, and vast and new;
<dt>And see--above--where giant lightnings play,
<dt>From what an arch the sun pours forth the day!

<h2><a name="chappaqua"></a>At Chappaqua</h2>    
<dt>         
His cherished woods are mute.&nbsp; The stream glides 
down    
<dt>         
The hill as when I knew it years ago;    
<dt>         
The dark, pine arbor with its priestly gown    
<dt>         
Stands hushed, as if our grief it still would show;    
<dt>         
The silver springs are cupless, and the flow    
<dt>         
Of friendly feet no more bereaves the grass,    
<dt>         
For he is absent who was wont to pass    
<dt>         
Along this wooded path.&nbsp; His axe's blow    
<dt>    
<dt>         
No more disturbs the impertinent bole or bough;    
<dt>         
Nor moves his pen our heedless nation now,    
<dt>         
Which, sworn to justice, stirred the people so.    
<dt>         
In some far world his much-loved face must glow    
<dt>         
With rapture still.&nbsp; This breeze once fanned his 
brow.    
<dt>         
This is the peaceful Mecca all men know!&nbsp;    
<dt>
