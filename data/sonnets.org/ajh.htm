<p>
<dt>The wise Ulysses, honored once of Kings,
<dt>When he, a beggar, sat at his own gate,
<dt>Had still three friends, who loved him as when great--
<dt>And each to man like his own shadow clings.
<dt>No change in them from change of fortune springs,
<dt>Wealth, poverty, lofty or low estate,
<dt>Fame, infamy, by his own faults or fate,
<dt>These all they look on as indifferent things.
<dt>Ill-treatment sours not them--harsh words are breath,
<dt>Or still they love, even if they moan and mope,
<dt>And will be parted from him but by death;
<dt>Cheerfully <i>he</i> may with misfortune cope,
<dt>And find some flowers even in life's dreariest path,
<dt>Who still has left his Wife--his Dog--and Hope!
<p><i>Columbia, S. Carolina.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. J. H.
