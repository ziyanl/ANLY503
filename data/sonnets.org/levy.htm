<a name=010></a><h2>London Poets (In Memoriam)</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>They trod the streets and squares where now I tread,
<dt>With weary hearts, a little while ago;
<dt>When, thin and grey, the melancholy snow
<dt>Clung to the leafless branches overhead;
<dt>Or when the smoke-veiled sky grew stormy-red
<dt>In autumn; with a re-arisen woe
<dt>Wrestled, what time the passionate spring winds blow;
<dt>And paced scorched stones in summer:--they are dead.
<dt>The sorrow of their souls to them did seem
<dt>As real as mine to me, as permanent.
<dt>To-day, it is the shadow of a dream,
<dt>The half-forgotten breath of breezes spent.
<dt>So shall another soothe his woe supreme--
<dt>"No more he comes, who this way came and went."
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Two Terrors</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Two terrors fright my soul by night and day:
<dt>The first is Life, and with her come the years ;
<dt>A weary, winding train of maidens they,
<dt>With forward-fronting eyes, too sad for tears;
<dt>Upon whose kindred faces, blank and grey,
<dt>The shadow of a kindred woe appears.
<dt>Death is the second terror; who shall say
<dt>What form beneath the shrouding mantle nears?
<dt>Which way she turn, my soul finds no relief,
<dt>My smitten soul may not be comforted ;
<dt>Alternately she swings from grief to grief,
<dt>And, poised between them, sways from dread to dread.
<dt>For there she dreads because she knows ; and here,
<dt>Because she knows not, only faints with fear.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Lohengrin</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Back to the mystic shore beyond the main
<dt>The mystic craft has sped, and left no trace.
<dt>Ah, nevermore may she behold his face,
<dt>Nor touch his hand, nor hear his voice again!
<dt>With hidden front she crouches; all in vain
<dt>The proffered balm. A vessel nears the place ;
<dt>They bring her young, lost brother; see her strain
<dt>The new-found nurseling in a close embrace.
<dt>God, we have lost Thee with much questioning.
<dt>In vain we seek Thy trace by sea and land,
<dt>And in Thine empty fanes where no men sing.
<dt>What shall we do through all the weary days ?
<dt>Thus wail we and lament. Our eyes we raise,
<dt>And, lo, our Brother with an outstretched hand!
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>On the Wye in May</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Now is the perfect moment of the year.
<dt>Half naked branches, half a mist of green,
<dt>Vivid and delicate the slopes appear ;
<dt>The cool, soft air is neither fierce nor keen,
<dt>And in the temperate sun we feel no fear ;
<dt>Of all the hours which shall be and have been,
<dt>It is the briefest as it is most dear,
<dt>It is the dearest as the shortest seen.
<dt>O it was best, belov&eacute;d, at the first.--
<dt>Our hands met gently, and our meeting sight
<dt>Was steady; on our senses scarce had burst
<dt>The faint, fresh fragrance of the new delight. . . .
<dt>I seek that clime, unknown, without a name,
<dt>Where first and best and last shall be the same.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Most wonderful and strange it seems, that I
<dt>Who but a little time ago was tost
<dt>High on the waves of passion and of pain,
<dt>With aching heart and wildly throbbing brain,
<dt>Who peered into the darkness, deeming vain
<dt>All things there found if but One thing were lost,
<dt>Thus calm and still and silent here should lie,
<dt>Watching and waiting,--waiting passively.
<dt>The dark has faded, and before mine eyes
<dt>Have long, grey flats expanded, dim and bare ;
<dt>And through the changing guises all things wear
<dt>Inevitable Law I recognise :
<dt>Yet in my heart a hint of feeling lies
<dt>Which half a hope and half is a despair.
