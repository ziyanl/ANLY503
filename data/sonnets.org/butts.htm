<h2>    Homesickness</h2>
<p>
<dt>We oft are sorrowful yet have no word
<dt>To tell why gloom has settled on the day
<dt>Like clouds that blot the azure field with gray;
<dt>We know not why the singing of a bird
<dt>Touches the soul to pain as if we heard
<dt>Within the voice another music say
<dt>Things not translated in our human way;
<dt>We pierce ourselves with blame yet have not erred.
<dt>
<dt>Exiles we are, and when the outreaching heart
<dt> Is quickened to sense its native atmosphere,—
<dt>When through the fair world's form the spirit part
<dt>  Reveals itself an instant passing dear,—
<dt>When in a flower's sweet face new meanings dart
<dt>We mourn, shut out, for that which is so near.
