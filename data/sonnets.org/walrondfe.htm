<dt>A tremor shook the inmost heart of night,
<dt>And starting up one cried: "The day has come!"
<dt>But others cursed him, bidding him be dumb--
<dt>"The Sun is dead: there will be no more light."
<dt>Again the darkness trembled, and again;
<dt>And now there crept into the eastern sky
<dt>A hesitant greyness, and a voiceless sigh
<dt>Passed wakefully across the sleeping plain.
<dt>Then slowly, very slowly, one by one,
<dt>Leaves stirred and branches quivered, till at last
<dt>Expectant, while the pulse of dawn beat fast,
<dt>All nature waited, breathless, for the Sun.
<dt>The Sun-god drew his bow: ray after ray
<dt>His arrows swept the heavens, and lo! 'twas day!

<p>
<dt>Peace, rest, content! Ah, God! to tired hearts,
<dt>To feet that falter at the long road's end,
<dt>To weary players that have played their parts
<dt>In the great drama, these in fulness send.
<dt>But unto us, whose veins are quick with fire,
<dt>Whose wants are wide as earth and high as heaven,
<dt>Who spend our souls in some supreme desire,
<dt>Be no content, but large impatience given.
<p>
<dt>Oh! while the arm has strength to weight a blow
<dt>Let there be fighting, Lord, and deeds to dare,
<dt>Such deeds as ask the bravest and the best.
<dt>Mass thick the foes against us, make us know
<dt>The sting of pain, the threatening of despair,
<dt>And so compell us to our loftiest.

<p>
<dt>Let those sore wounded with the spears of life
<dt>Crave for oblivion; those who gasp for breath
<dt>In the hot whirl of this perplexing strife
<dt>Pray God to cease from striving after death!
<dt>To each his heaven: but what have we to do
<dt>With rest from labour, we whose dearest thought
<dt>Is still to match our model with the true,
<dt>Whose joy in life is in achievement wrought?
<p>
<dt>God, if Thy pity lean towards man's hope,
<dt>And Thou wouldst see Thy creatures each content,
<dt>Give us no resting, but a larger scope
<dt>To strive and battle with impediment.
<dt>Give strength to fill our loftiest desire,
<dt>That we may triumph where we now aspire.

<dt>Thou child of faith--whose little store of days
<dt>Was beautiful with prayer, whom Reverence
<dt>Made humble, and white-handed Innocence
<dt>Led purely thro' the dust of earthly ways--
<dt>God spared thy soul the terror and amaze
<dt>Of that fierce wrestling with Omnipotence,
<dt>Which Jacob knew at Peniel, the suspense
<dt>Of aching doubt, and error's long delays.
<p>
<dt>Thy spirit questioned not, but saw fulfilled
<dt>The uttermost of love when Calvary
<dt>Beheld the consummation of all years.
<dt>Ah, childlike trust! so fair to us who build
<dt>The altar of our faith by dark degree,
<dt>And join the stones together with our tears.
