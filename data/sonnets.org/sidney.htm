  "Loving in truth..."
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,
<dt>
That the dear she might take some pleasure of my pain,
<dt>
Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,
<dt>
Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,
<dt>
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe:
<dt>
Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,
<dt>
Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow
<dt>
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.
<dt>
But words came halting forth, wanting Invention's stay;
<dt>
Invention, Nature's child, fled stepdame Study's blows;
<dt>
And others' feet still seemed but strangers in my way.
<dt>
Thus, great with child to speak, and helpless in my throes,
<dt>
Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite:
<dt>
"Fool," said my Muse to me, "look in thy heart, and write."
<P>

<H2>
  "Not at the first sight..."
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Not at the first sight, nor with a dribbed shot,
<dt>
Love gave the wound, which, while I breathe, will bleed;
<dt>
But known worth did in mine of time proceed,
<dt>
Till by degrees it had full conquest got.
<dt>
I saw and liked; I liked but loved not;
<dt>
I loved, but straight did not what love decreed;
<dt>
At length to love's decrees I, forced, agreed,
<dt>
Yet with repining at so partial lot.
<dt>
Now even that footstep of lost liberty
<dt>
Is gone, and now, like slave-born Muscovite,
<dt>
I call it praise to suffer tyranny;
<dt>
And now employ the remnant of my wit
<dt>
To make me self believe that all is well,
<dt>
While, with a feeling skill, I paint my hell.

  "Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine,
<dt>
That, bravely masked, their fancies may be told;
<dt>
Or Pindar's apes flaunt they in phrases fine,
<dt>
Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold;
<dt>
Or else let them in statelier glory shine,
<dt>
Ennobling new-found tropes with problems old;
<dt>
Or with strange similes enrich each line,
<dt>
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric hold.
<dt>
For me, in sooth, no Muse but one I know;
<dt>
Phrases and problems from my reach do grow,
<dt>
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites.
<dt>
How then? even thus,--in Stella's face I read
<dt>
What love and beauty be, then all my deed
<dt>
But copying is, what in her Nature writes.

<H2>
  "It is most true..."
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
It is most true that eyes are formed to serve
<dt>
The inward light, and that the heavenly part
<dt>
Ought to be king, from whose rules who do swerve,
<dt>
Rebels to nature, strive for their own smart.
<dt>
It is most true what we call Cupid's dart
<dt>
An image is which for ourselves we carve,
<dt>
And, fools, adore in temple of our heart
<dt>
Till that good god make church and churchman starve.
<dt>
True, that true beauty virtue is indeed,
<dt>
Whereof this beauty can be but a shade,
<dt>
Which elements with mortal mixture breed.
<dt>
True, that on earth we are but pilgrims made,
<dt>
And should in soul up to our country move;
<dt>
True, and yet true that I must Stella love.

  "Some lovers speak, when they their muses entertain"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Some lovers speak, when they their muses entertain
<dt>
Of hopes begot by fear, of wot not what desires,
<dt>
Of force of heav'nly beams infusing hellish pain,
<dt>
Of living deaths, dear wounds, fair storms, and freezing fires;
<dt>
Someone his song in Jove and Jove's strange tales attires,
<dt>
Bordered with bulls and swans, powdered with golden rain;
<dt>
Another humbler wit to shepherd's pipe retires,
<dt>
Yet hiding royal blood full oft in rural vein;
<dt>
To some a sweetest plaint a sweetest style affords,
<dt>
While tears pour out his ink, and sighs breathe out his words,
<dt>
His paper pale despair, and pain his pen doth move.
<dt>
I can speak what I feel, and feel as much as they,
<dt>
But think that all the map of my state I display
<dt>
When trembling voice brings forth that I do Stella love.

<P>
<dt>
Alas, have I not pain enough; my friend,
<dt>
Upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire
<dt>
Than did on him who first stole down the fire,
<dt>
While Love on me doth all his quiver spend,
<dt>
But with your rhubarb words ye must contend,
<dt>
To grieve me worse, in saying that desire
<dt>
Doth plunge my well-formed soul even in the mire
<dt>
Of sinful thoughts which do in ruin end?
<dt>
If that be sin which doth the manners frame,
<dt>
Well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed,
<dt>
Ready of wit and fearing nought but shame;
<dt>
If that be sin which in fixed hearts doth breed
<dt>
A loathing of all loose unchastity,
<dt>
Then love is sin, and let me sinful be.

  "You that do search for every purling spring"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
You that do search for every purling spring
<dt>
Which from the ribs of old Parnassus flows,
<dt>
And every flower, not sweet perhaps, which grows
<dt>
Near thereabouts into your poesy wring;
<dt>
You that do dictionary's method bring
<dt>
Into your rhymes, running in rattling rows;
<dt>
You that poor Petrarch's long-deceased woes
<dt>
With new-born sighs and denizened wit do sing;
<dt>
You take wrong ways, those far-fet helps be such
<dt>
As do bewray a want of inward touch,
<dt>
And sure at length stol'n goods do come to light.
<dt>
But if, both for your love and skill, your name
<dt>
You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame,
<dt>
Stella behold, and then begin to endite.

Who, like a thief, hid in dark bush doth lie
<dt>
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey.
<dt>
So tyrant he no fitter place could spy,
<dt>
Nor so fair level in so secret stay,
<dt>
As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly eye;
<dt>
There himself with his shot he close doth lay.
<dt>
Poor passenger, pass now thereby I did,
<dt>
And stayed, pleased with the prospect of the place,
<dt>
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid;
<dt>
But straight I saw motions of lightning grace,
<dt>
And then descried the glist'ring of his dart;
<dt>
But ere I could fly thence, it pierced my heart.

Your words, my friend, (right healthful caustics) blame
<dt>
My young mind marred, whom love doth windlass so
<dt>
That mine own writings, like bad servants, show
<dt>
My wits quick in vain thoughts, in virtue lame;
<dt>
That Plato I read for nought but if he tame
<dt>
Such coltish years; that to my birth I owe
<dt>
Nobler desires, lest else that friendly foe,
<dt>
Great expectation, wear a train of shame.
<dt>
For since mad March great promise made of me,
<dt>
If now the May of my years much decline,
<dt>
What can be hoped my harvest time will be?
<dt>
Sure, you say well, Your wisdom's golden mine
<dt>
Dig deep with learning's spade. Now tell me this,

Hath this world aught so fair as Stella is?

Rich fools there be whose base and filthy heart
<dt>
Lies hatching still the goods wherein they flow,

And damning their own selves to Tantal's smart,
<dt>
Wealth breeding want, more blest, more wretched grow.
<dt>
Yet to those fools heaven such wit doth impart,
<dt>
As what their hands do hold, their heads do know;
<dt>
And knowing, love; and loving, lay apart
<dt>
As sacred things, far from all danger's show.
<dt>
But that rich fool, who by blind fortune's lot
<dt>
The richest gem of love and life enjoys,
<dt>
And can with foul abuse such beauties blot,
<dt>
Let him, deprived of sweet but unfelt joys,
<dt>
Exiled for aye from those high treasures which
<dt>
He knows not, grow in only folly rich!

With me those pains, for God's sake, do not take;

I list not dig so deep for brazen fame.
<dt>
When I say Stella, I do mean the same
<dt>
Princess of beauty for whose only sake
<dt>
The reins of love I love, though never slake,
<dt>
And joy therein, though nations count it shame.
<dt>
I beg no subject to use eloquence,
<dt>
Nor in hid ways do guide philosophy;
<dt>
Look at my hands for no such quintessence,
<dt>
But know that I in pure simplicity
<dt>
Breathe out the flames which burn within my heart,

Love only reading unto me this art.

Whether the Turkish new-moon minded be

How Poles' right king means without leave of host

To warm with ill-made fire cold Muscovy;

If French can yet three parts in one agree;

What now the Dutch in their full diets boast;

How Holland hearts, now so good towns be lost,

Trust in the shade of pleasing Orange-tree;

How Ulster likes of that same golden bit

Wherewith my father once made it half tame;

If in the Scotch Court be no welt'ring yet:

That busy archer his sharp arrows tries?

Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes
<dt>
Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case:
<dt>
I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace
<dt>
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.
<dt>
Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,
<dt>
Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit?
<dt>
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?
<dt>
Do they above love to be loved, and yet
<dt>
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?

Do they call "virtue" there--ungratefulness?

Heart, rent thyself, thou dost thyself but right;

No lovely Paris made thy Helen his,

No force, no fraud, robbed thee of thy delight,

A burthened heart. How can words ease, which are

The glasses of thy daily vexing care?
<dt>
Oft cruel fights well pictured forth do please.
<dt>
Art not ashamed to publish thy disease?
<dt>
Nay, that may breed my fame, it is so rare.
<dt>
But will not wise men think thy words fond ware?
<dt>
Then be they close, and so none shall displease.
<dt>
What idler thing than speak and not be heard?
<dt>
What harder thing than smart and not to speak?
<dt>
Peace, foolish wit! with wit my wit is marred.
<dt>
Thus write I, while I doubt to write, and wreak

My harms on ink's poor loss. Perhaps some find

Stella's great powers, that so confuse my mind.

And if these things, as being thine by right,
<dt>
Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,
<dt>
Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see.

O Stella dear, how much thy power hath wrought,
<dt>
That hast my mind, none of the basest, brought
<dt>
My still-kept course, while other sleep, to moan;
<dt>
Alas, if from the height of virtue's throne
<dt>
Thou canst vouchsafe the influence of a thought
<dt>
Upon a wretch that long thy grace hath sought,
<dt>
Weigh then how I by thee am overthrown;
<dt>
And then think thus--although thy beauty be
<dt>
Made manifest by such a victory,
<dt>
Yet noblest conquerors do wrecks avoid.
<dt>
Since then thou hast so far subdued me,
<dt>
That in my heart I offer still to thee,
<dt>
Oh, do not let thy temple be destroyed.

Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance
<dt>
Guided so well that I obtained the prize,
<dt>
Both by the judgment of the English eyes
<dt>
And of some sent from that sweet enemy, France;
<dt>
Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance,
<dt>
Town-folks my strength; a daintier judge applies
<dt>
His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise;
<dt>
Some lucky wits impute it but to chance;
<dt>
Others, because of both sides I do take
<dt>
My blood from them who did excel in this,
<dt>
Think nature me a man of arms did make.
<dt>
How far they shot awry! The true cause is,
<dt>
Stella looked on, and from her heav'nly face
<dt>
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race.

<dt>
Stella oft sees the very face of woe
<dt>
Painted in my beclouded stormy face,
<dt>
But cannot skill to pity my disgrace,
<dt>
Not though thereof the cause herself she know;
<dt>
Yet hearing late a fable, which did show
<dt>
Of lovers never known a grievous case,
<dt>
Pity thereof gat in her breast such place
<dt>
That, from the sea derived, tears' spring did flow.
<dt>
Alas, if fancy, drawn by imaged things
<dt>
Though false, yet with free scope, more grace doth breed
<dt>
Than servant's wrack, where new doubts honor brings;
<dt>
Then think, my dear, that you in me do read
<dt>
Of lovers' ruin some sad tragedy.
<dt>
I am not I; pity the tale of me.

Because I breathe not love to everyone,

Nor do not use set colors for to wear,

Nor nourish special locks of vowed hair,
<dt>
Nor give each speech a full point of a groan,
<dt>
The courtly nymphs, acquainted with the moan
<dt>
Of them who in their lips Love's standard bear,
<dt>
What, he! say they of me, Now I dare swear
<dt>
He cannot love; no, no, let him alone.
<dt>
And think so still, so Stella know my mind;
<dt>
Profess indeed I do not Cupid's art;
<dt>
But you, fair maids, at length this true shall find,
<dt>
That his right badge is but worn in the heart;
<dt>
Dumb swans, not chatt'ring pies, do lovers prove;
<dt>
They love indeed who quake to say they love.

Muses, I oft invoked your holy aid,

With choicest flowers my speech t' engarland so
<dt>
That it, despised in true but naked show,
<dt>
Might win some grace in your sweet grace arrayed;
<dt>
And oft whole troops of saddest words I stayed,
<dt>
Striving abroad a-foraging to go,
<dt>
Until by your inspiring I might know
<dt>
How their black banner might be best displayed.
<dt>
But now I mean no more your help to try,
<dt>
Nor other sug'ring of my speech to prove,
<dt>
But on her name incessantly to cry;
<dt>
For let me but name her whom I do love,
<dt>
So sweet sounds straight mine ear and heart do hit,
<dt>
That I well find no eloquence like it.

O grammar-rules, O now your virtues show;

So children still read you with awful eyes,

As my young dove may, in your precepts wise,
<dt>
Her grant to me by her own virtue know;
<dt>
For late, with heart most high, with eyes most low,
<dt>
I craved the thing which ever she denies;
<dt>
She, lightning Love displaying Venus' skies,
<dt>
Lest once should not be heard, twice said, No, No!
<dt>
Sing then, my muse, now Io Paean sing;
<dt>
Heav'ns envy not at my high triumphing,
<dt>
But grammar's force with sweet success confirm;
<dt>
For grammar says,--oh this, dear Stella, weigh,
<dt>
For grammar says,--to grammar who says nay?
<dt>
That in one speech two negatives affirm!

Who will in fairest book of Nature know

How virtue may best lodg'd in beauty be,

Let him but learn of Love to read in thee,

Stella, those fair lines which true goodness show.
<dt>
There shall he find all vices' overthrow,
<dt>
Not by rude force, but sweetest sovranty
<dt>
Of reason, from whose light those night-birds fly,
<dt>
That inward sun in thine eyes shineth so.
<dt>
And, not content to be Perfection's heir
<dt>
Thyself, dost strive all minds that way to move
<dt>
Who mark in thee what is in thee most fair.
<dt>
So while thy beauty draws the heart to love,
<dt>
As fast that virtue bends that love to good.

But ah, Desire still cries: "Give me some food!"

My true-love hath my heart and I have his,

By just exchange one for the other given:

I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;

There never was a bargain better driven.
<dt>
His heart in me keeps me and him in one;
<dt>
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:
<dt>
He loves my heart, for once it was his own;
<dt>
I cherish his because in me it bides.
<dt>
His heart his wound received from my sight;
<dt>
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;
<dt>
For as from me on him his hurt did light,
<dt>
So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:
<dt>
Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,
<dt>
My true love hath my heart and I have his.

Thou blind man's mark, thou fool's self-chosen snare,

Fond fancy's scum, and dregs of scattered thought;

Band of all evils, cradle of causeless care;
<dt>
Thou web of will, whose end is never wrought:
<dt>
Desire, Desire! I have too dearly bought,
<dt>
With price of mangled mind, thy worthless ware;
<dt>
Too long, too long, asleep thou hast me brought,
<dt>
Who shouldst my mind to higher things prepare,
<dt>
But yet in vain thou hast my ruin sought,
<dt>
In vain thou mad'st me to vain things aspire,
<dt>
In vain thou kindlest all thy smoky fire,
<dt>
For Virtue hath this better lesson taught:
<dt>
Within myself to seek my only hire,
<dt>
Desiring nought but how to kill Desire.

Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust;

And thou, my mind, aspire to higher things;

Grow rich in that which never taketh rust;

Whatever fades, but fading pleasure brings.
<dt>
Draw in thy beams, and humble all thy might
<dt>
To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be,
<dt>
Which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light,
<dt>
That doth both shine and give us light to see.
<dt>
O take fast hold; let that light be thy guide
<dt>
In this small course which birth draws out to death,
<dt>
And think how evil becometh him to slide
<dt>
Who seeketh heaven, and comes of heavenly breath.
<dt>
Then farewell, world; thy uttermost I see:
<dt>
Eternal Love, maintain thy life in me.
