<a name=010></a><h2>Love's Saint</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Some lip will use her name--a rapt surprise,
<dt>Passing the heart's set ward, upon me steals.
<dt>One word, to me, doth one saint canonize;
<dt>And all the acquest of earth and heaven it seals.
<dt>I name that name, and doubt for me has ending,
<dt>And Sorrow, strong of old, forgets her part;
<dt>The battle-cry it is, to God ascending,
<dt>For all the triumphs of my labouring heart.
<dt>Ah, what is beauty's charge, what true, what dearest,
<dt>But that one lovely word will speak it home?
<dt>To splendour, to humility, 'tis nearest;
<dt>And the last depths of longing it can plumb.
<dt>The plaudit of all joy, all good it bears;
<dt>I breathe it, and a breath completes my prayers.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Flesh and Spirit</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>No! 'twas the questing dream that first achieved her--
<dt>More sensed for knowing no material part,
<dt>More real that no false outward eye perceived her,
<dt>Too gross, but that pure eye within my heart.
<dt>Nor feigned I, as my spirit so embraced her,
<dt>These arms encumbered might; ah! could they too,
<dt>Would she not fade as vision e'er effaced her,
<dt>As loves in this weak flesh so often do?
<dt>In flesh she might escape me, might expire
<dt>In the vicissitudes through flesh that range;
<dt>But, being the shadow of my heart's desire,
<dt>She could not pass beyond me, could not change.
<dt>O paradox! Want food--you are richer fed!
<dt>Lack the coarse crumbs--you find diviner bread!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>After the Storm</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The storm is done--the lightning with its lust
<dt>To rend the unhallowed dome in ruin dire;
<dt>The purple heaps, from the rank chaos thrust
<dt>On sheets of fell and inauspicious fire;
<dt>The thunder bellowing loud on every bound;
<dt>The hissing bolt, so tossed as to complete
<dt>All permutations of Satanic sound;
<dt>The flood that opened heaven and ransomed it.
<dt>Benign now is that beatific blue.
<dt>The flame that fires the hill is now remote
<dt>From aught in evil. Clemency anew
<dt>--Crowns every leaf, and sings in every throat.
<dt>Shall, then, the rage of earth and heaven depart,
<dt>And not the rancour of the unsensing heart?
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>To Winter in the Midst of His Reign</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou grim physician, armed with septic shears,
<dt>Thou that dissemblest even in death's repose
<dt>Earth's quiet pulse and her remedial throes,
<dt>How dull thy visage on this day appears!
<dt>Let now the dismal heaven give vent, its tears
<dt>Come frozen ever; no gale coeval blows
<dt>Filled with the ravaged perfume of the rose;
<dt>And keep not all fair things forsaken biers?
<dt>O haste, then, spiritless minister, thy pains
<dt>To charge the sources of the unfruitful earth
<dt>For harvests blest in wood, in plot and lawn!
<dt>O laggard, on! till fire re-flood the veins
<dt>Of Spring here, ay, to trip the vales with Mirth,
<dt>As, long night over, does the exulting dawn!
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>True Being</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Rich hour! is not thy gift a radiant thing?
<dt>The truth here blazoned in this marble and gold,
<dt>Here writ in this refulgence manifold,
<dt>Hath sunned my groped redemption: lo, I fling--
<dt>How lightly!--off ungraced desire; I cling
<dt>To that faith firm this splendour hath retold:
<dt>My spirit, towered, doth its sheer track behold,
<dt>And shakes the dust of chaos from its wing.
<dt>Life that is death, riches named with a lie,
<dt>This fane would, that the sum of both employs,
<dt>Your tears unseal if ignorance could weep.
<dt>Is not true being locked in tombs? and die
<dt>Must not we in death ere life's innater joys
<dt>We may, as I now, clasp as in a sleep?
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Life and Death</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>This world is driven by two contending powers--
<dt>Love, that coerceth Heaven to dwell with dust,
<dt>And that dire pledge of Hell's self-perjured Lust--
<dt>And as we list must Heaven and Hell be ours.
<dt>Not light the election runs: lo, each devours
<dt>That savour set in each, while equal gust
<dt>Each uses; yet our choice support we must--
<dt>Blest wine or, this rejected, sweat that sours.
<dt>Love, oft through Hell that seems, acclaims what Heaven!
<dt>But Lust, through seeming Heaven, with easy breath
<dt>Slides on to Hell, how soon, how richly given!
<dt>If Love to heavenly state so quickeneth,
<dt>While Lust must e'er in cheating Hell be shriven,
<dt>They sponsor what, these powers, but Life and Death?
