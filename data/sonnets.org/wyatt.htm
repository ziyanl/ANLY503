<a name="001"></a><h2>"Caesar, when that the traitor of Egypt"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Caesar, when that the traitor of Egypt,
<dt>With th'honorable head did him present,
<dt>Covering his gladness, did represent
<dt>Plaint with his tears outward, as it is writ;
<dt>And Hanniball, eke, when fortune him <a href="#999">shit</a>
<dt>Clean from his reign, and from all his intent
<dt>Laughed to his folk whom sorrow did torment,
<dt>His cruel despite for to disgorge and quit.
<dt>So chanceth it oft that every passion
<dt>The mind hideth by colour contrary
<dt>With feigned visage, now sad, now merry;
<dt>Whereby if I laughed any time or season,
<dt>It is for because I have n'other way
<dt>To cloak my care but under sport and play.
<p>
<a name="002"></a><h2>"The long love that in my heart doth harbor..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>      
</p>
<dt>The long love that in my heart doth harbor
<dt>And in mine heart doth keep his residence,
<dt>Into my face presseth with bold pretense,
<dt>And there campeth, displaying his banner.
<dt>She that me learneth to love and to suffer,
<dt>And wills that my trust and lust's negligence
<dt>Be reined by reason, shame, and reverence,
<dt>With his hardiness taketh displeasure.
<dt>Wherewith love to the heart's forest he fleeth,
<dt>Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry,
<dt>And there him hideth and not appeareth.
<dt>What may I do when my master feareth
<dt>But in the field with him to live and die?
<dt>For good is the life ending faithfully. 
<p></p>
<p><i>Note: The sonnet above is translated from Petrarch. Compare with Surrey's sonnet <a href="surrey.htm#102"> "Love that liveth and reigneth in my thought..."</a> or with a <a href="petrarch.htm">literal translation from the Italian</a>.</i></p>
<p>
<a name="003"></a><h2>"Whoso <a href="#999">list</a> to hunt, I know where is an hind..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Whoso <a href="#999">list</a> to hunt, I know where is an hind,
<dt>But as for me, alas, I may no more;
<dt>The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,
<dt>I am of them that furthest come behind.
<dt>Yet may I by no means my wearied mind
<dt>Draw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore
<dt>Fainting I follow; I leave off therefore,
<dt>Since in a net I seek to hold the wind.
<dt>Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,
<dt>As well as I, may spend his time in vain.
<dt>And graven with diamonds in letters plain,
<dt>There is written her fair neck round about,
<dt>"<a href="#999"><i>Noli me tangere</i></a>, for Caesar's I am,
<dt>And wild for to hold, though I seem tame."
<p>
<a name="004"></a><h2>"Was I never yet of your love grieved"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Was I never yet of your love grieved
<dt>Nor never shall while that my life doth last.
<dt>But of hating myself that date is past
<dt>And tears continual sore have me wearied.
<dt>I will not yet in my grave be buried
<dt>Nor on my tomb yoiur name yfixed fast
<dt>As cruel cause that did the spirit soon haste
<dt>From th'unhappy bones by great sighs stirred.
<dt>Then if an heart of amorous faith and will
<dt>May content you without doing grief,
<dt>Please it you so to this to do relief.
<dt>If otherwise ye seek for to fulfill
<dt>Your disdain, ye err and shall not as ye ween,
<dt>And ye yourself the cause thereof hath been.
<p>
<a name="005"></a><h2>"If amorous faith in heart unfeigned"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>        </p>
<dt>If amorous faith in heart unfeigned,
<dt>A sweet languor, a great lovely desire,
<dt>If honest will kindled in gentle fire,
<dt>If long error in a blind maze chained,
<dt>If in my visage each thought depainted
<dt>Or else in my sparkling voice lower or higher
<dt>Which now fear, now shame, woefully doth tire,
<dt>If a pale colour which love hath stained,
<dt>If to have another than myself more dear,
<dt>If wailing or sighing continually,
<dt>With sorrowful anger feeding busily,
<dt>If burning afar off and freezing near
<dt>Are cause that by love myself I destroy,
<dt>Yours is the fault and mine the great annoy.
<p></p>
<p>(Compare Daniel's <a href="daniel.htm#100">"If this be love, to draw a weary breath"</a>.)</p>
<p>
<a name="006"></a><h2>"My heart I gave thee, not to do it pain"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>My heart I gave thee, not to do it pain;
<dt>But to preserve, it was to thee taken.
<dt>I served thee, not to be forsaken,
<dt>But that I should be rewarded again.
<dt>I was content thy servant to remain
<dt>But not to be paid under this fashion.
<dt>Now since in thee is none other reason,
<dt>Displease thee not if that I do refrain,
<dt>Unsatiate of my woe and thy desire,
<dt>Assured by craft to excuse thy fault.
<dt>But since it please thee to feign a default,
<dt>Farewell, I say, parting from the fire:
<dt>For he that believeth bearing in hand,
<dt>Plougheth in water and soweth in the sand.
<p>
<a name="007"></a><h2>"Some fowls there be that have so perfect sight"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Some fowls there be that have so perfect sight
<dt>Again the sun their eyes for to defend;
<dt>And some because the light doth them offend
<dt>Do never 'pear but in the dark or night.
<dt>Other rejoice that see the fire bright
<dt>And ween to play in it, as they do pretend,
<dt>And find the contrary of it that they intend.
<dt>Alas, of that sort I may be by right,
<dt>For to withstand her look I am not able
<dt>And yet can I not hide me in no dark place,
<dt>Remembrance so followeth me of that face.
<dt>So that with teary eyen, swollen and unstable,
<dt>My destiny to behold her doth me lead,
<dt>Yet do I know I run into the gleed.
<p>
<a name="008"></a><h2>"Because I have thee still kept from lies and blame"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Because I have thee still kept from lies and blame
<dt>And to my power always have I thee honoured,
<dt>Unkind tongue, right ill hast thou me rendered
<dt>For such desert to do me wreak and shame.
<dt>In need of succour most when that I am
<dt>To ask reward, then standest thou like one afeard,
<dt>Alway most cold; and if thou speak toward,
<dt>It is as in dream, unperfect and lame.
<dt>And ye salt tears, again my will each night
<dt>That are with me when fain I would be alone,
<dt>Then are ye gone when I should make my moan.
<dt>And you so ready sighs to make me <a href="#999">shright</a>,
<dt>Then are ye slack when that ye should outstart,
<dt>And only my look declareth my heart.
<p>
<a name="009"></a><h2>"I find no peace, and all my war is done..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>I find no peace, and all my war is done:
<dt>I fear, and hope; I burn, and freeze like ice;
<dt>I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;
<dt>And nought I have, and all the world I seize on;
<dt>That locketh nor loseth holdeth me in prison,
<dt>And holdeth me not, yet can I 'scape nowise:
<dt>Nor letteth me live, nor die at my devise,
<dt>And yet of death it giveth me occasion.
<dt>Without eyen I see, and without tongue I 'plain;
<dt>I desire to perish, and yet I ask health;
<dt>I love another, and thus I hate myself;
<dt>I feed me in sorrow, and laugh in all my pain.
<dt>Likewise displeaseth me both death and life,
<dt>And my delight is causer of this strife.
<p>
<a name="010"></a><h2>"Though I myself be bridled of my mind"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Though I myself be bridled of my mind,
<dt>Returning me backward by force express,
<dt>If thou seek honour to keep thy promise,
<dt>Who may thee hold, my heart, but thou thyself unbind?
<dt>Sigh then no more since no way man may find
<dt>Thy virtue to let though that frowardness
<dt>Of fortune me holdeth; and yet as I may guess,
<dt>Though other be present, thou art not all behind.
<dt>Suffice it then that thou be ready there
<dt>At all hours, still under the defence
<dt>Of time, truth, and love to save thee from offence,
<dt>Crying, "I burn in a lovely desire
<dt>With my dear master's that may not follow,
<dt>Whereby his absence turneth him to sorrow."
<p>
<a name="011"></a><h2>"My galley charged with forgetfulness..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<a href="galley1.ram"><img align="right" border="0" src="raanniin.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>My galley charged with forgetfulness
<dt>Through sharp seas in winter nights doth pass
<dt>Tween rock and rock, and <a href="#999">eke</a> my foe (alas)
<dt>That is my lord, steereth with cruelness.
<dt>And every oar, a thought in readiness,
<dt>As though that death were light in such a case;
<dt>An endless wind doth tear the sail apace
<dt>Of forced sighs and trusty fearfulness;
<dt>A rain of tears, a cloud of dark distain,
<dt>Have done the wearied cords great hinderance;
<dt>Wreathed with error and eke with ignorance,
<dt>The stars be hid that lead me to this pain.
<dt>Drowned is reason that should me <a href="#999">consort</a>,
<dt>And I remain, despairing of the port.
<p>
<a name="012"></a><h2>"Avising the bright beams of these fair eyes"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt><a href="#999">Avising</a> the bright beams of these fair eyes
<dt>Where he is that mine oft moisteth and washeth,
<dt>The worried mind straight from the heart departeth
<dt>For to rest his worldly paradise
<dt>And find the sweet bitter under this guise.
<dt>What webs he hath wrought well he perceiveth,
<dt>Whereby with himself on Love he plaineth
<dt>That spurreth with fire and bridleth with ice.
<dt>Thus is it in such extremity brought:
<dt>In frozen thought now, and now it standeth in flame,
<dt>'Twixt misery and wealth, 'twixt earnest and game,
<dt>But few glad and many a diverse thought,
<dt>With sore repentance of his hardiness.
<dt>Of such a root cometh fruit fruitless.
<p>
<a name="013"></a><h2>"Ever mine hap is slack and slow in coming"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Ever mine hap is slack and slow in coming,
<dt>Desire increasing, mine hope uncertain,
<dt>That leave it or wait it doth me like pain
<dt>And tiger-like swift it is in parting.
<dt>Alas, the snow shall be black and scalding,
<dt>The sea waterless, fish in the mountain,
<dt>The Thames shall return back into his fountain,
<dt>And where he rose the sun shall take lodging
<dt>Ere that I in this find peace or quietness
<dt>In that Love or my lady rightwisely
<dt>Leave to conspire again me wrongfully.
<dt>And if that I have after such bitterness
<dt>Anything sweet, my mouth is out of taste,
<dt>That all my trust and travail is but waste.
<p>
<a name="014"></a><h2>"Love and Fortune and my mind, rememb'rer"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Love and Fortune and my mind, rememb'rer
<dt>Of that that is now with that that hath been,
<dt>Do torment me so that I very often
<dt>Envy them beyond all measure.
<dt>Love slayeth mine heart.  Fortune is depriver
<dt>Of all my comfort.  The foolish mind then
<dt>Burneth and plaineth as one that seldom
<dt>Liveth in rest, still in displeasure.
<dt>My pleasant days, they fleet away and pass,
<dt>But daily yet the ill doth change into the worse,
<dt>And more than the half is run of my course.
<dt>Alas, not of steel but of <a href="#999">brickle</a> glass
<dt>I see that from mine hand falleth my trust,
<dt>And all my thoughts are dashed into dust.
<p>
<a name="015"></a><h2>"How oft have I, my dear and cruel foe"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>How oft have I, my dear and cruel foe,
<dt>With those your eyes for to get peace and truce
<dt>Proffered you mine heart!  But you do not use
<dt>Among so high things to cast your mind so low.
<dt>If any other look for it, as ye trow,
<dt>Their vain weak hope doth greatly them abuse.
<dt>And thus I disdain that that ye refuse:
<dt>It was once mine, it can no more be so.
<dt>If I then it chase, nor it in you can find
<dt>In this exile no manner of comfort,
<dt>Nor live alone, nor, where he is called, resort,
<dt>He may wander from his natural kind.
<dt>So shall it be great hurt unto us twain
<dt>And yours the loss and mine the deadly pain.
<p>
<a name="016"></a><h2>"Like to these immeasurable mountains"</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Like to these immeasurable mountains
<dt>Is my painful life, the burden of ire:
<dt>For of great height be they and high is my desire,
<dt>And I of tears and they be full of fountains.
<dt>Under craggy rocks they have full barren plains;
<dt>Hard thoughts in me my woeful mind doth tire.
<dt>Small fruit and many leaves their tops do attire;
<dt>Small effect with great trust in me remains.
<dt>The boist'rous winds oft their high boughs do blast;
<dt>Hot sighs from me continually be shed.
<dt>Cattle in them and in me love is fed.
<dt>Immovable am I and they are full steadfast.
<dt>Of the restless birds they have the tune and note,
<dt>And I always plaints that pass thorough my throat.
<p>
<a name="103"></a><h2>"Farewell love and all thy laws forever..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Farewell, love, and all thy laws forever,
<dt>Thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more.
<dt>Senec and Plato call me from thy lore
<dt>To perfect wealth, my wit for to endeavor.
<dt>In blind error when I did persever,
<dt>Thy sharp repulse that pricketh aye so sore
<dt>Taught me in trifles that I set no store,
<dt>But scape forth, since liberty is <a href="#999">lever</a>.
<dt>Therefore, farewell, go trouble younger hearts,
<dt>And in me claim no more authority;
<dt>With idle youth go use thy property,
<dt>And thereon spend thy many brittle darts.
<dt>For hitherto though I have lost my time,
<dt>Me <a href="#999">list</a> no longer rotten boughs to climb.
<p>
<a name="105"></a><h2>"Unstable dream, according to the place..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Unstable dream, according to the place,
<dt>Be steadfast once, or else at least be true;
<dt>By tasted sweetness make me not to rue
<dt>The sudden loss of thy false feigned grace.
<dt>By good respect in such a dangerous case,
<dt>Thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew,
<dt>But madest my sprite live, my care to renew,
<dt>My body in tempest her succour to embrace.
<dt>The body dead, the sprite had his desire,
<dt>Painless was th' one, th' other in delight.
<dt>Why then, alas, did it not keep it right,
<dt>Returning, to leap into the fire?
<dt>And where it was at wish, it could not remain,
<dt>Such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain.
<p>
<a name="107"></a><h2>"Divers doth use, as I have heard and know..."</h2><a href="#top"><img align="right" border="0" src="handup.gif"></a>
<p></p>
<dt>Divers doth use, as I have heard and know,
<dt>When that to change their ladies do begin,
<dt>To mourn and wail, and never for to lin,
<dt>Hoping thereby to pease their painful woe.
<dt>And some there be, that when it chanceth so
<dt>That women change and hate where love hath been,
<dt>They call them false and think with words to win
<dt>The hearts of them which otherwhere doth grow.
<dt>But as for me, though that by chance indeed
<dt>Change hath outworn the favor that I had,
<dt>I will not wail, lament, nor yet be sad,
<dt>Nor call her false that falsely did me feed,
<dt>But let it pass, and think it is of kind
<dt>That often change doth please a woman's mind.
