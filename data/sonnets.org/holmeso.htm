<h2>Joseph Warren, M.D.</h2>
<p>
<dt>Trained in the holy art whose lifted shield
<dt>Wards off the darts a never-slumbering foe,
<dt>By hearth and wayside lurking, waits to throw.
<dt>Oppression taught his helpful arm to wield
<dt>The slayer's weapon: on the murderous field
<dt>The fiery bolt he challenged laid him low,
<dt>Seeking its noblest victim. Even so
<dt>The charter of a nation must be sealed!
<dt>The healer's brow the hero's honours crowned,
<dt>From lowliest duty called to loftiest deed.
<dt>Living, the oak-leaf wreath his temples bound;
<dt>Dying, the conqueror's laurel was his meed,
<dt>Last on the broken ramparts' turf to bleed
<dt>Where Freedom's victory in defeat was found.
