<p>
<dt>Quickly and pleasantly the seasons blow
<dt>Over the meadows of eternity,
<dt>As wave on wave the pulsings of the sea
<dt>Merge and are lost, each in the other's flow.
<dt>Time is no lover; it is only he
<dt>That is the one unconquerable foe,
<dt>He is the sudden tempest none can know,
<dt>Winged with swift winds that none may hope to flee.
<p>
<dt>Fair child of loveliness, these endless fears
<dt>Are nought to us; let us be gods of stone,
<dt>And set our images beyond the years
<dt>On some high mount where we can be alone;
<dt>And thou shalt ever be as now thou art,
<dt>And I shall watch thee with untroubled heart.
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>II. "The golden spring redeems the withered year"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The golden spring redeems the withered year,
<dt>And wherefore should my spirit be afraid
<dt>Though autumn winds wail through the smoky shade
<dt>And chill me like the fleeting ghost of fear?
<dt>Sweet love of youth, I know that thou must fade,
<dt>I know what nameless spectres hover near,
<dt>And that the loveliness I hold so dear,
<dt>Borrowed from dust, to ashes must be paid.
<p>
<dt>Yet linger still over these wasted meadows
<dt>Faint shreds of song, and scattered scents of flowers,
<dt>And from the heart's abyss of deepening shadows
<dt>Rise the young passions of immortal hours.
<dt>The golden spring its withered year redeems;
<dt>Sleep comes at last, but sleep made rich with dreams.
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>III. "Then judge me as thou wilt, I cannot flee"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Then judge me as thou wilt, I cannot flee,
<dt>I cannot turn away from thee forever,
<dt>For there are bonds that wisdom cannot sever,
<dt>And slaves with souls far freer than the free.
<dt>Such strong desires the Universal Giver
<dt>With unknown plan has buried deep in me,
<dt>That the passionate joy of watching thee
<dt>Has dominated all my life's endeavor.
<p>
<dt>Thou weariest of having me so near,
<dt>I feel the scorn thou hast within thy heart,
<dt>And yet, the face has never seemed so dear
<dt>As now, when I am minded to depart.
<dt>Though thou shalt drive me hence, I love thee so
<dt>That I shall watch thee when thou dost not know.
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>IV. "To make my days impatient with unrest"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>To make my days impatient with unrest,
<dt>To filch the quiet of the dark's repose,
<dt>Seeking forever what my soul well knows
<dt>Is ever far beyond my farthest quest;--
<dt>So this is love; swift joys and lingering woes,
<dt>A wistful kiss beneath the ashen west,
<dt>Farewell and greeting, mouth to mouth once pressed,
<dt>And then the empty darkness onward flows.
<p>
<dt>The heights that I have won do not endure,
<dt>They shrink beneath the stars I yearn to win,
<dt>The triumphs of my passion only lure
<dt>My vagrant feet to tread the verge of sin;
<dt>Though well I know that when I fall thereover,
<dt>Love will fly hence; the loved one and the lover.
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>V. "I cannot yet admit unchecked despair"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I cannot yet admit unchecked despair
<dt>Since now my heart this unknown conflict wages,
<dt>I know not what the endless strife presages,
<dt>I dare not welcome hope, nor exile care.
<dt>For love with fear and hope with grief engages,
<dt>And I the burden of the battle bear;
<dt>Friends there are none, foes I have everywhere,
<dt>Hope lies, grief stabs, and still the combat rages.
<p>
<dt>And thou, sweet monarch of my love, hast wrought
<dt>This ruin on my land of Venily,
<dt>And sown rebellion in my humblest thought,
<dt>Making my dreams deal traitorously with me;
<dt>But stay, I would not that this struggle cease,
<dt>For having thee is better far than peace.
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>VI. "How should I think of thee but with delight?"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How should I think of thee but with delight?
<dt>How should I greet thy face but with a smile?
<dt>And yet dark tears within my heart defile
<dt>The dreams of thee that I would have so bright.
<dt>If thou shouldst come and end this lonely while,
<dt>These leaden hours of the sleepless night,
<dt>Still should I fear to show thee what I write,
<dt>Lest I repent in vain, and thou revile.
<p>
<dt>Yet couldst thou read these scriptures of my heart,
<dt>Graven in passion with no base control,
<dt>For one brief moment, then, they might impart
<dt>Some almost worthy offering from my soul.
<dt>I write for thee, and cannot let thee read,
<dt>Thus love denies itself its utmost need.
<p>
<a name=007></a><h2>VII. "How strange it is that thine ethereal grace"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How strange it is that thine ethereal grace
<dt>Should make me sorry by its loveliness,
<dt>For surely beauty is designed to bless
<dt>Those hours of youth that have so short a race,
<dt>And yet the memory of some old distress
<dt>Shadows me over when I see thy face,
<dt>And yearning ever for one swift embrace
<dt>Has tinged my joy in thee with bitterness.
<p>
<dt>The young smiles flashing brightly free and fair,
<dt>The laughing stars that in thy deep eyes shine,--
<dt>It is not love for me that lights them there,
<dt>I see their beauty, but they are not mine.
<dt>Thy loveliness is joy poisoned with pain;
<dt>Rapture to love, torment to love in vain.
<p>
<a name=008></a><h2>VIII. "The rising deluges of circumstance"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The rising deluges of circumstance
<dt>Have flooded all the gardens of my dreams,
<dt>No more the inner sun of gladness gleams
<dt>Upon pale flowers of a lover's trance.
<dt>Dear Love, I know not why this torrent seems
<dt>To drown in turbid billowings of chance
<dt>The blossoms of thy visioned countenance,
<dt>Soiling my richest thoughts with earthy streams.
<p>
<dt>The river of the world is ever strong,
<dt>I would that I could leave this doubtful shore,
<dt>And yet I linger, hoping that ere long
<dt>The swirling tide will crush my dreams no more.
<dt>And if my gardens ever bloom again,
<dt>How fair will be thy perfect blossom then!
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>IX. "I love devoutly; thou shalt seek for long"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I love devoutly; thou shalt seek for long
<dt>Ere thou receive another offering
<dt>Such as these passionate tributes that I bring
<dt>With all the deep submission of the strong.
<dt>I would that all my chants of thee could ring
<dt>Through the great sorrows of the nameless throng,
<dt>And that thy beauty echoing in my song
<dt>Could wake the weary city into spring.
<p>
<dt>Since thou hast changed my life, and in my heart
<dt>Hast deep implanted this new love of life,
<dt>Perchance these phantoms of thee will impart
<dt>Beauty and courage to a world at strife.
<dt>And yet I tarry long, in fear to share
<dt>With common men a song of one so fair.
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>X. "Let those who love hear me; I speak as one"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Let those who love hear me; I speak as one
<dt>Who hath known every portion of love's pain,
<dt>And all the swift delights that flare and wane
<dt>Between the setting and the rising sun.
<dt>Sins have I known whose sweetness left no stain,
<dt>And virtues that much villainy have done,
<dt>But now the pattern that my heart has spun
<dt>Is finished, and I see that it is vain.
<p>
<dt>Vain is the virgin kiss, and vain the thought
<dt>That binds the heart's desire from afar,
<dt>Each loves the image his own mind has wrought,
<dt>Each worships no true spirit, but a star.
<dt>By none is this believed until the years
<dt>Reveal the sad deception, and with tears.
<p>
<a name=011></a><h2>XI. "We have come back to one another; yes"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>We have come back to one another; yes,
<dt>After long languishing in spheres apart,
<dt>Thou hast returned, since Love's own self thou art,
<dt>And I in penitence and fearfulness.
<dt>O gentle Love, that leaves me not to smart
<dt>Forever in the clutches of distress,
<dt>When with a kindly pardon thou canst bless
<dt>Consummately my long-disconsolate heart,
<p>
<dt>Forgive me yet again, if to this joy
<dt>I do not rise at once from melancholy,
<dt>Mine was the utmost sin thus to destroy
<dt>Our calm devotion with unbridled folly;
<dt>Bear with me yet awhile until I prove
<dt>The tenderness of all-repentant love.
<p>
<a name=012></a><h2>XII. "I will fling wide the windows of my soul"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I will fling wide the windows of my soul
<dt>Under the deep hush of nocturnal skies,
<dt>When the white legions of the stars arise
<dt>And write their secrets on the Master's scroll.
<dt>I will go forth and watch with slumberous eyes
<dt>The languid billows of the ocean roll
<dt>In silver rhythms on some hidden shoal,
<dt>Swelling with laughter, falling back with sighs.
<p>
<dt>And in the tranquil twilight of that place,
<dt>The lovely solitude of lonely sands,
<dt>Will flash the pale resplendence of thy grace
<dt>In sudden beauty out of other lands,
<dt>And I will kneel and kiss thine ivory hands
<dt>Beneath the flowered music of thy face.
<p>
<a name=013></a><h2>XIII. "Poor faltering lines, my weary soul's relief"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Poor faltering lines, my weary soul's relief,
<dt>The balm of passion, opiate of pain.
<dt>A mightier hand than mine, a mightier brain,
<dt>Had wrought in you an immemorial grief.
<dt>But though my love and art both prove in vain,
<dt>Wither and die with me, I had as lief
<dt>That it were so; respite however brief
<dt>Is all-sufficient to the living-slain.
<p>
<dt>For separate voices sink at eventide,
<dt>And none survives the creeping hush of time,
<dt>Nought lives but life; the fame of them that died
<dt>Brings back no vestige of their lovely prime,
<dt>Fame and oblivion shall merge again
<dt>In nameless loves and laughter, tears and pain.
<p>
<a name=014></a><h2>XIV. "Let all men see the ruins of the shrine"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Let all men see the ruins of the shrine
<dt>That I, with passionate and holy care,
<dt>Built long ago from laughter and despair
<dt>That godly love might have a fane divine.
<dt>Let the wide wings of darkness hover where
<dt>The god of youth once drank his rarest wine,
<dt>And let the rank breath of some poisoned vine
<dt>Choke the last sigh that lingers on the air.
<p>
<dt>Hurl the white sanctuary down, and bare
<dt>Its inmost secrets to the gaze of men,
<dt>Unveil the altar to the vulgar stare,
<dt>And let none seek it build it up agin;--
<dt>Ah, when the last wall crumbles, stone by stone,
<dt>I shall go hence that I may weep alone.
<p>
<a name=015></a><h2>XV. "How oft the traitor trumpet sounds retreat"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How oft the traitor trumpet sounds retreat,
<dt>Beguiling my bewildered soul again,
<dt>When all the forces on the battle-plain
<dt>Are ready to do homage at my feet;
<dt>And when I fight with strength, it is in vain,
<dt>For then I find no foe before my eyes,
<dt>They lurk in shadow, waiting to surprise
<dt>My soul when it is weary and in pain.
<p>
<dt>How shall I gauge the conflict and the odds,
<dt>Misled and blinded in the midst of strife?
<dt>How shall I know mine enemy? O gods,
<dt>Grant me one moment worthy of my life,
<dt>To see at last beyond the dust and shade,
<dt>And face real foemen, strong and unafraid.
<p>
<a name=016></a><h2>XVI. "Even as love grows more, I write the less"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Even as love grows more, I write the less,
<dt>Impelled to speak, unable still to voice
<dt>The lyric thoughts like angels that rejoice
<dt>Attendant on thy godly loveliness.
<dt>Stay the bright swallow high in airy poise,
<dt>Carve out of stone an infinite caress,
<dt>Garner the fruits of tears and happiness,
<dt>Make bloom forever what an hour destroys,
<p>
<dt>Then shamed by such unprecedented skill
<dt>I may find words to name thee, and to sing
<dt>Such praises of thy beauty as shall fill
<dt>The listening world with floods of carolling;
<dt>Till then thou art like starlight on the air,
<dt>Or clouds at dawn, unutterably fair.
<p>
<a name=017></a><h2>XVII. "Voice that art life to me, I almost hear"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Voice that art life to me, I almost hear
<dt>Thy sweet familiar cadence on the breeze,
<dt>At times a far call infinitely clear;
<dt>Face that art love to me, my spirit sees
<dt>In each unfolding bud of the young year
<dt>Imperfect shadows of thy grace appear,
<dt>For thou, dear one, art fairer than all these;
<p>
<dt>Soul that art part of me, at last I know
<dt>What murmurs on the wakening breezes blow,
<dt>What hand of ivory pours out the wine
<dt>Filling the cup of spring to overflow;
<dt>All beauty mirrors what is only thine,
<dt>And thou the source not mortal, but divine.
<p>
<a name=018></a><h2>XVIII. "Lovely art thou, and everything of thine"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Lovely art thou, and everything of thine
<dt>Reflects the glory of thy noble grace;
<dt>That thou shouldst have returned my swift embrace
<dt>Has made me feel that I too am divine.
<dt>My spirit met thy spirit face to face,
<dt>Thy godlike heart has not rejected mine,
<dt>And I have been uplifted in the shrine,
<dt>And high exalted in the holy place.
<p>
<dt>Think not that thou or I shall ever fade
<dt>Forgotten in the silence of the years;
<dt>We are but one, this world of myth and shade
<dt>Shall not appall us with its dusty fears;
<dt>If Death should find the hearts whom Love hath kissed,
<dt>We never met, and nothing doth exist.
<p>
<a name=019></a><h2>XIX. "Although the spring is hastening to pursue"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Although the spring is hastening to pursue
<dt>The swift white deer of winter through the glades,
<dt>Sometimes they pause for breath beneath the shades;
<dt>Then blows the frozen hurricane anew.
<dt>And so the chill of thy neglect invades
<dt>My heart, in which of late a timid few
<dt>Flowers began to spring, until there blew
<dt>This sudden storm, blighting the tender blades.
<p>
<dt>But when April at last shall put to flight
<dt>The pallid cohorts of the lingering snow,
<dt>And every leaf lifts upward to the light,
<dt>And every spirit blossoms from its woe,
<dt>Ah, then relent, and let me have my share
<dt>Of joy, and rise up radiant from care.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>XX. "To walk beside the river in the dawn"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>To walk beside the river in the dawn
<dt>Is fair indeed when spring is in the breeze,
<dt>Bird-carollings, the mumbling hum of bees
<dt>Sing matins from the dew-bespangled lawn;
<dt>And dancing there behind those druid trees,
<dt>Lurks in delight a little singing faun,
<dt>Who laughs at us, and yet is always gone
<dt>When we would trace his scattered melodies.
<p>
<dt>Alone, dear love, with thee and the new day,
<dt>Now am I radiant like the golden fields,
<dt>No distant longing and no dim dismay,
<dt>Nought but the gladness that the hour yields.
<dt>To walk beside the river is most fair
<dt>When Love is young and spring is in the air!
<p>
<a name=021></a><h2>XXI. "Two lovers stood alone beneath the night"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Two lovers stood alone beneath the night,
<dt>And, quickened with a sudden strength, one said,
<dt>"To-night is ours to snatch from out the dead
<dt>An immortality of vast delight.
<dt>When Youth has felt the touch of time and fled,
<dt>When Love in chill despair has taken flight,
<dt>There is one joy that knows not change nor blight,--
<dt>Ah, kiss me, ere the fleeting hour be sped!"
<p>
<dt>The hovering moon leaned low in rapt desire,
<dt>Two souls uprose beyond oblivion,
<dt>A shout triumphal shook the starry choir,
<dt>Then sacred silence fell, until the sun
<dt>Gazed like a victor, as he gazes now,
<dt>On the new day and the undying vow.
<p>
<a name=022></a><h2>XXII. "Fly, joyous wind, through all the wakened earth"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Fly, joyous wind, through all the wakened earth,
<dt>Now when the portals of the dawn outpour
<dt>Laughter and radiant sunlight from the store
<dt>Of spring's glad passion and loud-ringing mirth.
<dt>Cry to the world that I despair no more;
<dt>Heart greets my heart, and hope has proved its worth;
<dt>Fly where the meadows swell in flowery birth,
<dt>Chant everywhere, and everywhere adore.
<p>
<dt>Circle the basking hills in fragrant flight,
<dt>Shout "Rapture! Rapture!" if sweet sorrow passes,
<dt>And whisper low in intimate delight
<dt>My love-song to the undulating grasses.
<dt>Grief is no more, Love rises with the spring,
<dt>O fly, free wind, and "Rapture! Rapture!" sing.
<p>
<a name=023></a><h2>XXIII. "Over the waters but a single bough"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Over the waters but a single bough
<dt>Stretches in silhouette against the moon,
<dt>The little dark waves haunt the dim lagoon
<dt>And splash against the languid-moving prow.
<dt>I should have left thee when the afternoon
<dt>Surrendered to pursuing night, for now
<dt>Too perilously dear and fair art thou,
<dt>And love too soon invoked shall die too soon.
<p>
<dt>I fear the very floods of happiness
<dt>That swell the narrow chambers of my heart,
<dt>Knowing indeed that with our first caress,
<dt>Contentment and my soul forever part;
<dt>O night of love and beauty, all the years
<dt>Shall pay for thy brief ecstasy with tears.
<p>
<a name=024></a><h2>XXIV. "There was a boy in some forgotten spring"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There was a boy in some forgotten spring
<dt>Who fled from all his comrades at the school,
<dt>And in the hills beside a forest pool
<dt>Lay on the grass, watching, and listening.
<dt>And as he listened, melancholy delight
<dt>Stirred in his heart a pang he did not know,
<dt>And voices of new passion bade him write
<dt>Of the vague thoughts that shook his spirit so.
<p>
<dt>Now on the battlefield of later times,
<dt>I meet those dreams returning in the forms
<dt>Of mighty friends and foes amid the strife;
<dt>And reading those imperfect boyish rhymes,
<dt>I hear through the blown dust of many storms
<dt>The hymns of the advance-guard of my life.
<p>
<a name=025></a><h2>XXV. "Now would that thou wert here, my happiness"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Now would that thou wert here, my happiness,
<dt>Here in the flesh, or else completely gone
<dt>Out of my life, out of my thoughts withdrawn,
<dt>And memory clean of love and old distress.
<dt>Night dreams in pain of thee, and on that lawn
<dt>Where we would sit at eventide, and press
<dt>Heart against heart, only white loneliness
<dt>Stretches beneath the winter's cheerless dawn.
<p>
<dt>Thou woundest me with absence, all the air
<dt>Seems echoing thy name, and through the day
<dt>I woo forgetfulness, but unaware
<dt>My thoughts return to our farewell caress.
<dt>Now would that thou wert here, my happiness,
<dt>Joy dwells with thee, and thou art far away.
<p>
<a name=026></a><h2>XXVI. "What though the night be dissonant with rain"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What though the night be dissonant with rain,
<dt>And roofs drip in a mournful monotone
<dt>On the deserted streets, and breezes moan
<dt>Over the naked boughs like ghosts in pain;
<dt>Yet are there voices through the darkness blown
<dt>From some remote celestial domain
<dt>That hint of peace, and scatter all the vain
<dt>Questions that mock the soul brooding alone.
<p>
<dt>All nights are beautiful, but in the warm
<dt>Wet darkness that knows neither stars nor moon,
<dt>Whose bells half-heard through the complaining storm
<dt>Bind the wind's discords in harmonious tune,
<dt>The soul withdraws into its cave of rest,
<dt>And dreams long dreams, well-loved, but not expressed.

<dt>About the headlands and the rocky shoals
<dt>I hear the breath of twilight, sighing, sighing,
<dt>And over the wail and dash of breakers, crying,
<dt>The voices of old ships and wandering souls.
<dt>Through the wet air squadrons of gulls are flying,
<dt>Wheeling but once against the skies, then tossed
<dt>Into the wind like a flight of visions lost
<dt>With vanished souls into the darkness dying.
<p>
<dt>O harp of the winds singing above the dead,
<dt>O rush of wings over the turbulent deep,
<dt>Pray for the spirits uncompanioned,
<dt>The dreams returned into oblivion,
<dt>The men drifting far from the stars and sun,
<dt>Lost in a lonely night and a loveless sleep.

<p>
<dt>The insurgent sea sweeps through the barrier
<dt>Triumphant, all its foaming strength amassed
<dt>In one tempestuous tide, wallowing past
<dt>The broken banks and the worn dykes that were
<dt>Upbuilt by coward hearts; sated at last
<dt>It settles in calm pools about the bar,
<dt>So that at twilight the young evening star
<dt>Beholds its image in still waters cast.
<p>
<dt>Against unyielding shores I too have striven,
<dt>And won at last like the uprising sea,
<dt>And sink to rest beneath a quiet heaven,
<dt>After long struggles, a long victory;
<dt>But my star vanishes, its light withdrawn,
<dt>And darkness falls unpromising of dawn.

<p>
<dt>Speak not of waning love and changing days,
<dt>Youth may be short and life may not endure,
<dt>Yet with a strength unslacked, a vision sure,
<dt>My love companions thee in all thy ways.
<dt>Whither thou wanderest in times unsure
<dt>Of peace, however far thy spirit strays
<dt>From love of me, my spirit ever stays
<dt>Close to thy side, and there shall rest secure.
<p>
<dt>If thou shouldst weary of me, and alone
<dt>I walked with grief, yet should I be aware
<dt>How far unworthy I had been to share
<dt>In thy diviner life, or sing thy praise;
<dt>If thou shouldst hate me, yet I am thine own,--
<dt>Speak not of waning love and changing days.

<p>
<dt>Who follows Love shall walk in outland places,
<dt>Beyond the common cheer of hall and town,
<dt>He shall forget all things, the friendly faces,
<dt>The strife for wealth, the struggle for renown.
<dt>A young crusader putting by his crown,
<dt>A pilgrim following a holy vision, 
<dt>Heeding nor threat of king nor gibe of clown,
<dt>The tyrant's hatred nor the world's derision,--
<p>
<dt>Thus shall he wander; in no bright Elysian
<dt>Meadows shall be his quest, but through the vast
<dt>And midnight fears that shake his heart's decision
<dt>With staring madness, till he see at last
<dt>Like Parsifal in ages long ago,
<dt>Love's flaming chalice out of darkness glow.

<p>
<dt>Only last night we dwelt together, we
<dt>Whose lips the ultimate farewells enthrall;
<dt>Last night itself is but a stone let fall
<dt>Into the chasm of eternity.
<dt>There shall be echoes, I shall hear them call
<dt>However faint, however far they be;
<dt>There shall be shadows, I shall always see
<dt>Them beckon from Time's memory-haunted hall.
<p>
<dt>The drear mirages of the years gone by
<dt>Glow falsely golden from their dark domain,
<dt>But now they stir me not.  "Mere mockery,"
<dt>Low to my heart I say to still its pain,
<dt>And cloud-built cities in the sunset sky
<dt>Fade out in dark across the endless plain.
<p>
<a name=032></a><h2>XXXII. "Thou only wert my hope, and thou art gone"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou only wert my hope, and thou art gone.
<dt>Thou, the one star in monotones of sky,
<dt>Art vanished like a meteor, and I,
<dt>Lost in the night, have ceased to pray for dawn.
<dt>I watched thee fade, I saw thee passing by
<dt>And tried to call thee, but my lips were dumb;
<dt>It had been better hadst thou never come,--
<dt>Remembered riches mock my poverty.
<p>
<dt>Blow from afar the little sounds of bells,
<dt>Wood-smoke hangs thinly on the autumn air,
<dt>The town's unconscious hush is like a prayer,
<dt>And night sleeps pleasantly among the dells;
<dt>I only wander on, and know not where,
<dt>Through the great dark, pursued by faint farewells.
<p>
<a name=033></a><h2>XXXIII. "If in some fair Elysian seclusion"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>If in some fair Elysian seclusion
<dt>We yet shall find the dreams that we have wrought
<dt>To guide our souls while the dark strife is fought
<dt>Amongst these shades moving in black confusion,
<dt>If with our finite sorrows we have bought
<dt>Infinite joy, safe from the world's intrusion,
<dt>And in this wilderness of blind delusion
<dt>Have sought one vision worthy to be sought,
<p>
<dt>Then we are not irrevocably parted,
<dt>But fighting upward, each in his own fashion,
<dt>From mortal dust to an immortal passion,
<dt>Separate in earthly chance, yet single-hearted,
<dt>We that in steep and lonely paths have trod,
<dt>At dawn shall meet before the face of God.
<p>
<a name=034></a><h2>XXXIV. "Long after both of us are scattered dust"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Long after both of us are scattered dust,
<dt>And alien souls, perchance, shall read of thee,
<dt>Guessing the passions that have crushed from me
<dt>These poor confessions of my love and trust;
<dt>Ah, well I know how heartless they will be,
<dt>For some will laugh, and others, more unjust,
<dt>Whose minds know not of love, but only lust,
<dt>Will stain the vesture of our memory.
<p>
<dt>And yet a few there may be who will feel
<dt>My true devotion and my deep desires,
<dt>And know that these unhappy lines reveal
<dt>Only new images in changeless fires;
<dt>And they, indeed, will linger with a sigh
<dt>To think that beauty such as thine must die.
