<a name=010></a><h2>The Muse</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>"The man that's poor and prosecutes the muse,"
<dt>Said I, "alas! is like to lose his cause."
<dt>So I resolved with her to have a truce,
<dt>Quite well aware I could not learn her laws.
<dt>Though some assert that hers, like ours, have flaws
<dt>Which let her pleaders 'peach. I'm even content
<dt>To own her power and give my bickerings pause,
<dt>A liegeman to her gambol government.

<dt>For late, as sauntering through the woods I went,
<dt>She met me smiling. "Come," said I, "let's plight
<dt>Our troth again." Quoth she (with lips up-bent):
<dt>"We're not so near akin but what we might!"
<dt>So now we lead a joyous jangling life,
<dt>And kiss and quarrel--just like man and wife.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>May</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Sure, merry May, thy reign is near allied
<dt>To that of early love.--Thy subjects play
<dt>Blushing in bloom; and pranked in frolic pride
<dt>Right freshly shines thy blithe and breezy day.
<dt>In the green shade that scarce excludes the ray,
<dt>The insect hum is up; the brilliant fly
<dt>Lights on a sunny leaf and glistens gay;
<dt>While the coy blackcap warbles wildly nigh.
<p>
<dt>Quick shoots the gossamer all reddening bright
<dt>With sunny glance: the sharp-winged swallows high
<dt>Sail nimbly: and full many a flowret's eye
<dt>Looks eager on thy realm with flush delight.
<dt>Sure thou art akin to love, sweet May.--And I
<dt>Perchance could tell some other reason why.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Sonnet</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There are who say the sonnet's meted maze
<dt>Is all too fettered for the poet's powers,
<dt>Compelled to crowd his flush and airy flowers
<dt>Like pots of tall imperials, ill at ease.
<dt>Or should some tiny thought his fancy seize,
<dt>A violet on a vase's top it towers,
<dt>And mid the mass of leaves he round it showers
<dt>Its little cap and tippet scarce can raise.
<p>
<dt>Others assert the sonnet's proper praise,
<dt>Like petalled flowers to each its due degree;
<dt>The king-cup five, the pilewort eight bright rays,
<dt>The speedwell four, the green-tipped snowdrop three:
<dt>So mid the bard's all-petalled sorts is seen
<dt>The sonnet--simple flowret of fourteen.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>To Mr John Hamilton Reynolds, Author of "Safie" and Other Poems</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Reynolds, no more as erst two frolic boys
<dt>By Severn's side our school-day tricks we try,
<dt>For me now holds the love of rural joys,
<dt>Thee city pomp, light sock, and buskin high.
<dt>Yet distance dares not bid us leave to ply
<dt>The social sheet, or court our mutual muse,
<dt>For distance cannot time-tied souls untie
<dt>Nor dim the long horizon of their views.
<p>
<dt>But never let my woods their leafage lose
<dt>Till thou hast there admired ripe August glow;
<dt>Nor shall in turn my friendly foot refuse
<dt>To beat thy threshold with December's snow.
<dt>So shalt thou love my rural joys: and I
<dt>Approve thy scenic pomp, light sock, and buskin high.
