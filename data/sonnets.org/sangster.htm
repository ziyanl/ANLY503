<h3>I</h3>
<p>
<dt>My footsteps press where, centuries ago,
<dt>The Red Men fought and conquered; lost and won.
<dt>Whole tribes and races, gone like last year's snow,
<dt>Have found the Eternal Hunting-Grounds, and run
<dt>The fiery gauntlet of their active days,
<dt>Till few are left to tell the mournful tale:
<dt>And these inspire us with such wild amaze
<dt>They seem like spectres passing down a vale
<dt>Steeped in uncertain moonlight, on their way
<dt>Towards some bourn where darkness blinds the day,
<dt>And night is wrapped in mystery profound.
<dt>We cannot lift the mantle of the past:
<dt>We seem to wander over hallowed ground:
<dt>We scan the trail of Thought, but all is overcast.
<p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>
<dt><i>There was a time</i>--and that is all we know!
<dt>No record lives of their ensanguined deeds:
<dt>The past seems palsied with some giant blow,
<dt>And grows the more obscure on what it feeds.
<dt>A rotted fragment of a human leaf;
<dt>A few stray skulls: a heap of human bones!
<dt>These are the records--the traditions brief--
<dt>'Twere easier far to read the speechless stones.
<dt>The fierce Ojibwas, with tornado force,
<dt>Striking white terror to the hearts of braves!
<dt>The mighty Hurons, rolling on their course,
<dt>Compact and steady as the ocean waves!
<dt>The stately Chippewas, a warrior host!
<dt>Who were they?--Whence?--And why? no human tongue can boast.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>In the Forest</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>There is no sadness here. Oh, that my heart
<dt>Were calm and peaceful as these dreamy groves!
<dt>That all my hopes and passions, and deep loves,
<dt>Could sit in such an atmosphere of peace,
<dt>Where no unholy impulses would start
<dt>Responsive to the throes that never cease
<dt>To keep my spirit in such wild unrest.
<dt>'Tis only in the struggling human breast
<dt>That the true sorrow lives. Our fruitful joys
<dt>Have stony kernels hidden in their core.
<dt>Life in a myriad phases passeth here,
<dt>And death as various--an equal poise;
<dt>Yet all is but a solemn change--no more;
<dt>And not a sound save joy pervades the atmosphere.
