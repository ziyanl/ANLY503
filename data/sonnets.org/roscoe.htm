<a name=010></a><h2>To the Harvest Moon</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Again thou reignest in thy golden hall,
<dt>Rejoicing in thy sway, fair queen of night!
<dt>The ruddy reapers hail thee with delight,
<dt>Theirs is the harvest, theirs the joyous call
<dt>For tasks well ended ere the season's fall.
<dt>Sweet orb, thou smilest from thy starry height,
<dt>But whilst on them thy beams are shedding bright,
<dt>To me thou comest overshadowed with a pall:
<dt>To me alone the year hath fruitless flown,
<dt>Earth hath fulfilled her trust through all her lands,
<dt>The good man gathereth now where he had sown,
<dt>And the great master in his vineyard stands;
<dt>But I, as if my task were all unknown,
<dt>Come to his gates, alas, with empty hands.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>To My Father</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Stay thine overshadowing wings, relentless Time,
<dt>Nor shed those auburn locks with falling gray,
<dt>That over my father's frownless forehead play
<dt>Graceful and fair, as in youth's golden prime.
<dt>Stay thy rude hand, and he through many a clime
<dt>Shall teach thee to retrace thy distant way
<dt>To the bright regions of historic day!
<dt>Or he shall charm thee with prophetic rhyme
<dt>Swept from the strings of freedom's holy lyre,
<dt>Or call the muses from the Ausonian land,
<dt>And with the strain their breathing lips inspire,
<dt>Win thy cold ear, and check thy ebbing sand!
<dt>Vain is my prayer--already over my sire
<dt>Thou, ruthless power, hast stretched thine iron hand!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>On Being Forced to Part with His Library for the Benefit of Creditors</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As one who destined from his friends to part,
<dt>Regrets his loss, yet hopes again ere-while
<dt>To share their converse and enjoy their smile,
<dt>And tempers, as he may, affliction's dart,--
<dt>Thus, loved asociates! chiefs of elder art!
<dt>Teachers of wisdom! who could once beguile
<dt>My tedious hours, and lighten every toil,
<dt>I now resign you; nor with fainting heart--
<dt>For pass a few short years, or days, or hours,
<dt>And happier seasons may their dawn unfold,
<dt>And all your sacred fellowship restore;
<dt>When, freed from earth, unlimited its powers,
<dt>Mind shall with mind direct communion hold,
<dt>And kindred spirits meet to part no more.
