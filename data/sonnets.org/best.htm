<a name=100></a><h2>A Sonnet of the Moon</h2>
<p>
<dt>Look how the pale queen of the silent night
<dt>Doth cause the ocean to attend upon her,
<dt>And he, as long as she is in his sight,
<dt>With her full tide is ready her to honor.
<dt>But when the silver waggon of the moon
<dt>Is mounted up so high he cannot follow,
<dt>The sea calls home his crystal waves to moan,
<dt>And with low ebb doth manifest his sorrow.
<dt>So you that are the sovereign of my heart
<dt>Have all my joys attending on your will;
<dt>My joys low-ebbing when you do depart,
<dt>When you return their tide my heart doth fill.
<dt>So as you come and as you do depart,
<dt>Joys ebb and flow within my tender heart.
