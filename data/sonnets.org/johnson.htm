<p>It is generally believed that the <a href="#100">"Destroyer of a Soul"</a> was <a href="wilde.htm">Oscar Wilde</a>. The soul was that of <a href="douglas.htm">Lord Alfred Douglas</a>. Johnson had introduced the two. Johnson's verse is often described as deliberately old-fashioned, orderly, precise, and classical. These qualities seem especially apparent in  <a href=#300">The Age of a Dream</a> (which is in hexameter) and  ran counter to the Impressionist/Decadent movement of the 1890s.  Perhaps ironically, he died of a stroke after falling off a barstool in 1902.

<h3>To ------------</h3>
<p>
<dt>I hate you with a necessary hate.
<dt>First, I sought patience: passionate was she:
<dt>My patience turned in very scorn of me,
<dt>That I should dare forgive a sin so great,
<dt>As this, through which I sit disconsolate;
<dt>Mourning for that live soul, I used to see;
<dt>Soul of a saint, whose friend I used to be:
<dt>Till you came by! a cold, corrupting, fate.
<p>
<dt>Why come you now?  You, whom I cannot cease
<dt>With pure and perfect hate to hate? Go, ring
<dt>The death-bell with a deep, triumphant toll!
<dt>Say you, my friend sits by me still? Ah, peace!
<dt>Call you this thing my friend? this nameless thing?
<dt>This living body, hiding its dead soul?
<p>
<a name=200></a><H2>Doctor Major</H2>
<h3>To Dr. Birbeck Hill</h3>
<p>
<dt>Why, no Sir! If a barren rascal cries,
<dt>That he is most in love with pleasing woe,
<dt>'Tis plain, Sir! what to think of him: We know
<dt>The dog lies; and the dog, too, knows he lies.
<dt>Sir! if he's happy, he will dry his eyes,
<dt>And stroll at Vauxhall for an hour or so:
<dt>If he's unhappy, it were best he go
<dt>Hang himself straight, nor pester us with sighs.
<p>
<dt>Enough, Sir! Let us have no more of it:
<dt>Your friend is little better than a Whig.
<dt>But you and I, Sir, who are men of wit,
<dt>Laugh at the follies of a canting prig.
<dt>Let those who will, Sir! to such whims submit:
<dt>No, Sir! we'll to the <i>Mitre</i>: Frank! my wig.

<h3>To Christopher Whall</h3>
<p>
<dt>Imageries of dream reveal a gracious age:
<dt>Black armour, falling lace, and altar lights at morn.
<dt>The courtesy of Saints, their gentleness and scorn,
<dt>Lights on an earth more fair, than shone from Plato's page:
<dt>The courtesy of knights, fair calm and sacred rage:
<dt>The courtesy of love, sorrow for love's sake borne.
<dt>Vanished, those high conceits! Desolate and forlorn,
<dt>We hunger against hope for that lost heritage.
<p>
<dt>Gone now, the carven work! Ruined, the golden shrine!
<dt>No more the glorious organs pour their voice divine;
<dt>No more rich frankincense drifts through the Holy Place:
<dt>Now from the broken tower, what solemn bell still tolls,
<dt>Mourning what piteous death? Answer, O saddened souls!
<dt>Who mourn the death of beauty and the death of grace.
