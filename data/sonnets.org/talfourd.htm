<dt>With no cold admiration do I gaze
<dt>Upon thy pomp of waters, matchless stream!
<dt>But home-sick fancy kindles with the beam
<dt>That on thy lucid bosom coyly plays;
<dt>And glides delighted through thy crystal ways
<dt>Till on her eye those wave-fed poplars gleam,
<dt>Beneath whose shade her first etherial maze
<dt>She fashioned; where she traced in clearest dream
<dt>Thy mirrored curse of wood-enshrined repose
<dt>Besprent with island haunts of spirits bright;
<dt>And widening on--till, at the vision's close,
<dt>Great London, only then a name of might
<dt>For childish thought to build on, proudly rose
<dt>A rock-throned city clad in heavenly light.
