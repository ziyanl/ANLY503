<h2>High Summer</h2>
<P>
<dt>I never wholly feel that summer is high,
<dt>However green the trees, or loud the birds,
<dt>However movelessly eye-winking herds
<dt>Stand in field ponds, or under large trees lie,
<dt>Till I do climb all cultured pastures by,
<dt>That hedged by hedgerows studiously fretted trim,
<dt>Smile like a lady's face with lace laced prim,
<dt>And on some moor or hill that seeks the sky
<dt>Lonely and nakedly,--utterly lie down,
<dt>And feel the sunshine throbbing on body and limb,
<dt>My drowsy brain in pleasant drunkenness swim,
<dt>Each rising thought sink back and dreamily drown,
<dt>Smiles creep o'er my face, and smother my lips, and cloy,
<dt>Each muscle sink to itself, and separately enjoy.
</P>
