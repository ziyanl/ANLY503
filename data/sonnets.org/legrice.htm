<a name=010></a><h2>The Genius of Chatterton</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I've viewed the pit where as in scorn were thrown
<dt>The bones of Chatterton; and here I see
<dt>Where first the muses marked him for their own,
<dt>Emerging from the dawn of infancy.--
<dt>Children! He once was blithe as now ye are,
<dt>The life-beam glittering in his ardent eye:
<dt>But guilt and melancholy and despair,
<dt>Pointing their future prey, passed darkling by.
<p>
<dt>Ah! what is genius? It is a burning brand
<dt>Like that the cherub bore to guard the way
<dt>To Paradise. If grace support the hand
<dt>That wields it, then its radiant flame shall play
<dt>In glory round; else shall its lightnings burst,
<dt>And strike their victim down--scathed and accursed.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Mount's Bay</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Bay of the Mount! whose opening coasts are spread
<dt>From Mousehole Island to the twin-starred Lizard,
<dt>Whose waves are speckled with the mullet red,
<dt>From head to tail all good--except the gizzard;
<dt>Whose sons the patriotic flame display
<dt>Which warmed the breast of Hampdens and of Sidneys,
<dt>Whose sloping headlands with potatoes gay
<dt>Bloom with the scarlet robe, and silvery kidneys:
<dt>O! land of yellow ling, and powdered hake!
<dt>O! cornucopia of clouted cream;
<dt>O! nurse of matrons skilled the pie to bake
<dt>Beneath the furze-fired kettle! Not a ream
<dt>Of folio paper from the stores of Hewett,
<dt>If I could write thy praise, would give me room to do it.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>On Charles Lamb Leading his Sister to the Asylum</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>An angel's wing is waving over their head
<dt>While they, the brother and the sister, walk
<dt>Nor dare, as heedless of its fanning, talk
<dt>Of woes, which are not buried with the dead.
<dt>Hand clasped in hand they move; adown their cheek,
<dt>From the full heart-spring, tears overflowing gush;
<dt>Close and more close they clasp, as if to speak
<dt>Would wake the sorrows which they seek to hush.
<p>
<dt>Down to the mansion slow their footsteps tend,
<dt>Where blank despair is soothed by mercy's spell,
<dt>Pausing in momentary prayer to bend
<dt>Ere the cheered sister passes to her cell,
<dt>Sure in the hope that yet there will be given
<dt>Calm and sweet hours of peace--foretastes of heaven.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>In Reminiscence of the Poet Coleridge</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Coleridge, of boyhood in the early dawn
<dt>Oppressed I felt not, nor of hope forlorn,
<dt>Grasping your hand. You spoke, as though our school
<dt>Were of a separate world the vestibule;
<dt>And we its habitants.--In cloistered walk
<dt>While such of opening scenes your cherished talk,
<dt>I listened breathless;--and I saw you prove
<dt>Your boded triumphs in the college grove.
<p>
<dt>Thence, by a sudden plunge, amid their strife
<dt>You sprang into the waves of this world's life;
<dt>Nor paused.--Far, far away it was mine to hear
<dt>Fame of your struggles, and the applauding cheer.
<dt>At last of wondrous boy, of bard, of sage
<dt>Sank beneath friendship's roof the sheltered age.
