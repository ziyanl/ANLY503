<p>
<dt>The leaves which in the autumn of the year
<dt>Fall auburn-tinted, leaving reft and bare
<dt>Their parent trees, in many a sheltered lair
<dt>Where Winter waits and watches, cold, austere,
<dt>Will lie in drifts; and when the snowdrops cheer
<dt>The woodland shadows, still the leaves are there,
<dt>Though through the glades the balmy southern air
<dt>And birds and boughs proclaim that Spring is here.
<p>
<dt>So lost hopes severed by the stress of life
<dt>Lie all unburied yet before our eyes,
<dt>Though none but we regard their mute decay;
<dt>And ever amid this stir and moil and strife
<dt>Fresh aims and growing purposes arise
<dt>Above the faded hopes of yesterday.
