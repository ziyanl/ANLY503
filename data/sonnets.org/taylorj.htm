<a name=010></a><h2>Mockado, Fustian, and Motley</h2>
<p>
<dt>Sweet semi-circled Cynthia played at maw,
<dt>The whilst Endymion ran the wild-goose chase:
<dt>Great Bacchus with his cross-bow killed a daw,
<dt>And sullen Saturn smiled with pleasant face:
<dt>The ninefold Bugbears of the Caspian lake
<dt>Sat whistling ebon hornpipes to their ducks;
<dt>Madge-owlet straight for joy her girdle brake,
<dt>And rugged Satyrs frisked like stags and bucks:
<dt>The untamed tumbling fifteen-footed Goat
<dt>With promulgation of the Lesbian shores
<dt>Confronted Hydra in a sculler boat,
<dt>At which the mighty mountain Taurus roars;
<dt>Meantime great Sultan Soliman was born,
<dt>And Atlas blew his rustic rumbling horn.
