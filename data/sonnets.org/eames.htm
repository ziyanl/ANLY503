<h2>The Past</h2>
<p>
<dt>In her strange, shadowy coronet she weareth
<dt>The faded jewels of an earlier time;
<dt>An ancient sceptre in her hand she beareth--
<dt>The purple of her robe is past its prime.
<dt>Through her thin silvery locks still dimly shineth
<dt>The flower-wreath woven by pale Memory's fingers.
<dt>Her heart is withered--yet it strangely shineth
<dt>In its lone urn, a light that fitful lingers.
<dt>With her low, muffled voice of mystery,
<dt>She reads old legends from Time's mouldering pages;
<dt>She telleth the Present the recorded history
<dt>And change perpetual of bygone ages:
<dt>Her pilgrim feet still seek the haunted sod
<dt>Once ours, but now by naught but Memory's footsteps trod.
