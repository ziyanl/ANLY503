<p>
<dt>I stole not your garters, dear Margaret, believe me,
<dt>To place them around my neck or my knee:
<dt>They are valueless yet; or they do much deceive me;
<dt>Having never been worn and made sacred by thee.
<p>
<dt>Of Stars and of Garters so much has been said
<dt>That wit's at a stand on a subject so tried:
<dt>On the latter, what has not been sung to the maid
<dt>Ere lovers have hung themselves in them and died!
<p>
<dt>May such tragedy-doings never wait on your love;
<dt>But affection all pure and sublime be your lot;
<dt>So a heaven on earth your existence shall prove,
<dt>Whether fate shall assign you a palace or cot.
<p>
<dt>Then love for love only, ecstatic you'll barter
<dt>And exchange for the ring all the rights of the garter.

<dt>Far from the busy hum of men away,
<dt>Secluded here, naught of the world I see;
<dt>And almost doubt if such a place there be
<dt>As London's trading town, or Paris gay,
<dt>Surcharged with crowds the livelong night and day.
<dt>That war is going on by land and sea,
<dt>That slaughter, tumult, horror and dismay
<dt>Pervade the world, now seemeth strange to me.
<dt>And, as I pass the sweetly lonely hours,
<dt>Estrang&eacute;d here from bustle, strife, and care,
<dt>Surrounded but by woods and fields and flowers,
<dt>While nature's music floats along the air,
<dt>And autumn all her various bounties pours,
<dt>I wish an erring world these scenes with me to share.
