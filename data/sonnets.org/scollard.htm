<p>
<dt>The world is locked in sleep with perfect night.
<dt>Gazing from out my window I behold
<dt>The moon, a burnished bowl of gleaming gold,
<dt>Hung in mid-sky with azure wine brimmed bright.
<dt>The sentinel church-spire lifts its stately height,
<dt>And, where the vane upon its crest is bold,
<dt>A single wanderer from the starry fold
<dt>Shines cold and spectral with its twinkling light.
<p>
<dt>White are the roofs, in crystal garments all;
<dt>Unheard the murmuring streamlet's rhythmic flow--
<dt>Weird shapes upon the spotless waste of snow,
<dt>The tree trunks stand where their gaunt shadows fall.
<dt>Blest hour of rest--gift of a hand Divine!
<dt>What quiet, peace, tranquillity are thine!
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Pomona</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>At noon of night the goddess, silver-stoled,
<dt>Came with light foot across the moonlit land,
<dt>And breezes soft as blow o'er Samarcand
<dt>Stirred her free hair that glinted like clear gold;
<dt>Sweet were her smiling lips, as when of old
<dt>Vertumnus wooed her on the grassy strand
<dt>Of some swift Tuscan river overspanned
<dt>By sunny skies that knew no breath of cold.
<p>
<dt>So when the door of dawn grew aureate,
<dt>And broken was the dim night's peaceful hush
<dt>By harvesters uprisen to greet the morn,
<dt>They knew Pomona had passed by in state,
<dt>For on the apples was a rosier blush,
<dt>And on the grapes a richer lustre born.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Wheat</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Behold a billowy sea of golden spears
<dt>That to and fro in every breeze that blows
<dt>Tosses its amber waves and proudly shows
<dt>Bright scarlet poppies when the warm wind veers.
<dt>Hearken, and lo! there falls upon the ears
<dt>A song as mellow as the one that rose
<dt>From Boaz's fields at daytime's drowsy close
<dt>And thrilled his heart in those dim Hebrew years.
<p>
<dt>And the swart mower, leaning on his scythe
<dt>To catch the swelling music, clear and blythe,
<dt>Thinks, as his eyes with love-light brim and glow,
<dt>That she who sings, the while the bright beams fade,
<dt>Is far diviner than the lovely maid
<dt>Who gleaned in fields Judaean long ago.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>The Fountain</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A Triton, drowsy as the god of Sleep,
<dt>From horn uplifted pours a limpid stream
<dt>Athwart whose falling drops the sunbeams gleam
<dt>Through waving boughs that span the crystal deep.
<dt>From brooding branches bright-eyed nestlings peep,
<dt>The merry sylvan choirs are hushed in dream,
<dt>And all the voices of the mid-day seem
<dt>Within some slumbering warder's wakeless keep.
<p>
<dt>Into a shadowy, moss-rimmed pool like this,
<dt>Musing of dead delight and longed-for bliss,
<dt>The while the murmurous water lapped the shore,
<dt>Alluring nymphs, with smiles and amorous breath,
<dt>Drew the young Hylas down to meet his death
<dt>Amid the silvery reeds that noon of yore.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Statue</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As perfect in their symmetry as thine,
<dt>O inarticulate marble lips, were those
<dt>My love once raised to mine, yet tinged with rose
<dt>And freighted with a redolence divine.
<dt>Her poise of head was queenly; fair and fine
<dt>Her alabaster arms that shamed the snows;
<dt>Her gracious bearing had thy pure repose,
<dt>And stately was she as the forest pine.
<p>
<dt>Knowledge sat throned upon her regal brow,
<dt>Round which her tresses rippled, bright as gold;
<dt>Sweet as a songbird's on a budding bough
<dt>The liquid voice that from her lips outrolled;
<dt>But lo! there came an awful change, and now
<dt>Thou, in thine icy hush, art not more cold!
