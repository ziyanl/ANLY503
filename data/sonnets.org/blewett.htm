<p>
<dt>A little child, she stood that far-off day,
<dt>When Love, the master-painter, took the brush
<dt>And on the wall of mem'ry dull and grey
<dt>Traced tender eyes, wide brow, and changing blush,
<dt>The gladness and the youth, the bending head
<dt>All covered over with its curls of gold,
<dt>The dimpled arms, the two hands filled with bread
<dt>To feed the little sparrows brown and bold
<dt>That flutter to her feet. It hangs there still,
<dt>Just as 'twas painted on that far-off day,
<dt>Nor faded is the blush upon the cheek,
<dt>The sweet lips hold their smiling and can thrill,
<dt>And still the eyes--so tender, and so meek--
<dt>Light up the walls of mem'ry dull and grey.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>At Quebec</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Quebec, the grey old city on the hill,
<dt>Lies with a golden glory on her head,
<dt>Dreaming throughout this hour so fair--so still--
<dt>Of other days and all her mighty dead.
<dt>The white doves perch upon the cannons grim,
<dt>The flowers bloom where once did run a tide
<dt>Of crimson, when the moon rose pale and dim
<dt>Above the battlefield so grim and wide.
<dt>Methinks within her wakes a mighty glow
<dt>Of pride, of tenderness--her stirring past--
<dt>The strife, the valour, of the long ago
<dt>Feels at her heartstrings. Strong, and tall, and vast,
<dt>She lies, touched with the sunset's golden grace,
<dt>A wondrous softness on her grey old face.
