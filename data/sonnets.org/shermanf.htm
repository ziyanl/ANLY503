<p>
<dt>October's peace hath fallen on everything.
<dt>In the far west, above the pine-crowned hill,
<dt>With red and purple yet the heavens thrill--
<dt>The passing of the sun remembering.
<dt>A crow sails by on heavy, flapping wing,
<dt>(In some land, surely the young Spring hath her will!)
<dt>Below, the little city lieth still;
<dt>And on the river's breast the mist-wreaths cling.
<dt>Here, on this slope that yet hath known no plough,
<dt>The cattle wander homeward slowly now;
<dt>In shapeless clumps the ferns are brown and dead.
<dt>Among the fir-trees dusk is swiftly born;
<dt>The maples will be desolate by morn.
<dt>The last word of the summer hath been said.
<p>

<p>
<dt>Though all the light were lifted from the land,
<dt>And a great darkness lay upon the sea;
<dt>Though, groping each for some not-careless hand,
<dt>I felt sad men pass over wearily;
<dt>Though it were certain dawn would not come in
<dt>With the next hour; that after many days
<dt>Would no moon rise where the grey clouds grew thin,
<dt>Nor any stars resume their ancient ways:
<dt>Though all my world was thus, and I more blind
<dt>Than the dead, blundering planets raining past,
<dt>I know I should not fancy Time unkind;
<dt>For you, as once of old you came, at last
<dt>Would surely come, and with unfaltering faith
<dt>Lead me beyond the dominance of death.

<a name=030></a><h2>A Life</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt><i>Let us rise up and live!</i> Behold, each thing
<dt>Is ready for the moulding of our hand.
<dt>Long have they all awaited our command;
<dt>None other will they ever own for king.
<dt>Until we come no bird dare try to sing,
<dt>Nor any sea its power may understand;
<dt>No buds are on the trees; in every land
<dt>Year asketh year some tidings of some Spring.
<dt>Yea, it is time--high time we were awake!
<dt>Simple indeed shall life be unto us.
<dt>What part is ours?--To take what all things give;
<dt>To feel the whole world growing for our sake;
<dt>To have sure knowledge of the marvellous;
<dt>To laugh and love--<i>Let us rise up and live!</i>
<p>

<p>
<dt>I marked the slow withdrawal of the year.
<dt>Out on the hills the scarlet maples shone--
<dt>The glad, first herald of triumphant dawn.
<dt>A robin's song fell through the silence--clear
<dt>As long ago it rang when June was here.
<dt>Then, suddenly, a few grey clouds were drawn
<dt>Across the sky; and all the song was gone,
<dt>And all the gold was quick to disappear.
<dt>That day the sun seemed loth to come again;
<dt>And all day long the low wind spoke of rain,
<dt>Far off, beyond the hills; and moaned, like one
<dt>Wounded, among the pines: as though the Earth,
<dt>Knowing some giant grief had come to birth,
<dt>Had wearied of the Summer and the Sun.
