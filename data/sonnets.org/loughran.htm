<dt>The traveller tells how, in that ancient clime
<dt>Whose mystic monuments and ruins hoar
<dt>Still struggle with the antiquary's lore,
<dt>To guard the secrets of a by-gone time,
<dt>He saw, uprising from the desert bare,
<dt>Like a white ghost, a city of the dead,
<dt>With palaces and temples wondrous fair,
<dt>Where moon-horn'd Isis once was worshipped.
<dt>But silence, like a pall, did all enfold,
<dt>And the inhabitants were turn'd to stone --
<dt>Yea, stone the very heart of every one!
<dt>Once to a rich man I this tale re-told.
<dt>"Stone hearts!  A traveller's myth!" -- he turn'd aside,
<dt>As Hunger begg'd, pale-featured and wild-eyed.
