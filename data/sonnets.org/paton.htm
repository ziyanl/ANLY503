<dt>Could I have sung one Song that should survive
<dt>The singer's voice, and in my country's heart
<dt>Find loving echo--evermore a part
<dt>Of all her sweetest memories; could I give
<dt>One great Thought to the People, that should prove
<dt>The spring of noble action in their hour
<dt>Of darkness, or control their headlong power
<dt>With the firm reins of Justice and of Love;
<dt>Could I have traced one Form that should express
<dt>The sacred mystery that underlies
<dt>All Beauty, and through man's enraptured eyes
<dt>Teach him how beautiful is Holiness,--
<dt>I had not feared thee. But to yield my breath,
<dt>Life's Purpose unfulfilled!--This is thy sting, O Death!
