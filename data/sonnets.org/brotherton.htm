<p>"Is purely a poet of the West; born in Indiana, living in 
Cincinnati, and never having been east of the Blue Ridge.&nbsp; She has 
published two volumes of verse, <em>Beyond the Veil</em> and the <em>Sailing of 
King Olaf</em>         
           
                
         , etc. (Charles H. 
Kerr &amp; Co.)" (<a href="bibliogr.htm#crandall">Crandall</a>)
<h2>    Shakespeare</h2>
<p>
<dt>Working as erst by law, not miracle,
<dt>By genius God doth lift a common soul
<dt>To some still spot where it may glimpse the goal;
<dt>Bidding it on the mountain heights to dwell,
<dt>Yet not so far apart but it may tell
<dt>To toilers in the plain below the whole
<dt>Of the vision.&nbsp; Master, still the organ-roll
<dt>Of thy deep music vibrates, and its spell
<p></p>       
<dt>Aids the uplift that stirs our grosser clay
<dt>To rise and seek the heights.&nbsp; O soul God set
<dt>A little lower than his white angels, yet
<dt>A round for man to climb the starward way
<dt>Thou art.&nbsp; One palm with angels' long since met,
<dt>The other warm in man's grasp still doth stay.
<dt>&nbsp;
