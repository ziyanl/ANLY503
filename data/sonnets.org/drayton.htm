<a name=001></a><h2>"Like an adventurous seafarer am I"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Like an adventurous seafarer am I,
<dt>Who hath some long and dang'rous voyage been,
<dt>And called to tell of his discovery,
<dt>How far he sailed, what countries he had seen;
<dt>Proceeding from the port whence he put forth,
<dt>Shows by his compass how his course he steered,
<dt>When east, when west, when south, and when by north,
<dt>As how the pole to ev'ry place was reared,
<dt>What capes he doubled, of what continent,
<dt>The gulfs and straits that strangely he had passed,
<dt>Where most becalmed, where with foul weather spent,
<dt>And on what rocks in peril to be cast:
<dt>Thus in my love, time calls me to relate
<dt>My tedious travels and oft-varying fate.
</p>
<p>
<p>
<a name=009></a><h2>"As other men, so I myself do muse"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>As other men, so I myself do muse
<dt>Why in this sort I wrest invention so,
<dt>And why these giddy metaphors I use,
<dt>Leaving the path the greater part do go.
<dt>I will resolve you: I am lunatic,
<dt>And ever this in madmen you shall find
<dt>What they last thought of, when the brain grew sick,
<dt>In most distraction they keep that in mind.
<dt>Thus talking idly in this bedlam fit,
<dt>Reason and I, you must conceive, are twain;
<dt>'Tis nine years now since first I lost my wit,
<dt>Bear with me, then, though troubled be my brain.
<dt>With diet and correction, men distraught
<dt>(Not too far past) may to their wits be brought.
</p>
<p>
<p>
<a name=010></a><h2>"To nothing fitter can I thee compare"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>To nothing fitter can I thee compare
<dt>Than to the son of some rich penny-father,
<dt>Who having now brought on his end with care,
<dt>Leaves to his son all he had heaped together;
<dt>This new-rich novice, lavish of his chest,
<dt>To one man gives, doth on another spend,
<dt>Then here he riots; yet amongst the rest
<dt>Haps to lend some to one true honest friend.
<dt>Thy gifts thou in obscurity dost waste,
<dt>False friends thy kindness, born but to deceive thee;
<dt>Thy love, that is on the unworthy placed;
<dt>Time hath thy beauty, which with age will leave thee;
<dt>Only that little which to me was lent,
<dt>I give thee back, when all the rest is spent.
</p>

<a name=021></a><h2>"A witless gallant, a young wench that wooed"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A witless gallant, a young wench that wooed
<dt>(Yet his dull spirit her not one jot could move),
<dt>Entreated me, as e'er I wished his good
<dt>To write him but one sonnet to his love;
<dt>When I, as fast as e'er my pen could trot,
<dt>Poured out what first from quick invention came,
<dt>Nor never stood one word thereof to blot,
<dt>Much like his wit, that was to use the same;
<dt>But with my verses he his mistress won,
<dt>Who doted on the dolt beyond all measure.
<dt>But see, for you to heav'n for phrase I run,
<dt>And ransack all Apollo's golden treasure;
<dt>Yet by my froth this fool his love obtains,
<dt>And I lose you for all my wit and pains.

<a name=031></a><h2>"Methinks I see some crooked mimic jeer"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Methinks I see some crooked mimic jeer,
<dt>And tax my muse with this fantastic grace;
<dt>Turning my papers, asks, What have we here?
<dt>Making withal some filthy antic face.
<dt>I fear no censure, nor what thou canst say,
<dt>Nor shall my spirit one jot of vigor lose
<dt>Think'st thou my wit shall keep the pack-horse way
<dt>That ev'ry dudgeon low invention goes?
<dt>Since sonnets thus in bundles are impressed,
<dt>And ev'ry drudge doth dull our satiate ear,
<dt>Think'st thou my love shall in those rags be dressed
<dt>That ev'ry dowdy, ev'ry trull doth wear?
<dt>Up to my pitch no common judgment flies,
<dt>I scorn all earthly dung-bred <a href="#999">scarabies</a>.
</P>
<p>
<a name=032></a><h2>"Our floods' queen, Thames, for ships and swans is crowned"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Our floods' queen, Thames, for ships and swans is crowned,
<dt>And stately Severn for her shore is praised;
<dt>The crystal Trent for fords and fish renowned,
<dt>And Avon's fame to Albion's cliffs is raised;
<dt>Carlegion Chester vaunts her holy Dee;
<dt>York many wonders of her Ouse can tell,
<dt>The Peak her Dove, whose banks so fertile be,
<dt>And Kent will say her Medway doth excel;
<dt>Cotswold commends her Isis to the Tame;
<dt>Our northern borders boast of Tweed's fair flood;
<dt>Our western parts extol their Wylye's fame,
<dt>And the old Lea brags of the Danish blood;
<dt>Arden's sweet Anker, let thy glory be
<dt>That fair Idea only lives by thee.
</p>
<p>
<a name=033></a><h2>"Some misbelieving and profane in love"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Some misbelieving and profane in love,
<dt>When I do speak of miracles by thee,
<dt>May say that thou art flattered by me
<dt>Who only write my skill in verse to prove;
<dt>See miracles, ye unbelieving, see
<dt>A dumb-born muse made to express the mind,
<dt>A cripple hand to write, yet lame by kind,
<dt>One by thy name, the other touching thee;
<dt>Blind were mine eyes till they were seen of thine,
<dt>And mine ears deaf by thy fame healed be,
<dt>My vices cured by virtues sprung from thee,
<dt>My hopes revived, which long in grave had lyne;
<dt>All unclean thoughts foul spirits cast out in me
<dt>Only by virtue that proceeds from thee.
</p>
<p>
<a name=037></a><h2>Dear, why should you command me to my rest,</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Dear, why should you command me to my rest,
<dt>When now the night doth summon all to sleep?
<dt>Methinks this time becometh lovers best:
<dt>Night was ordained together friends to keep.
<dt>How happy are all other living things,
<dt>Which though the day disjoin by several flight,
<dt>The quiet Evening yet together brings,
<dt>And each returns unto his love at night!
<dt>O thou that art so courteous unto all,
<dt>Why shouldst thou, Night, abuse me only thus,
<dt>That every creature to his kind dost call,
<dt>And yet 'tis thou dost only sever us?
<dt>Well could I wish it would be ever day,
<dt>If, when night comes, you bid me go away.
</P>
<p>
<a name=038></a><h2>"Some men there be which like my method well"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Some men there be which like my method well,
<dt>And much commend the strangeness of my vein;
<dt>Some say I have a passing pleasing strain,
<dt>Some say that in my humor I excel;
<dt>Some, who not kindly relish my conceit,
<dt>They say, as poets do, I use to feign,
<dt>And in bare words paint out my passion's pain.
<dt>Thus sundry men their sundry minds repeat.
<dt>I pass not, I, how men affected be,
<dt>Nor who commends or discommends my verse;
<dt>It pleaseth me if I my woes rehearse,
<dt>And in my lines if she my love may see.
<dt>Only my comfort still consists in this,
<dt>Writing her praise I cannot write amiss.
</p>
<a name=044></a><h2>"Whilst thus my pen strives to eternize thee"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Whilst thus my pen strives to eternize thee,
<dt>Age rules my lines with wrinkles in my face,
<dt>Where, in the map of all my misery,
<dt>Is modeled out the world of my disgrace;
<dt>Whilst in despite of tyrannizing times,
<dt>Medea-like I make thee young again.
<dt>Proudly thou scorn'st my world-outwearing rhymes,
<dt>And murther'st virtue with thy coy disdain;
<dt>And though in youth my youth untimely perish
<dt>To keep thee from oblivion and the grave,
<dt>Ensuing ages yet my rhymes shall cherish,
<dt>Where I, entombed, my better part shall save;
<dt>And though this earthly body fade and die,
<dt>My name shall mount upon eternity.
</P>
<p>
<a name=045></a><h2>"In pride of wit, when high desire of fame"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>In pride of wit, when high desire of fame
<dt>Gave life and courage to my lab'ring pen,
<dt>And first the sound and virtue of my name
<dt>Won grace and credit in the ears of men;
<dt>With those the thronged theaters that press
<dt>I in the circuit for the laurel strove,
<dt>Where the full praise, I freely must confess,
<dt>In heat of blood, a modest mind might move.
<dt>With shouts and claps at ev'ry little pause,
<dt>When the proud round on ev'ry side hath rung,
<dt>Sadly I sit, unmoved with the applause,
<dt>As though to me it nothing did belong.
<dt>No public glory vainly I pursue,
<dt>All that I seek is to eternize you.
</p>
<a name=061></a><h2>"Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<P>
<dt>Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part,
<dt>Nay I have done, you get no more of me;
<dt>And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart,
<dt>That thus so cleanly I myself can free;
<dt>Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows,
<dt>And when we meet at any time again,
<dt>Be it not seen in either of our brows
<dt>That we one lot of former love retain.
<dt>Now at the last gasp of love's latest breath,
<dt>When his pulse failing, passion speechless lies,
<dt>When faith is kneeling by his bed of death,
<dt>And innocence is closing up his eyes,
<dt>-Now if thou would'st, when all have given him over,
<dt>From death to life thou might'st him yet recover!
</P>
<p>
<a name=062></a><h2>"Truce, gentle love, a parley now I crave"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Truce, gentle love, a parley now I crave;
<dt>Methinks 'tis long since first these wars begun,
<dt>Nor thou, nor I, the better yet can have,
<dt>Bad is the match where neither party won.
<dt>I offer free conditions of fair peace,
<dt>My heart for hostage that it shall remain;
<dt>Discharge our forces, here let malice cease,
<dt>So for my pledge thou give me pledge again;
<dt>Or if no thing but death will serve thy turn,
<dt>Still thirsting for subversion of my state,
<dt>Do what thou canst, raze, massacre, and burn,
<dt>Let the world see the utmost of thy hate;
<dt>I send defiance, since if overthrown,
<dt>Thou vanquishing, the conquest is mine own.
