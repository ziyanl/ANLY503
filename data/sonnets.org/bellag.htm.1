<h2>   A Sonnet</h2>
<p>
<dt>Time, speeding, rules: all things compelled obey.
<dt>Oh! May this king ne'er turn your love from me!
<p></p>
<p>     </p><dt>May every year's forced March, a blessing be,
<dt>Your love recruiting, driving fears away.
<p></p>
<p> 
    </p><dt>Dear Guide! Nought can thy tender care repay:
<dt>Each seeming harsh reproof 
was, now I see,
<dt>An act of love: received—ungratefully,
<dt>Recalling conscience forces me to say.
<p></p>
<p>     </p><dt>Feel not, amid the greetings of this morn,
<dt>A Blank, because from sight my 
form has gone:
<dt>Though I be absent, yet my heart's at home,
<dt>Hailing thy 
Birthday, while my voice is dumb:
<dt>Each absence makes me prize my home the 
more:
<dt>Return shall find me—worthier than before.
<p></p>         
<dt>
