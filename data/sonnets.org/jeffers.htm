<a name=010></a><h2>And the Stars</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Perhaps you did not know how bright last night,
<dt>Especially above your seaside door,
<dt>Was all the marvelous starlit sky, and wore
<dt>White harmonies of very shining light.
<dt>Perhaps you did not want to seek the sight
<dt>Of that remembered rapture any more.--
<dt>But then at least you must have heard the shore
<dt>Roar with reverberant voices thro' the night.
<p>
<dt>Those stars were lit with longing of my own,
<dt>And the ocean's moan was full of my own pain.
<dt>Yet doubtless it was well for both of us
<dt>You did not come, but left me there alone.
<dt>I hardly ought to see you much again;
<dt>And stars, we know, are often dangerous.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Wonder and Joy</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The things that one grows tired of--O, be sure
<dt>They are only foolish artificial things!
<dt>Can a bird ever tire of having wings?
<dt>And I, so long as life and sense endure,
<dt>(Or brief be they!) shall nevermore inure
<dt>My heart to the recurrence of the springs,
<dt>Of the gray dawns, the gracious evenings,
<dt>The infinite wheeling stars. A wonder pure
<dt>Must ever well within me to behold
<dt>Venus decline; or great Orion, whose belt
<dt>Is studded with three nails of burning gold,
<dt>Ascend the winter heaven.  Who never felt
<dt>This wondering joy may yet be good or great:
<dt>But envy him not: he is not fortunate.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Eucalyptus Trees</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thankful, my country, be to him who first
<dt>Brought hither from Australia oversea
<dt>Sapling or seed of the undeciduous tree
<dt>Whose grave and sombre foliage fears no burst
<dt>Of heat from summer-naked heavens, nor thirst
<dt>Though all the winter is rainless, and the bee
<dt>Starves, finding not a blossom. Patiently
<dt>The great roots delve, and feel though deep-immersed
<dt>Some layer of ancient moisture, and the leaves
<dt>Perish not, hanging pointed in the sky.
<dt>To see these lofty trunks gray-barked and broad
<dt>Wall with clear shade a long white southern road
<dt>I have been as one devoted, who receives
<dt>An impulse or a promise from on high.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>The First Grass</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>It rained three autumn days, then close to frost
<dt>Under clear starlight the night shivering was.
<dt>The dawn rose cold and colorless as glass,
<dt>And when we wakened rains and clouds were lost.
<dt>The ocean surged and shouted stormy-tossed.
<dt>I went down to companion him. Alas,
<dt>What faint voice by the way? The sudden grass
<dt>Cried with thin lips as I the valley crossed,
<dt>Saying blade by blade, "Although the warm sweet rain
<dt>Awakened us, this world is all too cold.
<dt>We never dreamed it thus."--"Your champion bold
<dt>Is risen," I said; "he in an hour or twain
<dt>Will comfort you." I passed. Above the dune
<dt>Stood the wan splendorless daylight-waning moon.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>When I Behold the Greatest</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>When I behold the greatest and most wise
<dt>Fall out of heaven, wings not by pride struck numb
<dt>Like Satan's, but to gain some humbler crumb
<dt>Of pittance from penurious granaries;
<dt>And when I see under each new disguise
<dt>The same cowardice of custom, the same dumb
<dt>Devil that drove our Wordswroth to become
<dt>Apologist of kings and priests and lies;
<dt>And how a man may find in all he loathes
<dt>Contentment after all, and so endear it
<dt>By cowardly craft it grows his inmost own;--
<dt>Then I renew my faith with firmer oaths,
<dt>And bind with more tremendous vows a spirit
<dt>That, often fallen, never has lain prone.
