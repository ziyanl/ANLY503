<p>"This very unequal but at his best truly noteworthy poet was a Canadian, and distinctly the most original writer in verse whom the Dominion has produced.  His sonnets (generally irregular and sometimes consisting merely of seven rhymed couplets) are mainly comprised in the volume called <i>Jephthah's Daughter</i>. Heavysege is best known, both in Canada and Great Britain, by his tragedy <i>Saul</i>." (<a href="bibliogr.htm#sharp">Sharp</a>)

<a name=010></a><h2>Night</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>'Tis solemn darkness; the sublime of shade;
<dt>Night, by no stars nor rising moon relieved;
<dt>The awful blank of nothingness arrayed,
<dt>O'er which my eye-balls roll in vain, deceived.
<dt>Upward, around, and downward I explore,
<dt>E'en to the frontiers of the ebon air,
<dt>But cannot, though I strive, discover more
<dt>Than what seems one huge cavern of despair.
<dt>Oh, Night, art thou so grim, when, black and bare
<dt>Of moonbeams, and no cloudlets to adorn,
<dt>Like a nude Ethiop 'twixt two houris fair,
<dt>Thou stand'st between the evening and the morn?
<dt>I took thee for an angel, but have wooed
<dt>A cacodaemon in mine ignorant mood.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>The Dead</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How great unto the living seem the dead!
<dt>How sacred, solemn; how heroic grown;
<dt>How vast and vague, as they obscurely tread
<dt>The shadowy confines of the dim unknown!--
<dt>For they have met the monster that we dread,
<dt>Have learned the secret not to mortal shown.
<dt>E'en as gigantic shadows on the wall
<dt>The spirit of the daunted child amaze,
<dt>So on us thoughts of the departed fall,
<dt>And with phantasma fill our gloomy gaze.
<dt>Awe and deep wonder lend the living lines,
<dt>And hope and ecstasy the borrowed beams;
<dt>While fitful fancy the full form divines,
<dt>And all is what imagination dreams.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Beyond the Sunset</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Hushed in a calm beyond mine utterance,
<dt>See in the western sky the evening spread;
<dt>Suspended in its pale, serene expanse,
<dt>Like scattered flames, the glowing cloudlets red.
<dt>Clear are those clouds, and that pure sky's profound,
<dt>Transparent as a lake of hyaline;
<dt>Nor motion, nor the faintest breath of sound,
<dt>Disturbs the steadfast beauty of the scene.
<dt>Far o'er the vault the winnowed welkin wide,
<dt>From the bronzed east unto the whitened west,
<dt>Moored, seem, in their sweet, tranquil, roseate pride,
<dt>Those clouds the fabled islands of the blest;--
<dt>The lands where pious spirits breathe in joy,
<dt>And love and worship all their hoiurs employ.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Winter Skies</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The stars are glittering in the frosty sky,
<dt>Numerous as pebbles on a broad sea-coast;
<dt>And o'er the vault the cloud-like galaxy
<dt>Has marshalled its innumerable host.
<dt>Alive all heaven seems! with wondrous glow
<dt>Tenfold refulgent every star appears,
<dt>As if some wide, celestial gale did blow,
<dt>And thrice illume the ever-kindled spheres.
<dt>Orbs, with glad orbs rejoicing, burning, beam
<dt>Ray-crowned, with lambent lustre in their zones,
<dt>Till o'er the blue, bespangled spaces seem
<dt>Angels and great archangels on their thrones;
<dt>A host divine, whose eyes are sparkling gems,
<dt>And forms more bright than diamond diadems.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Coming of Morn</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>See how the Morn awakes. Along the sky
<dt>Proceeds she with her pale, increasing light,
<dt>And, from the depths of the dim canopy,
<dt>Drives out the shadows of departing night.
<dt>Lo, the clouds break, and gradually more wide
<dt>Morn openeth her bright, rejoicing gates;
<dt>And ever, as the orient valves divide,
<dt>A costlier aspect on their breadth awaits.
<p>
<dt>Lo, the clouds break, and in each opened schism
<dt>The coming Phoebus lays huge beams of gold,
<dt>And roseate fire and glories that the prism
<dt>Would vainly strive before us to unfold;
<dt>And, while I gaze, from out the bright abysm
<dt>A flaming disc is to the horizon rolled.
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>The Stream</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>'Twas Sabbath morn. I lay 'neath pensive spell,
<dt>And saw, in reverie or waking dream,
<dt>My life elapse, in likeness of a stream
<dt>That in a slant and steady torrent fell,
<dt>As if it gushed beneath the force supreme
<dt>Of some high reservoir or lofty well.
<dt>E'en such a stream I saw as, from a bank
<dt>Verdant with mosses and perpetual dank,
<dt>I have observed leap forth when heavy rains
<dt>Have, through the uplands filtered, fed earth's veins
<dt>To bursting. This I saw with troubled eye,
<dt>Anticipating when the stream no more
<dt>In ceaseless, crystalline cascade should pour,
<dt>But sudden stop, or slowly dribble dry.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>The Mystery of Doom</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>'Twas on a day, and in high, radiant heaven,
<dt>An angel lay beside a lake reclined,
<dt>Against whose shores the rolling waves were driven,
<dt>And beat the measure to the dancing wind.
<dt>There, rapt, he meditated on that story
<dt>Of how Jehovah did of yore expel
<dt>Heaven's aborigines from grace and glory,--
<dt>Those mighty angels that did dare rebel.
<dt>And, as he mused upon their dread abode
<dt>And endless penance, from his drooping hands
<dt>His harp sank down, and scattered all abroad
<dt>Its rosy garland on the golden sands;
<dt>His soul mute wondering that the All-wise Spirit
<dt>Should have allowed the doom of such demerit.
