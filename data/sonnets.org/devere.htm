<a name=001></a><h2>Incompatibility</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Forgive me that I love you as I do,
<dt>Friend patient long; too patient to reprove
<dt>The inconvenience of superfluous love.
<dt>You feel that it molests you, and 'tis true.
<dt>In a light bark you sit, with a full crew.
<dt>Your life full orbed, compelled strange love to meet,
<dt>Becomes, by such addition, incomplete:--
<dt>Because I love I leave you.  O adieu!
<dt>Perhaps when I am gone the thought of me
<dt>May sometimes be your acceptable guest.
<dt>Indeed you love me: but my company
<dt>Old time makes tedious; and to part is best.
<dt>Not without Nature's will are natures wed:-
<dt>O gentle Death, how dear thou makest the dead!
</p>
<p>
<a name=002></a><h2>Troilus and Cressida</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Had I been worthy of the love you gave,
<dt>That love withdrawn had left me sad but strong;
<dt>My heart had been as silent as my tongue,
<dt>My bed had been unfevered as my grave;
<dt>I had not striven for what I could not save;
<dt>Back, back to heaven my great hopes I had flung;
<dt>To have much suffered, having done no wrong,
<dt>Had seemed to me that noble part the brave
<dt>Account it ever. What this hour I am
<dt>Affirms the unworthiness that in me lurked:
<dt>Some sapping poison through my substance worked,
<dt>Some sin not trivial, though it lacked a name,
<dt>Which ratifies the deed that you have done
<dt>With plain approval. Other plea seek none.
</p>
<p>
<a name=003></a><h2>Flowers I Would Bring</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Flowers I would bring if flowers could make thee fairer,
<dt>And music if the Muse were dear to thee,
<dt>(For loving these would make thee love the bearer);
<dt>But sweetest songs forget their melody,
<dt>And loveliest flowers would but conceal the wearer:
<dt>A rose I marked, and might have plucked; but she
<dt>Blushed as she bent, imploring me to spare her,
<dt>Nor spoil her beauty by such rivalry.
<dt>Alas! and with what gifts shall I pursue thee,
<dt>What offerings bring, what treasures lay before thee,
<dt>When earth with all her floral train doth woo thee,
<dt>And all old poets and old songs adore thee,
<dt>And love to thee is naught; from passionate mood
<dt>Secured by joy's complacent plenitude.
</p>
<p>
<a name=004></a><h2>The Mighty Mountain Plains</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The mighty mountain plains have we two trod
<dt>Both in the glow of sunset and sunrise;
<dt>And lighted by the moon of southern skies
<dt>The snow-white torrent of the thundering flood
<dt>We two have watched together: In the wood
<dt>We two have felt the warm tears dim our eyes
<dt>While zephyrs softer than an infant's sighs
<dt>Ruffled the light air of our solitude.
<dt>O Earth, maternal Earth, and thou O Heaven,
<dt>And Night first born, who now, e'en now, dost waken
<dt>The host of stars, thy constellated train,
<dt>Tell me if those can ever be forgiven,
<dt>Those abject, who together have partaken
<dt>These Sacraments of Nature--and in vain?
</p>
<p>
<a name=005></a><h2>The Sun God</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I saw the Master of the Sun. He stood
<dt>High in his luminous car, himself more bright;
<dt>An Archer of immeasurable might
<dt>On his left shoulder hung his quivered load
<dt>Spurned by his Steeds the eastern mountain glowed
<dt>Forward his eager eye, and brow of light
<dt>He bent; and, while both hands that arch embowed,
<dt>Shaft after shaft pursued the flying Night.
<dt>No wings profaned that godlike form: around
<dt>His neck high held an ever-moving crowd
<dt>Of locks hung glistening: while such perfect sound
<dt>Fell from his bowstring, that th'ethereal dome
<dt>Thrilled as a dewdrop; and each passing cloud
<dt>Expanded, whitening like the ocean foam.
</p>
<p>
<a name=006></a><h2>Sorrow</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Count each affliction, whether light or grave,
<dt>God's messenger sent down to thee; do thou
<dt>With courtesy receive him; rise and bow
<dt>And ere his shadow pass thy threshold, crave
<dt>Permission first his heavenly feet to lave
<dt>Then lay before him all thou hast : Allow
<dt>No cloud of passion to usurp thy brow,
<dt>Or mar thy hospitality; no wave
<dt>Of mortal tumult to obliterate
<dt>The soul's marmoreal calmness: Grief should be,
<dt>Like joy, majestic, equable, sedate;
<dt>Confirming, cleansing, raising, making free;
<dt>Strong to consume small troubles; to commend
<dt>Great thoughts, grave thoughts, thoughts lasting to the end.
