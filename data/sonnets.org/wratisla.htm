<p>
<dt>I love you for the grief that lurks within
<dt>Your languid spirit, and because you wear
<dt>Corruption with a vague and childish air,
<dt>And with your beauty know the depths of sin;
<p>
<dt>Because shame cuts and holds you like a gin,
<dt>And virtue dies in you slain by despair,
<dt>Since evil has you tangled in its snare
<dt>And triumphs on the soul good cannot win.
<p>
<dt>I love you since you know remorse and tears,
<dt>And in your troubled loveliness appears
<dt>The spot of ancient crimes that writhe and hiss:
<p>
<dt>I love you for your hands that calm and bless,
<dt>The perfume of your sad and slow caress,
<dt>The avid poison of your subtle kiss.
<p>
<a name=020></a><H2>White Lilies</H2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Flowers rare and sweet I sent, whose delicate white
<dt>Should, grouping at her corsage, interlace
<dt>Their purity with her corrupted grace,
<dt>With the full throat and mouth of my delight.
<p>
<dt>Evil design! To see the pale flowers slight
<dt>The beauty of the worn and powdered face,
<dt>Mingling their costly virtue with the trace
<dt>Of ancient loves that live in time's despite.
<p>
<dt>How soon they died, poor blossoms! at her throat
<dt>Ere of the last valse died the last sad note
<dt>No more than love of her meant to endure,
<p>
<dt>For all the savour of her lips, the spice
<dt>Of her frail spirit steeped in cultured vice,
<dt>Gracefully bad and delicately impure!
<p>
<a name=030></a><H2>Hothouse Flowers</H2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I hate the flower of wood or common field.
<dt>I cannot love the primrose nor regret
<dt>The death of any shrinking violet,
<dt>Nor even the cultured garden's banal yield.
<p>
<dt>The silver lips of lilies virginal,
<dt>The full deep bosom of the enchanted rose
<dt>Please less than flowers glass-hid from frost and snows
<dt>For whom an alien heat makes festival.
<p>
<dt>I love those flowers reared by man's careful art,
<dt>Of heady scents and colors: strong of heart
<dt>Or weak that die beneath the touch of knife,
<p>
<dt>Some rich as sin and some as virtue pale,
<dt>And some as subtly infamous and frail
<dt>As she whose love still eats my soul and life.
