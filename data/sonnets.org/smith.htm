<a name=010></a><h2>Written near a Port on a Dark Evening</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Huge vapours brood above the clifted shore,
<dt>Night on the ocean settles dark and mute,
<dt>Save where is heard the repercussive roar
<dt>Of drowsy billows on the rugged foot
<dt>Of rocks remote; or still more distant tone
<dt>Of seamen in the anchored bark that tell
<dt>The watch relieved; or one deep voice alone
<dt>Singing the hour, and bidding "Strike the bell!"
<p>
<dt>All is black shadow but the lucid line
<dt>Marked by the light surf on the level sand,
<dt>Or where afar the ship-lights faintly shine
<dt>Like wandering fairy fires, that oft on land
<dt>Misled the pilgrim--such the dubious ray
<dt>That wavering reason lends in life's long darkling way.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Retirement</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>He may be envied who with tranquil breast
<dt>Can wander in the wild and woodland scene,
<dt>When summer's glowing hands have newly dressed
<dt>The shadowy forests and the copses green;
<dt>Who unpursued by care can pass his hours
<dt>Where briony and woodbine fringe the trees,
<dt>On thymy banks reposing, while the bees
<dt>Murmur "their fairy tunes in praise of flowers";
<dt>Or on the rock with ivy clad and fern
<dt>That overhangs the osier-whispering bed
<dt>Of some clear current, bids his wishes turn
<dt>From this bad world; and by calm reason led,
<dt>Knows in refined retirement to possess,
<dt>My friendship hallowed, rural happiness!
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>To the Goddess of Botany</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Of folly weary, shrinking from the view
<dt>Of violence and fraud, allowed to take
<dt>All peace from humble life, I would forsake
<dt>Their haunts for ever, and, sweet nymph! with you
<dt>Find shelter; where my tired and tear-swoln eyes,
<dt>Among your silent shades of soothing hue,
<dt>Your "bells and florets of unnumbered dyes"
<dt>Might rest--and learn the bright varieties
<dt>That from your lovely hands are fed with dew;
<dt>And every vein&eacute;d leaf that trembling sighs
<dt>In mead or woodland; or in wilds remote;
<dt>Or lurk with mosses in the humid caves,
<dt>Mantle the cliffs, on dimpling rivers float,
<dt>Or stream from coral rocks beneath the ocean waves.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>The Sea View</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The upland shepherd, as reclined he lies
<dt>On the soft turf that clothes the mountain brow,
<dt>Marks the bright sea-line mingling with the skies;
<dt>Or from his course celestial sinking low
<dt>The summer sun in purple radiance glow
<dt>Blaze on the western waters; the wide scene
<dt>Magnificent and tranquil seems to spread
<dt>Even over the rustic's breast a joy serene,
<dt>When, like dark plague-spots by the demons shed,
<dt>Charged deep with death, upon the waves far seen
<dt>Move the war-freighted ships; and fierce and red
<dt>Flash their destructive fires--The mangled dead
<dt>And dying victims then pollute the flood.
<dt>Ah! thus man spoils glorious works with blood!
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Gossamer</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Over faded heath-flowers spun, or thorny furze,
<dt>The filmy gossamer is lightly spread;
<dt>Waving in every sighing air that stirs,
<dt>As fairy fingers had entwined the thread:
<dt>A thousand trembling orbs of lucid dew
<dt>Spangle the texture of the fairy loom,
<dt>As if soft sylphs, lamenting as they flew,
<dt>Had wept departed summer's transient bloom:
<dt>But the wind rises, and the turf receives
<dt>The glittering web:--So, evanescent, fade
<dt>Bright views that youth with sanguine heart believes:
<dt>So vanish schemes of bliss, by fancy made;
<dt>Which, fragile as the fleeting dews of morn,
<dt>Leave but the withered heath, and barren thorn!
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>Care</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Should the lone wanderer, fainting on his way,
<dt>Rest for a moment of the sultry hours
<dt>And though his path through thorns and roughness lay,
<dt>Pluck the wild rose or woodbine's gadding flowers;
<dt>Weaving gay wreaths beneath some sheltering tree,
<dt>The sense of sorrow he awhile may lose;
<dt>So have l sought thy flowers, fair poesy
<dt>So charmed my way with friendship and the muse.
<p>
<dt>But darker now grows life's unhappy day,
<dt>Dark with new clouds of evil yet to come:
<dt>Her pencil sickening fancy throws away
<dt>And weary hope reclines upon the tomb;
<dt>And points my wishes to that tranquil shore
<dt>Where the pale spectre care pursues no more.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>To the Moon</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Queen of the silver bow!--by thy pale beam
<dt>Alone and pensive, I delight to stray,
<dt>And watch thy shadow trembling in the stream,
<dt>Or mark the floating clouds that cross thy way.
<dt>And while I gaze, thy mild and placid light
<dt>Sheds a soft calm upon my troubled breast;
<dt>And oft I think--fair planet of the night--
<dt>That in thy orb, the wretched may have rest:
<dt>The sufferers of the earth perhaps may go,
<dt>Released by Death--to thy benignant sphere,
<dt>And the sad children of Despair and Woe
<dt>Forget, in thee, their cup of sorrow here.
<dt>Oh! that I soon may reach thy world serene,
<dt>Poor wearied pilgrim--in this toiling scene!
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>To Sleep</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Come balmy Sleep! tired Nature's soft resort!
<dt>On these sad temples all thy poppies shed;
<dt>And bid gay dreams from Morpheus' airy court,
<dt>Float in light vision round my aching head!
<dt>Secure of all thy blessings, partial Power!
<dt>On his hard bed the peasant throws him down;
<dt>And the poor sea boy, in the rudest hour,
<dt>Enjoys thee more than he who wears a crown.
<dt>Clasped in her faithful shepherd's guardian arms,
<dt>Well may the village girl sweet slumbers prove,
<dt>And they, O gentle Sleep! still taste thy charms,
<dt>Who wake to labor, liberty and love.
<dt>But still thy opiate aid dost thou deny
<dt>To calm the anxious breast; to close the streaming eye.
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>In a Churchyard</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>O thou, who sleep'st where hazel bands entwine
<dt>The vernal grass, with paler violets drest!
<dt>I would, sweet maid, thy humble bed were mine,
<dt>And mine thy calm and enviable rest.
<dt>For never more, by human ills opprest,
<dt>Shall thy soft spirit fruitlessly repine:
<dt>Thou canst not now thy fondest hopes resign
<dt>Even in the hour that should have made thee blest.
<dt>Light lies the turf upon thy virgin breast;
<dt>And lingering here, to love and sorrow true,
<dt>The youth who once thy simple heart possest
<dt>Shall mingle tears with April's early dew;
<dt>While still for him shall faithful memory save
<dt>Thy form and virtues from the silent grave.
