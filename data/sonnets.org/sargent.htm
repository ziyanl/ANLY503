<h2>A Calm</h2>
<p>
<dt>Oh for one draught of cooling northern air!
<dt>That it might pour its freshness on me now;
<dt>That it might kiss my cheek and cleave my hair,
<dt>And part its currents round my fevered brow!
<dt>Ocean, and sky, and earth! a blistering calm
<dt>Spread over all! how weary wears the day!
<dt>Oh lift the wave, and bend the distant palm,
<dt>Breeze! wheresoe'er thy lagging pinions stray,--
<dt>Triumphant burst upon the level deep,
<dt>Rock the fixed hull, and swell the clinging sail!
<dt>Arouse the opal clouds that o'er us sleep,
<dt>Sound thy shrill whistle! we will bid thee hail!
<dt>Though wrapped in all the storm-clouds of the north,
<dt>Yet from thy home of ice, come forth, O breeze, come forth!
