  "Mistress, behold, in this true-speaking glass"
</H2>
<P>
<dt>
Mistress, behold, in this true-speaking glass
<dt>
Thy beauty's graces, of all women rarest,
<dt>
Where thou mayst find how largely they surpass
<dt>
And stain in glorious loveliness the fairest.
<dt>
But read, sweet mistress, and behold it nearer,
<dt>
Pond'ring my sorrow's outrage with some pity;
<dt>
Then shalt thou find no worldly creature dearer
<dt>
Than thou to me, thyself in each love ditty.
<dt>
But in this mirror equally compare
<dt>
Thy matchless beauty with mine endless grief;
<dt>
There like thyself none can be found so fair,
<dt>
Of chiefest pains there, are my pains the chief.
<dt>
Betwixt these both, this one doubt shalt thou find:
<dt>
Whether are here extremest in their kind.

  "Ah, sweet Content, where is thy mild abode?"
</H2>
<p>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Ah, sweet Content, where is thy mild abode?
<dt>
Is it with shepherds and light-hearted swains?
<dt>
Which sing upon the downs and pipe abroad,
<dt>
Tending their flocks and cattle on the plains?
<dt>
Ah, sweet Content, where dost thou safely rest?
<dt>
In heaven, with angels which the praises sing
<dt>
Of him that made and rules at his behest
<dt>
The minds and hearts of every living thing?
<dt>
Ah, sweet Content, where doth thine harbour hold?
<dt>
Is it in churches, with religious men
<dt>
Which please the gods with prayers manifold,
<dt>
And in their studies meditate it then?-
<dt>
Whether thou dost in heaven or earth appear,
<dt>
Be where thou wilt, thou wilt not harbour here.

  "Burn on, sweet fire, for I live by that fuel"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Burn on, sweet fire, for I live by that fuel
<dt>
Whose smoke is as an incense to my soul.
<dt>
Each sigh prolongs my smart. Be fierce and cruel,
<dt>
My fair Parthenophe. Frown and control,
<dt>
Vex, torture, scald, disgrace me. Do thy will!
<dt>
Stop up thine ears; with flint immure thine heart,
<dt>
And kill me with thy looks, if they would kill.
<dt>
Thine eyes, those crystal phials which impart
<dt>
The perfect balm to my dead-wounded breast,
<dt>
Thine eyes, the quivers whence those darts were drawn
<dt>
Which me to thy love's bondage have addressed;
<dt>
Thy smile and frown, night-star and daylight's dawn,
<dt>
Burn on, frown on, vex, stop thine ears, torment me!
<dt>
More, for thy beauty borne, would not repent me.

  "This careful head, with divers thoughts distressed"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
This careful head, with divers thoughts distressed,
<dt>
My fancy's chronicler, my sorrow's muse;
<dt>
These watchful eyes, whose heedless aim I curse,
<dt>
Love's sentinels, and fountains of unrest;
<dt>
This tongue still trembling, herald fit addressed
<dt>
To my love's grief (than any torment worse);
<dt>
This heart, true fortress of my spotless love,
<dt>
And rageous furnace of my long desire:
<dt>
Of these, by nature, am I not possessed,
<dt>
Though nature their first means in me did move.
<dt>
But thou, dear sweet, with thy love's holy fire,
<dt>
My head grief's anvil made, with cares oppressed;
<dt>
Mine eyes, a spring; my tongue, a leaf, wind-shaken;
<dt>
My heart, a wasteful wilderness forsaken.

  "No more lewd lays of lighter loves I sing"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
No more lewd lays of lighter loves I sing,
<dt>
Nor teach my lustful muse abused to fly
<dt>
With sparrows' plumes, and for compassion cry
<dt>
To mortal beauties which no succor bring.
<dt>
But my muse, feathered with an angel's wing,
<dt>
Divinely mounts aloft unto the sky,
<dt>
Where her love's subjects, with my hopes, do lie.
<dt>
For Cupid's darts prefigurate hell's sting;
<dt>
His quenchless torch foreshows hell's quenchless fire,
<dt>
Kindling men's wits with lustful lays of sin
<dt>
Thy wounds my cure, dear Savior! I desire,
<dt>
To pierce my thoughts, thy fiery cherubin,
<dt>
By kindling my desires true zeal t'infuse,
<dt>
Thy love my theme, and Holy Ghost my muse!

  "Fortress of hope, anchor of faithful zeal"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
Fortress of hope, anchor of faithful zeal,
<dt>
Rock of affiance, bulwark of sure trust,
<dt>
In whom all nations for salvation must
<dt>
Put certain confidence of their souls' weal:
<dt>
Those sacred mysteries, dear Lord, reveal
<dt>
Of that large volume, righteous and just.
<dt>
From me, though blinded with this earthly dust
<dt>
Do not those gracious mysteries conceal;
<dt>
That I by them, as from some beamsome lamp,
<dt>
May find the bright and right direction
<dt>
To my soul, blinded, marching to that camp
<dt>
Of sacred soldiers whose protection
<dt>
He that victorious on a white horse rideth
<dt>
Taketh, and evermore triumphant guideth.

  "A blast of wind, a momentary breath"
</H2>
<P>
<A href="#top"><IMG align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></A>
<P>
<dt>
A blast of wind, a momentary breath,
<dt>
A wat'ry bubble symbolized with air,
<dt>
A sun-blown rose, but for a season fair,
<dt>
A ghostly glance, a skeleton of death;
<dt>
A morning dew, pearling the grass beneath,
<dt>
Whose moisture sun's appearance doth impair;
<dt>
A lightning glimpse, a muse of thought and care,
<dt>
A planet's shot, a shade which followeth,
<dt>
A voice which vanisheth so soon as heard,
<dt>
The thriftless heir of time, a rolling wave,
<dt>
A show, no more in action than regard,
<dt>
A mass of dust, world's momentary slave,
<dt>
Is man, in state of our old Adam made,
<dt>
Soon born to die, soon flourishing to fade.
