<p>
<dt>Leisure, thou goddess of a bygone age,
<dt>When hours were long and days sufficed to hold
<dt>Wide-eyed delights and pleasures uncontrolled
<dt>By shortening moments, when no gaunt presage
<dt>Of undone duties, modern heritage,
<dt>Haunted our happy minds; must thou withhold
<dt>Thy presence from this over-busy world,
<dt>And bearing silence with thee disengage
<dt>Our twined fortunes?  Deeps of unhewn woods
<dt>Alone can cherish thee, alone possess
<dt>Thy quiet, teeming vigor.  This our crime:
<dt>Not to have worshipped, marred by alien moods
<dt>That sole condition of all loveliness,
<dt>The dreaming lapse of slow, unmeasured time.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>On Carpaccio's Picture:  The Dream of St. Ursula</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Swept, clean, and still, across the polished floor
<dt>From some unshuttered casement, hid from sight,
<dt>The level sunshine slants, its greater light
<dt>Quenching the little lamp which pallid, poor,
<dt>Flickering, unreplenished, at the door
<dt>Has striven against darkness the long night.
<dt>Dawn fills the room, and penetrating, bright,
<dt>The silent sunbeams through the window pour.
<dt>And she lies sleeping, ignorant of Fate,
<dt>Enmeshed in listless dreams, her soul not yet
<dt>Ripened to bear the purport of this day.
<dt>The morning breeze scarce stirs the coverlet,
<dt>A shadow falls across the sunlight; wait!
<dt>A lark is singing as he flies away.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>The Matrix</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Goaded and harassed in the factory
<dt>That tears our life up into bits of days
<dt>Ticked off upon a clock which never stays,
<dt>Shredding our portion of Eternity,
<dt>We break away at last, and steal the key
<dt>Which hides a world empty of hours; ways
<dt>Of space unroll, and Heaven overlays
<dt>The leafy, sun-lit earth of Fantasy.
<dt>Beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun,
<dt>Scorching against the blue flame of the sky.
<dt>Brown lily-pads lie heavy and supine
<dt>Within a granite basin, under one
<dt>The bronze-gold glimmer of a carp; and I
<dt>Reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine.
<p>
<a name=040></a><h2>Monadnock in Early Spring</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Cloud-topped and splendid, dominating all
<dt>The little lesser hills which compass thee,
<dt>Thou standest, bright with April's buoyancy,
<dt>Yet holding Winter in some shaded wall
<dt>Of stern, steep rock; and startled by the call
<dt>Of Spring, thy trees flush with expectancy
<dt>And cast a cloud of crimson, silently,
<dt>Above thy snowy crevices where fall
<dt>Pale shrivelled oak leaves, while the snow beneath
<dt>Melts at their phantom touch.  Another year
<dt>Is quick with import.  Such each year has been.
<dt>Unmoved thou watchest all, and all bequeath
<dt>Some jewel to thy diadem of power,
<dt>Thou pledge of greater majesty unseen.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>The Little Garden</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A little garden on a bleak hillside
<dt>Where deep the heavy, dazzling mountain snow
<dt>Lies far into the spring.  The sun's pale glow
<dt>Is scarcely able to melt patches wide
<dt>About the single rose bush.  All denied
<dt>Of nature's tender ministries.  But no, --
<dt>For wonder-working faith has made it blow
<dt>With flowers many hued and starry-eyed.
<dt>Here sleeps the sun long, idle summer hours;
<dt>Here butterflies and bees fare far to rove
<dt>Amid the crumpled leaves of poppy flowers;
<dt>Here four o'clocks, to the passionate night above
<dt>Fling whiffs of perfume, like pale incense showers.
<dt>A little garden, loved with a great love!
<p>
<a name=060></a><h2>To an Early Daffodil</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Thou yellow trumpeter of laggard Spring!
<dt>Thou herald of rich Summer's myriad flowers!
<dt>The climbing sun with new recovered powers
<dt>Does warm thee into being, through the ring
<dt>Of rich, brown earth he woos thee, makes thee fling
<dt>Thy green shoots up, inheriting the dowers
<dt>Of bending sky and sudden, sweeping showers,
<dt>Till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing
<dt>To make all nature glad, thou art so gay;
<dt>To fill the lonely with a joy untold;
<dt>Nodding at every gust of wind to-day,
<dt>To-morrow jewelled with raindrops.  Always bold
<dt>To stand erect, full in the dazzling play
<dt>Of April's sun, for thou hast caught his gold.
<p>
<a name=070></a><h2>The Lamp of Life</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Always we are following a light,
<dt>Always the light recedes; with groping hands
<dt>We stretch toward this glory, while the lands
<dt>We journey through are hidden from our sight
<dt>Dim and mysterious, folded deep in night,
<dt>We care not, all our utmost need demands
<dt>Is but the light, the light!  So still it stands
<dt>Surely our own if we exert our might.
<dt>Fool!  Never can'st thou grasp this fleeting gleam,
<dt>Its glowing flame would die if it were caught,
<dt>Its value is that it doth always seem
<dt>But just a little farther on.  Distraught,
<dt>But lighted ever onward, we are brought
<dt>Upon our way unknowing, in a dream.
<p>
<a name=080></a><h2>Hero-Worship</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>A face seen passing in a crowded street,
<dt>A voice heard singing music, large and free;
<dt>And from that moment life is changed, and we
<dt>Become of more heroic temper, meet
<dt>To freely ask and give, a man complete
<dt>Radiant because of faith, we dare to be
<dt>What Nature meant us.  Brave idolatry
<dt>Which can conceive a hero!  No deceit,
<dt>No knowledge taught by unrelenting years,
<dt>Can quench this fierce, untamable desire.
<dt>We know that what we long for once achieved
<dt>Will cease to satisfy.  Be still our fears;
<dt>If what we worship fail us, still the fire
<dt>Burns on, and it is much to have believed.
<p>
<a name=090></a><h2>In Darkness</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Must all of worth be travailled for, and those
<dt>Life's brightest stars rise from a troubled sea?
<dt>Must years go by in sad uncertainty
<dt>Leaving us doubting whose the conquering blows,
<dt>Are we or Fate the victors?  Time which shows
<dt>All inner meanings will reveal, but we
<dt>Shall never know the upshot.  Ours to be
<dt>Wasted with longing, shattered in the throes,
<dt>The agonies of splendid dreams, which day
<dt>Dims from our vision, but each night brings back;
<dt>We strive to hold their grandeur, and essay
<dt>To be the thing we dream.  Sudden we lack
<dt>The flash of insight, life grows drear and gray,
<dt>And hour follows hour, nerveless, slack.
<p>
<a name=100></a><h2>Before Dawn</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Life!  Austere arbiter of each man's fate,
<dt>By whom he learns that Nature's steadfast laws
<dt>Are as decrees immutable; O pause
<dt>Your even forward march!  Not yet too late
<dt>Teach me the needed lesson, when to wait
<dt>Inactive as a ship when no wind draws
<dt>To stretch the loosened cordage.  One implores
<dt>Thy clemency, whose wilfulness innate
<dt>Has gone uncurbed and roughshod while the years
<dt>Have lengthened into decades; now distressed
<dt>He knows no rule by which to move or stay,
<dt>And teased with restlessness and desperate fears
<dt>He dares not watch in silence thy wise way
<dt>Bringing about results none could have guessed.
<p>
<a name=110></a><h2>The Poet </h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What instinct forces man to journey on,
<dt>Urged by a longing blind but dominant!
<dt>Nothing he sees can hold him, nothing daunt
<dt>His never failing eagerness.  The sun
<dt>Setting in splendour every night has won
<dt>His vassalage; those towers flamboyant
<dt>Of airy cloudland palaces now haunt
<dt>His daylight wanderings.  Forever done
<dt>With simple joys and quiet happiness
<dt>He guards the vision of the sunset sky;
<dt>Though faint with weariness he must possess
<dt>Some fragment of the sunset's majesty;
<dt>He spurns life's human friendships to profess
<dt>Life's loneliness of dreaming ecstasy.
<p>
<a name=120></a><h2>At Night </h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The wind is singing through the trees to-night,
<dt>A deep-voiced song of rushing cadences
<dt>And crashing intervals.  No summer breeze
<dt>Is this, though hot July is at its height,
<dt>Gone is her gentler music; with delight
<dt>She listens to this booming like the seas,
<dt>These elemental, loud necessities
<dt>Which call to her to answer their swift might.
<dt>Above the tossing trees shines down a star,
<dt>Quietly bright; this wild, tumultuous joy
<dt>Quickens nor dims its splendour.  And my mind,
<dt>O Star! is filled with your white light, from far,
<dt>So suffer me this one night to enjoy
<dt>The freedom of the onward sweeping wind.
<p>
<a name=130></a><h2>The Fruit Garden Path</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>The path runs straight between the flowering rows,
<dt>A moonlit path, hemmed in by beds of bloom,
<dt>Where phlox and marigolds dispute for room
<dt>With tall, red dahlias and the briar rose.
<dt>'T is reckless prodigality which throws
<dt>Into the night these wafts of rich perfume
<dt>Which sweep across the garden like a plume.
<dt>Over the trees a single bright star glows.
<dt>Dear garden of my childhood, here my years
<dt>Have run away like little grains of sand;
<dt>The moments of my life, its hopes and fears
<dt>Have all found utterance here, where now I stand;
<dt>My eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears,
<dt>You are my home, do you not understand?
<p>
<a name=140></a><h2>Mirage</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How is it that, being gone, you fill my days,
<dt>And all the long nights are made glad by thee?
<dt>No loneliness is this, nor misery,
<dt>But great content that these should be the ways
<dt>Whereby the Fancy, dreaming as she strays,
<dt>Makes bright and present what she would would be.
<dt>And who shall say if the reality
<dt>Is not with dreams so pregnant.  For delays
<dt>And hindrances may bar the wished-for end;
<dt>A thousand misconceptions may prevent
<dt>Our souls from coming near enough to blend;
<dt>Let me but think we have the same intent,
<dt>That each one needs to call the other, "friend!"
<dt>It may be vain illusion.  I'm content.
<p>
<a name=150></a><h2>To a Friend</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I ask but one thing of you, only one,
<dt>That always you will be my dream of you;
<dt>That never shall I wake to find untrue
<dt>All this I have believed and rested on,
<dt>Forever vanished, like a vision gone
<dt>Out into the night.  Alas, how few
<dt>There are who strike in us a chord we knew
<dt>Existed, but so seldom heard its tone
<dt>We tremble at the half-forgotten sound.
<dt>The world is full of rude awakenings
<dt>And heaven-born castles shattered to the ground,
<dt>Yet still our human longing vainly clings
<dt>To a belief in beauty through all wrongs.
<dt>O stay your hand, and leave my heart its songs!
<p>
<a name=160></a><h2>A Fixed Idea</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>What torture lurks within a single thought
<dt>When grown too constant, and however kind,
<dt>However welcome still, the weary mind
<dt>Aches with its presence.  Dull remembrance taught
<dt>Remembers on unceasingly; unsought
<dt>The old delight is with us but to find
<dt>That all recurring joy is pain refined,
<dt>Become a habit, and we struggle, caught.
<dt>You lie upon my heart as on a nest,
<dt>Folded in peace, for you can never know
<dt>How crushed I am with having you at rest
<dt>Heavy upon my life.  I love you so
<dt>You bind my freedom from its rightful quest.
<dt>In mercy lift your drooping wings and go.
<p>
<a name=170></a><h2>Dreams</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I do not care to talk to you although
<dt>Your speech evokes a thousand sympathies,
<dt>And all my being's silent harmonies
<dt>Wake trembling into music.  When you go
<dt>It is as if some sudden, dreadful blow
<dt>Had severed all the strings with savage ease.
<dt>No, do not talk; but let us rather seize
<dt>This intimate gift of silence which we know.
<dt>Others may guess your thoughts from what you say,
<dt>As storms are guessed from clouds where darkness broods.
<dt>To me the very essence of the day
<dt>Reveals its inner purpose and its moods;
<dt>As poplars feel the rain and then straightway
<dt>Reverse their leaves and shimmer through the woods.
<p>
<a name=180></a><h2>Frankincense and Myrrh</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My heart is tuned to sorrow, and the strings
<dt>Vibrate most readily to minor chords,
<dt>Searching and sad; my mind is stuffed with words
<dt>Which voice the passion and the ache of things:
<dt>Illusions beating with their baffled wings
<dt>Against the walls of circumstance, and hoards
<dt>Of torn desires, broken joys; records
<dt>Of all a bruised life's maimed imaginings.
<dt>Now you are come!  You tremble like a star
<dt>Poised where, behind earth's rim, the sun has set.
<dt>Your voice has sung across my heart, but numb
<dt>And mute, I have no tones to answer.  Far
<dt>Within I kneel before you, speechless yet,
<dt>And life ablaze with beauty, I am dumb.
<p>
<a name=190></a><h2>From One Who Stays</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>How empty seems the town now you are gone!
<dt>A wilderness of sad streets, where gaunt walls
<dt>Hide nothing to desire; sunshine falls
<dt>Eery, distorted, as it long had shone
<dt>On white, dead faces tombed in halls of stone.
<dt>The whir of motors, stricken through with calls
<dt>Of playing boys, floats up at intervals;
<dt>But all these noises blur to one long moan.
<dt>What quest is worth pursuing?  And how strange
<dt>That other men still go accustomed ways!
<dt>I hate their interest in the things they do.
<dt>A spectre-horde repeating without change
<dt>An old routine.  Alone I know the days
<dt>Are still-born, and the world stopped, lacking you.
<p>
<a name=200></a><h2>Crepuscule du Matin</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>All night I wrestled with a memory
<dt>Which knocked insurgent at the gates of thought.
<dt>The crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought
<dt>Its disillusion; now I only cry
<dt>For peace, for power to forget the lie
<dt>Which hope too long has whispered.  So I sought
<dt>The sleep which would not come, and night was fraught
<dt>With old emotions weeping silently.
<dt>I heard your voice again, and knew the things
<dt>Which you had promised proved an empty vaunt.
<dt>I felt your clinging hands while night's broad wings
<dt>Cherished our love in darkness.  From the lawn
<dt>A sudden, quivering birdnote, like a taunt.
<dt>My arms held nothing but the empty dawn.
<p>
<a name=210></a><h2>Aftermath</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I learnt to write to you in happier days,
<dt>And every letter was a piece I chipped
<dt>From off my heart, a fragment newly clipped
<dt>From the mosaic of life; its blues and grays,
<dt>Its throbbing reds, I gave to earn your praise.
<dt>To make a pavement for your feet I stripped
<dt>My soul for you to walk upon, and slipped
<dt>Beneath your steps to soften all your ways.
<dt>But now my letters are like blossoms pale
<dt>We strew upon a grave with hopeless tears.
<dt>I ask no recompense, I shall not fail
<dt>Although you do not heed; the long, sad years
<dt>Still pass, and still I scatter flowers frail,
<dt>And whisper words of love which no one hears.
<p>
<a name=220></a><h2>The End</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Throughout the echoing chambers of my brain
<dt>I hear your words in mournful cadence toll
<dt>Like some slow passing-bell which warns the soul
<dt>Of sundering darkness.  Unrelenting, fain
<dt>To batter down resistance, fall again
<dt>Stroke after stroke, insistent diastole,
<dt>The bitter blows of truth, until the whole
<dt>Is hammered into fact made strangely plain.
<dt>Where shall I look for comfort?  Not to you.
<dt>Our worlds are drawn apart, our spirit's suns
<dt>Divided, and the light of mine burnt dim.
<dt>Now in the haunted twilight I must do
<dt>Your will.  I grasp the cup which over-runs,
<dt>And with my trembling lips I touch the rim.
<p>

<p>
<h3>"'I can't get out', said the starling."</h3>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterne's 'Sentimental Journey'.</h3>
<p>
<dt>Forever the impenetrable wall
<dt>Of self confines my poor rebellious soul,
<dt>I never see the towering white clouds roll
<dt>Before a sturdy wind, save through the small
<dt>Barred window of my jail.  I live a thrall
<dt>With all my outer life a clipped, square hole,
<dt>Rectangular; a fraction of a scroll
<dt>Unwound and winding like a worsted ball.
<dt>My thoughts are grown uneager and depressed
<dt>Through being always mine, my fancy's wings
<dt>Are moulted and the feathers blown away.
<dt>I weary for desires never guessed,
<dt>For alien passions, strange imaginings,
<dt>To be some other person for a day.
<p>
<a name=240></a><h2>Market Day</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>White, glittering sunlight fills the market square,
<dt>Spotted and sprigged with shadows.  Double rows
<dt>Of bartering booths spread out their tempting shows
<dt>Of globed and golden fruit, the morning air
<dt>Smells sweet with ripeness, on the pavement there
<dt>A wicker basket gapes and overflows
<dt>Spilling out cool, blue plums.  The market glows,
<dt>And flaunts, and clatters in its busy care.
<dt>A stately minster at the northern side
<dt>Lifts its twin spires to the distant sky,
<dt>Pinnacled, carved and buttressed; through the wide
<dt>Arched doorway peals an organ, suddenly --
<dt>Crashing, triumphant in its pregnant tide,
<dt>Quenching the square in vibrant harmony.

<h3>GEORGE  AUGUSTUS  CLOUGH</h3>

<p>
<dt>He died of "Stranger's Fever" when his youth

<dt>The chiselled legend runs; a brother's woe
<dt>Laid bare for epitaph.  The savage ruth

<dt>With cruel caressing dealt a mortal blow,
<dt>And by this summer sea where flowers grow
<dt>In tropic splendor, witness to the truth
<dt>Of ineradicable race he lies.
<dt>The law of duty urged that he should roam,
<dt>Should sail from fog and chilly airs to skies

<p>
<dt>Poor foolish monarch, vacillating, vain,

<dt>Of sacrificial fires burst their rings
<dt>And blotted out in smoke his lost domain.
<dt>Bereft of courtiers, only with his queen,
<dt>From empty palace down to empty quay.
<dt>No challenge screamed from hostile carabine.
<dt>A single vessel waited, shadowy;

<dt>The spiced winds which blew when earth was young,
<dt>Scattering wreaths of stars, as Jove once flung
<dt>A golden shower from heights cerulean.
<dt>Crumbled before thy majesty we bow.
<dt>Forget thy empurpled state, thy panoply
