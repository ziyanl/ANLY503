<dt>The darkness throbbed that night with the great heat,
<dt>And my heart throbbed at thought of what should be;
<dt>The house was dumb, the lock slid silently;
<dt>I only heard the night's hot pulses beat
<dt>Around me as I sped with quiet feet
<dt>Down the dark corridors; and once the sea
<dt>Moaned in its slumber, and I stayed, but she
<dt>Came forth to meet me lily-white and sweet.
<p>
<dt>Was there a man's soul ever worth her kiss?
<dt>Silent and still I stood, and she drew near,
<dt>And her lips mixed with mine, and her sweet breath
<dt>Fanned my hot face; and afterward I wis,
<dt>What the sea said to us I did not hear;
<dt>But now I know it spake of Doom and Death.

<p>
<dt>O Death, Death, Death! Thou art the Lord of all,
<dt>And at Thy temple, where for Thee are shed
<dt>Man's blood and tears: gods, kings, and temples fall;
<dt>Thy reign, O Lord, is immemorial:
<dt>Ever thou waxest stronger and more dread,
<dt>More populous grows Thy kingdom of the dead,
<dt>And joy and love and hope Thou hast in thrall.
<p>
<dt>We follow vain desires and idle things,
<dt>We vex our souls with hollow hopes and fears,
<dt>We dread the future and regret the past:
<dt>Thou comest, O Almighty, King of kings,
<dt>And stillest all the tumult of the years,
<dt>And tak'st each babbler to thy breast at last.
