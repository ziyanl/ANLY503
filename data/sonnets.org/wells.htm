<dt>Pale roamer of the midnight hour! when blow
<dt>The cutting winds and beat the pouring rain,
<dt>Then I bethink on thee and all the pain
<dt>You oft endure. It is seldom thine to know
<dt>The look benignant: and but few bestow
<dt>The gentle smile which timely might restrain
<dt>Thy course licentious.--Thus from care and woe
<dt>With insults vile proceeds thy hard-earned gain.
<p>
<dt>Pale roamer, when I view thy haggard look,
<dt>Thy blue and quivering lip and sunken eye;
<dt>Hear thee accost each stranger passing by
<dt>In accents mild--to whom who thus forsook
<dt>Thee in thy hour of need, my heart has turned
<dt>And with a curse his unknown form I've spurned.
