<p>This elegant sonnet-writer, and accomplished and delightful man, as he is described to me by a friend who knew him well, was born at Tiverton, Devonshire, 4 May, 1785, and received his early education at Blundell's School there. He became Rector of Broughton Gifford, Wilts, in 1812, which he resigned in 1848; and died at Dawlish, Devonshire, 27 January, 1864. Besides his original sonnets, he published (anonymously) <i>Specimens of Sonnets from the Most Celebrated Italian Poets, with Translations</i> (1827), the firstfruits of a love for the arts and literature of Italy, imbibed during a visit to that country in 1821-2. It is to Strong that the distich in Elton's metrical epistle to Clare refers (Cherry's <i>Life and Remains of John Clare</i>, 1873, p. 71): "Our English Petrach trundles down/To Devon's valley."

<a name=010></a><h2>Time's Defeat</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Time, I rejoice, amid the ruin wide
<dt>That peoples thy dark empire, to behold
<dt>Shores against which thy waves in vain have rolled,
<dt>Where man's proud works still frown above thy tide.
<dt>The deep-based pyramids still turn aside
<dt>Thy wasteful currents, vigorously old
<dt>Lucania's temples their array unfold,
<dt>Pillar and portico, in simple pride.
<p>
<dt>Nor less my joy, when, sheltered from thy storms
<dt>In earth's fond breast, hid treasure bursts the sod,
<dt>Elaborate stone in sculpture's matchless forms.
<dt>Oft did I mock thee, spoiler, as I trod
<dt>The glowing courts where still the goddess warms,
<dt>And stern in beauty stands the quivered god.
<p>
<a name=020></a><h2>Sunrise</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>I stood at gaze where the free hills arise,
<dt>Whence rocks mid deepest solitudes are seen,
<dt>And glimmering through dark foliage, the blue sheen
<dt>Of ocean stained with heaven's own sapphire dyes:
<dt>Then into the deep air I raised my eyes;
<dt>The steadfast dome was cloudless and serene,
<dt>Fit roof to over-arch so fair a scene,
<dt>For earth in loveliness vied with the skies.
<p>
<dt>Enrolled, methought, among a happier race,
<dt>I felt immortal moments as I said,
<dt>Death finds no entrance here, and sin no place;
<dt>Then quick to mark where recent footsteps led,
<dt>I saw one bending over the furrow's trace,
<dt>And on his brow the primal sentence read.
<p>
<a name=030></a><h2>Nature</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>My window's open to the evening sky,
<dt>The solemn trees are fringed with golden light,
<dt>The lawn here shadowed lies, there kindles bright,
<dt>And cherished roses lift their incense high:
<dt>The punctual thrush, on plane-tree warbling nigh,
<dt>With loud and luscious voice calls down the night;
<dt>Dim waters, flowing on with gentle might,
<dt>Between each pause are heard to murmur by.
<p>
<dt>The book that told of wars in holy land
<dt>(Nor less than Tasso sounded in mine ears)
<dt>Escapes unheeded from my listless hand.
<dt>Poets, whom nature for her service rears,
<dt>Like priests in her great temple ministering stand,
<dt>But in her glory fade when she appears.
<p>
<a name=050></a><h2>"Is this the spot where Rome's eternal foe"</h2><a href="#top"><img align=right border=0 src="handup.gif"></a>
<p>
<dt>Is this the spot where Rome's eternal foe
<dt>Into his snares the mighty legions drew,
<dt>Whence from the carnage, spiritless and few,
<dt>A remnant scarcely reached her gates of woe?
<dt>Is this the stream, thus gliding soft and slow,
<dt>That from the gushing wounds of thousands, grew
<dt>So fierce a flood, that waves of crimson hue
<dt>Rushed on the bosom of the lake below?
<dt>The mountains that gave back the battle-cry
<dt>Are silent now; perchance yon hillocks green
<dt>Mark where the bones of those old warriors lie.
<dt>Heaven never gladdened a more peaceful scene;
<dt>Never left softer breeze a fairer sky
<dt>To sport upon thy waters, Thrasymene!
