<p>
<dt>Yon silvery billows breaking on the beach
<dt>Fall back in foam beneath the star-shine clear,
<dt>The while my rhymes are murmuring in your ear
<dt>A restless lore like that the billows teach;
<dt>For on these sonnet-waves my soul would reach
<dt>From its own depths, and rest within you, dear,
<dt>As, through the billowy voices yearning here,
<dt>Great nature strives to find a human speech.
<dt>A sonnet is a wave of melody:
<dt>From heaving waters of the impassion'd soul
<dt>A billow of tidal music one and whole
<dt>Flows in the "octave;" then returning free,
<dt>Its ebbing surges in the "sestet" roll
<dt>Back to the deeps of Life's tumultuous sea.

<p>
<dt>I see thee pine like her in golden story
<dt>Who, in her prison, woke and saw, one day,
<dt>The gates thrown open--saw the sunbeams play,
<dt>With only a web 'tween her and summer's glory;
<dt>Who, when that web--so frail, so transitory
<dt>It broke before her breath--had fallen away,
<dt>Saw other webs and others rise for aye
<dt>Which kept her prison'd till her hair was hoary.
<dt>Those songs half-sung that yet were all-divine--
<dt>That woke Romance, the queen, to reign afresh--
<dt>Had been but preludes from that lyre of thine,
<dt>Could thy rare spirit's wings have pierced the mesh
<dt>Spun by the wizard who compels the flesh,
<dt>But lets the poet see how heav'n can shine.

<h3>(THE STARS IN THE RIVER)</h3>
<p>
<dt>The mirrored stars lit all the bulrush spears,
<dt>And all the flags and broad-leaved lily-isles;
<dt>The ripples shook the stars to golden smiles,
<dt>Then smoothed them back to happy golden spheres.
<dt>We rowed--we sang; her voice seemed, in mine ears,
<dt>An angel's, yet with woman's dearest wiles;
<dt>But shadows fell from gathering cloudy piles
<dt>And ripples shook the stars to fiery tears.
<p>
<dt>God shaped the shadows like a phantom boat
<dt>Where sate her soul and mine in Doom's attire;
<dt>Along the lily-isles I saw it float
<dt>Where ripples shook the stars to symbols dire;
<dt>We wept--we kissed, while starry fingers wrote,
<dt>And ripples shook the stars to a snake of fire.
