ANYONE HAVE ANY ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO PREVENT THAT TERRIBLE WHITE GREY WORN FOLD LINE FORMING ON FOLDING BOARDS

I KNOW SOME PEOPLE FRAME THE BOARD TO KEEP IT FLAT BUT I DON'T HAVE THE SPACE TO STORE THAT
I'M TRYING TO FIND A GAME TO PLAY WITH MY DAD I'M VERY MUCH INTO GAMES OF THE VIDEO VARIETY BUT I'VE ALSO QUITE ENJOYED PLAYING A DIGITAL VERSION OF THE LOAR CG BY MYSELF AND WITH A FRIEND OF MINE MY DAD DOESN'T GAME OF ANY VARIETY MUCH AT ALL HE ENJOYS PLAYING GAMES ON FACEBOOK THAT MIMIC CASINO GAMES SLOTS ETC AND COMPARABLY SIMPLE GAMES I THINK THESE ARE THE CRITERIA I'M LOOKING FOR

ENOUGH COMPLEXITY FOR ME BUT NOT TOO COMPLEX FOR HIM

COOPERATIVE I THINK BUT OPEN TO COMPETITIVE GAMES

PLAYS WELL WITH ONE PERSON ME AND I'LL ENJOY IT IN CASE HE DOESN'T

I ORDERED AN LOAR CG CORE SET AND MAGE KNIGHT BASE GAME FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN THEM I'M NOT SURE IF HE'LL LIKE THEM I HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY EITHER WITH HIM YET
I'M ABOUT TO START PAINTING UP MY MINIATURES FROM SD F I HAVE NO IDEA ON UNDERCOAT BRANDS I WILL BE LOOKING TO USE BLACK OR GREY

I'D APPRECIATE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS I'M IN ELB AUS FOR AVAILABILITY IF THAT MATTERS THANKS VERY MUCH
FOR A GAME GROUP THAT HAS NEVER PLAYED D D OR ANY GAME WITH MINIATURES BUT MAY BE WILLING TO TRY THEM OUT INCLUDING MYSELF IS JUMPING INTO THE KD M KICKSTARTER TOO AMBITIOUS AND CRAZY TO START OFF WITH
MY GROUP REALLY LIKES BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL MOSTLY FOR THE SHORTISH PLAY TIME THE RANDOM BOARD BUILDING AN HORROR THEMES ARE THERE ANY OTHER GAMES OUT THERE WITH SIMILAR MECHANICS THAT WE MIGHT ENJOY
MY GAMING GROUP IS MOSTLY SOMETIMES PLAYERS AND WE MEET UP PRETTY MUCH EVERY WEEKEND I REALLY WANT TO BUY BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA BUT AM RELUCTANT BECAUSE I HAVE READ IT IS SO MUCH BETTER WITH PLAYERS THAN ANY OTHER NUMBER IS IT WORTH BUYING IF WE WILL ONLY HAVE PLAYERS MAX
WHEN PLAYING DOMINION WITH MULTIPLE EXPANSIONS HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH ADDITIONAL VICTORY TREASURE CARDS TO USE IF ANY
ARE THERE OTHER BOARD GAMES THAT USES A SUPPLY AND DEMAND MECHANIC SIMILAR TO POWER GRID'S RESOURCES WHERE IT REPLENISHES AT A CERTAIN RATE AT VARIOUS PARTS OF THE GAME
I STORE MY BOARD GAMES IN THE TRUNK OF MY CAR WELL WINTER IS COMING AND IT HAS STARTED TO SNOW OVER HERE WITH WEATHER RANGING FROM TO IS IT OKAY TO LEAVE THEM IN THE TRUNK OF MY CAR SHOULD I BE CONCERNED WHEN I PULL THEM OUT AND THEY'RE REALLY COLD
EDIT I'M HEARING MIXED REVIEWS SO BACK TO SQUARE ONE I GUESS
I JUST GOT POWER GRID AND IT CAME WITH PLASTIC BAGGIES BUT I AM NOT SURE HOW TO DIVIDE IT AS THERE AREN'T AS MANY BAGGIES AS THERE ARE TYPES OF PIECES HOW SHOULD THEY BE PUT AWAY AS ITS REALLY BOTHERING ME

PLAYED KING OF TOKYO LAST NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH MY AT THE LIBRARY CAN YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE CARD IN YOUR HAND THE ONES THAT YOU CAN BUY OFF THE BOARD WITH ENERGY CUBES
DOES ANY ONE KNOW A SERVICE THAT CREATES BOARD GAME PLASTIC DECKS WITH INK LAMINATED WITHIN THE CARD I HAVE A FEW BOARD GAME DECKS AND CARD GAMES THAT GET USED OFTEN AND HAVE HAD TO BUY MULTIPLE DECKS FOR

AN EXAMPLE IS UNO SPLASH THEY HAVE A VERSION OF DURABLE PLASTIC CARDS BUT THEY PRINT ON TOP OF THE CARD THE THE INK STARTS TO FADE OUT BECAUSE THE INK ISN'T EMBEDDED WITHIN THE PLASTIC CARD

I ALSO BOUGHT EXPLODING CATS FOR THANKSGIVING AND EVERYONE LOVED IT BUT THE CARD QUALITY ISN'T GREAT SO SOME OF THE EDGES ARE STARTING TO FRAY ALREADY

I WOULD DEFINITELY BE WILLING TO PAY EXTRA TO ORDER MORE DURABLE SETS OF THE GAMES I MOST LOVE BUT I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING ONLINE
I RECENTLY BOUGHT RISK LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY EDITION FOR MY GIRLFRIEND FROM SOMEONE ONLINE IT WASN'T IN MANUFACTURER PACKAGING DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE AND ME BEING THE CLEAN FREAK I AM I WANT TO CLEAN IT ALL UP BEFORE GIVING IT TO HERALDRY HOW CAN I CLEAN THE LITTLE PLASTIC PIECES DICE AND CARDS WITHOUT DAMAGING ANY OF THEM I WAS THINKING OF PLACING THE PLASTIC FIGURES IN A BOWL OF WATER WITH A DROP OF DAWN BUT I'M AFRAID IT'LL DAMAGE THE PLASTIC
WITH THE HOLIDAYS COMING UP WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST AS A GIFT TO SOMEONE WHO LIKES

ASCENSION DECKBUILDER

DOMINION

CATAN

MAGIC TCG

MUNCHKIN
IS IT JUST ME OR WERE THE BOARDGAMING DEALS FOR BLACK FRIDAY AND CYBER MONDAY THIS YEAR JUST NOT EXCITING EVEN THE ONES SEEMED LACKLUSTER AM I JUST GETTING CYNICAL WITH AGE
DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY GOOD ENTRY LEVEL MINIATURE GAME SUGGESTIONS I REALLY WANT TO GET INTO MORE STORY DRIVEN RPG LIKE GAMES BUT A DON'T HAVE A GROUP OF FRIENDS WHO LIKE BOARD GAMES LIKE I DO IN MY AREA SO HARD TO FIND PEOPLE TO INTRODUCE ME TO NEW GAMES AND B MY WIFE LIKE BOARD GAMES AND PLAYS WITH ME BUT SOME OF THE MORE COMPLEX RPG ONES SHE ISN'T HUGE ON BUT IS WILLING TO TRY

SO IF ANYBODY KNOWS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR GOOD ONES THAT I CAN EITHER PLAY SOLO AS A NEWBIE TO THE GENRE OR CAN PLAY AS 2 PEOPLE THAT IS EASY ENOUGH FOR HER TO GRASP WOULD BE PREFERED


THANK YOU IN ADVANCE ALL
IN THIS THREAD

PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE THE GAME WHAT IT'S OVERPRICED

PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE GAME IT'S WORTH IT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL GAME
GOLD FROM THE QA PAGE

I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING FUNNY OR COOL ABOUT FASCISM WHO CAN I COMPLAIN TO

PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD J TRUMP 5TH AVENUE
NEW YORK NY

SHOTS FIRED
I AM IN GERMANY AND GOT THE GAME ON KICKSTARTER ONLY REALISED AFTER I BACKED IT THAT NEITHER ME NOR MY FRIENDS ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE FOR THIS SORT OF BLUFFING GAME I BACKED IT AFTER THE CH GUYS RECOMMENDED IT AND WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING MORE DOWN THAT ALLEY

ANYWAY IF YOU WANT THE GAME AND ARE IN EUROPE I AM GLADLY SELLING IT FOR SHIPPING BUT NOT IN THE WOODEN BOX JUST IN THE CARDBOARD BOX THAT WAS INSIDE THE WOODEN ONE

EDIT GOT ALL YOUR MESSAGES AND WILL WORK THROUGH THEM IN THE FIRST COME FIRST SERVE FASHION
NOW IF ONLY I GOT MY COPY I BOUGHT MONTHS AGO AT PAX EAST
GOT IT ON KICKSTARTER STILL WAITING FOR MY PLEDGE TO COME IN
I BOUGHT IT IMMEDIATELY I SPENT SOME TIME MAKING MY PRINT AND PLAY VERSION DECENT AND MY GROUP HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF MILEAGE OUT OF IT WE'RE NORMALLY

THE PRICE DOESN'T BOTHER ME AND I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PICKED IT UP EVEN IF IT COST MORE I HAVEN'T BEEN INTO BOARD GAMES FOR THAT LONG AND DON'T HAVE THAT MANY OF THEM VIDEO GAMES ARE MY PRIMARY HOBBY SO WHEN I SEE I THINK THAT'S PRETTY CHEAP
WOW THIS PRICE TRIPLE WHAT RESISTANCE COSTS I GUESS I'LL STICK TO THE FOR NOW
THIS SERIOUSLY FRUSTRATES ME THAT I PAID MORE FOR THIS GAME ALMOST A YEAR AGO AND I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN MY COPY YET ANYONE WITH AMAZON PRIME CAN GET IT AT ANYTIME SIGH
IT'S COMPLETE BS THAT IT IS AVAILABLE ON AMAZON BEFORE PAX EAST BUYERS EVEN GET SHIPPING EMAILS
STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE COPY I BOUGHT AT PAX EAST
WE THIS GAME FROM THEM AT PAX EAST WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE RUN AROUND FOR MONTHS NOW WE WERE SUPPOSED RO RECEIVE IT IN MAY THEN IT WAS JUNE THEN SEPTEMBER THEN NOVEMBER AND STILL NO SIGN OF IT

MY FRIEND IS IN THE SAME BOAT WTF WE ORDERED THIS GAME ALMOST A YEAR AGO WHAT GIVES HOW DO WE GET A COPY THAT WE ARE OWED THIS IS RIDICULOUS
I ADMIT I'M NOT SURE I'LL PICK THIS UP I'VE DEFINITELY USED UP MY BOARD GAME BUDGET FOR THE YEAR PLUS I'M CONSIDERING AVALON INSTEAD ANYONE PLAY BOTH AND HAVE ANY ADVICE WHEN I CAN AFFORD IT NEXT YEAR
LOTS OF PEOPLE ITT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRICE TAG I BOUGHT IT ON KICKSTARTER AND SPENT US TO GET IT IN CANADA WITH THE WOODEN BOX AND I THINK IT WAS WORTH EVERY CENTURY

EVERYONE I'VE PLAYED THIS WITH LOVES IT EVERY TIME IT'S PLAYED THE GAMES KEEP GOING FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND NO ONE WANTS TO QUIT IT'S A LOT OF FUN AND SERIOUSLY WORTH THE IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT IF NOT THERE'S A FREE PRINTABLE VERSION ON THEIR WEBSITE
YOU GUYS ARE MONSTERS IT'S ALREADY SOLD OUT
UGH THAT SITE COULD USE SOME WORK OVERFLOWING TEXT NECESSARY HOVER EVENTS ALL THAT SCROLLING IM SURE THE BACKGROUND GIF DOESNT PLAY NICE ON MOBILE NOT TO MENTION ITS SUPER DISTRACTING
DOES IT STILL HAVE PLAYER ELIMINATION I REMEMBER HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THAT WHEN THE KICKSTARTER LAUNCHED AND HOPED THEY WILL CHANGE THAT RULE IN A SPECIFIC GAME TEST WE DID IN OUR GROUP I WAS ELIMINATED FIRST AND WAITED MINUTES FOR THE GAME TO END LOOKING AT EVERYONE ELSE THAT NEVER HAPPENED TO ME WITH OTHER GAMES
GOT IT THROUGH KS A WHILE BACK GAME IS DISAPPOINTING FASCISTS HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME TO WIN ALL THE LIBERALS NEED TO FIND ARE TWO PEOPLE NOT SITTING NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND KEEP PICKING EACH OTHER TO BE CHANCELLORS WHEN THEY ARE PRESIDENTS TWO FREE LIBERAL POLICIES BEFORE IT GETS BACK TO YOUR TURN
HOPEFULLY THAT MEANS I'LL BE RECEIVING MY PAX EAST ORDER OF IT VERY SOON EXCITED
US ONLY NOO

I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO GET A LEGIT COPY FOREVER HOPEFULLY SOME AUSTRALIAN SITE WILL HAVE IT BEFORE XMAS
I'D BUY IT BUT AMAZON IS SOLD OUT AND I'M NOT PUTTING MY CC INFO INTO THEIR WEBSITE UNTIL THEY FIX THEIR SS
HAD IT A FEW MONTHS NOW BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND PLENTY REPAYABLE WORTH THE MONEY
THE COMPONENTS OF SECRET HITLER ARE GORGEOUS AND THE PRICE SEEMS FAIR
I MAINTAIN MY TWO CRITICISMS OF THIS GAME THE FIRST BEING THAT THE TITLE IS THE PRODUCT EQUIVALENT OF CLICKBAIT AND THE SECOND BEING THAT AVALON IS STILL CATEGORICALLY A BETTER GAME REGARDLESS I WISH THEM WELL AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE ANOTHER SMALL PUBLISHER MAKING IT WORK
GREAT RELEASED FOR THE US IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL HAVE TO WAIT

SUCH A SHAME AS I PLAYED IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND IT IS GREAT
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR AWHILE JUST PLACED MY ORDER
OK I'M GONNA BITE AND ASK THE QUESTION WHAT THE LIVING HELL IS WITH THE RANDOM DOWNVOTES ALL THE WAY THROUGH THIS POST LIKE THERE'S HEAPS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING A PERFECTLY CIVIL CONVERSATION OR POSTING FACTUAL INFORMATION WITH THEIR COMMENTS SITTING ON ZERO
I LIKE IT BETTER THAN AVALON BUT NOT AS MUCH AS HAVING
YEAH WOW I GOT THE TEXT THE SECOND I OPENED THIS FREAKED ME OUT A LITTLE UNFORTUNATELY I ALREADY SPENT MY ALLOTTED FUN MONEY LAST NIGHT
I MEAN THE GAME IS FUN BUT IT ISN'T REALLY BETTER THAN THE RESISTANCE THE COMPONENTS LOOK NICE BUT IS JUST A RIDICULOUS PRICE THIS MIGHT BE A CASE WHERE THE GAME IS OVERPRODUCED
I REALLY LIKED THIS GAME FOR A WHILE TILL WE FOUND WHAT I CONSIDERED AN BUG IN THE GAME THE GROUP WOULD ONLY VOTE FOR THE SAME PERSON TO BE THE CHANCELLOR THAT THEY BELIEVED TO BE A LIBERAL THAT PERSON PASSED LIBERAL POLICIES ONLY SO THAT MUST BE A LIBERAL IS WHAT THE THINKING IS IF YOU WENT AGAINST VOTING THE SAME PERSON FOR CHANCELLOR THEN YOU ARE LABELED AS THE FASCIST AND WILL GET IMMEDIATELY VETOED EVERY TIME MAYBE I MISSED IT IN THE RULES FOR THE BUT AS FAR AS WHAT WE INTERPRETED YOU CAN MAKE THE SAME PERSON CHANCELLOR OVER AND OVER AGAIN ITS HAS MADE THE GAME PRETTY POINTLESS TO ME VOTE THE SAME PERSON AS CHANCELLOR OR GET LABELED

ANY ONE ELSE EXPERIENCE THIS ISSUE
US ONLY
NO CANADIAN LOVE
IS THERE ANY WAY TO PURCHASE A VERSION OF THIS GAME THAT STILL SENDS REVENUE TO GOAT WOLF AND CABBAGE

LOVE THE MECHANICS HAVE PRINTED AND PLAYED TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS BUT DON'T REALLY LIKE THE THEMING AS INCLUSIVE ENOUGH TO LET ANYONE IN MY OFFICE PLAY
SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO BACKED IT ON KICKSTARTER I HAVE TO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF CHANCE TO PLAY IT I'M GLAD I DID THE ART IS BEAUTIFUL I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE WOULD STICK THE DUMB STICKERS THEY INCLUDED ALL OVER IT
EXCITED FOR AN EU RELEASE EVENTUALLY PRICE MIGHT BE A BIT HIGH BUT I STILL THINK I'LL GET IT MY GROUP LOVES THESE KINDS OF GAMES
ALREADY SOLD OUT ON AMAZON BY THE TIME THIS HIT MY FRONT PAGE
SORRY THAT WAS NOT SUPER CLEAR BECAUSE OF THE HITLER THEME I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH THAT IS RATHER NOT TAKE IT INTO THE OFFICE
I REALLY WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS GAME THAT'S COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO REALLY ENJOYS IT AND THINKS IT A SOLID GAME

SECRET FATAL FLAW IS THAT IT WILL FOREVER STAND IN THE SHADOW OF AVALON NO GAME OF THIS STYLE HAS STRIKEN THAT BALANCE BETWEEN THE DEDUCTIVE AND SOCIAL ELEMENTS QUITE LIKE AVALON I HOPE ONE DAY WE SEE A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT TO HIDDEN ROLE GAME FORMULA BUT FOR NOW SECRET HITLER IS JUST A MORE SHALLOW AVALON
ISN'T THIS A SLIGHT MODIFICATION ON THE THEME OF THE RESISTANCE
JUST GOT THE TEXT AS WELL CAME HERE TO MAKE SURE SOMEONE POSTED IT
I GOT EXCITED AFTER GETTING THE TEXT BUT I THINK IS WAY TOO STEEP RIGHT NOW I'D RATHER GET AVALON OR RESISTANCE AT THAT PRICE
SEEMS UNSAFE TO BUY FROM THEIR WEBSITE AS THEY DON'T HAVE AN SS CERTIFICATE
I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS REQUIRED SUCH A HIGH PLAYER COUNT IS IT POSSIBLE TO PLAY AT LESS THAN
THIS LOOKS COOL BUT I'LL NEVER HAVE PEOPLE AT MY TABLE MOST OF MY GAMES MAX OUT AT
THE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY PEOPLE SAID THEY SHOULD BE UP AT RETAILERS IN
IT'S NOT EVEN LISTED ON AMAZON ANYMORE SOLD OUT
SEEMS OOS ON AMAZON
WHY WOULDN'T THEY MAKE IT INTERNATIONAL FROM THE START THAT REALLY SUCKS
I WAS JUST TELLING U ABOUT THIS
LASTED LESS THAN MINUTES
IT IS UNAVAILABLE ON AMAZON RIGHT NOW

GP PRODUCT
FRIEND GOT IT IN THE KICKSTARTER PLAYED IT AND LOVED IT

WENT TO PAX AUS AND THERE WAS A KIOSK THAT HAD LIKE COPIES OF IT WAS SO EXCITED TO PICK IT UP

BUT THEY WERE SELLING IT FOR AU USD

KINDLY TOLD THEM TO GO DIE IN A HOLE WITH THE MARKUP THEY WERE ABUSING ON ITS SCARCITY
REALLY HAPPY I JUMPED ON IT AS SOON AS I SAW THIS THREAD AFTER THE NIGHTMARE THAT WAS GETTING MY HANDS ON A COPY OF SCYTHE I WASN'T GOING TO WAIT
WAIT I PLAYED THIS MONTHS AGO IN AUSTRALIA HAD NO IDEA IT WAS HARD TO GET HOLD OF WISH I'D APPRECIATED THE EXPERIENCE MORE
WHY AM I SAYING IT TO THE TUNE OF THE FUNKY PIGEON COM ADVERT
IVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS ONE FOR A WHILE DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN THEY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO SHIP TO EUROPE
EXCELLENT I WILL HAVE TO GET IT VIA IMPORT IN THE UK BUT I AM DYING TO GET HOLD OF THIS AT THE MOMENT
CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE AT LEAST ON AMAZON SOLD OUT I ASSUME
FOR A MEDIOCRE HIDDEN IDENTITY GAME IS A RIPOFF BUYING THE RESISTANCE FOR IS A MUCH BETTER DEAL
THESE CREATORS ARE GOING TO LOOK LIKE COMPLETE IDIOTS AFTER DONALD TRUMP RUNS A MODERATE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENCY THEY ARE THE SAME STYLE OF PEOPLE THAT THOUGHT OBAMA WAS A SECRET MUSLIM COMMUNIST SO RETARDED LOL
WELCOME TO THE HOBBY IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A BLAST SETTLERS OF CATAN WAS THE GAME I GREW UP PLAYING WITH MY FAMILY AND I'VE HAD MANY GOOD TIMES AND TENSE GAMES WITH IT
CONGRATS ON YOUR FIRST WITH CATAN AND BE CAREFUL WITH ALL OF THOSE WHEATS SOMEONE MIGHT ROLL A

AND SUDDENLY SOMEONE USES MONOPOLE CARD AND NO MORE WHEAT NOR WEALTH BEEN THERE SUFFERED THAT

ANYHOW CATAN IS ONE OF THE BEST GATEWAY GAMES YOU CAN HAVE
AH THE WHEAT ROOKIE MISTAKE SHEEP EMPIRE IS ALWAYS THE WAY TO GO BECAUSE BUILDING CITIES AND ROADS OUT OF SHEEP IS WAY FUNNIER TO ME I JUST PICTURE MY PEOPLE LIVING IN HOUSES MADE OUT OF LIVE SHEEP STACKED ON TOP OF AND TRAVELLING FROM PLACE TO PLACE ON THE PLUSHEST ROADS IMAGINABLE
HAVING PLAYED MOSTLY BEFORE THAT

THAT MOMENT WHERE THE SETUP PHASE TOLD ME TO DOUBLE BACK THE SELECTION OF STARTING POSITIONS WAS AN EYE OPENER HOLY SHIT THIS GAME CARES ABOUT GAME BALANCE
I PLAY MONOPOLY ON WHEAT
WELCOME TO THE HOBBY CATAN DID IT'S JOB AND BROUGHT YOU IN VERY SUCCESSFUL GATEWAY GAME GLAD YOU LIKED IT
OH YOU LUCKY PERSON I REMEMBER THE FEELING OF PLAYING CATAN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT WAS GREAT ALSO THE WEEKS AFTERWARD WERE CATAN EVERY NIGHT

I RECENTLY INTRODUCED A FRIEND TO CATAN AS WELL AND NOW I'M VERY ENVIOUS OF THAT
SETTLERS OF CATAN WAS THE GATEWAY GAME FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE THERE'S LOTS OF EVEN BETTER GAMES WAITING WHEN YOU ARE READY FOR THEM TOO ENJOY
IS CATAN EASIER THAN AGRICOLA
WELCOME TO THE HOBBY IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A BLAST SETTLERS OF CATAN WAS THE GAME I GREW UP PLAYING WITH MY FAMILY AND I'VE HAD MANY GOOD TIMES AND TENSE GAMES WITH IT
WELCOME
YOU BEST SAVOR AND ENJOY THE COUNTLESS HOURS YOU WILL BE SPEND PLAYING CATAN AS AFTER THAT IT'S JUST MORE AND MORE AND MORE OTHER AWESOME BOARD GAMES WAITING FOR YOU TO CONSUME YOUR SOUL AND WALLET AND TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN CONQUER THE WORLD WITH YOUR HIGH AND MIGHTY PLAYS

ALSO HAVE FUN
I THINK EUROS SHOULD BE PLAYED ACCORDING TO SOME OF THE BEST ADVICE I GOT FOR LEARNING GO

LOSE YOUR FIRST GAMES QUICKLY

THIS IS HOW YOU LEARN AT FIRST YOU MIGHT NOT NEED GAMES FOR AN AVERAGE EURO BUT PLAY FAST AND LOOSE FOR SEVERAL GAMES UNTIL YOU GET THE HANG OF IT THEN FEEL FREE TO SIT THERE AND GRID OUT AN OPTIMAL STRATEGY IF YOU WANT TO
EUROGAMES BEING TEDIOUS OVERWHELMING AND SLOW

FUNNY THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I FEEL ABOUT MANY AMERITRASH GAMES

MY TURN NOPE WE NEED TO FLIP THESE CARDS RESOLVE THEM IN ORDER USING THESE SPECIAL DICE THEN MOVE THE MONSTER PIECES SPACES EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF NIGHT TOKENS THAT ARE PULLED OUT OF THE GLOOM JAR OKAY NOW CAN I GO NOPE WE HAVE TO RESOLVE THE THIRD QUADRANT OF THE BOARD BECAUSE JOHN STEPPED INTO IT LAST TURN IF THE GLORMAX IS IN THE FORBIDDEN ZONE THEN WE NEED TO FLIP OVER THESE HOSTILITY CARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALLOWED TO SUMMON THE HOLY SOLDIER IN ZONE NOW CAN I GO SURE YOUR TURN I MOVE INTO THIS SPACE NOTHING HAPPENS AWESOME THEN WE MOVE THE NOTHINGNESS COUNTER FORWARD TIMES AND RELEASE THE FOOLHOUNDS WHICH DEAL YOU DAMAGE DO YOU RESPOND I HAVE A HANDGUN THAT DEALS GREAT ROLL THESE DICE AND SEE IF THE POUNDMASTER DOESN'T APPEAL TO THE DEATHJUDGE FOR A RESTRAINING ORDER
THE PROBLEM I SEE IN THIS ESPECIALLY IN EUROS WHERE PLAYERS ARE DEALING WITH NUMBERS AND OTHER SOMEWHAT CALCULABLE IS THIS EVEN A WORD ELEMENTS IS THAT EVERYONE IN THE TABLE MUST SUBSCRIBE TO THE SAME IDEA IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK IF JERRY FROM ACCOUNTING TAKES MINS THINKING OVER HIS MOVE I SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T PLAY FROM THE GUT BECAUSE CHANCES ARE GOOD THAT HE WOULD WIN SIMPLY BY THINKING THROUGH HIS MOVES BETTER
I DON'T DISLIKE EURO BOARD GAMES BUT GOD DAMN IF I DON'T HATE PLAYING EURO BOARD GAMES YOU'VE HAD FOUR OTHER PLAYERS TURNS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO VERY RARELY DOES THE BOARD STATE CHANGE SO MUCH THAT YOU NEED MORE TIME THAN EVERYONE ELSE COMBINED TO FIGURE OUT YOUR TURN I'M NOT PLAYING PLAYING BECAUSE I WANT AN INTENSE CONTEST OF WIT AND STRATEGY SOME PEOPLE WANT THAT AND THAT'S FINE PEOPLE CAN ENJOY DIFFERENT THINGS

BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW UPFRONT THAT I AM HAPPY TO SKIP A GAME AND JUST WATCH HOW IT PLAYS OUT BECAUSE EITHER THE GAME ENCOURAGES AP OR THE PLAYERS THEMSELVES TEND TOWARDS AP THAT SHIT IS EXHAUSTING
SIX SIDED TURN TIMER IS THE BEST BOARD GAME INVESTMENT MAKES FOR A LITTLE LESS SCREAMING OF JUST GO
I PLAYED WITH ONE GUY WHO WOULD EVEN SAY THINGS ALONG THE LINES OF HOLD ON I HAVE TO REEVALUATE THE WHOLE BOARD STATE AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE HIS TURN BECAUSE ANOTHER PLAYER CHANGED THE STATE OF THE GAME A BIT MUCH FOR HIM HATED PLAYING WITH HIM BUT NEVER SAID IT
I HAVE GIVEN THE FOLLOWING ADVICE FOR FIVE TRIBES DON'T SINK TIME INTO LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT MOVE LOOK FOR A GOOD MOVE THEN DO THAT IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT FIVE TRIBES REWARDS THE PLAYER FOR TAKING LONG TURNS AND THE DESIGN ITSELF IS PARTIALLY TO BLAME BUT THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE A SLOW PLAYER FOR BEING INCONSIDERATE OF EVERYONE TIME

ALSO I'M SORRY YOUR INTRODUCTION TO FRESCO WENT BADLY OP UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES IT REALLY IS A LOVELY GAME
I FIND THAT BOARD GAMES IN GENERAL ARE A LOT MORE ENJOYABLE IF YOU DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE JUST TRY TO ENJOY THE PROCESS OF PLAYING FROM TURN TO TURN IF YOU WIN IT'S A NICE BONUS BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE ESSENTIAL TO YOUR EXPERIENCE OF THE GAME
IT'S CRAZY HOW LONG THE MODERN VERSION OF THE BOARD GAMING HOBBY HAS EXISTED WITHOUT GAME CLOCKS BECOMING NORMAL LIFESTYLE GAME PLAYERS DON'T USE THEM ONLY FOR TOURNAMENTS WE USE THEM ALL THE TIME TO KEEP THE GAME GOING EVEN PLAYING IN A BAR ON A PLANE OR WHATEVER IT DOESN'T PREVENT SOCIALIZING EITHER
I PLAY EUROS PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY AND I DON'T GET YOUR POINT AT ALL
I HEARD ONCE POSSIBLY FROM A TIM FERRISS PODCAST THAT DECISION MAKING IS A SKILL AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET BETTER AT IT IS TO PRACTICE IT BY AGONIZING AND BEING HESITANT TO MAKE A DECISION YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY BETTER EFFECTIVE DECISION MAKING IS MADE QUICKLY WITH THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU AT THAT TIME THERE IS NO PERFECT DECISION

AS GENERAL PATTON SAID
A GOOD SOLUTION APPLIED WITH VIGOR NOW IS BETTER THAN A PERFECT SOLUTION APPLIED TEN MINUTES LATER

THESE TWO PHILOSOPHIES THAT I TRY TO CARRY INTO GAME PLAY WITH ME I TRY TO MAKE DECISIONS BEFORE MY TURN ROLLS AROUND WITH CONTINGENCIES FOR WHAT I'LL DO IF MY FIRST OPTION BECOMES UNAVAILABLE THIS MEANS WHEN IT IS MY TURN I CAN USUALLY EXECUTE QUITE QUICKLY

DO I USUALLY WIN NUMBER
DO I OFTEN REALISE JUST AFTER I TAKE MY TURN THAT I MADE A SUBOPTIMAL MOVE YEP
DO I SOMETIMES TAKE LONGER TO MAKE DECISIONS YEP THOUGH IT'S THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE
DO I ENJOY MOST GAME EXPERIENCES YEP

I ALWAYS SAY DON'T TRY TOO HARD TO WIN YOUR FIRST GAMES YOU WILL JUST LOSE AFTER A LONGER TIME THAT IT SHOULD NOTHING MAKE SENSE FOR NOW TRY IT LEARN IT ENJOY IT

FROM ANOTHER THREAD
DON'T BE I'M CONFUSED BUT MORE I KNOW THERE ARE THINGS I CAN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND ABOUT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO BUT I'LL DO IT ANYWAY
IF THIS IS A PROBLEM THEN START A TIMER ON YOUR PHONE I HAD AN ISSUE WITH SOMEONE TAKING VERY LONG TURNS MINUTES SO AFTER A WHILE WHEN THEY STARTED BUMMING AND AAHING I TURNED THE TIMER ON AND SAID YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE FUCKING BUY SOMETHING THE TURNS BECAME A LOT QUICKER AFTER THAT
OR I CAN PLAY A GAME THAT DOESN'T FORCE ME INTO MAKING RUSHED SUBOPTIMAL DECISIONS
IF YOU DON'T TRY TO OPTIMIZE YOUR MOVES AND ACTIONS YOU SHOULDN'T PLAY EURO GAMES
THAT IS WHAT THESE GAMES ARE ALL ABOUT YOU GETTING THE BEST RESULT WITH THE RESOURCES AND SITUATIONS YOU FACE WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN BY DOING THE BEST POSSIBLE MOVES PLAYERS SHOULDN'T TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES ON EVERY TURN BUT SOMETIMES IT IS NEEDED ESPECIALLY IN THE END PHASE

DISCUSSION
EARLY IN THE MONTH I WENT TO A LOCAL CON AND GOT TO PLAY A NUMBER OF NEW GAMES BUT NONE THAT I OWNED WITH THANKSGIVING OUR MONTHLY GAMING GROUP DIDN'T MEET SO I WASN'T ABLE TO GET ANYTHING NEW TO THE TABLE ON THE UPSIDE OVER THE CHRISTMAS BREAK WE'RE ALREADY PLANNING ONE ALL DAY GAME DAY AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME GAMES IN WITH FAMILY AS WELL
A GAME ABOUT PIZZA OH GOOD LORD THAT'S SUPER TEMPTING
I AGREE I WOULD FIND THIS QUITE HELPFUL

AS PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED I KNOW THAT PLAY TIMES VARY WIDELY BASED ON THE GROUP BUT HEY SO DO OUR RATINGS OF A GAME AND I STILL FIND THAT RATING ON BG USEFUL ONE DOESN'T TAKE IT AS GOSPEL JUST AS A GENERAL AVERAGE ONE FACTOR YOU CAN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AMONG MANY OTHERS

WHAT I FIND REALLY HELPFUL IS SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT PLAY TIME LIKE WHETHER TURNS ARE LIKELY TO PROVOKE AP OR IF IT'S ONE OF THOSE GAMES WHERE YOU ADD PER PLAYER OR IF THE PLAY TIME IS MUCH SHORTER WHEN YOU PLAY IT SOLO THE KIND OF THING THAT I USUALLY HAVE TO COMB REVIEWS FOR I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS KIND OF INFORMATION COULD BE REPRESENTED IN A SINGLE NUMBER ON BG REALLY BUT I'M JUST INDULGING IN SOME WISHFUL THINKING HERE
THE IDEAL THING WOULD BE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF CALCULATED PERSONAL PLAYTIME FOR EVERY GAME

A RATIO THING WHERE YOU PUT YOUR PLAYTIME FOR EVERY GAME AND BASED ON THAT IT WILL USE USER DATA COMPARE SIMILARLY TIMED USERS
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG THE PLAYTIME IS FOR CAVERN
SO IF YOU TAKE 2 HOURS TO PLAY AGRICOLA IT LOOKS AT SAM WHO HAS PLAYED AGRICOLA WITH A 2 HOUR PLAYTIME AS WELL AND THEN SEES SAM TOOK HOURS TO PLAY CAVERN USING THIS INFO IT WILL DYNAMICALLY DISPLAY A HOUR PLAYTIME FOR YOU
OF COURSE IT WOULDN'T USE JUST ONE USER'S DATA BUT MULTIPLE USERS WITH SIMILAR PLAYTIMES FOR GAMES AND AVERAGE IT OUT
I'D LIKE A FEATURE THAT TELLS YOU HOW PLAYER COUNT AFFECTS PLAY TIME CARCASSONNE IS A FLAT MINUTES REGARDLESS OF PLAYER COUNT CYCLADES IS MIN PER PLAYER AND POWER GRID IS A PROPORTIONAL MIN PER PLAYER BUT THE LISTED PLAY TIMES DON'T TELL ME THE DIFFERENCE
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE HERE IS SO FOCUSED ON VARIATION

EVERYTHING IN THE VOTEABLE THINGS ARE VARIED THE IDEA IS THAT OVER SEVERAL HUNDRED VOTES THE AVERAGE WILL GIVE YOU SOME KIND OF INDICATION

THE BOX TIME IS PUBLIC INFORMATION WHERE'S THE HARM IN JUST INCLUDING A USER VOTE AS WELL IT'S JUST A BIT OF EXTRA INFORMATION USE IT DON'T USE IT I STILL THINK IT'D BE USEFUL TO KNOW THAT ON AVERAGE PEOPLE RATE A GAME AS TAKING TWO HOURS INSTEAD OF ONE HOUR

SURE THERE'S VARIABLES BUT WHEN THAT COMES OUT AS THE AVERAGE IT MEANS IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE LONGER THAN YOU MAY EXPECT
I LOG MY PLAYS AND THEIR DURATIONS ON BG THAT INFO HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE

BASICALLY I'M SAYING THAT I'M DOING MY PART ALL ALL NEED TO HOLD UP YOUR END
IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER NOT TO COMPUTE JUST THE BUT
IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE IT WOULD BE SKEWED BY THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY GAMES AND CHAT AT THE SAME TIME OR DO IT WHILE WATCHING TV OR THOSE WHO ARE EITHER JUST REALLY REALLY FAST OR WHO PUT LOW TIMES IN BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS SOME REFLECTION OF INTELLIGENCE OR SKILL BETTER JUST TO TAKE THE BOX FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH
BECAUSE THE TIMES ARE STILL GOING TO BE SKEWED IF A BOX SAYS MINUTES THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME PEOPLE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME IN MINUTES AND IT MAY TAKE SOME PEOPLE MINUTES EITHER WAY YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE A WIDE RANGE FOR THE TIME FRAME DEPENDING ON THE GROUP

WHAT IF YOU ONLY HAVE EXTREMELY FAST SKILLED PLAYERS REPORTING THAT THE AVERAGE TIME A GAME TAKES IS HOURS EVEN THOUGH THE BOX SAYS BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT YOUR GROUP TAKES HOURS TO PLAY THE GAME BECAUSE YOU AREN'T AS GOOD AS THE SKILLED PLAYERS WHO ARE REPORTING THE SHORTER TIME THE ESTIMATE WOULDN'T HAVE HELPED YOU AT ALL

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE TIME ESTIMATES GIVEN ON THE BOXES
NO JOKE MY FRIENDS PLAYED A HOUR GAME OF IMPERIAL SETTERS BECAUSE NO ONE READ THE RULES AND EVERYONE WAS ON THEIR PHONES SOUNDED LIKE A TERRIBLE TIME
BECAUSE ALMOST EVERY GROUP PLAYS AT DIFFERENCE SPEEDS BASED ON NUMEROUS FACTORS EXPERIENCE INDIVIDUAL AP SOCIALISING DISTRACTIONS ETC
HOW DO THEY GET THEIR PLAY TIMES

I KNOW THAT WHEN YOU'RE LOGGING A GAME YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR PLAY TIME AND I JUST ASSUMED THAT THOSE STATS CAME FROM THE AVERAGE THAT PEOPLE LOG FOR THEIR GAMES
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE IT THE PAGE COULD SHOW THE ESTIMATE SUGGESTED PLAYING TIME AND THE RESULTS OF VOTING SIMILAR TO HOW THEY'RE ALREADY SHOWING THE PLAYER COUNTS SUPPORTS AND WORKS BEST WITH

I THINK MANY ARE INTENTIONALLY PUTTING TOO OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES ON HEAVIER GAMES AS MANY PLAYERS WOULD FEEL HOURS PLAYING TIME OFF-PUTTING MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS COULD BE AVOIDED IF THERE WOULD BE MORE REALISTIC ESTIMATES AVAILABLE AT LEAST I HAVE BOUGHT A COUPLE OF GAMES WHERE THE SUGGESTED PLAYING TIME WAS ALREADY ON THE LONGER SIDE AND THE REAL PLAYING TIME WAS EVEN LONGER FURY OF DRACULA FOR EXAMPLE THOSE GAMES RARELY GET PLAYED SO I PROBABLY NOT BOUGHT THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE HAD I KNOW THE REAL PLAYING TIME

TELLING ME WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG OR WE SHOULD TALK LESS IS NOT THE SOLUTION FOR ME HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH MY FRIENDS IS AS IMPORTANT AS PLAYING THE ACTUAL GAME AND IF THE GAME IS BUILT AROUND NEGOTIATION STORY DISCUSSION OR ANYTHING THAT ENCOURAGES TALKING IT SHOULD BE COUNTED IN THE ESTIMATE ONLY WAY WE CAN COMPLETE ELDRITCH HORROR IN THE SUGGESTED PLAYING TIME IS BY NOT READING THE ENCOUNTER TEXTS AND SIMPLY ROLLING THE DICE AND SEEING THE RESULTS
I'VE DISCOVERED THAT MY GROUP TENDS TO PLAY GAMES FASTER SINCE I WAS SHOCKED THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT PLAYING PLAYER GAMES OF CATAN IN MINUTES NORMALLY AND THAT INCLUDES CHATTING ABOUT LIFE DURING THE GAME
I'VE FOUND THAT IF YOU HAVE A GROUP WHERE EVERYONE HAS PLAYED THE GAME MULTIPLE TIME ANALYSIS PARALYSIS IS AVOIDED AND THERE AREN'T DISTRACTION YOU CAN COME CLOSE TO THE BOX PLAYTIME EVEN ON MONSTER GAMES UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS RARELY THE CASE
I USUALLY DOUBLE THE BOX TIME AT THE END OF THE GAME I LOOK AT MY FRIENDS WITH DISBELIEF AND SAY THIS IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE MINUTES
AWESOME QUESTION

ESPECIALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHEN BEST AT PLAYER COUNT EXISTS
I DON'T THINK IT'D BE ANY MORE ACCURATE REALLY WITH HOW VARIED THINGS ARE DEPENDING ENTIRELY ON YOUR GROUP AND AFTER THE FIRST FEW PLAYTHOUGHS I FIND BOX TIMES TO BE EITHER ACCURATE OR EXAGGERATED
CONVOY
WOULD YOU PUT YOUR BRAIN INTO A ROBOT BODY
CHECK OUT MACHS VS MINIONS
REALLY MAKES THIS GAME SOUND FUN GREAT REVIEW I'D LOVE TO PLAY IT SOON BUT I'M NOT SURE I'M GOING TO RUSH OUT TO GRAB IT TECHNO BOWL ALSO HAS THE RISK OF FAILURE ON EVERY ACTION THOUGH IT USES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ROLL MECHANIC IT'S POWERED BY THE APOCALYPSE ESSENTIALLY FOR ANY RPG PLAYERS OUT THERE I WOULD LOVE TO COMPARE THE TWO AND SEE HOW THEY STACK UP
WHOLE LOTTA TIME JUST DESCRIBING WHAT MINIATURES ARE WHAT THE BOX SMELLS LIKE WHAT ASSEMBLING MINIATURES INVOLVES
SO THIS IS OFF THE CUFF BUT FROM A WRITING STAND POINT I THINK YOU MAY BE DEDICATING A BIT TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE CORPORATION BASED ON THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME YOU'VE GIVEN US

THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO ESCAPE THE CAVE SO THAT SHOULD BE YOUR DRIVING NARRATIVE YOUR CORPORATION AT LEAST AS FAR AS YOU'VE REVEALED IS ULTIMATELY IRRELEVANT IT COULD BE ANYBODY IN FACT SIMPLY HAVING THE CORPORATION BE NAMELESS FACELESS IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT IT YOU WANT TO HUMANIZE YOUR CHARACTERS PLAYERS AND CASTING YOUR CORPORATION AS AN UNCARING MAY BE THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE A SENSE OF FEAR DREAD AS YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY EMPHASIZING THAT YOUR EMPLOYER ISN'T CONCERNED WITH YOUR WELL-BEING

ONE WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS WOULD BE TO MIRROR WHAT THEY DO ON R SCP SHOOT FOR THAT COLD DETACHED APPROACH THAT THE CPS USE WHEN DESCRIBING THEIR EMPLOYEES
THE FLASHLIGHT BATTERY THING IS A TIRED TROPE IN REAL LIFE A GOOD FLASHLIGHT GOES ON FOR DAYS AND YOU CAN TAKE EXTRA BATTERIES MAYBE MAKE SOMETHING ELSE THE CAUSE OF THE TIME LIMIT LIKE FOOD OR OXYGEN OR SOMETHING
THE DIFFICULTY IS HOW TO DESIGN THE CORPORATION SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST A REHASH OF OR ANY OF THE OTHER TROPES AROUND

MAKE THEM INTELLIGENT TO WIT

HAVE TO ESCAPE BEFORE THEIR FLASHLIGHTS RUN OUT OF BATTERY

PROFESSIONALS COST MORE MONEY THAN BATTERIES CORPORATIONS DOING THE WHOLE MWAHAHAHAHA THING IN FICTION ARE LESS EVIL THAN CORPORATIONS THAT EXIST TODAY WHICH RUTHLESSLY USE EXPERTISE TO EXPLOIT PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS TO THEIR FULLEST NEVER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND MAKE MONEY AT THE COST OF ANYONE BUT THEMSELVES
WELL THIS MAY TOTALLY NOT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT TO REFERENCE AND NOT DIRECTLY REVEALING WHO THEY ARE REMIND ME OF THE TV SERIES OF MR ROBOT WHERE THE MAIN CHARACTER TALKS ABOUT HIS FIRM AS EVIL CORP LITERACY WHERE IN FACT THEY ARE NAME OF THE COMPANY IS YOU COULD USE AN ALIAS OR A DAUGHTER COMPANY NAME AND REVEAL THE MAIN COMPANY AT A LATER TIME

YOU COULD ALSO CREATE A UNIVERSE WITH MULTIPLE BIG CORPORATIONS NETRUNNER LIKE AND USE DAUGHTER COMPANIES TO ACT UNDER THEIR BEHALF WITHOUT REVEAL WHO THEY WORK FOR
AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THE FLASHLIGHT THING IS A LITTLE WEAK DO SOME RESEARCH AND FIND OUT WHAT KINDS OF DANGERS ACTUALLY EXIST IN CAVES AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME WHILE THEY'RE EXPLORING SOME EVENT TRIGGERS ONE OR MORE OF THESE THINGS

IF THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS EXPLORING AN UNCHARTED AREA THEY'LL HAVE SOME DETECTION EQUIPMENT SOME OF WHICH WILL BE USED TO DETECT NOXIOUS GASES THAT LIKE TO GATHER IN CAVES THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE OXYGEN IN CASE THEY FIND SOME OF THOSE GASES



MAKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOUR LIMITER IF THEY RUN OUT OF OXYGEN THEY HAVE SOME AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET OUT BEFORE THE GASES KILL THEM PROLONGED EXPOSURE SHOULD HAVE SOME NEGATIVE EFFECT

YOUR CORPORATION ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT AND DOESN'T NEED FLESHED OUT TOO FAR IN ORDER TO MAKE THE PLOT ENGAGING MOST LIKELY THE EXPLORERS WILL FIND SOMETHING THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT SUPPOSED TO FIND MAYBE WHATEVER IT IS BELONGS TO ANOTHER CORPORATION IT'S ALIEN IT'S MAGIC IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO EXIST WHATEVER

ULTIMATELY IT DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT THE GAMEPLAY SINCE THE CORPORATION ISN'T ACTUALLY PLAYING UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAVE IT BE A DEAD OF WINTER OR BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL WHERE ONE OF THE PLAYERS IS AN AGENT OF THE COMPANY EVEN THEN THE FLAVOR ISN'T REALLY THAT IMPORTANT COMPANY WANTS SOMETHING EXPLORERS FIND SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T EXPECT THEY DON'T KNOW WHO'S ACTUALLY IN CHARGE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL THAT'S NEEDED
TRAINS IS A LOT OF FUN YOU'RE BUILDING A DECK AS WELL AS A TRAIN NETWORK ON THE BOARD
WHILE I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT CLANK IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR

REVIEWS HAVE BEEN SOLID FOR IT AND THE THEME IS SUPER COOL YOU PLAY AS THIEVES TRYING TO STEAL TREASURE FROM A DRAGON'S LAIR IT HAS A DUNGEON CRAWLING VIBE WITH PUSH YOUR LUCK AND DECK BUILDING MECHANICS
CONCORDIA
LEWIS CLARK
YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT END IF YOU LIKE CO-OP GAMES
I HAVE NOT A FAN OF PURE DECK BUILDERS AS I FIND THE MECHANIC ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME WITH THAT IN MIND THOUGH GAMES WITH DECK BAG BUILDING WOVEN IN WITH OTHER GREAT MECHANICS INCLUDE

GREAT WESTERN TRAIL

ROCOCO

MOMBASA

ORLEANS
FOR THE CROWN IS DECKBUILDING WITH CHESS SALMON RUN IS A LIGHT DECKBUILDING AND RACING GAME YOU SHOULD ALSO LOOK AT BATTALIA THE CREATION
HAVE YOU PLAYED ANY OF MARTIN DECK BUILDING GAMES IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU COULD REALLY BE INTO A FEW ACRES OF SNOW OR A STUDY IN EMERALD
HAVEN'T PLAYED THROUGH A FULL GAME YET BUT VIKINGS GONE WILD IS REALLY COOL YOU CAN PLAY ON TABLETOPIA AND THE KICKSTARTER STARTS SHIPPING NEXT YEAR SPRING I THINK

IT'S A WORKER PLACEMENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT GAME WITH A DECK BUILDING MECHANIC AT ITS CORE I HOPE IT MAKES A SPLASH WHEN IT HITS NEXT YEAR
CLANK SEEMS LIKE IS SOMETHING YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IT'S A DECK BUILDING GAME THAT RESOLVES AROUND THE IDEA OF EXPLORING A CAVE MAP USING THE DECK YOU BUILDING AVOID TRAP BREAK INTO ROOM GET THAT LOOT AND GETTING OUT BEFORE THE DRAGON WAKES UP AND EAT YOU ALIVE THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THAT THE COMBAT PART MIGHT BE A LITTLE WEAK SINCE IT'S NOT THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE GAME BUT OTHERWISE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL DEFINITELY BE INTERESTED IN
YO AWG I HEARD YOU LIKE DECK BUILDING SO I PUT SOME DECK BUILDING IN YOUR DECK BUILDING GAME

DECK BUILDING THE DECK BUILDING GAME
IF YOU WANT HARDCORE CLUE TRY ALCHEMISTS

ITS LIKE YOURE PLAYING 2 MEDIUM WEIGHT GAMES AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THEM BEING CLUE
LADY ALICE OR MYSTERY OF THE ABBEY

MYSTERIUM ISN'T REALLY LIKE CLUE THERE IS NO DEDUCTION AND IT'S COOPERATIVE
MYSTERY OF THE ABBEY IS THE MOST POPULAR CHOICE FOR A MODERN CLUE IT GETS RID OF THE ADDS A LITTLE BIT OF VARIABLE POWERS VIA CARDS AND SPEEDS ITSELF UP THERE'S ALSO MYSTERY EXPRESS AS ANOTHER DEDUCTION GAME IN THE SAME SORT OF GAME LINE ALTHOUGH IT'S QUITE A BIT RARER THAN ABBEY MAKING IT FOR A COPY
BAKER STREET IS PRETTY CLOSE YOU TRAVEL AROUND THE BOARD PIECING TOGETHER CLUES TO SOLVE A MURDER
PERFECT ALIBI AND SLEUTH ARE BOTH LOGIC PUZZLES LIKE CLUE BUT HARDER PERFECT ALIBI ALSO INTRODUCES SOME PLAYER POWERS THAT CAN BE CHANGED AROUND IN THE COURSE OF THE GAME

IMO MYSTERIUM AND KILL DOCTOR LUCKY WOULD ONLY BE SIMILAR TO CLUE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE THEME NOT THE MECHANICS
KILL DOCTOR LUCKY IS KIND OF LIKE THE INVERSE OF CLUE

YOU ARE THE MURDERER YOU MUST COLLECT WEAPONS AND SNEAK UP ON DOCTOR LUCKY AND WHEN NOBODY ELSE CAN SEE YOU YOU MUST KILL HIM

IT'S LIKE THE THIRTY MINUTES IMMEDIATELY BEFORE CLUE
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SOLVE A MURDER OR THE CLOSEST THING TRY SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE
I RECENTLY PLAYED A GAME CALLED KILL DOCTOR LUCKY IT IS A REVERSE CLUE WHERE YOU HAVE TO KILL DOCTOR LUCKY IN A SECLUDED ROOM WITH WHATEVER WEAPONS YOU GET I REALLY ENJOYED IT AND IT DEFINITELY REMINDED ME OF CLUE
MYSTERY OF THE ABBEY IS MY FAVORITE GAME IN THIS CATEGORY
ONE OF NEW EXCLUSIVE GAMES IS CALLED SUSPICION YOU CAN GET IT REALLY CHEAP AND IT'S QUITE FUN
CLUE THE GREAT MUSEUM CAPER

U GETINFO
MYSTERIUM IS LIKE CLUE WITH DREAMS
CLUED
CLUED
THERE ARE GREAT IOS ANDROID APPS FOR CARCASSONNE AND PATCHWORK

HIVE POCKET IS VERY PORTABLE AND COULD BE PLAYED ON AN AIRPLANE TRAY TABLE I HAVEN'T TRIED IT BUT IN THE MUSD REVIEW OF ARBORETUM THEY MENTION PLAYING THAT ON A PLANE YOU JUST NEED TO SCRUNCH THE CARDS TOGETHER A BIT TO ONLY SHOW SUIT AND NUMBER
TRAVEL SETTLERS

CARCASSONNE OR LE HAVRE ON A TABLET

ALSO PUERTO RICO OR RA BUT I FIND THE COMPUTER PLAYERS VERY WEAK

M TG FITS ON NORMAL PLANE TABLES

EPIC SADLY DOESN'T ALTHOUGH THAT'S A MUCH BETTER GAME FOR TWO


I'VE HAD QUITE A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH FUNGI ALSO KNOWN AS MORELS SHORT BUT TENSE GAMES WITH VERY EASY AND COMPACT SETUP
HIVE POCKET AND STAR REALMS ARE OUR TRAIN PLANE GAMES OF CHOICE

BIBLIOG I THINK IT REALLY WORKS THE BEST AT 2
I WOULD GO WITH AN APP FOR SPLENDOR OR TICKET TO RIDE BUT IF YOU ARE SET ON A PHYSICAL GAME THEN HIVE POCKET HANAFI OR A PLAIN DECK OF CARDS ARE PROBABLY YOUR BEST BETS
IT'S OLD SCHOOL BUT NOTHING BEATS THE OLD SCHOOL GAMES FOR TRAVEL VERSIONS TINY MAGNETIC AND SUPER CHEAP MY DAD AND I ALSO USED TO PLAY A LOT OF CRIBBAGE ON PLANES
LOVE LETTER
COUP
THE NEUROSHIMA HEX APPARENTLY IT'S GOT EVERYTHING THE BASE GAME HAS BUT REMOVES THE FINICKY PART OF HAVING TO RESOLVE COMBAT YOURSELF

BASE GAME COMES WITH ARMIES WITH THE OPTION TO BUY MORE
IF YOU ARE ON BUDGET WHAT I JUST BOUGHT IS A SIMPLE POLARVIDE BLANKET FROM IKEA AND STRETCHED IT OVER A TABLE DIDN T HAVE THE CHANCE TO ACTUALLY PLAY ANYTHING ON IT BUT I TESTED CARDS PICKING AND DICE ROLLING AND WORKS PRETTY WELL FOR SOMETHING THAT COSTS
IN EVERY THREAD THAT SHOWS HOW TO MAKE OR WHERE TO BUY SOME COOL ACCESSORY SOMEONE ALWAYS COMES IN AND TALKS ABOUT HOW IT'S SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY AND HOW THEY COULD DO IT FOR WAY CHEAPER I'VE GOT BIG NEWS IT'S NOT A WASTE OF MONEY FOR EVERYONE

A NICE QUALITY TABLE COVERING NOT A TABLE CLOTH OR SOME DIY PROJECT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN NEEDING AND IS NO BIG DEAL FOR SUCH A PRODUCT I WONDER IF THEY'D BE ABLE TO CUSTOM CUT IT SO I JUST SENT THEM AN EMAIL

THANKS VERY MUCH FOR SHARING
I PURCHASED A MM NYLON MESH NEOPRENE SHEET FROM LAST YEAR VERY SATISFIED IN FACT I JUST UPGRADED THE SIZE OF MY DINING GAMING TABLE SO I WILL BE SENDING BUSINESS THEIR WAY AGAIN FOR ANOTHER ONE
HELL I WENT TO MY LOCAL FABRIC STORE BOUGHT A FEW YARDS OF FELT FOR AROUND PER YARD AND MADE A TABLE COVER THAT WOULD FIT SNUG OVER THE TABLE NOW I'VE GOT A SURFACE THAT LETS PIECES SLIDE SMOOTHLY AND ALLOWS FOR PICKING UP CARDS AND SLIDING THEM UNDER OTHERS WITHOUT NEEDING TO PICK THEM UP ALL FOR LESS THAN
YOU CAN BUY SPEED FELT FABRIC TO MAKE YOUR OWN SUPER DURABLE QUALITY LOOK AND DESIGNED FOR CARDS TO SMOOTHLY SLIDE OVER BONUS OF ANY COLOR YOU WANT



SPEED FELT IS WHAT REAL POKER TABLE USE RATHER THAN THAT FLUFFY FELT FROM WALMART THAT LOOKS BAD GETS FUR BALLS


I MADE A TABLE COVER FROM A LAYER OF FELT OVER A LAYER OF CAR HEADLINER MATERIAL THE FELT IS A NICE SURFACE TO PLAY ON THE HEADLINER GIVES IT A LITTLE BOUNCE HEADLINER IS EXPENSIVE BUT THE FABRIC STORE WE GO TO FREQUENTLY HAS COUPONS FOR OFF ONE ITEM I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH I PAID FOR THE WHOLE THING BUT IT WASN'T TOO BAD I JUST USED SPRAY ADHESIVE TO GLUE THEM TOGETHER

THE FELT IS STARTING TO PILL AFTER A YEAR OR SO I MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT REPLACING IT WITH A NEOPRENE MAT
I PICKED UP A COUPLE OF QUIVER GAMING MATS HETP WHEN THEY DID THEIR FIRST KICKSTARTER A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE LOVE THEM
DIRT CHEAP TABLE CLOTH IS WHAT I WENT WITH CHECKS ALL THE BOXES
I BOUGHT A DOLLAR BLACK NYLON TABLECLOTH FROM AMAZON WORKS GREAT
I GOT MYSELF THE ULTIMATE GUARD PLAY MAT BEST DECISION EVER I EVEN TAKE IT TO MY FAGS WHEN GOING TO OPEN GAME NIGHT

EN
I ORDERED BULK MOUSEPAD MATERIAL FROM HERE

ENDED UP BEING ABOUT SHIPPING THOUGH I THINK IF YOU SHIP TO A BUSINESS SHIPPING MIGHT BE FREE I GOT 2 YARDS
THANKS FOR THE INFO

I HAVEN'T ACTIVELY TRIED LOOKING FOR A NEW TABLE COVER BUT WHAT I'VE STUMBLED UPON IS ALWAYS AND DOESN'T FIT MY AWKWARD SIZED TABLE

WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SMALL BLANKET COVERING IT STRETCHED OUT AND STAPLED UNDERNEATH AND WHILE GOOD FOR CARDS ABSOLUTELY SUCKS FOR ROLLING DICE HOPEFULLY I CAN SHOW THIS TO THE WIFE AND CONVINCE HER WE NEED THIS
I'VE GOT A POKER HOODY FROM WHICH IS REALLY NICE I GOT A COSMETICALLY IMPAIRED ONE FOR CHEAPER AND HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH IT
WHAT GAME IS ON THE MAT
I THINK I'VE SEEN YOUR REVIEW ON THIS BEFORE AND IT'S CONVINCED ME I'VE ADDED THIS TO MY CHRISTMAS LIST THANKS
DOES ANYONE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH MATS THAT ARE ONLY MM INSTEAD THE
HOW DURABLE ARE THESE I HAVE A CAT AND CAN'T WON'T KEEP HER OFF THE TABLE WHEN WE'RE NOT PLAYING GAMES
PERHAPS I MISSED IT BUT DID YOU MENTION WHICH ONLINE STORE YOU PURCHASED FROM EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED SKETCHY IT SEEMED TO WORK OUT WELL FOR YOU AND I'D BE INTERESTED TO CHECK IT OUT MYSELF
I USE A GAMING MAT FROM FRONTLINE GAMING WORKS GREAT FOR MINIATURES OR BOARD GAMES HEAVY ENOUGH THAT IT LAYS FLAT EVEN AFTER STORING ROLLED UP FOR QUITE SOME TIME
I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT AND SPACE IS TIGHT HENCE WE PLAY ON THIS COMMON WHITE FOLDING PICNIC TABLE ABOUT X

I'D WANT SOMETHING TO COVER THIS THING UP WHEN WE GAME WHAT SOLUTION WOULD YOU GUYS SUGGEST
THIS IS GREAT DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRET GETTING THE INSTEAD OF THICKNESS WITHOUT HAVING FELT IT I WOULD THINK THICKER IS BETTER EDIT NEVERMIND I JUST SAW THE YOUTUBE REVIEWER WAS NOT YOU BUT YOU THINK IS JUST FINE THEN
UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE ONES SOLD BY THE PLACE YOU MENTIONED IN THE VIDEO ONLY COME IN BLACK I'D REALLY LOVE A DIFFERENT COLOR TOP SPECIFICALLY CHARCOAL DARK GRAY HAVEN'T FOUND ANOTHER PLACE THAT SELLS THAT OPTION FOR A REASONABLE PRICE JUST YET
I PURCHASED 2 CHEAP YOGA MATS THE THINNEST ONES THEY HAVE A CUSHY TEXTURE AWESOME FOR ROLLING DICE ON SEXTILES DON'T SLIP ON THEM IT'S BEEN A REALLY AWESOME SOLUTION
I GOT IN ON THIS KICKSTARTER FOR THE SECOND GEN OF THEIR GAMING MAT IT SEEMS LIKE IT WILL BE WONDERFUL THOUGH I WON'T BE GETTING IT STILL FOR A FEW MONTHS I'M HOPING THEY SELL THIS VERSION IN RETAIL BECAUSE THERE IS A SERIOUS LACK OF GOOD GAMING SURFACES AROUND

PROJECTS
I ORDERED FROM GAMEMATZ ON FRIDAY WITH THEIR SALES



I KNOW IT'S EXPENSIVE BUT I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF A BUDGET GAMER AND I WANTED A NICE LOOKING TOPPER

I ALSO GOT THE KRAKEN VERSION

MY FRIEND WHO HAS A GLASS TABLE WENT OUT AND GOT CHEAP FELT AND GLUED A RUBBER BACK IT WORKS GOOD AND IT WAS CHEAP BUT THE EDGES CONSTANTLY CURL AND IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK THAT GOOD HOPEFULLY THEY'RE AS PREMIUM AS ADVERTISED I'M SO SICK OF PLAYING ON MY WOOD TABLE
FELT HAS WORKED GREAT FOR ME

SUPER CHEAP COSTS ME CAD FOR A X X RECTANGLE
COMES IN A VARIETY OF COLORS
EASY TO CLEAN DURABLE
LIGHT PORTABLE FOLDS UP EASILY
NO LOVE IN THIS THREAD FOR VELVET

INSTEAD OF FELT WE WENT TO A CLOTH STORE AND PURCHASED A LARGE PIECE OF VELVET I THINK WE PAID FOR IT FOR I'M ESTIMATING JUST UNDER SQUARE METERS WORTH OF FABRIC

WIDE SELECTION OF COLORS EASY TO PICK UP CARDS DICE DON'T ROLL TO INFINITY ANY MORE AND YOU CAN JUST CHUCK IT IN THE LAUNDRY TOO
I MADE MY OWN AWHILE BACK I THINK IT LOOKS NICE BUT THE DOWNSIDES ARE THAT IT'S HEAVY SO I SOMETIMES FORGET TO GET IT OUT WHEN WE HAVE GAME NIGHTS AND IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO CLEAN OTHER THAN THAT IT WORKS GREAT I THINK I'D RATHER HAVE SOMETHING LIKE WHAT YOU'RE EXPLAINING THAT COULD BE ROLLED UP AND PUT AWAY MUCH EASIER AND IS EASIER TO CLEAN I CAN'T SEE THE YOUTUBE VIDEO I'M AT WORK IS IT JUST A PIECE OF FOAM OR SOMETHING

IMAGER HETP

GAMING FELT TABLETOP COVER W O LEAF HETP
TO BE HONEST SEEMS STEEP FOR A PLAIN BLACK MATTE TABLE COVER THE ONLY REASON I SAY THIS IS THESE MATS ARE QUITE COMMON IN WARHAMMER AND WARMACHINE GAMES AND X MAT WITH A DETAILED BACKGROUND PRINTING RUNS ABOUT

MATS LIKE THIS

DELETED
I HAVE TEEN TITANS DECK BUILDER AND I LOVE IT BECAUSE OF THE THEME I JUST RECENTLY BOUGHT MAGE KNIGHT AND LOVE IT EVEN MORE THE USE OF MINIATURES REALLY COMPLEMENT THE DECK BUILDING ASPECT OF THE GAME

I DON'T REGRET MY PURCHASES AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO ADDING LEGENDARY TO MY COLLECTION BUT MY ADVICE FOR YOU IS TO SAVE FOR LEGENDARY UNLESS YOU HAVE A LOVE FOR THE DC THEME
THEY HAVE A SYSTEM CALLED THE CERBERUS ENGINE WHERE THEY THEN RETHEME THE GAME TO OTHERS LIKE STREET FIGHTER AND SUCH

IT'S A MUCH SIMPLER DECK BUILDING GAME COMPARED TO LEGENDARY I LOVE LEGENDARY ESPECIALLY WITH THE DARK CITY EXPANSION THE GAME IS GREAT AND THEMATIC AND I HAD HOURS OF FUN

WITH DC DECK BUILDING THOUGH IT'S NOT SO THEMATIC IT'S JUST A ENGINE THAT PASTE THE DC THEME ON AT LEAST IN MY OPINION IF YOU LIKE LEGENDARY YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND ONE TOO SIMPLE FOR WHAT IT IS

IF YOU CAN TRY ONCE THEN BY ALL MEANS AT LEAST PLAY ONCE BUT IF YOU ASK ME STRAIGHT UP JUST FORGET IT

HERE'S THE THING I LIKE MARVEL LEGENDARY MORE THAN DC DECK BUILDER BUT I GET WAAAAAAAAY MORE GAMES OF DC PLAYED A FEW THINGS TO NOTE

LIKE YOU SAID IT'S CHEAPER IF YOU KEEP AN EYE OUT YOU CAN GET IT FOR

2 SET UP AND TEAR DOWN IS MUCH MUCH FASTER MINUTES AND YOU ARE READY TO GO

IT SCALES WELL REGARDLESS OF PLAYER COUNT MARVEL IS TO EASY FOR 2 GOOD AT SOMETIMES DIFFICULT AT AND VERY HARD AT YOU CAN HOUSERULE TO MITIGATE BUT STILL AND OF COURSE IF YOU DO RANDOM SETUP YOU CAN END UP LOSING QUICKLY WHICH IS ESPECIALLY BRUTAL GIVEN THE SETUP TIME

GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE YOUR OWN HEROES AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A CO-OP VERSION NOW THERE IS A LOT OF VARIETY TO BE HAD

I HOPE YOU GET LEGENDARY EVENTUALLY BUT THERE IS A LOT OF FUN TO BE HAD WITH DC DECK BUILDER
LEGENDARY IS DEFINITELY THE BETTER GAME BUT SET UP AND TAKEDOWN IS HORRIFYINGLY ANNOYING DC GOT OLD QUICK FOR ME THE BEST DECK BUILDING GAME IS ASCENSION IMO
I REALLY ENJOY DECK BUILDERS BUT DC DECKBUILDER IS BY FAR MY LEAST FAVORITE OF THAT TYPE I HAVE PLAYED

WHY I DON'T LIKE IT THE GAME IS OVER SIMPLIFIED WITH THE THEME STRIPPED OUT FROM IT YEAH YOU HAVE THE PICTURE OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE CARDS BUT THEN YOU HAVE BATMAN USING HEAT VISION AND RECRUITING VILLAINS ALL IN ORDER TO CREATE A VERY DULL DECK BUILDER I LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING MORE IN MY DECK BUILDERS THAT'S WHY I'D RECOMMEND MARVEL LEGENDARY OVER IT SINCE IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE FIGHTING THE VILLAINS ON THE STREETS ALONG WITH THE CHARACTERS FEELING LIKE THEY SHOULD FEEL BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I JUST FIND MECHANICS LACKING

WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET IT NOW THAT THE SMALL RANT IS OVER DC DECKBUILDER IS GOOD IF YOU'RE PLAYING GROUP DOESN'T LIKE GAMES WITH A LOT OF RULES IN IT LEGENDARY IS SIMPLE ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT BUT THEN SOMETIMES YOU DREAD PLAYING IT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO SET IT UP ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE EXPANSIONS WHILE DC IS A QUICK SETUP PLAY AND RULES EXPLANATION IT'S WHAT I'D CONSIDER AN INTRODUCTORY GAME TO DECKBUILDING

WE LIKE PLAYING CARCASSONNE PATCHWORK PAPERBACK TICKET TO RIDE SPLENDOR AND LORDS OF WATERDEEP
SO HARD TO GET HIM OFF THE COMPUTER BUT GENERALLY JAIPUR OR CARCASSONNE
CARCASSONNE SPLENDOR AND RUN FIGHT OR DIE I'M WORKING ON IT
MOSTLY ELDRITCH HORROR
JUST FINISHED MECH VS MINIONS WITH MY SO LAST WEEK WE'RE ABOUT TO START ARCADIA QUEST CAMPAIGN THIS WEEKEND
SO FAR I'VE GOTTEN HER TO PLAY AND SHE HAS ENJOYED BOSS MONSTER BIBLIOG AND FORBIDDEN DESERT NOW WE HAVE PANDEMIC LEGACY DON'T KNOW IF SHE WILL ACTUALLY LIKE IT BUT SHE PROMISED TO PLAY THE WHOLE SEASON WITH ME
MINE WILL TRY ALMOST ANYTHING BUT SHE REALLY PREFERS EUROS AND SHE SEEMS TO LIKE QUITE A BIT EXCEPT FOR PANDEMIC SHE DOESN'T LIKE PANDEMIC

I BELIEVE HER CURRENT FAVORITES ARE FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE AND GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL BUT I'M GUESSING THAT'S BECAUSE SHE HASN'T HAD THE TIME TO SIT DOWN AND LEARN A FEAST FOR ODIN SHE'S GOING TO LOVE IT


RIGHT NOW SHE'S ON AN ISTANBUL KICK BUT SHE ALSO LIKES SO MANY OTHER GAMES WE CAN PRETTY MUCH PLAY A DIFFERENT GAME OR TWO EVERY EVENING
WE PLAY PATCHWORK STAR REALMS TINY EPIC GALAXIES PANDEMIC REIGN OF CTHULHU HIVE POCKET GAME OF TRAINS THE GRIZZLED
SEASONS MARKHAM HORROR MANSIONS OF MADNESS QUARRIERS ANYTHING REALLY ALTHOUGH SHE PREFERS THEMATIC AND COOP GAMES OVER EURO COMPETITIVE SEASONS GETS A PASS DUE TO THE AWESOME ART
WE LIKE WONDERS DUEL AGRICOLA ABAS PANDEMIC AND EVOLUTION
PATCHWORK

COTTAGE GARDEN

AGRICOLA

WONDERS DUEL

TICKET TO RIDE

BIBLIOG
MARKHAM HORROR MOSTLY HE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE ANYTHING ELSE THOUGH THERE IS THE OCCASIONAL CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AND WE HAVE READ THROUGH A COUPLE OF THE SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE SERIES
LATELY WE'VE BEEN ON A CARD GAME KICK SO DIMMET JAIPUR AND ARBORETUM
SHE MOSTLY ONLY WANTS TO PLAY CARCASSONNE SOMETIMES JAIPUR SHE HATED WONDERS DUEL BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY STUFF COSTING MORE BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE PRODUCES IT
OUR MOST PLAYED GAMES AS A COUPLE ARE LEGENDARY MARVEL SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE FORBIDDEN DESERT LOST CITIES AND WONDERS DUEL HAS BEEN A RECENT ADDITION
SEKIGAHARA

AGRICOLA

AND THEN WE HELD HANDS

BARONY



PATCHWORK

SPLENDOR
I BOUGHT IT I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE CRAP OUT OF IT BUT MY SITUATIONS HAVE LENT IT TO BE EXTREMELY DESIRED IN MY CIRCLES

ITS MAGIC THE GATHERING FOR BOARDGAMERS

THE GAME COMES WITH CARDS EACH ONE UNIQUE THE CARDS ARE DUAL SIDED ONE EVIL SIDE AND ONE GOOD SIDE IN THE GAME THE CARDS ARE YOUR MONSTERS CALLED WARRIORS YOUR LANDS CALLED RESOURCES AND YOUR SPELLS CALLED ORDERS YOU GET CARDS TO A DECK THE WAY MOST OF THE RESOURCES WORK IS BY PHASING THEM AKA FLIPPING THEM OVER TO THEIR OTHER SIDE YOU CAN DO THIS INFINITELY BUT EVENTUALLY YOU WILL WANT TO CAST SOMETHING THAT WILL LOCK THEM CANNOT PHASE UNTIL YOUR NEXT TURN

COMBAT IS ALL AROUND ATTACKING A CENTRAL POOL OF POINTS THE POINTS ARE HALF GOOD POINTS AND HALF EVIL SUCCESSFULLY HITTING THIS POOL GETS YOU POINTS OF THE TYPE THAT YOU ATTACK WITH WHEN ONE TYPE IS COMPLETELY DRAINED FROM THE POOL THE GAME ENDS THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST OF TYPE GOOD OR EVIL WINS THE CATCH IS THAT YOU CAN ONLY BLOCK ATTACKS WITH THE OPPOSING FACTION GOOD OR EVIL

IT IS VERY COMBO HEAVY WITH A LOT OF INTERRUPTS AND SPELL CASTING YOU ARE NEVER RESTRICTED IN OPTIONS JUST IN RESOURCES GAMES CAN LAST TURNS OR TURNS BUT I NEVER FEEL LIKE THEY LAST TOO LONG ITS EITHER SUPER CLOSE OR A LUCKY BLOWOUT IT ALSO PLAYS UP TO PLAYERS SIMULTANEOUSLY OR YOU HAVE ENOUGH CARDS TO PLAY A FEW GAMES AT THE SAME TIME

THE PLACE THIS GAME SHINES IS THE DECK BUILDING BEFORE PLAYING IN THE MANUAL THERE IS A LIST OF ALL THE CARDS COMBOS BACK AND FRONT THE FACES REPEAT BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE GOOD WITH BAD ON THE BACK AND ALSO GOOD WITH A BAD 2 ON THE BACK ITS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO CREATE COMBO TRAINS TO GIVE YOU ADVANTAGE WE SPEND MORE TIME BUILDING THE DECKS THAN PLAYING ITS REALLY FUN IF YOU LIKE TRYING TO CREATE CRAZY COMBOS YOU CAN ALSO PRINT YOUR OWN COMBOS ON AND THERE SHOULD BE EPACTS COMING AS WELL

TL R I REALLY LIKE IT IT IS VERY CEREBRAL THINK MAGIC MEETS THE DUKE IF YOU LIKE MAGIC BUT DON'T WANT TO BUY CARDS FOREVER I RECOMMEND IT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET A FRIEND INTO MAGIC GET IT FOR THEM

FEEL FREE TO ASK ME ANY QUESTIONS I WILL RESPOND AS LONG AS I AM ON TONIGHT I HAVE PROBABLY HOURS PLAYING AND BUILDING DECKS
LOTS OF UPVOTES AND NO RESPONSES IS MAKING IT SEEM LIKE MANY FOLKS JUST GAVE UP ON BLACK BOX
HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WILL CHIME IN WITH SOMETHING MY FAGS DIDN'T ORDER ANY COPIES AS THEY GOT BURNED ON LAST YEAR'S AEC BLACK BOX THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET RID OF THE ONES THEY HAVE LEFT
YEAH I WAS TOTALLY ON BOARD WITH THE BLACK BOX THAT INCLUDED TRAINS UNTILL I FOUND OUT IT DIDN'T CONTAIN THE BOX I'M A STICKLER FOR THOSE KIND OF THINGS THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN I DIDN'T OWN TRAINS AND IT WAS A KILLER DEAL AT OFF EVEN WITH THE OTHER THROWAWAY GAMES I LIKE THE CONCEPT BUT POOR EXECUTION
PHASE IS A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF FUN CONSIDERING JUST HOW MANY OF THESE MAGES SMASHING MAGES GAMES I HAVE THE MAIN MAGIC HERE IS THAT IT'S NOT A LAST GUY STANDING WINS GAME THIS IS VERY CEREBRAL

IT'S A THINK GAME OF QUICK ADAPTATION TO A CHANGING GAME STATE THERE ARE A MILLION OPTIONS AND THE NICE THING ABOUT THE DECK BUILDING IS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE YOU'LL GET TO USE THAT KILLER COMBO IT MIGHT GET DRAWN INTO YOUR HAND OR ENLISTED AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU DO GET THE KILLER COMBO IT'S DEEPLY SATISFYING TO PULL OFFICIAL

ALL IN ALL NOT DISAPPOINTED I'LL BE BUYING NEXT YEAR'S BLACK BOX IF AEC DOES IT AGAIN

I ORDERED ONE WE STILL HAVEN'T GOT IT YET WAITING
I WATCHED SEVERAL OF YOUR STREAMS INCLUDING THE 2 MOST RECENT ONES AND I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES THAT YOU GUYS ARE FACING WITH YOUR IMPLEMENTATION IN STREAMS THAT ASK TWITCH TO PLAY IN VIDEO GAMES IE TWITCH PLAYS POKEMON ITS VERY SIMPLE FOR THE AUDIENCE TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED BECAUSE THE INTERFACE OF THE ACTUAL GAME IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS WHAT IS DISPLAYED FOR TWITCH THROUGH THE STREAM BUT UNFORTUNATELY BOARD GAMES CANT BE DISPLAYED THAT WAY UNLESS THROUGH A COMPUTER SIMULATION IT'S THESE ISSUES WITH THE INTERFACE THAT CAUSE ME TO HAVE THE MOST PROBLEMS WITH THE STREAM AS IT IS RIGHT NOW

ONE BIG ISSUE WITH YOUR STREAM RIGHT NOW IS HAND IT IS SOMETHING I WOULD LOVE TO ACTUALLY SEE BUT I CANNOT EVER READ WHAT IT SAYS DESPITE USING A MONITOR ON SOURCE QUALITY I'VE ALSO TRIED ON MY LAPTOP WHICH IS 1080 ALSO ON SOURCE QUALITY AGAIN I THINK THIS IS SUPER USEFUL INFORMATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE I CANT READ IT I FEEL LIKE IT JUST GOES TO WASTE A SOLUTION COULD BE FOR YOU GUYS TO CONSOLIDATE YOUR FACES INCLUDING TP SCREEN TO A SMALLER AREA OR REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE TWITCH CHAT BOX OR MAKE THE TWITCH CHAT A TRANSLUCENT BUBBLE THAT FADES AWAY WHEN THERE IS NO ACTIVE CHATTING

ANOTHER ISSUE IS WITH THE HAND WRITTEN CHARTS THAT YOU GUYS USE ON STREAM AGAIN THE ISSUE IS WITH LACK OF VISIBILITY IF YOU WERE ABLE TO USE SOME OVERLAYS THAT JUST SHOWED THE BASIC STATS OF AND YOUR CHARACTERS IF POSSIBLE HAVING TP THERE IS REALLY USEFUL BECAUSE SHE CAN SHOW US WHAT SHE IS WRITING ON THE TWITCH CHARACTER SHEET AND BE OUR VOICE BUT SHE WOULD HAVE A MORE IMPACTFUL ROLE IN THE VIEWER EXPERIENCE IF SHE WAS SIMPLY ABLE TO UPDATE SOME OVERLAY VALUES FOR OUR CHARACTER

I APPLAUD YOU GUYS FOR YOUR EFFORTS AND I HOPE THAT YOU CAN MAKE USE OF MY CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM I LOVE THE IDEA OF YOUR STREAM AND I REALLY WOULD LIKE IT TO REACH IT'S FULL POTENTIAL

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE OVERLAY YOU CAN SEE A FAIRLY GOOD VERSION OF IT ON THE FORGED BY GEEKS CHANNEL HERE
WITH SO MANY VIEWERS HOW DOES THE GAMEPLAY WORK EXACTLY
FOR SOMETHING THAT'S TO BACK IT'S AN INTERESTING THING TO DO

DOES WATCHING IT ON TWITCH GIVE A GOOD IDEA OF HOW THE GAME REALLY WORKS I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE
DON'T FORGET THAT IF YOU HAVE AMAZON PRIME YOU ALSO HAVE TWITCH PRIME ONCE A MONTH YOU CAN LIKE OR SOMETHING A CHANNEL TO SEND THEM SOME MONEY I GAVE MEANT TO FIND A CHANNEL TO BACK AND THIS GIVES ME A GOOD ONE TO FOLLOW AND SEE IF I LIKE IT THANKS
YOU CAN ALSO TRY THE GAME OUT ON TABLETOP SIMULATOR
AT THAT POINT YOU MAY AS WELL JUST PLAY THE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING K M MOD SOMEONE MADE FOR TABLETOP SIMULATOR
AWESOME I'M BUSY TRYING TO LEARN THE GAME AS MUCH BEFORE I PLAY IT WITH FRIENDS SO ANY HELP IS WELCOME
BATTLE FOR GERMANY

WAR

OGRE AND GEV

PLUS MOST OF THE METAGAMING GAMES WARP WAR IS ESPECIALLY FINE FOR A SMALL FOOTPRINT GAME AND MELEE AND WIZARD AND ALL THE ADVENTURES AND MODULES YOU COULD BUY FOR THEM ARE EMINENTLY REPAYABLE
PIXEL TACTICS PERHAPS ALL THE SPACE YOU NEED IS TO LAY OUT TWO SETS OF CARDS IN A GRID GAME IS FUN BUT SUPER SWINGY SO IT'S NOT EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA
NO RETREAT APG EDITION
IF YOU'RE NOT OPPOSED TO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ASTRA TETANUS FROM VICTORY POINT GAMES IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO OGRE PLUS IT FITS IN A
ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER HAS A LOT OF SCENARIOS
I LOVE SOME GAMES I'M HORRIBLE AT IT DOESN'T MAKE THEM LESS FUN
I SUCK AT MOST GAMES TSH
I'M NOT THAT GOOD MYSELF I EVEN TEND TO LOSE GAMES I'VE PLAYED MULTIPLE TIMES AGAINST PEOPLE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE GAME SPLENDOR FORGET IT STONE AGE I'M LUCKY IF I'VE WON OF THE GAMES I'VE PLAYED CASTLES OF BURGUNDY NOPE ALTHOUGH I PROBABLY DON'T LOSE AS OFTEN AS I THINK I DO BUT IT CERTAINLY FEELS LIKE IT

I HAVE NOTICED TWO THINGS THAT HAVE MADE ME THINK ABOUT THE WAY I APPROACH GAMES

IN THE GAMES I'VE PLAYED WHERE I PLAY MORE VISCERALLY I TEND TO DO MUCH BETTER AND EVEN WIN I CAN'T BE SURE BUT SOMETIMES I THINK I SPEND TOO MUCH TIME THINKING I'M BEING CLEVER RATHER THAN JUST CHOOSING THE BEST OPTION THAT MY INSTINCT IS TELLING ME TO CHOOSE

2 THERE ARE SOME EURO GAMES THAT I DO MUCH BETTER WITH THAN OTHERS FIRENZE FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE I TEND TO DO VERY WELL IN WHILE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FULLY PUT MY FINGER ON WHY CERTAIN GAMES ARE BETTER FITS FOR ME THERE MUST BE CERTAIN MECHANISMS THAT MY BRAIN JUST FINDS EASIER TO GRASP

MY POINTS ARE

DON'T BE DISCOURAGED JUST BECAUSE YOU TEND TO LOSE GAMES ARE AS MUCH ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE AS THEY ARE ABOUT THE SCORE IT'S DEFINITELY FRUSTRATING TO LOSE ALL THE TIME BUT I ALSO PLAY GAMES FOR OTHER REASONS JUST KEEP CHANTING WWWWD AS YOU ARE PLAYING WHAT WOULD WILL WHEATON DO

2 DON'T BE SO QUICK TO ASSUME YOU ALWAYS LOSE MAYBE YOU DO MAYBE YOU DON'T I RECOMMEND TRACKING YOUR GAMES IF YOU DON'T ALREADY AND REVIEWING HOW YOU ARE ACTUALLY DOING COMPARED TO HOW YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING YOU MAY BE SURPRISED

CONSIDER THE GAMES AT WHICH YOU LOSE FREQUENTLY VERSUS THOSE AT WHICH YOU LOSE LESS OFTEN OR EVEN FREQUENTLY WIN SEE IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY A TREND IN MECHANISMS OR STYLE AND SEE IF YOU CAN EXPLORE THAT WITH OTHER GAMES

STRATEGY GUIDES ARE USEFUL BUT NOTHING BEATS WATCHING YOUR OPPONENTS AND SPEAKING WITH THEM AFTERWARDS ABOUT THEIR STRATEGY I FIND THAT BLANKET STRATEGY GUIDES ARE NOT THAT EFFECTIVE WHEN APPLYING THEM AGAINST OPPONENT S THAT HAS HAVE DEVELOPED ABOUT THE GAME SO WATCH WHAT THEY DO AND TALK ABOUT THEIR APPROACH AFTERWARD CONSIDER WHETHER YOU WANT TO TRY OUT THE SAME STRATEGY AND PROBABLY FORCE THEM TO ADAPT OR BLOCK THEIR STRATEGY FORCING THEM TO ADAPT ONE OF THE FEW GAMES OF STONE AGE I HAVE WON I SPENT MOST OF IT USING AN AGGRESSIVE DENIAL STRATEGY IN A 2 PLAYER GAME AGAINST SOMEONE WHOSE STRATEGY I KNEW
EURO GAMES IS A VERY BROAD CATEGORY I LOVE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AND MARGI BUT BASED ON THE VIDEOS I'VE SEEN I WOULD NOT LIKE POWER GRID PUERTO RICO I HAVE BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED YET

POWER GRID AND PUERTO RICO ARE BOTH ECONOMIC GAMES SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY SOME EURO GAMES THAT DON'T RELY SO HEAVILY ON ECONOMICS

HERE IS TOP LIST OF THEMATIC EUROS

HERE IS A DICE TOWER TOP TEN EURO GAME LIST SINCE THEY'RE NOT HUGE SOME OF THESE MIGHT BETTER FIT YOUR PLAY PREFERENCES

HAVE FUN



I CAN'T EVER SEEM TO WIN PUERTO RICO I HAVE SOMETHING LIKE PLAYS AND I GET THE GAME PRETTY WELL AND EVERY TIME I DO AN ACTION I'M CONFIDENT IT'S A GOOD DECISION AND NOT HELPING MY OPPONENTS BUT MAN IT JUST SEEMS ALMOST EVERY TIME I GET BURNED THAT GAME IS TOUGH BUT I LOVE IT
I READ THIS IN SOME OTHER THREAD THE OTHER DAY AND I THINK IT IS THE BEST QUOTE WITH THE KEY TO A GOOD GAMENIGHT

WHEN PLAYING A GAME THE GOAL IS TO WIN BUT IT IS THE GOAL THAT IS IMPORTANT NOT THE WINNING REINER KNIAZI PROBABLY AROUND THE FOUNDING YEAR OF THE SHOGUNATE

THIS DESCRIBES EXACTLY WHY I DO LIKE EUROGAMES DESPITE NOT BEING A VERY REGULAR WINNER PUTTING IT LIGHTLY I HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO CAN WIN MORE CONSISTENTLY IN TERRA MYSTIC OR THAN I CAN BUT MAN IS TRYING TO BEAT THEM FUN IT IS THAT CHALLENGE I ENJOY AND I CAN'T IMAGINE ALWAYS WINNING MAKING IT BETTER THE TRYING TO WIN THAT'S THE REAL DRUG
I'VE NEVER PLAYED POWER GRID BUT PUERTO RICO IS A GREAT ENGINE BUILDER ACTION SELECTION GAME DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS BEHIND ENGINE BUILDING GAMES DO YOU RECOGNIZE WHAT YOUR PRIORITIES SHOULD BE AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE GAME HOW TO BUILD AN EFFICIENT ENGINE GET THE BIG BUILDINGS AND MAKE THEM GET POINTS FOR YOU ARE YOU TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE DO YOU TRY TO KEEP YOUR STRATEGY IN FOCUS AND DO THINGS THAT FURTHER YOUR STRATEGY RATHER THAN JUST DO THINGS TO DO THEM THESE GAMES ARE ALL ABOUT EFFICIENCY DOING MORE WITH LESS THAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN YOUR MIND
I LOVE EURO GAMES BUT I NEVER SEEM TO WIN GAMES LIKE AGRICOLA APPEAL TO ME BUT I ALWAYS GET CRUSHED IN GAME

SO FOR ME I JUST TRY TO ENJOY THE GAME WITH WINNING AS MY SECONDARY OBJECTIVE
EURO GAMES ARE ALL ABOUT ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY SEEING THE PATH AND TRYING TO BE AS OPTIMAL AS POSSIBLE POWER GRID IS MORE OF A FINANCE GAME WHICH I ALSO SUCK AT BUT GAMES LIKE PUERTO RICO ARE JUST ECONOMICAL ENGINE BUILDING MAKING GOODS AND SHIPPING SELLING THEM IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY AS POSSIBLE YOU PROBABLY JUST CAN'T FIND THE GOOD PATHS TO TAKE AND WHICH ACTIONS WILL ACCELERATE YOUR ENGINE PERSONALLY I CAN'T SEE THE STEPS IN FINANCE HEAVY GAMES
THE FIRST BIG STEP TO DEVELOPING YOUR PLAY ABILITY IN ANY GAME IS TO DOWNLOAD THE RULES AND UNDERSTAND THEM WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO CORRECTLY TEACH A BRAND NEW PLAYER

BEING ABLE TO VISUALIZE THE ENTIRE GAME IS A HUGE ADVANTAGE
IF YOU EVER GROW TIRED OF POWER GRID I'VE GOT LOTS I'M WILLING TO TRADE FOR IT
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN STRATEGY BETWEEN EUROS LIKE PUERTO RICO AND HANSA TEUTONIA AND EUROS LIKE GLASS ROAD AND CASTLES OF BURGUNDY

HT AND PR BOTH REWARD REPLAYING THEM OVER AND OVER AND FIGURING OUT THE OPTIMAL MOST EFFICIENT MOVES THE INITIAL BOARDSTATE IS EXACTLY THE SAME EACH TIME AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCES ARE STARTING ORDER AND WHAT OTHER PLAYERS DO IT GIVES YOU THE ABILITY IF YOU ARE FOCUSED TO KNOW THE OPTIMAL MOVE IF YOU PLAY THE GAME A LOT ALMOST MAKING THE GAME LIKE CHESS SOMEONE'S STARTING PLAY CAN GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY OR THROW YOU FOR A LOOP IF THEY START OUT WITH A UNIQUE PLAY IF YOU PLAY THIS TYPE OF GAME AGAINST SOMEONE WITH A LOT OF EXPERIENCE PLAYING IT YOU MAY NEED TO GET STOMPED DOZENS OF TIMES BEFORE YOU CAN CRACK HOW TO BEAT THEM

GR AND COB BOTH HAVE SOME RANDOMNESS BUT MOSTLY BASED ON THE ORDER THAT TILES COME OUT KNOWING THAT NOT EVERY TILE WILL COME OUT DURING A PARTICULAR GAME I'M NOT A WHO CAN QUICKLY CALCULATE IN MY HEAD THE PERFECT FIRST FOUR MOVES AND MEMORIZE THEM I'M MUCH BETTER AT LOOKING AT MY CURRENT OPTIONS AND ASSESSING WHAT I THINK THE BEST STRATEGY IS IN MY CURRENT SITUATION GAMES LIKE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY OVERWHELM YOU WITH OPTIONS AN ANIMAL STRATEGY MAY CAUSE YOU TO WIN ONE GAME AND LOSE ANOTHER YOU CAN'T PLAY GLASS ROAD ASSUMING THAT YOU WILL GET THE EXACT SAME PERFECT COMBINATION OF THREE TILES EVERY GAME AND A TILE THAT IS GAME CHANGING IN ONE GAME MAY BE WORTHLESS IN ANOTHER THESE GAMES ARE BEST PLAYED BY BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT BOARD STATE AND CHOOSE A STRATEGY THAT WORKS FOR YOU IN THAT PARTICULAR GAME

SOMETHING LIKE STONE AGE FALLS IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF THE FIRST CATEGORY WHERE FOR THE FIRST FEW MOVES YOU KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO PRIORITIZE GETTING TOOLS AGRICULTURE ADDITIONAL MEEDLESS AND GENERALLY THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A HUGE CHANGE IN STRATEGY BETWEEN WHICH HUTS CARDS COME OUT HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE THAT ASPECT WHERE IF YOU MANAGE TO PULL CARDS THAT GIVE YOU A MULTIPLIER PER STEEPLE YOU PROBABLY WANT TO UNLOCK AS MANY MEEDLESS AS POSSIBLE

KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE IN TYPES OF EUROS IS SOMETHING THAT I LIKE TO MENTALLY KEEP TRACK OF AS IT'S A WAY OF KEEPING YOURSELF FOCUSED IN GAME SINCE BASICALLY EVERY EUROGAME PUNISHES PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS EFFICIENT AND ONE OF THE FASTEST WAYS TO BE INEFFICIENT IS TO BE UNCERTAIN WHICH STRATEGY TO FOLLOW
I WIN INFREQUENTLY I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I TEND TO DO MY TURNS VERY FAST I LIKE TO TAKE AS LITTLE TIME ON MY TURN AS POSSIBLE TO KEEP THINGS MOVING I JUST PLAY FROM MY GUT AND HAVE A DISCOVERY OR SEE WHAT HAPPENS KIND OF MENTALITY
ME BUT I ENJOY SUCKING AT THEM
IT'S A MATTER A QUESTION YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF DO YOU STILL ENJOY YOUR TIME IN THE GAME EVEN WHEN YOU LOSE IF YES THEN I DON'T THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM YOU PROBABLY WILL WIN SOONER OR LATER AND THE VICTORY WILL BE EVEN SWEETER

FOR EXAMPLE I'M PRETTY GOOD IN DUDES ON A MAP WAR STRATEGY GAMES I WIN THEM QUITE OFTEN BUT FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T SEEM TO WIN IN BLOOD RAGE AND IT'S MY COPY OF THE GAME TOO APPARENTLY I'M QUITE BAD WITH DRAFTING GAMES I COMPLETELY SUCK AT WONDERS TOO IT'S NOT LIKE I GET PUMMEPELD BUT I'M ALWAYS LIKE 2ND OR 3RD ETC THING IS I ENJOY PLAYING BR SO MUCH THAT I SIMPLY DON'T CARE THAT'S HOW MUCH I LIKE THE GAME
I SUCK AT ALL GAMES
BUT I OFTEN QUESTION NOW WHY I PLAY THEM AT ALL

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO THEN DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD PLAY GAMES LIKE THAT THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT CREEPS UP AT LEAST ONLINE BUT DON'T LISTEN TO IT EVERYBODY JUST PLAY WHATEVER GAMES THEY PREFER AND LEAVE THE OTHERS ALONE TRUST ME NONE OF US ARE COOLER THAN THE OTHER FOR WHICH BOARD GAMES WE PLAY

I'M TERRIBLE AT MOST BOARD GAMES I PLAY BUT I STILL DIG PLAYING THEM SO I CONTINUE IF YOU FIND THAT YOU DON'T ENJOY GAMES THAT YOU'RE BAD AT THEN REMOVE THOSE FROM YOUR ROTATION

BUT YEAH TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I SUCK AT EURO GAMES
NO BUT I'M KINDA BAD AT MOST EVERY GAME
YOU DON'T NEED TO LIKE THEM IN FACT YOU'VE DESCRIBED WHY THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS A GOOD PICK FOR MORE SOCIAL GAMES
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THEM AND STILL DO ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT GAMES AND COMPETITION IN GENERAL IS THAT YOU GET TO BE NASTY TO PEOPLE IN A SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE WAY

NOW I DON'T MEAN LEGITIMATELY NASTY IN A DISTASTEFUL OR ANNOYING WAY BUT RATHER THAT YOU CAN DROP ALL THE BAGGAGE AND PRETENSE THAT IN OUR DAILY LIVES IS ALWAYS HOVERING AROUND OUR INTERACTIONS YOU CAN ACT IN A PURELY SELFISH WAY AND ARE REWARDED FOR IT THE STAKES ARE JUST HIGH ENOUGH TO BE MEANINGFUL BUT NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO CAUSE HARM AT LEAST THEY SHOULDN'T BE

I SUSPECT IT IS A PERSONALITY THING THOUGH YOU MAY WARM UP TO THE FEELING OF BEING A LYING OVER TIME BUT IF IT'S NOT SOMETHING FOR WHICH YOU HAVE A NATURAL INCLINATION I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU WILL EVER BE FULLY COMFORTABLE
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT EVEN IF PEOPLE CAN COMPLETELY READ YOUR FACE YOU CAN STILL CONTRIBUTE AND DO WELL IN THESE GAMES THEY WILL BE SO CONFIDENT THEY CAN READ ANYTHING YOU DO THAT YOU CAN LURE THEM INTO A WRONG CALL
I OFTEN FIND NEGATIVE BLUFFING WORKS IF YOU ARE ALWAYS NERVOUS WHEN LYING TRY TO ACT NERVOUS WHEN YOU ARE SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN COUP THIS WILL WORK BECAUSE YOU GET CHALLENGED WHILE YOU ACTUALLY DO HAVE THE CARD
BLUFFING ISN'T REALLY MY THING BUT I ALWAYS HAVE A BLAST WITH SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM IT'S FUN TO MESS WITH PEOPLE AND GET IN THEIR HEADS ALSO IF YOU HAVE A TELL JUST START DOING THAT THING EVERY TIME YOU SAY SOMETHING TO MASK WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY LYING YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A POKER FACE YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE CONSISTENT BEHAVIOR EVEN IF IT'S CONSISTENT EVIL GRINNING AND NERVOUS LAUGHING
IT'S LIKE POKER YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO LIE TO ENJOY AND WIN I THINK YOU COULD TRAIN YOURSELF TO DO IT WELL ENOUGH WITH PRACTICE IMHO

HAVE YOU LEARNED TO LIKE BLUFFING GAMES

I HAVE THEY ALLOW ME TO SCAFFOLD NEWCOMERS INTO BG GOT TERRITORY WHERE BLUFFING IS THE GREASE OF THE GAME NOT THE GEARS
I'VE PLAYED THEM THE BEST SO FAR HAS BEEN MAFIA DE CUBA BUT I NEED THEM TO BE OVER IN MINUTES OTHERWISE I GET ANNOYED I'D MUCH RATHER PLAY SOMETHING ELSE WITH INTERESTING STRATEGIC CHOICES
I HATE ALL BLUFFING GAMES I DIE FIRST IN COUP I'VE RECENTLY LOST SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM BY ABOUT POINTS I PLAY WHEN THE GROUP WANTS AND I'M A GOOD SPORT ABOUT IT BUT I LOSE MISERABLY EVERY TIME I JUST LAUGH AT MYSELF WHEN I GET CAUGHT
I DON'T ENJOY BLUFFING GAMES BY AND LARGE THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER GENRES I DO ENJOY AND I FOCUS MY TIME ON THOSE RATHER THAN TRYING TO TEACH A FIGURATIVE PIG TO SINGULAR YOU WASTE TIME AND ANNOY THE PIG

IN THE FEW TIMES I'VE BEEN FORCED INTO PLAYING SOMETHING LIKE COUP I JUST TELL THE TRUTH YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED HOW MANY PEOPLE ASSUME YOU'RE GOING TO LIE AND SCREW THEMSELVES OVER BY CALLING YOU ON A CARD YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
I FEEL SIMILARLY TO YOU AND I'M TOTALLY AT PEACE WITH IT I REALLY DON'T ENJOY THESE GAMES SO I JUST DON'T PLAY THEM
WHICH IS MORE ABSURD YOUR FEAR OF ALL YOUR GAME COMPONENTS BEING MIXED TOGETHER OR THAT THERE ARE SOME OF US THAT WOULD SECRETLY FIND IT FUN TO TRY TO SORT IT ALL OUT AGAIN
TWO THINGS GREASY CHIP FINGERS ON MY CARDS OR SOMEONE SPILLING A COKE OR BEER ALL OVER THE BOARD
FOR ME IT'S NOT ABOUT LOSING MY COLLECTION BUT EVERY TIME I'M BRINGING A NEW GAME TO THE TABLE I WORRY CONSTANTLY ABOUT HOW IT WILL BE RECEIVED THE BEST MOMENT IN BOARD GAMING FOR ME IS SEEING THE LIGHT FLICK ON FOR SOMEONE WHO STARTS GENUINELY ENJOYING A GAME AND HAVING FUN BUT THE WORST IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE UTTERLY MISERABLE WITH YOUR GAME AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE WASTED THEIR TIME I'M PROBABLY HYPERSENSITIVE ON THIS LAST FRONT BUT I TRY TO GO OUT OF MY WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYTIME SOMETHING NEW IS ABOUT TO GO OUT IT'S UNDER THE MOST OPTIMAL OF CONDITIONS

THAT SAID I'M SUPPOSED TO TEACH CONCORDIA TO OTHER PEOPLE TOMORROW AND I'M TERRIFIED THAT THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH DOWNTIME
A ROOF LEAK OR SOME SIMILAR CATASTROPHE DESTROYING MY COLLECTION WHICH IS PROBABLY WORTH MORE THAN MY CAR ON THE OPEN MARKET I'VE STARTED TO MOVE MANY OF THEM INTO LARGE RUBBERMAID TOTES AND WILL PROBABLY TRANSFER THE ENTIRE COLLECTION INTO SUCH CONTAINERS FOR SAFER STORAGE
JEFF ENGLESTEIN POSTED A STORY SOMEWHERE THAT HE HAD A FULLY SORTED COPY OF ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER WITH ALL THE EXPANSIONS S OF COUNTERS DUMPED OUT AND MIXED UP BY HIS SON YEARS LATER AND HE STILL HASN'T SORTED IT OUT YET HE JUST PUSHED THE PILE BACK INTO THE BOXES





ANYTHING INVOLVING LIQUIDS AND CARDBOARD
PEOPLE FOLDING CARDS IN HALF BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AWARE THAT'S A PROBLEM

I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN DURING A GAME OF COSMIC ENCOUNTER AND I NEVER RECOVERED THE NONCHALANCE WAS SURREAL LIKE HOW DO YOU JUST MINDLESSLY FOLD A CARD IN HALF
MY BIGGEST FEAR IS THE REGULARS I PLAY WITH ALL OF A SUDDEN WANT TO PLAY ANIS CRY HAVOC SCYTHE OR ANY OTHER FAD DU JOUR INSTEAD OR OUR REGULAR SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING
THAT I KEEP BUYING GAMES AND MY GAMING GROUP STILL WANTS TO PLAY BARKLE
MY FIANCE TELLS ME THAT SHE DOESN'T ACTUALLY LIKE GAMING AND MAKES ME CHOOSE BETWEEN OUR COLLECTION AND HERALDRY I'D OBVIOUSLY CHOOSE HER BUT THIS WOULD BE WORST CASE SCENARIO
THAT MY WIFE WILL FIND OUT HOW MUCH I'VE SPENT ON ALL OF THESE GAMES
SOMEONE LOSING EXACTLY ONE SMALL COMPONENT THAT JUST BARELY MAKES THE GAME UNPLAYABLE I CAN GET THROUGH THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA OF A DESTROYED GAME BUT THE IDEA THAT IT'S ONLY ONE UNIQUE IRREPLACEABLE CARD AWAY FROM BEING PRISTINE IS INFURIATING
I HAVE CATS THEY HAVE NEVER TOUCHED MY GAMES ON MY SHELVES AND BARELY BOTHER WITH THEM WHEN WE'RE PLAYING MY ONE CAT WILL OCCASIONALLY TRY TO BE SNEAKY AND SMACK A COMPONENT OFF THE TABLE BUT THE SECOND I SAY HER NAME SHE BACKS OFFICIAL MY NIGHTMARE IS THAT I COME HOME TO MY GAMES BITTEN AND CLAWED UP KNOCKED ALL OVER THE FLOOR WITH MY CATS SITTING SMUGLY STARING AT THE DESTRUCTION AND CHAOS THEY'VE CREATED

MY MORE REALISTIC FEAR IS PEOPLE PUTTING MY CARDS AND COMPONENTS IN THEIR MOUTHS OR OPEN MOUTH COUGHING SNEEZING ON THEM HASN'T HAPPENED YET BUT I COULD SEE A FEW PEOPLE AT MY LOCAL SHOP DOING THAT
LOSING MY GAME BAG ON THE BUS TRAIN ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M PACKING GAMES THAT ARE OUT OF PRINTING

2 ALL MY NOT ONLY EXHIBIT AP BUT FEEL THE NEED TO ORATE EVERY THOUGHT GOING THROUGH THEIR HEAD BREAKING DOWN EVERY THEORETICAL SCENARIO
IF EVERY GAME I PLAY I HAVE TO ROLL A DICE TO SEE IF WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN HAPPENS
SO ME AND MY GROUP PLAY ON A POOL TABLE IN MY APARTMENT'S BASEMENT EVERY TIME WE GROUP UP ONE OF US PLAYS AROUND WITH THE POOL BALLS WHILE PLAYING UNTIL ONE OF US DROPS ONE AND IT MAKES A LOUD CRACK WHOEVER OWNS THE GAME THAT IS OUT IS FURIOUS AND IS LIKE OK YOU'RE DONE SO FAR NONE OF US HAVE RUINED ANY OF OUR GAMES BUT I SWEAR ONE OF THESE DAYS WE ARE GONNA BREAK A COMPONENT YET WE KEEP JUGGLING THEM
I GONNA GO WITH FIRE YEP THAT WOULD BE BAD
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT A LITERAL NIGHTMARE

WHEN I WAS A TOURNAMENT SCRABBLE PLAYER SEVERAL TIMES I HAD A NIGHTMARE WHERE I WOULD BE TRYING TO DRAW TILES AND PUT THEM IN FRONT OF ME THE TYPICAL PRACTICE TO VERIFY A PROPER DRAW BUT THEY WOULD KEEP FLIPPING UP AND AS I TRIED TO TURN THEM OVER MORE WOULD FLIP UP ALSO CAUSING MORE TO SPILL OUT OF THE BAG ETC HAVE A FIELD DAY FREUDIANS
OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS INGESTING MY COMPONENTS AND THEN WANTING TO ASK THE PARENTS TO GET THE KID TO VOMIT AND OR SEARCH AND FISH FOR THEM ONCE THEY HIT RAILSIDE
GOING THROUGH THE EFFORT OF SETTING UP A COMPLEX GAME AND THEN HAVING TO PACK IT UP ESPECIALLY IF I STARTED EXPLAINING THE RULES IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TO ME MULTIPLE TIMES
SOMEONE SPILLING COKE ON MY KS EDITION BOX OF THE WALKING DEAD ALL OUT WAR WOULD PROBABLY MAKE ME VOMIT FROM THE PAIN
I'LL STICK TO THINGS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY HAPPENED

PLAYING COSMIC ENCOUNTER WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS RELATIVELY NEW TO THE NEETUP SO I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE AND WELCOMING AT THE END OF THE GAME HE STUCK ALL HIS SHIPS IN A TALL STACK BETWEEN HIS THUMB AND FOREFINGER AND I ASKED CAN YOU PLEASE NOT DO THAT THEY WILL EXPLODE EVERY

CUE LITTLE SHIPS SHOOTING ACROSS THE DINER FLOOR THEN HE KINDLY BLOWS HIS NOSE AT THE TABLE AND PICKS UP EVERY SINGLE SHIP AND TRIES TO HELP ME PUT OTHER STUFF AWAY BASICALLY FINGERING EVERYTHING HE FREAKING COULD APPARENTLY IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO HIM THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE BOTHERED THAT HE DIDN'T WASH HIS HANDS

A WEEK OR TWO LATER THE SAME GUY WAS PUTTING HIS CHIN AND MOUTH INTO A CUP ON THE TABLE AND BITING HIS STRAW WITHOUT HIS HANDS AND KNOCKED A GLASS OF ICE ONTO MY ISTANBUL BOARD I WANT TO BE WELCOMING BUT SO HELP ME



NEXT I WAS DOING A FIRST PLAYTHROUGH OF MY NEWLY DELIVERED KICKSTARTER GAME WE WERE READING THE RULES AND ONE OF THE GUYS I WAS TEACHING KEPT MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT HOW I WAS MAKING HIS HARD AND DOING A GESTURE LIKE HE WAS PLEASURING HIMSELF MEANWHILE THE OTHER PERSON AT THE TABLE WAS SICK AND CONSTANTLY BLOWING HIS NOSE AND THEN TOUCHING BOARD GAME PIECES IT WAS MAYBE A BOON IN DISGUISE THOUGH SINCE IT WOULD BREAK UP THE INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS FROM THE ONE GUY WHO WOULD THEN YELL AT THE OTHER GUY BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS GOING TO GET SICK BUT THAT ONLY MADE HIM FEEL ASHAMED AND SAD AND HE KEPT BLOWING HIS NOSE


ARE THOSE SCARY ENOUGH
HM I LIKE MY GAME COLLECTION BUT I DON'T FEEL OVERLY PROTECTIVE ABOUT IT I TEND TO TREASURE THE TIME I SPEND WITH A GAME AND GOOD FRIENDS MUCH MUCH MORE THAN I VALUE THE SIMPLE MATERIAL SUBSTANCE OF A GAME IF IT WEARS AND TEARS I JUST REPLACE IT

IF YOU LOOK AT IT RATIONALLY YOU SPEND IN TOTAL TOGETHER MUCH MORE MONEY IF YOU WENT WITH YOUR FRIENDS TO THE MOVIES INSTEAD AND GET NO MATERIAL THING TO KEEP OUT OF IT
MY IDEA OF A NIGHTMARE COMES TO MY MIND WHEN I SEE ALL THE PICTURES PEOPLE POST WHEN THEY PLAY BOARD GAMES IN THEIR GROUPS OF THOSE PHOTOS I SEE GLASSES OF BEER OR WINE JUST CASUALLY STANDING ON THEIR TABLES RIGHT NEXT TO THE GAMES I LITERALLY IMAGINE ALL THOSE GLASSES FALL AND SPILLING ALL OVER THE GAMES

IN OUR GROUP WE HAVE A RULE YOU DO NOT EAT OR DRINK BY THE GAME TABLE PERIOD IT'S FINE TO HAVE A BOTTLE OF BEER UNDER THE TABLE OUR TABLES HAVE 2 LEVELS OR A BAG OF PRETZELS ON THE SIDE BUT THAT'S AS FAR AS WE GET
I OPENED A BRAND NEW GAME AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS PRESENT IMMEDIATELY SPILT SOME TEA IN THE BOX IMMEDIATELY

THANKFULLY IT WASN'T THAT BAD BUT FUCKING REALLY IT WASN'T EVEN OPEN FOR THIRTY SECONDS
MY VISION TURNING INTO A SLOW-MOTION SHOT WHERE ONE PLAYER SLOWLY DUMPS A GLASS OF WINE ONTO MY PLOTTER EKLUND GAMES FOLLOWED BY A KID PROJECTILE VOMITING ALL OVER MY MINIATURES SOMEHOW MELTING ALL THE PAINT FURTHER TORTURED BY A SNOT ROCKET THE SIZE OF A PIZZA PAN SLOSHING ONTO MY COPY OF NEUE HEILMAN ALL MY COPIES OF GLORY TO ROME AND SOMEHOW ALL OF MY GAMES EXPLODE INTO FLAMES
CRACKING A BOARD IN HALF I'VE OCCASIONALLY BENT BOARDS TO COERCE THEM INTO LAYING FLAT AND I'VE HEARD JUST ENOUGH HORROR STORIES THAT IT MAKES ME NERVOUS EVERY TIME EVEN WHEN I'M THE ONE DOING THE BENDING
SOMEONE SPILLING DRINKS IT HAPPENED TWICE ON DIFFERENT CARD GAMES LUCKILY THE SECOND TIME THEY WERE SLEEVED NOW PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER TO HAVE DRINKS ON THE GAME TABLE

ALSO TEACHING MY FRIENDS WIFE NEW GAMES SHE HUFFS AND PUFFS AND ACTS LIKE ITS THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD THE COMPLAINS THE ENTIRE FIRST GAME WE PLAY AND USUALLY WANTS TO PLAY AGAIN LATER ITS LIKE PULLING TEETH I WOULDNT HAVE HER OVER IF SHE WASNT MY GOOD FRIENDS WIFE
FOXING I'M ALLERGIC TO FOXING ON CARDBOARD AND PAPER I DON'T LEND MY GAMES TO ANYONE FOR THAT REASON AND I'M SUPER CAREFUL ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S GAMES WHEN PEOPLE DUMP IT AT MY PLACE

STORE IT IN A COOL DRY PLACE IS THE MOTTO HERE
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT'S AN ABSURD NIGHTMARE JUST A HIGHLY UNLIKELY ONE AND AT LEAST ONE EASILY THOUGH PAINFULLY REMEDIED SHOULD IT EVER COME TO PASSIVE


MY ABSURD NIGHTMARE IS PEOPLE LEAVING GREASY FINGER STAINS ALL OVER MY GAME COMPONENTS PARTICULARLY THE CARDS I HOST A LOT SINCE I HAVE GAMES AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT ONE OF MY FRIENDS MUST HAVE HAD SOME LEFTOVER GRIME ON THEIR HANDS BECAUSE THERE WAS RESIDUE ALL OVER THEIR PARTICULAR COLOR DECK OF CARDS FOR MY NEW FAVOURITE GAME CONCORDIA

SO AFTER SPENDING MINUTES DELICATELY THE CARDS THEY AREN'T FULLY PLASTICIZED LIKE SOME OTHER GAMES BUT AT LEAST HAVE A SURFACE AMENABLE TO A DAMP TOWEL I WENT TO MY LOCAL HOBBY SHOP AND BOUGHT WORTH OF SLEEVES AND HAVE SLEEVED EVERY GAME IN MY COLLECTION WHERE PLAYERS KEEP CARDS IN HAND


I WON'T BOTHER FOR GAMES WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE DEALER SINCE IT WILL ALWAYS BE ME OR IF THE CARDS ARE JUST ACQUIRED AND LAID OUT ON THE TABLE BUT FOR ANYTHING PEOPLE HOLD IT IS NOW PROTECTED


I SLEEP BETTER ALREADY
DRINKS SPILLED I KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN SOMEDAY IT HAS ALREADY BEEN VERY CLOSE AS IN THE DRINK WAS SPILLED BUT WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH THAT NO MAJOR DAMAGE HAPPENED BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE IN MY GROUP THAT WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE THEM ON THE GAMING TABLE
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOUR CURRENT D D CAMPAIGN IF SO THERE'S NO REASON TO CHANGE IT UP TOO MANY PEOPLE FALL VICTIM TO CULT OF THE NEW WHERE THEY KEEP CHASING SOME HIGH OF THE NEXT GREAT THING INSTEAD OF SITTING DOWN AND JUST PLAYING WHAT THEY ALREADY HAVE
I WAS ORIGINALLY TOLD AT PAX EAST WE WOULD GET THEM BEFORE THE END OF MAY AND THAT'S WHY I PAID UP WAITING A MONTH OR SO ISN'T THAT BAD

IT'S ALMOST DECEMBER NOW
HELL I BACKED THE KICKSTARTER AND I'M STILL WAITING
HAVE YOU EMAILED THEM
I DID THE KICKSTARTER AND STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MINE I'M A LITTLE PEEVED BECAUSE WHEN I CONTACTED THEM ABOUT IT THEIR RESPONSE IS THAT SINCE I DIDN'T CONFIRM MY SHIPPING ADDRESS IN THEIR SURVEY THEY DIDN'T SEND IT THEY PROMISED I'D GET IT ON THEIR NEXT WAVE BUT I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT HAVING TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE GAME IS AVAILABLE AT RETAIL TO GET MY COPY I'M PROBABLY DONE WITH KICKSTARTERS NOW
SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL SHIP IN NOVEMBER
THANKS FOR CONTINUING TO POST THIS EVERY MONTH I LOOK FORWARD TO IT EVERY TIME



GAMES

MISKATONIC SCHOOL FOR BOYS THIS GAME IS BAD PLAY IS TOO LONG TOO EASY AND RANDOM AND TOO BORING WOULD AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE

BEST GREENHOUSE EVER I APPRECIATE THE SIMPLISTIC DESIGN BUT DRAFTING GAMES AREN'T REALLY MY THING LUCKILY IT'S QUICK SO IT HAS THAT GOING FOR IT

SMALL STAR EMPIRES CUTE LITTLE ABSTRACT I ONLY PLAYED 2 PLAYERS AND I THINK IT MIGHT SHINE WITH MORE DEFINITELY HAS POTENTIAL

VALLEY OF THE KINGS LAST RITES IT'S A DECKBUILDER

ANIS NOT USUALLY ONE TO ENJOY AREA CONTROL GAMES BUT THIS WAS GOOD THE CARD DRAFTING FOR ACTIONS MADE THE STRATEGY INTERESTING WHILE THE LIMITED ACTIONS ALSO WORKED NICELY IT FELT LIKE A FULLY FLESHED OUT VERSION OF MINUTE EMPIRE TO ME

POWER GRID THE CARD GAME DO YOU LIKE POWER GRID BUT DON'T WANT TO SPEND 2 HOURS PLAYING NOW YOU CAN IN ONLY MINUTES IMMEDIATELY WENT TO MY FAGS AND PUT THIS ON PREORDER AFTER PLAYING IT'S EVERYTHING GOOD ABOUT THE AUCTIONS IN THE ORIGINAL BUT WITHOUT THE FIDDLY STEP MATH CALCULATIONS AND NETWORK BOARD

THE GOLDEN AGES THIS SAT ON MY SHELF FOR OVER A YEAR UNPLAYED I REALLY APPRECIATED THE SIMPLISTIC DESIGN AND HOW THAT COUPLES WITH CHANGING VARIABLES STATES EVERY GAME I WILL DEFINITELY PLAY THIS ONE AGAIN HOPEFULLY TONIGHT

TERRAFORMING MARS PLAYED THIS TIMES IN 2 WEEKS THE FIRST TIME IT WAS ENJOYABLE THE SECOND TIME I FELT LIKE I HAD MORE CONTROL OVER MY SITUATION THE THIRD TIME WE PLAYED WITH DRAFTING AND I'M CONVINCED THAT'S THE WAY THE GAME IS MEANT TO BE PLAYED EVERY GAME I'VE CHANGED THE STRATEGY I'VE USED DESPITE HAVING THE SAME CORPORATION IN TWO OF THE GAMES I'LL EITHER TIRE OF IT IN ANOTHER PLAYS OR IT'LL BE A KEEPER FOREVER
GOOD NOW WILL STILL BE GOOD IN MONTHS

A FEAST FOR ODIN LOTS OF GAME IN THE BOX LOTS OF BITS IN THE BOX I'VE GOTTEN PLAYS OUT OF PATCHWORK AND EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT IN A WHILE I'M NOT SICK OF IT A FEAST FOR ODIN IS LIKE PATCHWORK AND AGRICOLA HAD A BABY THAT THEY PUT ON STEROIDS AND CHOPPED INTO A MILLION TINY CARDBOARD BITS EXCELLENT

A GAME OF THRONES HAND OF THE KING NOT A HUGELY COMPLEX GAME BUT IT ALMOST BECOMES DURING PLAY AS PLAYERS TRY TO FIGURE OUT NOT ONLY WHAT BENEFITS THEM BUT HOW TO KEEP THAT MOVE FROM BENEFITING THEIR OPPONENT S THIS HAS A PERMANENT SPOT ON MY FILLER SHELF

KEYFLOWER THE FARMERS EXPANSION ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES GETS ANIMEEPLES ENOUGH SAID

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF I COULD ARGUE WITH PEOPLE ALL DAY LONG ABOUT WHO THE WEREWOLF IS

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF DAYBREAK THE NEW ROLES ARE A BIT CRAZIER WHICH MAKES THE ARGUMENTS MORE FUN

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY AMBITION EXPANSION THE ADDED DICE ARE AN EXCELLENT ADDITION TO THE GAME THE NEW STARTING TILES GIVE ZOFTIG ENOUGH VARIETY AT THE START TO STAY FRESH

GOOD NOW WILL STILL BE GOOD IN MONTHS BECAUSE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO GET TO THE TABLE

CRY HAVOC MORE COMPLEX THAN OTHER AREA CONTROL GAMES I HAVE SO PROBABLY WON'T SEE THE TABLE MUCH AN EXPANSION IS ALREADY IN THE WORKS AND HOPEFULLY ADDRESSES SOME OF THE BALANCE ISSUES I'VE READ ABOUT

GOOD NOW BUT I JUST DON'T SEE IT LASTING

COLONY HOPEFULLY THERE'S EXPANSIONS IN THE WORKS THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME VARIETY IN THE BOX BUT I THINK IT WILL NEED EXPANSION S TO STAY FRESH OVER THE LONG TERM

ANIS I LIKE IT A LOT RIGHT NOW BUT FOR SOME REASON I JUST DON'T SEE IT STANDING UP TO PLAYS I'M NOT SURE WHAT AN EXPANSION COULD ADD WITHOUT CHANGING THE CORE GAMEPLAY SO THIS FALLS HERE FOR NOW

ORLEANS INVASION EXPANSION I'VE ONLY PLAYED THE INVASION SCENARIO SO THERE ARE DEFINITELY OTHER THINGS IN THE BOX I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO BUT IF THEY'RE ALL LIKE THE INVASION SCENARIO PROBABLY WON'T GET PLAYED MUCH AFTER THEY'VE BEEN BEATEN

ALREADY DONE WITH IT

SPECTER OPS NO REASON FOR ANYONE TO PLAY THIS OVER FURY OF DRACULA OR LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL UNLESS YOU DON'T HAVE EITHER OF THEM



IT'S A SOLID GAME BUT DEEP ENOUGH TO PLAY MULTIPLE TIMES AT ONE SITTING IT TAKES PEOPLE A WHILE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO HELP THEMSELVES HURT OTHERS AND BENEFIT FROM FRACTIONAL OWNERSHIP IT MAY BE SIMPLE BUT IT'S A REAL TRAIN GAME
LOVE IT MY MAJOR COMPLAIN ABOUT THE GAME IS THE SETUP YOU HAVE TO USE THE BAG TO PICK RANDOM TRAINS AT THE START AND THEN SORT ALL THE REMAINING TRAINS ALSO IT'S NOT BLINDCOLOR FRIENDLY

BUT I'VE PLAYED IT AT AND ALWAYS A BLAST NICE DEPTH SIMPLE RULES ALMOST NO DOWNTIME AND YOU ALMOST NEVER KNOW WHO'S WINNING BEFORE EVERYONE REVEAL THEIR SCORES
I'VE ONLY PLAYED IT A FEW TIMES BUT I FIND THAT ALL OF THE MAJOR PLUSES OF THE GAME EASE OF RULES SHORT PLAY LENGTH ARE UNDONE BY THE FACT THAT SETTING UP IS SO LONG AND AWKWARD YOU HAVE TO FIRST ROUND UP ALL THE TRAINS TOGETHER AND THEN SECRETLY DEAL OUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT TO EACH PLAYER THEN YOU HAVE TO RESORT THE TRAINS INTO THEIR PILES AND THEN PLACE THEM ON THEIR OWN BOARD EACH TRAIN GOING ON ITS OWN SQUARE THEN YOU HAVE TO PROP UP A SHIELD TO HIDE YOUR TRAINS AND YOU THEN CAN START IF I RECALL CORRECTLY YOUR DECISION ON YOUR TURN IS TO EITHER PLACE UP TO TRAINS OF A SINGLE COMPANY TAKE 2 TRAINS INTO YOUR STASH AND GIVE ONE BACK OR TO TAKE TRAIN INTO YOUR STASH BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY COMPANIES AND SO MANY TRAIN AMOUNTS AND PLAYER TO KEEP TRACK OF IT CAN BE OVERWHELMING TO FOLLOW EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO PLAY GOOD MOVES

I PREFER CHICAGO EXPRESS AS IT GIVES YOU THAT TRAIN BIDDING ACTION THAT'S DONE IN A MUCH MORE CLEARER WAY I FIND SORTING TO BE LESS OF AN ISSUE HERE BECAUSE THE RATIO OF SETUP TIME TO GAME TIME IS A LOT LESS THAN PC EVEN THOUGH PC IS THE QUICKER GAME
WITH DARK CITY A LOT OF MARVEL DIFFICULTY PROBLEMS CAN BE FIXED SO YEAH GO FOR IT IF YOU LIKE THE THEME DO NOTE THAT THE PURE BASE SET MAY FEEL A BIT BLAND COMPARED TO ALIEN THERE'S LESS MECHANICS AND LACKING COORDINATE IN THE BASE SET HURTS CO-OP
I HAVE NOT PLAYED THE LEGENDARY ENCOUNTER GAMES BUT ONE THING I HEAR FROM LOTS OF PEOPLE ABOUT THE TWO IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY THINK THAT ENCOUNTERS IS A BETTER SYSTEM MARVEL HAS SUCH A GREAT THEME THAT THEY OVERLOOK IT I REALLY LIKE MARVEL LEGENDARY AND IF YOU ENJOY SUPERHEROES A LOT I SUGGEST IT THEY HAVE A GIANT VARIETY OF HEROES AND EXPANSIONS

MOST HERE WILL SUGGEST GETTING DARK CITY TO UP THE DIFFICULTY BUT I THINK THE RECENT CIVIL WAR ONE WOULD WORK AS WELL EVEN A FEW OF THE MINI EXPANSIONS HAVE TOUGH VILLAINS IF YOU END UP ENJOYING IT ODDS ARE YOU WILL WANT TO COLLECT THEM ALL ANYWAYS
DARK CITY IS WIDELY REGARDED AS THE ESSENTIAL EXPANSION AND I'LL THROW SECRET WARS VOL INTO THE RING AS WELL FOR THE ADDITION OF SIDEKICKS

REGARDING THE MOST PEOPLE JUST PLAY IT AS CO-OP AND MAYBE CHECK ON THE MVP AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT THE HARDER VILLAINS FROM EXPANSIONS HELP TO THAT END

IN MY OPINION BIG ADVANTAGE OVER ALIEN IS ITS ENDLESS VARIETY IF ALIEN'S REPLAY VALUE WORKS FOR YOU PREDATOR MIGHT BE A BETTER BUY THAN MARVEL
I REALLY DID NOT LIKE MARVEL LEGENDARY AND WAS NOT ABOUT TO DROP ANOTHER AND MORE TO FIX A BASE GAME THAT WAS NOT COMPELLING

I WAS ANXIOUS GETTING LEGENDARY ALIENS IN A MATH TRADE AFTER MY MARVEL EXPERIENCE BUT I AM SO GLAD I DID IT IS THE SAME SYSTEM BUT MUCH SUPERIOR

MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO TRY TO MARVEL LEGENDARY FIRST BEFORE BUYING IF YOU CAN BUT FRANKLY I WOULD STICK TO THE LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS GAMES AS IT IS A SUPERIOR SYSTEM
I THINK THEY'RE JUST VASTLY BETTER CARDS BUT A COUPLE SEEM A LITTLE OVERPOWERED ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN FIVE COIN A BANDIT FIRST TURN MORE FUN THAN THE CARDS THEY REPLACED THOUGH

HAS ANYONE BOUGHT THE UPDATE FOR INTRIGUE I'D LIKE TO HEAR ANY EXPERIENCES WITH THAT SINCE I'VE YET TO PURCHASE IT
I LIKE WHAT I SEE BUT HAVENT GOTTEN TO TRY YET I'M STILL HOLDING OUT HOPE FOR ANOTHER BIG BOX LIKE MAYBE WITH ADVENTURES EMPIRES OR SOMETHING
I'M JUST ANNOYED THAT I BOUGHT THE GAME A FEW MONTHS AGO AND NOW IT'S BEEN REPLACED
YES THEY ARE THE SAME SIZE BUT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER YOU CAN EVEN COMBINE PICTURES WITH THE BASE GAME DESPITE THE CARDS NOT EVEN THE SAME SIZE
I'M PRETTY SURE THEY ARE BUT I'M SURE THEY CAN BE COMBINE EVEN IF CARD SIZES DIDN'T MATCH PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY TRIED COMBINING PICTURES WITH THE ORIGINAL AS WELL FOR THE SET-UP AND THOSE CARD SIZES ARE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT SHAPED RECTANGLES I FORGOT WHICH GRID PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED TO USE AND HOW THE PICTURES AND WORDS WERE ARRANGED I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY COMBINED THE UNDERCOVER VERSION WITH THE ORIGINAL BUT MY SISTER TOOK THE ORIGINAL TO HER SCHOOL
I IMMEDIATELY MERGED MY COPIES AND IT ACTUALLY WORKS QUIET WELL JUST BE SURE TO FILTER IT WHEN BRINGING IT TO FAMILY FOR THE HOLIDAYS

I'D SAY GO FOR IT
THE CARDS CAN BE INTERTWINED JUST PERFECTLY FIT STYLE WISE

SO FAR I HAVEN'T THOUGH I'VE WONDERED IF THIS WOULD CREATE BALANCE ISSUES
RECOGNISE THAT TREATING EVERYONE EQUITABLY ISN'T THE SAME AS TREATING EVERYONE THE SAME

THIS IS AN INTERESTING POINT AND PUT VERY WELL ESPECIALLY THE IDEA THAT NOT EVERYONE WILL BE AFFECTED OR BENEFIT EQUALLY FROM MEASURES USED TO MAKE THE SPACE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE ITS STUFF WE'VE HEARD BEFORE BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD IT PUT IN THOSE TERMS

THE AUTHOR ALSO THANKFULLY AVOIDS WHITE MALE TERRORIST TYPE LANGUAGE DESPITE MAKING MANY OF THE SAME POINTS GOOD READ
AS A WOMAN IN THE HOBBY I CAN'T SAY I'VE EVER BEEN TREATED DIFFERENTLY FOR ANY REASON I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HAD SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME THE RULES OF A GAME I ALREADY KNEW IN A PATRONISING FASHION I EAST MANSPLAIN I'VE NEVER HAD INAPPROPRIATE ATTENTION OR BEHAVIOUR DIRECTED TOWARDS ME ASIDES FROM WHEN I INFLATED AN CLUB AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID VERY LOUDLY WOW YOU'RE SO GOOD AT BLOWING BUT I DIGRESS I ATTEND A BOARD GAMING CLUB AT MY LOCAL UNIVERSITY AND I'VE ONLY PLAYED IN A FAGS ONCE WHERE I WILL NOT BE GOING AGAIN AS IT'S MAINLY CGS I'VE NOT SEEN WOMEN TREATED INCREDIBLY DIFFERENTLY TO MEN BUT I CAN ACCEPT THAT PERHAPS THE CLUB'S MEMBERSHIP IS VERY REASONABLE AND CONSIDERATE COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE

HOWEVER MY EXPERIENCE IN OTHER SITUATIONS MAINLY ONLINE GAMING HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT USING TABLETOP SIMULATOR ONLINE WITH PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING FLAMED PURELY ON MY GENDER BOARD GAMING TENDS TO BE VERY DIFFERENT AS PEOPLE RARELY PULL THAT SHIT IN PERSON BUT I DON'T PUT IT OUT OF THE REALMS OF POSSIBILITY IF YOU'RE THERE WHEN IT HAPPENS AND YOU'RE AT THE TABLE DON'T IGNORE IT PEOPLE PLAY GAMES TO ESCAPE AND HAVE FUN THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH BULLSHIT LIKE RACIST COMMENTS SEXUAL COMMENTS MISRENDERING ETC
TIP NUMBER ONE DON'T PLAY WITH ASPHALTS TIP NUMBER TWO DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE MAKE UP OF YOUR PLAYERS BECAUSE THAT IS PROBABLY THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHEN THINKING OF GAMING
THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS

I HONESTLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ARE SOME USERS HERE WHO FEEL LIKE THIS ISN'T SOMETHING WORTH DISCUSSING HERE I UNDERSTAND KEEPING POLITICS OUT OF GAMING BUT THIS ISN'T POLITICS THIS IS COMMON SENSE

I WELCOME ALTERNATIVE OPINIONS ON THE MATTER IF YOU HAVE ANY
AH BOY YET ANOTHER INCLUSION CAMPAIGN THREAD GOING ON CAN THE MODS PLEASE BE MORE OBJECTIVE AND NOT JOIN ON A SIDE NOT EVERYONE IS COOL WITH THE PC AGENDA BEING CRAMMED DOWN OUR THROATS

AS I MENTIONED IN A PREVIOUS POST GAMING IS GOING TO BE A WHITE MALE DOMINATED HOBBY NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO MOST TABLETOP GAMERS ARE MEN MORE THAN OF AMERICANS ARE WHITE WHITE MEN ARE GOING TO SHOW UP MORE BECAUSE OF STATISTICS THERE IS NO WAY EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE EQUALLY REPRESENTED

SECONDLY NO I DON'T NEED TO SUBSCRIBE TO THESE RULES OR SUGGESTION THAT THIS PERSON MAKES I GO TO GAMING EVENTS TO PLAY A GAME I LIKE MEET SOME PEOPLE AND GO HOME IF THERE'S A CRAZY PSYCHO IT'S NO MORE UPON ME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AS ANYONE ELSE

THIRDLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF GAMING EVENTS ARE FILLED WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE NICE REASONABLE AND DON'T DO ANYTHING LISTED BY THE WRITER THE WRITER IS TAKING ONE UNFORTUNATE EVENT AND PAINTING THE ENTIRE HOBBY WITH IT YES THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME WEIRD AND AWKWARD GUYS BUT THERE ARE ALSO CASES WHERE SOME WOMEN END UP BEING PSYCHOS AS WELL WE CAN'T TAKE A FEW ANECDOTES AND THEN USE IT TO LABEL AN ENTIRE GROUP OF PEOPLE

IF THE WRITER WANTS SUPPORT FROM GAMING VETERANS SHE SHOULD TRY GETTING TO KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO ATTEND THESE EVENTS WHO ARE GOING TO BE GUYS SHE SHOULD GET TO KNOW HOW THEY ARE WHAT THEY DEAL WITH AND WHAT THEY LIKE TO PLAY AS IT IS SHE IS TAKING AN ISOLATED CASE WITH A PSYCHO GENERALIZING THAT IT OCCURS FREQUENTLY AT GAMING EVENTS AND THEN DEMANDING THE GAMERS THAT SHE BARELY KNOWS TO FIX IT FOR HERALDRY

I'M FOR EQUALITY BUT WHEN YOU WANT AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY TO CATER FOR YOU YET YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF GAMING CULTURE IT COMES OFF AS VERY SELFISH AT THE VERY LEAST SHE NEEDS TO CONFRONT THIS PERSON AND TELL HIM TO STOP AND REPORT TO HER SUPERIORS THAT SHE IS BEING HARASSED NO AMOUNT OF REGULATIONS ARE GOING TO KEEP THE WEIRDOS AWAY UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING LUCKILY WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE WHICH IS TO REPORT ANY WRONGDOING TO THE PERSON IN CHARGE IF THAT PERSON DOESN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT THEN IT'S A PROBLEM BUT I DON'T WANT SOMEONE TELLING ME HOW I NEED TO BEHAVE AT AN EVENT I WANT TO ENJOY AS I LIKE

SO AGAIN THE WAY I GO ABOUT GAMING EVENTS IS I GO TO THEM GREET OTHERS AND PLAY THE GAMES I WANT TO PLAY AND GO HOME I DON'T NEED OR WANT PEOPLE TELLING ME I NEED TO STAND UP FOR EQUALITY OR MAKE AN AREA INCLUSIVE OR NOT THAT'S THEIR FIGHT AND NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO AGREE WITH IT GAMING IS GENERALLY A VERY INCLUSIVE HOBBY AND ANYONE THAT SAYS OTHERWISE IS GOING TO NEED MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF ANECDOTES TO SUPPORT THEIR WORDS
MARY SUE

GAG
MAKING GAMING WELCOMING FOR EVERYONE MEANS WELCOMING FOR WEIRDOS SOUNDS LIKE THIS LADY MET A WEIRDO

BEFORE THE MODERN BOOM GAMING WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE EVEN PEOPLE WHO WERE OFFENSIVE OR HAD NO SOCIAL SKILLS NOW THE DEMAND FOR INCLUSION IS JUST EXCLUSION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ACCEPTED LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE

NOBODY IS TRYING TO KEEP GAMING WHITE AND MALE BUT WHEN WOMEN COME TO THE GAME STORE FILLED WITH MEN WHO CAN'T GET A DATE THEY WONDER WHY IT ISN'T WELCOMING TO WOMEN

EXCLUSION AND BULLYING IS NOT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN GAMING THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS DEPRESSION
I FIND SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE TO BE RIDICULOUS IF A DOLLAR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY DOESN T HAVE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY IN THEIR TRAINING HANDBOOK FOR STAFF WHAT S THE CHANCE MY FRIENDLY LOCAL GAME STORE DOES IN REGARDS TO WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY RESPONDING TO I EAST EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAD SUCH A POLICY WOULD MR HAVE BROKEN ANY RULES NOPE THOUGH THAT WOULD HAVE CHANGED IF SHE HAD TOLD MR THAT HE NEEDED TO STOP FOLLOWING HER AROUND

BUT IF MR BROKE A LAW NOW THAT'S DIFFERENT AND RESOLVED VERY EASILY BY FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE POLICE SERIOUSLY IF A FRIEND OF MINE WAS HAVE TROUBLE LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE A CHOICE BETWEEN THE POLICE OR A GANG OF US TALKING JUST TO THE OFFENDER AND LETTING HIM OR HER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FROM THEN ON

THEN SHE WEASELS HER WAY INTO THE SUBJECT OF DEPICTIONS IN GAMES AS IF WARKHAMMER S DEPICTION OF ORKS MADE MR WANT TO FOLLOW HER AROUND LIKE A PUPPY AS A PUBLISHER I'M SURE THEY ARE MINDFUL AND THOUGHTFUL WHEN THEY MAKE MOST ALL THE PEOPLE MAKING IMPORTANT BUSINESS DECISIONS IN A RENAISSANCE GAME WHITE MEN THE QUESTION CAN BE DO WE NEED ANOTHER RENAISSANCE GAME

HER TWO LAST POINTS I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH
TREATING THEM LIKE PEOPLE ONLY BEING FRIENDS WITH GUYS WHO WILL DO THE SAME AND NOT REFERENCING TERRIBLE BLOGS LIKE THE MARY SUE WOULD BE MY ADVICE

OR JUST THE FIRST TWO
I'M CONFLICTED ABOUT THIS ARTICLE

ONE THE ONE HAND I REALLY AM FOR INCLUSION SAFE SPACES AND SO ON I THINK WE SHOULD BE WELCOMING AND SHOULD STRIVE TO MAKE THE HOBBY A PLACE FOR EVERYONE I MYSELF HAVE INDUCTED THE WOMEN I WORK WITH INTO THE HOBBY AND INVITED THEM TO MY HOUSE FOR HAVE POSTED ABOUT THE ISSUE ON BG AND FEMALE REPRESENTATION IS MY TIEBREAKER WHEN I'M ON THE FENCE ABOUT A GAME I'VE SKIPPED ON MORE THAN ONE GAME BECAUSE IT HAD POOR FEMALE REPRESENTATION HYPERBOREAL ULTIMATE WARRIOR DEFENDERS OF THE LAST STAND ETC

HOWEVER TWO THINGS BUG ME ABOUT THIS THE FIRST IS THIS ONE
THAT S WHY DEPICTIONS IN GAMES MATTER IF THE GAMES WE PLAY PERPETUATE SEXIST RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC TROPES THAT S NOT ACTUALLY HELPING TO FIX THE PROBLEM FOR THOSE IN THE BUSINESS OF PRODUCING GAMES THAT MEANS BEING MINDFUL AND THOUGHTFUL OF HOW YOU DEPICT ALL PEOPLE IN YOUR GAMES DO YOU HAVE WOMEN WHO EXIST ONLY AS SUPPORT OR PRIZES ARE PRESENT IN YOUR GAME IF THEY ARE ARE THEY HEROIC AGENTS OR ARE THEY ONLY DEPICTED IN ENEMY ROLES IF YOUR GAME HAS RELATIONSHIP MECHANICS ARE THE ONLY ONES AVAILABLE NORMALIZING HETEROSEXUAL ONES THINK ABOUT YOUR GAMES AND HOW THEY MAY BE PERPETUATING HARMFUL TROPES YES BELOVED DMS AND MS I M SPEAKING TO YOU TOO

I HONESTLY DON'T LIKE THIS I THINK THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WANTING A GROUP TO BE WELCOMING ASKING FOR CONTENT TO BE CREATED FOR YOU AND LABELING CONTENT YOU DON'T LIKE AS BAD I TOO EXERCISE WHEN BUYING GAMES AND I TALK ABOUT WHAT I WOULD BUY BUT I DON'T WANT TO SHAME PEOPLE INTO NOT MAKING THE GAMES THEY WANT GAMES WITH ONLY MEN OR EVEN WITH ONLY WHITE MEN ARE NOT MORALLY WRONG THEY ARE JUST NOT FOR ME AND WHILE I MIGHT NOT BUY SUCH A GAME IT'S NOT WRONG TO MAKE IT IT'S NOT COOL TO CLAIM SOMEONE IS RACIST JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T INCLUDE IOCS IN HIS GAME THERE MIGHT BE A TON OF REASONS FOR IT OTHER THAN RACISM AND THIS TEXT IGNORES THEM NOT COOL

SECOND IS THIS
SIMILARLY HAVING A POLICY FOR SEXIST RACIST HOMOPHOBIC OR ABLEST SLURS DOESN T AFFECT OR BENEFIT EVERYONE EQUALLY BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES MAKE THE TABLE A LOT MORE EQUAL

THIS IS A HOBBY WE DO IT FOR FUN I'M ALL FOR INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE AND BEING NICE BUT GAMING IS MY AS WELL IF I'M AT A CON OR SOMETHING THAN SURE I'LL DO MY BEST TO BE USE BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE GUARDED ALL THE TIME I DON'T WANT TO FEAR SAYING SOMETHING WRONG IT'S NOT COOL TO TRY AND TAKE MY SPACE AND POLITICIZE IT YES EVERYTHING IS POLITICAL BUT SO IS THE INVASION INTO MY HOBBY MY LANGUAGE MY SPACE I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS IS RETARDED AND GET ADMONISHED BECAUSE I WAS ABLEST THIS KIND OF THING JUST SUCKS THE FUN OUT OF MY GAME AND I SHOULDN'T BE EXPECTED TO GIVE UP MY HOBBY FOR OTHERS AGAIN NOT COOL
MANY THINGS HERE I HADN'T EVEN CONSIDERED IMPORTANT READ
I ALWAYS FIND THE VOTE PERCENTAGE ON THIS KIND OF POST INTERESTING SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE SILENT PORTION OF OUR LITTLE COMMUNITY DOESN'T IT
THE ARTICLE IS OBVIOUS IF YOU HAVE RESPECT FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND SOME SOCIAL EXPERIENCE BUT THAT ISN'T THE CASE FOR EVERYONE SO IT NEEDS TO BE SAID IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH IT NEEDS TO BE SAID BY HOW OFTEN PEOPLE BITE OTHER PEOPLES CARDS WIPE SNOT ON THEIR HANDS HAVE POOR PERSONAL HYGIENE ETC BY THE COMMENTS ON THIS BOARD I JUST HOPE THE PEOPLE WHO NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND IT READS IT AND GETS IT

THE ARTICLE IS ABOUT GETTING RID OF DANGEROUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE BEHAVIOR TOWARDS WOMEN SUCH AS STALKING AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT THE COMMENTS IS MOSTLY PETTY BULLSHIT FROM PEOPLE WHO TAKE OFFENSE AT EVERYTHING

THE PEOPLE PUSHING THIS MESSAGE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE IT STOPS THERE SOME OF THE COMMENTS GIVE OFF A REAL TUMBLR VIBE IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT ESPECIALLY THE POST ABOUT HAVING AN X CARD YOU CAN PUT IN IF THE DIRECTION THE RPG GAME IS TAKING IS DISTRESSING YOU THE ONE ABOUT INCLUDING GENDERS WTF I COULD GO ALONG WITH IT JOKINGLY BUT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED OFFENSIVE

SCANTILY CLAD MEN AND WOMEN SLAVES ETC IN BOARDGAMES WHERE IT IS SUITABLE IS FINE MAKING A COMMENT TO A FEMALE PLAYER ABOUT HOW YOU WISH SHE WAS WEARING THAT FUR BIKINI IS NOT IF YOU FEEL DISTRESSED ABOUT PLAYING AN RPG WHERE YOU ARE SAVING A PRINCESS YOU ARE THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO ADAPT IF A BLACK DUDE IS UNCOMFORTABLE PLAYING A GAME WITH SLAVES LIKE PUERTO RICO COLONISTS OR FIVE TRIBES WE CAN PLAY SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE I'M NICE LIKE THAT BUT THERE AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH THE GAME
REMOVED
I HAD MY DAUGHTER SIT WITH ME AS I PLAYED AND SHE KEEPS SUGGESTING ILLEGAL MOVES SUCH AS PUTTING POKER CHIP IN MOUTH PUTTING HEX TILE IN MOUTH AND PUTTING CALCULATOR IN MOUTH NO RESPECT FOR THE RULES AT ALL
NONE OF MY FAMILY WOULD ENJOY GAMES BUT WE PLAY A LOT OF UNION PACIFIC
I'M GOING TO TRY TO INTRODUCE TRICK OF THE RAILS TO MY FAMILY NOT SURE IF THAT COUNTS BUT I THINK IT WILL GO OVER WELL AS THEY HAVE LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH STANDARD GAMES
I M PLANNING TO GET AN GAME I HAVEN T TRIED ANY OF THE PREVIOUSLY SO THIS WOULD BE MY INTRO GAME COMPLEXITY ISN T AN ISSUE BUT SHORTER TIME PLAY WOULD BE A BONUS SINCE THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO GET TO THE TABLE I M ALSO LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WOULD PLAY WELL WITH PLAYERS

BASED ON GUIDES AND THE COMMENTS IN THIS THERE ARE THREE MAIN GAMES THAT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE AND

SEEMS LIKE IT SCALES WELL FROM PLAYERS AND SEEMS TO BE WELL REGARDED AS A GAME THAT CAN BOTH BE USED AS AN INTRO AND HAS STAYING POWER

SEEMS LIKE IT PLAYS WELL WITH PLAYERS AND IS MUCH SHORTER THAN AT MIN RATHER THAN MIN THOUGH THE PLAYING TIME AT DEEP THOUGHT GAMES IS LISTED AS HOURS I ALSO LIKE THE IDEA OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS BETWEEN COMPANIES

SO I M WONDERING HOW THE TWO GAMES COMPARE IN GAME STYLE AND PLAY LENGTH DO THEY HAVE THE SAME PLAY TIME OR IS SHORTER WHICH ONE DO YOU PREFER NOT AS AN INTRO GAME BUT IN GENERAL

MY WIFE PLAYS GAMES AND I GENERALLY TEACH SO IN THAT WAY I CERTAINLY HAVE INTRODUCED TRAIN GAMES TO MY FAMILY THE REST OF THE CLAN NOT SO MUCH I TAUGHT HER FAMILY TR E BUT OUR HOLIDAY TIME MOSTLY REVOLVES AROUND YOUNG CHILDREN NOW MAYBE I'LL TEACH THEM GAMES WHEN THEY GET OLDER
I PLAY A BUNCH OF GAMES WITH MY HUSBAND AND JUST PLAYED A GAME OF ROLLING STOCK WITH HIM LAST NIGHT BUT EXCLUDING HIM I HAVEN'T PLAYED HEAVY TRAIN GAMES WITH ANYONE ELSE IN MY FAMILY WE DO HAVE SOME GOOD WINSOME TRAIN GAMES THOUGH AND WE PLAYED TRANSAMERICA WITH MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY OVER THANKSGIVING EVERYONE REALLY ENJOYED IT AND WANTED TO PLAY MULTIPLE TIMES ANOTHER GAME THAT I'LL WANT TO PLAY WITH MY FAMILY WHEN WE VISIT OVER THE HOLIDAYS IS PARIS CONNECTION WHICH IS SUPER EASY AND SHORT BUT ALSO HAS A LOT OF STRATEGY AND IS A GREAT INTRODUCTION TO SHARED INCENTIVE GAMES
I DON'T USUALLY GET TO PLAY WITH MY FAMILY AS THEY LIVE IN THE UK AND I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA HOWEVER MY PARENTS ARE COMING FOR A VISIT IN JANUARY SO SOME GAMING WILL TAKE PLACE I DON'T THINK THAT WILL APPEAL BUT TR RAILWAYS OF THE WORLD AND POSSIBLY CHICAGO EXPRESS SHOULD HIT THE TABLE

WHAT DOES EVERYONE THINK OF IBERIAN RAILS IT COULD BE A NEW CONTENDER FOR A FAMILY FRIENDLY TRAIN GAME LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE HITTING KS IN DECEMBER THE RULES ARE OUT

TRACK TRACK IS LAID BY PLACING CUBES IN HEXES
CHARACTER CARDS THE CHARACTER YOU CHOOSE DETERMINES WHAT ACTIONS A RAILROAD MAY PERFORM
OCCUPATION FEE MUST PAY A FEE TO OCCUPY THE SAME HEX AS ANOTHER RAILROAD
HOTELS YOU CAN BUILD HOTELS THAT WILL GENERATE REVENUE FOR THE PLAYER
SHARE VALUE SHARE VALUE INCREASES AS THE NUMBER OF CITIES A RAILROAD IS CONNECTED TO INCREASES NEVER DECREASES
OPEN AUCTION PAYOUT CEO PUTS OUT SHARE PLAYERS BID TO BUY THE SHARE MONEY PAID TO RAILROAD PAYOUT BANK PAYS SHARE VALUE TO ALL WHO HOLD A SHARE
CLOSED AUCTION PAYOUT CEO PUTS OUT SHARE PLAYERS HOLD A SECRET BID IN THEIR HAND AND REVEAL MONEY PAID TO CEO PAYOUT BANK PAYS SHARE VALUE TO ALL WHO HOLD A SHARE
PERSONAL MONEY IS KEPT HIDDEN BEHIND A SCREEN
WHEN FOUR OF THE RAILROAD COMPANIES HAVE NO SHARE IN THEIR SHARE RESERVES OR IF ONE OF THE RAILROAD COMPANIES HAS CONNECTED TO CITIES THE GAME WILL END AFTER THE CURRENT ROUND
AFTER THE GAME HAS ENDED EACH SHARE HELD BY A PLAYER PAYS OUT TWICE ITS VALUE AS INDICATED BY THE PAYOUT TABLE
RECENTLY

I BOUGHT PARIS CONNECTION AND PLAYED WITH MY FAMILY I LIKE IT SINCE IT IS A REAL GAME THAT PLAYS IN MINUTES THE MECHANICS ARE EASY ENOUGH FOR A KID TO PLAY BUT THE STRATEGY IS PRETTY SOLIDLY IN THE GROWN-UP CATEGORY
I BROKE OUT TICKET TO RIDE WITH MY MOM WHEN SHE CAME TO VISIT SHE IS NOT A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER SO GAMES WITH LOTS OF TEXT ARE A NO-GO BUT I KNEW SHE WOULD LIKE A SIMPLE SET COLLECTION GAME LIKE THIS ON TOP OF THAT SHE WON WE PLAYED TOO AGGRESSIVELY TRYING TO COMPLETE TOO MANY TICKETS



TURNAGAIN GAMES NOW HAS NORTH AMERICAN RAILWAYS IN STOCK I REALLY WANTED TO PLAY IT AT BUT NO ONE HAD IT IT'S APPARENTLY A LIGHT TRAIN CARD GAME
QUESTION IF MY TRACK RUNS INTO THE SIDE OF A TILE BUT DOES NOT CONNECT CAN I UPGRADE THAT TILE TO MAKE IT WORK
IS THERE ANYONE WITH THE KNOW-HOW TO CREATE A COMPUTER PROGRAM OR SMART PHONE APP THAT LETS YOU PLAY GAMES AGAINST COMPUTER OPPONENTS AND OR HUMAN PLAYERS I'VE TRIED THE OLD COMPUTER GAME AND IT'S SIMPLY AWFUL

SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD MAKE ENTERING INTO THE LINE OF GAMES SO MUCH EASIER AND I IMAGINE IT WOULD ONLY SWELL THE RANKS OF GAMERS AS IT IS I'M DYING TO GIVE ONE OF THESE GAMES A TRY BUT I CANNOT LOCATE A SINGLE GROUP IN OUR AREA EVEN IF I COULD I CAN'T GET SIX HOURS STRAIGHT TO PLAY I'M DYING FOR A PROGRAM LIKE THIS SO THAT I CAN DIP A TOE INTO THE SERIES
DOES TRAIN HEIST COUNT AS A TRAIN GAME
COLOR ME INTRIGUED BCOM IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES AND I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY THE TACTICAL SQUADBASED STRATEGY GAME WASN'T MORE COMMON IN BOARDGAME FORM
FOR MORE INFORMATION I RELEASED THE FIRST DEVELOPER BLOG ENTRY A WEEK AGO
BLOGPOST
WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER TESTING DIGITALLY WITH TABLETOPIA OR TSS
INSPIRED BY SUCH CLASSIC COMPUTER GAMES AS UFO DEFENSE AND LASER SQUAD INVASION FREE STATE IS A COMPETITIVE URBAN TACTICAL COMBAT BOARD GAME FOR 2 TO PLAYERS IN EACH MISSION ALIEN AND RESISTANCE FACTIONS CONDUCT COMBAT AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A DESOLATE DISTRICT OF ANNAPOLIS SUBURBS

TO WIN YOU NEED TO PREDICT AND AVOID THE ENEMY MANEUVERS WITH SIMULTANEOUS INITIATIVE AND ACTION SELECTION SYSTEM USE COVER TO YOUR ADVANTAGE AND DON'T LET THEM OUTFLANK YOU

ENDLESS VARIABILITY IS PROVIDED THANKS TO A MODULAR BOARD AND THE UNIQUE CHARACTER SELECTION SYSTEM

OHHHHHH NICE
LOOKS AWESOME DROPPED YOU A PM
SO HOW DOES THE ACTION SELECTION WORK I CHOOSE THAT I WANT TO MOVE AND ATTACK FOR A UNIT THEN WHEN THAT UNIT GETS ACTIVATED I GET TO CHOOSE HOW HE MOVES AND WHO WHERE HE ATTACKS
COUNT ME IN IF YOU NEED AN ADDITIONAL TESTER I'M US BASED
I'D DEFINITELY BE INTERESTED MY GAME GROUP IS NOVICES AND EXPERIENCED SO I COULD GIVE YOU BOTH IMPRESSIONS YOU
DEFINITELY SEEMS INTERESTING US BASED HERE WITH WEEKLY GROUPS OF PLAYERS IF YOU STILL NEED IT
PM SENT
US PLAYER HERE I'D LOVE TO TEST IT OUT WITH MY GROUP WHAT DO I NEED TO DO
I'M LOVING THE IDEA BEHIND THIS GAME I LOGGED WELL OVER SEVERAL HUNDRED HOURS ON THE PC VERSION OF BCOM AND IF A BOARDGAME COULD CAPTURE THE SAME FEELING AS THAT GAME I'D BE SOLD IF IT HELPS MY GAMING GROUP IS SMALL 2 TO PLAYERS OUR PAST EXPERIENCE WITH BOARDGAMES LIKE THIS IS LIMITED SO IT'D BE A GOOD TEST TO SEE HOW QUICKLY WE COULD PICK UP AND LEARN THE RULES AND MECHANICS OF THIS GAME
I'M INTERESTED
I WOULD HAPPILY BRING THIS TO THE TABLE TO HELP OUT I HAVE A WEEKLY TABLETOP GROUP IN THE US AND COULD PROB GET THIS TESTED OUT AT ALL PLAYER COUNTS AND PLAYER LEVELS
I'D BE WILLING TO PLAY TEST IF YOU NEED MORE
US BASED IN A COLLEGE TOWN WITH GAMING GROUPS OF EXPERIENCED AND NOVICE GAMERS WOULD LOVE TO TEST AN BCOM TYPE GAME
I'D BE HAPPY TO PLATIEST WITH MY GROUP OF FRIENDS AND LIKELY 2 SONS AND

HOWEVER I THINK IT'D BE FAR MORE FRUGAL TO USE A VIRTUAL TABLETOP ENVIRONMENT YOU COULD MAKE TWEAKS AND UPDATE EVERYONE YOU DON'T NEED PHYSICAL ITEMS AND YOU DONT PAY ANY SHIPPING

EITHER THAT OR JUST DO PRINT PLAY AND HAVE PEOPLE USE COINS OR DICE AS
PM SENT
LOVE TO GIVE THIS A TRY I FOUND THE ACTUAL BCOM BOARD GAME TO BE UNDERWHELMING COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL COMPUTER GAMES WHICH I'VE PLAYED FOREVER USUALLY HAVE GROUP OF FOR GAME NIGHTS
PM SENT LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS
WOULD ALSO LOVE TO PLATIEST PM ME
THIS LOOKS INTERESTING I DO LOVE BCOM AND THE BOARD GAME OF IT IS JUST AS GREAT SIGN ME UP
WOULD LOVE TO TEST THIS WITH OUR GROUP
I SENT YOU A PM I'M DEFINITELY INTRIGUED BY THIS GAME AND WOULD LOVE TO TRY IT OUT AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK
I WOULD TOTALLY LOVE TO PLAY THIS BUT I UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO PLAY WITH
PM SENT
TO BAD IT'S US ONLY AND WILL ONLY RECEIVE A US OPINION ON GAMEPLAY
RISK HAS A BG WEIGHT OF


HERE'S ALL THE STRATEGY GAMES ON BG WITH WEIGHT COMPLEXITY FROM TO

THIS SHOULD GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE KIND OF STRATEGY GAMES OUT THERE WITH SIMILAR COMPLEXITY TO RISK
ANIS IS BARELY MORE COMPLICATED THAN RISK AND IT IS TERRIFIC
NEXUS OPS IS THE USUAL SUGGESTION FOR A DIRECT RISK REPLACEMENT THE OBJECTIVES AND DIFFERENT UNIT TYPES MAKE IT SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX
IF I WERE REPLACING RISK I'D REPLACE IT WITH MEMOIR

THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE A FOR TRADE IT JUST MEANS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY RISK BUT DON'T WANT A GAME WITH DESIGN PROBLEMS AS DATED AS RISK PLAY MEMOIR
FOR PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A GAME LIKE RISK BUT ISN'T RISK I'LL ALWAYS SUGGEST SPHERES OF INFLUENCE THIS GUY ONCE BROUGHT IT OVER AND WE BASICALLY WERE READING FROM THE RULEBOOK AS HE WAS FIGURING OUT THE GAME WHICH I ALWAYS AVOID AND EVEN WITH THAT WE MANAGED TO PLAY A PLAYER GAME IN ROUGHLY 2 HOURS THE GAME IS VERY SIMILAR TO RISK BUT IT IS SOOSOO MUCH BETTER AND ACTUALLY ENDS AT A REASONABLE TIME

NOW THAT I REMEMBER I MAY HAVE TO GRAB THIS ONE MYSELF LOL
VICTORY II IS A GOOD RISK REPLACEMENT THE MAP IS RANDOMLY GENERATED WITH HEXES WITH DIFFERENT TERRAIN IT SUPPORTS A HIGH PLAYER COUNT
RISK EUROPE IS RISK BUT WITH AUCTIONS PLANNING AND ACTION SELECTION AS WELL AS ECONOMY CONTROL SAME WEIGHT IMO BUT A WAY MORE INTERESTING EXPERIENCE
GAME OF THRONES BOARD GAME AND STAR WARS REBELLION ARE GOOD ALTERNATIVES JUST PLAYED ANIS AND IT WAS GREAT ALSO BLOOD RAGE IS WORTH A KRYM
R BOARDGAMES COMMENTS
PROSPERITY THEN SEASIDE WOULD BE MY VOTES

LOOKS LIKE AN AWESOME GAME THANKS FOR DOING THE GIVEAWAY
I GOTTA SAY THAT ART IS AMAZING I'M ALWAYS ATTRACTED TO HIGH-QUALITY ART IN GAMES AND THIS LOOKS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY
GREAT LOOKING GAME I'M AN ALL IN BACKER AND IMMEDIATELY OPEN EVERY UPDATE TO SEE WHAT NEW STUFF IS ADDED OVER VERY DETAILED MOSTLY UNIQUE MINIATURES FOR IS INCREDIBLE

I GUARANTEE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GAMES WHERE EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE POSTING ABOUT MISSING OUT ON THE KICKSTARTER AND COMPLAINING ABOUT WANTING TO BUY THE KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE FIGURES DIRECTLY FROM THEM JUST LIKE PEOPLE DO WITH BLOOD RAGE

EVERY ADDED STRETCH GOAL IS SURPASSED IMMEDIATELY I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR THIS ONE
FIRST TIME I EVER BACKED SOMETHING ON KS CREATED AN ACCOUNT JUST FOR THIS GAME RIGHT NOW MY PLEDGE IS OVER AND IT WILL PROBABLY RISE
WONDERFUL CAMPAIGN LEAD AND MANAGED BY A BUNCH OF LOVELY PEOPLE THE COMMUNITY IS GREAT TOO AND THE LIVESTREAMS ARE ALWAYS A HIGHLIGHT

IF YOU ARE AT ALL INTERESTED IN WELL DESIGNED AND HIGHLY POLISHED MINIATURE SKIRMISH GAMES THAT COME WITH MANY SCENARIOS AND CAMPAIGNS FOR UP TO PLAYERS THEN CHECK THIS OUT ESPECIALLY THE MINIS THE ONLY THING I HATE ABOUT IT IS THAT SHIPPING IS SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG WITH THIS FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS NOW AND I WANT TO BACK THIS BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST GOING TO BE A MESS OF MINIATURES I LIKE THE COMBAT RESOLUTION THE THEME AND THE DRAFTING FOR YOUR ARMY BUT WITH ALL OF THE MINIATURES IT JUST FEELS LIKE TOO MUCH IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THEIR FOCUS IS ON THE MINIS NOT ADD MUCH THE GAME
COMPETING AGAINST KD M IS A THING AT LEAST FOR ME
CAN WE DO DURING PLEDGE MANAGER
LOOKS REALLY COOL BUT NOT A FAN OF THE GRATUITOUSLY SEXY ARTWORK AND MINIATURE DETAIL THIS IS NONSENSE ONE COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT FOR CONAN BUT MONOLITH DIDN'T LEARN A THING FROM THAT DEBACLE EITHER
ALL THE KS EXCLUSIVE ADCONS ARE MAKING ME SERIOUSLY CONSIDER DROPPING MY PLEDGE THAT KIND OF BUSINESS IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO SUPPORT
THEY ARE DIFFERENT GAME EXPERIENCES

GUILD BALL IS A STREAMLINED AND FAST PACED TABLETOP MINIATURES GAME WITH A SPORTS THEME WHEN GOALS ARE SCORED THE BALL IS KICKED BACK OUT WITHOUT RESETTING THE MINIATURES IT'S A FASTER GAME AND BECAUSE IT USES ALTERNATED ACTIVATIONS YOU FEEL MORE ENGAGED BECAUSE THERE IS LESS DOWNTIME BETWEEN YOUR ACTIVE TURNS

BLOOD BOWL IS A DESIGN FROM THE AND WHILE I ENJOY IT IT FEELS LIKE A GAME FROM THE IT'S GENERALLY A SLOWER GAME AND IT'S A MY WHOLE TURN YOUR WHOLE TURN ACTIVATION IT SHINES IN MY OPINION OVER A CAMPAIGN WHERE YOU CAN GROW YOUR TEAM AGAINST OTHER TEAMS FOR LEAGUE PLAY ONE OFF GAMES ARE OK BUT LESS ENJOYABLE

BOTH ARE GOOD BUT DESPITE THEIR SIMILARITIES THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT I WOULD PROBABLY SAY I LIKE GUILD BALL BETTER
GUILD BOX IS A GREAT OFFER LOTS OF VALUE THAT WOULD COST MORE IF YOU BOUGHT ALL THE PARTS INDEPENDENTLY THE PIECES ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT ONE TYPICALLY BOUGHT PIECEMEAL IE MINIS ARE PLASTIC BOARD IS CARDBOARD BUT GUILDHALL IS A VERY STREAMLINED AND WELL DESIGNED GAME MY FAVORITE MINIS GAME RIGHT NOW
GUILDHALL ALL THE WAY I AM AN OLD BLOODBOWL PLAYER AND WHILE I GRABBED THE NEW EDITION OF BB I STILL SPEND MOST OF MY TIME PLAYING GUILD BALL THE RULESET OF BB SHOWS ITS AGE AND I GUESS IF THERE WAS NO NOSTALGIA OR WARHAMMER SETTING BEHIND IT THE GAME WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING AUDIENCE TODAY
GIVE GUILDHALL A SPIN YOU CAN PRINT OUT THE PRINT AND PLAY MATERIAL FROM THE OFFICIAL SITE AND SEE HOW IT WORKS

TL R OF PROS AND CONS

GUILDHALL

AMAZING AMAZING METAL MINIS BUT A BIT PRICEY MOST MINIS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN PLASTIC IN THE FUTURE
THE PLASTIC MINIS ARE MEDICARE BUT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO IMPROVE IN FUTURE RELEASES
FAST STREAMLINED RULESET
VERY LITTLE DOWNTIME THANKS TO ALTERNATING ACTIVATIONS
DIFFERENT CHARACTERS PLAY VERY DIFFERENTLY DUE TO THEIR PLAYBOOKS GREAT MECHANIC
GAME IS OFTEN THANKS TO ROTATING SEASONS NEW BLOODBOWL SEEMS TO BE COPYING THAT APPROACH
EVERYTHING APART FROM THE MINIS IS FREE


BLOODBOWL

NOSTALGIA
WARHAMMER
ICONIC TEAMS
NEW PLASTIC MODELS ARE GREAT AND VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY HUMANS ORCS AND SHAVEN SO FAR DWARVES COMING SOON
PRETTY STEEP LEARNING CURVE
OLD RULESET LOTS AND LOTS OF DOWNTIME
DICE ROLLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT ARE SUPER IMPORTANT AND THE GAME CAN BE VERY PUNISHING IN THE LONG RUN IT EVENS OUT FOR BOTH PLAYERS BUT IT CAN SOMETIMES FEEL THAT YOU LOST THE GAME DUE TO DICE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE NEW TO THE GAME
I'VE ORDERED BOTH THIS WEEK BUT GUILD BALL SEEMS TO BE THE BETTER GAME OVERALL BOTH IN TERMS OF VALUE AND FUN
GET A SMALL TACKLE BOX FOR THE TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES SO THAT YOU CAN PASS THAT AMOU NOWHEN PEOPLE UPGRADE


I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO BY OFF THE CUFF GAMES FOR GETTING YOUR BEARINGS



ECLIPSE IS AN AMERITRASH GAME BUILT AROUND A EURO FRAME IT'S AN ECONOMY GAME FIRST AND FOREMOST ALSO WITH PEW PEW

MANY PLAYERS COMPLAIN ABOUT PLASMA MISSILES BUT THEY ARE NEITHER BROKEN NOR OVERPOWERED IF A PLAYER IS SPENDING THEIR TIME AND RESEARCH TO GET PLASMA MISSILES ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE INSTEAD OPTED FOR IMPROVED HULL AND SHIELDS

IN FACT I RECOMMEND RESEARCHING IMPROVED HULL ASAP REGARDLESS OF WHAT RACE YOU'RE PLAYING IF IT'S AVAILABLE ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST ROUND GET IT BANKY SHIPS WITH CRAPPY GUNS OUT LAST CRAPPY SHIPS WITH CRAPPY GUNS

GOOGLE ECLIPSE TACTICAL BANKRUPTCY

DON'T BE AFRAID OF ANCIENTS A COMMON FIRST COMPLAINT FROM NEW PLAYERS IS BLAMING A BAD GAME ON LUCK OF THE DRAW FOR EXPLORATION HEXES IF YOU EXPLORE AND GET LOTS OF ANCIENTS AROUND YOU YOU MIGHT EXPAND SLOWER IN THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME BUT YOU WILL LIKELY HAVE A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE ONCE YOU START PINGING THE ANCIENTS GETTING REPUTATION TILES AND JUICY SECTORS RELATED BG LINK

THERE IS SO MUCH GOOD INFO ON BG FOR THIS GAME AND I'LL LINK IT HERE

AN ECLIPSE EXPLORATION PRIMER

AN ECLIPSE MILITARY PRIMER

AN ECLIPSE ECONOMIC PRIMER

VIRTUAL FLEETS

HOWEVER THE BEST TIP IS TO GIVE YOUR GROUP A FEW PLAYS TO EXPLORE THE DECISION SPACE FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS CHECK OUT STUFF ONLINE AND GIVE EVERYTHING A CHANCE BEFORE DRAWING QUICK CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T THIS IS A GAME WHICH FEATURES A GREAT DEAL OF STRATEGIC DEPTH AND SOME EMERGENT IT TIME TO GROW AS YOU PLAY


MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT IMPROVED HULL IS THE BEST TECHNOLOGY IN THE GAME AND YOU SHOULD NEVER PASS ON ACQUIRING IT
IMPORTANT ONE I MISSED YOU GET A VP TILE FOR EVERY COMBAT YOU DO ON A ROUND NOT JUST ONE PER ROUND
I HAVE PLAYED 2 OR TIMES AND LOVE THE GAME LAST GAME WE PLAYED WITH PEOPLE AND THE ROA EXPANSION HERE ARE THE FEW LITTLE THINGS THAT TRIPPED US UP IN THAT GAME


DICE ROLLING IN PLAYER VS PLAYER YOU ASSIGN DAMAGE TO A SHIP OF YOUR CHOICE PER CANNON DICE YOU CAN NOT SPLIT DAMAGE PER DICE EX DAMAGE TO ONE SHIP DAMAGE TO ANOTHER SHIP WITH A ANTIMATTER CANNON

ROLLING PLAYER VS ANCIENT ANCIENTS ASSIGN TO LARGEST SHIP FIRST

NO DRIVES ON STAIRCASES THEY ARE STATIONARY DEFENSE SHIPS ONLY

CAN'T COVER DRIVE ON A SHIP WITH A TECHNOLOGY UPGRADE TILE

PINNING SHIPS HAPPENS TO ADDITIONAL ONES CAN MOVE THROUGH IF YOU WANT

ROLLING AGAINST POPULATION IS A BIT DIFFERENT YOU CAN SPLIT DAMAGE FROM A CANNON EACH DAMAGE DESTROYS A CUBE

LET PEOPLE ROTATE THEIR HOME WORLD IF THE GAME IS PRESET YOU CAN ONLY MOVE AND EXPLORE CERTAIN DIRECTIONS DEPENDING ON WHICH WAY YOUR HOME TILE IS ORIENTED SIMILARLY YOU CAN MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR OTHER PLAYERS TO ADVANCE ON YOU DEPENDING ON ORIENTATION

COMPLETELY MISSED THAT EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO REMOVE POPULATION CUBE FROM A TRACK OF THEIR CHOOSING AT THE START OF THE GAME IN A PLAYER GAME
ITS BEEN A WHILE SINCE I PLAYED BUT THESE SEEMED TO BE SOME OF THE RULES THAT COME UP EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE

SHIP LOCKING IN A SYSTEM IS A RATIO BEFORE YOUR REMAINING SHIPS ARE FREE TO MOVE PAST THEM WHEN PLAYER ENTERS A SYSTEM WITH ANOTHER PLAYERS SHIPS

PLAYER STACKING IN A SYSTEM IF MULTIPLE PLAYERS ENTER THE SAME SYSTEM THE PLAYER WHO GOT THERE FIRST IS CONSIDERED THE DEFENDER PLAYER ENTERS THE SYSTEM THEN PLAYER 2 THEN PLAYER PLAYER 2 AND FIGHT EACH OTHER WITH PLAYER 2 BEING THE DEFENDER THEN WHOEVER WINS GETS TO FIGHT PLAYER WHO GOT THERE FIRST

CUBES THAT GO ON GREY RESOURCE SPOTS WHEN THEY WOULD GO BACK TO YOUR SUPPLY FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU CAN PICK IF THEY GO TO MONEY OR SCIENCE SEE BELOW

RULES IF A CUBE IS RETURNED FROM A GRAY WILD SQUARE YOU MAY CHOOSE WHICH TRACK IT GOES TO SIMILARLY IF A CUBE IS RETURNED FROM AN ORBITAL YOU MAY RETURN IT TO EITHER THE MONEY OR SCIENCE TRACK

BG FAQ
HERE IS SOMETHING I FOUND WHEN I STARTED PLAYING TO HELP QUICKLY TEACH OTHEREST HOW TO PLAY
R BOARDGAMES COMMENTS

IF YOU WANT A NICE QUICK START STORAGE SET
PRODUCT

AND WHILE IS MAY BE OVERKILL THE CUBE TRAYS ARE NICE FOR KEEPING THINGS FROM SCATTERING WHEN THINGS GET BUMPED

YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DISK IN THE SECTOR BEFORE PUTTING CUBES DOWN

TECH ARE WHAT YOU RESEARCH THEN YOU UPGRADE THEM ONTO SHIPS SEPARATELY TECH HAS A CHIP ON THE SIDE AND STAYS ON THE TREE BRANCH

RETREATING IS AN OPTION THAT IS USUALLY GLOSSED OVER IT'D APPLY TO ALL GROUPS OF THE SAME CLASS DURING COMBAT

MONEY IS IMPORTANT AS A RESOURCE IT ISN'T AS COOL AS BUILDING THINGS OR RESEARCHING BUT IT IS NECESSARY

HOUSE RULE FOR THE FIRST SECTOR YOU EXPLORE I DO A ONE 2 STARTING WITH 2 INTERCEPTORS HELPS SPEED UP THE GAME
MISSILES ONLY MISSILES
IGNORE THE SUGGESTION IN THE RULEBOOK THAT EVERYONE PLAY AS HUMANS THE FIRST GAME ALLOW PEOPLE TO PICK BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES FOR THEIR FIRST PLAYTHROUGH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPECIES ARE WHAT MAKE THIS GAME INTERESTING AND IT MIGHT SEEM BORING AT FIRST IF EVERYONE'S THE SAME

THAT SAID THE RED PLAYER MAY VERY WELL WANT THE HUMANS ERIDANI EMPIRE IS A TOUGH ONE TO PLAY FOR YOUR FIRST GAME
GO BUY IT ON STEAM ITS SUPER FUN TO PLAY AGAINST THE AI AND REALLY GIVES YOU A GREAT UNDERSTANDING ON HOW THE MECHANISMS WORK TOGETHER IN A REAL LIFE GAME
SINCE MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE RULES COVERED ONE STRATEGY TIP IS DON'T NEGLECT YOUR ECONOMY BUILDING A HUGE FLEET AND FIGHTING IS AWESOME BUT IF YOU RUSH IT AND HAPPEN TO LOSE YOUR FLEET YOU ARE IN FOR A BAD TIME
SHIP PARTS FIT PERFECT IN A GMT COUNTER TRAY YOU'RE WELCOME
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW GAMES WHERE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE EXPANSION AS THE DEFAULT WAY TO PLAY

IT TRIES TO ADDRESS THE UPNESS OF MISSELS
IT GIVES YOU ALIEN SHIPS TO FILL IN THE EMPTY STARTER SPACES WHEN PLAYING WITH WEIRD PLAYER COUNTS SUCH AS OR PLAYERS
IT GIVES YOU MORE RACES COLORS
IT GIVES YOU AN AWESOME ALTERNATE VARIANT WHICH LETS THE SECOND PLAYER TO PASS DECIDE THE TURN ORDER OF THE NEXT ROUND
IT GIVES A BUNCH OF OTHER OPTION RULES TILES POWERS TO PLAY WITH SUCH AS WARP POINTS WHICH REALLY OPEN UP THE BOARD AND HELP PREVENT COMPLETE TURTLING

ALSO DEFINITELY INVEST IN A WAY TO SET UP THE GAME FASTER PEOPLE RECOMMENDING FOAMCORE OR TACKLE BOXES IT'S A MUST FOR THIS GAME
ITS A VIABLE STRATEGY TO GO BANKRUPT I E NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR UPKEEP AND THEN UNINFLUENCED TILES TO RETURN DISKS TO YOUR TRACK

ALSO SOME NEW PLAYERS MISS THAT YOU PUT ALL YOUR INCOME ON FIRST BEFORE PAYING FOR WHAT YOU'VE USED
MISSILES ARE BROKEN
MISSILES ARE OP EITHER DO RESEARCH TO BALANCE THEM OR EXPLOIT THE HELL OUT OF IT AND MAKE EVERYONE RAGE QUIT
HEY I'M JUSTIN JOHN AND I CREATED THE CONTENDER IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS FEEL FREE TO ASK AWAY
HUGE FAN OF THIS GAME AND I'VE BOUGHT ALL THE EXPANSIONS MY FRIENDS LOVE IT TOO BUT UNFORTUNATELY BY ME HAVING IT THEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO BUY THEIR OWN COPY

I THINK THE MOMENTUM OF THE CONTENDER IS GOING TO RUN OUT THE FURTHER AWAY WE GET FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
FIND IT ODD THAT SEEMS THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE LATCHING ONTO IS THEY SCREWED UP NOT GOING TO CHINA WHILE IT WAS A FACTOR I DON'T THINK CHINA WOULD HAVE SOLVED THERE INITIAL KS PROBLEMS AS SOMEBODY WHO DEALS WITH CHINESE COMPANIES EVERYDAY I CAN TELL YOU THEY HAVE THERE WHOLE SET OF ANNOYING ISSUES THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THEM ALMOST AS MANY PROBLEMS EVERY CHINESE COMPANY I'VE DEALT WITH WILL AGREE WITH YOU ON ALMOST ANY DELIVERY YOU ASK EVEN IF THEY KNOW IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE AND THEY HATE GIVING YOU BAD NEWS SO THEY PUT IT OFF UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT WHEN YOU ARE USUALLY COMPLETELY SCREWED BUT HAD THEY TOLD YOU WHEN THEY FIRST KNEW YOU COULD HAVE DONE DAMAGE CONTROL THE ONLY WAY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MINIMIZE THE SCREW UPS IS BY HAVING INDEPENDENT STAFF ON OUR PAYROLL CAMPED OUT IN OUR SUPPLIERS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING A SMALL START-UP COULD AFFORD


THANKS FOR THE VALUABLE INSIGHT ON CREATING YOUR OWN GAME THESE ARE THE KIND OF LESSONS YOU EITHER LEARN THE HARD WAY OR YOU GET SUPER LUCKY AND HAVE SOMEONE SHARE THE RESULTS WITH YOU

I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER KICKSTARTER I SAW RECENTLY THE NEW KINGDOM MONSTER AND HOW IT HAS RAISED MILLION DOLLARS INSTEAD OF THE HE WAS HOPING FOR AND HOW HE'S POSSIBLY GOING TO MANAGE THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT

I'M CURIOUS IF YOU'RE GUNG-HO FOR GOING AT THIS AGAIN WITH THE NEXT GAME WITH YOUR NEW FOUND EXPERIENCE


MY FRIEND AN I HAD A SUCCESSFUL KICKSTARTER AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER WITH ORDERS FOR ABOUT UNITS WE KICKSTARTED ENOUGH TO BREAK EVEN IF WE PURCHASE UNITS FROM CHINA

WE HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE SOON ORDER COPIES SELL HALF AND BREAK EVEN AND THEN SELL THE REST OR ORDER COPIES FOR MORE AT A REASONABLE INITIAL LOSS

OUR PROTOTYPE SHOWS UP IN A FEW DAYS WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN EASY DECISION IS A BIT TOUGHER NOW
REALLY FASCINATING ARTICLE THANK YOU FOR WRITING IT UP AND FOR BEING SO HONEST ABOUT STUFF
KNOW THE FEELING BUT ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE WE RAISED FOR OUR POLITICAL GAME BACK IN FEBRUARY WITH JUST OVER KICKSTARTER ORDERS SO WE ORDERED AND PUT THE REST ON AMAZON FUNNY ENOUGH SALES PICKED UP DRAMATICALLY AFTER THE ELECTION WHEREAS WE THOUGHT IT WAS MAKE OR BREAK PRE-ELECTION WE BASICALLY BROKE EVEN AFTER ELECTION DAY NOW COPIES LEFT PROBABLY HELPED THAT THE ONLY CANDIDATE WE DIRECTLY PARODIED IN THE GAME TRUMP WENT ON TO WIN THE WHOLE THING NOW IT LOOKS MORE PROPHETIC AND APPROPRIATELY CYNICAL

CAN CONFIRM THAT AMAZON ADVERTISING WORKS GREAT THOUGH IT EATS LOTS OF MARGIN OUR BLACK FRIDAY CYBER MONDAY SALE ALSO CAME THROUGH BIG TIME
TURNS OUT KICKSTARTER IS A MAGICAL FANTASY LAND WHERE PEOPLE GET EXCITED ABOUT YOUR STUFF IN A WAY THAT DOESN T TRANSLATE INTO YOUR SMALL BUSINESS

THIS REMINDS ME OF THE EARLY DAYS OF EBAY EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT THE BUSINESS MODEL WAS SO GOOD THAT EVERY SALE WAS A DEAL TURNS OUT THE MODEL WORKS REALLY WELL FOR THE WEBSITE AND NOT SO WELL FOR MANY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS KS WILL REACH THAT POINT TOO
BUMMER IT DIDN'T GO AS WELL AS YOU'D HOPED HOPE THE FUTURE IS BRIGHTER
AN EXCELLENT AND VERY IMPORTANT READ FOR ME AS MY KICKSTARTER IS JUST ABOUT TO END IN A FEW DAYS
I THINK I KNOW THAT PRINT COMPANY YOU USED I'VE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE I'VE DONE ABOUT PRINT RUNS AND THAT WAS MY MOST FRUSTRATING ONE TO DATE
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS THAT PRINTING IN THE US WAS BY FAR THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THIS IS A GLOBAL ECONOMY NOBODY CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT COUNTRY OF ORIGIN ANYMORE
SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO DO A MASS DONATION TO SCHOOLS CHARITIES FOR MOST OF THOSE ASSUMING YOU HAVE MADE ENOUGH MONEY SO FAR TO NEED THE WRITEOFF
DON'T ORDER TOO MANY COPIES SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE THE MANTRA OF EVERY KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN
I'M GLAD YOU'VE MANAGED TO BREAK EVENING EVEN IF SOUNDS LIKE A ROUGH PATCH YOU'VE COME OUT OF IT OK AND WITH IMPORTANT BUSINESS LESSONS LEARNED NOT EVERYONE CAN MAKE THOSE CLAIMS

BTW ARE YOU SHIPPING ONLY FROM INSIDE US OR DO YOU HAVE STOCK AT INTERNATIONAL AMAZON LOCATIONS TOO IT SOUNDS LIKE A GAME THAT WOULD GO OVER VERY WELL WITH MY GAME GROUP BUT WITH THE PRICE ALREADY AS IS IF I HAD TO IMPORT IT AND PAY TAXES ON IT JUST WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT ANYMORE
THE GAME IS INTERESTING TO ME BUT STILL TOO MUCH FOR ME TO BUY THAT SAID I'M INTERESTED IN FUTURE SALES SO I TRIED TO SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR PAGE FOR UPDATES BUT THE EMAIL SUBSCRIBER TOOK ME TO A PAGE

JUST FYI
SETTING UP YOUR OWN DISTRIBUTION CENTER MAY BE CHEAPER THAN AMAZON ESPECIALLY WITH THE CRAZY ASS PRICE INCREASE THEY JUST HAD

A STORAGE LOCKER PALPAL WOODCOC AND SHIPSTATION WITH A USPS OR UPS ACCOUNT AND YOU CAN DISTRIBUTE MUCH CHEAPER THAN AMAZON

I RUN SHIPMENTS A DAY WITH A STAFF OF USING THE ABOVE SYSTEM
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE IN MY KS RANTS BUT WHAT'S CRAZY TO ME IS THE SAME MISTAKES HAPPEN OVER AND OVER BUT THEY KEEP HAPPENING HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE LET'S SAY NOBODY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD EVER EXPLAINED HOW MUCH STORING ITEMS FOR AMAZON FULFILLMENT SERVICES COSTS LET'S SAY THIS DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE EVEN FROM AMAZON THEMSELVES NOW THAT THIS MEDIUM POST WAS PUBLISHED DO YOU THINK A FUTURE BOARD GAME KICKSTARTER WILL HAVE AN ISSUE WITH COMING UP WITH MONEY TO PAY FOR THE AMAZON STORAGE COSTS YES PROBABLY

WHAT ABOUT OTHER COMMON KS LESSONS HOW ABOUT THE LUNAR CHINESE NEW YEAR SHUTDOWN OR THE COST OF SHIPPING AROUND THE WORLD OR THE SPEED AT WHICH SHIPS FROM CHINA TAKE TO REACH AMERICA OR THICKER CARDBOARD EQUALS HEAVIER BOX

I LIKE KS AS A PLATFORM FOR NEW ENTREPRENEURS TO LEARN THE ROPES BUT LEARN NEW LESSONS LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER A BUSINESS PLAN OR PITCHING YOUR IDEAS TO INVESTORS OR TEACHING YOURSELF ILLUSTRATOR TO GREAT A LOGO OR GRAPHICS FOR YOUR GAME I DON'T WANT KS TO BE USED TO LEARN THE SAME LESSON MISTAKE THAT IS LITERALLY DONE OVER AND OVER
READ TO QUESTION ONE THOUGHT TO MYSELF YOU CHOSE USA INSTEAD OF CHINA DIDN'T YOU

KEEPS ON READING

YEP THAT EXPLAINS IT
I KNOW I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GET DOWNVOTED FOR THIS AND I DESERVE IT BUT AM I THE ONLY ONE TIRED OF CH CLONES NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME HOW EVEN STRAIGHT UP RIP OFFS WITH SIMILAR SOUNDING NAMES MANAGE POSITIVE REVIEWS IN AMAZON AND PUT OUT EXPANSIONS THIS ONE EVEN RAUNCHIER AT LEAST THIS ONE IS AN SOMEWHAT ORIGINAL TAKE ON THE CONCEPT

THAT SAID THE POST IS GREAT AND EVEN IF IT IS MARKETING AND IT IS THAT I WISH ALL MARKETING WAS LIKE THAT
IS THE NEWS FOR ME YES SIR GOT IT GOING RIGHT THERE WITH A JUSTIN IN A INESITE AND A PARROT LOOKING FLY ITS TIME FOR A SALUTE AS WE WATCH IT ALL DIE IM GONNA CRY THOUGHT I HAD A SOCIALIST GUY WITH DEMOCRATIC TENDENCIES BUT REALLY JUST THE DNC PLAYING WITH MY HEART STRINGS AND NOW WE GOT SOME REAL THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT CAUSE WE'RE OUT OF TIME FOR THE ARC AND THE ONLY LIGHT IN FRONT OF ME IS THE FACE OF A TRAIN WILL IT RUN ME OVER CAUSE ME PAIN I DON'T KNOW TIME TO WAIT AND SEE FOR THE MAN WHO DISGUSTS ME WHAT WILL HIS POLICY BE ON DEMOCRACY PLEASE INCLUDE WE THE PEOPLE NOT JUST THE FEW OR THE EVIL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOU KEPT ME ENTERTAINED NOW YOUR INSANITY KEEPS ME SANE I HAVE YOU TO BLAME FOR SOME GOOD LAUGHS AND A GREAT GAME I HOPE YOU RISE EVEN FURTHER INTO FAME BECAUSE YOUR DEBT AND LOSS HAS BEEN MY SINCERE GAIN THANKS ALL THE SAME
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PODCASTERS ON MY FAVORITE SUBREDDIT TRULY THE END TIMES

FWIW PEOPLE THE CONTENDER WAS JUST AS FUN THIS PAST WEEKEND AS IT WAS DURING THE ELECTION CYCLE I BOUGHT THE BASE GAME AND THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT EXPANSION AND PROBABLY THE ONLY PARTY GAME THAT GETS MORE TABLE TIME IS SECRET HITLER
WE'VE HAD SEVERAL ARTICLES WITH THE COST OF KS BUT THIS WAS REALLY EXCELLENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT MARKETING AVENUES AVAILABLE FOR KS AND HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE
AS SOMEONE WHO USED TO WORK IN THE PRINTING INDUSTRY TWO FUCKING WEEKS FOR PROOFS WTF

SOUNDS LIKE THEIR PROBLEM WAS THEIR SALES REP THOUGHT THEY WERE SMALL POTATOES AND NOT REALLY TAKING CARE OF THEM OR THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE THOUGHT THEY WERE UNIMPORTANT AND DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THEM

IT SHOULD NEVER TAKE MORE THAN HOURS TO GET PROOFS FROM ANY CREDIBLE PRINTING COMPANY THAT HANDLES PREPREGS IN HOUSE
THIS IS WHY I ALWAYS FIND IT FUNNY WHEN PEOPLE ASSUME THAT A COMPANY IS RICH AFTER THEIR KICKSTARTER IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU RAISED OR THERE ARE A TON OF COSTS IN REGARDS TO FULFILLMENT BEFORE ANYONE SEES ANY PROFIT I'M ALWAYS SURPRISED WHEN SOME COMPANIES CAN DO THIS AS A LIVING BECAUSE I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING BIG PROFITS COMING OUT OF BOARD GAMES I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL DO THIS AS A SIDE JOB EVEN SUCCESSFUL DESIGNERS

I WILL BE BUYING SEVERAL COPIES OF THIS GAME THIS IS A GREAT ARTICLE AND PEPPER WHO MAKE GAMES LIKE THIS DESERVE TO BE REWARDED WITH A LOT OF MONEY FOR THEIR EFFORTS CHEERS MATE
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED TO TRANSLATE THE GAME IN OTHER LANGUAGES
LIKED THE STOREY LIKED THE LOOK OF THE GAME WANTED TO BUY IT BUT IT COST ME TO JUST GET IT POSTED TO AUSTRALIA IF THERE WAS A REASONABLE PRICE TO GET IT HERE I WOULD BUY IT


VERY NICE READ THANKS FOR POSTING AND BEST OF LUCK WITH YOUR BUSINESS VENTURE
U JOHNTEASDALE

HI

I ACTUALLY REMEMBER YOUR GAME WAS IN A SAVE MONEY MODE THOUGH AND DIDN'T END UP GETTING IT SORRY WILL BE LOOKING AT YOUR WEBSITE LATER TODAY

I HAD A QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE DONE OTHER BOARD GAME LAUNCHES BEFORE FROM YOUR ARTICLE DID THEY GO BETTER OR WORSE THEN THIS ONE AND DO YOU FEEL THAT THE PREVIOUS LAUNCHES HAD IN RETROSPECT GIVEN YOU ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO DEAL WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND LAUNCH

DO YOU FEEL THE CONTENT OF THE GAME MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH SALES YOU HAD A FEW THINGS GOING AGAINST IT PERHAPS A DICEY POLITICAL CYCLE SOME SAY A CH TYPE GAME BEING AMERICAN FLAVORED VS SOMETHING LETS SAY EUROPE COULD FEEL OK WITH

THANKS FOR YOUR TIME
SORRY IF THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED BUT ON YOUR WEBSITE I CAN'T TELL IF THE THE CONTENDER HOLIDAY SPECIAL HAS ALL OF THE EXPANSIONS OR NOT DOES IT INCLUDE THE BATTLE FOR NEW YORK BATTLE FOR STREET LOUIS BATTLE FOR LAS VEGAS

ALSO ARE YOU REALLY A PATRIOT WHO GIVES A DAMN
THANKS FOR WRITING THIS UP GUYS I HAVE TWO QUICK QUESTIONS

I'M IN THE UK DO YOU KNOW IF THE BEST WAY TO GET YOUR GAME BUYING DIRECT FROM YOU HAS COPY AND IT'S

2 IF I'M BUYING ON YOUR WEBSITE AND GRAB THE HOLIDAY SPECIAL BUNDLE DO I ONLY NEED TO ADD THE TV AND MOVIE EXPANSION TO IT TO HAVE EVERYTHING
AS A KICKSTARTER BACKER OF THE CONTENDER I WISH YOU GUYS WELL WITH THIS ISSUE I'VE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS GAME AND IF I KNEW PEOPLE I'D FORCE THEM TO BUY IT ALSO
JUST ONE OTHER THING FOR THE CREATORS OF THE CONTENDER TO CONSIDER PINGING U JOHNTEASDALE U JUSTINRYOUNG AND ANY OTHER EMPLOYEES IN THE THREAD IN ADDITION

I AS A PERSON IN DENMARK CANNOT BUY YOUR GAME FROM AMAZON YOUR GAME SIMPLY DOES NOT SHIP TO DENMARK EITHER FROM THE UK OR US VERSION OF THE GAME IT'S NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE GERMAN AMAZON UNLESS I WANT TO PAY SOME SCUMMY RESELLER OVER EURO FOR THE GAME

I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ORDER THE GAME FROM YOUR OWN WEBSITE I HAVEN'T CHECKED THAT YET BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO BUY IT FROM AMAZON IS A PITA

I NOTICE THAT THE STANDARD STANDARD NSF VERSION OF YOUR GAME WAS AVAILABLE WORLDWIDE THROUGH YOUR KICKSTARTER BUT NOT ANY OF THE FANCIER VERSIONS I'LL BE HONEST THAT'S KIND OF A TO ME AS AN INTERNATIONAL BACKER TOO
FROM READING THIS IT SOUNDS LIKE RUSHED THROUGH THIS HOPING TO MAKE SOME EASY CASH AND DIDN'T TAKE THE TIME TO HAVE A COMPLETE GAME PLAN BEFORE YOU EVEN STARTED THE KICKSTARTER
ALL FOUR COLORS ARE EQUIVALENT NONE OF THEM ARE HARDER OR EASIER THAN THE OTHERS NOR MORE LIKELY TO BE CODA CURRENTLY ON MY SECOND PLAY THROUGH BOUGHT IT AGAIN TO SHARE WITH DIFFERENT GROUP HAD BLUE THE FIRST TIME AND BLACK THIS TIME
OURS WAS RED I THINK THERE'S THE SAME NUMBER OF CITIES AND SIMILAR CONNECTIONS AS YELLOW
I'VE PLAYED TWO CAMPAIGNS ONE WAS BLACK ONE RED I THINK NEITHER WAS HARDER THAN THE OTHER I SPECULATE THAT YELLOW WOULD BE THE WORST
OURS WAS YELLOW BECAUSE WE GENERALLY NEGLECT YELLOW IN PANDEMIC

I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST SINCE A LARGE PORTION OF YELLOW IS LESS IN LINE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD WHICH RESULTED IN OUR ENTIRE SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA BEING A MESS BY THE END OF DECEMBER I COULD SEE THOUGH HOW HAVING THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE MAP DISRUPTED COULD MAKE IT HARDER ESPECIALLY WITH THE POTENTIAL SPREADING INTO OTHER COLORS THAT COULD OCCUR
OURS WAS YELLOW BUT I THINK IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE SHOULDN'T BE MORE LIKELY THAN ANY OTHER COLOR
I REALLY ENJOY IT MY WIFE LOVES THE LEGENDARY GAMES BUT SINCE GETTING XENOSHYFT IT'S BASICALLY REPLACED LEGENDARY FOR US
I HAVE THE GAME IT'S PRETTY EASY TO TEACH BUT HARD TO WIN TEAMWORK IS IMPORTANT BUT IT ALSO FEELS LIKE YOU'RE EACH PLAYING YOUR OWN GAME I LIKE THE GAME BUT IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE CHECK OUT A GAMEPLAY VIDEO IF YOU STILL WANT TO GET IT
I WOULD SAY THE GAME IS FAIRLY EASY TO TEACH BUT THERE ARE SOME MINOR AMBIGUITIES IN REGARD TO CARD PLAY AND TIMING THAT YOU MAY NEED LO LOOK UP CLARIFICATIONS ON SPECIFICALLY IN REGARD TO PLAYING ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO REVEAL EFFECTS

I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS FAIR BUT CERTAIN ITEM CARD SETUPS WILL DEFINITELY WORK BETTER THAN OTHERS PART OF PREDICTING WHAT TO DO IN ANY GIVEN GAME IS GOING TO RELY ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CARDS AND THEIR EFFECTS BUT THIS IS TRUE FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF GAMES I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND PLAYING THE VARIANT UPDATED RULES THAT HAVE YOU PLAY THREE ALIEN CARDS PER ROW ON ROUNDS AND FOUR CARDS ON ROUNDS AND AND FOUR CARDS WITH A BOSS SHUFFLED IN FOR ROUNDS AND THIS ENSURES YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM AS YOU JUMP UP TO THE NEXT WAVE OF ENEMIES AND BUILDS UP THE DIFFICULTY WITH EACH WAVE THE RULES AS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK COULD RESULT IN YOUR MEAGER ARMY HAVING TO FACE OFF AGAINST A BOSS ENEMY RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE WHICH I WOULD ARGUE IS NOT FAIR OR PARTICULARLY FUN

AS WITH ALL GAMES OF THIS TYPE QUARTERBACKING IS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM BUT AS OTHERS HAVE ARGUED ELSEWHERE THIS IS ULTIMATELY A PLAYER PROBLEM NOT A GAME PROBLEM I FIND THE COOPERATIVE NATURE OF THIS GAME TO BE A BIT STRONGER THAN IN OTHERS BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY CARDS ON ANY PLAYER'S ROW IN AN EFFORT TO HELP THEM

THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE THEME BUT I REALIZE IT IS NOT A GAME FOR EVERYONE AND I DO FIND THE GAME RUNS A LITTLE LONG FOR WHAT IT IS
I PERSONALLY DON'T RECOMMEND IT IT IS BASICALLY A SOLITAIRE GAME THAT YOUR FRIENDS PLAY AT THE SAME TIME

IF YOU WANT A COOP DECK BUILDER LOOK AT THE LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS GAMES
HAS SOME GOOD IDEAS BUT ULTIMATELY EXTREMELY SLOW AND CLUNKY HOPING THE NEXT GAME WILL FIX THINGS
THE APP IS FUN NO WAY I WOULD PAY FULL PRICE FOR A SIMPLE CARD GAME THIS GAME AS IT IS IS OVER PRICED AND OVER PRODUCED SHOULD BE DOLLARS AND IT WOLF BE AMAZING
A FEW PEOPLE AT BG ARE SAYING THEIR ORDERS ARE ARRIVING WITHOUT ANY NOTIFICATION FROM FFA WHILE OTHERS ARE STARTING TO RECEIVE SHIPPING NOTICES

THREAD PAGE
DIDN'T EVEN GET AN EMAIL SAYING THE ORDER WAS PROCESSED YET
SAME ISSUE DIDN'T SEE YOUR POST AND I HAD JUST POSTED ABOUT THIS I ORDERED NOV RECEIVED CONFIRMATION OF ORDER AND NOTHING ELSE I'VE EMAILED BUT ONLY GOT A CANNED RESPONSE
THERE'S BEEN A FEW THREADS IN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS ABOUT THIS

OP DISCLOSURE

MY GAME FOG OF LOVE IS MENTIONED AND I'M F G PROUD


FOG OF LOVE IS MY NUMBER ONE GAME BY SUCH A WIDE MARGIN THAT IT'S FRANKLY A LITTLE RIDICULOUS


I LOVE YOU TOO TOM
THANKS FOR THE REPORT REALLY INTERESTED IN TRYING THIS ONE DO YOU FEEL IT WILL HOLD UP AFTER MULTIPLE PLAYS IS THERE A RANDOM SET-UP THAT MAKES EACH GAME UNIQUE


I'M SO SALTY THAT THIS RAN OUT OF STOCK ON CSI WHILE IT SAT IN MY CART WAITING FOR THEIR SALE SHENANIGANS WANT IT SO BAD
I HADN'T HEARD OF THIS GAME BEFORE SOUNDS RAD I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR IT THANK YOU FOR POSTING
I CAN'T WAIT FOR MY COPY TO BE DELIVERED I'VE GOT MY PLAYGROUND EXCITED FOR THIS GAME AS WELL IT'S GOING TO BE OUR FIRST COOP EXPERIENCE
REVIEWS SAY THAT IT'S A LOT OF COLLECT AND DELIVER FOR GAMEPLAY HOW WOULD YOU SAY THAT IT IS OR ISN'T
YEAH I JUST MAY HAVE TO GIVE THIS ONE A GO IT CERTAINLY IS VERY DARK AND SEEMINGLY INTENSE WHICH I ABSOLUTELY ADORE ON PRINCIPLE ALONE

THANKS FOR THE POSTING AND COMMENTARIES ON YOUR TWO ROUNDS OF IT
I HOPE TO PLAY THIS SOON
DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THE LONGEVITY OF A COOP YOU BEAT ON YOUR SECOND ATTEMPT
PARADOX
I WONDER IF YOU COULD TURN COH INTO A DECK BUILDER
BEFORE CODENAMES BECAME WIDELY AVAILABLE I USED THE CARDS FROM SNAKE OIL ALONG WITH POKER CHIPS AND THE CODENAMES APPARENTLY
MARIO CHESS IT'S GOT SOME REALLY COOL MINIS THAT I'VE REUSED INTO A MARIO THEMED KING OF TOKYO
NOT A PERFECT EXAMPLE BECAUSE I LIKE BOTH GAMES BUT I CAN PLAY BATTLE LINE WITH MY PARADE DECK JUST REMOVE THE AND ADD SOME MARKERS TOKENS FOR FLAGS
GREENHOUSE CAN BE SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED HERE AS BY THE SAME DESIGNER AS FLUX

THE PLASTIC PYRAMIDS FROM MULTIPLE COPIES OF GREENHOUSE CAN BE USED TO PLAY A MUCH BETTER GAME ZENDO ZENDO IS A GAME OF LOGIC WHERE PLAYERS ARE TRYING TO GUESS THE RULE


I REPURPOSED THE MINIATURES FROM RISK LEGACY FOR USE IN MY OLD EL GRANDE SET
MTG ARENA OF THE PLANESWALKERS HAS A BOATLOAD OF MINIATURES AT AN INSANELY LOW PRICE I GOT MY COPY FOR NOW I CAN PROTOTYPE ALL SORTS OF GAME PIECES
ARCADIA QUEST INFERNO IS A STAND ALONE GAME WITH NEW TILES GEAR HEROES ETC WITH THE ADDED MECHANISMS OF DAMNATION ANGELS AND CHANGES TO THE CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

ARCADIA QUEST IS A GREAT GAME THAT I LOVE I PERSONALLY ONLY OWN THE STANDARD RETAIL VERSION WITH NO EXPANSIONS OR KICKSTARTER EXTRAS AND I STILL LOVE IT I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT THIS KIND OF GAME WOULD APPEAL TO AND WOULD NOT LET COMO DISSUADE THEM

LAST UPDATE FOR INFERNO IS THAT IT SHOULD BE GETTING TO BACKERS BY JANUARY NOT SURE HOW MUCH LONGER UNTIL RETAIL

AT THIS POINT I GUESS YOU COULD WAIT

I THINK YOU SHOULD BUY BOTH YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH HEROES AND THEY WROTE ANOTHER CAMPAIGN THAT COMBINES THE TWO SETS
AH I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ABOUT ANOTHER CAMPAIGN WHICH MIXES BOTH THAT SETTLES IT THEN WILL BUY AQ AND THEN ABI LATER
AQ IS AMAZING AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES IT NEAR PERFECTLY CAPTURES THE BRAWL FEELING AND GETTING LOOK IS AMAZING IT'S HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE DICE CHUCKER I OWN THE RETAIL BASE GAME AND THE RETAIL BEYOND THE GRAVE BEYOND THE GRAVE IS VERY CLOSE TO THE PERFECT EXPANSION IN MY MIND IT OFFERS MORE OF THE SAME GREATNESS BUT DEEPER MECHANICS AND REALLY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM THEY HAVE BUILT IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE TO PLAY IT WITH YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH AQ

I AM ALSO ALL IN ON AQ I AND IT LOOKS SIMILAR TO BEYOND BUT MIGHT BE TRYING A LITTLE TO HARD WITH THE NEW MECHANICS I DON'T DOUBT IT WILL BE AMAZING PLUS ADDING AN ENTIRE CAMPAIGN BRIDGING THE TWO BASE GAMES ADDS MORE THAN ENOUGH EXTRA FLAVOR PEOPLE OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT HERO VARIETY BUT RGT NOW I OWN IN THE BASE AND 2 IN BEYOND AND ITS A BLAST IT LETS YOU GET VERY FAMILIAR WITH CHARACTER AND TRY OUT FUN SYNERGIES I PREDICT IT WILL BE KIND OF A SHIT SHOW WHEN THE BASTILLION EXTRA CHARACTERS COME IN WITH AQ I PLUS IF YOU REALLY NEED EXTRA HEROES THEY HAVE ALL THE CHARACTER CARDS ON THE WEBSITE YOU CAN JUST PRINT OUT AND USE PROXIES

THE ONLY COOL THING ABOUT AQ I THAT IS REALLY UNIQUE ARE THE DRAGONS NORMALLY AFTER THE 6TH MISSION A WINNER IS CROWNED AND YOU CAN START A NEW CAMPAIGN WITH THE AQ I KICK STARTER THEY INTRODUCED NEW HUGE DRAGONS THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT IN A 7TH SCENARIO WHERE IT IS FULLY CO-OP BETWEEN ALL THE GUILDS TO KILL A GIANT DRAGON THESE ARE NOT UNIQUE TO THE AND YOU CAN GET THEM AT RETAIL


TL R AQ EVEN JUST THE BASE GAME IS AMAZING GET IT AND PLAY IT IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH IT THERE IS SO MUCH EXTRA CONTENT YOU CAN PICK UP LATER
IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO START PLAYING AQ THEN GO GET AQ NOW YOU'LL WANT AQ I AFTER YOU PLAY AQ
ITS A STANDALONE EXPANSION FROM WHAT I READ

YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO WAIT FOR A WHILE TO ACQUIRE IT IT BUILDS UPON A FEW THINGS FROM THE BASE GAME SO I GUESS ITS A MATTER OF YOUR TASTES I JUST GOT AQ BY TRADE AND I AM EXCITED AF
WAIT FOR THE INFERNO IT'S THE SAME GAME WITH SOME ADDED MECHANISMS IF YOU GET THE FIRST AQ YOU MIGHT NEED TO SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE INFERNO AFTERWARDS
I AM CURRENTLY DEPLOYED OVERSEAS AS WELL SOME COMPACT GAMES THAT WE ENJOY ARE

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF

RESISTANCE AVALON

STAR REALMS

BANG THE DICE GAME

PANDEMIC

CUTTHROAT CAVERNS

THE GRIZZLED

THE MANHATTAN PROJECT

SOME GAMES BUT FUN

ELDRITCH HORROR

COSMIC ENCOUNTER

AGRICOLA

LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL


WHEN I WORKED AT A FAGS THE OWNER WOULD SEND HIS OVERSTOCK OF CCDS AND OTHER CARD GAMES TO CUSTOMERS WHO WERE DEPLOYED AND THEY REALLY LIKED THEM THESE GUYS WERE ARMY SO ANYTHING WITH ONLY CARDS WAS GREAT SINCE THEY WERE LIVING IN TENTS AND MOVING AROUND A LOT
COUP WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD CHOICE OR ANY OF THE VAST ARRAY OF SMALL CARD GAMES OUT THERE CODENAMES SHOULD BE GOOD AS WELL
MY EXPERIENCE WAS THAT PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY LIKED MAGIC THE GATHERING A LOT BECAUSE THEY COULD RELIABLY FIND PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH NO MATTER WHERE THEY WERE STATIONED DEPLOYED THE NEW DECKS ARE BALANCED AND PRETTY WELL BUILT SO A FEW OF THOSE WOULD LET MULTIPLE PEOPLE PLAY AND GIVE THE FUN OF DECKBUILDING ETC
NOBODY ELSE HAS MENTIONED IT BUT MY VOTE IS FOR SKULL ONCE HE'S PLAYED IT ONCE OR TWICE IT CAN BE EASILY MADE FROM ANY DECK OF CARDS

THE ART IS COOL AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH COMPONENTS TO SCARE OFF THE CORE MECHANIC IS APPROACHABLE BY POKER PLAYERS WHICH I'M SURE ALL OF HIS ARMY BUDDIES ARE BUT THE GAME IS FAST AND SMALL ENOUGH PLAY ANYWHERE
CODENAMES AND RESISTANCE ARE HUGE HITS ON MY SHIP ESPECIALLY WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T PLAY BOARD GAMES NORMAL
HIVE POCKET
SO I'M THINKING THESE SHOULD BE THE CRITERIA

SMALL VOLUME ONCE YOU THROW THE BOX AWAY
ACCOMODATE A VARIABLE PLAYER COUNT
HIGH REPLAY ABILITY
CHANCE TO DEVELOP SOME SORT OF META AS I EXPECT IT WILL GET PLAYED OVER AND OVER AGAIN

WITH THESE IN MIND I'D LIKE TO RECOMMEND LIBERALIA
THE WHOLE GAME IS CARDS AND A BAG OF CHITS THE BOARDS ARE A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THE SIZE OF THE BOX BUT THEY'RE TOTALLY UNNECESSARY REALLY
THE GAME PLAYS AND DOES SO WELL AT ALL COUNTS A SMALL GAME IS VERY CEREBRAL WHILE A LARGE GAME IS CHAOTIC AND HILARIOUS
THERE ARE A LOT OF POTENTIAL HAND COMBINATIONS AND TWEAKING THEM EVEN A LITTLE CAN CHANGE THE WHOLE DYNAMIC EACH GAME FEELS LIKE A DIFFERENT PUZZLE
ONCE YOU'RE PAST YOUR FIRST COUPLE OF PLAYS THE GAME IS ALMOST ENTIRELY IN YOUR HEAD IT'S ABOUT READING OTHER PEOPLE PREDICTING WHAT THEY WANT HOW THEY PLAN TO GET IT AND HOW YOU PLAN TO STOP THEM IN THAT WAY IT CAN BE A BIT LIKE POKER WHERE PLAYING OVER AND OVER WITH THE SAME GROUP WILL DEEPEN THE GAMEPLAY
RESISTANCE AVALON

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF

SECRET HITLER

ONITAMA FOR A GAME

CODENAMES
BOOTS ON THE GROUND
I THINK YOUR INITIAL THOUGHTS ARE CORRECT KEEPING THE BOX SIZE LOW IF YOU WERE WANTING TO SEND SOME HEAVIER CHINKIER GAMES THERE'S SOME FANTASTIC PHIL EKLUND GAMES THAT ARE SMALL IN STATURE BUT LOADED WITH GAME IS A DEFINITE HELP AND YEAH GETTING TO PLAY W BUDDIES WILL BE TOPS
I MIGHT SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BY NOW BUT I WOULD SUGGEST SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL WHILE YOU CAN STILL GET IT
IT IS A RATHER SMALL GAME THAT YOU CAN PLAY COOP OR SOLO EVEN WITHOUT THE EXPANSIONS ALL EXPANSIONS FIT INTO THE SMALL BOX FOR THE BASE GAME THERE IS A LOT OF REPLACEABILITY WITH THE EXPANSION YOU GOT EVEN MORE
SPLENDOR EXPANSION I'M EXCITED
THE ZENDO VIDEO SHOWS ZENDO USING LARGE PIPLESS PYRAMIDS ALONG WITH SIMILAR SIZED BLOCKS AND WEDGES RATHER THAN DIFFERENT SIZED PYRAMIDS THE RESPONSE FROM PEOPLE PLAY TESTING SUGGESTS THIS WILL REDUCE SOME OF THE MATHY RULES WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY A GOOD THING I'D LOVE TO PLAY TEST IT TO SEE HOW IT CHANGES THINGS
SPLENDOR EXPANSION


HMM GAME DOESN'T REALLY NEED IT ONE BUT I'M CURIOUS
WAS THE SNEAK PEEK FOR MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS JUST THE BARE BG PAGE OR AM I MISSING SOMETHING
DAMMIT I READ THAT AS MANSIONS OF MADNESS
YAY FOR SPLENDOR EXPANSION THIS IS ONE OF MY AV GAMES TO PLAY

ITS GREAT TO TEACH AS A GATEWAY GAME

ITS LIGHT ENOUGH TO PLAY WITHOUT GETTING IRRITATED

I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT IT I LOVE THE GAME
THE USE OF RISERS TO CREATE CURVED SHOTS IS INSPIRED
GREAT JOB MAN I MADE A POOL GOLF GAME WAY BACK IN THE DAY TO PUT ON A POOL TABLE AT MY LOCAL PUB YOU USE A STYROFOAM BALL AND CAN FLICK IT OR PUT BOTH INDEX FINGERS ON THE TABLE AND USE YOUR THUMBS TO LOB IT IT WAS GREAT FUN AND WE WOULD OFTEN GET A CROWD GOING WATCHING US EACH PERSON TOOK TURNS SETTING UP THE NEXT HOLE

WE STORED THE WHOLE THING IN A BAG IN THE CLOSET AND THE OWNER THREW IT OUT ONE WEEKEND THINKING IT WAS TRASH EPHAH I NEVER HAD THE HEART TO REMAKE IT

A DODSON
I THOUGHT THIS WAS PRETTY COOL KINDA REMINDS ME OF ICE COOL THIS WAS POSTED ON MY LOCAL DISC GOLF FB PAGE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS UNIQUE ENOUGH AND COOL TO SHOW YOU ALL HE STARTS PLAYING AT
VERY COOL I CAN IMAGINE SET UP FOR HOLES WOULD BE A PAIN BUT THAT LOOKS LIKE A TON OF FUN
VERY COOL IDEA I'M ALSO IMPRESSED WITH THE PUTTING ABILITY ON DISPLAY
VERY COOL REMINDS ME OF A WOODEN HOCKEY GAME I MADE AS A KID WHEN I WAS IN SCOUTS SORT OF LIKE THIS HETP

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT TO YOUR DESIGN MIGHT BE TO SEPARATE THE BASE PEG BOARD INTO PIECES THAT COULD BE REARRANGED INTO DIFFERENT SHAPES THEN YOU COULD LEAVE PEGS IN TO CREATE DIFFERENT TILES THAT COULD BE REARRANGED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS WOULD SPEED UP SETUP TIME AND ALLOW THE HOLES TO BE MOVED ONLY CHALLENGE WOULD BE COMING UP WITH A WAY TO CONNECT THE BOARDS WITHOUT CREATING A BUMP BETWEEN EDGES THAT WOULD HURT THE GAMEPLAY
THIS IS A VERY NEAT DIY TO DO WITH A KID PRETTY CHEAP PARTS CAN BE DONE ALL WITH HAND TOOLS AND MINIMAL LABOR AND LOTS OF ROOM TO EXPERIMENT
LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF FUN HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANY WAYS TO MAKE HOLE SETUPS GO MORE QUICKLY
FUNNY I WAS JUST WATCHING THIS ON THE DISC GOLF SUB AND THEN I CAME HERE AND ITS HERE AS WELL
THIS IS PRETTY COOL GOOD PRACTICE FOR FLICK EM UP
THANK YOU FOR SHARING

I AM PART OF A CLUB WHO NOT ONLY FOCUSES ON BOARD GAMES BUT ALSO CLASSIC AND MODERN WOODEN BASED GAMES FROM MOLKKŸ TO SHUFFLEBOARD TO OLD FRENCH GAMES NEARLY ALL OF THESE WOODEN BASED GAMES ARE MADE BY OUR MEMBERS

AS WE HAVE NOT DECIDED WHICH GAMES WE WILL BE MAKING THIS NEXT YEAR TABLETOP DISC GOLF SOUNDS QUITE PERSUADING AND INTERESTING

THANKS
THIS IS FANTASTIC
AWESOME INSPIRING WORK KEEP IT UP
DELETED
I ALREADY HAVE BATTLETOWN AND WHILE I LOVE IT A GREAT DEAL IT'S HARD TO GET OTHER PEOPLE TO SHARE IN MY LOVE OF THE FIGHTAHN

DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT BUYING ANY OF THE GAMES YOU LISTED WILL CHANGE THIS THOUGH
EXCEED THE BARRIER OF ENTRY IS LOW BUT ALSO REQUIRES A LOT OF TIME TO MASTER MY PROBLEM WITH BATTLETOWN IS THAT YOU NEED AROUND GAMES TO GET FAMILIAR WITH HOW THE PAIRS TO WORK AND HOW THE BASES INTERACT IN A RPS RELATIONSHIP BEFORE YOU CAN GRASP WHAT'S GOING ON THIS IS QUITE THE TASK TO TEACH UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT IS WILLING TO INVEST THE TIME

WITH EXCEED RIGHT FROM THE GET GO YOU HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF HOW YOU CAN SUCCEED WITH YOUR CHARACTER BASED ON HIS HER SPECIAL ABILITY CHARACTER CARDS AND EXCEED MODE THE DECISIONS ARE MORE MICRO SO EVEN AS A NEWBIE IT'S EASIER TO WORK THE STRATEGY YOU HAVE IN MIND
THERE IS ALSO DRAGON PUNCH WHICH IS SUPER PORTABLE AND VERY CHEAP
I QUITE LIKE IT IT FEELS LIKE POWER GRID BUT IT ONLY TAKES AN HOUR OR SO EVEN IN THE PLAYER GAME

A FEW PEOPLE I'VE PLAYED WITH DIDN'T LIKE NOT HAVING THE MAP THEY ACTUALLY LIKE THAT ASPECT OF THE GAME WITHOUT THE MAP THE GAME COMES DOWN TO EVALUATING THE WORTH OF POWER PLANTS AND TIMING YOUR TURN POSITION TO GET THE BEST ONES AND EASY ACCESS TO RESOURCES
I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT THE TWO PEOPLE THAT I KNOW THAT HAVE PLAYED IT LIKED IT VERY MUCH
I'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THE RELEASE DATE TOO AND ALSO THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED IT WHERE


I WAS SUPER EXCITED BUT AFTER WATCHING A PLAY THROUGH VI THINK I'LL PASSIVE IT DIDN'T SEEM AS MECHANICALLY INTERESTING TO ME AS POWER GRID AND I REALLY DONT LIKE THE ARTWORK
I ENDED UP PRINTING OUT AND LAMINATING LOCATION LISTS FOR ALL PLAYERS TO HOLD PLAYERS OFTEN LOOK AT THEIR ROLE CARDS SO IT ISNT TOO SUSPICIOUS FOR A SPY TO LOOK AT THE LOCATION LIST
I HAVE SPYFAULT TOO BUT YET TO PLAY I'VE DOWNLOADED AND PRINTED SOME PLAYER AIDS OFF BG THO WITH ONE SIDE HAVING ALL THE LOCATION IN THE GAME AND ON THE OTHER SIDE I'VE PUT SOME SUGGESTED QUESTIONS TO ASK PRINT OUT COPIES AND PASS ONE EACH TO ALL PLAYERS BEFORE STARTING
IS NOT AN IDEAL NUMBER FOR ANY STRAIGHT SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAME BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD TRY TO DEAL OUT A 5TH CARD NO ONE CAN SEE SO THAT OCCASIONALLY NO ONE IS THE SPY AND YOU CAN MAKE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE 5TH CARD AS IF IT WERE A PLAYER SHOULD YOU FEEL NO ONE MAY BE THE SPY

THIS GAME SHINES AT OR MORE BUT GETS GOOD AROUND PLAYERS THOUGH I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR ONLY PLAYERS
I PERSONALLY WOULDN'T EVEN TEACH THEM SPYFAULT INSTEAD TEACH THEM HOW TO PLAY A FAKE ARTISTS GOES TO NEW YORK IT'S THE EXACT SAME GAME EXCEPT YOU ARE DRAWING INSTEAD OF ANSWERING AND ASKING QUESTIONS WHICH IS OOOO MUCH EASIER FOR NEW PLAYERS EVEN IF THEY CAN'T DRAW

AFTER THEY GET USED TO THE CONCEPT OF ONE PLAYER TRYING TO STAY HIDDEN THEN MOVE ONTO SPYFAULT BUT BE PREPARED FOR SOME PEOPLE TO PREFER FAKE ARTIST BECAUSE OF ITS SIMPLICITY
ANDROID NETRUNNER

THE MOST INTERESTING DEEP AND REWARDING GAME IN MY EXPERIENCE THE DESIGN OF THAT GAME IS JUST BREATHTAKING AND WITH THE FIRST ROTATION OF TOURNAMENT LEGAL CARDS AS WELL AS THE CORE SET COMING EARLY NEXT YEAR I THINK IT WILL ONLY GET THAT MUCH BETTER THAT WILL ALSO BE AN IDEAL JUMPING ON POINT AS IT WILL MAKE THE BARRIER TO ENTRY A LOT LESS AS FAR AS COST I THINK IT'S FIRMLY A LIFESTYLE GAME THOUGH BECAUSE EVEN TEACHING IT CASUALLY IS A REALLY HARD MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB AND IT ONLY REVEALS IT'S DEPTH AND BEAUTY WHEN YOU DIG INTO THE VAST CARD POOL AND LEARN THE MAIN DECK ARCHETYPES ETC THE ASYMMETRY OF THE CORPS RUNNERS AND ALL THE FACTIONS AND IDENTITIES WITHIN MAKES IT MORE REWARDING THAN ANY OTHER CARD GAME I'VE PLAYED I NO LONGER PLAY BECAUSE MY GROUP MOVED ON TO A GAME OF THRONES WHICH I ALSO LOVE BUT IS ALSO MUCH MORE CASUAL FRIENDLY A BIG PLUS IN MY EYES



ANOTHER BRILLIANT FFA DESIGN BUT EVEN MORE OF A LIFESTYLE GAME IMO REQUIRES A HEFTY INVESTMENT SOMETIMES IN SHIPS YOU DON'T EVEN WANT JUST FOR THE CARDS TO USE FOR OTHER SHIPS MY BIG BEEF WITH THEIR MODEL OR MULTIPLES OF SHIPS JUST TO TRY OUT SOME THINGS THIS GAME IS A LOT MORE APPROACHABLE CASUALLY THAN NETRUNNER BUT THE COMPETITIVE SCENE IS PROBABLY THE NEXT BEST THING TO MTG AS FAR AS ORGANIZED PLAY COMMUNITY EVENTS ETC

DOMINION

THIS WOULD BE MY CHOICE FOR A GAME THAT CAN OFFER THE MOST CONTENT AFTER AN INITIAL INVESTMENT I ONLY HAVE THE BASE SET AND EXPANSIONS BUT THAT ALONE IS ENOUGH FOR YEARS AND YEARS WORTH OF GAMES WITHOUT ANYTHING GETTING STALE EVEN PLAYING WITH THE SAME SET OF CARDS OVER AND OVER IS INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU CAN TRY NEW STRATEGIES WITHIN THEM THE NEWER SETS ADVENTURES AND EMPIRES ARE SOME OF THE BEST EXPANSIONS FOR ANY GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED

MILLENIUM BLADES

THIS IS MY WILD CARD PICK AS IT'S A TRADITIONAL ONE BOX GAME BUT IT COMES WITH A TON OF EXPANSIONS THAT MAKE THE CORE GAME PLAY DIFFERENTLY EACH TIME WITHOUT CHANGING ANY MECHANICS IT'S A GAME FULL OF INTERESTING CARD COMBOS AND INTERACTIONS MUCH LIKE DOMINION AND THE LONGEVITY COMES FROM MIXING SETS AND FINDING THE BEST WAY TO CAPITALIZE ON WHAT'S AVAILABLE BUT WITH THE TWIST OF REAL TIME PRESSURE KEEPING YOU ON YOUR TOES
GO

CHEAP ENTRY AND INFINITE DEPTH
ALSO FOR MAGIC CODEX DICE MASTERS DOMINION PLAYERS IS A STATIC CUBE OF SAY ENOUGH TO LAST A LONG TIME OF MANY PLAYS DECKS CUSTOMIZATIONS OR IS THAT NOT ENOUGH

I CAN SPEAK FOR MAGIC A CUBE OF I EAST ENOUGH FOR PLAYERS OR PLAYERS WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CARD SETS IS ENOUGH FOR A VERY LONG TIME LUCKILY PRUNING ADDING AND ADJUSTING IT IN SMALL WAYS WILL PROVE TO BE FUN AND PROLONGING WHAT YOU CAN OR CAN'T DO YOU CAN TRY NEW THEMES REMOVE AND ADD THINGS YOU LIKE OR DISLIKE OR PUT IN ANSWERS THAT YOU FEEL ARE NECESSARY DUE TO OVERPOWERED STRATEGIES
SHUT UP SIT DOWN HAS NOT THE SAME LEVEL OF PRODUCTION BUT FOR ME IT'S WAAAF BETTER
THE FIRST EPISODE OF THE NEW SERIES OF TABLETOP CAME OUT TWO WEEKS AGO THE FIRST EPISODE IS ON YOUTUBE THEN IT'S GOING TO BE AN EXCLUSIVE ON A SERVICE CALLED ALPHA FOR A FEW MONTHS THEY SAY THE FULL SERIES WILL COME TO YOUTUBE IN EARLY
GIRLS GAME SHELF IS SIMILAR IN STYLE BUT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME POLISH SEASON 2 JUST STARTED AIRING

DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AS FOR PRODUCTION QUALITY RODNEY WATCH IT PLAYED VIDEOS HAVE EXCELLENT A V QUALITY AND ARE METICULOUSLY PRODUCED TO BE EXCELLENT LEARNING RESOURCES FOR THE GAMES THEY COVER THEY'RE NOT ENTERTAINING HOWEVER WHICH IS A LOT OF WHAT TABLETOP HAS GOING FOR IT

I ENJOY SHUT UP SIT DOWN FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE BUT THEIR VIDEO QUALITY AND PRESENTATION OF THE GAMES IS ALL OVER THE MAP SO I CAN'T USE THEM AS AN AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE FOR MAKING BUYING DECISIONS

I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER SERIES THAT OFFERS CONSISTENTLY CONTENT THAT'S BOTH INFORMATIVE AND ENTERTAINING
SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN HAS BETTER EVERYTHING HUMOR PRODUCTION VALUES ETC
ELDRITCH HORROR MIGHT WORK IT HAS AN INDIANA JONES GLOBE TROTTING ADVENTURE FEELS BUT CLEARLY HAS THE CTHULU THEME WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT PLEASE YOU I HAVE NEVER PLAYED IT WITH TWO BUT I HAVE SEEN OTHER SAY IT PLAYS JUST FINE THAT WAY BUT I DON'T KNOW IF 2 PLAYERS WOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP IT UNDER 2 HOURS OR NOT
I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT OTHER SUGGEST AS I'M ALSO LOOKING FOR A GREAT ADVENTURE GAME WITH THAT IN MIND I HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS

AIA LEGENDS OF A DRIFT IS A SANDBOX STYLE ADVENTURE SCI-FI TRADE GOODS AND BE A MERCHANT TAKE ON AND COMPLETE MISSIONS BE A PIRATE AND IRRITATE YOUR FRIENDS EXPLORE SPACE BE A MINER LOTS OF PATHS TO TAKE AND YOU CAN SET THE LENGTH OF THE GAME BY SHORTENING THE AMOUNT OF FAME POINTS NEEDED TO END THE GAME ONE OF MY FAVORITES

RUNEBOUND 2ND OR 3RD IS FINE IS AN ADVENTURE FANTASY EXPLORE AND FIGHT MONSTERS BUY AND UPGRADE YOUR ITEMS WEAPONS AND ARMOUR UNTIL YOU ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THE FINAL BOSS FIRST ONE TO DO IT WINS SO YOU CAN SET THE PACE BY COMPETING HARDCORE OR AGREE TO TAKE YOUR TIME AND BUILD UP YOUR CHARACTERS UNTIL YOU ARE SATISFIED

DEFENDERS OF THE REALM I HAVE NEVER PLAYED IT BUT HAVE SEEN IT RECOMMENDED A FEW TIMES ADVENTURE STYLE GAME WITH A FANTASY SETTING LOOKS NEAT BUT CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF TO SEE IF IT'S UP YOUR ALLEY

THOSE ARE THE CLOSEST I KNOW TO FORTUNE AND GLORY HONESTLY PLAY WISE I WOULD SAY RUNEBOUND FELT THE MOST SIMILAR TO IT
RELIC RUNNERS
ESCAPE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE
INCAN GOLD
LOST CITIES
THE ADVENTURERS PYRAMID OF HORUS OUT OF PRINT BUT MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND ONE

LOOK AT THESE ALL HAVE AN INDIANA JONES STYLE THEME BUT MOST AREN'T ADVENTURE GAMES


I HAVE THE MAT AND THE PIECES FROM THE GAME FIT JUST FINE WHAT DO YOU THINK IS WRONG WITH THEM
YES IT IS PERFECTLY FINE TO PRINT YOURSELF A BOARDGAME THE MECHANICS OF ANY GAME ARE NOT PROTECTED BY ANY COPYRIGHT LAW THE ARTWORK ITSELF AND THE DESIGN ARE MORE FIDDLY IN THIS AREA SO I WOULD REFRAIN FROM USING THOSE

DO KEEP IN MIND THAT OF THE BEAUTY OF THIS HOBBY IS THE ACTUAL FACT OF POSSESSING A NICE LOOKING PRODUCT

AND NO MOST BOARD GAMES ARE NOT JUST A SET OF RULES AND ROLLING DICE THIS SENTENCE COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH
MOST REALLY IF YOU SAY SO

BUT ANYHOW THE ANSWER IS YES THERE ARE GAMES OUT THERE
BOARDGAMECATEGORY
HEADPHONES WARNING AT THE KICKSTARTER VIDEO
THE BOX IS ONLY POUNDS COME ON STEVE JACKSON GAMES IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO
AFTER ALL THAT THE RULES ARE STILL A MESS THAT'S A BUMMER
I'M A BIG FAN OF THIS GAME I AGREE THE GAME WAS A MESS WHEN IT SHIPPED I THINK THE RULEBOOK IS GOOD AND THE CARDS ARE A HUGE STEP UP

MY GROUP REALLY LOVES THIS GAME BECAUSE THE SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR SOME PLAYER AUTHORSHIP IN THE CONTENT YOU ENCOUNTER WE LOVE THE TILE ICONS AND HOW THEY SUGGEST WHAT YOU FIND IN THE FREE QUESTING MODE I ALSO LOVE THAT WE NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MODULES WHICH ARE MORE DIRECTED SCENARIOS SO THERE'S THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS

THE INDIVIDUAL ASYMMETRICAL PLAYER DECKS FOR EACH CHARACTER ARE AWESOME YES SOMETIMES YOU GET BAD DRAWS THAT HAPPENS IN DOMINION AS WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY CARDS FACE DOWN FOR MINOR EFFECTS BUT WE ROLL WITH IT AND HAVE A GREAT TIME
I HAVEN'T BROUGHT MYSELF TO TRY THE GAME YET DO I NEED TO INVEST IN THE REPLACEMENT CARDS OR IS IT ENOUGH TO JUST PRINT THE RULEBOOK
I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS A MYTHOLOGY
SOUNDS LIKE A GAME MAY BE UP YOUR ALLEY GIVE ECLIPSE A SHOT IF YOU WANT TO DIVE OFF THE DEEP END AND CAN GET PEOPLE TO PLAY FOR HOURS TWILIGHT IMPERIUM
YOU DEFINITELY WANT TWILIGHT IMPERIUM
TAKE A LOOK AT FIRETEAM ZERO WAVE 2 SHOULD BE SOMETIME THIS SPRING THE BASE GAME IS REALLY WELL DONE SIMILAR TO GEARS OF WAR IN THAT IT'S DUDES ON A MAP WITH CARDS HP BUT IT'S ALSO VERY WELL DESIGNED IMO THERE'S DECK BUILDING OVER THE COURSE OF A CAMPAIGN PROB TAKES HRS TO FINISH ONE OFF AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT TERRIBLE TO SET UP
HOW ABOUT COSMIC ENCOUNTER OR MYTHOS TALES
IT DOESN'T REALLY FIT THE THEME YOU'RE AFTER BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ME AND MY FRIENDS THE ONLY HEAVY STRATEGIC GAME THAT EXISTS IS DIPLOMACY EVERYTHING ELSE IS CASUAL AND RANDOM
FOR A HANDFUL OF STARS FROM MARTIN WALLACE IS UP SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING YOU COULD LIKE IT'S HAS DECKBUILDING AND AREA CONTROL THAT PLAYS
YOU SHOULD GIVE GALAXY DEFENDERS A TRY SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE WHAT YOU WANT
OUR TWO FAVORITES OF ARE TERRA MYSTIC AND SCYTHE IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY BOTH ARE HIGHLY ENGAGING LEAVE YOU HANGING ON EVERY TURN AND CREATE SERIOUS SHIT TALK IN OUR CREW I LOVE HOW WHEN THE GAMES WRAP EVERYONE IS CONVERSING AND ANALYZING ABOUT HOW THEY COULD HAVE PLAYED BETTER

SCYTHE ISN'T DIFFICULT TO LEARN HAS A GUIDE BUILT IN FOR BEGINNERS FIRST TURNS AND IS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL BALANCED I THINK IT'S THEME COMES THROUGH VERY WELL SOME GAMES WILL BE A TOTAL COLD WAR WHILE OTHERS ARE A BATTLE ROYALE PLUS THE NEW EXPANSION ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY UP TO

TM IS CHALLENGING TO LEARN AT FIRST BUT INSANELY REWARDING IF YOU DIG EUROS LIKE AGRICOLA BALANCE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE SO BASICALLY YOU ADJUST FOR BETTER PLAYERS BY PLAYING DIFFERENT RACES WE PLAY THIS SO MUCH WE BOUGHT ACRYLIC OVERLAYS FOR THE PLAYER BOARDS TOTALLY WORTH IT

WE PLAY THE HELL OUT OF BOTH OF THESE GAMES SOMETIMES WE FLIP A COIN BC IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO DECIDE WHICH TO THROW DOWN ON THE TABLE TM HOLDS SPECIAL FONDNESS FOR ME AS IT WAS THE GAME THAT TURNED MY WIFE INTO A TABLETOP ADDICT
I HATE HOW STONERS THAT FANTASY CREATURE
I LIKE CARCASSONNE ALHAMBRA COLT EXPRESS DUNGEON FIGHTER VOLUSPA XENON PROFITEER TOBAGO ABOVE AND BELOW CONCORDIA ROCOCO NOTHING TOO HEAVY NOTHING WITH MUCH SERIOUS CONFLICT
HEY MAN HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED BOARD GAMES ON WEEWEED
I'VE PLAYED WINK AS A BIG STONED GROUP AND IT WAS AMAZING LOL ONE OF THE GOOFIEST GAMES EVER
MUSHROOM EATERS IS WIDELY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE GAMES EVER MADE IT ALSO SUPPOSEDLY HAS SOME GOOD ARTICLE

AND IT IS OF COURSE THE PERFECT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION
SOUNDS LIKE TWILIGHT IMPERIUM IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE AFTER
WHILE I CAN'T SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE IN THEORY I THINK HOKKAIDO WOULD WORK REALLY WELL
STONER FLUX
IF YOU'RE MOSTLY PLAYING 2 PLAYER I'D STAY AWAY FROM EXPLODING KITTENS IN MY EXPERIENCE IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG AS A TWO PLAYER AND IT GETS ALMOST TEDIOUS TO FINISH A GAME

EDIT TICKET TO RIDE EUROPE IS GREAT BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO ONE OF THE MAPS THAT'S SMALLER AND THAT PLAYS BETTER WITH 2 PEOPLE THE EUROPE MAP IS BIG AND IT'S VERY EASY TO AVOID EACH OTHER AND FIND ALTERNATIVE ROUTES AT 2 PLAYER THE BIG CITIES EXPANSION IN THE EXPANSION ALSO DOES A GOOD JOB OF TIGHTENING UP THE EUROPE MAP FOR TWO PLAYERS ALSO NORDIC COUNTRIES IS THE FULL GAME JUST ON A SMALLER MEANT TO BE PLAYED BY
MAYBE THROW A DEXTERITY GAME IN THERE JUNK ART PERHAPS

YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED TWO DECK BUILDERS TO START PAPERBACK AND DOMINION ONE SHOULD BE FINE UNTIL YOU KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE INTO I WILL WARN THAT DOMINION CAN BE A LITTLE BLAND WITHOUT AN EXPANSION MY GO TO DECK BUILDER RIGHT NOW IS CLANK

MY GO TO TWO PLAYER CARD GAME IS WONDERS DUEL THOUGH LOST CITIES IS SOLID JUST HAS MORE DEPTH WITHOUT ADDING A TON MORE COMPLEXITY
THIS MIGHT BE A WEIRD RECOMMENDATION BUT YOU COULD CHECK REBELLION FOR AN ENTRY WARGAME MY GIRLFRIEND LIKES IT A LOT IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE GAME THAT PLAYS UNDER 2 HOURS AND IS LOTS OF FUN BUT OFFERS ENOUGH STRATEGY TO LAST FOR QUITE SOME TIME

THESE WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATIONS
DEFINITELY CONCORDIA WITH THE SALSA EXPANSION FOR A BETTER 2 PLAYER BOARD LORDS OF WATERDEEP DISCOVERIES WONDERS DUEL JAIPUR IMPERIAL SETTLERS AND FIVE TRIBES MAYBE ALSO DEAD OF WINTER BUT YOU'LL NEED MORE THAN 2 FOR THIS ONE
I'VE BEEN INTO BOARD GAMES FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND ONE THAT I STILL LOVE EVEN AFTER HUNDREDS OF PLAYS IS CASTLES OF BURGUNDY IT PLAYS VERY WELL WITH 2 PLAYERS BUT ALSO PLAYS AND PLAYERS EQUALLY WELL PATCHWORK IS ALSO GREAT BUT IT'S STRICTLY 2 PLAYER SO YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY IT WHEN YOU HAVE ANYONE ELSE OVER

HONESTLY THOUGH I THINK YOU DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB HONING DOWN A LIST OF VARIED GAMES THAT WOULD BE FUN TO OWN
BRACELET AND SOME SCENTED CANDLES BRO
COSMOS HAS A LINE OF POPULAR 2 PLAYER GAMES LIKE KAHUNA
KANAZAWA EASY TO LEARN STILL CHALLENGING CARDS AND GORGEOUS COMPONENTS
I THINK YOU NEED SOME TYPE OF EURO ENGINE BUILDER IN YOUR COLLECTION I'M A BIG FAN OF THE VARIABLE SIMULTANEOUS ACTION ONES LIKE SAN JUAN WHICH IS A GREAT PLACE TO START PUERTO RICO RACE FOR THE GALAXY AND ROLL FOR THE GALAXY ARE RELATED GAMES WITH THE SAME ACTION SELECTION MECHANIC I LIKE ENGINE BUILDERS WHERE YOU'RE BUILDING A COLLECTION OF CARDS TILES WITH ABILITIES WHICH ARE ALL HELPING EACH OTHER TOWARDS A COMMON STRATEGY THE NICE THING ABOUT THESE SIMULTANEOUS ACTION GAMES IS THAT THERE'S LITTLE DOWN TIME SINCE EVEN WHEN IT'S SOMEONE TURN YOU STILL GENERALLY GET TO DO SOMETHING
YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH CASTLES OF BURGUNDY IF ITS JUST A 2 PLAYER FROM YOUR LIST ID SAY THAT PANDEMIC SPLENDOR ARE YOUR BEST BETS

IF YOU WANT TO UPGRADE SPLENDOR THEN CHOOSE VICEROY INSTEAD ALSO THESE GAMES PLAY GREAT WITH MORE PEOPLE AS WELL AS 2 PLAYERS

TO BE FAIR IVE NEVER PLAYED LOST CITIES CTHULU REALMS PATCHWORK ARBETORUM OR EXPLODING KITTENS BUT I HAVE PLAYED THE REST

ALSO DEFINITELY GET CODENAMES FOR COMPANY ITS A GOOD PARTY GAME AND LIKE YOU SAID IT'S CHEAP

IF YOUR GIRLFRIEND ISNT MUCH INTO COMPETITION AND LIKES CO OP PANDEMIC IS ALRIGHT GOOD PLAY THROUGHS I'D COUNTER DOMINION WITH SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE DECKBUILDING GAMES AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEVEL UP YOUR CHARACTERS IN THAT AND WORK TOWARDS A GOAL UPGRADE YOUR PEOPLE

IF SHE NEEDS A MORE BASIC DECKBUILDER I ACTUALLY PREFER STAR REALMS OVER DOMINION X
I WOULD SAY ALL OF THE ABOVE WOULD MAKE A REALLY GOOD FOUNDATION OF A GAMES CUPBOARD

ISTANBUL IS ALSO AN EXCELLENT GAME THAT PLAYS WELL WITH TWO AND SCALES UP TO FIVE VERY THINKING QUITE SHORT ALWAYS DIFFERENT DUE TO BOARD SETUP

FIRST CLASS IS A NEW GAME THIS YEAR AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE DEPENDENCE ON WHICH CARDS BECOME AVAILABLE AND WHEN IT'S ALWAYS DIFFERENT AND REQUIRES ADAPTIVE TACTICS RATHER THAN FIXED STRATEGY

PUERTO RICO IS A CLASSIC BUT CAN BE TRICKY FOR NEW PLAYERS IN A GROUP WITH EXPERIENCE


PERSONALLY I'D GO WITH A PAPERBACK AND FORGET ABOUT DOMINION THEY ARE FUNDAMENTALLY VERY SIMILAR BUT PAPERBACK HAS THE ADDED FUN OF MAKING WORDS IN YOUR HAND INSTEAD OF PLAYING CARDS THAT SIMPLY TELL YOU WHAT TO DO PAPERBACK IS A LOT MORE FUN IN MY OPINION
WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU GUYS LIKE FURY OF DRACULA ONE PERSON PLAYS DRACULA THE REST PLAY VAMPIRE HUNTERS AND TRY TO FIND AND KILL HIM BEFORE HE GETS TOO STRONG ITS LESS MAN VS GAME AND MORE PVP I MEAN SINCE YOU GAVE VERY FEW PREFERENCES MECHANICS ETC I'M JUST GOING TO SAY HIT BOARD GAME GEEK LOOK AT THEIR TOP CLICK ON NAMES OF GAMES THAT SOUND COOL TO YOU AND GO FROM THERE
IF YOU LIKE BUT ARE COMPETITIVE GROUP AS WELL I WOULD SUGGEST
SEMI COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE PLAYERS ARE AGAINST EACH OTHER UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER SO THEY ALL DON'T LOOSE THE GAME EVERY PLAYER IS CEO OF AN ENERGY COMPANY THAT NEEDS TO ADD GREEN PLANTS AND STOP POLLUTION BY REDUCING FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO PROPOSE PROJECT INSTALL PROJECT AND CONSTRUCT POWER PLANT WHILE IN THE PROCESS OTHER PLAYERS CAN CONTINUE WHERE YOU STOPPED UNTIL POWER PLANT IS CONSTRUCTED WHICH MEANS YOU CAN PREPARE EVERYTHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE EVEN THAT IS NOT YOUR INTENTION IT IS MID ON HEAVIER SIDE EURO GAME WITH INTERESTING THEME AND GOOD MECHANICS
FURY OF DRACULA IS A PRETTY SOLID BET IT'S A GAME WHERE THE IS DRACULA BUT BE WEARY THAT AS DRACULA THERE CAN BE A LOT OF DOWNTIME FOR THAT PLAYER IF YOUR GROUP ISN'T PARTICULARLY FAST

GHOST STORIES GHOST STORES IS ANOTHER COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE YOU PLAY AS SHAMANS TRYING TO RID THE WORLD OF GHOSTS THAT KEEP POPPING UP INTO EXISTENCE IT'S REALLY HARD AND COULD MAKE FOR A FUN COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT TO SEE WHO CAN KILL THE MOST GHOSTS TO BE FRANK I DOUBT YOU'LL WIN IT'S VERY HARD

GAME U HTTPREQUEST HAS GOT YOU WITH A GOOD ONE HOW ABOUT ANOTHER ONE DARK MOON ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES WHERE PLAYERS ARE TRAPPED UPON THE DARK MOON TITAN TRYING TO SURVIVE IN THIS SOMEWHAT DESOLATE MINING FACILITY IT BECOMES QUICKLY CLEAR TO YOU THAT SOMEONE HAS GOTTEN INFECTED ON THE SHIP AND IS TRYING TO QUICKLY INFECT OTHER CREW MEMBERS IT'S ABOUT A MINUTE GAME OF DICE ROLLING AND DECEPTION

MYSTERIUM CONSIDERING I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG YOUR GROUP LETS LOOK AT ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LOOKING GAMES EVER AND PLAYS LIKE A COOKIE CRUMBLE OF BROKEN IMAGES THAT PLAYERS NEED TO DEDUCE INFORMATION FROM TO UNDERSTAND WHO MURDERED THEM AND IS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND IT ALL IT IS A WONDERFUL GAME BUT IF YOUR GROUP IS LARGER THAN PEOPLE ON AVERAGE LOOK FOR A GAME CALLED DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG I PREFER DECEPTION BUT I THINK IT ONLY DOES WELL AT ITS HIGHER PLAYER COUNTS OF PLAYERS
TAKE A LOOK AT TERRA MYSTIC CLOSER TO CATAN THAN THE OTHER BUT WITHOUT DICE AND MORE DEPTH A STAPLE GAME THAT MY GROUP COMES BACK TO OVER AND OVER

U GETINFO
HAVE YOU TAKEN ANY LOOKS AT SUBURBIA IT'S A TILE LAYING GAME ONLY FOR FOUR PLAYERS SADLY WHERE YOU BUILD YOUR OWN AREA OF A CITY YOU ARE DOING YOUR OWN THING BUT YOUR DECISIONS OFTEN INFLUENCE OTHERS IN A SLIGHTLY WAY THAN MOST EURO GAMES SO YOUR PLAYGROUND MIGHT LIKE IT IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES
I PLAY GAMES WITH A DECENTLY SIZED OPEN MINDED GROUP OF PEOPLE WE ALL GOT HOOKED ON CATAN AND HAVE SINCE STARTED BRANCHING OUT OUR RUNNING FAVORITE IS ELDRITCH HORROR WITH PANDEMIC MIXED IN AS WELL WE LIKE CO-OP GAMES BUT ARE ALSO A COMPETITIVE GROUP

U MRBANANAGRABBER THIS HONESTLY JUST ISN'T HELPFUL AS IT LACKS IN SPECIFICITY

COULD YOU PLEASE BE MORE SPECIFIC AS TO THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND TOWARDS DO YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT'S A HOUR AFFAIR OR A LIGHT PARTY GAME HOW MUCH CONFLICT DO YOU WANT IN THE GAME AND HOW MUCH BRAIN BURN IS APPROPRIATE WHAT PRICE POINT ARE YOU CONSIDERING

WITHOUT THIS SORT OF INFORMATION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO JUST BE SHOOTING IN THE DARK MORE OR LESS

THAT BEING SAID FURY OF DRACULA IS QUITE POPULAR BUT ALSO QUITE LENGTHY IT CAN EASILY TAKE THREE HOURS ESPECIALLY ON YOUR EARLY PLAYS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK IT UP SOONER RATHER THAN LATER AS IT'S GONE OUT OF PRINTING
ARCADIA QUEST IS PLAYER VS PLAYER VS THE BOARD EVERYONE IS TRYING TO COMPLETE GOALS TOGETHER OR SEPARATELY WHILE KILLING EACH OTHER TOO IS WELL RECEIVED WITH LOTS OF MICE MINIS

OTHER COOP AND COMPETITIVE GAMES WOULD BE ONES WITH BETRAYERS DEAD OF WINTER IS VERY THEMATIC AND PRETTY DIFFICULT WITHOUT EVEN HAVING A BETRAYER OTHER ONES WITH DIFFERENT THEMES INCLUDE BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA AND DARK MOON FOR BIGGER GROUPS AND SHORTER GAMES GO FOR RESISTANCE AVALON OR ONE NIGHT GAMES
THANKS JUST PICKED UP A COPY
ASW MISSED IT
THAT'S NICE BUT WHEN WILL INVADERS FROM AFAR BE AVAILABLE MOST OF THE ONLINE PLACES WON'T LET YOU ORDER PREORDER IT AND MY FAGS SAYS THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN IT WILL BE COMING
I USED TO LIVE IN ORLANDO AND WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GO TO THE ACTUAL COOLSTUFF STORE A LOT DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL LOL
AND OUT AGAIN
I'M AMAZED THE HYPE HASN'T COOLED ON THIS ONE

IT'S JUST SO DULL WITH FAKE VARIABILITY AND ALMOST NO INTERACTION NOR TOUGH DECISIONS
IT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE THEY LOST THE LICENSE TO BATTLEDORE THE COMMANDS COLORS SYSTEM OR THEY WANT TO SHIFT THEIR DESIGNERS OVER TOWARDS THEIR NEW RUNEWARS MINIATURES GAME WHICH TAKES PLACE IN THE SAME UNIVERSE IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE SYSTEM JUST WASN'T AS LUCRATIVE AS THEY'D HOPED IT WOULD BE AND THEY NEED TO DUMP INVENTORY THAT'S NOT MOVING
IT'S DEAD

FFA HAS MOVED ON TO THE RUNEWARS MINIATURES GAME
IT'S HARD TO SAY THERE WAS TALK OF THE GAME BEING DEAD FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE THE LAST SET OF EXPANSIONS WERE FINALLY ANNOUNCED THERE WAS REALLY NO SIGN OF A FUTURE FOR THE GAME UNTIL THERE WAS SUDDENLY A WHOLE WAVE OF NEW STUFF YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY ASSUME THEY WERE CLEARING STOCK IN THE SALE BIG SALES ARE SOMETIME MORE ABOUT INCREASING PRODUCT EXPOSURE THAN REDUCING STOCK CONSIDERING THEY LIKELY WANT TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN TERRINOTH IP NOW THAT THEY'VE GIVEN UP RIGHTS TO WARHAMMER IP THEY MIGHT BE TRYING TO INCREASE EXPOSURE OF THAT AS WELL HELL IF I KNOW THOUGH
IT'S A SHAME THAT IT'S DEAD BATTLEDORE WAS FUN HOWEVER NO DWARFS AND NO ORCS I DIDN'T PICK UP MUCH BEYOND THE CORE SET
ARE YOU IN THE US TICKET TO RIDE IS ON AMAZON AS I TYPE THIS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE LOWER PRICE HERE ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES ALL PRICES FROM AMAZON

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF IS ONLY LIKE IT'S A FUN INTERPRETATION OF CLASSIC WEREWOLF
PANDEMIC IS A SUPERB CO-OP GAME AND AMAZON HAS IT AT RIGHT NOW
KINGDOM BUILDER IS A MORE ABSTRACT STRATEGY GAME CURRENTLY AT
DOMINION IS THE GAME THAT PUT DECKBUILDING GAMES ON THE MAP THE NEW 2ND EDITION IS
LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS A STRATEGY GAME SET IN THE D D UNIVERSE LIKE TICKET TO RIDE IT IS LOW ON DIRECT CONFRONTATION BETWEEN PLAYERS

GOOD LUCK
RISK STAR WARS EDITION MIGHT BE A GOOD CHOICE IT'S NOT ACTUALLY RISK IT'S JUST GOT THE RISK NAME ON IT FOR NAME RECOGNITION
DP REF IE DTF QID SR KEYWORDS RISK STAR WARS

GREAT GAME EASY TO LEARN AND PLAY LOTS OF FUN
TICKET TO RIDE WAS A REALLY GOOD PRICE ON AMAZON YESTERDAY LIKE OR SOMETHING YOU MIGHT SEE IF THERE ARE STILL GOOD SALES GOING ON I SNAGGED ALHAMBRA YESTERDAY FOR LIKE AND SUBURBIA FOR
WHAT DOES HE LIKE ABOUT TR

THE TRACK BUILDING AND SECRET GOALS THEN YOU COULD LOOK AT TRANSAMERICA


IF YOU BOTH LIKE MARKHAM HORROR AND THE ONLY ISSUE IS THE LENGTH GIVE ELDRICH HORROR A TRY ITS VERY MUCH THE SAME IDEA BUT STREAMLINED AND USUALLY ONLY TAKES THE PLAYTIME OR LESS THAN MARKHAM

OTHER CO-OP GAMES THAT ARE A HIT WITH MY GROUP
PATHFINDER ADVENTURE CARD GAME
CASTLE PANIC
SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE
STAR TREK FIVE YEAR MISSION
LEGENDARY MARVEL DECK BUILDING GAME


I THINK A LARGE PART OF THE GENIUS OF DOMINION AND A BIG PART OF WHERE OTHER DECKBUILDERS GO WRONG IS THAT VP CARDS MAKE YOUR DECK WORSE THERE'S A REAL TENSION BETWEEN MAKING YOUR DECK BETTER AND GETTING POINTS I GUESS THIS IS MORE OF A SCREW THE LEADER THAN HELP LAST PLACE EFFECT BUT IT DOES THE SAME THING
ONE OF THE MOST ELEGANT ONES IS SUBURBIA THE HIGHER IN SCORE A PLAYER GETS THE MORE HURDLES THEY CROSS THAT SET THEM BACK IN INCOME AND REPUTATION I CALL IT ELEGANT BECAUSE IT'S JUSTIFIED THEMATICALLY THE BIGGER A CITY GETS THE HARDER IT IS TO MAINTAIN AND KEEP A NICE REPUTATION
ISLE OF SKYE GIVES EXTRA GOLD TO PLAYERS IN THE LATER ROUNDS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS AHEAD OF THEM
GRAVWELL IS AN ENTIRE GAME BUILT AROUND A RUBBERBAND COMEBACK EFFECT
VAST IS KINDA GOOD AS IT FORCES OTHER PLAYERS TO HELP YOU OUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE SINCE IF YOU DIE SOMEONE ELSE WINS
HAS A CATCH UP MECHANISM WITH THE CARDS ESSENTIALLY IF YOU ARE BEHIND ON EITHER NUMBER OF TROOPS OR TYPES OF HIGHER LEVELED TROOPS THEN YOU CAN USE A ONE TIME ABILITY IT SEEMS A LITTLE HAM-FISTED BUT IT WORKS
ISLE OF SKYE POWER GRID AND LORDS OF WATERDEEP WERE THE FIRST THAT CAME TO MY MIND
I LIKE THE TAXATION MECHANISM IN BELFORT
NOT SO MUCH A COMEBACK OR RUBBER BAND MECHANIC BUT IN LORDS OF VEGAS THERE ARE POINT GATES WHERE YOU NEED TO SCORE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF POINTS AT ONE TIME IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM ACTUALLY COUNT THIS IS DIFFICULT TO DO AS THE GAME GOES ON SO IT PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM RUNNING AWAY WITH THE VICTORY
PATCHWORK HAS ONE WHERE YOU GET TO CONTINUE TAKING TURNS UNTIL YOUR TOKEN PASSES THE TOKEN ON THE IT'S A REALLY GREAT MECHANICS THAT KEEPS THINGS CLOSE WITHOUT SEEMING UNFAIR TO EITHER SIDE
SOME CUBES IN AUTOMOBILES ALLOW FOR THIS I'M SPECIFICALLY THINKING OF THE GREEN CUBE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MOVE AS MANY GRAY SPACES AS YOUR CURRENT POSITION IF YOU'RE THE LAST ONE
ONLY AGE MATTERS IN BLOOD RAGE YOU GET A HUGE AMOUNT OF POINTS IF YOU PLAY IT RIGHT AGE IS KIND OF A JOKE
URBAN SPRAWL HAS A VERY GOOD SMASH BUILDINGS POWER FOR THE LAST PLACE PLAYER THAN CAN BRING THEM QUITE A BIT UP IN THE RANKINGS RATHER QUICKLY
EMET IS PRETTY GOOD THE PERSON IN LAST PLACE DETERMINES THE TURN ORDER FOR THE NEXT ROUND TURN ORDER IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN THAT GAME

KINGSBURG GIVES THE FAVOR TO WHOEVER IS IN LAST PLACE WHICH GIVES THEM AN EXTRA DIE IT'S NOT TERRIBLY THEMATIC THOUGH
NOT SURE IF HOKKAIDO QUALIFIES BUT IT DOES HAVE THE INTERESTING MECHANIC OF PICKING WHO GOES FIRST EACH ROUND THE PLAYER WHO IS FARTHEST BEHIND ON THE BOARD MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A BUT SOMETIMES GETTING THE FIRST MOVE IN HOKKAIDO ALLOWS YOU TO COMPLETELY MESS UP EVERYONE ELSE
SNOW TAILS IF YOU HAVE A BALANCED SLED YOU GET BONUS MOVEMENT EQUAL TO YOUR CURRENT POSITION SO THIRD PLACE WOULD GET TO MOVE THREE EXTRA SPACES
NOT NECESSARILY GOOD AND IN FACT NOT NECESSARILY RUBBER BAND BUT IN ALCHEMISTS IF YOU HAVE HIGH ENOUGH REPUTATION EFFECTIVELY SCORE WHEN YOU LOSE REPUTATION YOU LOSE MORE AND IF YOU HAVE LOW ENOUGH REPUTATION WHEN YOU LOSE REPUTATION YOU DON'T LOSE AS MUCH NOT NECESSARILY RUBBER BAND BECAUSE HAVING HIGHER REPUTATION ALSO GIVES BENEFITS AND IF YOU CAN SOMEHOW AVOID LOSING REPUTATION AT ALL THE PENALTY DOESN'T COME INTO EFFECT BUT IT'S THERE AND PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE WITH RUBBER BAND MECHANIC AMONG MY GAMES
SECRET HITLER THEY GAMES ARE ABOUT ITS PLAYS ALOT LIKE THE RESISTANCE IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THAT BUS WHERE RESISTANCE CAN BE A RUNAWAY GAME SOMETIMES SECRET HITLER YOU CAN HAVE AND IT WILL LEVEL OUT TO PRETTY FAST
BLOODRAGE WAS THE FIRST GAME THAT CAME TO MY MIND GRANTED I HAVE ONLY PLAYED IT ONCE AND WON BUT LITERALLY EVERY CONFLICT FIGHT I HAD I WAS VICTORIOUS BUT MY OPPONENT CAME OUT AHEAD IN VICTORY POINTS WAS DEFINITELY A STRANGE EXPERIENCE
KING OF TOKYO CARCASSONNE IF YOU PLAY THE LONG GAME WITH FARMER PLACEMENT AND IT PAYS OFFICIAL
I'D RECOMMEND DIXIT IS A GREAT CREATIVE STORYTELLING GAME
CODENAMES SEEMS TO FIT THE CHEAP AND IMAGINATION PART
I HAVE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS WONDERS THE RESISTANCE AND ONE NIGHT IN WEREWOLF
THERE WAS JUST THIS THREAD LAST WEEK I WOULD LOOK THERE
I HAD A LOT OF FUN PLAYING SAY ANYTHING AND TELESTRATIONS WITH MY FAMILY LAST YEAR
BETWEEN TWO CITIES IS ON AMAZON UK FOR TILE DRAFTING AND CITY BUILDING WITH A ASPECT TO IT SCALES WELL THROUGH THE PLAYER COUNT PLAYS QUICKLY TO YOU CAN PLAY A FEW TIMES SIT NEXT TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE EACH TIME
BONANZA IS GREAT GAME AT A GOOD PRICE GAME IS MOSTLY ABOUT TRADING SO IT GETS EVERYONE INTO THE ACTION
SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS WITH THE PLAYER EXPANSION PERFECT FAMILY GAME
I HEARD THERE IS A GOOD PNP GAME
ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO TRY SOME GOODWILL STORES THEY MAY HAVE SOME HIDDEN GEMS IF YOU DON'T MIND PLAYING GAMES WITH A LITTLE LESS POLISH YOU COULD VOLUNTEER TO PLATIEST GAMES

ROLLING STOCK
MOTTAINAI


MAKE A COPY OF TAK OR SANTORINITE

DEEP FUTURE MIGHT WORK FOR YOU
CAN'T STOP IS AN EASY GAME TO MAKE QUORRIDOR CAN BE MADE EASILY IF YOU HAVE TWO SETS OF LOONEY LABS PYRAMIDS THERE ARE A TON OF GREAT GAMES YOU CAN PLAY SOME WHICH REQUIRE A SMALL BIT OF PRINTING PIKEMEN IS A GREAT EXAMPLE

I ALSO RECENTLY SAW ON BG A GUIDE ON HOW TO PLAY ISLE OF SKYE WITH A CARCASSONNE SET
DUELING IS A GOOD GAME THAT PLACES WITH A DECK OF CARDS AND SOME SIX SIDES DICE
HAVING BUILT A FEW PNP GAMES MYSELF OVER THE YEARS I'VE FOUND IT'S MORE A LABOUR OF LOVE THAN A SAVER OF MONEY UNLESS YOU WORK AT SOME PLACE WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET STEEPLY DISCOUNTED PRICES ON MATERIALS THE REAL COST OF PNP GAMES IS NOT NEARLY AS ATTRACTIVE AS IT FIRST SEEMS IT OUGHT TO BE ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY PIRACY WHILE I'LL OCCASIONALLY DOWNLOAD A CAR WHO DOESN'T I AM A LITTLE MORE RELUCTANT ABOUT CUTTING OUT THE BENEFACTORS IN A HOBBY RUN BY AND FOR HOBBYISTS FOR THE MOST PART I HAVE PRINTED A FEW GAMES WHICH WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE ANY LONGER BUT I'D MUCH RATHER JUST PAY THE FEW MORE BUCKS FOR THE PROPER GAME NOW

FOR SOMEONE IN YOUR POSITION I WOULD SUGGEST KEEPING AN EYE ON THE SECOND HAND MARKET MY LOCAL USED LISTINGS AKIN TO CRAIGSLIST ALWAYS HAVE MANY PAGES OF EURO GAMES AVAILABLE FOR SALE USUALLY QUITE GOOD PRICES IF YOU ALSO BROADEN YOUR VIEW TO KEEP AN EYE ON BG MARKETPLACE OR AUCTION LISTINGS YOU CAN FIND SOME ABSOLUTE STEALS THERE

ANOTHER THING TO LOOK INTO IS FINDING SOME MORE GAMERS IN YOUR AREA WITH SIMILAR TASTES AND THEN START TRADING GAMES WITHIN THE GROUP TO LET EVERYONE TRY OUT GAMES THEY DON'T OWN ALREADY
MAKE A COPY OF TAK OR SANTORINITE

THIS MAY JUST BE THE MOST ASKED QUESTION ON THIS SUB MANY PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF WANT TO SHARE THEIR GAMING WITH AN SO MOST OF MY GAMING IS WITH MY WIFE SO I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU FIND SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL BOTH ENJOY

YOUR FIRST STOP SHOULD BE OUR GUIDE AND YOU CAN ALSO TRY A SEARCH

AND I MADE THIS POST ABOUT THIS VERY TOPIC

SO MANY GREAT OPTIONS OUT THERE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

ANYWAYS GET PATCHWORK
MY F LOVES PATCHWORK AND PAPERBACK

ALSO SHE'S BEEN QUITE FOND OF ZOOLORETTO LATELY
PAPERBACK AND PATCHWORK BOTH ARE CHEAP AND REFRESHINGLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU ARE PLAYING RIGHT NOW EASY TO LEARN AS WELL
YOU COULD TRY SOME COOPERATIVE GAMES I'VE PLAYED TIME STORIES WITH MY F AND WE HAD A GREAT TIME ALSO PANDEMIC IS A GREAT GAME THAT DOESN'T HAVE TOO MANY RULES IN IT BUT ENOUGH TO HAVE COMPLEXITY
PATCHWORK IS ALWAYS RECOMMENDED FOR 2 PEOPLE

HOPE THAT YOU'RE GOOD AT TERRIS
JAIPUR
PATCHWORK AND CARCASSONNE ARE GREAT 2 PLAYER GAMES WITH AN ACCESSIBLE THEME

PATCHWORK AND LOST CITIES AND JAIPUR
MY FIANCE AND I WERE RECENTLY TURNED ON TO HIVE QUICK MINUTE GAME WITH SOME STRATEGY AND INFINITE REPLAY VALUE SINCE THE BOARD CHANGES EVERY TIME
SPLENDOR
CARCASSONNE
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY

IN ADDITION TO PATCHWORK

EDIT FORGOT TO MENTION JAIPUR
SPLENDOR IS CHEAP AND IS GOOD WITH 2 PLAYERS EASY TO PICK UP AND IS A NICE INTRO TO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN MASS MARKET GAMES
SPLENDOR IS EASY TO PICK UP QUICK TO PLAY AND IMHO CAN BE PLAYED OVER AND OVER WITHOUT TIRING OF IT IT'S A GOOD COMPETITIVE GATEWAY GAME IMHO
WONDERS DUEL CAN'T RECOMMEND ENOUGH
AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES

BOARDGAME

EXPLODING KITTENS

BOTH A HIT I BOTH ALWAYS GET DESTROYED BY HER PLAYING THEM YOU MAY WANT TO PRACTICE
IF SHE CRUSHES YOU AT EVERYTHING TRY LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL AND HAVE HER PLAY THE INVESTIGATORS IT'S DAMNED TRICKY TO CATCH JACK THE INSTRUCTIONS SUGGEST TO HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCED PLAYER PLAY JACK BUT I DID THAT WITH MY WIFE AND SHE ONLY PICKED UP TWO CLUES OVER THE COURSE OF THE FOUR NIGHTS NEEDLESS TO SAY I HAVE TO PLAY THE COPS NOW AND IT MAKES FOR A MUCH MORE TENSE GAME
YEAH I SEE THIS QUESTION ASKED A LOT TOO I'M LAZY SO I'M JUST GONNA CUT AND PASTE MY RESPONSE TO THE LAST GUY

TOP MULTIPLAYER GAMES THAT ARE BEST WITH TWO

MY GIRLFRIEND HATED PATCHWORK WHICH SEEMS TO BE A COMMON SUGGESTION SHE DOES LOVE STAR REALMS CARCASSONNE LOST CITIES BATTLE LINE AND PANDEMIC
I GOT TO PLAY TEST THIS GAME LAST YEAR RYAN IS A REALLY GOOD GUY
LOOKS INTERESTING BUT I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR RETAIL ON THIS ONE I LIKE THE MECHANIC FOR RUMBLING FORWARD THOUGH
DON'T WAIT FOR RETAIL ON THIS ONE AS ITS MY FIRST PROJECT IF IT DOESN'T SERIOUSLY RETAIL MAY NEVER HAPPEN DEFINITELY APPRECIATED THE KIND WORDS THOUGH
I'VE PLAYED IT AND IT'S QUITE ENJOYABLE THE EXPANSIONS ARE EXCELLENT ADDITIONS TOO THEY REALLY MIX UP THE FORMULA

I THINK THE PRIMARY REASON WHY IT'S SO OVERLOOKED IS THAT THE DUNGEON CRAWLER GENRE IS SO OVERCROWDED AT THE MOMENT AND AT LEAST PERSONALLY FOR ME I FIND THAT IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS A NOTCH ABOVE IT AND SINCE FFA PUTS OUT A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF IA CONTENT IT PREVENTS GALAXY DEFENDERS FROM GETTING TO THE TABLE
I THINK MOST EVERYONE WHO HAS PLAYED IT HAS AGREED THAT IT IS A GREAT GAME THE MAIN COMPLAINT SEEMS TO BE THAT JAMMING IS REALLY JUST AN ANNOYING MECHANIC BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF COMPLAINTS I THINK IT JUST GETS OVERSHADOWED BY OTHER EPIC MINIATURE GAMES OR THEMATIC GAMES I EAST STAR WARS

THE COMPANY PUT OUT A KICKSTARTER LAST YEAR FOR SWORDS AND SORCERY WHICH IS A SIMILAR PLAY STYLE BUT IN A FANTASY SETTING LOOKS LIKE IT ADDS A LOT MORE COMPLEXITY TO THE GALAXY DEFENDERS GAME MECHANICS AND I'M EXCITED FOR WHEN IT ARRIVES IT RAISED SOMETHING LIKE
I LIKED IT A LOT I'M NEARLY DONE WITH THE CAMPAIGN

ONE OF THE OTHER COMMENTS NAILED IT THOUGH I PREFER DESCENT WITH THE NEW APP AND THERE'S SO MUCH CONTENT FOR DESCENT NOW GD DOESN'T MAKE IT TO THE TABLE
IT IS A PRETTY EPIC GAME SYSTEM WITH SOME REALLY DETAILED AND FUN RULES AND MAPS ACTUALLY IT SITS AT THE TOP OF MY FAVORITE CO-OP TACTICAL GAMES LIKE GEARS OF WAR AND FIRETEAM ZERO
FIRETEAM ZERO HUH IS IT COOL R THE BADDIES AI CONTROLLED GALAXY
MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT ABOUT THE GAME IS THAT IT'S HARD TO PLAY AS A CO-OP BECAUSE QUARTERBACKING IS SO EASY I THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ENEMIES ARE SO DANGEROUS YOU ONLY HAVE A FEW REASONABLE OPTIONS TO WIN MISSIONS BESIDES THAT I LOVE IT IT'S MY SECOND FAVORITE SOLO GAME NEXT TO AMBUSH ALSO SWORD SORCERY SHOULD BE SHIPPING OUT SO KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED FOR THAT
IS IT TO LATE TO BACK SWORD AND SORCERY I HAVE AVER BACKED A GAME ON KICKSTATER SOUNDS LIKE IT MIGHT BE SINCE SOMEONE SAID IT'S FIXING TO SHIP
I LOVE FIRE TEAM ZERO BUT HATE GALAXY DEFENDERS THIS GAME HONESTLY FELL FLAT FOR ONE PRIMARY REASON DEFENSE DICE ARE ROLLED EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF ATTACK DICE

THUS NO MATTER HOW MANY MORE DICE IT FELT KEYWORD FELT THE ENEMY COULD EQUALLY DEFEND AGAINST IT ALL

I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD GAME UNFORTUNATELY THE MECHANICS ARE TOO CLUNKY UPGRADES COME TOO RANDOMLY AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE PERFECT POSITIONING AND ROLL GREAT ATTACKS BUT BECAUSE THE DEFENSE HAS JUST ENOUGH DICE THEY BLOCK IT ALL I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY SWORDS AND SORCERY WILL BE AN IMPROVEMENT TO GALAXY DEFENDERS CORE MECHANICS AS THEY'VE REMOVED THE DEFENSE DICE EQUALS ATTACK DICE ROLLED AND PERHAPS THAT WILL DO BETTER
IT LOOKS FUN IT'S ONE OF THE FEW APP GAMES THAT I THINK I MIGHT WANT
PUBLIC DOMAIN IS WHY WE HAVE CTHULHU GAMES UP TO OUR EYEBALLS GO FOR IT
ANAL BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE SURE THAT THE BOOKS AND CHARACTERS IN QUESTION ARE INDEED PUBLIC DOMAIN IN YOUR COUNTRY YOU SHOULD BE OKAY DISNEY REALLY SCREWED THOSE LAWS UP IN THE USA
PUBLIC DOMAIN IS JUST THAT PUBLIC DOMAIN GO FOR IT MAKE SURE WHAT YOU WANT TO USE IS DEFINITELY PD THOUGH THERE ARE SOME WEIRD SPOTS
JUST MAKE SURE THE THINGS YOUR USING ARE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN VERSION IE IF YOUR MAKING SOMETHING ON OZ DON'T USE RUBY SLIPPERS THEY WERE ADDED FOR THE MOVIE THAT'S NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT LAWS ON WHEN WORKS ARE CONSIDERED IN PUBLIC DOMAIN JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS PUBLIC DOMAIN IN THE US DOES NOT MEAN IT ALSO PUBLIC DOMAIN IN CANADA FOR EXAMPLE WHICH COULD LEAD TO PROBLEMS IN THOSE TERRITORIES TALK TO A REAL LAWYER ANAL IF YOU'RE SERIOUS IT'LL BE EASIER NOW THAN HEADACHES DOWN THE LINE AFTER YOU'VE DUMPED TIME AND MONEY INTO THE PROJECT
I'M NOT SURE BUT PRETTY SURE IT'S OKAY SEE UBIQUITY
PUBLIC DOMAIN YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH

BUT JUST BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL BOOK IS PUBLIC DOMAIN DOESN'T MEAN THAT OTHER MATERIAL THEY'VE ADDED TO A LATER PRINT IS PUBLIC DOMAIN FORWARDS NOTES FROM THE AUTHOR COUNTY WILL BE COVERED BY COPYRIGHT FROM THE MOMENT OF FIRST PUBLISHING TO BE SAFE YOU NEED TO USE AN ORIGINAL WORK YOU CAN USUALLY FIND THESE ON PROJECT GUTENBERG I DON'T BELIEVE STEVE GUTENBERG HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT
THAT'S WHAT THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IS FOR
LOTS OF COOL CHARACTERS ARE AVAILABLE GO FOR IT CTHULHU AND THOR ARE BOTH GOOD FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SHERLOCK HOLMES REVOLTING DETECTIVE GO CRAZY
AS LONG AS ALL THE ASSETS PRIMARILY ART ASSETS ARE ORIGINAL WORKS AND YOU'RE NOT SHARING A STYLIZED LIKENESS OF SOMEONE ELSE I THINK YOU SHOULD BE FINE
PLAYED DEMO GAME AT ESSEN

ARTWORK IS NICE GAMEPLAY IS VERY SIMPLE AND INOFFENSIVE WITHOUT MUCH DEPTH AND A DEEP SCHADENFREUDE WHEN SOMEONE DRAWS A FAT CHOCOBO SO HAS TO END THEIR TURN

IF YOU LIKE CHOCOBOS AND ARE A FF FAN THEN IT'S A RELATIVELY HARMLESS PURCHASE
NO BUT I WANT IT EVEN IF IT IS TERRIBLE CHOCOBO LOVE
I HAVE IT IF YOU HAVE ANY RULES OR COMPONENT QUESTIONS BUT SINCE IT REQUIRES AT MINIMUM I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY JUST YET
I PLAYED THIS LAST LAST NIGHT WITH PEOPLE THE RULES WERE SHORT BUT WELL WRITTEN AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS DIVING RIGHT IN EACH ROUND WAS BETWEEN 2 AND MINUTES THE WHOLE GAME RAN ABOUT MINUTES IT SUPPORTS PLAYERS BUT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PLAY WITH AT LEAST PLAYERS SO YOU KNOW ALL OF THE CRYSTAL TYPES ARE IN PLAY FROM THE BEGINNING MY GROUP TENDS TO GO FOR CO-OP GAMES THIS WAS LIGHT ENOUGH THAT NOBODY GOT THEIR FEELINGS HURT DON'T PLAN AN EVENING AROUND IT BUT IT'S A NICE FILLER GAME AND THE ARTWORK IS BEAUTIFUL
WHAT GAMES WOULD YOU USE THESE WITH
SOUNDS KINDA LIKE NEXUS OPS
I TOO AM INTERESTED IN SEEING THESE WORKING ON A THING SO IF ANYONE KNOWS OF A LINK THAT WOULD BE SWELL
THIS MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

IF YOU CAN TRACE A LINE FROM ANY POINT IN YOUR HEX TO ANY POINT IN THE HEX WITHOUT CROSSING A HIGHER SPACE IN THE MIDDLE YOU HAVE LINE OF SIGHT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE FROM CORNERS OR CENTER POINTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

THE HEIGHT IS SOMETIMES COUNTERINTUITIVE CROSSING AN OBSTACLE HIGHER THAN EITHER END BLOCKS LOS IF YOU'RE ON A HEIGHT SPACE AND THE TARGET IS ON A HEIGHT SPACE OR VICE VERSA A 2 HEIGHT SPACE WOULD BLOCK LOS

THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT CAN BLOCK LOS IS JUNGLE TERRAIN THE SPACES OUTLINED IN GREEN
IT DEPENDS IF I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY CONSULT THE RULEBOOK SEARCH ONLINE ETC THEN I CONSIDER IT UNREFINED GAMES LIKE MARKHAM HORROR FIT INTO THIS LOTS OF LITTLE RULES THAT VARY BASED ON PLAYER COUNT ELDRITCH HORROR ON THE OTHER HAND IS FAR IMPROVED ON THIS TOPIC GAMES LIKE THE ALLERGIST HAVE A MILLION LITTLE RULES BUT THE BOARD ARTWORK GAMEPLAY MAKES IT SO EASY TO REMEMBER THAT I HAVE NO QUALMS WITH IT
I'M NOT SURE THERE EXISTS A COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT REFINED UNREFINED MEANS IN THE CONTEXT OF BOARD GAMES WOULDN'T REFINED IMPLY SOME SORT OF IMPROVEMENT UPON A BASELINE MODEL

BUT I WOULD CONSIDER SCYTHE TO BE REFINED BY COMPARISON TO ITS PREDECESSOR EUPHORIA BUILD A BETTER DYSTOPIA BUT COMPARED TO SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE NOT FOR A STANDALONE GAME I'M NOT SURE THE TERM WOULD HAVE ANY REAL MEANING
PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REFINED AND DISTILLED REFINED HAVING ALL THOSE LITTLE RULES AND DISTILLED MEANING THE OPPOSITE IT'S ALL JUST SEMANTICS THOUGH REALLY
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR SPECIFIC VERBIAGE BUT I PERSONALLY PREFER A GAME WITH FEWER RULES AND MORE STRATEGY TO ONE THAT HAS A HUNDRED EDGE CASES PHASES AND UPKEEP STEPS THIS IS WHAT PREVENTS ME FROM BUYING FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES ANYMORE
IT COMPLETELY DEPENDS ON THE GAME AMERITRASH GAMES TEND TO HAVE TONS OF LITTLE RULES ADDED HERE AND THERE FOR THEMATIC REASONS WE TEND TO CALL THOSE CHROME EUROGAMES ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LITTLE NIGGLING RULES FOR BALANCE AS YOU SAID

I USUALLY LIKE GAMES WITH AS FEW LITTLE RULES EXCEPTIONS AS POSSIBLE UNLESS THEY'RE PRETTY EASY TO REMEMBER BRASS IS A GREAT GAME WITH A FEW LITTLE EXTRA RULES BUT THEY'RE PRETTY THEMATIC AND THEY ARE EASY TO REMEMBER ONCE YOU GET GOING MARKHAM HORROR OTOH IS JUST A MIASMA OF A MILLION DIFFERENT LITTLE RULES I DEFY ANYONE TO GET THROUGH ANY OF THEIR FIRST TEN GAMES WITHOUT LOOKING STUFF UP
I'M IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DESIGN A GAME AND I TRIED TO KEEP THE RULES AS SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD AS POSSIBLE BUT THIS HAS CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS AND EDGE CASES TO APPEAR NOW I'M FACED WITH A PROBLEM KEEP THE GENERAL RULES SIMPLICITY BUT ADD IN CLAUSES AND EXCEPTIONS FOR THOSE EDGE CASES OR RESTART AND REBUILD TO TRY ELIMINATE THOSE EDGE CASES

IN THE PAST I MAY HAVE LOOKED AT GAMES WITH SIDE RULES AND LITTLE CLAUSES AS INCONVENIENT AND POSSIBLY BADLY DESIGNED BUT GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS MYSELF I'VE COME TO APPRECIATE THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO AVOID THEM WHEN TRYING TO STAY TRUE TO A VISION BE THAT THEMATIC OR MECHANICAL I'VE COME TO JUST ACCEPT THEM ONE THING YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED IN THE SCYTHE RULEBOOK IS THE FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED RULES PART IF THE GAME INCLUDES SIDE RULES BUT HIGHLIGHTS THEM IN THIS WAY I THINK ALL IS FORGIVEN
IMO IT DEPENDS ON HOW INTUITIVE THE TINY RULES ARE DO THEY MAKE THEMATIC SENSE IS IT SOMETHING YOU FEEL RIGHT DOING THEN IT'S REFINED IF IT FEELS LIKE IT'S TACKED ON BECAUSE IT IS JUST THERE FOR BALANCE OR SOMETHING THEN THAT'S NOT REALLY REFINED
EITHER SUSHI GO OR TWILIGHT IMPERIUM

EDIT FINE FINE FOR REAL ANSWERS TRY DIXIT MYSTERIUM RESISTANCE AVALON KING OF TOKYO OR BUY JACKBOX ON YOUR COMPUTER
DESPITE NEEDING FAR MORE INFORMATION TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION PROPERLY I'LL THROW OUT A GAME THAT FITS A WIDE VARIETY OF PLAYERS AND PLAYER COUNTS DIXIT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT GAMES AND HAS A HARD TIME LEARNING RULES CAN JUMP IN AND ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND SERIOUS GAMERS CAN STILL ENJOY IT IT REALLY WORKS QUICKLY AND EASILY WITH ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS
WELL I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AGES LIKES DISLIKES TIME CONSTRAINTS AND ATTENTION SPANS DISABILITIES SO THE BEST I CAN DO IS OFFER SOME GENERAL SUGGESTIONS

DIXIT HAS GONE OVER WELL WITH MY FAMILY
TICKET TO RIDE IS PRETTY WELL LIKED TOO
DIMMET PLAYS UP TO AND IS SIMILAR ENOUGH TO LOTS OF CARD GAMES THEY MIGHT ALREADY KNOW
CARCASSONNE HAS YET TO DISAPPOINT
CONCEPT HAS BEEN A FAVORITE FOR MY FAMILY AT RECENT GATHERINGS SOMETHING SIMPLER TO PLAY AND EXPLAIN WOULD BE CODENAMES WITH FAMILY OR GUESTS I AIM FOR SIMPLICITY IN RULES AND MATERIALS AND A LOT OF PLAYER INTERACTIVITY
I THINK IT'S JUST ME BUT I'LL MAKE SURE DAYS HITS THE TABLE ON DURING CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS JUST THEMATIC REASONS

BUT CHECK OUT THIS PAGE HERE FOR MORE IDEAS
TELESTRATIONS AFTER DARK
WHAT'S THE PLAYER COUNT BONANZA CODE NAMES DUTCH BLITZ
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF WAS A HUGE SUCCESS WITH THE EXTENDED FAMILY DURING THANKSGIVING DAYBREAK SHOULD ARRIVE TODAY TO ADD TO THE FUN DURING CHRISTMAS
I AM BRINGING SPYFAULT RESISTANCE CODENAMES LANTERNS DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG KING OF TOKYO PANDEMIC AND SUSHI GO I WILL BE STAYING WITH FAMILY FOR A WEEK WHICH IS WHY THE LIST IS SO LONG
I'M PLANNING TO PLAY SMALL WORLD WHEN I GO HOME FOR CHRISTMAS USUALLY I PLAY WITH MY WIFE AND YEAR OLD SON LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING WITH A LARGER GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY STRATEGIZE ALSO ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF AGAIN I USUALLY PLAY WITH MY WIFE YEAR OLD AND YEAR OLD I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY THE GAMES I LIKE WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY
DIXIT TELESTRATIONS PARTY PACK CODENAMES SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS AND CONCEPT ARE GOOD GAMES TO GO WITH I'D RECOMMEND PAPERBACK IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PLAYERS OR LESS
I'M GONNA PICK UP PANDEMIC LEGACY AND SEE HOW MUCH YOU OF IT WE CAN GO THROUGH
THERE'S A VAST AMOUNT OF GAMES STYLES TIME RANGES AND PLAYERS COUNTS YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC
RULEBOOKS TELL YOU WHAT TO REPLACE WITH WHAT

FROM MY POINT OF VIEW HQ ADDS MINOR FIXES THAT REALLY IMPROVE THE GAME WHEREAS RECON IS MORE TYPICAL DECKBUILDER EXPANSION OF MORE AND DIFFERENT EVERYTHING I VIEW HQ ALMOST AS A NECESSITY AND RECON IS COOL ENOUGH IF YOU'RE INTO THAT SORT OF THING THEY WORK WELL TOGETHER IF YOU'RE DIGGING AROUND AND MANAGE TO FIND AN OLD VERSION OF THE GAME WITHOUT ANY EXPANSIONS I'D PASS AS HQ REALLY HELPS IT

IF YOU'RE GETTING IT RETAIL ODDS ARE AT LEAST HQ IS INCLUDED MOST LIKELY HQ AND RECON
MY FAVORITE GAMES ARE MARGI PATCHWORK AND WONDERS DUEL
WELCOME TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MODERN BOARD GAMING


SINCE YOU'RE RELATIVELY NEW TO THE HOBBY BELOW ARE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE THE CLASSIC OR AT LEAST MODERN CLASSIC 2 PLAYER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL ENSURE YOU BOTH HAVE A TON OF FUN WITHOUT OVERWHELMING YOU


JAIPUR A FANTASTIC CARD GAME THAT HAS YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT TRYING TO MAKE SMART TRADES TO CREATE EFFICIENT SETS OF COMMODITIES THAT CAN THEN BE SOLD FOR A PREMIUM GREAT FUN AND A MODERN CLASSIC


HIVE GAMES TEND TO VEER TOWARDS THE ABSTRACT END OF THE SPECTRUM I EAST WITHOUT MUCH OF A THEME AND THIS GAME STANDS TALL AMONG THE OTHERS IN THE GENRE A LOT OF PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS INSECT CHESS BUT DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU AWAY THIS IS A FANTASTIC STRATEGIC TILE LAYING GAME THAT IS WELL-REGARDED BY MANY GAMERS


PANDEMIC IT ISN'T TWO PLAYER ONLY PLAYS UP TO BUT IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL COOPERATIVE GAME YOU THINK COMPETING IS FUN TRY WORKING TOGETHER TO RID THE WORLD OF NASTY DISEASES


BATTLE LINE SIMPLE YET DEEPLY STRATEGIC THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES EVER MADE BY ONE OF THE GREATEST BOARD GAME DESIGNERS REINER KNIAZI YOU ARE COMPETING WITH YOUR OPPONENT TO MAKE SETS OF CARDS TO CLAIM FLAGS ON THE BATTLE LINE SO ELEGANT AND SO GOOD


HOPE THAT HELPS LET US KNOW WHAT YOU FINALLY DECIDED TO PLAY BUY AND HOW YOU ENJOYED THE GAMES HAVE FUN
CHECK OUT THE PSIG SECTION OF THE WIKI IT HAS AN ENTIRE SECTION ON 2 PLAYER GAMES

KNOWING NOTHING ELSE ABOUT YOUR TASTES I'D SUGGEST JAIPUR PATCHWORK AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES BIG AND SMALL PANDEMIC AND DOMINION
SO MANT CHOICES OF AMAZING 2 PLAYER GAMES HERE'S A FEW OF MY AV
ONITAMA OR THE DUKE ARE GOOD CHESS LIKE GAMES ARMADA IS GOOD IF YOU LIKE FIGHTING WITH SHIPS ALTHOUGH CAN BE FIDDLY JAIPUR IS A GREAT CARD GAME THAT PLAYS IN LESS THAN MINUTES
MY SO AND I PLAY ALL OUR GAMES JUST THE 2 OF US SOME OF OUR FAVORITES ARE

SHORTER GAMES HANAFI STAR REALMS FLASH POINT FIRE RESCUE SUSHI GO DUNGEONQUEST

MID LENGTH GAMES MARKHAM HORROR CG PANDEMIC GALAXY TRUCKER

LONGER GAMES FORBIDDEN STARS ELDRITCH HORROR MERCHANTS AND MARAUDERS DESCENT MARKHAM HORROR TALES OF ARABIAN KNIGHTS DEAD OF WINTER
FORBIDDEN ISLAND
FORBIDDEN DESERT
MICE MYSTICS
LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL
FLASHPOINT
LEGENDARY MARVEL

THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS ALWAYS PATCHWORK AND BOY DOES IT GET ASKED A LOT
SEEMS PRETTY SIMILAR TO THE DOWNFALL OF POMPEII BUT WITHOUT THE MOVEMENT
IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY ABSTRACT GAME
WOW THE VOICE OVER ON THAT VIDEO WAS INFURIATING COULDN'T EVEN LISTEN THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH
R BOARDGAMES WIKI PSIG
I'LL RECOMMEND A COUPLE IN DIFFERENT GENRES

PARTY GAME CODENAMES AND DEEP SEA ADVENTURE

BLUFFING SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM COUP AND THE RESISTANCE AVALON

STRATEGY CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AND WONDERS

ALL OF THESE ARE EASY TO LEARN AND WON'T COST YOU MORE THAN BUCKS OR SO

HAPPY GAMING
WOULD ALL THE PLAYERS DO THE SAME THING BUY LOW GET CONTRACTS SELL HIGH GET END GAME BONUSES

I'VE ONLY PLAY THE ALLERGIST TIMES BUT THE GAME IS MORE TACTICAL THAN STRATEGIC YES IN A BROAD SENSE YOU WANT TO BUY LOW AND SELL HIGH BUT A HUGE PART OF THE GAME IS THE ENTIRE KICKBACK ACTION MECHANIC ESSENTIALLY YOU ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF KICKBACK ACTIONS AND TO DENY YOUR OPPONENTS THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IF YOU DO THIS EFFICIENTLY YOU WILL ESSENTIALLY HAVE MORE ACTIONS THAN YOUR OPPONENT AND WILL DO MUCH BETTER

BUT THESE DECISIONS ARE FAR FROM EASY AND IS WHAT MAKES THE GAME SO ATTRACTIVE FURTHERMORE THESE DECISIONS ARE VERY SITUATIONAL SOMETIMES TAKING A KICKBACK ACTION IS AND OTHER TIMES NOT GIVING YOUR OPPONENT A KICKBACK ACTION WILL BE A HUGE HINDRANCE TO YOURSELF AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS ENCOURAGES PLAYERS TO FOCUS ON EACH OTHER WHICH MAKES IT FEEL MORE INTERACTIVE THAN YOUR TYPICAL EURO

ANOTHER THING THAT SHOULD BE MENTIONED IS THAT CAN BE MANIPULATED BY PLAYERS AND THIS HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT SO THOUGHTFUL PLAYERS WILL SPEED SLOW THE PACE OF THE GAME AND INTERMITTENT SCORING WHICH CAN INJECT A BUNCH OF CASH INFLUENCE INTO THE GAME IN ORDER TO HURT THEIR OPPONENTS IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE HOW INFLUENTIAL THIS CAN BE BUT TRUST ME IT'S IMPORTANT

LASTLY THE BONUSES WILL GIVE YOU CASH INFLUENCE ETC THESE AREN'T INSIGNIFICANT AT ALL GENERALLY THERE IS A FAIRLY STRONG RACE ELEMENT TO OBTAIN THEM AND OF COURSE PLAYERS NEED TO BALANCE OBTAINING THOSE AT THE EXPENSE OF NOT OBTAINING SOMETHING ELSE SOONER

IN THE END THE GAME DOES HAVE A EURO FEEL BUT OBTAINING THOSE VP EFFICIENTLY IS THE PUZZLE GAME AND HIGHLY VARIABLE DEPENDING ON PLAYERS ACTIONS IF YOU LIKE HEAVIER EUROS I THINK YOU WILL LIKE THIS

PLUS IF SOMEONE BREAKS INTO YOUR HOUSE YOU CAN USE THE BOX AS A WEAPON IT'S BIG HEAVY





EDIT I NOTICED YOU HAVE AN ORLEANS TAG NEAR YOUR NAME ODDLY ENOUGH I ALSO PLAYED THAT TIMES NOW I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BEST IDEA TO COMPARE THESE TWO EUROS THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT BUT FOR ME THE WOW FACTOR WITH ORLEANS HAS DROPPED SOME I STILL RATE THEM SIMILARLY BUT I FIND ORLEANS TO BE LESS INTERACTIVE AND ONE OF THOSE GAMES WHERE YOU CAN DO YOUR OWN THING WITH A MODEST CONSIDERATION ABOUT OTHER PLAYERS IN THE ALLERGIST YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT OTHER PLAYERS ARE DOING TO PLAY EFFICIENTLY IT DEFINITELY SEEMS LIKE THE DEEPER GAME

THAT BEING SAID ORLEANS IS A WONDERFUL GAME THAT IS JUST EASY TO PLAY SO IF I'VE BEEN WORKING ALL DAY AND JUST WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING QUICK I WOULD PROBABLY PLAY ORLEANS BEFORE THE ALLERGIST BUT IF I HAD THE WEEKEND OFF AND WANTED SOMETHING TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT ALLERGIST WOULD BE MY PICK
AS YOU'VE SAID THE GENERAL FLOW OF THE GAME IS BUY LOW SELL HIGH USE TICKETS SEND ASSISTANTS WIN AUCTION COMPLETE OBJECTIVES THE REPLACEABILITY COMES FROM TACTICAL DECISIONS AND READING INTO YOUR OPPONENT'S AGENDA

EXAMPLES OF DECISIONS YOU WILL BE FACING

I'VE BOUGHT THIS PAINTING AT DO I SELL IT NOW AT TO GET THE CASH IN ORDER TO HIRE MORE ASSISTANTS OR DO I PUSH ITS VALUE UP TO
OPPONENT X IS CERTAINLY GOING TO PROMOTE THE PHOTOGRAPHER SOON SHOULD I GRAB ONE OF THE ARTWORK TO PIGGY BACK OR USE THAT ACTION SPACE NOW FOR A POTENTIAL BONUS ACTION

IN ESSENCE THERE WON'T BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AS IT'S A TACTICAL GAME PLAN TURNS AHEAD WITH AN INITIAL NUDGE TOWARDS CERTAIN DIRECTIONS
GUESS I SHOULD GRAB THE ONLY COPY AT MY FAGS WHILE I CAN ITS KINDA ROUGH PAYING FOR ONE GAME THOUGH
MY ONLY WORRY WITH ANIS IS THE REVIEW OF ALL THE GAMES YOU LIKE ARE BAD WHY WELL PRIMARILY BECAUSE HE MAKES SOME REALLY SHARP OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE GAME THAT MIGHT BE WORTH TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

GRANTED SAME ARGUMENTS MIGHT APPLY TO BLOOD RAGE

I ALSO HAVE ANIS ON MY SHELF HAD TO ORDER IT FROM UNITED STATES SINCE EUROPEAN DELIVERIES GOT DELAYED UNTIL NEXT YEAR I HOPE TO PLAY IT SOON BUT OVERALL I DO ADORE THE THEME AND MECHANISMS SEEM LIKE A GOOD BUNDLE OF NEW TAKES ON KNOWN MECHANISMS

BUT I DON'T THINK FINISH IS DEEPER THAN BLOOD RAGE BLOOD RAGE HAS A MULTILAYERED FACTION DEVELOPMENT WHICH ENHANCES CARDS AND OTHER MECHANISMS AND PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE GAME THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THAT IN ANIS THOUGH I ASSUME THERE WILL BE ONCE IT WILL HAVE AN INEVITABLE EXPANSION LIKE OTHER MARTAGON GAMES
HOW IS THIS WITH 2 I PLAY BLOOD RAGE WITH 2 REGULARLY AND WE ENJOY IT A TON IM LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT NOT COMPLICATED
PERSONALLY I LIKE BLOOD RAGE OVER ANIS BUT THAT MAY HAVE TO DO WITH THE KIND OF PLAYERS THAT YOU PLAY WITH

YOU CAN ARGUE THAT ANIS IS DEEPER OR HEAVIER THAN BLOOD RAGE BUT THE GAMES ARENT EVEN THAT SIMILAR TO BEGIN WITH THE ONLY COMPARISON BEING THAT ITS A DUDES ON A BOARD TYPE OF GAME

BLOOD RAGE FOCUSES ALOT ON CONFLICT BETWEEN OTHER PLAYERS AND THE WHOLE GAME IS CENTERED ON HOW YOU CHOOSE YOUR FIGHTS MAKING IT AN EXCELLENT COMBAT GAME WITH PLAYERS WHO LIKE CONFRONTATION VICTORY IN BLOOD RAGE IS BY POINTS ON COMBAT WHILE ANIS IS ABOUT WHO HAS THE MOST OBJECTIVES FINISHED MAKING IT SEEM LIKE A EURO RACE COMBAT DOESNT OCCUR MUCH IN ANIS EITHER

WHILE SOME WOULD NOT WANT TO PUT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME INTO LEARNING CARD SYNERGIES AND DRAFT OPTIONS BLOOD RAGE TRULY SHINES AFTER MULTIPLE PLAYS WITH THE SAME GROUP OF PEOPLE WHEN EVERYONE KNOWS HOW THEY WANT TO BUILD THEIR CLANS AND THE KINDS OF CARD DRAFTING THEY WANT OR IS AVAILABLE TO THEM YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF DEPTH AND REPLAY ABILITY TO THE BOARD

F THE KS EXCLUSIVES AND THE IMBALANCE THEY BRING TO THE BOARD THOUGH NO DEFENDING THAT ITS BETTER TO PLAY WITHOUT THEM
I WOULD LOVE ANIS IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THE GAME TAKES TOO LONG FOR MY GROUP BUT FOR THOSE WHO DON'T MIND THE EXTRA DURATION I THINK IT'S A SOLID BUY
WHEN YOU SAY THAT ANIS IS HEAVIER AND DEEPER THAN BLOOD RAGE IS IT ALSO MORE DIFFICULT TO TEACH TO NEW GAMERS
BEEN THINKING ABOUT SELLING BLOOD RAGE DESPITE NOT HAVING PLAYED IT A LOT YET I FEEL LIKE BETWEEN EMET ANIS AND POSSIBLY RISING SUN THERE WON'T BE SPACE FOR IT IN MY BOARD GAME VALHALLA AS SU SD PUT IT
ATTRITIONAL COMBAT ALONE MAKES ME TOTALLY UNINTERESTED IN THIS GAME

THE AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL TILE DESIGN IS BAD TOO WHY ON EARTH WOULD SOMEONE DESIGN TERRAIN SO THAT THE ART HAS HORIZON LINES THAT WILL BE ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT THE ANTIQUATED COMBAT IS EVEN WORSE
BLOOD RAGE HAS SOME REALLY COOL MINIS
AH DICE TOWERS SO MANY GAMERS OWN THEM AND SO FEW OF THOSE OWNERS USE THEM
I'M WONDERING IF LARGER DICE LIKE IN KING OF TOKYO WILL FIT INSIDE
THAT'S PRETTY NEAT WISH I COULD WELD
HE BUILT IT IN A CAVE WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS

SERIOUSLY LOOKS NICE DUDE G
THAT'S REALLY COOL I LIKE HOW CASUALLY YOU JUST THREW IT TOGETHER FROM SCRAP LIKE IT WAS NOTHING EXCELLENT WORK
THIS IS AWESOME FOR SOME REASON I ORIGINALLY READ THE TITLE AS SCRAPS FROM MY GARBAGE AND THOUGHT OF WILTED CABBAGE AND CHICKEN BONES SO YOUR END RESULT WAS QUITE THE SURPRISE
HOW HEAVY IS IT
CHECK OUT SKULLS EASY TO TEACH LEARN AND CAN BE HANDMADE WITHOUT ANY LARGE TIME DEVOTED TO MAKING IT
COCKROACH POKER HAS BEEN MY GAME EASY TO TEACH AND DOESN'T OVERSTAY ITS WELCOME IT DOESN'T FEEL TOO BAD WHEN YOU LOSE AND THERE ARE FUN MOMENTS WHEN EVERYONE AT THE TABLE BUT YOU KNOWS WHAT THE CARD IS

I LOVE COUP BUT COCKROACH POKER REPLACED IT AS OUR BLUFFING GATEWAY GAME

LOVE LETTER IS LESS A BLUFFING GAME AND MORE ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHAT CARDS THE OTHER PLAYERS HAVE BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION IT'S STILL A FUN GAME BUT MAYBE THAT'S NOT QUITE WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND

FINALLY A GAME THAT ONLY WORKS WITH THREE PLAYERS IS WIN LOSE BANANA IT'S SILLY YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN DECK BY WRITING THOSE WORDS ON THREE COASTERS AT A BAR
SECRET HITLER AND DON'T GET ATED ARE DELICIOUS BLUFFING GAMES WITH GOOD PNP FILES I ESPECIALLY RECOMMEND THE LATTER
TRY SPYFAULT EVERYBODY EXCEPT ONE THE SPY IS GIVEN A CARD WITH THE SAME EXACT LOCATION EAST G AIRPLANE CRUISE SHIP ZOO BUSINESS PARTY YOU TAKE TURNS ASKING EACH OTHER QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THE ONE PERSON WHO HAS NO IDEA WHERE YOU GUYS ARE AND IS JUST TRYING TO BS HIS WAY THROUGH IT THE CATCH IS NOBODY WANTS TO BE TOO OBVIOUS WITH THEIR ANSWERS OR QUESTIONS BECAUSE IF THE SPY GUESSES WHERE YOU ARE HE WINS

YOU CAN EVEN TRY IT FREE ONLINE IF EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN SMART PHONE
IT WOULD BE TRIVIAL TO MAKE YOUR OWN VERSION OF THE RESISTANCE AND THAT WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATION

COUP IS GREAT TOO THOUGH
COUP IS FANTASTIC AND AROUND THE EDITION ADDS A TON OF VARIETY AND RUNS ABOUT
COUP IS GREAT CITADELS IS ALSO A GREAT OPTION ALSO I WOULD RECOMMEND CONSIDERING LOVE LETTER
PLENTY OF GOOD SUGGESTIONS HERE ESPECIALLY THE RESISTANCE AND SKULLS SINCE THEY'RE EASILY PLAYED WITH A DECK OF CARDS SO I THOUGHT I'D THROW IN LIAR'S DICE WHICH JUST REQUIRES YOU TO SCROUNGE UP DICE PER PLAYER YOU DON'T EVEN NEED CUPS REALLY
SECRET HITLER WORKS WELL AT IT'S PRINT AND PLAY ADAMIK AT LEAST THE COPY I PLAYED WAS PRINTED
THE RESISTANCE IS A GOOD SUGGESTION I WOULD ALSO ADD SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM IT'S A GOOD BLUFFING CARD GAME
SECRET HITLER

LIGHT ON RULES MINUTE GAME
TWO ROOMS AND A BOOM YOU DO NEED AT LEAST BUT YOU CAN PRINT AND PLAY
HEY THERE I HONESTLY THINK WE SHOULD GET MEDALS FOR PURSUING THIS HOBBY IN INDIA

SO AFTER SCOURING THROUGH MY OPTIONS ONLINE I CHANCED UPON WHICH IS UK BASED JUST LAST MONTH THEY'VE UPPED THEIR SHIPPING CHARGES FROM GOP TO GOP PER ITEM WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT TOO BAD GIVEN IT'S STILL SUB RS FOR DELIVERY HAVING SAID THAT THE GAME PRICES THEMSELVES AREN'T COMPARABLE TO THE MINIATUREMARKETS AND COOLSTUFFINCS WHICH ARE WAY CHEAPER BUT IT STILL WORKS OUT CHEAPER THAN OUR DOMESTIC ALTERNATIVES SO HURRAH

THEY HAVE A SISTER STOREFRONT OZGAMESSHOP WHICH USUALLY STOCKS THE SAME GAMES AT MARGINALLY HIGHER PRICES BUT THE SITE COMES WITH FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING FOR LARGE ORDERS HAVE A LOOK
YOU DON'T HAVE TOO MANY OPTIONS U HEARTH THERE'S ALTHOUGH THEY'RE QUITE EXPENSIVE AND WHICH ISN'T MUCH CHEAPER THAT SAID THEY DO OCCASIONALLY HAVE SALES AND SOMETIMES THEIR PRICES AREN'T TOO UNREASONABLE THAT'S IT AS FAR AS I KNOW

SOME STORES DO STOCK BOARDGAMES THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE STARMARK IN CHENNAI HAS A SELECTION NOT CHEAP
I AGREE THAT IT'S A GREAT GAME FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH ALTHOUGH THEIR COMMUNICATION ISN'T GOOD THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT AND TAKE TIME TO DEVELOPER SOMETHING THAT INTEGRATES REALLY WELL WITH THE ESTABLISHED LINE IT'S WHAT HAS LED TO DELAYS BUT I'D RATHER SEE DELAYS FOR A FULLY REALIZED PROJECT
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER HOVERCRAFT GAMES ALWAYS LACK THAT SPECIAL GO INSANE THINKING ABOUT THE VAST HORROR OF THE COSMOS INGREDIENT THAT IS THE CORE IDEA OF EVERYTHING HOVERCRAFT EVER WROTE OTHER THAN YOU KNOW IMPLICIT RACISM

EXCEPT HERE'S A CARD THAT YOU CHOOSE TO PUT IN YOUR DECK THAT DOES NOTHING OR DOES IT

I SERIOUSLY HOPE THEY STRING US ALONG AND NEVER DO ANYTHING WITH THIS CARD AND ITS CAMPAIGN BOOK ENTRY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE SO PERFECTLY LOVECRAFTIAN
IF THIS SOLUTION BECOMES IMPORTANT LATER IN THE CYCLE IT COULD BE AMAZING

DONT GIVE FFA ARTICLES TOO MUCH CREDIT GOING BY PAST GAMES ARTICLES
ONE NOTE MY GROUP HATES THE WHOLE CROSSROADS RESOLVE THE TRIAL PORTION OF THE EXODUS EXPANSION AND WE NEVER USE THAT MODULE THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE COULD GO THROUGH THE WHOLE HOUR GAME ONLY TO GET COMPLETELY ELIMINATED AT THE CLIMAX THAT'S JUST UNFORGIVABLE FROM A DESIGN STANDPOINT IMO

WE STILL USE THE ALLY CARDS ANYWAY JUST TO ADD SOME FLAVOR AND INTERESTING DECISIONS
IONIAN NEBULA AND ALLIES ARE THE ONLY PARTS OF EXODUS THAT I NO LONGER USE EVER THE IONIAN NEBULA CAN ELIMINATE A PLAYER AT THE VERY END OF THE GAME AND THAT BUAT SUCKS THE ALLIES BASICALLY TURNED INTO HAZARD ZONES PLAYERS NEVER WANTED TO GO THERE BECAUSE SOMETHING BAD COULD HAPPEN AND IT WASN'T WORTH THE COIN TOSS

I LIKE FINAL FIVE AND PERSONAL GOALS BECAUSE THEY GIVE HUMANS A REASON TO HIDE WHICH MAKES FINDING THE REAL CLONS HARDER
DESPITE THE SHIT U DRAKKOS HAS TAKEN FOR THEM THEIR ACCESSIBILITY TEARDOWNS ARE GREAT SPLENDOR FOR EXAMPLE AND HAVE SPREAD AWARENESS OF ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES FOR ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE AMONG CONSUMERS DESIGNERS AND PUBLISHERS
CATARACT SURGERY FOR EVEN ONE EYE IS BOTH RELATIVELY MINOR AND INCREDIBLY LIFE CHANGING

AS WE AGE HOWEVER WE ALL GET FARSIGHTED THEY PROBABLY SUFFER FROM GAMES ARE AT A POOR LENGTH FOR VISION TOO FAR FOR READING GLASSES TOO CLOSE FOR NORMAL FAR-SIGHTED VISION
IN MY EXPERIENCE A LOT OF THE DIFFICULTY DISTINGUISHING PIECES IS ALLEVIATED THROUGH EXPOSURE AS SOMEONE PLAYS THE GAME THEY ESSENTIALLY TRAIN THEMSELVES TO BE BETTER AT TELLING PIECES APART

GIVEN THAT YOUR PARENTS ARE SHARP AND HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH EXPOSURE TO THE GAMES I AM RETICENT TO SAY THAT THIS ISN'T THE CASE FOR THEM AS WELL
THANKS FOR THE BREAKDOWN THIS ONE HAS BEEN ON MY RADAR FOR A WHILE BUT I'VE BEEN UNIMPRESSED BY OTHER CO-OP DECKBUILDERS I'VE TRIED XENOSHYFT SHADOWRIFT LEGENDARY SO I WAS TALKING MYSELF OUT OF IT DESPITE THE OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE PRELIMINARY REVIEWS THIS HAS REKINDLED MY INTEREST
RECEIVED THIS A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND GOT A 2 PLAYER GAME IN THIS WEEKEND MY WIFE AND I REALLY LIKED IT WHILE NOT GROUNDBREAKING IT TAKES ALL THE BEST ELEMENTS FROM OTHER DECK BUILDERS AND CO-OP DECK BUILDERS AND ADDS JUST ENOUGH TWEAKS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO READY A SPELL A TURN BEFORE YOU CAST IT ALONG WITH THE RANDOM TURN ORDER ADDS ENOUGH STRATEGY TO MAKE THIS GAME FRESH THIS LEADS TO SOME TENSE CHOICES WHERE YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A FEW RISKS HOPING YOU GET YOUR TURNS IN BEFORE THE BIG BAD

I AM NOT SURE IF THIS WILL WIN OVER PEOPLE THAT DO NOT LIKE THE GENRE BUT THERE IS ENOUGH NEW HERE TO BRING PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE SOME FATIGUE FOR THE GENRE BACK TO THE TABLE THIS IS PROBABLY 2ND TO ONLY BLOOD RAGE AS MY FAVORITE GAME I HAVE BACKED ON KS
HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE IT TO THE OTHER 2 NEW DECKBUILDING GAMES OF CLANK AND TYRANTS OF THE UNDERMARK
ARE THE COMPONENTS AS TERRIBLE AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED
I LISTENED TO A RECENT SHUT UP SIT DOWN PODCAST AND QUINAS SAID IT WAS GREAT BUT THE EXPERIENCE WAS MARRED BY REALLY BAD PRODUCTION QUALITY ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT
IM SO PUMPED FOR THIS GAME I THINK IT MIGHT BE AT THE TOP OF MY LIST

I ALSO WANT TO GRAB THE BIG BOOK OF MADNESS

I LOVE STAR REALMS AND I LOVE COOP GAMES CAN NOT WAIT TO PLAY THESE

I MIGHT ASK FOR THEM FOR CHRISTMAS
I WAS GETTING INTERESTED IN THIS GAME BUT THEN I SAW THAT THERE IS BACKER EXCLUSIVE CONTENTION THE GREATLY REDUCED MY DESIRE TO GIVE THEM MY MONEY FOR AN INFERIOR VERSION

ALSO COULD SOMEONE WHO FOLLOWED THE KICKSTARTER TELL ME THE SITE IS WORDED AS IF THE DECISION TO NOT INCLUDE STRETCH GOALS IN RETAIL VERSIONS WAS MADE AFTER THE FACT RATHER THAN PLANNED FROM THE BEGINNING I WANT TO CHECK IF THIS IS THE CASE BECAUSE IF SO THIS IS EVEN SCUMMIER BUT I WANT TO GET THE FACTS BEFORE FULLY JUDGING
I'D LOVE FOR MY KS COPY TO SHIP AT SOME POINT SOON EVERYONE ELSE SEEMS TO BE GETTING THEIR COPIES AND MINE HASN'T EVEN LEFT THE WAREHOUSE YET
STILL EAGERLY WAITING FOR MY KS TO COME IN HOPEFULLY THIS WEEK

I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THE COMPARISONS TO SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE SINCE THAT GAME DIDN'T IMPRESS ME MUCH BUT I'M OPTIMISTIC THE DECKBUILDER MECHANISMS OF THIS GAME WILL MAKE IT BETTER
NOT HEARD MANY PEOPLE DISCUSS THIS ONE EVEN WITH SOME POSITIVE REVIEWS FROM THE BIG REVIEWERS
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT GAME DESIGN AND PUTTING MY BRAIN INTO THAT ZONE THE MORE I GET MOMENTS WHERE I THINK I THOUGHT OF THAT

YOUR DECK IS NEVER SHUFFLED IF YOU DRAW YOUR LAST CARD YOU FLIP YOUR DISCARD OVER DONE

FAIR PLAY ACTION PHASE GAMES YOU TOOK THE IDEA AND MADE IT WORK HOPE TO TRY THIS SOON
DECEMBER IS SET TO BE A GOOD MONTH FOR DECK BUILDERS AT MY HOUSE I SHOULD BE RECEIVING THIS AND XENOSHYFT PREADMIRE THEN SOMETIME LATER HOPEFULLY NOT TOO MUCH LATER HEART OF CROWN
THANKS FOR THE WRITE UP LOOKING FORWARD TO IT EVEN MORE NOW
I THINK THIS GAME SOUNDS GREAT AND HAVE LOOSELY FOLLOWED IT I RECENTLY PLAYED THE HARRY POTTER COOP DECK BUILDER AND REALLY ENJOYED IT DESPITE NEVER SEEING HP

I WAS LOOKING TO ADD MARVEL LEGENDARY AS MY COOP DECK BUILDER THIS HOLIDAY BUT SHOULD I WAIT FOR THIS GAME INSTEAD I'M A HUGE MARVEL FAN AND THERE ARE EXPANSIONS UP THE BAZOO FOR EVERY CHARACTER WHICH IS GREAT BUT IF THAT GAME LACKS IN CERTAIN AREAS AND END EXCELS I'D RATHER PICK THAT UP

THOUGHTS
GLAD TO HEAR YOU LIKE IT I SHOULD BE GETTING MY COPY IN THE NEXT DAY OR 2 HERE I DON'T OWN ANY DECK BUILDING GAMES YET GLAD TO HEAR THIS PULLS THE BEST ASPECTS OF A LOT OF GAMES AND TIES THEM INTO ONE
GOOD TO SEE SOME LOVE FOR AEONS END

THE ARTWORK WASN'T AS BAD AS I HEARD AND REALLY LOOKED MUCH BETTER ONCE I GOT MY HANDS ON THE CARDS

THERE IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENT IN THAT BOX TOO CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY MY FIRST GAME SOON

MY ONLY GRIPE SO FAR IS THAT THE INSERT IS TERRIBLE
JUST GOT MY COPY AND I MUST SAY THIS GAME IS AWESOME

I TYPICALLY HATE CO-OP GAMES AND COULD NOT THINK THAT CO-OP DECKBUILDERS WOULD BE A GOOD GENRE BUT THIS HAS CONVINCED ME OTHERWISE FUN AND CHALLENGING GAME
BETWEEN FOE HUNTERS AND HERO REALMS I HAVE MY SHARE OF CO-OP DECK BUILDERS FOR THE TIME BEING ALSO WATCHING RUN THROUGH DURING THE CAMPAIGN DID NOT REALLY INSPIRE ME TO BACK IT

ONE OF MY FRIENDS DID SO I WILL GET A CHANCE TO TRY IT WHEN I NEXT SEE HIM
I HAVE ONE BIG PROBLEM WITH CO-OP DECKBUILDERS THAT JUST BOTHERS ME TO NO END TYPICALLY

YOUR NEXT MOVE IS USUALLY OBVIOUS AND EVERYONE RARELY NEEDS TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER MORE OFTEN EVERYONE IS JUST INDIVIDUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE SAME GOAL

IS THIS GAME SIMILAR IN THAT REGARD OR ARE THERE TOUGH DECISIONS AND ROLES THAT NEED TO BE FILLED BY THE TEAM
A BUNCH OF KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVES INCLUDING TWO NEMESISES SP ARE KEEPING ME FROM IMPULSE BUYING THE GAME I'VE PLAYED IT SHORTLY AT SPIEL BUT I FEEL I MISS OUT ON THE COMPLETE EXPERIENCE BY PURCHASING IT AT RETAIL
I'VE ONLY PLAYED IT OR TIMES BUT HAVE REALLY ENJOYED IT EVERY TIME IT TAKES VERY LITTLE EXPLAINING OR SET UP SO ITS A REALLY EASY ONE TO PULL OUT AND ALWAYS PRODUCES A FEW LAUGHS FROM OUR GROUP ALWAYS ENDS IN A BIT OF CHAOS
I LOVE THE PROGRAMMING UNDER PRESSURE STYLE OF PLAY AND THE LAST MINUTE PANIC ACTION DROPPING ALWAYS SEEM TO CREATE SOME FUN SITUATIONS I KNOW QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO LIKE IT BUT I HAVE FUN THEN AGAIN MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE I SEEM TO BE QUITE GOOD AT IT I'VE WON EVERY GAME SO FAR
I DIDN'T REALISE THERE WERE DIFFERENT VERSIONS THOUGH ARE THE CONTENTS MUCH DIFFERENT
IT'S FUN

I LIKE IT AS A FREE FOR ALL NOT AS A OH MAN LET'S ALL SIT HERE QUIETLY AND THINK OUT WHAT TO DO JUST LETTING THINGS GO FAST AND FURIOUS IS MY PREFERRED WAY OF PLAYING BUSTING OUT THE SAND TIMER AND THEN MAKING GOOD-NATURED JABS AT ANYONE WHO IS GETTING FLUSTERED AS THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO PLAY
DELETED
I'LL ALWAYS HAVE A SOFT SPOT FOR ROBORALLY IT'S A GAME I WAS INTRODUCED TO MAYBE YEARS OR SO AGO WAY BEFORE I GOT INTO BOARD GAMING AS A HOBBY

I DON'T THINK THERE'S THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VERSIONS THE NEWER ONES HAVE A BOARD THAT'S A STARTING AREA FOR PLAYERS ORIGINALLY WE USED TO JUST START AT THE FIRST CHECKPOINT THE STARTING AREA BOARD MAKES THINGS A LITTLE BIT SIMPLER SINCE IF EVERYONE STARTS AT THE FIRST CHECKPOINT ALL THE ROBOTS HAVE TO START VIRTUAL WHICH IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND EXPLAIN THAT OFTEN OTHERWISE

THE ONE I HAVE ALSO CAME WITH A SAND TIMER THE OFFICIAL RULE IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IS THAT THE FIRST PERSON TO FINISH PROGRAMMING THEIR TURN STARTS THE TIMER IF SOMEONE DOESN'T FINISH PROGRAMMING THEIR TURN BEFORE THE TIMER RUNS OUT THEN THEIR UNFINISHED MOVES ARE DRAWN RANDOMLY FROM THE CARDS THEY HAVE LEFT

I USUALLY PLAY WITHOUT THE TIMER IF PEOPLE TAKE WAY TOO LONG ON THEIR TURNS AND THEY'VE PLAYED BEFORE I CAN SEE USING IT THOUGH

I LIKE THE PROGRAMMING ASPECT OF IT A LOT IT'S ALSO MORE FUN WITH MORE PLAYERS SINCE YOU GET IN EACH WAY THE PRIORITIES OF YOUR CARDS CAN BECOME IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO MESS WITH SOMEONE OR AVOID SOMEONE SOME PEOPLE FIND THIS SIDE OF IT FRUSTRATING

IT DOES SUFFER A BIT FROM A RUNAWAY LEADER ESPECIALLY IF ONE PERSON IS WAY AHEAD AND EVERYONE ELSE IS IN EACH WAY I'VE SEEN A GOOD SUGGESTION ON BG TO HELP MITIGATE THIS YOU PLACE A DIE ON EACH CHECKPOINT WITH A NUMBER FACE UP EG EVERY TIME THE DIE IS SHOT WITH A ROBOT'S LASER YOU TURN THE DIE TO SUBTRACT FROM IT ONCE IT REACHES THE DIE IS REMOVED AND THE CHECKPOINT IS ACCESSIBLE UNTIL THEN THE DIE IS LIKE A WALL I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY TRIED PLAYING WITH THIS RULE SINCE UNFORTUNATELY ROBORALLY DOESN'T GET A LOT OF PLAY IN MY GROUP

IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PROGRAMMABLE MOVEMENT YOU'LL PROBABLY LIKE ROBORALLY LIKE I SAID THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T GET TO PLAY MINE MUCH AS NOT EVERYONE SEEMS TO LIKE IT
I'M A BOT BLEEP BLOOP SOMEONE HAS LINKED TO THIS THREAD FROM ANOTHER PLACE ON REDDIN

R ROBORALLY DISCUSSION ON THE VERSIONS OF ROBORALLY ON R BOARDGAMES

IF YOU FOLLOW ANY OF THE ABOVE LINKS PLEASE RESPECT THE RULES OF REDDIN AND DON'T VOTE IN THE OTHER THREADS INFO R TOTESMESSENGER CONTACT MESSAGE COMPOSE TO R TOTESMESSENGER


I THINK THIS GAME IS REALLY LONG FOR WHAT IT IS I'VE NOT TRIED THE NEW VERSION BUT IN THE OLD VERSION YOU'D GET A RUN AWAY LEADER ESPECIALLY IF THERE WAS A PLAYER WHO DOES PROGRAMMING FOR A LIVING

THE TIMER IS SUPER ESSENTIAL SOME PEOPLE TAKE FOR EVER MAKING THEIR MOVES THE CARDS IN THE OLD VERSION WERE MOSTLY USELESS THE POWER UP CARDS
A POSSIBLY UNPOPULAR STILL QUITE LENGTHY COUNTERPOINT INCOMING I DIDN'T ENJOY SECRET HITLER NEARLY AS MUCH AS OTHER SECRET ROLE GAMES AND I'VE BEEN ON WINNING AND LOSING TEAMS AND THAT'S BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAME WITH NO ACTUAL DEDUCTION

FOR ME IT'S ALL ABOUT THE RANDOM POLICY DECK WHICH ULTIMATELY DETERMINES WHO WINS FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T PLAYED BEFORE THE TABLE ELECTS TWO PEOPLE WHO THEN PULL THREE FASCIST OR LIBERAL POLICIES FROM A RANDOM PILE AND THEN CHOOSE FROM THOSE SINCE THE DECK IS RANDOM AND CONTAINS MORE BAD POLICIES THAN GOOD ONES IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT TWO GOOD PLAYERS MIGHT PULL THREE BAD POLICIES AND BE FORCED TO PASS A BAD ONE

OF COURSE THERE'S NO REASON FOR BAD GUYS TO EVER CLAIM ANYTHING OTHER THAN JUST BEING SCREWED BY THE DECK PASSING A GOOD GUY BAD TILES AND THEN LYING ABOUT WHAT THEY PULLED ONLY PUTS IMMEDIATE SUSPICION ON YOURSELF WHEREAS SIMPLY LYING ABOUT WHAT YOU GOT CAN BE SUSTAINED FOR ROUND AFTER ROUND UNTIL ENOUGH PEOPLE MAKE THE SAME CLAIM THAT THE TABLE GETS SUSPICIOUS OF EVERYONE

AND SINCE THE RESULTS ARE UNRELIABLE INFORMATION LITERALLY EVERYTHING YOU SEE FROM THE RESULTS OF AN ELECTION IS ALSO UNRELIABLE MECHANICALLY WHETHER A POLICY IS GOOD OR BAD MEANS NOTHING SINCE TWO GOOD PLAYERS COULD HAVE BEEN SCREWED AND TWO BAD PLAYERS COULD JUST LIE THERE'S NO CLEAR WAY TO TELL WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WITH POLICY TILES

WHAT THAT LEAVES THEN IS SIMPLE LYING THE BAD GUYS WILL LIE PREDICTABLY THAT THEY GOT SCREWED BY THE DECK AND THE GOOD GUYS WILL START ACCUSING EACH OTHER OF LYING BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO BASE THOSE ACCUSATIONS ON BESIDES A HUNCH AND IT LEADS TO THE LOUDEST PLAYERS DOMINATING THE CONVERSATION

WORST OF ALL THE HITLER WIN CONDITION IS EVEN MORE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT FROM A GOOD GUY PERSPECTIVE AND EVEN MORE BORING TO PLAY AS HITLER HIMSELF YOU WOULD THINK BEING THE SECRET BAD GUY WHO HAS TO GET THE OTHERS TO TRUST HIM HER WOULD BE A FUN ROLE TO PLAY BUT IT'S NOT THE OPTIMAL HITLER PLAY IS TO JUST BE A GOOD GUY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THERE'S NO STRATEGY TO IT YOU COULD TRY TO SAVE YOUR FASCIST FRIENDS IF THEY'RE BEING ACCUSED BUT IT DOES YOU NO GOOD AGAIN IT ONLY DRAWS SUSPICION TO YOU AND YOUR ROLE IS TO LAY LOW

EXAMPLE I HAD A GAME OF SECRET HITLER ONCE WHEN I WAS HITLER WE SPENT MINUTES DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT TO PUT ME ON A MISSION AND ALL I DID WAS SAY EH IF YOU WANT TO GREAT IF NOT THAT OTHER GUY IS A GOOD CHOICE I LISTENED QUIETLY AS MY FELLOW EVIL PEOPLE TALKED THE REST OF THE TABLE INTO ELECTING ME AND WHEN THE GAME ENDED THE BAD GUYS REJOICED AND THE GOOD GUYS CONGRATULATED ME FOR THE GREAT BLUFF BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING MY ROLE WAS ENTIRELY PASSIVE

BY BASICALLY BACKING OFF THE DISCUSSION I MADE IT FAR MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE GOOD GUYS TO SEE IF I WAS LYING OR NOT HAD I TALKED THEY COULD HAVE FIGURED OUT IF I WAS LYING BUT HOW YOU DO TEST SOMEONE WHEN THEY SHRUG AND SAY YOU DECIDE SURE YOU COULD GET SUSPICIOUS OF SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T TALK BUT WHEN THERE'S ALL THIS INFORMATION FLYING AROUND THE ROOM ABOUT GOOD AND BAD POLICIES AND WHO ELECTED WHOM THAT FADES TO THE BACKGROUND WHEN A BEST STRATEGY CAN BE REFUSE TO TALK THAT'S NOT SHARP DESIGN

I'VE PLAYED GAMES WHERE I GOT DEALT BAD CARDS AS A GOOD GUY AND WAS IGNORED FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR I'VE PLAYED GAMES WHERE THE BAD GUYS DREW ONLY GOOD TILES AND LOST I'VE PLAYED GAMES WHERE SOME PLAYERS AT THE TABLE NEVER EVEN TOUCHED A CARD I'VE PLAYED GAMES WHERE I'VE TURNED TO THE GUY NEXT TO ME WHO IS ALSO GOOD AND SAID I KNOW IT'S X AND Y BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO PROVE IT BECAUSE OF THE DECK

AT THE END OF THE DAY THE CORE MECHANIC OF SECRET HITLER JUST BECOMES CAN YOU TELL IF YOU FRIEND IS LYING WITH ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF OR THE RESISTANCE BLUFFING IS A PART OF THE GAME TOO BUT THERE'S ENOUGH SOLID INFORMATION IN THE GAME TO SUSS OUT WHO MIGHT BE TELLING THE TRUTH IN THE RESISTANCE YOU HAVE A BOARD THAT WILL GIVE YOU PERCENT ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO VOTED WHICH WAY WITH ONE NIGHT YOU HAVE THE SAME BLUFFING AS SECRET HITLER BUT IT'S BOILED DOWN TO A FIVE MINUTE GAME WHERE THE WAY CARDS INTERACT CAN GIVE YOU REAL INFORMATION OR AT THE VERY LEAST SET UP CONFLICTS BETWEEN TWO PLAYERS STORIES

FOR A GAME THAT'S TO MINUTES AND HAS ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT NO REAL BACKBONE SECRET HITLER IS JUST TOO LONG FOR AN ULTIMATELY SIMPLE MECHANIC IF YOU WANT A GREAT BLUFFING EXPERIENCE THAT'S EASY TO TEACH SKULL PLAYS TWICE AS QUICK IS TWICE AS SIMPLE NONE OF IT IS DUE TO LUCK AND IT TESTS PEOPLE'S LYING ABILITIES JUST AS MUCH

I DON'T HATE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS GAME YOU'RE ENTITLED TO LOVE IT THE COMPONENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS BUT I'VE SEEN A LOT OF HYPE SURROUNDING THIS GAME ESPECIALLY AT MY LOCAL GAME NIGHT I'VE SEEN PEOPLE EXPLAIN IT AS THE RESISTANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE TO LIE WHICH COULDN'T BE FURTHER FROM ACCURATE IN SOME WAYS I THINK NEWCOMERS MAY BE SETTING THEMSELVES UP FOR FRUSTRATION OR DISAPPOINTMENT IF THE LUCK OF THE POLICY DECK DOESN'T GO THEIR WAY JUST TEMPER YOUR EXPECTATIONS



PLAYED THIS WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS AND DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IT WORKS WELL WITH ALL AMOUNT BUT I LIKE HOW IT'S DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT

ALSO LIKE THAT YOU CAN FIND YOUR OWN STYLE THAT FITS WITH YOUR PERSONALITY OR NOT

MY BEST WIN WAS WHEN I WAS HITLER AND MY LIBERAL FRIEND WAS CONVINCED I WAS A LIBERAL AND WHEN HE MADE ME CHANCELLOR AND WE WON THE GAME HE WAS DISILLUSIONED FOR A MINUTE

NOTHING TO LOSE FRIENDSHIPS OVER THOUGH
I'VE PLAYED MAYBE A DOZEN GAMES AND I REALLY WANT TO LIKE IT THOSE PRODUCTION VALUES I HAVEN'T WRITTEN IT OFF YET BUT WE HAVE YET TO SEE THE FASCISTS WIN WE ARE A GROUP OF PLAYERS THAT HAVE PLAYED AVALON LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF TIME SO WE'RE VERY EXPERIENCED WITH SOCIAL DEDUCTION AND WE'RE ALSO MOSTLY ENGINEERS SO WE CAN SOLVE PUZZLES THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF GAMES WHERE IT'S BEEN CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR I'M NOT READY TO SAY WE'RE TOO GOOD TO LOSE BUT I'M MORE WILLING TO SAY THAT SOMETHING ABOUT OUR METAGRAM HEAVILY FAVORS LIBERALS EVEN IF I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS ANYONE ELSE HAVING THIS EXPERIENCE
IF ONLY ITD YOU KNOW SHOW UP AT MY HOUSE
MUST BE NICE TO HAVE THE GAME YET IM STILL WAITING FOR WAVE TWO
I PREFER THIS TO THE RESISTANCE IT'S EASIER TO TEACH AND SLIGHTLY MORE FORGIVING IN REGARDS TO LYING

I POWERED OUT OF A PLAYER GAME WHERE MY HITLER WAS IMMEDIATELY OUTED AS A FASCIST THAT JUST ISN'T POSSIBLE WITH THE RESISTANCE

IT'S IN MY TOP
SECRET HITLER IS A GREAT GAME BUT HAS A COUPLE OF FATAL FLAWS THERE ISN'T A LOT OF CONCRETE INFORMATION SO THE GAME DEVOLVES INTO POINTLESS ARGUING THAT DRAGS THINGS OUT TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE YOU CAN GET ELIMINATED AND HAVE TO WAIT MINUTES FOR THE GAME TO END FINALLY THE GAME IS IMBALANCE AS THE LIBERALS CAN STEAMROLL THE GAME BY GETTING LUCKY WITH A GOOD TEAM EARLY GAME


I'M PART OF AN PERSON NEETUP AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE TABLES OF RESISTANCE AVALON EVERY NIGHT BUT NO SECRET HITLER
MY WIFE ALMOST DIVORCED ME BECAUSE OF THIS GAME BECAUSE OF HOW WELL I WAS ABLE TO LIE TO HER TO CONVINCE HER I WASNT HITLER AND SHE MADE ME CHANCELLOR AND THE FASCISTS WON

NOT REALLY
YOU CAN EASILY PLAY THIS WITH A PACK OF CARDS RED FOR LIBERAL YES VOTES FACE CARDS FOR ROLES I FEEL IT'S BEST WITH PLAYERS PERSONALLY
OUR GROUP OF MASTERS STUDENTS HAS PLAYED A HORRIFYING AMOUNT OF SECRET HITLER ACROSS SEVERAL FIELD EXCURSIONS AND IT IS EASILY THE FAVOURITE WITH CODENAMES A CLOSE SECOND MAYBE WE'RE JUST TERRIBLE PEOPLE
I ALSO LIKE IT A LOT IT HAS ALMOST THE PERFECT BALANCE BETWEEN INFORMATION YOU GET FROM GAMEPLAY AND PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN LIE ITS NOT LIKE YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION PURELY ON WHO YOU THINK TELLS THE TRUTH OR IS MORE CONVINCING
IT IS ONLY NOW AFTER READING YOUR POST THAT I REALIZED I NEVER GOT MY COPY LOOKS LIKE I FORGOT TO CONFIRM THE ORDER DETAILS WHEN THEY SENT THE FOLLOW-UP EMAIL

I HOPE I CAN STILL GET IT
WISH I COULD ACTUALLY BUY THIS GAME
HAVEN'T PLAYED A TON OF SECRET HITLER I HAVE THE POD VERSION SO I CAN'T QUITE TELL WHETHER I LIKE IT MORE OR LESS THAN THE RESISTANCE AVALON I DON'T THINK I HAVE A HUGE PREFERENCE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I WOULD PROBABLY SAY HAVING BOTH AROUND CAN BE NICE FOR VARIETY'S SAKE THEMATICALLY IT'S FUN TO BE ABLE TO ACCUSE PEOPLE OF BEING LITERALLY HITLER IN SECRET HITLER TOO
A COLON IN YOUR TITLE WOULD SURE MAKE THINGS A LOT LESS COMFORTABLE
MY GROUP JUST PLAYED THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY AFTERNOON IT WAS REALLY WELL RECEIVED WE HAVE DONE AVALON AND ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF SO THERE HAD BEEN SOME SECRET ROLE FAMILIARITY IN OUR GROUP BUT THIS GAME WAS MORE WELL RECEIVED BY EVERYONE AT THE TABLE THAN THE OTHER GAMES IT ALSO SEEMED TO MOVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY TWO THUMBS UP AFTER ONE PLAY THROUGH
I PLAYED THIS THE WEEKEND BEFORE THANKSGIVING FOR THE FIRST TIME TWICE I PLAYED WITH THE FULL PEOPLE AND THREE TIMES WITH A GROUP OF GOOD FUN AT BOTH GROUP SIZES THE FASCISTS ONLY WON ONCE THEY MANAGED TO GET THE ASSASSINATE POWER BOTH TIMES LEAVING THE LIBERALS OUTNUMBERED FOR THE LAST ROUND OR TWO THE LIBERALS WON ONCE BY GETTING LUCKY WITH THE FIRST ASSASSINATE AND KILLING HITLER THE REST OF THE GAMES THE LIBERALS WON BY PASSING ENOUGH POLICIES TWICE IT WAS PRETTY LOPSIDED ONLY THREE OR FOUR FASCIST ONES PASSED BUT ONCE BOTH TEAMS WERE WITHIN ON POLICY OF WINNING THERE WAS A FASCIST CHANCELLOR AND THE PRESIDENT PULLED BOTH REMAINING LIBERAL POLICIES FROM THE DECK

THERE'S JUST ENOUGH STRATEGY TO IT TO MAKE IT PRETTY INTERESTING WHILE BEING JUST LIGHT ENOUGH TO ENJOY THIS WHILE TIPSY WITHOUT SCREWING THINGS UP FOR YOUR TEAMMATES IT'LL SEE A LOT OF PLAY FROM MY GROUPS IN THE FUTURE
I ENJOYED THIS QUITE A BIT BUT THE GAME IN MY GROUP AT LEAST HEAVILY FAVORED LIBERALS UNLESS FASCISTS WERE VERY SLY WITH THEIR WORDS IT WAS A RUNAWAY VICTORY FOR LIBERALS AND THE PEOPLE WHO TALKED THE MOST WERE ALMOST ALWAYS FASCISTS
ANOTHER THING DOWNLOAD THE APP IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS IT ALLEVIATES ALL PLAYERS FROM THE TASK OF MODERATOR SO THEY CAN JUST CONCENTRATE ON THEIR ROLE IT ALSO SETS THE TONE A BIT
WHERE CAN I GET THIS GAME ANYONE KNOW THE COST OR RELEASE
WE PLAYED A LOT OF AVALON BEFORE THIS AND WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT SECRET HITLER BUT IT FELL FLAT FOR US IMO THERE ARE TOO MANY FASCIST CARDS IN THE DECK THE GAME IS ABOUT DEDUCTION BUT YOU KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SOMEONE LIKELY DID PULL FASCIST CARDS ONCE OR EVEN TWICE IN THE GAME MAYBE WE MISSED SOMETHING BUT AS A GAMING GROUP WHO LIKE SKILL THIS KILLED IT FOR US
I LOVE THIS GAME SIMPLE TO LEARN EASY TO PLAY
WE PLAYED THREE GAMES RECENTLY AT A GAME NIGHT TWO WITH PEOPLE ONE WITH

OUR FIRST GAME EVER ENDED UP BEING A RUNAWAY FASCIST WIN VIA SIX POLICIES I THINK THIS WAS MOSTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE STILL FIGURING OUT THE STRATEGY AS I BELIEVE HARDLY ANYONE VOTED AGAINST ANY CHANCELLOR NOMINEES
OUR SECOND GAME WAS AGAIN WON BY THE FASCISTS AS THE SECRET HITLER WHOM WAS ACTUALLY THE SAME HITLER AS THE FIRST GAME DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF ACTING LIBERAL HE ACTUALLY GOT NOMINATED BY A LIBERAL PRESIDENT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE THIRD FASCIST POLICY HAD BEEN ENACTED
OUR THIRD GAME WAS WON BY THE LIBERALS THIS GAME WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACK DOWN THE FASCISTS HOWEVER THE LIBERALS KNEW OF TWO PROBABLE FASCISTS ONE OF WHICH WAS HITLER WHO WAS KILLED WITH THE FIRST ASSASSINATION

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE MECHANIC THAT YOU NEED TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL ABOUT CHANCELLOR ELECTIONS AFTER THE THIRD FASCIST POLICY IT DEFINITELY AMPS UP THE DISCUSSIONS RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO START JUDGING WHO IS FASCIST

OVERALL MOST PEOPLE LOVED THE GAME AND WERE EXCITED TO START A NEW ROUND AFTER THE PRIOR ONE FINISHED IT SEEMS PRETTY WELL BALANCED BUT YOU DEFINITELY NEED PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO TALK AND QUESTION DECISIONS IN ORDER FOR YOUR TEAM TO WIN I THINK IT'S MORE APPROACHABLE THAN SIMILAR GAMES IN THE GENRE BOTH BECAUSE LYING IN THIS PARTICULAR GAME SEEMS EASIER NOT SURE WHY BUT ALSO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE THEME I EXPECT IT TO BE A POPULAR PARTY GAME IN OUR HOUSE FOR A LONG TIME
THIS IS ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO ME ALTHOUGH I FINALLY GOT TO PLAY WITH A GROUP A FEW WEEKS PRIOR MY POOR WIFE KNEW THAT I WAS READY TO JUMP ON THE FIRST GROUP OF FIVE THAT CAME OVER WE FINALLY HAD WILLING BUT SKEPTICAL OPPONENTS ON THANKSGIVING AND IT WAS AN ENORMOUS HIT THEY WANTED TO KEEP PLAYING MY WIFE IS OR A GAMER BUT THE NEXT MORNING OUT OF NOWHERE SHE SAID I WISH YOU DIDN'T NEED FIVE TO PLAY SECRET HITLER
I LOVE THAT THESE GUYS SIMPLY DECIDED TO PRETEND THAT ROBERT ANTON WILSON AND ILLUMINATI DIDN'T EXIST
ONE GAME THAT LOOKS INTERESTING IS CRYPTIC EXPLORERS IT'S A VS MANY ASYMMETRIC DUNGEON CRAWL THAT APPEARS TO OFFER A LOT MORE VARIABILITY THAN MOST OF THE DUNGEON CRAWLERS ON THE SHELVES TODAY IT'S GOT SOME REALLY AWESOME ART AND A CONCEPT THAT'S COMMON ON THE SURFACE BUT UNIQUE IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF THEM BASICALLY SOME OLD GOD WITH SOME UNIQUE POWERS BENT ON DESTROYING SOME PEOPLE

THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS THAT THE CAMPAIGN ISN'T DOING TOO WELL THEY STACKED UP WITH SOME HEAVY HITTERS KD M AND SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE FORBIDDEN CITY THEY AREN'T IN ON THE MINIATURE GAME WHICH ISN'T IN ITSELF A NEGATIVE BUT IT ALIENATES A LARGE PORTION OF THE KICKSTARTER BOARDGAME FUNDING CROWD WHO DO IT FOR THE SWEET MINIS AND THEY'RE MISSING REVIEWS FROM SOME BIGGER NAMES THEY'RE A VERY SMALL COMPANY WITH LITTLE TO NO PUSHING POWER AND THEIR INEXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY PUSHES SOME AWAY ANY OF THESE THINGS WOULDN'T BE TERRIBLE BUT I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THEM REALLY SLOWED THEIR PROGRESS TO THE CRAWL WHICH ENDS IN THEIR UNSUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN


IT'S TOO BAD I REALLY LIKED THE IDEA OF THE HIGHLY VARIABLE PARTY AND GODS AS WELL AS THE ARTICLE
LOOKS LIKE THEY NEED TO GET TO ADVERTISING SOMETIMES JUST BAIGN ON KICKSTARTER ISN'T ENOUGH AND YOU HAVE TO DO SOME HEAVY FACEBOOK TWITTER REDDIN TUMBLR CAMPAIGNING I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN REMEMBER SEEING THIS GAME AND I HIT KICKSTARTER EVERY FEW DAYS AND SORT BY NEWEST START FOR TABLETOP GAMES THAT BEING SAID I DON'T ACTUALLY CLICK ON EACH ONE AS I VERY MUCH JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER AND IF IT DOESN'T SCREAM OUT TO ME WHEN I'M BROWSING IT DOESN'T GET MY ATTENTION
THE RULEBOOK FOR THIS GAVE ME CANCER IT SUCKED SO HARD I HOPE NO ONE GIVES THEM MONEY TO ENCOURAGE SUCH SHITTY WORK
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT WRONG WITH THAT GAME IS AN INSANE PRICE FOR A CARD GAME ALSO THEIR FUNDING GOAL IS THAT'S DOUBLE WHAT STONEMAIER GAMES NEEDED FOR SCYTHE S FUNDING GOAL

LISBOA ON KS NOW HAD A LOWER FUNDING GOAL TOO THIS IS RIDICULOUS
I DON'T THINK THE ART STYLE IS HELPING THINGS EITHER

PEOPLE REALLY HATE MUNCHKIN AND ART LIKE THAT LEGITIMATELY GIVES THEM PTSD
ASCENSION IS AN ENJOYABLE DECKBUILDER AND IT'S GOT ABOUT DIFFERENT EXPANSIONS
ASCENSION THE FACT THAT THE ROW OF CARDS AVAILABLE TO ACQUIRE CHANGES CONSTANTLY MEANS THAT GAMES CAN PLAY OUT VERY DIFFERENTLY EVEN WITH JUST ONE SET AND SINCE THERE ARE SETS ALL OF WHICH CAN BE PLAYED SEPARATELY OR COMBINED IN DIFFERENT WAYS YOU GET A LOT OF DIFFERENT INTERACTIONS AVAILABLE
I'D RECOMMEND GETTING A FEW CHEAPER DECK BUILDERS WHICH HAVE ALSO PROVED TO BE MY FAVORITES IN THE GENRE

STAR REALMS

PAPERBACK

THE VALLEY OF KINGS
IN TERMS OF BANG FOR BUCK STAR REALMS HAS THE MOST PLAYS BY FAR OF ANY DECKBUILDER I OWN AND I OWN A LOT OF EM I'M NOT EVEN COUNTING APP PLAYS XD
I WOULD PROBABLY SAY EITHER LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN OR TYRANTS OF THE UNDERMARK

I'M LEANING MORE TOWARDS TYRANTS BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE A BOARD THAT YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AS WELL AS THE CARDS WHICH MAKES YOU TRY TO BALANCE THE TWO THINGS TO CAPITALIZE ON POINTS
I'D RECOMMEND TRAINS AND TYRANTS FROM THE UNDERMARK AS THEY BOTH FEATURE A BOARD TO WORK AROUND AND MIX THINGS UP MORE TYRANTS IS A LONGER GAME AND IT HAS THE ROTATING MARKET WHERE YOU HAVE TO PLAY EVEN MORE TACTICALLY TRAINS HAS THE FIXED MARKET AND PLAYS A BIT QUICKER BOTH ARE SOLID DECK BUILDERS WITH DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO EXPLORE AND PLENTY OF CARD VARIETY
ANOTHER VOTE FOR THE ASCENSION SERIES HERE
JUST SINCE IT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED I'LL TOSS IN THUNDERSTONE ADVANCE OR THUNDERSTONE NUMENERA
I FEEL LIKE SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE MAY BE THE ANSWER HERE CONSIDERING THERE ARE MISSIONS THAT COME WITH THE GAME THAT REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE LOGGED AT LEAST GAMES AMONG YOUR GROUP THE EXPANSION DOES HELP TO GIVE A BIT MORE MISSION VARIETY FOR LOWER LEVEL PLAYERS
LEGENDARY MARVEL DARK CITY EXPANSION
MAGE KNIGHT
LEWIS CLARK
CONCORDIA

WHAT SPECIFICALLY DID YOU DISLIKE ABOUT IT
I DON'T OWN IT BUT I PLAYED WITH A MATE WHO HAS IT I ENJOYED THE FIRST MINS OR SO BUT I FOUND THE STORIES A LITTLE LONG AND BY THE END OF EACH ONE I WAS OVER IT I ONLY PLAYED THREE STORIES THOUGH SO NOT SURE IF THEY GET BETTER AS IT GOES ON
IT FELL FLAT WITH US TOO MISSIONS BEEN SPLIT IN SMALLER BITS
WE ALSO FORGOT OR NEVER CARED TO SPEND TIME TO SEARCH FOR ITEMS THOUGH THEY PROBABLY MADE THE GAMEPLAY RICHER
THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE TOO I GOT 2 FULL-HEARTED ATTEMPTS IN AND IT JUST DIDN'T WORK FOR THE GROUP I GOT HOOKED WHEN I SAW WIL WHEATON PLAY THE GAME WITH HIS FAMILY ON TABLETOP AND SAW SO MANY PEOPLE SAYING IT'S AN ELEGANTLY SIMPLE RPG FOR EVERYONE

TURNS OUT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY COMPLICATED RPG THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF AND SOME DOWNTIME AS YOU COME ACROSS SPECIAL ENCOUNTERS IT'S DEFINITELY A GAME I WOULD PLAY A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH AN EXPERIENCED GROUP BEFORE DIVING INTO
I AGREE DIDN'T GO OVER WELL WITH ME OR MY NIECES PLAYED ONCE SOLD IT
IT'S AN EXTREMELY LIGHT GAME WHERE THE DICE ROLLS HEAVILY WEIGH ON WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH IF YOU'RE NOT IN IT PURELY FOR THE STORY IT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER
I PLAYED THIS ONE AT A CONVENTION A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT DIDN'T EXCITE ME EITHER YOU'RE NOT ALONE FELT TOO LONG RELIED TOO MUCH ON DICE ROLLS AND HAD TOO MANY FIDDLY BITS FOR MY LIKING CUTE THEME THOUGH
SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME THOUGHT I WOULD LOVE IT TURNED OUT TO BE A REAL BORING SLOG
A GAME WITH A GREAT AESTHETIC BUT CLUNKY DESIGN WE TRIED RUNEBOUND AND LEGENDS OF ANDOR AFTER BEING DISAPPOINTED IN MICE AND MYSTICS AND FOUND THEM BOTH TO BE MUCH MUCH BETTER
MAM IS MORE OF A STORYTELLING FOR YOUNG ONES THAN A FULL GROWN DUNGEON CRAWLER IF YOU EXPECTED A NEW DESCENT OR IND I COULD UNDERSTAND ANY DISAPPOINTMENT I BOUGHT IT AS A LIGHT DUNGEONCRAWLER TO PLAY WITH MY EPHES AND WE HAD A BLAST

THE GAME IS ACTUALLY REALLY NICE JUST A LITLE EASY STILL I LIKE AND ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS
THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU WILL BE AS DISAPPOINTED IF NOT MORE AFTER PLAYING MORE YOU WOULD EXPECT TO FIND MORE INTERESTING EVENTS MECHANICS BUT THE FOLLOWING SCENARIOS HARDLY OFFER ANYTHING NEW FOR ME THE MOST DISAPPOINTING THING WAS THAT EVERYTHING IN THE GAME IS SOLVED BY ROLLING DICE AND YOU JUST KEEP FOLLOWING WHAT HAPPENS ALMOST IF IT WAS AN AUTOMATED STORY DISGUISED AS A BOARD GAME THE CHARACTER PROGRESSION ISN'T VERY INTERESTING AND AT LEAST I FELT THE STORY WAS A BIT TOO CHILDISH TO DRAW ME IN

M M WORKS FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T INTO HEAVIER GAMES OR ARE NEW TO HOBBY BOARD GAMES IF YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE OF MORE COMPLEX GAMES OR HEAVIER DUNGEON CRAWLERS ADVENTURE GAMES YOU'LL BE ALMOST GUARANTEED TO GET DISAPPOINTED WITH M MASCULINE

THERE'S ALSO A CHANCE THAT YOU JUST HAD TOO HIGH EXPECTATION FOR THE GAME AND WILL ENJOY IT MORE NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW IT PLAYS
I DONT KNOW IF THIS HELPS YOU OR ANYONE BUT HERE IT IS BEING PLAYED BY WIL WHEATON AND HIS FAMILY ON TABLETOP

WATCH V
ARE THE CHAPTERS REPAYABLE OR IS IT SIMILAR TO ANDOR
WELL IF YOU WANT TO GET RID OF IT PM ME
SORRY IT DIDNT WORK OUT FOR YOUR GROUP A FEW COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT IS YOU ARE ROLLING A TON FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING IF YOU DO NOT ENJOY THA BEING THE MAIN ACTION THEN YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS GAME

MAYBE CHECK OUT R BOARDGAMEEXCHANGE
MICE MYSTICS IS BEST PLAYED WITH GAMERS FRESH INTO THE HOBBY THAT LIKE SIMPLICITY BUT WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF THEME MY ONLY NEGATIVE ABOUT THE GAME IS THE RULES THERE ARE QUITE A FEW FIDDLY RULES THAT ARE MIXED BETWEEN THE CAMPAIGN BOOK AND THE RULEBOOK THIS CAUSES DOWNTIME IN BETWEEN THE GAME AND PEOPLE HATE DOWNTIME ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS A DICE CHUCKER I THINK IT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP UNTIL MY KID IS OF AGE TO PLAY BUT I LIKELY WONT WHIP IT OUT FOR ANOTHER GAME NIGHT WITH FRIENDS
THE RULES GET MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AS TIME GOES ON

BUT IF IT FELL FLAT ON THE FIRST CHAPTER HONESTLY IT'S UNLIKELY TO GET BETTER MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS GAME WE JUST BOUGHT THE EXPANSION BUT IT'S VERY LIGHT FOR MY SO AND I SO WE LEAN HEAVILY ON THE ROLE-PLAYING ASPECT

YOU HAVE IT SO MIGHT AS WELL TRY A FEW CHAPTERS MAYBE ROLE-PLAYING WILL FILL THAT GAP FOR YOU
ARE YOU A SINGLE DIGIT IN AGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO BE

THIS GAME IS FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN
MAYBE DUNGEONS DRAGONS THE FANTASY ADVENTURE BOARDGAME
I WANT TO SAY HEROQUEST EXCEPT FOR THE RED DOTS HOW LONG AGO WAS THIS
DESCENT MAYBE
I SAW SOMEBODY ELSE POST RECENTLY ABOUT PICKING UP BLACK FLEET FOR AT THEIR FAGS THIS COULD BE A THING
A FAGS NEAR ME MEEPLEMART IN TORONTO SAID THEY WERE TAKING PART WHEN THEY RECEIVED STOCK BUT HAVEN'T UPDATED SINCE ABOUT IT TAKING PLACE
LEAVING EARTH IS AMAZING AND SOLVING THE PUZZLES ARE ONLY HALF THE GAME IF YOU'RE PLAYING WITH OTHER PEOPLE IT BECOMES A TENSE SPACE RACE WITH LOTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT WITH TWO AND A CRAZY NEGOTIATION GAME WITH OR
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AN ASTRONAUT TRYING TO FIND A BOARD GAME LOL
AGRICOLA AND CAVERN ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR KEY DIFFERENCES ARE

IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO GET FOOD IN AGRICOLA SO YOU HAVE TO SPEND MORE TIME SETTING UP A FOOD ENGINE RATHER THAN A VICTORY POINT ENGINE IN THAT GAME
AGRICOLA USES A HAND OF OCCUPATION AND MINOR IMPROVEMENT CARDS TO GUIDE YOUR STRATEGY RATHER THAN A SET OF ROOMS OPEN TO EVERYONE TO BUILD BUT WITHOUT ALTERING THE RULES THE LUCK OF THE DRAW CAN SIGNIFICANTLY BIAS A GAME TOWARDS A PLAYER
AGRICOLA HAS AN EXPANSION THAT ADDS MORE DIFFICULTY BY MAKING YOU ALSO CONSIDER HEATING YOUR HOME

OVERALL I'D SAY IF YOU DON'T LIKE CAVERN YOU SHOULD TRY BEFORE YOU BUY AGRICOLA IT MIGHT NOT BE PUNCHING ENOUGH FOR YOU



LEAVING EARTH IS A LOGISTICS GAME ITS ALL ABOUT MISSION PLANNING WHICH MEANS ITS ALL ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW MUCH THRUST YOU NEED TO GET SOMEWHERE AS YOU SHED MASS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE CARDS FOR VP WHAT MAKES IT TIGHT IS THE FIXED YEAR BUDGET THAT IS USE IT OR LOSE IT JUST LIKE IN THE REAL WORLD SINCE YOU USE A SUBSET OF VP CARDS FOR THE GAME THERE IS NO GET THE IDEAL SOLUTION TO USE EVERY GAME STRATEGY AND IF THERE WERE SUCH AN IDEAL SOLUTION THEN THE GAME WOULD BE DETERMINED BY TURN ORDER THERE ARE ALSO A FEW OTHER RANDOM CARDS RADIATION EFFECTS PLANETARY MOON SURFACES AND EACH TECHNOLOGY GETS OR CARDS ON IT FROM A DECK OF MAJOR FAILURE MINOR FAILURES AND SUCCESSES WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF RANDOMNESS OPTIONS THESE WILL ALSO PREVENT A UNIVERSAL OPTIMUM ROCKET BUILDING

HOWEVER IT IS A VERY DETERMINISTIC AND NOT RANDOM AT ALL UNLIKE HIGH FRONTIER AND IT ALSO COVERS A HISTORICAL PERIOD RATHER THAN A HYPOTHETICAL FUTURE AGAIN UNLIKE HIGH FRONTIER IS IT PUNISHING YES AND NUMBER IS IT SOLVABLE NOT REALLY HOWEVER ITS NATURE MAKES IT NOT A GAME FOR EVERYONE

DO YOU PLAY TRAIN GAMES ONE OF THOSE MIGHT BE UP YOUR ALLY STOCK MARKET TYPE GAMEPLAY THAT CAN BE QUITE PUNISHING ITS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN MEANING TO GET INTO BUT HAVEN'T PAID FOR YET BECAUSE THE GAMES TEND TO HAVE SMALLER PRINT RUNS AND THUS HIGHER PRICES IT ISN'T SF BUT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT MATCHES YOUR TASTES BUT AGAIN TRY BEFORE YOU BUY AND AS ALWAYS YOU COULD SUBSTITUTE YOUTUBE PLAY THROUGH VIDEOS FOR ACTUAL PLAY IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE GAME
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS I'M SURE IT'LL BE OF BENEFIT TO MANY PEOPLE

I WATCHED AN OVERVIEW NOT THIS VIDEO AND THEN JUST SET IT UP AND PLAYED

DO NOT TRY AND READ THE RULEBOOK FROM FRONT TO BACK WITHOUT THE PIECES SETUP YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT
YOU ARE AMAZING I CANT GET THROUGH THE RULEBOOK WITHOUT CRYING
THANK YOU HAVEN'T OPENED UP MY COPY FROM ESSEN YET

SOME PICS FROM OTHER USERS LAST TIME THIS QUESTION WAS POSTED HETP
PERSONALLY I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY OF THE BAGS DESIGNED FOR CARRYING LAPTOPS THEY TEND TO BE SQUARER IN SHAPE SO SHOULDN'T PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON SQUARE BOXES INSIDE PLUS THEY ARE OFTEN PADDED AT THE BASE WHICH HELPS PROTECT THEM PRETTY WELL
I USE THE KR KAISER 2 FOR ALL MY GAMING

FITS 2 OF THEIR PLUCK FOAM CARD CASES OR 2 IKEA AMLA STORAGE CRATES MAGNETISED TO CARRY ANYTHING OR LARGE BOX GAMES SEVERAL SMALL BOX GAMES

HAS A TON OF ZIP VELCRO POCKETS FOR BOOKS DICE ETC


IF I WAS DRIVING AND WANTED TO CARRY A TON OF BOXED GAMES I'D JUST CHUCK THEM INTO A CAJON BAG OR A BIG CANVAS TOOLBAG
THE TWO GAMES ARE VERY DIFFERENT MECHANICALLY COI IS A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT DOUBLE DECK BUILDER ETV IS MORE A LITE GAME WITH SOME QUIRKY TERRITORY CONTROL OWNING BOTH COI GETS TO THE TABLE MORE BUT THAT'S JUST MY GROUP COI 1ST EDITION IS JUST FINE AND THE EXPANSION ADDS SOME FUN
STUFF WHILE THE 2ND END IS PRETTIER BUT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THOSE EXPANSION OPTIONS YET
CAN YOU EVEN FIND ETV FOR PURCHASE I THOUGHT IT WAS LONG OUT OF PRINTING
I THOUGHT THE SAME THAT THEY MIGHT BE TOO SIMILAR BUT HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR HAS A VERY DIFFERENT VIBE FROM FRIDAY

THE PACING FOR ONE IS A LOT MORE EVEN IN FRIDAY BUILDING UP THE IDEAL DECK AND GETTING A SENSE OF HOW YOU DO THAT BEST IS FAIRLY UNIFORM FROM GAME TO GAME THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE DECK WILL ALWAYS BE FRIENDLY BUT THE ALGORITHM DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH FOR HOW YOU ACHIEVE A GOOD END SCORE

IN HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR THE DICE ROLLS AND TERROR CARDS DRAWN AFTER THE ROLLING PORTION OF EACH ROUND CAN PRODUCE SOME PRETTY DRAMATIC SWINGS THROUGHOUT THE GAME ADD THIS TO THE DIFFERENT HOSTAGE TAKER SCENARIOS AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT YOU'LL FACE A BROADER SPECTRUM OF TACTICAL OPTIONS THAN ARE AVAILABLE IN FRIDAY

I'VE ENJOYED BOTH BUT DEFINITELY NOTICE MORE OF AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY AND VOLATILITY IN HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR WHICH I GUESS FITS VERY WELL WITH THE THEME
I LOVE FRIDAY BUT FOUND HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR TO BE REALLY BORING THEY'RE REALLY VERY DIFFERENT STYLES OF GAME GRANTED THEY BOTH HAVE A LOT OF CHANCE BUT HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR FELT TOO CHAOTIC TO ME

AS ANOTHER COMMENTER SAID SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL IS A GOOD GAME THOUGH THE THEME IS VERY DARK
I LOVE FRIDAY IT'S NOT MY SOLO GAME THAT HONOUR GOES TO COFFEE ROASTER BUT THAT CAN BE HARD TO FIND

TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I FIND HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR IS NOTHING LIKE FRIDAY AND I FIND IT IS JUST OK VERY DIFFICULT TO WIN IT'S ALRIGHT BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS FRIDAY

I LIKE SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL BUT IT'S HARD NOT UNWINNABLE THOUGH I STILL PREFER FRIDAY AND MANY OTHER GAMES FOR MY SOLO FIX

NOW FOR GAMES BETTER THAN HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR IN MY OPINION WHICH ALSO PLAY SOLO

YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT THE UNIVERSE GAMES KNIERIM SYLVIAN CASTELLATION NAUTILICONE AND EVENTUALLY URBIAN WILL BE REPRINTED NAUTILICONE IS THE LATEST RELEASES IN ABOUT A WEEK AND SEEMS LIKE IT WILL GET THE MOST PLAY OUT OF THE LOT BASED ON VIDEOS I'VE SEEN BUT I LIKE ALL OF THEM EXCEPT URBIAN AS I MISSED THE FIRST PRINTING THEY ALL CAN PLAY CO-OP FOR 2 PLAYERS AS WELL AS PRIMARILY SOLO

THERE ARE MORE TRADITIONAL THAT CAN BE PLAYED SOLO WHICH MIGHT BE WORTH YOUR LOOK SUCH AS ASCENSION AND ATTACK ON TITAN

THE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THE CARD GAME IS A TINY BOX PLAYS GREAT SOLO AND CAN GO UP TO PLAYERS IF YOU HAVE A LARGE ENOUGH TABLE TO SPLAY ALL THE NECESSARY CARDS OUT

COSMIC RUN IS A COOL LITTLE GAME THAT CAN PLAY SOLO OR COMPETITIVE OR CO-OP WORTH A LOOK


MULTIUNIVERSUM CAN PLAY PLAYERS AND IT'S AN ELEGANT SYSTEM I'VE NOT SEEN BEFORE YOU SEAL PORTALS AND MOVE YOUR STEEPLE AROUND TO DIFFERENT STATIONS PLAY CARDS TO DO ACTIONS I LIKE IT A TON THERE'S A CTHULHU EXPANSION COMING OUT THAT SEEMS LIKE IT ADDS SOME NICE ELEMENTS TOO THE SAME DEVELOPER MADE THE GAME AGENT DECKER WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE PUBLISHED SOON BUT THE IS AVAILABLE AND WORTH CHECKING OUT

VITICULTURE NEW BEDFORD AND AGRICOLA ARE ALL WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES THAT CAN BE PLAYED SOLO AND WORK GREAT WITH 2 PLAYERS AS WELL THOUGH THEY DO GO HIGHER THAN THAT

PANDEMIC THE CURE IS FAIRLY QUICK AND FUN LOTS OF DICE TO ROLL IT'S A CO-OP GAME FOR PLAYERS I BELIEVE BUT IT'S VERY EASY TO PLAY IT SOLO TOO

ANY OF THESE GAMES I'VE MENTIONED I WILL PULL OUT BEFORE TAKING HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR OFF THE SHELF SO I KINDA THINK TO ANSWER YOUR SECOND QUESTION IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD MOVE TO BUY IT BUT THAT MIGHT JUST BE ME I WANT TO ENJOY IT MORE I JUST DON'T MAYBE BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY OTHER BETTER GAMES
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLAY STYLES AND THEME I HAVE BOTH AND HAVE NEVER FELT THEY OVERLAPPED BUY WITH CONFIDENCE
I HAVEN'T PLAYED HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR BUT YOU MIGHT LIKE SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL WHICH HAS A LOT OF THE SAME TENSION AS FRIDAY BUT WITH A REALLY DIFFERENT FEEL AND THEME IT ALSO SUPPORTS PLAYERS
THESE ARE THE ONES THAT MY WIFE AND I LOVE TO PLAY AS 2 PLAYER GAMES

VITICULTURE ESSENTIAL EDITION IS OUR FAVORITE WORKER PLACEMENT GAME SO FAR

BEYOND BAKER STREET IS LIKE HANAFI WITH THEME I'VE HEARD HANAFI DOESN'T PLAY VERY WELL WITH 2 PLAYERS AND I LIKE THEME IN MY GAMES SO I SKIPPED STRAIGHT TO BAKER STREET WE LIKE IT A LOT AS WE NEED TO CO-OPERATE AND IT ISN'T LIKE ANY OTHER GAMES WELL EXCEPT HANAFI LOL

LEGACY THE TESTAMENT OF DUKE DE CRECY IS A GREAT LITTLE GAME WHERE YOU'RE KINDA DOING WORKER PLACEMENT BUT MOSTLY FOCUSING ON BUILDING OUT YOUR FAMILY TREE IT'S COOL THOUGH IT USES A LOT OF TABLE SPACE OUR TABLE IS SMALLISH

EMPIRE LEGENDS IF YOU WANT A LIGHTER KIND OF WAR AREA CONTROL IT DOESN'T LAST AN HOUR BUT YOU WILL PROBABLY WANT TO PLAY IT MORE THAN ONCE BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY GOOD

PATCHWORK IS A GREAT LITTLE GAME THAT HAS THE TERRIS TOUCH I REPLACED THE CARDBOARD BUTTONS WITH REAL ONES FOR A MORE THEMATIC EXPERIENCE I'D LIKE TO REPLACE ALL THE TILES WITH FABRIC BUT I LACK THE SKILL TO DO THAT

JAIPUR IS A MARKETPLACE GAME IT'S QUICK AND EASY TO LEARN AND IT'S VERY AND ALMOST ALWAYS RECOMMENDED AND FOR GOOD REASON

THE NETWORKS IS A COOL GAME ABOUT RUNNING YOUR OWN TV STATIONS YOU HIRE STARS RUN ADS AND RUN SHOWS WE DIG IT

THE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THE CARD GAME USES A LOT OF TABLE SPACE BUT IT'S PRETTY GREAT

THE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY USES LESS TABLE SPACE THAN THE CARD GAME VERSION BUT ALSO TAKES LONGER TO PLAY NOT THAT BIG A DEAL BECAUSE WE LOVE IT TOO

ASCENSION DREAMSCAPE OR REALLY ALMOST ANY OF THE ASCENSION SETS IT'S A GAME WITH A FANTASY THEME IF YOU PREFER A SCI-FI VERSION THERE'S STAR REALMS WHICH IS FAIRLY SIMILAR

COSMIC RUN IS A RACE TO EXPLORE PLANETS IT'S PRETTY GOOD THE SAME GUY MADE BIBLIOG AND CAPO DEI API BOTH OF WHICH I OWN AND THE WIFE AND I ENJOY PLAYING ALL THREE

MOUSE GUARD SWORDS AND STRONGHOLDS REPLACES CHESS FOR US WELL FOR ME MY WIFE HASN'T PLAYED CHESS IT'S SIMPLER MUCH SIMPLER AND SHORTER BUT IT'S FUN AND SHE WINS MORE THAN I DO AND IT HAS CUTE LITTLE PLASTIC MICE PAWNS

LOTUS IF YOU WANT SET COLLECTION WITH A TOUCH OF AREA CONTROL BEAUTIFUL CARDS THAT SPLAY OUT AS FLOWERS

PANDEMIC THE CURE WE DON'T CARE MUCH FOR THE ORIGINAL PANDEMIC BUT WE LIKE CHUCKING DICE IN THIS FASTER SIMPLER VERSION LOTS OF DICE WE DIG IT

ATTACK ON TITAN THE GAME I DON'T HAVE THIS YET BUT IT LOOKS FUN FROM THE VIDEOS I'VE WATCHED I SOLD MY COPY OF LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET IT TO THE TABLE VERY OFTEN AND THIS IS WHAT I HOPE WILL REPLACE IT I'LL ALSO BE PLAYING IT SOLO

BLACK ORCHESTRA MY COPY SHOULD ARRIVE THIS WEEK I HOPE YOU PLAY AS MEMBERS OF THE NAZI PARTY AND ATTEMPTING TO ASSASSINATE HITLER AND SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES OF JEWISH PEOPLE IT SEEMS RESPECTFUL OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL AND I AM VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING IT WITH MY WIFE AND SOLO AND WITH A BIGGER GROUP TOO

NEW BEDFORD IS ANOTHER WORKER PLACEMENT GAME WITH A WHALING THEME WE BOTH REALLY LIKE IT DESPITE THE THEME NOT AS MUCH AS VITICULTURE BUT I LIKE IT QUITE A LOT

SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE IS A CARD GAME WHERE IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE TO PLAY BUT VERY HARD TO WIN WE LIKE TRYING TO WIN SOMEDAY IT'LL HAPPEN MAYBE IT ALSO HAS PERSISTENT CHARACTERS SO YOU CAN SPEND YOUR EARNED EXPERIENCE POINTS CALLED KARMA IN THIS GAME ON PERMANENT UPGRADES VIA STICKERS THAT YOU PUT ON YOUR CHARACTER SHEET
COULDN'T RECOMMEND JAIPUR ENOUGH I KIND OF DISREGARDED IT AT FIRST BECAUSE I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT LOOKED THAT APPEALING BUT I WILL ADMIT I WAS WRONG PEOPLE EVEN RECOMMENDED IT TO ME AS A GREAT 2 PLAYER GAME BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO GIVE IT A CHANCE IT HAS QUICKLY BECOME THE FAVOURITE 2 PLAYER GAME FOR MY WIFE AND I BUT AND COULDN'T RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY ENOUGH
I FIND TICKET TO RIDE WORKS GREAT WITH 2 AND UP
HOUNDED IS AMAZING
IF YOU LIKE CO-OP GAMES KNIERIM IS A GREAT CO-OP GAME TO PLAY WITH 2 PLAYERS GRANTED YOU CAN PLAY WITH ONLY YOURSELF IT IS OR 2 PLAYER GAME BUT BEING ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER ON A COMMON GOAL CAN MAKE IT EASY TO HAVE FUN WITH A GAME JUST DON'T USE ALL EXPANSIONS THE 2ND EDITION COMES WITH ALL EXPANSIONS IN THE GAME

WE'RE SELLING

MACAO JUST DIDN'T CLICK FOR US AND WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BETTER GAMES OR ATLEAST MORE SATISFYING GAMES THAT'S THE BETTER WORD

THERE WAS NO JAMAICA ON TABLETOP
WIKI TABLETOP
DID THEY PLAY IT DURING ONE OF THE TABLETOP DAY STREAMS
NOPE THERE HAS BEEN NO EPISODE OF JAMAICA BY TABLETOP I KNOW THIS AS BACK WHEN I CONSIDERED BUYING JAMAICA I COULD BARELY FIND ANY PLAYTHROUGH VIDEOS OF IT THAT GAVE ME A FEEL FOR THE GAME AND THE ONE THAT DID IS HERE
MAYBE YOU REMEMBER THE CATAN JUNIOR EPISODE AS THAT GAME ALSO HAS PLASTIC SHIP MINIS
I DON'T RECALL THERE EVER BEING AN EPISODE WITH JAMAICA IF THERE WAS I CERTAINLY DECLINED THE ONE TIME I WAS CAJOLED INTO PLAYING IT
PROBABLY JUST STUCK IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE THE DICE TOWER USED TO RANT AND RAVE ABOUT IT
THERE'S A DICE TOWER EPISODE WHICH BROADLY DESCRIBES THE GAME FLOW MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU REMEMBER
I'VE BOUGHT ELDER SIGN TWICE I PLAYED IT ONCE BOTH TIMES AND TRADED IT AWAY LOL
THE ONLY ONE SO FAR FOR ME IS LOVE LETTER BUT BARELY I GOT A SECOND COPY AS A SWEETENER IN A MATH TRADE THAT I PROCEEDED TO INCLUDE IN A SMALL GAMES BUNDLE IN A SUBSEQUENT MOUNT
ONLY ONE REINER RA I DIDN'T CARE FOR IT IN MY FIRST PLAYTHROUGH BUT WE PLAYED IT AS A GAME LATER ON I DECIDED I'D REALLY LIKE TO FIND A COPY AGAIN AND TRY IT AS A WHERE IT SHINES I EVEN FOUND SOMEONE WILLING TO TRADE ME A LOVELY RIO GRANDE EDITION OF THE GAME
I ACCIDENTALLY BOUGHT A COPY OF CATAN THE DICE GAME WHEN I ALREADY HAD ONE ON ORDER AT MY FAGS SO I SOLD ONE TO A CO-WORKER I THINK I'VE PLAYED IT TWICE

I SOLD THE RESISTANCE TO MY SISTER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW AS THEY WERE FLYING OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND WOULDN'T HAVE TIME TO STOP AT A GAME STORE TO PICK IT UP BEFORE LEAVING I ORDERED A REPLACEMENT COPY BEFORE THEY EVEN LEFT

ALSO IF IT COUNTS I SOLD BATMAN LOVE LETTER AND BOUGHT THE REGULAR TEMPEST LOVE LETTER

I DID SELL MICE MYSTICS BEFORE PLAYING IT AND PLAN TO EVENTUALLY IT WHEN MY GROUP HAS TIME FOR ANOTHER CAMPAIGN GAME ALSO SOLD DIXIT AND DIXIT ODYSSEY TO MY BROTHER-IN-LAW AND SISTER BUT HAVE YET TO REPLACE IT I DO PLAN TO EVENTUALLY

THERE'S ONE OTHER ONE I THINK BUT CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON WHAT IT WAS AT THE MOMENT
A FEW

TRADED AWAY AFRICA AND REBOUGHT IT YEARS LATER I HAVE A BACKUP UNPUNCHED COPY OF TITAN AND A SECOND COPY OF AGRICOLA THAT I BOUGHT ON SALE FOR BECAUSE SOMEONE STEPPED ON MY BOX A FRIEND GAVE ME A BEAUTIFUL WOODEN FRAME SO I BOUGHT A COPY OF SETTLERS OF CATAN BUT HUZZAH THE GAME WAS STILL PRETTY BORING

I GOT A COPY OF THE VERSION OF HIVE AFTER TRADING AWAY THE ORIGINAL WOOD VERSION MOSTLY SO THAT I COULD ASSAY THE TILES AND VERIFY WHAT I ALREADY KNEW WHICH IS THAT THEY'RE NOT MADE OF BAKELITE OR ANY OTHER PHENOLIC RESIN

I LOST MAGIC REALM IN A MOVE YEARS AGO MY COPY IS THE ONE I BOUGHT IN I HAVE BOTH WABASH CANNONBALL AND CHICAGO EXPRESS WHICH I THINK IS A PRETTY REASONABLE UPGRADE I ALSO HAVE AGE OF CRAFT AND COLONY BUT THAT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME THING I HAVE A SECOND COPY OF THAT SOMEONE GAVE ME

I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE THERE ARE SHELVES I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IN A WHILE
I SOLD A BIG PORTION OF MY COLLECTION WHEN I HAD TO MOVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO FAR THE ONLY ONE I'VE REACQUIRED IS AVO BUT I MAY BE GETTING FORMULA D E AGAIN THAT ONE WAS A LOT OF FUN IF WHEN JAVA GETS A REPRINT I'LL GET THAT ONE AS WELL
I'M CONSIDERING GETTING SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE AGAIN GOT IT IN MY 2ND SHIPMENT OF BOARD GAMES EVER WENT THE FUCK IS THIS WHY DIDN'T I DO ANY RESEARCH AND SOLD IT NOW THAT I KNOW THINGS I'M CONSIDERING PICKING UP A SECONDHAND COPY
I REPLACED BASE GAME PANDEMIC BECAUSE THE FIRST EDITION BOX WAS NOT AS NEAT A FIT ON MY SHELVES AS THE SECOND EDITION BOX AND I ALSO HAD CHOOSE TO EITHER BUY THE 2ND EDITION OR BUY THE UPGRADE KIT SO I COULD PLAY WITH EXPANSIONS

ESCAPE FROM COWLITZ TECHNICALLY I HAD IT AS A KID AND JUST PICKED UP THE NEW ONE
SCOTLAND YARD AND CLUED VANISHED FROM MY COLLECTION NEVER FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE RATHER BORING IN MY OPINION I GOT REPLACEMENTS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT

I'VE BOUGHT SEVERAL REPLACEMENT CARD SETS FOR SETTLERS OF CATAN BACK IN THE DAYS
LOST COLORETTO AND COSMIC WIPEOUT ON A BACKPACKING TRIP I'VE REPLACED COLORETTO AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THE NEW VERSION CAME WITH EXTRA WILDCARD THAT WEREN'T IN THE ORIGINAL I HAVEN'T YET GOTTEN A NEW COSMIC WIPEOUT BECAUSE I'M TOO SAD THAT I LOST THE ONE THAT CAME WITH A BANDANA AND A LEATHER DRAWSTRING POUCH
I'VE SOLD ALL MY HEROCLIX AND RESTARTED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEY FIRST CAME OUT IN SIDE NOTE IF ANYONE NEEDS A SHIT TON OF ALIX LET ME KNOW WINK WINK

JUST TRADED SOME GAMES FOR IMPERIAL ASSAULT SINCE THEY HAVE AN APP COMING OUT SOON SOLD IT ORIGINALLY SINCE I WASN'T A FAN OF HAVING TO HAVE A GAME MASTER
I SOLD BOMI AND GOT IT BACK AGAIN I GOT IT BACK BECAUSE IT'S GOT A LOT OF GREAT TRAITS LIKE MAGIC BUT WITHOUT THE EXCESSIVE COMPLEXITY AND KEYWORDS LIKE FIRST STRIKE SHADOW PROWESS FLASHBACK UNDYING FLYING TRAMPLE HEATPROOF ETC BOMI PLAYS FAST ONLY REQUIRES CARDS AND SETUP IS JUST A SHUFFLE AND DRAWING CARDS IT'S MY GAME BECAUSE DESPITE ALL THE FLASHY ABILITIES AND COMBINATIONS THE HEART OF THE GAME IS THAT'S BOTH ACCESSIBLE AND WINNABLE FOR ANYBODY THE NEAREST COMPARABLE GAME IS BATTLETOWN WHICH I NEED TO TRY BUT I'M TURNED OFF BY THE SETTING UP OF THE BOARD FINDING THE APPROPRIATE FIGURES AND TOKENS THE CONSTANT MOVING OF THE FIGURES THE INFORMATIONAL OVERLOAD OF THE BASES AND MODIFIERS OF BOTH ME AND MY OPPONENT AND THE OVERALL PLAY TIME
IN THE MID TO LATE I LOST MOST OF MY GAMES AND TABLETOP RAGS IN A MOVE I MANAGED TO HOLD ON TO IRON DRAGON FROM THAT TIME BUT I'VE REACQUIRED

EURORAILS
BABYLON CORE SET
CLUE OKAY I THOUGH I WAS GETTING CLUE BUT IT WAS THE CLUE MASTER SET WHICH ADDS MORE OF THE SAME PLUS CHANGES UP SOME MECHANICS AND YES I STILL THINK IT IS A SOLID DEDUCTION GAME
SCRABBLE YES ANOTHER HATED CLASSIC THAT I STILL CONSIDER TO BE A GOOD GAME
DOMINOES
MANCALA
CHESS THE ABOVE ARE CLASSICS THAT MOST HATE AND I PLAY ON RARE OCCASIONS MOSTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE TRASH TALK THESE ACCEPTABLE GAMES AND THUS NO ONE WANTS THE STIGMA OF BEING SEEN PLAYING THEM ANYMORE
THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING THE ALTERNATIVE PLOT GENERATOR FOR THE BOOKS FOCUSES ON CHARACTERS AND NOT ARMIES FREEDOM TO DO WHAT YOU WANT AND HIDDEN MOVEMENT ON BOTH SIDES WHEN MY WIFE GETS THE CHANCE AND LEARNS THE GAME I LOOK FORWARD TO A NICE OR HOUR GAME WITH HERALDRY
ICEBERGS I FOUND IT FOR CHEAP SO I ADDED IT TO MY REBUILDING TSR MINIGAME COLLECTION HOWEVER THIS ONE WASN'T THAT GOOD
SAGA ANOTHER TSR MINIGAME THAT HASN'T AGED TOO WELL IT IS VERY RANDOM AND A BIT TOO LONG FOR WHAT IT IS
VIKING GODS A THIRD TSR MINIGAME THAT I STILL ENJOY QUITE A BIT BASIC WARGAME WITH VERY SIMPLE RULES AND ACCEPTABLE PLAY LENGTH
MASTERMIND THRIFT STORE PURCHASE FOR MY WIFE WHO LOVES THE GAME IT WAS NEVER MY TYPE OF GAME BUT IF SHE ENJOYS IT THEN I'LL PLAY IT HOWEVER I PUT AN APP ON HER SMARTPHONE AND SHE PLAYS IT THAT WAY NOW
CAR WARS ACTUALLY THE RECENT REPRINT VERSION AS THE CLASSIC STEVE JACKSON POCKET GAME GOES FOR WAY TOO MUCH
OGRE POCKET EDITION ANOTHER REPRINT BECAUSE DANG THIS ONE IS EXPENSIVE IN ORIGINAL FORM IF ONLY THEY WOULD REPRINT G EAST VERB AND OTHERS IN THE SERIES
PANDEMIC ON THE BRINK OKAY NOT A BUT A FOUND A USED AND MY HAD WORN OUT CARDS SO MY WIFE AND I DECIDED TO GET A BACKUP COPY

THERE ARE A LOT OF POCKET MINI GAMES THAT I WANT TO GET AND THERE ARE A BUNCH OF VINTAGE GAMES I NEVER COULD GET BUT THANKS TO SITES LIKE BOARDGAMEGEEK AND NOBLE KNIGHT GAMES I AM FINALLY ABLE TO GET THEM MORE OFTEN THAN NOT I GET THEM OUT OF NOSTALGIA BUT I USUALLY ENJOY PLAYING THEM
I GOT PANDEMIC IN I TRADE TWICE AND TRADED IT TWICE HAHA


I ALSO GOT HIVE AFTER TRADING IT AWAY I MISSED IT
TRIED OUT DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES AND HAD A BLAST ALTHOUGH THE CROWD I PLAYED IT WITH WAS RATHER ANNOYING AND CUMBERSOME PLAYERS WIFE AND SISTER-IN-LAW SAT OUT TO CHAT WHICH WAS DISTRACTING I THINK AT OR WITH NO SIDE CONVERSATIONS IT'LL BE A BLAST

ALSO PLAYED A ROUND OF SUSHI GO I WAS A LITTLE THROWN BY THE RULES BUT IT WAS A TON OF FUN

AFER THAT PLAYED SOME CLASSIC KING OF TOKYO WHICH IS ALWAYS FUN
I'M A RELATIVE NEWCOMER TO BOARDGAMING OUTSIDE THE CLASSIC MONOPOLY RISK COMBO FROM GROWING UP SO THIS WAS THE FIRST YEAR I BOUGHT GAMES WITH ME FAMILY RESPONSE WAS MIXED MY SISTER WANTED TO PLAY JUST ABOUT EVERY GAME I HAD WHILE SOME FAMILY I EXPECTED TO BE REALLY INTERESTED IN SOME OF THE GAMES NAMELY BLUFFING ONES HAD ZERO INTEREST IN THE END

ON WEDNESDAY I GOT MY MOM AUNT AND COUSIN TO PLAY EVOLUTION WITH ME THEY HAD FUN AND MY MOM SOMEHOW MANAGED A SMASHING WIN USING A CARNIVORE BUILD AND SCAVENGER OFF IT RIGHT AFTER I HAD FINISHED EXPLAINING HOW CARNIVORES ARE USUALLY KINGMAKERS BUT NOT GAME WINNERS THEMSELVES

THANKSGIVING DAY MY MOM SISTER AND GRANDMOTHER PLAYED SPLENDOR MY GRANDMOTHER ABSOLUTELY LOVES THAT GAME AND MANAGED SOME WELL EXECUTED WINS ON US WE THEN DID A ROUND OF MILLE BARNES MOSTLY BECAUSE OF NOSTALGIA MY DAD'S FAMILY USED TO PLAY THAT WITH US A LOT WHEN I WAS A KID SO I HAD PICKED UP A COPY CHEAP FOR OLD SAKE THE OFFICIAL RULES ARE A LOT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I REMEMBERED NOT SURE IF RULES CHANGED OR IF WE HAD A LOT OF HOUSE RULES PROBABLY BOTH

BLACK FRIDAY I BROKE OUT ZOMBICIDE I HAD REALLY INTENDED TO DO CASTLES OF BURGUNDY BUT GOT OUTVOTED INITIALLY IT WAS WITH MY SISTER AND MY MOM AND MY MOM SWAPPED OUT FOR MY COUSIN WHEN SHE GOT HOME WE ENDED UP PLAYING THAT FOR WAY TOO LONG SOMETHING LIKE HOURS IN THE END I THINK I KNOW MY AUNT WATCHED 2 OF THE GODFATHER MOVIES IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND WE WERE STILL GOING WE THEN WRAPPED UP THE LATE LATE NIGHT GAMING WITH DRINKS AND SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM WHICH MY MOM GOT PROGRESSIVELY BETTER AT THE MORE SHE DRANK

I HAD HOPED TO DO BURGUNDY AS MENTIONED ALONG WITH SOME COUP AND MORE SHERIFF AS I SAW THOSE GAMES AS ONES MY FAMILY WOULD ENJOY I HAD CODENAMES STANDING BY AS WELL BUT THERE WAS LITTLE INTEREST IN THAT ASIDE FROM MY SISTER SINCE I HAD TO EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF EVERY GAME TO THEM ALL I'M NOT SURE IF I SOLD IT POORLY OR IF THEY JUST DID NOT LIKE THE CONCEPT IN THE END THOUGH I HAD A TON OF FUN AND IT WAS GREAT TO FINALLY GET SOMEONE TO PLAY ZOMBICIDE WITH I DON'T BRING THAT TO MY USUAL BOARDGAME METUMPS AS ITS A TAD AND WOULDN'T WORK WELL AT THE VENUE

I TEND TO GET GAMES IN THE MIN RANGE WITH A COUPLE EXTENDING OUT TO DUE TO THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM LOVING RISK WHEN I WAS GROWING UP NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY A 2 HOUR GAME IT FEELS LIKE MUCH LESS A HOUR ONE SINCE I GOT BACK INTO BOARD GAMING THIS YEAR I THINK MY LONGEST WAS A SHADE OVER 2 HOURS AND WAS AN PLAYER GAME OF RED DRAGON INN 2 WITH A LOT OF NEWBIE PLAYERS HENCE THE SLOWNESS AS RULES WERE CONSTANTLY EACH NEW PERSON'S TURN


DINNER DRINKS CAME ALONG WITH SOME FRIENDS FOR SOME LIGHT GAMING

CODENAMES FUN WITHOUT FAIL FIRST GAME WAS TERRIFIC I WAS PAYMASTER AGAINST A NEIGHBOR WHO WAS TALKED UP AS A REALLY GOOD PAYMASTER I GOT AN EARLY LEAD SIX OF MY CLUES DOWN TO ONLY TWO OF THEIRS IN MY FIRST TWO TURNS BUT THEN HE JUMPED BACK TO TIE UP HAD NO IDEA HOW TO GET ALL THREE OF MY REMAINING CLUES BUT GOT TWO OK MY ONLY HOPE WAS THAT HIS TEAM WOULD HIT A WALL AND ONLY GET ONE OF THEIR REMAINING TWO CLUES HE GAVE HIS CLUE AND THEN THE DEBATE AMONGST HIS TEAM BEGAN THE TWO OF US HAD A DAMN HARD TIME KEEPING A STRAIGHT FACE AS FOR THE LAST TWO CLUES THEY WERE DECIDING BETWEEN THREE TWO BEING THE CORRECT CLUES AND ONE BEING THE ASSASSIN IF I RECALL HIS CLUE WAS POLICE AND THEY WERE CHOOSING BETWEEN FORCE CYCLE AND STICK THE WINNING CLUES WERE FORCE AND STICK CYCLE WAS THE ASSASSIN THEY CHOOSE FORCE OK ONE TO GO THEY SPLIT THEIR VOTE TWO FOR CYCLE TWO FOR STICK MORE DISCUSSION AS THE GROUP CONVINCED ONE TEAM MATE THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE BICYCLE POLICE HE MUST MEAN CYCLE ASSASSIN

THEN GAVE SPYFAULT A GO I'D PICKED IT UP ON IMPULSE A COUPLE WEEKS BACK OF THE ROUNDS WE PLAYED ONLY DID ONE WHERE WE ADOPTED THE ROLES ON THE CARDS JUST KEEPING TO GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE LOCATION QUITE FUN

TO END THE NIGHT A FEW ROUNDS OF COUP I'LL ALWAYS LIKE COUP

QUESTIONS

MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY IF WE'RE TALKING PARENTS AND SIBLINGS VERY RARELY I SEE MY PARENTS TIMES A YEAR BROTHER TIMES A YEAR AND SISTER MAYBE ONCE EVERY YEARS WHEN WE DO SEE EACH OTHER YEAH THERE ARE GAMES INVOLVED IF IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEANS MY PARTNER YUP WE PLAY A FEW GAMES A WEEK SHE'S JUST AS INTERESTED AS I AM THOUGH THERE ARE SOME GAMES WHERE OUR INTEREST DOESN'T INTERSECT

LONGEST HAD A GAME OF DOMINANT SPECIES WHICH I LOVE WITH SOME SERIOUS AP PLAYERS THAT WE HAD TO CALL AFTER FOUR HOURS THE DOMINANCE DECK WASN'T EVEN HALFWAY THROUGH AT THAT TIME SO HAD WE PLAYED OUT THE FULL GAME AT THE SAME PACE WE HIT THE OR HOUR MARK EVERYONE WAS SO AFRAID OF GIVING POINTS AWAY THAT THEY'D HAVE DROPPED ACTION PAWNS ONTO THE DOMINANCE ACTION BUT BY THE TIME IT CAME TO DO DOMINATIONS BOARD STATE HAD CHANGED ENOUGH THAT THE TILES THEY'D HOPED TO PLAY DOMINATION ON EITHER HAD CHANGED DOMINANCE OR SOMEONE HAD MORE SPECIES CUBES SO YOU'D HAVE PEOPLE PASSING ON THEIR DOMINANCE ACTION BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T STAND TO GIVE OTHER PLAYERS MORE POINTS ON AN OCEAN TILE
STOCKPILE
CRY HAVOC
BEYOND BAKER STREET
ORDER OF THE GILDED COMPASS
BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL WALK
I GOT TO PLAY A PLAYER GAME OF CHICAGO EXPRESS WITH THE ERIE RAILROAD EXPANSION THE ERIE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY COMPANY WITH ONE SHARE WHICH MEANS IF YOU WIN IT IT'S ALL YOURS WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE SHARE YOU WILL ONLY GET TO CAPITALIZE IT ONCE WHICH MEANS YOU SHOULD PUT AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF FUNDS INTO IT AS IT WON'T EVER GET MORE FUNDING

ANYWAYS THERE WERE SOME HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE THE OPENING TURN HAD A RED P2 ME HAD NO SHARES P3 HAD A GREEN P4 HAD A BLUE HAD A YELLOW AND HAD NO SHARES NULL AUCTIONED I AUCTIONED RED BUT I PUT MY FULL INTO IT BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T WOULD HAVE DONE IT AND I WOULD BE OUT OF A SHARE FOR THE ROUND P3 THEN NULL AUCTIONED I WAS PROUD OF THIS GROUP BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD HOW IMPORTANT NULL AUCTIONS WERE IN THAT IT REMOVES POWER FROM A PLAYER WITH A LOT OF MONEY IT SUCKED FOR BUT IT WAS HIS FAULT THAT HE DIDN'T AGGRESSIVELY GO AFTER A SHARE IN THE OPENING BID

AT A LATER POINT IN THE GAME P3 PICKED UP THE ERIE THE ERIE EFFECTIVELY TAKES THAT PLAYER OUT OF THE GAME AS THAT PLAYER WILL ONLY BUILD THE ERIE ON THEIR TURN AFTER PLAYING WITH THAT EXPANSION I THINK I WILL KEEP IT ON BY DEFAULT WHEN PLAYING WITH OR IT KEEPS THE PLAY TIGHTER FOR THE REST OF THE PLAYERS AS THE ERIE PLAYER WILL ONLY TEND TO THEIR OWN BUSINESS THE ERIE PLAYER DID NOT HAVE FUNDS TO MAKE IT TO CHICAGO SO IT WENT BACKWARDS TOWARDS NEW YORK IT WAS BARELY ABLE TO MAKE IT AFTER IT DEVELOPED IN A FOREST HEX INSERTING 2 INTO ITS COFFERS THAT'S PROBABLY THE SECOND TIME EVER THAT I'VE SEEN THAT MOVE BEING DONE AS NORMALLY IT IS NEVER DONE

ENDED UP WINNING THE GAME AND I TIED WITH I P2 ENDED UP WITH A RED AND BLUE SHARE WHEREAS ONLY HAD A SINGLE RED SHARE THE ENTIRE GAME RED WAS SPLIT WAYS BETWEEN P2 MYSELF AND AND ALSO MADE IT TO CHICAGO IT WAS AN INTERESTING GAME AND DESPITE THE WARNINGS OF IT BEING CHAOTIC FROM MANY CRITICS I HAD A GREAT TIME WITH THIS PLAYER COUNT AND WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PLAY WITH AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD A GOOD TIME DESPITE THE GAME BEING MATHY AND CONFRONTATIONAL

CHICAGO EXPRESS IS STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES BECAUSE ONE SMALL MOVE CAN CHANGE THE PLAYER DYNAMICS SO MUCH EURO GAMES CAN BORE ME BECAUSE OF HOW SOLITAIRE A LOT OF THEM ARE AMERICAN GAMES PUNISH THOSE WHO PLAY WELL BY HAVING EVERYONE SANDBAG THE LEADER THIS GAME PROVIDES CONFRONTATION YET IT DOES SO IN AN INTELLIGENT WAY BY ENCOURAGING IT WITH INCENTIVES RATHER THAN BLINDLY ATTACKING THE LEADER THE GAME PLAYS RELATIVELY FAST AND HAS A GREAT SPREAD OF PLAYER RANGES FROM I WILL NOT PLAY THE GAME WITH 2 I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY AGAIN

DO I EVER PLAY WITH FAMILY NEVER

LONGEST GAME TWILIGHT IMPERIUM 3RD EDITION AT HOURS
I FINALLY GOT AROUND TO PLAY AMERIGO PLAYER GAME WITH FELD FANS AND IT WAS AMAZING WE LOVED THE TOWER MECHANIC THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ACTIONS YOU COULD GET ONE TURN A PLAYER NEEDED CANNONS SO HE WAITED FOR THE BLACK CUBES TO BE DROPPED ON THE TOWER AND NO ONE CAME DOWN THEY PRETTY MUCH STAYED THERE UNTIL THE NEXT ROUND LOOSING HIM LIKE POINTS AND OVERALL THE GAME AS A WHOLE
THIS FRIDAY IS ANOTHER FELDFRIDAY AND WE WILL BE PLAYING TRAJAN AND BORA BORA
LORDS OF WATERDEEP THIS GAME WAS SOO GOOD GAVE IT TO MY BROTHER FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE AND HIS F LOVED IT PLAYED ONE GAME WITH THEM WHEN IN THE WEEKEND AND IT WAS GREAT EVERYTHING SEEMS WELL BALANCED THE LORD THE BUILDINGS AND THE QUESTS ALL GIVE THE VIBE OF SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL THE MOMENT ONE GOES TO THE HARBOR AND PLAYS AN INTRIGUE CARD
ELDRITCH HORROR HAD PLAYED SOLO A COUPLE OF TIMES DECIDED TO BRING IT TO A GROUP OF FOUR PICKED THE AZATOTH AO AS THE DIMPLIEST ONE BUT SINCE I DID NOT WANT TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME PREPARING THE GAME AND RISK BORING PEOPLE I DIDN'T REMOVE THE HARD MYTHOS CARDS HOPEFUL THEY ALL PICKED UP THE RULES QUICKLY ALTHOUGH I DID KEEP EXPLAINING MANY MINOR RULES FOR THE REST OF THE GAME THREE HOURS LATER AND AFTER A SERIES OF HARD MYTHOS CARDS LESSON LEARNED WE LOST THE GAME WITH ONE MYSTERY TO SOLVE
CONCORDIA I DONT KNOW WHY I WAITED TOO LONG TO PICK IT UP AND WHEN I DID I STILL DIDNT PLAY IT RIGHT AWAY BUT NOW THAT MY GROUP HAD WE'RE IN LOVE WITH IT SUPER FUN GAME
AGRICOLA APP LOVE THIS GAME AND I USE THE IPAD APP TO PLAY GAMES AT THE SAME TIME
GALAXY TRUCKER APP I JUST DISCOVER THIS GAME AND I AM INTO THE STANDARD CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW
FOR FAMILY AND RELATIVE MY NEPHEW WILL TRY TO WIN ME IN A GAME OF STONE AGE WHENEVER WE MET
AGRICOLA FIRST TIME IT'S A NICE PLAYER COUNT PERHAPS A TAD TIGHTER THAN

SEKIGAHARA A DELIGHT OF A GAME BEEN THROUGH JUST SOME LEARNING GAMES WITH THE WIFE DIDN'T FINISH ONE YET I LOVE HOW THE GAMEPLAY REFLECTS THE BACKSTABBING AND INTRIGUING OF THE REAL BATTLE

PATCHWORK TOTAL BEGINNER BEAT ME AND I DIDN'T FEEL I MADE BAD DECISIONS I EVEN TOOK THE TILE MADE ME REALIZE THAT I ENJOY THE GAME BUT I PROBABLY DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND OPTIMAL PLAY I DON'T KNOW WHICH PIECES ARE EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU CONSIDER BOTH TIME COST
PANDEMIC INTRODUCED MY SISTER AND BROTHER IN LAW TO THIS OVER THANKSGIVING CAN'T WAIT TO INTRODUCE THEM TO A FEW MORE GAMES AT CHRISTMAS

WONDERS DUEL A GAME THE GIRLFRIEND AND I ENJOY PLAYING QUITE A BIT FAST SIMPLE AND A LITTLE BIT OF STRATEGY
PUERTO RICO APP ITS BEEN STARING AT ME FOR MONTHS NOW ASKING IF I BOUGHT IT JUST TO NEGLECT IT

ELDRITCH HORROR BASE MY FIRST PLAY THROUGH ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T FINISH BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER WANTED TO PLAY WITH ME AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE PLAYED

SUSHI GO THEN I GOT MY WIFE TO PLAY SUSHI GO HOPING IT WOULD GET HER HOOKED IT DIDN'T WORK BUT THAT'S OK ALSO I WAS STINKING DRUNK

LOVE LETTER ADVENTURE TIME ANOTHER FAVORITE OF MY AND MINE NEVER GETS OLD AND I LOVE THE THEME

SMALLSWORD APP JUST REDISCOVERED THIS ON MY IPAD ALSO NEVER GETS OLD ODDLY

WORD DOMINATION FIGURED WE'D TEST DRIVE THE OL PNP I'VE HAD SITTING AROUND FOR AWHILE NOT AS FUN AS I HAD HOPED BUT I HAD TO USE COINS INSTEAD OF CUBES AND MY KID WAS TIRED

AGRICOLA APP I WAS DREAMING ABOUT AGRICOLA LAST NIGHT AND NEEDED A QUICK FIX
WELCOME BACK TO THE DUNGEON WAS WELCOMED ADDITION TO OUR COLLECTION THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING TO GET A HOLD OF WITH A LITTLE MORE DEPTH AND INTERESTING CHARACTERS THIS VERSION STAYED DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT AND WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED PIXEL TACTICS TO GO WITH MORE OF THE SAME BUT IN A GOOD WAY LOTUS LOVED IT AND I WANT TO PLAY MORE
I STARTED PLAYING SOLITAIRE LEGENDARY THE OTHER DAY IT'S SURPRISINGLY STILL A LOT OF FUN
OVER THE PAST THREE DAYS I'VE PLAYED VAST THE CRYSTAL CAVERNS SOLO FOR THE KNIGHT THE DRAGON AND THE GOBLIN ROLES ONLY ONE LEFT TO DISCOVER IS THE THIEF BEFORE I HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER HUMAN BEING CAPABLE OF PUTTING UP WITH ME FOR MINUTES SO I CAN TRY THE CAVE ITSELF
LAST NIGHT MY WIFE AND I SAT DOWN TO PLAY WONDERS DUEL SHE IS A RELUCTANT PLAYER BUT OCCASIONALLY GETS INTO A GAME IF SHE REALLY ENJOYS THE MECHANIC THE FIRST COUPLE OF GAMES SHE WAS HESITANT AND DIDN'T SUPER ENJOY IT LAST NIGHT WAS OUR 3RD PLAY AND SHE WAS ENJOYING IT PRETTY THOROUGHLY WHEN I SPILLED A GIANT GLASS OF WATER ALL OVER THE TABLE THE MILITARY TRACK INSTANTLY RUINED HALF THE TOKENS INSTANTLY RUINED ALMOST ALL OF THE AGE II CARDS INSTANTLY RUINED IT'S COMICAL HOW QUICKLY WATER RUINED EVERYTHING I PROBABLY WON'T BE BUYING A NEW COPY OUT OF SPITE AND EVERY TIME I GET OUT MY RUINED BUT MOST LIKELY STILL PLAYABLE COPY I'LL JUST GET ANGRY AT MYSELF LOOKS LIKE NO MORE WONDERS DUEL FOR ME
HERO REALMS LOT OF FUN
I GOT THE RECENT BOARD GAME HUMBLE BUNDLE FOR ANDROID SO I PLAYED A BUNCH OF SOLO GAMES OF CARCASSONNE AGAINST THE COMPUTER AND ONE AGAINST MY WIFE AND THEN YESTERDAY WE HAD ENOUGH PEOPLE SHOW UP FOR A BIRTHDAY BOARD GAME PARTY THAT WE ACTUALLY NEEDED A PARTY GAME AND FORTUNATELY MY BLACK FRIDAY PURCHASE OF CODENAMES HAD JUST ARRIVED SO WE QUICKLY BROKE THAT OUT AND PLAYED A FEW ROUNDS
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF DAYBREAK PLAYERS EVERYONE WAS NEW TO THIS GAME AND MAFIA DEDUCTION GAMES IN GENERAL THAT SAID WE HAD SO MUCH FUN NOT ONLY PLAYING BUT THEORY CRAFTING COOL ROLE COMBINATIONS IN BETWEEN ROUNDS EVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER PRETTY WELL SO THE METAGAMING CAME ON STRONG ONCE EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD INFORMATION CONTROL AND HOW TO WEAVE AND CATCH PEOPLE WEAVING LIES
RAIDERS OF THE NORTH SEA 2 PLAYER MY FIRST TIME PLAYING AND IT IS A REALLY INTERESTING GAME THAT SURPRISED ME AT THE END SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO HOW TO OPTIMIZE WORKER PLACEMENT AS THE BLACK AND THEN GREY MEEDLESS SLOWLY BECOME INACCESSIBLE BOTH THIS AND THE HIRED WORKER OPTIMIZATION PROVIDE QUITE A FEW INTERESTING DECISIONS MORE THAN I HAD EXPECTED ON TOP OF THESE THE SPIN ON WORKER PLACEMENT PUT ONE DOWN PICK ONE UP IS FRESH AND CAN CAUSE SOME UNEXPECTED HICCUPS IN GETTING THINGS DONE EFFICIENTLY CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS WITH PLAYERS IT HAS GOT TO BE CUTTHROAT GAME IS BEAUTIFUL AND THE METAL COINS ARE COOL OVERALL I GIVE IT A THUMBS UP AND I AM HAPPY THAT I FINALLY GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY IT

LORDS OF WATERDEEP PLAYER MY SO LOVES THIS GAME AND WANTED TO INTRODUCE IT TO HER FAMILY THEY ARE NOT GAME PLAYERS BEYOND SOMETHING LIKE DUNGEON FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD SO WE PLAYED WITH NO EXPANSION IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND PROBABLY DUE TO MY OVER EXPLANATION BUT AFTER THE FIRST ROUND THEY WERE LOCKED IN AND DID QUITE WELL HER MOM HAD THE LORD THAT GOT THE BONUS FOR BUILDING HOUSES AND NO ONE WAS BLOCKING HER AND SHE WON QUITE HANDSOMELY

OVERALL LOW WILL ALWAYS HAVE A PLACE IN MY HEART AS IT WAS MY GATEWAY GAME BUT PLAYING IT WITHOUT THE EXPANSION IS JUST NOT AS FUN SINCE THE TWO GAMES ARE BOTH WORKER PLACEMENT I WOULD PROBABLY CHOSE RAIDERS AT THIS JUNCTURE IF WE HAD BUT FOR AND IT WOULD BE LORDS

MY FAMILY LIKES TO PLAY GAMES BUT MY FATHER IS A SERIOUS RULES LAWYER SOMETHING THAT I FIND MYSELF DOING FROM TIME TO TIME AND IT USUALLY GETS WORSE WHEN HE IS DOING POORLY AS A RESULT I TRY TO AVOID GAMING WITH MY FAMILY MY FAMILY SEEMED TO LIKE LORDS BUT I AM NOT SURE IF THEY LIKED GAMING AS WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET ANOTHER GAME TO THE TABLE

LONGEST GAME BOTH TEACHING AND PLAYING A PAUSE FOR DINNER TOOK ABOUT LOVED IT I WANT TO PLAY SOME OF THE BIGGER GAMES LIKE BUT GETTING THE STARS TO ALIGN IS PRETTY TOUGH
WE'RE ADDICTED TO TICKET TO RIDE USA MY GIRLFRIEND BOUGHT THIS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND IT'S GOTTEN ME INTO BOARD GAMES AS A HOBBY SUCH A SIMPLE AND FUN GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY WE'LL BE PLAYING THIS VERSION FOR A WHILE ESPECIALLY WITH THE EXPANSION RAILS AND SAILS AND EUROPE ARE ON THE MENU FOR THE FUTURE

I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT ILLUMINATI AFTER READING A BIT ABOUT HOW IT'S A CLASSIC AND HOW IT'S HELD UP OVER DECADES IT'S A BIT TOO COMPLEX FOR OUR GROUP AND MYSELF IT'S DISAPPOINTING SINCE IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A HILARIOUS AND MACHIAVELLIAN TYPE GAME WE LOVE SCHEMING AGAINST EACH OTHER BUT WE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OF THE RULEBOOK THIS ONE IS JUST SITTING ON THE SHELF FOR THE TIME BEING

COUP LOOKS LIKE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE SO I PICKED THAT UP LAST NIGHT HAVEN'T PLAYED YET BUT EXCITED TO GET INTO IT
JUNK ART ONCE AGAIN THIS PROVES TO BE A FUN GAME ABOUT STACKING OBJECTS UPON OBJECTS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY

SNOWDONIA HAD ONLY PLAYED IT SOLO PRIOR TO LAST SUNDAY WHERE MY SO AGREED TO TRY IT THE GAME WAS WAY BETTER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO BE I MEAN IT'S STILL A GREAT GAME FOR SOLO BUT I GUESS A REAL OPPONENT IS HARD TO BEAT FOR ANY GOOD SOLO VARIANT WE BOTH HAD A GOOD TIME SHOVELLING RUBBLE CONVERTING RESOURCES INTO OTHER RESOURCES AND DRAGGING WORKERS OUT OF THE PUB TO LAY SOM RAILROAD TRACKS
WEDNESDAY NIGHT

DEEP SEA ADVENTURE QUICK LIGHT GAME THAT STILL HAS A FEW DECISIONS TO BE MADE DECENT GAME THAT SERVED ITS PURPOSE AS A WARM-UP WELL ENOUGH

BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT I'VE PLAYED WITH WALK AND BOTH OF THE HAUNTS I'VE PLAYED SO FAR FROM IT HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE WORST HAUNTS I'VE EVER PLAYED MAYBE I'VE JUST BEEN UNLUCKY AND GOTTEN THE BAD ONES BUT IT'S GIVEN ME A POOR IMPRESSION OF THE EXPANSION SO FAR

WITHOUT SPOILING TOO MUCH IN THE FIRST ONE I PLAYED THE BETRAYER WON BY LOCKING DOWN ALL OF THE OTHER PLAYERS AND PREVENTING THEM FROM TAKING THEIR TURNS THERE'S A REASON LOSE A TURN EFFECTS ARE CONSIDERED BAD DESIGN THEY CREATE A NEGATIVE PLAY EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS A GRIND HOURS OF MOST PLAYERS NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME

THIS SECOND ONE WE PLAYED ON WEDNESDAY WAS ONE WERE THE BETRAYER ROLE JUMPED FROM THE BETRAYER TO HIS VICTIM WHENEVER THEY WERE ATTACKED BY HIM AND THEN THE FORMER BETRAYER STOPPED BEING THE BETRAYER OR IF THE BETRAYER COULDN'T MAKE AN ATTACK ON THEIR TURN THE ROLE JUMPED RANDOMLY EVEN FOR THIS GAME IT WAS JUST STRAIGHT RANDOM GARBAGE YOU WEREN'T MOTIVATED TO WORK TOWARD THE HEROES GOAL SINCE YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE STILL GOING TO BE A HERO BY YOUR NEXT TURN AND IF YOU DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AS A HERO AND MANAGED TO FULFILL YOUR OBJECTIVE YOU COULD STILL LOSE THE GAME IF YOU GOT TAGGED BY THE BETRAYER ON YOUR LAST TURN

MARE NOSTRUM I HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO ABSOLUTELY SWEAR BY THIS GAME BUT FOR ME IT'S JUST OK THE PROGRESSION OF THE GAME SEEMS PROGRAMMED THE GAME SPACE IS NARROW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POWERS IS HEAVILY ENTRENCHED AND WHILE I DO LIKE SOME OTHER GAMES WHERE THAT'S TRUE IE HERE I STAND THERE S NO KIND OF CLEVER CARD PLAY LIKE IN HIS TO GRANT VARIETY AND CREATE INTERESTING SITUATIONS ALSO IT TENDS TO END WITH A WHIMPER RATHER THAN A BANG SOMEONE BUYS THEIR 5TH PERSON OR EGYPT BUILDS THE PYRAMIDS IN THIS SESSION THERE WAS A SINGLE BATTLE IN THE COURSE OF 2 HOURS I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE GAME CAN GO IN A MORE DIRECTION BUT I'VE YET TO SEE THIS HAPPEN

FOR ALL OF THIS THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT I ENJOY ABOUT THIS GAME THE TRADING MECHANISM IS CLEVER AS IS HAVING THE LEADERS IN THE THREE AREAS SET THE ORDER OF ACTIONS SO IN SUM I THINK THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND ACTION SELECTION HALF OF THE GAME IS ENGAGING AND BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THE MILITARY AREA CONTROL HALF HOLDS ITS WEIGHT

FRIDAY NIGHT

TERRAFORMING MARS BACK IN MY HOME TOWN FOR THANKSGIVING I MET UP WITH SOME OLD FRIENDS I HADN'T SEEN IN A WHILE AND GOOD TIMES WERE HAD BY ALL THIS WAS ACTUALLY MY FIRST PLAY OF TERRAFORMING MARS DESPITE IT SEEING A LOT OF PLAY IN MY REGULAR GROUP I HAD ALWAYS ENDED UP IN ANOTHER GAME WHEN IT WAS GETTING PLAYED

I WAS EAGER TO TRY IT AS IT HAD BEEN GETTING A LOT OF HYPE AND BOY WAS THE HYPE JUSTIFIED THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SATISFYING HEAVY EUROS I'VE PLAYED IN A LONG TIME AS AN OLD MAGIC PLAYER I LOVE GAMES WITH LOTS OF CARDS AND GOOD HAND MANAGEMENT TABLEAU BUILDING MECHANICS AND TERRAFORMING MARS HAD GREAT ONES

I PURSUED A HEAVY FORESTATION STRATEGY AND CAME IN SECOND OUT OF GREAT GAME I ALREADY WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN TO TRY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND MODES DRAFTING SOUNDS PARTICULARLY ENTICING


PARIS CONNECTION THIS IS ONE OF THE QUEEN GAMES THAT ASMODEUS HAS BEEN CLEARING OUT FOR CHEAP SO I PICKED IT UP COOL LIGHTER GAME THAT DOES A GOOD JOB OF ABSTRACTING THE STOCK MECHANISMS OF HEAVIER TRAIN GAMES I WON AND ENJOYED IT DOWNSIDES ARE HOW IT TAKES ALMOST AS LONG TO SET UP AS IT DOES TO PLAY AND POTENTIAL LACK OF REPLAY VALUE TIME WILL TELL FOR THE LATTER

CLANK SECOND PLAY OF THIS WITH THREE PLAYERS INSTEAD OF FOUR STILL A REALLY FUN GAME THAT DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB OF CAPTURING ITS THEME THAN I EXPECTED DECK BUILDERS ARE USUALLY ABOUT MECHANICS FIRST WITH A FITTING THEME BEING ONLY A BONUS BUT HERE THE THEME FEELS REALLY

IT WAS VERY INTERESTING HOW DIFFERENT THE PACING PROGRESSION OF THE GAME WAS IN THIS SESSION COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS VERY LITTLE BUYING FROM THE OFFER TOOK PLACE IN THE EARLY GAME AND SO WE WERE MUCH MORE BUILT UP BY THE TIME DRAGON ATTACKS STARTED OCCURRING I FELT LIKE THE DECK BUILDING WAS A MUCH BETTER FIT TO THIS PACE THAN THE HECTIC MAD SCRAMBLE OF THE EXPERIENCE

THIS WAS PARTLY DUE I THINK TO IT BEING RATHER THAN THE GAME MAKES IT SO DRAGON ATTACKS ARE MORE FREQUENT THERE ISN'T REALLY ANY SCALING THAT TAKES PLACE I THINK MIGHT BE THE OPTIMAL COUNT FOR THIS GAME THOUGH ISN'T ABJECTLY TERRIBLE OR ANYTHING

REPLACEABILITY SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE A CONCERN BUT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE DECK AND THE FREQUENCY OF DRAGON ATTACKS YOU'RE UNLIKELY TO SEE MUCH OF IT IN A SINGLE GAME THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MAP HELPS A LITTLE TOO AS DOES THE VARYING EXPERIENCE WITH DIFFERENT PLAYER COUNTS DESPITE SAYING THOSE THINGS IN THE DEFENSE IT DOES SEEM LIKELY THAT A PROBLEM WITH REPLAY VALUE COULD ARISE AGAIN TIME WILL TELL

GAME OF THRONES HAND OF THE KING QUICK PLAY CLOSING OUT THE NIGHT COMPARED TO OTHER LIGHT GOT GAME ESTEROS INTRIGUE THIS IS DEFINITELY THE STRONGER GAME THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY HIGH PRAISE THOUGH SINCE ESTEROS INTRIGUE IS STRAIGHT GARBAGE I ENJOYED HAND OF THE KING THOUGH IT'S VERY CHINKY FOR SUCH A LIGHT GAME COMPARED TO WI WHERE THE DECISIONS ARE MOSTLY OBVIOUS

THERE'S CERTAINLY A FAMILIAL RESEMBLANCE WITH BRUNO OTHER LIGHT GAMES NIA AND LONGHORN IN THAT HAND OF THE KING IS A PUZZLE GAME THAT'S ABOUT CONSIDERING WHAT YOU ARE SETTING YOUR OPPONENTS UP FOR AS MUCH AS IT IS ABOUT OPTIMIZING YOUR OWN MOVEMENTS

RANDOM THOUGHTS COMPANIONS DEFINITELY NECESSARY FOR VARIETY PLAYER ORDER BALANCE A BIG CONCERN TEAM AND NEGOTIATION VARIANTS SEEM ESPECIALLY POINTLESS



DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

MY MOM WILL PLAY CARCASSONNE NOW AND THEN BUT NOT MUCH ELSE MY DAD IS FIRMLY IN THE GAMES ARE FOR KIDS WHY CAN'T YOU JUST PLAY SOMETHING NORMAL LIKE PINOCHLE CATEGORY IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I HAVE SUCH GOOD MEMORIES OF PLAYING TRIVIA GAMES WITH THEM AS A KID I TRIED TO INTRODUCE THEM TO TIMELINE BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE VERY WELL

IF YOU DON'T COUNT ASYNCHRONOUS GAMES I'VE HAD BAM SESSIONS THAT GO ON FOR MONTHS PROBABLY HERE I STAND AT HOURS


I GOT IN TWO GAMES OF TWILIGHT IMPERIUM A GAME OF BLOOD RAGE AND TWO GAMES OF SCYTHE

OUR EPIC PLAYER THANKSGIVING TWILIGHT IMPERIUM GAME RAN US OUT HOURS WITH A FINAL PUSH FOR MERCAPTOL REX IN THE LAST ROUND NOBODY ENDED UP GETTING ENOUGH TO WIN BUT THERE WAS A TIE FOR VP BETWEEN ME AND THE ACTUAL WINNER TIED PLANETS TOO BUT HE HAD TWO COMMAND COUNTERS SO HE WON GREAT GAME LOTS OF GREAT MEMORIES FROM THAT ONE AND THEY'RE STILL FRESH THIS IS CLOSE TO THE LONGEST GAME WE'VE EVER PLAYED

I PLAYED A PLAYER GAME THAT RAN HOURS PROBABLY THE FASTEST GAME OF TI THAT I'VE EVER PLAYED I LOST HARD BUT IT WAS STILL A GREAT GAME ENDED WITHOUT GOING INTO ALL OUT WAR WITH AN EARLY IMPERIUM REX CARD

BLOOD RAGE WAS A LOT OF FUN TOO I PLAYED MY FIRST GAME WITH THE 5TH PLAYER IT'S A LITTLE TOO CLAUSTROPHOBIC WITH PLAYERS BUT IT STILL WORKS REALLY WELL

SCYTHE JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER EACH PLAY OF THIS GAME IS SUPER INTERESTING I CAN'T THINK OF A GAME SINCE TWILIGHT IMPERIUM THAT HAS GOTTEN MY ATTENTION LIKE THIS ONE
I PLAYED MANSIONS OF MADNESS SECOND EDITION TWICE OVER THE WEEKEND IT WAS MY FIRST TIME PLAYING UNFORTUNATELY THE PERSON WHO WAS TEACHING US HADN'T READ THE RULES CLEARLY AT ALL WE COMPLETELY SKIPPED THE MYTHOS PHASES THE FIRST TIME AROUND AND IT TOOK ME ASKING WHAT THE DICE WERE FOR BEFORE HE CRACKED THE RULEBOOK OPEN AND FOUND THE ATTACK AND TESTS SECTIONS WE HAD TO QUIT THAT GAME EARLY THE SECOND GAME WAS INCREDIBLY ENTERTAINING THOUGH I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO PLAY SOME MORE


MANAGED TO GET A FEW GAMES IN THIS WEEKEND

BLOOD RAGE AT THREE PLAYERS LOVE LOVE LOVED IT FIRST TIME CRACKING IT OPEN AND IT WAS FANTASTIC POSSIBLY MY NEW FAVOURITE GAME I'VE BEEN CRAVING A GOOD AREA CONTROL GAME SINCE I STOPPED PLAYING RISK AS A CHILD I DIDN'T LIKE SMALL WORLD BUT THIS DEFINITELY IS MY AREA CONTROL GAME OF CHOICE NOW

DOMINION INTRIGUE USING THE SECOND EDITION UPGRADE AT PLAYERS AT 2 PLAYERS LOVING THE NEW CARDS ADD A LOT OF NEW VIABLE COMBOS
LAST FRIDAY X PLAYED THIS AT WORK WITH SOME COWORKERS THE THEME ISN'T REALLY MY THING BUT IT WAS ENTERTAINING ENOUGH WE HAD TO CUT IT SHORT OF THE LAST ROUND DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS WE THE COUNSELORS WERE DECLARED WINNERS AFTER A DECISIVE PREVIOUS ROUND OF KEEPAWAY

VAST THE CRYSTAL CAVERNS X I PLAYED THIS ON FRIDAY AT MY FAGS ONE OF THE PLAYERS WAS NEW SO THE GAME WAS LITTLE SLOW AT THE START AS THEY LEARNED HOW TO PLAY THE KNIGHT OUR CAVE PLAYER ENDED UP WINNING THIS GAME IS BEGINNING TO SOLIDIFY ITSELF AS A GAME THAT I ENJOY BUT ONE THAT DID NOT BLOW ME AWAY LIKE I ORIGINALLY EXPECTED IT TO ESPECIALLY AFTER THE HYPE GENERATED AROUND THE GAME THOUGH I HAD KICKSTARTED IT WELL BEFORE THE HYPE TRAIN BEGAN SO THIS DIDN'T PLAY INTO MY DECISION TO BUY THE GAME

MY PARENTS ENJOY PLAYING BOARD GAMES QUITE A BIT SO MY WIFE AND I WILL USUALLY PLAY AT LEAST ONE GAME WITH THEM WHENEVER WE GO OVER TO VISIT

THE LONGEST GAME I'VE PLAYED SO FAR IS PROBABLY EITHER MARKHAM HORROR WHICHEVER IS THE OLDER OF THE TWO OR RISK BOTH WERE HRS GAMES THAT I DID NOT CARE HOW THE GAME ENDED BY THE END OF IT THOUGH THE MARKHAM HORROR GAME HAD A SLEW OF OTHER ISSUES WITH IT AS WELL THAT WERE DUE TO THE PEOPLE WE PLAYED THE GAME WITH
I PLAYED BCOM WITH SOME BROS ON TABLETOP SIMULATOR EVERY TIME WE THINK WE CAN GO HIGHER THAN EASY WE PLAY ON EASY BECAUSE ITS SOMEONES FIRST TIME PLAYING AND GET A VICTORY BY THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PLAY ANYTHING IN OVER A MONTH BUT FINALLY HAD A CHANCE TO WITH THE HOLIDAY

MANAGED TO GET IN

TICKET TO RIDE REALLY ONLY ABOUT RDS OF A GAME BUT ENOUGH TO SATISFY

MYSTERIUM X 2 RAPIDLY BECOMING A FAVORITE

TINY EPIC WESTERN ENJOYED IT AT 2 PLAYERS LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE

MYSTERY EXPRESS I GOT THIS IN A MATH TRADE ALMOST A YEAR AGO BUT HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO THE TABLE MOST OF MY BOARD GAMING IS TWO PLAYER AND THIS REQUIRES THREE I ADORED IT AND THINK IT WILL MAKE A GREAT OVER DRINKS GAME WITH SOME FRIENDS HOWEVER IT HAS A LOT OF MOVING PARTS AND DEFINITELY ISN'T FOR EVERYONE

I PLAY GAMES WITH MY FAMILY ALMOST EVERY TIME I SEE THEM MY SISTER IS PROBABLY THE MOST WILLING FOLLOWED BY HER SPOUSE THEN MY MOTHER AND FINALLY MY FATHER
LORDS OF WATERDEEP



KINGDOMINO

IMHOTEP



RIFF RAFF

LIFT IT


I PLAYED

TAKENOKO I INTRODUCED IT TO MY FATHER-IN-LAW AND SISTER-IN-LAW NEITHER OF WHOM HAD PLAYED IT BEFORE MY FIL GOT BOGGED DOWN ON A PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE CARD BUT RECOVERED NICELY TO FINISH A STRONG SECOND MY SIL ACTUALLY LED MOST OF THE GAME SHE HAD OBJECTIVES DONE BEFORE EITHER MY FIL OR I HAD COMPLETED BUT SHE HIT A WALL AT THAT POINT AND FINISHED THIRD BOTH SEEMED TO LIKE THE GAME THOUGH ONE NOTE IT SEEMED LIKE THE WEATHER DIE LANDED ON THE SIDE WITH ABNORMAL FREQUENCY WHICH IS TOUGH FOR NEW PLAYERS TO DECIDE WHICH ACTION WILL WORK BEST AT THAT TIME
CODENAMES MY SIL AND I INTRODUCED IT TO THE WHOLE FAMILY WE PLAYED A TOTAL OF OR ROUNDS WITH DIFFERENT PAYMASTERS THIS WAS THE HIT OF THE DAY I THINK
SPONTANEOUS ALWAYS A HIT WITH THE KIDS BECAUSE WE'RE A VERY MUSICAL FAMILY I'M NOT A BIG FAN BUT IT'S NOT ON MY LIST
APPLES TO APPLES MY SON'S FAVORITE GAME EVEN THOUGH HE DOESN'T GET THE CLUES HALF THE TIME



FOR THE MOST PART MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY PLAY AND PARTY GAMES SEE LIST ABOVE MY IN-LAWS PLAY DOMINION AND TICKET TO RIDE AND MY DAUGHTER WILL PLAY ESCAPE THE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE WHENEVER I AGREE TO BRING IT OUT BUT THOSE ARE THE EXCEPTION

LONGEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED WAS A PLAYER SESSION OF SPARTACUS FOR WHATEVER REASON WE DECIDED TO START AT ON THE INFLUENCE TRACK I THINK THE RULEBOOK SUGGESTS STARTING AT OR SO IT TOOK FOREVER BEFORE WE HAD ENOUGH INFLUENCE TO EVEN DO MUCH WE STARTED EARLY AFTERNOON AND PLAYED UNTIL NEARLY MIDNIGHT AND EVEN THEN IT CAME DOWN TO AN ARENA BRAWL TO DECIDE THE WINNER

NEXT TO THAT I THINK THE LONGEST GAMES I HAVE PLAYED HAVE BEEN HOUR SESSIONS OF HEADLANDS BATTLE FOR SLAUGHTER GULCH OR NORMAL SESSIONS OF SPARTACUS THAT CLOCK IN ABOUT THE SAME
QUESTIONS FIRST

HOLIDAYS ARE WHEN I SEE MY PARENTS EXTENDED FAMILY AND WE ARE ALL GAMERS OF VARIOUS TYPES THANKSGIVING WAS NO EXCEPTION WE PLAYED GAMES ALMOST EACH DAY IN THE EVENING AFTER DOING STUFF DURING THE DAY CHRISTMAS NYE IS ANOTHER SUPER BIG TIME FOR US AND GAMES THEY DO PRETTY GOOD WITH ECON GAMES ESPECIALLY SHORTER ONES LIKE NEUE HEILMAN OR PARIS CONNECTION DOMINION TICKET TO RIDE I CAN'T BEAT MY PARENTS TO SAVE MY LIFE AND FIVE TRIBES HAVE ALL BEEN BIG HITS

IN PERSON IT HAS TO BE FIRE IN THE LAKE CLOCKING IN AROUND HOURS ALSO IN A STRANGE WAY IT'S STILL FIEL IF I LOOK AT MY BEM GAMES THIS PAST WINTER WE DID A MEDIUM SCENARIO AND IT TOOK LIKE MONTHS TO GET THROUGH THE ENTIRE THING THAT'S TOUGH BECAUSE THE HOLIDAYS BASICALLY SHUT DOWN THE GAME

GAMES LAST WEEK

AN INFAMOUS TRAFFIC AND MEAN GAME MATHEMATICALLY LESS SO AT I THINK THOUGH I THINK THE GAME IS SORT OF A WASTE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY CHICAGO EXPRESS SORT OF IS YOU HAVE AN ALMOST FUTILE ILLUSION OF CONTROL OVER THE GAME STATE SO MUCH SO THAT I DON'T EVEN THINK CONSERVATIVE DEFENSIVE PLAY IS ENOUGH TO HELP YOU WIN I NEED TO PLAY IT AT BEFORE I PASS JUDGEMENT BUT I THINK THIS IS A WORK OF ART EDITOR'S NOTE EXCELLENT TO LOOK AT AND STUDY NOT SO MUCH AS A GAME AND IT THEMATICALLY REALLY FITS TOGETHER FROM MY STUDY OF THE TIME PERIOD THE USE OF REVENUE AS A MARKER INSTEAD OF INCOME IS SIMULTANEOUSLY AGGRAVATING AND BRILLIANT I THINK THE SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME IS WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF PHIL EKLUND CREATED THE OFFSPRING OF CONTAINER AND THE KING IS DEAD AND MADE IT REALLY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING OF SUBSTANCE YOU MUST PLAY FAST IT OVERSTAYS ITS WELCOME ON THE TABLE AFTER ABOUT MINUTES AND REALISTICALLY SHOULD BE DONE IN AN HOUR

PARIS CONNECTION VARIOUS COUNTS I'VE NOW SEEN WINNING SCORES OF AND LOSING SCORES OF I THINK I'VE PLAYED MORE PC THIS MONTH THAN I HAVE ANY OTHER GAME ALL YEAR CLOSE TO GAMES OF IT BY MY MATH IT'S ON SALE ON AMAZON TODAY GO BUY IT FOR ONCE I'LL AGREE WITH JCL THAT THE HIDDEN TRACKABLE INFORMATION IS A DETRIMENT AND JUST KEEP THE RECEIVED SHARES IN FRONT OF THE SCREENS SHARPENS AND SIMPLIFIES THE INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT IN THE GAME AND INCREASES THE CRITICAL DECISION RATIO IN THE GAME

NEUE HEILMAN MY ELDERLY MOTHER IS SOMETHING ATROCIOUS LIKE OUT OF GAMES FOR HER WIN RECORD AND I THINK I'VE WON ALL OF 2 GAMES AGAINST HER BUT THIS WAS ONE OF THEM TIMED MY CASH LIQUIDATION PERFECTLY TO GUARANTEE MY ROW FINISHED WHICH SAVED ME ONE OF THE BEST RISK CHAOS MANAGEMENT GAMES I HAVE DEVILISH LITTLE GAME I'D FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I ENJOY IT
BIG WEEK OF GAMING FOR SURE ON MONDAY PLAYED A MEGA GAME OF NETRUNNER WITH THE TWO OTHER GUYS THAT NORMALLY SHOW UP RATHER THAN HAVE TWO GUYS PLAY AND ONE TWIDDLE THEIR THUMBS WE DECIDED TO PLAY THREE GAMES AT ONCE WE SAT IN A TRIANGLE AND EACH PLAYED RUNNER ON THE LEFT AND CORP ON THE RIGHT IT WAS A BLAST AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING IT AGAIN TONIGHT

AT THANKSGIVING ON THURSDAY GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY A COUPLE LIGHT GAMES WITH THE FAMILY PLAYED KING OF TOKYO AND SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM WITH MY WIFE AND SOME OF OUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS HAD A BLAST WE JUST GOT MARRIED THIS SUMMER AND THIS WAS MY FIRST OFFICIAL HOLIDAY AS THE FUN UNCLE I LOVE IT

PICKED UP KING OF NEW YORK ON FRIDAY AND PLAYED A COUPLE GAMES OF THAT WITH MY WIFE AT THE NEW FAGS IN TOWN IT'S OKAY PROBABLY BETTER WITH A GROUP THAN ON ALSO PLAYED A LITTLE DOMINION

SATURDAY WAS AN EXCELLENT AFTERNOON EVENING OUR FRIEND NICK FROM OUT OF TOWN WAS IN TOWN FOR THANKSGIVING SO HE CAME OVER FOR SOME GAMES WITH MY WIFE OUR ROOMMATE TOM AND I FIRST WE PLAYED A GAME OF ECLIPSE MY WIFE WON FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN YEARS OF PLAYING SHE WAS VERY EXCITED SHE WAS PLAYING AS ORION WHICH SHE HAS PLAYED BEFORE BUT NEVER WON VERY WELL PLAYED ON HER PART

AFTER ECLIPSE TOM HAD TO GO TO WORK SO NICK THE WIFE AND I DECIDED TO PLAY LORDS OF WATERDEEP NICK HAD NEVER PLAYED IT BEFORE BUT REALLY LIKE IT HE ASKED TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH HE ALSO WON BOTH GAMES QUICK LEARNER HAHA

AT THIS POINT IT WAS PROBABLY AROUND OR AND MY WIFE WAS ASLEEP ON THE COUCH SO IT WAS DOWN TO NICK AND I WITH NEITHER OF US HAVING ANYTHING IMPORTANT TO WAKE UP FOR IN THE MORNING PRIME TIME FOR STAR WARS REBELLION

NICK PLAYED THE REBELS AND I PLAYED THE GOOD GUYS IT WAS ACTUALLY THE FASTEST GAME OF REBELLION I'VE SEEN SO FAR FOUND HIS BASE SUPER EARLY AND THEN FOUND IT AGAIN QUICKLY WHEN HE MOVED IT MOPPED UP BY ROUND HAHA
LAST WEEK FOR THANKSGIVING ME AND MY FRIENDS DECIDED TO STAY UP AND WAIT FOR BLACK FRIDAY BY PLAYING BOARD GAMES WE MANAGED A HOUR BOARD GAME MARATHON FROM PM TO AM WHERE WE PLAYED IN ORDER TERRA MYSTIC FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE SPADES DOMINANT SPECIES AND BLOODBORNE THE CARD GAME IT WAS LOADS OF FUN AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE EVER PLAYED TERRA MYSTIC AND FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE WHICH WE BOTH CONCLUDED WERE BOTH AWESOME JUST FROM ONE PLAY LAST YEAR WE DID SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE WE PLAYED FIRE IN THE LAKE AND A FEW OTHER GAMES BUT I THINK THAT THIS YEAR WAS A GOOD BIT BETTER

I DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY SINCE THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE INTERESTED

THE LONGEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED WAS AN HOUR GAME OF FIGHTING FORMATIONS GROSSDEUTSCHLAND MOTORIZED INFANTRY DIVISION I WAS PLAYING THE GERMANS AND MY FRIEND WAS THE RUSSIANS AND I EVENTUALLY ENDED UP CONCEDING ROUNDS EARLY SINCE MOST OF MY PANZERS WERE INOPERATIVE AND I LOST MY PIONEERS WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE OBJECTIVE TIMES EASIER
I PLAYED THE GAME ZOMBIES WITH MY DAD STEPMOTHER AND MY LITTLE BROTHER ON SUNDAY TOOK A WHILE TO GET THE HANG OF THE RULES EVENT CARDS AND SUCH BUT IT WAS FUN IN THE END MY STEPMOM ENDED UP WINNING WHICH WAS GOOD
WE PLAYED BOARDGAME ORGANIZATION SIMULATOR AKA WE SPENT 2 DAYS CLEANUP THE COLLECTION
THIS WEEK I PLAYED IMPERIAL SETTLERS TWO PLAYERS IT WAS PRETTY FUN IT WAS ACTUALLY MY SCORE FROM THE BOARD GAMES GIFT EXCHANGE
I'VE GOT A FEW THINGS I'LL HAVE TO LOOK UP BUT IT WAS GREAT FUN

LONGEST GAME MARKHAM HORROR HOURS I BELIEVE OVER TWO DAYS
THIS WEEK WE'VE ONLY PLAYED WITH THE TWO OF US AND WE PLAYED

I PLAYED TROYES TWICE I RECEIVED IT IN THE MAILBOX LAST WEEKEND WITH THE EXPANSION LADIES OF TROYES THE FIRST TWO GAMES WE PLAYED WITHOUT THE COMPONENTS OF THE EXPANSION AND BOTH GAMES WERE WITH 2 PLAYERS I REALLY LIKE THE CHARACTER CARDS AND WE'VE PLAYED WITH OPEN AND CLOSED BUT I THINK I'M GOING TO TRY 2 CLOSED NOW I'M LOOKING FORWARD IN PLAYING THE GAME AGAIN SO DOES MY SO ALTHOUGH SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME SPARK AS WITH CASTLES OF BURGUNDY OR BRUGES

WHAT I DIDN'T GET IS WHY THE SAME CHARACTER CARDS ARE PRESENT IN THE EXPANSION AS IN THE BASE GAME THINK IT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY AH WELL

ON SATURDAY WE'VE PLAYED A GAME OF BRUGES THE ROLES WERE EXTREMELY HIGH AND I HAD SOME LUCK OF THE DRAW IN THE END WITH CARDS THAT SCORED AND POINTS WHICH INSTANTLY WON ME THE GAME WE BOTH REALLY ENJOY THE GAME AND IT'S IN OUR TOP FOR SURE CAN RECOMMEND IT
ECLIPSE ON IOS IT'S FUN I DON'T HAVE TO REMEMBER A BILLION RULES SET UP A TRILLION THINGS AND FIND A FEW OTHER PEOPLE AND CONVINCE THEM TO PLAY ECLIPSE ALSO BECAUSE I SUCK AT THE GAME I CAN SWITCH ALL THE AI TO PEACEFUL AND THEN DESTROY THEM

TINY EPIC GALAXIES I'M STILL AT THE OH SHIT I FORGOT THAT RULE OF LEARNING TO PLAY THE GAME BUT I'M LIKING IT SO FAR WILL HAVE MORE FUN ONCE I START GETTING A HANG OF THE RULES
GOT A GAME IN OF PATCHWORK WITH MY SISTER FIRST TIME PLAYERS THE BOTH OF US BUT I MASSACRED HER TO BEING MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE RULES DUE TO WATCHING YOUTUBE VIDEOS CERTAINLY HELPED TO BE SURE THAT'S OK THOUGH BECAUSE AS ALWAYS I WAS HUNG OUT TO DRY WHEN WE PLAYED SCRABBLE SHE'S A MONSTER
DIDN'T WIN MUCH THIS WEEK BUT HAD AN INCREDIBLE WEEK OF GAMING

KING OF TOKYO W POWER UP P PLAYED THIS WITH SOME FRIENDS OVER DINNER AND WITH MY COUSINS AFTER THANKS GIVING WENT OVER REALLY WELL SOME ASKED ME WHERE THEY COULD GET IT WHICH IS MY FAVORITE QUESTION I GET ASKED

KEYFLOWER SECOND PLAY OF THIS AND NONE OF THE TILES I WANTED CAME OUT NO WOOD PRODUCTION WITHOUT SAWS AND NO SAWS COMING OUT ENDED UP IN A DISTANT THIRD BUT THE TWO OTHER PLAYERS REALLY FELT THE TENSION MESSED UP THE WAY BOATS ARE BID ON IN THE WINTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY COST ONE GUY THE WIN MB

DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG PLAYED WITH THE COUSINS AFTER THANKSGIVING DINNER ONE KID KEPT TRYING TO CHEAT SO I WAS WORRIED WHEN WE LET HIM BE THE FORENSIC SCIENTIST TO MY SURPRISE HE HELD HIMSELF BACK FOR THAT ROUND

DUNGEON PETZ FIRST TIME PLAYING THE THEME AND COMPONENTS WERE REALLY EXCITING TO ME BUT I WAS SO CONFUSED THAT FIRST ROUND MY ONLY GOAL WAS TO NOT LET ME PETS DIE WHICH BECAME VERY DIFFICULT AS MY PETS WERE POOP MACHINES ALSO I FELT LIKE TAKING ACTIONS THE LAST ROUND DIDN'T REALLY HELP MUCH OTHER THAN THE SELLING SPACE AND THE BRIBING SPACE I'D DEFINITELY TRY IT AGAIN

EVOLUTION A RECENT PURCHASE AND HIT WITH MY FRIENDS AND EVEN MY BROTHERS FRIENDS THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT REALLY STARVED OUT MY CARNIVORE GOT STARVED OUT BY WARNING CALLS AND BURROWERS AND THE FOOD FLUCTUATED BETWEEN FOOD TO FOOD PER TURN IT WAS A RUN AWAY GAME BUT THE THEME ALWAYS MAKES THIS A FUN GAME FOR ME

AVALON HAVENT PLAYED THIS GAME IN OVER A YEAR PLAYED AT A MEET UP I HAD A HARD TIME GETTING INTO IT SO COULD NEVER COME UP WITH A CONVINCING LIE I WAS MORGAN LA FEY BOTH TIMES SO I JUST KEPT PRETENDING TO VOTE LIKE MERLIN TO AT LEAST CONFUSE COERCIBLE MUCH RATHER PLAY DECEPTION

ISLE OF SKYE JUST RECEIVED THIS IN A MATH TRADE AND MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WERE EXCITED TO GET IT TO THE TABLE HER LITTLE SISTER ASKED TO COME OVER AFTER FINISHING HOMEWORK SO SHE JOINED US IN PLAYING WITH SOME FRIENDS SHE DID REALLY WELL AND MY F AND I ENJOYED THE EXPERIENCE MUCH MORE THAN THE WE'VE HAD REALLY WANT TO GET THIS OUT AGAIN

BETWEEN TWO CITIES ALSO FROM RECENT MATH TRADE AND WITH F AND HER SISTER THIS ONE WAS A HIT WE WERE LAUGHING AND YELLING AS MY FRIEND REALIZED WE WORK TERRIBLY TOGETHER

QUESTION I TRY TO PLAY GAMES WITH MY FAMILY EVERY SO OFTEN BUT MY PARENTS ARE RARELY IN TOWN WHEN THEY ARE I TRY TO GET A GAME GOING BUT MY DAD GOES TO BED EARLY LIKE SO ITS HARD I ALWAYS TRY TO GET MY BROTHER TO PLAY WITH ME AS HE IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT WOULD PLAY SOME OF THESE MORE AGGRESSIVE GAMES WITH ME

QUESTION 2 I ONCE PLAYED A HOUR GAME OF LOW 2 PLAYERS WERE NEW BUT STILL I WAS DYING I WILL NEVER PLAY WITH AGAIN


I TRIED NOTTINGHAM WHICH IS A SET COLLECTION GAME INTERESTING BUT IT HASN'T AGED WELL

I ALSO TRIED GARDEN DICE WHICH I ALSO THOUGHT WAS FINE FOR WHAT IT IS BUT A LITTLE FRUSTRATING IN ITS USE OF DICE IF YOU DON'T ROLL HELPFUL NUMBERS LATE YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE
THIS WEEK I PLAYED

KING OF TOKYO POWER UP EXPANSION I THINK THE EXPANSION DREW THE GAME OUT LONGER TWO PEOPLE GOT KNOCKED OUT EARLY AND IT WASN'T SO GREAT FOR THEM

DIAMONDS PLAYED THIS TWICE AP REALLY MAKES THE GAME DRAG BUT IT WAS PRETTY FUN

CATAN IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE PLAYED CATAN I CAN REMEMBER WHY I ENJOYED IT BUT I ALSO REALLY REMEMBER WHY I STARTED MOVING AWAY FROM IT PARTICULARLY THIS GAME WHEN MY NUMBERS WERE NOT ROLLED

THIS GAME WAS AMUSING BUT IT'S SO SUBJECTIVE I GUESS THAT'S PART OF THE FUN BUT IT DOESN'T DO WELL WITH MY STRUCTURED AND COMPETITIVE NATURE


I ALSO SPECTATED CODENAMES BEING PLAYED AND HAD A ROCKY INTRO TO MAHJONG



MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY WILL WILLINGLY PLAY AS LONG AS THEY AREN'T SUPER TIRED THOUGH THEY DEFINITELY PREFER LIGHTER AND FASTER GAMES I NEED TO FIND MORE OF THOSE THAT ARE ENGAGING AND DIFFERENT TO KEEP MY INTEREST IN THE GAME

THE LONGEST HAVE I'VE PLAYED WOULD PROBABLY BE GAME OF THRONES THE GAME LASTED ABOUT HOURS AND WAS DRAWN OUT WITH A LOT OF AP AND LEARNING I THINK THE GROUP LEFT UNDERSTANDING THE GAME AND WILLING TO PLAY AGAIN BUT IT'S HARD TO GET THE SAME GROUP IN THE MOOD FOR THAT LONG OF A GAME
CODENAMES PICTURES

ARBORETUM

CAN'T STOP

BLOOD BOWL OH MAN THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY TO BE PLAYING IT AGAIN PARTICIPATING HOPEFULLY SOON IN A GW STORE VS GW STORE GRUDGE LEAGUE

QUESTIONS

MY WIFE AND I GAME A LOT TOGETHER USUALLY W OUR OTHER COUPLE FRIENDS MY WIFE'S FAMILY MANY ARE DOWN TO PLAY WE'LL DO BG AN RPG HERE AND THERE DEPENDS UPON WHO IS IN TOWN

LONGEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED WAS FUN BUT IT WAS JUST TOO LONG I THINK THAT ROUND WAS ABOUT HOURS LONGEST I CAN TOLERATE ANYMORE IS A HERE I STAND WHICH CAN BE LENGTHY BUT IF PEOPLE DON'T AP OUT TOO HARDCORE AND ACTUALLY THINK WHEN IT'S NOT THEIR TURN IT'LL TAKE
BORA BORA I REALLY ENJOY BORA BORA AND CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY AGAIN IT WAS MY FIRST GAME AND NOW I INTEND TO BUY A COUPLE MORE

EL GRANDE I RECENTLY BOUGHT THE BIG BOX AND IT WAS THE SECOND TIME I PLAYED SO WE USED ONLY THE BASE GAME

CARCASSONNE WITH THE DRAGON AND THE PRINCESS EXPANSION I DON'T LIKE THIS EXPANSION I PREFER TO PLAY THE BASE GAME INSTEAD

FAIRY TALE A LIGHT CARD DRAFTING GAME THE CARDS MAY TRIGGER AN ACTION FLIPPING OR UNCLIPPING OTHER CARDS BUT IN THE END IT'S JUST ANOTHER CARD DRAFTING GAME
WHERE WE SCORE POINTS BASED ON THE CARDS WE DRAFTED AND THEIR COMBINATIONS I THINK THE GAME IS FUN BUT I PLAY IT MORE OFTEN THAN I WOULD LIKE BECAUSE MY GAMING GROUP
ALWAYS ASKS ME TO BRING IT

DID A BUNCH OF THANKSGIVING GAMING WITH ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS WAS GO AWAY MONSTER WITH OUR NEPHEW AND NIECE YEARS OLD WE GOT TO BREAK THE SHRINK ON THE GAME AND THEY REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING IT WE ALSO PLAYED SOME PARIS CONNECTION WITH THE GERMANY AND IBERIA EXPANSION MAPS WHICH ADD SOME NEW THINGS

I LIVE A HOUR DRIVE AWAY FROM MY BROTHER AND PARENTS SO I DON'T GAME WITH THEM THAT OFTEN BUT WHEN WE VISIT WE PLAY GAMES WITH THEM MY HUSBAND SHARES THE SAME INTERESTS AS ME IN GAMING SO HE'S MY MAIN GAMING PARTNER

THE LONGEST GAME I'VE PLAYED IS PROBABLY AT HOURS NOT SURE THOUGH ALSO TOOK HOURS
TWILIGHT IMPERIUM THIRD EDITION EASILY MY FAVORITE GAME THERE IS A GROUP OF FOUR OF US AND A GAME LASTS ABOUT HOURS BY NOW WE TRY TO PLAY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR THIS SESSION WAS EASILY ONE OF THE BEST

ABOVE BELOW I LOVE TEACHING THIS GAME AND SEEING HOW PEOPLE REACT TO IT LOOKING FORWARD TO NEAR FAR
MONIKERS THIS ONE IS HUGE WITH ONE OF MY GROUPS WE PLAYED SEVEN ROUNDS EACH MORE HILARIOUS THAN THE LAST THE LAST ROUND WAS ONE I DISCOVERED ON THE MUSD FORUMS WHERE YOU HAVE TO CRAWL UNDER A SHEET AND GIVE CLUES IN THE FORM OF CLOAKED GYRATIONS I ADDED THE RULE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE ON YOUR BACK THE WHOLE TIME FRIEND CRAWLS UNDER THERE AND STARTS FLAILING AROUND MANIACALLY WHICH CAUSES EVERYONE TO CRACK UP ESPECIALLY ME BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS BUT I'M ON THE OTHER TEAM AND HIS TEAM DOESN'T GET IT AND THEN IT'S MY TURN TO CRAWL UNDER THE SHEET AND I DO THE EXACT SAME THING WHICH CAUSES HIM TO CRACK UP WHICH THEN CAUSES ME TO CRACK UP EVEN MORE TWO ADULT MEN SUPINE VIOLENTLY THRASHING AROUND UNDER A SHEET IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET ONE OF THE TEN PEOPLE CROWDED AROUND THEM TO SAY JABBERWOCKY HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF MY BEST GAMING MOMENTS OF ALL TIME

SAN DUO SHA THIS CHINESE BANG CLONE IS SWEET IT'S THE GAME THAT GOT ME INTO BOARD GAMING ORIGINALLY MOST OF THE CHARACTERS HAVE STRONGER POWERS THAN THEIR BANG COUNTERPARTS BUT EVEN BETTER A LOT OF POWERS ARE BASED IN THE ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS LORE

MYSTERIUM DON'T HAVE A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THIS ONE OTHER THAN EVERYONE ENJOYED IT I DID NOT PLAY THIS WITH MY REGULAR GROUP MY FRIEND OWNS IT AND I'M GOING TO GIVE HER MY COPY OF DIXIT WHICH IS A GAME I DON'T REALLY ENJOY IT SEEMS LIKE THE DIXIT CARDS COULD DEFINITELY SUPPLEMENT THE MYSTERIUM ONES

SYLVIAN CASTELLATION THESE TWO HAVE REALLY SET MY SOUL ON FIRE ESPECIALLY CASTELLATION BRILLIANT SOLO DESIGN I FELT REALLY SMART AND CAPABLE THE WHOLE TIME WHILE ALSO IMMERSED IN THE TENSION AND CHALLENGE OF THE GAME LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING OUT THE TWO PLAYER VERSIONS WITH MY ROOMMATE LATER THIS WEEK DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO GET KNIERIM THOUGH I WATCHED A PLAYTHROUGH OF IT AND IT DIDN'T SEEM AS GOOD AS THESE TWO PERHAPS SOMEONE CAN CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE

CODEX I PURSUED A HERO PUSHDOWN BUILD AND MY OPPONENT PLAYING MONOGREEN HAD NO IDEA HOW TO BEAT IT TECH IN FOX'S DEN STUDENTS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE DEFEND MAX LEVEL SETSUKI WITH EVERYTHING THEN PLAY TWO FOX'S DEN STUDENTS PER TURN AND DESTROY ALL THEIR TECH BUILDINGS AND BASE BEFORE THEY CAN GET TO TECH 2 TOWER DOESN'T HELP BECAUSE OF SAFE ATTACKING SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY COUNTERS ARE CARDS LIKE SNAPBACK OR ORIGIN STORY WHICH AREN'T AVAILABLE IN EVERY COLOR HOW DOES RED GREEN BLUE BEAT A STRATEGY ESPECIALLY BEFORE TECH 2

UNRELATED TO THE QUESTIONS PROVIDED BUT SOMETHING I WANTED TO DISCUSS AS I'VE GOTTEN DEEPER INTO BOARDGAMING I'VE FOUND MYSELF SKEWING MORE TOWARDS SIMPLER SHORTER GAMES MANY WITH A BLUFFING LYING ELEMENT IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER THIS IS BECAUSE I'M BETTER UNDERSTANDING MY TASTES OR IF IT'S BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE I'M ABLE TO PLAY WITH I THINK IT'S A LITTLE OF BOTH RULES EXPLANATIONS FOR SOME GAMES I LOVE DOMINANT SPECIES MAGE KNIGHT FORBIDDEN STARS ARE INCREDIBLY TIME-CONSUMING AND I'M ALWAYS WORRIED PEOPLE ARE LOSING INTEREST IT'S ALSO HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SHOW UP PERHAPS THIS IS JUST BECAUSE I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT BUT I'VE NEVER HAD A STABLE GROUP OF SAY PEOPLE WITH WHOM I CAN PLAY GAMES LIKE ARCHIPELAGO AND REALLY EXPLORE THE DEPTH OF THE GAME

ONE EXCEPTION TO THIS HAS BEEN CAPTAIN SONAR WHICH HAS BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS DESPITE ITS LENGTHIER RULES EXPLANATION I THINK IT'S JUST BECAUSE THE GAME IS SO DAMN GOOD HAS ANYONE ELSE FOUND THEIR GAMING MOVING TOWARDS SHORTER MORE SOCIAL GAMES HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS

ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES IS WHEN HUGE LIANG LEGENDARY CHINESE GENERAL WAS IN A CITY WHEN AN ENORMOUS ENEMY ARMY ARRIVED HE ORDERED THE CITY GATES TO BE FLUNG OPEN AND HE WAS JUST SITTING ON THE CASTLE RAMPARTS PLAYING AN INSTRUMENT THE ENEMY COMMANDER WAS SO SHOCKED BY THIS THAT HE ORDERED HIS ARMY TO FULLY RETREAT SUSPECTING AN AMBUSH IN REALITY HUGE LIANG HAD NO ARMY AND HAD COMMITTED TO ONE OF THE MOST BADASS BLUFFS IN HUMAN HISTORY
GOOD GAMES WEEK

GAMES OF BONANZA WERE AND WAS THE GAME WAS NUTS IN THE SENSE THAT WE FINISHED IN A TIE AND THE TIE BREAKER IS WHO HAS THE MOST CARDS IN THEIR HAND AND WE EACH HAD CARDS IN OUR HAND

GAME OF FIVE TRIBES I WON THIS ONE BUT BARELY LOVE THIS GAME AND NONE OF MY GROUP SUFFERS FROM AP SO THE GAME WENT BY QUICKLY

MY BROTHER IS A BIGGER GAMER THAN ME SO I'LL JOIN HIS GROUP MAYBE ONCE A MONTH

2 LONGEST GAME MIGHT BE MY FIRST GAME OF ANDROID IT WAS CLUNKY AND WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE RULES AND IT'S A MASSIVE GAME SO IT WAS ABOUT


ISLE OF SKYE HAD BEEN WANTING TO PLAY THIS SINCE I SAW IT IN THE SD NOMINEE LIST AND FOUND OUT IT HAD MY LAST NAME AS A CLAN YOU COULD PLAY ALSO I LOVED THE THEME OF BREWING SCOTCH AND THE FACT THE MECHANICS WERE SIMILAR TO CARCASSONNE BUT WITH A GREAT MARKETPLACE PHASE ADDITION ENDED UP REALLY LIKING IT NOT SURE IF I'D BUY IT BUT DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN PLAYING IT AGAIN

LIBERALIA SECOND TIME PLAYING REALLY LIKE THIS GAME WE DIDN'T GET ANY REALLY GOOD COMBOS THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS BUT THEN THE THIRD ONE WAS PRETTY WILD FUN GAME DEFINITELY SOMETHING I WANT TO PLAY AGAIN OR EVEN PICK UP IF I FIND IT USED OR ON SALE

HOKKAIDO HAD WATCHED THE TABLETOP EPISODE OF THIS GAME BEFORE BUT NEVER PLAYED IT FAIRLY INTERESTING GAME I DON'T THINK I BLOCKED ENOUGH OR SKIPPED AHEAD ENOUGH AND ENDED UP DOING FAIRLY POORLY BUT ENJOYED THE RIDE NOT SURE THIS IS ONE I'D REALLY NEED TO PLAY AGAIN

ACQUIRED BUT DIDN'T PLAY BCOM HAVE PLAYED IT ONCE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING AGAIN ONCE I CAN GET PEOPLE TO TRY IT GUILDHALL GOT IN A TRADE HAVENT LOOKED AT IT MUCH HOPEFULLY TRY IT OUT SOON
PLAYED A FEW GAMES FROM THE PYRAMID ARCADE BOX WITH THE BF BETWEEN TURKEY AND DESSERT ON THANKSGIVING

ON SATURDAY IT WAS GAME NIGHT AT THE FAGS STARTED OFF WITH A PLAYER GAME OF VANILLA EVOLUTION THEN MOVED ONTO A PLAYER GAME OF MYSTIC VALE SINCE SOMEONE HAD IT AND I HAD BEEN WANTING TO TRY IT THE BF FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GAME IMMEDIATELY AND COMPLETELY FORGOT I TOLD HIM ABOUT IT MONTHS AGO HE ENDED UP BUYING IT PLUS THE EXPANSION THE NEXT DAY

NEXT UP WITH A PLAYER GAME OF LORDS OF WATERDEEP I ALWAYS DO REALLY GOOD IN THIS GAME AND MANAGED TO WIN IN THE END HAD THE LEADER DUDE WHERE I GOT POINTS FOR EACH EXPANSION QUEST COMPLETED AND BUILDING BUILT GOT LUCKY AND ALL QUESTS I GOT AND COMPLETED WERE EXPANSION ONES ONLY ONE BUILDING THOUGH WAS STILL A NICE AMOUNT OF POINTS AT THE END

AFTER THAT PLAYED A PLAYER GAME OF HOKKAIDO ALWAYS RELAXING AND IS ANOTHER GAME I TEND TO ALWAYS DO VERY WELL IN ENDED UP WINNING THIS ONE AS WELL

NEXT WAS A PLAYER GAME OF TIGRIS EUPHRATES FINALLY GOT TO PLAY THIS AT THE FULL PLAYER COUNT AND REALLY ENJOYED IT I KEPT UP MY WINNING STREAK AND WON THIS GAME WITH A MODEST SCORE OF IN BLUE RESOURCES

LAST GAME OF THE NIGHT WAS A PLAYER GAME OF LANTERNS ALWAYS A GREAT GAME TO PLAY ESPECIALLY WHEN EVERYONE AT THE TABLE IS EXPERIENCED I ENDED UP TIED FOR FIRST AT THE END BUT LOST TO THE TIE BREAKER

ALSO A FEW DIGITAL GAMES OF HOKKAIDO THE BF IS PART OF THE BETA FOR THE PHONE VERSION AND ASCENSION OVER THE LONG WEEKEND

QUESTIONS

PRETTY MUCH NEVER THE CLOSEST IS THE BF AND HIS MOTHER

A PLAYER GAME OF TWILIGHT IMPERIUM IT WENT ON FOR HOURS AND WE EVEN CALLED IT EARLY
SKULL LOVE LETTER CODENAMES FUNDUS NOVUS AND AN OLD FAMILY CARD GAME NO ONE HERE WILL HAVE HEARD OF
BLOOD RAGE IS OUT NEW ADDITION AND WE HAVE BEEN GETTING IT TO THE TABLE ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY
NICE I WAS HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS I PLAYED QUITE ALOT WE GOT IN MULTIPLE GAMES OF COSMIC ENCOUNTER A GAME OF ELDRITCH HORROR AND A GAME OF ROBISON CRUSOE
I DON'T NORMALLY GET TO PLAY THIS OFTEN SINCE MY GAMING FRIENDS AND I ALL GO TO DIFFERENT COLLEGES BUT IT IS GREAT TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO PLAY A TON
AS FOR OUR LONGEST GAME WHICH REALLY ISN'T THAT LONG WAS PROBABLY A HOUR GAME OF THE GOT BOARD GAME WITH PEOPLE

BOARDGAMING OVER THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY WITH SIBLINGS NIECES AND NEPHEWS CODE NAMES CHAOS MARAUDERS SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE MY FIRST TRY AT BOSS MONSTER

THE LONGEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED IS HERE I STAND WHICH TOOK ABOUT TWELVE HOURS IT'S A SIMULATION OF THE PROTESTANT REFORMATION AND THE SHENANIGANS MILITARY POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS GOING ON IN EUROPE AT THE TIME

MY SONS LOVE BOARDGAMING MY DAUGHTER ENJOYS IT ON OCCASION MY SPOUSE HAS A FEW GAMES TICKET TO RIDE CODE NAMES CARCASSONNE THAT SHE LIKES ENOUGH TO PLAY BUT SHE'S NOT AS MUCH INTO THE HOBBY AS THE REST OF THE FAMILY
GOT A LOT IN THIS PAST WEEK BUT ONE GAME REALLY STOOD OUT ESCAPE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE I TRY TO PLAY A GAME WITH MY SON HE'S SEVEN BEFORE HE GOES TO BED AS A WAY TO END OUR DAY WE PLAYED THIS LAST NIGHT WITH MY WIFE

WE WON BUT BARELY AT THE END HE SAT THERE RATHER INTENSELY STARING AT THE GAME HE THEN LOOKED UP AT ME AND DECLARED WE SHOULDN'T PLAY THIS BEFORE BED MY HEART IS GOING SO FAST IT HURTS MY WIFE WAS FEELING ABOUT THE SAME

SO THE GAME DID EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO BUT HE'S RIGHT PROBABLY NOT THE BEST WAY TO WIND DOWN AT NIGHT

AND AS FOR THE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS I PLAY WITH MY SON A LOT MY WIFE OCCASIONALLY JOINS US BUT ME AND HIM HAVE PLAYED HUNDREDS OF GAMES TOGETHER HE'S QUITE GOOD FOR HIS AGE TOO

AS FOR MY LONGEST GAME THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE ADVANCED CIVILIZATION I THINK WE HAD A FEW CLOCK IN AROUND THE HOUR MARK AH TO BE BACK IN COLLEGE WITH TOO MUCH FREE TIME AGAIN
I FINALLY GOT AROUND TO PLAYING SNOW TAILS WAS GOOD FUN I ALWAYS ENJOY RACING GAMES USUALLY ONES RELATED TO REAL WORLD MOTOR RACING I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE THIS IN MY COLLECTION AND ENJOY IT'S UNIQUE MOVEMENT MECHANICS THERE'S SOME INTERESTING PLANNING STRATEGY REQUIRED IT'S A KEEPER

I PLAY WITH IMMEDIATE FAMILY ALL THE TIME WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN TO BOARD GAMES AND NOW MORE SO WITH THE HEAVIER STRATEGY MODERN GAMES UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO LIFE WITH TWO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN AND GAMING TIME HAS DROPPED HEAVILY BUT HOPEFULLY IN A FEW MORE YEARS THEY'LL BE ABLE TO JOIN US AND WE CAN RESUME FREQUENT PLAYS

LONGEST GAME I'VE PLAYED AND OWN WOULD BE URBAN SPRAWL EASILY AVERAGING HOURS PER PLAY FUN GAME BUT WHEN PLAYING WITH PLAYERS WAY TOO MUCH DOWNTIME WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAN YOUR NEXT MOVE
QUIET WEEK LAST WEEK

LAS VEGAS FUN DICE CHUCKER VERY SIMPLE GAME WITH SOME INTERESTING DECISIONS

SPLENDOR NOT MY FAVOURITE GAME BUT IT'S VERY POPULAR AND QUITE CHINKY

BIBLIOG I USUALLY WIN THIS GAME WHENEVER I PLAY IT BUT THIS TIME I LOST WINNING NO POINTS

BEYOND BAKER STREET LIKE HANAFI BUT BETTER IT'S GOT MORE THEME AND MORE GAMEPLAY

I ONLY USUALLY PLAY WITH MY FAMILY AROUND CHRISTMAS BUT THEY'RE NOT INTO BOARD GAMES AT LEAST NOT THE MODERN ONES THEY USUALLY PLAY THINGS LIKE TRIVIAL PURSUIT OR FRUSTRATION I MIGHT TRY AND INTRODUCE THEM TO SOMETHING LIGHT AND FUN THIS YEAR

I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO GET INTO LONG GAMES BUT I THINK THE LONGEST I'VE EVER BEEN IN A GAME IS A GAME OF DOMINAE WHICH LASTED NEARLY HOURS


BLOOD RAGE CATAN RUMMIKUB SPLENDOR AND ONITAMA WE JUST GOT BLOOD RAGE AND IT'S BEEN A BLAST CATAN WENT ON A LITTLE LONGER THAN USUAL BECAUSE WE DECIDED TO PICK UP THE PLAYER EXTENSION RUMMIKUB IS OUR NUMBERS GAME FOR THE TIME BEING I THINK WE DECIDED TO SELL RETURN ONITAMA BECAUSE IT JUST WASN'T OUR GAME CHESS PREFERRED
GREAT FEW DAYS OF GAMING BETWEEN THANKSGIVING AND HAVING A COUPLE OF DAYS OFF WE GOT A NUMBER OF PLAYS IN

THROUGH THE AGES A NEW STORY OF CIVILIZATION THIS WAS OUR FIRST PLAYTHROUGH OF THE FULL GAME RATHER THAN THE INTRODUCTORY ERA VARIANT AND I LOVED IT YES THE GAME IS LONG AND NEAR THE END MY SO WAS LOSING SOME STEAM TO BE FAIR WE STARTED AROUND SOMETHING AND WRAPPED UP AROUND BUT IT FLEW BY FOR ME AND WE BOTH REALLY REALLY LIKED THE EXPERIENCE THE DECISIONS IN THIS GAME ARE TOUGH AND EVERYTHING FEELS TIGHT BUT IT NEVER FEELS UNFAIRLY PUNISHING SURE YOU CAN GET SOME HARSH MOMENTS IF YOU RE BEHIND ON MILITARY BUT THAT USUALLY MEANS YOU VE SHIFTED YOUR FOCUS ELSEWHERE AND IT S NOT TOO HARD TO BOUNCE BACK THE GAME IS EXCELLENT AND I SEE WHY IT S 2 ON BG

TERRAFORMING MARS I LIKE THIS GAME BUT I DON T LOVE IT IT S GOT A GREAT THEME AND THE GAMEPLAY ITSELF IS REALLY FUN IN FACT I THINK IT S SUCH A FANTASTIC CONCEPT TO HAVE TWO PLAYERS COMPETING TO HELP A PLANET BECOME TERRAFORMED YOU REALLY GET TO FEEL LIKE YOU VE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING TOGETHER EVEN IF ONE PERSON ULTIMATELY WILL WIN SUM GAME FOR THOSE WHO SAW ARRIVAL MY ISSUE WITH THE GAME IS THE LUCK VIA THE CARDS EVEN IF YOU USE THE DRAFTING VARIANT WHICH WE DID IN THIS GAME FOR EXAMPLE MY SO DECIDED TO ACTIVATE THE BANKER AWARD AS SHE WAS PRETTY FAR AHEAD IN MONEY PRODUCTION THEN LIKE TWO TURNS LATER I GOT A CARD THAT BOOSTED MY MEGACREDIT PRODUCTION STEP FOR EVERY 2 OF THE BROWN CARDS FORGETTING THE NAME WHATEVER YOU SPEND STEEL ON AND I HAD SOMETHING LIKE OF THOSE CARDS UP UNTIL THAT POINT THE BENEFITS OF HAVING SO MANY OF THOSE WAS RELATIVELY MINOR BUT THAT SHOT UP MY MONEY PRODUCTION A TON AND I EASILY STOLE THOSE POINTS FROM HERALDRY IT FELT UNFAIR TO ME ALMOST NO OTHER CARD LATE IN THE GAME HAD THAT KIND OF A SWINGY EFFECT ON OUR SCORES IT FRUSTRATED HER TOO BESIDE THAT HOWEVER I THINK THIS IS A PRETTY NEAT GAME

MACHS VS MINIONS PLAYING THE FOURTH MISSION AGAIN AFTER HAVING FAILED IT WITH A MISUNDERSTANDING OF A KEY RULE THIS TIME WE PLAYED IT RIGHT AND IT WAS MUCH EASIER BUT STILL THE SAME CHAOTIC FUN WE WERE HOPING FOR I LOVE THIS GAME IT S HUGE RIDICULOUS AND A TON OF FUN

IMHOTEP PLAYED THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY SOLID LITTLE GAME I LIKE THE MECHANICS IN THE GAME THOUGH AS SOMEONE WHO PRIMARILY PLAYS 2 PLAYER THIS WILL NEVER ENTER OUR COLLECTION THE DECISIONS ARE TOUGH IN THIS ONE TOO AND I LIKE THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN SCORE OR FORCE YOUR OPPONENTS TO SCORE FEWER POINTS

MEXICA ALSO A FIRST FOR US I REALLY ENJOYED THIS GAME THOUGH THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE COMPANY U MARKBESADA TWO OF US SHIFTED OUR FOCUS FROM STRICTLY WINNING TO DOING ANYTHING WE COULD TO SCREW THE OTHER PERSON OUT OF A FEW POINTS AND IT PLAYED OUT IN THE MOST HILARIOUS WAY POSSIBLE SOMEHOW PULLED AWAY WITH A ONE-POINT VICTORY OVER MY SO THE THIRD NEUTRAL PLAYER WHICH GIVEN THE CRAZY WAY IN WHICH THE GAME UNFOLDED SPEAKS HIGHLY TO THE GAME

SAFRANITO ANOTHER FIRST THIS GAME WAS PRETTY GREAT IT S LIKE SHUFFLEBOARD MEETS A EURO GAME ABOUT CREATING RECIPES NOTHING IN THE GAME IS TOO COMPLEX AND IT LENDS ITSELF TO SOME GREAT LAUGHS

ABOVE AND BELOW I LIKE THIS GAME BUT I DON T LOVE IT I THINK IT HAS SOME DEFINITE NICE FEATURES BUT ULTIMATELY IT FEELS LIKE YOU DON T GET TO DO ENOUGH IN EACH ROUND ESPECIALLY EARLY ON ROUND IS USUALLY COMPRISED OF ADDING A SINGLE NEW COMPONENT TO YOUR BOARD PLAYER OR HOUSE AND MAYBE EXPLORING SURE YOU CAN GET SOME POWERFUL COMBINATIONS WITH SOME OF THE HOUSES BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THEY NEED FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GET THE POWER THAT LETS YOU HIRE GUYS AND MAKE THEM IMMEDIATELY ACTIVE YOU CAN CHAIN TOGETHER WAY MORE TURNS THAN YOUR OPPONENTS STILL THE ART IS GREAT AND THE STORYTELLING IS FUN SO FOR NOW WE RE KEEPING THIS ONE

BONANZA SUCH A GREAT GAME EVERYONE LOOKS DOUBTFUL WHEN WE EXPLAIN THIS GAME BUT EVERYONE SEEMS TO LOVE IT AS SOON AS WE GET INTO THE SECOND OR THIRD ROUND HUGE FAN WONDERING IF THE EXPANSIONS ARE GOOD OR KILL THE SIMPLICITY OF IT

HANAFI A PRETTY SIMPLE GAME BUT ONE THAT LENDS ITSELF TO SOME GREAT TEAMWORK IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PLAYERS WE TYPICALLY WIND UP WITH A PLAYER WHO GIVES TOO MUCH INFORMATION OUT BUT IT S ALL PART OF THE GAME I THINK THIS TIME WE SCORED EXCELLENT NOT TOO SHABBY

DUNGEON PETZ FIRST TIME TRYING THIS WITH MORE THAN 2 AND THE GAME HOLDS UP AS I FULLY EXPECTED IT WOULD IT S GREAT BOTH PLAYER COUNTS EVERY DECISION FEELS TOUGH AND YOU RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO OUTWIT YOUR OPPONENTS WHEN IT COMES TO ASSIGNING YOUR IMPS AND MONEY INTO CLUSTERS THIS IS A SERIOUSLY FANTASTIC GAME

TROYES ANOTHER ONE OF OUR FAVORITES THIS GAME IS JUST SO CLEVER EVEN IF NOW AND THEN THE ACTIONS FEEL LIKE THEY INVOLVE A STEP OR TWO TOO MANY SOMETHING I ULTIMATELY DON T MIND BECAUSE OF HOW REWARDING THE GAMEPLAY IS THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT WAYS TO USE THE DICE AND YOUR WORKERS AND IT CAN FEEL TOUGH AS NAILS THE MIX OF COMPETITIVENESS AND A BIT OF COOPERATION WORKS INCREDIBLY WELL

DAYS THANKS AGAIN TO U MARKBESADA ON THIS ONE WE TRIED THIS YESTERDAY AND ACCIDENTALLY FORGOT ONE OF THE RULES THEREBY ENDING THE WORLD IN A WAR ON BOTH SIDES ENDING IN A TIED LOSS THE SECOND GAME WENT MUCH BETTER AND I BARELY SQUEAKED AWAY WITH A VICTORY AFTER GUESSING WHICH OF THE THREE DEFCON TRACK MY SO HAD PICKED SHE HAD ALL THREE AS HER POTENTIAL AGENDAS AND IF I D PICKED THE WRONG ONE I WOULD HAVE LOST BY CAUSING NUCLEAR WAR AGAIN AWESOME LITTLE STRUGGLE WE LL BUST THIS ONE OUT A LOT I THINK THAT IS UNTIL YOU RE READY FOR IT AGAIN MARK

EDIT FORGOT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY IS MIXED DAD IS RESISTANT TO MOST GAMES BUT MOM IS WILLING TO TRY THEM BUT NOT VERY GOOD AT FOLLOWING EVEN THE SLIGHTEST COMPLEX RULE SET WE'VE GOTTEN THEM HOOKED ON CODENAMES THEY ENJOYED ARUBA AND WE'RE INTRODUCING MORE AND MORE GAMES AS TIME GOES ON

LONGEST GAME IS PROBABLY THROUGH THE AGES BG VINOS DELUXE OR THE ALLERGIST I CAN'T THINK OF MANY OTHERS WE'VE PLAYED THAT WENT SIGNIFICANTLY BEYOND HOURS HOPING TO TRY AN SOMEDAY HOWEVER

GUYS I DID IT I REALLY DID IT IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED I SOMEHOW GOT MY WIFE HOOKED ON BOARD GAMES FOR A WHILE THE ENTIRE LIST OF BOARD GAMES SHE WOULD PLAY WAS MONOPOLY WE WOULD GO TO ANOTHER HOUSE AND PLAY MONOPOLY AFTER A COUPLE OF BRUTAL GAMES I GOT THEM TO PLAY FORBIDDEN DESERT AFTER SOME SUCCESS WITH THAT I PULLED OUT KING OF TOKYO AND HOKKAIDO THEN THE OTHER COUPLE GOT A COPY OF MUNCHKIN I RECENTLY THIS PAST WEEK INTRODUCED THEM TO MACHI BORO BRIGHT LIGHTS BIG CITY AND THEY WERE HOOKED I JUMPED ON THE SUCCESS OF THAT AND PULLED OUT DOMINION AND ALL OF THEM LOVED IT I ALSO TAUGHT MY WIFE CARCASSONNE THIS WEEK AND SHE DIDN'T HATE IT MY WIFE ACTUALLY ASKED ME THIS MORNING IF IT WOULD BE OK IF THE OTHER COUPLE CAME OVER TONIGHT TO PLAY MORE BOARD GAMES IT'S GREAT

SO FOR THIS WEEK I PLAYED IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER
DOMINION
MACHI BORO BRIGHT LIGHTS BIG CITY
HOKKAIDO
KING OF TOKYO
KING OF NEW YORK
MUNCHKIN
CARCASSONNE


SO TO ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION MY WIFE IS NO LONGER A RELUCTANT PLAYER WE'VE PLAYED BOARD GAMES ALMOST EVERY DAY OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND

AS FOR THE LONGEST GAME IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A HOUR GAME OF PLAYER RISK
MARKHAM HORROR CG CORE CAMPAIGN ONE TIME AS A TWO PLAYER WITH MY WIFE CURSE OF THE ROUGAROU STANDALONE ONCE AS A TWO PLAYER WITH A FRIEND AND ONCE SOLO THIS GAME HAS SERIOUS SOLO ACRED

TIDES OF MADNESS TWICE AS A TIME FILLER

SIX PLAYERS SUSHI GO PARTY THREE OR FOUR GAMES

WONDERS DUEL PANTHEON EXPANSION ONE AND A HALF TIMES THAT FIRST HALF WAS BOTCHED BECAUSE WE MISSED A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF THE NEW RULES AND HAD TO START IT OVER

IT WAS A GOOD LONG WEEKEND OF BOARDGAMING
PANDEMIC LEGACY BEAT JANUARY AND FEBRUARY LOST MARCH

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF GOT THIS TO PLAY WITH THE EXTENDED FAMILY OVER THE HOLIDAY AND IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS PICKED UP DAYBREAK WHEN IT WAS ON SALE AT AMAZON YESTERDAY SO WE WILL BE PLAYING EVEN CRAZIER GAMES OF THIS DURING CHRISTMAS

JAIPUR PLAYED A QUICK GAME WHILE WAITING FOR RELATIVES TO SHOW UP AT OUR PLACE WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY GET TO FINISH OUR GAME AS WE WERE AT WHEN THE FAMILY ARRIVED

TICKET TO RIDE EUROPE GOT A TOUCH MORE MEATIER THAN ONUS WITH THE FAMILY IT WAS CUTTHROAT AND WE ALL HAD A GREAT TIME


I PLAY WITH MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY ALL THE TIME MY SO IS ALWAYS WILLING TO PLAY THE KIDS CAN BE HIT-OR-MISS DEPENDING UPON THE GAME BUT PANDEMIC LEGACY HAS EVERYONE ITCHING TO GET DINNER DONE AND THE TABLE CLEANED SO WE CAN START PLAYING


MY LONGEST GAME HAS TO BE AXIS ALLIES BACK IN THE DAY MORE RECENTLY THROUGH THE AGES WAS A LONG GAME THAT FORCED ME TO REEVALUATE WHAT GAMES I PURCHASED TO PLAY WITH MY SO SHE FADES APPROACHING TWO HOURS AND THEN SHE GETS FRUSTRATED BY HER SUBOPTIMAL PLAY
CODENAMES P FILET I PLAYED THIS WITH A PRINT AND PLAY VERSION BECAUSE THE ACTUAL GAME WASN'T COMING TILL FRIDAY WHILE IT WASN'T PRETTY I STILL HAD FUN AND EVERYONE THAT PLAYED SAID THEY LIKED IT THEN ON FRIDAY WE PLAYED WITH SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE AND SOME NEW GREAT FUN ALL AROUND

DOMINION I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THIS ONE I LOVE DOMINION BUT CAN SEE WHY PEOPLE THINK IT'S A BIT DRY AND BORING SO I PLAYED THIS ONE WITH SIBLINGS THAT HAVE NEVER PLAYED AND THEY LIKED IT A LOT A COUPLE OF THEM EVEN SAID THEY'RE GOING TO BUY IT SO THEY CAN PLAY AT HOME

I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE LONGEST GAME I'VE PLAYED IS BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT WAS A RIDICULOUSLY LONG GAME OF MONOPOLY WITH PEOPLE

ASIDE FROM THAT I'VE FOUND OUT THAT I'M KIND OF ADDICTED TO BOARD GAMES I GOT WONDERS THE SAME DAY CODENAMES CAME IN BUT DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY OVER THE WEEKEND NOW I'M LOOKING TO BACK ABANDON PLANET AND ASK FOR EL GRANDE FOR MY BIRTHDAY ALSO IT'S REALLY JUST A PIPE DREAM BUT I'D LOVE KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SOMEDAY BUT FOR NOW I'M SETTLING FOR RUN-THROUGH ON YOUTUBE
OUR WEEKLY SUNDAY GAME DAY CONSISTED OF KINGDOM BUILDER FIRST TIME AND PLAYED TWICE SUISEI GO TWICE BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL ONCE AND THE HARE AND TORTOISE ONCE

IT WAS CANTDOG ON FRIDAY WHICH OF COURSE IS THE ANNUAL FRIDAY AFTER THANKSGIVING DAY OF GAMING

IT STARTED OUT WITH AN LAYER EPIC SIZED GAME OF COMMANDS AND COLORS ANCIENTS RAPHIA SCENARIO MY PERFECT PLAN WAS BOTCHED BY MY SUBORDINATES

THEN I MANAGED TO PULL OFF THE RARE LOSS AS THE ALLIES IN THE COLUMBIA GAMES CLASSIC NAPOLEON

AFTER A VERY QUICK LOSS AT FLINK WE GOT FOLKS TOGETHER FOR GAMES OF LIFEBOATS AND CA H N GUN I DIED HORRIBLY IN BOTH GAMES

AFTER THAT WAS A NICE GAME OF THE END OF THE TRIUMVIRATE WHICH HIT THE TABLE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CLOSE TO A DECADE I GUESS IT NEEDS MORE PLAY I LOST THE EVENING ENDED WITH A FUN GAME OF FUJI FLUSH I LOST

THIS WEEK

THE VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO

OCEANO

CONCORDIA

DIXIT

HAPPY SALMON

ACQUIRE

SPLENDOR

LONGEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED IS PROBABLY SOME HUGE HAIRBALL CONFLICT GAME FROM WHEN I WAS IN THE KID IN THE EITHER DIPLOMACY SAMURAI SWORDS RISK TITAN OR MOST LIKELY AVALON HILL'S THIRD REICH I'VE HAD SESSIONS OF ALL OF THE ABOVE
PLAYED ELDRITCH HORROR THIS WEEK FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE LOST

WHAT WE GOT WRONG

INVESTIGATORS COULD TAKE 2 MOVE ACTIONS
IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME WE DID NOT REALIZE YOU HAD TO PULL AN INVESTIGATION CARD TO GAIN THE CLUE TOKEN PEOPLE JUST TOOK THEM
WE MISSED ALMOST ALL THE COMET TRIGGERS ON THE MONSTER TOKENS
DURING THE FIRST HALF WE LOWERED THE DOOM TOKEN FOR EVERY OPEN GATE EVERY SINGLE MYTHOS PHASE

WE PLAYED WITH PLAYERS AND IT TOOK ABOUT HOURS TO COMPLETE THE GAME MOST EVERYONE STILL HAD AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE ONE PERSON THOUGHT THE DIE ROLLING MADE IT TO RANDOM AND THE DELAY CONDITION NEXT TIME WE PLAY I'M GOING TO ADD SOME HOUSE RULES TO MAKE IT LESS RANDOM AND PUNISHING

CASTLES OF BURGUNDY HAD IT ON THE SHELF FOR A WHILE DIDN'T BRING IT OUT BECAUSE MY GROUP IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW TO EUROS PLAYED WITH THE MORE EXPERIENCED YESTERDAY AND FOUND THE FIRST FEW ROUNDS CONFUSING BUT WE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND IT WHEN WE REACHED PHASE B COUNTY WILL DEFINITELY TRY IT OUT AGAIN THIS WEEK

PANDEMIC PULLED IT OUT ON THANKSGIVING AND INTRODUCED IT TO TWO BEGINNERS MY OTHER EXPERIENCED FRIEND AND I QUARTERBACKED THE FIRST FEW ROUNDS BUT IT ONLY TOOK A WHILE FOR THE TWO NEWCOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THE GAME

CODENAMES CLASSIC GAME ON THANKSGIVING I HAD AN YR OLD ON MY TEAM FRIEND'S COUSIN AND IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO COME UP WITH A HINT THAT SHE CAN UNDERSTAND LOST BOTH GAMES
ONE DAY THIS WEEKEND WE PLAYED TWO GAMES OF TITAN FOLLOWED BY TWO GAMES OF ARKWRIGHT WHICH AT THE TIME DIDN'T SEEM QUITE AS RIDICULOUS AS IT DOES NOW ACTUALLY NOW THAT I'VE FINALLY PLAYED ARKWRIGHT IT SEEMS MUCH MORE APPROACHABLE THAN THE RULES MADE IT SEEM I'M PRETTY SURE I COULD TEACH IT IN MINUTES

WE ALSO PLAYED BAMBOLEO AT THANKSGIVING WITH A LOT OF BOY DO LITTLE KIDS LOVE A GAME WHERE THINGS COME CRASHING DOWN WE PLAYED BOUTERIA TOO OUR HOSTS WERE MEXICAN WHICH ISN'T MUCH OF A GAME UNLESS YOU'RE A LITTLE KID OR YOU DON'T KNOW SPANISH WHICH IS TO SAY IT WAS QUITE A GAME FOR MOST OF US

A BUNCH OF GAMES OF ARBORETUM AND KALIKOW A GAME I DRAGGED OUT BECAUSE I JUST FOUND A COPY SELLING ON EBAY FOR AND THOUGHT DAMN I HAVE THAT KALIKOW IS JUST AS GOOD AND JUST AS BAD AS I REMEMBERED THERE'S A LOT OF LUCK OF THE DRAW A LOT OF HOPELESS SEARCHING FOR OPPORTUNITIES AND A GOOD PLAYER WILL SKUNK A BAD ONE ARBORETUM SEEMS TO FAVOR THE PLAYER WHO DRAWS ALL THE THOUGH I SUSPECT THAT THE FACT THAT I WAS A HEAD FOUR GAMES TO ZERO AT THE END INDICATES THAT FAILING TO PLAY DEFENSIVELY IS NOT A VERY GOOD IDEA

AND OF COURSE A FEAST FOR ODIN THOUGH THERE'S AN ASTERISK NEXT TO MY VICTORY BECAUSE I MISINTERPRETED AN OCCUPATION CARD IT'S NOT COLLECT SILVER IF YOU HAVE A LONGBOAT IT'S YOU MAY SELL A LONGBOAT FOR SILVER

I DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY THE ONES WHO ARE STILL ALIVE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY FROM ME AND WE SEEM TO LIKE IT THAT WAY BUT I'VE CERTAINLY PLAYED A LOT OF GAMES WITH THEM OVER THE DECADES I PLAYED HISTORY OF THE WORLD WITH MY MOM AND AUNT FOR INSTANCE AND ACQUIRE WAS A STAPLE IN OUR FAMILY

THE LONGEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED AT A SINGLE SITTING WAS PROBABLY EITHER CIVILIZATION OR BOTH TOOK MORE THAN HOURS I ALSO SPENT MUCH OF A SUMMER PLAYING THE FULL GAME OF TERRIBLE SWIFT SWORD WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL THOUGH THE GAME GOT SHUNTED TO THE SIDE WHEN AGAINST ALL EXPECTATION I GOT A GIRLFRIEND
AS EXPECTED CARCASSONNE WINTER EDITION CAME OUT AT THE THANKSGIVING TABLE I ALSO TURNED MY RELATIVES ONTO TICKET TO RIDE BY WAY OF THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION I PLAYED A COUPLE OF QUICK GAMES OF DIMMET AND MET WITH SOME OLD FRIENDS FOR A GAME OF PANDEMIC RISE OF CTHULHU OVERALL NOT A BAD FEW DAYS THIS WEEK I HOPE TO PLAY ARBORETUM ONCE IT COMES IN THE MAIL

AS FOR THE QUESTIONS I DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH CONTACT WITH MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY EVEN AROUND THE HOLIDAYS SO IT'S MOSTLY BEEN MY FAMILY THAT WE SEE ON THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS THEY'RE MOSTLY A GROUP SO IT'S BEEN INTERESTING SHOWING THEM OTHER THINGS THEY'RE PRETTY OPEN TO THE EXPERIENCE AND HAVE ADDED SOME OF THE GAMES I DEMODE TO THEIR REGULAR FAMILY GATHERING ROTATION

THE LONGEST GAME I PLAYED WAS AN ALL-DAY RUN OF TALISMAN ONE FOURTH OF JULY THANKFULLY WE WERE ALL PRETTY SAUCED AND IT WAS MOSTLY A SOCIAL GATHERING SO IT DIDN'T DRAG AS MUCH AS IT COULD HAVE IT STILL LASTED THE BETTER PART OF HOURS THOUGH
STARTED A NEW GAME OF PANDEMIC LEGACY WITH MY GIRLFRIEND I'VE PLAYED THROUGH ONCE BUT I GOT A CHEAP COPY FROM MM A FEW WEEKS AGO AND SHE WANTED TO PLAY PLAYED THE FIRST MONTH AND SHE ALMOST CRIED WHEN I TOLD HER TO TEAR UP A CARD IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD TIME
FOR THOSE WHO CELEBRATED I HOPE YOU HAD A NICE THANKSGIVING


I PLAYED WITH MY BROTHER AND SO AFTER WE FILLED UP ON FOOD

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM PLAYERS SEEMED APPROPRIATE TO TALK ABOUT CHICKENS APPLE CHEESE AND BREAD AFTER DINNER THIS WAS ACTUALLY AN INTRODUCTION TO MY SO AND BROTHER SO I WAS THE ONLY LIAR AT THE BEGINNING BUT THEY QUICKLY GOT THE HANG OF IT AND SUDDENLY GOT CONTRABAND MY BROTHER ALSO BECAUSE LORD OF CHEESE BECAUSE HE HAD OF THEM OR SOMETHING INSANE



PLAYERS WE TRIED OUT A KICKSTARTED GAME THAT CAME IN RECENTLY THE IDEA IS THE DEALER KNOWS THE WINNING CONDITION OF THE GAME HIGHEST NUMBER IN PLAY OR LOWEST NUMBER IN YOUR HAND ETC SO THE REST OF US HAVE TO WATCH WHAT CARDS GET PLAYED TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WINNING CONDITION IS VERY LIGHT GAME BUT STILL INTERESTING FOR ONLY LIKE CARDS OR SO I CAN SEE THIS BEING PLAYED IN THE FUTURE AT A DINNER TABLE WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR FOOD OR SOMETHING


FLASH POINT PLAYERS ENDED THE NIGHT WITH A CO-OP GAME TO WIN WE ONLY NEEDED TO SAVE SEVEN PEOPLE BEFORE THE HOUSE BURNED DOWN SO MY BROTHER WAS READY TO CALL IT QUITS AFTER WE SAVED THE SEVEN BUT I KNEW THERE WAS STILL A DOG LEFT IN THE HOUSE SO I INSISTED THAT WE PLAYED UNTIL WE AT LEAST SAVE THE DOG THE DOG ENDED UP BEING THE LAST TOKEN WE TURNED OVER AND WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE HIM JUST IN TIME BEFORE THE HOUSE WAS STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND VICTORY





MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY LIVE OUT OF TOWN BUT I TRY TO BRING SOME GAMES WITH ME WHEN WE DO MEET UP MY BROTHER WAS THE PERSON WHO FULLY INTRODUCED ME TO BOARD GAMES AND WAS IN THE HOBBY WAY BEFORE I WAS SO HE'S DEFINITELY DOWN TO PLAY WHENEVER MY PARENTS HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH SO IT'S HARDER TO FIND A GAME FOR THEM BUT WE STILL MAKE IT WORK I'M HAPPY TO ALSO PLAY THE LIGHTER GAMES WITH THEM LIKE PHASE


THE LONGEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED WAS A PLAYER GAME OF ECLIPSE I THINK WE GOT HOURS IN AND IT WAS ONLY OF THE GAME BUT WE WERE ALL HUNGRY AND WANTED TO GRAB DINNER SO WE JUST RESOLVED EVERYTHING THEN
WEEK OF A BUNCH OF GAMES WAY TOO CLOSE TO THE HOLIDAYS TO BE PICKING UP NEW GAMES BUT THESE WERE ALL I SWEAR

SCYTHE GAME IT WAS ONLY MY 3RD GAME AND THE FIRST WITH MORE THAN REALLY LIKE THE INCREASED TENSION AT I THINK WE'LL BE INCLUDING AN AUTOMA PLAYER FOR OUR GAME MY FRIEND PICKED IT UP PRETTY QUICKLY BUT I WAS TERRIBLE AT TEACHING IT
GREAT WESTERN TRAIL LEARNING GAME AND X I LOVE THIS GAME SO FAR LOADS OF BUILDINGS WENT UP IN THE GAME WHICH MADE UPGRADING YOUR MOVEMENT REALLY IMPORTANT I OF COURSE WENT FOR UPGRADING MY HAND SIZE BEFORE MY MOVEMENT AND MISSED OUT ON MAKING ANOTHER DELIVERY STILL PULLED OUT A WIN THOUGH I THINK I LIKE THIS MORE THAN MOMBASA IT'S MUCH MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EASIER TO TEACH CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS ONE TO DEATH
GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL LEARNING GAME FUN GAME BUT AFTER PLAYING GREAT WESTERN TRAIL I WAS A BIT UNDERWHELMED I THINK IT WILL REALLY OPEN UP ONCE WE PAY MORE ATTENTION TO MAKING COMBOS BUT WE WERE REALLY JUST HITTING BUTTONS TO SEE HOW IT ALL WORKED
ISTANBUL WITH THE MOCHA AND BAKSHEESH EXP I FORGOT HOW MUCH FUN THIS GAME IS IT WAS A NICE SOLID BUT SOMEWHAT FORGETTABLE GAME BUT THE ADDITION OF THE EXPANSION REALLY MAKES THE EXPERIENCE A LOT MORE FUN NEED TO PLAY THIS MORE OFTEN AND KEEP AN EYE ON THE NEWEST EXPANSION
TERRAFORMING MARS GAME WE INTRODUCED THIS TO A FRIEND OF OURS AND I SMARTENED UP AND JUST USED THE BASE CORPORATIONS WITH ONE PRODUCTION OF EVERYTHING BUT INCLUDING THE CORPORATE ERA CARDS MUCH EASIER TO TEACH THIS WAY AND MY FRIEND FIGURED IT OUT PRETTY QUICKLY I'M NOWHERE CLOSE TO GETTING BORED OF THIS I THINK IT'S MY TOP GAME OF

I DON'T SEE MY FAMILY TOO OFTEN NO DRAMA JUST DISTANCE BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET MY ONE GROUP OF NIECES AND NEPHEWS INTO BOARD GAMING THEY WENT NUTS FOR TICKET TO RIDE LESS SO FOR CLICK CLACK LUMBERJACK AH BUT JUST WAIT UNTIL THEY START DRINKING AND I'LL BE CAUSING SOME FAMILY DISCORD BY GIVING THEM SURVIVE FOR XMAS THIS YEAR MY OTHER KIDS AREN'T AS KEEN BUT I TRIED HOOKING THEM WITH LORDS OF WATERDEEP AND SMALLSWORD MY ONE NIECE IS A CATAN ADDICT AT YEARS OLD SO THERE'S HOPE FOR HER YET

LONGEST GAME EVER WAS MAGE WARS WE LOVED THAT GAME BUT BASICALLY TURTLED MOST OF THAT MATCH NOT KNOWING THE RULES THAT WELL MADE IT A HOUR EXPERIENCE GREAT GAME BUT THE TIME COMMITMENT TO LEARN IT WELL ENOUGH TO SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTEN THE GAME TIME WAS TOO HIGH FOR ME AND I TRADED IT AWAY
I PLAYED GAMES OF GREAT WESTERN TRAIL WOW THIS GAME LIVES UP TO THE HYPE I NEED TO PLAY IT AGAIN SOON IT'S ONE OF THOSE GAMES THAT HAS YOU THINKING STRATEGY HOURS LATER
MOST OF THE TIMES IT IS JUST MY WIFE AND I PLAYING HER BROTHER LIVES WITH US BUT WILL GENERALLY RUIN GAMES FOR ME BY NOT LISTENING TO RULES OR JUST DOING WHAT HE WANTS SO I'VE STOPPED INVITING HIM TO PLAY ANYTHING

WE HAD AN MARKHAM HORROR GAME RUN A COUPLE OF DAYS MOSTLY DUE TO CHILDREN NEED CARING FOR



MANSIONS OF MADNESS WE'VE PLAYED THIS GAME TIMES NOW AND HAVE YET TO BEAT ANY CAMPAIGN

TERRA MYSTIC FIRST PLAY THROUGH GAMES EXCELLENT SHOT STRAIGHT TO THE TOP OF MY LIST

MACHI BORO GREAT EASY GAME FOR PEOPLE TO PLAY

TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL WIFE GOT ME KILLED BY EXPLORING INSTEAD OF FIGHTING THE MONSTERS WE ALREADY HAD FIRST RUN THROUGH DIED TILES IN

TINY EPIC GALAXIES THIS GAME WAS MORE COMPLEX THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE REALLY GOT THE WHEELS TURNING AND LOVED IT WENT AHEAD AND KICKSTARTED TINY EPIC QUEST

EXPLODING KITTENS HAD FRIENDS OVER WITH THEIR KIDS EVERYONE HAD A GREAT TIME


SPLENDOR EVERY FRIEND FAMILY MEMBER I'VE GOTTEN TO PLAY IT THEY USUALLY TURN AROUND AND BUY IT THESE ARE USUALLY PEOPLE WHO DON'T REALLY PLAY BOARD GAMES YOU'D BE SURPRISED OR MAYBE NOT AS TO HOW PEOPLE ARE TURNED OFF BECAUSE THEY STEREOTYPE THE BOX ART AND LABEL IT NERDY MY FAMILY IS CLOSED-MINDED QUITE A BIT

ONCE WE PLAY IT AND THEY GET IT WE'LL PLAY AT LEAST TWO MORE ROUNDS USUALLY THERE WILL BE ONE OF THE OTHER THREE PLAYERS WHO WANTS TO PLAY IT EVEN MORE I'M USUALLY DOWN FOR THAT
PATCHWORK PLAYED THIS SOME MORE WITH MY FIANCEE AND EACH TIME I APPRECIATE THE DESIGN A LITTLE MORE SHE IS GREAT A TERRIS AND THEREFORE TENDS TO CRUSH ME HERE BUT OUR SCORES ARE NOW CONSISTENTLY IN THE POSITIVE LAST GAME SHE BEAT ME TO

WONDERS THIS GAME WAS ONE OF MY FIRST PURCHASES A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK BUT HAS SAT MOSTLY UNPLAYED UNTIL THIS PAST WEEKEND HOWEVER I HAD A REALIZATION THAT THE DUMMY PLAYER IN GAMES IS ACTUALLY QUITE BRILLIANT MY FIANCEE TURNED THE DUMMY INTO A MONEY-MAKING MACHINE AND ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED ME IN TWO STRAIGHT GAMES

PANDEMIC ANOTHER POPULAR GAME THAT NEVER GRABBED ME THIS TIME I PLAYED WITH EXPERIENCED PEOPLE AT A PUB ON THE HEROIC DIFFICULTY EPIDEMIC CARDS WE LOST THE FIRST GAME AFTER CURING DISEASES AS WE GOT LIKE CONSECUTIVE YELLOW CARDS WHICH TRIGGERED OUTBREAKS IN OUR SECOND GAME WE WON ON THE VERY LAST TURN THERE WERE NO MORE PLAYER CARDS TO DRAW I'D LIKE TO MESS AROUND WITH THE EXPANSIONS AND EVENTUALLY GET PANDEMIC LEGACY

I PLAY ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WITH MY FIANCEE BUT WE TRY TO GET THE REST OF OUR FAMILY INTO IT TICKET TO RIDE CODENAMES AND SPLENDOR ARE ABOUT AS A HEAVY AS THEY'LL GET BUT THAT'S OK

I RECENTLY PLAYED AN AGONIZING HOUR GAME OF MUNCHKIN AND I WILL PROBABLY NEVER PLAY THAT GAME AGAIN THE CARDS JUST HAPPENED TO SPACE OUT SO THAT EVERYONE WAS AT LEVEL FOR A SOLID HOURS I ONLY WON BECAUSE I PULLED A DIVINE INTERVENTION CARD AS A CLERIC WHICH IS ONE OF THE FEW CARDS THAT ACTUALLY DOES GET YOU TO LEVEL

MUNCHKIN IS THE GAME EQUIVALENT OF AN AMERICAN IDOL STAR THAT DOESN'T REALIZE HIS MINUTES OF FAME HAVE BEEN OVER FOR YEARS IT REALLY LEFT A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH
GOT A GOOD AMOUNT OF GAMING IN THIS WEEK CULMINATING AT FRIENDSGIVING WHERE WE PLAYED PRACTICALLY ALL DAY

EMET PLAYED AT A LOCAL NEETUP MY BUDDY SCORED A GRAND TOTAL OF POINTS AND WE WERE PLAYING THE SHORT GAME PTS TEACHING THE GAME AND PLAYING FOR THE FIRST TIME WENT WELL THE GAME IS QUITE ACCESSIBLE AND INTUITIVE IT'S A KEEPER

HEY THAT'S MY FISH CUTE FILLER WITH ROOM FOR AGGRESSIVE COUNTER PLAY BUT I THINK THE MAYFAIR BOX IS TOO LARGE NO REAL NEGATIVES FOR ME IT'S A NICE LIGHT ABSTRACT

MODERN ART THIS GAME IS EDGING OUT RA FOR MY FAVORITE KNIAZI AUCTION GAME AND I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH THE GROUP WE WOULD DO OUR BEST IRA GLASS IMPRESSION AND MAKE LITTLE SPEECHES SOMETIMES LEWD ABOUT EACH PAINTING WE WERE PAWNING OFFICIAL

FAIRY TALE WITH A BIT MORE BITE I LOVE THE FANTASY THEME AND ANIME ART STYLE

SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE OH MAN WE MUCKED THIS UP SO BAD WE GOT THE COMPLETELY WRONG SUSPECT AND WE FOLLOWED THREE TIMES AS MANY LEADS AS HOLMES IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CASE 2

SPACE ALERT WE PICKED THIS UP RIGHT AT THE END WE FOUND A GROOVE AS A GROUP AND WE'RE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE TUTORIAL MISSIONS WELL I'LL BE ADDING THE INTERNAL THREAT TRACK IN OUR NEXT SESSION

HANAFI GOT HEATED ON THIS ONE
SMALL WORLD PLAYERS FIRST TIME PLAYING WITH BE NOT AFRAID SO I SHUFFLED THE REGULAR RACES AND POWERS AND THEN SHUFFLED TO FORCE THE NEW STUFF INTO THE TOP SPOTS I DOMINATED THE EARLY GAME WITH MECHANT BARBARIANS AND POINTS FOR TURNS 2 AND THE OTHER TWO CAME BACK A BIT BUT I THINK THE GAME ENDED AT SOMETHING LIKE IN MY FAVOR
RESISTANCE GAMES I THINK WITH PLAYERS EACH FIRST TIME PLAYING SINCE PICKING UP HIDDEN AGENDA SO WE USED THE COMMANDER AND ASSASSIN IN THE FIRST TWO GAMES AND BLIND DEFECTORS IN THE THIRD
MACHS VS MINIONS PLAYED WITH ONLY HALF OF OUR NORMAL CREW SO WE DID A CUSTOM SCENARIO WE SET UP THE 1ST MISSION BUT WITH THREE RANDOM TILES IN A LINE INSTEAD OF JUST THE TWO PLAYERS HALF BEING BRAND NEW TO THE GAME THE GAME TOOK FOREVER BECAUSE ONE OF THE PLAYERS DECIDED HE WANTED TO HANDLE MOVING THE BOMB BUT TOOK ABOUT A DOZEN TURNS TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL
PATHFINDER ADVENTURE CARD GAME WRATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS SWORD OF VALOR SCENARIO WE STARTED WITH A REALLY SCARY FIRST TURN OUR ALAIN CAVALIER IMMEDIATELY ENCOUNTERED THE VILLAIN STAUNTON CHANE AND THEN IMMEDIATELY WENT FOR THE CHECK TO DEFEAT BEFORE WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT HELPING OUT THINGS WENT POORLY HAD TO MAKE LIBERAL USE OF ABILITY TO AVOID THE SUCCUBUS TOO BUT WE MADE IT THROUGH IN THE END MY LEONI PICKED UP A DISMISSAL SPELL SO THAT WAS PRETTY AWESOME
SECRET HITLER GAMES FIRST HAD PLAYERS BUT SOMEONE WAS TOO DRUNK TO KEEP GOING AND LEFT HALFWAY THROUGH SECOND AND THIRD WERE BACK TO I WAS A FACIEST THE FIRST GAME AND A LIBERAL THE SECOND AND THIRD FIRST GAME ENDED IN MY FAVOR WITH HITLER GETTING ELECTED SECOND GAME WE FIGURED OUT A FEW LIBERALS VERY QUICKLY AND JUST REJECTED ONE WHOLE SIDE OF THE TABLE LEADING TO A LIBERAL WIN THIRD GAME WAS SIMILAR BUT OUR CONFIRMED LIBERALS INCLUDED ONE FASCIST WE STILL MANAGED TO WIN BECAUSE WE DREW THE ONE LIBERAL POLICY IN THE REMAINING CARDS
UNDER MY BED 2 GAMES AND THEN PLAYERS I WON THE FIRST AS THE KID SECOND GAME DRAGGED ON A BIT DRAGGED ON MEANING LIKE MINUTES TOTAL BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE TOO TIRED TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING KID WON THAT ONE TOO BOTH TIMES IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL GUESS AT WHAT WAS UNDER THE BED
DEAD LAST GAMES WITH PLAYERS VERY FUN MY FAVORITE PART WAS USING CLUES THAT I KNEW ONLY A FEW PEOPLE WOULD GET WHEN I MENTION SERA WHAT COLOR DO YOU THINK OF WHAT COLOR IS A WARCRAFT DARK SKIN

FOR THE QUESTIONS

I PLAY MORE OFTEN WITH MY SIBLINGS THAN WITH ANYONE ELSE MY PARENTS AND MOST OF MY SIBLINGS LIVE MINUTES AWAY FROM ME SO I HEAD OVER THERE EVERY WEEK OR TWO IT HELPS THAT THERE ARE A BUNCH OF THEM LIVING WITH MY PARENTS RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE ALL INTO GAMING OF SOME FORM OR ANOTHER
MAGE KNIGHT BOTH IN TERMS OF PLAY TIME AND IN TERMS OF TIME BETWEEN START AND IT SPLIT UP OVER THE COURSE OF A WEEK
MY GROUP WAS DOWN A BODY SO WE TRIED OUT SOME NEW GAMES THIS WEEK

PLAYED SMASH UP CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG AND MANSIONS OF MADNESS

NOW IT WAS THE FIRST TIME PLAIN MANSIONS AND THE INTRO MISSION SAID IT WOULD TAKE MINUTES SOMEHOW WE STARTED AT AND IT LASTED TO

WE WEREN'T REALLY DELAYING OUR TURNS OR ANYTHING BUT SOMEHOW IT LASTED FOR A LONG TIME BUT IT WAS A VERY ENGAGING COOPERATIVE GAME AND WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO KEEP TRYING THE OTHER SCENARIOS AND EXPANSIONS
PANDEMIC MY AUNT IS AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND PLAYS THIS GAME SOLO EVERY DAY SHE NATURALLY BROUGHT IT TO THANKSGIVING AND IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I PLAYED IT SO I JOINED HERALDRY SHE'S SO SWEET AND FUN THAT YOU ALMOST MISS HOW HARD SHE QUARTERBACKS THAT GAME BUT WE HAD FUN AND WON WITH NONYL 2 RESEARCH CENTERS ON THE BOARD AND MY LITTLE SISTER AS SCIENTIST CURED OF THE DISEASES WHICH MADE HER FEEL GOOD FUN GAME I WANT TO TRY THE CTHULHU VARIANT

CONCORDIA I INTRODUCED THAT SAME AUNT AS WELL AS MY OLDER BROTHER AND MY OLDEST BROTHER-IN-LAW TO CONCORDIA MY SECOND TIME PLAYING THE GAME WENT A BIT SLOW AS EVERYONE TRIED TO WRAP THEIR HEADS AROUND IT THE ONLY REAL WEAKNESS IS NO CLEAR LONG-TERM GOAL IMO BUT WE HAD A GREAT TIME AND ALL AGREED IT WAS FUN NOT KNOWING WHO WAS REALLY WINNING UNTIL THE SCORING ROUND AT THE END MY AUNT WON BY A HUGE MARGIN AND I LOST BY A SIMILARLY HUGE MARGIN PAINTED MYSELF INTO A CORNER EARLY ON WITH COLONIES IN BRITTANIA AND TOO MUCH FOCUS ON CARD BUYING GOOD TIMES

SPLENDOR EASILY THE MOST PLAYED GAME OVER THIS WEEKEND I'M A LITTLE BURNT OUT ON IT NOW THE PUZZLE NEVER GETS OLD AND I LOVE TEACHING THIS TO NEW PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS ENJOY THE HELL OUT OF IT BUT IT'S TIME FOR A NEW GATEWAY GAME SOON

WONDERS DUEL PLAYED WITH MY BROTHER IN LAW I WALKED AWAY WITH TWICE THE VICTORY POINTS AND FELT BAD BECAUSE IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME PLAYING IT BUT HE ADMITTED HE WAS FOCUSING ON THE SCIENCE AND MILITARY CARDS WHILE I GOT ALL THE GUILDS AND WONDERS WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE THIS GAME IS A BLAST BUT IS ALWAYS OVER BEFORE I FEEL LIKE I'VE REALLY TASTED IT GOING TO BUY THE EXPANSION SOON

SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL BROUGHT THIS GAME TO PLAY SOLO AT MY BROTHER'S HOUSE BECAUSE I ANTICIPATED HAVING NOTHING TO DO BUT REDDIN AND DRINK COFFEE HE SURPRISED ME BY ASKING IF HE COULD PLAY AND SO DID MY WIFE SHE'S PLAYED WITH ME BEFORE IT TOOK A BIT LONG BECAUSE HE WAS NEW TO THE GAME AND WE DISCUSSED THE HELL OUT OF EVERY STRATEGIC OPTION BUT WE WON THE GAME WITH MARINES ALIVE A GREAT GAME ALWAYS HAPPY TO BREAK IT OUT

LONGEST GAME I'VE PLAYED IS PROBABLY ORIGINAL RISK WHICH I BEGGED FOR AS A YOUNG TEEN AND LOVED ALTHOUGH WE RARELY FINISHED INSTEAD WE'D SET A TIME LIMIT AND TRY TO HAVE THE MAJORITY SCORE BY THEN THIS ANSWER WOULD BE AXIS ALLIES IF WE HAD EVER GOT PAST THE SETUP PHASE
FORBIDDEN DESERT WE LOST MISERABLY

I ALSO WENT TO A MINIATURE CON TOURNAMENT I'VE NEVER PLAYED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BUT IT WAS NICE KEENING PEOPLE PLAY I COULDN'T STAY LONG WATCHING PEOPLE PLAY AS MY SON WANTED TO PLAY AS WELL

THE LONGEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED IN A SINGLE SITTING WAS MY FIRST GAME OF TWILIGHT STRUGGLE WHICH TOOK ABOUT TO HOURS I GENERALLY TRY TO GET OR PLAY GAMES THAT END PRETTY MUCH AROUND THE TO MINUTE MARK OR HAVE AN EASY WAY TO PAUSE THE GAME TO BE PLAYED AT A LATER DATE LIKE BETWEEN ERAS IN TS

I FINALLY GOT TO GO HOME FOR THANKSGIVING BREAK SINCE I LIVE SO FAR FROM HOME AS SUCH I GOT TO PLAY A LOT OF GAMES WITH MY FAMILY


BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL I PICKED UP THE WALK EXPANSION LAST WEEK WHICH I FINALLY GOT TO PLAY ON SATURDAY MYSELF AND THREE OF MY COUSINS ENDED UP PLAYING THROUGH A SCENARIO WHERE WE ARE ALL INTERNS IN A COMPANY LAST MAN STANDING GETS THE JOB THE OLDEST COUSIN PLAYING ENDED UP WINNING CAUSE ALL OF THE REST OF US WENT INSANE WOO

CODENAMES I GOT THE CHANCE TO INTRODUCE MY NUCLEAR FAMILY TO THIS GAME IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET MOM ON THE SAME PAGE BUT WE GOT GOING EVENTUALLY WE PLAYED THREE GAMES WITH MY TEAM WINNING ONCE THERE WERE SEVERAL ROUNDS WHERE I MISSED A WORD ON THE BOARD THAT FIT INTO MY HINT AND WAS ON THE OTHER LIST SO THAT WAS GREAT

CATAN WITH SEAFARERS I ALSO PICKED UP SEAFARERS AND ITS PLAYER EXPANSION LAST WEEK WE PLAYED THREE GAMES OVER THE WEEKEND WITH MY SISTER MOM AND BROTHER WINNING ALL THREE SEEMED TO RUN INTO A PROBLEM WITH US PRODUCING RESOURCES THE MOST LUDICROUS EXAMPLE WAS THE THIRD GAME AT ONE POINT LITERALLY ALL FIVE PLAYERS ONLY HAD SHEEP AND WHEAT AND IN RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS AS WELL NOBODY GOT A SEVEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND WHEN IT DID FINALLY GET ROLLED WE ALL DISCARDED AT LEAST CARDS EACH I DISCARDED

SOME OF MY NUCLEAR FAMILY IS FINE WITH GAMES THOUGH MY MOM TENDS TO START COMPLAINING IF THE GAME SEEMS COMPLEX OR LIKE IT WILL DRAG ON MY EXTENDED FAMILY IS FAIRLY WISHY-WASHY I HAVE TO SHOW THEM THE RIGHT GAME TO GET THEM INTERESTED REGARDLESS I ENJOY PLAYING WITH THEM AS WE TEND TO FIND OURSELVES IN RIDICULOUS SITUATIONS




VAST WITH TTS ON SALE QUITE A FEW OF MY FRIENDS PICKED IT UP SO WE FINALLY GOT TO TRY VAST I PLAYED CAVE I THINK WE ENDED UP MISINTERPRETING A FEW RULES SINCE WE WERE KINDA TIRED GAME ENDED UP SUPER CLOSE I LOST BECAUSE I POINTED OUT TO ANOTHER PLAYER HOW THEY COULD PREVENT ME FROM WINNING THOUGH I'M PRETTY HAPPY I DIDN'T I FEEL LIKE CAVE WINNING ISN'T EXCITING FOR A FIRST GAME DRAGON WON

LOVE LETTER PAGE VISITED MY HOME TOWN AND WAS TO SURPRISED TO SEE MY SISTER WHO TENDS TO DISLIKE BOARDGAMES HAD GOTTEN THIS PLAYED QUITE A LOT OF THIS

COUP MET UP WITH SOME OLD FRIENDS AND WENT TO A BOARD GAME BAR THEY HAVEN'T PLAYED MUCH MODERN GAMES AND THEY WANTED LYING AND BLUFFING SO I SUGGESTED THIS AND IT WAS A HUGE HIT I THINK I WON TWICE

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM SAME GROUP WITH COUP I SUGGESTED IT AFTER WE GOT PLAYED COUP FOR AWHILE SINCE THEY SEEMED TO LIKE THE BLUFFING FELL PRETTY FLAT I STILL DON'T CARE FOR THIS GAME I'M NOT GONNA SUGGEST IT AGAIN I THINK I WON BUT WE DIDN'T REALLY CARE BY THE TIME SCORING CAME AROUND

PATCHWORK FIRST TIME EITHER OF US PLAYED FUN BUT SURPRISINGLY STRESSFUL I WON BY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING AGAIN

TERRA MYSTIC PLAYED AS SWARMLINGS WE MESSED UP A BUNCH OF SCORING THROUGH OUT THE GAME AND SINCE WE WERE ALL WITHIN AT THE END IT REALLY BEEN GAME
PLAYED GAMES WITH MY COUSINS OVER THANKSGIVING AND ONE GAME WITH MY OLDER SISTER IT WAS REALLY FUN AS I'VE MOVED MY COUSINS OUT OF GATEWAY TERRITORY

PUERTO RICO I BROUGHT THIS HOME LAST CHRISTMAS AND PLAYED WITH THREE OF MY COUSINS AND THEY HAD ASKED TO BORROW IT OVERNIGHT SO THEY COULD PLAY IT AGAIN SO I BROUGHT IT BACK BUT ONLY TWO OF THEM WERE AROUND WHEN WE DECIDED TO PLAY IT IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN OUR PREVIOUS GAMES AS I THINK THEY LEARNED THAT BEING THE PERSON THAT PICKS THE CRAFTSMAN FREQUENTLY PUTS YOU AT A DISADVANTAGE I ENDED UP WINNING BY A DECENT MARGIN DUE TO GETTING THE GUILD HALL AND FORTRESS FOR A LOT OF POINTS THIS GAME HAS REALLY STOOD THE TEST OF TIME NOW IF ONLY I COULD AFFORD A COPY OF THE YEAR ANNIVERSARY EDITION

TRICK OF THE RAILS ONE COUSIN LEFT TO GO DEER HUNTING SO MY SISTER JUMPED IT FIRST TIME PLAYING THIS AFTER RECEIVING IT ABOUT A MONTH AGO FROM THE KICKSTARTER THIS GAME IS GREAT AS THE GAME WENT ON I KEPT REALIZING ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH I HAD SCREWED UP AND CONTINUED TO SCREW UP A GREAT FILLER GAME

THE GAME MY SISTER LEFT AND WHILE WE WAITED FOR ANOTHER COUSIN TO SHOW UP THE OLDEST OF MY COUSINS AND I PLAYED A ROUND OF THIS I THINK THIS WAS ONLY THE SECOND TIME WE'VE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF ALL THE CARDS I THINK THE OTHER TIME WAS ALSO WITH 2 PLAYERS HAVING TO CHECK THE RULEBOOK FOR HAND SIZE REALLY SHOWED ME HOW LITTLE GERMAN I REMEMBER

TERRAFORMING MARS PLAYED THIS WITH THE OLDEST AND YOUNGEST OF MY COUSINS AND THE YEAR OLD DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TROUBLE WITH THE GAME A FEW CARDS WERE CONFUSING TO HIM BUT NOTHING THAT KEPT HIM FROM PLAYING THIS WAS MY SECOND TIME PLAYING THE FIRST TIME WITH PLAYERS I DON'T THINK THE PLAYER GAME WAS MUCH SHORTER OVERALL I LOST BY POINT TO MY YEAR OLD COUSIN WITH THE YEAR OLD ABOUT POINTS BEHIND THE YEAR OLD SAID THIS WAS HIS FAVORITE OF ALL THE GAMES HE'S EVER PLAYED

AMONG THE STARS SAME COUSINS AS BEFORE I'VE ONLY PLAYED ONCE BEFORE OVER A YEAR AGO BUT IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THEY HAD BOTH PLAYED A BUNCH OF WONDERS SO DRAFTING WAS PRETTY SIMPLE I RAN AWAY WITH THIS GAME WITH AN ENGINE OF BLUE ROOMS GENERATING A LOT OF POINTS


QUESTIONS

MY YEAR OLD COUSIN GOES TO COLLEGE NEAR WHERE I LIVE SO HE'S A ATTENDEE AT MY GAME DAYS OTHERWISE I MAINLY PLAY WITH MY COUSINS WHEN I'M HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS AS I'VE TURNED SEVERAL OF THEM INTO GAMERS RANGING IN AGE FROM TO GROWING UP I WOULD PLAY CARDS WITH MY GRANDPARENTS AND SOME PARTY GAMES AT HOLIDAYS

LONGEST GAME PROBABLY ABOUT HOURS FOR MAGE KNIGHT OR HOURS FOR THROUGH THE AGES I PLAY A LOT OF HOUR GAMES BUT IT IS HARDER TO GET PEOPLE FOR LONG GAMES
C C ANCIENTS TRIED OUT OUR FIRST GAME FIRST SCENARIO SYRACUSE THUNDERED BACK AFTER A SLOW START AND WON THE GAME BANNERS TO WE GOT SOME OF THE RULES WRONG AT THE START WHEN BATTLING TOOK US NEARLY THE ENTIRE GAME TO REALIZE A FEW CHARTS IS BASICALLY ALL YOU NEED TO PLAY THE GAME TOOK US ABOUT 2 HOURS TO FINISH UP SHOULD BE A MORE ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT BETTER

ARCTIC SCAVENGERS PLAYED A FEW 2 PLAYER GAMES OF THIS WITH A NEW PLAYER I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS GAME RIGHT NOW
PLAYS BEDMATE USER MACURVELLO SUBTYPE BOARDGAME START END

MAGE KNIGHT THE BOARD GAME CONQUER AND HOLD SCENARIO WITH PVP RULES AS ALWAYS IT WAS AWESOME I'VE GOT QUITE A FEW GAMES OF MK UNDER MY BELT BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED WITH PVP AND MAN IT WAS HARD THE RULES ARE SO COMPLICATED AND THE STRATEGY EVEN MORE SO IT WAS TIRING I MUST ADMIT BUT STILL AWESOME FUN AS EVERY MAGE KNIGHT GAME

GHOST STORIES ON IPAD SOLO I ACTUALLY PLAY THIS MANY MANY TIMES EVERY WEEK SOLO EVERY TIME I HAVE TO USE THE POTTY I USUALLY PLAY WITH TWO MONKS GREEN AND YELLOW ON HELL DIFFICULTY CHOOSING THE MONKS ABILITIES AND TILE SETUP IT IS STILL FREAKISHLY HARD I'VE GOT A WIN RATE ON THIS GAME

KEYFLOWER FIRST TIME PLAYING THIS I ENJOYED IT MORE THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD A NICE EURO WITH ORIGINAL MECHANICS BUT OTHER SIMILAR OPTIONS APPEAL MORE TO ME

KANAZAWA ANOTHER GAME I ENJOYED MORE THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD NICE RELAXING GAME WITH BEAUTIFUL ARTICLE I DON'T LIKE SET COLLECTION GAMES USUALLY BUT THIS ONE WAS OKAY THE BAMBOO PLAYMAN IS A COMPLETE JOKE I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING THAT AT LEAST LOOKED LIKE REAL BAMBOO BUT WHAT I GET IS A BEACH MAT FOR LEPRECHAUNS THE MOST ANNOYING THING ABOUT THIS GAME THOUGH IS THAT THERE IS NO FREAKING TIE BREAKER I HATE THE SHARE THE VICTORY SHENANIGAN WHICH SADLY HAD TO HAPPEN

DESCENT JOURNEYS IN THE DARK SECOND EDITION NOT SURE ABOUT THE MISSION SINCE THE OWNER AND OVERLORD WAS THE ONE WHO PREPARED IT IT WAS MY 3RD TIME PLAYING THIS GAME AND ALTHOUGH I TRY REALLY HARD I CAN'T SEEM TO LIKE IT
I PLAYED HERO QUEST WHEN I WAS A KID AND HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF IT SPECIALLY THE EXPLORATION ASPECT OF THE GAME WHICH IS NOT PRESENT IN MOST MODERN DUNGEON CRAWLERS I LOVE FANTASY AND THEMES DOES ANYONE HAVE A SUGGESTION ON AWESOME DUNGEON CRAWLERS WITH EXPLORATION SIMILAR TO HERO QUEST BUT MORE UP TO DATE I CAN TELL YOU SOME I ALREADY KNOW AND OR DON'T LIKE MICE AND MYSTICS THE STORY BOOK KIND OF RUINS THE SURPRISES SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE GOD WHAT AN AWFUL GAME I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT HAVE WATCHED A GAMEPLAY VIDEO LEVEL OMEGA PROTOCOL MANSIONS OF MADNESS 1ST EDITION I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THE 2ND EDITION SINCE IT'S TRUE EXPLORATION WITH NONE OF THE MAP PRE REVEALED
I'VE HEARD YOU CAN PLAY DESCENT 1ST EDITION WITHOUT REVEALING THE MAP BEFOREHAND AND I'M WAITING ON A FRIEND TO BE THE OVERLORD FOR US ONE DAY I'M EXCITED BUT I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE MENTION THE 1ST EDITION THOUGHTS

ATTACK ON TITAN DECKBUILDING GAME THIS WAS AWESOME MORE BECAUSE OF THE GOOFINESS OF MY GROUP WHILE PLAYING IT THAN THE ACTUAL GAME ITSELF HAHA EVERYTIME SOMEONE DID A CARD COMBO OR KILLED A TITAN SOMEONE WOULD START SINGING THE ANIME SONG AND MOVE THE CHARACTER STANDEE AROUND THE TITAN AS IF IT WAS AN EPIC KILL IT TURNED INTO AN INSIDE MEME AND THE SONG WAS IN MY HEAD TILL THE NEXT DAY TONS OF LAUGHS WHILE PLAYING THIS
IT'S A NICE DECK BUILDER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF THEME NOT REALLY A MUST PLAY FOR FANS OF THE ANIME MANGA BUT DEFINITELY ONE I WOULD RECOMMEND

THROUGH THE AGES A NEW STORY OF CIVILIZATION MAN THIS GAME IS AWESOME I PLAYED A COUPLE GAMES ONLINE THIS WEEK AND ALSO ONCE THE PHYSICAL VERSION FOR THE SECOND TIME THIS REVISED EDITION IS SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL PLAYING THE PHYSICAL GAME WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE RECALCULATING MILITARY STRENGTH EVERYTIME SOMETHING CHANGED WAS A BIG PAIN IN THE ASS SO I KIND OF GOT BUMMED DOWN THAT THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT PLAYING IT ONLINE WAS BETTER IT'S STILL AN AWESOME GAME AND I WOULD DEFINITELY PLAY THE PHYSICAL GAME AGAIN BUT HANDLING THE CONTROL OF THE NUMBERS OVER TO A MACHINE IS REALLY RELEVANT IN THIS GAME MAYBE IT WORKS BETTER IN THE PEACEFUL VARIANT

CLANK SECOND TIME PLAYING THIS AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY AWESOME IT'S NOT GETTING TOO MUCH HYPE ADAMIK BUT IT CERTAINLY SHOULD THE THRILL OF THE RACE AND OF THE HOPE THAT YOUR CUBES DON'T COME OUT OF THE BAG AND INSTEAD YOUR OPPONENTS DO IS SO AWESOME VERY EXCITING AND FUN

CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD A TWEAKED LORDS OF WATERDEEP KINDA I LOVE WORKER PLACEMENT AND THIS WAS NO DIFFERENT NOTHING TOO SPECIAL ABOUT IT BUT I THOUGH IT WAS COOL ONLY FIRST TIME PLAYING IT BUT MY IMPRESSION IS THAT SOME LEADERS ARE WAY BETTER THAN OTHERS

FABLED FRUIT WE ONLY PLAYED ONE GAME AND SO IT WAS UNTIL THE 7TH CARD I BELIEVE IT WAS PRETTY MPH IMHO AND I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN IMPROVE MUCH FURTHER EVEN WITH NEW MECHANICS AS YOU GO THROUGH THE DECK OF CARDS IN FURTHER GAMES BUT I DON'T KNOW I COULD BE PROVEN WRONG

EDIT MOST OF THESE WERE PLAYED WITH USER CG WHO ALSO POSTED HIS THOUGHTS HERE IN THIS THREAD
I PLAYED GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL AND IT JUST SO EURO I USUALLY LOVE EUROGAMES BUT THE DOWNTIME WAS INSANE I COULD SPEND MINUTES NOT DOING ANYTHING IF I WAS THE FIRST PLAYER HATED IT FOR THAT REASON WITH PLAYERS IT TOOK NEARLY HOURS THE WORST PART WAS THAT TWO PLAYERS WERE CRUSHING IT THEY HAD PLAYED BEFORE SO AFTER MINUTES THE OTHER TWO WERE SO FAR BEHIND THEY COULDN'T WIN PLAYING A GAME FOR MINUTES THAT YOU CAN'T WIN IS NOT FUN

LONGEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED WAS THE FIRST GAME OF REBELLION BUT I GRABBED IT FOR THAT REASON AS A FRIEND WAS RECOVERING FROM SURGERY
QUADROPOLIS CLOSE GAME PLAYERS I LOST SCYTHE ANOTHER CLOSE PLAYER GAME WHICH I ALSO ENDED UP BEING THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL IN
MAGE KNIGHT TO ME AN EURO COSPLAYING AS AN AMERITRASH AND OVERALL A GREAT GAME PLAYED THE VERY COMPETITIVE MODE OF KING OF THE HILL WHERE YOU HAVE TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE KEEPS AND MAGE TOWERS OF THE MAP FIRST TIME PLAYING WITH THE PVP COMBAT AND WHILE IT CAN BE A BIT CONVOLUTED AT TIMES I DIDN'T DISLIKED IT AS I THOUGHT I WOULD THOUGH UNLESS WE ARE PLAYING A VERY COMPETITIVE MODE I THINK I WOULD RATHER PLAY WITHOUT IT HOURS WENT BY AND WE BARELY NOTICED IT

KEY FLOWER NICE WORKER PLACEMENT THOUGH I CAN'T SAY IT LEFT A HUGE IMPRESSION ON ME I WOULD PLAY IT AGAIN IT HAS AN INTERESTING MECHANIC WHEN IT COMES TO WORKERS WHICH CAN QUICKLY LEAD TO BIG DIFFERENCES OF HOW MANY WORKERS EACH PLAYER HAS IN THE BEGGING OF A ROUND BUT THAT SITUATION CAN JUST AS QUICKLY REVERSE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT HUGE OF AN IMPACT AS YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME THE RANDOMIZED ACTION SPACES YOU DRAW EACH ROUND DURING THE GAME WILL BE JUST A FRACTION OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE SO THERE'S SOME REPLACEABILITY VALUE THERE BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY WERE LEFT OUT TO ME IT LOOSES SOME POINTS FOR BEING A OVERALL SYMMETRIC GAME BUT I DON'T MIND IT THAT MUCH ASYMMETRIC GAMES CAN BE VERY HARD TO PULL OFF CORRECTLY

MYSTIC VALE I LOVE DECK BUILDING SO OBVIOUSLY I WOULD LOVE THIS GAME IT'S CONCEPT IS VERY INTERESTING AND I LOOK FORWARD FOR OTHER GAMERS VENTURING IN IT THOUGH I HAVE TO AGREE WITH A GRIEVANCE BROUGHT UP BY ANOTHER PLAYER THAT THE SPECIAL ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE CARDS OVERALL ARE NOT THAT CREATIVE OR INVENTIVE THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO IT BUT IT'S STILL HAS SOME DIVERSE SPECIAL ACTIONS AND A FEW COOL INTERACTIONS MAINLY CARDS WITH THE GUARDIAN SYMBOL AND IT DOES INVOLVE SOME STRATEGY THINKING ON HOW YOU BUILD YOUR DECK THOUGH THE DRAWING MECHANIC MAKES ME THINK THAT CLEARING CURSED GETTING GROWTH WILL ALWAYS BE A PREMIUM STRATEGY SINCE NO MATTER HOW BAD YOUR DECK IS IF YOU CAN PLAY CARDS WHILE THE OTHERS ONLY YOU'LL PROBABLY COME OUT WINNING

ROAD FUN FILLER FYI I HAVE A VERY LOOSE CONCEPT OF FILLER WITH SOME GOOD FLAVOR TO IT ALWAYS FUN TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS GETTING EATEN BY ZOMBIES OR DOOM THE WHOLE GROUP BY INFLATING THE BID VALUES

LUNA INTERESTING WORKER PLACEMENT I'M NOT SURE I WOULD CALL IT A WORKER PLACEMENT SINCE YOU CAN ONLY PERFORM THE ACTIONS YOUR WORKERS ARE ALREADY ON THERE IS A PRE DETERMINED WORKER PLACEMENT AT THE START OF THE GAME WHICH IS ASYMMETRIC AFTER THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE MEASURES TO MOVE YOUR WORKERS AROUND BEFORE THE NEXT ROUND SO THAT THEY BEGIN THE ROUND AT THE ACTION ISLANDS YOU WISH TO TAKE OR HAVE A BUNCH OF BOATS IT ISN'T AS PLANNING HEAVY AS YOU WOULD THINK AS EVERY ISLAND HAS IT'S USES AND SOME ACTIONS CAN BE PERFORMED ON ANY ISLAND THOUGH THERE ARE SMALL DIFFERENCES DEPENDING ON THE ISLAND YOU ARE PERFORMING IT ON THE BIG STRATEGY PERHAPS COMES WITH THE TEMPLE WHERE YOU HAVE TO CAREFULLY PLACE YOUR WORKERS INSIDE BUT ALSO PROTECT THEM FROM BEING EXPELLED FROM OTHER PEOPLE WORKERS COMING AFTERWARDS

THROUGH THE AGES ANSON AMAZING GAME IT MIGHT BE JUST BETTER OFF ONLINE IT'S A SHAME REALLY DON'T GET ME WRONG IF PEOPLE WANT TO PLAY IT I WILL BUT IT CAN GET MESSY SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY THE MILITARY WHICH CAN COME FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOURCES UNITS ATTICS TECHS WONDERS TERRITORIES LEADERS GOVERNMENTS URBAN BUILDINGS AND PACTS AND SOME TYPES OF SOURCES HAVE MULTIPLE CARDS ADDING TO IT OVERALL I'M SPOILED BY THE FAST EASY AND MISTAKE PROOF ONLINE PLAYING AND AM REALLY HYPED ABOUT THE NEW APP COMING UP THOUGH I STILL DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID I HOPE IT WILL

CLANK LOVE THIS DECK BUILDING GAME STILL TO FIND A DECK BUILDING GAME THAT I DIDN'T ENJOY BUT THIS ONE IS CLOSE TO THE TOP OF MY LIST THOUGH NOT FOR THE DECK BUILDING ITSELF TO ME THE BEST PART OF THIS GAME IS THE NON DECK BUILDING PART OR THE MAIN THING YOU DO WITH YOUR DECK WHICH IS EXPLORING THE DUNGEON AND GATHERING TREASURES OVERALL A GREAT EXPERIENCE THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE AS STRATEGIC AS I WISH IT WAS THERE IS SOME BIG STRATEGIC DECISIONS LIKE WHICH PATH TO TAKE BUT MOST OF THE TIME YOU'LL BE DOING WHAT THE CARDS ALLOW YOU TO DO AND VERY OFTEN THE CHOICES WILL BE PRETTY OBVIOUS BOTH ON WHERE TO MOVE AND WHAT CARDS TO BUY THERE ARE VERY FEW INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE CARDS IN YOUR DECK THERE WERE A FEW MOMENTS WHERE I HAD TO TAKE BIG DECISIONS WHERE I WERE TORN BETWEEN A FEW OPTIONS BUT THEY DIDN'T HAPPEN AS OFTEN

FABLED FRUIT INTERESTING CONCEPT BUT WE ONLY PLAYED ONE GAME AND THE FIRST GAME I MUST SAY IS PRETTY SHALLOW IN STRATEGY BUT DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME THIS IS THE IDEA OF THE GAME IF YOU ARE NOT AWARE THIS GAME IS KINDA LIKE A LEGACY GAME WHERE YOU'LL RUN THOUGH A DECK OF CARDS PROVIDING THE ACTIONS ALLOWED EACH ROUND AND AS YOU PLAY MORE AND MORE GAMES ACTIONS WILL BE REMOVED AND OTHERS WILL BE ADDED ALONG WITH NEW MECHANICS CLOSE TO THE END OF OUR GAME THE MARKET WAS INTRODUCED WE DIDN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO USE IT THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL THERE BUT WITH JUST ONE GAME I JUST COULDN'T GET TO IT NOT SAYING THE FIRST GAME WAS BAD IT WAS FUN AS GOOD AS MOST FILLERS OUT THERE JUST SAYING IT MIGHT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE SOME REAL DEPTH WHICH I DIDN'T GET TO SEE

CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD NICE WORKER PLACEMENT AND WHILE THE OTHER PLAYERS DISAGREED WITH ME ON THIS I STILL FEEL IT KINDS FEELS THE NICHE OF LORDS OR WATERDEEP AND I THINK I PREFER THE LATTER

KANAZAWA FUN AND BEAUTIFUL FILLER WITH SOME INTERESTING CHOICES TO BE MADE THOUGHT THE GAME THOUGH THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS WITH TURN ORDER SINCE TO AVOID WASTING TIME WE DIDN'T WAIT FOR THE PREVIOUS GUY TO FINISH PLACING THEIR PAINTINGS TO THEN KEEP PLAYING THAT LEAD TO SOME IFFY MOMENTS BUT THAT'S OUR FAULT NOT THE


I ENDED UP PLAYING BOARDGAMES DIFFERENT MOMENTS THIS WEEK TWO OF THEM PRETTY BOARD INTENSIVE AND YES I HAVE A PROBLEM AND YES I AM UNEMPLOYED AND CURRENTLY WITH VERY FEW CLASSES STOP JUDGING ME

AS TO THE TWO LAST QUESTIONS I DID TRY PLAYING SOME BOARDGAMES WITH MY FAMILY AND IT WENT WELL MOST TIMES BUT THEY JUST DON'T SEEM THAT INTERESTED AND LONGER GAME MUST BE WITHER CTA OR MAGE KNIGHT THOUGH I THINK THE PRIZE GOES TO THE LATTER WITH A BIT OVER HOURS

EDIT ACTUALLY HAD A GAME OF MAGE KNIGHT WITH THAT LASTED HOURS AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SHORT GAME MODES BUT IT WAS MOSTLY ONE OF THE PLAYERS FAULT
GOT SEVERAL THIS WEEK DUE TO THE HOLIDAYS

DESCENT JOURNEYS IN THE DARK SECOND EDITION WE WERE ABLE TO FINISH THE FIRST CAMPAIGN AND ARE READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT EXPANSION

EVOLUTION CLIMATE INTRODUCED THIS GAME TO SEVERAL PEOPLE THIS WEEK THERE WILL BE PLENTY MORE PLAYS IN THE FUTURE WE LOVE THIS GAME

THE RED DRAGON INN BATTLE FOR GREENPORT WE FINALLY GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY WITH MORE THAN 2 PLAYERS IT'S DEFINITELY BETTER WITH MORE PLAYERS IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME SOLO OR WITH 2 PLAYERS I'D RECOMMEND PLAYING WITH AT LEAST HEROES TOTAL IT'S REALLY MUCH MORE FUN WITH MORE HEROES PLAYERS IT'S CRAZY HARD THOUGH

FATE OF AVALON TRIBES INTRODUCED IT TO A FEW NEW PLAYERS THIS IS A FUN GAME THAT CHANGES THE WAY IT FEELS WITH EACH PLAYER COUNT

BATTLE YAHTZEE DEADPOOL MY BROTHER-IN-LAW GOT THIS GAME AND WANTED TO TRY IT OUT IT'S HORRIBLE HAHA

THE OPULENT WE BACKED THE KS AND GOT THIS GAME A FEW WEEKS AGO BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO LEARN THE GAME UNTIL THE HOLIDAY BREAK THE RULE BOOK IS PRETTY DENSE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY EASY TO LEARN IT'S TOUGH TO GET THE WIN CONDITIONS AS MOST COOPERATIVE GAMES ARE HARD BUT IS FUN AND THEMATIC ALONG THE WAY

PANDEMIC LEGACY SEASON MY GROUP FINALLY COMPLETED THE CAMPAIGN I'M SO HAPPY IT'S OVER WE DID NOT ENJOY THIS GAME I PROBABLY WON'T PLAY A LEGACY GAME EVER AGAIN IT WASN'T HORRIBLE BUT DEFINITELY MPH WAY OVER HYPED IMO

RIFTWALKER A STORM HALLOW CARD GAME WE BACKED THE KS AND GOT A CHANCE TO LEARN PLAY THIS WEEK MY WIFE AND I ARE NOT FANS OF ABSTRACT GAMES AND WE DIDN'T ENJOY IT HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO DOES LIKE ABSTRACT GAMES IT'S GOT A PRETTY FUN CONCEPT TO IT AND ONLY ONE PORTION IS ABSTRACT I DON'T LIKE THAT I DON'T LIKE THIS GAME

TINY EPIC KINGDOMS I BACKED THIS KS TO GET THE PACK AS STOCKING STUFFERS WE KEPT ONE FOR OURSELVES OF COURSE I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME WE INTRODUCED THIS GAME TO A FEW PEOPLE THIS WEEK AND THEY LIKED IT TOO

MY WIFE AND I ARE PROUD TO BE CHILD FREE AND HAVE A TON OF OPPORTUNITY ENJOY THE HOBBY WE TRAVEL THE COUNTRY WORLD TO ATTEND GAMING CONFERENCES AND OTHER TOURISTY STUFF IN THAT SENSE WE DEFINITELY DO SHARE THE SAME INTEREST

WE ALSO PLAY REGULARLY WITH MY PARENTS WE PLAY WITH MY SISTER OCCASIONALLY BUT SHE JUST HAD A BABY AND HAS NOW BECOME REALLY LAME WHEN THE BABY IS AROUND SHE'S STILL AWESOME WHEN SHE ISN'T WITH THE BABY HOWEVER WHEN WE CAN GET MY SISTER AWAY FROM HER BABY SHE ENJOYS PLAYING THOUGH

WHEN I WAS YOUNG I PLAYED A VERY LONG GAME OF RISK WITH MY COUSINS WE PLAYED IT OFF AND ON FOR SEVERAL WEEKS OVER THE COURSE OF A SUMMER I'D GUESS IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT HOURS BUT I HATED EVERY SECOND OF IT

IN RECENT MEMORY THE LONGEST GAME WAS PROBABLY MAGE KNIGHT I PLAYED A SOLO GAME AFTER I FIRST STARTED LEARNING THE GAME IT TOOK ABOUT HOURS BECAUSE I HAD TO REFERENCE THE RULES SO MUCH I DO LIKE THE GAME BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL PLAY IT MUCH ANYMORE OR EVER AGAIN AS I ACTIVELY TRY TO AVOID GAMES THAT LAST MORE THAN ABOUT HOURS

SCUTTLE X A FINE GAME BUT DEFINITELY PRETTY SIMPLE PLAYED WITH ALL THE KICKSTARTER EXPANSIONS NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE DISEASES THEY MAKE THE GAME A BIT TOO MUCH LIKE FLUX

DEFENDERS OF THE REALM TTS X MY FIRST MULTIPLAYER GAME WITH TABLETOP SIMULATOR AND I LIKED IT QUITE A BIT DEFINITELY SOME ISSUES GETTING IN THE SWING OF THINGS BUT WE SUCCESSFULLY PLAYED A FULL GAME

I'M HOPING TO USE TTS TO TEST OUT KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER SO IF ANYONE HAS TIPS OR SUGGESTIONS FOR THAT I'D LOVE TO HEAR THEM



I PLAY GAMES A DECENT AMOUNT WITH THEM AND THEY ARE GENERALLY ENTHUSIASTIC BASED ON THE GAME CODENAMES CAMEL UP CONCEPT ARE ALL GREAT BUT I HAVE TO AVOID BRINGING THINGS LIKE CARCASSONNE AND COSMIC ENCOUNTER BECAUSE OF THE THEME OR ARTICLE

THE LONGEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED WAS A GAME OF DOMINANT SPECIES WITH AN INCREDIBLY AP PERSON PLAYERS LASTED ABOUT OR HOURS WAS PRETTY FUN BUT WAY TOO LONG
SO I AM NEW TO THE HOBBY AND I HAVE A GROUP OF FRIENDS WHO ARE PRETTY KEEN TO TRY GAMES OUT WITH ME I HAVE WHAT I FEEL ARE A NICE MIX OF GATEWAY GAMES

THIS WEEK OR REALLY LAST NIGHT WE PLAYED TRURO TWICE WHICH WENT DOWN AS A PLEASANT LITTLE STRATEGY GAME EVERYONE ENJOYED IT EVERYONE SEEMED HAPPY TO PLAY MORE AFTER WE MOVED ONTO LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN THIS WAS THE MAIN COURSE AND IT WENT DOWN A BLAST WE PLAYED THE FIRST MOVIE AND IT WAS A SUPER TIGHT BATTLE I THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD BUT WE PULLED IT BACK AT THE END SUPER ENGAGING THROUGHOUT EVERYONE LOVED THE GAME OVERALL WE ENDED WITH LORDS OF WATERDEEP AND WHILE EVERYONE ENJOYED THE MECHANICS IT WAS NOTED THAT THE GAME WAS A LITTLE DRY WHICH I WOULD AGREE WITH BUT AM PROBABLY GOING TO GRAB THE EXPANSION FOR TO MAYBE ADD A LITTLE MORE FLAVOUR

OVERALL SOLID NIGHT
WE PLAYED DEEP SEA ADVENTURE LAST NIGHT ONCE WE GOT THE RULES FIGURED OUT IT WAS A PRETTY FUN GAME IT WILL MAKE IT TO THE TABLE AS A FILLER AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE OTHER THAN THAT MY HOUSE HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY POKÉMON SUN AND MOON SO I WAS ON MY OWN FOR GAMES AND PLAYED HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR A FEW TIMES
TERRAFORMING MARS SOLO I LOVE THIS GAME IT'S MY NEW GO TO SOLO GAME I ALSO PLAYED A GAME WITH MY SON HIS FIRST TIME AND HE BEAT ME AS USUAL BY TEN POINTS HE'S JUST SO GOOD AT THESE TYPES OF GAMES HE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT AND LOOKS FORWARD TO PLAYING AGAIN I THINK IT TOOK US TO PLAY

VITICULTURE SOLO JUST BOUGHT IT LAST WEEK AND GOT IT TO THE TABLE FOR A LEARNING GAME TURNS OUT IT'S A FANTASTIC SOLO EXPERIENCE AND I CAN SEE MYSELF PLAYING IT THIS WAY OFTEN PLUS I SAW THAT THERE IS A CAMPAIGN OF SORTS AT THE END OF THE RULE BOOK THAT I'LL HAVE TO CHECK OUT THE AUTOMA CARDS ARE A GREAT AND OFFER A GOOD CHALLENGE LOOKING FORWARD TO INTRODUCING THIS GAME TO MY WIFE SOON SHE'S A BIG FAN OF LORDS OF WATERDEEP AND THIS GAME FEELS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A NICE STEP UP FOR HERALDRY I HAVE THE TUSCANY EXPANSION ALREADY BUT I'M GOING TO WAIT TILL I GET A FEW PLAYS OF THE BASE GAME BEFORE TRYING IT

BIBLIOG ARRIVED AT MY FAGS A LITTLE EARLY FOR GAME NIGHT AND THREE OF US DECIDED TO PLAY THIS WHILE WE WAITED FOR OTHERS TO ARRIVE A SOLID FILLER AND EASY TO TEACH

DOMINION ALWAYS A CLASSIC WE HADN'T PLAYED IN A WHILE BUT HAVE NEVER TIRED OF THE BASE GAME WE DON'T HAVE ANY EXPANSIONS MY WIFE FLEW UNDER THE RADAR AND MY SONS WERE COMPLETELY SURPRISED WHEN THE POINTS WERE TALLIED UP

PATCHWORK MY WIFE AND I SAT DOWN FOR WHAT IS PROBABLY OUR FAVOURITE ONLY GAME THAT WE OWN IT PLAYS FAST AND OFFERS A NICE CHALLENGE SHE LOVES TO KNIT SEW AND CROTCHET SO THE THEME IS ALSO VERY APPEALING TO HERALDRY I WON BY QUITE A MARGIN AND SHE FINISHED IN THE MINUSES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME

CASTLE PANIC PLAYED WITH MY YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SHE REALLY IS GETTING GOOD AT PLAYING MORE ADVANCED GAMES

ESCAPE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE ANOTHER GAME MY DAUGHTER JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF ALTHOUGH WE DO PLAY WITH THE SAND TIMER BECAUSE SHE FINDS THE MUSIC TOO SCARY

A FEAST FOR ODIN MY TEN YEAR OLD SON IS GENERALLY NOT INTO BOARD GAMES BUT THIS GAME INTRIGUED HIM WHEN HE SAW ME PLAYING IT RECENTLY I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH FOR HIM BUT ONCE WE STARTED PLAYING I REALISED THAT IT REALLY ISN'T A HARD GAME TO PLAY BEFORE LONG HE UNDERSTOOD MOST OF THE MECHANICS AND WAS ABLE TO TAKE A TURN WITHOUT MUCH HELP HE WASN'T PLAYING WITH ANY STRATEGIES AND WE DIDN'T COUNT ANY POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME BUT HE LOVED BEING ABLE TO DO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND WAS ENGAGED THE ENTIRE TIME HE WAS ALL SMILES AFTERWARD HAVING PLAYED A HEAVIER GAME WITH DAD AND SAID THAT HE WOULD LOVE TO PLAY AGAIN SOMETIME

MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME MY FRIEND BROUGHT HIS COPY TO OUR WEEKLY NEETUP AND I GOT TO TRY IT WITH MORE THEN 2 PLAYERS AFTER PLAYS I CAN SAY THAT I'M WILLING TO INVEST IN THIS GAME FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WE REPLAYED THE FIRST SCENARIO ON REGULAR DIFFICULTY AND EASILY WON THE GAME SCALES WELL AND THE LENGTH AND DIFFICULTY OF THE FIRST SCENARIO PROVIDES A GREAT TEACHING GAME

QUESTIONS

I PLAY GAMES WITH MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY ALL THE TIME A COUPLE SHARE THE SAME INTEREST IN THE HOBBY AND ONLY ONE PERSON IS A RELUCTANT PARTICIPANT

I MADE THE MISTAKE OF TRYING TO LEARN MAGE KNIGHT WITH THREE OTHER NEW PLAYERS IT MUST HAVE GONE ON FOR AT LEAST HOURS OVER A COUPLE OF SESSIONS I WAS FAIRLY NEW TO THE HOBBY AND DIDN'T REALISE THAT GAMES COULD BE THIS COMPLEX IT DIDN'T RUIN THE GAME HOWEVER AND IT HAS GONE ON TO BE MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE
PLAY ALL THE GAMES CHECKING IN ONCE AGAIN HERE IS THE LINK TO THE ORIGINAL POST WHICH I WILL INCLUDE GOING FORWARD ADDITIONALLY HERE IS A LINK TO LAST WEEK IF YOU WANT TO SLOWLY GO BACK IN TIME PLAYED A DECENT NUMBER OF GAMES OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND BUT ONLY A FEW QUALIFIED EITHER MY WIFE WASN'T THERE OR IT WAS A GAME OWNED BY A FRIEND

GAME PIT PLAYERS THIS IS A THANKSGIVING AND VACATION CLASSIC FOR MY FAMILY I PLAYED ONE TIME WHEN ONE OF MY COUSINS WAS PRETTY YOUNG SHE HAD TO GO TO BED EARLIER BUT THE REST OF US STAYED UP AND PLAYED PIT SHE WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND ASKED WHY WE WERE PLAYING A GAME WHERE EVERYONE JUST YELLED SMALL NUMBERS AT EACH OTHER IT IS A SILLY GAME BUT DEFINITELY A BLAST WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE WE DON'T USE THE BULL BEAR CARDS AND GENERALLY DON'T BOTH KEEPING SCORE

GAME BONANZA PLAYERS THIS IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE TRADING GAME IT IS ALWAYS A LITTLE TRICKY FOR NEW PLAYERS TO NOT REARRANGE THEIR HAND AND TO ALWAYS TAKE A CARD FROM THE FRONT BUT MY PARENTS BOTH NEW PICKED UP PRETTY QUICKLY UNDERSTANDING WHEN TO OFFER THE FARM FOR A TRADE AND WHEN TO SCREW SOMEONE AND FORCING THEM TO UPROOT AND THEN PLANT SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN LUCRATIVE ARE KEYS TO THIS GAME MY DAD ENDED UP WINNING WHICH IS A RARITY FOR HIM SO THAT WAS PRETTY FUN TO SEE

GAME ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE VAMPIRE PLAYERS WE ACTUALLY HAD TOTAL PEOPLE PLAY BUT WAS THE MAX AT ANY GIVEN TIME THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE PLAYED THIS AT ALL I'D SAY THAT ALMOST EVERYONE THAT PARTICIPATED IS A ONUS VETERAN SO IT WASN'T ACTUALLY TOO TRICKY FOR ANY OF US TO PICK UP THERE IS DEFINITELY MORE GOING ON IN VAMPIRE THAN WEREWOLF BUT IT NEVER FELT OVERLY FIDDLY THE MARKS WERE INTERESTING AND I WOULD LIKE TO TRY THIS WITH A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PLAYER COUNT IDEALLY WE ONLY USED THE COUNT VAMPIRE PRIEST COPYCAT ASSASSIN MARKSMAN GREMLIN AND PICKPOCKET SOME OF THE OTHER ROLES SOUND INTERESTING AND IT COULD BE FUN TO EVEN TRY AN ULTIMATE BATTLE INCLUDING ROLES FROM ONUS



I MOSTLY PLAY GAMES WITH FAMILY MY WIFE IS MY PRIMARY GAMING PARTNER AND MY PARENTS AND SISTER ARE UP FOR IT WHEN WE SEE THEM THE IN-LAWS WILL SOMETIMES PARTICIPATE BUT THEY ARE USUALLY PRETTY RELUCTANT TO TRY ANYTHING NEW MY BROTHER IN-LAW AND HIS WIFE ARE CONVERTS AND HAVE STARTED THEIR OWN COLLECTION WHICH IS ONE OF MY PROUDER MOMENTS

LONGEST GAME I'VE PLAYED WAS A HOUR SLOG OF JOAN OF ARC I WASN'T A BIG FAN OF THE GAME DESPITE IT BEING RIDICULOUSLY CLOSE THE WHOLE WAY THE ENDING WAS EXCITING BUT THE GAME WAS JUST FAR TOO LONG FOR THE LEVEL OF ENJOYMENT COINCIDENTALLY THE SHORTEST LONG GAME I'VE PLAYED WAS A MINUTE SESSION OF GAME OF THRONES INCLUDING AFC EXPANSION
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF PLAYED IT WITH A NEW GROUP IT'S ALWAYS A BIT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO PICK UP THE FIRST ROUND BUT IT'S REALLY EASY TO GET THE HANG OF AFTER THAT REALLY ENJOYING IT AND I'M STARTING TO GET A SENSE ON ALL OF THE ROLES IN THE ORIGINAL SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MIXING IT UP WITH DAYBREAK

CODENAMES PICTURES AFTER HAVING PLAYED THIS A BIT MORE I THINK THAT I PREFER THE ORIGINAL PICTURES SEEMS TO BE PREFERRED BY OTHERS THOUGH AND I DON'T MIND PLAYING IT AT ALL IT DOES SEEM LIKE IT'S GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF DEPTH AND THEREFOR MORE LONGEVITY THOUGH

COUP I'VE HAD THIS FOR A WHILE BUT NEVER GOTTEN AROUND TO PLAYING IT SO I WAS HAPPY WHEN THE HOST OF A BOARD GAME MEET UP BROUGHT IT OUT I WAS GOD AWFUL AT IT BUT I THINK I'LL REALLY ENJOY THIS GAME

PANDEMIC REIGN OF CTHULHU I PLAYED THIS TWICE WITH MY F THIS WEEKEND AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT WE LOST BOTH TIMES SINCE WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE SUBTLE STRATEGIC DIFFERENCES FROM REGULAR PANDEMIC OR MAYBE CAUSE WE HAD POOR CHARACTER COMBINATIONS BUT THE THEME REALLY ENHANCED THE EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN VANILLA PANDEMIC
PLAYED SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE FOR THE FIRST TIME AT A FRIENDS HOUSE IT WAS REALLY ENJOYABLE FIRST GAME WAS A LITTLE ROUGH DUE TO 2 PLAYERS BEING NEW AND I CHOOSE A MORE SUPPORT ORIENTED CHARACTER CAPTAIN COSMIC THE GREEN LANTERN ONE SINCE THE PLAYERS SAID WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE SUPERHERO

SECOND GAME WAS A LOT MORE FUN AS I PLAYED GUISE AND COULD MAKE REALLY LARGE COMBOS ON MY TURN CRANKING OUT LOTS OF DAMAGE

ALL IN ALL I LOOK FORWARD TO PLAYING AGAIN AND TRYING OUT MORE CHARACTERS
WITH THE EXTENDED FAMILY DURING THANKSGIVING WE PLAYED SOME COUP AND THE RESISTANCE

CONCLUSION IF YOU HAVE THE PLAYERS FOR THE RESISTANCE THAT IS A FAR BETTER GAME WHAT A HIT THAT WAS

OUT OF THE TIMES WE PLAYED SPIES WON OF THEM SO MANY ACCUSATIONS COUPLES IMMEDIATELY ACCUSING THE OTHER OF BEING A SPY

FANTASTIC LYING PERFORMANCES THAT LED A CORRECT ABOUT TO WIN RESISTANCE ASTRAY JUST TREMENDOUS

MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME SEVERAL PLAYS BOTH SOLO AND WITH MY WIFE WE BARELY GOT TRASHED BY THE BOSS IN THE FINAL SCENARIO WOULD OF WON WITHOUT COMBAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR SOME BAD DRAWS ON THE ENCOUNTER DECK

WE'RE GOING TO TRY AGAIN WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AND INCLUDING THE CURSE OF THE ROUGAROO AFTER THE FIRST ACT

MACHS VS MINIONS WE DID THE DEFEND THE SCHOOL FROM WAVES OF ATTACK MISSION WITH ONLY MACHS WOULD OF BEEN EASIER WITH TO GET A PERFECT RESULT WE DECIDED THAT JUST ONE MINION GETTING THROUGH WAS ACCEPTABLE

THIS FRIDAY MORE MACHS VS MINIONS MYTHOS TALES AND MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME



QUESTION I OFTEN PLAY WITH MY WIFE AND WITH THE KIDS AS WELL THEY ARE FOR THE MOST PART NEARLY EQUAL TO MY INTEREST THOUGH MY DAUGHTER OVERALL IS LESS SO ON MOST GAMES

QUESTION 2 LONGEST GAME PROBABLY ELDRITCH HORROR VS SO MANY COMBAT ENCOUNTERS

MY SS ALSO GOT ME INNS AND CATHEDRALS EXPANSION FOR CARCASSONNE BUT I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY IT YET
MARKHAM HORROR CG PLAYED THROUGH THE FIRST SCENARIO THREE TIMES TO GET THE HANG OF HOW THE GAME WORKS I WAS A BIT SKEPTICAL OF THE CHAOS BAG BUT I THINK IT'S MORE TENSE THAN DICE ROLLING REALLY ENJOYING THIS SO FAR

VAST THE CRYSTAL CAVERNS HAD ONLY PLAYED THIS 2 PLAYER BEFORE DOVE IN TO A FOUR PLAYER GAME WITH TWO NEW PLAYERS AND THAT LEARNING CURVE IS STEEP THE GAME CAME DOWN TO A VERY CLOSE ENDING BUT IT TOOK WAY TOO LONG TO GET THERE MOST OF THAT WAS DUE TO THE LEARNING ELEMENT I THINK THIS GAME CAN BE GOOD BUT EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT BEFORE YOU UNLOCK A REALLY ENJOYABLE PLAY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN HOW CLOSE EVERYONE IS TO ACHIEVING THEIR GOAL AND WHAT ACTIONS THEY CAN TAKE HOPEFULLY THE SECOND PRINTING KICKSTARTER WITH UPDATED RULES WILL ADD SOME CLARITY THE FIRST EDITION RULES ARE LACKING CLARITY

DEAD OF WINTER MY FIRST ACTION WAS TO MOVE ONE OF MY CHARACTERS INTO A BUILDING WITH TWO OTHERS AND I ROLLED THE DREADED BITE ON THE EXPOSURE DIE QUITE A DRAMATIC START FORTUNATELY THE EXPOSURE DIDN'T SPREAD AND WE WERE ABLE TO RECOVER FOR A FAIRLY EASY TEAM VICTORY ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T ACCOMPLISH MY SECRET OBJECTIVE

BETRAYAL HOUSE ON THE HILL W WIDOWS WALK EXPANSION GOT ONE OF THE NEW HAUNTS WHICH HAD A NICE LITERARY REFERENCE THEME DIDN'T SEE TOO MANY OF THE NEW CARDS TILES WE DID NOTICE MORE MOVEMENT FLEXIBILITY BETWEEN FLOORS THANKS TO THE DUMBWAITER SYSTEM AS ALWAYS THE HAUNT INCLUDED A FAIR AMOUNT OF RULES DECIPHERING DUE TO A LACK OF CLARITY BUT THAT'S THE WAY BETRAYAL ALWAYS IS
LORD OF THE RINGS CG BEEN WANTING TO GET MORE PLAYS IN

PLAYED MANY OTHERS BUT SPACE CADETS IST WORTH TO MENTION 4H PLAYTIME FEELS LIKE WORKING HEALY HARD FOR THE WIN BUT AT THE SAME TIME CREATING SO MUCH INSIDERS AMONG THE PLAYERS A VERY BINDING EXPERIENCE
THE GRIZZLED TOOK THIS OUT ON OUR BLACK FRIDAY BREWERY TOUR BY THE THIRD GAME NORMAL SETTING AND THE SECOND BREWERY WE FINALLY GOT OUR BOYS HOME WITH ONLY ONE CARD LEFT IN THE MORALE STACK TENSE

CAMEL UP I PLAYED THIS WITH MY TWO NEPHEWS AND MY SISTER AND MY FIANCE THEY BOYS DID A GREAT JOB THE OLDER ONE DID TERRIBLY IN THE FIRST GAME BUT HE CAME BACK AND DID GREAT IN THE SECOND GAME I'M GLAD THEY REALLY SEEMED TO LIKE IT AFTER WE LEFT MY SISTER TEXTED ME AND TOLD ME THEY WERE NOW DESIGNING A BOARD GAME HAHA

TRUMP THE GAME I WENT TO VISIT MY COLLEGE ROOMMATE AND HIS FIANCE AND I KNEW HE HAD THIS IT SIMPLY HAD TO GET PLAYED LOL IT WAS ABOUT AS GOOD AS A GAME FROM UNDER THE TRUMP BRAND COULD BE IT'S HONESTLY NOT THE WORST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED BUT IT'S PRETTY SHIT LOL

LE FANTÔME DE I PLAYED THIS WITH MY YEAR OLD NIECE AND SHE UNDERSTOOD THE RULES BUT SHE WASN'T PLAYING VERY STRATEGICALLY IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY CLOSE BUT SHE COULDN'T GET THERE RIGHT AT THE END

OREGON THIS WAS THE LAST GAME OF THE WEEKEND I PLAYED IT WITH HER DAD I'D LIKE TO HAVE PLAYED IT WITH MORE BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME I LOVE THIS GAME AND HE LIKED IT A LOT TOO



I CONSIDER MY FIANCE TO BE MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY SO ALL THE TIME HER SIDE OF THE FAMILY IS MORE INTERESTED IN GAMES THAN MINE MY SISTER LIKES THEM A LOT IF WE CAN GET HER TO PLAY HER DAD WILL ALWAYS BE DOWN FOR A GAME BUT HE'S NOT THE BEST AT REMEMBERING RULES SOMETIMES

I'M REALLY NOT SURE I RECENTLY PLAYED THE HORRIFICALLY BAD STORM THE CASTLE AND THAT TOOK ABOUT HOURS FELT LIKE I'VE PROBABLY PLAYED A HOUR GAME OF RISK SOMETIME IND WAS USUALLY HOURS IF THAT COUNTS

ORLEANS W ORLEANS INVASION PLAYED THE INVASION SCENARIO CO-OP WE WERE KIND OF CLOSE TO WINNING THE FIRST GAME NOT CLOSE AT ALL THE SECOND GAME AND MISSING ONLY ONE WORKER IN THE LAST GAME HAD THE SPACE TO PLACE IT HAD THE MEEDLESS TO PLACE BUT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SCENARIOS WHERE I HAVE IN MY BAG OF MEEDLESS I ONLY NEED OF THE I CAN DRAW AND I DREW ALL BUT THE COLOR I NEEDED BAH WILL BE TRYING AGAIN SOON

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF DAYBREAK WITH ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF INTRODUCED THIS TO MY FAMILY ON THANKSGIVING FUN WAS HAD BY ALL FIRST TIME PLAYING WITH DAYBREAK I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE FOR EXPERIENCED ONUS PLAYERS AS SOME OF THE ROLES WERE A LITTLE COMPLEX FOR JUST INTRODUCING IT TO WE TRIED TWICE WITH THE INFO OVERLOAD SETUP IN THE DAYBREAK RULES THEN ONCE WITH THE TOTAL CHAOS SETUP THE TOTAL CHAOS SETUP WAS A LOT OF FUN

GAME OF THRONES HAND OF THE KING MY LOSING STREAK CONTINUES IT NOW STANDS AT

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY WITH ROLL FOR THE GALAXY AMBITION SPLIT THE GAMES WITH MY WIFE I LIKE THE NEW BLACK ORANGE DICE THAT ARE ADDED AND THE EXTRA HOME TILES I DON'T REALLY CARE MUCH ABOUT THE CARDS MAY JUST LEAVE THOSE OUT IN THE FUTURE THOUGH I GUESS THEY DON'T TAKE LONG TO SETUP AND CAN GIVE SOMETHING TO WORK TOWARD

A FEAST FOR ODIN SOLO PLAYED ONCE TO GET THE HANG OF IT BEFORE I TEACH MY WIFE MY SCORE WAS TERRIBLE BUT THAT'S PARTIALLY DUE TO MY FORGETTING TO UPGRADE MY SHEEP AND COWS INTO THINGS I COULD ACTUALLY USE TO COVER LARGE SPACES ON THE BOARD OOPS



HOW OFTEN DO YOU PLAY GAMES WITH YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY DO THEY SHARE YOUR SAME INTEREST IN THE HOBBY OR ARE THEY RELUCTANT PARTICIPANTS

USUALLY ONCE OR TWICE PER YEAR I ALWAYS BRING SMALL GAMES TO FAMILY FUNCTIONS BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS GET PLAYED THIS PAST WEEKEND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET THEM TO PLAY GAMES OF ONUS AND GAME OF AGCT HAND OF THE KING

WHAT IS THE LONGEST GAME YOU'VE EVER PLAYED

I'VE PLAYED TWILIGHT IMPERIUM THIRD EDITION EXACTLY ONCE RULES EXPLANATION WAS CLOSE TO AN HOUR WE ACTUALLY PLAYED FOR HOURS AND CALLED IT QUITS DUE TO OTHER OBLIGATIONS I THINK WE WERE MAYBE DONE HONESTLY I DIDN'T LIKE IT NOT ONE BIT HOWEVER I WAS BARELY INTO THE HOBBY AT THAT POINT AND NOW THAT I'VE PLAYED TONS MORE GAMES I KEEP THINKING BACK TO AND THINGS IT DID VERY WELL I WANT TO PLAY AGAIN

RUNNERS UP MAGE KNIGHT A COUPLE EARLIER GAMES WERE CLOSE TO HOURS SOLO AND THROUGH THE AGES A NEW STORY OF CIVILIZATION FIRST GAME WAS HOURS GAMES ARE ABOUT

GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL

WOW THIS PARTICULAR PLAY REALLY EXEMPLIFIED HOW BRUTAL THE GAME CAN BE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

MY OPPONENT IN A TWO PLAYER GAME WAS STUCK WITH THREE CUSTOMERS THAT HE SIMPLY COULDN'T FEED THE NUMBER ONE DICE BAY FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM THE ONE THAT GIVES YOU CAKE AND STRUDEL NEVER FILLED WITH MORE THAN A DICE OR TWO AT MOST FOR JUST ABOUT THE ENTIRE 2ND HALF OF THE GAME SAME WITH THE SIX PIP DICE SLOT THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED MY OPPONENT THE OPTION TO TAKE CAKE AND STRUDEL AT A COST THOSE WHO HAVE PLAYED THE GAME WILL KNOW HOW HARD IT CAN BE TO GET STRUDEL AS YOU NEED AT LEAST TWO OF THE TEN DICE YOU ROLL TO SHOW ONE PIP IN ORDER TO GET ONE STRUDEL PER ROUND SO HE SIMPLY COULD NOT MOVE THOSE THREE CUSTOMERS TO THEIR ROOMS AT ALL THEY WERE STUCK HE COULDN'T EVEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EMPERORS TRACK FOOD BONUS TO FREE UP A SLOT BY FULLY FEEDING A CUSTOMER AT ONE POINT BECAUSE THE WAY I READ IT IN THE RULES ONE CANNOT MOVE A CUSTOMER TO HIS ROOM EXCEPT DURING ONES TURN SO HE COULDN'T EVEN GRAB A CUSTOMER BEFORE HIS NEXT TURN I CONFESS I TOOK STRUDEL DICE JUST TO BLOCK HIM IT WAS BRUTAL I CAME VERY CLOSE TO LAPPING HIM ON THE SCORING TRACK AS IT WAS SMOOTH SAILING FOR ME I HAD THE ONE-TIME GIVING EMPLOYEE AMONG OTHER THINGS AND I WAS JUST FILLING UP ROOM AFTER ROOM AFTER ROOM STILL LIKE IT THOUGH WILL PROBABLY EVEN ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION THIS COMING WEEK BUT YES IT CAN BE BRUTAL

GATES OF LOYANG

I WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME BUT AFTER THE TWO PLAYS THIS WEEK I DON'T THINK IT'LL EVER END UP IN MY COLLECTION DESPITE IT HAVING BEEN DESIGNED BY UWE ROSENBERG ONE OF MY FAVORITE DESIGNERS LE HAVRE AND AGRICOLA WERE MY GATEWAY GAMES INTO MODERN GAMING THE THING THAT REALLY RUINS IT FOR ME IS THE DRAFT SOMETIMES YOU SIMPLY CANNOT GET THE CARDS YOU NEED TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IT SEEMS THE PAY TWO BUCK FOR TWO CARDS ACTION HELPS BUT NOT ENOUGH I WAS THINKING MAYBE A HOUSE RULE FIX COULD BE A BIDDING ROUND WITH A LITTLE EXTRA CASH GIVEN TO EACH PLAYER FROM A PUBLIC TABLEAU OF CARDS IT'S ALSO A BIT FIDDLY

RUSSIAN RAILROADS

TAUGHT A FRIEND THIS GAME HE LIKED IT EASY ENOUGH TO TEACH PUTTING THIS BACK INTO THE ROTATION UNTIL I GET TO THE TEN GAMES PLAYED THRESHOLD PLANNING ON BUSTING OUT THE GERMAN RAILROADS EXPANSION SOON AS WELL AS BUYING THE AMERICAN RAILROADS EXPANSION FROM THE BG STORE
ONE ISSUE THE TWO PLAYER GAME SEEMS A LITTLE SHORT TO ME WE HADN'T MOVED OUR TRACKS VERY FAR DOWN THE BOARD BY END

THE ALLERGIST

AGAIN AS I SAID BEFORE THIS GAME DOES NOT REWARD TOO MUCH IN THE WAY OF EXPERIMENTATION I ABSOLUTELY DOMINATED THE INFLUENCE TRACK THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET HAD THE MOST WORKERS ALL OF THEM OUT ON THE BOARD AND HAD SO MANY PINK DUDES IN MY GALLERY IT WAS OBSCENE BUT I SIMPLY DID NOT DISCOVER ENOUGH ARTISTS AND IN MY OPINION I THINK SELLING ART TO FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE SOLD ART BONUS CARD IS A VERY WEAK PLAY APPARENTLY ONE SHOULD ALWAYS FILL UP ONE'S GALLERY AND LEAVE IT FILLED MY OPPONENT ALMOST CONCEDED BUT I ENDED UP LOSING TO HER IN THE END THIS GAME IS NOT JUST ABOUT RIDING HIGH ON THE INFLUENCE TRACK AS SOME OF THE FORUMS WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE IT'S PRIMARILY DISCOVER THEN BUY DISCOVER THEN BUY PROMOTE PROMOTE WHICH I GUESS FITS THEMATICALLY SO I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH I GUESS

BRUXELLES

FINALLY GETTING MY PLAYS OF A GAME THAT SPENT FAR TOO LONG GATHERING DUST ON THE SHELF SUCH AN ELEGANT GAME SO HAPPY TO OWN IT STAYING IN THE ROTATION

CITY OF IRON SECOND EDITION

FUN TO PLAY BUT SEEMS A LITTLE FLAWED RUNAWAY LEADER PROBLEM MAYBE A ROUND OR TWO TOO SHORT MAYBE SOME OF THE ERA C CARDS SEEM PRETTY USELESS THE ONE POINT FOR EVERY THREE PURPLE CRYSTALS CARD LIKE EVER GOING TO GRAB THAT WHO WILL EVER HAVE MORE THAN A FEW CRYSTALS BY THAT POINT TO BEGIN WITH IT'S FUN TO PLAY I LIKE MOST OF THE MECHANICS AND THE ART IS VERY NICE BUT IT KIND OF LEAVES YOU WANTING FOR MORE

VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO

PUT THIS GAME BACK INTO THE ROTATION AND IT WAS A HIT WITH THE TWO PEOPLE I TAUGHT MY FAVORITE DICE GAME AS BOTH LOW ROLLS AND HIGH ROLLS CAN BE VERY USEFUL BECAUSE BAD LUCK DOESN'T SO MUCH AS PUNISH YOU BUT JUST CHANGES YOUR STRATEGY LOW ROLLS I'M TRAVELLING THIS ROUND I GUESS
TO TEACH AND VERY FUN KEEPING IT IN THE ROTATION FOR NOW EVEN THOUGH I HAVE PLENTY OF PLAYS LOGGED AS OF TODAY

FAR SPACE FOUNDRY WITH ETHER ORE EXTRA PILOTS AND EXTRA PRODUCTS EXPANSIONS

FIRST TIME FOR ALL FOUR PLAYERS LEARNING THE GAME BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH TO LEARN IT WAS A LITTLE STRESSFUL WAS HARD TO GET A GRIP ON WHAT STRATEGIES WILL WORK DURING PLAY THE TWO MAIN PHASES ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO WORK OUT THAT FIRST AT THE END YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU DONE BETTER I CAN SEE THEREFORE HOW A SECOND PLAY WOULD BE A BIT MORE ENJOYABLE WITH ALL PLAYERS EXPERIENCED AND FOREWARNED OF WHAT'S TO COME THEME AND MECHANICS MAKE SENSE THE THINGY CAN BE A LITTLE TOUGH TO GET USED TO FOR SOME IT SEEMS TURN ORDER MATTERS A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR MY LIKING MAYBE FIRST PLAYER NOT NICE IN A FOUR PLAYER GAME MAYBE I DUNNO WILL BE HAPPY TO PLAY AGAIN TO GIVE IN ANOTHER CHANCE EXPANSIONS WERE FINE

CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG WITH THE SECRETS EXPANSION

QUICK TWO PLAYER GAME SEEMS TO END TOO QUICKLY SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY WITH TWO PLAYERS WE THREW IN ALL THE EXPANSIONS NEITHER BOUGHT OR USED MOATS NOR SECRET PASSAGES IT WAS LATE AND MAYBE WE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WITH THE PASSAGES OR SIMPLY FORGOT IGNORED THEM EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD HAVE LIKELY ADDED SEVERAL POINTS I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH SECRETS ADDS TO THE GAME AND HONESTLY I COULD DO WITHOUT IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO IMPROVE THE GAME MUCH IF AT ALL IN MY OPINION

EDIT SMALL GRAMMAR FIX


I GOT IN SOME GREAT GAMES IN THIS WEEK

WONDERS DUEL THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED WITH THE PANTHEON EXPANSION I ENJOYED WHAT IT ADDED TO THE GAME BUT I PLAYED A TERRIBLE FIRST AGE NOT GETTING ANY RESOURCES TO SPEAK OF AND ENDED UP LOSING TO MY OPPONENT IN AGE BY WAY OF A MILITARY VICTORY PROBABLY MY WORST GAME OF DUEL THAT I CAN REMEMBER SO I'M EAGER TO GET IT BACK TO THE TABLE SOON

MARGI THIS WENT BETTER FOR ME I WAS INTRODUCING IT TO MY BUDDY THAT CRUSHED ME IN DUEL AND HE CAUGHT ON QUICKLY THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE TWO PLAYER GAMES AND I WAS GLAD HE LIKED IT AS WELL

CODENAMES PLAYED THIS WITH MY WIFE BROTHER AND SISTER-IN-LAW BEFORE GOT INTO OUR GAME OF PANDEMIC LEGACY ALTHOUGH THIS IS MY FAVORITE BIG GROUP GAME I ALSO LIKE IT AT AS IT SPREADS THE PRESSURE AROUND EQUALLY TONS OF FUN

PANDEMIC LEGACY WE WON OUR FIRST GAME OF MARCH I'M HOPING AT SOME POINT I CAN CONVINCE EVERYONE TO PLAY TWICE IN A ROW SO WE CAN MOVE A BIT QUICKER BUT I'M ENJOYING OUR SLOW TROD THROUGH THE YEAR

ISTANBUL I'VE BEEN BUSY WITH GRAD SCHOOL AND HAVEN'T BEEN AS ACTIVE IN THE NEETUP GROUP I ATTEND LATELY SO I WAS EXCITED WHEN THEY MOVED THE REGULAR FRIDAY MEETING THIS WEEK TO SATURDAY WHICH MEANT I COULD MAKE IT I HADN'T PLAYED ISTANBUL BEFORE AND I GOT FIVE TRIBES VIBES FROM IT PARTICULARLY AS THE SPATIAL PUZZLE DIDN'T COME TO ME INTUITIVELY HOWEVER JUST LIKE FIVE TRIBES GREW ON ME IMMENSELY AS I GOT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH IT I CAN SEE ISTANBUL DOING THE SAME WE PLAYED WITH THE MOCHA EXPANSION AND A COUPLE OF PROMO TILES AS WELL REALLY ENJOYED IT

VITICULTURE WE ALSO PLAYED THIS AT THE NEETUP AS I'M OFTEN INTRODUCING THIS AND OTHER GAMES TO MY FRIENDS I WAS GLAD TO PLAY WITH OTHER EXPERIENCED PLAYERS WE PLAYED WITH THE EXTENDED BOARD FROM TUSCANY AS WELL AS THE ADVANCED VISITORS MOOR VISITORS PROPERTY EXPANSION AND MAMAS AND PAPAS ALTHOUGH I STILL FIND THE RANDOM CARD DRAW FRUSTRATING AT TIMES IT REMAINS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES



I PLAY WITH MY WIFE 2 OR TIMES A MONTH MAYBE ONCE A WEEK IF I'M LUCKY I PLAY WITH MY BROTHER ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS MAYBE ONCE A MONTH IF WE CAN GET TOGETHER MORE OFTEN MY BROTHER SHARES MY LOVE OF GAMES BUT DOESN'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME INVESTED IN THE HOBBY PODCASTS FORUMS ETC WHEREAS MY WIFE ONLY PLAYS GAMES BECAUSE I ENJOY THEM ALTHOUGH SHE HAS HER FAVORITES I MIGHT PLAY WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR AT HOLIDAYS OR OTHER TIMES


RIFF RAFF THIS HAS BEEN A DEXTERITY GRAIL GAME FOR ME YOU PLACE PIECES ONTO A ROCKING AND ROTATING PIRATE SHIP IT REALLY MOVES LIKE A SHIP AT SEA LOVED IT

THE ORACLE OF DELPHI STILL ENJOYING THE LATEST FELD I HAD A VERY SATISFYING FINAL TURN WHERE I MANAGED TO COMPLETE MY FINAL THREE TASKS AND RETURN TO ZEUS FOR THE WIN

ROLL PLAYER FUN PUZZLE DICE GAME WITH A GREAT THEME I WAS A SCOUNDREL ORC PALADIN WITH A BACKSTORY OF THE CHOSEN ONE I CAME IN LAST

HAMSTERROLLE ANOTHER DEXTERITY GAME I'VE WANTED TO PLAY FOR A WHILE I ENJOYED IT BUT NOT AS MUCH AS RIFF RAFF

AQUASPHERE MAN THIS GAME IS TIGHT THERE'S SO MUCH YOU WANT TO DO BUT YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DO IT ALL I UNDERSTAND TOM POINT ABOUT IT PLAYING LIKE YOU'RE IN A STRAIGHT JACKET I LOVED IT

MOMBASA WE GOT OFF TO A ROCKY START BUT GOT THE HANG OF IT EVENTUALLY I FOCUSED ON INVESTING HEAVILY IN ONE COMPANY TO MY DETRIMENT I'D LOVE TO GIVE IT ANOTHER GO


I PLAY LIGHTER GAMES WITH MY FAMILY A FEW TIMES A YEAR I CAN SOMETIMES CAJOLE MY OLDER DAUGHTER INTO SOMETHING HEAVIER

I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER PLAYED A GAME THAT TOOK MORE THAN HOURS
WIFE AND I FINISHED APRIL IN PANDEMIC LEGACY YESTERDAY WE HAD WON THE PAST TWO MONTHS SO OUR FUNDING WAS DOWN TO WE FULLY EXPECTED TO LOOSE SUPER FAST BUT ENDED UP PULLING A WIN OUT BY THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH HAHA ON TO MAY NOW AND THE OUTLOOK IS IFFY HAHA
A FEAST FOR ODIN MY WIFE AND I FEASTED ALL OF LAST WEEK THE FIRST TWO GAMES WE WERE EXPLORING ALL THE DIFFERENT ACTIONS BY NOW WE'VE FELL INTO A STRATEGY WE WANT TO MASTER SHE'S GOING THE EMIGRATION AND CATTLE ROUTE I'M GOING THE EXPLORATION AND SHEDS ROUTE THERE IS LOTS OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT

LORDS OF THE WATERDEEP SUCH AN EXCELLENT GAME TO INTRODUCE NEW PEOPLE TO WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES OR EVEN TO GAMES IN GENERAL IT'S VERY EASY TO TEACH AND VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO PLAY MY FRIENDS WHO NEVER PLAYED ANY MODERN GAMES BEFORE THE CLOSEST TO THAT IS CATAN CAUGHT ON QUICK THEY WERE IMPRESSED AND HAD LOTS OF FUN THIS GATEWAY GAME OPENED THEIR EYES I CAN'T WAIT TO INTRODUCE THEM TO MY OTHER GAMES

I PLAY MOSTLY WITH MY WIFE OCCASIONALLY I BRING MY LIGHTER GAMES TO FAMILY GATHERINGS AND HAVE A BLAST BECAUSE IT'S NICE TO SEE THEIR REACTION AND MENTALITY CHANGE ABOUT BOARD GAMING

THE LONGEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED ARE AGRICOLA AND A FEAST FOR ODIN

HAD A GREAT WEEK OF GAMING FELT GOOD ON MONDAY H AND I GOT A FEW GAMES OF FLASK IN SINCE WE HAD PLANNED TO TAKE IT TO MY FAMILY S THANKSGIVING GET TOGETHER WE AREN T NORMALLY INTO DEXTERITY GAMES BUT FLASK IS DEFINITELY A WINNER AIR HOCKEY FOR BOARD GAMERS ENOUGH SAID REALLY I WON 2 OF

ON THANKSGIVING WE TRIED OUT CODENAMES WITH MY SISTERS SO WE HAD A TWO ON TWO GAME I VE ONLY EVER PLAYED THIS GAME TWO VS TWO OR THREE VS THREE I THINK IT PROBABLY WORKS BETTER WITH MORE PLAYERS AND WORKS MUCH BETTER WHEN EVERYONE IS DECENTLY EXPERIENCED AT IT I WOULD GO AS FAR TO SAY THAT IT KINDA JUST SUCKS IF YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE I THINK MY SISTERS LIKED IT OK BUT IT WASN T EXACTLY THE GREAT FUN THAT I THINK THEY WERE EXPECTING

NEXT WE BROUGHT OUT THE ELECTRONIC CATCHPHRASE WHICH ACTUALLY WAS THE GREAT FUN MY SISTERS WERE EXPECTING HAVEN T LAUGHED THAT HARD AT A PARTY GAME IN A LONG TIME VERY FUN VERY UNDERRATED GOOD TIME

FINALLY I BROUGHT OUT FLASK AND PLAYED A FEW ROUNDS A PIECE WITH MY NIECE MY NEPHEW AND H MY NIECE IS SEVEN AND SEEMED TO LIKE IT OK BUT LOST INTEREST AFTER A GAME MY NEPHEW IS AND SEEMED TO LIKE IT QUITE A BIT BUT ALSO EVENTUALLY KINDA LOST INTEREST AND LIKED JUST PLAYING WITH THE PIECES INSTEAD

FRIDAY AFTER THANKSGIVING WE BOTH HAD WORK OFF SO H AND I WERE ABLE TO GET A FAIR AMOUNT OF GAMING IN PLAYED A MORNING GAME OF CASTLES OF BURGUNDY ALWAYS FUN FOR US A GREAT GAME TO PLAY IN THE MORNING OVER COFFEE WE PLAYED WITH THE MONASTERY BOARDS BUT FORGOT TO ACTUALLY SCORE THEM WHOOPS H WON

NEXT WAS A QUICK GAME OF ONITAMA WHICH H GOT THE BEST OF ME IN

A BIT LATER IN THE AFTERNOON WE GOT OUR NEW COPY OF GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL TO THE TABLE WE FIRST PLAYED AT GEN CON OVER THE SUMMER AND I VE BEEN ITCHING FOR IT TO COME BACK INTO PRINT EVER SINCE IT WAS AS GOOD AS I REMEMBER I MADE A MISTAKE AT THE END AND SEATED A GUEST WHEN I COULDN T ACTUALLY FULFILL HIS ORDER AND HAD TO LOSE FIVE POINTS THIS SEEMED TO ULTIMATELY LOSE ME THE GAME WHEN I LOST BY THREE POINTS

THE LAST GAME OF THE DAY WAS FIVE TRIBES WHICH WE HAD NEVER PLAYED BEFORE VERY TACTICAL THE FIRST SEVERAL MOVES SEEM TO BE MORE OF A I LL MOVE THIS HERE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TYPE OF DEAL INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FORM SOME SORT OF STRATEGY I DO LOVE GAMES THAT EMPLOYEE A MANCALA MECHANISM EVEN IF I M NOT ALWAYS THAT GREAT AT FIGURING THEM OUT H THOUGHT THE BOARD WAS TOO BUSY AND THAT WAS IT WAS KIND OF A PAIN IN THE ASS KEEPING TRACK OF EVERYTHING WHICH I DON T NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH STILL I LIKED THE GAME AND I M LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING IT AGAIN

SATURDAY NIGHT WE GOT A FEW IN WHEN I GOT HOME FROM WORK LEARNED DARKROCK VENTURES WHICH WAS A BIT OF A BLIND KICKSTARTER BACK FOR ME I BACKED IT BECAUSE AT THE TIME WE DIDN T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE THEMED GAMES NOW WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OH WELL I THOUGHT DARKROCK WAS A DECENT GAME BUT VERY LIGHT MAYBE TOO LIGHT FOR OUR TASTES YOU CAN MITIGATE THE DICE ROLLS TO AN EXTENT BUT YOU WILL ALSO LIKELY COME TO AT LEAST ONE TURN WHERE YOU CAN MANIPULATE THE HELL OUT OF THE DICE AND STILL END UP WITH NOTHING H DISLIKED THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE GAME WHICH I ALSO DON T DISAGREE WITH I DID THINK THE GAME WAS FINE AND MAYBE IT CAN SCRATCH THE ITCH WHEN WE DON T FEEL LIKE THINKING VERY HARD

FOLLOWED UP WITH ROLL PLAYER WHICH WAS A MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL KICKSTARTER BACK FOR US WE ENDED UP TYING THIS GAME BUT H HAD MORE GOLD AND WON THE TIE BREAKER

ON SUNDAY PLAYED LEGENDS OF ANDOR TWICE HAD NEVER PLAYED BEFORE WENT THROUGH THE TUTORIAL ONCE AND THE INTRODUCTORY LEGEND TWICE INITIAL IMPRESSION THIS GAME IS HARD I HAD KINDA THOUGHT WE WOULD SPEND MOST OF THE DAY PLAYING THE GAME GOING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS BUT AFTER LOSING THE SECOND TIME AND REALIZING WE HAD ACCIDENTALLY SKIPPED A LEGEND CARD MAKING THE GAME EASIER WE GOT A LITTLE FRUSTRATED AND PACKED IT UP I THINK IT S A GOOD GAME WELL DESIGNED AND I M LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING OTHER SCENARIOS AND POSSIBLY GETTING SOME OF THE EXPANSIONS HOWEVER I M NOT AS MUCH OF A FAN OF GETTING PUMMELED BY THE BOARD OVER AND OVER I DON T WANT TO HOUSE RULE IT QUITE YET BUT HAVE READ SEVERAL WAYS TO MAKE THE GAME A BIT EASIER

QUESTIONS

ALMOST NEVER JUST AT THANKSGIVING PRETTY MUCH I DO ALMOST ALL OF MY GAMING WITH MY GIRLFRIEND MY SISTERS AND MOM HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE HOBBY BUT THEY WILL READILY PLAY A PARTY STYLE GAME AT A FAMILY GATHERING

LONGEST GAME I ACTUALLY ENJOYED BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA IF IT S OVER TWO HOURS FOR US IT S PROBABLY TOO LONG

REAL THANKSGIVING WAS LAST MONTH BUT I HOPE YOU AMERICANS HAD GOOD TIMES WITH FAMILY HERE'S WHAT I PLAYED THIS WEEK

DIMMET PLAYED PLAYERS WITH THE WIFE MOTHER-IN-LAW AND SISTER FIRST TIME FOR ALL OF US THOUGH I HAVE PLAYED THE APP A FEW TIMES IT WAS DECENT WE HAD TO CUT IT SHORT SLIGHTLY BUT MY SISTER WAS WINNING

LORDS OF VEGAS PLAYERS AS ABOVE FIRST TIME FOR ALL OF US AGAIN I WON PRETTY FUN GAME I SEE HOW IT COULD REPLACE MONOPOLY IN MANY WAYS AND STILL RETAIN SOME OF THE ELEMENTS FROM IT

CASTLES OF BURGUNDY FIRST TIME PLAYING WITH THE WIFE I WON BUT WE BOTH LOVE THIS GAME AND WE ALREADY LOVED THE CARD GAME VERSION WE'LL BE PLAYING AGAIN SOON

DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG A COUPLE HOURS STRAIGHT AT MY FAGS WITH CLOSE TO MAX PLAYER COUNT PER ROUND WHAT A GREAT GAME THE MORE I PLAY THE MORE I LOVE IT I GUESS THAT'S WHY IT'S MY FAVORITE

NEW BEDFORD TAUGHT THE WIFE HOW TO PLAY SHE LIKED IT MORE THAN EXPECTED GIVEN THE THEME BUT STILL NOT AS GOOD AS VITICULTURE SHE SAYS I WON

THE GAME SOLO I CAN'T REMEMBER MY SCORE BUT IT WASN'T THAT GOOD I LIKE THIS LITTLE GAME AND CAN'T WAIT UNTIL I SLEEVE IT SO I CAN PLAY IT WITH OTHERS THE NORTH AMERICAN RELEASE HAS HORRIBLE CARD QUALITY BLACK CARDS WHICH DAMAGE VERY EASILY

I ALSO PLAYED SOME APP GAMES LIKE SAN JUAN SPLENDOR LABYRINTH ETC

I PLAY REGULARLY WITH MY WIFE SHE LIKES TO GAME A LOT ALSO WITH MY YEAR-OLD WHO LOVES HIS BOARD GAMES I JUST GET A LITTLE BORED WITH HIS GAMES SO I HOPE HIS INTEREST STAYS AS HE GETS OLDER AND CAN PLAY SOME OF THE REST OF MY COLLECTION MY SISTER GAMES WITH US ONCE EVERY WEEK OR TWO

2 LONGEST I'VE PLAYED PROBABLY STAR TREK FRONTIERS THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED IT SOLO AND WAS TEACHING MYSELF I THINK IT TOOK LIKE HOURS BECAUSE IT'S COMPLEX AND I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A MISTAKE AND THE RULEBOOKS ARE A LITTLE CONFUSING HAVING TO JUMP ALL OVER THE PLACE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING SOLO
ASCENSION APPRENTICE EDITION SOLO THERE AREN'T A LOT OF GAMES THAT CAN BE PICKED UP FOR IN CANADA ANYWAYS AND I DOUBT I'D FIND MANY OF THEM AS SATISFYING AS ASCENSION PLAYED MY FIRST GAME ON MONDAY AND BOTCHED THE HONOUR COUNT CAUSING THE GAME TO DRAG OUT REALLY LONG IT WAS FUN REGARDLESS PLAYED TWO GAMES YESTERDAY FOCUSING ON WIFE-BOUND HEROES IN THE FIRST AND ON MECHANAL IN THE SECOND I WAS REALLY DUBIOUS OF THE MECHANAL STRATEGY SINCE WIFE-BOUND HEROES SEEM MUCH MORE PLENTIFUL BUT I ENDED UP GETTING FOUR MECHANAL CONSTRUCTS AND MY BEST SCORE YET IT'S DEFINITELY GOT ME ITCHING FOR ONE OF THE BIGGER SETS BUT I'M FAR FROM EXHAUSTING THE PLAY I CAN GET OUT OF THIS BASE SET



TWO OR THREE TIMES A YEAR MAYBE MY FAMILY LIVE ABOUT SIX HOURS AWAY SO WE USUALLY ONLY GET TIME TOGETHER ON HOLIDAYS MY BROTHERS ARE VERY WILLING PARTICIPANTS HAVING HAD PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO CATAN MTG D D AND THAT SORT OF STUFF MY PARENTS I'VE YET TO ROPE IN BUT THIS YEAR'S CHRISTMAS INVITATION INCLUDED BRING THAT CAT GAME HAHAHAHA
EITHER SCOVILLE WHICH TOOK US UPWARDS OF AN HOUR AND A HALF OR A GAME OF QWIRKLE WITH MY AP PRONE FRIEND IT BEEN LONGER THAN MINUTES BUT IT FELT LIKE AN ETERNITY I'M A PLAY FOR FUN GAMER WHEREAS HE'S A MAXIMISE YOU SCORE GAMER I CONSTANTLY FELT LIKE SCREAMING JUST PUT DOWN A DAMN TILE
THIS WAS AN INSTANT BUY FOR ME AFTER I ORDERED I LOOKED AT BG AND WAS A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT IT GOT IT IN THE MAIL YESTERDAY PLAYED THE SOLO VERSION AND REALLY ENJOYED IT GLAD I WENT THROUGH WITH THE PURCHASE


I'VE REALLY ENJOYED IT IT REALLY IS PATCHWORK IT'S NICE THAT I CAN PLAY IT UP TO PLAYERS IT IS A LITTLE LIGHTER TO ME THAN PATCHWORK BECAUSE ITS FAR MORE FORGIVING LOTS OF FUN AND WORTH THE BUY
I WONDER WHEN THIS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE US I CAN'T FIND IT AVAILABLE FOR ANYWHERE
I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE IT WAS PATCHWORK WHICH I'D HEARD A LOT ABOUT BUT FOR MORE THAN 2 PLAYERS

I AM A BIT ANNOYED WITH THE STICKER SHEET THAT CAME WITH IT TO CORRECT THEIR ERRORS I DONT MIND SNICKERING THE RULEBOOK MORE ANNOYED ABOUT THE BOARD

I'M KINDA LOOKING FORWARD TO BUYING THIS BUT I THINK I'LL WAIT UNTIL THE FIRST REPRINT TO AVOID THE WHOLE STICKER GATE SITUATION
HOW DOES IT PLAY WITH 2 PLAYERS MY FIANCE LOVES GARDENING CATS AND GAMES SO THIS SEEMS LIKE A NATURAL ONE FOR OUR COLLECTION
APPARENTLY REVIEWS ARE UNWANTED HERE LOL
PROSPERITY AND SEASIDE ARE THE TWO BEST IMO I WOULD GO FOR SEASIDE IF ONLY GETTING ONE
INTRIGUE ADDS EXTRA TREASURE AND VP CARDS TO ALLOW PLAYER GAMES IF YOUR GROUP NEEDS THAT IT ALSO ADDS MORE INTERACTION BETWEEN PLAYERS IF YOU WANT IT TO BE A MORE INTERACTIVE TAKE THAT GAME
PROSPERITY AND SEASIDE ARE ALWAYS THE TOP 2 I WOULD ADD DARK AGES TO THIS BUT THAT'S JUST ME
SPACE HULK EH TOO BAD MY BOARD GAME BUDGET HAS BEEN OBLITERATED ALREADY
SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE MISINFORMED ON KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER THE MONSTERS THEY LINKED WERE NEVER ARE PROMO MINIATURES AND NOT PART OF THE GAME

AND DON'T GET ME WRONG ADM HAS ALWAYS HAD OVER SEXUALIZED WOMEN JUST NOT IN THE WAYS THEY DESCRIBED IN THE ARTICLE
I WISH A LITTLE MORE RESEARCH WOULD GO INTO ARTICLES ABOUT KINGDOM DEATH FULL DISCLOSURE I GOT IN ON THE FIRST KICKSTARTER AND I ENJOY THE GAME

FIRST THE FIRST RUN OF THE GAME FUNDED BY THE FIRST KICKSTARTER WAS FOR SALE ON THE KINGDOM DEATH WEB STORE AT GENION AND 2 COPIES WERE SOLD AT A RETAIL STORE SOMEWHERE ON THE WEST COAST I HAVE READ IT HAD A HIGH RETAIL PRICE BUT HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR LESS SINCE THE FIRST KICKSTARTER CLOSED IN THE FORM OF A NOW ON THE SECOND KICKSTARTER

SECOND THE CURRENT KICKSTARTER IS FOR A REPRINT OF THE CORE GAME PLUS SOME EXTRAS NOTHING HAS BEEN THE GAME JUST STARTED FUNDING AND MUCH OF THE SEXUAL CONTENT WAS ADD ON MATERIAL THAT WAS OPTIONAL AND WILL BE ADDED TO THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN AS IT IS REVEALED

THIRD TWO OF THE MONSTERS LINKED FORGE GOD AND WET NURSE WERE NOT INCLUDED ANYWHERE IN THE FIRST KICKSTARTER A GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH WAS DONE AND IMAGES FROM NON GAME MINIS OF WHICH KINGDOM DEATH HAS A BUNCH OF ARE BEING USED TO DESCRIBE THE KICKSTARTER OFFERINGS THE THIRD MONSTER LINKED IS THE CORM WHICH WAS AVAILABLE AS AN OPTIONAL EXPANSION THE FIRST TIME AROUND

FOURTH THE GAME DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO CUSTOMIZE A MINI WITH A DICK SKIRT THAT IMAGE IS FROM ANOTHER SO FAR MINI ONE OF THE SATAN TWINS THE SKIRT IS NOT A PIECE OF GEAR YOU CAN MAKE AND IS LIKELY NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE MINIS IN THE BOX WITHOUT SOME MODIFYING THE SATAN TWINS ARE RESIN MINIS THAT WERE DESIGNED AFTER THE FIRST KICKSTARTER

FIFTH THE LEVEL PLEDGE THIS ARTICLE STATES THAT YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE THIS IS ONLY KIND OF TRUE AS THE CURRENT KICKSTARTER IS FOR A REPRINT UPDATE OF A GAME I HAVE BEEN PLAYING FOR ABOUT A YEAR THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PLAYED THE GAME AND ARE INTERESTED IN AN UPDATED COPY ALONG WITH ALL THE EXTRAS THEY CAN GET IT IS NOT A COMPLETELY UNTESTED IDEA IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE GAME AS IT EXISTS NOW OR SEEN IT I PERSON YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA ABOUT THE GAME AND ITS PRODUCTION VALUE

IT LOOKS LIKE THE WRITERS OF THIS ARTICLE DIDN'T DO TOO MUCH RESEARCH OTHER THAN A GOOGLE SEARCH BEFORE WRITING IT I KNOW THAT THIS GAME HAS NUDITY AND SEXUAL THEMES IN IT BUT THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN THAT MUCH OF THE MORE GRAPHIC OVERT SEXUAL NATURE IN THE GAME IS IN OPTIONAL EXPANSIONS AND ADD ON PROMO MATERIAL THINGS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BASE GAME
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLAINING IN THE COMMENTS BUT I FOR ONE AM GLAD THERE'S BEEN A LOOK AT ADM FROM MUSD IT ALSO MENTIONS THE CORRECT DELIVERY DATE SUMMER NORMAL KS TURNAROUND FOR THE FIRST ROUND OF MATERIALS WHILE MAKING THE POINT THAT IN FOUR YEARS FOR THE CONTENT WHO KNOWS WHERE OR WHO WE'LL ALL BE WHOEVER IT IS THAT'S SENDING THEM A COPY THANK YOU SO MANY PEOPLE SIMPLY REACT TO THE EXISTENCE OF THIS GAME WITHOUT TRYING IT AND MUCH LIKE AIA IT'S A ONE-MAN DREAM PROJECT THAT'S GLORIOUS DESPITE ITS FLAWS

ADDITIONALLY DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT LESS THE MOST INSANE THINGS LIKE THE WET NURSE AND FORGE GOD WERE USUALLY PROMOS AND SO THAT THOSE WHO WANTED TO GO TO THAT EXTREME TOTALLY COULD AND THE CORE GAME WHILE STILL GROSS AND FULL OF DICKS AND TITS CAME ACROSS LESS LURID THE NEW KS SEEMS AIMED TO SHUT DOWN THE AFOREMENTIONED REACTIONS SEE KICKSTARTING SEXISM ONE OF THE FIRST GOOGLE RESULTS FOR ADM UP UNTIL RECENTLY BY AT LEAST SEXUALIZING MEN AND WOMEN FOR THE PIN UPS THE CORE BOOK STILL HAS SOME WEIRD SHIT IN IT AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE NIGHTMARE RAM PROBABLY TOMORROW CORE GAME STILL COMES WITH THE PHOENIX AND IT HAS A SCULPTED CLOACA COVERED IN BABY HANDS THAT CAN ACTUAL GRAB YOU AND PULL YOU IN I'D EXPECT LESS FORGE GOD LEVELS OF GRAPHIC BUT CERTAINLY CORM SUNSTALKER PHOENIX LEVELS IF ONE NEW MONSTER DOESN'T HAVE LIKE A WEIRD SCULPTED DICK I WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
ALSO SHOOTOUT FOR MENTIONING NOT ONLY ADM ONE OF MY KICKSTARTER BABIES BUT VAST ANOTHER LOVELY GAME THAT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT KICKSTARTER BOTH GAMES ARE FROM CREATORS AND HAVE NO MAJOR GAME COMPANIES BEHIND THEM ALTHOUGH ORIGINALLY ADM GOT SOME HELP FROM CMON AND STUDIO MCVEY WHEN THEY WERE BOTH MUCH SMALLER ENTITIES AND WOULDN'T EXIST WITHOUT KS BACKERS ALSO BOTH GAMES ARE GREAT ALTHOUGH SEVEN ROLES FOR VAST WOWS STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FROM PATRICK LEDER AND THE FORBIDDEN STARS GUY HELL WORKING ON LIKE THREE GAMES AT THE MOMENT AND I'M HYPED FOR ALL OF THEM
GOING TO TRY TO NARROW IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT TO PUT YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHAT KIND OF GAME ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

FUN AND CASUAL HOLIDAY STUFF WITH FAMILY
TACTICAL
WARGAME AREA CONTROL
WORKER PLACEMENT
HEAVY MEDIUM LIGHT GAME
DURATION
NUMBER OF PLAYERS
PLAYER INTERACTION

LIGHT EURO WITH WORKER PLACEMENT

STONE AGE

BETRAYAL BLUFF

AVALON
SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM

IF YOU WANT STRAIGHT UP BETRAYAL GO FOR AVALON BUT A MORE NEGOTIATION ORIENTED GAME GET SON

IF YOU WANT A LONGER AND HEAVIER BETRAYAL COOP GAME WITH A BIT MORE DEPTH GO FOR DEAD OF WINTER BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA OR DARK MOON

2 PLAYER GAME

STAR REALMS

CHEAP AND GOOD DECKBUILDER

AREA CONTROL DUDES ON A MAP

LIGHT MINUTE EMPIRES LEGENDS

JUST CONTROL MORE OF THE MAP TO WIN

HEAVIER CYCLADES VERY COOL BIDDING GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO BID ON THE GODS FAVOURS TO PURCHASE ARDYS AND MOVE YOUR BOATS AND STUFF IF YOU LIKE BIDDING AUCTION GAMES I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND RA IT'S A BLAST

CARD DRAFTING GAMES

SUSHI GO OR WONDERS

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING HEAVIER MAYBE SEASONS IS FOR YOU

I RECENTLY PLAYED A PRETTY NEAT LITTLE SET COLLECTING GAME CALLED ARCHAEOLOGY THE NEW EXPEDITION IT WAS PRETTY FUN AND VERY EASY TO LEARN
I WAS DEBATING ON PLEDGING FOR SD L AS MY FOR A LIGHT DUNGEON CRAWL AND FOUND JOKAI QUEST ON KS ALONG THE WAY MIGHT WANT TO CHECK THAT OUT I DECIDED IN THE END TO TAKE A GAMBLE ON IT AS IT LOOKS PROMISING
I BACKED THE LEGENDARY PLEDGE FOR SD L BUT THEIR CONSTANT RULES UPDATES AND LACK OF ANY REVEALS OF HOW LEGENDS WILL ACTUALLY WORK MADE ME CANCEL MY PLEDGE ENDED UP BACKING MASSIVE DARKNESS AS MY EASY-GOING DUNGEON CRAWLER GAME
IF I HAD THE MONEY AND THE SPACE I WOULD GO FOR KD M

I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE EVER PLAYED SD BUT I THINK IT'S THE WEAKER OF THE TWO
I BROUGHT SD ON THE CHEAP TO PAINT AND FOR THE DUNGEON CRAWLING EXPERIENCE SADLY THE GAME FELL FLAT WITH MY FRIENDS AND WIFE IT WAS TOO BASIC AND THE GAMES GO ON AND ON AND ON WHAT YOU SEE IN THE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF GAMEPLAY JUST REPEATS A LOT IT'S GREAT FOR A GAUNTLET STYLE KILL THE BADDIES AND LOOT UP BUT THAT'S BASICALLY IT

I UNDERSTAND LEGENDS WILL BRING A CAMPAIGN BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT WILL BRING ANYTHING BETTER TO THE TABLE COMPARED TO KD M OR OTHER GREAT CAMPAIGN RPG GAMES OUT THERE LIKE DECENT STAR WARS IA ELDRITCH HORROR MOMV 2 ETC

SD EVEN WITH A CAMPAIGN I THINK THE BASIC HACK N SLASH MECHANICS AND THE RINSE REPEAT OF BADDIES WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE BEST DUNGEON ROLE PLAYING EXPERIENCE


NOT THAT USEFUL SORRY
WHAT IS SD L EXACTLY
ANY CHANCE YOU COULD COORDINATE A PM WITH ME IF YOU DECIDE TO CANCEL THE ADM PLEDGE WOULD LOVE TO SAVE BUCKS GRABBING AN OPEN SPOT LOL
I REALLY WISH I COULD JUSTIFY PULLING THE TRIGGER ON THIS FOR MYSTERIUM BUT WE'VE ALREADY GOT BOARD GAMES WRAPPED FOR CHRISTMAS

EDIT MY WIFE DOES NOT APPRECIATE ENCOURAGEMENT
WOW GREAT DEAL ON MANSIONS OF MADNESS WITH THIS
THANK YOU JUST GOT FURY OF DRACULA FOR
THANKS FOR THE HEADS-UP THIS IS AN ACTUAL REALLY GOOD SALE UNLIKE MOST OF THE CYBER MONDAY NONSENSE I'VE SEEN TODAY

I PICKED UP HARRY POTTER HOGWARTS BATTLE FOR JUST OVER CONSIDERING GOING BACK IN UNDER A DIFFERENT EMAIL FOR ANOTHER GAME
BNCYBER
I WISH THE B N WEBSITE WASN'T SO TERRIBLE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND JUST BOARDGAMES WITH GETTING ALL THE KIDS TOY JUNK
I THOUGHT THE ALREADY EXPIRED

EDIT GOT IT MOBILE SITE IS JUST TRASH
THANKS PICKED UP MANSION OF MADNESS
THIS IS AN AMAZING DEAL
THE APPLIES AUTOMATICALLY TO GAMES IF YOU WANT MULTIPLE THEN OPEN AN INCOGNITO TAB AFTER THE FIRST MY SECOND ORDER WAS GIVING ME TROUBLE
I GOT IMPERIAL ASSAULT AND TIME STORIES
I ALSO THINK YOU CAN ADD AN EXTRA PERCENT OFF WITH BN MEMBERSHIP

SAVED THANK YOU
THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP
YOU CAN GET TICKET TO RIDE RAILS AND SAILS FOR LESS THAN WITH THIS COMBO COMPARED TO AT CSI
DAMN I WAS HOPING THEY'D HAVE CONCEPT SO I COULD PICK IT UP A BIT CHEAPER FOR CHRISTMAS THIS IS A GREAT DEAL THOUGH
SIGH FINE ORDERED FURY OF DRACULA I HAVE OTHER GAMES SITTING IN PLASTIC AND I KEEP ORDERING MORE
JUST PICKED UP TIME STORIES FOR
ALSO SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE IS OFF SO WITH ALL THOSE COUPONS IT WOULD BE WELL BELOW FOR A FANTASTIC REGULARLY GAME
FIRST GAME WILL BE MINIMUM 2 HOURS INCLUDING LEARNING HOW TO PLAY AFTER THAT YOU CAN SPEED IT UP BUT THAT'S ONLY WITH THE SHORT SCENARIOS
THERE ARE SHORT MEDIUM AND LONG SCENARIO CARDS INCLUDED DOUBLE-SIDED AS I THINK ONE SIDE IS SUPPOSED TO BE HARDER THAN THE OTHER I THINK AFTER YOU GET A FEW GAMES UNDER YOUR BELT IF YOU STICK TO THE SHORT SCENARIOS AND IF YOU SET EVERYTHING UP BEFORE EVERYONE ARRIVES YOU CAN GET YOUR PLAY TIME DOWN TO UNDER AN HOUR IT'S ALL DEPENDENT ON HOW THE PEOPLE PLAY THOUGH IF PEOPLE TAKE A LONG TIME TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO THEN IT'S NATURALLY GOING TO TAKE LONGER ANYHOW I THINK WE USUALLY TAKE ABOUT MINUTES FOR A PLAYER GAME IT'S SO GOOD THOUGH IT'S WORTH IT THE GAME DOESN'T EVER FEEL LIKE IT OVERSTAYS ITS WELCOME TO ME BUT WE ALSO STICK MOSTLY TO THE SHORT SCENARIOS
SETUP TAKES A LITTLE LONGER THAN I'D LIKE BUT IT FINISHES IN A BIT OVER AN HOUR FOR OF US

MORE PEOPLE WOULD TAKE LONGER THOUGH AS WILL YOUR FIRST PLAY THROUGH
YEAH THAT IS INDEED SOME WILDLY VARIABLE PLAY TIMES THEN AGAIN THERE ARE SCENARIOS CIRC WHICH WILL DEFINITELY INCREASE DECREASE PLAYTIME

THE SINGLE TIME I'VE PLAYED DEAD OF WINTER WE WERE ANNIHILATED IN UNDER AN HOUR AND WERE PRETTY DEMORALIZED AFTERWARDS PERHAPS SHALL BRING IT OUT AGAIN SOON BUT WHEW BRUTAL
THE GAME IS A BEAR WITH ALL THE LITTLE RULES BUT IF ONE PERSON KNOWS THEM ALL AND IS A COMPETENT TEACHER IT IS FINE
I STARTED A GAME OF THE LONG NIGHT PM FINISHED AT S THE WAY THROUGH THE BANDIT BLITZ SCENARIO SO MUCH QUARTERBACKING FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A FAIRLY HARD TO DETECT INSEA BETRAYAL
IN THE GAME GROUP I USUALLY PLAY WITH IT OUR PLAYTIME IS AROUND HOURS FOR SHORT SCENARIOS BUT WE PLAY AS OR PLAYERS AND USUALLY THERE IS AT LEAST ONE NEW PLAYER
A LOT ALWAYS I THINK THREE HOURS AND A HALF AVERAGE BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO TEACH SOMEONE HOW TO PLAY

OF COURSE THAT COULD BE CUT TO AN HOUR AND A HALF IF WE TRIED TO PLAY FAST I USUALLY ONLY PUT IT ON THE TABLE WHEN EVERYONE HAS AT LEAST THREE HOURS TO PLAY SO WE PREFER TO TAKE OUR TIME I GUESS
A LOT OF THE PLAY TIME IS THE META GAME THAT GOES ON AROUND THE MAIN GAME DISCUSSIONS NEGOTIATIONS PLEADING ETC IF YOU HAVE A VOCAL GROUP WHO LIKE TO TALK THEN YOU CAN BE LOOKING AT 2 HOURS

A QUIET AND EFFECTIVE GROUP WHO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING YOU COULD BLAST THROUGH A LONG SCENARIO EASILY IN UNDER HOURS

THROW A TRAITOR INTO THE MIX THOUGH AND ALL HECK BREAKS LOOSE THAT'S WHEN THE DEDUCTIONS AND CONFRONTATIONS HAPPEN ONE OF THE KEY PARTS OF THE GAME AND THE GAME COMES ALIVE FOR BOTH THE BETRAYER AND THE BETRAYED

IT'S A CRACKING GAME AND YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD MAKE TIME FOR IT BUT GIVEN YOUR TIME LIMITS I WOULDN'T EXPECT IT TO FIT WITH YOUR PLAYTIMES
EVEN THE SHORT SCENARIOS TOOK MINIMUM 2 HOURS FOR US
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL GET DONE IN AN HOUR ESPECIALLY YOUR FIRST GO AT IT WE'VE TAKEN AROUND TWO HOURS EVERY TIME THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE SET UP TIME AT THE FRONT END WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT IT'S A GREAT GAME AND I AGREE THAT IT'S WORTH THE TIME EFFORT INVESTMENT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF YOUR MAIN EVENT TYPES OF GAMES
MINUTES
IT TOOK HOURS FOR PEOPLE PLAYING A MEDIUM LENGTH SCENARIO
THAT THE SCREENSHOT INCLUDES THE WORD STOPWATCH BROKEN INTO TWO LINES BOTHERED ME MORE THAN IT SHOULD
WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DICE ROLLER AND THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR ARE THE DICE LIMITED TO ONLY SIDED THAT'S ALL I SAW IN THE PICTURE AND IF SO THAT'S KIND OF DISAPPOINTING
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY THANKS
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT I CHECKED THEIR SITE LAST WEEK AND THEY HAD AN ENTIRE FAQ PAGE DEVOTED TO TELLING PEOPLE THAT THINGS WERE OK I'M ASSUMING ORDERS ARE JUST BEING FULFILLED SLOWLY
AS LONG AS THEY SHOW UP BEFORE THE END OF DECEMBER I'M GOOD
THE SITE IS STILL THERE IT'S JUST NOT ADVERTISED ON THE MAIN PAGE CHECK OUT THE FAQ FOR INFO ABOUT SHIPPING

TL R THEY'RE BEING SLOW ABOUT SHIPPING BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME OF ORDERS YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN A CONFIRMATION EMAIL WITH YOUR ORDER NUMBER IN IT YOU CAN CONTACT THEM ABOUT IT IF YOU THINK SOMETHING SCREWY HAPPENED
I BELIEVE IT WAS MENTIONED ELSEWHERE ON HERE THAT THEIR FIRST BATCH OF SHIPPING WOULD BE GOING OUT AT SOME POINT TODAY I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY JUST WENT WITH AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM AND GAVE EVERYONE THE VACATION OFF OTHER THAN A FEW TECHIES ON CALL
I SPOKE WITH SOMEONE YESTERDAY AND YEAH SHIPPING WAS SUPPOSED TO START I WAS TOLD MY ORDER WAS PREPARED AND WAITING IN THE WAREHOUSE TO BE PICKED UP BY SHIPPING PARTNER I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN A SHIPPING EMAIL YET BUT A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH IN YEARS PAST FOUND THAT THAT IS AN AUTOMATED EMAIL AND SEVERAL PEOPLE GOT PACKAGES BEFORE THE SHIPPING EMAIL WAS SENT
I LOVE THE GAME I'VE NEVER WON IT BUT THE FIVE PLAYS I HAVE WERE ALL TENSE STRATEGIC STRUGGLES DEFINITELY WORKS BEST WITH THE FULL SIX PLAYERS THOUGH
I HAVE IT AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ENOUGH PEOPLE TO PLAY YET BUT I THINK IT LOOKS PRETTY SWEET A LOT OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FROM WHAT I CAN TELL ARE UNDULY INFLUENCED BY THE FACT THAT IT ISN'T SET IN THE DUNE UNIVERSE THE RULE SET IS AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE OLD DUNE BOARD GAME BUT WITHOUT THE DUNE LICENSE WITHOUT AN ATTACHMENT TO DUNE I'M NOT BOTHERED

BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN PLAYED IT SO WHAT DO I KNOW
IT'S MY FAVORITE GAME I LOVE HOW INTENSE THE DIPLOMACY GETS ALONG WITH THE HARD CODED ALLIANCE SYSTEM BUT IT'S GREATEST DISADVANTAGE IS YOU NEED AT LEAST FOUR TO REALLY GET A GOOD GAME AND AN AWKWARD FIVE FOR THE GREATEST GAME MY GROUP TENDS TO EITHER BE THREE PEOPLE AVAILABLE OR EIGHT NEVER ANYTHING IN BETWEEN THE ONLY THING THAT MADE IT BETTER IS IF THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE ORIGINAL DUNE LICENSE WHEN WE PLAY WE STILL USE THE DUNE FACTION NAMES WELL ENJOY YOUR TIME WITH IT I REALLY WANT TO PLAY NOW
YOU'RE IN LUCK CRY HAVOC GRANT RODIE JUST PUBLISHED THE FIRST ISSUE OF HIS GAMES MAGAZINE QUAGMIRE TALKING ABOUT NOTHING BUT REX

BLOG REX
I HAVE ONLY PLAYED IT ONE TIME ABOUT A YEAR AGO BUT I REMEMBER REALLY ENJOYING IT AND WAS ITCHING TO TRY IT AGAIN I JOTTED A FEW NOTES DOWN ON BG AFTER OUR PLAY

WE WERE ALL FIRST TIME PLAYERS IT TOOK US AN HOUR TO SET UP AND LEARN THE RULES ACCORDING TO MY NOTES IT WAS EASY AND INTUITIVE TO PLAY ONCE WE GOT GOING WE PLAYED WITH PEOPLE AND IT QUICKLY EVOLVED INTO A WHICH WASN'T REALLY A BAD THING IT WAS A FAIRLY INTERESTING GAME WITH WITH ALL THE UNIQUE RACE POWERS I WROTE THAT OR PLAYERS WOULD PROBABLY BE PREFERRED IN THE FUTURE I REMEMBER IT BEING A VERY POLITICAL GAME WHICH SUITS OUR GROUP GREAT

WE ALMOST PLAYED IT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO BUT RAN OUT OF TIME IN THE EVENING HOPEFULLY WE WILL PLAY AGAIN SOON THOUGH I LIKE THE GAME A LOT
IT'S A REALLY GOOD GAME IT'S A OF DUNE SET IN THE TWILIGHT IMPERIUM UNIVERSE IT ALSO FIXES ISSUES IN THE ORIGINAL GAME

THE MAIN GRIPE PEOPLE HAVE WITH THIS GAME IS THAT IT'S NOT DUNE THEMED ANY MORE WHICH CAN'T REALLY BE HELPED BECAUSE NOBODY IS GETTING THAT LICENSE BACK
DISCLAIMER PLAYED IT ONCE

THE IMPRESSION THE GAME LEFT ON ME WAS THAT IT IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT UPON FULL INTERNALIZATION OF THE RULE SET TO EVEN FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT DOUCHEBAGGERY IT'S NOT A GAME YOU CAN BULLSHIT YOUR WAY THROUGH AND FOR THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A VERY INTO IT GROUP I FEEL

I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO GIVE IT ANOTHER GO BUT LEARNING IT WAS A SLOG AND I FIND MYSELF WONDERING IF OTHER GAMES IN MY COLLECTION MAY SCRATCH THAT PROVERBIAL ITCH THOUGHTS
I'VE ONLY PLAYED IT TWICE ONCE WITH AND ONCE WITH IT'S PROBABLY BEST WITH OR SINCE YOU THEN WON'T HAVE UNEQUAL ALLIANCES ALTHOUGH THAT MIGHT NOT BE A HUGE ISSUE I PERSONALLY QUITE LIKE IT IT'S PRETTY AND IT TOOK US A LONG TIME TO PLAY BOTH TIMES BUT IT HAS A LOT OF COOL AND INTERESTING MECHANICS I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN HAVE ACTUAL ALLIANCES INSTEAD OF THE YOU HAVE IN A LOT OF OTHER STRATEGY GAMES

BOTH GAMES WE DID KIND OF HAVE AN UNDERDOG TEAM THOUGH ESPECIALLY THE SECOND TIME AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF FUN FIGHTING JUST TO MAKE SURE WE BARELY DIDN'T WIN EVERY SINGLE ROUND WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT TWO PLAYERS SMASHED THEIR ARMIES TOGETHER THE TURN BEFORE ALLIANCES WERE MADE WHICH MEANT THERE WERE THREE OF US WHO COULD MAKE A STRONG ALLIANCE OPPOSED BY TWO WEAK PLAYERS AND A THIRD PLAYER WHO KIND OF FOOLED AROUND

WAS IT KIND OF THEIR OWN FAULT I SUPPOSE BUT I'D WARN YOU THAT BECAUSE OF THE COMBAT SYSTEM MAKING IT SO EASY TO LOSE A TON OF UNITS REALLY QUICKLY AND HOW PRECIOUS RESOURCES CAN BE IT'S EASY TO SCREW YOURSELF OVER HARD IN ONE FATAL MOVE
I USED TO HAVE IT IT'S A GOOD GAME BUT A FEW THINGS KEPT ME FROM PLAYING IT OFTEN I'VE GOT A FEW OTHER CLEVER BATTLE GAMES AND LIMITED CHANCES TO PLAY WITH A GROUP THAT REALLY APPRECIATES THAT TYPE OF GAME SO IT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD IS MY FAVORITE OF THOSE CYCLADES A CLOSE SECOND

I WASN'T PLAYING IT BECAUSE

IT'S LONG LONGER THAN OTHER SIMILAR GAMES AND THAT MAKES IT HARDER TO PLAY

IT'S HARD TO GET NEW PLAYERS UP TO SPEED NOT IN TERMS OF RULES BUT IN TERMS OF FUN YOU CAN PLAY BADLY IN CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD AND STILL FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING STUFF IF YOU PLAY BADLY IN REX YOU CAN PAINT YOURSELF INTO A CORNER WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE NO CONTROL

THE BATTLES ARE VERY BRITTLE LOSING A BATTLE HURTS A LOT SOME PEOPLE LIKE THAT BUT ADD IN THE SIMULTANEOUS SELECTION PART OF THE BATTLE AND IT FEELS JUST NOT QUITE ENOUGH UNDER YOUR CONTROL LOSING FEELS BAD AND WINNING DOESN'T FEEL SATISFYING

THAT SAID I LOVE THE FACTIONS AND I LOVE THE ALLIANCE SYSTEM SOMEONE SHOULD USE THAT ALLIANCE SYSTEM IN A MINUTE GAME THAT WOULD BE GREAT

IT'S AN ODD TIE IN TO TWILIGHT IMPERIUM AND LIKE OTHERS HAVE SAID IT'S A RESKIN SO IT'S STRANGE ALL AROUND

IT'S VERY ASYMMETRICAL IN SOME CASES IT'S MADE UP FOR THE TURTLES ARE VERY WEAK BUT HAVE A PRETTY COOL BONUS WIN CONDITION OTHERS HOWEVER ARE JUST WORSE OVERALL WITH NO REAL BALANCE MECHANIC TO MAKE UP FOR IT

IT'S FUN DOES UNIQUE AND INTERESTING THINGS BUT CAN AND WILL LEAVE YOU FEELING LIKE YOU LOST BECAUSE THE GAME ITSELF WAS FLAWED
I DEMODE THIS GAME SEVERAL TIMES AND IT SEEMED TO ALWAYS END ON TURN 2 OR TURN KEEP THAT IN MIND BENE GESSERIT ERR SPACE TURTLE PLAYERS
PLAYED IT ONCE AND I LOVED IT IT HAS A BRILLIANT ALLIANCE MECHANISM THAT DOES A FANTASTIC JOB OF ENCOURAGING NEGOTIATION AND AGGRESSIVE PLAY

IN REX YOU CAN ALLY WITH A PLAYER AND SHARE A VICTORY WHICH MEANS BEGGING THE DOMINANT PLAYER FOR AN ALLIANCE IN AN AVERAGE AREA CONTROL GAME GETTING AN EARLY LEAD IS POINTLESS BECAUSE OTHER PLAYERS WILL TEAM UP AGAINST YOU



I LOVE THE ORIGINAL DUNE WHICH REX REIMPLEMENT BUT COULD NEVER GET MY HANDS ON A COPY REX NEATLY FILLS IN THE HOLE LEFT BY NOT OWNING DUNE

I'VE PLAYED THE GAME A LOT AND STILL REALLY ENJOY IT THINK MY GAME GROUPS AREN'T AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS I AM BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN I MANAGE TO WEAR THEM DOWN
THAT'S FUNNY I BOUGHT THIS GAME ON A WHIM IN A CLEARANCE SALE IT COSTED ME OR IN FACT I BOUGHT THAT DAY GAMES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE OF THEM

I PUT IT ON A SHELF UNTOUCHED STILL IN WRAP

THE COMMENTS MAKE ME WANT TO UNWRAP IT JUST NOW BUT I'M NOT AT HOME RIGHT NOW AAAARGH
IT'S GOOD BUT SHOWING IT'S AGE

WE ONLY GOT TO PLAY IT ONCE AND HAD FUN BUT THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH IT

THE BOARD FELT VERY BARREN AS MONEY INFLUENCE WAS GOBBLED UP VERY QUICKLY AND BATTLES WERE LIMITED TO
THE AUCTIONS TOOK TOO LONG AND WERE VERY EXHAUSTING WE'LL HOUSE RULE THEM TO SIMULTANEOUS AUCTIONS NEXT GAME
ALLIANCES WERE VERY POWERFUL WE'VE PLAYED A PLAYER GAME AND WITH THE FIRST NEGOTIATIONS CARD DRAWN WE'VE FORMED A PLAYER ALLIANCE A 2 PLAYER ALLIANCE AND ONE PLAYER STAYED SOLO WE THE PLAYER ALLIANCE THE OTHER PLAYERS FROM THAT POINT ONWARD CONTROLLING ALL THE AUCTIONS AND MURDERING THE OPPOSITION WITH EASE IT WAS JUST VERY EASY ONCE THE ALLIANCES WERE FORMED AND SINCE NO OTHER NEGOTIATION CARD CAME UP WE'VE STUCK TO THEM
THERE'S INCENTIVE TO ACTUALLY USE TREASON CARDS AS YOU'VE ALREADY WON THE GAME AT THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN DO IT AND IT GAINS YOU NOTHING OTHER THAN THE TITLE

SO WHILE WE'VE ENJOYED IT WE COULDN'T REALLY GET IT TO THE TABLE EVER SINCE SINCE IT WAS PROBLEMATIC AND MIDDLING AND WE HAVE BETTER GAMES
THEY USED GAMECRAFTER IT'S A FUN WAY TO GET A GAME PROFESSIONALLY MADE BUT AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS GAME NOT REALLY THE MOST ECONOMICAL YOU END UP PAYING RETAIL PRICES FOR ALL OF YOUR PIECES WHICH MAKES EVEN SIMPLE GAMES COST
I PLAYED OH MY LAIR AND I LOVE IT
R TABLETOPGAMEDESIGN USUALLY HAS LOTS OF TIPS FOR THIS
BBB GOING TO FIND THAT UNPOPULAR BOARD GAME OPINIONS THREAD

STOP PUTTING KNIGHTS IN THE BAG I WANT SCHOLARS
EXCELLENT MECHANIC IN THIS AWESOME GAME
WOW THERE IS SOME REAL MEAT IN THIS REVIEW I DIDN'T READ IT ALL BUT IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE THEY PUT SOME EFFORT INTO THIS
SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE IS A CARD GAME SET IN THE SAME UNIVERSE OF SHADOWRUN A FUTURISTIC SCI-FI RPG CROSSFIRE IS A COMPLETE PACKAGE ON ITS OWN WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO PLAY THE GAME FOR PLAYERS THERE IS ONE EXPANSION OUT FOR IT BUT IT JUST PROVIDES YOU WITH NEW MISSIONS AND CHARACTERS IF YOU WANT SOMETHING NEW AFTER PLAYING WITH THE BASE GAME
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MY TYPE OF GAME IF IT'S THIS CONFUSING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE TO PICK THEN I'M OUT LOL

I SO BADLY WANT A COOP GAME TO PLAY LIKE A DUNGEON CRAWLER BUT I DON'T WANT A DM I WANT EVERYONE TO PLAY ON THE SAME LEVEL
SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE CAN BE AN EXCEEDINGLY TEDIOUS GAME WATCH SOME REVIEW VIDEOS TO SEE IF IT'S UP YOUR ALLY I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED
ASK FOR THE 5TH EDITION RULEBOOK THE MASTER INDEX EDITION BEING THE CURRENT VERSION READ THAT TO GET STARTED

AND DOWNLOAD THE ACOLOGY PODCAST
APPLES TO APPLES I'M DONE THANKS WHILE THE COMBINATIONS AND JOKES ARE NEW THEY SOMEHOW FEEL THE SAME TO ME
MUNCHKIN ANY VAGIENT

AFTER A TIME YOU GO THROUGH ALL PERMUTATIONS OF MECHANICS AND THEN ITS JUST DULL STRATEGIES DEALING WITH LUCK OF THE DRAW

NOT TO MENTION ITS ABOUT MINUTES OF FUN BUILD UP WITH AN HOUR OF DULL HIGH LEVEL SUDDEN DEATH WHICH SHOULD BE AN OXYMORON
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY
THE USUAL SUSPECTS MONOPOLY AND RISK BUT I HAVEN'T PLAYED THEM IN MORE THAN YEARS
YEARS AGO I WAS INTRODUCING BOARD GAMES TO SOME FRIENDS AND BASED ON THEIR GAMING EXPERIENCE DOMINION WAS A GREAT START THAT ENDED UP BEING THE ONLY GAME THEY WANTED TO PLAY AND I BURNT OUT ON THE GAME BECAUSE OF IT GREAT GAME BUT I THINK I'M RETIRED
MAGIC THE GATHERING AND BY EXTENSION ANY AND EVERY TCG OR CG

I STARTED PLAYING M TG IN DURING MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL I GOT INTO AND OUT OF THE GAME TWICE BEFORE GETTING A JOB A ROTC IN WHEN I LEFT ROTC IN IN I TRIED TO CONTINUE PLAYING BUT LOST ALL INTEREST AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHILE WORKING THERE JUST HOW RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE IT IS I SOLD MY COLLECTION FOR THE FINAL TIME IN AND REFUSE TO PLAY ANY SORT OF CARD GAME
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU WITH SETTLERS OF CATAN THE GAME IS SO DEPENDENT ON THE INITIAL SETTLEMENT CHOOSING LOCATIONS THAT YOU CAN BE COMPLETELY SHAFTED FROM THAT POINT ONWARDS I ALSO HATE THE FACT THAT IT CAN BE YOUR TURN AND HAVE VIRTUALLY NOTHING AVAILABLE TO DO BECAUSE OF ROLLS SETTLERS WAS PROBABLY MY GATEWAY GAME BUT IT'S A GAME I DEFINITELY DON'T LOOK FORWARD TO PLAYING ANYMORE IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I LOVED PLAYING IT AT FIRST AND I THOUGHT HOW UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT THE GAME IS BUT THEN YOU GET INTO THE HOBBY AND APPRECIATE OTHER GAME MECHANICS
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY LUDO AND MONOPOLY I JUST HOPE NOBODY GIFTS ME A DIFFERENT VERSION OF MONOPOLY THIS YEAR

EDIT SORRY TO LUDO
SMALL WORLD AND LEGENDARY MARVEL I'VE PLAYED IT AS MUCH AS I HAVE BECAUSE AT THE TIME WE DID NOT HAVE MANY GAMES AND PEOPLE MOSTLY ENJOYED THEM


I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT THEM ANYMORE
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY IN A NUTSHELL

DRAW A BUNCH OF CARDS WHERE NOT EVERYONE IN YOUR GROUP GETS WHATEVER IS REFERENCED

2 HOLD ONTO THESE CARDS TO USE ON THROWAWAY ROUNDS AKA ROUNDS WHERE YOU HAVE NOTHING AND EXPECT FAILURE

REALIZE THAT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS IT MIGHT BE YOU IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AT CREATIVE WORDPLAY

HALF HEARTEDLY EXIST FOR OF THE GAME WHILE WAITING FOR GLIMMERS OF COMEDY


IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD GAME IF YOU WANT A GAME LIKE THAT THEN SUPERTIGHT IS A BETTER OPTION IT AT LEAST ALLOWS YOU A CHANCE TO BUILD UP AND ARGUE THE COMEDY OF AN OTHERWISE LAME COMBO

CH LACKS THAT OPTION BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WINNING THEN YOURS WON'T BE CHOSEN OUT OF SPITE IF YOU CHEERLEAD IT JUST LACKS POLISH
LOVE LETTER JAIPUR AND SPLENDOR ALL FOR THE SAME REASON AT THIS POINT IT'S JUST MECHANICAL AND LUCK OF THE DRAW WE'RE AS GOOD AS WE'RE EVER GOING TO BE AT THE GAME

UNPOPULARLY CODENAMES THE DOWNTIME IS KILLER FOR ME
CH

I'M JUST SO SICK OF IT NOW IT LACKS DEPTH OR REPLAY VALUE I JUST CANNOT STAND IT ANYMORE I DON'T DISLIKE PEOPLE WHO LIKE IT OR ANYTHING IT JUST FEELS SO SHALLOW TO ME I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE IT PEOPLE HAVE TO FORCE THEMSELVES TO LAUGH AT IT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NOT THAT FUNNY MOST OF THE TIME

IT'S JUST A BLAND GAME AFTER THE SECOND PLAY AND DESPITE THAT IT STILL ALWAYS COMES OUT WHAT DOES ANNOY ME IS WHEN CH GETS PLAYED OVER OTHER GAMES AS AN EXAMPLE I BOUGHT RESISTANCE AVALON IT'S STILL HASN'T BEEN PLAYED AND AT THIS POINT I NOW REALIZE IT PROBABLY NEVER WILL BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO PLAY IT AND INSTEAD SLUMP BACK TO CH
MACHI BORO
SMASH UP THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO COMBOS THEIR CARDS ENDLESSLY AND TAKES FOREVER OPTIMIZING THEIR TURN AND TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF ALL OF THE CARD INTERACTIONS IS TEDIOUS

THE GAME WOULD BE MORE FUN IF THE GROUP WOULD JUST LAY DOWN A CARD AND NOT BE SO CONCERNED WITH SCORING EVERY POSSIBLE CARD BUT AS IT STANDS IT'S JUST A SLOG
JUST SOME OLD GAMES WHICH I PLAYED BEFORE KNOWING OF OTHERS MONOPOLY RISK SETTLERS ETC

ALSO MANY SHORT GAMES I COULDN'T CARE LESS FOR LIKE LOVE LETTER BUT IF I HAVE TO PLAY THIS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE IT IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL


REVERSI OTHELLO SIMPLER THAN THE OTHER GAMES ALREADY MENTIONED AND THAT WAS ITS FINAL DOWNFALL MY WIFE AND I FIGURED OUT THE MOVE THAT MEANT YOU WON AND IT WAS INEVITABLE FROM THAT POINT ON IT TOOK US A WHILE BUT ONCE WE GOT THERE IT WAS OVER
RED DRAGON INN

IT'S DECENT ENOUGH AS A LIGHT GAME BUT MY GROUP LOVED IT SO MUCH AND ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT MAKES ME SICK JUST TO LOOK AT THE BOX
SECRET HITLER IT WAS BACK WHEN I'M STILL VERY NEW TO THE HOBBY AND PLAY A BUNCH OF IT SLOWLY I REALIZED HOW BAD I AM AT LYING
COUP

IT'S AN OK GAME TO PLAY MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE BUT MY GROUP DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO JUST STOP AFTER THAT AFTER TWO HOURS OF IT YOU JUST GET WAY PAST BURNT OUT THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH MEAT TO THE GAME NOR CLEVERNESS TO KEEP ME INTO IT
OP HERE FROM THE OTHER THREAD THIS LIST IS JUST AS HELPFUL IN HELPING ME DECIDE ON A NEW GAME SO I DECIDED TO KEEP AN UPDATED LIST OF THE MOST MENTIONED ONES HERE MINIMUM MENTIONS HOPE IT HELPS SOMEONE DECIDE ON OR AGAINST A GAME IN THE FUTURE


CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY

CATAN

MONOPOLY

DOMINION

RISK

TICKET TO RIDE

MAGIC

THE RESISTANCE

BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL

MUNCHKIN

SPLENDOR
HAVE YOU PLAYED STARFARERS OF CATAN OP

IF YOU HAVE NOT AND SOMEBODY SUGGEST PLAYING IT AND HAPPENS TO HAVE A COPY OF IT I IMPLORE YOU TO NOT LET THAT CATAN NAME FOOL YOU AND PLAY THIS GAME

IT'S NOWHERE NEAR THE BEST GAME OUT THERE BUT I PROMISE YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST
I'LL PROBABLY END UP PLAYING IT AGAIN BECAUSE MY GROUP LOVES IT BUT AFTER ABOUT PLAYS I'D BE OK WITH NOT PLAYING SPLENDOR AGAIN
I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT I NEVER WANT TO PLAY COSMIC ENCOUNTER AGAIN SINCE I CAN ENJOY IT A BIT AS A WACKY ACTIVITY WITH GOOD PEOPLE AND I DON'T WANT TO DENY THE EXPERIENCE TO FRIENDS WHO LOVE IT I DO THINK IT'S THE MOST OVERRATED GAME THERE IS RIGHT NOW A OR GAME THAT IS ON MANY AMAZING REVIEWERS TOP GAMES I'VE ALSO PLAYED IT OVER TIMES THOUGH SO UNLIKE OTHER GAMES THAT I MIGHT CALL OVERRATED I'M PRETTY SURE MY OPINION ISN'T ROOTED IN IGNORANCE OF THE GAME WHEN COSMIC LOVERS TALK ABOUT THE GREAT TACTICS THAT HATERS MUST NOT ROK I ROK THEM EVERY SINGLE TIME AND JUST DON'T THINK THESE ARE GENERALLY GOOD FEATURES OF A GAME
PUZZLE STRIKE I GOT THE FIRST EDITION AS A GIFT FOR THE FIRST COUPLE GAMES I THINK WE PROBABLY PLAYED IT AS THE DESIGNERS INTENDED PICKING RANDOM CHARACTERS AND BUYING A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING AND DOING OK BUT AFTER SEVERAL GAMES WE REALIZED ALL OF THE ACTION CHIPS WERE JUST DREADFUL YOU WIN BY BUYING BASIC ATTACKS AND MONEY AND ARGAGARG IS CRAZY UNBEATABLE

NOW I'D PLAYED DOMINION WHICH GOES THROUGH A SIMILAR PHASE HEY WE CAN JUST BUY MONEY BUT YOU EVENTUALLY CLIMB THAT HILL AND THE GAMEPLAY SHINES ONCE YOU GET GOOD AT IT SO MY ROOMMATE AND I GRINDED THROUGH ABOUT MORE 2 PLAYER GAMES WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TRYING TO BEAT THE VERY SIMPLE PLAY ARGAGARG ONLY BUY BASIC ATTACKS STRATEGY BUT NO THERE'S JUST NOTHING THERE SO FINALLY I CHECKED THE INTERNET TO SEE WHAT'S THE DEAL ARE WE STRATEGICALLY INEPT OR IS THE GAME THIS UNBALANCED

AND THE ANSWER IS YEAH THE GAME IS JUST THAT UNBALANCED YOU CAN'T BEAT BASIC ATTACKS IN 1ST EDITION THEY RELEASED A 2ND AND 3RD EDITION WHICH FIXED THE GAME THE NEW EDITIONS MADE ALL OF THE ACTIONS IN THE GAME 2 CHEAPER THEY MADE BASIC ATTACKS DRAIN YOUR MONEY THEY MADE ARGAGARG MUCH WORSE PRETTY MUCH FIXED EVERYTHING BUT MAN WHAT DO I DO WITH MY BROKEN GAME I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE BUT I'M CERTAINLY NEVER GOING TO PLAY IT AGAIN
BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL

AFTER TEN GAMES YOU'VE SEEN ALL OF THE CARDS

AFTER TWENTY GAMES YOU'VE SEEN MOST OF THE HAUNTS AND PROBABLY A HANDFUL MORE THAN ONCE

AFTER THIRTY I NEVER WANT TO OPEN THE BOX AGAIN I DON'T THINK THE EXPANSION IS GOING TO FIX THAT FOR ME
MAGIC THE GATHERING
KINGSBURG AND ILLUMINATI
ARCTIC SCAVENGERS WHEN WE FIRST GOT IT IT WAS PRETTY AMAZING A DECKBUILDER WITH A BIT MORE THEMATIC PUNCH THAN DOMINION A WAY TO PUSH YOUR LUCK AND ACTUAL REAL BLUFFING AND INTERACTION BETWEEN PLAYERS BUT NOW A DOZEN GAMES AFTER ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES I ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT JUST SEEMS SO LIGHT ON SUBSTANCE AND STAYING POWER EVEN DOMINION HAS ALL THOSE EXPANSIONS SCAVENGERS JUST DOESN'T HAVE A SPARK TO DRAG ME AWAY FROM COSMIC ENCOUNTER AND ANIS ANYMORE
BANG THE DICE GAME IT CAN BE FUN WITH THE RIGHT CROWD BUT WITH OUR USUAL GROUP IT'S BECOMES A TEDIOUS PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE EXERCISE IN KINGMAKING EVERY GAME THE SAME FEW PEOPLE WILL BE TARGETED AND KILLED IMMEDIATELY REGARDLESS OF WHOSE SIDE THEY ARE ON AND IT'S JUST BORING EVEN THE NEW EXPANSION DIDN'T SAVE THIS ONE
THE RESISTANCE

GOOD GAME DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT HONESTLY IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WHO CAN YELL THE LOUDEST AND WHO IS LIKED THE MOST FOR NO APPARENT REASON EVERYTHING IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND WHILE IT CAN BE FUN IT CAN ALSO JUST BE A HEADACHE AND A HALF
CODE NAMES GREAT GAME FUN AND VERY WELL MADE BUT HOLY HELL I'VE PLAYED THIS MORE TIMES THAN I'LL EVER WANT TO THE THING IS THAT IT'S EASY TO GET INTO AND ROUNDS ARE SUPER SHORT SO WE USUALLY END UP PLAYING IT FOR LIKE STRAIGHT HOURS THAT'S FINE BUT THEN NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY ANYTHING ELSE I PREFER THE COMPLEX THEMATIC GAMES WHERE THE GROUP GETS LOST IN THE STORY OF THE PLAY SESSION CODE NAMES ISN'T ONE OF THOSE

SIMILARLY CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY HAS LOST ALL FLAVOR FOR ME I APPRECIATE THE DESIGNERS AND THE SILLINESS OF IT ALL BUT THE NOVELTY WEARS OFF ONCE THE COMBINATIONS BECOME JUST THAT GETTING THE RIGHT COMBO ONCE YOU KNOW SARAH LOVES DEAD BABY JOKES YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF LUCKY HAND YOU NEED TO GET WIN HER OVER THERE'S NO REAL SYSTEM OF CORRECT INCORRECT ANSWERS SO THE GAME BECOMES A BATTLE OF WHO IS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GIVE THE JUDGE A CARD THEY THINK MEANS THEY KNOW THEM BEST TO SOMEONE WHO GAMES FOR THE CHALLENGE AND THE CREATIVE ASPECTS THIS SYSTEM GOT STALE YEARS AGO
I THINK THAT CAVERN NEEDS AT LEAST A LONG REST BEFORE I WILL PLAY IT AGAIN I LOVE THE GAME BUT IT HAS GOTTEN DULL AND MY GIRLFRIEND ALWAYS BEATS ME IN GAMES

NOW SHE IS CONSISTENTLY BEATING ME IN A FEAST FOR ODIN
THE RESISTANCE I'VE TOLD THIS STORY BEFORE WHEN EVERYONE OPENED THEIR EYES DURING MY LAST GAME OF THIS ONE PLAYER ACCUSED TWO OTHERS RIGHT OFF THE BAT AND REFUSED TO CHANGE HIS MIND ABSOLUTELY REFUSED THERE WAS PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT THE TWO HE WAS ACCUSING WERE INNOCENT AND THAT TWO OTHER PLAYERS WERE THE GUILTY ONES BUT HE JUST WOULD NOT CHANGE HIS MIND HE WAS SO STUBBORN NOTHING WOULD CHANGE HIS MIND HE JUST SAT THERE SAYING IT'S A B HE WOULDN'T APPROVE TEAMS CONTAINING EITHER PEOPLE NEEDLESS TO SAY WE LOST THE GAME AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE OR WILLING TO PLAY IT SINCE
DOMINION FOR SURE WE WENT THROUGH A PHASE OF PLAYING IT ONLINE AND MAYBE I'D PLAY IT AGAIN THAT WAY BUT PLAYING IT IN THE FLESH NO WAY
RISK IT WAS THE FIRST REAL GAME I EVER PLAYED AND MY GROUP OF GUYS WAS REALLY INTO IT WE PLAYED TWICE A WEEKEND FOR ALMOST A YEAR WE EVEN MADE A TERRIBLE SHORT FILM ABOUT IT GOD IT WAS SO BAD
MONOPOLY IS THE OBVIOUS ANSWER FOR ME I CAN PLAY PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER GAME AS LONG AS THE DOWNTIME ISN'T TOO LONG
DOMINION MY FRIENDS AND I WENT ON THIS WHOLE DOMINION THING FOR A GOOD BIT OF MY FIRST SEMESTER AT UNIVERSITY WE LITERALLY HAVE PLAYED ALL THE EXPANSIONS AND I USED TO BE UP UNTIL PLAYING ONLINE WITH THEM DO I REGRET IT NUMBER BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE IT IN ME TO PLAY IT AGAIN
PROBABLY COSMIC ENCOUNTER IT'S A GREAT GAME BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT CRITICALLY IT'S STILL VERY RANDOMIZED AND LESS SKILL BASED NOT MY KIND OF GAME
ASCENSION IT WAS ONE OF OUR FIRST MODERN BOARD GAMES SO WE PLAYED IT ALL THE DAMN TIME I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH IT AND AM GRATEFUL FOR IT GIVING ME AN NICE INTRO INTO THE HOBBY BUT I'VE SINCE FOUND MORE INTERESTING DECKBUILDERS THAT FIT MY LIKES INTERESTS BETTER MARVEL LEGENDARY IS MY GO TO BUY FROM A CONSTANTLY CHANGING ROW GAME AND TRAINS PLUS THE RISING SUN EXPANSION IS MY FAVORITE MARKETPLACE GAME THE ADDED BOARD AREA CONTROL ELEMENT IS A GREAT TOUCH AS WELL
THERE'S NEVER A GAME I'VE GOT TO PLAYS WITH THAT I WON'T PLAY AGAIN

THERE ARE GAMES I WON'T PLAY WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE AGAIN

MUNCHKIN AND CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY WILL NEVER AGAIN SEE PLAY IN MY GAMING GROUP WE KNOW ALL THE CARDS HOW IT PLAYS AND THEY'VE LOST IMPACT

BUT FINDING A NEW GAMER AND USING THOSE TO INTRODUCE THEM INTO THE HOBBY AS I DID YEP I FIND A WHOLE NEW SET OF FUN IN HELPING OTHERS BEGIN THAT JOURNEY AND FROM A SELFISH POINT OF VIEW IF I GET MUNCHKIN AND CH OUT OF THEIR SYSTEM EARLY WE CAN MOVE ON TO SOMETHING REALLY SATISFYING
FOR ME IT'S DEAD OF WINTER THERES ONE GUY IN OUR GROUP WHO KNOWS EVERY SINGLE CARD FROM THE SECRET OBJECTIVES TO THE CROSSROADS DECK HE'LL ALWAYS FIGURE OUT OR SAYS HE'S FIGURED OUT EVERYONE OBJECTIVE HE'LL KNOW THE OUTCOMES OF EACH OF THE CROSSROADS AND BASICALLY TELL US WHAT WE HAVE TO DO HE'S KINDA RUINED THE GAME FOR ME
PICKUP
STAR REALMS FOR ME FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS THE PHONE APP WAS THE GREATEST THING EVER I CAN'T ANYMORE IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH GAME FOR THAT MANY PLAYS
BALDUR GATE 2

COOPS WRONG SUB

AND WRONG THREAD

I REGRET MY ACTIONS
CHINA TOWN AND THE ORIGINAL TICKET TO RIDE THOUGH MORE OF I WANT A BREAK SINCE MY WIFE AND SISTER IN LAW REALLY ONLY LIKE PLAYING THOSE TWO GAMES
I THINK CYCLADES WOULD BE IT FOR ME I DON'T HAVE ACTUAL COUNTS ON HAVE MANY PLAYS OF IT I HAVE IT MIGHT JUST BE IN THE OR SO STILL CLOSE ENOUGH

ANYWAY FRIEND OF MINE GOT IT YEARS AGO SHORTLY AFTERWARDS WE AND OUR BOARDGAMING GROUP WENT TO A SUMMER HOUSE FOR A FEW DAYS HOLIDAY OVER THE SUMMER BREAK FROM UNI DURING THOSE FEW DAYS WE PLAYED IT A TON AND REALLY DUG INTO THE GAME AND LOVED IT TO BITS WE ALSO PLAYED IT QUITE A LOT AFTERWARDS FOR SOME TIME ALSO REALLY ENJOYING IT AT SOME POINT MY FRIEND GOT THE HADES EXPANSION WHICH SADLY FELL A BIT FLAT IT DOESN'T INTEGRATE SMOOTHLY WITH THE BASE GAME AND INTEREST DIMINISHED AT SOME POINT

THOUGH NOW I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD MY FILL OF IT AND I'M NOT TOO KEEN ON PLAYING IT AGAIN WHILE WE HAVEN'T SOLVED THE GAME IN THE USUAL SENSE I JUST FEEL LIKE I'VE EXPLORED THE GAME TO ITS FULLEST PLUS THERE ARE SOME MINOR ANNOYANCES WITH IT FOR INSTANCE GAME ENDS DUE TO A ZEUS SHUFFLE FOR A PEGASUS OR SIMILAR I KNOW THE HADES EXPANSION REMOVES THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM BUT IT JUST FEELS LIKE A BIT OF A BLOATED EXPANSION THAT'S BOLTED ONTO AN OTHERWISE BEAUTIFULLY STREAMLINED GAME I THINK IT'D REQUIRE THE TITAN EXPANSION FOR ME TO MAYBE REKINDLE MY INTEREST IN THE GAME
I THINK I'VE MANAGED TO AVOID PLAYING CATAN TIMES BUT IF I HAVE PLAYED IT TIMES IT'S AT THE TOP OF THIS LIST

ALSO DOMINION PLAYS AND COMPLETELY BURNED OUT ON IT TICKET TO RIDE


JUST SO YOU DON'T THINK I'M BIASED AGAINST GATEWAY GAMES I STILL LIKE CARCASSONNE AND LOVE BONANZA
I'M SO SICK OF RISK LEGACY IT WAS INTERESTING THE FIRST FEW TIMES WE PLAYED BUT NOW THAT WE'VE UNLOCKED ALL THE EXPANSIONS THERE'S NOTHING THAT REALLY EXCITES ME ABOUT IT ANYMORE UNFORTUNATELY THE GUY WHO OWNS IT REALLY WANTS TO COMPLETE THE BOARD WHICH I DO UNDERSTAND HE'S REALLY INTO IT WE HAVE A WEEKLY GAME NIGHT BUT ALL WE HAD BEEN PLAYING FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS WAS RISK LEGACY UNTIL I SUGGESTED WE DID A BRIEF DUNGEON CRAWL IN PATHFINDER WE PROBABLY HAVE ONLY ONE MORE SESSION OF THAT THOUGH BEFORE IT'S BACK TO FREAKING RISK

EDIT I GUESS WE PROBABLY HAVEN'T QUITE DONE PLAYS OF IT BUT IT HAS BEEN ENOUGH
SETTLERS OF CATAN IT'S NOT A BAD GAME THOUGH IT DOES HAVE SOME FLAWS BUT I PLAYED IT SO MUCH FOR SO LONG THAT I NEVER WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN
THAT BEING SAID I STILL HAVE MY COPY BECAUSE I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE FACT THAT SETTLERS GOT ME STARTED IN THIS HOBBY AROUND YEARS AGO I KEEP IT OUT OF NOSTALGIA
CATAN TICKET TO RIDE BASE GAME CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY
BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL IT'S THE ONLY GAME MY GROUP OF FRIENDS EVER WANT TO PLAY
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY LOSES ITS CHARM PRETTY QUICK UNFORTUNATELY I HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT IN ALMOST TWO YEARS IT USED TO BE THE GO TO FOR BIG GROUPS BUT IT'S JUST NOT FUN ONCE YOU KNOW ASK THE CARDS
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY
STAR REALMS

GOT THE GAME PLAYED A LOT WITH A FEW PEOPLE NOTICED HOW UTTERLY LUCK DRIVEN AND LOW ON DECISIONS THAT GAME REALLY IS NOW I WILL NOT PLAY THAT GAME EVER AGAIN I ACTUALLY EVEN DESPISE IT IT'S A NON GAME DISGUISED TO BE A GAME AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S WAY TOO HIGH ON ANY LISTS
THE RESISTANCE WAS ONE WE USED TO PLAY ALL THE TIME AND I'M BURNT OUT BY SECRET ROLE PARTY GAMES NOW
PUERTO RICO AND CAELUS

AFTER A LARGE NUMBER OF PLAYS THE SMALL FLAWS AND ALWAYS OPTIMAL STRATEGIES STARTED TAKING OVER AT THIS POINT I WILL LIKELY NEVER PLAY THEM AGAIN
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY AND THE RESISTANCE

ALSO SETTLERS OF CATAN I AND MY GROUP PLAYED IT NO LESS THAN A HUNDRED TIMES MAYBE MORE WE HAVE A BUNCH OF EXPANSIONS BUT WE USUALLY STUCK WITH CITIES AND KNIGHTS AND SEAFARERS WE'D PLAY ANYTHING FROM PERSON GAMES TO PERSON GAMES BIG AND SMALL MAPS GAME RULES AND HOUSE RULES WE'VE SEEN LITERALLY EVERYTHING THE GAME HAS TO OFFER AND MOST OF US HAVE WON DOZENS OF TIMES EACH WE'RE DONE WITH IT IT HAS NOTHING LEFT TO OFFER US
MONOPOLY
VANILLA TICKET TO RIDE AS IN JUST THE USA MAP I CAN'T EVEN COUNT HOW MANY TIMES I'VE PLAYED IT BECAUSE I HAVE A COUSIN WHO LOVES IT SO MUCH LUCKILY I PURCHASED TICKET TO RIDE RAILS AND SALES AND HE LOVED THAT EVEN MORE SO I'M SURE I'LL GET SICK OF THAT SOON
I'M STILL IN RECOVERY ON WONDERS EXCELLENT GAME BUT MY BOARD GAME GROUP LEANED TOO HEAVILY ON IT FOR A WHILE SINCE IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW GAMES THAT WE COULD AGREE ACCOMMODATE THE SIZE OF OUR GROUP ADDING THE LEADERS EXPANSION HELPED A LOT BUT MORE THAN A FEW PEOPLE IN THE GROUP REFUSE TO USE BABEL EVEN THOUGH IT'S AN INTERESTING MECHANISM TO ME
MUNCHKIN NEVER AGAIN
CH PANDEMIC BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL ANY MTG FORMAT THAT ISN'T LEGACY VINTAGE OR CUBE
CHESS I'M JUST BAD AT IT
MONOPOLY
CATAN
MAGE KNIGHT I'LL STILL BE IN MY FULL GAME THE DAY I DIE FROM OLD AGE THOUGH NO SERIOUSLY THIS GAME IS JUST TO MUCH RULES AND SAUF TEACHING IT TO NEW PLAYERS EVERY OTHER TIME WISH IT WAS MORE STREAMLINED
RESISTANCE

IT LITERALLY IS THE GAME THAT RUINS FRIENDSHIPS AND I AM ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE IN MY FRIEND GROUP THAT DOESN'T CARE FOR IT ANYMORE IT'S NOT FUN AND IT ONLY SPARKS ARGUMENTS
DOMINION SETTLERS OF CATAN ARE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY

I STILL LIKE DOMINION BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS MUCH AS I USED TO AND THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING I'D RATHER PLAY
AFTER READING SOME RESPONSE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY I'M SURPRISED THAT IT HAPPENED BUT I GOT TIRED OF DICK JOKES AT LEAST IN THE CH SENSE
MONOPOLY
LAST NIGHT ON EARTH I'LL ALWAYS BUST IT OUT FOR LESS FAMILIAR FRIENDS BUT FOR ME THE ZOMBIES JUST DO NOTHING IN THE GAME IT'S SO BORING AND BASED ON YOUR DRAW ALSO THE ZOMBIES JUST REALLY SEEM WEAK EITHER YOU GET THE WIN EARLY DISAPPOINTING ALL HUMAN PLAYERS OR YOU JUST DAWDLE AROUND WHILE THE HUMANS GO ABOUT TRYING TO BEAT THE SCENARIO

IT'S MORE OR LESS A AVE GAME PACKAGED AS A PVP IN FACT WE'VE PLAYED A FEW TIMES AS AVE IT'S OK IN THAT REGARD BUT EVEN THEN I THINK ZOMBIES HAVE WON LESS THAN GAMES OUT OF MAYBE TIMES PLAYED AND EVERY TIME THEY WON IT WAS REMARKABLY UNSATISFYING
IT WAS PANDEMIC HENCE I WASN'T INTERESTED IN THE LEGACY VERSION AT ALL GLAD I BELIEVED IN THE HYPE THOUGH AS NOW I'M A PANDEMIC LEGACY FAN BOY

STILL NO REAL DESIRE TO PLAY VANILLA PANDEMIC AGAIN
COUP

SO TIRED OF THIS GAME AND GAMES LIKE IT

THAT SAID THIS GAME IS A GREAT WAY TO GET CASUAL NEW GAMERS INTO MORE INTERESTING GAMES I'VE SUCCESSFULLY TAKEN ONE FRIEND WHO'S MOST COMPLEX GAMING EXPERIENCE WAS RISK CONVINCED HIM TO PLAY COUP THEN MOVED STRAIGHT ON TO LORDS OF WATERDEEP
MTG SETTLERS DOMINION CH RISK AXIS AND ALLIES SMALL WORLD ANYTHING WITH RAILS OR TRAIN OR TICKET IN THE TITLE SMASH UP ILLUMINATI

I'D ACTUALLY PLAY ANY OF THEM IF THE OTHER PERSON WANTS TO PLAY PAYS ATTENTION TAKES MINUTES OR LESS PER TURN AND DOESN'T WHINE WHEN LOSING OR WANT TO LOOK AT RULES EVERY MINUTES EXCEPT MTG NEVER AGAIN
RISK I HATE ROLLING DICE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S THE VERY LAST BATTLE AND YOU HAVE VS ARMIES
I THINK THE ONLY GAME I'VE PLAYED THAT MANY TIMES AND DON'T WISH TO PLAY AGAIN IS MAGIC THE GATHERING IT'S BEEN PROBABLY YEARS SINCE LAST PLAYED ANYWAY I WOULD MUCH RATHER PLAY NETRUNNER
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I'VE REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE NEW ERA BUT I BET I HAVEN'T
WEREWOLF EVERY PARTY GET TOGETHER BIRTHDAY UGH I'VE NEVER LIKED THE GAME AND I ESPECIALLY HATE IT NOW
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY AND MONOPOLY
RISK I HATE THAT GAME MY HATRED OF IT GREW EXPONENTIALLY AFTER I FOUND AXIS AND ALLIES IT'S BASICALLY RISK THAT DOESN'T SUCK
SPLENDOR I PLAYED IT I ENJOYED IT BUT NOW I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO EXPERIENCE WITH THAT GAME VARIABILITY THROUGH CARD DECKS ONLY GOES SO FAR

I ALSO SECOND NODS TO APPLES TO APPLES AND ITS OFFSHOOTS
BANG I'VE PLAYED THIS CARD GAME SO MANY TIMES WITH MY FRIENDS WE ALL STARTED TO HATE IT
I AM GRATEFUL TO PUERTO RICO FOR BEING MY GATEWAY INTO THE CULTURE OF BOARD GAMES BUT IT'S SERVED IT'S PURPOSE AND CAN GO AWAY NOW
I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A FUN GAME BUT EMPIRE I WOULD ABSOLUTELY KILL TO HAVE MORE BOARDS BUT I DOUBT THAT'S EVER GOING TO HAPPEN IT MIGHT BE WORTH INVESTING IN THE NEWER VERSION BUT IT LOOKS LIKE AN ALMOST ENTIRELY DIFFERENT GAME
MENS BERGER JE DIET NEVER AGAIN

WIKIPEDIA COMMONS

IMBASE IMAGEBASE EXTRA-LARGE FC
RISK IS WITH A BULLET ALSO SMALL WORLD I USED TO AT LEAST ENJOY IT ON IPAD BUT I'M COMPLETELY SICK OF IT IN THAT FORM TOO NEVER AGAIN
BASICALLY I GET TIRED OF GAMES WHEN I REPLAY THEM TOO MUCH SO NAMELY

SETTLERS OF CATAN IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I'VE WON TOO MUCH AND I CAN NEVER WIN AGAIN BECAUSE EVERYONE JUST GANGS UP ON ME

CODENAMES I LOVE THE IDEA BUT AFTER SO MANY GAMES IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH VARIETY TO KEEP IT EXCITING

MUNCHKIN I'M TIRED OF TRYING TO BE THE LAST ONE TO ALTERNATIVELY SPENDING THE ENTIRE GAME AS A CLERIC HOPING
FOR DIVINE INTERVENTION

KING OF TOKYO I FOUND THIS GAME TO BE TOO MUCH LUCK FOR ME
BANG
MONOPOLY
STAR REALMS

THE RESISTANCE
I'M BURNED OUT ON THE GAME OF THRONES BOARD GAME THE PROBLEM IS THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN PLAYING WITH ESSENTIALLY THE SAME GROUP THE GAME IS TOO PREDICTABLE THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF VIABLE STRATEGIES FOR ANY GIVEN HOUSE AND AT THIS POINT THE CORE MEMBERS OF OUR GROUP KNOW THEM PRETTY WELL EVEN WITH TIDE OF BATTLE CARDS AND WILDING CARDS THERES NOT MUCH VARIETY BETWEEN EACH HOUR GAME

IT DOESN'T HELP THAT PEOPLE TEND TO PLAY THE SAME HOUSES CONSISTENTLY MOSTLY DUE TO INVESTMENT IN THE SHOW
PANDEMIC LEGACY ANYONE
THAT GAME JUST DIDNT CLICK WITH ME AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT MANY TIMES TO FINISH DIDN'T HELP
ONE OF OUR PLAYER AS WELL SUFFERS FROM THE PANDEMIC SYNDROME PLAYING OTHERS TURNS AND TAKING TWENTY MINUTES HIMSELF FOR HIS OWN TURN REFUSING OUR SUGGESTIONS
THE GAME IS DEFINITELY INTERESTING AND I UNDERSTAND WHY PPL LOVE IT AT LEAST I GET TO TEAR UP CARD OR TWO
AXIS AND ALLIES

PLAYED ABOUT GAMES OVER AN YEAR PERIOD GROWING UP OFTEN A WEEKEND BETWEEN AND YEARS OLD WENT THROUGH ABOUT FOUR COPIES HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN EVER PLAYING AGAIN
DOMINION
WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT IT WAS REVOLUTIONARY AND FANTASTIC IF HORRIBLY UNBALANCED BUT AS YOU GET BETTER AND PLAY WITH BETTER AND BETTER PEOPLE IT JUST DEVOLVES INTO A SORT OF MATH PROBLEM INSTEAD OF AN ACTUAL GAME
WITH DOMINION YOU LOOK AT THE INITIAL BOARD FIGURE OUT YOUR STRATEGY AND PLAY IT THROUGH THERE'S VERY LITTLE THINKING ON YOUR FEET COMPARED TO ANY OTHER DECKBUILDER I'VE PLAYED

AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF MENTIONS OF MONOPOLY IN THE THREAD WHICH IS SORT OF THE MEME HATED BOARDGAME HONESTLY I'D RATHER PLAY THROUGH A GAME OF MONOPOLY RIGHT NOW THAN ANY MORE DOMINION
WEREWOLF CONSTANTLY PLAYED IT WHEN IT DIDN'T APPEAL TO ME TO KEEP MY FRIENDS HAPPY PRETTY MUCH RUINED ALL HIDDEN ROLE GAMES FOR ME
FIVE TRIBES MY FRIENDS LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT'S GROWN A BIT OLD AFTER THE 8TH OR 9TH PLAY IMHO THE GAME LENDS ITSELF TO ACTION PARALYSIS SINCE ALL THE INFORMATION IS ON THE TABLE AND PLAYERS CAN MATH OUT THEIR OPPONENTS MOVES BEFORE ACTING ALSO THE BIDDING SYSTEM IN RELATION TO THE GAMEPLAY IS A BIT OFF A FEW TIMES OUR GROUP HAS FOUND THAT THE ONLY PROFITABLE BID BASED ON HOW THE MEEDLESS ARE ARRANGED AT THAT POINT IN TIME IS THE MAX SINCE ANY LOWER BID CAN BE OUTBID TAKING AWAY THE PLAY THAT YOU ARE BIDDING FOR
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY AND I'M GETTING THERE WITH SMASH UP I HAVE A PLAYER WHO WANTS TO PLAY THIS AND NOTHING BUT THIS AND IT'S WEARING THIN
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY OBVIOUS REASONS BECAUSE I PLAY WITH LOTS OF GAMERS USUALLY AND THEY ALWAYS WANT TO PLAY IT

COUP BECAUSE IT WAS MY FIRST GAME WITH A GROUP OF BUDDIES AND NOBODY ELSE WANTED TO BUY ANYMORE GAMES AND STUCK TO THIS FOR A FEW MONTHS WE STARTED UNDERSTANDING HOW WE EACH PLAYED AND IT GOT BORING THANK THE LORD I STARTED DONATING PLASMA AND WORKING SO I COULD FEED MY HUNGER FOR DIFFERENT GAMES
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY ALTHOUGH ANYONE HERE PROBABLY SEEN THAT COMING
COSMIC ENCOUNTER
DIPLOMACY
ROBO RALLY
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY
FURY OF DRACULA
CODENAMES
COUP
WEREWOLF

ANYTHING DRIVEN BY LYING GUESSING AND NEGOTIATION IS NOT FOR ME PERSONALLY I'M ALSO NOT FOND OF CHAOTIC OUTCOMES AND WOULD RATHER PLAY A GAME THAT IS CLEAR AND DECISION DRIVEN AT ALL STAGES
BOSS MONSTER MY SIBLINGS ADORE IT BUT I CAN'T GET PAST HOW LUCK BASED IT IS IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I SIT DOWN WITH OTHER GREAT GAMES AND HUM SO WHAT SHALL WE PLAY ONLY TO FEEL MY FEET BE PULLED OUT FROM BENEATH ME AS LONG SHADOWS AND MENACING LITTLE SMILES FILL THEIR POINTY TEETHED FACES TRAPPED CHERUBS
COSMIC ENCOUNTER A SIMPLE POKER GAME WHERE ALIEN POWERS TURN THE BASIC RULES INTO DELICIOUS AND HILARIOUS CHAOS

SMASH UP IT WAS THE FIRST BOARD GAME I BOUGHT KINDA WORE IT OUT
BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL I'VE GOT A GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT LOVES THIS GAME EVERY TIME WE GET TOGETHER IT'S THE FIRST GAME THEY WANT TO PLAY AND THEN THEY USUALLY WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN IT WAS INTERESTING THE FIRST FEW TIMES BUT AFTER YEARS I'M THOROUGHLY SICK OF THE GAME
EVERYTIME SOMEONE MENTIONS CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY I CRINGE A LITTLE I HAVE THE CARDS MEMORIZED IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY
A LOT OF WELL KNOWN GAMES THAT ARE WELL LOVED BY PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY PLAY THOSE AND NO OTHERS EXAMPLES CARCASSONNE SETTLERS IF CATAN MUNCHKIN TICKET TO RIDE INGENIOUS THAT'S MOSTLY ENOUGH FOR ONE LIFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D RATHER PLAY SOMETHING MORE FUN NOWADAYS
NETRUNNER
THESE GAMES ARE FOR CANADIANS GET OUT OF HERE WITH YOUR OP USD
EVERYTHING IS ON SALE THERE I JUST DROPPED FAT ONES ON RANDOM GAMES
WOW ORDERED THANK YOU OP I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK I WAS EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THIS GAME BUT AT THAT PRICE IT'S MINE IS THIS REALLY THE LAST PRINT RUN FOR A WHILE THAT MAKES THIS EVEN MORE FORTUITOUS
I GOT AWAY EASY ONLY GIVING THIS WEEKEND
FOR ALL YOU AMERICANS CARDANUS ALSO HAS OFF EVERYTHING FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE IS CHEAPER THERE AS WELL
PRETTY CHEAP IF YOU PRE ORDER IT DIRECTLY FROM PLOTTER LIKE EUROS
AWESOME I JUST BOUGHT IT IT WAS CHEAPER FROM THAT SITE COMPARED TO MY FAGS HUGE THANKS FOR THIS POST I WAS WORRIED I WOULD NEVER GET THIS GAME TOO
THIS BLOG DOESN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT NEGOTIATION IN BOARD GAMES IT JUST TALKS ABOUT BOARD GAMES THAT HAVE NEGOTIATION IN THEM WHAT IS NEGOTIATION WHAT ARE ITS CONSEQUENCES ON GAMEPLAY IS IT BECOMING MORE OR LESS COMMON IN GAMES WHAT ARE SOME STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS THAT GO ALONG WITH NEGOTIATION ARE THERE ANY WAYS TO THINK ABOUT NEGOTIATION IN GENERAL
I MOSTLY DESPISE NEGOTIATION GAMES WITH A FIERY PASSION BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE VERY ANTAGONISTIC 2 GO ON FOREVER AND HAVE ARBITRARY OUTCOMES

IT'S INTERESTING THAT TASSIE MENTIONS ONE OF MY FEW EXCEPTIONS PIT WHICH IS A SHORT GAME THAT'S TOO RIDICULOUS TO GET PEOPLE ANGRY
I GENERALLY AVOID GAMES THAT ALLOW NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE DON'T MAKE DECISIONS SOLELY BASED ON INFO
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ABOUT NEGOTIATION IN BOARD GAMES ON THE ONE HAND IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR PLAYERS WHO ARE BEHIND TO MAKE A TRADE AND GIVE EACH OTHER AN ADVANTAGE TO HELP CATCH UP ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN NEVER GET OVER THE UNEASY FEELING THAT NO PLAYER WOULD OFFER A TRADE IF THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE GETTING THE BETTER END OF THE DEAL SOMEHOW A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF IMPERFECT INFORMATION IS NECESSARY TO MAKE TRADING INTERESTING

I MADE A STRANGE DISCOVERY IN MONOPOLY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I STARTED HIDING ONE OF MY INITIAL BILLS UNDERNEATH MY PROPERTY AT ONE POINT AND FOUND THAT MY FAMILY WAS MORE WILLING TO TRADE WITH ME UNDER THE BELIEF THAT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BUY HOUSES OR HOTELS ON A FOLLOW-UP TURN MESSY
I LIKE GAMES WITH A LOT OF PLAYER INTERACTION SO I AM A FAN OF NEGOTIATION IN GAMES EVEN THOUGH I LIKE MANY OTHERS IN THIS THREAD AM KNOWN AS THE HARDCORE GAMER AND THUS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH SUSPICION OR COLLUDED AGAINST FROM TURN ONE

BUT NEGOTIATION IS VERY VERY HARD TO GET RIGHT

NEGOTIATION LEAD TO TRADES BETWEEN PLAYERS THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF TRADES IN BOARDGAMES UNFORCED BUT ALLOWED TRADES FORCED TRADES BUT WITH CHOICE AND FORCED TRADES WITHOUT CHOICE NEGOTIATION IS A VITAL COMPONENT OF ANY TRADE WITH CHOICE

WHY TRADE FOR UNFORCED TRADES THE PARTIES INVOLVED ALWAYS TRADE FOR SOME PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR SITUATION THERE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT FLAVORS OF IMPROVEMENT OF A SITUATION THOUGH PLAYERS COULD TRADE FOR RAW GAIN IN THEIR POSITION OR THEY COULD TRADE TO REDUCE A LOSS THESE TWO FLAVORS LEAD TO VERY DIFFERENT DYNAMICS IF TWO PLAYERS ARE TRADING AND BOTH EXPECT TO COME OUT BETTER AT THE END IT IS FRIENDLY AND IT BECOMES A QUESTION OF WHO GETS THE GREATER ADVANTAGE IF TWO PLAYERS ARE TRADING BOTH TO REDUCE LOSSES THERE IS A SIMILAR CAMARADERIE WITH A BIT OF DESPERATION THROWN IN HOWEVER IF ONE IS NEGOTIATING FOR A GAIN AND THE OTHER TO REDUCE A LOSS AND THEY BOTH KNOW IT THERE CAN BE A REAL MEAN ELEMENT TO THE WHOLE TRANSACTION

THEN THERE IS THE EFFECT AND THE REACTION OF THE THIRD PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION EVERYONE ELSE AT THE TABLE

ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION OR OTHER INFORMATION LIMITING SCHEMES CAN BLUNT SOME OF THE SHARPER ASPECTS BUT THAT COMES WITH ITS OWN GAMEPLAY COMPLICATIONS

I PERSONALLY THINK NEGOTIATION IS AN UNDERUTILIZED MECHANIC BUT I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO GET RIGHT

I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO NEW ANGELES BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS A LOT OF NEGOTIATION I AM EAGER TO SEE HOW WELL THEY PULL IT OFFICIAL


CHINATOWN STILL THE BEST TRADING GAME PURE TRADING WITH PURE NEGOTIATION
I CONSISTENTLY HAVE A PROBLEM PLAYING GAMES WITH PLAYERS WHO EITHER AREN'T GREAT AT NEGOTIATING OR DISLIKE THAT ASPECT OR WHATEVER AND IT CAN REALLY BE THE BIGGEST FLAW OF THE NEGOTIATION MECHANIC AND IN A MUCH DIFFERENT WAY THAN BEING BAD AT OTHER GAMES

BEST EXAMPLE IS A RECENT GAME OF GAME OF THRONES WHERE A PLAYER WHO WAS GEOGRAPHICALLY RIGHT NEXT TO ME DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WAS INTERPRETING MY NEGOTIATIONS AS A RUSE WHEN IN FACT HE WAS ABOUT TO BE STEAMROLLER BY ANOTHER PLAYER AS SUCH I WAS DISADVANTAGED AND HE WAS QUICKLY ELIMINATED MAKING THE THIRD PLAYER THAT MUCH STRONGER FOR HAVING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAKEST PLAYER NOT MANY OTHER MECHANICS ALLOW YOU TO EXPLOIT BEING BAD OR UNFAMILIAR IN THE SAME WAY THAT NEGOTIATION CAN

THIS HAS ALSO BEEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS TURNED PEOPLE OFF FROM DIPLOMACY IN MY EXPERIENCE THEY EXPECT IT TO BE A STRAIGHT WAR GAME AND ARE CONFUSED AND IRRIGATED WHEN THEIR PLANS SEEM UNATTAINABLE WITHOUT TALKING TO THE OTHER PLAYERS YOU BASICALLY HAVE NO STRATEGY

THAT SAID IT IS ONE OF MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MECHANICS WHEN ALL PLAYERS ARE INTO IT ON THE SAME LEVEL
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR MY GROUP TO PLAY ANY NEGOTIATING GAMES NO ONE EVER TRADES ANYTHING
ONE OF THE KEY REASONS I STOPPED PLAYING MUNCHKIN WAS I GREW TIRED OF FRIENDLY NEGOTIATIONS TO AID IN COMBAT SOMEONE WOULD OFFER TO HELP FOR THE LEAST POSSIBLE REWARD MEANING UP UNTIL LEVEL NOBODY LOST A FIGHT AT ALL IF PEOPLE START BEING NICE TO THEIR FRIENDS ALL THE TIME HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY FUN
A LOT OF THE COMPLAINS ABOUT NEGOTIATION SEEM TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT KNOWING HOW PEOPLE WILL ACT HELPS YOU MAKE BETTER DECISIONS AND WIN I'M KNOWN AS ONE OF THE BEST GAMERS IN MY GROUP AND SO PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T WANT TO TRADE WITH ME SO I EMBRACE THAT AND PLAY AROUND IT BY EMPHASIZING WHEN I'M LOSING AND EMPHASIZING WHEN OTHERS ARE WINNING I ALSO KNOW WHO MAKES DECISIONS BASED ON FEELINGS AND OTHER INFO AND ABUSE THAT BY SAYING THINGS WHEN THEY ARE TAKING THEIR TURNS OR CONSIDERING TRADES WITH OTHER PEOPLE I LOVE WINNING IN THESE SITUATIONS BECAUSE PEOPLE TRY TO GANG UP BUT CAN'T FULLY BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THEY WILL DO AND TRY TO COUNTER ACT IT BOARD GAMES WHERE THERE IS ONLY OPTIMAL MOVE AND YOU CAN ALWAYS DO IT WITH NO INTERFERENCE AREN'T AS FUN SOCIALLY UNLESS YOUR WHOLE GROUP IS REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT GAMES
THE MAIN PROBLEM I HAVE WITH NEGOTIATION GAMES IS THAT A SIMPLE MISTAKE BY ONE PLAYER CAN EASILY DECIDE THE GAME IN FAVOR OF ANOTHER PLAYER SO LOTS OF CAREFUL STRATEGIC WORK CAN BE DONE AWAY WITH IN SECONDS

I FIND THESE GAMES TO BE MUCH MORE SWINGY THAN EVEN CARD OR DICE GAMES
I MAY HAVE POSTED SOMETHING OVER ON BG ALONG THE LINES OF DIPLOMACY AND NEGOTIATION AS A MECHANIC THE DISCUSSION DREW OUT THE DIPLOMACY THE GAME PLAYERS BECAUSE I DIDN'T RATE IT AS AN EXAMPLE AND IN THERE OPINION IT IS THE ONE AND ONLY BUT THERE WERE LOTS OF GOOD SUGGESTIONS FOR NEGOTIATION GAMES HOW IT'S A META MECHANIC AND WHAT FUTURE GAME DEVELOPERS COULD DO TO INCORPORATE IT INTO THEIR PROJECTS HERE'S A LINK GIVE IT A READ IF CURIOUS I DO LOVE DIPLOMACY IN GAMES

THREAD

EDIT CORRECT LINK AND GRAMMAR


NO ONE CARES WHO STEVE TASSIE IS HE IS A NOBODY
MAKING AGREEMENTS NOT TO ATTACK EACH OTHER IN EXCHANGE FOR SOMETHING IS CHEATING FULL STOP


A FEW GUESSES AS TO WHAT MIGHT HAVE GONE WRONG

THE MARKET IS DIVIDED IN TWO IN STEPS AND 2 THE CURRENT MARKET AND THE FUTURE MARKET THE MARKET ALWAYS REARRANGES SO THE FOUR CHEAPER PLANTS ARE IN THE CURRENT MARKET SO YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE REALLY GREAT POWER PLANTS UNTIL LATE IN THE GAME ALSO THE MARKET AT THE START OF THE GAME IS FILLED WITH THE WORST POWER PLANTS SO IT TAKES TIME TO REFILL WITH GOOD STUFF

2 EACH PLAYER IS ALLOWED ONLY THREE POWER PLANTS

AT THE END OF EACH ROUND IN STEPS AND 2 THE MOST EXPENSIVE POWER PLANT IS PUT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DECK THIS MEANS THE BEST PLANTS ARE USUALLY AVAILABLE ONCE STEP ARRIVES AND YOU USUALLY NEED THE BEST PLANTS TO POWER THE MOST CITIES IN STEP

THE GAME IS A DELICATE BALANCE OF EXPANDING YOUR CITY NETWORK AND EXPANDING YOUR POWERING CAPABILITIES TURN ORDER IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THE DESIGNER HAS SAID SOMEWHERE THAT THE KEY STRATEGY IS NOT ACQUIRING MORE POWER PLANTS UNTIL YOU NEED THEM TO COVER THE CITIES YOU HAVE WILL BE GETTING IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD A LOT OF EXCESS POWER WHICH CAN UPSET THE TEMPO OF THE GAME SINCE YOU'RE ALL NEW PLAYERS IT'S NOT A HUGE DEAL BUT AN EXPERIENCED PLAYER MIGHT HAVE SHOWN YOU THE ERROR OF THIS WAY OF PLAYING
SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY FIGURED OUT WHERE YOU WENT WRONG TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW THE END GAME TENDS TO PLAY OUT THERE'S USUALLY A RACE BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

THOSE WHO WANT TO BUILD TO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND END THE GAME IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HOUSES OF POWER FUEL

2 THOSE WHO HAVE EXCESS CAPACITY WHO NEED AN EXTRA TURN TO SLINGSHOT PAST THOSE TRYING TO END THE GAME EARLY

FOR PLAYER TYPE USUALLY IT'S ABOUT HAVING THOSE EXTRA FEW DOLLARS TO BUILD THE HOUSE ONE TURN BEFORE TYPE 2 IS FULLY PREPARED TO POWER AND BUILD HOUSES AND POWER THEM A LOT OF THIS IS DETERMINED BY WHICH POWER PLANTS COME UP WHEN AND HOW AGGRESSIVE PEOPLE ARE ON THE BOARD THE MORE YOU GET A SENSE OF THE RHYTHM OF THE GAME THE MORE TIGHT AND TENSE THE LAST FEW TURNS WILL GET AS YOU HAVE TO START KEEPING TRACK OF MORE AND MORE VARIABLES
DID YOU ONLY BUY FROM THE TOP CARDS ACTIVE MARKET

DID YOU REORDER THE CARDS WHEN A NEW PLANT WAS ADDED TO THE ACTIVE FUTURES MARKET
ALSO ONE OF US WAS AHEAD BY A CITY AND THERE WASN'T A WAY FOR THE OTHER TWO TO GET AHEAD

THIS SOUNDS LIKE YOU MISSED THE BALANCING MECHANISM OF THE GAME
THE ONE WHO HAS THE MOST CITIES IS THE FIRST WHO HAS TO BID ON A POWERPLANTS DISADVANTAGEOUS AND THE LAST WHO GETS TO BUY RESOURCES DISADVANTAGEOUS BECAUSE MORE EXPENSIVE THAT WAY THE ONES WITH LESS CITIES HAVE A CHEAPER LIFE AND THUS AT SOME POINT SHOULD BE ABLE TO OVERTAKE
THERE WASN'T A REASON TO KEEP BUYING POWER PLANTS RESOURCES OR TO POWER ANY CITIES

EVEN IF YOU ONLY BUY ONE CITY CONNECTION PER TURN IT'S STRANGE THAT YOU FELT NO URGE TO NEITHER BUY RESOURCES NOR POWER CITIES


DID YOU CORRECTLY BUY AND USE YOUR RESOURCES ANY POWER PLANT CAN STACK UP TO THE DOUBLE OF ITS NEEDS A 2 CHARCOAL PLANT MAY HAVE UP TO CHARCOAL UNITS AND YOU HAVE TO SPEND THE RESOURCES TO POWER YOUR PLANTS THESE RESOURCES DON'T GO BACK TO THE RESOURCE MARKET AS THE MARKET IS REFILLED AT THE END OF THE TURN FOLLOWING A DIFFERENT SCHEME DEPENDING ON THE BOARD STEP AND NUMBER OF PLAYERS DID YOU CORRECTLY REFILL THE RESOURCES MARKET
WE HAD EVERYTHING WE NEEDED TO POWER HOMES WE JUST HAD TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE GOT THERE

THE GAME ONLY ENDS AT CITIES OR HOWEVER MANY

YOU CAN STILL BUILD MORE THAN CITIES THAT'S WHY THE TRACK GOES TO

THE GAME IS SCORED BY WHO CAN POWER THE MOST CITIES


IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU CAN BUILD AND POWER CITIES YOU STILL BEAT THE PERSON WHO BUILT CITIES AND POWERED OF THEM

WE PLAYED POWER GRID ON SATURDAY OURSELVES IT TURNED INTO A GAME OF BIDDING WARS LAND GRABS AND MARKET DOMINANCE
HM AS I DIDN'T WATCH YOU PLAYING HARD TO SAY

JUDGING FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION JUST CHECKING THAT YOU ONLY POWERED YOUR OWN HOMES REMEMBER YOU HAVE ONLY THREE SLOTS FOR POWER PLANTS LESS OBVIOUS DID YOU ALWAYS SORT THE SPARE ROW OF POWER PLANTS BY PRICE PUTTING THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE UNDER THE PILE POWERING CITIES WITH THREE STATIONS CAN ONLY BE DONE WITH QUITE EXPENSIVE PLANTS WHICH YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EQUIP YOURSELF AT LEAST NOT ALL OF YOU BEFORE STAGE STARTS
WERE YOU PLAYING POWER GRID OR POWER GRID DELUXE HERE ARE SOME RULES TO DOUBLE-CHECK

UNTIL STEP ONLY THE TOP ROW OF POWER PLANTS IN THE MARKET CAN BE AUCTIONED THE POWER PLANT MARKET IS ALWAYS ORDERED BY MINIMUM BID

YOU CAN HAVE MAX POWER PLANTS AT A TIME

IN THE BUREAUCRACY PHASE YOU ONLY GET INCOME FOR THE NUMBER OF HOUSES YOU POWERED THAT TURN USE UP RESOURCES FOR YOUR POWER PLANTS THOSE POWER PLANTS CAN POWER X NUMBER OF YOUR HOUSES THIS TURN

TO BUILD IN A CITY YOU MUST PAY FOR BOTH THE HOUSE IN THE CITY AND CONNECTION COSTS TO THE CITY FIRST HOUSE IN A CITY COSTS SECOND COSTS THIRD COSTS

IN STEP ONLY ONE HOUSE CAN BE IN EACH CITY IN STEP 2 ONLY TWO HOUSES IN STEP UP TO THREE
IF YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THOSE COOL TEMPLES FOR OR SOMETHING ELSE
IF YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THOSE COOL CLIPS FOR BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL TO REPLACE THE BAD ONES THAT COME IN THE GAME OR SOMETHING ELSE
IN THE TIME IT TOOK ME TO CLICK THE LINK NOTE THE CODE AND ADD SOMETHING TO CART THE DEAL EXPIRED

THOSE CLASH OF CULTURES WONDERS WENT FROM UNDER AUD TO OVER
IT'S NOT BAD IT'S BETTER AT OR BUT PLAYABLE AT 2 THE NUMBER OF WORKERS AND CATTLE CARDS SCALE DOWN WITH FEWER PLAYERS THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE FEWER BUILDINGS ON THE BOARD IT CHANGES THE FEEL OF MOVING AROUND THE BOARD MAKES IT TOO EASY
IN ANOTHER COMMENT YOU SAID EVERYTHING YOU ARE READING SAYS IT'S NO GOOD FOR GENUINE QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU READING

ON BG PEOPLE SAY IT PLAYS BEST WITH PEOPLE RECOMMEND IT WITH AND ONLY 2 PEOPLE DON'T RECOMMEND IT WITH THOSE ARE VERY POSITIVE STATS FOR
I'VE PLAYED MULTIPLE TWO PERSON GAMES AND FIND IT BRILLIANT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED HERE WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT THE LOGISTICS OF GETTING AROUND THE BOARD MIGHT NOT BE AS COMPLICATED AS THREE OR FOUR PLAYERS I SUSPECT THAT THE TWO PLAYER COUNT WILL BE A SWEET SPOT FOR SOME GAMERS LOOKING FOR LESS TROUBLES ON THEIR TURN PLAYERS MAY ALSO LIKE THAT IT'S FASTER PACED
I HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED INTO THIS TITLE

HOW WAS THE PLAYTIME WAS THERE MUCH PLAYER CONFLICT INTERACTION
IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR A STRICTLY 2 PLAYER STAR TREK GAME I RECOMMEND FLEET CAPTAINS
CHECK OUT TICKET TO RIDE NORDIC COUNTRIES IT'S A MAP THAT'S ONLY PLAYERS SO IT'S DESIGNED FOR A MUCH TIGHTER 2 PLAYER GAME
THE EXPANSION HAS A BIG CITIES SET OF TICKETS THAT BASICALLY HAVE ALL THE TICKETS CONNECT TO THE SAME FIVE OR SIX CITIES WHICH TIGHTENS UP THE MAP FOR TWO PLAYERS
ME AND MY WIFE JUST PLAY WHERE WHY EACH CONTROL TWO COMPANIES THAT ARE INDEPENDENT IT GIVES YOU A LOT MORE TO THINK ABOUT AND THE BOARD ACTUALLY GETS CROWDED SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO PLAN OUT YOUR ROUTES ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU ARE COMPETING WITH YOURSELF IN SOME WAYS
BUY ONE OF THE PLAYER MAPS PROBLEM SOLVED
IT IS USED TO CLASSIFY THE MOVE TYPES

GREEN IS A SYMMETRICAL MOVE

BLUE IS A MOVE THAT GOES TO THE LEFT

RED IS A MOVE THAT GOES TO THE RIGHT
FOR ME IT WAS SPECTER OPS SAW IT AT BARNES AND NOBLE FOR HALF OFF ITS ORIGINAL PRICE AND WAS LIKE EH WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN

TURNS OUT IT IS A FANTASTIC GAME
SMASH UP WASN'T REALLY MY CUP OF TEA
YOU WON'T REGRET BUYING DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG IT'S MY FAVORITE AND I'D PLAY IT EVERY DAY IF I COULD

MY ANSWER IS PROBABLY THE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY I KNEW OF IT AND I KNEW IT IS VERY AND REVERED I LOVED THE CARD GAME VERSION SO WHEN I SAW IT FOR I SNAGGED A COPY AND DON'T REGRET IT ONE BIT

I ALSO INSTINCTIVELY BOUGHT MULTIUNIVERSUM WHEN I NOTICED IT WAS BY MANUEL CORREIA TURNS OUT TO BE A GREAT GAME SYSTEM AND I ACTUALLY LIKE IT MORE THAN THE AGENT DECKER HE RELEASED I EVEN CROWDFUNDED THE CTHULHU EXPANSION FOR IT

I HAVE BOUGHT TONS OF GAMES WITH VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE SOMETIMES I JUST LOOK AT RATINGS THE PLAYER COUNTS THE GAME LENGTH AND A COUPLE PICTURES AND THAT CAN SELL ME ON A GAME I'VE MOSTLY BEEN LUCKY SO FAR
THE SWARM I SAW SOME OF THE ART ON IT AND KNEW IT WAS BASED ON SOME VERY POPULAR GERMAN BOOK BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I COULDN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT IT AT THE TIME I THINK THIS WAS BEFORE I WAS AWARE OF BG OR R BOARDGAMES BUT SAW IT SELLING FOR LIKE OR SOMETHING AND FIGURED WHAT THE HECK

STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT TO THE TABLE YET THOUGH
I BLINDLY PURCHASED EXPLODING KITTENS BECAUSE OF ALL THE HYPE WORST GAME IN MY COLLECTION
WHEN TARGET WAS DOING THE BUY 2 GET I PICKED UP OREGON TRAIL WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF IT BEYOND THE PREMISE OF THE COMPUTER GAME BUT IT IS A TON OF FUN AND REALLY CHALLENGING
AT ESSEN THIS YEAR I BOUGHT A GAME CALLED A DOG'S LIFE FOR LITERALLY NO OTHER REASON THAN THE FACT IT HAD CUTE DOG FIGURES I AM A SUCKER FOR DOGS I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET AND HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IF I EVER WILL

U GETINFO
AN INFAMOUS TRAFFIC ORDERED THE FIRST DAY IT WAS AVAILABLE I KNEW IT WAS A TOUGH ECON GAME THAT WAS OPAQUE AT BEST THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT I NEED ONE MORE PLAY OF IT BEFORE I'M READY TO PASS JUDGEMENT BEFORE THAT MIGHT BE TRADERS OF OSAKA I GOT IN A TRADE WITHOUT RESEARCHING IT MUCH BEYOND READING THE DESCRIPTION AND CATEGORIES ON BG HAVEN'T PLAYED THAT YET
THE VERY LAST GAME FOR ME WAS DESCENT THAT WAS TODAY DON'T HAVE IT YET LOL I ALSO ORDERED LANCASTER BIG BOX AFTER READING ABOUT IT ON MUSD I SWEAR THEY HAD A VIDEO FOR IT BUT CAN'T FIND ONE SO I GUESS I READ IT ON THEIR SITE

I PURCHASED AMERIGO ON VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OTHER THAN IT WAS DIRT CHEAP NOT THAT LONG AGO AND PRETTY FUN IVE PLAYED IT TIMES I THINK AND IT WILL BE A WHILE BEFORE I MASTER IT AND I DID LIKE IT

I GOT FORBIDDEN DESERT BECAUSE ITS A CO OP TILE LAYING GAME LIKE BURGLE BROS AGAIN IT WAS ON SALE AND IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET

ARE YOU SEEING A TREND
I DO IT ABOUT BUYS MY HUNCH VERY RARELY IS OFFICIAL I AM LOOKING AT YOU MUNCHKIN
I'VE ONLY BOUGHT ONE MAINOR OFF A CLEARANCE TABLE DIDN'T CARE FOR IT MUCH AND TRADED IT AWAY

I'VE ACCEPTED SEVERAL AS TRADES THOUGH WITHOUT KNOWING MUCH IF ANYTHING ABOUT THEM

ALMOST A GOOD GAME BUT NOT QUITE TRADED IT AWAY
AGE OF CONAN THE STRATEGY BOARD GAME STILL HAVEN'T PLAYED IT
LUNGARNO NICE LITTLE TILE GAME NOT GREAT BUT I'M KEEPING IT IN MY COLLECTION
VENTURA STILL HAVEN'T PLAYED IT
BLACK FLEET NOT TOO BAD IT'S A KEEPER BUT PROBABLY WON'T GET PLAYED VERY OFTEN
LONG LIVE THE KING READ THROUGH THE RULES AND DECIDED I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO TRY IT TRADED IT AWAY
HOMESTEADERS I LIKED IT AT FIRST BUT IT GOT TOO CAMEY AND TOO MATHY IT STOPPED BEING FUN AFTER A FEW PLAYS TRADED IT AWAY

OH AND ALSO WON A COUPLE FROM RAFFLES

ACTUALLY KINDA FUN TO PLAY WITH KIDS
AMONG THE STARS ANOTHER ALMOST GAME A LOT OF COOL IDEAS THAT JUST DIDN'T QUITE WORK FOR ME I TRIED ADDING IN THE FIRST COUPLE EXPANSIONS AND THAT ACTUALLY MADE IT WORSE IT'S STILL TAKING UP SPACE ON MY SHELF SINCE I CAN'T SEEM TO TRADE IT AWAY

SO MY TRACK RECORD ISN'T GREAT I TRY TO RESEARCH EVERYTHING BEFORE GETTING IT NOW
FIRST OF ALL SKULL IS AMAZING AND IT MIGHT BE THE MOST PLAYED GAME IN MY COLLECTION SO MUCH SO THAT IM THINKING OF BUYING ANOTHER COPY

MY LAST BLIND PURCHASE WAS DOGS OF WAR I SAW THE COMPONENTS READ THE MUSD REVIEW AND DECIDED TO JUST BUY IT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE GAME PLAYS BUT I THINK IT WILL WORK WITH MY GROUP IT DIDNT ARRIVE YET SO I HAVE NO IDEA
I ORDERED QUANTUM AS IT WAS ON A BIG SALE SOMETHING LIKE OFF AND HAD ONLY READ COMMENTS ON THE WEBSITE

I THEN FOUND THAT MUSD MADE A REVIEW OF THE GAME AND WAS RELIEVED SINCE I USUALLY HAVE SIMILAR TASTES AS THEY DO

THE COMPONENTS MATERIAL CAN SEEM A BIT ODD BUT I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED THE GAME IS GREAT

STILL I AM MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS WHEN ORDERING GAMES NOW I LOOK UP SEVERAL REVIEWS AND CHECK COMMENTS ON BG SO LESSON LEARNED WHILE GETTING A GOOD GAME WIN WIN
IT WAS THE FIRST GAME I BOUGHT I KNEW I WAS GONNA LIKE THE HOBBY SO I DOVE RIGHT IN AND BOUGHT CAVERN ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS A HEAVY BOX

NOW I'M OVER GAMES IT WAS A NICE BLIND BUY
SKULL IS A VERY MPH GAME FOR ME I CAN SEE WHY OTHERS LIKE IT BUT THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH GOING ON TO HOLD MY ATTENTION YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME WITH BAR COASTERS AND A SHARPIE

AS FOR MY LAST BLIND BUY MY FAGS HAD A BLACK FRIDAY SALE WHERE THEY THREW A BUNCH OF THEIR UNSOLD TITLES UP ONTO A TABLE FOR OFFICIAL I PICKED UP DIMMET SABOTEUR AND SABOTEUR 2 FOR THREE BUCKS A PIECE I ENJOYED THE FIRST ONE BUT HAVEN'T ACTUALLY PLAYED THE OTHERS YET
SINCE I'M A BROKE COLLEGE STUDENT I DON'T GET MUCH CHANCE FOR BLIND BUYS BUT THE LAST ONE I DID GET WAS THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON PRETTY GOOD GAME I NEED TO FIND OUR INVENT SOME WAYS TO MAKE IT MORE DESTRUCTIVE BUT STILL GOOD
ARCTIC SCAVENGERS WAS POSTED ON MY LOCAL FB TRADE GROUP FOR HALF THE PRICE OF RETAIL SO I JUMPED ON IT BECAUSE I HEARD THROUGH PEOPLE ON HERE THAT IT WAS NEAR THE TOP OF THE PILE WHEN IT COMES TO THE DECKBUILDER GENRE I THOUGHT DOMINION WAS FUN BUT DRY SO THE IDEA OF THE SAME MECHANICS WITH A BETTER THEME GOT ME EXCITED ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I'VE EVER MADE I LOVE IT GROUP LOVES IT SO LOVES IT
I BOUGHT JAILBREAKER PLAN YOUR ESCAPE ON KICKSTARTER AND I KINDA REGRET IT THE GAME IS DECENT BUT THE RULES ARE REALLY BAD WE HAD TO HOUSE RULE LIKE OUT OF THE ITEM CARDS DUE TO LACK OF CLARITY
I BOUGHT HARRY POTTER BATTLE WITH VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT BUT THAT TURNED OUT PRETTY WELL PLAYED IT ABOUT TIMES SO FAR AND I STILL ENJOY IT
MOST OF GAMES WERE BOUGHT THIS WAY THE LAST ONE IS MOMBASA I HAVEN'T OPENED IT YET
JUST TRY IT WITH THEM AND SEE LOTS OF BAD GAMES HAVE PLENTY OF FANS THEY MAY JUST LOVE IT
I ENJOYED IT SILLY FUN EASY TO LEARN
IT IS NOT A GOOD GAME FOR ADULTS AND UNFORTUNATELY MANY REVIEWERS WILL REVIEW IT FROM AN ADULT PERSPECTIVE I'VE NEVER PLAYED IT WITH KIDS BUT I COULD SEE THEM ENJOYING IT IT HAS SIMULTANEOUS PLAY WITH ONLY TWO DECISIONS PER ROUND SO IT MOVES QUICKLY AT LEAST AND HANDLES MORE PLAYERS BETTER THAN GAMES WHERE EVERYONE TAKES A TURN

IF YOU CAN GET YOUR KIDS INTO THE CHUMULU THEME I COULD SEE IT AS GOOD SILLY FUN MAYBE ENCOURAGE THEM DO A CHUMULU FACE EVERY TIME THEY PLACE THEIR MONSTER
MY HOUSE I HAVE IT NEVER PLAY IT ONLY LOOKED AT THE CARDS A FEW TIMES MESSAGE ME MAYBE WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT I'LL EMAIL YOU PICTURES OR SOMETHING
BEEN LOOKING FOR MINE OVER A YEAR NOW THINK I GAVE IT AWAY OR LEFT IT AT A PARTY ETC DEFINITELY FUN IN A GROUP TEAMS
ITM RMVSB TRUE

ITM RMVSB TRUE

ITM RMVSB TRUE
YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T LOOK TOO HARD ON AMAZON BECAUSE IT'S LISTED FOR

TRY AGAIN IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT
I PLAYED THE ESCAPE THE ROOM GAME YOU LINKED TO LAST AND IT WAS JUST MY WIFE AND I PLAYING IT WAS OVER IN UNDER AN HOUR AND WE JUST BREEZED THROUGH IT IT WAS PRETTY MUCH A WASTE OF MONEY IN MY OPINION
I KICKSTARTED ESCAPE ROOM IN A BOX BUT STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY COPY THE REVIEWS SEEMED TO BE PRETTY GOOD THOUGH WHICH WAS A BIG PART OF WHY I BACKED IT I PLAYED ESCAPE THE ROOM MANOR AND IT WAS WAY TOO SIMPLE FOR OUR GROUP IT SAYS TWO HOURS BUT WE WENT THROUGH IN ABOUT MINUTES AND WERE NEVER REALLY CHALLENGED BY THE PUZZLES BUT IT WAS ONLY SO IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON PLAYING WITH KIDS OR SOMETHING FOR A FAMILY NIGHT IT WOULD WORK WELL I HAVEN'T HEARD OF ESCAPE ROOM THE GAME BUT AM NOW INTERESTED IN CHECKING IT OUT
ESCAPE THE ROOM HAS MORE BUT SIMPLER PUZZLES ALSO HAS MANY MORE PHYSICAL COMPONENTS TO PLAY WITH

ESCAPE ROOM THE GAME HAS FOUR THEMED ROOMS IN THE BOX THE PUZZLES ARE DEFINITELY HARDER AND THE KEY CHECKING SYSTEM IS NICER TOO

BOTH GAMES CAN BE RESET AND REPACKAGED TO SELL ON ONCE YOU HAVE FINISHED HAVE HEARD THERE MAY BE EXPANSION PLANS FOR ERG THOUGH
I PLAYED TWO GAMES OF ESCAPE ROOM I REALLY LIKED IT AND IT WAS PRETTY CHALLENGING LOOKING BACK THE PUZZLES WEREN'T TOO HARD BUT WITH THE TIMER AND EVERYTHING IT MADE IT FUN
I WAS HOPING TO LIKE ESCAPE THE ROOM BUT FROM WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT SOUNDS PRETTY EASY
ACCORDING TO THIS THREAD THEY ARE SHIPPING ON WEDNESDAY NOV

I BELIEVE THAT OCCURS IN SO WE CAN EXPECT TO GET OUR GAMES IN ABOUT FOUR YEARS
THERE IS A PRETTY EXTENSIVE THREAD ON BG HOT DEALS ABOUT THIS NOT SURE WHAT THEIR CONCLUSION HAS BEEN BUT THEY AREN'T TOO HAPPY EITHER
I CAN'T REALLY WORK UP ANY INDIGNATION THEY PROBABLY GET A FEW ORDERS A WEEK MOST WEEKS THEN GOT A COUPLE THOUSAND AT ONCE I'M SURE I'LL GET MY GAMES

EDIT JUST GOT MY SHIPPING CONFIRMATION SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE TOMORROW
THANK YOU FOR CONTACTING FANTASY FLIGHT CUSTOMER SERVICE OH WAIT THIS IS JUST A FORUM HMM

I THINK AT THIS POINT YOUR GAME IS LOST FOREVER AND YOU SHOULD TAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND
TWEET AT THEM NOT REALLY DO YOU HAVE A RECEIPT
THEY CHARGED YOUR CARD I HAVE AN ORDER NUMBER BUT THEY HAVE YET TO TAKE THE MONEY
THEY GET THE GAMES FOR FREE THEY ALMOST CERTAINLY MAKE MONEY OFF THEIR REVIEWS BY WAY OF ADS OR HAVE OTHER REVENUE STREAMS LIKE KICKSTARTER PATRON MERCHANDISE ETC IF THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY GET THE GAMES FOR FREE PLEASE TOT UP THE COST OF THE GAMES THEY REVIEWED AND SEE WHAT KIND OF COST IS THEN INCURRED SET AGAINST THEIR REVENUE I'M BETTING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL BE

NOT PICKING ON YOU HC I THINK FREE COPIES FOR REVIEWERS IS THE NORM BUT I THINK A LOT OF REVIEWERS ARE ALSO DOING NOTHING MORE THAN UNOFFICIAL PR FOR THOSE GAMES THEY FEATURE THAT'S THE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY CURRENTLY JUST NOTE YOU GOT A REVIEW COPY PROVIDED BY THE PUBLISHER DESIGNER ETC AND MOVE ON NOTHING TO SEE HERE WHEN EVERY OTHER JOURNALIST AND CRITIC REFORMS AND STARTS PAYING FOR EVERYTHING JOIN THEM UNTIL THEN
I THINK YOU'RE GETTING A LOT OF NEGATIVE FEEDBACK HERE BECAUSE THIS POST IS BOTH VAGUE AND IMMEDIATELY STANDOFFISH

IF YOU'D STARTED WITH HEAVYCARDBOARD HERE WE'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF NEGATIVE COMMENTS RECENTLY MOSTLY ABOUT THE REVIEW COPIES THAT GAME PUBLISHERS SEND US WITHOUT COMPENSATION THIS WOULDN'T BE SUCH A WEIRD POST
WOULD YOU HAVE INVESTED YOUR TIME IN THE HOBBY OTHERWISE

I SPENT HOURS PLAYING GAMES OVER THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY ON GAMES THAT WERE PAID FOR

ARE YOU NOW STATING THAT YOU MAY IN FACT BE UNDERCOMPENSATED FOR YOUR REVIEW EFFORTS BECAUSE YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME AND ONLY GET YOUR NOT FREE GAME


BIG FAN OF THE SHOW BUT IF YOU DON'T PAY FOR A GAME THEN YOU GOT IT FOR FREE THERE'S AN EXPECTATION OF A REVIEW USUALLY BUT THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF FREE LOL
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU PLANNED TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS POST YOU JUST COME ACROSS AS YELLING AT CLOUDS FROM A POSITION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD FIND ENVIABLE

IF BEING GIVEN GAMES AT NO CHARGE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'LL PLAY THEM SEVERAL TIMES AND POST YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH THEM IS SUCH A BURDEN STOP DOING IT

I DON'T WATCH YOUR SHOW BUT IF THIS IS YOUR ATTITUDE ABOUT DOING REVIEWS I'M RATHER DISINCLINED TO TRY
THERE ARE SOME REVIEWERS FOR ANY PRODUCT THAT RECEIVES A PRODUCT FOR FREE USUALLY IT'S LARGER KNOWN REVIEWERS AND SAID LARGER KNOWN REVIEWERS HAVE ADVERTISEMENTS HAVE SPONSORS AND OR HAVE A PATRON PAGE NO ONE IS DOUBTING THAT YOU DON'T PUT WORK INTO THE REVIEW BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY LOVE BOARD GAMING SO IT PROBABLY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A BIG DEAL TO YOU WE LOVE BOARD GAMES AND WE LIKE HONEST REVIEWS THIS ISN'T SAYING NO ONE IS GIVING REVIEWS THAT AREN'T HONEST IT SEEMS LIKE A SMALL MINORITY OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT FREE GAMES
TO PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE JUST A BIT YOU ARE PAID FOR YOUR WORK ARE YOU NOT I MEAN IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF A VERY VERY PART TIME JOB BUT STILL I THINK THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF US WHO KIND OF PAY YOU ALL TO DO WHAT YOU DO RIGHT

REVIEW COPIES ARE FREE WHEN GIVEN TO REVIEWERS IN RETURN FOR A REVIEW YOUR TIME THAT YOU CHOOSE TO INVEST IN REVIEWING AND PLAYING IS IN FACT YOUR CHOICE TO DO ESPECIALLY IF THIS IS STILL JUST A HOBBY WITHIN A HOBBY AND NOT IN FACT A JOB LIKE SOME HAVE MADE IT

I MEAN COME ON IF YOU FELT AS IF THEY WEREN'T FREE WHY WOULD YOU FEEL THE NEED TO ARTICULATE THAT YOU WERE INDEED GIVEN A COPY FOR REVIEW BY SAID PUBLISHER I MEAN AFTER ALL YOUR TIME IS JUST AS VALUABLE AS YOUR MONEY RIGHT




I SERIOUSLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS UPSETS YOU IN TERMS OF MONEY YOU DO NOT PAY ANYTHING FOR THE GAME IN WHICH YOU RECEIVE SO BY DEFINITION IT IS FREE YOUR REVIEW TAKES TIME BUT ANY TIME AFTER THAT YOU OWN A GAME THAT YOU DIDN'T PAY FOR

SOME PEOPLE WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE IDEA OF BEING GIVEN A GAME THAT THEY MIGHT BE BUYING ANYWAY TO TAKE THE TIME TO PLAY AND REVIEW IT WHICH THEY MIGHT BE DOING ANYWAY AND NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT YOU WERE THE ONE WHO CHOSE TO DO THIS AND HONESTLY I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HERE
TELL ME AGAIN HOW THAT'S FREE

IT'S FREE BECAUSE YOU SKIP THIS STEP
YOU PAY IN CASH

KINDA JOKING KINDA NOT BUT REALISTICALLY HOW MANY PEOPLE OUT HERE ARE SAYING REVIEWERS JUST GET TONS OF FREE STUFF FOR NOTHING YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT FOR GETTING IT BECAUSE YOU'RE A MEANS OF ADVERTISING FOR THE PUBLISHER THE GAME IS FREE TO YOU IN THE SAME WAY THE MARKETING IS FREE TO THE CASH IS EXCHANGED THE WAY IT TYPICALLY WOULD BE FOR BOTH THOSE THINGS BUT IT'S PAID FOR IN OTHER WAYS
WELL AS A CONSUMER THEN I GUESS I'M NOT ONLY SPENDING MONEY ON A GAME BUT ALSO SPENDING MANY MANY HOURS RESEARCHING GAMES WATCHING READING REVIEWS AND PARTICIPATING IN DISCUSSIONS ONLINE AND IRL NOT TO MENTION ALL THE TIME PLAYING GAMES WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT BOARD GAMES ARE INSANELY EXPENSIVE

I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE LIGHT OF YOUR ARGUMENT I DON'T BELIEVE REVIEWERS JUST SIT AROUND AND GET FREE STUFF BUT YOU'RE COMING ACROSS IN A NEGATIVE WAY IF YOU DON'T ENJOY WHAT YOU DO WHY DO IT IF YOU ENJOY WHAT YOU DO WHAT ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT
TELL ME AGAIN HOW THAT'S FREE

YOU HAVE GIVEN ZERO MONEY FOR THE GAME

SO AT A MINIMUM ABOVE THE TIME SPENT PLAYING THE GAME A REVIEWER AGAIN USING MYSELF AS THE EXAMPLE HERE IS SPENDING HOURS PER REVIEW COPY RECEIVED ON THEIR REVIEW

ARE YOU MAKING ANY MONEY FOR THIS DO ADVERTISERS OR SPONSORS PAY YOU ANYTHING

IN MY OPINION IF YOU ARE DOING IT AS A HOBBY WITHOUT RECEIVING PAY THEN YOUR TIME IS PAYING FOR THE GAME IF YOU'RE DOING IT AS A BUSINESS AND RECEIVE MONEY THEN YOU'RE BEING PAID FOR YOUR TIME
STOP PLAYING THE VICTIM ALL THE TIME THE REASON PEOPLE SAID ZOUG WHYYYYYY IS BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY HAD A VERY POORLY DEFINED CONVERSATION AND YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FURTHERMORE COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW YOUR THREAD IS RECEIVED ON REDDIN JUST MAKES YOU SOUND WHINEY
PLENTY OF PEOPLE DO REVIEWS FOR GAMES THAT THEY PAY FOR WITH CASH THEY AREN'T GETTING REVIEW COPIES SENT TO THEM IT'S PRETTY COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY GOT A GAME FOR FREE IT'S THAT THEY DIDN'T PAY CASH

FURTHERMORE A LOT OF COMPANIES OUTSIDE THE BOARD GAME REALM ACTUALLY PROHIBIT THIS PRACTICE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS IF YOU ARE RELYING ON A PUBLISHER TO PROVIDE GAMES THEN ARE YOU LESS LIKELY TO GIVE A BAD REVIEW CONSUMER REPORTS FOR EXAMPLE BUYS EVERYTHING THEY REVIEW INCLUDING CARS AT RETAIL IN SECRET ALSO NOBODY IS KEEPING ANY ITEMS AFTER THEY ARE REVIEWED

ALSO THIS ISN'T CHARITY YOU GUYS DO SELL ADS ON YOUR PODCAST AND YOU HAVE A PATRON SO ONE COULD ARGUE ALL THE TIME YOU SPEND ISN'T TO PAY FOR THE GAME IT'S TO GET LISTENERS SO YOU CAN SELL ADS OR PUT ON THINGS LIKE HEAVYCON
I REPLIED EARLIER BUT I FELT IT NECESSARY TO RESPOND TO THE EDIT IF THE OP CAME FROM POSTS ON BG AND TWITTER IT BEEN MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE TO LINK THE APPLICABLE DISCUSSION INSTEAD OF RANTING ON REDDIN IF YOU HAD FRAMED YOUR POST INTO HEY WE'RE HEAVY CARDBOARD AND THIS IS A TREND WE'RE SEEING IN THE REVIEWING COMMUNITY WHAT DO YOU THINK INSTEAD OF AN EMOTIONAL RANT IT WOULD HAVE GENERATED MUCH BETTER DISCUSSION

AND FWIW I LINKED THIS OVER ON TWITTER AND I WAS HIT WITH ZOUG WHYYYYY FROM MEDIA FOLKS AND REGULAR GAMES ALIKE THAT'S A SHAME ON SO MANY LEVELS

THIS EDIT LEGITIMATELY MADE ME MAD IT REEKS OF WAH PEOPLE ON REDDIN ARE BEING MEAN TO ME IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE DON'T BE HERE IF YOU WANT TO BE PART OF THE COMMUNITY AT R BOARDGAMES THEN DO SO TRY TO FIX WHAT YOU THINK IS WRONG TRY TO ADD POSITIVE DISCUSSION BUT INSTEAD YOU POST AN EMOTIONAL RANT AND EXPECT SYMPATHY WITHOUT CONTEXT GOOD GRACIOUS R BOARDGAMES IS FOR HOBBY BOARD GAMERS NOT FOR CONTENT CREATORS I DON'T SEE PEOPLE IN R NFL RANTING BECAUSE THEY AREN'T INCLUSIVE ENOUGH OF THE PLAYERS COACHES I REALIZE IT'S A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC BUT IT'S A VALID COMPARISON
REVIEW COPIES AREN'T FREE BECAUSE YOU ARE TIED DOWN TO YOUR CREDENTIALS AS A BOARDGAME REVIEWER THAT YOU WILL PLAY THEIR GAME AND GIVE A FAIR REVIEW OF IT WHETHER YOUR SUGAR COAT THE REVIEW OR NOT IS COMPLETELY UP TO YOU

HOWEVER THE GAME IS STILL TECHNICALLY FROM A MONETARY PERSPECTIVE IF WE DISREGARD TIME AND MATERIALS NECESSARY FOR THE REVIEW I AM NOT SAYING TIME AND MATERIALS ISN'T WORTH ITS OWN MONETARY VALUE BUT YOU ARE RECEIVING A BOARD GAME FOR FREE BECAUSE YOU DID NOT HAVE TO FORK OVER ANY PHYSICAL MONEY BUT STILL COSTS QUITE A BIT BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND MATERIALS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO AS A REVIEWER

TL R REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU DEFINE AS A FREE
WHEN A REVIEWER USING MYSELF AS AN EXAMPLE HERE RECEIVES A GAME THEY MAY DO AN UNBOXING VIDEO EITHER ON PERISCOPE OR THEIR YOUTUBE CHANNEL THEN THEY PLAY IT TIMES THEN THEY MAY SPEND UPWARDS OF HOURS WRITING THEIR NOTES OUTLINE SCRIPT FOR THEIR REVIEW THEN THEY RECORD THEIR REVIEW THEN THEY SPEND HOURS EDITING WHAT THEY RECORDED THEN THEY UPLOAD IT AND HAVE TO SPEND MORE HOURS PROMOTING THEIR REVIEW

NEVER HAS MY LIFE BEEN SUMMARIZED IN SUCH A DRY SAD PARAGRAPH
ARE REVIEWERS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO DO PUT IN THESE HOURS FOR THEIR REVIEWS MAYBE IT MATTERS THE PUBLISHER DDK HONESTLY ASKING


IF IT'S A CRAP GAME DO YOU PUT IN THOSE GAMES EVEN THOUGH IT'S CRAP IF IT'S A GREAT GAME AND YOU WOULD HAVE GOT IN THOSE GAMES REGARDLESS OF BEING A REVIEWER DOES THAT MATTER I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE EITHER WAY JUST QUESTIONS I HAD
ARE YOU REPORTING THESE GAMES AS PART OF YOUR BUSINESS PERSONAL TAXES IF NOT IT'S FREE
ETA FOR CONTEXT THIS CAME FROM VARIOUS POSTS ON BG AND TWITTER WHERE FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT INTEGRITY IN REVIEWERS AND WHAT REVIEWERS SHOULD DO WITH REVIEW COPIES OF GAMES WHEN THEY FINISH WITH THE REVIEW SOME FEEL THAT SELLING THEM IS OK OTHERS NOTSOMUCH DONATING THEM IS OK OTHERS SAY THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO WITH IT IT TAKES MONEY OUT OF THE PUBLISHERS POCKETS SO THAT'S WHERE THIS COMES FROM SORRY IF I POSTED THIS WITHOUT THAT CONTEXT

SO YOU'RE MAD PEOPLE ARE MAD AT YOU THINK YOU GET STUFF FOR FREE KING
I FIND IT SURPRISING MAYBE I SHOULDN'T AT HOW MANY MOST SEE COLD HARD CASH AS THE ONLY CURRENCY TO DEFINE FREE

IF I HAVE SOMEONE BUILD ME A FENCE AND INSTEAD OF PAYING THEM WITH CASH IN RETURN I FIX THEIR CAR WOULD YOU CONSIDER EITHER SIDE GETTING THOSE THINGS FOR FREE


I WOULDN'T BOTHER ATTEMPTING TO RATIONALIZE THE OPINIONS ON REVIEWS AND JOURNALISM IN GAMING IN THEY'RE TOO FAR GONE
I AGREE WITH OP YOU PROVIDED A SERVICE TO THE GAME PUBLISHER YOU ARE BEING PAID WITH A COPY OF THE GAME WHAT YOU DECIDE TO DO WITH THAT COPY IS UP TO YOU
YUP I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE HOW MUCH WORK GOES INTO THEM PLUS ALSO FINDING THE TIME TO REPLAYING THE GAME ALL THOSE TIMES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I MAKE APPEARANCES HERE AND THERE ON A PODCAST BUT I'D NEVER ACCEPT A REVIEW COPY OF A GAME TO EVEN REVIEW ON THERE WHERE SOMEONE ELSE DOES THE EDITING AND I JUST HAVE TO WAFFLE ON AS I KNOW I WOULDN'T WANT TO NOR PROBABLY BE ABLE TO PLAY IT ENOUGH TIMES QUICKLY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO GIVE IT A PROPERLY RESEARCHED REVIEW

I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE TIME ALL REVIEWERS PUT INTO THEIR REVIEWS AND I'M SURE IF YOU WORKED OUT THE HOURLY RATE OF TIME SPENT VS THE COST YOU'D BE ON LESS THEN MINIMUM WAGE THOUGH I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE REASON YOU DO IT ANYWAY
I CAN GET ON BOARD WITH THAT SENTIMENT REVIEWERS DO PUT IN ADDITIONAL WORK WHEN THEY GET A FREE GAME BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO REVIEW IT AND CREATE CONTENT WHICH IS A PART OF THAT LINE OF WORK IT OCCURS IN EVERY INDUSTRY AND WITH ALMOST ANY PRODUCT AND THE COST OF THE ITEM IS GENERALLY LESS THAN THE COST OF THE INVESTED TIME OF THE CONTENT CREATOR WHICH IS SOMETHING MOST FOLKS DON'T REALIZE UNLESS THEY'VE DONE WORK IN THE PAST

I ALSO THINK MOST FOLKS ALSO DON'T REALIZE THAT REVIEWERS NEED TO GET THROUGH THE GAMES THEY ARE SENT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND WHILE PLAYING LOTS OF GAMES IS FUN HAVING TO SLOT SPECIFIC GAMES INTO SPECIFIC TIMES AND A LOT OF THEM IS LESS SO EVEN IF YOUR AVERAGE GAME RUNS AND SOMEONE SPENDS ONLY HOURS ON A REVIEW PLAYS AND WRITE UP PRODUCTION THEY'VE EFFECTIVELY BEEN PAID AN HOUR TO CREATE THAT CONTENTION

SO FROM ONE DUDE WHO SPENT PROBABLY FIVE HUNDRED HOURS DOING FREELANCE WORK IN GRAD SCHOOL AND MADE ENOUGH FOR A FEW TANKS OF GAS AND A NICE DINNER HATS OFF TO YA
I CAN'T GET OVER HOW WELL ALCHEMISTS DOES THIS WHEN YOU SAY THINGS LIKE I'M PUBLISHING A THEORY ABOUT THIS INGREDIENT BASED ON MY RESEARCH AND I'M A BIT IFFY ABOUT PLACING MY MOST PRESTIGIOUS SEAL ON THIS THEORY SINCE IT IS BASED PARTIALLY ON THE YET UNPROVEN IDEAS OF MY OPPONENT YOU ARE DESCRIBING THINGS QUITE ACCURATELY IN TERMS OF BOTH MECHANICS AND THEME THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME TO GET ANY CLOSER TO THEME MECHANICS IN THIS GAME YOU'D NEED TO BE ACTUALLY MIXING REAL INGREDIENTS AND DRINKING THINGS IN REAL LIFE AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS NOT A PART OF THE GAME THOUGH IT COULD BE INTERESTING
VITICULTURE SEEMS EXTREMELY WELL THOUGHT-OUT TO ME EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO SEEMS TO FIT THE THEME AND MAKES SENSE TO ME
I'D SAY PRETTY MUCH MOST OF THE SIERRA MADRE GAMES TITLES ESPECIALLY THE PAX SERIES OF SMALL CARD GAMES WITH PAX RENAISSANCE BEING THE ONE THAT REALLY HAS MY ATTENTION LATELY I MEAN IT HAS EVERYTHING RELIGIOUS WARS PEASANT UPRISINGS JIHADS AND CRUSADES VASSALIZATION TRADE CONCESSIONS AND BANKERS YEAH YOU'RE A MEDIEVAL BANKER TRYING TO MANIPULATE EUROPEAN EVENTS OR AT LEAST SURVIVE THEM AND THE BOARD IS REALLY JUST A 2 X TABLEAU OF CARDS THEN AGAIN I'M A SUCKER FOR THE THEMES AND MIGHT BE A BIT BIASED I MEAN BIOS MEGAFAUNA HAS A VERY TACKED ON SCORING SYSTEM TO MAKE IT BARELY A GAME BUT ALL THE OTHER MECHANICS OF SPECIATION AND ADDING NEW GENETIC TRAITS OR EVOLVING INTO AN ENTIRELY NEW PHENOTYPE IS AS FUN AS PLAYING SICCITY DELUXE ADD IN POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS CONSTANTLY CHANGING BIOMES CONTINENTAL SEPARATION A CHANGE FROM MESOZOIC TO CENOZOIC AND THE CONSTANT THREAT OF GOING EITHER TO A HOT DEATH OR A SNOWBALL EARTH IN THE BACKGROUND ALL SUCK ME INTO THE NARRATIVE OF THE GAME IF ANYTHING PEOPLE PROBABLY MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SEEMING RANDOMNESS OF HIS GAMES BUT NATURE IS TRULY RANDOM AND CHAOTIC AS TO HIS MORE HISTORICAL GAMES THEY TAKE A DIFFERENT TWIST ON THE MOTIVES OF REVOLUTION OR THE AGENT YOU REPRESENT IN PAX PORFIRIANA YOU START OUT AS WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN WHO MOST LIKELY WILL TOPPLE THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT IN THE EARLY CENTURY IN PAX PAMIR YOU ARE A SMALLER AFGHAN TRIBES TRYING TO GAIN POLITICAL PROMINENCE IN THE SHADOW OF THE MIGHTY BRITISH AND RUSSIAN EMPIRES AS WELL AS A NATIONALIST MOVEMENT AND AGAIN IN PAX RENAISSANCE YOU ARE A BANKER THE FIRST AND LAST ARE BASED ON BOARD WAR GAMES OF THE LORDS OF THE SERIES SIERRA MADRE AND RENAISSANCE RESPECTIVELY

I ALSO HAVE TO SAY THE COIN SERIES IS ALSO REALLY GOOD THE IRREGULAR PIECES THAT FLIP BETWEEN UNDERGROUND HIDDEN AND REVEALED THE INEQUALITY OF MILITARY CAPABILITIES BETWEEN SIDES THE DIFFERENCE IN SPECIAL ACTIONS EACH FACTION CAN TAKE AND THE HIGHLY VARIED GOALS THAT TAKES TO ACHIEVE THEM THE NEXT TURN CARD GIVES YOU SOME FORESIGHT INTO UPCOMING POLITICAL EVENTS BUT YOU HAVE A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHEN YOU CHECK FOR VICTORY CONDITIONS

THE OF THEME MECHANICS FOR ME HAS TO BE TWILIGHT STRUGGLE EVERYTHING IN THAT GAME CREATES A TENSE TUG-OF-WAR FEELING WITH A SENSE OF IMMINENT NUCLEAR DOOM DESPITE BEING HIGHLY ABSTRACTED IN THE NATURE OF THE CONFLICTS MAYBE YOUR US POLICIES ARE FOCUSED ON EASTERN BLOCK COUNTRIES BUT THEN YOU DISCOVER THAT THE USSR IS PLAYING A LONG GAME AND BUILDING UP ALLIANCES IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND AFRICA WHILE HOLDING YOU OFF LONG ENOUGH IN EUROPE COUPS AND REALIGNMENTS CAUSE CONSTANTLY CHANGING GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS SOMETIMES ACTIONS WILL GIVE AN OPPONENT A STRONG RESPONSE PLAYING A CARD FOR OPS POINTS THAT HAS AN OPPONENTS EVENT TRIGGERS THAT EVENT THE SCORE TRACK IS A BACK-AND-FORTH SINGLE TRACK THAT EACH OPPONENT IS TRYING TO PULL TO THEIR VP SPOT AND THE DEFCON LEVELS RAISE NUCLEAR TENSIONS WHILE THE SPACE RACE AND THE CHINA CARD ADD MORE CONFLICT AND TENSION IN THE BACKGROUND MY PREFERENCE IS FOR DAWN OF FREEDOM WHICH COVERS THE FINAL YEAR OF EASTERN BLOC COMMUNISM THE COLD WAR AND THE YEAR THE BERLIN WALL CAME DOWN BUT WHEN TALKING ABOUT MECHANICS PLUS THEME TS HAS IS AND IS JUST A SYSTEM UTILIZING THE TS SYSTEM
CASH IN GUNS HAS THE THEME OF A MEXICAN STANDOFF AND ACTUALLY HAS PLAYERS DO A MEXICAN STANDOFF


BONUS POINTS THAT ALL THE CLASSIC GUNPOINT BANTER JUST NATURALLY SLIPS OUT WITH PLAYERS GOING YOU AIN'T GONNA PULL THE TRIGGER OR PUT THE GUN DOWN NOW AS YOU TRY TO OUT POSTURE AND OUT BLUFF EACH OTHER
I'VE ALWAYS FELT YEDO DOES A NICE JOB OF BLENDING THE MECHANICS WITH THE THEME
DUNE OH DUNE HOW I LONG FOR THE BACKSTABBING SPICE RICH WARTERN DIPLOMATIC QUAGMIRE OF A 2 TO PLAYER BEST WITH STRATEGY GAME IT FITS HAND IN HAND WITH THE MECHANICS REX IS A GREAT REIMPLEMENTATION RESKIN BUT DUNE IS DUNE
SOMEONE ELSE HAS POSTED ABOUT THIS ON BG BEFORE BUT THE GAME IS THAT PERFECT MARRIAGE

TO QUOTE FROM MEMORY WHEN I'M PLAYING THIS GAME I FEEL LIKE I'M PLAYING A GAME

I'VE PLAYED EUCHRE OVER A TIMES IN MY LIFE AND I'M STILL EXCITED EVERY TIME I GET TO PLAY IT AGAIN

BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA

MY FAVORITE WAY TO PLAY IS BLIND I JUST LIE ABOUT WHO I AM AND HOPE I HAVE THE RIGHT CARDS WHEN CALLED OUT
BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA BUT IT'S MORE LIKE I'VE PLAYED TIMES LITERALLY
PANDEMIC THE CURE VALERIA CARD KINGDOMS ARE THE TWO GAMES IN MY COLLECTION THAT HAVE OVER PLAYS

PANDEMIC THE CURE GETS A LOT OF PLAY DUE TO HOW QUICK THE SET UP IS AND HOW EASY IT IS TO RESET THE BOARD I MAINLY PLAY THIS 2 PLAYER WITH MY WIFE AND WHEN WE BREAK IT OUT IT GETS PLAYED MULTIPLE TIMES IN A SETTING THE RANDOMNESS OF THE DICE KEEPS THE GAME FRESH BUT THERE IS STILL ENOUGH PLAYER AGENCY THAT WE RARELY BLAME THE GAME FOR OUR LOSES I JUST PICKED UP THE EXPANSION THIS PAST WEEK BUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN A CHANCE TO PLAY IT YET VERY EXCITED

I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY VALERIA GETS PLAYED SO OFTEN I CAN'T REALLY PREACH ABOUT HOW PERFECT THE MECHANICS ARE BECAUSE I DEFINITELY THINK THE GAME HAS FLAWS BUT WE PLAY THIS GAME A LOT AND I'M ALWAYS EXCITED TO BUST IT OUT I JUST THINK THE GAME REALLY HITS A CHORD WITH MY GROUP AND ME THE ART IS FANTASTIC THE GAMEPLAY IS QUICK BASICALLY JUST AN UPDATE OF MACHI BORO AND IT'S VERY ACCESSIBLE I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE EXPANSION TO BE RELEASED
I'D PLAY BATTLETOWN CODENAMES AND GHOST STORIES ANY TIME DESPITE HAVING PLAYED EACH AROUND TIMES

I'LL REPLAY ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES HIGH SKILL OR HAS HIGH VARIETY

CHICAGO EXPRESS IS ONE THAT I AM ALWAYS UP FOR AND HAVE PLAYED IT A TON THE COOLEST THING ABOUT THE GAME IS THAT ONE SMALL AUCTION CAN COMPLETELY TRANSFORM THE GAME IF A PERSON DOES AN AUCTION IT CAN DISRUPT TEAMS AND INCENTIVES FOR INSTANCE IF YOU AND I BOTH OWN SHARE IN THE RED COMPANY WE WILL BOTH SPLIT THE PROFITS OF RED MAKING COOPERATION MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL IF HOWEVER ANOTHER RED SHARE WERE TO BE AUCTIONED AND YOU WIN IT THE SPLIT IS NOW MEANING YOU GET OF THE PROFIT WHILE I ONLY GET AT THIS POINT IT IS POINTLESS FOR ME TO HELP RED OUT AND NOT ONLY THAT I SHOULD SABOTAGE THE COMPANY SO THAT IT'S VALUE DOES NOT INCREASE THAT MUCH YOU ON THE OTHER HAND ARE GOING TO WANT TO BOOST THE COMPANY A TON BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT TO GAIN FROM IT AN AUCTION CAN ALSO CONTROL THE LENGTH OF THE GAME IF THERE IS ONLY ONE SHARE LEFT OF A COMPANY IT MAY END THE GAME IF IT IS AUCTIONED THE PLAYERS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE THE MOST MONEY WANT THE GAME TO END AND AS SUCH WILL AUCTION IT OFFICIAL IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE LESS MONEY THAN MANY PLAYERS YOU WILL WANT TO STOP AN AUCTION FROM HAPPENING BY TURNING THE AUCTION DIAL AND DOING NOTHING ALSO CALLED NULL ACTION THE GAME PLAYS FAST AND IT FITS THOUGH 2 IS NOT ADVISABLE AT ALL IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE IT PLAYS REALLY QUICKLY AND THE POWER OF A SINGLE AUCTION DOES SO MANY THINGS

I'M ALSO A BIG FAN OF MAGIC THE GATHERING I SAY THIS BECAUSE I MAKE DOZENS OF DECKS BUT I DON'T SPEND MORE THAN PER DECK BECAUSE OF THE FORMAT I PLAY BLOCK CONSTRUCTED GAMES ARE FAST AND I LOVE SEEING A STRATEGY FIRE OFFICIAL IF YOU HAVE A TON OF DECKS THE REPLAY VALUE IS ENDLESS

STILL A FEW PLAYS SHORT OF BUT THE VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO FOR SURE THE VARIABLE BOARD SETUP AND VARIABLE CHARACTER ROLES MAKE EACH GAME REALLY UNIQUE IT'S A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE EVERY TIME YOU PLAY
DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS NOT REALLY A BOARDGAME BUT IT'S WHERE BOARDGAMES LED ME
WHILE ITS NOT REALLY A BOARD GAME ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALL TIME GAMES IS MUNCHKIN
BATTLETOWN AND BOMI PROBABLY PLAYED A HUNDRED GAMES OF BOMI AND A THOUSAND OF BATTLETOWN AND NEITHER EVER GETS OLD
TALKING ABOUT ACTIVELY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I EAST I MAY SUGGEST THESE HANAFI AGE OF STEAM THE GREAT ZIMBABWE POWER GRID AND PELOPONNESE
FLUX AND A CHINESE VARIANT OF BANG CALLED SAN DUO SHA LEGEND OF THE THREE KINGDOMS THE RULES ARE BASICALLY THE SAME AS IN THE GAME BANG EXCEPT THERE ARE MANY MORE CHARACTERS TO CHOOSE FROM AND THEY ARE THEMED AROUND THE THREE KINGDOMS ERA IN CHINA I WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING THAT GAME OUT IF YOUR GROUP IS WILLING TO USE AN APP TO CHECK TRANSLATIONS OF THE CARDS INTO ENGLISH OR JUST TRY THE BASE GAME IN ENGLISH
ACTUAL BOARDGAMES NONE I BELIEVE SO FAR BUT WONDERS MIGHT BE GETTING CLOSE TO THAT NUMBER I BLAME ONE MOCO THAT GETS NEW GAMES EVERY WEEK

BUT ONLINE I'VE HAVE OVER TERRA MYSTIC GAMES AND ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF THROUGH THE AGES ANSON BOTH I WOULD GLADLY PLAY EITHER ONLINE OR NOT THOUGH I MUST SAY AFTER PLAYING THE CTA THIS SATURDAY I MIGHT BELIEVE IT IS BETTER OFF ONLINE THE MILITARY CAN BE A PAIN TO GET IT RIGHT SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAN COME FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOURCES
TINY EPIC GALAXIES
BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL I KNOW SOME PEOPLE GIVE THIS GAME SOME GRIEVE BUT I HAVE DEFINITELY PLAYED THIS GAME MORE THEN TIMES WITH MY GAME GROUP AND IT IS STILL ALWAYS ON THE LIST TO PLAY WHEN WE GET TOGETHER IT IS ALWAYS A DIFFERENT GAME EVEN IF WE GET A REPEAT OF THE HAUNT ESPECIALLY WITH THE EXPANSION I EVEN FIND IT AS A GATEWAY GAME FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT INTO THE HOBBY
DESCENT JUST FINISHED THE APP CAMPAIGN LAST NIGHT AND I'M ITCHING TO GET BACK INTO THE OVERLORD SEAT AFTER THE HOLIDAYS I'VE PLAYED INCLUDING 1ST EDITION AT LEAST FULL CAMPAIGNS PLUS LOTS OF OTHER ONE-SHOT GAMES

WONDERS DUEL SEES A LOT OF PLAYS THE RECENT EXPANSION DEFINITELY INVIGORATED MY ENJOYMENT FOR THE GAME

ECLIPSE

STONE AGE

ROOM
DOMINION
FORMULA D
HANAFI
THAT TRUST AND COMMUNICATION MANUAL
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY
MY TWO GO TO GAMES WHICH HAVE WELL OVER PLAYS EACH AND I ALWAYS ENJOY PLAYING AGAIN ARE INNOVATION AND GLORY TO ROME BLACK BOX EDITION
JUST ENOUGH STRATEGY AND DECISION MAKING TO BE ENGAGING AND JUST CHAOTIC ENOUGH TO BE ENTERTAINING EVERY TIME WE PLAY

SHORT STORY WE WERE PLAYING TEAM INNOVATION OVER THE WEEKEND MY TEAM WAS WELL BEHIND WE HAD MORE ACHIEVEMENTS BUT THE OTHER TEAM HAD A TON OF POINTS AND A GREAT MACHINE GOING AND WINNING ON ACHIEVEMENTS IN TEAM INNOVATION IS RARE
I HAD THE CHANCE TO GET FISSION ON THE BOARD AND DOGMA IT
I HAD CLOCKS OVER BOTH OF THE OTHER PLAYERS THEY BOTH HAD TO DRAW A AND IF IT WAS RED WE WOULD WIPE ALL BOARDS SCORE PILES AND HANDS
IT WAS GREAT COMPLETELY CHAOTIC AND OUR BEST OPTION AT THE TIME TO HAVE ANY CHANCE TO WIN
IF THE GAME ENDS DUE TO DRAWING OUT THE PILE IT'S HIGH SCORE TO WIN BUT ACHIEVEMENTS ARE THE TIE BREAKER OUR HOPE WAS TO DRAW OUT THE LAST FEW CARDS AND WIN ON A ACHIEVEMENT TIE BREAKER
UNFORTUNATELY THE OTHER TEAM MANAGED A FEW POINTS MORE THAN WE COULD BEFORE THE DECK WAS DRAWN OUT
ABSOLUTELY EXCITING ALL THE WAY DOWN
GOOD CHOICE ON WONDERS WE BURNED OUT AFTER ABOUT GAMES BUT EASILY MADE IT WAY PAST

DOMINION IS ALSO GOOD BUT KINDA CHEATS BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY EXPANSIONS SAME WITH PANDEMIC I DOUBT WE'D STILL BE PLAYING IF WE ONLY HAD THE BASE SET
IF YOU CAN GET ENOUGH PEOPLE WEREWOLF IS ALWAYS A GREAT GAME ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET THE DELUXE EDITION AND GIVE MOST PEOPLE FILES THAT JUST MESS WITH THE PEOPLE MY FAVORITE COMBINATION IS THE DRUNK WHO CAN'T TALK AND THE SPELLCASTER WHO MAKES PEOPLE NOT TALK FOR ONE ROUND
STAR REALMS IS THE MOST PLAYED GAME AT HOME WE CANNOT GET ENOUGH
SECRET HITLER NEVER GETS OLD WE ARE JUST TOO DAMN GOOD AT LYING TO EACHOTHER AND LOVE IT

SAME REASON WHY BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA REMAINS A FAVOURITE

BLOOD RAGE ISN'T TO THAT POINT YET BUT WE'VE PLAYED IT TIMES THIS WEEKEND
COUP I AM A SUCKER FOR BLUFFING GAMES IT'S FAST AND WICKED FUN
BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL IT HAS A MODULAR BOARD THAT YOU LAY OUT AS YOU EXPLORE NEW ROOMS AND YOU PLAY A DIFFERENT SCENARIO EACH TIME BASED ON WHAT TRIGGERS THE HAUNT THERE ARE LIKE HAUNTS IN THE BASE GAME PLUS YOU COULD JUST PICK A HAUNT IF YOU END UP WITH ONE YOU'VE ALREADY PLAYED
FOR ME AGRICOLA PUERTO RICO WAR OF THE RING SAMURAI SWORDS
INNOVATION BASE GAME ECHOES MY FAVORITE GAME AND I'M ALWAYS EAGER TO PLAY IT
SPLENDOR IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES MY SO AND OUR FRIEND GROUP CAN PLAY IT FOR HOURS GREAT BLEND OF STRATEGY AND LUCK OF THE DRAW
FOR ME IT'S BEEN BOTH

CONCORDIA VARIABILITY ON SETUP EASY TO TEACH DEEP GAME WITH STRATEGIC CHOICES I LOVE IT

MARCO POLO SAME REASONING BUT A BIT QUICKER
PANDEMIC BOTH THE ORIGINAL WITH ADD ONS AND LEGACY I JUST LOVE THE MECHANICS AND THE DRAMA AS WELL AS THE LAYERS OF OUR OWN GAME CULTURE WE'VE CREATED AROUND IT LIKE SHAKING HANDS AND CONGRATULATING EVERYONE IN A SLIGHTLY FORMAL MANNER EVERY TIME WE CURE A DISEASE IT ALSO TENDS TO LEAVE EVERYONE HAPPY AS IT'S A TEAM GAME
I'VE PLAYED BASE BLOOD RAGE ABOUT THIRTY TIMES THE BASE GAME WITH NO EXPANSIONS AND I'M DYING TO PLAY IT RIGHT NOW I JUST SIGNED UP FOR ADEPTION IN MARCH AND BOTH BLOOD RAGE TOURNAMENTS TAKING PLACE THERE WOO HOO
RUMMIKUB

NOTHING MORE SATISFYING THAN FINDING THAT PERFECT SETUP TO CLEAR YOUR ENTIRE RACK
MY CORE GROUP OF BOARD GAMERS TENDS TO WARM UP WITH THE RESISTANCE EVERY SINGLE TIME AND IT SEEMS THEY NEVER GET TIRED OF IT I STILL ENJOY IT
COSMIC ENCOUNTER AND SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE ARE THE ONLY MEATY GAMES THAT I KNOW I'VE PLAYED MORE THAN TIMES AND I WILL HAPPILY PLAY EACH OF THEM ANY TIME THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS MY FAVORITE GAME

I SAW TICKET TO RIDE MENTIONED AND I SECOND THAT ONE TOO
I'VE PLAYED MOST OF THE GAMES IN MY COLLECTION MORE THAN TIMES AND I STILL ENJOY THEM HOWEVER SOME HAVE BEEN PLAYED HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND DON'T QUITE ENGAGE ME LIKE THEY USED TO EVEN THOUGH I LIKE THEM THE ONES THAT CURRENTLY FIT THIS CRITERIA ARE

RAGE AWESOME GAME FOR A RANDOM NUMBER OF PLAYERS

BOSS MONSTER WHEN I'M ABLE TO GET PEOPLE TOGETHER TO PLAY ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME THE STRATEGY INVOLVED IS FUN AND ITS A FAIRLY SIMPLE GAME TO PICK UP USING ALL THE EXPANSIONS IS ALSO VERY FUN
SET IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES

THIS ONE IS GOING TO SOUND BUT FOR THE HEAVIER ONES FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE MY BOYFRIEND AND I HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER FOR SIX MONTHS WE'VE PLAYED IT ABOUT OR SO TIMES JUST BETWEEN THE TWO OF US WHILE LAZILY GOING ABOUT A SATURDAY NOT COUNTING THE NUMBER OF TIMES WE'VE DRAGGED IN OTHER FOLKS AT BOARD GAME EVENTS OR PARTIES
THROUGH THE AGES NEVER SEEMS TO GET OLD EVEN AFTER ROUGHLY PLAYS

HOKKAIDO IS SO GODDAMN RELAXING AND POSITIVE THAT I DON'T CARE IF I LOSE

DEAD OF WINTER I LOVE THIS GAME POSSIBLE TRAITOR MECHANICS SELFISH CO-OP IF PLAYED CORRECTLY GOOD GAME
COMBAT COMMANDER
BATTLETOWN AND SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE FOR ME

BATTLETOWN IS A DEEP FIGHTING GAME THAT IS EASY FOR NEW PEOPLE TO PICK UP I'VE GOTTEN SEVERAL PEOPLE IN MY CLASS HOOKED ON IT THEY'RE SMASH BROS PLAYERS BUT THEY CAN RECOGNISE HOW INVOLVED THE GAME CAN GET WITH ITS BACK AND FORTH

OTM ON THE OTHER HAND HAS A LOT OF VARIATION WITH ITS SHEER NUMBER OF DECKS SO MUCH THAT ANOTHER FEW HUNDRED PLAYTHROUGHS MIGHT NOT SEE ME GETTING EVERY VARIATION PLAYED GAMES CAN BE A BIT LONG BUT IT'S A HEROIC FIGHT AND A BIT OF A PUZZLE EACH TIME

I MUST HAVE INTRODUCED THIS GAME TO ABOUT PEOPLE

ONE OF THE GUYS IN MY GROUP AND I HAVE BEEN PLAYING STAR WARS ARMADA TIMES A MONTH FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT IT'S IN A WEIRD NICHE FOR US AND NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING I'D CONSIDER A LE CLASSIC GEM BUT WE JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH OF THE DAMN THING THE UPCOMING CAMPAIGN BOX WILL PROBABLY PUT US IN PURE SANDBOY MODE WE STILL LEARN NEW TACTICS AND STRATEGIES EVERY TIME WE PLAY AND ARE JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT NOW AS WE WERE OUR FIRST COUPLE SESSIONS
NOT REALLY BOARD GAMES BUT WE LOVE BANANAGRAMS AND FARL THEY'RE A LOT OF FUN AND NOT EXPENSIVE AT ALL
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE I HAVE PLAYED THE BOARDGAME DOZENS OF TIMES AND THE COMPUTER GAME I HAVE PLAYED COUNTLESS TIMES I AM ALWAYS EXCITED TO PLAY THAT GAME

ALSO THE ALLERGIST
CATAN MOST DEFINITELY FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE USUALLY ENDED BEFORE THE GAME BEGINS IT'S AN ALL OUT WAR THAT ONLY GETS MORE AND MORE COMPETITIVE
MAGIC THE GATHERING ESPECIALLY CUBE DRAFTING WE'VE DONE IT ONCE A MONTH OR SO FOR YEARS ALWAYS FUN

MAGE KNIGHT SOLO MY GAME WHEN I WANT TO HAVE A QUIET NIGHT IN I'M FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE GAME THAT THE DECISIONS AREN'T OVERWHELMING BUT STILL INTERESTING PLANNING OUT A DAY OR NIGHT HELPS CLEAR MY HEAD IT'S ALMOST CATHARTIC

DESCENT 2ND EDITION NOT SURE IF THIS COUNTS I'VE PLAYED THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN ON BOTH SIDES A FEW TIMES PLAYED ABOUT SCENARIOS MIGHT BE GETTING INTO RTL SOON
DESCENT JOURNEYS IN THE DARK EXPANSIONS WILL ALWAYS DO IT FOR ME THERE ARE ENOUGH WAYS TO SPECIALIZE THE HERO COMBINATIONS TO KEEP IT FRESH

WE PLAY WITH A SHOT CLOCK TO KEEP THE GAME PROGRESSING AT AN ENJOYABLE SPEED
ESCAPE THE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE I'VE PLAYED UP TO GAMES IN A SOLO SITTING EASILY SO HITTING WAS NOT A PROBLEM I HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED MANY OF THE I HAVE BUT I REALLY WANT TO

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF ALONG WITH THE DAYBREAK AND VAMPIRE

BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL SERIOUSLY I'VE PLAYED AROUND SCENARIOS OF THIS GAME SO FAR AND IT'S ALWAYS THE FIRST GAME MY GROUP GOES FOR
CV

FORBIDDEN STARS

KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER
WELL I AM CURRENTLY PLAYING GAMES OF TERRA MYSTIC ONLINE
BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL WITH THE EXPANSION IT HAS DIFFERENT STORIES TO PLAY OUT

SMALL WORLD CLASS AND ABILITY RANDOMIZATION HELP MIX THINGS UP

MARVEL LEGENDARY DIFFERENT HEROES VILLAINS AND SCENARIOS EACH TIME
NONE AS I DON'T THINK I'VE PLAYED ANY GAME TIMES
COSMIC ENCOUNTER

AFTER SITTING ON CE AND THE FIRST EXPANSION FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW I WAS READY TO GIVE UP HOPE ON THE OTHER EXPANSIONS EVER BEING TRANSLATED TO GERMAN
WELL GUESS WHAT THE GERMAN PUBLISHER JUST TRANSLATED THREE ADDITIONAL EXPANSIONS SO I WILL HAVE SO MANY ALIENS TO PLAY WITH
CAN'T WAIT
CATAN I'VE HAD SO MANY VICTORIES I NEVER FEEL OUT OF THE GAME AND DOWNTIME ISN'T BAD

COSMIC ENCOUNTER I HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS TIMES YET BUT YEAH IT ISN'T GONNA WEAR OUT
MONOPOLY
SWEET I'VE BEEN HOPING THEY WOULD OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCE THEIR ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE BEATING A DEAD HORSE
BELIER HAS FOUND A MONEY MAKER IN ONUS AND IT SHOWS WITH ALL THEIR SUBSEQUENT RELEASES UNDER THAT BRAND NAME HONESTLY THOUGH I WISH THEY WOULD STOP IT NOW BELIER HAD MY ATTENTION WITH SUBURBIA AND MAD KING LUDWIG AND ONUS WAS A GREAT PARTY GAME THEY NEED TO CONTINUE ON THE TREND OF CLEVER ORIGINAL GAMES AND FEWER DERIVATIVES

THOSE ARE 2 OF MY FAVOURITE PARTY CASUAL GAMES I WANT TO BE VERY EXCITED BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT BE NERVOUS
TED ALSPACH SEEMS TO POSSESS A RARE TALENT AMONG GAME DESIGNERS WHERE HE GETS WORSE AS HE CREATES MORE GAMES

ONUS AND DAYBREAK ARE FANTASTIC GAMES EVERYTHING ELSE AFTER THAT DUDS
SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL BE SIMILAR TO MURDER DECEPTION IN HONG KONG
HOWL 2
THIS GEEKIEST NEEDS ONE SPY ULTIMATE CODENAMES ADDING
HMM SPIES AND WEREWOLF IF ONLY THERE WAS A GAME THERE PERHAPS WITH A BOMB AND A NUMBER OF ROOMS GREATER THAN ONE
TED STOP JUST DESIGN AN ORIGINAL GAME
WOW THAT WOULD BE TWO GAMES I HATE WRAPPED INTO ONE BOX OF COMPLETE SUCK I GET THESE ARE SUPER POPULAR BUT SO FAR TH ONLY PARTY GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED THAT I LIKED WAS TELESTRATIONS
I ACTUALLY LIKE FANTASY FLIGHT RULE BOOKS BUT WHO KNOWS MAYBE I'M CRAZY IF YOU WANT AN AWFUL RULE BOOK JUST BUY ANY GAME
I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THEIR RULE BOOKS BUT THEN I'VE NEVER PLAYED SOME OF THE OLDER GAMES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE WORST OFFENDERS

ELDRITCH HORROR MAKES A GAME WITH A LOT GOING ON REALLY EASY TO LEARN MARKHAM CG HAS SOME SLIGHTLY WEIRD WORDING ON SOME CARDS BUT IT ALL MADE SENSE WITH A READ OF THE RULES

FOR REFERENCE USES FOUR AMMO MEANS YOU PUT FOUR RESOURCE TOKENS ON THE CARD TO REPRESENT AMMO THEN SPEND ONE EACH TIME YOU USE THE CARD ACTION TO FIRE IT
HAVE YOU PLAYED OTHER FFA GAMES THEIR LEARN TO PLAY AND RULES REFERENCE SYSTEM WORKS WELL FOR ME BUT I'M USED TO CROSS REFERENCING
FFA RULEBOOKS HAVE USED A VERY SPECIFIC STYLE OF WRITING OVER RECENT YEARS ESPECIALLY ONCE SHIFTING TO THE LEARN TO PLAY RULES REFERENCE FORMAT IT'S WEIRD THE FIRST TIME AROUND BUT EACH TIME YOU LEARN AN FFA GAME YOU'LL FIND IT EASIER TO LEARN THE NEXT GAME AND THE NEXT GAME AND SO ON BY NOW I ACTUALLY LOVE THEIR RULEBOOKS AND FIND THEM QUITE CLEAR

THE TRICKY PART IS KEEPING THE TERMINOLOGY STRAIGHT BETWEEN THEIR GAMES AS A NETRUNNER PLAYER I CONSTANTLY FIND MYSELF REFERRING TO MY MARKHAM HORROR CG ACTIONS AS CLICKS AND THEN I USE THOSE CLICKS TO INSTALL MY ASSETS
THE MARKHAM HORROR CG RULEBOOK NEEDS A REVISION OR TWO TO INCREASE THE CLARITY OF THE RULES

BUT OVERALL I REALLY ABSOLUTELY PREFER THE RULES REFERENCE STYLE ONCE WE GET A ROUND OR TWO IN OF A GAME IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO GO TO THE EXACT SECTION IN THE RULES REFERENCE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO HUNT DOWN THAT ONE LINE YOU REMEMBER FROM THAT ONE RULE SOMEWHERE IN THE BIG RULEBOOK HAD THAT PROBLEM THE LAST TIME WE PLAYED BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA IN FACT

OF NOTE IS THAT MACHS VS MINIONS HAS A VERY GOOD IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEARN TO PLAY AND RULES REFERENCE SPLIT THE RULES REFERENCE IS LITERALLY A COPY PASTE OF HOW YOU ENCOUNTER THE RULE ORIGINALLY VIA THE OR MISSION BOOK
FANTASY FLIGHT HAVING BAD RULEBOOKS AND NONEXISTENT BOX INSERTS ARE LIKE THE TWO THINGS CONSTANT IN THE HOBBY EVEN THEIR SIMPLER GAMES OFTEN HAVE CONFUSING LAYOUTS THAT MAKE THEM MORE DIFFICULT THAN THEY NEED TO BE

FOR A FEW OF THEIR RECENT GAMES THEY'VE PUT OUT VIDEO TUTORIALS THAT ARE A MILE BETTER THAN THEIR RULEBOOKS BUT MOST OF THEIR GAMES YOU JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT
I DON'T MIND THEIR RULEBOOKS THE WORST FFA RULEBOOK IS A MILLION TIMES BETTER THAN THE RULEBOOK FOR 1ST EDITION ROBINSON CRUSOE
FFA IS KNOWN FOR PUTTING IMPORTANT RULES IN SIDE BARS AND CAPTIONS IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING SOMETHING CHANCES ARE IT'S IN AN INSERT AND LOOKS LIKE A PICTURE CAPTION OR EXAMPLE
BIT OF A HARSH ONE BUT A LOT OF THE PLAYERS YOU FIND IN PUBLIC BOARDGAMEY PLACES ARE WELL WEIRD

WHEN A NEW GAME STORE OPENED NEARBY I STARTED VISITING WEEKLY TO PLAY NETRUNNER STAR REALMS OR WHATEVER ELSE WAS ON THE TABLE AT THAT TIME WITHIN A MONTH IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT I'D CLASSIFY AT LEAST HALF OF THE PLAYERS AS SOCIALLY INEPT ANOTHER AS PRETTY AWKWARD AND THEN THERE WERE THE GUYS WHO DIDN'T SEEM TO DO ANYTHING EXCEPT PLAY THEIR GAME OF CHOICE YOU KNOW THE TYPE ONLY PLAYS ONE GAME DOESN'T TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE UNGROOMED CAN RECITE ANY GIVEN ERRATA FROM THE PAST YEARS FROM MEMORY DOESN'T KNOW YOUR NAME DESPITE SEEING YOU EVERY WEEK

THE REMAINING WERE COOL I GUESS UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE ALSO THE ONES THAT STOPPED SHOWING UP FAIRLY QUICKLY PRESUMABLY FOR THE SAME REASONS CLOSED NOW

I'M ALL FOR PLAYING GAMES AND I'M ALL FOR BEING INCLUSIVE BUT WHEN WE CAN'T HAVE A NORMAL RELATED CONVERSATION FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET ALONG
SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO BE INCLUSIVE SOMETIMES I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING LONG AND COMPLEX THAT MEANS I DON'T ALWAYS WANT YOU YOUR FRIEND OR YOUR SO TO JOIN NOT IF THEIR LIMIT OF COMPLEXITY IS CARCASSONNE

EDIT IN BROADER TERMS I'M FOR BRINGING IN MORE PEOPLE INTO THE HOBBY AND ALL THAT OFTEN I'LL HAPPILY AND EVEN SUGGEST A LIGHTER GAME BUT THERE IS ALSO AN ITCH PLAY A GAME THAT EXHAUSTS MY MENTAL CAPACITY TO THE FULLEST


I LOVE STUPID SILLY GAMES WITH SIMPLE RULES JUST AS MUCH AS I LOVE HEAVY GAMES I LIKE PLAYING GAMES WITH FAMILY AND KIDS SOMETIMES SOMETHING EASY LIKE SECOND RULE GUESSTURES OR SMART ASS IS AS GOOD AS GAMES WITH MORE DEPTH
WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE THE ART OF KLEMENS FRANZ IT'S LUMPY AND UGLY AND IT'S KIND OF A BIG TURN OFF THAT PREVENTS ME FROM GETTING AND PLAYING GAMES I'D OTHERWISE THINK I LIKE
I PREFER READING BOARD GAMES REVIEWS THAN WATCHING A VIDEO REVIEW


YOU CAN MAKE MILLENNIUM BLADES SOMEONE'S GATEWAY GAME

PELOPONNESE BOX ART IS COMPLETELY FINE

CODENAMES AND PANDEMIC LEGACY SHOULDNT TAKE THESE MANY AWARDS
I STRONGLY DISLIKE PANDEMIC
LONG BEFORE I KNEW OF THE INTERNET BOARDGAME CULTURE I PLAYED IT WITH AN OBSESSED FRIEND AND THOUGH IT WAS CO-OP I FELT LIKE HE WAS JUST PLAYING MY TURN FOR ME BY TELLING ME THE OPTIONAL MOVE

I LATER LEARNED THE TERM AND FIGURED THIS WAS WHY I HAD SUCH A LUKEWARM RESPONSE ANOTHER FRIEND PICKED UP A COPY SO I DECIDED TO PLAY WITH HER AND HER CREW THERE WAS NO SINGLE PERSON DICTATING THE BEST MOVES FOR ME TO MAKE THIS TIME THERE WAS A CHORUS

SO I TRIED IT ONE LAST TIME THINKING I NEED A GROUP WHERE PEOPLE DON'T ALL PUSH EACH OTHER INTO MOVES AND WE ALL DISCUSS A DEVELOPING STRATEGY THIS TIME IT WAS ALWAYS ME MAKING SUGGESTIONS AND DIRECTING PEOPLE IT JUST NEVER FELT LIKE WORKING TOGETHER IT FELT LIKE TAKE AND GIVE ORDERS THE GAME

THEN LATER IN LIFE I DISCOVERED BOARD GAME GEEK AND I WAS HONESTLY ASTOUNDED BY THE WORSHIP PANDEMIC RECEIVES

WHICH PUTS ME IN THE UNPOPULAR OPINION BRACKET THOUGH I RESPECT THOSE THAT ENJOY IT I'LL NEVER TAKE UP THE STOP LIKING THINGS I DON'T LIKE MENTALITY

STRIVE LEST OUR COMPANY BE LAZY COWARDLY MANURE
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INTO BOARD GAMES THAT TAKE IT WAY TOO SERIOUSLY AND MAKE IT LESS FUN FOR OTHER PLAYERS

I PLAY TO HAVE FUN NOT TO WIN AND I ENJOY PLAYING GAMES OF ALL LEVELS WEIGHTS HOWEVER I FIND MYSELF ONLY PLAYING LIGHTER WEIGHT GAMES MORE OFTEN THAN NOT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE I LIKE TO PLAY GAMES WITH ONLY LIKE LIGHTER FARE AND PROBABLY FOR THE SAME REASONS I MOST PEOPLE WHO PLAY HEAVIER GAMES ARE INSUFFERABLE I'VE TRIED TO FIND LIKE-MINDED HEAVIER PLAYERS WHO AREN'T INSANELY COMPETITIVE AND PRONE TO RIDICULOUS AP WHILST PLAYING HEAVIER GAMES IT'S NOT FUN FOR ME TO SIT FOR MINUTES WHILE YOU ANALYZE EVERY POSSIBLE MOVE ON THE BOARD BEFORE MAKING YOUR TURN AND THEN ONCE YOU'VE MADE YOUR MOVE YOU SAY OH WAIT I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING BETTER AND WANT TO TAKE YOUR WHOLE TURN BACK I MAKE MISTAKES AND SUB OPTIMAL MOVES ALL THE TIME WHEN I'M PLAYING BUT WHEN I NOTICE THEM I JUST NOTE IT FOR THE NEXT TIME I PLAY AND LIVE WITH MY CHOICE

I JUST WANT TO ENJOY THE COMPANY OF MY FRIENDS AND PLAY FUN LOOKING BOARD GAMES I DON'T WANT TO SPEND HOURS GETTING MY ASS THOROUGHLY DESTROYED AND SPENDING MOST OF THAT TIME WAITING FOR THE OTHER PLAYER TO PICK OUT THEIR MOVES EACH TURN
ALL METAL COINS AND POKER CHIPS ADD TO A GAME IS PEOPLE ANNOYINGLY TAPPING THEM TOGETHER OR AGAINST THE TABLE CONSTANTLY
I DON'T THINK SMASHUP IS THAT GOOD OR EVEN THAT FUN

IT REALLY FEELS COMPLETE RANDOM TO ME AND SOME FACTIONS ARE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN OTHERS AND SOME COMBINATIONS OUTRIGHT UNBEATABLE ROBOTS ZOMBIES GUARANTEED WIN
THEME DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL GIVE ME A BORING EURO WITH A NEW TWIST ON MECHANICS AND SOME WOODEN CUBES INSTEAD OF MINIS
I THINK COLLECTING BOARD GAMES AND NOT PLAYING THEM IS JUST FINE
QUARTERBACKING IS FINE I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY A GAME ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER THEN SIT THERE WHILE YOU ACTIVELY LOSE THE GAME WITH A MOVES

THAT BEING SAID I THINK THERE ARE TACTFUL WAYS TO APPROACH SUGGESTING A BETTER MOVE THAT CAN SATISFY BOTH SIDES OF THIS ARGUMENT AND IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE OUT SUGGESTIONS YOU DAMN WELL BETTER BE WILLING TO TAKE THEM TOO
I HATE MEEDLESS

WE'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE THE WORLD THAT BOARD GAMES AREN'T JUST FOR CHILDREN AND WE ARE TRYING TO SHED THE IMAGE OF IT BEING AN IMMATURE PURSUIT AND HERE WE HAVE A FUCKING DUNLO BLOCK AS OUR MASCOT
I WOULDN'T MIND PLAYING MONOPOLY


I JUST DON'T GET THE APPEAL OF LEGACY GAME
I THINK I HAVE SEVERAL OPINIONS WHICH THIS SUBREDDIT WOULD DEEM UNPOPULAR LET US BEGIN

I LIKE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY I DON'T THINK IT'S THE BEST GAME OR EVEN PARTY GAME EVER MADE BUT I LIKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS IT IS A SILLY AND VERY SIMPLE JOKE GENERATOR AND NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE FOUL-MOUTHED IN ORDER TO BE FUNNY YOU CAN JOKE ABOUT POLITICS SOCIETY PHILOSOPHY RELIGION AND A LOT OF OTHER SERIOUS THINGS IN THAT GAME AND STILL WIN IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE PEOPLE YOU'RE PLAYING NOT THAT YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING IT TO WIN YOU SHOULD BE PLAYING IT SIMPLY TO HAVE FUN AND LAUGH

2 I DON'T MIND IF PEOPLE BEND THEIR CARDS SURE I WOULD BE HAPPIER IF THEY DIDN'T DO THAT BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SILENTLY FUME OVER IT

I HATE THE TERM GATEWAY GAME SINCE IT IMPLIES THAT PLAYERS EVENTUALLY ALWAYS SURPASS THESE GAMES FOR MORE COMPLEX AND STRATEGIC ONES YES THEY'RE GOOD FOR INTRODUCING PEOPLE TO THE HOBBY ALTHOUGH YOU COULD INTRODUCE PEOPLE WITH HEAVIER GAMES IS THEY'RE INTERESTED ENOUGH

I DON'T LIKE SOME OF THE TRENDS WHICH I'M SEEING IN THIS HOBBY NAMELY THAT PEOPLE ARE OVERHOPING CERTAIN GAMES TO THE POINT THAT THEY'LL DO ANYTHING THEY CAN TO RATIONALIZE THEIR OPINION EVEN IF DEEP DOWN INSIDE THEY DON'T LIKE IT ALSO TOO MANY GAMES INFLATE THEIR PRICE COMPLETELY UNNECESSARILY BY INCLUDING MINIATURES AND OTHER GIMMICKS LIKE LIMITED REPLACEABILITY A KING A LEGACY ELEMENTS AND GAMES LIKE TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES JUST SO THEY CAN FORCE BOARDGAMERS TO BUY MORE OF THEIR EXPANSIONS

I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR WONDERS I THINK IT'S A POORLY EXECUTED ATTEMPT AT A CIVILIZATION GAME WHOSE MAIN SELLING POINT IS THAT IT GOES UP TO PLAYERS
THIS HOBBY IS FULL OF HOARDERS AND CONSUMERIST JUNKIES HOW MANY GAMES DO I OWN IN SHRINK PSHA LET'S BUY MORE YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY EVERY EXPANSION TO A GAME YOU DON'T PLAY SO IT FEELS COMPLETE IS YOUR HOBBY PLAYING GAMES OR BUYING GAMES MOST OF US ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH GAMES TO HAPPILY PLAY FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BACK GAMES A YEAR ON KICKSTARTER YOU'RE GIVING AN INTEREST FREE LOAN FOR A YEAR TO A COMPANY LIKE QUEEN EAGLE GRYPHON OR BMG THAT TREATS KICKSTARTER LIKE A SYSTEM FOR ALL THEIR GAMES THOSE EXCLUSIVES DON'T EVEN MIX WELL WITH THE GAME HALF THE TIME
VICTORY POINTS AS A WIN CONDITION IS A HUGE DESIGN WART

THIS IS MOSTLY ABOUT GAMES THAT REQUIRE POINTS SO NETRUNNER SPLENDOR SETTLERS OF CATAN ARE ALL FINE

USUALLY SCORING GAMES ARE JUST DRUNKEN STUMBLE PLAYERS HAVE NO CLEAR GOAL SO THEY DO A BIT OF EVERYTHING IN THE GAME AND FEELS BANDBOXY AND AIMLESS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE WHERE YOU ARE COMPARED TO OTHERS SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO MAKE RISKY MOVES TO CATCH UP OR SLOW DOWN AND CONSOLIDATE WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE

THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY THESE GAMES IS TO DO IT MULTIPLE TIMES WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO DEVELOP KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT'S WORTH DOING AND WHAT'S NOT WHICH NEVER WORKS FOR ME I WANT TO PLAY DIFFERENT GAMES ALL THE TIME WE PLAY WITH MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS AND PLAYING A GAME TIMES IN A ROW IS JUST NOT AN OPTION

BOTTOM LINE IF THE GOAL OF THE GAME CAN'T BE TRANSLATED INTO SOMETHING TRACTABLE OR AT LEAST REDUCED TO LOW NUMBERS I THINK IT'S JUST LAZY DESIGN
MARVEL LEGENDARY IS VASTLY OVERRATED BOTH IN COMPARISON TO OTHER BOARD GAMES AND EVEN THE LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS GAMES THE SET-UP AND TAKE DOWN IS A PAIN IN THE ASS THE CARD COMBO SYSTEM IS NEEDLESSLY CLUNKY THE COMPETITIVE BUYING POOL STRUCTURE FOR A COOPERATIVE GAME IS AN UNRELENTINGLY STUPID IDEA AND THE THEME IS TACKED ON EVEN MOST REVIEWERS SEEMS TO SAY SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF WHILE I THINK THE OTHER LEGENDARY GAMES ARE IN FACT BETTER GAMES I JUST LIKE THIS ONE BETTER BECAUSE IT'S MARVEL THEMED THE FACT THAT THIS GAME OFTEN GETS COMPARED TO AND RATED HIGHER THAN SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE IS OUTRIGHT CRIMINAL
I HATE SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN THEY SEEM MORE INVESTED IN TRYING TO CONVINCE US THEY'RE REALLY CLEVER THAN REVIEWING GAMES THEY AREN'T FUNNY AND THE SKITS ARE LUDICROUS
LOGGING GAME PLAYS IS THE WEIRDEST MOST OBSESSIVE ACTIVITY I CAN IMAGINE

CMC POSTS ARE A WEIRD ACT OF

FRETTING OVER PSIG IS FOOLISH BUY WHAT YOU WANT NOT WHAT STRANGERS ON THE INTERNET WANT YOU TO BUY
CODENAMES IS MASSIVELY OVERRATED AND DIDN'T DESERVE A SPIEL WIN
MAN HARD TO STAY UPBEAT AND POSITIVE WHILE REPLYING TO THIS KIND OF POST BUT I'LL DO MY BEST

FIRST EITHER I'M WAY OFF BASE OR I THINK THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HERE ARE JUST A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF GAMER THAN ME I DON'T HAVE A REGULAR CREW I SPEND OF MY GAMING TIME WITH FAMILY OR CLOSE FRIENDS NONE OF WHOM ARE GAMERS AND GETTING ANYTHING HEAVIER THAN A GATEWAY TO THE TABLE SEEMS LESS LIKELY THAN JUST ABOUT ANYTHING I CAN IMAGINE

THAT BEING SAID I THINK I PREFER GATEWAY GAMES I'M NOT A COMPETITIVE PERSON I DON'T ENJOY INVESTING MY ENTIRE EVENING OR WEEKEND INTO A SINGLE GAME I DON'T ENJOY DECISIONS THAT END UP FEELING LIKE WORK I DON'T GET ANY SATISFACTION FROM WINNING AND HAVING PROGRESSED THROUGH MY OWN PROVE I'M SMARTER THAN EVERYBODY PHASE IN MTG I FIND IT EXTREMELY DISGUSTING AND OFF-PUTTING WHEN I RUN INTO ANYBODY WHO DOES GET ENJOYMENT OUT OF WINNING OR EVEN MORESO ANYBODY WHO'S CHILDISH ENOUGH TO NOT ENJOY ANYTHING THEY'RE NOT WINNING

I DERIVE NEARLY ALL OF MY SATISFACTION FROM THIS HOBBY BY SHARING IT WITH OTHERS AND SEEING THAT LIGHT COME OVER THEIR FACES IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME THEY'VE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE WHEN THEY STEP OUTSIDE OF THE REST OF THEIR LIFE AND GET WHY I LIKE BOARDGAMES SO I GUESS WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS I REALLY LIKE CONVERTING PEOPLE INTO GAMERS BUT I RARELY LIKE GAMERS AS LONG AS ANYBODY IS LESS OF A GAMER THAN ME I ENJOY BEING AROUND THEM AND EDUCATING THEM BUT AS SOON AS I RUN INTO SOMEBODY WHO THINKS THEY'RE MORE OF A GAMER THAN ME I LOSE INTEREST IMMEDIATELY
IN MY OPINION IF YOU BEND CARDS YOU'RE THE DEVIL MY FRIENDS THINK I'M JUST BEING RIDICULOUS BUT I'M STANDING FIRM
LORDS OF WATERDEEP ACTUALLY IS VERY THEMATIC AND INCORPORATES THE THEME WELL

SUBURBIA WHILE BEING A GREAT GAME IS ABSOLUTELY NOT SIM CITY IN A BOX

MAGIC IS STILL A BETTER GAME THAT MOST GAMES
GAMES THAT GAMERS LOVE THAT I EITHER CAN'T STAND OR THINK ARE MPH

KING OF TOKYO SUPPOSED THEMATIC GAME OFTEN COMES DOWN TO JUST ROLLING DICE FOR VICTORY POINTS

AGRICOLA THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TIGHT AND RESTRICTIVE AND THIS GAME IS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LINE LOATHE HOW YOU LOSE POINTS IF YOU DON'T HAVE AT LEAST ONE COW ONE SHEEP ETC

CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG AP INDUCING AND CLUNKY THE BUILDER CAN LOOK AT EVERY PERSON'S NEEDS AND SPEND MINUTES ON PRICING

PANDEMIC IT'S NOT BAD BUT NOT SPECTACULAR

SUSHI GO FUN FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES THEN I'M READY TO MOVE ON CAN'T GET PLAYING THIS OVER AND OVER

COUP RANDOM GUESSWORK OVER AND OVER

BONANZA TRADING GAMES THAT GO ON FOREVER GIVE ME A HEADACHE

MYSTIC VALE DESPITE CARD CRAFTING FEELS LIKE A VANILLA DECKBUILDER WITH NOT ENOUGH CARDS IN THE DECK AND SOME BALANCE ISSUES

TERRA MYSTIC POWER WHEEL THINGY IS GAMEY AND STUPID SETUPS CAN BE IMBALANCE DEPENDING ON RACE SELECTION
HATING CATAN IS PAR FOR THE COURSE THE UNPOPULAR OPINION AT LEAST ON REDDIN AND BG WOULD BE TO LIKE IT WHICH I DO

THE WEEKLY MEGA THREAD IS POINTLESS INSTEAD OF TOPICS BEING VISIBLE ON THE FRONT PAGE AND CLEARLY DELINEATED THEY'RE BURIED IN THAT THREAD I DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH IT AT THIS POINT
I ENJOY CARCASSONNE BUT THERE IS A MARRIED COUPLE I REGULARLY GAME WITH WHO ADORE THE GAME AND HAVE BOUGHT PRACTICALLY EVERY SINGLE EXPANSION AND INSIST THAT WE PLAY WITH SAID EXPANSIONS WHENEVER WE PLAY I NOW FIND THAT I LOATHE PLAYING THE GAME WITH THEM AS IT GETS OVERLY COMPLICATED WITH SO MANY MINOR RULES ADJUSTMENTS AND ULTIMATELY IT EXTENDS THE GAME TIME SO MUCH SO THAT I FEEL IT OUTSTAYS ITS WELCOME

I ALSO HATE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY AS IT'S NOT REALLY A GAME BUT I SEEM TO BE IN THE MINORITY ON THIS IN MY GAMING GROUP I KEEP TRYING TO PUSH SAY ANYTHING AS AN ALTERNATIVE AS THERE IS ACTUALLY A GAME THERE AND MANY OF THE QUESTION CARDS COULD BE INTERPRETED TO BE RISQUE IF YOU DESIRED WITHOUT IT BEING FORCED ON YOU CH
SAD I GOT TO THIS THREAD SO LATE I HAVE TWO BIG ONES THAT HAVEN'T ALREADY BEEN SAID BY OTHERS SO MUCH

I NEVER KICK-START I SEE ITS POTENTIAL AND I THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR SOME PROJECTS BUT FOR THE MOST PART I SEE IT AS THE STUPIDEST GAMBLE A CONSUMER COULD EVER MAKE THEY PRETEND TO BE AN INVESTOR IN EXCHANGE FOR A PRODUCT THAT DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD ENOUGH CONCEPT TO SECURE TRADITIONAL FUNDING GRANTED SOMETIMES BOARDGAMES ARE TOUGH TO SELL TO A TRADITIONAL PUBLISHER BUT THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT THIS SPACE CAN BE BRUTAL AND TRULY GREAT GAMES ARE TRULY RARE THIS SPACE IS BRUTAL PRECISELY BECAUSE

IF BOARDGAMES ARE MOVIES AND TELEVISION THE FAGS IS BLOCKBUSTER THIS SHIP HAS SAILED WE AS CONSUMERS ARE INCREDIBLY LUCKY TO HAVE A WIDE VARIETY TO PICK FROM BUT THAT SAME VARIETY HAS MADE SHOPS IRRELEVANT WHEN I BOARD GAME SHOP I CLICK THROUGH AMAZON I READ REVIEWS FIND PLAYTHROUGHS AND RESEARCH IF I CAN AFFORD A BOARD GAME I SURE AS HELL CAN AFFORD TO PLAY IT SOME PLACE NICER THAN THE DINGY LITTLE GAME SHOP WITH A BODY ODOR PROBLEM BOARD GAME CAFES SEEM TO BE CATCHING ON BUT THEY HAVE THE ADDITIONAL DIFFICULTY OF COMPETING AS RESTAURANTS ALWAYS DIFFICULT AMAZON ISN'T JUST ENDANGERING THE FAGS ELECTRONICS SHOPS EVEN BEST BUY ARE HAVING TROUBLE AS A RESULT OF THIS BUSINESS MODEL IT'S EXTREMELY CONSUMER FRIENDLY GIVE ME WHAT I WANT AT A CHEAPER PRICE AND YOU'LL PUT IT ON MY DOORSTEP IN TWO DAYS TIME HELL YEAH ADDED BONUS NO SMELLY PEOPLE WELL I MEAN THERE'S MY DOG BUT SHE SMELLS PRETTY GOOD FOR A DOG AND ISN'T A PEOPLE
TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE MECHANICS AND I THINK THE THEME OF FANTASY IS A HUGE MISS THINK OF ALL THE GREAT TIME TRAVEL STORIES THERE HAVE BEEN ADDING FANTASY MONSTERS AND MAGIC WAS NOT NECESSARY AT ALL I CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW DISAPPOINTING THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN MY GROUP REALIZED WE WERE PLAYING A FANTASY GAMES WITH MONSTERS IN IT

MYTHOS TALES AND MANSIONS OF MADNESS 2ND EDITION EACH TAKE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF IT AND JUST DO IT WAY BETTER
I THINK AGRICOLA IS MUCH BETTER THAN CAVERN AGRICOLA HITS THAT ITCH FOR A HARD STARVING WORKER PLACEMENT GAME CAVERN COMES OFF AS A PARTIAL POINT SALAD WHEN COMPARED TO AGRICOLA I HAVE OTHER GAMES THAT FIT MY POINT SALAD CATEGORY
OF THE GAMES ARE UGLY

AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT ORIGINAL THROUGH THE AGES MOST OF THE GAMES LOOK LIKE THEY'RE DRAWN BY SOME GROWN UP FANTASY SCIFI FANATIC ILLUSTRATOR BE IT SOME UNKNOWN PUBLISHER OR FFA I LIKE NETRUNNER BUT ONLY BECAUSE I LIKE CYBERPUNK SO MUCH AND WHAT GRINDS MY GEARS THE MOST THERE IS SO LITTLE VARIATION IN STYLE IT'S ALL DRAWN THE SAME IT'S PRETTY MUCH DOMINATED BY TWO STYLES FANATIC FANTASY ALL OF FFA DAYS OF WONDER ETC AND MINIMAL HIP KICKSTARTER EXPLODING KITTENS TINY EPIC AND THE ILK

A COUPLE OF EXCEPTIONS

IAN O'TOOLE VINOS DELUXE EDITION IS BEAUTIFUL AND HIS OTHER GAMES ARE VERY NICE I LIKE WHAT I SEE FROM LISBOA SO FAR ALTHOUGH A BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE VISUALS AS AN ACTUAL GAME MOSTLY WORRIED THAT IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO MAKE EVERYTHING OUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL OTHERWISE
SECRET HITLER SERIOUSLY GOOD WORK ON THE BOARDS AND COMPONENTS
GLORY TO ROME BLACK BOX ONE DAY I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO BUY IT UNTIL THEN IT LOOKS NICE IN THE PICTURES

THIS SUB NEEDS TO TAKE A RIFF OFF OF R SQUAREDCIRCLE AND HAVE A ZERO FUCKS FRIDAY GET OUT YOUR WEEKLY GAMING FRUSTRATIONS ALL AT ONCE
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY IS A LOT OF FUN WITH CLEVER PEOPLE
COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE WORST THINGS I HAVE EVER PLAYED THIS IS HOW I'VE DESCRIBED IT BEFORE TAKE A TURN ACHIEVE NOTHING DON'T USE YOUR POWER BECAUSE IT'S SO CONTEXTUAL HOPE YOU GET ANOTHER TURN WAIT MINUTES WHILE EVERYONE ELSE TAKES THEIR TURN GAME ENDS BEFORE YOU GET A SECOND TURN

USING DICE TO RESOLVE THINGS SEEMS A BIT LAZY SURE IT CAN REPRESENT UNCERTAINTY OR A ONE IN A MILLION LUCKY SHOT BEING PULLED OFF BUT IF MY GIANT ELITE DUDE IS SHOOTING AT YOUR CRAPPY GRUNT AND I CAN'T HIT ONCE BECAUSE OF AN UNLUCKY DICE ROLL THAT'S NOT FUN OR UNCERTAINTY THAT'S FRUSTRATING AND BADLY DESIGNED
I THINK ORLEANS IS GARBAGE

I THINK SCYTHE IS MEDIOCRE UNPOLISHED AND ENORMOUSLY OVERRATED

I THINK GAMES WITH TEN THOUSAND CARDBOARD CHITS AND FIFTY OPTIONS PER TURN ARE OVERDESIGNED AND NEED THE BOARDGAME VERSION OF A GOOD EDITOR FEAST FOR ODIN IS A GOOD EXAMPLE

I THINK SPLENDOR IS FINE BUT CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ON THIS SUB LOVE IT SO MUCH

I THINK KICKSTARTER IS MOSTLY A TOILET IDIOTS FLUSH MONEY DOWN

I THINK BOARDGAME REVIEWS ARE AWFUL IT'S RULES EXPLANATION RAMBLING AND VAGUE OPINION ON THE GAME WITHOUT MUCH REAL INSIGHT THE SHINING EXCEPTION IS ALL THE GAMES YOU LIKE ARE BAD IF I WANT A RULES BREAKDOWN I'LL READ THE RULEBOOK OR MAKE THAT A SEPARATE VIDEO I WANT A REVIEW TO TELL ME HOW A GAME ACTUALLY IS
CATAN AND EMET ARE BEST AS 2 PLAYER GAMES
I LIKE THE BOX ART FOR CONCORDIA THUNDERSTONE ADVANCE IS BETTER THAN DOMINION IF YOU DON'T MAKE THE CARDS FACE THE RIGHT WAY YOU'RE HUMAN GARBAGE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY AND MUNCHKIN CAN BE FUN SOMETIMES I LIKE HOW KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER LOOKS UNPAINTED MORE
I'M BORED OF HEARING ABOUT KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER I UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IT AND IT'S MEANT TO BE A FANTASTIC GAME BUT IT'S BEEN TAKING OVER EVERY SLIGHTLY RELATED DISCUSSION RECENTLY I THINK THE LAST STRAW WAS WHEN TWO OF THE KICKSTARTERS I AM INVOLVED IN JUST NOW DARK SOULS AND DEEP MADNESS WERE BOTH FULL OF ADM COMMENTS
IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GAME NOBODY IS STOPPING YOU BUT MAKE YOUR OWN THREAD PLEASE AND DON'T SWAMP OTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH IT
LEGACY GAMES I JUST CANNOT NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES PEOPLE DEFEND AND EXPLAIN IT WRAP MY HEAD AROUND PAYING TWICE AS MUCH OR MORE FOR A VERSION OF A GAME THAT GIVES ME LIMITED USE AND NO RESELL VALUE AS OPPOSED TO A GAME WITH VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED REPLACEABILITY EXPANSIONS AND STILL BE ABLE TO RESELL OR TRADE IT WHEN I'M FINISHED FOR OTHERS TO ENJOY
CHESS IS NOT VERY FUN
I REALLY AM NOT WORRIED IN THE SLIGHTEST IF PEOPLE DAMAGE MY GAMES BY ACCIDENT I FIND IT REALLY RATHER PETTY WHEN PEOPLE DO FREAK OUT ABOUT THIS SO OK A DRINK SPILT ON THE CARD THERE ARE SO MANY OPTIONS TO DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION DRY IT OFF AND MOVE ON LET THE PERSON BUY A NEW ONE ASK COMPANY FOR A REPLACEMENT IT'S A BOTHER SURE BUT WORRYING ABOUT THIS FOR THE REST OF TIME AND IMPLEMENTING STRONG RULES AROUND PEOPLE BEING ALLOWED TO DRINK NEAR A GAME IS JUST RIDICULOUS CHANCES ARE YOU ARE TREATING GROWN ADULTS LIKE CHILDREN AND EVEN CHILDREN HATE THAT KIND OF TREATMENT INTENDED DAMAGE IS A WHOLE OTHER THING THOUGH AND I GIVE CONCESSIONS TO CERTAIN GAMES I E PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NO DRINKS ON THE TABLE DURING JUNGLE SPEED

I DON'T MIND RANDOM ELEMENTS IN GAMES IN FACT I LOVE THEM

UNBALANCED GAMES DO NOT BOTHER ME AS LONG AS EVERYONE HAS A FAIR CRACK AT GETTING THE OVER POWERED STUFF I'M LOOKING AT YOU SMALL WORLD

I ADORE WORN COPIES OF GAMES THEY FEEL LOVED USED AND HAVE SOUL

I HATE CARD PROTECTORS THEY FEEL CLUNKY TAKE AWAY FROM THE BEAUTY OF SO MANY GAMES AND ARE A REAL PAIN IN THE ASS TO SHUFFLE THEY ALSO TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY TO FIT A GAME BACK IN THE BOX CORRECTLY IN THOSE RARE OCCASIONS A BOX HAS ANY SEMBLANCE OF DECENT DESIGN

PEOPLE NEED TO STOP TALKING ABOUT HOW GOOD A GAME IS AND TALK ABOUT WHY IT IS INTERESTING INSTEAD MYSELF INCLUDED
THIS MIGHT BE STEPPING ON SOME TOES BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS TOPIC IS FOR THE RESISTANCE IS A BORING MECHANICAL PILE OF GARBAGE WITH NO THOUGHT REQUIRED THE FACT THAT IT NEEDED A BUNCH OF EXPANSIONS AND THEN HAD TO BE REWORKED INTO A NEW GAME JUST PROVES MY POINT
I THINK TWILIGHT IMPERIUM IS THE WORST GAME EVER MADE AND I LOVE SPACE GAMES IT WAS HOURS OF DIPLOMACY WITH MIN OF COMBAT AND THERE WAS OOOO MUCH DOWNTIME

RACE TO THE GALAXY BUT THIS IS A ME PROBLEM MORE THAN ANYTHING I JUST DON'T GET THE STRATEGY AND AM NO GOOD AT IT
ANIS LOOKS TERRIBLE TO ME I DON'T LIKE THE ART STYLE AND THE DESIGN OF THE TILES IT MAY BE DONE WELL FOR THE ART STYLE BUT IT ISN'T FOR ME THROW THE DRAFTING MECHANICS AND THE WEIRD COMBAT OF THE GAME ON TOP OF THAT AND I LOSE ALL STEAM

WOO ALREADY DOWNVOTED FOR SHARING AN UNPOPULAR OPINION ON A THREAD FOR UNPOPULAR OPINIONS AND BACK TO THE BASELINE
HAVING A LARGE COLLECTION WITH LOADS OF GAMES THAT ONLY GOT PLAYED ONCE OR NEVER IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY A BOARD GAMER IF THIS IS YOU YOU'RE A COLLECTOR
I REALLY REALLY ENJOY MUNCHKIN ITS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF IT

EVEN THOUGH ITS NOT REMOTELY BALANCED AND THE RESULT CAN BE FAIRLY RANDOM I JUST REALLY ENJOY THE EXPERIENCE AND ITS ONE OF THE GAMES I MOST ENJOY LOSING
I'M SICK OF BEING THE GUY WHO ALWAYS HAS TO READ THE RULES AND EXPLAIN THE GAME TO YOU IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THEN READ IT YOURSELF
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF IS JUST TOTAL GUESSING AND THEREFORE NOT A GAME AT ALL IF YOUR ROLE CHANGES EVERY TIME WHAT'S THE POINT AT LEAST THERE IS A COOL DEDUCTION YOU CAN MAKE IN MASQUERADE

CATAN IS REALLY BORING
ANDROID NETRUNNER IS EXCEEDINGLY BORING
HERE'S A CRAZY OPINION SEAWALL IS A GOOD GAME THERE I SAID IT
I DON'T GET THE COSMIC ENCOUNTER HYPE EVERY TIME I'VE PLAYED IT IT'S JUST FELT BORING OR UNBALANCED WHICH I'M TOLD IS PART OF THE APPEAL THE LATTER PART

I'M SURE WITH THE RIGHT GROUP AND RACES I COULD LOVE IT THOUGH MAYBE I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER SPIN
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH LIGHT OR PARTY GAMES IF THAT'S NOT YOUR CUP OF TEA THAT'S FINE IT JUST GETS OLD TO HEAR PEOPLE DISMISSING THEM AS GATEWAY OR FILLERS OR GROAN ABOUT HOW THEIR SIX FRIENDS DON'T WANT TO BREAK OFF INTO SMALLER GROUPS FOR HEAVY GAMES MOST PEOPLE LIKE TO SOCIALIZE A LITTLE AND VIEW IT AS PLEASANT INSTEAD OF A CHORE THAT GETS OTHER WARM BODIES TO THE TABLE
I'M WITH YOU THE LEGACY GAMES ARE POINTLESS TO ME AND I COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THEM ALTHOUGH I LIKE CARCASSONNE AND CATAN I ONLY KIND OF LIKE THEM AND WILL PLAY THEM WITH FOLKS WHO ARE NOT NORMALLY INTO BOARD GAMES AS THEY ARE DECENT GATEWAY STARTING GAMES I REALLY DISLIKE THE GAMES LIKE ONE NIGHT WEREWOLF AND CODENAMES REALLY I AM NOT THAT INTO MOST CO-OP GAMES AND ANYTHING RESEMBLING A PARTY GAME THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS TELESTRATIONS THAT GAME IS A HOOT WITH THE RIGHT GROUP OF PEOPLE AND ROUTINELY LEAVES ME SORE FROM LAUGHTER NOT A BIG FAN OF REALLY LONG GAMES EITHER SOME OF THE FOLKS AT MY AGS LOVE TWILIGHT IMPERIAL BUT THE IDEA OF PLAYING A GAME FOR HOURS IS INSANE I COULD GET OTHER GAME SESSIONS INTO THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME AND HAVE MUCH MORE FUN I PROBABLY SHOULD TRY IT AND MOST LIKELY WILL ONE DAY BUT SO FAR I HAVE BEEN AVOIDING IT
UNPOPULAR OPINION THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS MULTIPLAYER SOLITAIRE EVEN IF YOU'RE PLAYING A COMPLETELY SOLITAIRE GAME YAHTZEE OR REINER DECATHLON COME TO MIND GAMES THAT ARE EFFECTIVELY EACH PLAYER DOING THEIR OWN THING BY SIMPLY PLAYING IT TOGETHER WITH PEOPLE AND SETTING THE OBJECTIVE OF SCORING THE HIGHEST FASTEST WHATEVER TO WIN YOU HAVE CREATED INTERACTION LOW INTERACTION MAYBE BUT CLEARLY NOT NO INTERACTION COROLLARY DOMINION IS NO WAY MULTIPLAYER SOLITAIRE IT HAS MORE INTERACTION THAN YAHTZEE AND DECATHLON

AND I CAN ACTUALLY BACK IT UP WITH REASONING SUPPOSE THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE MOVES ONE IS LOW RISK LOW REWARD A GUARANTEED SCORE AND THE OTHER IS HIGH RISK HIGH REWARD A CHANCE TO GET A HIGH SCORE BUT PROBABLY SCORING LOW OTHERWISE EAST G IN YAHTZEE SCORE THAT PAIR OF SIXES OR TRY TO GO FOR THAT LARGE STRAIGHT IN DECATHLON KEEP YOUR CURRENT SCORE OR DO ANOTHER ATTEMPT WHERE YOU CAN SCORE HIGHER OR LOWER THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE AN OPPONENT MIGHT CAUSE YOU TO SELECT A DIFFERENT MOVE WHEN YOU'RE LEADING YOU'LL PROBABLY TRY TO KEEP THE LEAD AND DO THE FIRST OPTION WHILE WHEN YOU'RE TRAILING YOU'LL WANT TO GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE TO WIN AND TAKE THE SECOND OPTION

YES THIS BREAKS DOWN IF YOUR ONLY SOLE AIM IS TO SCORE A HIGH SCORE WHERE IN THAT CASE YOU'LL ALWAYS TAKE THE OPTION WITH HIGHEST POSSIBLE REWARD NO MATTER HOW SMALL THE CHANCE IF YOU ONLY PLAY FOR HIGH SCORE INSTEAD OF TO WIN AGAINST OPPONENTS YOU MIGHT AS WELL PLAY ALONE
WELL I MIGHT AS WELL THROW OUT MY OWN UNPOPULAR OPINIONS I GUESS THIS THREAD HAS EXPLODED TODAY

I DIDN'T ENJOY PANDEMIC LEGACY FOR ONE SPECIFIC REASON THAT IT ENCOURAGES YOU TO DESTROY OR DEFACE GAME COMPONENTS I JUST CAN'T PERSONALLY GET PAST THAT CONCEPT SO IT RUINS THE FUN I MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE
I DON'T SLEEVE ANYTHING EVEN HIDDEN ROLE GAMES I JUST CAN'T STAND THE FEEL OF SLEEVES ON CARDS THEY'RE EITHER TOO SLICK OR TOO TACKY AND ALL OF THEM FEEL AWFUL TO HANDLE SHUFFLE AND HAVE POKEY CORNERS
I'M TIRED OF ZOMBIES IF A GAME HAS ZOMBIES IN IT I'M GOING TO PASS ON IT THE CONCEPT IS SO TIRED AND OVERDONE I'M ALMOST TO THAT POINT WITH H PAGE HOVERCRAFT AND CTHULHU BUT NOT QUITE ZOMBIES ARE WORSE FOR ME
AFTER READING THIS THREAD IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE THINK HATING CATAN IS AN UNPOPULAR OPINION HOWEVER THE MAJOR CONSENSUS OF THIS SUBREDDIT IS THAT EVERYONE HATES CATAN

I THINK MY UNPOPULAR OPINION ON CATAN IS THAT IT IS A GREAT GATEWAY GAME PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS TO START THE HOBBY BUT EASY TO MOVE PASSED ONCE THEY REALIZE THERE'S MORE OUT THERE
I THINK BLOOD RAGE IS HIGHLY OVERRATED GASP IT'S VERY SWINGY THE PLAY IS GENERALLY UNINTERESTING AND ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU DO IN THE 1ST AND 2ND AGE ARE NEGATED BY THE HIGH SCORING 3RD AGE GREAT MINIATURES TO BE SURE BUT I AM DEFINITELY IN THE MINORITY IN NOT SEEING WHY THIS GAME IS SO POPULAR
DUNGEONQUEST IS FUN
COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS JUST HORRIBLE
SCYTHE BLOOD RAGE SPYFAULT ARE ALL VERY MEDIOCRE GAMES OK BUT NOT THAT MUCH FUN THESE ARE HORRIBLY OVERRATED
THEME MATTERS A LOT A GAME WOULDN'T EVEN BE ATTRACTIVE TO HOBBY GAMERS LIKE US THINK ABOUT IT HOW MANY GAMES DO YOU PLAY EVEN HIVE MANAGES TO SQUEEZE A THEME ON WHAT IS A PERFECT PURE MECHANIC GAME
THEME IS VASTLY OVERRATED ALSO MOST GAMERS DON'T USE THE TERM CORRECTLY OR AT LEAST SPECIFICALLY THEME IS HOW WELL THE GAME INTEGRATES THE TOPIC OF THE GAME AND IS EITHER STRONG OR WEAK JUST BECAUSE A GAME HAS A STRONG THEME DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOOD OR THAT IT'S A GOOD THING AND BECAUSE THE THEME IS WEAK DOESN'T MEAN IT'S BAD WHEN GAMERS TALK ABOUT THEME THEY TYPICALLY MEAN TOPIC I LIKE GAMES ABOUT BATMAN OR CHROME THIS GAME HAS SUCH BEAUTIFUL BITS FOR ME THEME FALLS BY THE WAYSIDE VERY QUICKLY I APPRECIATE A GAME BUT IF NO ONE SPENT TIME MAKING THE ACTUAL GAME EXPERIENCE SMOOTH AND FULFILLING I DON'T CARE

JUDGING FROM THIS SUB BOARDGAMERS ARE SOME OF THE LEAST INTERESTING GROUP OF PEOPLE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED OF THE TOPICS ARE TRASH CMC PSIG HOW CAN I PAY LESS MONEY ALSO THEY ARE THE CHEAPEST GROUP I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED FEW GO FARTHER TO SAVE LESS AND THEY ARE PRONE TO CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND THINK THE BOARDGAME INDUSTRY IS SOME GIANT CONGLOMERATE OUT TO SCREW ALL THE LITTLE GUYS ASMODEUS

MINIATURES RARELY ADD TO A GAME AND MOST OF THE TIME DETRACT THEY BECOME THE FOCUS OF THE EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN THE GAME ITSELF AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH VISUAL ABSTRACTION IS A VITAL BEAUTIFUL AND GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATED THING

DON'T MAKE LIGHTHEARTED JOKES ABOUT HOW LAME AND UNINTERESTING THE DICE TOWER IS PEOPLE LOVE THE DICE TOWER EVEN THOUGH TOP LISTS ARE THE CHEAPEST AND LAZIEST FORM OF CONTENTION
STATS LIKE SANITY OR CHARISMA DO NOTHING FOR ME

YOU DIE IF YOUR SANITY HITS
SO IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT TYPE OF HP
NO BECAUSE IT GOES DOWN AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND REPRESENTS SOMETHING DIFFERENT

UH-HUH SURE

I LOVE STORY AND THEME IN GAMES BUT THINGS LIKE PRESTIGE OR BETRAYAL TOKENS MEAN NOTHING TO ME I'M MORE OF A FAN OF YOUR SHIP IN GALAXY TRUCKER WINS BECAUSE IT HAS MORE GUNS
EUROS ARE ACTIVELY WORSE THAN BEING AT WORK THEY ARE MIND NUMBING BORING AND I DON'T EVEN GET PAID FOR IT I DON'T SEE WHY PEOPLE PLAY THEM BUT THEN AGAIN I DON'T SEE WHY PEOPLE MEMORIZE TRAIN SCHEDULES OR BUS ROUTES EITHER
I CAN'T STAND THE DICE TOWER GUYS ESPECIALLY ASEL I'VE TRIED AND I JUST CAN'T WATCH MORE THAN MINUTES OH AND THAT OTHER BIG BALD GUY IRRITATES ME TOO I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE SO POPULAR BUT TO EACH THEIR OWN WE ALL SEE THE WORLD THROUGH OUR OWN EYES I I LOVE RADIO AND RODNEY THOUGH
MOST THEME S IN BOARD GAMES ARE DRY AND UNINSPIRING JUST GIVE ME FUN MECHANICS
DOMINANT SPECIES ISN'T WORTH THE SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF YOUR LIFE THAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE FOR ONE PLAYTHROUGH IT'S A FINE GAME AND INTERESTING THE FIRST FEW TIMES BUT AFTER 2 OR THERE'S VERY LITTLE PAYOFF TURNS GET TOO SWINGY IN ONE GAME THAT IT'S NOT WORTH TRYING TO MAKE A LONG-TERM PLAN
OH THE INEVITABLE CONVERSATION


YOU LIKE BOARD GAMES HAVE YOU HEARD OF SETTLERS OF CATAN


UGH I HATE CATAN CARCASSONNE ISN'T MUCH BETTER


AS FOR MY UNPOPULAR OPINIONS I CONSIDER MYSELF A BOARD GAME AFICIONADO DESPITE THE FACT THAT I REALLY REALLY DON'T LIKE ANYTHING THAT'S TOO HARD TO FIGURE OUT TEACH TO OTHERS I LIKE AN EASY INTUITIVE AND FUN GAME SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THAT MORE COMPLICATED BETTER BUT I JUST CAN'T GET INTO ANYTHING TOO INTENSE
I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO PLAY FOR FUN THAN TO WIN IF YOU'RE GOING TO COMMIT TO MORE THAN AN HOUR OF A GAME YOU SHOULD BE ENJOYING THE EXPERIENCE NOT DESPERATELY TRYING TO WIN AND GETTING SOUR WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LOSING I WOULD RATHER HAVE FUN AND LOSE THAN HAVE A BAD GAME AND WIN IF YOU'RE PLAYING A PLAYER GAME AND EVERYONE IS OF SIMILAR SKILL LEVELS STATISTICALLY YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO LOSE SO YOU SHOULD ACCEPT THAT PLAY WELL AND BE FUN TO PLAY WITH
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE LIKES STAR REALMS SO MUCH I FEEL LIKE IT'S A VERY SHALLOW GAME COMPARED TO MOST OF THE OTHER DECK BUILDERS I'VE PLAYED
PLAYER ELIMINATION IS FINE AND ACTIVELY BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVES FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF GAMES

IF YOU SLEEVE YOUR CARDS OF A YOU'RE WEIRD MAAAYBE DOMINION IS AN EXCEPTION
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ALMOST EVERYONE IS SO PRECIOUS ABOUT THEIR COMPONENTS I USE RUBBER BANDS ON MY CARDS NO THEY'RE NOT RUINED I ALWAYS HAVE A DRINK AT THE TABLE IT'S FINE SERIOUSLY AND I ALWAYS ALWAYS SNAP MY CARDS IT'S FUN AND YOU KNOW WHAT MY GAMES STILL LOOK GREAT

IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME HOW MANY POSTERS SHRIEK ABOUT THE ABOVE BEHAVIOR AS IF IT'S THE HEIGHT OF THOUGHTLESS DISRESPECT GAME COMPONENTS ARE BUILT TO HANDLE PLAYING THEY'RE NOT DELICATE PORCELAIN SCULPTURES
CODENAMES IS NOT GREAT

PICTURES IS MUCH MORE FUN BUT I WAS OVER THE ORIGINAL AFTER ABOUT 2 PLAYS
EDIT SEEING THE DOWNVOTES COME IN I AM GUESSING MY OPINION ON THESE TYPES OF THREADS IS UNPOPULAR TOO WELL THEN BOYS AND GIRLS BY ALL MEANS LET LOOSE ON GAMES YOU HATE WITHOUT CLARIFYING YOUR POSITION A GREAT THREAD TO READ IT SHALL BE




WELL ISN'T THIS THREAD GOING TO BE A LITTLE RAY OF SUNSHINE CAN WE HAVE POSITIVE THREADS ON THIS SUB OR AT LEAST SOME CRITICISMS SUPPORTED BY SOME ACTUAL TEXT

THIS THREAD WILL DEVOLVE INTO

SCYTHE IS HITE

TERRA MYSTIC IS TERRIBLE

I FUKIEN HATE AGRICOLA


LITERAL QUOTES FROM THIS THREAD

THIS DOES NOTHING TO FURTHER DISCUSSION IT ONLY INVITES PEOPLE TO COME IN AND DUMP ON GAMES THAT MANY PEOPLE ENJOY
LARGE COLLECTIONS ARE DUMB NOBODY NEEDS MORE THAN GAMES
2 BOARD GAMERS ARE WAY TOO COMPETITIVE I LOVE HEAVY GAMES WITH STRATEGIC DECISIONS BUT MAN IT'S BETTER TO LAUGH DRINK AND LOOSE A GAME RATHER THAN BE AN INSUFFERABLE KNOW-IT-ALL WHO WINS ALL THE TIME
A BOARD GAME DOESN'T REALLY INTEREST ME UNLESS IT CAN SHOW SOME SERIOUS STRATEGIC DEPTH ADDITIONALLY I HAVE A LOWER OPINION OF GAMES THAT HAVE A RANDOMIZING FACTOR IN GAMEPLAY AS MUCH AS I LIKE TO ROLL DICE OR DRAW FROM A DECK OF RANDOMLY SHUFFLED CARDS IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME APPEAL AS GAMES WITH COMPLETE INFORMATION AWARENESS LIKE CHESS OR BAUK
RANDOMNESS AFTER YOU MAKE A CHOICE IS NOT OKAY TO ME I'M OKAY WITH GAMES WITH DICE THAT YOU ROLL THEN CHOOSE WHAT TO DO WITH THE RESULT BUT I HATE GAMES WHERE YOU CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING ROLL AND CROSS YOUR FINGERS I FIND IT LAZY GAME DESIGN AND I FIND PEOPLE WHO LIKE IT TO HAVE POOR TASTES

I THINK GAMES LIKE PANDEMIC ARE NOT EVEN GAMES I THINK THEY ARE ACTIVITIES MUCH LIKE A JIGSAW ACTIVITY IS A PUZZLE BUT NOT A GAME
I THINK EURO GAMES THAT HAVE LITTLE OR NO PLAYER INTERACTION ARE TRASH IF I'M SITTING AT A TABLE WITH OTHER PEOPLE I WOULD LIKE TO BE INTERACTING WITH THEM AND NOT PLAYING SOLITAIRE
I THINK RODNEY SMITH ASSASSINATED JFK
SLEEVING IS UNNECESSARY

I GET IT YOU SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON YOUR GAME AND YOU WANT TO KEEP IT PRISTINE I HAVE IN FAIRNESS ACTUALLY SLEEVED A COUPLE GAMES FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE WAS ONE BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF CARD HANDLING AND BECAUSE IT'S AN EXPENSIVE GAME THAT WON'T GET AN ABUNDANCE OF REPRINTS

GENERALLY THOUGH I AVOID SLEEVING CARDS BECAUSE A I DON'T LIKE HOW IT FEELS IN MY FINGERS OR DURING SHUFFLING B I DON'T LIKE HOW THEY LOOK THE GLARE AND C I DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR ENERGY TO SPEND SLEEVING

NOW TO BE FAIR I DON'T PLAY A LOT OF CARD GAMES MOST OF THE GAMES I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH ARE BOARD GAMES THAT MAY SOMETIMES HAVE SOME CARDS BUT THEY AREN'T HANDLED A LOT A FEW HAVE MORE CARDPLAYER BUT HONESTLY EVEN IF MY CARDS GET ENOUGH PLAY TO GET A LITTLE WORN I DON'T THINK I'LL MIND


WELL I CAN DEFINITELY TELL BASED ON MY MOST DOWNVOTED COMMENT HERE THAT SAYING 2 PLAYER GAMES AREN'T BOARD GAMES TO ME IS AN UNPOPULAR OPINION I STILL LOVE PLAYING 2 PLAYER GAMES BUT TO ME WHEN I THINK OF BOARD GAMES I'LL ALWAYS THINK OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER NOT ME DUKING IT OUT AGAINST MY FRIEND

I ALSO STRUGGLE WITH CALLING DECKBUILDERS BOARD GAMES TO FOR THAT MATTER UNLESS THEY HAVE AN ACTUAL BOARD GAME COMPONENT SO WHILE I LOVE LEGENDARY ENCOUNTER ALIEN IT'S NOT A BOARD GAME

THE DEFINITION IS JUST SO LOOSE THESE DAYS THAT PEOPLE ON HERE WOULD CALL BRIDGE A BOARD GAME THAT'S RIDICULOUS
MUNCHKIN
I DONT LIKE IT JUST NOT MY CUP OFF TEA
IT COULD ALSO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY PLAYGROUND
EUROS BY AND LARGE ARE INCREDIBLY BORING EXPERIENCES AND THE PEOPLE WHO PLAY THEM ALMOST ALWAYS COME ACROSS AS VERY ELITIST
I DISLIKE CARCASSONNE TICKET TO RIDE FIVE TRIBES COSMIC ENCOUNTERS AND BLOOD RAGE

ALSO PANDEMIC LEGACY SEASON WAS MPH IT WAS OK I GUESS I PROBABLY WON'T PLAY ANOTHER LEGACY AGAIN

I'M NOT SURE WHAT GAMES I ENJOY THAT OTHER PEOPLE TEND TO HATE THERE ARE SOME GAMES I ENJOY THAT MY WIFE DOESN'T THOUGH SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE THE GRIZZLED AND MAGE KNIGHT
I DON'T LIKE WONDERS DUEL AND KIND OF ENJOY THE 2 PLAYER FROM THE BASE GAME
MINE SEEMS TO BE THAT I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT STAND MYSTERIUM I AM QUITE THE BUTT OF JOKES WHEN THE GROUP TRIADS TO BRING IT TO A SESSION LOL
VITICULTURE AT LEAST THE 1ST EDITION IS SWINGY NONSENSE

EDIT ADDED BOLD
I HATE KEYFLOWER
A LOT OF SOCIALLY INEPT GAMERS TRY AND USE THE IMMEDIATE META FOR DATING BUT IT NEVER WORKS I KNOW ONE WOMAN WHO ONLY WANTS A B F WHO PLAYS BOARDGAMES LIKE THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS SHE BASICALLY JUMPS ANY GUY WHO IS LESS THAN A WHO JOINS THE GROUP DATES HIM FOR A MONTH CALLS IT OFF AS THEY HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON AND THE GUY NEVER COMES BACK

ALSO MOST GAMERS CAN'T EXPLAIN A GAME THEY'LL JUST PARROT OUT THE RULEBOOK
THEME DOESN'T MATTER

IT CAN BE USEFUL IF MECHANISMS HAVE THEMATIC BUT IT ISN'T NECESSARY I'D RATHER HAVE AN INTERESTING MECHANISM THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THEMATICALLY THAN HAVE MY MECHANISMS TWISTED TO FIT THE THEME JUST GIVE ME INTERESTING GAME PLAY THAT CHALLENGES ME MENTALLY

OH AND THERE ARE ONLY TWO ACCEPTABLE WAYS FOR DICE TO BE USED IN A GAME AS MARKERS THAT YOU SET TO THE APPROPRIATE FACE OR 2 AS RESOURCES THAT YOU DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AFTER THEY ARE ROLLED AS LONG AS EITHER ALL PLAYERS USE THE SAME POOL OF DICE DRAFTING AND OR ONE VALUE ISN'T STRICTLY BETTER THAN OTHERS
I SEEM TO BE ALONE IN DISLIKING TIN GOOSE
AGRICOLA IS BORING AND OVERRATED
CATAN SUCKS TICKET TO RIDE SUCKS COSMIC ENCOUNTER SUCKS CARCASSONNE SUCKS RACE FOR THE GALAXY IS OVERRATED BUT I'M WILLING TO GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT DOMINION IS AWESOME REBELLION IS AWESOME TOM ASEL IS AN IDIOT
TANTO CHORE DOMINION BUT I LOVE BOTH

MAGE KNIGHT SHOULD NOT BE DISMISSED FOR BEING TOO COMPLEX OR TOO FIDDLY

MINIS LOOK BETTER UNPAINTED OF THE TIME


WASN'T IMPRESSED WITH SMALLSWORD AND THE MORE TIMES I PLAYED IT THE WORSE MY IMPRESSION VERY MUCH THE SAME THING WITH A THROWN AROUND ON DIFFERENT THINGS HERE AND THERE YOU ARE DOING THE SAME THINGS AT THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF THE GAME WITH A DIFFERENT PICTURE AND A ON SOMETHING OR A BEND RULE

ALSO ROLL FOR THE GALAXY LEFT ME WONDERING WHAT THE FUSS IS ABOUT AND WHY PEOPLE LIKE IT SO MUCH I DON'T GET IT THAT GAME SITS ON MY SHELF AFTER 2 AND A HALF PLAYS AND HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED SINCE

MONSTERPOCALYPSE IS A GAME I LOVE BUT NEVER GOT TOO POPULAR ITS ALMOST A PERFECT GAME FOR ME DUDES ON A MAP NICE MINIATURES NOT TOO LONG GREAT THEME DICE CHUCKING AND TACTICAL
I'M WITH YOU ON CARCASSONNE THAT GAME IS SO BORING
I FOUND SHERRIFF OF NOTTINGHAM TO HAVE NO GAME TO IT AT ALL
BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL IS THE ONLY GAME I'VE EVER SOLD BECAUSE IT WAS SO TERRIBLE
I'M ALL FOR BEING INCLUSIVE BUT OFTEN I WANT TO PLAY MY COPY OF PUERTO RICO OR TZOLKIN WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT ACCOMMODATING THE NEW PEOPLE WHO WANT SOMETHING LIGHT
I SEEM TO BE ALONE IN THAT I DIDNT ENJOY TERRAFORMING MARS FELT LIKE SEVERAL HOURS OF US ALL LOOKING AT OUR CARDS AND MOVING PRODUCTION LEVELS UP AND DOWN I'M GENERALLY NOT A FAN OF GAMES WHERE ALL THE RULES ARE ON THE CARDS I'D RATHER HAVE AN ELEGANT SET OF RULES AND GENERIC PIECES AND NO WE DIDNT TRY THE DRAFTING VERSION CANT REMEMBER IF THIS WAS A VARIANT OR THE ADVANCED GAME
I SORT OF HATE EUROGAMES HOW MANY WAYS ARE THERE TO CONSTRUCT A INSERT BUILDING NAME HERE USING INSERT RESOURCE NAME HERE THEY'RE COLD CALCULATED AND MOSTLY PREDICTABLE
I THINK IGNACE IS AN OVER RATED DESIGNER THE RULEBOOK FOR ROBINSON CRUSOE WAS TERRIBLE STRONGHOLD FIRST AND SECOND EDITION WERE PRETTY MEDIOCRE RATTLE BATTLE AND GRAB THE LOOT AND THE WITCHER BOARD GAME WERE OUTRIGHT AWFUL IMPERIAL SETTLERS AND ROBINSON FEEL LIKE FLUKES
I THINK THUNDERSTONE ADVANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DECK BUILDER AS IS MARVEL LEGENDARY

IN GENERAL I LIKE NEARLY ALL GAMES THE WAY THEY WERE DESIGNED WITHOUT GAME CHANGING EXPANSIONS EXTRA CONTENT THAT FITS SEAMLESSLY INTO THE GAME EXTRA CARDS FOR AGRICOLA OR DECK BUILDERS EXTRA ALIEN RACES FOR COSMIC ENCOUNTER ARE FINE ADDING RULES WITH AN EXPANSION FEELS LIKE LISTENING TO A COVER BAND SOMEONE ELSE DID IT BETTER FIRST AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME ALONG AND MAKE IT BETTER DON'T THINK SO
HMM WELL FROM WHAT I'VE READ IN OTHER THREADS AND FORUMS I SUPPOSE THIS WILL BE UNPOPULAR BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE GAMES GIVE ME DICE TO CHUCK AND A DECK TO SHUFFLE AND I'M PUMPED I CAN'T STAND SEEING ALL THE GETTING OR THE GAME CAN BE RUINED BY A BAD DICE TOSS COMMENTS THAT'S PART OF THE GAME PEOPLE BRRR STILL I LOVE THE FEELING OF DICE IN MY HAND AND TO HEAR THEM ROLL ACROSS THE TABLE AND NEVER KNOWING QUITE WHICH CARD IS COMING UP NEXT IN THE DECK

DON'T GET ME WRONG I LOVE MY EUROS TOO BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT AS ENGAGING FOR ME WITHOUT THAT EXTRA GAMBLE

NOW PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO PLAY A GAME OF CANDYLAND
COST
PAPER MONEY IS GOOD

MULTIPLE PATHS TO VICTORY IS A NONSENSE CONCEPT
TERRA MYSTIC IS UUUUUUGGGLLLLYYYYY

E DUDE MOST EVERYBODY ON THIS SUB ACKNOWLEDGES CATAN IS A GOOD AS A GATEWAY BUT NOT GREAT OVERALL
FUKIEN HATE AGRICOLA
SCYTHE IS HITE

TERRA MYSTIC IS TERRIBLE




I ALWAYS HAVE GREAT FUN PLAYING MUNCHKIN AND MOST EXPERIENCED GAMERS DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL
THIS IS AN UNPOPULAR OPINION AT LEAST AMONG CASUALS

IS NOT HYGGELIGT
MAGE KNIGHT IS A FUN KILLER YOUR TURN IS A LOT OF FUN THAT IS KILLED BY THE INSANE AMOUNT OF DOWNTIME
KINGMAKING IS A NECESSARY EVIL

NOW MY LOGIC IN THIS IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU GET INTO GAMES WHERE YOU ARE THE UNDERDOG FOR MOST OF THE TIME AND KNOW YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING A DECENT END SCORE ARE SLIM YOU GET BEAT DOWN EVEN MORE BECAUSE IT BENEFITS THE OTHER PLAYER

THE ONLY REASONABLE WAY OF COMBATTING THIS IN MY MIND IS THREATENING THE ATTACKER WITH IF YOU DO THIS I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET SECOND PLACE FEW THINGS ARE MORE FRUSTRATING THAN BECOMING THE PUNCHING BAG IN BOARDGAMES AND THE THREAT OF KINGMAKING MAKES PEOPLE WANT TO CONSIDER OTHER LESS OPTIMAL PLAYS
WONDERS SUCKS IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE TO LOSE THE GAME BY THE TIME YOUR TURN COMES AROUND IN THE FIRST ROUND
I DON'T LIKE A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THIS HOBBY THEY DO NOT HELP IN BRINGING IN NEW PEOPLE
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING I LOVE THIS HOBBY AND EVERYTHING ABOUT BUT JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE A BAD STEREO TYPE OVERWEIGHT SEXIST SMELLY SOCIAL INEPT WALL HUGGERS I'VE JUST MOVED FROM LONDON I HAD AN AMAZING GROUP A GREAT BUNCH OF DOWN TO EARTH FRIENDS WHEN I PLAY I WANT TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS NOT JUST PLAY GAMES
IT ALL CHANGED WHEN I GOT HERE I FOUND A GROUP MIN WALK FROM MY HOUSE MEETS TWICE A WEEK AMAZING I WENT ONCE OUT OF PEOPLE NOT A SINGLE ONE COULD MAINTAIN EYE CONTACT HOLD A CONVERSATION OR NOT MAKE MY FIANCE NOT FEEL REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE FROM THE STARING SHE ONLY CAME BECAUSE WE'D JUST LITERALLY MOVED INTO OUR HOUSE AND WE KNEW NO ONE

IT'S OOOO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THIS HOBBY IS SO GOOD THERE'S NOTHING ELSE THAT CAN BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN THE SAME WAY THAT BOARDGAMES CAN

I'LL KEEP ON SEARCHING FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE I CAN CALL MY FRIENDS AND PLAY GAMES WITH IN THE MEANTIME I'LL KEEP ON PLAYING SOLO
IRONICALLY THE MOST UNVOTED OPINIONS IN THESE THREADS BY THEIR VERY DEFINITION ARE THE LEAST APPLICABLE RESPONSES
ERIC LANG MAKES WEAKLY DESIGNED TERRIBLE BOARD GAMES PERCENT OF THE TIME PEOPLE OVERLOOK THIS BECAUSE OF BLOOD RAGE
I HATE BOTH CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY AND MUNCHKIN NEITHER REALLY TURN OUT TO BE MUCH OF A GAME WITH CH THE HUMOR IS SO POOR THAT YOU CAN OFTEN PICK A CARD AT RANDOM AND HAVE THE SAME CHANCE AT WINNING WITH MUNCHKIN YOU CAN IGNORE OF THE GAME PUT EVERYONE AT LEVEL AND WATCH EVERYONE KILL EACH OTHER UNTIL SOMEONE GETS LUCKY

BOTH ARE POPULAR BUT I JUST CAN'T SUFFER THEM
DRINKS NOT EVEN WATER SHOULD BE ALLOWED ON THE SAME TABLE AS THE BOARD GAMES NOT EVEN WITH A SIPPY CUP MOST PEOPLE THINK I'M A BIT TOO CRAZY FOR HAVING THIS ATTITUDE BUT MAYBE THEY'D UNDERSTAND IF THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO PAY FOR THE GAMES THEMSELVES
APPLES TO APPLES IS FUNNIER THAN CH

WHEN EVERYTHING IS FUNNY NOTHING IS FUNNY
FUCK DOMINION
I HATE LOVE LETTER
GALAXY TRUCKER IS A GOD AWFUL GAME WITH LITERALLY NO DECISION MAKING
UH YOU MEAN EACH WOULD BE HARD RATHER THAN I IMAGINE THAT'D BUMP THE COST OF MANUFACTURE AND SHIPPING INCREASED WEIGHT DRAMATICALLY

ALTERNATIVELY I SUPPOSE YOU COULD HAVE ALL THE CASES IN ONE BOOK BUT THEN THAT WOULD BE INCONVENIENT AS YOU'D HAVE TO KEEP FINDING THE RIGHT CASE AND THERE WOULD BE A RISK OF READING THE CLUES FOR THE RIGHT LOCATION BUT WRONG CASE WHEN INVESTIGATING A LEAD I SUPPOSE THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM COULD BE MITIGATED SOMEWHAT BY ADDING A COUPLE OF RIBBON BOOKMARKS BUT I FEEL LIKE THE CURRENT SYSTEM WOULD STILL BE PREFERABLE
HOW DO YOU FIGURE IT'D COST THE SAME
WHAT ON EARTH MAKES YOU THINK THAT WOULD COST THE SAME
AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT YOU SHOULD ONLY GET THE BONUS ON THE ACTUAL ATTACK
YUP THE ON A MARCH IS ONLY IF THAT MARCH INITIATES A BATTLE

IN YOUR CASE YOU MARCHED IN AND RESOLVED YOUR MARCH ORDER REMOVING IT IF YOU ARE LATER ATTACKED IN THAT REGION YOU GET NO BONUS FROM THE MARCH THAT BROUGHT YOU THERE REGARDLESS OF WHEN IT WAS IN THE PAST JUST NOW OR TURNS AGO
TRY R BOARDGAMEEXCHANGE OR S GEEK MARKETPLACE
I ENJOY LORDS OF WATERDEEP 2 PLAYERS BUT I THINK A FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY ENJOY TERRA MYSTIC 2 PLAYERS EVEN THOUGH I THINK THE BOARD IS PERHAPS TOO OPEN WITH 2


LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS PROBABLY BETTER AT 2 BUT THEY ARE PRETTY DIFFERENT GAMES REALLY WHAT SORT OF GAME WERE YOU LOOKING FOR

LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME WHILE TERRA MYSTIC IS A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT NETWORK BUILDING GAME

ANY OTHER INFO YOU CAN PROVIDE ON YOUR GAME PREFERENCES
DEFINITELY LORDS OF WATERDEEP IF YOU'RE TALKING EXCLUSIVELY TWO PLAYER TERRA AREA CONTROL AND CULT BOARD MECHANISMS ARE NOWHERE NEAR AS EFFECTIVE AT THE 2 PLAYER COUNTS
I'D ACTUALLY RECOMMEND CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD OVER EITHER OF THEM CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD IS VERY SIMILAR TO LORDS WITH IN MY OPINION MORE THINGS TO DO IT PLAYS PRETTY WELL WITH AND EVEN BETTER WITH OR
LORDS OF WATERDEEP IN MY EXPERIENCE TERRA MYSTIC IS JUST BRILLIANT WITH MORE PLAYERS
AS SOMEONE WHO ABSOLUTELY ADORES TERRA MYSTIC I CAN HONESTLY NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR 2 PLAYERS IT'S NOT BAD BUT IT'S JUST NOT NEARLY AS GOOD WITH PLAYERS

LORDS OF WATERDEEP HOWEVER EXCELS AS A 2 PLAYER GAME WITH THE EXPANSION IN MY OPINION ONLY PLAY WITH THE EXPANSION SURE SOME CARDS ARE NOT AS WELL BALANCED BIT AS A WHOLE IT'S A VERY FUN EXPERIENCE AND I CAN'T RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH
TERRA MYSTIC IS NOT GOOD 2 PLAYERS
AT 2 PLAYERS DUNGEON PETS USES A DUMMY PLAYER BUT HONESTLY IT'S NOT THE BAD ALL YOU ARE DOING IS MOVING MEEDLESS GOBLINS CLOCKWISE ON DIFFERENT TRACKS AFTER EACH ROUND

MECHANICALLY ITS AROUND THE SAME WEIGHT AS ALCHEMIST AND ARCHIPELAGO BUT IN PRACTICE IT FEELS QUITE AS YOU TRY TO OPTIMIZE YOUR SCORE FOR THE THERE ARE A LOT OF INTERESTING DECISIONS TO MAKE AND THE GAME FEELS QUITE PUZZLE AS YOU TRY TO MAXIMIZE THINGS WITHOUT KILLING YOUR PETS FURTHERMORE MANY OF THOSE DECISIONS CENTER AROUND OBTAINING AN EASIER PAYOUT OR TAKING RISKS FOR A HIGHER PAYOUT BUT DON'T THINK IT IS PUSH YOUR LUCK THE RISK COMES WITH TRYING TO PLAN MULTIPLE ROUNDS AHEAD AND ACCOUNT FOR EVERYTHING TO PROPERLY RAISE FEED ETC YOUR PETS

I LIKE IT QUITE A BIT I THINK MANY GAMERS THINK DUNGEON LORDS IS A STRONGER TITLE BUT I FIND DUNGEON PETS TO BE LESS OBTUSE

IF I HAD TO COMPLAIN TWO ISSUES WITH THE GAME FIRST THE COMPONENTS ARE AVERAGE AND THE CARDS ARE A SIZE WHICH IS ONE OF MY PET PEEVES YOU CAN NOW GET SLEEVES FOR THE GAME BUT THAT WASN'T TRUE WHEN THE GAME FIRST CAME OUT SECONDLY THE GAME HAS BLIND BIDDING YOU SEPARATE WORKERS INTO GROUPS AND THE LARGEST GROUP GO FIRST THIS DOES CREATE FOR SOME TENSION BUT I'M NOT A FAN OF BLIND BIDDING ESPECIALLY IN HEAVIER EUROS THAT BEING SAID IT'S NOT THAT INFLUENTIAL
I LOVE ALCHEMISTS AND DUNGEON PETZ SO I THINK YOU'LL LOVE DUNGEON PETZ AS WELL

COMPARED TO ALCHEMISTS DUNGEON PETZ SHARES THE SAME WORKER PLACEMENT MECHANIC BUT IS CONSIDERED LIGHTER BECAUSE DP HAS NO DEDUCTION PART DP ALSO ENCOURAGES YOU TO PLAN FOR FEW ROUNDS AHEAD TO COMPETE IN CONTEST AND SELL PETZ TO BUYERS DP IS A LITTLE BIT MORE RANDOM THAN ALCHEMISTS IN MY OPINION BECAUSE YOU NEED TO DRAW AND FULFILL THE PETS NEEDS WHICH CAN VARY AND MIGHT CAUGHT YOU UNGUARDED DP SHARES THE SIMILAR TASTE OF HUMOUR WITH ALCHEMISTS
WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS A STRESSFUL FRUSTRATING GAME I LOVE DUNGEON PETZ BUT IT CAN BE A TIGHT WORKER PLACEMENT GAME WHEN PLAYING WITH PEOPLE MORE AKIN TO AGRICOLA THEN VITICULTURE
I'VE PLAYED THEM ALL I STILL OWN ARCHIPELAGO AND VITICULTURE AND I SUSPECT IF YOU'RE A FAN OF ALL THREE OF THOSE GAMES YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE DUNGEON PETZ IT'S QUITE A BIG GAME MAYBE ON PAR WITH ARCHIPELAGO FOR COMPLEXITY AND IT HAS A LOT OF COOL VARIATION I'D SAY GO FOR IT EVEN WITH WHICH USES A BLOCKING PLAYER THAT MOVES AROUND THE BOARD TO REDUCE YOUR CHOICES EASY TO MANAGE
SUBSCRIBING SINCE I FIND MYSELF IN THE SAME POSITION

COROLLARY IS DUNGEON PETZ IN ANY CAPACITY BECAUSE I'M A SAD LONELYBOI
I WOULD SAY YES
PROBABLY

IT'S GREAT I LIKE ALCHEMIST AND OWN BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED THE OTHER TWO
YEAH DUDE DUNGEON PETZ IS A SOLID GAME YOU ARE PLAYING PROBABILITIES LIKE WHOA WHEN ASSIGNING NEEDS TO YOUR PETZ AND THAT CAN BE STRESSFUL BUT THE STORIES YOU CAN TELL ARE QUITE ENTERTAINING GHOSTY TRIED TO BURST MAGICALLY OUT OF HIS CAGE AND TOOK A MASSIVE DUMP WHILE STRAINING ETC

IT'S UP TO YOU THOUGH WE CANNOT GAUGE WHAT YOU FIND STRESSFUL OR FRUSTRATING EUROS OFTENTIMES CAN DEFINE FRUSTRATING AS YOU GENERALLY CAN'T DO EVERYTHING YOU NEED WANT TO IN THE PERIOD OF GAME TIME AND DP IS DEFINITELY NO EXCEPTION
WHAT I KNOW OF VITICULTURE I'D LIKE TO THINK DUNGEON PETZ IS SLIGHTLY LIGHTER SO I BET YOU'D BE FINE AT FIRST GLANCE IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE I'VE TAUGHT SOME VERY INEXPERIENCED PEOPLE HOW TO PLAY AND THAT'S GONE OVER WELL THE ICONOGRAPHY IS VERY CLEAR AS LONG AS YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE PERSON TAKING CARE OF THE VERY MINIMAL BOOKKEEPING BITS AND NOTIFYING OTHERS WHAT TO EXPECT FOR THE NEXT ROUND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO

I LOVE DUNGEON PETZ JUST MAKE SURE TO SCOOP THAT POOP
I HAVE THE WOODEN VERSION I'D SAY IT'S NOT WORTH IT IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE AND DEXTERITY GAMES RARELY HITS THE TABLE AT LEAST NOT FOR ME I WAS PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT BUT IT WILL WORE OF AND NOW I NEVER PLAY IT

AT LEAST THE BOX IS PRETTY
THE PLASTIC VERSION IS DEFINITELY GOOD THE TWO VERSIONS PLAY MARGINALLY DIFFERENT DUE TO THE MATERIALS BUT NEITHER IS A WORSE EXPERIENCE THAN THE OTHER
I HAVE THE PLASTIC VERSION BUT I WISH THAT I HAD BOUGHT THE WOOD VERSION THE MAIN REASON BEING THE WOOD VERSION ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY ALL THE EXPANSIONS SINCE THEY ARE IN WOOD AS WELL

THAT BEING SAID I'M NOT HUGE ON BUYING EXPANSIONS IN GENERAL FOR ANY GAME NOT JUST FLICK EM UP SO IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL THE PLASTIC VERSION IS ACTUALLY SURPRISINGLY NICE THE PLASTIC IS NICE AND ROUNDED NO SHARP EDGES OR FLASHING THE PUCKS HAVE A SOLID WEIGHT TO THEM THE INSERT IS VACUUM FORMED AND FITS ALL THE PIECES IN PERFECTLY ALL IN ALL I'M SATISFIED WITH THE PLASTIC VERSION I THINK FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG

JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT THE WOOD PIECES WILL HAVE A BIT MORE TEXTURE WEIGHT TO THEM AND THE WOOD VERSION WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH EXPANSIONS
CAN'T COMPARE DIRECTLY BUT THE PLASTIC VERSION IS GREAT IF ANYTHING I THINK IT'S LESS FRAGILE THAN WOOD I'VE SEEN MY FAIR SHARE OF BROKEN MEEDLESS THE PLASTIC PIECES DON'T SEEM TO DECREASE PLAYABILITY FROM WHAT I CAN TELL I'D SAVE THE MONEY AND BUY A WHOLE OTHER GAME WITH IT WELL THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID DO
I HAVE THE PLASTIC VERSION AND CAN VOUCH FOR THE QUALITY IT'S REALLY NICE THE FLICKING PIECES HAVE A WEIGHT IN THEM TO MAKE THEM MORE SATISFYING TO USE

AND I PREFER THE SMALLER BOX AND PRICE
INDEED AND THE TWO BOXES FROM EACH SEASON FORM A LARGER PANORAMA WHEN PLACED SIDE BY SIDE IF THERE'S A SEASON PERHAPS THE BOXES WILL COMPLETE THE CENTER ROW OF THE WATCH FACE
I'LL ADMIT I HAVEN'T PAID A TON OF ATTENTION BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THE EXPANSION IS NOT OUT YET

PREDATOR IS GOOD THOUGH
PREDATOR IS REALLY GOOD AS A STAND ALONE GAME BUT IT'S NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ALIENS AT LEAST IT'S NO MORE COMPATIBLE THAN MARVEL LEGENDARY OR ANY OF THE OTHER YOU CAN COMBINE THEM BUT IT'S CLUNKY AND LIMITED

THE ALIENS EXPANSION THOUGH LOOKS REALLY REALLY GOOD HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TRY IT BUT I AM EXCITED
APPLES AND ORANGES THERE IS NO WAY TO REALLY ANSWER THIS THE GAMES ARE VERY DIFFERENT WHAT IS IT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT CATAN WHAT DO YOU LIKE IN GAMES
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY IS A MUCH MORE COMPLEX GAME THAN THE BASE GAME OF CATAN
TOUGH TO SAY AS THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT GAMES ANY OTHER GAMES YOU LIKE OR DISLIKE
PROBABLY PRETTY GOOD
WE NEED MORE INFORMATION TO HELP YOU
HARD TO COMPARE BUT I DON'T REALLY EVER WANT TO PLAY CATAN I LOVE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THOUGH THE CARD GAME VERSION IS REALLY GOOD TOO
THE GAMES ARE NOTHING ALIKE AS FAR AS GAMEPLAY GOES ONE GAME IS A KIND OF TRADE NEGOTIATION THING THE OTHER IS A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME
R HEXANDCOUNTER

EVEN LIKE MEMOIR THOUGH
THE COIN GAMES AREN'T QUITE PROPER WARGAMES BUT THEY'RE A GREAT INTRO AND JUST FANTASTIC GAMES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT FALLING SKY IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE
SLASK IS REALLY GOOD AND A LOT LIGHTER THAN ASW COMBAT COMMANDER EUROPE IS A FAVORITE WHEN WE CAN GET TIME TO GET IT ON THE TABLE
CURRENT GAMES I LOVE THAT ARE TOTALLY WAR GAMES OR COULD BE LUMPED INTO WARGAMES CATEGORY

ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER BEEN PLAYING THE SS

HERE I STAND

COMBAT COMMANDER EUROPE

FRIEDRICH AND MARIA

GUNS OF GETTYSBURG
IF YOU LIKE OLDER HISTORY THE BOH SYSTEM BY GMT HAS ALL YOUR ANCIENT WARS COVERED FROM CHARIOTS IN MESOPOTAMIA ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SENGOKU PERIOD IN JAPAN
I'M A BIG FAN OF FIRE IN THE LAKE AND CONFLICT OF HEROES
CHECK OUT THE HAMATA TOP LIST SERIES

THEY HAVE POPULISTS ON BEST ENTRY GAME BEST WW2 PACIFIC GAME AND MANY MORE

EDIT MORE VIDEOS UNDER A NEW CHANNEL
PATHS OF GLORY IT'S A GREAT GAME

HERE I STAND AND VIRGIN QUEEN ARE GREAT OPTIONS

ALSO COIN GAMES ARE PRETTY GOOD AND LIGHT ENOUGH COMPARED TO ABOVE TO APPEAL TO A BROADER AUDIENCE MOST NOTABLY FIRE IN THE LAKE

IF YOU WANT ONES I'VE NEVER PLAYED ANY OF THOSE YET
I REALLY ENJOY CONFLICT OF HEROES WITH THE SOLO EXPANSION
HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT HEROES OF NORMANDIE BY AELLO HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET THOUGH
COMBAT COMMANDER TRIUMPH AND TRAGEDY BMT THE NEXT WAR SERIES NO RETREAT OPERATION DAUNTLESS
SMALLSWORD ISN'T REALLY A GREAT TWO PLAYER GAME IN MY OPINION IF YOU'LL PLAY WITH MORE PEOPLE YOU'LL NOTICE IT SOLVES A BUNCH OF YOUR CONCERNS THERE'LL BE MORE INTERACTION BETWEEN PLAYERS AND YOU'LL BALANCE THE OVER POWERED RACE POWER COMBOS WITH GANGING UP ON THE LEADER WITH TWO PLAYERS IT IS WAY TOO SWINGY FOR MY TASTE IT'S STILL ALWAYS GOING TO BE A GATEWAY LEVEL GAME BUT IT IS A FUN GATEWAY GAME JUST NOT WITH TWO PLAYERS
SMALL WORLD IS DEFINITELY AN GAME NOT SURE WHAT YOU USUALLY PLAY BUT PERHAPS YOU'VE MOVED BEYOND THIS ALREADY

THERE IS AN EXPANSION CALLED TALES LEGENDS WHICH GREATLY IMPROVES THE GAME IN MY OPINION ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE IT CAN BE HARD TO FIND IT ADDS EVENT CARDS THAT CHANGE UP HOW EACH ROUND OF THE GAME IS PLAYED YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE THE UPCOMING EVENT FOR THE NEXT ROUND SO YOU CAN PLAN AHEAD THIS MAKES THE GAME FAR MORE STRATEGIC THAT IS THE ONLY WAY I'LL PLAY SMALL WORLD ANYMORE BUT EVEN THEN I'D MUCH RATHER PLAY SOMETHING ELSE
I HAVE ALWAYS FELT SMALLWOOD TO BE A GATEWAY GAME THAT IS IT INTRODUCES FANS OF RISK TO THE OTHER POSSIBILITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE IT'S MENT TO BE SIMPLE AND ENGAGING

IN TERMS OF OVERALL STRATEGY IT'S NOT THE DEEPEST AND SHOULDN'T BE TAKEN AS SUCH I STILL LIKE PLAYING THOUGH WITH A COLD BEER AND TALKING WITH THE WIFE WHILE PLAYING THE BEST EXPANSIONS ARE THE ONES THAT ADD MORE ARMIES AND POWERS ADDING MORE VARIABILITY TO THE GAME AND IF YOU END UP ENJOYING THE GAME I WOULD LOOK INTO THOSE ONES AND IGNORE THE ONES THAT ADD A NEW BOARD FOR NOW

NOW IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STEP UP FOR 2 PLAYER STRATEGY GAMES I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND EMET AS A STRATEGIC AREA CONTROL GAME THAT PLAYS BY CHANGING THE SIZE OF THE BOARD WITH THE PLAYER COUNT IF YOU REALLY LOVE LORD OF THE RINGS THEN TAKE A LOOK AT WAR OF THE RING AS THE MOST THEMATIC STRATEGY GAME AVAILABLE


YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
SMALLSWORD IS OVER RATED AND VERY CAMEY YOU ARE DOING THE SAME THING THE ENTIRE GAME WITH AN OCCASIONAL PICTURE CHANGE AND A OR RULE BEND HERE AND THERE
ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER
REPUBLIC OF ROME
ANAGRAMS

WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THIS MIGHT GO OVER BETTER IF YOU SAY LOOKING FOR SOME LIGHT GAMES THERE'S TONS OF LISTS WITH EXCELLENT LIGHT GAMES IF YOU ROOT AROUND JUST BECAUSE IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND OR SORORITY GIRLS WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'LL LIKE CASE IN POINT I USED TO READ THE BG LISTS ABOUT GIRLFRIEND GAMES BUT MY EX HATED THOSE GAMES BUT LOVED EL GRANDE AND HEROSCAPE MY CURRENT GIRLFRIEND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I PLAYED GAMES A LOT UNTIL ABOUT A YEAR INTO DATING I MOSTLY PLAYED ON MY PHONE THEN NEW CITY FEW GAME FRIENDS AND SHE HAD ABOUT ZERO EXPERIENCE WITH BOARD GAMES SINCE YOUTH BUT WAS INTERESTED IN TRYING SOMETHING FAST FORWARD A A BIT AND SHE'S BEEN WANTING TO PLAY MEMOIR EVERY NIGHT AND SWITCH SIDES AFTER EACH BATTLE I HAVE HAD TONS OF FRIENDS WITH SIMILAR EXPERIENCES

THROW THEM A CURVE BUT KEEP THE LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY MATCHING THE SITUATION YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT GAME SOMEONE WILL LOVE UNTIL THEY PLAY IT
MARRYING MR DARCY IS REALLY FUN

BILLIONAIRE BANSHEE IS A GREAT LIGHT DISCUSSION GAME

ALSO CODENAMES AND CARCASSONNE


IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY LIKE REALLY IF THEY WANT LAUGH OUT LOUD THEY SHOULD GO FOR PARTY GAMES LIKE TELESTRATION

LIKE PRETTY ART DIXIT HOKKAIDO

LIKE BOOKS AND READING MAYBE TRY BRING YOUR OWN BOOK

LOVE SOME COMBAT SMALL WORLD

IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT THEY'LL BE LOOKING FOR WHEN OUTSIDE OF HOME I LOVE HOKKAIDO AND BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL BUT I WON'T PLAY EITHER OUTSIDE BECAUSE I LIKE THERE TO BE SOME SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT OLD JAPANESE AND HAUNTING MUSIC RESPECTIVELY
BEYOND BAKER STREET OR HANAFI MIGHT WORK AS IT KEEPS THEM ALL TALKING I'D PICK BBS FIRST BUT DON'T KNOW THE AVAILABILITY

HOKKAIDO I'LL SECOND PRETTY CHILL

RED FOR SOMETHING EXTRA LIGHT BUT INTERACTIVE ENOUGH AND KEEPS YOU FOCUSED

LOVE LETTER BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO TALK AROUND OR ABOUT THE GAME
ONE OF MY FAVORITE FOUR PLAYER GAMES IS RED DRAGON INN I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO COMPLICATED NO MORE THAN CATALAN AND THEY GET TO DRINK AND BEAT EACH OTHER UP
EXPLODING KITTENS AND BOSS MONSTERS MAYBE MUNCHKIN THEY'RE ALL THREE PRETTY SIMPLE BUT GET REALLY CHEEKY
I JUST PLAYED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME ON FRIDAY WITH A GAMING BUDDY MY SON AND MY SON'S FRIEND

THE GAME WAS A HIT WITH THE PLUS DUDES AND THE YO DUDES LOVED THE DRAFTING PROGRAMMING AND THE CHAOS BEAUTIFUL GAME THAT WAS FUN FUNNY AND PRETTY LIGHT EASY TO PLAY AND LOVE
I FINISHED MISSION JUST YESTERDAY AND ALL OF MY SESSIONS WERE FULL OF EXCITEMENT AND FUN THE MISSIONS OBJECTIVES AND SETTINGS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER MAKING EACH MISSION FEEL UNIQUE AND WE NEED TO DEVELOP DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AS WELL

FOR REPLAY VALUE I'D BE HAPPY TO PLAY ALL MISSIONS AGAIN AS ANOTHER CAMPAIGN OR ONLY PLAYING ONE MISSION INDEPENDENTLY THERE ARE VARIANTS AS WELL IN BG FORUM WHICH I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THEM NEXT WEEK END
PLAYED IT FOR THE SECOND TIME LAST NIGHT I WAS SURPRISED HOW MUCH FUN GETTING DAMAGED WAS I WAS COOPING LEFT ROTATING RANDOMLY ETC IT'S PRETTY HILARIOUS THAT YOU INSTAGIB BADDIES WHEN YOU RUN OVER THEM

I LIKE THE GAME FOR A LOT OF REASONS SUCH AS THE HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTION OF THE PIECES THE BOARD AND OF THE TRAYS I JUST FEEL THAT ULTIMATELY THE GAME LACKS DEPTH IN VARIETY IN THE LEVELS I'VE ALREADY TRIED LEVEL VERSIONS OF MANY OF THE CARDS PLUS WE GOT OUR OVERDRIVES I JUST FEEL THAT IT'S GOING TO FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE SAME AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN IT WOULD BE COOL TO HAVE DIFFERENT CARDS IN THE DECK BASED ON THE SCENARIO YOU PLAY THE BLANDNESS OF THE ENEMY ALSO IS AN ISSUE THEY JUST SPAWN AND MOVE A SPACE YOU ANNIHILATE OF THEM REGULARLY WITH GREAT EASE I WISH THERE WAS MORE TO THEM SUCH AS SOME OF THEM BEING RESISTANT TO FIRE EXTRA VULNERABLE TO LIGHTNING ETC

IT'S A COOL GAME BUT I QUESTION ITS STAYING POWER IT'S A GREAT GAME TO GET PEOPLE INTO BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO PLAYING HEAVIER GAMES MAY WANT TO PLAY A FEW LEVELS TO SEE IF IT'LL KEEP THEIR INTEREST
I HAVE HAD 2 SESSIONS OF THIS PLAYED TUTORIAL AND THE FIRST 2 MISSIONS IT'S FUN FOR SURE BUT I REALLY LIKE REPROGRAMING GAMES SO MAYBE I'M BIASED I DON'T CARE FOR CHROME BUT I APPRECIATE IT AND BOY DOES THIS GAME PACK IN A LOT

I LOVE THE FEELING OF COMPLETE DESPAIR AT THE START OF THE GAME WHEN YOU HEAR THE MOVEMENT AND MINION SPAWN RULES THINKING THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL YOU'LL DO THIS MISSION W MACHS NO LESS AND AFTER A FEW YOU START NOTICING YOUR MACHS PACK QUITE A PUNCH AND EVENTUALLY IT STARTS TO BECOME CLEAR THAT THE MISSION IS INDEED WINNABLE IT REMINDS ME OF SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE AFTER THE 1ST ROUND WHERE THE SET UP AND INITIAL VILLAIN TURN ARE COMPLETELY BRUTAL BUT THE SUBTLE GRIND SLOWLY TURNS THE TIDE YEAH I MIGHT BE SELLING IT ONCE THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER BUT I CAN EASILY SEE THEM MAKING ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS THOUGH WHO KNOWS IF THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH THIS SIDE PROJECT AS IT'S PROBABLY NOT A MAJORITY PRIORITY OR A HUGE MONEY MAKER
JUST WAIT TILL YOU GET TO MISSION
FOR THE BIT ABOUT DAMAGED MACHS BEING USELESS JUST REPAIR OR DON'T TAKE DAMAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU WILL NEED TO START PLANNING A COUPLE TURNS IN ADVANCE IN THE FUTURE AND PLANNING WHAT YOU MAY NEED OR COULD USE ON SUBSEQUENT DRAFTS
ARE THERE ANY TOUGH DECISIONS TO BE MADE IN THE GAME OR ARE THE CHOICES USUALLY QUITE OBVIOUS
I PICKED IT UP EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T IT REALLY LOOKED LIKE THE GAME FOR ME EVERYONE WAS RAVING ABOUT IT AND I KEPT HEARING THAT IT WASN'T AN AMERITRASH GAME

WELL I GOT IT AND IT'S AN AMERITRASH GAME THAT WASN'T FOR ME I PLAYED A FEW GAMES AND I JUST DIDN'T GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT SOLD IT LAST WEEK

I'M GLAD YOU'RE ENJOYING IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE BUT ME DOES HAHA
CLOCKWORK WARS WOULD BE A GREAT NEXT STEP ONLY A FEW MINIS BUT I PREFER THIS TO EMET AT ANY PLAYER COUNT
YOU COULD DO STAR WARS MINIATURES IT'S CHEAP AND IS EXCLUSIVELY 2 PLAYER

I REALLY LOVE EL GRANDE AS A DUDES ON A MAP GAME BUT IT DITCHES MINIATURES FOR JUST CUBES ITS NOT THE MOST AMAZING THING AT TWO PLAYERS THOUGH
I OWN EMET BUT NOT THE EXPANSION BUT FOR ALL I'VE HEARD AND RESEARCHED ABOUT IT IT'S REALLY GOOD IF YOU LIKE THE GAME ADDS A WHOLE NEW COLOR THAT MAKES STRATEGY DEEPER AND USES EVEN MORE TABLE SPACE
MAYBE CYCLADES WITH THE TITAN EXPANSION
THE EXTENDED GAMEPLAY IS SORT OF HILARIOUS HE MISSES THE INFECT STEP SEVERAL TIMES IN A ROW FORGETS TO DRAW CARDS FORGETS TO DISCARD CARDS IT'S A MESS

STILL GIVES A GOOD IMPRESSION OF HOW IT PLAYS THOUGH
SORRY RADIO I'VE STOPPED WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS THAT INFECTIOUS ENTHUSIASM IS BAD FOR MY BANK ACCOUNT IT'S BEST IF I JUST DON'T WATCH
I DON'T THINK I NEED ANOTHER PANDEMIC GAME UNLESS IT'S LEGACY SEASON 2 THIS SOUNDS NEAT AND I LIKE THE THEME BUT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING CALLING TO ME TO GET IT
I PLAYED THIS WITH MY GROUP YESTERDAY IT FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE REGULAR PANDEMIC THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES ARE

YOU CAN'T ERADICATE DISEASES THIS MEANS YOU HAVE TO KEEP ON TOP OF ALL THE COLOURS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE GAME

YOUR MOBILITY IS MUCH LESS THAN WHAT YOU MIGHT BE USED TO NO AEROPLANES YOU CAN TAKE A SHIP FROM ONE PORT TOWN TO ANOTHER PORT TOWN IF YOU HAVE THE CAD TO SPEND AND IF THE PORT TOWN IS ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE YOU WANT TO GO WE DIDN'T USE THAT FEATURE THE WHOLE GAME

YOU CAN INSTEAD BUILD RAILWAY TRACKS WHICH REALLY REALLY HELP GET THOSE BAD BOYS DOWN EARLY

THE SPACE BETWEEN CITIES IS NOW A THING CALLED A REGION YOU CAN APPLY ABILITIES TO A REGION THAT AFFECT ALL CITIES TOUCHING IT EAST G WATER PURIFICATION ONE WATER TOKEN WILL PREVENT ONE DISEASE CUBE BEING PLACED THOSE WERE INCREDIBLY USEFUL THE NURSE ALSO HAS A COOL REGION ABILITY

LOADS AN LOADS OF SPECIAL EVENTS CARDS

SPECIAL DISEASE CARDS THAT ADD AN EXTRA ELEMENT TO ONE DISEASE TO MAKE THE GAME A BIT TOUGHER

I FOUND IT QUITE ENJOYABLE AND A NICE TWIST PLUS THERE WAS SOME NICE FLAVOUR TEXT ON SOME OF THE CARDS WITH INTERESTING HISTORICAL FACTS I'M NOT SURE IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE BOTH REGULAR PANDEMIC AND IBERIA AS THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR BUT IF YOU ARE A BIG PANDEMIC FAN LIKE I AM THEN IT DOES ADD SOME VARIETY TO A GAME THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PLAYED HUNDREDS OF TIMES
I'M INTERESTED IN HIS THOUGHTS BUT I CAN'T WATCH ANY OF HIS VIDEOS BECAUSE THEY GIVE ME SEVERE ANXIETY ANY SUMMARIES PLEASE
OOH AND IT'S FINALLY BACK IN STOCK AT MM SO VERY TEMPTING
WAS VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THIS ONE GOING IN AS THE IT'S A ONE-TIME PRINTING LIMITED EDITION FACTOR HAS BEEN DANGLED OUT THERE BY THE PUBLISHER READING UP ON IT THOUGH IT'S A COPY PRINT RUN NO NEED TO MAKE A BLIND ORDER HERE IF I EVER PLAY IT AND LIKE IT THEN I CAN WORRY ABOUT PICKING IT UP
FOR SOMEONE THAT HAS NOT OWNED A COPY OF PANDEMIC WOULD YOU GUYS RECOMMEND TO GET REGULAR PANDEMIC OR IBERIA

TO CLARIFY I SEE CULLING AS A METHOD OF REMOVING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF GAMES FOR A HOST OF REASONS TO GET TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OR TO REMOVE UNPLAYED INFREQUENTLY PLAYED GAMES WHILE I SEE DISTILLING AS THE INTENTIONAL REMOVAL OF AS MANY GAMES FROM ONE'S COLLECTION AS POSSIBLE WHILE STILL REMAINING A FUN VERSATILE AND REPAYABLE COLLECTION

I FAIL TO SEE THE DISTINCTION YOU'RE MAKING HERE IF IT'S ARBITRARY JUST SAY SO YOU PREFER THE TERM DISTILLING TO CULLING BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE ANY DIFFERENCE IN REMOVING A GAME FOR ONE REASON VERSUS REMOVING A GAME FOR ANOTHER IT'S STILL REMOVING A GAME FROM YOUR COLLECTION EITHER WAY THE END RESULT IS THE SAME I'M PRETTY SURE ANYONE WHO GETS RID OF A GAME STILL WANTS WHAT THEY HAVE LEFT TO BE FUN VERSATILE AND REPAYABLE

TAKES OFF PEDANTIC HAT

I'M IN A CONSTANT STATE OF CULLING DISTILLING REDUCING I DON'T LIKE HAVING LOTS OF MPH GAMES OR GAMES THAT DO THE SAME THING ONLY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY I LIKE TO HAVE ONE MAAAAAAYBE TWO EXCELLENT FANTASTICALLY FUN EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENT MECHANICS OR PLAYER COUNTS

CURRENTLY I COULD PROBABLY REMOVE

SAN JUAN I ALSO OWN RACE FOR THE GALAXY AND ENJOY IT MORE
PUERTO RICO SCRATCHES THE SAME ITCH AS FTG BUT QUICKER
MARVEL LEGENDARY UNINSPIRED DECKBUILDER THAT THE SO LOVES SO I'LL NEVER GET RID OF IT I PREFER TRAINS


GAMES THAT WOULD STAY

HANSA TEUTONIA I JUST DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S CLOSE TO IT
CONCORDIA PROBABLY MY FAVORITE TRADING GAME FOR MORE THAN 2 PLAYERS
CARCASSONNE STILL A GREAT GAME AND NO OTHERS I HAVE ARE NEAR AS QUICK OR ELEGANT
HIVE NO OTHER ABSTRACT I OWN HAS ITS STAYING POWER
I'D BE RELUCTANT TO DISTILL MINE MUCH MANY OF THE PEOPLE I PLAY WITH AREN'T REALLY GAMERS SO THE THEME IS VERY IMPORTANT I HAVE TONS OF MEDIUM COMPLEXITY PLAYER GAMES SO OBJECTIVELY I COULD GET RID OF MOST OF THEM HOWEVER ROTATING BETWEEN THEM KEEPS THINGS MORE INTERESTING FOR ME SINCE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DEPTH TO JUST PLAY ONE
IF I GOT RID OF MASS MARKET GAMES I'D PROBABLY BE SITTING RIGHT AROUND GAMES THAT SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH
QUICK ANSWER RIGHT NOW GAMES

I'M A RECENT DAD AND IT'S ON A WORK NIGHT I TOOK A LOOK AT MY COLLECTION OF BOARD GAMES EXCLUDING THE COUPLE DOZEN SMALL FORM FACTOR CARD BOARD GAMES AND EVALUATED WHICH OF THE GAMES IN MY COLLECTION WOULD I BE EXCITED TO START PLAYING RIGHT NOW REGARDLESS OF AND THE NORMAL EXCUSES AND REASONS I SHOULD BE IN BED INSTEAD THESE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT WOULD CUT THROUGH ALL THAT AND GET ON THE TABLE ASSUMING I HAD PLAYERS TO HAND

GALAXY TRUCKER

CAVERN

A GAME OF THRONES BG

BATTLEDORE 2ND ED

CARCASSONNE

NOT QUITE THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION BUT IT GETS TO THE HEART OF WHAT GAMES GIVE YOU THE MOST ENJOYMENT WHILE STILL HAVING VARIABILITY AND REPLACEABILITY THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME THINGS MISSING FROM THE ABOVE BUT BETWEEN VARIABLE SETUPS OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL EXPANSIONS AND DEPTH OF THE ABOVE GAMES I COULD EASILY SEE MYSELF GETTING IN PLAYS OF THIS CYCLE OF GAMES BEFORE STARTING TO NEED TO INJECT FRESH CONTENTION THINKING BACK TO BREAKING INTO THE HOBBY IN THE MID S I PLAYED THE DEATH OUT OF CATAN AND NEVER GOT TIRED OF IT NO REASON I COULDN'T DO THE SAME WITH THESE IF I WAS FOR SOME REASON LIMITED TO THEM
HAVE SOMEONE IN THE GROUP THAT IS THE BEST TEACHER BORROW THE GAME GIVE THEM TIME TO READ THE RULES AND PLAY A PRACTICE GAME THEN LET THEM EXPLAIN TO EVERYONE HOW TO PLAY

LEARNING THE RULES RIGHT THEN AND THERE FOR EVERYONE IS GOING TO CAUSE A HEADACHE EVERY TIME
READING LEARNING THE RULES PRIOR TO THE GAME NIGHT IS PRETTY MUCH KEY


I WILL ALMOST NEVER PULL A GAME OUT WITH PEOPLE OVER WITHOUT KNOWING THE GAME MYSELF THAT MEANS I'VE OPENED IT UNPACKED IT READ THE RULES SET IT UP PLAYED A PRACTICE GAME OR ROUND IF IT'S A GAME OF REPEATED ROUNDS PUT IT BACK SET IT UP AGAIN MADE SURE I COULD IDENTIFY EACH BIT AND CARD AND WHERE THEY GO GIVE A SHORT PREAMBLE OF THIS IS HOW YOU WIN HERE'S HOW YOU WORK YOUR WAY TO A WIN SPEECH

AND IF IT'S A VERY RULES HEAVY GAME AND I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE PLAYED I'LL ASK EVERYONE COMING OVER TO TAKE MINUTES BEFORE ARRIVING TO WATCH A LET'S PLAY VIDEO AND THEN WHEN THEY ARRIVE WE CAN HAVE A QUICK ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE BEGIN CHAT
BRINGING OUT NEW GAMES HEAVIER THAN SAY CARCASSONNE REQUIRES PREPARATION ON PART OF THE HOST OWNER UNPACK THE GAME BEFORE GAME NIGHT READ AND REREAD THE RULES UNTIL YOU CAN TEACH THE OVERARCHING POINTS OF HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED AND DO A PRACTICE SETUP AND TEARDOWN WHICH WILL INFORM YOUR DECISION ON HOW TO BAG ALL THE PIECES AND WHATNOT FOR THE QUICKEST DEPLOYMENT
JUST ACCEPT THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES IN THE FIRST PLAYTHROUGH AND DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME SEARCHING THE RULEBOOK FOR SOME SMALL RULE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE PRESENT IN THE RULEBOOK IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT RIGHT AWAY COME TO A DECISION AND STICK WITH IT

IF YOU'RE THE OWNER AND THE ONE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO TEACH IT MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE GAME WELL AHEAD OF TIME WATCH SEVERAL VIDEOS READ THE RULES AND LOOK ONLINE FOR ANY FAQ ERRATA EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU'LL COME ACROSS A VIDEO THAT DOES SUCH A GREAT JOB TEACHING THAT IT'S EASIER TO JUST SIT ALL YOUR FRIENDS DOWN AND WATCH THE VIDEO WITH THEM INSTEAD OF TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE GAME ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS BLOOD RAGE THE WATCH IT PLAYED FOR BLOOD RAGE IS THE BEST ONE OF THOSE I'VE FOUNDATION MINUTES EVERYTHING IS TAUGHT AND IT'S EASY TO FOLLOW

IF YOU DO END UP HAVING TO EXPLAIN THE WHOLE THING GIVE THE PLAYERS WHAT THEY NEED TO GET STARTED FOR EXAMPLE IN GAMES WITH LOTS OF COMBAT RULES JUST SAY COMBAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU DO X ACTION AND I'LL EXPLAIN HOW COMBAT WORKS WHEN IT HAPPENS IT HELPS TO NOT OVERWHELM THEM RIGHT AWAY
THE BEST METHOD I KNOW OF IS TO HAVE SOMEONE SPEND A GOOD CHUNK OF TIME A COUPLE HOURS PROBABLY READING THE RULES AND PLAYING A ROUND OR TWO BY THEMSELVES BEFORE TEACHING THE GAME TO OTHERS

IF THIS PREPARATION HAS NOT BEEN DONE ME AND MY FRIENDS WILL JUST PLAY SOMETHING ELSE LIKE YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW OF ANY GOOD WAY TO SPEED IT UP WATCHING A YOUTUBE VIDEO IS INTERESTING AND MIGHT HELP BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE OF THIS KINDS OF VIDEOS THEY OFTEN AREN'T PERFECT AND YOU WILL HAVE TO CHECK THE BOOK ANYWAY
I THINK WHEN HOSTING ANY GAME SESSION THE OWNER HOST SHOULD HAVE READ ALL THE RULES AND IDEALLY DONE A TEST RUN EITHER ON THEIR OWN OR GRAB OTHER

THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD RULES SUMMARY HOW TO PLAY VIDEOS WHICH CAN BE A WAY TO START A SESSION I THINK IT HARD FOR PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION THOUGH

ONE OTHER THING WHEN PLAYING I FIND IS TO NOT BE TOO MUCH OF A RULE STICKLER IF IT WOULD RUIN THE FLOW IN A FIRST GAME IGNORE SOME RULES OR EXPLAIN THEM LATER IN THE GAME I DO THIS WITH MORE COMPLEX GAMES SOMETIMES AS OTHERWISE PLAYERS JUST GET OVERWHELMED AFTER THE FIRST GAME THOUGH YOU CAN INTRODUCE ALL THE RULES AS EVERYONE HAS THE BASICS DOWN

GALAXY TRUCKER IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A GAME THAT HAS THIS BUILT IN FOR YOUR FIRST GAME IGNORING SOME RULES WISH MORE GAMES DID THAT

OVERALL THOUGH THIS IS THE WORST PART ABOUT THE HOBBY I LOOK FORWARD TO ONE DAY THERE BEING A BETTER SYSTEM FOR TRACKING AND TEACHING RULES SOME SORT OF AUGMENTED REALITY DEVICE

I LEARN THE SHIT OUT OF THE RULES TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN ANSWER PRETTY MUCH ANY QUESTION THROWN MY WAY THIS MIGHT NOT BE HELPFUL FOR YOUR GROUP BUT AS MY TEACHER THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FOR ME
FOR HEAVIER GAMES I TEND TO FIND THE BEST TUTORIAL VIDEO I CAN AND SEND IT TO EVERYBODY I INTEND TO PLAY WITH A FEW DAYS BEFORE OUR GAME NIGHT THAT WAY WE ONLY END UP USING THE RULEBOOK FOR ELABORATIONS AND SUCH

NATURALLY THIS WON'T WORK IN EVERY SITUATION THE BIGGEST DRAWBACKS BEING GAMES THAT DON'T HAVE INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AND PLAYERS THAT MAY NOT WATCH THEM AT ALL EVEN WHEN THEY'RE AVAILABLE

SO FAR MY GROUP HAS WATCHED THESE TUTORIALS EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT FAIL AND IT HAS WORKED A TREAT DEAD OF WINTER INCLUDED YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY
AS THE PERSON BRINGING THE GAME TO THE TABLE YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE RULES REASONABLY WELL SO YOU CAN ANSWER THE MORE OBVIOUS QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE ASKED READ THE RULEBOOK WATCH VIDEOS WHATEVER IT TAKES FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE GAME IT'S NO FUN IF HALF OF THE GAME IS WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO READ THE RULEBOOK EVERY MINUTES I PERSONALLY WILL READ THE RULEBOOK IN FULL AND WATCH A YOUTUBE VIDEO OR TWO SINCE SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A RULE MEANS OR WHAT IT'S TRYING TO DO
I PERSONALLY LIKE CARDS WITH CONDENSED RULES ON THEM FOR EVERYONE THINGS LIKE WHAT YOU CAN DO ON YOUR TURN WHAT YOU CAN DO ON SOMEONE TURN WHAT THE WIN CONDITION S ARE WHAT THE PIECES ARE AND SOME SIMPLE INFO ABOUT THE STUFF ON THE BOARD THAT WAY YOU CAN GO OVER THE RULES ONCE AND EVERYONE CAN BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE BASICS INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PASS THE BOOK AROUND A BUNCH

IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO PUT ON THE CARDS BUT AFTER YOU'VE PLAYED YOU CAN PUT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WAS MOST CONFUSING TO YOU AND IF YOU'RE PRINTING THEM OUT EACH TIME YOU CAN LEAVE A SPOT FOR NOTES
DITTO I WILL NEVER BRING OUT A GAME IF I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO READ THE RULES AND TRY OUT A FEW TURNS MYSELF

THERE IS ALSO A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH NEW INFORMATION FOLKS CAN ABSORB BEFORE THEY JUST START SWITCHING OFF AND IT JUST ALL STARTS GETTING JUMBLED UP SO FOR GAMES WITH LOTS OF RULES I FIND THAT YOU CAN'T JUST SIT DOWN AND START EXPLAINING EVERY RULE THERE ARE SOME RULES THAT AREN'T GOING TO IMPACT THEIR STRATEGY AND ARE BETTER LEFT TO BE EXPLAINED LATER DURING THE GAME WHEN THAT SITUATION OCCURS

I HAVE ALSO STARTED SHOWING AND EXPLAINING AN EXAMPLE TURN THEN RESETTING THE GAME
I ALWAYS PLAY IT THROUGH FIRST AFTER WATCHING A MINUTE VIDEO EXPLAINING THE GAME AND READING THROUGH THE RULE BOOK
IT IS ALMOST NEVER A GOOD IDEA TO OPEN A GAME AND TRY TO LEARN IT TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME I TYPICALLY TEACH THE GAMES HAVING READ THRU THE RULEBOOK AND PLAYED A COUPLE PRETEND ROUNDS BY MYSELF PREVIOUSLY I'M ALSO A TEACHER BY TRADE SO THAT MIGHT HELP EVEN IF IT'S NOT MY GAME I USUALLY END UP WITH THE RULEBOOK AFTER YEARS OF PLAYING TOGETHER I'M THE ONE MOST TRUSTED TO BE THOROUGH AND FAIR
CAN YOU PLAY A FEW GAMES OF NORMAL RISK BEFORE STARTING THE LEGACY PART

YOU CAN INDEED THE BOARD IS SET UP AS NORMAL RISK IS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY ALTERATIONS TO ANYTHING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO

AT THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN YOU RECEIVE A CARD WITH TWO STICKERS ON IT YOU CHOOSE ONE AND APPLY IT TO YOUR RACE AND TEAR THE OTHER ONE UP NEVER TO BE USED PROBABLY WAIT ON THAT AS WELL IF YOU'RE INTRODUCING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME

I WOULD HOWEVER RECOMMEND PLAYING TO STARS OR POINTS INSTEAD OF THE ORIGINAL RISK WIN CONDITION OF TOTAL DOMINATION

HOW FRIENDLY IS IT TO LEARN

IT IS NOT OVERLY COMPLEX BUT YOU WILL NEED TO READ THE RULEBOOK BEFOREHAND AND MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND IT TO SUFFICIENTLY GUIDE THEM THROUGH HOW TO PLAY YOU CAN FIND THE RULEBOOK ONLINE TO READ BEFORE YOU BUY IT TO SEE IF THE COMPLEXITY LEVEL IS MORE THAN THEY COULD HANDLE

HOWEVER POWER GRID IS WEIGHTED AT ON BG WITH RISK LEGACY ONLY AT SO THEY'VE PLAYED HEAVIER

IS THIS A GOOD REPLACEMENT STEP UP FOR CATAN

I WOULD SAY THE ONLY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT THEY BOTH HAVE DICE A BETTER UPGRADE GAME WOULD PERHAPS BE SOMETHING LIKE THE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY
CAN YOU PLAY A FEW GAMES OF NORMAL RISK BEFORE STARTING THE LEGACY PART

EH KINDA

REASON BEING MY FAMILY HAS NEVER PLAYED RISK BEFORE

THIS IS RISK LIKE BUT NOT RISK

HOW FRIENDLY IS IT TO LEARN

IT'S PRETTY FRIENDLY

THE HEAVIEST GAME MY FAMILY HAS PLAYED IS POWER GRID AND EVEN THEN I CAN'T BRING IT OUT OFTEN AS IT IS A LITTLE TOO LONG AND MATHY FOR THEM

THE HARDEST PART OF RL IS THE SETUP IT IS EASIER THAN PG

IS THIS A GOOD REPLACEMENT STEP UP FOR CATAN

IT'S AN INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT GAME

IT'S NOT THAT I HATE CATAN BUT YOU DO GET BURNED OUT AFTER PLAYING EVERY NIGHT DOESN'T BURN OUT MY FAMILY THOUGH AS IT'S ALL THEY WANT TO PLAY

TRY

BOARDGAME CHINATOWN

BOARDGAME VITICULTURE

BOARDGAME

OR

BOARDGAME
IF YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM AN INTRO WITH MINIS YOU COULD LOOK INTO SPACE HULK

THAT BEING SAID I RECOMMEND THIS ONE A LOT ON HERE BUT MICE AND MYSTICS IS AN EASY TO LEARN FUN TO PLAY GAME WITH MINIS IT'S A NARRATIVE RPG FOR TO PLAYERS THE MINIS AREN'T PREPRINTED HOWEVER

I THINK CLAUSTROPHOBIA HAS PREPRINTED MINIS I'VE NEVER PLAYED IT MYSELF THOUGH SO I CAN'T VOUCH FOR HOW GOOD IT IS
HAS PRETTY WIDE APPEAL BECAUSE STAR WARS RULES ARE SURPRISINGLY SIMPLE AND CAN BE FUN FOR A BEGINNER ON THE FIRST GAME ALSO THEY SELL THE CORE SET AT PLACES LIKE TARGET SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO FREAK THEM OUT BY TAKING THEM INTO A PROPER GAME STORE TO PICK UP A COPY OR MAYBE TRY GETTING A COPY OF THE NEW EDITION OF BLOOD BOWL IT'S GONNA BE MORE COMPLICATED THAN BUT IT'S FOOTBALL SO PEOPLE WILL GO IN WITH SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIC OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME
LOOK UP KILL TEAM FOR MAYBE IT'LL BE GENTLER OR RE EVALUATE HOW YOU EXPLAIN IT
HEROCLIX IF THEY ARE INTO SUPERHEROES AXIS ALIBIES MINIATURES BY WIZARD OF THE COAST IF THEY ARE INTO HISTORICAL GAMES THERE IS ALSO A NAVAL VERSION IF THEY LIKE FLEET ACTION MINIATURES
FOR STAR WARS OR ARMADA FOR LARGER SCALE ACTION THERE WAS MECH WARRIOR MINI GAME THAT CAME PREPRINTED BUT I NEVER PLAYED SO I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH HOW COMPLICATED THE RULE
SET WAS
GEARS OF WAR
FOUND JACK OF ALL DOMINION WHICH MIGHT HELP CAN'T VOUCH FOR IT THOUGH
R DOMINION HAS KINGDOM OF THE WEEK WHERE A NEW KINGDOM IS UP FOR DISCUSSION EVERY WEEK I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S DESIGNED NOT RANDOM OF COURSE IT ASSUMES YOU HAVE ALL EXPANSIONS SINCE IT CONSTRUCTS FROM ALL AVAILABLE EXPANSIONS BUT SOMETIMES YOU HIT JACKPOT AND GET A KINGDOM THAT ONLY USES CARDS YOU HAVE

GOING BACK AS FAR AS THE BEGINNING OF I FOUND THESE

YOU CAN CONTINUE SEARCHING YOURSELF FOR EVEN OLDER ONES

I DON'T HAVE IBERIA SO I CAN'T SAY TO MUCH ABOUT IT BUT TO ME IT SEEMS IT'S MOSTLY A STRONGER THEME ADDED SINCE THE DISEASES HAVE ACTUAL NAMES MALARIA STUFF LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF JUST COLORS AND A VARIANT ABOUT DEALING WITH PATIENTS I DO HAVE OTB AND I WILL SAY THAT IT'S VERY FUN THE VIRULENT STRAIN EPIDEMIC CARDS CAN REALLY MAKE YOU THINK SINCE ONE DISEASE WILL MUTATE AND GET DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH WHICH IS GREAT I HARDLY EVER PLAY PANDEMIC WITHOUT IT THE EXTRA EPIDEMIC CARD MAKES YOU ABLE TO PLAY WITH AND THE NEW EVENT CARDS ARE ALSO AWESOME MUTANT VARIANT WASN'T ALL THAT GREAT AND I HAVEN'T YET PLAYED WITH THE SINCE I NORMALLY PLAY WITH JUST MY F SO ALL THAT CONSIDERED I'D SAY IF THE THEME IS SUPER IMPORTANT AND YOU REALLY LIKE THAT THEN IBERIA BUT FOR MORE GAME PLAY OPTIONS I'D SAY THE EXPANSIONS


I TOTALLY FORGOT THERE WAS A FIRST EDITION UNTIL NOW WHEN I ENCOUNTERED THIS PROBLEM I SOLD MY COPY OF PANDEMIC FOR ON CRAIGSLIST AND ENDING UP BUYING THE SECOND EDITION FOR ABOUT THE SAME PRICE UNLESS YOU REALLY PREFER FIRST EDITION I'D TRY AND SELL IT AND USE THAT MONEY TO BUY THE UP TO DATE VERSION THAT WAY YOU CAN GET ANY EXPANSIONS YOU WANT DOWN THE LINE
IBERIA IS A ONE TIME PRINT RUN SO IF YOU'RE WANTING THAT GAME AT ALL I WOULD SAY GO FOR THAT THE EXPANSIONS SHOULD BE AROUND FOR QUITE A WHILE


ON THE BRINK IS THE ONLY EXPANSION I HAVE BUT I'M HAPPY WITH IT IT HAS ENOUGH WAYS TO CHANGE THE GAME EXTRA CHALLENGES AND LOTS OF EXTRA ROLES AND EVENTS
THERE ARE TWO VISITOR CARDS BROKER AND UNAUTHORIZED BROKER I THINK THAT LET YOU TRADE LIRA WITH VP ALSO IT'S USED AS TIEBREAKER AND THAT'S IT

IN THE TUSCANY BOARD THERE'S THE TRADE FOR SPOT AKA BEST SPOT EVER LETS YOU TRADE LIRA TO VP AS WELL
YES MONEY IS ALSO USED AS A TIE BREAKER
VITICULTURE IS IN MY TOP ALL TIME IT'S A CLASSIC THAT EVERYONE SHOULD AT LEAST PLAY AND THEN DECIDE IF THEY WANT IT IN THEIR COLLECTION

DOES WRITING EVERYTHING IN CAPS MAKE IT HIGH ENERGY
YOUR NOTE FOR PANDEMIC IS MISPLACED SHOULD BE LISTED UNDER PANDEMIC LEGACY I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT NOBODY NEEDS TO OWN BOTH UNLESS THEY REALLY LOVE IT I HAVE BOTH AND AFTER A FEW GAMES OF LEGACY I'LL PROBABLY NEVER TOUCH THE VANILLA GAME AGAIN THERE IS A DICE GAME VERSION CALLED PANDEMIC THE CURE WHICH I LIKE MORE ACTUALLY

I SEE STAR REALMS ON YOUR LIST I DON'T LIKE IT AS MUCH AS ASCENSION DESPITE THE SIMILARITIES

TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES IS GREAT MY GROUP IS IN LOVE WITH IT BUT YOU REALLY WANT TO PLAY IT PLAYERS AND THE SAME PLAYERS EACH TIME YOU GET ONE MODULE WITH THE BASE GAME WHICH YOU WILL PLAY PROBABLY TIMES THEN YOU'RE DONE YOU NEED TO GET MORE MODULES TO PLAY WHICH YOU COULD PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT GROUP IF YOU CAN'T GET THE SAME PLAYERS TO COMMIT WE'RE ON THE SECOND MODULE AND AT THE MOMENT I PLAN TO BUY EVERYTHING THEY THROW AT THE MARKET IT'S MORE OF AN ADVENTURE LIKE A BOOK THAN A GAME REALLY THOUGH YOU DO HAVE DICE TO ROLL SOMETIMES IT FEELS THE MOST LIKE A VIDEO GAME OUT OF EVERYTHING I'VE PLAYED SO FAR

DEAD OF WINTER IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES I DON'T GENERALLY LIKE THE ZOMBIE THEME BUT THIS ONE IS MORE ABOUT THE SURVIVORS TRYING TO SURVIVE BUT ALSO FULFIL THEIR OWN OBJECTIVES WITH A POSSIBLE BETRAYER IN THE GROUP IT ALWAYS GOES OVER WELL THOUGH SOME PEOPLE HERE IN THIS SUB DON'T LIKE IT

THE RESISTANCE WAS MY FAVOURITE GAME UP UNTIL I GOT DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG IF YOU CAN GET OR MORE PEOPLE TOGETHER IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD TIME BUT I CAN ONLY STAND PLAYING IT ABOUT TIMES IN A ROW BECAUSE I FIND IT AND I START CONFUSING WHAT HAPPENED IN PREVIOUS GAMES WITH THE CURRENT ONE IT'S ALSO CHEAP SO IT'S WORTH HAVING

I LIKE ROLL FOR THE GALAXY A LOT BUT IT FEELS VERY I FIND THE THEME DOESN'T SHINE THROUGH VERY WELL FOR ME POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE WORKERS AREN'T MEEDLESS BUT DICE AND MY BRAIN DOESN'T MAKE THE CONNECTION EASILY BUT IT'S QUITE FUN

COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS A BLAST BUT YOU SHOULD AIM TO PLAY IT IN A GROUP OF OR MORE WITH EXPANSIONS MY WIFE ISN'T TOO KEEN ON IT BECAUSE PEOPLE WE PLAY WITH GET TOO BUT I LIKE IT A TON I'D PLAY IT WEEKLY IF I COULD IT'S NOT TOM GAME FOR NOTHING

AMONG THE STARS I LIKE YOU NOTE THAT IT SEEMS COMPETITIVE I DUNNO IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A CO-OP GAME BUT EVEN RADIO AND HIS WIFE SEEM TO LIKE IT EVEN WITH THE REVIVAL STANDALONE EXPANSION IN THE MIX WHICH ADDS MORE DIRECT CONFRONTATION

UNSPEAKABLE WORDS IS ALRIGHT I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BUY IT MYSELF BUT I WOULD PLAY IT AGAIN IF OTHER PEOPLE WANTED TO YOU JUST MAKE WORDS WITH CARDS AND YOU ROLL DICE AND POSSIBLY LOSE SANITY IT'S KINDA FUNNY WHEN YOU GET TO MAKE UP WORDS IF YOU GO INSANE BUT ALSO GETS KINDA OLD FAST IT WAS STILL ENJOYABLE BUT THE GROUP I PLAYED WITH DELUXE EDITION WAS A LITTLE LARGE FOR MY LIKING A LOT OF DOWNTIME BASE GAME HAS A MORE SENSIBLE LIMIT I THINK

ELDER SIGN IS RANDOM YES BUT I STILL ENJOY IT I LIKE PLAYING IT ON MY PHONE OR PC THOUGH BECAUSE THE PHYSICAL GAME HAS A LOT OF PARTS TO DEAL WITH AND I'D RATHER JUST PLAY IT ON MY OWN FASTEST WAY TO DO IT IS DIGITALLY

TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL IS KINDA BORING TO ME TOO MUCH COMBAT NOT ENOUGH EXPLORATION AND STUFF IT'S LIKE BASICALLY D D LITE BUT NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF IPCS OR ANYTHING BEYOND LOTS OF MONSTERS ATTACKING I DUNNO I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY IT BOTH IN SOLO AND IN CO-OP WITH A FRIEND

LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN IS A MUCH BETTER GAME THAN MARVEL LEGENDARY IN MY OPINION I THINK PEOPLE LIKE MARVEL MORE BECAUSE OF THE THEME BEING MORE PALATABLE TO A WIDER AUDIENCE BUT I DIDN'T ENJOY IT THE THEME IS KINDA ABSENT AND THE GAME MECHANICS ARE JUST BORING HONESTLY BUT ALIEN FIXES THAT SCANNING THE ROOMS BEFORE KNOWING WHAT IS COMING TO ATTACK MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE AND THE WAY THAT PLAYERS CAN CONTROL ALIENS ETC I DUNNO IT'S JUST A LOT BETTER GAME IN MY OPINION THAT SAID I DID SELL IT BECAUSE OF THE ANNOYING SETUP TIMES AND IT ISN'T ENJOYABLE SOLO FOR ME IN ITS PLACE FOR A CO-OP DECKBUILDER I'VE GOT ATTACK ON TITAN ON THE WAY TO ME IT JUST LOOKS MORE LIKE WHAT I AM AFTER BUT IF YOU WANT A LEGENDARY GAME I STRONGLY RECOMMEND ALIEN OVER THE OTHERS THERE'S AN EXPANSION COMING OUT SOONISH TOO

I HAVE BLUE MOON LEGENDS BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET

I THINK THAT'S ALL I CAN REALLY COMMENT ON I HOPE IT HELPS A LITTLE
THERE IS A CONVENTION COMING UP IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS YOU MIGHT HAVE A LOOK AT WINTERCON

STERLING HEIGHTS MICHIGAN BOARDGAMER HERE

IT'S A BIT HARD TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT YOU LIKE OR DISLIKE ABOUT GAMES FROM THE COMMENTS SINCE YOU DON'T SEEM TO INCLUDE MUCH IN THE WAY OF DETAILS YOU DON'T SEEM TO LIKE ANG MUCH BUT I'D BE HARD PRESSED TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU DO LIKE

I CAN TELL YOU THAT MARKHAM HORROR IS GOING TO PLAY OUT A LOT LIKE BETRAYAL BUT MUCH LONGER AND MORE FIDDLY IF YOU'RE NOT INTO THE HEMATICS OF HOVERCRAFT SO MUCH THAT YOU CAN GET PAST THE ANG YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT SAME WITH ELDRITCH SIGN KING OF NEW YORK TOKYO PLAY A LOT LIKE YAHTZEE BUT BETTER WHICH IS BASICALLY ALL ANG MARVEL LEGENDARY IS ONE OF THE WORSE DECKBUILDERS I CAN THINK OF WHEN IT COMES TO ANG ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO DOMINION OR THUNDERSTONE OR SIMILAR GAMES THAT HAVE CONSTANT MARKETS

MY ACTUAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE SCI-FI END ARE RACE FOR THE GALAXY USES ANG BUT WITH SUCH A HIGH VOLUME OF CARD DRAWS THE LUCK TENDS TO BE PRETTY MITIGATED OR EMINENT DOMAIN WHICH IS AN EXCELLENT SPACE DECKBUILDER TABLEAU BUILDER OR SPACE ALERT WHICH IS A CO-OP PANICKY ACTION GAME ABOUT A SHIP FALLING APART I DON'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND GALAXY TRUCKER BUT YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A PLAY IF YOU EVER HAVE THE CHANCE FABULOUS GAME FOR THOSE WHO LIKE IT YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE BATTLESTEAD BOARDGAME I'VE NEVER PLAYED BUT IT'S A CO-OP GAME THAT'S CONSISTENTLY COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS A HIGHLY REGARDED ALIEN COMBAT GAME THAT I COULDN'T GET INTO BUT IT'S SHORT FOR A GAME LIKE THAT AND DOESN'T HAVE THE FIDDLY BITS OF A LOT OF OTHER GAMES

ON THE FANTASY END THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF GAMES TO PICK FROM BUT I DON'T THINK I'D BE AS COMFORTABLE MAKING SUGGESTIONS THERE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SPECIFIC GAME MECHANICS YOU'RE INTO
KINGDOM BUILDER IS VERY EASY TO PLAY BUT TAKES A BIT MORE INSIGHT AND EXPERIENCE TO EXTRACT ALL OF ITS POTENTIAL IT'S AN ABSTRACT WITH A LIGHT THEME PASTED ON

YOU CAN ALSO START BY PLAYING WITH OBJECTIVE CARDS THAT ARE EASY TO GRASP SUCH AS THE FISHERMAN MINER AND THE WORKER IT'S A GAME SHE CAN DEFINITELY PLAY BUT IT WILL TAKE HER A FEW PLAYS TO FULL UNDERSTAND IT IN HER DEFENSE THIS IS THE CASE FOR MOST PEOPLE MY ONLY KNOCK ON IT IS IT HAS A THEME THAT MANY KIDS MIGHT NOT BE INTO BUT YOU KNOW HER BEST MAYBE SHE IS INTO FEUDAL LAND GRAB GAMES

IF YOU GET IT I WOULD ALSO GET THE APPARENTLY IT WILL HONE YOUR SKILLS AS YOU PLAY THE AI

OTHER SUGGESTIONS

STONE AGE
LANTERNS
SPLENDOR
MICE AND MYSTICS GREAT KID FRIENDLY DUNGEON CRAWLER
NEW YORK
FORBIDDEN ISLAND DESERT
KINGDOM BUILDER IS A SLIGHT SET UP IN DIFFICULTY COMPARED TO TR AS KB HAS A BIT MORE ABSTRACT STRATEGY TO MAXIMIZING YOUR MOVES ON A GIVEN TURN SOME OF THE BONUS TILES AND SCORING SYSTEMS CAN BE A BIT OBTUSE FOR A LIGHT FAMILY GAME AS WELL BUT IN GENERAL SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD

A FEW OTHER GAMING OPTIONS ARE THURN UND TAXIS WHICH IS SIMILAR TO TR BUT WITH A FEW VARIABLE POWERS CARCASSONNE WHICH IS A NICE RELAXING GAME WITH DECENTLY SIMPLE SCORING ARUBA WHICH IS A WITH A PUZZLE ELEMENT PLUS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STONE AGE A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD GAME
WE PLAYED KB ONE NIGHT WITH SOMEONE'S LITTLE GIRL AND IT WENT FINE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW OLD SHE WAS BUT ABOUT THAT AGE
MY YEAR OLD TOOK WELL TO WONDERS DUEL EIGHT MINUTE EMPIRE AND CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY INSIGHT ON KINGDOM BUILDER GETTING IT FOR CHRISTMAS TOO
HELLO THERE

AS A KINGDOM BUILDER OWNER AND FAN THERE'S NO REASON YOUR YEAR-OLD KID SISTER SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT PROVIDED YOU CAREFULLY EXPLAIN THE THREE VICTORY REWARDS FOR ANY PARTICULAR GAME THE POINTS YOU GET FOR BUILDING NEXT TO A CASTLE THE TILE POWERS AND THE ADJACENCY RULES FOR LAYING DOWN NEW DWELLINGS

IF SHE CAN MENTALLY GRASP HOW TO STRATEGICALLY FILL UP AN AREA SO SHE CAN LEGALLY JUMP TO ANOTHER AREA SHE'LL BE ALL SET

BEST OF ALL THE GAME IS SHORT MIN MAX SO EVEN IF YOU FLUB THE FIRST ATTEMPT YOU CAN JUST GO AGAIN

GOOD LUCK AND TAKE CARE
IT CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T BE TOO COMPLEX BUT I WONDER IF SHE'LL ENJOY IT I LOVE KINGDOM BUILDER AND I'VE TAUGHT IT TO A FEW KIDS IN THE AGE RANGE THEY'VE ALL PLAYED JUST FINE BUT THEY DIDN'T PARTICULARLY LOVE OR HATE THE GAME THEY JUST THOUGHT IT WAS OK MAYBE SOME OTHER PEOPLE HERE HAVE SOME KIDS WHO LOVE KB AND CAN CHIME IN AGAIN I'M A BIG FAN IT JUST HASN'T BEEN A HIT WITH KIDS

YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT SPLENDOR OR CARCASSONNE I'VE PLAYED WITH KIDS WHO LOVE THOSE TWO GAMES SPLENDOR BECAUSE I THINK IT'S FUN TO COLLECT THINGS AND SEE YOUR SCORE ACCELERATE AS YOU BUILD A BIG COMBO AND THE CHIPS ARE VERY TACTILE AND CARCASSONNE BECAUSE IT'S FUN BUILDING A MAP KIDS DON'T EVEN CARE IF THEY WIN THEY JUST LIKE PLAYING THEIR PIECES I'VE ONLY PLAYED TAKENOKO WITH ADULTS BUT IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD ALSO BE A HIT FOR KIDS THAT AGE THE THEME IS CUTE AND IT'S SIMILAR TO TICKET TO RIDE WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO COMPLETE SECRET OBJECTIVES AND STOP YOUR OPPONENTS
CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD BUT PREIMAGINED IN THE WIRE OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR DRUG DEALERS VS COPS GAME WHAT I HAVE IN MIND IS DIFFERENT GANGS FIGHTING FOR TERRITORY 4TH PLAYER IS LIKE HORNE BUT HE IS THE COPS INSTEAD OF KILLING DUDES HE ARRESTS THEM THE GANGS COULD BE DEALERS OF DIFFERENT DRUGS OLD WORLD CARDS ARE GOING TO BE THINGS LIKE OMAR IS COMING ETC I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL

NUNS ON THE RUN IN THE HARRY POTTER UNIVERSE STUDENTS AT EVADING PATROLLING TEACHERS AND POSSIBLY MONSTERS

TANTO CHORE IN JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER IP SO THAT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A PERVERT FOR PLAYING THE GAME I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE GAME IS LIKE AND NOT HAVE TO CALL MY NEIGHBORS WHEN I MOVE INTO AN AREA
I FEEL VICEROY COULD WORK AS A GAME ABOUT BUILDING A COMPANY EXECUTIVE STRUCTURE NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANY FICTIONAL UNIVERSE THAT MATCHES THAT THEME

MOST SCI-FI GAMES COULD BE CHANGED TO MATCH A SCI-FI THEME FOR EXAMPLE REPLACE ALL THE RACES IN FORBIDDEN STARS WITH STAR TREK RACES SECRET HITLER COULD BE CHANGED TO ANY NUMBER OF THEMES INCLUDING BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA HARRY POTTER OR EVEN TO MATCH THE DEAD OF WINTER UNIVERSE
I'D LOVE TO SEE A STAR TREK VERSION OF ROLL FOR THE GALAXY I ALSO REALLY REALLY WANT YOUNG JUSTICE AND LOAR DICE MASTERS

WOULD LOVE TO SEE A DUNGEON CRAWL BASED ON THE ANES GAME LIFIA 2
GAME OF THRONES IS A MUCH HEAVIER GAME BUT I WOULD SAY THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS MAKING ALLIANCES IN GOT YOU WORK WITH YOUR ALLYS TO MUTUALLY BENEFIT UNTIL ONE BACK STABS THE OTHER

THIS IS AWESOME UNTIL ONE OF THE PLAYERS FEELS GANGED UP ON AND GETS MAD SIGH IT HAD SUCH POTENTIAL IN MY GROUP
THE GAME IS PRETTY INTUITIVE ONCE YOU PLAY A ROUND OR TWO IT ALL BECOMES SECOND NATURE THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THE GAME IS THAT IT IS FULL OF GAME THEORY KING MAKER PROBLEMS AND FACTION BALANCE ISSUES PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO PLAY A CERTAIN WAY FOR EXAMPLE GREY JOY MUST GO AFTER STARK OR BANNISTER IF THEY GO AFTER TYRE FOR SOME REASON THEY BASICALLY HANDED BANNISTER THE GAME HOWEVER IF THEY GO AFTER BANNISTER THEY HAVE A GOOD CHANCE AT WIPING OUT THE BANNISTER BY THE SECOND OR THIRD ROUND
I THINK GOT WOULD FIT YOU PERFECTLY IF YOU DON'T MIND THE BACKSTABBING IT IS A LOT HEAVIER GAME THAN BLOOD RAGE BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S A BETTER GAME

IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE LENGTH YOU CAN MAKE IT A BIT FASTER WITH THE EXPANSIONS A DANCE WITH DRAGONS FOR PLAYERS AND A FEAST FOR CROWS FOR PLAYERS THEY ALSO CHANGE THE VICTORY POINT RULES SO I RECOMMEND PLAYING WITHOUT THEM TOO WHILE THE GAME HAS QUITE A LOT OF DIFFERENT RULES IT PLAYS QUITE NATURALLY AFTER YOU'VE PLAYED A COUPLE OF ROUNDS

I ACTUALLY BOUGHT BLOOD RAGE WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A LIGHTWEIGHT GOT
TO ME THE GAME IS LESS DUDES ON A MAP AND MORE HOW MANY MIND GAMES CAN I PLAY AND FRIENDSHIPS I CAN PUT ON THE EDGE TO WIN WITH A SIDE OF DUDES ON A MAP

IT'S NOT A LOT LIKE BLOOD RAGE TO ME BUST STILL VERY FUN EMET IS A MUCH BETTER GAME TO COMPARE IT TO NOT SURE IF IT IS A STEP UP THOUGH

MY TWO CENTS FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH
I LOVE BOTH GAMES GOT HITS THE TABLE ONCE A YEAR AT BEST BLOOD RAGE IS LIKE FRIGGING CATAN GOT IS GREAT FOR THE COLLECTION BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT A HEAVY GAME I RECOMMEND TWILIGHT IMPERIUM IT DOES IT BETTER AND IS WAY MORE SIMPLE TO TEACH EVEN THOUGH THE RULEBOOK IS PAGES LONGER
GOT IS WHAT GOT ME BACK INTO PLAYING BOARD GAMES AGAIN BUT I CAN'T REALLY STAND PLAYING IT NOW TAKES FAR TOO LONG BORING UNTIL THE BOARD IS TIGHT USUALLY TAKES A FEW ROUNDS AND THE WINNER IS USUALLY DECIDED BY SOMEONE MAKING A MISTAKE OR BECAUSE OF INTENTIONAL KING MAKING
IT IS STREAMLINED VERY WELL AND THE GAME IS VERY TACTICAL THE RULES ARE ALSO NOT VERY HEAVY AT ALL YOU BASICALLY JUST HAVE EVERY AREA YOU CONTROL DO AN ACTION LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT OF TOKENS YOU HAVE

ALTHOUGH GOT IS A LOT LONGER THAN BLOOD RAGE AND THATS JUST BECAUSE ITS PLAYED OVER ROUNDS THERE IS A BIDDING WAR AND TALKS ABOUT WHAT YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE GONNA DO OR IF YOU'RE GOING TO TEAM UP

I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT THE BOARD GAME NEEDS PLAYERS TO BE BALANCED AND YOU NEED THE A FEAST FOR CROWS EXPANSION TO BE BALANCED WITH I'VE ONLY PLAYED IT ONCE AS A PLAYER GAME AND IT WAS PRETTY FUN THOUGH IT DID GO ON FOR A BIT TOO LONG IMO
WE PLAYED THIS AT WORK QUITE A FEW TIMES UNTIL WE FINALLY REALIZED WE HATED THE GAME AND PUT A BAN ON IT EVER BEING PLAYED AGAIN LAO

THIS GAME IS VERY UNEVEN AND NOT UNFAIR TO CERTAIN FACTIONS IT RELIES HEAVILY ON MAKING ALLIANCES THAT WILL THEN BE BROKEN I THINK THE BIGGEST THING WE HATED ABOUT IT WAS THE GAME BOARD MAP WHICH THERE'S REALLY NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT THAT

YOU EITHER GANG UP AND TAKE SOMEONE OUT EARLY THUS PISSING THEM OFF OR YOU ALL GO OUT FOR YOURSELVES AND THEN CERTAIN PEOPLE WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOSE PRETTY FAST
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT RESEARCH ON THE BENEFITS OF VIDEO GAMES BUT NOT SO MUCH ABOUT BOARD GAMES THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH ON BOARD GAMES FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW SO MAYBE YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING USEFUL THERE
JANE BOOK SUPERBETTER IS AN INTERESTING STUDY OF THE MENTAL AND SOMETIMES PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF ALL TYPES OF GAMES I HAVEN'T READ IT IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN IS PRETTY GREAT IT'S SORT IF A MEMOIR WITH SCIENTIFIC BACKING AND INTERESTING CHAPTER OBJECTIVES TO COMPLETE
AWING IS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND SOMETHING THAT MY BROTHER AND I LOVE TO PLAY BUILDING A LIST PLANNING OUT A STRATEGY WHICH RARELY WORKS OUT AND THE PURE JOY OF FLYING IS JUST AN AMAZINGLY FUN TIME

IT IS A RABBIT HOLE OF BUYING ALL THE NEW SHIPS SOMETIMES MULTIPLE COPIES AND FINDING A SOLID STORAGE SYSTEM BUT I FEEL IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT THE TACTICAL FEEL AND LOOK OF THIS GAME IS TOP NOTCH

DESTINY IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME WITH A DIFFERENT MODEL YOU'LL BUY A CORE AND THEN BUY PACKS WITH RANDOM DICE AND CARDS IN THEM THIS IS REASON ALONE TO NEVER BUY IT IN MY OPINION I JUST CAN'T SEE MYSELF SPENDING A SHOT TO HOPEFULLY FIND THE PIECES I WANT AND THEN END UP WITH DUPLICATES OF THINGS ALREADY OWNED NO THANK YOU

ULTIMATELY BUT WHAT IS MOST EXCITING FOR YOU AND YOUR OTHER PLAYER MY BROTHER AND I HAVE NEVER PLAYED ANYONE BUT EACH OTHER WITH AWING AND WE LOVE IT THE MONEY IS A REAL THING HERE AND YOU WILL SPEND IT BUT YOU WILL ALSO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET

HAPPY GAMING
I OWN AT LEAST ONE OF EACH SHIP FOR REBEL AND IMPERIAL FACTIONS I DON'T OWN ANY SCUM SHIPS I FIND THAT I DO WELL MAKING SQUADS WITH THESE BUT STORAGE AND KEEPING TRACK OF ALL THE COMPONENTS NEEDED TO PLAY IS A BIT OF A NUISANCE SOMETIMES I LOVE THE GAME THOUGH I MAKE SURE TO GET THE NEW SHIPS WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED EVEN IF I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY I KNOW THEY WILL COME IN HANDY WHEN I DO END UP PLAYING AGAIN PLUS THEY'RE PRETTY COOL TO COLLECTIVE

I PLAYED IN EVENTS FOR STAR WARS DESTINY AND I LOVE IT THE ONLY THINGS YOU REALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AS FAR AS THE NUISANCE FACTOR IS THE DICE AND TOKENS HOWEVER THOSE ARE MUCH EASIER TO CARRY AROUND THAN COMPONENTS

ALSO I BOUGHT A TOTAL OF 2 OF EACH STARTER AND ABOUT BOOSTERS I WAS ABLE TO MAKE TWO COMPETITIVE DECKS OUT OF EVERYTHING I BOUGHT I EVEN ENDED UP PULLING A LEGENDARY VADER WHICH WAS A HUGE BONUS OBVIOUSLY I'M MISSING QUITE A FEW CARDS TO COMPLETE A COLLECTION BUT I HAVE A WINNING RECORD WITH THE CARDS I HAVE

MOST IMPORTANTLY THE GAME IS INSANELY FUN MY WIFE ISN'T INTO GAMING MUCH BUT SHE ACTUALLY ASKS IF WE CAN PLAY SAME THING WITH MY YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IT'S EASY ENOUGH FOR HER TO PLAY EVEN IF SHE DOESN'T REALLY GET WHAT SOME OF THE CARDS DO SHE JUST LOVES ROLLING DICE AND BUILDING UP HER CHARACTERS WITH UPGRADES THE GAME IS ONCE YOU GET INTO IT AND THERE'S ENOUGH STRATEGY TO KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES

I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND DESTINY OVER BUT I STILL HOLD IN VERY HIGH REGARD
I WOULD SUGGEST DESTINY EVEN THOUGH I DON'T PLAY IT X WING IS MEANT TO BE PLAYED IN LOCAL GROUPS SO UNLESS YOU HAVE LOCAL PLAY YOU MIGHT NOT PLAY X WING AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD LIKE ALSO X WING IS AS MUCH ABOUT THE FLYING THEN IT IS THE DICE X WING IS MORE TABLE TOP WAR GAMING THEN A DICE GAME DESTINY IS DESIGNED AS A DICE GAME ALSO X WING CAN GET PRETTY PRICEY TO GET WHAT YOU WANT
THE BEST ANSWER IS PROBABLY TO GET SOME SORT OF INTRO PACK FOR BOTH GAMES AND SEE WHICH ONE YOU LIKE BETTER TWO STARTER DECKS FOR DESTINY IS LSRP WHILE TWO CORE SETS TRUST ME YOU WANT TWO AT LEAST IS LSRP BUT CAN EASILY BE FOUND ONLINE FOR IF YOU WERE PLANNING TO DIVE INTO EITHER OF THESE TWO GAMES I'M GOING TO ASSUME YOU WERE WILL TO SPEND AT LEAST A FUNDED OR TWO INTO BUYING STUFF SO AN INITIAL INVESTMENT OF ABOUT GET A TASTE OF BOTH SHOULD BE REASONABLE HECK YOU MIGHT END UP LIKING BOTH

IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE ONLY ONE I WOULD SUGGEST HAVEN'T TRIED DESTINY I THINK THE FEELING OF FLYING A STAR WARS SHIP REALLY COMES TO LIFE IN WHICH IS AN EXPERIENCE YOU CAN'T REALLY GET IN MOST OTHER GAMES PLUS THE GAME IS VERY EASY TO LEARN AND EASY TO PLAY

FORGIVE MY IGNORANCE BUT DESTINY IS JUST ANOTHER CARD GAME AMONG MANY MANY OTHERS INCLUDING A STAR WARS CG WHICH IS ALSO MADE BY FANTASY FLIGHT THE GAME ALSO FOLLOWS THE BOOSTER PACK MODEL NO PERSONALLY THATS A BIG CON FOR ME BUT SOME PEOPLE ENJOY OPENING BOOSTERS FINALLY IT IS A CARD AND DICE GAME SO I THINK ITS SAFE TO ASSUME LUCK WILL PLAY A BIGGER ROLE IN OUTCOMES OVER A GAME LIKE
BOTH GAMES ARE EXCELLENT CHOICES AND IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO GO WRONG

DESTINY IS A COLLECTIBLE CARD DICE GAME WHERE YOU BUILD YOUR CHARACTER LIST AND CUSTOMIZE YOUR DECK IT'S MUCH FASTER TO SET UP AND START PLAYING THAN BUT MOST OF THE CONTENT IS DISTRIBUTED AT RANDOM YOU CAN EXPECT TO BUY AT LEAST BOOSTER PACKS BEFORE YOU HAVE A DIVERSE ENOUGH COLLECTION TO START MESSING AROUND WITH YOUR STARTER DECKS ASSUMING YOU BUY BOTH THE REY AND KALO REN STARTERS DICE ARE MUCH MORE CENTRAL TO DESTINY THAN BUT CARDS AND DECK BUILDING ARE ALSO A THING

IS A MINIATURES GAME BASED ON POSITIONING INTUITION AND DARING BOTH PLAYERS GET A FLEET OF SHIPS AND WORK TO OUTFLY THE OTHER SETUP IS RELATIVELY FAST FOR A MINIATURES GAME BUT STILL A GOOD MINUTES LONGER THAN YOU'D TAKE FOR DESTINY THE COMMUNITY FOR IS INCREDIBLY ROBUST AND IT SHOULDN'T BE HARD FOR YOU TO FIND PLAYERS AND SINCE THE EXPANSIONS ARE STATIC IT IS MUCH EASIER FOR YOU TO FIND THE EXACT SHIPS AND UPGRADES YOU WANT TO EXPAND YOUR GAME CARDS ARE A FACTOR BUT LESS SO THAN WITH DESTINY YOU GET POINTS TO SPEND ON VARIOUS PILOTS AND UPGRADES REPRESENTED BY CARDS AND THE DAMAGE DECK IS RANDOMIZED VIA CARD DRAW

IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT DESTINY IS STRUCTURED TO USE A MUCH BROADER CROSS-SECTION OF THE STAR WARS UNIVERSE TAPPING INTO ALL THREE TRILOGIES WHILE IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVE TO THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY ERA BUT SINCE IT'S A NEWER GAME IT HAS FAR LESS CONTENT THAN DOES RIGHT NOW YOU CAN HAVE GENERAL GRIEVOUS FIGHT ALONGSIDE KALO REN ON BOARD THE DEATH STAR BUT IF YOU WANT TO BRING DARTH MAUL INTO THE MIX YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK FOR NOW
I'VE NEVER PLAYED BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO A CCC I HATE ROLLING THE DICE METAPHORICALLY I LOVE ROLLING DICE LITERALLY AND GETTING THE SAME UNNEEDED GARBAGE OVER AND OVER AGAIN CAN BE A RABBIT HOLE BUT IF YOU PLAN AHEAD YOU CAN PRETTY EASILY BUY THE CORE GAME AND A FEW EXPANSIONS FOR A REASONABLE SUM AND HAVE A TON OF FUN WITH IT THERE ARE CARDS IN THE GAME BUT NOT SO MUCH FOR PLAYING IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE THEY INDICATE PLAYER STATS AND WEAPON UPGRADES YOU'RE NEVER HOLDING A HAND OF CARDS IT'S MOSTLY A DICE ROLLING BATTLE GAME WITH TACTICAL MANEUVERING
BOTH YOU NEED BOTH SPEND FOR SHIPS ON MINI MART OR COOLSTUFF PICK UP THE DESTINY BEGINNER DECKS FROM YOUR FAGS
BLOOD BOWL TEAM MANAGER IS A LOT OF FUN NOT SO MUCH NITTY GRITTY PLAY-BY-PLAY BUT MORE PLAYING THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE SEASON
I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR BLOOD BOWL BOTH BB AND BB TEAM MANAGER CARD GAME ARE BOTH STRATEGY BASED BUT RELY A LOT ON LUCK AND DICE ROLLS YOU HAVE TO ENJOY THE WACKINESS AND CHAOS PROVIDED BY DICE ROLLING IF YOU ARE GOING TO APPRECIATE BB YOU SHOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FIND LOCAL PEOPLE TO PLAY BB WITH THAN ANY OF IT'S COMPETITORS DREAD KAOS GUILD BALL BUT YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK WITH YOUR LOCAL STORES TO SEE WHAT IS SUPPORTED MOST I WOULD CHECK TO SEE IF DREAD KAOS ARE STILL ALIVE IF THAT MATTERS TO YOU I DON'T KNOW IF THESE GAMES ARE STILL BEING FULLY SUPPORTED PRODUCED GUILD BALL HAS A 2ND EDITION COMING OUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO YOU MAY WANT TO HOLD OFF ON THAT
PROBABLY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN STRUCTURED LEAGUE PLAY

THAT'S MORE OR LESS THE WHOLE POINT OF BLOOD BOWL I'D SAY GO WITH GUILDHALL AS THE THING I HATE THE MOST ABOUT IT IT'S NEARLY ON RAILS OVERARCHING PROGRESSION DOES ACTUALLY MAKE IT GOOD FOR A SMALLER GROUP TO PLAY IT AT THEIR LEISURE BLOOD BOWL DOES HAVE RULES OUT THERE FOR MORE SIMPLE ONE OFF MATCHES WITH STRONGER TEAMS BUT ACTUALLY PICKING EFFECTIVE TEAMS AND SKILLS IS A DAUNTING TASK

THAT SAID UNLIKE THE OTHER SPORTS BASED GAMES YOU CAN ALWAYS GIVE BLOOD BOWL A WHIRL FOR FREE THANKS TO IT BEING MASSIVE ENOUGH FOR ONLINE IMPLEMENTATIONS TO EXIST SUCH AS THE RETAIL GAME ON STEAM OR THE JAVA BASED FREE FUMBBL

THAT SAID I WILL DOWNPLAY THE ROLE OF DICE IN BB WHILE IT'S TRUE A UTTER DICING CAN BOLLOCKS A GAME A GOOD PLAYER WILL STILL WIN TIMES BECAUSE THE DICE REALLY MAKE IT A GAME ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR OPPONENT IN A POSITION WHERE HE NEEDS TO ROLL A BUNCH OF PERFECT ROLLS IN ORDER TO COME AT YOU WHILE MAKING SURE YOUR ROLLS ARE EITHER OR AS EASY AS POSSIBLE IRONICALLY THE PEOPLE WHO DECRY THE TURNOVER RULE OF BLOOD BOWL DON'T REALIZE IT IS PRECISELY THAT RULE THAT KEEPS IT FROM DEGENERATING INTO A ROLL ALL THE DICE ALL THE TIME TYPE GAME SCREWING UP HURTS AND IT HURTS A LOT BUT WITH SOME SMARTS YOU CAN USUALLY AVOID IT

UNLESS YOU PICK AN OGRE TEAM THEN THE DICE WILL HATE YOU BUT YOU DESERVE IT FOR MAKING A DECISION AS DUMB AS PICKING THE TEAM FULL OF OGRES TO CLARIFY OGRES GOBLINS AND HALFLINGS ARE CONSIDERED THE UTTER JOKE TEAMS THAT ONLY EXIST FOR A LAUGH OR EXPERIENCED VS BOOB HANDICAP AND OGRES ARE CONSIDERED BY FAR TO BE THE WORST OF THE THREE

ALL THAT SAID THOUGH THE ACTUAL COST OF GW MINIATURES IS SO FUCKING HIGH THAT I CAN'T IMAGINE PLAYING IT TABLETOP THESE DAYS TSH AND AS SUCH WOULD STEER YOU TO AFOREMENTIONED DIGITAL ADAPTIONS UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO KITBASH SOME FAKE MODELS OUT OF CARDSTOCK AND SOME BOTTLECAPS ACTUALLY GETTING A BB GROUP GOING FROM SCRATCH FOR SEVERAL PLAYERS IS A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY EVEN IF YOU'RE USING 3RD PARTY FANTASY FOOTBALL WINK WINK NUDGE NUDGE MODELS INSTEAD OF BLOOD BOWL ONES

LASTLY THIS IS AS GOOD A PLACE TO ASK AS ANY I SUPPOSE DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT EVER HAPPENED WITH THAT PRO WRESTLING BOARDGAME FROM A FEW YEARS BACK DID IT EVER ACHIEVE IT'S KICKSTARTER OR MAKE PRODUCTION OR ANYTHING I CAN'T FIND ANY INFO IT EVEN EXISTED SO MAYBE I JUST IMAGINED IT
DREADBALL IS PROBABLY THE BETTER GRID BASED SPORTS STRATEGY GAME THE GAME PLAY WAS CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER THAN OLD BLOOD BOWL AND I DON'T THINK THEY'VE MADE HUGE CHANGES

I'VE JUST PICKED UP THE GUILD BALL KICK OFF SET BUT HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY YET FRIDAY WITH FREE FORM MOVEMENT I'M HOPING FOR A MUCH MORE TACTICAL EXPERIENCE
IT'S A LIVING CARD GAME SO IT'S MEANT TO BE A CONTINUOUS INVESTMENT OF MONEY AND TIME IT IS NOT SOMETHING MEANT TO BE PICKED UP NOW AND THEN BUT TO CONSTANTLY PLAY OVER THE COURSE OF A CAMPAIGN AND BUY THE REGULARLY MONTHLY RELEASED CONTENTION
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER ELDRITCH HORROR
PLAYED ONE GAME OF THE MARKHAM CG AND LIKE IT A LOT THE LORE CARDS AND MECHANICS ARE DESIGNED WELL AND BRING A GREAT UNSETTLING THEME THE CHAOS TOKENS USED FOR SKILL CHECKS IS SMART ALLOWING YOU TO TAILOR THE RISK IN THE GAME TO WHAT YOU WANT A SHAME THERE WAS NO BAG INCLUDED FOR THE CHAOS TOKENS

THE GAME IS GOING TO BE A LOT DEEPER DUE TO THE NATURE OF CARD INTERACTIONS BUT THE RULE SET IS STRAIGHT FORWARD ENOUGH I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO CAMPAIGN PLAY
WILL THE FUTURE EXPANSIONS INCREASE THE PLAYER TO OR OR WILL I ALWAYS NEED TWO CORE SETS
I THINK THE PRINCIPAL THING TO CONSIDER IS TO HAVE DEFUSE LIGHT THAT WAY IT WILL PREVENT GLARE
YES DIFFUSED DAYLIGHT OR BRIGHT WHITE IS BEST FOR BOARDGAMING I'M A BIT TURNED OFF BY DAYLIGHT BALANCED BULBS TO BE HONEST SO I USE BRIGHT WHITE IN MY SPACE WARM OR SOFT WHITE IS TYPICAL FOR TRANSLUCENT BULB COLOUR TEMPERATURE AND THAT'S A BIT TOO ORANGE FOR GAMING

THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IF YOU TRY AND TAKE PHOTOS OF YOUR GAMES OR YOUR GAMING SESSIONS YOU'LL GET MUCH NICER RESULTS UNDER BRIGHT OR DAYLIGHT BULBS IT ALSO HELPS WHEN YOU NEED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PIECES THAT WERE INADVERTENTLY COLOURED A BIT TOO CLOSE TOGETHER
IF YOU CAN HAVE BRIGHTER LIGHTING OVER THE TABLE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE SOME SORT OF HANGING LAMP DIRECTLY OVER THE TABLE WITH SHADES ON IT SO IT DOESN'T SHINE INTO EYES IS GOOD THINK LIGHTING FOR A POOL TABLE OR A POKER GAME
I PREFER SOFTER LIGHTING ALL ROUND THE ROOM BUT A CLEAR LIGHT THATS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE ID LOVE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THE LIGHT FROM A SNOOKER TABLE BUT ITS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME
I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET BUT THERE ARE COUPLE OF VIDEOS DETAILING IT ON YOUTUBE A PLAYTHROUGH AND A RULES OVERVIEW COULD TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF A CLEARER PICTURE

I ALWAYS FEEL THAT GAMES ARE INTERESTING DISTILLATIONS OF REAL PHENOMENA FIRST AND BALANCED GAMES SECOND ONE NEEDS TO ALSO BE INTERESTED IN THE STORIES THE GAMES TELL ALTHOUGH PLAY CAN ALSO BE INTERESTINGLY COMPETITIVE AT TIMES AND BROKENLY UNBALANCED AT OTHERS
PLAYED IT A COUPLE TIMES COOPERATIVELY ANDS LOOK FORWARD TO PLAYING IT SOLO

LIKE ALL OF PHIL DESIGNS HE CHOOSES TO USE THEMATIC TERMS RATHER THAN DESCRIPTIONS OF THE GAME MECHANICS AND THAT MAKES FOR A DENSE READ ALSO HE SPLITS UP RULES BETWEEN THE MAIN BODY AND GLOSSARY WHICH I REALLY DON'T LIKE

SO THE GAME IN A NUTSHELL YOU HAVE 2 COOPERATIVE OR COMPETITIVE DOME PIECES UNTIL YOU GET AN ORGANISM WITH GREEN DOES OR CUBES YOU GET ONLY DOME TO USE

YOU WAIT FOR AN EVENT CARD TO BRING OUT A LOCATION CARD THEN YOU PUT YOU DOME ON IT AND MAYBE DISKS YOU ROLL DICE BASED ON DOMES AND CUBES ON THE TOP BANNER AND IF BY YOURSELF ON A BANNER OF YOUR COLOR YOU CAN REROLL THE ROLLS DETERMINE IN CUBES MOVE FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP TOP TO THE BOTTOM WHICH GETS YOU DISKS IF DISKS GET REMOVED FROM THE CARD AND IF YOUR DOME COMES OFF AND GIVES YOU A DISK BEST OF ALL IF 2 DICE MATCH THEN YOU TAKE THE DOMES AND CUBES FROM THE TOP BANNER DISCARD EVERYTHING ELSE FLIP THE CARD AND PUT IT IN YOUR TABLEAU AND ADD THE BITS YOU TOOK ON THE RIGHT SPOT

NOW YOUR GOAL IS TO BUY CARDS THAT MAKE YOUR BIG CARD BETTER THEY WILL ADD CUBES OF DIFFERENT COLORS BUT SOME OPPONENT CATS CAN ATTACH AND TAKE THOSE CUBES PLUS BUT CARDS OF THEIR OWN AND ONE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ENHANCER CARDS ANOTHER CARD CAN ATTACH TO THEM WHY DO YOU WANT CUBES WITH ENOUGH YOU CAN BUY A CARD TO LAY OVER YOUR BIG CARD AND THE FIRST GUY ATTACHED TO YOU BECOMES PART OF YOU AND THE OTHER GUY ATTACHED TO HIM BECOMES ATTACHED TO YOU NOW YOU CAN EITHER BUT A BLUE CREATURE CARD ADD CUBES TO IT UNTIL FILLED UP THEN FLIP THE CARD OR GO STRAIGHT TO THE FLIP SIDE

I'VE SKIPPED OVER A LOT OF LITTLE DETAILS THINGS LIKE SOME CARDS BOUGHT CAUSE SPIKES AND YOUR GREEN BITS PROTECT YOU FROM THAT THAT YOUR FIRST STAGE OF LIFE MAKES ROLLS WHERE YOU COULD LOSE CUBES BUT YELLOW ALLOWS DICE REROLLS AND BLUE BLOCKS CUBE REMOVAL THAT ADDED CARDS HAVE TONS OF COOL ABILITIES THAT DISKS CAN BE ADDED TO YOUR TABLEAU CARDS TO PROTECT THEM THAT EVENT CARDS HAVE TONS OF SYMBOLS THAT TRIGGER DICE ROLLS AND SO ON

MY POINT IS THAT IT ISN'T REALLY THAT HARD OF A GAME MAYBE I SHOULD START WRITING IN PLAIN ENGLISH GUIDES FOR HIS RULEBOOKS TO HELP PEOPLE LEARN THE MECHANICS INSTEAD OF THE HEMATICS BUT I WILL SAY THE APPEAL OF SIERRA MADRE GAMES ARE THE HEAVY SCIENCE HISTORY THEMES

OVERALL I THINK THIS IS A SOLID COOPERATIVE GAME AND IN THE CATEGORY OF NEANDERTHAL I CAN'T WAIT TO DO A GRAND RUN OF BIOS GENESIS TO BIOS MEGAFAUNA TO ORIGINS HOW WE BECAME HUMAN THEN FOLLOW IT UP WITH A GAME OF HIGH FRONTIER WITH INTERSTELLAR ESSENTIALLY PLAYING THE DAWN OF LIFE IN OUR SYSTEM TO A HYPOTHETICAL FUTURE WHEN LIFE LEAVES SOL TO SPREAD TO OTHER STARS HOWEVER IT IS NOT A GAME FOR EVERYONE AND DIDN'T GET WIDELY DISCUSSED IN GENERAL GAMING FORUMS SMG TITLE FANS ARE AND THIS AKIN TO WARGAMERS MORE THAN BOARDGAMERS
I JUST GOT THE GAME
I DONT HAVE A BIOLOGY BACKGROUND I'M A SYSTEM ENGINEER
I'VE LOOK A VIDEOS ONLINE AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST COMPLICATED GAME THAT I OWN FOR NOW AND I HAVE SOME COMPLICATED GAME IE MAGE KNIGHT FORBIDDEN STARS

I WILL HAVE TO SIT AND READ THE WHOLE THING MULTIPLE TIME I CANT WAIT TO TRY IT THOUGH

HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE ENTERTAINING AND INSTRUCTIVE
THE MANUAL MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT IS I THINK THE NOMENCLATURE AND THE FACT THAT YOUR BITS HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE ON THE PLAYFIELD IS PRETTY DIFFICULT TO PARSE AT TIMES

THIS IS REALLY A GAME WHERE YOU CAN JUST DO THINGS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO AND FIGURE OUT WHY THOSE ARE GOOD OR BAD LATER I'VE HAD MORE SUCCESS IN LEARNING THE RULES BY DOING THAT THAN TRYING TO PARSE THE RULEBOOK

I MAY JUST WORK ON A GOOD PLAYER AID THAT LAYS OUT WHAT YOU DO AT EACH STAGE AND WHAT ALL THE ICONS ALLOW YOU TO DO AND WHEN
DISREGARD ME I'M NOT SURE WHAT GAME I WAS THINKING OF BUT IT'S NOT THIS ONE
GOT MY COPY HAVEN'T GOT TO PLAY IT YET MANUAL IS ANOTHER EKLUND SPECIAL

YOU ONLY NEED THREE WORDS MY FRIEND

MICE AND MYSTICS
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A MINIATURE GAME OR A BOARD GAME WITH MINIATURES BUT I THINK GUILD BALL COULD WORK FOR YOU AND YOUR KIDS THE KICK OFF 2 PLAYER STARTER SET HAS REALLY GOOD VALUE FOR THE PRICE AND THE RULES AREN'T THAT DIFFICULT TO LEARN SO YOUR KIDS SHOULD BE FINE IF YOU'RE PLAYING WITH THEM YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED TO HELP THEM UNTIL THEY LEARN THE RULES BUT I THINK IT'S THE SAME FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERY MINIATURE BASED GAMES

IT HAS SOME VIOLENCE BUT NOTHING TOO SERIOUS AND THE PRESENTATION OF FEMALE CHARACTERS ISN'T SEXIST IF THAT MATTERS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR KIDS IN THE END IT'S ABOUT SOCCER SO FIGHTING ISN'T EVEN NECESSARY FOR WINNING THE GAME

ANOTHER OPTION COULD BE IMPERIAL ASSAULT WHICH HAS CAMPAIGN PLAY AND SKIRMISH BATTLES IN THE SAME BOX IT'S A BIT HEAVIER THAN MICE AND MYSTICS WHICH CHAINMAILTANK SUGGESTED BUT IT IS A LOT BETTER GAME AND YOU'LL GET THE SKIRMISH BATTLES AND MORE MINIATURES TO PAINT
THAT STAR WARS SPACE SHIPS GAME LOOKS GOOD YOU CAN EVEN PERSONALIZE YOUR TEAM WITH COMMANDERS AND STUFF YOUR KIDS WOULD PROBABLY LIKE THAT TOO THE BASE GAME ISN'T THAT EXPENSIVE EITHER


MACHS VS MINIONS
ARCADIA QUEST MIGHT BE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU VERY CUTE CHIBA ART STYLE STRAIGHTFORWARD RULES WITH LOTS OF DICE THROWING MINIATURES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND FUN TO PAINT IT'S A PVPVE GAME IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT

LOVE SEEING LA GANJA ON HERE ONE OF MY FAVORITES
I'M KIND OF SURPRISED NOT TO SEE RACE FOR THE GALAXY ON THERE AT ALL AS SOMEONE WHO LOVES SAN JUAN AND LIKES ROLL I THINK RACE IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE DIFFERENT STROKES I GUESS

I DO REALLY LIKE THE VARIETY AND BOLD CHOICES IN HER LIST OVERALL
EDH BROUGHT ME BACK TO MAGIC TOO

IT EVENTUALLY REACHED THE SAME RESULT AS MOST ARMS RACES NUCLEAR LEVEL WITH EVERYONE BROKE AND MISERABLE
LOVED THIS LIST I LOVE HOW SUZANNE TALKS ABOUT GAMES

I ALSO ENJOYED HOW UNIQUE IT WAS

MY BIGGEST QUESTION DID SHE EXCLUDE ALL BASIC CARD GAMES BESIDES PINOCHLE OR WAS HEARTS OR SPADES NOT IN THE TOP

ALSO I THINK HER COMMENTS ABOUT MAGIC THE GATHERING ARE VERY IMPORTANT IT'S SUCH A HUGE GAME THAT IF YOU FIND THE COMMUNITY POLYSTYLE THAT IS TO YOUR LIKING IT ELEVATES THE GAME TO ANOTHER LEVEL
WHAT IS MAGIC THE GATHERING EDH CASUAL STYLE IS IT NORMAL COMMANDER
GREAT TOP LOOKING FORWARD TO THE TOP BOARD GAME APPS LIST
I'M EXCITED TO SEE GLASS ROAD GETTING THE LOVE IT DESERVES IT'S A FAVOURITE IN ONE OF MY LOCAL GROUPS I'M THE ONE WHO OWNS IT AND IT'S TRULY A PRIVILEGE DEFINITELY MY OF ALL TIME

ALSO PROPS FOR CHOOSING CASTELLATION AS THE UNIVERSE SELECTION IT'S THE BEST OF THE LOT BY SEVERAL MILES BUT I'VE HAD TO WATCH ZEE TURN EVERYONE ONTO THE INFERIOR KNIERIM INSTEAD

IN GENERAL SUZANNE MATCHES MY TASTE NAMELY EUROS THE OBSCURE AND THE BLUEPRINTS AND LONGHORN FOR EXAMPLE ARE BOTH OF THOSE LAST TWO CATEGORIES AND UNTIL SHE LISTED THEM I FIGURED I WAS THE ONLY FAN OF EITHER

OR MAYBE WITH THOSE CLASSIC GAMES IN THERE TOO SHE'S AN AMALGAM OF ME AND MY BOYFRIEND
I'VE PLAYED MAYBE OF THESE KEEPING THIS LIST FOR THE NEXT TIME I GO TO MY LOCAL TABLETOP BAR
GIVEN THE LOVE FOR FIELDS OF ARLE AND PATCHWORK I WONDER IF SUZANNE HAS TRIED A FEAST FOR ODIN YET
NICE TO SEE A LIST THAT DOESN'T STICK TO THE DICE TOWER STANDARD FORMULA
PINOCHLE I DIDN'T REALIZE ANYONE ELSE PLAYED THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STRATEGY GAMES I LEARNED BY WATCHING MY PARENTS PLAY
GREAT LIST SO MANY PICKS THAT I LIKE BUT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY MAKE MY LIST

FUN TO GET A NEW PERSPECTIVE MAKES ME WANT TO TRY GAMES I MAY NOT HAVE GIVEN ENOUGH RESPECT TO
ARLEDROOL
REALLY ENJOYED THESE LISTS HOPE TO SEE MORE OF CONTENT IN THE FUTURE
WHY DOESN'T REVOLUTION GET ON ANY LISTS I THINK THAT GAME IS INCREDIBLE
WHILE IT IS GREAT TO SUPPORT A LOCAL BUSINESS THEY HAVE TO DO THEIR PART YES THEY NEED A LARGER PROFIT MARGIN AND WILL NEED TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO ADD VALUE TO THE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IS BUYING FROM THEM A WORTHWHILE AND FUN EXPERIENCE DO THEY BRING ENOUGH TO THE TABLE

IT'S A HARSH WORLD IN RETAIL WITH AMAZON TAKING EVERYONE'S LUNCH MONEY NOT EVERY SMALL OR LOCAL BUSINESS DESERVES TO SURVIVE
MY LOCAL GAME STORE IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE CITY AND I WILL BUY FROM THEM OCCASIONALLY IT ALL DEPENDS IF THE PRICE DIFFERENCE IS MINIMAL OR THE GAME IS SMALL BOX THEN I DON'T MIND PAYING A BIT MORE FOR EXAMPLE FOR CODENAMES IN MY AGS VS FROM

BUT FOR BIGGER GAMES I'D BE MORE DISCERNING FOR BLOOD RAGE IN STORE VS ONLINE I'M GETTING IT ONLINE NO OR I DON'T PLAY IN THE STORE I DON'T USE THEIR SPACE FOR ANYTHING I JUST GO THERE TO LOOK AT GAMES I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THE STORE AS IT IS HELPFUL FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT NOT ENOUGH TO ADD ONTO AN ALREADY EXPENSIVE GAME

ALSO MY LOCAL STORE NEVER HAS SALES THEY HAVE A CLEARANCE CORNER BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING WORTHWHILE FOR ME IN IT IF SOMETHING IS ON SALE ON AMAZON THEN THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING TO GET IT

BASICALLY I HAVE A TOLERANCE LEVEL DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE THE PRICE IS IF THE DIFFERENCE IS OUTSIDE THAT TOLERANCE LEVEL I BUY IT ONLINE
MY FAGS BOARD GAME BARRISTER NOT ONLY CHARGES MORE THAN ONLINE BUT ALSO MORE THAN THE LSRP YES IF YOU'RE A MEMBER YOU GET POINTS THAT EVENTUALLY AMOUNT TO A DISCOUNT BUT IT STILL DOESN'T BALANCE OUT TO LSRP YOU ALSO HAVE TO USE THESE POINTS IF YOU WANT TO TRY OUT THEIR GAMES IN THE BACK I WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT MY LOCAL STORE BUT THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS HORRIBLE AND NOT CUSTOMER FRIENDLY
SAME THEY ALSO FORGOT THE FRIENDLY BIT
DON'T BUY GAMES THEN IF YOU USE THE SITE THOUGH FEEL FREE TO BUY DRINKS SNACKS DICE COUNTERS ETC
I SUPPORT THE GUARDTOWER IN COLUMBUS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A WIDE SELECTION A CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAM AND HAVE BEEN SINGULARLY THE MOST GBT FRIENDLY PLACE I'VE BEEN WITHOUT MAKING ANY KIND OF FUSS OVER IT I SUPPORT THEM ENOUGH THAT I GENERALLY INCLUDE THEIR NAME WHENEVER I POST ABOUT THEM I DON'T REALLY SUPPORT MY LOCAL STORE BECAUSE IT'S A MTG WARGAMING STORE THEY HAVE REALLY COMPETITIVE PRICES FOR THOSE BUT A REALLY WEAK SELECTION AS THEY SHOULD SEEING AS THEY'RE MOSTLY UNPROFITABLE OF BOXED GAMES THAT ARE MOSTLY THINGS I ALREADY OWN
IT'S KINDA BAD HERE IN HELSINKI AT THE MOMENT IT'S PROBABLY DOWN TO THE FACT THAT THE ONLY EU NATION THAT FINLAND SHARES A LAND BORDER WITH IS SWEDEN AND THAT BORDER IS WAY UP NEAR THE ARCTIC CIRCLE NORWAY ISN'T EU TECHNICALLY BUT ITS BORDER IS ALSO EVEN FURTHER NORTH SO REALISTICALLY IF STUFF IS GOING TO BE SHIPPED TO HELSINKI IT'S EITHER BY PLANE OR BOAT INSTEAD OF ROAD RAIL

THERE'S THREE OPTIONS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE CITY CENTRE TO GO TO A GAME STORE AND PICK UP BOARD GAMES

LAUTAPELIT ACTUALLY A PUBLISHER ECLIPSE AND THE OFFICIAL DISTRIBUTOR OF FFA GAMES IN FINLAND BUT THEY HAVE PHYSICAL STORES TOO THE PRIME SELLING POINT FOR LAUTAPELIT IS THEIR EXTENSIVE CATALOGUE OF BOARD GAMES TAKES UP HALF THE STORE THE OTHER HALF HAS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE VARIETIES THE MARKUP COMPARED TO WHAT I'D EXPECT ONLINE IS MINIMAL BUT THEIR ENGLISH LANGUAGE STOCK IS USUALLY INCOMPLETE I'M AUSTRALIAN AND WORK WITH MANY FOREIGNERS SO ENGLISH VERSIONS ARE FAR MORE PREFERABLE FOR ME

FANTASIAPELIT THEY'RE A MORE GENERAL NERD CULTURE STORE WITH AN EXTENSIVE MANGA SELECTION AS WELL AS TABLETOP WARGAMING BUT THEIR PRICING HAS GONE WRONG LATELY WHEN I FIRST STARTED GOING THERE THE PRICES WERE QUITE REASONABLE BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE A MARKUP MINIMUM ON BOARD GAMES THESE DAYS PANDEMIC LEGACY SELLS FOR AT THE MOMENT EVERY OTHER STORE I'M MENTIONING SELLS IT FOR NO MORE THAN I PREFER WINDOW SHOPPING IN THIS STORE THANKS TO THE RANGE BUT THAT MARK UP WELL IT MAKES IT HARDER TO JUSTIFY BUYING FROM THERE EVEN WITH THEIR YOU SPENT ON OVERPRICED STOCK SO HAVE OFF A PURCHASE CARD REWARD SYSTEM THEY JUST RECENTLY BUMPED NETRUNNER DATAPACKS FROM TO AS WELL WHICH IS CHUMP CHANGE TO BE SURE BUT DOESN'T MAKE ME THINK GOOD THINGS ABOUT PRICE INCREASES AND LAUTAPELIT DON'T KEEP UP TO DATE ON CGS SO I CAN'T PRICE COMPARE THAT WAY

POROMAGIA THEY'RE OUT OF THE CITY CENTRE ONE TRAIN STOP OR THE END OF ONE OF THE TRAM LINES THE PRICES ARE THE BEST IN THE CITY AND THE STOCK IS USUALLY NOT TO SHABBY EITHER BUT I TRY TO AVOID THEM PEOPLE I KNOW THAT ARE HEAVILY INVESTED IN THE BOARD GAME AARP RPG ETC COMMUNITY AROUND HERE TELL SOME INTERESTING STORIES ABOUT HOW THEY DON'T PLAY NICE WITH OTHER BOARD GAME STORES IN FINLAND OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE SCENE THAT I DON'T EVEN TAKE PART IN I PREFER TO TAKE MY MONEY ELSEWHERE

HAS ALSO RECENTLY MADE SHIPPING PRICES MORE REASONABLE I JUST CHECKED PANDEMIC LEGACY AND I CAN GET IT SHIPPED HERE FOR WITH AN EXPECTED SHIPPING TIME OF DAYS

I'VE NOT ACTUALLY ORDERED A BOARD GAME OFF AMAZON EVER I PREORDERED SCYTHE INVADERS FROM AFAR ON BOARD GAME EXTRAS BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT THE MARK UP I CAN CERTAINLY LIVE WITH FOR BIG BOARD GAMES FROM THE LOCAL STORE BUT I'M NOT TOO PLEASED WITH THE MORE EGREGIOUS MARKUPS
WHERE DO YOU PLAY THE GAME IF AT HOME FEEL FREE TO FIND YOUR GAMES ONLINE IF AT THE STORE WITH THE REGULARS OR YOUR FRIENDS OR THAT'S HOW YOU MET THE PEOPLE THAT YOU PLAY GAMES WITH THEN I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST SUPPORTING THE STORE

YES FULL RETAIL PRICING SUCKS SOMETIMES BUT BEING THE RETAILER WHO GETS CONSTANTLY UNDERCUT BY ONLINE RETAILERS SOMETIMES SUCKS MORE THEY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO OFFER THE DISCOUNTS THAT AMAZON DOES EVER
MY AGS BLACK KNIGHT GAMES IS REALLY BAD TOO PANDEMIC IS PANDEMIC LEGACY IS CAVERN


I ORDER FROM ANOTHER GAME SHOP GAMES THAT'S ABOUT MINS AWAY THAT HAS BETTER PRICES AND IS STILL A GAME SHOP THAT HOLDS EVENTS
I TRY TO SUPPORT MY LOCAL STORE BUT THEIR GAMES ARE EUROS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ONLINE STORES AND THEIR SLEEVES ARE ALWAYS OUT OF STOCK I EVEN TRIED WAITING FOR THEIR SLEEVES TO COME ON STOCK AND MADE A COMBINED ORDER OF SLEEVES BUT THEY NEVER FULFILLED IT ANYWAY I JUST OCCASIONALLY BUY SOME PAINTS THERE BUT THAT'S IT
IF YOU USE YOUR FAGS AS THE PLACE TO PLAY BOARD GAMES MEET UP WITH FRIENDS AND GENERALLY HANG OUT THEN YOU SHOULD SUPPORT THEM BY PAYING FOR THEIR OVERPRICED GAMES BECAUSE THEN YOU AREN'T JUST PAYING FOR GAMES YOU'RE PAYING FOR A HANG OUT SPOT YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF NOT HAVING TO HAVE A HOUSE WITH A DEDICATED GAMING AREA

BUT IF YOU OR A FRIEND HOSTS YOUR OWN GAME NIGHTS THEN BY ALL MEANS GO TO AMAZON AND SAVE MONEY SO YOU CAN BUY MORE GAMES
GALAXY TRUCKER FOR AMERICAN DOLLARS PLUS TAX

SO YEAH IT'S LESS OF A STORE AND MORE OF A CLUBHOUSE
I JUST DON'T SEE THE REASON FOR EXISTENCE FOR MANY FAGS ANYMORE

PRICES ARE SUPER EXPENSIVE AND THE OFFER IS ALWAYS OUT OF DATE EXPENSIVE WRONG LANGUAGE WHATEVER

MANY OF THEM ARE BETTER OFF AS A BOARDGAME CAFE I THINK SCRAP LOTS OF THE INVENTORY AND PROVIDE BETTER PLACE FOR SITTING DOWN TO GAME SURE HAVE SOME COMMON STUFF IN STOCK LIKE THE LATEST MAGIC SETS SOME PARTY GAMES AND POPULAR GATEWAY TITLES THAT YOU SELL TO PEOPLE JUST COMING IN BUT AT SOME FAGS I SEE RD OF THE SPACE USED FOR GAMERS GAMES LIKE GAME OF THRONES BG AND THE LIKE AND I JUST WONDER WHY PRICES ON THEM ARE WORSE THAN ONLINE PEOPLE DON'T RANDOMLY BUY THESE WHEN COMING INTO THE STORE AND THEY OFTEN EVEN SCARE AWAY
MY LOCAL FAGS SELLS FOR LSRP SO NOT MUCH IS BOUGHT THERE

THE ONE PLACE WHERE THEY SHINE GREATLY THOUGH IS THINGS THAT ARE OUT OF PRINTING I HAVE PICKED UP GEARS OF WAR FOR AND THEY STILL HAVE A COPY VITICULTURE EE WHICH IS OOS ON THE ONLINE SITES I CHECK AND SNOWDONIA WHICH IS ALSO OOS ONLINE

MAYBE THE GENERAL GAMES ARE TOO MUCH BUT THERE MAY BE A DIAMOND HIDING THERE AS WELL
ARE THEY SELLING HIGHER THAN LSRP I WOULDN'T EVER BUY A GAME PRICED LIKE THAT UNLESS IT WAS OUT OF PRINT OR FOR A CHARITY AUCTION OR SOMETHING

IF THEY'RE SELLING AT LSRP THAT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL AMAZON ROUTINELY CHARGES LESS THAN LSRP SO YOU CAN GET SOME BIG DISCREPANCIES ON HIGH-PRICED GAMES FOR INSTANCE FORBIDDEN STARS IS STANDARD RETAIL PRICE AT MY AGS BUT ON AMAZON

ULTIMATELY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REASON FOR BUYING FROM THE STORE INSTEAD OF ONLINE THEY'RE NOT A CHARITY DO YOU OFTEN GO THERE TO PLAY GAMES OR TOURNAMENTS FOR GAMES DO THEY PROVIDE A SERVICE THAT YOU WANT TO SUPPORT
GUESS I'M LUCKY THE PRICES AT MY FAGS WHICH DOUBLES AS A TOY STORE ARE OFTEN COMPARABLE TO ONLINE PRICES ON TOP OF THAT IF YOU HAVE A CUSTOMER CARD YOU GET A DISCOUNT ON ALL GAMING RELATED PURCHASES I'VE RARELY IF EVER PAID MORE THAN WHAT I WOULD PAY ONLINE EVEN IF THE PRICE WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT I'D PAY ONLINE I'D STILL PREFER TO BUY AT THE GAME STORE TO SHOW MY SUPPORT

IN YOUR SITUATION WITH PRICES BEING DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT I WOULD APPROACH THE OWNER MANAGER OF THE STORE AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT TELL THEM THAT YOU'D GLADLY SUPPORT THE STORE IF PRICES WEREN'T SO HIGH COMPARED TO ONLINE
EVER SINCE THE FAGS HERE STOPPED ORGANIZING EVENTS I BOUGHT A LOT LESS GAMES THERE

ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE PEOPLE WORKING THERE ARE GREAT THEY BECAME JUST ANOTHER STORE
THANKFULLY MY PRIMARY FAGS USUALLY SPORTS THE BEST PRICES I CAN GET IN ONTARIO CANADA
YUP IT SUCKS

I WANT TO SUPPORT THEM BUT DANG I AIN'T RICHARD

IT'S TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WON'T EVEN HELP ME BUY MINIATURE PAINTING SUPPLIES UNLESS I'M BUYING IT AT THE STORE
MY REASON ARE NOT THE PRICES BUT THE FACT THAT NEW GAMES TAKE OOOO LONG TO HIT THEIR SHELVES
IF I SPEND A DAY AT MY LOCAL STORE PLAYING I'LL BUY DRINKS THERE AND MAKE SURE TO PICK UP AT LEAST A SMALL BOOK OR GAME I JUST CONSIDER IT PART OF THE PRICE TO KEEP THEY PLACE OPERATING

I STILL BUY STUFF ONLINE AS WELL
THINK OF IT AS PAYING RENT INSTEAD OF MARKUP IF YOU USE THEIR SPACE AND TIME PAY THE RENT

YOU CAN CHOOSE WHERE TO BUY YOUR STUFF STILL BUT REALIZE THAT PAYING EMPLOYEES KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON AND STUFF LIKE THAT COSTS THEM MONEY ALSO REALIZE THAT BUYING A BAG OF CHIPS AND A SODA EVERY TIME YOU GO IN DOESN'T PAY THE RENT FOR 2 HOURS OF SITTING THERE IS VERY MINIMAL

HAVE YOU TRIED TALKING TO THEM ABOUT IT IN A NICE WAY THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A GIANT DISCOUNT A LOT OF TIMES THEY ARE ALL TOO AWARE BUT MY STORE DOES A OFF IF YOU SPECIAL ORDER FROM THEM THEY CANNOT MATCH AMAZON IN THIS RESPECT STILL BUT THEY'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO BUY IT FROM THEM THEY'LL ALSO DO SOMETHING LIKE TEAM COVENANTS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE TO CGS SO THEY DON'T HAVE PRODUCT LINGERING ON THE SHELF TAKING UP VALUABLE OTHER SPACE

AS SOME OTHER POSTERS SAID THEY HAVE TO DO THEIR PART TOO BUT IF YOU USE IT AS A GATHERING OR PLAY SPACE DO YOURS ALSO
IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM MOST THINGS ARE CHEAPER ONLINE THESE DAYS BECAUSE THEY'RE SOLD BY HUGE COMPANIES WHO CAN BUY TONS OF COPIES AT WHOLESALE PRICES AND TURN THEM AROUND AT A LOWER MARGIN JUST DUE TO THE SHEER VOLUME OF SALES

DON'T LET PEOPLE GUILT YOU INTO SHOPPING LOCAL IF YOU DON'T FEEL THE CONVICTION YOURSELF THERE ARE SOME FOLKS WHO BLINDLY ADVOCATE FOR THE LOCAL OPTION BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR TO THE BUSINESSES OR THE CONSUMER IF MY LOCAL STORE OVERPRICES EVERYTHING AND TREATS ME POORLY I'M EXPECTED TO TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE

DO CONSIDER THE VALUE OF WHAT YOU GET FROM YOUR LOCAL STORE APART FROM MERELY THE PRICE OF THE INVENTORY THOUGH IT COSTS ME MORE TO GET GAMES LOCALLY NEARLY OF THE TIME HOWEVER I REALLY VALUE THE ABILITY TO GO TO THE STORE AND BROWSE SHELVES OF COOL STUFF IF EVERYBODY SHOPPED ONLINE BRICK AND MORTAR STORES WOULDN'T EXIST SO I BUY OF MY GAMES JUST TO KEEP SHOPPING FOR GAMES INTACT THAT MAY NOT BE IMPORTANT TO YOU BUT IT IS TO ME ALSO CONSIDER HOW MUCH YOU VALUE THEIR SERVICE PLAY TABLES IF APPLICABLE ETC WHATEVER YOU GET OUT OF THE STORE HOLD IT UP AGAINST THE LOWER AMAZON PRICE AND ASK YOURSELF WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU

IF ALL YOU VALUE IS A LOW PRICE AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH ONLINE SALES
AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED IN THIS THREAD YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT LOCAL GAME STORES THAT DO NOTHING TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT YOU AS A CONSUMER OBVIOUSLY IT'S YOUR MONEY AND YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT BUT IF YOUR BRICK AND MORTAR GAME STORE HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE THE PRICE OF ONLINE RETAILERS I WOULD RECOMMEND JUST BUYING ONLINE BUSINESS AND MAXIMIZING YOUR DOLLAR VALUE ALWAYS COMES FIRST
YEAH THIS COMES UP A LOT IN THE MAGIC THE GATHERING COMMUNITY AND BOARD GAMES

CURRENTLY IN MANY US STORES I THINK VERY FEW THOUGH I WILL BE CORRECTED I'M SURE IN MY AREA IN MA MAKE MONEY VIA BOARD GAMING ALONE IN FACT I'D VENTURE THAT MAGIC AND OTHER CCC CGS MAKE THEM A LOT MORE MONEY THAN BOARD GAMES

WHILE I LOVE MY AGS AND DO BUY CARDS THERE I WILL DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE AND THAT LINE IS OFTEN WITH BOARD GAMES MANY LASS SELL AT OR ABOVE LSRP WHERE I AM

I ASKED THE ONCE AND HE CLAIMED THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE ORDER WAS SO SMALL AND THAT THEY CHARGED SHIPPING ETC THAT THE PRICE FOR A PARTICULAR SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE EXPANSION HAD TO BE ALMOST US ABOVE LSRP THAT'S ABSURD I TOLD HIM HONESTLY IT WAS TOO MUCH

AT ANY RATE THE BIGGEST VOTE YOU MAKE IS WITH YOUR WALLET I BUY MTG CARDS FROM MY AGS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE PRICES ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IF I WENT ONLINE WE'RE TALKING BY ON CARDS I DO VALUE THAT THEY RUN TOURNAMENTS AND ACTUALLY SUPPORT THAT COMMUNITY

I DO NOT THINK THEY ADD VALUE TO THE BOARD GAMING COMMUNITY BECAUSE THEY DON'T PROMOTE IT OR PROVIDE AS MUCH SUPPORT WE HAD MORE SUPPORT FROM THE MALL FOOD COURT WHEN WE USED TO PLAY BOARD GAMES THERE THAN THE AGS THAT'S KIND OF SAD WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT I WAS SADDER WHEN THAT FOOD COURT CLOSED DOWN THAN I WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR ALMOST ANY STORE I PLAYED BOARD GAMES AT IN THE CONTEXT OF BOARD GAMING

EDIT

SO THE PROBLEM I THINK IS THAT IN THE END THERE'S LITTLE TO NO SUPPORT FOR MANY BOARD GAMING GROUPS AND SINCE THEY'RE GENERALLY PREYING ON IMMEDIACY THERE'S LITTLE REASON TO COMPETE IF FEW BOARD GAMERS ARE COMING IN PEOPLE EVEN BUY AND WARMACHINE MINIATURES AT THE LASS I GO TO EVEN THOUGH ONLINE DOES HAVE IT FOR CHEAPER IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITY AND THEY LIKE GOING TO THE AGS
SAME BOAT OUR FAGS CLUB SELLS BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL BUT IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE BY A WHOLE DAILY WORTH OF MONEY THAN GETTING A NEW ONE FROM EBAY WITH SHIPPING SO I'M RELUCTANT TO BUY IT AT ALL BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO THE STORE OWNER
I WASN'T A FAN OF THE SPECIAL SCENARIO EITHER BUT I LIKE RAXXON ADDED TO THE STANDARD SCENARIOS THE MUTANT ZOMBIES MIX THINGS UP
I HAVE ALSO ONLY PLAYED WITH THE MODULE ONCE BUT MY EXPERIENCE WAS VERY DIFFERENT WE LOCKED DOWN RAXXON EARLY ON AND NEVER LET A SINGLE SPECIAL ZOMBIE ESCAPE WE ALSO RAIDED THAT ITEM DECK AND GOT ALL SORTS OF CRAZY POWERFUL STUFF IT WAS GOOD TIMES
DELETED
I DON'T THINK THE SCENARIOS ARE THAT GREAT

FROM A RAXXON PERSPECTIVE UNLESS THE GAME IS LONG I'M NOT SURE LOCKING RAXXON IS WORTH IT IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE TO DO 2 SPECIFIC DICE AND A CHARACTER HAS TO BE THERE
TO ME THE EPITOME OF CREATE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE IS TALES OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ENTIRE GAME IS A STORY UNFOLDING AS YOU TRAVEL AROUND AND MAKE DECISIONS VERY FUN FOR A GROUP ALTHOUGH IT ISN'T CO-OP SO I'M NOT SURE IF FITS YOUR WORKING TOGETHER TO SOLVE A PROBLEM REQUEST EVEN THOUGH IT IS TECHNICALLY COMPETITIVE TO ME THE GAME PLAYS MORE OR LESS COOPERATIVELY STILL B C OF THE SHARING OF STORIES
COULD TRY ONE OF THE ESCAPE ROOM BOARD GAMES IF WANT TO DO TEAMS COULD BUY 2 COPIES AND RACE


ROBINSON CRUSOE ADVENTURES ON THE CURSED ISLAND IS AMONG THE BEST COOPERATIVE GAMES OUT THERE IT'S NOT AS MUCH A CREATE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE BUT IT'S A VERY ROBUST TEAM GAME
TRY SOME SORT OF ONE-SHOT RPG LIKE DREAD YOU WOULD NEED TO MODERATE THE GAME FOR THE OTHER GUESTS
IF YOU'RE AT ALL INTO ROLE PLAYING YOU COULD PROBABLY TURN AVALON INTO A GAME FOR THE EVENING MAKE STORIES DEPENDING ON THE RESULTS OF THE CARDS THAT COME UP

POOR EXAMPLE OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD EXCUSE THE GRAMMAR LOL

NARRATOR KING ARTHUR SUMMONED ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH OF HIS MAJOR KINGDOMS IN SEARCH OF THE HOLY GRAIL BUT HIS MORDRED GOT SOME OF HIS MINIONS INTO THE MIX

HIS RIGHT HAND MAN MERLIN WHO IS IN DISGUISE IS ABLE TO SEE THE TRUE INTENTIONS OF EACH OF THE REPRESENTATIVES BUT CANNOT REVEAL WHO THEY ARE TO ARTHUR IN FEAR OF BEING KILLED BY THE MINIONS OF MORDRED IS PRESENT AT THE ROUND TABLE

BLAH BLAH BLAH INTRODUCE ALL OF THE SPECIAL CHARACTERS

TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THE ROUND TABLE IS TRUST WORTHY KING ARTHUR HAS SET QUESTS FOR THE REPRESENTATIVES TO GO ON SHOULD THEY PASS OF THE WITHOUT MERLIN REVEALING HIMSELF THE ROUND TABLE SUCCEEDS AND CAN GO ON TO FIND THE HOLY GRAIL

THE FIRST QUEST REQUIRES 2 REPRESENTATIVES TO GO FIND A RUBY FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHERN

MARK I AM BEST SUITED FOR THIS QUEST I'M FROM THE MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTH AND KNOW THEM LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND

ALICE I AM ALSO SUITED FOR THIS I AM A GEOLOGIST AND KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE RUBY'S ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE

ETC ETC

IF THE QUEST FAILS

MARK I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES THAT ALICE DESTROYED THE RUBY'S WHENEVER WE FOUND ONE

ALICE NO MARK GOT US LOST AND TOOK US FOR A ROUND ABOUT THE MOUNTAINS WE NEVER EVEN GOT TO SEE A SINGLE RUBY

ETC ETC
A COUPLE QUICK SUGGESTIONS

BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL

THE RESISTANCE

PANDEMIC

FORBIDDEN DESERT

U GETINFO
TWO ROOMS AND A BOOM WAS PRACTICALLY DESIGNED FOR MINGLING OVER DRINKS

NOT MY FAVORITE GAME BUT IT GETS PEOPLE TALKING OR IN SMALL GROUPS AND FORCES INTERACTION IN A MORE CONSTRUCTIVE WAY THAN SIMILAR GAMES LIKE RESISTANCE YOU CAN SLOW DOWN THE TIMER TO ALLOW MORE MINGLING IF THAT WORKS FOR YOUR GROUP
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE
YOU NEED
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU LOOK AT THESE ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU LIKE TI
POLIS FIGHT FOR THE HEGEMONY
WIR SIND DAS VOLK
SEKIGAHARA


MAYBE COMBAT COMMANDER EUROPE IF YOU WOULD WANT TO TRY A WARGAME

ALSO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THE UPCOMING RELEASES KICKSTARTERS OF
COLONIAL TWILIGHT
HANNIBAL ROME VS CARTHAGE
IMPERIAL STRUGGLE
IF YOU WANT SOME SMALLER TWO PLAYER GAMES SAMURAI IS A SUPER TIGHT TWO PLAYER GAME PATCHWORK IS GREAT MR JACK CAN GET REALLY INTERESTING THESE GAMES ARE AT THE MOST MINUTE GAMES BUT THEY ARE ALL REALLY TIGHT AND YOU CAN HAVE SOME GREAT COMPETITION PLAYING THEM ALSO SOMETHING LIKE ECLIPSE CAN BE ENJOYED AS A TWO PLAYER AND IS GREAT IF OTHERS SHOW UP
BATTLETOWN DEVASTATION OF INDENES IS A GREAT GAME THAT BRINGS OLD 2D FIGHTERS TO THE TABLE AND DOES SO REALLY WELL THIS IS A GAME THAT REWARDS TWO PLAYERS BEING WILLING TO DIVE INTO IT TOGETHER DEVASTATION COMES WITH VASTLY DIFFERENT FIGHTERS OF VARYING COMPLEXITIES FOR YOU TO GET LOST IN IF YOU REALLY GET INTO IT THERE IS A LOT OF DEPTH THERE

STAR WARS IMPERIAL ASSAULT HAS A SKIRMISH MODE THAT IS REALLY INTRIGUING IT REALLY REWARDS HAVING AS MUCH OF THE GAME AS POSSIBLE BUT THERE'S A DECENT AMOUNT OF VARIATION WITH JUST THE CORE GAME I DISAGREE WITH THE REVIEWER ABOUT CAMPAIGN MODE AS I FIND A LOT OF ENJOYMENT WITH IT I'M CURRENTLY PLAYING TWO CAMPAIGNS ON BG CURRENTLY

TWILIGHT STRUGGLE IS HERALDED AS ONE OF THE BEST TWO PLAYER GAMES AND IS ANOTHER GAME THAT REWARDS TWO PLAYERS WILLING TO LEARN IT TOGETHER I'VE NEVER PLAYED IT BUT WOULD LIKE TO ONE DAY

ANDROID NETRUNNER IS A GREAT ASYMMETRICAL 2 PLAYER GAME THAT LIKE IMPERIAL ASSAULT CAN BE A BIT OF YOU CAN GET A DECENT VALUE OUT OF ONE CORE SET ESPECIALLY IF FOUND AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE LIKE I FOUND IT BUT YOU'LL DEFINITELY WANT BETTER CARDS IF YOU WANT TO BUILD BETTER DECKS BUT THE CORE SET COMES WITH CORPORATION AND RUNNER STARTER DECKS WHICH SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT

THE REVIEWS LINKED HERE ARE LARGELY POSITIVE AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY DISSENTING OPINIONS ON ALL OF THESE GAMES SOMEWHERE DEFINITELY RESEARCH THEM MORE WITH YOUR FRIEND IF ABLE BEFORE DECIDING TO PURCHASE ANYTHING

HAPPY GAMING
LE HAVRE FIELDS OF ARLE AND TWILIGHT STRUGGLE MIGHT BE GOOD ONES TO CHECK OUT
HERE'S SOME SHORTER PLAY TIME SUGGESTIONS

RACE FOR THE GALAXY IS A GREAT AT TWO PLAYER AND HIGHER COUNTS

BATTLE LINE IS A VERY CLEVER 2 PLAYER

ANDROID NETRUNNER HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IT'S A VERY DEEP GAME DECK BUILDING

STAR WARS REBELLION VERY GOOD TWO PERSON GAME OF WAR AND HIDE AND SEEK
QUEEN GAMES HAS A SALE GOING ON AMAZON CURRENTLY BUT YES THE SALES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN BLACK FRIDAY AND CYBER MONDAY HYPE HAS SUPERSEDED THE ACTUAL DEALS
B N HAS HAD SOME DEALS BF UNTIL YESTERDAY THEY HAD BOARD GAMES BUY GET HALF OFF THAT YOU COULD COMBINE WITH A OFF ONE ITEM WHICH BASICALLY AMOUNTED TO OFF ANY TWO GAMES YOU COULD FIND ON THEIR SHELVES TODAY THEY HAVE OFF EVERYTHING OFF ONE GAME WHICH IS AGAIN ESSENTIALLY OFF ANY ONE GAME B N TYPICALLY STARTS WITH PRICES ABOVE LOGS AMAZON SO THIS IS MORE LIKE OFF IN BOTH CASES BUT STILL

BLACK FRIDAY I GOT KINGDOM BUILDER FOR BY COMBINING A DISCOVER CARD DEAL WITH AMAZON'S QUEEN GAMES SALE

SO YEAH THERE HAVE BEEN DEALS OUT THERE ESPECIALLY IF YOU COUNT THE DEALS AMAZON AND TARGET RAN BEFORE BLACK FRIDAY IT HASN'T BEEN SPECTACULAR OR OVERWHELMING BUT THERE HAVE BEEN DEALS
THE BUY 2 GET FREE DEALS FROM A MONTH AGO ON AMAZON WERE A BIT MORE IMPRESSIVE BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME GOOD DEALS TO BE FOUNDATION WE'RE STILL OPTIMISTIC THAT MORE DEALS WILL PEAK THEIR HEADS OUT

TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM HERE
ARTICLES
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW

HONESTLY THIS TIME OF YEAR IT WAS PROBABLY JUST EASIER AND CHEAPER TO JUST SEND THEM OFF WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION FOR PAWNS IT KEEPS THE CUSTOMER HAPPY AND COSTS THEM CENTS
I'VE CONTACTED SEVERAL COMPANIES ABOUT MISSING OR DAMAGED COMPONENTS AND NEVER BEEN ASKED FOR DOCUMENTATION BUT MAYFAIR ISN'T ONE OF THEM SO IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THEY TREAT CUSTOMERS RIGHT TOO
BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME IS POINTLESS JUST GOING THROUGH EMPTY MOTIONS
EXPLODING KITTENS
EVOLUTION JUST BORED OUT OF MY MIND
PLENTY RECENTLY IT WAS CLASH OF CULTURES TOO LONG AND NOT THAT INTERESTING
RA THE DICE GAME FOR ME I WAS BORED OUT OF MY SKULL FOR MOST OF THE GAME
KYTHE THE GIMMICK WORE OFF QUICKLY AND THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF GAME TIME LEFT THERE AREN'T MANY GAMES I'M UNWILLING TO PLAY AGAIN KYTHE IS ONE OF THE CLOSEST
LA ISLA I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I REALLY DIDN'T ENJOY IT
OH MAN YEAH WE DIDN'T EVEN FINISH A ROUND OF DEAD LAST ASIDE FROM THAT I'M REALLY BAD AT REMEMBERING THE GAMES I DON'T LIKE
QUITE A FEW I'LL JUST LIST FOUR OR FIVE HERE IT'S KIND OF A BAD HABIT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU CAN'T GET A PROPER APPRECIATION FOR THE NUANCES OF A GAME WITH ONLY A SINGLE PLAY HOWEVER THE ONES I'VE DISCOUNTED WERE GAMES THAT I PLAYED AND THEN CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT EVEN IF IT HAD SUBTLE NUANCES FROM GAME TO GAME IT STILL WOULDN'T BE A GAME I'D BE INTERESTED IN

ALCHEMISTS WHILE I ENJOYED THE PUZZLE OF DEDUCTION USING THE APP AND THE CROSS-REFERENCE CHART THE WORKER PLACEMENT PORTION OF THE GAME KIND OF BORED ME AND SINCE THAT'S A BIG PORTION OF THE GAME I DECIDED TO LET ALCHEMISTS GO IN A TRADE I ABSOLUTELY THINK IT'S A GAME WORTH TRYING BUT ONCE WAS ENOUGH OF AN EXPERIENCE FOR ME
IMPERIAL SETTLERS NOT A BAD GAME BUT IT'S A LITTLE TOO COMBATIVE FOR MY TASTE I DON'T MIND INTERACTIVITY IN GAMES BUT I PREFER WHEN IT'S LESS DESTRUCTIVE I PLAYED IT ONCE WITH MY WIFE AND DECIDED IT WASN'T FOR ME
CACAO IT'S A CLEVER GAME BUT I WASN'T ENGAGED WITH THE PUZZLE ESSENTIALLY IT'S A MULTIPLIER PUZZLE WHERE AND HOW DO I POSITION THIS TILE TO MAXIMIZE WHAT I NEED WHAT FRUSTRATED ME ABOUT IT WAS THAT I WANTED MORE MORE VARIETY AND MORE CHALLENGE I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD MAKE FOR A POPULAR GAME BUT IT WOULD MAKE FOR A GAME THAT I PREFER CACAO WASN'T BAD BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR ME
DEAD OF WINTER AS A FAN OF ZOMBIES YES I SAID IT I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A GAME THAT SEEMED TO TAKE A MORE EURO APPROACH TO THE GENRE DEAD OF WINTER SEEMED TO HAVE SOME EURO SENSIBILITIES AND IT DOES THE PROBLEM IS THEY'RE OVERSHADOWED BY AN AMERITRASH SENSIBILITY THAT I DIDN'T CARE FOR A HIGHLY DETERMINISTIC DIE THAT CAN BASICALLY RESET YOUR GAME EVERY TURN IF YOU AREN'T CAREFUL WASN'T CREATING FUZZY FEELINGS
DOMINION WELL NOT REALLY I'VE ACTUALLY PLAYED MAYBE A DOZEN GAMES OF DOMINION BUT NONE OF THEM WERE EVER AS GOOD AS THAT FIRST ONE WITH THE BASE SET BEYOND THAT THE NOVELTY OF THE GAME KIND OF DIMINISHED AND I WAS NEVER SATISFIED WITH SUBSEQUENT PLAYS OF IT DESPITE OWNING A COUPLE OF THE EXPANSIONS I TRADED IT ALL AWAY

MAN BITES DOG A GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE A NEWS HEADLINE FROM A HAND OF CARDS THE DISTRIBUTION OF POINTS ON THE CARDS SEEMS COMPLETELY RANDOM WITH THE WALL ST CARD SCORING POINTS FOR SOME REASON EVERYONE WHO HAS MADE A SENTENCE THAT MAKES SOME SENSE SCORES POINTS THIS GAME JUST BORES ME TO DEATH
TRAGEDY LOOPER HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WHEN A GUY WHO CAME TO OUR LOCAL NEETUP BROUGHT IT AND TALKED DOWN TO US WHEN WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE MYSTERY BEYOND THAT IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF TRIAL-AND-ERROR WHICH FEELS CLUNKY AS FAR AS SOCIAL DEDUCTION MYSTERY GAMES GO
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT FOR ME THE MOST NOTABLE ARE ONES THAT ARE GENERALLY ENJOYED BY OTHER PEOPLE IN THE HOBBY

COSMIC ENCOUNTERS

BLOOD RAGE

FIVE TRIBES

HANAFI

ALCHEMISTS
MUNCHKIN
FLUX
CHUNKY FIGHTERS
KILLER BUNNIES
GOLD DIGGER
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY
WE DIDN'T PLATIEST THIS AT ALL
MILLE BARNES
BOSS MONSTER
SO SO MANY


ORLEANS
CAUTION PRODUCT INFORMATION SAYS IT IS IN POLISH BUT THE ONLY REVIEW IS IN ENGLISH
YOU CAN GET ALHAMBRA BIG BOX FROM AMAZON FOR ALMOST OFF
FOR ANYONE WHO IS WONDERING I GOT MY COPY AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE IN FACT ENGLISH SO IT'S VERY PLAYABLE THE TILES DO NOT HAVE TEXT BUT THE CURRENCY BOARD HOUSING THE TILES DOES THEY SIMPLY STATE THE REGIONAL CURRENCY NAME
YOU CAN PLAY A BARD IN DESCENT
WELCOME BACK TO THE DUNGEON HAS A BARD IN IT ALTHOUGH I DOUBT IT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
I'M PRETTY SURE BARD IS ONE OF THE AVAILABLE PROFESSIONS IN GUILDHALL
THERE'S ONE IN THE WITCHER ADVENTURE GAME ALTHOUGH THE GAME ITSELF IS NOT PARTICULARLY GREAT
IN TALES OF OLD EXPANSION FOR DARKEST NIGHT HAS A BARD LUTE AND EVERYTHING IT'S A CO-OP GAME WHERE YOU TRY TO DEFEAT AN EVIL NECROMANCER WITH A GROUP OF FOUR HEROES AS YOU'D EXPECT BARD IS A NICE SUPPORT HERO WHO ROCKS HIS LUTE FOR VARIOUS BUFFS

2ND EDITION KICKSTARTER SUPPOSED TO SHIP MARCH AND HAS EXPANSION HEROES INCLUDED NO IDEA ABOUT RETAIL RELEASE DATE
YOU DON'T GET TO PLAY THEM BUT YOU DO GET TO FIGHT STINKING BARDS IN DUNGEON LORDS

AND ON THE SUBJECT OF VLADA I THINK THERE'S A BARD CLASS IN PROPHECY BUT I'M NOT SURE ON THAT ONE
PATHFINDER ADVENTURE CARD GAME HAS A BARD PACK WITH DIFFERENT BARDS IN IT THAT YOU CAN PLAY

ORDER OF THE STICK GAME HAS A BARD AS ONE OF THE CHARACTERS THE GAME IS PRETTY BAD BUT THE BARD IN THE WEBCOMIC IS VERY FUNNY
DUNGEON FIGHTER HAS A BARD CHARACTER TO PLAY AS IT'S WHAT I PICK
EVEN IF THE GAME ISN'T POPULAR ON HERE THERE IS A BARD CLASS IN MUNCHKIN
SO I HAVE HOGWARTS BATTLE LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN AND BIG BOOK OF MADNESS MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT HOGWARTS BATTLE IS TRUE WE ABSOLUTELY ADORE AND LOVE HARRY POTTER BUT WE ARE ALSO EXPERIENCED GAMERS WHO DID FIND THE GAME A BIT DULL OUR COPY OF LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN HAS YET TO HIT THE TABLE BUT BIG BOOK OF MADNESS IS WHERE IT'S AT FOR ME I AM A PROPONENT OF SO WHEN I LOOK AT CO-OP GAMES I MOSTLY CONSIDER THE DOWNTIME PARTICIPATION AND ALL THE ASPECTS THAT MAKE IT CO-OP THE HARRY POTTER DECK BUILDER LEANS ITSELF MORE TOWARDS EVERYBODY KINDA JUST DOING THEIR OWN THING FOR A COMMON GOAL MOST OF THE CO-OP IN THAT GAME COMES WHEN YOU PLAY A CARD AND SAY HEY I CAN GIVE ONE OF YOU A COIN ATTACK TOKEN HEAL AND THE OCCASIONAL I THINK WE NEED TO GET RID OF THIS VILLAIN FIRST BECAUSE BLAH BLAH BLAH BUT BCOM HAS ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF DECK BUILDING AND THAT I ENJOY ON TURN YOU ARE CONSTANTLY ALL SOLVING THIS PUZZLE TOGETHER HOW CAN YOU OPTIMIZE THE TURN SO YOU DON'T ALL GET HAMMERED WITH THE PENALTIES OF A CURSE CAN YOU STEAMROLL THIS MONSTER TO GET THE REWARD FOR NOT TRIGGERING ANY CURSES WHAT MONSTER IS COMING UP DO WE HAVE ENOUGH OF A CERTAIN ELEMENT IN OUR DECK TO HANDLE IT AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE EPIPHANY YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE ALL DOWN ON YOUR LUCK TRYING TO SOLVE A TURN WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NO HOPE AND THEN IT JUST CLICKS AND YOU SAY HEY IF YOU PLAY THIS SPELL TO MAKE HIM DO THIS HE CAN TAP THAT SPELL AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE FINISHES YOUR SENTENCE AND SAYS YES I SEE IT THAT'LL MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND WE BANISH THIS MONSTER AND WIN THE GAME ONE BIG CON TO THIS GAME THOUGH IS THAT IT CAN FAIR ITSELF TO PIGGYBACKING VERY EASILY LIKE IN PANDEMIC WHERE ONE PLAYER REALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT IF THAT PLAYER IS AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S JUST A GAME AND TRIES TO MAKE IT ENJOYABLE FOR EVERYONE IT SHOULD GO SMOOTHLY AS IT TURNS OUT THAT PIGGYBACKED TURNED OUT TO BE ME SO I LEARNED A LOT FROM THAT
WITH GAMES LIKE THIS I PERSONALLY THINK THEME IS OF DECISION YOU NEED TO LOVE HARRY POTTER TO LOVE THE HOGWARTS BATTLE GAME IF YOU AREN'T A FAN OF THE POTTER SERIES THE GAME IS ABSOLUTELY DULL BUT FOR MY WIFE WHO LOVES THE BOOKS IT'S A BLAST BECAUSE OF THE CARD FLAVOUR THE ARTWORK THE SPELL AND CHARACTER NAMES THAT ARE ALL FIRST NATURE TO HERALDRY FOR ME I WILL HAPPILY SUFFER THROUGH IT FOR HER ENJOYMENT BUT I'D NEVER WANT TO PLAY IT OTHERWISE

NEITHER OF US LIKE SUPERHERO THEMES AT ALL SO I WOULD NEVER TOUCH THE MARVEL STUFF WITH A POLE
I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TELESTRATIONS IT'S EASY PRODUCES GREAT LAUGHS AND COMES IN A PARTY PACK THAT PLAYS UP TO THOUGH IT CAN ACCOMMODATE ANY NUMBER BELOW THAT I RECENTLY PLAYED THAT WITH A DEMOGRAPHIC SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IT WAS A PERFECT ICE BREAKER
THERE ARE SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT ARE REALLY MORE USEFUL IN A PLAYER GAME THEY ARE MARKED AND YOU REMOVE THEM IF YOU AREN'T PLAYING PLAYERS YOU ALWAYS SIT OUT ONE CARD EACH ROUND AND THEN DRAFT THE LIMITED POOL OF ACTION IS AUGMENTED WITH THE EPIC CARDS WHICH FLOW AROUND THE TABLE PRETTY FREELY
YOU CAN PRINT AND PLAY 2 ROOMS AND A BOOM WITHOUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE
THE LAST BANQUET MIGHT BE WORTH A LOOK

WHILE CODENAMES COULD THEORETICALLY HANDLE A GROUP THAT LARGE I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE ENOUGH CARDS IN THE BOX THAT YOU COULD GET 2 OR SEPARATE GAMES OF IT GOING AT THE SAME TIME
YOU COULD TRY DOING LARGER TEAMS FOR CODENAMES AND SPYFAULT BUT I HONESTLY DON'T SEE IT WORKING OUT THAT WELL THOSE GAMES ARE GREAT BUT HAVE A LIMIT FOR A REASON

THE ONLY GAME I CAN THINK OF RIGHT AWAY IS WEREWOLF USUALLY CAN ACCOMMODATE VERY LARGE GROUPS
IF THE STORE HAS VOYAGES I'D RECOMMEND GETTING IT IT'S OUT OF PRINT AT MOMENT AND HARD TO FIND FOR A REASONABLE PRICE
DON'T SELL KEYFLOWER SHORT IT IS ARGUABLY MORE ABOUT BIDDING BLOCKING THAN WORKER PLACEMENT AND FILLS A DIFFERENT NICHE THAN OR TERRA MYSTIC

STILL IF YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING TOO CLOSE TO THOSE GAMES SINCE YOU OWN THEM ALREADY PERHAPS EMET AND FIVE TRIBES WOULD HAVE A HIGHER PRIORITY

I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF UROSTYLE GAMES SO PERHAPS EMET WOULD BE THE NICEST ADDITION IT IS ONE OF THE FEW GAMES THAT GET MY FRIENDS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IN ATTACKING EACHOTHER

FIVE TRIBES IS A GREAT PUZZLE AND FEELS RELATIVELY UNIQUE
THE VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO IS THE PICK OF THE BUNCH FOR ME PUZZLE TENSE GAME WITH WILDLY ASYMMETRIC PLAYER POWERS
OF THOSE I HAVE PLAYED KEYFLOWER EMET AND FIVE TRIBES

FIVE TRIBES IS INTERESTING BUT I DIDN'T FIND IT THAT FUN I BASICALLY SPENT THE WHOLE GAME SEEING THE OTHER PLAYER'S MOVES AND THINKING WELL THAT WAS A MUCH BETTER PLAY THAN WHAT I DID TO BE FAIR I'VE ONLY PLAYED IT ONCE AND I COULD SEE IT GETTING MUCH BETTER WITH MORE PLAYS ONE OTHER POINT IS THE AP IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE

EMET IS GOOD FOR THE TECH TREES BUT I REALLY DON'T LIKE CARD PLAY DETERMINISTIC COMBAT ENOUGH SO THAT IT KINDA RUINED THE WHOLE GAME FOR ME I'D RATHER HAVE DICE OR JUST FLAT OUT BE KILLS IF YOU LIKE THAT KIND OF COMBAT AND I KNOW IT'S SUPER POPULAR IN MY GROUP THEN THIS IS A GAME YOU'LL PROBABLY LOVE

KEYFLOWER IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES NORMALLY I ABSOLUTELY HATE WORKER PLACEMENT AND I'M LUKE WARM ON BIDDING BUT KEYFLOWER PULLS IT OFF IN SUCH AN INTERESTING WAY WHERE YOU CAN MESS WITH THE WORKER PLACEMENT BY BIDDING AND VICE VERSA YOU CAN ALSO USE A SPACE THAT HAS BEEN USED BUT FOR GREATER COST SO THAT MAKES THE WORKER PLACEMENT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INTERESTING TO ME OVER ALL WITH THE MERCHANTS EXPANSION KEYFLOWER IS AMAZING WITHOUT THAT EXPANSION IT'S MERELY GREAT
BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT ORLEANS IT IS AN AWESOME GAME FAR AND ABOVE ANY OTHER GAME YOU HAVE LISTED


I OWN FIVE TRIBES AND EMET OUT OF THEM AND I WOULD NOT GET EMET IF YOUR GROUP WILL NOT PLAY IT MORE THAN LETS SAY TIMES IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE TILES THE GAME DRAGS ON AND IF THEY DON'T TRY TO STRATEGIZE THE GAME FALLS FLAT BUT IF YOUR GROUP IS COMPETITIVE AND WILL COME UP WITH CRAZY ENGINES THAN THE GAME REALLY SHINES THAT WAY LETS TALK ABOUT FIVE TRIBES NOW THIS IS MY THIRD FAVORITE GAME AFTER WONDERS AND BLOOD RAGE AND I THINK IT IS A EASY TO LEARN BUT HARD TO MASTER EURO I WAS ABLE TO PLAY THIS EVEN WITH MY MOM AND SHE BEAT US PRETTY WELL SO PEOPLE DOES NOT NEED TO BE GAMERS TO PLAY THIS ALTHOUGH IT HELPS WHAT THE DIFFERENT COLORED MEEDLESS AND TILE BONUSES DO IS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT HOW YOU COME UP WITH THOSE MOVES IS THE GAME SOMETIMES YOU FIND A CRAZY COMBO THAT WILL NET YOU POINTS AND SOME OF YOUR TURNS WILL SIMPLE BE GETTING POINTS BUT SETTING FOR DIFFERENT TURNS ONE WARNING ABOUT THE GAME THOUGH IF YOUR GAME GROUP IS AP PRONE CONSIDER GETTING SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE IF THIS GAME DRAGS PEOPLE GET DISTRACTED AND IT'S HARDER FOR EVERYONE

PS VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO IS EURO CONSTANTLY ON AMAZON DE AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET IT SOMETIME ELSE IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE OTHER GAMES FOR THE SAME PRICE

HOPE THIS HELPS IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS JUST REPLY ME

NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY WHEN FELL OUT OF HIS SPOT
DOES ANYBODY ACTUALLY LIKE SAM HEALEY HE WORE A CRINGE RULES FOR DATING MY DAUGHTER YOU CAN'T SHIRT ON SOME VIDEO RECENTLY SO I CAN'T IMAGINE HIS DAUGHTER EVEN LIKES HIM
WHERE ARE TOMS AND TOP GAMES
I LIKE IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL FOR THOSE OF YOU LOOKING DOWN ON HIM HE IS QUITE FRIENDLY IN PERSON YOU CAN TELL THAT HE IS INCREDIBLY APPRECIATIVE OF FANS WHO EXPRESS AN INTEREST IN HIM HE'S NOT THE OUTGOING PERSON THAT TOM IS BUT HE IS THAT GRUMPY FRIEND THAT YOU WOULD DEFEND TO DEATH IF HE WAS IN YOUR CIRCLE OF FRIENDS

I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH HIM AND HE CAN THROW HISSY FITS BUT I THINK HIS PERSPECTIVE IS DIFFERENT THAN TOM ZEE AND THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN'T STAND HIM PROBABLY DON'T GET ALONG WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THE REAL WORLD
SAM HAS ONLY PLAYED TWILIGHT IMPERIUM TWICE WHAT THE FUCK
WAS NOT SUPER INTERESTED IN THE ZOMBICIDE SERIES OF GAMES UNTIL I SAW HIS REVIEW AND WHAT HE MENTIONED ABOUT IT AFTER WATCHING A FEW MORE VIDEOS ON IT I THINK I'M GONNA TRACK DOWN A COPY OF BLACK PLAGUE
DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO HIS LISTS SINCE HIS TASTES DIFFER SO WILDLY FROM MINE BUT IN GENERAL I FIND HIM MORE SAD THAN GRATING ANNOYING THAT REDDITORS SEEM TO FEEL FELT THIS EVER SINCE I HEARD THEIR INTERVIEW THEY HAD WITH FAIDUTTI ON THEIR DICE STEEPLE PODCAST
IT'S JUST FUNNY WHEN AT LEAST OF THE GAMES ON THE LIST HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE LAST 2 YEARS IT DOES MAKE THE TERM OF ALL TIME A BIT LESS MEANINGFUL
THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT SOLO GAME OPTIONS BUT IF YOU WANT A STORY I'D RECOMMEND SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE PUT ON SOME CENTURY MUSIC PULL OUT A CANDLE SOME TEA AND TAKE OK YOUR FIRST CASE DON'T TRY TO BEAT SCORE BUT TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE FIRST CASE WITH THE NEWSPAPERS PHONEBOOK AND MAP OF LONDON PROVIDED IN THE BOX IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES TO PLAY SOLO
ALL THESE ARE GOOD GREAT SOLO GAMES

AT THE GATES OF LOYANG PURE OPTIMIZATION PUZZLE
THE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THE CARD GAME IT HAS GOOD SOLO MODE
EVEN THOUGH IT IS GAME IT IS GOOD AS SOLO GAME
ELDER SIGN UNSEEN FORCES YAHTZEE STYLE WITH PASTED CTHULHU THEME
ELDRITCH HORROR FORSAKEN LORE
FIVE TRIBES HAS OFFICIAL SOLO VARIANT
GHOST STORIES HARD AND UNFORGIVING
IMPERIAL SETTLERS SOLO MODE IS GOOD NOT GREAT BUT THERE IS OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN MODE I HAVEN'T TRIED

LEWIS CLARK I LIKE IT'S SOLO MODE YOU ARE TRYING TO BEAT A CLOCK NEUTRAL PLAYER THAT MOVES ONE PLACE A HEAD EVERY TURN
LIMES FAIRLY ABSTRACT CARCASSONNE TYPE OF GAME BINGO STYLE FOR 2 PLAYERS THAT CAN BE PLAYED SOLO BEAT YOUR SCORE INSTEAD OF OPPONENT'S
PANDEMIC
ROBINSON CRUSOE ADVENTURES ON THE CURSED ISLAND HIGHLY THEMATIC AND HARD GAME
SAMURAI SPIRIT
SNOWDONIA GREAT SOLO MODE AGAINST THE NEUTRAL COMPANY THAT ACTS AS A TIMER FOR THE GAME PROGRESS
MAGE KNIGHT
FRIDAY PURE SOLO GAME
PAX PORFIRIANA
MOST OF GAMES HAVE SOLO RULES
I LOVE SOLO GAMING I DIDN'T PARTAKE IN IT AT ALL UNTIL MY WIFE AND I HAD OUR SON AND NOW I DO MORE SOLO GAMING THAN MULTIPLAYER GAMING MY FAVORITES ARE THOSE GAMES THAT KEEP THE ESSENCE OF THE FULL GAME INTACT THAT DON'T NEED TO MAKE A LOT OF CHANGES TO ALLOW FOR SOLITAIRE PLAY I LIKE GAMES THAT HAVE YOU AIM FOR A CERTAIN SCORE AND ARE CHALLENGING

HAVING SAID THAT MY FAVOURITE SOLO GAMES OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO HAVE BEEN

A FEAST FOR ODIN

2 TERRAFORMING MARS

THE ALLERGIST

FIELDS OF ARLE

LIBERTY OR DEATH


I'M A BIG FAN OF ROSENBERG SO NOT SURPRISINGLY TWO OF THOSE TITLES ARE HIS GAMES HE TENDS TO BUILD VERY COMPELLING SOLITAIRE PLAY INTO ALMOST ALL HIS GAMES ODIN IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST SOLO GAME HE'S DONE BUT ARLE AND GATES OF LOYANG ARE ALSO AWESOME

IF YOU'RE INTO HEAVIER STUFF NAVAJO WARS AND THE COMANCHERIA ARE SOLO ONLY GAMES THAT TELL THE STORY OF TWO NATIVE TRIBES FROM EARLY
MARKHAM HORROR CG
LORD OF THE RINGS CG IS VERY MUCH STORY DRIVEN IT IS DARK WORLD OF DESPERATION WHERE YOU WILL TRY TO SEE IF GOOD CAN TRIUMPH OVER EVIL WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF LUCK YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL OF WHAT'S IN YOUR GAMEPLAY DECK THE GAME CAN BE PUNISHING BUT WINNING IS SO REWARDING
MY SOLO GAME IS SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL EASY TO SETUP FAST TO PLAY VERY WELL THEMED HARD AS NAILS AND BRUTAL AS HELL
I'M STILL PLAYING AMBUSH
TINY EPIC GALAXIES HAS A REALLY NICE SOLO MODE
CUBA LIBRE
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT MAGE KNIGHT POPS UP A LOT IN THESE SOLO THREADS AND IT IS A GREAT LOOKING GAME BUT IT IS MASSIVELY POLARIZING SOME PEOPLE LOVE IT OTHERS DESPISE IT DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE YOU PICK IT
I FIND THERE ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH CLASSES OF SOLO BOARD GAMES SHORT PUZZLES AND HUGE EXPERIENCES MOST PEOPLE WHO WANT ONE DON'T REALLY WANT TO BE RECOMMENDED THE OTHER

SHORT PUZZLE PLAYERS LIKE THINGS LIKE THE UNIVERSE SERIES MINUTES MAXIMUM WITH LOW THEME AND GAMEPLAY BASED AROUND SOLVING A SMALL SET OF PROBLEMS COLLECTING CARDS BUILDING THE RIGHT TERRIS SETUP ETC PLAYING THE HUGE EXPERIENCE GAMES WOULD BORE THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GAME ALONE FOR THAT LONG AT A TIME

HUGE EXPERIENCE PLAYERS WANT THEIR SOLO GAMES TO BE AS EPIC THEIR REGULAR GAMES THEY WANT TO KILL AN HOUR OR MORE WITH HUGE EXCITING THEMATIC SCENARIOS SUCH AS MAGE KNIGHT OR ROBINSON CRUSOE THE SMALL PUZZLE TYPE IS TOO TINY FOR THEM

WHICH ARE YOU
MAGE KNIGHT IT'S A VERY SATISFYING PUZZLE WHICH DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPLICIT STORY BUT YOU CAN VISUALISER THE ACTION BASED ON THE CARDS PLAYED
MAGE KNIGHT ROBINSON CRUSOE AND LOAR CG ARE ROUTINELY CONSIDERED THE BEST SOLO GAMES THE FIRST TWO ARE MORE STORY FOCUSED WHERE LOAR CG IS MORE STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL
WHEREAS PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED MAGE KNIGHT AND SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL I'M GONNA SAY LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS I'M A HUGE ALIEN FAN SO I PLAY THOUGH THE SCENES IN MY HEAD WHEN COMPLETING OBJECTS ONCE YOU'VE INITIALLY SORTED THE CARDS IT DOESN'T TAKE TOO LONG TO SET UP AND DOESN'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH ROOM
PROBABLY IMPERIAL ASSAULT OR THEY'RE THE ONLY GAMES OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD WHERE YOU CAN PLAY AS SOLO
I HAVE NOT TRIED THESE YET BUT MAYBE SOMEONE WHO HAS CAN RESPOND

I RECENTLY PICKED UP SCYTHE AND ALSO VITICULTURE WHICH BOTH HAVE SINGLE PLAYER RULES
MERCHANTS MARAUDERS WORKS GREAT WITH SOLO VARIANTS ALL OF THE ADVENTURE AND STORIES NONE OF THE DOWN TIME
KNIERIM IS A GREAT SOLO GAME SUPER FAST SETUP PLAY AND TEAR DOWN I'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF PLAYS OUT OF IT

SOS TITANIC IS A REALLY GOOD SOLO GAME TOO WHICH ISN'T SURPRISING AS IT IS BASED OFF OF KLONDIKE THE SOLO CARD GAME

ADDITIONALLY THE GOLDEN SOLO RULESET FOR MARVEL LEGENDARY IS GOOD
MAGE KNIGHT ELDRITCH HORROR SCYTHE DESCENT 2 WITH APP POSTHUMA

I'M A BIT SHOCKED NO ONE HAS MENTIONED MANSIONS OF MADNESS 2ND EDWARD IT'S HEAVY STORY THEMED BUT BE AWARE YOU MUST USE AN APP FOR IT IT'S FREE ON STEAM IOS AND ANDROID
RACE FOR THE GALAXY THE GATHERING STORM HAS A NICE SOLO EXPANSION
MY FAVOURITE SOLO GAME AT THE MOMENT WOULD BE WHERE THERE IS DISCORD BUT THAT GAME HAS A NICHE

I QUITE LIKE SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL AND FLASH POINT FIRE RESCUE TOO

NEVER MANAGED TO GET INTO ROBINSON CRUSOE BUT ALWAYS WILLING TO GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY

I ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEADER SERIES FROM DAN PERSSON I OKAY HEAPS OF THUNDERBOLT APACHE LEADER
ROBINSON CRUSOE IS A BASTARD OF A GAME THAT'S WORTH YOUR TIME EVEN WITH TEAMMATES THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF FAILURE ON EACH SCENARIO

VITICULTURE IS A LOVELY GAME THE SOLO VARIANT IS VERY MUCH ON THE AUTOMATA CARDS EVEN IF YOUR DESIRED MOVE IS BLOCKED ON ONE TURN YOU'LL HAVE OTHER VIABLE OPTIONS TO PLAY UNTIL THE NEXT SEASON CHANGE
I TOTALLY SECOND ROBINSON CRUSOE VERY THEMATIC AND DIFFICULT DEFINITELY CHECKOUT THE EXPANSION VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE

IF THE THEME OF MAGE KNIGHT DOESN'T STRIKE YOUR FANCY I WOULD ALSO CHECK OUT STAR TREK FRONTIERS BASICALLY THE SAME GAME WITH A STAR TREK THEME

FRIDAY AND FLEET ARE BOTH GREAT CARD GAMES SOLO FLEET GIVES YOU TWO AI CAPTAINS THAT ARE EASY TO PLAY WITH BUT ENJOYABLE TO BEAT


I'VE FOUND SOME REALLY GOOD SOLO WARGAMES TOO

DON'T TREAD ON ME IS AN INTERESTING TAKE ON THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR
ANY OF FIELD COMMANDER SERIES
ENEMY COAST AHEAD HAS GOOD STORY TO DRIVE THE GAME ALONG
LABYRINTH REALLY ENJOY THIS ONE AS A TWO PLAYER GAME BUT IS ALSO VERY CAPABLE AS WITH THE INCLUDED AI BOTS
NIGHTFIGHER THERE ARE SOME SOLO RULES YOU CAN FIND ON WEBSITE
AND AS MENTIONED ABOVE ANY OF THE COIN SERIES BUT IT FEATURES A BOT FLOWCHART SIMILAR TO LABYRINTH
ONE THAT ISN'T MENTIONED YET HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR IN THAT GAME YOU'RE A POLICE NEGOTIATOR TRYING TO DEFUSE A HOSTAGE SITUATION THE GAME IS REALLY TENSE AND THE THEME IS IMPLEMENTED VERY WELL

U GETINFO
DESCENT 2ND EDITION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING ROAD TO LEGEND APPARENTLY I'M ENJOYING MY SOLO EXPERIENCE QUITE A BIT
MICE AND MYSTICS
CURRENTLY MY FAVORITE SOLO BOARD GAME IS THE HOPLOMACHOS SERIES

NO OTHER GAME GETS PLAYED AS MUCH
I THINK THAT MIGHT CHANGE WITH THE CURRENT KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER KICKSTARTER BUT WE WILL SEE

CANNOT RECOMMEND HOPLOMACHOS ENOUGH THOUGH
I APPRECIATE SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE AS A SOLO GAME IT CAN BE A LOT TO KEEP TRACK OF BUT SINCE IT'S A COOPERATIVE GAME IT'S ALREADY BUILT FOR IT

IT'S VERY CUSTOMIZABLE WITH THE VARIOUS VILLAINS AND DECKS
IF YOU HATE PICKING UP PIECES OR YOU CAN ONLY PLAY IN A SHARED SPACE THAT REQUIRES PICKUP BETWEEN PLAYS SEARCH FOR THE APP IN THE MOBILE APP STORES FOR YOUR DEVICE

GAMES LIKE SPLENDOR PATCHWORK TRURO CATAN QWIRKLE TICKET TO RIDE LORD OF WATERDEEP ETC THEY'RE ALL ON THERE AND ALL PLAY WELL AGAINST THE AI OR ONLINE PLAY OR PASS AND PLAY
ELDRITCH HORROR IS CONSTANTLY THE ONE I GO BACK TO SOLO
MARVEL LEGENDARY IVE PLAYED IT ON MY OWN SO MANY TIMES
KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER IS MY FAVORITE LARGE SOLO GAME

FOR SMALL SCALE I LIKE SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL QUITE A BIT
I'VE REALLY BEEN ENJOYING WARHAMMER ACS SOLO AS WELL AS ELDER SIGN WITH ANY OF THE EXPANSIONS
ALSO A BIG FAN OF THE UNIVERSE GAMES
FIELDS OF ARLE LOOKS INTIMIDATING BUT IS AN AMAZINGLY FUN SOLO GAME SO ZEN LIKE AND MEDITATIVE I CAN WASTE A FEW HOURS JUST PUTTING TOGETHER MY VILLAGE AND CRAFTING GOODS AND TRADING THEM WITH OTHER VILLAGES IT'S SO REWARDING
LOOK UP DEATH ANGEL IT CAN BE PLAYED AS EASILY WITH PLAYER AS WITH
WARHAMMER THE ADVENTURE CARD GAME IS A FUN SOLO IT PLAYS THROUGH A MULTI PART CAMPAIGN WITH CHARACTER PROGRESSION AND CAN BE PRETTY CHALLENGING
I JUST GOT THE D D ADVENTURE BOARD GAME TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL AND AM LOVING IT I'VE PLAYED SOME ADVENTURES BY MYSELF CONTROLLING HEROES AND I'VE PLAYED SOME WITH MY WIFE BOTH STYLES WERE A LOT OF FUN FOR ME

I RECOMMEND IT AND IF YOU ALSO HAPPEN TO BE INTO TYPICAL D D THE MINIS AND TILES ARE PRETTY GREAT ADDED VALUE THE ELEMENTALS IN PARTICULAR FOR ME AS I USUALLY PLAY A MOON DRUID
ARABIAN NIGHTS STORY GAME AND CAN BE PLAYED SOLO I'D ARGUE IT'S ALWAYS AFFECTIVELY SOLO EVEN WHEN PLAYING WITH OTHERS
LA GANJA
THE OMEGA VIRUS
AGRICOLA LETS YOU PLAY SOLO
I REALLY LIKE FRIDAY IT'S ROBINSON CRUSOE THEMED BUT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A STORY OTHER THAN THE BASE THEME OF HELPING ROBINSON DEFEAT PIRATES
SUPRISINGLY SCYTHE IS VERY FUN ALONE WITH THE AUTOMA CARDS
DAWN OF THE ZEDS
DARKEST NIGHT
MY THREE FAVOURITE SOLO GAMES

SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL

FRIDAY

ROBINSON CRUSOE
OBLIGATORY MENTION OF
ELDRITCH HORROR
MAGE KNIGHT
ROBINSON CRUSOE

THESE ARE HANDS DOWN THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE
WE ALL HAVE THAT FRIEND WHO QUARTERBACKS PANDEMIC INTO A SOLO GAME
FRIDAY IS A GREAT SOLO EXPERIENCE KNIERIM IS ALSO A VERY FUN SOLO GAME
MAGE KNIGHT AND FALLING SKY ARE MY FAVORITE HEAVY SOLO GAMES BY A WIDE MARGIN
HAVE TO SAY HAVING TRIED LOAR CG AND GHOST STORIES THEY ARE JUST FAR TOO HARD TO BE ENJOYABLE PARTICULARLY GHOST STORIES
B QUEEN OF THE SKIES IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES YOU ARE MORE ALONG FOR THE RIDE DICE CHUCKING BUT YOU DO GET INVESTED IN YOUR PLANE AND CREW AND I FIND MYSELF CREATING NARRATIVES ABOUT THE MISSIONS AND FEEL QUITE SAD WHEN I LOSE A CREW MEMBER OR PLANE

I ALSO HAVE BEEN ENJOYING DAWN OF THE ZEDS RECENTLY YOU REALLY FEEL A SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS SO WHEN YOU WIN IT REALLY FEELS GRATIFYING AGAIN THE NARRATIVE IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT
NOT SURE ABOUT STORY THEMED ONES WHAT IS IT PARTICULARLY YOU ARE LOOKING FOR I'VE PLAYED SOME GAMES SOLO INCLUDING CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG TALISMAN AND SPLENDOR WITH VARIANT RULES AND I'VE ENJOYED THEM SOMEWHAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A MORE STORY HEAVY GAME BUT IF I'M LOOKING FOR A STORY AS WELL AS A GAME I USUALLY GO FOR THE GOOD OLD GAMEBOOKS BY STEVE JACKSON
I THINK THE BOARD GAME VERSION OF THIS WAR OF MINE WILL BE EXACTLY UP YOUR STREET IT'S MEANT TO BE MULTIPLAYER BUT THE INTERACTIONS AND MICRO MANAGEMENT SEEM GEARED UP TO MAKE A REALLY GOOD PLAYER BOARD GAME

THE KICKSTARTER FINISHED A WHILE AGO BUT IT'S NOT A MILLION MILES AWAY FROM PRODUCTION
DOMINION HAD A GREAT SOLO VAGIENT ONLINE YOUR GOAL WAS TO SEE HOW LONG YOU COULD HOLD OUT IT USED POISONS SETS SOME TURNS YOU'D GET A POISON OR YOU'D BE FORCED TO PURCHASE POISON IF YOUR POISON WAS OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT YOU'D QUIT AND SEE HOW MUCH VP YOU HAVE

EVENTUALLY YOU'D FIND IF YOU WERE CLOSE TO DYING YOU'D BUY MORE THINGS TO REMOVE POISON OR MORE VP AS A PART DITCH EFFORT BUT THEN YOUR DECK IS USELESS WITH CARDS THAT DON'T REALLY HELP SO IT WAS A JUGGLING ACT MOSTLY I ENJOYED IT
I LOVE A GOOD SOLO GAME I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I CAN PLAY A LITTLE CARD GAME SOLO LIKE THE ONES I MENTIONED BUT JUST I CAN'T BRING MYSELF TO PLAY THE FULL BLOWN BIG GAMES SOLO LIKE I HAVE GAMES LIKE PANDEMIC ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE AND THE GEARS OF WAR BOARD GAME AND THEY'RE ALL COMPLETELY BUT I FEEL SILLY JUST SETTING UP THIS BIG OFTEN ELABORATE BOARD JUST FOR ME

I'D SAY MY TOP SMALL SOLO TITLES ARE

TINY EPIC GALAXIES
2 SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL
HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR
CASTLE PANIC CASTELLATION SAME SERIES AS KNIERIM FRIDAY AND WONDERS DUEL ARE MY GOTOS

IN WONDERS DUEL I JUST PLAY EACH CITY AS OPTIMALLY AS I CAN SOMETIMES THROWING IN A PREFERENCE EAST G LEFT PLAYER GOES FOR SCIENCE AND RIGHT HAND GOES FOR MILITARY
FOR THE OBSCURE THUNDERBOLT APACHE LEADER
REPOST
I LIKE SUBURBIA SINGLE PLAYER I PLAY ON MY PHONE ALL THE TIME
I'M A BIG FAN OF AGRICOLA AND ALSO ELDRITCH HORROR FOR SOLO PLAY
MYRMEX IS THE KILLER APP FOR THE DECKERT

U GETINFO
I JUST GOT KNIERIM IT'S NOT BAD QUICK AND EASY GAMES ARE PRETTY SHORT AND THERE IS A 2 PLAYER OPTION I WON ON MY SECOND GAME I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH REPLAY VALUE IT'S GOING TO HAVE THOUGH IF I WANT SOMETHING DEEPER I JUST RUN 2 OR PLAYERS ON PANDEMIC
KINGDOM DEATH IS A GREAT SOLO GAME
IF IT'S A STORY YOU'RE AFTER AGENTS OF SMEARS A COLD WAR SPY ROMP WITH A CHOOSE YOUR ADVENTURE TYPE OF CAMPY ALSO A TOUCH OF EVIL A B MOVIE TYPE OF HORROR GAME WITH A CENTURY SETTING AND OLD SCHOOL MONSTERS TO BATTLE SAVE THE TOWN OF SHADOWBROOK
I'VE PLAYED A TON OF SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE SOLO AND I LOVED IT HAVING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS HELPS KEEP THE GAME FRESH AND THE TOWN VISITS GIVE A NICE FEELING OF PROGRESSION
AN OLDER WAR GAME LIKE AMBUSH OR ANOTHER SINGLE PLAYER WAR GAME

EDIT EDITING
FRIDAY IS A DECENT LITTLE GAME IT'S PRETTY SHORT SO I CAN PLAY IT WHEN I'M WAITING ON LAUNDRY OR ON BREAK AT WORK THE THEME IS PRETTY FUNNY TOO
I REALLY HATE TO BE THAT GUY BUT THIS IS YOUR EXACT TITLE

UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY ASKING A SPECIFIC QUESTION DOING A QUICK SEARCH WILL GIVE YOU THE TROVE OF USEFUL R BOARDGAMES STUFF I ONLY SAY THIS BECAUSE I SEE THE SAME QUESTION EVERY TWO WEEKS
MAGE KNIGHT THREAD
AGRICOLA IS QUITE A BIT TIGHTER THAN CAVERN FOR THE REASONS YOU STATE ABOVE I THINK AGRICOLA MIGHT WORK WELL FOR YOU
BASED UPON YOUR REASONS FOR DISLIKING CAVERN I THINK YOU HAVE A MUCH GREATER CHANCE OF ENJOYING AGRICOLA

ITS STILL A SOLIDARE GAME BUT YOUR COMPETITION FOR SPACES IS MUCH GREATER IF ONE PERSON TAKES WOOD THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO GET WOOD THIS TURN AND THAT TOTALLY SCREWS YOU OVER

IT IS FRAUGHT WITH TENSION BOTH FOR SPACES AND FOR FEEDING YOUR PEOPLE GREATER THAN HALF THE TIME I WAS TRYING TO FEED MY PEOPLE MORE THAN BUILDING MY FARM WHICH LEADS YOU TO FEEL LIKE YOU COULDN'T ACCOMPLISH ALL THAT YOU WANTED WHICH LEADS YOU TO COMING BACK FOR MORE

THE OCCUPATIONS AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS ALSO ADD A LEVEL OF DIRECTION AND RANDOM SETUP TO THE GAME AND MAKES IT HIGHLY REPAYABLE

IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE PLAYING WITH TWO OR THREE ALSO CHECK OUT LE HAVRE IT PROVIDES THE SAME TENSION FILLED WORKER PLACEMENT THAT AGRICOLA DOES
SOLITAIRE GAME THAT IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY THERE IS MORE COMPETITION OVER ACTION SPACES AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO BLOCK YOUR OPPONENT AT A CRUCIAL TIME IN THE GAME THOUGH

2 CAVERN IS PRETTY FORGIVING AND GIVES YOU SEVERAL WAYS TO GATHER THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES BUILD OVER DIFFERENT SPOTS ETC IN AGRICOLA THE ACTION SPACES ARE MUCH MORE LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITIES GENERALLY THEY ONLY PROVIDE ONE THING WHEREAS CAVERN HAS A LOT OF AND OR SPACES THAT ALLOW YOU TO DO MULTIPLE THINGS

AGRICOLA HAS ARGUABLY TWO MAIN STRATEGIES OBVIOUSLY THERE IS WIDE VARIATION AND OVERLAP BUT JUST FOR SIMPLICITY WE'LL CALL IT TWO RANCHER OR FARMER IN THAT SENSE THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF COMPETITION SINCE THERE ARE REALLY ONLY TWO RELIABLE WAYS OF BUILDING A FOOD ENGINE RACING TO GET THE FIRST FIREPLACE COOKING HEARTH SPOTS FOR ANIMALS SO YOU CAN FEED OR GETTING ALL THE NECESSITIES IN PLACE TO START FARMING 2 GRAINS 2 FIELDS AND AN OVEN

IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE AGRICOLA BUT GIVEN THAT YOU PUT SOLITAIRE AS YOUR POINT YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT I SUGGEST PLAYING A FEW GAMES ON BEFORE DECIDING TO BUY IT
AGRICOLA IS RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY FOR THE REASONS YOU STATED ABOVE I PLAN TO OWN BOTH CAVERN AND AGRICOLA I'M WAITING FOR THE EDITION IN

AGRICOLA HAS IMMENSE ENGINE FIGHTING AS THERE ARE ONLY MAYBE WAYS TO EFFICIENTLY MAKE FOOD ANIMALS ARE SCARCE AND SO IS STONE EVERYBODY WILL ALSO BE FIGHTING FOR THE FAMILY GROWTH SPOT WHEN IT COMES OUT AS WELL AND THE PLAY A MINOR IMPROVEMENT OCCUPATION SPOTS AS WELL
AGRICOLA IS WAY BETTER IT IS FAR LESS THAN CAVERN AS YOU WANT TO DO INSTEAD OF WHATEVER YOU WANT AND IF YOU DON'T DO EVERYTHING YOU LOSE POINTS THE GAME IS COLD AND CRUEL EACH TURN YOU MUST FACE THE TOUGH DECISION OF TAKING THE ACTION YOU THINK YOU WANT MOST OR THE ACTION YOU THINK YOUR OPPONENT WANTS MOST SO THAT YOU CAN BE SURE YOU GET THAT THING
AS SUCH THE GAME REALLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO CARE ABOUT WHAT YOUR OPPONENTS ARE DOING AND FIGURE OUT WHAT ACTIONS THEY WANT SO YOU CAN TAKE THEM FIRST

MY PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ARE
IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG TO SET UP IF YOU SET UP THE GAME AND ITS EXPANSION IT TAKES LITERALLY MINUTES TO SET UP AND THEN ANOTHER MINUTES TO CLEAN UP AFTERWARD
2 THE GAME TAKES FOREVER BASICALLY EVERYBODY I'VE PLAYED THIS WITH WILL TAKE MINUTE TURNS OVERTHINKING EVERYTHING INCLUDING MYSELF BRINGING THE GAME TIME TO SOMETHING LIKE MINUTES PER PLAYER WHICH IS ABSURD IF YOU EVER PLAY THIS GAME WITH PLAYERS BE SURE TO HAVE A 2 MINUTE STOP WATCH READY AND RESTRICT TURN LENGTH
THE GAME DOES SEEM A LITTLE IMBALANCE REGARDING MINOR IMPROVEMENTS AND OCCUPATION CARDS AS SUCH IT'S ESSENTIAL TO HAVE TWO ROUNDS OF DRAFTING BEFORE THE GAME AND THAT COULD TAKE MINUTES IN ITSELF DON'T DO THIS WITH NEW PLAYERS THOUGH AS THEY WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING
I'D RECOMMEND SPLENDOR AND COSMIC ENCOUNTER SPLENDOR IS GREAT FOR SHORT CASUAL PLAY AND COSMIC ENCOUNTER HAS A TON OF REPLACEABILITY
I'D RECOMMEND SMASH UP LOTS OF CONTENT AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET THE EXPANSIONS
ALL OF THE GAMES YOU'RE CONSIDERING LOOK GOOD

HERE ARE SOME OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

TERRA MYSTIC LIKE SETTLERS ON STEROIDS HAS ELEMENTS LIKE SETTLERS BUT YOU PLAY AS DIFFERENT RACES WITH VERY DIFFERENT POWERS AND ABILITIES NO DICE IN THIS GAME SO IT'S ALL PLANNING AND STRATEGY

BONANZA PARTY GAME WHERE YOU TRADE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEANS IT SHARES THE TRADING RESOURCES ELEMENT OF SETTLERS

BANG THE DICE GAME HIDDEN ROLES GAME LIKE RESISTANCE SECRET HITLER WHERE YOU'RE COWBOYS THAT SHOOT EACH OTHER QUICK FUN PARTY GAME THAT CAN PLAY UP TO

SHADOW HUNTERS CARD GAME SIMILAR TO BANG IT HAS HIDDEN ROLES AMONG DIFFERENT FACTIONS WHAT MAKES THIS GAME FUN IN MY MIND IS THE WIN CONDITIONS OF THE NEUTRAL CHARACTERS
SPAAAAAARTAAAAAACUUUUUUUUUUUUS

SERIOUSLY SPARTACUS A GAME OF BLOOD AND TREACHERY WAS THE GAME THEY MADE BEFORE SONS OF ANARCHY IT'S JUST AS VICIOUS AROUND THE TABLE WITH THE SAME CUT DEALS AND MAYBE STAND BY THEM MURDER YOUR OPPONENTS WORKERS AND GENERAL UNPLEASANTNESS

I'D ALSO SAY THAT I'M THE BOSS HAS A SIMILAR FEELING FOR DEALINGS AS THAT IS A GAME ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ABOUT NEEDING TO CUT DEALS WITH MULTIPLE PLAYERS

BUT CONGRATULATIONS ON PICKING UP THE GAME IT IS A GROSSLY TITLE
I'LL OFFER SOME GAMES THAT MAY PLAY DIFFERENT MECHANICALLY I EAST NOT WORKER PLACEMENTS BUT MAY OFFER THE SAME FEELING OF CUTTHROAT AND INTERACTION

GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME 2ND ED THE CRUX OF THE GAME IS TO GIVE SECRET ORDERS TO YOUR TROOPS TO MOVE ATTACK DEFEND ETC AND WHEN BATTLE OCCURS EACH SIDE PLAYS CARDS SIMULTANEOUSLY IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU ARE AFTER BUT THE GAME IS QUITE LONG AND SHINES AT PLAYERS

COSMIC ENCOUNTER PLAYERS TAKE CONTROL OF VASTLY DIFFERENT ALIEN FACTIONS AND YOUR AIM IS TO HAVE PRESENCE IN TERRITORIES THROUGH PLAYING ALL SORTS OF CRAZY CARDS IN BATTLES ATTACKER AND DEFENDER IN MAY CALL IN OTHER WILLING PLAYERS TO JOIN THEIR SIDE IN THE BATTLES CUTTHROAT HIGH INTERACTION HIGH STAKES THEY'RE ALL THERE

EMET THIS IS AN AREA CONTROL GAME WITH A LITTLE BIT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAYERS UPGRADE THEIR ARMIES AND ECONOMIES THROUGH A TECH TREE SYSTEM AND BATTLE IS RESOLVED BY SIMULTANEOUS REVEAL OF CARDS A LOT OF THE GAME IS ABOUT TACTICALLY SNEAKING INTO OTHER PLAYER'S TERRITORIES TO GAIN CONTROL
ARGENT THE CONSORTIUM CONSIDERABLY MORE COMPLEX BUT GREAT
ALSO WONDERING THIS BUT SOMETHING THAT IS PLAYABLE WITH 2 AND NOT THE GATEWAY STYLE THAT ALWAYS GETS RECOMMENDED
THIS GAME IS GREAT COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS THE CLOSEST FEELING I THINK
LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS ALWAYS SUGGESTED BY PEOPLE IN SIMILAR CASES I THINK BOTH ARE FUN BUT THEY REALLY AREN'T SIMILAR AT ALL

MAINLY JUST LEAVING THIS NOTE SO I'LL SEE WHAT GAMES EVERYONE ELSE POSTS
KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER
IT'S A TENUOUS CONNECTION BUT IS IT POSSIBLE YOU'RE THINKING OF CAVE EVIL
THE ART DOESN'T MATCH THE GRIMINESS ASPECT OF YOUR DESCRIPTION BUT MASSIVE DARKNESS IT'S MASSIVELY DARK IN HERE CYRIL HAS THE LIGHT DARK AND EQUIPMENT ASPECTS SO I THOUGHT I'D THROW IT OUT THERE
GLOOMHAVEN
IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT OUT MORE CHEAPLY I HEAR THE TABLETOP SIMULATOR VERSION IS GOOD
I'VE OWNED GIF DONN AND HERTZ I ENJOYED ALL OF THEM FOR A WHILE BUT TIRED OF ALL BUT GIF STILL CONSIDER THAT ONE THE BEST OF THE BUNCH BUT I HAVEN'T TRIED YINS OR PUNCT SO I CAN'T BE CERTAIN I DIDN'T COMBINE ANY OF THEM EITHER

CURRENTLY I SCRATCH MY ABSTRACT ITCH WITH HIVE THE ROSE KING AND ATON AND I'M HOPING TO ADD ARBORETUM TO THE MIX ONCE IT COMES IN ONE THAT I HAVEN'T PLAYED YET BUT HAS RECEIVED SOME POSITIVE ATTENTION LATELY IS ONITAMA
THE GIF SERIES IS GREAT MOSTLY

DONN AND YINS ARE MY FAVORITES HERTZ IS MY LEAST FAVORITE GIF AND TARR ARE AVERAGE FOR ME NEVER PLAYED PUNCT

I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF A TOURNAMENT WHERE ONE GAME AFFECTS PIECES IN THE NEXT JUST DO POINTS COUNTING OVER SEVERAL ROUNDS

THERE ARE TONS OF GREAT ABSTRACTS OUT THERE ABALONE MANCALA NINE MAN MORRIS SHOGI I RECOMMEND TRYING ALL THAT YOU CAN AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU ENJOY DOING IN ABSTRACTS AND THEN LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH HIGHLIGHT THAT FOR INSTANCE I LOVE CHESS AND HIVE GIVES ME THAT SAME FEELING QUICKER AND MORE PORTABLY
BARNES AND NOBLE HAS THEIR GAMES DISCOUNTED BY AND POSSIBLY MORE STACKED WITH BNCYBER
I LOOK EVERY YEAR AND CYBER MONDAY NEVER SEEMS TO BE A BIG TIME FOR BOARD GAME SALES THIS YEAR LOOKS SEEMS TO BE NO EXCEPTION
BETWEEN TWO CITIES EASY TO TEACH AND LEARN QUICK FUN FOR ALL AGES

I DON'T PLAY WITH CHILDREN SO THE REST WELL YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY

SPLENDOR EASY TO TEACH AND LEARN IF YOU LIKE DECK BUILDING DOMINION YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE THE ENGINE BUILDING IN THIS GAME

THE GAME A SIMPLE COOPERATIVE CARD GAME GREAT FOR PLANE RIDES AT A CAFE OR FOR A REGULAR GAME NIGHT

LOST TEMPLE VERY SIMPLE RACING GAME WITH SOME ROLE SELECTION IN THE MIX TO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING PROBABLY SIMPLE ENOUGH FOR KIDS AGAIN I WOULDN'T KNOW FOR SURE

CAMEL UP ANOTHER LIGHT RACING GAME BUT IN THIS GAME YOU BET ON THE CAMELS RACING RATHER THAN RACING THEM YOURSELF IT'S QUITE WACKY WITH LITTLE STRATEGY DON'T PLAY THIS GAME EXPECTING TO OPTIMIZE YOUR PLAY THERE IS A LOT OF LUCK AND IT'S JUST ZANY FUN

PARIS CONNECTION PROBABLY THE EASIEST GAME EVER IT'S A ROUTE BUILDING GAME WITH A STOCK MARKET THIS ONE HAS GONE OVER WELL FOR MY PARENT'S AND OTHER AS WELL AS GAMERS

BEST OF LUCK
MY REGULAR GAMING GROUP TYPICALLY CONSISTS OF MY RELATIVELY PARTNER MY YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND MY YEAR OLD MOTHER WHO SUFFERED A BRAIN INJURY LAST YEAR I'VE BEEN PLAYING ALL THINGS TABLE TOP FROM RAGS TO AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN FOR YEARS WE ALL ENJOY DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAMES AND REQUIRE A PRETTY SPECIFIC TYPE OF GAME FOR ALL OF US TO HAVE FUN WITH THAT SAID WE ALL LOVE

RHINO HERO UNIQUE AND SUPER EXCITING

CASTLE PANIC EASY TO UNDERSTAND COOPERATIVE PLAY CAN STILL BE A CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ADD IN THE EXPANSIONS

ZOMBIE DICE SUPER EASY BUT STILL FUN AND FAST YEAR OLD ESPECIALLY LOVES THIS ONE

WE LOVE EVERYTHING LOONEY LABS DOES FLUX PYRAMIDS JUST DESERTS

MOST RECENTLY WE'VE DELVED INTO NO THANK YOU EVIL WHICH IS A BLAST AND AN AWESOME INTRO TO TRADITIONAL TABLE TOP RPG ACTION

HOPE SOME OF THAT HELPS GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN


STAR REALMS

OH MY GOODS

TINY EPIC GALAXIES

SORRY IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE I CAN T ACCESS BG TO LOOK AT YOUR LIST
FIRST I'M GLAD THEY BRANCHED OUT FROM THEIR FIRST REVIEWS TO NOT JUST COVER MINIATURE GAMES I WAS WORRIED THEY WERE JUST GOING TO STICK TO TOO MANY SIMILAR STYLES THIS IS ESPECIALLY GOOD BECAUSE THE EDITING AND REVIEWS ARE SLICK AND POLISHED AND I FEEL WELL NEEDED I'M GLAD AS A WHOLE TO SEE MORE PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTIONS IN BOARD GAMING A LA MAN VS STEEPLE ETC

2ND THIS GAME LOOKS REALLY INTERESTING BUT THE LONG PLAY TIME IS MAKING ME REALLY HESITATE MIGHT HAVE TO TRY A FEW MORE LOOKS BEFORE COMMITTING TO SUCH A BEAST
I PLAYED THIS GAME AT GEN CON THIS YEAR AND IT WAS GREAT I'M VERY BIASED AS I ALREADY LOVE EVERYTHING FFA HAS DONE IN THE ANDROID UNIVERSE BUT I ENJOYED MY TIME PLAYING IT AND I'LL BE GETTING THIS THE FIRST CHANCE I GET
YEAH I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GOOD MEDIUM LENGTH NEGOTIATION GAME TO FOLLOW UP CHINATOWN LORDS OF VEGAS BUT THIS JUST SEEMS LIKE IT COULD TAKE WAY TOO LONG
SO IT'S ARCHIPELAGO WITH SOME SLIGHT CHANGES
I'VE NEVER BEEN FOND OF GAMES THERE IS NO INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVE TO STOP THE WE ALL LOSE MECHANISM IF I'M WINNING I DON'T WANT TO SACRIFICE THAT LEAD AND HELP SOMEONE ELSE BECOME FIRST TO KEEP THE GAME GOING AND IF I'M LOSING I HAVE NO REASON TO CARE IF WE ALL LOSE I LIKE MY PURE COOPERATIVE
NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT NEW ANGELES YET I LOVE NEGOTIATION GAMES BUT I DON'T THINK I'M THRILLED WITH THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF IT ALL NEGOTIATION GAMES ARE ON SOME LEVEL COOPERATIVE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU NEGOTIATE THIS SEEMS A BIT FORCED THOUGH
DECEMBER IS A WEDNESDAY
R BOARDGAMES COMMENTS

HERE'S THE LINK FOR THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION WHICH SAYS WEDNESDAY NOV
WHERE DID YOU SEE THEY WERE GOING TO SHIP ON THE EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN HAS SAID SIMPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TOO CRAZY FOR A YEAR I'VE BEEN PLAYING ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AND I HAVE LIKE GAMES LOL
THOSE ARE SOME GOOD GAMES AND WE HAVE SIMILAR TASTE REBELLION IS AMAZING HERE ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITE GAMES YOU'LL FIND THEY TREND TOWARDS THE SIDE BUT YOU SEEM TO LIKE THAT ANYWAY
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY
ECLIPSE
POWER GRID
SHOGUN
DIE MACHER
TERRA MYSTIC
THROUGH THE AGES
CAELUS
GALAXY TRUCKER
TIGRIS EUPHRATES
SAMURAI
DICE DUEL AND
PUERTO RICO
HOPE THAT HELPS HAVE A GOOD WEEK OF WATCHING REVIEWS
MONIKERS IS MY FAVOURITE PARTY GAME HANDS DOWN SUPER ACCESSIBLE AND I'VE PLAYED IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT GROUPS
WITH GOOD THEME SHOULD INTRODUCE YOU TO THEM A LIGHTER ONE THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE IS CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD BECAUSE IT HAS VIKINGS AND DRAGGER
WILL TABLETOP ON YOUTUBE DID A PLAYTHROUGH OF IT NOT THAT LONG AGO YOU COULD CHECK IT OUT

I THINK SOME HEAVY LIKE THE BOARD IS A KIND OF CALENDER AND IT MOVES AND TERRA MYSTIC LOTS OF RACES MAGIC AND CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE BITTERLY HAVE A GREAT THEME TO THEM OR EVEN POWER GRID IF YOU LIKE TO SET UP AN ENERGY COMPANY BUT IT'S A BIT MORE DRY

GOOD LOOK WITH YOUR SEARCH
THAT LOOKS LIKE AN AWESOME CLOSET TO HAVE

YOUR FRIENDS ARE BEING DUMB I'D PLAY SAMURAI SPIRIT ANYTIME SEVEN SAMURAI IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME

I WOULDN'T JUST TRY A EURO TO SEE IF THEY'RE YOUR THING WITHOUT GETTING A RECOMMENDATION FROM SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS YOUR GAMING STYLE AND DRIVE YOU COULD EASILY BE TURNED OFF A WHOLE STYLE OF GAME BECAUSE THEY MATCHED YOU TO A THEME AND ARTWORK INSTEAD OF GAMEPLAY YOU FIND COMPELLING I SHOULD WRITE A Q A FORM FOR THAT
CAME TO THE THREAD EXPECTING TO SEE TWO FULL KALLAXES PLEASED TO SEE ONLY ONE CLOSET SHELF
IMPERIAL ASSAULT OFFERS A CAMPAIGN GAMEPLAY WITH CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND DECISIONS THAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON HOW THE CAMPAIGN PROCEEDS AT ITS BASE IT'S A STRATEGIC COMBAT GAME WITH SOME STORY ELEMENTS AND LIGHTWEIGHT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
IT'S A VS MANY GAME SO SOMEONE IN YOUR GROUP NEEDS TO PLAY AGAINST THE OTHERS A COMPANION APP IS IN THE WORKS BUT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE RELEASE SCHEDULE
YOU'LL ALSO GET A GREAT SKIRMISH MODE IN THE SAME BOX WHICH MIGHT ADD SOME VALUE TO YOU IF YOU'RE INTO SKIRMISH BATTLES

MANSIONS OF MADNESS IS MORE IMMERSIVE I THINK BUT IT DOESN'T OFFER CAMPAIGN GAMEPLAY OR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN THE SCENARIOS THE REPLAY VALUE MIGHT ALSO BE A BIT LOWER THAN IN IA BUT OVERALL I LIKE MOM MORE THAN IA
MOM FOCUSES MORE ON THE STORY AND INVESTIGATION YOU'LL BE SOLVING PUZZLES FINDING ITEMS AND TRYING TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OR DEFEAT THE BOSS BEFORE YOU RUN OUT OF TIME THANKS TO THE APP THE SCENARIOS HAVE SOME RANDOMIZATION BUT ONLY MINOR THINGS AND NOBODY NEEDS TO PLAY THE BAD GUYS

IA IS MORE COMBAT ORIENTED THAN MOM ALTHOUGH MOM HAS STILL LOTS OF COMBAT WHICH ISN'T AS STRATEGIC AS IN IA AND IS THE WEAKEST PART OF THE GAME

I GUESS BETWEEN THOSE TWO THE QUESTION IS DO YOU PREFER STORY OVER STRATEGY BOTH ARE GREAT GAMES BUT THEY SCRATCH TOTALLY DIFFERENT ITCHES FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM AND TELL MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING FROM THEM AND WHAT KIND OF GAMES YOU PREFER
I'VE PLAYED COUPLE OF THE SCENARIOS MULTIPLE TIMES AND HAVE BEEN ENJOYING THEM EVERY TIME I GUESS AT SOME POINT PLAYING THE SAME SCENARIOS OVER AND OVER AGAIN STARTS TO GET REPETITIVE AS WITH EVERY GAME BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY THEM FEW TIMES WITHOUT ISSUES ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU'VE OPENED ALL THE SCHEMATICS AND IF YOU PLAY WITH A DIFFERENT CHARACTER EACH TIME

I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR PLAN OF PLAYING ONLY WITH TWO PLAYERS I THINK YOU WOULD GET THE MOST OUT OF THE GAME WITH FOUR PLAYERS BUT I GUESS YOU CAN PLAY WITH BOTH CONTROLLING TWO MACHS
IT'S A PRETTY FUN PROGRAMING GAME I DID WISH THAT THERE WERE MORE BATTLE CARDS TO COMBINE BUT IT WORKS AS IT IT I JUST PLAYED IT AGAIN TWO DAYS AGO AND WAS TELLING MYSELF THAT I WOULDN'T MIND PLAYING THAT MISSION AGAIN

ALL MISSIONS COME CLOSED OFF IN AN ENVELOPE TO KEEP THE SURPRISES COMING FOR THE STORY BUT YOU CAN EASILY JUMP TO PREVIOUS MISSIONS ON A WHIM

MISSIONS DO PLAY SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER AND YOU DON'T DRAW THE SAME CARDS AS YOU WOULD IN PREVIOUS ROUNDS AND IF YOU DID THERE'S STILL NO GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL GET THE SAME CARDS BECAUSE YOUR PERSONAL PROGRAMING BOARD IS ALREADY SET UP DIFFERENTLY OR THE PERSON BEFORE YOU TOOK A CARD THAT THEY NEEDED

I DIDN'T FALL FOR THE HYPE WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED AND WAS AVAILABLE FOR BUT IF TWO OF MY FRIENDS THAT I PLAY WITH DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE THE GAME I WOULDN'T MIND BUYING IT FOR MYSELF IT'S A FUN LITTLE CHAOTIC CO-OP WHERE YOU HAVE TO WORK AROUND WHAT IS GIVEN TO YOU AND ALL THE LITTLE THINGS THAT TRY TO STRAY YOU FROM YOUR PLANS IT ALSO COMES IN A HUGE BOX BIGGER THAN ANY BOARD GAME I'VE EVER SEEN
THE CAMPAIGN IS REALLY JUST TEN SCENARIOS IT'S NOT SOMETHING LIKE DESCENT WHERE A BIG OVERARCHING STORY IS BEING TOLD THEY COULD REALLY BE PLAYED IN ANY ORDER YOU WANT BUT THEY HAVE A FEW NARRATIVE ELEMENTS IF YOU PLAY THEM ORDER

THE GAME WASN'T FOR ME BUT THERE ARE ABOUT REVIEWS SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD IDEA WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SOMETHING YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN
I'M PLAYING A FEW OF THE SCENARIOS TWICE I'M GOING THROUGH IT CAMPAIGN STYLE WITH MY FRIENDS AND THEN I'M PICKING SCENARIOS AND PLAYING THEM AT THE LOCAL BOARD GAME NEETUP

THE NEETUP PEOPLE DON'T LOSE ANYTHING BY NOT HAVING PLAYED THE EARLIER SCENARIOS EXCEPT THAT THE RULEBOOK ISN'T REALLY COMPREHENSIVE AT ALL AND SOME RULES ARE HIDING IN PREVIOUS MISSION PACKETS SO THEY HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT

I WIND UP PLAYING SOME OF THE SCENARIOS TWICE BUT IT'S NOT LESS FUN FOR ME BECAUSE I CAN SWITCH CHARACTERS USE DIFFERENT SPECIAL POWERS AND OBVIOUSLY THE CARDS WILL SHAKE OUT DIFFERENTLY

AND THEN THERE'S SUPPOSEDLY HARD MODE RULES FOR EACH SCENARIO IN THE LAST PACKET WHICH I WILL DEFINITELY USE FROM THEN ON BECAUSE SO LONG AS WE HAVE PLAYERS I'VE FOUND THE GAME TO BE PRETTY EASY
IS KIND OF ON PAR WITH A GAME LIKE PANDEMIC THERE IS ENOUGH RANDOM COMPONENTS DEPENDING ON SCENARIO TO KEEP THE GAME INTERESTING FOR A FEW PLAYS SO IF YOU CAN HANDLE A GAME LIKE PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF REPLACEABILITY THEN MGM SHOULD REALLY BE NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT
UNIQUE CHARACTERS EACH HAVE A DIFFERENT OVERDRIVE ABILITY AND SCHEMATIC CARDS
DIE ROLL FOR SPAWNING AND MOVEMENT OF MINIONS
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS EACH WITH DIFFERENT RULES OR NEW INTRODUCED MECHANICS

NOW WILL IT GET BORING PROBABLY IF YOU ARE TRULY INVESTED IN THE STORY ASPECT THE STORY DOESN'T CHANGE THE PROGRAMMING CARDS ONLY COME IN FLAVORS SO IT DOES GET STALE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOUR MECH CAN DO I SAY IF YOU CAN GET PLAYS OF THIS THEN IT'S PROBABLY WORTH IT PLAY IF YOU DON'T ENVISION ON EVER PLAYING IT AGAIN YOU CAN JUST RESELL IT I SINCERELY DOUBT THE MARKET FOR THIS GAME WILL DROP ANYTIME SOON EVEN WITH RIOT RESTOCKING THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES DISTRIBUTING THE GAME AND SHIPPING IT PROBABLY WONT GET CHEAPER THAN THAT UNTIL MAYBE A YEAR IF THEY NEED TO CLEARANCE IT OUT SO YOU COULD ALWAYS RESELL IT AND IT WOULD BE A DECENT RETURN FOR HRS OF GAME PLAY

NOW IT'S UNKNOWN IF THEY PLAN ON EXPANDING IT EVEN JUST ADDING A SCENARIO EXPANSION WOULD BRING NEW LIFE INTO THIS GAME BUT I'M SURE THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF SCENARIOS TO TACKLE THIS COULD EASILY BE A FUN SYSTEM
THREAD 2 HERE
LOOK UP THE MARTIAN FILES INVESTIGATIONS VERY SIMILAR FORMAT BUT BASED UPON A MARTIAN MINING TOWN I THINK IT COSTS A DOLLAR OR TWO
AND ALL EXPANSIONS

OH DAMN NOW I'M JEALOUS I LOVE THE BASE GAME BUT DON'T EXACTLY HAVE THE SCRATCH TO EVEN CONSIDER THE EXPANSIONS HAHA
I REALLY WISH YOU HAD A PORTLAND OR COUNTERPART I WOULD JUMP AT THAT CHANCE IN A HEARTBEAT
IF YOU WANT TO SKYPE IN A CENTRAL WASHINGTON COUNTERPART

THERE'S A DECENT NUMBER OF GAMES RUNNING ON TABLETOP SIMULATOR JUST FYI FOR ANYONE ELSE WAITING ON THEIR COPY TO FINISH MAKING MILLION DOLLARS AND SHIP OUT
THAT SOUNDS FUN I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I'LL HAVE UNTIL AFTER FINALS THOUGH
ARE THERE ANY UPCOMING CONS YOU COULD SEE IF SOMEONE WITH A COPY IS VISITING ONE AND BY THAT I MEAN YOUR LIKELY GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A TRIP UP TO THE BAY OR DOWN TO LA AREA

MY PARENTS ARE NOT GAMERS ALTHOUGH MY MOTHER IS IN A WEEKLY SCRABBLE GROUP A FEW YEARS AGO MY GIRLFRIEND NOW WIFE AND I INTRODUCED THEM TO QWIRKLE AND BOY DID THEY LIKE IT WE BROUGHT IT UP FOR CHRISTMAS AND BECAUSE I USED A APP ON MY PHONE I KNOW THAT WE PLAYED AT LEAST ONE GAME EVERY DAY FOR THE NEARLY TWO WEEKS WE WERE UP THERE ANY TIME WE VISITED THEM OR THEY VISITED US THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST ONE GAME PLAYED AND FOR MY DAD'S BIRTHDAY ONE YEAR WE GOT HIM A SET SO THEY COULD PLAY TOGETHER PARTICULARLY USEFUL WHEN THEY WENT ON A LOVELY BEACH HOLIDAY AND THE WEATHER TURNED TO CRAP FOR MOST OF THEIR TIME

TO BE HONEST MY WIFE AND I GOT A LITTLE TIRED OF ALL THE QWIRKLE IT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD GAME BUT IT GOT A BIT MUCH SO LAST YEAR WE TAUGHT THEM CODENAMES AND THAT CHRISTMAS I THINK WE MANAGED ONE GAME OF QWIRKLE IT WAS AMAZING AND WE'D BETTER REMEMBER TO PACK IT WHEN WE GO UP THIS YEAR OR THERE'LL BE HELL TO PAY
WHEN I GOT BACK INTO BOARDGAMING THIS SUMMER MY BROTHER WAS SUPER RELUCTANT TO PLAY SUBURBIA HE LOOKED AT THE RULE PAGES AND JUST SIMPLY SAID THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED I WATCHED A HOW TO PLAY VIDEO MIGHT HAVE BEEN RADIO AND WALKED HIM THROUGH IT HE INSTANTLY LOVED IT AND WE PLAYED IT TIMES THAT DAY WELL HE STILL LOVES IT AND BEATS ME EVERY SINGLE TIME IN PROBABLY OR PLAYTHROUGHS I HAVE ONLY BEAT HIM ONCE HE EVEN FLAT OUT TOLD ME HIS STRATEGY JUST GET HIS INCOME AS HIGH AS HE POSSIBLY CAN AND THEN HE HAS ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY ANY TILE HE WANTS AFTER LOSING EVERY SINGLE TIME I DON'T EVEN REALLY CARE TO PLAY IT ANYMORE WE PLAYED A PLAYER GAME LAST NIGHT WITH THE INC EXPANSION AND THE GOAL ON TOP OF THE C STACK WAS REP GOING FOR THAT ONE PUT MY INCOME SO FAR IN THE HOLE I SPENT THE WHOLE C STACK LAKING JUST TO PAY THE NEGATIVE INCOME FEE BECAUSE MY BROTHER SPENT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME BUYING EVERY SINGLE FACTORY THINKING ABOUT THAT GAME DRIVES ME NUTS
2 WEEKS AGO I HAD 2 BUDDIES AT MY PLACE ONE NEVER PLAYED ANY BOARD GAMES WHATSOEVER AND WHILE THE OTHER ONE DID THEY BOTH WEREN'T REALLY MUCH INTO BOARD GAMING BUT THAT SUNDAY THEY WANTED TO GIVE IT A TRY TOOK ME SEVERAL WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS TO PERSUADE THEM WITHOUT THEM NOTICING I HAD TO THINK HARD WHAT WOULD APPEAL TO THEM SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE TO PLAY WITH A SHORT PLAYING TIME AND LOTS OF INTERACTION SO I THOUGHT HISTORY WAR DICE I PULLED REBELLION OUT AND WOW WE HAD SUCH A BLAST PLAYING IT THEY LOVED IT SO MUCH THAT THEY CAME NEXT SUNDAY AGAIN TO PLAY IT WE WOULD HAVE PLAYED IT THIS SUNDAY ALSO BUT ONE OF THEM HAD SOME WORK RELATED STUFF TO DO
THEY ARE STILL WARY OF LONGER GAMES BUT THEY ARE STARTING TO SHOW SOME REAL INTEREST IN CYCLADES PUERTO RICO MOMBASA CONCORDIA DEAD OF WINTER AND ALSO GAMES LIKE FALLING SKY ONE OF THEM WANTS THIS ONE TO BE OUR NEXT GAME FIRE IN THE LAKE MARIA AND A GAME OF THRONES I SAY I TURNED THEM INTO BOARD GAME AFFICIONADO BUT IT SURELY IS A BIG CHANGE OF MIND
A FRIEND OF OURS IS DATING A GAMER BUT IS NOT ONE THEMSELF WE TOLD THEM ABOUT HOKKAIDO AND IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE A ART HISTORY MAJOR THAT DO THEIR SENIOR THESIS ON HIROSHIGE THE GAME IS BASED ON THE FIFTY-THREE STATIONS OF THE HOKKAIDO AND IT DREW THEM RIGHT IN JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT SOMETIMES IT JUST TAKES THE RIGHT GAME
MY FRIEND AND I MET UP TO PLAY GAMES AT A LOCAL CAFE LAST NIGHT AND ENDED UP TEACHING PEOPLE FROM THE NEXT TABLE OVER TO PLAY CARCASSONNE I HEARD THEM SAY OOH WE SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT CARDS AND I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS ABOUT TO TEACH MY FRIEND A FUN BOARD GAME AND THEY SHOULD JOIN IN

THEY ENDED UP BOTH SAYING THAT THEY LOVED IT AND ASKED WHERE THEY COULD GET A GAME LIKE THAT
IF SMALL WORLD OR CATAN BOMBS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO THINK AND COMPETE I BREAK OUT PANDEMIC

USUALLY EVERYONE IS MORE THAN HAPPY TO LET ME COACH AND THEY ENJOY THE THEME AND THE COLLECTIVE EFFORT INSTEAD OF I GUESS I WILL LOSE TO MY ACTUARY SON-IN-LAW AGAIN
ELDRITCH HORROR IS A GREAT THEMATIC COOP GAME THAT PLAYS WELL AT ANY PLAYER COUNT ALSO FOR SCI-FI SPECIFIC I WOULD RECOMMEND SPACE CADETS AWAY MISSIONS THESE TWO GAMES ARE PRETTY LUCK HEAVY HOWEVER I HAVE NEVER PLAYED A STRONGLY THEMATIC STRATEGIC TACTICAL GAME
XENOSHYFT OR LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN PERHAPS
I THINK YOU MIGHT ENJOY SPACE ALERT A REAL-TIME COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE YOU NEED TO WORK EFFICIENTLY WITH YOUR TEAM MATES TO SURVIVE CERTAIN SPACE DEATH
FOR AN INTERESTING THEMATIC AND FAIRLY HIGH SKILL LOW LUCK CO-OP GAME MYSTERIUM SEEMS LIKE A GOOD CHOICE THOUGH YOU WILL HAVE A RANDOM SET OF CARDS AND SOLUTIONS THE GAME IS REALLY ALL ABOUT COMMUNICATION AND THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THINGS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OTHER PLAYER S
TERRAFORMING MARS IT'S GREAT FOR GROUPS UP TO FIVE COOPERATIVE BUT WITH POINTS DECLARING A VICTOR AT THE END
WHILE SHARING SOME MECHANISMS AND ICONOGRAPHY THE REST OF THE GAME IS QUITE DIFFERENT OPEN-FACED DRAFTING IN GENERAL IS BETTER FOR LOWER PLAYER COUNTS AND EXCELS IN DUEL

I DO THINK THERE IS A PLACE FOR BOTH GAMES IN A COLLECTION BUT IF I HAD TO PICK ONE FOR TWO PLAYERS IT WOULDN'T BE CLOSE DUEL IS THE WAY TO GO
YES VERY MUCH I THINK DUEL IS VASTLY SUPERIOR TO THE WONDER VARIANT IT'S WAY MORE INTERESTING AND ENGAGING SO MUCH SO THAT I DON'T THINK I EVER WANT TO PLAY THE FULL GAME AGAIN
WONDERS DUEL PLAYS LIKE A TWO PLAYER GAME THE TWO PLAYER VARIANT IN WONDERS FEELS LIKE A THREE PLAYER GAME WHERE THE THIRD PLAYER IS A DICK AND JUST HATE DRAFTS EVERY CARD LONG STORY SHORT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WONDERS WITH TWO GET DUEL IT'S A GREAT GAME AND WORTH OWNING EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE FULL GAME

I KNOW I'M IN THE MINORITY ON THIS BUT I REALLY REALLY DISLIKE I GET THE DESIGN I THINK IT'S GREAT AT WHAT IT DOES AND I THINK IT'S AN EXPERIENCE DEVOID OF ANY FUN WHATSOEVER AND WILL NOT BE PLAYING IT AGAIN I'D RATHER PLAY WITH IT'S GOOFY 2 PLAYER RULES
THEY'RE REALLY DIFFERENT GAMES

I THINK IS PURELY AN IMPROVEMENT DESIGN WISE OVER AS FAR AS ICONOGRAPHY GOES IN CARD UPGRADES AND BALANCE
APPLES TO AIRPLANES IS THE COMPARISON HERE

THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT GAMES IF I HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN PLAYING ORIGINAL WONDERS 2 PLAYER REGARDLESS OF THE VARIANTS I HAVE TRIED OUT AT THIS POINT AND DUEL DUEL WINS WITHOUT QUESTION IT WINS EVERY TIME IT WINS BY A COUNTRY MILE

YOU'RE NEVER MANAGING THE GAME SO IT BECOMES PLAYABLE AT 2 I HAVE YET TO PLAY A VARIANT THAT GOT AROUND THIS DUEL HAS NO MANAGEMENT OUTSIDE OF ROUND SET UP IT'S VERY CLEAN AND WELL CONSIDERED IT'S ALSO WONDERFULLY BALANCED WHICH IS SOMETHING A LOT OF 2 PLAYER GAMES TOO OFTEN STUMBLE ON
WONDERS DUEL IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME FROM WONDERS THERE IS LOTS OF DIRECT PLAYER INTERACTION UNLIKE THE VARIANT
DUEL IS A DIFFERENT GAME ALL TOGETHER AND IT WAS MADE FOR TWO A LOT OF TIMES PUBLISHERS PUSH THE LIMITS OF PLAYER COUNT JUST TO MAKE SALES EVEN THOUGH THE DESIGN DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL WITH 2 OR SOMETIMES BIGGER GROUPS WONDERS JUST LOOSES ITS FLAIR WHEN YOU HAVE TO ALTERNATE A GHOST PLAYER IT'S MORE ACCOUNTING AND QUITE TAXING IN MY OPINION
THIS SEEMS LIKE A DECENT THREAD TO ASK HOW DOES WONDERS DUEL COMPARE TO TIDES OF MADNESS I HAVE TOM AND I REALLY DIG THE STREAMLINED SET COLLECTION WITH THE MADNESS MECHANICS ADDING THE LITTLE EXTRA OOMPH IS IT WORTH CONSIDERING IF I HAVE TIDES OF MADNESS
I REALLY PREFER THE MOMENT VARIANT OFFERS PEEKING AT YOUR OPPONENT AFTERWARDS IS SUCH A SATISFYING EXPERIENCE
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WONDERS DUELS IT SHARES SOME SIMILARITIES WITH THE MAIN GAME BUT STILL MANAGES TO DIFFER IN MANY AREAS IT IS ALSO REALLY QUICK AND EASY TO PICK UP ALL PIECES ARE IN VERY HIGH QUALITY AND THE GENERAL DESIGN OF IT FEELS REALLY SOLID IF YOU ENJOYED WONDERS I'M SURE YOU'LL GET SOME ENJOYMENT OUT OF THIS AS WELL

ONE THING TO NOTE THERE ARE DIFFERENT WIN CONDITIONS TO THE GAME BUT AFTER AROUND PLAYS WE'VE ONLY EVER MANAGED TO END THE GAME WITH THE SCORING WIN CONDITION IT COULD BE BAD LUCK OR JUST OUR OWN STYLE OF PLAY BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO BE FLESHED OUT MORE
WATCH THE DICETOWER REVIEW OF WONDERS DUELS IT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION PERFECTLY

MY F BOUGHT ME WONDERS DUEL ABOUT DAYS AGO SO FAR WE HAVE PLAYED AROUND GAMES AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT WE DIDNT LIKE ORIGINAL WONDERS THAT MUCH CAUSE OF THE LACK OF PLAYER INTERACTION BUT THE 2 PLAYER VERSION IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT IT IS INTENSE VERY FLUID STRATEGIC AND SUPERFAST AN AVERAGE GAME TAKES PROBABLY AROUND MINUTES MY F AIN'T THAT MUCH INTO BOARD GAMES BUT SHE LEVEES WONDERS DUEL SHE SAYS ITS HER FAVORITE GAME AND HECK THIS MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE 2 PLAYER GAME ALSO FOR ME PERSONALLY WONDERS DUEL IS JUST BETTER IN EVERY WAY
JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT WE JUST BOUGHT DUEL EXCITED TO PLAY IT AFTER READING ALL THESE COMMENTS

BEEN TRYING TO BUILD UP GAMES WITH GREAT 2 PLAYER OPTIONS A LOT OF TIME DRAFTING GAMES DON'T HAVE GREAT VARIANTS
I AM IN THE MINORITY ON THIS BUT I ACTUALLY THINK THE DUMMY PLAYER IN WONDERS IS BRILLIANT MY FIANCEE WAS ABLE TO TURN THE DUMMY INTO A MACHINE FOR HERSELF BY FORCING HIM TO BUILD CARDS THAT REQUIRED THE RESOURCES SHE WAS PRODUCING

I LIKE WONDERS DUEL BUT IT'S A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT GAME AND IF I HAD TO CHOOSE ONLY ONE I WOULD GO WITH THE ORIGINAL
THE BACK OF THE BOX CALLS IT CAMEL UP
IF THE GROUP YOU'RE PLAYING WITH CALLS IT CAMEL UP CORRECT THEM AND TELL THEM IT'S CAMEL CUP AND VICE VERSA
IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED AMEL CUP THE FACT THAT THE AMEL CUP IS RACED WITH CAMELS IS DEFINITELY CONFUSING THOUGH
I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU CALL IT CAMELUS OR CAMELCUP SO LONG AS YOU USE CAMELCASE
THE TITLE IS SUPPOSED TO BE CONFUSING READ BOTH WAYS EVEN THOUGH THE OFFICIAL NAME IS CAMEL UP

THE WORKING TITLE IN GERMAN WAS T FOLLES KAMEL WHICH EITHER MEANS GREAT OR OLD CAMEL
I READ SOMEWHERE THAT IT WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO BE CAMEL CUP BUT WHEN TRANSLATED INTO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IT HAD CERTAIN IMPLICATIONS OF THE GENITAL VARIETY AND SO THEY CHANGED IT TO CAMEL UP FOR THAT REASON THE WAY THE TITLE GRAPHIC IS POSITIONED IS ON PURPOSE AS A NOD TO THE ORIGINAL TITLE BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF TRANSLATION DISTRIBUTION THEY WILL ALWAY SAY IT'S CAMEL UP
I WAS GOING TO UNVOTE THIS THREAD TO PROMOTE DISCUSSION OF WHAT IS TRULY THE MOST CONTENTIOUS POINT IN BOARD GAMING

BUT THEN YOU COMMITTED HERESY AGAINST THE CAMEL UP EMPIRE
WAIT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT CAUMPEL
PROBABLY MY FAVORITE GAME

I'VE PLAYED IT TIMES AND ALL THE TIMES HAVE BEEN UNDER MINUTES ALL WITH PLAYERS EVEN WITH A RULES EXPLANATION

SHORTEST GAME WAS MINUTES WITH PLAYER AFTER A TIED VICTORY CONDITION AND WINNER TAKING IT WITH 2 CONDITIONS

I'VE READ THAT SOME PEOPLE TAKE A REALLY LONG TIME WHEN THEY DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE RULES AND THE GAMES CARRIES ON WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE ENDED MANY ROUNDS PRIOR DUE TO A VICTORY CONDITION BEING MET BUT MISSED

IT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA TO BRUSH UP ON ALL THE RULES SO THAT YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT CARRYING IT LONGER DUE TO A MISINTERPRETED RULE

A GOOD WAY TO SPEED THE GAME UP AND MAKE IT REALLY INTERESTING IS TO NOT THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THE BUILD A STRATEGY PLAY

THE GAME CHANGES SO QUICKLY THAT IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPITALIZING OPPORTUNITY RATHER THAN A BUILD MECHANIC LIKE EMET

JUST MY TWO CENTS

I'VE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE THIS IS A GAME WITH A BIT OF A LEARNING CURVE THOUGH MY LAST GAME TOOK HOURS BUT EVERY TURN AFTER THE FIRST MINUTES SOMEONE WAS ALLLLMOST THERE I IMAGINE A SKILLED PLAYER COULD CLOSE THINGS OUT QUICKER ALL THAT BEING SAID I CAN'T IMAGINE A GAME TAKING LESS THAN HOURS
WE HAVE HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES THE FIRST GAMES END FASTER BECAUSE NOT ALL PLAYERS PAY THAT CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE WIN CONDITIONS AS WE GOT BETTER THE GAMES ALSO STARTED TAKING A LOT LONGER WHICH IS A BIT OF A SHAME AVERAGE GAME FOR US TAKES HOURS
IF YOU FOCUS ON GETTING DEEDS THE GAME WON'T GO LONG USUALLY A GAME STARTS TO STALEMATE WHEN THE PLAYERS GET INTO A SLAP FIGHT TRYING TO DO STOP THE OTHER FROM WINNING

IF YOU GO FOR DEEDS THEY WILL HAVE AN INCREDIBLY TOUGH TIME TRYING TO SHUT DOWN YOUR WIN CONDITIONS AND THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO WIN THEMSELVES BECAUSE YOU WILL EASILY TIE THEM

DEEDS WIN GAMES OF ANIS
AT MY FAGS THIS SATURDAY WE RAN QUITE A FEW GAMES OF ANIS ALL AT PLAYER COUNTS WITH MINUTES OF RULE EXPLANATIONS THE LONGEST GAME RAN AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH MOST OF THEM CLOCKING IN AT AN HOUR

I THINK THE TRICK IS TO TEACH THE PLAYERS HOW YOU WIN THE GAME BEFORE YOU TEACH THEM HOW TO PLAY THE GAME ANIS CAN STALL VERY QUICKLY IF PLAYERS ARE MEANDERING ACROSS THE MAP AND NOT AGGRESSIVELY SEEKING WIN CONDITIONS IT DEFINITELY SNOWBALLS QUICKLY BUT IT HAS GREAT COMPETITIVE CATCH-UP WHEN I PLAYED I WENT FROM HAVING TWO CLANS AT THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME TO BEING ABLE TO WIN BUT LOSING CAUSE I LOST MY BARONSHIP IN THE LAST MOMENT BY THE END
I REALLY LOVE ANIS BUT I ONLY STARTED LOVING IT AFTER MY THIRD PLAYTHROUGH

THE FIRST TWO SOMEONE WON BY CATCHING THE REST OFF-GUARD THE THIRD PLAYTHROUGH WAS THE FIRST ONE EVERYBODY WAS ON EDGE AND PAYING ATTENTION IT DID TAKE HOURS THOUGH HOWEVER I THINK THAT WAS WITH RULES EXPLANATION AND PEOPLE ONLY PERSHING WIN CONDITIONS AFTER AN INITIAL BUILDUP OF FORCES

YOU SEE I THINK WITH ANIS PEOPLE NEED TO LET GO OF THEIR TRADITIONAL MINDSET AND THIS WILL TAKE A WHILE TO SINK IN I'VE SEEN PEOPLE BUILD UP ALL THEIR CLANS ON ONE AREA USUALLY THE BREN CAPITAL AREA BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID TO BE THE FIRST TO INITIATE A FEUD BUT IN ANIS THE SOONER YOUR CLANS START MINGLING THE FASTER THE GAMES TURNS INTERESTING



SO PERHAPS IT IS BEST THAT YOU ALREADY HINT AT THIS DURING RULES EXPLANATION THE FIRST STALEMATE PART OF THE GAME CAN HOPEFULLY BE AVOIDED THEN
I'VE PLAYED TWICE MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS LIKE YOURS PRETTY SHORT ABOUT AN HOUR I'D SAY REALLY ENJOYED IT

MY SECOND EXPERIENCE LATER THE SAME DAY WITH DIFFERENT PLAYERS WAS SIMILAR A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME BUILDING UP FOLLOWED BY ABOUT MINUTES OF MUNCHKIN LIKE SCRABBLING FOR VICTORY ONE PERSON GETTING A HALF STEP AHEAD ONLY TO BE PULLED BACK I DIDN'T ENJOY THE SECOND PLAY AT ALL

I'M NOT CASTING FINAL JUDGEMENT AFTER 2 PLAYS BUT MAN I'M RELUCTANT TO PLAY IT A THIRD TIME
I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO THROW A CURVE BALL AND SAY ONE OF THE GAMES YOU PLAYED WAS TREKKING THE NATIONAL PARKS
SAD TO HEAR FLEET CAPTAINS COMPONENTS WERE BAD THIS IS SO WIZKIDS WANTED TO GET IT BUT AVAILABILITY IN MY COUNTRY WAS TERRIBLE
FRONTIERS I HAVEN'T TRIED BUT I GOT MAGE KNIGHT LOVE MAGE KNIGHT SO WON'T BE GETTING THE RETHEME

WANT TO GET ASCENDANCY BUT AGAIN AVAILABILITY IN MY COUNTRY IS HORRIBLE GLAD IT WAS GOOD REALLY KNOWS HOW TO TAKE A LICENCE AND MAKE A GOOD GAME

WILL WAIT FOR AS AND WHEN I CAN GET IT
GREAT WRITE UP TOO BAD YOU COULDN'T SQUEEZE IN STAR TREK PANIC I'VE BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT THAT ONE AS WELL
I'M A HUGE AREA CONTROL FAN AND I'VE GOT TO SAY KINGDOM BUILDER IS BARELY AN AREA CONTROL GAME I MEAN SURE YOU ARE TECHNICALLY TRYING TO GET CONTROL OF CERTAIN AREAS ON THE BOARD BUT IT REALLY PLAYS LIKE AN ABSTRACT GAME


DON'T GET ME WRONG I LIKE THE GAME BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE MAYBE CONSIDER THE CLASSIC EL GRANDE IT ISN'T HEAVY AT ALL DON'T BE INTIMIDATED OR FOR SOMETHING MORE RECENT MAYBE SMALL WORLD


IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT KINGDOM BUILDER MAYBE GIVE THE SMARTPHONE APP A WHIRL BEFORE BUYING THE GAME ITS ON SALE I BELIEVE
THIS IS A NATURAL PROGRESSION OF THE BG HOBBY I'VE FOUNDATION

WHAT IS THIS GAME I'VE NEVER HEARD OF YOU MEAN THERE ARE MORE LIKE IT

2 BUY BUY BUY

HEY GUYS I'M NEW TO THE HOBBY BUT HERE IS MY COLLECTION OF GAMES I BOUGHT OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS WHAT ELSE SHOULD I BUY

IS THERE A DICE BASED CARD DRAFTING WORKER PLACEMENT GAME BASED ON THE WORKS OF JANE AUSTIN I THINK THAT'S A HOLE IN THE COLLECTION WE NEED TO FILL JUST IN CASE BUY GAME GROUP WANTS TO PLAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT

HUH I HAVE GAMES STILL IN SHRINK SITTING ON MY SHELF THAT I BOUGHT LAST YEAR AND I'M REALLY HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING SOME OF THESE OTHERS TO THE TABLE WITH MY GROUP THESE DAYS MUST BE TIME FOR

THE PURGE IF IT DOESN'T CHECK OFF THE RIGHT BOXES IN OUR GROUP IT GOES

HUH SO I REALLY ONLY NEEDED GAMES AFTER ALL

YEARS AGO I DID A PURGE SIMILAR TO YOURS AND IN THE END ONLY HAD TO ONE GAME THAT MY WIFE AND I MISSED AFTER A FEW MONTHS NOW WE BUY MAYBE NEW GAMES A YEAR ONCE YOU START GAMING WITH A GROUP THAT STARTS BUYING THEIR OWN GAMES IT BECOMES LESS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE OWNS THE SAME GAMES
YOU KEPT THE TRUMP GAME LOL
YEAH SOMETIMES I THINK ABOUT THROWING AWAY MY COLLECTION AND JUST KEEPING RA AS WELL
WOULD LOVE A BEFORE PHOTO AS WELL HAVE ONE
WHY DID YOU GET RID OF SO MANY GAMES
WHAT IS THE TRUMP GAME
HOW IS GAME OF THRONES IS THAT THE SECOND EDITION OR FIRST
I HAVE NO WORDS
GREAT COLLECTION

I'M THINKING ABOUT DOING A PURGE MYSELF WHAT AVENUES DID YOU USE TO DUMP YOUR GAMES I KNOW I COULD GO CRAIGSLIST EBAY BG MARKETPLACE BUT I AM CURIOUS IF YOU HAD MORE SUCCESS USING ONE PARTICULAR METHOD
I TRY TO KEEP A LOW FOOTPRINT IN EVERYTHING

GET WHAT IS USEFUL AND WHAT IS USED FREQUENTLY
2 IF FINISHED USING AND NOT USING THEM REMOVE

OFTEN I FIND CHEAP SIMPLE THINGS ARE AND EXPENSIVE COMPLEX THINGS ARE 2 EXCEPTIONS ARE THE RARE OFF AND ARE TO BE TREASURED
GLAD TO SEE SONS OF ANARCHY MADE THE CUT A REALLY UNAPPRECIATED GEM
QUICK UPDATE SINCE I ADDED A LINK TO AN OLD IMAGE FILE MONTHS AGO
GETTING RID OF STUFF YOU DO NOT LIKE ANYMORE IS SUPER FREEING YOU DO NOT END UP PLAYING STUFF YOUR FRIENDS LIKE BUT YOU CANNOT STAND ANYMORE
I KNOW ITS ALL PERSONAL CHOICE BUT I FOUND IT FUNNY TO SEE WELCOME TO DUNGEON I JUST TAUGHT MY WIFE THAT GAME TODAY BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO PLAY SOMETHING BEFORE WORK AND ONLY HAD MINUTES WE GOT THAT OUT AND PLAYED IT WITH THE ROOMMATE AFTER A FEW ROUNDS SHE SAYS THIS GAME IS BORING I HATE IT LETS NOT PLAY IT AGAIN AND IT MOVED INTO THE TAKE TO THE FLEA MARKET PILE
WE HAVE BOTH VITICULTURE ESSENTIAL EDITION AND LA GANJA AND REALLY ENJOY BOTH AT
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT GLASS ROAD IT'S QUICKER THAN LOYANG BUT STILL AN ENJOYABLE PUZZLE


HAVEN'T PLAYED LOYANG BUT OWN IT VITICULTURE IS A MEDIUM WEIGHT WORKER PLACEMENT LA GANJA I SOLD AFTER A SINGLE PLAY I COULDN'T SEE THE GAME I WOULD COMPARE LA GANJA TO LUNA WAY BETTER GAME VITICULTURE IS ALSO EXPANDABLE HUGELY BUT THE EXPANSION WILL COST YOU A SIMILAR AMOUNT TO THE BASE BUT IT'S WORTH IT

SO MY PICK IS VITICULTURE
I'VE PLAYED MOST OF ROSENBURG GAMES AND LOVE ALMOST ALL OF THEM I WAS SUPER EXCITED TO TRY LOYANG AT BGGCON THIS YEAR AND WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED OUTSIDE OF THE CUTE VEGGIE MEEDLESS THE GAME IS FAIRLY PLAIN MECHANICS AND STRATEGY WISE

HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT ALL THREE GAMES ARE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT IF I HAD TO RANK THEM I'D PUT VITICULTURE FIRST THEN LA GANJA AS A CLOSE SECOND AND LOYANG AS A FAR DISTANT THIRD

IN RESPONSE TO YOUR EDIT I THINK FIELDS OF ARLE IS PROBABLY ONE OF YOUR BEST BETS FOR A DEEP TWO PLAYER STRATEGY EURO AND I'D PROBABLY RECOMMEND IT OVER ALL THREE OTHER GAMES
I OWN AND LOVE FIELDS OF ARLE BUT IF I HAD TO GET RID OF ONE OF MY ROSENBERGS CAVERN GLASS ROAD FHA IT WOULD BE THIS ALSO IS IT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW NEXT YEAR THERE IS TO BE A DEFINITIVE EDITION OF AGRICOLA TOO MAYBE KEEP AN EYE ON THAT


I ENJOY VITICULTURE BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LIGHTER AND DOES NOT HAVE THE STAYING POWER OF THE ROSENBERG GAMES THE SOLO GAME IS PRETTY GOOD FOR A WHILE THOUGH
I OWN ALL THREE AND NEVER CONSIDERED THEM IN THE SAME PARAGRAPH BEFORE THEY'RE ALL WILDLY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER IF I HAD TO PUT THEM IN A BUY ORDER IT WOULD BE VITICULTURE AT THE GATES OF LOYANG LA GANJA
I CAN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT AT THE GATES OF LOYANG AS I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT I DO OWN THE OTHER TWO
FOR SOME REASON I LIKE LA GANJA A LOT MORE THAN VITICULTURE WHICH STILL IS A GREAT GAME BUT ALSO FEELS A LOT MORE SIMPLE COMPARED TO THE PUZZLE LA GANJA BRINGS TO THE TABLE I JUST GOT TUSCANY LAST WEEK AND HAVE YET TO PLAY IT BUT I HOPE IT WILL SHAKE UP THE GAMEPLAY A LITTLE THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BASE GAME GETS OLD VERY FAST IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE TO NEW PLAYERS AND I WOULDN'T TURN IT DOWN BUT LA GANJA IS JUST SO MUCH MORE MEATIER IN MY OPINION YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF DECISIONS TO MAKE WITH THE CARDS YOU ARE DEALT AND ALL THE MECHANICS FIT SO NICELY TOGETHER THAT IT MAKES FOR A GREAT BRAINBURNING PUZZLE

IT'S PROBABLY MY FAVORITE GAME TO PLAY SOLO AS WELL
SMALL GLASS PREP BOWLS FOR GAMES WITH LOTS OF SMALL PIECES LIKE AGRICOLA I BOUGHT SOME LIKE THESE AT TARGET FOR EACH

A DICE TRAY

POKER CHIPS FOR CERTAIN GAMES SUCH AS FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE
WE BOUGHT A COUPLE OF THOSE BUSINESS CARD HOLDERS THAT HAVE TIERED MULTIPLE SLOTS FOR CARDS FOR USE IN SAVING TABLE SPACE WITH GAMES THAT HAVE LOTS OF DECKS LIKE MARKHAM HORROR AND FIREFLY
SOURCE ONE POCKET DESKTOP CLEAR

DP REF
METAL COINS I OWN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THEMATIC SETS LEGENDARY METAL COINS BY DRAWLAB ARE MY FAVORITE BRAND
MY PIZZA STONE OR CAST IRON PAN YOU CANT LEAVE ALL THE GUESTS HUNGRY AFTER ALL
ANY KIND OF SMALL BOWLS OR RAMEKINS NO FIDDLING WITH PILES OF CHIT

PLANO BOXES FOR THE SAME ISSUE OR A BROKEN TOKEN ORGANIZER IF YOU REALLY LOVE A BIG SET-UP GAME

A DICE CUP SO I CAN ROLL WITHOUT KNOCKING THINGS ABOUT ON THE TABLE
BEER
A DICE TOWER CAN BE FUN ESPECIALLY IF IT'S THEMATIC FOR THE GAME IT CAN LOOK LIKE A CASTLE AND BE USED FOR A MEDIEVAL THEMED GAME FOR EXAMPLE

IF YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO PLAYS GAMES THAT HAVE THE SIDES ARE JUST NUMBERS DICE SOME MORE BEAUTIFUL REPLACEMENTS MIGHT BE NICE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THEY LIKE DICE

IF ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS LIKE HIDDEN ROLE GAMES WITH NIGHT PHASES I'D HIGHLY SUGGEST BUYING THEM A PLAYMAN TO PLAY THEM ON THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENS WHEN EVERYONE'S EYES ARE CLOSED ON SUCH A CUSHY SURFACE TRULY LIFE CHANGING


DICE TRAY
PLANO BOX HIGHLY RECOMMEND
BUSINESS CARD HOLDERS
SET OF DIFFERENT SIZED PLASTIC BAGGIES OR TUCKBOXES IF YOU GOT TIME TO MAKE THEM OPTIONAL DEPENDING ON GAME
A SHORT SMALL TABLE CUP HOLDERS NO FOOD DRINKS ON THE MAIN GAMING TABLE I'D SAY IT'S REQUIRED
COMPONENT UPGRADES ACRYLIC TOKENS TRANSLUCENT DICE ACTUAL GEMS

WET WIPES TO GET RID OF FINGER GREASE

SOME PEOPLE PREFERS DICE TOWER THAN DICE TRAY OVER CONCERNS OF CHEATING I TRUST MY GROUP TO NOT CHEAT AND I PREFERS PHYSICALLY ROLLING THE DICE WITH MY HAND THAN LETTING SOME DICE TOWER DO THAT FOR ME
MY PERSONAL FAVORITES

DICE ARE ALWAYS A GOOD GO I'VE BEEN SPOILED AND AM USED TO EVERY PLAYER HAVING THEIR OWN SET OF DICE THIS ELIMINATES PEOPLE HAVING TO PASS DICE AROUND AND POTENTIALLY KNOCKING STUFF OVER

OF COURSE PASSING DICE AROUND IS A GOOD WAY TO SIGNAL WHO THE ACTIVE PLAYER IS WHICH LEADS ME TO

A CUSTOM FIRST PLAYER MAKER A LOT OF GAMES COME WITH A FIRST PLAYER MARKER SOME OF THESE ARE COOL OTHERS ARE UNWIELDY I'VE DONE AWAY WITH ALL THAT AND MADE MY OWN CUSTOM ONES NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF IDENTIFYING WHICH OF THE TOKENS IN A GAME IS THE ONE FOR THE FIRST PLAYER

GAME MATS ARE ANOTHER GOOD LUXURY ACCESSORY DEPENDING ON YOUR DEFAULT GAMING SURFACE IT MAKES CARDS AND TOKENS EASIER TO PICK UP AND MUFFLES THE SOUND OF DICE ROLLING ON A HARD SURFACE AND PROTECTS SAID SURFACE

A DICE TOWER DICE TRAY MIGHT AS WELL ROLL YOUR DICE IN STYLE AND PREVENT THEM FROM FLYING ACROSS THE ROOM AT THE SAME TIME
WELL THE TABLE OF COURSE

JOKING ASIDE A GOOD TABLE GOES A LONG WAY TO MAKE PLAYING MORE COMFORTABLE HAVING ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE BOARD YOUR OWN LITTLE SPACE AND THEN SOME MORE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HAVING SILLY CUPCAKES CUPS TO PUT YOUR TOKENS IN
ORIGAMI BOXES TO HOLD TOKENS
TINY SUCTION CUPS FOR FANS SOMEONE MENTIONED POKER CHIPS LINE LASER FOR CERTAIN TACTICAL BATTLE GAMES AND I BOUGHT DECK HOLDERS IN DIFFERENT SIZES TO HOLD PLAYER PIECES OR RESOURCES THE LATTER IS CONVENIENT DURING THE GAME TOO OPEN IT UP POUR HALF OF IT INTO COVER AND YOU HAVE 2 BANKS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BOARD
A GAME MAT SO YOU CAN PICK CARDS AND TOKES UP WITHOUT PROBLEMS YOU CAN BUY NEOPRENE MATS QUITE CHEAP ONLINE
DICE TRAY
DICE TOWER
FANCY DICE HUGE POOL TO SELECT FROM
A CARD SHUFFLER I PREFER THE MANUAL ONES
MY FAVORITES

UBERSTAX MODULAR CARD AND CHIT HOLDERS

CARD TRAYS I USE THESE

COUNTER TRAYS I USE THESE

METAL COINS MAKE MANY GAMES ACTIVELY BETTER I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT UNTIL I TRIED IT BUT IT MAKES A SURPRISING DIFFERENCE
STAR TREK FRONTIERS IS BASED OFF MAGE KNIGHT MY NUMBER SOLO GAME OF ALL TIME
APART FROM THEME AND ONE MINOR CONCEPT CHANGE I BELIEVE THE GAME IS THE SAME AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT SUPERB GAMEPLAY THE RULES MAY TAKE LONGER TO DIGEST BUT IT COMES TOGETHER SEAMLESSLY FOR ME AFTER FEW PLAYS
HIGHLY REPAYABLE I RECOMMEND IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU STAR TREK THEME IS OKAY FOR YOU TO NOT HAVE IT GO FOR MAGE KNIGHT BOARD GAME LOST LEGION EXPANSION IS SUPERB

CAN'T COMMENT ON MOM 2ND EDWARD ONLY PLAYED FIRST EDITION BUT I SAW SOME VIDEOS ON GAMEPLAY I'D STILL GO FOR MK
THEMATICALLY AND SCOPE WISE MARKHAM CG COVERS THE SAME GROUND AS MOM SMALL SCALE INTIMATE MYTHOS ACTION OF COURSE MECHANICALLY VERY DIFFERENT

IF YOU REALLY LIKE DECK BUILDING 2 CORES OF THE CG THEN THE CARD GAME IS MUCH MORE NOT DUE TO STORY BUT BECAUSE HOW DIFFERENTLY THE CLASSES PLAY

DESPITE THE ABOVE I DO VERY MUCH ENJOY MOM 2ND EDITION AND WILL BE GETTING THE EXPANSION CONTENTION

I HAPPEN TO LOVE THAT STUFF SO YEAH I GOT ALL THAT PLUS ELDRITCH HORROR MYTHOS TALES EVEN MARKHAM HORROR

WHILE I'VE NOT PLAYED FRONTIERS PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE THE BETTER PATH TO TAKE IF YOU AREN'T A MYTHOS SUPER FAN
WAS IT MIND MAZE
PATHFINDER
UPDATE YOUR WISELIEST

MICE AND MYSTICS


GREAT GAME
YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT ABOVE AND BELOW IT'S NOT TRADITIONAL FANTASY BUT IT REALLY CAPTURES THE STORY TELLING IN A GREAT GAME THE WORLD AND ART IS ICING
IF SHE DOESN'T MIND A GAME WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ACTUAL GAME MECHANICS TALES OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS IS A GOOD SHOUT IT'S PRETTY EASY TO LEARN BECAUSE ITS PRETTY MUCH ALL ABOUT THE STORY AND ADVENTURES
TALES OF ARABIAN NIGHT IS THE BOARD GAME VERSION OF CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE BOOKS IT IS MORE OF AN EXPERIENCE THAN A GAME AND IT OFTEN OFFERS CHAOTIC AND RANDOM ENCOUNTERS BUT I LIKE TO PLAY IT FOR FUN
IS SHE FANTASY HEAVY OR LIGHT LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS A LIGHTER GAME THAT GIVES THE PLAYER LESS IN YOUR FACE CLASSES AND BREAKS IT DOWN TO A EURO CUBES ON A MAP I JUST MADE THAT SHIT UP A LA THIS IS FIGHTERS 2 CLERICS AND A MAGE SOLVING A QUEST VS A CHARACTER SHEET GREAT GAME WITH NO REAL RP INVOLVED BUT YOU CAN MILDLY I SUPPOSE YA BUT I STILL CALL THEM BY THEIR CLASS

I'M JUST STARTING MY COLLECTION BUT I'M HOPING FOR PANDEMIC OR LEGACY AND DEAD OF WINTER
MANSIONS OF MADNESS AS A GIFT AND KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER KS AS A TREAT FROM MYSELF TO ME

POWER GRID I ALWAYS BECOME UNEXPLAINABLY OBSESSED WITH A GAME DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND MY MIND LATCHED ONTO THAT ONE LAST YEAR IT WAS CATAN BECAUSE I WAS JUST GETTING INTO THE HOBBY AND LOOKED FORWARD TO HAVING MY FIRST GATEWAY GAME SO I COULD GET MY FRIENDS INVOLVED

JAMAICA AND IT'S IN THE MAIL
SCYTHE LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ALTHOUGH I AM REALLY HOT FOR TERRAFORMING MARS RIGHT NOW IT JUST LOOKS AND FEELS REALLY GREAT AND I HIGHLY ENJOY THE THEME OF IT BEING ABLE TO COUNTER OTHER PLAYERS IN INDIRECT WAYS BY CRASHING A METEOR ON THE PLANET WHICH SETS OTHERS THINGS ON MOTION AND SO ON SOUNDS REALLY FUN WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE
I KNOW I'M GETTING ISLE OF SKYE ALREADY AND I'M PRETTY PSYCHED ABOUT THAT THE ONE GAME I PLAYED WAS A LOT MORE FUN THAN I EXPECTED

COTTAGE GARDEN AND SPACE CADETS IS WHAT I'D ASK FOR I LIKE BOTH GAMES AND WOULDN'T COMPLAIN IF SOMEONE BOUGHT THEM FOR ME BUT I'M ALSO NOT CRAZY ENOUGH ABOUT THEM TO BUY FOR MYSELF OVER OTHER TITLES

WE JUST GOT SCYTHE TERRAFORMING MARS WONDERS DUEL PANTHEON AND THE CLIMATE EVOLUTION KICKSTARTER COPY RECENTLY SO I'VE ALREADY SPENT MY ALLOTMENT FOR PERSONAL HOLIDAY SPLURGES


IT'S EITHER SCYTHE OR ROOM ULTIMATE EDITION FOR ME
MANSIONS OF MADNESS THOUGH MY DAD IS REALLY BAD AT NOT ASKING OR TELLING ME DISCRETELY SO ITS PRETTY MUCH A GIVEN ITS GONNA BE UNDER THE TREE THIS XMAS
I'M ACTUALLY PUSHING DOWN NEW BOARD GAMES ON MY LIST SINCE I JUST ACQUIRED A GOOD AMOUNT OF NEW ONES BUT HIGHEST IS CURRENTLY TRIESTE
I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET PANDEMIC LEGACY MOSTLY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER BUY IT FOR MYSELF AT THIS POINT AND I THINK IT WILL MOTIVATE SOME OF THE PEOPLE I PLAY WITH TO GET TOGETHER AND PLAY MORE OFTEN ANOTHER ONE WOULD BE TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES GAMES WITH LIMITED REPLACEABILITY THAT I'VE YET TO GAMBLE MY MONEY ON

BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA

MARKHAM HORROR

REX FINAL DAY OF AN EMPIRE

HERE I STAND

TWILIGHT STRUGGLE

CHICAGO EXPRESS
YOU KNOW THE KS EDITION OF SCYTHE ISN'T AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE UNLESS YOU WANT A SECOND HAND VERSION OR EVEN WORSE PAY A SCALPER A PREMIUM

WHAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO IS A DIY KS EDITION AND GET THE BASE AND ALL THE PROMOS EXTRA CARDS DIALS METAL COINS EXTENSION AND REALISTIC RESOURCES FROM EXTERNAL SELLERS LIKE MEEPLESOURCE

THATS PERSONALLY WHAT I'VE DONE ITS COST ME ABOUT TO GET IT ALL TOGETHER BUT WORTH IT FOR MY FAVOURITE GAME OF THE YEAR JUST WISH I WAS ABLE TO GET ON THE KS IN THE FIRST PLACE
PUSHFIGHT EVER SINCE PLAYING IT AT PAX SOUTH THIS YEAR IT'S BEEN AT MY SPOT BUT I CAN'T JUSTIFY THE MONEY AT ANYTIME THIS YEAR
VAST THE CRYSTAL CAVERNS
BASED ON NOTHING OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT I ALMOST BACKED IT AND DIDN'T AND MY FAGS JUST GOT IT IN FIRETEAM ZERO THE BOX IS FREAKING HUGE
VITICULTURE EE OR LORDS OF WATERDEEP EXP
MY PERSONAL WOULD BE ANIS BUT MY GIRLFRIEND AND I LOST A DECENT PORTION OF OUR COLLECTION IN HURRICANE MATTHEW SO I'M DEAD SET ON SURPRISING HER WITH AS MANY REPLACEMENTS AS I CAN FOR CHRISTMAS ANIS CAN WAIT FOR NOW

SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE I'D LOVE ANOTHER GOOD SOLO GAME
NOT SURE I WILL BE ABLE TO GET MY HANDS ON IT IN TIME BUT LORENZO IL MAGNIFICO IS AT THE TOP OF MY HIT LIST
PICKED UP ON BLACK FRIDAY NOTHING MORE EXPECTED FOR CHRISTMAS

FORBIDDEN STARS 2 SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE FORBIDDEN SWAMPS
NUMBER AT THIS POINT MY COPY OF HIGH FRONTIER 3RD EDITION BEING DELIVERED BUT OSS ARES MAGAZINE IS SUCH AN INCOMPETENT COMPANY I SUSPECT PHIL WILL HAVE TO TAKE OVER AND MAKE GOOD ON THE KICKSTARTER INSTEAD

IF THEY'D EVER REPRINT IRON DRAGON I'D BE ALL OVER THAT HECK I'D EVEN TAKE A DECENT USED COPY NOW THAT MY MAP IS DESTROYED ONE OF MY MOST PLAYED GAMES

I WOULD LOVE TO FIND A REASONABLE PRICED COPY OR GIFT COPY OF EITHER AMERICAN MEGAFAUNA WITH EXPANSION S ANTIQUITY OR INFIDEL MEN OF IRON II WRAPPED UP TO BE OPENED BUT THOSE ARE EITHER INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE OR NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ANYMORE

MAYBE A COPY OF GREENLAND 1ST EDITION AND PAX PORFIRIANA 1ST EDITION WOULD BE NICE I DIDN'T LIKE THE ARTWORK FOR GREENLAND AND THE DELUXE BOX IS NOT THE SAME SIZE AS MOST THE OTHER GAMES BUT THEN AGAIN PAX RENAISSANCE CAME IN A BIGGER BOX AND BROKE THE SMALL BOX TREND OF RECENT SIERRA MADRE GAMES TITLES

SO WHAT FLOATS TO THE TOP MY REALISTIC EXPECTATION IS FOR LEAVING EARTH THE OUTER PLANETS OR MAYBE A PRINTPLAYPRODUCTIONS COPY OF THE ARTIFACT HIDDEN INTRUDER AND OR THE LAST FRONTIER MAYBE AGRICOLA MASTER OF BRITAIN OR ANOTHER HOLLANDSPIELE GAME TITLE COULD BE IN THE FUTURE BUT I'LL PROBABLY GO TO WARGAMEVAULT AND BUY PRINT AND PLAY FILES INSTEAD

OOOH OR MAYBE I'LL GET SOME SIERRA MADRE GAMES POSTER MAPS FROM DAZZLE BIOS ORIGINS HIGH FRONTIER INTERSTELLAR AND LORDS OF THE SIERRA MADRE WOULD BE NICE
I'M JUST STARTING MY COLLECTION BUT I'M HOPING FOR PANDEMIC OR LEGACY AND DEAD OF WINTER
I'M JUST STARTING MY COLLECTION BUT I'M HOPING FOR PANDEMIC OR LEGACY AND DEAD OF WINTER

IF IT HELPS BRING YOUR SPIRITS UP OP GET RETAIL SCYTHE AND JUST BUY THE EXTRA KS STUFF OFF WEBSITE WHEN THEY GO UP

WILL COST EXTRA BUT THEY DON'T DO EXCLUSIVES
PROBABLY MANSIONS OF MADNESS OR FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE THEY SEEM INTERESTING BUT I'VE BEEN HESITANT TO GET THEM BECAUSE MUNZ
I'M ASKING FOR SEAWALL BECAUSE I LIKE AND I LIKE LEGACY AND I HAVE ENJOYED SO FAR THE FIRST HALF OF PANDEMIC LEGACY

ALSO MAYBE THE GOONIES ADVENTURE CARD GAME BECAUSE I LITERALLY JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AND I HOPE IT'S GOOD
QUANTUM OR ISTANBUL MAYBE BOTH SOMEWHAT LIGHT SHORT GAMES THAT SCALE WELL AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE PICKED IN A FAMILY THING

EXPANSION 2 ADDS A 6TH PLAYER
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE PLAYED WITH MORE THAN 2 BUT LESS THAN AND NOBODY ELSE WILL BUY TRY DUNGEON RAIDERS IT'S BY THE AUTHOR OF SUSHI GO AND IS A GREAT GAME FOR UP TO PLAYERS
COLT EXPRESS IS A FUN GAME IN MY OPINION PLAYS UP TO AND HAS A GOOD MIX OF STRATEGY AND SIMPLICITY REVEALING THE CARDS AND PLAYING OUT THE ROUND GETS SOME GOOD LAUGHS WITH EVERYONE SHOOTING AND STEALING FROM EACH OTHER PLUS THE 3D TRAIN IS AWESOME
KING OF TOKYO MAYBE
SPLENDOR IS GREAT FOR KIDS IN MY EXPERIENCE AS IS ANY FLAVOR OF SUSHI GO
JUNK ART IS WONDERFUL FUN FOR ALL FAMILIES
WHAT GAMES DIDN'T YOU THINK WERE RIGHT FOR THEM AND WHAT WAS YOUR REASONING WHAT'S AN IDEA FOR THE SORT OF THING THEY MIGHT LIKE
LOONEY QUEST ARUBA
YOU MAY FIND NEUROSHIMA HEX TO BE A GOOD FIT IT'S CERTAINLY A GAME THAT TWO PLAYERS CAN SINK THEIR TEETH INTO

SUMMONER WARS IS ANOTHER EXCELLENT GAME THAT IF YOU DESIRE TO INCLUDES DECK BUILDING TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR ARMY DECK

AND IF YOU WANT SOMETHING WAR LIKE WHY NOT A WAR GAME DO YOU SHARE A COMMON INTEREST OF HISTORICAL TIME PERIOD GMT AND COLUMBIA BOTH MAKE EXCELLENT WARGAMES OVER A VARIETY OF TIME PERIODS I PREFER THE BLOCK GAMES TO THE CHITS BUT BOTH ARE GREAT FUN
IF YOU WANT A GOOD TWO PLAYER WAR GAME THEN YOU MIGHT LOOK AT TWILIGHT STRUGGLE COLD WAR THEMED IF HE LIKES THAT REMINDS ME OF RISK BUT WITH A LOT MORE STRATEGY YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE LOST THE FIRST GAME OR SO BUT ITS ONE OF THOSE GAMES THAT GETS BETTER WITH EACH PLAY AS YOU LEARN NEW STRATEGIES PROBABLY SLIGHTLY HEAVIER THAN THOSE OTHER GAMES BUT THAT WILL HOLD TRUE FOR MOST WAR GAMES

IF YOU WANT A LIGHTER TWO PLAYER GAME THEN MAYBE CHECK OUT HIVE REMINDS ME A BIT OF A MODERN DAY CHESS GAME

IF YOU WANT MORE PLAYERS THEN MAYBE CHECK OUT BLOOD RAGE ITS NOT REALLY A WAR GAME BUT THERE IS SOME COMBAT AREA CONTROL IN IT AND ITS A FUN GAME
I KNOW THESE AREN'T BOARD GAMES SO SORRY ABOUT WRONG SUB BUT I THINK THE JACKBOX PARTY PACK ON PC WORK REALLY WELL FOR THIS KIND OF THING IN MY OPINION THREE IS THE BEST BUT YOU CAN STILL HAVE A TON OF FUN WITH ONE OR TWO
YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO RESISTANCE AVALON
YOU CAN ALSO TRY SECRET HITLER WHICH IS SIMILAR TO RESISTANCE BUT ALSO HAS A FREE PRINT AND PLAY VERSION
SPYFAULT AND SPYFAULT 2 IF IT'S ACTUALLY RELEASED YET COULD BE FUN
MAFIA DE CUBA HERE'S THE SU SD REVIEW

U GETINFO
RESISTANCE COMES STRAIGHT TO MIND

U GETINFO
ASK ANYTHING WORKS VERY WELL IN THESE KINDS OF SITUATIONS WITS AND WAGERS WORK AS LONG AS YOU DONT HAVE A WHY DO I GET ALL THE HARD TASKS FUCK THIS GAME IM NOT PLAYING FRIEND
IF YOU HAVEN'T TRIED WITS AND WAGERS YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD I'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH IT WITH BOTH GAMERS AND ALIKE IT DEFINITELY FITS WITH THE CASUAL PARTY VIBE YOU ARE GOING FOR
I'D RECOMMEND ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF WITH OR WITHOUT THE EXPANSION ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF DAYBREAK

IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES FOR GROUPS FROM TO THE ROUNDS ARE QUICK YOU CAN PLAY WITHOUT A MODERATOR THOUGH IT CAN BE HELPFUL TO HAVE ONE AND IT'S EASY TO LEARN AND TEACH
SKULL CAN BE DONE WITH MAKESHIFT COMPONENTS SPECIFICALLY BEER COASTERS

U GETINFO
MONIKERS IS A PARTY GAME SIMILAR TO CELEBRITIES OR CHARADES BUT WITH A SILLY POP CULTURE TWIST IT'S NOT AGEIST EITHER THERE'S ALSO A FREE PRINT PLAY VERSION UP ON THEIR WEBSITE
IT DOESN'T GO UP TO BUT MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED KING OF TOKYO

I FEEL LIKE YOU COULD MAKE REALLY GOOD DRINKING RULES TO IT AS WELL
SHADOW HUNTERS

UP TO PEOPLE MINIMUM I THINK PROBABLY BEST WITH EACH PLAYER IS GIVEN A CHARACTER EITHER A SHADOW A HUNTER OR A NEUTRAL WITH A SPECIAL POWER AND A SPECIFIC WIN CONDITION NO ONE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE BUT THE HUNTERS WANT TO KILL THE SHADOWS AND THE SHADOWS WANT TO KILL HUNTERS AND THE NEUTRAL HAVE OTHER RANDOM GOALS YOU ROLL SOME DICE COLLECT CARDS AND PUZZLE OUT WHO IS WHO IN ORDER TO ATTACK TO THE RIGHT TARGETS

MY GAMING GROUP LOVES IT
WE LOVE TO PLAY TELESTRATIONS WHEN WE AREN'T IN THE MOOD FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS
DIXIT OR MORE TASK ORIENTED MYSTERIUM ARE FUN AN EASY TO PICK UP UP TO PLAYERS I THINK

CONCEPT IS ALSO LIGHT AND IN THE SAME VEIN

PARADE COCKROACH POKER AND SUSHI GO ARE QUICK CARD GAMES APPROXIMATELY TO MINUTES

ALL THE ABOVE ARE MOSTLY LANGUAGE AGNOSTIC
CASH AND GUNS IS A GOOD PICK FOR A BIG GROUP WHILE DRINKING
IF YOU'RE INTO DECK BUILDING STYLE GAMES I DO ENJOY DOMINION
NOT EXACTLY A BOARD GAME BUT KEEP TALKING AND NOBODY EXPLODES IS PRETTY GREAT
THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS SO OBVIOUSLY TELESTRATIONS MY GROUP UNDER THE SAME SITUATION HAS ALREADY WORE OUT TWO SETS OF MARKERS BEYOND THE FIRST ONES THAT CAME IN THE BOX
DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG
DIXIT IT'S A CLASSIC EASY TO LEARN LITTLE TO NO SETUP SHORT GAMES UNIQUELY FUN
BONANZA IS REALLY GOOD AT THIS AND PLAYS WELL WITH PLAYERS EASY TO LEARN AND PLAY AND INVOLVES ALOT OF TRADING AND TALKING SHIT WITH OTHER PLAYERS AND IT'S SUPER CHEAP
DEAD LAST IS AWESOME FOR THIS SORT OF THING



BASICALLY YOU NEED TO GET A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ON BOARD WITH KILLING SOMEONE WITHOUT THAT PERSON KNOWING SO YOU END UP WINKING HEAD NUDGING WHATEVER IN AN EFFORT TO SUBTLY KILL SOMEONE
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T KEEN ON BLUFFING AND YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE A FAIRLY LARGE GROUP



BASED ON WHAT I'VE PLAYED OWN I THINK THAT DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG COULD WORK WELL IT'S MORE OF A PUZZLE EVERYONE IS TRYING TO WORK OUT BUT SOMEONE AT THE TABLE WILL ALSO BE TRYING TO MISLEAD EVERYONE ELSE NOT TOO FOCUSED ON BLUFFING OUTRIGHT LIES

I ALSO AGREE WITH THE SECRET HITLER RECOMMENDATION BUT YOU LIKE WHAT YOU LIKE AND IF YOU'RE RESISTANT TO BLUFFING THEN I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A GREAT TIME REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU PICK


U GETINFO
GIVE GOOD COP BAD COP A TRY THE GAME IS FUN AND YOU'LL HAVE LOTS OF LAUGHS PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY WANT TO PLAY 2 OR GAMES IN A SITTING
SALEM IS A GREAT GAME FOR A BIG GROUP
BOARDGAME SALEM

GET TWO RED DRAGON INN SETS UP TO


MASCARADE WORKS WELL WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE AND I'VE TESTED IT WITH BEER WORKS GREAT
KING OF TOKYO IS GREAT WITH A BIT OF BOOZE AXES OUT AT PLAYERS BUT GOES FAST ENOUGH MIN THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE TURNS PLAYING
SPYFAULT IS A GREAT GAME FOR TO PEOPLE PLAYING AT THE THE GAME IS QUICK EASY AND ENOUGH TO PLAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN
RED DRAGON INN IS A PRETTY FUN GAME ALTHOUGH THE THEME MIGHT NOT FIT FOR ALL PEOPLE WHICH REALLY SETS A SOCIAL ATMOSPHERE WITH THE WAY THE GAME IS SET UP MAKE SURE TO BRING TONS OF DRINKS TO THE TABLE IF YOU DECIDE TO GO WITH THIS ONE

THERE ARE SEVERAL PRICED VERSIONS OF THE GAME WHICH JUST INCLUDES DIFFERENT CHARACTER DECKS IF YOU'RE GONNA BE PEOPLE I'M SURE YOU COULD GO WITH THE MODERATELY PRICED BASE GAME
THE RESISTANCE GOOD FOR UP TO PLAYERS SIMPLE RULES
EXPLODING KITTENS AND ANOMIA ARE PRETTY FUN
CITADELS EASY TO LEARN PORTABLE BOX IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THREE CARD DECKS AND HAS SOME DEPTH FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WITH MORE STRATEGY SETUP TIME IS ALSO REALLY QUICK SO HAS A GOOD DEPTH SETUP TIME RATIO

IT HAS SIMILAR FEELING TO HIDDEN ROLE GAMES WITHOUT REQUIRING BLUFFING AS IT IS ALL ABOUT WHAT CHARACTER CARD YOU CHOOSE FOR THE ROUND
CODENAMES IS ANY NUMBER BUT THAT'S THE SWEET SPOT EVERYONE I'VE SHOWN LIKES IT AND IT'S EASY TO PLAY IF 2 OF YOU KNOW THE RULES

NO ONE'S GETS ELIMINATED DURING PLAY

NUMBER ONE PARTY GAME ON BG
RESISTANCE AND COUP ARE MY GO TO PARTY GAMES THAT OR CATEGORIES
BAND IS AMAZINGLY FUN WHEN DRINKING IT ADDS ANOTHER LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY
MONIKERS IS MY VOTE
PERHAPS SPYFAULT WOULD WORK IN THIS SITUATION I CONSIDER GOOD COP BAD COP A PARTY DEDUCTION GAME CONSIDER IT ALSO

FINALLY LOOK INTO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS GETTING GOOD REVIEWS

THESE ALL MAX AT HOWEVER

ALSO NOT STRICTLY A PARTY GAME BUT AVENUE PLAYS TONS OF PEOPLE AND IT'S VERY FUN AND LIGHT

I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND SECRET HITLER AND CA H N GUNZ IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WHY YOU ONLY NEED ASK
IT'S A GOOD GAME EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE THE SETUP OF IT CREATES AN INTERESTING PUZZLE THAT'S FAIRLY UNIQUE DIFFERENT DOCTORS DIFFERENT ROOM EFFECTS AND THE CUBE BAG MANAGEMENT IS AN INTERESTING MECHANIC BUT IT ULTIMATELY BOILS DOWN TO THE SAME GAME EVERY TIME EVERYONE I'VE INTRODUCED IT TO HAS ENJOYED IT BUT NO ONE ACTIVELY LOOKS TO PLAY IT AGAIN

RADIO HAS A GOOD RUN-THROUGH OF THE GAME MECHANICS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

MY ONLY REAL GRIPE IS THE VICTORY POINT GAMES PRODUCTION QUALITY AND THE FACT THE BOARD IS BASICALLY A CONSTRUCTION PAPER SHEET I THINK YOU CAN GET A REAL BOARD AS AN UPGRADE NOW AN UPGRADE
IN MY MIND QUANTUM FEELS QUITE UNIQUE BEING ABLE TO RECONFIGURE YOUR SHIP IS REALLY FUN
FROM MY COLLECTION

ALCHEMISTS IT IS EXTRAORDINARY GAME BECAUSE OF VARIOUS THINGS COMBINATION OF WORKER PLACEMENT AND DEDUCTION 2 INTEGRATING APP SMOOTHLY INTO THE GAME THE THEME HITS HOME WITH ACADEMIA FOLKS PUBLISH OR PERISH

DUNGEON PETZ THE NEEDS AND HOW TO APPEASE THEM ARE VERY UNIQUE AND THEMATIC

MACHS VS MINIONS IS VERY THEMATIC PLAYING IT IS LIKE PLAYING A VIDEO GAME WHERE YOU LEVEL UP AND EVERYTHING IT ALSO WITH REGARD TO ITS PRODUCTION VALUE AND RELATIVELY LOW PRICE

TALES OF ARABIAN NIGHT SURE THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER GAMES WHICH INTEGRATE STORY TELLING INTO THE GAME BUT COAN IS THE STORY GAME THAT RULE THEM ALL IT'S MORE OF AN EXPERIENCE THAN A GAME TSH


OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

CAPTAIN SONAR
RAMPAGE TERROR IN STEEPLE CITY

ICE COOL
AS A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME I THINK DUNGEON PETZ CERTAINLY FITS THE NOT LIKE THE OTHERS CRITERIA ON BOTH THE THEME AND OVERALL RULE SET

AS FOR ACTION POINT ALLOWANCE AREA INFLUENCE I THINK LUNA BY STEFAN FELD IS PRETTY DIFFERENT ESPECIALLY IN ITS THEME

BLUE MOON LEGENDS IS ALSO QUITE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON HAND MANAGEMENT I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE SWITCH IN POV THAT THE CARDS USE REQUIRING PLAYERS TO READ THE CARD EFFECTS OUT LOUD
ANY GAME FORM SIERRA MADRE GAMES UNIQUE COMBINATION OF EDUCATION AND GAMES

LEAVING EARTH IS ALSO UNIQUE
STRING RAILWAY COMES TO MIND IT'S MINUTES OF RIDICULOUS FUN
CATACOMBS EITHER IT'S THE ONLY DUNGEON CRAWLER THAT INVOLVES FLICKING DISCS OR IT'S THE ONLY DEXTERITY GAME THAT INVOLVES CASTING SPELLS
FIVE TRIBES IS PRETTY UNIQUE MECHANICALLY AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THE MANCALA ACTION IS REALLY ABSTRACT BUT IT IS A REALLY SATISFYING THING WHEN YOU CAN MAKE A MOVE IN A TRICKY WAY TO SET YOURSELF UP FOR A GOOD FOLLOW UP MOVE BY DROPPING THE RIGHT MEEDLESS IN THE RIGHT PLACES ON YOUR WAY TO YOUR CURRENT GOAL

ALSO RECENTLY PICKED UP SNOW TAILS AND IT'S DEFINITELY THE MOST UNIQUE RACING GAME I HAVE YOU HAVE TO PLAY CARDS TO MANIPULATE YOUR SLEDGE'S DRIFT AND SPEED SO YOU DON'T WRECK BUT STILL CROSS THE FINISH LINE FIRST

CHANCES ARE YOU'LL NEVER PLAY WITH BOTH SIDEBOARDS

THE SIDEBOARDS ARE ONLY USED IF YOU USE THE ANCIENT ONE WHOSE SET UP INSTRUCTIONS TELL YOU TO SET UP THE SIDEBOARD OR IF YOU DRAW THE PROLOGUE CARD THAT TELLS YOU TO SET UP THE SIDEBOARD OTHERWISE YOU DON'T PLAY WITH EITHER SIDEBOARD

TO PLAY WITH BOTH YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE PLAYING WITH THE ANCIENT ONE THAT NEEDS ONE SIDE BOARD AND YOU DREW THE PROLOGUE THAT REQUIRED THE OTHER IN THAT CASE IF YOU DIDN'T FEEL LIKE PLAYING WITH BOTH YOU COULD EASILY REDRAW THE PROLOGUE CARD
A CMC WITH GAMES IN YEAR HTTPS
AS FAR AS I LOVE SHELTIES OF BOARD GAME COLLECTIONS DAMN YOU REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS AS A PROBLEM PRODUCTS WITHIN YEAR MAKES OVER GAMES PER MONTH YOU TECHNICALLY BUY A GAME EVERY 3RD DAY THAT'S A LOT MANUAL ALL IS FINE IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY FOR IT EVERYTHING IS FOR THE PEOPLE AS WE SAY IN POLAND BUT STILL MAKES ME THINK
MY SONS AND I USED TO PLAY A TON OF CAVE TROLL I HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF THAT ONE AND MIGHT HAVE TO GET IT OUT AGAIN SOON




HA I SEE MECANISBURGO IN THERE THAT GAME IS BARASHIT CRAZY

WOW FEROX AS WELL THAT WOULD BE A NUTTY WEEKEND






SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TO THE HOBBY FIRSTLY YOU SHOULD CHECK THE SIDEBAR FOR ALL IMPORTANT THINGS ALSO BE SURE TO CHECK OUT BOARDGAMEGEEK WHICH IS BASICALLY THE CENTRAL HUB OF ALL THINGS BOARD GAMES


DIFFICULT TO RECOMMEND ANYTHING BASED SOLELY ON WHAT YOU'VE GIVEN BUT CHECKING THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW FOLKS ON THE SIDEBAR IS A GREAT PLACE TO START
CODENAMES IS A PARTY GAME BUT DON'T LET FOOL YOU FOR ITS PRICE YOU'RE GETTING A REALLY GOOD GAME


NO PROBLEM MANUAL IF YOU LIKE THE IDEA OF RISK HAVE A LOOK AT EMET OR CYCLADES OR EVEN GAME OF THRONES ALL OF WHICH ARE BETTER MODERN VERSIONS OF THE SAME DUDES ON A MAP IDEA
SOUNDS LIKE A NEW GAMER TO ME

FIRST OFF YOU SAY YOU WANT A COMPLEX OR SKILLED GAME AND THEN MENTION RISK WHILE A GREAT PIECE OF HISTORY RISK IS ABOUT AS SIMPLE A GAME AS YOU CAN PLAY IT'S ALSO REALLY UNFUR COMPARED TO SOME NEWER OPTIONS SO IF YOURE NEW TO BOARD GAMES BE CAREFUL ASKING FOR REALLY COMPLEX ONES BECAUSE THAT HOLE GOES VERY DEEP LOL

HERE IS THE DICE LIST OF GREAT GIFT GAMES FOR THE HOLIDAYS THAT WILL BE A GREAT PLACE TO START
IF YOU THINK RISK SOUNDS GREAT BUT DON'T LIKE LUCK DICE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH SMALLSWORD GIVE IT A SHOT

LIKE OTHERS HERE I'D SAY THAT WHILE VERY FAMOUS RISK IS NOT A VERY GOOD GAME AND BOARDGAMES HAVE EVOLVED SINCE CONCEPTION RISK IS NOT A COMPLEX GAME BY MODERN STANDARDS JUST BE CONSCIOUS OF THIS WHEN YOU GO SHOPPING THERE ARE SOME REALLY COMPLEX GAMES OUT THERE

YOU COULD OFCOURSE LOVE THEM I SURE DID WHEN I DISCOVERED THERE IS MORE THAN MONOPOLY RISK CATAN IN THE WORLD BUT PERHAPS TRY BEFORE YOU BUY
BANG

THERE I SHOT YOU
I WOULD RECOMMEND LORDS OF THE WATERDEEP EXPANSION ITS HARD TO MISS WITH THAT ONE
I WOULD START WITH TICKET TO RIDE OR CARCASSONNE BOTH ARE FUN AND PRETTY EASY TO PICK UP
RISK OR GAME OF THRONES BOARD GAME IF YOU LIKE THE THEME
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT BOARD GAMES IN GENERAL ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN YOU THINK THOSE MASS MARKET CLASSIC GAMES YOU KNOW ARE ABOUT NEWER BOARD GAMES ARE GONNA COST USUALLY

IT'S ALSO GOING TO TAKE A FEW MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU LIKE SINCE YOU ARE NEW I WOULD RECOMMEND SOME GREAT LIGHTER NOT AS COMPLEX GAMES FOR YOU WOULD BE ANY OF THESE WOULD BE A GOOD STARTING POINT AND THEY'RE ALL GREAT FUN

TICKET TO RIDE

CATAN

THE RESISTANCE DYSTOPIAN THEME AVALON FOR THE KING ARTHUR THEME

CODENAMES

LORDS OF WATERDEEP CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD

EL GRANDE RISK LIKE IN THAT ITS AN AREA CONTROL GAME



ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THAT YOU SAID I WANT TO GET SOME BOARDGAMES FOR THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS THEN PROCEEDED TO I LOVE COMPLEX OR SKILLED GAMES

YOU DON'T GIVE GIFTS THAT ARE WHAT YOU LIKE BUT WHAT THE GIFTED WILL LIKE THIS IS A VERY HARD LESSON TO LEARN WITH BOARD GAMES AS THERE IS A HUGE RANGE OF AVAILABLE GAMES DOMINANT SPECIES MAY BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES BUT IT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE GIFT FOR A FAMILY MEMBER

FOR FAMILY MEMBERS I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND SPLENDOR BONANZA CV CARCASSONNE AND QWIRKLE

THE GAMES I AM GIFTING TO FAMILY THIS HOLIDAY ARE
LAS VEGAS
UNUSUAL SUSPECTS
CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG
DR EUREKA
CLICK CLACK LUMBERJACK
RHINO HERO
ZANY PENGUINS
DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG
CIVILIZATIONS

I'VE DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON THESE BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED THEM YET BUT THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN EACH WAS WHAT THE RECIPIENT WOULD ENJOY MOST NOT WHAT I WOULD ENJOY MOST


PS FOR ANYONE CONCERNED NONE OF MY RECIPIENTS REDDIN SO NO DANGER IN POSTING THE LIST




I ABSOLUTELY LOVE COSMIC ENCOUNTER I HAD A GROUP I PLAYED IT WITH RELENTLESSLY BUT WHEN PLAYING WITH OTHER GAME GROUPS IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO FALL FLAT SO FLAT THAT I AM ON THE BRINK OF SELLING MY COPY I ATTRIBUTE IT TO NEW COMERS JUST NOT PROPERLY UNDERSTANDING HOW INVITING EVERYONE BENEFITS YOU MORE THEN THEM EVEN IF I TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT WITH MYFIRST GROUP WE PLAYED IT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE GAME WORKS IN THAT WAY THESE DAYS IT'S BUSY THE ONE AND DONE PLAY MENTALITY
MAYBE JUST PLAY SOMETHING ELSE FOR A WHILE OR DON'T PLAY CE WHEN THAT OUTSIDE FRIEND IS THERE LOOKING FOR SIMILAR GAMES WON'T HELP WITH THAT NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO CLEANSE THE PALATE
THEY SAID IN THE LATEST EMAIL THAT THERE IS A WAIT LIST SO IF YOU WANT TO BE ADDED TO IT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY SHOOT THEM AN EMAIL
I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THIS TOO
GREAT START

LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD STAND TO THIN YOUR PAINTS FURTHER THAN YOU CURRENTLY ARE THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE MAIN ISSUE ALL BEGINNER PAINTERS HAVE

CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD
CYCLADES
COSMIC ENCOUNTERS


YOU LISTED QUITE A BROAD RANGE OF GAMES SO IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO TRY TO FURTHER SPECIFY WHAT IT IS THAT YOU LIKE ABOUT THE GAMES THAT BEING SAID HERE ARE A FEW SUGGESTIONS

K2 MOUNTAINEERING HAVEN'T TRIED THE EXPANSION YET BUT I THINK IT WOULD MAKE IT EVEN BETTER

MINUTE EMPIRE LEGENDS SMALL AREA CONTROL GAME

CUTTHROAT CAVERNS FUN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BACKSTABBING



SOME OF THESE ARE ONLY BUT I'D RECOMMEND ANY OF THEM FOR YOUR GROUP

COLLECTION USER TASMAN
SCYTHE
TYRANTS OF THE UNDERMARK
ECLIPSE ROLL FOR THE GALAXY
I WAS EXPECTING MORE I HEARD HYPE COMING FROM BGGCON BUT AFTER THIS REVIEW IT'S A HARD PASS FOR ME
LOOKS FUN I MIGHT PICK IT UP AT SOME POINT I'LL DEFINITELY TRY TO PLAY IT IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY
R BOARDGAMES COMMENTS
THIS SAME QUESTION WAS POSTED HOURS AGO
SEEMS LIKE A FINE COLLECTION

I GUESS YOU LIKE MEDIUM LENGTH 2 HOUR OR SMALL CONFLICT GAMES

I'M GUESSING YOU FIND GAMES LIKE GAME OF THRONES 2ND ED ECLIPSE OR CIVILIZATION A BIT MORE OR SLIGHTLY LONGER GAMES LAST TOO LONG OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY ONE OF THOSE

ALSO YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY TRAITOR GAME COULD BE NICE TO MIX IT UP RESISTANCE SECRET HITLER DEAD OF WINTER BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA WHICHEVER YOU LIKE SOME PEOPLE HATE THIS CATEGORY BUT I THINK IT'S NICE TO MIX IT UP

GENERALLY I FIND IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST PEOPLE GAMES BASED ON THEIR LIST THOUGH IN GENERAL THIS SORT OF PROBLEM IS QUITE DIFFICULT NETFLIX HAVE SPEND TONS TO IMPROVE THEIR SUGGESTION ALGORITHM AND MOST PEOPLE CAN AGREE IT GIVES LUDICROUS SUGGESTIONS OFTEN

FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR LIST I DON'T REALLY SEE ANYTHING COHERENT WHAT YOU LIKE MEDIUM WEIGHT MEDIUM LENGTH A BIT MORE THEME AND LOOKS AND SOME INTERACTION I SUPPOSE BUT SO MANY GAMES FIT THAT EL GRANDE POWER GRID BRASS TZOLKIN KEYFLOWER TERRAFORMING MARS ORLEANS CONCORDIA VITICULTURE EMET MOMBASA NATIONS VILLAGE THESE ALL MIGHT BE GAMES YOU MIGHT LIKE NO IDEA THOUGH IF YOU REALLY WANT MORE INSIGHTFUL HELP YOU NEED TO TELL WHY YOU LIKE SOME GAMES AND PERHAPS MAKE A BG PROFILE WITH ALL YOUR GAMES ALSO THOSE YOU DON'T OWN RATED
BETRAYAL STORED ON ITS SIDE RISKY
IT IS BEAUTIFUL
NICE

I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE DISPLAY CASE FOR THE MINIS I TRIED TO GET SOMETHING SIMILAR PAST THE WIFE BUT FAILED MY PERSUADE ROLL
NICE COLLECTION
NICE COLLECTION MINIS TOO LOVE IT
BOARDGAME
SCYTHE TERRA MYSTIC CAVERN AND KEYFLOWER ARE SOME OF OUR FAVORITES TO PLAY WE ALSO RECENTLY PICKED UP BLOOD RAGE AND FIND IT INTERESTING PANDEMIC LEGACY I PERSONALLY CANT STAND OUR GROUP IS AT MONTHS AND I DON'T SEE US FINISHING IT ANY TIME SOON IS CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD TOO SIMPLE I WOULD SUGGEST TRYING OUT THE ALLERGIST IF YOU WANT A HEAVY GAME WITH BEAUTIFUL COMPONENTS I AM INTERESTED IN LOOKING INTO STATE
LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF OVERLAP IN OUR FAVORITE GAMES I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR MORE ABOUT LOST VALLEY

I OWN IT BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO PUSH IT TO THE FRONT OF THE PLAYLIST
HEY A COUPLE OF FRIENDS AND I ARE GOING THROUGH THE TOP GAMES WE HAVE ACCESS TO ON BBB WE PLAY THEM THEN WE EACH RATE THAT SINGLE EXPERIENCE OUT OF FIVE AND END UP WITH A RUNNING ORDER OF GAMES WE HAVE PLAYED WE STILL HAVE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN OUR LIST SCYTHE BLOOD RAGE ECT BUT HERE ARE OUR TOP GAMES THAT WE COLLECTIVELY GAVE A RATING OF OR HIGHER I KNOW SOME OF THESE ARE GAMES YOU OWN AND OTHERS YOU HAVE PROBABLY TRIED BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE THAT WAY YOU KNOW WHAT KINDS OF GAMES WE LIKE ANYWAY HERE IT IS HOPE THIS HELPS CASTLES OF BURGUNDY
ECLIPSE
CODENAMES
POWER GRID
SHOGUN
DIE MACHER
TERRA MYSTIC

WHAT STANDS OUT AS MISSING PROBABLY BECAUSE I JUST GOT IT IS TERRAFORMING MARS

OTHER GAMES YOU MIGHT LIKE AND I DON'T SEE ORLEANS MOMBASA
OH I LIKE THE WHOLE THING NICE COLLECTION TOO I LOVE THE GLASS CASE THING HAVE SOMETHING SIMILAR FOR MY AS WELL
SO BEAUTIFUL MY COLLECTION IS ONE OR TWO GAMES OFF FROM YOURS BUT I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT THE BEST WAY TO STORE AND DISPLAY THEM YET THIS IS A MARVELOUS IDEA
WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH ISLE OF SKYE
ANYWAY THATS LIKE AN AVERAGE OF GAMES A MONTH SAD WITH ENVY HAHA
IM TRYING TO LIMIT MYSELF TO OR SO GAMES A YEAR NOW
AWESOME COLLECTION AND LOVE THE STAR WARS MINI FIGURINES RECENTLY GOT BLOC BY BLOC AND I'M A HUGE FAN GAMES LAST AROUND 2 HOURS I RECOMMEND IT BUT I'M RELATIVELY NEW TO THE HOBBY I'D DESCRIBE IT AS SIMILAR IN PLAY TO PANDEMIC BUT WITH A VARIABLE BOARD
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON CAVERN
HE JUST BLASTED RIGHT INTO THE FACTIONS GOALS HE SHOULD START A LITTLE LIGHTER WITH BROAD STROKES DESCRIBING THE BOARD AND MECHANICS EVENTUALLY GETTING TO THE NITTY GRITTY WHEN IT SEEMS NATURAL ALSO SHOW US SOME VISUALS THE BOARD CARDS WHATEVER SO PEOPLE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT ANYWAY GOOD LUCK TO HIM
HERO QUEST
YOURS LOOKS IN GREAT CONDITION MY BROTHER FOUND OUR COPY AND THE EXPANSIONS FROM HOME LATE LAST YEAR
I KIND OF REPEAT MYSELF HERE BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT WORK WITH THIS LIST EVERY WEEK


THE MYTHIC BATTLES PANTHEON IS ENDING SOON AND I WILL MISS THIS CAMPAIGN THE COMMUNITY THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD UP THANKS TO THE WAY THEY ARE COMMUNICATING WITH LIVE STREAMS AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENT SECTION FOR HOURS PER DAY IS VERY IMPRESSIVE


TO ME THE GAMEPLAY LOOKS EASY TO LEARN AND TEACH OTHERS AND QUICK ENOUGH SO YOU DO NOT GET MUCH DOWNTIME IT IS COOL THEY HAVE HAVE ADDED SCENARIOS THAT ALLOWS BOTH CO-OP AND SOLO PLAY SOMETHING I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE ADDED FROM THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN AS THAT CAN BE A DEAL BREAKER FOR MANY


THE MODELS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL AND I DO LIKE HOW A NORMAL HUMAN LOOKS SO SMALL NEXT TO SOME MONSTERS AND THE GODS AND THE GODS LOOKS SMALL WHEN COMPARED TO THE TITANS


YESTERDAY THEY REVEALED THE LAST EXPANSION RISE OF THE TITANS IF PAINTING HUGE MONSTERS IS A THING YOU ENJOY THEN YOU SHOULD REALLY CHECK THAT ONE OUT


OH AND WITH THE CONAN MYTHIC BATTLES CROSSOVER THE CONAN FANS CAN FINALLY GET THEIR WINGED APE


ALL IN ALL MYTHIC BATTLES PANTHEON IS THE GAME I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOST RIGHT NOW OF ALL THE BOARDGAMES I HAVE BACKED NOW TO WAIT FOR ONE YEAR
WHAT'S THE RECORD FOR FUNDS RAISED ON A BOARD GAME AND WHAT ARE THE CHANCES KD M BREAKS IT
SHUFFLE ROLL AND GIVE THANKS FOR GAMES AND THOSE YOU PLAY THEM WITH
SINCE BOTH FEUDUM AND VAST THE CRYSTAL CAVERNS BOTH WILL COME TO RETAIL I'M THINKING ABOUT DROPPING MY FEUDUM PLEDGE TO GET LISBOA KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER LOOKS AMAZING BUT I COULD GET AT LEAST FIVE OTHER GAMES FOR PLUS SHIPPING MAYBE I SHOULD GET TWO COPIES OF IT AND SELL ONE

DO YOU THINK THERE WILL STILL BE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BUY IT ONCE THIS KICKSTARTER IS OVER
NOT SURE IF I SHOULD DROP MY MYTHIC BATTLE PLEDGE AS IM NOW MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN ADM I COULD GET BOTH BUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MYTHIC WILL ACTUALLY BE A FUN GAME
ONLY BACKING LEGENDS UNTOLD CURRENTLY WITH TINY EPIC QUEST FINISHING A FEW HOURS AGO REALLY INTERESTING CARD BASED RPG THAT IS SMASHING ITS STRETCH GOALS AND STILL HAS NEARLY WEEKS TO GO MY ONLY CONCERN IS THEY BECOME TOO WELL FUNDED AND FEEL FORCED TO PRODUCE ENDLESS STRETCH GOALS WHICH CAN BE DAMAGING FOR THESE SMALLER DEVELOPERS AS THEIR GAME ESCALATES AWAY FROM THEM THEY SEEM TO HAVE A SENSIBLE THREAD ON THINGS AT THE MOMENT THOUGH WITH A STORY BASED CAMPAIGN MODE JUST HAVING BEEN UNLOCKED
I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN BACKING VAST THE CRYSTAL CAVERNS AFTER SKIPPING THE FIRST KICKSTARTER I'M KIND OF UNSURE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF EXPLAINING THE GAME TO OTHER PLAYERS SINCE EVERYONE IS DOING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING MY MAIN GROUP PLAYS A LOT OF HEAVY GAMES SO IT MIGHT NOT BE A PROBLEM FOR THEM BUT COULD BE FOR NEWER GAMERS
I ONLY READ THESE FOR THE I'M GLAD TO SEE SOMEONE'S FINALLY HAD THE BALLS TO MAKE AN OFFENSIVE GAME WE'VE REALLY BEEN WAITING FOR THAT
I NOTICED VAST THE CRYSTAL CAVERNS GETS A REPRINT TAG SHOULDN'T KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER THEN ALSO GET ONE
I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THE EDGE DOWNFALL BUT THEN I SWITCHED TO MB AND WANTED TO GET THE TYPHOON PLEDGE NOW I'VE LOWERED IT TO GET THE CORE BOX TITANS EXPANSION AND I WENT FOR KD M AS MY HIGHEST PLEDGE I JUST HOPE THEY STICK WITH THE CORE GAME BEING SHIPPED ON SUMMER
JUST MY OPINION BUT DOESNT DUNGEON SEEMS TO BE TOO LIGHT IN GAMEPLAY

GRANTED THE ART IS JUST AWESOME
DOES ANYONE WANT TO COMPARE MINUTE DUNGEON TO FUSE
I WISH I HAD THE TO DROP ON KD MASCULINE IT LOOKS AMAZING BUT I JUST CAN'T
THINKING OF GETTING A REFUND ON MY DARK SOULS BOARD GAME KICKSTARTER PLEDGE BECAUSE OF ADM THOUGHTS
I WENT IN AT THE LANTERN PLEDGE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN BLUEBELLED BY THE AMAZING PAINT JOBS ON THESE MODELS SINCE I DON'T REGRET A THING
THANKS U ZELBINIAN FOR THE GREAT WORK EVERY WEEK

WE ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED ON KICKSTARTER AND ENDING OUR CAMPAIGN IN HOURS CHECK US OUT HERE

THANKS SO MUCH EVERYONE FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND LOVE OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS THIS WAS OUR FIRST PRODUCT KICKSTARTER AND WE ARE EXCITED TO BRING LAUGHTER INTO PEOPLE'S LIVES


I'M INTERESTED IN VAST AND LISBOA BUT WITH KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER BEING AVAILABLE FOR PLEDGES I CAN'T JUSTIFY ALL OF THEM I SOLD SOME STUFF OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS TO PREP FOR THE ADM KS AND NOW THAT IT'S HERE I'VE PLEDGED FOR THE LEVEL BUT WE'LL SEE HOW I FEEL AS THE CAMPAIGN NEARS IT'S END THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR A GAME ESPECIALLY WHEN MY SHELF IS ALREADY FULL OF STUFF I KNOW I LIKE
WHAT ABSOLUTELY KILLS ME ABOUT KINGDOM DEATH IS THE RELEASE DATE I'M NEW TO THIS HOBBY AND THE IDEA OF DROPPING ON A SINGLE GAME IS DAUNTING BUT I COULD BE CONVINCED IF THE GAME IS WORTH IT WHICH EVERYTHING I'VE READ SAYS IT IS

BUT SPENDING THAT KIND OF CASH FOR A GAME I WON'T HAVE FOR YEARS SEEMS RIDICULOUS

EDIT APPEARS I NEED TO READ MORE LOL THANKS
TINY EPIC QUEST HAS COPIED SO MUCH OF ITS STYLE FROM THE ZELDA FRANCHISE I WOULD THINK IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THEY GET CONTACTED BY LAWYERS TO CHANGE THEIR ARTWORK OR GET SUED PRETTY BALLSY OF THEM
MICE MYSTICS SOUNDS PERFECT IT'S A DUNGEON CRAWLING RPG AIMED AT A YOUNGER AUDIENCE AND ENTRY LEVEL GAMERS BUT STILL ENJOYABLE FOR EVERYONE ELSE THE EVIL IS CONTROLLED BY THE GAME TOO SO YOU CAN ENJOY CONQUERING IT TOGETHER
YOU WON'T FIND ANYONE RECOMMENDING MONOPOLY IN HERE ALSO PRETTY MUCH ALL OUR GAMES ARE NERDY NO NEED TO DEFINE A GAME AS NERDY THEY'RE ALL NERDY AND YOU SOUND LIKE ONE OF US WELCOME
BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT BASICALLY IT'S ABOUT A BUNCH OF PEOPLE EXPLORING A HAUNTED HOUSE IN MOST LIKELY SOMEONE WILL BECOME A TRAITOR

NOTE THAT THERE'S A NEW EXPANSION JUST OUT WALK I HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT TOO
YOU MIGHT LOOK AT SOME OF THE D D BOARD GAMES LIKE CASTLE RAVENLOFT OR WRATH OF ASHARDALON OR LEGEND OF DRIZZIT

YOU MIGHT ALSO LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE DESCENT 2ND ED OR IF STAR WARS IS AN ACCEPTABLE THEME THEN THE REIMPLEMENTATION OF THE DESCENT SYSTEM IMPERIAL ASSAULT

THE D D GAMES ARE FULLY COOPERATIVE WHILE THE DESCENT GAMES ARE MEANING ONE PLAYER WILL PLAY THE BAD GUYS WHILE THE REST OF THE PLAYERS PLAY THE HEROES

EDIT FORGOT TO SAY ALL THESE GAMES ARE SUPER NERDY
SETTLERS OF CATAN MAY BE GOING MAINSTREAM BUT IS REALLY GOOD I REALLY LIKE CASTLE PANIC DUE TO ITS COOPERATIVE RULESET
MAYBE MARVEL LEGENDARY IT IS CO-OP AGAINST EVIL VILLAINS SO SOUNDS LIKE PLAYING WITH MY SONS AGAINST THE EVIL
HEY SHOUT OUT TO A FELLOW ELFQUEST FAN I ALMOST NEVER SEE ANOTHER ONE IN THE WILD BY THE WAY THERE WAS AN ELF QUEST GAME ON KICKSTARTER A WHILE BACK I GOT IT IT'S TERRIBLE

AS I HAVE BEEN FOR MANY PEOPLE LOOKING AT THIS CATEGORY OF GAMES LATELY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE NEW CONAN GAME NOT ONLY IS IT THE MOST FUN HACK AND SLASH GAME OUT THERE IT WORKS FOR A SMALLER NUMBER OF PLAYERS SINCE ONE PERSON CAN PLAY MANY HEROES EASILY I THINK CONAN IS SUFFICIENTLY NERDY PLUS YOU AND YOUR SON COULD SPEND TIME PAINTING THE MINIATURES TOGETHER I WOULD DEFINITELY GIVE IT A LOOK AS IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU MAY BE LOOKING FOR
ALL THE SUGGESTIONS ARE GREAT

I'D LIKE TO MENTION LORDS OF WATERDEEP GREAT WORKER PLACEMENT GAME WITH A THIN D D THEME YOUR WIFE WILL EVEN LOVE THIS ONE MY WIFE HATES DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS AND FANTASY AND SHE REALLY LIKES THIS ONE

IF YOU GET THE BASE GAME AND LIKE IT DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THE EXPANSION
WHEN I HAVE KIDS I'M GONNA BE JUST LIKE YOU

YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY CHECK THE ZOMBICIDE SERIES AND ESPECIALLY THE LAST EDITION BLACK PLAGUE EASY TO PLAY AND SO MUCH FUN IT WORKS GREAT WITH 2 OR PLAYERS

ALSO I'M SURPRISED NOBODY SUGGESTED PANDEMIC I NEVER REALLY LIKED IT BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE DO THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF DIFFERENT EDITIONS THEME WISE FOR THIS ONE THE COOLEST FOR ME BEING REIGN OF CTHULHU

THE UPCOMING MASMORRA RELEASED JAN I THINK WHICH IS A DUNGEON CRAWLER OCH ARCADIA QUEST ALREADY OUT SEQUEL COMING SOON WHICH IS A DUNGEON CAMPAIGN GAME MAYBE THE LATTER HAS RECEIVED TONS OF PRAISE AND IT'S PACKAGED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT ACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN WHILE STILL BEING PLENTY NERDY MASMORRA HAS THE SAME DESIGN SO IT SHARES THE SAME GRAPHICAL APPEAL AS WELL
BOSS MONSTER WOULD BE A GOOD ONE TO GET YOU CREATE DUNGEONS TO TRAP THE HERO CARDS ALL DONE WITH BIT STYLE ARTWORK
TALISMAN AND RUNEBOUND ARE GREAT FOR YOUR OLDER SON

IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE THE YOUNGER TRY TREASURE HUNTER CASTLE PANIC AND DRAGONHOOD HE'S A LITTLE YOUNG YET BUT COULD PLAY ON A TEAM WITH SOMEONE OLDER
IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH PLAYING I EAST YOU BEING THE DM AFTER ALL I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND CATACOMBS 3RD EDITION

IT'S A CLASSIC DUNGEON CRAWLER HOWEVER INSTEAD OF ROLLING DICE OR CONSULTING TABLES TO MOVE AND ATTACK YOU SIMPLY FLICK WOODEN DISKS ACROSS THE BOARD

FOR EXAMPLE WANNA DO A MELEE ATTACK FLICK YOUR CHARACTER AND EVERY MONSTER THAT THEY HIT TAKES A DAMAGE YOU'RE THE ELF AND WANT TO DO YOUR SPECIAL MOVE FIRST FLICK YOUR CHARACTER TO POSITION YOURSELF THEN PLACE A TINY ARROW DISK NEXT TO YOURSELF AND ATTACK WITH THAT
FOR YOUR YOUNGER ONE IN A FEW YEARS JAMAICA MIGHT BE GOOD AND WILL HOLD YOUR AND THE OLDER ONES ATTENTION

IT'S A BOAT RACING GAME OF PIRATES BOOTY AND BROADSIDES
AS RECOMMENDED EARLIER ON THIS THREAD MICE AND MYSTICS IS A GREAT FIT IMO I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH YOU'RE INTO WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES BUT LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS A REALLY FUN AND FANTASY THEMED GAME TO PLAY IF YOU CAN I'D RECOMMEND GETTING THE EXPANSION AS WELL SINCE IT ADDS A LOT OF MISSING FUNCTIONALITY TO THE GAME IT WILL BE TOO HEAVY FOR A YEAR OLD TO UNDERSTAND BUT I'M SURE YOU COULD HAVE SOME FUN WITH IT YOU ALSO GET TO SCREW PEOPLE OVER WITH INTRIGUES WHICH NEVER GETS OLD
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT AS YOU BUT YEARS YOUNGER SO MY ONLY CHILD IS 2 BUT THAT'S NOT STOPPED ME LOOKING I'M LOOKING AT MASSIVE DARKNESS SAME PEOPLE WHO DO ZOMBICIDE MORE RPG ELEMENTS AND A LITTLE MORE OF A DUNGEON CRAWL NOT OUT YET UNTIL NEXT YEAR KICKSTARTER IS OVER BUT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTACT CMON FOR A PLEDGE LOTS OF LOOT AND COOL LOOKING MINIATURES I'M ALSO GETTING DARK LIGHT MEMENTO MORI BUT THAT'S FOR ME AND FRIENDS MIGHT BE BE A BIT TOO COMPLICATED AND DISTURBING THEME WISE
YOU SHOULD ALSO CHECK OUT

THE CLASSIC STARTER GAMES ARE SETTLERS OF CATAN TICKET TO RIDE CARCASSONNE ALL ARE GREAT AND NERDY BUT NOT IN THE D D THEME

FOR D D TYPE GAMES TALISMAN LORDS OF WATER DEEP WIZ WAR ASCENSION
TAKE A LOOK AT PLAID HAT GAMES MICE AND MYSTICS IT'S A GREAT COOPERATIVE FANTASY DUNGEON CRAWLER WITH A GREAT NARRATIVE WHERE THE PLAYERS PLAY AGAINST THE BOARD
CATAN IS A GAME WE JUST GOT NOT TOO LONG AGO AND IT IS GREAT

E OKAY SO BASICALLY IT IS SIMILAR TO THE CIVILIZATION GAMES IN BOARD STRUCTURE IT HAS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HEXAGONS WITH DIFFERENT RESOURCES BRICK WOOD STONE AND HAY THAT YOU USE TO BUILD TOWNS AND CITIES AT THE END OF EACH TURN YOU MAY OFFER A TRADE TO EVERYONE EG I HAVE HAY IF ANYONE WILL GIVE ME BRICKS TO GET RESOURCES YOU NEED THE GAME IS OVER WHEN YOU GET A CERTAIN NUMBER OF VICTORY POINTS BTW HOW YOU GET RESOURCES IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A TOWN ON ANY ONE HEXAGON AND SOMEONE ROLLS THE NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEXAGON YOU GET THOSE RESOURCES

THERE ARE ALSO QUITE A FEW EXPANSIONS YOU CAN BUY THAT SHAKE UP THE GAME QUITE A BIT
ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE MY TEENAGER LOVES IT
I'M GOING TO GO AGAINST THE CONSENSUS AND SAY DON'T GET MICE AND MYSTICS IT'S VERY SIMPLISTIC WITH NOT MUCH ACTUAL GAME TO IT THE MINIATURES ARE CUTE BUT THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO MEANINGFUL DECISIONS AND YOUR YEAR OLD WILL GET BORED OF IT QUICKLY IF YOU JUST WANT TO ROLL DICE THERE ARE BETTER GAMES I ALSO FOUND THE STORY ONE OF THE MAJOR SELLING POINTS OF THE GAME TO BE PRETTY POORLY WRITTEN AND CLICHE

DESCENT IS A MUCH BETTER OPTION AND THE APP MAKES IT A PURE CO-OP IF YOU WANT A DUNGEON CRAWLER ANOTHER GOOD ONE IS SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE DUNGEON CRAWLER WITH AN OLD WEST MEETS MAGIC THEME A FEW PARTS OF THE GAME ARE A LITTLE WONKY UNBALANCED BUT THAT MATTERS LESS IN A FULLY CO-OP GAME AND IT GETS MY VOTE IN SPITE OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST RIDICULOUSLY FUN
HERE ARE MY LISTS ACCORDING TO BG

OVERRATED GAMES

UNDERRATED GAMES
MY LIST ACCORDING TO BG

OVERRATED

UNDERRATED

OVERRATED COUNTLESS

UNDERRATED ABYSS BROOM SERVICE COVERT IMHOTEP PANDEMIC THE CURE TOBAGO SURE THESE HAVE GOTTEN SOME HYPE BUT NOT NEARLY ENOUGH FOR HOW AWESOME THEY ARE
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T START PROCESSING AND SHIPPING UNTIL THIS WEEK
I ONLY HAVE IA FROM THAT LIST ONE THING TO NOTE ABOUT IT IS THAT IT ONLY ACCOMMODATES A MAXIMUM OF PLAYERS IT IS PLAYED AS IDEALLY OTHER THAN THAT IS BORROWS A LOT OF ITS GAMEPLAY FROM DESCENT

PAGE SOUTH WATCH THE MUSD VIDEOS ON IA AND DESCENT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY

EDIT ADDED POSTSCRIPT
SOME OTHERS ALL CO OP

SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE FULL CO-OP LOTS OF MINIS AND DICE ROLLING PERSISTENT CHARACTERS WITH LIGHT RPG SYSTEM BETWEEN MISSIONS CTHULU WESTERN THEME PLAYS UP TO

WARHAMMER QUEST SILVER TOWER VERY SCALED DOWN DUNGEON CRAWLER LOTS OF HERO CHOICES BUT ANG CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT EXCELLENT MINIS SOLID RULE SET AND SHORTISH PLAY TIME SET IN AGE OF SIGMA PLAYS

MANSIONS OF MADNESS NOT TECHNICALLY A DUNGEON CRAWLER BUT VERY SIMILAR APP DRIVEN RPG FEEL FULL CO-OP MANSION TOWN CRAWL CTHULU BASED AND IN MY TOP THIS YEAR PLAYS UP TO

THE UNVERACITY PRIVATEER PRESS PERSISTENT CHARACTERS SET IN THE WARMACHINE UNIVERSE BOARD IS A BIT MPH BUT SOLID RULE SET PLENTY OF MINIS AND EACH CHARACTER HAS A DIFFERENT FEEL PLAYS

MYTH BEAST OF A GAME WITH AN AWFUL RULE SET THAT SAID THE LATEST RULES WHICH ARE ON THE WEBSITE ARE PRETTY GOOD BUT DOES MEAN SELF PRINTING A LOT OF CARDS IF YOU CAN ONLY FIND THE OLD EDITION FREE FORM ADVENTURING SOME CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BUT EXCELLENT BOSS MECHANICS PLAYS UP TO

ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE MEDIEVAL DUNGEON CRAWL ALL ONE OFF SESSIONS BUT GOOD FUN NICE STEP UP FROM MOST GATEWAY STYLE GAMES EXCELLENT THEME PLAYS UP TO
I HAVE MICE AND MYSTICS IT'S A GREAT GAME A FUN NARRATIVE RPG BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT ONLY GOES UP TO PLAYERS

YOU COULD ALSO LOOK INTO ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE I THINK IT SUPPORTS UP TO PLAYERS NORMALLY BUT BG SAYS IT GOES UP TO BUT IS BEST WITH IT HAS AN APOCALYPTIC MEDIEVAL SETTING AND PLENTY OF ADDITIONAL CONTENT BOTH OFFICIAL AND HOMEBREW

THERE ARE ALSO A FEW GAMES COMING OUT THAT YOU COULD LOOK INTO GETTING THROUGH PLEDGING LATE PLEDGING ON KICKSTARTER OR OTHERWISE FOR EXAMPLE MASSIVE DARKNESS ENDURE THE STARS DEEP MADNESS SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE FORBIDDEN FORTRESS OR SIEGE OF THE CITADEL
HEY DESCENT IS GREAT ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE WANTING A DUNGEON CRAWLER CAMPAIGN IT IS MORE COMPLEX THAN MOST OF YOUR GAMES THOUGH MICE AND MYSTICS IS A MUCH SIMPLER GAME BUT WORKS ON SIMILAR MECHANICS VAST JUST CAME OUT AND IS A WILD GAME THAT SEEMS TO BE DOING WELL ON BBB IT DOES NOT HAVE CAMPAIGN MODE I HAVE ALSO PLAYED DUNGEON ROLL IT'S A MINUTE FILLER DUNGEON CRAWLER GAME THAT COMES IN A CHEST IT'S PRETTY NEAT AS A SIDE NOTE LOOKING AT THE TYPE OF GAMES YOU SEEM TO LIKE COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS A PRETTY AWESOME GAME
I REALLY TRIED TO LIKE DESCENT I PLAYED IT FOR ABOUT HOURS I COULD NEVER GET INTO IT AND MY FRIENDS COULDN'T REALLY EITHER IT JUST FEELS RESTRICTIVE AND ARTIFICIAL WITH NO STRONG THEME TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IT ALWAYS FELT LIKE THE HEROES WERE GETTING IN EACH WAY

CONAN BY CONTRAST IS A NEW FAVORITE OF MY GROUP WE'VE PLAYED ABOUT TIMES IN THE MONTH SINCE I GOT IT IT FEELS OPEN AND FREE PLAYERS CAN TAKE AS MANY ACTIONS AS THEY WANT ASSUMING THEY HAVE THE ENERGY AND IN ANY ORDER AND THERE'S NO GRID SO YOU AREN'T TRYING TO GET AROUND EACH OTHER IT'S JUST FUN AND YOU AREN'T CHECKING THE RULES ALL THE TIME LIKE WE DID WITH DESCENT

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CONAN OVER DESCENT OR IT'S CLONES LIKE IMPERIAL ASSAULT ESPECIALLY OVER THE LONG TERM SINCE ALL OF US ARE ALREADY EXCITED TO CREATE OUR OWN SCENARIOS AND CAMPAIGNS LIKE WE DID IN THE S WITH HEROQUEST
PROJECTS BOOTS

TAKE A QUICK GANDER AT THIS BEFORE DECIDING CORE GAME SHIPS OUT IN SUMMER OF

GAMEPLAY CAN BE SEEN BY A VARIETY OF PEOPLE ON YOUTUBE IF IT SEEMS TO DARK OR HARDCORE FOR YOUR GUYS PROBABLY TRY DESCENT
DESCENT IS GREAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CLASSIC DUNGEON CRAWLER NORMAL FANTASY TROPES LOTS OF MONSTERS CAMPAIGNS WITH CHARACTER LEVELLING ALL ROUND SOLID FUN GAME IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS THE SAME GAME BASICALLY BUT WITH A STAR WARS THEME IF THAT'S YOUR PREFERENCE BOTH GOOD GAMES BUT PROBABLY NOT WORTH OWNING BOTH



SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE IS A WEIRD WEST SETTING WHICH IS DIFFERENT CO-OP HAS A MECHANIC THAT RANDOMLY GENERATES THE DUNGEON AS YOU EXPLORE INTERESTING CHARACTER PROGRESSION WHICH MAKES YOU WANT TO KEEP PLAYING SOME WONKY MECHANICS BUT IS THE MOST FUN TYPE GAME I'VE PLAYED EVER HANDS DOWN



MICE AND MYSTICS BLAH ROLL TO MOVE ROLL TO ATTACK FEW MEANINGFUL DECISIONS YOU DON'T REALLY LEVEL YOUR CHARACTERS FROM GAME TO GAME CUTE MINIATURES ARE GOOD STORY IS NOT WELL WRITTEN BUT IS ADEQUATE I GUESS MY YEAR OLD HAS OUTGROWN THE GAME ONE OF ONLY TWO GAMES I REGRET BUYING


OH MY YOU ARE MISSING THE BEST THEN SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE
ASIDE FROM THIS AWESOME TITLE CONAN HAS SERIOUS ISSUES OF GAME BALANCE AND RULES MICE AND MYSTICS IS A SPLENDID GAME BUT SOMEHOW DESCENT YOU CAN PLAY IT SOLO WITH AN APP BUT IA IS WAY MUCH BETTER IA IS THE SECOND BEST AFTER SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE
YOU CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT DUNGEONS DRAGONS FANTASY ADVENTURE OOP BUT EASILY FOUND USED OR ON EBAY AT AFFORDABLE PRICES OR THE DUNGEONS DRAGONS BOARDGAME SERIES I WOULD SUGGEST TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL BOX STILL THE BEST OF THE FOUR PUBLISHED
BUT BEWARE ALL THESE TITLES WON'T WORK WITH PLAYERS EXCEPT THE AWESOME SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE THAT CAN WORK WITH UP TO PLAYERS AND CAN BE PLAYED SOLO AS WELL
GOOD EVENING GEEKS HERE'S MY NEW DICE HARD VIDEO IN WHICH I TAKE A LOOK AT LORDS OF VEGAS FROM MAYFAIR GAMES HAVE MANY OF YOU PLAYED THIS IF SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE GAME WITH A VEGAS THEME
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES TO ME IT'S MONOPOLY FOR THE MODERN AGE GOOD BIT OF CAPITALISM LUCK AND MEANNESS AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR
THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME I LOVE HOW TACTICAL IT IS YOU CAN TRY A STRATEGY BUT THINGS CAN CHANGE SO MUCH BETWEEN TURNS YOU HAVE TO FLY BY THE SEAT OF YOUR PANTS
ABSOLUTELY ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES I KEEP DISCOVERING WAYS TO BE MEAN MY MOST RECENT EVIL DEED SAW ME TRADE MY PIP DIE IN A LARGE CASINO TO SOMEONE WHO HAD A GREEN TILE I WANTED THERE WERE NONE LEFT SO I COULD BUILD IT ELSEWHERE TO MAKE THAT CASINO BIGGER SOON AS I DID THAT I TURNED AROUND AND REROLLED THAT DIE I SOLD THEM WITH MY OTHER DICE AND TOOK BACK CONTROL OF THAT CASINO

EXCEPT I DIDN'T THEIR SINGLE DIE CAME UP AND MY DICE CAME UP STILL I LOVED THE MOVE

LOVE THIS GAME
I HAD TO PULL OUT BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY WORRIED WITH THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAD SUCH TROUBLE GETTING THEIR STUFF FROM THE FIRST KICKSTARTER AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE STUCK FOR A LONG TIME WHILE MVP WAS KILLING IT I'M GLAD TO SEE IT FINALLY GAINING SOME TRACTION HOPE YOU GUYS GET THE DRAGON UNLOCKED AND THAT EXPANDED TOWN AT LOOKS COOL TOO GOOD LUCK
I HAVE IT SET TO WATCH BUT I REALLY DOUBT I'M GOING TO JUMP ON IT

WHILE I LIKED THE FIRST THE FEUDAL JAPANESE THEME ISNT MY THING AND THE FACT IT WOULD THEMATICALLY CLASH WITH THE OTHER CORE SETS MAKES IT A TURN OFFICIAL WHICH IS SAD BECAUSE I LIKE THE OTHER WORLD CONCEPT

ALSO ADM HAS REARED ITS HEAD AND UNLIKE SOB I KNOW I WILL NEVER SEE THAT CORE GAME OR EXPANSIONS FOR CHEAPER
I SEE LORDS OF WATERDEEP HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED YET PERSONALLY I HAVE FOUND MORE SUCCESS WITH IT THAN STONE AGE WITH GROUPS THAT HAVE SIMILAR TASTES TO YOURS
BLUE ORANGE RECENTLY STARTED A NEW FAMILY LINE OF GAMES AND NEW YORK FITS THIS BILL ALSO HABA DID THE SAME AND ARUBA IS THE SAME LEVEL FOR ME

NEW GAME MEDURIS SEEMS TO BE THIS WEIGHT ALSO BUT I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT

THERE ARE LOADS OF GREAT GAMES IN THIS WEIGHT THOUGH
I WOULD GO WITH CARCASSONNE FIVE TRIBES AND MR JACK POCKET ALSO IF YOU ARE A FAN OF TICKET TO RIDE WITH TWO PLAYERS AND HAVE NOT PICKED UP THE SWITZERLAND MAP PACK I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AS IT IS TIGHTER AND MORE COMPETITIVE FOR 2 PLAYERS
WONDERS CARCASSONNE AND STONE AGE ALL FIT YOUR CRITERIA VERY WELL ALSO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ESCAPE
FIVE TRIBES IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES TO PLAY AT 2 AND WE JUST GOT THE ARTISANS EXPANSION AND IT IS AMAZING THERE'S SO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT BUT YOU EVENTUALLY BUILD AN INTUITION ABOUT WHERE CERTAIN NUMBERS ON A TILE CAN REACH AND THE CHANGES YOU'RE MAKING TO THE BOARD AND HOW THAT EFFECTS YOUR OPPONENTS PLAY AND YOUR BIDDING NEXT ROUND THEN YOU START FIGURING OUT THE INTRICACIES OF BIDDING AND THE RELATIVE POWER OF ALL THE VARIOUS SCORING METRICS IT'S A REALLY FUN GAME WITH A TON OF LIFE TO IT AND I'D CALL IT THE BEST DAYS OF WONDER GAME SO FAR
FIVE TRIBES AND ROYALS COME TO MIND
QUADROPOLIS
WONDERS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BOARD GAMES BUT I FEEL THAT IT IS QUITE BAD WITH 2 PLAYERS LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS VERY GOOD AT 2 AND MORE PLAYERS I WOULD ALSO CONSIDER TAKING A LOOK AT SCYTHE OR MANSIONS OF MADNESS 2ND EDITION THE APP IS REALLY HELPFUL AND TURNS THE GAME INTO A COMPLETE CO-OP STRATEGY GAME



SECOND WITH TWO BUT SCALES UP WELL AND HUGELY EXPANDABLE IF YOU'RE SO INCLINED
CHECK OUT QUADROPOLIS IT'S A CITY BUILDING GAME THAT SCALES FROM 2 WE SKIPPED RIGHT OVER THE BASIC GAME AND PLAYED THE ADVANCED VARIANT
I HAD A TON OF FUN WITH LANTERNS THIS WEEKEND I'M NOT SURE HOW IT PLAYS WITH 2 BUT IT FITS YOUR SIMPLE TO LEARN MECHANICS WITH STRATEGY ALSO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE A TILE LAYING GAME AND LANTERNS FITS THAT NICHE
LORDS OF WATERDEEP AND CARCASSONNE ARE 2 GAMES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR YOU
ANYTHING ON MY GATEWAY SHELF
GREAT SUGGESTIONS I HAVE GONE WITH CARCASSONNE FOR NOW AS I PLAYED A BIT ONLINE AND I LIKE IT THE SETUP IS ALSO NON-EXISTENT WHICH IS ALWAYS A BONUS

LORD OF WATERDEEP AND FIVE TRIBES ARE ON MY TO GET NEXT LIST FOR SURE
NICE JOB REALLY WISHED MORE GAMES HANDLED THIS ASPECT OF THE GAMES BETTER
I'D LOVE TO SEE THIS AGAIN AFTER YOU HAVE ADDED SOME EXPANSIONS
GREAT IDEA LOVE THE ART
I'M LOOKING FOR SOME MORE TWO PLAYER GAMES FOR ME AND MY WIFE IS THIS A GOOD OPTION SHE LOVES PANDEMIC
I'D LOVE TO SEE THIS AGAIN AFTER YOU HAVE ADDED SOME EXPANSIONS
HERE YOU GO IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM



JUST TRIED IT WITH ABOUT GAMES WHICH WORKED OUT TO ABOUT COMPARISONS BUT IT WENT PRETTY FAST AND WAS FUN THE NUMBER OF COMPARISONS SHOULD SCALE LIKE N LOG N WHERE N IS THE NUMBER OF GAMES

LET ME GET YOU STARTED

WORST MUNCHKIN
THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY INTERESTING PROJECT

I'D GO ABOUT IT IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WAY HMM I MAY NOTE THIS DOWN AND HAVE A CRACK AND IF HAPPY WITH RESULTS FEEDBACK HERE
I ACTUALLY MADE THAT FOR ANDROID LAST WEEK AS A LITTLE TOY PROJECT IT IS RALLY ODD TO FIND THE EXACT USE CASE MENTIONED HERE IT CURRENTLY JUST SORTS LINES OF TEXT BASED ON YOUR CHOICES IF THE INTEREST IS THERE I CAN POLISH IT OFF AND PUBLISH IT
YOU NEED A COI OPTION FOR HOW MUCH YOU SPEND

FOR EXAMPLE MY FRIENDS AND I ONLY GO TO BOARD GAME CAFES BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE OUR D D NEETUP GROUPS ARE HELD
I DON'T INCLUDE EXPANSION CONTENTION MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF TIMELINE I WOULD COUNT AS JUST TIMELINE
MAYBE SINCE YOU HAVE LOTS OF SMALL QUICK GAMES YOU SHOULD CATEGORIZE YOUR GAME COLLECTION BY SQUARE FOOT OR REALLY GET OUT OF THE BOX AND DO IT BY WEIGHT HOW MANY GAMES DO YOU HAVE POUNDS
I THINK THE SIZE OF THE GAMES IN YOUR COLLECTION AND THE NUMBER OF GAMES IN YOUR COLLECTION ARE TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE METRICS WITH NO CORRELATION TO EACH OTHER YOU CAN USE ONE OR THE OTHER THOUGH I'VE YET TO SEE ANYONE MAKE A CLAIM AKIN TO MY COLLECTION IS CUBIC FEET BUT YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT BE MIXING THE TWO

WITH THAT SAID I THINK THAT IT IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO ONLY COUNT BASE GAMES AND NOT COUNT EXPANSIONS OR VARIANTS THIS CAN BE AN EASY LINE TO DRAW WHEN THE EXPANSION VARIANT REQUIRES THE BASE GAME TO PLAY BUT DOES BECOME A BIT SUBJECTIVE WHEN THEY'RE STAND ALONE YOU KIND OF JUST HAVE TO WING IT AT THAT POINT BUT IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING I DO WHEN COUNTING MY GAMES
WHEN PEOPLE ASK I JUST TELL THEM THE NUMBER OF BASE GAMES I HAVE THAT MEANS THAT SOME GAMES LIKE DIXIT AND DIXIT ODYSSEY GET COUNTED TWICE WHICH IS FINE BECAUSE WHEN I LOG A PLAY FOR ONE OR THE OTHER IT FEELS LIKE A DIFFERENT GAME ONE FOR PLAYERS AND THE OTHER FOR PLAYERS

I DON'T COUNT PURE EXPANSIONS THOUGH WHICH MAKES THE COUNT BALLOON UP TO WITH ALL MY AGE OF STEAM EXPANSIONS AND THE DOZENS OF FREEBIES I'VE GOTTEN FROM MY SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SPILLBOX AND PLATO MAGAZINES

IF YOU'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IT USE BG AND JUST FILTER OUT EXPANSIONS AND THAT'LL BE YOUR NUMBER YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE CHEATING OR WHATEVER KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HANGUP YOU HAVE JUST REPORT IT
HOW ABOUT USING AN APPROXIMATION BASED ON LSRP PNP WOULD USE PRINTING LABOR COSTS THAT WAY YOU CAN LUMP SMALL GAMES TOGETHER AND STILL FACTOR IN EXPANSIONS WHICH ALSO TEND TO BE SMALLER IN BOTH PHYSICAL SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND IN TERMS OF IMPACT ON THE WALLET
I LIST ALL MY GAMES AND EXPANSIONS ON BG I DON'T HOWEVER LIST PROMOS OR BREAK DOWN MY BIG BOX GAMES INTO MULTIPLE LISTINGS I KNOW SOMEONE THAT DOES THIS TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE THEIR COLLECTION BUT IN THE END IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IT'S HOW IT'S MOST USEFUL TO YOU IT'S YOUR WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF INFORMATION
I DON'T COUNT EXPANSIONS AS SEPARATE GAMES I DO COUNT LITTLE CARD GAMES LIKE LOVE LETTER SO YOUR RIGHT IT MAKES MY COLLECTION OF ALMOST EVERYTHING FOR SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE TAKE UP MORE ROOM THEN LIKE SMALLER GAMES BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW THAT MATTERS
NOTHING I REALLY WANTED I GUESS BLOOD RAGE AND MANSIONS OF MADNESS CAN BE GOOD PICKUPS FOR SOME PEOPLE
MILLION DEALS ON TOYS AND MAGIC CARDS 2 DECENT DEALS ON BOARD GAMES SIGH
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS AMAZON PRIME THE DEALS HERE AREN'T TOO DIFFERENT FROM AMAZON BLOOD RAGE AND MANSIONS OF MADNESS ARE A TAD BIT LOWER BUT I WOULD WAIT FOR REPRINT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS
CHECK OUT QUANTUM DICE PIPS ACT AS ATTACK MOVEMENT SPECIAL MOVE CONQUER THE PLANETS BY HAVING ALL YOUR PIPS EQUAL THE NUMBER PRINTED ON THAT PLANET ALL ON A MODULAR BOARD WITH HIGH STRATEGY
SANTORINITE SHOULD BE COMING SOON IS REALLY AWESOME
HANAFI DOWN RIGHT FANTASTIC PLAYER COOPERATIVE CARD GAME
I SPOTTED STAC ON R ABSTRACTGAMES TOO WHICH LOOKS FUN TOO
YOU MIGHT ENJOY SOME OF THE FOLLOWING

QUADROPOLIS

VÖLUSPÁ

LEGACY THE TESTAMENT OF THE DUKE DECARCHY

SUMMONER WARS

HIVE

ARUBA

GOLD WEST

SCOVILLE

HARBOUR

THE MANHATTAN PROJECT
PATCHWORK AS MENTIONED IS A FOR TWO PLAYERS COMING IN VERY CLOSE BEHIND IT IS JAIPUR BOTH OF THESE HAVE A DEGREE OF LUCK BUT ARE MAINLY STRATEGY GAMES IT'S POSSIBLE TO LOSE A GAME OF JAIPUR DUE TO BAD LUCK HOWEVER BUT IT'S A SPEEDY GAME SO YOU CAN PLAY BEST OF THREE OR FIVE TO MITIGATE THAT
I SEE THE MAJORITY OF GAMES YOU ENJOY ARE ON THE AMERICAN SIDE OF BOARD GAMES NO JUDGMENT MOST OF MY COLLECTION IS AMERITRASH BUT PERHAPS A SOLID BUT MOSTLY SIMPLE EURO LIKE THE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY IS UP YOUR ALLEY IT DEFINITELY PLAYS BEST WITH

OTHER POSSIBLE GAMES

GALAXY TRUCKER UNLIKE ANYTHING ON YOUR LIST IT'S HEAPS OF FUN AND YOU CAN MITIGATE A LOT OF THE LUCK BY LOOKING AT MISSION CARDS AND COMPETENT SHIP BUILDING IF YOU'RE NOT UP TO WATCHING SOMETHING YOU BUILT BE HUMOROUSLY DESTROYED BY THE HAZARDS OF SPACE THIS IS PROBABLY NOT YOUR GAME

GHOST STORIES A SOLID CO-OP GAME THAT'S DEFINITELY TOUGH AND WORTH REVISITING NUMEROUS TIMES AND THAT'S ON THE EASY SETTING THOUGH ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT YOU CAN UP THE DIFFICULTY AS YOU SEE FIT

PAPERBACK AKA DOMINION MEETS SCRABBLE IT PLAYS COMPETITIVELY AND CO-OPERATIVELY

PANDEMIC LEGACY SEASON YOU CAN GENERALLY FIND IT FOR UNDER AND IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH THE EXPERIENCE IN MY OPINION THE DOWNSIDE BEING THAT ONCE YOU'VE PLAYED IT TIMES REALISTICALLY YOU'VE COMPLETED THE STORY AND CAN NO LONGER PLAY IT

PATCHWORK A SOLID 2 PLAYER GAME

QUANTUM MY GIRLFRIEND AND I ENJOY THIS AS A 2 PLAYER GAME BUT I THINK IT GETS EVEN BETTER WITH PEOPLE

SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE AS RECOMMENDED BY OTHERS HERE

BUT DEFINITELY WATCH YOUTUBE VIDEOS OF ALL RECOMMENDED GAMES BEFORE PURCHASING IT I'M PARTIAL TO SHUT UP SIT DOWN AS REVIEWERS

HAPPY GAMING
SUMMONER WARS IS MY FAVORITE 2 PLAYER GAME YOU CAN START WITH THE MASTER SET WHICH GIVES YOU QUITE A FEW RACES

STORE

THAT'S HOW I STARTED IT AND REALLY GOT INTO IT

THERE IS LUCK WITH ROLLING DICE FOR ATTACKING BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO INCREASE YOUR ODDS BY ATTACKING WITH POWERFUL CHARACTERS OR USING SPECIAL EVENT CARDS TO MITIGATE LUCK I PLAY IT QUITE REGULARLY WITH A FRIEND AND IT'S STILL FUN EVERY TIME IT'S BEEN CALLED A MIX OF CHESS AND MAGIC THE GATHERING WITHOUT THE INSANE COMPLEXITY OF EITHER
YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH LE HAVRE
MAYBE END
YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT MEXICA ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND IT'S JUST GOTTEN A GORGEOUS REPRINT WITH HEAVY RESIN TEMPLES THIS LAST YEAR GREAT FOR UP TO AT TWO THERE ARE SOME DUMMY BUILDINGS PLACED RANDOMLY ON THE BOARD BUT NOT A DUMMY PLAYER PER SE I THINK IT WORKS QUITE WELL GAMES CAN GO FASTER THAN AN HOUR BUT THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR AP GIVEN YOUR POTENTIAL SIX ACTIONS PER TURN ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY GAME WHEN THE BOARD IS WIDE OPEN
I RECOMMEND PANDEMIC AND SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE
MR JACK PATCHWORK AND SAMURAI ARE ALL GREAT TWO PLAYER GAMES THAT ARE PLAYED IN MINUTES OR UNDER OR PRETTY CLOSE TO
THE BEAUTY OF WITS AND WAGERS IS THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO KNOW A LOT OF RANDOM TRIVIA TO DO WELL OR HAVE FUN SAY THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY POUNDS OF POTATOES DOES THE AVERAGE AMERICAN EAT PER YEAR BEING AMERICAN DOESN'T HELP YOU IN THIS INSTANCE UNLESS YOU SOMEHOW KNOW THIS USELESS FACT DOING WELL IS BASED ON HOW YOU BET THINKING WHO ELSE MIGHT KNOW THE ANSWER PUTTING DOWN A LOW NUMBER JUST SO NO ONE CAN GET THE TO ODDS ETC
THERE'S SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT ARE AND MANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE AMERICAN ABOUT NFL FOOTBALL BASKETBALL AND I THINK EVEN SOME BASEBALL SO WHILE I AGREE WITH THE OTHER COMMENTER THAT W W DOESN'T REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE PER SE IT'S NOT A LOT OF FUN WHEN YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA ABOUT WHAT'S BEING ASKED I THINK YOU CERTAINLY COULD PLAY BUT HAVE A QUESTION VETO OPTION IF YOUR PLAYERS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AMERICAN SPORTS
IT'S AN EPIC STORYTELLING MINIATURE BOARD GAME THAT IS NOT DUNGEON CRAWLER VERY HIGH ENTRY FEE AND COMPLICATED SYSTEM INCREDIBLE YET CONTROVERSIAL ARTWORK A BOARD GAME FOR GAMER IN MY OPINION
MY BROTHER IN-LAW FUNDED IT AT THE LEVEL I'M HAVING TROUBLE SEEING THE VALUE COMPARED TO D D MINIATURES IN MY OPINION ADD NOTHING TO THE GAME PLAY SO IT'S A WASTE ON THAT FRONT

I'M JUST NOT SEEING HOW THE REST OF THE GAME COULD SURPASS YEARS OF D D FINE TUNING EXPANSIONS RESOURCES AND COST EFFICIENCY
CHEERS FOR THE FOLKS ANSWERING I JUST SAW IT ON KICKSTARTER WITH IN DAYS BUT I'D SEEN NEWS OR INFORMATION ABOUT IT BEFORE HAND AND DIDN'T REALLY GET WHERE THE CRAZE WAS COMING FROM

AND THANKS TO THE FOLKS WHO JUST DOWNVOTE PEOPLE ASKING ACTUAL QUESTIONS SO MUCH HELP
WELL TO SOME PEOPLE ME INCLUDED IT IS THE BOARDGAME TO RULE THEM ALL ASSUMING YOU LIKE THE GAMEPLAY IF YOU OWN IT YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED OTHER GAMES SINCE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO KEEP PLAYING THAT

THE GAME IS ALMOST FLAWLESS ON SO MANY LEVELS

MINIATURE QUALITY DETAILS ARE UNMATCHED
THE ART LORE AND SETTING ARE REALLY GOOD YES THAT GOOD IF YOU ARE INTO REALLY DARK AND CREEPY STUFF
THE VARIOUS PHASES OF GAMEPLAY ARE VERY GOOD BLEND VERY WELL AND COMPLETE EACH OTHER VERY WELL

HENCE WHY PRICE IS THAT HIGH YOU PAY PREMIUM TO GET PREMIUM IF YOU HAVE A GOLD BAR BURNING A HOLE IN YOUR POCKET I SUGGEST GRABBING THE PLEDGE YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW FAR THAT CORE BOX SET CAN TAKE YOU

EXPANSIONS ARE LIKE GETTING A GREENHOUSE FOR YOUR MANSION YOU DON'T NEED THAT YOUR HOUSE IS ALREADY SO BIG YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ALL THE ROOMS BUT YOU JUST WANT SOME MORE

AS FOR DETAILS REGARDING GAMEPLAY I AM FAIRLY SURE SOMEONE ALREADY WROTE A POST WHILE I WAS WRITING THIS ONE
SO FOR ME AND MY WIFE KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER HAS BEEN THE MOST AMAZING GAME OF THE DECADE I AM COUNTING VIDEO GAMES IN THAT GROUP BTW

WE USED TO LOVE D D BUT GETTING A CONSISTENT GROUP TOGETHER WITH A STRONG GM CAN BE A NIGHTMARE AS A RESULT WE PLAYED DESCENT FOR A WHILE BUT WE FOUND THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH OF STORY OF D D A REALLY GOOD CAMPAIGN AND STILL NEEDED SOMEONE TO PLAY A GM

STILL OTHER GAMES REALLY LACKED WHAT WE WOULD CALL A FAIR CHALLENGE

KINGDOM DEATH IS THE ULTIMATE GAME YOU HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER WHAT YOU HUNT BUT YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW OR CAN PREDICT HOW THINGS ARE REALLY GOING TO GO THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES YOU PLAY YOU GET YOUR BUTT KICKED SEVERELY BUT EACH SESSION RESULTS IN MORE AND MORE LEARNINGS AND OVER TIME YOU GET MORE AND MORE SUCCESSFUL EVENTUALLY YOU REACH A WALL THEN YOU HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH THAT COMPLETELY CHANGES HOW YOU PLAY GOING FORWARD WHICH HELPS YOU TO PROGRESS EVEN FURTHER UNTIL THE NEXT WALL AND ON AND ON AND ON

NOW ADD INTO THAT MIX OVER A DOZEN EXPANSIONS THAT CAN BE MIXED AND MATCHED INTO THE MAIN GAME MULTIPLE OTHER CAMPAIGN SETTINGS LIKE PEOPLE OF THE STARS AND PEOPLE OF THE SUN THAT DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE ENTIRE FEEL OF THE SETTLEMENTS AND YOUR SURVIVORS AND YOU HAVE A BOARD GAME WITH AN INSANE AMOUNT OF REPLACEABILITY THAT NEVER FEELS OLD OR REALLY REPETITIVE

HOPE THIS HELPS IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ANY OF THE EXPANSIONS YOU CAN CHECK OUT A FEW OF OUR VIDEOS ALSO LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

WATCH V IUVZMG
TABLETOPIA OR TABLETOP SIMULATOR SOME SPACEBUCKS OUTLAY BUT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT TO PLAY GAMES
CHECK OUT THEY'VE GOT A BUNCH OF GAMES YOU CAN PLAY ALL IN BROWSER WORKS REALLY WELL WITH A HANGOUTS WINDOW SIDE-BY-SIDE
WHY NOT USE TABLETOP SIMULATOR TO PLAY IT'S BASICALLY A BOARD GAME SIMULATOR ALTHOUGH MUCH MORE WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON STEAM FOR AROUND DOLLARS IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN ANY ONLINE BOARD GAME SITE IMO IT IS REALLY EASY TO SET UP AND THERE'S LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF FREE GAMES READY TO PLAY INCLUDED
ANYTHING CO-OP IS COOL LIKE THE GOOD OL PANDEMIC AND FORBIDDEN ISLAND DESERT

NOT A BOARD GAME BUT CHECK OUT KEEP TALKING AND NOBODY EXPLODES AS WELL
KIND OF A TABLE TOP GAME THE GUYS I PLAY BOARDGAMES WITH ALSO REALLY LIKE KEEP TALKING AND NOBODY EXPLODES WE HAVE PLAYED BEFORE FROM SEPARATE HOUSES OVER SKYPE IT ADDS A NICE LITTLE THEMATIC ELEMENT WHEN WE ARE ALL SEPARATE IT'S ALSO NICE SINCE IT ONLY TAKES ONE PERSON TO PURCHASE THE GAME EVERYONE ELSE CAN BE ON THE PAPER SIDE OF THINGS
DOMINION ONLINE IS PRETTY COOL
CAPTAIN SONAR WOULD WORK PERFECTLY OVER SKYPE WOULDN'T PLAY ANY DIFFERENT AT ALL
ONE GAME THAT RODNEY FROM WATCH IT PLAYED USED TO MENTION HE LIKED TO PLAY ONLINE WAS EMINENT DOMAIN HE DOES HAVE DETAILS ON HIS CHANNEL ABOUT USING 2 COPIES OF THE GAME TO PLAY AND EVEN SOME EXAMPLES OF IT
I REALLY ENJOY WARHAMMER QUEST SILVER TOWER AS A SOLO GAME THE MINIATURES ARE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC AND THE GAMEPLAY IS VERY TACTICAL AND YET EASY TO GRASP
IF YOU'RE INTO ZOMBIES THERE'S ALWAYS ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE IT'S AN APOCALYPTIC FANTASY MEDIEVAL SETTING WITH A BOAT LOAD OF MINIATURES YOU CAN PLAY IT SOLO OR WITH OTHERS COOPERATIVELY

MICE AND MYSTICS IS ALSO FANTASY MEDIEVAL AND HAS PLENTY OF COOL MINIATURES IT'S A NARRATIVE RPG AND AGAIN CAN BE PLAYED SOLO OR CO-OP THE CHARACTERS ARE MICE SO THAT MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BUT IT'S A REALLY FUN GAME

EDIT I SHOULD ADD THAT SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE FORBIDDEN FORTRESS IS UP ON KICKSTARTER RIGHT NOW IT HAS A FANTASY MEDIEVAL JAPANESE THEME AND HAS SOME REALLY KILLER MINIS IT'S EXPENSIVE THOUGH AND NOT SLATED TO SHIP UNTIL
THE DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS BOARD GAMES LIKE WRATH OF ASHARDALON CAN BE PLAYED SOLO THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS LIKE ELEMENTAL EVIL DRIZZLE AND RAVENLOFT BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THE VARIOUS ONES RANK AGAINST EACH OTHER
YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO LOOK IN TO SWORD SORCERY FROM ARES GAMES AND MASSIVE DARKNESS

HOWEVER FROM WHAT I'VE READ YOU CAN EASILY PLAY GLOOMHAVEN SOLO AND WITH FRIENDS ALL THE QUESTS ARE ENDLESSLY REPEATABLE SO IF YOU DO A QUEST ON YOUR OWN IT'S NOT HARD TO DO IT WITH A GROUP ALSO HOWEVER SOME OF THEM HAVE SPECIAL REWARDS OR CAUSE AN EITHER OR CHOICE BE MADE WHICH IS PART OF THE LEGACY COMPONENT SO CHOICES CAN'T BE REMADE AND THE CHEST THAT ITEM WAS IN IS NOW EMPTY
YOU CAN RUN SEPARATE PARTIES SIMULTANEOUSLY IN GLOOMHAVEN AND BOTH AFFECT THE WORLD
I REALLY LIKE DESCENT WITH THE APPARENTLY I'VE PLAYED SOME OF THE FIRST CAMPAIGN THEN STARTED TO MOVE SO I HAVEN'T GOTTEN VERY FAR
I REALLY RECOMMEND GALAXY DEFENDERS AND MAYBE SWORD AND SORCERY DEFINITELY MY FAVOURITE GAMES TO SOLO ALSO PLAY GREAT WITH OTHERS
HAVE TAKE A LOOK AT 7TH CONTINENT
THE WALKING DEAD ALL OUT WAR IS MORE OF A BOARD GAME SKIRMISH GAME HYBRID BUT IT HAS A VERY SATISFYING SOLO MODE IT'S VERY TACTICAL AND THEMATIC ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE AS MENTIONED ABOVE IS ALSO GOOD
DOUBLING ON THE ZOMBIE THEME IS ACCIDENTAL
DESCENT I'VE PLAYED BOTH CAMPAIGNS AND OF A DELVE I LOVED IT MY WIFE AND I ALSO PAINT THE MINIS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE APP FOR SOLO PLAY AND THE MINIS FOR PAINTING

SHADOWS I'VE PLAYED A COUPLE OF SCENARIOS BUT THE ROLL TO MOVE MECHANIC KINDA KILLS IT FOR ME THE MINIS ARE SUB PAR AND MUST BE ASSEMBLED FROM SPRUES

GLOOMHAVEN I HAVE NOT PLAYED IT BUT AFTER PLAYING PANDEMIC LEGACY I FEEL LIKE A LEGACY GAME MIGHT BEST BE SHARED WITH ANOTHER
PROJECTS BOOTS

THIS GAME CAN BE PLAYED SOLO IGNORE THE MISLEADING DELIVERY TIME THAT IS FOR EVERYTHING CORE GAME DELIVERS IN SUMMER

ALSO COMES WITH GOBS OF MINIATURES THAT YOU CAN BUILD YOURSELF TO YOUR OWN LIKING SEE THE ARMOR KITS DECRYPTION

THERE ARE DESCRIPTIONS AND PLAY VIEWS OF THE GAME ON YOUTUBE
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT ADVANCED SONG OF BLADES AND HEROES

FROM THE WEBSITE
ADVANCED SONG OF BLADES AND HEROES IS THE UPDATED INCARNATION OF THE SONG OF BLADES MINIATURES SYSTEM

PLAY FANTASY SKIRMISHES IN ANY SCALE WITH ANY MODELS YOU ALREADY OWN

WITH AN EXPANDED MAGIC SYSTEM AN EXCITING TURN SEQUENCE AN OPTIONAL SETTING WEAPON RULES AN POINT SYSTEM AND COMBAT MECHANICS THAT KEEP PLAYERS INVOLVED AT ALL TIMES THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE EPIC STORIES YOU CAN CREATE


ARBORETUM A PRETTY NEAT STRATEGY CARD GAME IF YOU DRAW IT RECOMMENDS BOTH OR ALL PLAYERS GO OUT AND PLANT A SMALL TREE THE ONE THAT HAS GROWN MOST AFTER A YEAR IS THE WINNER IT AMUSED THE LIFE OUT OF ME AND AS SUCH I LOVE IT
BLOOD BOWL TEAM MANAGER HAS MY FAVORITE

AFTER THE FINAL TALLY THE MANAGER WITH THE MOST FANS WINS THE GAME

IF THERE IS A TIE FOR MOST FANS THE TIED MANAGER WHO ACCUMULATED THE MOST IMPROVEMENTS WINS THE GAME

IF THERE IS STILL A TIE THE TEAM MANAGER S UNION SUSPECTS FOUL PLAY AND CONDUCTS AN INVESTIGATION THE TEAM MANAGERS UNION AMU SUSPENDS EACH SUSPECTED TIED MANAGER INDEFINITELY AND THEY LOSE ALL THEIR FANS THE AMU PRESENTS THE MANAGER OF THE YEAR AWARD TO THE REMAINING MANAGER WHO GAINED THE MOST FANS AND THAT MANAGER WINS THE GAME INSTEAD

IF ALL MANAGERS ARE STILL TIED AFTER CHECKING FOR THE MOST WELL-DEVELOPED TEAM THEN THE AMU LOSES ALL CREDIBILITY THE FANS REVOLT AND NOBODY WINS THE GAME
I DO LOVE TIE BREAKER

ALSO A FAVOURITE IS THIS FINAL TIE BREAKER FROM MARKET

IF STILL TIED THE FIRST PLAYER TO GRAB THE START PLAYER MARKER AND RUN FROM THE ROOM SHOUTING YOU FOOLS MUAHAHAHA WINS
I MOSTLY PREFER IF A RULE BOOK SIMPLY JUST STATES THAT PLAYERS SHARE THE TIE UNLESS THERE IS SOME SORT OF SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENT BETWEEN EACH PLAYERS ENDING CONDITIONS WHICH JUSTIFIES A TIE BREAK

ALTHOUGH I LIKE HOW AGRICOLA DOES IT THE RULE BOOK SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT IF YOU EXPERIENCE A TIE JUST PLAY THE GAME AGAIN TO BREAK THE TIE
I LIKE ANY TIE BREAKER THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT SCORING RESOURCE AS IT FEELS SIGNIFICANT BUT AFTER THE FIRST TIE BREAKER I'D RATHER HAVE A COMEDY OR A SHARED VICTORY BEYOND ONE TIE BREAKER IT STARTS TO FEEL KINDA PETTY LIKE BASING A WIN ON SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T MATTER
I THINK OUR LEAST FAVORITE WAS TIE BREAKER THE FIRST GAME WE HAD PLAYED OF IT HAD BEEN KIND OF BLAND DUE TO THE POINT TILES MAKING IT VERY OBVIOUS WHICH TILES TO TAKE NOT TO TAKE WE TIED ON POINTS AND READ THROUGH THE WHOLE RULES THAT STATED AFTER THE OTHER TIE BREAKERS THAT WE'D HAVE TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME OF SUBURBIA TO BREAK THE TIE WE NOW OFTEN REFERENCE PLAY A GAME OF SUBURBIA WHENEVER ANYONE ASKS ABOUT WHAT A TIE BREAKING RULES ARE
YEAH WE KNEW IT WASN'T SERIOUS AND HAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY ACTUALLY JUST CALL IT A FULL TIE THERE BUT THE FIRST GAME OF IT WE PLAYED HAD POINT TILES OUT THAT MADE SOME OF THE HEXES UNWANTED AND NEITHER OF US WOULD HAVE WANTED TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME RIGHT AFTER SO WHILE THE ACTUAL WORST TIED RULES PROBABLY FALL TO SOMETHING WITH UNCLEAR RESOLUTIONS NO THOUGHT ABOUT TIES AT ALL OR SOMETHING ARBITRARY THAT ALSO ISN'T FUN LIKE EARLIEST BIRTHDAY OR OLDEST PLAYER SUBURBIA IS HE ONE THAT STANDS OUT BECAUSE WE REALIZED THAT WE DEFINITELY WEREN'T IN THE MOOD FOR ANOTHER GAME OF IT AFTER THE ONE WE JUST PLAYED
I SAY JUST LET THEM TIE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT FUN MORE THAN ANYTHING
USE PADDING ON ALL SIDES OF THE PACKAGE EVEN UNDERNEATH YOUR ITEM IMAGINE SOMEONE PLAYING SOCCER WITH YOUR PARCEL FOR A WHILE IT SHOULD WITHSTAND THAT
WRAPPING THEM AS PAIRS IN BUBBLE WRAP SHOULD DO IT
THEY MAKE ROLLS OF THIN FOAM FOR PACKING DISHES THAT IS REALLY CHEAP AMAZON LINK I WOULD USE THAT TO INDIVIDUALLY WRAP THE FIGURES SECURE THE FOAM WITH SOME TAPE THEN PACK THEM WITH A LAYER OF PAPER BUBBLE WRAP ON TOP AND ON BOTTOM OF THE FIGS TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T SHAKE AROUND IN TRANSIT
IT'S POSSIBLE TO PURCHASE THE GAME DIRECTLY FROM A SOUTH AMERICAN RETAILER IF YOU PAY VIA PALPAL AND SOMETIMES EVEN CREDIT CARDS THEY'LL CONVERT THE CURRENCY FOR YOU AUTOMATICALLY
FAIRY TALE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD CARD DRAFTING GAME
IN TERMS OF PURE DRAFTING WONDERS IS THE GAME IT'S SIMILAR TO SUSHI GO WHICH YOU SAID YOU HAVE IN THAT THE BASIC GAMEPLAY IS THAT AS YOU DRAFT CARDS GET PLAYED AND YOU TOTAL POINTS AT THE END OF THE ROUND IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN SUSHI GO THERE ARE MORE VARIETIES OF CARDS AND MORE CHOICES ABOUT WHAT KIND OF STRATEGY TO PURSUE BUT THE BASIC GAMEPLAY IS SIMILAR

NEVERMORE HAS A DIFFERENT MECHANIC START WITH FIVE CARDS PASS AND GET FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR CARDS THEN 2 THEN YOU'LL END UP WITH A HAND OF FIVE CARDS THERE ARE FIVE CARD TYPES AND WHOEVER HAS THE MOST OF A GIVEN TYPE GETS TO TAKE AN ACTION FOR EXAMPLE WHOEVER HAS THE MOST SWORDS GETS TO DAMAGE ANOTHER PLAYER AND WHOEVER HAS THE MOST HEARTS GETS TO HEAL

OTHER GAMES USE DRAFTING AS ONE COMPONENT OF THE GAME ONE THAT COMES TO MIND IS SEASONS WHICH STARTS WITH A CARD DRAFT PLAYERS DRAFT THE SPELLS THEY WILL USE DURING THE GAME AND THROUGHOUT THE GAME PLAYERS DRAFT DICE THAT HAVE BEEN ROLLED THOUGH THE GAME HAS OTHER MECHANICS
I'LL EXPAND YOUR HORIZONS WITH TWO GAMES THAT USE DRAFTING MECHANICS BUT FOR WHICH THE DRAFT IS NOT THE ONLY PART OF THE GAME

STEAMPUNK RALLY EACH PLAYER IS AN INVENTOR AND EACH TURN STARTS WITH A DRAFT OF MACHINE PART CARDS WHICH MAY BE INSTALLED INTO YOUR CONTRAPTION OR DISCARDED TO GAIN POWER DICE TO FUEL THEIR CONTRAPTION ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE IN A RACE PHASE OF THE TURN

BETWEEN TWO CITIES PLAYERS DRAFT TILES RATHER THAN CARDS AND USE THEM TO BUILD TWO CITIES WITH THE PLAYERS TO THEIR LEFT AND RIGHT AT THE END OF THE GAME EACH PLAYER'S CITY COUNTS AS THEIR FINAL SCORE SO PLAYERS MUST BALANCE AND STRATEGIZE ON BOTH SIDES

BOTH ARE EASY TO LEARN AND PLAY WELL WITH LARGER GROUPS
AMONG THE STARS IS GOOD I LIKE IT TOM ASEL ONCE SAID IT REPLACED WONDERS FOR HIM IN ONE OF THEIR TOP VIDEOS SO I GUESS THEY'RE SIMILAR HAVEN'T PLAYED IT

IF YOU WANT TO PLAY 2 PLAYERS ONLY YOU COULD LOOK AT THE TIDES OF TIME TIDES OF MADNESS GAMES

I HAVE NEVERMORE AND THE EXPANSION BUT HAVEN'T GOT IT TO THE TABLE YET IT SEEMS REALLY GOOD THOUGH HENCE WHY I BOUGHT IT
YOU SHOULD PUT IN MORE DETAILS WHICH ONES DO YOU ALREADY OWN I'M ASSUMING NONE WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN THE GAME PLAYER COUNT DURATION COMPLEXITY ETC WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE MORE WELL KNOW DRAFTING GAMES WONDERS SUSHI GO ETC
WONDERS HAS AT LEAST ONE EXPANSION THAT SEEMS PRETTY GOOD NEVER MORE IS ANOTHER THAT IS DRAFTING IT HAS SOME INTERESTING MECHANICS
DO YOU WANT A GAME THAT IS DRAFTING PLAY WITH YOUR DECK OR DO YOU WANT DRAFTING WHERE THAT IS THE GAME

SEASONS IS MY RECOMMENDATION FOR A EXCELLENT DRAFTING GAME YOU WILL DRAFT A DECK AND THEN PLAY WITH IT WHILE KNOWING A BIT ABOUT THE OTHER PLAYERS DECKS IT CAN PLAY WELL EVEN AT 2 PLAYERS

AMONG THE STARS IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FOR PURE DRAFTING HOWEVER IT REALLY IS BEST PLAYED WITH I ALSO THINK WONDERS IS BEST WITH LOWER PLAYER COUNTS BUT IF I'M IN THE PLAYER RANGE COUNT I'D ALWAYS RECOMMEND AMONG THE STARS OVER IT THE EXPANSIONS FOR AMONG THE STARS ADD A LOT TO THE GAME HOWEVER THEY GREATLY INCREASE SETUP TIME SINCE YOU DON'T JUST GRAB THE DECKS SHUFFLE AND GO

WONDERS IS MY RECOMMENDATION TO SUPPORT HIGHER PLAYER COUNTS IT'S GOOD TO HAVE IN ANY COLLECTION FOR WHEN YOU NEED A LIGHT GAME THAT SUPPORTS PLAYERS W CITIES EXPANSION

SUSHI GO IF YOU WANT SOMETHING SUPER LIGHT AND SIMPLE IT'S TOO BASIC FOR MY PERSONAL TASTE BUT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IT
I LIKE AMONG THE STARS A LOT TERRAFORMING MARS AND BLOOD RAGE ALSO HAVE GREAT DRAFTING MECHANISMS IMO
START WITH DOMINION FROM THERE YOU WILL KNOW IF CARD DRAFTING IS SOMETHING YOU TRULY LIKE
I HAVE THE BASE GAME FACTIONS AND OUTER BELT I NEVER PLAY THEM AND WOULD SELL THE LOT FOR PLUS SHIPPING I'M IN THE US
PRICES ALIENFRONTIER

IT'S A GOOD GAME BUT NOT FOR ALTHOUGH FOR DICE PLACEMENT I REALLY RECOMMEND LOOKING INTO VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO MY GROUP TRADED AWAY ALIEN FRONTIERS AFTER PLAYING COMP
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD IPAD APPARENTLY I KNOW THIS SOUNDS CRAZY BUT I HAVE USED IT IN PERSON TO PLAY ALIEN FRONTIERS SINCE THERE IS NO HIDDEN INFORMATION IN THE GAME IT TAKES UP VERY LITTLE ROOM AND GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITHOUT A PHYSICAL COPY ASSUMING YOU HAVE A DEVICE THAT SUPPORTS IT
IT'S SELLING FOR ON AMAZON

DP REF S IE DTF QID SR KEYWORDS ALIEN FRONTIER
THE BIG BOX KS IS FINALLY SHIPPING SOON I ASSUME THERE WILL PROBABLY BE SOME IN STORES IT WAS BUT IT INCLUDES ALL THE EXPANSIONS YOU MIGHT WANT TO WAIT FOR THAT
JUST GO BY LAW IF IT'S A GOOD ENOUGH GAME IT WILL COME BACK INTO PRINTING YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT AWHILE BUT IT WILL PROBABLY BE BACK SOON I THINK THE LAST RUN WAS A YEAR AGO OR MORE SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF WE SAW IT AGAIN SOON

ALSO IF YOU MUST HAVE IT NOW CHECK MORE THAN AMAZON BG MARKET MIGHT BE A BETTER BET OR EBAY
THIS LOOKS LIKE WHAT YOU WANT
THIS MAY HELP
R BOARDGAMEEXCHANGE
THIS SUB HAS A MONTHLY B S T THREAD THAT IS POSTED AROUND THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH ALWAYS HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED POSTS AND MANY MANY MORE VIEWS I'D RECOMMEND AND HAVE HAD GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH POSTING GAMES UP THERE
BG HAS REGIONAL FORUMS IF YOU LIVE IN A LARGE ENOUGH AREA YOU MIGHT FIND SOME LUCK THERE OTHERWISE THERE IS A TOOL TO FIND TRADE PARTNERS WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY FIND TRADES FOR ITEMS YOU HAVE MARKED FOR TRADE AND LOOKING FOR ITEMS YOU HAVE MARKED WANT IN TRADE YOU CAN FILTER THOSE RESULTS BY LOCATION BIT ONLY BY STATE I'M NOT SURE HOW WELL THE FILTER WORKS IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE US
I'VE USED CRAIGSLIST IN THE PAST
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT IT MAY BE ONE WAY TO MITIGATE QUARTERBACKING FULL INFO GIVES A POTENTIAL QUARTERBACK ALL THE INFO THEY NEED TO DOMINATE THE GAME IF THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM WITH YOUR GROUP THEN I'D DROP IT

ALSO IT MAY HELP TO SPEED THE GAME ALONG IF YOU TALK ABOUT ALL INFORMATION ON THE CARDS INCLUDING THE ORDER OF PLAY AND WHO YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE TOKENS TO ETC THEN IT COULD REALLY SLOW DOWN THE GAME SO AGAIN NOT AN ISSUE IF YOUR GROUP ISN'T COLLECTIVELY PRONE TO AP

ON THE OTHER HAND YOU ARE GETTING ATTACKED BY FRIGGING GENESTEALERS IN FRONT AND BEHIND YOU SO ARE YOUR SQUAD MATES NO TIME FOR CHATTER ON FANCY COORDINATED MOVES ATTACK SUPPORT ACTIVATE THE CONTROL PANEL OH NO WHAT HAVE I DONE AAARGGH
IT ADDS A LAYER OF STRATEGY I SUPPOSE BUT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT EITHER I THINK IT'S KIND OF A SILLY RULE PERSONALLY

LOAR CG HAS A SIMILAR RULE CONCERNING TABLE TALK WHERE PLAYERS CANNOT MENTION WHAT CARDS ARE IN THEIR HAND BY NAME BUT THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY STOP A GROUP FROM COMING UP WITH EUPHEMISMS FOR SAID CARDS OR WHAT OR COMMUNICATING IT IN A WAY
IT'S TO PREVENT ONE GUY FROM PUZZLING OUT THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY AND FORCING THE OTHER PLAYER S TO GO WITH IT IN PRACTICE THOUGH IF YOU TRUST YOUR GROUP TO BE FAIR TO EACH OTHER AND TRULY WORK TOGETHER YOU CAN JUST IGNORE THIS RULE
THEMATICALLY IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU ARE IN DIFFERENT ROOM
I JUST BEAT THIS THREE PLAYER LAST NIGHT I IMAGINE IT WOULD BE TOUGHER WITH

IF I GET 2 OF BELLATRIX BARTY OR DEMEANOR IN FIRST SET OF VILLAINS I JUST SHUFFLE ESPECIALLY ON A PLAYER I KNOW I AM GOING TO LOSE SO I DON'T BOTHER WASTING THE TIME

PEOPLE LIKE TRANSFIGURATION TO PULL OUT A CARD WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT I THINK YOUR POWERS IS A GOOD SET

AS FAR AS CLEARING THE HOGWARTS SET DILUTING EARLY ON ISN'T HORRIBLE ALMOST EVERY CARD IS AT LEAST A LITTLE USEFUL THERE IS AN OFFICIAL FROM THE CREATOR OPTIONAL RULE WHERE ONCE PER GAME NOT PER PLAYER A PERSON WILL BUY NOTHING AND PLACE ALL CARDS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DECK

THE KEY TO THE GAME IS MANAGING THE 1ST LOCATION IF YOU CAN KEEP SKULLS OFF YOU ARE GOLDEN THE SECOND FOR YEAR IS MANAGING HORCRUXES HOPEFULLY YOU GET HOGWARTS A HISTORY SO YOU CAN CHOOSE DICE CHOOSING WHEN TO GO AFTER THEM AND WHEN TO STAY ON A HORCRUX IS KEY LAST IS I JUST SHUFFLE IF THE BILLIAN DECK IS STUPID
I DON'T HAVE VERY MANY I LIKE FLICK EM UP AND CLICK CLACK LUMBERJACK I WOULD LIKE TO GET CATACOMBS AND ICE COOL THOUGH
JUNK ART

RHINO HERO
I PLAY A LOT OF DEXTERITY GAMES BUT CROKINOLE IS MY FAVORITE
CROKINOLE IS EXPENSIVE BUT IT'S UNQUESTIONABLY THE BEST
MICRO MUTANTS PIRATE'S BLAST ANIMAL UPON ANIMAL CONNECT LAUNCHERS
GARBAGE DAY IS MY FAVORITE YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID CLEANING YOUR ROOM OR TAKING OUT THE TRASH SO YOU'LL BE BALANCING CARDS ON A PLASTIC TRASHMAN OR FORCING YOUR FRIENDS TO DO THE SAME IT'S SO MUCH FUN
STICK STACK IS REALLY FUN SIMPLE TO LEARN BUT THE SLIGHT RANDOMNESS MAKES FOR SOME DECISION MAKING THIS HAS EASILY BEEN A POPULAR PARTY DEXTERITY GAME WHENEVER I BRING IT OUT

I GOT IT AT TARGET
PITCH CAR ASCENDING EMPIRES ALA CARTE CATACOMBS DUNGEON FIGHTER MORD IM ALOSA
IT'S NOT CHEAP BUT I DO LOVE PITCHCAR
TUMBLIN DICE IS A FUN TIERED DICE ROLLING GAME THE GAMES GO SO QUICK THAT YOU CAN PLAY MULTI GAMES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
PIRATENBILLARD AND ICE COOL MAKE IT TO THE TABLE A LOT
BULLET BALL
I AM PERSONALLY A BIG FAN OF CAT TOWER
THE ONLY ONE I OWN IS CATACOMBS AND I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD MAYBE A BIT LONG BUT FUN
VILLA PALET
I AM IN A VERY SIMILAR POSITION TO YOU HERE'S WHAT I ULTIMATELY DECIDED FOR MYSELF

KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER HAS ALREADY BEEN RELEASED AND IS ABSOLUTELY BELOVED BY THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE PLAYED IT I WAS A LITTLE UNSURE ABOUT THE HYPE SINCE I BELIEVE WHEN PEOPLE MAKE THAT SIGNIFICANT OF A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT THEY ARE MORE PRONE TO LIKING THE GAME HOWEVER I HAVE SINCE HAD FRIENDS PLAY IT THAT DIDN'T PURCHASE IT THEMSELVES AND THEY LOVED THE EXPERIENCE

DARK SOULS ON THE OTHER HAND HASN'T RELEASED A RULEBOOK AND MANY DETAILS ARE STILL UNCLEAR ADD TO THAT THAT THEY HAVE DONE SOME FUNNY THINGS WITH SHIPPING AND IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT WE SHOULD BE SKEPTICAL OF THE KICKSTARTER

I MADE THE DECISION TO GO FOR ADM BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED FOR DARK SOULS ALL OF THE BOSSES WILL BE RELEASED AT RETAIL SO I WILL PLAY THE FULLY RELEASED GAME AND IF IT TURNS OUT THE WAY I HOPE INVEST IN THE MEGA BOSSES THAT WAS MY LOGIC AND I HOPE IT IS HELPFUL TO YOU
NO ONE KNOWS BECAUSE DARK SOULS ISN'T OUT
DID THE MATH DS BOSSES IS PRETTY MUCH THE PRICE OF ADM CORE SET CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY APPLY

ANYHOW AS SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T BITE ON DS AND BACKED ADM INSTEAD BASED ON YOUR DESCRIPTION IT SOUNDS LIKE DS WOULD BE BETTER YOU'RE ALREADY COMMITTED YOU'RE PROBABLY ALREADY AWARE OF THE CURRENT ISSUES AND THE DS BOSSES MINIS ARE THINGS YOU DEFINITELY WON'T REGRET ACQUIRING ARE YOU FINE PAYING JUST FOR THE MINIS IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE

ON THE OTHER HAND ADM DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING YOU'RE REALLY INVESTED IN YET NOT TO THE DEGREE THAT YOU ARE IN DS SO LET ME BREAK DOWN YOUR OPTIONS

GET DS BOSSES
2 GET ADM
GET BOTH EVENTUALLY

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU'RE LIMITED TO CHOICES ONE AND TWO THEN DS WILL WIN OUT AS FOR CHOICE THERE'S SEVERAL WAYS YOU CAN APPROACH THAT

GET YOUR FRIENDS TO BUY THE BOSSES YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO TURN OVER OWNERSHIP OF THE MINIS NOT SURE IF THAT'LL BE FINE WITH YOU

2 DECIDE NOW THAT YOU'LL WANT TO GET BOTH EVENTUALLY PLONK DOWN MONEY FOR ONE OF THEM PROBABLY DS AND ENABLE YOURSELF TO GET THE OTHERS AT SOME LATER POINT WHEN'S THE DEADLINE FOR COMMITTING TO DS BOSSES AT THE KS PRICE AS FOR ADM PLEDGE A DOLLAR GET THE UPDATES AND WAIT TO SEE HOW LONG YOU CAN HOLD OFF BEFORE COMMITTING IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE BEFORE THE DEADLINE MAYBE YOU CAN PICK IT UP AT RETAIL LATER ON PROBABLY I'M GUESSING DS MINIS WOULD HAVE SIMILAR PRICE INCREASES
HERE'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT

ADM IS OUT AND HAS MASSIVELY POSITIVE REVIEWS DS IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED AND WILL HOPEFULLY BE A GOOD GAME BECAUSE I BACKED IT TOO BUT WHO KNOWS

2 ADM HAS A MASSIVE DISCOUNT OVER RETAIL NEARLY HALF OFF WHEREAS TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE THE DS IS PRICED SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'LL GET AT RETAIL IF YOU WAIT FOR SALES AND SUCH SO WHY NOT WAIT AND SEE IF THEIR ACTUALLY WORTH IT

I TRUST BOOTS WITH MY MONEY HE HAS SHOWN THAT IF HE CAN'T DELIVER HE'LL GIVE YOU A REFUND IF THINGS AREN'T WORKING OUT HE'S SHOWN HE'LL THROW HIS OWN MONEY IN TO MAKE IT RIGHT IF DS FALLS APART WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN A STEAMING PILE OF CRAP THAT I HAVE TO TRY AND PAWN OFF I DON'T THINK THIS WILL HAPPEN OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T HAVE BACKED DS BUT IT COULD

SORRY BUT KINDA USELESS THREAD
MUNCHKIN IS WAY TOO LONG FOR ITS OWN GOOD
BOARDGAMES ARE ENJOYABLE
I LIKE THEM
DELETED
I USE APPS TO LEARN THE GAME THEN PLAY IT IRL
DEFINITELY HELPS THEY GET PEOPLE INTO THE HOBBY CAN BE USED AS A TEACHING TOOL AND PROVIDE A QUICK FIX FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT PLAY AT THAT EXACT TIME
HELPS ANYONE WHO'S PLAYED ACTUAL BOARD GAMES VS BG APPS KNOWS THAT THE EXPERIENCE IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

WHAT APPS CAN DO IS BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO THE HOBBY THEY PRESENT GREATER ACCESSIBILITY AND AFFORDABILITY TO THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE HOBBY AND AS MANY ADVERTISER THEIR BOARD GAME ITSELF IN THE APP IT'S POSSIBLE TO BRING MORE PEOPLE INTO PURCHASING THE ACTUAL GAME

ALSO ESPECIALLY IF DONE ENTIRELY IN HOUSE THE APP REPRESENTS ADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAMS FOR GAME COMPANIES DESIGNERS OF AN ALREADY ESTABLISHED PRODUCTION WHICH HELPS THE INDUSTRY IN VARIOUS WAYS

IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE APP I MAY NOT HAVE EVER BOUGHT ANY OF THE ASCENSION GAMES I WASN'T OVERLY CONVINCED BY VIDEOS BUT MINUTES INTO PLAYING THE APP I ORDERED A PHYSICAL COPY I'M STILL THE ONLY ONE I KNOW PERSONALLY THE OWNS ANY OF THE ASCENSION SETS

AFTER PLAYING SAN JUAN IT'S MOVED ONTO MY WISELIEST SPLENDOR IS ALSO INTERESTING TO ME FOR THOSE TIMES MORE CASUAL GAMERS STOP IN THANKS TO HAVING PLAYED IT ON MY PHONE INGENIOUS ALSO GOT MY ATTENTION AFTER PLAYING THE APPARENTLY

SO I THINK IT PROBABLY HELPS
I THINK TECHNOLOGY IS JUST A BOW IN THE QUIVER WE ARE CONTINUALLY BECOMING MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY DEPENDANT AND THUS TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO PLAY MORE OF A ROLE IN THINGS LIKE BOARDGAMES SOME WILL USE IT WELL AND SOME WILL NOT I DO THINK HOWEVER THAT BOARDGAMES DESPITE OF THIS FACT WILL MAINTAIN BEING AN ESCAPE FROM OUR TYPICAL TECHNOLOGY SATURATED LIVES
I KEEP ALL MY DICE IN THE BAG OF HOLDING THAT CAME WITH THIS NOT VERY PRACTICAL OR PRETTY BUT I LIKE IT

FOR DICE MASTERS I USE PLANO TRAYS
IT'S NOT THE BEST IF YOU WANT TO FEATURE THE DICE BUT MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE A TON OF MASON JARS FROM OUR WEDDING AND WE USE A FEW AS DICE STORAGE YOU CAN SORT AND STILL SEE THEM NOT FOR EVERYONE I KNOW BUT THAT'S MY TWO CENTS
I STORE MINE IN A GLASS CONTAINER HETP I PICKED UP AT BUT I'M SURE MOST OTHER HOBBY CRAFT STORES WILL HAVE SIMILAR OFFERINGS JUST BE SURE TO GET ONE WITH THICKER GLASS IT LOOKS NICE ON THE GAME SHELVES IS A CONVERSATION PIECE AND IT'S EASY TO FIND AND PLUCK OUT THE DICE YOU NEED
I REMEMBER SEEING A DICE BAG WITH SECTIONS INSIDE IT DOES ANYONE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
I REALLY WISH PANDEMIC WITH EXPANSIONS REPLACED PANDEMIC LEGACY IT HAS MANY OF THE ELEMENTS OF LEGACY ALREADY AND MUCH MORE REPLAY VALUE HOWEVER I KNOW MOST PEOPLE PREFER TO PLAY A GAME A COUPLE DOZEN TIMES AND THEN BE DONE WITH IT FEW SEEM TO LIKE TO PLAY THE SAME GAME OVER AND OVER AND OVER UNLESS IT IS A MINUTE LIGHT FILLER

I'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE VERY SIMILAR LISTINGS COMBINED I DON'T THINK THROUGH THE AGES SHOULD HAVE TWO ENTRIES FOR EACH VERSION EVEN THROUGH THERE WERE SOME RULE CHANGES

GAMES I'D LIKE TO SEE BREAK IN I'D LOVE TO SEE CLASSICS LIKE GO OR CHESS GET IN THERE BUT THE MODERN BOARDGAMING HOBBY HAS A STRONG BIAS AGAINST THESE AND CLASSIC FAMILY GAMES LIKE CLUE PLUS WARGAMES

WHAT WOULD I PUT IN THERE I'D LIKE TO SEE THE GMT COIN SERIES IN THERE BUT I GUESS IT STILL HASN'T CAUGHT ON LIKE I WOULD HOPE PLAY TIME IS PROBABLY ONE MAJOR FACTOR EVEN THOUGH CUBA LIBRE TAKES ABOUT AS LONG AS A PLAYER GAME OF AGRICOLA OR LONGER POSSIBLY AND IS ABOUT AS COMPLEX IN RULES

I'D LOVE TO SEE PAX PAMIR MAKE IT IN THERE ALSO BUT PEOPLE ACRE ALSO AFRAID OF SIERRA MADRE GAMES TITLES PAX PAMIR PLAYS IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND IS AN INTERESTING TAKE ON EMPIRE BUILDING YOU AREN'T THE POWER YOU ARE IN THEIR SHADOWS AND TRYING TO CURRY FAVOR WITH THE GIANTS OF THE AGE SOLID EASY TO READ DESIGN SMOOTH GAMEPLAY INTERESTING CHOICES TABLEAU BUILDING COMPONENTS HIGH PORTABILITY ALL REASONS WHY IT DESERVES TO BE HIGHER THAN HOWEVER DIFFICULT TO READ RULEBOOKS SIMPLER THAN THROUGH THE AGES THOUGH SMALL PRINT RUNS AND LACK OF DISTRIBUTION TO GAME STORES PROBABLY KEEP THIS GAME OBSCURE

THE TOP OF THIS SUB AFFECTS ME IN NO WAY SO I DON'T CARE WHAT'S ON IT LOL I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER EVEN LOOKED AT IT


THERE'S AN APP IF YOU DON'T MIND PLAYING ELECTRONICALLY
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF THERE'S NO ISSUE WITH PLAYING BOTH SIDES THOUGH
THERE'S A PDF FILE OVER AT BOARD GAME GEEK THAT HAS THE RULES FOR TWO SOLO VARIANTS

I HAVEN'T TRIED THEM YET BUT I PROBABLY WILL IN THE NEAR FUTURE
WHILE NORMALLY I'M AGAINST SUGGESTING SUCH A THING IN A THREAD LIKE THIS THE PATCHWORK APP IS AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID IOS AND EVEN THE FOSSILS OF WINDOWS PHONES AND IT'S VERY WELL DESIGNED

YOU CAN ALSO DEFINITELY SEARCH BOARDGAMEGEEK FOR SOLO VARIANTS THEIR FORUMS HAVE SOLO VARIANTS FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING
HONESTLY I PREORDERED IT AND CANCELED IT B C ALL THE EXPANSION DOES IS ADD VARIANTS TO BALANCE IT OUT AND SOME MINIATURES I FEEL LIKE THE GAME IS ALREADY WELL BALANCED W RUSHING ADDED
HEY

AVALON AND BANG OR BANG DICE HAVE A HIDDEN TRAITOR MECHANIC AND ARE SHORT AND SWEET

COUP AND LOVE LETTERS ARE SHORT AND FUN NO TRAITOR MECHANIC

PANDEMIC AND FORBIDDEN ISLAND ARE BOTH CO-OP ROLE BASED GAMES THEY ARE LONGER BUT I FIND YOU CAN HELP A YOUNGER KID THROUGH A CO-OP EASIER
DEAD OF WINTER IT IS CO-OP WITH EVERYONE WORKING TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL THESE GOALS VARY IN LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY THEN THERE IS THE OPTION FOR EACH PLAYER TO ALSO HAVE A SECRET OBJECTIVE THIS MEANS EACH PLAYER NEEDS THE COMMON GOAL TO BE REACHED PLUS THEIR SECRET OBJECTIVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL TO WIN THERE IS ALSO AN OPTION TO ADD IN A BETRAYER THE BETRAYER WILL BE TRYING TO SABOTAGE THE COMMON GOAL IT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD GAME THAT WOULD BE EASY TO WALK A NEW PERSON THROUGH
I THINK SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT IS YOUR GAME

I DON'T KNOW OF ANY GAME THAT HAS ALL OF THE POINTS YOU SUGGEST BUT IT HITS A LOT OF THEM

SIMPLE ENOUGH RULES FOR A GROUP OF THREE TO FIVE KIDS ABOUT YEARS OLD

CHECK BOX SAYS AGES AND IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING FOR A YEAR OLD BUT I THINK YOU CAN PROBABLY GET IT TO WORK THE ACTIONS ARE PRETTY SIMPLE AND IF THEY CAN UNDERSTAND POKER HANDS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO COMPLETE OBJECTIVES

TRAITOR MECHANIC

CHECK SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT IS ONE OF THE FIRST HIDDEN TRAITOR GAMES AND I THINK IT HOLDS UP FAIRLY WELL EVEN TODAY THERE'S LESS FOR THE TRAITOR TO DO IN THIS ONE THAN IN MOST BUT THAT MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER FOR A GROUP WITH YOUNGER KIDS

DIFFERENT ROLES TEAMS CHEF SABOTEUR ETC

CHECK EVERY PLAYER CHOOSES A KNIGHT FROM ARTHURIAN LEGEND TO PLAY AND EACH KNIGHT HAS A SPECIAL POWER ADDITIONALLY YOU CAN QUEST TO FIND ARMOR THE HOLY GRAIL OR EXCALIBUR AND THEY GRANT SMALL BUT USEFUL POWERS TO THE PLAYER WHO ACQUIRES THEM

OPTION TO PLAY MULTIPLE ROUNDS IN SUCCESSION WITH POINTS CARRYING OVER TO NEXT ROUND

NOTHING REALLY HERE UNFORTUNATELY BUT THE GAME IS REASONABLY LONG AND INVOLVES MULTIPLE QUESTS SO IT SHOULD KEEP PEOPLE BUSY FOR A WHILE

OPTION TO PLAY WITH MORE PLAYERS WHEN GUESTS ARRIVE WITHOUT SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON EXPLAINING RULES

CHECK THIS IS WHERE THE GAME REALLY SETS ITSELF APART IT'S THE ONLY GAME I'M AWARE OF THAT PERMITS PEOPLE TO JOIN WHILE THE GAME IS IN PROGRESS THERE ARE RULES THAT DESCRIBE HOW TO HANDLE PLAYERS DROPPING OUT OR JOINING IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME

CLEAR AND SELF-EXPLAINING RULES

THIS IS A MATTER OF OPINION I THINK THE RULES ARE PRETTY CLEAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD THE BOARD HAS PLACES FOR WHERE YOU PLAY CARDS TO WORK ON QUESTS AND ALL OF THE INFORMATION FOR HOW TO PLAY IS WRITTEN ON THE BOARD ON THE CARDS YOU DRAW OR ON THE CHARACTER SHEETS THAT SAID I THINK AT LEAST ONE FULL READ THROUGH OF THE RULES AND QUEST BOOK IS NECESSARY AND THEN THE MARKINGS ON THE REST OF THE GAME CAN SERVE AS REMINDERS
COUP

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF BEST WITH PLAYERS

INVASION EVASION

U GETINFO
I'VE REALLY ONLY NOTICED THAT THE REPEATED FISH HARVEST CARD IS OP BASICALLY WINS YOU THE GAME IF YOU CAN SAVE ALL THE FISH UNTIL THE LAST ROUND AND STACK THEM ON A HIGHER TIER

YOU CAN DEFINITELY WIN IF YOU WANT TO MOSTLY EXPLORE BUT YOU NEED TO BE HAVING SUCCESSES AND SHOOT FOR THE CARD THAT GIVES YOU VICTORY POINTS FOR EACH OUTPOST YOU HAVE BEST TO THINK AHEAD AND START ADDING THINGS UP EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS IN WHAT CARDS THEY WANT NEXT AND LIKELY WON'T SABOTAGE YOU UNLESS THEY ARE ALSO COUNTING YOUR POINTS

BUT LIKE MOST STORY TELLING GAMES IT'S ABOUT THE ADVENTURE AND THE CHARACTERS YOU DEVELOPE
MY ADVICE TO YOU IS GENERAL DON'T ASSUME THAT ONE STRATEGY IS OP AFTER A SINGLE GAME I HAVE HAD SURPRISE VICTORIES WHERE I MOSTLY DID EXPLORATION AND I'VE ALSO SEEN WINS WITH A BALANCED APPROACH THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IMO IS TO PLAN AROUND THE BIG VP CARDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE
I'VE WON BY GETTING THE CARD THAT GIVES BONUSES TO HAVING VILLAGERS AND BUYING UP VILLAGERS EVERY ROUND ONLY WENT TO THE CAVE A COUPLE OF TIMES AND GOT A FEW THINGS BUT VILLAGERS WERE MY BIG POINT MAKER AROUND I HAD OTHER THINGS GOING ON BUT THAT PUT ME OVER THE TOP COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES WORK WELL BUT YOU ARE RIGHT BEING REALLY DIVERSE WON'T WIN YOU THE GAME AS OFTEN AS OTHER GAMES REWARD THAT STRATEGY
I'VE PLAYED ABOVE AND BELOW QUITE A BIT AND I'VE NEVER REALLY FELT ONE STRATEGY WAS BETTER THAN ANOTHER THIS IS MOSTLY DUE TO EACH GAME HAVING DIFFERENT THINGS AVAILABLE INITIALLY IF THE USE A VILLAGER RIGHT AFTER RECRUITING BUILDING SHOWS UP EXPLORING AND GETTING THE POINTS PER VILLAGER CARD IS VERY POWERFUL IF STEADY GOODS GENERATORS SHOW UP EARLY HARVESTING IS PRETTY POWERFUL

DUE TO ITS NATURE AS A CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE STYLE GAME ABOVE AND BELOW HAS VERY GO WITH THE FLOW GAMEPLAY SOMETIMES EXPLORATION WILL GET YOU SOMETHING AMAZING OTHER TIMES NOT SO MUCH BUT IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS WORTH DELVING INTO THE CAVES IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO ON YOUR TURN
COINCIDENTALLY I JUST PLAYED ABOVE AND BELOW FOR THE FIRST TIME EARLIER TODAY AND I HAD THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE SO YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE OF US EXPLORED A LOT AND GAINED NOTHING MUCH WHEREAS THE PERSON WHO STAYED BACK AND HARVESTED WON WITH POINTS
TALES OF THE ARABIAN KNIGHTS

IS IT ON A REVERSE CRUSADING THEME
THE GAME IS A MEDIOCRE AT BEST EURO WITH THE GIMMICK OF THE STORY BOOK THROWN IN DON'T SWEAT IT TO MUCH ALSO I DON'T KNOW WHAT STEEPLE PLACEMENT IS IF YOU MEAN WORKER PLACEMENT AS IN THE GAME MECHANIC THIS GAME IS GENERALLY INTO THAT CATEGORY
FROM THE DEMO I PLAYED AT BG CON THIS REALLY IS ONLY SOMETHING THAT LIKELY HAPPENS WHEN THE LAST TURN IS TRIGGERED BY TROOP DEPLOYMENT SINCE THE TURN ISN'T ENDED THE SECOND THE LAST TROOP IS DEPLOYED IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THE PLAYER WHO TRIGGERS IT WILL HAVE A SPARE POINT OF INFLUENCE OR TWO AFTER DEPLOYING THEIR LAST TROOP AND THE VP IS A WAY OF AWARDING THE RESIDUAL AFFECT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE WITH A FEW EXTRA UNITS
THIS IS ONLY FOR THE PLAYER TRIGGERING THE END GAME EITHER BY BUYING A CARD AND NO REFILL IS MADE OR BY DEPLOYING ALL THE TROOPS ONCE YOU'VE DEPLOYED ALL YOUR TROOPS THOUGH YOUMAY STILL HAVE SOME UNPLAYED CARDS IN YOUR HAND THIS IS SAYING THAT IF THOSE CARDS GIVE YOU STRENGTH POINTS DDK WHAT THEY'RE CALLED IN THE GAME WE JUST CALL THEM STRENGTH AND BUY POWER OR HAVE A DEPLOY X SOLDIERS YOU'LL GET VICTORY POINTS EQUAL TO THAT

EXAMPLE YOU DEPLOYED ALL YOUR TROOPS BUT YOU STILL HAVE 2 HOUSE GUARD CARDS LEFT IN YOUR HAND EACH WORTH STRENGTH POINTS YOU WOULD GET POINTS INSTEAD OF DEPLOYING
I'VE ONLY PLAYED THE GAME WITH PLAYERS AND HAVE EXPERIENCE OR DESIRE TO PLAY IT WITH LESSER PLAYER COUNTS BUT I'VE NOW PLAYED IT QUITE A FEW TIMES

I CAN SEE WHERE THE CRITICISMS ARE COMING FROM AND I AGREE ON THE VARIANCE OF YELLOW RED CARD STRENGTH AND POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE OF THE 1ST BREN BUT I THINK THE REST ARE EXAGGERATED AND I ALSO THINK HE DIDN'T HIGHLIGHT PARTS OF THE GAME THAT I THINK ARE THE MOST INTERESTING AND FUN I ASSUME DUE TO WANTING TO KEEP THE REVIEW TIMELY OR ONE OF THE MOST GLARING PROBLEMS AND I'M SAYING THIS AS SOMEONE WHO'S SUBSCRIBED AND REALLY LOVE CONTENT SO DON'T TAKE THIS AS ME SHITTING ON HIM OR ANYTHING

ALMOST ALL GAMES SUFFER FROM THE PROBLEM OF A POOR PLAYER POTENTIALLY HELPING OTHERS IT'S A PROBLEM BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY LARGE ONE AND I ALSO DON'T REALLY SEE A WAY AROUND IT WITHOUT SACRIFICING A LOT OF THE REST OF THE GAME I ALSO DON'T SEE TOO BIG OF AN ISSUE WITH PURE ATTRITION COMBAT UNLESS YOU HAVE POOR PLAYERS SO THESE TWO IDEAS ARE LINKED AND DON'T REALLY MATTER FOR ME TO CONTINUE WITH THIS THE PROBLEM OF A NEW TERRITORY BEING TOO STRONG AND THAT PEOPLE CAN'T GET TO IT IS ALSO A PROBLEM OF POOR PLAY SINCE THE BREN NOT THE ONE PLAYING THE EXPLORE CARD IS THE ONE WHO GETS TO CHOOSE ITS LOCATION DEPENDING ON GAME STATE THE BREN MAY WANT TO PLACE IT IN THE THICK OF THINGS OR OFF IN LAND WITH RISKS AND BENEFITS FOR EACH SO I REALLY THINK THE QUALMS WITH THE GAME MOSTLY BOIL DOWN TO BAD PLAYERS CAN RUIN IT WHICH I AGREE WITH I JUST DON'T SEE THAT AS A REAL FAULT OF THE GAME

I ALSO THINK THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE GAME ISN'T REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE MOST IMPORTANT WAY A ROUND IS PLAYED OUT AFTER THE DRAFTING ISN'T JUST THE WAY YOU CAN READ THE DRAFT AND WHO WANTS WHAT BUT TO ME IS ACTUALLY BY HOW PASSING YOUR TURN AND THE PRETENDER TOKEN WORKS INSTEAD OF PLAYING A CARD THE PLAYER CAN PASS THIS TURN BUT THIS DOES NOT RESTRICT THEM FROM PLAYING CARDS IN A LATER ROUND SINCE THIS LETS PLAYERS BE REACTIONARY PASSING YOUR TURN IS USUALLY THE BEST THING YOU DO RESULTING IN A GAME OF CHICKEN IF YOU THINK SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO WANT TO CONTINUE PLAYING CARDS YOU SHOULD ALMOST ALWAYS PASSIVE THE BREN MUST START THE ROUND PLAYING A CARD SO PEOPLE WANT TO PLAY A CARD TO CATCH UP TO THE BREN BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO PASS THEIR TURN SO THEY CAN RESPOND TO OTHER PLAYER'S ACTIONS BUT IF EVERYONE PASSES THEN THE BREN OR WHOEVER HAS PLAYED THE MOST CARDS AT THAT TIME CAN PASS AS WELL ENDING THE ROUND AND GAINING PLAYED CARD ADVANTAGE IN THE SAME VEIN FOR SOMEONE TO WIN THEY MUST SPEND THEIR ACTION TO TAKE A PRETENDER TOKEN WHICH LETS THEM WIN NEXT TURN IF THEY STILL MEET THE WIN CONDITIONS THIS PROMOTES SOMEONE PASSING THEIR TURN EVEN FURTHER TO BOTH WAIT TO SEE IF SOMEONE ELSE TAKES THE PRETENDER TOKEN BUT ALSO TO PUSH BACK THEIR OWN TAKING OF THE TOKEN SO THEY HAVE LESS OF A TARGET ON THEIR BACK WE HAVE HAD A TON OF ROUNDS THAT END WITH EVERYONE HOLDING SEVERAL CARDS OR SOMEONE ACTIVELY NOT TAKING A PRETENDER TOKEN SINCE MANY OF THE KEY CARDS THAT COULD STOP THEM HAVEN'T BEEN PLAYED YET SO THEY JUST PASS TO SEE IF THE SITUATION GETS BETTER A FEW THINGS PROMOTE NOT PASSING NAMELY THE ATTACK CARD AND THE CARD BUT THE TENSION OF PASSING IS STILL REALLY PREVALENT THAT INTERACTION TO ME IS AN INCREDIBLY KEY COMPONENT OF WHAT MAKES ANIS GREAT AND I REALLY HAVEN'T HEARD MANY REVIEWERS TOUCH ON IT IT MADE ME TO RULE BOOK TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD THE WAY PASSING WORKS BUT THERE'S EVEN A HINT BOX DETAILING IT

I DO THINK THE MOST GLARING PROBLEM IS WITH THE RULE SPECIFICALLY FOR WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF UNITS WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF UNITS YOU GET TO NOW PLACE 2 MORE UNITS WHERE EVER YOU WANT AND CONTINUE WITH THE ROUND THIS ENDED UP BEING EXTREMELY EXPLOITABLE UNDER CERTAIN SCENARIOS BOTH EARLY TO REINFORCE REPOSITION AT LOW COST AND LATE IF SANCTUARIES ARE PLACED PRIMARILY ON LOCATIONS SO WE ENFORCED THE OF YOU ONLY GETTING TO DO THIS DURING THE ASSEMBLY PHASE THE BEGINNING OF THE ROUND THIS MIGHT PUNISH POOR PLAYERS OR THE EXTREMELY UNLUCKY EARLY GAME BUT WE THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARY

BUT THE REAL BIGGEST ISSUE IS THAT THE MINIATURES ARE MADE OUT OF FLIMSY MATERIAL AND THEIR SPEARS GET BENT AND THE WOMEN ARE STUCK IN A PERMANENT BOW HALACHA I WISH I COULD PAY A BIT MORE FOR HIGHER QUALITY ONES
HIS MAJOR COMPLAINT ABOUT CONFLICT DOES NOT HOLD MUCH GROUND TO ME I'VE PLAYED GAMES OF ANIS AND THIS WAR OF ATTRITION CAN BE BY PASSED WITH PROPER CARD USAGE DRAFTING OR THE CHOICE TO WITHDRAW FROM A CONFLICT

I ALSO DISAGREE WITH HIS COMPLAINT ABOUT THE BREN STAYING BREN THAT WILL ONLY OCCUR IN HIGHER PLAYER COUNTS IF THEY FORTIFY ONE AREA HOLDING THEM BACK FROM ACHIEVING ANY OF THE THREE WINNING CONDITIONS

IT'S NOT A PERFECT GAME BUT I BELIEVE THE COMPLAINTS ARE OVER EXAGGERATED IF YOU WANT AN ON THE RAILS THE GAME DICTATES EVERY LITTLE THING YOU DO TYPE GAME THEN THIS ISN'T FOR YOU BUT IF YOU WANT A GAME OF REACTIONS WHERE THE PLAYERS AROUND YOU AND THEIR CHOICES DICTATE WHAT YOU DO THEN IT'S A VERY GOOD GAME
FOR AS MUCH AS YOU HE DOESN'T WANT TO COMPARE IT TO DUDES ON A MAP GAMES HE CERTAINLY SPENT THE WHOLE TIME CRITICIZING IT BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT'S A ON A MAP GAME

THE GAME IS WAY MORE THAT TROOP AREA CONTROL ORIENTED THE PROBLEM'S WITH THE BRENN BEING ABLE TO HOLD TOO EASILY DON'T RING TRUE OF MY PLAYS IF THE GROUP SEES YOU GETTING TOO STRONG THEY STRIKE YOU DOWN IT FEELS LIKE HE WANTS THE GAME TO BE COMPLETELY DETERMINISTIC WHICH WOULD BE BORING AS HELL I DO SEE THE CRITICISM THAT SOME OF THE EPIC TALE CARDS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT IN AN HOUR LONG GAME I THINK IT'S FORGIVABLE FOR THIS LEVEL OF RANDOMNESS

FOR EXAMPLE IN SCYTHE THE ENCOUNTER CARDS ARE WAY MORE IMPACTFUL AND THE GAME IS CLOSER TO HOURS WHERE IT FEELS LIKE YOU CAN WIN OR LOSE BASED ON THE ENCOUNTER CARDS SECRET OBJECTIVE CARDS THAT COMES CLOSER TO UNFORGIVABLE TO ME
FIRST OFF AND I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE LOVE YOUR WORK

REGARDING THE ASPECT OF THE BAD PLAYER RUINING THE GAME STATE BY TO AN OTHERWISE INCONSPICUOUS FIGHT IS THERE A WAY THAT SEEMS TO DIFFERENTIATE THIS IN ANIS FROM OTHER GAMES BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT I'VE BEEN RAILROADED INTO DISADVANTAGEOUS POSITIONS BY PLAYERS THAT SIMPLY DIDN'T KNOW THE OPTIMUM STRATEGIES IN PRETTY MUCH ANY COAM GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED NOT SAYING YOU'RE WRONG AND I FORGIVE YOU BUT I'M JUST REALLY CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOU CONCLUDE THIS BAD SORT OF PLAY IS THE FAULT OF THE GAME AND NOT THE PLAYERS WITH THE WHOLE SUBGENRE AS A BACKDROP
I FEEL LIKE I AM IN THE MINORITY WHEN I SAY THAT I FIND THE ARTWORK TO BE HIDEOUS I KNOW THAT GAMEPLAY IS ALL THAT MATTERS AT THE END OF THE DAY BUT MAN I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL TURNED OFF FROM THE GAME BASED ON LOOKS ALONE
GAMES

MPH DAMN IT ALL
I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE CRITICAL RESPONSE WITH THESE HYPED GAMES MOST REVIEWS DO NOT EXAMINE THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS BEYOND WHETHER HE OR SHE ENJOYED THEM

I AM GLAD TO HAVE BAILED ON THE ANIS PREORDER LAST MONTH ON A GUT FEELING OF THE MASSIVE HYPE BOARD GAMES ARE IN THIS ODD SPACE BETWEEN COLLECTABLES AND SABLES BECAUSE OF THIS DUALITY MOST HOT NEW GAMES END UP FEELING INCREDIBLY UNDERWHELMING THANK YOU FOR THE MUCH NEEDED SOBER VIEW
AGREE FIRST PLAY HATED IT THOUGHT ABOUT IT SAW SOME POTENTIAL AND GAVE IT ANOTHER PLAY I ENJOYED IT BUT THE ENDING ALWAYS FEELS LIKE IT'S NEVER EXCITING MY GAMES ALWAYS SEAMED TO END IN SOMEONE KING MAKING OR A LONG DRUG OUT FIGHT WITH THE LEADER FINALLY WINING AFTER SEVERAL TURNS NEVER IN DANGER OF LOOSING JUST HAVING HIS WIN PROLONGED ENOUGH FOR THE GAME TO GO ANOTHER ROUND THAT BEING SAID I BOUGHT SOMEONES USED COPY FOR THE ART AND OCCASIONAL PLAY IT'LL WORK FOR A CHANGE OF PACE ON THE DUDES ON A MAP GAMES I OWN EMET IS STILL MY GO TO
WOW FOR THE PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND JOKE PEI REPRESENT
MY FIRST GAME WITH THIS WAS A PERSONAL DISASTER BECAUSE I WAS NEVER ABLE TO MUSTER FORCES WITH THE PEOPLE CARDS BEING DRAFTED BEFORE I EVER HAD A CHANCE TO GRAB THEM

I HATED THIS GAMES FIRST PLAY THROUGH I GUESS ILL GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT BECAUSE I TOO COULD SEE WHERE THE REVIEWER SAW ACTUAL DEPTH OF THE GAME

CONVERSELY BLOODRAGE WENT GREAT EVERY TIME I'VE PLAYED IT PEOPLE PICK IT UP QUICKLY GET THE THEMATIC ELEMENTS FOR THE VARIOUS GODS AND ARE ABLE TO CRAFT AN IDENTITY FOR THEIR ARMY ANIS HAD NONE OF THAT

HOWEVER I INTEND TO GIVE IT ANOTHER CRACK TO SEE IF IT IS STILL SUPER WEIRD
ANIS IS GOOD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I'VE BEEN REALLY ENJOYING THIS LIST IT'S VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHER DICE TOWER FOLKS
I'M IN LOVE
I WAS NEVER A FAN OF DICE TOWER AND THEIR TASTES UNTIL NOW GOOD JOB
QUARTO CMON COOL BUT IT DOESNT TAKE VERY LONG BEFORE YOU START GETTING CAT'S GAMES WITH IT
SOME COOL OUT OF THE ORDINARY PICKS BUT ALSO JUST A BUNCH OF CRAP IN THERE OVERALL COOL LIST THOUGH
WE ARE ULTRA COMPETITIVE AND ANY GAME WHERE YOU CAN BETRAY PEOPLE WOULD CERTAINLY BE A PLUS

USUALLY IT'S PEOPLE FOR ABOUT HOURS

RESISTANCE AVALON

EASY TO LEARN EASY TO PLAY MINUTE ROUNDS MEANS IF SOMEONE SCREWS UP IT'S TRIVIAL TO MOVE ON OR RESET WITH MINIMAL TIME LOST CHANGING ALLEGIANCES WITH A CENTRAL TRAITOR MECHANIC ALONG WITH DIFFERENT SPECIAL ROLES KEEPS THE GAME FRESH AND INTERESTING BEST OF ALL IT'S CHEAP IT'S BETTER THAN THE SIMILAR ONE-NIGHT WEREWOLF GAMES IN THAT THERE ARE LESS ROLES TO FOOL WITH AND THERE IS NO PLAYER ELIMINATION SO FASTER FOR NEW PLAYERS AND EVERYONE GETS TO PLAY THE ENTIRETY OF EVERY GAME

DOWNSIDE IS IT IS GOING TO WORK BEST WITH TO PLAYERS IS OK BUT IS IMO UNPLAYABLE IT REQUIRES MINIMUM TO PLAY I THINK IT WORKS BEST WITH

BONANZA

ANOTHER CHEAPO GAME IT'S BASED ON TRADING CARDS WITH OTHER PLAYERS THIS IS ONE OF MY GAMES TO DATE ABOUT OF THE I'VE SHOWN IT TO HAVE ENDED UP BUYING IT

MINUTE PLAY TIME SCALES DOWN TO OR UP TO VERY PLAYABLE IN YOUR DESIRED PLAYER COUNTS IT'S VERY ENGAGING IN THAT THE PRIMARY MECHANIC IS TRADING CARDS WITH THE OTHER PLAYERS LOTS OF META GAMES THAT CAN BE PLAYED WITH MAKING DEALS AND PLENTY OF BRAGGING RIGHTS WHEN YOU END UP WITH THE BEST SCORE
TRY ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF OR SECRET HITLER
DID YOU MEAN COSMIC ENCOUNTER EACH PLAYER PLAYS AN ALIEN RACE WITH A UNIQUE POWER TRYING TO WHEEL DEAL AND BACKSTAB YOUR WAY TO THE TOP ALSO SEE MY FAVORITE PITCH
DIPLOMACY IS PRETTY GOOD IT IS USUALLY MEANT FOR PEOPLE BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO PLAY WITH IT IS A WAR GAME WHERE YOU CAN BACKSTAB PEOPLE AND MAKE ALLIANCES BE PREPARED FOR A LONG GAME UNLESS YOU CONCEDE TO A CLEAR WINNER GAMES CAN LAST ANYWHERE BETWEEN HOURS
IN THE LAST YEARS THE FOLLOWING GAMES HAVE BEEN GATEWAY GAMES CATAN CARCASSONNE TICKET TO RIDE DOMINION

NOW I DON'T PLAY ANY OF THESE GAMES WITH MY FRIENDS ANY MORE THERE ARE BETTER GAMES OUT THERE IN MY OPINION HOWEVER THESE FOUR GAMES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF BOARDGAMES TO MANY MANY PEOPLE IF YOU LIKE THEM THERE IS A WHOLE WORLD OF BOARD GAMES JUST WAITING FOR YOU
I WOULD RECOMMEND CATAN DOMINION TICKET TO RIDE OR SMASH UP I GOT ADDICTED TO BOARD GAMES PLAYING SMASH UP AND THEN DOMINION WHICH IS WHY I RECOMMEND THEM BUT CATAN AND TICKET TO RIDE ARE BOTH EASY TO GET INTO
BANG DICE

THERE ARE ROLES ALL WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES REVOLVING AROUND SCREWING HELPING THE OTHER ROLES HOWEVER ONLY ONE ROLE IS PUBLIC THE REST ARE SECRET SO IT'S HIGHLY REPAYABLE AND VERY LIVELY SHOOTING EACH OTHER IF YOU HAVE USE THEIR FOAM PISTOLS FOR PROPS

ALL AVAILABLE ACTIONS ARE ON THE DICE SO EXPLAINING IS VERY EASY AND ROUNDS GO VERY FAST IN CONTRAST TO THE CARD GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO PULL ONE OF EACH CARD AND EXPLAIN EACH ONE AS WELL AS WORRY ABOUT HAND MANAGEMENT WITH BIGGER GROUPS WAITING FOR YOUR TURN TO COME AROUND CAN TAKE SOME TIME BUT YOU HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN DEBATING WHAT A PERSON'S TURN SAYS ABOUT THE ROLE THEY MAY HAVE SO IT'S VERY ENGAGING

IMO IT DOESN'T PLAY WELL AT LESS THAN SO NOT PERFECT ALSO INVOLVES PLAYER ELIMINATION SO SOMEONE CAN END UP SITTING OUT OF A LOT OF A GAME

EDIT CLARITY RULESCHECK
ME AND A COUPLE OF FRIENDS WHO ARE ALSO HEAVY INTO VIDEOGAMES HAVE BEEN PLAYING COUP FOR SEVERAL HOURS AT A TIME I SAY IT IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BUT IT IS ALSO NOT JUST DOWN TO LUCK EITHER TRICKING YOUR OPPONENTS CALLING THEIR BLUFF ETC NEVER GETS OLD AND YOU GET BETTER AT IT WITH TIME IT CAN EVEN BE DONE WITH A NORMAL DECK OF CARDS IF YOU WANT THOUGH I'D RECOMMEND BUYING THE ORIGINAL CARDS THERE'S AN EXPANSION THAT ADDS A NEW CARD AS WELL WHICH ADDS EVEN MORE WAYS OF PLAYING ON TOP OF THE BASE GAME
LOVE LETTER RESISTANCE AVALON OR COUP WORK WELL FOR BOARD GAME BEGINNERS THEY ARE EASY TO LEARN AND VERY FUN TO PLAY
CHECK OUT RISK OR EVEN GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME THERES PLENTY OF BACK STABBING TO BE DONE THERE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

IF YOU GET ACRYLIC HEXAGONS THEN HE CAN TAKE A DRY ERASE MARKER AND CHANGE THEM MANY TIMES OF COURSE THEY CAN SMUDGE OFF AND YOU NEED TO HIDE THEM SINCE YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THEM BUT IT COULD BE USEFUL IF HE'S CHANGING THEM A LOT
IF YOU LIKE 2 PLAYER GAMES I'D RECOMMEND HOLMES SHERLOCK MELCROFT NOT A MYSTERY SOLVING GAME BUT AN EASY TO LEARN AND STRATEGIC SET COLLECTING GAME A GAME TAKES MINUTES
TICKET TO RIDE NORDIC COUNTRIES IS A GREAT GAME FOR A PAIR AT THE ENTRY LEVEL IF IT'LL PRIMARILY BE THE TWO OF YOU IT'S BETTER THAN USA EUROPE FOR 2 AND CAN PLAY A 3RD

EVOLUTION IS A GREAT CARD GAME AT ANY PLAYER COUNT EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND HAS EXPANSIONS TO SUPPORT IT IF YOU LIKE IT

SPLENDOR IS WORTH LOOKING INTO AS AN ENTRY LEVEL GAME ABOUT MAKING AN EFFICIENT USE OF YOUR RESOURCES AND CARDS

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY MIGHT BE HARD TO UNDERSTAND AT FIRST BUT IT IS THE BEST DICE GAME I'VE PLAYED IT'S THE HARDEST ON THIS LIST BUT IF YOU DON'T UNDERESTIMATE YOURSELF YOU WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM IT'S MY FIANCEE AND MY MOST PLAYED GAME
MY WIFE AND I ARE ALSO JUST GETTING INTO BOARD GAMES

WE'VE PICKED UP PANDEMIC AND PANDEMIC CONTAGION WHICH ARE BOTH AWESOME AND FUN FOR FOLKS CONTAGION IS A GAME AND PLAYS A BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN VANILLA PANDEMIC THOUGH JUST FYI

WE ALSO PICKED UP WHICH I FEEL LIKE IS A BIT MUCH FOR US BUT WE'RE STILL HAVING A TON OF FUN WITH IT IT ALSO APPEALS TO MY INNER STAR WARS COLLECTOR NERD SO I'M DIGGING IT IF ONLY FOR ALL THE TINY SHIPS

WE PLAYED FLASHPOINT FIRE RESCUE TODAY AT A SHOP AND ENJOYED THAT AS WELL

FOR MORE PARTY GAME STUFF WE'VE GOT EXPLODING KITTENS AND WE DIDN'T PLATIEST THIS AT ALL BOTH ARE GOOD CASUAL PARTY GAMES THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED IN MINUTES
PATCHWORK IS A GREAT 2 PLAYER GAME

SUSHI GO

FORBIDDEN DESERT

SPLENDOR

TRURO

I MOSTLY PLAY WITH JUST MY WIFE ALTHOUGH WE PREFER GAMES WITH SOME MEAT TO THEM

OUR FAVORITES

TROYES
PLAYERS THIS WILL BE BACK IN PRINT EARLY MANY SAY IT'S AT ITS BEST WITH PLAYERS BUT IT PLAYS WONDERFULLY WITH JUST TWO AS WELL

GINKGOPOLIS
PLAYERS THIS IS SADLY OUT OF PRINT INDEFINITELY SO NOT A GREAT RECOMMENDATION I KNOW WE JUST LOVE IT SO MUCH FOR THE RECORD I WOULD NEVER WANT TO PLAY WITH OR IT IS PERFECT WITH 2

CASTLES OF BURGUNDY
PLAYERS EVERYONE AND THEIR MOM LIKES TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO NEW PLAYERS LOOKING FOR A NICE EUROGAME FOR TWO DESPITE READING TIME AND TIME AGAIN HOW GREAT IT IS I HADN'T ACTUALLY PLAYED IT UNTIL TWO WEEKS AGO IT DOES LIVE UP TO THE HYPE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED NOT MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE BUT VERY GOOD

FIVE TRIBES
PLAYERS I LOVE PLAYING THIS WITH TWO EACH PLAYER TAKES TWO TURNS EACH ROUND SINCE YOU BID FOR TURN ORDER THIS MEANS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GO FOUR TIMES IN A ROW IF YOU SEE THAT MANY GOOD SETUPS OR MOVES YOU WANT TO TAKE BEFORE YOUR OPPONENT DOES IN SUMMARY THE VERSION MAKES THE BIDDING PHASE MORE OF A GAME IN ITSELF

HAGGIS
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A STRAIGHT-UP CARD GAME FOUR SUITS ACES THROUGH KINGS ADA ADA THIS ONE IS EXCELLENT A GAME AND MY WIFE WHO TYPICALLY DESPISES CARD GAMES LOVES IT



YOU'LL ALSO FREQUENTLY SEE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

JAIPUR ALTHOUGH I'D RECOMMEND MORELS AKA FUNGI INSTEAD
ALL CREATURES BIG AND SMALL I THINK THIS IS CURRENTLY OOP BUT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AGAIN SOON
WONDERS DUEL

WHILE NOT MY FAVORITES I CAN CERTAINLY VOUCH THAT ALL ARE QUALITY GAMES
FOR MY WIFE AND ME I'M SORRY NOT SORRY
IF YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF RULE BOOKS AND LEARNING A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME I WOULD SUGGEST ABOVE AND BELOW IT'S A GREAT GAME WITH STORIES AND STRATEGY GREAT ART ASWELL
MY WIFE AND I MET IN A GAMING GROUP AND OUR TYPICAL DATE NIGHT IS DINNER AND BOARD GAMES AMONG OUR FAVORITES

STAR REALMS

CASTLES OF BURGUNDY

PECKING ORDER

RIVALS FOR CATAN

PANDEMIC AND ITS EXPANSIONS

DWARVES MINER

STONE AGE

WONDERS HAS A VARIANT IN THE RULEBOOK WE'RE EAGER TO TRY THE DUELS VERSION

I RECOMMEND FINDING A GAME STORE THAT HOSTS A BOARD GAME NIGHT TO TRY THINGS OUT WITH OTHERS WHO CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS OR FIND A STORE WITH DEMO COPIES AND PLAY A FEW THINGS TOGETHER

EDIT FORMATTING
WELL IF YOU LIKE DARK AND GRITTY GAMES AND ONE THAT WILL KEEP YOU OCCUPIED FOR OVER A YEAR WITH JUST THE BASE SET MIGHT I RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING

DELIVERY TIME IS SUMMER THE DATE IS FOR ALL FUTURE PROJECTS FUNDED BY THE BACKERS WHO OPTED IN

THERE ARE REVIEWS AND ON YOUTUBE YOU CAN WATCH AND GET AN IDEA FROM WE ALSO HAVE A SUBREDDIT IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS
SEEING THAT 2 PLAYER GAMES WOULD BE THE BEST FIT FOR YOU I HIGHLY RECOMMEND WONDERS DUELS IT'S MADE JUST FOR 2 PLAYERS AS THE NAME SUGGESTS AND IS A BLAST TO PLAY IT'S POSSIBLE TO PLAY SEVERAL GAMES ON A NIGHT DUE TO ITS SHORT LENGTH AS WELL YOU DON'T NEED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH ITS PARENT GAME TO ENJOY IT

DEAD OF WINTER IS ALSO A REALLY SOLID GAME ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT ADVISE IT FOR THE CASUAL PLAYER EVEN MY DEDICATED GROUP HAD TROUBLE BEATING JUST A SINGLE SCENARIO IN THAT GAME ALTHOUGH WE MANAGED IT ONCE I'D SAY THE GAME WORKS BETTER WITH MORE THAN 2 PLAYERS SINCE IT INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF A TRAITOR IN THE MIX WHICH REALLY ADDS A LOT TO THE GAME THOUGH IT ALSO MAKES IT EVEN HARDER IF YOU'RE REALLY INTO THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE THEME THOUGH I DON'T SEE WHY YOU WOULDN'T ENJOY IT
DEAD OF WINTER IS GREAT WE INITIALLY PLAYED IT STRAIGHT CO-OP AND PICKED SHORTER EASIER GOALS THEN WE ADDED IN THE SECRET OBJECTIVES AND NOW WE ALWAYS PLAY THE PRISONERS DILEMMA VARIANT IT REALLY IS A FABULOUS CO-OP WITH THE ADDED TWIST OF SECRET OBJECTIVES AND A POTENTIAL BETRAYER
LETTER TYCOON
LEXICON
PAPERBACK
BETTER IS A COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE IDEA YOU MAY GET PEOPLE REPLY TELLING YOU THAT ONE OF THOSE GAMES IS BETTER BUT YOU MIGHT PLAY IT AND FIND OUT THAT YOU HATE IT FOR SOME REASON AND WOULD PREFER THE OTHER ONE

THAT'S LIKE ASKING WHETHER CHOCOLATE OR VANILLA ICE CREAM IS BETTER THEY'RE BOTH GOOD IF YOU LIKE ICE CREAM BUT DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE PREFERENCES FOR DIFFERENT REASONS

AS MUCH HATE AS GAMES LIKE MONOPOLY GETS AROUND HERE YOU'RE STILL ABLE TO FIND PEOPLE WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT THOSE PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT MONOPOLY IS BETTER THAN INSERT POPULAR GAME HERE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYONE HAS TO AGREE WITH THEM
AGRICOLA IS BETTER THAN FIVE TRIBES WHY BECAUSE YOU ARE BUILDING A FOOD PRODUCTION ENGINE
I CAN'T REALLY SAY WHICH IS BETTER AS THAT'S VERY SUBJECTIVE AGRICOLA IS THE HEAVIER GAME OF THE TWO AND REQUIRES YOU TO PLAY A VERY TIGHT GAME YOU'LL BE PUNISHED WITH NEGATIVE POINTS IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE FEED YOUR FAMILY EVERY HARVEST

FIVE TRIBES STARTS OUT WITH TONS OF POSSIBILITY SPACE AND NARROWS AS THE BOARD STARTS TO CLEAR OUT COMPARED TO AGRICOLA WHERE A NEW ACTION SPACE IS OPENING UP EVERY TURN

YOU'RE NOT PUNISHED AS MUCH FOR INEFFICIENCIES IN FIVE TRIBES BUT IT'S HARDER TO BUILD ANY SORT OF REAL ENGINE INSTEAD YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE MANY MANY WAYS YOU CAN SCORE POINTS SEE WHAT YOUR OPPONENTS ARE GOING AFTER AND FIND A NICHE THEY'RE NOT EXPLOITING THAT YOU CAN RIDE TO VICTORY


I AGREE WITH OTHER POSTERS THAT THE ANSWER IS SUBJECTIVE BECAUSE THEY FALL INTO VERY DIFFERENT WEIGHTS AND CATEGORIES BUT I PREFER FIVE TRIBES TO AGRICOLA BECAUSE I ENJOY FINDING THE BEST MOVE ON THE FLY ON A DYNAMIC BOARD AND DEVELOPING A LONGER STRATEGY ACCORDINGLY

AGRICOLA REQUIRES DEEPER STRATEGY WHICH YOU MUST DEVELOP WITHIN YOUR FIRST COUPLE TURNS AND EARLY WILL INVARIABLY LEAD TO A LONG MISERABLE GAME AGAINST CLEAR WINNERS
GAMES OF AGRICOLA AND STILL GOING
I CAN CONFIRM THAT HMS DOLORES IS A LOT OF FUN
I WANT TO PLAY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS JUST TO DO THIS DURING THE GAME

T
I WISH THAT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEAL WERE AVAILABLE IN US
I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SINCE I FIRST HEARD OF IT BUT THE OTHER TWO ARE NOW ON MY RADAR THANKS SU SD

THE ONE THING I'M UNCLEAR ABOUT IN MOD AND I SHOULD PROBABLY JUST READ THE RULEBOOK IS THAT I ASSUME I CAN LIE AND SAY I'M A ROLE REPRESENTED ON THE TABLE RIGHT OR COULD I LIE AND SAY I'M AN UNCOVERED SNITCH TO TRY AND EXTORT SOME MONEY IF THERE WERE TWO DRIVERS ON THE TABLE AND SOMEONE SNITCHED ON A DRIVER TO GET THEM ELIMINATED HOW WOULD THEY CHOOSE WHICH IS WHICH DO YOU POINT AT PLAYER A AND SAY IF YOU'RE THE DRIVER YOU'RE ELIMINATED OR DO YOU JUST POINT AT PLAYER A AND JUST SAY YOU'RE OUT EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHO YOU ARE UNTIL YOU REVEAL
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LOOKS GREAT FUN
ALL OF THEM LOOK INTRIGUING DEAL AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE BOTH ON MY RADAR THANKS TO THEIR HIGHER PLAYER COUNTS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LOOKS VERY INTERESTING GAMEPLAY WISE AND DEAL BEING ABLE TO JUST TAKE AWAY SOMEONE'S OFFERED TAKE SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF FUN IN A GROUP SETTING
BUT HOW DO THEY COMPARE TO INTRIGUE
DAMN NOW I WANT ALL OF THEM
SO AMMA LET YOU FINISH THE REVIEW AND ALL BUT DID ANYONE NOTICE BLOOD BOWL IN THE BACKGROUND I'M CURIOUS HOW THEY WILL RATE IT BEING ONE OF THE SACRED COWS OF GAMING WITH OODLES OF NOSTALGIA FACTOR BUT ALSO THE NEW EDITION BEING SO POOR ON A NUMBER OF LEVELS

IT COULD BE THE GUSHIEST REVIEW EVER OR THE MOST EXCORIATING IF THEY REVIEW IT THAT IS BUT QUINAS WOULDN'T TEASE US LIKE THAT WOULD HE
HMS DOLORES LOOKS LIKE A VERSION OF DEAD LAST RIGHT
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO GET A NEGOTIATION GAME FOR MY COLLECTION I WAS ABOUT TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON DEAD LAST QUINAS JUST MADE MY DECISION MORE DIFFICULT

BASTARD
JEEZ YOU GOT THE REDDIN LINK UP FAST COINCIDENCE OR ARE YOU LINKED TO THE MUSD CREW EITHER WAY GOOD STUFF
HAVING ONLY SEEN AND NEVER PLAYED LEGENDS OF ANDOR MY VOTE GOES TO MICE MYSTICS THE THEME AND CHARACTERS ARE INITIALLY KID FRIENDLY AND KIND OF CUTE THOUGH IT GETS PRETTY THEMATICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DARK AS YOU PROGRESS AND THE GAME TEACHES YOU HOW TO PLAY WITH EACH NEW MISSION I'VE HEARD ANDOR DOES THE SAME BUT MICE MYSTICS FEELS MORE FORGIVING AND BETTER STILL ORGANIC I'D SAY THAT'S A PLUS FOR YOUNGER PLAYERS

I'VE PLAYED MICE MYSTICS WITH MY MOM UP TO BROWNWOOD TALES CHAPTER SO FAR AND HER GAMING LEVEL IS NEARLY THAT OF A YOUNGER GAMER BUT I'VE SEEN HER DEVELOP STRATEGIES AS WE'VE GONE ALONG VERY REWARDING EXPERIENCE FOR ME I TOOK CARE OF THE BOOKKEEPING IN THE INITIAL CHAPTERS BUT NOW SHE UNDERSTANDS HOW TO WORKS SO I LET HER TAKE CONTROL WITH A FEW CORRECTIONS HERE AND THERE IF YOUR DAUGHTER IS SMART SHE'S AHEAD OF MY MOM

NOT TO MENTION THE STORY IS SUPER ENGAGING HEART OF GLOAM CRUSHED ME MOST RULES ARE EASY BECAUSE THEY'RE THEMATIC AND CONSISTENT IF THE RULES CHANGE THERE'S USUALLY A CHAPTER THAT FORCES YOU TO USE THEM FOR THEMATIC REASONS MANY OF THE SCENARIOS PRESENT YOU WITH THIS OR THAT SITUATIONS WHICH BROADENS GAME PLAY MORE THAN YOU'D EXPECT AND THERE'S A FUN LEVEL UP VERSUS RESOURCE SPENDING SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES INTERESTING DECISION MAKING WITHOUT A WHOLE LOT OF PUNISHMENT BY THE TIME YOU'RE DONE WITH BOOK ONE YOU'LL HAVE UP TO SIX UNIQUE CHARACTERS READY TO TACKLE BOOK

BONUS THE MINIATURES AND OTHER COMPONENTS ARE OF FANTASTIC QUALITY AND THE ARTWORK IS BEAUTIFUL
IF SHE CAN PLAY DESCENT THEN MICE AND MYSTICS SHOULD FIT HER NICELY THAT SAID MY BOYS AT THAT AGE DID NOT HAVE THE PATIENCE FOR MICE AND MYSTICS IT COULD TAKE OVER HRS AND COULDN'T KEEP THEIR ATTENTION AT THE TIME THIS IS NOT A KNOCK ON MICE AND MYSTICS BUT JUST WHERE THEY WERE THEN

I ACTUALLY JUST FINISHED A KICKSTARTER FOR A GAME I DESIGNED BECAUSE OF THIS IT IS BASICALLY A LIGHT WEIGHT QUICK PLAY NARRATIVE GAME TARGETED AT FAMILIES IF YOU ARE INTERESTED YOU CAN CHECK OUT OBIT RIDDLE IT ISN'T SHIPPING UNTIL NEXT YEAR BUT YOU MIGHT FIND IT INTERESTING
HI THERE

MY WIFE AND I HAVE PLAYED BOTH GAMES I WOULD SAY MICE AND MYSTICS IS BETTER FOR YOUR SITUATION FOR A CHILD OF THAT AGE THE STORY IS VERY ENGAGING THE CHARACTERS ARE EASY TO CONNECT WITH AND THERE IS SOME GREAT DIALOGUE TO GET HER EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED TO THE MINIATURES ARE NICE WE PAINTED OURS AND THE LENGTH OF THE STORY IS REALLY GREAT FOR THE PRICE WITH MULTIPLE EXPANSIONS AVAILABLE

LEGENDS OF ANDOR IS A GREAT GAME WE JUST GOT IT 2 DAYS AGO AND HAVE PLAYED IT TIMES ALREADY THE MAJOR APPEAL THOUGH IS THE GAMEPLAY FROM A STRATEGY PERSPECTIVE THE LEVEL OF STRATEGY REQUIRED IS HIGHER AND OPTIMALLY YOU WOULD PLAY WITH PEOPLE THE PIECES ARE OK BUT NOTHING LIKE THE APPEAL OF THE MINIATURES IN MICE AND MYSTICS AND THE STORY HAS ONLY GENERIC TOLKIENESQUE ARCHETYPES AND NO REAL CHARACTERS TO CONNECT WITH IT IS MORE OF A STRATEGY GAME THAN AN RPG

SO DEFINITELY MICE AND MYSTICS IS MY VOTE
I HAVE NOT PLAYED EITHER MYSELF BUT I KNOW A KID WHO PLAYED MICE MYSTICS WHEN HE WAS FOUR HE NEEDED HELP BUT GOT THE BASICS I AM SURE A COULD HANDLE IT EASILY ENOUGH
ANDOR IS WAY TOO MUCH IMO
NEVER PLAYED EITHER BUT HAVE HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT MICE AND MYSTICS WITH YOUNGER KIDS IN THAT AGE RANGE
THAT'S THE AGE I GOT TIRED OF RISK AS TOO SIMPLE AND PICKED UP THE ORIGINAL AXIS AND ALLIES MAYBE YOU CAN SPAWN A LIFELONG WARGAMER
WAS CERTAINLY INTERESTED HASSELS REVIEW PUT OUT ON THE BACK-BURNER FOR ME I LIKE THE IDEA BUT THE GAME DIDN'T LOOK CRAZY INTERESTING OUTSIDE OF THE GIMMICK
I REALLY LIKED IT BUT AFTER FOUR PLAYS I KIND OF SAW EVERYTHING IT HAD TO OFFER IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH PICKING UP AT THIS PRICE TO GET A FEW PLAYS IN THE ART AND PRODUCTION QUALITY IS GREAT
QUEEN GAMES IS RUNNING ANOTHER SALE ON AMAZON SO YOU CAN GET A NUMBER OF TITLES FOR UNDER TODAY
DELETED
DELETED
UGH I HATE THIS GAME DON'T JUST BUY IT BECAUSE ITS CHEAP WATCH A VIDEO ON IT OR PLAY IT FIRST
AGREE COMPLETELY GREAT PRICE FOR THIS VERY FUN GAME
I THINK DESCENT IS ABOUT THE CLOSEST I HAVE PLAYED TO WOW WITH THE NEW APP IT IS CO-OP
ANY HARD CO-OP GAME WITH A LOT OF MOVING PARTS

I ACTUALLY THINK OF THE GAMES I'M FAMILIAR WITH SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE BOTH IN TERMS OF THEME FIGHTING A RAID BOSS IS BASICALLY THE PREMISE OF THE GAME TO HOW MANY MECHANISMS YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER DESTROY THE MASK ASAP OR SHE JUST PLAYS HER WHOLE DECK DOES A GREAT JOB OF EMULATING A BOSS FIGHT THERE'S EVEN INFORMAL ROLES FOR THE HERO DECKS WHERE SOME HAVE REDIRECT ALL DAMAGE TO THIS CHARACTER CARDS AND OTHER DECKS ARE FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE BUFFING DAMAGE OR SHUTTING DOWN CARD DRAW FROM VILLAIN AND ENVIRONMENT DECKS

THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT THE MORE I REALIZE SENTINELS REALLY DOES EMULATE A RAID FIGHT INCREDIBLY WELL
MASSIVE DARKNESS ONCE IT IS OUT
MYTH

BOSS FIGHTS ALL HAVE MULTIPLE STAGES THERE IS SOME LOOTING TO BE DONE AND SOME CARRY OVER BETWEEN MISSIONS

THE 1ST PRINTING HAD A TERRIBLE RULE SET AND THERE WERE SOME REALLY BAD REVIEWS THE VERSION WHICH COMES WITH THE GAME FROM THEIR WEBSITE OR YOU CAN DOWNLOAD A PACK FOR FREE FIXES A LOT OF THE ISSUES

IT'S VERY FREE FORM THOUGH AND MISSION STRUCTURE ENEMY NUMBERS TYPES OUTSIDE OF THE MODULES PUBLISHED STORIES AVAILABLE IS UP TO THE PLAYERS

STILL CLOSEST GAME I HAVE SEEN TO WOW STYLE MECHANICS
AS A FORMER WOW ADDICT AND RAIDER THE BEST GAMES I'VE FOUND THAT CAN BRING THAT FEELING HAVE BEEN IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER

DESCENT WITH DM APP

SHADOWS OVER BRIMSTONE

GLOOMHAVEN LOOKS LIKE IT'LL BE RIGHT IN LINE

CONAN KINDA

AND I HAVEN'T PLAYED THEM BUT THE D D GAMES MAY BE IN THAT SAME VEIN
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT TO RUN D D ON HEROSCAPE TERRAIN WHICH IS PROBABLY AMAZING
I WOULD SUGGEST SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE TILES DUNGEONS LOOT AND GEAR PROGRESSION EVEN STOPS BETWEEN MISSIONS TO GO TO THE TOWN AND SELL STUFF HIGHLY CUSTOMIZABLE TOO WITH TONS OF FAN MADE EXPANSIONS AND CAMPAIGNS
SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE IT'S AS HARD AS A RAID AND NEEDS AS MUCH COORDINATION YOY DON'T GET LOOT BUT YOU DO LEVEL UP FULL COOPERATION NO DM
CHECK OUT AEONS END SHOULD BE OUT IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS SEEMS TO HAVE A WOW BOSS FIGHT FEEL
DOOMROCK
DESCENT WITH THE VALKYRIE MOD YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN SCENARIOS THAT PLAY OUT LIKE THE APPARENTLY
I GUESS DESCENT OR VAST DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS
HONESTLY THE CLOSEST I'VE COME TO THE SAME FEELING OF RAIDING IN WOW AREN'T SWORD AND SORCERY GAMES MY RECO LIST
PANDEMIC LEGACY I MEAN OF COURSE
PANDEMIC CTHULU GOOD TWIST ON PANDEMIC
FORBIDDEN DESERT LIGHT FUN ALWAYS HARD
TIME STORIES DEFINITELY CHECK THIS OUT
BCOM THE BOARD GAME STRESS
DESCENT I'VE HEARD THE APP IS PRETTY TIGHT NEVER TRIED BASE GAME IS FUN

I HAVEN'T PLAYED THESE BUT I'M HOPEFUL THESE MIGHT SCRATCH THE WOW RAIDING ITCH
KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER GOT AND YEARS TO WAIT
DARK SOULS BOARD GAME GUESS WHAT THE RULES WILL BE LIKE COOL MINIS THOUGH
TIME STORIES HAS THAT FEEL OF WORKING TOGETHER TO TAKE DOWN A BOSS WIPING AND COMING BACK WITH A NEW STRATEGY TO TRY AGAIN MY GROUP REALLY LOVES IT
MY GIRLFRIEND LOVES HARRY POTTER DOES IT ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE AN IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE
MY WIFE AND I HAVE SPLENDOR BY MARC ANDRE WHICH CAN BE PRETTY FUN AS A TWO PLAYER BUT WORKS WELL WITH OR IF COMPANY COMES OVER
DOMINION IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A CARD GAME THAT CAN WORK FAIRLY WELL WITH ONLY TWO PEOPLE GIVEN THE RIGHT CHOICE OF DECK BUT ALSO SCALES WELL IF THERE IS COMPANY I LOVE THAT DOMINION HAS MULTIPLE EXPANSIONS WHICH GIVES A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIVERSITY

WE LOVE SETTLERS AND SO WE BOUGHT THE 2 PLAYER CARD GAME VERSION CALLED RIVALS OF CATAN WHICH IS PRETTY FUN

THESE GAMES AREN'T CO-OP UNFORTUNATELY BUT MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING AT IF YOU TWO ARE IN THE MARKET FOR MORE GAMES
IF YOU LIKED THAT CHECK OUT

THE BIG BOOK OF MADNESS IT HAS A VERY SIMILAR THEME TO HARRY POTTER BUT MOST CRITICS PREFER THIS OVER HP

YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE END FOR A STEP UP IN COMPLEXITY I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

THESE ARE BOTH COOP DECK BUILDERS AS WELL
DOES THE GAME HAVE A LOT OF REPLACEABILITY
WELCOME TO THE HOBBY GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T GET TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES AS YOUR FIRST PICKUP THE GAME IS GREAT BUT NOT REALLY REPAYABLE ALSO IT IS BEST AT I HOPE YOUR ADVENTURES IN THE HOBBY GIVE YOU LOTS OF GREAT MEMORIES
I JUST THIS OVER THANKSGIVING WITH MY FAMILY WHAT GREAT GAME I FIND IT MORE INTERESTING THAN LEGENDARY DUE TO THE ARCH OF THE GAME YOU KIND OF PLAY A CAMPAIGN THROUGH ALL BOOKS BUT CAN RESET EVERYTHING IF NEEDED THE GAME STARTS EASY BUT QUICKLY BECOMES CHALLENGING THE GAMEPLAY FEELS BALANCED AND THE QUALITY OF THE COMPONENTS IS SOLID I HAVE OVER GAMES AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK GAMES I'VE GOTTEN IN A LONG TIME
CHECK OUT LEGENDARY MARVEL OR ENCOUNTERS FOR MORE CO-OP DECK BUILDERS
FYI A LOT OF COPIES ARE MISSING STUPEFY CARDS IN GAME IT'S NOT A HUGE DEAL SINCE IT'S JUST TWO CARDS OUT OF THE HOGWARTS DECK BUT IF YOU CONTACT USAOPOLY THEY'LL SEND THEM TO YOU FOR FREE
YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT THE GAME THE PACKAGING REALLY DOES PROVIDE GREAT STORAGE I USE LITTLE PLASTIC CONDIMENT CONTAINERS FOR THE DAMAGE AND COIN TOKENS

OVERALL A GAME I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
ALWAYS GREAT TO HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING INTO THE HOBBY I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU TWO LOOK FOR PATCHWORK IT'S A FANTASTIC 2 PLAYER GAME ABOUT QUILTING
HMM I AM GLAD YOU POSTED THIS I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A HARRY POTTER GAME FOR A WHILE THERE ARE LOTS OF THEMED GAMES BUT ONLY A HANDFUL OF ACTUAL UNIQUE GAMES I HADN'T EVEN HEARD THAT THIS ONE HAD BEEN RELEASED I THINK I'LL SNAG IT FOR CHRISTMAS FOR MY WIFE AND I
THIS POST MUST CONTAIN SPOILERS BUT I'VE ONLY PLAYED TWICE SO READ AT YOUR OWN RISK

OUR FIRST PLAYTHROUGH WE GOT HAUNT AND I WAS THE BETRAYER I TURNED OVER THE ITEM DISCARD PILE CARD AT A TIME BECAUSE I HAD NO ITEM WHICH SEEMED THE COMPLETELY MOST FAIR WAY TO DO IT AND I GOT THE REVOLVER I THEN SHOT KILLED THE OLD DUDE WHICH GOT ME A KILL RIGHT AWAY BUT THE TILE I NEEDED WAS NOT REVEALED I EXPLORED LIKE MORE TILE AND GOT THE ONE I NEEDED BUT THE SURVIVORS KEPT PUTTING THEIR OBJECTIVE ON ME AS I WENT TO GET THE OLD DUDE I BARELY GOT HIM TO WHERE HE NEEDED TO GO AND ROLLED WHAT I NEEDED ON THE ONLY TURN I HAD LEFT AND WON AS THE BETRAYER AND WE STILL TALK ABOUT IT A WEEK LATER

TONIGHT MY WIFE WAS THE BETRAYER SHE FAILED THE HAUNT ROLL WITH ONLY CARDS OUT WHICH WAS LAUGHABLE BUT WE ROLLED WITH IT HA HA I THINK WE GOT OR WHATEVER FOR THE MADMAN WITH A BOOK IN THE FURNACE AND WE SOMEHOW DREW THE PICKPOCKET RIGHT AWAY AND WERE ABLE TO GET HER BOOK AND THEN GO BURN IT AFTER LIKE OR 2 ROUNDS SO THE SURVIVORS WON IT SEEMS LIKE EACH HAUNT IS UNFAIRLY LEVELED IN WAY OR THE OTHER SO WHEN YOU TRIGGER THE HAUNT EITHER GTO OF THAT FLOOR OR STAY THERE IF YOU CAN WIN LOL

I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SWEET GAME THE WAY THEY HAVE SO MANY HAUNTS BUT I AGREE YOU FIND CERTAIN MECHANICS OR RULES THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE AND IT KIND OF BREAKS THE GAME AND THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO HOUSE RULE THINGS AND HOPE ITS FAIR
MY PARTNER AND I WERE REALLY EXCITED TO INTRODUCE THAT GAME TO SOME FRIENDS AND WE WERE REALLY TALKING UP THE BETRAYER MECHANIC WE GOT THE TREASURE HUNT HAUNT IN WHICH THERE WAS NO BETRAYER IT WAS SO DISAPPOINTING THAT WE GOT LIKE THE ONE SCENARIO THAT DID NOT HAVE A TRAITOR
I REALLY DON'T LIKE SMALL CHANGE I WANT TO SAY EITHER HAUNT OR I'D JUST RECOMMEND SKIPPING THAT ONE
IS RIDICULOUSLY POORLY BALANCED TRAITOR WINS BEFORE THE HEROES HAVE A CHANCE TO DO ANYTHING
HAUNT WAS NOT A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR MY GROUP WE FOUND THAT THE ASTRAL SPIRITS WERE WAY TOO POWERFUL AND THE HEROES COULDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING IT ALSO DIDN'T HELP THAT IT WAS OUR FIRST TIME PLAYING THE GAME
WAS THE ONE WITH WOLVES AND BARRICADES AND SHIT THAT WAS WRITTEN BY THE GUY THAT MADE THE ZOMBIE BOARD GAME CANT REMEMBER THE TITLE DEAD SOMETHING AND HE BASICALLY PLASTERED HIS RULES OVER BETRAYALS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS FUCKING STUPID IF I WANTED TO PLAY YOUR FUCKING GAME I WOULD HAVE PICKED IT INSTEAD

TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THAT ONE DESCRIBED ABOVE AND ALSO PLASTIC FANTASTIC WAY TOO MANY MONSTERS TO KEEP TRACK OF
I PLAY GAMES WITH MY Y O SOMETIMES BUT THAT DUMBSHIT SUCKS AT TWILIGHT STRUGGLE I WIN LIKE ALMOST HALF THE TIME
REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING CANDYLAND PICK 2 CARDS AND LET THEM CHOOSE IT MAKES THE GAME GO FASTER AND THEY LEARN BASIC STRATEGY
I PLAY KING OF TOKYO WITH MY WE JUST REMOVE THE CARDS FROM THE GAME AND WE MADE A RULE THAT POWER CUBES EQUAL A POINT
YAY

WE'RE WORKING ON FIRST ORCHARD GOT ABOUT THE SKILLS DOWN
HURRAH I HAVE A THREE MONTH OLD AND AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY WHERE SHE CAN PLAY GAMES
MY SON IS AND I'VE PLAYED A FEW HABA GAMES WITH HIM LIKE ANIMAL UPON ANIMAL EVENING AT THE STABLE AND ORCHARD FIRST ORCHARD HE LOVES PLAYING WITH THE BITS AND EVEN DOESN'T MIND ROLLING THE DICE SOMETIMES BUT HE STILL DOESN'T GET THAT THERE ARE RULES AND CONDITIONS ON HOW THIS IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN

WE HAD HIM AT A GAMES CAFE A LITTLE WHILE AGO TO FULFILL A MATH TRADE AND SAT DOWN TO PLAY ORCHARD AMIDST ALL THE OTHER GAMERS PLAYING EMET OR DOMINANT SPECIES OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND HE WAS MUCH MORE ATTUNED TO THE EXPERIENCE

HE ALSO LOVES PLAYING WITH ALL THE BITS AND PIECES THAT COME WITH DAD'S GAMES AND I GENERALLY LET HIM SO LONG AS THEY AREN'T CARDS OR SOMETHING ELSE THAT COULD BE EASILY DAMAGED HE'S BUILDING A GOOD APPRECIATION OF GAMES AS A RESULT I THINK
MY THREE YEAR OLD REALLY LIKES PITCH CAR
I'VE JUST BOUGHT RHINO HERO FOR MY WIFE FOR CHRISTMAS AND I'M HOPING OUR FOUR-YEAR-OLD WILL WANT TO PLAY TOO
SAVING FOR LATER THANKS FOR THIS POST JUST BOUGHT A BUNCH OF HABA GAMES FOR MY YR OLD SON I WAS LOOKING AT PITCH CAR BUT IT'S A LITTLE PRICEY ON AMAZON I BOUGHT MONZA SO WE WILL SEE IF THAT'S TOO ADVANCED OR NOT THANKS AGAIN
WHAT'S A MIMI
THE TALES AND GAMES SERIES IS GREAT TOO
WE PLAY HAPPY SALMON WITH MY YO AND HE LOVES IT
MY SOS NIECES AND NEPHEWS ARE ALL ABOUT THE OLDEST OF WHICH IS TURNING FOUR SOON I AM SO EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO START PLAYING GAMES WITH THEM IT WILL BE ANY DAY NOW
MY 2 YEAR OLD ENJOYS THE GOODNIGHT MOON MATCHING GAME WHAT'S COOL IS THAT IT COMES WITH MULTIPLE RULE SETS THAT GET PROGRESSIVELY MORE AS SHE MATURES AND CAN HANDLE THEM
HOW LONG UNTIL FIRST TWILIGHT IMPERIUM GAME
I TOO HAVE PLAYED A GAME WITH MY UNBORN FETUS
THE NEW HARRY POTTER GAME HAS SCREENS FROM THE FILMS RATHER THAN ORIGINAL ARTWORK AND TO BE HONEST THAT HAS TURNED ME OFF FROM THE GAME IF I PLAYED IT AND FOUND IT TO BE GOOD I'D PROBABLY GET IT BUT THE ARTWORK HAS KEPT FROM TAKING A CHANCE ON IT WHEN THERE ARE OTHER GAMES THAT INTEREST ME MORE
I RECENTLY BOUGHT CASTLES OF BURGUNDY DAMN THAT'S AN UGLY BOX IT LOOKS LIKE A JIGSAW PUZZLE YOUR GRANDMA HAS HAD SINCE
I WOULD LOVE TO LOVE POWER GRID BUT I JUST FIND THE THEME SO DULL IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THE MECHANICS
I PASSED ON CARCASSONNE IN STORES QUITE A FEW TIMES BECAUSE THE BOX ART IS SO PRETTY BAD INSIDE IS A DIFFERENT STORY
LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS FIREFLY EVERY CARD I'VE SEEN LOOKS HIDEOUS AND IS WHAT IS PREVENTING ME FROM GETTING IT
SANTORINITE WHY OH WHY DID THE LOXLEY EDITION HAVE TO USE ARTWORK OF BABY GREEK GODS

DOESN'T KEEP ME FROM PLAYING MY DIY VERSION THOUGH
GLORY TO ROME I'VE HEARD SO MANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT BUT THE ARTWORK IS WORSE THAN MUNCHKIN I GUESS I'M NOT INTO ARTWORK IN BOARDGAMES ESPECIALLY IF THE GAME ITSELF ISN'T CARTOON IN THEME
PUERTO RICO IS AMONG MY VERY FIRST PURCHASES AND STILL SITS UNPLAYED I HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER THAT IT IS A GREAT GAME BUT EVERY TIME I OPEN THE BOX I AM JUST SO UNDERWHELMED THAT I CAN NOT BRING MYSELF TO TRY IT OUT
SHOGUN PART OF THE REASON I DIDN'T PICK IT UP IS BECAUSE IT'S RATHER UGLY
DOMINION I HAVENT GOTTEN AROUND TO TRYING IT BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE ALWAYS CATCHES MY EYE
SPACE EMPIRES I LOVE S AND WE ACTUALLY GET THEM TO THE TABLE EVERY SO OFTEN I'VE HEARD THIS ONE IS THE OG AND REALLY SOLID BUT MAN I CAN'T GET OVER HOW UGLY AND BORING IT LOOKS
NO GAME IN PARTICULAR BUT IT DOES BUG ME WHEN THEY RECYCLE ART ASSETS I MEAN I GET IT IF YOU'RE GONNA SPEND HOWEVER MUCH ON THE RIGHTS TO AN ART IT MAKES SENSE TO WRING AS MUCH OUT OF IT AS POSSIBLE BUT IT'S JUST KINDA JARRING WHEN YOU KNOW PLASCRETE ART BY HEART AND THEN SOMEBODY WRITES BOWIE KNIFE OVER IT IN SHARPIE

RELATEDLY WHEN GAMES HAVE MECHANICALLY DISTINCT CARDS WITH THE SAME ART AGAIN I GET THAT ART COSTS MONEY AND GAMES HAVE BUDGETS BUT SETTING ASIDE AESTHETICS THE ONLY MECHANICAL PURPOSE OF THE ART IS TO ALLOW YOU TO EASILY IDENTIFY CARDS AT A GLANCE WITHOUT HAVING TO KEEP CHECKING THE TITLE OR PICKING UP THE CARD TO SEE WHICH VAGUELY ARCANE SYMBOLS THEY PLACED ON THE LAYER ABOVE THE GENERIC TOME BACKGROUND
I'VE PASSED OVER GUILDHALL MANY TIMES AT MY FAGS BECAUSE THE BOX AND CARD ART IS SO BAD I JUST HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY SOMEONE COPY AT MY GAMING GROUP AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THERE IS A TIGHT LITTLE HAND MANAGEMENT SET COLLECTION GAME IN THAT UGLY ASS BOX
HIVE BECAUSE I CAN'T DEAL WITH INSECTS THE VISCERAL REACTION IS REALLY AWFUL EVEN AROUND ABSTRACTIONS OF BUGS LIKE THE TILES ARE OTHERWISE LOOKS LIKE A GREAT GAME
I WILL NEVER NOT LOVE ASCENSION BUT I REALLY DON'T LIKE ANY OF THE ART THAT ISN'T THE DREAMSCAPE EXPANSION
KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER HAS FANTASTICALLY DETAILED MINIS AND THE ART PRODUCTION VALUES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF BUT IS A HUGE FOR ME STYLISTICALLY

GIANT CRAWLING AND LION CREATURES WITH ENORMOUS TENTACLE DONGS THAT'S A GIANT BOX OF NOPE

IT'S A REAL SHAME THAT I CAN'T GET PAST THE THEME AS THE GAME SOUNDS AMAZING



I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT GOS LOOKS LIKE A NEAT GAME MECHANICALLY BUT THE GOBLIN ARTWORK ON THE CARDS WHILE VERY WELL DONE JUST KIND OF TURNS ME OFF AND WOULD CERTAINLY MY WIFE WHO IS MY MAIN GAMING PARTNER

ADDITIONALLY LA GANJA LOOKS LIKE A GREAT GAME BUT THE THEME OF FARMING IS NOT EPIC IN SCOPE ENOUGH FOR MY TASTES TAKE THE SAME GAME AND MAKE IT ABOUT BUILDING A CITY OR A SPACE STATION OR MANAGING THE TRADES OF AN ENTIRE COUNTRY AND I ENJOY IT MORE I FIND GAMES THAT ARE TOO NARROW OR SMALL IN SCOPE DON'T INSPIRE ME AS MUCH
I'M INTERESTED IN ORLEANS BUT THE COLOURS AND ARTWORK ARE STOPPING ME FROM BUYING IT
I'M BREAKING YOUR RULE SINCE I'VE ALREADY TRIED AGENTS OF SMEARS AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT BUT THAT WHOLE CHEAP CGI ART STYLE THAT YOU WOULD SEE ON A FLASH GAMES WEBSITE REALLY MAKES IT HARD TO WANT TO TAKE IT OUT AND PLAY IT
GREAT WESTERN TRAIL
TOTALLY A MINORITY HERE BUT AVALON THE ART IS AMAZING BUT I'VE JUST SEEN TOO MUCH MEDIEVAL OR SUPER SCI-FI STUFF IF THERE COULD BE A OR SUPER MINIMALISTIC ART OR OR OR OR FEUDING JAPANESE WARLORDS OR OR MEAN GIRLS OR GAME OF THRONES OR OLD CRONES VS YOUNG WHIPPERSNAPPERS OR ZOMBIES VS SURVIVORS OR OR OR OR ROMAN ARMY OR NOIR THEME VERSION
I REALLY LIKE BIBLIOG BUT IT RARELY HITS THE TABLE FOR HIS DULL THEME AND REALLY UNEXCITING ARTWORK
ROADS BOATS ONLY GAME I EVER SOLD BECAUSE IT WAS TOO UGLY
FOR ME IT WOULD BE DEAD OF WINTER I DON'T CARE A LICK ABOUT ZOMBIES HAVE NEVER HAD ANY INTEREST IN THIS GAME BUT RELUCTANTLY PLAYED RECENTLY AT A NEETUP IT IS ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD GAME BUT I STILL DIDN'T ENJOY IT AT ALL BECAUSE THE THEME WAS SUCH A TURNOFF

ANY OTHER THEME AND I WOULD BE ALL ABOUT THIS GAME
NO ONE'S MENTIONED LEGENDARY FIREFLY NO ONE
NATIONS IT'S A PRETTY GOOD GAME BUT THE ARTWORK SUCKS BALLS I FIND IT A BIT FRUSTRATING THAT THROUGH THE AGES GOT AN ART UPGRADE BUT NATIONS WON'T
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE DON'T LIKE THE ART GRAPHICS
ANIS HATE THE MAP TILES
FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE LOOKS LIKE A PROTOTYPE
VAST THE CRYSTAL CAVERN LOOKS LIKE A PROTOTYPE
I'D LOVE A CONCORDIA THEME VERSION
CAELUS THE GAME IS GREAT BUT THE ART IS SO BAD THAT I CANT FORCE MYSELF TO GET IT EVEN THE DELUXE EDITION LOOKS BLAND AND UGLY THANKS TO THE SIMILAR ART
NUNS ON THE RUN NEEDS A BOARDING SCHOOL RETHEME AND NOT TO USE STANDEES FOR THE PATROLS I'D RATHER HAVE SOME SORT OF MINI OR TOKEN OVER A STANDEE

IN FACT I HATE STANDEES MORE THAN I HATE BOAR MINIS KICKSTARTERS
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE HANDS DOWN THE VISUAL APPEAL COMPARES EASILY TO THE TASTE OF SALTINE CRACKERS FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IN PICTURES FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE IS IN THE SAME BOAT MECHANICALLY I'M SURE THEY'RE AMAZING GAMES BUT BOTH GAMES REALLY SHOULD BE SOLD IN A BROWN PAPER BAG
FLASHPOINT THE ARTWORK OF THE GAME MAKES IT FEEL LIKE A LITTLE KIDS GAME I THINK I MORE REALISTIC VERSION OF A BURNING BUILDING AND STUFF WOULD BE MORE APPEALING TO OLDER GAMERS
MEMOIR FOR ME THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT SHOOTING SOLDIERS TO BITS THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO IMAGINE ENJOYING THIS GAME BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT IS A FANTASTIC GAME BUT I JUST CAN'T IGNORE THE THEME
PATCHWORK I'M INTRIGUED BY THE TETRISY ASPECTS OF IT BUT HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN THE THEME IN FACT I'M EMBARRASSED TO BUY IT
DELETED
I BOUGHT A SIMILAR LISTING OFF RECENTLY AND YES I WOULD IMAGINE YOU ARE GETTING A SIMILAR GLORIFIED PRINT AND PLAY VERSION DEFINITELY NOT THE QUALITY OF WHAT KS BACKERS ARE GETTING WITH THAT SAID MINE WAS AND WE HAD AN ABSOLUTE BLAST PLAYING IT TILL IN THE MORNING TODAY FROM STARTING ABOUT LAST NIGHT

ALL THE GROUP WOULD BE CONSIDERED NON BOARD GAMERS OK BESIDE ME MAYBE BUT ONCE WE GOT INTO THE FLOW OF THINGS THE GAME REALLY PICKED UP AND A BLAST WAS HAD BY ALL TWO PEOPLE OF THE GROUP SAID THAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT WHEN I WAS EXPLAINING THE GAME AND WERE READY TO GIVE UP AND GO BACK TO JUST DRINKING GAMES BUT THAT BY THE 3RD GAME THEY WERE HOOKED WE HAD SOME TERRIBLE GAMES IN THE BEGINNING WHERE LIBERALS WERE TRYING TO BE DECEITFUL JUST BECAUSE THEY SAW THE FASCISTS DOING SO THAT RESULTED IN SOME EASY ELIMINATIONS I ALSO WAS THE FIRST PERSON INSPECTED A MAJORITY OF THE TIME BECAUSE DESPITE IT BEING MY FIRST TIME TO PLAY THE GAME AS WELL THEY FELT I HAD SOME SORT OF SUPER SECRET HITLER ABILITY THAT THEY COULDN'T OVERCOME WHEN I WAS A FASCIST IN THESE CASES BEING EXAMINED BY A LIBERAL I COULDN'T REFUTE THE REVELATION BECAUSE NO ONE WAS THINKING ABOUT STRATEGY ENOUGH TO DISAGREE WITH CHECKER AND IT LOOKED BAD IF I LAID INTO THE NEW PLAYERS BUT ALL WAS WELL AND MY GROUP LOVED IT PROBABLY GOING TO BUY ONUS OR CODENAMES NEXT TO SUPPLEMENT AFTER ALL THE FASCISM DIES DOWN

OP NEEDS EITHER A PROPHET OR A REALLY GOOD FORTUNE COOKIE FOR THIS ONE
I'M PRETTY SURE THE BOX OF THE REAL VERSION LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT ALMOST DEFINITELY A VERSION
THE BOX AND CARDS LOOK TOTALLY DIFFERENT ON THE REAL VERSION BUT IF I BOUGHT IT AND GOT EXACTLY WHAT THE PICTURES SHOWED I WOULDN'T BE TOO MAD IT LOOKS LIKE A REALLY GLORIFIED PRINT AND PLAY
IF THE IMAGE MATCHES ANY ONE OF THESE IT'S PROBABLY NOT AN ORIGINAL PRODUCTION AND YOUR QUALITY MIGHT VARY
SINCE I DIDN'T SEE IT IN THE COMMENTS YET GET WELL SOON MENTAL HEALTH IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE HELP YOU NEED
EXPLODING KITTENS

SMASH UP

BOSS MONSTER

SUSHI GO

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM

FORBIDDEN ISLAND

FLASH POINT MAYBE

BTW GET BETTER I'M GLAD YOU'RE GETTING HELP WHEN THERE IS SUCH A TERRIBLE STIGMA ON MENTAL HEALTH I DON'T KNOW YOU AND I FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT BUT I'M ALREADY PROUD OF YOU
DIXIT
WHEN I WAS IN THE PSYCH WARD WE USED TO ENJOY PLAYING APPLES TO APPLES WHILE WE WAITING FOR OUR NIGHTLY SLEEPING PILLS TO KICK IN IT WAS A HOOT
DOUBLE CHECK WITH THE NURSING STAFF FIRST AS THERE MAY BE CERTAIN ITEMS THEY WON'T WANT BROUGHT IN

SMALL PIECES COULD BE CHOKED ON THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN YOUR SHOE LACES AND BELTS FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION AND IF YOU HAVE ELECTRONICS THEY WON'T LET YOU KEEP THE CHARGER DUE TO FEARS OF BOTH YOURS AND OTHER PATIENTS

CARDS THAT COULD BE ABSENTMINDEDLY STOLEN DESTROYED HOW MANY GAMES DO WE ALL HAVE IN OUR COLLECTIONS THAT CAN'T BE PLAYED CORRECTLY BECAUSE WE'RE MISSING A PIECE

ARGUMENTS CONFLICTS THAT COULD ARISE FROM COMPETITIVE GAMES SOME PEOPLE WILL BE MORE ACCEPTING THAN OTHERS AND HEAVY CARD STOCK THAT COULD BE USED IN THEORY AS A WEAPON

GOOD LUCK IN THERE BUD I WAS PERSONALLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I DID A STAY AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PING PONG TABLE HOPE YOU HAVE QUIETER NIGHTS THAN I HAD
DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFICS BUT MAYBE HETP WILL HELP THEY DO ACCESSIBILITY STUFF INCLUDING EMOTIONAL COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL ANALYSIS
YOU BROUGHT CARDS TO THE PSYCH WARD BECAUSE YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT NOT PLAYING WITH A FULL DECK
WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING PEOPLE'S STAY BETTER THAT'S REALLY KIND AND GENEROUS OF YOU MY SUGGESTIONS APPLES TO APPLES ALLOWS A LOT OF PEOPLE TO PLAY AND IF A FEW CARDS GO MISSING IT WON'T AFFECT GAMEPLAY ALSO WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT ASSOCIATIONS PEOPLE MAKE CONNECT MANCALA BACKGAMMON ARE TWO PLAYER GAMES WITH HIGH REPLAY VALUE THAT CAN BE PLAYED WITH BUTTONS OR COINS IF NECESSARY DICE GAMES MIGHT ALSO BE GOOD ZOMBIE DICE YAHTZEE DUNGEON ROLL ETC ALTHOUGH MORE PRONE TO HAVE PIECES GETTING LOST
MY RECOMMENDATION IS SOMETHING FROM THE ONIUM UNIVERSE I EAST ONIUM CASTELLON SYLVIAN I'M SURE I'VE SPELLED THESE WRONG BUT I'M WRITING ON MY PHONE AND TOO LAZY TO CHECK ALL THREE HAVE A VERY SMALL FOOTPRINT AND CAN BE PLAYED SINGLE PLAYER OR WITH TWO I BELIEVE SHOULD BE FAIRLY EASY TO LEARN AND TEACH AS WELL
I'LL SECOND LOVE LETTER AND FLUX LOONACY IS ANOTHER GOOD ONE ALONG THE SAME LINES

YOU WANT THE MOST GATEWAY OF GATEWAY GAMES SO SUSHI GO MIGHT BE A LOSER

YOU ALSO WORRY ABOUT LOSING PIECES SO TICKET TO RIDE CARCASSONNE AND PANDEMIC MIGHT ALSO BE NOT GREAT

YOU DON'T WANT TO START FIGHTS OR THE STAFF DON'T WANT FIGHTS TO START AT LEAST SO I'D PASS ON CATAN MUNCHKIN AND HANAFI

I WOULD PROBABLY MOSTLY STICK WITH CARD GAMES

I'D SAY IT'S DIFFERENT WHAT WILL WORK WITH YOU THERE VS WHAT WILL WORK AFTER YOU'RE GONE YOU CAN SURELY TEACH SUSHI GO AND YOU WOULD MAKE SURE PANDEMIC IS PUT AWAY WHOLE

HOW ABOUT LOVE LETTER OR SUSHI GO
I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THIS SOMEONE CLOSE TO ME WOULD HAVE ENJOYED YOUR COMPANY IN THERE I WISH YOU WELL

I'LL TRY TO THINK OF SOMETHING APPROPRIATE TO ADD FOR NOW JUST SENDING GOOD VIBES

EDIT CODENAMES VERY EASY RULES AND SETUP NOT BROKEN IF A FEW CARDS ARE LOST
I HAVEN'T PLAYED HOKKAIDO YET BUT FROM WHAT I'VE READ IT'S A VERY CALMING GAME THAT'S NOT VERY COMPETITIVE
WITHOUT GOING INTO SPECIFICS I'VE BEEN IN YOUR SITUATION

FIRST CHECK WITH YOUR NURSES FOR LIMITS THERE MIGHT BE LIMITS ON THE CONTAINER PIECES YOU CAN HAVE I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH I COULDN'T BRING CARCASSONNE BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT TILE EDGES COULD BE SHARPENED AND USED AS CUTTING IMPLEMENTS AND OR THE TILES COULD BE TORN APART AND USED TO CHOKE YOURSELF IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU'RE AT SO ASKING IS THE BEST POLICY

SECOND YOU NEED TO KEEP CONTENT IN MIND I'M SEEING SOME PEOPLE RECOMMEND FLASH POINT LOVE LETTER EXPLODING KITTENS ET CETERA MY BLANKET RULE WOULD BE TO STICK TO EITHER CUTE GAMES OR HISTORICAL GAMES DURING MY STAY I HAD FELLOW PATIENTS IN THERE FOR EVERYTHING FROM BAD RELATIONSHIP BREAKUPS TO PETS DYING TO NOT QUITE BEING ABLE TO GOING DIRECTLY THERE AFTER SOME TRAGEDY THAT KILLED EVERYONE ELSE IN THEIR FAMILY BUT THEM YOU LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE THING IS GONNA BE THAT LANDED SOMEONE IN THE SEAT BESIDE YOU THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO IS PULL OUT KITTENS IN A BLENDER BEFORE I FOUND OUT ONE OF THE WOMEN DURING MY STAY HAD A PSYCHOTIC BREAK AFTER HER CAT DIED BECAUSE HER HUSBAND HAD DIED YEARS BEFORE AND IT WAS THE LAST LINK SHE HAD REMAINING TO HIM SO MANY OF THE THINGS WE TAKE FOR GRANTED AS THEMES ARE THE THINGS THAT BROKE SOMEONES ENTIRE WORLD I CAN'T GUARANTEE YOU WON'T HIT ROCKY SPOTS WITH TRIVIA GAMES IF SOMEONE IS REALLY BUMMED ABOUT WHICH YEAR NIXON STEPPED DOWN BUT ENTIRE GAMES THEMED AROUND HOUSES BEING ON FIRE RELATIONSHIPS ANY SORT OF ANIMAL ABUSE EVEN THE CUTE ONES I REALLY ENJOY LIKE EXPLODING KITTENS OR THINGS OF THAT NATURE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST BE AVOIDED I'D EVEN BE WARY OF ABSTRACT GAMES WITH A THEME LIKE TRURO OF THE SEAS JUST IN CASE

THOSE THINGS BEING SAID THE TWO GAMES THAT REALLY GOT ME THROUGH IT WERE SUSHI GO AND TIMELINE BOTH OF WHICH I LEFT THERE WHEN I LEFT AFTER TEACHING THE STAFF TO PLAY

SUSHI GO IS A SIMPLE ENOUGH CARD GAME AND I FELT LIKE THE STABLER PATIENTS WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT ON TOP OF WHICH IT'S CHEAP ENOUGH THAT EVEN IF COMPLETELY RUINED IT'S NOT A TON TO REPLACE

THE VARIOUS TIMELINE GAMES WERE FANTASTIC SIMPLE ENOUGH FOR JUST ABOUT ANYONE TO PLAY AND BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON REAL WORLD EVENTS IT HAS THE TRIVIA ELEMENT TO DRAW PEOPLE IN MY FAVORITE ASPECT OF IT THOUGH IS THAT EVERY CARD IS DISPOSABLE IF SOMEONE WRECKS A SINGLE CARD OH WELL THAT CARD JUST ISN'T AVAILABLE ANYMORE BUT EVERY CARD IS LITERALLY AN EVENT NAME ON ONE SIDE AND THE EVENT NAME AND YEAR ON THE OTHER AND ENOUGH EXPANSIONS AND CATEGORIES FOR JUST ABOUT ANYONE TO ENJOY
LANTERNS IS ONE OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES VERY SIMPLE AND PRETTY ALSO DIXIT WOULD BE A GOOD ONE IN THIS SITUATION DOESN'T LOSE ANYTHING FROM A FEW MISSING CARDS
LOTUS
MAYBE MACHI BORO IT'S EASY TO LEARN AND IT WOULDN'T RUIN THE GAME IF A FEW CARDS GO MISSING AS LONG AS THEY WEREN'T THE STARTER CARDS I SUPPOSE
PATCHWORK WOULD BE A GREAT CHOICE
JENA

QWIRKLE IS A GOOD CHOICE TOO

ZOMBIE DICE
CARD GAMES ARE IDEAL GAMES LIKE SUSHI GO AND DEAD MAN'S DRAW
OKAY SO FIRST OFF THE BRINGING A FULL DECK THING BROUGHT A SMILE AND A LAUGH TO ME THANK YOU SO MUCH

I'D ERR TOWARDS SIMPLE CO-OP GAMES SO STUFF LIKE PANDEMIC WOULD STRIKE ME AS A GOOD CALL

I KNOW MY LITTLE BROTHER WAS IN A WARD FOR A WHILE AND THEY WERE ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE ZOMBICIDE PHASE AND FIVE CROWNS

ALSO SNACKS SNACKS ARE IMPORTANT
I SEE YOU ALREADY HAVE IT BUT JUST CAME TO SAY THAT STAR REALMS GOT ME THROUGH A SIMILAR STAY RECENTLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE PICK UP THE GAMBIT EXPANSION FOR YOU THE SOLO AND CO-OP MODES INCLUDED IN THAT SET CAN MAKE IT BETTER WHEN NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY OR NO ONE WANTS TO LOSE
I'VE GOT A BUDDY DOING A TWO MONTH HITCH IN A FACILITY FOR PTSD I SENT HIM WITH MY COPY OF SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL I FIGURED IT WAS A VERY LOW-PROFILE GAME BUT STILL DEEP AND COMPLEX AS WELL AS BEING THE EXPANSIONS ARE GETTING TOUGH TO COME BY BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THE CORE GAME ONLINE STILL
KITTENS IN A BLENDER AND POO ARE SUPER SIMPLE AND RELY ONLY ON CARDS YOU NEED MARKERS FOR POO BUT THEY CAN BE ANYTHING SCRAPS OF PAPER COINS CANDY CARCASSONNE WOULD ALSO BE GOOD ECHOING EVERYONE ELSE APPLES TO APPLES WOULD BE LOTS OF FUN AND IF CARDS ARE LOST OR DAMAGED THERE'S NO HARM TO OVERALL GAMEPLAY
CONCEPT IS MOSTLY COOPERATIVE GUESSING GAME WITH SIMPLE RULES THE CARDS HAVE EASIER AND HARDER QUESTIONS AND YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH TO DO YOU ALSO ALWAYS HAVE A TEAMMATE WHO CAN HELP SO THE IS NO PRESSURE ON YOU AND IT IS GREAT FUN

CODENAMES IS ALSO GREAT BUT A BIT MORE STRESSFUL AND DEMANDING FOR THE TWO CAPTAIN AND IT NEEDS PLAYERS TO BE FUN

GET WELL
SINGLE PLAYER I'D NORMALLY SUGGEST HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR OR KNIERIM MAYBE EVEN THE NEW MARKHAM HORROR CG BUT THOSE WOULD LIKELY BE FROWNED ON GIVEN WHERE YOU ARE

FOR MORE PLAYERS IT DEPENDS

THE LORD OF THE RING CG COULD WORK BUT HAS A LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY THAT MIGHT RULE IT OUT

HIVE SPECIFICALLY THE POCKET EDITION COULD WORK BUT SOME PEOPLE DISLIKE BUGS

SOMETHING LIKE LOTUS KODAMA OR ARBORETUM PERHAPS A PLEASANT MEDITATIVE THEME




NIA LOVE LETTER CODENAMES GET WELL SOON
THE FOLLOWING ARE ALL SHORT GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH MY FRIENDS AND THAT I COULD SEE GO OVER WELL WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT SOMETHING LIGHT AS THEY WORK THROUGH AN ILLNESS

NO THANKS
LOST CITIES 2 PLAYER
HANAFI
QWIXX
FOR SALE
DIXIT
CONCEPT
SPLENDOR
WIZARD

SLIGHTLY MORE CHINKY 2 PLAYER GAMES
QUARTO
ONITAMA

I HOPE YOUR RECOVERY GOES WELL


SUSHI GO
I WOULD RECOMMEND HIVE
IT'S AFFORDABLE NEAR INDESTRUCTIBLE AND THE GAMEPLAY IS QUICK BUT JUST LIKE CHESS THE DEPTH OF STRATEGY IS ENTIRELY UP TO THOSE PLAYING

ALSO IF YOU GET A GOOD AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING YOU COULD EASILY PLAY SKULL WITH THAT DECK OF CARDS JUST MAKE THE SPADES YOUR SKULLS AND ALL OTHER SUITS CAN BE THE FLOWERS

GET BETTER SOON FRIEND I KNOW THOSE PLACES AREN'T THE BEST BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE MAKING THE BEST OF IT WHICH IS IMPORTANT
LANTERNS QWIRKLE BONANZA HEY THAT'S MY FISH
CARCASSONNE
DIXIT IS SOOTHING
MEDIEVAL ACADEMY IT'S A DRAFTING GAME WITH A MEDIEVAL THEME THAT HITS A NICE LEVEL OF COMPLEX WITHOUT FEELING TOO AGONIZING ON THE DECISIONS

BETWEEN TWO CITIES SEMI COOPERATIVE DRAFTING TILE LAYING GAME WHERE EACH PERSON MAKES TWO CITIES WITH EACH OF THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THE PERSON WHO HAS THE BEST SCORE OF THEIR WORST CITY WINS

DEEP SEA ADVENTURE I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE THEME FOR YOUR SITUATION IT'S A LITTLE PUSH YOUR LUCK GAME WHERE YOU ARE DIVING OFF A SUB TO COLLECT TREASURE AND GO BACK TO THE SURFACE BUT EVERYONE IS SHARING THE SAME AIR SUPPLY SO IF ANYONE GETS GREEDY YOU MAY ALL DROWN CAMEL UP IS ANOTHER SIMILAR SUGGESTION ABOUT BETTING ON CAMEL RACES

FOR SALE OR NO THANKS FOR A SIMPLE CARD GAME THAT CAN BE ADDICTING AND IS GREAT FOR NEWIES
FRIDAY AND KNIERIM PLENTY OF VARIETY THERE FOR A LONG TIME GET WELL
STAR REALMS THERE IS A SOLO MODE WITH A BOOSTER IF YOU WANT TO BE AUTONOMOUS

LOVE LETTER

VINTAGE GAMES CHECK LIST IF THAT'S AN OPTION IN YOUR AREA

CHECK LOCAL SWAP MEET GROUPS ON FACEBOOK

EDIT ADDING MORE

FLUX MAY ALSO BE AN OPTION BUT IT MAY NOT BE YOUR JAM

COUP

SUSHI GO

THESE SUGGESTIONS MIGHT GET KIND OF PRICEY BUT I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON THE LENGTH OF YOUR STAY AND BUDGET MINDEDNESS AND THEY ARE ALSO ALL COOP FORBIDDEN ISLAND PANDEMIC FORBIDDEN DESERT

JUST ABOUT ANY TRAVEL VERSIONS OF GAMES WOULD PROBABLY BE GOOD FOR EXAMPLE CATAN HAS A VERSION

EDIT EDIT HOPE YOU GET TO FEELING BETTER SOON I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT IT IS NOT VERY FUN IN THERE THOUGH IT MAY BE NECESSARY STAY STRONG
NUNS ON THE RUN MODIFY IT TO LOONIES ON THE RUN THEY'LL LOVE IT
HUH I WAS IN A PSYCH WARD AFTER ATTEMPTING SUICIDE WE FOCUSED ON GETTING BETTER NOT ON FUN AND GAMES

GET WELL SOON

EDIT WE ALSO HAD ZERO ACCESS TO COMPUTERS OR PHONES
IF YOU LIKE CONCORDIA YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY INVESTIGATE SOME OTHER MAC GAMES PARTICULARLY NAVEGADOR AND HAMBURGUM IF YOUR GROUP CAN SUPPORT IT I'VE ALSO HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT IMPERIAL THOUGH I HAVE YET TO PLAY IT MYSELF
LEWIS AND CLARK USES THE SAME YOUR CARDS ARE YOUR ACTIONS AND YOU CAN GET MORE CARDS MECHANISM ALSO ROCOCO FOR THE SAME REASON
I THINK MOMBASA MIGHT BE OF ENJOYMENT OR TRAJAN
I LOVE GAMES THAT HAVE A HAND OF CARDS FOR CHOOSING ACTIONS SOME OF MY FAVORITES ARE LEWIS CLARK GLASS ROAD ROKOKO AND BROOM SERVICE
I THINK ROKOKO MIGHT BE SOMETHING FOR YOU IT HAVE A SIMILAR DECK BUILDING MECHANIC WITH THE ADDED DEPTH THAT YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE CARDS THAT YOU THEN CAN USE IN A GIVEN TURN I REALLY ENJOY SINCE YOU THEN REALLY HAVE TO PLAN YOUR TURN AHEAD AND IT OFFERS GREAT DILEMMAS SINCE YOU PROPERLY WANT TO DO MORE STUFF THAN YOU ACTUALLY CAN DEFIANTLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES
REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN WITH SIMILAR WHAT DO YOU LIKE THE CARDS MECHANISM THE WAY IT SCORES YOU STUFF OR THE ENGINE BUILDER MAP STUFF

MOST OF MAC GERDTS GAMES HAVE THIS SORT OF MECHANISM WHERE YOU CAN'T SELECT THE SAME ACTIONS AGAINST AND HAVE SOME SORT OF CYCLICAL THING THE RONDEL IN GAMES LIKE IMPERIAL AND I BELIEVE ANTIAE PLAYS OUT A BIT THE SAME THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER GAMES WHICH USE A SIMILAR CARD MECHANISM LIKE ROCOCO OR MOMBASA

IF YOU PREFER THE ECONOMIC BUILD THE MAP THING WITHOUT MUCH CONFLICT THOUGH YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT TERRA MYSTIC OR SCYTHE

OVERALL I THINK MOMBASA COMES CLOSEST FROM A GAME BY ANOTHER DESIGNER OTHERWISE JUST SOME OF HIS MANY OTHER GAMES WHICH ALL SHARE A FAIR BIT IN MECHANICS
TERRA MYSTIC FEELS LIKE IT HAS SIMILAR QUALITIES
I THINK LA GANJA IS A PRETTY EURO THOUGH IT PLAYS PRETTY DIFFERENTLY
IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GO A LITTLE

SPREAD YOUR GUYS IN THE MAP TO EVERY SO OFTEN FARM RESOURCES FROM THEM TO BUY MORE GUYS AND ULTIMATELY SCORE BASED ON YOUR TOTAL AREA CONTROLLED MULTIPLIED BY POPULARITY IT ADDS COMBAT AND ALTERNATIVE GOALS AND LOTS OF OTHER STUFF BUT AT THE CORE IS SURPRISINGLY SIMILAR
CONCORDIA IS FANTASTIC ONE THING THAT PROMOTES THE COMPETITIVE TEAM PUZZLE IS THAT THE INFORMATION IS ESSENTIALLY PERFECT ALSO IT HAS ENOUGH INTERACTION THAT YOU ARE VERY VESTED IN THE DECISIONS OF OTHER PLAYERS QUANTUM IS A GAME THAT SHARES THESE TWO FEATURES AND VERY LITTLE ELSE IN COMMON I MENTION IT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THE GAME THAT COMES TO MIND IN WHICH I ENJOY HELPING OTHER PEOPLE WITH THEIR PUZZLE
COULD BE BUT IT SURE SEEMS LIKE DOES NOTORIOUSLY SMALL PRINT RUNS FOR ALL GAMES NOT NAMED PANDEMIC THEY'RE SLOW AS MOLASSES WHEN IT COMES TO REPRINTS TOO
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF IT IS TAKING LONGER THAN NORMAL FOR A NEW PRINT RUN OF GAMES BECAUSE OF THE MERGER WITH ASOMODÉE

NOTHING TO DO WITH ASMODEUS ARE INFAMOUSLY PARSIMONIOUS WITH THEIR REPRINTS
EXPANSIONS BY ESPECIALLY GO OUT OF STOCK FOR EXTENDED PERIODS IT'S THE ONLY REASON I HAVEN'T BOUGHT CLASH OF CULTURES BECAUSE THE EXPANSION IS PRETTY MUCH ESSENTIAL TO THE GAME
THE TERRA MYSTIC EXPANSION WILL BE BACK IN STORES EARLY DECEMBER

SOURCE
I AM FRIENDS WITH TH DESIGNERS OF AKROTIRI AND THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE PLANNING TO REPRINT AKROTIRI SOON I'D IMAGINE BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE I'LL LOOK INTO IT IT'S A FANTASTIC TITLE
I BOTH LOVE AND HATE THEY HAVE THE RIGHTS TO SOME OF MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE GAMES BUT THEY HAVE PROBABLY THE WORST RECORD FOR REPRINTING GAMES I'D LOVE TO BUY A COPY OF ASCENDING EMPIRES AND ATLANTIS RISING HOPEFULLY WITH THE MERGER WE'LL SEE SOME MOVEMENT ON THEIR OLDER TITLES
HAVE HAD SEVERAL BAD EXPERIENCES WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH EVEN THOUGH I MET THE GUY AT GENION HOPEFULLY ASMODEUS WILL KEEP THEM IN LINE LEEK THEY DID WITH FFA
SINCE WAS PURCHASED BY FILOSOFIA THEIR TRACK RECORD FOR REPRINTS HAS BEEN HORRIBLE

WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT ASMODEUS GETS THEM IN LINE YOU CAN'T BE A GOOD GAME BUSINESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD GAMES TO SELL IN A WAY I HOPE THAT ASMODEUS JUST ABSORBS KEEPS THE GOOD GAMES AND PHASES IT OUT HASN'T BEEN THE SAME WITHOUT THE
IS HORRIBLE HONESTLY CATAN PLAYERS EXT ALL EXTENSIONS TOO FOR THAT MATTERS WERE OUT OF STOCK IN FRENCH FOR A SINGLE YEAR WORLDWIDE IMAGINE ANY OTHER KIND OF BUSINESS DOING THE SAME THING HALF OF MY CUSTOMERS JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE ME JUST TRY AND FIND ONE FRENCH CATAN RIGHT NOW ON THE INTERNET CHANCES ARE YOU WON'T BE ABLE
I THINK IT MEANS

YOU CAN ATTACK ONCE PER TURN

YOU CAN ONLY ATTACK SOMETHING IN THE SAME ROOM AS YOU WHEN YOU ATTACK UNLESS YOU HAVE AN ITEM THAT STATES OTHERWISE
WE ALWAYS ASSUMED IT MEANS YOU CAN ONLY ATTACK ONCE PER TURN
I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN IT MEANS YOU ONLY GET TO ATTACK ONCE A TURN AND YOU NEED TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS THE ONE YOU ARE ATTACKING HAVING LEFT OVER SPEED SHOULD NOT GET YOU ANOTHER ATTACK OPPONENTS REFERS TO BOTH MONSTERS AND THE TRAITOR HEROES
I AM FINALLY WORKING ON THE SEQUEL TO PAPERBACK TESTED IT AT BGGCON AND PLAYERS REALLY LIKED IT SHOULD BE KICKSTARTING IN THE SPRING
PAPERBACK LOOKS GREAT BUT IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND PEOPLE TO PLAY THIS IN ENGLISH SO I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN FOR THE GERMAN VERSION
I CONSTANTLY HEAR THAT THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL WORD GAME ABOVE ANY OTHER LIKE IT WHAT IS ABOUT THE GAME THAT MAKES IT SO
LITERALLY THE ONLY WORD GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED THAT ISN'T GARBAGE I SHOULD REALLY GET A COPY JUST TO AVOID HAVING TO EVER PLAY BANANAGRAMS AGAIN
REALLY ENJOY IT ALTHOUGH NOT MUCH PLAYER INTERACTION I'M GOOD AT WORD GAMES AND BAD AT DECK BUILDING SO IT'S THE PERFECT GAME IN THAT FRIENDS GET THE SATISFACTION OF KICKING MY PANTS AT A WORD GAME AND WILL THEREFORE PLAY IT AGAIN AND I GET AN ONGOING CHALLENGE IN A WORD GAME WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE MORE LINGUISTICALLY ABLE OPPONENTS EVERYONE HAS WANTED TO PLAY IT AGAIN
I STILL LIKE THE N THAT GIVES 2 CARDS NEXT HAND

REALLY I STILL PLAY THIS CONSTANTLY ON MY IPAD DURING COMMUTE IT'S RELAXING AND FUN

EDIT ALSO THIS GAME LET ME KNOW WHAT TONSIL IS SO GOOD I'M WEIRD
JUST PLAYED THIS TODAY INTRODUCED A NEW PLAYER WHO LOVED IT SUCH A GREAT GAME
THIS IS THE ONLY WORD GAME THAT I'LL SNAP AGREE TO PLAY I ORIGINALLY GOT IT FOR A STAY-IN DATE SURPRISE FOR MY WIFE AND I THINK I'M A BIGGER FAN OF IT THAN HERALDRY

ALSO THE GAME SCALES WELL WITH UP TO THE PLAYER MAX WHICH IS A COLOSSAL WIN IN MY BOOK
I USED TO BE REALLY INTERESTED IN GETTING THIS BUT IT BEING LANGUAGE DEPENDENT MADE ME BACK OFF THE IDEA I DON'T LIVE IN A COUNTRY WITH ENGLISH AS A FIRST LANGUAGE AND THAT FEELS LIKE A REALLY BIG DETRIMENT TO THE GAME WOULD PEOPLE AGREE WITH MY ASSUMPTION OR DOES IT PLAY BETTER THAN I'VE EXPECTED
LOVE THIS GAME HATE THE BOX IN FACT A CORNER OF MY BOX BROKE THIS WEEK MAYBE SOME TAPE INSIDE WILL HELP
THE GERMAN PNP IS STILL MY GAME TO ROPE IN SINCE IT IS VERY EASY TO FEEL LIKE YOU REALLY DO SOMETHING AND THE DECK BUILDING AND SCORING AND CARD POWERS COME JUST NATURALLY IN THE FIRST PLAY FANTASTIC GAME FOR ME AND MY WIFE AND EVERY GAME GROUP I PLAYED IT WITH WE ARE UP TO PLAYS ON IT AND NO SIGNS OF DROPPING IT DEFINITELY WORTH ITS MONEY SOLID FOR US
OPPOSITE OF MOST PEOPLE HERE I ACTUALLY LIKE WORD GAMES BUT THIS IS THE ONLY DECKBUILDER THAT I ENJOY WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT MITIGATING THE RANDOMNESS AND STRATEGIZING AROUND IT IS PART OF THE POINT OF THEM THE RANDOM HAND DRAWS OF DECKBUILDING GAMES ALWAYS FEEL FRUSTRATING AND ARBITRARY TO ME FOR WHATEVER REASON DRAWING RANDOM LETTERS ON THE OTHER HAND JUST MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME AND REALLY LETS ME GET INTO THE ENGINE AND PARTS OF THESE TYPES OF GAMES FOR THAT REASON I'M A BIG FAN
GOT HOOKED ON THE APP AFTER FALLING IN LOVE WITH BURGLE BROS RECENTLY ADDED PAPERBACK TO MY FUGITIVE SHIPMENT GREAT GAME
MILLENNIUM BLADES EACH DOLLAR IS A STACK OF DOLLARS IT REALLY MAKES IT FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DROPPING A LOT OF MANY FOR THE CARDS YOU BUY THOUGHT THE GAME
AIA LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM HAD SOME LOVELY SOLID TRIANGULAR METAL COINS IN EVEN THE REGULAR COPY OF THE GAME
A FRIEND'S COPY OF SCYTHE HAS THESE BEAUTIFUL METAL COINS THAT ARE SO RAD I THINK HE GOT IT FROM DOING A KICKSTARTER OR SOMETHING
FAT STACKS MILLENNIUM BLADES HAS WADS OF PAPER MONEY THAT FIT PERFECTLY WITH THE SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT COLLECTABLE CARD GAMES A LOT OF PEOPLE HATE PAPER MONEY IN GAMES BUT THIS IS JUST SO FITTING THAT IT WORKS
FIREFLY HAS SOME OF THE DOUBLE-SIDED CASH I'VE EVER SEEN
I WOULD SAY SPLENDOR REALLY HEAVY HIGH QUALITY POKER CHIP TYPE THINGS
CHINATOWN HAS SMALL LAMINATED REPLICAS OF US CURRENCY JUST SLIGHTLY ALTERED FOR X DENOMINATIONS
THE MONEY IN TESLA VS EDISON IS THICK CARD STOCK AND GORGEOUS

ASSETS W FIT MAX V AUTO FORMAT LOSSLESS TRUE S
I USE THE METAL COINS FROM MY COPY OF ORLEANS DELUXE FOR ALMOST ALL MY EURO GAMES
THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS FOR ECONOMIC GAMES LIKE PANAMA OR WHERE I USE POKER CHIPS

THE ONLY GAME I HAVE WITH NICE MONEY IS SCYTHE'S METAL COINS
DREAD PIRATE IT'S A SHAME THE GAME IS SO MEDIOCRE THOUGH I MEAN IT'S LIKE TWO NOTCHES ABOVE MACHI BORO SO IT'S NOT AWFUL BUT THAT'S A PRETTY LOW BAR TO CLEAR

OR IT MAY BE A STRETCH TO CALL IT MONEY BUT THE GEMS IN CROSSING ARE PRETTY FANTASTIC THEY LOOK NICE AND ARE SATISFYING TO HANDLE
VITICULTURE AND SCYTHE AND THE BEST COINS IN THE HOBBY
AS FAR AS STYLE I LIKE FIREFLY'S A LOT I AM TURNING INTO THE BIGGEST SANDBOY I WOULDN'T EVEN CALL MYSELF A CASUAL FAN OF THE SHOW

NEXT YEAR SUPPOSED TO BE FIRST QUARTER THEY'RE RELEASING A SET OF THE MONEY THAT'LL BE THE SIZE OF ACTUAL CURRENCY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT NOT THAT MANY DENOMINATIONS THOUGH

PICTURE

LINK
I BOUGHT A SET OF DECENT POKER CHIPS WITH DEMONINATIONS ON THEM FOR LESS THAN ON AMAZON AND USE IT TO REPLACE CURRENCY IN ALMOST EVERYTHING
THE COLLECTORS EDITION OF HOKKAIDO THOSE METAL COINS ARE GREAT
THE MISSUS LOVES COINS WHICH HAVE A SOLID WEIGHT HEAVIER THAN POKER CHIPS
EMPIRES AGE OF DISCOVERY HAS GIANT PLASTIC COINS THEY ARE NICE BUT FOR ME IT FEELS OVERPRODUCED
THE COLLECTOR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT EDITION OF PUERTO RICO HAS REAL COPPER COINS THAT ARE FANTASTIC
DEAL AMERICAN DREAM OF LATE MILLION DOLLAR BILLS
HAS GOOD MONEY IT'S CARDBOARD SO IT HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AND PRETTY RIGID
BRASS SECOND EDITION ALSO COMES WITH METAL COINS
OUR COPY OF THE SMALLSWORD DESIGNER'S EDITION HAS SOME OF THE BEST METAL COINS I'VE EVER SEEN IN FACT THEY WERE THE METAL COINS THAT STARTED US DOWN THE PATH OF UPGRADING THE MONEY IN A BUNCH OF OUR GAMES TO METAL COINS
THE WORST MONEY IS FLEA MARKET
CARSON CITY HAS BROKEN TOKEN UPGRADES WITH METAL COINS AND THEY ARE BY FAR MY FAVORITE CURRENCY
BUCCANEER HAD AWESOME TREASURE PIECES RUBIES PEARLS GOLD BARS AND BARRELS OF RUM
I REALLY LIKE THE MONEY IN THE NETWORKS EACH TOKEN LOOKS LIKE A STACK OF OR WHICH WORKS WELL WITH THE TV CHANNEL THEME

IMAGE NETWORKS

I LOVE TIDDLYWINKS
DO CUSTOM JOBS COUNT SOMEONE'S GAME SET IN ROT CHINA USES LEGIT REAL CURRENCY FROM THE TIME PERIOD BEAUTIFUL
FIREFLY HAS MONEY THAT IS JUST SO LUXURIOUS TO THE TOUCH
IN GENERAL I DESPISE PAPER MONEY FOR GAMES MILLENNIUM BLADES IS AN EXCEPTION BECAUSE THE DOLLAR STACKS DO FIT THE THEME OF THE GAME REALLY WELL IF A GAME HAS PAPER MONEY WE USE POKER CHIPS

CARDBOARD MONEY IS BETTER DIE MACHER IS PROBABLY THE BEST OF THESE FOR STYLE SINCE IT'S BASED ON THE REAL EURO I ALSO LOVE THE MONEY FOR AMAN RE AS THE MONEY IS USED AS CARDS WITHIN THE GAME
BLACK FLEET HAS NICE METAL COINS SATISFYING TO DROP IN THE TABLE

ALSO A FAN OF THE YELLOW GOLDEN DISCS ON CITADELS

ANYTHING WITH CARDBOARD TOKENS FOR MONEY ALWAYS MAKES ME A LITTLE SAD
ELDORADO HAS TINY REPLICAS OF LARGE USD DENOMINATIONS
THE DIFFERENT COINS IN WONDERS DUEL ARE SHAPED LIKE THEY WOULD BE IN THE ANCIENT TIMES MEANING THEY'RE NOT ROUND BUT HAVE A SLIGHT CURVATURE TO THEM I THOUGHT THAT WAS A NICE TOUCH TO AN ALREADY AMAZING GAME
BLACK FLEET HAS METAL CURRENCY STANDARD NOT MANY GAMES HAVE THAT
MY FAVOURITE PAPER MONEY WOULD BE FIREFLY IT'S RIDICULOUSLY GOOD QUALITY

NOT SURE OF MY FAVOURITE OVERALL
I ALWAYS LIKED LORDS OF COINS AS WELL AS THE COINS IN AGE OF EMPIRE'S III THE AGE OF DISCOVERY
THE GUY WHO WASN'T ENCUMBERED BY ENEMIES IN HIS SQUARE FELT STRONGER THAN CONAN
WHICH CONAN GAME ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
WE JUST PLAYED THE FIRST SCENARIO TODAY I WAS THE OVERLORD

CONAN IS A FREAKING BEAST HE ALMOST DID A ONE-SHOT ON THE PICT WARCHIEF FORTUNATELY FOR ME THE GUY PLAYING THE MAGE DECIDED TO PLAY AGGRESSIVELY TOO AND MY SNAKE CHEWED HIM AND DID NOT SPITTED HIM OUT THAT WAS KICK AND BRUTAL CONAN THAN WAS STALLED BY THE SNAKE AND SHEVATAS HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THE GIRL

AT THE END OF ROUND CONAN RAN AWAY WITH THE GIRL AFTER HE LEFT HIS SHIELD BEHIND ON ROUND I'VE TRIED TO STALL SHEVATAS WHO HAD THE HEAD BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH HE BARELY MADE IT OUT DAMN IT

FUN GAME BUT THE SETUP IS A PAIN IN THE ASS AND THE RULES ARE ATROCIOUS GOOD THING I HAD THE VERSION IN FRENCH ON MY IPAD I WILL HAVE TO FIN A WAY TO STORE ALL THE COMPONENTS MORE EFFICIENTLY
MUST ONE PLAYER ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE OVERLORD I LOVE THE WORLD OF CONAN BUT AM APPREHENSIVE OF THE OVERLORD ROLE IN A GAME
JUST GOT MINE IN THE MAIL THIS WEEK WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THE RULEBOOK AND LEARNING HOW TO PLAY FROM IT VS ADVICE FOR LEARNING IT THROUGH ANOTHER SOURCE I EAST VIDEO ONLINE
I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME AFTER EVERY SESSION YOU FEEL LIKE YOU JUST PARTICIPATED IN A MOVIE IT'S SO CINEMATIC AND WIN OR LOSE EVERYONE HAS SO MUCH FUN I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME HIGHLY ENOUGH
I THINK RAPTOR WOULD BE PERFECT IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT
YEAH YOU BASICALLY JUST DESCRIBED RAPTOR THEY WILL LOVE IT
TRIASSIC TERROR IS THE ONE I RECOMMEND THE MOST

SMASH-UP HAS A FEW DINOSAURS INVOLVED AND WON'T BREAK THE BANK

TRIAS DIRECTLY INVOLVES DINOS AND HAS DINOSAUR MEEDLESS IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A COPY BUT THERE'S A FEW FLOATING FOR SALE IN THE INTERNET

EVOLUTION MIGHT BE UP HIS ALLEY EVEN IF IT DOESN'T DIRECTLY HAVE DINOSAURS IT STILL HAS THE FEEL THEME OF THEM

AVO EACH PLAYER CONTROLS A SPECIES OF DINOSAUR AND TRIES TO SURVIVE CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE FIGHTING FOR TERRITORY

EDIT THIS GAME IS A BIT EXPENSIVE RIGHT NOW DUE TO BEING OUT OF PRINTING
THANKS FOR ALL THE SUGGESTIONS SOME OF THESE GAMES ARE SPOT ON BUT HARD TO FIND ONLINE PLACED A FEW BIDS ON EBAY SO FINGERS CROSSED
JURASSATTACK 2 PLAYER FILLER CARD GAME WITH HEAVY DINOSAUR THEME AND SURPRISINGLY DEEP GAMEPLAY FOR WHAT IT IS
FORBIDDEN ISLAND DESERT ARE DECENT LIGHT FOR FAMILIES
LANTERNS IS GREAT IT'S A TILE LAYING GAME THAT WAS RECENTLY FEATURED ON TABLETOP SO CHECK THAT OUT FOR MORE INFO I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST LOOKING INTO LOTUS WHICH IS A CARD LAYING GAME WHERE YOU BUILD FLOWERS PETAL BY PETAL IT'S GOT SOME GOOD STRATEGY AND LOOKS GREAT ON A TABLE
THE ZOOLERETTO AND COLRORETTO GAMES YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK OUT FORBIDDEN ISLAND COULD BE A GOOD ONE AS WELL
I AGREE WITH THE OTHERS THAT YOU SHOULD GIVE FORBIDDEN ISLAND FORBIDDEN DESERT A TRY
ONE PROBLEM THAT THIS GAME SEEMS TO HAVE IS THAT AFTER SOME TIME IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME IS MY ASSUMPTION RIGHT OR AM I TOTALLY WRONG ABOUT THIS

THAT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG SOME TIME IS BEAR IN MIND IT IS A LIGHT APPROACHABLE GAME THAT PLAYS VERY QUICKLY THERE'S A NECESSARY LIMITATION ON DEPTH TO MAKE IT QUICK AND EASY TO PLAY BUT WITH THE DIFFERENT MODES AND ROOM RANDOMIZATION I DON'T THINK IT'S A FAIR CONCERN UNLESS YOU SIT DOWN AND PLAY IT INTENSIVELY OVER AND OVER THAT WILL OF COURSE BRING SIMILARITIES TO THE FORE
EH I'D SAY THAT EVERY GAME MIGHT GET REPETITIVE AFTER SOME TIME ROOM HAS GOT SEVERAL GAME MODES YOU CAN PLAY IN COOP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN TEAMS RECENTLY I'VE BOUGHT AN EXPANSION FOR THE GAME WHICH MAKES IT EVEN MORE INTERESTING I'D SAY YEAH GO FOR IT AS R FLYLICEPLICK SAID IT'S VERY LIGHT AND APPROACHABLE
I'VE HAD IT FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW AND I STILL ENJOY PLAYING I'M NOT A SUPER COMPETITIVE PERSON SO I BET THAT HELPS CONTRIBUTE TO IT'S LONGEVITY
I ORIGINALLY GOT HOKKAIDO WHEN I FIRST STARTED GETTING INTO BOARD GAMING I THINK ITS A GREAT GAME TO PLAY WITH AS THE ART IS BEAUTIFUL AND THE SIMPLICITY MAKES IT EASY TO TEACH THAT SAID I AGREE WITH THE CRITICISM YOU READ IT'S TOO BASIC WITH TOO FEW MEANINGFUL CHOICES FOR ME TO REALLY ENJOY THESE DAYS
TOTALLY REPAYABLE BUT NOT REALLY A HARD CORE CONCEPT OF REPAYABLE I ENJOY REPLAYING IT WHENEVER I PLAY IT BUT IT'S USUALLY WITH IT'S SIMPLY NOT A COMPETITIVELY THEMED GAME BEST PLAYED WITH A GLASS OF WINE OR TEA
HOKKAIDO IS ONE OF THE FEW GAMES I FEEL THE EXPANSION SPECIFICALLY CROSSROADS REALLY IMPROVES THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH DIFFICULT CHOICES IN THE BASE GAME TO KEEP IT ENGAGING IT'S FINE FOR PLAYING WITH CHILDREN OR THOUGH SO IN THAT RESPECT YES I WOULD SAY IT'S A GOOD CHOICE FOR PEOPLE IN THE MOOD FOR SOMETHING SIMPLE
I AM TESTING THE IOS APP AND I'M PLAYING IT PROBABLY TIMES A DAY AND ENJOYING THEM ALL
I LIKE IT A LOT I GOT IT WHEN FAIRLY NEW TO THE HOBBY YEARS AGO AND STILL I INTRODUCED IT TO NEW PLAYERS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND THEY ALL LOVED IT I MUST SAY THAT GETTING THE FIRST EXPANSION CALLED CROSSROADS IS MORE OR LESS A MUST MAKES THE CHOICES AND COLLECTING IN THE GAME MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE
IT'S A GREAT GAME TO INTRODUCE NEW GAMERS TO THE TABLE ESP IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR NEETUP OR HOLD GAMING PARTIES OFTEN I OWN IT AND THAT'S HONESTLY THE ONLY TIME IT HITS THE TABLE FOR US THAT BEING SAID I'M GLAD WE HAVE IT FOR THAT REASON
A FRIEND OF MINE OWNS IT PERSONALLY I DON'T CARE FOR IT BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL TYPES THAT LOVE IT AND REPEATEDLY ASK TO PLAY IT

I FEEL LIKE THE REPLACEABILITY WOULD BE QUITE LOW FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO PLAY LOTS OF BOARD GAMES BUT IT IS CERTAINLY A FAN FAVOURITE FOR NEWCOMERS
I FOUND IT FUN TO PLAY I HAD IT FOR YEARS I REALLY LOVED IT MY PARTNER DIDN'T AND MY FRIENDS FOUND IT A BIT BORING I THINK IS A GREAT GAME TO PLAY WITH I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT
ITS A VERY CHILL GAME ANYONE CAN PLAY AND DO WELL ENOUGH

BEST PLAYER INTERMINGLED WITH DISCUSSION AND DRINKS
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL VACATION HIDING A NASTY TAKE THAT BLOCKING GAME PLAY AGGRESSIVELY IN UNDER MINUTES IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING WITH
I PLAYED IT ONCE AND SOLD IT I GOT IT TO PLAY WITH NON GAMERS AND THEY SHOWED NO INTEREST COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE BORED AT THE LACK OF DECISIONS THEY LIKE OTHER GAMES WITH BETTER CHOICES THAT ARE SIMPLE

IT'S BARELY A GAME AT NO POINT IN MY PLAY DID I SEE ANY REASON NOT TO JUST GO TO THE NEXT OPEN SPACE I'M SURE THERE COULD BE A REASON BUT I WILL NEVER KNOW LOL
THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS ADD A LITTLE REPEATABILITY BUT IT'S ONLY BEEN BROKEN OUT TIMES IN OUR GROUP I STILL LOVE IT THOUGH AND AM HOPING TO SNAG THE EXPANSION THIS XMAS TO OPEN IT BACK UP TO OUR PLAYERS
IT'S GOT THIS PRETTY BRUTAL ECONOMIC ENGINE THAT'S HARD TO USE ONCE SOMEONE MASTERS IT THEY WILL BEAT EVERYONE EVERY TIME UNTIL EVERYONE MASTERS IT

IF NO ONE AT YOUR TABLE GETS GOOD AT THE ECONOMIC ENGINE IT CAN BE PLAYED FOR A LONG TIME AS A SOMEWHAT RANDOM CANDYLANDESQUE GAME ALMOST IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE BUT IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE
IF YOU COULD RESELL AT A PRICE THAT SOMEONE WOULD BUY THEN EVERYONE WINS SOMEONE WHO WILL ENJOY IT JUST BOUGHT IT YOU ARE A BIT BETTER OFF MONEY WISE SO WHY NOT SELL IF IT HELPS YOU OUT
THAT'S AN AWESOME FAGS IF THEY DIDN'T HIKE UP THE PRICE AND THEY'RE TELLING YOU TO TURN A PROFIT IF YOU CAN HIGHLY RECOMMEND FLIPPING IT AND GOING BACK WITH THE MONEY YOU MADE TO BUY MORE GAMES FROM THAT STORE


ON A SIDE NOTE I WILL SAY THAT AGRICOLA ABAS IS AN AWESOME GAME THAT FITS IN THE REALM OF 2 PLAYER PATCHWORK IT'S SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND BUT HAS A TON OF STRATEGY IN IT THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF OTHER GAMES IN THE 2 PLAYER SPECTRUM THAT YOU COULD EASILY PICK UP MAYBE EVEN OF THEM AND STILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER AFTER FLIPPING THIS ONE


TL R DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT BUYING LOW AND SELLING HIGH USE THAT MONEY TO BUY YOUR FOLKS MORE GAMES
AMAZON IS NOT ACCURATE BOTS ARE SETTING THOSE PRICES AND THEY TEND TO BE TOO OPTIMISTIC CHECK COMPLETED SOLD LISTINGS ON EBAY TO SEE WHAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET

IF IT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT THAT'S WORTH MORE TO YOU THAN THE GAME IS GO AHEAD THAT'S SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND ABAS WILL PROBABLY BE REPRINTED
HAVING SOLD A FEW GAMES THAT ARE WORTH MORE THAN THEIR LSRP VALUE JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS LISTED AS SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL SELL BUT SOMETIMES YOU DO GET LUCKY

THE POINTS YOUR STORE MADE ARE VERY VALID IF MONEY IS TIGHT OR YOU REALLY WANT TO PROFIT OVER OWNING THE GAME JUST SELL IT HOWEVER KEEP IN MIND YOU HAVE TO FACTOR IN SHIPPING AND FEES AS WELL TO YOUR SALE WHICH DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU SELL IT YOU CAN MITIGATE THAT A BIT

SHOULD YOU SELL THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER INTERESTING 2 PLAYER GAMES TO TRY AND YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY THE REAL THING AGRICOLA OR GIVE THEM AN AWESOME GAME SINCE YOU BOUGHT IT AND MAKE SURE THEY KNOW THAT IT'S CURRENTLY RARE AND OUT OF PRINT THEY'LL PROBABLY BE EVEN HAPPIER TO HEAR THAT




AMAZON IS A SITE WHERE PEOPLE PRICE HACK BOARD GAMES IF YOU EVER SEE SOMETHING OVERLY EXPENSIVE THERE THERE ARE OFTEN MANY OTHER PLACES SELLING IT FOR LESS

IF YOU CAN ARBITRAGE YOUR FIND DO WHAT YOU NEED TO JUST DON'T THINK OF AMAZON AS A FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR GAMES
GIFT IT

I DON'T THINK THEY'RE WORTH AS MUCH AS THEY ARE LISTED FOR ON AMAZON JUST QUICKLY BROWSED SOLD SECTION AND IT LOOKS LIKE USED BASE GAME AND EXPANSIONS GO FOR OR SO ALTOGETHER LOOKS LIKE SEALED THEY ARE ABOUT OR SO EACH I'M ASSUMING YOURS ARE SEALED BUT I DOUBT ANYONE WOULD PAY FOR THEM REALISTICALLY I THINK YOUR LOOKING AT MAKING MINUS WHAT YOU PAID ORIGINALLY SHIPPING PACKAGING INSURANCE FEES AND TIME

WHAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING DOING I ESSENTIALLY CONSIDER SCALPING

ON THE ONE HAND I WOULDN'T DO IT I DON'T NEED TO BILK A FELLOW GAMER FOR A FEW BUCKS ESPECIALLY AROUND THE HOLIDAYS NOT JUDGING YOU JUST WOULDN'T DO IT ALSO I WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH SELLING SHIPPING IT ONLINE AND THE RISKS THAT COME WITH THAT LASTLY I'M A LITTLE LAZY ESPECIALLY AROUND THE HECTIC AND STRESSFUL HOLIDAY SEASON AND IF I HAVE A PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE GIFT IN HAND I WOULD JUST GIFT IT

ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE SOLD ONLINE BUT WE COULDN'T GET OUR MONEY OUT FOR LIKE TWO WEEKS AFTER ITEMS SOLD DOUBLE CHECK HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET YOUR MONEY THROUGH WHATEVER SITE YOU DECIDE TO USE ALSO IF NOT FOR YOU THEN THIS COPY MAY HAVE NEVER MADE IT OUT INTO THE WILD IT COULD HAVE BEEN TRASHED AT SOME POINT I WOULD RECOMMEND SELLING LOCALLY IF POSSIBLE COULD PROBABLY SQUEEZE OUT A LITTLE MORE IF YOU WAIT UNTIL SHIPPING DEADLINES FOR CHRISTMAS HAVE PASSED

GOOD LUCK WHICHEVER WAY YOU DECIDE HOPE THEY LIKE IT OR HOPE YOU MAKE MORE THAN MY ESTIMATES
THERE'S A COPY ENDING ON EBAY TOMORROW THAT'S CURRENTLY BID AT ONE ENDING TUESDAY AT WHICH IS WHAT I PAID FOR IT ON AMAZON LAST YEAR THE COMPLETED LISTINGS SHOWS THEM SELLING AT AUCTION FOR AROUND WITH A COUPLE UP TO WITH FREE SHIPPING THE ONES GOING FOR MORE INCLUDE EXPANSIONS

UNLESS I'M MAKING AN ABSOLUTE KILLING I DON'T SELL GAMES I LIKE AND WANT TO KEEP ESPECIALLY OOP GAMES I KNOW AND MAYFAIR ARE NOW PART OF THE ASMODEUS UMBRELLA BUT NAME IS NOW ON AGRICOLA WHILE ABAS WAS A PRODUCT NOT SURE HOW ANY OF THAT MAY AFFECT IT GETTING REPRINTED BUT I'M SURPRISED IT'S NOT BEEN BY NOW
TRY THE COMPLEAT STRATEGIST OR THE UNCOMMON
I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE SIDED STORE IN BROOKLYN
COMPLETE STRATEGIST SHOULD HAVE IT

I WOULD DEFINITELY STOP BY THE UNCOMMON AS WELL DOLLARS TO PLAY ALL DAY WEEKDAY WEEKENDS THERE WITH THEIR FAIRLY LARGE BOARD GAME COLLECTION PLAYED TIME STORIES THERE MYSELF
WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE YOU

IF YOU'RE IN EUROPE CHECK OUT WHICH HAS A GREAT COLLECTION OF PIECES

IT'S ALSO WORTH FINDING CHEAP COPIES OF RUBBISH GAMES SO YOU CAN CANNIBALISH THE PIECES I RECENTLY GOT A COPY OF NETZWERK WHICH IS NOT VERY GOOD BUT ONLY COST AND CAME WITH TONS OF WOODEN CUBES STICKS AND HOUSES
GO TO R TABLETOPGAMEDESIGN AND CHECK THE LINKS IN THE SIDEBAR
I'D CHECK YOUR LOCAL FAGS MINE LABYRINTH GAMES AND PUZZLES DC HAS WHOLE BINS OF THESE SORTS OF PIECES YOU CAN PICK AND MIX FOR CENTS
NOTHING YET I ORDERED 2 GAMES AND 2 BOOKS ON THE AND STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A SHIPPING NOTICE LOOKING AT THEIR FAQ IT SEEMS TO RUN A TAD SLOW DURING THESE HOLIDAY SALE EVENTS
I'M IN THE SAME BOAT PLACED AN ORDER DAYS AGO RECEIVED AN EMAIL WITH AN ORDER NUMBER JUST SAYING MY ORDER WAS RECEIVED BUT NOTHING AFTER THAT AND NO CHARGES TO MY BANK EITHER

AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AN OBVIOUS WAY TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT THE ORDER I PLACED A GENERIC QUERY WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT NOT SURE WHEN IF I WILL HEAR BACK

SEEMS LIKE A REALLY BAD METHOD TO HANDLE THEIR HOLIDAY SALES AND I'M NOT REALLY HOPEFUL I WILL RECEIVE THE ORDER IN FACT

BUT YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT THE ONLY ONE
SOMEONE GOT A REPLY BACK FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT ITEMS WILL BEGIN SHOPPING ON MONDAY
SAME SITUATION HERE I'M NOT UPSET ABOUT THE DELAY PER SE THIS IS A BIG SALE WITH A LOT OF ORDERS FOR THEM TO HANDLE I DO THINK THEY'D AVOID A LOT OF PROBLEMS BY BEING MORE WITH THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DELAY AND AN EASIER WAY TO TRACK THE STATUS OF YOUR ORDER
THIS THREAD WAS POSTED A FEW DAYS AGO ON THE SAME SUBJECT OP RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM FFA SAYING THEY GET HUGE ORDER VOLUME AND THAT THEY WILL BEGIN SHIPPING ON NOVEMBER
I STILL KEEP MY FINISHED COPY ON THE SHELF ONCE A YEAR AROUND THE DATE WE FINISHED IT WE PULL IT OUT TO PLAY A GAME OR TWO ON OUT CUSTOM BOARD I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING THE BOARD FRAMED AND HANGING IT UP IN THE GAME ROOM THOUGH
DID YOU OPEN THE DO NOT OPEN EVER YOU CAN PROBABLY GET A COUPLE PLAYS OUT OF THAT IF NOT
THAT NAME THOUGH UGH
FOR ANY OTHER OUT THERE WHO ARE AS CONFUSED AS I WAS THE NAME ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOU SAY ZED INCORRECTLY
THINK OF IT AS PLAYING ON HOW GERMANS STEREOTYPICALLY SAY THE
HIT ZEE ROAD THE GERMAN MISPRONUNCIATION IS A PART OF THE AMERICAN CULTURAL ZEITGEIST WITH THE CONTEXT OF A ZOMBIE GAME IT PICKS UP ANOTHER LAYER OF MEANING CLEVER BUT I CAN SEE HOW IT WOULD BE QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE REFERENCES THE TITLE IS MAKING
TELESTRATIONS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOMENTS WAS WHEN ACORN WAS READ BY A PERSON WITH POOR ENGLISH A CORN THE MORE CONFUSION THE BETTER

IF ALL ARENT PLAYING YOU COULD PLAY TICKET TO RIDE
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND A FAKE ARTIST GOES TO NEW YORK IT'S LIKE TELESTRATIONS MEETS SPYFAULT WITH ALMOST NO LANGUAGE DEPENDENCE EVERYBODY GETS A SHEET OF PAPER WITH ONE WORD AND THEY TAKE TURNS DRAWING A SINGLE LINE ON A PIECE OF PAPER JUST LIKE IN SPYFAULT EVERYONE HAS THE SAME ANSWER EXCEPT ONE PERSON WHO HAS A BLANK CARD THE GOAL IS TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS JUST PRETENDING WHILE THAT PLAYER HAS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE DRAWING IS
YOU COULD TRY CODENAMES PICTURES LESS LANGUAGE DEPENDENT THAN THE ORIGINAL SUSHI GO PARTY PLAYS UP TO AND SHOULD WORK
I'D SAY RESISTANCE YOU'D THINK YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO PLAY A GAME THAT'S ALL ABOUT TALKING WITH PEOPLE THAT AREN'T COMFORTABLE SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE BUT IT IS REALLY GOOD FOR GETTING PEOPLE ENGAGED IN A FUN ATMOSPHERE SPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE ONE OR TWO ASSHOLES IN THE GROUP

I ONLY SAY THIS BECAUSE I HAD A GIRLFRIEND THAT WORKED IN A LAB WITH A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AS WAS SHE AND THEY LOVED PLAYING THAT GAME ANY MISCOMMUNICATION PEOPLE HAD JUST MADE THE GAME EVEN MORE FUN
TRURO THE GAME OF THE PATH IS A TILE LAYING GAME THAT HAS NO LANGUAGE INVOLVED AND IS VERY EASY TO PICK UP

THERE IS ALSO TRURO OF THE SEAS WHICH PUTS A DIFFERENT SPIN ON THE GAME
BONANZA IS A CLASSIC NEGOTIATION GAME THAT TRANSCENDS LANGUAGE THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW GOOD ENGLISH THEY JUST NEED TO MAKE GOOD DEALS IT PLAYS PEOPLE VERY WELL
DIXIT HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR AMONG MY NON ENGLISH SNEAKING CROWD DOG IS EASY TO EXPLAIN WITH PLAYERS
SURVIVE IS EASY TO EXPLAIN AND HAS NO ENGLISH TEXT TICKET TO RIDE IS EASY ONCE YOU GET THE CONCEPTS DOWN
WE'VE ENJOYED WITH WAGERS AS LONG AS YOUR SPEAKER CAN ASK AND ANSWER QUESTIONS THE TRIVIA IS SUCH THAT IT'S TOTALLY OK NOT TO KNOW THE ANSWER AND EVEN WHEN SOMEONE'S WAY OFF ON AN ANSWER THEY STILL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING BASED ON THEIR BETTING IT TAKES MINUTES TO TEACH AND CAN BE PLAYED EASILY IN A LUNCH BREAK
MYSTERIUM COULD BE GOOD I'M NOT SURE HOW EASY IT IS TO COMMUNICATE THE RULES THEY'RE A LITTLE ODD SKIP THE BETTING MECHANICS AND JUST DO THREE GUESSES AT THE END

BUT ITS DEPENDENCE ON ONE PERSON ACTUALLY BEING UNABLE TO SPEAK IS WHAT SHOULD MAKE THIS GAME GOOD FOR YOUR GROUP
NOT ALL ARE FOR MULTIPLAYER BUT ADDING TO THE LIST GHOST BLITZ SPOT IT ZOMBIE DICE CARCASSONNE HANAFI JENA AND BLOCKUS APPLES TO APPLES PICTURE EDITION REQUIRES ONLY KNOWLEDGE OF ONE WORD AT A TIME
RHINO HERO FOR THE SILLIEST FUN ADULTS CAN HAVE AT THE OFFICE
FAKE ARTIST GOES TO NEW YORK IS GREAT WITH LARGE GROUPS THAT INCLUDES ENGLISH SPEAKERS I PLAYED WITH THIS SORT OF GROUP AND IT WENT OVER REALLY WELL CHINESE SPEAKERS WOUND UP DOMINATING

PLUS ALL YOU NEED TO PLAY IS SOME MARKERS AND A BIG DRAWING PAD
WE PLAY MASCARADE WITH AN OFFICE GROUP AND IT'S POPULAR BUT USUALLY ONLY WITH OR MORE GREAT WITH THE EXPANSION AS THE PUPPET MASTER CARD GETS PEOPLE SWAPPING SEATS SO MAY BE GOOD FOR A SHY GROUP ZEUS ON THE LOOSE IS A RECENT FAVOURITE AS WELL AS ITS VERY QUICK AS A FILLER
SLAP MIGHT WORK IT'S FOR PLAYERS AND USUALLY LEADS TO A LOT OF LAUGHING WITHOUT A TON OF RULES NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN
DOESN'T INVOLVE ACTUAL LANGUAGE AT ALL BUT SEEMS LIKE A FUN SORT OF PARTY GAME
MAYBE BANG THE DICE GAME IT'S A VERY FAST AND SIMPLE HIDDEN IDENTITY GAME THAT MOSTLY HAS IMAGE BASED INFORMATION
BETWEEN TWO CITIES AND CASH N GUNS POP TO MIND AS DEPENDENT GAMES THAT CAN PLAY UP TO
I'M BIASED BUT TRY NUMENKO IT PLAYS LIKE SCRABBLE BUT INSTEAD OF LETTERS MAKING WORDS YOU USE NUMBERS TO MAKE SUMS EVERYBODY USES ARITHMETIC IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE AND FOR THE NOT SO COMFORTABLE WITH MATHS THERE IS NUMENKO IN A BAG WHICH PLAYS LIKE BANANAGRAMS
SUSHI GO NO WORDS ON THE CARDS VERY SIMPLE
PICTURE PICTURE
PERHAPS SCRUTINEYES
BATTLETECH YOU CAN EVEN USE THE SAME TERRAIN SINCE IT IS HEX BASED BUT HAS A LOT MORE DEPTH ALSO THERE IS BATTLETECH ALPHA STRIKE IF YOU WANT MORE MACHS WITH LESS RULES
BATTLEMASTERS IT WAS THE PREDECESSOR TO HEROSCAPE HAS LESS TERRAIN BUILDING THOUGH JUST A TOWER AND A FEW HANDFULS OF FORDS DITCHES AND SIMILAR BUT THE COMBAT IS INTERESTING THE TWO FACTIONS ARE DISTINCTLY ASYMMETRICAL
MAGIC PLANESWALKERS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU'RE GONNA GET
HEROSCAPE TERRAIN IS HARD TO BEAT BUY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AND USE IT FOR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO POKE AROUND SOME MINIATURE WARGAMING SUBS WARMAHORDES IS PROBABLY A GOOD STARTING POINT
FROSTGRAVE QUITE AN ENJOYABLE TABLETOP GAME THE RULES ARE UNDER BUCKS ON AMAZON AND YOU CAN USE ANY TYPES OF MINIS YOU HAVE
YOU COULD LOOK INTO GETTING MICE AND MYSTICS IT'S A CO-OP RPG THAT WOULD SIT WELL WITH YOUNGER AUDIENCES MY GIRLFRIEND AND I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THROUGH THE CORE GAME AND THE EXPANSIONS OVER THE PAST YEAR THE RULES ARE PRETTY SIMPLE TOO
MACHS VS MINIONS IT MAY BE HARD TO LOCATE RIGHT NOW BUT IT FITS THE BILL

2 MARVEL LEGENDARY SUPERHEROS ARE ALWAYS FUN AND BASED ON YOUR LISTS THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD INTRO TO DECK BUILDING GAMES
THE BIG BOOK OF MADNESS
BURGLE BROS
THIS ONE'S A BIT DIFFERENT FROM YOUR OTHER GAMES BUT I CANNOT RECOMMEND ESCAPE THE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE ENOUGH SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN DID A GOOD REVIEW IF YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE I'VE YET TO PLAY WITH SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T ENJOY THEMSELF
WHILE YOU CAN STILL GET IT YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT SPACE HULK DEATH ABEL AND SEE IF IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR SON
IT IS A REALLY GOOD COOP GAME THAT YOU CAN PLAY SOLO VERY WELL
DOES YOUR SON LIKE SWORD AND BOARD FANTASY IF SO LITERALLY STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUY DESCENT AND GET THE COMPANION APP ROAD TO LEGEND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED
PANDEMIC LEGACY IS REALLY AWESOME

EDIT ACCIDENTALLY SUBMIT WITHOUT EXPLAINING LEGACY IS PANDEMIC EXCEPT EACH TIME YOU PLAY A GAME THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT GAME HAVE CONSEQUENCES ON THE BOARD CHARACTERS AND FUTURE GAMES THERE ARE MISSIONS ONE FOR EACH MONTH AND EACH MISSION HAS A DIFFERENT OBJECTIVE THE BOX COMES WITH A BUNCH OF SECRET POCKETS AND CARDS AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TELL YOU WHAT TO OPEN BEFORE EACH GAME DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST GAME
GHOST FIGHT IN TREASURE HUNTERS AKA GEISTER GEISTER SHATSUCHMEISTER HAS AN EASY AND HARD MODE AND IS FUN

THE GAME IS PRETTY FUN AS WELL THERE'S A NEW HARD MODE DECK THAT I'VE PLAYED MAYBE NOW AND STILL HAVE YET TO BEAT
MACHS VS MINIONS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE BEFORE CHRISTMAS I GOT IT TO PLAY WITH MY YEAR OLD SON AND IT'S GETTING NOTHING BUT STELLAR REVIEWS

IF NOT GO FOR ONE OF THE DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS ADVENTURE SERIES GAMES MY FAVORITE IS WRATH OF ASHARDALON BUT THEY'RE ALL FUN THE OTHERS ARE CASTLE RAVENLOFT LEGEND OF AND TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL
DEFENDERS OF THE REALM IS FUN IF HE LIKES FANTASY AS A THEME IT IS A HUGE GAME THAT CAN REALLY BE EXPANDED ALSO IT MAY BE SLIGHTLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE CO-OP GAMES THAT YOU HAVE NOW BUT THERE IS A LOT IN THE BOX AND IT HAS AN EPIC FEEL
THE NEW MARKHAM HORROR CG CO-OP CARD GAME IS PROBABLY OUTSIDE HIS AGE RANGE UNLESS HE'S REALLY INTO SPOOKY STUFF
PATHFINDER IS A FUN RPG MIGHT BE A BIT HEAVY FOR A YEAR OLD BUT ITS STILL NOT BAD AND INTRODUCES YOU TO THE DIE CHECK MECHANIC
I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT ABOUT CASTLE PANIC AT LEAST THE BASE GAME BUT THE WIZARD'S TOWER EXPANSION WOULD BEEF UP THE GAME TO SOMETHING HE WOULD ENJOY MUCH MORE STRATEGY INVOLVED
DARK MOON IT'S CO-OP BUT WITH A HIDDEN TRAITOR MECHANIC
STAR TREK PANIC IT TAKES CASTLE PANIC AND ADDS SOME COMPLEXITY I REALLY ENJOYED THE ONE GAME I HAVE PLAYED TO DATE
JUST TO NAME A FEW

LEGENDS OF ANDOR

ESCAPE THE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE

THE CAPTAIN IS DEAD

DEAD PANIC

DUNGEON FIGHTER

END

DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES
THUNDERBIRDS
NEAT THEME COOL BITS DESIGNED BY PANDEMIC CREATOR MATT LEACOCK
GHOST STORIES S GREAT BUT SUPER HARD TO BEAT
TIME STORIES ALSO GREAT BUT MAYBE TOO MATURE
PROJECT ELITE MICE MYSTICS LEGENDARY MARVEL
I WOULD SAY FORBIDDEN ISLAND OR FORBIDDEN DESERT WOULD BE GOOD FOR
FUSE IT'S ONE OF MY YEAR OLD NIECE'S FAVORITES
I THINK MYSTERIUM SHOULD BE FINE FOR KIDS IT'S BASICALLY SCOOBY DOO LEVELS OF SPOOKY

THERE'S ALSO THE MARKHAM HORROR CG WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT DEPENDS MORE ON THE CHILD I WOULD HAVE LOVED IT BUT THEN MY FIRST MODERN BOARD GAME WAS ZOMBIES WHEN I WAS LIKE SO

HANAFI IS ANOTHER CLASSIC CO-OP A BIT ON THE LIGHTER SIDE BUT MAKES A GOOD STOCKING STUFFER
HAVE YOU TRIED THE PATHFINDER ADVENTURE CARD GAMES

I JUST HAD A GREAT THANKSGIVING PLAYING THAT WITH A NEPHEW AROUND THAT AGE
CONSIDER PANDEMIC THE CURE GREAT GAME AND MY SON IN FEB AND I BOTH ENJOY IT MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL ALSO MAYBE LOOK AT PAPERBACK IT INCLUDES A SOLO COOP MODE
THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO WRITE ALL OF THAT JUST WATCHED EXPLANATION OF HOW TO PLAY IA AND I'M REALLY LIKING IT GOING TO FIND A SH ONE NOW

DREADNOUGHT WAS LIKE A BIG ROBOT THING LIKE I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I ONLY PLAYED SH ONCE AS A KID
WELL I'VE WATCHED A GAMEPLAY AID OF BOTH AND GONE FOR SPACE HULK RIGHT NOW MAINLY BECAUSE I RUN A SCHOOL LUNCH CLUB AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE QUICKER GAME PLUS IT IS USUALLY OUT OF PRINTING
PROBABLY GO FOR IA AS A LATE XMAS PRESENT TO MYSELF
CHEERS ALL
I'VE PLAYED THEM BOTH A FAIR BIT

SPACE HULK IS MUCH QUICKER TO SET UP AND PLAY AND THE RULES ARE PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD
YOU CAN EASILY GET THROUGH SEVERAL ROUNDS OF SPACE HULK IN AN EVENING AND GET THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN BOOK IN A FEW SESSIONS
THAT BEING SAID ONCE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN BOOK YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH PLAYED IT ALL
IT DOES HAVE GOO REPLACEABILITY TRYING DIFFERENT TACTICS SWITCHING BETWEEN WHO PLAYS THE GENE STEALERS BUT THE MISSIONS ALL START THE SAME
IT'S ALSO SO IT'S GOT THAT

IMPERIAL ASSAULT TAKES TIME TO SET UP AND TIME TO PLAY BUT IS MUCH MUCH DEEPER THAN SPACE HULK AND FAR LESS LINEAR
IN AN EVENING YOU MAY GET THROUGH ROUNDS DEPENDING ON HOW QUICKLY YOU GET THROUGH THEM
GETTING THROUGH A WHOLE CAMPAIGN CAN TAKE A WHILE
THE RULES ARE FAR MORE DENSE BUT THERE'S MORE GOING ON SO THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED
EVERY PLAY THROUGH WILL BE DIFFERENT AS YOUR CHOICES AND RANDOMIZATION WILL AFFECT WHICH MISSIONS YOU PLAY BETWEEN THE STORY MISSIONS
AND AS WITH SPACEHULK YOU CAN SWITCH WHO PLAYS REBELS AND WHO PLAYS IMPS
STRONGLY RECOMMEND PLAYING THIS ONE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE
PLUS IT'S STAR WARS VADER IS A
MAYBE DREADNAUGHT IS IN REFERENCE TO THE CLASS OF POWER ARMOR THE SPACE MARINES ARE WEARING AND THE POOR CHAP CONFUSED DREADNAUGHT WITH TERMINATOR HEAVY ASSAULT TYPE ARMOR IT IS BIG AND BULKY AND EXPLAINS WHY IT TAKES A FULL MOVE GOT TURN MORE THAN DEGREES AND WHY YOU CANNOT PASS ANOTHER MARINE IN A CORRIDOR LOVE IT

ANYWAY FOR YOUR QUESTION I HAVE NEVER PLAYED IMPERIAL ASSAULT BUT I HAVE HAD MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLAY IT THAT I HAVE HAD TO PLAY MY COPY OF SPACE HULK I GUESS IT MIGHT BE THE THEME BUT THE STAR WARS IP SEEMS MUCH MORE OPEN AND AVAILABLE TO PLAYERS THAN THE UNIVERSE ADD TO THAT THE MASS NUMBERS OF AVAILABLE EXPANSIONS AND I THINK IMPERIAL ASSAULT REALLY JUMPS AHEAD

NOT TO HATE ON MY SPACE HULK I DO WANT TO ADD THAT GW BLEW COMPONENT QUALITY OUT OF THE WATER ON THE GAME THE MINIATURES ARE EXCELLENT THE CARDBOARD THICK AS HELL AND THE FLUFF IN THE MANUALS ARE GREAT IT JUST REALLY NEEDS AN EXPANSION

BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT UNLESS YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE HUGE FANS I THINK YOU'LL GET MORE PLAY OUT OF IMPERIAL ASSAULT AND HAVE FUN
CHECK OUT LEVEL WHEN YOU HAVE THE CHANCE
SCYTHE IS A WORKER PLACEMENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT GAME MEMOIR IS A SKIRMISH YOU CAN THINK OF SPACE HULK AS A SCALED-DOWN MEMOIR IF YOU WISH IT HAS LITTLE IN COMMON WITH SPACE CRUSADE DREADNOUGHT EXCEPT THE BACKGROUND IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS A VERY SCALED-DOWN D D LIKE GAME AND EACH PLAYER ONLY CONTROLS ONE HERO EXCEPT FOR THE IMPERIAL PLAYER WHO ACTS AS A DM AND CONTROLS ALL IMPERIAL TROOPS MORE ROLEPLAYED AND A BIT LESS SKIRMISH WITH MORE SPACE FOR ALTERNATIVE ROUTES AND SO ON PLUS IT HAS A STORY UNFOLDING AS YOU PLAY
IMO SPACE MECHANICS REALLY SHOW THEIR AGE IA IS A MUCH MORE ENGAGING MODERN DESIGN
I PLAY BOTH QUITE A LOT
I PREFER IA AS A WHOLE IT'S A LOT MORE ENGAGING I THINK
NOPE IT'S UP TO THE FORENSIC INVESTIGATOR TO FIGURE OUT WHICH CLUE TILES TO USE FOR THE WEAPON AND WHICH TO USE FOR THE EVIDENCE AND UP TO THE OFFICERS TO FIGURE OUT WHICH CLUES ARE BEING GIVEN FOR EACH

TRY IT OUT IT'S NOT NEARLY AS DIFFICULT AS IT SEEMS WE'VE FOUND AFTER MANY MANY MANY PLAYS THAT THE GOOD GUYS WIN FAR MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
WHEN I EXPLAIN THIS GAME TO NEW PLAYERS I ALWAYS OMIT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WEAPONS EVIDENCE FOR THAT REASON THE MURDERER LEFT TWO PIECES OF EVIDENCE BEHIND ONE OF EACH COLOR THIS AVOIDS PLAYERS GETTING HUNG UP ON THE NON-EXISTENT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
STAR REALMS
DEAD LAST IS A RECENT GAME WITH A TRAITOR MECHANIC ON AMAZON NOW FOR EXACTLY BUCKINGHAMSHIRE BUT IT REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF PLAYERS

COUP SCALES WELL FROM 2 TO IT IS A GOOD GAME OF HIDDEN IDENTITIES

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF VAMPIRE ARE GOOD GAMES THAT WORK FROM PLAYERS GOOD AMOUNT OF BLUFFING AND HIDDEN IDENTITIES

AND THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THE CLASSIC RESISTANCE AVALON

EDIT FEW OTHER SUGGESTIONS BANG THE DICE GAME CITADELS MASCARADE

EDIT 2 FORMATTING
THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS BONANZA
BONANZA IS MY PICK TRADING
RED
EXPLODING KITTENS FOR THE CUTE CATS SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM IS ALSO FUN AND HAS BLUFFING BUT MIGHT BE ABOVE
CHEAP GAME WITH LITTLE TO NO SETUP SPYFAULT IS A GOOD ONE GOOD SOCIAL GAME WITH A ELEMENT CERTAINLY A FUN ONE TO HAVE AROUND AND GETS BETTER WITH A ROWDY CROWD
LOVE LETTER

WELCOME TO THE DUNGEON IS ONE OF MY RECENT FAVORITES IT'S EASY TO LEARN AND VERY FRIENDLY FOR GAMERS OF ALL EXPERIENCE LEVELS

GP AW D
BONANZA IS ON AMAZON
DP
BOARDGAME BONANZA
PLAYERS NO TINY PIECES

FOR SALE IS AWESOME FOR INTRODUCING TO TAKES LESS THAN MINUTES TO EXPLAIN AND FUN FOR ALL SKILL LEVELS
KITTY PAW OR CAT TOWER MAYBE
SMASH UP SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD FIT VERY LITTLE SETUP CLEANUP BASICALLY SETUP IS SHUFFLING TWO DECKS TOGETHER FOR EACH PLAYER AND SEPARATING OUT AT END DINOSAURS ALSO COME AS ONE OF THE FACTIONS IN THE BASE GAME PLUS IF SHE LATER BUYS THE PRETTY PRETTY SMASH UP EXPANSION SHE CAN PLAY AS YOU PLAY AS TWO FACTIONS MIXED TOGETHER IT ISN'T THE BEST PLAYER SCALING THOUGH BEST WITH OR PLAYERS ON AMAZON RIGHT NOW
CODENAMES
TIDES OF MADNESS
SOUNDS LIKE HAPPY SALMON WOULD BE A GOOD FIT LOOKS LIKE A KIDS GAME BUT IT'S GREAT FOR PARTIES

SALMON DP REF IE DTF QID SR KEYWORDS HAPPY SALMON
ROLL FOR IT
IT DOESN'T EXACTLY MATCH UP WITH YOUR FRIEND'S TASTES BUT CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THE CARD GAME IS A BIG GAME IN A SMALL BOX IT'S UNDER AS WELL MAYBE YOU CAN INTRODUCE A MORE EUROKY GAME TO YOUR FRIEND WITH THIS
I CAN RECOMMEND TWO GAMES THAT ARE GREAT WITH UP TO PLAYERS AND I HAVE PERSONALLY PLAYED CITADELS WHICH IS ABOUT ON AMAZON RIGHT NOW AND AVALON THE RESISTANCE WHICH IS JUST UNDER
CHECK OUT LOVE LETTER THE BATMAN THEME IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FLAVOR IT'S A REALLY FUN SHORT GAME IT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF PIECES CARDS AND SOME WOODEN TOKENS PLUS ITS NOT EXPENSIVE YOU COULD ALSO GET THE NEW DELUXE EDITION THAT PLAYED UP TO I BELIEVE WITH SOME NEW ROLES AND THE PACKAGING AND COMPONENTS ARE BEAUTIFUL THE DELUXE VERSION IS ABOUT
YOU COULD GET HIM CODENAMES PICTURES WHICH IS RIGHT AT THAT POINT OR MAYBE DICEMASTERS WOULD BE A GOOD FIT
FUJI FLUSH IS GOOD FOR HIGHER PLAYER COUNTS
NETRUNNER SUPPOSEDLY CORE WAS ON SALE FOR ON AMAZON
BIG FAN OF RUMMIKUB
LIKES CUTE CATS

SECONDING KITTY PAW FOR THIS
I WOULD CONSIDER HANAFI SPYFAULT OR CODENAMES
ARE THEY GOING TO BE PRIMARILY PLAYING BY THEMSELVES OR WITH OTHERS
I SECOND PUERTO RICO EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE IT IN THEIR COLLECTION
MY VOTE WOULD BE ABOVE AND BELOW AND PUERTO RICO
FROM THAT LIST ONLY ONE GAME REALLY STANDS OUT AS THE TRUE MASTERPIECE THAT HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME ONLY ONE GAME HAS BEEN AROUND OVER TEN YEARS WHILE THE REST ARE MUCH NEWER THAT GAME IS ALSO THE ONE I RECOMMEND PUERTO RICO

IF YOU MUST PICK ANOTHER ONE FROM THAT LIST MAYBE MYSTERIUM IT'S LIGHT ENOUGH THAT THEY'D BE ABLE TO PLAY IT WITH FRIENDS AND IT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM PRESENT

I WOULD PERSONALLY RECOMMEND AGRICOLA OR POWER GRID AS THE SECOND GAME

BUT THOSE ARE ALL GOOD GAMES NO DUDS
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PARTY TYPE GAMES I WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING INTO DIXIT TELESTRATIONS AND CODENAMES AS A GOOD PLACE TO START I HAVE FOUND THESE GAMES WORK FOR EVERY GROUP I HAVE TRIED THEM IN AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG HIT
MY BEST ADVICE WOULD BE TO SLOW DOWN ON THE BUYING AND TRY TO PLAY AS MANY GAMES AS YOU CAN YOU'LL GET RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ALL SORTS ON HERE SOME OF WHICH YOU'LL PROBABLY HATE SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO TRY TO WORK OUT WHAT SORTS OF THING YOU LIKE

ALSO NOT TO DISMISS YOUR PURCHASES BUT KOT AND BONY ARE VERY SIMILAR GAMES AND NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD EVER BELIEVE THAT BOTH ARE NEEDED IN A COLLECTION AND BUYING AN EXPANSION LET ALONE TWO BEFORE YOU'VE DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT YOU LIKE A GAME CAN BE A BIT DODGY FOR ALL THE PRAISE THAT IS HEAPED ON IT I'VE NEVER REALLY FELT ANY LOVE FOR CARCASSONNE OTHER THAN IT BEING A RATHER NICE FRENCH TOWN
I'M SOMEWHAT NEW TO THE HOBBY AS WELL I'VE FOUND PARTY GAMES ARE A GOOD WAY TO GET FRIENDS SORT OF INTO THE IDEA OF PLAYING WEREWOLF IS WHAT GOT ME INTERESTED AND IT WORKS FOR MOST OF MY FRIENDS AS WELL IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SOMETHING CO-OP BUT WITH A DECEPTION ASPECT INCORPORATED I REALLY ENJOYED DEAD OF WINTER
THIS DEPENDS A LOT ON THE SIZE OF YOUR GROUP ARE YOU
KING OF TOKYO REALLY NEEDS THE POWER UP EXPANSION TO MAKE IT INTERESTING I FOUNDATION
WONDERS IS PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD STARTER GAME RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO TEACH AND LEARN PLAYS PRETTY FAST AND SCALES WELL FROM TO PLAYERS
IF YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WELL SAY ANYTHING IS A GOOD PARTY GAME WITS WAGERS FOR A TRIVIA GAME THAT DOESN'T SUCK UP TITLE RECALL IF YOUR GROUP IS PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH POPULAR MUSIC TV MOVIES BOOKS ETC

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM IS A DICE TOWER ESSENTIALS GAME WHERE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BLUFF AND BARGAIN AND EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD TIME TRYING TO GET THEIR GOODS PAST THE SHERIFF AND INTO NOTTINGHAM

I HAVE TICKET TO RIDE AND WHILE IT'S GOOD I DON'T PLAY IT MUCH I'D RATHER PLAY ROYALS WHICH HAS A SIMILARISH MECHANIC WITH THE CARDS SET COLLECTION BUT IT'S AREA CONTROL EVERYONE WHO PLAYS IT WITH ME SEEMS TO LOVE IT WHETHER IT'S FRIENDS OR COMPLETE STRANGERS AT MY LOCAL GAME SHOP IT'S A DICE TOWER ESSENTIALS GAME TOO

FOR NIGHTS WHERE YOU HAVE PLAYERS THE RESISTANCE IS FANTASTIC TO HAVE ON HAND I PREFER PLAYING DECEPTION BUT DECEPTION GETS REALLY GOOD AT PLAYERS THOUGH TECHNICALLY DOES SUPPORT AS LOW AS PLAYERS

THERE ARE SO MANY YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT SOME OF THE DICE TOWER TOP VIDEOS TO FIND GAME IDEAS TO RESEARCH MORE PLAY WHAT YOU CAN BUY WHAT YOU LIKE
I'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS WITH SPYFAULT AS A PARTY GAME TAKES TWO SECONDS TO EXPLAIN AND GAME TIME IS AS LONG AS YOU WANT IT TO BE ONE DRAWBACK IS THE MORE PLAYERS YOU HAVE THE MORE USELESS THE LOCATION MAP BECOMES IT'S RELATIVELY IMPORTANT THAT EVERY PLAYER CAN VIEW IT TO DISCERN WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK THAT SAID IF YOU PLAY IT A FEW TIMES IN ONE GO EVERYONE DEVELOPS A GOOD FEEL FOR ALL THE LOCATIONS
WONDERS DUEL IS A FANTASTIC REDESIGN OF WONDERS SPECIFICALLY FOR TWO PLAYERS IT'S WORTH CHECKING OUT I KNOW THERE IS A 2 PLAYER VERSION OF CATAN BUT I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH IT
ONITAMA IS A GREAT GAME

WONDERS DUEL IS GREAT TABLA BUILDING GAME YOU TAKE TURNS CHOOSING CARDS BUILDING YOUR CIVILIZATION

CASTLES OF BURGUNDY IS ALSO A GREAT EURO FOR 2 PLAYERS
CARCASSONNE WAS THE GAME MY WIFE AND I FIRST STARTED PLAYING TOGETHER EVEN NOW IT IS ONE OF OUR MOST PLAYED
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THE DUKE IS INTERESTING

MY FAVOURITE COUPLES GAMES THOUGH ARE JAIPUR PATCHWORK SPLENDOR AND PANDEMIC
IN ESSEN WE DISCOVERED THE GAME EKE IT IS DESIGNED FOR PLAYERS WITH 2 PLAYERS IT IST VERY AND STRATEGIC AND WHEN WE PLAY IT WITH MORE THAN 2 PLAYER IN OUR PLAYGROUND THERE IS ALWAYS AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC THAT THE WEAKER PLAYERS UNITE AGAINST THE STRONGEST ONE
SOMEONE ALREADY SUGGESTED ONITAMA WHICH IS AMAZING SO I'LL MENTION ARUBA KAHUNA JAIPUR BATTLE LINE AND STAR REALMS
PATCHWORK FOR SURE
STAR REALMS
IT WOULD EASIER TO INCLUDE THE WHOLE GAME STATE IN A TABLE WITHIN THE EMAIL
I'M POTENTIALLY INTERESTED BUT AGREE WITH U MRABODI ABOUT IT BEING EASIER TO HAVE IT ALL DIGITAL I WONDER IF WE COULD HACK TOGETHER A QUICK INTERFACE I'M THINKING EVEN SOMETHING DECIDEDLY LIKE A GOOGLE DRAWING TO HANDLE THE THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME BECAUSE I BOUNCE BETWEEN WORK AND HOME AND COULD MAKE MOVES MORE OFTEN DURING THE DAY IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO CONSULT MY COPY AT HOME FOR EACH MOVE
HIT ME UP TOTALLY DOWN
SOB FEELS WAY MORE INTIMIDATING AND TO ME THAN GLOOMHAVEN GLOOMHAVEN IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF STUFF IN ONE BOX BUT A IT FEELS LIKE IT WILL REQUIRE A LOT LESS AND WORK TO SET UP AND PLAY THAN SOB AND B THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF WAYS TO PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT FEELING LOST OR LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE A GM GAMESMASTER

GLOOMHAVEN HAS FEWER MINIATURES NONE OF WHICH REQUIRE ASSEMBLY IN STARK CONTRAST TO SOB GLOOMHAVEN USES STANDEES FOR ALL MONSTERS WHICH ALLOWS FOR IT TO HIT THE TABLE MORE QUICKLY AND FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF MONSTER TYPES WITHOUT REQUIRING THAT YOU SHELL OUT CASH FOR EXPANSIONS AND MORE MINIS

GLOOMHAVEN DOESN'T USE DICE USES CARD DECKS OF ATTACK MODIFIERS INSTEAD WHICH ALLOWS FOR MORE TAILORING OF YOUR CHARACTER IN REGARDS TO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

LOTS OF REASONS WHY GLOOMHAVEN IS MORE PRACTICAL FOR ME AND WHY I'M MORE EXCITED ABOUT IT
MY VOTE WOULD BE GLOOMHAVEN PURELY BASED OFF MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE COMPANIES GLOOMHAVEN PUTS OUT UPDATES ALL THE TIME FLYING FROG WILL PRETEND YOU DON'T EXIST ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FF FOR THEM SCREWING UP THE LAST EXPANSION FOR LNOS MANUFACTURING ISSUES NOT GAMEPLAY WISE

MAYBE THEY'VE GOTTEN BETTER WHICH I DOUBT FROM READING SOB WHERE'S MY STUFF THREADS BUT I DON'T THINK I'D EVER TRUST THEM WITH A ON A PROMISE

MY COMPLAINING ASIDE SOB DOES LOOK INTERESTING TO ME BUT MY SO DOESN'T LIKE THE THEME SO PROBLEM SOLVED FOR ME
IS THERE ANY REASON WHY YOU WOULD LATE PLEDGE FOR GLOOMHAVEN INSTEAD OF JUST WAITING FOR IT TO HIT RETAIL I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW CAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN GLOOMHAVEN BUT FIGURED I WOULD JUST WAIT FOR IT TO BE RELEASED

ON ANOTHER NOTE SOB LOOKS GREAT BUT I'VE HEARD OF PROBLEMS WITH THERE PAST KICKSTARTERS AND APPARENTLY THERE ARE PEOPLE STILL WAITING FOR THEIR PLEDGE TO ARRIVE FROM THEIR LAST KICKSTARTER THE COMPANY DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE RECORD SO BACK AT YOUR OWN RISK I GUESS

ANOTHER OPTION TO CONSIDER IS SWORD SORCERY BY ARES GAMES SHOULD BE GETTING RELEASED VERY SOON MAYBE JANUARY OR FEBRUARY AND IS A LOT OF DUNGEON CRAWL PACKED INTO A BOX APPARENTLY IT FOLLOWS THE GALAXY DEFENDERS BATTLE SYSTEM NEVER PLAYED IT SO CAN'T COMMENT AND HAS A SOLO MODE WITH CHARACTERS THAT IMPROVE AND STUFF LAST I CHECKED THEY ARE STILL ACCEPTING LATE PLEDGES
THERE ARE TWO OTHER VERSIONS OF SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR GROUP KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER REPRINT KICKSTARTER LOOK IT UP

I GOT BOTH CORE SETS OF SOB ALMOST A YEAR AGO AND JUST PREPURCHASED GLOOMHAVEN A FEW MONTHS AGO TRUTH BE TOLD I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT GLOOMHAVEN AND I'M TRYING TO KEEP IT THAT WAY I LIKE THE DETAILS I KNOW AND WANT TO KEEP THE REST A SURPRISE

AS FAR AS SOB THOUGH IT IS A REALLY SOLID GAME I HAVE ONE CAMPAIGN RUNNING SOLO WHERE I'M PLAYING 2 CHARACTERS SIMULTANEOUSLY IT WORKS JUST FINE BUT I ALSO READ THE RULES COMPLETELY THROUGH TIMES AND PLAYED A BIT OF A MULTIPLAYER CAMPAIGN BEFORE LAUNCHING INTO IT SO I WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE GAME IT'S A LOT TO KEEP TRACK OF WITH JUST A SINGLE CHARACTER OBVIOUSLY RUNNING MULTIPLE BY YOURSELF DOUBLES THE EFFORT BUT THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T GET TO BE MUCH OF AN ISSUE UNTIL YOU GET A BIT MORE LEVELED UP AND HAVE A TON OF GEAR AND UPGRADES TO JUGGLE USING SOME CHARACTER SHEETS FROM BG HELPS

SO WHILE SOB IS A LOT TO KEEP TRACK OF I'D SAY IF YOU'RE USED TO RUNNING SOLITAIRE GAMES IT SHOULDN'T BE MUCH OF AN ISSUE AT LEAST NOT UNTIL YOU'RE REACHING END GAME

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PLAYING AS A SINGLE CHARACTER EVEN THOUGH THE GAME DOES ALLOW FOR IT
I'D VOTE SHADOWS JUST BECAUSE OF THE OBSCENE AMOUNT OF STUFF YOU GET FOR THE PRICE SOB IS A FANTASTIC GAME BUT I JUST STUMBLED ACROSS IT IN MY FAGS CUT TO A YEAR AND A BIT LATER I'VE SPENT DAMN NEAR A THOUSAND BUCKS FOR EXTRA ENEMIES AND EXTRAS THAT CAME WITH THE MINE CART PLEDGE OF THE ORIGINAL I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE OUT THAT MUCH SAVINGS IF YOU PUT OFF GLOOMHAVEN FOR MONTHS OR SO
IF AMERICAN GAMES LIKE SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE AND GLOOM HAVEN INTEREST YOU THE KICKSTARTER OF KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER MIGHT INTEREST YOU

THAT IS IF YOU DON'T MIND GETTING CREATIVE WITH PUTTING THE MINIS TOGETHER
BUYING DIXIT ODYSSEY IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST BET
ONLY WAY TO GET ONE IS TO MAKE YOUR OWN NOT REALLY A MARKET FOR ONE DUE TO THE FACT THAT INSERT THAT COMES WITH LATEST PRINTING OF DIXIT HOLDS BASE GAME PLUS EXPANSIONS WHICH IS ENOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE
I DON'T NORMALLY JUST DROP A TITLE AND RUN BUT EMET WOULD BE GOOD TWO TO BATTLE GAME ABOUT CONTROLLING AREAS OF THE BOARD DEVELOPING YOUR ARMIES POWERS IN UNIQUE WAYS AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPENINGS IN THE OTHER PLAYERS STRATEGIES
I DON'T SEE ANY DEXTERITY GAMES THERE PEOPLE SEEM TO REALLY LIKE FLICK EM UP AND RAMPAGE ALTHOUGH PITCH CAR LOOKS FAR MORE INTERESTING TO ME CROKINOLE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME THOUGH IF YOU WANT SOMETHING TIME TESTED AND AWESOME
SHAKESPEARE
ISTANBUL
SEASONS
BRUXELLES
TRAJAN
SUBURBIA

LEWIS CLARK
SPLENDOR
PORT ROYAL
MARGI

TICKET TO RIDE USA IS A GREAT ONE AND VERY SIMPLE TO PICK UP AND PLAY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
ABOVE AND BELOW HAS STORYTELLING ELEMENTS IN IT AND A FEW OTHER THINGS QUADROPOLIS IS ALSO FUN
A GOOD TACTICAL MINIATURES GAME WITH A CAMPAIGN WOULD BE A GOOD FIT I LOVE IMPERIAL ASSAULT OR DESCENT PEOPLE WILL SAY THE THEME IS THE ONLY CHANGE BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS ROOM FOR BOTH THE THEME MAKES IT FEEL DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO ME AT LEAST REGARDLESS THEY ARE BOTH AMAZING GAMES IF YOU CAN HAVE A GROUP AND PLAY WELL WITH TWO AS WELL
ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE DESCENT CODENAMES AND COUP
GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL AND ISTANBUL BOTH SOUND RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY AND ARE BOTH VERY SOLID GAMES BOTH IN MY TOP
LE HAVRE IS A FANTASTIC GAME WITH SIMPLE RULES YET COMPLEX DECISIONS IT IS ONE OF THE FEW GAMES I RATE A ON BG
YOU SEEM TO BE MISSING A BIT OF CLASSIC GROGNARD STYLED WARGAMES WERE TALKING HISTORICAL SIMULATION OF MILITARY CONFLICTS THERE ARE TOO MANY TO MENTION AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CHOICES BATTLES OF GETTYSBURG COMMAND AND COLORS ANCIENTS CHANDRAGUPTA GREAT BATTLES OF HISTORY AND SO ON ARE ALL POSSIBLE EXAMPLES HEAD OVER TO R WARGAMING OR R HEXANDCOUNTER IF YOU WANT TO ASK FOR A FIRST WARGAME

I RECOMMEND TRYING PRINT AND PLAY AND HEAD OVER TO WARGAMEVAULT THEN GRAB SOMETHING LIKE AGRICOLA MASTER OF BRITAIN AND MAKE A COPY YOURSELF PLUS MATERIELS OR GO TO HOLLANDSPIELE AND BUY A COPY PLUS SHIPPING
I'D TAKE A LOOK AT MYSTERIUM
SAMURAI SPIRIT DOES UP TO PLAYERS AND IS VERY SIMPLE TO PLAY THE RULEBOOK IS A NIGHTMARE TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH WATCH THE WATCH IT PLAYED ON YOUTUBE INSTEAD
YOU HAVE TO GO INTO ADVANCED OPTIONS BUT YOU CAN SEARCH A SPECIFIC MECHANIC AND PLAYER COUNT ON BG HERE YOU GO

ACTION SEARCH ADVSEARCH OBJECTTYPE BOARDGAME Q INCLUDE GEEKITEMNAME INCLUDE GEEKITEMNAME RANGE RANGE RANGE FLOATRANGE FLOATRANGE RANGE FLOATRANGE FLOATRANGE RANGE COLFILTERTYPE SEARCHUSER RANGE RANGE PLAYERRANGETYPE NORMAL RANGE RANGE PROPERTYIDS SUBMIT
I THINK I ONLY HAVE THAT GO UP TO PLAYERS

COMMISSIONED IS LIKE PANDEMIC BUT BASED ON THE NEW TESTAMENT

FLASH POINT FIRE RESCUE ALSO GOES UP TO

SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE CAN HANDLE BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S IDEAL

OTHERS YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN

MYSTERY OF THE ABBEY LIKE CLUE BUT NOT CO-OP

SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT CO-OP BUT IT HAS A HIDDEN TRAITOR

ESCAPE FROM ALIENS IN OUTER SPACE HIDDEN MOVEMENT AND SECRET TEAMS


SUSPICION IS SIMILAR TO CLUE MIGHT BE WORTH RESEARCHING PLAYS MAX
CODENAMES AND SPYFAULT BOTH SUPPORT PLAYERS AND ARE VERY BEGINNER FRIENDLY CAN BE A PARTY TYPE GAME FOR SURE IF YOU LIKE SCI-FI COSMIC ENCOUNTER WITH AN EXPANSION CAN SUPPORT PLAY WITH GREEN ALIENS UNTIL PEOPLE GET IT COSMIC IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE GAME OVERALL

ALSO WHAT WOULD BE SCARY BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL IS A CAMPY HORROR MOVIE PRETTY SELF AWARE GAME BUT SOME PARTS WOULD BE SCARY FOR SOME PEOPLE I THINK DEPENDING ON THE PEOPLE I PERSONALLY FIND IT LIKE A GAME WHERE YOU PLAY AS THE CAST OF BUT IT IS LIKE CABIN IN THE WOODS AT THE SAME TIME IF IT SOUNDS INTERESTING I CAN GIVE SOME SPOILER FREE OVERVIEW
CASTLE PANIC IS A LIGHT COOP ALSO AVAILABLE WITH A STAR TREK THEME THEY MAY FIND IT TOO SIMPLE WHEN COMPARED TO PANDEMIC

ELDER SIGN SET IN H PAGE HOVERCRAFT LORE MIGHT WORK FOR YOUR GROUP BUT GAME WILL RUN PAST THE HOUR MARK


I KNOW A LOT OF NEWCOMERS WHO'VE ENJOYED PLAYING AVALON OR SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM A LOT THEY ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PLAYERS ARE IN FOCUS INSTEAD OF GAME RULES
SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE
CHECK OUT TABLETOP FROM GEEK AND SUNDRY ON YOUTUBE WIL WHEATON PLAYS A BUNCH OF BOARD GAMES WITH RANDOM FOLKS YOU WILL PRETTY MUCH BE ABLE TO TELL BY THE LENGTH OF THE VIDEO HOW LONG THE GAMES LAST AND HE GIVES A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EACH GAME AT THE BEGINNING
DELETED
MAYBE JUST STOP MESSING WITH YOUR WISELIEST RIGHT AFTER THE LARGEST SHOPPING DAY IN THE YEAR

PRETTY SURE IT'S SET UP THAT WAY TO PREVENT YOU FROM DUPLICATE PURCHASES AND BY DEFAULT ONLY SHOWS YOU THE WARNING IF THEY THINK YOU'RE GOING TO PURCHASE IT

SO IF BY TRYING TO SHARE THE LINK THE ITEM WAS IN YOUR CART OR YOU ADD TO YOUR WISELIEST THAT WAY COULD VERY WELL OF HAPPENED


I STOPPED USING AMAZON WISELIEST FOR BOARD GAMES BECAUSE OF SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS MY FIANCE USED MY PRIME ACCOUNT TO PURCHASE CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG AS A SURPRISE ONCE SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS GOING TO SURPRISE ME WITH A BOARD GAME SO I KEPT AWAY FROM CHECKING MY ORDER AND WHAT NOT TO MAINTAIN THE SURPRISE HOWEVER IT REMOVED MAD KING LUDWIG FROM MY WISH LIST IT MAKES SENSE WHY IT WOULD DO THIS BUT I DIDN'T GIVE IT ANY THOUGHT BEFORE LOOKING THROUGH THE WISELIEST AND SUBSEQUENTLY NOTICING IT WAS MISSING I USE NOTES OR A LIST APP CALLED WUNDERLIST THAT I SHARE WITH PEOPLE NOW INSTEAD
I CAN CHECK MY COPY WHEN I GET HOME IF YOU DON'T HEAR FROM ME IN A COUPLE DAYS SEND ME A PM TO REMIND ME

FUN GAME
ALSO HERE'S AN ONLINE WEB APP THAT SIMULATES THE AUTOMA CARDS WHILE YOUR WAITING FOR YOUR CARDS


THERE WAS A RECENT THREAD ABOUT THIS

R BOARDGAMES COMMENTS REF ST IVZTWIJN SH
SINCE THERE IS ALMOST NO INFORMATION ABOUT THIS GAME I'M GOING TO ASME YOU ARE THE CREATOR OF TH GAME CAN YOU TALK MORE ABOUT HOW IT PLAYS READING THE DESCRIPTION IN BG IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE A REAL MESS WHAT WITH TRYING TO COOPERATE BUT WITHOUT TALKING MAKING NOISE OR GIVING ANY VISUAL CLUES TO EACH OTHER
I ONCE HAD A GAME WHERE WE WERE ON A SPACE STATION ONE GUY WAS ACTING KIND OF SUSPICIOUS SO WE ASKED HIM HOW MUCH EDUCATION DID YOU NEED TO GET HERE AND HE CLAIMED NOT MUCH WE THOUGHT HE WAS NAILED FOR SURE BUT THEN HE STARTED ANSWERING SPOT ON

WHERE DO YOU LIVE
HERE OBVIOUSLY

HOW OFTEN DO YOU GO BACK HOME
ITS BEEN A FEW MONTHS WE ARE KIND OF ISOLATED

DO YOU GET OUT OFTEN
NOT REALLY IT'S KIND OF DANGEROUS

MEANWHILE HE WAS ASKING US REALLY WEIRD THINGS LIKE OUR FAVORITE FRUIT FAVORITE BIRD HOW WE FEEL ABOUT THE GUYS IN CHARGE

WE EVENTUALLY JUST ACCUSED HIM AND HE WAS SHOCKED HE PROUDLY DISPLAYED HIS CARD SHOWING HE WAS NOT A SPY HE WAS ON A PIRATE SHIP WE SCREWED UP THE DECK AND PIRATE SHIPS ARE SHOCKINGLY LIKE SPACE SHIPS BEEN ON THE FIREFLY
I WAS THE SPY ONCE AND THE LOCATION WAS THE SPACE STATION MY FRIEND STARTS IT OFF AND JUST ASKS ME THE WEATHER A LITTLE RAINY
I ONCE ADDED A 3RD CEYLON CARD IN A PLAYER GAME OF BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE STILL FAILING THE CRISIS CARDS WHEN ONE CEYLON HAD REVEALED AND THE OTHER WAS IN THE BRIG

NEEDLESS TO SAY WE LOST BUT ONLY JUST
MY FAVORITE WAS WHEN WE FINISHED A ROUND AND ONE PLAYER GOES TO THE BATHROOM THE DEALER PULLS OUT THE SPY CARD AND DEALS IT TO THEM THEN THE REST OF US JUST ASK ARBITRARY BULLSHIT QUESTIONS THE ENTIRE TIME
HALACHA WHAT WERE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
I BELIEVE THIS IS AN ACTUAL VARIANT ON BOARDGAMEGEEK I'D LIKE TO TRY IT SOMETIME BUT SPYFAULT DOESN'T GET TO THE TABLE OFTEN ENOUGH FOR IT TO HAPPEN ACCIDENTALLY
YEAH WE HAVE THIS AS ONE OF OUR BAGS ON PURPOSE WE LOVE WHEN IT COMES OUT
A FRIEND DID THIS TO US PLAYING A FAKE ARTIST GOES TO NEW YORK WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WE ENDED UP DRAWING A VERY INTERESTING AND CONFUSED PICTURE GREAT GAME IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BTW
WE PLAYED AND ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS WAS HOW MANY TICKETS DID YOU SELL IT BECAME QUITE MEMORABLE BECAUSE THE PERSON ANSWERING WAS WORKING COAT CHECK AND THUS GAVE AWAY TICKETS BUT DIDN'T SELL THEM

WELL NEXT ROUND AND EVERY ROUND THAT FOLLOWED THAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION IT STRAIGHT UP REVEALED A SPY THAT TRIED TO SAY THEY WERE SELLING LOADS OF TICKETS TO THE SPACE STATION
WE DID THIS INTENTIONALLY ONCE ONLY THE ORGANIZER KNEW WE FOUND THAT EVERYONE WAS QUITE QUICK TO COME UP WITH A QUESTION EACH OF WHICH WAS VERY VAGUE THE ANSWERS WERE ALSO FAST AND GENERIC
THAT SOUNDS HILARIOUS THANKS FOR SHARING
WE HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN AND ALSO MADE A SPY BAG GREAT GREAT FUN
I'VE PLAYED SOME ROUNDS LIKE THIS BEFORE IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO THROW IN A ROUND OF ON PURPOSE AND SEE WHERE IT GOES
MY BEST SPYFAULT GAME WAS WHEN I HAD BEEN THE SPY FOR GAMES IN A ROW ON THE 6TH GAME WHEN I WAS THE SPY AGAIN I COULDN'T TAKE IT BEFORE WE EVEN STARTED I SAID I'M THE SPY AND WE'RE ON THE SUBMARINE WE WERE ON THE SUBMARINE IT WAS THE BEST
IT'S SUCH AN AWESOME GAME AND THE ONLY ONE I'VE EVER PLAYED WHICH IS ENJOYED TO THE SAME EXTENT BY CASUAL AND SEASONED GAMERS ALIKE
SUCH A FUN GAME ONCE EVERYONE GETS THE HANG OF IT MY YOUNGEST SISTER IS SO GOOD AT BEING THE SPY THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE GAMES WHERE WE WERE CONVINCED NOBODY ACTUALLY GOT THE SPY CARD
WE PLAYED IT AS WELL MINUTES WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO ASK A QUESTION I'M STARING AT THE TIMER TICK DOWN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO ASK

THEN WE PUT IT AWAY AND PLAYED INSTEAD
MY FRIENDS AND I PLAYED A GAME OF WEREWOLF WHERE THE CARD WASN'T INITIALLY DEALT OUT BUT REPLACED BY THE DM LATER GOOD TIMES WERE HAD
I HAVE ONLY PLAYED THE MOBILE VERSION AND IN ONE OF OUR FIRST GAMES WE ENDED UP SOMEHOW WITH LIKE SPIES AND EVERYONE WAS JUST REALLY CONFUSED SUCH A FUN ROUND THO

EDIT AH THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER ROUND WHERE I THERE WAS SPY AND 2 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR SOME REASON I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE 2ND LOCATION SO EVERYTHING I SAID LED THEM TO BELIEVE I WAS A SPY SUCH A FUN ROUND
GOOD TIMES
DID YOU BUY ADDITIONAL SPY CARDS TO DO THIS
I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS AN ACTUAL BOARD GAME I'VE ONLY PLAYED THE DIGITAL VERSION COOL
THIS REMINDS ME OF AN AMAZING LAUGH WE HAD ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES PLAYING SECRET HITLER WHEN WHEN THE HITLER CARD DIDN'T GET ADDED TO THE PILE AND WE JUST HAD A TEAM OF FASCISTS
ONE TIME I INTENTIONALLY REMOVED THE SPY AND JUST WATCHED AND LAUGHED AS EVERYONE ELSE GOT PROGRESSIVELY MORE AND MORE CONFUSED THAT EVERYONE ELSE SEEMED TO BE LEGIT
IS THERE SAND

I MEAN IF YOU BROUGHT SAND
I OCCASIONALLY TROLL PEOPLE IN SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES SO I'LL HAVE TO TRY THIS ONE NEXT TIME
I FEEL LIKE THAT SHOULD JUST BE ONE OF THE BAGGIES BY DEFAULT JUST TO THROW PEOPLE FOR A LOOP
WELL IF YOU'RE DOWN FOR A BIT OF A DRIVE THERE'S COMICS AND GAMES OFF AND SHEPHERD THIS WOULD BE GOING TOWARDS DOWNTOWN HOUSTON THOUGH THERE'S ALSO ASGARD GAMES WHICH SELLS MOSTLY MINIATURE GAMES BUT IS A COOL SPOT
NOT REALLY I LIVE HERE AND I ORDER STUFF THERE WILL BE A DRAGON'S LAIR OPENING ON THE NORTH SIDE SOON THOUGH
I SEE YOU POINT BEEN FRUSTRATED AT THIS AS WELL HOWEVER LET ME POINT OUT A FEW THINGS TO HELP TEMPER PATIENCE

YOU MENTION THEY ARE GAMERS I'M UNSURE IF YOU MEAN THEY ARE GAMERS VIDEO ARCADE OR THEY JUST AREN'T GAMERS PERIOD PROVIDED BY THE CONTEXT OF YOUR WORDS I PRESUME YOU MEAN THEY DON'T PLAY BOARD GAMES DOES IT SURPRISE YOU THAT FOLKS WHO PLAY VIDEO GAMES LIKE THEIR TECHNOLOGY IT DOESN'T TO ME

WHAT IF THEY WEREN'T GAMERS PERIOD OUR SOCIETY VIEWS THAT SMARTPHONE AS AN EXTENSION OF THEIR BODY IN AN ERA OF FACETIAE TEXT MESSAGES AND SOCIAL MEDIA ALERTS BEING PUSHED TO OUR FINGERS THROUGH THE PHONE IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THEY ARE DISTRACTED

THE CHALLENGE NOW IS HOW TO OVERCOME THIS HOW DO WE CAPTIVATE THEIR INTEREST AND ATTENTION I HAVE TO ASK WHAT GAMES WERE YOU PLAYING WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THEM HOW WERE PEOPLE RESPONDING TO THEM

I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU'RE A BAD GAME HOST BUT THAT JOB IS A TOUGH ONE PARTIALLY ON EVALUATING WHAT YOUR AUDIENCE LIKES PARTIALLY FOR THE TITLES YOU OWN OR HAVE ACCESS TO AND PARTIALLY ON THE TIME AND ENVIRONMENT TO NOTE I USED TO MANAGE S SOUTHEAST REGION'S VOLUNTEERS I'M USED TO TEACHING THESE GUYS HOW TO DO A COMPELLING PLAYTHROUGH OR DEMO

ANYHOW MY THOUGHTS KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE WELL IF YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD THEIR ATTENTION FOR MINUTES IN A GAME WITH GAMERS I'D THINK TWICE ADULT ATTENTION SPANS ARE SHORT WITH RULES EXPLANATION SIMPLE IS KING KEEP IT SHORT AND TO THE POINT DON'T LOSE THEM HERE AS YOU BOG THEM DOWN WITH MINUTES OF RULES

WHEN I RUN EVENTS OR AT HOLIDAY GATHERINGS I START WITH THE FILLER MY GO TO FILLERS INCLUDE REAL TIME AND HANDS ON GAMES I REALLY LIKE ESCAPE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE BECAUSE IT'S QUICK TO LEARN IT'S MINUTES OF CONSTANT AND ACTIVE GAMING MOST GROUPS WANT TO PLAY AGAIN AFTER TH FIRST GAME YOU WANT A HOOK TO BARB THEM A MINUTE RULES EXPLANATION AND MINUTES OF REAL TIME GAMING HELPS THEM FORGET ABOUT THE PHONE

SECOND I PULL OUT A DEXTERITY GAME WITH LITTLE DOWN TIME LATELY THAT'S BEEN JUNK ARTICLE I WOULD MODIFY THE GAME TO PLAY SOMETHING LIKE MONTREAL INDIANAPOLIS OR MONACO THIS REDUCES DOWN TIME AND KEEP PIECES IN THEIR HANDS PLUS IT'S REALLY FUN A FEW CITIES WOULD EAT UP MINUTES OF TIME BY NOW THEY HAVEN'T PLAYED WITH THEIR PHONES CALL FOR A BREAK REFRESH BEVERAGES CHECK YOUR FACEBOOK ETC TELL THEM WHEN YOU COME BACK YOU'LL NEED THEIR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION

PICK A THIRD GAME I WOULD NOT SUGGEST ANYTHING WITH DOWN TIME DOWN TIME INVITES THE PHONES I WOULD THINK OF SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES CONSTANT INTERACTION SOCIAL DEDUCTION ARE GOOD FOR THIS SOME PARTY GAMES ARE GOOD FOR THIS COOPERATIVE ARE GOOD FOR THIS I WOULD AVOID GAMES WITH LONG TURNS MANY OF MY FAVORITE EUROS TAKE MINUTES TO GO AROUND THE TABLE USE YOUR DISCRETION WITH THE GROUP WHAT IS IT THAT THEY ARE INTO CAN I FIND SOMETHING TO LINK HERE I'D TRY TO KEEP IT UNDER AN HOUR BUT THAT'S YOUR CALL

AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE HAD 2 MINUTE GAME SESSIONS AND MINUTE SESSION PEOPLE MAY BE SPENT BOOZE TURKEY GETTING SLEEPY ETC I'D SCALE DOWN TO ANOTHER FILLER IF THE GROUP IS READY TO CALL IT I WOULD SUGGEST QWIXX OR ROLLING AMERICA SMALL BOX EASY TO TEACH LEARN IF THEY ARE PRIMED FOR MORE PREPARE ANOTHER GAME OR PLAY THE LAST ONE AGAIN BUT CHANGE IT UP A LITTLE NOT BY ADDING AN EXPANSION

MANY FOLKS LIKE THE IDEA OF BOARD GAMING AS THE EVENT'S GM YOU HAVE AN IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP THEM ENGAGED AND HAVING A GREAT TIME SOME FORETHOUGHT REALLY MAKES THIS EASIER BEATING PEOPLE'S ATTENTION SPAN IS THE TOUGHEST THING FIND WAYS TO HAVE THEM MOVING KEEPING THEIR HANDS BUSY AND LAUGHING WHILE DOING SO MEANS HAVE MORE SUCCESSFUL GAMING SESSIONS

BEST OF LUCK
THIS IS STARTLINGLY TRUE BUT NOT ALL NON GAMERS FORTUNATELY SUFFER FROM THIS PROBLEM IT REALLY COMES INTO LIGHT DURING TABLETOP WHEN PEOPLE JUST PICK UP PHONES OUT OF HABIT

BUT DOWN WITH THE CELL PHONES AT THE TABLE SERIOUSLY
NO PHONES AT THE TABLE RULE BE POLITE TO YOUR FELLOW GAMERS AND GIVE THE GAME YOUR ATTENTION
IT'S NOT JUST ONE OF MY CLOSE FRIENDS WHO PLAYS AND BUYS THE MOST GAMES OF ALL OF US LITERALLY NEVER PUTS DOWN HIS PHONE DURING GAMES UNLESS IT'S SOMETHING WHERE IT'S COMPLETELY UNAVOIDABLE LIKE BONANZA OR THE RESISTANCE OR SOMETHING PRETTY MUCH ALL OF MY FRIENDS GAME WITH THEIR PHONES AT THE READY ACTUALLY BUT THIS PARTICULAR FRIEND STANDS OUT IN HIS UTTER RELIABILITY TO BE ON HIS PHONE IT'S PRETTY DAMN ANNOYING TO BE HONEST HE'S GENERALLY PRETTY GOOD ABOUT KEEPING AN EYE ON THE GAME SO THAT HE'S NOT CAUGHT UNAWARES WHEN IT'S HIS TURN AND HE GENERALLY TAKES HIS TURNS QUICKLY BUT THE FACT THAT HE'S ON HIS PHONE ALL THE TIME MEANS HE DOESN'T REALLY PARTICIPATE IN OR INITIATE MUCH TABLE TALK MAKES IT HARD TO FEEL LIKE THE GAMING IS A SOCIAL EXPERIENCE

I'M SUPER MYSELF IN MY DAILY LIFE BUT I MAKE A VERY DELIBERATE EFFORT TO KEEP MY PHONE OFF THE TABLE DURING GAMES WHILE I HOPE I WOULD HAVE DEVELOPED THAT HABIT ANYWAY OUT OF COURTESY I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS I'VE BECOME DISCIPLINED WITH REGARDS TO PHONES IS JUST A PRACTICAL THING WHEN I FIRST STARTED WITH BOARD GAMES I WAS THE ONE THAT INTRODUCED ALMOST EVERYBODY IN MY GROUP TO GAMES IN GENERAL AND ALSO TAUGHT ALL THE RULES FOR NEW GAMES IF I WASN'T ENTHUSIASTIC AND FOCUSED I COULDN'T EXPECT A TABLE FULL OF NEW GAMERS TO BE EITHER AND I ALSO WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CATCH RULES MISTAKES OR GIVE GUIDANCE WHEN THEY OVERLOOKED SOMETHING I DON'T REALLY TAKE THAT ROLE VERY OFTEN ANYMORE AS ALL OF MY FRIENDS ARE SEASONED GAMERS NOW BUT THE ATTITUDE STUCK
IF I HAVE TO BRING OUT THE PHONE IT'S BECAUSE THE GAME HAS TOO MUCH DOWNTIME
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE WHO PREVIOUSLY WERE HEAVY INTO VIDEOGAMES HAVE AN EASY TIME TO GET INTO BOARDGAMES AS LONG AS THE COMPETITIVE ASPECT IS RETAINED FOR FAMILY MEMBERS YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OFF NOT PLAYING THE OVERLY COMPLEX AND NERDY BOARDGAMES SINCE THEY WOULD TEND TO JUST FLAT OUT REJECT THE GAME AS SOON AS A SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT RULE OR CONCEPT APPEARS THOUGH I CAN'T SPEAK FOR YOUR FAMILY IF ATTENTION SPAN IS A PROBLEM CONSIDER PLAYING SHORTER GAMES BUT PLAY THEM SEVERAL TIMES
I THINK YOU'D ENJOY THESE TRUE CLASSICS

POWER GRID AN ECONOMIC GAME WITH AUCTION ELEMENTS COMPETE WITH OTHER PLAYERS TO ELECTRIFY THE MOST NUMBER OF CITIES VERY STRATEGIC AS YOU'LL NEED TO AND YOUR OPPONENTS FOR THE BEST ROUTES AND RESOURCES CONSIDER BUYING THE DELUXE EDITION

PUERTO RICO A ROLE SELECTION GAME WHERE YOU COMPETE WITH OTHER PLAYERS ON THE GAME BOARD WHILE OPTIMIZING YOUR OWN PLAYER BOARD WITH PLANTATIONS AND STRUCTURES THAT WILL HELP YOU ACHIEVE VICTORY VERY STRATEGIC AND VERY FUN

AGRICOLA IS ALSO A GREAT SUGGESTION THAT HAS BEEN MADE ALREADY
BROOM SERVICE ACQUIRE TRAGEDY LOOPER STRATEGIC GAMES WITH A BOARD THAT WILL STILL SEE A LOT OF DIRECT PLAYER INTERACTION

SCYTHE BRASS ALCHEMISTS HEAVIER STRATEGY GAMES REQUIRES PLANNING THESE ARE MORE INTENSE AND IN GENERAL ARE MORE HEADS DOWN NOT MULTIPLAYER SOLITAIRE BUT YOU'LL SPEND MORE TIME THINKING THAN MAKING YOUR OPPONENTS LIVES DIFFICULT
EMET OR CYCLADES


THE THEME IS SPOT ON BUILD A FARM IT HAS CARDS THAT ADD NEEDED VARIABILITY BUT YOU ONLY EVER DRAW AND THE STRATEGY COMES FROM MANAGING SCARCITY SCARCITY OF TIME FOOD AND RESOURCES

AND YOUR OPPONENTS CAN BLOCK YOUR PLANS SINCE IT IS A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME

I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT IN A BIG GROUP BUT ALLOW MINUTES PER PLAYER
FORBIDDEN STARS IS FABULOUS A REALLY FUN GAME OF CAPTURE THE FLAG IN SPACE
BROOM SERVICE COVERT QUADROPOLIS TOBAGO VITICULTURE
YOU SHUFFLE ALL THE TERROR CARDS TOGETHER EXCEPT FOR ABDUCTOR SPECIFIC CARDS THESE ARE REMOVED UNLESS PLAYING WITH THE SPECIFIC ABDUCTOR PICTURED ON THE CARD CARDS FROM EACH ABDUCTOR PACK CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY AN ICON IN THE CORNER OF THE CARD

I PULLED ALL THIS INFO FROM HERE SORRY IF I GOT ANYTHING WRONG I ONLY HAVE THE BASE SET LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO SEPARATE THEM BY ICON AND LOOK UP THE INDIVIDUAL PACKS FOR RULES
WATCH V I USED THIS GUY RICKY ROYAL TO LEARN MAGE KNIGHT HERE'S THE LINK TO HIS HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR VIDEO DOES A GOOD JOB SETTING UP AND EXPLAINING THINGS
THAT SEEMS A BIT LIKE A WASTE OF MONEY TO ME BUT I GUESS YOU'RE MORE OF A COLLECTOR THEN

I THINK YOU MIGHT BE DEAD OF WINTER BOARD GAME GEEK PROMOS IN YOUR LIST
TRY THIS

GEEKIEST ITEM
SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT THE GAME BUT THEY DO SOME FUNNY STUFF
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE SECONDS PER DOLLAR HAS BEEN GOING CONSISTENTLY DOWN EARLIER TODAY A DOLLAR BOUGHT YOU MORE THAN 2 SECONDS NOW IT BUYS YOU
FOR HOURS OF DIGGING I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE HOLE WOULD BE LARGER
MAYBE THEY'LL FIND JIMMY HOFFA
NOT AS FUNNY AS THE BULLSHIT BUT I STILL LIKE IT
WHAT KIND OF HOLE IN THE GROUND
I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK
THE MONEY THEY MAKE CERTAINLY DOESN'T GO TO HELP THEM SIT A HOLE MAYBE SOME OF IT THE REST OF IT IS PROFIT COURTESY OF MORONS WHO WASTE THEIR MONEY ON GARBAGE LIKE THAT
THEY START SHIPPING ORDERS NOV
I HAVEN'T PLAYED FLIP IT BUT GAMES MY SO AND I REACH FOR WHEN WE WANT A QUICK LIGHT GAME ARE STAR REALMS GALAXY TRUCKER CURRENT FAVOURITE HANAFI FLASH POINT FIRE RESCUE AND SUSHI GO
I HAVEN'T PLAYED FLIP BUT GAMES MY WIFE AND I REACH FOR WHEN WE WANT A QUICK LIGHT GAME ARE DRAGONHOOD ASCENSION BEYOND BAKER STREET PATCHWORK JAIPUR AND MOUSE GUARD SWORDS STRONGHOLDS
SEVEN WONDERS DUEL IS NOT COMPLEX IF YOU DON'T OVER THINK IT AND CAN BE PLAYED FAIRLY QUICKLY THE MORE YOU PLAY THE MORE YOU WILL DISCOVER THE DEPTH OF VARIABILITY AND HOW DEEP A GAME IT WILL BECOME
HOLMES SHERLOCK MELCROFT

2 PLAYER ONLY BUT I'M A FAN
THINK ABOUT THE CARDS WITH COFFEE CUP SYMBOLS DO AND WHAT EACH OF THEM DO AND I THINK YOU'LL ANSWER YOUR OWN QUESTION

SPOILER S RED COFFEE CUP CARDS STEAL COINS FROM OTHER PLAYERS ALL GAME LONG THIS IS PAYBACK

KEEP IN MIND PLAYERS ARE LIMITED TO ONE EACH OF THE MAJOR ESTABLISHMENTS
UNBALANCED CARDS AND SUBPAR GAMEPLAY WELCOME TO MACHI BORO
MACHI BORO IS GIANT UNBALANCED THINGS APPLIED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER YOU'RE NOT MISINTERPRETING IT THE GAME IS JUST THAT SWINGY
SPACE HULK
OR IMPERIAL ASSAULT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTIONS
PREPRINTED OR YOU PAINT IT SINGLE PIECE OR ASSEMBLY REQUIRED WHAT ABOUT MINIATURES APPEALS TO YOU GOT ANY FRIENDS THAT PLAY ALREADY
COOPERATIVE OR COMPETITIVE BATTLES OR DUNGEON CRAWLING OR OTHER
MY VOTES GO TO ZOMBICIDE WHICH IS A CO-OP ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GAME AND SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT A CO-OP KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE GAME
SPACE HULK OR
ARENA OF THE PLANESWALKERS IS A FAIRLY LIGHT TACTICAL MINIATURES GAME BUT IS VERY CHEAP TO PICK UP
MINIATURE WARGAMING LIKE INFINITY OR GATES OF ANTARES
CLAUSTROPHOBIA IS REALLY COOL IT WAS ON SALE THROUGH ASMODEUS RECENTLY THE FFA SALE FOR BUCKINGHAMSHIRE
I REALLY LIKE FIRESTORM ARMADA THE MOVEMENT RULES CAN MAKE IT TAKE LONGER BUT I REALLY ENJOY HOW IT WORKS
CONAN
SPACE CADETS AWAY MISSIONS

MINIATURES QUICK SET UP EASY BUT NOT TOO LIGHT RULES ONE OF MY FAVORITES
BECAUSE A VERY LIMITED NUMBER PEOPLE HAVE PLAYED IT YET AND FEWER AT THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE UPDATED EVEN IF IT'S HIGHLY RATED IT DOESN'T HAVE A BIG PLAYER BASE TO GIVE THOSE WEIGHT
IT'S A GREAT GAME IT'S NOT WITHOUT ITS FAULTS BUT YEAH I THINK IT COULD POSSIBLY MAKE IT ONTO THE REDDIN TOP IT NEEDS MORE TIME HOWEVER NOT EVERYONE ON REDDIN HAS PLAYED IT AND NOT EVERYONE HERE RATES THEIR GAMES ON BG AND THAT SIDEBAR IS ONLY UPDATED OCCASIONALLY
SORRY BUT THIS DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL

NOT ONLY WAS IT A LIMITED PRINT RUN BUT ALSO HAVING PLAYED IT IT'S A VERY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE

THE CARDS YOU PLAY ONLY SYNERGIES IN VERY LIMITED WAYS SO YOU DON'T REALLY GET A CHANCE TO BUILD TOWARDS ANY MEANINGFUL ENGINE I DIDN'T FEEL THERE WAS MUCH MEANINGFUL INTERACTION BETWEEN THE PLAYERS SO THE DOWNTIME FELT LENGTHY THE DECISIONS WERE NEVER PARTICULARLY MEANINGFUL YOU EITHER DID A THING OR DID A LESS GOOD THING THE PLAY TIME WAS LONG BUT SHALLOW

IT'S NOT THE WORST GAME I'VE PLAYED BUT IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THE HIGHEST HYPE TO DISAPPOINTMENT RATIOS I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE
DELETED
SCOVILLE IS A GAME ABOUT PLANTING BREEDING PICKING AND SELLING PEPPERS
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED AGRICOLA OR ANY OF ITS VARIATIONS LIKE THE FAMILY EDITION OR SUCH I LIKE IT MORE AS A AGRICULTURAL GAME THAN VITICULTURE AND I THINK IT HAS MORE DEPTH AND BREADTH ITS WELL LIKED TOO AMONG THE WIDE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE I SHOW IT TOO

THAT DEPENDS IF HE HASNT ALREADY PLAYED OR IF ITS HARD FOR HIM THINK ABOUT IT AND LOOK INTO THE FAMILY VERSION TOO
HERBACEOUS WOULD FIT BUT IT'S NOT OUT UNTIL SPRING MAYBE FOR NEXT YEAR

U GETINFO
ARBORETUM IS A WONDERFULLY CHINKY CARD GAME ABOUT PLANTING TREES

AGRICOLA IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL MEDIEVAL FARMING GAME

OTHER GAMES THAT HAVE FARMING ELEMENTS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ARE SCYTHE AND CASTLES OF BURGUNDY
HOW MANY PEOPLE SHOULD IT BE FOR IF EXCLUSIVELY 2 PLAYER IS FINE THE KING OF CUTE SIMPLE ANIMAL HUSBANDRY GAMES IS AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES BIG AND SMALL
MI SIERRA NEW ERA
VITICULTURE IS GREAT BUT IF YOU WOULD RATHER STAY AWAY FROM DON'T GET IT DON'T GET AGRICOLA OR FIELDS OF ARLE EITHER

AS FOR OTHER OPTIONS WHAT ABOUT LOTUS OR POSSIBLY COTTAGE GARDEN I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT
FIELDS OF ARLE IS A 2 PLAYER GAME THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO I GOT IT AS A GIFT AND HAVE BEEN WAITING TO PLAY IT BUT FROM ALL THE VIDEOS AND RULES REVIEW I HAVE DONE IT SEEMS LIKE A GREAT GAME
AT THE GATES OF LOYANG IT HAS FARMING THEME ITS MULTIPLAYER SOLITAIRE WITH STRONG EMPHASIS ON OPTIMIZATION
LOTUS PERHAPS
GOOD WORK WITH THE LIST YOU HAVE SOME REALLY SOLID SUGGESTIONS IN THERE
THIS IS GREAT I ALSO FOUND OF STARS HOLLOW IT'S A SMASHUP OF GILMORE GIRLS AND WEREWOLVES MAFIA AND WE HAVEN'T STOPPED PLAYING ALL WEEKEND CHECK IT OUT HERE


I FEEL LIKE TIDES OF TIME AND ITS LOVECRAFTIAN SEQUEL TIDES OF MADNESS WOULD BE GREAT ADDITIONS TO THE LIST ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY'RE BOTH SMALL AND INEXPENSIVE PERFECT FOR STOCKING STUFFERS
HAHA WOW I TOTALLY BACKED MULTIUNIVERSUM AND DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS SO SMALL NICE ALSO COUP SHOULD FIT RIGHT I BELIEVE IT'S CLOSE IN SIZE TO THE RESISTANCE I WAS THINKING OF BUYING IT AS A FOR A FRIEND ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BIGGER STOCKINGS TOO
WOW THAT'S A REALLY GREAT LIST

I GRABBED ZOMBIE DICE FOR THING AGE AND DRAGONHOOD FOR THING 2 AGE DIDN'T SEE THEM ON YOUR LIST SO YOU MAY WANT TO INCLUDE THOSE AS WELL
AWESOME LIST
AWESOME ADDITIONALLY THE MANHATTAN PROJECT CHAIN REACTION IS ONE WHICH GOT LISTED ON DICE STOCKING FILLERS FOR THIS YEAR AND IT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE BOX AS THOSE IN THE SEASONS IMAGE
GREAT LIST FUJI FLUSH WOULD ALSO BE A GREAT ADDITION
I WOULD ADD ZEPPELIN ATTACK BY EVIL HAT QUICK DECK BUILDER AND COMES IN A FAIRLY SMALL BOX
HEY ONE LITTLE CORRECTION YOU HAVE BREW CRAFTER LINKED BUT BREW CRAFTER THE TRAVEL CARD GAME ON THE IMAGE THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT GAMES WITH BREW CRAFTER WEIGHING IN OUTSIDE THE STOCKING STUFFER CATEGORY
GREAT LIST

SOME OF OUR FAVORITES THAT WOULD BE STOCKING STUFFER SIZED THAT YOU COULD CHECK OUT ARE JUST DESSERTS THERE'S A MOOSE IN THE HOUSE AND PERHAPS JAIPUR THE FIRST TWO ARE VERY LIGHT AND SILLY FILLER GAMES
ARBORETUM

IF BILL GATES IS FILLING YOUR STOCKING SURE

GREAT LIST YOU GOTTA GET WISHES IN THERE
WHAT A GREAT LIST THANKS

I BOUGHT CHRONONAUGHTS AFTER READING THIS HIS THREAD HOPE THE KIDS LIKE IT AT LEAST IT MIGHT TEACH THEM SOME HISTORY
ROADS BOATS CAN BE QUITE CUTTHROAT AT TIMES BUT IT DOES HAVE A FOUR PLAYER MAP WHERE EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN LITTLE MAP TO WORK ON THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO ANY OTHERS THERE'S STILL A BIT OF A WRESTLE OVER POINTS IN TERMS OF MONUMENT BUILDING BUT OTHERWISE IT'S THE PUREST MULTIPLAYER SOLITAIRE I THINK I'VE SEEN IN A GAME

PRETTY GOOD SOLO VARIANT TOO IF YOU LIKE GAMES THAT ARE EFFECTIVELY POINT OPTIMIZATION PUZZLES THERE'S NO RANDOMNESS AT ALL SO IF YOU TAKE THE SAME MOVES ON A PARTICULAR MAP YOU'LL GET THE EXACT SAME RESULT
AGRICOLA CAN HAVE CUTTHROAT COMPETITION WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN YOUR GROUP IF SOMEONE PAID ATTENTION AND TOOK ALL THE REED BEFORE YOU COULD MAKE AN EXTENSION OR CLEARED OUR THE FISHING HOLE JUST TO SPITE YOU
MAYBE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AT LEAST I DON'T PLAY PARTICULARLY COMPETITIVELY OR CUTTHROAT
I WOULD SUGGEST CAVERN AND ROLL FOR THE GALAXY CAVERN AND AGRICOLA ARE VERY SIMILAR BUT CAVERN IS EVEN LESS DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE ROLL FOR THE GALAXY IS VERY MUCH MULTIPLAYER SOLITAIRE
AT THE GATES OF LOYANG

MULTIPLAYER SOLITAIRE
STRONG EMPHASIS ON OPTIMIZATION
MEDIUM WEIGHT EURO GAME
ONE OF THE BEST SOLO BOARD GAMES
AGRICOLA CAN BE EXTREMELY CUTTHROAT IT MIGHT NOT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
AUTOMANIA IS A RECENT FAVORITE THERE IS TILE DRAFTING SO SOMEONE MAY SNATCH UP SOMETHING YOU NEED WANT ALSO THERE'S A BIT OF A RACE IN TERMS OF PRODUCING BETTER CARS FASTER BUT EVERYONE IS STILL KIND OF DOING THEIR OWN THING GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL IS GOOD AS WELL AND ISTANBUL THE INTERACTION IN ALL OF THESE IS INDIRECT SO ANY MESSING WITH OTHER PEOPLE IS USUALLY INCIDENTAL NOT AGGRESSIVE

DISCLAIMER MOST EUROS CAN POTENTIALLY STILL BE PRETTY SAVAGE
AS FAR AS THE GROUP SOLITAIRE CATEGORY GOES I WOULD RECOMMEND ROLL FOR THE GALAXY DDK IF YOU CAN CATEGORIZE IT AS EURO BUT ITS DEFINITELY NOT AMERITRASH WHILE THE GAME PLAY IS ENTIRELY DICE BASED THERE ARE ENOUGH WAYS TO MITIGATE THE DICE ROLL TO NOT FEEL LIKE YOU'RE TOTAL BEHOLDEN TO WHAT COMES OUT OF YOUR CUP ALSO THE SPECIAL POWERS YOU GET AS YOU BUILD OUT YOUR ENGINE KEEP MULTIPLE PLAYS FROM FEELING TOO SIMILAR

THERE DOESN'T HAVE OFFICIAL SOLO PLAY BUT THERE ARE SOLO VARIANTS ON BG
OUR FOUR YEAR OLD HAS BEEN WINNING A NOFARMERS VARIANT OF CARCASSONNE MUCH OF THIS YEAR WE USED TILE MATCHING WITHOUT SCORING THE FIRST TIME TO DEMONSTRATE THE MECHANICS AND TILE LAYING RULES HE REQUIRES ONE OR TWO SUGGESTIONS A GAME NOW BUT HE'S PLAYED BETWEEN AND TIMES
I THINK THE BASE CARCASSONNE WITHOUT THE FARMERS WOULD WORK WELL I'VE NOT PLAYED THE STAR WARS VERSION BUT IF HE'S A SW FAN HE'D PROBABLY ENJOY THAT ONE EVEN MORE LABYRINTH IS ALSO A GREAT GAME HAVEN'T PLAYED IN A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT IT DOES WORK GREAT WITH YOUNGER KIDS AS WELL OF THESE THREE CARCASSONNE HAS THE MOST POSSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL EXPANSIONS DOWN THE LINE SO IN YEARS TO COME IT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE ONE I'D CHOOSE
DAD HERE WITH A AND YO

TOP GAMES WE BOTH LIKE TO PLAY ALL ARE A BIT ON THE SHORT SIDE OF MINUTES I DON'T KNOW ANY GAME THAT TAKES AN HOUR TO PLAY THAT KIDS WILL UNDERSTAND AND SIT THROUGH

LABYRINTH
KING OF TOKYO
SURVIVE
STRATEGE
BLOCKUS

ALSO DON'T FORGET TO GIVE THEM A DOSE OF THE CLASSICS CHESS BACKGAMMON OTHELLO SET MEN'S MORRIS MANCALA ARE ALL EASY TO LEARN BUT HARD TO MASTER

MY YEAR OLD ENJOYS MY FIRST CARCASSONNE A LOT MAYBE GIVE THAT A TRY
I WOULD SUGGEST MY FIRST CARCASSONNE MY AND YEAR OLDS REALLY LIKE IT IT'S STILL A TILE LAYING GAME BUT MUCH SIMPLER ALL TILES CAN BE JOINED ANYWAY YOU ARE TRYING TO COMPLETE ROADS WITH YOUR COLOUR MEEDLESS ON THEM FIRST TO PLACE OR CAN'T REMEMBER WINS SIMPLE FUN YOU CAN EVEN HELP OR HINDER OTHER PEOPLE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU GUYS LIKE TO PLAY GAMES IT'S A GOOD INTRODUCTION TO CARCASSONNE
MONSTER FACTORY HAS A BIT MORE KID FRIENDLY THEME

QWIRKLE IS ANOTHER GOOD ALL AGES GAME
HOW ABOUT LOONY QUEST
KINGDOMINO HAS BEEN A HIT WITH MY KIDS THEIR COUSINS AND ADULTS AS WELL
I WOULD RECOMMEND DAYS IN AFRICA IF YOU CAN FIND IT IT IS OUT OF PRINT I THINK YOU ARE TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING AND GEOGRAPHY AND IT IS FUN IT WAS A MENSA SELECT WINNER AND CAN BE PLAYED WITH KIDS SO IF YOU CAN FIND IT THAT WOULD BE MY CHOICE
I'VE PLAYED ALL GAMES WITH MY YEAR OLD SON YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANY OF THEM YES KIDS OF CARCASSONNE IS VERY LIGHT BUT STILL ENJOYABLE FOR ME MAYBE LOOK AT TICKET TO RIDE FIRST JOURNEY TOO AVAILABLE IN USA
I JUST STARTED WORKING ON A GEEKIEST FOR THIS THE OTHER DAY
HAMM THINKING BACK WE WOULD PLAY A LOT OF KINDER BUNNIES LABYRINTH THE RAVENSBURGER VERSION BUT WITH THE HANDICAPS CHICKEN CHA CHA CHA AND EVEN CAVE TROLL IN FACT MY YEAR-OLD OFTEN BEAT EVERYONE AT CAVE TROLL TO OUR FRUSTRATION

THESE DAYS I'D TRY SOME OF THE BREI CAGIER GAMES LIKE THE MAGIC LABYRINTH AND THE ENCHANTED TOWER ANOTHER ONE THAT'S REALLY FUN FOR ALL AGES IS GHOST BLITZ
I BOUGHT CARCASSONNE HUNTERS AND GATHERERS WHEN MINE WERE PRETTY YOUNG IT WORKS PRETTY WELL ESPECIALLY IF THE HUNTERS LIKE FARMERS ARE NOT USED UNTIL THEY GET THE OTHER ASPECTS DOWN WE STILL PLAY IT FROM TIME TO TIME EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD IT ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW AND HAVE LOADS OF OTHER GAMES
LABYRINTH IS FANTASTIC CAN'T RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH
RULES ARE COMPLETELY SIMPLE ENOUGH FOR YOUNGSTERS TO GRASP
YES YOU DID

YOU'RE USING OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY FOR THIS THIS IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THEM AND IS WRONG

2 YOUR GIRLFRIEND WOULD EVIDENTLY BREAK UP WITH YOU OVER IT DOESN'T THIS CALL INTO QUESTION THE WISDOM OF THIS FOR YOU

YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL EVEN LIKE IT YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE AND YOU'RE PREPARED TO DROP ON IT

YOU COULD GET LITERALLY OTHER GAMES FOR THIS PRICE WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU SPENDING IT ALL ON ONE GAME WHEN YOUR COLLECTION IS SO SMALL

YOU WON'T EVEN BE GETTING IT UNTIL DECEMBER OF THAT'S YEARS FROM NOW DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG YEARS IS WHO KNOWS WHAT YOUR TASTES WILL BE IN YEARS GET SOMETHING YOU KNOW YOU'LL LIKE NOW INSTEAD

ALL IN ALL PLEASE CANCEL YOUR PLEDGE AND CONSIDER TALKING TO SOMEONE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THE FACT THAT YOU'D EVEN THINK ABOUT MAKING THIS PURCHASE IS A PROBLEM
YOU DID NOT DO ANYTHING YOU HAVE MORE THEN ONE MONTH TO COOL DOWN AND RECONSIDER
YES
BEST PLAN WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO SPEND A GOOD CHUNK OF MONEY TEST REVIEW AND CONTEMPLATE

TEST YOU CAN BUY TABLETOP SIMULATOR FOR ABOUT RIGHT NOW ON STEAM AND YOU CAN TRY KD M THERE TRY IT OUT YOURSELF AND MAYBE EVEN BUY A COPY FOR YOUR BROTHER AND FRIEND A PACK COSTS THE MINIS IN THE GAME AREN'T SUPER WELL MADE SO YOU'LL KNOW IF YOU LIKE THE GAME SYSTEM OR IF YOU'RE JUST WOWED BY THE MINIS

REVIEW THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF REVIEWS ON THE WEB VIDEO AND TEXT ABOUT THE GAME READ THEM REALLY LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH AND READ THE RULEBOOK YOURSELF

CONTEMPLATE REALLY THINK TO YOURSELF ARE YOU GOING TO BE PLAYING THIS YEAR AFTER YOU GET YOUR PLEDGE WHAT ABOUT 2 YEARS HOW OFTEN WILL THIS GAME TO THE TABLE

IN THE END IF YOU'RE CAREFUL WITH THE PRODUCT EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU COULD PROBABLY NOT SELL YOUR COPY FOR AT LEAST WHAT YOU PAID FOR AND A LITTLE BIT MORE
DON'T USE YOUR INEXPERIENCED FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO BUY THIS GET THE BASE GAME AND MAYBE GAMBLERS CHEST ON YOUR OWN YOU CAN BUY EVERYTHING DISCOUNTED NEXT BLACK FRIDAY IF YOU NEED TO THIS IS NOT A GOOD DECISION
FOR WHY NOT GET OTHER GOOD GAMES YOU COULD GET CAMPAIGN GAMES TO SCRATCH THE SAME ITCH SOME MINIATURES GAMES SOME RAGS SOME BATTLE GAMES
I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO WATCH MANY PLAYTHROUGH VIDEOS OUT THERE WITH YOUR BROTHER AND BEST FRIEND AND DECIDE WHETHER YOU WILL ENJOY THE GAME OR NOT FROM SEEING THOSE VIDEOS

THAT WAS WHAT I HAD DONE AND FINALLY I THOUGHT THE GAME IS TOO PUNISHING FOR MY TASTE

IN THE END OF THE DAY IT IS YOUR MONEY AND YOUR BROTHER'S AND YOUR BEST FRIEND'S SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
I THINK YOU MEANT TO BOAT THIS IN R BOARDGAMESCIRCLEJERK
I WOULD CANCEL THE PLEDGE I BUY EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE GAMES AND CANNOT IMAGINE YOU WILL GET DOLLARS WORTH OF ENJOYMENT OUT OF THIS
IF YOU KEEP YOUR PLEDGE THROUGH THEN YES I TRULY BELIEVE YOU HAVE WASTED YOUR MONEY THE ONLY CHANCE YOU HAVE GOTTEN SOMETHING VALUABLE FROM THIS PLEDGE IS THAT YOU'RE A GOOD INVESTOR WHERE YOU ARE PLANNING TO SELL THIS OFF AT A GOOD PROFIT MAYBE LATER VIA EBAY IF YOU HAVE NEVER OR RARELY BUY AND SELL OFF SOMETHING WITH A PROFIT IN YOUR LIFE TILL NOW THEN I DOUBT YOU ARE DOING IT THAT FOR NOW

FROM YOUR DESCRIPTION YOU ARE EMOTIONALLY EXCITED BY THAT KS AND WISHING TO GET A COMPLETE SET AND NOT FOR HAVING FUN PLAYING IT FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY YOU SPLURGE YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE FUN BY BUYING TONS OF OTHER GAMES VIA AMAZON CSI CH OR MM YOU HAVE ZERO CHANCE OF GETTING THAT MUCH OF FROM THAT SINGLE KS

AND WORST YOU'RE BUYING SOMETHING THAT YOU BELIEVE IS OF IMMENSE VALUE TO YOU AND ASSUME EVERYONE AROUND YOU WILL LOVE IT AS WELL BUT LIKELY YOUR GAMING BUDDIES WILL NOT THINK SO AND THEN YOU FEEL HURT BECAUSE YOU REALIZE THEY ARE NOT WITH YOU ARE YOU GOING TO UNFRIEND THEM BASICALLY YOU'RE SPLURGING TO RUIN YOUR RELATIONSHIP NOT WORTH IT OF COURSE IF YOU'RE BILLIONAIRE RICH SAY LIKE BARON OUR FIRST THEN YEAH GO AHEAD MIGHT AS WELL PLEDGE A FEW MORE SET FOR ALL YOUR FRIENDS AS WELL AND ME

EVERYONE ELSE HERE WHO SAY YOU'RE NOT ARE LYING OR WORST BEING PC BECAUSE DEEP DOWN INSIDE THEY THEMSELVES WISHED THEY PLEDGED THAT BUT IN REALITY THEY CAN'T OR UNWILLING TO
GOOD FOR YOU

DO WHAT BRINGS YOU JOY

I'M ENVIOUS I'M STUCK AT THE PLEDGE WITH A BACKUP PLEDGE IN CASE I PANIC LATER BUT I'VE DEBATED A BIGGER PLEDGE ON AND OFF SINCE THE CAMPAIGN BEGAN
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO ACCURATELY PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL FIND YOUR PLEDGE TO BE OF VALUE OR PREDICT IF YOU HAVE BUYERS REMORSE
WHAT VIDEOS DID YOU SHOW THEM I NEED HELP JUSTIFYING MY HA HA
I BACKED A FEW KICKSTARTERS THESE ARE THE GENERAL RESULTS FROM SUCH AN EXPERIENCE WHICH FORTUNATELY I ALWAYS BACKED LOW APART FROM ONE EXCEPTION WHICH ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE THE BIGGEST STINKER AT ABOUT

THE LOWER YOUR PLEDGE LEVEL THE BETTER RISK SHOULD BE SPREAD THROUGH AS MANY PLEDGERS AS POSSIBLE AT THE LOWEST COST PER PLEDGER IMO THIS IS HOW CROWDFUNDING SHOULD MOST POSITIVELY WORK FOR OBVIOUS REASONS
2 THE HIGHER YOUR PLEDGE LEVEL THE CALCULATION YOU'RE MAKING IS THE HIGHER I PLEDGE THE MORE REWARD I WILL GET THAT I NEED ALTERNATIVELY VALUE FOR COLLECTORS
I THINK THIS IS NOT JUST ADDITIVELY RISKY BUT EXPONENTIALLY RISKY IT'S MUCH MUCH EASIER TO OVER-ESTIMATE THE UTILITY YOU WILL GET OUT OF A FUTURE PURCHASE THAN UNDER-ESTIMATE IT
THE RISK ALSO IS THAT SOMETHING ELSE GOES WRONG WITH THE KICKSTARTER EG DELAY OR ELSE OPPORTUNITY COST NOW OR YOU FIND SOME THINGS SPREADING YOUR INVESTMENT OVER WOULD HAVE YIELDED GREATER REWARD CUMULATIVELY
REMEMBER YOUR MONEY IS DURING THE PROCESS OF DELIVERING THE KICKSTARTER FOR A FAIRLY LONG PERIOD UNLIKE AN INSTANT PURCHASE EXCHANGE OF GOODS AND MONEY IN A REGULAR SALE

OF THE KICKSTARTERS I BACKED ALMOST ALL DELAYED MOST WERE SUBSTANDARD SOME WERE REASONABLE BUT THE HYPE HAD WORN OFF LONG BEFORE I GOT THE GAME AND ALMOST FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT BARELY WAS ACTUALLY WORTH IT WHICH IS NOT DISSIMILAR TO NORMAL JUST BECAUSE IT'S ON KICKSTARTER AND CRYING OUT FOR FUNDS TO MAKE THE MAGIC HAPPEN GOOD WITH MANY MAKES THAT HARSH REALITY NO DIFFERENT

I'D SAY ONLY THE PURCHASER CAN ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF THEIR PURCHASE TO THEMSELVES ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH DISPOSABLE INCOME THEY HAVE AND WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY FOR TAKING A REGULAR SCENARIO OF REGULAR PERSON BACKING

AT THAT PLEDGE LEVEL THE RISK SEEMS ALMIGHTILY HIGH TO REWARD RATIO I WOULD NEVER BACK HIGHER THAN WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD WITHOUT BLINKING OR THINKING ABOUT TO LOSE


I STARTED BY GETTING A SECOND HAND COPY FOR A GOOD PRICE I WAS SURE IT WOULD NOT BE WORTH THE HIGH COST INSTEAD TO MY SUNRISE IT WAS THE BEST GAME IV EVER PLAYED IT WAS JUST THE THING IV ALWAYS WANTED FROM A GAME SO I SPENT A FORTUNE ON GETTING ALL OF THE EXTRA EXPANSIONS ETC ALSO IF I HADNT LIKED IT I COULD HAVE RESOLD IT WITH PROFFIT SO IF PUSH COMES TO SHOVE AND YOU DONT LIKE IT JUST SELL IT

I SEE SOME PEOPLE SUGGEST TRYING IT OUT ON TABLETOP SIMULATOR DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TRY TO FIND A REAL COPY TO PLAY THE MEINIES AND PLAYER INTERACTION MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE
I HAVE THE GAME AND LOVE IT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED I'M BIASED THE GAME IS INCREDIBLY AWESOME

FROM A SKILL LEVEL POV YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX I DON'T BELIEVE THE GAME MECHANICS ARE REALLY THAT HARD THAN WHAT YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT GAME FROM WHAT YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING

SHOULD YOU GO ALL IN THAT'S FOR YOU AND YOU'RE BUDGET TO DECIDE THE QUALITY OF THE GAME IS CERTAINLY WORTH EVERY PENNY YOU WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND A GAME WITH HIGHER QUALITY COMPONENTS THERE IS A LOT OF GAME PLAY W O EVEN USING THE EXPANSIONS

MINIATURES ARE YOU PREPARED TO GLUE AND ASSEMBLE ALL OF THE MONSTERS SURVIVORS AND THE ARMOR KITS SOME PEOPLE ARE INTIMIDATED BY THIS IF YOU'VE EVERY BUILT A PLASTIC MODEL KIT THIS IS OLD HAT IF NOT THEN IT'S CERTAINLY ANOTHER CONSIDERATION THE MODELS DON'T NEED TO BE PAINTED THEY LOOK GREAT PLAIN BUT THEY DO BEG TO BE PAINTED

WATCH A COUPLE OF TWITCH EPISODES I KNOW THERE ARE A FEW GROUPS OUT THERE THAT ARE POSTING SESSIONS I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO SEE WHAT GAME PLAY IS LIKE

YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ALL IN RIGHT AWAY I'VE NOT DONE THE COMPARISON BUT SEE IF IT'S ANY DIFFERENT TO PLEDGE FOR THE GAME NOW AND BE CHARGED WHEN THE KS ENDS AND THEN WHEN THE PLEDGE MANAGER COMES AROUND WHICH COULD EASILY BE A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE KS ENDS THEN CHOOSE YOU'RE AND BE CHARGED FOR THOSE THIS WAY YOU CAN DIVIDE UP WHAT YOU'RE PAYING INTO SMALLER CHUNKS

HOPE THIS HELPS YOU IN COMING TO A DECISION
I JUST PLEDGED THE ANCIENT LANTERN LEVEL MYSELF AFTER MISSING OUT ON THE ORIGINAL KICKSTARTER WATCHING A PLAY THROUGH VIDEO AND BEING TOTALLY INTRIGUED BUT THEN GETTING SCARED AWAY AT THE HUGE RESELLER PRICES ON THE NET

THEN I STUMBLED ONTO THE KS AND I FIGURE I COULD SIMPLY RESELL THIS FOR MORE MONEY ALONG WITH ALL OF THE CURRENT EXPANSIONS IF I DON'T END UP LIKING THE GAME

I HAVE A QUESTION MYSELF GUYS I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD TO BUILD THE PIECES YOURSELF AFTER THE MINIATURES ARE BUILT WILL I BE ABLE TO FIT THE MINIATURES BACK INTO THE BOX OR NO SILLY AS IT SOUNDS THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE DEALBREAKER I LIVE IN AN NYC APARTMENT AND DON'T HAVE THE ROOM FOR IT IF I CAN'T PUT THEM ALL BACK INTO THE BOX
WELL IF YOU ARE RICH GUY AND IS NOT A LOT FOR YOU THEN YOU DID NOT WASTE THEM IF YOU ARE NOT THAT RICH I WOULD PROBABLY NOT INVEST THAT MUCH IN SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER PLAYED NOR DO I KNOW WILL I LIKE IT IN THE END

LETS FACE IT JUST BASE GAME IS LONG ENOUGH AND YOU NEED DEDICATED GROUP TO PLAY IT I DON'T THINK THAT IT WOULD BE FUN IF PEOPLE KEEP DROOPING OUT AFTER SESSIONS EACH TIME
GAME IS HARD SO YOU WILL PROBABLY REPEAT IT AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE YOU BEAT IT

YOU CAN GET SEVERAL EXPANSIONS THAT ADD SO MUCH TO REPLAY ABILITY

ARE YOU MINIATURE COLLECTOR AND PAINTER BECAUSE IF YOU ARE NOT THEN THOSE PIN UPS GET YOU NOTHING

I BET THAT MOST OF PEOPLE WHO GOT ALL EXPANSIONS LAST TIME DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO PROPERLY PLAY HALF OF THEM SINCE FROM WHAT I READ GAME IS RECOMMENDED TO PLAY WITH AROUND EXPANSIONS AND FIRST TIME YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT ANY

SO UNLESS THIS IS ONLY GAME YOU WILL PLAY FOR YEARS TO COME AND YOU HAVE DEDICATED GROUP TO PLAY WHOLE CAMPAIGNS IT'S PROBABLY NOT WORTH IT TO GO ALL IN ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE NOT SURE RIGHT NOW

ALSO LOOK AT SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND FLAWS THAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE GAME DO YOU HAVE PROBLEM WITH A LOOT OF BOOK KEEPING DO YOU MIND OH YOU ROLL YOU ARE DEAD PERIOD START WITH NEW GUY BECAUSE GUY YOU PUT ALL THAT HARD WORK IN JUST HAD A BAD ROLL AFTER DEFEATING EPIC MONSTER ON THE WAY HOME
DELETED
I'VE CUT DOWN FROM FOUR TO THREE GAMES THIS MONTH AND GIVEN EACH ONE A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION HOPE FOLKS ENJOY
CONGRATS ON THE COLUMN VERY COOL TO SEE THIS KIND OF EXPOSURE IN SUCH A WELL KNOWN PUBLICATION
I'VE BEEN LOVING HAND OF THE KING IT DEFINITELY PLAYS BEST AT THOUGH WHICH BASICALLY MAKES IT A CHESSYLITE HEAD TO HEAD ABSTRACT STRATEGY GAME
NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH AN INSTAGRAM FACEBOOK DEDICATED TO BOARD GAMES
REGULAR ROUNDUP OF THE BEST NEW TABLETOP TITLES

MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE YOUR TITLE A BIT WHEN YOU PICK SUCH TITLES AS A GAME OF THRONES HAND OF THE KING AND HMS DOLORES

I GET THAT WITH THE GUARDIAN YOU HAVE AN AUDIENCE THAT NEEDS A BIT FRIENDLIER GAMES BUT YOUR PICK OF TITLES HERE IS VERY SKETCHY AND CALLING THEM THE BEST IS DOWNRIGHT SILLY

IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE EXPOSURE IN SUCH A WELL KNOWN MEDIUM THOUGH AND THE WRITEUPS ARE NICE I JUST WONDER WHY YOU CHOSE THESE TITLES THERE SEEM TO BE SO MUCH BETTER OPTIONS AVAILABLE EVEN IF YOU WANT TO APPEAL TO A MORE MAINSTREAM AUDIENCE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT FRAME OF REFERENCE YOU HAVE FOR RELEASE THIS MONTH I SUPPOSE WIDESPREAD RELEASE IN US STORES BUT SURELY YOU REVIEW SOME BETTER TITLES THAN THESE IF YOU GO FOR THE BEST

I MEAN CAPTAIN SONAR ISN'T REALLY NEW EITHER WHY NOT COVER TITLES LIKE ANIS TERRAFORMING MARS IMHOTEP HARRY POTTER HOGWARTS BATTLE MACHS V MINIONS CODENAMES ICTUSES THE NETWORKS ETC

I GET YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SELECTION AND CAN'T MENTION ALL GAMES BUT OUTSIDE OF CAPTAIN SONAR YOU'VE GOT SOME QUIRKY CHOICES HERE
SO EVERYONE WINS WHEN TAYLOR GETS EATEN
THIS IS MY FRIEND GAME SHE'S ACES SO IF YOU LOVE GILMORE GIRLS AND PARTY GAMES PLEASE BUY AS MANY COPIES AS KIRK HAS JOBS
YOU JUST FOUND THE PERFECT CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR SOMEONE ON MY LIST
CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE GAME A BIT HOW CLOSE IS IT TO ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THAT
IS ACTUALLY AMAZING IS THERE A KIRK CHARACTER CARD
VERY COOL HOW LONG DOES A ROUND USUALLY LAST
I PLAYED THIS GAME WITH THEM IT IS AWESOME AND WEIRD AND THE ARTWORK IS FANTASTIC
I LOVE BOTH WEREWOLVES OF MILLERS HOLLOW AND GILMORE GIRLS SO THIS LOOKS PERFECT FOR ME
THIS LOOKS AMAZING IS IT PLAYABLE WITH PEOPLE
I PLAYED THIS WITH MY FAMILY OVER THE HOLIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME THE GAME IS DIFFERENT EVERY TIME BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY OPTIONAL CHARACTER CARDS WITH DIFFERENT SPECIAL ABILITIES SO THE MODERATOR CAN CUSTOMIZE THE GAME
YEAH I FEEL LIKE THE BLACK BOX IDEA COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY GREAT AND COULD HAVE REALLY BEEN SOMETHING PEOPLE LOOK FORWARD TO EVERY YEAR BUT THEY RAN IT INTO THE GROUND

THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T TOSS IN A LOVE LETTER RETHEME SHOWS THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING PUT IN AN EXCLUSIVE GUILDHALL THEMED DECK OR WHATEVER PRODUCT YOU WANT TO SLING AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE A FEW THINGS AND CALL IT A DAY


APPARENTLY YOU'RE GETTING A SINGLE NEW GAME CALLED PHASE
I THINK IF I GOT THE BOX AT FULL PRICE I WOULD FEEL RIPPED OFFICIAL HOWEVER I GOT IT PRETTY CHEAP AND I THINK IT'S DECENT
THERE WAS A VIDEO TUTORIAL REVIEW THAT CAME OUT

WATCH V
AS A PERSON WHO PLAYS A LOT AT A MAGIC SHOP THE GAME IN THIS YEAR'S BLACK BOX PHASE IS AMAZING IT IS JUST ENOUGH MAGIC WHILE STILL MAINTAINING BOARD GAME FEEL THAT I CAN CON THE OTHERS INTO PLAYING WITH ME

RAVENS OF HRI SAHASHRI INTERESTING ASYMMETRIC COOP CARD GAME

KANNUME GODDESS OF DECKBUILDER

GOD'S GAMBIT CARD GAME

SAKURA ARMS ANOTHER INTERESTING DUELING CARD GAME

MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE MILLENNIUM BLADES FOR TWO REASONS THE FIRST IS THAT ITS A GREAT GAME THE SECOND IS THAT THE MECHANICS TIE INTO AND RE-ENFORCE THE THEME WHILE STUFF LIKE BARBAROSSA TANTO CHORE DYNAMITE NURSE HEART OF CROWN ETC ALL HAVE SOLID MECHANICS THE MECHANICS DONT REALLY TIE INTO THE THEME WHEREAS WITH MILLENNIUM BLADES THE MECHANICS ARE INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED WITH THE THEME

MY BACKUP RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TRAGEDY LOOPER THE MECHANICS HERE GENERATE THE SAME KIND OF STORIES AS THE VISUAL NOVEL THE GAME IS INSPIRED BY ADMITTEDLY IN SOMEWHAT MORE ABSTRACT TERMS
BOARDGAME BOMI
THERE IS THE SPACE DANDY BOARD GAME A PRETTY DECENT DECKBUILDER IT NEEDED MORE PLAYTESTING THOUGH

A COUPLE OTHERS THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER OVERALL I THINK I DID PRETTY WELL

I AM NEW TO THE HOBBY AND NEEDED SOME OF THE CLASSIC ONES SO MOST OF THESE DEALS WOULDN'T BE FOR THE MORE EXPERIENCED PLAYERS WHO ALREADY OWN THEM

EDIT ALSO FLASH SALE ON AMAZON FOR MARKHAM HORROR AND THE GAME OF THRONES BOARD GAME RESPECTIVELY WASN'T TOO GREAT OF A DEAL BUT IT WAS A LITTLE BETTER THAN I HAVE SEEN THEM ANYWHERE
JUST WENT TO THE LOCAL SHOP NO AMAZING DEALS SINCE ALL THE WAS ON SALE WAS CATAN AND EXPANSIONS UNFORTUNATELY LOOKED AT VITICULTURE AND SCYTHE AND THEY WERE CHEAPER THAN AMAZON PRICES BUT STILL OUT OF MY RANGE FOR NOW ESPECIALLY WITH WANTING TO BACK KINGDOM DEATH CONSIDERED THE LATEST HOKKAIDO EXPANSION BUT JUST WENT FOR A BASE COPY OF VALLEY OF THE KINGS INSTEAD

AFTER AN AMAZON COUPON I GOT LAS VEGAS AND ORDER OF THE GILDED COMPASS FOR COMBINED
JEALOUS AS FUCK OF THAT DEAL MANUAL
I'M NOT SURE HOW BADLY YOUR BOXES GOT DAMAGED BUT WHEN MY CORNERS SPLIT I USE A SINGLE STRIP OF MASKING TAPE ON THE OUTSIDE AND THE INSIDE OF THE BOX SEEMS TO DO THE TRICK
I'M GOING TO ASSUME YOU MEAN CORNERS GOT RIPPED I'VE REPAIRED MANY BOXES THAT HAVE BEEN RIPPED UP AND HAD THEM LOOKING ALMOST NEW WHAT I DO IS USE WOOD GLUE POUR A BLOB ONTO SOME CARDBOARD OR THICK PAPER THEN APPLY IT TO THE RIPPED AREA USING A BEING CAREFUL NOT TO GET ANY ON THE OUTSIDE OR GRAPHIC PORTION ON THE BOX PUSH TOGETHER FOLDING THE OUTSIDES ONTO EACH OTHER AND THEN HOLD THEM TOGETHER WITH A BIT OF TAPE GIVE IT A COUPLE HOURS OR IF YOU ARE USING THE FAST SETTING STUFF THEN REMOVE THE TAPE FINALLY I RE-ENFORCE THE CORNER BY CUTTING A SQUARE FROM A THICK PIECE OF PAPER FOLDING IT TO FIT INSIDE THE CORNER AND GLUING THAT INTO PLACE

DON'T LEAVE TAPE ON THE BOX LEAVE IT FOR TOO LONG AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GET IT OFF WITHOUT RIPPING UP THE BOX

THERE IS A YOUTUBE VIDEO OF A GUY DOING THIS SOMEWHERE I'LL TRY AND FIND IT AFTER I GET COFFEE GOING
THERE'S A WHOLE THREAD GEEK LIST MAYBE ON BG ABOUT REPAIR TIPS AND TECHNIQUES FOR ALL SORTS OF DAMAGE DONE TO GAMES ON MOBILE NOW AND CAN'T LINK BUT YOU COULD PROBABLY GOOGLE IT UP
AS ALTERNATIVE I THINK IT WAS DICE TOWER THAT REVIEWED A TRAVEL BAG WHERE THEY ENCOURAGED PUTTING GAME COMPONENTS IN DIPLOIC BAGS THEIR CLAIM WAS THAT BOXES ARE MOSTLY EMPTY SPACE ANYWAY
PROBABLY HELPS TO GIVE MORE CONTEXT THE COAL CHUTE ON ITS OWN SAYS NOTHING ABOUT YOU AUTOMATICALLY WINNING WHEN YOU PUT A TOKEN ON IT
NOT SURE WHAT HAUNT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT SINCE YOU ARE BRINGING IT UP IN HAUNT IF THE COAL CHUTE IS A GROUND FLOOR ROOM DO YOU STILL FALL TO THE BASEMENT IF YOU SUCCEED THE MIGHT ROLL AND FLIP THE ROOM TILE

I CAN THINK OF 2 POSSIBLE GAMES


SUPERTIGHT WHERE YOU TAKE CARDS AND ARGUE WHY YOUR CREATURE WOULD WIN EX HAWKING WITH A LASER OR WITH A CHAINSAW


DRUNK STONED OR STUPID SLIGHTLY SIMILAR TO CH BUT NOT REALLY A PERSON GETS A TOPIC AND YOU GUYS ARGUE WHO IT APPLIES MORE TO EX WHO DESERVES THE ACTS THE MOST IMMATURE CARD


I REALLY ENJOY DRUNK STONED OR STUPID BUT BOTH ARE QUITE FUN PARTY GAMES THOUGH
EDIT ALSO A COUPLE OF OTHER GAMES I ENJOY FOR LARGE PARTIES ARE ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF AND BANG
CHECK OUT SNAKE OIL IT'S A CARD GAME WHERE YOU GET TO ARGUE WHY THE ACTIVE PLAYER SHOULD BUY YOUR WACKY PRODUCT AND THEN AWARDS POINTS IN A SIMILAR WAY AS CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY
METAGRAM
APPLES TO APPLES IS BASICALLY THE BORING VANILLA VERSION OF CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY

IS THIS THE ON YOU WERE THINKING OF
IF YOU'RE ARGUING OVER WHICH CHARACTER WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT THAT'S SUPERTIGHT
IS IT THIS ONE

I HAD A BRILLIANT TIME LAST YEAR PLAYING MONIKERS WITH MY FAMILY WE PLAYED WITH TWELVE AND I'M SURE IT WOULD GO HIGHER
ALSO WITH THAT DESCRIPTION I RECOMMEND STIPULATIONS CHECK IT OUT
WHAT ABOUT THE POLITICS GAME FROM JUSTIN ROBERT YOUNG THE CONTENDER THAT'S MORE ABOUT POLITICAL DEBATES THOUGH
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF
IF YOU HAVE A SMALLER GROUP AND WANT A LITTLE MORE THEME BUT KEEP THE ARGUING BARGAINING THEN TRY SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM

EACH TURN ONE PLAYER IS THE SHERIFF ALLOWING DENYING MERCHANTS SHIPMENTS TO REACH MARKET HE OR SHE CAN TAKE BRIBES CONFISCATE GOODS AND MAKE DEALS
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY REPRESENTS THE PINNACLE OF FAMILY GAMING IF YOU CAN'T HAVE FUN PLAYING CH WITH GRANDMA MAYBE TRY JUST PLAYING SOLITAIRE

NOT ALL FAMILIES ARE TRUE GAMERS
IF YOU HAVE THE BEGINNER GAME ALREADY THEN PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY THING YOU NEED IS THE CORE RULEBOOK

AFTER A WHILE EXTRA DICE WILL COME IN HANDY SINCE DICE POOLS CAN GET A BIT CRAZY IN LATER PLAY PERSONALLY I BOUGHT THREE SETS TOTAL INCLUDING THE BEGINNER GAME SET AND THAT IS ABOUT RIGHT FOR MY LEVEL OF PLAY IT'S BEEN A LONG CAMPAIGN

IF YOU WANT TO RUN A GAME THE PUBLISHED ADVENTURES ARE QUITE GOOD BUT THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT QUALITY FREE STUFF AND YOU CAN ALWAYS CREATE YOUR OWN

IF YOU'RE A PLAYER YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT THE RELEVANT BOOK FOR YOUR CAREER FOR MORE OPTIONS BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT NECESSARY

I ALSO PERSONALLY USE A SMALL WHITEBEARD TO SKETCH OUT ENCOUNTER MAPS WHERE NECESSARY JUST SO PEOPLE HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT'S WHERE MINIS TOO ARE NICE BUT NOT NECESSARY YOU CAN USE CHITS POKER CHIPS PRINTED STANDEES OR EVEN JUST MARK POSITIONS RIGHT ON THE MAP COMBAT IN BOTE IS MUCH MORE ABSTRACTED

I HAVE THE SCREEN BUT I JUST LAY IT FLAT AS A REFERENCE SINCE I DON'T LIKE TO USE A SCREEN WHEN I GM THE ADVENTURE THAT COMES WITH IT IS FAIRLY GOOD THOUGH

AS A GM I ALSO HAVE THE STAR WORDS APP ON MY TABLET FOR DOING THE OPENING CRAWL FOR EACH SESSION WHICH MY PLAYERS SEEM TO LIKE

APART FROM THAT PAPER AND PENCIL IS PRETTY MUCH ALL YOU NEED
YOU MAY GET MORE HELP AT R RPG BUT I'M PRETTY SURE YOU JUST NEED THE CORE RULEBOOK AND AN ADVENTURE MODULE EX BEYOND THE RIM MAYBE A GAME MASTER KIT IF YOU WANT A SCREEN FULL OF STATS

DID YOU PLAY THROUGH THE BEGINNER GAME ALREADY THERE'S A RULE SUMMARY AND BEGINNER SCENARIO YOU CAN RUN THROUGH IN THERE
EDGE OF THE EMPIRE DETAILS SMUGGLERS AND HAN SOLO OR BOBA FETT TYPE OF CHARACTERS IF YOU WANT A CAMPAIGN MORE FOCUSED ON THE REBELLION THEN YOU HAVE AGE OF REBELLION CORE BOOK IF PEOPLE WANT TO BE JEDI FOCUSED THEN YOU HAVE THE FORCE AND DESTINY CORE BOOK EACH BOOK CAN BE USED INDEPENDENTLY AND YOU CAN HAVE THE WHOLE GAMUT OF A PARTY WITH ONLY ONE BUT YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH FROM EACH BOOK THOUGH THAT WOULD GET EXPENSIVE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION BEING IF YOU WANT TO BE AN ADVANCED FORCE USER WITH A LIGHTSABER THEN THE OTHER TWO BOOKS WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL XP PROVIDED TO EVEN OUT THE CAN MAKE FORCE AND DESTINY CHARACTERS AS POWERED DOWN AS THE OTHER GROUPS AT THE START IE NO LIGHTSABER BUT SOME SIMPLE FORCE POWERS IF YOU WANT A SMUGGLER WRONG SIDE OF THE LAW BOOK THEN EDGE OF EMPIRE IS ALL YOU NEED TO HAVE
IF YOU'VE GOT THE BEGINNER GAME THEN NOTHING AFTER YOU'VE PLAYED THROUGH THAT THEN YOU ONLY NEED THE CORE RULEBOOK A 2ND SET OF DICE WOULD BE HANDY AND IF THE GM IS INEXPERIENCED THEY MAY WANT TO CONSIDER ONE OF THE ADVENTURE BOOKS

CHECK OUT R SFRPG
DO WHAT I DID GO TO WHEREVER PEOPLE BUY PLAY MAGIC THE GATHERING YOUR FAGS

TALK TO RANDOM PEOPLE ABOUT BOARD GAMES AND ASK IF THERE IS A LOCAL GROUP

FIND OUT THERE IS NO LOCAL GROUP BUT NOW YOU'VE MET A COUPLE LOCAL GAMERS

GO HOME AND WONDER HOW TO PUT A GROUP TOGETHER

GET EVACUATED FROM THE BIGGEST WILDFIRE DISASTER IN CANADIAN HISTORY

COME BACK HOME AND RESUME PONDERING ABOUT HOW TO GET SOME BOARDGAMES ON THE GO

SAY FUCK IT AND CREATE THE BOARDGAME GROUP YOURSELF ON FACEBOOK

GO TELL PEOPLE AT THE FAGS THAT THERE IS A BOARDGAME GROUP FOR YOUR LOCAL AREA NOW

WATCH WORLD 2 OR FIELD OF DREAMS AND CHANT IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME

WHEN THEY COME AND THEY WILL GET A GAME NIGHT ON THE GO AND FEEL FUCKING INCREDIBLE AT THE COMMUNITY YOU JUST GATHERED
SO METUMPS ARE AT SOMEONES HOUSE WHICH I'D RATHER NOT GO TO JUST IN CASE I DON'T LIKE THE PEOPLE AND NOT WANT TO STAY HAS HAPPENED BEFORE

NO DIFFERENT THAN A BAD BLIND DATE JUST HAVE A FRIEND CALL YOU MINUTES IN EITHER STAY OR LEAVE FOR AN EMERGENCY AT THAT POINT

SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR PREDICAMENT THE TWO SUGGESTIONS THAT COME TO MIND ARE

STARTING UP YOUR OWN BOARDGAME NIGHT CONVERTING ANY FRIENDS YOU HAVE INTO GAMERS SLOWLY BY STARTING WITH PARTY GAMES AND FAMILY GAMES

2 GET INTO SOLO BOARDGAMING

HAS QUITE A FEW BOARDGAMES YOU CAN PLAY ONLINE NOT THE SAME AS THE REAL THING BUT IT DOES HELP IN A PINCH

WHAT GAMES ARE THE BIG HITS THESE DAYS WELL TOO MANY TO JUST LIST BUT HERE ARE SEVERAL RESOURCES

HERE IS A CUSTOM SEARCH ON BG OF ALL GAMES IN THAT WERE RATED AND NOT OBSCURE RATED BY USERS
SAME THING FOR

ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU WANT TO WATCH VIDEOS HERE'S THE DICE OPINIONS ON




EDIT SIMPLIFIED EXPLANATION OF DICE TOWER VIDEOS
PERHAPS START YOUR OWN NEETUP AT A PUBLIC PLACE IF YOU LIKE THOSE WHO SHOW UP GO FROM THERE
ARE YOU OPEN TO SOLO GAMING THERE ARE SOME REALLY GREAT GAMES OUT THERE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BE PLAYED BY ONE PERSON AND YOU CAN PLAY PRACTICALLY ANY CO-OP BOARD GAME SOLO
YEA I'D SAY GIVE NEETUP ANOTHER SHOT FIND PUBLIC PLACE ONES OR IT IS EASY TO MAKE AN EXCUSE TO SNEAK OUT PRETEND TO GET A TEXT AND JUST SAY OH ITS MY KID SORRY I HAVE TO GO

I JOINED A RANDOM FEW GUYS ON A NEETUP AT A HOUSE AND THEY TURNED INTO THE BEST CONSISTENT GROUP I HAVE PLAYED IN PROBABLY PLAYED HUNDREDS OF GAMES WITH THESE GUYS BY NOW
HEY I HAD A VERY SIMILAR ISSUE ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WAS NEW TO BOARDGAMING AND RECONNECTED WITH AN OLD FRIEND WE ENDED UP STARTING OUR OWN GROUP BUT WENT THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS BEFORE WE FOUND WHAT WORKED OUT BEST FOR US

FIRST THING I DID WAS SIGN UP ON THIS WAS BEFORE RECONNECTING WITH MY OLD FRIEND I TRIED IT OUT WAS NOT TO MY LIKING WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE CRAMMED INTO A SMALL SPACE ONCE AT A SMALL BAR AND ONCE AT SOMEONES HOUSE

MY NEXT OPTION WAS GOING TO LOCAL SUBREDDITS IN MY CASE R MICHIGAN AND CITY SPECIFIC ONES NEARBY THROUGH THIS I FOUND A GROUP THAT MET AT A BAR THEY NOW MEET AT A AGS WITH A BAR INSIDE WEEKLY AWESOME GROUP HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU'RE IN SOUTHERN MICHIGAN PM ME AND I'LL PASS THEIR INFO ALONG UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME THEY'RE ROUGHLY MINUTES AWAY SO I GO EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS OR SO

I USED MY FAGS GROUP FINDER FORUMS FOUND A FEW PEOPLE WE MET AT THE AGS A FEW TIMES STILL A MINUTE DRIVE FOR ME THO WE DID ADD ANOTHER MEMBER HERE TO THE FINAL PRODUCT WHO HAD A SIMILAR DRIVE

LAST PLACE I WENT WAS THE BG FORUMS AND LOOKED IN THE AREA SPECIFIC FORUMS HERE I MET THE FINAL PERSON IN MY GROUP WE CHATTED A BIT VIA TEXT AND AGREED TO MEET AT A NEUTRAL PLACE LOCAL COFFEE HOUSE AND PLAY A QUICK GAME MET ALL WAS GOOD AND WE GOT ALONG WELL WE FORMED A GROUP AND NOW ROTATE BETWEEN EVERYONE'S HOUSES FOR GAME DAY OUR GROUP IS PEOPLE DEPENDING ON WHO COMES AND IT WORKS REALLY WELL FOR US

IN THE END I HAD TO LOOK MULTIPLE PLACES BUT I ALSO FOUND A FANTASTIC GROUP OF FRIENDS TO GAME WITH DON'T GET DISCOURAGED KEEP ON LOOKING
REALLY BEEN DIGGING ANIS LATELY MAX OF PLAYERS HAS ZERO POINTS INVOLVED THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT POSSIBLE WINNING CONDITIONS AND THE FIRST TO MEET ONE AND HOLD OFF THE COMPETITION FOR THE REST OF THE ROUND IS THE WINNER WINNING IS ALL ABOUT OUT MANEUVERING AND TAKING THE CARDS FOR ACTIONS OR TO PREVENT ACTIONS TO GET YOU TO VICTORY
MANY COOPERATIVE GAMES LIKE PANDEMIC FORBIDDEN ISLAND AND MARVEL LEGENDARY HAVE CLEAR WIN LOSE CONDITIONS

ALSO A LOT OF TWO PLAYER GAMES WILL HAVE CLEARER WINNERS AND LOSERS WITHOUT THE NEED TO DO POINT THINGS SO NETRUNNER AND BATTLEDORE COME TO MIND BOTH OF WHICH INVOLVE PLAYERS TRYING TO REACH A CERTAIN TARGET FIRST

THE SAME GOES FOR SEVERAL HIDDEN MOVEMENT GAMES WHICH USUALLY END WHEN YOU CATCH THE HIDDEN PLAYER FOR EXAMPLE FURY OF DRACULA AND LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL BOTH CAN HAVE REALLY EXCITING ENDINGS
ARGENT THE CONSORTIUM ENDS EPICALLY IT'S ESSENTIALLY A DASH TO SEE WHO GETS THE MOST VOTES FROM SECRET VOTERS DEPENDING ON CARDS YOU'VE OBTAINED THROUGHOUT THE GAME THE GAME ITSELF IS A BIT COMPLEX BUT IT'S A GREAT ONE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
MOST SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES FIT THIS DESCRIPTION OF HAVING LARGE TRIUMPHANT ENDINGS WITH LOTS OF EMOTION THE RESISTANCE AVALON FOR EXAMPLE
IN CYCLADES IT IS FAIRLY EASY TO SEE WHO'S ON THE VERGE OF WINNING YOU WIN WHEN YOU HAVE 2 POLIS AND IT IS EASY TO DISCERN WHO'S GOING TO BID FOR A CERTAIN GOD OR BUY A CERTAIN MYTHIC CREATURE TO GET A WINNING CONDITION

IT IS A GAME BUT YOU ALSO DO BIDS FOR GOD'S FAVORS AT THE START OF EACH ROUND THE GAME IS REALLY THE BIDDING AND THE DUDES ON THE MAP ITS JUST SORT OF THERE HAVING SAID THAT ITS A GOOD GAME THAT MY GROUP ENJOYS A LOT
IF YOU DON'T WANT POINT COUNTING BUT DON'T MIND AN UNCERTAIN GOAL I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SIERRA MADRE GAMES PAX SERIES

PAX PORFIRIANA THE FIRST SMALL BOX CARD GAME IN THE SERIES THAT WAS BASED OFF OF LORDS OF THE SIERRA MADRE YOU ARE A WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN DURING THE REIGN OF THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT PORFIRIO DIAZ AND HUNGRY FOR A CHANGE ADD YOU BUILD UP ASSETS AND GAIN ALLIES DECIDE WHERE YOU WANT THE COUNTRY TO GO DO YOU BUILD UP LOYALTY TO THE CURRENT REGIME GET THE US TO INTERVENE ATTEMPT TO MANIPULATE THE SYSTEM TO BECOME PRESIDENT OR START A COMMUNIST REVOLUTION COGENT TYPE CARDS COME OUT DURING THE GAME ONE FOR EACH TYPE OF VICTORY IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT IN THAT TYPE OF REVOLUTION

PAX PAMIR YOU ARE A MINOR TRIBE IN THE REGION NOTE KNOWN AS AFGHANISTAN DURING THE GREAT GAME A TIME WHEN THE BRITISH AND RUSSIAN EMPIRES WERE FIGHTING FOR CONTROL OF THE REGION CHOOSE YOUR LOYALTY TO ONE OF THE GREAT POWERS OR THE NATIONALIST MOVEMENT AND TRY TO WIN POLITICALLY WITH AN INTELLIGENCE WAR ECONOMICALLY OR IN A HOT WAR BUT BE CAREFUL BECAUSE THE VICTOR REWARDS ONLY THE MOST LOYAL OF THE TRIBES SO A CUNNING OPPONENT MAY UNDO YOUR HARD WORK BY CURING FAVOR FROM THE GREATER POWER KHUBBER KNIVES ADDS NEW MECHANICS AND EVENTS

PAX RENAISSANCE YOU ARE A RENAISSANCE BANKER SEEKING TO MANIPULATE THE TAPESTRY OF RULERSHIP POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS TO GAIN CONCESSIONS AND ACCUMULATE WEALTH BUILD UP ALLIES IN WESTERN AND EASTERN EUROPE AS YOU WORK TOWARDS ONE OF FOUR MAJOR VICTORY CONDITIONS SUPPORT EXISTING EMPIRES AND HAVE THE MOST FAVOR WITH MONARCHIES THROW IN WITH THE NEW REPUBLICS AND THEIR RULE BY THE PEOPLE SUPPORT THE DOMINANT RELIGION OR GAIN THE MOST CONCESSIONS TO CONTROL TRADE IN A GROWING GLOBALIZED WORLD MANIPULATE THE PEASANTS INTO REVOLT ARRANGE MARRIAGES AND THIS CORONATION TO GAIN FAVOR WITH KINDS MANEUVER PIRATES AND KNIGHTS BUILD FORTS FIND JIHADS AND CRUSADES FUND CONQUESTS FOR KINGS TO VASSALIZE NEIGHBORS WATCH FOR COMETS THAT OPEN UP VICTORY CONDITIONS USE BISHOPS TO SILENCE THE POWERS OF OPPONENTS START GREAT TRADE FAIRS AND KEEP A WARY EYE ON PERMANENTLY SHIFTING TRADE ROUTES IF YOU LIKE HERE I STAND BUT DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY IT THIS IS A GAME TO CHECK OUT AN EXPANSION ADDS MANY NEW CARDS AND A NEW CARD TYPE

ALL ARE GREAT PAX PAMIR IS PROBABLY THE BEST IN TERMS OF SMOOTHNESS OF PLAY AND CLEAREST CARD LAYOUT AND SURPRISINGLY CAN PLAY EASILY IN AN HOUR PAX RENAISSANCE WAS JUST RELEASES AND HAS TAKEN PAMIR S MECHANICS TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND PAX PORFIRIANA WAS THE FIRST IN THE SERIES AND IS TRULY CAPLESS ALL ARE ESSENTIALLY TABLEAU CARD GAMES THAT COME WITH A LARGE DECK OF WHICH YOU USE A SMALL SUBSET LIKE MUST PHIL EKLUND GAMES NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN PLAYERS IS ENCOURAGED BUT AS A PLAYER WHO ISN'T A HUGE FAN OF THIS I FIND THAT THEY WORK WELL WITHOUT ALL THE WHEELING AND DEALING RULE BOOKS ARE USUALLY HARD TO GET THROUGH BECAUSE PHIL PREFERS TO USE THEMATIC OVER CLEAR GAME PLAY TERMS AND BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IN SPLITTING RULES BETWEEN THE MAIN TEXT AND THE GLOSSARY NONE OF THESE ARE VP GAMES BUT YOU DO HAVE TO MANIPULATE THE GAME STATE TOWARDS THE TYPE OF VICTORY YOU WANT AND YOU MIGHT NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY THEY ARE MEATY GAMES PACKED EFFICIENTLY INTO A THE GRIZZLED SIZED BOXES MY FAVORITE IS PROBABLY PAX RENAISSANCE DUE TO THE VARIETY IN PLAY I LIKE THAT YOU CAN GO ON WARS OF CONQUEST OR IGNORE IT AND FOCUS ON TRADE OR RELIGION INSTEAD BUT ALL PRESENT INTERESTING TWIST ON HOW REVOLUTIONS COME ABOUT AND NONE OF THEM HAVE YOU PLAYING THE CLICHED ROLE OF A GREAT POWER THAT PUSHES EVERYONE AROUND YOU'RE ALMOST ALWAYS A LITTLE GUY IN THE SHADOW MANIPULATIONS EVENTS WHILE TRYING TO AVOID GETTING STEEPED ON BY GIANTS
HAS THAT GLORIOUS FEELING OF VICTORY YOU EITHER KILL ALL THE OTHER WIZARDS OR BE THE FIRST TO STEAL 2 TREASURES AND GET THEM TO YOUR HOME BASE

MAYBE A RACE TO THE FINISH KIND OF GAME LIKE FORMULA D HARE AND TORTOISE AND MISSISSIPPI QUEEN

OR A RACE TO BE THE FIRST TO COMPLETE A GOAL LIKE CAN'T STOP DAYS IN THE USA OR NIAGARA
I WISH I HAD SOME MORE GAMES THAT ENDED LIKE THIS MYSELF THIS IS ONE THING CATAN NAILS REALLY WELL MOST GAMES YOU'RE NEVER EXACTLY SURE WHEN THE GAME IS GOING TO END A FEW HIDDEN VICTORY POINTS REALLY ADDS NICE SUSPENSE

I DISAGREE ABOUT LEWIS CLARK THOUGH IF YOU'RE PRETTY FAR BEHIND LOOKING AT THAT RACE TRACK CAN BE REALLY DEMORALIZING
EUPHORIA IS A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME THAT'S THE RACE TO PLACE ALL OF YOUR STARS ON THE BOARD BEAUTIFUL COMPONENTS AND SEVERAL UNIQUE MECHANICS IN A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME

ALIEN FRONTIERS IS A SCI-FI DICE PLACEMENT GAME THAT'S A RACE TO POINTS THE POINTS ARE ALL PUBLIC SO THE END CAN GET VERY CUT THROAT SUFFERS FROM POTENTIAL STRATEGY GAME

CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD IS A BLOODY ASYMMETRIC DUDES ON A MAP GAME WHERE EACH FACTION CAN WIN BY ADVANCING IT'S DIAL IN UNIQUE WAYS OR THROUGH POINTS AWARDED EACH ROUND EACH FACTION FEELS VERY DIFFERENT NOT ALL POSSIBLE PLAYER NUMBERS ARE RECOMMENDED AS CERTAIN FACTION COMBINATIONS ARE IMBALANCE

CARCASSONNE IS THE PROTOTYPICAL CLASSIC GATEWAY GAME VERY SIMPLE LIGHT STRATEGY CONTINUOUS SCORING GAME ENDS WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF TILES

COUP LAST ONE STANDING SIMPLE GAME GREAT FILLER GAME

FORMULA D RACING GAME IT'S OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUS WHO'S WINNING BECAUSE THEY'RE IN FRONT VERY LIGHT COOL DICE CHUCKING GAME
POWERGRID
WHEN YOU LIGHT OP THE MOST HOUSES IT'S GLORIOUS
POWERGRID HAS A VERY CLEAR ENDING
GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME HAS A CLEAR ENDING AND IT IS BASED ON BOARD POSITIONING AND STRATEGIC AREA CONTROL IT IS EVEN CLEARLY MARKED ON A TRACK THE BUILDUP IN THE FIRST HALF SO YOU CAN CARRY OUT STRATEGIES AND RUIN OTHERS HAVE YOURS RUINED IN THE SECOND HALF MAKES FOR AN EPIC ENDING EVERYTIME AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO THROW THEIR BID BEHIND ONE OF PLAYERS WHO ARE VERY CLOSE TO AN ENDING USUALLY OF THE PLAYERS ARE NOT SETUP FOR A WINNING MOVE IN THE LAST ROUND BUT I HAVE PLAYED 2 GAMES WHERE PEOPLE WERE WITHIN CAPTURING ONE STRONGHOLD TO WIN IN THE LAST ROUND SUDDENLY THE PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT WIN AREN'T OUT OF THE GAME BUT ARE IMPORTANT AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE END GAME AS WELL HAVEN'T PLAYED A GAME WHERE THERE WAS PILE ON THE LEADER BECAUSE OF THE INTRIGUE AND BETRAYAL UP TO THAT POINT CAUSES FACTIONS SO THE WHOLE GROUP NEVER BANDS TOGETHER TO DETHRONE ONE PLAYER TO LET ANOTHER PLAYER RUN AWAY WITH IT

I LOVE THIS GAME SO I'M GOING TO STOP BLABBERING NOW
IF YOU WANT COOP GAMES WITH SOME GOOD STORIES TO TELL ABOUT THAT ONE TIME YOU WERE THIS CLOSE OR HOW YOU MANAGED TO PULL OFF A NARROW WIN I WOULD SAY ELDRITCH HORROR GRANTED THE GAME WORKS BEST WITH THE EPACTS SO KEEP THAT IN MIND

WE STILL TALK ABOUT CERTAIN GAMES OF THAT AND ITS OLDER BROTHER MARKHAM HORROR LIKE HEY REMEMBER WHEN YOU GOT THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND SAT IN THE SILVER TWILIGHT LODGE ALL GAME AND SHAPED THE GAME FOR US OR REMEMBER WHEN WE GOT PROMISES OF POWER TO FLIP ON THE SAME TURN LETTING US COME BACK FROM A SURE LOSS
A SIMPLE GAME BUT MACHI BORO IS A LIGHT GAME THAT FITS THIS YOU HAVE FOUR LANDMARKS THAT YOU NEED TO BUILD WITH ESCALATING COSTS AND YOU CAN ONLY BUILD ONE LANDMARK PER TURN FROM THERE IT'S A MATTER OF WATCHING PLAYERS BUILD UP THEIR MONEY STORES AND BLOW THE MONEY ON A LANDMARK AGAIN AND AGAIN
SOME OF THE MOST INTENSE VICTORIES FOR ME HAVE BEEN FROM REAL-TIME DEXTERITY GAMES LIKE FUSE OR ESCAPE MANY TIMES IT COMES DOWN TO SECONDS ON THE CLOCK AND MY HEART LITERALLY RACES AS WE'RE TRYING TO FINISH THE LAST OBJECTIVES
MUNCHKIN
ALLOW ME TO PASS THIS TIP FORWARD

THIS BAG WHILE DESIGNED FOR A LARGE SQUARE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT IS BASICALLY DESIGNED PERFECTLY FOR ANYONE WANTING TO CARRY A NUMBER OF BOARD GAMES IT HAS SHOULDER STRAPS THAT ARE PERFECT AND UNZIPPING THE FRONT PANEL TO REVEAL ALL THE GAMES INSIDE IS TOO COOL

BAGS FROM IKEA THEY HOLD STANDARD SIZE GAMES EASILY

GYM BAG CAN HOLD MOST GAMES BUT NOTHING WITH BIG BOXES
I DON'T YET HAVE ONE OF THESE BUT SAVED IT AFTER A SIMILAR CONVERSATION SOME MONTHS BACK ON AMAZON AND LOOKS PRETTY STURDY AND SIZABLE

GO TO YOUR LOCAL WALMART FIND THEIR LUGGAGE SECTION LOOK FOR A DUFFLE BAG BY THE BRAND ORBEN IT WILL RUN YOU MAYBE CAN HOLD REGULAR GAME BOXES AND SOME SMALLER ONES TUCKED IN AND THEY DON'T JOSTLE AROUND IF YOU AREN'T RECKLESS STUFF SOME CLOTHES IN WITH THE BAG AND IT WORKS EVEN BETTER IT HAS WHEELS ONE OF THOSE LITTLE ARMS AND IT'S A BAG YOU CAN ALSO USE FOR TRAVELING WITHOUT BOARD GAMES AND LOOK COMPLETELY NORMAL ORBEN BAGS BEST LUGGAGE PURCHASE I'VE MADE SINCE I MOVED OUT OF MY PARENTS PLACE
US EN CATALOG PRODUCTS ART
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME THE DRAW OF THIS GAME IS IT JUST THE ARTWORK STORY MINIATURES OR IS THE ACTUAL GAMEPLAY GOOD MY EXPOSURE TO KD M IS BASICALLY THROUGH VARIOUS REDDIN POSTS ITS OFFICIAL WEBSITE AND THIS KICKSTARTER IN PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THAT THERE IS BARELY ANY MENTION OF GAMEPLAY MECHANICS I CONTRAST THIS TO SOMETHING LIKE GLOOMHAVEN WHERE THERE ARE JUST STANDEES FOR MONSTERS BUT FUN NEW MECHANICS LIKE COMBAT LEGACY ELEMENTS ETC IT'S JUST VERY STRANGE TO ME THAT THIS GAME IS SO POPULAR YET NOBODY EVER TALKS ABOUT WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS OTHER THAN A CLAPTON OF DETAILED MINIATURES

I SHOULD NOTE I'VE NOT ACTIVELY GONE LOOKING FOR MORE INFORMATION I REALIZE I COULD PROBABLY FIND A RUN-THROUGH SOMEWHERE THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT I'M MORE INTERESTED IN WHY EVERYONE ELSE THINKS ITS GOOD
I DO SOME RATING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND THE AVERAGE FOR THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLY HIGH WITH QUITE A SMALL STANDARD DEVIATION

I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER HOW MUCH BEING INCREDIBLY HEAVILY VESTED IN THE GAME INFLUENCES PEOPLE'S RATINGS
IF I WAS A SINGLE MAN I WOULD BACK THIS BUT THERE IS ZERO CHANCE I CAN EXPLAIN THIS TO MY WIFE AND SOUND JUSTIFIED
SO WAIT THIS IS NOT THE CORE GAME UNTIL PLEDGE
I GOT INTO THE SATAN PLEDGE RIP
THEY BUMPED THE TIER NUMBERS FROM TO IT LOOKS LIKE
SAW FOR THE BASE GAME
RETREATED TO THE CORNER TO CRY MANY TEARS
WHAT IS THE CHEST AND IS IT WORTH THE EXTRA LOOKS LIKE THEY ROLLED PHILOSOPHY OF DEATH IS THAT THE ONLY ONE OR WILL MORE BE ADDED TO CHEST
MILLION HOLY SHIT DUDE WAS FREAKING OUT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED THAT FIRST UPDATE SO CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HE'S GOING TO FEEL SOON
AS OF RIGHT NOW PEOPLE HAVE PLEDGED FOR THE LEVEL YOU GUYS ARE INSANE YOU COULD FILL A CLOSET WITH GREAT TOP TIER GAMES FOR THAT MUCH
GOD HELP ME
FOR SOMEONE LIVING IN BRAZIL THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
JUST BROKE IN MIN THAT'S INSANE

SAY WHAT YOU WILL BUT BETTER THIS MAKING MILLION THAN BEARS AND BABIES OR WHATEVER
THE BLACK FRIDAY LANTERN IS ALREADY SOLD OUT IS THERE A RUSH TO ORDER IF I JUST WANT TO BUY THE CORE GAME IT'S RIGHT NOW WILL THAT CHANGE OR CAN I WAIT A MONTH
I'M LOVING THE PINUP MALES ABOUT TIME WE GET THESE
DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS
IS THE SHIP DATE REALLY
NO REAL REASON TO BACK NOW ALL THE LIMITED TIERS ARE GONE EXCEPT FOR UPGRADE MIGHT AS WELL WAIT THE DAYS AND SEE WHERE IT LANDS
THIS IS A GREAT GAME BUT IT'S NOT FOR ME THE ONLY THING THIS GAME HAS GOING FOR IT IS THAT IT IS HUGE GAME MECHANISMS THEMSELVES ARE NOT UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT AND ARE AT TIMES EVEN BLOATED I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS TOO LONG FOR WHAT IT IS

IF ANYONE LOOKS FOR A GAME THAT GIVES A SIMILAR FEEL TO THIS GAME IN TERMS OF PUNISHING SURVIVAL GAMEPLAY BUT DOES NOT HAVE MINIATURES TAKE A LOOK AT ASSAULT ON DOOMROCK IT MAY ALSO BE DIFFICULT TO FIND BY NOW THOUGH IT'S STILL AVAILABLE IN EUROPE

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE DOOMROCK AND THOUGH IT DOESN'T HAVE A CAMPAIGN SYSTEM EVERY TIME IT'S ON TABLE HAS BEEN A TENSE COOPERATIVE THRILLER
NOT A CHANCE
I CAN THANKFULLY SAY I AM VIRTUALLY UNABLE TO BUY INTO KD EVEN IF I WANTED TO SPEND EVERYTHING I HAD


WAIT SHIT
DFW LANTERN
SORRY IF THIS HAS BEEN ASKED ALREADY THE LINK MENTIONS BLACK FRIDAY DOES IT MEAN THAT PRICES THEY'RE ASKING FOR WILL INCREASE
DOES THE TIER INCLUDE ALL THE EXISTING CONTENT

ALSO HOW DOES THIS PLAY WITH 2
WASN'T GOING TO BACK IT BUT GOT THE DOLLAR CORE SET

FIGURE THERE'S AT LEAST 2 NIGHTS IN THE PUB WORTH OF ENTERTAINMENT IN THE BOX IF I EVER GET BORED OF IT I CAN SELL IT FOR TIMES WHAT I PAID
I CAN'T BELIEVE I BOUGHT THIS JUST NOW THANKS A LOT U GETTHERETHENREST LOL
WELP I JUST BACKED THE BASE GAME BLIND SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF INSANITY I'M SEEING ABOUT THIS REPRINT I ASSUME THAT WORST CASE I CAN SELL IT LATER AND GET MY MONEY BACK

MY QUESTION IS IN REGARDS TO EXPANSIONS HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO BUY THEM AFTER THE FACT IF I DECIDE I WANT THEM DEBATING ON WHETHER OR NOT TO JUST PULL THE TRIGGER ON THE FULL FOR ALL OF THE NEW EXPANSIONS RATHER THAN THE I'VE ALREADY SPENT FOR THE BASE GAME
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW REASONABLE IT WOULD BE TO PICK UP THE EXPANSIONS IN THE FUTURE I COULD JUSTIFY UP FRONT FOR THE CORE GAME BUT NOT FOR EVERYTHING IF I COULD GET THE EXPANSIONS OVER TIME THOUGH THEN THAT'D BE MUCH MORE REASONABLE
I NOTICE THE EXPANSIONS ARE ON THEIR OFFICIAL WEBSITE AS OF THIS MOMENT I JUST PLEDGED THE CORE GAME FOR THEIR KICKSTARTER SHOULD I BUY ANY OF THE EXPANSION SETS IF SO WHICH ONE
THIS GAME WILL NOW CLIMB WELL ONTO BG TOP AND DO EVEN BETTER THAN IT HAS BEFORE I AM EXCITED TO SEE HOW THIS CONTINUES GO BOOTS
CAN YOU ONLY GET THE OLD EXPANSIONS THROUGH THE ANCIENT LANTERN PLEDGE YOU THINK I CAN'T TELL IF THERE IS A WAY TO ADD THEM ON WITHOUT PICKING THAT ONE
GETTING CLOSE TO BREAKING IN UNDER MINS
MY GOD THESE MINIS ARE INSANE SO TEMPTED
HONEST QUESTION

DOES ANYONE CONSIDER IT TO BE WORTH IT EVEN WITHOUT THE MINIS AS IN THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO PURCHASE THIS IF IT HAD NO MINIS

I AM ALMOST CONSIDERING GOING ALL IN JUST FOR THE MINIS AND RESELLING IT TO SOMEONE WHO JUST WANTS THE PURE GAME NO MINIS MAYBE THEY CAN PRINT OUT SOMETHING FOR STAND INS

IF SO WHAT WOULD PEOPLE VALUE THE HIGHEST PLEDGE AT WITH NO MINIS LANTERN

SO I PLEDGED FOR BLACK FRIDAY LANTERN 2ND FACE SO I KNOW I AM COVERED FOR ALL THE NEW EXPANSIONS I ALSO GOT ALL THE OTHER AVAILABLE EXPANSIONS ON THEIR WEBSITE I WONDER IF YOU CAN GET SINGLE ITEMS OF THE PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS ADDED DURING PM
QUESTION WILL THE ALL CURRENT EXPANSIONS DRAGON KING FLOWER KNIGHT ETC LISTED IN ANCIENT GOLD LANTERN PLEDGE LEVELS STILL BE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE

I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BUY THEM ALL NOW BUT I WILL VERY PROBABLY WANT TO BUY THEM ALL AT SOME POINT WITHOUT PAYING EVEN MORE THROUGH THE NOSE
CAN I JUST HAVE A STANDEE VERSION FOR I DON'T DO MINIS SOUNDS LIKE SUCH A COOL GAME
SUCCESSFULLY FUNDED IN LITERALLY UNDER MINUTES I'LL HAVE TO CHECK THE OFFICIAL DATA WHEREVER THAT IS

INSANE ALREADY AT AND IT'S ONLY BEEN LIVE FOR MINUTES
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE GAMBLERS CHEST FOR ME
PARDON MY IGNORANCE BUT THE ORIGINAL VERSION NEVER RECEIVED A RETAIL VERSION CORRECT I'M CONSIDERING BACKING BUT I'M TRYING TO REASON OUT THE BEST TIER TO SUPPORT IF THIS WILL BE MY ONLY SHOT AT GETTING EXPANSIONS
GOT IN FOR BLACK FRIDAY GOLD ALATERN BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL KEEP IT MONEY IS TIGHT AND GLOOM HAVEN IS COMING EARLY NEXT YEAR ANYWAY
I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS GAME A FEW MONTHS AGO TOO LATE TO BUY EVEN A MARKET COPY FROM THEIR WEBSITE AND KNEW IMMEDIATELY UPON SEEING IT THAT IT WAS SOMETHING I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED TO OWN SO EXCITED TO GET THIS CHANCE
I JUST MENTIONED THIS TO MY WIFE AND WHAT THE MECHANICS ARE LIKE AND THAT THE KICKSTARTER RAISED 3M SHE'S GLARING AT ME I WISH I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS THING
INTERESTING TO SEE THE PRICES TIERS SO MUCH FOR THE FOLKS HOPING IT WOULD BE AGAIN
BAH I WAS TRYING TO SAVE MONEY AND THIS WAS ON MY WANT LIST
1ST WAVE EXPANSIONS ARE ALSO DISCOUNTED ON THE MAIN STORE WHAT IS MORE INTERESTING

WAITING FOR THEM TO SHOW UP AS EXPANSIONS IN THE KICKSTARTER AND GET THEM ALONG THE KS

BUY THEM NOW DISCOUNTED AND POSSIBLY WITHOUT OVERSEAS TAXES
MUCH APPRECIATED GOT IN BEFORE THE DESIRED TIER FILLED UP
ANYONE KNOW IF THE BLACK FRIDAY NINJA MINI IS PART OF THE PROMOS THAT WILL BE WITH THE SATAN TIER
SO I HAVE THE BLACK FRIDAY LANTERN RIGHT NOW DEPENDING ON WHAT IS ON THE CHEST LATER TODAY I MIGHT BE ABANDONING THAT FOR THE GOLD LANTERN IS THERE ANYTHING I SHOULD BE TRYING TO GET RIGHT NOW SINCE THE KINGDOM DEATH STORE HAS THE HALF OFF SALE THAT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET LATER LIKE THE WET NURSE IS ONLY INSTEAD OF ARE THESE SORTS OF THINGS GOING TO BE OKAY TO GET LATER AND HOW WELL DO THEY FIT INTO THE GAME
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THIS

AT IT SAYS CORE GAMBLER ALL CURRENT EXPANSIONS
AT IT SAYS CORE GAMBLER EXPANSIONS PROMOS PINUPS FROM THIS KICKSTARTER CURRENTLY 2 AND A T SHIRT

WHY IS IT NEARLY MORE FOR A LOT LESS STUFF
THIS SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING BUT IT'S WAY OUT OF MY PRICE RANGE ARE THERE ANY GOOD OF CAMPAIGNS PEOPLE HAVE RUN I'D LIKE TO EXPERIENCE IT VICARIOUSLY
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW LONG WE WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO PURCHASE THIS GAME IT'S HIGH UP ON MY WISELIEST BUT MY WIFE AND I WON'T BE IN A PLACE FINANCIALLY TO DROP ON A GAME UNTIL PROBABLY 2 YEARS FROM NOW
OPEN SPOTS IN BLACK FRIDAY GOLD LANTERN OPENED IT UP TO BACKERS
OK JUST BACKED THIS AT THE LEVEL AFTER ONLY HEARING ABOUT THIS GAME YESTERDAY WHAT HAVE I DONE
AS LONG AS MY F DOESN'T FIND OUT I'M FINE
THE BLACK FRIDAY GOLD LANTERN KEEPS GETTING OPENED UP WHILE I AM ASLEEP AND I KEEP MISSING THE DAMNED THING I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO HAVE AN ALARM GO OFF WHEN IT OPENED UP OR SOMETHING
I'M THINKING ABOUT JUMPING ON BOARD THIS KICKSTARTER BUT NEED TO KNOW IF THIS IS A GAME THAT IS FUN SOLO IT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY WAY I WILL PLAY THIS GAME
JUST SNEAKED INTO A BLACK FRIDAY LANTERN PLEDGE FOR DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THIS GAME APPEALS TO ME ON A DEEP LEVEL
MY ONLY REGRET WISH WAS THAT THERE WERE COPIES SANS MINIATURES BUT THAT'S OK
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE HYPE FOR THIS I'M NOT SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING
LOOKS LIKE A SUCCESS SO FAR

BACKERS
PLEDGED OF GOAL
BACKERS AT THE LEVEL

IT MUST BE NICE TO HAVE MONEY MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT SOMETIME AROUND THE SUMMER OF I WILL FIND A COPY AT A THRIFT STORE OR GARAGE SALE
OFF FOR EARLY BIRD

FUCK

THAT
THEY'RE ADDING MORE SLOTS TO THE BLACK FRIDAY LANTERN DEALS JUST A HEADS UP
BOOTS JUST DEALT A SERIOUS WOUND TO MY BANK ACCOUNT ANYONE GOT THE WOUND TABLE TO ROLL ON FOR THAT
FUCK THAT'S EXPENSIVE AND I THOUGHT COOL MINI OR NOT WAS A LOT FOR FOR MOST CAMPAIGNS
WELP BETTER UP MY PAINTING SKILLS
I'VE ALREADY INVESTED IN PANDEMONIUM DEEP MADNESS AND MYTHIC BATTLES PANTHEON THIS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME UNIQUE TO BUY INTO ANOTHER MINIATURE BASED GAME WHAT'S THE APPEAL OF THIS ONE
SO IF I WANT TO GET THE MOST OF THIS KICKSTARTER WHILE SPENDING THE LEAST MONEY WHAT WOULD YOU GUYS RECOMMEND
SINCE IT LOOKS LIKE THE MINIS GET CUSTOMIZED BASED ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CAMPAIGN HOW DOES REPLAYING WORK DO I JUST HAVE TO PRETEND HE HAS AN AXE OR WHATEVER EVEN THOUGH I RUBBER CEMENTED A SWORD IN LAST TIME AND SAME THING FOR THE DIFFERENT HEADS DO I GET TO JUST CHOOSE THAT ONCE OR DOES IT NOT WORK LIKE THAT
HOW DOES THIS GAME PLAY SOLO
NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET A CHANCE AT THIS GAME


EXPANSION OR NO EXPANSIONS


ALL SLOTS FOR BLACK FRIDAY ARE DONE FOR


ALSO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE GAMBLER CHEST WOULD UNVEIL I SEE STRETCH GOALS WERE BLOWN THOUGH ALREADY BUT MAYBE THE AND THE KS EXCLUSIVE EXPANSIONS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHICH WILL THOSE BE
DEFINITELY GOING TO BACK THE BASE AND POSSIBLY THE GAMBLERS UPGRADE BUT ALTHOUGH EXPANSIONS WOULD BE COOL I REEEAAALLLY DONT KNOW HOW TO JUSTIFY OVER ON EXPANSIONS ALONE WHEN THAT MONEY COULD BUY LIKE ABSOLUTELY AWESOME GAMES INSTEAD
THIS LOOKS AMAZING

JUST FOR CLARITY WHAT IS THE MINIMUM PLEDGE LEVEL TO GET THE ENTIRE GAME THIS LOOKS AWESOME SO I'M INTERESTED BUT I'D WANT EVERYTHING BASE GAME AND EXPANSIONS
UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO DROP OUT I'M TRYING TO SAVE UP FOR A NINTENDO SWITCH AND BE SOMEWHAT FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE A LOT OF GAMES AS IS

IT LOOKS SUPER COOL AND I'LL SEE ABOUT GETTING IN IF THEY EVER DO A BUT FOR NOW MY BANK ACCOUNT IS EMACIATED ENOUGH
WHAT IS UP WITH THAT NAME

TO ME IT READS LIKE UNITED STATES BEAR

AM I MISSING SOMETHING DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO OTHER PEOPLE
AND PEOPLE WERE COMPLAINING THAT CTHULHU WARS WAS TOO EXPENSIVE
I AM GLAD THAT THIS GUYS ARE OFFERING HIGH QUALITY FIGURES AND THE GAME SEEMS PRETTY COOL

I AM ALSO GLAD I CANNOT AFFORD IT AT THE MOMENT AND THAT WAITING UNTIL DECEMBER IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TIME TO WAIT FOR IT
THIS DUDE NEEDS TO GO ON SHARK TANK HE'D EASILY LAND A DEAL AND BE ABLE TO MASS PRODUCE
THOSE PRICES OVER PER GAME EVEN AT RETAIL LEVEL
TOOK ME SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO GET MY PLEDGE IN KEPT GETTING ERRORS PROBABLY FROM THE INSANE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE HITTING THIS THE BLACK FRIDAY PLEDGE LEVEL IS ALMOST GONE MILLION IN LESS THAN MINUTES CRAZY
GOT MY PLEDGE IN WOO GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE TRYING TO PLEDGE
OME IS THE SHIPPING TO SINGAPORE REALLY
THE RETAIL VERSION IS JUST THE BASE GAME AT THE RETAIL PRICE

I'M PUZZLED
STILL TOO BLOODY EXPENSIVE
I KNOW IT'S SHIPPED IN WAVES BUT IS A CRAZY AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THIS MAKES NO SENSE SINCE HE DOES HAVE MOST OF THE MOLDS READY

IS BOOTS STILL BEING A CONTROL FREAK WANTING TO DO EVERYTHING HIMSELF HE REALLY NEEDS TO HIRE PEOPLE

IS THAT DEC DATE REAL PLEASE GOD NUMBER I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF PATIENCE
THAT EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE HOLY SHIT
THIS VIDEO ISN'T ALL THAT HELPFUL AS TO HOW THE GAME PLAYS BUT IT'S PRETTY ENTERTAINING
OKAY SO FOR SOMEONE WHO HASN'T PLAYED A TABLETOP MINIATURES GAME WHICH SET OR SHOULD I SAY WHICH EIR SHOULD I BACK UP TO GET A GOOD EXPERIENCE IF I PLAN ON BUYING EXPANSIONS AND WHAT NOT AS I GO I REALLY WANT TO GET INTO SOMETHING LIKE THIS JUST HAVE NO CLUE ABOUT WHAT I NEED TO PLAY IT I DONT HAVE ANY SETS AS WELL
M ALREADY I'LL BET THAT CORE GAME GETS DELAYED BY MONTHS ONCE HE'S COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED BY THE DEMAND TO PRINT AND SEND TIMES MORE GAMES THAN HE EXPECTED AND PLANNED FOR SOME PARTS IS CRAZY YOUR GRANDKIDS WILL GET THOSE
MY GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE
I HAVE THE ORIGINAL I STILL HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET THOUGH

IS THERE A WAY TO UPGRADE IT TO THE NEW RULESET BEFORE I PLAY
SHIPS IN DEC IS THAT REALLY HOW LONG BACKERS HAVE TO WAIT EDIT JUST READ A COMMENT ABOUT CORE GAME IN SORRY
WAITING YEARS ABSOLUTELY KILLS IT FOR ME I'VE ALREADY WAITED YEARS ON ROBOTECH
SO LAST CAMPAIGN CORE GAME WAS BUT NOW IS

CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE DECEMBER SHIP DATE WTF ARE THEY SCULPTING EACH MODEL BY HAND
ESTIMATED DELIVERY DEC
DELIVERY DEC
ESTIMATED SHIPPING DECEMBER
SOUNDS FUN HOW MUCH FOR THE BASE GAME OK SEEMA LATER

FOR A GAME THAT WON'T SHIP UNTIL AND IT HAS OVER 2 MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR WHAT DON'T I KNOW ABOUT THIS GAME HOW THE HELL IS IT SO POPULAR AND I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT HELP
AGAIN THIS WAS A KICKSTARTER OFFER LAST YEAR
ESTIMATED DELIVERY DEC

YEARS FROM NOW
EXACTLY WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
LOOKING FOR A BOARD GAME TO BRING TO THE FAMILY OVER CHRISTMAS AND GETTING BORED OF THE NEVER ENDING SAGAS

COMPLETELY NEW TO ALL THESE BOARDGAMES REALLY EXCITED TO GET A COUPLE
THANKS THIS IS A GREAT LIST
GREAT JOB ON THE LIST I'LL BE USING IT TO GRAB A FEW BOARDGAMES FOR FRIEND'S KIDS
IS IT BAD THAT I OWN ALL THESE
INSANELY GREAT LIST TROUBLE IS MY FAMILY ALREADY OWNS MOST OF THESE
THAT'S A GREAT LIST THE ONLY CHANGES I WOULD MAKE IS REMOVING DOMINION AND REPLACING FORBIDDEN ISLAND WITH FORBIDDEN DESERT
GREAT LIST HAS ANYONE GOT ANY FURTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR SLIGHTLY YOUNGER KIDS

I HAVE TWO NEPHEWS AND WHO BOTH LOVE BOARD GAMES THE OLDER ONE IS PRETTY ADVANCED AND LOVES STUFF LIKE FORBIDDEN DESERT CARCASSONNE ETC I'M GOING TO GET HIM PANDEMIC THE YOUNGER ONE STRUGGLES WITH ANYTHING TOO STRATEGIC LAST YEAR I GOT HIM ZOMBIE DICE AND HE LOVED IT BUT I'M STRUGGLING FOR IDEAS THIS YEAR

THEY'VE ALREADY GOT KING OF TOKYO HOKKAIDO TRURO AND LABYRINTH
I OWN BOTH OF THESE GAMES FIRST OF ALL I THINK BOTH ARE EXCELLENT AND BOTH ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT

EXPERIENCE OF OWNING PLAYING

I THINK THIS IS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM SO I'LL START HERE MOM IS A PERFECTLY GOOD STANDALONE GAME IT HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A RUN OF EXPANSIONS BUT THEY'LL PROBABLY COME OUT EVERY MONTHS SO THE DYNAMIC OF THE SCENARIOS CHANGING WILL BE SLOWER THAN AHLCG WHICH ALSO HAS A GREAT CORE SET EXPERIENCE BUT WILL HAVE EXPANSIONS EVERY MONTH WITH NEW PACKS COMING OUT THIS MEANS IT'S A CONSTANTLY EVOLVING SYSTEM WITH MOM YOU'LL BUY THE CORE GAME EXPANSION PLAY THE NEW SCENARIO S AND THEN SPEND THE NEXT FEW MONTHS PLAYING THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH AHLCG YOU'LL DO THE SAME BUT YOU'LL BE GETTING A NEW SCENARIO EVERY MONTH

THE OTHER KEY DIFFERENCE IS THAT BOTH OFFER A LIFESTYLE GAME EXPERIENCE IN DIFFERENT WAYS AHLCG LENDS ITSELF TO THIS MORE NATURALLY WITH EXPANSIONS EVERY MONTH AND IT BEING A CARD GAME YOU'LL WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND IT WILL BE QUICK AND EASY TO DO SO YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT STORAGE SLEEVES BINDERS ETC MOM WILL BE LESS SO BUT CAN OFFER THE HOBBY ASPECT OF PAINTING ALL THE MINIATURES SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT PLAYING YOU CAN BE PAINTING

PRICE

INITIAL OUTLAY IS ROUGHLY SIMILAR AS MOM IS A BIG BOX GAME AND AHLCG IS GOING TO BE CORE SET PLUS SLEEVES AHLCG WILL PROBABLY MORE EXPENSIVE ULTIMATELY BECAUSE IT'LL HAVE MORE CONTENT OVER THE YEARS BUT WILL BE MORE AFFORDABLE AT ONLY PER MONTH FOR EACH PACK AND EVERY MONTHS FOR A DELUXE EXPANSION MOM ON THE OTHER HAND WILL HAVE LESS FREQUENT EXPANSIONS BUT WILL BE FAR MORE EXPENSIVE EACH TIME AT AND MAY SEEM LIKE LESS VALUE CONTAINING ONLY A FEW MINIS CARDS AND TILES

REPLACEABILITY

DESPITE ONLY CONTAINING SCENARIOS I THINK YOU CAN GET PLENTY OF PLAYTIME FROM THE MOM BASE GAME I THINK YOU CAN PLAY EACH SCENARIO TIMES EXPLORE DIFFERENT PLAYER COUNTS AND INVESTIGATORS BEFORE YOU'LL FEEL THAT YOU'VE EXHAUSTED ALL THE CONTENTION HAVING SAID THAT I THINK THE DIFFERENT INVESTIGATORS WHILST HAVING DIFFERENT STATS AND ABILITIES DON'T PLAY MASSIVELY DIFFERENTLY FROM ONE ANOTHER THE EXPANSIONS CONTAIN NEW SCENARIO

AHLCG CORE SET IS SIMILAR WITH SCENARIOS AND YOU CAN PLAY EACH ONE TIMES BEFORE YOU'VE EXPLORED ALL OF THE MAIN NARRATIVE BEATS AND FORKS IN THE PATHOLOGY EACH INVESTIGATOR PLAYS VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM EACH OTHER THEREFORE GIVING MORE REPLACEABILITY YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT PLAYER COUNTS AND DIFFICULTY SETTINGS TO TRY OUT TOO

CAMPAIGN VS STANDALONE

ULTIMATELY AHLCG FEELS FAR MORE LIKE AN RPG THAN MOM BECAUSE YOUR CHARACTER DECK LEVELS UP OVER TIME AND THE SCENARIOS ARE LINKED TOGETHER INTO A CAMPAIGN THE SCOPE OF THE SCENARIOS IS POTENTIALLY WIDER THAN MOM TOO SINCE THEY CAN CONCEIVABLY BE SET ANYWHERE WHEREAS MOM BY DEFINITION IS SOMEWHAT TIED TO MANSIONS

IN MOM EACH SCENARIO IS COMPLETELY STANDALONE THERE IS NO CAMPAIGN MODE AND THERE'S NO PROGRESSION FOR YOUR INVESTIGATOR

GAMEPLAY LENGTH

MOM IS GENERALLY FASTER AND EASIER TO SET UP BUT THE GAME ITSELF WILL TAKE LONGER DEPENDING ON PLAYER COUNT YOU CAN CRACK OUT A SCENARIO OF AHLCG IN MINS MOM SCENARIOS CAN GO TO HOURS OR SO

IMMERSION AND NARRATIVE

I THINK MOM IS QUITE A BIT MORE IMMERSIVE YOU'VE GOT THE MINIS THE MAP TILES THE SOUND EFFECTS VOICE ACTING DM TEXT FROM THE APP ETC AND IT'S LESS ABSTRACTED BECAUSE OF ALL THAT TOO THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT AHLCG ISN'T IMMERSIVE THOUGH I THINK MOM MIGHT HAVE A STRONGER NARRATIVE TOO IN EACH SCENARIO BECAUSE IT HAS MORE TOOLS TO PORTRAY IT BUT I THINK THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN MOM THAT NARRATIVE OFTEN JUST HAPPENS TO YOU IN AHLCG YOU HAVE MORE AGENCY IN SHAPING THE NARRATIVE

GAMEPLAY ITSELF

MOM IS MUCH MORE OF AN EXPERIENCE GAME THE GAME SORT OF HAPPENS TO YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE AGONISING DECISIONS THERE'S NOT MUCH STRATEGY OR TACTICS HAPPENING AHLCG IS FAR MORE GAMEY YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK STRATEGY WHEN MAKING YOUR DECK AT THE START OF A CAMPAIGN AND DURING GAMEPLAY YOUR DECISIONS HAVE FAR MORE WEIGHT AND MATTER MORE

GAME NIGHT OR GAMING BUDDY

ULTIMATELY I THINK THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE AS I DESCRIBED AT THE TOP IS THAT MOM LENDS ITSELF FAR BETTER TO THE GAME NIGHT YOU'VE GOT FRIENDS OVER THAT HAVE OR HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BEFORE YOU CAN CRACK IT OUT AND HAVE FUN YOU'RE NOT WORRYING ABOUT TEACHING THE GAME YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE OPTIMISING THEIR PLAY AND YOU'RE NOT HAVING TO GET THEM BACK NEXT WEEK TO CARRY ON THE CAMPAIGN

AHLCG LENDS ITSELF TO A DEDICATED GAMING PARTNER S THAT JUMPS IN WITH YOU YOU'LL BE THUMBING THROUGH CARDS MAKING DECKS AND THEN TAKING A CRACK AT A CAMPAIGN OF SCENARIOS PRESUMABLY OVER A FEW WEEKS SESSIONS

I PLAYED BOTH QUITE A BIT AND THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT GAMES THERE ARE THREE DECIDING FACTORS TO KEEP IN MIND PRICE DIFFICULTY AND LENGTH MANSIONS IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE ALTHOUGH MAYBE IN THE LONG RUN CHEAPER IT IS AN VERY EASY GAME THAT YOU CAN JUST GRAB WITH A FRIEND OR TWO AND RUN A GAME AFTER MIN OF EXPLANATION REALLY BUT THE LENGTH OF MANSIONS IS A LOT LONGER COMPARED TO A SCENARIO OF MARKHAM CG MANSIONS MIGHT HAVE BIT MORE REPLACEABILITY THEN MARKHAM CG BUT IT MIGHT HIT THE TABLE A BIT LESS BECAUSE OF LONG GAME TIME

I ENJOY BOTH ON THEIR ON MERITS AND COULDN'T REALLY ADVICE YOU ON THAT I GUESS I WOULD LIKE MANSIONS JUST A BIT MORE IF IT WOULD HAVE ONE OR TWO SHORTER SCENARIOS MIN BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD HIT THE TABLE MORE

FOR SOLO I GUESS I LIKE MARKHAM CG A BIT MORE BECAUSE OF THE SHORTER GAME TIME WITH A FEW FRIENDS I WOULD LIKE MANSIONS MORE BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH FUN TO EXPLORE A GRAVEYARD AND KILL ZOMBIES AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON
MARKHAM HAS JUST BEEN RELEASED AND IS A PAIN TO FIND MANSIONS OF MADNESS MIGHT BE SOLD OUT BETWEEN PRINTINGS

CHECK AVAILABILITY FIRST IT MAY BE A DECIDING FACTOR

MADNESS IS GREAT IF YOU HAVE A TV CONNECTED TO A PC WITH A WIRELESS MOUSE OVERLOOKING THE GAMING AREA

MARKHAM KINDA NEEDS TWO COPIES OF THE CORE SET OR AN EXPANSION FOR DECK CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS WITH A SINGLE CORE IT'S JUST ADD ALL THE CARDS OF YOUR CHARACTERS TWO COLOURS AND SOME NEUTRALS

CHARACTERS PLAYING TWO AT A TIME TWO FULL CAMPAIGNS BEFORE YOU'VE KINDA PLAYED ALL THE BASICS THAT'S ABOUT HOURS WORTH OF CONTENTION

MANSIONS OF MADNESS IT'S SCENARIOS WITHOUT ANY OF THE BONUS MATERIAL SHORTEST IS LONGEST IS LIKE HOURS I THINK MANSIONS HAS THE EDGE ON CONTENT VALUE
I'VE PLAYED BOTH QUITE A LOT AND ENJOY BOTH OF THEM IMMENSELY IT'S REALLY HARD TO RECOMMEND ONE OVER ANOTHER

DO YOU VALUE MINIATURES AND VISUAL IMMERSION OVER THE PERSISTENT CAMPAIGN IF YOU DO GO WITH MANSIONS OF MADNESS I PERSONALLY PREFER THE CAMPAIGN PLAY IN MARKHAM HORROR TCG AND THE PERMANENT EFFECTS YOU'LL GET DURING THE SCENARIOS IT REALLY FEELS MORE PERSONAL AND YOU'LL BECOME MORE ATTACHED TO YOUR INVESTIGATOR MOM HAS NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WHATSOEVER

THE REPLAY VALUE IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME IN BOTH GAMES MAYBE LEANING A BIT MORE TOWARDS THE AH TCH SINCE IT HAS CLEARER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS CLASSES AND PLAYING THE CAMPAIGN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER CHARACTER MAY FEEL VERY DIFFERENT MANSIONS OF MADNESS HAS A DECENT REPLAY VALUE TOO WITH DIFFERENT OUTCOMES AND SOME RANDOMIZATION ALTHOUGH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE OF IT IT IS HOWEVER HARDER TO CONTROL HOW MUCH OF THE NEW STUFF YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE ON THE FOLLOWING PLAYTHROUGHS

PLAYING TIME IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES AH GENERALLY PLAYS FASTER THAN MOM MOM HAS A FEW SHORTER SCENARIOS BUT IT ALSO HAS A COUPLE OF REALLY LONG ONES SO IF YOU PREFER SHORTER SESSIONS AH IS BETTER FOR YOU

LASTLY CAN YOU COMMIT TO PLAY THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN WITH YOU SO WITH MANSIONS OF MADNESS YOU CAN CHANGE THE PLAYER COUNT WITHOUT ISSUES EVERY TIME YOU PLAY THE GAME BUT IF YOU START AH WITH TWO YOU'LL BE MORE OR LESS STUCK WITH THAT AMOUNT OF PLAYERS THROUGH THE GAME YOU CAN PLAY SOLO AFTER YOU'VE STARTED WITH TWO BUT YOU BASICALLY CAN'T GO BACK TO TWO AFTER PLAYING ALONE

I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TWO CORE SETS FOR MARKHAM HORROR UNLESS YOU'RE A MINIMAXES YOU HAVE PLENTY OF OPTIONS WITH ONE CORE SET AND YOU'LL BE GETTING MORE WITH THE EXPANSIONS SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING TWO CORE SETS BEFORE YOU'VE PLAYED THROUGH THE FIRST CAMPAIGN AND DECIDED YOURSELF WHETHER YOU'LL NEED MORE OPTIONS OR NOT I PERSONALLY LIKE THE UNIQUENESS THE SINGLE CORE BOX CAUSES SINCE YOU CAN'T HAVE MULTIPLE COPIES OF EACH CARD IN YOUR DECK AND ESPECIALLY WITH BOTH INVESTIGATORS IN PLAY FOR ME IT'S MORE THEMATIC THAT WAY

ALSO YOU DON'T NEED A TV SETUP FOR MOM WE HAVE TO OPTION TO CONNECT ON TV BUT USUALLY WE USE A TABLET AND EITHER ROTATE IT FROM PLAYER TO ANOTHER OR ONLY ONE PERSON HANDLES THE APPARENTLY I FEEL IT'S REALLY WEIRD IF EVERYONE JUST KEEPS STARING AT THE SCREEN SILENTLY WHILE READING THE TEXTS INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE ACTUAL GAME AND SOMEONE READING THE TEXT ALOUD
EUREKA MINIATURES DOES A WIDE RANGE OF SCULPTS AT DECENT PRICES THEY HAVE A CULTISTS RANGE FROM MEMORY WHICH MIGHT HELP WITH YOUR CTHULHU GAME
HAS A PRETTY LARGE RANGE OF FOR DECENT PRICES THOUGH IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE YOU ARE LOOKING SPECIFICALLY FOR CTHULHU BASED SCULPTS

THERE IS A KICKSTARTER RUNNING AT THE MOMENT HERE THAT HAS SOME UNIQUE SCULPTS IF THAT IS THE KIND OF THING YOU WERE LOOKING FOR

HOPE THIS HELPS
IS IT MUNCHKIN DESCRIPTION SOUNDS ODDLY SIMILAR TO IT THERE'S PROBABLY A NUMBER OF OTHER GAMES THAT FIT THE DESCRIPTION BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME TO MIND
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM HERE

WITH AMA GETS YOU OFF ONE ORDER SAVE UP TO ON THE TOTAL ORDER PANDEMIC LEGACY FOR BLOOD RAGE AFTER YOU GET FREE SHIPPING THAT'S BEFORE THE DISCOUNT SO PANDEMIC LEGACY IS UNDER SHIPPED IF YOU ARE IN A PLACE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY TAXES THIS ISN'T A FIRST THREE ORDERS DEAL EITHER ANYONE CAN USE IT

SO FAR THE BEST DEAL I HAVE SEEN ON BOARD GAMES
B N HAS BY ONE GET ONE OFF BOARD GAMES

ADDITIONALLY THERE IS A BLACK FRIDAY OFF ONE ITEM COUPON OUT THERE

I DID THAT TODAY AND GOT ABOVE AND BELOW AND THE BIG BOOK OF MADNESS FOR A TOTAL OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE
AN EXAMINATION OF CAMELCAMELCAMEL SHOWS THAT BLACK FRIDAY SHOPPING FOR BOARD GAMES USUALLY WON'T SAVE YOU THAT MUCH MONEY CHEAPEST PRICES HAPPEN IN THE SUMMER GENERALLY LOTS OF GAMES ARE ACTUALLY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE TODAY THAN THEY WERE EARLIER THIS YEAR
AMAZON HAS A BUNCH OF THE QUEEN GAMES DEEPLY DISCOUNTED KINGDOM BUILDER IS A STEAL RIGHT NOW
PICKED UP CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD FOR WITH FREE SHIPPING

EDITED ADDED LINK

R BOARDGAMEDEALS
WHERE'S MINE
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO BOTH OF THEM BUT I ORDERED THROUGH A RETAILER AND THEY ARE GETTING THEIRS SHIPPED NOW AFTER ALL THE ORDERS DIRECT FROM PLOTTER SO I'VE GOT A WHILE TO WAIT
I'M WAITING FOR FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE TO BE

THEIR WEBSITE STATES THERE'S NO PLANS ON A BUT IT'S DOWN TO DEMAND

IS THE GREAT ZIMBABWE SIMILAR TO FM
THEY'VE BEEN IN MY FAGS EVER SINCE THE OWNER BROUGHT THEM BACK FROM ESSEN AS WELL AS COPIES OF ROADS BOATS AND DUCK DEALER I THINK FM HAS GONE NOW BUT HE STILL HAS TEZ AND INDONESIA

I GUESS THERE ISN'T A HUGE DEMAND FOR PLOTTER GAMES AROUND HERE
BOARDGAME SHAFAUSA

WHAT DO I WIN A COPY OF THE GAME
EH YOU'RE NOT MISSING MUCH THE COMPONENTS DON'T HELP IMPOSSIBLY SMALL COINS DARK AND GLOSSY BOARD AND THE GAME WAS MERELY OKAY AT BEST I WANTED TO LOVE IT BUT GAVE IT AWAY
THE FIRST GAME HAS MORE CONTENTION BUT THE CONTENT IS ROUGH I'VE PLAYED ALL OF EACH AND I RECOMMEND 2ND EDITION OVER VS FIRST
PLAYED BOTH OWN IT'S MY FAVORITE GAME OF THE YEAR AND THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD YEAR FOR GAMES

IS GREAT BUT IT'S SUPER FIDDLY TO SET EVERYTHING UP AND THE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE RELIES HEAVILY ON THE DM MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE INTERESTING TO THE ENTIRE GROUP THAT MEANS THAT HAVING A PLAYER AS THE DM CAN SOMETIMES MAKE FOR A PRETTY MISERABLE EXPERIENCE ALL AROUND IF THEIR ONLY GOAL IS WINNING

WITH THE APP DOES A BRILLIANT JOB AT HANDLING THIS ON THE FIRST PLAY OF EACH SCENARIO YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOUR GOAL IS AND THE EXPLORATION ASPECT OF THE GAME FEELS THRILLING AS THE STORY SLOWLY COMES TOGETHER ON LATER PLAYS THE MAP LAYOUT CREATURES ITEMS ARE SHAKEN UP A BIT TO CREATE MORE OF A PUZZLE I'VE REPLAYED A FEW OF THE SCENARIOS SEVERAL TIMES AND I'M STILL ENAMORED I DO RECOMMEND THE TILEPACKS THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS BUT THE THE APP WILL SOMETIMES USE THOSE NEW COMPONENTS IN THE OLD SCENARIOS AS WELL HOWEVER I DON'T FIND THEM NECESSARY YOU CAN GET A LOT OF MILEAGE OUT OF JUST THE BASE GAME SCENARIOS
I DIDNT LIKE AT ALL THE STORIES WERE INTERESTING BUT THE MECHANICS WHERE SOMEONE BASICALLY STARES AT A PUZZLE ON THEIR PHONE FOR A COUPLE ACTIONS IS GOD AWFUL
I'M CURIOUS TOO CAUSE EVERYONE IS SO HYPED THAT FFA DROPPED THE DUNGEON MASTER THAT THE APP DOES SO MANY THINGS ETC ETC BUT IS THE GAME ACTUALLY BETTER THAN PLAYING WITH AN DM PLAYER I HAVE IMPERIAL ASSAULT WHICH WILL GET A SIMILAR APP SOON I'VE SEEN THE DESCENT ONE AND I CAN'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE PLAYING LIKE THIS BEEFING BETTER THAN VS A LIVE PLAYER
SIMPLE QUESTION DO YOU WANT TO PLAY VERSUS ALL OR A CO-OP GAME USING AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE

I HAVE THE FIRST EDITION WITH ONE EXPANSION AND I ADORE IT BUT I LIKE THE VERSUS ALL CONCEPT

THE FIRST EDITION ISN'T VERY MUCH AVAILABLE THOUGH AND WON'T RECEIVE ANY MORE EXPANSIONS
I'VE FOUND A FIRST EDITION VERSION ONLINE ALREADY WHICH IS WHY I'M SO CONFLICTED BECAUSE THE SECOND EDITION IS PRICY BUT IS IT WORTH IT I HEARD GAME PLAY CAN GET STALE WITH THE 2ND SINCE THE APP DOESN'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO OFFER SO I WOULD NEED TO GET MORE EXPANSIONS ASAP AS WELL IS FROM WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING I'M JUST SO CONFLICTED BECAUSE I'VE NEVER PLAYED EITHER OF THEM
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH THIS HAS HELPED A LOT
DIDN'T PLAY THE 1ST BUT I REALLY REALLY LIKE THE 2ND THE WAY THE APP INTEGRATES IS BEAUTIFUL AND THE STORY IS STILL COMPELLING


2ND EDITION HAS BEEN BETTER RECEIVED THAN 1ST PERSONAL PREFERENCE ASIDE IT IS THE BETTER BET

IF YOU REALLY CANNOT DECIDE AND HAVE CASH TO BURN THERE IS A SYNERGIA TO BUYING BOTH YOU CAN USE THE CONVERSION KIT THAT COMES WITH 2ND EDITION TO TURN THE 1ST EDITION COMPONENTS INTO A 2ND EDITION EXPANSION IT'S ONLY AN EFFECTIVE OPTION IF YOU WANT TO OWN BOTH EDITIONS OTHERWISE YOU CAN BUY NICER VERSIONS OF THE EXPANSION COMPONENTS IN AN EXPANSION BOX
GET THE THIRD EDITION
MY DAD HAS WORKED ON CAR UPHOLSTERY ALL HIS LIFE I'LL CHECK WITH HIM IN THE MORNING AND POST A FOLLOWUP
IF YOU LOOK AT THE MANUFACTURERS SITE SOMETIMES THEY DESCRIBE FOAMS IN DETAIL SOMETIMES THEY HAVE A WATER RESISTANT SIDE OR A SIDE MEANT TO BE GLUED DOWN PROBLEM IS EITHER OF THOSE COULD BE THE SMOOTHER SIDE
IF YOU'RE ALREADY A R BOARDGAMES SUBSCRIBER I'D SUGGEST GETTING INTO THE LORE OF THE WARHAMMER FIRST VIA ONE OF THE WARHAMMER BOARD GAMES

SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL IS A NICE RELATIVELY SIMPLE ONE THAT CAN BE PLAYED SOLO OR CO-OP AND INTRODUCES INTEGRAL WARHAMMER CONCEPTS SUCH AS THE VOID SPACE HULKS TYRANNIDES GENESTEALERS AND OF COURSE SEVERAL CHAPTERS OF SPACE MARINES

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WARHAMMER FANTASY STUFF TALISMAN COVERS LOTS OF THINGS ABOUT THE EXISTING RACES AND SUCH IT'S A RATHER SIMPLE BUT SURPRISINGLY PRETTY FUN ROLL AND MOVE GAME

AFTER THAT GET YOURSELF TO THE WARHAMMER SUBREDDIT AND HAVE THEM EXPLAIN IT
THE PROBLEM WITH WARHAMMER FANTASY ISN'T THAT IT'S EXPENSIVE IT'S SLIGHTLY OVERPRICED BECAUSE OF THE BRAND NAME BUT YOU GET HIGH QUALITY MODELS GENERALLY YOU HAVE LARGE SCALE BATTLES IF YOU WANT SMALL SCALE THERE'S TONS OF BETTER ALTERNATIVES AND THAT OF COURSE COSTS MONEY THEN YOU NEED A LARGE SPACE SEVERAL BOOKS TERRAIN AND VARIOUS MISCELLANEOUS STUFF THIS IS BECAUSE THE GAME HAS AMASSED A TON OF CONTENT AND BECAUSE OF ITS SCOPE THE COST OF THE GAME IS FINE AND EXPECTED

HOWEVER REGARDLESS OF WHICH EDITION YOU CHOOSE THE CURRENT ONE IS DETESTED BY FANS BECAUSE IT'S NOT FOCUSED AROUND ARMY LISTS YOU WILL FACE THE ACTUAL PROBLEM THE GAME PLAY AND STRATEGY IS SUPERFICIAL AND UNNECESSARILY TIME CONSUMING MAKING YOUR ARMY LIST PERFECT IS HUGELY IMPORTANT MAKING A UNIT AN EVEN NUMBER OF MODELS FOR AESTHETICS CAN BE EXTREMELY PUNISHING

YOUR ARMY LIST AND DEPLOYMENT IS EASILY THE TWO BIGGEST DECISIONS YOU WILL MAKE AND DECIDE AT LEAST OF THE OUTCOME OF THE BATTLE THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU START ACTUALLY PLAYING THE BATTLE AN EXPERIENCED PLAYER CAN LOOK AT YOUR SETUP AND FAIRLY ACCURATELY PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE BATTLE REGARDLESS OF HOW EITHER OF YOU PLAY AND WHAT YOU ROLL ON THE DICE

THE LIST BUILDING AND SETUP ROUTINELY TAKES HOURS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCED WITH THE GAME PLAYING THE ACTUAL BATTLE TAKES HOURS ON TOP OF THAT MOST OF YOUR DECISIONS ARE MADE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE BATTLE AFTER YOU GET INTO CLOSE COMBAT WHICH IS THE MEAT OF THE GAME THE GAME GIVES YOU ALMOST NO CHOICES TO MAKE IN CLOSE COMBAT YOU CAN DECIDE TO TARGET SPECIAL CHARACTERS OR WHOLE UNITS THAT'S USUALLY IT SOMETIMES THERE'S A SPECIAL RULE TO ACTIVATE BUT MOST OF THEM ARE COMPLETELY AUTOMATIC

LOOK AT BATTLE REPORTS THOSE I KNOW THAT STILL LIKE WARHAMMER LIKE BRS SO I THINK IT'S A GOOD INDICATION IF YOU WILL LIKE THE GAME IF WE IGNORE THE ASPECTS OF COLLECTING PAINTING ETC WHEN YOU WATCH THE BRS TRY TO PAY ATTENTION TO EVERY CHOICE GIVEN TO THE PLAYERS AND IF THOSE CHOICES ARE ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL AFTER SETUP I CAN GENERALIZE FROM EXPERIENCE THAT EACH PLAYER MAKES ABOUT A DOZEN MEANINGFUL DECISIONS IN A GAME THAT TAKES HOURS THAT'S MY PROBLEM WITH WARHAMMER
YOU HAVE A CHOICE WARGAME FANTASY OR THE SCI-FI VERSION COMMONLY KNOWN AS

REGARDLESS JUST BUY ONE OF THE BATTLEBOXES THAT COMES WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO GET STARTED EXCEPT THE PAINTS AND GLUE

THAT I BELIEVE IS WHAT YOU WERE ASKING AND YOU ARE AT THE WRONG PLACE

IF YOU WANTED THE BOARDGAME AND NOT THE MINIATURES WARGAME THEN READ THEIR REPLIES
GO TO A GAMES WORKSHOP STORE IF YOU HAVE ONE NEARBY AND CHAT WITH THE WORKERS THERE

IF NOT A GW SHOP GO TO YOUR AGS THAT WAY YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT THE SCENE IS LIKE

YOU DON'T WANT MINIS AND BOOKS SITTING AROUND UNPLAYED

UNLESS SOMEONE ON REDDIN LIVES IN YOUR AREA I DON'T THINK THERE'S BETTER ADVICE
SECONDING DEATH ANGEL IT'S PRETTY AFFORDABLE FOR NOW AND A LOT OF FUN WHETHER YOU'RE PLAYING SOLO OR CO-OP

ALSO SECONDING GETTING INTO THE LORE THERE ARE PLENTY OF WEBSITES OUT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND IT ON LEXICANUM AND OR DAKKADAKKA ARE GOOD ONES TO START WITH NOT TO MENTION THE WEALTH OF VIDEO GAMES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT GIVE YOU A FEEL FOR THE UNIVERSE DAWN OF WAR SPACE MARINE ETC
ALSO TRY R WARHAMMER
MTG ARENA OF THE PLANES WALKERS AND THE GAME IT'S BASED ON YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN TERRAIN AND EVERYTHING
DUST TACTICS AND IMPERIAL ASSAULT
YOU MIGHT TRY THE QUICK PLAY BATTLETECH VARIANTS ALPHA STRIKE WITH THE HEX RULES OR THE OLDER BATTLEFORCE RULES

WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO PLAY A FOOT MAP THOUGH
OLD SCHOOL BATTLEBALL HAD A LONG PLAYER BOARD PRETTY GREAT THRIFT STORE FIND IF YOU HAPPEN TO STUMBLE UPON IT I THINK DUST TACTICS HAD A PRETTY BIG BOARD SET UP AS WELL SEEMS PRETTY BIG FOR A BOARD GAME THOUGH THIS IS MOSTLY TABLETOP SKIRMISH DIMENSIONS OR JUST PICK UP A BATTELMATT AND FROSTGRAVE AS WELL AS SOME MINIS NOW THATS A GREAT GAME
PROJECT ELITE I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S QUITE BUT IT DOES STRIKE ME AS A VERY LARGE BOARD
RIVET WARS FROM COOL MINI OR NOT ALTERNATE TIME LINE WWI MINIATURES GAME VERY VIDEO GAME LIKE ONE OF MY FAVORITES
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRACK DOWN A COPY OF MILTON BATTLE MASTERS A DECENT GAME FOR IT'S TIME WITH A HEX BASED VINYL MAP ABOUT FT
YOU'RE IN LUCK YOU CAN GO BACK THE KINGDOM DEATH KICKSTARTER RIGHT NOW THE BOARD IS PRETTY BIG BUT NOT QUITE FOUR FEET BIG IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THAT BIG THOUGH BECAUSE A FIGHT IS USUALLY FOUR SURVIVORS VERSUS SOME SORT OF MONSTER NOT TWO ARMIES
HEROSCAPE IS A ROUGH TO FIND ONE THAT'D BE RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY PROBABLY MASSIVE 3D BOARD FOR THAT ONE ARENA OF THE PLANESWALKERS IS A CLOSE SECOND

HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT BATTLE LORE THOUGH LARGE BOARD HEXES AND ITS AN EXCELLENT GAME MEMOIR IS THE SAME SYSTEM AS WELL BUT WW2 THEMED
HAVEN'T PLAYED THEM BOTH BUT ADAMIK QUADROPOLIS AND BLUEPRINTS HAVE THAT ARCHITECTURAL THEME CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG MAY ALSO BE OF INTEREST BUT I'M NOT SURE ANOTHER ONE WHICH I PLAYED IS ALHAMBRA A TILE LAYING GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO BUILD A STRUCTURE WITHIN CERTAIN GUIDELINES ALL OF THEM ARE WORTH CHECKING OUT AT THE VERY LEAST
THE GAME YOU WANT IS CLINIC

CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG IS FINE BUT THE GAME YOU REALLY WANT IS CLINIC
CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG

LITERALLY ABOUT DESIGNING HOUSES CASTLES ROOM BY ROOM THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOUR DAD

MOST OF THE OTHER GAMES SUGGESTED HERE ARE ABOUT TOWN PLANNING NOT ARCHITECTURE
NEW YORK

ABOUT GREAT ARCHITECTURE AROUND THE TURN IF LAST CENTURY
SUBURBIA IS A GREAT CITY BUILDING GAME AS A CIVIL ENGINEER I REALLY ENJOY IT

DREAM HOME IS A NEW ONE I HAVEN'T PLAYED BUT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST
SMALL CITY
I'M AN ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNER NOT AN ARCHITECT YET BUT MAYBE HE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SOME OF MY FAVORITE GAMES

MEDINA IS A BEAUTIFUL GAME THAT ENDS UP LOOKING LIKE A 3D CITY JUST THE WAY IT LOOKS MAKES MY COWORKERS PLAY THE GAME IT'S PRETTY FUN GAME TOO

SANTORINITE S NEW EDITION SHOULD BE COMING OUT SOON I PLAYED IT WHEN IT WAS STILL PNP BUT EVERYTHING LOOKS BETTER NOW BEAUTIFUL GAME

HE MIGHT ALSO ENJOY GAMES WITH SPATIAL ASPECTS LIKE PATCHWORK PUEBLO AND TOWN CENTER
I WAS AN ARCH STUDENT AND I LOVE QUADROPOLIS SUBURBIA AND IMHOTEP WATCHING THE THINGS GROWING IS REALLY SATISFYING ALSO I DON'T ACTUALLY CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT WINNING IN THESE GAMES I LIKE A PRETTY CITY BUILT AND THAT'S GOOD

NOW IF YOU NEED SOMETHING HEAVIER I'M LOOKING AT TRAMWAYS FOR A PRETTY LONG TIME TOO
THERE'S ALSO BRUXELLES AND BURAN THAT KINDA HAS THE ARCHITECT FEEL
HOW ABOUT SARADA
SO MAYBE NOT QUITE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING OF BUT I'D GO FOR GO CUCKOO I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S A CIVIL ENGINEER AND HE ABSOLUTELY KILLS AT THESE KINDS OF GAMES BECAUSE HE'S GOT A LEG UP ON UNDERSTANDING STRUCTURAL WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION

THERE'S ALSO A VERY GAME CALLED JUTAKU THAT RAN ON KICKSTARTER A FEW MONTHS AGO AND IS JUST GETTING FULFILLED THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF COPIES AVAILABLE TO BUY DIRECT FROM THE DESIGNER BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING TO GO INTO ANY MORE PRODUCTION
CHECK OUT STAR WARS IMPERIAL ASSAULT IF YOU'RE IN ANY WAY A STAR WARS FAN
I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE NEW CONAN GAME IT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AFTER PLAYING GAMES LIKE DESCENT I REALLY TRIED TO LIKE DESCENT I PLAYED IT FOR ABOUT HOURS I COULD NEVER GET INTO IT AND MY FRIENDS COULDN'T REALLY EITHER IT JUST FEELS RESTRICTIVE AND ARTIFICIAL WITH NO STRONG THEME TO HOLD IT TOGETHER IT ALWAYS FELT LIKE THE HEROES WERE GETTING IN EACH WAY

CONAN BY CONTRAST IS A NEW FAVORITE OF MY GROUP WE'VE PLAYED ABOUT TIMES IN THE MONTH SINCE I GOT IT IT FEELS OPEN AND FREE PLAYERS CAN TAKE AS MANY ACTIONS AS THEY WANT ASSUMING THEY HAVE THE ENERGY AND IN ANY ORDER AND THERE'S NO GRID SO YOU AREN'T TRYING TO GET AROUND EACH OTHER IT'S JUST FUN AND YOU AREN'T CHECKING THE RULES ALL THE TIME LIKE WE DID WITH DESCENT

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CONAN OVER DESCENT OR IT'S CLONES LIKE IMPERIAL ASSAULT ESPECIALLY OVER THE LONG TERM SINCE ALL OF US ARE ALREADY EXCITED TO CREATE OUR OWN SCENARIOS AND CAMPAIGNS LIKE WE DID IN THE S WITH HEROQUEST
MAYBE GLOOMHAVEN OR MY FAVORITE DUNGEON CRAWLER AT THE MOMENT OMEGA PROTOCOL
GALAXY DEFENDERS IS A GREAT GAME GRANTED IT'S SCI FI THEMED

THE SAME COMPANY IS RELEASING A FANTASY ONE SOON CALLED SWORD AND SORCERY

CHECK OUT GLOOMHAVEN AS WELL
ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE

ARCADIA QUEST
I'M A HUGE FAN OF MYTH BUT IT'S A PRETTY NICHE FOLLOWING

YOU CAN CURRENTLY GET THE BASE GAME AND TWO EXPANSIONS FOR ON THEIR BLACK FRIDAY DEAL THE EXPANSIONS JUST SHIPPED LAST WEEK SO THEY ARE BRAND NEW CONTENTION

THE ONLY REAL DOWNFALL IS NOT GETTING THE EXTRA KICKSTARTER STUFF THAT CAME WITH THESE PLEDGES ORIGINALLY

IT PROBABLY PLAYS BEST WITH BUT WE PLAY WITH THERE ARE FIVE CLASSES IN THE BASE GAME AND ONE EACH ADDITIONAL IN THE EXPANSIONS

I JUST FINISHED PAINTING HETP SOME OF THE MINIS FROM THE EXPANSION
THE OTHERS SINS
UH KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER
GENION BECAUSE YOU CAN CRAFT THE EXPERIENCE TO FIT MOST ANY OF THE OTHER CONSONANT YOU WANT TO JUST PLAY BOARD GAMES DONE YOU WANT A MASSIVE SALES FLOOR DONE DO WHAT YOU WANT THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES AND GAMES AND MORE GAMES DON'T REALLY CARE MUCH ABOUT VENDORS

BG IS BETTER THEN GENION IN THAT REGUARD

WANT TO SEE A CHOEL BUNCH OF SUPER VENDORS AND GET A BUNCH OF COOL EARLY RELEASES AND PROMOS DON'T MIND SPENDING A LOT OF CASH TO PLAY GAMES AND GO TO EVENTS THEN GEN CON CAN'T BE BEAT

BG AT SEA IS A VACATION FIRST DO YOU LIKE WHERE THEY ARE CRUISING TOO IT'S BASICALLY A CRUISE WHERE INSTEAD OF SITTING AROUND A POOL YOU CAN SIT AROUND PLAYING GAMES EVERY EVENING AND AT SEA DAY
I THINK IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE AND DO IF YOU WANT TO CATCH THE LATEST GAME RELEASES SOUNDS LIKE GENION LIVE IN NORTH AMERICA OR ESSEN LIVE IN EUROPE IF IT'S TO PLAY GAMES AND MEET PEOPLE OR DICETOWER CON FOR ME I WOULD PICK DICETOWER CON IT SOUNDS LIKE A NICE SIZED CONVENTION WITH LOTS OF GAMING AND THE DICETOWER CREW SEEM LIKE A FUN BUNCH NEVER BEEN TO ANY OF THESE BUT HOPE TO ONE DAY
GENION NOT THAT I'LL EVER GO TO ANY OF THEM AS CIVE IN THE UK
COMPILING WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID AND PHRASING IT THIS WAY IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT YOU WANT THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS GENION BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS THERE PARAPHRASING GARY OLDMAN EVERYTHING
BG CON IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DAYS OF NONSTOP BOARDGAMING AND A DECENT SELECTION OF VENDORS AND NEW RELEASES
GENION ALL DAY EVERYDAY
NOT THAT I'VE BEEN TO THE OTHER TWO BUT GENION IS GREAT I'M NOT A HUGE GAMER BUT WENT THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH THE BOYFRIEND AND OF OUR GAMING GROUP NEARLY EVERY NIGHT WE'D STAY UP LATE TO PLAY GAMES AND DRINK IN THE HOTEL LOBBIES BASICALLY THE WHOLE DOWNTOWN IS VERY WELCOMING TO THE ATTENDEES
GREENWAY IN ST LOUIS WOULD BE MY ONE AND ONLY IF I HAD TO CHOOSE

BETWEEN YOUR TWO BG ALL DAY GENION IS NOT AS AWESOME AS IT USED TO BE
IF I HAD TO CHOOSE PERSONALLY I WOULD GO EITHER GENION OR SPIEL ESSEN AND DICE TOWER CON OFC
MAYBE GLOOMHAVEN IT'S A GAME BEING RELEASED IN JANUARY FOR KICKSTARTER BACKERS AND GENERAL PREORDER STILL OPEN IT'S A LEGACY STYLE GAME WITH A PERSISTENT WORLD FOR PLAYERS NOT FOR EVERYONE FOR SURE YOU'RE LOOKING AT STORY DRIVEN SCENARIOS LITTLE DUNGEONS FOR ABOUT MINUTES EACH IN ADDITION TO TRAVELING THROUGH THE OPEN WORLD AND OF COURSE THE CITY GLOOMHAVEN ITSELF CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION THROUGH ITEMS UNIQUE ABILITIES THINK CLEAVE FOR WARRIORS FLAME STRIKE FOR MAGES STEALTH FOR ROGUES ETC AND CLASS PERKS
THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH OUT THERE LIKE IT ONE RECENT KICKSTARTER SEEMS TO HAVE SIMILAR MECHANICS MINUS THE ABSURD AMOUNTS OF DICE THOUGH IT IS COMPLETE WISH THERE WERE MORE LIKE IT I AM MIXED ON THE EXPANSIONS THEY MAKE THE GAME MUCH LONGER WHICH CAN BE AN ISSUE

PROJECTS SEANAABERG
DESCENT SECOND EDITION WHIT THE APP IS BY FAR YOUR BEST CHOICE
POCKET HIVE

OKAY I'M ACTUALLY OUT OF IDEAS NOW
LOST CITIES AND BATTLE LINE ARE GREAT 2 PLAYER CARD GAMES THAT DON'T TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE
BATTLETOWN BATTLETOWN BATTLETOWN IT IS A BOARD GAME THAT REPLICATES 2D FIGHTING GAMES

NOT ONLY IS IT THE BEST 2 PLAYER GAME I HAVE BY A LANDSLIDE BUT IT ALSO SCALES UP TO PLAYERS THERE ARE STANDALONE SETS ONE COME WITH CARDS THAT YOU CAN USE AS THE BOARD SO YOU CAN FIT MOST OF THE GE IN A COUPLE DECKBOXES IF YOU NETBALL SETS THEN IT BECOMES ONE OF THE BEST AT HOME GAMES AS WELL TONS OF CONTENT LOTS OF VARIANTS THAT EVEN INCLUDES A PLAYER PUZZLE DUNGEON CRAWLER MODE
WELL THERE ARE ALWAYS BOARDGAME APPS CARCASSONNE PATCHWORK AND STAR REALMS ARE APPS I HAVE USED AND ENJOYED FOR 2 PLAYER GAMES

PATCHWORK AND STAR REALMS PHYSICAL COPIES DON'T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE HANAFI VALLEY OF THE KINGS AND POCKET HIVE ARE ALL PRETTY SMALL AND FUN WITH TWO PLAYERS
AS A MOUNTAINEER I'VE BEEN MAKING A LIST OF THE SMALLEST GAMES IN TERMS OF WEIGHT WHICH ISN'T THE SAME THING AS VOLUME BUT YOU SHOULD FIND A LOT OF CROSSOVER

THESE ARE SPECIFIC

SELLSWORDS
STAR REALMS
A COUPLE DECKS OF BATTLEGROUND FANTASY WARFARE
DECKBUILDING THE DECKBUILDING GAME
NIA
EPIC CARD GAME

THESE ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO TWO PLAYERS BUT AREN'T TERRIBLE FOR IT EITHER

LOVE LETTER
SUSHI GO
INNOVATION

TINY EPIC KINGDOMS AND TINY EPIC GALAXIES HAVE THE DISTINCTION OF BEING ISH GAMES WITH QUITE A BIT OF DEPTH FOR HOW SMALL THEY ARE

LOTS OF THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS HERE ARE GREAT TOO
GUILLOTINE AND FLUX ARE PRETTY MINIMAL ON SPACE REQUIREMENTS

EDIT ALSO GLOOM BUT IT DOES HAVE QUITE A FEW CARDS
WONDERS DUEL SANS BOX IS ONE OF THE LEADING CANDIDATES SINCE WE PLAY IT A LOT AND ENJOY IT ANYONE PLAYED THE EXPANSION

ANY OTHER GAMES THAT MIGHT BE UNPACKED TO TRAVEL BETTER
BOTH SAN JUAN AND RACE FOR THE GALAXY ARE ENGINE BUILDING EURO GAMES MADE UP OF BASICALLY JUST CARDS THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR GAMES WITH RACE BEING THE MORE COMPLICATED OF THE 2 I WOULD RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT BOTH MOTTAINAI AND INNOVATION ARE BOTH CARD GAMES BY CARL CHUDYK WHICH ARE VERY UNIQUE AND COMPLEX FOR THEIR SMALL SIZE HIS GAMES TAKE A FEW PLAYS TO REALLY GRASP WELL BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY LOVE THEM
SPENDER
TIDES OF TIME AND TIDES OF MADNESS CARDS AND A FEW TOKENS SMALL BOX AND SMALL FOOTPRINT DRAFTING

CONDOTTIERE DECK OF CARDS SMALL BOARD AND SMALL BOX

ARBORETUM SMALL BOX CARD GAME LARGER FOOTPRINT THAN THE GAMES MENTIONED ABOVE STYLE

TINY EPIC SMALL BOXES NOT SO SMALL FOOTPRINTS

JAIPUR MY DUDE ENDLESS FUN IN A SMALL LITTLE BOX
QUARTO TRAVEL EDITION
PLAYING BOARDGAMES LIVE ALMOST NEVER WORKS OUT WELL THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST RECORDED A GAMEPLAY OF IT SO THEY COULD HAVE PUT OUT A WELL POLISHED VERSION
I NOW THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION AND MIGHT NOT BE WELL RECEIVED IN THIS THREAD BUT NOW I'M GLAD I DIDN'T BACK THIS IT JUST DOESN'T PULL ME IN AT ALL AND IT FEELS FIDDLY
WELL BETWEEN THIS AND ADM I CAN SEE OBVIOUS WINNER
I JUST READ SOME POSTS IN THE KINGDOM DEATH THREAD AND ACTUALLY THAT SOUNDED VERY MUCH LIKE WHAT DARK SOULS SHOULD BE IF IT WERE MADE INTO A BOARD GAME
THINKING ABOUT GETTING A REFUND ON MY PLEDGE BUT THOSE MINIS AND BONUSES LOOK SO DARK SOULS ALSO COULD I USE THOSE MINIS FOR KD M
THE ONLY WAY I SEE TO GET THE PHYSICAL GAME IS TO SPLIT THE COST WITH FRIENDS THIS ALSO ENSURES YOU'LL HAVE PEOPLE WHO STICK THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN

IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT OUT FIRST YOU SHOULD GET TABLETOP SIMULATOR ON YOUR COMPUTER IT'S ON SALE THIS WEEKEND KINGDOM DEATH IS ON THERE AND YOU CAN TRY OUT A FEW ATTACKS OR PLAN STRATEGY
YEAH FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN I'D ENJOY IT

BUT FOR THE MONEY I CAN GET MULTIPLE GAMES I'D ALSO ENJOY

THE MINIS ARE LOVELY BUT I REALLY WISH THEY DID A VERSION WITHOUT THEM FOR A MORE SENSIBLE PRICE
OPEN SPOTS NOW IN THE BLACK FRIDAY GOLD LANTERN LEVEL THEY UPPED IT TO BACKERS IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED
SO I'M RELATIVELY NEW TO THE HOBBY UNDER A YEAR AND LOVING HAVING CHOICE AND DIFFERENT GAME TYPES FOR MY BROTHER AND I TO PLAY MY WIFE DIPS HER TOE IN EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE TOO I'M A GAMER AT HEART AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HEAVY ON VIDEO GAMES ESPECIALLY IMMERSIVE RAGS

NOW I KNOW BOARD GAMING IS DIFFERENT THAN VIDEO GAMING BUT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SCRATCH THAT SAME ITCH ON THE TABLETOP DESCENT MOM 2ND ARABIAN NIGHTS ELDRITCH HORROR TIME STORIES AND EVEN THE NEW MARKHAM CG ALL SATISFY SOME PART OF WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR HERE

I RECENTLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HANG OUT WITH AN OLD CHILDHOOD FRIEND WAY MORE INTO BOARDGAMES THAN ME AND WHO HAD A COPY OF ADM WOW WHAT A GAME WE PLAYED FOR HOURS AND I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT SINCE

THE IDEA OF BUILDING A SETTLEMENT OVER JUST MANAGING A DUDE OR TWO REALLY HIT ME IT HAS THE LONG GAME IN MIND AND MY MIND PUTS IN A CHECK MARK

CUSTOMIZATION CHOICE IN GROWTH CHECK CHECK

HARD CHOICES WITH RAMIFICATIONS THAT EFFECT YOU LATER CHECK

PLAYS GREAT AT OR 2 PEOPLE GREAT TO LOOK AT DIFFICULT ALL THESE THINGS YES

I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR HESITANCY SPENDING CONSOLE MONEY ON ONE BOX OF PLASTIC AND CARDS FOR ME HOWEVER THERE WAS NO WAY I WOULD MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN THIS GEM OF A GAME I THINK THIS WILL IN A SENSE RETIRE A LOT OF OTHER GAMES I HAVE SUMMER OF NEXT YEAR CAN'T GET HERE FAST ENOUGH I FEEL LIKE I'M A KID AGAIN WAITING ON CHRISTMAS NOT TOO MUCH IN THIS WORLD DOES THAT TO A YEAR OLD

HAPPY GAMING
I'M DEFINITELY WITH YOU I'M WATCHING THE PAGE AS WELL SUFFERING FROM A STRONG CASE OF COMO

I LOVE THE ART STYLE THE GAMEPLAY SOUNDS AWESOME AND THE MINIS LOOK AMAZING THE ONLY THINGS MAKING ME STALL IS THAT MY WIFE PROBABLY WON'T APPRECIATE THE ART STYLE AND I DON'T HAVE A GROUP THAT WILL APPRECIATE THE INTRICACY OF THE GAME
YOU CAN GET A LOT OF PLAYTIME OUT OF THE GAME BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO ENJOY PUTTING TOGETHER MINIATURES EVEN BETTER IF YOU LIKE PAINTING THEM TOO OTHERWISE YOU'RE BASICALLY PAYING FOR A LOT OF THINGS YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO USE CONSIDERING THERE'S A TON OF ARMOR SETS YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH TO CREATE YOUR MINIATURES IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF A KIND THOUGH VERY FUN BUT SOMETHING YOU'LL NEED TO SET UP A CONSISTENT MEET UP TO GET THROUGH UNLESS YOU'RE PLAYING SOLO
I AGREE IT'S MORE A GAME SYSTEM THAN JUST A STANDALONE GAME IT FEELS MORE LIKE YOU BROUGHT HOME A BIG CRATE OF NEW RPG BOOKS AND ALSO A TON OF MINIS THAN A BIG MINIS BOARD GAME LIKE MASSIVE DARKNESS JUST FROM THE CAMPAIGN FOCUS OPEN-ENDEDNESS AND FOCUS ON BOUTIQUE MINIS SO I LIKEN THE COST TO TO A COLLECTIBLE HOBBY AS OPPOSED TO A ONE-OFF GAME EX COST TO GET INTO A GAME DEPENDING ON CHROME COST TO GET INTO LET'S SAY STAR WARS ARMADA A PRETTY BINGY COLLECTIBLE GAME CORE SET PLUS WHATEVER SHIPS YOU WANT FOR YOUR PERFECT FLEET AND THAT'S UNTIL META SHIFTS AND YOU NEED TO UPDATE AGAIN ALSO MUCH LIKE THE COLLECTIBLE GAME AND MUCH LIKE MOST GW PRODUCTS ADM IS A LIFESTYLE GAME IT'S DESIGNED TO BE THE PRIMARY THING YOU SPEND MONEY ON PLAY AND NOT AN GAME SO ONE MAY BUY LESS OTHER GAMES WHILE DEEP INTO ADM BUT IF THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEN IT NIGHT JUST MAKE IT OUT OCCASIONALLY AND BE A HUGE BLACK PAPERWEIGHT ELSE WISE

ALL IN ALL I THINK THESE ARE CAVEATS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY INTO A LIFESTYLE GAME AND INVEST THE TIME AND MONEY TO GET THE BEST OUT OF IT AND JUST WANT SOMETHING CHEAPER MORE CASUAL JUST DIFFERENT LOOK ELSEWHERE BECAUSE YOUR MONEY WON'T BE WELL-SPENT HERE BUT IF IT GRABS YOU LIKE A COLLECTIBLE GAME GRABS A POOR INNOCENT SOUL WHO THINKS MAYBE I'LL PLAY WARHAMMER NOW YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED
YOU COULD GET SOME FRIENDS TO GO IN WITH YOU COMMIT TO PLAY AND SPLIT THE COST

IF I WERE INTERESTED IN GETTING A GAME FOR THE PRICES I'M SEEING THERE THAT'S DEFINITELY HOW I'D DO IT
THE KICKSTARTER DOESN'T END UNTIL JANUARY SO YOU HAVE A MONTH TO CHECK OUT GAME PLAY VIDEOS OR EVEN PLAY IT ON TABLETOP SIMULATOR TO DECIDE IF ITS FOR YOU
I MISSED THE ORIGINAL KICKSTARTER KICKED MYSELF FOR A LONG TIME AFTER IT FOR NOT PLEDGING THEN I MANAGED TO GET A COPY AFTER IT WAS SOLD OUT FOR A VERY REASONABLE PRICE

TRUTH IS THE GAME IS EXPENSIVE BUT ITS NOT A GAME IT'S A GAMING SYSTEM YOU WON'T HAVE BUYERS REMORSE WHEN YOU GET IT IN FACT IT WILL BECOME YOUR PRIDE AND JOY AMONG COIR COLLECTION
LASER ATTACK OR DRAGONMASTER

BOARDGAME 2 DRAGONMASTER

BOARDGAME
MY BET IS ALSO ON DRAGONMASTER WHILST I DON'T REMEMBER THE GAME I HAD IT WHEN I WAS AROUND I DO SEEM TO RECALL THE TACTILE FEEL OF THE CLICKY SEMI MODULAR GEMS

AWESOME DEAL
IF NOTHING ELSE GREAT MATH TRADE FODDER
EVERYONE SHOULD OWN A LEAST COPY OF CODENAMES IT NEVER FAILS
ANY DEALS FOR PICTURES
HOLY SHIT GREAT PRICE FOR A GREAT GAME
I RECENTLY DISCOVERED IMHOTEP AND IT IS SUCH A GREAT GEM EXCEDENT GAME TO INTRODUCE TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS OUTSIDE THE HOBBY AS WELL
I DID SOME PLAYTESTING FOR IT AND HAVE PLAYED THE FINAL VERSION IT'S OKAY BUT NOT ONE OF BEST DESIGNS I HAVE NO ATTACHMENT TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL THOUGH SO YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY
AS A BOARDGAME FAN IT'S A SOLID DESIGN COLLABORATIVE GAME BUILT AROUND THE CHALICE DUNGEONS HITS SOME NOTES THAT MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A MORE CONFRONTATIONAL BROOM SERVICE

AS A BLOODBORNE FAN IT'S NOT AS THEMATICALLY DEEP AS I WOULD LIKE IF MORE OF MY BOARD GAME FRIENDS WERE AVID BLOODBORNE PLAYERS IT WOULD BE QUITE SATISFYING SITTING AROUND TALKING WORKSHOP AND REMINISCING LAMENTING ABOUT THE TIMES WE ENCOUNTERED ALL THE BEASTS AND KIN IN THE BOX THE GAME PLAY ON ITS OWN DOESN'T SCREAM BLOODBORNE

THAT SAID I DID PICK UP A COPY AS A CONVERSATION PIECE WITH BLOODBORN FANS AND IN HOPES THAT IT MIGHT DRIVE COOL MINI OR NOT TO PRODUCE A BIG BOX BLOODBORNE GAME
IT REPLACED KING OF TOKYO FOR ME NO PLAYER ELIMINATION PUSH YOUR LUCK ENJOY IT WELL ENOUGH TO KEEP IT IN THE COLLECTION

DON'T EXPECT THE VIDEOGAME THOUGH THEY ONLY SHARE THE THEME AND THE IDEA THAT ANY ENEMY CAN SPANK YOU MERCILESSLY
IT'S A SOLID ENOUGH DESIGN THERE ARE SOME NEAT LITTLE DECISIONS AND PLENTY OF SATISFYING PLAYER INTERACTION I'D PROBABLY TURN IT DOWN IF SOMEONE OFFERED TO PLAY IT AT A NEETUP AGAIN THOUGH THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY MORE INTERESTING USES OF TIME
ITS ALRIGHT SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF CUTTHROAT CAVERNS IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET ENOUGH ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT BEING A HUGE FAN OF THE VIDEO GAME BUT AFTER A FEW PLAYS YOU'LL REALIZE IT'S A LITTLE THIN ON CONTENTION PLAYED TWICE NOW AT AND PLAYER COUNTS THE LATTER DEFINITELY THE BETTER DOUBT IT WILL EVER HIT THE TABLE AGAIN
GOT THIS GAME RECENTLY AND REALLY LIKE IT IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE VIDEO GAME YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOVE THE ARTWORK AND THE WEAPONS AND ENEMIES YOU CAN PLAY UNDER AN HOUR AND THERE IS ENOUGH THERE TO KEEP ME COMING BACK I LIKE THAT ITS EASY TO TEACH AND LEARN WHICH MAKES IT A GOOD OPTION FOR NEW GAMERS IT IS MY NEW GO TO PALATE CLEANSER GAME NOT A FEATURE GAME

IN MY OPINION THE GAMES DEPTH DEPLETES A LITTLE IF YOU ONLY HAVE PEOPLE PLAYERS GET TROPHIES FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE ENEMY KILLS AND WITH ALMOST EVERY PLAYER GETS A HIT IN ON EVERY ENEMY WITH PLAYERS IS MUCH MORE INTERESTING AS THE 4TH PLAYER HAS TO CHOOSE TO DEAL INSTANT DAMAGE HEAL OR EXPECT THE TURN TO MAKE IT TO THEM
OVERALL THE TONE OF YOUR RESPONSES IS KIND OF LEANING NEGATIVE BUT I'LL SAY THAT I THINK IT'S SOLID FOR WHAT IT IS IT IS A BIT LIGHT BUT IT'S GREAT AT DOING SO THE DECISIONS ARE INTERESTING AND EASY TO GRASP SO YOU GET INTO IT REAL QUICK THERE'S LOTS OF PLAYER INTERACTION AND OUR GAMES FEATURED PLENTY OF NEGOTIATION AND TABLE TALK THE THEME ISNT SUPER STRONG THOUGH OTHER THAN THE MONSTERS BEING BRUTAL AT TIMES BUT IF A QUICK MINS HIGHLY INTERACTIVE GAME WHERE YOU CAN PUSH YOUR LUCK AND HURT YOUR OPPONENTS SOUNDS FUN THEN I'D RECOMMEND THE GAME IT'S NOT OUR MAIN FEATURE AT GAME NIGHTS BUT I THINK WE'LL BE PULLING THIS OUT FOR A WHILE FOR A WARM UP OR CLOSER
COMPARED TO CUTTHROAT CAVERNS BLOODBORNE IMHO ISN'T WORTH IT AT LEAST FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN CUTTHROAT CAVERNS HAS DIFFERENT MONSTERS ALTERING THE WAY YOU DO COMBAT IT HAS VARYING ATTACK DAMAGE MODIFIERS DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU DRAW AND HAS A SUBSTANTIAL ENCOUNTER VARIETY WITH USING MONSTERS PER GAME OUT OF THE POSSIBLE IT ALSO HAS THIS COMPETITIVE NATURE TOO SINCE LIKE BLOODBORNE YOU NEED GET A HIT ON THE MONSTER IN THIS CASE YOU NEED TO GET LAST HIT

SO IF YOU AREN'T TOO STINGY ON THE THEME I WOULD SUGGEST CUTTHROAT CAVERNS INSTEAD I MYSELF CONSIDERED GETTING BLOODBORNE BEFORE BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO CC AND BTW CC HAS SO MANY EXPANSIONS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR MORE WHICH ADDS AN INSANE LEVEL OF VARIETY AND CUSTOMIZABILITY FOR YOUR CHARACTER
SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS IS ALWAYS A BIG HIT WITH EVERYONE I PLAY IT WITH PLAYS BUT THERE IS AN EXPANSION THAT ALLOWS UP TO YOU CAN GET THE EXPANSION COMBO PACK THAT INCLUDES ALL THREE EXPANSIONS FOR LIKE
KING OF TOKYO WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD ONE FOR YOU EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND FUN TO PLAY PLUS BEING PRIMARILY LUCK BASED IT HELPS THE YOUNG ONES HAVE A CHANCE
RHINO HERO IS PRETTY GREAT FOR ALL AGES GROUP OF OLDER PEOPLE MAKE IT A DRINKING GAME YOUNGER KIDS YOUNGER THAN YOURS TURN IT INTO A COOP GAME WHILE JUST TRYING TO GET AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE KIDS AT YOUR AGES WOULD HAVE FUN WITH IT JUST PLAYING THE WAY THE RULES ARE WRITTEN

MY KIDS ALSO REALLY ENJOY LOVE LETTER FLASK JUNK ART COCKROACH POKER CODENAMES PICTURES AS WELL AS THE ORIGINAL SUSHI GO AND PARTY ZOMBIE DICE THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT VERSIONS IF ZOMBIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AND TICKET TO RIDE JAIPUR AND MR JACK POCKET ARE ALSO GOOD AT THOSE AGES BUT ONLY 2 PLAYER JAIPUR IS GREAT TO START THE HOBBY WITH
I'M CONVINCED THE GAME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE KENNERSPIEL DES JAURES WINNER BROOM SERVICE THE GAME PLAYS UP TO PEOPLE IS A GOOD MIX OF STRATEGIC AND FUN AND HAS A THEME I THINK THAT CAN APPEAL TO YOUR DAUGHTERS
OTHER POSITIVES
COMES WITH TO INCREASE COMPLEXITY IF DESIRED
THEME COLORFUL BOARD
I BELIEVE ONE OF THE PODCAST HOSTS OF BLUE PEG PINK PEG HAD A SEGMENT ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER REALLY ENJOYING THE GAME

BASIC DESCRIPTION EACH PLAYER CONTROLS TWO WITCHES LOOKING TO DELIVER MAGIC POTIONS TO CASTLES IN EACH ROUND FROM THEIR OWN POOL OF CARDS IDENTICAL TO OTHER PLAYERS EACH PLAYER CHOOSES SECRETLY WHENEVER A PLAYER PLAYS A CARD THEY CHOOSE THE BRAVE ACTION BETTER OR THE COWARDLY ACTION SAFE NOT AS EFFECTIVE EVERYONE ELSE IN CLOCKWARD ORDER ALSO REVEALS IF THEY CHOSE THAT AS ONE OF THEIR FOR THE ROUND IF A PLAYER CHOOSES THE BRAVE ACTION ANY PLAYER BEFORE WHO ALSO CHOSE THE BRAVE ACTION INSTEAD GETS NO ACTION WHILE ANY PLAYER CHOOSING COWARDLY GETS TO IMMEDIATELY PERFORM THEIR ACTION

THE FIRST MINUTES OR SO MIGHT BE A LITTLE CONFUSING BUT THE GAMEPLAY IS VERY AFTER THE INITIAL CARD PLAYING IS UNDERSTOOD OF THE CARDS MANY OVERLAP IN THEIR FUNCTION WITH FEW DIFFERENTIATION
DEEP SEA ADVENTURE MAYBE IT'S A PUSH YOUR LUCK GAME

U GETINFO
RHINO HERO IS A FUN FAMILY GAME SO IS ESCAPE BUT THEY BOTH PLAY QUICK IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING BETTER SUITED FOR A FAMILY GAME NIGHT SETTING HONESTLY THERE ARE MANY GAMES THAT FIT THE BILL IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO WHAT KIND OF FAMILY THEY ARE AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER

DIXIT A SIMPLE STORY TELLING GAME TABLETOP PLAYED IT


SO THE OTHER DAY I BROUGHT BATTLE SHEEP TO THE FAMILY THANKSGIVING STARTED PLAYING IT WITH ADULTS AND THE KIDS LITERALLY FLOCKED TO IT AND GOT QUICKLY ADDICTED THERE WERE THREE GIRLS AND A BOY AGES ISH

I WAS SURPRISED HOW MUCH THEY LIKED IT BECAUSE IT'S AN ABSTRACT STRATEGY GAME THAT CAN BE MEAN WHEN YOU CUT OFF OTHER PLAYERS THEY LOVED THAT THOUGH AND WERE PROBABLY REALLY PULLED IN BY THE CUTE SHEEP TOKENS

IT'S NEAT BECAUSE IT APPEALS TO ADULTS AND KIDS

ONLY DOWNSIDE FOR YOUR SITUATION IS IT ONLY PLAYS UP TO
I'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THIS AS WELL IT'S FRUSTRATING HOW THIS PLACE CAN BE SOMETIMES

I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A REVIEW OF THE NEWEST VERSION OF THIS GAME THANKS FOR PROVIDING I ACTUALLY FOUND A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION AT A GARAGE SALE COMPLETE AND UNOPENED IT'S NEAT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE NEARLY UNPLAYABLE MY FRIEND AND I ENDED UP AT A STALEMATE BEFORE THE GAME EVEN ENTERED THE ENDGAME FROM WHAT I HEAR THE NEW VERSION DOES AWAY WITH THE MECHANIC THAT MADE THE ORIGINAL SO POINTLESS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR REVIEW
I THINK THE REASON YOU'VE YET TO HET ANY ANSWER IS THAT ALL OF THESE ARE GREAT AND QUITE SIMILAR IN COMPLEXITY AND FEEL ALSO I THINK IN MATTERS MUCH SINCE YOU HAVE ALL OF THEM AND SOONER OR LATER YOU'LL PLAY ALL OF THEM THAT SAID I'D GO WITH IMPERIAL ASSAULT I THINK THE INDIVIDUAL MISSIONS AREN'T TOO LONG AND THE GAME FLOWS WELL I'D RECOMMEND YOU READ THROUGH THE MISSION BEFORE PLAYING IT I'M ASSUMING YOU'LL BE PLAYING THE EMPIRE SO THINGS RUN SMOOTHLY MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE RULES WELL WE NEEDED A FEW CLARIFICATIONS DURING OUR GAMES

GO BUY A BUCKET OF PLASTIC ARMY MEN AND A MARBLE GET CREATIVE AND SET THEM UP ON TWO TEAMS AND TAKE TURNS ROLLING THE MARBLE AT THEM TO KNOCK THEM OVER

FLEXIBILITY VARIABILITY AND CHEAP MEETS YOUR GOAL OF DESTRUCTION WITHOUT PAYING FOR A FANCY BOARD GAME WITH LOADS OF RULES AND LIMITED DESTRUCTION
CODENAMES SEEMS LIKE A NO BRAINER HERE EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND CAN REALLY ACCOMMODATE AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU WANT I'D ALSO RECOMMEND FOR SALE IT'S A GREAT FILLER THAT IS EASY TO TEACH AND UNDERSTAND AND A FUN OF TON TO PLAY UNFORTUNATELY IT ONLY PLAYS UP TO BUT I THINK IT'S EXCELLENT
HOW HEAVY OF A GAME ARE YOU LOOKING FOR

FLUX IS LIGHT AND FAST SUPPORTS UP TO PLAYERS THERE A VARIETY OF THEMES FOR YOU TO CHOOSE FROM IT'S EASY TO LEARN TEACH AND IT PLAYS PRETTY FAST

GLOOM IS A PRETTY FUN GAME BUT I THINK YOU'D NEED THE CORE GAME AN EXPANSION TO DO FIVE PLAYERS

MUNCHKIN IS A PRETTY GREAT GAME FOR MID SIZE GROUPS ANYTIME I GET IT OUT I USUALLY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD TIME

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A HEAVIER GAME I WOULD VERY MUCH RECOMMEND ELDRITCH HORROR REALLY FUN WITH GROUPS OR YOU CAN EVEN PLAY IT SOLO LOT'S OF TEAMWORK INVOLVED IT'S A CHALLENGING GAME BUT IT IS A LOT OF FUN

MICE AND MYSTICS IS GREAT AS WELL IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE LIKE AN RPG BUT I THINK IT ONLY GOES UP TO PLAYERS I'M SURE SOMEONE HAS SOME HOMEBREWED STUFF FOR MORE PLAYERS THOUGH

I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ENJOY LOVE LETTER TOO SO THERE'S ANOTHER ONE YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT
BONANZA

DEEP SEA ADVENTURE

JUNK ART
BANG FAST PLAYING AND AT TIME HILARIOUS ALSO ITS MORE FUN TO CALL IT A PUNNABLE VS KNIFE
DIAMANT INCAN GOLD

SIMPLE PUSH YOUR LUCK GAME THAT PLAYS UP TO
DESCENT
IMPERIAL ASSAULT
MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME CG
MANSIONS OF MADNESS 2ND EDITION
VALERIA CARD KINGDOMS
THIS IS A LONG SHOT BUT IS IT TWIXT

BOARDGAME TWIXT
SURE SOUNDS LIKE TWIXT TO ME THE POSTS ARE RED AND BLACK AND THE BRIDGES ARE THE EXACT LENGTH OF A MOVE INVENTED BY THE GREAT ALEX RANDOLPH
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT I DON'T KNOW THE NAME SORRY
IF YOU CAN HOLD OFF FOR THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION I WOULD DO SO IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE TITLES LIKE CAVERN THAT CAN KEEP YOU SATED UNTIL THEN
I BOUGHT THE REVISED EDITION AND I LOVE IT THE ARTWORK AND SHAPED WOODEN PIECES FOR EVERYTHING ARE A UPDATE IN MY OPINION SURE YOU GET LESS CARDS BUT THEY'RE BALANCED AND I FIND I DON'T ALWAYS USE THEM ANYHOW THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIANTS IN THE MANUAL FOR DRAFTING DRAWING THAT MIGHT MAKE THE CARD USE MORE PREVALENT I'LL HAVE TO TRY THOSE SOON
FYI THE ANNIVERSARY DELUXE EDITION IS REPORTED TO BE AT LEAST
IF YOU REALLY WANT THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION YOU CAN JUST SELL TRADE YOUR ORIGINAL BEFORE IT COMES OUT

THE AMAN VERSION HAS MORE CARDS RESOURCES FOR ANOTHER PLAYER AND BOARDS FOR A FAMILY VARIANT THE MAYFAIR VERSION HAS LESS CARDS BUT BETTER CARD BALANCE ANIMAL SHAPED MEEDLESS AND NO FAMILY VARIANT
I'LL PIGGY BACK ON THIS THREAD

WHERE CAN I BUY AGRICOLA WITH THE CARD DECK I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY BLACK FRIDAY SALES AND IT SEEMS TO BE OUT OF STOCK OF SPECIAL ORDER AT MANY ONLINE VENDORS
BASED ON YOUR LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY GET THE REVISED EDITION I GOT IT MYSELF AND IT'S A REALLY GREAT VERSION OF THE GAME
MURDER THEM AND USE THE INSURANCE MONEY TO BUY A NEW FAMILY
SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST DON'T LIKE BOARDGAMES MAY BE BETTER TO GIVE UP AND FIND OTHER GROUPS ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE TRIED A LOT OF THE EASY TO LEARN GATEWAY GAMES AND THEY DIDN'T STICK
WOW SOUNDS ALOT LIKE MY RELATIVES AT THANKSGIVING NOW SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE BOARDGAMES BUT SINCE THEY LIKE CH IT MEANS THEY LIKE GAMES YOU JUST HAVEN'T FOUND THE RIGHT ONE YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THE TYPE OF GAMES YOUR RELATIVES GREW UP WITH THEY ARE SIMPLE ROLL AND MOVE TYPE GAMES WITH SIMPLE STRAIGHT FORWARD RULES SO WHAT WORKED FOR ME WAS STICKING TO PARTY GAMES AND LIGHT FILLER GAMES I'M BAD AT DESCRIBING GAMES SO ILL INCLUDE A LINK WHERE I CAN

SPIT IT OUT FUN LITTLE TRIVIA GAME WHERE PLAYER HAS TO GIVE WRONG ANSWERS TO VERY SIMPLE QUESTIONS BUT A DICE ROLL DETERMINES QUESTIONS PLAYER HAS TO ANSWER CORRECTLY SPIT IT OUT REVIEW

TIMES UP TITLE RECALL CALL IT A MODERN VERSION OF CHARADES WHERE YOU TRY TO GET YOUR PARTNER TO GUESS NAME OF TITLE MOVIE SONG ETC PLAYED IN THREE ROUNDS EACH ROUND LIMITS HOW YOU GIVE THE CLUES UP REVIEW

TELESTRATIONS ITS BASICALLY TELEPHONE AND DICTIONARY HAD A BABY

NO THANKS LIGHT LITTLE CARD GAME WHERE YOU TRY TO BUILD A SEQUENCE OF CARDS BY DECIDING TO TAKE A CARD OR PAY A CHIP TO PASSIVE NO THANKS REVIEW

TRURO I CALL IT A PATHFINDING GAME BASICALLY EACH PLAYER IS GIVEN TILES AND ON THEIR TURN LAY ONE TILE DOWN CREATING A PATH KEEPING YOUR TOKEN ON THE BOARD WHILE FORCING OTHER PLAYERS TOKEN OFF THE BOARD OR COLLIDE WITH ANOTHER PLAYER ELIMINATING BOTH WINNER IS THE LAST ONE REMAINING ON THE BOARD TRURO PLAYTHROUGH

THE TRICK TO GETTING OUT OF JUST PLAYING PARTY GAMES IS YOU NEED TO CONVERT SOME OF YOUR RELATIVES INTO MODERN BOARDGAME PLAYERS IT'S TOUGH TRYING TO TEACH GAMERS A NEW GAME MUCH LESS A GROUP NOT FAMILIAR WITH MODERN GAMES IF YOU HAVE A RELATIVE CLOSE BY MAYBE YOU COULD GET TOGETHER ONCE A MONTH HAVE DINNER AND GAME NIGHT START WITH GAMES LIKE SUSHI GO FORBIDDEN ISLAND LANTERNS ETC JUST A SIMPLE GAME THAT WILL GET THEM FAMILIAR WITH MODERN GAME MECHANICS SO THAT AT FAMILY GATHERINGS THEY CAN HELP EXPLAIN AND TEACH THE GAME TO THE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS

IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK OUT WITH SOME PEOPLE SADLY I AGREE THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH
I HAVE FOUND THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T PLAY BOARD GAMES AS A HOBBY TEND TO FIND THE WEALTH OF RULES CONFUSING SO PREFER SIMPLE TRIVIA GAMES OR VERY BASIC MECHANICS I AM SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T LIKE CODENAMES THAT HAS GONE DOWN WELL IN MY TESTS AS HAS CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY WHICH I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE AS A PARTY GAME BUT APPRECIATE IT ISN'T TO MUCH FAVOUR ON HERE

WHEN THEY ASK YOU TO BRING GAMES HAVE YOU ASKED THEM WHAT TYPE THEY WOULD LIKE WHAT THEME WOULD INTEREST THEM IF THEY ARE SCI-FI FANS THEN A SCI-FI BASED THEME WOULD HAVE THEM MORE INTERESTED IN LEARNING HOW TO PLAY

CAPTAIN SONAR COULD BE A GREAT ONE FOR MANY PLAYERS AND THE REAL TIME MODE ALTHOUGH INITIALLY DAUNTING COULD ACTUALLY BE THE THING THAT MAKES THEM ENJOY IT I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT MYSELF BUT I HEAR POSITIVE THINGS

TRURO IS A VERY SIMPLE GAME PLAYERS AND QUICK FUN

HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU USUALLY PLAYING WITH AT THANKSGIVING

PS THIS WAS ONE REALLY GOOD ARTICLE I FOUND ON EXPLAINING RULES TO PEOPLE
I HAVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH MY PARENTS THEY LIKE TO PLAY GAMES WHEN THEY COME OVER OR WHEN I VISIT BUT THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO GET SOME GAMES THEY ARE USED TO SIMPLE ABSTRACT GAMES OR CARD GAMES WITH NUMBERS AND COLORS ON THEM

MY FATHER IS A BRILLIANT MIND AND CRUSHES ALL OF US IN CHESS ETC BUT PUT SOME VERY LIGHT THEMING ON A GAME AND HE DOESN'T KNOW THE FRONT OF A CARD FROM ITS BACK MY MOTHER IS SIMILAR THOUGH SHE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE A BIT MORE THEME SHE STILL DOES WEIRD THINGS LIKE ACCUSING HERSELF OF BEING THE MURDERER IN DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG

WITH CODENAMES MY FATHER SOMETIMES FORGOT THAT HE'S ONLY SUPPOSED TO CLUE IN ON HIS OWN TEAMS WORDS COMPLETELY IGNORING THE CARD WITH THE TEAM COLORS AND ALL OF THIS IS AFTER THEY PLAYED A FEW ROUNDS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS

ANOTHER EXAMPLE HE UNDERSTOOD WELCOME TO THE DUNGEON THE SECOND I TOLD HIM TO COMPLETELY ABSOLUTELY TRULY IGNORE THE ARTWORK AND ONLY FOCUS ON THE NUMBERS THEN I WENT THROUGH THE ITEMS AND SAID SO THIS BEATS A THIS BEATS ALL EVEN CARDS AND SUDDENLY IT CLICKED FOR HIM UP UNTIL THIS POINT HE WAS JUST TOO CONFUSED BY THE THEME HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE MONSTERS ON THE CARDS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO
TRY SETTLERS CLASSIC GATEWAY GAME MY GRANDPA WHO ONLY EVER PLAYED CHESS HIS ENTIRE LIFE FELL IN LOVE WITH IT AT THE AGE OF
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS GAME SPECIFICALLY BUT COULDN'T YOU BAGGY EVERYTHING A CUSTOM FOAMCORE INSERT IS ALSO AN OPTION BUT IT CAN BE A BIT OF WORK
PUT THEM IN BAGS
YOU PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO GET THE MAJORITY OF THE GROUP TO 2 CARDS ON THE INTUITION TRACK TO HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OBVIOUSLY THE MORE THAT CAN SEE THREE THE BETTER AS SUCH THE PSYCHICS NEED TO GUESS WELL AND OFTEN DON'T FORGET THAT YOU GET YOUR GUESSING TOKENS BACK AT EITHER THE BEGINNING OR END OF THE FOURTH HOUR CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHICH ANOTHER BIG HELP THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE OVERLOOK IS THAT ONCE A PSYCHIC FIGURES OUT ALL THREE OF HIS CARDS HE GETS POINTS ON THE INTUITION TRACK EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF ROUNDS LEFT IN THE GAME
I ONLY PLAY GAMES BUT WE DON'T PLAY WITH THE CLAIRVOYANCY TRACK AT THE END ALL PSYCHICS SEE ALL THREE CARDS AND WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT THE CULPRIT THE GHOST ADDS IN MORE CULPRITS AS WELL TO MAKE IT HARDER AND WE'VE LOST QUITE A FEW PLAYING THIS WAY AS WELL
YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THIS PART BUT JUST WANTED TO BE SURE THE FIRST CARD REVEALED HAS TO DO WITH THE PERSON THE SECOND HAS TO DO WITH THE PLACE AND THE THIRD HAS TO DO WITH THE OBJECT SO IDEALLY IT SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY EASIER THAN A TYPICAL ROUND SINCE YOU NOT ONLY HAVE A CARD TO HINT AT YOUR PERSON BUT ANOTHER CARD TO CROSS REFERENCE THAT WITH WITH WHERE THAT PERSON WAS I E THIS CARD MAKES ME THINK THIS IS THE MAID BUT SHE WAS IN THE KITCHEN AND THIS NEXT CARD TOTALLY DOESN'T SAY KITCHEN TO ME AT ALL AND SOME PEOPLE MAY EVEN HAVE THAT THIRD CARD AND HAVE EVEN MORE TO REFERENCE IT AGAINST LASTLY AFTER YOU PLACE ANY HINT CARD AS THE GHOST YOU IMMEDIATELY DRAW ANOTHER SO YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE HOPE THAT HELPS
DON'T FORGET TO VISIT R LOTRLCG
I STARTED RECENTLY ALMOST DONE DWARRODELF I'VE JUST BEEN PLAYING IN ORDER STARTING WITH JUST CORE I EVENTUALLY MADE PROXIES IN LIEU OF MULTIPLE CORES VERSUS I'VE FOUND IT PREFERABLE BECAUSE

GETTING EVERYTHING AT ONCE IS REALLY OVERWHELMING I MAY BUY MULTIPLE PACKS AT ONCE BUT I JUST STORE THEM AWAY UNTIL I GET TO THEM BECAUSE HAVING THAT MANY CARDS AVAILABLE AT ONCE CAN BE PRETTY INTIMIDATING FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE ALL THE SAGAS AND AGAINST THE SHADOW CYCLE SITTING IN PLASTIC WRAP SOMEWHERE PICKED UP ON SALE

2 I GET TO LEARN EVERYTHING THE GAME HAS TO OFFER WITHOUT FEELING LIKE I'M CHEATING OR USING NET DECKS

I CAN BUILD A DECK FOR AN ADVENTURE PLAY IN TIMES TILL I'VE MASTERED IT AND THEN BREAK DOWN THE DECK AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ADVENTURE KEEPS THINGS FRESH SINCE I'M CONSTANTLY BUILDING DIFFERENT DECKS

I'VE ENJOYED HAVING EVERYTHING SO FAR EVEN THE KIRKWOOD CYCLE CARDS THE ADVENTURES ARE OFTEN KINDA MPH AND THE CARDS CAN BE HIT OR MISS BUT SOME CAN BE GREAT OR FIND RENEWED USES LATER
LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A SIZABLE COLLECTION BASED ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO SELL SO I'LL SHARE SOME RESOURCES ABOUT GETTING INTO THE GAME

THE FTC BUYING GUIDE HAS A LOT OF INFO ABOUT THE EXPANSION MODEL AND RATINGS FOR EACH ONE

PATH IS A DECKBUILDING GUIDE STARTING FROM THE CORE AND PROGRESSING UP THROUGH THE FIRST CYCLE AND SOME CHANGE THIS HAS MORE BUILD AND PLAY TIPS THAN THE BUYING GUIDE

AND I STARTED POSTING A FEW STARTER DECKS ALONGSIDE MY WEEKLY DECK SERIES RECENTLY YOU CAN FIND THOSE HERE ON RINGSIDE THEY'RE MEANT TO GET NEW PLAYERS STARTED WITH RELATIVELY FEW EXPANSIONS AND A SOLID DECK TO PLAY THE GAME WITH I'M PLANNING ON DOING ANOTHER ONE FEATURING THE CORE SET AND THE NEWEST DELUXE EXPANSION NEXT TUESDAY THOUGH THAT MIGHT BE DELAYED A BIT IF THE POST OFFICE ISN'T ON TOP OF THINGS TODAY
IVE GOTTEN IN TO CGS OF WHICH WERE AFTER THEY'D ALREADY BEEN OUT FOR A WHILE THE WAY I LIKE TO DO IT IS TO SIMPLY PLAY IN RELEASE ORDER SO YOU GET THE CORE OBVIOUSLY AND SEE IF YOU LIKE IT THEN IF YOU DO YOU GET THE NEXT FULL CYCLE OF CARDS THE EXPANSION THEN THAT SHOULD KEEP YOU OCCUPIED FOR A GOOD LONG WHILE AND ONCE YOU FEEL YOU'VE PLAYED THAT OUT AND YOU'RE READY TO SHAKE THINGS UP AGAIN YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT CYCLE EXPANSION

I DO IT THIS WAY TO SIMULATE THE SHIFTS IN META AS THE GAME EVOLVED OVER TIME IF YOU HAVE EVERYTHING AVAILABLE TO YOU IT'S TOO EASY TO JUST BUILD WITH THE BEST CARDS THE GAME HAS TO OFFER BY GOING IN RELEASE ORDER AND ARTIFICIAL LIMITING YOUR POOL OF CARDS YOU FORCE YOURSELF TO USE CARDS THAT WERE GOOD FOR THAT ERA EVEN IF THEY'RE OBSOLETE NOW YOU GET TO BUILD DECKS THAT MAY NOT EVEN EXIST ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY WERE GOOD WHEN THOSE CARDS WERE STILL PRETTY NEW

THAT'S JUST HOW I DO IT THOUGH IT MAKES SENSE TO ME BUT REALLY THE BIG POINT TO DRIVE HOME IS TO NOT USE EVERYTHING AT ONCE YOU CAN BUY EVERYTHING AT ONCE BUT TRY TO LIMIT HOW MUCH YOU'RE USING DRIP IT OUT OVER TIME TO REALLY GET THE MOST OF EVERYTHING YOU CONTROL THE WAY YOU EXPERIENCE THESE GAMES
I BOUGHT BIG USED COLLECTION FOR BARGAIN SOLD IT SOON AFTER AND MADE MONEY
PROBLEM IS WHEN BUYING BIG COLLECTION BUILDING DECK IS SUCH A HASSEL THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF CARDS YOU HAVE IDEA HAVE HALF OF THE STUFF WORKS AND YOU CAN SPEND MORE ON DECK BUILDING THAN ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME WE DISLIKED THAT VERY MUCH AND HALF OF THE TIME YOU MIGHT WANNA TWEAK YOUR DECK DEPENDING ABOUT WHICH SCENARIO YOU PLAY SO YOU SPEND EVEN MORE TIME ON DECK BUILDING GOING THROUGH ALL THESE CARDS SIMPLY ALL THOSE OPTIONS ARE OVERWHELMING FOR YOU WHEN YOU START AND TRYING SORT THROUGH IT TO UNLOCK CARDS HOW YOU PLAY IS ALSO HUGE TIME INVESTMENT
GAME IS GOOD I AM LIKING THEME IF NEW EXPANSIONS UNFORTUNATELY I WON'T BE PLAYING THEM

ALTHOUGH MARKHAM CG IS HERE AND I AM STARTING THIS FROM BEGINNING SO IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER I HOPE SLOWLY BRIDLING AND PLAYING IT

LOAR CG IS GREAT GAME BUT THERE ARE DOWNSIDES TO BUYING GAME BUNCH OF IT IN A SINGLE SWOOP
AS OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED CHECK OUT R LOTRLCG ALSO I RECOMMEND STARTING WITH ONE BASE SET AND SLOWLY ADDING CONTENTION NOT THAT YOU HAVE TO START WITH EARLY STUFF BUT I THINK IT'D BE EASY TO BE OVERWHELMED AND LOSE THE SENSE OF DISCOVERY AND THRILL WHEN OPENING NEW PACKS AND IMAGINING THE POSSIBILITIES THAT THE CARDS OPEN UP

ALSO AS A SHAMELESS PLUG I DID A FULL WRITTEN REVIEW OF THE GAME WHICH IS ON MY SITE
IM GONA ASK A QUESTION THAT MIGHT HELP OP WHEN HE GETS IN TO IT AND WOULD HELP ME HOW DO PEOPLE STORE THEIR CARDS
DO YOU LUMP ALL THE LORE IN TOGETHER TACTICS TOGETHER AND SO ON OR DO YOU STORE THEM AS THEY WERE RELEASED IN SEPARATE PACKS

I FIND IT KINDA INTIMIDATING TRAWLING THROUGH A LARGE SET OF CARDS TO CHOOSE JUST A FEW IF I HAD ALL THE LORE TOGETHER ID BE DEBILITATED
I HAVE THE CORE GAME AND A RANDOM EXPANSION THE FOURTH THAT I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY IF YOU WANT TO START SMALL
I WILL PM YOU A FRIEND OF LOCAL LISTING IT'S ABOUT OF STUFF FOR GOING IN RELEASE ORDER PERFECT COLLECTION
I'M GETTING RID OF THE BOX SET A BUNCH OF THE SMALL EXPANSIONS AND THE FIRST BIG BOX EXPANSION MINES OF ANDOR I CAN GET SPECIFICS IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED
LOAR CG IS MY FAVORITE GAME I GOT INTO IT A FEW MONTHS AGO IT'S BEST TO GET A CORE TO TRY IT OUT IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN EITHER GO IN ORDER OF RELEASE OR GO IN ORDER OF THE SAGA EXPANSIONS IF YOU LIKE THE GAME IT IS GENERALLY RECOMMENDED YOU GET A SECOND CORE OR PROXY THEM I HAVE 2 CORES AND WOULDN'T MIND A 3RD IF IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY CHEAP
MY ADVICE PLAY PROGRESSION STYLE IT'S REALLY THE BEST WAY TO EXPERIENCE THE GAME AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET INTO THE META I LISTEN TO COER CARDBOARD OF THE RINGS SO I CAN LISTEN ALONG TO HOW THE GAME WAS AT THE TIME COER WILL GET YOU UP TO THE END OF THE SECOND CYCLE SINCE I THINK THAT'S WHEN SITES LIKE TALES FROM THE CARDS AND PATH STARTED

BASICALLY JUST IMMERSE YOURSELF INTO THE EXPERIENCE AND YOU'LL HAVE A BLAST LOAR IS EASILY MY FAVORITE GAME AND I PLAY IT WAY MORE THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD MY GAME CONSOLES ARE JUST GATHERING DUST NOWADAYS
IT'S SIMILARLY SIMPLE AND EQUALLY CHARMING FOR THE MONEY IT'S WORTH IT
DEEP SEA ADVENTURE ROLL AND MOVE PUSH YOUR LUCK
AS A SMALL FILLER ZOMBIE DICE

VERY LIGHT RULES CAN BE EXPLAINED IN LESS THAN SECONDS IT WON'T TAKE MORE THAN MINUTES AND IT'S THE DEFINITION OF A PRESS YOUR LUCK GAME

CONS IT'S A FILLER DON'T EXPECT TO ENTERTAIN A GROUP ALL NIGHT WITH IT
ALL YOU NEED IS DICE AND YOU HAVE BARKLE THEY SELL ACTUAL GAMES BUT ITS LITERALLY JUST DICE AND A CUP THE CUP ISNT NECESSARY AT ALL TAKES LESS THAN MINUTES TO EXPLAIN
PASS THE PIGS IS OUR GROUPS FAVORITE PRESS YOUR LUCK GAME AND THE PIG SHAPED DICE ARE AWESOME ALSO MAKES A GREAT DRINKING GAME
WE'VE HAD SOME FUN GAMES OF CAN'T STOP MIGHT BE WORTH A LOOK MAX PLAYERS THOUGH

BOARDGAME
INCAN GOLD IS AN AMAZING PRESS YOUR LUCK GAME THAT IS SUPER EASY TO TEACH AND LEARN
KING OF TOKYO
THIS MAY BE LIGHTER THAN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT STRIKE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DICE CHUCKING PUSH YOU LUCK GAMES U GETINFO
ZOMBIE DICE IS SORT OF LIKE THAT YOU ROLL DICE AT A TIME TO TRY AND COLLECT BRAINS IF YOU GET SHOTGUNNED TIMES IN ONE TURN YOU LOSE ALL THE BRAINS YOU COLLECTED DURING THAT TURN BUT YOU CAN DECIDE BEFORE YOU ROLL AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BRAINS YOU'VE GOT OR ROLL AGAIN AND POSSIBLY LOSE THEM ALL WE USE IT AS A SHORT WARM UP GAME USUALLY BUT WE'VE ALSO PLAYED WITH ABOUT OR PEOPLE BEFORE
CASTLE DICE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES THE FACTOR COMES WITH THE CARDS THAT ALLOW YOU TO REROLL OR PICK AND ROLL AGAIN SOMETIMES YOU GET SOMETHING GOOD OTHER TIMES YOU ARE LEAVING SOMETHING BETTER FOR EVERYONE ELSE THE EXPANSION IS ALSO PRETTY NEAT IF YOU PREFER CATERED DECKS WITH A BUILT THEME AS OPPOSED TO ONLY COMMUNITY DECKS WHERE YOU GET WHAT YOU GET
IT'S A FANTASTIC GAME AND I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT I CAN REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY LIKE THE D D UNIVERSE IT'S A FANTASTIC HIGHLY INTERACTIVE DECK BUILDER AREA CONTROL THIS EXPANSION WENT IMMEDIATELY ON MY MUST BUY LIST
OHMYGOSH I AM SO EXITED THIS GAME WAS DESIGNED WITH EXPANSIONS IN MIND IT SEEMS BUT MY HUSBAND AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPEN AFTER THE GAME RELEASED WITH SUCH A HIGH PRICE POINT AND IT SEEMED TO NOT GET AN EARLY FOLLOWING BECAUSE IF IT


THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF FANTASTIC THANK YOU
I REALLY ENJOY TYRANTS AND THIS EXPANSION ALONE WILL ADD ENOUGH VARIETY TO LAST A LONG LONG TIME
THESE EXPANSIONS WERE PROBABLY REDESIGNED ALONG WITH THE BASE GAME AND IT WAS DECIDED BEFOREHAND THAT THESE WOULD BE RELEASED ANYWAY THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER NEW ONES WILL BE DESIGNED NOW
I FEEL THAT IF ALL THE GOOD GAMES ARE ON ONE SHELF ALL ATTENTION WILL BE FOCUSED ON JUST THIS ONE PARTICULAR SHELF

ALL OF THOSE OTHER GAMES ON THE THAT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT TO BE ON THE GOOD SHELF ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE NEGLECTED IN THE FUTURE SOON YOU'LL FORGET ABOUT THEM ENTIRELY UNTIL YOU ADD IT TO THE FOR TRADE LIST ON YOUR BG PROFILE
IT'S KIND OF LIKE IN TOY STORY WHEN ANDY CHOOSES WOODY TO TAKE TO COLLEGE WHILE ALL THE OTHER TOYS ARE PUT IN A BAG FOR THE ATTIC
SUPERFICE COLLECTION WE COULD DEFINITELY GET ALONG

HOW DO YOU FIND HEGEMONIC AND YOU'VE MISTAKENLY PUT MERCHANTS AND MARAUDERS TOO LOW XD
IT'S A POOR GAME BY JUST ABOUT ANY MEASURE SAD TO SAY BUT THE FIRST EDITION IS LITERALLY THE FIRST HISTORICAL WARGAME PUBLISHED
LORDS OF AIDIT HAS A KNOCK OUT TYPE SCORING WHERE YOU FIRST CONSIDER ONE ASPECT AND THE LOWEST SCORE IS REMOVED AND THEN YOU CONTINUE IN THAT MANNER UNTIL THE WINNER IS FOUNDATION THE ORDER IS RANDOMIZED EACH GAME
THE NEW ARCADIA QUEST INFERNO RULES HE WHO KILLS LORD FANG IS RULER OF THE CITY HE WITH THE MOST BADGES IS THE POWER BEHIND THE THRONE
PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING OF BUT IN PANIC ON WALL STREET THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO WINNERS THE RICHEST MANAGER AND THE RICHEST INVESTOR BASICALLY IT'S BECAUSE THE TWO TYPES OF ROLES PLAY DIFFERENTLY AND BRINGS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU GET
I KNOW IT WON'T HELP YOU AS YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY IT AND IT'S PROBABLY SIMPLER THAN WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BUT HERE IN BRAZIL THERE'S A CARD GAME THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED THIS YEAR CALLED CONTAGIA IN WICH YOU PLAY CARDS REPRESENTING CHARACTERS WITH DIFFERENT SCORING AND ABILITIES IN ORDER TO WRITE YOUR OWN FAIRY TALES AND AT THE END OF THE GAME THE PLAYERS WITH THE HAPPIEST AND THE SADDEST STORY MOST AND LEAST POINTS WIN THE GAME
IT'S NOT QUITE WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING BUT THE GAME SHADOW HUNTERS HAS A SYSTEM OF HIDDEN ROLES THAT EACH HAVE THEIR OWN WIN CONDITIONS FOR THE TWO MAIN FACTIONS SHADOWS AND HUNTERS YOUR WIN CONDITION IS JUST TO ELIMINATE THE OTHER TEAM BUT WITH PLAYERS THE GAME ALSO HAS HIDDEN NEUTRAL CHARACTERS WHOSE WIN CONDITIONS ARE ACHIEVED INDEPENDENTLY BUT ARE OFTEN PROACTIVE ENOUGH THAT THEY WILL ALLY WITH ONE SIDE OR ANOTHER OR EVEN SWITCH SIDES MIDWAY THEREFORE IT'S POSSIBLE FOR ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL CHARACTERS TO WIN INDEPENDENTLY BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH OTHER PLAYERS PLAYERS CAN EVEN WIN AFTER BEING ELIMINATED AS LONG AS THEIR FACTION WON WHICH MITIGATES SOME OF THE MOMENTS OF PLAYER ELIMINATION

THERE'S ALSO SOME GAMES LIKE DUNGEON LORDS WHICH GIVE YOU POINTS FOR HAVING THE BEST MOST X AT THE END OF THE GAME BUT THOSE POINTS JUST GO TOWARDS A LARGER TALLY SO IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME

SCYTHE REWARDS YOU FOR BEING THE BEST AT A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE BY GIVING YOU AN ACHIEVEMENT AND THE GAME ENDS WHEN A PLAYER REACHES ACHIEVEMENTS BUT THAT PLAYER ISN'T NECESSARILY THE WINNER POINTS ARE SCORED FOR ACHIEVEMENTS AS WELL AS YOUR END OF GAME MONEY AND OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN GENERAL SANDBOX GAMES MIGHT BE THE TYPE OF THING CLOSEST TO WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING

LASTLY EVEN THOUGH THE LORDS OF AIDIT RECOMMENDATION BELOW DOESN'T SEEM QUITE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT'S LESS ABOUT BEING THE BEST AT ONE THING AND MORE ABOUT NOT BEING THE WORST AT ANYTHING IT'S A GREAT GAME WITH A GOOD MECHANIC THAT I CAN THOROUGHLY RECOMMEND
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING THERE ARE CERTAIN ALIENS IN COSMIC ENCOUNTER THAT GIVE YOU A UNIQUE WIN CONDITION CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD HAS I THINK THREE POSSIBLE WIN CONDITIONS AND ONE LOSE CONDITION OR I GUESS A LOT OF CO-OP GAMES WHERE PEOPLE WIN OR LOSE AS A GROUP AND EACH PERSON HAS TO PLAY TO THEIR UNIQUE STRENGTHS LIKE HAVING PATRICE FOCUS ON HUNTING DOWN ALL THE CLUES WHILE MOSTLY LEAVING MONSTER CLEANUP TO SKIDS AND YORICK IN MARKHAM HORROR
KINGDOM BUILDER AWARDS POINTS FOR VARIOUS CONDITIONS AT THE END OF THE GAME SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM AWARDS POINTS TO PLAYERS WHO HAVE THE MOST OF EACH TYPE OF CARD AT THE END THOSE GAMES STILL HAVE ONE WINNER AT THE END BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATHS TO VICTORY
PEOPLE REALLY DON'T LIKE NOT HAVING AN OUT RIGHT WINNER SO NOT SURE HOW POPULAR THIS IDEA COULD BE THERE ARE ALWAYS FOLKS IN THE TIE BREAKER THREADS WHO GET PLAIN MEAN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T MIND SHARING A WIN AND WHEN I BROUGHT UP HOW GALAXY TRUCKER SAYS EVERYONE WHO MADE A PROFIT WON THE GAME I ACTUALLY GOT A RUDE PM
BLUEPRINTS WORKS EXACTLY LIKE THIS OF A SEQUENCE OF PRIZES IN A ROUND
ANIS HAS THREE WIN CONDITIONS DOMINATE FIGURES FROM OTHER PLAYERS CONTROL AN AREAS WITH SANCTUARIES AND BE PRESENT IN AREAS TIES BETWEEN WINS PROCLAIMED IN THE SAME ROUND GO TO THE CONTROLLER OF THE MAIN CITY
ALL COIN GAMES SCORE EACH FACTION IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT ONLY ONE CAN WIN WHICHEVER PLAYER HAS SURPASSED THEIR TARGET BY THE MOST
YES ITS CALLED THE US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
EVERY GAME IS LIKE THIS IF YOU BUY A SMALL PACKAGE OF PLASTIC PARTICIPATION TROPHIES AND HAND ONE OUT TO EVERYONE AT THE END

NO I CAN'T THINK OF ANY
STONE AGE IF YOU WANT A LIGHT EURO IT'S BASICALLY AGRICOLA LIGHT DARK MOON IF YOU WANT BETRAYAL ALL YOU DO IS READ A CARD AND ROLL DICE THE REST IS ALL SOCIAL

MAYBE WONDERS COULD WORK TOO
REMEMBER NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO LIKE BOARD GAMES SOUNDS LIKE YOUR BOYFRIENDS FAMILY PREFER LIGHT AND CASUAL GAMES I WOULDN'T EXPECT TO BE PLAYING DEAD OF WINTER WITH THEM ANYTIME SOON ALSO DON'T LET THEM NOT GETTING LOVE LETTER DETER YOU MY MOM INITIALLY COULDN'T WRAP HER HEAD AROUND IT BUT HANAFI CLICKED FOR HER RIGHT AWAY DON'T WORRY THERE'S STILL HOPE YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND THE RIGHT GAME CODENAMES IS A GOOD START

SUSHI GO PARTY YOU COULD ALSO GO WITH REGULAR SUSHI GO BUT THE PARTY VERSION GIVES YOU MORE OPTIONS TO CUSTOMIZE THE TYPE OF GAME YOU WANT

HARE TORTOISE A BETTING RACING GAME HAS BEEN A HIT WITH SOME OF MY NON GAMER FAMILY MEMBERS

HEY THAT'S MY FISH IT MAY LOOK LIKE A KIDS GAME BUT THIS IS MOST CUTTHROAT GAME I OWN BIG HIT WITH MY TWO UNCLES WHO DON'T PLAY BOARD GAMES BUT ARE SUPER COMPETITIVE 2 THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND SET UP IS A BIT FIDDLY AND THIS GAME HAS CAUSED SEVERAL HEATED ARGUMENTS

THESE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF SUGGESTION I HAVE MORE BUT IM ON MY PHONE SO ILL LIST THEM WHEN I GET HOME

HAVE YOU TRIED GAMES WITH A THEME THEY REALLY ENJOY

COLT EXPRESS OKAY NOW THIS ONE IS IFFY BUT IF THEY LIKE WESTERN MOVIES OR WESTERN THEMES IT MIGHT BE WORTH A GO IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE ONE OR TWO PLAYS BEFORE IT CLICKS FLICK EM UP IS ANOTHER ONE THAT COME TO MIND BUT I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT

LAST NIGHT ON EARTH IT'S A MOVIE IN BOARD GAME FORM IT'S BEEN HIT OR MISS BASICALLY FOR THOSE THAT GET INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE GAME THEY ENJOY IT

ARE THERE ANY CLASSIC BOARD GAMES THAT THEY PLAY REGULARLY CLUE MONOPOLY SCRABBLE ETC IF SO THE DICE TOWER DID A TOP OF BETTER GAMES TO TRY IT IS A BIT DATED BUT STILL SHOULD WORK FOR YOU
I'VE HAD FANTASTIC LUCK WITH MY FAMILY STARTING WITH SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS AND MOVING INTO SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM AND TR THEY NOW OWN AND HAVE WORN OUT DECKS OF CARDS ON TR

ALL THAT SAID DON'T GET TOO DISCOURAGED IF IT DOESN'T TAKE NOT EVERYONE IS A GAMER OR MEANT TO BECOME ONE MY FATHER TOLERATES TR BECAUSE THE REST OF MY FAMILY LOVES IT BUT HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY LIKE BOARDGAMES MY MOTHER LIKES TO PLAY ON OCCASION BUT WOULD NEVER SUGGEST PLAYING UNLESS MY WIFE AND I ARE THERE MY SISTER AND HER HUSBAND HOWEVER HAVE BEEN CONVERTED

SHRUG

IT IS WHAT IT IS NOT EVERYONE IS MEANT TO GAME
DELETED
MASMORRA DUNGEONS OF ARCADIA SEEMS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR I WAS LOOKING FOR IT TOO WILL BUY IT SOON STILL HAVE TO READ MORE ABOUT IT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
MAGE KNIGHT MIGHT FIT THE BILL HERE ALSO MENTION GLOOMHAVEN

GLOOMHAVEN DEFINITELY GET GLOOMHAVEN IT LOOKS TO BE THE BEST DUNGEON CRAWLER EVER
DUNGEON DICE
I REALLY LIKE MICE AND MYSTICS
DUNGEONQUEST NEVER WILL YOU HAVE SO MUCH FUN RANDOMLY DYING SOMETIMES YOU EVEN GET TREASURE
SWORD SORCERY IS COMING SOON AS WELL AS GLOOMHAVEN

BOTH LOOK TO BE GREAT DUNGEON CRAWLS BUT THEY AREN'T RELEASED QUITE YET
YOU NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC DO YOU WANT A FULL-BLOWN CAMPAIGN STANDALONE SCENARIOS HOW MANY PLAYERS LIGHT OR HEAVY WEIGHT HOW ABOUT PLAYTIME WHAT SETTING
NOT DESCENT OR IND ONLY JUST NARROWS IT DOWN TO ABOUT A THOUSAND DIFFERENT OPTIONS
AMAZON ALSO HAS IT AS I'VE SEEN AS LOW AS ON AMAZON AS WELL
THE PROBLEM THERE IS WALMART
WALMART HAS PANDEMIC
GOOD DEAL BEING A RELATIVELY NEW BOARD GAMER OUTSIDE OF THE USUAL MONOPOLY ETC PICKED UP TICKET TO RIDE CATAN AND PANDEMIC AT TARGET A COUPLE WEEKS BACK FOR A BUY 2 GET FREE I'M GETTING ADDICTED TO BOARD GAMES NOW THAT I REALIZE THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD ONES OUT THERE THAT I HAD NO IDEA EXISTED HAVE SINCE PICKED UP ROBINSON CRUSOE AND STAR WARS MINIATURES I'M CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR SALES ON GAMES NOW THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS CONVINCING THE WIFE AND KIDS TO PLAY WITH ME
I THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH EXPANSIONS THAT THE DECK CONSTRUCTION ASPECT WILL KEEP IT FRESH YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY NEW OPTIONS
IF YOU'RE LOOKING INTO COMPETITIVE IT WILL BECOME STALE ANY CARD GAME THAT DOESN'T GET CONSTANT FRESH INFLUX OF CARDS WILL UNFORTUNATELY DIE AT THE FAGS LEVEL

HOWEVER IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PLAYING CASUALLY THEN I THINK IT'S WORTH PICKING IT UP THAT'S WHAT I DID I ONLY SEEK TO PLAY IT CASUALLY SO I PICKED UP THE CORE SET SOME EXPANSIONS AND THEN TRY TO DO MY BEST WAAARGH IMPRESSIONS IT'S A VERY GOOD GAME
I PICKED UP THE CORE SET RECENTLY AND I'VE HAD A BLAST WITH IT JUST A FUN 2 PLAYER STRATEGY GAME WITH THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE GAMES I'LL BRING OUT ONCE IN WHILE FOR FRIENDS
I'D GUESS GLOSSY RATHER THAN MATTE
I HAVE A SCOTCH BRAND LAMINATOR I USE APACHE BRAND CRYSTAL CLEAR FINISH LAMINATION MATERIAL I GOT IT ALL FROM AMAZON

I MADE SOME DASHBOARDS FOR FORMULA DE THAT WORK REALLY WELL WITH DRY ERASE MARKERS OR GREASE PENCILS
I'VE PRINTED A SCORE CARD FOR SCORING IN ROCOCO AND HAD IT LAMINATED AT STAPLES THAT'S AN OFFICE SUPPLY STORE IN THE UNITED STATES FIRST I HAD IT PRINTED ON CARD STOCK

IT'S REALLY STURDY

I CAN MARK ON THE CARD WITH A GREASE PENCIL CHINA MARKER IT'S PRETTY MUCH A FANCY CRAYON BUT MADE FOR WRITING ON GLASS AND PORCELAIN LIKE PLATES AND BOWLS HENCE THE NAME CHINA MARKER I COULD JUST AS EASILY USE A DRY ERASE MARKER IF I WANTED TO

THE ADVANTAGE TO USING A GREASE PENCIL OVER A DRY ERASE MARKER IS THAT WHILE IT'S EASILY ERASABLE WITH A SOFT TISSUE IT WON'T ACCIDENTALLY RUB OF ONTO OTHER GAME COMPONENTS
I WOULD USE IT WILL LAY FLAT AND THERE IS REALLY NO REASON TO GO THICKER PLUS YOUR AVERAGE CHEAP LAMINATOR CAN HANDLE THAT THICKNESS JUST FINE

BUT WORD OF WARNING THE INK USED IN MARKERS CAN EASILY TRANSFER TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND ISN'T ALWAYS EASY TO REMOVE ON SOMETHING LIKE PLASTIC YOU ARE GOOD BUT ON CARDBOARD WHICH IS POROUS AND CAN TRAP THOSE PARTICLES IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE AND THE COMPONENTS MAY APPEAR DIRTY OVERTIME

PERSONALLY I LIKE USING PLASTIC CHIPS GREEN AND RED TO COVER ACTIVATED AND UNAVAILABLE MILESTONES

THE UNIVERSAL LOVE FOR GAME OF THRONES EXCEPT FOR ME ALWAYS SURPRISES ME THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN A DECORATION ON THE SHELF IF ANYONE WANTS TO TRADE I'M HERE
IF YOU THINK ECLIPSE MIGHT BE TOO LONG THEN I THINK YOU CAN CROSS OFF TWILIGHT IMPERIUM
SOUNDS LIKE MARE NOSTRUM EMPIRES YOU WOULD NEED THE EXPANSION FOR THE 6TH PLAYER THO GAME OF THRONES ALSO CHECKS ALL THE POINTS
EMET SOUNDS LIKE IT FITS THE BILL BLOOD RAGE IS ALSO PRETTY BADASS
MAYBE NOT TWILIGHT IMPERIUM QUARTERMASTER GENERAL PERHAPS
SMALL WORLD MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT WORKS WELL WITH DIFFERENT PLAYER COUNTS AND THERE'S A GOOD DEAL OF STRATEGY AND DECISION MAKING WITHOUT IT BEING OVERWHELMING LIKE TI ALL THE GAMES I'VE PLAYED HAVE TAKEN LESS THAN MINS

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING SPACE THEMED AND DON'T MIND SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY STAR TREK ASCENDANCY IS PRETTY MANAGEABLE IT'S A THAT NEEDS EXACTLY PLAYERS BUT SOME EXPANSIONS ARE COMING OUT IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS THAT WILL UP THE PLAYER COUNT TO IT'S A GREAT GAME AND DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE AND IT HAS MUCH MORE DIPLOMACY THAN SMALL WORLD PLUS ITS RULES ARE PRETTY MANAGEABLE AND IT TAKES ABOUT HOURS TOPS IF EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY
I LOVE COSMIC ENCOUNTER AND TWILIGHT IMPERIUM AND RECOMMEND THEM IN GENERAL BUT IN TERMS OF THOSE SPECIFIC CRITERIA COSMIC ISN'T REALLY A WARGAME AND TWILIGHT IMPERIUM TAKES LIKE HOURS MINIMUM WITH ONLY PLAYERS WHO ARE RELATIVELY EXPERIENCED WITH THE RULES ALSO I BELIEVE SMALL WORLD IS A BIT ON THE LIGHT SIDE AND ONLY PLAYS ALTHOUGH I'M PRETTY SURE THEY HAVE A 6TH PLAYER EXPANSION

IF YOU'VE GOT THE BUDGET I'D SAY EMET FOR PLAYERS AND REX FOR OR FORBIDDEN STARS FOR AND REX FOR


DEFINITELY WORTH PICKING UP THE AMOUNT OF GAMES THAT PEOPLE HAVE PORTED IN IS STAGGERING IT ALSO JUST MAKES PLAYING THAT GAMES EASIER
I HAVE USED IT TO PLAY BOARD GAMES ONLINE WITH SOME FRIENDS WHEN WE WERE UNABLE TO GET TOGETHER IN PERSON PEOPLE MOVED AWAY ETC IT WORKS PERFECTLY THE CONTROLS MAY TAKE A BIT OF GETTING USED TO BUT ARE PRETTY INTUITIVE AND FAIRLY POWERFUL AND PEOPLE HAVE PUT IN AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF EFFORT TO IMPORT THE TEXTURES AND EVERYTHING SO THAT YOU CAN EVEN PLAY A VERY INTRICATE GAME LIKE MAGE KNIGHT BY SIMPLY DOWNLOADING THE APPROPRIATE MODULE FROM THE STEAM WORKSHOP I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MANY OTHER POSSIBILITIES GAMES WITH SOME AUTOMATION AND SCRIPTED EVENTS AND SUCH BUT FOR ME IT WAS WORTH GETTING THIS JUST TO BE ABLE TO PLAY GAMES WITH FRIENDS ONLINE ALMOST AS THOUGH WE'RE SITTING AT THE SAME TABLE
TABLETOP SIMULATOR IS BRILLIANT VERY INTUITIVE TO USE AND IS FANTASTIC FOR QUICKLY PLAYING ANYTHING WITH A LONG SETUP TIME MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENT IN THE STEAM WORKSHOP ONLY THE NEWER OR MORE OBSCURE GAMES ARE UNAVAILABLE

THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I CAN THINK OF IS YOU NEED FRIENDS DEDICATED TO PLAYING WITH YOU ONLINE SPEAKING OF WHICH IF ANYONE WANTS TO PLAY ON TTS SLING ME A PM AND I'LL ADD YOU ON STEAM
I REALLY WISH THEY MARKETED THE GAME BASED ON HOW IT'S AN AWESOME WAY TO PLAY BOARD GAMES ONLINE INSTEAD OF TABLE FLIP LUUUULZZZZZZZZZZZ XDDDDDD
AMAZING WAY TO TRY OUT GAMES YOU'RE THINKING OF BUYING MY COLLECTION HAS GROWN A LOT SINCE I BOUGHT TTS IT'S ALSO HELPED MY AVOID GAMES I WAS EXCITED ABOUT BUT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE AS GREAT AS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE
THINKING OF PICKING THIS UP IF I DID WOULD ANYONE BE INTERESTED IN A WEEKLY GAME MEDIUM TO HEAVY EURO GAMES ON THURSDAY NIGHT EST MY HUSBAND HAS HIS IND GROUP AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO PLAY SOME GAMES AT THE SAME TIME
HASN'T IT BEEN OFF IN EVERY SINGLE SALE SINCE ITS LAUNCH
CAN YOU PLAY AGAINST AI WITH TTS OR DOES IT REQUIRE YOU CONNECT WITH REAL PEOPLE
DO THE OTHER PLAYERS NEED TO OWN THE GAME TO BE ABLE TO PLAY OR JUST THE GM AND THE REST OF THE PLAYERS GET ADDED IN AS KIND OF A JACKBOX SITUATION WITH A PASSCODED ROOM OR SOMETHING
CAN'T WAIT TO GET TOUCH FOR RIFT THIS WILL BE AWESOME
DEFINITELY WORTH IT AT THAT PRICE IT'S A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO IN PERSON BUT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FIND PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH UNLESS YOU HAVE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WITH TS I DON'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE WITH IT AND FIND IT HARD TO FIND PUBLIC GAMES TO PLAY AT TIMES

SPEAKING OF WHICH I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW PEOPLE AND GAMES TO PLAY PM ME IF YOU'RE ON TS AND NEED PLAYERS
A FRIEND GIFTED IT TO ME A WHILE BACK AND ONLY A COUPLE MONTHS AGO DID I REALLY GET INTO IT IT'S PRETTY DAMN GREAT IT STARTED AS KIND OF A GIMMICKY JOKE APP BUT OVER TIME IT HAS REALLY EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING PRETTY USEFUL FINDING A GAME WITH RANDOMS CAN BE A BIT LABORIOUS SOMETIMES THE DISCUSSION ON THE GLOBAL CHAT CAN OFTEN BE FULL OF COMPLETE IDIOTS SPOUTING MEMES BUT IN GENERAL THE TOOL ITSELF IS GOOD STUFF

FOR ME AT LEAST IT'S AMAZING TO PLAY GAMES WITH AMERICAN FRIENDS THAT AND THINGS THAT I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO PLAY LOCALLY BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN MY NATIVE LANGUAGE AND SO A LOT OF MY IRL FRIENDS ARE RIGHT OUT OF THE QUESTION THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I COULD SEE IS THE OBVIOUS LEGALITY ISSUES AND THE WHOLE CAN OF WORMS ABOUT WHETHER PUBLISHERS ARE OK WITH IT OR NOT BUT SPEAKING OF ONLINE BOARDGAMES I TRIED AND REVIEWED TABLETOPIA JUST YESTERDAY AND THAT IS OOOO MUCH WORSE THAN TTS IT AIN'T EVEN FUNNY

HOPEFULLY MORE DEVS WILL PUBLISH THEIR STUFF OFFICIALLY ON TTS AT SOME POINT


BEEN MEANING TO GET INTO GAMES AND BUILD A STEAM FRIENDS LIST MY IRL FRIENDS AREN'T EXACTLY GAMING FRIENDLY

GONNA BITE THE BULLET AND BUY THIS BUT I GOT NOBODY TO PLAY IT WITH

MY STEAM NAME IS BURNINGCOUCHES WILL EDIT IF WRONG PLS ADDENDUM
IS THERE SOME PLACE I CAN SEE WHAT GAMES ARE AVAILABLE
MY BROTHER DID ALL THE AUDIO FOR THIS MAKES ME HAPPY WHENEVER IT POPS UP IN MY FEED
I HONESTLY FOUND IT KIND OF USELESS GETTING INTO A PUBLIC GAME WAS BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND NONE OF MY FRIENDS ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING IT THE INTERFACE IS EXTREMELY FUSSY AND EVEN SIMPLE TASKS FELT ANNOYING FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD OFTEN ACCIDENTALLY PICK UP THE ENTIRE DECK OR GROUP OF PIECES INSTEAD OF ONE PIECE AT A TIME THE RULES AREN'T BUILT INTO THE GAMES EITHER SO IT DOESN'T AUTOMATE THE PROCESS OF LEARNING THE GAMES OR ENFORCING THE RULES

I GUESS IT COULD BE GREAT FOR PROTOTYPING OR IF EVERYONE YOU GAME WITH WANTS TO USE IT BUT FOR ME IT JUST DIDN'T WORK

EDIT I SHOULD MENTION THAT EVEN THOUGH I NEVER SEEM TO ACTUALLY PLAY A GAME WITH IT I DON'T REGRET BUYING IT FOR AS I SOMETIMES LIKE TO USE IT TO CHECK OUT THE COMPONENTS OF GAMES I DON'T PERSONALLY OWN
IF YOU BUY IT CAN YOU DOWNLOAD THE IMAGES OF A GAME SO YOU CAN USE THEM AS YOU LIKE NOT ONLY IN THE TABLETOP ITSELF

THANK YOU
STILL NO FIEF
JUST BOUGHT A PACK FOR SOME FRIENDS AND I ANY GOOD RESOURCES FOR LEARNING THE CONTROLS AND HOCKEYS OR ARE THOSE ARE LEARNABLE JUST THROUGH THE GAME
ITS SO GREAT TO EVEN JUST LOOKING THROUGH COMPONENTS OF GAMES YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING JUST SEARCH NAME OF GAME TABLETOP SIMULATOR WORKSHOP AND BE SURPRISED ABOUT HOW SOMEONE HAS MADE A MOD FOR IT
IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH IT

I USE IT MAINLY TO CHECK OUT COMPONENTS OF GAMES AND TRY AND GET A FEEL FOR HOW RULES WORK

I ALSO USE IT TO SOLO PLAY GAMES I OWN BEST ADVANTAGE IS I CAN SETUP AND BE PLAYING A GAME OF ELDRITCH HORROR IN LESS THAN A MINUTE OR PLAY WITH MY FRIEND INTERSTATE
HOW MUCH ARE GAMES TO PLAY ON TTS
LINK
EXCELLENT GAME WITH A TON OF REPLAY VALUE ESPECIALLY GOOD AT GETS LOST IN THE SHUFFLE OF NEWER FLASHIER STUFF NOWADAYS
FINALLY PULLED THE PIN ON THIS AND KINGDOM BUILDER PRICES JUST TO HARD TO RESIST AND W PRIME I WAS ABLE TO GET FREE SAME DAY DELIVERY CRAZY
I LOVE THIS GAME I PICKED IT UP DURING A TARGET WHERE IT NET OUT JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW

THAT BEING SAID IF THIS IS THE ONLY GAME YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUY THIS IS A GOOD PRICE TO JUMP IN ON

ACHY BEAKY HEART
HEXAGONORRHEA
ELVES AND PIXIES ARE FOR CHILDREN

YOU DONT DESERVE IT BECAUSE YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PERSON

THERE IS A NONZERO CHANCE THE GAME WAS CREATED BY CHILD LABOR

YOU COULD DONATE THE MONEY TO YOUR LOCAL HUMANE SOCIETY INSTEAD AO THEY CAN BUY FOOD FOR THE ANIMALS BUT YOU WONT SEE POINT TWO
IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE SPENT ON TWILIGHT STRUGGLE OR NETRUNNER
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO GET INTO THE AMY BUILDING ASPECT ESPECIALLY ID YOU DON'T PLAY OFTEN IF YOU'RE IN EXPERIENCED SOMETIMES THE GAME FEELS LIKE IT ENDS PRETTY FAST BEFORE IT GETS TO THE GOOD BITS THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT THOUGH THE GAME IS PRETTY EXCELLENT
C C ANCIENTS IS MUCH BETTER
IT'S AVAILABLE AS AN APP FOR SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CAN PLAY WHENEVER YOU WANT AND DON'T NEED ANYONE ELSE
IT IS A FUN GAME BUT IT COMPETES WITH OTHER BETTER 2 PLAYER GAMES REBELLION WAR OF THE RING TWILIGHT STRUGGLE
WAIT BATTLEDORE IS ON SALE OPENS NEW BROWSER WINDOW
I'M NO HELP I THINK THE GAME IS GREAT FUN FOR TWO PLAYERS
DID YOU ALREADY PAY FOR SHIPPING ON THE PLEDGE MANAGER AND THEN AFTER ADDING MORE EXPANSIONS ARE REQUESTED TO PAY ADDITIONAL SHIPPING

I SEEM TO REMEMBER READING THAT ANYTHING AFTER THE DEADLINE WOULD SHIP FROM THE US CAUSING ADDITIONAL COSTS OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY
I KNOW SOME DETAILS ABOUT THIS TITLE IT'S HONESTLY THE MOST EXCITED I'VE BEEN ABOUT A HOVERCRAFT TITLE IT SOUNDS AMAZING
MY FAVORITE HOVERCRAFT STORY
AELLO AND WORKING TOGETHER ON


WELL CONSIDER ME INTERESTED
I'M JUST EXCITED TO AELLO WHO DO AMAZING PRODUCTIONS DOING HEAVIER GAMES
OOOO MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS IS MY FAVORITE HOVERCRAFT STORY AND ROB DAVIDA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DESIGNERS SO I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS ONE
YES
ONE OF MY FAMILY FAVORITES IS THE REALLY NASTY HORSE RACING GAME IT HAS THE LOOK AND FEEL OF A CLASSIC GAME AND THEREFORE EASY TO INTRODUCE TO THE OLDER GENERATION BUT THE PLAY CAN BE VERY AMUSING INVOLVING BETTING AND SOME TAKE THAT IT IS THE ONLY ROLL MOVE GAME IN MY COLLECTION IT PLAYS BEST WITH MORE PLAYERS SO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE SUITABLE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THE TWO OF THEM CAN PLAY BY THEMSELVES WERE YOU THINKING GAMES

PERHAPS ALSO CONSIDER THESE GAMES WITH APPROACHABLE THEMES AND STRAIGHTFORWARD RULES

COTTAGE GARDEN TERRIS GAME TO CREATE A GARDEN

DREAM HOME SET COLLECTION GAME

SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS GET YOUR MEEDLESS OFF THE ISLAND BEFORE IT SINKS

TIMELINE QUICK CARD GAME THAT TESTS YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORICAL DATES

SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SCHOUTEN TOTTEN WOULD BE RIGHT UP THEIR ALLEY
IF YOU THINK THEY'D LIKE SOMETHING LIKE A SIMPLER VERSION OF CHESS CHECK OUT MOUSE GUARD SWORDS STRONGHOLDS

IF YOU THINK THEY'D LIKE A SIMPLE BUT DIFFICULT CARD GAME THE GAME IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD IN MY OPINION DESPITE THE HORRENDOUS NAME

IF YOU THINK THEY COULD CO-OPERATE AND HAVE MEMORY BEYOND BAKER STREET GETS MY RECOMMENDATION

JAIPUR AND PATCHWORK ARE MY GAMES SO THEY'RE WORTH A LOOK
PATCHWORK
NO THANKS WOULD BE MY TOP CHOICE IT'S A QUICK CARD GAME WITH EASY RULES QUICK TO PLAY INTERESTING STRATEGY

OTHER SUGGESTIONS

INGENIOUS VISUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING STRATEGICALLY EASY RULES SCALES WELL SHOULD BE GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE ABSTRACT GAMES MINUTES TO PLAY RECOMMEND THE BETTER QUALITY ORIGINAL EDITION

DAYS IN EUROPE USA AFRICA ASIA OR THE AMERICAS BE THE FIRST TO CREATE A COMPLETE TRAVEL ROUTE THERE ARE VERSIONS FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD GREAT GAME THAT PLAYS WELL WITH AND EACH ROUND IS SHORT MINUTES SO YOU CAN PLAY MULTIPLE TIMES IN A ROW IT'S ABOUT DRAWING AND REPLACING CARDS IN A RACK SO THAT YOU HAVE A FULLY CONNECTED TRIP BETWEEN COUNTRIES A LITTLE BIT LIKE RUMMY AND A LOT LIKE AN OLD GAME CALLED

CAN'T STOP FUN FAST GAME

CARTAGENA RACING PIRATES ALONG A PATH BY PLAYING CARDS WITH A CLEVER MOVEMENT MECHANISM

GUILLOTINE FUNNY CARD GAME CHOP OFF ARISTOCRATS HEADS DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION

I'VE HAD LUCK WITH PARTY GAMES LIKE DIXIT AND SPYFAULT WITH MY IN-LAWS WHO KIND OF MATCH THAT DESCRIPTION
A GAME
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I PUT THIS LIST

PAX PORFIRIANA
KEYFLOWER
LEWIS CLARK
ROKOKO
COAL BARON
VILLAGE VILLAGE INN EXP
SNOWDONIA
BRUXELLES
SHAKESPEARE
SEASONS

TRAJAN
SUBURBIA
CHESS IT'S A CLASSIC
MICE AND MYSTICS IS A BIT OF A DUNGEON CRAWL BUT IT'S GOT A NARRATIVE CAMPAIGN THAT YOU PLAY THROUGH IT'S A SOLID GAME THOUGH AND IT'S GOT A FEW EXPANSIONS
MASSIVE DARKNESS GLOOMHAVEN ARCADIA QUEST JUST BECAUSE IT'S GREAT NOT REALLY A TRADITIONAL DUNGEON CRAWLER I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT SHADOW OF BRIMSTONE BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED IT
SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL IS A NICE SIMPLE DUNGEON CRAWLER THAT PRIMARILY USES DEALING WITH EXTREMELY TIGHT SPACES AS A MECHANIC
ANOTHER SUGGESTION WHAT I OPTED FOR YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN IS ANIS
I LIKE BLOOD RAGE MORE THAN I LIKE CRY HAVOC HOWEVER BLOOD RAGE IS TERRIBLE AT 2 AND BEST AT
WE GOT BOTH IN OUR GROUP MY PERSONAL OPINION WOULD BE THAT BLOOD RAGE IS HANDS DOWN BETTER THAN CRY HAVOC DON'T GET ME WRONG CH IS GOOD GAME THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT BR IS A GREAT GAME
I'D SKIP CRY HAVOC THE GAME ISN'T BALANCED THE HUMANS SHOULDN'T LOSE UNLESS EVERYONE PILES ON THEM
BOTH ARE GREAT IN MY OPINION I'VE PLAYED EACH TIMES AND REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH EITHER

BLOOD RAGE IS NEAT IN THAT YOU CAN DO WELL BY HAVING YOUR DUDES DIE GLORIOUS DEATHS

CRY HAVOC IS COOL FOR DIFFERING FACTIONS AND VARYING FACTION ABILITIES STRENGTHS WEAKNESSES ETC

BLOOD RAGE REALLY SHINES WITH PLAYERS WHICH REQUIRES AN EXPANSION THERE'S ALSO FEW NEAT EXPANSIONS THAT ARE DEFINITELY WORTH GETTING BUT MAAAAYBE NOT WORTH THE MONEY I SEE THEM GOING FOR IT'S STILL A FUN GAME WITH AND THOUGH

I THINK CRY HAVOC IS PRETTY MPH AT 2 AS WELL
CLOCKWORK WARS IS ON SALE AT CSI OR WAS YESTERDAY AT LEAST IT HAS A MODULAR BOARD AND SCALES PERFECTLY BETWEEN ALL PLAYER COUNTS THIS IS THE UNDERRATED DUDES ON A MAP GAME THAT SHOULD BE GETTING WAY MORE CREDIT
I'M NOT SURE OF THE EXACT HAUNT BUT I'VE PLAYED MANY GAMES OF BETRAYAL THE DOG HAS NO TRAITS AND THUS CANNOT PICK UP THE KEY IF PICKING UP THE KEY REQUIRES TRAIT ROLLS

HOWEVER AND THIS DEPENDS ON THE HAUNT IF THE KEY ONCE PICKED UP CAN BE TRADED AND OR DROPPED AND PICKED UP FREELY THEN AT THAT POINT THE DOG SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PICK UP THE KEY AND TAKE IT WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO THE DOG CAN NEVER INTERACT WITH THE OBJECT THOUGH HE CAN ONLY GIVE IT TO ANOTHER HERO TO DO THEIR THING

2 THE DRIP TILE CAUSES ONE LESS DIE ON ANY GIVEN TRAIT ROLL MADE IN THE ROOM SINCE THE DOG DOESN'T MAKE TRAIT ROLLS THE DRIP TILE WILL NOT AFFECT THE DOG
SPACE ALERT
THE CAPTAIN IS DEAD
BATTLESTATIONS MAYBE
SPACE DP REF M ATVPDKIKX S IE DTF QID SR REFINEMENTS

IF IT IS SPACE ALERT AMAZON HAS IT ON SALE RIGHT NOW I AM NOT SURE IF IT'S A GOOD PRICE OR NOT BUT HERE IT IS
I LOVE SPACE ALERT
THANKS GUYS MY BOYFRIEND FIGURED IT OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY DAMAGE REPORT BUT SPACE ALERT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD SO I HAVE A LOT TO LOOK INTO NOW
BONANZA
YOUR DRAFTING GAMES LIKE SUSHI GO PARTY WONDERS SEEM GOOD HERE
PARIS CONNECTION COMES REALLY CLOSE TO WHAT YOU'RE AFTER IT'S MORE SUBTLE THAN WHAT SOME PLAYERS GIVE IT CREDIT FOR THOUGH AND IT MAY BE TOO SUBTLE GIVEN YOUR INTERACTION REQUIREMENTS BUT IT'S A NEAT LITTLE GAME IT'S SEEN A LOT OF USAGE IN OUR CIRCLE THIS YEAR WHICH IS A GROUP THAT REALLY LIKES HIGH INTERACTION GAMES THE VARIANT OF RECEIVED STOCK STAYING IN FRONT OF THE SCREEN IMPROVES THE GAME ESPECIALLY FOR NEW PLAYERS
FOR SALE IS GREAT
MAYBE MYSTERIUM IT IS CO-OP BUT IT'S UNLIKE ANY OTHER CO-OP I'VE PLAYED ONE OF YOU IS A GHOST GIVING OUT HINTS TO THE IDENTITY OF YOUR MURDERER USING OVERSIZED PICTURE CARDS A LA DIXIT WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS PLAYING A VASTLY SUPERIOR VERSION OF CLUE AND TRYING TO TRACK DOWN SUSPECTS TAKES ABOUT MINUTES AND PLAYS UP TO SEVEN
KING OF TOKYO S PRETTY EASY TO PICK UP AND THE GAMES ARE SHORT
CODENAMES THE RESISTANCE AVALON
INCAN GOLD IS MEANT TO BE GREAT SPYFAULT IS ALSO FANTASTIC YOU CAN PLAY IT VIA A FREE PHONE APP

ESCAPE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE SEEMS UP YOUR ALLEY EVERY GAME IS MINUTES LONG AND THE RULES ARE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD
COSMIC ENCOUNTER
DEFINITELY DEFINITELY CHECK OUT MISSION RED PLANET PLAYS IN UNDER AN HOUR STRATEGIC LOTS OF FUN AND PLENTY OF SCREWING PEOPLE OVER BUT IN PRETTY FUN WAYS
BETWEEN TWO CITIES PLAYS TAKES LIKE MINUTES REGARDLESS OF NUMBER OF PLAYERS IT'S SEMI CO-OP BUT COMPETITIVE SINCE YOU HAVE A PARTNER TO YOUR LEFT AND ONE TO YOUR RIGHT AS YOU SHARE A CITY WITH BOTH OF THEM

YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO DISCUSS STRATEGIES WITH EACH PARTNER AND IF YOU SEE THEM TRY AND PLAY A BETTER PIECE IN THEIR CITY THEY DON'T SHARE WITH YOU TRY AND CONVINCE THEM TO PUT IT IN YOUR CITY SO INTERACTION CAN BE HIGH
TRURO IS A VERY EASY TO LEARN GAME WITH A SIMPLE DYNAMIC THAT SCALES WELL WITH 2 THROUGH PLAYERS NO TRADING OR ECONOMY MECHANIC BUT DEFINITELY OPTIONS TO SCREW PEOPLE OVER
I CAN'T RECOMMEND THE EXPANDED VERSION TRURO OF THE SEAS AS IT ADDS AN INFURIATING RANDOM ELEMENT
IMPULSE BY CARL CHUDYK
I JUST MADE MY OWN COPY OF CROSSING TODAY TO PLAY WITH MY NEPHEWS AND REALLY ENJOYED IT IT'S DEFINITELY SIMPLISTIC AND IS MORE THAN I FEEL IT'S WORTH BUT YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN VERSION PRETTY EASILY YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF PLAYER INTERACTION AND IT WORKS FOR THAT EXACT PLAYER COUNT PLAYS QUICK ENOUGH THAT THE MOMENTS DON'T LEAVE A BITTER TASTE TOO
BONANZA OR SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM IF YOU WANT NEGOTIATIONS KING OF TOKYO FOR A SIMPLE DICE CHUCKER EVOLUTION FOR A CHINKIER INTERACTIVE PLANNING
GAMES I'VE HAD SUCCESS WITH IN A LUNCH HOUR AT WORK

RED IF YOU DON'T MIND A PURE CARD GAME FAST EASY TO TEACH AND LOTS OF POTENTIAL FOR SINCE EVERY PLAY IS FORCED TO BE ONE OF TAKING VICTORY AWAY FROM THE PREVIOUS PLAYER

EMPIRE LEGENDS I RECOMMEND GETTING THE LEGENDS VERSION BUT THE ORIGINAL IS FINE TOO NICE QUICK GAME WITH A TINY MAP LOTS OF INTERACTION

SMALL WORLD A STEP UP FROM IN COMPLEXITY AND HARDER TO SQUEEZE INTO AN HOUR AT THE HIGHER PLAYER COUNTS BUT LOTS OF FUN AND INTERACTION

BLACK FLEET FOR FUN ON THE HIGH SEAS AS YOU AND YOUR FELLOW PLAYERS EACH CONTROL BOTH A MERCHANT SHIP DOING AND A PIRATE WHO RAIDS YOUR OPPONENTS MERCHANTS WHILE ALSO TAKING TURNS CONTROLLING THE NAVY SHIPS THAT HUNT THE PIRATES DOWN ROUND AND ROUND IT GOES

ROBO RALLY OR JAMAICA OR FORMULA D IF YOU WANT A GOOD RACING GAME
CHICAGO EXPRESS FAIRLY CHAOTIC AT P THOUGH BUT VERY INTERESTING
PARIS CONNECTION VERY QUICK BUT LOTS OF NUANCE
FRESH FISH ONLY UP TO BUT VERY GOOD
KING CHOCOLATE MAYBE A BIT DRY BUT NICE AND SUBTLE
INTRIGUE FILLED BACKSTABBER NEGOTIATIONS
BONANZA TRADES AND DEALMAKING

THEN FOR MORE SOCIAL STYLE GAMES YOU HAVE

COUP
RESISTANCE
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF
COSMIC ENCOUNTER MORE LIKE THOUGH

COLORETTO PLENTY OF INTERACTION BASED ON WHERE YOU PUT THE CARDS GAMES ARE MIN EACH ONLY SCALES TO NOT PLAYERS
LIGHT GAMES FOR THREE TO SIX PLAYERS RATING COMPLEXITY DURATION PRICE

SUSHI GO PARTY MINUTES
TAKE IT EASY MINUTES
TIMELINE HISTORICAL EVENTS MINUTES
SPOT IT MINUTES
CAMEL UP MINUTES
ESCAPE ILLUSIONS MINUTES
THE ADVENTURERS THE PYRAMID OF HORUS MINUTES
TIMELINE CHALLENGE MINUTES
FOR SALE MINUTES
ROLL FOR IT DELUXE EDITION MINUTES
TERRA MINUTES
TRURO MINUTES
MYSTERIUM MINUTES
ULTIMATE WARRIOR MINUTES
PITCHCAR MINUTES
COLT EXPRESS WOULD FIT YOUR CRITERIA WELL
JUST PLAYED PICTOMANIA YESTERDAY WITH CASUALS THE RULES COVER MOST LOOPHOLES AND ENCOURAGES YOU TO DRAW PROPERLY UNLIKE MANY DRAWING GAMES VERY EASY TO LEARN OR TEACH

MADE BY SAME DESIGNER WHO MADE CODENAMES AND SPACE TRUCKERS
THIS IS ONE OF THEIR BEST TOP VIDEOS BECAUSE THEY'RE CLEARLY HAVING A GREAT TIME MAKING IT I'VE WATCHED SO MUCH DICE TOWER CONTENT THAT I KNOW THEIR TASTES AND I COULD HAVE PROBABLY GUESSED HALF THIS LIST SO FOR ME NOW IT'S OFTEN JUST ABOUT LISTENING TO FRIENDLY FACES CHATTING ABOUT GAMES ALTHOUGH ZEE DOES OCCASIONALLY THROW IN AN OBSCURE ONE I HAVEN'T HEARD OF WHICH IS NICE

AS FOR BEING USEFUL I THINK IT IS I WANT TO KNOW WHAT ONE EURO GAME THE GUY WHO DOESN'T LIKE EURO GAMES STILL ENJOYS BECAUSE THAT MUST SAY A LOT ABOUT THAT GAME

AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS THIS IS A USEFUL LIST VIEWERS FAMILIAR WITH THE TASTES OF TOM ZEE AND SAM CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO SEE IF THEY TOO MIGHT LIKE A GAME THAT NORMALLY ISN'T THEIR STYLE THIS COULD BE HELPFUL FOR PLAYING GAMES WITH PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT TASTES THAN YOU AND FINDING A GAME YOU BOTH CAN ENJOY

THIS SUB SEEMS SO NEGATIVE SOMETIMES IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE COOL THING TO DO IS TO INSULT PEOPLE PRODUCING RESOURCES THAT PROBABLY MOST USERS HERE HAVE USED TO AID THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOBBY EAST G WIL WHEATON AND DICE TOWER
THIS VIDEO WAS ONE OF THE MUST FUN VIDEOS THEY HAVE DONE RECENTLY I LOVE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THEM
THIS IS THE REVERSE OF THEIR RECENT LIST ABOUT GAMES THEY THOUGHT THEY'D LIKE BUT DIDN'T THESE ARE GAMES THEY THOUGHT THEY'D DISLIKE BUT ENDED UP LIKING I LIKED BOTH OF THOSE LISTS
I THOUGHT THIS WAS ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING ONES AS YOU GET ALL THE OUTLIERS
BATTLEGROUNDS KEEPS GETTING CRAPPED ON BY MINIATURES HOBBYISTS FOR NOT HAVING MINIATURES

THAT SEEMS COMPLETELY BACKWARD TO ME

I DON'T DO MINIS ANYMORE BECAUSE I HAVE KIDS AND NO TIME SPACE TO DO IT BUT I WILL PROBABLY GET BACK INTO IT AFTER A WHILE BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE IT I LIKE PLANNING THE MODELS ARMY WHATEVER SHOPPING FOR THEM BUILDING THEM CUSTOMIZING THEM PAINTING THEM PLAYING WITH THEM LEARNING NEW TECHNIQUES SO WHEN YOU HAVE A GAME THAT IS EXCELLENT MAYBE BETTER EVEN THAN GAMES WORKSHOP GAMES BUT DOESN'T REQUIRE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN MINIS YOU'RE UPSET IT SEEMS LIKE A DREAM SCENARIO TO ME YOU GET TO MAKE YOUR ENTIRE ARMY FROM SCRATCH

NOTHING IN BATTLEGROUNDS SAYS YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH MINIATURES GO TO THEIR FORUM AND YOU'LL FIND PEOPLE DOING THIS REGULARLY THERE'S PLENTY OF MINIATURES GAMES WHEREIN YOUR SQUADS ARE ON LITTLE TRAYS THIS IS THE SAME THING EXCEPT IT DOESN'T COST YOU AND WEEKS OF WORK TO TRY OUT A NEW STRATEGY IT WON'T RELEGATE YOU TO PLAYING WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR AREA THAT HAPPEN TO BE AT THE INTERSECTION OF INSANE EXPENDABLE INCOME FREE TIME

PEOPLE PLAY WITH UNPAINTED MINIATURES ALL THE TIME THERE'S PEOPLE WHO WON'T PLAY WITH THEIR BEST PAINTED MINIS SO IF THE ONLY THING THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO DO IS PAINT BECAUSE YOU WON'T SHOP AND MODEL FOR YOURSELF THEN HOW CAN YOU ACCEPT A GAME THAT PEOPLE PLAY UNPAINTED BUT WON'T ACCEPT A GAME THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE MINIS IT DOESN'T MAKE A LICK OF SENSE YOU SHOULD BE HAPPIER IT DOESN'T COME WITH MODELS IF THE MODELLING IS YOUR HOBBY

IT'S AN EXCELLENT GAME AND I'M STOKED IT'S GETTING REBOOTED I HOPE THE ART IS BETTER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY TURNED OFF BY NOT THIS NO MINIS NONSENSE IF FFA PUT IT OUT WITH BADASS ARTWORK AND LOTS OF MARKETING HYPE PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT THE DAWN OF A NEW AGE OF ACCESSIBLE TABLETOP WARGAMES
DELETED
IS TOM MENTALLY HANDICAPPED BECAUSE HE HAS THE TEMPERAMENT AND OPINIONS OF A YEAR OLD AS A NECKBEARD

NO ONE POSTED THE LIST GODDAMNIT
THE APP IS EXCELLENT BUT IT'S TOUGH TO BEAT A TACTILE BOARD GAME GET THE APP TO TRY IT OUT
THE APP IS THE BEST DIGITAL VERSION OF A BOARD GAME YOU'LL EVER PLAY IT'S AMAZING THE CREATORS OF THIS PORT DESERVE APPLAUSE

THE BOARD GAME IS OF COURSE STILL BETTER JUST BECAUSE IT ALWAYS IS
I HAVE IOS VERSION AND IT'S REALLY GOOD BUT I ALWAYS PREFER TO PLAY ON THE REAL DESKTOP
THE APP IS EXCELLENT BUT IT DOES REDUCE IT TO FEELING VERY MUCH LIKE A SOLO EFFORT I WOULDN'T USE IT FOR A GROUP IF IT'S JUST YOU THEN YES WELL WORTH IT
IT'S ADDRESSED IN THE FAQ

VIII ENDGAME SPECIAL CASES
DURING A DEFEAT AGAINST THE PICTS OR SAXONS WHERE A SIEGE ENGINE IS LAID
SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A SWORD OF WHICH A MAJORITY ARE WHITE IS THE GAME WON
BECAUSE OF THE MAJORITY OF WHITE SWORDS OR LOST BECAUSE OF THE SIEGE ENGINES

IN THIS CASE THE GAME IS LOST IT IS LOST THE INSTANT A SIEGE ENGINE IS LAID AROUND CAMELOT
BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A CHANCE FOR THE KNIGHTS TO COUNT THE WHITE SWORDS
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING DEFINITIVE IN THE RULES TO COVER THIS BUT MY INTERPRETATION WOULD BE THAT UNLESS SOMETHING EXPLICITLY SAYS THAT THE QUEST RESULTS ARE RESOLVED IN ORDER THEY ALL HAPPEN AT ONCE THUS THE GAME IS OVER AND YOU WON ON ONE FRONT AND LOST ON ANOTHER SO YOU LOSE SINCE THE TIE GOES AGAINST THE KNIGHTS
YOU CHECK THE SWORDS AFTER COMPLETING THE ACTION WHICH WOULD INCLUDE RESOLVING THE EFFECTS OF FAILING THE QUEST I'D SAY YOU LOSE DUE TO SIEGE ENGINES BEFORE YOU WIN DUE TO SWORDS
BOOZE
PLAYING STRIPTHEBES INSTEAD OF JUST THEBES
WE ALWAYS USE BACKGROUND MUSIC
READING THAT PANDEMIC VARIANT JUST STRESSES ME OUT

UNDERNAME CHECKS OUT FOR THIS TYPE OF POST AND REPLY COMMENTS
I THINK YOU ANSWERED YOUR OWN QUESTION THE RANDOMIZATION MAKES IT MORE CHALLENGING TO SPOT MOVES IMMEDIATELY I'VE ONLY PLAYED IT ONCE MYSELF BUT RECALL BOTH SIDES KICKING THEMSELVES FOR MISSING ONE MOVE OR ANOTHER THAT WAS HALF THE FUN
I WOULD SAY FLASH POINT

YOU'RE A GROUP OF FIREFIGHTERS TRYING TO SAVE A BUILDING FROM BURNING DOWN YOUR GROUP DOESN'T SEEM NERVOUS TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL PANDEMIC A GREAT OPTION OPTION AS WELL BUT I FIND THERE IS LESS QUARTERBACKING IN FLASH POINT THAT MAY BE DUE TO THE MYSTERY WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A PERSON IN A ROOM OR IF FIRE WILL SPREAD AND SO ON

IN CONTRAST PANDEMIC IS A CLASSIC AND CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING IT ALSO OPENS THE DOOR TO PANDEMIC LEGACY WHICH SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOUR GROUP MAY HAVE AN ITCH FOR IT A VERY HIGH STAKES ROUND PLAY THROUGH OF PANDEMIC BASICALLY IF YOU LOSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY THAT PARTICULAR BOARD AGAIN

BEST OF LUCK HOPE THAT HELPS

GOOD ON YOU GUYS FOR GETTING SO MUCH PLAY OUT OF A SMALL COLLECTION

PANDEMIC IS THE DEFINITIVE CO-OP IT'S BEEN HUGELY INFLUENTIAL AND WILL HAVE BEEN AN INSPIRATION FOR TONS OF SUGGESTIONS YOU'LL GET HERE OH AND IF ANYONE SAYS GET PANDEMIC LEGACY FIRST DON'T BUT MAYBE GET IT SECOND I FIND THAT THE BASE GAME AND EXPANSIONS ARE VERY DEEP AND IT CAN BE EASY TO GET CAUGHT IN THE HYPE THAT THE NEWER FLASHIER CAMPAIGN IS BETTER WHEN IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE

MYSTERIUM IS A MODERN CLASSIC TOO IT HAS A GHOST WHO CAN ONLY TALK THROUGH SURREAL ART AND EVERYONE'S WORKING TOGETHER TO FIND OUT WHO KILLED THEM
POWERGRID
SEMI COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE PLAYERS ARE AGAINST EACH OTHER UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER SO THEY ALL DON'T LOOSE THE GAME EVERY PLAYER IS CEO OF AN ENERGY COMPANY THAT NEEDS TO ADD GREEN PLANTS AND STOP POLLUTION BY REDUCING FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO PROPOSE PROJECT INSTALL PROJECT AND CONSTRUCT POWER PLANT WHILE IN THE PROCESS OTHER PLAYERS CAN CONTINUE WHERE YOU STOPPED UNTIL POWER PLANT IS CONSTRUCTED WHICH MEANS YOU CAN PREPARE EVERYTHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE EVEN THAT IS NOT YOUR INTENTION UP TO PLAYERS
ROBINSON CRUSOE ADVENTURES ON THE CURSED ISLAND HIGHLY THEMATIC AND HARD GAME UP TO PLAYERS
SAMURAI SPIRIT THIS SHOULD ACCOMMODATE UP TO PLAYERS
ELDRITCH HORROR FORSAKEN LORE EXPANSION I THINK THIS GOES UP TO PLAYERS
PANDEMIC IS THE CLASSIC CO-OP GAME BUT ONLY PLAYS UP TO

I WOULD RECOMMEND EITHER FLASH POINT OR HANAFI BASED ON THE GAMES YOU'VE PLAYED
MM I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND DEAD OF WINTER IT'S NOT A GAME YOU CAN CONTINUOUSLY KEEP PLAYING BUT IT ADDS A NICE DEPTH BETWEEN THOSE SUPER LONG HOUR GAMES AND THE HOUR GAMES A GROUP OF SURVIVORS ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE FROM A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE AND NEEDS TO WORK TOGETHER TO COMPLETE THE MAIN OBJECTIVE BUT BE WARY OF A POSSIBLE TRAITOR IN YOUR MIDSTS THOUGH IF I RECALL DOW IS A PLAYER GAME

I'D ALSO SUGGEST CARCASSONNE WHICH IS A GREAT GAME WITH A LOT OF REPLAY VALUE YOU ARE BUILDING THE BOARD AND TRYING TO SCORE THE AMOUNT OF POINTS BUT BE CAREFUL AS YOUR FRIENDS WILL ALSO TRY TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN PATHS AND MAYBE HINDER YOU AS WELL NOT A CO-OP GAME

PANDEMIC ITSELF IS ONLY A PLAYER GAME SO IT IS NOT IDEAL UNLESS YOU REALLY ONLY HAVE PLAYERS

ELDRITCH HORROR IS A GREAT GAME BUT SETTING UP IS AN EXTREME PAIN CONSIDER MINUTES AND IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE NOT LOOKING INTO HOUR GAMES THIS IS NOT YOUR CUP OF TEA


MAYBE AN AREA CONTROL GAME IS A GOOD NEXT CHOICE EMET OR CYCLADES
EUROPE
WHAT IS THE BEST VERSION OF TICKET TO RIDE

OH IS THAT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TODAY WE'RE GONNA FIGHT

TR EUROPE

YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH TRAIN STATIONS FERRIES AND TUNNELS WHEN TEACHING NEW PLAYERS AND THERE IS A LOT MORE ROOM TO GROW THAN WITH VANILLA TR

IT'S ALSO CHEAPER WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE COST OF THE EXPANSION WHICH IS NECESSARY WITH THE BASE GAME

I WOULD SUGGEST THE ORIGINAL WITH FOR THE BETTER CARDS OR EUROPE I HAVE HEARD NORDIC IS BEST OF PLAYING WITH ONLY TWO
MY FAMILY HAS ALMOST EVERY VERSION OF TICKET TO RIDE AND WE MOSTLY PLAY EUROPE AND INDIA SWITZERLAND
TICKET TO RIDE MÄRKLIN BY A GOOD BIT
ORIGINAL BOARD WITH IS ALWAYS FUN I USUALLY DEFAULT TO THIS IF I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING THAT HAS A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF SETUP BUT IS STILL A THINKING GAME

FOR OR LESS INDIA IS A LOT OF FUN YOU GET ROUTES THAT AREN'T OBVIOUS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE ANYTHING IS

UK IS INTERESTING WHERE THEY ADD A TECH TREE AND VISAS I HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY THE PENNSYLVANIA BOARD YET BUT THE STOCKS SEEM INTERESTING
UM HANDS DOWN UK PENNSYLVANIA ADDS ENOUGH COMPLEXITY TO THE BASE GAME TO KEEP IT INTERESTING BUT NOT TOO MUCH GIVES YOU THE OPTION OF BOTH BOARDS IN A SINGLE EXPANSION EACH WITH A DIFFERENT FLAVOR DEPENDING ON YOUR GROUP

EUROPE IS A CLOSE SECOND WITH SWITZERLAND AND NORDIC COMING IN BEHIND
FOR 2 SWITZERLAND IS JUST A TERRIFIC 2 PLAYER GAME IT GETS OLD ONCE YOU'VE PLAYED IT TIMES BUT BY THEN YOU'VE PLAYED IT TIMES

MARILIN IS MY FAVORITE FOR MULTIPLE PLAYERS THE MAP IS TIGHT AND MEAN AND THE PASSENGERS PROVIDE A REALLY INTERESTING THING TO FIGHT OVER
VANILLA
IN MY EXPERIENCE I THINK BEST PURPOSE IS TO INTRODUCE GAMING TO PEOPLE AND IN THAT REGARD I BELIEVE THE BEST VERSION IS THE BASE WITH IT HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF RULES AND THE MOST FAMILIAR MAP AT LEAST TO AMERICANS PEOPLE WILL SAY HOW THERE'S SOME IMBALANCE TO THE MAP OR WHATEVER BUT IF YOU ARE PLAYING WITH NEW PLAYERS THAT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT MATTERS IS HAVING A FUN EXPERIENCE WITH A GAME THAT IS EASY TO LEARN AND NICE TO LOOK AT

I ALSO HAVE HIGH OPINIONS OF NORDIC COUNTRIES THIS IS A VERY CHALLENGING MAP AND IS THE HARDEST OF THE SERIES IT ONLY PLAYS FROM BUT IT IS VERY EXCITING AND TENSE THIS IS GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO THE TR SERIES AND WANT TO TEST THEIR SKILLS

SO THAT'S MY PICK FOR THE TWO I ENJOYED THE MOST ORIGINAL TR IS THERE FOR GRABBING NEW PLAYERS INTO THE HOBBY AND SHOWING THEM A GOOD TIME NORDIC IS MY PREFERRED WAY TO PLAY BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST AND COMPETITIVE

WITH THAT SAID MY GAME FOR NEW PLAYERS IS STILL SPLENDOR AND AS FAR AS PLAYING WITH OTHER GAMERS GO IT DEPENDS ON THE PEOPLE
VITICULTURE SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU IT'S FROM STEGMAIER GAMES JUST LIKE SCYTHE IT HAS A SIMILAR VIBE AND ART DESIGN YET BEEFING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME AT THE SAME TIME IT'S A WORKER PLACEMENT EURO WHERE YOU MAKE WINE IN YOUR OWN WINERY JUST BE SURE TO GET THE ESSENTIAL EDITION
SHAKESPEARE THEMATICALLY EVERY PLAYER RUNS A THEATER HIRES ACTORS DO REHEARSALS AND TRIES TO MAKE BEST SHOW
MECHANICALLY THERE IS BLIND BIDDING WHICH DETERMINES NUMBER OF ACTIONS FOR TURN AS WELL AS PLAYERS ORDER LOW SCORES NEED TO PAY ACTORS AT THE END OR LOOSE POINTS USE CHARACTERS ON ONE TURN BUT REST ON OTHER MAKE DRESSES OR BUILD SET ETC
REALLY GOOD GAME
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO A CLASSIC GAME OF MINE HANSA TEUTONIA I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED IF NOT FOR THE DRY AS DRAB THEME I WOULD HAVE LESS ISSUES LETTING IT MAKE IT TO THE TABLE MY FRIENDS PREFERS A LITTLE THEME
KEYFLOWER JUST GET KEYFLOWER
IF YOU LIKE ELABORATE DESIGNS AND DEEP EURO GAMEPLAY TRY THE ALLERGIST OR LISBOA
GAMES DON'T NECESSARY NEED TO BE COMPLICATED OR HEAVY TO HAVE FUN THE MOST GAMES YOU MENTION ALMOST ALL ARE NOT THAT CASUAL AND A LOT OF WORKER PLACEMENTS I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING SOME MORE CASUAL GAMES TO HAVE FUN WITH AND YOU'LL GET MORE GAMES TO THE TABLE AS WELL SUGGESTIONS

CODESNAMES
TICKET TO RIDE
SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS
MYSTERIUM
GALAXY TRUCKER
TALES OF ARABIAN NIGHTS
DIXIT
FORBIDDEN DESERT
SUSHI GO
MACHI BORO
EMET JUST BECAUSE IT'S THAT GOOD AND YOU DON'T HAVE DIRECT CONFLICT WAR GAMES
HOLY SHIT RED PLANET MARKED DOWN FROM TO GUYS THIS IS THE DEAL WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

STOP POSTING YOUR SHITTY AFFILIATE LINKS EVERYWHERE

I PLAYED MOMBASA THE OTHER DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT IMMEDIATELY BECAME A TOP GAME FOR ME WAS ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED WITH IT THAT MAKES ME EVEN MORE EXCITED FOR THIS ONE WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING SHIPPED TO ME IF THIS GAME TURNS OUT TO BE SOMETHING I LOVE LIKE MOMBASA HE'S GOING TO BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE DESIGNERS
GREAT REVIEW THE DEPTH IN THIS GAME IS WHAT DREW ME TO IT AFTER WATCHING A PLAYTHROUGH DELIVERING COWS TO KANSAS SEEMS LIKE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BUT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY DIRECTLY SCORE ANY POINTS FOR DOING IT I'LL BE PLAYING MY SECOND GAME TOMORROW NIGHT I REALLY CAN'T WAIT TO DIVE IN AGAIN
I HOPE THE GAME WOULD BE PRODUCED IN ANOTHER STYLE OF ARTWORK
I JUST PICKED UP A COPY FOR US YESTERDAY BUT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN A PLAY IN PERHAPS THIS WEEKEND IT DEFINITELY LOOKS INTERESTING
WHAT VERSION OF MOMBASA IS THAT SOME SORT OF SPECIAL EDITION
DECENT ENOUGH GAME BUT AFTER GAMES ALL TOOK WELL OVER HOURS EACH NOT EVEN INCLUDING TEACHING TIME I DECIDED IT WAS JUST TOO LONG A GAME FOR ME
LOST ME AT YOU SCORE POINTS SICK OF COUNTING APS ON A PAD IT'S NOT HARD TO DO SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING THIS IS JUST LAZY
THE BIGGING NEWS FOR ME IS THAT RICKY ROYAL OF BOX OF DELIGHTS DESIGNED A CYBERPUNK HACKER GAME

TINY EPIC GALAXIES BEYOND THE BLACK

IN THE YEAR OF THE DRAGON 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION
THEY'RE MAKING A WAREHOUSE BOARD GAME NOW HOW LONG HAS THE SHOW BEEN OFF THE AIR IF IT STILL HAD A HUGE FOLLOWING LIKE FIREFLY DOES I COULD UNDERSTAND BUT IT DOESN'T AT LEAST NOT THAT I KNOW OF
I DESPISE THAT LAYOUT
FIELDS OF DESPAIR IS ON HERE HURRAY
AGRICOLA BIG BOX WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE TOP OF MY LIST SHAME IT IS GETTING PUSHED BACK
THE 7TH CONTINENT SEEMS INTERESTING

NO AGRICOLA
RACE ROLL FOR THE GALAXY SHOULD BE GETTING SOME NEW EXPANSIONS EACH PLUS JUMP DRIVE AND A FTG BOARD GAME

EDIT SPOOLING
I MAY GET A LOT OF FLACK FOR THIS BUT AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS THAT MOST ANTICIPATED X IN ANY FORM OF AWARDS IS KIND OF SILLY
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIDE THE TUBESTEAK GENERALLY PLAYED WITH 2 BUT SOMETIMES EXPANDED TO WITH OPEN-MINDED GAMERS TURNS INTO A LEGACY TITLE IF YOU DON'T TAKE APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS
AND THEN WE HELD HANDS

SWORDS

JAIPUR

ASCENSION APPRENTICE EDITION

PATCHWORK

ONE ZERO ONE

MOUSE GUARD SWORDS AND STRONGHOLDS

PANDEMIC THE CURE PUT IT ALL IN THE DRAW BAG

HIVE POCKET
I HAVE THREE SUGGESTIONS

LOVE LETTER HOW CAN I NOT RECOMMEND THIS ON A HONEYMOON EXTREMELY PORTABLE ESPECIALLY THE VERSION THAT YOU ONLY NEED A POUCH BAG FOR IT'S A BLUFFING AND DEDUCTION GAME QUICK ROUNDS LOTS OF FUN

SCHOUTEN TOTTEN EXTREMELY PORTABLE TWO PLAYER GAME FEELS A LOT LIKE PLAYING GAMES OF POKER AND THEREFORE ALSO HAS BLUFFING INVOLVED

LOST CITIES ALSO PORTABLE BUT HAS THE LEAST PORTABLE BOX OF THESE THREE GREAT REINER KNIAZI GAME FEELS LIKE RUMMY OR POKER

HAVE A GREAT HONEYMOON AND CONGRATS
HIVE POCKET
I KEEP GETTING LICK FOOT I THINK THESE DICE ARE BROKEN
SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE MIGHT BE GOOD IF YOU ARE DRIVING I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO FIND GOOD GAMES FOR COUPLES FOR ROAD TRIPS AND THIS ONE SEEMED TO COME OUT ON TOP SINCE ONE PERSON CAN STILL PLAY EVEN WHILE DRIVING IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SMALL THOUGH ALSO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THIS YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO CHECK OUT MYTHOS TALES WHICH COPIES THE FORMAT BUT CHANGES THE THEME AND I'VE HEARD IS BETTER

I CAN ALSO RECOMMEND PAPERBACK AS A MIX BETWEEN DECKBUILDING AND SCRABBLE TWO THINGS THAT MY OWN WIFE HAPPENS TO LIKE IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF CARDS SO THE BOX IS PRETTY SMALL

LASTLY YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT ANY OF THE TINY EPIC SERIES OF GAMES WHOSE WHOLE CLAIM TO FAME ARE SMALL BOX SIZES
GET AND THEN WE HELD HANDS AND THANK ME LATER IT'S THE PERFECT 2 PLAYER GAME FOR COUPLES MY FIANCE AND I LOVE IT
THE RAVENS OF HRI SAHASHRI

REALLY SMALL BOX SO ITS SUPER PORTABLE DOWNSIDE IS THEY ARE TAROT SIZED CARDS SO REQUIRE A GOOD BIT OF ROOM WHEN ACTUALLY PLAYING
MY HUSBAND AND I BROUGHT DUTCH BLITZ AND RACE FOR THE GALAXY CARDS ONLY KEPT TRACK OF VP ON PAPER WE ALSO BROUGHT LORDS OF WATERDEEP BUT THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE WE HAD ROOM IN THE SUITCASE
FAIRYTALE CONGRATS BUT DO YOU NEED TO TAKE ANY

EDIT THIS IS A DRAFTING GAME THAT IS SUPER SMALL AND WORKS WELL WITH 2 PEOPLE
WIFE AND I PLAYED THIS AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES ON OUR HONEYMOON
MY WIFE AND I ARE AVID AND HAVE RAN INTO THIS SAME SCENARIO WHILE THE FOLLOWING ARE NOT BOARD GAMES THEY ARE FUN EITHER WAY

CRIBBAGE CLASSIC CARD GAME WITH A SMALL USUALLY WOOD BOARD FOR KEEPING SCORE

PHASE EASY WORKS FAIRLY WELL WITH 2 FUN TO ADD NEW FRIENDS TO THE GAME

CHECKERS WE HAVE A BANDANA THAT DOUBLES AS A BOARD THAN WE JUST USE RANDOM OBJECTS AS THE PIECES

FLUX A FUN CARD GAME ALWAYS DIFFERENT EASY TO PLAY WITH 2

I KNOW THESE AREN'T WHAT YOU WERE INTENDING BUT I HOPE THEY HELP WHERE ARE YOU GOING ON YOUR HONEYMOON
FOR PATCHWORK
PATCHWORK LEVELLY GAME GRAB A COUPLE OF PACKS OF BUTTONS FROM AMAZON FOR A COUPLE OF TO REPLACE THE CARDBOARD ONES

WONDERS DUEL WE BOTH LOVE PLAYING THIS QUICK DEEP

OH MY GOODS TINY BOX BIG GAME

JAIPUR POSSIBLY STILL THE BEST 2 PLAYER GAME WE OWN

GLOOM IF YOU LIKE STORY TELLING

MR JACK POCKET

U GETINFO
LOOK FOR THE TINY EPIC SERIES SPECIALLY GALAXIES PATCHWORK OH MY GOODS GAME OF TRAINS LOVE LETTER
HIVE POCKET
ONITAMA THE BOX IS UNFORTUNATELY BIGGER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE BUT IT'S PORTABLE AND GREAT FUN
GOING TO MENTION RED AS I DON'T THINK ANYONE ELSE HAS YET

I'LL SECOND FLUX TOO PICK THE VARIANT FLAVOUR EDITION THAT APPEALS TO YOU MOST
VITICULTURE IS AN EXCELLENT NEXT STEP WORKER PLACEMENT GAME

NAVEGADOR WAS JUST REPRINTED AND IS AN EXCELLENT INTERACTIVE ECONOMIC EURO GAME FOR PLAYERS FEATURING THE SAME MECHANICS AND HIGHLY INTERACTIVE AS WELL IS ANTIAE II FROM THE SAME DESIGNER IT'S A EURO CIV GAME FOR PLAYERS

ROCOCO IS A GREAT HAND BUILDING AREA CONTROL GAME FOR PLAYERS SOME PEOPLE GET HUNG UP ON THE THE DRESS MAKING THEME BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE MISSING OUT AN A VERY ELEGANT ENGAGING GAME


ANY OTHER FAVORITES SO FAR ELDRITCH AND LORDS OF WATERDEEP ARE QUITE DIFFERENT SO ANY OTHER INFO MIGHT HELP NARROW SOMETHING DOWN
AGGRESSIVE
CO-OP
THEMES MATTER
LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS MUCH BETTER WITH SCOUNDRELS OF SKULLPORT EXPANSION NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE OR NOT
ROLL OR RACE FOR THE GALAXY ARE BOTH GREAT ROLL IS EASIER TO LEARN AND ALWAYS FUN TO ROLL A BUNCH OF DICE BUT RACE HAS MORE DEPTH

BLOOD RAGE IS VERY GOOD DEPENDS IF YOUR GROUP LIKES AREA CONTROL AND CONFLICT IN A GAME

SOME OTHER SUGGESTIONS TO LOOK INTO FOR A LITTLE HEAVIER GAMES THAN THE ONES YOU'VE MENTIONED CONCORDIA PUERTO RICO EL GRANDE EMET CAELUS
KEYFLOWER
ISTANBUL
SNOWDONIA
CONCORDIA
DO YOU MIND SERIOUS ECONOMIC GAMES OR DO YOU WANT STUFF WITH COMBAT AND PRETTY ART
I REALLY REALLY REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD GET CONCORDIA PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE HIDEOUS BOX ART THE GAME ITSELF IS BEAUTIFUL
IF YOU GO TO BOARDGAMEGEEK YOU CAN FILTER BY PLAYERS RATING AND WEIGHT MAYBE DO THIS HAVE A LOOK AROUND AND THEN COME BACK WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS
KINGDOM DEATH KICKICJSTARER IF YOU DON MIND SUMMER DELIVERY
INTERESTING QUESTION BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO CLEAN UP SOME OF YOUR TERMINOLOGY SCYTHE ISN'T WORKER PLACEMENT AT PLACEMENT GAMES FEATURE ACTION DRAFTING WHERE AVAILABLE ACTIONS ARE BLOCKED OFF BY PLAYERS AS THEY'RE CHOSEN CALLING VITICULTURE IS ALSO A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS BECAUSE IT IS INDEED A COMPETITIVE GAME YOU MAY BE SAYING IT'S NOT AS TIGHT AS A GAME LIKE AGRICOLA BUT COMPETITION FOR SPOTS IN A GAME CAN STILL BE PRETTY INTENSE

YOU MIGHT GET BETTER RESPONSES IF YOU ASKED WHETHER PEOPLE PREFERRED TIGHT WORKER PLACEMENT RESOURCE SPACES ARE SCARCE AND HIGHLY CONTESTED WHILE GAMES LIKE FIELDS OF ARLE AND A FEAST FOR ODIN HAVE A RIDICULOUS NUMBER OF AVAILABLE ACTION SPACES LESSENING HE CONFLICT OVER KEY ACTIONS

AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION I THINK AGRICOLA AND LE HAVRE BOTH DO TIGHT WORKER PLACEMENT VERY WELL THERE ARE A TON OF ACTIONS IN LE HAVRE BUT A KEY FEW GET FOUGHT OVER QUITE OFTEN A FEAST FOR ODIN IS MY FAVORITE WORKER PLACEMENT GAME DUE TO HOW OPEN IT IS THE SOLO GAME FEELS QUITE SIMILAR TO THE MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S GREAT ALONE OR WITH OTHERS
TIGHT COMPETITIVE THAT'S MY STYLE I LIKE THE TYPE OF WP GAME THAT FEELS LIKE MUSICAL CHAIRS ALWAYS HAVING FEWER AVAILABLE ACTIONS OR RESOURCES THAN EVERYONE WANTS
AT THE ONSET OF LEARNING A GAME IF IT'S LOOSE WORKER PLACEMENT I ALWAYS THINK JEEZ THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE VERY FUN

BUT THEN I GET SURPRISED AND REALLY LIKE IT CASE IN POINT VITICULTURE

I GUESS IN MY MIND I'M WORRIED THAT THE GAME WILL BE TOO EASY IF OTHER PLAYERS AREN'T BLOCKING YOU BUT THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF METHODS THE DESIGNERS USE TO MAKE GAMES HARD
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT YOU'RE PLAYING A FEAST FOR ODIN WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET HIGH SCORES NOT TO WIN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION
I WANNA SAY YOU START WITH EACH BUT IT'S BEEN A WHILE COULD BE
AND PER TURN IS DETERMINED BY POSITION ON THE SCORE CHART I THINK
THAT GUY GOT BANNED FROM CWO FOR TRYING TO PROFIT FROM THE IP AND COPYRIGHT OF NOT JUST MECHWARRIOR ONLINE BUT TOPPS AS WELL THERE IS SO MUCH WRONG WITH SELLING WHAT HE'S DONE SO MUCH LEGAL TROUBLE HE'D BE IN FOR IF THE LAWYERS DECIDE HE'S WORTH THEIR TIME
I REALLY THINK THIS GAME SUCKS ABOUT A MILLION OTHER MIDWEIGHT EUROS I'D RATHER PLAY

I'M APPARENTLY IN THE MINORITY THERE THOUGH
FANTASTIC GAME I REALLY LIKE IT
I PUT IN ORDER IN FOR THIS GAME FOR BUCKS SO YEAH
IT'S WORTH IT IN MY OPINION

THE DELUXE VERSION ISN'T A NEW VERSION IT WAS THE KICKSTARTER VERSION THAT HAD SOME UPGRADED COMPONENTS THE LAST OF THOSE WERE SOLD OFF AT GENION AND BMG HAS SAID THEY WON'T BE
YOU LUCKY SON OF A I REALLY WISH I COULD GET ORLEANS FOR THAT PRICE REALLY GREAT GAME WILL PROBABLY END UP DISHING OUT
MY FAVOURITE GAME HAS BEEN DIAMONDS IT'S EXACTLY LIKE A TRADITIONAL GAME BUT THROWING OFF LEAD SUIT BENEFITS YOU I ALSO LIKE CHRONICLE IT'S A NICE CHANGE HAVING CARD ABILITIES THAT AFFECT THE PLAY
ANOTHER VOTE FOR DIAMONDS IT'S BEEN A HUGE HIT WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS YOU ALWAYS GET SOMETHING EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BEST CARDS AND NOT WINNING TRICKS CAN BE A VIABLE STRATEGY
HAVE A LOOK AT WIZARD IT'S A COMMERCIAL VARIANT OF OH HELL WHICH IS ALSO A GOOD TRICK TAKING GAME WITH A STANDARD DECK

IT INCLUDES TWO RANKS THAT ARE UNIQUE THE FIRST WIZARD PLAYED ALWAYS WINS AND THE FIRST JESTER PLAYED ALWAYS LOSES

WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO LOSE A TRICK BECAUSE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH HAND YOU HAVE TO BID ON HOW MANY TRICKS YOU'LL TAKE WIZARDS AND JESTERS GIVE YOU MORE WAYS TO TAKE OR GIVE UP THE LEAD

WE'VE PLAYED THIS FOR YEARS IT'S THE ONLY GAME I OWN THAT I'VE REBOUGHT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO WORN TO PLAY IT'S EASY TO TEACH AND IS ALWAYS A HIT WITH GROUPS WE'VE INTRODUCED IT TO
I GREW UP PLAYING TRICK TAKING GAMES MOSTLY EUCHRE IT REALLY BECOMES A QUESTION OF WEATHER YOU WANT A PARTNERSHIP GAME OR NOT

PARTNERSHIP TRICK TAKING GAMES ARE MY FAVORITE BUT THEY ARE GENERALLY ALSO THE HARDEST TO GET PEOPLE TO PLAY PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE LETTING THEIR PARTNER DOWN ALL THE TIME USUALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE GREAT PARTNERSHIP GAMES INCLUDE EUCHRE AND BRIDGE BOTH ARE PLAYABLE WITH A NORMAL DECK AND WOULD BE HOW I'D START IF YOU'RE UNSURE IF YOU'LL ENJOY IT

FICHU IS ALSO PLAYED PRIMARILY AS PARTNERS BUT IT'S A LADDER CLIMBING GAME WHICH IS SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT IT'S LESS ABOUT TRICKS AND MORE ABOUT EMPTYING YOUR HAND SOME CARDS ARE WORTH POINTS AS WELL I WOULD RECOMMEND TRYING A FEW OTHERS FIRST THAN DIVING INTO FICHU

INDEPENDENT TRICK TAKING GAMES ARE A BETTER PLACE TO START IN MY OPINION IT LETS EVERYONE SINK OR SWIM WHICH WILL MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHEN TO PLAY OFF ON A TRICK AND SAVE THEIR STRENGTH AND WHEN TO GO HOT LEARNING TO VALUE YOUR HAND CURRENTLY IS SO IMPORTANT TO ANY TRICK TAKING GAME WITH BIDDING THAT I'D RECOMMEND WIZARD AS YOUR FIRST OTHER GREAT ONES ARE CLUBS AND DIAMONDS

I HAVEN'T PLAYED THEM BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT HAGGIS THE DWARF KING AND NYET
FICHU IS A LADDER GAME AND CHRONICLE IS QUITE GOOD I WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING AT HONSHU AND ETERNITY BOTH NEW GAMES THIS YEAR I ALSO REALLY LIKE CUCUMBERS AND DIAMONDS
HONSHU FOR THE TRICK TAKING IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE GAME IT COULD BE DESCRIBED AS CARCASSONNE WITH TRICK TAKING TO DECIDE PLAYER ORDER

NYET OTHERWISE YOU HAVE CHANGING RULES OF THE TRICK DECIDED BY PLAYERS AND CHANGING PARTNERSHIPS EACH ROUND DECIDED BY PLAYER ONE THE CHOICES PEOPLE MAKE ON RULES OF THE TRICK SHOULD INFORM WHICH PARTNER YOU WANT TO PICK
I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE CLASSIC EUCHRE ANOTHER ONE THAT LOOKS REALLY COOL IS TAKE THE A CHORD THOUGH IT'S QUITE NEW AND I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT
TRICK OF THE RAILS
KAISER IS A REALLY POPULAR CARD GAME HERE ON THE PRAIRIES IT'S TYPICALLY PLAYED A LOT AT PARTIES AND IN TEAMS OF TWO VERY FUN GAME WITH SIMPLE RULES
LOOKS LIKE A CUSTOM ABALONE BOARD MAYBE
IT'S 2 PLAYER CHINESE CHECKERS THE BOARD LAYOUTS AREN'T STANDARDIZED IN ANY WAY

MAYBE DOMINION OR SOME OTHER DECKBUILDER
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED COSMIC ENCOUNTER
THIS GAME DOESN'T GET TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH IT'S PRETTY BRIEF HAS A LOAD OF CHOICES INTERESTING WORKER PLACEMENT MECHANISM AND IT'S GOT A LITTLE SLIDING ELEVATOR PRETTY EASY TO TEACH BUT I THINK A LOT OF DEPTH AND REPLAY VALUE AS WELL
I'M INTERESTED BECAUSE IT'S FROM HONG KONG IS THERE ANY VIDEO OR PLATIEST HAPPENING
FOR ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN THE GAME HERE'S THE RULEBOOK
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY ISN'T AS HARD TO LEARN AS RACE BUT RACE IS HONESTLY NOT THAT DIFFICULT EITHER THE PLAYER REFERENCE SHEETS ARE THERE FOR A REASON ONCE YOU GET A FEW GAMES DOWN IT BECOMES SECOND NATURE CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ROLL THOUGH IT'S SUCH A SMOOTH GAME AND PLAYS REALLY QUICKLY

HAVEN'T PLAYED SEASONS AT ALL BUT ROLL ISN'T VERY COMPARABLE TO CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THEY'RE JUST COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAMES IN BURGUNDY YOU'RE MANEUVERING AROUND YOUR OPPONENT S TO INTERFERE WITH THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHILE MAKING SURE YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED WHEREAS IN ROLL ALL YOU CAN DO TO INTERACT WITH YOUR OPPONENT IS POTENTIALLY ENABLE ACTIONS FOR THEM TO USE WHILE YOU TRY TO PIGGYBACK OFF OF THEIR MOVES OR END THE GAME YOU ALSO ROLL A BUNCH OF DICE AND GET POTENTIALLY DOZENS OF ACTIONS PER TURN WHEREAS IN COB YOU ONLY GET 2 PLUS BONUSES ROLL CAN ALSO BE REALLY PUNISHING IF YOU CAN'T READ THE MOVES OF OTHER PLAYERS BUT IS STILL OVERALL MORE FORGIVING AND LIGHT THAN COB I REALLY RECOMMEND WATCHING VIDEOS ON ROLL BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES WITHOUT SHOWING THEM
ARE YOU SURE RACE FOR THE GALAXY WON'T WORK IT'S QUITE A BIT EASIER TO LEARN THAN SEASONS AND WAY FASTER AND IT'S SUCH A GOOD 2 PLAYER GAME IT'S MY GAME WITH MY MOTHER TRY PLAYING WITH OPEN HANDS YOUR FIRST TIME YOU CAN BE FINISHED TEACHING IN HALF AN HOUR OR LESS

THERE REALLY AREN'T THAT MANY SIMILAR GAMES THAT ARE GOOD ROLL FOR THE GALAXY FOR INSTANCE IS BETTER AT PLAYER RATHER THAN WITH THE DUMMY PLAYER
I'VE PLAYED BOTH IF YOU COUNT THE DIGITAL VERSION OF SAN JUAN I LIKE BOTH HONESTLY I AM CONSIDERING BUYING THE SAN JUAN PHYSICAL VERSION AS WELL THEY ARE PRETTY SIMILAR BUT ROLL HAS TONS OF LITTLE DICE PLASTIC CUPS AND A BAG FULL OF TILES IT'S A LITTLE MOST BUT NOT BY MUCH WOULD SHE LIKE IT HARD TO SAY

I KINDA WANT TO SUGGEST SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT IF THAT'S OK LEGACY THE TESTAMENT OF DUKE DE CRECY IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AND A LITTLE BIT OF IN A WAY AS YOU BUILD OUT YOUR FAMILY TREE IT HAS MORE DEPTH THAN ROLL IN MY OPINION BECAUSE YOU GET SECRET OBJECTIVES AND YOU CAN EARN POINTS IN A LOT OF WAYS I DUNNO MY WIFE JUST REALLY LIKES IT AND SO DO I LOVE IT EVENING IF I HAVE TO PICK TO PLAY BETWEEN ROLL AND LEGACY I GO WITH LEGACY AS LONG AS IT'S JUST THE TWO OF US MY TABLE CAN'T FIT MORE THAN 2 PLAYERS FOR LEGACY SMALLISH TABLE FAMILY TREES TAKE UP A LOT OF ROOM
MY GO TO GAMES FOR DICE ALLOCATION ARE MARCO POLO AND GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL HOWEVER THERE IS SOME ICONOGRAPHY IN BOTH OF THEM ESPECIALLY GA NOT AS BAD AS RACE THOUGH AND MOST OF THE ICONS ARE INTUITIVE
COB IS A FANTASTIC GAME THAT IS EASY TO LEARN HARD TO MASTER HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
WHY IS SHE MPH ON SAN JUAN JUST BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIGHT

SAN JUAN SEEMS REALLY LIGHT ON THE FIRST COUPLE PLAYS BUT THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF STRATEGY THAT CAN BE EXPLORED WITH SUBSEQUENT PLAYS I WAS PRETTY MPH ON IT AS WELL BUT I LIKE IT MORE AS I'VE PLAYED IT A BIT MORE THE LIGHTNESS MAY STEM FROM IT HAVING FEW MECHANICS AND SIMPLE SCORING BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S NOT TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC DEPTH DEPENDING ON WHAT CARDS YOU GET EARLY IN THE GAME THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT STRATEGIES YOU CAN GO FOR

ROLL IS CENTERED AROUND THE DICE ASSIGNMENT MECHANISM WHICH I THINK IS REALLY INTERESTING OTHER THAN THAT IT'S A LOT LIKE SAN JUAN THERE IS ACTUALLY MORE VARIATION IN BUILDING ABILITIES IN SAN JUAN WHICH LENDS ITS SELF TO BEING ABLE TO DO MULTIPLE SMALL STRATEGIES WHERE TILES ARE MOSTLY ABOUT EITHER DICE ASSIGNMENT ABILITIES OR HAVING ONE OF THE FEWER MAIN LONG TERM STRATEGIES

I'M GLAD I HAVE BOTH THOUGH I REALLY LIKE THESE SIMULTANEOUS ACTION GAMES IT KEEPS EVERYONE ENGAGED BECAUSE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ON EVERYONE TURN
I HAVEN'T PLAYED RACE BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ROLL AND MOVING FROM SAN JUAN ACTUALLY HELPS LEARN ROLL CONSIDERABLY BECAUSE THEY SHARE THE SAME GAMEPLAY ONLY THING TO KNOW ABOUT ROLL WALKING IN IS THAT THERE'S NEARLY ZERO PLAYER INTERACTION BUT IF YOU ENJOY BUILDING ENGINES AND JUST TRYING TO BUILD SOMETHING BETTER THAN YOUR OPPONENTS FASTEST I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER
SAN JUAN IS EASIER TO LEARN THERE ARE TILES TO GRAB WHEN YOU CHOOSE ONE OF THE ROLES OTHER THAN THE CONCEPT I THINK IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO LEARN

THERE IS ONE SPECIAL RULE TO REMEMBER FOR A GAME ONE PLAYER GETS TWO PICKS PER ROUND

I LIKE RACE AND ROLL AS WELL BUT I THINK SAN JUAN WORKS WELL BECAUSE THE LEARNING CURVE FOR THE MECHANISMS IS LESS STEEP AND YOU CAN CONCENTRATE MORE ON STRATEGIES WHILE PLAYING

IT'S ALSO A LOT CHEAPER
IF THE CHOICE IS BETWEEN ROLL FOR THE GALAXY AND SAN JUAN DEFINITELY GO FOR ROLL
BATTLEDORE IS A PHENOMENAL GAME I BELIEVE IT'S DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO INCLUDE AMONG OTHER C C GAMES AS MUCH AS I LOVE MEMOIR SOME OF THE MECHANICS SEEM A BIT CLUNKY AFTER BATTLEDORE

THE SETUP TIME ISN'T AS BAD AS YOU THINK I'D USE THE PREMADE ARMIES FOR A BIT UNTIL YOU GET USED TO THE UNITS AFTER YOU KNOW THE UNITS IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH LONGER TO SETUP THAN MEMOIR

I CAN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT BOW I'VE ONLY TRIED IT ONCE AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT AS MUCH
IF YOU DIDN'T REALIZE BATTLEDORE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY DISCONTINUED NOW DUE TO RUNE WARS THE MINIATURES GAME FANTASY FLIGHT HAD EVERYTHING DISCOUNTED ABOUT OFF ON THEIR SALES SITE
IF YOU REALLY LIKE C C I DON'T SEE WHY NOT THOSE GAMES ARE FAIRLY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER AS FAR AS C C TITLES GO I DON'T CONSIDER BOW TO BE A REAL C C GAME FOR MANY REASONS AND I ALSO DON'T CARE FOR IT

I HAVE SEVERAL C C TITLES AND MY ONLY REGRET IS GOING TOO HEAVY ON EXPANSIONS FOR SOME OF THEM MEMOIR ESPECIALLY LOOKING BACK I'D RATHER HAVE SPENT THE MONEY ON DIFFERENT C C BASE GAMES AS THE BASE GAMES TEND TO HAVE MORE CONTENT THAN EXPANSIONS DO
THE CHART SHOULD BE IN THE BACK OF THE RULES BOOK FOR THE EXPANSION

IF THAT ISN'T THE CASE I'D BE RETURNING IT TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A REFUND
THE CHART ISN'T IN THE BACK OF THE RULES BOOK AS FAR AS I'M AWARE IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE SMALLER BOOKLET THAT STARTS OFF WITH THE CREATOR'S LETTER TO THE CONSUMER THAT SAME BOOKLET ALSO LISTS THE NEW RULES SUCH AS WHAT TILES GO ON THE ROOF
PM ME IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT IN THE RULEBOOK AND I'LL TAKE A PICTURE OF MINE AND SEND IT TO YOU RIGHT AFTERWARDS
I POSTED ONE A BIT AGO ON BG
NICE COLLECTION
NICE COLLECTION WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE GAMES WHICH ONES ARE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AND WHY
THERE AREN'T A TON OF GAMES THAT HAVE THAT TYPE OF RANGE FOR A PLAYER COUNT BUT WONDERS SCALES VERY WELL FROM PLAYERS IT'S NOT CO-OP BUT IT'S ONE OF THE MOST FUN DRAFTING GAMES OUT THERE IF YOU LIKE CO-OP GAMES LIKE THE GRIZZLED GOOD LUCK TOUGH GAME MORE YOU MIGHT LIKE THINGS LIKE FORBIDDEN DESERT PLAYERS OR SPACE ALERT BEST WITH OR PLAYERS WHICH ARE BOTH CO-OP GAMES I'VE HAD LOTS OF FUN WITH

SUSPICION THE TARGET EXCLUSIVE PERHAPS
MYSTERY EXPRESS
IT'S NOT FIST OF DRAGON STONES IS IT I DON'T REMEMBER THAT GAME HAVING DEDUCTION BUT IT SOUNDS CLOSE
MY MAIN ISSUE WITH HEAVIER EURO GAMES SPECIFICALLY IS THAT THEY SEEM GENERALLY TO BE COMPLEXITY FOR SAKE I DON'T MIND A COMPLEX GAME I ENJOY WARGAMES FROM CHITS TO BLOCKS TO MINIATURES WHICH ON AVERAGES ARE MORE COMPLEX THAN HEAVY EURO GAMES WHEN EURO GAMES GET THEIR HANDS ON COMPLEXITY IT GENERALLY IS DONE BY TAKING AN DECISION PATH THAT BEEN QUITE SHORT AND STRETCHING IT OUT FOR NO REASON INSTEAD OF JUST GETTING WOOD YOU HAVE TO GET FISH WHICH YOU CONVERT TO SMOKED FISH WHICH YOU TRADE FOR WOOD I'M NOT A FAN OF GAMES WHICH INFLATE THE TIME AND OVERHEAD OF HOW YOU PLAY FOR NO REASON I WANT THAT COMPLEXITY TO BE THERE FOR A REASON WARGAMES CAN BE GUILTY OF THIS AS WELL BUT I FIND IT'S GENERALLY BETTER JUSTIFIED THERE

I ALSO GENERALLY DON'T FIND WHAT I FIND TO BE THE BIGGEST GENRES OF HEAVY EURO INTERESTING ECONOMICS IS FINE BUT NOT FUN FOR ME AND RESOURCE GATHERING AND CONVERTING IS FINE WHEN YOU ARE GETTING RESOURCES AND USING THEM BELFORT SCOVILLE LORDS OF WATERDEEP BUT WHEN YOU ADD LIKE THREE EXTRA STEPS FOR NO REASON I'M NOT INTERESTED THOSE STEPS GENERALLY AREN'T INTERESTING AT ALL

AS SOMEONE WHO HAS DESIGNED GAMES PROFESSIONALLY AND AS A HOBBY I GUESS I JUST KNOW WHAT I LIKE I THINK MANY HEAVY EUROS WOULD BE BETTER GAMES IF THEY WERE MEDIUM WEIGHT AND REMOVED THE FILLER ACTIONS I SUBSCRIBE TO THE LESS IS MORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY THAT A GAME IS GOOD WHEN THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO TAKE AWAY

BUT PEOPLE LIKE THEM THAT'S COOL I JUST GENERALLY DON'T GET A HALF CHUB FROM HEAVY EUROS
I HAVE A SERIES OF LONG GAMES TIME GENERALLY ISN'T A BIG PROBLEM UNTIL WE HIT MY GRIPE IS THERE BETTER BE A SOLID PAY OFF FOR THAT TIME THAT GIVES ME A REASON FOR ALL THAT TIME FOR EXAMPLE LIBERTE ACCOMPLISHES THE SAME THING IN TERMS OF OBJECTIVE AND SIMILAR CALCULATIONS AS THE KING IS DEAD BUT TAKES AS LONG HENCE I LOVE KID AND TRADED AWAY LIBERTE
FOR ME HEAVY GAMES HAVE TWO PROBLEMS

ONE THEME HEAVY GAMES TEND TO HAVE PRETTY DRY THEMES I KNOW SOME PEOPLE DON'T MIND AND THAT'S FINE I THOUGH LIKE TO PLAY COOL CRAZY THEMES TENDING A FARM DOESN'T REALLY INSPIRE ME SO I'M LESS WILLING TO PUT UP WITH WHATEVER ELSE THE GAME HAS TO OFFER

TWO COMPLEXITY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEANINGFUL CHOICES AND TONS OF INFORMATION AGAIN PERSONAL TASTE BUT I ACTUALLY PREFER MAKING MEANINGFUL CHOICES WITH LIMITED INFORMATION TRYING TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS I CAN'T COMPLETELY PREDICTION RISK MANAGEMENT IF YOU WILLIAM WHEN THE GAME JUST THROWS A LOT OF INFORMATION AGAINST ME AND EXPECTS ME TO PLAN THREE TURNS AHEAD I GET OVERWHELMED


SO MAYBE SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS FEEL LIKE I DO ASK THEM ABOUT THAT MAYBE MORE THEME WOULD HELP THEM DEAL WITH THE ADDED RULES I KNOW IT WORKS FOR ME
I LOVE HEAVY GAMES FOR THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THEY FORCE YOU TO MAKE A LIGHT GAME MIGHT BE FINE FOR MINUTES WHILE WE WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO ARRIVE BUT A GOOD 2 HOUR MEATY GAME IS WHAT I GO OUT FOR

THE ONLY QUALITIES ONE NEEDS TO LIKE HEAVY GAMES IS TO BE UP FOR A CHALLENGE EVEN AFTER A WORK UNLESS I'M TIRED FROM WORK AND SICK I STILL LIKE TO FIGHT FOR MY FUN

MY FAVORITES AGE OF STEAM RULES ARE LIGHTER THAT MANY GAMES IT'S THE PLAYER INTERACTION THAT MAKES THIS ONE HEAVY THE GREAT ZIMBABWE LIKELY FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE SOON I JUST FINISHED UP MY SOLO PLAY TO LEARN THE RULES AND THERE'S JUST SO MUCH I WANT TO TRY AGE OF INDUSTRY KEYFLOWER FALLING SKY POWER GRID DELUXE AND TO EDGE PEOPLE CLOSER TO THE HARD SIDE PELOPONNESE A GAME WITH A BIT OF BITE
I USED TO LIKE HEAVIER MORE COMPLEX GAMES FOR THEIR INTRICATE BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS AND THE WAY YOU ARE ABLE TO USE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FIND COOL COMBINATIONS OF ACTIONS AND LACK OF LUCK FOR THE MOST PART

NOWADAYS I USUALLY STAY AWAY FROM THESE TYPES OF GAMES BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE WORK FOR ME I HAVE THE TENDENCY TO TRY AND OPTIMIZE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN GAMES WHERE YOU GET MORE AND MORE OPTIONS EVERY TURN THIS CAN EASILY LEAD TO AP AND BRAIN OVERLOAD ALSO SOMETIMES AFTER MAKING MY TURN I NOTICE THAT I OVERLOOKED SOMETHING AND THEN I GET FRUSTRATED FOR NOT PLAYING OPTIMALLY
THESE GAMES ALSO TEND TO TAKE A LONG TIME TO PLAY AND TEACH
SO MY OVERALL ENJOYMENT OF HEAVY GAMES IS A LOT LOWER THAN MEDIUM COMPLEX GAMES
SOMETHING LIKE MOMBASA IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLEX I WANT TO PLAY
FOR THE REASONS MENTIONED ABOVE I DIDN'T ENJOY PLAYING PANAMA LE HAVRE CAVERN TZOLKIN ALCHEMISTS KANKAN ETC AS MUCH AS I SHOULD I CAN RECOGNIZE THESE ARE GREAT GAMES BUT I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THEM

I LIKE HEAVIER GAMES BECAUSE I FEEL MORE OF A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND FULFILMENT AFTER HAVING PLAYED THEM IF I'VE GOT TWO OR THREE HOURS WHICH DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN THESE DAYS THANKS TO A NEW YOUNG CHILD I'D USUALLY RATHER FILL THAT UP WITH ONE BIG ENDEAVOUR THAN FOUR OR FIVE SMALLER ONES IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION WHEN I GET TO PULL OUT ROADS BOATS OR VINOS BUT I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE GAMES AND I REMEMBER THEM MUCH MORE VIVIDLY THAN I RECALL THE DOZENS OF PLAYS OF ARBORETUM OR NO THANKS WHICH ARE GREAT GAMES BUT NOT NEARLY AS MEMORABLE

PERHAPS THIS IS BECAUSE HEAVIER GAMES TEND TO TRY TO BUILD MORE THEME THROUGH THEIR MECHANICS THAN A LIGHTER GAME WHICH TENDS TO FOCUS MORE ON THE PUZZLE AND OVERLAY A SIMPLE PASTED ON THEME VINOS IS DEFINITELY NOT A PASTED ON THEME THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THAT GAME THAT SIMULATES THE INDUSTRY




I LIKE HEAVY GAMES THAT COMBINE A SIMPLE CHOICE WITH HIGH IMPACT

BRASS DISCARD A CARD TO PERFORM AN ACTION AROUND OF THE TIME WHATS ON THE CARD DOESN'T MATTER BUT BY DOING SO YOU'RE GIVING UP FUTURE POSSIBILITIES ON WHAT ACTIONS YOU CAN TAKE THAT NEED THE CARDS

DO I PLACE WORKERS OR REMOVE WORKERS

WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS COMPLEXITY IN THE RULE SET I DON'T WANT TO READ PAGES OF RULES TO BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME NOTE GLOSSARIES OF ACTIONS ARE FINE AS YOU CAN USE THEM TO CLARIFY DURING THE GAME
HEAVY GAMES ARE THE BEST LIGHT GAMES OFTEN TEND TO FEEL LIKE A SPRINT IT'S OVER QUICKLY AND YOU DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING HEAVIER GAMES ARE ENDURANCE GAMES AND MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE ACHIEVED SOMETHING AT THE END OF IT IF YOU MESS UP AT THE BEGINNING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO COME BACK IN MANY LIGHT GAMES OR THEY ADD CATCH UP MECHANICS THAT MAKE IT TOO EASY TO COME BACK IN HEAVIER GAMES YOU CAN MESS UP BUT YOU CAN POTENTIALLY COME BACK OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT MAKE A FEW MISTAKES AS WELL

LIST OF HEAVY GAMES I'VE PLAYED AND ENJOYED TWILIGHT STRUGGLE PATHS OF GLORY CRY HAVOC WAR OF THE RING THROUGH THE AGES TWILIGHT IMPERIUM CHURCHILL GENESIS EMPIRES AND KINGDOMS OF THE ANCIENT MIDDLE EASTERN
IT'S ALL RELATIVE TOO YESTERDAY PLAYING CODENAMES WITH A NON GAMING GROUP WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH ONE PLAYER WAS OF THE HURRY UP COME ON COME ON TYPE THE INSTANT THE OTHER TEAMS CODERIVING TURN STARTED ZERO PATIENCE I HAD BROUGHT AVALON TOO AND I KNEW IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE SUCCESFUL WITH THEM BUT I ALSO KNEW THERE WASN'T A CHANCE I HELL THEY WOULD HAVE THE PATIENCE TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY THAT HAPPENS OFTEN I PRETTY SURE YOU'D LIKE THIS GAME IF YOU UNDERSTOOD HOW TO PLAY BUT IM PRETTY SURE YOU WONT HAVE THE PATIENCE TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY AND A CAVEAT I CAN'T STAND PLAYING WITH HURRY UP HURRY UP PLAYERS I'D RATHER PLAY WITH AP THAN RUSHERS I KNOW I'M I THE MINORITY ON THAT ONE
I CANNOT STAND LIGHT GAMES

IF A GAME DOES NOT COMMAND MY ENTIRE ATTENTION IT DOES NOT HELP REMOVE STRESS FROM MY MIND AND I AM STILL STUCK AT WORK OR STILL PARTIALLY THINKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN LIFE I ESPECIALLY CANNOT STAND PLAYING LIGHT GAMES WITH PEOPLE WHO FAR EXCEED THEIR EXPECTED PLAYTIME BY TRYING TO MATH THEM TO DEATH OR OTHERWISE OVERTHINK THEM CODENAMES IS FINE WITH THE TIMER WITHOUT IT'S TORTURE

HOWEVER I'VE NOTICED THAT I HAVE SOME FRIENDS THAT TUNE OUT DURING THESE GAMES OR LOOK BORED EVEN DURING THE RULES EXPLANATION

THIS DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T ENJOY THAT WEIGHT OF THE GAME THAT CAN BE THEY DON'T LEARN GAMES FROM AUDITORY RULES EXPLANATIONS AND WOULD DO BETTER WITH A PLAYER AID OR SAMPLE ROUND OTHER PEOPLE PLAY GAMES TO WIN NOT TO PLAY AND DISLIKE NEW COMPLEX GAMES THEY CAN'T IMMEDIATELY SEE HOW TO WIN IN

EVEN ENJOY LEARNING THE GAME AND SEEING IT ALL COME TOGETHER I SEE A COMPLEX GAME BOARD AND I CAN'T WAIT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL EVERYTHING MEANS

THIS PLEASURABLE RUSH OF DISCOVERY IS A TRAIT OF ADD PEOPLE BTW NOT SAYING YOU ARE BUT YOU MAY FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIMILAR FEELINGS THERE ARE EASIER PARTNERS IN YOUR COMPLEX GAMING
IN ADDITION TO OTHER REASONS CITED HERE I JUST LIKE IMPERFECT INFORMATION AND YES RANDOMNESS
I LIKE HEAVY GAMES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN ONES IS THEY LAST LONG ENOUGH TO GET INVESTED WITH A LOT OF GAMES BY THE TIME THINGS GET REALLY INTERESTING THE GAME IS MINUTES AWAY FROM BEING OVER ANYWAY WITH TWILIGHT IMPERIUM ONCE EVERYONE HAS FINISHED THE INITIAL EXPANSION AND STARTED WORKING DOWN THE TECH TREE THINGS ARE JUST GETTING STARTED ALTHOUGH THAT BEING SAID SOMETIMES IT'S NICE TO PLAY SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK AS HARD ABOUT ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLE GAMES IN THE EVENING
THEY'RE ALSO DOING BUY ONE GET ONE HALF OFF ON ALL OF THEIR BOARDGAMES


THEIR SELECTION CONTINUES TO IMPROVE SO IT'S A GOOD CHANCE TO PICK UP SOME STAPLES THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE
BARNES AND NOBLE IN MY AREA IS ALSO RUNNING A OFF WHITE DOT SALE WHICH INCLUDES ALL BOARDGAMES DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN COMBINE THEM OR IF ALL STORES WILL HAVE THE WHITE DOT

HAMM DEAD OF WINTER FOR THAT'S PRETTY TEMPTING
GOT EMAILS TOO

GOT THE BLACK FRIDAY I HAVE COUPON FROM BACK IN THE DAY JUST FOR BEING A MEMBER ALSO GOT EVERYTHING FOR BEING A MEMBER

ON TOP OF THAT IN GIFT CARDS GETS YOU A FREE BUT I BELIEVE IT CAN'T BE USED TIL LATER SO PAY ATTENTION

HOPEFULLY I CAN FIND SOMETHING ODDLY I'M NOT REALLY CRAVING ANYTHING MAYBE A RANDOM WORKER PLACEMENT I NEED A DIFFERENT TYPE OF GAME FROM THE STUFF I HAVE
WELL DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF EXPANSIONS YOU HAVE FOR THE CGS AND MINIATURE GAMES THIS CAN BE A VERY IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION

WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE GAME

YOU THINK MARKHAM HORROR AND LORD OF THE RINGS ARE DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO KEEP BOTH


I WORK AT A FAGS TOO IF I HAD PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH ON THE REGULAR I WOULD OWN MORE GAMES AS IT STANDS I ONLY OWN TAKENOKO

I DO GET TO TAKE DEMO GAMES WHEN EVER I WANT TOO THOUGH

I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BUY BETRAYAL SOON JUST SO I CAN HAVE IT
HOW DO YOU LIKE RAPTOR
I LIKE MEXICAN TRAIN A LOT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT COUNTS AS A TRADITIONAL DOMINO GAME
MY FAMILY HAS BEEN PLAYING CHICKEN FOOT FOR YEARS

EDIT REDDIN CAN'T HANDLE LINKS WITH PARENTHESES APPARENTLY


IS MY FAVORITE GAME TO PLAY BAR NONE NO AMOUNT OF FANCY CARDBOARD AND CLEVER MECHANICS CAN BEAT A GAME OF WITH THREE OTHER FRIENDS AND A PITCHER OF BEER IT'S A GAME WITH PARTNERS WHERE EACH DOMINO THAT'S A MULTIPLE OF FIVE ADDS EXTRA POINTS

HERE'S THE RULES

THIS GAME LOOKS SO MUCH FUN TO ME AND I'M NOT INVESTED IN THE ANDROID UNIVERSE AT ALL
GOT A CHANCE TO PLAY THIS AT LAST WEEK AND LOVED IT ALL MY FAVORITE PARTS OF BG BUT MORE INTERACTION FELT FASTER MOVING AND A LITTLE MORE INTENSE

IT WAS GREAT
A MINIMUM OF PLAYERS SAD FACE
WHY DOES WEYLAND HAVE NO CEO I'D THOUGHT THAT JACK WEYLAND WOULD BE THEIR CEO
HOW MANY CORES DO I NEED TO BUY AND WILL IT BE ANY GOOD WITHOUT EXPANSIONS
I WAS THINKING THAT A CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD WOULD BE GOOD FOR ANDROID UNIVERSE THIS IS BETTER THAN THAT
EVERY TIME I FIND SOMETHING OUT ABOUT THIS GAME I WANTED IT MORE AND MORE NOW I AM POSITIVE I WILL GET IT BUT I AM STILL BUMMED IT'S A MINIMUM OF
TRIED THIS AT BG CON I REALLY LIKE THE ANDROID UNIVERSE BUT I AM NOT A FAN OF BG SO THIS DIDNT APPEAL TO ME
OK THIS GAME READS LIKE YOU NEED TO KNOW THE BACKSTORY OF THE UNIVERSE I'M NOT INTO A NR IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN READ TO GET INTO THIS
TOO MANY CARDS WITH UNIQUE POWERS I JUST CAN'T ENJOY A GAME IF I HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND MEMORISE THE CONTENT OF SEVERAL DECKS BEFORE I WANT TO BE COMPETITIVE
ANYONE READ THIS IS IT BETTER THAN FEUDUM
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU PLAYING WITH I LOVE THE ROBBER TANNER TROUBLEMAKER SEER BOTH WEREWOLF THE HUNTER AND THE DRUNK
SO WHEN YOU'RE DESIGNING A GAME OF ONUS THE GOAL IS USUALLY TO BALANCE MECHANICS TRY TO NEVER INCLUDE ENOUGH WOLVES SO THAT OR MORE OF THE TABLE COULD BE WOLVES AT A TIME JUST UNDER THAT IS USUALLY PERFECT IF POSSIBLE
NEXT YOU'RE BALANCING ROLES THAT CREATE CHAOS AND ROLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION AND MOST ROLES FALL SOMEWHERE ON THE SPECTRUM BETWEEN THOSE TWO

CHAOS TROUBLEMAKER IS THE BIGGEST CHAOS CARD SINCE THE END RESULT IS THAT NOBODY REALLY KNOW QUITE WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY GO RELATIVELY LATE IN THE NIGHT BY SWAPPING TWO OTHER PLAYERS YOU'RE EXTREMELY LIKELY TO MESS UP PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE UNDERSTANDING OT AFFAIRS THEN DRUNK LESS TROUBLESOME BECAUSE THEY ONLY DISRUPT THEIR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES INSTEAD OF 2 OTHER PLAYERS

ROBBER IS PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY IN THE MIDDLE SINCE THEY CREATE ONE CHANGE BUT ALSO REVEAL ONE ROLE MAYBE A SLIGHT BIAS TO CHAOS SINCE THEY WON'T NECESSARILY SHARE WHAT THEY KNOW SELF PRESERVATION AND WHAT NOT

INFORMATION SEER IS EFFECTIVELY THE OPPOSITE OF TROUBLEMAKER PURE INFORMATION INSOMNIAC IS THE OPPOSITE OF DRUNK
EVERYTHING ELSE PROVIDES INTERESTING TWEAKS TO THE DISCUSSION DYNAMICS AND SERVE TO BIAS THE GAME ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

TANNER BIAS TOWARDS WOLVES MAKES IT HARDER TO DETERMINE WHY A PLAYER IS BEHAVING STRANGELY

HUNTER BIAS TOWARDS VILLAGERS REDUCES THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE INCORRECT CHOICES KILL HIM GET A SECOND CHANCE

MINION BIAS TOWARDS WOLVES OBVIOUS REASONS CAN BE SWAPPED FOR A WOLF IF VILLAGERS ARE STRUGGLING OR USED TO AUGMENT THEM IF THEY ARE

MASONS BIAS TOWARDS VILLAGERS SLIGHTLY MORE INFORMATION

DOPPELGANGER WILD CARD DON'T USE UNTIL EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS ALL THE ROLES THEN USE FREQUENTLY

SO POSSIBLE OPTIONS

2 WOLVES SEER ROBBER TROUBLEMAKER

2 WOLVES SEER ROBBER TROUBLEMAKER TANNER

2 WOLVES MINION SEER ROBBER TROUBLEMAKER ANY THIS SHOULD BE PRETTY BALANCED

2 WOLVES MINION SEER ROBBER TROUBLEMAKER TANNER INSOMNIAC

2 WOLVES MINION SEER ROBBER TROUBLEMAKER TANNER MASONS

2 WOLVES MINION SEER ROBBER TROUBLEMAKER TANNER DRUNK INSOMNIAC HUNTER
I WOULD SAY THROW AWAY THE VILLAGERS THROW IN EVERYTHING ELSE I

T MIGHT TAKE GAMES FOR EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLES ESPECIALLY THE MORE COMPLICATED ONES BUT THE GAMES ARE SHORT SO YOU CAN AFFORD A FEW GAMES WHERE THE WEREWOLVES STRAIGHT UP WIN BEFORE EVERYONE GOOKS WHAT IS GOING ON
FIRST OF ALL RELAX THERE IS AN INSANE AMOUNT OF GAMES OUT THERE AND YES IT CAN BE WORRYING THAT YOU MIGHT BE MAKING THE WRONG CHOICES FOR THIS REASON I'M GOING TO TELL YOU AT LEAST FOR NOW TO IGNORE KICKSTARTER I'M A HUGE FAN OF KICKSTARTER BUT I THINK OUT OF THE GAMES I'VE BACKED ONLY AROUND OF THEM HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN WORTH IT
NEXT GO WITH WHAT YOU KNOW ZOMBICIDE MANSIONS OF MADNESS YOU ENJOY THEM YOU GET THEM ARRANGE AN AFTERNOON WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND PLAY THROUGH THE GAMES SEE WHAT THEY LIKE AND WHAT YOU ALL ENJOY ABOUT THE GAMES DON'T OVER ANALYZE JUST STICK WITH THE BASICS
I WOULD FOR NOW SUGGEST AVOIDING DARK SOULS IT LOOKS AWESOME BUT RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE STILL DESIGNING THE GAME AS THEY GO WHICH IS WORRYING THAT'S BEFORE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT IT'S A LARGE FINANCIAL COMMITMENT BEFORE EXPANSIONS DOOM ON THE OTHER HAND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT AS I DON'T MIND THE GM ASPECT AND LIKE YOURSELF ENJOYED THE GAME THE ORIGINAL DOOM BOARD GAME WAS ALSO THE FIRST BOARD GAME I REALLY WANTED SO I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF NOSTALGIA FOR IT IT'S ALSO APPARENTLY SIMILAR IN STYLE TO DESCENT SO THIS MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU
IF IT HELPS THERE ARE A LOT OF GAMES THAT HAVE SIMILAR LESS COMPLEX VERSIONS PANDEMIC FOR EXAMPLE IS VERY POPULAR START WITH THE ORIGINAL HOWEVER CO-OP GAMES AREN'T FOR EVERYONE SO INSTEAD PICK UP FORBIDDEN DESERT OR FORBIDDEN ISLAND DESIGNED BY THE SAME GUY SIMILAR KIND OF CO-OP BUT ALSO CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER ANOTHER GAME I PICKED UP WAS HAVE TO ESCAPE FROM THE DRAGON'S DUNGEON WHICH YOU BUILD YOURSELF AS YOU MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH IT STEALING GOLD AND SCREWING OVER YOUR FRIENDS
IF IN DOUBT I WOULD SUGGEST STARTING WITH SETTLERS OF CATAN CARCASSONNE FORBIDDEN DESERT ISLAND KING OF TOKYO NEW YORK AND GLOOM

CATAN IS ABOUT EXPLORING AND BUILDING AN ISLAND COMMUNITY TRADING PRODUCE BUILDING ROADS AND SETTLEMENTS
CARCASSONNE IS SIMILAR BUT PRIMARILY TILE BASED BOTH GAMES HAVE MULTIPLE EXPANSIONS THAT ARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO YOUR ENJOYMENT
KING OF NEW YORK TOKYO IS A DICE ROLLING GODZILLA KING KONG STYLE GAME FIGHTING OFF OTHER MONSTERS AND THE ARMY CLASSIC AMERITRASH I BELIEVE
GLOOM IT'S A CARD GAME WHERE YOU'RE TELLING THE STORY OF HOW YOUR FAMILY DIES IT'S GIMMICK IS THAT IT'S PRINTED IN CLEAR PLASTIC SO WHEN YOU LAY A CARD ON TOP OF ANOTHER IT CHANGED THE MODIFIERS THAT INEVITABLY RESULT IN YOUR FAMILY'S DEATHS IT'S CASUAL SO HALF THE FUN IS THE OPTIONAL STORYTELLING ASPECT WHICH AFFECT THE GAME IN NO REAL WAY BUT ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE

HOPEFULLY THIS HELPS YOU A LITTLE
WELL KINGDOM DEATH KS STARTS IN HOURS MY BEST FRIEND SAID I WOULD BE MAD WITH BEGRETT IF I LET IT PASS THIS IS AFTER PLAYING SOMETHING OF HOURS PLAYING AND STILL NOT EVEN AT OF THE GAME

IF YOU LIKE A GAME GET IT IF YOU HAVE A BOARD GAME CAFE ANYWHERE NEAR YOU GET SOME FRIENDS AND PLATIEST THE GAMES YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PURCHASING READ THE RULES BEFOREHAND THOUGH

IF YOU LIKED MANSIONS OF MADNESS LOOK INTO ELDER SIGN AND ITS EXPANSIONS YOU COLLECT STUFF DEFEAT ROOMS AND FACE AN ELDER GOD

ZOMBICIDE IS GREAT A GAME SIMILAR TO ZOMBICIDE IS DEAD OF WINTER IT'S CO-OP BUT EVERYONE HAS SECRET MISSIONS THERE ARE ZOMBIES WEAPONS AN INTERESTING DICE MECHANIC AND COOL CHARACTERS THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF ACTION LOTS OF ZOMBIES AND LOTS OF DANGER

IF YOU LIKE RAGS TRY ABOVE AND BELOW IT'S AN EXPLORING AND CITY BUILDING GAME GORGEOUS EASY TO LEARN YOU SEND YOUR WORKERS ON ADVENTURES UNDERGROUND AND NEVER KNOW WHAT SCENARIO THEY'LL RUN INTO

BUY THE GAMES YOU ENJOY AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT ITS RATING REVIEWS UNLESS IT HAS TRULY UNFORGIVABLE MISTAKES
STAY AWAY FROM KICKSTARTERS IF YOU'RE NEW TO THE HOBBY THERE'S TONS OF BOARD GAMES YOU CAN BUY WITH WAITING AND RISK SO DON'T BACK A KICKSTARTER GAME WHEN YOU COULD JUST BUY A GAME ON AMAZON INSTEAD

IT'S ALSO PRETTY RARE FOR A KICKSTARTER GAME TO NEVER HIT RETAIL THESE DAYS DON'T KICK-START IT UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT IT JUST AS A COLLECTOR'S ITEM

APART FROM THE STUFF YOU MENTIONED YOU MIGHT TAKE A LOOK AT KROSMASTER ARENA OR KROSMASTER QUEST IF YOU WANT SOMETHING CO-OP DUNGEON RPG STYLE COMBAT WITH A LOT OF DEPTH AND TACTICS NOT PLAYING IN TEAMS IS ALSO A GOOD OPTION FOR LARGER GROUPS ALSO HAS A RIDICULOUSLY MASSIVE NUMBER EXPANSIONS FOR BOTH MAPS AND CHARACTERS BUT DON'T BE INTIMIDATED IT'S FUN WITH JUST THE BASE SET

MICE AND MYSTICS SEEMS LIKE EXACTLY KIND OF THE THING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR CO-OP HAS A CAMPAIGN COMBAT WITH LOTS OF ENEMIES RPG MECHANICS AND A NICE STORY NOT TOO COMPLICATED EITHER AND IT HAS EXPANSIONS IF YOU FINISH THE CAMPAIGN AND WANT NEW STUFF TO FIGHT


I THINK YOU'RE JUST PLAYING RPG A LIKES THAT'S FINE BUT YOU REALLY GOTTA KNOW YOU'RE DOING THAT AND NOT PLAYING THE ENTIRE FIELD OF GAMES

YOU MAY LIKE A REAL RPG MORE OR A EUROGAME OR TWO OR ONE OF THE MODERN HYBRIDS WHICH HAS FIGHTING BUT ISN'T A DIE ROLLER YOU MAY EVEN ENJOY A LONG GAME THAT IS COMPLEX INSTEAD OF JUST LONG

CHECK OUT EMET QUARTERMASTER GENERAL AND ABOVE AND BELOW TO BRANCH OUT
DELETED
RATHER THAN USING GENERIC SPIE AND RESISTANCE MEMBERS ADD ROLES AND IGNORE THEM IF YOU'RE PLAYING VANILLA RESISTANCE

I THINK THE ACCEPT REJECT TOKENS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SELECTED FOR MISSION ONES THESE CAN BE DOUBLE SIDED CARDS WHEN I PLAY THESE ARE LEFT ON THE TABLE UNTIL THE START OF THE NEXT VOTE THAT WAY THEY'RE VISIBLE WHEN WE'RE READY TO HURL ACCUSATIONS

I'M A BIG FAN OF THE INQUISITOR VARIANT LADY OF THE LAKE IN AVALON AND IT'S JUST ONE MORE CARD THREE MORE IF YOU WANT TO MIX INQUISITOR WITH ROLES BUT I USUALLY JUST DO ONE OR THE OTHER

I WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH THE TEAM LEADER OR RULES CARDS
IMO THE VOTE CARDS ARE WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVEN THE ROUND CARDS AND VICTORY MARKER CARDS WHICH CAN JUST EASILY BE TRACKED WITH COINS HEADS TAILS OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU HAVE LYING AROUND

I WOULD HATE TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH A THUMBS UP THUMBS DOWN KIND OF METHOD IT WOULD CHANGE THE GAME TOO MUCH SLOW IT DOWN AND BEING ABLE TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHO VOTED WHAT AFTER THE FACT IS A LARGE PART OF THIS GAME

YOU COULD ALSO SAVE A FEW CARDS BY PUTTING THE RULES ON THE TOUCHBOX ITSELF AND OR JUST HAVING THEM ON YOUR PHONE
FOR THE BASIC GAME EVERY CARD IS ESSENTIALLY A YES NO CARD YOU COULD IMPROVISE A GAME WITH A REGULAR DECK OF PLAYING CARDS USING BLACK AS YES AND RED AS NUMBER

USE THE FACE CARDS AS CHARACTER CARDS
USE THE ACES TO MARK ROUND VICTORIES
USE THE NUMBER CARDS FOR MISSION VOTING AND AS SUCCESS FAIL CARDS
USE A JOKER AS A TEAM LEADER CARD
YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT MISSION SELECTION MARKERS
I SHOULD NOTE THAT I'VE ONLY PLAYED THE RESISTANCE ONCE OR TWICE MYSELF MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE REASONS MENTIONED ABOVE WHICH IS WHY I'M REALLY HOPING FOR SOME ADVICE WHICH HANDFUL OF CARDS ADD A TON OF REPLACEABILITY FUN WITHOUT MAKING THE GAME A LOT MORE COMPLEX
I'M THINKING OF MAYBE OR SO EXTRA ROLES WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE SOMETIMES TO KEEP THINGS INTERESTING
IF YOU'RE GONNA GET IT PRINTED AT PRINTER STUDIO OR ANOTHER PLACE AND GET IT ALL DONE LET ME KNOW WOULD LOVE A SMALLER VERSION AS WELL
YOU COULD SKIP THE SELECTED FOR MISSION CARDS AND JUST HAND EACH PLAYER A PAIR OF SUCCESS FAIL CARDS INSTEAD THAT GIVES YOU FIVE MORE CARDS FOR EXPANSION STUFF

IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO SAVE SPACE YOU COULD KEEP THE RULES ON YOUR PHONE SOMEWHERE AND REPLACE THE TEAM LEADER CARD WITH ANY OBJECT YOU HAVE HANDY LIKE THE BOX
THEY ARE TECHNICALLY TOYS WE SHOULD ALL ACKNOWLEDGE IT
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE THE AVERAGE PERSON LOOKING TO BUY AGRICOLA OR TERRA MYSTIC ISN'T LIKELY TO BE BUYING IT IN A STORY WITH DEPARTMENTS LIKE HOBBY AND TOYS KIDS
WHERE ARE YOU SHOPPING

I HAVEN'T FOUND A STORE THAT SELLS AGRICOLA THAT HAS DEPARTMENTS SECTIONS
SERIOUS BUSINESS
I'VE NEVER FOUND EITHER OF THOSE GAMES IN A LARGER STORE WHEN I HAVE FOUND ANYTHING CLOSE TO THAT THEY'VE MOST LIKELY BEEN IN A STRATEGY GAMES SECTION AND FAILING THAT AT THE VERY LEAST TOYS GAMES WHICH IS CORRECT
ANY OF THE MID WEIGHT EUROS AND EVEN HEAVIER ONES AT THE LOWER PLAYER COUNTS I GUESS HOW SIMPLE DO YOU WANT IT TO BE IS THE KEY QUESTION

FIRST RECOMMENDATION PROBABLY WOULD BE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY IT HAS WIDE RANGING APPEAL SIMPLE RULES AND STOOD THE TEST OF TIME BUT MAX IF YOU GO LIGHTER THEN I WOULD LOOK AT CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX BUT FAST PLAYING IS ROLL FOR THE GALAXY WHICH CAN SUPPORT KEYFLOWER SUPPORTS P IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED BUT CAN FINISH UNDER AT COUNT AT THE HEAVIER END YOU HAVE STEAM WHICH SUPPORTS MULTIPLE PLAYERS COUNTS IS NOT TOO COMPLEX RULES WISE AND CAN PLAY UNDER 2 HR FOR
CHECK OUT SPLENDOR GAMES ARE CLOSER TO A HALF HOUR BUT IT IS A FANTASTIC GAME THAT FALLS UNDER THE EASY TO TEACH AND HARD TO MASTER IT'S ALSO PLAYERS SO DOESN'T QUITE MEET THE PLAYER COUNT BUT IT'S SO EASY TO BRING TO THE TABLE AND USUALLY IS A HIT WITH GAMERS AND NON GAMERS ALIKE
INNOVATION SEEMS LIKE A GOOD FIT ONLY GOES UP TO FOUR THOUGH AND HONESTLY IT'S BEST AT TWO

ARCTIC SCAVENGERS IS A REALLY GOOD DECKBUILDER FOR THE BASIC STRATEGY IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND BUT IT'S COMPLICATED BY A SHOWDOWN EVERY ROUND AFTER THE BEGINNING

EVOLUTION GOES TO GETS A LITTLE MESSY AT HIGH COUNTS BUT IT WORKS WELL I'D RECOMMEND GETTING CLIMATE AS IT CONTAINS THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL GAME ALONG WITH SOME GREAT ADDITIONS
BLOOD RAGE IS AMAZING HOURS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND INCORPORATES ALMOST NO LUCK CARD DRAFTING KEEPS EACH GAME FRESH AND ALLOWS THE MANY VIABLE STRATEGIES TO DEVELOP ORGANICALLY BEAUTIFUL MINIS DO NOT HURT I'VE TAUGHT THIS GAME QUICKLY TO NON GAMERS AND GAMERS ALIKE
CONCORDIA
PUERTO RICO ONLY PLAYS UP TO BELFORT POWER GRID
SO MEATY GAMES TYPICALLY AREN'T VERY GOOD WITH OR PLAYERS

THE ONLY PLAYER GAME THAT I DON'T HATE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE FOREVER JUST HALF OF FOREVER THAT ALSO HAS A LITTLE BIT OF MEAT ON IT IS ALHAMBRA THE BIG BOX VERY REPAYABLE AND TAKES ONLY MINUTES BUT IF YOUR FRIENDS THINK WONDERS IS TOO RANDOM THEN ALHAMBRA MAY SUFFER THE SAME ASSESSMENT

I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT BE AFRAID TO SPLIT INTO TWO GROUPS IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY BOARDGAME NIGHT IS THAT WE ALL ENJOY THE NIGHT MUCH BETTER IF WE HAVE TWO GAMES OF THREE PLAYERS THAN ONE GAME OF SIX FOR STRATEGY GAMES THAT IS DOESN'T APPLY TO PARTY GAMES OF COURSE

IF YOU DROPPED THE PLAYER COUNT TO THEN THERE ARE MANY GAMES THAT I CAN LIST THAT ARE MUCH MORE THAN RANDOM INCIDENTALLY THEY ARE ALL FAVORITES FOR ME AS WELL

NINJATO IS JUST AN AMAZING VERY INTERESTING WORKER PLACEMENT GAME THAT ALSO LOOKS GREAT AND FOR ME REALLY EVOKES THE THEME WELL FOR A EURO I LOVE HOW ALL THE AREAS ARE DEFINITELY FEELS VERY HARD TO MASTER TO ME AS THERE ARE JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THINGS AND YOU COULD SPEND FOREVER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS OPTIMAL AND YET PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY GET TOO HUNG UP IN ANALYSIS PARALYSIS
CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG IS PROBABLY SIMILAR COMPLEXITY TO WONDERS BUT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY MORE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT OVERALL IT'S PRETTY INTUITIVE TO LEARN UNDERSTAND THE RULES BUT IT IS ALWAYS VERY INTERESTING TO BE THE MASTER BUILDER IT'S AN AUCTIONING GAME WHERE PEOPLE TAKE TURNS SETTING THE PRICES FOR THEIR OPPONENTS KEEPING IN MIND THAT THEIR OPPONENTS DON'T HAVE TO BUY ANYTHING BUT IF THEY DO THE MONEY GOES TO THE MASTER BUILDER
DOMINION TAKES A LONG TIME TO MASTER I'VE PLAYED THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN MY LIFE PLAYS AND I STILL DON'T ALWAYS WIN IT'S THE CLASSIC AND HAS BASICALLY INFINITE REPLACEABILITY SINCE YOU RANDOMLY DETERMINE WHAT THE MAIN CARDS WILL BE EVERY GAME
TRAINS IS LIKE DOMINION IN MANY WAYS BUT IT HAS A MAP AND IT'S ABOUT TRAINS LOVE THIS GAME JUST AS MUCH PROBABLY

CHECK OUT SYLVIAN IT'S A LITTLE TOWER DEFENSE GAME PLAYS IN UNDER AN HOUR YOUR CARDS ARE BOTH STUFF YOU CAN BUILD USE AND THE RESOURCES TO PAY FOR SAID STUFF THE ADVANCED GAME INCLUDES A DECK CONSTRUCTION BEFORE THE GAME PROPER WHICH IS A LOT OF FUN
FOR PLAYING SOLO I PREFER FRIDAY OUT OF THAT LIST AND I REALLY LIKE PLAYING ASCENSION AND THUNDERSTONE ADVANCE BEFORE I SOLD IT POSSIBLY BACKING THE KICKSTARTER NEXT YEAR SOLO HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR IS COOL BUT I FIND IT TOO DIFFICULT I DON'T HAVE MAGE KNIGHT BUT I HAVE STAR TREK FRONTIERS AND WHILE I LOVE IT I FIND IT DAUNTING TO PLAY AND SO IT DOESN'T GET OUT MUCH I REALLY DON'T ENJOY MARVEL LEGENDARY AND LE ALIEN IS TOO EASY SOLO SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE IS NOT REALLY MEANT FOR SOLO APART FROM ONE MISSION FOR CHARACTERS AND I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF HAVING TO MANAGE MULTIPLE DECKS TO PLAY A SOLO VERSION OF A GAME I'VE BOUGHT ATTACK ON TITAN BECAUSE IT LOOKS PRETTY FUN AND DIFFERENT
YOU COULD TRY IMPERIAL SETTLERS OR POSSIBLY EVEN GUILDS OF LONDON GOL DOES NOT INCLUDE SOLO RULES IN THE BOX BUT THE OFFICIAL RULES ARE LISTED ON BG BOTH OF THESE HAVE STRONG SOLO RULES IMPERIAL SETTLERS IS ALL ABOUT HAND MANAGEMENT AND GOL IS MORE OF A MIX BUT THE SOLO RULES ARE BRUTAL AND THE SETUP VARIES FROM GAME TO GAME
STAR REALMS GOT THE POTENTIAL FOR SOLO SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY THE APP OUT

MARKHAM CG IS THE NEXT ONE I AM EYEING HOPEFULLY I CAN GRAB A COPY SOON

PAPERBACK IS PRETTY GOOD AS A DECK BUILDER TOO AS YOU CAN TWEAK YOUR DECK TO THE WORDS YOU CAN THINK OF IT'S NOT RELIANT ON KNOWING A STRONG BASE OF VOCABULARY LIKE SCRABBLE

I HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT ALIENS LEGENDARY BUT I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF THE FRANCHISE

MISTFALL LOOKS TO BE A GOOD ADVENTURING GAME YOU CAN CHECK OUT RICK ROYAL YOUTUBE PLAY THROUGH FOR IT

FOR A COMPACT SOLO I ENJOYED FLIP CITY AND PAX
I PERSONALLY THINK LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS IS MUCH BETTER THAN MARVEL
CONSIDER BASEBALL HIGHLIGHTS IT'S AN EXCELLENT DECK BUILDER THAT PLAYS GREAT SOLO AND AT 2 PLAYER YOU DON'T NEED TO LIKE OR EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY BASEBALL TO ENJOY IT
THE CLASSIC SUGGESTION IS MAGE KNIGHT IT'S GOT DECKBUILDINGISH STUFF AND IT'S GOT EXTENSIVE SOLO PLAY GIVE IT SOME RESEARCH AND SEE IF IT APPEALS
IF YOU LIKE DINOSAURS THEN THE BEST DECKBUILDER FOR SOLO YOU CAN GET IS APEX THEROPOD IT'S CRAZY THEMATIC AND DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR SOLO PLAY THE GAME CONTAINS MANY DIFFERENT DINOSAURS TO CHOOSE FROM FOR YOUR PLAYER DECK AND DIFFERENT BOSSES TO FIGHT AGAINST ESSENTIALLY YOU HUNT OTHER DINOSAURS WHICH YOU CAN THEN USE TO BUY BETTER CARDS FOR YOUR DECK

THE GAME IS LIMITED TO ROUNDS DEPENDING ON YOUR CHOSEN DIFFICULTY AND YOU HAVE TO KILL THE BOSS BEFORE A HUGE ASTEROID HITS EARTH AND ALL DINOSAURS GO EXTINCT

MY FAVORITE HAND MANAGEMENT GAME IS RACE FORMULA TECHNICALLY IT'S NOT A SOLO GAME BUT WITH A FEW SMALL HOUSE RULES YOU GET A VERY TENSE AND THEMATIC SOLO EXPERIENCE BEWARE THAT THIS GAME IS A SIMULATION AND THEREFORE HAS MANY RULES AND NOT THE BEST RULEBOOK ONCE YOU GET OVER THAT INITIAL SPEED BUMP THE GAME PLAYS VERY QUICKLY
THUNDERSTONE ADVANCE
IF YOU LIKE WORD GAMES PAPERBACK IS A GOOD OPTION
MISTFALL HAS LIMITED DECKBUILDING BUT IS GREAT FOR HAND MANAGEMENT
MISTFALL HAS LIMITED DECKBUILDING BUT IS GREAT FOR HAND MANAGEMENT
THE SEWING ON THOSE STEEPLE PLUSHES LOOKS AWFUL THE DESIGNS ON THE TWO SHIRTS THAT AREN'T YOUR GAME ARE BLAND AND GENERIC
THEY USE THE SAME CORE C C COMMAND CARD MECHANIC MAP HAS THREE SECTIONS EACH COMMAND CARD IN YOUR HAND ORDERS SPECIFIC UNIT TYPES OR UNITS ON SPECIFIC SECTIONS REST OF IT IS VERY DIFFERENT

GIVES VICTORY POINTS BASED ON KILLS IS OBJECTIVE KING OF THE HILL BASED

HAS SET SCENARIOS WITH SET TROOPS HAS VARIABLE SCENARIO SETUP EACH SIDE HAS CARDS CONNECT TWO CARDS AND BOOM A SCENARIO WITH VARIABLE TROOPS MUSTER POINTS EACH UNIT HAS A SPECIFIC COST GO NUTS

HAS A SHARED LORE DECK HAS FACTION SPECIFIC LORE CARDS

THEMATICALLY IS MEDIEVAL HISTORIC WITH SOME GOBLINS AND DWARVES THROWN IN FEELS A BIT WEIRD AS A RESULT IS STRAIGHT UP GENERIC FFA FANTASY

THERE'S OTHER RANDOM BITS HERE AND THERE BUT THOSE ARE THE BIG ONES THAT SPRANG TO MIND I'D SAY IS A DECENT ENOUGH WAY TO TEST DRIVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'D SAY THAT ANY COMMANDS COLOURS GAME IS A DECENT WAY TO TEST DRIVE THE COMMANDS COLOURS SYSTEM
ONE BIG THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT MASSIVE DARKNESS IS MADE BY CMON WHO MAKES THESE KINDS OF GAMES ALL THE TIME VAMPIRE HUNTERS LOOKS LIKE THESE GUYS FIRST GAME THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN'T PULL IT OFF BUT THERE IS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE RISK INVOLVED WHO IS MAKING THEIR MINIS THEIR KICKSTARTER PAGE SEEMS TO JUST HAVE RENDERS THAT'S ANOTHER RED FLAG FOR ME

I WOULD AND DID GO WITH MASSIVE DARKNESS
FUNNY ENOUGH I WAS ACTUALLY RECENTLY DEBATING THIS AS WELL I ENDED UP BACKING LATE FOR MASSIVE DARKNESS BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS OVERALL LIKE THE MORE ENJOYABLE AND GAME BOTH LOOK GREAT AND I'M SURE EVENTUALLY I'LL HAVE BOTH BUT I PUT MY MONEY ON MASSIVE DARKNESS
CHINA WOULD BE PROUD OF THE AMOUNT OF RED FLAGS IN THE VAMPIRE HUNTERS KICKSTARTER S GO GET MASSIVE DARKNESS
MD WON'T HAVE ANY REVIEWS FOR QUITE A WHILE I AM A BACKER AND THE GAME IS BUILT ON TOP OF THE ZOMBICIDE GAMEPLAY BUT WITH ADDED DEPTH MD BRINGS IN SKILL TREES A DIFFERENT DICE COMBAT SYSTEM AND THE BEST LOOT IS EARNED FROM DEFEATING BOSSES I HAD LOOKED INTO V WHEN IT LAUNCHED ON KICKSTARTER BUT TO ME IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A CLONE OF ZOMBICIDE WITH NOT THAT MUCH DEPTH ADDED IN I DON'T THINK EITHER GAME WILL END UP BEING BAD SO I THINK WHAT EVERYTHING REALLY COMES DOWN TO IS THEME DO YOU WANT A FANTASY DUNGEON CRAWLER OR A VAMPIRE HUNTING GAME
CARCASSONNE DOMINION CITADELS CASTLES OF BURGUNDY BASICALLY ANY GAME ABOUT BUILDING A MEDIEVAL KINGDOM ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT PLAYED KINGDOM BUILDER

IT JUST SEEMS TO BE THE THEME OF QUALITY AND STABILITY
COSMIC ENCOUNTER

JAIPUR

HEROSCAPE

GO

PRINCES OF FLORENCE

PUERTO RICO

SAMURAI

SEKIGAHARA

TWILIGHT IMPERIUM

ALL GAMES THAT STILL HIT THE TABLE WITH SOME REGULARITY I THINK IF A GAME HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEPTH IN RELATION TO THE PLAYTIME AND COMPLEXITY AS WELL AS HAVING A LEVEL OF ELEGANCE AND FOCUS IN DESIGN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL HOLD UP FOR A LONG TIME

DISCLAIMER THERE ARE A LOT OF OLDER GAMES I HAVE YET TO PLAY
CARCASSONNE AND AGRICOLA

2 GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN IN MY COLLECTION FOR A LONG TIME AND BOTH STILL PLAYED REGULARLY
THESE GAMES WILL BE IN MY COLLECTION FOREVER

PANDEMIC
GHOST STORIES
WONDERS
RACE FOR THE GALAXY
STONE AGE
RACE FOR THE GALAXY
AGRICOLA
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A HUGE FAN OF SAMURAI SWORDS AND AXIS ALLIES THERE IS A REASON THEY ARE STILL IN PRINTING

ALSO BATTLETECH HAS BEEN AROUND FOR FOREVER AND THE BASIC SYSTEM IS THE EXACT SAME THAT IS FOR A REASON IT IS REALLY GOOD
I STILL PLAY ACQUIRE PRETTY REGULARLY AND IT WAS PUBLISHED WHEN JFK WAS PRESIDENT I PLAY A FAIR AMOUNT OF TITAN TOO AND THAT'S FROM
EL GRANDE PUERTO RICO EUPHRATES AND TIGRIS COME TO MIND
DOMINION HUNDREDS OF PLAYS LATER STILL LOVE IT I'VE PLAYED MANY OTHER DECKBUILDERS AND THIS CLASSIC IS ACTUALLY STILL MY FAVORITE ALTHOUGH TRAINS MIGHT DERAIL IT
ALHAMBRA IS STILL A STAPLE GAME FOR ME REPLACEABILITY WITH THE BIG BOX IS THROUGH THE ROOF
GO THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD AND STILL ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME IMO THIS IS ONE OF TWO GAMES THE OTHER IS DOMINION WHERE I HAVE READ TONS OF STRATEGY ARTICLES ABOUT IT AND PARTICIPATED IN THE META TO SOME DEGREE

THOUGH I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT MENTIONED AT LEAST TWICE HERE I'VE PROBABLY PLAYED GO AS MANY TIMES AS ALL OTHER GAMES COMBINED
HOW ABOUT YEARS OLD EXPANSION FOR A MUCH OLDER GAME

SETTLERS OF CATAN EXPLORERS AND PIRATES EXPANSION

IT TURNS CATAN INTO A RACING GAME WITH VERY LITTLE TRADING LESS ABOUT THE CARDS THOUGH THEY CERTAINLY HELP GET THE RACE STARTED BUT IT'S STILL A FUN MEDIUM WEIGHT GAME THAT GETS CATAN ON THE BOARD WITHOUT THE FOURTH PLAYER FEELING USELESS

I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WIN WITH PIRATES AND SPICE FISH AND HARBORS OR A LITTLE OF EACH
THE BG FORUMS ARE BY FAR THE BEST PLACE TO CHECK RULES AND NO IN THE PROLOGUE YOU DON'T GET ANY OF THE END GAME REWARDS BELIEVE IT DOES CLARIFY THIS IN THE RULEBOOK WHERE IT EXPLAINS END GAME
THE WELCOME SHEET TELLS YOU POINT BLANK THERE ARE NO END GAME REWARDS AT THE END OF THE PROLOGUE I'D READ THAT AGAIN
NO THE ONLY PERMANENT CHANGES THAT YOU MAKE DURING THE PROLOGUE ARE NAMING THE ISLANDS THE RESULTS OF EXPLORATION AND ANYTHING THAT THE BLOKE EXPLICITLY TELLS YOU TO DO WHEN YOU COMPLETE A MILESTONE

WE FOUND ONE OF THE INSTRUCTIONS AT THE END OF THE PROLOGUE CONFUSING SO HERE'S A HINT SPOILER S ONLY DO THINGS TO COMPONENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED IN THE GAME
I HAVEN'T READ INTO THE BLOKE YET

AND YOU NEVER SHOULD UNLESS THE GAME TELLS YOU TO JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT IN CASE YOU DECIDED TO CRACK IT OPEN AFTER FINISHING THE RULEBOOK
OBLIGATORY THIS IS FROM JUL BUT HAS JUST BEEN UPLOADED TO YOUTUBE COMMENT
I OWN THIS GAME AND ALL EXPANSIONS WELL WORTH IT THERE IS SO MUCH REPLACEABILITY DUE TO ARMY CREATION AND THE WAY THE SCENARIOS WORK IT'S GREAT FUN IT'S A SHAME THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE AREN'T ANYMORE EXPANSIONS COMING OUT BUT I'D STILL RECOMMEND IT THERE IS STILL A CRAP TON OF CONTENT AND GAME PLAY WITH WHAT IS OUT THERE CURRENTLY
HOW LONG UNTIL MUSD RUN OUT OF OLD VIDEOS
LOVE THIS GAME
HILARIOUS TIMING ON THIS REUPLOAD
GO ON EBAY AND GET YARD OF NEOPRENE SHOULD BE ABOUT ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE MAGIC MATS WILL COVER YOUR WHOLE TABLE AND IS A GREAT SURFACE IT'S WHAT I USED FOR MY GAME TABLE
YOU HAVE ANY CRAFT STORES NEARBY THAT SELL FABRIC HOBBY LOBBY OR EVEN WALMART WILL PROBABLY HAVE ALL KINDS OF VINYL AND FELT YOU CAN BUY BY THE YARD AND CUT DOWN TO FIT YOUR TABLE
IT'S A BIT PRICEY BUT I LOVE THIS QUIVER GAMING MAT HETP
I GOT IN ON A GROUP ORDER OF THIS AND CUT IT TO MY TABLE LENGTH WORKS GREAT

PRODUCT X MAKES FT
IF YOU WANT A GOOD QUALITY SOLUTION FOR UNDER THEN I THINK YOUR BEST BET IS A ROLL UP POKER MAT

PILL SHAPED FOR RECTANGULAR TABLES
CIRCULAR

THEY FEEL LIKE A GIANT MOUSE PAD IT'S STANDARD NEOPRENE

BEFORE I GOT MY GAMING TABLE I USED BOTH OF THESE ON THE DIFFERENT TABLES I HAVE ON MY GAME NIGHTS THEY WORK EXCELLENTLY COME IN VARIOUS COLORS AND ARE MUCH CHEAPER THAN MOST HOBBY GAME MATS

SOME OF THE PRICES FOR HOBBY GAME MATS IS INSANE
MY PERSONAL BUDGET SOLUTION IS BAIZE IT'S SNOOKER TABLE CLOTH AND PRETTY CHEAP MORE SO THAN A CARD TABLE CLOTH I HAVE A BY 2 METRE THAT I TAKE WITH ME TO GAMING CLUBS BUT IT GETS FLUFFY AND ISN'T REALLY MACHINE WASHABLE
I USE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO VELVET LIKE THE OFFSPRING OF VELVET AND POLAR FLEECE FROM THE LOCAL FABRIC STORE BUT CHEAPER I WON'T PLAY WITHOUT IT

I ALSO USE PICNIC TABLE CLIPS UNDER THE TABLE TO HOLD IT SNUG
RECENTLY I WENT TO A FABRIC STORE AND GOT A LARGE PIECE OF FELT FOR MY TABLE WORKS GREAT FOR GAMES OF ANY TYPE A SMALL HIT ON THE WALLET AND GREAT VALUE
THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPANIES THAT MAKE LARGE WARGAMING MATS MADE OF SIMILAR MATERIALS THESE ARE USUALLY FAIRLY REGULAR IN SIZE IN FEET OR OR BEING COMMON ONE EXAMPLE IS

I PERSONALLY JUST BOUGHT A LARGE SHEET OF NEOPRENE FROM HETP AND CUT IT TO FIT MY TABLE EXACTLY
SHOULD CHECK OUT YOGA MATS THEY ARE REALLY DURABLE AND FAIRLY CHEAP THIS IS THE ONE I USE IT'S EXTRA WIDE AND LONG SO IT FITS MY TABLE PERFECTLY MY TABLE IS A BIT NARROW AND REALLY LONG SO IT MIGHT NOT FIT NORMAL TABLES BUT CHECK OUT THE DIMENSIONS

GP PRODUCT REF IE DTF PSC

FORGIVE MY LACK OF FORMATTING SINCE I'M ON MOBILE BUT TARGET HAS SOMETHING CALLED A COMFORT KITCHEN MAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ON SALE RIGHT NOW AND MOST STORES WILL HAVE IT FOR PICKUP IT'S AND YOU CAN DOUBLE UP AND GO SIDE-BY-SIDE IF YOU NEED TO IT'S NOT EXACTLY LIKE A MOUSEPAD BUT IT'S A THICK FOAM LIKE A YOGA OR GYMNASTIC MAT AND THE TOP IS LIKE A LINEN

P A

I HAVE TWO FOR MY TABLE AT HOME AND THEY WORK GREAT

SO AN UPDATE MINOR SPOILERS

WE'RE PLAYING HEIRS OF BLOOD
THE OL HAS SOME KIND OF VAMPIRE LIEUTENANT
OUR PARTY
LANDEL TREASURE HUNTER ME
ELDER MOK PROPHET
HIGH MAGE QUELLED RUNEMASTER
REINHART THE WORTHY CHAMPION

WE SET UP AND PLAYED THROUGH THE FIRST MISSION THE OL COMPLETED HIS TASK BEFORE US AND WE LEFT WITH GOLD NOT BAD FOR A FIRST GO ACCORDING TO THE OL
WE STRUGGLED STAYING FOCUSED ON THE MISSION AND ALTHOUGH WE FELT WE HAD A GOOD STRATEGY FOR EACH OF OUR TURNS WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE AN OVERRIDING STRATEGY FOR THE MISSION WE KNOW THAT NOW
WE WERE MISSING SOMEONE WITH A GOOD RANGER WEAPON SO ALL OUR COMBAT WAS CLOSE QUARTERS
ALL IN ALL A FUN NIGHT LEARNED A TON AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT MISSION
THE OL HAS GIVEN US ALL THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE CLASSES AT THIS STAGE IF WE FEEL SO INCLINED WE'LL GO SHOPPING AT THE START OF THE NEXT MISSION WE ALL HAVE EXPERIENCE TO SPEND TOO
THAT'S IT FOR NOW THANKS AGAIN FOR GETTING ME PREPPED

OBLIGATORY PATCHWORK SUGGESTION
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU JUMPED INTO THE MEDIUM TO HEAVY GAMES BEFORE YOU TRIED THE STANDARD INTRODUCTORY GAMES LIKE TICKET TO RIDE CARCASSONNE CATAN AND SUSHI GO IF NEED BE GO ON BOARDGAMEGEEK AND LOOK FOR TWO PLAYER VARIANTS START HER OFF SLOW AND ALLOW HER TO FIND HER GROOVE I PLAY GAMES WITH MY WIFE AND SOME OF THEM SHE LIKES AND OTHERS SHE DOESN'T BUT TOGETHER WHEN SHE IS HAVING FUN I AM HAVING FUN
WHAT GAMES HAVE YOU TRIED WITH HER SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE RUINED HER GOODWILL WITH THEM JUST BECAUSE YOU ONLY TRY HEAVY THINGS WITH HERALDRY IF YOU PLAYED LIGHT GAMES WITH HER SHE'D PROBABLY LIKE THEM
MY WIFE ALSO DOESN'T LIKE ANYTHING LONG OR COMPLICATED BUT SHE REALLY ENJOYED LORDS OF WATERDEEP HAS FANTASY THEME AND LET'S HER WORK ON HER OWN QUESTS WITH VERY LITTLE DIRECT COMPETITION

RIGHT NOW SHE LIKES CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG AND SHE'S ALWAYS ENJOYED COOP GAMES LIKE PANDEMIC AND CONSULTING DETECTIVE
MY WIFE ISNT A GAMER SHE DOESNT LIKE HEAVY GAMES OR EVE MEDIUM WEIGHT GAMES WITH THE ODD EXCEPTING OF POWERGRID

TRY SPLENDOR OR LORDS OF WATERDEEP MY WIFE LOVES THOSE TWO AND THEY BOTH FIT YOUR TUME REQUIREMENT
CARCASSONNE JAIPUR BATTLEPLANE WONDERS DUEL MARGI AKROTIRI SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS OR PANDEMIC
I AM GOING TO SUGGEST MYSTERIUM

IT IS A CO-OPERATIVE GAME THAT I THINK REALLY DEFIES WHAT A BOARD GAME TYPICALLY IS IT IS A GAME LIKE CLUE BUT INSTEAD OF BEING DEDUCTION BASED ONE PLAYER IS A GHOST THAT KNOWS THE MURDERER AND MUST TELL THE PLAYERS THROUGH SHOWING THEM ART DEICES IN 2 PLAYER MODE IT REALLY BECOMES A GAME ABOUT COMMUNICATION THE GUESSER NEEDS TO BE VERY VOCAL ABOUT THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS AND HAS NOBODY TO ELSE RELY UPON AND THE GHOST NEEDS TO TRY AND GET INSIDE THE HEAD THE ART IS REALLY INCREDIBLY STUNNING AS WELL

U GETINFO
I HAVE TO SUGGEST TAKENOKO CARCASSONNE AND PAPERBACK IF SHE IS A READER

ALSO MOST ANY CO-OP GAME WORK TOGETHER AND DON'T PLAY JUST TO WIN

ALSO MY WIFE IS NOT A GAMER JUST GETTING SOME GAMES SHE ENJOYED WE NOW GET TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER THAT ISN'T SITTING AND READING OUR SCREENS

IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LOVE THE GAMES JUST BEING ABLE TO SHARE A SLIVER OF GAMING WITH HER WAS GREAT FOR ME
WHAT THEMES DOES SHE LIKE
DESCRIBE YOUR GROUP

DESCRIBE WHAT GAMES YOU HAVE ALREADY

DESCRIBE WHAT TYPE OF GAME YOUR GROUP HATES LOVES

ETC
THIS THREAD SHOULD PROVIDE YOU WITH A GOOD MIX IN INSPIRATION FOR GAMES IN THAT PRICE BRACKET THOUGH NOTE THAT IS FOR USD GAMES NOT GAMES STILL SOME OF THE GAMES LISTED THERE ARE WITH HEAVY ONLINE RETAILER DISCOUNTS

BUT REALLY AS RAKING SAYS IT DEPENDS ON YOUR GROUP WHAT YOU LIKE AND DISLIKE VERY FEW GAMES WORK WELL FOR EVERYONE
WASN'T SURE HOW TO PRICE THEM FROM THE STATES BUT AMAZON HAS SOME THAT ARE WORTH IT FOR THAT RANGE

FIRST REC

SECOND REC

THIRD REC
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR GROUP PERSONAL FAVORITES OF MINE THAT FALL INTO A LOWER PRICE BRACKER INCLUDE ISLE OF SKYE CARCASSONNE RACE FOR THE GALAXY GLASS ROAD CASTLES OF BURGUNDY FLEET LEWIS AND CLARK POWER GRID AND SMASH UP
RACE FOR THE GALAXY IS OUR FAVORITE GAME IN THAT PRICE BRACKET IT'S LIKE AND I THINK TONS OF DEPTH AND REPLACEABILITY ONCE YOU LEARN THE DOZEN OR SO SYMBOLS THAT ARE USED IN THE GAME
I HATE THE FORMER AND AT LEAST REALLY LIKE THE LATTER SO GET GREAT WESTERN TRAIL

AND ITS ONLY ESSENTIAL TO GET AT LEAST SIX PLAYERS FOR CAPTAIN SONAR BUT THERE'LL BE NO SPOT FOR THE PERSON THAT WANTS LITTLE TO DO WHEN A TEAM HAS ONLY THREE PLAYERS
GREAT WESTERN TRAIL ARRIVED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND WE ALREADY HAVE PLAYS IN IT'S MY SECOND RATED GAME ON BG THE VARIOUS MECHANICS INTEGRATE ELEGANTLY AND WHILE THERE ARE MANY FACTORS TO CONSIDER EACH TURN PLAYS RATHER QUICK

I HAVEN'T PLAYED OR WANTED TO PLAY THE OTHER GAMES LISTED
KEYFLOWER
I WOULD RECOMMEND BWT OVER CRY HAVOC WHICH I FOUND INFERIOR TO BLOOD RAGE EMET SIMILAR AREA CONTROL GAMES
DECK BUILDERS JUST DON'T WORK THAT WE'LL WITH LARGE GROUPS BECAUSE TURNS TAKE TOO LONG AND THERE IS LITTLE TO DO WHILE IT ISN'T YOUR TURN

MAYBE A CARD DRAFTING GAME LIKE WONDERS OR SUSHI GO
I'VE NEVER HEARD KERFED USED IN THAT WAY IN VIDEO GAMING IT MEANS TO TAKE SOMETHING AND MAKE IT LESS POWERFUL OFTEN IN REFERENCE TO WEAPONS BASICALLY THEY TAKE A SUPER POWERFUL WEAPON AWAY FROM YOU AND REPLACE IT WITH A CERF VERSION OF THAT WEAPON

AS FOR YOUR ACTUAL QUESTION I'VE NOT PLAYED A DECK BUILDER THAT I LIKED AT MORE THAN PLAYERS THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH DOWNTIME I THINK YOU WOULD BE BETTER SERVED LOOKING INTO DRAFTING GAMES OR SPLITTING INTO 2 GAMES
I'D RECOMMEND PLAYING TWO GROUPS OF THREE OR ANOTHER GAME OTHER THAN A DECKBUILDER FOR MOST GAMES ARE GOOD WITH SOME ARE GOOD AT THE ONES THAT ARE GOOD AT ARE TYPICALLY UNICORNS OR PARTY GAMES

THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE TIME BETWEEN TURNS WITH A LOT OF PLAYERS THERE'S A LOT OF TIME BETWEEN ACTIONS AND PLAYERS GET BORED
IF YOUR GROUP DOESN'T MIND THE DOWNTIME OF PLAYING A LARGER PLAYER COUNT DECK BUILDER MY GROUP WHO IS THIS WAY HAS ENJOYED ASCENSION AND VALLEY OF THE KINGS IN BOTH CASES YOU WILL NEED TWO BASE SETS OF THE GAME OR AT LEAST A BASE SET AND EXPANSION FOR ASCENSION

FOR ASCENSION I LIKE HOW REALMS UNRAVELED AND DAWN OF CHAMPIONS MIX

FOR VALLEY OF THE KINGS YOU'D WANT THE ORIGINAL ONE AND AFTERLIFE SINCE LAST RITES HAS SOME DIFFERENT STARTING CARDS IN IT
APEX THEROPOD IS A FUN DECKBUILDER AND IT PLAYS UP TO SIX BIG BOOK OF MADNESS PLAYS UP TO FIVE
BUY 2 COPIES OF BASEBALL HIGHLIGHTS AND PLAY AN PERSON TOURNAMENT
I MADE AN MTG CUBE OF COMMONS FOR CHEAP IT PLAYS THAT MANY FIRST YOU DRAFT ALL THE CARDS THEN YOU PLAY A ROUND ROBIN TOURNAMENT
AND HERE IVE BEEN USING CERF WRONG ALL ALONG MY BAD THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW THATS WHAT I GET FOR TRYING TO SOUND ALL KNOWLEDGEABLE AND DOWNTIME DOESNT MATTER TOO MUCH TO US WEVE LEARNED TO BE PATIENT HAVE HAD MANY TIMES PLAYING WITH OTHERS THAT TAKE YEARS FOR THEIR TURN
THEOMACHY IS OF A DECK BUILDING GAME THAT YOU MIGHT LIKE THEN IT IS ESSENTIALLY POKER BUT YOU PLAY AS GODS BIDDING YOUR WORSHIPPERS JUST MAKE SURE TO PLAY THE MODE
I HAVE A YEAR-OLD BOY AND A YEAR-OLD GIRL AND YOUR KIDS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE ONE GAME I CAN ALWAYS GET THEM TO PLAY WITH ME IS BONANZA THEY LOVE THE TRADING IT SOMETIMES LEADS TO ARGUMENTS BUT NOT ALWAYS AND IT'S SIMPLE AND QUICK ENOUGH FOR US ALL TO PLAY THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THERE'S NO DECENT VERSION WE PLAY THE HELL OUT OF IT HERE THOUGH
I THINK THEY MIGHT BE READY FOR PANDEMIC THIS CO-OP GAME WILL TEACH THEM TO STRATEGIZE AND WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM WIDELY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST BOARD GAMES EVER MADE

GOOD DEAL ON AMAZON AT THE MOMENT

PANDEMIC BOARD GAME
CODENAMES OF ANY VARIETY IS A BIT MPH FOR TWO

I'D RECOMMEND SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS IT WILL GET ALL THEIR SIBLING FRUSTRATIONS OUT IN THE BOARDGAME
WHAT ABOUT FORBIDDEN ISLAND OR FORBIDDEN DESERT I DO NOT THINK THEY COST MUCH AND ARE COOPERATIVE
I ALSO HAVE TRURO AT THE SCHOOL I WORK AT AND MY STUDENTS ENJOY THAT ONE
HUGE FYI HERE THIS GUY IS IN HUNGARY NOT THE US SO THE MAY NOT BE RELEVANT AS GAMES ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THERE
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HUNGARIAN PRICES BUT TAKE A LOOK AT INDIGO BY REINER KNIAZI IT IS MADE IN CZECH REPUBLIC SO IS PROBABLY NOT TOO EXPENSIVE WITH SHIPPING ETC BASICALLY IT'S A STRATEGY GAME ABOUT DRAWING A PATH USING RANDOM TILES TRYING TO GET STONES FROM THE CENTER OF THE BOARD TO YOUR GOAL IN ORDER TO SCORE THEM IT IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GAME WITH BYZANTINE INSPIRED ARTICLE

U GETINFO
BONANZA
SUSHI GO PARTY
DIMMET
THOSE THREE ARE CHEAP AND OFFER A LOT OF REPLACEABILITY THEY ARE FOR ALL AGES SO YOUR KIDS CAN STILL PLAY THEM MANY YEARS LATER
KING OF TOKYO WE JUST PICKED IT UP AND HAVE BEEN PLAYING IT WITH OUR GIRL AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING A BLAST

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUN AS WELL IT TOOK A COUPLE GAMES BEFORE SHE FULLY GOT IT THOUGH AND THE ROLE-PLAYING AS THE SHERIFF CAN BE A LOT OF FUN FOR CHILDREN AROUND THOSE AGES
DIXIE DOESN'T WORK WITH TWO PLAYERS BUT MYSTERIUM DOES


TAKENOKO

ESCAPE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE

RHINO HEROES

SUPER RHINO RHINO HEROES IS A FUN REVERSE JENA UNO THING KIDS LOVE BUILDING IT AND KNOCKING IT OVER

I THINK LOONY QUEST IS GREAT FOR EVERYONE AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF THE KIDS ARE INTO ANY SORT OF VIDEO GAMES
KING OF TOKYO

TRURO

BLOCKUS
CHECK OUT DEATH ANGEL IF THEY'RE UP FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DARKER CHEAP FUN GREAT FOR TWO AND IT EXPANDS WELL

AND THERE'S ALWAYS CATAN IF YOU CAN FIND A SALE AND YOUR FAMILY HASN'T PLAYED IT TO DEATH YET
I LOVE THAT WE'VE GOTTEN TO A POINT WHERE A SENTENCE POST NEEDS A TL ROYAL
I CAN'T HELP ON THE BOARD GAME FRONT THOUGH SOMETHING THEMED ON DICTATORSHIPS MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING INTERESTING THERE IS A GAME ON STEAM CALLED THE WESTPORT INDEPENDENT WHICH WHILE NOT TERRIBLY WELL REVIEWED IS A GAME ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING IT MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING AT JUST FOR IDEAS ON HOW YOU MIGHT BRING THAT IDEA TO THE TABLETOP
PENNY PRESS I GUESS HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT I KNOW IT'S ABOUT RUNNING A NEWSPAPER
EXTRA EXTRA BY MAYFAIR GAMES DEALS WITH PUBLISHING A NEWSPAPER BUT I AM NOT SURE IT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE GAME THEN MAKE IT
FIRST OF ALL THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAMES NOTHING ALIKE EXCEPT FOR BOX SIZE SECOND I NEVER PLAYED TINY EPIC DEFENDERS SO I WILL SKIP IT

TINY EPIC KINGDOMS IS A ISH WHERE PLAYERS HAVE A SINGLE ACTION POOL TO SHARE AND EACH PLAYER SELECTS ONE AND THE OTHER MAY FOLLOW KINDA LIKE PUERTO RICO THOUGH ALL PLAYERS PERFORM EQUALLY ITS PRETTY FUN AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME I LIKE IT NEVER PLAYED THE EXPANSION THOUGH

TINY EPIC GALAXIES IS A DICE BASED GAME WHERE PLAYERS HAVE TO MANAGE ACTIONS ACCORDING TO THE DICE ROLLED TO EXPAND THEIR EMPIRES BY COLLECTING RESOURCES UPGRADING THEIR BASE AND CONQUERING PLANETS IT HAD A SIMILAR FOLLOW MECHANIC THOUGH NOW PLAYERS HAVE TO PAY TO DO IT IT'S A VERY SHARP GAME A BIT FIDDLY BUT VERY VERY GOOD THE EXPANSION BEYOND THE BLACK I WOULD SAY IT'S A MUST HAVE BUT IT DOES GIVE A BIT OF VARIETY TO THE BASE GAME

FINALLY TINY EPIC WESTERN IS A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME MIXED WITH POKER SORT OF YOU GET THE BENEFITS OF WHERE YOU PLACE YOUR STEEPLE BUT YOU'RE ALSO IN TO WIN MORE STUFF IF YOU HAVE THE BETTER CARD POKER HAND SO FAR IT'S MY FAVORITE IT WORKS BEST WITH BIGGER COUNTS BECAUSE IT'S HARDER TO JUST KEEP IT TO YOURSELF AND THIS GAME IS AT ITS BEST WHEN IT'S COMPETITIVE ALSO BULLET DICE NEED I SAY MORE
UNVOTE FOR THE TITLE
TE KINGDOMS FIRST ONE QUITE GOOD LITTLE GAME BETTER WITH HEROES CALL EXPANSION SOME OF THE FACTIONS ARE DEFINITELY MORE POWERFUL THAN OTHERS THOUGH ALSO HAS AN ULTRA TINY VERSION WHICH IS GREAT FOR PORTABILITY BUT DOESN'T HAVE THE EXPANSION

TE DEFENDERS PROBABLY THE WEAKEST OF THE SERIES IT'S KIND OF A CASTLE DEFENSE GAME BUT WITH RANDOM TURN ORDER AND INCREASING PRESSURE FROM ENEMIES IT'S NOT BAD BUT NOT MY FAVORITE IT JUST FEELS LIKE A LOT OF LUCK IS INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE RANDOM TURN ORDER MECHANISM

TE GALAXIES FANTASTIC DICE CHUCKER KIND OF LIKE A MORE STREAMLINED VERSION OF ROLL FOR THE GALAXY PLAYS REALLY WELL SOLO AND VERY QUICK EASILY MY FAVORITE SO FAR AND HAS AN EXPANSION COMING OUT VERY SOON THAT SEEMS TO ADD A LOT MORE CONTENT AND OPTIONS

TE WESTERN MOST COMPLEX OF THE SERIES A SMASHUP OF CARD POKER AND WORKER PLACEMENT IT'S QUITE INTERESTING BUT SEEMS PRETTY FIDDLY GOOD THEME BUT A BIT ABSTRACT WITH SOME RULES FEELING SOMEWHAT FORCED IN MY OPINION

TE QUEST OBVIOUSLY THE NEW ONE AND AN FOR ME NOT MUCH MORE TO TELL YOU THEN WHAT THE KS SAYS

I OWN AND ENJOY THEM ALL BUT TEG IS MY FAVORITE I'VE PROBABLY PLAYED IT MOST WITH TEK A CLOSE SECOND THEY ADDED AN OFFICIAL SOLO MODE TO TEK WITH THE EXPANSION AND INSIDE THE ULTRA TINY VERSION THAT IS QUITE CHALLENGING BUT STRAIGHTFORWARD AND FUN I'M ADDICTED TO THE TINY EPIC SERIES MYSELF BUT I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND TEG AND TEK WITH EXPANSIONS THEN ALSO TINY EPIC QUESTS BUT THAT'S BASICALLY JUST A HUNCH

ALL HAVE FALLEN FLAT WITH ME AND MY GROUP IT FEELS LIKE ALL OF THE GAMES COULD BE REALLY GOOD BUT THEY'VE SACRIFICED THE TO BE TINY TEGALAXIES IS THE ONLY ONE WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT GETTING TO THE TABLE BUT THAT'S SUPER RARE I LOVE THE IDEA OF BEQUEST BUT AM AFRAID CERTAIN THAT I WILL COME AWAY FROM IT WITH A LACKLUSTER EXPERIENCE AGAIN
I JUST GOT TINY EPIC WESTERN AND I LOVE IT THE RULES AREN'T ENTIRELY THOUGHT OUT SO THERE ARE A TON OF QUESTIONS ERRATA THAT COME UP BUT OTHERWISE IT'S A REALLY FUN TAKE ON TEXAS THAT MAY INTRIGUE A MIXED GROUP OF BEGINNER GAMERS AND HARDCORE ALIKE
TINY EPIC WESTERN IS GOOD THAT SAID ALTHOUGH THE BOX ITSELF IS SMALL ISH THE GAME ITSELF IS FAIRLY DECENT SIZE
I AM MADLY IN LOVE WITH TINY EPIC GALAXIES JUST A WONDERFUL GAME ESPECIALLY AS A SOLO EXPERIENCE

HOWEVER IT'S THE ONLY TINY EPIC I'VE PLAYED
TINY EPIC GALAXIES IS MY FAVORITE TE GAME SO FAR A LOT OF COOL COMPONENTS A COMPLEX BUT EASY TO LEARN SET OF RULES EXCELLENT COMPETITIVE MECHANICS AND VERY FUN TO PLAY EVEN THE SOLITAIRE VERSION

I THINK IT'S A MUST IN THE SAGA
GALAXIES IS MY FAVOURITE FULL DICE CHUCKING SPACE GAMES

WESTERN IS FIDDLY AND MORE COMPLEX BUT ANOTHER HIT WITH ME AND MY GROUP

I HAVE FOUND THAT THE TINY EPIC SERIES HAS BEEN STELLAR AND I BACKED QUEST DAY ONE WITH NO HESITATION
I HAVE THEM ALL BUT OF THE RELEASED ONES I LOVE GALAXIES AND WESTERN THE MOST
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD THE OTHER GAMES ARE ALL PRETTY GOOD I'VE HEARD ESPECIALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT GALAXIES THE MAIN COMPLAINT MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE IS THAT THERE IS REALLY NO POINT TO THEM BEING TINY IF YOU CAN GET PAST THE UNNECESSARY GIMMICK I THINK YOU'LL BE HAPPY WITH THEM
HONESTLY THEY'RE PRETTY MEDIOCRE TED IS A SERVICEABLE CO-OP BUT THERE ARE BETTER COMPETITORS AT SIMILAR PRICE POINTS TEK IS QUITE BAD WITHOUT THE EXPANSION WITH IT IT BECOMES A PLAYABLE DISTILLATION OF MECHANICS BUT AGAIN SURPASSED BY GAMES LIKE IMPULSE OR POCKET IMPERIUM BY A WIDE MARGIN TEW I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR BUT AFTER ONE PLAY I HAVE PUT IT ON MY SELL PILE I THINK IT'S THE WORST OF THE LOT IT TAKES TOO LONG AND IS WAY TOO COMPLEX FOR THE GAMEPLAY YOU GET OUT OF IT THE POKER MECHANISM IS KIND OF COOL BUT THE REST OF THE GAME IS A SLOG

TEG IS THE ONLY ONE I'LL BE HAPPY TO PLAY BUT AGAIN THERE ARE BETTER GAMES OUT THERE IT'S A DICE GAME WITH SOME INTERESTING STUFF GOING ON AND IT ALSO PLAYS WELL SOLO THAT SAID I'M AMBIVALENT ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO HAVE NOT BACKED THE RECENT EXPANSION ON KS LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE TE GAMES IT'S ONLY TINY IN BOX SIZE AND OVERSTAYS IT'S WELCOME I WANT THESE GAMES TO PLAY IN MINUTES AND THEY ALMOST ALWAYS RUN CLOSER TO AT WHICH POINT I HAVE MANY OTHER GAMES I'D RATHER PLAY

QUEST LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE PRETTY GOOD BUT I DON'T LIKE HOW YOU HAVE A WHOLE MAP FULL OF UNIQUE CARDS EFFECTS THAT YOU HAVE TO READ BEFORE STARTING SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL INDUCE AP AND ONCE AGAIN GO LONGER THAN IT SHOULD THE ITEM MEEDLESS ARE COOL THOUGH MIGHT BE WORTH BACKING AT JUST TO PUT THEM IN OTHER GAMES
OF WHAT I OWN PAX PORFIRIANA FOR ME THERE ARE A FEW CHITS WHICH ARE JUST COUNTERS BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT IT'S JUST SETTING UP A BIG DECK OF CARDS
SEKIGAHARA AND POLIS FIGHT FOR THE HEGEMONY ARE TWO EXCELLENT 2 PLAYER GAMES WITH LITTLE SET UP
MOTTAINAI JUST A DECK OF CARDS AND A SMALL USER GUIDE MAT

AS FOR BEING HEAVY LEARNING CURVE IS A BIT HIGH AND THERE'S A LOT OF DECISION MAKING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE NEEDED TO GET A GREAT ENGINE RUNNING IN MY OPINION
WELL DIPLOMACY FOR SURE BUT LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT

TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES IS BASICALLY A BUNCH OF TILES AND A MAJORITY OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE IN A BAG FOR MOST OF THE GAME

AND JUST BECAUSE I CAN I'M GOING TO SAY WALLENSTEIN AND SHOGUN YES THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF FIDDLY BITS BUT YOU GET TO TAKE THEM AND DUMP THEM INTO A TOWER WHICH IS REALLY FUN AND IT'S NOT CONSIDERED FIDDLY IF YOU'RE HAVING FUN WITH THEM RIGHT RIGHT
ARBORETUM
NOT MAGE KNIGHT THAT'S FOR SURE
I'D SAY TWILIGHT STRUGGLE IS UP THERE NOT TOO MANY COMPONENTS RELATIVELY QUICK SETUP VERY DEEP AND QUITE A LENGTHY GAME
NO LOVE FOR TOWN CENTER

I'M ACTUALLY A BIT SURPRISED WHEN I FIRST SEE A WEIGHT ON BG FOR THIS PLAYING THIS A COUPLE MORE TIMES MAKES ME REALIZE THIS GAME IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS IT LOOKS
ORA ET LABARA DEFINITELY A BRAIN BURNER WITH A LOT OF STRATEGY AND STUFF GOING ON BUT NOT A TON OF FIDDLY MECHANICS SINCE THE RESOURCE WHEEL TAKES CARE OF IT ALL THERE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES TO COLLECT BUT ITS NOT BAD IF YOU HAVE AN ORGANIZER THE PLAYER AID IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THAT I'VE SEEN BECAUSE THEY CRAMMED A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN IT AND ITS STILL READABLE

TWILIGHT STRUGGLE ISN'T THE HEAVIEST GAME OUT THERE BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY DEEP IN STRATEGY NOT A TON OF FIDDLY COMPONENTS ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE AN ORGANIZER FOR THE INFLUENCE TOKENS I USE A DAY PILL BOX FOR EACH PLAYER IT WORKS PERFECTLY
BATTLETOWN IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE AP IS OOOO REAL OF YOUR OPTIONS VS THE OF YOUR OPPONENT AND IT'S JUST CARDS IN COMBINATIONS OF PAIRS
THERE ARE COMPONENTS AND THERE ARE FIDDLY COMPONENTS THERE IS THE EXCELLENT BUT SUPER DAMN FIDDLY ROADS AND BOATS THEN THERE IS A GAME LIKE WHICH IS HEAVY HAS A GOOD NUMBER OF COMPONENTS BUT THEY AREN'T FIDDLY COMPONENTS YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY ARRANGE MASSAGE AND BE ANXIOUS OVER

FOR THE HEAVY BUT SURPRISINGLY MANAGEABLE COMPONENT WISE GAMES I'M GOING TO GO WITH CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY THERE ARE TOKENS BUT THEY ARE USED SMOOTHLY FOR MANY THINGS THERE ARE MARKERS BUT THEY ARE VERY ICONIC AND LARGE THERE ARE CARDS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD THEM ALL THE TIME THERE ARE THINGS TO SEE ON THE BOARD BUT THEY'RE DRAWN HUGE AND ARE VISIBLE FROM ACROSS THE TABLE EVEN IF NOT PERFECTLY SIGHTED
IMPERIAL HAS THE HIGHEST DEPTH TO COMPONENTS RATIO IN MY GAME COLLECTION
GLASS ROAD BECAUSE OF THE RESOURCE WHEEL MECHANIC THE GAME CONTAINS NO CUBES NO RESOURCE CHITS AND YOU'RE NEVER PUSHING ITEMS INTO THE CENTER OF THE TABLE AND TAKING A DIFFERENT AMOUNT BACK WHEN YOU MODIFY YOUR RESOURCES YOU ALWAYS JUST SLIGHTLY ADJUST YOUR DIALECT THAT'S IT
CLUB DUPLICATE CONTRACT BRIDGE

THAT SHIT IS ROCKET SCIENCE
I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT POWER GRID IS REALLY GOOD ABOUT KEEPING FIDDLY BITS TO A MINIMUM SURE THERE'S MONEY RESOURCES AND HOUSES BUT AFTER THAT THERE'S RELATIVELY FEW ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS TO DEAL WITH
OBVIOUS ANSWERS GO AND THEN CHESS

MODERN GAMES QUORIDOR IS UP THERE MAYBE HIVE IT'S UNCLEAR SINCE I'VE MOSTLY PLAYED MY PHONE FOR THAT ONE MEXICA IS ALSO PRETTY COMPLICATED
I GUESS THIS WILL PROBABLY BE ONE OF THE EXPANDABLE CARD GAMES LET'S SAY ANDROID NETRUNNER BECAUSE IT'S MY FAVORITE

THE RULES AND TIMING STRUCTURE ARE QUITE COMPLEX ON THEIR OWN BUT IF YOU ALSO CONSIDER ALL THE INTERACTIONS IN A POOL OF CARDS THEN YOU GOT A REALLY HEAVY GAME

COMPONENTS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE BASICALLY JUST A DECK OF CARDS AND A FEW COUNTERS FOR MONEY TAGS ETC

MOST OF THE OTHER HEAVY GAMES I HAVE PLAYED ALL HAVE A TON OF FIDDLY COMPONENTS MAYBE IS ONE THAT HAS QUITE A LOT OF RULES OVERHEAD COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS JUST A FEW CARDS AND TWO KINDS OF TOKENS
WIR SIND DAS VOLK HAS A REALLY SHORT SETUP AND RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD GAMEPLAY ONCE YOU WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THE UPKEEP
AHRIMAN
SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE BASICALLY NO SETUP TIME BUT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME THINKING AND STRATEGIZING
I LOVE HOW SMALL HANSA TEUTONIA IS BOX WISE AND HOW FAST SETUP IS YET IT SUPPORTS SUCH GOOD DYNAMIC FREE STYLE PLAY
MORE ON THE MEDIUM END OF HEAVY BUT CONTAINER AND ROCOCO COME TO MIND
PROBABLY NOT THE MOST POPULAR CHOICE BUT DOMINANT SPECIES IS A GAME THAT DOESN'T HAVE TEN MILLION COMPONENTS
CCDS AND DIPLOMACY
I PERSONALLY LOVE THAT FORBIDDEN STARS DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE THOUSANDS OF TOKENS AND SUCH WHICH YOU WOULD PROBABLY EXPECT FROM A GAME LIKE THIS YEAH IT STILL HAS QUITE A BUNCH OF COMPONENTS BUT I THINK IT'S KEPT AT A MINIMUM AND IT REMAINS VERY MANAGEABLE
ALCHEMISTS DOESN'T FEEL FIDDLY AT ALL THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO TRACK IS YOUR ALCHEMY SHEET BUT IT'S PEN AND PAPER
EXPLAIN FIDDLY
IF THEY'RE VERY YOUNG LIKE OR SOMETHING YOU COULD TRY THESE

MAGIC LABYRINTH

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM
TIMELINES
FINAL TOUCH
DELETED
I REALLY HOPE THIS GAME ISN'T AWFUL ANYTHING ABOVE COMPLETE WILL PROBABLY BE AN INSTANT BUY FOR ME AS TERMINATOR IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE MOVIE FRANCHISE ALTHOUGH 2 IS MY FAVORITE IN THE SERIES THE CONCEPT SOUNDS REALLY NEAT AND I'M DEFINITELY EXCITED
WAIT WASN'T THERE ALREADY A TERMINATOR GAME WITH MINIATURES I REMEMBER SEEING THOSE MINIATURES QUITE A WHILE BACK

EDIT AFTER SOME GOOGLE FU THAT WAS TERMINATOR GENIUSES
SOUNDS INTERESTING ON PAPER NO PUN INTENDED ALWAYS WORRY WITH THIS SORT OF TIE IN THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH TIME SPENT ON TRYING TO CREATE A SET OF MECHANICS BASED ON THE THEME THAT STIFLE THE CREATION

SOUNDS LIKE THIS ONE IS A BIT MORE ABSTRACT THAN JUST BEING THE FILM IN GAME FORM THOUGH
THE MINIATURES LOOK GREAT
I'M NOT NORMALLY A MINIATURES PERSON BUT THE MINIATURES FOR THIS WILL PROBABLY BE AWESOME

THAT BEING SAID I DOUBT THE GAMEPLAY IS GOING TO BE WORTH A DAMN ALTHOUGH I LIKE THE IDEA OF TWO SIMULTANEOUS BOARDS IN DIFFERENT TIMELINES WITH DIFFERENT GOALS IN THEORY
COULD BE INTERESTING IF THIS WAS SOME GOOD MIX BETWEEN TIME TRAVEL AND DUDES ON A MAP OR SOMETHING I HAVE TROUBLE ENVISIONING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN A COMBAT GAME WITH THOSE TERMINATOR

WOULD ALSO BE COOL IF THE TERMINATOR'S WERE DAMN INDESTRUCTIBLE LIKE THEY ACTUALLY FELT IN 2 INSTEAD OF THE CRAPPY LATER MOVIES
WITH THE BASE AT AND THE GAMBLER AT BEING ON THE FENCE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I JUMP IN NOW OR IN DAYS IM CERTAINLY NOT BACKING AT
THAT IS INCREDIBLE I WONDER IF KD M WILL SET A NEW RECORD FOR TOTAL FUNDING FOR BOARD GAMES
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PANDEMIC LEGACY I WOULD SUGGEST NOT GETTING THE ORIGINAL OR GET THE APP AND TRY THAT IF YOU MUST WHY WELL IF YOU PLAY THROUGH ALL OF LEGACY AND STILL WANT TO PLAY PANDEMIC YOU CAN BUY IT THEN BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE I WILL PROBABLY NEVER TOUCH MY COPY OF PANDEMIC AGAIN IT'S ONLY UP TO PLAYERS THOUGH

TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES ALSO GOES UP TO ONLY PLAYERS AND I'D RECOMMEND IT TOO BUT KEEPING IN MIND THAT YOU GET ONLY ONE SCENARIO TO PLAY THROUGH AND YOU'LL BE PLAYING IT TIMES AND THAT'S IT YOU'LL NEED TO BUY THE EXPANSIONS TO KEEP PLAYING I OWN ALL THE RELEASED EXPANSIONS AND I PLAN TO BUY ANY OTHERS THAT COME OUT

THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONES I'VE PLAYED FROM YOUR LIST THOUGH I AM INTERESTED IN PLAYING DARK MOON
I AM DEFINITELY BIASED TOWARDS BETRAYAL IT'S NOT MECHANICALLY HEAVY OR SUPER STRATEGIC BUT IT OOZES THEME IF YOUR GROUP LIKES OLDER B HORROR FILMS THEY'LL LOVE BETRAYAL YOU COULD GRAB BETRAYAL AND THE NEWLY RELEASED EXPANSION WALK FOR AROUND FROM AMAZON
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NEW IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE JUST BOUGHT CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG AND I OWN CARCASSONNE AND LOAR CG

RIGHT NOW I'M LEANING TOWARDS DEAD OF WINTER USUALLY ONLY PLAY 2 PEOPLE
CHECK OUT LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL IT'S A FAVORITE IN MY GROUP ONE PERSON PLAYS AS JACK THE RIPPER AND EVERYONE ELSE ARE DETECTIVES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE HE IS AND ARREST HIM BEFORE HE ESCAPES IT'S THE BEST STRESS EVER
SECOND OF COURSE IT'S THE IMPROVED VERSION AND MORE READILY AVAILABLE
MY GROUP PREFERS 1ST EDITION BY QUITE A MARGIN IT IS MORE OF A CLASSIC DUNGEON CRAWL WHERE AS 2ND IS KIND OF SKIRMISHES
I HAVEN'T PLAYED GHOST STORIES BUT I LOVE CLAUSTROPHOBIA IT'S A GREAT 2 PLAYER GAME WITH A LOT OF REPLACEABILITY YOU CAN DO EACH SCENARIO AT LEAST TWICE ONCE AS DEMON ONCE AS HUMAN AND THERE'S ABOUT FREE SCENARIOS FROM THE PUBLISHER HERE

YOU HAVE TO LIKE STRATEGIC PLACEMENT THOUGH OKAY I'M GOING TO LEAVE THIS GIRL HERE AND MOVE THIS GUY HERE SO THE DEMONS NEED TO BURROW UNDERGROUND IN ORDER TO SPAWN AND UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE A DUNGEON CRAWLER YOU DON'T LEVEL UP CHARACTERS OR EQUIPMENT ALSO THERE'S NOT MUCH EQUIPMENT AND THERE'S ONLY TWO TYPES OF DEMONS EACH SCENARIO TROGLODYTE AND THE DEMON SPECIFIC TO THAT SCENARIO WHICH IS INDICATED ON A CARD THE MINI STAYS THE SAME

IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT AND YOU REALLY WANT TO HACK AND SLASH AND HAVE DICE MANIPULATION ISH MECHANICS THEN FOR I'D SAY GO FOR IT IT'S WORTH EATING RICE FOR A WEEK JUST ROAST YOUR VEG IN THE OVEN MIX IT WITH SOME GREEN CURRY SAUCE AND POUR IT OVER QUINOA THERE CHEAP YUMMY HEALTHY SUPPERS AND CLAUSTROPHOBIA
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR CLAUSTROPHOBIA HAVEN'T PLAYED IT IS A PLAYER VS PLAYER GAME I BELIEVE WHILE GHOST STORIES IS A CO-OP IN TERMS OF REPLACEABILITY I'VE HAD GHOST STORIES FOR TWO YEARS AND WE STILL BRING IT TO THE TABLE IT'S GOT VARIABLE PLAYER POWERS AND TONS OF FINAL BOSSES WHEN PLAYING GHOST STORIES YOU HAVE TO ENJOY CRUSHING DIFFICULTY AND THE REALITY THAT YOU WON'T WIN OF THE TIME THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND EACH IMPROVES YOUR POLYSTYLE I CAN'T TELL YOU WHICH IS BETTER BUT I CAN SAY GHOST STORIES IS A GREAT CO-OP BEAUTIFUL ART TOO
CLAUSTROPHOBIA FOR BUCKS IS A STEAL GREAT PRICE FOR A GREAT GAME FOR THAT PRICE THAT'D BE MY RECOMMENDATION IN REALITY THOUGH IF YOU'RE ALREADY OVER BUDGET MAYBE DON'T BUY ANOTHER GAME WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE ANOTHER DEAL AND NEW GAMES TO GET
FOR TWO PLAYERS CLAUSTROPHOBIA FOR SURE
TOTALLY DIFFERENT GAMES DO YOU WANT A KIND OF LIGHT CO-OP OR AN INVOLVED BATTLE WITH SOME SWEET MINIS I'VE ONLY PLAYED GS AND IT'S SERVICEABLE BUT NOTHING EXCEPTIONAL IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST AS GOOD

ON VALUE ALONE A BETTER DEAL
I STILL AM OF THE OPINION THAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO BUILD A GAME AS THEY GO INSTEAD OF HAVING A PROPER GAME ALREADY DESIGNED AND READY TO GO THIS EXPLAINS THE BREAD-CRUMB REVEALS OF SMALL PIECES OF GAMEPLAY AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPERS THEMSELVES ADMITTING THAT THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT CERTAIN MECHANICS

I CANCELLED MY PLEDGE AND RECEIVED A REFUND LAST WEEK I ENDED UP TAKING ABOUT A LOSS IN TOTAL BETWEEN FEES AND THE VALUE OF THE POUND DROPPING SINCE MAY I DO NOT HAVE ANY REGRETS ABANDONING THIS PROJECT I WAS VERY MUCH ON THE FENCE FROM THE AND IT WAS AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT TO EVEN BACK THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE
I PLEDGED TO GET THOSE MINIS THE GAME WAS SECONDARY FOR ME IF IT'S GOOD I'LL BE VERY HAPPY IF NOT I STILL GET SOME SWEET MODELS FROM AN IP I LOVE
I HAVE TO ADMIT I EXPECTED MORE FROM THE UPDATES IT REALLY SEEMS THEY'RE STILL HEAVILY WORKING ON THE GAME AND I ACTUALLY HOPE THEY'LL DELAY IT TO MAKE SURE THE GAME IS GREAT INSTEAD OF RUSHING IT TO MEET THE DEADLINES THEY DELAYED THE WHOLE GAME AND NOT ONLY THE AND STRETCH GOALS I'M SURE THE END PRODUCT BENEFITTED FROM THE EXTRA FEW MONTHS

I'M STILL KEEPING MY PLEDGE AND PROBABLY ADD COUPLE OF MEGA BOSSES BUT I'M TURNING A BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE GAMEPLAY SINCE THEY CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT FINISHED NOT TO MENTION BALANCING AND POLISHING AND THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO GET EVERYTHING FINISHED FOR MANUFACTURING

THERE'S STILL HOPE THAT THEY'LL MANAGE TO MAKE A GREAT GAME OR MAYBE THEY SHOULD DO LIKE RIOT DID WITH MASM AND INVITE REVIEWERS TO PLAY THE GAME AND TAKE A FEW MONTHS TO ADJUST IT BASED ON THE FEEDBACK
I DON'T REGRET MY PURCHASE AS A GIANT FAN OF THE IP I AM HOPING FOR BUT NOT EXPECTING A GREAT GAME

THE PLAY THROUGH THROUGH MINI BOSS ON TWITCH WILL BE VERY TELLING
ONE OF THE LAST UPDATES MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SKIP ENCOUNTERS YOU'VE BEATEN BEFORE WHICH IS SOMETHING I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH YEAH THOSE ENEMIES MIGHT SEEM TRIVIAL BUT THIS IS DARK SOULS AND THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT EVEN THE EASY ENCOUNTERS WILL FORCE YOU TO USE A CHARGE OF THAT ESTUS FLASK THAT MAKES YOU CONSIDER JUST GOING BACK AND TRYING AGAIN INSTEAD OF HEADING INTO THE BOSS AT LESS THAN
I SPLIT A PLEDGE WITH A FRIEND BECAUSE WE BOTH LIKE THE MODELS SO MUCH

I DON'T NORMALLY BACK KICKSTARTER PROJECTS FOR REASONS LIKE THIS I ACTUALLY DON'T CARE TERRIBLY MUCH ABOUT THE GAME ITSELF I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN IT BEING GREAT EVEN IF THE RULES ARE GOOD THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE IT WON'T HIT THE TABLE A LOT BECAUSE I HAVE A FEELING IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY BRUTAL

IF THE GAME COMES OUT AND IT'S FUN ALL THE BETTER IF NOT I'M EXCITED TO PAINT SOME OF THESE MODELS
MY GREATEST FEAR DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE MOMENT IS THE NODE PLACEMENT ON THE TILES FROM ALL THE PICTURES IT APPEARS THAT THE NODES ARE GOING TO BE PLACED IN EXACTLY THE SAME SPOTS AS ALL THE OTHER TILES I DON'T LIKE THIS BECAUSE IN DARK SOULS THE ENVIRONMENT IS A KEY PART OF THE COMBAT THERE SHOULD BE NARROW HALLWAYS STAIRCASES OBSTRUCTING OBJECTS DIFFERENT SHAPED ROOMS AND OTHER THINGS OF THAT SORT THAT MAKE TILES DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER

I EXPRESSED THIS CONCERN IN AN AMA AND A DEV ASSURED ME THAT NODE PLACEMENT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM TILE TO TILE AND AGREED WITH MY ASSESSMENT I ALSO FOUND THE SAME THING BEING SAID IN 2 OTHER PLACES BY DEVS NOT ON THE ACTUAL KICKSTARTER PAGE THOUGH

ASSETS W FIT MAX V AUTO FORMAT Q S

THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TILES ARE ONLY DIFFERENT COSMETICALLY THE NODES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME I'M A BIT ANGRY THAT I WAS BLATANTLY LIED TO THEY DIDN'T SAY THEY WERE CONSIDERING DOING IT THEY SAID THEY WERE CURRENTLY WORKING ON IT WHEN I EXPLICITLY SAID MY BACKING HINGED ON IT I'M NOT GOOD AT SEARCHING FOR OLD REDDIN COMMENTS SO I CAN LINK IT WORD FOR WORD
THIS MAY BE THE WRONG PLACE TO ASK THIS BUT DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON THE GAME IF THEY MISSED THE KICKSTARTER I SAW THIS AGES AGO AND WANTED TO PLEDGE BUT FORGOT ABOUT IT AM I TOO LATE
I THINK JUST ABOUT ALL THE UPDATES THEY'VE POSTED IN THE LAST WEEK HAVE BEEN GREAT THE ONLY THING I HAVE A RESERVATION ABOUT IS EVERYONE STARTING BACK AT THE BONFIRE AS SOON AS SOMEONE DIES I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE DOING THAT BUT IT JUST SOUNDS SILLY
YOU GUYS HAVE GOT TO STOP BUYING GAMES JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE IP THEY'RE BASED ON OTHERWISE THIS IS JUST GOING TO KEEP HAPPENING
STEAMFORGE HAS ADMITTED THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON A LOT OF CONCEPTS DURING THE CAMPAIGN SO I'M NOT REALLY SURPRISED I WATCHED THE DANCER FIGHT THEY ORIGINALLY SHOWED OFF AND THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A TON OF FUN SO I PLEDGED I DON'T PAINT MINIS SO I JUST WANTED THE GAME I HAVE NO DOUBT THIS WILL BE AN ENJOYABLE GAME ESPECIALLY AFTER SEEING THE NEW CHANGES
I AM EXCITED FOR IT LOOKS LIKE A FUN GAME AND MODULAR ENOUGH TO CUSTOMIZE FOR INCREASED ENJOYMENT DON'T LIKE THE DEATH RULE CHANGE IT WANT TO MAKE THE GAME EASIER OR INSANELY HARDER CHANGE ENCOUNTER DECK WANT TO TAKE ON A BOSS GAUNTLET LITTLE OR NO ENCOUNTERS DO IT INVADERS EQUALS A REALLY TOUGH BOSS COOL

I FEEL PEOPLE ARE BEING OVERLY VOCAL AND CRITICAL OF THE GAME IF YOU WANT TO JUMP OFF THE PROJECT THAT IS FINE BUT IS ALL THE BITCHING AND MOANING REALLY HELPING ANYTHING JUST BAIL QUIETLY PLEASE AS SOMEONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE PROJECT I DON'T CARE IF EXTRA SHIPPING WAS THE LAST STRAW
THERE IS NO GAME IS THE BOX JUST A SET OF MINIATURES
TONIGHT IS THE LIVE STREAM OF THE GAME BY AFG IF IT LOOKS LIKE A I'LL SEE ABOUT GETTING A REFUND I DO HOPE IT'S A REALLY GREAT PLAY THROUGH AND ALLEVIATES THE FEARS PEOPLE HAVE
I'M BEHIND AFG AS A COMPANY BUT IT SEEMED FROM THE START THAT THEY WEREN'T GIVEN ENOUGH LEAD-IN TIME LIKELY BY NACO WANTING TO TIME THE KS NEAR THE RELEASE OF AT LEAST THEY'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON IT AND IT'S ACTIVELY DEVELOPING INTO A GAME I JUST HOPE THE FAN SUGGESTIONS DON'T MAKE A MESS OF IT A LOT OF TIMES THESE THINGS TURN OUT AN AWFUL MESS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEY PULL A KINGDOM DEATH AND DESPITE EVERYTHING END UP AMAZING FINGERS CROSSED
I THINK IT STILL LOOKS FANTASTIC THE RULES GENERALLY MAKE SENSE TO ME PERSONALLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE COMPLAINING ABOUT RULES PEOPLE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THE RULES ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF A LOAD OF PLAY TESTING AND I'M SURE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO JUDGE THEM THE AMOUNT OF WHINING ABOUT RULES PEOPLE HAVE THEORY CRAFTED WITH NO PERSONAL TESTING IS RIDICULOUS

I LOVE THE RECENT UPDATES TO THE TRAPS ETC I LOVE THE PLAY UNTIL ONE DIES IDEA GENUINE TEAMWORK REQUIRED CONTROL OF THE THREAT MARKER WILL BE ESSENTIAL REALLY HOPING THEY STICK TO THEIR CORE GAME RELEASE DATE
I WANT TO CHECK IT OUT BUT I DON'T WANT TO GIVE BACO ANY MORE MONEY THEY'VE RUINED THIS SERIES
A GREAT TIME TO BACK THE ADM KS I SAY
I'M ALL BUT CERTAIN TO WAIT FOR RETAIL AND REVIEWS NOW SEEMS CRAZY COMPLICATED FOR THE SAKE OF BEING SO I DON'T EVEN MIND LOTS OF ICONS BUT THIS IS A MESS
THIS IS A HILARIOUS RULES EXPLANATION IT'S LIKE CONES OF DENSHIRE EVEN THE SETUP IS HILARIOUS

PLACE ONE OF THE ROYAL TOKENS ON THE KING TILE

OK COOL

NEXT FLIP OTHER ROYAL TOKENS TO REVEAL PRAYER BEADS

WAIT WHAT

THEN PLACE PRAYER BEADS ON THE MONK TILE

UH OK I GUESS THAT'S

THEN PLACE THE REMAINING PRAYER BEAD ON THE GOLDEN CHICKEN

HELP
THIS GAME SEEMS SO RIDICULOUSLY COMPLICATED MINUTES OF EXPLANATION AT FULL SPEED AND I'M STILL CONFUSED ABOUT MUCH OF THE GAME THERE SEEMS TO BE LOADS OF RULES EXCEPTIONS AND THE ART DIRECTION HAS TAKEN PRECEDENCE OVER CLEAR ICONOGRAPHY

THIS MIGHT SOUND LIKE NITPICKING BUT I'M COLORBLIND AND I'M NOT SURE WHY THE DESIGNER HAS CHOSEN SUCH SIMILAR COLOURS FOR THE DIFFERENT GOODS AND DIFFERENT PLAYER TOKENS HOPEFULLY THEY CHANGE THIS BEFORE PRODUCTION
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY FIDDLY MESS IS ALL THAT COMES TO MIND
HELLO EVERYONE THIS IS MARK THE DESIGNER OF FEUDUM I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GAME I HAVE PLAYED MANY HEAVY EUROS AND CONSIDER FEUDUM MEDIUM HEAVY I'LL ADMIT I THOUGHT THE CONES OF DENSHIRE COMMENT WAS FUNNY I OFTEN THINK OF THAT AS I EXPLAIN THE RULES TO NEW FOLKS HAHA BUT BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT THE AFTER A SINGLE PLAYTHROUGH THINGS BEGIN TO CLICK I AGREE THE SETUP IS INVOLVED BUT THE INTENT WAS TO CREATE A NUANCED GAME OF SUBSTANCE WITH A WORKING ECOSYSTEM I AM FAIRLY NEW TO THE REDDIN COMMUNITY AND WELCOME YOUR FEEDBACK PLEASE KNOW THAT I LISTEN INTENTLY TO CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM IT HAS DRIVEN ME TO CREATE A BETTER GAME THAT SAID WHILE I HAVE HAD SOME LESS THAN FAVORABLE REACTIONS I HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY ENCOURAGED TO RECEIVE EXCELLENT REVIEWS FROM LIFELONG GAMERS ONE SUCH REVIEW WAS FROM LANCE FROM THE UNDEAD VIKING I TOOK HIS WORDS TO BE A GOOD SIGN THAT I WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND HAD DESIGNED SOMETHING SPECIAL I HOPE YOU AGREE HERE'S WHAT HE SAID THIS IS COMPLETELY UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT I'VE PLAYED IT HAD THAT MOMENT OF FRESHNESS I'VE PLAYED WELL OVER A THOUSAND GAMES NOW FOR ME TO ACTUALLY FIND THAT IN A GAME IS ASTOUNDING TO ME WHEN I CAN FIND A GAME THAT GIVES ME THAT WHOA TYPE OF REACTION I GET EXCITED AGAIN FEUDUM IS A RARITY OF RARITIES IN THE BOARD GAME WORLD I CAN'T RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH IT IS BEAUTIFUL IT HAS HIGH INTERACTIVITY BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER PLAYERS IT HAS THAT QUINTESSENTIAL MULTIPLE PATHS TO VICTORY THAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO LOVE I JUDGE A GAME BY HOW MANY PLAYS I CAN GET OUT OF IT FEUDUM FEELS LIKE IT'S A BOX OF THAT THING THAT I M LOOKING FOR TONS OF EXPLORATION AND TONS OF WAYS TO WIN THIS IS A GAME THAT I WILL BE PULLING DOWN ON A REPEATED BASIS THE GAME IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC LANCE MYXTER OF UNDEAD VIKING

THANKS FOR LISTENING
I'LL REPEAT WHAT I'VE SAID BEFORE BUT HAS ANYONE LOOKED OVER THE RULES THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF THAT YOUR CARDS DO THAT ISN'T LISTED ON THE CARDS THIS WILL MAKE IT A NIGHTMARE TEACH I FEEL AS EVIDENCED BY THE PRACTICALLY HALF HOUR VIDEO BASICALLY HOW DOES THIS WORK AND CAN I LOOK AT THE RULEBOOK EVERY MINUTE IT DOES NOT LOOK VERY INTUITIVE TO TEACH OR PLAY INITIALLY AND YES I GET THAT MIGHT BE JUST THE WAY THE GAME IS BUT REALLY ARE WE AT THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER ALL THE EDGE CASES OR EXTRA ACTIONS A CARD DOES THAT AREN'T LISTED ON THE CARD WAS EXCITED ABOUT THIS TOO AND EVEN THE UGH GIVE EVERYONE CARDS TO PICK FROM ISN'T AS BAD AS GLASS ROAD BUT THE ACTIONS ARE JUST TOO DETAILED AND EACH HAS TO BE MOSTLY REMEMBERED YES MOVE MEANS MOVE A PAWN BUT YOU ALSO GET TO PILFER AFTERWARDS WHERE'S THE ICONOGRAPHY FOR THAT I WAS EXCITED
I HELD OFF BACKING THIS AS I DIDN'T WANT TO GET SWEPT AWAY BY THE HYPE A LOT OF REVIEWERS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE GAME BUT NONE OF THEM HAD ACTUALLY PLAYED IT SURE THE GAME LOOKS GREAT BUT ESPECIALLY SO WITH A NEW UNTRIED DESIGNER A GAME NEEDS MORE THAN A NOVEL LOOK TO EARN MY TITHE

I PREFER HEAVIER GAMES ARKWRIGHT BRASS LACERNA SO THE COMPLEXITY OF SO MANY MOVING PARTS APPEALS TO BE BUT THIS VIDEO DID A POOR JOB OF EXPLAINING HOW ALL THOSE RULES INTERMESH IT AIN'T A SIMPLE RULES SET SO A LIGHT HEARTED OVERVIEW THAT TOUCHED ON THE MANY RULES WITHOUT REALLY EXPLAINING THEM WAS ALWAYS GOING TO MAKE IT SEEM MORE CONVOLUTED NOT LESS SO

THEN I WATCHED UNDEAD REVIEW AND WHILE IT ISN'T AS POLISHED AS THE ANIMATED VIDEO IT DOES A FAR BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING HOW ALL THOSE RULES WORK TOGETHER IT GAVE A REAL SENSE OF THE MANY MECHANISMS ACTING SYNERGISTICALLY ESPECIALLY HOW AREA CONTROL ELEMENTS OF THE MAIN BOARD INFLUENCE YOUR GUILD DOMINANCE WHICH IN TURN ALLOW YOU TO CONTROL ONE PART OF THE FLOW OF GOODS TO REALLY EXPAND THE DECISION SPACE SUGGESTING A FAIR DEGREE OF STRATEGIC DEPTH

I HAPPILY BACKED IT THE NEXT DAY
I HAVE UNDERSTOOD BIOS GENESIS THIS WILL BE A
STILL NOT BACKING TOO EXPENSIVE
THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF ELEGANCE BEING SACRIFICED FOR COMPLEXITY TO ACHIEVE DEPTH OF GAMEPLAY

GLAD I AM NOT BACKING IT ESPECIALLY AT THE RIDICULOUS PRICE THEY ARE ASKING FOR IT
I BACKED THIS ON DAY ONE AND THEN WAS A LITTLE DISMAYED BY SOME OF THE DISCUSSION ON HERE THOUGH THAT TENDED TO BE ABOUT ADDITIONAL COST FOR THE EXPANSIONS WATCHING THIS VIDEO THOUGH GOT ME PUMPED UP AGAIN I'M REALLY IMPRESSED WITH HOW THEY'RE HANDLING THIS KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN I AGREE WITH THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE EXPANSIONS NOT BEING INCLUDED AND I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE PICKING ANY OF THEM UP WATCHING THIS VIDEO THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH GAME FOR ME
THIS IS CLEARLY THE BEST HOW TO PLAY VIDEO EVER MADE AND THE GAME IT IS TEACHING LOOKS LIKE A PARODY OF A HEAVY EURO GAME I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW ATROCIOUSLY COMPLICATED IT IS AND GLAD I SKIPPED THE KICKSTARTER
I HAVE TO WATCH IT AGAIN BUT IT DOES SOUND PRETTY HEAVY AND INTERESTING DECEMBER WILL BE A ROUGH MONTH FOR MY WALLET WITH FEUDUM LISBOA AND THE SECOND EDITION OF VAST THE CRYSTAL CAVERNS ALL ON KICKSTARTER AT THE SAME TIME
ANYONE ELSE GETTING A CONES OF DENSHIRE FEEL FROM THIS GAME
I THOUGHT THIS VIDEO WAS VERY WELL DONE AND EXPLAINED THE RULES IN A CLEAN CONCISE WAY THAT IS EASY TO FOLLOW THAT SAID I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO GET A RUN THROUGH FROM THIS GAME AND BELIEVE IT EMBRACES A VERY UNIQUE MULTIPLE PATHS TO VICTORY FORMAT WHILE HAVING A UNIQUE WAY OF PUSH-PULL MECHANIC IN THE GUILD SYSTEM COMPLICATED YES INCOMPREHENSIBLE NUMBER BUT WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THIS IS A HEAVY EURO TYPE GAME

AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA IT IS A HEAVIER EURO IF YOUR TYPE OF GAME IS CROKINOLE OR RISK WHERE YOU DON'T CARE FOR A LOT OF THINKING THROUGH PERMUTATIONS AND WHAT YOUR OPPONENTS WILL DO YOU PROBABLY WON'T ENJOY THIS GAME AS MUCH GRANTED THAT I THINK THE APPEAL IS BEYOND ARTWORK BUT THE STRATEGIC REPLACEABILITY I BELIEVE THAT THE APPEAL WILL SHOW OVER TIME BEGIN FORTUNATE TO PLATIEST THIS I HAVE ALSO GOT A CHANCE TO TALK TO MARK FROM TALKING TO HIM I KNOW THAT HE IS ONE THAT PAYS GREAT ATTENTION TO DETAIL CARES ABOUT FEEDBACK AND STRIVES TO MAKE THE GAME BETTER

MY 2 CENTS IS THIS IF YOU LOVE HEAVY EURO GAMES WITH GOOD COMPETITIVE STRATEGY WITH NO ONE SINGLE WAY TO WIN THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT GAME TO TRY OUT THINK OF IT LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU TAKE A DIVE IN A POOL OR SOMETHING THAT IS CHALLENGING ONCE YOU BREAK THROUGH THE CURVE IT'S WORTH IT TRUST ME I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY THIS GAME AND HAVE BEEN THINKING OF NEW SPRATS TO ATTEMPT FOR FUTURE PLAYS
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS ONE THE ART THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE MECHANICS THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS ONE FOR MYSELF
THIS LOOKS LIKE A TOTAL MESS
THIS IS RUBBISH MINUTES IN AND I'M OUT GIVE ME TWILIGHT IMPERIUM IT IS PRETTY THOUGH
OH DEAR THE GAME LOOKS INTERESTING BUT I'M REALLY NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO TEACHING THIS TO MY GAMING GROUP
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT A PANIC ABOUT THE SETUP VIDEO THIS ISN'T HOW THE GAME PLAYS IT'S JUST AN ALTERNATIVE RULES AND SETUP SOURCE I'VE PLAYED THE GAME SEVERAL TIMES AND I NEVER EVEN READ THE RULES THOUGH I KNOW THEM NOW AFTER GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS A FEW TIMES AT THIS POINT SETTING UP THE GAME ISN'T DIFFICULT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE ARBITER AND WARRIORS SHOULD GET THEIR CONES FOR NO WAIT THAT'S ANOTHER GAME I MEAN SETUP IS EASY BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT A ROYAL SEAL AND A PRAYER BEAD ARE NOW IT'S A SIMPLE GAME TO PLAY IT'S JUST DIFFICULT TO WIN

THIS GUY SAYS IT PRETTY WELL
WATCH V
I'VE PLAYED A PROTOTYPE OF THE GAME WITH THE CREATOR AND IT REALLY IS AN AWESOME GAME YES IT IS A BIT COMPLICATED TO LEARN BUT PLAYS EASILY ONCE YOU GET GOING I'LL SEE IF I CAN ASK MARK THE CREATOR TO POP IN AND ADDRESS CONCERNS HERE THIS GAME IS VERY MUCH WORTH PLAYING AND BACKING
THIS GAME LOOKS AWESOME TO ME BUT I DONT KNOW IF I'LL LIKE IT MUCH NOT PLAYING IT FIRST
I DON'T THINK A SLIGHT SHACKS CAM EFFECT IS THE WAY TO GO FOR A VIDEO EXPLAINING RULES OF A BOARD GAME PLUS THE QUICK PANS MAKE IT HARD TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY WENT A BIT TOO CRAZY WITH THE COMPOSING AND EDITING TOOLS HERE
USE A SITE LIKE CAMELCAMELCAMEL TO SEE THE TREND OVER TIME AND THE LOWEST AND HIGHEST PRICES
DO THIS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT POSTAGE I SAW A FEW THINGS I'VE WANTED AROUND BUT WENT WITH MY AGS FOR MOST OF THEM BECAUSE ADDING ON POSTAGE MADE THEM ALMOST THE SAME PRICE

THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH GETTING YOURSELF A GOOD DEAL AND GETTING THE BEST VALUE YOU POSSIBLY CAN BUT IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY TAKE A CHANCE AND BUY SOMETHING YES YOU'LL SAVE THE MOST MONEY BUT YOU WON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY GAMES AS MUCH AS YOU CAN THEORIZE AND SPECULATE THAT'S ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO UNTIL THE SALES YOU SEE SOMETHING FOR WHAT YOU THINK IS A GOOD PRICE WITH POSTAGE GO FOR IT
ROBINSON CRUSOE IS THE OLDER EDITION THE NEWEST WILL BE RELEASED IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND GOES FOR UNDER FIFTY NOW WITH DELUXE COMPONENTS DEF PASS ON THAT



LOL ALL THE SHAME GAMES DOWN AT THE BOTTOM PHOTOBOMBING YOUR NICE STUFF


NICE WORK IN JUST ONE YEAR
THAT'S QUITE A SOLID COLLECTION A LOT OF EXCELLENT GAMES IN THAT MIX WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITES OF THE BUNCH
I HAVE A FEW OF THESE SOLID YEARS WORTH LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE COVERED ALOT OF GENRES NO TRY MARKHAM HORROR CG IT'S GREAT
HOW IS KNIERIM SYLVIAN BASTILLION I KNOW THEY ARE SOLITAIRE GAMES BUT THEY SEEM INTRIGUING
THE EXPANSION TO SMASH UP GET PRETTY FUN AS A MAKE ADULT THE PRETTY PRINCESS EXPANSION IS PRETTY HILARIOUS AND YOU CAN LIE TO YOURSELF THAT YOU DID IT FOR THE YOUNG PLAYERS AT HOME
I AM SEEING NO JUNK ARTICLE FLICK IS MORE OF A TOY WHEREAS JUNK ART IS A GAME HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ALSO NOT A FAN OF THE LICENSE BUT GODFATHER A NEW DON IS REALLY GOOD
LQOVHKY


I'M LIKE SEVEN MONTHS IN
VERY NICE I ALSO HAVE A YEAR OLD COLLECTION AND WE HAVE A LOT OF GAME IN COMMON
JUST PLAYED MANSIONS OF MADNESS FOR THE FIRST TIME SUCH A GREAT GAME PROBABLY ONE OF THE FUNNEST GAMING MOMENTS IVE HAD
NOTICED YOU GOT BANG CDG FUSE AND KING OF TOKYO IN YOUR COLLECTION JUST ASKED THIS IN ANOTHER THREAD BUT SEEING THAT YOU OWN ALL YOU'LL PROBABLY BE BEST AT ANSWERING

WHICH OF THE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO GET FIRST I KNOW EVENTUALLY I MIGHT GET THE OTHER 2 DOWN THE LINE SOMEHOW
EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN RISING SUN NOW SEEMS LIKE A TIGHTLY DESIGNED GAME WITH LOTS OF DECISIONS

HAVING NOT PLAYED TERRAFORMING MARS YET I MUST ADMIT THE ARTISTIC CHOICES IN THOSE CARDS SEEM TERRIBLE I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY THE GRAPHIC DESIGN THAT WAS A BIT OFF THOSE BRIGHT YELLOWS AND GREENS THE SILVER GRADIENTS ETC BUT THE PICTURES DRAWINGS ARE SIMPLY BAD
GLAD HE PICKED OUT HONSHU ITS A GAME THAT I'VE HAD SINCE ESSEN I WROTE ABOUT IT ON MY BLOG AND I REALLY ENJOY IT ITS PRETTY SIMPLE BUT NOT EASY FOR SURE ONE OF MY BEST GAMES SO FAR THIS YEAR BUT THAT COULD BE BECAUSE I HAD NO EXPECTATIONS FOR IT
FLAMBE ROUGE SOUNDS AWESOME LOOKING AT THAT SETUP IS SEEMS EVEN MORE AWESOME TO ME I LOVE THE THEME
SOMEONE WHO CAN FINALLY SUM UP HOW I FEEL ABOUT TERRAFORMING MARS IT'S A GREAT GAME VERY WELL PRODUCED BUT I DON'T THINK I EVER WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN I'VE PLAYED IT TWICE NOW AND EVERY TIME WAS LIKE THE MOST INTENSE ROLLER COASTER EVER THAT DURING THE LAST HALF ONLY WENT DOWN FURTHER AND FURTHER
IF PAUL LIKED HONSHU IT'S A PITY HE MISSED CAPITAL
WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WERE PAULA DEEN COULD BE PROMOTING A GAME WHERE THE PLAYERS COMPETE TO ADD THE MOST BUTTER TO THEIR RECIPES WHICH STRANGELY SOMEHOW WOULDN'T MAKE IT INTO A LIST OF STRANGEST BOARD GAME THEMES
IT FEELS WEIRD THAT I WATCHED HER GROW UP OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS SHE WAS A KID WHEN I STARTED PLAYING BOARD GAMES
AS A GIRL IN THE HOBBY AND A MOM OF A LITTLE GIRL TOO I LOVE THAT SHE IS GROWING INTO HER OWN ROLE AT DT MY KIDS LOVE WATCHING HER AND IT IS SO NICE TO HAVE SUCH AN HONEST AND GENUINE VOICE IN THE HOBBY
HOLY MOLY SHE HAS GROWN UP FAST
MELODY'S ADVICE HAS BEEN INVALUABLE OVER THE YEARS FOR HELPING PICK GAMES FOR MY KIDS

LOOK FORWARD TO THE REST OF THE INTERVIEW

IT TRULY IS A NICE THING TO SEE ONE'S FAMILY GROW UP THROUGH OUR HOBBY SHE SEEMS LIKE AN AFFABLE YOUNG LADY
NICE INTERVIEW I THINK SHE CAME ACROSS AS REALLY FRIENDLY AND CHILLED IT'D BE GREAT TO SEE MORE INTERVIEWS LIKE THIS
WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE PRICE AT THE TIME OF A SALE OFTEN THEY RAISE PRICES IS ONLY OFF EACH GAME MORE OFTEN THAN NOT CSI MM FA HAVE THOSE PRICES TO BEGIN WITH SO SHOPPING WITH THEM FOR BLACK FRIDAY OR WAITING FOR THE MULTI ANNUAL SALES IS OFTEN BETTER NOW TARGET HAVING SALES AND THEN PRICE MATCHING AMAZON CAN SOMETIMES NET BIG DEALS
DO WE KNOW WHEN THEIR SALE IS SUPPOSED TO START
IT'S PRETTY DEPENDENT ON WHAT GAMES YOU BUY AND THE DISCOUNTS OFFERED I'VE FOUNDATION MEANS YOU EFFECTIVELY GET A DISCOUNT ON TWO GAMES BUT YOU CAN MISS OUT ON DISCOUNTS OF GREATER THAN THAT I THINK PANDEMIC IS ONE OF THOSE GAMES I'D SAY LOOK AT THE ONES YOU WANT IF THE OVERALL DISCOUNT WORKS OUT AT MORE THAN THE COST OF THE CHEAPEST GAMES GO FOR IT
I LIKE BOTH GAMES I THINK THEY BOTH GET BETTER WITH MORE THAN 2 BUT NEITHER IS BAD WITH 2 SMALL WORLD TOPS OUT AT BUT WATERDEEP WILL PLAY WITH THE SCOUNDRELS OF SKULLPORT EXPANSION

I THINK WATERDEEP IS THE BETTER CHOICE FOR YOU YOUR HUSBAND BASED ON HIS LIKES
LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS A MUCH CLOSER FIT TO THE GAMES HE CURRENTLY ENJOYS AS IT INVOLVES INDIRECT CONFLICT WHEREAS SMALL WORLD IS MUCH MORE RISK LIKE AND COMBATITIVE IN ADDITION LOW IS BASED ON A DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS SETTING THAT HE MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH IT SHOULD PLAY 2 WELL BUT IS MUCH BETTER WITH SO IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON PLAYING 2 PLAYER THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME I WOULD CONSIDER LOOKING ELSEWHERE A GATEWAY GAME DESIGNED FOR TWO SUCH AS WONDERS DUEL

THE ONLY ISSUE WITH LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS IT CAN FEEL INCOMPLETE AND SLIGHTLY SHALLOW WITHOUT THE EXPANSION IN MY OPINION IT BECAME ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITE TO FAVORITE GAMES AFTER GETTING THE EXPANSION WHICH INCLUDES BOTH UNDERMOUNTAIN AND SCOUNDRELS OF SKULLPORT SO IF YOU FIND YOU LIKE THE GAMEPLAY BUT IT FEELS BASIC OR INCOMPLETE SERIOUSLY CONSIDER GETTING THE EXPANSION
I WOULD SAY LORDS OF WATERDEEP OVER SMALL WORLD I DO BELIEVE IT IS EASIER TO TEACH AND PLAY FROM THE GET GO 2 IT HAS A MUCH MORE
I LOVE LORDS OF WATERDEEP BUT TO PLAY WITH YOU ALSO NEED THE EXPANSION AND AT THAT PLAYER COUNT IT SUFFERS A LOT IT TAKES AGES AND YOU NEVER FEEL LIKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHING ANYTHING AS PROGRESS IS SO SLOW AT IT'S GREAT THOUGH I'D SUGGEST WONDERS BUT I'VE HEARD IT'S NOT GOOD AT 2 AND PLUS YOU HAVE SUSHI GO SO YOU MAY FEEL YOU HAVE YOUR DRAFTING FIX I HAVEN'T PLAYED VITICULTURE AT BUT EVEN AT IT'S GOOD IT FEELS TIGHT INSTEAD OF INFURIATING AND IT PLAYS WELL AT 2
I ADORE CARCASSONNE AND TICKET TO RIDE MY DAD LOVES TR ALSO WE PLAYED LOADS OF TR SOME CATAN SOME CARCASSONNE WE TRIED A FEW GAMES OF AGRICOLA TOO WHICH WE BOTH ENJOYED BUT IT IS A LITTLE HEAVY AND PLAYER INTERACTION IS LIMITED

I BOUGHT LORDS OF WATERDEEP ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND SINCE THEN IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY GAME WE'VE PLAYED TOGETHER IT'S HARD TO FIND ANY FLAWS IN IT REALLY OTHER THAN TOWARDS THE LATE GAME THERE CAN BE QUITE A BIT TO KEEP TRACK OF WITH COMPLETED QUESTS AND BONUSES YOU CAN PLAY VERY AGGRESSIVELY TOWARDS THE OTHER PLAYERS OR YOU CAN BE FAIRLY PASSIVE THE QUESTS AND LEADER CARDS ALONG WITH WAY MORE BUILDINGS THAN YOU CAN USE IN ONE GAME MAKE EVERY PLAYTHROUGH UNIQUE I REALLY CAN'T RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY ENOUGH IF HE IS A D D PLAYER TOO THERE ARE INSTANTLY RECOGNIZABLE ELEMENTS MOST NOTABLY HAVING WORKERS WHICH ARE ROGUES FIGHTERS WIZARDS AND CLERICS
WITH LORDS OF WATERDEEP IT'S A GREAT INTRO TO THE WORLD OF WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES WHICH I SEE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ON YOUR LIST OF GAMES THAT YOU OWN IT PLAYS OUT OF THE BOX BUT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH THEN YOU'LL NEED TO GET THE EXPANSION SCOUNDRELS OF SKULLPORT IT CONTAINS THE PIECES FOR A SIXTH PLAYER PLUS TWO MODULES WHICH ADD A LOT TO THE GAME SKULLPORT GIVES YOU EXTRA SPACES AND QUESTS WHICH PROVIDE OODLES OF RESOURCES AND POINTS ESSENTIALLY IT'S LIKE THE BASE GAME BUT ON STEROIDS UNDERMOUNTAIN INTRODUCES CORRUPTION INTO THE GAME WHICH IS A BRILLIANT MECHANISM THAT TURNS LOW FROM A GOOD INTRO GAME INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL IT ADDS A LITTLE BIT OF COMPLEXITY TO THE GAME SO YOU'RE PROBABLY BETTER OFF WITHOUT THE EXPANSION AT FIRST UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY WANT TO PLAY WITH PLAYERS PLAY THE BASE GAME FIRST MAKE SURE YOU LIKE IT AND THEN THE EXPANSION IS ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED

MOST OF THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT WATERDEEP HAVE TO DO WITH ITS THEME WHICH FEELS PRETTY PASTED ON IF YOUR HUSBAND IS A IND FAN THOUGH HE'LL PROBABLY LOVE IT THERE'S A LOT OF FLAVOR THERE FOR FANS ALTHOUGH YOU CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IND IN ORDER TO PLAY THE GAME

SMALL WORLD IS ALSO A GOOD OPTION IT FEELS LIKE A VERSION OF RISK IT'S EASY TO LEARN BUT IT AXES OUT AT PLAYERS SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK WITH THEN IT'S A NO-GO IT'S A GOOD GAME BUT IF YOUR HUSBAND IS A IND FAN AND ENJOYS GAMES LIKE TICKET TO RIDE KINGDOM BUILDER AND CARCASSONNE I'D SUGGEST GOING WITH LORDS OF WATERDEEP IT'S A GREAT INTRODUCTION TO THE WORLD OF WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES AND IT PROBABLY PLAYS BETTER WITH JUST TWO PLAYERS

AS A SIDE NOTE YOU MENTIONED PICKING UP CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON YOUR LIST THOUGH SO YOU'LL WANT TO TAKE YOUR TIME AND BE PATIENT WITH IT THE BASICS OF THE GAME ARE PRETTY SIMPLE BUY A ROOM PLACE THE ROOM SOMEWHERE IT CAN FIT SCORE POINTS AND BONUSES BUT THERE'S A BIT OF A LEARNING CURVE WITH ALL OF THE DETAILS AND THERE'S A DECENT AMOUNT GOING ON IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO LEARN BY ANY MEANS BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A STEP UP FROM THE OTHER GAMES YOU MENTIONED
AS MANY OTHERS IN THIS THREAD HAVE ALREADY SAID LOW IS PROBABLY GOING TO GET YOU THE MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK

IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE MARKET FOR A GAME THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN SIT AROUND AS THEY DRINK BEER AND CASUALLY PLAY SMALL WORLD MIGHT BE THE ONE TO PICK UP
I HAVE BOTH

LORDS OF WATERDEEP HAS A LOT MORE REPLACEABILITY TAKE OUT THE MANDATORY QUEST CARDS IF YOU ARE PLAYING WITH OR MORE PLAYERS AND THEN THERE ISN'T A LARGE MECHANISM FOR KINGMAKING WHICH IS SOMETHING MANY GAMERS GROW TO DISLIKE IT'S A FUN GAME THAT HAS MUCH MORE DEPTH THAN SMALL WORLD IF YOU ARE PLAYING WITH MORE THAN 2 PEOPLE

SMALL WORLD OUR HOUSE RULE FOR THIS GAME IS THAT POINTS ARE ALL GAINED VIA OPEN INFORMATION AND THUS ARE NOT KEPT SECRET IS A FUN GAME WHERE THE MAIN MECHANIC IS RANKING THE VALUE OF THE ABILITY RACE COMBINATION THESE COMBINATIONS DIFFER IN VALUE DEPENDING ON THE STAGE OF THE GAME FIGURING OUT WHETHER TO ATTACK THE LEADER OR TO MAXIMIZE YOUR OWN POINTS DECIDING WHEN TO RETIRE YOUR RACE AND PICK A NEW ONE FORFEITING THAT TURN AND THEN THE SIMPLISTIC POLITICS IN TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY WINNING THIS GAME HAS A LOT MORE DEPTH AS A GAME

EDIT DESPITE WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID BOTH HAVE PLAYER OPTIONS IF YOU BUY CERTAIN EXPANSIONS

IF HE REALLY LIKES MUNCHKIN THEN SMALL WORLD MIGHT BE A BETTER FIT THOUGH I AM HESITANT TO FULLY RECOMMEND THAT GAME BECAUSE THE END GAME KINGMAKING WHEN A LOSING PLAYER PICKS WHO WINS BETWEEN 1ST AND 2ND PLACE PLAYERS CAN GROW QUITE TIRESOME
LOW IS REALLY EASY TO LEARN I'VE RUN TOTAL NEWIES THROUGH THE RULES WHILE PLAYING I LOVE IT
AS A FORMER MTG PLAYER I REALLY GOT INTO DOMINION BUILDING A DECK OF COMBOS CAN GET COMPETITIVE REALLY FAST AND DRAFTING BOTH ARE CARD GAMES I ALSO LIKE SMALLSWORD VERY EASY RULES COLORFUL AND FUNNY COMBOS BUT IT IS NOTHING LIKE A CARD GAME HAVEN'T PLAYED IT WITH TWO PLAYERS I THINK IS BEST HAVEN'T PLAYED LORDS OF W ALTHOUGH WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES ARE ALSO VERY INTERESTING
YOUR GROUP AND GAMES YOU'VE PLAYED AND ENJOYED SOUNDS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO MINE INCLUDING OUR BACKGROUNDS JUST THIS WEEK OUR TWO NEWEST GAMES WERE SMALL WORLD AND LORDS OF WATERDEEP ON THE FIRST PASS WE LIKED BOTH OF THEM A LOT BUT IF WE COULD ONLY PICK ONE IT'D PROBABLY BE LORDS OF WATERDEEP SINCE IT WAS REALLY UNLIKE THE OTHER GAMES WE OWNED WHICH ARE ALL SIMILAR TO THE ONES YOU OWN ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU HAVE RISK WHICH WE DON'T HAVE SMALL WORLD COULD TAKE A BIT OF A BACK SEAT

SINCE OUR COLLECTIONS AND INTERESTS SEEM SIMILAR I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD POINT OUT ANOTHER POPULAR GAME IN MY COLLECTION WONDERS AND THE 2 PLAYER VARIANT WONDERS DUEL THE GAME SCALES VERY WELL AND WHILE ONLY DUEL WILL WORK FOR TWO PLAYERS THEY ARE BOTH AMAZINGLY FUN AND TWO OF OUR FAVORITE GAMES
WELL SINCE YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A GAME WITH WORKER PLACEMENT MECHANICS AND ALSO BECAUSE SMALL WORLD FELL FLAT WITH THE PEOPLE I PLAYED IT WITH TOO LIGHT NOT ENOUGH GOING ON DECISIONS I HAVE TO RECOMMEND LOW
I LOVE LOW AND IT'S BEEN A FAVORITE MY FRIEND GROUP FOR YEARS I FIND IT ENJOYABLE WITH 2 BUT THE MORE PLAYERS THE BETTER IN MY OPINION

JUST GOT WONDERS DUEL A FEW DAYS AGO TRACKED IT ON AMAZON AND LOVE IT A QUICK AND FAST PACED GAME IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES I'VE PLAYED SO FAR

THAT BEING SAID YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO CASTLES OF BURGUNDY IT IS A VERY FUN GAME UP TO BUT I THINK BEST WITH 2 AND VERY REPAYABLE ALSO IT INVOLVES DICE BUT NOT THAT ANG SO THAT WAS A COOL MECHANISM
LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS JUST AN AMAZING GAME FANTASTIC WORKER PLACEMENT WITH GREAT REPLACEABILITY AND FLAVOR IT IS A GOOD ENTRY TO THE WORKER PLACEMENT GENRE

SMALL WORLD IS GREAT BUT HONESTLY IT IS MORE OF A KIDS GAME WITH NO REAL STRATEGY
I LOVE PLAYING LORDS OF WATERDEEP WITH MY SO IT'S A GREAT GAME EVEN AT 2 PLAYERS AS IT IS REALLY FAST WITH LITTLE DOWN TIME THIS WAY
DOWD SMALLSWORD I'VE HAD FOREVER IT JUST BUGS ME I DON'T EVER WANT TO PLAY THAT GAME IT'S FINE IT'S JUST YOU EITHER THINK A LOT AND SCORE AS MANY POINTS AS YOU CAN WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME AND BEING ANNOYING OR YOU DIG INTO THE THEME AND JUST DO WHATEVER CRAZY SHIT YOU WANT AND HAVE FUN EITHER WAY AT THE END IT'S EH
IF YOU HAVE A TABLET OR SMART PHONE YOU CAN BUY EITHER ONE FOR ROUGHLY AND TRY THEM OUT FOR YOURSELF I'VE OWNED BOTH AND REALLY PREFERRED LORDS BUT AFTER BUYING THE APP FOR SMALLSWORD I REALLY LIKE THAT GAME AS WELL THERE WAS A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF SET UP INVOLVED WITH SMALLSWORD AND LETTING THE APP HANDLE IT REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE
THEY'RE BOTH EXCELLENT GAMES AND BOTH PLAY WELL WITH 2 I THINK SMALL WORLD IS PROBABLY THE BETTER 2 PLAYER GAME THOUGH

THAT SAID SMALL WORLD REALLY NEEDS AN EXPANSION OR TWO TO INCREASE THE VARIETY LORDS OF EXPANSION IS EXCELLENT BUT ENTIRELY OPTIONAL

OTHERWISE THEY BOTH FIT YOUR CRITERIA VERY WELL AND YOU'LL PROBABLY BE QUITE HAPPY WITH EITHER
DEPENDS IF YOU THINK THE THEME WILL HELP YOU GET IT TO THE TABLE MORE OFTEN THEN YEAH MIGHT BE WORTH IT OTHERWISE NUMBER
I AM A HUGEEEEEEEEEE A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE FAN BUT IT'S GOTTA BE COSMIC ALL DAY
GOT BOTH THEY ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY DIFFERENT HOSTAGE TAKING AND CASHING IN MIXES IT UP AND SPEEDS IT A LONG HOWEVER COSMIC IS STILL MORE FUN
COSMIC HAS A LOT MORE VARIETY AND GETTING IT TO THE TABLE IS ALMOST ALWAYS FUN BUT IRON THRONE HAD A DEEPER STRATEGY TO IT AND IT MAKES EACH INDIVIDUAL CHOICE FEEL LIKE IT'S HITTING A LOT HARDER THEY HAVE VERY SIMILAR MECHANICS BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS REAL AND NOTICEABLE IT HONESTLY DEPENDS ON IF YOU WANT THE MORE TACTICAL GAME WITH LESS VARIETY OR THE ONE THAT HAS THE CARD THAT LETS YOU SWAP CHAIRS WITH SOMEONE RIGHT AS THEY'RE ABOUT TO WIN
JUST GET COSMIC ENCOUNTER IRON THRONE WILL BE FORGOTTEN WITHIN A YEAR COSMIC WILL LIVE FOREVER
LOTS OF COSMIC FANS PROBABLY POSTING WITHOUT HAVING PLAYED IRON THRONE IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE LOOKING AT ANYTHING ELSE AFTER INVESTING IN LOTS OF CE EXPANSIONS I WAS THE SAME BUT THEN A FRIEND BOUGHT IRON THRONE IT IS REALLY BRILLIANT AND OFFERS A QUICKER PLAYING LESS CONFUSING FOR NEWCOMERS MORE THEMATIC VERSION OF A CLASSIC GET THE ONE WHICH YOU CAN PICTURE YOUR FRIENDS WANTING TO PLAY FOR ME IT'S IRON THRONE AM GOING TO SELL MY COSMIC COLLECTION
I DON'T PLAY THE GAME THAT OFTEN ANYMORE BUT I LOVE THE SYSTEM

IF THE PROBLEM IS GETTING IT TO THE TABLE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THOSE WITH WHOM YOU'D BE PLAYING I'M TOLD GOT IS A LITTLE LESS CHAOTIC AND RANDOM WHICH MIGHT ATTRACT NEW PLAYERS BUT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH NOT COSMIC ENCOUNTERS TO PULL PEOPLE FROM WHAT'S BEING PLAYED INSTEAD
JUST GET ANY OTHER GAME THAT EXISTS RATHER THAN
HOW DO PEOPLE WITH HUNDREDS OF GAMES REMEMBER THE RULES FOR ALL OF THEM DON'T YOU HAVE TO REFRESH YOURSELF WITH THE RULES EVERY TIME YOU PLAY
I WOULD LIKE A STICKY OR LARGE POST DETAILING MAYBE SOME ENTRY LEVEL GAMES FOR EACH MAJOR STYLE AND WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE IN THOSE STYLES FOR EXAMPLE I AM RELATIVELY NEW TO THE BOARD GAME SCENE AND HAVE PLAYED A FEW MAJOR ONES I HAVE CARCASSONNE WONDERS DOMINION AND A FEW OTHERS I JUST BOUGHT IN THE SALES THIS WEEK THE PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT I AM SHOOTING IN THE DARK ON THE TYPE OF GAME IT IS AND WHAT STYLE THEY ARE I AM NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT I LIKE THE MOST BUT IF THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STYLES WAS AVAILABLE THEN I WOULD BE A MORE CONSCIENTIOUS CONSUMER AND MAYBE NOT WASTE SOME MONEY ON GAMES THAT ARE NOT MY TYPE FOR EXAMPLE I AM NOT REALLY BIG ON MATCHING TYPE GAMES BUT I LIKE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF LUCK SO GAMES ARE OK BUT WHICH ONES ARE EASIER TO ACCESS I ONLY FIGURED OUT EURO GAMES WERE GOOD FOR ME BY TRIAL AND ERROR AND I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SOONER HAD I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE FROM THE BEGINNING

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT WHEN I ASK FOR ADVICE IT IS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THE MECHANICS ARE ALSO EVERYWHERE MAYBE THIS IS TOO BIG OF A PROJECT FOR SOMEONE THAT IS WELL-VERSED IN ALL OF THIS BUT IT WOULD BE A GOOD STICKY POST

EDIT AND THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES KINDA SUCK
NORMALLY MY FAMILY AND I PLAY PANDEMIC TOGETHER THIS YEAR I'M GOING TO BE STAYING WITH MY BOYFRIEND'S FAMILY FOR THANKSGIVING THOUGH I'M HOPING TO INTRODUCE THEM TO LOTS OF GREAT GAMES THAT WILL FIT THEIR EXISTING TASTES AS TRADITIONAL PLAYING CARD GAMERS ARBORETUM SKULL AND BEYOND BAKER STREET AMONG OTHERS

AS A RELATED QUESTION WHAT'S EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE WITH SAMURAI SPIRIT IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES WHICH I'LL ALSO BE BRINGING AND I'VE ONLY EVER PLAYED IT AND MY BOYFRIEND AND I NORMALLY PLAY ON HARD MODE AND BY OURSELVES SO WE'RE NOT SURE WHICH MODE TO PLAY WITH NEWIES WHICH SAMURAI WE SHOULD PLAY AS ETC ALSO WHILE WE FEEL THAT IT IS A SIMPLE PUZZLE WITH 2 WILL IT BECOME TOO UNWIELDY FOR NEWIES TO FOLLOW AT HIGHER COUNTS
I HAVEN'T PLAYED SPLENDOR BUT AM CONSIDERING PURCHASING TO PLAY WITH MY FAMILY DO YOU THINK MY YEAR OLD COULD PLAY AND ENJOY THIS
I'VE BEEN CURIOUS AS TO HOW FUN PLAYING SOLO IS FOR GAMES THAT ARE USUALLY PLAYED BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE EXAMPLES SPACE ALERT ROBINSON CRUSOE SUBURBIA TERRAFORMING MARS ETC I'M ASKING AND MENTIONED THOSE EXAMPLES BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE SHOPPING FOR THOSE GAMES THIS WEEKEND AND PLAN ON MOSTLY PLAYING SOLO SINCE I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYBODY TO PLAY WITH FYI I'M NEW TO THIS TYPE OF BOARD GAMING AND ONLY OWN DOMINION AND PANDEMIC IF THAT HELPS AT ALL
MY FAMILY IS MOSTLY SO THEY DON'T PLAY GAMES OFTEN BUT BANG AND CODENAMES HAVE BOTH BEEN HITS AT OUR RECENT FAMILY PARTIES

AND MY QUESTION WHAT DO YOU DO IN RACE FOR THE GALAXY WHEN THE DRAW PILE RUNS OUT UNLESS I'M MISSING SOMETHING THE RULE BOOK DOESN'T STATE ANYTHING AND A GOOGLE SEARCH JUST FOUND MORE CONFUSED PLAYERS FOR NOW WE'VE BEEN PLAYING TO JUST SHUFFLE BACK THE DISCARDS BUT THAT KIND OF HURTS THE SECURITY THAT COMES FROM DISCARDING YOUR OPPONENT'S IDEAL COST SAFELY
WHERE IS U LAZARUS
IN WONDERS DUEL DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE AN ACTION WITH THE CARD YOU DRAW ON YOUR TURN I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO KEEP IT IN YOUR HAND RATHER THAN BUY IT SELL IT OR USE IT TO BUILD A WONDER BECAUSE I'VE ONLY PLAYED THE GAME ONCE BUT THE RULE BOOK SEEMED UNCLEAR ON THIS POINT AND I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO DO
I JUST PICKED UP PANDEMIC LEGACY FOR MY WIFE AND I TO PLAY I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR THINGS I MIGHT MISS DURING OUR FIRST PLAY AND WHETHER OR NOT TO PLAY AS 2 OR CHARACTERS

WHAT SAY YOU
WONDERS IS IT OKAY FOR SOME PLAYERS TO PLAY THE A SIDE OF THEIR WONDER BOARD AND OTHER PLAYERS PLAY THE B SIDE IN THE SAME GAME IF YOU CAN IS THIS RECOMMENDED OR IS IT TOO IMBALANCE
DUE TO A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL BIRTHMONTH TOGETHER WITH A NOVEMBER I'M SITTING AT UNPLAYED GAMES EXPANSIONS FOR SOME REASON THERE ARE STILL GAMES I WANT TO BUY I BOUGHT GAMES I DON'T EVER THINK I'LL PLAY

HEY EVERYONE I'M NEW TO THE HOBBY AND ENJOYING DECK BUILDERS QUITE A LOT

WHICH EXPANSIONS ARE THE MOST INTERESTING AND UNIQUE FOR ASCENSION AND STAR REALMS WITHOUT THROWING THE BALANCE OFF TO MUCH I HAVE BOTH BASE GAMES WITH NO EXPANSIONS THUS FAR
I'VE PLAYED BANG TWICE THE CARD GAME NOT THE DICE GAME BOTH TIMES I FELT LIKE THE GAME PLAYED ITSELF I COULDN'T SEE ANY REASON TO DO ANYTHING BEYOND ATTACK A PERSON WHO IS NOT ON YOUR TEAM WITHIN RANGE WHO HAS THE LOWEST HEALTH REMAINING EDGE CASE IF YOU'RE A BANDIT AND YOUR PARTNER HAS HEALTH LEFT KILL THEM SO YOU CAN DRAW THE EXTRA CARDS INSTEAD OF LETTING THE OTHER TEAM GET THEM

THE HIDDEN ROLES DON'T SEEM TO COME INTO PLAY MUCH AS THE ROLES CAN'T RISK SHOOTING THE SHERIFF TO DISGUISE THEMSELVES THE EXTRA DAMAGE CAN MEAN THE SHERIFF DIES PREMATURELY AND EVEN IF THEY DON'T THE SHERIFF MIGHT NOW WASTE TIME SHOOTING AN ALLY THE BANDITS SHOULD AVOID SHOOTING EACH OTHER FOR A SIMILAR REASON

ENOUGH PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THIS GAME THAT I FEEL I MUST BE MISSING SOMETHING CAN ANYONE SHARE WITH ME SOME WAYS THAT THE GAME HAS MORE DEPTH THAN I'M SEEING
MY GAME GROUP LOVES COSMIC ENCOUNTER WHAT WOULD BE SOME OTHER GAMES YOU THINK THEY MIGHT LIKE

IS IT OKAY TO PRINT COPIES OF GAMES YOU'VE BOUGHT JUST WONDERING AS I JUST BOUGHT SOME NEW CARD GAMES AND AM WORRIED THEY WILL WEAR OUT OVER TIME

I KNOW CARD GAMES AREN'T THAT EXPENSIVE BUT FOR A STUDENT EVERY IS A LOT EVEN MORE WHEN I SLEEVE THE GAMES

SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TOO MANY AND NOT ENOUGH
ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS I OWN GAMES


GAMES WITHOUT EXPANSIONS THOUGH THIS DOES NOT COUNT DUPLICATES LIKE THE MANY MINIATURES

MINIATURES ARE LIKELY THE COSTLIEST GAME THOUGH PITCHCAR OR ROBO RALLY WOULD BE COSTLY CHOICES

I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON A LIST OF GAMES TO SELL SO HOPEFULLY THE COLLECTION WILL BE A FEW HUNDRED GAMES SMALLER BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR
THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTIONS IS ALWAYS ONE SHY OF REACHING MY PERFECT COLLECTION SIZE

BASE GAMES AND EXPANSIONS

UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T SAY I SCORED ANY AMAZING DISCOUNTS OR FINDS ALMOST ALL WERE FULL PRICE
I OWN ABOUT GAMES WITHOUT EXPANSIONS AND IT'S TOO MANY FOR HOW OFTEN I PLAY OF THAT COUNT I'D SAY ABOUT OF THEM ARE SITTING ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK WAITING TO BE TRADED THOUGH HALF OF THOSE LIKELY WON'T TRADE AT ALL

I PLAYED A LOT OF GAMES BACK WHEN MY COLLECTION WAS GAMES MAYBE A WEEK AT AROUND GAMES WE HAD A BABY AND SUDDENLY OUR GAMING TIME DISAPPEARED I NOW PLAY A LOT OF SOLO GAMES AND MY WIFE AND I DO GAMES DURING NAPTIME ON WEEKENDS DESPITE THIS LACK OF PLAYING MY COLLECTION CONTINUED TO GROW

I'M JUST HOPING THE GAME PLAYING RETURNS AS MY SON NOW TWO YEARS OLD GETS OLDER AND BECOMES MORE INDEPENDENT AND ALSO IF HE TAKES AN INTEREST WHICH HE SEEMS TO BE DEVELOPING ALREADY THEN MY WILL SEEM VALIDATED SOMEHOW

I BUY A LOT OF WARGAMES AND BIG HEAVY EUROS SO FOR A GAME IS NOT UNUSUAL MOST VALUABLE IN MY COLLECTION MAYBE THE GLORY TO ROME BLACK BOX OR PUERTO RICO ANNIVERSARY OR CATAN ANNIVERSARY WOOD BOX I'VE GOT A FEW OTHER OOP TITLES BUT THEY OFTEN COME BACK INTO PRINT EVENTUALLY
I OWN GAMES
MY COLLECTION HOVERS AROUND IS MY CAP IF I WANT A NEW GAME ONE HAS TO GO

HOW MANY GAMES DO YOU OWN

MY MOST PLAYED IS GOT RISK BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY ONE MY FRIENDS WILL BE PATIENT ENOUGH TO LEARN JUST GOT BLOOD RAGE DELIVERED TO MY HOUSE TODAY SO MAYBE I CAN CONVINCE THEM TO PLAY THAT
I LIKE A SMALLER WELL AURATED COLLECTION RATHER THAN WALLS AND WALLS FULL OF GAMES I NEVER PLAY
MY COLLECTION IS SITTING AROUND RIGHT NOW INCLUDING ABOUT EXPANSIONS SPACE IS GETTING TO BE AN ISSUE SO I AM SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING A MAJOR PURGE SOON BEST BARGAIN FIND WAS THE ORIGINAL WARHAMMER QUEST BOARD GAME WITH AN ALL COMPLETE FOR IN A THRIFT STORE A GOOD CHUNK OF MY COLLECTION IS THRIFTIER SO ALL THOSE KIND OF QUALIFY TOO NOTHING STANDS OUT AS A HUGE INVESTMENT ALTHOUGH MY SMALL AND ARMADA COLLECTIONS COST A LOT

MY BEST BARGAIN FIND WAS A COPY OF YACHT RACE WHICH I EVENTUALLY SOLD FOR THAT
RIGHT NOW I HAVE UNIQUE TITLES INCLUDING EXPANSIONS AND PROMOS I'M AT OVER OWNED I'VE DOWNSIZED OVER INCLUDING EXPANSIONS

MY BIGGEST INVESTMENT IS TOUGH SINGLE PURCHASE PROBABLY MY CROKINOLE BOARD COLLECTIVELY NETRUNNER OR DOMINION ALTHOUGH THAT WILL CHANGE WHEN I KICKSTARTER KINGDOM DEATH SINGLE BOARD GAME FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE

BEST DEAL WAS KEY LARGO SEALED FOR OR MAYBE THE FIRST HALF OF NETRUNNER FOR

THE ONLY HOME MADE VERSION I'VE MADE WAS SKULL TO PROVE A POINT
ISH I RARELY BUY EXPANSIONS

BIGGEST INVESTMENT HANDS DOWN IS MYTH STILL NOT SURE IF I WILL BE PLAYING IT
I HAVE THE MOST EXPENSIVE INDIVIDUAL GAME WAS BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL BUT I HAVE VERSIONS OF ASCENSION SO THAT'S MORE I GUESS
MY BG OWNED LIST JUST GREW TO GAMES INCLUDING EXPANSIONS NOT INCLUDING CLASSIC BOARD GAMES RISK MONOPOLY ETC AND FAMILY TYPE GAMES LIFE ALIAS HEADS-UP ETC I STILL GET HARASSED BY PPL IN MY GROUP ABOUT HOW MANY GAMES I HAVE SO MANY BUT THEY'RE PERFECTLY OK COMING OVER TO MY HOUSE AND PLAYING MY GAMES

MY BEST BARGAIN AS A THRIFTIER THE ILLUSION OF PICKING UP A NEW HOBBY GAME FOR SEEMS GREAT BUT YOU END UP PAYING IN GAS AND TIME THAT BEING SAID MY DUNE OR ANY OF THE GAMES I KNOCKED OFF MY WISH LIST ARE HARD TO PIN DOWN AS A BARGAIN

THE SMALL BOX VERSIONS ARE FOR WHEN WE TRAVEL THE REST GET PLAYED MAYBE ONCE PER YEAR AND ARE LIGHTER GAMES THAT WE GOT WHEN WE FIRST GOT INTO THE HOBBY

BIGGEST INVESTMENT WAS PROBABLY LIGNUM WHICH COST ABOUT TO GET SHIPPED WHEN WE GOT IT

BEST BARGAIN WAS PANAMA WHICH WE GOT FOR

BIGGEST INVESTMENT

PROUDEST HOMEMADE VERSION OF AN EXISTING GAME

I'VE PAINTED MINIATURES AND REPLACED COMPONENTS FOR GAMES BUT NOT QUITE SURE THAT COUNTS AS A HOMEMADE VERSION SO REALLY THE ONLY HOMEMADE VERSION GAME I HAVE IS LIAR'S DICE BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY SETS OF EXTRA DICE I EVENTUALLY PUT ASIDE ENOUGH OF THEM IN A DICE BAG TO USE FOR LIAR'S DICE

I OWN ABOUT GAMES AND PNP I MOSTLY PLAY WITH MY SO AND WE RECENTLY DISCOVER A FEW ONLINE BOARDGAMES WEBSITE AND ALSO A BOARDGAMES CAFE THAT HAVE A COLLECTION SO THAT HAS KEPT US FROM PICKING UP NEW GAMES YEARS INTO THE HOBBIES

I OWN IF YOU INCLUDE THOSE ON THE WAY NOT INCLUDING EXPANSIONS IT'S MORE THAN I NEED FEWER THAN I WANT BUT ALSO MORE THAN I REALLY WANT TO HAVE IF I GET RID OF ALL THE GAMES I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY DESIRE TO PLAY I'D PROBABLY BE DOWN TO SOMEWHERE IN THE

MY BIGGEST INVESTMENT WAS EITHER AND EXPANSIONS WARRIOR KNIGHTS W EXPANSION BRUGES W EXPANSION OR MERCHANTS AND MARAUDERS W EXPANSION

MY BEST THRIFT STORE SCORE WAS A LIKE NEW COPY OF POWER GRID WITH THE POWER PLANTS EXPANSION FOR I'VE HAD OTHER NOTABLE ONES SUCH AS CARCASSONNE AROUND THE WORLD IN DAYS AND A FEW OTHERS I'VE HAD A FEW THRIFT STORE MISSES TOO AS I PASSED BY A COPY OF THE ISH VERSION OF SURVIVE

BUT IN MY DEFENCE THERES A LOT OF SMALL GAMES IN THERE DIMMET AND THE LIKE

NO GAME STANDS OOT AS A MAJOR INVESTMENT I THINK THE MOST I'VE SPENT ON A GAME WAS EITHER SCYTHE OR THE BIG BOX OF GALAXY TRUCKERS AND NEITHER OF THEM ARE STILL IN MY COLLECTION

THE BEST BARGAIN THO WAS RA SECOND HAND FOR ITS NOW ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES OF ALL TIME AND LED ME TO GRAB THE OTHER GAMES IN KNIZIAS AUCTION TRILOGY MEDICI AND MODERN ART AND IF THAT DOESNT STRIKE YOU AS A GREAT BARGAIN WELL ITS A GOOD PRICE IN AUSTRALIA THE NEW VERSION IS ABOUT HERE

A DOZEN ABOUT HALF OF WHICH I WOULDN'T REPLACE IF I LOST THEM
TOO MANY I USED TO HAVE A GAME NIGHT EVERY DAY NOW IT DOWN TO A WEEK BUT STILL BUT A LOT OF GAMES IF YOUR LOOKING TO FILL YOUR COLLECTION BARGAIN STORES LIKE T MAXX MARSHALLS ROSS OR ALLIES USUALLY HAVE A FEW BOARD GAMES MY BEST FIND HAS TO BE DOMINION AT GOODWILL FOR
KRESS AN I THOUGHT MY IF YOU COUNT STAND ALONE EXPANSIONS SEPARATELY
BY FAR MY BIGGEST INVESTMENT WOULD BE MY COMPLETE RED DRAGON IN RDF WITH BACKED AND ALL ALLIES AND THE GAMBLING I'M IN DECK


BIGGEST INVESTMENT MACHS VS MINIONS
NO REAL BARGAIN FINDS JUST CHEAPEST PRICES ON AMAZON AT THE TIME
I HAVE NO HOMEMADE GAMES EITHER UNLESS PAINTING MINIS COUNT

PROUDEST HOMEMADE VERSION OF AN EXISTING GAME

I HAVEN'T REALLY DONE ANY FULL HOMEMADE GAMES BUT PROBABLY MY FAVORITE MOD IS MY CUSTOM DELUXE COPY OF KINGSBURG


2 DON'T KNOW PROBABLY SOME GIANT CMON KICKSTARTER ZOMBICIDE ARCADIA QUEST THE OTHERS ETC ALTHOUGH TANTO CHORE BIG BOX WITH ALL EXPANSIONS COSTS QUITE A BIT TOO

WORLD OF SMOG FOR AUD RETAILS FOR

NONE
I'VE GOT AROUND BUT AROUND OF THOSE ARE FILLERS AND SHORT GAMES AND THE REST ARE MIDWEIGHT TO HEAVY EUROS
I LIMIT BY SHELF SPACE BUT THE SHELVES HOLD OVER GAMES

BEST BARGAIN FIND HAS TO BE SHARP SHOOTERS WHICH I BOUGHT AT A THRIFT THINKING THAT A BUCK FIFTY WAS A PRETTY GOOD PRICE FOR A DICE TRAY AND DICE TURNS OUT TO BE MY FAVORITE YAHTZEE VARIANT

I PUT TOGETHER A DATHKADAN SET OF MERCHANT OF VENUS WHICH COST SO MUCH THAT I THINK IT ALSO COUNTS AS MY BIGGEST INVESTMENT
I HAVE ABOUT GAMES THAT INCLUDES 2 EXPANSIONS AND A REPEAT SUSHI GO SUSHI GO PARTY

HONESTLY I ALMOST DON'T LIKE HAVING THAT MANY I WANT TO PHASE IT DOWN BUT I HAVE A WEIRD ATTACHMENT AS WELL BUT I IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER FACET OF MY LIFE LIKE TO SHED WEIGHT IF I DO NOT USE SOMETHING FREQUENTLY

BIGGEST INVESTMENT MARKHAM HORROR GOT THE MAIN GAME UNWITCH HORROR EXPANSION KING IN YELLOW EXPANSION AND DARK PHARAOH EXPANSION BUT I WILL NOT GIVE THOSE GAMES UP I LOVE THEM

BEST BARGAIN FIVE TRIBES AT THE B N SALE GOT IT FOR BUCKINGHAMSHIRE TOTALLY LOVE THATGAME

HOMEMADE VERSION I LOVE THE WARHAMMER UNIVERSE AND FANTASY I ALSO ENJOY D D BUT IT'S HARD TO PLAY SO CURRENTLY I HAVE A BIG BARREL OF ARMY MEN BUT THEY ARE FANTASY VERSION AND PIRATE SKELETONS SO I HAVE ARCHERS DWARVES PIRATES SKELETONS WITCHES AND SO ON SO I AM CREATE A BASIC GAME OF SKILLS AND ROLLS EACH CHARACTER HAS SPECIAL ABILITIES MOVEMENTS ETC IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN REALLY FUN CREATING IT
REALLY WANT TO KEEP IT TO BUT HAVE ABOUT AND EXPANSION LS PROMOS THE PROBLEM IS OUR PLAYER HOUSEHOLD HAS VERY DIVERSE TASTES
I GOT INTO THE HOBBY MAYBE AROUND OR SO

ACCORDING TO MY BG COLLECTION

BIGGEST INVESTMENT DESCENT 2ND EDITION W EXPANSIONS
BEST BARGAIN FIND ARCADIA QUEST FOR SOMETHING LIKE

I DID A PRETTY BIG PURGE TWO OR THREE MONTHS AGO WHEN I MOVED I PROBABLY GOT RID OF A FEW GAMES THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE IMPERIAL ASSAULT BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE A MUCH SMALLER LIST OF GAMES I GOT RID OF A BUNCH OF GAMES I NEVER PLAYED OR JUST DIDN'T LIKE NOW I'M BASICALLY AT THE POINT WHERE I KEEP MATH TRADING ONES I DON'T CARE TOO MUCH FOR UNTIL I GET ONE I DO WANT

HERE ARE A FEW OTHER STATS

MY MOST PLAYED GAME IS ARCADIA QUEST
MY CURRENT FAVORITE GAME IS ARCADIA QUEST
MY MOST REGRETTED PURCHASE IS TWILIGHT IMPERIUM
IN MY MOST RECENT MATH TRADE I TRADED MYSTIC VALE FOR DEAD OF WINTER
MY MOST RECENT PURCHASE WAS SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE
MY NEXT PLANNED PURCHASE IS KINGDOM DEATH MONSTERS ON BLACK FRIDAY
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I BOUGHT OUR FIRST FEW BOARD GAMES ON SEPTEMBER TWO MONTHS LATER AS OF TODAY WE ALREADY HAVE GAMES

I THINK WE ARE SUFFERING FROM SOME NEWBIE SYNDROME

EDIT FORGOT TO MENTION WE HAVE 2 GAMES SHIPPING AND AROUND GAMES WE ARE PLANNING TO BUY WITHIN A WEEK WHEN MY FAGS GOES ON SALE
HONESTLY TOO MANY I'M NOT GOING TO COUNT THEM ALL RIGHT NOW BUT PROBABLY I CAN PROBABLY GET OF THEM TO THE TABLE IF I REALLY WANTED TOO THOUGH THERE ARE ABOUT A DOZEN DOZEN HEX AND COUNTER WAR GAMES THAT I NEED TO LEARN AND ARE VIABLE
ABOUT FORTY WITH MAYBE TEN EXPANSIONS I'VE NOTICED THAT MY BUYING OF BOARD GAMES HAS STARTED TO PLATEAU NOW THAT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENOUGH DIVERSITY TO SUIT MOST OCCASIONS

BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN TOTAL IS DOMINION WHICH IS AMUSING CONSIDERING HOW OVER THAT GAME I AM SINGLE PURCHASE WOULD BE TALES OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
GAMES AFTER 2 YEAR IN THE HOBBY I HAVE SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY OVER THE PAST YEAR BOUGHT ONLY GAMES I'M AIMING TO GET MAX GAMES PER YEAR

REASON IS THE INDUSTRY IS BLOOMING WE CAN FORESEE MANY BETTER GAMES WITH GREAT ART AND COMPONENTS AS PUBLISHERS HAVE BETTER BUDGET FOR EACH GAME

THAT'S WHY I HAVE DECIDED TO STOP BUYING GAMES WHICH ARE MORE THAN A FEW YEARS BACK RATHER THAN PLAY CATCH UP TO BUY GOOD GAMES THATS BEEN RELEASED OVER THE PAST YEARS I KNOW THIS COMING FEW YEARS WILL HAVE EVEN BETTER GAMES SO IM SAVING SPACE AND MONEY FOR FUTURE
I SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVE TOO MANY YET NOT ENOUGH
OVER WITH AWING EXPANSIONS
ACCORDING TO BG GAMES NOT COUNTING EXPANSIONS

WITH EXPANSIONS BUT THAT ALSO INCLUDES JUST ABOUT EVERY CH EXPANSION AND A TON OF SHIPS
HOW MANY GAMES DO YOU OWN

BIGGEST INVESTMENT USD
BEST BARGAIN IOS FREE PERIOD
PROUDEST HOMEMADE NONE
BG SAYS UNIQUE GAMES BUT THAT'S PROBABLY A FEW SHORT IN EITHER DIRECTION EXPANSIONS I'M NOT A FAN
MOST EXPENSIVE YOU MEAN THAT'S A THREE WAY TIE TRIUMPH PUERTO RICO LIMITED ANNIVERSARY EDITION AND ANTIQUITY ALL COST ME
I GET LOTS OF GAMES DONATED TO ME BECAUSE I RUN A LARGE GAME NIGHT WITH A PUBLIC LIBRARY
INDONESIA THOUGH MY CUSTOM BUS IS ALSO PRETTY NEAT
MY COLLECTION IS CURRENTLY GAMES WITH ONLY 2 EXPANSIONS BUT I HAVE ACCESS TO A MUCH WIDER VARIETY OF GAMES THROUGH MY GAME GROUP SO THERE'S NOT NEED FOR ME TO BUY AS MANY IF I INCLUDE GAMES I'VE PLAYED BELONGING TO OTHERS IT JUMPS TO

BIGGEST INVESTMENT IS PROBABLY THE MINIATURES GAME IT'S NOT MUCH COMPARED TO SOME BUT I'D SAY ITS COMING UP ON

DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY BEST BARGAIN I PICKED UP SKULL FOR HALF PRICE AND ITS GOTTEN A LOT OF PLAY SAME WITH RHINO HERO WHICH COST ON AMAZON I GUESS PICKING UP VIA NEBULA FOR NOT TOO LONG AGO WAS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL BUT I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY IT YET

EDIT I MADE A SMALL BIT IF EFFORT WITH MY DEEP SPACE D PRINT AND PLAY IT LOOKS FINE I DON'T THINK I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THE LAST QUESTION LAST YEAR I MADE A CHRISTMAS OF THE RESISTANCE AVALON WITH ONE TEAM BEING SANTA MERLIN AND THE ELVES WITH THE OTHER TEAM BEING THE GRINCH GRAMPUS ETC BUT IT LOOKED KIND OF CRAP AS IT WAS ALL FREE ART I FOUND ONLINE AND IT NEVER GOT PLAYED
ONLY WHICH IS MACHS VS MINIONS I WOULD LIKE TO BUY SOME OTHER GAMES LIKE PANDEMIC LEGACY OR GLOOMHAVEN BUT UNFORTUNATELY MY FRIENDS DON'T HAVE FREE TIME TOGETHER ONE FRIENDS WORKS IN THE WEEKDAYS AND THE OTHER ONE HAS ONLY TIME IN THE WEEKDAYS WE ONLY GOT TO THE SECOND MISSION AND WE HAD A TON OF FUN DOING THAT BUT THAT WAS A FEW WEEKS AGO AND WE STILL COULDN'T FIND A TIME WHERE WE CAN MEET UP AGAIN
I'M AT I'LL BE AT BY THE NEW YEAR THERE'S ABOUT SITTING IN MY OFFICE THAT NEED TO BE SOLD TRADED THOUGH
I HAVE AROUND GAMES AND I'M HOLDING MYSELF NOT TO BUY ANY MORE UNTIL A COUPLE OF THEM HAVE MORE PLAYS IT'S SO EASY TO BE TEMPTED TO BUY EVERYTHING I HAVE A BIG WISELIEST WITH GAMES LIKE LISBOA TERRAFORMING MARS VITICULTURE EE ISTANBUL AND SO MANY OTHERS BUT I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY REMIND MYSELF THAT MY CURRENT GAMES AREN'T GETTING PLAYED ANYWAY SO BUYING NEW ONES IS NOT IDEAL

MY BIGGEST INVESTMENT HAS BEEN SCYTHE EUROS THE GAME EUROS FOR RESOURCES EUROS FOR METAL COINS EUROS IN PROMOS EUROS FOR THE EXPANSION CONSIDERING GETTING THE BROKEN TOKEN INSERT

I HAVEN'T CAUGHT A GREAT BARGAIN I BUY MOST MY GAMES NEW FROM STORES I GUESS THE BEST WOULD BE JAIPUR FOR EUROS WHICH WAS THE ONE GAME I BOUGHT FROM A PREVIOUS OWNER
GAMES PLUS EXPANSIONS TOTALING TO

BIGGEST INVESTMENT IS LEGENDARY MARVEL VILLAINS GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY PAINT THE TOWN RED ALIENS

BEST BARGAIN FIND IS HARD TO TELL I GOT DOMINION FOR USED HIGHEST BG RATING FOR MONEY I TRADED A DAMAGED COPY OF SEASONS FOR A LIKE NEW COPY OF ARCADIA QUEST AND I GOT LOTS AND LOTS OF GOOD GAMES FOR OR THREE FOR AT SPIEL IN ESSEN IN THE LAST YEARS

PROUDEST HOMEMADE VERSION OF AN EXISTING GAME

MY NOW FIANCE ONCE MADE ME A MONOPOLY GAME WITH THE AARP BARONY WE PLAYED IN THAT CAN BE PLAYED IN CHARACTER
AROUND
AROUND FOR VARIOUS KICKSTARTERS INCLUDING I THINK MOST FOR A SINGLE GAME WAS AROUND I HAVE MYTH CONAN AND DEADZONE WHICH I THINK ALL WERE AROUND THAT PRICE POINT BEFORE
THROUGH THE AGES IN SHRINK FOR KR AROUND ALSO I RECENTLY GOT TWILIGHT IMPERIUM 2ND ED AND DESCENT 1ST EDITION MINUS HEROES AND A COUPLE OF MONSTERS FOR FREE WHEN I PURCHASED A USED COPY OF RAMPAGE NOW TERROR IN STEEPLE CITY FOR KR
DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY HOMEMADE COPIES
I'M PROBABLY AT AROUND MAIN GAMES EXPANSIONS

THE MOST I SPENT ON A SINGLE GAME OFF OF KICKSTARTER WAS MACHS AND MINIONS AT ON KICKSTARTER NOT MUCH HIGHER TSH ANACHRACY MAYBE

BEST BARGAIN WAS PROBABLY A COMPLETE CYCLADES FOR AT A UK GAMES EXPO AIA FOR IS UP THERE THOUGH

BEST RETURN ON AN INVESTMENT FOR ME THOUGH IS PROBABLY DISCWORLD DEFLUX EDITION BOUGHT FOR NOW SELLABLE FOR

I DON'T LOOK FOR MANY GAMES THESE DAYS I HAVE A LIST I'D LIKE TO HAVE GLORY TO ROME BLACK BOX FOR EXAMPLE HIGH ON MY WISELIEST BUT I'VE RUN OUT OF ROOM WITH 2 KIDS AND NEEDED TO SLOW DOWN
CURRENTLY JUST A COUPLE OF THE GAMES WITH MINIATURES EAST G SPACE HULK WERE AROUND DON'T THINK I EVER GOT A GOOD BARGAIN BUT I DID GET NEW ENGLAND AS A FREE DOOR PRIZE AND AS A GIFT AND ALL OF MY HOMEMADE GAMES WERE GAMES I CREATED MYSELF THOUGH I GUESS I DO HAVE A HOMEMADE VERSION OF GO


ROUGHLY GAMES WITH AROUND EXPANSIONS TO VARIOUS DEGREES I GET INTO MY PRIMARY HOBBIES PRETTY SERIOUSLY THE BULK OF THE COLLECTION HAS CROSSED CONTINENTS TWICE AND SURVIVED BUT IT DEFINITELY CUTS INTO MY ABILITY TO RELOCATE I GENERALLY ONLY ADD NEW GAMES BY CHECKING THE BG TOP FOR NEW ENTRIES OR BY BUYING EXPANSIONS TO CURRENT GAMES I LIKE OR FROM VERY SELECT DESIGNERS

THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT HAS BEEN WAR OF THE RING COLLECTOR'S EDITION FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE SMALL WORLD DESIGNER'S EDITION BOTH WORTH EVERY PENNY AND I KEEP AN ACTIVE EYE OUT FOR THESE GAMES

THE BEST BARGAIN FIND WAS A COPY OF DUNE FOR AT A GARAGE SALE BEST BARGAIN MISSED WAS A COPY OF STAR WARS QUEEN'S GAMBIT FOR AT THE LOCAL GAME STORE CAME BACK A WEEK LATER AND IT WAS GONE

UNFORTUNATELY I HAVEN'T TRIED A HOMEMADE VERSION YET ALTHOUGH I'VE REPLICATED CODENAMES FOR AN OFFICE EVENT WITH A FEW SCRAPS OF PAPER
NOT ENOUGH FOR ME MORE THAN ENOUGH ACCORDING TO MY WIFE
ABOUT I HAVE TWO EXTRA TEAMS FOR NEUROSHIMA HEX SO I GUESS IT'S WHAT I'M MOST INVESTED IN
ABOUT

ROADS AND BOATS COST

MODERN ART I GOT FOR WHICH IS THE BEST BARGAIN STILL IN THE COLLECTION I BOUGHT STARCRAFT NIS FOR BUT SOLD IT OFFICIAL ALSO A FEW OTHER RARE CHARITY SHOP FINES THAT GOT SOLD OFFICIAL

PROUDEST HOMEMADE MAYBE MY HARD-DRAWN COPY OF FJORDS OR MY CLOTH MAP FOR CHICAGO EXPRESS

I'M SITTING AT NOT INCLUDING EXPANSIONS MY LARGEST INVESTMENT IS MY CARROM BOARD OR AT LEAST I ASSUME SO IT WAS A GIFT MY BEST BARGAIN FIND IS MIKAL AT GOODWILL ALTHOUGH I ALSO HAVE A FEW BAND SETS AS WELL

I DON'T HAVE ANY PRINT AND PLAY STUFF THE MOST TREASURED GAME IN MY COLLECTION IS THE REALLY NASTY HORSEDRAWING GAME AS IT WAS MY FIRST STEP INTO HOBBY GAMING AND SPECIAL ORDERED FROM THE UK A NICE BIG RED BOX WITH SOME WONDERFUL PLASTIC HORSES THERE'S SOMETHING MAGICAL ABOUT A GAME THAT LETS YOU BET THE HOUSE THAT YOU'LL LOSE THE RACE
CURRENTLY OWN GAMES NOT INCLUDING EXPANSIONS TRYING TO DITCH SIX OF THEM GOING TO TRY AND STICK TO GAMES THERE'S A MATH TRADE COMING UP THAT WILL HOPEFULLY RID ME OF GAMES

BIGGEST INVESTMENT BOUGHT ANTIQUITY USED FOR CURRENTLY TRYING TO GET ALL THE PLOTTER GAMES

BEST BARGAIN MY ESSEN COPY OF AMERICAN RAILS I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A BARGAIN BUT I GOT IT AND THAT TO ME SEEMED LIKE A STEAL
MANY GAMES
I RECENTLY BOUGHT MY YEAR OLD NIECE A COPY OF TICKET TO RIDE IT'S AN EXCELLENT GATEWAY GAME THAT WILL TEACH HER STRATEGIC TACTICAL THINKING AND SOME US GEOGRAPHY AS WELL
OCEANO LOTUS KINGDOMINO ARUBA QUADROPOLIS FOR NEW GAMES ALHAMBRA TICKET TO RIDE PATCHWORK OR QWIRKLE FOR OLDER GAMES DOES SHE HAVE ANY INTERESTS RIGHT NOW THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD THEME TIE IN
I'VE TWO KIDS AND AND OF ALL THE STUFF WE HAVE THEY SEEM TO LIKE CLUED THE BEST

WE ALSO PLAY SERVICE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS A FAIR BIT
KING OF TOKYO ROBORALLY OR SETTLERS OF CATAN
MY DAUGHTERS INCLUDING THE YOUNGEST AROUND THAT AGE ALL LOVED ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF SUSHI GO AND FORBIDDEN ISLAND
PLAYED A FEW TIMES NOW AND IT IS A GREAT GAME IMHO WORTH THE HYPE

STILL RISING UP THROUGH THE RANKING AT BG TOO CURRENTLY IN TERMS OF OVERALL RANK
PLAYED IT TIMES SO FAR SINCE I GOT IT LAST MONTH ALL SOLO CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY WITH MORE BUT IT IS STILL EASILY IN THE RUNNING FOR BEST GAME I'VE PLAYED ALL YEAR SUPER SATISFYING WHEN YOU CAN WIN AND EVEN WHEN YOU FALL SHORT IT PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE
I PLAYED IT AND TAUGHT IT SEVERAL TIMES AT BG I LIKE IT A LOT IT'S A VERY INTERESTING THEME AND THERE ARE MANY POTENTIAL STRATEGIES TO GET APS AND WIN THE GAME IT KILLS TERA MYSTIC FOR ME
I AM SUPER EXCITED TO GET IT NEXT YEAR WHEN I CAN PAY A REASONABLE PRICE FOR IT I JUST REFUSE TO PAY BLOATED RESELLER PRICES FOR THE NEW HOTNESS IT'S SOMETHING I REALLY DISLIKE ABOUT THIS GREAT HOBBY
IT HAS A TAKE THAT MECHANISM AND YEAH THAT'S A HARD PASS MOST TIMES FOR ME
IN A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT GAME WHERE EVERY BIT CAN MATTER IT'S AN EVEN HARDER PASSIVE
PLAYED ONCE WITH THE STARTER CORPORATIONS AND HAD A BLAST WE DID NOT GET ANYWHERE NEAR FILLING MARS LIKE THE IMAGE IN THIS REVIEW BUT AREN'T THE SPOTS RESERVED FOR WATER ILLEGAL PLACEMENTS FOR OTHER TILES I THOUGHT THERE WERE MORE SPOTS THAN WATER TILES
I AGREE WITH THIS GLOWING REVIEW BUT I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT SOMEONE ONLY PLAYING THE GAME TWICE AND WRITING A REVIEW SHOULDN'T IT BE PLAYED MORE TO GET A SPOT ON G S SO THE REVIEW CAN GO INTO MORE DEPTH
ANYBODY HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE PLAYING IT WITH ONLY TWO PLAYERS I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW WELL IT SCALES BETWEEN ALL PLAYER COUNTS
WE'VE ONLY PLAYED IT ONCE BUT IT WAS PRETTY POPULAR WITH MY PLAYGROUND
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO GET MY HANDS ON THIS I DID FIND ONE COPY AT A FAGS FOR PROBABLY GONNA JUST WAIT UNTIL JAN FEB THOUGH TO SAVE
LOTS OF LOVE FOR THIS GAME
LOVE THIS GAME
DIDNT REALLY DO IT FOR ME BUT I ONLY PLAYED ONCE OF US JUST READING OUR OWN CARDS ADJUSTING PRODUCTION LEVELS UP AND DOWN I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE THEME ALTHOUGH THE SLIGHTLY DODGY ART DIDNT HELP SOMETIMES JUST NOT MY THING I GUESS
ANY WORD ON THE REPRINT IN THE US
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING HE COMPARED IT TO THE MARS TRILOGY

I RED RDS OF RED MARS BEFORE I GAVE UP I THOUGHT IT WAS A DREADFULLY BORING BOOK WITH ZERO INTERESTING CHARACTERS NOTHING INTERESTING AT ALL HAPPENED ALL THE CHARACTERS WERE TWO DIMENSIONAL AND I FRANKLY COULDN'T EVEN KEEP THEM STRAIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL JUST SO BORING UGH WHAT A TERRIBLE BOOK

AT ANY RATE IS THE GAME REALLY BASED OFF THAT SERIES OR WAS IT SIMPLY INSPIRATION FOR THE BOOK NOT THAT IT REALLY MATTERS I HEAR THE GAME IS TERRIFIC FROM A FEW DIFFERENT SOURCES SO I WILL MOST LIKELY PICK IT UP AT SOME POINT

I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE GAME BEFORE RELEASE GLAD TO HEAR ITS GONE DOWN WELL I THINK I WILL WAIT FOR THE RE PRINT IN THE HOPE THEY IMPROVE SOME OF THE COMPONENTS AS I HEARD THEY ARE A BIT LACKLUSTRE
I LIKED THE CARD PLAY BUT THE MILESTONES AWARDS PUT ME OFF THE GAME A BIT THEY'RE KINDA BANKY ADDITIONS

A VERSION OF THE GAME WITH VARIABLE AWARDS OBJECTIVES WHERE SOME OR ALL OF THEM ARE FIXED FROM THE START RATHER THAN NEEDING TO BE ACTIVATED WOULD BE FANTASTIC FOR ME
THIS SYSTEMS LOOKS SUPER FUN BUT HONESTLY THE GRAPHIC DESIGN OF THIS GAME COMPLETELY PUTS ME OFF WHEN I SAW THE HACKER CARD ON SU POST OF IT ON THEIR BLOG THAT WAS RELEASED TODAY YESTERDAY I ALMOST COMPLETELY PUT THIS ON MY PASS LIST
ORGANISED PLAY SOUNDS LIKE A BORING PLAY DATE YOUR MUM ORGANISES WITH THE BORING KID NEXT DOOR
I STRONGLY SUGGEST EMET

FIRST OFF THE COMBAT IS EXCELLENT AND THE GAME REWARDS BEING OFFENSIVE OVER DEFENSIVE IN MANY WAYS THE COMBAT IS NOT RANDOM INSTEAD EACH PLAYER STARTS WITH THE SAME IDENTICAL HAND OF CARDS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF ATTACK SHIELD AND KILL EACH TIME YOU GO INTO COMBAT UP CHOOSE A CARD SECRETLY AND DISCARD ANOTHER SO YOU'LL HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON WHAT YOUR OPPONENT STILL HAS AVAILABLE

YOU'LL ALSO HAVE SOME SITUATIONS WHERE YOU KNOW THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD YOUR TERRITORY BUT THAT YOU CAN GAIN MORE BY KILLING A BUNCH OF YOUR OPPONENTS ARMIES OR YOU MAY KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE BUT YOU WANT TO SHIELD YOUR MEN AND COME BACK TO ATTACK ON YOUR NEXT TURN

IT ALSO HAS AN INTERESTING ASPECT OF BUILDING UP TECHNOLOGIES THAT GIVE YOU SPECIAL POWERS OR BREAK OTHER RULES

FINALLY IN TERMS OF A GIFT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL GAME IT'S EGYPTIAN THEMED AND JUST BEAUTIFUL THE ART IS GORGEOUS THE BOARD THE MINIS EVERYTHING IT WOULD BE AN IMPRESSIVE GIFT IN ADDITION THE RULES ARE SIMPLE AND CONSISTENT SO IF HE HAD NOT PLAYED MANY HOBBY BOARD GAMES THE RULES ARE NOT AT ALL INTIMATING
RISK LEGACY ESPECIALLY IF YOU'D HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROMISE TO PLAY IT THROUGH WITH HIM

SPHERES OF INFLUENCE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY BETTER RISK

COMBAT COMMANDER EUROPE IF HE LIKES RISK BECAUSE HE LIKES WARFARE MILITARY IN GENERAL HE MAY ENJOY THIS THIS WOULD BE THE DEEPEST OF THE SUGGESTED GAMES SO BOTH MORE INTIMIDATING BUT POTENTIALLY MORE REWARDING FOR HIM I BELIEVE IT HAS A SOLO MODE TOO IF THAT WOULD BE RELEVANT
NEXUS OPS IS A VERY FUN RELATIVELY QUICK COMBAT FOCUSED STRATEGY GAME YOU DON'T WIN BY HOLDING TERRITORY BUT BY WINNING BATTLES THAT YOU'VE STARTED SO IT REALLY PUSHES CONSTANT FIGHTING AND AGGRESSIVE PLAY FRETTY SIMPLE AND VERY WELL BALANCED WITH SOME GOOD CATCHUP MECHANICS
MY FAVORITE LIGHTER DUDES ON A MAP GAME SIMILAR TO RISK IS NEXUS OPS IT'S SHORT AND BRUTAL AND I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED IT EVEN WHEN LOSING

IF YOU THINK HE'D WANT SOMETHING LONGER TO HELL WITH THAT CONQUER THE WORLD VIBE THEN I'D GO WITH SHOGUN SAMURAI SWORDS ITUSA NAME DEPENDS ON THE EDITION YOU GET IT'S CURRENTLY ITUSA THIS ONE TAKES THE IDEA OF THE DEATH BALL FROM RISK AND FORMALIZES IT INTO ARMIES SO YOU HAVE A GENERAL MOVING AROUND THE BOARD AND THEN A PLAYER BOARD THAT SHOWS THE ARMY THAT GUY IS TOTING AROUND AS THEY WIN BATTLES THEY CAN MOVE MORE TIMES IN ONE ROUND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER DIFFERENCES BUT THAT'S THE BIG ONE IMO
I'LL 2ND THE EMET AND SMALL WORLD SUGGESTIONS SLIGHTLY LEANING SMALL WORLDS IF FANTASY THEME IS OKAY
WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND A GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME SECOND EDITION
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A BETTER RISK WITH A GAME OF THRONES FLAVOUR TO IT KNOWING THE GAME OF THRONES STORY IS NOT NECESSARY AS THE GAME ITSELF IS EXTREMELY FUN AND PLAYS WELL WITH PLAYERS IT ALSO HAS THE OPTION TO REMOVE A LOT OF THE LUCK OF RISKS AND MAKE IT VERY SKILLFUL AND MECHANICAL OR KEEP THE LUCK OF RISK WITH THE TIDES OF BATTLE CARDS
CHECK OUT R AGOTBOARDGAME
SMALL WORLD IS A GREAT GAME IT IS A STRATEGIC AREA CONTROL GAME LIKE RISK BUT IS OTHERWISE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IT IS A MUCH FASTER MOVING GAME EVEN THOUGH THE RULES ARE MORE COMPLEX AND IS IN MY OPINION A BETTER GAME THAN RISK THE CARTOON NATURE OF THE ARTWORK MIGHT TURN HIM OFF FOR APPEARING TOO JUVENILE IF YOU CAN GET HIM TO PLAY A FEW GAMES TO THE POINT WHERE HE UNDERSTANDS THE STRATEGY OF BALANCING ONE ACTIVE AND ONE IN DECLINE RACE IT COULD BE A HUGE SUCCESS I FEEL LIKE SMALL WORLD IS A GREAT STEPPING STONE INTO BETTER QUALITY BOARD GAMES THAN MASS MARKET STUFF
I WOULD CONCUR WITH YOUR DECISION TO PROCEED TO SMALL WORLD I MOVED MY FAMILY ONTO IT AND IT WAS A BIG HIT
SOMEONE ELSE ALREADY SAID IT BUT ITUSA
AXIS AND ALLIES IS MY SUGGESTION IF HE WANTS SOMETHING MUCH HEAVIER WHILE STILL PLAYING SOMETHING ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE RISK
MAYBE MEMOIR WOULD FIT THE BILL
DDK WHAT DOES HE SEEM TO LIKE ABOUT BOTH DOES HE HAVE ANY OTHER GAMES HOW INTO THE HOBBY IS HE ANY OTHER DETAILS AT ALL

MY INITIAL RESPONSE WAS MEMOIR FOR SOMETHING BETWEEN FULL ON CONFLICT LOGISTICS AND RISK LIGHT STRATEGY DICE CHUCKING AND MODERN REALISTIC THEMING
IMPERIAL OR THE NEWER IMPERIAL IS PROBABLY A SMALLER STEP FROM RISK THAN SMALLSWORD BUT STILL ADDS ENOUGH STRATEGY DEPTH TO BE INTERESTING SMALLSWORD THOUGH HAS SOME RANDOM BITS OF SETUP THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ADD TO REPLACEABILITY
WARRIOR KNIGHTS IS A GREAT MULTIPLAYER STRATEGY GAME WITH SOME INTERESTING EURO ELEMENTS EACH TURN HAS FOUR SEASONS AT THE START OF EACH TURN YOU PICK SOME ORDER CARDS WHICH HAVE THINGS LIKE GATHER TAXES MOVE ARMIES GAIN RELIGIOUS POWER ETC AND ASSIGN TWO TO EACH SEASON ALL PLAYERS CARDS FOR EACH SEASON GET SHUFFLED AND YOU END UP WITH FOUR DECKS OF CARDS SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE DOING EACH SEASON BUT NOT THE ORDER AND NOT WHO IS GOING FIRST

IT REALLY GETS YOU TO THINK AHEAD AND BE FLEXIBLE
RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT A LOT OF GOOD DUDES ON A MAP GAMES TO LOOK AT I'VE HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT CRY HAVOC AND BLOOD RAGE I PERSONALLY LOVE ANIS EMET IS GREAT IF YOU PLAY RISK LEGACY I'M SURE YOU'LL WIN SOME GOOD BOYFRIEND POINTS WITH HIM
GOING A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE OTHER RESPONSES I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND EIGHT MINUTE EMPIRE LEGENDS I OFTEN CHARACTERIZE THIS GAME AS EXCEPT FUN WHEN INTRODUCING TO NEW PLAYERS FOR ME AT LEAST IT GIVES THAT LAND GRABBING FEELING BUT YOU CAN PLAY IT IN HALF AN HOUR AND IT DOESN'T EAT UP AN ENTIRE TABLE AND A YOU COMBINE THOSE TWO THINGS SOMETHING REMARKABLE HAPPENS THAT NEVER DID FOR ME WITH RISK YOU CAN GET PEOPLE TO AGREE TO PLAY IT WITH YOU
GROUP THERAPY
QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ESPECIAL IF HE LIKES WW2
FORBIDDEN STARS IS A REALLY ENJOYABLE STRATEGY CAPTURE THE FLAG IN SPACE IT IS ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE THOUGH THE RULES ARE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD ALTHOUGH COMBAT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF WORKING OUT PLAYS WELL WITH PLAYERS
RISK IS FANTASTIC MANY SEEM TO CONSIDER IT THE BEST ITERATION
SORRY BUT A LOT OF THESE ARE BAD SUGGESTIONS IT SOUNDS LIKE HE IS INTERESTED IN STRATEGY GAMES BUT PROBABLY DOESN'T HAVE LOTS OF EXPERIENCE CONFLICT LOOKS PRETTY SIMPLE AND SO IS RISK SOME OF THESE GAMES BEING SUGGESTED ARE PRETTY BIG JUMPS IN COMPLEXITY FOR INEXPERIENCED GAMERS THOUGH MY DAD WOULD PLAY RISK BUT HE WOULD NEVER PLAY EMET FOR INSTANCE

SMALL WORLD MIGHT WORK ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A GAMER AND CAN HELP IT ALONG HOW ABOUT RISK EUROPE THOUGH IT'S GETTING GREAT REVIEWS AND CAN ACTUALLY PLAY QUITE WELL AT 2 AND PLAYERS STAR WARS RISK IS ANOTHER GREAT GAME BUT ONLY PLAYS 2 PLAYER AND THE THEME MAY OR MAY NOT WORK FOR HIM BOTH THOSE GAMES ARE FAIRLY EASY AND ARE BARELY RISK GAMES RISK IS REALLY ONLY IN THE TITLE FOR MARKETING PURPOSES I IMAGINE

MY COPY OF TRAJAN ARRIVED YESTERDAY AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH
WE POPPED INTO OUR LOCAL GAME SHOP LAST WEEK TO SEE IF OUR ORDER OF MEMOIR HAD ARRIVED YET IT HADN'T BUT GALAXY TRUCKER WINKED AT US FROM THE SHELF COULDN'T RESIST ITS CHARM AND WOW IT IS SO MUCH FUN
THE MOST RECENT ONE I'VE PLAYED IS INNOVATION AND I'M REALLY LIKING IT
TERRAFORMING MARS IT'S GOT PLENTY OF FLAWS BUT AS A GAME TO PLAY WITH THE WIFE I EAST JUST FOR THE TABLE TIME TOGETHER AND NOT FOR ANY DEEPLY STRATEGIC EXPERIENCE IT IS A DECENT ENOUGH GAME
MARKHAM HORROR CG ABSOLUTELY LOVING IT SO FAR MY PARTNER AND I PLAYED THE FIRST SCENARIO AS A STAND ALONE THEN ONCE THROUGH THE FULL CAMPAIGN WITH DIFFERENT INVESTIGATORS THE ONLY MINOR DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THAT THINGS DIDN'T REALLY GO WELL THROUGHOUT AND THE THIRD SCENARIO BEAT US UP SO BADLY AND WE GOT SUCH BAD LUCK THAT WE DIED BEFORE ANYTHING INTERESTING HAD REALLY HAPPENED I'M HOPING WE'LL COPE A BIT BETTER THE NEXT TIME AROUND AND GET TO SEE A BIT MORE OF WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT

OH MY GOODS A REALLY NEAT LITTLE CARD GAME WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF HIDDEN DEPTH DUE TO THE MULTIPLE CARD USES IT FEELS JUST A LITTLE TOO LUCK DRIVEN TO BE A CLASSIC AND I DON'T QUITE GET THE FEELING THAT'LL ENTIRELY BALANCE OUT WITH EXPERIENCE BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP IT BEING A LOT OF FUN TO PLAY
I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET BUT MANAGED TO SNAG A COPY OF ROLL FOR THE GALAXY FOR 2 AT BARNES AND NOBLE SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING IT THE CASHIER GIRL WAS IMPRESSED THAT A BOX WITH THAT MUCH PRODUCT WAS ON SALE

I DON'T GET TO PLAY GAMES NEARLY AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE SO I'M ALSO STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING MY COPY OF DEAD OF WINTER THE LONG NIGHT I GRABBED ON SALE AND MY KICKSTARTER COPY OF THE NETWORKS HOPEFULLY I CAN STRONG-ARM SOME PEOPLE INTO PLAYING AROUND THE HOLIDAYS

A RECENT PURCHASE THAT I DID MANAGE TO PLAY WAS BONANZA AND IT DEFINITELY DELIVERED I STUDIED THE GAME FOR A WHILE SO I WAS ABLE TO MANAGE THE UNINTUITIVE RULE SET WITH TWO GROUPS OF VASTLY DIFFERENT GAMING EXPERIENCE LEVELS ALL ENJOYED DEALING SOME BEANS I'M GLAD I HAVE IT FOR SURE
CODENAMES COULDN'T RESIST WHEN IT WAS SOLD FOR ON AMAZON I PLAYED IT BEFORE SO I KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT HAVEN'T UNPACKED MY OWN COPY YET
LAST WEEKEND I SNAPPED UP A BUNCH OF GAMES FROM A AGS THAT'S GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SAD FACE HERE'S WHAT I GOT

DOMINION INTRIGUE 2ND ED HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET I LOVE DOMINION THOUGH

MACHI BORO THE HARBOR EXPANSION JUST PLAYED THIS LAST NIGHT ALSO WITH THE MILLIONAIRE'S ROW EXPANSION WHICH I ALREADY HAD I ENJOYED IT

TICKET TO RIDE NORDIC COUNTIES I'VE PLAYED THE ORIGINAL SO MANY TIMES I'VE LOST COUNT I LIKED GETTING TO PLAY ON A DIFFERENT MAP WITH SOME DIFFERENT MECHANICS FOR A CHANGE

NEXUS OPS IT WAS FUN I DON'T OWN MUCH IN THE WAY OF WAR GAMES SO IT'S A NICE ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION

ASHES RISE OF THE PHOENIXBORN HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS ONE YET EITHER BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A NEAT CG LOVE THE ARTWORK


CAPTAIN SONAR BUT I LITERALLY JUST PURCHASED WHEN IT WHEN IN STOCK ON CSI THIS MORNING SO I DON'T HAVE IT YET BUT I'M ALREADY PLANNING THE GAME NIGHT FOR IT
I BOUGHT YINS ABOUT A MONTH AGO IT'S PROBABLY MY FAVORITE OR SECOND FAVORITE BOARD GAME DEPENDING ON HOW I'M FEELING THAT DAY TEACHING THIS GAME IS REALLY EASY AS ARE MOST ABSTRACT STRATEGIES BUT THE DEPTH OF THIS GAME IS VEILED BY ITS SIMPLE CONCEPT I'VE PUT IN ABOUT OR PLAYS AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS SATISFYING EVERY TIME I LOSE I CAN REMEMBER THE THINGS I DONE DIFFERENTLY AND APPLY THAT KNOWLEDGE TO THE GAMES I PLAY LATER I CONSIDER MYSELF EXTREMELY FORTUNATE THAT I HAVE IT IN MY COLLECTION
THE GREAT WESTERN TRAIL PLAYED A FRIEND'S COPY ON MONDAY BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY

I DIDN'T EXPECT MUCH GOING INTO IT AND WE PLAYED THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME HORRIBLY WRONG SKIPPING THE FILL YOUR HAND AT THE END OF EACH TURN PHASE MAKES THE GAME PRETTY DIFFICULT AFTER WE CORRECTED THAT THINGS CLICKED AND BOTH ME AND THE WIFE LOVED IT
I JUST PURCHASED AN OLD COPY OF HERTZ IT SITS ON MY SHELF UNPLAYED
I PICKED UP A COPY OF VIA NEBULA ABOUT WEEKS AGO BUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT TO THE TABLE YET THE RULES SEEM STRAIGHT FORWARD ENOUGH BUT WORK OVERTIME AND SOME WEEKEND WORKING REALLY ATE INTO MY ABILITY TO BRING IT OUT AND TEACH HOPEFULLY SOON
SECRET HITLER ON KICKSTARTER IT'S AMAZING A NEXT GENERATION OF SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES

IT'S MAGNIFICENTLY SELF BALANCING IF THE GOOD GUYS DO REALLY WELL FOR THE FIRST FEW ROUNDS THEY'RE IN FOR A REALLY BAD TIME FOR THE NEXT FEW ROUNDS THE FASCIST LIBERAL CARD RATIO MECHANIC IS SHEER BRILLIANCE HAVING JUST JOINED THE GAME DESIGNER CLUB SUCCESSFUL KICKSTARTER WOO AND HAVING A DEGREE IN MATH I'M INSANELY JEALOUS
WONDERS I'VE ONLY PLAYED THE VARIANT SO FAR BUT IT'S A PERFECTLY BALANCED GAME MY PARTNER AND I HAVE EACH WON HALF A DOZEN GAMES OR SO LOOKING FORWARD TO EXPERIENCING IT WITH MORE PLAYERS
PICKED UP PATCHWORK IT'S AMAZING
I PICKED UP A FEAST FOR ODIN SO MY WIFE COULD GIVE IT TO ME FOR CHRISTMAS SHE DECIDED SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A SURPRISE GIFT INSTEAD SO I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT GAME IS EXCELLENT
THE PRODIGALS CLUB GOT IT YESTERDAY CAN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT HOW IT PLACES SINCE I DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO PLAY IT YET IT WILL HIT THE TABLE ON MONDAY I THINK I DO TRY TO BE AN EDUCATED CONSUMER SO I'M PRETTY SURE THE PURCHASE WAS A BULLSEYE JUST LIKE FOR EXAMPLE ALCHEMISTS OR DUNGEON PETZ BEFORE IT CGE IS SLOWLY BECOMING MY FAVORITE PUBLISHER
MY MOST RECENT PURCHASE WAS 2 COPIES OF TICKET TO RIDE FIRST JOURNEYS ONE FOR MY GOD DAUGHTER AND ONE FOR MY KIDS WOULD RECOMMEND IF YOU HAVE KIDS AROUND

LAST PURCHASE FOR ME WAS VIKINGS ON BOARD I THINK ALSO REALLY ENJOY IT TOTALLY OVERPRODUCED BUT THAT'S FINE IT'S A VERY FUN VERY MEAN GAME THAT I THINK I ONLY REALLY WANT TO PLAY AT THREE WAS OK BUT NOT AS GOOD AS FOUR WAS THERE IS A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF DICKER IN THIS GAME IVE ENJOYED IT SO FAR


GOT CLANK LAST WEEK AND DIDN'T GET TO PLAY IT UNTIL THIS LAST WEEKEND PLAYED IT TIMES IN A ROW AND CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT TO THE TABLE AGAIN IT'S AWESOME FUN MY OLD LADY HATES DECKBUILDERS BUT SHE WAS HAVING A GREAT TIME WITH THIS ONE IT'S A WINNER
GOT DEAD OF WINTER ABOUT A MONTH AGO AT BARNES AND NOBLE I FREAKING LOVE IT AND WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ELSE
GOT CAPTAIN SONAR A MONTH AGO IT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF PLAYS SINCE PURCHASE IT'S HARD TO PLAY JUST ONE SO FUN
WE BOUGHT GODS LAST WEEK AND WE ARE ENJOYING IT A LOT WE ALWAYS PLAY THE REAL TIME VERSION AND SWITCH FROM GAME TO GAME WITH OPEN OR HIDDEN GODS
I ACTUALLY JUST GOT MAGE KNIGHT A FEW DAYS AGO AS AN EARLY CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MYSELF SO FAR I'M LOVING IT I'VE ONLY PLAYED THE WALK-THROUGH INTRO SCENARIO AND I'M ABOUT ONE DAY INTO THE SOLO CONQUEST SCENARIO DEFINITELY MY HEAVIEST GAME BUT I WAS WATCHING LOTS OF VIDEOS PRIOR TO PURCHASE SO IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO CATCH ON ONCE I GOT IT I'VE ALREADY ADDED THE LOST LEGION EXPANSION TO MY WISH LIST
LAST WEEK WE PICKED UP A SMALL STACK AT A FLEA MARKET FANTASTIQA RUCKSACK EDITION PUERTO RICO AND FICHU WE HAVEN'T GOT TO PLAY PR YET AND FICHU WAS KIND OF MPH FANTASTIQA WAS AWFUL WAY TOO MUCH SETUP FOR A DEAD SIMPLE GAME MIGHT BE GOOD FOR FOLKS WITH KIDS TOM ASEL SEEMED TO LIKE IT BUT FOR TWO ADULTS WHO'VE PLAYED BETTER DECK BUILDERS IT WAS A SWING AND A MISS REAL SHAME BECAUSE THE COMPONENTS WERE NICE QUALITY AND IT HAD A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR

WE LIKE RACE FOR THE GALAXY AND SAN JUAN SO I'M HOPEFUL PUERTO RICO WILL FARE BETTER
PICKED UP THE MARKHAM HORROR CG ON THE RIGOROUS DECISION TREE OF LIKING MARKHAM HORROR AND THERE'S A CAT ON THE BACK OF THE BOX HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET BUT BEEN READING THROUGH THE RULES AND IT SEEMS PRETTY FUN BROLLY GONNA TRY IT THIS WEEKEND
FABLED FRUIT PLAYED 2 GAMES SO FAR AND AM VERY IMPRESSED SUCH A GREAT GAME WITH A VERY SIMPLE RULESET IT'S A REALLY GOOD TIME AND LOTS OF PLAYER INTERACTION
I RECENTLY BOUGHT LORD OF THE RINGS THE CARD GAME CORE SET FOR SOLO PLAY AND I'VE BEEN HAVING A BLAST IT'S THE BEST SOLO GAME I'VE PLAYED HAVEN'T PLAYED MAGE KNIGHT THAT BEING SAID THIS GAME IS NOT GOOD FOR MY WALLET BECAUSE OF THE DESIRE TO BUY ADDITIONAL SETS ADVENTURE PACKS
MOST RECENT PURCHASE WAS EXPANSIONS FOR GIFTS AND BEFORE THAT IS AN ONLINE PURCHASE THAT ISN'T HERE YET AND I PLAYED A WHILE BACK MYSTERY MOTIVE FOR MURDER LOVE THE ARTWORK AND I LIKE HOW IT PLAYS

THE MOST RECENT NEW GAMES PLAYED WERE BIOS GENESIS AND PAX RENAISSANCE BUT I PREORDER ED THAT A WHILE AGO

I'LL BE GETTING ARCHIPELAGO WITH THE SOLO EXPANSION TOMORROW SO THAT MIGHT GET PLAYED TOMORROW

PRIOR TO THAT WAS PANDEMIC REIGN OF CTHULHU WHICH WAS OKAY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FORBIDDEN DESERT AND PANDEMIC IN MY OPINION

OVERALL I'D SAY PAX RENAISSANCE IS ONE THAT I'D RECOMMEND THOSE LOOKING FOR A HEAVIER GAME IN A SMALL BOX AND THE ONE THAT INTERESTED ME THE MOST I REALLY ENJOY BIOS GENESIS BUT THAT'S A GAME I THINK HAS A MUCH NARROWER APPEAL
GREAT WESTERN TRAIL BRILLIANT GAME GREAT MIX OF MECHANICS WITH QUICK ELEGANT PLAY LOTS OF FACTORS TO WEIGH WITHOUT BEING OVERWHELMING HEAVY BUT APPROACHABLE CURRENTLY SITTING AS MY SECOND RATED GAME ON BG
AMONG THE STARS

HAVE HAD A FEW SOLO PLAYTHROUGHS HOLDS UP WELL
CRY HAVOC REALLY GOOD DUDES ON A MAP GAME WE ARE PLAYING IT MOSTLY ALWAYS PICKING SAME FACTION EMET IS GETTING WORRIED IN THE SHELF
I PICKED UP GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL AND SCYTHE FROM CSI WHICH GOT HERE EARLY THIS WEEK GOT MY FIRST PLAY OF GA IN AND I LOVE IT IT FELT VERY MUCH LIKE A FELD WITH TRYING TO GET ENOUGH SMALL BONUSES TO AVOID TAKING ONE OF THE FIVE ACTIONS ENDED SOMETHING LIKE I CAN SEE HOW THE GAME WOULD NOT BE GREAT WITH FOUR THOUGH NEXT SCYTHE
AN INFAMOUS TRAFFIC I LIKE IT A LOT SO FAR
OREGON TRAIL WAS ON SALE SO I GRABBED IT FOR AT TARGET I ALSO HAD TO JUMP ON THE FOR SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM STILL HAVE YET TO PLAY THE FIRST BUT I HAVE PLAYED THE OTHER AND I MAINLY BOUGHT IT TO EXPAND MY SEVEN YEAR OLD NEPHEW'S BOARD GAME HORIZON
I BOUGHT MYSTIC VALE CODENAMES CODENAMES PICTURES ARUBA AND THE BLOODY INN IN A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD ONLY PLAYED ARUBA AND THE BLOODY INN SO FAR REALLY LIKED BOTH OF THEM FOR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT REASONS OH AND I PREORDERED BLOOD BOWL BECAUSE I'M A SUCKER
ANIS IT ARRIVES SATURDAY SO EXCITED TO PLAY IT BEFORE THAT IT WAS SEAWALL WHICH MY GROUP HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY IT AGAIN
AFTER YEARS OF DEBATING I FINALLY BOUGHT TERRA MYSTIC I TEND TO BE TERRIBLE AT EURO GAMES THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED CAVERN I NEARLY HAD A MELTDOWN FROM KEEPING TRACK OF EVERYTHING SO I WAS SO AFRAID TM WAS GOING TO BE TOO COMPLICATED FOR ME

I BOUGHT IT AND PLAYED A 2 PLAYER PRACTICE GAME THAT SAME WEEKEND WITH MY FRIEND WHO OWNS CAVERN AND ENDED UP LOSING BUT I WAS INSTANTLY HOOKED I DREAMED ABOUT WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO NEXT TIME I PLAYED THAT RACE IT'S THE ONLY GAME I WANT TO PLAY LATELY

SURPRISINGLY ONE OF MY MOST PRONE FRIENDS HAS OPENED UP TO THE GAME WELL AND ENJOYS IT STARTING FROM HIS SECOND GAME HE STARTED MAKING SOME REALLY BOLD CHOICES THAT I'D NEVER SEEN HIM DO IN OTHER GAMES THAT WE ARE AFFECTIONATELY DUBBING SPRATS
I'VE BOUGHT A LOT OF GAMES THIS MONTH BUT THE ONLY ONE I'VE GOTTEN A CHANCE TO PLAY IS FURY OF DRACULA PLAYED ONE PRACTICE GAME WITH A FRIEND WE ENJOYED IT A LOT WE'VE PLAYED LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL FOR COMPARISON AND THE ONE ISSUE WITH THAT GAME IS THE DETECTIVES CAN START TO GET FRUSTRATED IF THEY HAVE A COLD TRAIL FOR A WHILE FURY AT LEAST GIVES THEM MORE OPTIONS FOR FINDING DRACULA
LETTERS FROM WHITE CHAPEL IT IS SO MUCH FUN AND EVEN MORE FUN WHEN YOU PLAY THE SOUNDTRACK FROM THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MOVIES
JUST GOT PARADE FOR A SIMPLE SET OF CARDS THERE IS A LOT GOING ON IT IS FRONT HEAVY IN THAT REGARD BUT AFTER A FEW ROUNDS IT SHOWS ITSELF TO BE A LIGHT GAME WITH A DEPTH OF STRATEGY PLAYS DIFFERENTLY AT DIFFERENT PLAYER COUNTS OVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR THE PRICE QUALITY OF COMPONENTS EVERYTHING WAS TOP OF THE LINE AND ITS GAMEPLAY
I PICKED UP STOCKPILE ABOUT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WHILE IT'S ONLY HIT THE TABLE OR SO TIMES THAT'S MORE BECAUSE OF LACK OF GAMING TIME THAN ANYTHING ELSE

THE GAME IS SIMPLE BUT ENGAGING AND I CAN TEACH IT IN IS A HUGE BONUS IN MY GROUP AS WE TEND TO HAVE QUITE A FEW PLAYERS WHO FLOAT IN AN OUT SO THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS SOMEONE NEW WE'VE PLAYED WITH BOTH VARIANTS INCLUDED IN THE BOX INVESTOR CARDS AND THE B SIDE OF THE BOARD AND WHILE WE LOVED THE BOARD THE INVESTORS PROBABLY WON'T GET USED MUCH THEY WERE SOLIDLY OK BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT AND EVERYONE WHO HAS PLAYED WITH THEM HAS KIND OF FELT THEY WEREN'T PARTICULARLY WELL BALANCED AND DIDN'T REALLY ADD THAT MUCH IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY TO BE FAIR THOUGH IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO JUDGE BALANCE BASED ON A FEW PLAYS SO THAT JUDGEMENT IS BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON GUT FEELING IMMOV

OVERALL IT'S A SOLID AUCTION BLUFFING GAME I CAN SEE IT COMING OUT QUITE OFTEN IN THE FUTURE AND I'M THINKING OF PICKING UP THE EXPANSION AT SOME POINT
KEYFLOWER IT'S JUST SO GOOD
GOOGLY EYES HONESTLY PRETTY FUN AND GOOFY DON'T SEE THE POINT OF THE BOARD BUT THOSE SPECS MAKE IT CRAZY HARD

REAL GAMES MARKHAM HORROR KING IN YELLOW EXPANSION CRAZY LOVED THIS EXPANSION AND MADE THE GAME SO FUN BLIGHTS ARE SUPER DIFFICULT AND THE PLAY IN TOWN TOTALLY MESSED UP EVERYONE
MY COPY OF CONAN ARRIVED A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO DOES THAT COUNT I DID TECHNICALLY PURCHASE IT TWO YEARS AGO

IT'S STUNNING REALLY I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH THE DETAIL AND SHEER QUANTITY OF MINIATURES I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET OF COURSE BUT AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT

IN TERMS OF ACTUAL PURCHASES I FINALLY GOT THE INDIA MAP FOR TICKET TO RIDE I REALLY REALLY LIKE IT THE MANDALA MECHANIC IS GREAT IT ADDS ANOTHER OPTION FOR THE LATE GAME RATHER THAN JUST GAMBLING WITH TICKETS NOT A HUGE FAN OF SWITZERLAND THOUGH I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE TUNNEL MECHANIC SOMETIMES REQUIRING EXTRA CARDS
CRIMSON CREEK KICKSTARTED GAME I PLAYED A FEW ROUNDS SOLO TO GET A FEEL FOR THE RULES AND PLAYED A 2 PLAYER GAME RECENTLY

PRO'S A VERY THEMATIC GAME SIMPLER GAME THAT THE RULEBOOK WOULD SUGGEST TENSION COMES FROM THE DEDUCTION OF KLEIN ATTACK AND POSSIBLE HIDDEN TRAITOR HOS BEEN POSSESSED

A FEW AREAS OF THE RULES ARE EASY TO FORGET YOU'LL NEED TO REFER TO RULEBOOK IN FIRST PLAYS I'M ALREADY CONSIDERING TO MAKE MY OWN REFERENCE CARDS AS REMINDERS DURING PLAY

THERE ARE BETTER GAMES BUT I REALLY LOVE THE THEME AND IMMERSION DURING PLAY KEEPER FOR NOW
ORLEANS TRADE AND INTRIGUE GOT THIS EXPANSION FOR ORLEANS AND PLAYED IT THE NEW BENEFICIAL DEEDS WORKED A LOT BETTER FOR A TWO PLAYER GAME THE DELIVERY CARDS MADE THE MOVING AROUND ON THE MAP MORE FUN AND MADE A VERY VIABLE STRATEGY TO FOCUS ON EVEN IF THE CARDS DO ADD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF RANDOMNESS THE FUN OF CHASING THE DELIVERIES TOTALLY OUTWEIGHED THE LUCK ELEMENT AT LEAST THAT'S HOW I FEEL SO FAR AFTER ONE PLAY NEW EVENT WAS A NICE FRESH THING THAT ADDED EVEN MORE NEW STUFF ALL IN ALL A VERY GOOD EXPANSION I WOULD SAY
MY DAUGHTER BOUGHT ME HANAFI FOR MY BIRTHDAY LAST WEEKEND WE'VE PLAYED IT ABOUT TIMES SO FAR IT'S REALLY GREAT MY KIDS ARE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT LOGIC AND DEDUCTION OUR BEST SCORE SO FAR IS OUR WORST IS AND THAT GAME WAS MY FAULT
I BOUGHT THE WHOLE BAND OF BROTHERS TRILOGY BUT STILL HAVEN'T HAD A CHACE TO TRY IT OUT YET STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE RULES MAKE TIME TO PLAY
FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE AND IT'S REALLY REALLY GOOD I ONLY PLAYED TWO GAMES WITH TWO PLAYERS WHERE THE ONE AHEAD BASHES THE ONE BEHIND BUT I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY IT WITH MORE PEOPLE
TINY EPIC WESTERN IT'S OK I WANT TO LOVE IT MORE THAN I DO

THE THEME IS BEAUTIFULLY REALISED IT LOOKS LOVELY ON THE TABLE THERE IS GREAT TENSION IN PUSHING YOUR LUCK BUT OF THE GAME COMES DOWN TO THE POKER HANDS WHICH TEND TO BE A FEAST OR FAMINE THE PLAYER POWERS AND BUILDING POWERS ARE UNDERWHELMING AND UNEXCITING AND YOU CAN SAFELY IGNORE THEM MUCH OF THE TIME
CONCORDIA AND WONDERS BOTH ARE EXCELLENT
I THINK THAT WOULD BE NAVEGADOR WHICH HAS GOTTEN A REPRINT RECENTLY

I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET BUT THE GAME LOOKS REALLY NEAT AND INTERESTING FOR A GAME LIKE CONCORDIA WHICH IS ALSO FROM THE SAME AUTHOR CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT TO THE TABLE
ESCAPE FROM COWLITZ ANNIVERSARY EDITION I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY IT WITH MY GAME GROUP YET BUT THE QUALITY OF COMPONENTS AND PACKAGING IS AMAZING PLUS THE ADDITION IF A HISTORY BOOKLET THAT TELLS YOU ABOUT THE ORIGINAL ATTEMPTS IS A REALLY COOL ADDITION
I PLAYED THIS GAME WHEN I WAS A KID AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IF IT'S AS FUN AS I REMEMBER
FORBIDDEN STARS

PLAYED A TEST GAME AS WITH MYSELF TO GET TO KNOW RULES BETTER AND ANOTHER WITH MY WIFE IN PREPARATION FOR FIRST ACTUAL GAME WIFE DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT SHE PREFERS OTHER TYPES OF GAMES HAD GOOD EXPECTATIONS OF THE GAME AND SO FAR I'M MORE THAN HAPPY WITH WHAT I'VE GOT WE'LL SEE HOW IT WILL GO VS OTHERS PLANNED FOR TONIGHT AND A PLAYER GAME TOMORROW BUT I HAVE MY HOPES UP
THE MANHATTAN PROJECT CHAIN REACTION JUST ARRIVED IN THE POST YESTERDAY I SAW IT ON DICE STOCKING FILLERS VIDEO I WAS GOING TO GET IT FOR ONE OF THE PEOPLE I GAME WITH REGULARLY BUT I FIGURED WE'D JUST PLAY THE GAMES AT MY HOUSE ANYWAY SO I BOUGHT IT FOR MYSELF INSTEAD REALLY ENJOYED MY FIRST PLAYTHROUGH WITH SO LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING IT WITH TONIGHT
I'VE NOT PLAYED THE GAMES FROM MY MOST RECENT PURCHASE BUT THE MOST RECENTLY PURCHASED ONE THAT I PLAYED IS MASTER OF ORION AND THE GAME IS VERY VERY GOOD
STRONGHOLD 2ND EDITION HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET BUT READ THE RULES AND SUPER KEEN
EVOLUTION CLIMATE WE HAVE PLAYED THE HECK OUT OF IT AND ARE HAPPY WE ORDERED IT THE GAME CAN BE FRIENDLY OR CUT THROATS AND THE TRAIT CARDS PROVIDE ENOUGH VARIABILITY THAT I EXPECT WE WILL PLAY IT ON A REGULAR BASIS
CHINATOWN

WE PLAYED ONE GAME AND IT WAS VERY NICE THE END SCORE WAS CLOSE AND THE TRADES WERE ELABORATE IT IS A GOOD GAME
MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME MY SON AND I HAVE PLAYED THE GAME A FEW TIMES AND ARE REALLY LIKING IT WE'VE MADE IT THROUGH THE FIRST 2 SCENARIOS AND WILL BE ATTEMPTING THE THIRD ONE TONIGHT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HOW THE GAME WOULD STAND UP TO REPEATED PLAYS BUT I FIND THAT THERE IS ENOUGH VARIABILITY IN THE GAME THROUGH DIFFICULTY RANDOMNESS AND CHARACTER SELECTION TO WARRANT MANY REPEATED PLAYS
GOT BRUGES AND TUSCANY ESSENTIAL EDITION LAST WEEK SO FAR I'VE ONLY PLAYED BRUGES BUT IT'S QUICKLY BECOMING ONE OF MY TOP GAMES
I PURCHASED PIXEL TACTICS 2 AND HAVE LOVED IT A LOT WITH MY PARTNER WE'VE PLAYED ALMOST EVERY LEADER AND SOME MULTIPLE TIME EACH I CAN'T WIN AGAINST ILANDRAYAMORELLA OR WHATEVER WE'RE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING THE NEXT SETS AND BUILDING DECKS WITH THEM
ABOUT MONTH AGO I BOUGHT FORBIDDEN STARS IN ORDER TO SELL IT PRIMALLY BUT I PLAYED IT WHILE AGO AND IT WAS AN EXCELLENT GAME I REALLY WANTED IN MY COLLECTION

IT SITS IN THE CORNER TEMPTING ME BUT I DO ENJOY SUCH FIGHT OVER MY CHARACTER SO FOR NOW I'M LEAVING IT IN SHRINK

ALSO A BUNCH OF EXPANSIONS FOR THESEUS THE DARK ORBIT TO BE PLAYED NEUROSHIMA HEX PLAYED I'M LOVING IT IT REMINDED ME THAT HEX ISN'T DEAD CHAOS IN THE OLD WORD TO BE PLAYED NEXT WEEK I'LL GET BLOOD RAGE MESICS IN MY HANDS AND I'M PLANNING ON PRINTING A FEW FAN ARMIES COMR NEUROSHIMA HEX
WONDERS DUEL

I AM IN LOVE WITH IT ONE OF THE NEATEST BLENDS OF MECHANICS I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE AND A GREAT BALANCE OF DEPTH AND BREVITY
JUST GOT COUP REFORMATION AND SPYFAULT HAVEN'T PLAYED THEM YET BUT IT'LL BE SORTED OUT SOON
FEAST FOR ODIN ONLY PLAYED IT ONCE BUT I LOVED IT
I SCOOPED UP A BEAUTIFUL BIG BOX OF ANIS EARLIER THIS WEEK AND GOT TO PLAY AN INTRODUCTORY FEW ROUNDS THOUGH NOT A FULL GAME IN SHORT I CAN'T FRIGGING WAIT TO PLAY AGAIN THE CARD DRAFTING PROVIDES A REALLY DIFFICULT METHOD TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU JUST WANT THOSE SWEET SWEET YELLOW CARDS EVERY ROUND

EVERY LITTLE BIT OF PROGRESS YOU MAKE ON THE BOARD FEELS LIKE A MONUMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT AND THE ASPECT OF ALBEIT SIMPLIFIED NEGOTIATION REALLY WORKS NICELY WHEN ALL PARTIES ARE GUARANTEED TO LOSE SOMETHING DURING THE CLASH

ALL IN ALL I HAVE NO BUYER'S REMORSE OVER THIS ONE WHATSOEVER AND IT ALREADY HAS A NICE BIG SPOT ON THE SHELF TO SHOW OFF ALL OF IT'S AMAZING ARTWORK
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF ARCTIC SCAVENGERS SINCE I PICKED IT UP LAST WEEK DOMINION WAS DRY FOR ME BUT I LIKE THE CONCEPT OF A DECK BUILDER YOUR OWN LITTLE ARMY STACK OF CARDS THAT YOUR CONSTANTLY IMPROVING AND WEEDING OUT THE BAD CARDS ARCTIC SCAVENGERS HITS ITS THEME PERFECTLY I LOVE THE SKIRMISHES FOR CONTESTED RESOURCES THE RANDOMNESS OF SEARCHING THROUGH THE JUNK PILE AND THE CARDS IN THE BANK ARE FAIR AND BALANCED I ALSO PICKED UP FRIDAY A FEW WEEKS AGO SO I'VE BEEN IN DECK BUILDER HEAVEN FOR A LITTLE WHILE
HAVEN'T WATCHED THE VIDEO PLAYED THIS THREE TIMES AT BGGCON AND IMMEDIATELY PREORDERED IT THROUGH MINIATURE MARKET THIS IS LOW PLAYER COUNT APPROVED
THIS IS SO MUCH ON MY LIST ALONG WITH FABLED FRUIT
HE SAYS IT KILLED ORA ET LABARA FOR HIM I JUST ORDERED OEP A COUPLE DAYS AGO I DON'T REGRET IT THOUGH COLONISTS DOES LOOK INTERESTING BUT I'M NOT SURE MY GROUP WILL PLAY A GAME OF THIS LENGTH
THIS IS A GAME I WANT BUT THE GAME LENGTH SCARES ME
I NEED TO GET THIS GAME TO THE TABLE
PITY IT'S UNAVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
I'VE HAD THIS PREORDERED FOR A WHILE AND IT'S BEEN ON MY WATCHLIST SINCE IT WAS ANNOUNCED WHILE I TRUST LOOKOUT AND THE THEME SOUNDED INTERESTING IT WAS HARD TO TELL WHAT IT MIGHT BE SINCE THIS IS DESIGNER TIM PULS FIRST ENDEAVOUR I'M SUPER HAPPY TO HEAR THAT PEOPLE ARE LIKING IT FROM PLAYS OF THE ADVANCED ESSEN COPIES I LOVE THE IDEA OF SAVING A GAME AND CONTINUING LATER THIS CATERS TO MY LIFE AS A GAMER DAD


I'LL HAVE TO CHECK THIS ONE OUT
SHAME RADIO WON'T BE DOING A VIDEO FOR FEUDUM
I GOT TO PLAY THIS AT AND I'D SAY TIME ESTIMATES ARE A LITTLE HYPERBOLIC I PLAYED A FOUR PLAYER TWO AGE GAME WHERE ALL FOUR OF US HAD NEVER PLAYED BEFORE AND IT TOOK UNDER TWO HOURS THE NEXT DAY I PLAYED A FULL FOUR AGE FOUR PLAYER GAME WITH TWO NEW PLAYERS AND IT TOOK JUST BARELY OVER FOUR HOURS I THINK SAVING AND CONTINUING AFTER EACH AGE MIGHT ADD A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE GAME AS THE PLAYERS WILL HAVE TO REACQUAINT THEMSELVES WITH THE BOARD STATE AND THEIR STRATEGY EACH TIME BUT EVEN THEN SEVEN HOURS SEEMS LIKE A STRETCH
R BOARDGAMEDEALS
LOOKS LIKE A GREAT WEEKEND

TO ASSUAGE YOUR CONCERNS A BIT WITH TWILIGHT IMPERIUM THE GAME REALLY COMES TO LIFE IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH EXPERIENCED PLAYERS AND AGGRESSIVE INTERACTIVE PUBLIC GOALS I THINK IT SIMPLY HAS TOO HIGH A MENTAL LOAD TO ALLOW NEW PLAYERS TO GET TOTALLY STUCK IN TO THE REAL GAME OF PLANNING MANOEUVRING NEGOTIATION POLITICKING AND BACKSTABBING IT'S A SHAME THAT GETS LOST IN THE FIRST PLAY WITH SIMPLY TRYING TO KEEP SOME OF THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR HEAD AT ANY TIME RESOURCE COSTS WHAT EACH SHIP TYPE ACTUALLY IS LOOKS LIKE WHAT THE NEXT TECH TREE PURCHASE COULD BE HOW MANY SPACES EACH SHIP CAN MOVE WHAT THE STRATEGY CARDS ACTUALLY DO HOW THE TRANSFER ACTION WORKS ETC IT'S JUST TOO MUCH TO KEEP ALL THAT AND FUNCTIONALLY MAKE PLANS THAT CAN BE FLUID FUNCTIONAL AND HIGHLY REACTIVE ENGAGING WITH OTHER PLAYERS

HOWEVER ONCE PEOPLE HAVE GOT THAT STUFF MEMORIED EFFECTIVELY IT GENUINELY DOES TRANSFORM INTO THIS EPIC GRAND GAME WHERE THE FOCUS IS ON OUTPLAYING YOUR FRIENDS RATHER THAN MANAGING A SPRAWLING SPREADSHEET

THAT SAID MANOEUVRING AROUND THE BOARD IS INCREDIBLY SLOW AND COMBAT IS SO COSTLY THAT IT DOES ENCOURAGE PLAYERS TO BUNCH UP THEIR UNITS AND KEEP THEM LARGELY STATIONARY WHAT WE'VE FOUND THAT REALLY ENCOURAGES SMALLER MORE ACTIVE FORCES IS A SELECTION OF THE OBJECTIVE CARDS THAT FORCE ENGAGEMENT EAST G SUCCESSFULLY WIN A GROUND ENGAGEMENT KILL A SINGLE ENEMY SHIP COMBINED WITH INTERESTING WORMHOLE PLACEMENT AND ARTIFACTS ARTIFACT PLANETS ESPECIALLY GO A LONG WAY TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEMS OF FORCE BUILDUP IN PURELY HOMESYSTEMS AROUND MERCAPTOL REX IF YOU LIKELY FOUND THAT PEOPLE KEPT TO THEIR AND DIDN'T INTERACT WITH OTHERS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE THEN THE SHATTERED ASCENSION MAPS MAY BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEY'RE RADICAL THAT PUT PLAYERS INTO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THAN ARRANGED NEATLY AROUND THE EDGE OF THE TABLE AND THEY REALLY ENCOURAGE INTERESTING FLEET MOVEMENT AND CONSTANT DIPLOMACY A CAVEAT THE SETUPS AREN'T EQUAL AND INVOLVE BIDDING FOR PLACEMENT SO REQUIRE PLAYERS WHO CAN ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF THE LOCATIONS

THAT'S A LOT MORE THAN I MEANT TO WRITE LOOKS LIKE A GREAT TIME
HEY MANUAL I WAS JUST WONDERING ABOUT THOSE GREEN BOARDS MATS YOU USED IN SOME OF YOUR PHOTOS WHAT MATERIAL IS IT AND WHERE CAN I GET SOMETHING SIMILAR I'VE GIVEN UP ON OWNING AN ACTUAL GAMING TABLE AND THIS SEEMS LIKE THE NEXT BEST THING THANKS
THIS SOUNDS LIKE AN ENVIABLE WEEKEND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE REPORT
YOU SAY CRACKED A LOT
WOW REALLY LOOKS LIKE AN AMAZING WEEKEND
WISH A HAD GROUP OF FRIENDS TO PLAY GAMES WITH REGULARLY
LOOKS AMAZING

I HAVE THAT SAME DUVET SET LOL
MPH I WISH I HAD MORE FRIENDS
YOUR OPINION OF SCYTHE PLEASE BEFORE I FINALLY GO AND BUY IT
SOUNDS LIKE AN AMAZING TIME THANKS FOR THE WRITE UP I MAY STEAL YOUR TWILIGHT IMPERIUM INTRO FOR WHEN I EVENTUALLY GET THE GAME YOU'VE ACTUALLY INSPIRED ME TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH MY FRIENDS
IN ALL OF THESE AMAZING PICTURES I KEYED ON ONE STUPID THING I NOTICED THAT THE BLUE PLAYER IN YOUR SCYTHE GAME HAS BOTH A MONUMENT AND A MILL BUILT ON THE SAME TERRITORY WHICH IS ILLEGAL ONLY STRUCTURE PER TERRITORY

NOT SURE IF YOU KNEW THAT OR NOT OR WAS THERE A CARD PLAY THAT ALLOWED YOU TO DO THAT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH AN ACTION OR A CARD THAT LETS YOU BREAK THAT RULE BUT I MIGHT BE WRONG

ANYWAY SORRY FOR BEING PEDANTIC YOUR GAMING WEEKEND LOOKS FLIPPIN AWESOME AND NOW I'M INSPIRED TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR THANKS FOR SHARING
VERY COOL GLAD YOU LIKED SCYTHE I LOVE IT TOO FEEL FREE TO ASK ANY RULES QUESTIONS
I'D SUGGESTS LEGENDS OF ANDOR BECAUSE IT TAKES THE TROPE OF HEROES BASHING ALL THE MONSTERS TO WIN AND TOSSES IT OUT THE WINDOW YES YOU CAN DO THAT BUT IN THIS GAME EVERY DEFEATED MONSTER ADVANCES THE STORY COUNTER UP THE TRACK GO ON A SLAUGHTERFEST AND THE GAME RACES TO THE END AND YOU LOSE INSTEAD YOU HAVE TO STRATEGICALLY PICK AND CHOOSE YOUR BATTLES AND WHAT TO DEFEAT
REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

ENJOY THE ALIEN OR PREDATOR MOVIES TRY ONE OF THE LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS GAMES

STARSHIP TROOPERS TRY XENOSHYFT

WANNA PLOT TO ASSASSINATE HITLER LOOK AT THE NEW RELEASE BLACK ORCHESTRA

ENJOY HOVERCRAFT A LOT AND WANT MORE ELDER SIGN IS HERE FOR YOUR NEEDS

WANT TO PLAY A DUNGEON CRAWLER AS A RODENT MICE MYSTICS MIGHT BE YOUR IN AUTHOR NAMES JAMIESON

INTERESTED IN CHRISTIANITY MAYBE COMMISSIONED IS UP YOUR ALLEY

WANT TO FREE THE SLAVES FREEDOM THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD

FANCY A GOOD MYSTERY TO SOLVE SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE IS THERE FOR YOU

I HAVE NOT PLAYED A FEW OF THESE I'M JUST OFFERING SUGGESTIONS
MACHS VS MINIONS IS AN AWESOME CO-OP GAME IT IS ON THE MORE EXPENSIVE SIDE BUT IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL AND WELL PUT TOGETHER GAME THAT IT IS WORTH IT

IT PLAYS AND WITH CUSTOM MISSIONS THAT HAVE INFINITE REPLAY VALUE THE GAME FEELS LIKE IT WON'T STOP GIVING IVE PERSONALLY BURNED THROUGH THE TUTORIAL COUNTLESS TIMES TO INTRODUCE NEW PLAYERS TO THE GAME AND HAVE YET TO TIRE OF IT

GAMEPLAY MECHANIC WISE IT IS A DRAFTING COMPUTING GAME THAT YOU NEED TO COMPLETE VARIOUS OBJECTIVES TO COMPLETE THE MISSIONS

GOOD LUCK
FLASHPOINT FIRE RESCUE
THEME COMES THROUGH REALLY WELL
BURGLE BROS IS A FANTASTIC HEIST THEMED GAME IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST CO OP GAMES THAT I HAVE PLAYED


THINK OF IT AS FORBIDDEN OFFICE COMPLEX
I WOULD SUGGEST ROBINSON CRUSOE A LOT OF REPLACEABILITY AND OVERALL VERY FUN AND JUST GOT A NEW RELEASE I'M NOT A SUPER PANDEMIC FAN BUT THE IN THE LAB EXPANSION IS BY FAR THE MOST FUN SETUP I'VE PLAYED PANDEMIC IN MIGHT BUT FUN TO TAKE A LOOK AT
JUST TO ADD A FEW DIFFERENT ONES I JUST PICKED UP HANAFI AND SAMURAI SPIRIT
BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL IS AN INTERESTING COOP GAME WHERE ONE PERSON TURNS EVIL
CASTLE PANIC IS GREAT FOR WHAT YOU WANT
AND THEN WE HELD HANDS IS MY FIANCE AND I'S FAVORITE CO-OP GAME WITH THE RIGHT THEME FOR COUPLES TO BOOT
IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE THE HOVERCRAFT THEME MARKHAM HORROR CARD GAME IS FABULOUS

A FUN CO-OP GAME IS FLASH POINT FIRE RESCUE
I STARTED WITH PANDEMIC WHEN I STARTED DATING MY GIRLFRIEND YEARS BACK AND NOW WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD COLLECTION OF COOP GAMES THIS IS THE LIST WITHOUT ANY PRIORITY

ZOMBICIDE ANY OF THEM WOULD DO EITHER START WITH SEASON AND GO SLOWLY INTO SEASON AND EXPANSIONS OR START WITH ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE AS IT HAS BETTER RULES AS THEY HAVE BEEN REVIEWED MANY TIMES

BURGLE BROS THIS ONE WAS A BIG SURPRISE AND VERY FUN TO PLAY CHALLENGING AS WELL

SUPER DUNGEON EXPLORE FORGOTTEN KING THIS IS GAME IS BASICALLY THE VIDEOGAME GAUNTLET BUT IN A BOARDGAME PRETTY FUN TO PLAY EITHER ONE AGAINST THE TEAM OR JUST AGAINST THE GAME

FORBIDDEN DESERT THIS ONE IS A DIFFERENT TAKE ON THE FORBIDDEN ISLAND SO THIS ONE SHOULDN'T BE PRIORITY

FLASHPOINT I'VE HEARD WONDERS ABOUT THIS ONE AS IT IS BASICALLY PANDEMIC BUT WITH FIREFIGHTERS I DO NOT OWN THIS ONE SO I CANNOT TELL YOU MUCH MORE

THIS ARE THE ONES I CAN COME UP ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD MY COLLECTION IS QUITE VARIED
I SUGGEST SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE KIND OF LIKE TIME STORIES BUT WITH CASES IN THE BOX MY GROUP LOVED IT
ROBINSON CRUSOE IS QUITE A FUN CO-OP GAME JUST PREPARE TO STARVE TO DEATH A LOT SINCE IT'S QUITE A DIFFICULT GAME
AND IF YOU TWO ARE READY FOR SOMETHING QUITE A BIT MORE HEAVIER AND STRATEGY INTENSIVE THERE'S ALWAYS MAGE KNIGHT THOUGH IT MAY BE TOO HEAVY FOR YOU TWO AS GAMES CAN LAST UPWARDS OF HOURS AND THERE'S A LOT OF THINKING INVOLVED
DESCENT 2 ED WITH THE APP CAN NOW BE PLAYED CO-OP IF YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR SOME DUNGEON CRAWLING
AND THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THE INFAMOUS PANDEMIC LEGACY WHICH YOU PROBABLY KNOW OF AND IS BELOVED BY ALL OF REDDIN IT SEEMS THOUGH I PERSONABLY HAVEN'T PLAYED IT
SURPRISED NO ONE HAS MENTIONED PANDEMIC LEGACY YET THE TOP RANKED GAME ON AND SO ADDICTIVE MY WIFE AND I PLAYED IT THROUGH IN TWO WEEKENDS TOTAL PLAYING TIME WAS PROBABLY ABOUT HOURS OR SO THE ONLY DOWNSIDE FOR YOU MIGHT BE THAT VANILLA PANDEMIC WILL NEVER FEEL THE SAME AGAIN

OH AND IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING WHETHER IT'S EVEN WORTH PLAYING IF YOU'VE PLAYED PANDEMIC A BUNCH IT TOTALLY IS THE LEGACY COMPONENT ADDS SO MANY DIFFERENT NUANCES THAT VERY QUICKLY YOU FORGET HOW SIMPLE THE BASE GAME WAS

ALSO MY WIFE AND I WERE FACING A SIMILAR DECISION RECENTLY AND ENDED UP BUYING STAR TREK FRONTIERS WHICH IS A SOMEWHAT MODIFIED SLIGHTLY SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF MAGE KNIGHT WITH A SCENARIO WE LIKED BETTER HAVE ONLY PLAYED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES SO FAR DEFINITELY HAS WAY HIGHER COMPLEXITY THAN ANY OF OUR PREVIOUS CO-OP GAMES WE MISSED A BUNCH OF RULES IN BOTH GAMES BUT IT DOES SHOW A LOT OF POTENTIAL
MY PARTNER AND I TEND TO ENJOY LIGHTER GAMES SO I'D RECOMMEND KNIERIM AND AND THEN WE HELD HANDS TRY BEYOND BAKER STREET TOO

THIS ISN'T A COOPERATIVE GAME BUT RECENTLY WE HAVE BEEN LOVING HIVE AND IF YOU DON'T MIND SOME MIND GAMES DAYS IS A VERY THEMATIC GAME A DECK BUILDING FAVOURITE FOR US TWO IS DALE OF MERCHANTS
MY WIFE AND I
WE HAVE MANY COLLECTORS IN THE GROUPS I PLAY IN MY MODEST COLLECTION OF GAMES IS FAR FROM THE LARGEST SO THERE ARE ALWAYS ALWAYS NEW GAMES TO PLAY WE STILL SOMEHOW MANAGE TO GET SOME REPEAT PLAYS IN BUT I'D SAY ALMOST EVERY SESSION INVOLVES AT LEAST ONE NEW GAME HITTING THE TABLE
I WILL ALWAYS LEARN A NEW GAME IF POSSIBLE I'D NEVER GO BACK IF IT MEANT I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING NEW TO PLAY

MY BOYFRIEND ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD GLADLY PLAY ONE GAME TIMES AND MASTER IT WHICH I THINK IS THE MOST BORING THING I'VE EVER HEARD
WHAT'S A GAME GROUP PRECIOUS

HONESTLY I PREFER OLD CLASSICS MY GROUP PREFERS LEARNING NEW GAMES TO AN EXTENT GOOD NEWS IS THERE ARE PLENTY OF OLD GAMES I CAN BRING IN AND MASQUERADE AS NEW ONES
I LOVE REPLAYING AS DO MOST IN MY MAIN GROUP BUT I ALSO PLAY WITH THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO GO TO ESSEN EVERY YEAR AND CROWDFUND
THERE ARE ALWAYS NEW GAMES TO TRY AND MY GROUP GENERALLY IS EXCITED TO LEARN THEM BUT WE SO ALSO ALWAYS GO BACK TO STUFF WE'VE PLAYED BEFORE SINCE A FEW PEOPLE TEND TO PREFER PLAYING WHAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH AND CAN SOMETIMES BE RESISTANT TO TRYING NEW THINGS

ME I CAN GENERALLY PLAY A BRAND NEW GAMES A FEW TIMES AND THEN I'LL BE GOOD ON PLAYING IT FOR MONTHS FROM THERE ON OUT I TEND TO BE CONTENT IF I ONLY PLAYED ANY GIVEN GAME AT LEAST ONCE IN A YEAR
THE DYNAMIC IN MY GROUP IS MUCH THE SAME FOR A LONG TIME I WAS ALWAYS INTRODUCING NEW GAMES AND PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COMPLAINING THAT THEY NEVER GET TO PLAY THE SAME GAME TWICE SO FINALLY I'VE BEEN JUST GAMES FOR THE LAST MONTHS OR SO BARELY PLAYING ANY NEW GAMES WITH THEM

THERE IS ONE PERSON IN THE GROUP WHO IS PARTICULARLY STUBBORN ABOUT ONLY PLAYING THE SAME GAMES THAT THAT PERSON KNOWS

FOR A WHILE MY GROUP WAS BIG ENOUGH TO SPLIT INTO TWO SO I COULD TEACH SOME PEOPLE A NEW GAME WHILE THE OTHER PEOPLE PLAYED A FAMILIAR GAME UNFORTUNATELY NUMBERS HAVE FALLEN IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS
THE COSMODEX AN ENCYCLOPEDIA FOR COSMIC ENCOUNTER

TRY THAT I'VE FOUND IT PRETTY USEFUL

DURING ACTUAL GAMES THOUGH WE USUALLY WON'T BOTHER LOOKING THINGS UP JUST GO WITH WHATEVER SEEMS THE MOST REASONABLE AND THEN I'LL CHECK IT AFTER
GENERALLY OF THE TIME IF YOU GO BACK AND WALK THROUGH WHICH PHASE THINGS OCCUR IN YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS FIRST
MOST THINGS CAN BE WORKED OUT BY A COUPLE OF RULES OF THUMB PHASES FIRST OBVIOUSLY PLANNING ALIENS BEFORE THE REVEAL ETC

THEN AS WITH CHOOSING ALLIANCES OFFENSE DEFENSE CLOCKWISE FROM OFFENSE

SO IF TWO ALIENS ARE MODIFYING THE SCORE IN THE REVEAL MODIFIER HAPPENS FIRST
IF YOU HAVE SOME TROUBLE COMING TO A DECISION THEN I SUGGEST YOU DECIDE WITH YOUR GROUP BEFOREHAND ON HOW CONFLICTS WILL BE HANDLED SUCH AS A COIN TOSS ROCK PAPER SCISSORS OR A GROUP VOTE THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF EVERYONE CAN'T REACH CONSENSUS

ALSO IF IT'S A TIMING CONFLICT IT'S RESOLVED IN THE ORDER OF OFFENSE DEFENSE ALLIES BLAH BLAH
I OWN THE RETAIL BOX OF THE FIRST CORE GAME BEYOND THE GRAVE AND A SMALL HANDFUL OF EXTRA HEROES I FIND THAT IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH GAME I UNDERSTAND YOUR HESITATION YOU LOOK BACK AT THE KICKSTARTER AND FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MISSING STUFF HAVING HEROES TO CHOOSE FROM IS NICE I SUPPOSE AND SOME PEOPLE REALLY PUMP UP THE VARIETY THAT ALL THOSE EXTRAS OFFER BUT TRULY YOU'RE NOT MISSING OUT ON ANYTHING REALLY DON'T LET THAT COMPLEXIONIST BUG BITE YA THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME STYLE KICKSTARTER GAMES OUT THERE BUT I FIND THAT AS MORE TIME GOES ON AQ IS ONE THAT STANDS FINE ON IT'S RETAIL LEGS I WENT ALL IN ON BLACK PLAGUE THINKING HA I'LL GET IN ON IT THIS TIME I BASICALLY HAVE DUDES WITH SWORDS THAT GIVE MY GROUP SENSORY OVERLOAD WHEN TRYING TO PICK SURVIVORS JUST MY 2 CENTS
I ACTUALLY BOUGHT ARCADIA QUEST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO FROM AMAZON

THE RETAIL VERSION COMES WITH TWELVE HEROES AND ONE CAMPAIGN IN THE BOX THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH HERE TO WARRANT PURCHASING THE HEROES IN THE BOX ARE VARIED AND ALL PLAY DIFFERENTLY NO TWO MISSIONS OR CAMPAIGNS EVER UNFOLD EXACTLY THE SAME

IF YOU'RE AT ALL INTERESTED GO AHEAD AND BUY IT THERE ARE PLENTY OF GOODIES IN THE BOX WITHOUT THE KS STUFF THERE'S ALSO EXPANSIONS AND HEROES FOR PURCHASE AS WELL I HAVEN'T REGRETTED MY PURCHASE AT ALL

I OWN THE BASE AND BEYOND THE GRAVE NO KICKSTARTER AND IT'S A SMASH HIT WITH A FEW FRIENDS I'VE LATE PLEDGED INFERNO BUT I DON'T FEEL AT ALL THAT I'M MISSING ANYTHING BY NOT HAVING THE PREVIOUS KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVES ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES FOR SURE
YOU CAN GO TO THEIR WEBSITE AND PRINT THE CARDS FOR THE KS EXCLUSIVE HEROES
CIRC THAT STUFF IS MAINLY KS EXCLUSIVE HEROES WITH VERY LITTLE EFFECT ON GAMEPLAY IT'S REPORTEDLY A GOOD GAME EVEN IF YOU BUY AT RETAIL
I'M PLAYING RIGHT NOW WITH MY SON HOLIDAY TIME OF IS GREAT FOR CAMPAIGN BOARD GAMES THIS IS OUR THIRD TIME THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN WE HAVE JUST THE RETAIL BASE GAME AND IT'S FANTASTIC WE'VE ALSO ORDERED INFERNO BUT IF THE ARCADIA QUEST BASE GAME WAS ALL WE HAD IT WOULD STILL BE TONS OF FUN
ARCADIA QUEST IS MY FAVORITE GAME AND THAT WAS BEFORE I GOT THE KICKSTARTER STUFF HONESTLY I HAVEN'T REALLY EVEN BEEN ABLE TO MOVE BEYOND THE CORE SET TO TRY OUT THE NAMELESS OR BEYOND THE GRAVE CAMPAIGNS

BY THE WAY THE NAMELESS CAMPAIGN IS NOT A NEW CAMPAIGN IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME CAMPAIGN BUT YOU SWITCH OUT SOME MONSTERS AND BOSSES WITH VOLDEMORT DEATH EATER TYPE ENEMIES BEYOND THE GRAVE IS A WHOLE NEW CAMPAIGN WITH NEW QUESTS ITEMS AND MONSTERS BOSSES
I HAVE THE BASE GAME I PLEDGED FOR THE LAST KICKSTARTER BUT WAS TOO LATE FOR THE FIRST

I'D BE LYING IF I SAID I WASN'T DROOLING OVER THE EXCLUSIVES BUT REALLY THERE'S NOTHING SUBSTANTIAL MISSING IT'S A VERY CORRECT THEM ALL POKÉMON FEEL BUT YOU STILL GET OF AN AMAZING GAME WITHOUT THEM

THE EXCLUSIVES ARE ABOUT HEROES ENEMIES THIS JUST OFFER GREATER VARIETY BUT NOT IN VERY IMPORTANT WAYS

I REALLY LIKE ARCADIA QUEST A LOT AND I FEEL FOR YOU I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE FIRST BUT STILL GET IT IF YOU WANT THE VARIETY OF ABILITIES FOR THE YOU PLAY WITH PRINT THE EXCLUSIVES

LOOK WHAT I DID JUST THIS LAST WEEK GUILDMASTER HEROS HETP
AND THIS IMAGER ALBUM

I KNOW THE STANDEES ARE NOT THE SAME AS HAVING THE ACTUAL MINIATURES BUT BETTER THAT THAN NOTHING OR PAYING HUNDREDS FOR PLASTIC

AND IF YOU PRINT THE HERO CARDS AND GET EXPANSIONS FOR MORE MONSTERS MONSTERS IN THE BASE GAME CAN BE USED AS HEROS

ARCADIA QUEST IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES AND THEY WILL RELEASE ANOTHER KICKSTARTER WITHIN 2 YEARS AND YOU'LL GET A TON OF EXTRA HEROS THERE

IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IF THE HEROS IN THE CAMPAIGNS WEREN'T EXCLUSIVE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN THAT MANY MADE BEING EXCLUSIVE GIVES A LARGE INCENTIVE TO BACK THE CAMPAIGN LEADING TO MUCH LARGER FINAL FUNDING AMOUNTS AND THUS THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE LOTS OF EXTRA FIGURES

BASICALLY THE EXCLUSIVES VS NON EXCLUSIVES ARE A VERY SMALL DIFFERENCE IN ACTUAL GAMEPLAY UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT TO COLLECT EVERY FIGURE WHICH AT THIS POINT IS VERY COSTLY THERE'S NO REASON TO NOT JUST PRINT THE RULES FOR THE EXCLUSIVES AND SUBSTITUTE WITH STANDEES OR OTHER FIGURES

KIND OF LIKE POKÉMON BLACK BEING AVAILABLE NORMALLY BUT POKÉMON WHITE BEING SPECIAL AND EXCLUSIVE WHEN THE DIFFERENCE IS MAINLY IN OUR HEADS

I ALSO HAVE BLOOD RAGE RETAIL I REALLY WANT THE KICKSTARTER MONSTERS BUT I FUCKING LOVE THE BASE GAME PLAYED OVER TIMES DOESN'T MATTER IT'S ALL JUST INCENTIVES TO HELP FUND THE GAME BUT THERE ARE OVER RETAIL AVAILABLE HEROES NOW OR WILL BE ONCE INFERNO AND MAZMORRA AND EXPANSIONS BECOME AVAILABLE

WOULD YOU BUY THE EXCLUSIVES IF THEY DIDN'T MAKE THEM EXCLUSIVE AND THEY WERE AVAILABLE RETAIL THAT WOULD BE OVER SUDDENLY YOU WOULDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT MOST OF THEM SEE MY POINT IT'S ALL PERSPECTIVE
YOU CAN PROBABLY GET THE BASE GAME FOR LESS THAN THIS IN THE RIGHT SALE OR SECONDHAND IF IT'S NOT WORTH QUITE SO MUCH TO YOU
I STARTED WITH ONLY THE CORE SET AND IT IS CURRENTLY MY FAVORITE GAME
THERE'S SO MUCH CONTENT NOW AT RETAIL YOU'RE REALLY NOT MISSING OUT THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS YOU CAN GET AT RETAIL AMONGST ALL OF THE BOXES SO THERE'S ANOTHER THAT ARE EXCLUSIVE YOU REALLY DON'T NEED THAT MANY
I WOULD WAIT FOR THE ARCADIA QUEST INFERNO TO BE RELEASED AND GET THAT
I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO LATE AT ALL THE BASE CONTENT IS A LOT THE KS STUFF IS MOSTLY JUST FOR EXTRA VARIETY MORE HERO CHOICE ETC BUT THEN YOU CAN BUY LOTS OF EXTRA HEROES TOO
I DON'T KNOW IF THE INFERNO LATE PLEDGE WAS MORE THAN BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THIS LET'S SAY IT WAS AT LEAST AND TO SHIP I GOT AQ BASE FOR ABOUT ON AMAZON WAREHOUSE BTU IS NORMALLY ASSUMING INFERNO WILL EVENTUALLY REACH THE SAME RANGE AS THE AQ BASE BOX I'LL END UP PLAYING OR SO WITH FREE PRIME SHIPPING SO IT WILL COST ME A WHOLE MORE IF THAT FOR FAR FAR MORE TILE SETS AND CAMPAIGN CONTENT AND STILL HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH CHARACTERS WITHOUT THE STRETCHGOALS

I JUST DON'T SEE THE CAMPAIGN AS WORTH IT IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE AQ START WITH THE BASE AND IF YOU PLAY ENOUGH GET BTU YOU WILL HAVE MORE GAME READY TO PLAY SOONER THAN THE INFERNO SET WILL COME IN TO ANY BACKERS

ITS DEFINITELY A PRETTY GOOD GAME EVEN WITHOUT THE EXTRA OPTIONS I KICKSTARTED THEM AND HAVE THE EXTRAS BUT IT LEADS TO ALOT OF EXTRA SET UP TIME IN A GAME WHERE THE SET UP TIME IS ALREADY MY BIGGEST PROBLEM THE EXTRA TIME WHEN IT COMES TO DEAL OUT ALL THE CHARACTER CARDS AND THEN DIG THROUGH EXTRA CHARACTERS FOR THE ONES PEOPLE PICK IN ADDITION TO SOME OF LEVEL OF BALANCE OF THE BONUS CHARACTERS BEING OFF IMO AND YOU WONT BE HURTING FOR VARIETY WITH THE CHARACTERS IN THE BASE BOX
I HAVE PLAYED THE BASE GAME WITH SOME FRIENDS BACK IN SPAIN AND IT WAS PRETTY FUN I DO KNOW ABOUT THE KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVES AS I HAVE BACKED SOME OF THEIR PROJECTS BEFORE BUT EVEN THE BASE GAME IS GOOD ENOUGH TO NOT MISS ANY OF THE EXTRA STUFF UNTIL YOU PLAY IT ENOUGH SO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO EXPAND THE GAME
YOU GET PLENTY OF GAME IN THE RETAIL BOX
PANAMA WITH PLAYERS IS THREE TIMES BETTER THAN WITH PLAYERS WHICH IS TEN TIMES BETTER THAN WITH 2 PLAYERS IT REALLY WANTS PLAYERS TO BE AT ITS BEST


CHICAGO EXPRESS IS QUITE QUICK LIKE WELL UNDER MINUTES OTHERWISE IF YOU'RE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH FOR SOMETHING REALLY CHALLENGING AND MUCH LONGER GET A COPY OF GMT S

OR SOMETHING MUCH EASIER TO LEARN THAN BRASS BUT JUST AS CHALLENGING AND LONG TO PLAY WELL AGAINST COMPETENT OPPONENTS AGE OF STEAM RULES ARE VERY SIMPLE BUT THE INTERACTION AND COMPETITION ARE SO FUN THAT SOME GAME DESIGNERS STILL FIND IT AMUSING TO CREATE NEW MAPS THERE ARE WELL OVER EXPANSION MAPS
THE FOLLOWING ARE ALL VILLAIN AND ALLY PACKS OF WAVE CORE SET

GENERAL WEISS THERE IS ALREADY AN IN THE CORE SET SO GETTING WEISS IS REALLY A LUXURY IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE COMMAND CARDS

ROYAL GUARD CHAMPION

IG

HAN SOLO

CHEWBACCA

REBEL TROOPERS

REBEL SABOTEURS

TAKEN A LOOK AT PATCHISTORY
IT'S REALLY JUST THEMED A VENEER OF IT PELOPONNESE WHICH TAKES ABOUT AN HOUR MAYBE MINUTES WITH SOME EXPANSIONS THROWN IN IT'S A ANCIENT BUT MOSTLY IT'S A TOUGH AUCTION GAME MEDIUM WEIGHT AND PLAYS

IF YOUR FRIENDS LIKE IT I'D SUGGEST BUYING PELOPONNESE BOX WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE EXPANSIONS TOTAL AND ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY UP TO LAYER THIS PACK DOES NOT INCLUDE THE BASE GAME SO YOU'RE OKAY TO TRY OUT THE BASE GAME FIRST
I JUST LOOKED AT A FEW ONLINE AND I ENDED UP COMING ACROSS NATIONS ANY OPINIONS ON THAT ONE
PAX PORFIRIANA PAMIR
EMET 2 HRS PLAYERS IS A NEAT AREA CONTROL GAME THAT ALSO LOOKS AMAZING MINIATURES MYTHOLOGY CREATURES
SPHERES OF INFLUENCE STRUGGLE FOR GLOBAL SUPREMACY 2 HRS W NORMAL PLAYER COUNTS PLAYERS IS KIND OF LIKE RISK IT DOESN'T USE DICE THE COMBAT IS A LOT MORE INTERESTING IT HAS A ECONOMY SOME TERRITORIES HAVE MORE PRODUCTION SOME HAVE OIL SOME HAVE POINTS OF INTEREST OVERALL JUST A MUCH BETTER GAME THAN RISK ALSO IT CAN ACTUALLY PLAY UP TO PLAYERS TECHNICALLY ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT WITH MORE THAN AND I KNOW MOST GAMES THAT SCALE THAT HIGH TEND TO BOG DOWN WITH HIGHER PLAYER COUNTS WHO WANTS TO WAIT FOREVER FOR YOUR TURN TO COME AROUND
RAIDERS OF THE NORTH SEA HRS PLAYERS IS MY FAVORITE WORKER PLACEMENT GAME VIKINGS THEME RAIDING AND PILLAGING NEAT TWIST ON WORKER PLACEMENT WHERE YOU PLACE A WORKER AND THEN PICK UP A WORKER AND THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME BOARD I HAVE EVER SEEN PERIOD ALSO THERE'S AN EXPANSION IN THE WORKS

EDIT ADDED GAMEPLAY LENGTHS AND PLAYER COUNTS

EDIT 2 ALL OF THESE GAMES ARE ALL SPHERES OF INFLUENCE PROBABLY LENDS ITSELF THE MOST TO MAKING ALLIANCES
JAMIE HAS JUST NAILED THE PRODUCTION OF THESE VIDEOS REALLY HIT THE GROUND RUNNING
DELETED
I AM DEFINITELY LIKING THESE REVIEWS WITH JAMIE ALSO IT'S A REFRESHING CHANGE OF PACE TO NOT BE DELIVERING THE REVIEW IN FRONT OF THE STANDARD WALL OF GAMES BACKDROP
COOL TO SEE THIS GAME GETTING COVERAGE IT'S PRETTY UNIQUE COMPONENT QUALITY IS A LITTLE LOW AND THE STANDEES ARE KINDA STUPIDLY DESIGNED WITH THE NAMES ON THE BOTTOM AND VICIOUS FEET BUT THE STORY IT TELLS IS QUITE COOL
HAPPY TO SEE THIS GAME GETTING A GOOD REVIEW LOVE PLAYING IT MAYBE I WILL WIN SOMEDAY
AS WITH ANY HEAVIER GAME READ THE RULE BOOK FULLY AND BEFORE YOU TEACH IT TO OTHERS DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND SET UP THE GAME AND JUST TRY A FEW TURNS PLAYING A FEW DIFFERENT PLAYERS TO SEE HOW EACH OF THE ACTIONS WORK

THE RULE BOOK FOR TM IS PRETTY CLEAR AND THERE ARE ONLY A FEW TRICKY RULES HOW GAINING POWER WORKS MANAGING YOUR POWER SPECIAL POWERS ETC

THERE ARE A FEW VIDEO ON YOUTUBE SEARCH TERRA MYSTIC HOW TO PLAY THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW BEFORE READING THE RULES

WHEN TEACHING TERRA MYSTIC I DO IT LIKE SO

EXPLAIN THE PLAYER BOARD AND HOW IT WORKS HOW YOU UNCOVER NEW INCOME WHEN YOU BUILD DIFFERENT BUILDINGS AND THE WAY THE UPGRADING WORKS
2 EXPLAIN THE MAP AND HOW YOU CAN ONLY BUILD ON YOUR TERRAIN TYPE
EXPLAIN THE TERRAFORMING WHEEL COST ON YOUR PLAYER BOARD
EXPLAIN SHIPPING AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE MAP
USING THE PLAYER AID AS REFERENCE NOW EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT ACTIONS YOU CAN DO ON YOUR TURN I START FROM THE TOP AND EXPLAIN EACH SEPARATE ACTION IN DETAIL
EXPLAIN END GAME SCORING OF THE MAP AND TEMPLE TRACKS

THERE ARE SOME TEACHING SCRIPTS ON BG THAT ARE MUCH MORE DETAILED BUT I FOLLOW THAT GENERAL STRUCTURE WHENEVER I TEACH IT
READING THE RULES IT'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD
AAAAABI EXPLAINED THE PRECES WELL
ONE OTHER IMPORTANT THING IS TO STICK TO THE RACES THAT ARE SUGGESTED FOR THE FIRST GAMES AS OTHER MIGHT GET CONFUSING FOR A FIRST TIME PLAYERS
PLAY THE SOLITAIRE VERSION USE THE EXACT SAME RULES AS THE MAIN GAME FOR TWO PLAYERS EXCEPT WITH THIS VARIATION

AFTER YOU PASS PLACE ONE DWELLING OF ANOTHER COLOR ON ANY TILE ADJACENT TO ONE OF YOURS THEN YOU MAY CHOOSE TO COLLECT POWER AS IN THE RULES FOR PLACING STUFF

SEE IF YOU CAN GET AT LEAST POINTS WITH EVERY FACTION

COMMON RULES MISTAKES I SEE NEWIES MAKE IN TERRA MYSTIC

YOU TAKE A SPECIAL ACTION TILE AT THE START OF THE GAME

THE PLACEMENT FOR WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A TOWN AND THE LARGEST TOWN FOR BONUS POINTS HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS IF YOU NEED A REMINDER THINK OF BRIDGES WITH TOWNS AND SAILBOATS FOR BONUS POINTS NOT REALLY BUT SORT OF

THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO MAKE ANALOGIES ABOUT COLLECTING POWER FOR ADJACENCY FIND ONE THAT WORKS BEST FOR YOU AND OR YOUR GROUP I'M SURE USERS HERE HAVE HILARIOUS WAYS OF REMEMBERING THEM PROPERLY
TIME TO GO BROKE GENTLY STROKES WALLET YOU'VE BEEN A GOOD FRIEND BUT SOMETIMES SACRIFICES NEED TO BE MADE
THOSE CHOSE BLACK FRIDAY AS THE DAY OF THE RELAUNCH ISN'T THAT A LITTLE STRANGE
ESTIMATED SHIP DATE DECEMBER LOL
HMM IF THEY HAVE ANY NEW EXPANSIONS OR OTHER INTERESTING CONTENT IN THE KICKSTARTER I WILL BE BACKING IT FOR THOSE
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THIS MIGHT COST
IF I HAD THE MONEY I WOULD SADLY NOT AN OPTION FOR ME

SAHH KEEP IT QUIET SO IT'S EASIER TO GET THE DEALS
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME DOES IT START
I ALREADY OWN THE GAME BUT IF IT IS FOR A LOWER PRICE THAN THEIR RETAIL I WILL PROBABLY BUY A SECOND COPY MY RULE BOOK IS FALLING APART I WANT MORE ARMOR SETS I WANT MORE THAN OF SOME GEAR CARDS AND I WANT TO REPLACE A FEW CARDS THAT HAS SOME SCRATCHES FROM BEFORE I SLEEVED THEM BUT I HOPE AND EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE MORE THAN JUST THE BASE GAME
I'M THINKING OF THROWING MONEY AT A CORE SET BUT NOT SURE IF I CAN JUSTIFY THE PRICE OR NOT

WE PLAY A LOT OF P P RAGS ALREADY SO NOT SURE IF ADM WOULD OFFER MUCH MORE FOR THE CASH

GAME DOES LOOK GREAT THOUGH IS PROBABLY FANTASTIC FOR GROUPS THAT DON'T HAVE ANYONE WILLING OR ABLE TO DM
HOLD ON CAN YOU SEND A LINK OR CAN YOU DIRECT ME TO THE PROPER CHANNEL TO CHECK THIS OUT
TWIN SHADOWS ADDS ITS OWN CAMPAIGN WHICH IS SHORTER THAN THE CORE CAMPAIGN IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT IT IS A BETTER CAMPAIGN TO START WITH BECAUSE OF THE SHORTNESS AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID BUT YOU WOULD BE FINE PLAYING THE CORE CAMPAIGN IF MONEY IS AN ISSUE
EACH EXPANSION IS EITHER A FULL CAMPAIGN RETURN TO HOTH OR A MINI CAMPAIGN BESPIN GAMBIT TWIN SHADOWS

THE MINI CAMPAIGNS ARE SHORTER AND YOUR CHARACTERS START AT A HIGHER LEVEL THEY ARE GOOD FUN THE FULL CAMPAIGNS CORE GAME AND HOTH YOU START AT LEVEL AND ARE CONSIDERABLY LONGER YOU CAN USE MOST SIDE MISSIONS FROM ANY EXPANSION WITH ANY CAMPAIGN THERE ARE RULES FOR THIS IN RULEBOOK FOR THE EXPANSION YOU ARE PLAYING AND IT WILL TELL YOU WHAT SIDE MISSIONS CAN BE USED IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY EACH SIDE MISSION HAS A TIMING STATISTIC BASICALLY YOU FIND OUT WHAT ONES YOU CAN USE AND BUILD A SIDE MISSION DECK FOR THE CAMPAIGN

BESPIN GAMBIT ADDS CLOUD CITY TILES AND MISSIONS LANDO IS IN IT AS WELL AS A NEW IMPERIAL DECK AND 2 REBEL HEROES

TWIN SHADOWS ADDS TATTOOING STUFF BOBA FETT A NEW IMPERIAL DECK AND 2 REBEL HEROES

HOTH ADDS 2 IMPERIAL DECKS REBEL HEROES AND HOTH THEMED MINIS AND TILES

EACH EXPANSION ALSO ADDS A BUNCH OF STUFF FOR THE SKIRMISH GAME MODE

I'M ALSO LOOKING AT VAST FOR A VERY LONG TIME I'LL GET IT PROBABLY AS SOON AS IT COMES OUT ALSO CLANK LOOKS PRETTY GOOD WITH DECKBUILDING INVOLVED
MAYBE ARCADIA QUEST
IT IS KIND OF PVP AND AVE AT THE SAME TIME MAYBE SOMETHING YOU CAN CHECK
TOMB MAYBE I'M NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE GAMES YOU LISTED AND I NEVER SEE IT MENTIONED HERE SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT ITS RECEPTION
IT IS NOT FANTASY BUT THE NEW WALKING DEAD ALL OUT WAR GAME IS COMPETITIVE WITH GROUPS OF SURVIVORS TRYING TO SCAVENGE WHILE MANIPULATING NEUTRAL ZOMBIES INTO THE OTHER TEAMS GREAT FUN
EVERY DAY UNLESS I'M UNABLE ROAD TRIP ILLNESS ETC

YOU ALWAYS MAKE TIME FOR THE THINGS YOU LOVE

I PLAY ONCE A WEEK FOR SURE ON A TUESDAY NIGHT IN ADDITION I HAVE ONE SATURDAY A MONTH THAT'S AN ALL DAY GAME DAY I THEN OCCASIONALLY MANAGE TO GET IN ANOTHER GAME NIGHT SOMEWHERE DURING THE WEEK

I WOULD SAY I PLAY GAMES ENOUGH BUT THE THING IS I SELDOM GET TO PLAY GAMES I OWN THE HOST OF THE TUESDAY NIGHT SESSION GENERALLY SELECTS A GAME FROM HIS COLLECTION FOR EVERYONE TO PLAY IF WE GET TO PEOPLE WE'LL GENERALLY SPLIT INTO TWO GROUPS AND THEN I MIGHT GET SOMETHING I OWN TO THE TABLE WITH THE CAVEAT THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS TRYING TO DO THE SAME THE FULL DAY SATURDAY GAMES ARE ALSO EVERYONE BRINGING THEIR OWN GAMES TO PLAY WHICH MEANS I MAY GET 2 OR GAMES PLAYED THAT DAY DEPENDING ON EVERYONE'S MOOD WHETHER I WANT TO TEACH OR NOT AND IF EVERYONE WANTS TO PLAY A LONGER GAME MINS OR NOT

I'M SURPRISED HOW GOOD THIS LIST IS IT COVERS MANY OF THE BASES FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLAYERS LOTS OF FAMILY FRIENDLY STUFF AND THE RESISTANCE CARCASSONNE TIMELINE AND SURVIVE WILL ALL MAKE GOOD CHRISTMAS EVENING GAMES
I STAYED AWAY FROM THIS GAME FOR AWHILE SINCE MY WIFE DOESN'T LIKE DIRECT CONFRONTATION ENDED UP RECEIVING IT IN THE GENION MATH TRADE THIS YEAR SLIGHTLY SKEPTICAL BUT EVERY TIME WE'VE PLAYED IT EVERYONE HAS HAD AN ABSOLUTE BLAST MY TYPICALLY RESERVED SISTER IN LAW WENT FULL CHAOS MODE AFTER SOMEONE DESTROYED ONE OF HER FULL BOATS AND ATE EVERYONE ABOARD IT WAS AWESOME
LOVE THIS GAME FIRST PICKED IT UP BACK IN ON A CAMPING TRIP WITH MY MOM LOTS OF NOSTALGIA FOR ME EVERY ONE I'VE EVER INTRODUCED IT TO HAS LIKED LOVED IT
I RECEIVED THIS IN THE BOARDGAMES GIFT EXCHANGE THIS YEAR I LOVE HOW THE ISLAND DISAPPEARS AND THE BOARD GETS BUSY WITH SEA MONSTERS IT'S A FUN THEME
LIKE MANY OTHERS I THINK IT'S A GOOD GATEWAY GAME FOR INTRODUCING PEOPLE TO THE HOBBY THAT BEING SAID I'VE GROWN PRETTY TIRED OF IT I'VE SEEN WHAT THIS GAME HAS TO OFFER AND BESIDES ALL THE RANDOMNESS AND THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH TO IT I STILL RECOMMEND IT TO PEOPLE AND WOULDN'T REFUSE TO PLAY IT IF PEOPLE INSISTS
OK THIS IS ON MY LIST OF SHAME THANKFULLY THE LIST ISN'T TOO LONG I'VE HAD THIS ONE FOR ABOUT A YEAR BUT HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO BREAK IT OUT YET

HOPEFULLY THIS POST WILL PROD ME TO DO SO SOON
GREAT GAME GREAT GATEWAY BUT BE AWARE IT'S VERY CUTTHROAT OR SHOULD BE PLAYED AS SUCH

THIS GAME IS FREQUENTLY TOUTED AS A GOOD GAME FOR FAMILIES KIDS BUT I WOULD ONLY PLAY IT WITH KIDS THAT WERE MATURE GAMERS MOST KIDS WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE ALL THE VINDICTIVE PLAY
I LOVE THIS GAME I NEVER PLAY TO WIN THOUGH ONLY TO CAUSE UNTOLD AMOUNTS OF HAVOC THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED IT WITH FRIENDS THEY WERE LIKE WE CAN TRUST HIM ON THE BOAT I LAUGHED SO HARD AS I STEERED THAT BOAT STRAIGHT INTO A SEA SERPENT

I PICKED UP THE EXPANSIONS BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY JUST COMPLICATE A STREAMLINED AND WELL PACED GAME
MY GOTO PLAYER GAME TONS OF LAUGHS AND ENTERTAINMENT EVERY TIME IT HITS THE TABLE TURNS ARE SHORT AND EVERYONE STAYS ENGAGED THE GAME ALSO ENDS IN AROUND AN HOUR AND DOES NOT OVERSTAY ITS WELCOME
THEY NAMED THIS GAME WRONG THE REAL NAME IS FUCK YOU
THIS IS A VERY FUN GAME THAT FOR SOME REASON DOESN'T MAKE IT TO THE TABLE AS MUCH AS IT SHOULD I BELIEVE THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT IS VERY CUTTHROAT AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T DO WELL WITH THOSE TYPES OF GAMES BUT FOR PEOPLE THAT LOVE THAT DO IT IS ONE OF THE BEST

ALSO I GOT LUCKY AND FOUND COPIES OF THIS IN THRIFT STORES IN MONTHS ALL MILES APART FROM EACH OTHER WHEN I LIVED IN UTAH I HAVEN'T FOUND ANOTHER ONE SINCE IN THE OVER YEARS THAT I LIVED THERE
I LOVE THIS GAME THIS IS MY GO TO GAME FOR GETTING MY YOUNGER NIECES AND NEPHEWS INTO GAMING

LAST TIME WE PLAYED ONE OF MY NIECES KEPT DRIVING HER BOAT IN A CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN ONE OF MY NEPHEWS SENT A SEA MONSTER OVER TO SINK HER SHIP IT WAS QUITE FUN
MAKE SURE TO GET THE GIANT SQUIDS AND EXTRA PLAYERS EXPANSIONS FOR SURE


WE LOVE THIS GAME MY WIFE IS ALWAYS SO NON CONFRONTATIONAL WHEN SHE PLAYS THAT SHE MAKES EVERYONE ELSE FEEL BAD ABOUT KILLING HER SURVIVORS SO INSTEAD OF BEING THE ONLY ASS WHO GOES AFTER HER I JUST STARTED MAKING SURE I HAD ONE OF MY SURVIVORS IN ALL OF HER BOATS

IT'S AS EVERYONE ELSE SAID A GREAT GATEWAY GAME
LOVE IT SO MUCH GETS A LOT OF PLAY HAVE ALL MINI EXPANSIONS BUT IMO THE ONLY IS PLAYER A BECAUSE I REGULARLY HAVE AND B ORANGE
PLAYED IT AS A KID SO LOOKED FORWARD TO THE RARE NIGHTS MY PARENTS WOULD PLAY IT WITH ME I BOUGHT IT A FEW YEARS AGO AND SADLY HAVE ONLY PUT IT ON THE TABLE THREE TIMES BUT IT HAS BEEN WITH THREE GROUPS AND EACH GROUP LOVED IT SUCH A GOOD GAME
PICKED THIS UP AT A THRIFT STORE FOR A FEW EUROS THE COMPONENTS ALONE SEEM WORTH IT CHEERS FOR THIS
LOVE THE GAME EXCEPT FOR THE WHOLE SOME PEOPLE ARE WORTH MORE THAN OTHERS CONCEPT
LOVED IT AND PICKED UP THE EXPANSIONS LOVE THE CLOCK OF TILE REMOVAL AND YES VERY CUTTHROAT
ALL THE EXPANSIONS ARE MUST BUY IN MY OPINION GREAT GATEWAY GAME TONS OF PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE GONE OUT AND BOUGHT IT AFTER PLAYING IT
ALWAYS A DELIGHT TO PLAY LOVE IT
THIS IS A STAGE COINCIDENCE I JUST BOUGHT THIS FROM A CHARITY SHOP IN THE UK FOR POUND DIFFERENT COVER THOUGH IT IS A VERSION AND LOOKING ON EBAY WORTH A BIT OF CASH AFTER READING COMMENTS MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE IT A GAME BEFORE SELLING
EXTREMELY FUN GAME TO PLAY WITH KIDS MY YEAR OLD AND YEAR OLD LOVE THE THEME AND THEY'RE PRONE TO GIVING THEIR PEOPLE ELABORATE BACKSTORIES AND NARRATING THE GAME THEY DON'T PLAY PARTICULARLY STRATEGICALLY BUT THEY DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE LATENT SADISM
PROBABLY ONE OF MY MOST PLAYED GAMES ALWAYS FUN FOR CASUAL PEOPLE AND GOES ALONG WITH DRINKING QUITE WELL HAVENT RUN INTO ANYONE WHO DIDNT HAVE FUN PLAYING THIS EVEN AS CUT THROAT AS IT GETS
THIS IS KNOWN AS FEED MEEDLESS TO THE SHARKS GAME AT MY HOME IT'S DEFINITELY FUN BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME TAKE THAT INVOLVED IN THIS ONE
I LOVE THIS GAME I LOVED IT AS A KID AND I STILL LOVE IT WHICH IS A RARITY
I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME A LOT BUT I MISS THE ORIGINAL VERSION WITH ITS SMALLER PIECES STILL RECOMMENDED ITS VERY PLEASING TO EAT A FULL BOAT OF OPPONENTS
I HAVE THE HARBOR EXPANSION FOR THE REGULAR GAME BUT I FIGURE THE CARD IS THE SAME THE CITY HALL CARD IS A FREE LANDMARK FOR EACH PLAYER AT THE START OF THE GAME THAT IS WHY IT HAS THE YELLOW START BACK AND NOT AN UNBUILT LANDMARK BACK
THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE HELPFUL ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING YOU'RE AIMING TO HAVE A PHYSICAL BOARD ON WHICH TO PLAY

HAVE YOU HEARD OF HABITICA IT'S AN ONLINE RPG WHERE YOU CAN SET GOALS HABITS AND DAILY TASKS THAT YOU CAN TICK OFF TO GET REWARDS SUCH AS GOLD AND ITEMS YOU TRAIN YOUR CHARACTER BY COMPLETING TASKS AND LEVELLING UP FAIRLY STANDARD BUT UNFORTUNATELY REWARDS DON'T REALLY GIVE MUCH INCENTIVE TO KEEP ON GOING

HOWEVER WHAT YOU CAN DO IS ADD YOUR OWN REWARDS TO PURCHASE WITH THE COINS YOU GET FROM COMPLETING TASKS YOU COULD ADD ADD TO BOARD GAMES BUDGET AS A REWARD WHICH YOU CAN BUY OVER AND OVER WHEN YOU'VE SAVED ENOUGH FROM YOUR HABITS TASKS AND COMPLETED GOALS

YOU WON'T HAVE A PHYSICAL BOARD BUT YOU WILL HAVE THE PHYSICAL FEEDBACK AND BEING ABLE TO ACCESS IT THROUGH ANY BROWSER WILL MEAN YOU CAN STILL KEEP TRACK EVEN IF YOU'RE AWAY FROM HOME
READ IT STOPPED TEXTED F DOING THE SAME THING THANKS
HAVE YOU HEARD OF SUPERBETTER I RECENTLY RENTED THE BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY AND IT GIVES YOU DIFFERENT WAYS TO OVERCOME ANXIETY REINFORCE YOUR SOCIAL NETWORK BECOME MORE EFFICIENT ETC BY LIVING BLAMEFULLY

IF YOU NEED AN EXCUSE TO PLAY GAMES LIKE TERRIS BEJEWELED AND PATCHWORK TELL THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE OVERCOMING SOMETHING TRAUMATIC APPARENTLY THERE'S SCIENTIFIC PROOF THAT THESE GAMES HELP
TYRANTS OF THE UNDERMARK FOR SEEMS GOOOOOOOD

DELETED
VERY GOOD A GOOD PRICE ON IMPERIAL ASSAULT IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU AND AN CORE SET IF YOU LIKE CHEAP ENTRY INTO THE WORLD OF SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY THE REST IS PRETTY CRAP
I WANT IMPERIAL ASSAULT SO BAD ESPECIALLY AT THAT PRICE MY ONLY PROBLEM IS WILL I GET IT TO THE TABLE ENOUGH SADLY DUE TO WORK SCHEDULES I DON'T HAVE REGULAR WEEKLY GAME NIGHTS BIWEEKLY IF I'M LUCKY AND I HEAR AI REQUIRES SOME DEDICATION
I BIT I PICKED UP PANDEMIC REIGN AND ABOVE AND BELOW WHICH WERE BOTH ON MY LIST THREW IN STOCKING STUFFERS THAT HAD LOW STOCK I AM OFFICIALLY DONE NO MORE NEED TO WATCH BLACK FRIDAY SALES
THERE ARE LIKE BOARD GAMES AND OUT OF THAT ONLY IMPERIAL ASSAULT AND ABOVE AND BELOW SEEM ANYTHING WORTH MENTIONING
WHAT DOES PRE BLACK FRIDAY MEAN WILL THERE BE A SEPARATE LIST OF ITEMS ON SALE ON BLACK FRIDAY
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ELSE ABOUT IT BUT VOLT ROBOT BATTLE ARENA IS BY EMERSON MATSUUCHI OF SPECTER OPS FAME DEFINITELY LOOKING INTO THIS ONE
DICE MASTERS FALERN UNDER SEIGE IS ONE OF THE BEST SETS TO OWN ALONG WITH A STARTER IF YOU WANT A SIMPLE STANDALONE SET FOR IT WARNING IF YOU DON'T LIKE MTG YOU WON'T LIKE DICE MASTERS
AND THEY ALREADY HAVE MY STUFF IN TRANSIT AMAZING HANDLING OF THIS SALE CSI WISH EVERY COMPANY WAS THIS AMAZING
ANYONE IN CANADA EVER BUY FROM COOLSTUFF WHAT IS THERE SHIPPING COSTS LIKE

SOME GOOD DEALS BUT WONDERING IF IT WOULD BE WORTH IT WITH THE EXCHANGE RATE AND SHIPPING MY GUESS IS PROBABLY NOT

THE CHANCES OF ME GETTING ANY OF MY GAMES PLAYED TIMES IN ONE YEAR IS SLIM JUST DUE TO THE NATURE OF HOW MY GAME GROUPS OPERATE WHICH IS FINE BUT THERE'S A FEW GAMES I THINK I'D LIKE TO GET PLAYED MORE OFTEN AND WHO'S RELATIVELY LIGHT NATURE MIGHT LEND THEM TO BEING PLAYED MORE OFTEN INCLUDING

QUADROPOLIS
VIA NEBULA
HONSHU

OBVIOUSLY I'M A EURO GAMER PROBLEM IS NOBODY AROUND ME IS OF MY DIMES THIS YEAR ARE SOLO GAMES ONE IS PANDEMIC LEGACY AND ONE IS CRIBBAGE THE ONLY GAME MY WIFE WILL PLAY WITH ANY REGULARITY SAD FACE
I'M DOING ALL GAMES CHALLENGE AND I'M ALMOST DONE PLAYS LEFT FROM MY COLLECTION OF GAMES
IS THERE AN EASY WAY TO LOOK BACK THROUGH PAST COMMENTS I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND MY I POSTED IN FEBRUARY
BORA BORA ALL THE WAY BEAUTIFUL AND FUN TO PLAY TRAJAN IS GOOD BUT A BIT DRY
IF YOU LOVE CASTLES BORA BORA IS OFTEN CITED AS A MORE COMPLICATED VERSION OF THE MECHANICS THIS DOES NOT MEAN IT IS BETTER CASTLES IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE THE SUPERIOR DESIGN

TRAJAN CAN FEEL LIKE A COLLECTION OF MANY GAMES PLAYED AT ONCE AND IF YOU LIKE THE IDEA OF MANAGING MANY INTERLOCKING PIECES TO MASTER A FULL MACHINE THIS WOULD BE A GOOD GAME TO TRY A VERY DIVISIVE GAME MANY PEOPLE THINK THIS IS EITHER BEST OR CONVERSELY HIS MOST OVERRATED GAME

LA ISLA IS ONE OF HIS LIGHTEST GAMES IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT IS EASIER TO GRASP AND TEACH TO OTHERS THIS MIGHT BE GOOD IT IS NOT NEARLY AS SATISFYING AS HIS MEATIER GAMES IN TERMS OF STRATEGY


SPECIAL NOTE TWO OF MOST POPULAR GAMES IN THE HEAVY EURO COMMUNITY IN THE YEAR OF THE DRAGON AND NOTRE DAME ARE RECEIVING REPRINTS IN AND ARE DEFINITELY WORTH WAITING FOR BASED ON PAST PRICES THEY SHOULD RETAIL FOR SLIGHTLY OVER
I HAVEN'T PLAYED ALL HIS GAMES BUT MY FAVORITE IS AQUASPHERE WHICH YOU CAN USUALLY FIND A PRETTY GOOD DEAL ON
ASIDE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ALREADY SINCE NOBODY TACKLED LA ISLA I WILLIAM IT'S A FUN MIDDLE WEIGHT GAME WITH A GOOD BIT OF DEPTH FOR THE DOLLAR PRICE I THINK IT USUALLY GOES FOR ONLINE IT'S A GREAT PSEUDO SET COLLECTION GAME THERE'S ENOUGH WITH PLACEMENT ON THE BOARD AND THE ABILITIES ON CARDS TO KEEP IT REFRESHING FOR A NUMBER OF PLAYS I LIKE IT MORE THAN RIALTO WHICH IS MECHANICALLY DIFFERENT BUT ROUGHLY THE SAME IN COMPLEXITY AND LENGTH
ORACLE OF DELPHI IS THE FIRST FELD I WILL KEEP IN MY COLLECTION IT'S A WONDERFULLY PUZZLE PICKUP AND DELIVER RACE GAME I AM NOT TYPICALLY A BIG FAN OF EITHER PICKUP AND DELIVER OR RACE GAMES BUT THIS ONE DOES IT RIGHT THE DICE PLAY MANIPULATION AND UNIQUE CHARACTER POWERS REMIND ME OF THE VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO ANOTHER FAVOURITE OF OURS

I ALSO QUITE ENJOY THE THEME AND HOW IT TIES BACK TO THE GAMEPLAY SOMETHING I FIND ABSENT IN OTHER GAMES
JUST TOSSING OUT SOME INFO HERE BUT IF YOU ARE WILLING TO WAIT A MONTH OR SO JÓRVÍK IS GETTING PRINTED ITS A RESKIN OF SPEICHERSTADT KAISPEICHER
TO ME BORA BORA IS THE MOST EPIC CUTTHROAT AND ALSO FIDDLY THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF BLOCKING THE PERSONAL GOALS MAKE IT FEEL EPIC AND TIE ALL THE MINI GAMES TOGETHER REALLY WELL I LOVE THE PERSONAL GOALS TRAJAN AT 2 PLAYER IS LESS CUTTHROAT AND THE MANCALA IN EFFECT TAKES ON THE FEEL OF AN ENGINE BUILDER TO ME BECAUSE IDEALLY YOU ARE DEVELOPING A SEQUENCE OF MOVES THAT CHAIN TOGETHER BY READING INTO THE FUTURE OF YOUR MANCALA IT'S A FUN THINKER IN THAT WAY PERSONALLY I LOVE AQUASPHERE AT 2 IT'S A MUCH MORE RESTRICTIVE AND UNFORGIVING GAME THAN BORA BORA OR TRAJAN IN THE SENSE THAT IF YOU AREN'T PLANNING AHEAD WELL YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF IN SITUATIONS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE NOTHING YOU CAN DO BUT I DARE SAY IT'S THE MOST ELEGANT OF THE MANY INTERCONNECTED ELEMENTS WITH A CALCULATED DANCE FEEL LIKE CHESS THE SMALL MOVES OF PROGRAMMING BOTS FEELS LIKE POSITIONING A PAWN TO ME AND IF PLAYED WELL THERE'S LOTS OF INTERACTION YOU EITHER MUST OR ARE VERY TEMPTED TO RESPOND TO WHAT YOUR OPPONENT IS DOING JUST TRYING TO GIVE SOME IMPRESSIONS OF HOW THEY FEEL TO ENGAGE WITH AT 2 PLAYER

UNLIKE AND ARMADA WHICH FEEL LIKE TASTERS FOR A MUCH BIGGER GAME IMPERIAL ASSAULT REALLY DOES FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GETTING A HELL OF A LOT OF GAME RIGHT OUT OF THAT ONE BOX SHOULD KEEP YOU GOING FOR A LONG TIME PLUS THERE'S AN INCOMING APP FOR CO-OP CAMPAIGNING NEXT YEAR
THERE IS A FULLY PLAYABLE CAMPAIGN AND SKIRMISH MODE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX AND YOU LOSE NOTHING OTHER THAN HAVING TO USE CARDBOARD TOKENS FOR THE IMPERIAL BOSSES ADDITIONAL PURCHASES GRANT YOU NEW SKIRMISH MAPS MORE MINIS AND MORE STUFF FOR YOU AND YOUR PLAYERS TO USE DURING YOUR CAMPAIGN YOU CERTAINLY DO NOT LOSE OUT ON ANYTHING ASIDE FROM A BROADER POOL OF CHOICES BY NOT BUYING INTO THE EXPANSIONS
SO A RESOUNDING YES THANKS GUYS
I HAD THE SAME FEAR AS YOU WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED IMPERIAL ASSAULT I WAS CONCERNED THAT WITH CONSTANT RELEASE OF FIGURES AND EXPANSIONS I WOULD BE COMPELLED TO BUY THEM ALL AND PUT WAY TOO MUCH MONEY INTO IT OR I WOULD FEEL LIKE I'M NOT GETTING THE FULL GAME

I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE BASE GAME HAS TONS OF REPLAY VALUE AND AS OTHER POSTERS HAVE MENTIONED YOU ARE DEFINITELY NOT MISSING ANYTHING CRITICAL ESPECIALLY IF YOU WILL PRIMARILY BE PLAYING THE CAMPAIGN DON'T FEEL RUSHED TO HAVE THE COMPLETE SET UNLESS YOU PLAN ON PLAYING COMPETITIVE SKIRMISH
YES
SO YOU GET CARDBOARD TOKENS FOR SOME OF THE MAIN ENEMIES THAT YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO UPGRADE TO PLASTIC WITH LIKE OF PACKS BUT THAT SAID THE CAMPAIGN IS MY FAVORITE PART THE ONLY PART I PLAY ANYMORE THE BASE GAME HAS ENOUGH CAMPAIGN FOR PROBABLY COUPLE HOUR SESSIONS AND YOU'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY PLUS THEN YOU'LL KNOW IF YOU WANT A BIG BOX EXPANSION
I'VE BOUGHT THE BASE GAME AND PLAYED THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN ONCE AND DID NOT THINK THAT IT LACKED ANYTHING AS IT PROVIDED A FUN EXPERIENCE AND I'M EVEN CONSIDERING RUNNING THROUGH THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN A SECOND TIME AS WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THE BASE GAME IS HIGHLY REPAYABLE THERE ARE SOME MISSIONS IN THE BASE GAME AND YOU ONLY PLAY THROUGH OF THEM IN A CAMPAIGN
I ACTUALLY REGRET HOW MUCH STUFF I BOUGHT BEFORE PLAYING I GOT ALMOST EVER MINI EXPANSION AND OF THEM NEVER EVEN CAME UP IN MY CAMPAIGN IT IS A BIT SILLY HAVING LITTLE CARDBOARD CIRCLES REPRESENT HAN SOLO WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS A PLASTIC FIGURE BUT IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL

IF YOU LIKE IT ENOUGH TO PLAY MULTIPLE TIMES IT WOULD BE WORTH INVESTING IN FOR VARIABILITY AND TO GET SOME FUN FIGURES THOUGH PERSONALLY THE GAME WASN'T REALLY FOR ME SO I BLEW MY MONEY FOR NOTHING
I KINDA THINK LEVEL OMEGA IS HE BETTER CHOICE IF YOU JUST ARE GOING WITH BASE GAMES
CORE SET ON IT'S OWN SHOULD BE FINE I WENT DOWN A DEEP RABBIT HOLE WITH DESCENT AND WHILE THE ADDITIONAL BOXES WERE FUN AND THE EXTRA BITS APPRECIATED I KINDA WISH I HAD JUST STUCK WITH THE CORE AND PUT THAT MONEY INTO SOMETHING ELSE
I'VE HAD IT FOR A GOOD MONTHS NOW AT LEAST AND THE ONLY EXTRA CONTENT I BOUGHT WAS THE BOBA FETT FIGURE PACK

AND I CAN SAY THAT I LOVE IT I'VE NEVER THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT IT'S MISSING ANYTHING OR NEEDS MORE BUT I HAVE WANTED MORE LOL

SO NO IT'S NOT NECESSARY BY ANY MEANS BUT IF YOU'RE NOT STRONG YOU'LL PROBABLY END UP BUYING MORE EVENTUALLY
IF YOU'RE PLAYING CAMPAIGN THEN YES THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH GAME THERE MOST OF THE EXPANSION STUFF IS MORE GEARED TOWARDS SKIRMISH PLAY
I HAVE PLAYED THE FULL CAMPAIGN TWICE WITH NOTHING BUT THE BASE SET AND WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED ONLY NOW AM I CONSIDERING GETTING ONE OF THE BIG BOX EXPANSIONS FOR SOME MORE VARIETY NOTE I HAVE NOT PLAYED SKIRMISH
DEFINITELY THE CORE SET HAS SO MUCH GAME IN IT
THANKS FOR ASKING THIS QUESTION I WAS WONDERING THIS MYSELF AND HAVE BEEN WANTING TO GET THIS GAME
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IN THE BOX WILL GIVE MANY HOURS OF CAMPAIGN PLAY FOR A DECENT NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE EXTRAS ARE ALL EXACTLY THAT UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO INTO COMPETITIVE SKIRMISH
YES IT IS A COMPLETE GAME RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX AND IT WILL TAKE YOU SOME TIME TO GET THROUGH A CAMPAIGN
I HAD A GROUP START GOING THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN WE'RE MISSIONS IN NOW AND FRANKLY I DON'T EVEN SEE A COMPELLING REASON TO BUY ANY OF THE ADDITION PACKS SETS WE'RE NOT PLAYING SKIRMISH MODE AT ALL AND WE'VE ALREADY BUILT THE MISSION DECKS MANY OF THE EXPANSIONS DO ADD EXTRA SIDE QUEST MISSIONS HOWEVER YOU WILL ONLY PLAY THROUGH A SMALL NUMBER OF THOSE DURING A SINGLE CAMPAIGN I THINK I GOT MY COPY OF THE BASE GAME IN A TRADE AND THINK THE BASE GAME IS WELL WORTH IT


I JUST POSTED ABOUT THIS BUT CAN ANYONE HERE TELL ME WHAT ALLY PACKS I WOULD NEED TO GET IF I WANTED TO REPLACE ALL THE TOKENS IN THE BASE GAME
CARDANUS HAS GREAT PRICES GREAT DISCOUNTS GREAT DING AND DENT PROGRAM GREAT STOCK AND SERVICE BUT MAN THIS WEBSITE PAINS ME EVERY TIME I HAVE TO USE IT I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO CLICK THROUGH PAGES
I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON THIS I JUST PLACED AN ORDER FOR ISTANBUL CONCORDIA ONITAMA LANTERNS THE HARVEST FESTIVAL AND CACAO FOR AN EVEN AND FREE SHIPPING WOO
OFF TOO
TERRA MYSTIC FOR AND FOR ARE GREAT PRICES
THANKS SO MUCH FOR POSTING THIS CARDANUS IS TYPICALLY MY ONLINE STORE OF CHOICE AND THEIR LOW PRICES FREE SHIPPING IF YOU GO OVER NO SALES TAX AND THE BF DISCOUNT MADE IT WORTH IT FOR ME TO PLACE A LARGE ORDER JUST NOW ALSO THE ADDED BENEFIT NOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR BF SALES ANY LONGER AT LEAST WHEN IT COMES TO BOARD GAMES
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT YOU COULD CHECK OUT MANSIONS OF MADNESS SECOND EDITION AND THE ROAD TO LEGEND APP FOR DESCENT BOTH ARE FROM FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES AND AVAILABLE ON ANDROID
PSIG THIS OR A FEAST FOR ODIN

TABLETOPPERS RANGE FROM THE CASUAL CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY PLAYER TO THE PANDEMIC LEGACY PLAYER TO THE PLAYER WE LIE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THE FIRST TWO

OH GOD WHAT DOES THIS EVEN MEAN ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY IND IS THE HEAVIEST POSSIBLE BOARD GAME


MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE CREATED I HAVE NO OTHER POLITE WORDS
NOT MY KIND OF GAME WHATSOEVER BUT CONGRATS ON REACHING YOUR FUNDING GOAL
I I'M LOST FOR WORDS
GOOD LUCK WITH THE GAME THIS LOOKS ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE EXPLODING KITTENS
WHO BACKS THIS
THAT ART ALL LOOKS LIFTED FROM THE INTERNET DO YOU HAVE RIGHTS ON IT
TO BE HONEST I'M KINDA DISAPPOINTED IN THE LEVEL OF DERISION YOU'RE RECEIVING IN THIS THREAD AND I'M IMPRESSED BY HOW YOU'VE RESPONDED TO IT WITH A COOL HEAD

FROM THE SOUND OF IT THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT THE GAME FOR ME THE MECHANICS DON'T GRAB ME AND THESE DAYS I FIND EXCESSIVE USAGE OF MEMES TIRESOME ESPECIALLY OUTSIDE OF THE INTERNET I CAN SAY WITH SOME CONFIDENCE THAT I PROBABLY WOULDN'T ENJOY THIS

BUT I THINK CRITICISM IS NOT THE SAME AS DERISION AND I'M SORRY YOU'RE RECEIVING SO MUCH OF THE LATTER CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FUNDING I HOPE YOU RECEIVE GOOD CRITICISM IN ADDITION TO THE YOU CAN CONTINUE TO GROW AS A DESIGNER
MYTHIC BATTLES PANTHEON IS EASILY ONE OF THE MOST PROFESSIONALLY HANDLED KS I'VE BACKED SO FAR THE MINIS ARE GORGEOUS AND THE GAMEPLAY LOOKS INTERESTING AS WELL NOT TO MENTION YOU DEFINITELY GET MORE THAN YOU PAY FOR THAT FREE TITAN MINIATURE IS AMAZING HAHA
I'M A BACKER AS WELL JUST FOR THE PLASTIC IT WILL BE EASY ENOUGH TO USE THE MINIS IN ANOTHER GAME SYSTEM HOWEVER IF THIS WAS THE ONLY GAME I WAS GETTING FOR DUNGEON CRAWLING TACTICAL COMBAT OR WHATEVER I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND DS AS THE GAME OF CHOICE TO SCRATCH THAT ITCH FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR
I BACKED DS FOR BUT WILL DEFINITELY NOT UP MY PLEDGE THE GAME LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEING PUT TOGETHER BETWEEN UPDATES IT'S TOO MUCH OF AN INVESTMENT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

MYTHIC BATTLES PANTHEON ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE SECOND ITERATION OF THE GAME THE ORIGINAL BEING A TOKEN BASED GAME CALLED MYTHIC BATTLES IF ANYTHING I WOULD GO FOR MB P MAY AS WELL GET A GAME WITH THOROUGHLY TESTED GAMEPLAY
GUESS I'LL STAND UP FOR DARK SOULS THEN PERSONALLY I HAVE LOVED WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR OF SOULS THE COMBAT LOOKS VERY TACTICAL AND THE ONLY THINGS THEY'VE REALLY BEEN CHANGING ARE THE SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW THAT COMBAT TO HAPPEN AND THINGS LIKE TRAPS WHICH USED BACKER INPUT EVERY PERSON WHO HAS DEMODE THE GAME AT CONVENTIONS HAS SAID ITS GREAT TO PLAY

THAT'S ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT GAME STYLES ONE IS A MINIATURE SKIRMISH GAME THE OTHER A DUNGEON CRAWL IF YOU ARE SIMPLY BACKING FOR THE PLASTIC THEN GO FOR MYTHIC THEN AGAIN YOU GET A LOT OF MINIS WHICH DS TOO IF LIKE ME YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GAME TO PLAY THEN DECIDE WHICH STYLE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR

ALSO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN THE UPDATE BUT THEY ARE RUNNING A 2 HOUR GAME PLAY STREAM FOR DARK SOULS TOMORROW SO YOU MIGHT BE A BIT PREMATURE IN MAKING ANY DECISION UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THAT
I JUST DO A FEW OVERHANDS AND GENERALLY DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH

OR PUT THEM ALL FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE AND MIX THEM AROUND
MASH SHUFFLES EASIER IF SLEEVED AND PILE SHUFFLES
I GET TWO PEOPLE TO SHUFFLE EACH DECK ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN GAMES WHERE YOU HAVE TO SHUFFLE DECKS OF OR CARDS IT STOPS THE FIRST PERSON SUBCONSCIOUSLY KNOWING WHERE CARDS ARE IN THE DECK
THROW THEM ALL UP IN THE AIR AND THEN PICK THEM ALL UP
I PREFER TO SCATTER SHUFFLE DEAL OUT THE CARDS FACE DOWN IN ANY NUMBER OF PILES DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE DECK PICK UP THE PILES AND STACK THEM IN ANY ORDER DO THAT ONCE OR TWICE AND YOU'RE GOLDEN
FISHER YATES SHUFFLE AND A GOOD SOURCE OF ENTROPY FOR YOUR ANG
FEAST NOW MY BROTHERS
GRR THEY DID JACK THE PRICE I MEAN I CAN'T BLAME THEM THE GAME IS SELLING LIKE HOT CAKES SO MORE POWER TO THEM

I THINK I CAN WAIT A FEW MORE MONTHS I'M GUESSING IT WILL BE ON SALE AGAIN AT SOME POINT OR ONCE THE RUSH DIES DOWN

IT ALSO HELPS THAT MY FRIEND HAS A COPY THAT I'LL PROBABLY PLAY SEVERAL MORE TIMES IN THE COMING WEEKS

BUT IT IS A GREAT GAME I'LL GET IT SOMEDAY
HA BEAT ME TO IT SAW IT BEFORE I LEFT FOR WORK AN HOUR AGO ORDERED POPPED IN HERE TO MAKE A TOPIC AND DIDN'T SEE YOURS TILL AFTER I HAD DOING THE LORD'S WORK
ORDERED IT MAY BE WORTH IT FOR SOME TO USE CARDANUS TEN PERCENT OFF SALE WHICH I'M TOLD BEGINS TODAY GAME IS THERE SO LIKE WITH THE SALE BUT YOU HAVE TO GET TO FOR FREE SHIPPING

I GOT OFF AT CSI SO IT WAS WORTH IT FOR ME WITH THE MINIMUM FOR SHIPPING
SEES THAT A FEAST FOR ODIN IS BACK ON COOLSTUFF BIKES MILES IN THE RAIN THE DAY BEFORE THANKSGIVING TO FLAGS TO BUY
THANKS FOR THE TIP FANTASTIC GAME JUST PICKED UP A SECOND COPY TO GIVE AS A GIFT
RISK LEGACY THE FIRST SUCH LEGACY BOARD GAME WAS DESIGNED SO THE BOX OPENED ON A HINGE LIKE A BRIEFCASE THAT'S NOT THE POINT WHAT WAS BRILLIANT WAS THAT THEY HAD PLACED A STICKER NOT AN EASILY REMOVABLE ONE ON THE EDGE OF THE BOX WHERE THE LID FULLY CLOSES

THE SEAL SAYS
WARNING
WHAT IS DONE CANNOT BE UNDONE

IN ORDER TO OPEN THE GAME YOU ARE REQUIRED TO BREAK THAT SEAL

THIS IS INCREDIBLE FROM A DESIGN STANDPOINT BECAUSE IT EMBODIES THE ENTIRE THEME OF THE LEGACY ASPECT OF THE GAME WHERE THE RESULTS OF ACTIONS TAKEN IN ONE GAME PERSIST AND AFFECT FUTURE GAMES
I AM A FAN OF THE KNIERIM 2ND EDITION BOX THE INSIDE IS NICE AND I LIKED THE CLASSIC GAMES IN THE WOODEN BOXES THAT LOOKED LIKE BOOKS THAT'S HOW MY STRATEGE IS BUT THEY HAVE RISK AND MONOPOLY AND STUFF LIKE THAT

NOW A POSSIBLE UNPOPULAR OPINION THE FFA COFFIN CASES THE HUGE BOXES LIKE DESCENT STARCRAFT OR TWILIGHT EMPORIUM I LOVED THOSE DAMNED THING
MAFIA DE CUBA IS PRETTY COOL BECAUSE THE BOX IS PART OF THE GAMEPLAY IT'S A CIGAR BOX WITH A FALSE BOTTOM THAT THE PLAYERS LIFT UP TO PICK THEIR ROLE OR STEAL THE DIAMONDS
BURGLE BROS SHOULD GET AN AWARD FOR PACKING EVERYTHING INTO THE BOX WITH NO AIR AT ALL IT'S GENUINELY IMPRESSIVE
I THINK THE GRIMOIRE WOOD BOX OF WAR OF THE RING COLLECTOR'S EDITION IS PROBABLY THE ONE I'D GO WITH AND I WISH I HADN'T MISSED OUR ON IT

NOT WHAT YOU PROBABLY MEAN BUT I REALLY LIKE THE SIERRA MADRE GAMES SMALL BOXES LATELY THEY PACK THE CONTENTS TIGHT IN THERE AND YOU GET A LOT OF GAME PLAY IT IS THE ANTITHESIS OF THE LIGHT GAME IN A BOX FULL OF AIR MY EXAMPLE IF THIS WOULD BE NATIONS
COOL PACKAGING EXCITES ME IT'S MY JOB STAR WARS DESTINY STARTER SETS ARE SUPER EXCITING I LOVE THE PRECISION THE USEFULNESS THE REUSABILITY
KYTHE IT HAS A MOP-UP BOARD LIKE A STORYBOOK MOP-UP
ONITAMA HAS A COOL BOX PACKAGING
I LOVE THE SECRET HITLER PACKAGING WHEN PLAYING IT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THE GROUP I WAS WITH ASKED IF IT WAS AN OLD GAME BECAUSE OF THE PACKAGING

THE WOODEN BOX MAKES IT EVEN MORE AWESOME
THE NEW HARRY POTTER DECK BUILDING GAME YOU START OUT BY OPENING ONE OF SEVEN BOXES THAT CORRESPOND TO THE INDIVIDUAL BOOKS INSIDE ARE CARDS FOR A BASIC GAME ONCE YOU LEARN THE RULES IT'S ON TO BOOK 2 AND THE SECOND COMPONENT BOX AND SO ON

ON TOP OF THIS THERE IS A NICE INSERT WITH SPOTS TO STORE ALL THE PARTS

PROPS TO LORDS OF WATERDEEP AS WELL FOR ITS PART STORAGE INSERT
SO FOR CURRENCY STEEPLE SOURCE AND CAMPAIGN COINS HAVE METAL COINS OF VARIOUS DENOMINATIONS
FOR CARDS AND PIECES THE GAME CRAFTER LETS YOU MAKE CUSTOM CARDS AND BUY PARTS THEY ARE OK QUALITY
DRIVE THRU CARDS ALSO DOES CUSTOM CARDS
NT NO LINKS SINCE I'M AT WORK AND CAN'T GET AROUND THE FIREWALL
ACQUIRE IS MY FAVORITE GAME AND THIS LOOKS AWESOME HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO CUSTOM POKER CHIPS FOR MONEY THEY MAKE TRANSACTIONS A BIT FASTER I SECOND USING ONE OF THE ONLINE CARD COMPANIES FOR THE STOCKS THEY ARE TYPICALLY STANDARD PLAYING CARD SIZE SOME HAVE TEMPLATES WHERE YOU CAN DROP IN IMAGE FILES WHICH MAKES DESIGN PRETTY EASY AS FOR THE COMPANY MARKERS MAYBE JUST PUT A SMALL SQUARE RECTANGULAR DOWEL ON THE BOTTOM OF EACH MARKER WHICH WILL FIT BETWEEN TWO TILES SNUGLY
I LIKE THAT EVERYTHING YOU DO FEELS THEMATIC AND IT NEVER REALLY FEELS CONFLICT WE ALL JUST FOCUS ON OUR BUSINESS AND SEE WHO WINS I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE COMPLAINTS ABOUT HOW THE GAME ACTUALLY ENDS BUT IT HASN'T BEEN A PROBLEM FOR US YET I DO WONDER IF THE COMMUNITY HAS ANY VARIANTS TO SOLVE THIS OR NOT
LIKE U SHINEUPONTHEE SAID THE THEME SHINES REALLY HEAVILY IN THIS GAME I LOVE AGING THE GRAPES I LOVE PLANTING CARDS I LOVE THE DIFFERENT SEASONS ALLOWING DISALLOWING YOU TO DO CERTAIN THINGS I LOVE THE COMPONENTS ESPECIALLY THE GRAPES I LOVE THE HAND AND MONEY MANAGEMENT I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS GAME

THE GRAPE COMPONENTS MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE THING THAT'S NOT TO DISMISS THE REST OF THE GAME I JUST THINK THEY'RE SPECTACULAR

IF YOU END UP ENJOYING THIS GAME I'D RECOMMEND TUSCANY EE BECAUSE MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT THAT GAME IS ACTUALLY THE PERSONAL CUSTOMIZATION YOU CAN DO WITH THE STRUCTURE CARDS IT ADDS A LOT TO THE GAME THAT I THINK MAKES IT EVEN BETTER THAN IT ALREADY IS
MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT VITICULTURE IS THAT ROOSTER STEEPLE
I LIKE THE WORKER PLACEMENT MECHANICS YOU HAVE A SMALL POOL OF WORKERS AND DIFFERENT ACTIONS FOR DIFFERENT SEASONS AND MULTIPLE SPOTS THAT MAY BE USED DEPENDING ON PLAYER COUNT YOU COULD EASILY USE THEM UP TO SOON AND NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO DO WORK LATER IN THE YEAR OR YOU COULD BE STINGY AND THEN GET BLOCKED MEANING YOU ONLY GET TO BUT A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY AS COMPENSATION FOR THE LOST ACTIONS

OF COURSE I PLAY THE ORIGINAL EDITION WITH THE TUSCANY EXPANSION AND THUS USE A SEASON BOARD I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TITLES THAT REALLY NEEDS THE EXPANSION TO MAKE IT FEEL COMPLETE OR MAKE IT REPAYABLE LIKE PANDEMIC ON THE BRINK OR ELDRITCH HORROR FORSAKEN LORE OR UM CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY LOTS AND LOTS OF ALCOHOL SHAME I DON'T DRINK
AS SOMEONE WHO USED TO WORK AT FAGS THIS CAN HAPPEN QUITE A BIT DEPENDING ON WHO THEY DEAL WITH I REMEMBER CODENAMES BEING ON BACKORDER
VITICULTURE WAS IN BETWEEN PRINTINGS FOR MONTHS MANSIONS OF MADNESS RAN OUT ALMOST EVERYWHERE IN THE LAST WEEK AND A HALF IF YOUR AGS ONLY USES ONE OR TWO DISTRIBUTORS AND DOESN'T OFTEN SHIP FROM OTHER WAREHOUSES THIS CAN BE TOTALLY LEGIT HOWEVER MANSIONS WAS PRETTY READILY AVAILABLE BEFORE THAT SO I'M NOT SURE IF I BUY THAT REASONING BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO IS THEIR SUPPLIER AND HOW OFTEN THEY ORDER


I HAVEN'T PLAYED TYRANTS MYSELF BUT FROM WATCHING GRAY ELEPHANT PLAY OF IT I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS REASONABLE IT REWARDED EVERY ASPECT OF THE GAME I DON'T SEE THE ISSUE WITH A PLAYER WINNING IF HE IS THE ONLY ONE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A SOURCE OF POINTS
I'VE PLAYED THE GAME DOZENS OF TIMES AND I THINK YOUR SUGGESTED CHANGES WOULD MAKE THE GAME WORSE

THIS ISN'T JUST AN AREA CONTROL GAME CARD BUYS AND PROMOTIONS PROVIDE ALTERNATE PATHS TO VICTORY GIVING THE GAME MUCH MORE VARIETY IT WOULD GET BORING FAST IF ALL YOU WERE DOING WAS JUST FIGHTING FOR LOCATIONS WITH SUPER STRAIGHTFORWARD CARDPLAYER

NOT KNOWING WHAT FOLKS EXACTLY HAVE SCORED IS ALSO PART OF THE FUN IT WOULD BE VERY TEDIOUS IF YOU COULD COUNT UP SOMEONE'S POINTS AND SAY HEY THIS PERSON HAS PROMOTED POINTS WORTH OF CARDS WE SHOULD REALLY GANG UP ON THEM IT ENCOURAGES YOU TO REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE GAME
SO YOU PLAYED THE GAME ONCE MISSED THE IMPORTANCE OF A CORE STRATEGY AND THINK THE GAME RULES NEED TO BE CHANGED

I'M GOING TO SAY THE RULES DON'T NEED TO BE CHANGED AND NOR DOES IT NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT YOU SEE WHAT CARD GOES TO THE INNER CIRCLE AS IT HAPPENS IF IT'S THE BASE CARDS THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF POINTS BANKED IF YOU SEE THEY CONSISTENTLY PROMOTE BOUGHT CARDS THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S A TERRITORY OR TWO'S WORTH IN THERE FOR EVERY BIG CARD

MOST PEOPLE WILL ONLY BE PROMOTING MAYBE A HALF DOZEN CARDS IN TOTAL UNLESS THEY GO ALL IN ON THE STRATEGY IN WHICH CASE YOU SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO PREVENT THEM GETTING THE PROMOTE CARDS FROM THE MARKETPLACE OR RUSHED TO THE END OF THE GAME WITH THE CONQUEST CARDS

GIVE IT A FEW MORE GAMES AS ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON THE BOARD SECTION IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING KEEPING TRACK OF WHAT OTHER PLAYERS ARE DOING
CARCASSONNE WILL BE AT MY THANKSGIVING TABLE AS IT IS EVERY YEAR TOSS THE PIECES IN A DRAW BAG DIVVY UP THE MEEDLESS DONE I KEEP MY MEEDLESS IN TINY SEPARATE ZIPLOCS FOR QUICKER DOLING OUT IT CAN TEND TO SPRAWL THOUGH SO I GUESS IT MISSES THAT POINT FOR YOU
PANDEMIC THE CURE DICE GAME ABOUT MINUTES TO PLAY SETUP IS LESS THAN MINS
I'M GEARING UP MY LINEUP FOR THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR AND WILL BRING THE FOLLOWING NOTE MY FAMILY IS NOT ALL THAT GEEKY OR INTO GAMES SO BEAR THAT IN MIND

CODENAMES
DR EUREKA
SAY ANYTHING
TELESTRATIONS
CASH N GUNS
SAFRANITO
THE RESISTANCE

VIA NEBULA IS SUPER FAST TO SETUP JUST PLAYER BOARDS AND TOKENS AND ONE SET OF TILES TO RANDOMIZE AVERAGE FOOTPRINT BUT EASY SETUP AND VERY LOW ENTRY POINT
I SUGGEST YOU POST SOME SCREENS AND EXPLANATIONS OF THE FUNCTIONALITY SINCE IT'S IPAD ONLY I'M UNABLE TO EVEN PREVIEW IT IN THE STORE SINCE I'M ON MY IPHONE
BRING YOUR OWN SNACKS AND DRINKS THERE IS A KROGER GROCERY STORE NOT FAR FROM THE CONVENTION CENTER WAY CHEAPER THAN VENDING MACHINES

PLAN FOR BREAKS BETWEEN EVENTS MAKE SURE TO GIVE YOURSELF AN HOUR OR MORE FOR LUNCH AND DINNER

GIVE YOURSELF AT LEAST HOURS TO WALK THROUGH THE VENDOR HALL MAYBE MORE IF YOU LIKE TO STOP AND TALK A LOT

VENDORS WILL HAVE COOL OFFERS AND DEALS BUT DON'T EXPECT TO SEE MASSIVE DISCOUNTS EVERYWHERE

THERE IS A FOOD COURT WITH TYPICAL STUFF ACROSS THE STREET IS A MAX AND WHICH HAS HIGHER QUALITY AMERICANA SOMETIMES GOOD FOR YOUR BELLY TO GO OVER THERE AND JUST HAVE A SOUP AND SALAD THERE IS A BUILDING CALLED THE NORTH MARKET THAT IS A HALF BLOCK AWAY FROM THE CONVENTION CENTER THAT HAS A LOT OF GOOD FOOD VENDORS

YOU WILL PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR MEDIOCRE FOOD FROM ANY OF THE STANDS IN AND JUST OUTSIDE OF THE VENDOR HALL

FOR EVENTS EARLY BECAUSE THE HOT ONES WILL SELL OUT YOU CAN BUY GENERIC TOKENS THAT WILL GET YOU IN TO ANY EVENT BUT ONLY IF THERE ARE AVAILABLE SEATS FREQUENTLY RAGS WILL RESERVE A SEAT OR TWO FOR GENERIC TOKENS BIG COMPANIES HAVE RESERVED AREAS AND ARE ALWAYS RUNNING EVENTS SO AS LONG AS YOU AREN'T PICKY YOU CAN SHOW UP WITH GENERICS AND GET A SEAT AT ANY KIND OF GAME

THE CONVENTION IS HOURS A DAY BUT PLEASE GET SLEEP AND SHOWER BEING TIRED AND CRANKY SUCKS BEING SMELLY IS RUDE

WHEN I FLY I PACK AN EXTRA BAG TO BRING HOME MY HAUL THERE ARE ALSO SHIPPING CENTERS WHERE YOU CAN BOX UP YOUR PURCHASES AND SHIP THEM IF YOU ARE DRIVING MAKE SURE TO LEAVE ROOM IN YOUR CAR
HERE IS A NICE REPOSITORY OF INFO THAT SOMEONE POSTED OVER AT BG
CAN WE SETUP A COLUMBUS BOARD GAMER NEETUP I'M LOCAL AND WILL BE THERE UNLESS SOMETHING PREVENTS ME I KNOW SOME GOOD SPOTS FOR DRINKS AND FOOD AND CAN DRIVE
IS A HIGH PLAYER COUNT AND A LOT OF THE GAMES ON YOUR LISTS DON'T GO THAT HIGH SO I'LL TOSS OUT A FEW SUGGESTIONS

VITICULTURE ESSENTIAL EDITION

EMPIRE LEGENDS

BEYOND BAKER STREET

DEAD OF WINTER

TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES

LEGACY THE TESTAMENT OF DUKE DE CRECY

THE RESISTANCE

ASCENSION

COVERT

TRAGEDY LOOPER

KINGSBURG

DIAMANT
ARE YOU ME I'M LOOKING FOR BASICALLY THE SAME THING SAME PRICE RANGE OWN LIKE A LOT OF THE SAME GAMES I'LL COME BACK TO THIS THREAD A BIT LATER
TERRAFORMING MARS A FEAST FOR ODIN AND GREAT WESTERN TRAIL ARE PROBABLY THE THREE BEST NEW GAMES FROM ESSEN
SECONDING THIRDINGS FOURTHING GREAT WESTERN TRAIL IT HAS A LOT OF ELEMENTS BUT THEY ALL WORK REALLY WELL TOGETHER AND IT'S SUCH A FUN GAME TO PLAY AT ANY PLAYER COUNT I ALSO LOVED FABLED FRUIT AND CRY HAVOC
PROBABLY NOT THE MOST POPULAR BUT I WAS PRETTY EXCITED FOR KYTHE TO COME OUT BEAUTIFUL KIDS GAME WITH A POP-UP BOARD CAN'T WAIT TO PICK IT UP AND TRY IT WITH MY LITTLE ONE
MARKHAM HORROR CG SEAWALL
I JUST RECEIVED GREAT WESTERN TRAIL AND AM EXCITED TO TRY IT THIS WEEKEND I TOO HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS

I'M EXPECTING COTTAGE GARDEN TO BE DELIVERED ON FRIDAY I'VE HEARD MIXED REVIEWS WHERE I THINK PEOPLE WERE HOPING IT WOULD HAVE THE ECONOMIC PIECE FROM PATCHWORK AS WELL BUT IT DOESN'T AFTER WATCHING THE RADIO RUN THROUGH IT LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT GAME TO PLAY WITH MY WIFE DURING DINNER

I'M STILL WAITING TO GET MY COPY OF A FEAST FOR ODIN AND HAVE HEARD A LOT OF POSITIVE RESPONSES
I WOULD BE BREASTFUL TO RECEIVE SUCH GENEROSITY I AM A GAMER WHO WORKS HARD TO TAKE CARE OF 2 KIDS AND WORKS FULL TIME DIAPERS AND FORMULA DON'T ALLOW ME TO BUY MANY NEW THINGS SO THIS WOULD BE A TREAT ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S ONE PLAYER
THANKS FOR DOING THIS THIS IS GREAT
I'M NOT A FAN OF THE GAME BUT THIS IS A LOVELY GESTURE

IT'S THINGS LIKE THIS AND THE GENERALLY CHILLED OUT ATMOSPHERE OF THIS SUBREDDIT THAT REALLY MAKE THIS A GOOD PLACE TO CHAT ABOUT BOARDGAMES
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE A FREE COPY I'LL LET OTHERS GET A CHANCE TO GET IT AWESOME OF YOU TO DO THIS THOUGH
THANKS PRETTY COOL TO DO THIS
AM NOT IN THE US SO CAN'T PARTAKE BUT WANTED TO SAY MADE ME SMILE SUCH A NICE GESTURE

HAPPY THANKSGIVING FOR TOMORROW TO YOU OP AND TO ALL THOSE HERE WHO CELEBRATE
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER HAPPY HOLIDAYS
OHH SHINY
THIS IS AWESOME AND YOU'RE AWESOME THANKS
WILL DO THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY
HEY I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS REAL COOL AS A STUDENT I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FLOWING SO MY GAMES ARE WELL PLAYED I DO HAVE PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO PLAY IN ABUNDANCE WHO EVER WINS THIS IS COOL OF YOU HAVE A GREAT TG
THIS IS A GREAT GESTURE THANKS FOR BRINGING PEOPLE SOME HAPPINESS
THANKS FOR DOING THIS SUCH A KIND GESTURE
THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU IF YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN THIS AWAY YET I REALLY APPRECIATE IT
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES AND I LOVE THE DC UNIVERSE BUT AFTER LOOKING AT THE CARD ART IN QUESTION I REALIZED I WASN'T SURE OF THE ORIGIN OF THE ART EITHER

USING REVERSE GOOGLE SEARCH IT'S APPARENT THAT THE LOCATION OF THE BATTLE WAS BLUDHAVEN BEST KNOWN AS THE CITY WHERE NIGHTING OPERATES OUT OF AFTER LEAVING BATMAN AND GOTHAM EVENTUALLY BLUDHAVEN IS THE SITE OF A MAJOR BATTLE IN INFINITE CRISIS THAT LEAVES THE CITY IN RUINS BUT THIS SPECIFIC PICTURE IS NOT FROM THAT BATTLE

SHORTLY AFTER INFINITE CRISIS FINAL CRISIS BEGINS AND DARKSEID TAKES CONTROL OF BLUDHAVEN AND USES IT AS A STRATEGIC STAGING BUNKER THIS ARTWORK IS A PANEL IN THE COMIC SHOWING WHAT BLUDHAVEN LOOKED LIKE AT THE TIME OF THIS OCCUPATION UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT CERTAIN WHY THERE ARE DALMATIANS BUT THE COMICS OF INTEREST ARE INFINITE CRISIS INFINITE CRISIS AFTERMATH THE BATTLE FOR BLUDHAVEN AND FINAL CRISIS SPECIFICALLY FINAL CRISIS CONTAINS THE PANEL FEATURING THIS ARTWORK

SORRY I COULDN'T BE MORE SPECIFIC BUT I RECOMMEND MAKING A NEW POST ON R DCCOMICS FOR MORE INFO IF YOU'RE CURIOUS AND REFERENCING THIS IMAGE
ARCADIA QUEST STRIKES ME AS SOMETHING THAT WILL GO STRAIGHT TO YOUR ALMOST NEVER PLAY SECTION

GALAXY TRUCKER SEEMS WELL SUITED FOR YOUR NEEDS BUT I HEAR THE GAME CAN BE DIVISIVE

LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS ON YOUR HEAVILY PLAYED LIST AND THE EXPANSION IS A PRETTY STRONG IMPROVEMENT ON THE GAME

LOVE LETTER IS IN MY OPINION A LACK LUSTER GAME I BOUGHT LOOT LETTER FOR RECENTLY AND I THINK THE GAME IS ONLY WORTH AROUND THAT MUCH EVEN THEN I LIVE IN SOCAL SO PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE WOULD RATHER PLAY TIEN LEN IF WE HAVE PEOPLE

GAMES THAT HAVE MADE THE BIGGEST SPLASH FOR MY CASUAL GROUP OF FRIENDS

BONANZA THIS GAME HAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TRADING INTERACTION IT GETS MENTIONED A LOT BUT I FEEL NOT NEARLY ENOUGH FOR HOW CONSISTENT A CROWD PLEASER IT IS

CODENAMES I CAN KIND OF SEE THIS GAME GETTING TIRING BUT THE FIRST COUPLE PLAYS ARE ALWAYS AMAZING AND CONSIDERING YOU CAN FIND IT AT FROM TIME TO TIME IT'S AN EASY ADDITION TO ANY COLLECTION

SAY ANYTHING THIS ONE REALLY DEPENDS ON YOUR FRIENDS THAT BEING SAID I'VE HAD LOTS OF SUCCESS AND I REGULARLY SEE IT FOR UNDER

RACE FOR THE GALAXY CHEAP AND QUICK THE GAME LENGTH WILL KEEP YOUR FRIENDS WILLING TO PLAY AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE VERY DIFFICULT LEARNING SESSIONS THE INHERENT DEPTH OF THE GAME WILL KEEP YOU AS A HOST INTERESTED

TICKET TO RIDE ITS REPUTATION IS DESERVED ALTHOUGH SPLENDOR IS NOT FAR REMOVED FROM IT

SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH IT I FEEL LIKE ITS A BIT TOO SIMPLE FOR ME BUT MY FRIENDS LOVE IT SO IT MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT FOR YOU
COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS FANTASTIC AND I DON'T SEE IT LISTED IN YOUR GAMES FOCUSES ON ALLIANCES NEGOTIATION BLUFFING AND EACH ALIEN RACE HAS A DISTINCT ABILITY THAT CHANGES THE WAY YOU APPROACH EACH MATCH DEFINITELY BEST FOR PLAYERS BUT WITH EXPANSIONS YOU CAN GET UP TO
LIGHT

I THINK LOVE LETTER CAN BE A LOT OF FUN FOR A FEW ROUNDS HERE AND THERE FOR THE PRICE I'D SAY THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON IT

I RECENTLY DISCOVERED GUILLOTINE AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT AGAIN ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE PRICE

MEDIUM

GIVEN THAT YOUR FRIENDS STARTED OUT WITH MONOPOLY YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT POWER GRID KIND OF A SIMILAR THEME BUT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY FUN JUST KIDDING MONOPOLY IS ACTUALLY STILL A GUILTY PLEASURE OF MINE

ADMITTEDLY I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO PLAY THIS ONE A LOT YET BUT I STILL FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE RECOMMENDING CASTLES OF BURGUNDY I THINK IT FALLS PRETTY NICELY IN BETWEEN LIGHT AND MEDIUM IN TERMS OF COMPLEXITY
I'M CURIOUS WHATS EVERYONE'S THOUGHTS ON LEGENDARY
AS I WAS PLAYING NO MAN'S SKY EARLIER THIS YEAR I BECAME OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF REPLICATING THIS KIND OF

SADIST

ALL HONESTY CONSIDERING HOW THAT ALL WENT DOWN MIGHT WANT TO USE A STUDENT COMPARISON MAYBE SPELUNK SINCE YA KNOW PEOPLE LIKED IT
IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA THOUGH A BOARD GAME VERSION OF NO MAN'S SKY ISN'T SOMETHING I'D CALL A SELLING POINT
HAVE HER WATCH A REVIEW AND ASK HERALDRY

ZEE GARCIA

DRIVE THROUGH REVIEW

TEAM COVENANT DEMO
IF SHE DISLIKES DICE GAMES BECAUSE OF THE RANDOMNESS IT MIGHT MAKE HER DISLIKE THE PULLING OF A TOKEN OUT OF THE BAG BECAUSE IT CAN SWING FROM A TO A ON NORMAL DIFFICULTY

OTHER THAN THAT I FELT IT WAS PRETTY IMMERSIVE AND FUN GAME PLAY
MARKHAM HAS A STRONG TEAMWORK FOCUS WHEN WE PLAY IT'S MORE FOCUSED AROUND WINNING MECHANICS THAN IT IS ABOUT THE STORY I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE IT WOULD BE A DECENT FIT
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN YOU COULD SAY THINGS LIKE AHH GRAB YOUR BASEBALL BAT AND GET IN HERE THERE'S A GHOUL AND I FAILED THE EVASION CHECK YOU HAVE TO SAVE ME OR NOW HOLD STILL I'M GONNA TRY TO SHOOT THAT FIEND BUT IF I MISS AND HIT YOU YOU'RE DEAD WELL DON'T MISS I'LL TRY NOT TO DO YOU HAVE ANY CARDS YOU CAN DITCH TO HELP OR I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN IN THE BASEMENT YOU GO FIRST ME BUT I'M ALMOST INSANE WHAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING SCARY DOWN THERE
MY F AND I HAVE PLAYED THE CAMPAIGN AND HAD A GREAT TIME WITH IT I SUGGEST PLAYING ON EASY MODE PERSONALLY SOME MAY SAY THIS ISN'T THE CORRECT WAY TO PLAY IT BUT I FOUND THE STANDARD DIFFICULTY TO BE A BIT MUCH AND IT KIND OF SOURED THE ENJOYMENT A BIT FOR US ANYWAYS IT'S AN AWESOME CO-OP EXPERIENCE AND DISCUSSION AND TEAMWORK ARE A MUST THE STORY IS GREAT AND THE DECK BUILDING IS FUN AND THE CHAOS BAG CONCEPT CHANGES IT UP AND WORKS WELL SHE WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BUT ENDED UP LIKING IT A LOT MORE THAN SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD IT'S WORTH IT GOOD LUCK WITH THE PERSUADING
MY PARTNER LOVES TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES BUT MARKHAM CG REALLY FLOPPED WITH HERALDRY THE STORY ELEMENTS WEREN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT CARD PLAY THAT SHE DIDN'T ENJOY
THIS IS MY MOST ANTICIPATED GAME OF NEXT YEAR ROBINSON CRUSOE IS GREAT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IGNACE HAS PUT IN THE EFFORT TO MAKE FIRST MARTIANS SOMETHING SPECIAL

REALLY EXCITED FOR THIS GAME RECENTLY READ AN EXCERPT FROM IGNACE ON THE FACEBOOK PAGE ABOUT THE PLAYTESTING OF FIRST MARTIANS THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING SO I'LL COPY IT

FIRST MARTIANS IS BEING DEVELOPED USING THE ROBINSON CRUSOE ENGINE BOTH GAMES USE THE SAME BASIC MECHANISM YOU SPEND ACTION PAWN AND YOU ROLL A DICE OR YOU SPEND BOTH OF YOUR ACTION PAWNS AND THAT S AN AUTO SUCCESS
FOR EXAMPLE YOU GO FOR THE EXPLORE ACTION YOU SPEND ACTION PAWN SO YOU GRAB GREEN DICE AND ROLL THEM MOST LIKELY YOU WILL SUCCEED WITH YOUR ACTION THERE ARE SUCCESS ICONS MOST LIKELY YOU WILL HAVE AN ADVENTURE ADVENTURE ICONS AND THERE S A CHANCE YOU LL BE WOUNDED WOUND ICONS
EVEN THOUGH ALL ADVENTURES IN THE DECK ARE BAD PLAYERS OFTEN WANT THESE ENCOUNTERS THEY ARE EAGER TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WILL THEY GET LOST IN THE WOODS FIND A CURSED HUT STUMBLE UPON A CORPSE OF A DEAD GOAT SO MANY COOL THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN
THEY ROLL THE DICE THEY HAVE ADVENTURES THE GAME IS RICH IN STORIES AND THEME ROBINSON CRUSOE AT ITS BEST
LET S VISIT MARS

THERE S BEEN AN INTERESTING ISSUE FOR ME TO DEAL WITH THE PLAYTESTERS DON T ROLL THE DICE THEY PERFORM ALL THEIR ACTIONS WITH 2 ACTION PAWNS AND THEY DO EVERYTHING LITERALLY EVERYTHING THEY CAN NOT TO ROLL THE DICE
THE LAST TEST I RAN THEY DIDN T PLANT THE SEEDS IN THE GREENHOUSE THE PLANTS DIDN T GROW OBVIOUSLY AND IN THE SECOND SCENARIO THE PLAYERS WILL MOST LIKELY DIE OF HUNGER BECAUSE FOOD RESERVES ARE REALLY LOW AND YET THEY MANAGED TO JUST ACHIEVE THE SCENARIO S OBJECTIVE THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM THEY NEEDED TO ACHIEVE TO FINISH THE GAME THEY DID NOTHING MORE NO PREPARATIONS WERE MADE FOR THE NEXT GAME

WHY DIDN T YOU PLANT THE SEEDS I ASKED AFTER THE TEST GAME

WE HAD NO TIME FOR THAT

YOU HAD THE TIME YOU KEPT USING 2 ACTION PAWNS FOR YOUR ACTIONS YOU COULD HAVE EASILY SPLIT THEM ROLL THE DICE AND DO THE PLANTING I POINTED OUT

I AM NOT ROLLING THESE FUCKING DICE I HEARD IN RESPONSE AND THAT S A QUOTE JUST IN CASE YOU WONDERED

YOU WILL DIE OF STARVATION IN THE CAMPAIGN S SECOND SCENARIO

THIS IS SPACE I AM NOT ROLLING THESE FUCKING DICE IN SPACE

THERE IS NO LOGIC IN THAT THIS IS NOTHING I COULD HAVE PREDICTED WHEN I WAS BUILDING THE GAME THERE IS NOTHING IN THE RULES THAT COULD BE CHANGED TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE THIS IS JUST A PURELY EMOTIONAL PROBLEM HAVING ADVENTURES ON THE CURSED ISLAND IS EXCITING AND COOL HAVING ADVENTURES ON MARS IS
I AM NOT ROLLING THESE FUCKING DICE
APP DRIVEN BUT ALL THE CARDS IN THE APP ARE THERE PHYSICALLY WHY IS EVERYTHING GOING APP DRIVEN
JUST REMEMBER THEY WILL PROBABLY SHIP IT ABOUT MONTHS LATE
I HATED ROBINSON CRUSOE BUT I'M WILLING TO TRY THIS HOPING THE THEME AND HOPEFULLY FAR BETTER WRITTEN RULES SPEAK TO ME MORE PLUS I LOVE IGNACE AS PERSON SO I FEEL COMPELLED TO TRY HARDER TO LIKE THIS GAME
CAN'T WAIT
YOU'RE A REAL FRIEND TO PUT THAT MUCH THOUGHT IN WHAT HE COULD ENJOY I'M SNIFFLING A BIT HERE
FRIEND SOUNDS LIKE THE MAJORITY KIDS AND ADULTS I MEET ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT USUALLY THEY ARE TOO AFRAID TO PLAY SOMETHING AS COMPLICATED AS TRURO MAYBE BOARD GAMES JUST AREN'T HIS THING HE HE EXPRESSED INTEREST AND ASKED TO PLAY A GAME ON HIS OWN
I DON'T KNOW THAT I'D RECOMMEND SPLENDOR AS EASY AS IT IS TO LEARN IT'S DIFFICULT TO PLAY AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DON'T THINK SEVERAL MOVES AHEAD WHILE YOU DO THE DISPARITY MAY REALLY STICK OUT THERE INSTEAD I'D RECOMMEND JAIPUR WHICH HAS A SIMILAR FEEL BUT SHAVES DOWN THE CHOICES A BIT BASICALLY THE DECISION TREE IS MUCH SMALLER ON ANY GIVEN TURN WITH JAIPUR

MIGHT ALSO CHECK OUT THE GRIZZLED FOR SOME CO-OP FUN
I WOULD RECOMMEND STAR REALMS AS AN EASY TO PICK UP DECKBUILDER THE RULES ARE SIMPLE AND THE INDIVIDUAL TURNS AREN'T TOO LONG OR COMPLEX I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE ABILITY TO GO COMPETITIVE OR CO-OP IT'S BEEN A RELATIVELY EASY GAME TO SHARE WITH THOSE UNFAMILIAR REGARDLESS OF THEIR GAMING EXPERIENCE
CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG IS SUPER EASY TO LEARN BUT OFFERS A LOT OF GAME PLAY FOR A EURO SPARTIUM IS ANOTHER EASY TO LEARN EURO THAT OFFERS SOME FUN GAME PLAY BOTH OF THEM ARE FAIRLY INEXPENSIVE BOTH ARE RARE AUCTION GAMES THAT WORK WELL WITH 2 PLAYERS AND BOTH OFFER MORE GAME PLAY THAN THE RULES WOULD LEAD YOU TO EXPECT
HE DOESN'T TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN THE RULES

I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE BUT IS THIS BECAUSE OF HIS DISABILITY OR BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL PREFERENCE YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THE LATTER

IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN MY RESPONSE IS THE FOLLOWING WHEN I PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO PAY ATTENTION TO RULES IT IS A SUPREME BUMMER AND THEY USUALLY DON'T GET INVITED BACK IT'S ESPECIALLY BAD IF WE'RE PLAYING IN A LARGER GROUP BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE'S TIME IS BEING WASTED AND DRAGGED OUT BY SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO CO-OPERATE IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO LEARN THE RULES OF A GAME HE'S NOT READY TO PLAY THE GAME ASK IF HE WOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY A GAME WITHOUT SMOKING POT AND SEE IF THAT HELPS ANYTHING

IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE THEN IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TRYING OUT ABSTRACTS AND FILLER GAMES AND THEN MOVING UP FROM THERE BATTLE LINE JAIPUR AND MR JACK POCKET ARE SOME GOOD 2 PLAYER GAMES WITH FEW RULES AND ENOUGH RANDOMNESS THAT THE MORE SKILLED PLAYER DOESN'T HAVE A COMPLETE ADVANTAGE
I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THE FEW TIMES I'VE PLAYED FIVE TRIBES I'VE ONLY EVER PLAYED IT WITH MY SON AND NEPHEW WHO AREN'T THE MOST STRATEGIC THINKERS AND IT WASN'T A COMPLETE BLOWOUT EACH TIME THE MECHANICS ARE VERY EASY TO GRASP AND EACH PLAYER GETS A QUICK REFERENCE SHEET AS WELL
I HAVE A COUPLE GENERAL SUGGESTIONS

WHEN ONE PLAYER IS A LOT BETTER THAN THE OTHER IN TERMS OF STRATEGY HIGH LUCK GAMES HELP TOO IT EVENS OUT THE WINS LOSSES AND IT MAKES THINGS A BIT MORE INTERESTING FOR THE BETTER PLAYER TOO BECAUSE YOU'RE STRUGGLING AGAINST LUCK AND THE GAME AS YOU PLAY NOT JUST AGAINST THE OTHER PLAYER EXAMPLES OF THIS ARE CARD GAMES LIKE JAIPUR AND LOST CITIES

2 HE MIGHT HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH EUROS BECAUSE THEY TRY TO HAVE STREAMLINED RULE SETS AS OPPOSED TO MORE AMERITRASHY GAMES WITH LOTS OF RULE EXCEPTIONS SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN PURCHASING NEW GAME READ THE RULES IF THERE ARE LOTS OF LITTLE EXCEPTIONS GIVE IT A PASS

IF YOU GUYS CAN HANDLE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY I THINK WONDERS DUEL SHOULD WORK IT PLAYS IN MINS TO AN HOUR AND THE TURNS ALL REVOLVE AROUND DOING THE SAME THING DRAFTING A CARD FROM THE CARD PYRAMID
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TOO LIGHT BUT I'VE REALLY ENJOYED QUADROPOLIS WHICH WAS RELEASED THIS YEAR IS SOMETHING I WOULD RECOMMEND THE RULES ARE FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT THE DECISIONS ARE VERY DIFFICULT BUT IF YOU WANT TO JUST PLAY IT AS A QUICK FUN NO THOUGHT HERE STYLE OF GAME YOU CAN I'VE PLAYED IT WITH PEOPLE WHO PREFER HEAVIER EUROS AND LIGHTER AMERITRASH GAMES AND I LENT IT TO SOMEONE WHO PLAYED IT WITH HIS SONS AND AND EVERYONE HAS ENJOYED IT
HERE IS THE FULL BREAK DOWN OF THE EPISODE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS THINK OF OUR PODCAST

HOST TIM JENNETTE METAL STEEPLE AND MATT REBEAR START THE EPISODE WITH A FEW BOARD GAME FIRST IMPRESSIONS FOR MENNONITE MANNERS LOST CITIES THE VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO AND THE GAME OF NEXT THEY DISCUSS PROPER SPOILER ETIQUETTE TOYS INDUCTED INTO THE TOY HALL OF FAME THE FIRST BOARD GAMING TABLE EVER THE PLANTABLE AND FINISH OFF THE EPISODE WITH THEIR TOP FAVORITE CEREALS
HEY I'M IN THE USA AT I RECENTLY COMPILED A RATHER LONG LIST OF GAMES I WANT AND FOUND THE BEST PRICE FROM EITHER AMAZON OR SELLERS ON BG I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME NARROW IT DOWN TO A SINGLE GAME TO ASK ABOUT DEALS ON SO INSTEAD I'LL ASK FURTHER ABOUT WHERE YOU LOOK FOR DEALS WILL CHECK OUT THE SITE YOU ALREADY LINKED NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC PRICE RANGE MORE FOR GREAT DEALS FOR THE GAMES ON MY LIST TO MAKE ACQUIRING ALL THE ITEMS ON IT MORE FEASIBLE ON A SHORTER TIMESCALE
I'M LOOKING FOR SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL DEATHLING SPACE MARINE PACK MY ZINCODE IS I'D LOVE TO PAY AT OR UNDER THE MARK SHIPPED

NOTE THIS MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT WE ALL HAVE OUR DREAMS
ATB SAFE RETURN DOUBTFUL
THIS IS PROBABLY MORE APPROPRIATE FOR R BOARDGAMEDEALS
AND WILL BE ABLE TO PLAY WONDERS BUT NOT NECESSARILY TEACH THEMSELVES IT THAT SAID IT'S MORE COMPLEX AT 2 I'D SUGGEST GETTING THEM WONDERS DUEL THOUGH

MERCHANT OF VENUS AT LEAST THE CLASSIC RULES ARE FINE AT AGAIN TEACH THEM TO PLAY THEY'LL BE FINE

AROUND OR SO KIDS HAVE ALL THE MENTAL ACUITY TO DEVELOP STRATEGY AND ARE ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT BETTER AT ABSORBING RULES THAN ADULTS BUT EMOTIONAL MATURITY CAN SOMETIMES BE LACKING SO AVOID GAMES WITH HUGE GOTCHAS OR VOTE TO WIN GAMES LIKE CITY OF HORROR LIFEBOATS THIS IS MAGNIFIED IN A SIBLING ESPECIALLY SITUATION

IF YOU GO CHECK OUT LIKE US AND THEIR ACCESSIBILITY TEARDOWN LOOK AT THE COGNITIVE SECTIONS ABOUT EMOTIONAL ACCESSIBILITY

LASTLY KIDS GENERALLY PREFER OWNING THINGS OVER SHARING THINGS GIVE THEM 2 GAMES ONE TO ONE AND ONE TO THE OTHER
I DON'T THINK GAMES SHOULD HAVE AN EXPLICITLY EDUCATIONAL ELEMENT TO THEM ESPECIALLY NOT FOR PLAYERS AT THAT AGE PLAYING ANY GAME BUT THE MOST SIMPLISTIC LIFE CHUTES AND LADDERS REQUIRES INTELLECTUAL EFFORT AND WILL IMPROVE THEIR LOGICAL REASONING AND DECISION MAKING SKILLS

AT AGE THEY CAN BASICALLY PLAY ANYTHING GO WITH A GOOD GATEWAY GAME WONDERS WILL WORK BUT TICKET TO RIDE PANDEMIC DOMINION ARE ALL GREAT CHOICES
TIMELINE IT'S A TRIVIA SERIES IT MIGHT BE A BIT DENSE BUT IT'S SUPER EASY TO PLAY

WITS AND WAGERS AN EASIER TRIVIA GAME THAT HAS REDEMPTION BUT YOU'LL BE LEARNING LESS IN THAT GAME THAN IN TIMELINE
WHY DO YOU THINK WONDERS WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR THEM THE SUGGESTED AGE RANGE IS YEARS OLD IS ABOUT MIDDLE SCHOOL ONLY THE SUPER COMPLEX GAMES SHOULD BE TOO MUCH TO HANDLE IF EVEN THAT WHAT KIND OF THEMES DO THEY LIKE
CARCASSONNE IS GREAT FOR THIS AGE AND ABOVE NOT BUT LOTS OF STRATEGY INVOLVED AND LOTS OF CHEAP EXPANSIONS AVAILABLE IF YOU WANT TO ADD ON CODENAMES DIXIT AND MYSTERIUM HAVE GOOD DEDUCTION AND CREATIVITY ELEMENTS
PANDEMIC IS AT LEAST VAGUELY REALISTIC AND IS A GOOD INTRO TO COOP GAMES OR FORBIDDEN ISLAND DESERT
AND IS OLD ENOUGH TO PLAY LITERALLY ANYTHING SO GO WITH EITHER BOTH

A THEME THEY REALLY CONNECT WITH

AN EXPERIENCE YOU'VE SEEN THEY CONNECT WITH WHEN GAMING
WHILE I DON'T LIKE WONDERS IT'S LISTED AS YOU COULD PROBABLY BUY IT FOR THEM WITHOUT WORRIES IF YOU ALSO TEACH IT TO THEM

ALTERNATIVELY TIMELINE MAKES FOR A NICE ADD ON YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT TOPIC YOU THINK WOULD BE INTERESTING IT'S A FUN GAME THOUGH LIGHT LUCKILY IT'S FAIRLY INEXPENSIVE ALSO

YOU COULD GET THEM SUSHI GO AS AN INTRO TO DRAFTING GAMES

THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXCELLENT GAMES FOR THAT AGE RANGE AND BELOW I'M CONFUSED IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT STRIVES TO BE EDUCATIONAL OR FUN FIRST AND EDUCATIONAL IF POSSIBLE THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE MOST GAMES ARE EDUCATIONAL IN SOME MANNER BUT STUDIES SHOW THAT THE ACT OF PLAY IS THE MOST BENEFICIAL ASPECT OF GAMES AT YOUNG AGES I'D GO FOR GOOD FUN FIRST WITH A THEME YOU THINK WILL HOOK THEM WHAT ARE THEY INTERESTED IN
WAR GAMES ARE GREAT FOR TEACHING HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY AND NOT NEARLY AS AGGRESSIVE AS YOU MIGHT THINK

DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAIN GAMES FROM THE LIGHTER FAIR TO THE HEAVIER ARE GREAT TO TEACH GEOGRAPHY MATH AND ECONOMICS
CATAN PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD BUT YOU GET TO FLEX YOUR BRAIN A BIT WITH STRATEGY AND MAKING DEALS
SOMETHING LIKE WONDERS YET NOT AS COMPLICATED YOU SAY SOUNDS LIKE SUSHI GO TO ME
I'D SAY TICKET TO RIDE WOULD STAND OUT AS A CLEAR CHOICE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SIMPLE AND ELEGANT GATEWAYS TO LEARN AND PLAY PLUS SOME NICELY SUBTLE EDUCATIONAL BITS IN LEARNING THE GEOGRAPHY AND WORKING THE MATHEMATICS IT'S QUITE FAMILY FRIENDLY RARELY NASTY AND MORE FUNNY THAN MEAN WHEN SOMEONE DOES DROP A BLOCK I THINK YOU COULDN'T GO WRONG WITH TR
GAME OF THE STATES
WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE EVOLUTION IT HAS SOME BASIC BIOLOGY CONCEPTS IN IT PLUS THE ART'S GREAT MIGHT BE UP THEIR ALLEY IF THEY LIKE ANIMALS

IN A SIMILAR VEIN I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET BUT I'VE ORDERED A CARD GAME CALLED BIRDS OF A FEATHER IT'S ABOUT BIRDING AND USES LOTS OF REAL BIRD SPECIES BUT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TERRIBLY COMPLEX
LOOK INTO GENIUS GAMES THEY HAVE GAMES THAT TEACH CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY IN A FUN WAY THERE IS USUALLY A KICKSTARTER RUNNING BUT AMAZON CARRIES SOME ION COVALENCE PEPTIDE ARE THE NAMES I REMEMBER
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH MY KID IS AND WE PLAY WONDERS DUEL CASTLES OF BURGUNDY CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG TAKENOKO ZOOLORETTO PATCHWORK EIGHT MINUTE EMPIRE FORBIDDEN DESERT CV CODENAMES AND PAPERBACK WITH NO ISSUES I PROBABLY MISSED A FEW BUT YEAH AGE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO GAMING WHAT YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT IS WHAT KIND OF MECHANICS THEY LIKE I'D RECOMMEND GRABBING A FEW OF THE GAMES THERE'S MORE OUT THERE THAN YOU MIGHT THINK AND SEE WHAT STICKS
THE REASON I WOULD RANK THESE LIKE I DID IS THAT LEVEL HAS DIRECTIONAL LINE OF SIGHT AND THERE MORE COMPONENTS YOU HAVE TO MANAGE MORE TOKEN AND UPKEEP MORE THINGS AS THE OVERSEER

YOU COULD SWAP IMPERIAL ASSAULT AND DESCENT AROUND WITH FIENDLINESS BASED ON WHAT YOU CONSIDER FIDDLY IA HAS A BIT MORE FIENDLINESS WITH MANAGING THE DECK OF AGENDAS AND MISSIONS THE REBELS AND EMPIRE SWAP TAKING TURNS WHEREAS IN DESCENT THE CAMPAIGN IS LAID OUT AND IN A MORE LINEAR PATH WITH BRANCHES YOU CHOOSE AND THE HEROES ALL TAKE THEIR TURN THEN THE OVERLORD THE HEROES IN DESCENT ALSO GET TO CHOOSE A CLASS DECK AND NOT A SPECIFIC ROLE LIKE IN IMPERIAL ASSAULT

SO THATS WHY I RANKED THEM AS FOLLOWS

LEVEL OMEGA PROTOCOL

2 IMPERIAL ASSAULT

DESCENT
DESCENT CO-OP WITH THE APP WAS LEAST FIDDLY FOR US IMPERIAL ASSAULT WITH THE VS MANY AND MANAGING YOUR WHOLE CAMPAIGN ADDED COMPLEXITY THE LINE OF SIGHT FOR IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS ALSO MORE INVOLVED THAN DESCENT

WHILE LEVEL HAS AN INTERESTING SYSTEM FOR THE OVERSEER WE WERE CONSTANTLY LOOKING THROUGH THE RULE BOOK FOR ANSWERS THE RULE BOOK ISN'T THAT GREAT LINE OF SIGHT AND RANGE TOOK SOME GETTING USED TO BUT WASN'T TOO BAD LOTS OF POSTS ON THE INTERNET ABOUT IT

I HEAR THE NEW CONAN GAME IS QUITE SMOOTH A GOOD SYSTEM FOR BALANCING BOTH SIDES AND NOTHING TOO COMPLEX WHEN IT COMES TO USING ITEMS OR ABILITIES CHECK IT OUT
HAVEN'T PLAYED LEVEL BUT THE OTHER TWO AREN'T ESPECIALLY FIDDLY YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT DESCENT OVER IMPERIAL ASSAULT FOR FULL COOP PLAY

I ALSO SUGGEST LOOKING AT ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE SIMILAR FEEL AND PROBABLY ONE STEP LOWER ON THE FIDDLY SCALE
DUNGEON IS PRETTY LIGHT BUT IN THE SAME VEIN IT'S BEEN REDESIGNED RECENTLY WITH MORE MODERN CARTOON ARTWORK THAT WILL PROBABLY APPEAL TO THE KIDS BG LINK
MICE AND MYSTICS WORKS PERFECTLY FOR YEAR OLD KIDS I THINK IT'S TOO SIMPLE FOR ADULTS AND LACKS ANY IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND DEPTH BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT FOR KIDS
WAIT LIGHTER AND EASIER THAN HEROQUEST THAT'S ONE OF THE LIGHTEST AND EASIEST THERE IS
A FEW OPTIONS THAT AREN'T REALLY CLOSE IN GAME PLAY BUT MIGHT WORK ANYWAY WELCOME TO THE DUNGEON CASTLE PANIC AND ESCAPE

I AGREE WITH OTHER POSTERS ABOUT MICE AND MYSTICS ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WILL PREPARE THEM FOR DESCENT WHEN THEY ARE OLDER
TALISMAN
BOTH MY KIDS NEARLY AND LOVE PLAYING HEROSCAPE I BOUGHT A BOX OF OLD STUFF OFF EBAY THE BASIC RULES ARE PERFECT FOR THE YEAR OLD AND THE YEAR OLD LOVES HELPING PUT THE TERRAIN TOGETHER THEY MAKE AN ENORMOUS MAP AND WE ROAM AROUND IT WITH NINJAS DINOSAURS AND WORLD WAR 2 SOLDIERS IT'S BONKERS BUT SUPER FUN
I'D SUGGEST MACHS VS MINIONS

THE GAME IS EASY TO LEARN AND FUN THE OLDER ONE WILL HAVE A BLAST PLAYING IT THE YOUNGER ONE MIGHT NEED HELP AT FIRST ESPECIALLY READING CARDS AND ON PROGRAMMING BUT THAT WON'T BE AN ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE COOPERATIVE NATURE OF THE GAME
CONAN IS MY HEROQUEST REPLACEMENT I PLAYED A TON OF HEROQUEST IN THE SOUTH I'VE NEVER FOUND A GAME THAT FIT THAT SAME NICHE UNTIL I GOT CONAN IT'S OPEN SIMPLE THEMATIC AND TONS OF FUN I'VE READ A LOT OF COMMENTS FROM PEOPLE ON BG WHO HAVE HAD GREAT RESULTS WITH KIDS IN THE YEAR OLD RANGE

HOWEVER THE ARTWORK IS CERTAINLY MORE ADULT ORIENTED FOR EUROPEANS LIKE MY FAMILY THIS IS A IF YOU'RE AMERICAN YOUR FAMILY MAY NOT CARE FOR THE
THUNDER ALLEY

LONGHORN

IMPERIAL SETTLERS

STEAM ROLLERS

LAS VEGAS

ONITAMA

AMONG THE STARS

JUNK ART

ARCADIA QUEST

CASTELLATION

THE EXPLANATION OF LONGHORN WAS KIND OF AMAZING I'VE NEVER HAD SOMEONE PAINT A PICTURE OF THE MECHANICS AND GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE OF A GAME SO THOROUGHLY USING JUST WORDS MANY OTHER THOUGHTFUL DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE OTHER GAMES TOO

GREAT VIDEO OVERALL LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE
I LOVE THAT LIST IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS OFTENTIMES YOU GET A FEELING THAT EVERYONE IS TAKING SUGGESTIONS FROM THE SAME POOL OF GAMES I LOVE THAT SHE SEEKS OUT GAMES LIKE STEAM ROLLERS AND SHEDS MORE LIGHT ON THEM
I'M REALLY ENJOYING THIS LIST IT IS PRETTY REFRESHING TO SEE A LIST THAT VARIES THIS MUCH FROM THE NORM AND I LIKE PRESENTATION STYLE AND PERSONALITY A LOT
I LIKE THAT HER CHOICES ARE QUITE UNIQUE AND WELL EXPLAINED WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS THAT SHE TRIES TO FUNNY WAY TOO MUCH
I DON'T MIND THE SCRIPTED HUMOR IT WAS KEPT TO A MINIMUM AND THE VIDEOS FLOWED WELL BETWEEN GAMES I REALLY ENJOY THIS LIST IT'S DIFFERENT AND WELL THOUGHT OUT
HMM SEEING SOME OF THE COMMENTS ON THIS THREAD I WENT IN NOT EXPECTING TO LIKE THIS BUT I FOUND HER WELL-SPOKEN AND CLEAR SCRIPTING WORKS FOR HER AND I PREFER THAT PERSONALLY TO SOME OF THE USELESS BANTER TOM AND THE OTHERS HAVE IN THEIR VIDEOS LIKED THAT SHE HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS THAN THE OTHER DT FOLKS

HER HUMOR WAS A LITTLE CRINGE AT POINTS BUT IT WAS MINIMAL AND NOWHERE NEAR THE CRINGE OF CHAZ MARLER HIS PERSONALITY REALLY TURNS ME OFFICIAL OVERALL NEAT VIDEO WILL PROBABLY WATCH MORE BY HER IN THE FUTURE
YOU KNOW I'M NOT CRAZY FOR THE DICE TOWER BUT I GOTTA GIVE IT TO ZEE SAM TOM THAT THEY DON'T ADD BAD THEATRICS
WOW THAT WAS SO HARD I HOPE I CAN KEEP THIS UP WE'RE NOT WE KNOW THIS PRERECORDED SCRIPTED JOKES AREN'T YOUR OR THING JUST EXPLAIN WHY YOU LIKE THINGS AND GIVE MORE REASONS THAN I DIDN'T PLAY IT AS MUCH
SUZANNE IS HANDS DOWN THE MOST ENJOYABLE PERSONALITY ON TNT DOESN'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE OVERWHELMING GROUP THINK THAT SURROUNDS THE HOBBY AND OFFERS FAIR AND WELL CONSIDERED OPINIONS OF HER OWN SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT GREASY SALESMAN VIBE THAT TNT IS GETTING REALLY BAD FOR
IMPERIAL SETTLERS ON THE LIST ALWAYS LOOKS INTRIGUING TO ME BUT WHEN I READ REVIEWS ON IT IT SEEMS LIKE RAZING OUT BUILDINGS FROM OTHER PLAYERS IS A KEY PART OF THE GAME I DON'T MIND COMPETITIVE OR CUTTHROAT GAMES IN GENERAL BUT HAVING AN ENGINE BUILDING GAME WITH THAT NASTY OF A MECHANIC SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARSH TO PLAY WHAT DO FOLKS WHO OWN IT THINK
DELETED
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I FIND HER GRATING AND OBNOXIOUS I HAD TO TURN IT OFFICIAL SHE'S TRYING TOO HARD FOR THE I'M SO AWKWARD ISN'T THAT FUNNY
WELL SHE DEFINITELY HAS MORE OF A SCRIPTED STYLE BUT I ENJOYED HER VIDEO BECAUSE SHE MANAGED TO STAY FOCUSED AND TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT GAMES THAN THE REGULAR DT CREW WHO I ALWAYS ENJOY WATCHING

ON A SIDE NOTE TOP LISTS OR LESS MAKE MORE SENSE WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO RANK VS IT BECOMES A LOT LESS ABOUT WHICH IS REALLY YOUR FAVORITE GAME BUT HOW YOU FEEL AT THIS PRECISE MOMENT MOMENT NOT EVEN YEAR OR MONTH THIS ALSO EXPLAINS THE INSANE VOLATILITY WE SEE IN THESE TOP LISTS THE TOP USUALLY STAY THE SAME AND AS YOU GO UP IN NUMBERS IT BECOMES MEANINGLESS

I PLAY WITH AN ACTUAL SOMMELIER HE'S NOT SNOOTY AT ALL

I HAVEN'T GOT A HUGE COLLECTION BUT WOULD LOVE TAILORED SUGGESTIONS

WHERE IS YOUR COLLECTION AND YOUR RATING OF EACH GAME IN IT YOU HAVE PLAYED

GO MAYBE DOESN'T COUNT BUT I LOVE GO VERY HARD TO GET OTHERS INTO IT THOUGH BEYOND A BASIC GAME

CATAN FIRST LOVE OFTEN FIRST GAME ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON STRATEGIC DEPTH A LITTLE SALT ENOUGH THEME TO BE ENGAGING FUN FOR NEWIES

CARCASSONNE LESS TEACHING TIME SETUP WHICH IS BETTER FOR NEWIES BUT LESS DEPTH

GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME 2ND EDITION LESS BALANCED THAN OTHER GAMES BUT NICE DEPTH LAST TURN SCRAMBLE ALWAYS SEEMS VERY MECHANICAL AND OUT OF PLACE THOUGH

BETRAYAL AT THE HOUSE ON THE HILL FUN GAME LOTS OF REPLACEABILITY LOTS OF THEME SOME PLAYERS HATE BEING ALONE AS THE TRAITOR THOUGH HAUNT RULES ARE OFTEN AMBIGUOUS WHICH IS A BIG NEGATIVE FOR MORE GROUP

ZOMBIES I NEEDED SOMETHING TO WHIP OUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE DRINKING CHATTING NOT PAYING ATTENTION BUT STILL WANNA PLAY BOARDGAMES EASY TO TEACH BUT VERY LITTLE DEPTH LOOKS GREAT AND MOWING THROUGH ZOMBIES OR SCREWING EACH OTHER OVER CAN BE FUN IN SMALL DOZES

LOVE LETTERS GRAND LITTLE GAME FUN TO PLAY A FEW ROUNDS BUT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THAT MUCH DEPTH USUALLY PLAYED AS WE WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO ARRIVE

COUP ENJOYABLE BLUFFING ELEMENT IS NICE BUT SOME GROUPS HATE IT MAKES FOR A GOOD INTERIM GAME

EXPLODING KITTENS QUITE A SHALLOW GAME BUT BIT OF A RUSSIAN ROULETTE TYPE TENSION CAN BE GOOD

PANDEMIC HAVE HAD SOME ENJOYABLE GAMES AND CAN SEE WHY SOME FOLKS WOULD REALLY LIKE IT BUT IT SEEMS TO DRAG ON TOO LONG WITH LOTS OF ELEMENTS THAT DON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH DEPTH LOTS OF LUCK THE COLLABORATIVE THING FALLS FLAT WITH SOME GROUPS

BACK TO THE FUTURE ADVENTURE THROUGH TIME MORE TRANSPARENT OF AN OPTIMIZATION PUZZLE THAN MOST GAMES MORE COMPLEX THAN DEEP ON THE SURFACE BUT WE LOVED THE THEME AND ART AND ACTUALLY QUITE ENJOYED IT IN THE END DOESN'T GET MUCH PLAY TIME THOUGH

FLUXXX EASY TO EXPLAIN AND PLAY WITH VARYING SIZES OF GROUPS CAN SOMETIMES GO ON FOREVER OR END IN AN OH ITS OVER THEN SORT OF WAY CONSTANTLY CHANGING GOALS MAKES IT FEEL LIKE EACH INDIVIDUAL TURN IS A GAME IN ITSELF WITH NO CHANCE OF OVERARCHING STRATEGY

TRURO A VERY NICE GAME LIKE THE APPARANCE NOVELTY AND SIMPLICITY ENJOYABLE FOR A ONCE IN A WHILE GAME GOOD LENGTH AND COMPLEXITY FEELS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF LUCK IN IT

CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY GREAT PARTY GAME VERY FLEXIBLE PLAYER NUMBERS DON'T EVEN NEED A TABLE LOTS OF LAUGHS LIMITED

ARTICULATE AGAIN PARTY GAME VERY ACCESSIBLE AND FAST PACED MAKES FOR GOOD LAUGHS SOME FOLKS HATE THE PACING

2 WHEN YOU PLAY THESE GAMES HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE PRESENT AT YOUR OCCASION

HEY I'LL TRY YOU OUT MISTER CONNOISSEUR

2

GAMES BELOW A IN THE LIST GIVEN IN QUESTION DON'T SEE MUCH PLAY BUT ALL HAVE BEEN PLAYED AT LEAST ONCE


A WHOLE EVENING SO ABOUT HOURS WE USUALLY PLAY MORE THAN ONE GAME


A GAMES GONE UNPLAYED FOR YEARS


IT'S FOR ME





CONSTANTINOPLE


A TROOP REPRESENT A GROUP OF SOLDIERS


BECAUSE IT WAS UNDER ENGLISH RULE FOR A TIME


ANALYSIS PARALYSIS


YOU TELL THEM AND ASK THEM TO STOP USUALLY CANDIDLY FOLLOWED IN MY GROUP BY IF YOU WIN YOU LOSE
COULD BE INTERESTING

WHERE IS YOUR COLLECTION AND YOUR RATING OF EACH GAME IN IT YOU HAVE PLAYED THESE AREN'T ALL TIME JUST RIGHT NOW IS FINE
I'M BEHIND ON MY RATINGS BUT HERE ARE MY RATED GAMES AND MY PLAYED BUT UNRATED
2 WHEN YOU PLAY THESE GAMES HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE PRESENT AT YOUR OCCASION
FROM TO NORMALLY WE'RE PRETTY GOOD ABOUT SPLITTING INTO TWO GROUPS WHEN NEEDED
WHAT GAMES ARE UNPLAYED IN THE COLLECTION
SHAME LIST
HOW LONG DO YOU TYPICALLY HAVE TO SETUP PLAY THEN TEARDOWN A GAME
ANYTHING OVER HOURS REQUIRES A SPECIALLY SCHEDULED GAME DAY
WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING IS PAINFUL TO YOU TO HAVE BOUGHT NOT JUST BUDGET SPENDING DEMEANOR
A GAMES GONE UNPLAYED FOR YEARS MILD DISCOMFORT
B ONE GAME YOU PLAY ALL THE TIME NO DISCOMFORT
C GAMES MY FRIENDS HATE FOR TOO AGGRESSIVE MODERATE DISCOMFORT
D GAMES WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND WELL ENOUGH TO GET TO THE TABLE HAS NOT OCCURRED
E USED ITEMS FROM HOBBIES YOU TRIED BUT DIDN'T STICK WITH NO DISCOMFORT
IS THIS QUESTION FOR YOU THEREFORE QUESTIONS CAN BE EASILY ANSWERED OR FOR ANOTHER
ME
WHAT IS THE CUBE ROOT OF

WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE IMPREGNABLE CITY THAT ROME MOVED ITS CAPITOL TO THAT DIDN'T FALL UNTIL CANNONS WERE USED AGAINST IT
CONSTANTINOPLE
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TROOP AND A SOLDIER
SOLDIER IS SINGULAR TROOP IS COLLECTIVE
WHY DO PEOPLE IN INDIA SPEAK ENGLISH
BRITISH EAST INDIA COMPANY
WHAT DOES AP MEAN
USUALLY ANALYSIS PARALYSIS OCCASIONALLY ACTION POINTS
HOW DO YOU GET SOMEONE WHO'S PROBABLY UNINTENTIONALLY CHEATING TO STOP DOING THE BEHAVIOR THAT'S GIVING THEM THE ADVANTAGE
POINT OUT THE RULES MISTAKE IF THEY CONTINUE IT'S NOT UNINTENTIONAL

ALRIGHT



2 NEARLY ALWAYS SOMETIMES 2

JUST THE COLONISTS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T YET HAD A SPARE HOURS TO PLAY IT

HOURS

I LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS QUESTION IS ASKING

FOR ME

AND TWO IMAGINARY CUBE ROOTS OF AND BUT I'M GUESSING YOU MEANT

NOT GOT A SCOOBY DO

I GUESS THAT A TROOP IS A MULTIPLE OF SOLDIERS

CAUSE WE COLONISED THE SHIT OUT OF THEM NICKED ALL THEIR TEA AND GAVE THEM THE GREATEST SPORT IN THE WORLD

ALAN PARTRIDGE AHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA YOU KIND OF REMIND ME OF HIM

I WOULDN'T PLAY WITH CHEATERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
INTERESTING IDEA I HAVEN'T PLAYED WITH THE BOARD TILES OUTSIDE OF PLAYING THE GAME

I'M CURIOUS IF YOU ALL HAVE HOUSE RULES ABOUT TILE PLACEMENT WHEN MY FRIENDS AND I PLAY OUR RULE IS THAT THE DRAWN TILE MUST BE PLACED IN A WAY THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE SO THE ROOM TILE THAT IS DRAWN HAS TWO DOORS THE DOORS MUST BE CONNECTED TO OTHER ROOMS WITH OPEN DOORS IF POSSIBLE YOU CANNOT JUST DECIDE TO AIM THE SECOND DOOR IN A NEW DIRECTION TO OPEN A PATH AWAY FROM DISCOVERED ROOMS

ANYONE ELSE HAVE RULES LIKE THAT OR SIMILAR RULES IN OTHER GAMES PERHAPS
THIS REMINDS ME OF HOW NICE IT CAN FEEL SOMETIMES TO DOODLE WITH CARCASSONNE TILES
I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT ABOUT THIS I HAVE COME ACROSS PERFECT FLOORS BEFORE BUT NOT AN ENTIRE HOUSE ESPECIALLY SINCE A LOT OF TILES CAN BE ADDED TO MULTIPLE FLOORS IT'D BE AN INTERESTING IDEA TO PLAY IF YOU DIDN'T EXPLORE BUT SIMPLY HAD A PERFECT HOUSE AND DREW A CARD EACH TURN AT RANDOM USING A DICE ROLL ROLLING A FOR AN EVENT 2 FOR AN ITEM AND A FOR AN OMEN ON THE BETRAYAL DICE
THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME ON THE FIRST TURN OF MY FIRST GAME YOU HIT A LUCKY BREAK AND THE MONSTER IS SIMPLY DISCARDED IT'S IN THE RULES REFERENCE SOMEWHERE THOUGH I DON'T HAVE MINE HANDY RIGHT NOW SO I CAN'T POINT TO THE SPECIFIC DIRECTION

MINOR SPOILERS

FOR THOSE SAYING THIS CAN'T HAPPEN OR OP SET SOMETHING UP WRONG THAT'S NOT CORRECT THIS CAN COME UP IN THE GATHERING WHILE THE INVESTIGATORS ARE HOLED UP IN THE STUDY YOU COULD POTENTIALLY DRAW EITHER THE FLESH EATER OR ICY GHOUL CARD THESE HAVE A SPAWN TRIGGER FOR THE ATTIC OR CELLAR RESPECTIVELY IF THE INVESTIGATORS HAVEN'T ADVANCED THE ACT DECK YET NEITHER OF THESE LOCATIONS ARE IN PLAY AND THE MONSTER TECHNICALLY CAN'T SPAWN AS FAR AS I'M AWARE THIS IS THE ONLY SPOT IN THE CORE SET CAMPAIGN WHERE THIS CAN COME UP HOWEVER
IF THE LOCATION ISN'T IN PLAY THEN IT IS DISCARDED SEE PAGE OF THE RULES REFERENCE
SIMPLY DISCARD THE MONSTER
WHICH MONSTER DID THIS HAPPEN WITH WE'VE PLAYED THROUGH ALL THREE SCENARIOS AT LEAST ONCE AND NOT COME ACROSS THIS POSSIBILITY SO FAR
DID YOU MAYBE SHUFFLE A CARD INTO THE DECK THAT WAS MEANT TO BE SET ASIDE I'VE NOT ENCOUNTERED THIS SITUATION AND I WOULD IMAGINE THE GAME WAS EXTENSIVELY PLAY TESTED TO AVOID THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENING
YOU MIGHT HAVE A WRONG CARD IN THE DECK DOUBLE CHECK THE SYMBOLS I DID THE EXACT SAME THING
THIS IS FOR THE NARRATIVE ADVENTURE STORYTELLING ELEMENTS RATHER THAN THE MECHANICS BUT TALES OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS IS CLOSE TO RECORD LOW PRICES ON AMAZON CURRENTLY AT IF YOU SOMETIMES HAVE FOUR OR LESS PEOPLE IN YOUR GROUP I RECOMMEND IT
MICE AND MYSTICS HAS A REALLY FUN COOP FEEL BEING A TACTICAL GAME WITH A SMALL BOARD AND A FEW BADDIES TO THWART AND A WONDERFULLY DARK WARM THEME
PANDEMIC LEGACY
TENSE I MASCULINE E STORIES DOES THIS VERY WELL
VAULT COMES TO MIND YOU ALL HAVE CARDS WITH PEOPLE PLACES AND THINGS ON THEM THAT YOU PLAY TO THE CENTER OF THE TABLE FOR POINTS AND YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY FIT INTO THE ONGOING NARRATIVE EACH CARD YOU PLAY EARNS YOU POWER TO RESURRECT YOUR SPECIFIC ELDER GOD THE GAME STARTS OUT COOPERATIVE UNTIL ONE OF YOU RAISES YOUR OLD ONE AND THEN EVERYONE HAS TO TRY TO TAKE YOU DOWN OUR GROUP ENJOYED IT
IS IT OKAY THAT I'M MOST EXCITED FOR BATMAN ZOMBIE DICE THAT'S OKAY RIGHT


BUT A MUNCHKIN CCC CHRIST
THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A SORT OF YOU IDIOTS WILL BUY ANYTHING QUALITY TO THE DECISION TO DESIGN AND MARKET A MUNCHKIN CCC
I DIDN'T SEE ANY NEGATIVE VIBES FROM PLAYTESTERS SOUNDS LIKE THEY FOUND A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD LOVE THE GAME TO DO THEIR PLAYTESTING
GAMES IN FIRST PLACE HAS DONE NOTHING BUT EXPLORE AND 2ND PLACE HAS DONE A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING BUT MOSTLY COLONIES I WOULD POSIT THE OPPOSITE THAT EXPLORATION IS INCREDIBLY OVERPOWERED AND THAT ANYONE WHO FEELS OTHERWISE IS INCREDIBLY BAD AT THE GAME


ALOT OF YOUR POINTS ARE FLAWED AS WELL

IF IT IS SO EASY TO SAIL OUT AND BUY GOOD AND THEN SAIL THEM HOME AND BUILD THEN WHY WERE YOU SO FAR AWAY FROM GETTING A COLONY YOUR FIRST GAME YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T EVEN CLOSE BUT IF THAT IS THE EASIEST ACTION THEN I DON'T FOLLOW IT'S NOT THE EXACT SAME AS BUILDING A CHEAP BUILDING BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO BUILDING OF THEM AND ACCORDING TO YOU THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BREEZE

NOT TO MENTION YOUR CHART ON GLORY COMPLETELY IGNORES HOW EXPLORATION AND RAIDING IS AWARDED AND THE ACTIONS REQUIRED TO DO THEM EXPLORING LITERALLY TAKES ONE ACTION AND YOU GET GLORY PLUS ANY REWARDS THAT CAN RANGE FROM A GOOD TO VP 2 GOODS IN BURIAL SITES THE HIGHER THE SITE THE HIGHER THE REWARD SO THEY AREN'T STAGNANT AT ALL EXPLORING AT SEA ADDS THE POINTS FOR THE LOCATION SO IT'S NOT VP TO EXPLORE IT NEVER IS EVEN AT THE WORST LOCATIONS

BUILDING A BUILDING REQUIRES BUYING THE GOODS SAILING HOME BUILDING AT DISCOUNT WHICH IS 2 REVOLVING ACTIONS IT IS SURE FIRE POINTS BUT IT TAKES MORE TIME TO CONTINUALLY DO THAT AND ALL THE WHILE YOU ARE SPENDING ALL YOUR MONEY SO YOU CAN'T BUY SURE FIRE POINTS IN TREASURE SAY YOU SPEND ON GOODS TURN YOU SAIL HOME AND BUILD FOR 2 COINS NEXT TURN YOU BUILD AND UPGRADE FOR COINS THAT IS ALL YOUR MONEY SO YOU HAVE TO SAIL AND TAX THEN BUY AND SAIL HOME YOU ARE NOW AT TURN WITH STILL GLORY AND ONLY GOOD TO YOUR NAME

IF I RAID A SAIL SPOT AT DEFENSE I GET THE GLORY I GET A YELLOW SAIL AND I GET A GLORY FOR THAT YELLOW SAIL SO THAT IS 2 VP AND A NICE TO EXPLORE JUST OFF OF ONE ACTION

IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THE GAME IS BAD THAT IS PROBABLY AGREED BY MOST PEOPLE IT'S ANOTHER TO SAY THE GAME IS RANDOMLY SWINGY THAT IS PROBABLY TRUE BECAUSE THE REWARD RANGE ON EXPLORATION IS ABSURD BUT TO SAY A GAME IS BROKEN AND THEN NOT GIVE ALL THE RULES AND TO REALLY CONTRADICT YOUR OWN POINTS IS ASININE
APPLAUDS

IT'S EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF EMOTION A DESIGNER SHOULD TRY TO PREVENT I WONDER WHAT THE PLAYTESTERS DID PLAID HAT IS KNOWN FOR QUALITY PLAYTESTING SO WAS THE AWE OF NEXT LEGACY GAME BLINDING EVERYBODY OR NO ONE DARED TO SAY ANYTHING
I WOULD SAY THAT THIS GAME HAS DELIVERED ME THE SINGLE WORST GAMING SESSION THAT I'VE EVER HAD AND IT TOOK AROUND HOURS FOR IT TO END

I DETAILED IT HERE BUT THE ACTUAL DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENTS ARE A BIT NEVERTHELESS I THINK I'VE IDENTIFIED THE MAIN ISSUES THAT REALLY DRAGGED THINGS DOWN FOR ME

HUGE SWINGS IN GLORY THAT COULDN'T REALLY BE PLANNED FOR AHEAD OF TIME TWO PEOPLE BEING AWARDED GLORY OUT OF ON TURN 2
RULE CHANGES OR MILESTONES THAT COULD NOT BE PLANNED FOR AND ARE CLAIMED BY WHOMEVER IS CLOSEST TO THE RANDOM EVENT COUPLED WITH THE ABOVE IT CAN BE GAME CHANGING
AGAIN DUE TO THE PREVIOUS TWO POINTS THE FACT THAT THE GAME CAN END SWIFTLY WITHOUT WARNING AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A CLOSING TURN TO FINISH WHATEVER YOU CAN MEANS THAT MANY GAMES END WITH ONE OR TWO PEOPLE HAVING A BOAT LOAD OF RESOURCES THAT THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEY PROBABLY WASTED HALF THE GAME COLLECTING THEM ONLY FOR A NEW GLORY SOURCE TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE CURRENT GAME
DUE TO THE SUDDENNESS OF GAME END EARLY CAMPAIGN LEADS SEEM TO BE MORE ABOUT RANDOM SAMPLING OF TIMING RATHER THAN OVERALL BETTER PLAY
FINALLY LET'S SAY YOU'VE HAD GOOD FORTUNE IN THE FIRST FEW GAMES THE CATCH-UP MECHANIC IS GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS EVENTUALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO SIT AT THE TABLE KNOWING THAT THERE'S VERY LITTLE CHANCE WINNING SO YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON MINOR TASKS HOWEVER BECAUSE THE GAME CAN BE SO SWINGY EVEN YOUR MINOR TASK MAY NOT BE ACCOMPLISHABLE IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE TABLES NEED TO BE BALANCED SOMEHOW BUT IT CAN LEAD TO GAMES WHICH ARE NOT VERY ENJOYABLE TO PLAY
ON TOP OF THIS THE MECHANICS RIGHTFULLY HAVE PEOPLE TARGETING THE CAMPAIGN LEADER THE PERSON WHO MAY ALREADY BE HAVING A CRAPPIER GAME DUE TO CATCH-UP MECHANICS THAT MAKES FOR A MISERABLE SESSION THAT YOU ARE JUST SITTING THROUGH

I ENJOY SOME OF THE MECHANICS BUT I THINK SOME OF THE OTHER MECHANICS DETRACT FROM WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER GAME IT COULD BE THAT SOME TWEAKS TO GAME END CONDITIONS AND OR A FEW OTHER ISSUES MAY HAVE REALLY HELPED I THINK A ENDGAME WOULD HELP AND I WISH THERE WAS A BETTER WAY TO VALUE CERTAIN EVENTS OR ACHIEVEMENTS WITHOUT LITERALLY WAITING UNTIL THEY HAPPEN
IF THE GOAL OF THE GAME IS TO COLLECT GLORY WHY ARE YOU NOT FOLLOWING A STRATEGY THAT NETS YOU THE MOST GLORY WITHIN THE SPAN OF THE GAME
GOLD TREASURE GLORY
GOLD TREASURE GLORY

UH GOLD TREASURES ARE 2 GLORY
YEAH ONE PLAYER WAS REALLY UPSET ONE GAME WHERE I ENDED THE GAME ONE TURN BEFORE HE COULD FOUND THE 1ST COLONY SORRY BUDDY ALL THAT WORK WAS FOR NOTHING NOW DUMP ALL THOSE GOODS INTO THE SEA OF COURSE TWO GAMES LATER HE MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH ANOTHER PLAYER TO SINK MY TWO SHIPS ABOUT TO FOUND A COLONY PRETTY MUCH INVALIDATING MY WHOLE GAME FUN
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE ONLY OPENED THE FIRST TWO BOXES AND I THINK YOU MAY HAVE A SKEWED IMPRESSION OF WHAT THE DOMINANT STRATEGY IS IN SEAWALL DUE TO THE SECOND HEAVY EMPHASIS ON MERCANTILE ACTIVITIES

REGARDING THE FIRST GAME YOU'RE OMITTING THE FACT THAT THERE IS A MILESTONE FOR BUILDING THREE STRUCTURES SO THE WINNING PLAYER OBVIOUSLY WAS GOING AFTER THAT EVEN WITH THE MILESTONE THAT WOULD HAVE ONLY NETTED HIM OF THE REQUIRED GLORY SO HE HAD TO HAVE DONE THINGS OTHER THAN JUST BUILD STRUCTURES SOUNDS LIKE HE USED THE RENOWNED BUILDER FOR ADDITIONAL GLORY BUT HE STILL HAD TO HAVE RAIDED OR BUILT UPGRADES OR EXPLORED AT SOME POINT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH THIS IS THE SAME STRATEGY I EMPLOYED IN MY FIRST GAME OF SEAWALL AND WON IT'S GENERALLY A GOOD THING TO DO STUFF THAT GETS YOU MILESTONES

REGARDING THE MILESTONE FOR GETTING THREE COLONIES IT ISN'T JUST WORTH GLORY YOU GET A PERMANENT UPGRADE TO YOUR PROVINCE YOU GET THE GLORY FOR BUILDING THE COLONIES YOU GET GLORY FOR EACH COLONY YOU ACTIVATE IN THAT GAME AND ALL FUTURE GAMES AND YOU GET THE ASSOCIATED BONUSES FOR THE ACTIVE COLONIES I ONLY HAVE ONE COLONY IN MY GAME BUT IT'S THE ONE THAT GIVES ME SUCCESS TO ALL EXPLORE ENDEAVORS WITHIN SPACES WHICH HAS BEEN A HUGE HELP FOR EXPLORATION ASSUMING I ACTIVATE IT EVERY GAME AND OUR CAMPAIGN LASTS GAMES IT WILL NET ME A TOTAL OF GLORY OVER THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD

YOU'RE IGNORING A NUMBER OF THINGS ABOUT POINTS YOU GET FOR ENDEAVORS ACTIONS EXPLORING SITES TYPICALLY GIVES YOU ADDITIONAL REWARDS INCLUDING BONUS GLORY IT'S TYPICAL TO GET GLORY FOR EXPLORATION ENDEAVORS LATER IN THE GAME RAIDING SITES GIVES YOU BETTER REWARDS YOU GET 2 GLORY FOR RAIDING DOCKS BECAUSE OF THE FREE SHIP UPGRADE THERE ARE STRUCTURES AND UPGRADES THAT ARE WORTH ADDITIONAL GLORY LATER IN THE CAMPAIGN AND MORE EXPENSIVE STRUCTURES UPGRADES TYPICALLY GIVE YOU BETTER BENEFITS
MY GROUP IS STILL LOVING IT AND THIS IS NOT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THIS GAME AT ALL WE HAVE NO PROBLEM SEPARATING MECHANICS VS GAME STORY FOR THIS GAME

AS FOR HAVING GOLD STARTING IN THE NEXT GAME IN OUR EXPERIENCE THAT MEANS YOU DO A BUILDER ACTION TO BUY AN UPGRADE AND SAIL AWAY AND OR SAIL AND THEN PURCHASE GOODS YOU GET A SIGNIFICANT LEG UP ON PURCHASE POWER YOU ALSO HAVE STARTING ENMITY WHICH CAN GIVE YOU AN ADVANTAGE TO RAID SOMEONE'S VAULT FOR A BETTER GOLD ADVANTAGE OR GO AHEAD AND TRY TO GRAB THEIR ADVISER

OP PERHAPS THIS CAN BE YOUR COME TO JESUS MOMENT AND REALIZE IT'S JUST NOT A GAME FOR YOU I'D TALK TO YOUR GROUP ABOUT THE YOU'RE HAVING AND GRACEFULLY EXIT SO THEY CAN ENJOY IT I FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD GET ME DOWN TO HEAR THIS IS THE EXPERIENCE ANOTHER IN MY GROUP WAS HAVING AND I'D RATHER NOT WASTE THEIR TIME
A FEW THOUGHTS FROM GAMES IN AND BOXES OPEN SPOILERS UP TO BOX 2 THIS IS COMING FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEONE VERY MUCH ENJOYING THE GAME

IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR GAME DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF PVP RAIDING STEALING OTHER PEOPLES OP ADVISORS AND SINKING THEIR SHIPS FULL OF UPGRADES IS BAKED INTO THE GAME AS A BALANCING FACTOR IF YOU TAKE A MERCANTILIST STRATEGY EITHER YOU COMMIT RESOURCES TO DEFENDING AGAINST RAIDS OR YOU LEAVE YOURSELF OPEN ENMITY MEANS ONE PLAYER DOESN'T GET TOO HOSED IN A SINGLE GAME BUT PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO WIN GAME AFTER GAME WITH THE SAME STRATEGY ESPECIALLY IF PEOPLE ACTIVELY DISRUPT THEM

COLONIES ARE NOWHERE AS WEAK AS YOU INDICATE YOU GET GLORY THE GAME YOU FOUND IT AND AN ADDITIONAL GLORY IN EVERY FUTURE GAME YOU ACTIVATE IT PLUS YOUR SPECIFIC COLONY PERK YES FOUNDING THEM IS TOUGH AND YOU MIGHT GET UNLUCKY AND HAVE THE GAME END BEFORE YOU GET ONE BUT THE CATCH UP MECHANIC SEEMS ALMOST TAILOR MADE FOR BUILDING COLONIES FASTER THAN OPPONENTS IN MY GAME THERE ARE TWO PLAYERS WHO HAVE SET BIG CHUNKS OF THEIR STRATEGY AROUND SPECIFIC COLONY PERKS SO THEY DEFINITELY HAVE VALUE

I WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR DOMINANT STRATEGY ASSESSMENT REGARDING BUILDINGS THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE ISN'T ONE THE DOMINANT STRATEGY IS GETTING MILESTONES FOR THE MASSIVE GLORY BOOST AND THE PERMANENT UPGRADE BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY ONE PLAYER GETTING ALL THE MILESTONES IS ABSURDLY LOW AND THE MILESTONES ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE VARYING YOUR STRATEGY GAME TO GAME OVER THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND WHILE DIFFICULT YOU CAN WIN WITHOUT THEM OR AT THE VERY LEAST PUT YOURSELF IN A BETTER POSITION FOR THE NEXT GAME THERE WAS ONE GAME WHERE I WAS UNLIKELY TO WIN BUT THE OTHER PLAYERS WERE RACING FOR A TIME-CONSUMING MILESTONE I USED THAT GAME TO GRAB MY FIRST COLONY AND LOAD UP ON RESEARCH CARDS TO BOOST MY FUTURE EXPLORE ACTIONS

WON'T GET TOO SPECIFIC BUT LATER IN THE CAMPAIGN EXPLORATION GETS REALLY GOOD MAYBE THAT EXPLORE SITE MIGHT BE WORTH MORE THAN JUST GLORY I WILL SAY THAT HAVING THAT REWARD HIDDEN IS NOT MY FAVORITE CHOICE FOR THE GAME DESIGN FEELS REALLY GOOD FOR THE PERSON EXPLORING BUT IT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND MAKES EVERYONE ELSE SUDDENLY REEVALUATE THEIR STRATEGY MID GAME

ALL THAT BEING SAID IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT HAVING A GRAND TIME WITH THE GAME IF YOU WANT TO KEEP PLAYING I'D RECOMMEND A THOROUGH REREADING OF THE RULES AS YOUR POST INDICATES SOME SUBSTANTIAL MISUNDERSTANDINGS ALSO KNOW THAT EXPLORATION DOES BECOME MORE VALUABLE HOPEFULLY YOUR EXPERIENCE TURNS AROUND OR YOU FIND ANOTHER LEGACY GAME IN THE FUTURE YOU ENJOY MORE THOROUGHLY
THE MORE I READ ABOUT THIS GAME THE MORE SECURE I FEEL THAT I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION WE THE GAME BUT AFTER REVIEWS DECIDED WE WOULDN'T LIKE IT SO WE SOLD IT UNOPENED AND KEPT THE METAL COINS TECHNICALLY WE TOOK A LOSS BUT THAT TRANSLATES INTO PAYING FOR AN AWESOME SET OF METAL COINS THAT NOW RESIDE IN OUR COPY OF TERRA MYSTIC
YOUR POINTS ARE GARBAGE I'M ON A TABLET SO I CAN'T GO THROUGH EM ALL THE MOST POINTS YOU CAN GET FROM BUILDINGS AND UPGRADES IS ON YOUR PROVINCE BOARD SO THEY ARE GETTING POINTS ANOTHER WAY AND MAKING COLONIES NETS YOU POINTS BEFORE CONSIDERING THE MILESTONE WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THE MORE EXPENSIVE UPGRADES BUILDINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE BETTER SCREW THE GLORY LATER GAMES YOU NEED THAT EXTRA RAID AND EXPLORE BUILDING A COLONY IS POINTS HOW THE HELL IS THAT THE SAME AS THE GLORY YOU GET MAKING A BUILDING IN YOUR PROVINCE ALSO THE REWARDS FOR EXPLORING HIGHER LEVEL AREAS IS THAT THEY GIVE BETTER REWARDS ALSO PROVINCES CAN BE RAIDED LIKE TIMES A YEAR JUST THE SAME AREA CAN'T BE RAIDED HOW CAN PEOPLE COMPLAIN SO MUCH WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE DAMN GAME
THIS REVIEW EXPRESSES WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE GAME FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW IT'S NOT BROKEN AT ALL
I'VE BEEN WINNING MOST OF THE GAMES AND I DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THERE'S A LOT OF INCREMENTAL GLORY YOU CAN PICK UP ALONG THE WAY LIKE RAIDING FOR A RESOURCE YOU NEED INSTEAD OF TRADING AND I USUALLY FOCUS ON MILESTONES WHICH REQUIRE YOU TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND DICTATE MY UPGRADE PATHS FOR THE NEXT GAME

BUT FOR EXAMPLE I'LL GET GLORY FROM RAIDING FOR RESOURCES GLORY FOR THE UPGRADE I BUY TO DO EXPLORING THEN GET POINTS FOR EXPLORING A NEW ISLAND THEN COMPLETE A MILESTONE AND BUY A TREASURE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF POINTS

ALL MY GAMES I FELT LIKE I'VE REALLY GOTTEN A LOT OF POINTS SPREAD OUT OVER DOING DIFFERENT THINGS

SORRY YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN BUT YOU CAN'T DECLARE A GAME MECHANICALLY BROKEN BECAUSE YOU'VE PLAYED FOUR GAMES OF IT AND DIDN'T LIKE IT YOU SEEM TO TOTALLY DISCOUNT THAT YOU MAY NOT BE DOING THINGS IN THE OPTIMAL WAY RATHER THAN JUST WHAT YOU THINK IS THE OPTIMAL WAY AND ON TOP OF THAT IT SEEMS YOU'VE GOTTEN A COUPLE OF RULES WRONG

I DON'T KNOW I DON'T GET IT I HAVE NO INTEREST IN AN INTERNET ARGUMENT AND I'M NOT EVEN TRYING TO CHANGE YOUR MIND HERE JUST FIND IT STRANGE WHEN PEOPLE FEEL COMPELLED TO MAKE BROAD SWEEPING OBJECTIVE STATEMENTS BASED ON THEIR OWN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT MOVE ON ME AND MY GROUP ARE HAVING A BLAST WITH IT
INTERESTING THAT YOU GUYS DIG PANDEMIC AS MUCH AS YOU DO CONSIDERING THE ABILITY TO EXTRAPOLATE POSSIBLE MOVES BETWEEN FOR TURNS AND TURNS INTO THE FUTURE TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM BENEFIT

I'D HUMBLY SUBMIT LORD OF WATERDEEP TO BE CHECKED OUT IT'S A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME WITH TONS OF LOVE AND ACCOLADES ON THIS SUB AND IN THE MARKET IT HAS A FANTASY IND THEME AND A VERY MANAGEABLE RULES WEIGHT IT IS ALSO FANTASTIC AT AND STILL PRETTY SOLID AT
VITICULTURE EE GREAT WORKER PLACEMENT GAME ABOUT MAKING WINE

COLORETTO SIMPLE SET COLLECTING GAME WITH SOME INTERESTING TWISTS WITH THE SCORING

QUADROPOLIS QUICK CITY BUILDING GAME IT PLAYS IN ABOUT AN HOUR

TWO PLAYER GAMES PATCHWORK AND MARGI ARE BOTH GREAT

EMET QUICK PACED DUDES ON A MAP GAME MAYBE SOME AP AROUND UPGRADE SELECTION BUT OTHERWISE SHOULD BE PRETTY SMOOTH SAILING
I THINK VITICULTURE ESSENTIAL EDITION AND NEW BEDFORD ARE GOOD OPTIONS FOR THAT DON'T SEEM TO TRIGGER MUCH AP IN MY EXPERIENCE I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND EMPIRE LEGENDS FOR A GREAT QUICK AREA CONTROL GAME ABYSS IS ENJOYED BY EVERYONE I'VE PLAYED IT WITH THOUGH I CAN'T COMMENT ON HOW GOOD THE 2 PLAYER GAME IS ANOTHER CO-OP THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT IS BLACK ORCHESTRA MY COPY HASN'T ARRIVED YET BUT I'VE GOT IT ON ORDER AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO PLOTTING TO ASSASSINATE HITLER

FYI IT HAS ITS OWN SUB REDDIN WHERE YOU CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REQUESTS

R BOARDGAMERECOMMENDER
LOTS OF GAMES ARE DESIGNED FOR TWO PLAYERS LIKE PATCHWORK STAR REALMS OR HIVE

SPLENDOR RED HANAFI PANDEMIC CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG PAPERBACK VALLEY OF THE KINGS AND GLOOM IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE A LITTLE CREATIVE ARE ALL FUN 2 PLAYER PLUS MY BOYFRIEND AND I LIKE TO MIX AND MATCH CARCASSONNE EXPANSIONS WE HAVE ABOUT AND USUALLY PICK TWO AT RANDOM TO MIX IN AND KEEP IT INTERESTING


THE LIST CAN GET QUITE LENGTHY WE PLAY ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY AS JUST THE TWO OF US SO WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T

AMONG MY SPECIFIC GAMES

RAVENS
STAR REALMS BUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE DOMINION YOU MAY NOT DIG IT
WONDERS DUEL
MARGI
PATCHWORK
NETRUNNER ANOTHER DECK BUILDER THOUGH SO MAYBE NOT FOR YOU
AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES BIG AND SMALL OUT OF PRINT AGAIN I THINK
JAIPUR


OF OTHER 2 GAMES

ISLE OF SKYE SINCE YOU LIKE CARCASSONNE THIS IS HIGH ON MY RECOMMENDATION LIST
BURGLE BROS
ORLEANS
SAN JUAN
RUN FIGHT OR DIE
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY
STAR TREK PANIC
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY
PANDEMIC EVERYTHING
ZOMBICIDE
SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE
ESCAPE THE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE
THE GAME VERY LIGHT
CATAN DICE ALSO VERY LIGHT
ELDER SIGN
LANTERNS
LORDS OF WATERDEEP

WARNING RIVALS FOR CATAN IS A VERY DIFFERENT GAME THAN SETTLERS OF CATAN IF YOU LOVE CATAN I JUST WANT YOU TO GO IN WITH PROPER EXPECTATIONS
WONDERS DUEL AND SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE ARE TWO GEMS
OH ALSO PAPERBACK
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY PLAYS VERY WELL AT 2 PLAYERS ALL THAT BEING SAID I REALLY LIKE AGRICOLA AT TWO TOO LORDS OF WATERDEEP PLAYS BEST WITH MORE PLAYERS BUT IS STILL GREAT FUN AT
CHECK OUT RIVALS FOR CATAN IT IS A CARD VERSION OF CATAN IT PLAYS DIFFERENTLY THAN REGULAR CATAN BUT SHOULD STILL GIVE YOU THAT FAMILIAR VIBE

IS ANOTHER GREAT GAME THAT I NEED TO THROW OUT THERE SINCE IT IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FOR PLAY

WHAT IS IT YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT DOMINION PERHAPS THERE IS A DIFFERENT THAT MAY APPEAL TO BOTH OF YOU


WE PLAY PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY FAVORITES ARE

GALAXY TRUCKER

FORBIDDEN STARS

MARKHAM HORROR CARD GAME ELDRITCH HORROR MARKHAM HORROR

DEAD OF WINTER

LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL

SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE

PANDEMIC

STAR REALMS

FLASH POINT

HANAFI

MERCHANTS MARAUDERS

DESCENT
OF MY COLLECTION IS DEDICATED TO 2 PLAYER GAMING WITH RATINGS BASED LARGELY ON THAT EXPERIENCE LINK
WONDERS DUELS IS REAL GODLIKE
JAIPUR DREAMWELL BIBLIOG MY HUSBAND AND I PLAY THESE THREE ALL THE TIME
WONDERS DUEL EVOLUTION THE BEGINNING AND THE RAVENS OF HRI SAHASHRI ARE BIG HITS FOR MY WIFE AND I
WE LIKE SEASONS AND SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE
TERRAFORMING MARS
CHESS

MIGHT SOUND LIKE A SMART ASS ANSWER BUT IT REALLY IS THE ORIGINAL AND YOU IT'S NOT A REAL HOME UNTIL THERE'S A CHESSBOARD LYING AROUND SOMEWHERE
TUMMYSTICKS
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE KEYFLOWER WITH THE MERCHANTS OPHIR URBAN SPRAWL AKROTIRI AND WONDERS DUEL
THE DIFFICULTY DEFINITELY RAMPS UP BUT THE MAIN THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT THE GAME ITSELF IS CHANGING THE MOST AVID AND COMPETENT PANDEMIC PLAYER IN OUR GROUP WAS ACTUALLY THE ONE MOST PRONE TO MISTAKES BECAUSE HE KEPT TRYING TO GET US TO STRATEGIZE AND PLAY THE GAME LIKE IT WAS VANILLA PANDEMIC ONCE YOU HIT APRIL THAT REALLY DOESN'T FLY ANY MORE HONESTLY MY BIGGEST LOSSES IN PANDEMIC LEGACY CAME FROM US NOT QUICKLY TWEAKING OUR STRATEGY ENOUGH IN RESPONSE TO THE CONTINUOUS CHANGES IN THE GAME BECAUSE WE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO REGULAR PANDEMIC

ALSO YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THAT THE GOAL IS TO WIN THE CAMPAIGN NOT EACH INDIVIDUAL GAME WE MADE A LOT OF DECISIONS THAT WERE STRATEGIC IN TERMS OF THE CURRENT GAME OR THE VERY NEXT GAME WE WERE GOING TO PLAY BUT NOT SO MUCH IN TERMS OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN STILL IN FRONT OF US SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP A BATTLE IN ORDER TO TAKE THE TIME AND SET YOURSELF UP BETTER FOR THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN
MIGHT WANT TO REREAD THE RUES TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE PLAYING CORRECTLY
SOMETHING THAT I THINK HELPS A LOT IS KNOWING THAT YOU SET UP THE BOARD THEN SELECT YOUR PEOPLE THIS REALLY HELPS IN PREVENTING TO MANY OUTBREAKS AND ALLOWS MORE STRATEGY
MY GROUP IS ONLY AT JUNE SO I CAN'T GIVE HELP FURTHER ALONG BUT I THINK WE'VE LOST TIMES I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S THE EASIEST GAME OUT THERE BUT I DO FEEL LIKE EVERY GAME WE'RE GOING TO WIN EVEN IF IT GETS SCARY MOST OF OUR LOSSES END UP BECAUSE WE RUN OUT OF PLAYER CARDS SO THE GAME JUST ENDS AND AS SOON AS I REALIZE THAT I CAN SEE HOW WE COULD HAVE WON WITH JUST MORE TURNS SO WE WERE ON THE RIGHT PATH BUT JUST NEEDED TO BE FASTER

SINCE WE CAN'T GET TOO SPECIFIC CAN YOU IDENTIFY WHAT IS CAUSING YOUR LOSSES
TOO MANY PANDEMICS
RUNNING OUT OF PLAYER CARDS LIKE MY GROUP
UTILIZING STARTER RESEARCH STATIONS TO START AT OR MOVE TO THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AREAS
USING THE SAME CHARACTERS OR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS EACH TIME
IS YOUR MEDIC THE HERO OF THE GAME OR ARE YOU RELYING ON OTHER CHARACTERS TO PULL THE MOST WEIGHT
WE MADE A COUPLE SMALL RULE MISTAKES THAT MADE THE GAME TOO EASY AND THEN WE THOUGHT WE FIXED IT WHICH MADE THE GAME IMPOSSIBLY HARD MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING THIS RIGHT

SPOILER FOR JUNE SPOILER S WE TOTALLY FORGOT FOR A FEW GAMES THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO ADD A FADED FIGURE EACH TIME YOU DRAW A FADED CITY CARD FROM THE PLAYER DECK SO WE FOUND THAT WE HAD A FEW EASY GAMES IN A ROW I DOUBLE CHECKED THE RULES AND REALISED WE MISSED IT SO THEN WE STARTED ADDING THE FADED FIGURES WHEN WE DREW FROM THAT DECK HOWEVER YOU ONLY ADD A FIGURE IF THE CARD YOU DRAW FROM THE PLAYER DECK IS FROM A CITY IN THE ORIGINAL COLOUR OF THE FADED YOU DO NOT ADD A FIGURE IF IT'S A CITY THAT HAS BECOME FADED BECAUSE THE FADED HAVE SPREAD OUT OF THEIR REGION ONCE WE DISCOVERED THIS WE REALISED WHY THE GAME WAS IMPOSSIBLY HARD AND NOW ARE BACK ON TRACK IN A SENSE REPLACING A RULE THAT MADE THE GAME TEMPORARILY TOO EASY FOR ONE THAT MADE IT TEMPORARILY TOO DIFFICULT PROBABLY EVENED IT OUT FOR US
THIRD LOST IN JUNE AND ALREADY DISHEARTENED LOSING AND THE GAME IS TOO HARD WHY PLAY A GAME WHERE YOU CAN ALWAYS WIN

I RUN TWO BOXES OF PANDEMIC RED GROUP IS ELITE PLAYERS BLUE GROUP IS ABOVE AVERAGE HARDCORE

BLUE LOST FIRST THREE GAMES BUT THE BOARD IS A LOT BETTER THAN RED IN NOVEMBER

RED WON MANY GAMES UNTIL THE FUNDING WAS ZERO BUT THE BOARD LOOKS WORST THAN BLUE

THE DYNAMIC DIFFICULTY IS GREAT IT'S NOT TOO HARD NOR TOO EASY IT SCALES WELL AND IS OUR LEGACY FAVOURITE BETTER THAN SEAWALL

JUST ENJOY THE RIDE DON'T GET DEMORALISED SOMETIMES IT'S JUST THE CARD DRAW
WE LOST THREE STRAIGHT GAMES IN MARCH APRIL AND THEN AGAIN IN NOVEMBER DECEMBER I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S HARD BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST GET UNLUCKY WITH YOUR CARD DRAWS RELAX AND ENJOY THE STORY
MY GROUP ALSO LOST THREE IN A ROW AROUND THAT TIME BEFORE TURNING IT AROUND SOME OF OUR LOSSES WERE JUST REALLY BAD LUCK OTHERS WERE US GETTING TOO COCKY
THINGS TO REMEMBER ALWAYS HAVE AT LEAST ONE PERSON ON CURE DUTY

WHEN GIVEN THE NEW OBJECTIVE TYPES NON STANDARD PANDEMIC STUFF MAKE SURE TO UTILIZE THE NEW CHARACTERS WHOM ARE DESIGNED TO TACKLE THOSE ISSUES THE NEW PROBLEMS THE GAME INTRODUCES WILL BE EXTREMELY HARD TO TACKLE WITHOUT THEM CODA IS NO JOKE


ALWAYS AIM TO ERADICATE A DISEASE THAT HAS LOW CUBES IN THE EARLY GAME IF POSSIBLE THOSE END OF GAME UPGRADES FOR DISEASES MAKE TACKLING THAT ISSUE EASIER AND EASIER


USE SOME OF THE SPECIAL CHARACTERS ABILITIES TO PREVENT OUTBREAKS WHEN POSSIBLE THE GAME REQUIRE A LOT MORE TACTICAL FOR THOUGHT AND PLANNING AS OTHERS HAVE SAID DON'T BE AFRAID TO LOSE A GAME BUT LEAVE THE BOARD NOT IN SHAMBLES

COMMON ISSUES WHENEVER A CHARACTER IS PLAYED FOR THE FIRST TIME MAKE SURE THEY GET A RELATIONSHIP STICKER ALWAYS UPGRADE CHARACTERS WHOM DON'T HAVE SCARS

FINAL TIP SINCE YOU SHUFFLE THE OUTBREAK CARDS DON'T BE AFRAID TO ADD A FEW MORE CARDS TO THE EARLY GAME PILES AND LESS TO THE LATER GAME ONES IT CAN GIVE YOU AN EASIER EARLY GAME WHICH CAN SECURE CERTAIN MONTHS

WE HAD A LOT OF STRUGGLES WITH SURPRISE EPIDEMICS AND RUNNING OUT OF THE PLAYER DECK THEN WE STARTED TRACKING THE INFECTION DECK ONE PLAYER HAS A SHEET THAT LISTS EVERY INFECTION CARD WE HAVE SEEN AND AFTER THE FIRST EPIDEMIC WE ADD CHECK MARKS AS THE CITIES COME BACK
SPOILERS
IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR CHOICES BETWEEN GAMES HERE IS WHAT MADE PL VERY EASY

CHOOSE RIVALS RELATIONSHIP UPGRADE TO PICK UP DISCARDED CARDS
USE QUARANTINE LADY AND MEDIC ALWAYS QUARANTINE TROUBLE SPOTS
MAKE RESEARCH STATION PERMANENT LATER MILITARY STATIONS TOO
MAKE ROADBLOCKS AROUND THAT AREA PERMANENT TO STOP THE SPREAD
GET PILOT SKILL UPGRADE
EDIT ALSO FORGOT TO ADD TO MAKE DISEASES EASIER TO CURE WHENEVER YOU CANT DO THE ABOVE POINTS

SORRY I AM WRITING IT FROM MY PHONE SO I AM NOT SURE HOW TO COVER SPOILERS I HOPE I AM NOT SPOILING TOO MUCH FROM THE STORY
I THINK BASED ON WHAT I'VE READ ON OTHERS GAMES IT DEPENDS A LOT ON WHAT COLOR BECOMES CODA AND HOW MANY POSITIVE MUTATIONS YOU HAVE ON THE OTHERS FOR OUR GAME WE WERE VERY LUCK AND ALWAYS TRIED TO ERADICATE WHEN WE COULD SO WE COULD GET THE MUTATIONS ONCE WE GOT TO THE POINT WERE WE DIDN'T NEED TO SPEND ACTIONS OR BE AT A STATION TO MAKE THE CURE MADE THINGS A LOT EASIER BY BEING ABLE TO CURE IN THE FIELD WHILE HANDLING OTHER OBJECTIVES

AND AS OTHERS MENTIONED IT HELPS THAT IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL OFF A WIN LOOK FOR WAYS THAT YOU CAN SET YOURSELF UP BETTER FOR THE NEXT GAME HAVING TROUBLES GETTING AROUND TO DEAL WITH AREAS TRY TO BUILD A FEW STRUCTURES TO BE COME PERMANENT ECT

ALSO DON'T BE AFRAID TO LOOK FOR CREATIVE WAYS TO MAKE USE OF RELATIONSHIPS OR PERKS OUR TEAM ACTUALLY GOT A LAST TURN WIN BY MAKING USE OF THE RIVAL PERK AFTER HAVING TO DISCARD DUE TO HAND SIZE AND THE TWO RIVALS BEING ABLE TO DISCARD COLORS THE OTHER NEEDED TO GET LAST 2 CURES NEEDED
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I PLAYED THROUGH THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN AND IT WAS PRETTY EASY BUT ITS WORTH NOTING THAT PANDEMIC IS ALWAYS HARDER WITH MORE PLAYERS
YEAH PANDEMIC LEGACY WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OUR GROUP AS WELL I THINK A LOT OF PLAYERS HAVE PLAYER PANDEMIC TO DEATH AND THEY'LL OBVIOUSLY FIND THE GAME A LOT EASIER

LOOK AT IT THIS WAY ONE MORE LOSS AND YOU OPEN THE SECRET BOX
SO MY PLAYGROUND STRUGGLED EARLY ON IN THE GAME IN PART BECAUSE WE WERE STUBBORN AND SLOW TO USE THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES ADDED AS THE MONTHS WENT ON SOMETHING NEW WOULD BE ADDED TO THE GAME AND WE'D SAY HUH INTERESTING AND PLAY THE NEXT GAME WITHOUT IT AND WONDER WHY THINGS WERE SO CHALLENGING

IF YOU'RE LOSING DUE TO TOO MANY OUTBREAKS THEN THAT TELLS ME YOU MAY NOT BE ATTENDING TO THE CITIES THAT ARE READY TO POP AND YOU MAY NOT BE USING THE TECHNOLOGIES AND CHARACTERS THE GAME HAS THROWN YOUR WAY I'D RECOMMEND LOOKING AT YOUR ROLE SELECTIONS YOU COULD LIKELY USE ONE OR TWO MORE CHARACTERS EACH GAME WHO WILL EITHER CONTAIN AND TREAT DISEASE OR FACILITATE EASIER MOVEMENT TO HOTSHOTS THIS IS ARGUABLY MORE VALUABLE THAN IN BASE PANDEMIC BECAUSE THE PANIC LEVEL MECHANIC MEANS THAT OUTBREAKS DON'T JUST BRING YOU CLOSER TO GAME OVER THEY ALSO MAKE YOUR BOARD THAT MUCH HARDER TO NAVIGATE

YOU'RE SEASONED PANDEMIC PLAYERS SO I ASSUME YOU HAVE THE RULES DOWN PAT BUT IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HURT TO REREAD THE MANUAL TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING OR MAKING IT HARDER FOR YOURSELVES JUST IN CASE
MY GROUP DID OUR FIRST COUPLE SWINGS AT IT YESTERDAY WE GOT TROUNCED IN EARLY JANUARY LIKE LOST WITHIN MINUTES SECOND EPIDEMIC CARD FINISHED US DUE TO THE CHAIN REACTION OUTBREAKS

POPPED IN FOR LATE JANUARY AND WON BUT IT WAS CLOSE WE NEVER ERADICATED A SINGLE DISEASE
THIS MAY HELP
ITS A MOVEMENT PROGRAMMING GAME WITH VARIABLE PLAYER POWERS SIMILAR TO COLT EXPRESS BUT WITH A CAPTURE THE FLAG THEME THE CHARACTERS YOU MOVE AROUND THE BOARD ACTUALLY HOLD FLAGS SO YOU CAN STEAL OTHER PLAYER FLAGS AND SET UP TRAPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S PRETTY COOL YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT
FORBIDDEN DESERT TWO PLAYER IT WAS EXTREMELY TENSE WE HAD TO PLAY EVERY MOVE PERFECTLY ESPECIALLY GRABBING WATER AND HIDING FROM THE SUN AT THE RIGHT TIME WE AT THE END WE ENGLISH PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT A LOT
NOT ELDRITCH HORROR
FRIDAY
BEST I'VE EVER DONE WAS GHOST STORIES ON NORMAL SOME DAY WE'LL REVISIT IT AND TRY FOR NIGHTMARE
PANDEMIC WITH EPIDEMICS FROM ON THE BRINK AND EPIDEMICS A FEW TIMES PROBABLY A WIN RATE

IT GENUINELY REQUIRES A LUCKY DRAW TO BEGIN THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR NOT HAVING A TURN OR 2 EPIDEMIC BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO CONTROL THE BOARD AND SMASH OUT THOSE CURES I RECOMMEND REMOVING 2 CUBES FROM A CUBE CITY WHENEVER POSSIBLE ONE WOULD ONLY BE A TEMPORARY FIX BUT IS USUALLY A WASTE OF ACTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED ELSEWHERE

AND I'M VERY MUCH NOT IN THE CAMP THAT BELIEVES PANDEMIC IS ONLY AN OPTIMIZATION PUZZLE IF YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF INTERESTING EVENT CARDS AMONG THE TEAM YOU CAN PERFORM SOME ABSOLUTE MIRACLES

FOR THE RECORD MY GROUP HIT LOSSES IN A ROW IN LEGACY BUT NO-ONE EVER TALKS ABOUT THOSE JUST WORTH REMEMBERING THAT IF YOU'RE FEELING DISPIRITED WHEN OTHERS SAY HOW EASY IT IS
GHOST STORIES BEEN AGES THOUGH SO CAN'T REALLY ELABORATE I'M AFRAID
FRIDAY ONCE STILL HAVEN'T BEATEN IT AGAIN
RISE OF AUGUSTUS


EACH PERSON IS TRYING TO FULFILL THEIR OWN OBJECTIVE CARDS BY MATCHING SYMBOLS AND THE SYMBOLS ARE DRAWN OUT OF A BAG AND CALLED OUT TO THE GROUP
DREAMS IS A COOL TAKE ON BINGO COMBINED WITH A SLIDE PUZZLE
I LIKE TAKE IT EASY WHICH LONG PREDATES ARUBA IT'S ALL ABOUT TRYING TO BUILD DIFFERENT LINES OF COLOR TO SCORE POINTS THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PLAY MODES AND THERE ARE SOME OTHER GAMES IN THE SERIES THAT I HAVE NOT PLAYED TAKE IT EASY IS A NICE CHILL PUZZLE GAME
CITIES WHICH HAS BEEN REDESIGNED AS LIMES IS TERRIFIC
GALAXY TRUCKER IS FABULOUS RACE TO BUILD A SPACE SHIP OUT OF LIMITED PARTS THEN FLY CARGO ACROSS SPACE ENCOUNTERING OBSTACLES ALONG THE WAY

DEAD OF WINTER IS CO-OP TO SURVIVE BUT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN SECRET OBJECTIVE AND THERE MAY ALSO BE A BETRAYER

FORBIDDEN STARS IS PRETTY MUCH CAPTURE THE FLAG IN SPACE SUPER FUN LONGER GAME
FOR A FIEND I WOULD DEFINITELY GET BRENNAN HE'S FIENDISH
ONE EXPANSION IS TRICKY
THE EXPANSION CONTAINS ALL THE CARDS FOR A DECK THAT'S PLAYABLE BUT CAN'T BUILD DECKS AND IT HAS NO DICE SO HE WILL NEED YOURS

ADDITIONALLY ALL THE EXPANSION DECKS USE ALL TEN DICE OF A SINGLE COLOR SO WHICHEVER COLOR HE'S USING YOU CAN'T USE AT ALL

OF THE STANDALONE EXPANSION DECKS I DO LIKE FORESTDALE GIANTS
RIN IF HE PREFERS A ATTACKING STYLE BRENNEN IF HE PREFERS A CONTROL BURN STYLE LEO IF HE PREFERS BEING HARD TO HIT VICTORIA IF HE PREFERS TO MESS WITH PEOPLES DICE WHILE THERE ARE CARDS TO SUIT ALL STYLES IN THESE DECKS THOSE ARE THE GENERAL THEMES IN MY VIEW

ON BALANCE I'D SAY THAT DECK HAS THE BEST CARDS ON AVERAGE REGRESS BLOOD CHAINS FIRE ARCHER CHOKE ALL HAVE GOOD GENERAL UTILITY ALTHOUGH DECK INCLUDES FROSTBACK BEAR WHICH IS MORE OR LESS A CORNERSTONE UNIT OF ANY DECK USING NATURE DICE AT THIS POINT
WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING I WOULD RECOMMEND RIN BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW HIS PLAY STYLE AND PREFERENCES
IN QUEBEC CITY HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED YET THEY OFFER FREE SHIPPING FOR ORDERS JUST MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE THE ENGLISH VERSIONS IF FRENCH IS NOT YOUR THING
BOARDGAMEBLISS PRIMARILY I LIKE THAT THEY HAVE A REWARDS SYSTEM AND ARE PRETTY RESPONSIVE AND ACCOMMODATING FOR EXAMPLE I HAD SOME GAMES ON HOLD INCLUDING ONE FOR AN OUT-OF-TOWN CO-WORKER SAID CO-WORKER THEN PLACED AN ORDER OF HER OWN FOR SOME BROKEN TOKEN STUFF AND I SENT AN EMAIL ASKING THEY SHIP THE GAME I PAID FOR IN THAT ORDER AND THEY DID IT MY CO-WORKER WAS SUPER CONFUSED WHEN THE GAME SHOWED UP BUT HER AND HER HUSBAND WERE VERY HAPPY AND QUITE IMPRESSED THAT THEY'D BE WILLING TO DO THAT AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF SEVERAL LITTLE POSITIVE THINGS I COULD SAY ABOUT BBB

QUICHE GAMES IS ALSO REALLY GOOD AND THEY'LL USUALLY BUT THEIR STOCK SEEMS LOW COMPARATIVELY THEY ALSO BUMPED THEIR FREE SHIPPING THRESHOLD UP FROM TO PUTTING THE MARGIN OF ADVANTAGE OVER BBB AND OTHERS THAT MUCH LOWER I ALSO LIKE MEEPLEMART AND SOMETIMES GREAT BOARDGAMES AND I'VE ORDERED FROM WOOD FOR SHEEP AND STARLIT CITADEL BEFORE

I HAVE ORDERED FROM AMAZON TOO BUT NOT VERY MUCH THEIR PRICES ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE FOR SUCH A BIG COMPANY BUT THEY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE IN THAT THERE IS A REALLY GOOD RETURN POLICY FOR VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING WITHIN REASON ANYHOW

YOU CAN CHECK AT SCROLL DOWN THE CANADIAN FLAGS TO COMPARE PRICES AND STOCK BETWEEN RETAILERS TOO THEY DON'T LIST EVERYONE ALL THE TIME THOUGH SO IT PAYS TO COMPARE MANUALLY WITH THE ONES NOT LISTED
ALL OF THE BELOW OPTIONS HAVE CHEAP SHIPPING WITHIN A DOLLAR OF EACH OTHER

IS REALLY THE SPOT FOR ME EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND GREAT SELECTION ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THEY OFFER REALLY COMPETITIVE SHIPPING TO THE US SO ANY GAMES GO JUST THAT MUCH FASTER GREAT FOR THE STORE BAD FOR MY CHANCES OF GETTING A HOT NEW TITLE

IS GREAT WITH THE SELECTIONS AND EASY TO NAVIGATE WEBSITE LOTS OF GOOD AVAILABLE AND SHIPPING IS FAST DOWNSIDE IS CUSTOMER SERVICE IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR SHIPMENT YOU JUST MAY BE SOOL READ THE FINE PRINT IN THEIR SHIPPING RETURN POLICY THEY TAKE REALLY GOOD CARE OF SHIPPING THEIR PACKAGES THOUGH SO ITS USUALLY NOT A PROBLEM ONLY HAD ONE INCIDENT AND THE GAME COMPANY TOOK CARE OF IT ANYWAY ORDERED SINCE SEVERAL TIMES WITHOUT PROBLEM

MEEPLEMART MAY HAVE THE BEST HIDDEN SALES IN CANADA BUT THEIR WEBSITE IS DIFFICULT TO MANAGE STILL ALWAYS WORTH KEEPING AN EYE ON THEIR SALES PAGE EVERY SO OFTEN I GOT MERCHANTS OF VENUS NIS A WHILE AGO FOR AND ROBINSON CRUSOE VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE FOR AND THEY HAVE HAD OTHER CRAZY SALES SINCE IT NEVER SEEMS TO BE ADVERTISED THOUGH

QUICHE HAS A VEERY NICE WEBSITE BUT SELECTIONS AND VOLUME IS PRETTY LACKING THEY ALSO SEEM TO BE PRETTY SLOW AT BRINGING IN NEW TITLES STILL THEIR PRICES ARE COMPETITIVE SO ITS WORTH KEEPING AN EYE ON THEM

GREATBOARDGAMES WEBSITE IS DATED BUT THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD SELECTION AND COMPETITIVE PRICES I HAVE HAD GOOD LUCK FINDING GAMES THAT ARE SOLD OUT EVERYWHERE ELSE HERE THEY MAY HAVE THE BEST WAREHOUSE IN CANADA NEXT TO BOARDGAMEBLISS BUT THEY ARE OFTEN OVER LOOKED SO YOU CAN EASILY STRIKE GOLD HERE


ALSO DO NOT BE SO QUICK TO DISMISS THEY HAVE SOME OF THE BEST DEALS IN CANADA BUT THEY ARE RARE AND NEVER ADVERTISED AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THEY WILL QUIETLY START RELEASING SOME HOT TITLES ON THERE DEAL OF THE DAY SECTION STARTING SOMETIME SOON SO START CHECKING IN ON IT EVERY MORNING I GOT ARMADA AND IMPERIAL ASSAULT FOR EACH LAST YEAR


I HAVE FOUND LOTS OF ONLINE STORES THAT ARE LOCAL TO ME THAT HAVE VERY GOOD PRICES DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE YOU MAY HAVE A FEW TOO AND THEN YOU CAN SAVE ON SHIPPING

BEST OF LUCK
QUICHEGAMES AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE
I ENJOY THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE WELL BY ME AND SEEM TO HAVE GOOD SELECTION AND PRICES
BOARDGAMEBLISS AND MOST RECENTLY APTTOGAME
IF YOU'RE IN LONDON AREA JASON DOES FREE DELIVERY FOR GEEKSTOP GAMES OTHERWISE WHATEVER IS THE BEST LISTED ON
THE ONLY ONE I'VE USED THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN MENTIONED YET IS

THE VAST MAJORITY I BUY FROM GAMES THOUGH THEY'RE PRETTY CONSISTENTLY THE CHEAPEST FOR MOST THINGS SO USUALLY I BUY FROM OTHER PLACES ONLY IF THEY DON'T HAVE WHAT I WANT
I USE A VARIETY OF SHOPS IN THE GTA AND EVEN IF I BUY ONLINE I MOSTLY ARRANGE

BOARDGAMEBLISS I LIVE LESS THAN A MIN DRIVE AWAY SO I CAN SHOP ONLINE THEN PICK UP ORDERS I DO MOST OF MY GAME PURCHASES THROUGH THEM GREAT SERVICE
ONLY USE THE BIG GUY WHEN THEY HAVE STEEP DISCOUNTS OR DEALS OF THE DAY

IT CAN DEPEND ON WHERE YOU ARE BUT IN GENERAL I WOULD SAY THAT HAS BEEN MY GOTO ONLINE STORE FOR THEIR SELECTION IMPORTS PRICING RESPONSIVENESS AND QUICK SHIPPING

HAVING SAID THAT

I LIVE IN THE KITCHENER WATERLOO REGION AND THESE GUYS OFFER FREE PICKUP MOST SATURDAYS NOW SO I HAVE STARTED ORDERING HERE WHEN THEY HAVE WHAT I WANT

I HAVE FAMILY IN BURLINGTON AND THESE GUYS HAVE SOME GREAT DEALS SALES AND OFFER FLEXIBLE PICKUP
I REALLY LIKE HETP AND THINK THEY HAVE GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SO I TRY TO ORDER FROM THERE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

WHEN BOARDGAMEBLISS DOESN'T HAVE WHAT I NEED IN STOCK GAMES HETP

OR WHEN I HAVE TO LIKE YOU SAID SOMETIMES IT ENDS UP BEING CHEAPER THAN EVEN WITH THE CONVERSION AND SHIPPING
I'M JUST GOING TO MENTION A COUPLE NOT ALREADY MENTIONED BY U SHINEUPONTHEE

IS A TORONTO STORE HAS GOOD PRICES AND A DECENT SELECTION SELECTION ISN'T USUALLY QUITE AS GOOD AS BOARDGAMEBLISS BUT FOR THE THINGS THEY DO HAVE YOU'LL OFTEN FIND THAT THEIR PRICES ARE BETTER ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES THE PRICE IS WORSE TOO IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH SHOPPING AROUND ALSO HAS A BETTER FREE SHIPPING THRESHOLD THAN BOARDGAMEBLISS
APT TO GAME IS A NEWER COMPANY FROM RURAL ALBERTA SOON MOVING TO EDMONTON THEIR SELECTION ISN'T AS GOOD AS OR BOARDGAMEBLISS BUT THEY'RE SLOWLY IMPROVING AND HAVE SIMILAR PRICING THEIR SHIPPING THRESHOLD IS ALSO LOWER AT JUST SO IT'S WORTH CHECKING THEIR WEBSITE OUT TOO
THIS WAS ASKED NOT TOO LONG AGO AND WHILE I HAVEN'T ORDERED ANYTHING YET FROM THIS SITE THEY HAVE COMPARABLE PRICES FREE SHIPPING REGARDLESS OF BOX AND SOME PRETTY BAD ASS LISTS


TIPS ASIDE FROM BOARDGAMEPRICES THERE ISN'T MUCH ELSE TO DO SALES ARE PRETTY INFREQUENT THERE IS THE ODD DING AND DENT DEAL IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT

I ALSO USE CERVALET AND GEEKSTOPGAMES AS WELL IN ADDITION TO THOSE LISTED
I LIVE A MINUTE WALK FROM THEM SO I USUALLY GO THERE

OTHERWISE WHEN THEN HAVE DEALS BUT REALLY WITH SHIPPING IT WORKS OUT TO JUST BE BETTER FOR ME TO PICK UP FROM A STORE
AMAZON DOES HAVE GOOD DEALS IF THE GAME IS IN STOCK IF YOU'RE BUYING SOMETHING THAT ONLY HAS 2 COPIES LEFT AND THEY ARE MARKING IT UP THEN IT'S GOING TO BE OVER RETAIL I ALWAYS CHECK BEFORE BUYING

I'VE BOUGHT FROM QUICHE OR












IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU'RE SHIPPING TO THESE STORES ARE BASED ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SHIPPING WILL BE LESS IF YOU CAN SHIP LOCAL
MY ORDER OF PREFERENCE



I HAVE BEEN SHOPPING THERE FOR YEARS ANYONE REMEMBER WHEN THEY WERE CALLED GERMAN GAMES USUALLY A FEW BUCKS CHEAPER THAN THE OTHERS

BOARDGAMEBLISS

PLACED MY FIRST ORDER WITH THEM ON MONDAY AND IT SHIPPED TUESDAY TRIED THEM BECAUSE THEY HAD COTTAGE GARDEN AND GREAT BOARDGAMES DIDN'T THE POINTS THING IS NEAT I LIKE THAT CERTAIN GAMES WILL QUALIFY YOU FOR FREE SHIPPING

GAMES

NICE SELECTION BUT HAVEN'T BOUGHT FROM THEM PERSONALLY BUT MANY IN MY GROUP HAVE
I'M SOUTH OF VANCOUVER NORTH OF THE US BORDER US MAILBOX SERVICES IN BLAINE WA ARE A BIG THING HERE THEY'LL PROCESS AND HOLD PACKAGES FOR YOU FOR EACH ADD IN A NEXUS CARD AND EVEN WITH THE EXCHANGE RATE CROSS BORDER SHOPPING CAN HAVE SOME GOOD DEALS
I HAVE USED BOARDGAMEBLISS AND STARLIT CITADEL

ALSO CHECK OUT CANADIAN SITES ARE LOWER DOWN THE RESULT PAGE

WHEN I STARTED BUYING I USED AMAZON HAVING FOUND BOARDGAMEBLISS AND I REGRET THE EXTRA MONEY WASTED
I USED TO USE BOARDGAMEBLISS BECAUSE THEY ALLOW YOU TO HOLD ORDERS UNTIL EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO BUY COMES IN THEIR COMMUNICATION IS VERY GOOD AS WELL BUT DON'T BE DUPED BY THEIR REWARD SYSTEM IT SOUNDS GOOD BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT EVEN IF YOU MAX OUT THE IT ONLY WORKS OUT TO A DISCOUNT IF YOU CAN FIND GAMES FOR BETTER PRICES ON OTHER SITES YOU SHOULD BUY LOWER PRICES AND NOT EVENTUAL SMALL DISCOUNT

I'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH BOARDGAMEBLISS RECENTLY AND I FIND IT MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH TO SEND EMAILS BACK AND FORTH TIMES FOR A DISCOUNT

I'VE SWITCHED TO FOR THEIR FREE SHIPPING AT AND FAIRLY GOOD SELECTION IT'S NOT PERFECT THOUGH THEY DON'T OFFICIALLY ALLOW YOU TO HOLD ORDERS AND THEIR SELECTION IS GENERALLY GOOD BUT BLISS SEEMS TO HAVE EVERYTHING EAST G BIOS GENESIS NEVER CAME IN AT DALE OF MERCHANTS NEVER CAME IN BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ALL RELEASES IS GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN MAKE SMALLER ORDERS FOR FREE SHIPPING AND SEEM TO BE SAME PRICE OR CHEAPER THAN BLISS FIVE DRIVES FOR EXAMPLE IS QUITE A BIT CHEAPER WHICH IS BETTER THAN IN MANY CASES HAS ALSO GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHEN IT COMES TO FIXING PROBLEMS NO LONG BACK AND FORTH THEY ARE DIRECT AND OFFER TO FIX THE PROBLEM THEY HAVE WON MY LOYALTY THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS

GREATBOARDGAMES IS A PLACE I ORDERED FROM ONCE BUT THEY SCREWED UP THE ORDER OUT OF STOCK ON AN ITEM I ORDERED AND NEEDED FOR A GIFT AND WOULDN'T COMMUNICATE EXCEPT WITH A SORRY A LITTLE FRUSTRATING AND I HAVEN'T USED THEM SINCE


I'M IN TECHNICALLY CANADA QUEBEC WELL MONTREAL SO I'M LUCKY THERE ARE GOOD FAGS AROUND
I'VE ORDERED FROM AND I'VE HAD VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH BOTH GREAT SERVICE AND DECENT PRICES
I'VE USED BOARDGAMEBLISS AND AMAZON HAD GREAT EXPERIENCES WITH BOTH

THIS THREAD HAS A TON OF OTHER SITES THAT I WILL DEFINITELY CHECK OUT

ALWAYS SHOP AROUND BUT IT'S ALWAYS WORTH GOING TO YOUR AGS AND ASKING IF THEY WILL MATCH AN ONLINE PRICE PRICE SHIPPING IT NEVER HURTS TO ASK AND IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO SHOP LOCAL AND SUPPORT YOUR TABLETOP COMMUNITY

MISSION FUN AND GAMES HETP

STARLIT CITADEL HETP
HERE IS A LIST OF BOARD GAMES WITH ACTION MOVEMENT PROGRAMMING



WHILE NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD LOOK FOR THESE ARE ALL GAMES IN WHICH A PLAYER LEARNS SETTING UP ACTIONS AND EXECUTING THEM
IT MIGHT BE MORE HELP IF YOU COULD GIVE A BRIEF EXAMPLE OF EACH PRINCIPAL THAT YOU WANT TO TEACH AND HOW IT WOULD WORK IN THE REAL WORLD AND THEN SOME PEOPLE WOULD HELP THROW OUT SOME GAME MECHANICS IDEAS THAT FIT THAT PRINCIPAL I THINK TRYING TO START WITH GAMES THAT WE LIKE WHICH MIGHT FIT YOUR PRINCIPALS IS THE WRONG WAY TO DO THIS

ITS BEEN A WHILE SINCE MY SWENGINEERING CLASS AND ALL I REALLY REMEMBER IS HOW TO DRAW PRETTY DIAGRAMS WITH VISIE

ALSO ITS TOTALLY FINE TO HAVE SOME FUN AND LEARN ABOUT BOARD GAMES THATS AWESOME ITS A REALLY COOL HOBBY THAT WILL PROBABLY APPEAL TO A LOT OF THINGS YOU LIKE AS A COMP SCI MAJOR BUT DONT LOSE FOCUS OF THE ASSIGNMENT HERE I HIGHLY DOUBT YOUR PROF IS LOOKING FOR AN ACTUALLY FUN TO PLAY REAL WORLD BOARD GAME ITS JUST A MORE CASUAL WAY TO DISPLAY SOME CONCEPTS FOR INSTANCE YOU WONT LOSE POINTS FOR THE GAME BEING LAME YOU WILL LOSE POINTS FOR BARELY TOUCHING ON THE PRINCIPALS S HE WANTS TO HIGHLIGHT OR BEING SUPER DUPER ABSTRACT AND DISTANT ABOUT WHAT THE PRINCIPALS ARE

WOW IF I HAVE NIGHTS A WEEK TO GAME I'D BE SUPER HAPPY
FRIDAY ISN'T BAD
SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE
IM KIND OF IN YOUR SITUATION AS WELL AND HAVE TURNED TO TRYING OUT SOLO GAMES BUT I DO SO WITH THE HELP OF TABLETOP SIMULATOR I WOULD GATHER A LIST OF SOLO GAMES OR GAMES THAT ARE GOOD TO SOLO AND DOWNLOAD THE MOD IF AVAILABLE FOR TTS AND GIVE THEM A TRY MANY I'VE PLAYED ONCE OR TWICE AND FOUND I DIDN'T ENJOY THEM ENOUGH OTHERS WERE GREAT AND I DECIDED TO BUY THEM MAYBE THIS COULD WORK FOR YOU


SOME GAMES I'VE AND LIKED HAVE BEEN


LEAVING EARTH RUN YOUR OWN SPACE PROGRAM AND SEND ROCKETS INTO SPACE ACHIEVING VARIOUS MISSION OBJECTIVES AS A SPACE GUY I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME


KNIERIM IT WAS OKAY VERY LIGHT NOT TOO CHALLENGING FOR THE BASE GAME BUT WITH THE EXPANSIONS IT GETS DIFFICULT VERY QUICKLY


PANDEMIC SURPRISINGLY GOOD AS A SOLO GAME

MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME VERY COOL BUT I PERSONALLY WOULD ENJOY IT WILL OTHERS JUT STILL VERY FUN AND FUNCTIONAL

FRIDAY ONCE YOU SOLVE THE STRATEGY TO BEAT IT YOU MAY GET OVER THIS ONE I HAVE OWNED IT FOR A YEAR OR SO NOW AND PLAY IT CASUALLY AND I'VE YET TO SOLVE IT I STILL HAVE FUN WITH IT






IT REALLY DEPENDS WHAT YOU ARE IN TO WITH GAMES YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THE UNIVERSE GAMES KNIERIM SYLVIAN CASTELLATION AND ABOUT TO BE RELEASED NAUTILICONE THEY ARE ALL GREAT LITTLE GAMES AND ARE DECEIVING IN THEIR DEPTH

I LOVE DICE GAMES SO RUN FIGHT OR DIE DEEP APACE D AND PANDEMIC THE CURE ARE GREAT SHORTER ONES FOR ME
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN GAMING FOR I'D SUGGEST NOT BURNING YOURSELF OUT TOO FAST BECAUSE THERE COMES A POINT WHERE IT'S HARD ENOUGH KEEPING UP WITH RULES ETC

BUT YOU DIDN'T READ THIS COMMENT FOR MY ADVICE YOU WANTED A GAME I'D SUGGEST MAGE KNIGHT OR STAR TREK FRONTIERS IF YOU PREFER A SCI-FI THEME ALMOST EVERY CO-OP GAME OUT THERE WORKS AS WELL AS A SOLO GAME I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T PLAYED THEM BUT I'VE HEARD THAT TERRAFORMING MARS BASEBALL HIGHLIGHTS SCYTHE AND THE NETWORKS ALL HAVE SOLID SINGLE PLAYER MODES AS WELL
I'VE BEEN PLAYING SOLO A LOT LATELY AND I WOULD RECOMMEND LORD OF THE RINGS CG SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL PLAYS VERY QUICKLY MICE MYSTICS AND ELDRITCH HORROR

EDIT ALSO ZOMBICIDE CAN BE FUN FOR SOLO PLAY
I'D START WITH COOPS IN PARTICULAR PANDEMIC THE CURE AND PLAY AS PAWNS BEFORE YOU LAUGH I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKED IT AS A SOLO GAME MUCH MORE SO THAN WITH OTHER PLAYERS IT SATISFIES THE DICE CHUCKING URGE I GET PERIODICALLY AND KEEPS YOU INTERESTED FOR THE ENTIRE OR MINUTES IT TAKES TO EITHER WIN OR LOSE ON A LARGER SCALE BURGLE BROS WOULD HAVE POTENTIAL AS A SOLVABLE COOP ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE HARDER SCENARIOS UPGRADE TO EPIC SCALE AND DOING ELDRITCH HORROR TAKES LIKE ISH HOURS BUT THAT'S ANOTHER THAT I'VE THOUGHT WAS PRETTY GOOD AS A SOLO GAME

FOR WARGAMES TAKE A LOOK AT JOHN D-DAY SERIES EAST G D-DAY AT OMAHA BEACH OR THE SEQUEL IN THE PACIFIC WHICH ESCAPES MY BRAIN AT THE MOMENT THEY ARE SOLO ONLY AND ARE REALLY WELL REGARDED IN PARTICULAR OMAHA SOME OF THE GMT COIN SERIES AREN'T BAD A SOLO GAMES BUT YOU HAVE TO BE MORE INVESTED IN THE CONFLICT TO SLOG THROUGH THE SOLO RULES AND BOT CHARTS AND STUFF THOSE ARE GAMES WHERE YOU BUY THE GAME AND TAKE A GINGERLY STROLL THROUGH IT OVER THE COURSE OF A MONTH OF STUDY BETWEEN THE RULES THE BACKGROUND ETC I'VE FIRE IN THE LAKE BUT I REALLY DIG THE GAME AND TIME PERIOD I HAVE A FRIEND WHO PLAYS LABYRINTH THE WAR ON TERROR SOLO AND HE LIKES IT BUT I NEVER TRIED IT SO I DON'T KNOW WARGAMES ALMOST NECESSITATE A WARGAME TABLE WHICH YOU CAN LEAVE THE GAME SETUP FOR A FEW WEEKS ON AND PLAY IT A LITTLE BIT EACH DAY OR TWO

ON THE EURO FRONT I ENJOYED CAVERN SOLO BUT IT DOESN'T HOLD UP AFTER OR PLAYS ONE OF THE OTHER UWE FARMING GAMES LIKE A FEAST FOR ODIN OR FIELDS OF ARLE ARE PROBABLY BETTER CHOICES IN PARTICULAR THE FORMER SINCE IT HAS THE OCCASIONAL DIE ROLL AND CARD DRAWING TO CHANGE IT UP MY SOLO EURO OF CHOICE IS ROADS BOATS WHICH IS ARGUABLY BEST AT AND I PERSONALLY SORT OF SWEAR BY IT AT THAT COUNT LEWIS CLARK WAS ACTUALLY OK AS A SOLO GAME
LEAVING EARTH
ALL THESE ARE GOOD AS SOLO WITH GREAT REPLAYABALITY
AT THE GATES OF LOYANG PURE OPTIMIZATION PUZZLE
THE CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THE CARD GAME IT HAS GOOD SOLO MODE
EVEN THOUGH IT IS GAME IT IS GOOD AS SOLO GAME
ELDER SIGN UNSEEN FORCES YAHTZEE STYLE WITH PASTED CTHULHU THEME
ELDRITCH HORROR FORSAKEN LORE
FIVE TRIBES HAS OFFICIAL SOLO VARIANT
GHOST STORIES HARD AND UNFORGIVING
IMPERIAL SETTLERS SOLO MODE IS GOOD NOT GREAT BUT THERE IS OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN MODE I HAVEN'T TRIED
LEGENDS OF ANDOR EURO STYLE PUZZLE PUT INTO FANTASY WORLD
LEWIS CLARK I LIKE IT'S SOLO MODE YOU ARE TRYING TO BEAT A CLOCK NEUTRAL PLAYER THAT MOVES ONE PLACE A HEAD EVERY TURN
LIMES FAIRLY ABSTRACT CARCASSONNE TYPE OF GAME BINGO STYLE FOR 2 PLAYERS THAT CAN BE PLAYED SOLO BIT YOUR SCORE INSTEAD OF OPPONENT'S
PANDEMIC
ROBINSON CRUSOE ADVENTURES ON THE CURSED ISLAND HIGHLY THEMATIC AND HARD GAME
SAMURAI SPIRIT
SNOWDONIA GREAT SOLO MODE AGAINST THE NEUTRAL COMPANY THAT ACTS AS A TIMER FOR THE GAME PROGRESS
SINCE NO ONE HAS LINKED IT YET HERE ARE THE TOP SOLO GAMES AS VOTED ON BY THE PLAYER GUILD ON BG PEOPLE'S CHOICE TOP SOLO GAMES
CAVERN WAS FUN BY ITSELF THE TIME I DID IT
GMT GAMES HAS A ENTIRE SOLVABILITY RATING ON ALL THEIR GAMES STUFF LIKE FIRE IN THE LAKE OR CHURCHILL WILL DO
SAMURAI SPIRIT IS A P GAME WHERE YOU PLAY AS MIDDLE AGED CURRIES SAVING THE WORLD THROUGH THE POWER OF BLACKJACK MECHANICS

SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL IS A P DUNGEON CRAWL THAT PLAYS EXACTLY LIKE THE MOVIE ALIENS

ANY OF THE PANDEMIC SERIES FROM CTHULHU TO VANILLA TO THE CURE ALL PLAY VERY WELL WITH TWO PAWNS CONTROLLED BY ONE GUY
THESE ARE ALL GREAT SUGGESTIONS BUT WHAT KIND OF GAMES DO YOU LIKE GIVE US A TOP IT'S EASIER THAT WAY
THE ANSWER IS KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER THAT IS ALL
I PLAY A LOT OF SOLO AND WITH A JOB AND KIDS I FIND IT TOUGH TO HAVE THE ENERGY TO PLAY OR NIGHTS A WEEK WITH MAYBE ONE NIGHT A GAME WITH THE WIFE AND A GROUP WHICH MEETS MAYBE EVERY WEEKS

THAT SAID AND THESE ARE ALL SUBJECT TO PERSONAL TASTE

FIELDS OF ARLE AGRICOLA A FEAST FOR ODIN TERRAFORMING MARS LATEST OBSESSION LA GANJA SILENT VICTORY ELDRITCH HORROR NEANDERTHAL LE HAVRE VITICULTULTURE AND SUBURBIA ARE ALL GAMES I HAVE HAD GOOD TIMES PLAYING SOLO THEY'RE ALL GOOD GAMES TOO IMO AND BASED ON GENERAL CONSENSUS
IT'S OK TO HAVE OTHER HOBBIES
ALMOST ALL OF THE LOVECRAFTIAN LORE GAMES ARE GOOD FOR SOLO PLAYS AS ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE CO-OP AND DRIPPING WITH LORE

MARKHAM HORROR
MARKHAM HORROR CG
ELDRITCH HORROR
ELDER SIGN
MANSIONS OF MADNESS
PANDEMIC CTHULHU

DUNGEON CRAWL DUDES ON MAP GAMES THAT ARE GOOD SOLO

GEARS OF WAR
IND ADVENTURE SYSTEMS
DESCENT APP
STAR WARS AUTOMATED AI GET IT ON BG

OTHER NOTABLE MENTIONS

IMPERIAL SETTLERS SOLO CAMPAIGN BG
APOCALYPSE CHAOS
SCYTHE HAS SOME PRETTY GOOD SOLO GAME RULES WHILE I HAVE ONLY PLAYED IT SOLO ONCE IT WAS A BIT CHALLENGING BUT WELL WORTH IT
A GOOD START
ELDRITCH HORROR OR SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE
I'VE HEARD THAT NAVAJO WARS IS GOOD BUT I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT WAITING ON THE GMT FOR IT
ELDER SIGNS OMENS THE PHONE VERSION

IT'S DESIGNED FROM THE START AS SOLITAIRE AND IT'S VERY CHALLENGING IT FEELS A LITTLE AT TIMES BUT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO INFLUENCE THE ODDS
I'M SO RICH BUT I WANT A LITTLE MORE I'M HAPPY IF I CAN ROPE SOMEBODY INTO PLAYING ONCE A MONTH
FRIDAY
I'M GETTING DESCENT WITH THE APP TO TRY SOME SOLO GAMING HAVEN'T TRIED IT YET SO CAN'T SAY BUT I'VE READ GOOD THINGS
IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN RADIO RUNS THROUGH IT MANY GAMES PLAY FINE LIKE THAT IF YOU WANT TO TRY A MULTIPLAYER GAME WITH PERSON I'VE ONLY DONE IT A FEW TIMES TO LEARN A GAME BUT IT'S BEEN FUN ALL THE SAME
I THINK AT THIS POINT VIDEO GAMES AND BOARD GAME APPS ARE PROBABLY YOUR BEST BET TO ME PHYSICAL BOARD GAMES JUST DON'T LEND THEMSELVES NEARLY AS WELL TO SOLO GAMEPLAY AS DIGITAL MEDIUMS DO

CIVILIZATION TURN BASED EMPIRE BUILDING AT ITS BEST

ATLAS REACTOR MY CURRENT OBSESSION FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE A BOARD GAME IMO

ORCS MUST DIE TOWER DEFENSE GAME THIS GENRE HAS LEAKED INTO BOARD GAMES BECAUSE THERE'S A SIMILAR SATISFACTION

DARK SOULS THIS ONE IS MUCH LESS SIMILAR TO BOARD GAMES THAN MY OTHER SUGGESTIONS HOWEVER THE WAY THIS GAME FORCES YOU TO LEARN AND ITERATE IS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FOR MANY SOLO BOARD GAMES
BCOM THE BOARD GAME CAN BE A ONE PLAYER GAME YOU PLAY AGAINST THE AI APP ON YOUR PHONE OR TABLET IT'S A REALLY FUN GAME ACTUALLY AND WORKS FOR PLAYERS
MY SOLOS AT THE MOMENT ARE STAR TREK FRONTIERS FRIDAY DOMINION MEMOIR LEGENDS OF ANDOR

ONE THING THAT'S GETTING ME IS THAT I ACCIDENTALLY AMASSED A BUNCH OF DECKBUILDERS FOR SOLO PLAY AND IF I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING THAT I'M SHORT ON OPTIONS SO MAKE SURE YOU GET A VARIETY OF CORE MECHANICS AND TRY TO REDUCE OVERLAP
HEAVY MAGE KNIGHT IS KING THE COIN GAMES FROM GMT ARE ALSO GREAT MY FAVORITE IS FALLING SKY

LIGHT SHORT SYLVIAN CASTELLATION DEEP SPACE D AND PANDEMIC THE CURE ARE ALL SOLID

I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN REALLY ENJOYING A COUPLE GAMES WITH LOONEY PYRAMIDS FROM PYRAMID ARCADE LATELY SPECIFICALLY COLOR WHEEL AND SOLOMIDS THE LATTER BEING MY FAVORITE THEY'RE JUST STRAIGHTFORWARD PUZZLES BUT THEY'RE QUITE SATISFYING AND SURPRISINGLY ENGAGING
I'VE GOT TO SAY DESCENT JOURNEYS INTO DARKNESS PAIRED WITH THE ROAD TO LEGEND APPARENTLY

ITS A CRAZY COOL INNOVATION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL IT WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO BUY MORE AND MORE EXPANSIONS ALSO YOU MIGHT END UP PICKING UP ANOTHER HOBBY MINI PAINTING

CAN'T RECOMMEND IT STRONGLY ENOUGH IF YOU LIKE FANTASY
I JUST ACQUIRED VAST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I'M ANXIOUSLY AWAITING ITS DEBUT ON THE TABLE THE UPGRADE PACK SEEMS VERY REASONABLE FOR PREVIOUS BACKERS TOO
SO I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS GAME WHEN IT CAME OUT AND THEN POOF IT WAS GONE I'M HAPPY THERE'S ANOTHER CRACK AT IT WITH SOME LESSONS LEARNED INCLUDED

THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME CONFUSION AROUND PRICING AND I'M HONESTLY HOPING THE CREATOR IS REASONABLE ABOUT IT IF I'M PAYING AFTER SHIPPING FOR A GAME I REALLY HOPE THAT INCLUDES THE STRETCH GOAL A STRETCH GOAL BY DEFINITION SHOULD BE SOMETHING INCLUDED FOR EVERYONE WHO BUYS THE GAME THE PRICE IS PRETTY STEEP AS IT IS AND I HOPE THAT NO ONE IS GOING TO TRY AND GET MORE MONEY OUT OF BACKERS FOR SOMETHING THAT I CONSIDER ALREADY PAID FOR

ALL THAT SAID I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE GAME I HOPE THE BUSINESS PART OF IT GETS SORTED OUT
I AM REALLY THINKING ABOUT GETTING A COPY OF THIS BUT I WANT TO KNOW IF PEOPLE THINK IT IS REPAYABLE ENOUGH FOR PLUS TAX HONESTLY CURIOUS NOT TRYING TO BE NEGATIVE OR ANYTHING

THANKS
I FEEL LIKE MY WIFE AND I WOULD LOVE THIS BUT GETTING ANYONE ELSE IN WOULD BE HARD HOW DOES IT PLAY WITH 2
WAIT I HAD PLACED AN ORDER FOR THE SECOND PRINTING ON THE CREATOR'S WEBSITE DOES THIS MEAN THOSE PREORDER ARE OUT THE WINDOW
AWESOME THIS IS ONE THAT I REGRETTED NOT PICKING UP AT GC GLAD IT GOT A 2ND PRINTING SO I CAN SNAG ONE
UGH DAMN YOU I JUST BACKED
UPGRADE PLEDGE MINIS
THANKS FOR THE NOTICE I'VE BEEN HOPING FOR A 2ND PRINTING AND MARCH ISN'T THAT FAR AWAY
SEEMINGLY NO WAY FOR FIRST EDITION BACKERS TO GET THAT SIXTH PLAYER WHICH IS SUPER DISAPPOINTING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE GAME THOUGH VERY FUN
I JUST LOVE THE CONCEPT OF THIS GAME SO MUCH THINK THE MINIATURES ARE REALLY WHAT THE GAME WAS MISSING FIRST TIME AROUND IT SEEMS TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCES FEEL MORE APPARENT IMMEDIATE GREAT TO SEE A 2ND RUN GOT TO GET SOME EXTRA CASH TO PUT ON THIS IF I CAN
QUESTION FOR ALL IS THIS A GAME THAT CASUAL BOARDGAMERS WILL LIKE TO PLAY FROM WHAT I HEAR THE GAMEPLAY IS FUN BUT KEEPING TRACK OF ALL THE DIFFERENT RULES SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING ONLY REGULAR GAMERS WILL ENJOY
SO I'VE GOT A QUESTION WHEN I BOUGHT THIS AT GEN CON IT CAME WITH ALL THESE GREAT WOODEN PIECES WELL THE CAVE HAS PURPLE SQUARES AND I CAN NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE FOR
I ORDERED THE 1ST ED OFF THE SITE AFTER DEMING IT AT GENION AND JUST BACKED THE OFF KS EXCITED I LOVE THE ARTWORK AND ASYMMETRY OF THIS GAME
MORE STRETCH GOALS TO COME I HOPE WILL ACTUALLY PROBABLY TAKE THE KICKSTARTER PLUNGE AND GET THIS
GOP ALL TOLD FOR THE GAME MINIATURES AND SHIPPING TO UK THAT'S BEFORE THE GHOST GETS COSTED AS AN ADD ON JEEEEEEEEESUS

YOU HAVE TO REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF THE GAME TO SHELL OUT WHAT WILL BE APPROACHING GOING TO HAVE TO PASS ON THE MINIATURES TO GET IT NEARER A SHAME BUT PROBABLY PUTS IT IN THE BALL PARK OF WORTH IT FOR SUCH A UNIQUE GAME AT THAT POINT FOR ME IT JUST COMES DOWN TO THE PRICE OF ANY ADCONS
INTERESTING TO SEE THE SECOND PRINT RUNNING GET A KS I PASSED ON IT FIRST TIME ROUND BUT HAVING SEEN SUCH POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND AS A WANNABE DESIGNER I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING I NEED TO PICK UP
ANOTHER KS NOT DEALING PROPERLY WITH SHIPPING OUTSIDE THE US AGAIN

BUCKS FOR THE WHOLE GAME OF THIS SIZE PASSIVE
HMM ANYONE KNOW IF THE UPGRADE KITS AND MINIS WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER THE KS ENDS AND OR AT RETAIL THIS IS A TERRIBLE TIME TO RUN A KICKSTARTER IMO WITH THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND ALL
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA ON HOW TO GET THE GHOST AND THE PRICE OF THE ABDON PACK WILL IT COME WITH BOTH A STANDEE AND A STEEPLE LIKE THE OTHER COMPONENTS WILL THE GHOST GET ITS OWN SINGLE SHEET RULES CHEAT LIKE THE OTHER ROLES

WILL THE 2ND PRINT SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY BEYOND KS IS STEEP REALLY KICKING MYSELF FOR WAITING UNTIL THE LAST DAY TO BUY THIS AT GENION
IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME THE MINIS WON'T BE PAINTED
I'M GUESSING THAT UPGRADE PACK IS ONLY FOR 1ST EDITION OWNERS AND THE 2ND EDITION WILL HAVE THE UPGRADED RULES AND PLAYER BOARDS INCLUDED FIGURING OUT HOW TO PURCHASE THIS GAME IS GETTING A LITTLE COMPLICATED
TWO STARTERS IN ONE YEAR THAT'S MAD

I WAS INTERESTED IN THIS UNTIL I HEARD THE ENDING PLAYS OUT LIKE MUNCHKIN CAN ANYONE AGREE OR DISAGREE
DELETED
ARE THEY MAKING IT LOOK ANY BETTER IN THE SECOND PRINTING OR IS THE UGLY PURPLE AND CLUTTERED ICONOGRAPHY ON THE CAVE YIKES STILL THERE
I OWN DESCENT AND PLAYED A COUPLE OF GAMES OF CONAN OVER THE WEEKEND I ENJOYED BOTH BUT HERE'S THE PROS AND CONS IN MY HUMBLE OPINION

DESCENT

PROS

HUGE REPLACEABILITY DUE TO SCENARIOS MAPS AND HERO SELECTION
GOOD VARIETY OF SKILLS AND MECHANICS FOR CHARACTERS AND MINIONS ALIKE
CAMPAIGN IS REALLY WELL CONSTRUCTED
ENDLESSLY EXPANDABLE

CONS

CAN FEEL A LITTLE BUSY AT TIMES ESPECIALLY LATE IN THE CAMPAIGN WITH HUGE AMOUNTS GOING ON DUE TO EQUIPMENT AND SCENARIO MECHANICS
SOME SCENARIOS FEEL A LITTLE UNBALANCED
I FOUND THE LORE THEME A BIT GENERIC AND WEAK
MINIATURES AREN'T GREAT QUALITY

CONAN

PROS

OUTSTANDING MINIATURES
BATTLES AND GAMES FEEL ACTION PACKED
ACTION POINT SYSTEM OVERALL AND INITIATIVE ORDER SYSTEM FOR THE OVERLORD ARE REALLY WELL CRAFTED AND A BLAST TO PLAY
THEME AND LORE ARE REALLY GOOD

CONS

FEELS A LITTLE SIMPLER THAN THE DESCENT AND LESS CHARACTERS WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT REPLACEABILITY
NO CAMPAIGN ALTHOUGH THIS IS COMING SOON I HEAR
NOT AS MUCH MAP VARIETY DUE TO BEING BOARD BASED AS OPPOSED TO MODULAR

HOPE THIS HELPS AND BEAR IN MIND I'VE PLAYED ABOUT GAMES OF THE DESCENT AND ONLY TWO OF CONAN
I ONLY PLAYED DESCENT AND OWN ABOUT A OF ITS WHOLE CONTENTION

SINCE DESCENT AND IA ARE BOTH IN A SYSTEM WITH A DIFFERENT SKIN I'D RATHER PICK ANOTHER SYSTEM HOWEVER YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AGAIN IF YOU AREN'T COMFORTABLE WITH CERTAIN REVEALING MINIATURES WHICH I KNOW I AM BUT I'M SURE YOU DID SOME RESEARCH ABOUT THAT OR DON'T CARE FOR THE IP
DESCENT SEEMS LIKE THE GAME WHILE CONAN IS JUST HACK N SLASH BUT IT FEELS LIKE THE OPPOSITE AFTER YOU PLAY THEM DESCENT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING YOU CAN PLAY PRETTY CASUALLY LIKE A LIGHTER RPG WITHOUT ANY NEED FOR ROLE-PLAYING CONAN IS ALMOST LIKE A PUZZLE IN COMPARISON WHILE THERE IS RANDOMNESS DUE TO DICE BOTH SIDES HAVE TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT MOVEMENT AND HOW MUCH ENERGY THEY SHOULD SPEND IF YOU WASTE YOUR ENERGY THOUGHTLESSLY YOU WILL STRAIGHT UP LOSE THE GAME DUE TO HOW ENERGY CARRIES OVER THROUGH ROUNDS
GLOOMHAVEN
THERE AREN'T ANY GAMES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR IT THAT I KNOW OF BUT THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF GAMES THAT IT COULD BE DONE WITH BASICALLY ANYTHING WITHOUT HIDDEN KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE FINE ABSTRACT STRATEGY LIKE CHESS OR LIKE CARCASSONNE WILL WORK JUST FINE FOR THAT KIND OF THING
A GAME THAT YOU'LL NEED TO LEAVE OUT FOR SEVERAL DAYS HMM

ONLY ONE TITLE REALLY COMES TO MIND THE CAMPAIGN FOR NORTH AFRICA
I THINK DIPLOMACY WOULD BE INTERESTING LIKE THIS LIKE A WEEK LONG TRIP WITH FRIENDS WHERE A GAME OF DIPLOMACY IS GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND CONSTANTLY ANY TIME YOU ARE ALONE WITH SOMEONE YOU START PLOTTING DURING MEALS YOU TALK OF WAR ETC

IM PRETTY SURE THIS WOULD BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF LOSING FRIENDS FOREVER
THERE IS THE FREE ONLINE VERSION OF FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO BE PLAYED IN THIS FASHION BUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY PLAY A GAME OVER A FEW DAYS IF YOU CHOOSE
CHESS AND CHECKERS HAVE BOTH FIT THE BILL IN HOUSEHOLDS I'VE LIVED IN
YOU CAN PROBABLY PLAY MAGE KNIGHT THAT WAY

TWILIGHT STRUGGLE

WELL BASICALLY EVERY GAME WHERE YOUR TURNS CANNOT BE INTERFERED BY ANY OPPONENTS WHILE YOU ARE TAKING THE CAN BE PLAY THAT WAY
WHAT WE PLAN TO DO IS BUY A BUNCH OF SMALL MAGNETS AND GLUE THEM TO CARCASSONNE GAME PIECES AND USE A WHITE BOARD WITH METALLIC BACKING WHEN WE MOVE INTO OUR NEW HOUSE TO PLAY ON AND WRITE BASIC NOTES OBVIOUSLY BUYING A SECOND SET PURELY FOR THIS PLAN

TALUKA WOULD BE A GOOD OPTION TOO
DESIGNED NOT REALLY

GAMES THAT I DO THIS FOR MOST WARGAMES I PLAY SOLITAIRE
ABSTRACT STRATEGY IS A GOOD GENRE FOR THIS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'D RECOMMEND BLOCKUS FOR JUST YOU AND YOUR WIFE YOU MAY WANT TO DO THE TWO PLAYER TRAVEL EDITION
I THINK CARCASSONNE FITS THIS
PRETTY MUCH ANY GAME COULD DO THIS ALL YOU NEED IS A TURN MARKER TO SHOW WHO NEEDS TO PLAY NEXT
THROUGH THE AGES ONLINE SEEMS TO PLAY LIKE THAT
ANY GAME WHERE YOUR OPPONENT HAS LITERALLY ZERO AGENCY ON YOUR TURN FITS NO DICE ROLLING OR CARD PICKING OR ANYTHING TRADITIONALLY CHESS AND SCRABBLE ARE GOOD GAMES FOR THIS THEY BOTH HAVE NO AGENCY AND EACH TURN IS IMPACTFUL TO THE OVERALL GAME

THINKING OF MODERN GAMES CARCASSONNE SPRINGS TO MIND PRETTY QUICK TRURO WOULD BE A GOOD ONE TOO MAYBE HOKKAIDO BASICALLY THINK OF A GAME WHERE EACH TURN IS IMPACTFUL AND YOU NEVER HAVE TO CONSULT OPPONENTS FOR ACTIONS ON YOUR TURN
I THINK PATCHWORK WOULD WORK BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE PLAYED IT
IF YOU LOOK AT THEY HAVE A TON OF PLAY BY EMAIL GAMES AND SLIGHT CHANGES TO NORMAL GAMES RULES TO MAKE THAT WORK GREAT I ESPECIALLY THINK THEIR RUSSIAN ROADS AND CASTLES OF BURGUNDY IMPLEMENTATIONS WORK OUT FANTASTICALLY YOU COULD PLAY COB WITH THOSE CHANGES EASILY

A STACKING GAME MIGHT BE FUN LIKE THIS SOMETHING LIKE WONKY OR JENA YOU COULD BE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE HOUSE AND THEN HEAR NOOOOOOO FOLLOWED BY THE SOUND OF PIECES FALLING EVERYWHERE
PUSH FIGHT COMES TO MIND GETTING YOUR HANDS ON IT ISN'T THE EASIEST AND NOT EVERYONE ENJOYS ABSTRACT STRATEGY GAMES BUT THE ANCHOR PIECE MEANS IT'S EASY TO SEE WHOSE TURN IT IS
NOT A BOARD GAME BUT VIDEOGAMES LIKE SUBTERFUGE ARE DESIGNED FOR THAT ALSO THIS VERTICAL CHESS BOARD

ITEMS

CONCEPT WOULD WORK WELL
WOULD BE IDEAL
LITERALLY ANY GAME RIGHT EDIT EXCEPT REAL-TIME GAMES
LOAR CG IS PROBABLY THE BEST SOLO CG HOWEVER A HUGE ASPECT OF THE GAME IS PLANNING FOR THE QUEST AND BUILDING A DECK TO TAKE IT ON IF THAT DOESN'T APPEAL TO YOU THEN CHECK OUT MARKHAM HORROR CG WHICH JUST STARTED AND MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF ARE REALLY ENJOYING IT IT MIXES RPG AND DECK BUILDING AND IS REALLY ELEGANTLY DESIGNED COMPARED TO OTHER SIMILAR CARD GAMES
LORD OF THE RINGS IS THE BEST I'VE SEEN
I RECENTLY GOT INTO THE LOAR CG MYSELF AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PUT IN MY TWO CENTS ABOUT IT IT'S THE FIRST CG I'VE PLAYED BUT I REALLY LIKE IT IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO PLAY SOLO YOU'LL GET A DECENT AMOUNT OF PLAY TIME OUT OF THE CORE SET

I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY THE MARKHAM HORROR CG YET BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
LOAR CG THIS IS FAR AND AWAY THE MOST DEVELOPED INTERESTING DRAMATIC AMAZING SOLO CARD GAME EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD
I IMAGINE YOUR BEST PLACES TO START ARE LOAR CG AND OR MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME CG I'VE ONLY PLAYED AHLCG I CHOSE AH OVER LOAR BECAUSE I'D HEARD THAT LOAR WAS A LOT MORE CARD GAMEY WITH CARD COMBOS AND INTERACTIONS BEING THE MEAT OF THE GAME THE GAME WASN'T DESIGNED FOR CAMPAIGN PLAY THAT MODE WAS ADDED LATER I THINK THE MAIN WAY THE GAME IS PLAYED IS THAT YOU GRAB AN INDIVIDUAL SCENARIO BUILD YOUR DECK SPECIFICALLY TO TRY AND BEAT IT AND THEN ATTEMPT TO BEAT IT THIS MEANS THERE'S LESS NARRATIVE IT'S A BIT MORE CYNICAL AND THERE'S A LOT MORE DECKBUILDING REQUIRED FOR EACH PLAY ALSO YOUR DECK JUST ABSTRACTLY REPRESENTS THE GOOD GUYS YOUR CHARACTERS ARE ALSO EITHER IN AN ABSTRACT AETHER OR AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION

AH ON THE OTHER HAND WAS DESIGNED FOR CAMPAIGN PLAY FROM THE GROUND UP YOU BUILD YOUR DECK AT THE START OF THE CAMPAIGN BUT THEN ONLY TWEAK IT BETWEEN SCENARIOS SPENDING XP GAINED ON NEW CARDS OR EVEN ON HIGHER LEVEL VERSIONS OF CARDS ALREADY IN YOUR DECK YOUR DECK ALSO REPRESENTS A SINGLE INVESTIGATOR YOUR AVATAR IN THE GAME THEY HAVE A CLASS OR CLASS COMBINATION AND DECKBUILDING RULES SPECIFIC TO THEM AS WELL AS A UNIQUE SPECIAL ITEM AND WEAKNESS THE GAMEPLAY ITSELF IS A BIT MORE OF A MIX OF RPG CG COMPARED TO LOAR AND IT HAS A SPATIAL ELEMENT AS VARIOUS LOCATIONS ARE PLACED ON THE TABLE CREATING A BOARD

BECAUSE AH HAS JUST RELEASED IT'S POTENTIALLY EASIER LESS EXPENSIVE AND LESS DAUNTING TO CATCH UP ON IMMOV ON ALL OF THE ABOVE OF COURSE
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN GO WRONG WITH LOAR CG OR MARKHAM CG I ONLY HAVE PLAYED LOAR PICKING UP MARKHAM AROUND CHRISTMAS IT'S A DEEP RICH EXPERIENCE THAT CAPTURES THE CORE MATERIAL PERFECTLY

I'VE BEEN IMMENSELY ENJOYING THE GAME AND I'M SOMEONE THAT TYPICALLY HATES CARD GAMES LIKE MEETING
EVERYONE IS RECOMMENDING LOAR OR AH CGS BUT AS FAST AS I KNOW THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO SOLO CGS IN THE MARKET ARE THERE SOME OTHER THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF
LORD OF THE RINGS CG AND MARKHAM HORROR CG ARE BOTH TRULY EXCELLENT SOLO EXPERIENCES I SUGGEST GETTING INTO THE ONE THAT SEEMS MORE THEMATICALLY INTERESTING FOR YOU

MECHANICALLY LOAR IS MORE FOCUSED ON INDIVIDUAL SCENARIOS AND BUILDING A DECK TO DEFEAT THAT SPECIFIC SCENARIO MARKHAM IS MORE FOCUSED ON EVOLVING A DECK THROUGH A SERIES OF LINKED SCENARIOS

BOTH OFFER A LOT OF RICH CHOICES AND A LOT OF INTERESTING AND ENJOYABLE UNEXPECTED EVENTS BOTH ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
PATHFINDER IS BEST PLAYED ON IOS OR ANDROID IT HELPED YOU ON DIMINISH SETUP AND CARD ORGANIZING FIDDLYNESS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE CARD POOL OF MULTIPLE SCENARIOS
YOU CAN PLAY MANY POPULAR ANDROID NETRUNNER DECKS WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING AN OPPONENT
I RECENTLY PLAYED FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE SOLO RULES IT WAS MUCH LESS COMPLICATED THAN I EXPECTED I WATCHED A LOT OF VIDEOS BEFOREHAND AND READ THROUGH THE WALK-THROUGH TWICE BEFORE SITTING DOWN TO PLAY BUT EVERYTHING MADE SENSE I RECOMMEND IT
THE FACT THAT YOU AND YOUR BROTHER ARE READY AND WILLING TO MAKE THE PLUNGE MAKES ME THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PICK IT UP YOU'LL JUST NEED TO DO A LITTLE RESEARCH THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE PLAY THROUGH FOR MAGE KNIGHT AND IT HELPED ME LEARN THE GAME A LOT PERSONALLY YOU'LL GET A FEEL FOR THE GAME AND IT'LL LIKELY CONFIRM OR DENY YOUR DESIRE TO PURCHASE IT

THE NEXT STEP IS GETTING THE GAME AND BEING WILLING TO MAKE RULE MISTAKES YOU'LL REALIZE FOUR TURNS TOO LATE THAT YOU FORGOT TO APPLY THE CITY BOON TO THE MONSTERS OR SOMETHING BUT BY THEN THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT PRESS ON SOLDIER AND LEARN FROM IT FOR NEXT TIME I STILL FORGET CITY BOONS ALL THE TIME

JUST KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T A WILD ROMP THROUGH A FANTASY COUNTRYSIDE BUT A METICULOUS AND BRILLIANT VARIATION OF PUZZLES TO EFFECTIVELY SOLVE

IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DELVE INTO SOME GOOD STRATEGY I'D RECOMMEND THIS GUYS VIDEOS LINK THEY'RE QUITE LONG THOUGH AND OBVIOUSLY NOT RECOMMENDED IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE RULES WAIT UNTIL YOU GET THAT UNDYING URGE TO PLAY HAHA
I DON'T THINK MAGE KNIGHT IS THAT HARD TO LEARN AND IT HAS A GOOD TUTORIAL THE TRICKY BIT IS REMEMBERING TO APPLY ALL THE VARIOUS RULES AT THE RIGHT POINT BUT FORGETTING TO DO SO WON'T RUIN YOUR GAME YOU'LL BE ABLE TO OOPS AND PLAY ON

THE BIGGEST BARRIER IS THAT THE RULE BOOKIES ATROCIOUS AS REFERENCE MATERIAL

I DIVED INTO MAGE KNIGHT AS ONE OF MY FIRST SOLO EXPERIENCES THOUGH I FEEL MY BACKGROUND IN ROBORALLY WAS GOOD PREPOSITION
MK IS OFTEN REFERENCED AS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX GAMES EVER MADE BUT THAT'S REALLY HYPERBOLE IT'S HEAVY AND LONG YES BUT MOST OF THE RULES ARE PRETTY INTUITIVE ONCE YOU HAVE A BIT OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE SYSTEM THERE ARE A LOT OF LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU'LL FORGET FOR YOUR FIRST COUPLE GAMES BUT THE MAP LOCATION REFERENCE CARDS HAVE MOST OF THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON THEM

JUST PLAY THE WALK-THROUGH FIRST AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU CAN ALWAYS RESELL IT FOR VERY CLOSE TO THAT PRICE
BE PREPARED TO GRIND THROUGH SOME LEARNING GAMES THAT SAID I HAVE A GROUP OF THREE THAT PLAYS EVERY WEEK AND THE GAME JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER RUNS LIKE A WELL OILED MACHINE NOW
I THINK IT'S SOMEWHAT OVERRATED GAME AND HAS TOO MANY THINGS GOING ON FOR WHAT IT REALLY OFFERS COMPARED TO MORE FOCUSED GAMES I CAN SEE THE APPEAL FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT FOR ME IT DIDN'T WORK A BIT SINCE YOU AREN'T VERY EXPERIENCED ON HEAVIER GAMES THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE MK WILL BE TOO MUCH TOO SOON

I ALSO THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF BETTER OPTIONS FOR THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS MECHANICS THAT MAGE KNIGHT HAS CRAMMED IN IT BUT THERE CERTAINLY ISN'T MANY GAMES THAT OFFER THE SAME VARIETY FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH

FOR COMPETITIVE DUNGEON CRAWLING GAME I'D GO WITH ARCADIA QUEST FOR TILE PLACEMENT EXPLORATION AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT I RECOMMEND ROBINSON CRUSOE AND FOR RPG DUNGEON CRAWLING CO-OP GAMING I WOULD CHOOSE DESCENT OR IMPERIAL ASSAULT IA IS ACTUALLY VS MANY BUT IT SHOULD GET A COMPANION APP WHICH MAKES IT FULLY CO-OP IT ALSO OFFERS A BRILLIANT VS SKIRMISH MODE
IT'S REALLY NOT HARD JUST PLOW AHEAD AND MAKE SOME RULES MISTAKES FIX THEM LATER VERY FUN AND REWARDING IS A STEAL
I WOULD SUGGEST DOING YOUR RESEARCH BEFOREHAND ASSUMING YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY IT'S A VERY DENSE AND CRUNCHY GAME THAT'S FOR SURE A GUY IN MY GAME GROUP PURCHASED IT A A LOCAL CONVENTION TWO YEARS AGO AND IT HAS YET TO BE PLAYED ALL THE WAY THROUGH

WE STARTED THE INTRODUCTORY SCENARIO SHORTLY AFTER HE PURCHASED IT WE BOTH ENJOYED IT ENOUGH JUST NOT ENOUGH TO WARRANT IT'S LONG SET UP TIME AND RULES EXPLANATION

THAT BEING SAID QUITE A FEW PEOPLE ON THIS SUB LOVE THE GAME TO DEATH IT DOES HAVE AN AWESOME SENSE OF PROGRESSION
MAGE KNIGHT IS A REALLY REALLY TOUGH GAME TO LEARN AND PLAY BUT ONLY ONE PERSON NEEDS TO KNOW ALL OF THE RULES YOU CAN SURPRISINGLY TEACH OTHERS HOW TO PLAY THE GAME EASILY IN UNDER MINUTES ONCE YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY AND IT'S SURPRISINGLY A SIMPLE GAME TO GRASP SO AS LONG AS ONE OF YOU IS COMMITTED TO LEARNING THE RULES THEN IT ACTUALLY COULD WORK BUT JUST BEAR IN MIND THAT FOR ME PERSONALLY I WATCHED PROBABLY 2 HOURS WORTH OF TUTORIALS AN HOUR OR TWO WORTH OF GAMEPLAY PLAYED A SOLO CAMPAIGN AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THEN THAT I FELT LIKE I WAS COMFORTABLE WITH THE RULES AND GUESS WHAT I HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME FOR A SOLID YEAR SO I MIGHT HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN IF I DECIDE TO PLAY IT

GREAT GAME BUT EXPECT IT TO GATHER DUST
MY GROUP HAS PLAYED MAGE KNIGHT A LOT IN COOP IN THE PAST BUT PART OF THE REASON WE STOPPED IS BECAUSE IT IS JUST TOO LONG OF A GAME WITH SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ENTRY

WHILE WE DO LOVE THE GAME OVERALL EVERY SINGLE TIME WE SAT DOWN TO PLAY IT IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST AN HOUR TO SETUP ANOTHER MINUTES TO JUST REFRESH ON THE RULES ENOUGH TO GET STARTED PLAYING AND LOTS OF CONSTANT RULES CHECKS EVER SINGLE TIME WE RAN INTO A COMBAT EXPOSED A NEW TILE WITH A NEW LOCATION TYPE TRIED TO RECRUIT A SOLDIER ETC

IF YOU HAVE THE TIME AND PATIENCE TO PLAY A GAME FOR HOURS IT IS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE AS SHUT UP SIT DOWN SAID ITS A GAME IT IS INTENSE TO SAY THE LEAST BE SURE TO GO TO BG AND PRINT OUT A SET OF RULES AT LEAST THE BACK PAGE WITH ALL THE COMBAT EFFECTS FOR EACH PLAYER

IF YOU WANT A SLIGHTLY FASTER EXPERIENCE THAT IS LESS ERROR PRONE I WOULD HAVE TO ADVISE AGAINST GETTING IT
MY PARTNER AND I ARE LONG DISTANCE SO WE PLAY A TON OF GAMES OVER SKYPE


GAMES WHERE BOTH HAVE A COPY
SMASH UP COMPLETELY PERFECT DISTANCE EVEN IF YOU JUST DIVIDE UP A FEW DECKS TO TAKE WITH YOU WE USE TO USE AND ONLINE TEXT EDITOR TO KEEP TRACK OF BASE SCORES BUT IT IS EASY TO DO OVER SKYPE AS WELL


EPIC SPELL WARS FANTASTIC EACH PERSON BASICALLY DEALS WITH THEIR OWN CARDS THEN TELLS HOW MANY POINTS OF DAMAGE PERFECT FOR SKYPE


UNSPEAKABLE WORDS A GREAT WORD GAME THAT IS SUPER SIMPLE TO PLAY DISTANCE


GAMES WHERE ONLY ONE PERSON HAS A COPY
CASTLE PANIC COOPERATIVE GAME SO IF YOUR FRIENDS HAVE THE GAME AND BOARD IT IS EASY FOR YOU TO TELL THEM WHAT MONSTERS YOU WISH TO KILL NORMALLY ALL CARDS ARE LAID OUT FOR EVERYONE TO SEE SO TRANSLATES EASILY TO SKYPE


FORBIDDEN ISLAND DESERT ANOTHER CO-OP GAME SUPER EASY TO PLAY DISTANCE SINCE NOTHING IS SECRET AND EVERYONE WORKS TOGETHER JUST TELL THE OTHER PLAYERS WHERE TO MOVE YOU AND HAVE THEM DRAW UP STORM CARDS
SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE WORKS REALLY WELL LIKE THIS MORE APPROPRIATELY THE MARTIAN INVESTIGATIONS WHICH I WROTE AND MYTHOS TALES ARE BOTH SIMILAR TO CONSULTING DETECTIVE BUT CAN BE BOUGHT AS PDF FILES AND CAN BE PLAYED ON SCREEN SO IT'S EASIER AND CHEAPER TO GET THE MULTIPLE COPIES YOU NEED
DIPLOMACY WORKS WELL
DDK HOW MANY ARE YOU BUT MAYBE SPECTER OPS IF YOU ARE THE SPY JUST ASK ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS TO READ THE CARDS AND YOU CHOOSE 2 OR DONT REMEMBER AND HAVE THEM ANNOUNCE THEIR GRID AT THE END OF EACH MOVEMENT TO KEEP TRACK ON YOUR SHEET AND IF YOU ARE THE AGENT AGAIN KEEP TRACK ON THE SHEET
I'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS PLAYING ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE AND D TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL A BOARD GAME ENTIRELY OVER HANGOUTS WITH NO TWO PLAYERS IN THE SAME ROOM I IMAGINE THEY WOULD WORK WELL WITH JUST ONE REMOTE PLAYER AS WELL
DUNGEON CRAWLERS SHOULD WORK IF YOU SEE THE BOARD VIA WEBCAM

CODENAMES SMALL WORLD PEN AND PAPER RAGS STORYTELLING GAMES LIKE ONCE UPON A TIME OR WESTERN CITY OR FIASCO RUSSIAN RAILROADS VILLAGE AXIS ALLIES ETC
IF YOU TAKE THE RIGHT BITS WITH YOU LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL

YOU'LL HAVE TO BE JACK BUT THAT WILL WORK REALLY WELL IF YOU HAVE THE PLAYER SCREEN AS IT HAS THE MAP ON
I WOULD SAY MOST GAMES WITHOUT HIDDEN INFORMATION ESPECIALLY CO-OP WOULD WORK WELL YOU WOULD OBVIOUSLY NEED YOUR OWN COPY FOR THE DICE GAMES OR HAVE SOMEBODY DOING THE ROLLING FOR YOU A QUICK GLANCE AT MY COLLECTION AND I WOULD SAY ALL OF THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE DOABLE UNLESS I REMEMBER THE RULES WRONG WHICH MIGHT VERY WELL BE THE CASE

PUERTO RICO
TROYES
DOMINANT SPECIES
FORMULA DE
ROBINSON CRUSOE
EL GRANDE HAVE A LIST OF ALL YOUR CARDS AND MARK THEM AS YOU PLAY THEM WRITE DOWN ON PAPER WHEN CHOOSING REGION
KING OF TOKYO NEW YORK
CARSON CITY
MACHI BORO
LEADER
NUNS ON THE RUN
ECLIPSE
DESCENT
IMPERIAL ASSAULT
SUPER FANTASY UGLY SNOUTS ASSAULT
CONAN
MISSION RED PLANET IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY SHOWING YOU THE EVENT CARDS
GROUND FLOOR
RUSH N CRUSH

EDIT REALIZED I HAD A COUPLE MORE GAMES
SEAWALL SEEMS LIKE THE ODD MAN OUT ON THAT LIST AND I'D RECOMMEND YOU RESEARCH IT PRETTY THOROUGHLY AVOIDING SPOILERS IF POSSIBLE OUR GROUP FOUND IT VERY DRY AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE FIRST LEGACY GAME WE QUIT WITHOUT FINISHING SOME PEOPLE LOVE IT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO APPEAL TO EVERYONE
YOU CAN ALSO GIVE A SHOT AT THE D D BOARD GAMES

DUNGEONS DRAGONS CASTLE RAVENLOFT BOARD GAME
DUNGEONS DRAGONS WRATH OF ASHARDALON BOARD GAME
DUNGEONS DRAGONS THE LEGEND OF DRIZZLE BOARD GAME
DUNGEONS DRAGONS TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL BOARD GAME
THAT LIST LOOKS PRETTY SOLID FOR GAMES WITH THAT DUNGEON CRAWL RPG FEELING

FOR MORE DUNGEON CRAWL GAMES CHECK OUT STAR WARS IMPERIAL ASSAULT MASMORRA DUNGEONS OF ARCADIA AND SUPER DUNGEON EXPLORE I HAVEN'T PLAYED ANY OF THOSE YET MYSELF BUT THEY ALL SOUND LIKE A LOT OF FUN

OUT OF CURIOSITY WHAT DID YOU DO WRONG IN YOUR FIRST M M PLAYTHROUGH MY FIRST PLAYTHROUGH WAS WITH MY F AND I TOTALLY FORGOT THAT YOU START WITH ABILITIES AND DON'T HAVE TO LEVEL UP TO GET ONE FORTUNATELY I NOTICED THAT RULE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR FIRST BIG FIGHT WITH A CENTIPEDE WHICH REALLY SAVED OUR BUTTS TOO BAD WE STILL LOST THE CHAPTER
AS FAR AS PAINTING GOES FORASTERO HAS A YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND DOES GREAT INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS ON SPECIFIC MINIATURES AND HOW TO PAINT THEM IMPERIAL ASSAULT PAINTING GUIDE

HAVEN'T FOUND A MICE AND MYSTICS VIDEO I LIKED
DESCENT IS THE KING OF DUNGEON CRAWLERS IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF CONTENT IF NOTHING ELSE I LOVE IT AND PLAY EVERY WEEK WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS THE VS ALL ASPECT IS APPEALING TO A LOT OF GROUPS MANY OF THE OTHERS ARE FULL CO-OP NOT A BAD THING JUST DIFFERENT
AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU HAVE A GAME THAT YOU LIKE AND THAT YOU PLAY A LOT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH FOCUSING ON THAT FOR A WHILE PLAY THE BASE GAME GET THE EXPANSIONS PAINT THE FIGURES REALLY GET YOUR WORTH OUT OF IT
GLOOMHAVEN LOOKS REALLY GOOD BUT IT'S BASICALLY UNKNOWN AT THIS POINT WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR REPORTS FROM THE KS BACKERS
M M IS ON MY LIST ACTUALLY I LOVE THE LOOK OF THE MINIATURES ESPECIALLY THE UNDEAD CAT FROM ONE OF THE EXPANSIONS SPEAKING OF MINIATURES DON'T FORGET TO CHECK OUT R MINIPAINTING FOR ANOTHER FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL COMMUNITY
THE GENRE IS VERY CAMEY BE CAREFUL OF FATIGUE IF YOU BUY TOO MANY AT ONCE WHY NOT TRY A DIFFERENT STYLE OF GAME
TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES
HOW DID YOU PLAY IT WITH OTHER THAN THE LAST MISSION THERE IS A MAXIMUM OF MICE PER MISSION OR LESS FOR SOME
QUICK QUESTION DOES M M REQUIRE A GAME MASTER ANTAGONIST TYPE PLAYER OR IS IT CO-OP LIKE ZOMBICIDE

ONE OF MY BIGGEST COMPLAINTS ABOUT IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS I'M ALWAYS STUCK PLAYING THE EMPIRE
I HAVE GLOOMHAVEN PREORDERED WASN'T A HUGE FAN OF DESCENT
HOW DO YOU TOLERATE THE ENDLESS ROLLING AND MOVEMENT OF M M I WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME SO MUCH BUT DAMN THEM DICE

SECONDING WHAT MOST PEOPLE SAID ABOUT SEAWALL BEING THE ODD ONE OUT

I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH STAR WARS IMPERIAL ASSAULT AND SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE

IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS AN RPG IN A BOX BUT REQUIRES A DM OF SORTS THE PLAYERS PLAY AS REBELLION HEROES CUSTOM ONES FROM THE GAME NOT HAN LUKE ETC AND THE DM PLAYS AS THE IMPERIALS IMPERIALS HAVE TO MANAGE THINGS LIKE REINFORCEMENTS MAP SETUP EVENT TRIGGERS ETC WHICH ARE ALL OUTLINED IN A SCENARIO BOOK EXAMPLE OPEN DOOR TO BUILDING REVEAL THE ENEMIES INSIDE AS AN EVENT

THE COOL PART ABOUT IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS IT'S NOT LIKE MICE AND MYSTICS WHERE IF YOU FAIL A MISSION YOU START OVER THERE'S BRANCHING PATH STORIES MISSIONS FAIL MOST MISSIONS SIMPLY TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH AND YOU CAN GET DIFFERENT ENDINGS TOO

SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE IS A LITTLE MORE CONTROVERSIAL I THINK ON THIS BOARD IT'S A KICKSTARTER FROM A FEW YEARS AGO WHERE THE DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER THINGS WEREN'T HANDLED WELL IT WASN'T DUE TO ANY SORT OF INTENTIONAL NEGLECT MORE JUST OH SHIT WE SERIOUSLY OVER PROMISED AND DIDN'T EXPECT THIS MUCH INTEREST

THE GAME ITSELF IS A RPG DUNGEON CRAWLER LIKE MICE AND MYSTICS YOU PLAY AS A HERO BUT YOU GET A CHARACTER SHEET YOU GAIN LEVELS HAVE STATS INCREASE ABILITIES AND MAKE SAVING ROLLS AND STUFF MORE LIKE D D THERE'S NO REAL END TO THE GAME YOU PLAY SCENARIOS IN THE BOOK THE ACTUAL ROLE-PLAYING IS LIGHT AS THERE'S A BOARD YOU REVEAL A MAP TILE BY TILE AND BUILD A DYNAMIC MINE DUNGEON YOU DISCOVER PORTALS TO ALTERNATE DIMENSIONS YOU GET GEAR LOOT FIGHT MONSTERS AND ACCIDENTALLY MUTATE A SECOND HEAD WHICH GIVES YOU SUPER POWERS

THERE'S ALSO A TOWN INTERLUDE FOR YOU TO STOCK UP ON GEAR AND SPEND YOUR CASH OR YOU KNOW YOU ACCIDENTALLY DESTROY THE TOWN

THIS IS A GAME HEAVY ON RANDOM EVENTS THE RULES ARE SUPER COMPLEX BUT IT'S THEMATIC AS HELL AND LEADS TO AWESOME CHARACTER INTERACTIONS AND STUFF
THIS HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET BUT TRY TO LOOK FOR NEAR AND FAR WHILE IT IS NOT A COOP GAME IT HAS HEAVY STORY ELEMENTS A MORE FOCUSED VERSION OF TALES OF ARABIAN NIGHTS AS FAR AS I CAN SEE
I WOULD PUT FORWARD MANSIONS OF MADNESS AS WELL IT'S VERY NARRATIVE DRIVEN HAS A QUICK SET UP AND IS A GREAT BREAK FROM SCI-FI FANTASY GENRES THAT TEND TO DOMINATE THE HOBBY

EACH SCENARIO PLAYS LIKE A ONE SHOT BUT IT CAN STRETCH ACROSS MULTIPLE HOURS YOU CAN SAVE YOUR PROGRESS I THINK IT WOULD DO WELL WITH YOUR GROUP
I OWN MICE AND MYSTICS DESCENT AND IT'S EXPANSIONS AND ARCADIA QUEST

ALL THE GAMES ARE GREAT BUT I LOVE ARCADIA QUEST IT HAS THE ABILITY TO JUST PICK UP AND PLAY A GAME OR TWO WITH FRIENDS BUT ALSO HAS A ROBUST CAMPAIGN WHERE YOU CAN ACQUIRE ITEMS AND WEAPONS LIKE MICE AND MYSTICS IT HAS NO OVERLORD SO EVERYONE PLAYS BUT IT ALSO HAS PLAYER VS PLAYER SO IN ADDITION TO LEVEL QUESTS YOU CAN KILL YOU OPPONENT IT MEANS EVERY PLAYER IS ON THEIR OWN SO NO QUARTERBACKING FROM ONE PLAYER TRYING TO MIN MAX EVERY TURN BUT DYING DOESN'T REMOVE YOU FROM THE GAME FINALLY EVERY PLAYER HAS CHARACTERS THEY RUN SO YOU AREN'T STUCK JUST DOING ONE THING LIKE A WARRIOR YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL

ARCADIA QUEST IS OUTSTANDING AND SHOULD BE UP FOR CONSIDERATION
WHERE ARE YOU LOCATED I AM THE SOLE US REPORT I TYPICALLY HANDLE ALL US CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND I AM UNAWARE OF THIS ISSUE COMPLETELY

IF YOU AREN'T IN THE US I CAN LIKELY STILL HELP YOU PLEASE FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME ANY TIME WITH CONCERNS CHEVEE AT PORTALGAMES DOT PL
DEAR SIR
I AM SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES

TODAY I PERSONALLY LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE I FOUND IN OUR SYSTEM EMAILS SENT TO YOU IN THE PAST WEEKS AND MONTHS THESE WERE SENT
10TH OF MAY
5TH OF JULY
OF OCTOBER
THREE EMAILS ON OF OCTOBER

I ALSO FOUND IN OUR SYSTEM YOUR EMAIL SENT TO US ON OF OCTOBER WITH INFORMATION THAT EVERYTHING IS OK WITH THE ORDER

AS FAR AS I CHECKED TODAY IN OUR SYSTEM YOUR HISTORY OF INTERACTION WITH OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS VERY GOOD YOU WERE RECEIVING REPLIES FAST AND ON REGULAR BASIS I AM VERY SORRY THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING AND THAT THERE IS SOME REPLY YOU STILL AWAITS FOR PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES

I AM HAPPY TO SEE THAT CHEVEE OUR U SOUTH REP IMMEDIATELY JUMP IN TO HELP YOU AND I AM HAPPY YOU TWO ARE IN TOUCH


SIDE NOTE TRACKING ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND GETTING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE COMPANY BASED ON SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS MIGHT BE NOT THE BEST IDEA AS OUR FANS SAW ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THE PAST WEEKS PORTAL GAMES WAS MOVING TO THE NEW OFFICES WE WERE MOVING WHOLE WAREHOUSE OFFICES EVERYTHING OUR WEBSTORE AND OUR WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION WAS CLOSED FOR TWO WEEKS AND INFORMATION ABOUT IT WAS POSTED IN THE WEBSTORE THE WHOLE COMPANY WAS STOPPED FOR THREE WEEKS WE WERE PACKING STUFF MOVING STUFF AND UNPACKING STUFF BASICALLY COMPANY WAS MOVING PRODUCTS AND NOT WORKING

IT DIDN'T STOPPED OUR MARKETING IT ACTUALLY MADE IT EVEN MORE ACTIVE WE WERE EXCITED ABOUT THIS BIG EVENT WE WERE POSTING VIDEOS ON SNAPCHAT AND PICTURES ON TWITTER VERY INTENSE IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT OUR FANS EXPECTED BE PART OF THIS SUPER IMPORTANT MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE COMPANY WE WERE ACTIVE ON SOCIAL BECAUSE WE LOVE OUR FANS AND WE INTERACT WITH THEM BEING CLOSE TO FANS AND TALK WITH THEM ON FB OR TWITTER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT FOR THREE WEEKS THE COMPANY WAS BASICALLY CLOSED AND IN MOVING PROCESS
I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS I'VE ALWAYS HAD GOOD SUPPORT EXPERIENCES WITH PORTAL THEY'VE SENT ME A NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT PARTS AS WELL AS HELPED ME WITH SOME ORDERING ISSUES AS SOMEONE SAID MAYBE THINGS GOT LOST IN THE ESSEN MADNESS
MY DEALINGS WITH PORTAL GAMES HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT PROFESSIONAL I'M SURE YOUR PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED
I AM POLISH AND I AGREE THEY SHOULD ENGAGE WAY MORE TO SUPPORT THEIR CUSTOMERS

I LOVE IMPERIAL SETTLERS GAME IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY EXPANSION THIS IS BECAUSE MY VERSION FIRST RELEASE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EXPANSIONS THEY HAVE MADE ERROR IN CARDS AND NEWER PRINTS COME WITH UPDATED CARDS THEY SUGGESTED PEOPLE TO PRINT AND GLUE NOTES ON THE CARDS

I WILL SAY THIS LOUD FUCK THAT PORTAL GAMES I WOULD BUY EXPANSIONS IF YOU COULD ADD THOSE UPDATED CARDS FROM BASIC GAME FOR FREE BUT THEY REFUSE IGNORANT BASTARDS PEOPLE EVEN ASKED IF THEY CAN PAY TO GET THOSE CARDS BUT ANSWER WAS NOT RIDICULOUS

WHEN I AM STUCK DESPERATELY TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH A BUSINESS ON SOCIAL NETWORKING SYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A CLEAR AND EASY WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM BY A PROPER WEBSITE CONTACT PAGE OR EMAIL ADDRESS I AM QUICK TO SOUR ON DEALING WITH THEM VERY UNPROFESSIONAL IMO

I'VE NEVER DEALT WITH THESE GUYS DIRECTLY PROBABLY NEVER WILL SINCE I LIVE IN CANADA BUT I FEEL YOUR MISERY
I HAD SIMILAR ISSUES WITH PORTAL GAMES WHEN I STATE MASTER SET FROM THEM

ORIGINALLY THEY PROMISED COPIES WOULD ARRIVE ROUGHLY A MONTH BEFORE THE STORES GOT THEIR COPIES

THEN THEY STOPPED TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO SHIP IT THEN THEY SENT ME A SHIPPING NOTICE WITH NO TRACKING INFORMATION LOCAL STORES GOT COPIES IN MY COPY WAS STILL ON THE WAY

I EMAILED THEM THEY TOLD ME TO CHECK THE WEBSITE THAT I'D NOT ONLY ALREADY CHECKED BUT INCLUDED SCREENSHOTS FROM SCREENSHOTS THAT SHOWED A LACK OF TRACKING INFORMATION I TWEETED THEM THEY TOLD ME TO EMAIL THEM I POSTED QUESTIONS TO THEIR SITE THOSE QUESTIONS GOT MODERATED I WAS NOT IMPRESSED

EVENTUALLY MY COPY ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION HOWEVER THE EXPERIENCE TURNED ME OFF FROM THEM AGAIN

AT ONE POINT I ASKED THEM IF IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO USE A CANADIAN RESHIPPING COMPANY MENTIONED ONE BY NAME I WAS TOLD THAT THEY'D TALKED TO THEM AND IT WASN'T VIABLE FROM MY OWN DEALINGS WITH THAT COMPANY IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL THAT THEY WERE SPOKEN TO

THEY TALK A GOOD GAME BUT THEY DON'T REALLY LIVE UP TO IT I WON'T FIRST MARTIANS FROM THEM ASSUMING I EVEN BUY IT AT THIS POINT
HOW DID YOU PAY YOU SHOULD GO THROUGH THE BANK PALPAL AND OPEN A CASE DISPUTE YOU WERE LIED TO VIA FALSE ADVERTISING THEY WILL LISTEN IF YOU INVOLVE MONEY ALSO KEEP IT FORMAL RESPECTFUL AND DON'T GET EMOTIONAL
DUMB QUESTION SINCE OF COURSE YOU DID BUT DID YOU CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER
PROBABLY JUST BUSY WITH THE CON SEASON MERRY WIFE WAS VERY HELPFUL WHEN A COPY OF STATE I'D PURCHASED FROM MILAN SPIEL WAS MISSING A WHOLE SHEET OF TOKENS

IF YOU DON'T GET ANY RESPONSE YOU CAN ALWAYS CONTACT THE DESIGNER S THROUGH BG OR EVEN FACEBOOK I DID THAT BG MAIL FOR SOME MISSING SHIPS FOR MADEIRA AND I GOT THE CONTACT THROUGH THEM
CON SEASON
I'VE BEEN IN EMAIL CONTACT WITH PORTALGAMES SUPPORT ABOUT SOME DAMAGED MISSING IMPERIAL SETTLERS AZTECS PROMOS FROM THE COPY I PREORDERED
THEY CLAIM THEY SENT OUT THE REPLACEMENT PRETTY MUCH RIGHT AWAY IT'S BEEN ABOUT WEEKS BUT I DON'T COUNT THAT AS LATE YET
SO FAR I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THEM WILL SEE IF THE CARDS DON'T ARRIVE IN ANOTHER FEW WEEKS
I PLAYED THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS IN AN DEVELOPMENT PHASE AND I LOVED IT
ALL MY SUPPORT
I WAS A BACKER ON THE FIRST CAMPAIGN GLAD TO SEE YOU GUYS BACK FOR ANOTHER TRY
UPVOTES AND COMMENTS GOOD JOB GETTING SHILLS TO COME VOTE FOR YOU
HUH I WASN'T VERY IMPRESSED A LOT OF NICHE OR GAMES I DIDN'T DO AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH BUT HERE ARE A FEW ITEMS THAT STOOD OUT TO ME

BATTLE LINE

TRAINS

PAGODA

KING OF TOKYO 2ND EDITION
MAYBE COOLSTUFF WILL HAVE A BETTER SALE

I HAD A REALLY HARD TIME JUST GETTING TO THE FREE S H MARK AND EVEN THEN EMPTIED MY CART SINCE HALF OF IT WAS JUST I COULD GET THESE THINGS BUT I DON'T REALLY WANT NEED THEM

THE LAST 2 MM SALES WERE MUCH BETTER
HARRY POTTER HOGWARTS BATTLE FOR IS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL
UNFORTUNATELY NOTHING OF INTEREST TO ME IN THIS SALE THE CLOSEST WAS POTION EXPLOSION BUT I WON'T BE PICKING ANYTHING UP
AND THE CROWD GOES MILD
I JUST BOUGHT PANDEMIC RISE OF CTHULHU AND I SEE IT ON THERE FOR HALF THE PRICE JUST MY LUCK
I'D GET IMHOTEP IF I DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE IT NOTHING ELSE REALLY INTERESTING
I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO MM SALES JUST TO SEE HOW LOW WARMACHINE HIGH COMMAND WILL GO

IF SHIPPING COSTS WEREN'T AN ISSUE FOR ME I'D GRAB THE GAME JUST TO SEE IF IT'S THAT BAD
GETTING SOLD OUT FAST OF ALL THE THINGS I WANT THINGS IN A ROW IT'S IN STOCK WHEN I LOOK BUT AFTER ADDING TO THE CART IT'S OUT OF STOCK A MINUTE OR TWO LATER
I PICKED UP AGENTS OF SMEARS 2ND EDITION BUNDLE FOR BEEN TOLD IT'S A GOOD ONE FOR FANS OF TALES OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
NOTICED PANDEMIC LEGACY AND FALLING SKY IN THERE BUT GOING TO PASS ON THIS ONE
IF YOU LIKE SEAWALL IT'S ON SALE FOR ON AMAZON TO COMPARE
NOTHING FOR ME EITHER WOMP THE INVENTORY ON SALE SEEMS TO BE SPREAD TOO THIN IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE
FOR INSTANCE WITH MINIATURES THERE ARE VERY FEW ITEMS FOR EACH FACTION UNDER EACH GAME
I ENDED UP GETTING

GARBAGE DAY SILVER CAN EDITION
DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG
AND FLOCK BECAUSE WHAT THE HELL IT'S SEVEN BUCKINGHAMSHIRE
GUILDS OF LONDON ALMOST MADE ME JUMP BUT I'M NOT SURE I'LL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS OTHERS SO I THINK I CAN PASS WALLET AND SHELVES SAVED
LAGOON IS THIS GAME WAS WRONGFULLY OVERLOOKED REALLY BEAUTIFUL ART AND A FUN GAME OF SETTING UP COMBOS AND POSITIONING AROUND A SHIFTING BOARD

TWO OF THE EXCEED SETS ARE EACH AND QUITE A STEAL AS WELL THIS IS A FIGHTING CARD GAME SIMILAR TO BATTLETOWN FROM THE SAME COMPANY
STARTED TO FILL MY CART WITH ABOUT A DOZEN GAMES UNTIL I REALISED HOW LUDICROUS THEIR CANADIAN SHIPPING FEES ARE
THE SALE A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS BETTER FOR ME DIDN'T HAVE A TON OF GAMES I WAS LOOKING TO BUY BUT NONE OF THEM REALLY STOOD OUT ON THIS ONE SHRUG
THANK GOD I MADE IT OUT ALIVE NOTHING TOO INTERESTING THIS TIME AROUND
PICK UP CRAFTSMEN IF YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF HEAVY GAMES
SELECTION IS A LITTLE MUTED NO MAJOR BIG STANDOUTS TO ME ONLY GAME I WANTED STATE MASTER SET WAS SOLD OUT REAL QUICK
ENDED UP GETTING DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG AND LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS FIREFLY AS TWO ITEMS ON SALE AND NABBED A COPY OF WONDERS DUEL NOT A SALE ITEM BECAUSE I PLAYED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST WEEK AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT ADD SOME NEW TWISTS INTO MY COLLECTION WITH FIREFLY AND DUEL AND DECEPTION CAME MORE FROM HOW FAST SECRET HITLER LANDED AS OUR BIG GROUP GAME
NOT REALLY GREAT FOR THOSE NOT IN THE US
AND EVERYTHING I AM INTERESTED IN IS OUT OF STOCK
I ALMOST JUMPED ON BURAN GUILDS OF LONDON ARCHON AND FALLING SKIES UNFORTUNATELY BURAN WAS THE ONLY ONE I WAS ABOUT TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON BUT IT WENT OUT OF STOCK I ALSO REALLY WANTED FALLING SKIES BUT I HAVE OTHER COIN GAMES THAT I HAVEN'T PLAYED YET AND I AM NOT SURE WHEN THEY WILL GET PLAYED
THE RUNE AGE EXPANSION WAS THE ONLY THING THAT INTERESTED ME MOST OF THIS STUFF HAS BEEN ON CLEARANCE FOR MONTHS WITH NO REAL PRICE CHANGE
THEY HAVE COCKROACH POKER FOR

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT IT ALWAYS GETS A GOOD REACTION AND GETS PLAYED MORE THAN ONCE WHEN IT GETS PULLED OUT PLAYS IN MINUTES SO IT'S A PERFECT FUN FILLER
ANYBODY KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO A CYBER MONDAY SALE
MY TAKEAWAY

I OVERPAID FOR SOME OF MY GAMES

INCLUDING ONE OR TWO WHICH ARE STILL SITTING IN A MM CUSTOMER HOLD WAITING FOR A FEW EXPANSIONS

I HOPE THEY ALL REACH MM IN TIME TO REACH ME BEFORE CHRISTMAS NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE GIFTS BUT BECAUSE THE HOLIDAYS ARE A GREAT TIME TO PLAY BOARD GAMES AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE A STACK OF NEW ONES ALAS BOARD GAME RELEASE DATES ARE MIGHTY FICKLE

THOUGH I AM CURRENTLY WAFFLING ON ADDING POTION EXPLOSION TO MY CUSTOMER HOLD HOPEFULLY I'LL WAFFLE LONG ENOUGH FOR IT TO SELL OUT THIS MONTH IS GETTING EXPENSIVE
DELETED
THE OLDEST GAME ON MY SHELF IS FORBIDDEN ISLAND I DON'T PULL IT OUT AS OFTEN AS I USED TO BUT I'LL NEVER TURN DOWN A GAME IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ONES I PICKED UP WHEN I INITIALLY GOT INTERESTED IN BOARD GAMES

HIVE IS ALSO AN EVERGREEN I KEEP DISCOVERING MORE LAYERS TO IT MORE WAYS TO INTERACT WITH THE BUGS MORE COMBINATIONS TO STUN AND ENCIRCLE THE OPPONENT'S QUEEN HELPS THAT IT'S AS WELL

AS FAR AS SHEER NUMBER OF PLAYS THAT CROWN IS SQUARELY ON THE HEAD OF CARCASSONNE WHEN WE CAN'T DECIDE ON SOMETHING IT'S CARCASSONNE WHEN WE'RE TOO DRUNK TIRED IRRITABLE DISTRACTED FOR OTHER GAMES CARCASSONNE WHEN THERE'S PEOPLE NEW TO BOARDGAMES CARCASSONNE IT'S ALMOST UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE

EDIT I TOOK OLDEST TO MEAN WHAT I'VE OWNED THE LONGEST APPARENTLY OTHERS TOOK IT TO MEAN WHEN A GAME WAS RELEASED OH WELL
FOR ME IT'S AGRICOLA PRIMARILY PLAYS IT WITH MY SO AND IT HAS BEEN OUR FAVORITE GAME EVER SINCE THE AMOUNT OF DECKS AND EXPANSIONS JUST KEEPS IT GOING FOR US REPLACEABILITY IS QUITE HIGH AND IT LEAVES US TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND CARD COMBOS UNTIL NOW AND IT HAS BEEN CLOSE TO TWO YEARS
YOU GUYS ARE MAKING ME FEEL LIKE AN OLD FART

EL GRANDE IS MINE CLASSIC THAT INSPIRED COUNTLESS OF DESIGNERS
WE TEND TO GET RID OF GAMES AFTER A FEW PLAYS IF THEY DON'T EXCITE US OR DON'T OFFER ENOUGH DEPTH VARIABILITY SOME GAMES THAT WE'VE HAD FOR A YEAR THAT STILL GET PLAYED ARE

ISTANBUL
CONCORDIA
KANKAN
THE ALLERGIST
RACE FOR THE GALAXY
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY
KEYFLOWER
BATTLEPLANE
QUANTUM
PICTOMANIA
CODENAMES

SOME THAT I SEE STICKING AROUND ARE FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE BATTLETOWN HIVE FIELDS OF ARLE AND PROBABLY FEAST FOR ODIN
I STILL PLAY ACQUIRE WHICH IS OLDER THAN THE VAST MAJORITY OF FOLKS IN THIS SUB CAN'T STOP HISTORY OF THE WORLD EL GRANDE SETTLERS OF CATAN TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES AND ALHAMBRA
BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA
DOMINION

FIRST GAME I BOUGHT BACK IN WHEN I JOINED THE HOBBY STILL PLAY IT PRETTY REGULARLY MOST GAMES WE PLAY A WHOLE BUNCH ONCE WE FIRST GET IT AND THEN BASICALLY NEVER TOUCH IT AGAIN

NOT DOMINION THOUGH
I'VE BEEN PLAYING BOARD GAMES AS A MAJOR HOBBY SINCE I WAS NEWLY MARRIED IN AND DABBLED IN THEM THROUGHOUT MY LIFE

CAN'T STOP THE BEST FILLER GAME OF ALL TIME FOR 2 TO PLAYERS I'VE PLAYED IT HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND I NEVER TIRE OF IT THE BEST PART IS A GAME ONLY LASTS TO MINUTES

DOMINION NOT NEARLY AS OLD AS SOME OF MY OTHER GAMES BUT IT HAS GOTTEN CONSISTENT PLAY THROUGHOUT THE YEARS IT HELPS THAT IT IS EASY TO LEARN HAS LOTS TO MASTER AND PRETTY QUICK TO PLAY

GOA THE BEST AUCTION GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED THIS GAME WORKS GREAT FOR ANY NUMBER 2 TO AND PLAYS WITHIN TO MINUTES ONCE LEARNED

KINGSBURG THE BEST DICE ROLLING GAME ALTHOUGH TROYES MAY BE CLOSE THAT I HAVE PLAYED IT LOOKS COMPLICATED AT FIRST BUT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE TO LEARN IF TAUGHT BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT TO DO THE EXPANSION WHILE NOT NECESSARY GIVES IT A LOT OF

COSMIC ENCOUNTER THIS ONE BREAKS MY HEART I'VE OWNED IT FOR YEARS AND LOVE THE GAME IT'S FELL THROUGH WITH ALL OF MY FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY ALL PLAY IT WRONG THESE SAME FRIENDS WHO CAN BE COLD AND HEARTLESS IN OTHER GAMES PLAY WAY TOO NICE IN THIS GAME I LOVE THE NEGOTIATION AND SPECIAL POWERS IN THE GAME AND THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST ALL TIME GAMES IF ONLY I COULD PLAY IT MORE
AUF ACHE WHICH WAS SPIEL DES JAURES IN AND WAS FIRST RELEASED IN IS STILL ONE OF MY MOST REGULARLY PLAYED GAMES
BEEN IN THE HOBBY ABOUT YEARS NOW AND THERE ARE TWO GAMES FROM RELATIVELY EARLY ON THAT WE STILL PLAY REGULARLY

RAILWAYS OF THE WORLD RAILROAD TYCOON EDITION
ACQUIRE
I GOT SMALL WORLD WHEN IT CAME OUT AND I STILL PULL IT OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS I ALSO HAVE A CLAPTON OF EXPANSIONS FOR IT
IT'S MARVEL LEGENDARY BOUGHT IT A FEW YEARS AGO AND NO DECK BUILDER HAS MANAGED TO DETHRONE IT ALTHOUGH A FEW ARE LOOKING INTERESTING CLANK GLOOMHAVEN AND EVEN THE ATTACK ON TITAN CARD GAME
DESCENT IS MINE BY FAR I'VE BEEN PLAYING SINCE THE 1ST EDITION CAME OUT WELL MAYBE A YEAR OR SO AFTER RELEASE MY FRIEND BACK HOME HAS ALL THE STUFF WHEN I GOT BACK INTO GAMING AFTER MOVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY DESCENT WAS THE FIRST GAME I BOUGHT
HONORABLE MENTION TO AXIS AND ALLIES WHICH I DON'T PLAY AS OFTEN BUT I'VE HAD ONE EDITION OR ANOTHER FOR YEARS MAKING IT MY LONGEST OWNED GAME BY A MILE
AGRICOLA

FORBIDDEN ISLAND

STONE AGE

CARCASSONNE
I'VE HAD REPUBLIC OF ROME SINCE AND I STILL PLAY IT ABOUT TWICE A YEAR

I'D PLAY IT MORE BUT IT'S A HEAVY GAME SO GETTING A GROUP TOGETHER IS TOUGH
CAELUS
SURPRISINGLY IT IS SETTLERS OF CATAN NO MATTER HOW MANY GAMES MY GROUP PLAYS WE ALWAYS ENJOY A GOOD GAME OF PLAYER CATAN
TOP GAMES FROM BEFORE

ELFENLAND

MIKAL

CITADELS

LOST CITIES

BONANZA

MODERN ART

RAVENS

HERA ZEUS

TRANSAMERICA

CARCASSONNE
ACQUIRE IS THE GAME THAT HAS WITHSTOOD THE TEST OF TIME PIT IS ANOTHER FUN QUICK GAME TO END A GAME NIGHT

DIPLOMACY AND ADVANCE CIVILIZATION COME OUT A FEW TIMES A YEAR
HONESTLY FLUX ESPECIALLY WITH THE PLETHORA OF VERSIONS OUT THERE WITH MONTY PYTHON FLUX AND STAR FLUX BEING FAVORITES IT'S A GAME PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PLAY EVEN WHEN THE PLAN WASN'T TO PLAY GAMES WE PLAY AT LEAST ONE SESSION EVERY GAME NIGHT AND THEMED RULES BREAK OUT A LOT OF CHUCKLES FLUX ISN'T COMPLICATED AND IT QUICK TO TEACH WHICH HELPS FLUX WAS THE GATEWAY DRUG FOR A LOT OF MY FRIENDS
FORBIDDEN ISLAND WAS ALREADY SAID I THINK MY NEXT BEST ONE IS DIXIT VERY CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY APPLES TO APPLES FEEL BUT JUST ENOUGH DEPTH
THE LONGEST ONE THAT'S STILL IN OUR COLLECTION WOULD BE OUR ORIGINAL COPY OF ROBORALLY WHICH I BOUGHT IN

WE STILL HAVE OUR COPY OF SETTLERS OF CATAN ALONGSIDE SEAFARERS OF CATAN AND CITIES AND KNIGHTS OF CATAN AND THE FULL PLAYER EXPANSIONS FOR ALL THAT I BOUGHT IN THE ONLY THING THAT'S CHANGED ABOUT IT IS I REPLACED THE RESOURCE CARDS IT DOESN'T GET PLAYED AS OFTEN AS IT USED TO BUT IT STILL GETS PLAYED

SAME WITH OUR COPIES OF RA AND CARCASSONNE BOTH OF WHICH WE PURCHASED PRETTY CLOSE TO LAUNCH AND RESPECTIVELY
FOR MY GROUP IT IS BATTLE STAR GALACTICA IT IS THE ONE GAME THAT IS GUARANTEED TO BE PLAYED MULTIPLE TIMES A YEAR WITH MY GROUP
BOTH OF THE 2 PLAYER CATAN GAMES THAT WERE RELEASED BACK IN THE STILL SHINE WONDERS DUEL IS GETTING A LOT OF PRESS BUT I FIND IT INFERIOR TO EITHER OF THEM I BELIEVE THEY THE MEDIEVAL THEMED CATAN RECENTLY BUT I HAVEN'T TRIED IT HOPEFULLY IT'S AS GOOD AS THE PREDECESSOR
I'VE GOT SOME CLASSIC SPI AND AVALON HILL GAMES THAT WE MAKE A POINT OF PLAYING AS A GROUP FROM TIME TO TIME

I'M ESPECIALLY KEEN ON A DOUBLE BLIND GAME OF SUBMARINE ONE GROUP PLAYS THE ESCORTS AND DIRECTS THE CONVOY THE OTHER PLAYS THE ATTACKING WOOLPACK ONE GUY ACTS AS THE JUDGE TO RESOLVE ALL THE SPOTTING BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS

I USED TO THINK THAT WAS A BORING JOB FOR THE POOR BLOKE TASKED WITH IT BUT HE SIMPLY LOVED SEEING HOW BOATS WOULD SQUIRM TO AVOID THE DEPTH CHARGES OR WATCH IN BAFFLEMENT AS THE ESCORTS LEFT A BIG GAP FOR A FEW BOATS TO EXPLOIT HE SAID IT WAS BETTER THAN ANY SUBMARINE MOVIE HE'S EVER WATCHED

HE GOT A LOT OF EXERCISE THOUGH AS WE HAD THE ESCORTS CONVOY SET UP ON A MAP UPSTAIRS AND THE SUBMARINES HAD THEIR OWN MAP DOWNSTAIRS YOU KNOW FOR AUTHENTICITY
FOR ME IT'S MERCHANT OF VENUS I PLAYED THE FIRST EDITION A LOT AND NOW PLAY THE SECOND GOOD ECONOMIC GAME WITH DIFFERENT ROUTES EACH TIME
OGRE I'VE OWNED AND PLAYED VARIOUS VERSIONS OF IT SINCE THE AND STILL PLAY MY DE VERSION REGULARLY WITH ALL THE EXPANSIONS
RA AND PUERTO RICO ARE MY TWO I'VE OWNED LONGEST THAT I'VE PLAYED THE MOST THE RA IS A EDITION AND THE PUERTO RICO IS THE RELEASE YEAR ONE I OWN GLORY TO ROME AS WELL WHICH IS AS OLD AS PUERTO RICO BUT I ONLY ACQUIRED IT A FEW YEARS AGO I STILL PLAY ALL THREE A TON
SURPRISINGLY LORDS OF WATERDEEP AND ITS EXPANSION REMAINS AT THE TOP OF MY MOST PLAYED TILL DATE I'VE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE DISMISS IT AS A SIMPLE WORKER PLACEMENT GAME BUT THE SCOPE FOR DEVIOUSNESS FROM THE BASE GAME ITSELF HAS MADE IT A HIT

AND THE USUAL EUROS SUCH AS CONCORDIA CASTLES LA ISLA TERRA MYSTIC ALCHEMISTS ETC WILL ALL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME
FOR ME CARCASSONNE AND SMALL WORLD HAVE BOTH BECOME STAPLES IN MY COLLECTION CARCASSONNE LIT MY INCREST IN BOARDGAMES YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST GOT IT I THINK IT WAS AROUND AND SMALL WORLD IS STILL POPULAR IN MY GROUPS DESPITE IT BEING IN MY COLLECTION SINCE ITS RELEASE
DOES BIBLIOG COUNT IT OFFERS DEEPER GAMEPLAY THAN FOR SALE AND VERY UNIQUE AND STREAMLINED MECHANICS

ALWAYS GLAD TO INTRODUCE IT TO NEW PLAYERS
SURVIVE STILL COMES OUT REGULARLY ESPECIALLY DURING THE HOLIDAYS IT'S BEEN ON MY SHELF FOR A LONG TIME THE GAME ITSELF IS SLIGHTLY OLDER THAN ME

CITADELS ONE OF THE FIRST MODERN BOARD GAMES I PURCHASED AND IS STILL A GREAT GAME VERY EXCITED FOR THE NEW EDITION
THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNGSTERS ON HERE

WHILE I HAVE REPLACED THE ELEMENTS TWICE SINCE EMPIRE BUILDER IS STILL A REGULAR HERE MY WIFE AND I WILL PLAY IT AS A GAME AND BE WITHIN A FEW DOLLARS OF EACHOTHER IN THE LAST TURN REGULARLY ALSO GOOD FOR NEW GAMERS SIMPLE RULES BOATLOADS TRAINLOADS OF TACTICAL THOUGHT FUN GAME
ZOMBICIDE IT WAS AN EARLY FAVORITE IN MY GROUP AND EVEN AS WE HAVE GROWN AND EXPANDED OUR INTERESTS IN THE HOBBY THIS DICE CHUCKING MINI FILLED SPECTACLE ALWAYS MANAGES TO RETURN TO THE TABLE
IT HAS TO BE WONDERS FOR OUR GROUP WHILE IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY ON MY SHELF ANYMORE I REPLACED IT WITH AMONG THE STARS I DONATED IT TO A MEMBER OF MY GAMING GROUP WHO LOVES IT AND IT STILL COMES OUT REGULARLY IT'S MOST LIKELY TO BE PLAYED IF WE HAVE A LARGE GROUP OR ARE AT THE END OF A NIGHT AND WANTING TO WIND DOWN

MOST OFTEN PLAYED WITH THE LEADERS EXPANSION I TEND TO BE AN ADVOCATE OF TOO MANY EXPANSIONS SPOIL WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT THE GAME SO IT'S USUALLY THAT OR CITIES BABEL HAS YET TO BE PURCHASED AND I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE GAME NOW WILL PICK IT UP
THAT WOULD BE CATAN STILL THE GAME THAT I PLAYED THE MOST AND OVER THE LONGEST AMOUNT OF TIME WE EVEN HAD A WEEKLY MEET UP JUST TO PLAY THE GAME WE WERE A LITTLE OBSESSED
BEEN IN THE HOBBY LESS THAN TWO YEARS BUT GAMES I'VE OWNED FOR A WHILE THAT STILL GET PLAYED FAIRLY REGULARLY ARE KEYFLOWER HIVE HIVE POCKET AND CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG CARCASSONNE AND TICKET TO RIDE AS WELL BUT THAT'S LARGELY DEPENDENT ON WHO I'M PLAYING WITH
I THINK PANDEMIC HAS DEFINITELY GOTTEN THE MOST PLAYS OUT OF ANY GAME I OWN BASICALLY EVERYONE I TEACH IT TO WANTS TO PLAY IT AT LEAST ONCE WHENEVER WE PLAY GAMES
THE FIRST MODERN BOARD GAME I BOUGHT WAS CARCASSONNE WHICH I STILL PLAY AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH

THE OLDEST OF MY GAMES IS ROLL FOR THE GALAXY I HAVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT MONTHS IT WAS MY GAME LAST YEAR AND WILL LIKELY BE MY MOST PLAYED THIS YEAR TOO IT HAS TWICE THE PLAYS OF MOST OTHERS
ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS I PICKED IT UP FOR CHEAP AT A COMIC FAIR BATTERED BOX AND ALL ORIGINAL NOT THE RE-RELEASE IT JUST KEEPS COMING OUT GRANDPARENTS AND CHILLERS ALIKE LOVE IT I'M GETTING A BIT BITTER THAT THE BARGAIN GETS MORE PLAYS THAN THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONES MICE AND MYSTICS DIED IN THE WATER
HIVE ZENDO AND SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH THE VERY LIGHT-WEIGHT SPOT IT
FIRST GAME THAT I'VE BOUGHT AND PLAYED BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA STILL SEE PLAYS IT CONVEYS THE TENSE FEELING OF THE SHOW SO WELL


IT'S THE BEST HIDDEN TRAITOR GAME EVER MADE
THE GAME IVE HAD LONGEST WITHOUT LOOSING IS ROBO RALLY 1ST EDITION I LOVED THIS GAME SO MUCH BEFORE THE MODERN WAVE OF BOARD GAMES KICKED IN I REMEMBER MAKING A DRINKING GAME OUT OF IT AND OKAYING ON NYE BUT IT COMES OUT PRETTY RARELY NOW

THE OLDEST STILL LOVED GAME IS CARCASSONNE IT CONES OUT MORE CONSISTENTLY THEN ANY OTHER GAME I OWN AND IS THE EASIEST TO TEACH I LOVE THE EXPANSIONS BUT RARELY USE THEM BECAUSE IM FREQUENTLY PLAYING WITH ATLEAST BEGINNER

EDIT FORMATTING
I'VE PLAYED BOTH MY FAVORITE GAMES OVER OR TIMES THE GREAT ZIMBABWE AND AGE OF STEAM OTHER EVERGREENS HANAFI DELUXE DIAMANT CAN PLAY WITH KIDS AS YOUNG AS DIXIT ODYSSEY PELOPONNESE POWER GRID AND SPLENDOR
REGARDING RATINGS AND HYPE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S YOUR OWN THOUGHTS THAT REALLY MATTER IT'S THE SAME FOR WHEN YOU CHECK OUT VIDEO GAME MOVIE AND OTHER FORMS OF MEDIAS REVIEWS AND HYPE THAT FOLLOWS ALONG WITH IT SO AS LONG AS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT IN GAMES AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN HYPE OR YOU COULD SIMPLY IGNORE IT

BUT TO REFER GAMES WE KIND OF NEED TO KNOW GAMES THAT YOU'VE LIKED SO FAR I COULD SIT HERE AND NAME GAMES THAT ARE VERY FAR APART BUT I HAVE NO IDEA IF YOU'LL ACTUALLY ENJOY THEM I'D HATE TO BE THAT GUY THAT RECOMMENDS GAMES THAT JUST GATHER DUST ON YOUR SHELVES
WELL YOU SEEM SET ON DECK BUILDERS FOR THE TIME BEING

FIRST AND FOREMOST I'LL JUST SAY RIGHT NOW THAT TICKET TO RIDE AND PANDEMIC HAVE A PLACE IN JUST ABOUT ANY COLLECTION AS FOR SOME OF MY FAVORITES THAT SCRATCH A DIFFERENT ITCH

ALCHEMISTS IS MY FAVORITE GAME IT DEFINITELY IS NOT FOR EVERYONE AS IT IS A CONSIDERABLY HEAVIER WORKER PLACEMENT GAME THAN LORDS OF WATERDEEP BUT IF YOU LIKE DOING LOGIC PUZZLES THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU

SEASONS IS JUST A BEAUTIFUL GAME CARD DRAFTING AND DICE DRAFTING YOU'LL BE CHECKING OUT THE CARDS LOOKING FOR KILLER COMBOS IN NO TIME

FIVE TRIBES IS MANCALA ON STEROIDS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT

DEAD OF WINTER IS A GREAT GAME THAT ACTUALLY GIVES THE TRAITOR ACTUAL CHOICES WITHOUT EASILY GIVING THEMSELVES AWAY ONLY ZOMBIE GAME I OWN AND I'M OK WITH THAT

LEVEL OMEGA PROTOCOL IS AN AWESOME DUNGEON CRAWL IT WOULD BE A REPEAT THEME FOR YOU MARINES MOWING DOWN ALIENS BUT IT PLAYS VERY DIFFERENT FROM LEGENDARY

TRAGEDY LOOPER IS JUST A VERY DIFFERENT GAME COMBINE GROUNDHOGS DAY WITH QUANTUM LEAP IT'S ANOTHER VS ALL GAME THAT IS TOUGH TO GET TO THE TABLE AT FIRST ONCE YOU GET A SOLID GROUP OF THOUGH IT'S A GREAT TIME THE FIRST FEW LOOPS THE HEROES ARE TRYING TO DEDUCE WHAT THE SCENARIO IS AND WHO THE KEY PLAYERS ARE ONCE THEY FIGURE OUT MOST OF THE INFO IT BECOMES A CHESS MATCH TRYING TO OUTMANEUVER THE OPPOSING SIDE

SPECTER OPS IS BASICALLY METAL GEAR SOLID IN A BOX YET ANOTHER VS ALL SORRY IN A ROW THIS ONE IS ALL ABOUT THE HIDDEN MOVEMENT AND USING SPECIAL ABILITIES AT THE RIGHT TIME

ABOUT RATINGS I SOMEWHAT AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THE AVERAGE SHOULD BE AND I OFTEN FEEL AS PEOPLE USE TO REPRESENT AVERAGE BUT EVERYONE DO THERE OWN THINGS I GUESS THE HYPE CAN GET KIND OF HIGH ESPECIALLY ON UNPROVEN KICKSTARTER GAMES BUT BECAUSE OF THIS WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF AWESOME GAMES THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY IF CROWDSOURCING WAS NOT AVAILABLE


AS FOR GAMES I SUGGEST THAT YOU TRY A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAMES BEFORE YOU START SPENDING TO MUCH MONEY SOME GAMES TO TRY THAT I LIKE TICKET TO RIDE A LIGHT GAME THAT CAN BE A REALLY GOOD GATEWAY GAME HANSA TEUTONIA THIS HAS A BIT MORE TO DO AND THINK ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITES CHICAGO EXPRESS A LIGHTER ECONOMIC STOCK HOLDING GAME ANTIAE II NICE AND SIMPLE GAME ARKWRIGHT HEAVY ECONOMIC GAME RAILWAYS ROBBER BARONS HEAVY ECONOMIC STOCK MANIPULATION GAME THROUGH THE AGES A NEW STORY OF CIVILIZATION HEAVY GAME WITHOUT A MAP
RIGHT AS FOR THE PSIG PART I HAVE CODENAMES LE ALIEN FAVOURITE GAME SO FAR STAR REALMS LORDS OF DEEPWATER AND ASCENSION TO START MY COLLECTION I WANT TO HAVE A LARGE VARIETY OF GAMES TO PLAY MECHANICALLY AND THEMATICALLY SO CAN ANYONE SUGGEST GAMES THAT ARE AS FAR AWAY FROM THOSE LISTED ABOVE AS POSSIBLE

MOST OF US WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA BUYING A HUGE VARIETY OF GAMES RIGHT AWAY INTO THE HOBBY IS HOW MANY PEOPLE END UP INVESTING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS EARLY INTO THE HOBBY AND FINDING OUT LATER THAT THEY HATE WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES OR THEY HATE GAMES THAT TAKE LONGER THAN 2 HOURS OR ANY OTHER NUMBER OF QUALIFICATIONS WE REGULARLY GIVE THE SAME ADVICE TO NEWIES

GO OUT AND PLAY GAMES AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU LIKE GO TO METUMPS AND BE WILLING TO PLAY ANYTHING GO DEMO GAMES AT YOUR FAGS WATCH VIDEOS ABOUT GAMES OR MECHANICS THAT INTEREST YOU AND SEE IF YOU CAN TRY BEFORE YOU BUY KEEP TRACK OF THE GAMES THAT YOU LIKE THE GAMES THAT YOU HATE AND THE GAMES THAT ARE JUST OK THINK ABOUT WHY YOU LIKE THE GAMES THAT YOU LIKE

SECONDLY PLEASE FOLLOW THE ADVICE IN THE WIKI ABOUT PSIG POSTS

WE HAVE NO HOPE OF SUGGESTING GAMES FOR YOU TO PURCHASE JUST BASED ON A LIST OF FIVE GAMES HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU PLAY WITH WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE GAME WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THE GAMES YOU OWN WHAT DON'T YOU LIKE ARE YOU WILLING TO PLAY ANY THEME DOES THE GAME NEED TO HAVE AN INTENSE THEME BY JUST SAYING PSIG THAT'S NOT ANY OF THESE FIVE GAMES PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SUGGEST THEIR FAVORITE RANDOM GAME MOST LIKELY AND NOT GIVE ANYTHING THAT HAS SUBSTANCE IF YOU ONLY PLAY GAMES WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND 2 PLAYER GAMES ARE DIFFERENT THAN PLAYER GAMES IF YOU MOSTLY PLAY WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT LIMITS WHICH GAMES WOULD BE SUGGESTED

SECONDLY AS THIS IS CLEARLY A VERY POSITIVE COMMUNITY THIS PART MAKES SENSE BUT YOU GUYS NEED A FILTER HAHA WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS THAT HYPE CAN KINDA GET OUTTA HAND I GET IT YOU LIKE THIS GAME BUT NOT EVERY GAME YOU PLAY CAN BE OR BETTER I THINK PERHAPS WE COULD ALL START THINKING ABOUT FLAWS IN GAMES WE LOVE AND THINKING OF A MORE BALANCED OPINION AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO KILL ENTHUSIASM BUT UNDERSTANDING WHY A GAME I LOVE MIGHT IN A FAIRER LIGHT BE A HELPS LET YOU GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS WHILE ADDRESS POTENTIAL ISSUES I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT WITH THE VARIETY OF GAMES OUT THERE IT'S HARD TO LOOK AT GAMES IN A SOMEWHAT OBJECTIVE LIGHT BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE HERE GIVE A GAME LESS THAN A AND IS AVERAGE

YOU REALIZE THAT PEOPLE GENERALLY ONLY SUGGEST GAMES THAT THEY GASP REALLY THINK ARE SWELL GAMES THAT PEOPLE SUGGEST ARE IN GENERAL GOING TO HAVE A SEMI DECENT RATING BECAUSE NOBODY GOES OUT AND SUGGESTS A GAME THAT THEY DON'T LIKE UNLESS IT'S A SPECIFIC NEED I DON'T LOVE SPLENDOR BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT WITH MY TASTES BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S A BAD GAME

WHAT RATINGS ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT DO YOU MEAN IN THE TOP TEN LIST IN THE SIDEBAR DO YOU MEAN ON BG

THE TOP TEN LIST IN THE SIDEBAR ARE THE GAMES THAT THIS SUBREDDIT RATES THE MOST HIGHLY ON BG THE HIGHEST GAME ON THE TOP TEN LIST IS AN WHICH DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT WE'RE RATING GAMES AT AN AVERAGE OF A IN ADDITION WHEN IT COMES TO GAMES THAT I RATE FOR MY PERSONAL COLLECTION I'M MORE LIKELY TO BE RATING GAMES THAT I LIKE BECAUSE AT THIS POINT I GENERALLY KNOW WHAT TYPES OF GAMES THAT I LIKE I KNEW THAT I'D ENJOY SCYTHE BEFORE I PLAYED IT BECAUSE I LOVE AREA CONTROL GAMES AND I LOVE ENGINE BUILDING RACE TYPE GAMES LIKE ISTANBUL

IF YOU'RE TALKING BG
I'M LOOKING AT MY ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW OF THE GAMES I HAVE RATED AT THE CURRENT MOMENT OF THEM ARE A OR LOWER AGAIN AT THIS POINT THE LONGER I'M IN THE HOBBY I EXPECT TO HAVE LESS AND LESS LOW SCORES NOT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T GAMES THAT ARE BAD I HAVE GAMES THAT ARE RATED AS AND LOWER BUT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME OR MONEY IN THE WORLD FOR ME TO PLAY EVERY GAME AND I'D RATHER PRIORITIZE PLAYING GAMES THAT I KNOW THAT I'LL LOVE

IN ADDITION RATINGS ON BG ACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING BEYOND A SEVEN IS BETTER THAN A SIX

OUTSTANDING ALWAYS WANT TO PLAY EXPECT THIS WILL NEVER CHANGE

EXCELLENT ALWAYS WANT TO PLAY

VERY GOOD LIKE TO PLAY WILL PROBABLY SUGGEST IT WILL NEVER TURN IT DOWN

GOOD USUALLY WILLING TO PLAY

FAIR SOME FUN OR CHALLENGE AT LEAST WILL PLAY OCCASIONALLY IF IN THE RIGHT MOOD

AVERAGE NO SIGNIFICANT APPEAL TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT

BELOW AVERAGE SLIGHTLY BORING COULD BE TALKED INTO IT ON OCCASION

POOR LIKELY WON'T PLAY THIS AGAIN ALTHOUGH COULD BE CONVINCED

2 VERY POOR ANNOYING I PLAN TO NEVER PLAY THIS AGAIN

DEFIES DESCRIPTION OF A GAME YOU WON'T CATCH ME DEAD PLAYING THIS CLEARLY BROKEN

EDIT SORRY IF I SOUND LIKE A GRUMPY JERK BUT MY BIGGEST PET PEEVE IS PEOPLE WHO TREAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THEIR OPINION IS WRONG ALL OPINIONS ARE SUBJECTIVE AND OTHER THAN GAMES THAT ARE INHERENTLY BROKEN THERE'S NO WRONG OPINION WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT GAMES YOU LIKE IF SOMEONE THINKS THAT RACE FOR THE GALAXY IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD AND I WOULD RATHER TAKE A NAP THAN PLAY IT NEITHER OF OUR OPINIONS ARE WRONG PEOPLE VALUE DIFFERENT THINGS IN GAMES AND THAT'S OK THAT'S WHY WE LEARN TO EXPRESS WHAT WE LIKE AND DON'T LIKE IN GAMES SO THAT WE CAN TARGET GAMES THAT WE WILL ENJOY
FUNNY STORY THIS APPARENTLY GOT A LOT OF PLAY AT SPRING AND HAS BECOME A THING THAT PEOPLE SEEK OUT AND PLAY AT BG CONSONANT I'M THE REASON THAT THIS IS IN THE BG LIBRARY I BROUGHT IT TO THE CONVENTION TO SELL IN THE FLEA MARKET IN OR WHEN IT DIDN'T SELL AND LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE A PERENNIAL CLUNKER I JUST DISCREETLY FILED IT AWAY IN THE LIBRARY THE CONVENTION COMMITTEE FOUND IT THE NEXT YEAR WHEN INVENTORYING AND ADDED A BARCONE TO IT TO CHECK OUT

I'M NOT SURE HOW IT BECAME A THING THAT PEOPLE PLAY BUT I WAS REALLY SURPRISED TO SEE IT ON THE HOT LIST SCREEN AT
STRANGE ENOUGH MY GRANDMOTHER JUST GAVE ME A COPY OF THIS GAME LAST WEEKEND HADN'T EVEN HEARD IF THE GAME PRIOR
HERE YOU CAN WATCH THE AUTHOR OF THE FAULT IN OUR STARS DRUNKENLY PLAY THE GAME
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT I'M TALKING TO A RUG
WHY IS THIS SUDDENLY A THING THIS WAS ON THE TOP LIST FOR BG CON

CLIP FROM LADY VENGEANCE
WATCH V EQOHVQYKNXW

GREAT MOVIE
TITLE

THIRD PART OF THE VENGEANCE TRILOGY
WIKI

SORRY COMMENT IS OFF TOPIC BUT I JUST GOT EXCITED SEEING A CLIP FROM THE MOVIE
I'M SCARED TO WATCH THE REAL CLIP OF THE MOVIE BUT I NEED TO KNOW WHY DO THEY ALL GO NUTS AND START CRYING
ITEMS IN THE GAME THAT GIVE STRAIGHT-UP POINTS ANIMALS OCCUPATIONS BOATS THING PENALTIES ETC INDICATE THE POINTS WITH A SHIELD ICON THE NUMBERS ON BLUE TILES DON'T HAVE A DIFFERENT ICON AND ARE IN A DIFFERENT TYPEFACE BECAUSE THEY SERVE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE
YEAH IT'S RIGHT SAYS IT RIGHT THERE IN THE RULES AT THE END WHAT YOU SCORE POINTS FOR THE BLUE TILES ARE JUST BETTER BECAUSE YOU CAN PLACE THEM NEXT TO EACH OTHER

2 NUMBERS ON THE TREASURE BLUE TILES ARE SWORD VALUE COST FOR PILLAGING RAIDING AND MONEY VALUE COST FOR BUYING USING BUYING ACTION SPACE NUMBER ON BLUE TILES IS FOR SWORD VALUE FOR RAIDING PILLAGING

A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME YOU GET POINTS FOR THE BLUE AND TREASURE TILES JUST HAVE TO SAY AT THE START THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND IT'S ALL GOOD
I'VE NOW PLAYED A GOOD HANDFUL OF GAMES WITH SCORES RANGING FROM YEAH YOU READ THAT RIGHT UP TO BOTH SOLO AND MULTIPLAYER THE KEY SCORING IN THE GAME IS ALWAYS GETTING RID OF THOSE NEGATIVE POINT VALUES ON YOUR HOME BOARD AND ANY EXPLORATION OR HOUSE SHED BOARDS YOU MAY HAVE PICKED UP THOSE CAN ADD UP FAST YOU DON'T NEED TO COVER THEM ALL BUT YOU NEED TO DO YOUR BEST AND THAT'S WHAT GREEN AND BLUE TILES ARE ALL ABOUT IN SOME CASES RED AND ORANGE TILES CAN BE USED BUT BLUE IS ALWAYS THE MOST VALUABLE TYPE OF TILE BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS THE MOST FLEXIBLE FOR COVERING THESE NEGATIVES

OTHERWISE YEAH NO VALUE TO THE TILES THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF SCORING
I'VE HAD THE OPPOSITE EXPERIENCE IT'S PLAYED MORE THAN EVER AT MY GAME GROUP I'VE PLAYED IT PERSONALLY TIMES AND IT'S STILL AS EXCELLENT AS IT WAS THE FIRST EXCEPT YOU KNOW THE SURPRISE OF HOW AWESOME IT WAS GOING TO BE THE GROUP AS A WHOLE HAS PLAYED IT PROBABLY AN ADDITIONAL TIMES AND EVERYONE IS STILL INTERESTED

DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT FOR THE MOST PART THAT GROUP PLAYS STUFF TIMES AND THEN IT FALLS TO THE SIDE FOR WHATEVER IS NEW PLAYS IS HUGE
I'VE PLAYED IT FOR AN ENTIRE NIGHT WITH A GROUP OF ALL NEW TO THE GAME A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS

THE FIRST TWO GAMES WE WERE NOT ADHERING TO THE DOUBLE CHECK RULE VERY STRICTLY THE CAPTAIN HAS TO ANNOUNCE HIS ORDER THEN THE FIRST MATE AND THE ENGINEER HAVE TO CONFIRM THIS SHOULD HAVE LEAD TO A RHYTHM OF GO NORTH CHECK CHECK GO WEST CHECK CHECK IN REALITY EVERYONE WAS VERY EAGER TO GO AS FAST AS POSSIBLE NEW ORDERS WERE SHOUTED BEFORE THE LAST ONES WERE CONFIRMED AND THE RADIO OPERATORS WERE LOST AFTER THREE COMMANDS DID HE GET A DOUBLE VERIFICATION ON THAT LAST ONE WAS THAT A REAL MOVE OR DID YOU JUST CHANGE IT BEFORE THE ENGINEER VERIFIED IT ETC
ALSO THE OTHER ROLES WERE SHOUTING AND LOUDLY ANNOUNCING EVERYTHING THEY WERE THINKING THIS DIDN'T HELP FOR CLARITY EITHER SURE YOU CAN HAVE LOADS OF FUN SHOUTING AND JOSTLING AT EACH OTHER BUT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME IT'S NO FUN IF THE RADIO OPERATOR IS IN THE DARK FOR OF THE TIME BECAUSE OF RADIO INTERFERENCE
THEREFORE WE TOOK A TIME-OUT AND RECHECKED THE RULES WE TOOK TO HEART THE CLEAR ORDER STRUCTURE AND BESIDES ORDERS FROM FIRST MATE AND CAPTAIN AND CONFIRMATIONS FROM FIRST MATE AND ENGINEER THERE WAS TO BE WHISPERED INSTEAD OF TALKED AT NORMAL VOLUME THIS GREATLY IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF THE GAMES FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING
ALSO SURFACING OR STOP MEANS PENCILS DOWN AND HANDS CLEAR FROM THE BOARD TOO
ONCE YOU ESTABLISH THIS CHAIN OF COMMAND AND PROCEDURE THE LAME ROLE OF FIRST MATE JUST CROSS OFF STUFF AND ANNOUNCE READY BECOMES MUCH MORE INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT IF YOU CAN'T SPEAK OUT LOUD ALL THE TIME THE FIRST MATE IS ALSO BECAUSE OF THE SEATING ARRANGEMENT THE CONNECTOR BETWEEN THE SYSTEMS AND THE CAPTAIN THE ROLE ALLOWS FOR LOOKING AT THE CAPTAINS SHEET FOR POSSIBLE WEAPON USE AND AT THE ENGINEERS SHEET FOR ADVICE TO REPAIR CERTAIN SYSTEMS AND GOOD CAPTAINS AND ENGINEERS TRUST THEIR FIRST MATES
THE RADIO OPERATOR HAS THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD ROLE JUST LISTEN AND TAKE NOTE AND INFORM THE CAPTAIN EVERYHOW AND THEN
I FOUND THE ROLE OF CAPTAIN MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN I THOUGHT AT FIRST YOU HAVE TO ORDER WEAPONS TO BE READY ON TIME BUT ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHERE YOUR ENEMY IS AND YOU NEED TO RELY ON YOUR FIRST MATE AND ENGINEER TO KEEP SYSTEMS UP AND RUNNING SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T DO MUCH ABOUT A SITUATION AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE LUCKILY STOP AND SURFACE ALLOWS FOR A BREATHER
AS I SAID THE FIRST MATE IS AN INTERESTING ROLE AND SLIGHTLY LESS STRESSFUL THAN BEING CAPTAIN BASICALLY THE FIRST MATE IS THE COMMUNICATOR ASK THE CAPTAIN WHAT HE NEEDS NEXT AND MANAGE IT WITH THE ENGINEER
THE ENGINEER HAS THE PUZZLERS ROLE IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE TO USE THE ERASE DAMAGE SYSTEM THE BEST YOU CAN YOU CONSTANTLY HAVE TO UPDATE THE FIRST MATE ON THE STATUS OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD DIRECTION TO GO NEXT

I'D LOVE TO PLAY IT AGAIN BUT ONLY WITH A GROUP WILLING TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF RULES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE GAMEPLAY

I LEARNED I DON'T HAVE SIX FRIENDS I THOUGHT I DID BUT I GUESS I DON'T
I THINK IT'S EXCELLENT IT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING IN MY COLLECTION AND IS DEFINITELY PLAYABLE IN THE PLAYER RANGE SO DON'T THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO MAKE IT SHINE I'VE PLAYED IT WITH AND IT'S DEVOLVED INTO A LOUD CHAOTIC CRAPSHOOT BUT WITH GAMERS IT'S A SLOWER MORE TENSE TACTICAL AFFAIR THAT'S GREAT
I'VE FOUND THAT CAN BE REALLY IMPACTING IN THE GAME AND AFFECT THE FUN LEVEL

BUT I'M STILL ENJOYING IT
MUCH LIKE ANY GAME IF YOU PLAY IT A MILLION TIMES YOU'LL LIKELY GET SICK OF IT BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY ARGUE IT WASN'T A GOOD GAME OR YOU DIDN'T HAVE FUN IF YOU PLAYED IT A MILLION TIMES PERSONALLY I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT IN OVER A MONTH AND A HALF BUT I THINK WE ARE JUST TRYING NOT TO PLAY IT TOO OFTEN PLUS YOU REALLY NEED PEOPLE TO PLAY IT PROPERLY WHICH IS SOMETIMES HARD TO GET AT THE TABLE
I FIND IT ODD THAT YOU ARE SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT PLAYING THIS GAME IN A CONVENTION SETTING IN MY EXPERIENCE LOUD INVOLVED GAMES AS USUALLY THE ONES THAT ATTRACT INTEREST AND MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY IN THOSE SETTINGS EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
PLAYED IT AS AND BOTH AS ALTERNATING TURNS EVERY PLAY WAS A TENSE FUN EXPERIENCE NO REGRETS
I'VE FOUND THE GAME TO BE QUITE GOOD DURING I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY IT WITH AS A REAL-TIME GAME AND AS A GAME BOTH WAYS I FOUND IT TO BE GREAT THE LEVEL OF TENSION WITH TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM AND BETTER THAN THE OTHER TEAM IS JUST FANTASTIC QUITE SATISFYING TO LET FLY A TORPEDO AND LAND THAT DIRECT HIT BECAUSE TO GET TO THAT POINT YOU HAD TO WORK AS A TEAM AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU SYSTEMS WERE GREEN YOU WERE CLOSE ENOUGH YOU KNOW WHERE THEY WERE ETC IS ALSO INTENSE AS IT'S ALL UP TO YOU TO JUST TRY AND YOUR OPPONENT YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED TO PLAN AND IT'S A GOOD SORT OF TERRIFYING TO REALIZE THAT YOUR OPPONENT COULD BE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU AND READY TO FIRE

IT'S A GOOD GAME
MY LOVE FOR IT STILL HASN'T SUNK EVERYTIME THIS GAMES SURFACES IT IS LIKE DIRECT HIT FROM A TORPEDO FULL OF EXCITEMENT I WILL INCREASE PRESSURE ON MY FRIENDS TO KEEP PLAYING THIS

I'LL LET MYSELF OUT

BUT NOT BEFORE I TELL YOU THAT INDEED IT MIGHT BE MORE OF A GROUP GAME AND I INDEED LEAD IN THE GAME BY MENTIONING THAT WHILE SIMPLE AND LOTS OF FUN IT IS A STRESSFUL GAME WITH LOTS OF INFORMATION GOING ON HASN'T LEAD TO DISAPPOINTMENT BUT AGAIN I ONLY PLAY WITH THE SAME GROUPS AND NEVER WHERE OTHER PEOPLE ARE BOTHERED
THIS GAME WAS A HIT WITH MY GROUP IT'S NOT FAVORITE GAME BUT IT'S A GAME WE ALL LOVE IT FILLS A VERY NICE HOLE IN OUR COLLECTION IT'S REFRESHING TO PLAY ONCE IN AWHILE IN BETWEEN HEAVY EUROS
MY GAME GROUP DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT SO I BROUGHT IT TO WORK IT'S SUCH A GOOD TEAM BUILDING GAME WE NOW PLAY IT EVERY TWO FRIDAYS AND EVERYONE LOVES IT
BROUGHT IT INTO THE OFFICE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER I BOUGHT IT AND WE'VE PLAYED ONCE A WEEK FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS FULL PLAYER GAMES WE SWITCH UP THE TEAMS AND ROLES IT'S STILL GREAT DON'T FORGET TO TURN ON YOUR SOUND EFFECTS WE STILL DO THIS EVERY TIME

IT'S ONLY MADE IT BACK TO THE HOME TABLE ONCE THOUGH SINCE THE FIRST WEEK I THINK THIS IS MOSTLY DUE TO OTHER GAMES BEING MORE POPULAR WITH THE GIRLFRIEND
MY GROUP LOVES IT THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN HUNTING OR BEING HUNTED BY LIVING OPPONENTS WAY DIFFERENT THAN SOME MADE UP STAT OR DICE ROLL OR CARD OR MECHANIC
CAPTAIN SONAR REALLY STANDS OUT AS A TEAM GAME WHICH SOUNDS AMAZING I JUST NEED TO WORK OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE I COULD GET TO PLAY AND ENJOY AND ALSO HOW FEW WOULD PLAY AND STILL ENJOY IT

A GAME ABOUT SYSTEMS AND COMMUNICATION AND ORGANIZATION SOUNDS AMAZING FUN TO ME OF COURSE I READ THESE SORTS OF REPORTS TO LEARN THE CONTEXTS WHERE IT CAN SHINE MERELY WORK OR ELSE FALL SHORT
I'M STILL LOVING IT BUT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD FOR ME TO GET TO THAT TABLE
LOVE IT BUT I COULD SEE HOW PLAYING IT IN A PUBLIC PLACE WOULD BE AWKWARD OR UNCOMFORTABLE IT'S A PARTY GAME THAT FORCES YOU TO THINK SO IT'S FOUND A SOLID NICHE IN MY COLLECTION HARD TO CHECK BOTH THOSE BOXES BUT CAPTAIN SONAR DOES SO VERY WELL
I LIKE IT BUT I SEE MYSELF BECOMING ATTACHED TO CERTAIN ROLLS

ALSO WE JUST HAD 2 GAMES OF THIS GOING ON IN THE SAME ROOM AND THERE WAS TALK OF FINDING A WAY TO TEAM IT WE FIGURED THE RADIO OPERATORS JUST NEEDED DIFFERENT COLOR MARKERS
I'VE PLAYED WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS AND I HAVE NOT HEARD AN OPEN DISLIKE FOR IT SO THAT HAS TO COUNT FOR SOMETHING I HAVE HEARD SEVERAL I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE THIS BUT ITS COMPLIMENTARY PHRASE HERE

I WISH I GOT TO PLAY IT MORE BUT OFTEN IT'S HARD TO GET AVAILABLE TO PLAY AT THE SAME TIME EVEN AT LARGE GATHERINGS BECAUSE IF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY BROKEN INTO GROUPS FROM A PREVIOUS GAME ALL GROUPS END AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND USUALLY START SOMETHING ELSE

PEOPLE IN MY METUMPS ACTIVELY ASK FOR ME TO BRING IT EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T ALWAYS GET PLAYED
I FEEL THE EXACT OPPOSITE I'VE PLAYED ROUGHLY TIMES NOW AND THE LAST TIME I PLAYED IT WAS BY FAR THE MOST INTENSE CONSIDERING IT WAS WELL OVER A MINUTE LONG GAME WITH ONE MINUTE SECTION OF IT BEING A CRAZY DOG FIGHT IN A SINGLE SECTION WITH US SHOOTING BACK AND FORTH AND SOMEHOW MISSING WHILE DODGING MINES AT THE SAME TIME

IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE AT MY NEETUP GROUP KIND OF WANT TO DO A WEEKLY TOURNAMENT SEASON OF GAMES WITH TEAMS
I WAS AFRAID OF THE NOVELTY WEARING OFFICIAL THE LONGER I WAIT TO BUY IT THE MORE I FIND MYSELF REALIZING THERE ARE OTHER GAMES I'D SOONER BUY WILL PROBABLY GET IT EVENTUALLY THOUGH SINCE MY HASN'T BUDGED AN INCH SINCE SHE'D HEARD OF IT
I HAD A LOT OF FUN PLAYING IT AT A LOCAL CONVENTION BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE IT HAS A VERY NARROW AUDIENCE
I'VE PLAYED CAPTAIN SONAR TIMES NOW AND I FIND IT FALLS INTO A PRETTY PREDICTABLE RHYTHM ONE OF THE CAPTAINS RECORDED SEVERAL MOVING PATTERNS THAT MAXIMIZE THE ENGINEER'S EFFICIENCY AND PASSED THESE AROUND TO OTHER CAPTAINS THERE'S STILL A LOT OF FUN IN PLAYING BUT FOR ME IT'S A GAME I'LL PLAY BUT NOT SUGGEST
ABSOLUTELY LOATHED AND DESPISED BY MUCH OF MY GROUP MORE THAN ANY GAME EVER CREATED

I SORT OF LIKED IT BUT IT'S THE ONLY GAME IN OUR GROUP THAT ANYONE HAS QUIT FROM HATING IT AND IT WAS AT THE DEMAND OF MULTIPLE PLAYERS

BASICALLY TWO OR THREE PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY COULDN'T STAND THE CHAOS OF THE GAME AND THE POSSIBLE MISTAKES THAT CAME FROM PLAYING IN REAL TIME PEOPLE KEPT SCREAMING THAT WE MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE BECAUSE THAT TORPEDO SHOULD HAVE BEEN A HIT GOD DAMMIT THEY MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN OUR SILENCE MOVES THEY WERE ALSO VERY FRUSTRATED AT TRYING TO HEAR THE MOVES AS THEY WERE BEING CALLED OUT OUR ORDERS ME AND THE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEIR CAPTAIN AND THEIR ENGINEER ABOUT WHAT THEY COULD DO

IT WAS EVEN MORE STRIKING BECAUSE THE TWO FOLKS WHO INSISTED ON QUITTING WOULD USUALLY PLAY ANYTHING FROM TIC TAC TOE TO MEGA CIVILIZATION AND LOVE WHATEVER WAS PLAYED

THE REAL TIME CHAOS POSSIBLE MISTAKES AND IMPRECISION JUST DON'T WORK FOR SOME GROUPS I CAN ATTEST
TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE GAMES THAT I REALLY LIKE BUT WILL PROBABLY NEVER PLAY IT SOUNDS SO COOL BUT I JUST CAN'T SEE MYSELF BEING VERY SUCCESSFUL PLAYING IT TOO MUCH GOING ON ALL AT ONCE
IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE I PLAY WITH WILL EVER PLAY IT
I'VE POSTED MY THOUGHTS BEFORE WHICH I MAINTAIN PERSONALLY

THE ROLE OF THE CAPTAIN IS SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT THE MOST DIFFICULT THE CAPTAIN NEEDS TO BE DECISIVE AND COMMUNICATE WELL BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE AND I'VE BEEN CAPTAIN TIMES AND ENGINEER ONCE THE BEST CAPTAINS NEED TO BE JUST AS GOOD AT LISTENING AS THEY ARE AT DICTATING ORDERS OF THE GAMES THAT WE WON WE WON BOTH OF THEM BY GETTING A TORPEDO DIRECT HIT AND THE OTHER TEAM DOING TWO DAMAGE TO THEMSELVES CAPTAINS SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT MOVING TOO MUCH IN A LONG LINE BECAUSE EVENTUALLY IT WILL BE EASY TO LINE UP HOW YOU'VE MOVED AROUND ISLANDS AND THEN THEY CAN POTENTIALLY GET A DIRECT HIT

THE ENGINEER AND THE RADIO OPERATOR ARE THE TWO MOST DIFFICULT POSITIONS THE RADIO OPERATOR IS ALL ABOUT LISTENING WE INTENTIONALLY PLAYED WITH THE ABILITY TO AT ANY POINT SAY STOP FOR RULES DISCUSSIONS AND THAT AT THAT POINT EVERYONE WOULD STOP SO THAT WE COULD DISCUSS RULES FOR THE RADIO OPERATOR WE SPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM THAT THEY NEED TO SPEAK UP IF THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE HEARING THE OPPOSING CAPTAIN IF THEIR FACE IS DOWN AND THEY'RE PROJECTING AT THE TABLE INTO THE DIVIDERS YOU HAVE TO COMMUNICATE THAT OR ELSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO EVER FIND THE OPPOSING SUB

THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF TENSION BETWEEN THE CAPTAIN AND THE ENGINEER A BAD ENGINEER WILL DO PERMANENT DAMAGE OR PREVENT WEAPONS FROM BEING USABLE A BAD CAPTAIN WILL DO THE SAME ENGINEERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY WE CANNOT GO NORTH ANY MORE BEFORE IT'S THE LAST MINUTE ENGINEERS NEED TO COMMUNICATE WHEN IT'S TIME TO SURFACE THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ASK WHICH TOOL WOULD YOU LIKE READY TO USE AND OK WELL IF YOU COULD GO NORTH AND WEST THAT WOULD HELP US A LOT

THE GAME PLAYS MUCH FASTER THAN YOU EXPECT FOUR HIT POINTS IS NOT A LOT ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO GET A DIRECT HIT THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT IT TAKES ABOUT AS LONG TO TEACH THE RULES AS IT DOES TO PLAY THE GAME I THINK MOST GAMES OF SPLENDOR TAKE LONGER WHICH IS FINE I WOULDN'T WANT TO PLAY A SINGLE GAME OF CAPTAIN SONAR FOR HOURS I DON'T VIEW CAPTAIN SONAR AS A MAIN EVENT OF A GAMING EVENING IT'S NOT QUITE FILLER FOR ME BUT IT'S CLOSE I COULD PLAY THREE HOURS OF CONSECUTIVE GAMES OF AVALON I WOULD ONLY BE WILLING TO PLAY AT MAX THREE GAMES IN A ROW OF CAPTAIN SONAR THE DECISIONS JUST AREN'T THAT INTERESTING FOR OVER AND OVER PLAY

THAT SAID IT'S A GOOD GAME I WOULDN'T BUY A COPY MYSELF SINCE I ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO ONE IN MY GAME GROUP IT'S NOT A MUST BUY FOR ME IF I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A COPY BUT IT'S WORTH HAVING IN YOUR COLLECTION

I THINK IT'S A GREAT GAME FOR THE RIGHT GROUP BUT IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY DO IT FOR ME I'LL PLAY IT ON OCCASION I THINK I'M MORE LIKELY TO PLAY IT AS A START TO THE NIGHT OR AN END TO THE NIGHT NOT THE MAIN FEATURE IT RANKS SLIGHTLY ABOVE SPLENDOR IN MY INTEREST TO PLAY
I'M GLAD I SOLD MY COPY THAT I GOT FOR AND SOLD IT FOR SINCE IT WAS OUT OF STOCK AT THE TIME
OH GEEZ I HATED IT IT'S HEADACHE IN A BOX
I THOUGHT IT WAS UNIQUE BUT I WOULD NEVER ASK TO PLAY IT I JUST DON'T FIND THE GAME TO BE STRATEGICALLY DEEP THE DRAW OF THE GAME IS THE NOVELTY OF IT BEING REAL-TIME AND TRYING TO FIND THE ENEMY BOTH OF THESE PROPERTIES DON'T WOW ME AFTER ONE GAME I WAS DONE
FOR ALL THEY HYPE I KINDA HATED IT
THE FIRST MATE DOESN'T HONESTLY FEEL LIKE THEY DO MUCH THERE'S ALMOST NO REASON THE APTIAN OR ENGINEER SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT ROLE

AND ALSO WHILE ON PAPER IT SOUNDED IN IN PRACTICE REAL TIME PUZZLE SOLVING IS SO NOT MY THING THE RADAR OPERATOR HAS AN INTERESTING JOB BUT EVEN IF THEY FIND THE SHIP THE APTIAN BETTER HOPE HE'S ABLE TO THEN GET THERE IN OUR GAME IT SEEMED EVERY TIME THE RADAR THOUGHT HE WAS RIGHT THEY WERE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE MAP
I THINK PLAYING AS THE RADIO OPERATOR IS FANTASTIC ONE OF THE BEST GAMING EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER HAD THE OTHER ROLES THOUGH FEEL LIKE THEY ONLY EXIST TO MAKE IT INTO A PROPER GAME CAPTAIN IS OBVIOUSLY NECESSARY BUT THE FIRST MATE AND ENGINEER ARE JUST DOING BUSYWORK THE WHOLE GAME EXACTLY ONE PERSON IN OUR GROUP OF ACTUALLY ENJOYED IT EVERYONE ELSE FOUND ENGINEER EXHAUSTING AND FIRST MATE BORING

I THINK THE RO ROLE IS GOING TO BE COPIED IN A BETTER GAME VERY SOON AND I'D RATHER JUST PLAY THAT
I PLAYED IT TIMES RECENTLY AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE EXPERIENCE BUT IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT OFF MY WISELIEST ASIDE FROM PLAYING WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS OF FRIENDS AND TAKING DIFFERENT ROLES I DON'T THINK THE ACTUAL GAME HAS ENOUGH VARIABILITY TO MAKE ME WANT TO PLAY IT MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF TIMES
HYPE HAS CERTAINLY DIED FOR THE GAME I WAS CONSIDERING GETTING THE GAME AND IT'S NOW OFF THE LIST

CAN YOU TELL WHAT MY FAVORITE PURCHASE THIS YEAR WAS

THIS GAME IS AMAZING IF YOU LIKE SUSHI GO THIS IS THE SAME BUT SO MUCH BETTER IT PLAYS UP TO PEOPLE WHICH GIVEN THE LIGHT RULESET AND QUICK-PACED DRAFTING GAMEPLAY IS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT AND YOU CAN CHOSE WHICH CARDS TO PLAY WITH SO EACH GAME IS VERY DIFFERENT AND THE VARIETY RAMPS UP TO PLUS IT HAS AN ADORABLE BOARD THAT HAS A MODULAR MENU SO YOU NEVER FORGET WHAT CARDS ARE IN THE DECK AND DOUBLES AS A SCORE TRACKER SOMETHING THAT THE SECOND EDITION OF SUSHI GO LACKED
I'M A BIG FAN OF COUP IT WAS FEATURED ON TABLE TOP ON YOUTUBE ALTHOUGH THEY MESSED UP A RULE OR TWO IT'S SIMPLE AND FUN ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CALL YOUR FRIENDS DIRTY LIARS APPROX
MEN OF MAYHEM SONS OF ANARCHY BOARD GAME I FIRMLY BELIEVE THIS GAME WOULD HAVE BEEN A HUGE HIT IF IT WERENT FOR THE TV SHOW IP SERIOUSLY ITS IN MY TOP FIVE GAMES AND IT IS CURRENTLY ON SALE FOR
I'D SAY BRING YOUR OWN BOOK
I HAVE THIS ARRIVING TODAY I WAS ALREADY EXCITED BECAUSE I LOVE THE ORIGINAL GAME SO MUCH BUT NOW I AM AMEED THANKS FOR THE GREAT POST
DO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH IT IF YOU ALMOST ALWAYS PLAY TWO PLAYER I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THE ROLE CARDS ARE ONLY USEFUL IF YOU HAVE MORE PLAYERS TO BE ABLE TO DO A BIGGER VARIETY OF THINGS
I LOVE PANDEMIC THE CURE BUT THE EXPANSION IS JUST TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ME TOO BAD BECAUSE I'VE READ HEARD VERY GOOD COMMENTS ON IT
I AM SO EAGER FOR THIS I LOVE PANDEMIC AND I LOVE CUSTOM DICE SO THE CURE ALWAYS HAD A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART THE EXPANSION LOOKS AMAZING MINE FINALLY SHIPPED TODAY SO I'LL HAVE IT BY THIS WEEKEND
THE NEW ROLES ARE SQUARE CUT THE ORIGINAL PRINTING OF THE CURE ARE CUT LIKE ID BADGES

SIGH I REALLY WISH THEY'D KEPT UP WITH THE ID BADGES FROM A DESIGN POINT OF VIEW THAT WAS ONCE OF THE COOLEST THINGS I'VE SEEN IN ANY BOARD GAME
I'VE PLAYED THE BASE GAME A FEW TIMES AND ORDERED THIS EXPANSION I FOUND THE BASE GAME TO BE HARDER TO WIN THAN REGULAR PANDEMIC AND WE PLAY IN THE LAB WITH THE PURPLE DISEASE I THINK WE JUST HAVEN'T FIGURED THIS ONE OUT YET

IT FEELS ALMOST AS BRUTAL AS SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL BIOHAZARDS SLAY THIS SPACE MARINE
AMERITRASH IS TYPICALLY DESCRIBED BY THEME OVER MECHANICS OFTEN INCLUDING ELEMENTS OF LUCK WHICH ALLOW FOR BIG SWINGS AND TENSE MOMENTS

EURO STYLE GAMING IS OFTEN DESCRIBED BY VERY INTENTIONAL MECHANICS WHICH ALLOW FOR STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT THAT ISN'T DEPENDENT ON POTENTIAL FORTUNE
DON'T GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE DISTINCTION THOUGH MANY GAMES COMING OUT NOW ARE CONSIDERED HYBRIDS INCORPORATING BOTH EURO AND ELEMENTS ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE MANY GAMES THAT COME FROM EUROPE SUCH AS ITALY AND FRANCE THAT DON'T FOLLOW THE GERMAN DESIGN MODEL WHICH IS WHERE THE EURO CONCEPT MOSTLY ORIGINATED

YOU'LL ALSO PROBABLY FIND THAT YOUR TASTES WILL FLUCTUATE AND CHANGE OVER TIME SO DON'T CHAIN YOURSELF TO AN ULTIMATELY MEANINGLESS DICHOTOMY
CAVEAT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN DEFINITIONS OF AMERITRASH AND EUROGAME

FURTHER CAVEAT THE DISTINCTIONS ARE BLURRIER THAN THEY WERE TEN YEARS AGO AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF GAMES THAT ARE EXPLICITLY HYBRIDS OF THE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT

MY PERSONAL FAVORITE DISTINCTION IS THAT AMERITRASH GAMES ARE ABOUT DIRECT CONFLICT I EAST FIGHTING AND EUROGAMES ARE ABOUT INDIRECT CONFLICT I EAST ECONOMICS IF MY GUY CAN ATTACK YOUR GUY THAT'S AMERITRASH IF WE'RE COMPETING OVER A SHARED POOL OF RESOURCES THAT'S EURO

ONE OF THE CLASSIC DISTINCTIONS IS THAT AMERITRASH GAMES PUT THE THEME FIRST LEADING TO EXCITING DUNGEON CRAWLS WITH LOTS OF FIDDLY RULES SO YOUR CHARACTER SHOOTS ARROWS AND WALKS THROUGH DOORS REALISTICALLY AND EUROGAMES PUT MECHANICS FIRST LEADING TO CLEAN SIMPLE RULESETS ABOUT VERY BORING SUBJECTS LIKE CLOTH TRADING WHERE THE RULES DON'T ALWAYS MAKE THEMATIC SENSE I DON'T PERSONALLY THINK THIS ONE IS ALL THAT IMPORTANT ANYMORE BECAUSE THE TWO CAMPS HAVE LEARNED FROM EACH OTHER AMERITRASH DESIGNERS HAVE LEARNED HOW TO STREAMLINE AND EUROGAME DESIGNERS HAVE LEARNED HOW TO EVOKE THEME THERE ARE STILL GAMES AT BOTH EXTREMES OF THE SPECTRUM BUT MORE AND MORE GAMES ARE INHABITING THE BLURRY MIDDLE GROUND

ANOTHER CLASSIC DISTINCTION IS THAT AMERITRASH GAMES INCORPORATE LOTS OF RANDOMNESS AND EUROGAMES INCORPORATE VERY LITTLE AGAIN I THINK THE TWO CAMPS HAVE LEARNED FROM EACH OTHER AMERITRASH DESIGNERS HAVE LEARNED ABOUT MEANINGFUL DECISION-MAKING OUTSIDE OF DICE AND EURO DESIGNERS HAVE LEARNED THAT RANDOMIZER CAN MIX A GAME UP WITHOUT RUINING ITS STRATEGIC VALUE
WE ACTUALLY CALL THEM EURORUBBISH NOW TO EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD
JUST A LITTLE WORD OF THOUGHT I QUITE LIKE QUINAS DECISION TO CALL IT PULP OR THEMATIC THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THOSE COMMENTS AND IT CAN BE ODD FOR AN OUTSIDER TO LEARN THAT AMERITRASH IS AN AFFECTIONATE TERM
LET'S JUST END THE DEBATE CALL THEM AMER AND EURO BOTH LETTER WORDS LIKE CODE FOR CATEGORIES
I'M ALWAYS AMAZED THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS CONTINUED THE USE OF AMERITRASH IT'S QUITE PEJORATIVE
ANOTHER DISTINCTION IS INTERACTION AMERICAN GAMES TEND TO ALLOW PLAYERS TO REALLY MESS WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF WHEREAS EUROS HAVE INDIRECT INTERACTION SUCH AS TAKING THE LAST COW AT THE STORE
MY OVERSIMPLIFICATION


AMERITRASH RANDOMNESS


EURO DELIBERATENESS
NONE THESE ARE TERMS SOME PEOPLE USE TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE FEEL LIKE SHIT ABOUT THE GAMES THEY ENJOY PLAYING

THEY OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED
I PLAYED IT LAST WEEKEND AND THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BUY A COPY VERY SOON
I'M TEMPTED TO GET THE GAME BUT I'VE HEARD THE ANIMALS YOU BUILD WITH TRAITS DON'T FEEL LIKE ANIMALS SINCE IT'S JUST A BOARD THAT REPRESENTS POP AND SIZE ALSO IS THE GAME LUCK BASED SINCE YOUR PLAY DEPEND ON WHAT CARDS YOU HAVE IN YOUR HAND
I PLAYED IT WITH MY WIFE AND ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED HER WHICH WAS WEIRD BECAUSE SHE USUALLY KICKS MY BUTT IN EVERYTHING ELSE SHE SAID IT WAS DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF CHOICES SHE HAD EACH TURN AND IT WAS HARD FOR HER TO DECIDE ON A STRATEGY I JUST LET THE CARDS I DREW DETERMINE MY STRATEGY ALSO SHE DIDN'T MAKE ANY CARNIVORES SO EVERY TURN I WAS EATING ONE OF HER SPECIES TO DEATH AND SHE HAD NOTHING TO COUNTER IT

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT IT'S TRUE THE ANIMAL HAS TO KIND OF EXIST IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE IT IS MERELY A BOARD AND A FEW CARDS BUT I'M A ROLEPLAYED SO THAT COMES NATURALLY TO ME I HAD THE COOPERATION TRAIT ON ONE OF MY SPECIES SO IT WAS FUN TO IMAGINE HOW THE TWO WORKED TOGETHER TO GET FOOD MY CARNIVORES WERE INTELLIGENT PACK HUNTERS WHICH I FOUND TO BE A DEADLY COMBO NOT UNLIKE IN REAL NATURE

IT'S A WONDERFUL GAME AND A GREAT CONCEPTUAL TOOL FOR TEACHING EVOLUTION CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES KILLING OFF YOUR SPECIES EVOLVE TO ADAPT TO THEM BUT THEN THINGS MIGHT CHANGE IN A NEW DIRECTION AND YOUR PREVIOUS ADAPTATION IS NO LONGER USEFUL AND POSSIBLY EVEN HARMFUL GET TOO BIG AND CONSUME TOO MANY RESOURCES AND YOU'LL FACE A DIE-BACK

IT'S A WONDERFUL GAME I JUST HOPE MY WIFE WILL WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN
I'VE ONLY PLAYED MY COPY ONCE AND ONLY WITH 2 PLAYERS BUT IT WAS STILL A BLAST BASE EVOLUTION WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES AND CLIMATE JUST SWEETENED THE POT WITH VERY LITTLE NEW RULE COMPLEXITY

I LOVE MIGRATORY IT'S SO POWERFUL IN OUR GAME WE HAD MULTIPLE DESERTIFICATION EVENTS WITHIN A FEW TURNS OF EACH OTHER SO FOOD RAN OUT FAST I HAD SEVERAL SPECIES SUFFER BIG LOSSES BUT MY SPOUSE HAD DIFFERENT MIGRATORY SPECIES I WENT CARNIVORE WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE
I ALREADY HAD THE BASE GAME 2ND EDITION AND FLIGHT SO I OPTED FOR THE CONVERSION KIT WHICH I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT

FIRST THINGS FIRST I REALLY LIKE EVOLUTION AND EVEN THOUGH I'VE ONLY PLAYED IT A COUPLE TIMES I REALLY LIKE THE FLIGHT EXPANSION AS WELL I'M SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED THAT FLIGHT ISN'T COMPATIBLE WITH CLIMATE BUT I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT BLOAT THAT LED TO NORTH STAR DECIDING THEY SHOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE

CAN ANYONE THAT BOUGHT THE VERSION OF CLIMATE TELL ME WHAT COMES IN THE BOX I HAD A HARD TIME DETERMINING THAT WHEN I CHOSE BETWEEN THE CONVERSION KIT AND THE STANDALONE I GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCES

IN THE CONVERSION KIT YOU GET THE BOARD THE CLIMATE EVENT CARDS NEW TRAIT CARDS EACH OF THE NEW TRAITS MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THE OLD TRAIT CARDS WITH CLIMATE CHANGES AMBUSH BURROWING CARNIVORE DEFENSIVE HERDING AND THE LITTLE WOODEN CLIMATE MARKER

IT SEEMS STRANGE TO ME IS THAT ONLY THE NEW CARDS AND THE CARDS HAVE CLIMATE CLIMATE INFLUENCING EFFECTS IS THIS TRUE OF THE AS WELL IT SEEMS WAY TOO EASY FOR PEOPLE TO GET A HAND FULL OF CARDS THAT GIVE THEM NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER OVER THE DEADLY CLIMATE EFFECTS THAT COULD WIPE OUT THEIR CREATURES DO ALL THE CARDS IN THE VERSION HAVE SUN SNOWFLAKE ICONS OR IS IT THE SAME AS IN THE CONVERSION KIT

ALSO THE FIRST THING THAT REALLY JUMPED OUT AND BUGGED ME WHILE PLAYING CLIMATE OTHER THAN THE ABOVE AND THE MISPRINT IN THE PLAYER AID THAT MAKES MIGRATORY WAY BETTER WAS THE FACT THAT BODY FAT HAS NO INTERACTION WITH CLIMATE WHATSOEVER THIS SEEMS LIKE A COMPLETE OVERSIGHT TO ME WHEN ALL YOU HAVE TO THINK OF IS JUST ABOUT ANY DWELLING CREATURE TO OBSERVE THEM PACKING ON WEIGHT TO SURVIVE THE COLD WHILE THE ONLY SPECIES THAT REALLY SCREAMS DEFENSIVE HERDING TO SURVIVE THE COLD TO ME ARE PENGUINS

ANYWAY STILL LOVE EVOLUTION AS A GAME BUT TL R I FEEL LIKE I MADE A MISTAKE WITH THE CONVERSION KIT AND HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WITH THE VERSION CAN CONFIRM OR DENY THAT FEELING
I CANCELLED MY PLEDGE BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED THE CLIMATE STUFF WOULD MAKE THE GAME REALLY SWINGY ANYONE HAVE THOUGHTS ON THAT I REALLY LIKE THE BASE GAME
I HAVE PLAYED AGRICOLA OVER TIMES THE ORIGINAL EDITION

THE NEW EDITION OF AGRICOLA FROM MAYFAIR IS REALLY WELL DONE STANDARDIZING THE WORDING ON THE CARDS THE INCLUSION OF ALL THE SHAPED PIECES ARE ALL A PLUS THE REDUCTION IN PLAYER COUNT IS NOT A BIG DEAL BUT THE REDUCTION IN PRICE IS

I HAVE THE PLAYER EXPANSION ESSEN PURCHASE AND SOME OF THE CARDS IN IT ARE QUITE GOOD SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE NEW AGRICOLA IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT
I HAD NEVER PLAYED AGRICOLA BEFORE AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MAYFAIR EDITION I KNOW THAT THE PREVIOUS EDITIONS HAVE TOKENS TO REPRESENT ANIMALS AND CROPS AND THE MAYFAIR EDITION HAS WOODEN ANIMEEPLES THEY ARE A REALLY NICE TOUCH TO THE GAME I DON'T THINK I WOULD EVER WANT TO PLAY A PLAYER GAME OF AGRICOLA SO MAYFAIR WORKED OUT WELL
I HAVE NEVER PLAYED IT AT AND PROBABLY NEVER WILLIAM I NEVER USE THE FAMILY SIDE OF THE BOARD I HAVE HAD THE VERSION FOR YEARS AND HAVEN'T LOOKED INTO THE MAYFAIR VERSION IN DETAIL BUT IF ALL THAT IS MISSING IS THE FAMILY EDITION AND 5TH PLAYER I SAY GO FOR THE CHEAPER GAME
THE MAYFAIR FAMILY EDITION IS A DIFFERENT GAME FROM THE FAMILY EDITION THE FAMILY EDITION MOSTLY JUST SUBTRACTS THE CARDS WHEREAS THE MAYFAIR FAMILY EDITION HAS A NEW BOARD AND AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SIMPLIFIED SCORING SYSTEM SO WHEREAS IT WAS EASY TO GRADUATE FROM THE FAMILY EDITION AND STEP UP INTO REGULAR AGRICOLA I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S QUITE THE SAME FOR THE NEW FAMILY EDITION
FROM MY RESEARCH THE MAYFAIR EDITION HAS BETTER CARDS BECAUSE THEY REVISED THEM SO THAT VERSION WILL BE PREFERRED NOW HOWEVER PEOPLE ALSO RECOMMENDED ME TO WAIT FOR THE ALL IN MAYFAIR EDITION COMING SOME TIME NEXT YEAR THAT WILL HAVE ADDED CARD PACKS AND THE PLAYER ADDITIONS
YOU'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF RESPONSES HERE BUT THE MAIN THING NO ONE IS MENTIONING IS THAT THERE IS A VARIANT SUGGESTED IN THE RULES FOR THE REVISED EDITION TO REMOVE THE OCCUPATION AND MINOR IMPROVEMENT CARDS THIS IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE FAMILY EDITION OF THE Z MAN VERSION DID TO HELP TEACH THE GAME THE REVISED EDITION MORE OR LESS COVERS ALL OF THE SAME BASES AS THE OLD VERSION I'D DEFINITELY SUGGEST GETTING IT AS IT'S CHEAPER AND YOU'VE SAID YOU DON'T PLAN TO PLAY WITH MORE THAN TYPICALLY
NORMALLY I'D SAY SAVE YOUR MONEY
BUT IN THIS CASE WE'VE PLAYED THE VERSION OVER A HUNDRED TIMES AND ALMOST ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN USING THE FAMILY VERSION OUR PERCEPTION RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY IS THAT THE CAN BE UNBALANCED AND IS ONE MORE BARRIER TO GETTING CUBES UP TO SPEED
PLUS YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THAT 5TH PERSON MAY WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY WE REALLY ENJOY IT AS A FIVE PLAYER GAME CHANGES DYNAMICS QUITE A BIT

SUPER EXPERIENCED AGRIC PLAYER HERE GOT TO PLAY THE NEW VERSION MULTIPLE TIMES AT GEN CON IT'S A BIT LESS OF A CHALLENGE EXPERIENCED PLAYERS CAN EXPLOIT A COUPLE CARDS BUT STILL VERY MUCH CAPTURES THE SPIRIT OF THE OG AGRICOLA

UNLESS YOU WANT A GAME OR PLAN ON PLAYING OVER TIMES A YEAR NOT ENOUGH CARDS TO SUPPORT A TON OF REPLAY VERY SAFE TO GET THE NEW VERSION

DON'T PLAY THE BASIC GAME PLAYING OCCUPATIONS AND MINOR IMPROVEMENTS IS AN ENORMOUS PART OF THE RICHNESS
I DON'T GET THE APPEAL OF THE FAMILY SIDE PLAYED WITH SOME FRIENDS WHO I'D ONLY PLAYED LORDS OF WATERDEEP WITH BEFORE AND THEY WERE FINE WITH CARDS
ONE THING I WILL SAY IS THAT THE CARD STOCK OF THE NEW VERSION IS MUCH THINNER THAN THE IT'S ONLY NOTICEABLE IF YOUR RIFFLE SHUFFLE BUT IT IS NOTICEABLE ON THE OTHER HAND THE CARDS SEEM MORE FOCUSED WITH THE REMOVAL OF SOME OF THE LESS USEFUL CARDS
MY FRIENDS AND I DONT PLAY THE FAMILY EDITION EITHER AND THE GAME MAY BE TOO HEAVY FOR KIDS EVEN WITH THE FAMILY VERSION I GO FOR THE LESS COSTLY VERSION TOO ESPECIALLY IF THE CARDS ARE IMPROVED
NEVER PLAYED REVISED EDITION

EDITION'S FAMILY GAME I FIND ESSENTIAL TO TEACHING NEW PLAYERS THE GAME AS WELL AS JUST THE ONLY LEVEL SOME PEOPLE ENJOY THE GAME AT THE CARDS ARE REALLY NICE TO ADD REPLAY VALUE TO THE GAME IF YOU'RE PLAYING IT A BUNCH OF TIMES IN A SHORT TIME FRAME BUT EVEN WITH EXPERIENCE PLAYERS WE SEEM TO ALWAYS GRAVITATE BACK TO THE FAMILY VERSION FOR INFREQUENT PLAYS OF THE GAME I THINK FOR A PLAY OF THE GAME THE CARDS OFFER TOO MANY CHOICES AND WITHOUT HAVING PLAYED THE GAME ONCE YOU SIMPLY DON'T HAVE A GREAT GRASP OF WHAT CARDS ARE POWERFUL AND WHAT CARDS AREN'T SO IF YOU'RE ME HAVING PLAYED IT A BUNCH AN ALREADY HIGH SKILL GAME BECOMES EVEN EASIER TO WIN WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT CARDS TO USE AND YOUR OPPONENTS ARE CLUELESS WHICH ISN'T DESIREABLE

SO PERSONALLY I'LL NEVER BUY THE REVISED EDITION LOSING THE FAMILY GAME DOESN'T SEEM WORTH IT FOR THE VARIETY OF GAMERS I PLAY WITH
COOL THING YOU HAVE GOING I WASN'T ABLE TO BACK AHEAD IN THE CLOUDS BUT I JUST MAY GRAB IT FOR THIS THANKS FOR GIVING SOMETHING BACK THIS TIME OF YEAR
MY CHOICES ARE TYPICALLY PLAYING A GATEWAY GAME OR NOT PLAYING A GAME AT ALL
THE GAMES I WOULD PLAY ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY AROUND ME

I WOULD GLADLY PLAY A GATEWAY GAME IF THAT WAS WHAT KIND OF PLAYERS I HAD AROUND ME OR IF MY MENTAL ACUITY WAS ALREADY DRAINED SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO HAVE A RELAXING GAMING EXPERIENCE AND NOT ALWAYS TAX YOUR BRAIN PLAYING HEAVIER GAMES
GOOD GAMES AREN'T RELEGATED TO A CERTAIN WEIGHT OR COMPLEXITY OR TIME INVESTMENT GATEWAY GAMES ARE ENJOYABLE SOME OFFER MORE RETURNS THAN OTHERS AND THOSE DON'T MAKE IT INTO MY COLLECTION BUT THE ONES THAT I THINK HAVE LEGS GET PLAYED AS MUCH OR MORE THAN OTHERS IN MY COLLECTION
YES ABSOLUTELY I HAVE TWO TICKET TO RIDE GAMES CARCASSONNE AND CATAN STILL ON MY SHELF FOR THAT VERY REASON SOMETIMES I JUST GET AN ITCH MY TASTE HAS REFINED OVER THE YEARS BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GREAT GAMES I STILL GET A LOT OF ENJOYMENT OUT OF THEM

BY CONTRAST I HAVE ZERO INTEREST IN PLAYING SCYTHE
HONESTLY I PREFER GATEWAY GAMES IN GENERAL EVEN AS I'VE GOTTEN MORE INTO THE HOBBY OF THE HEAVIER GAMES THAT I'VE TRIED I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT MANY OF THEM REALLY ADD MUCH IN THE WAY OF STRATEGIC DEPTH USUALLY IT'S JUST REPETITION AND BOOKKEEPING EVEN IF A GATEWAY GAME DOES LACK A BIT IN LONG TERM STRATEGIC DEPTH I OFTEN WOULD RATHER EXPLORE THAT DEPTH AND THEN SELL THE GAME AND TRY A NEW ONE VERSUS GETTING INTO SOME REALLY SUPER COMPLEX GAME I TEND TO REALLY VALUE A TIGHT AND CLEAR RULE SET AND GAMES THAT CAN'T BE QUICKLY AND EASILY EXPLAINED AND GRASPED BY SOMEONE WHO BOARDGAMES AT LEAST CASUALLY I'M NOT INTERESTED IN NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN
YEAH ALL THE TIME I STILL LOVE LOOK AT ME AND THE OTHERS PLAYERS CREATIONS IN CASTLE OF MAD KIND LUDWIG STOBBING TROUGH THE LANDS WITH MY PILLAGING ORCS IN SMALL WORLD OR INCITING OTHER PLAYERS CALLS THE BLACK CUBES IN WATERDEEP FOR ROGUES SMASH UP HAVE BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES SINCE I GOT IT AND I DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING ANYTIME SOON

I KEEP THEM BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE GOOD GAMES AND I LIKE TO HAVE A TONS OF OPTIONS FOR GAMES TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILIES INSTEAD OF JUST BIG HULKING BOXES OF STRATEGIES TO BE HONEST I THINK THIS IS A SORT OF WIERD QUESTION SINCE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING THAT SHOULD SUGGEST SCYTHE AND CO AS A OBJECTIVELY BETTER GAME

ON A SLIGHTLY UNRELATED NOTE I REALLY DISLIKE THE TERM GATEWAY GAMES I DON'T GET THE NEED OF THE WORD EVERYONE I KNOW I FULLY CAPABLE OF LEARNING ANY GAME AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE OFFENDED IF I SOMEONE WANTED TO TRY SCYTHE AND I WENT OH YOU A NOT READY FOR THAT HERE LETS PLAY TICKET TO RIDE SO YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF AREA CONTROL
I HAVEN'T BEEN INTO THIS HOBBY FOR VERY LONG YET BUT I DON'T GET THE FEELING THAT I'LL STOP ENJOYING LIGHTER GATEWAY STYLE GAMES I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM OF LIKING TOO MANY THINGS AND NOT HAVING ENOUGH TIME TO EXPLORE THEM ALL BUT LIGHT TO MEDIUM WEIGHT BOARD GAMES ARE A GREAT OUTLET FOR THAT

WITH THAT SAID I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY THAT I CAN SIT DOWN WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS AND PLAY AN EPIC GAME OF OR THROUGH THE AGES BUT I THINK THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ROOM ON MY CALENDAR AND IN MY HEART FOR GAMES LIKE TICKET TO RIDE ESPECIALLY SINCE THOSE ARE THE GAMES THAT I'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH MY FAMILY
I PLAY A LOT OF GATEWAY GAMES

MY WIFE DOESN'T LIKE TO LEARN NEW GAMES AND SHE LIKES WHAT SHE LIKES

WHEN I GET TO PLAY WITH OTHER PEOPLE I AM OFTEN INTRODUCING THEM TO MODERN BOARD GAMES

WE HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD SO SETTING ASIDE THE TIME AND FINDING WILLING PARTICIPANTS TO PLAY THE HEAVIER GAMES I OWN IS REALLY DIFFICULT
WE STILL PLAY MOST OF THE GAMES WE GOT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OUT LIKE TICKET TO RIDE KING OF TOKYO WONDERS SMALL WORLD DOMINION JUST THE OTHER DAY WE PLAYED LORDS OF WATERDEEP RIGHT AFTER A HEAVY GAME OF A FEAST FOR ODIN AND LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT
READING THIS AND THE COMMENTS JUST MAKES ME REALIZE HOW VASTLY DIFFERENT VARIOUS DEFINITIONS OF GATEWAY GAME ARE
YES AND ACTUALLY I DON'T LIKE THE GATEWAY TERM BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THOSE HAVE ARE ONLY GOOD TO GET INTO THE HOBBY AND YOU NEED TO MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE LATER

TR CATAN OR SIMILAR GAMES ARE GREAT BECAUSE YOU CAN TEACH IT TO FRIENDS THEY UNDERSTAND IT AND ARE ABLE TO ENJOY IT FROM THE FIRST GAME YOU DON'T NEED TO PLAY A FIRST 2 HOURS GAME BEFORE UNDERSTANDING THE STRATEGY NEEDED TO WIN

FINALLY I OFTEN PLAY WITH YOUNG KIDS AND FOR THAT YOU NEED SIMPLE GAMES
ALSO THE RULES ARE SIMPLE ENOUGH SO YOU CAN TEACH THEM IN MINUTES
I'LL ASSUME YOU MEAN BEYOND PLAYING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS OR OTHER

YEAH I HAVE A HARD TIME PLAYING GAMES WITH GAMERS IT KINDA SUCKS BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT INTO HEAVY GAMES SO I'M USUALLY THE LIGHTWEIGHT AT THE TABLE

BUT AS I DO GET TO PLAY HOKKAIDO ENOUGH I DON'T COMPLAIN
SURE I HAVE NOTHING INHERENTLY AGAINST GATEWAY GAMES BUT FOR SURE THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE BORING TO ME I WOULD EASILY START UP A GAME OF KING OF TOKYO A GAME OF TICKET TO RIDE I GUESS IF THAT WAS THE ONLY OPTION


REALLY JUST FUN THINGS ARE STILL FUN
I THINK I TEND TO THROW AN EXPANSION OR TWO IN WHEN I'M PLAYING SO-CALLED GATEWAY GAMES I STILL LOVE CARCASSONNE BUT I LIKE PLAYING IT WITH AT LEAST INNS CATHEDRALS TRADERS BUILDERS AND ABBEY MAYOR I'LL PLAY TICKET TO RIDE BUT I PREFER PLAYING ONE OF THE EXPANSION BOARDS I QUITE LIKE PENNSYLVANIA

I DON'T THINK THIS HAS TO DO WITH WEIGHT OR COMPLEXITY AS MUCH AS JUST THE FACT THAT I'VE JUST PLAYED A LOT OF THOSE GAMES
I PLAY LOTS OF HEAVY GAMES I PLAY LOTS OF GATEWAY GAMES I LIKE PLAYING GAMES

ON SATURDAY I PLAYED PARIS CONNECTION MOMBASA JAMAICA AND POTION EXPLOSION ON THURSDAY IT WAS LEWIS CLARK TR NORDIC COUNTRIES AND BIBLIOG KEEPING VARIETY ALIVE
RANT MODE ON

YOU ARE VERY DISMISSIVE OF SO CALLED GATEWAY GAMES BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE GAMES ARE AN ACTIVITY THAT ARE ENJOYED WITH PEOPLE RATHER THAN THE ACTIVITY I PLAY LIGHTER GAMES GENERALLY AS THEY ARE EASIER TO EXPLAIN AND PLAY WHILST STILL KEEPING THE NOT MONOPOLY VIBE I'M NOT ALWAYS IN THE MOOD OR HAVE TIME FOR A MINUTE HEAVY WORKER PLACEMENT

RANT MODE OFF
YEP I'LL ENJOY ANYTHING IF THE GROUP IS INTO IT UP TO THE 2 HOUR MARK
I'VE PLAYED A LOT OF POTION EXPLOSION LATELY AND THAT'S DEFINITELY A LIGHT-WEIGHT GATEWAY GAME PLAYED BETRAYAL THE OTHER NIGHT AND SUSHI GO A LOT EVEN WHEN IT'S JUST MY FIANCEE AND ME WHO ARE FAIRLY SERIOUS GAMERS SURE THERE ARE GAMES THAT I'VE LOST ENTHUSIASM FOR BUT IT ISN'T SOLELY BECAUSE OF WEIGHT COMPLEXITY THERE ARE A TON OF DIFFERENT FACTORS INVOLVED
YEAH I STILL PLAY GATEWAY GAMES I'D SAY THAT GATEWAY GAMES TAKE UP MOST OF MY TIME PLAYING GAMES ACTUALLY

BUT DO I STILL GET THE ITCH TO PLAY THEM NO NOT REALLY LIKE SO MANY OTHERS I'M STILL TRYING TO FIND A GROUP OF FOLKS INTERESTED IN BIGGER GAMES BUT I HAVE A CURRENT GROUP THAT'S OPEN TO TRYING LIGHTER GAMES I GENUINELY LIKE THE GAMES AND I'D PROBABLY DEVELOP AN ITCH TO PLAY THEM IF THEY WEREN'T SO FREQUENTLY PLAYED ALREADY BUT AS IT IS I'M GETTING PRETTY TIRED OF CATAN AND SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM WHILE SO MANY OF MY DEEPER GAMES STAY UNPLAYED

BUT I'LL TAKE EASIER GAMES OVER NO GAMES SO I PLAY
WE PLAYED TICKET TO RIDE TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ABOUT YEARS AND I HAD A GREAT TIME IT PROBABLY HELPED THAT I WON BY OVER POINTS
RARELY BUT WHEN I DO I USUALLY ENJOY IT
IT BEATS PLAYING THE GAME OF LIFE SO YES
WHILE I NOW PREFER OR HEAVIER GAMES ALMOST ALL THE PEOPLE I PLAY WITH PREFER GAMES AS SUCH I SPEND A LOT MORE TIME PLAYING THOSE KINDS OF GAMES THAN ANYTHING FROM MY COLLECTION IF I ONLY WANTED TO PLAY SAY TIGRIS EUPHRATES OR VINOS I WOULD FIND MYSELF RARELY GETTING A GAME
I'M NOT SURE WHICH EXACTLY ARE GATEWAY GAMES BUT I STILL LOVE CODENAMES AND LOVE LETTER AND RED DRAGON INN AND THEY PROBABLY ARE STILL IN MY TOP PLAYED GAMES
I ANAY SELECTIVE GATEWAY GAMES I ABSOLUTELY HATE CATAN OR TICKET TO RIDE OR PANDEMIC BUT COULD GLADLY PLAY CARCASSONNE

WHILE I DO LIKE SOME HEAVIER GAMES I DON'T THINK THEY OFTEN WARRANT THE COMPLEXITY THESE GAMES MIGHT HAVE A SHIT TON OF COMPONENTS AND MECHANISMS BUT LACK THE FINESSE AND CLARITY DEEPER GAME WITH A SOLID STREAMLINED OPTIONS IS THE HAPPY MEDIUM
ALL THE TIME WE STILL PLAY A LOT OF CARCASSONNE LORDS OF WATERDEEP QUADROPOLIS GUILLOTINE GRAVWELL TRURO OF THE SEAS KINGDOM BUILDER LOST CITIES QWIRKLE SPLENDOR HOKKAIDO TAKENOKO MAN WE'VE GOT A BIG LIST OF GATEWAY GAMES WE PLAY ALL THE TIME WE CAN'T ALWAYS BE PLAYING LACERNA GAMES
MMM RARELY I'D SAY I USUALLY GET THE CHOICE OF WHAT WE PLAY AND I KNOW MOST GAMES I HAVE WELL ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO TEACH THEM WITH MINIMAL ISSUE
SURE I'D HAPPILY PLAY SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM ONE DAY AND SCYTHE THE NEXT
MEDIUM HEAVY IS ABOUT AS LIGHT AS I GO THESE DAYS MY TIME IS LIMITED GAMES ARE WHAT BRING ME JOY I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE FRIENDS THAT AGREE SO THAT HELPS
I TEND TO MIX IT UP I SAVE THE HEAVY GAMES FOR SOLO PLAY AND MORE OF THE LIGHTER GAMES FOR MY GAME GROUP WE ONLY PLAY ONCE A MONTH SO WE'RE STILL NOT DOING THE HEAVIER STUFF I'M NOT SURE THEY'LL EVERY BE INTO A HOUR GAME THOUGH AND I'M OK WITH THAT
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE GROUP MY MONDAY NIGHT GROUP WANTS TO PLAY HEAVY STUFF BUT EVERYONE ELSE I GAME WITH IS EITHER FLEXIBLE WILL PLAY ANY KIND OR PREFERS GAMES

I STILL PLAY AIRLINES EUROPE WONDERS KINGDOM BUILDER AND BONANZA
WE HAVEN'T PLAYED A GATEWAY IN ALMOST A YEAR THE MAJORITY OF WHAT WE PLAY RANGES FROM MADEIRA VINOS CAELUS TO AN WE GAVE AWAY HALF OF OUR GATEWAYS AND ONLY KEPT DOMINION CARCASSONNE AND A FEW OTHERS FOR SAKE
THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE FOR ME BETWEEN GATEWAY GAMES WHERE THE BEST STRATEGIES QUICKLY BECOME OBVIOUS AND OTHERS WHERE THE RULES ARE EASY AND ACTIONS ARE LIMITED BUT THE STRATEGY GOES VERY VERY DEEP KING OF TOKYO IS IN THE FIRST CATEGORY A FUN LIGHT FILLER TR IS IN THE SECOND YOU CAN ALWAYS GET BETTER AT READING AN OPPONENT AND BLOCKING DISGUISING YOUR ROUTES ENDGAME TIMING THURN UND TAXIS SMALL WORLD WATERDEEP ARE ALL DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE GAMES THEY DON'T STAY INTERESTING FOR YOU YOU MAKE THEM INTERESTING AS YOU LEARN TO THINK FURTHER AHEAD AND APPRECIATE SUBTLER STRATEGIES

I TEND TO MOCK ANNOYINGLY BITCH ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH THE EXPRESSION BISHOPS AS IN CHESS HAS GOTTEN SO BORING NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW THE PIECES MOVE AND HAVE EXPERIENCED EVERY KIND OF CAPTURE THERE IS I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE POSSIBLE BISHOPS EXPANSION WHERE THE PIECES ARE DIFFERENT EVERY TIME THAT WILL BRING ENDLESS REPLACEABILITY
ONLY AS
SURE I DO LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS A GREAT GAME BUT IT'S CONSIDERED THE ENTRY WORKER PLACEMENT TITLE HOLDER SPLENDOR SEE MORE PLAY THEN IT SHOULD AND I PLAY THE PATCHWORK APP ALMOST EVERY DAY WITH MY GIRLFRIEND JAMAICA ISN'T THE DEEPEST GAME BUT IT'S STILL FUN AND PRETTY TO LOOK AT

I'VE SINCE SOLD OFF A LOT OF THE OTHER GATEWAY GAMES LIKES SMASH UP AND CH THEY LOST THEIR LUSTER QUICKLY AND MADE ME WISH I HAD TRIED TO PLAY MORE BEFORE I STARTED PURCHASING

BUT I'M LUCKY AND WE'VE BEEN PLAYING NETRUNNER PRETTY HARD LATELY
DEPENDS ON MOOD ARUBA AND BLUE MOON CITY IS VERY AND THEY ARE HERE FOR GOOD
I VERY RARELY PLAY ANYTHING GATEWAY I HAVE GOTTEN RID OF MOST OF MY GATEWAY GAMES AS WELL I WILL SOMETIMES SKI AVOID GAME NIGHTS WHERE THERE IS MORE FOCUS TOWARDS GATEWAY GAMES WHEN I KNOW WHAT CROWD THAT IS COMING
DOESN'T THE CHOICE OF GAMES DEPEND ON THE GUESTS THAT YOU HAVE OVER CATAN CAN STILL BE A GREAT GAME EVEN WHEN YOU ENJOY AGRICOLA SCYTHE OR ECLIPSE WITH OTHER PEOPLE

I RECENTLY READ A POST THAT MADE A CASE AGAINST THE TERM GATEWAY GAMES BECAUSE THAT SUGGESTS YOU WOULD RATHER BE PLAYING SOMETHING ELSE
HECK YEAH

CARCASSONNE HAS HIT MY TABLE JUST ABOUT ONCE A WEEK ON AVERAGE EVERY WEEK OVER THE PAST YEARS AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO HIT MY TABLE FOR THE NEXT YEARS

SOME OF COURSE HAVE DRIFTED OFFICIAL FIVE YEARS AGO I WAS HAPPY PLAYING CATAN I'D RATHER NEVER PLAY THAT AGAIN THOUGH
YES IT HELPS THAT I HAVE KIDS BUT EVEN THE HUSBAND AND I MIGHT PLAY SPLENDOR AND THEN THE ALLERGIST IN ONE SITTING ALL GAMES ARE FAIR GAME

I DON'T EVEN PLAY THEM WITH NEW FOLKS NOW I THINK THERE ARE MORE COMPLEX GAMES MOST INTELLIGENT ADULTS LEARN FINE AS THEIR FIRST GAME


I MEAN YOU CAN PLAY WHAT YOU LIKE THE OTHER GAMES AREN'T SUDDENLY BAD GAMES IF THEY DON'T MATCH YOUR TASTE ANYMORE YOU CAN ALWAYS SELL OFF GAMES YOU'RE NOT INTO ANYMORE AND FREE THAT SHELF SPACE UP

I PERSONALLY STILL A LOT OF THESE GAMES YOU SEEM TO LOOK DOWN ON THEY ARE GOOD FOR INTRODUCING OTHERS INTO BOARD GAMES OR JUST SIMPLE ENOUGH TO PLAY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SIT FOR HOURS ON THE TABLE THINKING ABOUT YOUR CHOICES
ALL OF THE TIME I RUN A TWITCH STREAM AND IT REALLY HELPS TO PLAY SIMPLE GAMES ON IT BUT EVEN IF I WASN'T RUNNING THAT MANY OF MY FAVORITE GAMES ARE KIND OF GATEWAY GAMES RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'D ALMOST NEVER REFUSE A GAME OF SECRET HITLER ONUS JUNK ART CODENAMES AND THE LIST GOES ON
ALCHEMISTS

ARGENT THE CONSORTIUM

DUNGEON PETZ

DUNGEON LORDS
HOW HEAVY OR ACCESSIBLE DO THEY NEED TO BE
LORDS OF THE WATERDEEP AND LEGENDS OF ANDOR COMES TO MIND AS BOTH ARE EURO GAMES
FOR LORDS OF WATERDEEP THE THEME DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH FOR THE GAME ITSELF BUT IT HAS A NICE FEEL TO IT I REALLY ENJOY IT
SOUNDS PRETTY INTERESTING YOU GOT THE NAME WRONG THOUGH BTW
I'D DEFINITELY LIKE TO SEE SOME GAMEPLAY
IN TERMS OF WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF IN TABLE TOP DESIGN WOULD BE REAL TIME GAMES LIKE CAPTAIN SONAR I REALLY ENJOY THE TEAMWORK INVOLVED AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAT CAN BE DONE IN THAT VAIN

SOMETHING ELSE I'VE ENJOYED IS THE PLACEMENT MECHANIC IN ORLEANS AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE MORE WAYS TO USE THAT I'D LOVE TO SEE A LIGHTER GAME THAT JUST FOCUSES MORE CLOSELY ON THAT MECHANIC
MISLEADING BOX ART WHICH GAMES ARE THESE NOW I'M SUPER CURIOUS
LOTUS IS FANTASTIC AND THE RECEPTION TO IT AS FAR AS I'VE SEEN HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE WHAT DO YOU ALL HAVE COMING DOWN THE PIPE NEXT
OH MY GOSH I JUNK ART TO YOU BOTH AT GENION IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER THE FACT THAT I REALIZED YOU WERE THE LOTUS DESIGNERS CONGRATS ON THE SUCCESS I REALLY ENJOY IT AND IT'S SOMETHING THE WIFE AND DAUGHTER BOTH LIKE SO DOUBLE WIN

I'M SURE IT'S BEEN ASKED ELSEWHERE BUT WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR LOTUS WAS THE THEME PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS

OP PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO UPDATE THE PAST MOFW WIKI PAGE WHEN YOU POST THESE
I WOULD LIKE ALL THE PAINTED MINIS FOR MY COMPLETED 2ND EDITION HAHA
GREAT JOB I LIKE YOUR STYLE I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE MORE ROUGH SHADING ON MINIATURES APPEALING MAKES ME WANT TO GO BACK AND PAINT ALL MY DESCENT MINIS
WOW WHAT BRUSHES DO YOU USE I'M JUST GETTING INTO PAINTING WARHAMMER FIGURES AND I'M FINDING IT A PAINT O PAINT THE SMALL DETAILS

ANY TIPS

FIGURES LOOK GREAT BTW ENVIOUS OF YOUR SKILL
IS THAT A SPACE MARINE WITH A BOLTER I NEVER KNEW THEY DID THAT FOR TALISMAN I BET HE WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THE CHAOS WARRIOR
ON THE WEEKEND WE INTRODUCED TWO NEW PLAYERS TO CHICAGO EXPRESS THEY HATED IT THEY COULDN'T WRAP THEIR HEADS AROUND THE FACT THEY AREN'T THE RED PLAYER OR GREEN PLAYER BUT MERELY A PART OWNER IN A COMPANY WITH ACCESS TO THEIR PROFITS AS OWNER OF RED I TANKED THE COMPANY PRETTY BAD AT KEY POINTS AND THAT THOROUGHLY CONFUSED THE OTHER PLAYER WHY WOULD A PERSON WHO PROFITS FROM THE COMPANY DOING WELL NOT CHOOSE THE BEST OPTION TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS HAD TO EXPLAIN THAT I WAS TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE DELTA BETWEEN US WE WERE 2 IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL PROFITS ALONG WITH HOLDING THE MOST CASH AS WELL

I UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF THOUGHT PROCESS COMPARED TO MOST OTHER GAMES ONE THAT TAKES GETTING USED TO WE'RE HOPING TO CONVERT THEM BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE FIVE FOR ANY GAMES IN THE FUTURE

I OFTEN SEE THE SAME MISTAKES BEING MADE IN AGE OF STEAM WHEN PLAYERS FAIL TO EXCLUSIVELY MOVE GOODS OVER OTHERS TRACKS TO MINIMIZE THAT PLAYERS PROFITS
OK WHAT IS THE EASIEST WAY TO PLAY ONLINE PREFERABLY I'D LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO PLAY WITHOUT HAVING TO INSTALL ANY SOFTWARE ANYTHING LIKE BOITEAJEUX OR BOARDGAMEARENA

SHORT OF THIS IT COMES DOWN TO THIS

I'M ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED THAT THERE ISN'T THERE AN ON IOS I'M VERY CLOSE TO BREAKING DOWN AND WRITING ONE MYSELF HOWEVER I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT PATH IF I GET BLOCKED BY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE THERE ARE ANY POPULAR PUBLIC DOMAIN OR CREATIVE COMMONS GAMES OR WHO WOULD I HAVE TO REQUEST PERMISSION TO WRITE AN IOS IMPLEMENTATION OF ONE OR MANY I'M THINKING AS A MINIMUM

I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY HERE EXCEPT TO EXCLAIM THAT I FINALLY GOT MY GMT PRINTED COPY OF I'M ONE OF YOU WELL NOT QUITE YET IT'S MY VERY FIRST GAME I'M A BIT AFRAID OF OPENING IT IT'S STILL IN SHRINK ON MY SHELF PROBLEM IS I DON'T HAVE PLAYERS WILLING TO GET INTO THIS RIGHT NOW SO I DON'T WANT TO GET ALL EXCITED FOR IT I'M GLAD TO HAVE A COPY THOUGH BECAUSE WHEN I DO HAVE A HEAVIER GAMES GROUP IT'LL BE ONE OF THE FIRST I CRACK OUT WITH THEM
I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE NOTICED THAT MUCH KINGMAKING IN MY PLAYS KEEPING IN MIND I'M OFTEN TEACHING NEW PLAYERS OR PLAYING WITH RELATIVELY NEW PLAYERS THERE'S PLENTY OF TEMPORARY COLLUSION INCLUDING FRIENDLY TRACK LAYS OR COMBINED EFFORTS TO FLOAT A NEW COMPANY
I QUITE LIKE BATTLE LINES
THE SO AND I CAN USUALLY WORK OUR WAY THROUGH HANSA TEUTONIA IN ABOUT THAT TIME FRAME YOU HAVE SIMILAR TASTES TO US ALSO JAIPUR OR SPLENDOR
I THINK MOTTAINAI WOULD FIT RIGHT INTO THIS SERIES GLORY TO ROME IF YOU CAN GET IT OF COURSE
IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH DIRECT CONFLICT GAMES THEN CHECK OUT IT'S MY PERSONAL FAVORITE 2 PLAYER GAME PLAYS IN MINUTES
MARGI IS A GREAT CHOICE AND SEEMS DOABLE IF YOU BOTH KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING I WISH I'D PLAY IT MORE
THERE'S LIKE A BILLION 2 PLAYER GAMES THAT ARE MINUTES NEED MORE CONSTRAINTS
TRADERS OF OSAKA NEE TRADERS OF CARTHAGE IS QUITE A NICE FASTER PLAYING GAME IT PLAYS AND I FIND IT BEST WITH 2 BECAUSE EACH PLAYER ADDED REMOVES A LOT OF CONTROL OF THE GAME FROM EACH PLAYER TO THE POINT THAT PLAYER IS TOO CHAOTIC IMO VERY NICE FOR 2 AND NOT BAD AT ALL FOR ATTRACTIVE ARTWORK NICE THEME AND SOME INTERESTING MECHANISM
MOST COMPETITIVE CARD GAMES I'VE PLAYED TAKE LESS THAN AN HOUR NETRUNNER GAME OF THRONES CG ASHES ALL TAKE IN THE MINUTE RANGE

I ESPECIALLY LIKE NETRUNNER FOR EXPERIENCED PLAYERS IN TOURNAMENT PLAY THEY ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE 2 GAMES IN AN HOUR AND THAT GOAL IS MET OF THE TIME THERE WILL BE A RATHER CONSIDERABLE LEARNING CURVE FOR ANY OF THESE GAMES BUT THE REPLACEABILITY THEY OFFER IS UNMATCHED
GALAXY TRUCKER IS BRILLIANT FUN IT HAS JUST STOLEN THE CROWN OF CURRENT FAVOURITE QUICKER GAME FOR ME FROM STAR REALMS OTHERS MY SO AND I PLAY REGULARLY IN THIS SLOT ARE HANAFI SUSHI GO FLASH POINT
BLOODBOW TEAM MANAGER
VÖLUSPÁ MAYBE QWIRKLE IF YOU WANT THE TILE POWERS THEY'RE REALLY FUN THOUGH
HERE'S A GOOD GEEKIEST THAT HAS PLENTY OF SUGGESTIONS
CARCASSONNE GOLD RUSH GREAT WITH ALL PLAYER COUNTS PLAY IT WITH THE WIFE OFTEN REWARDS SKILLFUL PLAY BUT THERE'S ENOUGH LUCK TO SHAKE YOUR EXPECTATIONS
SPLENDOR IS MY GO TO IN THAT TIME FRAME 2 CAN ALSO FINISH A TICKET TO RIDE ESPECIALLY IF NORDIC COUNTRIES OR WONDERS DUEL IN THAT TIME
I WOULD SAY WONDERS THERE'S A REASON WHY THIS GAME IS SO POPULAR AND LIKED
NOTRE DAME FAST AND SMART FELD GAME WITH DRAFTING AND SNOWBALLING AS CENTRAL MECHANISMS GETTING A REPRINT THIS YEAR

PAPERBACK DECKBUILDING WORD GAME GIVEN WHAT SHE LIKES THIS IS A SURE-FIRE WINNER

SPLENDOR SHORT CHINKY
PATCHWORK
WONDERS DUEL
PANDEMIC THE CURE
YOU NEED ARBORETUM IN YOUR LIFE I KIND OF GUFFAWED AT THIS GAME ASSUMING IT TO BE SOME SNOBBY TEA AND CRUMPETS AFFAIR LIKELY TO BE AS DRY AS CHEWING NAPKINS NOPE IT'S TENSE AND THOUGHTFUL ALL THE WAY THROUGH

GOOD JUST SO MANY KINDS OF GOOD GOOD
THE DICE TOWER DID A VIDEO ON THIS A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND THERE'S PROBABLY SOME GOOD RELEVANT DISCUSSION ON THE THREAD ABOUT IT TAKE A LOOK

WE'RE TYPICALLY A 2 PLAYER PARTY AS WELL WITH OCCASIONALLY ONE TO TWO MORE COUPLES WE REALLY ENJOY

CONCORDIA SPECIFICALLY THE BRITTANIA GERMANIA EXPANSION BOARD
SPLENDOR
CARCASSONNE
ALHAMBRA WE IGNORE THE GHOST 3RD PLAYER RULES
LATICES
DOMINION
SAMURAI

THE BOARD GETS BIGGER WITH MORE PLAYERS
GREAT QUESTION LOOKING FORWARD TO EVERYONE'S THOUGHTS AS THIS IS MY SITUATION AS WELL
GHOST STORIES IS GOOD IF YOU WANT A CO-OP IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER THAN PANDEMIC THOUGH SO EXPECT TO LOSE A LOT ALTHOUGH IT DOES HAVE DIFFICULTY SETTINGS THAT YOU CAN ADJUST IF YOU LIKE

SEASONS IS KIND OF SIMILAR TO MAGIC THE GATHERING BUT YOU ALSO ROLL DICE AND SELECT THEM FOR MANA AND ACTIONS AND WHATNOT YOU CAN PLAY IT ON BOARD GAME ARENA IF YOU WANT TO TRY BEFORE YOU BUY

CATACOMBS IS A DEXTERITY GAME WHERE PLAYER IS THE DUNGEON MASTER AND PLAYERS ARE HEROES FIGHTING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DUNGEON YOU FIGHT BY ACTUALLY FLICKING OR SOMETIMES ROLLING DISCS AT EACH STUFF THIS MIGHT BE HARD TO FIND NOW BUT THERE ARE SIMILAR GAMES LIKE FLICK EM UP OUT THERE TOO THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER

SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS IS A GAME WHERE YOU ALL HAVE DUDES ON AN ISLAND AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THEM TO SAFETY BUT YOU CAN GO AFTER OTHER PLAYERS WITH SHARKS AND SEA MONSTERS AND SOMETIMES USE SPECIAL ABILITIES THIS GAME PLAYS BEST AT 2 OR IMO IS A LITTLE AWKWARD BUT YOU CAN DO IT

WELCOME TO THE DUNGEON IS A GREAT SMALL GAME WHERE PLAYERS GOAD EACH OTHER INTO ENTERING A DUNGEON AS THEY GRADUALLY ADD MONSTERS TO IT AND MAKE THE HERO WEAKER EVENTUALLY EVERYONE EXCEPT FOR ONE PLAYER TAPS OUT AND THE REMAINING PLAYER HAS TO TRY TO GO THROUGH IT I PREFER IT AT OR BECAUSE OF THE BANTER BUT IT WORKS WELL AT 2 AS WELL GAMES LAST PROBABLY MINUTES BUT YOU CAN PLAY MULTIPLE ROUNDS
FOR PLAYERS I WOULD RECOMMEND CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AND EIGHT MINUTE EMPIRE IS KIND OF LIKE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY FUN ACTUALLY STRATEGIC AND HAS LOW DRAMA THERE IS ALSO A LOT YOU CAN DO TO CONTROL THE DEPTH OF THE GAME SO YOU CAN HAVE QUICKER LIGHTER GAMES WITH FEWER COMPLEXITIES IF YOU WANT IT ALSO HAS THE BENEFIT OF BEING SMALL ENOUGH TO PLAY ON A SMALL FOLD OUT COUCH TABLE

HOWEVER DON'T BE AFRAID TO INVEST IN SOME STRICTLY GAMES TOO WONDERS DUEL PATCHWORK AND LOST CITIES ALL RUN AND ARE GREAT GREAT GAMES
SOME OF THESE GAMES I PLAYED WITH 2 AND OR BUT NEVER WITH PLAYERS
AMONG THE STARS BUILD YOUR SPACE STATION BY DRAFTING CARDS
SHAKESPEARE EVERY PLAYER RUNS A THEATER HIRES ACTORS AND TRY TO MAKE BEST SHOW AT LEAST THAT'S THE THEME IN REALITY THERE IS BLIND BIDDING WHICH DETERMINES NUMBER OF ACTIONS FOR TURN AS WELL AS PLAYERS ORDER LOW SCORES NEED TO PAY ACTORS AT THE END OR LOOSE POINTS USE CHARACTERS ON ONE TURN BUT REST ON OTHER ETC REALLY GREAT GAME
TRAJAN I WOULD SAY TYPICAL POINT SALAD GAME ONE OF MY FAVORITES IT FEELS LIKE LITTLE GAMES PUT INTO ONE PACKAGE
I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST BIBLIOG DISCOVERIES ROKOKO LORDS OF THE WATERDEEP EXP SPLENDOR ISTANBUL CONCORDIA
QUANTUM GOOD WITH 2 OR

THE 2 PLAYER GAME IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM A PLAYER GAME BUT BOTH VERY GOOD EXPERIENCES
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING NEW DIFFERENT AND ARE OPEN FOR A CTHULHU THEMED GAME CHECK OUT MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME YOU CAN SEE IF YOU LIKE IT WITH THE CORE SET WHICH IS QUITE CHEAP AND START EXPANDING AND PLAYING THE ADDITIONAL CAMPAIGNS WITH EXPANSIONS IT WORKS PERFECTLY WITH TWO PLAYERS AND IS MY CURRENT FAVOURITE STORY DRIVEN GAME FOR TWO PLAYERS IT CAN BE PLAYED WITH FOUR PLAYERS IF YOU OR ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS BUY ANOTHER CORE SET
I RECOMMEND A FEAST FOR ODIN THIS IS A GAME WITH A LOT OF CHOICES AND PATHS THAT IS PRETTY STREAMLINED PLAY WELL WITH ALSO HAS A SOLO VARIANT THAT I HAVE YET TO TRY BUT DOES HAVE A LARGE BUT MODULAR FOOT PRINTING

ANOTHER OPTION IS SMALL WORLD A FUN FANTASY LIGHT WAR GAME WITH NO DICE THE BOARD IS TUNED TO THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS SO SCALES WELL DESPITE THE NUMBER OF PIECES IT DOESN'T TAKE AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF SPACE

LAST ONE I WOULD RECOMMEND IS RACE FOR THE GALAXY A GREAT CARD GAME HAS A SLIGHT LEARNING CURVE BUT SMALL FOOTPRINT NOT EXCESSIVELY LONG AND GOOD


BROOM SERVICE
MARVEL LEGENDARY CO-OP DECK BUILDER SO DOMINION WITH TEAMWORK I LIKE IT BETTER WITH 2 PEOPLE HOWEVER THE CHALLENGES THAT ARISE WITH PEOPLE MAKE IT CUNNER
MYRTLES WOULD BE PERFECT NEARLY AS DIFFICULT IN RULES AS KEYFLOWER BUT JUST AS HEAVY IN STRATEGY AND ITS INTERACTION WITH THE OTHER PLAYERS
LEGENDS OF ANDOR BUT IT ISN'T SMALL FOOTPRINT
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY EMPIRE LEGENDS VITICULTURE LEGACY THE TESTAMENT OF DUKE DE CRECY NEW BEDFORD LOTUS COSMIC RUN

I'LL ALSO SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT SOME 2 GAMES LIKE PATCHWORK JAIPUR MOUSE GUARD SWORDS STRONGHOLDS THUNDER LIGHTNING TIDES OF MADNESS TIDES OF TIME HIVE MR JACK POCKET ETC
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LIGHT EUROGAME SPLENDOR PLAYS GREAT WITH MY WIFE AND I PLAY FREQUENTLY AND HAVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF FUN WITH IT IT'S A CASUAL GAME THAT PLAYS QUICKLY SO DON'T PLAN ON SPENDING THE EVENING ON THAT GAME ALONE

CODENAMES IS FUN AND UNIQUELY DIFFERENT WITH AND PLAYERS WITH 2 IT'S KIND OF LIKE A COOP EFFORT TO BEAT THE AI JUST COVERING UP ONE CARD PER TURN WITH THERE'S BASICALLY A MODERATOR WITH 2 PLAYERS COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER WITH IT'S 2 TEAMS COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER FUN IN ANY COMBINATION AGAIN A LIGHT GAME
I WOULD SAY BLOOD RAGE ITS EVEN DESIGNED TO ADD OR TAKE CARDS AWAY FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE PLAY I ENJOY IT EASY TO LEAD DIFFICULT TO MASTER
SMALL WORLD
FIVE TRIBES SCALES GREAT FROM AND THE BIDDING MECHANIC REALLY CHANGES THE ASPECT OF THE GAME AT DIFFERENT PLAYER COUNTS
YOU MIGHT CHECK OUT INDIGO AS WELL AS LANTERNS THE HARVEST FESTIVAL AND CACAO

I PERSONALLY LIKE NEW YORK AS WELL
FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT STILL VERY MUCH TILE LAYING HAVE A LOOK AT SAMURAI IT'S AN ABSTRACT GAME THAT'S EASY TO PLAY BUT HAS PLENTY OF HIDDEN DEPTH SIMILAR TO CARCASSONNE AND HAS LOTS OF DIRECT PLAYER INTERACTION THE LATEST VERSION OF THIS GAME BY FFA IS JUST BEAUTIFUL
YOU COULD LOOK AT MAHARANI YOU KNOW HER TASTES BETTER THAN ME BUT IT MIGHT WORK YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT VÖLUSPÁ OR MEDINA WOOD NOT TILES BUT IT FEELS LIKE TILE PLACEMENT
I'LL CHIME IN LATE

MY WIFE AND I LOVE TILE GAMES AS WELL AND ARE ONE OF OUR FAVORITE TYPES OF GAMES

I WILL SECOND THE ALREADY MENTIONED LANTERNS AND CACAO BOTH GAMES ARE IN HEAVY ROTATION AT OUR HOUSE

OTHERS TILE GAMES TO CONSIDER THAT WE ALSO ENJOY

CITRUS RADIO HAS A GOOD RUN DOWN ON THIS AND IT IS ONE OF HIS TOP GAMES WE ENJOY IT AS WELL IT'S HARD TO FIND AND I BELIEVE IN THE STATES IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE THROUGH MINIATURE MARKET AS AN IMPORT COPY

TAKENOKO NOT A PURE TILE LAYER HOWEVER IT IS DEFINITELY A PART OF THE GAME TAKENOKO PLAYS LIGHT LIKE CARCASSONNE BUT HAS AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE CONFLICT AS YOU CARE TO PLAY LOOKS GREAT ON THE TABLE TOO

IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO ADDING TRADERS AND BUILDERS AS WELL AS INNS AND CATHEDRALS CARCASSONNE EXPANSIONS TO THE VANILLA MIX DEFINITELY RAMPS UP THE DIRECT INTERACTION OF CARCASSONNE AND MAKES IT MUCH MORE STRATEGIC

WE LIKE NEW YORK BUT IT'S VERY LIGHT EVEN LIGHTER THAN CARCASSONNE AND TICKET TO RIDE WHILE IT PLAYS ON A CENTRAL BOARD PLAYERS ARE STILL BASICALLY PLAYING WITHIN THEIR OWN DOMAIN AND THERE IS LITTLE INTERACTION OTHER THAN TRYING TO BE THE FIRST TO CAPTURE THE BEST PLACES ON THE BOARD IT'S GOOD BUT MAY NOT SCRATCH THE SAME ITCH AS CARCASSONNE DOES
A COUPLE MORE I DIDN'T SEE MENTIONED KINGDOMS AND QIN
TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES IS ALMOST LITERALLY THE COMBINATION OF TILE LAYING ON A CENTRAL BOARD WITH DIRECT PLAYER INTERACTION IT IS ALSO A MASTERPIECE DO CHECK IT OUT
HOW DOES SHE FEEL ABOUT TRAINS IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER THAN THERE IS AN AVERSION I WOULD SUGGEST RAILWAYS OF THE WORLD TILE LAYING TO CREATE ROUTES TO MOVE GOOD ACROSS GET THE BEST CONNECTIONS IT'S A STEP UP FROM CARCASSONNE BUT IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT GAME MY WIFE AND EVERYONE I'VE EVER PLAYED INWITH HAS LOVED IT
OH WHAT A YEAR IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER

MACHS VS MINIONS
MANSIONS OF MADNESS SECOND EDITION
MARKHAM HORROR CG
LONDON DREAD

BAR IS PRETTY HIGH FOR TSH
MACHS VS MINIONS
MACHS VS MINIONS IS LIKELY MY GAME OF THE YEAR JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CHAOS AND CONTROL FOR A CO-OP GAME
I HAVE IT PLAYED IT BUT THE MOST WELL RECEIVED CO-OP OF AT LEAST IN BG RATING MIGHT BE PANDEMIC IBERIA
BLACK ORCHESTRA I THINK THIS JUST CAME OUT
NOT OUT THIS YEAR BUT NEW TO ME EIGHT EPICS BY SEIJI KANAI ITS VERY DIFFICULT BUT SUPER FUN TRAVEL SIZE AND ONLY AS A DOWNSIDE IT SUFFERS THE ALPHA LEADER PROBLEM BUT ALSO PLAYS WELL SOLO

BOARDGAME
OTHERS HERE WILL DISAGREE BUT MY GROUP PLAYS THE HELL OUT OF ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE
BEYOND BAKER STREET
YOU'RE A TEAM OF DETECTIVES TRYING TO HOLMES IT'S A SMALL SHORT GAME COULD ACTUALLY BE PLAYED WITH A STANDARD DECK OF CARDS BUT THE THEME MAKES IT EASIER TO EXPLAIN THE RULES
HARRY POTTER HOGWARTS BATTLE ACTUALLY SEEMS PRETTY GOOD SO FAR IT'S A CO-OP DECKBUILDER
THE RAVENS OF HRI SAHASHRI ONLY
WHERE IS TIME STORIES O
NEVER GET AN EXPANSION THINKING IT WILL FIX A GAME FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE GAME GETTING AN EXPANSION WON'T FIX IT I PERSONALLY CANNOT PLAY LOW WITHOUT THE EXPANSION BUT WITH TEH EXPANSION ITS A GREAT GAME WHICH I STILL SOMETIMES EVEN PLAY JUST BECAUSE ITS A PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD GAME AND OFFERS A LOT OF OPTIONS AND A C

VITICULTURE AND AGRICOLA ARE BOTH VERY FUN GAMES AND I REALLY LIKE BOTH YOU REALLY CANNOT GO WRONG WITH EITHER AGRICOLA IS PROBABLY THE HEAVIER GAME BUT VITICULTURE HAS MORE THEME TO IT IMO
I DOUBT SKULLPORT WILL SAVE LOW FOR YOU IT DEFINITELY IMPROVES THE GAME BUT DON'T EXPECT IT TO RENEW YOUR INTEREST IF YOU'RE FEELING READY TO MOVE ON

FOR DEEPER WITH THEME YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT YEDO

AGRICOLA IS A GOOD SOLID CHOICE FOR WP AS WELL
I REALLY LIKE LORDS OF WATERDEEP AND THE EXPANSION IMPROVES IT A LOT IT'S HARD TO SAY IF IT WILL FIX IT FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE IT VITICULTURE I ALSO LOVE HAVEN'T PLAYED AS MUCH THOUGH BUT IS ONLY MARGINALLY MORE COMPLEX I ALSO LIKE AGRICOLA BUT DESPITE BEING WORKER PLACEMENT IS VERY DIFFERENT TO THE OTHERS BEING MORE ABOUT SUSTAINING YOURSELF INSTEAD OF COMPLETING QUESTS ORDERS I REALLY LIKE THE WORKER PLACEMENT SYSTEM SO ITS HARD TO KNOW IF MY RECOMMENDATION MEANS MUCH
THE MANHATTAN PROJECT IS BASICALLY LOW FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE LOW AND WANT A GOOD THEME THATS PROBABLY WHAT I'D RECOMMEND

ARGENT THE CONSORTIUM IS THE LOGICAL STEP UP FROM LOW IN TERMS OF COMPLEXITY AND DEPTH I'M NOT SURE IT FITS TOO WELL WITH CLEAN GAMEPLAY AND SHORT SET UP TIME ITS MORE OF AN EVERYTHING AND THE KITCHEN SINK TOO AND THATS BEFORE EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE EXPANSION
I DON'T REALLY LIKE LORDS OF WATERDEEP ALL THAT MUCH I PREFER AGRICOLA AND NEW BEDFORDSHIRE BUT MORE THAN ALL OF THOSE I PREFER VITICULTURE I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING V EE AND IF YOU NEED MORE TO IT THAN THAT GRAB TUSCANY EE TOO

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING WITH A TON OF CHOICES I HEAR A FEAST FOR ODIN IS GREAT
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND VITICULTURE I ALSO WANTED TO GET A GAME TO FILL THE WORKER PLACEMENT GAP IN MY COLLECTION AND DECIDED TO SPLURGE ON THE 2ND EDITION WITH TUSCANY I HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO PLAY WITH MOST OF THE EXPANSION YET SOME OF WHICH THE EE COMES WITH AND EVERYONE I'VE PLAYED IT WITH HAS ENJOYED IT

I THINK THE TRICK IS THE GAME IS SIMPLE ENOUGH TO CATCH ON QUICK AND HAVE A GOOD TIME PLAYING WHILE HAVING ENOUGH DEPTH THAT MY F SEEMS TO WIN MORE OFTEN THAN NOT

THE THEME IS GOOD THINGS LIKE AGEING YOUR WINE HELP SELL IT THOUGH WORKER PLACEMENT THEME BREAKS ARE PRESENT WHY WOULD SOMEONE HARVESTING THEIR FIELD PREVENT ME FROM HARVESTING MINE

SETUP IS FAST NOT QUITE AS QUICK AS ROLL FOR THE GALAXY BUT FASTER THAN MACHS VS MINIONS LOVE BOTH THOSE GAMES BTW

I CAN'T COMPARE TO ANY OTHER WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES THOUGH AS NOTHING IN THE GENRE HAS GRABBED MY INTEREST SINCE GETTING VITICULTURE
I'VE ONLY PLAYED LORDS OF WATERDEEP THE THEME THAT DOES EXIST WHICH ISN'T VERY STRONG DIDN'T APPEAL TO ME THEREFORE I SOLD IT I MUCH PREFERRED STONE AGE AS AN INTRO WORKER PLACEMENT GAME BECAUSE THE THEME MADE A LOT MORE SENSE TO MAKE I RECENTLY GOT CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD FOR FREE TO REVIEW TRY OUT I'VE READ THAT THE VIKING THEME IS REALLY GOOD IN THAT GAME AND IS A MINOR STEP UP FROM STONE AGE IN TERMS OF COMPLEXITY WORKER PLACEMENT TABLETOP I BELIEVE HAS VIDEOS OF LORDS OF WATERDEEP STONE AGE AND RECENTLY DID CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HEAVIER WORKER PLACEMENT MAYBE CAVERN OR AGRICOLA AS YOU MENTIONED I WOULD SAY THEY ARE FAIRLY MORE COMPLEX THAN LORDS OF WATERDEEP I SOLD MY COPY OF AGRICOLA BECAUSE THE SET UP TOOK AWHILE AND I PREFER PLAYING THE IOS VERSION
ALRIGHT SO A BIT ABOUT ME SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE I'M COMING FROM

I LOVE SUPER HEAVY GAMES GAMES LIKE TERRA MYSTIC ARE MY GAME OF CHOICE ANY DAY I ALSO LOVE SCYTHE AND FIVE TRIBES WAS MY FIRST BIG BOY GAME I EVER BOUGHT

FOR THE LONGEST TIME I ONLY PLAYED THE GAME WITH EXPANSIONS IT'S HONESTLY HOW I THINK THE GAME SHOULD BE PLAYED AT ALL TIMES

HOWEVER WHEN I GOT THE APP IT REALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WAS WITH ONLY ONE PLACE FOR ADVENTURERS AT EACH TURN MAKING YOUR MOVES BECOMES WELL I GUESS I HAVE TO WAIT A TURN TO DO THIS QUEST BECAUSE SOMEONE HAPPENED TO TAKE THE ROGUES

IN THE EXPANSION YOU'RE MAKING DECISIONS LIKE DO I WANT TO TAKE LESS THINGS THIS TURN AND TURN THIS IN OR MAYBE GET A CORRUPTION TOKEN OR MAYBE JUST WAIT UNTIL NEXT TURN IT GIVES YOU SO MANY MORE INTERESTING DECISIONS AND ALSO MAKES THE GAME SO MUCH FASTER WITH CORRUPTION

DOES THIS ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
BLDG TO ME WAS FASTER AND MORE FRENETIC FUN PLUS ENJOYED HIDDEN ROLES MORE THE DICE FACES WERE MORE INTERESTING THAN AND I DISLIKE FUSE SINCE I DISLIKE REAL TIME
WE OWN OR HAVE OWNED ALL OF THESE FUSE FELL FLAT WITH MY FAMILY BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT NO ONE BUT ME LIKES TIMED GAMES BUMMER TRADED IT BANG THE DICE GAME IS LOTS OF FUN BUT REALLY SHINES AT HIGHER PLAYER COUNTS KING OF TOKYO IS BY FAR ONE OF OUR FAVORITES WE REALLY ENJOY TAKE THAT ELEMENTS IN GAMES AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE SATISFYING THAN CHUCKING DICE AND ATTACKING YOUR LOVED ONES



IF YOU'RE PLAYING WITH A LOW NUMBER I CAN'T SUGGEST BANG IF NOT HOWEVER YOU REALLY CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANY OF THEM I'D RECOMMEND KOT OVER JUST ABOUT ANYTHING THOUGH SO I MAY BE A LITTLE BIASED
I LIKE BANG THE DICE GAME A LOT MORE THAN FUSE I HAVEN'T PLAYED KING OF TOKYO YET I HAVE CONSIDERED BUYING IT BUT WHEN I WATCH VIDEOS IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK THAT GOOD I THINK I'D HAVE TO PLAY IT BEFORE BUYING IT REALLY

LIKE ANOTHER COMMENTER SAID I'D RATHER BE PLAYING ANOTHER SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAME THAN BANG THE DICE GAME AND MY DRUG OF CHOICE IS DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY THE RESISTANCE NEITHER HAS DICE THOUGH

SO AS FAR AS GAMES GO COMPARED TO FUSE I'D MUCH RATHER PLAY ROLL FOR THE GALAXY PANDEMIC THE CURE MARVEL DICE MASTERS ULTIMATE KINGSBURG OR COSMIC RUN PERSONALLY COSMIC RUN BEING THE LIGHTEST IN THAT GROUPING I THINK FUSE IS UNIQUE THOUGH SO THERE'S THAT I JUST DON'T FIND IT FUN AT ALL JUST ANNOYING AND STRESSFUL AND NOT REALLY IN A GOOD WAY
I'VE GOT BANG CDG AND KING OF TOKYO

I PREFER BANG BECAUSE I HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART FOR SOCIAL DEDUCTION MISDIRECTION AND HIDDEN INFORMATION IT'S EVEN BETTER WITH THE OLD SALOON EXPANSION BECAUSE THE FIRST PERSON ELIMINATED BECOMES A GHOST AND STILL INFLUENCES THE GAME THERE'S A DICE TO PROMOTE HEALING AND ONE FOR DESPERATE ATTACKS

KING OF TOKYO IS MORE FAMILY FRIENDLY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET PICKED ON YOU LEAVE TOKYO THE UPGRADE POWERS KEEP IT FEELING FRESH EACH TIME MY WIFE WON HER FIRST GAME WITH HERBIVORE POWER ALL SHE DID WAS ROLL HEARTS AND VICTORY POINTS
I'VE PLAYED ALL THREE AND THEY ARE ALL GOOD THEY FILL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NICHES THERE'S SO MANY GAMES IN THE HOBBY THAT USE DICE THAT THE IDEA THAT YOU NEED A DICE GAME IS A BIT SILLY

BANG AND KING OF TOKYO HAVE PLAYER ELIMINATION SO THAT'S ONE NEGATIVE AGAINST THEM IT'S WORSE FOR KING OF TOKYO THE GAME CAN SOMETIMES RESULT IN ONE PLAYER GETTING UNLUCKY AND OUT IN THE FIRST MINUTES AND THEN TAKING ANOTHER MINUTES TO FINISH BANG THE DICE GAME TENDS TO HAVE MORE DAMAGE GOING OUT EACH ROUND THAN IS POSSIBLE TO HEAL SO ONCE PLAYERS START TO DIE THE GAME GETS PRETTY QUICK MAYBE ANOTHER OR MINUTES

BANG HOWEVER PLAYS MUCH BETTER WITH OR MORE PEOPLE IT'S PRETTY AVERAGE WITH AND I WOULDN'T PLAY IT WITH KING OF TOKYO IS GOOD BUT I'D SAY A MAX OF OR PLAYING WITH IS A LOT OF DOWNTIME AND IF YOU GET ELIMINATED EARLY IT SUCKS

FUSE IS CO-OP SO EVERYONE PLAYS AT ONCE IT'S FUN BIT TENSE AT TIMES BUT LIKE MOST IT CAN STILL SUFFER FROM BEING SOLVED THERE'S SOME OBVIOUS RIGHT MOVES AND SOME OF THE TASKS YOU HAVE TO DO ARE OBJECTIVELY EASIER HARDER SO THERE'S GOOD REASONS TO GIVE PRIORITY OF DICE TO ONE TASK OR ANOTHER THE REAL TIME ASPECT DOES HELP A BIT WITH IT BUT ONCE YOU'VE DEVELOPED A SYSTEM WHICH WILL HAPPEN IF YOU PLAY IT ENOUGH IT BECOMES ROUTINE
FUSE IS A VERY VERSATILE GAME IT PLAYS WELL SOLO ETC IT'S ALSO A REAL-TIME GAME WHICH IS A RARE THING THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY EXPERIENCE OUT OF YOUR OPTIONS I'D CONSIDER IT A
KING OF TOKYO HAS PROBABLY BROUGHT THE MOST JOY BUT I REALLY ENJOY THE TENSION OF FUSE
I HAVEN'T PLAYED FUSE BUT I OWN THE OTHER 2 KING OF TOKYO IS WHAT I PULL OUT WITH OR LESS PLAYERS BANG THE DICE GAME CONES OUT ABOVE THAT

KOT TO ME SLOWS DOWN TOO MUCH ONCE YOU GET ABOVE OR SO PLAYERS BANG DOESN'T REALLY GET FUN UNTIL YOU'VE GOT OR MORE IN MY EYES ITS PRETTY BORING WITH JUST OR
FUSE IS MY FAVORITE I LOVE THE SET PLAY TIME SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE IN FOR AND I LOVE THAT IS A LITTLE BIT CHINKY WITHOUT ANY ROOM FOR AP AND I LOVE THE CRAZY COMMUNICATION CHAOS WORKING ALL TOGETHER TRYING TO DECIDE WHO GETS WHAT BUT SINCE EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN BOMBS AND YOU ARE UNDER PRESSURE WITH THE TIME LIMIT YOU CAN'T REALLY QUARTERBACK BUT YOU CAN STILL TRY HEH SO YOU DON'T NEED TO RESTRAIN YOURSELF IF YOUR THE TYPE THAT DOES THAT AND I LOVE THE RANDOMIZATION WITH NOT KNOWING WHAT DICE YOU ARE GOING TO GRAB AS WELL WHAT WILL BE ROLLED OR WHAT BOMBS WILL COME UP NEXT SO WHILE THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PLANNING WITH WHAT'S AVAILABLE IS NOT A PERFECT PUZZLE AND WE JUST REALLY FEEL THE TENSION OF THE THEME IN THIS GAME

HAVING SAID THAT BLDG GETS THE MOST PLAY IT'S JUST SO EASY TO GET OUT AS WELL AS TAKE ON THE ROAD WITH US AND THERE'S ALMOST NO SET UP AND CAN GET PLAYED EVEN WHEN WE ARE BURNT OUT AT THE END OF THE DAY AND SHORT ON TIME

ON THE OTHER HAND WHILE IT'S MY LEAST FAVORITE OF THE KOT IS THE EASIEST TO BRING OUT WITH NONGAMERS IT'S THE ONLY ONE OF THE I CAN GET MY MOTHER TO PLAY AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE EASIEST TO GARNER IMMEDIATE INTEREST FOR NEW PLAYERS AND FOR THEM TO QUICKLY GRASP AND BEGIN PLAYING WITHOUT FEELING AWKWARD OR BREAKING THE GAME SOMEHOW BY MISUNDERSTANDING A RULE DURING PLAY
I FOUND KOT TO BE PRETTY BORING PERSONALLY WE OWN IT BUT I GOT TIRED OF IT QUICK FUSE IS GREAT IT'S FRANTIC CHAOTIC FUN AND I LOVE BRINING IT OUT ESPECIALLY AT TWO PLAYERS CAN'T SPEAK TO BANG
I KNOW I HAVE AN UNPOPULAR OPINION BUT FUSE IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE OUT OF ALL THOSE GAMES WHENEVER I PLAY BANG I'D RATHER BE PLAYING ANY OF THE OTHER PLETHORA OF SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES OUT THERE AND WHENEVER I'M PLAYING KING OF TOKYO IT'S JUST NOT THAT INTERESTING TO ME

FUSE THOUGH IS ALMOST ON THAT SAME LEVEL AS HANAFI FOR ME WHERE I PLAY IT I RARELY EVER WIN BUT I ALWAYS SEE MYSELF AND THE OTHER PLAYERS GETTING BETTER
I LOVE THIS GAME DON'T UNDERSTAND AT ALL THE SHIT IT'S TAKING OUR GROUP ALREADY GOT ANOTHER COPY TO PLAY AGAIN GUESS I'LL HAVE TO BUY ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS SEQUEL HAPPEN
THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR I'VE REALLY BEEN ENJOYING OUR PLAYTHROUGH
MY GROUP IS HAVING A BLAST WITH IT I WOULD TRY A SEQUEL
WELL THE RESPONSE TO THE FIRST ONE WAS DEFINITELY MIXED IN SOME CORNERS BUT WITH THE BENEFIT OF EXPERIENCE I IMAGINE ANY SEQUELS WILL BE MORE POLISHED

I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ALSO CAME IN WITH THE WRONG EXPECTATIONS PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING SOMETHING LIKE PANDEMIC LEGACY WHICH WAS VERY EASY TO LEARN AND PLAYED FAST

GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE
I WOULD GLADLY GIVE THIS GAME A GO HOWEVER FINDING A FEW DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL STICK IT THROUGH TIL THE END IS HOLDING ME BACK
SO NO
WELL THAT'S ONE WAY TO TRY TO SQUEEZE A FEW EXTRA SALES OUT AN UNDERPERFORMING GAME

MAYBE MAKE A VERSION OF SEAWALL PANDEMIC LEGACY WORKS BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW PANDEMIC
I HAVE NOT PLAYED SEAWALL BUT IF I DID AND WANTED A SEQUEL LET ME DECISIONS FROM SEAWALL MOVE TO SEAWALL 2 ALSO DON'T GIVE ME A MASS EFFECT ENDING IF YOU'RE READING THIS CREATORS
I PERSONALLY DISLIKE THE RANDOM CARD LINE OF ASCENSION STAR REALMS AND DC DECKBUILDER WITH DOMINION THE FEELING OF PLANNING AND TIMING YOUR PURCHASE ORDER IS A BIT STRONGER THAT BEING SAID THE RANDOM ELEMENTS AND SIMPLIFIED CHOICES MAKES THOSE GAMES MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE AND A BIT MORE REPAYABLE TO SOME DEGREE
ONE THING NO ONE MENTIONED YET DOMINION IS THE KING OF REPLACEABILITY IN MY MIND MANY GAMES REVEAL THEIR STRATEGY WITHIN A FEW PLAYS SO THAT HE THINKING PART OF THE GAME LOSES ITS FUN BECAUSE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS THAT BECOME AVAILABLE WHEN CHOOSING THE KINGDOM CARDS ESPECIALLY WITH A FEW EXPANSIONS EVERY GAME HAS A FRESH PUZZLE AND REQUIRES NEW THOUGHT FOR THAT REASON DOMINION WILL KEEPING MAKING IT TO MY TABLE AGAIN AND AGAIN
DOMINION CERTAINLY HAS THE DRIER THEME AND SETUP IS A NUISANCE BUT IT HAS A LOT TO RECOMMEND IT OVER ASCENSION THE TWO BIGGEST GAMEPLAY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DOMINION AND ASCENSION ARE THAT ASCENSION HAS TWO MAIN RESOURCE TYPES OTHER THAN VP AND THAT THE CARDS AVAILABLE TO BE BOUGHT OR KILLED WHATEVER ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND IT CAN VERY WELL BE ARGUED THAT THESE ARE BOTH CHANGES FOR THE WORST INDEED THE DOMINION DESIGNER DELIBERATELY AVOIDED THEM FOR A REASON

HAVING TWO RESOURCE TYPES MEANS THAT QUITE OFTEN YOU DRAW A CRAPPY HAND WITH A LITTLE OF BOTH BUT NOT ENOUGH TO BUY SOMETHING GOOD THAT'S A REALLY NASTY UNFUR SOURCE OF BAD LUCK THE ALCHEMY EXPANSION OF DOMINION INTRODUCES A SECOND RESOURCE FOR BUYING THINGS POTIONS AND DOES SO IN A VERY CAREFUL MANNER IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THESE PROBLEMS NO CARD COSTS MORE THAN ONE POTION SO YOU NEVER GET A HAND THAT'S HALF POTIONS YOU TYPICALLY ONLY HAVE ONE IN YOUR DECK EVEN STILL THIS IS BY FAR THE LEAST POPULAR DOMINION EXPANSION

HAVING A CARD MARKET THAT CONSTANTLY CHANGES MEANS YOU CAN'T REALLY PLAN AHEAD MUCH IF YOU TRY TO BUILD AN INTERESTING DECK AROUND SOME UNUSUAL STRATEGY COMBO SYNERGY AND THEN THE CARDS FOR THAT DECK DON'T BECOME AVAILABLE YOU'RE SUNK SO YOU WIND UP PLAYING EVERY GAME WITH THE SAME GENERIC FLEXIBLE STYLE THAT'S NOT AN ABSOLUTE STATEMENT YOU STILL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S IN YOUR DECK AND WHETHER THE NEW CARD YOU'RE BUYING WOULD FIT IN BUT RELATIVE TO DOMINION THERE IS A LOT LESS VARIETY IN DECK TYPES

THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THE ASCENSION MARKET ROW IS BOTH PLAYERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME CARDS IF I GET A REALLY GREAT CARD IN THE OPENING THAT SUCKS FOR YOU YOU'D HOPE THAT THIS TYPE OF LUCK WOULD AVERAGE OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE GAME AND YOU MIGHT SAY THE SAME ABOUT THE DUAL RESOURCE SYSTEM BUT THE NATURE OF DECKBUILDING GAMES IS THAT A SMALL LEAD IN THE EARLY GAME CAN SNOWBALL REALLY HARD THAT FIRST GREAT CARD LETS YOU GET MORE GREAT CARDS WHICH IN TURN GET YOU MORE GREAT CARDS SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY LUCKY LATER AND OR OUTPLAY ME SIGNIFICANTLY IF I GET A LUCKY BREAK AT THAT STAGE

FINALLY PERSONALLY I FIND THERE ARE JUST A LOT OF DECISIONS IN ASCENSION BECAUSE YOU HAVE UNLIMITED ACTIONS YOU NEVER REALLY HAVE TO THINK WHETHER A GIVEN CARD WILL HURT YOUR HAND OR DECK ESPECIALLY IF THAT CARD HAS DRAW A CARD
THANKS FOR ALL OF THE OPINIONS I CAN SEE WHERE THE DISLIKE FOR ASCENSION COMES FROM ANYONE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE ORDER IN WHICH TO DIVE INTO DOMINION EXPANSIONS AND HOW TO STORE THEM
ALTERNATIVE ANSWER CHECK OUT VALLEY OF THE KINGS IT HAS A DYNAMIC SETUP BUT YOU CAN ACTIVELY INFLUENCE IT WITH YOUR CARD PLAY IT ALSO INVOLVES A UNIQUE SET MAKING MECHANIC IN DECK BUILDING WHEREIN YOU'RE ALWAYS DECIDING WHETHER TO USE YOUR CARD NOW OR MAKE SURE IT SCORES AT THE END THE BEST PART IT'S SUPER CHEAP AND THERE'S ONLY 2 EXPANSIONS
I LIKE THEM BOTH AND I THINK THEY SCRATCH DIFFERENT ITCHES DOMINION IS FOR WHEN I WANT TO MULL OVER MY CARD CHOICES AND BUILD UP AN ENGINE BASED ON THE STATIC KINGDOM IN FRONT OF ME

ASCENSION IS FOR WHEN I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO THINK VERY HARD JUST TOSS MY HAND ON THE TABLE AND KILL SOME STUFF FOR LITTLE PLASTIC GEMS

IT'S A LITTLE EASIER TO GET FOLKS TO PLAY ASCENSION BECAUSE IT'S FLASHIER AND LOOKS MORE LIKE MAGIC IT ALSO HAS A BOARD AND FIDDLY BITS IT GOES PRETTY FAST EVEN WITH HIGH PLAYER COUNTS

GIVEN THE CHOICE I'LL ALMOST ALWAYS CHOOSE DOMINION THOUGH BECAUSE I ENJOY STRATEGIC GAMES MORE THAN TACTICAL ONES THE RANDOM MARKET IN ASCENSION MAKES THINGS TOO MUCH ABOUT REACTING FOR ME RATHER THAN THOUGHTFUL ACQUISITION AND EXECUTION OF COMBOS
DOMINION IS A MUCH HEAVIER GAME MUCH LESS CHANCE INVOLVED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE THE ENTIRE GAME THERE'S MORE STRATEGY IN HOW TO BUY WHAT AND WHEN

I'M AN AVID STAR REALMS PLAYER ASCENSION SCRATCHES THE SAME ITCH BUT IT'S SLOWER AND LESS DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE DOMINION FEELS SLOWER AND UNLESS YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE ATTACKS THERE IS NO PLAYER INTERACTION

I OWN ALL ENJOY ALL BUT STAR REALMS IS MY GO TO DECK BUILDER I ENJOY DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE GAMES AND SIGNIFICANT PLAYER INTERACTION
ASCENSION VS DOMINION COMES DOWN TO STRATEGY VS TACTICS IN DOMINION YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MARKET AND DECIDE HOW YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY THE GAME SURE YOU HAVE TO WATCH YOUR OPPONENT AND MAKE SUBTLE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON HOW WELL THE GAME IS GOING FOR EACH OF YOU AND HOW SOON YOU EXPECT THE GAME TO END BUT ALL OF THAT IS MINOR ASCENSION ON THE OTHER HAND IS A GAME OF CONSTANT DECISIONS EACH TURN YOU LOOK AT THE AVAILABLE CARDS AND DECIDE WHICH OF THEM IS GOING TO WORK WELL WITH WHAT IS ALREADY IN YOUR DECK

MOST OF THE BOARD GAME FANS ARE INTERESTED IN HEAVY EUROS THEY LIKE THE STRATEGIC CERTAINTY OF DOMINION OVER THE UNPREDICTABLY OF ASCENSION

I VASTLY PREFER ASCENSION OVER ANY FIXED MARKET DECK BUILDER THAT I HAVE EVER PLAYED I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT THOUGH I WOULD RECOMMEND STAR REALMS LEGENDARY MARVEL OR BRASS EMPIRE THEY HAVE ALL TAKEN THE BASIC ASCENSION DECK BUILDING AND ADDED A TWIST TO IT THAT KEEPS IT THE CENTER OF THE GAME BUT MAKES IT MORE INTERESTING AS FOR THE ASCENSION EXPANSIONS WHEN I TRIED THEM I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE SOLID AND WELL DESIGNED BUT VERY GIMMICKY
HAS ANYONE MENTIONED THIS IS EURO VS AMERICAN
I'M MORE OF AN ASCENSION FAN MYSELF IT'S JUST MORE EXCITING TO PLAY AND LOOK AT THAN DOMINION WHICH IS MOSTLY A MATTER OF TASTE ASCENSION IS JUST MORE PLEASING FOR ME TO LOOK AT AND MORE EXCITING TO PLAY THE GAME THRIVES ON MAKING THOSE INSANE COMBOS BEING THE PERSON WHO MANAGED TO GRAB THAT HIGH POWERED CARD OR DENYING IT FROM OTHERS AND IT ALWAYS FEELS GOOD WHEN YOU HAVE A PILE OF LITTLE PLASTIC GEMS IN FRONT OF YOU

DOMINION WELL IT KINDA FEELS LIKE DECK BUILDING FOR THE SAKE OF DECK BUILDING AND AS SUCH I FIND IT A BIT DULL IT DOESN'T HELP THAT I'VE PLAYED GAMES THAT USE THE DOMINION STYLE MARKETPLACE THAT I ENJOYED MUCH MORE LIKE TRAINS ARCTIC SCAVENGERS THEY GIVE A CLEAR INTERESTING AND VERY THEMATIC PURPOSE FOR WHY YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF BUILDING A DECK WHICH JUST HELPS ME BE MORE INVESTED IN PLAYING JUST TRYING TO COLLECT CARDS WITH POINT VALUES ON THEM DOESN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING FOR ME
THE THING THAT BOTHERS MOST PEOPLE ABOUT ASCENSION IS THE CARD DISPLAY MECHANIC CAN'T REMEMBER IT'S NAME BUT HOW ALL CARDS ARE SHUFFLED INTO ONE DECK AND ARE DRAWN TO MAKE UP THE MARKET IT CAN MAKE THINGS REALLY SWINGY IN A COMPETITIVE GAME UNLIKE THE LEGENDARY GAMES THAY ALSO USE THIS MECHANIC BECAUSE WHO CARES IF IT'S A COOP GAME ASCENSION HAS ALSO FALLEN ASIDE BECAUSE A THE APP IS OUT AND IT'D EASIER TO PLAY GAMES THERE B OTHER GAMES EG THE LEGENDARY SERIES HAVE IMPROVED UPON IT SO MUCH APP BY CONTRAST IS PRETTY BLAH LAST TIME I CHECKED

IN CONTRAST DESIGN IS MORE ELEGANT AND LESS RELIANT ON LUCK BESIDES THE NATURAL LUCK OF DRAWING YOUR HAND YOU KNOW WHAT'S ON THE TABLE AND CAN PLAN ACCORDINGLY I'M NO LONGER AS BIG OF A FAN OF THE GAME AS I ONCE WAS BECAUSE THE RIDICULOUS ENGINES AND POWERFUL ATTACKS CAN MAKE THE GAME VERY BORING FOR OTHER PLAYERS WHO MUST WAIT ON YOUR TURN
ASCENSION IS FULL OF BAD ANG ITS REALLY THAT SIMPLE ITS A SHALLOW GIMMICK
YOU WANTED A LIST
PAX PORFIRIANA
KEYFLOWER
LEWIS CLARK
ROKOKO
COAL BARON
VILLAGE VILLAGE INN EXP
SNOWDONIA
BRUXELLES
SHAKESPEARE
SEASONS

TRAJAN
SUBURBIA IT DOES LOOK ABSTRACT BUT FOR ME IT IS CLOSEST TO CITY BUILDING YOU ARE TRYING TO BUILD UP YOUR ECONOMIC ENGINE INCOME REPUTATION POPULATION TO BE SUSTAINABLE IN ORDER TO GROW YOUR BOROUGH GREAT GAME
MOMBASA MAY BE A BIT OF A STEP UP IN TERMS OF COMPLEXITY FROM THE CURRENT GAMES YOU ENJOY BUT TAL A GREAT GAME JUST A LITTLE TOWARDS THE HEAVY END OF MEDIUM WEIGHT GAMES

MAYBE CHECK OUT CONCORDIA I'VE HAD VERY GOOD REACTIONS FROM TEACHING GAMERS THAT LOVE CATAN
KINGDOM BUILDER
THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT GAMES TO CHOOSE FROM JUST FROM

MOMBASA IS VERY GOOD BUT I MIGHT ENJOY NEWEST GAME EVEN MORE THAT IS GREAT WESTERN TRAIL

TERRAFORMING MARS HAS ALSO COME OUT THIS YEAR AND IT'S AN AMAZING GAME I JUST WANT TO PLAY IT OVER AND OVER

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE PLAYED ANY OF UWE GAMES BUT HIS NEWEST ONE A FEAST FOR ODIN IS ANOTHER BIG HEAVY AND AMAZING GAME

OTHER THAN THAT SUBURBIA IS GREAT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING LIGHTER THAN THE ONES I HAVE RECOMMENDED THERE IS OOOO MANY VIDEOS ON BEST GAMES IN MANY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO THOSE SHOULD GIVE YOU A LOT OF HELP TOO
EXCELLENT GAME IT HAS QUICKLY BECOME ONE OF MY MORE REQUESTED GAMES AT METUMPS EASY TO TEACH SHORT PLAY TIME BUT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A FILLER VARIABLE SCORING TILES MAKE EVERY GAME FEEL DIFFERENT PLAYS BEST WITH MORE PLAYERS THOUGH I'LL PRETTY MUCH ONLY BRING IT OUT WHEN THERE ARE OR PEOPLE
TERRIFIC THE PRICING ADDITION TO TRIED AND TRUE TILE LAYING COMBINED WITH VARIABLE SCORING GIVES IOS A TON OF ENGAGEMENT AND REPLAY
A MODERN CLASSIC

TAKES THE PLAY STYLE OF CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG AND SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKES IT SIMPLER AND DEEPER ALSO IT GENERATES SOME GREAT TABLE BANTER OUR MOST PLAYED GAME OF THIS YEAR AND A TRULY INSPIRED DESIGN
I ACTUALLY DON'T LIKE THIS ONE AND HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SURPRISED AT HOW POPULAR IT IS I FIND THE PRICING MECHANISM OF THE GAME INTRODUCES A LOT OF CHAOS STINGINESS INTO THE MIX WHICH FEELS OUT OF PLACE TO PRICE THINGS WELL YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF WHAT EVERYONE WANTS NEEDS WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS JUST FROM LOOKING AT WHAT FEATURES ARE SCORING THAT ROUND WHAT YOU NEED WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND A ROUGH SENSE OF HOW MUCH MONEY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE IN THE GAMES I'VE PLAYED THERE IS A LOT OF UNDERPAYING FOR VALUABLE TILES AND OVERPAYING FOR LESS VALUABLE ONES FURTHERMORE THIS SINGLE ELEMENT APPEARS TO HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON SCORING THAN THE PUZZLE TILE PLACEMENT

ULTIMATELY IT FEELS TOO RANDOM SWINGY FOR WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE A CONTEMPLATIVE TILE PLACER FOR ME

THE SCORING SYSTEM IS COOL THOUGH AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT USED IN OTHER GAMES
I ENJOYED IT THOUGH IT DID SEEM WAY BETTER TO NOT GIVE A CRAP ABOUT ANY OF THE EARLY GAME SCORING THINGS AND FOCUS ON THE LATE GAME SCORING TILES NOT ONLY DO YOU GET MORE TURNS TO MAKE LATE GAME SCORING WORTH MORE BUT BY BEING BEHIND IN POINTS YOU GET FREE COINS

IT WOULD TAKE A FEW GAMES TO PROPERLY ASSESS HOW VALUABLE A TILE IS FROM THE GAMES I'VE PLAYED PEOPLE HAVE UNDERSHOT AND THEY GET THEIR PRECIOUS TILES BOUGHT FROM UNDER THEM CREATING LOTS OF BITTERNESS
SO GOOD
AWESOME GAME
IT'S FAIRLY QUICK HAS SOME DEEP THOUGHT BUT RELATIVELY SIMPLE ACTIONS

WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS PLAYING WITH PEOPLE THAT FEEL THE NEED TO CALCULATE THE VALUE OF EVERY TILE FOR EVERY PLAYER IN DETAIL AT ALL STAGES OF THE GAME IT SHOULD BE A TO MINUTE AT MAX GAME WITH PLAYERS

WITH SOME PEOPLE HOWEVER THEY WANT TO CALCULATE THE VALUE OF ALL OF THEIR TILES FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR EVERY OTHER PLAYER TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW MUCH EACH PLAYER CAN AFFORD THEN THEY WANT TO TEST EACH OTHER TILE WHEN ITS THEIR TURN TO BUY TO SEE IF IT'LL FIT AND CALCULATE HOW MANY POINTS THEY'LL GET AT EACH POSITION THEY CAN PUT IT SO WHAT SHOULD BE A MAX OF ABOUT MINUTE DECISION TURNS INTO OR MINUTES AND THE GAME THAT SHOULD BE OVER IN MINUTES TAKES AN HOUR

BASICALLY DON'T PLAY WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE AP OR CAN'T MAKE DECISION BASED ON GUT INSTINCT BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S TOO SLOW FOR WHAT IT OFFERS
IT'S GREAT IF YOU ENJOY AUCTION BIDDING GAMES I WASN'T A FAN OF ALWAYS TRYING TO ARBITRARILY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE TILES ARE WORTH TO YOU OTHERS TO AVOID GETTING SHORTCHANGED OR OVERPAYING
I'VE ONLY JUST GOTTEN IT MYSELF SO I CAN'T TELL IF IT WILL STAND UP OVER TIME BUT I'M LOVING IT SO FAR JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT TO ME IN THAT THERE ARE SOME MEATY CHOICES TO MAKE EACH GAME BUT IT'S STILL FAST AND EASY TO TEACH AND LEARN ALSO I REALLY LIKE GAMES WITH VARIABLE SCORING CONDITIONS LIKE THIS ONE HAS REALLY HELPS TO AVOID FALLING INTO RUTS OF ALWAYS VALUING THE SAME TILES THE SAME WAY
IF YOU NEED SOMEONE TO TAKE IT OFF YOUR HANDS JUST LET ME KNOW
WE REALLY LIKE IT I'VE NEVER PLAYED WITH MORE THAN TWO PEOPLE OUR ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT IT IS TOO SHORT WHEN WE GET TO THE END WE ALWAYS REMARK THAT WE WISH IT WENT LONGER
AMAZING PROBABLY THE QUICKEST A GAME HAS REACHED MY TOP FROM TIME OF PURCHASE
I'D SAY I RATHER NOT SAY ANYTHING YOU GOT THE GAME AND SHOULD PLAY IT OTHERWISE YOU GET BIASED BY OPINIONS OF RANDOMS I STILL LOVE YOU FOLKS

IF YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE TO PLAY A FEW ROUNDS ALREADY LET ME TELL YOU CONGRATS AND KEEP HAVING FUN
I MAINLY GAME WITH MY SO SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT I REALLY LIKED THE GAME ESPECIALLY BC IT'S ALWAYS A DIFFERENT GAME DUE TO THE DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES I DON'T PLAY IT MUCH BUT I WOULD PLAY IT ANY TIME
YOUR NOT THE ONLY ONE SEEING NO PROGRESS I PLACED MY ORDER LATE WEDNESDAY AND STILL NOTHING
I'M HAVING MAJOR ISSUES WITH THEIR SITE AS WELL I PLACED AN ORDER OF ITEMS BUT KEPT GETTING AN ACS REJECTION THIS WAS SATURDAY SO I CALLED THE NUMBER IN THE FAQ AND LEFT A MESSAGE THEN I GOT A CALL FROM THE BANK ABOUT FRAUD PROTECTION AND TOLD THEM TO ALLOW ONE OF THE CHARGES ASMODEUS NEVER CALLED BACK HALF MY ORDER IS OUT OF STOCK STILL CAN'T GET A HOLD OF THEM HAD TO TODAY ON A DIFFERENT CARD I LOVE THESE PRICES BUT IT'S BEEN A REAL HASSLE
NOV IS MONDAY IS THAT WHAT THEY MEANT
THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAD THE SAME ISSUE BUT FIGURED WITH THE SALE THEY PROBABLY HAD A TON OF ORDERS I DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE THEIR TIME CHECKING ON THE STATUS WHEN IT'S JUST A SIMPLE DELAY I FEEL MUCH BETTER KNOWING I'M IT THE ONLY ONE WHO WORRIED ABOUT THE DELAY
MY PENDING CHARGE ALSO GOOFED BUT DID NOT PROCESS I FREAKED OUT AND EMAILED CUSTOMER SUPPORT BEFORE I FOUND THIS THREAD HERE IS THE PROMPT RESPONSE I RECEIVED

THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON THING HAPPENING WHERE THE CHARGE WILL TEMPORARILY SHOW UP FOR THE TO MAKE SURE THE FUNDS ARE THERE BUT THEN NOT BE VISIBLE AGAIN UNTIL THE ORDER SHIPS YOUR ORDER APPEARS TO BE PROCESSING AS NORMAL BUT YOU ARE WELCOME TO CHECK WITH YOUR BANK ONCE YOU GET NOTICE THAT YOUR ORDER SHIPS AND IF YOUR CHARGE DOESN T SHOW UP THEN
I WAS ABOUT TO POST THIS GOT THE SAME EMAIL
TWO SEPARATE ORDERS NONE OF WHICH HAS SHIPPED ONE IS STILL SHOWING AS PENDING INFAMY CREDIT CARD THE OTHER HAS DISAPPEARED
IM IN THE SAME THING I ORDERED THE PAST THURSDAY AND IT'S STILL PENDING
NOT YET I ACTUALLY BOUGHT SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM THE HOLIDAY SALE VIA FFA THE MARKHAM HORROR CG MARKHAM NIGHTS SCENARIO AFTER I PLACED A HOLIDAY SALE ORDER AND I'VE ALREADY RECEIVED IT
DOES THE GAME USE DICE OR CARDS PERHAPS A DICE BAG CUP OR SLEEVES TO FIT THE CARDS
IT'S KIND OF LAME TO DO THE GIFT CARD BUT IF HER WISELIEST SUCKS YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU CAN
AS A SECRET SANTA RECEIVER FROM LAST YEAR LET ME TELL YOU DONT GIFT GIFTCARDS THEY ARE A HUGE

HONESTLY GIFT CARDS SUCK

AND NOW FOR CREATIVE IDEAS IF YOU CANT FIND GAMES FROM THE WISELIEST TRY GETTING DICE DICETOWERS BOARDGAME ORGANIZERS BAGS CARD SLEEVES IF SHE IS INTO MINIATURE GAMING MAYBE EVEN A

OR MAYBE YOU CAN FIND A GAME THAT IS NOT ON THE LIST BUT SIMILAR LIKE DOMINION TO ASCENSION

HELL EVEN IF IT IS GAMING POSTERS BOOKS ETC THAT WOULD BE A BETTER GIFT THAN A GIFT CARD THOSE CARDS ARE ALWAYS A HUGE FOR THE RECEIVER AND ALMOST SPOILED THE SECRET SANTA FOR ME LAST YEAR
CURIOUS ABOUT THIS

WHAT IS THE GAME I SWEAR I'M NOT HER JUST CURIOUS
HAVE YOU INCLUDED SHIPPING ALREADY
HOW ABOUT A CHEAP FILLER I WOULD RATHER TAKE THAT THAN A GIFT CARD ANY DAY ONE OF THE JOYS OF SECRET SANTA IS PICKING OUT A GIFT FOR SOMEONE WITH A GIFT CARD YOU ARE TELLING THEM TO PICK FOR THEMSELVES AT THAT POINT WHY NOT JUST HAVE EVERYONE TAKE BUY THEMSELVES A GAME

HAVE YOU TRIED REACHING OUT TO YOUR TARGET TO SEE IF SHE CAN ADD SOME CHEAP STUFF TO THE LIST IF YOUR TARGET IS THE TYPE THAT SAYS THAT THEIR LIST IS THE ONLY THING THAT THEY WANT AND WILL ACCEPT THEN YEAH SEND THE GIFT CARD EVEN BETTER GET A GIFT CARD FOR AND ONLY SEND THAT
SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS BUT PRETTY CLOSE AND IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE FUN STYLE GAME

JAMAICA WOULD ALSO BE A PRETTY GOOD OPTION IT IS ROLL AND MOVE AND REALLY EASY TO PLAY
IF YOU ARE STUCK WITH GOING TO TARGET TO GRAB GAMES THEN YOUR ONLY REAL OPTIONS ARE CATAN KING OF TOKYO OR CODENAMES I PERSONALLY WOULD SUGGEST CODENAMES SINCE IT WORKS IN ALMOST ANY SCENARIO BUT IT'S NOT A ROLLING GAME AT ALL BUT IF YOU NEED A DICE GAME I WOULD GO WITH KING OF TOKYO FOR IT'S THEME AND RECOGNIZABLE YAHTZEE MECHANICS OVER CATAN WHICH IS STILL A SOLID GREAT GATEWAY GAME TO GRAB
ARE TARGET AND TOYS R US YOUR ONLY OPTIONS I KNOW OURS NORMALLY AREN'T WELL STOCKED BEST THING THEY HAVE I CAN THINK OF THAT KINDA MATCHES WHAT YOU WANT IS KING OF TOKYO
TALISMAN OR RELIC
YOU COULD LOOK INTO TICKET TO RIDE AS WELL IT IS NOT A ROLL AND MOVE BUT VERY EASY TO PICK UP


EDIT AND BOTH STORES ARE LIKELY TO CARRY IT
YOU NEED A GATEWAY GAME
DEFINITELY TRY CARCASSONNE
YOU SEEM TO HAVE MISSED YOUR CALLING IN R BOARDGAMESCIRCLEJERK
RACIAL TECHS THAT ARE REALLY STRONG

BARONY'S NON-EUCLIDEAN SHIELDING IS BONKERS WITH URANIUM ARMOR
MIRROR COMPUTING COMBINED WITH TRANSFABRICATION IS A REALLY POWERFUL ENGINE
MAEON IMPLANTS LETTING THE BEST RACE IN THE GAME STEAL THE BEST ACTION CARDS IS ALMOST OVERKILL

OUTSIDE OF THESE I DON'T THINK ANY ARE TOO GOOD AND THOSE ABOVE AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO NOT USE A FUN FEATURE THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SOME OF THE WEAKER RACES PLAYABLE

FLAGSHIPS ARE VERY SLOW AND EXPENSIVE I THINK ONLY THE WOULD CAUSE ANY FEEL BAD MOMENTS A NEW PLAYER MIGHT NOT LIKE LOSING THEIR GIANT FLEET IN ONE FELL SWOOP

I THINK RACIAL TECHS AND FLAGSHIPS ADD MORE TO MAKE EACH RACE FEEL UNIQUE AND EXCITING I WOULD WANT TO PLAY WITH THEM EVERY GAME

THE GAME RACES AT THIS POINT BALANCE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION THE QUESTION SHOULD BE ARE THE INTERACTIONS INTERESTING THE ANSWER IS YES AND THERE IS NO OVERPOWERED COMBINATION

THE FLAGSHIPS AND RACIAL TECHS WERE LARGELY USED TO BOOST THE POWER OF THE WEAKER RACES THE REALLY GOOD RACES GOT WEAKER RACIAL TECHS AND FLAGSHIPS
I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO HEAD OVER TO R TWILIGHTIMPERIUM OR BETTER YET THIS THREAD IN PARTICULAR AN OPTIMAL FIRST GAME OF TI

MY HAS BEEN ARCADIA QUEST I'M A HUGE SUCKER FOR THESE KINDS OF GAMES AND SINCE I HAVE DUNGEONS OF MASMORRA COMING SOON I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE PIECES INTERCHANGEABLY

BUT THAT PRICE TAG IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY CAN'T BE AVOIDED TOO WELL ESPECIALLY WITH A MOVE SO CLOSE BEHIND ME AND WITH CHRISTMAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER I DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO GRAB THAT ONE FOR A LOOOOOOOONG TIME


OFF THE BEATEN PATH OF WHAT MOST OF YOU WOULD CALL A SALE BUT THE UPCOMING BATTLEFORCE BOXES FOR WARHAMMER AGE OF SIGMA ARE GOING TO BE NICE I'VE BEEN WANTING TO EXPAND A COUPLE OF MY ARMIES AND THE PRICE POINT ON THOSE BOXES IS GOING TO SERIOUSLY HELP DIMINISH WHAT WAS OTHERWISE GOING TO BE PURE WALLET TERROR
VITICULTURE BLACK ORCHESTRA GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL AND ARBORETUM

HONESTLY KIDS GAMES

AS A THERAPIST I USE THEM EVERY DAY WITH KIDS FROM TODDLERS TO CHILDREN I CAN'T GET ANYTHING TOO COMPLEX BECAUSE THE KIDS I WORK WITH HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFICULTIES BUT I DON'T MIND SIMPLIFYING THEM AND CHANGING THE RULES

DECO JANOK MELISSA AND DOUG SUPERDUPER SMART GAMES FOREMIND MAKE AWESOME GAMES I AM HOPING ONE DAY TO HAVE A GREAT COLLECTION
CURRENTLY LOOKING AT
ELDRITCH HORROR FORSAKEN LORE STRANGE REMNANTS
FABLED FRUIT
DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG
CONCORDIA SALSA
BACK IN STOCK I DIDN'T THINK THE SCYTHE EXPANSION HIT YET I PUT IN MY MINIATURE MARKET PREORDER AGES AGO
I DON'T BUY GAMES FOR MYSELF A MONTH OUT FROM CHRISTMAS
I THINK THEY'RE A LOT OF FUN I OWN LEGEND OF DRIZZLE AND I HAVE BUDDIES WHO OWN WRATH OF ASHARDALON AND CASTLE RAVENLOFT IT'S NEAT THAT THEY'RE MORE OR LESS COMPATIBLE SO IF I WANT TO BRING MY DRIZZLE CHARACTER INTO AN ASHARDALON GAME I CAN DO THAT I WOULD SAY ASHARDALON IS THE EASIEST AND RAVENLOFT IS THE HARDEST BUT OVERALL YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND ALL OF THEM CHALLENGING I HAVE NOT PLAYED THE NEWEST ONE TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL
YES I FOUND THE D D BOARDGAMES TO BE VERY DECENT BEER PRETZELS AFFAIRS THAT YOU COULD SET UP AND RUN IN AN HOUR OR SO EVERYONE GETS TO ROLL A AND DO SOME HACK AND SLASH AND IT ALL PACKS UP QUICKLY AFTER THE FACT MY PERSONAL FAVORITE OUT OF ALL OF THEM WAS WRATH OF ASHARDALON BUT THAT MAY HAVE JUST BEEN BECAUSE OF THE COOL RED DRAGON MINI THE BARONG SORRY BALOR MINIATURE IN LEGEND OF DRIZZLE WAS NICE TOO BUT I DIDN'T ENJOY THE ACTUAL GAME AS MUCH

EDIT IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT NO ONE HAS TO BE DM FOR THOSE GAMES IT'S ALL HANDLED BY RANDOM TILE DRAWS AND A DUNGEON DECK
I THINK THEY'RE A LOT OF FUN AND CAN SATISFY THAT D D ITCH THAT SAID RAVENLOFT IS A BITCH I FEEL THAT THE CARDS ARE STACKED AGAINST YOU HIGHER THAN THE OTHERS
WHY NOT JUST ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE FANTASY ARCHETYPES ACQUIRE LOOT KILL ZOMBIES
I WOULD SAY THEY FIT YOUR CRITERIA I OWN ALL THREE AND ALSO USE THEM AS A BREAK FROM DEMING MY GROUP LIKES THEM THOUGH ONE PLAYER ALWAYS COMPLAINS ABOUT HOW RIDICULOUSLY HARD RAVENLOFT IN PARTICULAR IS
YOUR APPROACH SOUNDS GOOD AND THERE ARE A BUNCH OF WAYS TO DO IT I WILL RECOMMEND NOT PAINTING THE INSIDES OF THE TEETH THOUGH MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO TURN THE GEARS LATER I HAD DONE IT THEN NEEDED TO SAND THEM OFF TO LET THEM MOVE TEDIOUS
HERE IS HOW I DID MINE I USED THE SIMPLEST METHOD POSSIBLE BUT HONESTLY I LIKE MINE MORE THAN ANY I'VE SEEN THEY LOOK REALLY GREAT ON THE TABLE

NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO REMEMBER IT'S SUPER EASY TO START OVER SOAK THEM IN SIMPLE GREEN AND SCRUB THEM OFF WITH AN OLD TOOTHBRUSH AND GIVE IT ANOTHER GO
I'M NOT A PAINTER AT ALL SO I TOOK ADVICE ON BG PRIMED EVERYTHING BLACK AND THEN BASICALLY DREW ON THE COLOR WITH THESE PAINT PENS THE ONE I USED I THINK WAS EITHER A EIGHT OR TEN PACK BUT THEY WORKED BRILLIANTLY AND APART FROM BEING TIME CONSUMING I ENDED UP WITH SOMETHING PRETTY NICE THE RAISED LINES ON THE GEAR KEEPS THE SURFACE TENSION OF THE PAINT FROM SPILLING OFF IN MOST CASES AND IT REALLY JUST BECOMES AN EXERCISE IN TRACING LINES WITH A STEADY HAND

I'M AWAY FROM HOME FOR THE WEEK SO I CAN'T SNAP YOU A PICTURE BUT IF YOU'RE CURIOUS I CAN SEND YOU ONE NEXT WEEK SO YOU CAN SEE HOW IT CAME OUT
I'M NO MASTER PAINTER BUT I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF COLOR SCHEME YOU WANT TO USE FOR YOUR TZOLKIN GEARS I PERSONALLY WANTED THE CENTER GEAR BLACK SO I HAD SPRAY PRIMED IT BLACK I DIDN'T NEED TO USE A WASH OR ANYTHING AND THEN I JUST TOOK A SMALL BRUSH WITH THE INDIVIDUAL COLORS AND VERY CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY TRACED THE LINES DESIGNS THAT I WANTED AFTER THAT I SPRAYED ON A SEALANT IN MATTE OVERALL I'M HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS

PAINTED GEARS
I HAD MAINLY FOLLOWED THE DESIGN OF SOMEONE ELSE ON BG AND MADE SOME OF MY OWN ADDITIONS ON IT
YOUR PLAN SOUNDS GOOD AND TO DO BETTER ONE THING I WOULD RECOMMEND DOING IS TO NOT SPRAY PRIMER COATS YOU REALLY ONLY NEED THE PRIMER JUST MAKES IT SO THE PAINT STAYS ON THE PLASTIC BETTER USING MORE WON'T MAKE IT STICK ANY BETTER AS THE TZOLKIN GEARS DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH DETAIL IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL HOWEVER IF YOU EVER GET INTO PAINTING MINIS TOO MUCH PRIMER MAY COVER UP SOME FOLDS OR THE FINER DETAILS

THE WASH SHADE INK IS A NICE BUT NOT NECESSARY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THE GEARS BUT ITS A NICE TOUCH THAT MAKES YOUR MINIS BRING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL I RECOMMEND CITADEL'S NUL OIL FOR ALL PURPOSE SHADE ITS ABOUT YOU CAN BASICALLY SHADE AT ANY STEP BEFORE THE CLEAR MATTE SPRAY SEALER HOWEVER I LIKE TO SHADE BEFORE I DRY BRUSH AS I LIKE MY MINIS A BIT BRIGHTER BUT YOU CAN ALSO SHADE AFTER YOUR DRY BRUSH TO HAVE AN OVERALL DARKER TONE TO IT
BETWEEN THE BASE COAT AND THE DRY BRUSH I'D USE A WASH IT GIVES IT MORE DEPTH YOU CAN ALSO DRY BRUSH WITH TWO DIFFERENT SIMILAR COLORS WICH ALSO HELPS WITH MAKING THE COLOR LESS FLAT THE LAST SUGGESTION IS DEFINITELY NOT NECESSARY THOUGH
SPLENDOR COULD BE GOOD THE ONLY TEXT ON A CARD IS ITS COST
HOW ABOUT HANAFI
CODENAMES PICTURES
GALAXY TRUCKER MIGHT BE A GOOD OPTION MOST OF THE COMMUNICATION THE GAME DOES WITH YOU IS THROUGH PICTURES AND NUMBERS
CODENAMES PICTURES IS A A LOT OF FUN ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE THERE ISN'T MUCH DEPTH AS FAR AS STRATEGY GOES BUT IT DOES MAKE YOU THINK

DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST MYSTERIUM IT ALSO HAS ALMOST NO READING FOR THE PLAYERS CHANNELING THE SPIRIT
TRURO LANTERNS AND SPLENDOR ARE ALL GREAT GAMES WITH NO READING
HOW FAMILIAR ARE THEY WITH GAMES SOMETHING LIKE WONDERS COULD WORK SINCE IT'S ALL SYMBOLS BUT ITS RULES ARE HEAVIER THAN DIXIT
QWIRKLE IS GOOD FOR ALL AGES THOUGH MIGHT BE HARD FOR ANYONE WHO'S COLORBLIND
INGENIOUS IS ANOTHER GREAT ABSTRACT SAME CAVEAT
INDIGO HAS GONE OVER WELL WITH FAMILY FOR ME
CARCASSONNE HAS NO READING AFTER THE INITIAL RULES EXPLANATION

EDIT LANTERNS IS IN THE SAME VEIN BUT HAS DIFFERENT GRAPHICS FOR THE COLORED TILES SO IT'S EASIER TO DISTINGUISH
SPYFAULT

GREAT GAME WHERE EVERYONE IS WORKING TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS THE SPY IN A GROUP OF PEOPLE

CELESTIA

PUSH YOUR LUCK GAME WHERE PLAYERS ARE TRYING TO GET THE MOST AMOUNT OF POINTS POSSIBLE RELIES QUITE A LOT ON COLORS THOUGH

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM

A BLUFFING GAME WHERE PLAYERS ARE TRYING TO GET THE MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY BY THE END OF THE GAME THROUGH THE GOODS THEY TRY TO GET INTO NOTTINGHAM THERE IS A GOOD BIT OF TEXT ON CARDS BUT THIS IS EASILY SUPPLEMENTED BY THE PICTURES AND COLOR OF THE CARDS THAT GIVE ENOUGH INFORMATION
MANY ABSTRACT GAMES WILL FIT THE BILL HERE ARE SOME ABSTRACTS FROM MY COLLECTION ALL OF THESE GAMES HAVE NO TEXT ON ANY OF THE PIECES

HIVE
BLOCKUS
QUARTO
QUITS
QUORIDOR
QWIRKLE

TAKENOKO HAS CARDS BUT THEY'RE SYMBOLS
CONCEPT WOULD WORK IF YOU ARE OKAY WITH CHOOSING YOUR OWN PHRASES AND WORDS TO CONVEY INSTEAD OF RELYING ON THE ENGLISH CARDS
THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IT'S A QUICK AND EASY GAME WE OFTEN PLAY WITH GUESTS I WOULDN'T SAID IT HAS A LOT OF STRATEGY IN IT BUT NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT IT CERTAINLY HAS MORE THAN DIXIT OR MYSTERIUM

HANAFI IS ANOTHER GREAT ONE THAT SOMEONE'S ALREADY MENTIONED NOT FOND OF THE WEIRD SCORING SYSTEM THOUGH

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING REALLY INTENSE RESISTANCE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TEXT THAT I CAN REMEMBER MOSTLY SYMBOLS
CARD GAMES BIBLIOG JAIPUR PORT ROYAL
DISCOVERIES
FIVE TRIBES
SHAKESPEARE
TRAJAN ITS A LITTLE BIT HEAVIER MAYBE

TRURO DOESN'T INVOLVE ANY TEXT IT'S SIMPLE TO LEARN BUT IT STILL HAS SOME STRATEGY
SUSHI GO HAS A VERY LIMITED VOCABULARY AND IS MOSTLY NUMERIC SABOTEUR AND SET DON'T REQUIRE TEXT IF YOUR PARENTS ARE TOTALLY COMFORTABLE SPEAKING LISTENING AND BLUFFING IN ENGLISH THEN SOMETHING LIKE RESISTANCE OR WEREWOLF WOULD BE FINE I'VE ACTUALLY PLAYED VARIANTS ON REGULAR CODENAMES WITH MY ADULT ELL STUDENTS EITHER WE USE A SUBSET OF THE DECK AND TALK ABOUT THE WORDS BEFOREHAND OR WE PLAY A COOPERATIVE VERSION THAT DOESN'T USE THE SPY BYSTANDER ASSASSIN MECHANIC ONE VERSION IS TO TAKE TURNS GIVING A CLUE FOR THREE WORDS ANY THREE WORDS AND THE FIRST PERSON TO CORRECTLY GUESS THE WORDS WINS THE HAND SORT OF LIKE ONE VARIANT OF SET THE OTHER VERSION WHICH THEY PREFERRED WAS TO COME UP WITH A SENTENCE OR STORY USING THEIR THREE CARDS THE SECOND PROBABLY ISN'T UP YOUR ALLEY BUT THE FIRST MIGHT BE

BOARDGAMEGEEK HAS A LANGUAGE DEPENDENCY METADATA FIELD ANYONE KNOW HOW TO FILTER BY THAT


TRURO
CANDY LAND JUST GOTTA TELL COLORS APART
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR TARGET PRICE IS BUT HAS IT FOR


CHECK OUT THIS GEEKIEST FOR PLENTY OF REALLY GOOD SUGGESTIONS
ARCADIA QUEST IS A FUN PLAYER GAME FIGHTING INVADING MONSTERS AND EACH OTHER PLAYERS COMPETE TO BE THE TOP GUILD AFTER SCENARIOS EACH SCENARIO HAS ITS OWN OBJECTIVES BOSSES AND REWARDS BETWEEN SCENARIOS USE MONEY COLLECTED TO BUY UPGRADES FOR YOUR GUILD MEMBERS
IF YOUR GROUP IS OK WITH A LITTLE FRIENDLY COMPETITION THIS IS FUN GAME TO PLAY

MACHS VS MINIONS IS A COOP GAME PLAYERS CONTROL UP TO MACHS AND TRY TO FULFIL OBJECTIVES FOR THE MISSIONS THERE ARE MISSIONS IN THE GAME TO CONTROL THE MECH YOU DRAFT A COMMAND CARD THEN PUT THEM IN YOUR PROGRAMMING BOARD THEN EXECUTE THE PROGRAM SIMPLE YET FUN
I'VE NOTICED YOU DON'T HAVE ANY COOPERATIVE GAMES IN YOUR COLLECTION SO I'LL SUGGEST A COUPLE

ELDRITCH HORROR IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE GAME IT'S A LENGTHY MEATY BUT MECHANICALLY UNCOMPLICATED RACE AGAINST THE INSIDIOUS BEINGS FORCES YOU CHOOSE TO OPPOSE WHEN YOU SET UP THE GAME WILL MAKE YOU A FAN OF HOVERCRAFT IF YOU AREN'T ALREADY

PANDEMIC IS NOT AS GREAT IN MY OPINION AS MANY PEOPLE SAY BUT IT'S RELENTLESS POPULARITY AND TIGHTNESS IN DESIGN CAN'T BE IGNORED PLAYERS ARE DOCTORS AND EXPERTS ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT WORLDWIDE OUTBREAKS VERY PUZZLE IN NATURE AND LOTS OF VARIATION IN PLAYS AND POSSIBILITIES

FORBIDDEN DESERT ANOTHER LEACOCK GAME LIKE PANDEMIC AND FOLLOWS A SIMILAR STRUCTURE I LIKE IT A LOT MORE THOUGH BECAUSE THE THEME OF CRASHING IN A DESERT AND BUILDING A FLYING MACHINE FROM DUG UP RELICS IS PRETTY COOL IT'S SHORTER AND THE COMPONENT QUALITY IS GREAT LESS DRY PUZZLE AND MORE ADVENTURE THAN PANDEMIC

YOU ALSO DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY MED HEAVY EUROS

PUERTO RICO IS LIKE PANDEMIC A GAME THAT HAS RECEIVED TONS OF AWARDS AND IN MY OPINION I THINK IT IS MUCH MORE DESERVING PLAYERS OWN A PLANTATION OUTSIDE SAN JOSE THAT THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO DEVELOP AND SHIP GOODS FROM BUT WHAT IT BECOMES IS A TACTICAL PLAY-BY-PLAY OF MANIPULATING THE COOL ROLE SELECTION MECHANIC TO GET THE MOST OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S TURNS ENDLESS FUN

PRINCES OF FLORENCE IS OVERSHADOWED YOUNGER BROTHER AND IS BASICALLY AN AUCTION GAME MIXED WITH A PERSONAL TERRIS WHERE YOU BUILD A VILLA OUT OF PURCHASED TILES THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF PLAYER INTERACTION AND HEAVINESS FOR A EURO WITHOUT GOING OVERBOARD THE MEAT OF THE GAME IS BEING A FINE PATRON FOR ARTISTS AND SCIENTISTS AND SCHOLARS AND IT'S ODDLY SATISFYING WHEN YOUR MANOR HELP THEM CREATE A HUGELY SCORING MASTERWORK

KEYFLOWER IS ONE OF THE GOLDEN CHILDREN HERE ON THIS SUBREDDIT AND IT'S BASICALLY POF WITH A MORE COMPLICATED AUCTION AND TILE SYSTEM AND WHERE SCORING HAPPENS IN A SPECIAL WAY AT THE END OF THE FINAL SEASON WINTER AS OPPOSED TO ON YOUR OWN TERMS YOU WILL BE VERY CONFUSED THE FIRST FEW TIMES YOU PLAY BUT ONCE STRATEGIES START TO APPEAR YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE EVERY MOMENT

FINALLY I'LL JUST QUICKLY MENTION A FEW GAMES SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HAVE THAT I IMAGINE WOULD GO OVER WELL

COSMIC ENCOUNTER

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY

BLOOD RAGE

LOVE LETTER

ABYSS

LORDS OF WATERDEEP


HAPPY GAMING
FORBIDDEN ISLAND IS A LESS INTENSE VERSION OF FORBIDDEN DESERT I LOVE FORBIDDEN DESERT
CASTLE PANIC IS CO OP AND LIGHT

HANAFI BURGLED BROS IS ANOTHER GREAT ONE
FLASH POINT FIRE RESCUE

IT'S A LITTLE LIGHTER THAN PANDEMIC
WORK AS A TEAM TO RESCUE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES CATS FROM A BURNING BUILDING WHILE COMBATING FIRE SMOKE AND DEALING WITH HARMAT GET EVERYONE OUT OF THE BUILDING BEFORE IT COLLAPSES TO WIN THE GAME
THE BIG BOOK OF MADNESS IS A PRETTY FUN AND LIGHTWEIGHT CO-OP GAME THE THEME IS A BIT LIGHTER THAN THE ACTUAL GAMEPLAY BUT IT'S A FUN GAME NONETHELESS
PANDEMIC THE CURE MIGHT BE A GOOD OPTION THEN IF SHE LIKED PANDEMIC BUT FELT IT A BIT MUCH IT SIMPLIFIES THE GAME BOARD AND USES DICE IT'S MORE LUCK BASED BUT OVERALL EASIER
HANAFI CAN BE QUITE FUN 2 PLAYER FOR A FEW SESSIONS
CASTLE PANIC TINY EPIC DEFENDERS FORBIDDEN ISLAND AND OR FORBIDDEN DESERT
SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE

SOMEWHAT THICK WHEN IT COMES TO BUT IT'S REALLY EASY TO PLAY IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SHERLOCK HOLMES
BURGLE BROS
BEYOND BAKER STREET THAT'S BEEN A HUGE SUCCESS WITH MY WIFE
RED NOVEMBER IS A VERY LIGHT CO-OP
THE GAME IS REALLY GOOD

ON AMAZON

THE DECK CONTAINS ONE OF EACH CARD FROM 2 TO PLAYERS CANNOT REVEAL WHAT CARDS THEY HOLD BUT MUST PLAY AT LEAST TWO CARDS FROM THEIR HAND ON ONE OF COLUMNS TWO COLUMNS GO DOWN TWO GO UP HOWEVER IF YOU HOLD A CARD EXACTLY DIFFERENCE FROM A VALUE YOU CAN BACK IT UP AT THE END OF YOUR TURN YOU DRAW CARDS FOR EACH CARD YOU PLAYED GOAL IS FOR PLAYERS TO PLAY ALL CARDS THOUGH YOU CANNOT SAY EXACTLY WHAT CARDS YOU HAVE YOU CAN HELP DIRECT PLAY BY CALLING COLUMNS OR SAYING HOW HARD YOU'RE GOING TO MOVE A VALUE
ONE THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN MENTIONED IS SAMURAI SPIRIT IT'S DESIGNED BY ANTOINE BAUZA WHO ALSO DESIGNED GHOST STORIES BUT I HAVEN'T PLAYED GHOST STORIES SO I CAN'T COMPARE THEM

IT TAKES ANYWHERE FROM LIKE MINUTES LIKE MOST CO-OP GAMES IT CAN BE SUPER EASY OR BRUTALLY DIFFICULT DEPENDING ON THE LUCK OF THE DRAW
HARRY POTTER HOGWARTS BATTLE ITS A FUN COOP DECK BUILDER MUCH BETTER IF YOU ACTUALLY ENJOY HP

YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER GAMES THAT ARE BASICALLY COOPERATIVE BUT WITH ONE PERSON SEPARATED FROM THE REST SO MYSTERIUM DIXIT AND NOT ALONE I JUST THREW NOT ALONE IN THERE BECAUSE I LACKED A THIRD EXAMPLE AND WANTED ONE BUT IT'S STILL A LIGHT GAME THAT'S MOSTLY COOPERATIVE

AND OF COURSE SINCE YOU MENTIONED PANDEMIC YOU SHOULD ALSO LOOK AT PANDEMIC THE CURE
EVERY STORE THAT SELLS BOARD GAMES WILL HAVE BLACK FRIDAY SALES
I THINK BARNES AND NOBLE IS DOING BUY GET HALF OFFICIAL ONLY ONE I KNOW OF SO FAR
TARGET IS DOING OFF IN STORE BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S SELECT TITLES ONLY
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT QWIRKLE
I REMEMBER PREFERRING QWIXX TO QUINTO BUT IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE PLAYED AND THEY'RE SO SIMILAR I CAN'T REALLY GIVE ANY DETAILS AS TO WHY

THE DELUXE VERSION OF QWIXX AVAILABLE AT TARGET IS NICE BECAUSE OF THE DRY ERASE STUFF BUT THEN IT DOESN'T TRAVEL AS WELL BECAUSE THE BOX IS BIGGER

IF YOU'RE SET ON ONE OF THE TWO I'D VOTE QWIXX OTHERWISE I'D SUGGEST YOU TO EXPLORE THE OTHER OPTIONS FOR SHORT FILLERS AS I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR EITHER OF THEM
I'M LOOKING FOR A GAME BEGINNING WITH OWI BUT CAN'T MAKE UP MY MIND WHICH ONE

O
LEGENDS OF ANDOR IS A GREAT PUZZLE CO-OP DISGUISED AS A RPG ADVENTURE GAME
HANAFI IS A PUZZLE CARD GAME
I WOULD SECOND LEGENDS OF ANDOR AND TRAGEDY LOOPER I WOULD ALSO POINT TO BEYOND BAKER STREET SINCE IT IS VERY SIMILAR BUT IS SAID TO WORK BETTER WITH 2 THAN HANAFI AND ON TOP OF THAT IT HAS THEME
CHECK OUT WITNESS MAYBE NOT AS INVESTIGATIVE AS SHERLOCK HOLMES PLAYS ONLY WITH EXACTLY BUT EVERY SCENARIO IN THERE IS A PUZZLE SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN HAS AN AMAZING VIDEO REVIEW OF THAT ONE
I GOT A VERY STRONG PUZZLE FEEL FROM MANSIONS OF MADNESS I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE SECOND EDITION THAT JUST CAME OUT BUT THE FIRST EDITION HAD LITTLE PHYSICAL PUZZLES YOU HAD TO SOLVE LIKE REWIRING THE LIGHTS IN A ROOM BEFORE YOU CAN LEAVE
YOU COULD TRY FREEDOM THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD

IT'S GOT MECHANICS THAT GIVES IT CHINKY GAMEPLAY
THERE'S ALSO TRAGEDY LOOPER BUT IT'S ONE VS IT'S EXTREMELY AND IS BASICALLY A DEDUCTION GAME
ESCAPE ROOM THE GAME PERHAPS I HAVEN'T TRIED IT YET BUT IT LOOKS INTERESTING
BURGLE BROS VARIABLE SETUP AND GUARD MOVEMENT MECHANIC MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A HUGE PUZZLE TO ME EVERYONE HAS TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE WITH THEIR LIMITED ACTION POINTS AND USING THEIR SPECIAL POWER IN ORDER TO WIN
WORLD'S FAIR THE BALANCE BETWEEN AREA CONTROL SET COLLECTING AND ALMOST A PICK UP AND DELIVER MECHANICS PACK A REALLY GREAT DEPTH INTO AN INCREDIBLY STREAMLINED AND FAST PLAYING GAME WHERE EVERY MOVE FEELS LIKE IT HAS MEANINGFUL CONSEQUENCES
SOMETHING I PICKED UP IN ESSEN IS BRAIN STORM I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MENTION OF IT ON HERE SO I GUESS IT COUNTS AS LITTLE KNOWN

YOU LAY OUT CARDS WITH PICTURES ON THEM IN A GRID AND YOUR GOAL IS TO COMBINE TWO OF THEM A PICTURE OF A BABY AND A CALENDAR CAN BE COMBINED TO BIRTHDAY BUT YOU CAN ALSO USE ATTRIBUTES USING A BLACK CAT WITH THE CALENDAR CAN GIVE YOU BLACK FRIDAY AND SO ON I LIKE IT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE CREATIVE IT PLAYS WITH MANY PLAYERS REALLY THE LIMIT IS WHO CAN SEE AND REACH THE TABLE IT IS FAST AND IT DOES HAVE THOSE WHEN SOMEONE COMES UP WITH A CLEVER COMBINATION
NOT SEEN MUCH ABOUT DALE OF MERCHANTS WELL WORTH YOUR TIME
CRAB STACK WAS QUITE GOOD FOR QUICK ABSTRACTS THAT PLAY REMINDED ME OF DONN BUT IN A QUICKER PACKAGE IT WAS FUN I LIKE THAT TIME FRAME AND COLORFUL ABSTRACTS ARE JUST FUN FOR ME

I THINK DESPITE A SUCCESSFUL KICKSTARTER HARBOUR FLEW UNDER THE RADAR I RECENTLY GOT TO PLAY IT AFTER WATCHING BUT NOT BACKING THE KICKSTARTER AND IT'S GREAT IT'S A REALLY SMOOTH PLAYING GAME THAT IS IN A SMALL BOX BUT ISN'T A SHALLOW GAME THE SIZE ISN'T A SELLING POINT FOR ME BUT IT MATTERS TO SOME

VIKINGS ON BOARD SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT FALL UNDER THE RADAR BUT I REALLY ENJOY IT IT'S PROBABLY OVERPRODUCED BUT WHATEVER THERE ARE FAR WORSE THINGS TO BE ACCUSED OF ULTIMATELY IT'S A VERY FUN VERY MEAN GAME IN MINUTES BEST WITH FOUR THOUGH OK WITH THREE HAVEN'T PLAYED WITH TWO BUT DON'T FEEL LIKE I NEED TO
COUNCIL OF BLACKTHORN FULL DISCLOSURE I HELPED RUN THE KS FOR THIS GAME BUT THE GAME HAS BEEN GETTING SOLID RATINGS FROM USERS ON BG AND IT'S A GAME THAT I'VE PLAYED A TIMES THIS YEAR BUT STILL ENJOY I ALSO SEE THAT MINIATURE MARKET HAS IT ON SALE FOR ONLY WHICH YOU CAN'T BEAT
JAIPUR
2 PANDEMIC
CUBE QUEST
SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE
PATCHWORK

MY FIANCE AND I REALLY LIKE HANAFI GREAT GAME FOR IMPROVING COMMUNICATION TOO
WONDERS DUEL AND AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES BIG AND SMALL ARE TWO GAMES I WOULD RECOMMEND TO A GAMING COUPLE TOO
GREAT LIST JAIPUR DIDN'T REALLY DO IT FOR ME BUT PATCHWORK SHERLOCK AND PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN FAVORITES FOR ME AND MY WIFE I HAVEN'T PLAYED CUBE QUEST YET BUT I OWN IT AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
MY WIFE AND I LIKE TO TAKE HIVE WITH US WHEN ARE GOING OUT TO A BAR OR RESTAURANT SOMETIMES WE'VE PLAYED ABOUT GAMES OF IT AND SHE HAS YET TO BEAT ME SO NOW SHE JUST BRINGS JAIPUR
ONE OF OUR FAVORITES IS THE GAME MORELS
I'LL THROW STAR REALMS INTO THE RING AS WELL
I'LL THROW LOST CITIES THE CARD GAME NOT THE BOARD GAME INTO THE MIX HERE MY WIFE AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT AND IT'S SUPER PORTABLE AND EASY TO PLAY MY MOTHER-IN-LAW LIKES IT BECAUSE SHE CAN WIN TOO
SPLENDOR ANY DAY ANY TIME IS JUST THAT GOOD
THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS INTO A SHORT VIDEO AND NOT A MINUTE SLOG
TO ADD TO THAT LIST I'D SUGGEST TAKING A LOOK AT HOUNDED BY ATLAS GAMES

I'M BIASED SINCE I'M ITS DESIGNER BUT I DEVELOPED AND PLAYTESTED IT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT TURNED OUT AS A FUN COUPLES COMPETITIVE STRATEGY GAME ATLAS GAMES AND I RECENTLY DID AN AMA YOU CAN CHECK OUT GASEOSITY ALSO REVIEWED IT RECENTLY AND HAD A SIMILAR FEELING
MY A COSTUME DESIGNER BY TRADE SO SHE'LL EITHER LOVE OR HATE ME FOR BRINGING PATCHWORK INTO OUR LIFE THANKS FOR THE RECOMMEND
SHOPPING LIST FOR DONE

THE ONLY THING I'M WORRIED ABOUT AT THIS POINT IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WIFE AND I BOTH BUY EACH OTHER THE SAME GAMES
THESE ARE OKAY BUT NONE OF THEM ARE RHINO HERO WORKING AT A BOARD GAME CAFE THAT GAME WOULD BE A HIT WITH COUPLES OF THE TIME MAYBE IT'S A BETTER DATE GAME
MY SO AND I BEEN PLAYING THE BIG BOOK OF MADNESS NONE STOP GREAT GAME
MY WIFE WHO DOES NOT LIKE COMPLICATED BOARD GAMES AND WASN'T THAT INTERESTED IN PANDEMIC LOVES VITICULTURE IT'S PLAYERS AND HAS A FUN WINE MAKING THEME WE ALWAYS POUR A GLASS WHEN WE SIT DOWN AND PLAY
JAIPUR HAS GREAT STRATEGIES AND BLUFFING TECHNIQUES

I LOVE THE CO-OP ASPECT OF SHERLOCK

MY SO AND I LOVE AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES BIG AND SMALL

WE ALSO LOVE HIVE FOR A QUICK STRATEGIC GAME

HOW DOES PATCHWORK COMPARE TO THESE GAMES HOW DEEP IS IT HOW IS THE REPLACEABILITY
MY WIFE LOVES CASTLES OF BURGUNDY PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE WINS MORE THAN NOT
I REALLY CANNOT RECOMMEND MARGI ENOUGH IT HAS A UNIQUE MECHANIC AND IS ROBUST AND DEEP BUT NOT OVERLY COMPLEX IT'S WELL DONE AND INTERESTING AND AS AN ADDED BONUS THE LORE INCLUDES THE FACT THAT THE WOMEN ARE THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES SO WIVES TEND TO LIKE THAT FOR SOME REASON
A COUPLE OF OTHER GAMES MY GIRLFRIEND AND I PLAY QUITE OFTEN THAT WE ENJOY
RIVALS FOR CATAN
MANCALA
CRIBBAGE


OR YOU COULD PUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP IN JEOPARDY EVERY TIME BY PLAYING TWILIGHT STRUGGLE
THIS WAS THE PERFECT DAY TO JOIN THIS SUBREDDIT SO AND I ARE MOVING INTO OUR TINY HOUSE THIS YEAR AND ARE LOOKING FOR MORE TWO PLAYER GAMES THANKS REDDIN
I ALSO NOMINATE CONTROLLED CHAOS WITH PLAYERS BUT WITH TWO YOU CAN GET REALLY MANIPULATIVE

THE GIST SUPER RHINO OH THAT ALMOST MADE THE LAST WE DID A VIDEO ON IT HERE
HOUNDED REVIEW TO ADD TO THAT LIST I'D SUGGEST TAKING A LOOK AT HOUNDED BY ATLAS GAMES I'M BIASED SINCE I'M ITS DESIGNER BUT I DEVELOPED AND PLAYTESTED IT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT TURNED OUT AS A FUN COUPLES COMPETITIVE STRATEGY GAME ATP
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
MARKHAM HORROR CG WOULD FIT THE BILL FOR ME IF THEY HAD AN ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IN THE BOX IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE PAYING FOR A TEASER
I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF GOOD COUPLE GAMES BUT AND THEN WE HELD HANDS IS MY FIANCE AND I'S FAVORITE COUPLE GAME TO PLAY TOGETHER
IF YOU LIKED THIS VIDEO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ACTUALOL HE HAS A BOARD GAMES FOR COUPLES VIDEO AS WELL AND HIS VIDEO PRODUCTION IS VERY HIGH QUALITY AND ENTERTAINING
AS SOMEONE WITH AN SO THAT HAS OCD THAT LAST COMMENT IS ALWAYS SO ANNOYING AS IT PERPETUATES A WRONG STEREOTYPE AND MAKES LIGHT OF A CONDITION THAT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO LIVE WITH OCD IS NOTHING LIKE MONK ON TV IT'S CLOSER TO JACK NICHOLSON IN AS GOOD AS IT GETS
RIVALS FOR CATAN SO MUCH FUN
GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL IS ANOTHER GOOD ONE IT ACTUALLY PLAYS SMOOTHER WITH 2 PLAYERS THAN IT DOES WITH
CUBE QUEST WAS PUT ON A BACK BURNER A WHILE AGO AND FORGOTTEN LOOKING AT IT AGAIN I KIND OF WANT TO GO OUT AND BUY IT ASK FOR IT FOR CHRISTMAS
SHERLOCK LOOKS REALLY FUN AND INTERESTING BUT I'M A BIT UPSET THAT THE GAME ONLY COMES WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF CASES CAN ANYONE CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE
GOOD STUFF FUN CHANNEL TOO

BRUGES I JUST PLAYED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH MY SO THIS LAST WEEK AND WE REALLY LIKE THE CLEVER CARD PLAY ALSO THE ART IS GORGEOUS IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE ONLY GAMES SHE REQUESTS TO PLAY ALONG WITH AKROTIRI WE HAVE STILL TO TRY MY COPY OF MARGI
RACE FOR THE GALAXY FOR THE DUDES PLAYING UNTIL A MASCULINE SITUATION SAY ANYTHING CODENAMES OR TELESTRATIONS FOR THE THE HOWLING FRIENDS

I FEEL LIKE IF YOUR BOARD GAME COLLECTION IS GOING TO BE SMALL OR GROW VERY SLOWLY A GAME WITH STRONG REPLACEABILITY LIKE RACE FOR THE GALAXY IS PERFECT

WONDERS SUISEI GO PARTY ARE VERY FUN AS WELL IF YOU CAN GET THE SAME GROUP OF PEOPLE PLAYING IT ENOUGH TO DEVELOP A METAGRAM I'VE NOT MANAGED TO DO SO WITH THE FORMER SO I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH IT
I PICKED UP PANDEMIC WITH OTB EXPANSION IT'S WAITING FOR ME AT HOME IS CARCASSONNE REALLY THAT GOOD OF A DEAL AT I REALLY LIKE TILE LAYING BUILD YOUR OWN MAPS KIND OF GAMES

NOTE NOT KINKY UNLESS KILTS ARE YOUR THING NO JUDGMENT
THE RAVENS OF HRI SAHASHRI
NONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BELOW WILL COME AS ANY SURPRISE TO THE SEASONED GAMER BUT BASED ON WHAT YOU CONSIDER ON THE RADAR I THINK IT MIGHT BE RELEVANT



BELOW ARE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE THE CLASSIC OR AT LEAST MODERN CLASSIC 2 PLAYER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL ENSURE YOU BOTH HAVE A TON OF FUN WITHOUT OVERWHELMING YOU



JAIPUR A FANTASTIC CARD GAME THAT HAS YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT TRYING TO MAKE SMART TRADES TO CREATE EFFICIENT SETS OF COMMODITIES THAT CAN THEN BE SOLD FOR A PREMIUM GREAT FUN AND A MODERN CLASSIC



HIVE GAMES TEND TO VEER TOWARDS THE ABSTRACT END OF THE SPECTRUM I EAST WITHOUT MUCH OF A THEME AND THIS GAME STANDS TALL AMONG THE OTHERS IN THE GENRE A LOT OF PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS INSECT CHESS BUT DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU AWAY THIS IS A FANTASTIC STRATEGIC TILE LAYING GAME THAT IS WELL-REGARDED BY MANY GAMERS



PANDEMIC IT ISN'T TWO PLAYER ONLY PLAYS UP TO BUT IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL COOPERATIVE GAME YOU THINK COMPETING IS FUN TRY WORKING TOGETHER TO RID THE WORLD OF NASTY DISEASES



BATTLE LINE SIMPLE YET DEEPLY STRATEGIC THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES EVER MADE BY ONE OF THE GREATEST BOARD GAME DESIGNERS REINER KNIAZI YOU ARE COMPETING WITH YOUR OPPONENT TO MAKE SETS OF CARDS TO CLAIM FLAGS ON THE BATTLE LINE SO ELEGANT AND SO GOOD THIS WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED AS SCHOUTEN TOTTEN AND THAT ORIGINAL THEME WAS RECENTLY



HOPE THAT HELPS LET US KNOW WHAT YOU FINALLY DECIDED TO PLAY BUY AND HOW YOU ENJOYED THE GAMES HAVE FUN
QUANTUM

MY WIFE AND I LOVE THIS GAME REALLY CAN'T SPEAK HIGHLY ENOUGH OF IT GOT ME INTO THE WHOLE HOBBY AND EVERY TIME I GO BACK TO IT I AM AMAZED AT THE ELEGANCE OF ITS DESIGN GET IT AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT
AND THEN WE HELD HANDS GRANTED I HAVE NOT YET PAYED IT MY COPY IS STILL ON ROUTE BUT THE GAME SIMULATES A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OTHER PLAYER AND YOU HAVE TO MANAGE YOUR EMOTIONS AND HELP MAKE MOVES AVAILABLE FOR THE OTHER PLAYER DEPENDING ON WHAT CARDS YOU HAVE BUT YOU MAY NOT TALK ABOUT THE GAME TO THE OTHER PLAYER SO YOU HAVE TO TRY SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING OR THINKING BUT YOU CAN NOT TALK ABOUT ANYTHING GAME RELATED

I READ ITS TO SHOW HOW WE TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT NOT REALLY OUR PROBLEMS AND WHATS WORRYING US

AGAIN THIS IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE GAME BEFORE HAVING ACTUALLY PLAYED IT THE GAME IS ONLY FOR 2 PLAYERS
MIGHT HELP IF WE KNEW WHAT YOU CONSIDERED ON THE RADAR
DUEL OF AGES II IS WORTH A PEEK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY OFF THE RADAR FOR THIS SUB BUT JAIPUR AND PATCHWORK ARE PRETTY GREAT ONLY GAMES

WE ALSO LOVE PLAYING TIME STORIES AND SEASONS TOGETHER
MAGE KNIGHT OR THEY BOTH HAVE SEX VERSIONS TOO
ON THE RADAR AT LEAST FOR THIS SUB BUT PATCHWORK AS MENTIONED WONDERS DUEL AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL
TL R

CATAN JUNIOR
TICKET TO RIDE FIRST JOURNEY
CLANK
MICE MYSTICS
APPARENTLY I NEED TO LOOK INTO CLANK FOR MY KIDS KEEP HEARING ABOUT IT
PRETTY SURE CELESTIA IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR JUST PLAYED THIS

U GETINFO
SOUNDS LIKE CELESTIA
WELL YOU ALREADY GOT YOUR ANSWER

I JUST DROPPED BY TO SAY THAT I LIKED HOW YOU SUMMARISED THE RULES OF THE GAME
THE ONE AND ONLY MEET UP I WENT TO I PLAYED WITH A GUY WHO LICKED HIS FINGERS SO HE COULD GET A GRIP ON ON THE WONDERS CARDS BEFORE DEALING PRETTY GROSS HABIT DOUBLY SO BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN HIS GAME
DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE A CON JUST A LARGE GROUP ONE PERSON IS SICK AND SOON EVERYONE ELSE GETS IT
SEEING AS I'VE BEEN IN A FEW GAMES WORKSHOPS THAT SMELL LIKE HOCKEY RINK LOCKER ROOMS I FEEL THAT MANY IN THE HOBBY HAVE ISSUES WITH HYGIENE HECK DIDN'T DICE TOWER I THINK OR WAS IT SOMEONE ELSE PUT OUT SOME CON ETIQUETTE VIDEOS A COUPLE YEARS BACK AND ONE WAS TAKE REGULAR SHOWERS
ATTENDED A LOCAL CON TWO WEEKENDS AGO OVER THE DURATION I MUST HAVE SEEN A DOZEN MEN HEAD STRAIGHT FROM THE URINALS TO THE GAME FLOOR AS I WASHED MY HANDS LIKE SOME KINDA GERMANOPHOBE

NOTICING THIS DEFINITELY MAKES ME WANT TO PLAY PURCELL POLICE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO RUNNING ANY GAMES IN THE FUTURE
GOT IT DON'T GO TO CONS ANYMORE BURN ALL CLOTHES I EVER WORE TO ONE THANKS GOING TO GO VOMIT
JUST ONE THING IF NOSE BLOWER USED A KLEENEX AND HAND SANITIZER WHAT ELSE COULD HE HAVE DONE MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AVOID BEING SICK AT WILL
THANKS FOR THE CLICKBAIT HEADLINE THAT'S GREAT
NOT TOUCHING YOUR FACE MOUTH IS IMPORTANT I WORK IN THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE DIVISION OF A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND I STILL SEE PEOPLE RUBBING THEIR FACE ADJUSTING THEIR HAIR AFTER WORKING WITH PATHOGENS OR NOT WASHING THEIR HANDS IN THE BATHROOM IT'S INCREDIBLE

FOR THE RECORD AUREL DOES NEXT TO NOTHING AND IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR WASHING YOUR HANDS BEST BET IS TO NOT EAT DRINK OR TOUCH YOUR FACE AFTER HANDLING COMMON GAMES UNTIL YOU WASH YOUR HANDS
THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE AT ANY LARGE PUBLIC OR EVENT CONVENTIONS CRUISES CONCERTS ETC THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO COMPLETELY NEGLECT HYGIENE AND OR DON'T CHANGE THEIR HABITS WHEN THEY GET SICK

I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE OF UPBRINGING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW PERSONALLY THAT I DIDN'T HAVE VERY GOOD HYGIENE EITHER UNTIL AFTER I LIVED WITH A WOMAN FOR A WHILE SHE STRAIGHTENED THAT CRAP OUT PRETTY QUICK AND I HAVEN'T LOOKED BACK XD
THANKS BUZZFEED DAD
THAT'S DISGUSTING
I BELIEVE HAND SANITIZER WOULD MERELY SELECT FOR THE BACTERIA THAT ARE RESISTANT AND THUS HELP CREATE AN ILLNESS THAT IS NO LONGER AFFECTED BY YOUR ATTEMPTS TO KILL IT ALTERNATIVELY THEY MAY BE VIRUSES AND THUS THE SANITIZER IS LIKE HIDING BEHIND A TOILET PAPER DISPLAY WHEN SOMEONE IS SHOOTING A NUKE AT YOU THEN THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE IS NO ILLNESS AT ALL BUT IT IS JUST THE NATURAL BODILY REACTION TO THE CHANGING SEASON SINUSES SWELL GOING FROM COLD TO WARM MAKES NOSES RUNNY ETC SO IT IS LIKE GOING TO YOUR CORNER GROCERY STORE IN A TANK BECAUSE SOMEONE MY TRY TO SHOOT YOU

OKAY I GET IT YOU ARE REALLY GROSSED OUT BY THE AVERAGE HABITS OF HUMAN BEINGS AND THE PREVALENT NATURE OF OUR HUMAN SLIMINESS HOWEVER I'M GOING TO OFFER YOU A MORE PROACTIVE SOLUTION OVER DEMANDING EVERYONE CHANGE AND DO IT YOUR WAY BRING DISPOSABLE COTTON GLOVES USE THEM FOR A GAME DAY TO AVOID CONTACT WITH ALL THE NASTY BITS AND THEN DISPOSE OF THEM WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE PUTTING THEM ON AND AFTER TAKING THEM OFF AND MY WASH YOUR HANDS THAT MEANS LATHER AND RUB FOR A BIT MAKE SURE TO DO UNDER THE NAILS BETWEEN FINGERS BOTH SIDES OF THE HAND AND GO UP THE FOREARM A BIT NOT THE PUT THE SOAP IN YOUR HAND RUB YOUR PALMS AND RINSE METHOD THAT I SEE SO FEW DO AS SO MANY DON'T WASH THEIR HANDS AT ALL EEEEW ALSO SHOWER RIGHT AWAY AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY LAUNDRY SERVICES YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IE WASH THOSE GERM COVERED CLOTHES RIGHT AWAY DON'T PUT THEM IN A FESTERING BAG OR SUITCASE OF TO DO WHEN I GET HOME SOURCE MY WIFE IS AN EMT ONE TIME SHE WAS DOING CLINICAL IN AT A HOSPITAL WHEN A MAN HAD LOOSE STOOLS LEAK EVERYWHERE SHE CAME HOME AND THREW HER CLOTHES IN THE WASHER AND IMMEDIATELY DOUBLE SCRUBBED IN A SHOWER ANOTHER TIME SHE HAD A CALL WITH A SICK PATIENT AND SHE CAME HOME AND WASHED HER CLOTHES AND SHOWERED AGAIN HER FELLOW VOLUNTEERS DIDN'T GUESS WHICH ONES GOT SICK AND WHICH ONE DIDN'T ALSO AS AN EMT GLOVES DON'T TOUCH YOUR FACE EYE COVERAGE AND OR FACE MASKS AND LEARNING HOW TO REMOVE GLOVES WITHOUT TOUCHING THE EXTERIORS ARE ALL GOOD HABIT SKILLS TO LEARN THE EMT NEEDS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN EXPECT AN ILL PATIENT TO PROTECT THEM

LISTEN I WORKED IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR PEOPLE TO AVOID THEIR SUBCONSCIOUS GROOMING BEHAVIORS UNLESS YOU WORK IN AN INDUSTRY WHERE YOU COULD HARM YOURSELF OR OTHERS BY TOUCHING YOUR FACE AND HAIR YOU'LL PROBABLY NOT UNDERSTAND JUST HOW STRONG THE HUMAN IMPULSE TO GROOM IS BECAUSE YOU'LL JUST DO IT EVEN IF YOU GET COMPLIANCE YOU'LL STILL HAVE SICKNESS SPREAD IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET SICK LEARN HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF RATHER THAN COME UP WITH REQUIREMENTS THAT OTHERS HAVE TO DO FOR EXAMPLE I WASH MY HANDS IN A PUBLIC RESTROOM AND THEN USE THE PAPER TOWEL TO GRAB THE DOOR HANDLE WHY AS I SAID MOST PEOPLE DON'T WASH THEIR HANDS FORTUNATELY MOST THAT DEFECATE DO ALAS I SAID MOST AND NOT ALL AND AS I NOTED EARLIER THE VAST MAJORITY THAT DO DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY WASH THEIR HANDS FAR TOO MANY MERELY RINSE WATER OVER THEIR HANDS AND SO MANY FAIL TO SCRUB PROPERLY I TAKE IT UPON MYSELF TO PROTECT ME FROM THEIR GERMS BECAUSE THE AVERAGE PERSON IS JUST TOO OBLIVIOUS TO WHAT THEY ARE DOING WRONG

OH AND IF YOU'RE FLYING WELL PROBABLY NO REASON TO BOTHER PROTECTING YOURSELF WHEN YOU'RE PUT IN A METAL TUBE WITH A SMALL CLOSED AIR SYSTEM CIRCULATING THE DISEASES AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND YOU'RE GETTING SICK IF YOU DON'T TAKE ANY PRECAUTIONS BEYOND SANITIZING YOUR HANDS BUT HEY BRIGHT SIDE YOU'RE BUILDING UP A GREAT IMMUNE SYSTEM IF YOU DON'T DIE
YEAH I'VE SEEN THAT BEHAVIOR BEFORE AT LOCAL METUMPS WE CARRY AROUND BOTTLES OF HAND SANITIZER TO CONS ANYMORE FOR THIS REASON I THINK IN GENERAL THAT PEOPLE ARE LESS AWARE OF THEIR ACTIONS THAN THEY PERCEIVE
WATCH V BOARS
AND THAT IS HOW CON FLU SPREADS
I'VE NEVER PLAYED WITH STRANGERS AND NOW I FEEL DISCOURAGED OF DOING IT
REMINDS ME OF THE REPORTS OF PEOPLE GETTING OCULAR HERPES FROM SAMPLING VR HEADSETS AT VIDEO GAME SHOWS
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THE SWIMMING IN RAW SEWAGE SOLUTION
AND MY PROBLEM IS THAT I HAVE A NERVOUS TIC COUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M IN AN INTENSE SITUATION OR HAVE HAD A BIT TOO MUCH CAFFEINE HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT I'M NOT RECKLESSLY SPREADING A COLD AROUND AND YET UNDERSTANDABLY SOME PEOPLE'S CAN'T GET THAT CONSCIOUS INFORMATION TO THEIR SUBCONSCIOUS GERM AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS WHICH IS A BUMMER FOR BOTH OF US

I JUST CAME FROM A CON AND YEP GOT THE SICKNESS FROM THE DEMO STATIONS I CARRY A TRAVEL HAND SANITIZER WITH ME
I'VE ONLY BEEN TO 2 BOARD GAME CONSONANT GOT SICK AT BOTH

USE THE GEL PEOPLE
MY WIFE AND I RUN A BOARD GAME NIGHT AT A LOCAL TEEN CENTER SOME OF THE YOUNGER KIDS ARE STILL ETC WE'RE LARGELY BRINGING IN OUR OWN GAMES I WILL CALL OUT A KID WHO'S DOING SOMETHING UNSANITARY ASK THEM TO GO WASH THEIR HANDS AND THEN EXPLAIN WHY I'M ASKING THEM TO DO IT
YOU ARE NOT ALONE I FIND MYSELF NOT ENJOYING SOME OF THE GAMES WITH MY GROUP AT HOME WHEN I SPEND ALL NIGHT WATCHING OUT FOR POTENTIAL DRINK SPILLS AND DIRTY HANDS
ON A SIDE NOTE AND ANOTHER THREAD I RANTED BEFORE

NERDS GEEKS ENTHUSIAST WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL YOURSELF CLEAN UP THERE IS NO REASON FOR YOU TO REEK THERE IS NO REASON FOR YOU TO BE GROSS BE CONSIDERATE TO OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS AND FURTHER MORE STORE OWNERS OF FAGS JUST BECAUSE YOUR CLIENTS ARE OFTEN THIS NERD TYPES DON'T LET YOUR STORE FALL INTO IT
I KNOW THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BUT THIS IS WHY I FEAR GOING TO BOARD GAME METUMPS I GUESS I DON'T OFFER TO BRING MY OWN
OR AT LEAST KEEP YOUR HANDS AWAY FROM YOUR MOUTH WHILE PLAYING

USED TO PLAY WITH A GUY WHO WOULD CONSTANTLY PUT THE PIECES IN HIS MOUTH REALLY NICE GUY JUST BECAME TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS WHEN HE WAS IN MODE

SHORTLY AFTER A LADY WHO WAS TAKING THE DEMO WAS SNIFFLING AND OBVIOUSLY A BIT SICK SHE COUGHED INTO HER HAND AND THEN TOUCHED THE CARDS

YEA THAT PISSES ME OFF A BIT NOW I KNOW CONVENTIONS HAVE A FAIRLY HIGH TIME MONEY COST FOR MOST PEOPLE BUT IF YOU ARE SICK AT LEAST WEAR A MASK


GOOD PREVENTION HAND SANITIZER AND DON'T TOUCH YOUR FACE EVER
IT IS INDEED ANOTHER FACTOR OF HYGIENE THAT TRANSCENDS THE STEREOTYPES ONE MAY NORMALLY EXPECT BEING AWARE OF WHAT YOU TOUCH WHERE YOU TOUCH ETC HELPS ESPECIALLY IN ENVIRONMENTS LIKE BOARD GAMING AS WELL AS CHILDREN I FEAR WHEN IF MY KID DOESN'T HAVE THE COGNIZANCE REQUIRED AND GIVES ME PINK-EYE
THIS IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS KIND OF VIDEO FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS NOT ONLY FOR GAMING BUT OTHER INCLUSIVE THINGS

LET ME SPLIT MY COMMENT INTO TWO PARTS



MOST OF LET'S MAKE WOMEN MINORITIES FEEL SPECIAL TALKS MAKE ME SICK IN PART BECAUSE I HAD MORE THAN A FEW EXPERIENCES OF BEING A MINORITY UNDER VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES I REALLY WANT TO BRING THROATPUNCH MAGIC TO THOSE SELF PROCLAIMED HOLY WARRIORS OF JUSTICE

AT THE SAME TIME SUZANNE AND MANDI ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE IN A WHILE I SEE TALKING ABOUT NOT BEING SPECIAL BUT NORMAL THAT'S WHAT IS IMPORTANT AND CRUCIAL SINGLING PEOPLE OUT OR MAKING HUGE SIGNS OF N ARE ESPECIALLY WELCOMED JUST BUILDS A WALL ENFORCES INSECURITY AND CREATES A COMPLEX FOR PEOPLE SO THE NEXT TIME SOME N WILL GET IN A CONFLICT FIRST THING WILL BE ABOUT N BEING N NOT ACTIONS FROM OR TOWARDS THAT PERSON

ALSO SUZANNE MADE A GREAT POINT BY GOING TO THOSE CONVENTIONS AND OPENLY ENJOYING THE HOBBY SHE DID MUCH MORE THAN ALL THOSE SHOUTING ILLUSTRIOUS PROTECTORS

SO YEAH I PERSONALLY HATE ON THOSE PEOPLE CARVING FOR BROWNIE POINTS FOR BEING LIBERAL BUT MY DO I RESPECT AND LIKE SUZANNE EVEN MORE NOW
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I PERSONALLY DO I TRY TO BRING ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND PEERS INTO HOBBY KIDS OLDER FOLKS MALE FEMALE DOESN'T MATTER WE ALL COULD ENJOY THE GAME AND FOR ME IT ACTUALLY MAKES FOR DISTRIBUTION WITHOUT ANY INTENT IF SOMEBODY HAS ONLY MALE FEMALE AS FRIENDS I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM NOT GAMING OR COMMUNITY

2 REPRESENTATION

YES YES YES

THEY NAILED IT PERFECTLY HERE WHEN IT MAKES SENSE

AND NOW BECAUSE WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FEMALES OR BEARDED FAT GUYS OR WHATEVER ELSE BUT BECAUSE FAIR REPRESENTATION MAKES FOR BETTER RICHER EXPERIENCE IN GAMES

I WANT TO SEE PEOPLE OF MIDDLE AGES EUROPE IN GAMES ABOUT MIDDLE AGES EUROPE I WANT TO SEE AFRICAN TRIBESMEN OF CENTURY IN GAMES ABOUT AFRICAN TRIBESMEN IN CENTURY

AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO SEE MORE THERE TO LEARN MORE TO GET MORE FROM THOSE GAMES
ADD A MERCHANT FROM MIDDLE EAST OR CENTRAL ASIA TO EUROPE THEY WERE THERE
ADD CHINESE EXPLORERS TO AFRICA THEY WERE THERE AND SINCE IT'S NOT A VERY COMMON KNOWLEDGE TELL ME WHY AND HOW IT COULD MAKE FOR A MUCH FUNNIER AND INTERESTING EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE


IT WAS A GREAT TALK THANK YOU SUZANNE AND MANDI I THINK YOU MANAGED WHAT MOST PEOPLE CAN'T LEAVE OUT ALL POLITICS AND SHOW HOW TO MAKE LIFE BETTER AND COZIER FOR EVERYONE
INCLUSIVENESS AS A PERSONAL TRAIT IS FANTASTIC I THINK THE WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE WHEN MORE PEOPLE ARE KIND AND WELCOMING

AS AN IDEOLOGY MOVEMENT CAUSE I'M LESS CLEAR ABOUT THE SPECIFIC GOALS FOR INSTANCE IS IT DESIRABLE TO HAVE AN EVEN GENDER SPLIT IN GAMING AND HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT ACHIEVING SUCH A BALANCE

I AM CONSTANTLY TRYING PERHAPS STUPIDLY BUT AT LEAST WITH A SENSE OF HOPE TO GET PEOPLE TO PLAY WARGAMES MY SUCCESS RATE FOR MALE GAMERS IS MAYBE A COUPLE PERCENT BUT MY SUCCESS RATE FOR FEMALE GAMERS IS EXACTLY

IF ANYBODY KNOWS WARGAMERS THEN THEY KNOW THAT IT IS FAR MORE HOMOGENEOUS THAN THE GENERAL GAMING POPULATION WHAT ELSE CAN I DO TO TRY AND GET WOMEN TO PLAY WARGAMERS THEN CONSTANTLY INVITE THEM TO DO SO DESPITE GETTING NOTHING BUT LAUGHTER AND BEWILDERMENT IN RETURN

IT MAY NOT BE A CHEERY THOUGHT BUT I THINK IT HELPS TO KEEP IN MIND HOW NATURALLY TRIBAL AND EXCLUSIONARY HUMAN BEINGS CAN BE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES TO NAVIGATE THESE WATERS BUT I THINK A VARIANT OF RAZOR APPLIES HERE EVEN AS THE ALL-POWERFUL WHITE MALE I DON'T WALK INTO NEW GROUPS ESPECIALLY GROUPS OF NERDS AND HAVE THE RED CARPET ROLLED OUT FOR ME IT USUALLY TAKES MONTHS OF CONSTANTLY SHOWING MY FACE AND FORCING INTERACTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO EVEN REMEMBER MY NAME AND TO BEGIN TREATING ME AS ANYTHING BUT WALLPAPER

REGARDING REPRESENTATION I THINK VARIETY IS GREAT BUT I FIND THAT THE CULTURAL APPROPRIATION TABOO HAS CREATED A BIT OF A CATCH I USED TO WRITE A LOT MORE IN MY YOUNGER DAYS AND I WAS KEENLY AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF WRITING FEMALE OR MINORITIES CHARACTERS POORLY IF I BOTCHED A WHITE MALE CHARACTER IT WOULD JUST BE A SIGN OF INEPTITUDE IF I BOTCHED A MINORITY CHARACTER IT COULD BE SEEN AS AN ATTACK

I FIND IT COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO WANT A DIVERSITY IN ARTISTIC REPRESENTATION BUT THEN ALLOW PEOPLE ONLY THE RIGHT OF AUTOBIOGRAPHY STILL I ACCEPT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS AND I SUGGEST THAT THE SOLUTION IS TO GET MORE FEMALE AND MINORITY DESIGNERS PUBLISHERS AND ARTISTS SO THEY CAN REPRESENT THEMSELVES AS THEY CHOOSE
I UNDERSTAND WANTING TO BE INCLUSIVE AND I WOULD NEVER TURN A WOMAN AWAY OR ANYONE FROM A GAME BUT COULD THE PROBLEM BE AS SIMPLE AS THE OVERALL MAKEUP OF GAMERS ISN'T

MAYBE THERE ARE JUST MORE MEN IN THE HOBBY AND THAT'S THAT

IF I WENT TO A CONVENTION ABOUT FISHING AND TACKLE WOULD I BE UPSET IF IT WAS MOSTLY GUYS AND THERE WERE NO WOMEN

OR BETTER YET IF I WENT TO A TRADE SHOW ABOUT KNITTING OR SCRAP BOOKING WOULD I BE MAD THAT IT'S MOSTLY WOMEN

NONE OF THESE HOBBIES SHOULD BE EXCLUSIVE TO ONE GENDER OR THE OTHER BUT SOMETIMES THAT JUST HAPPENS WHY DO MY DAUGHTERS PLAY WITH BARBIES AND NOT TRANSFORMERS

ALSO IN THE YOUTUBE COMMENTS SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT GOING TO GAME STORES AND NOT SEEING ANY WOMEN AND THEREFORE NOT FEELING WELCOME SOMEONE UNFORTUNATELY HAS TO MAKE THE FIRST STEP THERE CAN'T BE ALL WOMEN GAMERS SAYING THERE ARE NO WOMEN PLAYING AT GAME STORES SO I DON'T GO PLAY

I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE WELCOMING TO NEW PLAYERS NO MATTER WHAT GENDER RACE ETC THEY ARE BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THE HOBBY WILL BE A SPLIT ANY TIME SOON
COULD YOU IMAGINE IF EVERY PSIG EUROS THREAD DEVOLVED IN TO PEOPLE SAYING THEY ARE SICK OF HEARING ABOUT EUROS AND THAT PEOPLE WHO LIKE EUROS SHOULD STOP TALKING ABOUT THEM FOR THE MOST PART I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY WOULD JUST SKIP OVER THAT THREAD IF THEY DIDN'T LIKE EURO GAMES

THIS WAS AN INTERESTING VIDEO AND IT WAS GREAT TO HEAR DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES FROM THESE TWO PRESENTERS I DON'T OFTEN WATCH THEIR SEGMENTS BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO GIVE THEM A GO IN THE FUTURE
I THOUGHT THESE SPEAKERS AND THESE COMMENTS HANDLED THIS TOPIC WELL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME THIS TOPIC IS ACTUALLY ABOUT EQUALITY INSTEAD OF SUPERIORITY I REALLY HATE JOINING IN ON THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT HOW AS A STRAIGHT WHITE MALE I RUIN EVERYTHING BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT PROGRESS

I WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE AS MUCH FUN IN MY HOBBIES AS I DO BRING ON MORE NEW GAMERS IF YOU'RE NICE COOL AND HYGIENIC AND LIVE NEARBY YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME AT MY TABLE MORE GAMERS MORE DESIGNERS MORE GAMES MORE VARIETY
IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS VIDEO I WISH TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE PLEASE REMEMBER THIS IS NOT A JUDGEMENT BUT QUESTIONS TO HELP WITH SELF-AWARENESS AND PROVIDE INTROSPECTION AND ALSO YOUR ANSWERS WILL HELP ME REFLECT BETTER ON VIEWPOINTS

DO WOMEN IN GAMING TRULY FEEL THAT THESE TYPES OF JUDGEMENTS AND ACTIONS ARE EXCLUSIVE TO THEM OR ONLY TO NON WHITE HETEROSEXUAL MALE GAMERS

2 IF YOU ARE A MINORITY GAMER DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU ARE STEREOTYPING ALL WHITE HETEROSEXUAL MALES AS HEAVILY BIASED AND EXCLUSIVE

DO YOU THINK ONLY NON WHITE HETEROSEXUAL GAMERS ARE THE ONLY ONES TO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE FIRST BEING JUDGED BY THEIR APPEARANCE AND THEN VIEWED AS INCOMPETENT IN GAMING

SHOULD CONVENTIONS BE THE ONE HELD RESPONSIBLE IF NON WHITE HETEROSEXUAL GAMERS DON'T BUY TICKETS OR SHOW UP



OKAY NOW TO TALK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES AS A WHITE HETEROSEXUAL GAMER ALL MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN THE ODD ONE THE OUTSIDER THE PICKED ON NEW KID OR THE GEEK NERD I HAVE HAD GANGS OF BOYS CHASE AFTER ME ON THEIR BIKES YELLING ABOUT HOW THEY WERE GOING TO BEAT ME UP I'VE BEEN SHOT IN MY ASS WITH A BB GUN BY ANOTHER BOY I WAS MOCKED AND TEASED BECAUSE I PLAYED OFTEN WITH GIRLS AND WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND I WAS TEASED FOR THE TYPES OF TOYS AND GAMES I PLAYED IN THE I GOT INTO THE TABLETOP RPG SCENE AND IT PROVIDED ME AN OUTLET WHERE OTHER OUTCASTS LIKE ME FELT ACCEPTED AND WELCOMED

MY BOARD GAMING HISTORY BEGAN IN THE WITH FAMILY GAMING WHICH MEANS I PLAYED WITH 2 SISTERS AND OCCASIONALLY MY MOTHER MY FATHER DIDN'T LIKE TO PLAY BOARD GAMES IN THE MY GIRLFRIEND HER BOYFRIEND AND SOME PEOPLE I MET BY GOING TO AN RPG COLLEGE CLUB BECAME MY GAMING GROUP I WILL SAY IT WAS PRETTY MUCH DOMINATED BY VERY NERDY AND SOCIALLY OUTCAST WHITE HETEROSEXUAL MALES ONE WAS VERY TALL AND HEAVY ONE WAS VERY TALL AND LIGHT EVENTUALLY THERE WAS THE ABUSED CHILD WHO SEEMED TO BE SUFFERING PTSD AND ALWAYS NEEDED TO PLAY THE TOUGH LONE WOLF CHARACTER WHO BORDERED ON EVIL AND THERE WAS THE STONER SURFER GUY WHO WAS A CHILL HIPPY TYPE NONE OF US WERE REALLY SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BOYFRIEND FIRST GOT INTO ANIME AND THEN EVENTUALLY BECAME A JAPANOPHILE WHO MARRIED A JAPANESE WOMAN AND MOVED OVERSEAS AND I ASSUME HE IS STILL THERE TO THIS DAY NONE OF US FELT COMFORTABLE WALKING INTO A ROOM AND ALL OF US WHITE MALE HETEROSEXUALS FELT LIKE WE WERE CONSTANTLY JUDGED

IN THE I MET MY WIFE AND AFTER FAILING TO GET BACK INTO TABLETOP RAGS AS ON AFTER A FEW YEARS HIATUS WAS TOO DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY SINCE SHE WASN'T COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF ROLEPLAYING WE EVENTUALLY SETTLED ON BOARDGAMES WE MAINLY PLAYED WITH HER FAMILY OR WITH JUST THE TWO OF US

ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WE APPROACHED SEVERAL PEOPLE TO TRY OUT A PNP REVIEW COPY OF FORAGERS TWO PEOPLE WE ASKED CAME BY LATER THAT EVENING AND SAID THEY WOULD BE GLAD TO COME AND TRY IT A FEW DAYS LATER AND WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH ABOUT ONCE A WEEK ON AVERAGE SINCE WHEN WE PLAY AT OUR FAGS ON GAME NIGHTS WE GLADLY PLAY WITH OTHERS WHEN WE HAVE ROOM OR WHEN THEY HAVE ROOM HOWEVER TO THIS DAY I STILL SUFFER APPROACH ANXIETY AND HAVE AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TIME FEELING LIKE I'M NOT BEING JUDGED

DO YOU PEOPLE REMEMBER TERMS LIKE NECKBEARD OR GROGNARD THOSE ARE DEROGATORY TERMS I'VE HEARD MANY WHITE HETEROSEXUAL MALE GAMERS CALLED AND NOT IN A KIND WAY WE ALL SUFFER JUDGEMENT ESPECIALLY MANY OF US WHO GRAVITATE TO THE FANTASY WORLDS OF TABLETOP GAMING

SO LETS GET TO THE VIDEO

ONE THING MENTIONED WAS BEING APPROACHED AND ASSUMED TO KNOW SOMETHING SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE BEEN IN A CHAIN STORE WEARING THE SAME COLOR SHIRT AS EMPLOYEES AND HAD CUSTOMERS APPROACH ME LIKE AN EMPLOYEE BEING JUDGED BY APPEARANCE HAPPENS TO US ALL IT IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO MINORITY GAMERS

ANOTHER IS HAVING A PLAYER TELL YOU WHAT THE RIGHT MOVE IS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS I'VE ENCOUNTERED AND BEEN AT THE RECEIVING END OF THIS GAMER I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT WAS MENTIONED THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE TABLE WEREN'T TALKING THAT WAY OR BEING TALKED AT THAT WAY THIS MEANS THAT AT LEAST 2 OUT OF PEOPLE WERE NOT TELLING HER WHAT THE RIGHT MOVE WAS BUT IT FELT LIKE THE ACCUSATION WAS SHE WAS BEING JUDGED BY ETHNICITY AND GENDER AT THE TABLE IT WAS THAT ONE ASSHOLE GAMER WHO DID THAT NOT THE MAJORITY OF THE HOBBYISTS

I FOUND REPRESENTATION ARGUMENTS TO BE THE SAME OLD MANTRA I BELIEVE THEY MENTIONED THE LACK OF WOMEN AND THE HISTORICAL EXCUSE BUT I AM A HISTORICAL PURIST WHEN I PLAY A CIVIL WAR GAME I DON'T WANT AN ASIAN FEMALE GRANT OR BLACK TRANSGENDER LEE IN THE GAME OF COURSE WHEN I PLAY A MEDIEVAL FANTASY GAME I WANT A BIT OF REALISM TOO SO I WANT WOMEN IN REALISTIC ARMOR IE NO BIKINIS AND NO BOOB CHEST PLATE ARMOR HOWEVER I AM A HETEROSEXUAL MALE SO I DON'T DISLIKE SUCH ART JUST AS I'VE ENCOUNTERED WOMEN WHO DIDN'T MIND THE UNREALISTIC BARBARIAN PHYSIQUE AND ARMOR SET PUT FORTH BY BARBARIAN TROPES ALSO WHERE IS THE ANGER ABOUT HAVING ANTI-INTELLECTUAL DRUNKARD BARBARIAN MALES WITH UNREALISTIC PHYSIQUES

WHAT I DID FIND DISTURBING WAS THEY LIKED TO PUT THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT THEY HAVE ISSUES WITH GAMES BEING DESIGNED WITH ALL WHITE MALE CHARACTERS BUT HAVE NO ISSUES WITH EXCLUSIVENESS IN GAMES WITH ALL BLACK OR ALL FEMALE CHARACTERS I TEND TO GRAVITATE TO GAMES THAT DON'T REPRESENT THE PLAYER AND ARE ABSTRACTED CASTLES OF BURGUNDY ORA ET LABARA ROADS BOATS AGRICOLA PORTA HIGRA SEELAND EXTRA EXTRA PUERTO RICO SAN JUAN AND SO MANY MORE OR ARE HISTORICAL REPRESENTATIONS HOWEVER I DO APPRECIATED GAMES THAT GIVE PLAYERS THE CHOICE OF PLAYER COLOR AND GENDER WHEN THERE ARE REPRESENTATIONS LIKE LEGENDS OF ANDOR WITH ITS MALE AND FEMALE SIDE WOULD I BUY A GAME THAT WAS DRIVEN IN PRICE FOR HAVING VARIOUS ETHNICITIES REPRESENTED WITH EACH CHARACTER GENDER CARD ALSO I DON'T THINK SO

AS TO CONSTANT QUESTIONING DURING RULES I DO IT OCCASIONALLY DUE TO PROJECTION I TEND TO THOSE THINGS I STRUGGLED WITH AND SKIM OVER THE BITS I GOT QUICKLY ADDITIONALLY I TEND TO INTERACT WITH THOSE WHO PUT FORTH AN EFFORT TO BE ATTENTIVE AND TRY TO BE ESTABLISHED IN THE SOCIAL EXCHANGE I'M GOING TO STEREOTYPE A BIT BUT DO YOU WANT TO GUESS WHO TENDS TO BE MORE ATTENTIVE AND SOCIALLY INTERACTIVE WOMEN ITS LIKE THE OLD JOKE THAT MEN WON'T ASK FOR DIRECTIONS WHEN LOST WELL THEY DON'T ASK FOR CLARIFICATIONS EITHER THEN AS ALWAYS WHEN SOMEONE EXPLAINS RULES TO ME I GET THINGS VERY WRONG BECAUSE I MISUNDERSTAND THEM SO I ASSUME OTHER PEOPLE ARE HORRIBLE AUDITORY LEARNERS LIKE ME

FINALLY I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A CONVENTION BUT I'VE WATCHED VIDEOS OF THEM SOME CONVENTIONS SUFFER FROM THE SAME PROBLEM AS WARGAMING AND THAT IS EITHER DIVERSE POPULATIONS DON'T SEEM TO BE DRAWN TO THAT SUBGENRE PERHAPS BECAUSE THE SIMULATIONIST NATURE OF IT IS NOT INCLUSIVE OR BECAUSE THEY VIEW HISTORY AS A BIASED SOURCE THAT IS IRRECONCILABLE OR 2 BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'D FIND OTHER LIKE THEM SO THEY STAY HOME ENSURING THAT OTHERS LIKE THEM WON'T BE THERE ITS A CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM WHEN YOU DON'T GO BECAUSE YOU NEVER SEE ANYONE LIKE YOU THERE THEN YOU CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AREN'T THERE SO PEOPLE LIKE YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND THEY CHOOSE TO NOT GO AND IT BECOMES A FEEDBACK LOOP OR SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY AND IF YOU JUST ALL WENT THEN THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE YOU TO GO GET IT I HARDLY THINK SAYING THE HOBBY IS NOT INCLUSIVE IS FAIR WHEN SO MANY MAKE AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT IT BEING NOT INCLUSIVE AND DON'T GO OKAY I HAVE NO HARD PROOF OF THIS I ONLY BASE IT ON WHAT I'VE SEEN IN POSTS ARTICLES AND VIDEOS ABOUT INCLUSIVENESS AND WHY PEOPLE AVOID CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS

SO THE TL R MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN EXCLUSION IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO THE MINORITY SEGMENT OF GAMERS WE'VE ALL BEEN JUDGED WE ALL FEEL JUDGED WE ALL HAVE HAD THE PLAYER WHO TELLS US WHAT TO DO WE'VE ALL GONE INTO A ROOM AND FELT THERE WAS NO ONE LIKE US AND WE ALL WANT TO FEEL INCLUDED PUTTING THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT IS NOT INCLUSIVENESS BUT ALSO NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE INCLUSIVE LOOK AT HOW HEAVILY INCLUSIVE THIS HOBBY IS RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON THE NEGATIVE EXAMPLES REALIZE JUST HOW INCLUSIVE THIS HOBBY IS

THE ABOVE WAS MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION I AM SURE THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH ME SO HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE THE START OF A CIVIL DISCOURSE ON INCLUSIVENESS AS THE TWO HOSTS OF OUR SHOW SUGGESTED THIS IS NOT A NEGATIVE JUDGEMENT BUT A CALLING OUT OF SOMETHING I THINK THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DEBATE MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED AFTER READING MY COMMENTS WATCH THE VIDEO A SECOND OR THIRD TIME THEN COME BACK AND READ MY QUESTION AND MAYBE MY COMMENTS AGAIN THEN PUT FORTH YOUR PART OF THE DISCUSSION AND I'LL TRY TO GET BACK AND READ THEM BUT I HAVE A GAME NIGHT TOMORROW SO IT MAY BE A WHILE BEFORE I GET BACK
I HAVE TO COMMENT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE ARGUMENTS SURROUNDING INCLUSIVENESS A LOT AND IF THIS WAS WHAT INCLUSIVE GAMING WAS ABOUT THEN THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO ARGUE ADDING MORE PEOPLE AND IMPROVING YOUR SOCIAL COMPETENCE IS ONLY POSITIVE

THIS IS IN STARK CONTRAST TO HOW MOST MALES APPROACH THE SUBJECT MANDI AND SUZANNE PROVIDE GREAT EXAMPLES AND FOOD FOR THOUGHT WITHOUT JUDGING PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEIR TASTE IS LIKE THEY DON'T TALK DOWN TO WOMEN WHO COPLAY IN REVEALING COSTUMES OR ABOUT PERVERTED ARTISTS WHO COULD BE MALE OR FEMALE

ONE THING I WOULD ADD THAT THEY KIND OF LEAVE OFF THE TABLE IS HOW SOME WOMEN VIEW MALE NERDS THIS ISN'T JUST A HOLLYWOOD STEREOTYPE BUT THERE ARE WOMEN WHO AVOID GAMING EVENTS LIKE THE PLAGUE BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW STATUS MEN YOU WILL SIMPLY NEVER GET A REPRESENTATION IN THE HOBBY WHILE THAT STIGMA EXISTS
I WAS READING A BOOK ABOUT INTERJECTIONS ODDLY ENOUGH YESTERDAY WHICH INCLUDED THE PHRASE IN THESE DAYS OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS TALKING ABOUT NO LONGER MAKING JOKES THAT DENIGRATED PEOPLE FOR THEIR CULTURE OR FOR THE COLOUR OF THEIR SKIN AND I THOUGHT THAT S NOT ACTUALLY ANYTHING TO DO WITH POLITICAL CORRECTNESS THAT S JUST TREATING OTHER PEOPLE WITH RESPECT

WHICH MADE ME ODDLY HAPPY I STARTED IMAGINING A WORLD IN WHICH WE REPLACED THE PHRASE POLITICALLY CORRECT WHEREVER WE COULD WITH TREATING OTHER PEOPLE WITH RESPECT AND IT MADE ME SMILE

YOU SHOULD TRY IT IT S PECULIARLY ENLIGHTENING

I KNOW WHAT YOU RE THINKING NOW YOU RE THINKING OH MY GOD THAT S TREATING OTHER PEOPLE WITH RESPECT GONE MAD

NEIL CAIMAN
BEEN ONLINE FOR AN HOUR AND IT HAS DISLIKES ON YOUTUBE

BUT REMEMBER THERE'S NO INCLUSIVENESS PROBLEM IN BOARD GAMING

FOR COMPARISON THE NEXT HIGHEST AMOUNT OF DISLIKES ON A BACKTALK VIDEO IS THIS ONE WITH WHICH HAS BEEN UP SINCE MAY 6TH AND THE HIGHEST AFTER THAT IS
SAD THAT THIS IS STILL SUCH A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC YES IT'S A COMMUNITY PROBLEM AND YES WE PERPETUATE IT

THE FACT THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THIS BRUSHBACK IS PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR WHY I GAME AT HOME I LOVE THE GAMES BUT CAN'T STAND THE CONSTANT INVALIDATION AND IDENTITY TARGETED MICROAGRESSIONS
SO GLAD TO SEE THIS CONVERSATION HAPPENING IT MAKES ME VERY SAD WHEN I'VE BEEN TO EVENTS AND ALMOST EVERYONE IS MALE PUTS MY GIRLFRIEND OFF COMING ALONG WHICH I'M SURE IS WHY MANY PEOPLE DON'T GO AS WELL

THE BIGGEST THING THAT EXCITES ME ABOUT BETTER DIVERSITY IN GAMES IS THAT IT WILL MEAN WE GET A MORE INTERESTING RANGE OF GAMES DESIGNERS WHO COME FROM ALL KINDS OF BACKGROUNDS WITH ALL KINDS OF IDEAS THERE IS STILL SO MUCH UNTAPPED POTENTIAL IN TABLETOP STILL
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE JUST STARTING A CONVERSATION BUT NO THIS STILL DOES NOTHING TO SELL ME ON THIS CONCEPT'S LEGITIMACY VALUE OR NECESSITY I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER SALES PITCH ABOUT IT

WE'RE INTERESTED IN GAMES BRINGING SOCIAL ISSUES HERE YOU CAN EXPECT THE INTERNET VERSION OF THE RESPONSE THAT TELEMARKETERS DOOR TO DOOR SALESPEOPLE AND RELIGIOUS SOLICITORS GET THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING

HELLO WHAT WERE YOU DOING TALKING ABOUT GAMES OH THAT'S NICE HAVE YOU ACCEPTED JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR

THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIORS YOU MAY THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YOU MAY THINK YOU HAVE THE SECRET TO ETERNAL LIFE BUT NOT EVERYONE AGREES MANY ARE NOT INTERESTED AND PEOPLE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF TELLING YOU SOME WILL NOT BE NICE

I'M HOPING THIS THREAD CAN BE CLOSED BECAUSE THIS HAS COME UP YET AGAIN AND I REALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS THE PLACE FOR IT
MAYBE MEN JUST LIKE PUZZLES MORE
STOP THESE VIDEOS AND THESE PLEASE STOP

PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE IF I DON'T WANT TO BE INCLUSIVE THEN THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO I DON'T WANT TO MAKE AN EXTRA EFFORT TO CATER TO ONE PARTICULAR GROUP OF PEOPLE MORE THAN ANOTHER AND I'M NOT AN ASSHOLE FOR DOING THAT I JUST DON'T CARE I GO TO GAME NIGHTS I AM POLITE AND FRIENDLY I PLAY THE GAMES I GO HOME I'M NOT SOME RAGING RACIST OR MISOGYNIST I JUST WANT TO COME PLAY GAMES AND GO HOME

IF SOMEONE COMES THROUGH THE DOOR I'LL SAY HELLO AND ASK THEM TO PLAY AT MY TABLE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INCLUSION I AM SIMPLY ASKING THEM TO PLAY BECAUSE I WANT PEOPLE TO PLAY AGAINST THEY COULD BE A MAN OR A WOMEN WHITE OR NOT OLD OR YOUNG I DON'T CARE NOT BEING INCLUSIVE IS DIFFERENT THAN BEING ACTIVELY EXCLUSIVE PLEASE REMEMBER THIS

I AM JUST SICK AND TIRED OF THESE TRENDS THAT ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE THESE MYSTERIOUS FORCES PREVENTING WOMEN AND RACIAL MINORITIES FROM PLAYING GAMES NOBODY IS STANDING AT THE DOOR AND BARRING ANYONE FROM ENTERING AND PLAYING GAMES WHEN YOU COME IN YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND HOPEFULLY GET A TABLE GOING THIS APPLIES TO ANYONE

AND AS FAR AS GAMING BEING WHITE AND MALE GOES LET ME GIVE YOU A MATH LESSON GAMING IS MOSTLY A MALE HOBBY IT IS THAT WAY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN THAT WAY THROUGHOUT HISTORY MEN ARE USUALLY IN COMPETITIONS AND SUCH AND BOARD GAMES ARE JUST ONE BRANCH OF THAT AS FAR AS WHITE PEOPLE IN THE HOBBY GOES CAUCASIAN PEOPLE MAKE UP AT LEAST OF THE PEOPLE IN AMERICA CENSUS THAT'S ABOUT IN AMERICANS IN MOST ANY HOBBY YOU WILL HAVE A MAJORITY OF WHITE PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S MATHEMATICS GAMING IS A HOBBY THAT IS MOSTLY MEN SO WHEN YOU ENTER A GAME STORE AND SEE WHITE MEN GAMING IT'S MATH NOT DISCRIMINATION

IT'S ACTUALLY A BIT IRONIC THAT THERE IS SO MUCH PUSH FOR FEMALE GAMERS IN THE HOBBY WHEN YOU SHOULD REALLY PUSH FOR MORE RACIAL DIVERSITY AS THE NEED IS GREATER CONSIDERING IN AMERICANS ARE WHITE

SO BEFORE THIS TOPIC GOES ANYWHERE EVERYONE INCLUDING THOSE SOCIAL JUSTICE FIGHTERS NEED TO SIT DOWN AND ABSORB THE FACTS WHICH ARE THAT GAMING IS MOSTLY MALE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY AND THAT MOST PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE WHITE

THE SECOND THING IS THAT IF PEOPLE AREN'T INCLUSIVE THEY AREN'T BAD PEOPLE THEY MAY SIMPLY NOT CARE ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT OR COULD BE LAZY AND THAT'S FINE IF I SEE A CAN ON THE GROUND AND I WALK PAST IT I AM NOT THE ONE THAT LITTERED I AM SIMPLY A BYSTANDER

THE REAL CULPRITS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE EXCLUSIONARY AS IN THE ONES THAT SAY NO WOMEN OR MINORITIES ALLOWED OR TREAT THEM WORSE AND IN THIS CASE I WILL AGREE AND SAY IT'S WRONG AND THAT PEOPLE COULD CALL THAT PERSON OUT AND SUPPORT THE PERSON BEING WRONGED

BUT TO GET IN MY FACE AND TELL ME TO BE INCLUSIVE THAT'S REALLY PANDERING AND NO I DO NOT NEED TO BE REMINDED OF THAT IT'S REALLY POINTLESS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY RACISTS AND SEXISTS WON'T LISTEN TO THAT ANYWAY AND THE DECENT PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW THIS IT'S LIKE TELLING AN ADULT TO WIPE THEIR BUTT AFTER THEY FLUSH AND SAYING GOOD BOY AND GIVING THEM A TREATISE

AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT ASSHOLES CAN COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES THERE CAN BE WOMEN THAT ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE THERE CAN BE MINORITIES THAT ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE THERE CAN BE WHITE MEN THAT ARE VICTIMS WE NEED TO BE OPEN MINDED AND NOT ASSUME A PERSON'S INNOCENCE BY THEIR RACE OR GENDER

AND AS FAR AS CONAN POWER FANTASIES AND MALE GAZE GO WHAT A LOAD OF TURD YES MOST MEN WOULD LIKE TO BE WITH A GORGEOUS WOMAN BUT NOT EVERY GUY WOULD WANT TO BE CONAN WOMEN HAVE THEIR FANTASIES AS WELL YOU KNOW THOSE DISNEY MOVIES YOU KNOW THE ONE WHERE THE POOR GIRL ENDS UP BEING A PRINCESS AND LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITH HER PRINCE IS THIS NOT A FANTASY AS WELL THE GIRLS AND WOMEN THAT WATCH THESE MOVIES DO NOT IDENTIFY WITH CHARACTERS LIKE URSULA CRUELLY DE VIL OR THE QUEEN OF HEARTS THEY IDENTIFY WITH THE HEROINE WHO ALWAYS HAPPEN TO BE YOUNG ATTRACTIVE AND INNOCENT THEY LEARN FROM AN EARLY AGE THAT ATTRACTIVENESS GOOD AND UGLINESS BAD

AND HOW ABOUT THEM ROMANCE NOVELS PEOPLE LOVE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WOMEN ARE OBJECTIFIED BUT WHAT IS GOING ON HERE

UPLOADS

ONLY WOMEN CAN BE OBJECTIFIED THIS COVER DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A FACE IT'S SIMPLY A TORSO

IMAGES PHOTOS

THE STRANGEST THING IS THAT THESE PICTURES AREN'T ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM CONAN SO YOU HAVE THIS HUGE BACKLASH AGAINST CONAN AND HOW MEN LIKE SEEING SEXY WOMEN YET THE SAME PEOPLE SEEM TO IGNORE THAT MEN ARE BEING OBJECTIFIED IN NOVELS SUCH AS THESE WHERE THEY ARE IN SOME CASES WALKING TORSOS THE DOUBLE STANDARDS ARE REAL
DICE TOWER CAN WAX POETIC ON INCLUSIVENESS AND VIRTUE SIGNAL ALL THEY WANT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE MAIN PAID EMPLOYEES OF THE DICE TOWER ARE MEN THREE ARE IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA DURING EVERY MAIN REVIEW AND TOP LIST AND IS A FULL TIME EDITOR BEHIND THE SCENES PERSON GETTING MORE WOMEN AS BIT CONTRIBUTORS TO A ONCE A WEEK SHOW DOESN'T CHANGE THAT OF THE VIDEOS ON THE CHANNEL ARE ENTIRELY MALE IN CONTENT AND CONTRIBUTION
IF YOU GET A PANDEMIC GAME DEFINITELY GO FOR LEGACY YOU CAN PRACTICE ON THE PRISTINE BOARD A FEW TIMES BEFORE YOU JUMP IN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LEGACY LIKE THAT YOU'LL BE WASTING MONEY TO BUY THE VANILLA PANDEMIC GAME I WOULDN'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE DISEASE BIT FOR PANDEMIC YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP THE WORLD GET CURED THOUGH IF YOU WANT TO DO THE OPPOSITE THERE'S A PANDEMIC GAME FOR THAT TOO

IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER COUPLE TO PLAY WITH TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES IS ANOTHER GOOD ONE TO LOOK INTO YOU CAN DO IT WITH JUST TWO PEOPLE BUT IT'S NOT REALLY RECOMMENDED BY MOST PEOPLE

BEYOND THAT A LOT OF GAMES HAVE CAMPAIGNS THAT YOU CAN PLAY THROUGH MICE MYSTICS IS ONE THAT SEEMS TO GET GOOD REVIEWS THE D D BOARD GAMES ALSO SEEM TO HAVE CAMPAIGN SCENARIOS BUT THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH STORY TO THOSE DEAD OF WINTER IS PURE CO-OP IS BASICALLY MANDATORY AT AND POSSIBLE AT ANY PLAYER COUNT IF YOU LEAVE OUT THE SECRET OBJECTIVE CARDS ABOUT SURVIVING A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE AND THERE ARE A BUNCH OF MAIN OBJECTIVE CARDS TO PLAY THROUGH WITH FLAVOR STORY VARIANCE VIA THE CROSSROADS AND CRISIS DECKS LEGENDS OF ANDOR IS ANOTHER BUT IT'S MORE OF A PUZZLE TYPE GAME AND LESS RPG ADVENTURE AS IT LOOKS

IF YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES BASED ON HISTORY THERE IS BLACK ORCHESTRA WHERE YOU PLAY MEMBERS OF THE NAZI PARTY WHO PLOT TO ASSASSINATE HITLER OR FREEDOM THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD WHERE YOU TRAFFIC SLAVES INTO CANADA

OH YEAH A GREAT CO-OP NOT REALLY THOUGH IS BEYOND BAKER STREET IT'S LIKE HANAFI BUT IS SAID TO PLAY MUCH BETTER WITH 2 PLAYERS AND GOES UP TO PLAYERS AND IT HAS SOME THEME TO IT I LOVE IT AS A GAME AND THAT ALSO MAKES ME REMEMBER SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE IT DOESN'T GET MUCH MORE THAN WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A MAP NEWSPAPERS AND BOOKS AND IF YOU LIKE HOVERCRAFT THERE'S MYTHOS TALES WHICH IS THE SAME GAME STYLE WITH A CTHULHU THEME

SO MANY OPTIONS OUT THERE
OUT OF CURIOSITY WHY ARE YOU UNSURE ABOUT THE THEME OF PANDEMIC ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS ARE YOU SQUEAMISH ABOUT GERMS ARE YOU WORRIED THAT WE FOUND A CURE FOR A DISEASE WON'T FEEL AS EPIC AS WE SAVED THE WORLD FROM THE METEOR BECAUSE PANDEMIC LEGACY IS A GREAT GAME AND IT DOES FEEL EPIC BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND IF THE THEME ACTIVELY MAKES YOU FEEL ILL THAT YOU MAY NOT WANT TO PLAY IT

I HAVE HEARD THAT DEFENDERS OF THE REALM IS CLOSE TO BEING PANDEMIC WITH A HIGH FANTASY THEME BUT IS MAYBE NOT AS GOOD

GHOST STORIES IS A BRUTALLY UNFORGIVING CO-OP ABOUT BEING KUNG FU MONKS FIGHTING A DEMON LORD AND HIS ARMY OF GHOSTS

FORBIDDEN ISLAND AND FORBIDDEN DESERT ARE GAMES BY THE DESIGNER OF PANDEMIC THAT INVOLVE FINDING RELICS ON AN ISLAND IN THE DESERT AND THEN TRYING TO ESCAPE

SPEAKING OF WHICH ESCAPE THE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE IS A REAL-TIME DICE ROLLING CO-OP THAT HAS YOU PLAYING AS INDIANA CLONES SEE WHAT I DID THERE TRYING TO DO THE THING THAT IT SAYS IN THE NAME OF THE GAME IT HAS A COUPLE OF BIG EXPANSIONS AND A GAJILLION MINI EXPANSIONS IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE GAME UP

FLASH POINT FIRE RESCUE IS ABOUT BEING FIREMEN RUN INTO THE BUILDING TRY TO KEEP THE FIRE CONTAINED RESCUE THE DOG GET CAUGHT IN THE BLAST WHEN A GAS CANISTER EXPLODES IT HAS A GAJILLION MINI EXPANSIONS IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE GAME UP

OR IF YOU WANT TO TRY A GAME THAT'S ESSENTIALLY PANDEMIC BUT WITH A DIFFERENT THEME THERE'S PANDEMIC REIGN OF CTHULHU BECAUSE OF COURSE THERE IS

THOSE ARE THE MAIN ONES I CAN SUGGEST OR RECOMMEND MYSELF BESIDES HANAFI WHICH IS A BRAIN MELTER WITH A MOSTLY FORGETTABLE THEME
RACE TO THE RHINE IS A WW2 GAME ABOUT LOGISTICS AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
ODD CONSIDERATION A WAR THEMED GAME WITH NO CONFLICT I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE PROPOSE MAYBE CHECK OUT THE GRIZZLED
YOU MIGHT LIKE IMPERIAL IT IS A LITTLE BEFORE BUT IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE LEAD UP TO THAT WAR
BOARDGAME IMPERIAL

ALSO QUARTERMASTER GENERAL FOR WWII


SCYTHE IS A BIT HARD TO FIND AT THE MOMENT BUT IT FITS SOMEWHAT WITH WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THERE IS SOME PLAYER CONFLICT BUT IT'S NOT THE FOCUS OF THE GAME WHICH TENDS TO INVOLVE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND ENGINE BUILDING IT'S A BIT OF A STEAMPUNK FANTASY TAKE ON EASTERN EUROPE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING WWI OR SO SO IT'S NOT REALLY SET IN THE HISTORICAL WWI BUT IT MIGHT BE WORTH A LOOK

CITY OF SPIES ESTOIL HAS A WWII THEME AS IT'S SET IN PORTUGAL IN YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD UP A SPY ORGANIZATION FOR THE VARIOUS WORLD POWERS PLACING AGENTS AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE CITY IT'S MORE OF AN AREA CONTROL GAME THAN ONE WHICH DEALS WITH RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND ENGINE BUILDING BUT THERE IS A LIGHT MECHANIC WHICH YOU MIGHT FIND INTERESTING

POPULAR FRONT ISN'T ALL THAT WELL-KNOWN BUT IT'S A WARGAME WITH MECHANICS THERE IS DIRECT PLAYER CONFLICT IN THIS ONE THOUGH SO IT MIGHT NOT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT IT SEEMS TO FOCUS AS MUCH ON LOGISTICS AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE AS IT DOES ON TROOP MOVEMENT I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT IT'S GOTTEN SOME DECENT REVIEWS
I GUESS THINKING ABOUT IT SOMETHING LIKE NATIONS OR THROUGH THE AGES HAS WAR IN IT AND YOU HAVE TO MANAGE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT ARMIES AND STUFF BUT I GUESS I'M LOOKING FOR MORE GRANULAR ENGINE BUILDING AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
IN WINGS FOR THE BARON PLAYERS ARE GERMAN AIRPLANE MANUFACTURERS IN I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS
WW2
NO CONFLICT BETWEEN PLAYERS
WAT
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A GAME FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT SOUNDS PRETTY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT'S CALLED NO SOLDIER LEFT BEHIND HETP WHERE YOU PLAY INDIVIDUAL SOLDIERS TRYING TO COMPLETE MISSIONS DURING THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE

SEVERAL OF THE MISSIONS ARE ABOUT THINGS OTHER THAN JUST STRAIGHT-UP COMBAT FOR INSTANCE ONE SCENARIO HAS YOU PLAYING TWO MEDICS RUSHING THROUGH THE RUINS OF BASTOGNE TO SAVE WOUNDED SOLDIERS

IT'S GOT SOME MECHANICS IN IT LIKE A MODULAR BOARD AND LIGHT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY ENGINE BUILDING LIKE IN DOMINION AND GAMES LIKE THAT BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME STRATEGY ELEMENTS THAT MAKE IT HAVE A SIMILAR FLAVOR EACH SOLDIER HAS A DECK OF CARDS THAT YOU PULL FROM FOR SETTING YOUR AVAILABLE ACTIONS FOR INSTANCE

IT'S NOT AVAILABLE FOR SALE YET BUT HOPEFULLY SOON
COOL THANKS
WAIT FOR BLACK FRIDAY TARGET JUST HAD OFF ON THE AND I PICKED IT UP FOR FORTY IF IT IS STILL IN STOCK I BET THEY HAVE ANOTHER BLOW OUT SALE JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER

ETA ALSO MINIATURE MART ALWAYS HAS IT FOR ABOUT THE PRICE YOU LISTED THEY HAVE KEPT IT AT THAT PRICE FOR A LONG TIME WHILE EVERYONE ELSE RAISED THEIRS
IF YOU WANT NEW THAT SEEMS LIKE THE LOWEST PRICE I'VE SEEN ON THE OTHER HAND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO LIST MY COPY ON CRAIGSLIST ONLY PLAYED THROUGH ONCE UNFORTUNATELY I LET MY NEPHEWS PAINT THE MINIS BRIGHT SOLID COLORS SO SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE TURNED AWAY BY THAT PM ME IF YOU ARE INTERESTED
I'LL SALE YOU MINE IT'S BEEN BARELY PLAYED ONE TIME PM ME IF INTERESTED
I AM GUESSING YOU MEAN WHEN WILL THE NEXT PRINT RUN BE AS THIS GAME HAS NOT GONE OUT OF PRINT YET

THREAD


BELFORT SCOVILLE MANHATTAN PROJECT LEGACY THE TESTAMENT OF THE DUKE DECARCHY CASTLES OF THE MAD KING LUDWIG MEXICA MEDINA ABOVE AND BELOW
I RECENTLY GOT ABOVE AND BELOW AND WHILE I PLAYED IT ONLY TWICE I THINK IT FITS THE BILL AND EMET ON THE OTHER HAND HAVEN'T BEEN RECEIVED WELL BY SOME OF MY FRIENDS THEY SEEM TO ENJOY MODERATELY COMPLEX COOPERATIVE GAMES LIKE ELDRITCH HORROR AND DEAD OF WINTER

I TOO HAVE TEACHED CONCORDIA TO A LOT OF PEOPLE NEW TO MODERN BOARDGAMES WITH GREAT SUCCESS AS WELL AS AGRICOLA AND POWER GRID WITH AGRICOLA YOU CAN JUST LEAVE OUT THE CARDS AND EXPLAIN THE BASICS AND GO ON AS YOU'RE PLAYING WITH POWER GRID EVERYONE GETS IT AFTER THE FIRST ROUND
ALSO MY NEWEST PURCHASE BRUGES WAS VERY EASY TO TEACH TO MY SO LAST WEEK AND THEN THERE'S ALWAYS CLASSICS LIKE BONANZA AND OTHER SMALL CARD GAMES
ABYSS IS A GREAT GAME WHICH I FIND PRETTY EASY TO TEACH I RECENTLY TAUGHT IT TO MY GRANDMOTHER WHO USUALLY DOESN'T PLAY ANYTHING HEAVIER THAN TICKET TO RIDE AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE LEARNING IT
FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE IS REALLY EASY TO TEACH BUT SO HARD TO MASTER

CAPTAIN SONAR

CHINATOWN

SCYTHE

LORDS OF VEGAS

MYSTERIUM

QUANTUM

SUBURBIA
I LITERALLY WAS LOOKING UP THIS EXACT THING THE OTHER DAY SO I JUST SO HAPPEN TO HAVE ALL OF MY LINKS STILL OPEN

START HERE

THEN USE THIS SITE

GOOD LUCK
FOR

UNTIL DEC THEY HAVE A FOR SALE WITH FREE SHIPPING INCLUDES DECK OF CARDS AS LONG AS THEY HAVE THE SAME BACK IF YOU DONT NEED THAT MANY MIGHT AS WELL ORDER EXTRA FOR SPARES SINCE THEY ARE NOT THE MOST HIGH QUALITY DECKS

THERE IS ALSO PRINTERSTUDIO WILL COST A LITTLE MORE BUT CAN GET BETTER QUALITY CARDS
EVERYONE IS GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION ABOUT LACERNA GAMES HIS GAMES ARE ALL BIG HEAVY EUROS BUT DIFFERENT MECHANICS AND LAYOUTS MEAN CERTAIN GAMERS PREFER DIFFERENT TITLES

PERSONALLY I'M A BIG FAN OF ALL OF THEM BUT THEN I'M A SUPER EASY PERSON WHO KIND OF LIKES EVERYTHING SO HERE'S A QUICK RUN DOWN FOR YOU TO MAKE A DECISION

ALLERGIST THIS IS JUST SIMPLY STUNNING IT'S HONESTLY WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST GORGEOUS GAME TO LOOK AT AND THE COMPONENT QUALITY IS SECOND TO NONE THE GAME ITSELF IS A LITTLE FIDDLY WITH LOTS OF LITTLE RULES IT'S FAIRLY HARD TO TEACH BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT THERE ARE ONLY ACTION SPACES THE SCORE TRACK IS A PHENOMENAL MECHANIC WHICH TRACKS THREE THINGS WITH ONE TOKEN AND YOU CAN SPEND POINTS TO GET MORE ACTIONS IT REALLY IS A MARVEL THE OVERALL GAME IS GREAT BUT I FEEL LIKE THE VICTORY ONLY COMES DOWN TO ONE TRACK TO GET THERE IE BUY MORE ART SEND MORE ASSISTANTS TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET

KANKAN JESUS JUST LOOK AT THAT BOARD IT LITERALLY FUCKS YOUR EYES THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE IT BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A GENIUS DESIGN ALL THE ACTION SPACES ARE IN A LINE YOU MOVE ALONG IT AND SO DOES SHARON IT'S SO GOOD FOR BRAIN CRUNCHING WORKING OUT WHERE TO GO TO BEAT YOUR OPPONENTS OR SHARON AND THEN EVERY SECTION OF THE BOARD IS LINKED TO THE ACTION LINE AND TO EACH OTHER YOU CAN FOLLOW THE PRODUCTION OF THE CAR REALLY WELL THE GAME ITSELF IS HEAVY IT'S A BRAIN MELTER ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BUT GOD IS IT CONFUSING AT FIRST I FEEL THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO VICTORY HERE

VINOS IF YOU GET THE NEW DELUXE VERSION IT IS GORGEOUS AGAIN IT'S HEAVY MANUAL IT HAS A SHIPLOAD OF RULES BUT ONCE YOU GET YOUR HEAD ROUND THE ACTIONS SPACES THEN IT ALL KIND OF COMES TOGETHER YEAH IT'S HARD TO TEACH IT'S ALSO A PRETTY HARD TO MASTER GAME TOO YOU ARE JUGGLING BALLS ALL OVER THE DAMN SHOP AND YOUR DECISIONS REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT EACH TURN BUT IT'S SO REWARDING WHEN YOU GET IT RIGHT

CONCLUSION BUY THEM ALL I HONESTLY COULDN'T PUT ONE BETTER THAN THE OTHER THEY ARE ALL GREAT GAMES AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME THAT I HAVE SAID NO TO ANY OF THEM OVER THE OTHERS

EDIT ACTUALLY AFTER READING THAT IT ISN'T VERY HELPFUL SORRY THEY ARE ALL JUST REALLY GOOD SO IF I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO PICK ONE THEN I WOULD PROBABLY GO FOR ALLERGIST IT'S SO STUNNING THAT IT PIPS THE OTHERS JUST SO SLIGHTLY
DON'T FORGET ABOUT IF YOU LIKE GAMES
I THINK IF YOU COULD HAVE ONLY ONE I WOULD GO FOR THE ALLERGIST IT'S A BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ART WITH A LOT OF DEPTH WHILE BEING ONE OF LACERNA SIMPLE GAMES I THINK IT'S A NICE INTRODUCTION TO HIS OTHER GAMES

EDIT I JUST DON'T OWN BC THERE'S RUMOR OF A REPRINT IN BUT I PLAYED THEM ALL
I HAVEN'T YET PLAYED VINOS BUT BETWEEN KANKAN AND THE ALLERGIST I WOULD GIVE A SLIGHT EDGE TO KANKAN IT'S A LITTLE TIGHTER AND MORE COMPETITIVE AND THE SLEW OF DIFFERENT GOALS AND MILESTONES GIVES THE GAME GOOD VARIABILITY I THINK IT ALSO SCALES BETTER IT PLAYS RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND IS GOOD WITH MORE PLAYERS WITHOUT BLOATING IN PLAYTIME WHILE I THINK THE ALLERGIST WOULD DRAG TOO MUCH WITH PLAYERS THE ALLERGIST IS ALSO EXCELLENT AND THE BUMPING AND BOOSTING FAME OF ARTISTS GIVE THE GAME SOME NICE INTERACTION SO IT FEELS LESS CONFRONTATIONAL
I SIMPLY ADORE THE ALLERGIST WITH THAT SAID I HAVE NOT PLAYED ANY OF HIS OTHERS BUT I AM ALSO INTRIGUED BY LISBOA
PLAYED LAST WEEKEND AND IT WAS A FUN GAME ENJOYED THE THEME AND ITS TYPICAL VITAL
I HAVE AGRICOLA AND FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE BOTH LOVE THEM AND I WENT WITH THE ALLERGIST AS MY FIRST LACERNA GAME IT'S GORGEOUS THE THEME IS UNLIKE ANYTHING I'VE SEEN IN A BOARD GAME AND IT'S A REAL BRAIN BURNER ALSO IT'S READILY AVAILABLE COULDN'T GO WRONG IN MY OPINION
SOLD THE ALLERGIST NOT TOO LONG AGO IT WASN'T A BIG WITH MY SO AND WHILE I ENJOYED IT IT DIDN'T LEAVE A HUGE IMPACT COMPARED TO THE TIME IT TAUGHT TO PLAY AND SET UP

NOW WE HAVE VINOS DELUXE I LOVE THIS GAME IT'S SO RICH AND DEEP WITH SO MANY FUN AND COOL DECISIONS TO MAKE THE ART IS GORGEOUS TRUE FOR THE ALLERGIST AS WELL IT'S JUST A LOT OF FUN TO PLAY EVEN IF THE RULES CAN BE A BIT DAUNTING AT FIRST HOWEVER I ACTUALLY THINK THE RULES WERE EASIER TO DIGEST THAN FOR THE ALLERGIST
OBVIOUSLY AS A BOARD GAMER MY ORIGINAL CONCLUSION WAS TO BUY THEM ALL

THEN REALITY AND KNOWING MY WIFE'S LIKELY REACTION TO THE SIZE OF THE PARCEL AND OUTLAY MADE ME REALISE ONE WOULD HAVE TO DO

THANKS FOR THE ADVICE SO FAR
I HAVE PLAYED VINOS DELUXE THE ALLERGIST AND LISBOA ALL ON TABLETOPIA AND I CAN INVITE PEOPLE TO GAMES IF THEY WANT TO FIGURE OUT THIS DECISION BY TRYING OUT THE GAMES THEMSELVES AND I THINK LISBOA MIGHT JUST BE ONE OF THE BEST BOARD GAMES I HAVE PLAYED UNIQUE BOARD GAMES PLAYED FOR SCALE IT QUICKLY HIT MY TOP I THINK THAT DESCRIPTION OF THIS GAME AS A SANDBOX IS NOT QUITE ACCURATE WHEN I THINK OF SANDBOX GAMES I THINK OF GAMES THAT LET YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH VERY LITTLE DIRECTION WHEREAS IN THIS GAME YOU REALLY NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN EVERY ASPECT OF THE GAME TO PERFORM WELL ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BOARD AND ALL THE MECHANISMS WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A REALLY COHESIVE EXPERIENCE UNLIKE MANY OTHER GAMES I HAVE PLAYED I THINK VINOS IS INTERESTING ALTHOUGH ONCE YOU GET OVER THE BEAUTY OF THE DELUXE BOARD AND THE SIMPLE BEAUTY OF THE ACTION SELECTION THE GAME CAN GET A LITTLE DRY THE ALLERGIST IS ACTUALLY MY LEAST FAVORITE SO FAR OF GAMES THE TURN STRUCTURE IS VERY SIMPLE WHICH IS REFRESHING BUT I FOUND THE MECHANISMS TO BE FAIRLY UNINTUITIVE LEAVING ME WITH ALMOST NO IDEA WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING ALSO AT THE END OF THE GAME THE ONLY IMPACT YOU'VE REALLY MADE IS RAISED THE RENOWN OF ARTISTS BY MOVING UP DIFFERENT TRACKS WHEREAS IN LISBOA YOU ARE REBUILDING A WHOLE CITY FROM RUIN AND HELPING THE ECONOMY TO GROW BY GETTING INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE AND HELPING THE GOVERNMENT TO REBUILD AS WELL ALL INSIDE OF A PLAY A CARD DRAW A CARD TURN STRUCTURE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD GET LISBOA BUT KEEP IN MIND ALL OF THIS IS MY OPINION AND I KNOW MANY WILL DISAGREE ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE ALLERGIST MAYBE I NEED AT LEAST MORE PLAYS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND
GOLFDOM GOOD OLD FASHIONED DECK OF CARDS
I HAVE JUST EXTENSION THE FIRST ONE WHICH INCLUDES JUMPS OVERPASS AS WELL AS DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS FOR GUARD RAILS I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE OTHERS BUT IT IMMENSELY IMPROVES THE GAME HAVING IT
WITS AND WAGERS SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD FIT FOR HIM AS WELL EDIT OH AND PROBABLY TELESTRATIONS
SPYFAULT SNAKE OIL CODENAMES MYSTERIUM THE RESISTANCE

JUST A FEW THOUGHTS
FOR A GAME THAT IN TOM HASSELS OPINION IS BETTER THAN MYSTERIUM YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG

IT'S A DEDUCTION GAME WHERE YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY A MURDERER THE GAME IS SIMILAR TO MYSTERIUM WHERE A GHOST HANDS OUT CLUES IN DECEPTION A FORENSICS INVESTIGATOR HANDS OUT CLUES IN A SIMILAR MECHANISM
HONESTLY I WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY IF I WERE YOU NOT BECAUSE OF THE MATURE CONTENT BUT BECAUSE IT'S A STEP-DOWN IN MY OPINION FROM WHAT HE ALREADY LIKES SAY ANYTHING FOR EXAMPLE IS FAR SUPERIOR UNLESS YOU PLAY WITH UNFUNNY PEOPLE IN THAT CASE MAYBE WE COULD BUILD A CASE FOR CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY IF YOU EVER WANT TO GET A GAME ABOUT CRUDE HUMOR I WOULD RECOMMEND JOKING HAZARD IT'S ALWAYS A MATTER OF TASTE BUT THAT LAST ONE ALWAYS GIVES ME A LAUGH

AS FOR RECOMMENDATIONS I HAVE A FEW BUT THEY'RE NOT ALL THAT SIMILAR

SPYFAULT IS THE FIRST THAT POPS IN MIND IT'S A GAME IN WHICH EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME LOCATION CARD BUT ONE PERSON GETS A SPY CARD THEN EVERYBODY ASKS EACH OTHER QUESTIONS TO FIND OUT WHO THE SPY IS

LIN IS SIMILAR IN WHICH TO SPIES AROUND THE TABLE GET A SECRET PASSWORD AND THEY HAVE TO FIND EACH OTHER OUT BY SAYING WORDS RELATED TO IT IT'S A BIT WEIRD BUT IT WORKS WITH THE RIGHT GROUP

CODENAMES IS A COOL GAME ABOUT WORD ASSOCIATION IT'S BEEN HIGHLY POPULAR FOR THE LAST YEAR

GUESS THE MESS IS ANOTHER WEIRD GAME THE CLOSEST COMPARISON I CAN MAKE IS WITH DIXIT EACH PLAYER GETS A SECRET LOCATION AND PLAYERS SEARCH IN A PILE OF PHOTOS TO FIND PICTURES THAT REPRESENT THEIR LOCATION THE BEST THEN YOU NEED TO GUESS SOMEONE LOCATION BASED ON THEIR PHOTOS

THE RESISTANCE AVALON IS A GAME IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE A GROUP OF LOYAL KNIGHTS BUT TRAITORS ARE AROUND THE TABLE TRAITORS TRY TO SABOTAGE QUESTS KNIGHTS TRY TO SUCCEED THEM IT DEFINITELY MORE COMPLEX THAN THE OTHER GAMES I MENTIONED BUT IT'S STILL VERY ACCESSIBLE

THEY'RE ALL ON THE AND A BIT IF ANY OF THEM SOUND INTERESTING YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO IT MAYBE IT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
THINGS
MYSTERIUM GETS RECOMMENDED A LOT AS THE GAME THAT DIXIT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALSO RECOMMEND CODENAMES IF HE LIKES FLUX THEN HE'D PROBABLY LIKE SUSHI GO RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD CARD DRAFTING SET COLLECTION AND MAYBE DOMINION DECK BUILDING LOVE LETTER AS WELL OR ONE OF ITS MANY VARIANTS SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM I BELIEVE HAS BLUFFING ETC HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT IT'S RECOMMENDED A LOT AS WELL
A FAKE ARTIST GOES TO NEW YORK

EVERYONE EXCEPT ONE PERSON IS GIVEN THE SAME WORD THAT THEY HAVE TO DRAW EACH PLAYER GETS A DIFFERENT COLORED MARKER YOU TAKE TURNS ADDING ONE LINE AT A TIME TO THE DRAWING THE ONE PERSON WHO DID NOT GET THE WORD IS THE FAKE ARTIST AND HAS TO PRETEND THEY KNOW THE WORD AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROUP DRAWING AFTER TWO ROUNDS EVERYONE HAS TO GUESS WHO THE FAKE ARTIST WAS

YOU CAN EASILY PLAY THIS WITH SLIPS OF PAPER TO WRITE THE DRAWING SUBJECT ON A SKETCH PAD AND A SET OF MARKERS COLORED PENCILS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY THE ACTUAL GAME
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF IS PROBABLY THE BEST TYPE OF THAT GAME THAT MY FRIENDS AND I PLAY YOU DO NEED A MODERATOR BUT IF YOU HAVE A THEN THERE IS A FREE APP THAT DOES THE WORK FOR YOU

SPYFAULT TWO ROOMS AND A BOOM RESISTANCE ARE ALSO GOOD OPTIONS TWO ROOMS NEEDS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THOUGH
FOR CREATIVE GAMES I WOULD RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICALLY AS REPLACEMENTS FOR APPLES TO APPLES AND CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY

SNAKE OIL PICK TWO CARDS TO CREATE A NEW PRODUCT THAT YOU MUST PITCH TO A CUSTOMER THE JUDGE
SUPERTIGHT YOU MUST ARGUE WHY YOUR CHARACTER IS MORE AWESOME THAN ANYONE A GOOD EXAMPLE FROM A REVIEW YOU COULD ARGUE THAT A SOCCER MOM WHO THROWS BEARS AND THINKS THE FLOOR IS ACTUALLY LAVA IS BETTER THAN A VEGAN WHO CAN'T STOP DANCING AND SUMMONS CATS TO DO THEIR BIDDING
UNEMPLOYED IS JUST LIKE SNAKE OIL BUT IT IS LIKELY TOO MATURE WITHOUT REMOVING ANY CARDS UNCONTROLLABLE LIBIDO AND CONDOMS ARE DEFINITELY IN THE GAME I ONLY MENTION THIS ONE BECAUSE I PREFER THE PREMISE TO SNAKE OIL YOU'RE INTERVIEWING FOR A JOB AND YOU HAVE TO INCORPORATE THE TRAITS OBJECTS ON THE CARDS IN YOUR HAND TO APPEAL TO THE INTERVIEWER AND SHOW THAT YOU'RE THE MOST QUALIFIED
ONCE UPON A TIME ALL CREATIVE NO FILLER
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF
SPYFAULT
THE RESISTANCE
SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT
CODENAMES

WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATIONS
LOOKING AT IT I SEE A BUNCH OF BACKERS COMMENTING THE GOT THEIR BOARDS LIKE 2 YEARS AGO SO IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THIS WAS A SCAM IT MAY JUST BE AFTER THE INITIAL SHIPMENT THE COMPANY FOUND IT WASNT PROFITABLE OR THERE WASN'T THE INTEREST IN SUCH A NICHE BROADEST TO CONTINUE

I DON'T IMAGINE IT WOULD BE TO HARD FOR SOMEONE TO CREATE A CUSTOM RISK MAP WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE GAME CRAFTER AND A BIT OF ARTISTIC TALENT
IN REPLY TO THE ABOVE YOU ONLY NEED ARTISTIC SKILL LET AMAZON HANDLE THE BOARD

DP
YOU ARE MISSING DOMINION SEASIDE WHICH IS COOL FIVE TRIBES MIGHT BE GOOD IF YOU LIKE EUROGAMES I'VE SEEN PEOPLE RECOMMEND CASTLES OF BURGUNDY FOR AND UP TOO I ONLY BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY SO CAN'T GIVE MY OWN OPINION YET

STAR REALMS IS ANOTHER ASCENSION DOMINION LIKE DRAFTING GAME AND QUITE CHEAP TO PICK UP

SOMETHING YOU MIGHT TRY IS ARBORETUM IT'S NICE AT 2 AND PLAYERS


NOTE I ALWAYS HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING GAMES THAT ARE GOOD AT 2 AND AT THAT'S WHY I AM NOT RECOMMENDING ANYTHING IN THOSE RANGES MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE HAS SOMETHING
I WOULD SUGGEST MANSIONS OF MADNESS OR THE MARKHAM HORROR CG FOR CARD GAMES IF YOU LIKE DOMINION MAYBE YOU WOULD LIKE TANTO CHORE WHICH SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER A BETTER IMPLEMENTATION OF MECHANICS
MAYBE TRY OUT A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME SUCH AS LORDS OF WATERDEEP STONE AGE OR VITICULTURE ESSENTIAL EDITION

WHICH OF YOUR GAMES ARE ARE FAVORITES
IT WOULD HELP TO KNOW WHAT YOU DO AND DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE GAMES TO REALLY OFFER GREAT SUGGESTIONS ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SIMILAR MORE LESS COMPLEX ETC

IF YOU LIKE THE MARKHAM BETRAYAL THEMES AND CO-OP ASPECTS I WOULD SUGGEST MANSIONS OF MADNESS 2ND EDITION

IF YOU LIKE DECK ENGINE BUILDER GAMES I WOULD SUGGEST SOMETHING LIKE SPLENDOR OR PUZZLE FIGHTER TO MIX IT UP

IF YOU LIKE THE WORKER PLACEMENT CONSTRUCTION TRY MANHATTAN PROJECT OR NEW YORK
I'M PERSONALLY A BIG FAN OF SCOVILLE IT'S AN AREA CONTROL GAME BUT YOU ARE BUILDING THE AREA AS YOU GO IT HAS A VARIABLE PLAYER TURN ORDER SO GOING FIRST ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST OPTION FOR YOU ADDING STRATEGY BIGGEST CON IS THAT IT IS COLOR BASED SO HOPEFULLY NO ONE YOU PLAY WITH IS COLOR BLIND OR IT BECOMES A TOUCH DIFFICULT THERE IS ALSO AN INSTRUCTIONAL WATCH IT PLAYED VIDEO THAT ALWAYS MAKES TEACHING EASY IF YOU ARE INCAPABLE YOURSELF

POWER GRID WOULD BE THE OTHER GAME I WOULD RECOMMEND IT'S JUST FANTASTIC ALL THE WAY AROUND SUCH A GOOD GAME
I HAVE SEEN LISTINGS ON AMAZON BUT THEY ARE
SOME PEOPLE AT R CARDSAGAINSTHUMANITY HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT IT I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT IS OR ISN'T INSIDE OF IT
I WAS SERIOUSLY THINKING ABOUT IT THEN I WENT TO ADD IT TO CART AND IT'S ONLY IN THE US I'M CANADIAN
THAT'S A LONG CARD BOX
I RECOMMEND REMOVING EXPANSIONS FROM YOUR LIST BEFORE UPLOADING DOING THAT NOW TO SAVE TIME IT'S TEDIOUS FOR ME TO RANK ALL MY ARMADA EXPANSIONS

UPDATE JUST BEEN USING IT AND SCREWED UP SELECTED A WRONG GAME CHOICE THIS NEEDS AN UNDO OR A BACK BUTTON OR SOMETHING
MADE IT ABOUT OF THE WAY THROUGH BEFORE STOPPING IT STARTED TO BE TOO MUCH OF A COIN FLIP BETWEEN GAMES AND SUBJECTIVE BASED ON MOOD THERE ARE DEFINITELY GAMES THAT WOULD BE RATED HIGHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE ON MY LIST BUT THERE'S THAT THAT COULD GO EITHER WAY
THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE TOOL WELL DONE

IT NAILED MY TOP GAMES PRETTY ACCURATELY OBVIOUSLY THESE GAMES WILL BE IN FLUX DEPENDING ON MY MOOD BUT NONE THE LESS THESE ARE DEFINITELY MY TOP GAMES

IS THERE A WAY TO IMPORT ALL MY RATED GAMES FROM BG THAT I SCORED AND UP I DON'T WANNA TYPE THEM ALL

THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST IS WHAT WILL BE MOST USEFUL TO ME IT'LL ALLOW ME TO EASILY IDENTIFY GAMES THAT CAN BE PURGED WE'VE GOT A BIG COLLECTION AND NOW I CAN LOOK AT A LIST LIKE THIS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT MY SALE TRADE FODDER WILL BE OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO
NICE ONE THIS IS THE ONE THING I'VE LET SLIDE I DON'T RANK ANY OF MY GAMES WHICH MEANS I CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME WEB APPS THAT RECOMMEND OTHER GAMES THANKS
NICE SITE LOVE THE FOAMCORE STUFF
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF POSTS SAYING THAT THEY FOUND THE PROCESS TEDIOUS I AGREE BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME POTENTIALLY I'M NOT A PROGRAMMER EASY FIXES
HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAVE AN ACCOUNT THAT WAY YOU CAN JUST DO A FEW MATCHUPS AS A AND IT COULD SAVE AND COMPILE YOUR RESULTS
FOR ME HAVING ALL PROMOS AND EXPANSIONS INCLUDED WAS A PAIN FOR EACH ITEM PERHAPS A TRASH OPTION COULD BE PLACED UNDER EACH GAME CLICK THAT AND THAT ITEM WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE RANKINGS THIS COULD ALSO TAKE OUT THE GAMES THAT I HAVE LISTED ON MY BG BUT ARE MY KIDS GAMES
I LOVE IT RANKED ALL GAMES I'VE PLAYED
ISN'T ANYONE GOING TO MENTION THAT IT'S JUST QUICKSORT OR THAT TOM ASEL RECENTLY MENTIONED THIS IN HIS TOP NEAT IMPLEMENTATION BTW
I WRITE A LOT OF COMMENTS FOR MY GAMES ON BG AND THEY ALL GET ADDED TO THE LIST IS THERE A WAY TO DOWNLOAD MY COLLECTION WITH ONLY THE NAMES OF THE GAMES SHOWING

I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D DO THIS OTHER THAN WASTE TIME IT'S VERY IT DOESN'T TAKE YOUR RATINGS INTO ACCOUNT AND FIGURING OUT YOUR TOP X GAMES DEPENDS ON YOUR MOOD AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
IN OTHER NEWS SOME PEOPLE LIKE CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM WHILE OTHERS PREFER VANILLA WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS CRISIS AT
IT'S ABSOLUTELY NORMAL WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES IT WOULD BE A DULL WORLD IF WE ALL LIKED THE SAME THINGS PANDEMIC LEGACY TERRA MYSTIC AND EMET ARE IN MY PERSONAL TOP
I'M SURE I CAN'T STAND A GAME YOU LIKE
TO BE FAIR I PERSONALLY NEVER APPRECIATE THESE TYPES OF THREADS THEY HAVE A NEGATIVE ANGLE ON THE HOBBY YOU CAN'T BE RIGHT OR WRONG ABOUT OPINIONS



YOU ARE DEFINITELY NOT INSANE FOR NOT LIKING TERRA MYSTIC NOR AM I INSANE FOR LIKING IT SO MUCH I PUT IT IN MY FLAIR



NOW IF YOU ARE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING RATHER THAN HEARING YOUR DISLIKE FOR THESE GAMES CONFIRMED BY SOME LET'S DO IT FROM YOUR TOP I DEDUCE THAT YOU LIKE CONFLICT HEAVY GAMES SO I CAN ALREADY TELL YOU THAT MOST OF THE ENTRIES IN THE TOP WITH THE CATEGORY ECONOMIC WILL NOT BE TO YOUR LIKING SOME MAY BE BUT MOST ARE ABOUT ENGINE OPTIMIZATION WITHOUT CONFLICT CATEGORIES FIGHTING AND WARGAMES ON THE OTHER HAND YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF ENJOYING



THE FACT THAT REVIEWERS YOU RESPECT SOMETIMES RECOMMEND A GAME YOU DON'T LIKE MIGHT BE BECAUSE THEY ENJOY BOTH EUROGAMES AND CONFLICT GAMES
2 COME TO MIND FOR ME
WONDERS I FIND IT BORING BUT OTHERS SEEM TO LOVE IT JUST DON'T REALLY ENJOY THE CHOICES THERE ARE TOO MAKE AND IT FEELS OVER COMPLICATED IN SOME WAYS LIKE THE SCIENCE VP WOULD MUCH RATHER PLAYER THE SIMPLER AND MORE VISUALLY APPEALING SUSHI GO

I KNOW IT'S NOT IN THE TOP BUT ALSO FEEL LIKE THIS ABOUT CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY NOW NOT BECAUSE I'M OFFENDED BY IT BUT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'VE GROWN OUT OF IT AND THE JOKES FEEL VERY DIMENSIONAL WOULD MUCH RATHER PLAY SNAKE OIL UNEMPLOYED OR MONIKERS
THERE ARE GAMES IN THE TOP THAT I LOVE AND GAMES IN THE TOP THAT I VERY MUCH DON'T LIKE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN YOU'LL EXPERIENCE THE SAME THING WITH TOP MOVIE LIST AND ANYTHING SIMILAR
DEPENDS
I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE BIG BLOODY VIDEO GAME THEMES INVADING MY BOARDGAME SPACES BUT APPARENTLY EVERYONE ELSE IS FULLY ON BOARD WITH IT SO I TRY TO GAME AROUND IT
I CERTAINLY DON'T HATE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE POPULAR BUT I DO DISLIKE GAMES THAT HAPPEN TO BE POPULAR

WONDERS SPLENDOR AND SUSHI GO ARE THE MAIN ONES ALSO BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL BUT MY FRIENDS LOVE THAT SO I HAVE FUN WITH IT ANYWAY
I JUST GET SICK OF LOTS OF HYPE FOR THINGS THAT AREN'T RELEASED YET SCYTHE SEAWALL ANIS ETC NOT THAT I HATE THE GAMES WHEN THEY ACTUALLY EXIST TO BE BOUGHT AND PLAYED BUT THE OH THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING SONG AND DANCE MAKES ME PREDISPOSED TO NOT LIKE THE GAMES
OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE ENTITLED TO YOUR OPINION AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT BUT I WONDER WHETHER YOU HAVE ACTUALLY WON A GAME OF EMET I AM JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE YOUR EXPERIENCES DO NOT REFLECT MINE OR THAT OF PEOPLE I PLAY IT WITH AT ALL I WILL CONCEDE THAT TURN ORDER IS PRETTY IMPORTANT BUT YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT I EAST I COULD TAKE THIS TEMPLE TO GET A TEMPORARY VICTORY POINT BUT THAT WON'T HELP ME AS MUCH AS SETTING TURN ORDER NEXT TURN ALTHOUGH I WOULD BE MISSING OUT ON TWO OR THREE PRAYER POINTS BY DOING THAT STILL REGARDLESS OF YOUR PLACE IN THE TURN ORDER WHERE YOU END UP SHOULD HELP DETERMINE YOUR STRATEGY FOR THAT DAY IF YOU GO EARLY ITS A GOOD DAY TO BUY A TILE YOU NEED IF YOU GO LATE ITS A GOOD DAY TO BUILD UP FOR AN ATTACK OR TWO TO TRY AND GET SOME POINTS THE TILES THEMSELVES ARE A FREE FOR ALL BUT YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHAT SOMEONE ELSE CAN BUY OR NOT BY LOOKING AT THEIR PYRAMIDS AND IT FORCES YOU TO BE FLEXIBLE SOMEONE ELSE SNAGGED GODSPEED THEN YOU SHOULD LOOK AT STARGATE AND OR THE BEETLE COMBAT IS BRILLIANT IN MY OPINION GENERALLY I PREFER TO ATTACK PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH A FEW BATTLES BECAUSE IF I HAVE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION I WILL KNOW WHAT CARDS THEY HAVE PLAYED SO FAR AND AT THE VERY LEAST I WILL HAVE MORE CHOICES THEN THEY DO UNTIL THEIR HAND RESETS DI CARDS ARE GENERALLY NOT THAT IMPACT IN OUR GAMES I BELIEVE YOU CAN ONLY PLAY PER BATTLE ARE YOU FOLLOWING THAT RULE ALSO TURTLING IS PRETTY MUCH NEVER A GOOD IDEA IN EMET AND IT IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO GET POINTS THE GAME IS ALL ABOUT ATTACKING I HAVE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE WIN BY STAYING IN THEIR CITY

ANYWAYS WE LOVE EMET I THINK IT IS THE BEST IN ITS CLASS OF GAME DETERMINISTIC AREA CONTROL BUT YOUR OPINION IS JUST AS VALID AS MINE OBVIOUSLY AND IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU THAN SOME RANDOM INTERNET PERSON ALSO HAVE YOU TRIED IT WITH THE EXPANSION IT ADDRESSES A LOT OF THE ISSUES YOU MIGHT HAVE WITH THE GAME
I GO TO A GAME CLUB MOST WEEKS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY LOVE EPIC SPELL WARS OF THE BATTLE WIZARDS DUEL AT MOUNT SKULLZFYRE I PLAYED IT ONCE AND I SIMPLY CAN'T STAND IT I DON'T LIKE THE GAME PLAY THE ART THE RESOLUTION IT HAPPENS TO ALL OF US I BROUGHT WONDERS ONE OF MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITES ONE WEEK AND SOMEONE WAS LIKE UGH I HATE THAT GAME THAT'S WHY I GO TO A CLUB WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE SO THAT EVERYONE CAN FIND SOMETHING TO SUIT THEIR TASTES
EDIT TYPOS
I HATE SOCCER WHICH IS SUPER POPULAR HERE IN GERMANY
YES BACK WHEN I WAS BEGINNING TO COLLECT I SAW THAT EVERYONE HAD POSTED KING OF TOKYO ON THEIR TOP AND IT RATED SUPER HIGH ON BG

I GOT IT WITHOUT DIGGING TOO MUCH INTO GAME MECHANICS I PLAYED IT ONCE AND I WAS LIKE THERE HAS TO BE MORE TO THE GAME RIGHT BUT NOPE DICE CHUCKING AND THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH IT

THAT'S WHEN I LEARNED TO DO LOTS OF RESEARCH BEFORE EACH PURCHASE I STILL RUN INTO TIMES WHEN I THINK A GAME WILL BE FUN AND THEN ACTUAL PLAYING IS NOT BUT MUCH FEWER AND FARTHER IN BETWEEN I WISH I HAD TH TIME AND PROXIMITY TO GO TO A GAMING STORE TO TRY GAMES IN PERSON BEFORE BUYING MORE OFTEN
IF YOU MEAN DO I HATE RECENT BREAKOUT GAMES BECAUSE I WANT TO FEEL SUPER ORIGINAL THEN NUMBER BUT I THINK I PLAY WITH SOME PEOPLE WHO DO

IF YOU MEAN DOES PART OF ME HATE DECENT OCCASIONALLY FUN GAMES BECAUSE PEOPLE SOMEHOW KEEP CALLING THEM THE BEST EVER THEN I MUST PLEAD GUILTY IF I'M NOT PLAYING A GREAT GAME I'D RATHER PLAY AN UNDERDOG GAME THAT'S EQUALLY OKAY INSTEAD OF REINFORCING SOME UNDESERVED TOP TITLE
I HATE THAT NEW SUPER POPULAR HYPE GAMES OVERSHADOW OLDER GAMES THAT ARE MUCH BETTER YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BARELY PLAYED ANY GAMES FROM GENRE X SAYING THAT GAME Y IS AN AMAZING MUST HAVE SHOOT TO THE TOP OF BG WHICH IN THE END RESULTS IN A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENT FOR LONGTIME GAMERS
YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO LIKE EVERYTHING NO MATTER WHERE IT IS ON A TOP LIST

IF YOU'RE HATING A GAME JUST BECAUSE ITS POPULAR WELL THATS PRETTY DUMB

ALSO TURTLING IS THE WORST WAY TO PLAY EMET SO YOU MIGHT BE APPROACHING THAT THE WRONG WAY

THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF GAME FOR ME IS ITS THEME AND HOW IT IS TRANSLATED TO INTERESTING MECHANIC SO I FIND TERRA MYSTIC TO BE UNINTERESTING DESPITE ITS POPULARITY I NEVER THINK EITHER ME OR PEOPLE WHO LOVE TERRA MYSTIC IS WRONG THOUGH IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DIFFERENT TASTE


OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME GAMES YOU WON'T LIKE IN A SELECTION OF GAMES THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE ANYONE WHO LIKES ALL OF THEM
I FIND NOTHING WEIRD ABOUT DIFFERENT TASTES FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE BUT I DO THINK IT'S WEIRD YOU SAID YOU TURTLE IN EMET YOU BASICALLY ONLY SCORE POINTS FOR ATTACKING AND CAN FIELD A TON OF ARMY SUPER EASILY WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR GAMES WHERE PEOPLE ARE TURTLING
ALSO PHRASED AS ARE YOU A BOARD GAME HIPSTER

I DON'T HATE SUPER POPULAR GAMES I ENJOYED MUNCHKIN THE FIRST FEW TIMES I PLAYED IT SAME WITH CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY AND EXPLODING KITTENS I HAVE NO REAL DESIRE TO PLAY ANY OF THEM AGAIN BUT IF THE MOOD IS RIGHT AND WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE I PROBABLY WOULD SIMILARLY WITH CATAN AND TICKET TO RIDE I'VE ENJOYED THEM AND I'D PLAY THEM AGAIN WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE BUT GIVEN A CHOICE I'D RATHER PLAY SOMETHING ELSE

THE TRICK IF THERE IS ONE IS TO RECOGNISE WHAT A GAME IS GOOD AT IT AND WHY PEOPLE LIKE IT THERE'S PLENTY OF GAMES I'VE PLAYED THAT I'M UNIMPRESSED WITH AND WILL PROBABLY NEVER PLAY AGAIN IN MY LIFE BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE AWFUL GAMES THOUGH IN SOME CASES THEY ARE IT'S MORE THAT I'VE GOT SO MANY OTHER GOOD GAMES I'D RATHER PLAY INSTEAD
OUTRIGHT HATING A GAME SHOULD REALLY REQUIRE A LIST OF REASONS THAT ARE SOUND AND LOGICAL EMOTIONALLY REACTING TO GAMES THAT ARE HIGHLY RATED SPEAKS MORE TO SOME DEEPER SEATED STANCE ONE SEEMS TO HAVE

WHAT DIDN'T GET YOUR BLOOD FLOWING WITH BOMI PANDEMIC LEGACY TERRA MYSTIC

LOOKING AT YOUR TOP I DIG ARGENT SURE BATTLETOWN IS SLOW PLODDING CHESS I PREFER EXCEED OVER IT HAVEN'T DONE NOTHING PERSONAL BLOOD RAGE I WASN'T A FAN OF THE DRAFTING AND RUNAWAY LEADER PROBLEM HAVEN'T DONE FORBIDDEN STARS MAY NEVER DO SO

FOR THE SUPER POPULAR GAMES THAT I JUST CAN'T STAND THEY TEND TO BE THE HEAVILY DIVISIVE GAMES SUCH AS CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY CARCASSONNE SETTLERS OF CATAN I CAN'T KNOCK PEOPLE FOR LOVING THEM I JUST KNOW I PERSONALLY WILL BE FRUSTRATED TO PLAY SUCH GAMES UNLESS THOSE ARE LITERALLY THE ONLY GAMES AVAILABLE AND NO MOVIE TO WATCH LOL
I DON'T HATE GAMES BECAUSE THEY ARE POPULAR I DISLIKE GAMES OFTEN BECAUSE OF CERTAIN MECHANICS ONE TYPE OF GAME I DON'T LIKE ARE HIGHLY INTERACTIVE FREE-FOR-ALL AREA CONTROL GAMES I AM TALKING ABOUT GAMES SUCH AS EMET CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD RISK COSMIC ENCOUNTER AND GAME OF THRONES I DON'T LIKE THESE GAMES BECAUSE THEY ARE POPULAR BUT BECAUSE OF HOW RANDOM AND ARBITRARY THAT THESE GAMES CAN END UP BEING I'VE HAD SOME EXPERIENCES IN COSMIC ENCOUNTER THAT HAVE ANNOYED ME I HAD GAMES WHERE A COUPLE WOULD NEVER PLAY ANYTHING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND WOULD ALWAYS TEAM UP EVEN IF IT WASN'T IN THEIR INTEREST TO DO SO I HAD A GAME WHERE ONE PLAYER PICKED ON ANOTHER THE ENTIRE GAME JUST BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY I HAD A GAME WHERE SOMEONE WANTED TO BE A PACIFIST AND WOULDN'T HARM ANYONE EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A LEADER ABOUT TO WIN THESE GAMES PUNISH SKILL BECAUSE ANYONE WHO IS GOOD WILL SIMPLY GET GANGED UP ON EVEN IF YOU ARE BARELY AHEAD IT BECOMES ABOUT HOW WELL YOU CAN MANIPULATE PEOPLE WHO ARE EASILY FOOLED THAN ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME WELL

IF I PLAY AN AREA CONTROL GAME I PREFER GAMES WITH TEAMS SUCH AS REBELLION OR REX FINAL DAYS OF AN EMPIRE IT REMOVES THE DIPLOMACY BARRIER WHICH HELPS PLAYERS WHO SUCK AT IT AS WELL AS MAKING THE GAME FASTER BECAUSE YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO IS YOUR ALLY AND WHO IS YOUR ENEMY RATHER THAN WASTING TIME MANIPULATING PEOPLE
CATAN
NUMBER I LIKE SOME GAMES AND DON'T LIKE OTHERS BUT TRY NOT TO HATE ANYTHING IF THERE WAS ONE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IT WOULD BE KEYFLOWER THAT GAMES FIREWOOD
FROM YOUR LIST THE ONLY GAME I ACTUALLY LIKE AND WANT TO PLAY IS EUPHORIA DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS CONSIDERED A POPULAR GAME THO SEEMS TO THAT IT IS ME THE LEAST TALKED ABOUT STONEMAIER GAME
I HOST A BUNCH OF EVENTS BUT I'VE NEVER MADE THE MOVE TO RENT OUT A PLACE INSTEAD I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING VERY INVOLVED IN YOUR COMMUNITY IS A GREAT WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS AND FROM THERE WORK YOURSELF UP I STARTED WITH HOSTING AT MY OWN PLACE OBVIOUSLY AND ONCE I GOT TO PEOPLE SHOWING UP WEEKLY I MOVED ONTO HOSTING GAME NIGHTS AT STORES AND NOW I'M HELPING RUN HOUR EVENTS AT THESE STORES I'D SAY ONCE YOU'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE SHOW UP TO YOUR EVENTS THEN I WOULD SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY CHEAP OPTIONS TO HOST AT LARGER VENUES FOR EXAMPLE IN MY AREA IF I WANT TO I COULD HOST AT A LOCAL CHURCH FOR FREE YOU COULD ALSO TRY BARS RESTAURANTS AND PRIVATE HALLS ONCE A FRIEND OF MINE SIMPLY USED A HALL AT HIS CONDO TO HAVE HIS OWN BIRTHDAY PARTY AND WE EASILY HAD GUESTS SHOW UP FOR IT AND IT PROBABLY COST HIM TO RENT THE PLACE FOR A NIGHT

SO JUST TO SUM IT UP RUN SMALLER EVENTS AT FREE PLACES AND GET A CONSISTENT ATTENDANCE THEN MOVE ONTO SMALL FREE CHEAP VENUES ALSO BE WILLING TO TAKE A HIT AS WELL BUT BECAUSE YOU PLANNED IT AT A SMALL CHEAP VENUE IT WON'T BE A LARGE ONE THEN LEARN FROM THERE
ACTUALLY THE REAL REASON THEY EXIST IS BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PLAYING CARDS OR TILES OF THE GAME ARE OFTEN NOT BEING AN EXACT MULTIPLE OF THE NUMBER OF CARDS OR TILES THAT FIT ON A SINGLE PRINT SHEET AND PUBLISHERS DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR A WORKER WHO MANUALLY SORTS OUT THE OVERPRINTS WHO COULD THEN ALSO BE A SOURCE OF A PACKAGING ERROR

I USUALLY JUST THROW THEM AWAY
I USUALLY KEEP THEM FOR WHEN WE'RE PLAYING A GAME WHILE MY MONTH OLD IS AWAKE I THEN GIVE THEM TO HER SO SHE CAN PLAY I MUST ADMIT IT WORKED BETTER WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER SHE'S CATCHING ON TO THE BLANK CARDS AND IT'S NOT WORKING VERY WELL ANY MORE BUT ON THE PLUS SIDE SHE'S TRYING TO MIMIC STUFF WE'RE DOING NOW SO WE'RE DEFINITELY RAISING A BOARD GAMER

FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE PLAYING CARCASSONNE THE OTHER NIGHT AND SHE WAS PLAYING WITH THE MEEDLESS OF ONE OF THE COLORS WE WEREN'T USING SHE KEPT TAKING THE MEEDLESS AND PLACING THEM ON ROADS ON THE TILES WE'D ALREADY PLACED SHE'S REALLY GETTING SMART
NOPE AND AFTER HOLDING ON TO ALOT OF THEM FOR YEARS I RECENTLY THREW THEM OUT


BLANK TILES IN ROLL I'M USUALLY PRETTY METHODICAL WHEN UNPACKING GAMES BUT DON'T TREMENDOUS SEEING BLANK TILES
I KEEP THEM I ALWAYS ASSUMED THEY WERE TO HELP WITH THE INEVITABLE LOSS OF A CARD PIECE
I'VE HELD ON TO THE CARD THAT DESIGNATED MY LA GANJA CARDS AS BEING AN ENGLISH PACK INSTEAD OF A GERMAN ONE IT'S JUST A NORMAL CARD ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER SIDE HAS A BIG OLD AMERICAN FLAG I WANT TO COME UP WITH SOME CHEESY VARIANT RULE THAT'S APPROPRIATELY MORISCAN BUT DOESN'T ACTUALLY IMPACT THE GAME
I KEPT THE GHOST STORIES ONE BECAUSE ODD NUMBERS BOTHER ME LOL
WHAT'S THE TERM FOR THE MOMENT WHEN PLAYERS FORGETS A RULE BECAUSE IT HINDERS THEM

CHEATING
SELECTIVE MEMORY
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF PEOPLE FORGETTING RULES JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THEM THESE SOUND MORE LIKE FIDDLY OR AS I LIKE TO CALL THEM FUZZY RULES BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY TO FORGET AND USUALLY THE GAME DOES NOT HAVE AN GOOD WAY TO REMIND YOU OF THE SPECIFIC RULE
TRYING TO PLAY A CARD UP AS PART OF YOUR WONDER IN WONDERS LIKE THEY KNOW HOW THE GAME WORKS AND STILL TRY AND DO THIS WOULDNT THAT JUST BE INCREDIBLY OBVIOUSLY TO ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT THEIR BOARD
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC TERM FOR IT EITHER FORGOT THE RULE IF THEY ACTUALLY FORGOT THE RULE OR CHEATING IF THEY INTENTIONALLY FORGOT THE RULE THIS IS TRUE NO MATTER WHETHER THE RULE BEING FORGOTTEN IS DETRIMENTAL OR NOT
PANDEMIC WHEN TRADING FOR THE LAST CARD YOU NEED TO CURE ON THE SAME TERM HAND SIZE STILL APPLIES I'VE BEEN PLAYING THE APP A LOT AND IT BAFFLES MY MIND HOW OFTEN I DIDN'T DO IT IN THE ACTUAL GAME
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE LOSING VP BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T RAISE YOUR MILITARY AFTER EVERY TIME I COUP I AUDIBLY SAY HOW MANY VP MY OPPONENT WILL LOSE BEFORE SAYING IT IS THERE TURN

WAIT ISN'T THE CHECK MILITARY OPERATIONS PHASE AFTER ALL THE ACTION ROUNDS HAVE BEEN DONE WHEN READING YOUR POST IT SEEMS LIKE YOU PLAY LIKE IT HAPPENS EVERY ACTION ROUND
MOSTLY FAMILIARITY WITH GAMES AND GAME SYSTEMS AND HOW THOSE SYSTEMS INTERACT WITH LOGIC

SOMETIMES GAMES ASK YOU TO DO THINGS THAT SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE AND THOSE ARE USUALLY WHERE THINGS GET LOST

PERSONALLY DON'T CARE MUCH DOES IT BREAK THE GAME IS THE PLAYER HAVING FUN DOES IT INTERFERE WITH ANYONE FUN

HOUSE RULES EXIST FOR A REASON AND IF PLAYING A GAME WRONG MAKES YOU NOT WANT TO PLAY IT WHAT'S THE POINT
AMNESIA BY CONVENIENCE
YOUR WRONG ON THE SPLENDOR RULE YOU CAN DRAW THE SAME COLOR TWICE BUT THAT'S IT AND THAT'S ONLY IF THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THEM
IT'S CUTE THAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHY PEOPLE FORGET THINGS
IF YOU WANT A REALLY LIGHT RPG DUNGEON CRAWLER GO WITH MICE AND MYSTICS I DIDN'T ENJOY IT VERY MUCH AS IT WAS MECHANICALLY REPETITIVE BORING AND OFFERED VERY LITTLE CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION PROGRESSION BASICALLY THE WHOLE GAME IS DICE CHUCKING WITH A CHILDISH STORY AND LACKS ANY STRATEGIC IMPORTANT DECISIONS SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT I DON'T THERE ARE PLENTY OF BETTER OPTIONS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DUNGEON CRAWLER GAME

BLOOD RAGE IS PRETTY USUAL DUDES ON A MAP GAME REPLAY VALUE IS GOOD AS YOU'RE DRAFTING THE CARDS AND CAN TRY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAN MICE AND MYSTICS SO IF YOU PREFER COMPETITIVE GAMES OVER CO-OP GAMES GO WITH BLOOD RAGE IF YOU LOOK UP MORE INFORMATION ABOUT IT YOU'LL FIND COMPLAINTS ABOUT OVERPOWERED CARD COMBINATIONS STRATEGIES WHICH MAY BECOME A PROBLEM IF SOMEONE IN YOUR GAMING GROUP LIKES TO EXPLOIT OP OPTIONS AND DOESN'T VALUE GROUPS ENJOYMENT OVER HIS HER OWN YOU CAN TRY TO PREVENT FROM USING THOSE COMBOS BUT IT'S NOT GUARANTEED BECAUSE OF THE DRAFTING MECHANIC I'VE YET TO SEE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THOSE SO I DON'T THINK THEY'RE A BIG DEAL OTHERWISE THE GAME IS GOOD FOR PLAYERS
AS MENTIONED BEFORE GIVE US MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF GAMES YOU LIKE AND WE CAN ADVISE YOU A BIT BETTER
YOU'VE NOT REALLY GIVEN ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF GAMES YOU ENJOY OR WHAT YOU FEEL IS MISSING FROM YOUR COLLECTION FOR ANYBODY TO MAKE A PERSONALIZED SUGGESTION

BLOOD RAGE IS RATED VERY HIGHLY ON BOTH BG AND THIS SUB AND IS THE ONLY ONE I'VE PLAYED I REALLY LIKE IT FWIW SO IF I HAD TO DECIDE BETWEEN THE TWO WITHOUT CONSIDERING ANY PERSONAL FACTORS I WOULD GO FOR THAT MICE AND MYSTICS IS A RELATIVELY SIMPLE ENTRY INTO CO-OP RAGS DUNGEON CRAWLERS SO MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR A YOUNGER OR NEWER AUDIENCE LOOKING FOR THAT SORT OF EXPERIENCE
HAVEN'T PLAYED MICE AND MYSTICS BUT REALLY LIKE BLOOD RAGE HARD TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU'D LIKE THOUGH
I HAD A BLAST PLAYING MICE AND MYSTICS AS A VETERAN D D PLAYER WITH MY SO WITH NO EXPERIENCE IN THE RULES WERE LIGHT ENOUGH THE GAME HAS A DECENT STORY AND THE GAME IS GORGEOUS WE'RE NOW AT CHAPTER WITH HER MOM AND HER BROTHER AND I'M SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO FINISH THAT CAMPAIGN ASWELL

WE PAINTED THE MINIATURES TOGETHER WE 3D PRINTED SOME STUFF LIKE CHEESE ETC AND RECENTLY WE BOUGHT THE HEART OF GLOAM EXPANSION FOR QUITE CHEAP OTHERWISE WE WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PAINTING THE MINIATURES AND MAKING A FOAM CORE INSERT TO PUT EVERYTHING IN THE MAIN BOX

I CAN RECOMMEND IT BUT THE GAME HAS FLAWS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WANTS TO ACHIEVE AND FOR WHAT AUDIENCE IT IS I PLAYED THE GAME MORE AS A STORY THAN AS A BOARDGAME IF IT WAS TOO HARD I WOULD HELP US IF IT WAS TOO SIMPLE I WOULD HELP THE GAME TO ACHIEVE A BETTER STORY YOU HAVE TO BE FLEXIBLE ATLEAST THAT'S WHAT I THINK

I DON'T HAVE BLOOD RAGE NOR DID I EVER PLAY IT BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IT'S A REALLY GOOD GAME CAN'T COMMENT FURTHER
BLOOD RAGE IS AN EXCELLENT COMPETITIVE AREA CONTROL GAME PLAYS BETTER WITH MORE PEOPLE AND YOU NEED AN EXPANSION TO PLAY WITH FIVE PEOPLE

MICE AND MYSTICS IS A FUN LIGHT DUNGEON CRAWLER YOU PLAY COOPERATIVELY AND FOR THE EXPERIENCE AS WITH ANY DUNGEON CRAWLER THERE IS A LOT OF DICE ROLLING SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE GAMES WITH LUCK TO THEM IT WILL PROBABLY BE A MISS

I REALLY ENJOY BOTH HOWEVER WE ARE PLAYING MANSIONS OF MADNESS OVER ANY OTHER DUNGEON CRAWLERS AT THE MOMENT
HEY FELLOW BRAZILIAN HERE

JUST AS EVERYONE HAS SAID YOU HAVE TO GIVE US MORE INFO ON YOUR PARTICULAR TASTES

I'VE PLAYED BOTH AND GOT RID OF MICE AND MYSTICS IT'S JUST NOT ENGAGING THE STORYLINE IS FINE BUT IF I WANT A COOL STORY I RATHER READ A BOOK
SIMILAR EXPERIENCE HERE I PREORDER RONIN AND THE BOARD WAS MARRED IN A FEW SPOTS I EMAILED GREY FOX AND ALTHOUGH I DIDNT HEAR ANYTHING WITHIN A WEEK I HAD A NEW BOARD IN MY HANDS
BIG SHOUT OUT TO FANTASY FLIGHT HERE TOO REPLACED OF MY TIES FROM STAR WARS REBELLION AFTER THEY BROKE BECAUSE OF LIGHT PLAY AND REPLACED A MISPRINTED DIE FROM MY NEW REY STARTER DECK FROM STAR WARS DESTINY

BOTH WERE IN THE MAIL WITHIN HOURS THEY DO AN AWESOME JOB
FFA IS FANTASTIC ABOUT THIS STUFF A WHILE AGO I REALIZED THAT I HAD LOST A FEW MODELS FROM STARCRAFT THE BOARD GAME SENT IN AN EMAIL ABOUT IT AND THEY SENT OUT THE PIECES WITHIN A WEEK THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT STARCRAFT HAS BEEN OUT OF PRINT FOR YEARS AND ADAMIK FFA DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE LICENSE FOR IT ANYMORE
I'VE HAD GOOD LUCK WITH GREY FOX MY COPY OF DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG HAD SCENE TILES THAT WERE ALL WRONG I HAD 2 EACH OF ONLY HALF THE SCENE TILES I EMAILED OVER A HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND A COMPLETE NEW SET OF TILES WAS IN THE MAIL TO ME THE MORNING OF THE NEXT BUSINESS DAY WITH A FRIENDLY MESSAGE FROM THE WAREHOUSE
I HAD AN ISSUE WITH ONE OF MY SQUADRONS FOR ARMADA NO TREE STAND THING TO PUT THE SHIPS ON THEY SENT ME TWO TO REPLACE IT I'M IN NZ AND I GOT IT IN ABOUT A WEEK SO WAS SUPER HAPPY WITH THAT
UPPERDECK HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT REPLACING DAMAGED OR MISSING PRODUCT IN ALL MY LEGENDARY STUFF I'VE ORDERED
THE CATAN GUYS SENT ME A NEW WHITE CITY IMMEDIATELY WHEN I GOT IT AS IT WAS MISSING PLEASED WITH THEIR SERVICE
WE HOUSE RULE THAT YOU CAN'T USE THE AMUSEMENT PARK POWER ON AN EXTRA TURN BUT ITS JUST THAT A HOUSE RULE
I'VE NEVER PLAYED MK BL BUT I PLAY MK AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK WITH OR WITHOUT GREEN VALLEY OR HARBOR EXPANSIONS DEPENDS SO I DON'T KNOW HOW AMUSEMENT PARK STACKS WITH MOON TOWER BUT IN MK PLAYING SEVERAL TURNS BECAUSE OF DOUBLES INVOKING AMUSEMENT PARK IS TOTALLY LEGIT


I PLAYED A FEW GAMES AND DIDN'T CARE FOR IT AT ALL IN ONE GAME I'M CERTAIN THAT MY OPPONENT MADE SUPERIOR CHOICES BUT I ENDED UP ANNIHILATING HIM HANDILY BECAUSE I ROLLED BETTER AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH GAME THAT I PLAYED FELT OVER LONG BEFORE IT ACTUALLY ENDED

FOR ME THE GAME BROUGHT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW TO THE TABLE I WOULDN'T BUY INTO IT EVEN IF IT WERE AN CG HAVING TO DUMP MONEY INTO IT AS A COLLECTIBLE GAME IS JUST OUT OF THE QUESTION

WOULD NOT PLAY AGAIN
I LOVE CARD BATTLERS BUT HAVE SINCE MOVED AWAY FROM CCDS I LIKE DICE MASTERS BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP AND THE SUPER RARES ARE NOT NECESSARILY ANY BETTER THAN THE COMMONS I LIKE CGS BECAUSE IT'S NOT RANDOM I WAS GOING TO DO SW DESTINY UNTIL I SAW THE RELEASE SCHEDULE AND THE SET BUNDLES FROM STEAM COVENANT THEY PRICE A FULL SET AT AND IF THERE ARE SEVERAL A YEAR THAT'S JUST WAY TOO MUCH MONEY FOR ME SURE YOU DON'T NEED TO OWN EVERYTHING BUT I'VE BECOME SPOILED ON CGS AND WHO WANTS TO BUY BOXES ONLY TO STILL BE MISSING THAT CARD YOU NEED I COULD GET A YEAR OF A CG FOR WELL UNDER
I PLAYED NETRUNNER AT A COMPETITIVE LEVEL TOO
MY OPINIONS FROM THE SW DESTINY PLAYS FAST IT'S RICH IN INTERESTING CHOICES BUT PROBABLY NOT AT THE SAME LEVEL AS NETRUNNER CONSTRUCTED DECKS WILL SURELY BE MORE CONSISTENT THAN THE STARTER KITS AND MORE FUN TO PLAY LIKE NETRUNNER CORE SET STARTING DECKS VS ACTUAL BUILT DECKS

THIS SAID THE BUSINESS MODEL IS WHAT KILLS IT FOR ME IF I'M STEAMROLLER BY A GREAT DECK I CAN'T SIMPLY OPEN MY BINDER AND BUILD IT FOR BUT I HAVE TO PURCHASE A LOT OF OF CARDS
I LIKED IT IT WAS GOOD FUN AND PRETTY SIMPLE TOO THOUGH IT SEEMED POTENTIALLY SNOWBALL PARTICULARLY SINCE IF YOU WERE THE FIRST TO LOSE A CHARACTER IT MEANT YOU WERE ROLLING FEWER DICE IN THE FUTURE

THE DISTRIBUTION IS POTENTIALLY QUITE ANNOYING I OPENED BOOSTERS AND I'D ESTIMATE THAT I CAN'T USE ABOUT HALF OF MY CARDS RIGHT NOW SINCE I BOUGHT ONLY ONE STARTER SET WHICH HAD ONLY VILLAINS NEUTRAL CARDS I HAVEN'T OPENED A YELLOW CHARACTER SO I CAN'T USE ANY YELLOW CARDS FROM BOOSTERS SIMILARLY I ONLY HAVE ONE HERO CHARACTER OPENED NOT ENOUGH TO BUILD A DECK WITH SO I CAN'T USE ANY HERO AFFILIATION CARDS
I'M SURPRISED THERE'S NOT MORE POSITIVE BUZZ FOR THIS GAME RIGHT NOW IT PLAYS FAST IS EASY TO TEACH AND WE'VE FOUND IT TO BE EXTREMELY FUN ONCE YOU START CONSTRUCTING DECKS YOU CAN INTRODUCE MORE DICE MITIGATION AND PLAY MUCH MORE CONSISTENTLY DESPITE THE DICE

DESTINY IS MORE COMPARABLE TO A GAME LIKE POKEMON THAN NETRUNNER IT HAS RANDOMNESS BY THE NATURE OF ITS DESIGN AND THAT'S AN OK THING OWNING EVERYTHING IS FAR FROM NECESSARY AND LIKE POKEMON IT'S JUST A FUN TIME FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED
MY WORST FEAR IS THAT IT'S A GREAT GAME WITH A REALLY SHITTY BUSINESS MODEL I'M STILL DISAPPOINTED FFA DECIDED TO BETRAY WHAT MADE ME LOVE THEM
FAST FUN BATTLER BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC FOR THE DISTRIBUTION MODEL SIMPLE AS THAT REALLY
AS A NETRUNNER PLAYER I FOUND THE GAME TO BE VERY REFRESHING AND FUN A FRIEND AND I THOUGHT WE'D SHOW UP GET OUR PACKS PLAY FOR AN HOUR AND HEAD HOME BUT WE WERE THERE FOR NEARLY HOURS PLAYING GAMES

YES IT'S A CCC SO IF YOU HAVE NO SELF CONTROL OR NEED TO OWN EVERYTHING IT'S GOING TO BE MONUMENTALLY EXPENSIVE BUT IN TERMS OF THE GAME ITSELF IT REALLY IS QUITE FUN AND DESPITE THE SIMPLE RULEBOOK FFA AND SIMPLE RULE BOOK HELL HAS FROZEN OVER THE TACTICS AND DECISIONS FELT VERY MEANINGFUL

I'M PROBABLY GOING TO THROW SOME MONEY INTO THE PIT AND BUY IN FOR A BOOSTER BOX ONCE PER CYCLE IT WAS FAST PACED AND DIFFERENT ENOUGH FROM OTHER GAMES I OWN THAT EVEN IF I'LL LIKELY GET CRUSHED AT WHATEVER TOURNAMENT I GO TO BY THOSE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY I'LL STILL HAVE FUN


I THINK IT'S A PRETTY WELL DESIGNED GAME THERE IS A LOT OF DECISIONS TO BE MADE AND THAT TAKES PLACE REMOVING OPPONENTS DICE AND WHATNOT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL HOW MUCH THE RARE LEGENDARY CARDS WILL MAKE OR BREAK THE GAME OBVIOUSLY IT CAN BE PRICEY IF YOU WANT TO GO COMPETITIVE FOR ME I'M PLANNING ON PLAYING AN OCCASIONAL GAME DURING LUNCH AT WORK WITH A CO-WORKER SO WE CAN LIMIT OUR PURCHASES AND TRY TO KEEP IT FAIR BETWEEN US
FORMER MTG PLAYER HERE WAY BACK IN THE DAY AND I LIKE THE LOOK OF IT AS A GAME THE CCC MODEL IS A HUGE TURN OFF FOR ME THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS THE ODD CASUAL GAME WHEN IT COMES TO DECK BUILDING GAMES YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL ALWAYS FEEL INCOMPLETE DUE TO THE LACK OF STRUCTURED PLAY THAT COMES WITH LACK OF CARD OPTIONS
MY WIFE AND I THINK IT'S AWESOME I'M JUST GLAD WE'VE FOUND SOMETHING COMPETITIVE THAT WE CAN BOTH GET INTO AND HAVE FUN WITH SHE'S A GAMER TO THE BONE BUT THINGS LIKE NETRUNNER AND ARE NOT REALLY HER BAG
CG VS CCC DISCUSSION IS ALWAYS SO IN FAVOR OF CG ALTHOUGH I GUESS THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE WHOLE SUBGAPE OF TRADING OPENING PACKS AND EVERYTHING CCC DOESN'T INHERENTLY NEED TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE EITHER IT'S JUST ABOUT HOW THE COMPANY DOES IT CCC MAKES PEOPLE THINK OF MAGIC WHICH IS STUPIDLY EXPENSIVE YES BUT SOME HAVE SILLY CASHGRABS TOO LIKE MAKING GREAT CARDS IN BASE SETS A OF SO YOU STILL NEED TO BE COMPETITIVE AND HAVING STUPIDLY LONG ROTATION CYCLE AND FAST UPDATE SCHEMES THAT YOU NEED A LOT

ALL IN ALL MOST OF THESE COMPETITIVE GAMES ARE EXPENSIVE AND HAVE A LARGE META PART THAT A NEWCOMER IS HOPELESS AGAINST THE TRIED AND TESTED DECKS BUILDS OF THE EXPERIENCED PLAYERS GUESS THAT'S PART OF THE APPEAL

CCC DOES HAVE SOME BENEFITS AS WELL AS HAVING NATURALLY NICE DRAFTING AVAILABLE CG FORMATS CAN HAVE THAT AS WELL WITH CUBE SETUPS ETC BUT THAT'S IT

PERSONALLY I'VE STOPPED PLAYING ALL OF THESE I FIND THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ONLY PLAY THEM WITH EXPERIENCED PLAYERS AND A LIMITED SCENE A BIT ANNOYING AND THEY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE I OCCASIONALLY LIKE TO DO A MTG DRAFT OR SEALED I JUST SELL OR GIVE AWAY MY CARDS AFTER BUT THAT'S IT

I'D LIKE IT IF THERE ACTUALLY WAS A CASUAL CCC CG WHERE COSTS WOULDN'T BE SO HIGH LIKE A PACK OF CARDS WOULD JUST BE BUCK
SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE IS MY CO-OP ANSWER ON THESE BOARDS
PAPERBACK IS YOUR ANSWER CAN PLAY COOP OR COMPETITIVELY DEPENDING ON YOUR MOOD AND EASILY SCALES TO PLAYERS YOUR WIFE CAN SCHOOL YOU WITH HER VOCABULARY WHILE YOU FLEX YOUR BOARD GAME DECK BUILDING SKILLS
SOUNDS SIMILAR TO MY WIFE SO HOPEFULLY IF YOU TAKE ANY OF MY ADVICE IT WORKS OUT FOR YA

MINE STRONGLY DISLIKES PANDEMIC AND I'M ON MY WAY THOUGH PANDEMIC THE CURE WE BOTH LIKE IT FEELS LIKE WE GET MORE CONTROL OVER OUR TURNS AND THINGS ARE MORE TACTICAL THAN STRATEGIC

HONESTLY I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK AT VITICULTURE MY WIFE LOVES IT AND SO DO I IT WORKS FROM TO PLAYERS THOUGH I HAVE ONLY PLAYED IT SO FAR AND I PREFER IT AT 2 I'VE HEARD IT'S BEST AT EVEN COUNTS THOUGH I DID ENJOY THE SOLO MODE A LOT TOO

BEYOND THAT I THINK GAMES THAT WORK BEST AT 2 OR ARE DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR 2 ARE WHAT YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH GETTING SOMETHING FOR YOU TO PRIMARILY PLAY WITH YOUR WIFE PATCHWORK JAIPUR LEGACY THE TESTAMENT OF DUKE DE CRECY SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE AND THEN WE HELD HANDS

MY WIFE ALSO LIKES THE DR FINN GAMES LIKE BIBLIOG CAPO DEI API AND COSMIC RUN THE LATTER IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE AND IT SUPPORTS PLAYERS I BELIEVE I'VE PLAYED IT SOLO AND WITH HER AND SHE ALSO LIKED IT

ANOTHER THAT WORKS WELL AT 2 PLAYERS IS EMPIRE LEGENDS IF YOU'RE AFTER SOME AREA CONTROL WE BOTH LIKE THAT ONE IT'S SIMPLE BUT FUN AND FAIRLY FAST ABOUT MINUTES PER PLAYER PROBABLY IF YOU THINK CATAN IS TOO SIMPLE THIS IS SIMPLER SO THERE'S THAT BUT I LIKE IT MORE THAN CATAN I DON'T OWN CATAN THOUGH

MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION IS BEYOND BAKER STREET IT'S USING THE CORE MECHANIC FROM HANAFI BUT LAYERS ON THEME A GAME BOARD AND IT WORKS GREAT AT 2 PLAYERS AND GOES UP TO IT'S A GREAT LITTLE GAME
TAKE A LOOK AT SPLENDOR LORDS OF THE WATERDEEP EXP SHAKESPEARE AND MAYBE KEYFLOWER
TRY PATCHWORK MY WIFE AND I KEEP IT ON OUR TOP GAMES AT HOME
MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE PERFECT GAME AS WELL HERE ARE OUR TOPS SO FAR

STAR REALMS LIGHT CHEAP SIMPLE TO TEACH BUT A VERY DECEPTIVE LEVEL OF DEPTH THE FACTIONS AND DECK BUILDING IN HERE ARE FINE TUNED TO BE A VERY ENGAGING GAME WITH MULTIPLE LEVELS OF STRATEGY FIT INSIDE A SMALL MINUTE GAME

CASTLES OF BURGUNDY JUST WANTED TO NOTE WE LOVE IT TOO

AGRICOLA AGRICOLA ABEAM GREAT VERY WELL BALANCED GAME LOTS OF PIECES AND SETUP SO WE ACTUALLY PREFER THE APP VERSION WE COULD SPEND AN ENTIRE DAY PLAYING THESE

LE HAVRE WE LIKE THIS GAME A TON TOO APP VERSION ALSO GOOD HERE BUT CAN BE HARDER TO SEE ALL YOUR OPTIONS

SEASONS NOT TALKED ABOUT VERY OFTEN BUT BETWEEN THE ARTWORK AND GAME PLAY THIS IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITES I WOULD SAY COMPARABLE IN SOME WAYS TO CASTLES

ROBINSON CRUSOE TAKES A BIT LONGER TO PLAY BUT VERY STRATEGIC AND REWARDING GAME PLAY

OTHER GAMES I WISH MY WIFE WOULD LIKE MORE THAT ARE OBJECTIVELY GOOD

STAR WARS REBELLION PLAYED A GAME WITH MY FRIEND AND REALLY LIKED IT BUT MY WIFE IS GENERALLY AGAINST ANYTHING STAR WARS IT BORES HERALDRY HOPEFULLY THE MOVIES GET BETTER AND SHE STARTS TO LIKE IT MORE

SUMMONER WARS I THINK IT'S A GOOD LIGHT STRATEGY CARD GAME WITH PHYSICAL POSITIONING BUT MY WIFE DOESN'T LIKE IT BC SHE FEELS IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH OPTIONS
KING OF TOKYO TIDES OF MADNESS TRURO LOVE LETTER ARE SOME I PLAY WITH MY WIFE WHO DOESN'T LIKE ALOT OF COMPONENTS EITHER


PLEASE LOOK AT THE WHAT SHOULD I GET PSIG TAB THE AMOUNT GAMES TO PICK MAY FEEL OVERWHELMING BUT IT'S ALL REALLY GOOD

HOWEVER HERE ARE MY ESSENTIALS EITHER WAY

PANDEMIC MISSION RED PLANET JAMAICA DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG TICKET TO RIDE KING OF TOKYO VITICULTURE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM CONCORDIA
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT PANDEMIC FOR STARTERS


IT'S GREAT TO KNOW THE TYPE OF GAMES YOU LIKE BUT WHO WILL YOU BE PLAYING WITH

I DID THE SAME AS OTHERS ARE SUGGESTING AND BOUGHT A BUNCH OF THE MOST POPULAR GAMES AT THE TIME IT WAS PANDEMIC SMASH UP KING OF TOKYO CAVERN WONDERS AND SPLENDOR

QUICKLY LEARNED THOUGH THAT MY GROUP LIKES MORE SOCIAL GAMES BLUFFING GAMES AND DEFINITELY NOY ENGINE BUILDING AND WORKER PLACEMENT

I SPENT A TON OF MONEY ON GAMES THAT WOULD JUST SIT I SOLD SOME I LEARNED WHAT MY GROUP LIKED MADE ADJUSTMENTS AND IT'S MUCH BETTER

ONE GAME THAT HAS NOT FAILED YET FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GROUPS IS COLT EXPRESS
VITICULTURE EE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES I BOUGHT WHICH I HEARTILY RECOMMEND I WILL BE RECEIVING THE TUSCANY EE EXPANSION TOMORROW WHICH WILL BE PLAYED ON THANKSGIVING

BIG BOOK OF MADNESS IS ANOTHER RELATIVELY SIMPLE GAME THAT CAN BE PLAYED COOPERATIVELY WITH NEWER PLAYERS

TAKENOKO IS EASY TO LEARN AND GORGEOUS MY FIRST DESIGNER BOARD GAME TOO ANOTHER EASY ONE FOR NEW PLAYERS IS ESCAPE ZOMBIE CITY WHICH PROVIDES CHAOTIC TIMED FUN
HOW DID YOU COME TO THE HOBBY WHAT GAMES S DID YOU PLAY THAT MADE YOU SAY I LIKE THIS AND WANT TO EXPERIENCE MORE OF IT IT CAN GIVE US A FRAME OF REFERENCE TO GO FROM
THERE ARE NO REAL ESSENTIALS

I'D SUGGEST GOING ALONG TO A GAME GROUP IF YOU HAVE ONE LOCAL AND PLAYING OTHER PEOPLE'S GAMES FOR A WHILE TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT GAMES YOU LIKE THEN YOU CAN BUILD UP YOUR COLLECTION FROM THERE
HEY I'M NEW TO THE HOBBY AS WELL SO TAKE MY REC WITH A PINCH OF SALT

I'M GOING TO SUGGEST SOMETHING I SEE RARELY SPOKEN ABOUT I THINK FOR A GREAT CO-OP GAME YOU SHOULD AT LEAST LOOK AT LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN

FIRSTLY YOU SHOULD LOOK UP DECK BUILDERS AND DECIDE WHETHER YOU WOULD ENJOY THOSE MECHANICS BECAUSE AT IT'S CORE THAT IS WHAT IT IS IT'S SIMILAR TO ASCENSION FOR EXAMPLE BUT I SUGGEST THIS GAME BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS ONE OF THE MOST REPAYABLE GAMES I OWN YOU CAN PLAY THROUGH THE MOVIES WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IT WORKS WITH DIFFERENT GROUP NUMBERS AND YOU HAVE EXTRA RULES TO MAKE IT EASIER OR HARDER OR JUST TO SPICE THINGS UP

ALSO IF YOU REALLY ENJOY THE GAME THERE IS AN EXPANSION RELEASED TOMORROW PLUS IT ALREADY FULLY INTEGRATES WITH LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS PREDATOR FOR AP FUN LE PREDATOR WORKS STAND ALONE TOO

IT'S EASY TO LEARN AND TEACH BUT IT IS A CHALLENGING GAME SOMETIMES RANDOM CHANCE WILL KILL YOU BUT MOST THE TIME YOU CAN PLAY AROUND LOTS OF THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN ONCE YOU KNOW THE CARDS AND SCENARIOS

SO IN SUMMARY IT'S A CO-OP DECK BUILDER THAT'S GOT LONGEVITY THROUGH CHALLENGE AND LOT'S OF DIFFERENT RULE SETS AND IT'S EXPANDABLE IF YOU REALLY ENJOY IT
MY OWN SUGGESTION IS SETTLERS OF CATAN GREAT PLAYER COMPETITIVE GAME EASY TO LEARN FUN FOR ALMOST EVERYONE IF YOU WANT TO UP THE DIFFICULTY YOU CAN BUY THE KNIGHTS AND CITIES EXPANSION WHICH MAKES THE GAME PERFECT FOR ME THERE ARE ALSO PLAYER EXPANSIONS WHICH MAKE THE GAME SLIGHTLY SLOWER BUT IT'S STILL A GOOD TIME WITH FRIENDS
I'D SUGGEST TWO THINGS

FIRST FIND A THEME OR MECHANISM YOU LIKE DO THIS BY PLAYING GAMES AT A LOCAL STORE OR GROUP THINK OF YOUR PLAY GROUP WILL LIKE IT NOTHING STINKS WORSE THAN PLUNKING ON A GAME THAT SINKS

SECOND THERE ARE A BROAD CATEGORY OF GAMES CALLED GATEWAYS THESE ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS LIGHT FAMILY FRIENDLY TITLES THAT ARE A GOOD STEP FROM THE HASBRO FARE WE GREW UP WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL'S LIST IS DIFFERENT BUT HERE'S MY SUGGESTIONS

DEXTERITY LIKE JENA JUNK ART AMAZING STACKING GAME WITH IRREGULAR SHAPES AND DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE RETAIL PRICE TAG

ROUTEBUILDING TICKET TO RIDE PROBABLY THE GAME THAT I HAVE PLAYED THE MOST FUN AND QUICK DOESN'T OUTSTAY IT'S WELCOME

DEDUCTION LIKE CLUE LOVE LETTER CLEVER POCKET SIZED GAME ABOUT DEDUCING PLAYER'S HAND BRILLIANT GAME FOR

SOCIAL DEDUCTION GROUP CLUE WEREWOLF THIS IS A RIOT OF A PARTY GAME RESISTANCE IS GOOD AS WELL BUT WITH A LITTLE MORE RULES REGARDLESS IT'S A HIDDEN IDENTITY TEAM GAME OF WIPING THE OTHER TEAM OUT BY LYING

STRATEGY IMHOTEP MOST PEOPLE RECOMMEND CATAN BUT CATAN IS YEARS OLD IT'S GOOD BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH IT KING MAKING DICE ROLLING LONG IMHOTEP IS A BRILLIANT AND ACCESSIBLE GAME THAT TAKES MINUTES TO LEARN AND PLAYS UNDER AN HOUR MY FAVORITE GAME FROM THIS YEAR

COOPERATIVE PANDEMIC CLASSIC COOPERATIVE GAME THEME AND GAMEPLAY IS SPOT ON LOVE THIS GAME

CARD GAME ARCHAEOLOGY A NEW EXPLORATION GREAT SET COLLECTING GAME WITH VARIABLE PLAY MODES IN THE BOX FANTASTIC AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

DICE GAME QWIXX LIGHT GAME THAT PLAYS MORE LIKE A PUZZLE YOU CAN GET THE DELUXE VERSION TODAY AT TARGET FOR LESS THAN

TILE LAYING TRURO GREAT AND FAST GAME IT WON'T BLOW YOUR MIND BUT WANT TO REPLAY IT

DECKBUILDER LIKE MAGIC SORT OF DOMINION KIND OF A DRAB THEME BUT THIS GAME REALLY HAS LEGS YOU BUY CARDS IN GAME TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR DECK VERY CLEVER AND FUN

TRIVIA WITS WAGERS TRIVIA GAME THAT DOESN'T PUNISH NOT KNOWING THE ANSWERS

ROLL AND MOVE FORMULA D RACING GAME THAT MAKES CLEVER USE OF BIGGER AND LARGER FACE COUNT DICE TO REPRESENT GEARS THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH A RUNAWAY WINNER BUT IT'S STILL FUN
MY THOUGHTS AS FOLLOWS HOWEVER PLEASE DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND RESEARCH BEFOREHAND I TEND TO GEAR TOWARDS HR PLUS GAMES WITH TOUGH DECISION MAKING

AREA CONTROL CLOCKWORK WARS HRS

IN APRIL OF NEXT YEAR MY GAME TRAIN HEIST WILL BE RELEASED VIA THE PUBLISHER CRYPTOZOIC WHICH IS CO-OP COMPETITIVE AND PLAYER GAME
IF THERE IS ONE NEAR YOU GET YOURSELF TO A BOARDGAME NEETUP OR A BOARD GAME CAFE ALWAYS BETTER TO TRY BEFORE YOU BUY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE
YOUR TASTES WILL VARY OF COURSE BUT FOR A NEWCOMER WHICH I WAS 2 YEARS AGO THE SHEER VOLUME OF CHOICES CAN BE OVERWHELMING HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW MAINSTAYS THAT I THINK EVERY GAMER SHOULD CHECK OUT TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH POPULAR MECHANISMS AND TO SEE WHAT THEY LIKE STARTING WITH THE BIG OF MODERN GAMES

TICKET TO RIDE THIS GAME IS A CONTEMPORARY CLASSIC AND IS WHAT I HAVE FOUND THE BROADEST SUCCESS WITH AMONG FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO ARE NEW TO GAMES THE RULES ARE SIMPLE COLLECT SETS OF CARDS AND THEN SPEND THEM TO BUILD TRAIN ROUTES BETWEEN CITIES THERE IS HOWEVER A GREAT DEAL OF DEPTH AND STRATEGY TO BE FOUND ONCE YOU'VE PLAYED A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THE ARTWORK AND CHARM SHINE REALLY WELL ON THE TABLE A CHARACTERISTIC OF MANY DAYS OF WONDER GAMES

CARCASSONNE WHILE TICKET TO RIDE HELPED INTRODUCE MY FAMILY TO GAMES THE GAME THAT HAS HAD THE MOST STAYING POWER IS WITHOUT QUESTION CARCASSONNE AGAIN THE RULES ARE DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE EACH TURN YOU DRAW A TILE OUT OF A BAG AND ADD IT TO AN EVER-GROWING MAP TRYING TO STRATEGICALLY PLACE PIECES TO GAIN POINTS ALONG THE WAY BUT WHEN YOU REALLY DIG INTO THE MEAT OF THIS GAME IT CAN GET EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE AND HAS MORE CONFLICT THAN YOU WOULD IMAGINE IF YOU ADD THE FIRST TWO EXPANSIONS IT BECOMES A BALANCE OF DEPTH AND DIFFICULTY

CATAN ARGUABLY THE GRANDDADDY OF MODERN GAMES IN THE WEST CATAN IS STILL A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE AND WORTH PLAYING AS A WAY TO ACCLIMATE YOURSELF WITH COMMON MECHANISMS LIKE RESOURCE GATHERING AREA CONTROL AND NEGOTIATION

OTHER CONTEMPORARY CLASSICS

PANDEMIC IF THERE IS A FOURTH GAME THAT HAS MOST SHAPED MODERN GAMING AND BASICALLY ESTABLISHED THE COOPERATIVE GENRE IT'S PANDEMIC YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS CAN TRY TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM INFECTIOUS AND DEADLY DISEASES IT'S FUN IT'S EASY TO LEARN AND THE DIFFICULTY CAN BE ADJUSTED IN A BRILLIANTLY SIMPLE WAY TO ACCOMMODATE NEWIES AND PROS ALIKE

CODENAMES IF YOU HAVE A RELATIVELY LARGE GROUP OF PLAYERS AND OR YOU WANT SOMETHING A BIT MORE CASUAL THAT CAN BE ENJOYED WITH DRINKS OR AS A FILLER BETWEEN OTHER THINGS CODENAMES IS THE GAME FOR YOU IT'S ALWAYS A HUGE HIT AT LARGE GATHERINGS AND SCRATCHES THE WORD GAME AND PARTY GAME ITCH IN A WAY THAT FOR ME A GAME LIKE CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY DOESN'T

DOMINION IF YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS LIKE MAGIC THE GATHERING HEARTHSTONE OR BASICALLY ANY OTHER TCG OR CCC IN RECENT MEMORY DOMINION MIGHT BE WORTH A LOOK THERE ARE STILL CCDS AND CGS FOR FANS OF SPECIFIC LICENSED PROPERTIES LIKE STAR WARS AND GAME OF THRONES OUT THERE AND EVEN OTHER ARGUABLY BETTER DECKBUILDERS BUT DOMINION LIKE PANDEMIC ESTABLISHED A BASELINE FOR ITS GENRE AND IT REMAINS AN EXTREMELY POPULAR AND WELL-SUPPORTED GAMED TO THIS DAY IT'S ALSO THE GAME THAT GOT MY FIANCE HOOKED SO THAT'S WORTH A MENTION

YOU REALLY CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANY OF THESE I WOULD CHECK OUT AS WELL ANYTHING IN THE TOP GAMES IS USUALLY PRETTY STELLAR BUT OF COURSE THAT IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND VARIES ACCORDING TO TASTE AS WELL I WOULD ALSO CHECK OUT SOME ONLINE VIDEO REVIEWERS IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN A GAME TO SEE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT

WELCOME TO THE FAMILY
ISLE OF SKYE A MORE EVOLVED TILE LAYING GAME WHICH COMBINES MANY OTHER GAME MECHANICS AUCTION BIDDING BLUFFING PRETTY LIGHT I PLAY WITH MY YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND VERY FUN

FORBIDDEN DESERT EVER SO SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT THAN FI BUT STILL ENTRY LEVEL
PANDEMIC THE CURE IF YOU LIKE THE IDEA OF CHUCKING DICE OVER DRAWING CARDS
MYSTERIUM GOOD FOR GROUPS OF TO ITS A COOL MURDER MYSTERY GAME A COMBINATION OF DIXIT AND CLUE
BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL THE NEXT STEP UP AS IT THROWS IN A TRAITOR AND RULES ARE MORE VERBOSE

IF YOU'RE DESPERATE FOR A GAME OF SNAKE OIL JUST FIND A RANDOM WORD GENERATOR AND PRINT OUT RANDOM NOUNS THINK OF OR SO JOBS AND MAKE CARDS FOR THEM RULES ARE ONLINE BAM SNAKE OIL
AH I HAVE A COPY I RARELY PLAY BUT UNFORTUNATELY DECIDED A WHILE AGO NOT TO STORE IT IN THE ORIGINAL BOX VERY CHEAP PLASTIC INSERT AND VERY CHEAP TUCK BOX SO THREW THEM OUT

IF YOU'D HAVE ANY INTEREST IN BUYING AN UNBOXED COPY LET ME KNOW I'M BASED IN BRIGHTON

I KICKSTARTED BAD MEDICINE AND HAVEN'T PLAYED SNAKE OIL SINCE RECEIVING THAT
I PLAYED ASYLUM WITH TWO USING THE RULE AND DIDN'T LIKE THE EXPERIENCE I WANT TO PLAY THE EXPANSIONS WITH MORE PEOPLE
I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO JUST TRY TO GET 2 MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE EVEN WAS NEVER INTENDED AND IS THE ONLY OPTIMAL PLAYER COUNT

YOU WILL ENJOY IT A LOT MORE AND YOU WILL NOT NEED TO HOUSE RULE TO TRY AND MAKE IT WORK YOU ONLY GET A FEW HOURS TO EXPERIENCE EACH SCENARIO SO MAKE IT COUNT
PLAYING ONE CHARACTER EACH WORKED FOR US WE FINISHED ASYLUM IN TWO SESSIONS
I PLAYED IT WITH FOUR AND IT WAS KIND OF MPH IN OUR OPINION IT WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY SUCKED WITH 2 I THINK
MY WIFE AND I HAVE PLAYED THROUGH THE ASYLUM AND SEVERAL OF THE EXPANSIONS WITH JUST ONE CHARACTER EACH AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY FINE FOR THE MOST PART

IN ONE OF THE STORIES CAN'T RECALL WHICH AT THE TOP OF MY HEAD MAYBE PROPHECY OF DRAGONS WE FELT THERE WAS AN APPARENT NEED FOR A THIRD ONE SO WHEN RESTARTING THE RUN WE ADDED ONE MORE GUY AS AN ALLY WHO JUST FOLLOWED US AROUND

BUT JUST TRY WITH TWO AND WING IT IT'S MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE THAT WAY IMHO AND I DON'T REALLY WANT TO COMPLETE THE MISSION IN AS LITTLE TIME AS POSSIBLE ANYWAY I WANT SOME VALUE FOR MY MONEY

AND BOB'S GOING TO BITCH ABOUT YOUR PROGRESS NO MATTER WHAT

I'VE ONLY PLAYED GHOST STORIES BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY IT'S FANTASTIC IT CAN TEND TOWARDS THE AP PLAYERS A BIT IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE A BLAST AND IT'S DEFINITELY A I'VE PLAYED QUITE A FEW AND IF YOU DON'T COUNT PANDEMIC LEGACY IT'S DEFINITELY THE BEST IMO THE TRAITOR COOPS BG SOC HAVE SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT TO THEM BUT IN A LOT OF WAYS I STILL PREFER GHOST STORIES SO GOOD
I HAVE JAMAICA AND PLAY IT OFTEN WITH ADULTS IT'S A REALLY GOOD GAME TO INTRODUCE TO BEGINNERS IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT AND THE MECHANICS AREN'T TOO COMPLICATED FOR NEWIES EVERYONE I KNOW ADULTS WHO HAVE PLAYED IT HAVE ENJOYED IT ONE OF MY FRIENDS EVEN PURCHASED A COPY SHE LIKED IT SO MUCH
JAMAICA IS GREAT I TEACH IT TO EVERYONE AND WE ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT TIME PLAYING IT TERROR IN NEEDLE CITY IS A LITTLE TOUGHER TO GET ON THE TABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BLOW OR MOVE AROUND ALL THE TIME
TERROR IN STEEPLE CITY IS A FUN BRAINLESS GAME ENJOY THROWING BUSES AT EACH OTHER AND MISSING LAUGH AT SOMEONE FAILING TO BLOW OVER A BUILDING CRY WHEN YOU POOR MONSTER FAILS TO MAKE IT UP TO THE PAVEMENT FOR THE FOURTH FLICK IN A ROW

IT'S A FUN FILLER WITH PEOPLE WHO TAKE IT AS SUCH
I CAN ONLY COMMENT ON JAMAICA I REALLY LIKE IT IT'S FUN IT'S PRETTY IT'S ABOUT PIRATES AND IT'S PRETTY THE BOARD IS BEAUTIFUL THE CARDBOARD CHITS FEEL NICE AND THE LITTLE SHIPS ARE COOL

EVERY TIME I'VE PLAYED IT IT'S BEEN FUN I'VE PLAYED IT WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO AREN'T INTO BOARDGAMES BUT HAVE HAD A GOOD TIME AND ENJOYED IT SO NO NOT TOO SIMPLE FOR ADULTS JUST FUN


I'VE PLAYED THEM ALL OF THEM GHOST STORIES IS LIKELY MY FAVOURITE

JAMAICA IS A FUN FAMILY GAME OF ROLL AND MOVE AROUND AN ISLAND IT'S PROBABLY THE MOST FUN I'VE HAD WITH A ROLL AND MOVE GAME BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL INTERESTING DECISIONS TO BE HAD IT LOOKS GORGEOUS ON THE TABLE GREAT FOR KIDS AND OKAY FOR ADULTS BUT NOT FOR LONG

TERROR IN STEEPLE CITY RAMPAGE IS ANOTHER FUN FAMILY GAME WHERE EVERYONE GETS TO WRECK STUFF THIS SOUNDS MORE FUN THAN IT ACTUALLY IS THOUGH BECAUSE AFTER ONE OR TWO GAMES THE NOVELTY HAS BEEN A BIT EXHAUSTED IT'S ALSO A PAIN IN THE TO SET UP GREAT FOR KIDS BUT LIKE JAMAICA ADULTS WILL LOSE INTEREST QUICKLY

GHOST STORIES WILL START BY FRUSTRATING YOU TO NO END BECAUSE IT'S A CHALLENGE THAT'S GOOD THOUGH BECAUSE IT'S A FUN CHALLENGE AND YOU'LL GET BETTER AT IT OVER TIME WAVE AFTER WAVE OF GHOST WARRIOR WILL APPEAR AND YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST AND MOST EFFICIENT WAYS OF DEALING WITH THEM IT'S FUN
TERROR IN STEEPLE CITY FEELS LIKE A GAME THAT I WOULD ENJOY ONCE A YEAR AT SOMEONE HOUSE

GHOST STORIES IS PRETTY DIFFICULT DON'T EXPECT YOU'LL WIN MUCH BUT WHEN YOU DO IT'S AWESOME I OWN IT MYSELF GORGEOUS ART GORGEOUS THEME IT'S ALL ABOUT MITIGATING DICE OUR GROUP PREFERS PANDEMIC OVER GHOST STORIES BUT THAT'S BECAUSE OUR GROUP PLAYS LIGHTER GAMES

NEVER PLAYED JAMAICA BUT THE DICE TOWER IS PRETTY POSITIVE ABOUT IT
I LOVE GHOST STORIES ONE OF MY FAVORITES THE RULEBOOK IS BAD THOUGH IT'S INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING SO IF YOU A PROBLEM LOSING A LOT LOOK ELSEWHERE

I'VE ONLY PLAYED RAMPAGE IMC WITH ADULTS WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE HOW BAD YOU ALL ARE AT FLICKING I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO JUVENILE SETUP IS A BIT ANNOYING BECAUSE YOU'RE PLACING MEEDLESS IN RANDOM ORDER WITH HELP IT CAN GO QUICKLY

NEVER PLAYED JAMAICA IT'S ON MY WISELIEST THOUGH
GHOST STORIES HAS AN ATROCIOUS RULEBOOK FOR ME IT FELT VAGUE AND I NEEDED TO WATCH A VIDEO TO CORRECT MY PLAY AFTER READING IT MULTIPLE TIMES AND PLAYING PRACTISE ROUNDS AFTER YOU GET PAST THAT THE GAME IS GOOD ENOUGH I'M NOT A FAN OF GENERALLY BUT THIS PUZZLE CAN BE INTERESTING I WOULD RECOMMEND IF YOU KNOW YOU ENJOY

JAMAICA IS AN EXCELLENT GATEWAY STYLE FAMILY GAME THAT SEEMS RANDOM BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE BEST PLAYER COMES OUT AHEAD REALLY LOVE THIS GAME GATE THE TREASURE MAP STYLE FINDING RULEBOOK BUT LUCKILY YOU ALMOST NEVER HAVE TO LOOK AT IT

TERROR IN STEEPLE CITY IS AWESOME IT'S AN HOUR OF GOOD SOLID FUN AND THERE IS ENOUGH STRATEGY THERE TO SATISFY PEOPLE WHO DON'T EMBRACE THE THEME I LOVE IT SO MUCH A BOUGHT TWO COPIES SO I CAN DO TWO BOARD MEGA GAMES

JAMAICA AND TERROR IN STEEPLE CITY ARE NOT TO KIDDY AND ARE GREAT WITH ADULTS DON'T BRING THEM TO YOUR LOCAL HEAVY EURO PLAYERS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GAMES BUT THEY DO WHAT THEY SAY ON THE TIN
I'M PERSONALLY NOT A FAN OF GHOST STORIES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO THE POINT IT PUT OFF OUR GROUP FROM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WIN IT FELT LIKE A GRIND TO ME THE DICE ROLLS THAT DECIDE A LOT OF EVENTS I FOUND VERY FRUSTRATING

EVEN WHEN TRYING TO PLAY THE ODDS AS BEST WE COULD IT JUST FELT LIKE AN UNLUCKY ROLL RUINED IT ALL IN A WAY THAT DIDN'T FEEL FUN

OTHER PEOPLE LOVE IT THOUGH
GHOST STORIES IS A TERRIFIC GAME BUT IT IS BRUTALLY DIFFICULT IT TOOK US FOUR GAMES TO BEAT IT ON BEGINNER

JAMAICA IS ALWAYS A HIT WITH WHATEVER GROUP I BRING IT OUT FOR LIGHT-HEARTED PIRATE BATTLE FUN
I LOVE CO-OP GAMES AND I'VE PLAYED DOZENS OF THEM OVER THE YEARS AND I STILL CONSIDER GHOST STORIES EITHER THE BEST OR CLOSE TO IT
I WOULD RECOMMEND DIAMANT I ONLY FOUND THE FRENCH VERSION BUT THE RULES ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE IN ENGLISH ON BG AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO REMEMBER EVERYTHING ONCE YOU READ THEM ONCE THE COMPONENTS HAVE NO TEXT ON THEM

THIS IS BASICALLY THE SAME AS INCAN GOLD BUT I THINK DIAMANT HAS NICER COMPONENTS

A COUPLE OTHER GAMES I CAN THINK OF THAT SUPPORT PLAYERS AND WOULD MAYBE BE OK FOR KIDS UNUSUAL SUSPECTS MAYBE SABOTEUR TELESTRATIONS MAYBE CASH N GUNS IF YOU'RE OK WITH FOAM GUNS AND POINTING AT EACH OTHER DIMMET SPYFAULT MAYBE IT'S HARD TO KNOW ABOUT A COUPLE OF THOSE IF IS OLD ENOUGH OR NOT MY KID JUST TURNED AND A YEAR FROM NOW I AM NOT SURE IF HE COULD PLAY SOME OF THESE I HOPE SO
THE USUAL ADVICE WHEN PLAYING WITH KIDS IS TO GO FOR CODENAMES PICTURES IT'S MORE DIRECT AT TIMES LIKE YOU SEE A PICTURE OF A SPIDER YOU CAN GIVE THE CLUE SPIDER BUT IS A PRETTY YOUNG AGE AND CODENAMES CAN ACTUALLY BE DIFFICULT FOR A KID THAT AGE TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND ANYONE AGED AND ABOVE SHOULD BE FINE

WITH A BUNCH OF KIDS DEXTERITY GAMES GENERALLY WORK WELL TOO GO CUCKOO IS ONE THAT I HAVE TRIED WITH YEAR OLDS IT'S ALSO A GAME I PLAY WITH JUST ADULTS WITH DRINKING RULES WHEN PLAYING WITH KIDS YOU CAN MAKE IT SIMPLE AND ALWAYS BUILD UP THE NEST WHEN PLAYING WITH ADULTS YOU CAN PLAY VERY CUT THROAT AND ALWAYS TRY TO SABOTAGE EACH OTHER SO I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS IT WORKS WELL WITH ALL AGES AND PLAY STYLE CAN BE ADJUSTED DEPENDING ON THE AGE RANGE HAHA I THINK THE MAX PLAYER COUNT IS BUT MY FRIENDS AND I HAVE JUST SPLIT INTO TEAMS WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE COCONUTS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT MIGHT WORK WELL SINCE IT ONLY COMES WITH MONKEYS YOU WOULD JUST NEED TO DIVIDE THE TEAMS AS NEEDED PROBABLY PAIR UP THE ADULTS WITH THE YOUNGEST KIDS AND HAVE THE OLDER KIDS PAIR UP WITH EACH OTHER

I HAVEN'T TRIED IT WITH KIDS BUT I THINK TELESTRATIONS MIGHT WORK WELL THE ART SKILLS OF MOST OF MY FRIENDS AND MINE HAVE NOT DEVELOPED TOO MUCH SINCE WE WERE CHILDREN ALSO IT MIGHT BE HILARIOUS TO SEE HOW A YOUNGER CHILD MIGHT INTERPRET A DRAWING AS TO AN OLDER OR EVEN AN ADULTS
CAMEL UP IS THE ONLY GAME I KNOW OF THAT I WOULD PLAY WITH KIDS AND CAN HANDLE UP TO PLAYERS

IT IS EASY TO LEARN EASY TO PLAY SUPER FUN AND PLAYS IN UNDER AN HOUR ALTHOUGH FULL DISCLOSURE I HAVE NEVER PLAYED IT WITH A FULL PEOPLE ONCE YOU GET PASSED THE NO YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE CAMELS ASPECT IT IS AN EXCELLENT GATEWAY GAME FOR AMY AGE
TRY RHINO HERO YOU WILL BE AMAZED ON THE SUCCESS THIS LITTLE AND CHEAP GAME HAS ON GROUPS
I REC SUSHI GO PARTY IT WILL NOT BRING BACK MTG DRAFTING FLASHBACKS WE JUST INTRODUCED IT TO A GROUP OF FOUR KIDS AND FOUR ADULTS EVEN WITH THE FULL EIGHT IT RAN SMOOTH


I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY TWO SETS OF DR EUREKA FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHT PLAYERS JUST COMBINE THE SETS YOU REALLY JUST NEED THE EXTRA TEST TUBES AND CAN EVEN ENTERTAIN MANY MORE WITH ENOUGH EXTRA SETS


TELESTRATIONS CAN BE VERY FRUSTRATING FOR THE KIDS OME BETTER TO JUST HAVE THEM PLAY A KID ONLY GAME AND HAVE SOME ADULT GAME TIME SEPARATELY


ETA ER REMOVE A DOUBLED HIGHLY I GUESS I AM REALLY INTO MY RECOMMENDATIONS TONIGHT
SNAKE OIL CAN PLAY A LOT OF PEOPLE THE YOUNGER ONES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PITCH IDEAS THAT WELL BUT STILL FUN NONETHELESS
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF
THIS GUY IS GREAT SUBSCRIBED
IT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY AWESOME GLADIATOR GAME

BUT THAT PRICE POINT FOR ONLY CHARACTERS IF IT WAS DOUBLE THAT THEN I WOULD CONSIDER IT A GOOD PURCHASE
REALLY FUN GAME LOVELY DETAIL ON THE MINIATURES I DO AGREE REGARDING THE BOARD BUT IF SOMEONE TRULY DESIRES IT THEY CAN CREATE ONE W SCENERY AND AUDIENCE ETC LIKE PEOPLE HAVE DONE OVER THE YEARS WITH BLOOD BOWL CERTAIN THIS CASE IS NOT AS INTENSE AS A BLOOD BOWL LEAGUE BUT HEY LOBBYING FTW

I MAY END UP GETTING THIS JUST TO PORT THE CHARACTERS INTO AGE OF SIGMA FOR A SLIGHTLY BETTER PRICE I'VE ENJOYED MANY OF NEW BOXES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I'M SURE I'D ENJOY THIS ONE BUT THE DOWNTIME FROM PLAYER ELIMINATION BUGS ME A BIT NO ONE IN MY GROUP IS GOING TO WANT TO SIT AROUND THE TABLE AND WATCH OTHERS PLAY FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES
ANIS ALL THE WAY GORGEOUS GAME AND ALSO REALLY REALLY GOOD WE GOT IT TO THE TABLE THE OTHER NIGHT AND PLAYED IT TWICE FIRST GAME WENT LONG DUE TO US GETTING THE RULES AND GENERAL STRATEGY DOWN THEN THE SECOND WAS FINISHED IN MINUTES OR SO AFTER WE FINISHED WE ALL HAD A COLLECTIVE YEAH THIS GAME IS AWESOME MOMENT IT WILL DEFINITELY BE IN OUR GROUP AVES
I THINK ABYSS STILL STANDS OUT FOR ME AMAZING ARTWORK ON TOP OF A REALLY GOOD GAME
I'M NOT SURE IF CGS ARE YOUR THING OR NOT BUT ASHES RISE OF THE PHOENIXBORN HAS REALLY GOOD ART AND VISUAL DESIGN IT IS STILL VERY CCC ART FANTASY MONSTERS AND WHATNOT BUT DONE ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT COULD POSSIBLY GET AND ALSO VERY CONSISTENT WHICH IS A HUGE PLUS FOR ME

IT'S A BIT BUSY BUT SEASONS AND LORDS OF AIDIT ALSO HAVE QUITE NICE ART AND PRESENTATION ABOVE AND BELOW LOTUS BIG BOOK OF MADNESS
DIXIT HAS SOME AMAZING ABSTRACT ART AND IT'S A SOLID PARTY GAME
I DON'T STRICTLY RECOMMEND THE GAME BUT THE BEST LOOKING GAME I OWN IS PROBABLY SUPER DUNGEON EXPLORE FORGOTTEN KING IT LOOKS SO BURSTING WITH ENERGY AND LIFE

ALSO SHOUT OUT TO MILLENNIUM BLADES FOR LOOKING PRETTY GOOD WHILE HAVING PROBABLY THE MOST ART OF ANY SINGLE GAME ALL DRAWN BY ONE GUY

FINAL SHOUT OUT TO FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE FOR ITS AWESOME NONEXISTENT ART DESIGN
I PLAYED A CARD GAME RECENTLY CALLED CONTROL IT WAS A KICKSTARTER FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR THE ARTWORK IS AMAZING
PROJECTS KEYMASTERGAMES

IT'S PRINTED USING ONLY COLORS AND 2 OF THEM ARE METALLIC GOLD AND METALLIC SILVER INKS THE ARTWORK HAS A COMIC BOOK STYLE WITH VERY STARK LINES STUNNING

SMASH UP HAS SOME REALLY NICE ARTWORK AS WELL I COULD STARE AT SOME OF THE CARDS ALL DAY THEY'RE NICE AND HAVE A PAINTERLY LOOK TO THEM
I WOULD SAY VALERIA CARD KINGDOMS IS A BEAUTIFUL LIGHTWEIGHT AND FUN GAME

LET US KNOW WHAT YOU DECIDE ON

IN WHICH CHAPTER DOES THIS HAPPEN
DOES ANYONE ELSE
IS THAT REALLY THE NAME OF THE HAUNT
THIS PROBABLY ISN'T WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT IF YOUR SON LOVES MAKING HIS OWN GAMES YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HELPING HIM PUT TOGETHER A PROTOTYPING KIT IT'S NOTHING FANCY IT CAN START WITH SEVERAL PACKS OF NOTE CARDS PLASTIC CARD SLEEVES MARKERS GRID PAPER CHIPBOARD I SAVE ALL OF MY CEREAL BOXES RULERS VARIOUS TYPES OF CUTTING TOOLS AND TONS AND TONS OF FUN LITTLE WIDGETS YOU CAN ORDER BULK BAGS OF MEEDLESS AND WOODEN CUBES AND YOU CAN WALK INTO DOLLAR STORES AND CRAFT SHOPS AND FIND LOTS OF THINGS THAT CAN SPARK A CREATIVE MIND SOME FOLKS LIKE TO RAID CHARITY SHOPS AND YARD SALES FOR GAMES TO CANNIBALIZE FOR COMPONENTS EVERYTHING FROM DICE TO PAWNS TO CHIPS TO LITTLE PEWTER SCOTTY DOGS

ON TOP OF THAT THERE ARE SOME PRODUCTS AVAILABLE THAT ARE MARKETED AS COMPONENTS THEY CAN BE USED FOR DOZENS AND DOZENS OF GAMES LIKE THE WAY A POKER DECK ALSO CALLED A STANDARD FRENCH DECK OR STANDARD CARD DECK OR DOMINOES ARE THEY ARE OFTEN CLEVERLY DESIGNED WITH SOLID STATISTICAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT CAN GIVE YOU LOTS OF NEAT WAYS TO EXPERIMENT WITH YOUR OWN DESIGNS WITHOUT HAVING TO DO STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS OR SPEND HOURS COLORING ON CARDS HERE ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS

LOONEY PYRAMIDS PYRAMID ARCADE THE PYRAMIDS COME IN THREE NESTING SIZES AND MANY DIFFERENT COLORS WITH A FEW STASHES OF PYRAMIDS AND SOME GLASS BEADS OR A DECK OF CARDS YOU CAN PLAY HUNDREDS OF GAMES AND EASILY COME UP WITH YOUR OWN THESE ARE GREAT WAYS TO EXPLORE DESIGNING GAMES AND FINDING INSPIRATION THE PYRAMID ARCADE IS A BOX THAT CONTAINS A LOT OF GREATEST HITS ALONG WITH LOTS OF FUN COMPONENTS THAT WORK WELL TOGETHER AND CAN BE USED TO PLAY WITH NEW CONCEPTS AND DESIGNS

PIECEPACK THE INFINITE BOARD GAME PIECEPACK IS A SIMILAR TOOLSHED PIECEPACK IS TO BOARDGAMES AS POKER DECKS ARE TO CARD GAMES OR AT LEAST THAT'S THEIR ANGLE IT'S ESSENTIALLY A SPECIFICATION THE LAYS OUT THE TYPES AND VALUES OF THE PIECES SO ANYONE CAN MAKE THEIR OWN THE INFINITE BOARD GAME IS A SOMEWHAT SPOTTY MASS MARKET VERSION THAT YOU CAN FIND ON AMAZON OR AT BARNES AND NOBLE

DECKERT NON-FRENCH DECKS OF CARDS I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF DECKS OF CARDS OUT THERE THAT AREN'T THE STANDARD CARD SUIT RANK DECKS MOST FOLKS KNOW TAROT DECKS ARE A LOT OF FUN TO PLAY WITH AND HAVE A LONG HISTORY MOST PRINTING COMPANIES THAT PRINT BOARD GAMES USE STANDARD DIES THAT CUT CARDS PRINTED TO A SHEET YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MANY GAMES ON THE MARKET CAN BE FAIRLY EASILY BROKEN DOWN INTO A SUIT RANK CARD STRUCTURE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE DESIGNER STARTED WITH A DECK OF PLAYING CARDS AND A MARKER

BLANK GAME BOARDS AFTER YOU MOVE BEYOND DRAWING ON GRAPH PAPER YOU CAN GO TO A BOARD LIKE THIS MOST OF THEM HAVE A GLOSSY FINISH THAT YOU CAN OFTEN GET AWAY WITH GREASE PENCIL OR EVEN DRY WET ERASE MARKERS I CAN'T SPECIFICALLY VOUCH FOR THE ONE LINKED

BUT REALLY FOR MANY PEOPLE THE FIRST BIT OF DESIGNING A GAME IS ABOUT HAVING AN IDEA AND ENOUGH STUFF AT HAND TO VERY RAPIDLY GET THE IDEA OUT OF YOUR HEAD AND ONTO THE TABLE I COUNSEL THE GAME DESIGN MERIT BADGE FOR SCOUTS AND IT'S SUPER FUN TO CUT A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE LOOSE ON A TABLE COVERED IN COMPONENTS THAT ARE BRISTLING WITH POSSIBILITY
YOU COULD LOOK AT JUNK ART ITS A GAME WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF COLORFUL PIECES AND EVEN IN THE GAME THERE ARE A FEW WAYS TO PLAY WITH THEM AND YOUR KID COULD EASILY COME UP WITH NEW GAMES USING THE PIECES ALSO THEY ARE ALL WOODEN AND THEY LOOK COOL
LEGO MAKES A FEW BOARD GAMES WHERE YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO ALTER THE GAME AS YOU WISH I HAVE THE LEGO PYRAMID GAMES
THIS
UH

U GETINFO
IN MY GAMES DEVELOPMENT INTRODUCTION CLASS OUR PROFESSOR GAVE US A PROJECT TO MAKE OUR OWN GAME PROTOTYPE THROUGH A PEN AND PAPER PROTOTYPE ANYTHING GOES BUT MUST BE MADE WITH A4 PIECES OF PAPER AND NOT PRINTED

IF YOUR KID IS MORE OF A STORYTELLER I FIND THAT EXPOSING HIM TO THE OLD CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE BOOKS A GREAT PATHWAY TO INTRODUCE NARRATIVE AND CHOICE STRUCTURE
ON BOARDGAMEGEEK THERE IS A SUB CALLED SOMETHING LIKE GAMES IN THE CLASSROOM THERE IS A WOMAN IN THAT GUILD WHO TEACHES GAME DESIGN AT HER SCHOOL ALL HER STUDENTS MAKE GAMES AND SHE PHOTOGRAPHS THEM AND PUTS THEM IN THE GUILD WITH A DESCRIPTION I MENTION THIS BECAUSE THE GAMES ARE MADE WITH PAPER AND MARKERS AND SOME PIECES LIKE DICE OR BEADS I MENTION IT CAUSE IF YOU CHECK IT OUT IF YOU FIND HER POSTS YOU CAN MAYBE HAVE YOUR CHILD DRAW INSPIRATION FROM IT AND SEE THAT YOU DON'T NEED THE PROFESSIONAL PIECES FOR A GAME MAYBE JUST PURCHASE THOSE PIECES ONCE YOU HAVE A FUNCTIONING GAME YOU LIKE
COVERT NOT A BIG FAN TOO MANY MOVING PARTS AND SUPERFLUOUS MECHANICS THIS GAME IS ALSO MY NOMINEE FOR THE STUFFING QUESTION POSED ABOVE

DOMINION I PLAYED THIS ONE A FEW TIMES A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND IT DIDN'T STRIKE ME AS MEMORABLE JUST KIND OF MIDDLE OF THE ROAD I'M CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH MY COLLECTION TO GET RID OF SOME GAMES AND CAME TO THIS WE PLAYED IT IN AN EFFORT TO SEE IF IT'S A KEEPER OR NOT IT WAS FUN ENOUGH THAT I THINK I'LL HOLD ON TO IT FOR A WHILE I HEAR THIS GETS BETTER WITH EXPANSIONS SO IF ANYONE HAS SUGGESTIONS FOR THE BEST ONES LET ME KNOW

PATCHWORK LOVED IT THE BALANCE OF INCOME AND FILLING YOUR QUILT IS A TOUGH ONE TO MASTER I LOOK FORWARD TO A LOT MORE OF THIS GAME
I'VE BEEN AWAY WITH MY FAMILY FOR A LONG WEEKEND AND WAS ABLE TO INTRODUCE THEM TO

MONOPOLY DEAL

NO THANKS

SEVEN DRAGONS

COCKROACH POKER

UNDER MY BED

THOSE ARE IN ORDER OF ROUGH PREFERENCE DEAL HAS PROVED TO BE A BIG HIT WITH NO THANKS GOOD AT FIRST BUT THEN TIRING OF IT EVENTUALLY MY MUM LIKES SEVEN DRAGONS FAR MORE THAN MY BROTHER WHO STRUGGLED TO GET HIS HEAD ROUND IT

COCKROACH POKER I THINK NEEDS A FEW MORE PEOPLE TO REALLY GET GOING AND UNDER MY BED DEFINITELY LIKE SPYFAULT YOU CAN OFTEN GUESS IN THE FIRST TURN BASED ON THE QUESTION AND ANSWER

QUESTIONS


I'M THANKFUL FOR DISCOVERING THIS HOBBY YEARS AGO IT'S TRULY BEEN LIFE CHANGING I'VE MET SO MANY GREAT PEOPLE











SPACE ALERT BEEN A FREQUENT ONE FOR US RECENTLY IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BEFORE IT'S A REAL-TIME CO-OP PROGRAMMING GAME YOU HAVE MINUTES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STAY ALIVE IN A SPACESHIP WITH ALL KINDS OF BAD STUFF THAT CAN HAPPEN WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR A GROUP OF OR PEOPLE

CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THIS GAME JUST GETS BETTER WITH EVERY WITH 2 PEOPLE IT IS JUST A JOY NO WONDER IT IS RANKED SO HIGHLY ON BG IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO GETS SEVERE ANALYSIS PARALYSIS I'D STEER CLEAR THOUGH THERE ARE TONS OF POSSIBLE DECISIONS EVERY TURN

ALSO WE ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR ALL OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO GATHER AROUND ESPECIALLY AT THANKSGIVING AND PLAY TOGETHER FRIENDS WHO GAME TOGETHER STAY TOGETHER
BATTLE FOR SOLARIA WE HAD PLAY TESTING FOR THE NEXT RELEASE COMING THIS SPRING

MACHS VS MINIONS PLAYED MISSION THREE I BELIEVE IT WAS

BLOODBOURNE GOOD LITTLE LANG GAME BUT NOT MY FAVORITE

STAR WARS DESTINY PLAYED IN THE

POMPEII WRATH OF VESUVIUS GOOD AREA CONTROL GAME WE ARE PUBLISHING

MYSTIC VALE MIGHT BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE TABLEAU GAMES
THIS WEEK WAS SO I PLAYED A TON OF GAMES THOUGH NOT AS MANY AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED

THE FLOW OF HISTORY IT KEEPS GETTING BETTER EVERY TIME I PLAY THE SNIPING MECHANISM IS MADDENING AND BRILLIANT YOU CAN NEVER AFFORD TO STOP TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR OPPONENTS ARE TRYING TO DO WHICH TO ME IS A HALLMARK OF A GREAT GAME
COLONY MACHI BORO ONLY FUN IT'S AGE OF CRAFT WITH THE BROKEN STUFF FIXED A SEEMINGLY LIGHT GAME THAT IS FULL OF DECISIONS THAT ARE NOT ONLY HARD BUT COMPUTATIONALLY HARD WHICH MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO BY FEEL A LOT OF THE TIME LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THIS ONE A LOT
PYRAMIDES ONE OF MANY HABA DEXTERITY KIDS GAMES WE PLAYED THIS ONE INVOLVES POKING A MARBLE OUT OF A HOLE IN THE BOARD AND TRYING TO ROLL IT TOWARDS ANOTHER AND WAS WAY MORE FUN THAN THAT SOUNDS ITS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE ENDGAME CONDITION GET ONE MARBLE RESTING ATOP A BASE OF FOUR OTHERS BY POKING IT INTO THE AIR FROM UNDERNEATH TURNED OUT TO NOT BE TOO IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ACHIEVE I AM MIGHTY
LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT SIMILAR TO GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL WITH THE SPATIAL COMPONENT SWAPPED OUT FOR PURE ENGINE BUILDING DEFINITELY WORTH PLAYING AGAIN THOUGH IT'S NOT A GAME I FEEL THE NEED TO OWN
PONZI SCHEME THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE BMG EDITION IS EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL THE BAD NEWS IS THAT THE GROUP I WAS WITH DIDN'T REALLY GET IT AND ONE PERSON RAN HIMSELF VERY LOW ON MONEY WHILE ANOTHER PUSHED THE END OF THE GAME EVEN THOUGH SHE WASN'T WINNING WELL THAT HAPPENED
MOZART UNSPEAKABLY BAD I THINK IT WOULD BE A BAD GAME EVEN IF THE RULES HAD BEEN WRITTEN PROPERLY BEFORE THEY WERE INTO ENGLISH I REALLY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY THIS GAME EVEN EXISTS
PICK ME UP A SPEED REACTION PERCEPTION GAME DESIGNED FOR KOREAN SCHOOLCHILDREN WHO ARE SELF-EVIDENTLY FASTER AND MORE PERCEPTIVE THAN AMERICAN ADULTS QUITE FUN ESPECIALLY WITH THE SQUEAKER SUCTION CUP THINGS THAT YOU USE TO EITHER PICK UP THE MATCHING TILES OR SIGNAL THAT YOU DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY LEFT
DALE OF MERCHANTS 2 REALLY REALLY UNUSUAL GAME OPAQUE FOR MOST OF OUR ONE PLAY EVEN MORE SO THAN VALLEY OF THE KINGS WAS AT FIRST I'LL BE GETTING THIS AND THE ORIGINAL
LETTER TYCOON PRETTY GOOD GAME WITH LOVELY AND WEIRD INDUSTRIAL ARTICLE TOO MUCH DOWNTIME DON'T PLAY IT WITH
UNFAIR WELL THEY TOLD YOU IT WAS UNFAIR MECHANICALLY INTERESTING GAME WITH WHAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF AVENUES TO VICTORY BUT A SURFEIT OF MECHANISMS PERHAPS IF IT TOOK MINUTES TO PLAY WE'D HAVE BEEN HAPPIER WITH THE ARBITRARINESS OF THE ENDGAME BUT AT THAT IT WAS NOT A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE THE RULEBOOK IS ALTOGETHER MORE PLEASED WITH ITSELF THAN IT DESERVES TO BE
ICE COOL ENTERTAINING DEXTERITY GAME AND ONE THAT I'M SURE ONE CAN GET VERY SKILLED AT THOUGH GOD KNOWS NONE OF US WERE THE WOBBLING PENGUINS ARE CLEVER AND PRODUCE FUNNY RESULTS VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT SCORING MECHANISMS THE NAME IS A PUN SO CLEVER WE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT WAS A PUN UNTIL WE WERE PUTTING IT AWAY
IMAGINE I SUPPOSE YOU COULD CALL THIS A CONCEPT KILLER IF CONCEPT NEEDED KILLING THE ABILITY TO COMBINE SYMBOLS DIRECTLY INSTEAD OF BY REFERENCE IS FOR SURE A REAL IMPROVEMENT AND UNLIKE CONCEPT IT SEEMED TO WORK WELL AS A GAME ONE OF US CAME UP WITH A CONCEPT TAKE A CARD AND SOLVE AS MANY WORDS ON IT AS YOU CAN IN THREE MINUTES THAT MADE THE LAST ROUND SUPER FUN
JUNK ART THE BEST BUILDING GAME YOU CAN BUY RIGHT NOW IT'S BASICALLY AN ITERATION ON BAUSACK ONLY THE PROLIFERATION OF POSSIBLE PLAY MODES HAS BEEN TURNED FROM A VAGUE BUG INTO A DEFINING FEATURE AS YOU CHOOSE THREE SETS OF RULES AT RANDOM AND ACCUMULATE YOUR SCORE ACROSS ALL THREE THE BLOCKS ARE REALLY WELL DESIGNED SOME BLOCKS FIT TOGETHER PERFECTLY OTHERS REALLY REALLY DON'T AND THE USE OF CARDS AND COLORS PROVIDE ALL KINDS OF INTERESTING WAYS TO CONTROL WHICH PIECES GET PLAYED NEXT AND BY WHOM THERE ARE SPEED GAMES BIDDING GAMES GAMES AND IT ALL WORKS
CAPITAL SOLID GAME PROBABLY THE BEST GAME I PLAYED IT'S CERTAINLY THE ONLY GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED WHERE YOU DISCARD ONE TILE FOR WWI AND THEN TWO TILES FOR WWII THE RULES ARE A BIT VAGUE AND THE ICONOGRAPHY NEEDS TO BE MORE EXPLICIT SO IF YOU GET A HOLD OF THIS LOOK UP FACS ONLINE BEFORE YOU PLAY THIS REALLY GOOD

RAILROAD REVOLUTION PRETTY INTERESTING OPTIMIZATION PUZZLE TYPE OF EURO I LOVE WORKER PLACEMENTS WITH VARIABLE WORKER POWER SO THIS IS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY WILL DEFINITELY BE PLAYING THIS AGAIN

LORENZO IL MAGNIFICO LOVE HOW TENSE THE GAME GETS AND HOW THAT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT I'M NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT ALL THE CARDS COMING OUT EVERY GAME THOUGH WILL GIVE THIS A FEW MORE TRIES BEFORE DECIDING

CLANK MY FAVORITE BOARD GAME AT THE MOMENT
TRAJAN THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR THERE ARE SO SO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS TO THINK ABOUT THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF CHOOSING ACTIONS TAKES ABOUT LAYERS OF THINKING WITH THAT SAID IT'S PRETTY EASY TO LEARN AND A SOMEWHAT QUICK PLAY FOR THE AMOUNT OF DEPTH IT PRESENTS

YINS AMAZING ABSTRACT STRATEGY GAME THIS AND AHRIMAN ARE MY TWO FAVORITE ABSTRACTS I LOVE HOW THIS GAME FORCES YOU TO CONSTANTLY READJUST YOUR PLAN SINCE YOUR OPPONENT CAN USUALLY MESS YOU UP IN ABOUT 2 MOVES VERY FUN VERY QUICK EASY TO LEARN HARD TO MASTER
DUNGEON PETZ I FEEL THE GAME IS A BIT TOO CROWDED WE ARE ALL BEGINNERS AT THE GAME AND STILL BAD A STRATEGY BUT I FEEL THAT SOME SPOTS LIKE THE SELLING PLATFORM ARE JUST TOO CONTESTED WITH SO MANY PLAYERS

AFTER THAT WE PLAYED THREE ROUNDS OF BASE DOMINION MAN FEELS LIKE I HAVENT PLAYED IT IN YEARS I DON'T MIND IT BUT IT FEELS A LITTLE LACKLUSTER THESE DAYS I FORGET HOW FIDDLY IT IS TO SETUP WITH THE RANDOMIZER COMPARATIVELY TO PLAY TIME AFTER SETTING PACKING AFF EVEN EVEN WHEN ITS A LONGER GAME WITH AVERAGE ACTION CARDS IT SEEMS TO DRAG BUT STILL JUST ENJOYED PLAYING AND SOCIALISING

SO I PLAYED 2 SOLO GAMES OF AFF AND MY SCORES WERE AND THEN SCORE WAS
THE PRIORITIES SHIFT GREATLY BETWEEN THE TWO PLAYER COUNTS IN THE MOUNTAIN RESOURCES WERE STRIPPED ALL THE TIME AT THE START THEN UPGRADING WAS CONSTANTLY TAKEN IN SOLO I COULD ALTERNATE BETWEEN HUNTING TRAPPING RESOURCE GATHERING AND UPGRADING EXPLORING DEVELOPING REALLY ENJOYED BOTH ASPECTS OF THE GAME AND CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY MORE

DEAD OF WINTER THE LONG NIGHT X PLAYED THE RAXXON INTRODUCTION SCENARIO AND HOLY CRAP EVERY TURN FELT LIKE WE WERE JUST ON THE EDGE OF FAILING AND WHEN THE SPECIAL RAXXON ZOMBIES CAME OUT IT PUSHED US RIGHT OFF THE CLIFF INTO THE SPIKY PIT OF DEATH BELOW STILL HAD A TON OF FUN WITH IT IT'LL DEFINITELY BE SEEING MORE PLAY IN THE FUTURE

I'M THANKFUL I HAVE A HOBBY THAT I CAN USE AS AN EXCUSE TO BRING PEOPLE OVER AND HAVE FUN I WASN'T MUCH FOR HOSTING EVENTS AT MY PLACE BEFORE BUT NOW I HAVE A MONTHLY EVENT AT MY PLACE

2 I TOUCHED ON THIS BUT I THINK WELCOME BACK TO THE DUNGEON IS RIGHT ON THE EDGE IF THEY DID A WELCOME BACK TO THE DUNGEON AGAIN TM I'D PROBABLY PASSIVE
BETRAYAL HOUSE ON THE HILL FINALLY GOT IT TO THE TABLE WE PLAYED IT ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A BIG TABLE HAD A LOT OF FUN I BECAME THE BETRAYER IN AND NARROWLY WON EVEN GOT MY DAD TO PLAY WITH US DON'T THINK HES EVER PLAYED A GAME LIKE THAT HE SAID HE LIKED IT WE ALSO PLAYED SABOTEUR 2 AND BONANZA
LIFEBOAT WHICH WAS QUIRKY BUT DIDN'T REALLY ROUSE MY FANCY

UNSPEAKABLE WORDS WHERE GOING INSANE HAS SOME POSITIVES I WON THE GAME WHILE INSANE AND ROLLING FOR A WORD OVER POINTS


I BOUGHT ELDRITCH HORROR WHICH I'LL PROBABLY BE PLAYING SOLO I REALLY LIKE IT SO FAR AFTER ONE GAME AND STARTING A SECOND
LOOKING AT MARKHAM HORROR CG NOW TOO BUT IF I GO FOR IT IT WILL DEFINITELY PUSH BACK MY PLAYING THE LOAR CG WHICH I HAVE BARELY TOUCHED
WE HAD A FRIENDSGIVING AND PLAYED SOME PARTY SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES


SPYFAULT PLAYERS PEOPLE WERE JOINING AND LEAVING AND THEN NEW PEOPLE WERE COMING SO WE JUST PLAYED MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF THIS GAME IT'S A RELATIVELY EASY GAME THAT PEOPLE PICKED UP ON QUICKLY SOME WERE ABLE TO ASK BETTER QUESTIONS SOONER THAN OTHERS BUT BY MAYBE THE THIRD GAME OR SO EVERYBODY COULD BALANCE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF VAGUE AND SPECIFIC IN THEIR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WE IMPLEMENTED A HOUSE RULE FOR WHEN WE HAD A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE WE ASK IN A CIRCLE FIRST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY GETS ASKED AT LEAST ONE QUESTION WITHIN THE MINUTES I THINK THE SPY ALWAYS WON IN OUR ROUNDS BUT THE GAME WAS STILL FUN IT INVOKED THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SHOUTING AND DEBATING


SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM PLAYERS APPARENTLY MY FRIENDS AND I JUST LOVE LYING TO EACH OTHER WE PLAYED THIS ONE BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST GAME WE HAD BRINGING FOOD AND OR DRINKS INTO NOTTINGHAM AND REALLY IT WAS JUST AN EXCUSE TO PLAY THE GAME MANY OF US PLAY THE GAME TO THROW IN CHAOS RATHER THAN FOCUS ON WINNING SO IT MADE THE GAME FUN WHEN WE HAD LIARS AND SMUGGLERS THE WINNERS WERE ALWAYS THE ONES WHO PLAYED IT STRAIGHT THOUGH


SPECIAL MENTIONS I HAD KICKSTARTED AND ADDED ON AVIGNON A CLASH OF POPES AND THEY ARRIVED THIS WEEK I HADN'T PLAYED A REAL GAME OF IT BUT MY SO AND I DID A TO LEARN THE RULES LOVING THE PORTABLE POCKET-SIZED CASES THAT THEY COME IN





I AM THANKFUL THAT HAVING GAME NIGHTS HAS MADE ME A BETTER PRESENTER AT WORK I DID A POST A FEW DAYS AGO ABOUT HOW I HAD TO EXPLAIN MY RESEARCH STUDY TO SOME REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR SPONSORS AND I FOUND THAT IT WAS SIMILAR TO INTRODUCING A NEW BOARD GAME TO MY FRIENDS


I'M STILL TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY CRIMSON CREEK BUT I'M FINDING THAT I HAVE TOO MANY LITTLE TRINKETS IN THE TIN I APPRECIATE THAT THE CREATOR OF THE GAME WAS TRYING TO GIVE ME THE MOST BANG FOR MY BUCK BUT I ENDED UP FEELING CONFUSED KODAMA ALSO HAD THESE LITTLE SPIRITS THAT YOU CAN HANG ON YOUR TREE THAT YOU BUILT IF YOU WIN THE GAME BUT IT WAS UNNECESSARY
TICKET TO RIDE EUROPE I'VE ONLY EVER PLAYED VANILLA TR AND ONLY ON THE APPARENTLY IT WAS OK I PREFER THE BASIC ONE THE LUCK OF LAYING TUNNELS ANNOYED ME AS I GOT BURNT A COUPLE OF TIMES

PORT ROYAL MANAGED TO ACHIEVE MY LOWEST EVER SCORE OF GOT HIT BY TAX A COUPLE OF TIMES AND NEVER REALLY GOT GOING

BEAST BAR FIRST GO AT THIS AND IT WAS PRETTY FUN ONLY REALLY GOT THE HANG OF WHAT ALL THE CARDS DID BY THE END NEED TO PLAY AGAIN

MAGE KNIGHT LOVED THIS BOUGHT AT THE WEEKEND AS I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT PLAYS SOLO AND YOU CAN GET YOUR TEETH INTO FIRST TIME PLAYING THIS SPENT MY SATURDAY LEARNING THE RULES WHICH TOOK TIME BUT THE RULE BOOKS ARE GOOD AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF ON YOUTUBE THEN DID THE FIRST INTRO MISSION THEN ON SUNDAY DID THE FIRST SOLO CAMPAIGN TOOK ABOUT BEAT ONE CITY AND REACHED THE SECOND BUT RAN OUT OF TIME AND WAS SEVERELY UNDERPOWERED NEED TO PLAY AGAIN AND DO IT BETTER THIS TIME GOING TO TRY AND PLAY THIS AS MUCH AS I CAN THEN MIGHT TRY AND TEMPT SOMEONE FOR A COOP ONCE I KNOW THE RULES INSIDE OUT
PATHFINDER ACS MUMMY'S MASK CHARACTERS MORE OF THE SAME BUT A REFRESHING CHANGE FROM HUGE NUMBERS AND OVERPOWERED CHARACTERS

PANDEMIC THE CURE THEN BUT ALWAYS CHARACTERS 2 WINS AND LOSSES AND WE PLAY REGULAR PANDEMIC WITH ITS EXPANSIONS A LOT STILL FIGURING THIS ONE OUT BUT IT'S HARD TO COME BACK FROM THE MEDIC ROLLING BIOHAZARDS AT THE START

WARHAMMER QUEST ADVENTURE CARD GAME INTRODUCED 2 FRIENDS TO THIS GAME AND ONE LIKED IT SO MUCH HE BOUGHT IT BEFORE IT GOES OUT OF PRINT HAVE PLAYED IT MANY TIMES PREVIOUSLY AND IT'S A SHAME THIS GAME IS DISCONTINUED IT'S MECHANICALLY VERY CLEAN
CLANK LOVED THE GAME REALLY CAN'T GO WRONG WITH DECK BUILDING WITH ME

CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD WORKER PLACEMENT ANOTHER MECHANIC I LOVE WHILE I LIKED THE GAME I FELT THAT IT KINDA FILLS THE SAME NICHE AS LORDS OF WATERDEEP AND I WOULD RATHER PLAY THE LATTER

THE BIG BOOK OF MADNESS ANOTHER DECK BUILDING SO I OBVIOUSLY ENJOYED THOUGH IT FEELS ALMOST LIKE A FILLER

TERRA MYSTIC I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT THIS ONE I HAVE OVER GAMES PLAYED ONLINE OF TM SO I'M QUITE BIASED IN FAVOR OF IT

CELESTIA BEAUTIFUL GAME AND FUN LITTLE FILLER NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT IT

POTION EXPLOSION FUN LITTLE GAME THOUGH TO ME MOST OF THE FUN IS GIMMICKY FROM THE CHAIN EXPLOSIONS BUT THERE IS SOME DEPTH OF STRATEGY ESPECIALLY WHEN TO TAKE THE PROFESSOR'S FAVOR WHICH IMO IS ALMOST ALWAYS HAHA

SKULL FUN FILLER THE GAME ENDED WITH EVERYBODY GETTING ELIMINATED I GUESS THAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT MY GROUP OF PEOPLE BUT IT WAS INTENSE AT THE END THE 2 LAST PLAYERS BOTH HAD ONE POINT BUT ONLY CARD LEFT

WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE 2 DAYS OF BOARDGAMES THIS WEEK WHICH IS AWESOME
LAS VEGAS NEVER PLAYED THIS ONE BEFORE IT'S MOSTLY DICE BASED WITH SOME BETTING AND STRATEGY INVOLVED LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR GRUDGES BUT IT'S A VERY QUICK GAME

LORDS OF WATERDEEP ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES WE PLAYED WITH PEOPLE AND 2 OF THEM HADN'T PLAYED BEFORE AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO PICK UP ON I DO NOTICE THAT IT'S EASY TO FORGET STUFF AT THE START OF ROUNDS SINCE THE KIND OF STUFF IN PLAY CAN VARY FROM GAME TO GAME WE HAD A LOT OF BUILDINGS WITH THE AT THE START OF THE ROUND CONDITIONS AND SOMETIMES WE'D MISS THEM REALLY GOTTA KEEP TRACK OF THEM

GOBBLE GOBBLE THANKFUL FOR HAVING A GREAT OUTLET TO HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS
MARGI WOW WHAT A FANTASTIC LITTLE GAME I REALLY LOVE ITS TWIST ON WORKER PLACEMENT MECHANICS THIS GAME FITS THE BILL FOR TIMES WHEN WE HAVE THE ITCH TO PLAY AN EURO GAME BUT DON'T FEEL LIKE INVESTING IN THE HOURS AND MENTAL FORTITUDE REQUIRED OF A FULL GAME

TUSCANY EE MY WIFE AND I ALREADY LOVE VITICULTURE AND WE DIDN'T THINK THE GAME COULD GET ANY BETTER WE WERE WRONG THIS EXPANSION ADDS TO AN ALREADY GREAT GAME AND I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY MORE

FEAST FOR ODIN JUST RECEIVED MY COPY YESTERDAY PLAYED A ROUND OF SOLO GAME AND BELIEVE THE HYPE I CAN'T WAIT TO TEACH MY WIFE HOW TO PLAY I PREDICT THIS GAME WILL HIT THE TABLE VERY OFTEN

GOBBLE GOBBLE I'M THANKFUL TO BOARD GAMES BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ME TO BOND WITH MY WIFE AFTER WORK I LIKE TO KICK BACK AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES HOWEVER IN DOING SO I'D NEGLECTED MY WIFE SINCE SHE'S NOT INTO VIDEO GAMING I INTRODUCED HER TO BOARD GAMING AND I'M GLAD SHE ENJOYS IT AS MUCH AS I DO NOW WE HAVE AN ACTIVITY IN COMMON WHERE WE'RE BOTH ENJOYING WITH EACH OTHER
DEAD OF WINTER PLAYED THE TOO MANY MOUTHS SCENARIO AND GOT SO CLOSE TO WINNING BUT WE GOT COCKY AND CHOSE TO TAKE A MORALE HIT DURING A CROSSROADS CARD AND THEN DIDN'T MAKE THE FINAL CRISIS IT WAS DEVASTATING

SECRET HITLER FIRST TIME PLAYING THIS LIBERALS WON EASY THE FIRST GAME AND I UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO LEAVE AFTER JUST THE ONE HOPEFULLY I CAN SCOOP THIS UP ON ITS SECOND PRINTING

LOVE LETTER PERFECT GAME

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF THIS IS BECOMING SUCH A STANDBY FOR MY WIFE AND I WHENEVER WE HAVE TWO OR MORE PEOPLE OVER WE TAUGHT IT TO ANOTHER COUPLE AND AFTER JUST A COUPLE PRACTICE ROUNDS THEY WERE BLUFFING JUST AS WELL AS US BROUGHT A TEAR TO MY EYE

EDIT TOO TWO
I HAD A GAMING PARTY THIS PAST WEEKEND HAD ABOUT OF US AND WE PLAYED THE FOLLOWING NOT IN ANY ORDER

CODENAMES
2 BANG
BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL
COUP
SHERIF OF NOTTINGHAM
ECS VS MINIONS
BLOODBORNE
BURO

WAS A BLAST
SCYTHE FIRST FOUR PLAYER GAME OF SCYTHE I WAS SAXONY AND HAD A GOOD EARLY GAME BUT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE AND MAKE TWO NEW PLAYERS FRUSTRATED I DIDN'T ATTACK AT KEY TIMES WHEN I SHOULD HAVE I HAD MACHS WHEN ONLY ONE OTHER PLAYER HAD ONE MECH I ENDED UP LOSING BECAUSE I LOST ALL MOMENTUM THEN RUSHIEST STEAMROLLER USING WORKERS AND THEIR ECONOMY SAXONY IS A FUN FACTION BUT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE TO WIN NEXT TIME I WON'T GO EASY ON THEM

SMALLSWORD LOVE THIS GAME I HAVE PLAYED IT BEFORE BUT IT HAS BEEN A WHILE VERY INTERESTING WITH FOUR PLAYERS I'D RECOMMEND THE EXPANSION DUE TO HAVING MORE COMBINATIONS FUN FORGIVING EASY TO LEARN ENOUGH TACTICAL DEPTH TO REMAIN INTERESTING

DEAD OF WINTER EVEN WHILE THIS WAS MY MOST ENJOYABLE GAME OF DOW IT STILL DOESN'T GRAB ME AS MUCH AS I HAD HOPED WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT

STUFFING DOW MANAGES TO PAINT A WONDERFULLY BELIEVABLE AND MATURE APOCALYPSE IT'S JUST TOO BAD YOU DON'T GET TO EXPERIENCE IT ALL THAT MUCH THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OFTEN DICTATES THE DIRECTION TOO MUCH IMO WHILE LEAVING LITTLE IN THE WAY OF EXPLORING THE WONDERFUL ENCOUNTERS AND OTHER SCENARIOS THAT CAN HAPPEN THE MAIN OBJECTIVES CAN ALSO BE VERY UNINTUITIVE SUCH AS SITTING ON THE SAME TWO LOCATIONS AND DEPLETING THEIR ITEM DECKS THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD CALL FUN MANY OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES CAN BE ACHIEVED BY MOVING ALL CHARACTERS TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IN THE FIRST ROUND OF PLAY THEN SIMPLY COMPLETING THE NECESSARY ACTIONS TO WIN WITH MINOR MOVEMENTS HERE AND THERE MANY OF THE CHARACTERS ARE RELEGATED TO THE EXACT SAME SET OF TASKS EVERY ROUND SUCH AS THE COOK WHO CAN MAKE FOOD AND IS AN EXCELLENT DEFENDER OF THE COLONY AS WELL BUT THIS MEANS THAT THE PLAYER WHO HAS THE COOK MUST USE 2 OF THEIR DIE EVERY ROUND JUST DOING UPKEEP AND THEY DON'T GET TO EXPLORE THE GAME AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHY THAT PERSON EVEN NEEDS TO PLAY WHEN YOU COULD HAVE THEIR CHARACTER DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITHOUT ANYONE PLAYING THEM AT ALL WITHOUT GOING OVERBOARD I'LL JUST SAY THAT DOW COULD DO A LOT MORE TO GIVE INDIVIDUAL PLAYERS OPTIONS AND MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY ARE A PART OF THE GAME RATHER THAN MAKING THEM FEEL LIKE AN ACTION DIE DRONE RELEGATED TO THE SAME BS EVERY ROUND

GOBBLE GOBBLE I'M THANKFUL FOR THE ENDLESS HOURS OF ENJOYMENT BOARDGAMES HAVE BROUGHT ME WHILE BEING SOCIAL VIDEO GAMES ARE A SOLO VENTURE WHILE BOARDGAMES ARE A COMRADERY VENTURE
HAD A COUPLE FRIENDS OVER AND THEY BROUGHT ABOVE AND BELOW THAT WAS SOME GOOD FUN NICE COMBO OF SIMPLE AND STRATEGIC PLANABLE AND RANDOM

LATER THAT NIGHT I CLOBBERED MY PARTNER ON CARCASSONNE WE HAD THE TIME TO PLAY WITH INNS CATHEDRALS TRADERS BUILDERS AND THE HILLS SHEEP EXPANSIONS BOARD WAS GIGANTIC BY THE TIME WE FINISHED I'D MADE A RISK VERY EARLY IN THE GAME OF DROPPING A FARMER SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO GET ANY FARMERS IN THE SAME FIELD TO EVEN TIE UP WITH ME SO ALONG WITH THE PIG I ROCKED NEARLY POINTS JUST FROM ONE FARMER

I'M THANKFUL THAT BOARDGAMES GIVE ME A STRUCTURED INTERACTION I LIKE FRIENDS JUST FINE BUT I JUST DON'T VERY MUCH ENJOY ENDLESS CHATTER LAYING OUT A BOARDGAME PROVIDES THE PERFECT FOCUS AND A START AND END POINT


THIS WEEK I PLAYED A GAME OF DIXIT AND THEN THREE GAMES OF CODENAMES DIXIT THIS MAKES ME EAGER TO PICK UP CODENAMES PICTURES AT SOME POINT AS IT WAS DEFINITELY CHALLENGING BUT EQUALLY FUN TO MATCH PICTURES AS WORDS
COUP PLAYED A BUNCH OF ROUNDS WITH MY WIFE AND HER BEST FRIEND ON WEDNESDAY FIRST TIME PLAYING FOR HER FRIEND OUR SECOND TIME PLAYING MY WIFE WAS TIRED AND GOT CRABBY WHEN SHE DIDN'T WIN THE FIRST FEW SHE'S COMPETITIVE BUT THEN SHE GOT INTO IT WE ALL HAD A BLAST

LOST CITIES THE AFOREMENTIONED FRIEND OF MY WIFE BROUGHT THIS OVER IT WAS MY FIRST TIME PLAYING IT I READ THE RULES AND WASN'T EXPECTING MUCH BUT WHEN I STARTED PLAYING IT WAS ACTUALLY REALLY ENJOYABLE MORE STRATEGY AND MIND GAMES THAN I EXPECTED I'M NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF STAYING POWER IT WILL HAVE BUT I REALLY ENJOYED MAKING MY CHOICES IN THAT GAME

SPLENDOR IT'S A STANDBY AT THIS POINT I TRIED A NEW STRATEGY THIS WEEK OF HOARDING GEMS RESERVING POINT CARDS AND ONLY BUYING POINT CARDS I WON BY A LANDSLIDE GAME BUT I SUSPECT MY WIFE AT LEAST WILL CATCH ON TO THIS STRATEGY PRETTY QUICKLY BUT IT'S BEEN A FUN LITTLE CHANGE FOR NOW

MUNCHKIN TAUGHT THIS GAME TO MY YOUNG NEPHEW AND PLAYED IT WITH HIM AND MY TWO TEENAGE SISTERS GOOD SIMPLE FUN AND THE NEPHEW WON THE GAME WHICH WAS A GREAT THRILL FOR HIM

CATAN IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I PLAYED THIS ESPECIALLY WITH PLAYERS BUT WE ALL SETTLED IN COMFORTABLY AND HAD A GREAT CLOSE GAME I GOT LONGEST ROAD EARLY ON AND KEPT IT MY WIFE GOT LARGEST ARMY AND KEPT IT I HAD A LUCKY STREAK GETTING ACCESS TO SOME GOOD WOOL TILES AND BUILDING SEVERAL SETTLEMENTS ON THEM INCLUDING A WOOL HARBOR THEN PLAYED A WOOD MONOPOLY AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME TO TURN MY ROAD INTO A WOOL AND WHEAT EMPIRE EVERY TURN HAD ME RAKING IN LARGE AMOUNTS OF EITHER RESOURCE AND I COULD TRADE FOR ANYTHING I WANTED WON WITH A LIBRARY CARD IT WAS A LOT MORE FUN WITH CATAN THAN I'VE HAD IN AGES

GAME OF THRONES CG 1ST EDITION PICKED THIS UP AT THE FANTASY FLIGHT GAME CENTER HOLIDAY SALE OVER THE WEEKEND SPENT AND GOT THE CORE SET AND FIVE CHAPTER PACKS EACH EPIC BATTLES ANCIENT ENEMIES REFUGEES OF WAR SACRED BONDS AND MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR THE GREYJOY MARTELL EXPANSIONS TO GO ON SALE BE IN STOCK THEN WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD FUN DECKS NOT LOOKING TO KEEP UP WITH THE META OF THE SECOND EDITION OR PAY LOTS OF MONEY WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER GAMES

WIFE AND I PLAYED IT LAST NIGHT SHE WAS HOUSE STARK AND I WAS HOUSE TARGARYEN SHE SMOKED ME IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE EVERY PHASE SHE JUST RAKED IN POWER IT'S A GOOD THING NOW SHE'LL PLAY AGAIN

EDIT FORGOT A GAME
I PLAYTESTED A GAME I DESIGNED WITH SEVERAL GROUPS OF FRIENDS I'M THANKFUL THAT THIS HOBBY HAS EXPLODED PROVIDING ME WITH TONS OF INSPIRATION I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY GAME UNSTUFFED THE PLAN IS FOR A ROUND TO TAKE LESS THAN MINUTES
CARCASSONNE JUST GOT THIS GAME RECENTLY AND IT'S PRETTY FUN SIMPLE AND QUICK I INTRODUCED FIELDS TO MY FRIEND AND HE DESTROYED ME THEN A SECOND FRIEND ARRIVED BUT WASN'T REALLY PAYING ATTENTION WHEN I TRIED TO EXPLAIN FIELDS SOMEHOW THOUGH HE HANDILY BEAT ME AND MY OTHER FIELD FRIEND IT WAS KIND OF FUNNY BOTH OF US WERE CONFIDENT WE WOULD WIN BUT SOMEHOW JUST DIDN'T GET ENOUGH POINTS FROM OUR FIELDS TO OVERCOME HIS MASSIVE LEAD I THINK WE WERE FIGHTING OVER FIELDS TOO MUCH AND LOST OTHER SOURCES OF POINTS

RED WE PLAYED THIS GAME WHILE WAITING FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO SHOW UP I LIKE THIS GAME A LOT EVEN THOUGH MY FRIENDS COMPLAIN THAT IT'S TOO

WONDERS THIS GAME IS REALLY FUN BUT I'M USUALLY TEACHING IT SO MY FUN IS DILUTED BY CONSTANTLY ANSWERING STUPID QUESTIONS I'M ALSO BAD AT IT MY FRIEND WHO HADN'T PLAYED BEFORE WON BY QUITE A LOT BY GETTING SMALLISH AMOUNTS OF POINTS FROM A TON OF DIFFERENT SOURCES

CARCASSONNE PLAYED THIS AGAIN BUT THIS TIME AT SCHOOL WITHOUT FIELDS SEVERAL PEOPLE HAD TO SWAP OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE GAME SO IT WAS A BIT CHAOTIC

PANDEMIC WE PLAYED THIS WITH SIX EPIDEMIC CARDS BUT WE CHOSE OUR ROLES WE WERE REALLY CLOSE AND IT LOOKED LIKE AN EASY WIN BUT IT ESCALATED REALLY QUICKLY AT THE END AND WE LOST BECAUSE OF A CHAIN OF OUTBREAKS NEAR SHANGHAI

MACHS VS MINIONS WE PLAYED THROUGH MISSIONS 2 AND IT WAS A LITTLE BIT ANTICLIMACTIC AND MISSION WAS PRETTY EASY BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD FUN I'M PARANOID THAT I FORGOT A BUNCH OF RULES THOUGH

HANAFI POINTS I THINK THIS IS EITHER MY RECORD OR MY SECOND BEST SCORE WE AREN'T GOOD AT HANAFI

COUP BUNCH OF TIMES I HATE THIS GAME BECAUSE I'VE PLAYED IT SO DAMN MUCH IT WAS ONE OF MY FIRST HOBBY GAMES AND I TOOK IT ON SEVERAL SCHOOL TRIPS SO I'VE PLAYED IT MORE THAN ENOUGH TIMES I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT HAS ANYTHING NEW TO OFFER ME MY FRIENDS LIKE IT THOUGH SO I'M OFTEN STUCK PLAYING IT
MY PARTNER AND I TOOK HANAFI AND HIVE OUT ON A DATE NIGHT AND GOT ONE PLAY OF EACH GOTTA LOVE HAVING PORTABLE GAMES

I ALSO GOT THE SPLENDOR APP FROM THE HUMBLE MOBILE BUNDLE AND HAVE BEEN PLAYING THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY LOUSY AGAINST THE AI BUT I'M STILL HAVING A GOOD TIME

BUT MOST EXCITINGLY MY GROUP FINISHED PANDEMIC LEGACY WE FINISHED NOVEMBER SOMETIME LAST MONTH AND HAVE BEEN ON THE EDGE OF OUR SEATS WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BLITZ THROUGH DECEMBER IT WAS A WILD EXPERIENCE AND NOW THAT WE'RE DONE I'VE GOTTA SAY THAT PLAYING THIS GAME WAS EASILY THE MOST FUN I'VE HAD WITH BOARD GAMES



IN RESPONSE TO QUESTION I'M REALLY THANKFUL FOR A PARTNER WHO IS AS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT BOARD GAMES AS I AM WHEN WE'RE GOING OUT FOR A DATE SHE'LL OFTEN BE THE FIRST TO ASK SHOULD WE BRING A GAME SHE SITS DOWN AND ENDURES MY CLUMSY RULES EXPLANATIONS SO WE CAN TRY NEW GAMES IT'S JUST SO DANG I SUPPOSE ON THE FLIP SIDE I'M THANKFUL TO BOARD GAMES FOR GIVING ME SUCH AN ENJOYABLE DYNAMIC THING TO SHARE WITH MY PARTNER
CATAN X ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS MY GAME OVERALL THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME I'D PLAYED CATAN IN MONTHS MY FRIEND RODE AN EARLY CITY PLUS LONGEST ROAD TO VICTORY WHILE I CAME IN 2ND WITH POINTS NICE TO KNOCK OUT A GAME IN ABOUT MINUTES

COUP X MY MOST PLAYED GAME THIS YEAR SNUCK IN A WIN IN THE FIRST GAME WHICH PROMPTED OTHERS TO ASSASSINATE ME QUICKLY IN THE NEXT TWO WHILE I STILL ENJOY THIS ONE IT'S DEFINITELY DROPPED A BIT AGAINST OTHER SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES NAMELY SPYFAULT

CARCASSONNE 2 X PLAYED TWO GAMES BACK-TO-BACK AFTER WINNING THE FIRST ONE I WAS LEADING IN A CLOSE SECOND GAME UNTIL I CASUALLY PLACED A SINGLE TILE THAT GAVE POINTS WORTH OF FARMING TO MY F DESPITE MY FRUSTRATION I'M REALLY IMPRESSED AT HOW THIS GAME STILL REVEALS NEW STRATEGIES AFTER PLAYS

DRAGONHOOD X OBVIOUSLY I'M BIASED BUT I THINK THIS GAME WORKS GREAT AS A FILLER UNDERRATED IN MY OPINION

DOMINION X AFTER ONLY OWING THE BASE GAME FOR A YEAR I RECENTLY PICKED UP INTRIGUE AND PROSPERITY WE ALMOST ALWAYS USE SOME SORT OF ACTION FORKER I EAST VILLAGE BUT DIDN'T THIS TIME WHICH WAS A NICE CHANGE OF PACE I LOVE THE PLATINUM AND COLONIES THAT PROSPERITY ADDS BUT MAN DO THEY EXTEND THE GAME LENGTH THIS ONE TOOK US WELL OVER AN HOUR

SCYTHE X THE HYPE IS DESERVED I'M HONESTLY NOT SURE A GAME HAS EVER STUCK IN MY HEAD AFTERWARD AS MUCH AS THIS ONE DID SO IMMERSIVE HIGHLY THEMATIC AND STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL I COULD JUST STARE AT THE BOARD AND CARDS FOR HOURS I GOT ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED FINISHING LAST OUT OF FOUR PLAYERS WITH POINTS TO THE WINNER'S BUT REALLY ENJOYED THE GAME FLOW AND THE VARIETY PACKED INTO THE BOX I'M ALREADY STOKED TO GIVE THIS ONE ANOTHER SHOT

THIS WEEK IT'S THANKSGIVING IN THE U SOUTH WHAT ARE YOU THANKFUL TO BOARD GAMES ABOUT

THIS COULD EASILY BE AN ANSWER BUT I'LL START WITH MY IMMENSE THANKFULNESS A FULL-TIME JOB IN THE BOARD GAME INDUSTRY THIS YEAR AFTER SOME REALLY TOUGH EXPERIENCES IN SCHOOL AND IN JOBS THAT WEREN'T A GOOD FIT I'M BEYOND LUCKY TO HAVE LANDED WITH A COMPANY SO DEDICATED TO TAKING CARE OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES ALIKE I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND LIKE A GATEWRIGHT SHILL BUT IT REALLY IS A GENUINE PLEASURE TO SPEND EACH DAY WORKING HERE

ON TOP OF THAT I'VE MET AND PLAYED GAMES WITH DOZENS OF NEW PEOPLE THIS YEAR GAMING HAS GOTTEN ME TO SOCIALIZE MORE IN GENERAL ATTENDING METUMPS WITHOUT KNOWING ANYONE BEFOREHAND AS WELL AS SPENDING MORE QUALITY TIME WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING YEAR OF DISCOVERY AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW IT CONTINUES
PATCHWORK I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TRY THIS ONE FOR A WHILE AS I DO MOST OF MY GAMING WITH MY FIANCEE WE PLAYED IT AT OUR FAGS AND HAD A GOOD TIME WITH IT IT WAS FRUSTRATING TO HAVE NEGATIVE SCORES FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF GAMES BUT I THINK WE'RE FINALLY CATCHING ON TO THE RIGHT BALANCE OF SPEED BUTTONS AND SPACE ON THE BOARD DOESN'T REPLACE JAIPUR AS OUR GAME BUT IT'S A GOOD EFFORT BY UWE

BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL PLAYED WITH SOME FRIENDS AT OUR FAGS AND HAD A PRETTY GOOD TIME IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND HIGHLY THEMATIC BUT I GENERALLY PREFER MECHANICS OVER THEME AND THAT'S WHERE THE GAME FALLS SHORT BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR CHARACTERS HAD MOVED AROUND THE HOUSE WE WERE CAUGHT UNPREPARED BY THE HAUNT AND THE OUROBOROS SLAUGHTERED US IN TURNS STILL HAD FUN BUT I WOULD PROBABLY ONLY PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN AS PART OF A GAME NIGHT

NEVERMORE A FILLER WEIGHT DRAFTING GAME WHERE PLAYERS TRY TO COLLECT THE MOST OF ANY ONE OF DIFFERENT SUITS OF CARDS EACH OF WHICH GRANTS AN ABILITY SUCH AS ATTACKING HEALING OR GAINING ACCESS TO SPECIAL MAGIC CARDS A FUN LITTLE DIVERSION AND ANOTHER GOOD HORROR NIGHT GAME TO CONSIDER

JUPITER RESCUE A WONDERFUL LITTLE COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE THE PLAYERS ARE ROBOTS TRYING TO EVACUATE HUMANS FROM A SPACE STATION THAT IS RAPIDLY FILLING WITH ZOMBIELIKE CREEPS I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ONE AND THOUGH MANY OF THE MECHANISMS APE PANDEMIC I DID FEEL LIKE THIS GAME HAD A LITTLE MORE SOUL THOUGH PROBABLY LESS REPLACEABILITY THE MINIS LOOK GREAT ON THE TABLE AND THE THEME IS WONDERFULLY INTEGRATED HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR COOP FANS

BROOM SERVICE AN EXPANSION AND REIMPLEMENTATION OF BREW I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ONE IT COMBINES ROLE SELECTION AND MECHANISMS BEAUTIFULLY AND ADDS SOME MEAT TO AN OLDER GAME THAT IN MY OPINION REALLY NEEDED IT I'D LOVE TO PICK THIS ONE UP SOON



I'M THANKFUL TO BOARD GAMES FOR ADDING A NEW COMPETITIVE DIMENSION TO MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FIANCEE SHE DOESN'T PLAY VIDEO GAMES SO OUR BOARD GAME TIME IS REALLY SPECIAL

2 STUFFING I TEND TO LIKE HEAVIER GAMES BUT I DON'T APPRECIATE WHEN FILLER GAMES MASQUERADE AS SOMETHING MORE THE BIGGEST OFFENDER THAT I CAN THINK OF IS LOST CITIES THE BOARD GAME AND EVEN MANY EXPANSIONS FOR CATAN THEY ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO PLAY TIME BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO THE DEPTH OR OVERALL EXPERIENCE
I PLAYED A BUNCH OF GAMES THIS WEEK AT TOO MANY TO LIST OUT AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF MY FAVORITES WERE RAILROAD REVOLUTION PARIS CONNECTION AND INSIDER

ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CONVENTION WAS MEETING AND PLAYING GAMES WITH U WATCHITPLAYED MY HUSBAND AND I INTRODUCED HIM TO PARIS CONNECTION AND HE LIKED IT I THINK IT'S A GREAT GAME BECAUSE THE RULES ARE SO SIMPLE BUT THEN THERE'S A LOT OF STRATEGY IN MESSING UP OTHER PEOPLE'S TRAIN ROUTES AND DECIDING WHETHER IT'S MORE WORTH IT TO TAKE MORE SHARES OR TO BUILD OUT ROUTES

QUESTIONS

I'M THANKFUL FOR ALL THE FRIENDS I'VE MADE THROUGH BOARD GAMES IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A COMMON HOBBY AND BE ABLE TO PLAY BOARD GAMES WHEN YOU'RE WITH FRIENDS

2 I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF GAMES ARE BECOMING LIKE THIS RECENTLY OR MAYBE I'M GETTING MORE USED TO SIMPLER MECHANICS WITH TRAIN GAMES BUT I THOUGHT BOTH A FEAST FOR ODIN AND LISBOA WERE A LITTLE BLOATED I STILL ENJOYED PLAYING THEM BUT THEY WEREN'T SUPER AWESOMELY GREAT
FOUND THIS AFTER GETTING INTO BOARD GAMING AGAIN RECENTLY MORE BY LUCK THAN JUDGEMENT I BOUGHT MYSELF THE DC HEROES CCC AS I LOVE ALL THINGS DC SO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A FUN THING TO OWN AND THE CRISIS EXPANSION ADDS A CO-OP AND SOLO MODE SO I COULD PLAY IT ON MY OWN I HADN'T FOUND A SUITABLE HOME FOR IT IN MY APARTMENT WHEN MY MUM CAME FOR ONE OF HER REGULAR VISITS AND SHE SPOTTED IT AND AFTER TELLING HER ABOUT IT ASKED IF I FANCIED A GAME OF IT WHICH I WASN'T EXPECTING WE REALLY ENJOYED IT SO THE PAST FEW WEEKS I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR OTHER FUN TABLETOP GAMES WHICH ARE GOOD FOR 2 PLAYER CO-OP BONUS IF THEY'RE ALSO GOOD SOLO I MAY HAVE BECOME A LITTLE ADDICTED OOPS

MY GAMING THIS PAST WEEK

D D ADVENTURE BOARD GAME THE TEMPLE OF ELEMENTAL EVIL MUM VISITED AGAIN ON SATURDAY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF VISITS WE HAD BEEN PLAYING THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN STORY OF THIS AND THIS WEEK WE SAT DOWN TO COMPLETE THE FINAL FEW ADVENTURES TO WHICH WE SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED WE BOTH REALLY ENJOYED THE GAME AND I LIKED THAT THE GAMEPLAY WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH THAT AFTER SOME QUARTERBACKING TO START WITH SHE WAS ABLE TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO PLAY AND PLAY OUT HER OWN TURNS THE GAME PIECES ARE GENERALLY GOOD QUALITY THE TILES CARDS AND MOST OF THE MINIS ARE GOOD THE BLACK DRAGON WAS REALLY GREAT AND LOOKED HUGE WHEN TOWERING OVER OUR HEROES WHICH WE LOVED ALTHOUGH A FEW OF THE BASIC MONSTER MINIS WERE A BIT POOR QUALITY IMO AND THE STORY FLOWED WELL FROM ONE ADVENTURE TO THE NEXT I WOULD HAVE LIKED A BIT MORE DEPTH TO THE WAY IN WHICH YOUR CHARACTERS COULD GROW AS YOU PROGRESS THE SINGLE LEVEL UP AND THEN BUYING BOOST TYPE TOKENS THAT CAN BE USED ONCE PER ADVENTURE TO GRANT YOU A REROLL OR TO RECHARGE A USED ABILITY OR REGAIN FELT A LITTLE BASIC BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK ANYTHING MORE COMPLEX WOULD REALLY FIT WITH WHAT THEY'RE AIMING FOR WITH THESE GAMES VERY FUN AND A GOOD GATEWAY INTO BOARD GAMING AND DUNGEON CRAWLERS BUT MIGHT BE A BIT BASIC SIMPLE FOR THOSE MORE EXPERIENCED I THINK

STAR TREK FRONTIERS I STARTED LOOKING FOR MORE COMPLEX GAMES IN PARTICULAR ONES WHICH ARE GOOD SOLO FOR TIMES I FANCY SOME BOARDGAMING OUTSIDE OF THE VISIT FROM THE MOTHERSHIP IN MY SEARCHES FOR RECOMMENDED SOLO GAMES ONE NAME KEPT COMING UP MAGE KNIGHT I LOVE FANTASY DRAGONS ETC SO THE THEME LOOKED INTERESTING AND I WAS ALL SET TO BUY IT AND THEN I SAW THEY HAD JUST RELEASED A STAR TREK THEMED VERSION BASED IN THE NEXT GEN ERA THE PEAK OF MY TREK TV WATCHING I NEVER WATCHED TOS SO WENT FOR THAT INSTEAD IT TURNED UP ON FRIDAY SO I READ THROUGH THE GUIDE AND RULEBOOKS THEN PLAYED THROUGH THE INTRODUCTORY SCENARIO I REALLY LIKE HOW THE GAME PLAYS THERE'S PLENTY TO DO AND YOU FIND YOURSELF LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT WAYS TO LEVEL UP EITHER BY EXPLORING FIGHTING ROMULIAN SHIPS OR ROMULIAN DOMINION STAIRCASES GOING ON AWAY MISSIONS TO PLANETS ETC WHILE THE DUMMY PLAYER KEEPS THE PACING OF THE GAME FLOWING WELL THE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME SO FAR WAS THE PLAYER SHIP MINIS ARE A LITTLE SMALL AND LACKING IN DETAIL WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF THEY HAD SOME COLOUR THE CHOICE OF SISKO AND THE DEFIANT AS THE SECOND FEDERATION SHIP IS A LITTLE ODD TO ME TOO I'D HAVE PROBABLY GONE WITH JANEWAY VOYAGER I KNOW OF IS IN THE GAME AS A CREW MEMBER YOU CAN ACQUIRE ALTHOUGH SHE DIDN'T COME UP IN MY GAME BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OTHER CHARACTERS FROM VOYAGER ARE AVAILABLE I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING OUT SOME MORE OF THE SCENARIOS AND TAKING THOSE MENACING LOOKING BORG CUBES IN THE BOX

LORD OF THE RINGS CG ANOTHER GAME I SAW REPEATEDLY MENTIONED AS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR SOLO PLAY AS WELL AS 2 PLAYER CO-OP SO PICKED UP THE CORE GAME BOX EARLY IN THE WEEK IN MY EXCITEMENT TOO HAVE PLAYED THROUGH THE OPENING SCENARIO A COUPLE OF TIMES OVER THE PAST WEEK USING THE PREGUILT DECKS AND AGAIN USING ONE I PUT TOGETHER MYSELF WHICH FARED MUCH BETTER INTRIGUED TO SEE HOW IT FARES ON THE SECOND AND THIRD SCENARIOS IN THE BOX AS WELL AS FINDING OUT HOW THE GAME PROGRESSES AS YOU GO THROUGH IT AND START GETTING THE ADDITIONAL CONTENT FROM EXPANSIONS IS IT JUST THE NEXT BIT OF THE STORY WITH CARDS FOR THE ASSOCIATED SCENARIOS LOCATIONS AND ENEMIES OR DOES IT ALSO GIVE SOME CHARACTER PROGRESSION IN SOME WAY I'D IMAGINE MOST LIKELY THROUGH MORE CARDS YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PLACE INTO YOUR DECK MAYBE EVEN NEW HEROES TOO


SO THAT WAS MY WEEK MY AMAZON WHICH WILL LIKELY BECOME MY XMAS IS ALREADY PACKED WITH SEVERAL OTHER GAMES I'VE SEEN WHICH I'D LIKE TO ADD TO THE COLLECTION AND I'M KEEPING MY EYE OUT FOR THE OF ROBINSON CRUSOE WHEN THAT COMES OUT AND THAT'S ANOTHER ONE I'VE SEEN RECOMMENDED HIGHLY AS A GREAT SOLO CO-OP GAME

IF ANYONE HAS ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR EITHER SOLO GAMES WITH GOOD DEPTH COMPLEXITY OR CO-OP GAMES WHICH WORK WELL WITH 2 PLAYERS AND ARE EASY TO LEARN HARD TO MASTER I EAST MY MUM COULD PLAY WITHOUT ME TELLING HER WHAT TO DO BUT ALSO HAS ENOUGH DEPTH CHOICES THAT I WON'T BE BORED THEN PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW
PLAYED MY FIRST GAME OF CONCORDIA CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY AGAIN

PANDEMIC TEAM WIN NEITHER OF US HAD PLAYED IN AWHILE AND IT WAS OUR FIRST TIME PLAYING TOGETHER I HAD NEVER WON BEFORE I DON'T THINK HE HAD EITHER SO WE PLAYED WITH EPIDEMIC CARDS WE DID SO WELL THAT AFTER WE FOUND ALL THE CURES WE DECIDED TO TRY TO ERADICATE ALL THE DISEASES AND MADE IT WITH 2 TURNS TO GO MEDIC DISPATCHER IS AMAZING

SEASONS I WON BOTH FINALLY GOT ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO PLAY SEASONS WITH ME AND IT WENT OVER WELL COOL THING WAS HOW DIFFERENT THE GAMES WERE BASED ON THE CARDS THAT SHOWED UP RD IN THE SECOND GAME WAS POINTS AHEAD OF ST IN THE FIRST GAME I KINDA WISH I HAD SANDBAGGED A BIT BUT ITS SO HARD TO TELL WHO'S GOING TO WIN THAT I COULDN'T DO IT EASILY ALSO I NEVER WIN GAMES IN THIS GROUP SO I WANTED TO WIN

TRICERION WE PICKED UP THE GIFTS EXPANSION AND WANTED TO GIVE THE TWO PLAYER VARIANT A TRY WE ONLY PLAYED THE BASE GAME WITHOUT THE DARK ALLEY BUT REALLY ENJOYED HOW THE DUEL OF MAGICIANS PERFORMANCE CARDS ADD VARIETY TO LINKING TRICKS AND WE ESPECIALLY LIKED HOW THE TURN SETUP CARDS CREATE VARIETY FOR TWO PLAYERS ELIMINATING SOME OF THE PUNISHMENT FOR TURN ORDER THE EXPANSION MAKES ONE OF OUR FAVORITE GAMES EVEN BETTER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ADDING THE MAGICIANS POWERS
SAN JUAN PURCHASED LAST WEEK DURING THE ALEA AMAZON SALE IT S A GAME WE VE WANTED TO TRY FOR A LONG TIME AND REALLY ENJOYED IT WE VE OWNED PUERTO RICO FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT RARELY PLAY IT I THINK THIS WILL HIT THE TABLE AND SCRATCH THE SAME ITCH MORE EASILY

GOBBLE GOBBLE I M THANKFUL FOR THE QUIET TIME OF BOARD GAMES I ENJOY SOLVING THE PUZZLE OF HOW TO SCORE THE MOST POINTS TOGETHER WITH MY WIFE

2 STUFFED DUNGEON PETZ I WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME WORKER PLACEMENT AND CARING FOR PETS BUT IT S JUST TOO BUSY WITH TOO MANY WONKY RULES AND THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO LOVES TRICERION

I ONLY GOT ONE GAME OF SCYTHE IN THIS WEEK BECAUSE OF TRAVELING BUT IT WAS A DOOZY MY OPPONENT PLAYED SUPER AGGRESSIVE CORNERING ME IN THE FACTORY WITH HIS THREE MACHS I FIGURED I HAD TO STRIKE FIRST IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT NOT A BLOODBATH I ATTACKED ONE OF HIS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY STOLEN AN OIL RESOURCE FROM ME THAT PUT ME ON EDGE EARLY IN THE GAME I ONLY HAD ONE COMBAT CARD BUT LUCKILY IT WAS A I WON THE COMBAT AND ON THE NEXT TURN HE ATTACKED ME WITH TWO MACHS AND I DIDN'T PUT UP A FIGHT TO RESERVE POWER BJORN AND MAX WERE SENT BACK HOME BUT I WAS ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY TURN IT AROUND AND ATTACK BECAUSE OF MY FACTORY TECHNOLOGY AND SOME LUCKY PLACEMENT OF MY TUNNEL STRUCTURE AND HIS CHARACTER GUNTER CONVENIENTLY POSITIONED ON A TUNNEL HE WAS WEAK BECAUSE OF THE TWO BATTLES USING ALMOST ALL OF HIS POWER AND COMBAT CARDS WHILE I COULD STILL ATTACK WITH FULL POWER ALBEIT I HAD NO CARDS TO GUARANTEE A VICTORY IT WAS THE MOST TENSE COMBAT GAME I'VE PLAYED SO FAR I WON PRETTY HANDEDLY BECAUSE I MAXED OUT MY POWER EARLY WON TWO COMBATS COMPLETED AN OBJECTIVE THAT NECESSITATED HAVING THE MOST POWER AND CONTROLLING THE FACTORY BUILT MY STRUCTURES AND FINISHED EARLY BY COMPLETING MY LAST UPGRADE COMPLETELY SURPRISING MY OPPONENT I DID ALL OF THIS AND WON WITHOUT DEPLOYING A SINGLE MECH AND ONLY GETTING ONE ENLIST IT WAS CRAZY AND ALTHOUGH MY OPPONENTS STRATEGY DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL IT WAS A LOT OF FUN TO PLAY THE GAME IN REALLY DIFFERENT WAY

I'M THANKFUL TO BOARDGAMES FOR GIVING ME A HOBBY TO SHARE WITH OTHER PEOPLE I HONESTLY NEVER FELT AS CONNECTED WHILE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND I SPEND TOO MUCH TIME LOOKING AT SCREENS FOR WORK AND WHATNOT SO IT'S GREAT TO HAVE SOMETHING TACTILE TO USE AS ENTERTAINMENT

2 EH I HAVEN'T FOUND THIS PROBLEM YET SO I GUESS I'M THANKFUL FOR THAT
I FINALLY GOT MY GAME GROUP BACK TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2 MONTHS WE ALMOST ALL WORK IN POLITICS

RED PLAYED WHILE WAITING FOR OTHER FOLKS TO SHOW UP

TERRAFORMING MARS FIRST TIME PLAYING THIS I STRUGGLED A LITTLE BIT WITH TEACHING THE RULES AS I HAD READ THE MANUAL WEEKS AGO BUT NEVER PLAYED ONCE WE GOT IT DOWN THE GAME FLOWED REALLY WELL NOT SURE I WANT TO PLAY IT AT AGAIN AS IT CAN GET A LITTLE SLOW BUT THE GAME WAS REALLY FUN LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING IT AGAIN WITH THE ADVANCED CORPORATIONS AND POSSIBLY THE DRAFTING VARIANT

GOOD COP BAD COP SOME PEOPLE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING LIGHT AFTER PLAYING TERRAFORMING MARS THE FIRST GAME WAS REALLY QUICK I WAS THE KINGPIN AND GOT KILLED THE SECOND GAME WAS VERY STRANGE WITH THINGS HAPPENING SEEMINGLY AT RANDOM I WAS THE AGENT AND SHOT A GUY WHO HAD BEEN CROOKED BUT HAD EVIDENCE PLANTED ON HIM SO HE WAS HONEST OOPS WE ENDED UP WINNING WHEN THE HONEST COPS DREW EXACTLY THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT REVERSE TURN ORDER AND COFFEE FOR AN EXTRA TURN TO SHOOT THE KINGPIN TWICE

MYSTERIUM IT WAS THE PORTAL VERSION WHICH I HAVEN'T PLAYED FOR OVER A YEAR WE BURNED OUT AFTER PLAYING IT A TON WHEN I FIRST GOT IT WE CONTINUE TO BE TERRIBLE AT THIS GAME AND LOST YET AGAIN I THINK WE ONLY HAVE ONE VICTORY SO FAR OVER ABOUT PLAYS WE JUST AREN'T ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH

CONCORDIA FIRST TIME IN A WHILE HAD TWO NEW PLAYERS SO WE DIDN'T PLAY WITH THE SALSA EXPANSION WHICH I STILL HAVEN'T PLAYED WITH THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES BUT WHEN YOU START THE STRATEGY TO MAXIMIZE YOUR SCORE ISN'T VERY INTUITIVE EVEN THOUGH THE GAMEPLAY IS NOW I THINK I'M GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN PLAY THE GAME INTUITIVELY TO MAXIMIZE MY POINTS I ENDED UP WINNING BY A LARGE MARGIN WITH A GOOD SET OF MARS AND MERCURY CARDS HAVING MAXED OUT BOTH


QUESTIONS

GAMING HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF MY LIFE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE MADE NEW FRIENDS GROWN CLOSER WITH OTHERS AND SCRATCHED MY COLLECTING ITCH THAT I'VE ALWAYS HAD I LOVE THE MENTAL EXERCISE THEY GIVE ME AND PLAYING GAMES HAS MADE ME MORE CREATIVE THAN I USED TO BE

2 I LIKE HEAVY GAMES SO IT ISN'T OFTEN I THINK A GAME HAS TOO MUCH I THINK I DISLIKE GAMES THAT HEW TOO CLOSELY TO SIMULATIONS AS THEY SEEM TO SACRIFICE ELEGANCE FOR COMPREHENSIVENESS
I JUST RECENTLY STARTED GETTING INTO BOARD GAMING WITH MY FIANCEE WE LOVE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES BUT SHE SAID SHE MISSED THE TOUCH OF BOARD GAMES WE STARTED WITH JUST SETTLES OF CATAN AND CASTLES OF BURGUNDY 2 YEARS AGO BUT HAVE SLOWLY BEEN GROWING A COLLECTION OF GAMES THIS WEEK WE BOTH HAD A LOT OF DOWNTIME OVER THE WEEKEND AND DECIDED TO START PLAYING SEVERAL GAMES THAT WE HAD NOT HAD A CHANCE TO TOUCH BEFORE

CASTLES OF THE MAD KING LUDWIG SURPRISINGLY STRAIGHT FORWARD MUCH LESS COMPLEX AND INTIMIDATING THAN THE BOX MAKES IT APPEAR TOOK US ABOUT MINUTES TO PLAY ENDED IN A TIE TECHNICALLY I WON BY SQ FEET CREATING OUR CASTLES WAS REALLY FUN AND WE BOTH QUICKLY LEARNED TO SYNERGIZE OUR ROOMS TO MAXIMIZE ON POINTS WE BOTH THOUGHT IT WAS A FUN GAME AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER PLAY

ESCAPE THE CURSE OF THE TEMPLE I GOT THIS GAME AS A FUN COOPERATIVE GAME THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ENJOY TOGETHER MY FIANCEE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT WE TRIED THE FIRST GAME WITHOUT THE BUILT-IN EXPANSIONS AND PLAYED AGAIN WITH THE EXPANSIONS I CAN ALREADY TELL WE ARE BOTH GOING TO BE PLAYING THIS MANY TIMES AND I'M ALREADY EAGER TO GET SOME EXPANSIONS FOR IT IN THE FUTURE THE GAME PIECES ARE WELL MADE AND MY FIANCEE LOVED THE GREEN GEM TOKENS THAT THE GAME CONTAINS

SEASONS THIS GAME TOOK A LITTLE WHILE FOR US TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO ACTUALLY PLAY BUT ONCE WE UNDERSTOOD THE RULES IT GOES BY VERY QUICKLY AND IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THE GAME ITSELF TOOK NO MORE THAN MINUTES TO PLAY BUT THERE WAS PROBABLY AN ADDITIONAL MINUTES OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO PLAY AND ANOTHER TO BUILD OUR FIRST DECKS SINCE WE WERE PLAYING FOR THE FIRST TIME THE GAME IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING WITH COLORFUL ENGRAVED WOODEN DICE VERY VIBRANT AND UNIQUE CARDS AND PLAYER BOARDS THE RULE BOOK FOR THE GAME IS ALSO FANTASTIC WITH EXPLANATIONS INSIDE FOR THE UNIQUE INTERACTIONS THAT EACH CARD COULD HAVE TO CLARIFY ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE DURING THE GAME

PATCHWORK VERY FUN GAME WE ONLY PLAYED ONCE BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EASILY PLAY WHEN WE ONLY HAVE MINUTES TO PLAY SOMETHING AND WANT TO JUST RELAX THE COMPONENTS FOR THE GAME ARE ALL CARDBOARD BUT THEY WORK PERFECTLY FOR THE GAME

CARNIVORE KOALA DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A VERY POPULAR GAME BASED ON OWNERSHIP BUT IT IS VERY THEMATIC FUN COLORFUL AND SIMPLE THE HARDEST PART OF THIS GAME WAS THE ORIGINAL MINUTE INVESTMENT IN LEARNING THE RULES AND WHAT EACH SYMBOL MEANT IT IS A VERY LIGHT GAME AND CAN PROBABLY BE PLAYED IN MINUTES TOPS

THE INSTITUTE FOR MAGICAL ARTS WE ARE BOTH HARRY POTTER FANS AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE GOT THIS GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE THE GAME DOES NOT HAVE A TON OF DEPTH BUT WE STILL ENJOYED THE GAME BECAUSE OF THE THEME ITSELF THE COMPONENTS FEEL SOMEWHAT LACKING AS THEY CONSIST OF WOODEN CHIPS AND CUBES WHERE THEY COULD HAVE OPTED FOR SOME MORE THEMATIC TOKEN AND THE ARTWORK ON THE CARDS ARE VERY LACKLUSTER A GAME TAKES AROUND MINUTES WE WILL PLAY THIS AGAIN IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF ITS PORTABILITY AND THEME BUT IT DOES NOT RANK VERY HIGH FOR ME PERSONALLY

STAR FLUX THE GAME IS VERY FUN TO PLAY BUT WOULD DEFINITELY BE MORE FUN WITH ADDITIONAL PLAYERS THE STAR THEME IS GREAT AND THE CARD INTERACTIONS ARE VERY WELL MADE GAMES ARE SHORT AND THERE WAS AN URGE TO PLAY AGAIN AFTER FINISHING EACH ONE WE ARE BOTH LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THIS AGAIN ESPECIALLY IF WE HAVE COMPANY OVER

FLASH POINT FIRE RESCUE WE BOTH LIKE COOPERATIVE GAMES AND DECIDED TO GIVE THIS GAME A WHIRL I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST ABOUT THE REPLACEABILITY DURING THE SETUP BUT AS SOON AS WE GOT INTO THE GAME IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT NO 2 GAMES WOULD BE THE SAME WE HAD A BLAST RACING TO SAVE THE SURVIVORS FROM THE BURNING HOME THERE WAS A CONSTANT DREAD ON OUR MIND THROUGHOUT THE GAME OF WHEN THE HOUSE WOULD COLLAPSE FROM STRUCTURAL DECAY OR THERE BEING A SHOCKWAVE OR EXPLOSION KILLING THE LAST VICTIM WE NEEDED TO SAVE WE ONLY PLAYED THE BASIC FAMILY SETUP BUT WE ARE BOTH READY TO DIVE IN AGAIN WITH THE MORE EXPERIENCED SETUP FOR MORE CHALLENGES

TRURO OF THE SEAS SIMPLE ENOUGH GAME ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THE DRAGON RULES OF HOW TO ADJUST THEIR POSITIONING OR ROTATION THE GAME WENT BY TOO QUICKLY WITH ONLY 2 PLAYERS BUT IS BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED AND HAS DEPTH OF PLAY AND A TON OF REPLAY VALUE WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING THIS AGAIN BUT ONLY WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE TO PLAY WITH MORE THAN 2 PLAYERS

I'M NOT SURE HOW FAR ANYONE MADE IT THROUGH READING THIS WALL OF TEXT BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY NICE TO THINK OVER THE GAMES WE PLAYED THIS WEEKEND IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS BASED ON ANYTHING THAT WE'VE ALREADY PLAYED PLEASE LET US KNOW
X PLAYS OF GREAT WESTERN TRAIL WOW JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS GAME PLAYED 2 X AND X CURRENTLY RATED AS MY SECOND OF BG GAME FOR ME A BRILLIANT MIX OF MECHANICS WITH SIMPLE ELEGANT GAMEPLAY AND TOUCH DECISION ON EVERY TURN

2 X FABLED FRUIT THIS GAME CONTINUES TO GET PLAYS AS WE WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THE DECK OF CARDS FUN LIGHT WORKER PLACEMENT GAME THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN PLAY

PALACES OF CARRARA PLAYED WITH MY WIFE SUCH A GREAT GAME AND I REALLY LIKE HOW CHESS LIKE THE BRICK BUYING IS IN THE GAME PREVIOUSLY HAD ONLY PLAYED AND

SABOTEUR I DIDN'T REALLY ENJOY THIS GAME I WAS THE PROFITEER

DECEPTION PLAYED GAMES OF THIS BOTH TIMES I WAS THE INVESTIGATOR I GOT THE WINNING GUESS IN THE SECOND GAME THOUGH A LOT OF THE OTHER INVESTIGATORS THOUGHT I WAS THE MURDERER

ABOVE AND BELOW PLAYED A GAME OF THIS CAME IN LAST BUT I HAD A BLAST GOING ON ALL THE QUESTS THE GAME ISN'T BALANCED ANYONE THAT IS SET ON WINNING CAN DO SO BY GATHERING RESOURCES RATHER THAN GOING ON QUESTS BUT THAT TAKES THE FUN OUT OF IT THANKFULLY THE GROUP I PLAYED WITH ALL EQUALLY WENT ON QUESTS

I'M IN CANADA WE WERE THANKFUL LAST MONTH BUT I LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS WHILE NOT BEING WASTED IN A BAR

PANDEMIC WE FUCKING LOST
KITTENS IN A BLENDER

WONDERS DUEL ONE OF MY VISITING FRIEND'S ACQUISITIONS PRETTY GOOD DISTILLED VERSION OF WONDERS WHICH IS A BIT FASTER IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY I DO FEEL LIKE YOU SPEND MORE TIME BUILDING THE CARD STRUCTURES FOR EACH ROUND THAN ACTUALLY TAKING CARDS THOUGH WHICH IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING
LANTERNS THE HARVEST FESTIVAL MY NEW GAME I READ A FEW REVIEWS ABOUT IT LAST YEAR AND BEING INTO IT AND THEN I SAW IT ON TABLETOP AND DECIDED IT WAS WORTH A PURCHASE PRETTY QUICK AND EASY BUT IT SEEMS TO HAVE A LOT OF DEPTH AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OPTIMISING PLAY WE SHOULD HAVE STARTED GETTING DEDICATIONS WAY EARLIER AS YOU CAN ONLY GET ONE PER TURN I BELIEVE AND THERE'S ONLY SO MANY TURNS
WALK THE PLANK THE SECOND OF MY VISITING FRIEND'S ACQUISITIONS THIS IS SUCH A FUN PARTY GAME I GUESS IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO GET BIT MECHANICALLY WE LIKED IT SO MUCH WE PLAYED IT FOUR TIMES AND IT'LL DEFINITELY BE A GAME I RECOMMEND IN FUTURE

MACHI BORO IT'S A PRETTY CHILL GAME MAKES ME ITCH FOR CATAN WHICH I SHOULD BE PLAYING THIS WEEK WOOHOO

ON THE TOPIC OF BLOATED GAMES THE CRISIS HEROES AND EVENTS EXPANSIONS FOR STAR REALMS ARE JUST UNNECESSARY
ONLY GOT TO PLAY ONE GAME THIS WEEK

PROJECT ELITE PLAYED THREE TIMES BACK TO BACK WITH ALL THE CONTENT FROM THE KICKSTARTER THERE IS DEFINITELY A TON OF REPLACEABILITY AVAILABLE IF YOU'RE WILLING TO HAUL AROUND ALL THE EXTRAS THAT MIGHT BE USED IN A GIVEN SESSION REALLY ENJOYED IT

I'VE DEFINITELY BECOME A BIT MORE SOCIAL IN THE SENSE THAT I KNOW GOT TO PUBLIC METUMPS AND JUST START TALKING TO RANDOM STRANGERS ABOUT GAMING

2 POSTHUMA ANOTHER KICKSTARTER GAME I BACKED THE GAME DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT WANTS TO DO IT HAS TONS OF VERY TINY DECKS AND A LOT OF RULES AND I THINK IN TERMS OF COMPONENTS THERE IS DEFINITELY A GAME THERE BUT I DON'T THINK THE DESIGNERS FIGURED IT OUT QUITE RIGHT
GALAXY TRUCKER THIS DIDN'T GO WELL SINCE IT HAS A POORLY WRITTEN RULEBOOK JUST LIKE ALL OF GAMES MANY TIMES WE WENT BACK TRYING TO FIND HOW CERTAIN THINGS ARE PLAYED OUT AND THEY WEREN'T EXPLAINED IN THE BOOK

SECRET HITLER ONLY PLAYED WITH BUT IT WAS A BLAST I WAS ON THE LIBERAL TEAM AND WE GOT TOTALLY PLAYED BY THE GUY WHO WAS HITLER WE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE AND ELECTED HIM CHANCELLOR WAS REALLY FUN
ARCTIC SCAVENGERS X PLAYED TIMES WITH MY GROUP OF US WON TWO OUT OF THE THREE WITH WINNING SCORES OF AND AND A LOST THE THIRD GAME WITH A SCORE OF PLAYED ONCE WITH THE F WON WITH A SCORE OF TO HER FIRST TIME PLAYING THE GAME I REALLY ENJOYED IT THE THEME IS STREAMLINED AND VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD I REALLY LIKE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JUNKYARD AND THE SKIRMISHES GAME IS TIGHT FAST PACED AND HAS GREAT INTERACTION REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING NEW MODULES OR OUT OF
BATTLETOWN DEVASTATION OF INDENES

MY FRIEND RECENTLY GOT THIS FIGHTER TURNED BOARD GAME WE PLAYED IT TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S A SIMPLE ENOUGH PREMISE WHEN YOU'RE FIRST LEARNING THE CHARACTERS WE JUST PLAYED THROUGH THE NOVICE CHARACTERS AT FIRST BEFORE WORKING OUR WAY UP TO THE MORE COMPLICATED ONES

IT HAS A REALLY GOOD FEEL VERY LITTLE LUCK IT'S ALL ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR OPPONENT IS GOING TO DO AND COMPENSATING FOR THAT WE PLAYED MAYBE GAMES OR SO ALL OF THEM PRETTY SHORT MOST UNDER MINUTES OR SO OUR WINS WERE PRETTY MUCH SPLIT EVEN BUT THEY ALL CAME RIGHT DOWN TO THE WIRE OVERALL VERY FUN AND WITH CHARACTERS ALPHA AND BETA ATTACK DECKS AND ARENAS THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS TO PLAY THE GAME
FORBIDDEN DESERT LOST THE FIRST GAME WON THE SECOND ONE BUT PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE WE HOUSE FUDGED THE RULES A BIT WAS JUST ME AND MY WIFE PLAYING AND CONSIDERING HOW MUCH WE LOOSE AT THE GAME WE WERE OK WITH THAT HAHA
QUORIDOR BROUGHT THIS INTO WORK TO SLOWLY CONVERT MY COWORKERS INTO GAMING NERDS I THINK IT'S WORKING ONE DUDE HAS PLAYED BEFORE AND WAS QUITE GOOD AT USING WALLS FOR HIS OWN BENEFIT AS OPPOSED TO BLOCKING OTHERS MY COWORKERS REALLY LIKE THE GAME AT PLAYERS NEXT I INTRODUCE CARCASSONNE

CASTLES OF BURGUNDY BEEN WAITING TO PLAY THIS ONE VERY FUN WE ALL WANTED A 2ND PLAY BUT IT WAS TOO LATE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING INTO THOSE KNOWLEDGE TILES AS THE MAIN PART OF MY STRATEGY MY WIFE COMMENTED ON HOW SHE REALLY LIKED THE MULTIPLE PATHS TO VICTORY IN THIS ONE ALSO VANILLA EGG NOG PAIRED VERY WELL WITH THIS GAME I LOVE THE PLAYER BOARDS THERE'S A LITTLE SPOT FOR EVERYTHING EVEN YOUR DICE WHEN USED



BRUGES IT'S JUST AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE I REALLY LIKE GAMES WHERE THE CARDS HAVE MULTIPLE USES IT GIVES ME THAT SWEET LA GANJA VIBE THIS IS DEFINITELY A LIGHT GAME TO TEACH BUT HARD TO MASTER AND THE DICES MAKE FOR SOME INTERESTING AND TOUGH DECISIONS I HAVE A FEELING THIS GAME IS ON IT'S WAY INTO MY TOP
I THINK IT'S SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN CASTLES OF BURGUNDY WHICH I WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH MAYBE I SHOULD TRY IT AGAIN SOON NOW THAT I'VE FOUND A FELD GAME I REALLY LIKE
FIVE TRIBES PLAYED THIS WITH MY SON AND NEPHEW AND RESPECTIVELY THEY BOTH GRASPED THE CONCEPT AND TRIED TO FORMULATE STRATEGIES QUITE QUICKLY I LOVE THAT THERE ARE REFERENCE SHEETS FOR EACH PLAYER I THINK THAT MADE IT A LOT EASIER THE KIDS REALLY LOVED THE ARTWORK ON THE DJINN CARDS WHICH IS WHAT MADE THEM REALLY WANT TO PLAY AGAIN THEY WANTED TO SEE AND COLLECT NEW DJINNS I REALLY LOVED THE MECHANICS AND TRYING TO SEE GOOD MOVES AND TRYING TO SET UP COMBOS GOING LAST ONE ON TURN AND THEN BIDDING FOR FIRST ON THE NEXT TURN CAN BE VERY POWERFUL

FORMULA D I PLAYED TWO PLAYERS WITH THE BASIC RULES AND IT FELT KIND OF BORING THE PLAYER GAME AND ONE OF PLAYER GAMES WERE PLAYED WITH SOME OF THE ADVANCED RULES WHICH MADE IT A BIT MORE FUN I THINK THE LOW PLAYER COUNTS HURT THIS GAME BECAUSE THE TRACK ENDS UP FEELING SO EMPTY I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET A CHANCE TO TRY THIS AT PLAYERS EVEN SO MY SON AND NEPHEW ENJOYED THIS A LOT WHICH IS REASON ENOUGH TO WANT TO BRING IT OUT AGAIN

EVOLUTION THE BEGINNING ANOTHER ONE WITH MY SON AND NEPHEW THEY REALLY LIKE THE ART AND CREATING THEIR OWN SPECIES I THINK I AM GOING TO UPGRADE TO THE BASE GAME FAIRLY SOON AS THIS VERSION IS VERY LIGHT AND DOES NOT FEATURE MUCH CARD VARIETY

CARCASSONNE NOTHING TOO EXCITING TO SAY HERE THE KIDS LIKE BUILDING THE CITY AND THEY DO THEIR BEST TO PLAY THIS AS A TAKE THAT GAME
ONCE UPON A TIME PLAYED WITH MY FIANCE AND FRIEND WE HADN'T TOUCHED IT IN ABOUT TWO YEARS SO THE FIRST GAME WAS A LITTLE RUSTY AND DISJOINTED AS OUT FINAL HAPPY ENDING CARDS WERE VERY DIFFERENT THE SECOND PLAY THROUGH WAS FANTASTIC AND THE STORY STAYED FAIRLY COHERENT AS ALL OUR ENDING ACTUALLY WORKED TOGETHER IT WAS QUITE ENJOYABLE FIRST GAME WON BY THE FIANCE SECOND BY MY FRIEND

LORD OF AIDIT ANOTHER GAME WE HADN'T TOUCHED FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR SO WE WENT MONSTER KILL CRAZY AND THE 4TH PLAYER AI WENT NUTS IN THE END MY FIANCE KNEW SHE WASN'T GOING TO WIN BUMPED UP THE AIS TOWERS NUMBER AND DOOMED US ALL TO A LOSS AT THE HANDS OF THE AI

LORDS OF WATERDEEP HADN'T PLAYED THIS ONE FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS AS WELL WE FINISHED THE DAY WITH THIS ONE SINCE IT'S A LIGHT WORKER PLACEMENT FIANCE HAD NEVER PLAYED IT BEFORE AND SHE QUITE LIKED IT WHICH WAS GREAT BECAUSE SHE'S USUALLY WARY OF LARGE BOARDED WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES SHE ENDED UP WINNING BY HAVING THE BUILDING LORD AND HAVING BUILT ABOUT BUILDINGS ON THE BOARD
RACE FOR THE GALANY STARTING OUT WITH THE REBEL CANTINA PEACEFULLY COLONIZING FIVE MILITARY REBEL WORLDS AND FINALLY SUBJUGATING THEM ALL BY PLAYING THE GALACTIC IMPERIUM KINDA MADE ME FEEL LIKE A MACHIAVELLIAN SCUMBAG BUT THAT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE INTERESTING STORIES THIS GAME WEAVES

WONDERS STILL LOVE THIS GAME EVEN THOUGH RACE PLAYS IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LEAGUE

PORT ROYALE WONDERFUL FILLER GAME AND SIGH ALL I NEEDED WAS A 2 VP CARD TO WIN THIS GAME AS THE FINAL ACTIVE PLAYER AND THEN I DRAW ONE SHIP AFTER ANOTHER AND KNOW I'M DOOMED

MIKAL FINALLY I'VE GOTTEN IT TO THE TABLE AND IT PROVED TO BE WORTHY OF ALL THE PRAISE IT'S GOTTEN YES IT IS A PONDEROUS GAME AND IT TOOK US THREE HOURS BUT NOONE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE DOWNTIME BECAUSE YOU'RE ALSO SO ENGAGED IN THE MOVES OF YOUR OPPONENTS AS EVERYTHING THEY DO ALSO AFFECTS YOUR NEXT MOVE IT'S REALLY A FINE EXAMPLE OF AN GAME WITH TONS OF DEPTH AND IN MY OPINION TOTALLY UNDESERVING OF NOT BEING IN THE TOP ON BG
QUESTIONS FIRST

I'M THANKFUL IN REGARDS TO GAMES NOTICE I DIDN'T EXPLICITLY SAY BOARDGAMES BECAUSE AS A CHILD WE DIDN'T HAVE CABLE SATELLITE TV SO AT ALL OF OUR HOLIDAY GATHERINGS OF FAMILY WE PLAYED GAMES DOMINOS CARD GAMES OF TRUMP OR SETBACK AND DICTIONARY I ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING A SET OF CODENAMES TO REPLACE DICTIONARY BUT THE GATHERINGS AREN'T AS BIG ANYMORE MY PARENTS ARE WELL INTO THEIR AND THAT THEY STILL PLAY GAMES IS WONDERFUL MORE THAN NOT BEING AT WORK FOR A BIT THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

IT'S NOT HALF-BACKED BUT BATTLETOWN DEVASTATION OF INDENES IS FULL BEYOND BELIEF ALMOST STAGGERINGLY FULL I HEARD AN OLD-TIME TALK ABOUT THE GAME AND THEY SAID THAT THE FAN REACTION AFTER WAR WAS WE WANT BOAR AND DEBTOR SAID YOU WANT MORE FINE I'LL GIVE YOU MORE AND TURNED ON THE FIRE HOSE OF SORTS I HONESTLY WISH I PLAYED MORE OF THIS BESIDES THAT CARCASSONNE IS BLOATED NOW AT BEST YOU END UP DOING IT AS A MODULE SYSTEM WHERE YOU PLAY WITH THE FIRST EXPANSION OR TWO AND PICK A THIRD TO FOCUS ON FOR THAT GAME

GAMES THIS PAST WEEK

PARIS CONNECTION FINALLY REALLY KICKED INTO HIGH GEAR THIS WEEK AS THE AMAZON SALE GOT ENOUGH COPIES IN TOWN TO REALLY SATURATE THE GROUP THERE WERE TWO COPIES FOR GAMES LAST TUESDAY ALONE I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING THIS TO THANKSGIVING

BURGLE BROS GETTING THE HANG OF IT I STILL LIKE IT AND I'M GLAD WE HAVE A COPY IN THE GROUP THAT SAID BECAUSE WE HAVE A COPY AND THE DURATION IT TAKES TO GET THROUGH A GAME I DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO OWN IT MYSELF I'D BE INTERESTED TO TRY A SOLO SESSION OF PAWNS JUST TO SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT

AN INFAMOUS TRAFFIC SO I SETUP AND DID 2 DEMO GAMES AND A THIRD WHICH WAS ABORTED ONCE I REALIZED AN ERROR I HAD IN THE RULES IT'S DIFFERENT I THINK IN SOME WAYS I CAME INTO IT WITH A PRECONCEIVED NOTION FROM PLAYING CONTAINER A BUNCH AS THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY PART OF THE INITIAL DESIGN I SEE THE INFLUENCE IN PLACES BUT IT'S DIFFERENT THE SHARED ALLIANCES ARE MORE SUBTLE A COUPLE OF THINGS COME TO MIND FIRST THE RULEBOOK HAS PROBLEMS NOT A LOT OF EXAMPLES SOME AMBIGUITY AS NOT ALL OF THE RULES ARE IN THE RULEBOOK BUT INSTEAD ON THE MAP AND A COUPLE OF TYPOS THAT GIVE YOU PAUSE I THINK I'VE JUST ABOUT GOTTEN IT ALL SORTED OUT TO THE POINT WHERE I COULD DOING A LESSON PLAN AND TEACH IT AND I THINK I WILL NEXT WEEK AT EITHER OUR LOCAL CON OR AT THE GAME NIGHT BEFORE AS SOMEONE ELSE ON BG PUT IT THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO CUT OUT SOMEONE AT THE KNEES REVENUE IS SUPER EASY TO GET RID OF BUT SORT OF TOUGH TO ACQUIRE AT TIMES AND IN SOME WAYS IT REMINDS ME OF FM IN THAT IT'S A GAME WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO SCREW UP STILL NOT SURE HOW THE PRIZES AFFECT THE DYNAMIC OF THE GAME I ASSUMED THAT THE FIRST THREE ROUNDS WERE ALWAYS LARGELY A CONSERVATION OF REVENUE INSTEAD OF USING IT TO BOOST YOUR SCION MAYBE NOT

REGARDING TOO MUCH BLOAT I'M GOING TO PICK TWO SACRED COW GAMES GAMES THAT PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY ADORE

TERRA MYSTIC THAT POWER ROTATION CONVERSION CIRCLE THING SEEMS LIKE AN ARTIFICIAL GAMEY MECHANIC THROWN IN JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT TO ME ALONG WITH THE REWARDS THAT IT GIVES THE REWARD TILES FROM THE CULT TRACK ALSO SEEM LIKE BLOAT TO ME AS DOES THE WHOLE CULT TRACK HONESTLY THERE'S NOTHING LIKE WAITING MINUTES WHILE SOMEONE LOOKS AT EACH AND EVERY REWARD TILE BEFORE CHOOSING ONE

2 MILLENNIUM BLADES TOO MANY CARDS AND COMBOS I KNOW CCC LOVERS WILL DISAGREE PASSIONATELY WITH ME ON THIS ONE BUT IT FEELS TO ME LIKE YOU EITHER SPEND A MILLION YEARS LEARNING THE CARDS AND COMBOS OR ELSE THE GAME IS ESSENTIALLY RANDOM EVERYONE GRABS SOME STUFF AND THE PERSON WHO PICKS ROCK WHILE EVERYONE ELSE GRABS SCISSORS WINS
IT WAS MY MONTHLY BOARD GAME DAY THIS PAST SATURDAY WHILE PEOPLE WERE SHOWING UP WE PLAYED A FEW GAMES OF DON'T MESS WITH CTHULHU WHICH IS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME

WE THEN SPLIT OFF INTO TWO GAMES THE BF RAN A PLAYER GAME OF FORBIDDEN STARS AND I RAN AN PLAYER GAME OF ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE NORMALLY WE ALWAYS DO HARD MISSIONS ON HUGE MAPS BUT THAT WASN'T THE PLAN FOR THE DAY SO I JUST SET UP A MEDIUM DIFFICULTY ONE THAT WOULD HANDLE THE PLAYER COUNT WHICH PRETTY MUCH MEANT AN EASY AND RELATIVELY SHORT GAME FOR MY GROUP

AFTER WE FINISHED WE SPLIT INTO TWO GAMES AS FORBIDDEN STARS WAS STILL GOING ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS INTERESTED IN TRYING ISTANBUL SO ENDED UP DOING A PLAYER GAME OF THAT THE FRIEND WHO WANTED TO TRY IT TOOK AWHILE TO GET A HANG OF IT BUT THEN SHE OFTEN HAS TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING GAMES RIGHT AWAY I ENDED UP WINNING SINCE I WAS THE ONE PERSON EXPERIENCED WITH THE GAME BUT EVERYONE ELSE DID A RESPECTABLE JOB AND HAD FUN

EVERYONE THEN TOOK A FOOD MUNCHING BREAK AS THE FORBIDDEN STARS WRAPPED UP COUPLE OF PEOPLE HAD TO LEAVE SO WE MOVED ON TO TWO PLAYER GAMES NEXT I ENDED UP SHOWING PEOPLE DEAD OF WINTER THE LONG NIGHT WHILE THE BF RAN POSTHUMA ENDED UP DOING THE SURVIVE ROUNDS OBJECTIVE FOR DOW AND WE PLAYED WITH RAXXON AND COLONY UPGRADES ALSO PLAYED AS A GAME WITH SECRET OBJECTIVES MANY CHARACTERS DIED DURING THE GAME AND TRYING TO KEEP ON TOP OF THE CRISIS OBJECTIVES WAS A PAIN BUT LIFE GOT A LITTLE BETTER AFTER WE MADE THE GREENHOUSE AND WERE WERE ABLE TO LIMP OUR WAY TO A WIN I ENDED UP BEING THE ONLY PERSON TO NOT GET THEIR PERSONAL OBJECTIVE I JUST NEEDED FOOD CARDS AND EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE GETTING THEM BUT ME

EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT PART OF IT I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR POSTHUMA WENT OVER WELL PEOPLE HAD BEEN WANTING TO PLAY IT FOR MONTHS BUT IT KEPT NOT HITTING THE TABLE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER ONLY COMPLAINT WAS THE LACK OF DICE WHICH I'D HAVE MORE DICE BY NOW IF THE CARDANUS ORDER THEY ARE IN WASN'T STILL BEING HELD UP BY THE ALIENS LEGENDARY EXPANSION PANDEMIC IBERIA RELEASE DELAYS SUCK GRUMBLE GRUMBLE

AFTER THESE TWO GAMES ENDED WE WERE JUST LEFT WITH SO ENDED UP PLAYING ROLL FOR THE GALAXY AS THE LAST GAME OF THE NIGHT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME PLAYING FOR ME AND I PRETTY MUCH SPENT HALF OF THE GAME COMPLETELY CONFUSED AS TO WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THE PLAYER SHIELD HAD A TON OF INFORMATION ON IT BUT EVEN WHEN THE GAME BEGAN TO MAKE SENSE IT ALL STILL READ LIKE GIBBERISH TO ME BUT DESPITE MY CONFUSION I CAME IN SECOND PLACE BEHIND THE PERSON WHO OWNED THE GAME I CHALK IT UP TO GENERALLY BEING GOOD AT OPTIMIZATION PUZZLES AND I MANAGED TO OPTIMIZE THE CRAP OUT OF WHAT I ACTUALLY DID UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE GAME I'D PROBABLY EASILY PLAY FTG AGAIN SOMETIME THOUGH IT IS NOT LIKELY TO END UP ON MY WISH LIST ANYTIME SOON

STUFFING WHAT GAMES FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN STUFFED FULL OF TOO MANY THINGS AND HAVE BECOME TOO BLOATED OR HALF BAKED

YOU CAN PROBABLY INSERT MOST ADVENTURE STYLE GAMES HERE THERE ARE A COUPLE I DO ENJOY DESPITE THEIR BLOAT LIKE FORTUNE GLORY BUT I REALLY HAVE TO BE IN A SPECIFIC MOOD TO SIT DOWN AND PLAY THEM
NEW BEDFORD LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT SO FAR MAYBE SOMETHING NEGATIVE WILL POP UP AFTER MORE PLAYS BUT SO FAR IT'S ALL GOOD THE AI WORKS GREAT TOO

EMPIRE LEGENDS THIS A GREAT LITTLE GAME AND I HAVEN'T EVEN GOT TO TRY THE VARIANTS YET I THINK IT HAS SATISFIED MY NEED FOR AN AREA CONTROL GAME WITH COMBAT NOW I WANT OTHER RYAN LATUKA GAMES

TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES THE MARCY CASE OUR SECOND RUN PRETTY SURE WE KNOW HOW TO SOLVE IT FOR OUR NEXT RUN

JAIPUR TAUGHT MY SISTER AND WON

COSMIC RUN PLAYED SOLO AND LOST

MULTIUNIVERSUM PLAYED SOLO AND LOST

DIAMANT PLAYED IN A GROUP AT MY FAGS AND I LOST BY ONE GEM

THE RESISTANCE PLAYED WITH A GROUP OF STRANGERS I WAS A SPY AND HAD THEM ALL BELIEVING I WASN'T THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN LIE THAT WELL WELL APPARENTLY THERE IS I'VE PLAYED THIS BEFORE

SURVIVE ESCAPE FROM ATLANTIS FIRST TIME PLAYING THIS ONE AND I WON ALL OF THE OTHER PLAYERS HAD PLAYED IT BEFORE IT WAS PRETTY FUN I THOUGHT IT FELT OLD SO WASN'T SURPRISED WHEN I LOOKED IT UP AND SAW IT WAS DESIGNED IN THE VOLCANO TILE WAS THE LAST ONE ON THE BOARD

CLICK CLACK LUMBERJACK GOT THIS FOR MY KID'S 4TH BIRTHDAY AND WE PLAYED IT A FEW TIMES HE ENJOYS IT A LOT AND IT'S ONE OF THE GAMES TO PLAY WITH HIM AS LONG AS I GET HELP SETTING IT UP AND HE'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO PLAY PROPERLY

I'M THANKFUL THAT IT'S GOT ME SOCIALIZING MORE THAN I USED TO I'D OFTEN JUST STAY HOME AND PLAY GUITAR OR DRUMS OR VIDEO GAMES BUT NOW I GET OUT AND MEET TOTAL STRANGERS AT MY FAGS

2 CAN'T ANSWER THAT ONE I'M PRETTY SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT I BUY AND PLAY SO I HAVEN'T REALLY RUN INTO THIS PROBLEM YET
DIXIT CAN BE QUITE TRICKY TO FIND THE RIGHT CARD WHEN THIS MANY ARE ON THE TABLE USED THE VARIANT WHERE YOU CAN VOTE FOR 2 CARDS LIMITING HERE WASN'T THE SIZE OF THE TABLE BUT HOW EVERYONE IS SEATED AROUND IT USING A SMALL TABLE IN THE MIDDLE INSTEAD OF A LONG ONE WORKS BETTER



WIZARD WAS OKAY I FIND IT DRAGS ON FOR THE TYPE OF GAME IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE MORE THAN MINUTES FOR A FILLER FEELS WASTED
MARKHAM HORROR CG DANAAN PLAYS THIS WEEK I NEVER PLAY GAMES THAT MANY TIMES LET ALONE SOLO THIS GAME IS SO FREAKING GOOD STARTED THE CAMPAIGN WITH ONE OF MY GROUPS AND GOT THROUGH THE 2ND SCENARIO PLAYING IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN SOLO AND A LOT OF FUN THOUGH A BIT CHAOTIC CAN'T WAIT TO KEEP GOING WITH THIS AND FOR MORE SCENARIOS DOWN THE ROAD I'M HOOKED FOR SURE

A TEAM GAME WHERE YOU HELP ALADDIN GET GEMS OR SOMETHING IT WAS SURPRISINGLY FUN AND CLEVER HOPE TO TRY WITH THE FULL PLAYER COUNT SOON BUT EVEN TRYING WITH OR SHOULD BE FUN MAYBE OVER THE HOLIDAY

THE GRIZZLED A COUPLE GAMES THIS GAME IS FINE AT BUT NOTHING SPECIAL NOTHING REALLY NOTABLE EXCEPT WE WON 2 LOST YAYYY



THANKFUL FOR THE FRIENDSHIP AND COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OUT OF THIS HOBBY

2 MOST OF THE FFA MARKHAM PROPERTIES HOPE THEY DON'T DO THAT TO THE CG


ANOTHER NICE PLAY THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING I SEEM TO OVERDO OR OVERLOOK IN THIS GAME REALLY HARD FOR ME TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THE INTERLOCKING MECHANICS AND THEREBY COMPETE WITH GOOD PLAYERS BUT I STILL LOVE IT SO

BRUXELLES

I WON IN THE SAME WAY I LOST LAST WEEKEND'S PLAY DOING TO THE OTHER GUY WHAT HE DID TO ME DOMINATE THE AREA CONTROL SHIELD POINTS ON THE BOARD AND IGNORE THE BRUSSELS BOARD ALTOGETHER HE LIKED THE GAME LESS BECAUSE NOW THAT TRACK TO VICTORY SOMEHOW DICTATES PLAY BUT I THINK HE'S MAYBE HAVING A TINY BIT OF SOUR GRAPES FINDING HIS PREVIOUSLY USED STRATEGY USED SO EFFECTIVELY AGAINST HIMSELF BUT I LIKED IT MORE ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES SO GLAD I PICKED IT UP THIS WAS MY 6TH PLAY I WILL TRY TO GET IT UP TO TEN PLAYS SOON

DOMINION

THE FAGS SET WAS A MESS BUT AFTER ORGANIZING WE MANAGED TWO PLAYS RANDOMIZED WITH MOST SETS I WON THE FIRST GAME YAY

FOR SALE

AND TAUGHT THIS GAME NICE FILLER WILL ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION SOMEDAY OBVIOUSLY NO RUSH BECAUSE THE GAME IS EVERYWHERE

SPLENDOR

TWO QUICK GAMES HELPED A FRIEND OUT BY INTRODUCING SOME OF THE MY BASIC WINNING I THINK STRATEGIES FOR THE GAME THANKS TO THAT SHE WON THE 2ND GAME WE PLAYED

PATCHWORK

I LOST BECAUSE I DIDN'T GO AFTER ENOUGH PATCHES EARLY SO EVEN THOUGH I GOT THE TILE I STILL LOST BECAUSE SHE HAD THE MOST BUTTONS COINS LEFT OVER HAVEN'T QUITE FIGURED THIS OUT OTHER THAN GET BUTTONS NONETHELESS NICE FILLER AS ALWAYS

HANSA TEUTONIA

TAUGHT TO TWO NEWIES WHICH CAN BE A CHALLENGE AS THERE AREN'T TOO MANY GAMES LIKE THIS ONE IT'S DEFINITELY A GAME WHERE YOU THE TEACHER CAN TEACH CAREFULLY ALL THE RULES BUT ONE OR TWO ARE INEVITABLY FORGOTTEN AND YOU ARE LEFT TO BLAME ONE PLAYER REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT AND HAD TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING IT MIXING UP JUMBLING THE ACTION AND LIBER SOPHIA TRACKS MEANINGS DESPITE WHAT I THOUGHT WERE CLEAR EXPLANATIONS THE OTHER PLAYER I TAUGHT SEEMED TO LIKE IT AND WON HANDILY I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT RUBS SOME PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY

GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL

NOT GOOD FOR MY COLORBLIND FIEND HE KEPT CONFUSING THE RED AND BROWN CUBES NOT COOL REDUCES MY RATING SOMEWHAT AND MAKES ME RECOMMIT TO MAKING ANYTHING I CREATE COLORBLIND FRIENDLY STILL I LIKE THIS GAME AND AS SOON AS I CONFIRM THAT I HAVE A 2ND EDITION IN MY HANDS I WILL LIKELY BUY IT HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE FAGS COPY FOR NOW THE DICE ROLLS IN THIS PARTICULAR GAME LENDED THEMSELVES TO A WEIRD ENDING AND SO THE GAME KIND OF FIZZLED WITH NEITHER OF US BEING ABLE TO DO VERY MUCH STILL I LIKE IT

PANDEMIC LEGACY

WOW CARNAGE DEATH DISEASE DEATH SO SAD

SPOILERS JUNE

WOW DID WE JUST DIE S WOW DID WE JUST DIE AND DO POORLY WE LOST JUNE FIRST ATTEMPT CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE WE CURED YELLOW SUPER EARLY BUT MY COWORKER REFUSED TO PLAY ALONG HOPING THAT HE'D DRAW A YELLOW CARD OR TWO AS OPPOSED TO GETTING THEM FROM ME BUT OF COURSE HE DIDN'T AND NATURALLY YELLOW THEN WENT OUT OF CONTROL SO WE LOST A GAME THEN THE NEXT ATTEMPT AT JUNE AND UTTER UTTER DISASTER VERY EARLY IN THE GAME OUR HEAVILY UP MEDIC RUSHED IN TO DEAL WITH A UPCOMING FADED OUTBREAK HE SAW COMING THANKS TO HIS FORECASTER UPGRADE ABILITY GOT CAUGHT UP IN ANOTHER
UNRELATED VERY VERY UNLUCKY FADED OUTBREAK AND GOT HIS SECOND AND THIRD SCAR AND DIED OUR HEAVILY UPGRADED MEDIC WHO HAD THE ADJACENT CITY CURE ABILITY NONETHELESS OZZY HUGGINKISS IS DEAD NOT ONLY THAT BUT ANOTHER PLAYER COULD HAVE USED HIS ONE QUIET NIGHT CARD TO PREVENT HIS GETTING THE THIRD SCAR BUT FORGOT IT WAS IN HIS HAND SIGH VERY DISHEARTENING IS THE GAME HOPELESS WITHOUT MEDIC I KNOW I KNOW HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN NEAR FADED FIGURES AT ALL WITH THE ONE SCAR LESSON LEARNED I WE SELDOM PLAY PANDEMIC VANILLA OR LEGACY WITHOUT HIM AND WHEN WE DON'T WE LOSE OH WELL TWO LOSES IN A ROW AND NOW THE FADED HAVE TAKEN OVER ALL OF ASIA WITH FOOTHOLDS IN BLACK CHENNAI AND BLUE LOS ANGELES HOPING ANOTHER MEDIC IS IN THE FOUR LOSES IN A ROW BOX WE WERE DOING SO WELL UP TO THIS POINT TOO SIGH

ORA ET LABARA

LONG LONG HOUR GAME TO END SUNDAY NIGHT FINISHED AT ALMOST COULD HAVE WON HAD I PLACED THE VILLAGES DURING SETTLEMENT PHASES BETTER HAD THE POINTS JUST BADLY ORGANIZED ON THE BOARD I GUESS I WAS HOPING TO FILL IN MORE SPACES LATER ON BUT DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE LOTS OF ANALYSIS PARALYSIS THAT I CAN FORGIVE AS THERE IS SO SO SO VERY MUCH TO DO IN THIS GAME ALWAYS ONE OF MY FAVORITES NONETHELESS WILL KEEP IT IN ROTATION FOR NOW TO GET TO PLAYS AT LEAST THIS WAS MY 9TH PLAY OF THE GAME

EDIT FIXED SPOILERS BIT
LIGHT GAMING WEEK AFTER A LONG KEEKED OF GAMING

ON MONDAY WE PLAYED OUR NEWLY ACQUIRED MYSTIC VALE WE COULDN'T END THE GAME ON SUNDAY MY SO REALLY LIKED IT SAME FOR ME

ON THURSDAY WE WANTED TO PLAY ANOTHER GAME OF MYSTIC VALE BUT IT WAS ALREADY PRETTY LATE WE DIDN'T GET ANY POINT CARDS SO THE GAME LASTED WAY TOO LONG WAS A BIT UNLUCKY AND THE EXPERIENCE WASN'T THAT GOOD PROBABLY AN ONE-OFF I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE THINK THE REPLACEABILITY IS THERE AREN'T THAT MANY CARDS BUT IF YOU JUST ROTATE THE GAME ENOUGH THE CARDS WILL KEEP FRESH

NOT SURE IF I WANT TO PLAY FOR THE EXPANSION FOR JUST A BUNGE OF CARDS ALSO THE REVIEWS ABOUT IT WEREN'T THAT GREAT JUST A SO-SO EXPANSION EXPANDING ON THE EXISTING CARD POOL DUNNO ABOUT IT

ON SATURDAY WE PLAYED TWO GAMES OF SPYFAULT AND AGAIN IT WAS SO-SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT GROUP FOR IT THE GAME IS JUST NOT THAT STRUCTURED SO FOR CASUAL GAMERS IT'S REALLY HARD TO FORMULATE QUESTIONS PERHAPS NEXT TIME I'LL TELL THEM TO IGNORE THE ROLE AND TO JUST GO FOR THE LOCATION AS IS MAYBE THAT WAY IT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT EASIER I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO BALANCE ON THE GREY AREA OF QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS THIS HAS A CHANCE OF LEAVING MY COLLECTION

TONIGHT IT'S TROYES TIME OOOOOH YEAH
NOT TOO MANY GAMES THIS WEEK HAPPY I GOT A FEW IN

BROOM SERVICE PICKED UP THIS GAME AFTER A FLASH DEAL ON AMAZON PLAYED IT WITH A ROOMMATE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND VERY FUN FAST EASY TO TEACH WE PLAYED THE SIMPLE SIDE OF THE BOARD I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO JUMPING INTO THE DEEPER SIDE OF THE BOARD

ANDROID NETRUNNER CORE BOX TRADED FOR THIS GAME A FEW MONTHS AGO AND FINALLY WAS ABLE TO PLAY IT WITH MY CCC OBSESSED FRIEND HE PURCHASED THE GAME FROM AMAZON WHILE WE WERE PLAYING OUR SECOND GAME I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW CAMPAIGN THAT IS COMING OUT

I WANTED TO PLAY MORE GAMES THIS WEEK JUST HARD WITH ONLY 2 PLAYERS TO PLAY SOME HEAVIER GAMES NONETHELESS

TICKET TO RIDE SUCH A FUN GAME EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND BOTH MY GIRLFRIEND AND I LOVE TO TRAVEL SO IT KIND OF REACHES A SOFT SPOT IN OUR HEARTS SHE WON THE FIRST GAME AND I WON THE SECOND GAME

ZOMBIE DICE JUST A QUICK GAME I THOUGHT I WOULD BRING TO WORK AND WE CAN PLAY IN THE DOWNTIME MY CO-WORKER PICKED IT UP SUPER QUICKLY AND WE HAD QUITE A BIT OF FUN
WE HELD THE ASMOPLAY MYSTERIUM EVENT PEOPLE SHOWED UP BOTH GHOSTS GOT GHOST MASKS THE TOP GOT THE PROMO PSYCHIC TOKENS EVERYONE ELSE GOT THE PROMO CARD
GOT A FEW IN THIS WEEKEND ON SATURDAY WE PLAYED TWO GAMES OF RONIN WE REALLY LIKE ASYMMETRICAL TWO PLAYER GAMES AND THIS ONE IS NO DIFFERENT FIRST COUPLE OF PLAYS I FELT A BIT LOST JUST PUTTING MY PIECES DOWN AND SEEING WHAT HAPPENS IT SLOWLY BEGINS TO CLICK THOUGH I WAS THE RONIN AND H THE NINJAS FIRST GAME WE SWITCHED THE ROLES SECOND GAME SHE KILLED OFF FOUR OF MY RONIN BEFORE I WON THE FIRST GAME I SOMEHOW DID NOT KILL ANY OF HER RONIN IN THE SECOND GAME SMALL SAMPLE SIZE BUT AFTER THREE GAMES PLAYED THE NINJAS HAVE NOT WON A GAME I DO THINK IT S GAME THAT REWARDS LOTS OF PLAYS WITH THE SAME PLAYERS LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING IT AGAIN LATELY I VE BEEN MORE CRITICAL ABOUT FLAWS IN GAMES AND I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT LEARNING THE GAME WOULD BE WAY EASIER IF THE SYMBOLS ON THE CENTER MAP AND PLAYER SCREENS WERE ALSO ON THE PLAYER MAPS NO REASON THEY SHOULDN T BE DRIVES ME CRAZY

ENDED THE NIGHT WITH A CASUAL GAME OF JAIPUR ALWAYS A LIGHT FAVORITE FOR US H WON THIS MATCH

SATURDAY WE GOT A COUPLE IN AS WELL STARTED WITH DIMENSION THE NEWEST GAME TO OUR COLLECTION SOLITAIRE PUZZLE GAME WHERE YOU STACK DIFFERENT COLORED BALLS INTO A PYRAMID SHAPE WHILE TRYING TO FULFILL SIX RULES CARDS AND DO IT UNDER A MINUTE DECEPTIVELY HARD IT LOOKS LIKE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT PERFECT EACH TIME BUT WE MADE MISTAKES CONSTANTLY THE CONTRADICTING RULES CARDS ARE FRUSTRATING AT FIRST BUT I REALLY THINK THAT S JUST PART OF THE GAME IT PLAYS SO FAST THAT THERE S NO REASON TO GET MAD ABOUT IT I WON BOTH GAMES WE PLAYED

ENDED WITH A GAME OF THE ORDER OF THE GILDED COMPASS I MENTIONED WHERE I VE BEEN MORE CRITICAL OF FLAWS LATELY WELL THIS GAME HAS A FEW THE WASHED OUT COLORS ON THE SPECIALIST TILES AND MAP TILES ARE TERRIBLE THERE S A MAP COLOR TILE THAT IS WILD IN THE GAME BUT WE COULD NOT FIND ANY MENTION OF IT IN THE RULES OR IF IT REALLY FUNCTIONS ANY DIFFERENTLY ALSO THE INSERT AND THE BAGS THAT COME WITH THE GAME ARE ABSURD THE INSERT HAS SLOTS TO FIT SOME OF THE TILES IN THE GAME BUT NOT NEARLY ENOUGH IT DOES COME WITH PLASTIC BAGGIES BUT IT DOESN T COME WITH ENOUGH BAGGIES AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO CRAM SOME OF THE TILES IN THEM FOR THEM TO FIT REALLY POOR PLANNING FOR GAME WITH A TON OF DIFFERENT PIECES THAT BEING SAID I DO REALLY LIKE THIS GAME DICE PLACEMENT WITH AN INDIANA JONES AORTA THEME WE VE ONLY PLAYED THE TWO PLAYER GAME WHERE THERE ARE LESS BUILDINGS I THINK THE TWO PLAYER GAME WITH MORE BUILDINGS AND A DUMMY PLAYER WILL BE EVEN BETTER FUN LIGHT BUT WITH SOME GOOD DECISIONS SCORING GETS A BIT FIDDLY WHEN YOU RE DECIDING WHERE TO PLACE YOUR SPECIALISTS ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SOME OF THE SECRET PLANNING CARDS THAT LET YOU PLAY SPECIALISTS ON THOSE BUT I LIKE IT EITHER WAY I WON OUR PLAY OF IT

QUESTIONS

I'M THANKFUL IT'S A HOBBY I CAN SHARE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND

KANKAN WAS KINDA LIKE THIS FOR US TOO CONVOLUTED BOARD WAY TOO BUSY FOR OUR TASTES LE HAVRE ALSO KINDA FITS THIS WAY TOO MANY PIECES WAY TOO LONG FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING

PRETTY PACKED WEEK LIBRARY AT WORK DID A FRIDAY AFTERNOON THING FOR INTERNATIONAL GAME DAY SINCE WE'RE CLOSED ON SATURDAY DID SOME GAMING ON REAL IND AND SOME AT THE OFFICE

MACHS VS MINIONS PLAYED TWO GAMES OF MACHS VS MINIONS WITH THE GUYS AT WORK AND WE WON BOTH SCENARIOS AS PREDICTED THEY LOVE THE GAME AND I DO TOO WE'RE STARTING UP THE THIRD SCENARIO TODAY I ENDED UP BEING A REALLY CLUTCH PLAYER IN THE SECOND SCENARIO KEEPING AN ENTIRE WING OF THE PLAY AREA UNDER LOCK AND WINNING THE GAME AT THE END

FORBIDDEN DESERT TWO GAMES OF FORBIDDEN DESERT AT THE LIBRARY AND WE LOST HORRIBLY BOTH TIMES DUE TO MISMANAGEMENT OF WATER I REALLY DO LIKE THIS GAME AND FOR SOME REASON I FIND IT EASIER NOT TO QUARTERBACK THAN I DO WITH PANDEMIC ALTHOUGH CONSIDERING HOW POORLY WE DID

THE RESISTANCE RAN INTO SOME STUDENTS AT THE LIBRARY WHO WERE SUPER EXCITED TO PLAY THIS SO WE DID I WAS ON THE WINNING SIDE ALL THREE GAMES REALLY HAD TO STOP MYSELF FROM GIVING THE TRICK AWAY WHEN I A SPY WAS SENT ON A MISSION THAT WOULD WIN US THE GAME AND IT GOT APPROVED FUN BUT A LOT MORE FUN WITH MORE PEOPLE AND SINCE I DON'T PLAY WITH THAT MANY TYPICALLY IT'S WHY I GOT RID OF IT

LASCAUX FUN LITTLE BIDDING AUCTION GAME THAT PLAYS LIGHTNING QUICK I TIED FOR VICTORY THANKS TO MY BIG MONEY BIGGER RHINOS STRATEGY THAT I EXECUTED ALMOST BY ACCIDENT

FIVE TRIBES TAUGHT THIS GAME TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT AND I THINK THEY ALL ENDED UP LIKING IT DESPITE BEING TERRIFIED OF IT AT FIRST I ENDED UP WINNING BY SOME MARGIN AND WOULD HAVE WON BY MORE IF I HADN'T COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE SECOND HALF OF THE VIZIR SCORING I NEGLECTED TO EXPLAIN IT AND I NEGLECTED TO REMEMBER IT SO WE JUST OMITTED IT FROM SCORING REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS GAME EVEN THOUGH IT OCCASIONALLY BOGS DOWN AS I LOOK FOR A MOVE ANY MOVE OH GOD THERE HAS TO BE A MOVE SOMEWHERE ON THIS BOARD

LORDS OF WATERDEEP FIRST TIME PLAYING WITH THE SCOUNDRELS OF SKULLPORT EXPANSION AND THE LAST TIME I WILL PLAY WITHOUT IT AS IT GREATLY IMPROVES THE GAME FOR NOT THAT MUCH MORE COMPLEXITY FIRST GAME WAS A DISASTER AS I JUST GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT FURTHERED ANY OF MY GOALS SECOND GAME WAS MUCH BETTER AS I RAN A TIGHT RACE WITH THE EVENTUAL WINNER I THINK I LIKE THIS MORE THAN VITICULTURE AS AN INTRO TO WORKER PLACEMENT BUT NOT QUITE AS MUCH AS STONE AGE



I'M THANKFUL TO BOARD GAMES FOR GETTING ME OUT OF MY HOUSE AND INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE BEFORE I BECAME A CREEPY SHUT-IN

EVEN THOUGH I'VE ONLY PLAYED IT ONCE I'D SAY A FEAST FOR ODIN IT'S STILL A VERY GOOD GAME BUT THERE'S JUST SO MUCH GOING ON THAT IT'S HARD TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND

LEWIS CLARK IF I HAD A TOP GAME THIS WOULD BE IT I HAD A BIG WIN DUE TO ONE LITTLE TINY WEIRD MOVE MY OPPONENT MADE HE BASICALLY GAVE ME THE LAST MOUNTAIN MOVEMENT I NEEDED TO TAKE OFF WITH A BUNCH OF CANOES AND GET WAAAAAAY PAST THE FINISH LINE

POTION EXPLOSION I FINALLY LOST UGH I THOUGHT I HAD IT BUT ALAS THE ALCOHOL BETRAYED ME AT THE END LOL



I'M THANKFUL FOR A HOBBY THAT ACTUALLY GETS ME TO TALK TO PEOPLE I'M NOT A BIG SMALL TALKER SO IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE A SHARED EXPERIENCE THAT GIVES ME A DIVING BOARD FOR TALKING AND HAVING FUN WITH PEOPLE

ONE GAME I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS YEAR WAS BURAN BUT THAT GAME HAS WAY TOO MUCH STUFF GOING ON FOR NO REASON I PLAYED IT ONCE AND TRADED IT AWAY FOR THE INFINITELY BETTER TERRA MYSTIC BEST TRADE I'VE EVER MADE KEYFLOWER IS OVERSTUFFED IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY IT SEEMS TO HAVE EVERY MECHANISM THAT COULD BE IN A GAME BUT IT ALL WORKS FLAWLESSLY

MACHS AND MINIONS 1ST MISSION

WITNESSED THE AWESOMENESS THAT IS A STACK FUEL TANK FIRST MISSION WAS A SUCCESS WILL PLAY THE 2ND THIS UPCOMING WEEKEND WITH THE SAME GROUP

MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME TIMES SOLO TWICE WITH MY WIFE

LOVE IT

SO MUCH FLAVOR STORY BEAUTIFUL ART PACKED INTO A NICE HOUR LONG PER SCENARIO PACKAGE

I'VE ONLY PLAYED AS AGENT ROLAND AND MY WIFE THE STREET URCHIN WENDY PER ADVISED FOR FIRST TIME PLAYERS BUT MY MIND IS ALREADY ADRIFT IN IMAGINING WAYS TO IMPROVE THE DECKS 2 X AUTOS RESOURCE COST EACH WITH LIMITED AMMO DUMP THEM FROM THE DECK IT'S MACHETE TIME AND HOLY CRAP ROLAND IS NOT A TANK HIS MIND IS FRAGILE AND WEAK

ALREADY HAVE THE CURSE OF THE ROUGARUE SP STANDALONE BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET

THIS IS TREMENDOUS AND IF YOU LIKE DECK BUILDING WHICH I DO THEN EVEN THE BASE SCENARIOS IS A LOT OF CONTENT WHEN YOU ARE HAVING FUN TRYING OUT NEW BUILDS HELL EVEN IF YOU AREN'T SO INTO THAT THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT PLAYING CHARACTERS TO TRY

I THINK AGNES THE WAITRESS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST THEMATICALLY INTERESTING AND MOST INTERESTING MECHANICALLY



I'M THANKFUL FOR HAVING LARGER GROUPS TOGETHER TO PLAY HIGHER PLAY COUNT GAMES THIS THANKSGIVING THE RESISTANCE
WELCOME BACK TO THE DUNGEON JUST LIKE REGULAR TTD EXCEPT DIFFERENT CLASSES AND ENEMIES PLUS THERE'S SOME VARIABLE ENEMIES WITH CHANGING STATS BASED ON SOME FACTORS THROWS A BIT OF UNPREDICTABILITY INTO THE ENEMY DECK

ANIS STILL GOOD BUT I THINK MY RATING IS GOING TO COME DOWN A POINT OR TWO

A GAME OF THRONES HAND OF THE KING FUN FILLER THAT TAKES MAYBE MINUTES OR SO PER PLAY I'M TERRIBLE AT IT I LOST ALL FIVE GAMES I LIKE THAT THEY WENT WITH CARTOON ART INSTEAD OF GRABS FROM THE SHOW OR ART SIMILAR TO AGCT CG

WORLD'S FAIR STILL GLAD I BACKED THIS ONE ON KS IT'S A LOT OF FUN EVEN AFTER PLAYS

ROYALS WASN'T REALLY A HUGE FAN OF THIS THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED BUT PICKED IT UP ANYWAY AND AM GLAD I DID GOT MY COPY TO THE TABLE FOR THE FIRST TIME ON FRIDAY AND EVERYONE HAD A BLAST I LOST HORRIBLY BUT IT WAS STILL QUITE FUN ALSO THE BOARD IS GORGEOUS

COLONY WENT INTO THIS WITH A NEGATIVE VIEW OF THE GAME JUST BASED ON WHAT I SAW AT GENION READ IN REVIEWS ETC HONESTLY I ACTUALLY LIKED IT QUITE A BIT AND PROBABLY WILL PICK IT UP AT SOME POINT THE ONLY THING I FORESEE BEING A PROBLEM IS THE SAME PROBLEM I HAD WITH DOMINION EACH GAME YOU SET OUT NEW CARDS IN THE MARKET AND IT TAKES EVERYONE SEVERAL MINUTES TO GO THROUGH AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE

KEYFLOWER I REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THIS ONE AT NON PLAYER COUNTS I'VE COME CLOSE TO WINNING IN THE PAST NEVER HAVE ACTUALLY WON BUT THIS WAS A TERRIBLE SHOWING BY ME



GOBBLE GOBBLE THIS WEEK IT'S THANKSGIVING IN THE U SOUTH WHAT ARE YOU THANKFUL TO BOARD GAMES ABOUT

THEY'VE GIVEN ME SOMETHING RESEMBLING A SOCIAL LIFE

STUFFING WHAT GAMES FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN STUFFED FULL OF TOO MANY THINGS AND HAVE BECOME TOO BLOATED OR HALF BAKED

TWO COME TO MIND THE FIRST WAS ECLIPSE WITH THE SHADOW OF THE RIFT EXPANSION I JUST FELT LIKE IT ADDED TOO MUCH STUFF THE SECOND WAS THE GLOOMHAVEN DEMO I PLAYED AT GENION IT HAD ALL THESE GREAT IDEAS AND EXCELLENT MECHANICS YET WHEN THEY WERE ALL PUT TOGETHER I GOT THE FEELING THAT THERE WAS JUST TOO MUCH GOING ON
THAT LOOKS COOL WOULD BE GREAT TO HANG UP IN A GAMES ROOM WE ALL SIGNED THE BOARD WHEN WE'D FINISHED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE END

WE DIDN'T USE ROADBLOCKS THAT MUCH I THINK THE PEAK DIFFICULTY WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE MID YEAR FOR US
DID ANYONE ELSE FEEL THAT ONCE YOU HAD ALL THE VIRUS UPGRADES AND ROADBLOCKED CODA INTO IT'S STARTING AREA THAT THE SECOND HALF OF THE GAME WAS A DOWNHILL BATTLE

MOSTLY WE DID GET SLAMMED WITH SOME ROUGH DRAWS EVERY SO OFTEN AND A FEW OF THOSE SEARCH TRACKS WERE A PAIN BUT OVERALL THE FINAL HALF OF THE YEAR WAS A COAST TO WHAT THE GAME CALLED LEGENDARY OUR ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO NEVER LOSE TWO GAMES IN A ROW WE NEVER DID AND IT WORKED OUT WELL
IT DEPENDED ON THE GAME SOMETIMES YES BUT IN OTHERS IT FELT LIKE THE UPGRADES WERE OFFSET BY THE DAMAGE THAT HAD BEEN DONE TO CITIES WITH HARDER RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL ETC
I HAVEN'T PLAYED PANDEMIC LEGACY AND AS IT STANDS I PROBABLY NEVER WILL DUE TO THE TIME GROUP COMMITMENT BUT THAT FRAMED BOARD IS A THING OF BEAUTY VERY NICELY DONE
I THINK YOU WERE DAMN LUCKY TO NOT HAVE AN UNSTOPPABLE OUTBREAK ON CODA SPREADING IT OUTSIDE THE STARTING REGION OBVIOUSLY YOU GOT ALL ROADBLOCKS UP EVENTUALLY BUT THERE WAS STILL A FAIR WHILE WHEN YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN FULLY PROTECTED AND ALSO THAT THE STORY DIDN'T PENALISE YOU FOR ROADBLOCKS LIKE IT DID FOR A CERTAIN OTHER WE ONLY USED THEM SITUATIONALLY DIDN'T LEAVE ANY ON THE BOARD AS UPGRADES AND ENDED WITH A VICTORY WHILE FINDING THE MONTHS PRETTY EASY
WE LOST GAMES TOTAL THAT WERE ALL PRETTY SPREAD OUT HONESTLY I THOUGHT EACH GAME WAS MORE OR LESS AS HARD AS REGULAR PANDEMIC BUT THE PUNISHMENT FOR LOSING ESPECIALLY OVER A SLEW OF OUTBREAKS KEPT IT TENSE ALL THE WAY THROUGH WE EVEN LOST IN EARLY DECEMBER ONLY TO WIN ON LATE DECEMBER ON THE LAST POSSIBLE TURN WITH THE LAST ACTION
MY GROUP LOST THREE GAMES ALL YEAR THOUGH IT WAS PRETTY EASY COMPARED TO REGULAR PANDEMIC IF WE PLAYED AGAIN I'M REASONABLY SURE WE COULD GO UNDEFEATED BARRING EXTREME BAD LUCK NEEDING THREE CURES DISEASE UPGRADES STARTING STRUCTURES AND CHARACTER UPGRADES AND RELATIONSHIPS MAKE THE GAME CAKE IF YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERYTHING AVAILABLE TO YOU

STILL A GREAT GAME
SELLS

CANCELS BOOMTOWN

HEY GUYS HERE'S A NEW CARD GAME WE'LL SUPPORT IT PROMISE
I'M NOT SURE IF THIS GAME IS GOING TO BE AN AMAZING HOMAGE TO POWER CARDS BROKEN CARDS AND CREATE AN ENGAGING SYSTEM THAT MAKES BEING ON THE RECEIVING END OF THESE COMBOS AS ENJOYABLE AS DISCOVERING THEM OR IF IT'S GOING TO BE UTTER GARBAGE A SYSTEM DESIGNED AND THEN RELEASED UNDER A BROKEN CARDS ARE FUN MARKETING CAMPAIGN BECAUSE BALANCING IS A PITA

THE OLD SCHOOL CCC BROKEN CARD THING WENT AWAY FOR A REASON DEGENERATIVE COMBOS AREN'T FUN AFTER THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE THEM FOR CRYING OUT LOUD NETRUNNER HAD TO INSTITUTE A RESTRICTED LIST BECAUSE EVERYONE GOT BOARD OF THE SAME OLD SHIT

I REALLY HOPE THIS GAME WORKS BECAUSE FINDING AND EXPLOITING CLEVER COMBOS IS MY FAVORITE PART OF CONSTRUCTED CARD GAMES BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND BROKEN COMBOS EPIC GETS WAY MORE SHIT THAN IT DESERVES AND IT'S A GAME THAT REVELS IN OVERPOWERED CARD SHENANIGANS HOPEFULLY PHASE WILL BE AT LEAST THAT GOOD
I KNOW A GOOD DEAL OF PEOPLE AT MY FAGS WHO WILL EAT THIS UP I'M NOT PERSONALLY A FAN OF CCC TCG CG GAMES SO I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY SPECIAL EFFORT TO PICK IT UP

THAT SAID I WILL BE AT MY FAGS ON FRIDAY AND HE ALWAYS GETS A HUGE STACK OF THESE THINGS SO I COULD BE TEMPTED
I MIGHT GET IT WHEN IT DROPS TO LIKE ALL THE OTHER BLACK BOXES HAVE
WHY IS IT STILL CALLED THE BLACK BOX IF THEY'RE JUST TELLING PEOPLE WHAT'S IN IT ISN'T THAT JUST A REGULAR GAME NOW
I MOST LIKELY WILL I LOVE CCDS CGS CGS ETC SO THIS LOOKS AWESOME
IS THIS GOING TO BE THE SAME PRICE AS THE LAST FEW BLACKBOXES I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE GAME BEFORE BUYING IT
NOT REALLY MY TYPE OF GAME I WAS REALLY HOPING IT WOULD BE THEIR MYSTIC RPG I'VE HEARD OF THE ART DOES LOOK REALLY COOL AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHY EVERY UNIT HAS 2 POWERS

REGARDLESS WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF PURCHASING THIS AS A BLACK BOX INSTEAD OF AT RETAIL IS IT TYPICALLY CHEAPER ARE THERE SOME BONUSES
I LITERALLY SOLD EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF MTG MEMORABILIA I OWN YESTERDAY I THINK I'M JUST A LITTLE TOO AFRAID TO GET INTO THIS
COULD SOMEONE ELI AEC BLACKBOXES
AFTER BOOMTOWN I WILL NEVER BE BUYING ANOTHER AEC PRODUCT
THANKS FOR REPASTING SORRY AUTOMODERATOR WAS BEING WEIRD
IN MY OPINION IT IS MINDLESS RUNNING AND GUNNING

THE FACT THAT GETTING HIT IS MOSTLY A PLUS MAKES PEOPLE NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR OWN POSITIONING MUCH AND TRYING TO PREDICT WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE NEXT TURN IS A CRAPSHOOT SO WHAT REMAINS IS A GAME WHERE YOU DON'T PLAN AHEAD MUCH AND JUST QUICKLY GLANCE WHAT THE BEST SCORING OPTION IS ON YOUR TURN WHICH IS USUALLY WHERE YOU INFLICT MOST DAMAGE WHERE YOU COUNT FIRST AND LAST HITS ON PEOPLE A BIT MORE BUT THE MAJORITY SCORING ISN'T REALLY LOPSIDED TOWARDS FIRST SO GETTING A BUNCH OF SECOND AND THIRD PLACES INSTEAD OF FEWER FIRST PLACES ISN'T REALLY A BIG DEAL


AS SOMEONE WHO REALLY HATES AMERITRASH ESPECIALLY MINIATURES GAMES I'LL GIVE THIS ONE A SHOT BUT I DEFINITELY DO NOT THINK THIS IS A EURO IT'S DEFINITELY BUT THE STRATEGY IN THIS GAME IS STILL MOSTLY A CRAPSHOOT WITH MOSTLY REACTIONARY ACTIONS TO SCORE THE MOST POINTS
BEST OR NEWEST
WHEN EURO MEETS THEMATIC MECHANICS IT SEEMS TO BE A HUGE HIT TERRAFORMING MARS FITS THIS DESCRIPTION AS WELL DESIGNERS TAKE NOTICE
IT'S FOR A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT GROUP THAN REGULAR CODENAMES I THINK IN CODENAMES WE'D TRY TO FIND METAPHORS AND ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE MEANING OF THE WORDS SO IT'S GREAT FOR ABSTRACT THINKERS IN PICTURES OTOH MOST OF THE TIME THE CLUE GIVER WOULD JUST DESCRIBE WHICH VISUAL FEATURES THE CARDS HAD IN COMMON ALMOST FEELING LIKE A BEGINS WITH M CLUE THAT'S UNEXPRESSEDLY FORBIDDEN IN NORMAL CODENAMES MAYBE IT'S BETTER FOR VISUAL THINKERS OR PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO KEEP THEIR IDEAS DIRECT AND TANGIBLE I'LL STICK WITH WORDS
IT'S FINE IT'S BASICALLY EXACTLY THE SAME AS CODENAMES
I DIDN'T PLAY PICTURES PERSONALLY BUT I DEMODE IT QUITE A FEW TIME IN A GAMING PUB NOW THEY'RE MIGHT BE A LOT OF REASON BUT IT SEEMS GROUPS PLAY LONGER WITH THE ORIGINAL THAN WITH PICTURES

WHENEVER I TEACH THE ORIGINAL IF THE GROUP LIKES IT THEY PLAY CLOSE TO ONE HOUR CONVERSELY I'VE NEVER SEEN A TABLE PLAYING PICTURES FOR MORE THAN A FEW ROUNDS OF COURSE MAYBE THESE TABLES WOULDN'T PLAY WITH THE ORIGINAL MUCH EITHER

I'VE ALSO FOUND THAT IT'S DEFINITELY HARDER TO GRASP FOR THEY EASILY GET THE IDEA OF WORD ASSOCIATION BUT THE IDEA OF ASSOCIATION IS JUST ONE STEP ABOVE FOR SOME REASON

I LIKE THE UNIQUE SPY CARDBOARD CARDS THOUGH
YEAH IT'S FINE INITIAL PAYMASTER ANALYSIS PARALYSIS ON HOWF CAN I LINK THESE TOGETHER WAS QUITE EVIDENT BUT BECAME EASIER
THANKS FOR COMMENTATING EVERYBODY

KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR MORE POSTS LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE ITS GREAT TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THESE GAMES
ON THEIR WEBSITE I SAW THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN PREORDERED FROM THERE
YEAH CHECK THEIR WEBSITE I BELIEVE THEY ONLY JUST FINISHED SHIPPING TO KS BACKERS WITHIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS SO I WOULD EXPECT COPIES TO BE AVAILABLE IF YOU ASK THE RIGHT PERSON
IF YOU RESIDE IN WESTERN EUROPE YOU CAN BUY FROM PHILIBERT



THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS FANTASTIC THEY ARE FRENCH BASED BUT SHIP IN EUROPE AND HAVE A FAIRLY LARGE CHOICE OF GAMES IN ENGLISH VERSION
DANG THIS GAME LOOKS SWEET AND FLEW COMPLETELY UNDER MY RADAR GLAD I STUMBLED ACROSS THIS QUESTION
RATS DOESN'T GIVE THE OPTION FOR THE MINIS



WELL I HAVE NO CONNECTION TO NASON GAMES

I HAVE NO TROUBLE AT ALL BELIEVING THIS
YOU CAN ONLY POST A COMMENT IF YOU ARE A BACKER
THE BEST PLACE TO WATCH FOR THESE IS THE R BOARDGAMEDEALS SUBREDDIT
THE BEST PLACE TO LOOK IS THE BG HOT DEALS FORUM YOU WILL FIND THAT TO BE MOST UP TO DATE AND HAS LOTS OF DISCUSSION
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR MINIATUREMARKET IS STARTING THEIR THANKSGIVING WEEK SALE TODAY AND I BELIEVE ON WEDNESDAY CARDANUS IS DOING A FLAT OFF BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN ACTUAL CONFIRMATION ON THAT
I ONLY PLAYED LEGENDS OF ANDOR OUT OF THE BUNCH AND WHILE I ENJOY IT IT FEELS VERY DIFFERENT THAN A GAME LIKE DESCENT ANDOR IS A PROBLEM SOLVING GAME AT ITS CORE YOU REALLY HAVE TO ANALYZE THE PLACEMENT AND MOVEMENT OF THE MONSTERS AND CAREFULLY PLAN EACH TURN TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE SCENARIOS IT HAS MORE IN COMMON WITH A GAME LIKE PANDEMIC OR FORBIDDEN DESERT THAN DESCENT

WHILE YOU WILL FIGHT MONSTERS THE COMBAT MECHANICS ARE REALLY SIMPLE AND ARE NOT THE FOCUS OF THE GAME IF YOU WANT A GAME ABOUT EPIC MONSTER FIGHTS ANDOR WILL NOT SATISFY YOU
LEGENDS OF ANDOR IS MY NEW FAVORITE
THANK YOU
CATACOMBS AND DESCENT ARE VERY DIFFERENT GAMES

COMPARING THEM DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE IF YOU WANT A FUN DEXTERITY GAME THEN CATACOMBS IS BETTER IF YOU WANT A MORE SERIOUS DUNGEON CRAWLER DESCENT IS A BETTER GAME
CATACOMBS IF YOU ARE INTO TRYING A DEX GAME DESCENT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY LIKE A IND TYPE OF GAME ANDOR IF YOU WANT A COOP AS IN THE OTHER GAMES YOU NEED TO HAVE ONE PLAYER AGAINST THE REST

EDIT FIXED SO MANY TYPOS
THREE DIFFERENT GAMES WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MECHANISMS

I WOULD RANK THEM ACCORDINGLY

DESCENT

2 LEGENDS OF ANDOR

CATACOMBS
I ALMOST WONDERED WHY LAS VEGAS WAS ON THERE SINCE IT SEEMS LIKE IT ONLY GOES UP TO PLAYERS THEN I SEE THAT YOU MENTION AN EXPANSION THAT GOES TO PLAYERS COOL I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS AN EXPANSION FOR THIS GAME GOOD INFO
AWESOME ARTICLE ALSO I'M A SIMPLE MAN I SEE RUSSIAN RAILROADS FLARE I UNVOTE RUSSIAN RAILROADS FLARE
IN A SIMILAR VEIN TO SAY ANYTHING WIT'S AND WAGERS IS ANOTHER GREAT ONE
GREAT PICKS GREAT ARTICLE I HAVEN'T HEARD OF CONCEPTS
ANOTHER GOOD GAME FOR A BIG GROUP IS DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG GOES ALL THE WAY TO PLAYERS
I WOULD BARELY CONSIDER CODENAMES A GOOD BIG GROUP GAME ONCE YOU HIT PER TEAM IT STARTS TO BECOME TOO MUCH AND MAKES THE GAME DRAG IMO
CHECK OUT BONANZA PLAYS UP TO QUITE WELL EVERYONE IS INVOLVED ON EVERYONE TURNS SO DOWNTIME REALLY ISN'T AN ISSUE IT IS A GAME ABOUT GROWING AND TRADING BEANS MIGHT SOUND DULL BUT THE ARTWORK IS HUMOROUS AND THE TRADING NEGOTIATING IS A LOT OF FUN
TOUGH TO SAY WHAT YOUR FRIEND WILL FIND PRETTY SINCE ART IS SO SUBJECTIVE BUT MAYBE SOME OF THESE WILL SUFFICE

WONDERS CERTAINLY BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS BUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT CUTE
COLT EXPRESS THE ILLUSTRATIONS MIGHT WORK WITH THIS ONE
CAMEL UP SAME WITH THIS ONE
CELESTIA MORE GORGEOUS ILLUSTRATIONS
GHOSTS LOVE CANDY MIGHT BE A LITTLE SIMPLE FOR YOUR GROUP BUT THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE

WHAT ABOUT DIXIT RATHER THAN MYSTERIUM SOME OF THE CARDS AND THINGS PEOPLE COME UP WITH GET A TON OF LAUGHS AND THE GAME IS BASICALLY NOTHING BUT ARTICLE

AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CH WHAT ABOUT JOKING HAZARD IT MIGHT NOT BE BEAUTIFUL BUT THERE IS ART TO LOOK AT AT LEAST AND IT'S A LITTLE LESS VULGAR
IT IS JUST A SILLY CARD GAME BUT I REALLY LIKE ALL OF THE CARDS HAVE CUTE PICTURES OF CATS DOING SILLY THINGS
I FEEL THAT DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG DOES WHAT MYSTERIUM DOES BUT IN A FASTER MORE INTERESTING AND MORE INVOLVED WAY PLUS IT'S WAY EASIER TO TEACH THE NEGATIVE IS THAT THE ARTWORK IS A LOT LESS INTERESTING IT'S NOT POOR BUT SIMPLY FUNCTIONAL AND VERY TO THE POINT DECEPTION ALSO PLAYS AT LARGER PLAYER COUNTS

EDIT
GAMES WITH A LESS HEAVY THEME BUT THAT SHOULD FIT YOUR DESCRIPTION ARE DIXIT AN ASSOCIATIVE PICTURE GAME WITH AMAZING ART CODENAMES ASSOCIATIVE WORD PICTURE GAME THAT IS PLAYED IN TEAMS AND ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF A SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAME THAT PLAYS OUT IN TEN MINUTES FLAT THE LATTER TWO ARE WEAKER WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR ART BUT THEIR MECHANICS SHINE THROUGH
THE ARTWORK IS DEFINITELY BUT I'VE REALLY ENJOYED SNAKE OIL IN LARGER GROUPS
SUPER DUNGEON EXPLORE FORGOTTEN KING MAYBE YOU CAN PLAY V ALL OR A FULL CO-OP MODE
KITTENS IN A BLENDER IS ONE FILLER LEVEL GAME I DO STILL REALLY ENJOY EVERYONE IS OUT TO SAVE KITTENS OF THEIR CHOSEN COLOR WHILE TURNING THEIR OPPONENTS KITTENS INTO CAT SMOOTHIES THE ART IN THIS GAME IS JUST ADORABLE AND IT PRETTY INEXPENSIVE YOU NEED THE EXPANSION TO PLAY BUT THE BONUS IS THAT IT ALSO ADDS A LITTLE MORE COMPLEXITY TO THE GAME

NEVERMORE IS A VERY INTERACTIVE DRAFTING GAME WITH A VERY TAKE THAT NATURE TO IT YOU ARE TRYING TO COLLECT VICTORY POINTS WHILE ALSO TRYING TO TURN OTHER PLAYERS INTO RAVENS TO TRY AND SLOW DOWN THEIR CHANCES OF WINNING THE ART IS VERY APPEALING AND IS ONE OF THE REASONS I PICKED UP THE GAME

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM SAYS ON THE BOX BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH CARDS IN THE GAME THAT IT CAN EASILY BE PLAYED WITH IF YOU ADD ANOTHER BAG COULD JUST BE AN ENVELOPE REALLY IT'S A PRETTY FUN BLUFFING GAME THAT CAN EASILY GET QUITE SILLY

ZOMBICIDE IS A LONG TIME CO-OP FAVORITE OF MINE IT IS ON THE PRICEY SIDE THOUGH SO LOOK UP SOME VIDEOS FOR IT AND SEE IF YOUR FRIENDS HAVE INTEREST COMES IN A MODERN AND FANTASY SETTING BLACK PLAGUE EITHER IS FINE THOUGH BLACK PLAGUE HAS THE MOST POLISHED RULE SET
JAMAICA LIGHT GAME WITH NICE CUTE PIRATE ARTICLE
ABOVE AND BELOW THIS ONLY PLAYS BUT RYAN GAMES HAVE REALLY NICE ARTICLE MAYBE CONSIDER SPLITTING INTO 2 GROUPS OF SOMETIMES


DUNGEON PETZ DEFINITELY IT'S A BIT COMPLICATED TO START BUT BY TURN 2 IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD HAS ADORABLE ART AND SILLY MECHANISMS

EDIT I REMEMBERED IT BEING MORE PLAYERS BUT ISN'T TOO BAD
COSMIC ENCOUNTER A FAST PACED GAME OF NEGOTIATION AND BLUFFING WITH FANTASTIC ARTICLE THE BEST PART OF THE GAME ARE THE SPECIAL PLAYER POWERS THAT ARE HILARIOUS AND ALTER THE GAME IN FUNNY WAYS FOR EXAMPLE THE FIDO RACE HAS THE POWER TO FETCH IT PLAYS WITH EXPANSIONS

COSMICENCOUNTER IMAGES A AB FIDO FFA APG REVISION LATEST CB

KEYFLOWER A EUROGAME THAT IS A MIX OF BIDDING AND WORKER PLACEMENT IT PLAYS WELL WITH PLAYERS

DIXIT IT'S A COMPETITIVE GAME THAT IS SIMILAR TO MYSTERIUM

WALK THE PLANK A SILLY SIMULTANEOUS ACTION GAME ABOUT TRYING TO DROWN YOUR OPPONENT'S PIRATES RULES ARE SIMPLE AND YOU CAN PLAY A GAME IN MINUTES OR LESS
SIX IS HARD SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE AREN'T THAT MANY SIX PLAYER GAMES OUT THERE INCLUDING FUNNY AND THAT PUTS THEM MORE IN THE PARTY GAME TERRITORY WHICH LIMITS THE IDEA OF BEAUTIFUL

CODENAMES PICTURES MIGHT BE A GOOD OPTION

ISTANBUL IS BEAUTIFUL AND A TON OF FUN BUT IT ONLY GOES UP TO FIVE IT'S A FUN GAME WHERE YOU ARE PLAYING AS MERCHANTS TRAVELING THE MARKETS OF ISTANBUL TRADING RESOURCES AND MONEY FOR RUBIES FIRST TO FIVE OR SIX RUBIES WINS THE GAME

YOU COULD TRY ALTERNATIVES TO CH LIKE UNEMPLOYED OR JOKING HAZARD

THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT BETRAYER GAMES THAT YOU COULD CHECK OUT ALTHOUGH THEY GENERALLY AREN'T HA-HA FUNNY AND NOT ALL OF THEM GO UP TO SIX FOR EXAMPLE DEAD OF WINTER SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT AND BATTLESTEAD GALACTIA BG IS THE LONGEST OF THE THREE AND I ONLY SUGGEST THE GAME IF PEOPLE IN YOUR GROUP HAS WATCHED THE SHOW AS THE BOARD IS RATHER PLAIN

DRAFTING GAMES CAN ALSO SCALE WELL BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE SAID I'D SUGGEST MEDIEVAL ACADEMY IT'S MEDIEVAL THEMED WITH NICE ALBEIT CARTOON ARTWORK ON EACH TILE

U GETINFO
IF YOU'RE ALREADY COMFORTABLE WITH SOMETHING LIKE LORDS OF WATERDEEP I'M GOING TO SUGGEST VITICULTURE ESSENTIAL EDITION IT'S NOT MUCH OF A STEP UP AND HAS A GREAT THEME MAKING WINE I PERSONALLY THINK THE ART IS WELL DONE AND THERE'S A TOUCH OF HUMOR THERE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A CARD CALLED UNLICENSED TEACHER THAT YOU CAN PLAY TO TRAIN AN ADDITIONAL WORKER AT THE COST OF ONE VICTORY POINT INSTEAD OF PAYING THE NORMAL MONETARY COST SO THAT'S KINDA CUTE

I ALSO THINK MYSTERIUM OR DIXIT ARE SOLID CHOICES FOR GREAT ART AND HIGH PLAYER COUNT
IF YOU GET THE STANDARD DECK OF EXPLODING KITTENS YOU CAN ADD IT TO THE NSF DECK AND PLAY WITH UP TO PEOPLE IT'S AN OK GAME CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE THE FOCUS OF THE EVENING BUT IT'LL HIT THE TABLE MORE OFTEN
ALSO CAPTAIN SONAR MAY BE A GOOD FIT
COLT EXPRESS

A FEW OTHERS MENTIONED IT BUT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN

PRETTY

THE 3D TRAIN SCENERY CATCHES PEOPLES ATTENTION

CARD ART IS VERY COOL COMIC BOOK VIBE

FUNNY

HOLY CRAP THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE GETS PUNCHED INTO THE NEXT CAR AND THEN THEIR WHOLE TURN IS GONE TO CRAP WELL IT SURE IS FUNNY FOR EVERYONE ELSE

COLT EXPRESS IS A PROGRAMMABLE DECK BUILDER KINDA WHERE PLAYERS ARE BANDITS ROBBING A TRAIN AND TRYING TO MAKE OUT WITH THE MOST LOOT AT THE END OF THE GAME IT'S PURE CHAOS AT MAX PLAYER CT AND A LOT OF FUN HIGHLY RECOMMEND
CODENAMES IS A BLAST AT PLAYERS PROBABLY IT'S BEST PLAYER COUNT

KEYFLOWER IS QUITE FUN NICE TO LOOK AT AND SCALES REALLY WELL FROM 2 PLAYERS RIGHT UP TO PLAYERS

ALSO EVERY GAME MADE BY STONEMAIER GAMES FITS THIS BILL VITICULTURE ESSENTIAL EDITION IS LOVELY TO LOOK AT AND A FUN GAME IT GOES UP TO AND STILL PLAYS WELL AT THAT COUNT EUPHORIA IS A DYSTOPIAN FUTURE GAME WITH GREAT ART CLEVER SUBTLE HUMOUR AND PLAYS GREAT FROM PLAYERS BETWEEN TWO CITIES IS A TILE DRAFTING GAME WHERE PLAYERS ARE BUILDING TWO CITIES ONE WITH EACH OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS YOUR SCORE IS THE LOWEST SCORING OF THE TWO SO THERE'S AN INCENTIVE TO KEEP THINGS BALANCED SCYTHE IS FINALLY AVAILABLE AT RETAIL AND ONE OF THE MOST GORGEOUS GAMES I'VE SEEN THE BASE GAME GOES UP TO PLAYERS BUT IT'S GETTING AN EXPANSION THIS MONTH THAT ALLOWS UP TO PLAYERS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES OF THE YEAR
I NORMALLY DON'T SELECT GAMES BASED ON ARTWORK HUMOUR BUT LET'S GIVE THIS A GO

FOR SIX PLAYERS I LIKE

BONANZA PLAYS UP TO AND IS PRIMARILY A TRADING GAME THE GAME IS STRUCTURED SO YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO TRADE NICELY IF YOU WANT TO DO WELL THE ARTWORK IS CUTESY AND YOU CAN TRADE STINK BEANS FOR BLACK EYED BEANS WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT

ROBORALLY THE LITTLE ROBOT MINIS ARE ADORES AND THERE'S BRIGHT VIBRANT COLOURS ALL OVER THE BOARD WHICH MASKS THE DESPAIR AND DANGER SIX IS A FUN NUMBER TO PLAY THIS AT BECAUSE YOU GET IN EACH WAY ALL THE DAMN TIME IT'S A BIT CHINKY WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PROGRAM THE ROBOTS BUT THE LAUGHTER AND SHRIEKS OF HORROR WHEN THINGS INEVITABLY GO WRONG IS A LOT OF FUN

FOR SALE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FILLERS IT'S BASICALLY AN AUCTIONING GAME WHERE YOU BUY UP PROPERTIES AND THEN SELL THEM TO GET THE MOST MONEY THE ARTWORK IS GREAT FOR THE PROPERTIES THEY ARE RANKED FROM A HUMBLE CARDBOARD BOX IN AN ALLEY TO A GIGANTIC SPACE STATION AND IT'S DONE VERY QUICKLY

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF I THINK THIS PLAYS REALLY WELL WITH UNLIKE MANY OTHER HIDDEN IDENTITY SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES LIKE THE RESISTANCE OR REGULAR WEREWOLF I LOVE THE ARTWORK AND IT'S A LOT OF FUN ONCE THE GROUP GETS IT

COLT EXPRESS LOOKS GREAT ON THE TABLE AND THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAMMING ENSURES A GOOD AMOUNT OF CONFLICT

CAMEL UP A GAME WITH RACING CAMELS WITH LOVELY ARTWORK AND CUTE CAMEL MEEDLESS THAT STACK ON TOP OF EACH OTHER FOR REASONS THAT ARE SURPRISINGLY DESPITE APPEARANCES THIS IS ACTUALLY MORE OF A BETTING GAME THAN A RACING GAME

DIAMANT INCAN GOLD GREAT PUSH YOUR LUCK GAME THAT USUALLY RESULTS IN A LOT OF AUGHTS DIAMANT HAS THE NICER ARTWORK SO MIGHT BE THE PREFERRED VERSION

STEAMPUNK RALLY RACING GAME WITH BEAUTIFUL ARTWORK MOST ACTIONS ARE MORE OR LESS SIMULTANEOUS SO THERE'S LITTLE DOWNTIME

COCKROACH POKER BLUFFING CARD GAME LOVELY CARDS WITH DRAWINGS OF VARIOUS BUGS ON THEM AND EACH CARD HAS UNIQUE ARTWORK WHICH IS REALLY NICE

GHOST BLITZ GRABBIEST GAME EVER THIS IS A SPEED GAME WHERE A CARD IS FLIPPED AND YOU HAVE TO GRAB THE CORRECT OBJECT A WHITE GHOST A RED CHAIR A BLUE BOOK A GREEN BOTTLE OR A GREY MOUSE FIRST

PICTOMANIA ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES IT'S BY VLADA CHVATIL AND I DESCRIBE IT AS BEING LIKE DICTIONARY IF DICTIONARY WERE A GOOD GAME THE ARTWORK AND HUMOUR ARE REALLY ALL UP TO THE PLAYERS

DITTO TELESTRATIONS

GOOD LUCK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY FUNNY ACTUALLY KINDA THE OPPOSITE IF YOU READ THE BACKSTORY IN THE MANUAL BUT REX WAS MADE TO BE PLAYED PLAYER AND HAS A PRETTY GREAT SCIFI AESTHETIC

ALSO TO COSMIC ENCOUNTER TECHNICALLY YOU COULD EVEN RIG A SIXTH PLAYER WITH LIKE PENNIES AND COASTERS AND USE THE SPECIAL DESTINIES AS THEIR COLOR BUT IF AESTHETICS IS A CONCERN THAT'S OBVIOUSLY LESS THAN IDEAL PLUS COSMIC INCURSION IS WORTH PICKING FOR THE REWARDS DECK ALONE ANYWAY ALSO IF YOU REALLY WANNA GO FOR IT I RECOMMEND GRABBING LIKE A PIECE OF SPACEY FABRIC FROM WHEREVER TO USE AS A PLAYMAN
THINK YOU SHOULD STILL GIVE HAPPY PIGS A SHOT IT'S RELATIVELY CHEAP AND CAN HAVE SOME BIG FUNNY MOMENTS
SOMETHING THAT FITS THE BILL IS COSMIC ENCOUNTER WITH ANY EXPANSION THAT GIVES YOU A SIXTH PLAYER

DO YOU NEED THE GAME TO HAVE HUMOUR OR COULD IT JUST HAVE GREAT ARTWORK
YOU CAN PLAY EXPLODING KITTENS WITH PLAYERS JUST PUT THE FIRST EXPLODING KITTEN BACK IN THE DECK WHEN THE FIRST PERSON IS ELIMINATED
IF YOUR FRIEND IS SO PICKY SHE CAN ONLY PLAY GAMES THAT ARE FUNNY AND CUTE THE REST OF YOU SHOULD PLAY OTHER GAMES WITHOUT HERALDRY YOU AREN'T BEING PAID TO ENTERTAIN HERALDRY
FOR SOMETHING MORE MEATY GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME
YOU'RE ELIMINATING PROBABLY OF THE GAMES THAT COULD WORK BY LIMITING YOURSELF TO PLAYER GAMES TWO PLAYER GAMES WOULD GIVE YOU LOTS AND LOTS MORE OPTIONS
I'D LOOK INTO SPYFAULT IF I WERE YOU
HERE ARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS

CASH N GUNS

THIS IS A SUPER FUN GAME WHERE YOU GET TO AIM GUNS AT EACH OTHER OME BUT THERE IS ALSO ART THAT'S KINDA CUTE AND PRETTY AND IT'S A VERY SIMPLE GAME PLAYERS MIGHT BE A GAME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR



THIS MAY BE AN OPTION IF YOU'RE TRULY LOOKING FOR A GAME STRONGLY BASED ON ARTICLE YOU BUILD YOUR OWN COMIC STRIP THE VOTING SYSTEM IS VERY FAIR IN THIS GAME AS WELL IMO THE ONLY FLAW TO THIS GAME THAT WE'VE RUN INTO PERSONALLY IS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT SOMEONE CREATIVE OR ALWAYS HAS WRITER BLOCK IT MAY NOT BE AS FUN FOR MOST PLAYERS LOTS OF ART TO LOOK AT CAN ALWAYS CREATE FUNNY STORIES

HOAX

THIS ONE MAY BE AN OPTION THE EDITION I HAVE IS PLAYERS THE ART ISN'T AMAZING NOT TOO MANY COMPONENTS WHEN WE PLAYED IT WAS FUNNY THE ONLY ISSUE WITH THIS GAME THAT I HAD IS ONCE YOU FIGURE OUT THE STRATEGY THE GAME ISN'T REALLY HARD BUT A RUSH TO SEE WHO CAN USE THE TACTIC FASTER BETTER

MONSTER MY NEIGHBOUR

THIS IS A GAME SIMILAR TO ULTIMATE WEREWOLF MAFIA ETC THE ART ISN'T MY FAVORITE BUT IT PLAYS MUCH MORE LIKE A CARD GAME NO MODERATOR NEEDED LOOKS LIKE BG STATES IT'S FOR PLAYERS ART IS MPH IMO BUT YOUR FRIEND MAY LIKE IT

SUPERTIGHT

PLAYERS NO ARTICLE BUT SIMILAR TO CH INSTEAD OF GROSS HUMOR WELL YOU PICK WHICH HERO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT NEO OR JESUS CHUCK NORRIS OR GODZILLA DEBATE ABOUT IT ADD OTHER CARDS TO MAKE THEM WEAKER OR STRONGER THERE'S ALSO EXPANSIONS LIKE THE RED DECK TO MAKE THINGS RAUNCHY

HOPE THIS HELPS GOOD LUCK
TAKE A LOOK AT LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL ITS A GREAT GAME
EPIC SPELL WARS HAS AWESOME ART AND CAN BE PRETTY FUNNY IT'S COMPLETELY LUCK BASED THOUGH AND THERE ISN'T MUCH STRATEGY
NOBODY MENTIONED CAVERN THE FIRST COUPLE OF GAMES MIGHT GO LONG BUT ONCE EVERYONE KNOWS THE RULES IT'LL PLAY AT A NICE PACE BEAUTIFUL AND PLAYFUL ARTWORK YET IT IS A DEEP AND CHALLENGING GAME AND YOU GET TO GROW A FARM AND DECORATE YOUR CAVE
I'M GOING TO PUT IT OUT THERE AND SUGGEST BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA IT'S UP TO SIX PLAYERS AND HAS A TRAITOR ELEMENT TO IT THE VANILLA GAME IS FUN AND THE EXPANSIONS ADD A WEALTH OF OPTIONS
PROCEDURALLY GENERATED

MAN THAT BRINGS FLASHBACKS
LOVE THIS IDEA HOW DO THE SECRET IDENTITIES END UP FEELING SINCE THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT EACH TIME YOU PLAY ARE PLAYERS ABLE TO GUESS WHAT THE OTHER PLAYERS IDENTITIES MIGHT BE OR DOES IT END UP FEELING A BIT MORE RANDOM WHEN THEY'RE REVEALED AT THE END OF THE GAME
SEEMS COOL IN THEORY BUT I JUST SPUN UP A GAME AND THE CHARACTERS ARE PRETTY DUMB ONE OF THE GUYS HAS 2 FOR METEOROLOGY ORDERS FOR METEOROLOGY ORDERS AND FOR NO METEOROLOGY ORDERS SO HE'S AT A DISTINCT DISADVANTAGE OVER EVERYONE ELSE BECAUSE HE CAN ONLY SCORE POINTS MAX FROM HIS CHARACTER SINCE 2 OF THOSE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IT LOOKS THE OTHERS ALL HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCORE POINTS AND ONE OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS IS FOR NOT HAVING BUDGET DOCUMENTS AND FOR NOT HAVING BUDGET DOCUMENTS MEANING HE HAS ONE THING TO DO TO GET EXTRA POINTS BALANCE IN A PROCEDURALLY GENERATED GAME IS INHERENTLY HARDER TO ACHIEVE UNLESS YOU PUT A LOT OF CONDITIONS ON THE CHARACTER GENERATION
BROKEN WITH BOTH EDGE AND IE CURRENT
AFTER NO MAN'S SKY I AM OVER THE NOTION OF PROCEDURALLY GENERATED ANYTHING
ABANDON PLANET FROM DON ESKRIDGE LOOKS PRETTY GREAT I HOPE IT DOES WELL I'M ON THE FENCE PERSONALLY I'D JUMP ON IT IF IT WASN'T SEASON AND IF I HAD A MORE RELIABLE LARGE PLAYGROUND
DIDN'T REALIZE THE UNWITCH HORROR AHLCG EXPANSION CAME WITH THE FIRST AND LAST SCENARIOS THOUGHT IT WAS THE FIRST TWO THAT'S A LET DOWN
I'VE BEEN DELVING INTO TTRPGS LATELY DUE IN SMALL PART TO A SKUAS REVIEW OF TORCHBEARER BUT BOTH OF THOSE NETRUNNER AND MARKHAM HORROR PRESS RELEASES ARE GOING TO BRING ME BACK TO BOARD GAMES SOON ENOUGH
I'M MILDLY INTERESTED IN LISBOA BUT WITH SHIPPING BRINING THE PRICE OVER FOR ME I'M JUST NOT SURE IT'LL HIT THE TABLE ENOUGH OH WELL
PATHFINDER ADVENTURE CARD GAME HAS A DIGITAL VERSION WHICH IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL GAME

IF YOU LIKE PATHFINDER ACS IT IS REALLY CONVENIENT AS THERE ARE A LOT OF SHUFFLE IN GAME THAT THE APP GET RID OF
SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE IS AN ACS OF SORTS NO DIGITAL VERSION
MARKHAM HORROR ADVENTURE CARD GAME JUST RELEASED FROM FFA AGAIN NO DIGITAL VERSION YET
CHECK OUT IT'S AN INTRIGUING SPIN ON D D WITH ELEMENTS
MISTFALL AS A DIGITAL VERSION ON TABLETOP SIMULATOR
WERE THEY PLAYING A ROLE-PLAYING GAME IF SO I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HARMONQUEST SEES HAS RELEASED THE FIRST EPISODE HERE
THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME TO GET SPACE HULK UNTIL THE NEXT TIME WHICH WILL BE THE ONLY TIME TO GET IT BEFORE IT GOES AWAY FOREVER UNTIL THE NEXT TIME

THIS IS A SUPER GOOD GAME IF YOU'RE INTERESTED YOU SHOULD SNAG IT NOT BECAUSE GW KEEPS SAYING IT WILL NEVER COME BACK BUT BECAUSE IT'S GOOD
I'LL GET EXCITED IF THEY DEATHLING OR GENESTEALER
IF ANYONE IS LOOKING FOR A COPY NOW MINIATURE MARKET HAS AN COPY AT THEIR RETAIL STORE AT A DISCOUNT
VERIFIED THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO RULES ETC

I GUESS I'LL FINALLY GIVE IN AND BUY IT LOL
WONDER WHAT IT WILL COST HERE IN NZ YOU KNOW OCEANIA TAX AND ALL THAT ASIDE THIS IS ONE GAME OF THEIRS I DO WANT I DONT SEE IT ON GW ONLINE STORE YET
WITH RESPECT TO THE AMAZING FIGURES IN THE GAME THE MECHANICS ARE VERY DATED ROLLING A CRITICAL JAM CAN EASILY COST YOU THE ENTIRE MISSION
FORBIDDEN ISLAND IS AN EXCELLENT COOPERATIVE GAME WITH A THEME THAT MOST ANYONE CAN PICK UP TREASURE HUNTERS ON AN ISLAND SINKING INTO THE SEA IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE FOR VERY CHEAP RECENT SALES ON AMAZON HAVE HAD IT UNDER TEN DOLLARS AND THE REGULAR LSRP IS ONLY FIFTEEN OR SO PLAYS UP TO FOUR COMES IN A COOL TIN
OVER YEARS OLD ASSUMING THEY AREN'T BEHIND IN THEIR READING ABILITY IT IS AS MUCH A MATTER OF PERSONAL PREFERENCE AS ANY ADULT IF I COULD QUOTE PAGE AND SUBSECTION OF THE DCI RULEBOOK FOR MAGIC THE GATHERING AT I'M PRETTY SURE YEAR OLDS CAN HANDLE BOARD GAMES

SO THAT SAID GET THEM THE HITS THE ONES MOST PEOPLE LIKE THAT WOULD BE YOUR PANDEMIC CATAN TELESTRATIONS CODENAMES FLASK KING OF TOKYO PASS THE PIGS SPYFAULT BONANZA WONDERS BLOCKUS THINGS YOU CAN FIND AT TARGET
I WOULD RECOMMEND LIGHT GAMES YOU NEVER KNOW IF ANY OF THEM HAVE ANY SORT OF LEARNING PROBLEM OR DISORDER MY NEPHEW IS IN THAT AGE RANGE AND HAS ASPERGER HE CAN PLAY ALL OF THE LIGHT GAMES NO PROBLEM BUT SOME OF THE MEDIUM WEIGHT GAMES DON'T HOLD HIS ATTENTION WELL SUSHI GO LOVE LETTER SURVIVE CODENAMES TIMELINE ETC ALL WORK REALLY WELL ANYTHING HEAVIER THAN THAT AND I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE RULES SEVERAL TIMES AS WE PLAY OR HELP HIM JUST ONE THING TO CONSIDER
NO THANKS

DIAMANT

LORDS OF VEGAS

DEEP SEA ADVENTURE

A FAKE ARTIST GOES TO NEW YORK

I'D SEE THE CHALLENGE HERE BEING THE THEME YOU WANT TO AVOID POTENTIAL TRIGGER GAMES
SAW SOME KIDS THAT AGE HAVING A BLAST WITH THE NEW MACHS VS MINIONS WHICH THEY ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH FROM LEAGUE OF LEGENDS GREAT AS ITS COOPERATIVE THEY ALSO ENJOYED IMPERIAL ASSAULT WHICH IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX AND NEEDS A CONSISTENT GROUP BUT IS GREAT IF THEY ARE STAR WARS FANS
THE REPLACEABILITY OF GAMES LIKE THIS COMES FROM THE FACT IT'S HARD TO BEAT TOO EASY AND TIPS PROBABLY LOSE INTEREST

THERE ARE SOME ANNOYING WAYS TO LOSE I'D SAY IF THE CARDS COME OUT IN A CERTAIN ORDER YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE A VERY HARD TIME WINNING AND THAT CAN BE FRUSTRATING IT IS POSSIBLE IN ANY GAME I THINK ESPECIALLY DECKBUILDERS TO MAKE NO WRONG DECISIONS AND STILL LOSE

FROM A GAMEPLAY POINT OF VIEW ARE YOU BUYING ENOUGH COORDINATE CARDS THE MORE YOU COORDINATE THE BETTER YOUR CHANCE OF WINNING

ALSO HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU PLAY WITH I ONLY BEAT IT AT PLAYER COUNT OF ALSO UNLESS YOU'VE HAD A FEW PLAYS AND KNOW THE CARDS A BIT YOU SIMPLY WON'T WIN

THE EASIEST WAY TO TEAK IS TO ADD MORE DRONE CARDS OR HAVE SOME TURNS AT THE START BEFORE YOU START FILLING THE COMPLEX I'D SAY DO BOTH AND TRY AND WIN THEN ONLY HAVE THE PREP TURNS AND TRY AND WIN THEN TRY IT WITH NEITHER MAKE A SORT OF EASY NORMAL AND HARD MODE
THE GAME IS HARD AND SOMETIMES THE RANDOMNESS OF CARDS CAN SCREW YOU OVER HOWEVER AN EXPERIENCED GROUP OF PLAYERS WILL DO BETTER OVERALL

COORDINATE CARDS ARE SUPER IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO DOING WELL GET AS MANY AS YOU CAN SPREAD AMONG EVERYONE'S DECKS AND UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED WHATEVER A COORDINATE CARD WILL GIVE YOU ON YOUR TURN YOU SHOULD BE USING IT TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE AFFORD A GOOD CARD DO MORE ATTACK POWER OR TRIGGER SYMBOL RELATED POWERS BEYOND THAT IT IS A MATTER OF BUILDING A GOOD DECK AND THAT TAKES SOME PRACTICE WITH THE GAME

I HAVE BEATEN SCENARIO 2 SO FAR DEFEATING REMAINS ELUSIVE FOR SCENARIOS 2 I HAVE HAD PLAYER GAMES SUCCEED WITHOUT DOING ANY PREP ROUNDS IN THAT SCENARIO GAME WE EVEN HAD THE PERFECT ORGANISM IN THE COMBAT ZONE FOR 2 OR FULL ROUNDS AROUND THE TABLE BEFORE WE FOUND THE AIRLOCK CARD IT WAS THE SECOND TO LAST CARD IN THE DECK LIKE MOST VERY HARD THAT DEPEND ON SOME KIND OF RANDOMIZED ELEMENT PART OF GETTING GOOD AT THE GAME IS LEARNING HOW TO PREPARE FOR AND COMBAT AGAINST THE RANDOMNESS

ANYWAY IF YOU WANT TO TRY REDUCING THE DIFFICULTY A LITTLE BIT YOU CAN DO ONE OR TWO PREP ROUNDS WHERE YOU DO NOT ADD ANYTHING TO THE COMPLEX AT THE VERY LEAST IT TENDS TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL MORE PREPARED BEFORE THINGS START TO GET DICEY
I HAVE BEAT ALL THE SCENARIOS WITH 2 AND PLAYERS THE GAME IS EASIEST AT THESE NUMBERS IT IS RECOMMENDED BY SOME ON HERE THAT YOU GO SO FAR AS TO SKIP ADDING ALIENS FOR A FEW ROUND WHEN PLAYING WITH OR PLAYERS AS THE JUMP IN DIFFICULTY IS SIGNIFICANT DRONE CARDS DEFINITELY MAKE THINGS SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER WE TRIED PLAYING THE FIRST SCENARIO WITH 2 PLAYERS AND DRONES AND HAVE YET TO BEAT IT DESPITE TWEAKING OUR CHARACTER SETUP OVER AND OVER AGAIN

I SUSPECT YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVEN'T PLAYED IT ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE SKILLS THAT MINIMISE THE LUCK OF THE GAME THE ROLES YOU PICK ARE A BIG DEAL TOO HOW YOU HANDLE SCANNING MATTERS SIGNIFICANTLY AND JUST KNOWING THE SCENARIO IN GENERAL SOME SCENARIOS YOU CAN GO FOR SARGENTS EARLY SOME YOU CAN'T SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T LIKE CO-OP GAMES SOME PLAYERS JUST DON'T LIKE TO LOSE AS A TEAM THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT YOU'LL HEAR PLAYING FOR NOT LAST PLACE A LOT OF TIMES BASICALLY YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE SO EXERCISE CAUTION WITH TWEAKING THE GAME TOO MUCH TO AID IN THE ENJOYMENT OF A SINGLE PERSON
I HAVE PLAYED ONLY AT PLAYERS BUT HAVE WON EVERY SCENARIO ONE OF THE BIGGEST KEYS TO WINNING IS GETTING AND USING THE COORDINATE CARDS YOU CAN PLAY THAT COORDINATE CARD OFF OF YOUR TURN AND THEN REDRAW A CARD TO REPLACE IT LIMIT ONE COORDINATE PER PERSON PER TURN THIS HELPS YOU MOVE THROUGH YOUR DECK FASTER I DON'T THINK PICKING ONE TYPE OF CHARACTER IS HELPFUL BUT MATCHING THE SYMBOLS TO SET OFF COMBOS IS BEST THE QUARANTINE SPECIALIST IS HELPFUL TO KILL OFF RECRUITMENT PEOPLE NEAR THE END OF THE GAME BUT HONESTLY IT ISN'T AS GREAT AS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE IDENTITIES OF THE MERCENARY AND COMBAT PERSON DRAW A CARD AND ATTACK IS EQUAL TO OBJECTIVE ARE AWESOME IN THE FIRST SCENARIO REMEMBER TO ADD DRONE CARDS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS PER OBJECTIVE
THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE IS MAKE SURE ALL THE SYMBOLS OF ONE TYPE GO TO ONE CHARACTER WHEN I PLAY WE HAVE ONE MEDIC ONE TACTICS ETC IF YOU SET UP YOUR DECK SO EVERY TIME YOU DRAW A PURCHASED CARD IT TRIGGERS YOU'VE GONE A LONG WAY TO BEATING THE SCENARIOS WE'VE ACTUALLY TRIVIALIZED SOME OF THE SCENARIOS BECAUSE ONE PERSON GOT A DRAW AND FIGHT DECK AND EVERY TIME HIS TURN CAME UP HE'D WIPE OUT THE COMPLEX

THE OTHER PIECE OF ADVICE I HAVE IS DON'T TREAT THE GAME LIKE A STORY THAT CAN BE SPOILED IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING YOU WILL LOSE AND THEN YOU'LL PLAY IT AGAIN AND YOU'LL DO BETTER ALL YOU'RE DOING IS SETTING YOURSELF UP TO LOSE THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES YOU PLAY IN THE FIRST SCENARIO FOR EXAMPLE KNOWING THERE'S ABOUT FACE HUGGERS IN THE FIRST PART OF THE DECK MEANS YOU ALL KNOW DON'T SCAN UNLESS YOU OR THE NEXT PERSON HAS FIGHT AFTER THE SCAN IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE DECK THEN YOU WILL LOSE TO DUMB LUCK IF YOU KNOW IT'S THERE YOU WILL PLAN AND THE LUCKY ASPECT OF THE GAME IS MINIMIZED BY PLANNING
THERE'S A BIT OF A MINDSET SHIFT SURE

IN THE RESISTANCE YOU KNOW WHAT TEAM YOU'RE IN AND YOU WANT THAT TEAM TO WIN IN ONUS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY IS TO FIND OUT WHAT TEAM YOU'RE ON AND THEN TO HELP THAT TEAM TO WIN

IN RESISTANCE THERE'S REALLY NO INCENTIVE FOR THE RESISTANCE TO LIE YOU JUST STRAIGHT UP SAY YOU'RE A GOOD GUY AND TRY TO WORK OUT WHO THE BAD GUYS ARE BASED ON THE INFORMATION YOU CAN GET VIA VOTING PATTERNS MISSION FAILS ETC

IN ONUS I WILL USUALLY START WITH SOME SORT OF LIE OMISSION OR HALF-TRUTH EVEN IF I KNOW I STARTED ON THE VILLAGERS TEAM ESPECIALLY IF I WAS A REGULAR VANILLA VILLAGER IF I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIAL ABILITIES LYING IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN RELIABLY GET INFORMATION PROACTIVELY AS OPPOSED TO JUST BEING QUIET AND LISTENING IT'S NOT SO BAD TO BE CAUGHT OUT LYING IN ONUS IF SOMEONE CALLS YOU OUT ON YOUR CLAIM TO BE THE SEER IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY ARE THE SEER IF NO ONE CALLS YOU OUT ON IT YOU CAN DEDUCE THAT THE SEER IS ACTUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OR THEY ARE WORRIED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SWAPPED WITH A WEREWOLF

GIVING A HALF-TRUTH CAN RESULT IN GOOD INFORMATION TOO SAYING THAT YOU'RE THE TROUBLEMAKER AND SWAPPED PLAYER C AND D WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SWAPPED PLAYER A AND B CAN TEASE OUT SOMETHING INTERESTING FOR EXAMPLE

THE GAME REVOLVES AROUND THE POSSIBILITY THAT YOU HAVE SWAPPED TEAMS SO I BELIEVE YOU NEED AT LEAST ONE OF THE TILE SWAPPING ROLES TROUBLEMAKER THIEF DRUNK IN THE MIX FOR A GOOD GAME OTHERWISE IT JUST TURNS INTO A STRAIGHTFORWARD DEDUCTION GAME WHERE EVERYONE TELLS THE TRUTH AND YOU CAN WORK OUT WHO THE WEREWOLVES ARE THEY WILL BE THE ONES CLAIMING VILLAGER EVERY TIME
HI I CAN HELP

I AM IN THE SAME BOAT NEW TO BOARDGAMES BEEN PLAYING A LOT OF THE PARTY ONES RECENTLY

HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PLAY
BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GAMES

IN AVALON UNLESS YOU PLAY WITH LANCELETS YOUR LOYALTY CAN NEVER CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE GAME AND YOU'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR TEAM WIN IN ONUS YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT YOUR ALLEGIANCE PLUS WHO TO TRY TO KILL SO EVERY PLAYER HAS SOME REASON TO LIE OR BE CAREFUL ABOUT SHARING THE WHOLE TRUTH AS YOU CAN QUICKLY LOSE A GAME BY PUTTING OUT TOO MUCH INFORMATION

AVALON IS FIRMLY STRUCTURED WHERE YOU ARE PROPOSING MISSIONS VOTING AND THEN INTERPRETING THE RESULTS IN ONUS THERE IS NO STRUCTURE AFTER YOU GO INTO THE DAY PHASE SO PREPARE PEOPLE WITH THE FACT THAT YOU NEED TO BE WILLING TO TALK OR CREATE THAT STRUCTURE PEOPLE NEED TO BE PREPARED TO HAVE CONVERSATION AND TRY TO WORK THROUGH IT
TEACHING
I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT YOU STATE THAT THEY WILL NOT GRASP THE GAME FOR AT LEAST GAMES UNLESS IF YOU HAVE SOME QUICK LEARNERS ONUS WAS MY FIRST SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAME AND I CONSIDER MYSELF A QUICK LEARNER AND IT TOOK ME AT LEAST GAMES TO REALLY GET IT AND TO UNDER WHEN TO LIE AND WHEN NOT TO LIE

AS SIMPLE AS THE GAME IS I ACTUALLY DON'T CONSIDER IT A GATEWAY SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAME ANYMORE
NOT WORTH IT BY ITSELF SHIPPING IS RIDICULOUS DEFINITELY CHECK IT OUT IF YOU ARE ORDERING OTHER ITEMS AS WELL THOUGH
NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO WANT TO PLAY ALL THE TIME LIKE YOU BUT AFTER THE FIRST FEW TIMES YOU WILL FIND THOSE FRIENDS THAT ARE ALWAYS UP FOR A GAME NIGHT

FOR MY PERSONAL FRIENDS IT STARTED AS A GET TOGETHER WE JUST WANTED TO HANG OUT BUT NOT GO OUT AND BLOW MONEY SO I INVITED THEM ALL OVER FOR A GAME NIGHT I PROVIDED THE PIZZA AND SOME DRINKS BUT EVERYONE IS ALWAYS UP TO BRING DRINKS OR CHIPS ON THEIR OWN

THOSE FRIENDS STILL COME AROUND ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN THEIR SCHEDULE ISN'T SO BUSY THEY KNOW THAT COMING OVER TO MY PLACE TO HANG OUT DRINK AND PLAY IS ALWAYS AN OPTION THEY SOMETIMES EVEN INVITE THEIR FRIENDS AND COWORKERS TO JOIN AND IT'S ALWAYS A BLAST I DO KIND OF LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING OVER AHEAD OF TIME JUST SO I CAN PREPARE PROPERLY WITH THE RIGHT GAMES OR DRINKS

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND STARTING OFF WITH A MOVIE WATCHING A MOVIE MELLOWS EVERYONE OUT AND PUTS THEM IN A RESTING STATE EVEN AFTER THE MOVIE IS OVER SO EITHER FEEL LIKE YOUR FORCING A GAME ON THEM OR EVERYONE WILL BE TO DRAINED TO WANT TO STIMULATE THEIR MIND AND MIGHT JUST WANT TO CHAT INSTEAD BUT THERE IS ALWAYS SOME QUICK GAMES THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE USUALLY UP TO PLAY LIKE CODEWORDS JUNGLE SPEED OR OTHER SMALL QUICK GAMES BUT I WOULD INSTEAD MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A GAME NIGHT RATHER THAN GAME AND MOVIE NIGHT SO EVERYONE KNOWS TO COME OVER WITH THAT MINDSET

ALSO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND THAT NOT ALL GAMES ARE FOR EVERYONE SOME PEOPLE WILL HATE CERTAIN GAMES THAT OTHERS LOVE AND WILL BE TURNED AWAY AT THE MERE MENTION OF THE GAME JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT THEIR CUP OF TEA SO DON'T BE DISCOURAGED

FOR EVERYONE S FIRST TIME MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE PREPARED TO TEACH MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RULES RIGHT AND DON'T MAKE THE EXPLANATIONS TRY AND KNOW THE ANSWERS TO POSSIBLE QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE ASKED WHILE TEACHING SOME GUESTS ARE IMPATIENT AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS AND HAVE TO DIVE IN THE RULEBOOK YOU MIGHT TURN SOME PEOPLE AWAY IT'S NOT ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT LIKE I SAID SOME PEOPLE ARE IMPATIENT

I PERSONALLY STARTED MY FRIENDS WITH EASIER GAMES LIKE KING OF TOKYO TICKET TO RIDE DIXIT CA H N GUNS ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WARWOLF AND OTHER SIMPLER GAMES LIKE THOSE JUST TO SHOW THEM HOW FUN MODERN BOARD GAMES CAN BE AND THEN EVENTUALLY BUILT THEM UP TO MORE AND MORE COMPLEX GAMES

DON'T PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOURSELF MOST PEOPLE WILL LOVE IT AND MIGHT WANT TO IMMEDIATELY WANT TO TRY AGAIN SOONER RATHER THAN LATER AND OTHER JUST WANT TO DO IT ON OCCASION YOU JUST CAN'T SATISFY EVERYONE ALL OF THE TIME AS LONG AS THE MAJORITY HAD A GREAT TIME YOU CAN CONSIDER IT A SUCCESS AND IF PEOPLE THAT ARE SKEPTICAL SEE THEIR FRIENDS ENJOYING THEMSELVES THEY ARE INFLUENCED TO KEEP GIVING IT ANOTHER SHOT AND SEE THAT IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT THE GAME ITSELF BUT ABOUT HAVING A GOOD TIME TOGETHER

I WENT IN WITH THIS MINDSET WHEN I CREATED AND STARTED HOSTING A BOARD GAME NEETUP FOR MY COMMUNITY AND I GET REGULARS AND NEWIES THAT FILL UP THE SPOTS TO MY NEETUP ALL THE TIME JUST REMEMBER TO ENJOY YOURSELF AND EVERYONE WILL HAVE FUN WITH YOU GOOD LUCK ON YOUR FIRST GAME NIGHT
UGHHHH MOVIES AT GAME NIGHT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD DRIVE ME AWAY THAT'S LIKE 2 HOURS OF GAME TIME WASTED
HONESTLY THE BIGGEST FACTORS I'VE FOUND IN KEEPING A GROUP MOTIVATED ARE AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULING AND CLEAR EXPECTATIONS EVERYONE IN MY MAIN GROUP LOVES TO PLAY GAMES BUT WE'RE ALL ADULTS WITH BUSY SCHEDULES SO GAME DAYS CAN NEVER HAPPEN ON THE FLY OR WITH SOFT COMMITMENTS SOMEONE HAS TO STEP UP AND BE A TASK MASTER IN MY GROUP THAT'S ME AND I MAKE SURE TO HAVE EVERYONE COMMITTED TO A DAY TIME AND PLACE DAYS AHEAD OF TIME ONCE I HAVE EVERYONE'S AVAILABILITY I JUST PICK A TIME THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE AND TELL THEM THAT'S WHEN ITS GOING TO HAPPEN SO THAT THERE'S NO FURTHER ARGUMENT AROUND THAT TIME WE ALSO DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO PLAY SO THAT EVERYONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO EXPECT AND THERE'S NO ARGUMENT OVER WHAT WE'RE PLAYING AT THE NEETUP ITSELF IN THE END THE FURTHER EVERYONE CAN PLAN THE GAME NIGHT INTO THEIR SCHEDULE AND THE LESS THEY HAVE TO FUSS OVER THE DETAILS THE SMOOTHER EVERYTHING GOES THE MORE WILLING THEY ARE TO KEEP COMING BACK AND THE MORE CONSISTENT THE GAME DAYS GET
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO KEEP COMING TO YOUR GAME NIGHTS THEN YOU HAVE TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE SEAT OF A HOST RATHER THAN A GAMER AS A HOST YOUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS HAVING A GOOD TIME IF THAT INVOLVES YOU SITTING THERE AND PLAYING MUNCHKIN FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF VISITS THEN SO BE IT IF EVERYONE IS HAVING A GOOD TIME AND IS COMFORTABLE THEN DOWN THE ROAD YOU CAN TRY TO ADJUST THE GAME NIGHT INTO WHAT YOU DESIRE BUT IF YOU LAY THAT ON TOO HEAVY TO START PEOPLE WILL NOT RETURN I DON'T HAVE NIGHTMARE SITUATIONS FOR MYSELF BUT I GET COMPLEMENTS ALL THE TIME ON HOW PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED THAT THEY CAN PLAY AT MY PLACE AND REALLY PLAY WHAT THEY WANT TO PLAY
I HOST A BOARD GAME GROUP THAT I'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR CLOSE TO YEARS NOW AND AT THIS POINT IT IS THRIVING AND A HIGHLIGHT OF MY WEEK I'VE BEEN TOLD BY SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT COME THAT ITS THEIR FAVORITE GAME GROUP THEY'VE BEEN TO SO I GUESS THAT MEANS I'M DOING SOMETHING RIGHT WHAT WE DO IS A WEEKLY POT LUCK ON SUNDAYS FROM TILL USUALLY AT LEAST OR I SAY POT LUCK BUT REALLY I MAKE A BAKED ZITI SOMEONE BRINGS A SALAD AND THEN EVERYONE ELSE BRINGS CHIPS BEER DESSERT ETC HERE ARE SOME THINGS WHICH I WOULD SAY HAVE MADE IT SUCCESSFUL

SETUP A GROUP IN THE BEGINNING SOME OF MY FRIENDS CAME BUT THEY WEREN'T AS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT GAMING AS ME OVER TIME NEW PEOPLE STARTED TO SHOW UP BECAUSE OF NEETUP AND NOW THEY'RE GOOD FRIENDS AND COME EVERY WEEK ITS ALSO JUST A GOOD WAY TO LET PEOPLE KNOW IF YOU'RE CANCELLING AND IT LETS YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE ARE COMING ETC

2 BEING A GOOD HOST I'LL ECHO WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID HERE IF YOU WANT THE GROUP TO BE SUCCESSFUL SOMETIMES THAT MEANS AS HOST YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE HIT SOMETIMES THAT MEANS LETTING OTHER PEOPLE SIT IN ON THE GAME YOU WANT TO PLAY WHILE YOU PLAY SOMETHING MORE BEGINNER FRIENDLY WITH NEW PEOPLE OR IF ITS ALL BEGINNERS GOING THROUGH GAMES THAT YOU MIGHT BE BORED OF BUT ARE GAMES THEY ARE EXCITED TO PLAY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST BREAKING IN ARE EXCITED ABOUT SETTLER OF CATAN OR TICKET TO RIDE OR MUNCHKIN WHILE EXPERIENCED GAMERS MIGHT ROLL THEIR EYES AT THOSE GAMES AS HOST YOU KIND OF HAVE TO FEEL IT OUT ALSO AND THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THE WORST THING AS HOST YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF KEEPING THINGS CIVIL THAT MEANS IF YOU NOTICE SEXIST RACIST ETC LANGUAGE ITS UP TO YOU TO MAKE IT STOP IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE SHOW UP ONCE AND NEVER COME BACK ESPECIALLY WOMEN

BE CONSISTENT I DO IT EVERY WEEK AT THE SAME TIME IN THE BEGINNING THERE WERE WEEKS THAT NOBODY SHOWED AND I JUST DID OTHER THINGS INSTEAD BUT ONCE IT BECAME ESTABLISHED THAT IT WAS HAPPENING EVERY WEEK I THINK THAT REALLY MADE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE IT PART OF THEIR ROUTINE SOME PEOPLE WHO COME ARE REGULARS SOME PEOPLE ONLY COME OCCASIONALLY I THINK FOR BOTH OF THOSE GROUPS THEY WOULD COME LESS OFTEN IF IT REQUIRED MORE COORDINATION TO SHOW UP

FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE OF GAMING AND SOCIAL THE PACING OF MY GAME NIGHT TENDS TO BE SOCIAL AS PEOPLE ARRIVE THEN LIGHTER GAMING WITH SNACKS AND DRINKS AND MORE CHATTING POSSIBLY A MEDIUM WEIGHT GAME THEN DINNER IS A BREAK WITH NO GAMING AND JUST SOCIAL THEN A HEAVIER GAME AFTER DINNER AND CLOSE OUT THE NIGHT POSSIBLY WITH ONE OR TWO LIGHTER GAME WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL THERE OTHER GAMING GROUPS I HAVE BEEN TO ARE PURE GAMING WITH NO DOWNTIME OR GETTING TO KNOW PEOPLE AND ITS JUST NOT AS MUCH FUN
WE ALL HAVE THE SAME PARENTS
LIVING IN A COUNTRY WITH LONG WINTERS SEEMS TO HELP SWITCHING UP GAMES INTRODUCING NEW PEOPLE AND DIFFERENT EVENTS CAN ALSO HELP A MIX OF INDOOR AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CAN HELP KEEP THINGS FEELING FRESH
SET A TIME AND DATE WEEKS IN ADVANCE AND TELL PEOPLE THE MAIN GAME THAT IS GOING TO BE PLAYED SO THEY CAN RESEARCH THE GAME OR WATCH A VIDEO REVIEW
AND NO DRINKS ON THE TABLE
OUR BG GROUPS ARE USUALLY COUPLE FRIENDS OF OURS SO ASIDE OF FOOD AND FRIENDS IT'S THE GREAT GAMES WE PLAY
I'M GOING TO START WITH COSMIC ENCOUNTER THE POINT OF THE GAME IS TO ESTABLISH COLONIES IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOME SYSTEMS HOWEVER THE PERSON YOU WILL BE ATTACKING IS CHOSEN AT RANDOM FROM A DECK OF CARDS THEN IT'S UP TO YOU TO TRY NEGOTIATIONS CALL ON ALLIES OR JUST CHARGE ON INTO BATTLE IT IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE GAME

IF YOU LIKED THE CO-OP ASPECT OF BETRAYAL I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND PANDEMIC ALTHOUGH IT'S A LOW PLAYER COUNT SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT ELDRITCH HORROR OR EVEN DEAD OF WINTER
OF THE GAMES THAT YOU LISTED WHAT DO YOU LIKE WHAT DON'T YOU LIKE

BASED ON THE LIMITED INFORMATION THAT YOU GAVE I WOULD SAY BETWEEN TWO CITIES WHICH IS A COMPETITIVE GAME WHERE YOU WORK TOGETHER WITH EACH PERSON ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU IN ORDER TO BUILD TWO CITIES I'D ALSO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE STONE AGE OR ISTANBUL WHICH ARE EUROS WHERE YOUR OPPONENTS MAY BLOCK YOU FROM TAKING CERTAIN OPTIONS OR MAKE OPTIONS MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOU

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING SHORTER DEEP SEA ADVENTURE IS A GREAT OPTION IT'S A FUN PUSH YOUR LUCK GAME WHERE EVERYONE IS SHARING THE SAME AIR TO GO DIVE AND GET TREASURE THE GREEDIER YOU ARE THE MORE LIKELY YOUR FELLOW DIVERS WILL DROWN WITHOUT BRINGING BACK ANY TREASURE
YOU REALLY HAVE TO PLAY AROUND WITH YOUR OPPONENTS TO DO WELL

THAT COULD MEAN A LOT OF THINGS DO YOU MEAN A GAME WHERE YOUR OPPONENTS WORK WITH YOU IN ORDER FOR YOU TO GET WHAT YOU WANT OR A GAME WHERE YOU MANIPULATE YOUR OPPONENTS TO SETTING YOURSELF UP
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TAKE A LOOK AT BRASS PLAYERS THE WHOLE GAME REVOLVES AROUND PREDICTING AND FULFILLING THE NEEDS OF YOUR OPPONENTS TO YOUR BENEFIT IT'S SIMILAR IN COMPLEXITY TO TERRA MYSTIC

KEYFLOWER PLAYERS HAS A BIT OF THAT ELEMENT AS WELL SINCE YOU PAY THE OTHER PLAYERS TO USE THEIR WORKER PLACEMENT TILES

LASTLY I WOULD SUGGEST DOMINANT SPECIES PLAYERS WHERE YOU'RE REALLY TIED UP WITH THE OTHER PLAYERS BUT THAT'S A HOUR GAME
DDK WHAT YOU MEAN PLAY AROUND WITH YOUR OPPONENTS IF YOU'RE TALKING LIKE TERRA MYSTIC WHERE YOU TEND TO JUST GET IN EACH WAY AND ENGINE BUILD AROUND EACH OTHER SCYTHE IS FANTASTIC

IF YOU MEAN HELP THEM TO HELP YOU COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM IS A BLUFFING GAME WHERE BRIBES AND THE OCCASIONAL FALSE PROMISE ARE QUITE IMPORTANT
CHECK VIA NEBULA IT IS A GAME WHERE MOST OF THE ACTIONS A PLAYER TAKES WILL HELP THEIR OPPONENTS
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL EURO GAMES FOR A WHILE LOOK INTO DOMAINE IT'S BEST WITH OR MORE
IMPERIAL
CONTAINER
KING CHOCOLATE
GERMAN RAILWAYS
CHICAGO EXPRESS
PARIS CONNECTION

SHAKESPEARE IT HAS BLIND BIDDING AS MAIN PART OF THE GAME WHICH WILL GIVE POINT EVERY TURN FOR BEST BIDDER AS WELL AS DETERMINE NUMBER OF ACTION PLAYER HAS IN THAT ROUND COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT USED CHARACTERS IN ONE ROUND CAN'T BE USED IN NEXT ROUND LOW SCORES AND NEED TO PAY CHARACTERS AT THE END OF THE GAME WHILE MONEY IS TIGHT MAKES CHOICES IN THE GAME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ON TOP OF THAT IT LOOKS GREAT
SEMI COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE PLAYERS ARE AGAINST EACH OTHER UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER SO THEY ALL DON'T LOOSE THE GAME EVERY PLAYER IS CEO OF AN ENERGY COMPANY THAT NEEDS TO ADD GREEN PLANTS AND STOP POLLUTION BY REDUCING FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU NEED TO PROPOSE PROJECT INSTALL PROJECT AND CONSTRUCT POWER PLANT WHILE IN THE PROCESS OTHER PLAYERS CAN CONTINUE WHERE YOU STOPPED UNTIL POWER PLANT IS CONSTRUCTED WHICH MEANS YOU CAN PREPARE EVERYTHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE EVEN THAT IS NOT YOUR INTENTION
GUILDHALL HIGHLY INTERACTIVE CARD GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO CREATE SETS OF CARDS OF THE SAME PROFESSION CHARACTERS IN DIFFERENT COLORS EVERY TIME YOU PLAY A CARD DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF THE SAME TYPE OF CARD ON YOUR TABLEAU YOU CAN USE ITS SPECIAL ABILITIES WHICH CAN DO SOMETHING TO OPPONENTS SETS
NOW YOU SAID INTERACT WITH YOUR OPPONENTS DO YOU MEAN AS COOPERATIVELY OR COMPETITIVELY

ARCADIA QUEST IS KIND OF A RACE FOR OBJECTIVES AND ALSO PVP AT THE SAME TIME MAYBE IS AN OPTION ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE A BIT PRICEY
CHINATOWN BONANZA

BOTH ARE TRADING FOCUSED GAME WITHOUT THE OPPONENTS THEIR IS NOTHING TO DO
KEYFLOWER SOUNDS LIKE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT LOTS OF INTERACTION YOU USE YOUR OPPONENTS BOARDS TO ACQUIRE RESOURCES AND PLAY AROUND THEM TO ACQUIRE TILES IT GOES TO PLAYERS AND IT ISN'T IT'S RATED IN THE BG TOP FOR GOOD REASON
XANAX
CARCASSONNE AND RESISTANCE AVALON
I WANT TO BRING SUSHI GO MORE THAN ANYTHING BUT MY FAMILY REALLY AREN'T GAMES PEOPLE EVERY YEAR WE ALWAYS PLAY PARTY GAMES LIKE OR LOGO OR APPLES TO APPLES I'M NERVOUS ABOUT TAKING THE JUMP FROM ZERO STRATEGY TO SOME STRATEGY ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY AREN'T THE

TICKET TO RIDE EUROPE PARIS CONNECTION WIZARD AND MAYBE NEUE HEILMAN PC IS THE NEW ONE OF THE BUNCH I HAVE A CHANCE AT WINNING PC MY MOTHER IS A SHARK AT BOTH NH AND TR

SPLENDOR BECAUSE EVERYONE LIKES SPLENDOR

GOOD LIST ALSO MICE AND MYSTICS OR CONAN

U GETINFO

THE OTHERS

IS A BLAST MORE ABOUT KILLING MONSTERS AND CLEANSING FIRES OR CORRUPTION OR EVEN SAVING SOME INNOCENTS TAKING CORRUPTION TO GET STRONGER ALL WHILE THE SIN'S MONSTERS TRY TO GET AND KILL YOUR TEAM

IT'S A VERY TACTICAL GAME EXTREMELY WELL BALANCED AND LOTS OF DICE ROLLING AND A LOT OF TAKE THAT AND DIRECT CONFRONTATION IT'S A VS ALL GAME PLAYS UP TO AND PLAYS AT ALL PLAYER COUNTS AND SCALES INCREDIBLY WELL THROUGHOUT
MECH VS MINIONS IS A PRETTY FUN GAME I LOVE LEVELING UP MY ABILITIES

WITH THAT SAID LAST NIGHT ON EARTH MAY BE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IT FITS AND HAS PLAYERS PLAY AS THE HUMANS AND THE OTHER 2 PLAY AS ZOMBIES IT HAS SEVERAL INCLUDED SCENARIOS SUCH AS DEFENDING A MANSION OR ESCAPING IN A TRUCK
MACHS VS MINIONS GOT ME INTO BOARD GAMES I'M HAPPY I PLAYED IT AND DISCOVERED BOARDGAME FUN I RECOMMEND IT
DEEP MADNESS IS STILL AT LEAST A YEAR AWAY FROM RELEASE NOVEMBER IF THERE'S NO DELAYS

IN THE MEANTIME WARHAMMER QUEST SILVER TOWER IS FUN AND NOT HARD TO LEARN BUT IT ONLY GOES UP TO PLAYERS
MACHS VS MINIONS IS FUN TO PLAY

OTHER GAMES MIGHT BE OF YOUR INTEREST ARCADIA QUEST
IN TERMS OF YOU'RE GOING TO BE HARD PRESSED TO BEAT MGM I MEAN LOOK AT THIS ALL THE GAMES YOU LIKE ARE BAD VIDEO WHERE HE GOES THROUGH THE BOX TO SEE WHAT YOU GET
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY PLAY VS AN OVERLORD OF SOME KIND OF WANT PURE COOP VERSUS AN OVERLORD TRY THE NEW CONAN GAME FOR PURE COOP TRY ZOMBICIDE BLACK PLAGUE FOR SIMPLE FUN DESCENT WITH THE FREE ROAD TO LEGEND APP IS MORE INVOLVED AND SUPPORTS PLAYER COOP PLAY I CAN'T THINK OF ANY MINIATURE FOCUSED GAME THAT PLAYS
WE ARE REALLY ENJOYING MANSIONS OF MADNESS AT THE MOMENT BUT TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST THE MINIATURES ARE NOT WELL DONE BEING APP DRIVEN MIGHT BE A TURN OFF SO MY RECOMMENDATION OTHERWISE WOULD BE IMPERIAL ASSAULT OR DESCENT IA IS A REIMPLEMENTATION OF DESCENT SO THE RULES AND GAMEPLAY ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR SO PICK THE ONE THAT HAS THE BETTER THEME FOR YOU AND YOUR GROUP
IT'S NOT SUPER MINI BASED BUT THERE MINIS ANIS
ALL AROUND A GREAT GAME SIMPLE TO LEARN AND AMAZING GET IT I'M IN CANADA TOO I KNOW HAS A FEW COPIES
GO BIG WITH KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER OR GO HOME OH I THINK THE KICKSTARTER IS RELEASING THIS FRIDAY

ON A SIDE NOTE WHY NOT TRY SOME CMON GAMES LIKE ARCADIA QUEST OR ZOMBICIDE NOT SURE IF IT'S THE ADVENTURE YOU WANT BUT I HEARD THEY ARE PRETTY FUN
R BOARDGAMEDEALS
I GOT CODENAMES AS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE AND PICKED UP PANDEMIC FOR ME I HOPE IT'S AS FUN AS EVERYONE SAYS IT IS
WHY IS PANDEMIC IN THE LAB NOT ON SALE ARGH
I OWNED BOTH SOLD PATHFINDER DON'T DO IT JUST DON'T YOU'LL BE TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED GO GET THE MARKHAM CG IT'S FANTASTIC
I HONESTLY FOUND PATHFINDER PRETTY BORING I FELT LIKE THE CARDS DIDN'T COMBO INTERACT ENOUGH TO BE INTERESTING AND THE THEMING DIDN'T MAKE UP FOR IT

THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO LOVED THE GAME PLAY OF CROSSFIRE AND DECK BUILDERS LIKE STAR REALMS AND IS A BIG FANTASY FAN
FIRST OF ALL WARHAMER QUEST ACS IS WAY DIFFERENT THAN PATHFINDER ACS

THERE IS A GOOD DIGITAL VERSION OF PATHFINDER ROTC IOS AND ANDROID THAT IS FREE TO PLAY WITH IGNAME CURRENCY UNLOCKS FOR MORE CHARACTERS CHAPTERS OR MICROTRANSACTION UNLOCKS THAT SHOWS HOW THE GAMEPLAY WORKS

PERSONALLY SKULLS AND SHACKLES IS THE ONLY ONE I HAVENT PLAYED YET BUT I DO LIKE THE PATHFINDER ACS SYSTEM IN GENERAL

ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THE PHYSICAL PATHFINDER ACS HAS QUITE A LONG SETUP TEARDOWN TIME EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE SORTED ALL OF THE DIFFERENT DECKS OUT
PATHFINDER WAS A GOOD IDEA THAT WAS EXECUTED POORLY IN MY OPINION

I PLAYED PATHFINDER AND IT'S NOW IN MY BOARDGAME DUNGEON OF HATED GAMES

LUCKILY IT GOT POPULAR AND NOW THERE ARE MANY SIMILAR GAMES
MISTFALL TOP RECOMMENDATION

LOAR CG THEY BASICALLY HAVE A CAMPAIGN MODE IF YOU GET THE SAGA EXPANSIONS NOT THE REGULAR EXPANSIONS

MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME


KICKSTARTERS THAT AREN'T OUT YET

APOCRYPHA

ADVENTURING

LEGENDS UNTOLD

SHADOWSCAPE



I PLAYED WARHAMMER ACS AND I LOVED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT EVERY EXPANSION OF LOAR DUE TO IT'S SIMILARITIES NOT MANY WOULD AGREE BUT IN MY EYES IT WAS A MORE ADVANCED VERSION OF WARHAMMER QUEST THE SAGA EXPANSIONS MADE IT EVEN MORE SIMILAR WITH A CAMPAIGN MODE

WARHAMMER ACS
IF YOU WANT A GAME THAT PLAYS LIKE D D IN TERMS OF STRONG NARRATIVE CAMPAIGNS WITH MULTIPLE PATHS GET THE NEW MARKHAM HORROR CG
PATHFINDER HAS MORE CHARACTER PROGRESSION AND INTERESTING LOOT THAN WARHAMMER BUT THE GAMEPLAY IS NOT VERY CHALLENGING IF YOU ARE A FAN OF DIFFICULT GAMES THERE'S NOTHING EVEN REMOTELY AS DIFFICULT AS WH ACS SCENARIO FOR EXAMPLE

INTERESTING DECISIONS ARE WHICH LOCATIONS THE GROUP SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON FIRST WHICH PIECES OF LOOT TO KEEP IN YOUR DECK AFTER THE SCENARIO AND YOUR CHARACTER FEATS MOST OF WHICH ARE OBVIOUS CHOICES INITIALLY THE GAMEPLAY ITSELF HAS VERY LITTLE SKILL INVOLVED YOU ARE EXPLORING YOUR CURRENT LOCATION AND ROLLING DICE MY PLAYGROUND LIKES BOTH GAMES THOUGH

OF THE FIRST PATHFINDER CAMPAIGNS I FOUND SKULL SHACKLES TO BE BY FAR THE BEST RISE OF THE RUNELORDS WAS TOO EASY EVEN PLAYING N LOCATIONS AS WE ALWAYS DO AND WRATH ALTHOUGH DIFFICULT IN THE B SCENARIOS DEMONIC HORDE ARBOREAL BLIGHT BECAME TRIVIAL AFTER ADVENTURES 2 DUE TO THE RIDICULOUS NUMBERS CHARACTERS GET TO PUT OUT BY THEN S S WAS THE PERFECT BALANCE

LOAR CG IS REALLY GOOD IF YOU LIKE DIFFICULT GAMES AND DECK BUILDING THE THIRD SCENARIO IN THE BASE SET WAS JUST RIDICULOUS
I HAVE PLAYED THE BASE GAME AND MAYBE 2 OR ADVENTURE DECKS IT'S ALRIGHT BUT NOTHING I WOULD PURCHASE IF YOU'RE REALLY INTO ACS THEN I'M SURE IT'S GOOD

IT'S VERY FLIP CARD BEAT CARD BUT THEN AGAIN I GUESS THAT IS WHAT ACS ARE ABOUT
NO IT'S STRICTLY HEAD TO HEAD
I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS WITH MY PARTNER USING THE COMPANION APP CHARACTERS 2 EACH AND DOING THE DELVE QUEST THEY RECENTLY ADDED AND IT'S REALLY QUITE DIFFICULT EVEN ON NORMAL MODE
CAN YOU PLAY THIS 2 PLAYER WITH BOTH PLAYERS BEING ON THE SAME SIDE
THERE ARE JUST AS MANY OPINIONS ON WHAT'S THE BEST EXPANSION AS THERE ARE EXPANSIONS THE TWO BIG BOX EXPANSIONS GIVE THE MOST CONTENT FOLLOWED BY THE SMALL BOX AND FINALLY THE HERO MONSTER PACKS THE LIEUTENANT PACKS HAVE THE LEAST USABILITY FOR THE PRICE THE BIG AND SMALL BOX EXPANSIONS COME WITH MINI CAMPAIGNS AND THE H M PACKS COME WITH A QUEST OR TWO THE FFA WEBSITE HAS A QUEST VAULT WHERE FANS CAN CREATE AND POST HOMEMADE QUESTS THE ROAD TO LEGEND APP COMES WITH ALL ITS OWN QUESTS SOME FREE SOME PAID AND A CO-OP PLAY STYLE

I PERSONALLY STARTED OUT BY PURCHASING A COUPLE OF H M PACKS NEXT I GOT LAIR OF THE WARM SMALL BOX AND RECENTLY RECEIVED LABYRINTH OF RUIN BIG BOX FOR MY BIRTHDAY I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH ALL MY PURCHASES AND HAVE EVEN PAINTED THE MINIATURES MY NEXT PAINTING PROJECT WITH BE LOR MINIATURES
SOME OTHER GAMES THAT FOLLOW THE SAME FORMULA OF EVIL PLAYER AND MANY GOOD PLAYERS ARE IMPERIAL ASSAULT TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES SHADOWS OF THE PAST MANSIONS OF MADNESS SUPER DUNGEON EXPLORE AND OF COURSE HEROQUEST

IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS BASICALLY STAR WARS DESCENT AND TNT IS BY THE SAME DESIGNER SO NATURALLY IT CAPTURES THAT SAME FEEL OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE BOTH GREAT CHOICES IF YOU'RE INTO THOSE PARTICULAR IPS THE OTHER GAMES ARE MORE GENERIC FANTASY THEMED LIKE DESCENT IS AND USE THE VS ALL MECHANIC BUT ARE UNRELATED TO THE DESCENT FAMILY TREE AS FOR THE DESCENT EXPANSIONS GO SLOW WITH BUYING THEM THERE'S SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF OR OF THEM AND IT'S VERY EASY TO BUY MORE THAN YOU CAN PLAY

THERE ARE ALSO TONS OF OTHER CO-OP ONLY DUNGEON GAMES LIKE MICE AND MYSTICS THE D D BOARD GAME TRIO SWORDS AND SORCERY MASSIVE DARKNESS DUNGEON RUN MYTH GEARS OF WAR LEGENDS OF ANDOR AND HEAPS OF OTHERS IF YOU FIND YOU PREFER PLAYING WITH DESCENT'S APPARENTLY

U GETINFO
FOR THE CO-OP ADVENTURES AVAILABLE FROM FF PRINTING DO YOU NEED ANY OTHER PARTICULAR EXPANSIONS TO PLAY THEM OR JUST WHAT'S IN THE BASE GAME
CAN YOU PLAY SECOND EDITION WITHOUT THE APP I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE A MANDATORY THING
I SPENT A YEAR OR MORE WITH THIS ON MY WISELIEST AND FINALLY PULLED THE TRIGGER AND BOUGHT IT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO I WASN'T SURE IF MY GROUP WOULD REALLY TAKE TO IT AS IT TURNS OUT THE PROBLEM WE HAVE NOW IS EVERYONE WANTS TO PLAY DESCENT AND WE HAVE TO LIMIT ATTENDANCE TO JUST PLAYERS FOR GAMES NIGHT

I AM REALLY GLAD IT IS PART OF MY COLLECTION AND WE ARE CURRENTLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE BASE CAMPAIGN BUT SOME OF THE ENCOUNTERS SEEM UNFAIRLY BIASED IN FAVOUR OF THE OVERLORD SEVERAL OF THE ADVENTURE WE HAVE PLAYED ARE AND I DON'T SEE HOW I THE OVERLORD COULD HAVE LOST THOSE GAMES WITHOUT SOME SERIOUS INCOMPETENCE ON MY PART

I AM ALMOST AT THE POINT OF KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE AND JUST ADDING IN AN EXTRA HERO CHARACTER TO EVERY ADVENTURE TO EVEN THINGS UP OF AT LEAST TO THE ONES WHERE IT SEEMS THE HEROES DON'T STAND A CHANCE
WELCOME TO TERRINOTH I'VE BEEN ENJOYING DESCENT SINCE THE 1ST EDITION RELEASED THERE'S A LOT TO SEEP YOU BUSY
THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME FOR RIGHT NOW PLAYING SOLO WITH THE APPARENTLY I PLAY HEROES WHEN I HAVE A FEW HOURS TO KILL AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT I JUST GOT THE FIRST AND AM GOING THROUGH THE KINDRED FIRE CAMPAIGN FOR THE SECOND TIME USING SOME OF THE ADDED CLASSES FROM THE

FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME
I HAVE IT AS WELL BUT I'VE FOUND THAT BEEN THE OVERLORD IS QUITE DIFFICULT AS THE GAME SEEMS TO BE A BIT UNBALANCED TOWARDS THE HEROES
THIS GAME RULES I JUST PICKED IT UP ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND PRETTY MUCH HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT ANY OTHER GAME I OWN
STAR WARS REBELLION IS A FANTASTIC TWO PLAYER GAME THEY SAY YOU CAN PLAY PLAYER BUT I THINK IT WOULD JUST TAKE AWAY FROM THE GAME PLAY AND DRAW OUT THE GAME LENGTH
HERE ARE THE TOP STAR WARS GAMES ON THE MARKET

IMPERIAL ASSAULT SCENARIO OR SKIRMISHED BASED TACTICAL COMBAT THINK SMUGGLES AND JEDI FIGHTING IT OUT WITH STORM-TROOPER

SHIP TO SHIP COMBAT WITH A FOCUS ON MANEUVERING

ARMADA FIGHTING WITH LARGER SIZE CAPITAL SHIPS

REBELLION MASSIVE RECREATION OF THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS TRILOGY EMPIRE PLAYER HUNTING FOR THE REBEL BASE REBELS TRYING TO RAISE THE GALAXY AGAINST THE EMPIRE BEFORE THAT HAPPENS

STAR WARS RISK NOT RISK AT ALL BUT SEVERAL SIMPLE GAMES AT ONCE THAT RECREATE THE RETURN OF THE JEDI LUKE FIGHTING DARTH FIGHTING ON BAVIN TO GET THE SHIELDS DOWN ON THE DEATH STAR FIGHTERS TRYING TO DESTROY THE DEATH STAR ETC

STAR WARS DESTINY NEW COLLECTIBLE DICE GAME THAT HAS CHARACTERS FIGHTING AGAINST EACH OTHER

STAR WARS THE CARD GAME STAR WARS CG
IS GREAT BUT CAN GET EXPENSIVE IT HAS SIMPLE RULES THAT ARE EASY TO LEARN BUT THE COMBAT MECHANICS ARE PRETTY DEEP MAKING EACH GAME A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE

IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS ALSO AWESOME IF YOU LIKE D D LIKE DUNGEON CRAWLS

I HEAR GOOD THINGS ABOUT DESTINY BUT ITS NOT OUT YET
IMPERIAL ASSAULT
I'D RECOMMEND STAR WARS RISK IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RISK BUT IS A FANTASTIC GAME AND WORKS VERY WELL FOR 2 PLAYERS ALSO CAN PLAY IT AS A TEAM OF 2 EACH

I GOT IT AS A GIFT AND I LOVED IT


WHAT KIND OF BOARDGAMES HAVE YOU PLAYED BEFORE JUST FOR CONTEXT THERE ARE A KOT OF STAR WARS BOARDGAMES THAT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT STYLES DIFFERENT COMPLEXITIES ETC SO YOU CAN PICK UP SOMETHING THAT FIT YOUR TASTES
I LIKE THE STAR WARS RETHEME OF BATTLE LINES
I'M AN AVID PLAYER SO I'M GOING TO MAKE THAT SUGGESTION IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND A LOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST PRINT LISTS FROM THE INTERNET ONLY PEOPLE GOING TO TOURNAMENTS NEED PHYSICAL COPIES OF THE CARDS I EVEN HAVE A GUY AT MY LOCAL STORE PROXYING ENTIRE SHIPS IT MIGHT NOT BE PRETTY BUT IT DOES THE JOB

I HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT STAR WARS REBELLION IS PRETTY GREAT AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE ASYMMETRIC MULTIPLAYER
STAR WARS REBELLION IS AMAZING AND PLAYS GREAT FOR TWO OR MORE
IS A LOT OF FUN HOWEVER IT CAN BE A MONEY PIT SO BE WARY

THE BASE SET JUST GIVES YOU ENOUGH TO PLAY A VERY BASIC GAME AND I THINK IT WOULD GET A BIT DULL AFTER A FEW PLAYS HOWEVER IF YOU BUY ADDITIONAL SHIPS MINIMUM IT ADDS TO THE PLAYABILITY SOME SAY YOU SHOULD GET TWO BASE SETS BUT THAT CAN GET PRICEY I ONLY GOT A SECOND BASE SET BECAUSE I FOUND ONE ON SALE OFF AND I COULDN'T PASS IT UP


I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY SINGLE PLAYER STAR WARS BOARD GAMES IF ONLY PLAYING WITH 2 THEN I'D GO WITH REBELLION IF MORE THAN THAT THEN I WOULD SUGGEST IMPERIAL ASSAULT OR ARMADA
EPIC DUELS IS GREAT ESP WITH KIDS BUT MIGHT BE TRICKY TO TRACK DOWN AS IT'S OOP
CODENAMES PICTURES OR SPYFAULT OR COUP BASED ON YOUR LIST DOES SHE HAVE A BOARDGAMEGEEK PROFILE SHE MIGHT HAVE A WISELIEST YOU COULD ALSO ASK WHAT GAME SHE DOESN'T HAVE BUT RECOMMENDS YOU GET FOR CHRISTMAS FROM YOUR INSERT RELATIVE HERE YOU'LL GET AN IDEA OF WHAT SHE LIKES AND IT'S ALWAYS FUNNY TO CON SOMEONE INTO TELLING YOU WHAT TO GET THEM
THE DICE TOWER GUYS JUST DID A WHOLE SERIES OF VIDEOS ABOUT GIFT IDEAS CHECK THAT OUT

MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG
SINCE YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ALL THE GAMES SHE HAS OR WHAT EXACT TASTE IN BOARD GAME SHE HAS I MIGHT RECOMMEND GETTING BOARD GAME ACCESSORIES INSTEAD IF I GIFT SOMEONE WHO LIKES WINE BUT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WINE IS GOOD WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF ME FINDING THE RIGHT WINE AMONG HUNDRED VARIETIES IT IS EASIER TO JUST GIFT A BOTTLE OPENER WINE COOLER NICE WINE GLASSES ETC

FOR BOARD GAMES THERE ARE MANY THINGS AS WELL A DICE TOWER A PLAYMAN NICE SET OF DICE METAL GAME COINS TOKENS A CARD SHUFFLER A DICE TRAY AND SO ON
LOVE LETTER PREMIUM EDITION ALLOWS FOR A HIGH PLAYER COUNT UP TO I BELIEVE SIMILAR TO THE GAMES YOU HAVE LISTED I HAVEN'T PLAYED THE PREMIUM EDITION BUT I HAVE PLAYED THE ORIGINAL MANY TIMES AND IT'S A GREAT LIGHT FILLER GAME
MAYBE COSMIC ENCOUNTER SCALES TO A HIGHER NUMBER OF PLAYERS DEPENDING ON NUMBER OF EXPANSIONS OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY LOTS OF PLAYER INTERACTION LOTS OF REPLACEABILITY DUE TO THE VARIABLE PLAYER POWERS AND LOTS OF PLAYER INTERACTION MAKING DEALS AND STABBING PEOPLE IN THE BACK
DO YOU KNOW IF SHE ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES IN PARTICULAR OR IS THAT LIST SO FULL OF THEM JUST BECAUSE THEY WORK WELL IN YOUR SOCIAL GROUP

IF SHE WANTS MORE SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES THEN I WOULD RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT COUP SPYFAULT CODENAMES PICTURES OR MURDER DECEPTION IN HONG KONG

OR YOU COULD GO A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ROUTE WITH SOMETHING LIKE BANG THE DICE GAME DARK MOON OR SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT FOR A DIFFERENT STYLE OF BOARD GAME WITH A BIG SOCIAL DEDUCTION ASPECT TO THEM
CHECK THIS BG THREAD
I HAVE NEVER FELT IT TO BE OVERPOWERED BUT HERE ARE A FEW THOUGHTS

YOU MENTION THE LOCATIONS USING GAMBLING DEN AS A JUMPING OFF POINT IN A WAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT RANDOMIZING SETUP ACCORDING TO THE RULEBOOK IF YOU'VE PLAYED ENOUGH GAMES TO HAVE A SET STRATEGY YOU SHOULD BE RANDOMIZING THE BOARD

ARE YOU FOLLOWING ALL THE SETUP FOR 2 PLAYER ISTANBUL PLACING UNUSED MERCHANTS ON SEVERAL SPACES MEANING YOU'D NEED TO PAY THOSE

COFFEE EXPANSION WHEN YOU ADD IN COFFEE HALF THE GAMES ARE NO LONGER AS DEPENDENT ON MOSQUE TILES
IF SOMEONE BEELINES FOR THE RED MOSQUE TILE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THEY'LL PROBABLY WANT TO GO TO THE TEA HOUSE OR THE BLACK MARKET EITHER WAY YOU FORCE THEM TO TAKE AN INEFFICIENT TURN ISTANBUL ISN'T THAT SOLITAIRE
I DON'T BUT AM ALSO INTERESTED IN THE MEANTIME THE CARD GAME IS REALLY CHEAP LIKE TEN BUCKS AND IT HAS A GREAT SOLO VARIANT INCLUDED
I JUST GOOGLED THIS TWO SECONDS AGO I LIKE THIS VARIANT HOWEVER I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH MOST TRY TO GET MORE POINTS THAN LAST TIME VARIANTS I'M INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT ELSE YOU FIND


I KNOW THIS ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THE CARD GAME HAS AN OFFICIAL SOLO VARIAN THAT COMES WITH THE RULEBOOK IT HAS A LARGE FOOTPRINT FOR SUCH A SMALL BOX BUT I REALLY ENJOY THE GAME
I'VE PLAYED THIS ONE A COUPLE OF TIMES IT IS PRETTY DECENT BUT CAN BE A BIT TEDIOUS TO SET UP AND GET THE HANG OF IT IMPROVES WITH EXPERIENCE BUT I PREFER THE OTHER ONE WHICH WAS POSTED
THE ONE THAT WAS LINKED IS PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE FROM THAT SAME THREAD I ALSO DO THIS PLAYING TWO BOARDS TOGETHER TRYING TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING IN EACH OTHERS WAY AND MAXIMIZING THE SCORE FOR BOTH

CASTLES OF BURGUNDY THE CARD AI IS PRETTY BORING ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T INTERACT WITH YOU OR DO MUCH OTHER THAN PROVIDE A RANDOM SCORING CONDITION EACH ROUND YOU LOSE IMMEDIATELY IF YOUR POINT TOTAL IS LOWER THAN HIS I JUST LEAVE THE AI OUT WHEN I PLAY THOUGH A LOT SIMPLER AND LESS INVOLVED AND THUS LESS FUN THE CARD GAME IS WORTH IT FOR THE PRICE IT TAKES LIKE A THIRD OF THE TIME TO PLAY THERE'S NO SPATIAL ASPECT INVOLVED IT'S MORE OR LESS A SET COLLECTING GAME
ONE YOU CAN GET RIGHT AWAY LOL
WELL DO YOU WANT IT NOW OR A YEAR FROM NOW
POR QUE NO LOS DOS
ALLERGIST SEEMS TO ME TO BE SLIGHTLY LESS COMPLICATED AND PERHAPS EASIER TO TEACH I'VE HAD GOOD SUCCESS TEACHING ALLERGIST TO THOSE THAT ARE NEWER TO HEAVY GAMES HOWEVER IF YOU WANT A STREAMLINED VITAL EXPERIENCE CHECK OUT THE VINTAGE OF VINOS DELUXE EDITION BOTH THE AND EDITIONS OF THE GAME ARE INCLUDED IN THE BOX AND THE VERSION IS ACTUALLY VERY EASY TO TEACH AND IS A GREAT INTRODUCTION TO GAMES
IS HIS BEST AND PROBABLY ALSO HIS SIMPLEST GAME

I'VE PLAYED EVERY ONE OF HIS GAMES AND I SAW LISBOA DEMODE AT BG CON THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT ABLE PLAY IT AND THE ALLERGIST IS DEFINITELY THE SIMPLER OF THE TWO YOU MENTION
IT CURRENTLY SEEMS THAT LISBOA IS MOST COMPLICATED GAME YET ESPECIALLY VISUALLY SOURCES SHADO PAUL GROGAN HJELMBERG
I HAVE PLAYED LISBOA A FEW TIMES NOW ON TABLETOPIA AS WELL AS THE ALLERGIST AND I ACTUALLY FEEL THE OPPOSITE OF MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE I ENJOY MY TIME PLAYING LISBOA MUCH MORE THAN THE ALLERGIST AND I FEEL THAT IT HAS A MUCH CLEARER PATHOLOGY I THINK THE ALLERGIST MAY BE SIMPLER TO LEARN THE TURN STRUCTURE BUT I FOUND IT MUCH MORE CHALLENGING TO KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO ON A REGULAR BASIS THE GAME REALLY CONFUSED ME I FOUND LISBOA TO HAVE A MUCH CLEARER PICTURE OF WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE GAME IS AND THAT IN TRYING OUT HOW ALL THE PIECES COME TOGETHER YOU CAN DO QUITE WELL I THINK ONCE YOU GIVE LISBOA A CHANCE IT IS NOT THAT CHALLENGING IN FACT I'D SAY IT IS LIGHTER THAN HIS OTHER GAMES THE ICONOGRAPHY IS PRETTY DECENT AND IT'S REALLY QUITE MECHANICALLY SATISFYING I FOUND THE MECHANISMS IN THE ALLERGIST TO BE QUITE BORING TO BE HONEST I WOULD SAY LISBOA ALTHOUGH PEOPLE MAKE A GOOD POINT THAT LISBOA DOESN'T SHIP UNTIL JUNE AND YOU COULD GET THE ALLERGIST NOW ALSO LISBOA IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE


TL R IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY OR TIME FRAME I WOULD RECOMMEND LISBOA AS IN MY OPINION IT IS A MUCH BETTER GAME OTHERWISE GET THE ALLERGIST
NGAI

YOU STATED THAT YOU WOULD PRIMARILY PLAY SOLO OR 2 PLAYERS MOSTLY

THE ALLERGIST HAS A VERY COMPELLING AND CHALLENGING SOLO GAME MY WIFE GENERALLY HAS LITTLE PATIENCE WITH THE HEAVY BOARDGAMES I TEND TO LOVE BUT SHE REALLY LIKES PLAYING THE ALLERGIST AS SHE LOVES ART AND THEME IS ABOUT ARTICLE

YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT ON YOUTUBE WATCH IT PLAYED HAS A GREAT SERIES OF VIDEOS FOR THE ALLERGIST

HERE IS THE FIRST OF THE PART VIDEO SERIES
WATCH V

SOLO GAME HASN'T BEEN RELEASED YET BECAUSE VITAL ISN'T QUITE HAPPY WITH IT HE IS VERY CLOSE AND THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR IT SHOULD BE RELEASED BEFORE THE KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN ENDS LISBOA LOOKS DIFFICULT AND BUSY BUT ONCE YOU HAVE PLAYED A FEW TIMES THE FLOW IS VERY INTUITIVE AND EASY AFTER A FEW TURNS OF PLAYING I AM A SUPPORTER OF THE KICKSTARTER MY FIRST PLEDGE

I LIKE THAT VITAL IS NOW SPECIFICALLY DEVELOPING SOLO PLAY IN ALL OF HIS GAMES GOING FORWARD AS IT CAN BE CHALLENGING GETTING ENOUGH PEOPLE TO THE TABLE TO PLAY A CERTAIN GAME SOME OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS ONLY WANT TO PLAY CATAN OR PANDEMIC I WANT TO PLAY HEAVIER GAMES LIKE PANAMA ALLERGIST DOMINANT SPECIES MADEIRA KANKAN TWILIGHT STRUGGLE LABYRINTH AND VINOS VERSION
I PLAYED LISBOA THIS WEEKEND AT AND I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE ALLERGIST INSTEAD IT IS MUCH LESS COMPLICATED AND MUCH MORE INTUITIVE I PLAY A TON OF HEAVY GAMES AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO PERFORM EACH BASIC ACTION CORRECTLY WITHOUT SOME ASSISTANCE THE ICONOGRAPHY DOESN'T REALLY HELP EITHER
FOR THE PAST MONTHS I'VE REALLY BEEN LEANING TOWARDS HEAVY GAMES AND THE ALLERGIST WAS ONE THAT REALLY ATTRACTED ME

I DON'T KNOW LISBOA S RULES THE ALLERGIST IS ALMOST TOO PROCEDURAL FOR MY TASTES EVERY ACTION OF THE FEW YOU HAVE AVAILABLE IS FOLLOWED BY A SERIES OF STEPS THAT CAN GET IN THE WAY WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO HAVE FUN

THAT SAID IT HAS THE BEST PLAYER AID I'VE EVER SEEN AND THINGS AT THE END OF MY FIRST GAME BECAME A LITTLE MORE SMOOTH

LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAY IT AGAIN THIS WEEKEND BECAUSE THE DESIGN IS GREAT
SO MUCH DESIGNER HYPE THESE DAYS IT'S FROM XXX SO MUST GET IT AND THESE GUYS KEEP PUMPING EM OUT AT A STUPIDLY FAST RATE THE NEW FELD THE NEW ROSENBERG THE NEW PFISTER THE NEW LACERNA

IS IT ME OR THIS DESIGNER HYPING JUST SILLY
PICTOMANIA IS A GOOD ONE
CELESTIA

I THINK THIS GAME WOULD FIT ALL OF THOSE GAMES AS WELL AND DOESN'T BREAK THE BANK EITHER
FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY AREN'T INTO BOARD GAMES THE TIMELINE AND CARDLIKE SERIES OF GAMES ARE REALLY SIMPLE TRIVIA GAMES
TELESTRATIONS

CASH N GUNS
CONCEPT

WITS AND WAGERS

GUILLOTINE
PICTOMANIA AND DIAMANT THE LAST ONE IS AND CAN BE PLAYED BY YEAR OLDS
BIBLIOG HEY THATS MY FISH CAMEL UP PANDEMIC THE CURE SPLENDOR KING OF TOKYO GARBAGE DAY FORBIDDEN DESERT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
PLAYER IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FUN CONSIDER HAVING MORE CHILDREN
BG HAS THE AGE AT THE BG COMMUNITY HAS IT AT

THIS MAKES SENSE TO ME SOME OF THE ROLES CAN GET QUITE COMPLEX I'M SURE IF YOU HAVE A BRIGHT KID AND YOU MANAGE WHICH ROLES ARE AVAILABLE YOU COULD WALK A YOUNGER KID THROUGH A GAME

I HAVE 2 AT AND BOTH VERY SMART HIGHLY SOCIABLE KIDS WHO LIKE GAMES COSMIC ENCOUNTER IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES AND I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY WITH THEM BUT AS IT STANDS

TOO MUCH READING THE GAME WOULD TAKE HOURS

TOO MUCH NUANCE THEY'D GET STOMPED ON ACCIDENT FORGETTING THEY HAVE A CERTAIN CARD IN THEIR HAND

TOO MUCH DECEPTION THEY CAN BLUFF AND WHATNOT SOME BUT THEY ARE SO POOR AT LYING AND BRAVADO THAT PART OF THE GAME IS GONE

TOO MUCH INTERACTION YOU'D BE COACHING EVERY MINUTE OF THE GAME

I'D SAY THE MINIMUM AGE WOULD AVERAGE OUT AT ABOUT TO MAKE IT A FAIR FIGHT THOUGH EVERY KID IS DIFFERENT SOME WILL BE BARELY READY AT OTHERS WILL BE BARELY READY AT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE I'D SUGGEST

MY FIRST BONANZA THIS HAS ALL THE ALL THE TIME THE ORIGINAL GAME IS THE SAME AS THIS ONE BUT THE NUMBERS VALUES ARE LARGER AND THE THEME'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THIS IS BY NO MEANS A KID VERSION IT'S THE SAME GAME BUT HAS PLAYER MATS I HATE KID VERSIONS AND I HAVE THIS GAME

CATAN LIKE REGULAR CATAN THEY CAN HANDLE IT

KING OF TOKYO ARENA OF THE PLANESWALKERS THESE WILL BE GOOD IF WHAT THEY WANT IS MULTIPLAYER COMBAT WHICH IS THE ONE THING THE TWO ABOVE CAN'T PROVIDE
I STARTED PLAYING CE AT AND THIS WAS PRETTY MUCH MY FIRST REAL BOARD GAME THIS WAS WITH THE EON EDITION BACK IN SO IT WAS A LOT LESS COMPLEX THAN IT IS NOW NO FLARES ONLY ALIEN POWERS ETC

I THINK YOU COULD DO IT BY BORROWING CONCEPTS FROM THAT ORIGINAL EDITION

REMOVE THE FLARES JUST DON'T PLAY WITH THEM AT ALL
GO THROUGH THE ALIENS AND KEEP ONLY SIMPLE ONES NOT NECESSARILY BY COLOUR BUT BY THEIR INTERACTION I WOULD SUGGEST LOOKING AT THE ORIGINAL LIST FROM THE EON GAME THEY WORKED GREAT AND MOST OF THEM ARE STILL IN THE FFA VERSION
REMOVE THE WILD AND SPECIAL CARDS FROM THE DESTINY DECK
REMOVE THE REINFORCEMENT CARDS FROM THE ENCOUNTER DECK

PLAY THIS WAY START OF SLOW WITHOUT TOO STRICT ADHERENCE TO THE TURN ORDER AND THEN EXPAND THE NUMBER OF ALIENS IN THE GAME YOU GET FREE EACH TIME YOU DO THIS ADD NEW FEATURES NOW WE HAVE ETC AND MOVE ON FROM THERE

I AM SURE YOU CAN FIND THE ORIGINAL EON RULES ONLINE SOMEWHERE WHICH WERE MUCH SIMPLER AND GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THE GAME WAS LIKE BACK THEN WHEN IT PLAYED GREAT PLAYER AND WAS GREAT FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS AT
I'VE PLAYED COSMIC ENCOUNTER WITH A YEAR-OLD WHO ALSO MADE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH A DESCENT CAMPAIGN HE WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE RULES OF COSMIC ENCOUNTER JUST FINE BUT THE STRATEGY WAS HARD FOR HIM TO GRASP HE WASN'T SURE WHEN TO TEAM UP AND WITH WHOM HE BASICALLY HANDED HIS MOM THE GAME BECAUSE HE DID WHATEVER SHE TOLD HIM TO AND WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ANYONE ADVICE
IN MY EXPERIENCE AND ARE RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF LEARNING BLUFFING AND NEGOTIATIONS IN GAMES

THEY'RE RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF BEING ABLE TO PUT THEMSELVES IN SOMEONE SHOES AND SEE THINGS FROM THE OTHER POINT OF VIEW

COSMIC ENCOUNTER MIGHT BE A BUT MUCH BUT BONANZA FOR NEGOTIATING OR COCKROACH POKER FOR BLUFFING MIGHT WORK THEY'RE GOING TO BE BAD AT IT BUT IF THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S OK DURING GAME TIME TO PLAY WITH THE PARENTS AS EQUALS AND NEGOTIATE AND BLUFF AND WHATNOT I THINK IT'S OKAY

WHEN I PLAYED CRANIUM WITH MY DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS FIVE SHE HAPPILY REPORTED THAT SHE TOTALLY WON WHEN HER MOM GOT HOME SHE WAS ABLE TO GUESS ALL MY DRAWINGS I COULDN'T GUESS ANY OF HERS SAME WITH THE SIGNING AND THE CHARADE IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE BUT IT WAS A REALLY FUNNY AFTERNOON

THE WORST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO ACCELERATE THE LEARNING CURVE OF GAMING TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S NOT FUN FOR YOUR WIFE OR CHILD I'M GUESSING YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOU'LL BE EXCITED TO LEARN AND PLAYING ANYTHING NOT MATTER HOW COMPLEX BUT THEY MAY NOT BE AS EXCITED OR READY

ANYWAY I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK
RACE FOR THE GALAXY
CHICAGO EXPRESS SHOULD DEFINITELY BE CONSIDERED
HANSA TEUTONIA ONCE EVERYONE KNOWS THE RULES GAMES WITH TAKE ABOUT AN HOUR AND CAN FINISH EVEN BEFORE THAT HIGH ON PLAYER INTERACTION EACH TURN COMES AROUND PRETTY FAST
SO FOR ME FILLER AND CHALLENGING DOESN'T MIX

IN GENERAL FOR A CHALLENGING BUT RELATIVELY SHORT GAME I WOULD SAY GLASS ROAD IT'S A NICE SHORT EURO THAT'S RELATIVELY HEAVY FOR THE LENGTH

KINGDOM BUILDER IS ANOTHER OPTION LIGHTER BUT PLAYS QUICKLY MOSTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THE DECISIONS IN THE GAME ARE MADE BY WHAT CARDS YOU DRAW

HARBOUR IS A TINY SMALLBOY WORKER PLACEMENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT GAME THAT YOU CAN PLAY IN AN HOUR I HIGHLY SUGGEST IT

BETWEEN TWO CITIES IS ANOTHER EXCELLENT SUGGESTION EVERY GROUP NEEDS A COPY IT PLAYS FROM TWO PLAYER IS UNOFFICIAL BUT YOU CAN PROBABLY GUESS THE RULES BY READING THE BOOK IT'S A DRAFTING GAME SO IT SCALES WELL AND YOU MAKE INTERESTING DECISIONS THROUGHOUT IT'S SURPRISINGLY DEEP IF YOU'RE A AND SETUP TEACHING TIME IS RELATIVELY SHORT IT'S ALSO GREAT WHEN YOU HAVE VARIED SKILL LEVELS DEALS A LITTLE BIT WITH THE ISSUE OF QUARTERBACKING

SPLENDOR OF COURSE IT MAY BE TOO LIGHT FOR YOU I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF SPLENDOR BUT IT'S NOT A BAD GAME TO PULL OUT IN THESE SITUATIONS

MEDIEVAL ACADEMY IS A DRAFTING GAME THAT'S RELATIVELY LIGHT BUT ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE INTERESTING DECISIONS THROUGHOUT

IMHOTEP IS ANOTHER GAME THAT I THINK WORKS WELL FOR THE TIME YOU EXPRESSED I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY PLAYED IT BUT THE FRIEND WHO TAUGHT ME MY FIRST BOARD GAMES USES IMHOTEP FOR THIS EXACT SITUATION SO I CAN'T SAY AS MUCH ABOUT HOW IT PLAYS BUT HE HAS EXCELLENT TASTE AND IT'S AN AWARD WINNING GAME

MEDICI THIS IS A BIDDING GAME WITH SURPRISING DEPTH

U GETINFO
IN ADDITION TO ISLE OF SKYE AND CHICAGO EXPRESS I'D SUGGEST PELEPONNES ALL EXCEPTIONALLY DEEP FOR THEIR PLAY LENGTH ESPECIALLY THE LATTER TWO
I GUESS HEAVIER IS SUBJECTIVE BASED ON YOUR CALIBRATION MAYBE SOME OF THESE WOULD WORK

ARBORETUM

GLASS ROAD ISLE OF SKYE AND CARCASSONNE ALL COME IN AT LESS THAN ONE HOUR GLASS ROAD DEFINITELY HAS A HEAVIER EURO FEEL TO IT

I RECENTLY PICKED UP COAL BARON THE BIG CARD GAME AND WAS QUITE IMPRESSED WITH HOW MUCH IT SQUEEZES INTO A SMALL BOX AND SMALL TIME SLOT
LOOK AT CARL GAMES
PARIS CONNECTION ALSO KNOWN AS SNCF FALLS INTO THE CHINKY FILLER CATEGORY SETUP TIME IS A LITTLE ON THE LONG SIDE BUT THE GAMEPLAY IS QUICK AND EASY WITH PLENTY TO THINK ABOUT
ISLE OF SKYE IT PROVIDES MORE INTERESTING DECISIONS IN MINUTES THAN MANY GAMES IN TWO HOURS PARTICULARLY IN HOW TO PRICE THE TILES YOU DRAW
MY VOTE GOES TO THE PALACES OF CARRARA ITS MID EURO THAT CAN BE PLAYED UNDER AN HOUR YOU DON'T NEED ENGLISH VERSION AS IT IS OUT OF PRINT IM SURE AS GAME IS LANGUAGE INDEPENDENT EXCEPT FOR FINAL GOAL CARDS WHICH STAND ON THE ABL TO MARK WHEN GAMES COULD END AND FOR THAT THERE IS TRANSLATION ON BG EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE ICONS AS WELL
I CAN THINK OF ARBORETUM AND THE GAMES FROM THE TINY EPIC SERIES
DAYS SORRY GLANCED PASSED THE PLAYER COUNT REQUIREMENT

TINY EPIC GALAXY WESTERN

MYSTIC VALE INTERESTING CARD CRAFTING MECHANIC

CONDOTTIERE AREA CONTROL GAME WITH SIMPLE MECHANICS CHECK OUT MUSD REVIEW KIND OF HARD TO FIND

AWESOME RESPONSES ALL VIRTUALLY NONE OF THOSE WERE ON MY RADAR SO I'VE GOT LOTS OF RESEARCH TO DO

YES HEAVY DEEP IS VERY SUBJECTIVE SO MANY OF THE FILLER GAMES ARE PARTY GAMES AND I LIKE THOSE TOO BUT I'M TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS LIKE THE EXPERIENCE WHEN I PLAY CAVERN OR ECLIPSE OR SCYTHE ETC BUT IN A MORE BITE SIZED PACKAGE I SUPPOSE THE BIG CHALLENGE IS THAT IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SPEND AN HOUR ON THE RULES TO PLAY FOR BUT HEY PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

OUT OF THE STUFF LISTED I'VE GOT AND LIKE ROLL FOR THE GALAXY AND SPLENDOR A LITTLE LIGHT BUT I LIKE IT I'VE GOT A OR SO GAME COLLECTION AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN MY GAME GROUP THAT HAVE MANY MORE THAN ME SO IT'S FUNNY SO MANY OF THESE ARE NEW TO ME

AWESOME ADVICE ALL CHEERS
IT WASN'T RELIC


I GOT THE CHANCE TO PLAY THIS OVER THE WEEKEND IT'S A REALLY SOLID GAME AND LIKE YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A BIG BOX BATHALA GAME TAKES QUITE A BIT OF THOUGHT TO PULL OFF A GOOD TURN

SHARED ROUTE BUILDING USING COLORED BOATS TO SURROUND ISLANDS IS THE GAMES CORE CONCEPT THE OTHER IS A PLAYER ROLE DRAFT AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH TURN ROLE GIVES YOU SOME BOATS A UNIQUE ABILITY AND ALSO SETS TURN ORDER

ONLY MAJOR LIMITATION ON YOUR TURN IS THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPAND THE BOAT NETWORK BY BUILDING OFF AN EXISTING BOAT OF MATCHING COLOR IF YOU END TURN WITH BOATS SURROUNDING AN EMPTY ISLAND AND THE COLORS MATCH THE COLORS OF A BUILDING AVAILABLE VIA A TILE MARKET BUILD IT AND GET BIG VP THERE'S A FEW OTHER LITTLE THINGS GOING ON BUT THAT IS THE GIST

WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME WITH IT PLAYED IN AN HOUR FLAT FROM TALKING WITH BRUNO GAMES OFTEN END WITH ONE PLAYER BUILDING ALL OF THEIR BUILDINGS BUT WE WERE PRETTY CUTTHROAT AND BLOCKED EACH OTHER A BIT FORCING THE NETWORK OF BOATS TO KEEP EXPANDING EVENTUALLY THIS TRIGGERED AN ENDGAME WHERE WE RAN OUT OF ONE COLOR OF BOATS
NOT ALWAYS A FAN OF DOW BUT ALWAYS A FAN OF BRUNO BATHALA LOOKING FORWARD TO GIVING THIS ONE A GO

THE BOARD LOOKS A BIT UGLY IN MY OPINION LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MADE IN WORD BUT ALL THE OTHER ART IS NICE LIKE FIVE TRIBES
I DO LOVE THE PRODUCTION QUALITY OF DAYS OF WONDER GAMES
I WANT IT
AS SOMEONE WHO PLAYS FIVE TRIBES ALMOST RELIGIOUSLY THIS IS VERY EXCITING
ANY RELEASE DATE IN ALL THAT INFO
I'M INTRIGUED I ALSO THINK THE BOARD LOOKS RATHER DULL I GUESS I'D PREFER THAT OVER BUSY AND GARISH BUT STILL THE THEME DOESN'T QUITE COME THROUGH IN THE ARTICLE THEN AGAIN THIS MIGHT BE A PROTOTYPE
DID A DOUBLE TAKE TO CHECK IF IT'S A CENTAI GAME
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT GALAXY DEFENDERS WAS BASICALLY AN GAME IT'S A MINIATURES CO-OP GAME WITH A GOOD CAMPAIGN THERE'S ALSO A STARSHIP TROOPER FEEL TO THE GAME AND MY SONS AND I HAVE GREATLY ENJOYED THE BASE GAME AND IT'S EXPANSIONS
I'M SURE SOMEONE ASKED SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE AND I BELIEVE LEVEL OMEGA PROTOCOL WAS ONE OF THE ANSWERS THAT CROPPED UP

U GETINFO
I WOULD SAY STAR WARS FEELS SIMILAR TO THE VIDEO GAME
IGNORING THE GEOSCAPE ASPECT OF BCOM EARTH REBORN REALLY EMULATES THE TACTICAL COMBAT
HONESTLY GALAXY DEFENDERS REALLY WAS WHAT BCOM SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRY THAT OUT
THIS MAY BE LOOKED DOWN UPON BUT BLOOD BOWL

THIS IS A COOL SQUAD TEAM BASED TACTICAL BOARD GAME IN TURNS AND DICE YES IT IS A BIT GOOFY AND IT ISN'T REALLY SERIOUS BUT IT COULD TOTALLY SCRATCH THAT ITCH
LEVEL OMEGA PROTOCOL AND EARTH REBORN ARE THE CLOSEST BOTH OFFER EXCELLENT TACTICAL BATTLES

ANOTHER ONE IS NIGHT OF MAN WHICH IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BEING A WARGAME WITH A SCI-FI SKIN
NOT A WAR GAME BUT ERIC THE OTHERS IS GREAT FUN AND FEELS TO ME LIKE MISSIONS THERE'S NO CAMPAIGN OR TECH ADVANCEMENT BUT THE BACK AND FORTH IS REALLY GOOD

THE GAME IS A TEAM THAT CAN DEPLOY OR UNIQUE UNITS OUT OF AT A TIME AND ARE FACING OFF AGAINST A SET OF OBJECTIVES AND A BUNCH OF MONSTROUS CORRUPTED HUMANS AND MONSTROUS OTHERS

IT'S GOT PUSH YOUR LUCK MECHANICS ASYMMETRICAL DICE WITH EXPLODING ROLL ANOTHER CRITICAL RESULTS TO DATE ALMOST EVERY GAME HAS BEEN A ROLLERCOASTER OF ALTERNATING WHICH SIDE IS LOOKING TO WIN ALL THE WAY TO THE END
THIS IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST THING

VIDEOS
THOUGH NOT SPACE SCIFI THEMED KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER IS VERY MUCH AN TYPE GAME IT ALSO HAS A HEFTY PRICE TAG IF YOU CAN EVEN FIND IT A NEW KICKSTARTER BEGINS ON BLACK FRIDAY AND MIGHT BE THE ONLY CHANCE TO GET THE GAME AT A REASONABLE PRICE

IT HAS A GROUP OF SURVIVORS YOUR SOLDIERS LANTERN YEAR ENCOUNTERS MISSIONS A SET OF MONSTERS TO FIGHT THE DIFFERENT ALIEN TYPES SETTLEMENT PHASE WHERE YOU RESEARCH NEW ITEMS AND BUILD NEW ARMOR WEAPONS FROM WHAT YOU GOT FROM THE MISSION AND YOUR SURVIVORS WILL DIE HORRIBLY JUST LIKE THEY DO IN

PEOPLE BALK AT THE HIGH PRICE BUT THERE IS A SERIOUS AMOUNT OF CONTENT IN THE GAME AND THERE IS HIGH REPLACEABILITY
INSANITY CONDITIONS ARE AN INTERESTING TAKE ON THE POTENTIAL TRAITOR MECHANIC IN MANY CO-OP GAMES IT IS USUALLY IMPLEMENTED TO GIVE A PLAYER MORE AUTONOMY AIH RESPECT TO MORE DOMINANT PLAYER'S INSTRUCTIONS IT CAN BE A NICE CHANGE OF PACE TO JUST DO YOUR OWN THING WHILE FULLY IGNORING WHAT YOUR FELLOW PLAYERS SAY

THAT SAID IT'S A MATTER OF PERSONAL TASTE WETHER YOU FIND THE SPECIFIC INSANITY CONDITIONS FUN IF YOU DON'T CHECK OUT SOME PLAYER MADE ALTERNATIVES OVER AT BOARD GAME GEEK
THE IDEA IS THAT YOUR BREAK IN SANITY CREATES A DIFFERENT MOTIVATION FOR YOU YOU NO LONGER CARE ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION BUT WHATEVER YOUR FOCUS IS NOW
I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH THEM THE PYRO ONE'S COME UP THREE TIMES FOR US AND TWICE IT JUST INSTANTLY ENDED THE GAME WHILE THE THIRD TIME IT WAS SO LATE IN THE GAME THAT THE PLAYER HAD EFFECTIVELY NO CHANCE OF EVER WINNING AND IT WAS ALSO DUE TO UNAVOIDABLE HORROR IN THE 4TH SCENARIO SO IT FELT LIKE A PARTICULARLY CHEAP SHOT
WHEN I PLAY 2 PLAYER WITH MY F WE TYPICALLY IGNORE INSANITY EFFECTS
DID YOU CONFIRM THAT BOTH OF YOUR INSANITIES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE DECK AT 2 PLAYERS I THINK THERE'S A THINGY ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT THAT TELLS YOU WHAT PLAYER COUNTS THE INSANITY APPLIES TO

I SUSPECT THAT LOW PLAYER COUNTS REMOVE SOME OF THE TRAITOR STYLE ONES IN FAVOR OF THE WEIRD SIDE QUEST STYLE BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PRESERVE THE SURPRISE AND AVOIDED LOOKING AT ALL THE BACKS
PHIL GAMES ARE A MIX BETWEEN THE TWO
LEAVING EARTH

U GETINFO

EVOLUTION CLIMATE SEEMS TO FIT ON THE PLUS SIDE IT IS AN AWESOME GAME
ROBORALLY TEACHES THE FUNDAMENTAL OF PROGRAMMING ROBOT TURTLES IS ROBORALLY FOR YOUNGER KIDS
THE COIN GAMES FROM GMT ARE EXCELLENT MODELS OF ASYMMETRIC HISTORICAL CONFLICTS SPECIFICALLY INSURGENCIES MY FAVORITE IS FALLING SKY SET IN ANCIENT GAUL BUT MOST OF THE SERIES IS SET AFTER ALL OF THEM DO AN EXCELLENT JOB OF CAPTURING THE DIFFERENT FEEL OF FOUR FACTIONS WITH DIFFERENT IDENTITIES AND GOALS AND THE CARD DECKS PROVIDE A HUGE SELECTION OF REAL HISTORICAL EVENTS TO PLAY THROUGH WITH A PARAGRAPH OR MORE OF EXPLANATORY FLAVOR TEXT FOR EACH ONE IN THE PLAYBOOK
IF YOU LIKE THE SPACE THEME LEAVING EARTH IS MY CURRENT FAVE LESS INTENSE THAN AN EKLUND WHILE CAPTURING THE FEEL OF THE SPACE RACE PROBABLY MY FAVORITE SOLO PLAY EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW
THE TIMELINE SERIES

PROBABLY MORE GAME THAN SIM BUT IT HAS MORE SIM THAN MOST BOARD GAMES I'VE PLAYED

ARCHIPELAGO SUPPLY DEMAND ON LOCAL AND FOREIGN MARKETS AFFECTS UNEMPLOYMENT AND CIVIL UNREST THE GAME ACHIEVES A PRETTY NEAT BALANCE HERE AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY PLAYER ACTION HAS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT EFFECT ON THESE SYSTEMS DESPITE THESE SYSTEMS OFTEN NOT BEING THE FOCUS OF WHAT THE PLAYER IS TRYING TO DO VERY COOL STUFF
IT'S DEFINITELY MORE GAME THAN SIMULATION BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT POWER GRID DOES A NEAT JOB OF SIMULATING SUPPLY AND DEMAND
CAMPAIGN FOR NORTH AFRICA IS A REAL TIME WAR SIMULATION BOARDGAME
TWO HEAVIER GAMES THAT AREN'T REALLY EDUCATIONAL BUT THAT DO PROVIDE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR EDUCATIONAL DISCUSSION THROUGH THE AGES AND TERRAFORMING MARS BOTH HAVE A PLETHORA OF HISTORICALLY CTA OR SCIENTIFICALLY TM ACCURATE CARDS REPRESENTING TECHNOLOGIES DISCOVERIES HISTORICAL FIGURES SCIENTIFIC PROCESSES ETC NEITHER ONE GIVES YOU MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT THEM BUT THEY'RE WELL INTEGRATED THEMATICALLY INTO THE GAME AND COULD PROVIDE EXCELLENT TALKING POINTS
DON'T WORRY PLAY WHAT YOU HAVE TO THE POINT WHERE THE TEXT ON THE CARDS AREN'T LEGIBLE ANYMORE AND THE BOARD HAS SPLIT INTO THREE PIECES

YOU'LL HAVE HAD YOUR FILL OF THOSE GAMES BY THEN BOARDGAMES ARE A LUXURY AND THE KALLAXES YOU SEE ON THE CMC POSTS ARE NOT NORMAL THEY ARE OUR HOBBY'S WHALES WHO HAVE REACHED THE POINT IN LIFE WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD IT

HERE IN THE UK IT'S SIMILAR BIG BOX GAMES THAT USED TO AROUND THE ARP NOW HAVE AN ARP OF MORE THAN A WEEKS SHOPPING FOR MY FAMILY THEY HAVE TRULY ENTERED THE LUXURY END OF THE MARKET

I COULD END IT THERE BUT I HAVE AROUND GAMES THAT I CAN PLAY SO I DON'T HAVE A FEAST FOR ODIN BUT I DO HAVE SO I PLAY THAT INSTEAD I'D LOVE EL GRANDE BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT SO I PLAY THE LESSER KNOWN GAME HAN INSTEAD

I CAN'T COMMENT ON YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION BUT BOARD GAMES SHOULD BE LAST IN YOUR BUDGET PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING
I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU GET SOME DIVERSE RESPONSES I'M NOT CERTAIN IF THIS SUB WILL HAVE THE BEST ANSWERS SINCE I KNOW THAT THE SUB CAN SKEW TOWARDS CERTAIN COUNTRIES ALTHOUGH I'M CERTAIN THAT AUSTRALIANS CAN COMMISERATE ON COST ISSUES

I WOULDN'T SAY JUST GIVE UP ON THE HOBBY IF YOU ENJOY IT THERE'S A FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD DO

LOOK INTO METUMPS I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE SCENE IS LIKE IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR BOARD GAMES YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE SO THAT YOU CAN COMBINE COLLECTIONS WHILE PLAYING TOGETHER OR MAKE JOINT INVESTMENTS FOR EXAMPLE BUYING PANDEMIC LEGACY TOGETHER SPLITTING THE COST YOU MAY FIND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERJOYED TO PLAY THE GAMES IN YOUR COLLECTION AND WHO HAVE GAMES THAT YOU'VE DREAMED OF PLAYING

PRINT AND PLAY GAMES I'M ON MOBILE SO LINKING TO A LIST WILL BE HARD THERE ARE TONS OF GAMES THAT CAN BE PNP SECRET HITLER HEAT ETC YOU COULD ALSO TRY CHECKING WITH SOME OF THE MAJOR GAME COMPANIES WHETHER THEY HAVE GAMES NEEDING PLAYTESTERS NOTE THAT SOMETIMES PNP GAMES CAN COST AS MUCH OR MORE TO MAKE THE GAME THAN BUYING A NEW GAME BUT IF YOU GET SOME GENERIC CUBES DICE ETC THEN YOU CAN OFTEN REUSE ITEMS BETWEEN VARIOUS GAMES I HAVE HAD FRIENDS WHO MADE THEIR OWN COPIES OF MEDICI AND SPYFAULT AS WELL
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET NEW BOARD GAMES DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD QUIT THERE'S A LOT OF SATISFACTION TO BE FOUND BY MASTERING A GAME JUST MAKE SURE YOU MIX IT UP AS MUCH AS YOU CAN ON TOP OF THAT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO OWNS BOARD GAMES FIND MORE PEOPLE TO PLAY BOARD GAMES WITH AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU YOU'LL ALSO FIND MORE BOARD GAMES

ALSO IF THERE'S A GAME YOU FEEL YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE YOU CAN ASK EVERYONE IN THE GROUP TO PITCH IN TO BUY IT THE ONLY ISSUE IS FIGURING OUT WHO GETS TO KEEP THE GAME

BEST OF LUCK
YOU CAN PLAY ONLINE IN AND BOARDGAME ARENA IN ADDITION TABLETOPIA WILL BE RELEASED SOON
TRY TABLETOP SIMULATOR I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN DO PASS AND PLAY ON IT BUT THEY HAVE LAYOUTS FOR BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL CATAN ETC ETC THINK ABOUT GRABBING IT IN THE STEAM CHRISTMAS SALE
ECHOING A COUPLE OF THE COMMENTS BUT JUST REMEMBER THE TRUE COMPETITION ASPECT OF BOARDGAMING IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PLAY OF THE GAME ITSELF NOT KEEPING UP WITH THE SIZE OF EVERYONE COLLECTION I GUESS IT IS LIKE THAT WITH MOST THINGS WHICH INVOLVE A COLLECTION ASPECT BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO SEE PEOPLE POSTING PICTURES OF THEIR GIANT COLLECTIONS AND TALKING ABOUT OWING EVERY NEW AND COOL GAME EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT AND THE MAIN THING IS THAT WHATEVER YOU DO GAMING CARS CIGARS PORCELAIN DOLLS OR WHATEVER DO IT WITHIN YOUR MEANS BUDGET AND ALLOCATE A COMFORTABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT TO YOUR HOBBIES FIND GROUPS WHERE YOU AREN'T PRESSURED TO BE THE SOLE SOURCE OF NEW GAMES PLAY WHAT YOU OWN AND GET YOUR VALUE OUT OF IT LOOK FOR QUALITY IN THE FACE OF A HOBBY GONE MAD WITH QUANTITY
BOARD GAMES TO GO FACEBOOK GROUP LOTS OF PEOPLE SELLING 2ND HAND GAMES ON THE CHEAP SELL OFF YOUR OLD GAMES TO AFFORD NEW ONES

BOARD GAME CAFES ALL ABOARD COMMUNITY GAMING CENTER AND MEEDLESS CAFE GET YOUR BOARD GAMING FIX WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY A WHOLE GAME

ARRANGE METUMPS WITH PEOPLE LIKE ME SO YOU CAN PLAY OTHER GAMES WITHOUT COMMITTING TO FINANCIAL INVESTMENT

GOOD LUCK THE RINGGIT SUCKS THANKS NAJIB YOU FUCKER BUT IT'S POSSIBLE
THERE ARE A FEW LISTS THAT LIST THIS SAME ONE I DEFINITELY SAW A BETTER ONE THAN THE ONE I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY A BUNCH OF GAMES THAT CAN BE USED TO ALSO PLAY OTHER GAMES SO IF YOU IGNORE THE ARTWORK YOU KIND OF ARE GETTING A 2 FOR DEAL AND AT TIMES EVEN MORE

BUT CHECK OUT THIS LIST OF GAMES THAT ALSO CAN BE PLAYED AS OTHER GAMES AND BE SURE TO LOOK AND DIG DEEPER INTO BG TO FIND OTHER LISTS LIKE THIS ONE
WOW THANKS PEOPLE IT'S A START BOARD GAMES ARE BECOMING A LUXURY I USED TO BE THE ONE OWNING THE BOARD GAMES BUT SOLD THEM OFF NOW NO ONE IS BUYING

BUT GREAT SUGGESTIONS I MEAN EVEN IF IT IS CATAN IT'S STILL FUN IF PLAYED ONCE IN AWHILE

I WAS THINKING OF ORGANIZING A GROUP TO JUST SHARE GAMES AROUND AND MEET UP TO PLAY PROBLEM IS HAVE TO MANAGE CAREFULLY CAUSE THERE ARE CASUAL MEDIUM AND HARDCORE GAMERS

I ALSO GOT ONTO LOAR CG TO PLAY SOLO GOT IT CHEAP OFF THE MARKET LUCKY ME
HAVE YOU EXPLORED RPG GAMES LIKE DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS PATHFINDER OR FATE ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR CORE SET OF RULE BOOKS YOU CAN EXPAND INDEFINITELY LIMITED ONLY BY YOUR IMAGINATION PATHFINDER AND FATE ARE REALLY REASONABLE FOR THE DIGITAL EDITIONS ALSO THERE ARE SEVERAL PODCASTS OF PEOPLE PLAYING THESE GAMES THAT YOU CAN USE FOR INSPIRATION FOR YOUR OWN GAMES
WELL I WOULD SAY PLAY WHAT YOU HAVE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN
THEN SAFE JUST A BIT OF MONEY EVERY MONTH AND THEN ONCE EVERY TO MONTHS BUT YOURSELF ONE
IT IS ALL ABOUT LIFE ADMIN MATE THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO KEEP THAT HUNGER FOR MORE AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE
SAME THINGS STARTED HAPPENING TO ME AND GAMES ARE RELATIVELY CHEAP HERE I HAD TO CUT BACK ON GETTING NEW GAMES AND AM VERY SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT I GET NOW
IF YOU GUYS KNOW OF ANY CHEAPER WAY TO GET GAMES TO WHERE I AM IN MALAYSIA WITHOUT SHIPPING COST KILLING ME

PAGING U SIGMA
PLAY WHAT YOU GOT THERE'S NO NEED TO BE PERPETUALLY BUYING GAMES ONLY BUY SOMETHING WHEN IT FITS INTO YOUR BUDGET AND YOU WANT IT AND YOU NEED A BREAK FROM WHAT YOU HAVE
LOOK AROUND FOR GAMING GROUPS IF YOU CAN SHOW UP FOR A GAMING GROUP WITH A COLLECTION THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO EVER BUY A GAME
ONLINE BOARD GAME ARENA IS A NICELY DESIGNED SITE FOR ONLINE PLAY AND THEY HAVE A NICE SELECTION OF GAMES ALL FREE THOUGH YOU CAN PAY FOR A MEMBERSHIP
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT TO QUIT KEEP PLAYING THE GAMES YOU OWN IT WON'T COST YOU A PENNY TO CONTINUE IN THIS HOBBY

AND EVEN IF YOU WERE NOT HAVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES I WOULD ARGUE THIS IS THE CHEAPEST HOBBY TO HAVE BECAUSE ITS SO EASY TO BE A FREELOADER WHAT THIS HOBBY IS MISSING IS NOT GAMES BUT PLAYERS SHOW UP AT ANY LOCAL GAME CLUB AND YOU WILL SEE GAMERS WILL STACKS OF UNPLAYED GAMES THEY JUST WANT TO GET THEM PLAYED

SO EITHER KEEP PLAYING YOUR GAMES TRADE THEM IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM ANYMORE OR FIND OTHER GAMERS AND PLAY THEIR COPIES
WONDER HOW MANY MALAYSIAN TABLETOP PLAYERS ARE LURKING HERE WE SHOULD HOLD A MEET UP TO PLAY SOME GAMES ONE DAY

I DEFINITELY FEEL THE GAMES ARE GETTING MORE PRICIER AND PRICIER DUE TO OUR DEVALUING CURRENCY AT THIS MOMENT IT'S ALMOST RM TO USD ALL THE GAMES DON'T LOOK QUITE AS CHEAP A MONTH AGO AS A MALAYSIAN GAMER WE REALLY TO DO SOME VERY SMART SHOPPING AROUND I'LL SHARE SOME TIPS WITH YOU

IF YOU FOUND A GAME THAT YOU'RE VERY INTERESTED IN AND IT HAPPENS TO BE PUBLISHED BY SMALL PUBLISHER OR INDEPENDENT DEVELOPERS CHECK THEIR PRICE AND BUY DIRECTLY FROM THEM FOR EXAMPLE I RECENTLY BOUGHT PAX RENAISSANCE AND BIOS GENESIS FROM SIERRA MADRE GAME THE GAME CREATOR PHIL EKLUND WAS KIND ENOUGH TO ALLOW COMBINED SHIPMENT OF EUR FOR BOTH GAMES AND I RECEIVED IT LESS THAN 2 WEEKS

2 HAVING SAID SO I FOUND BUYING FROM EUROPEAN DEALERS CHEAPER THAN LOCAL GAME STORES NOT TO MENTIONED I BUY DIRECT FROM DEVELOPERS AS WELL NOTABLE VENDORS ARE HISTOGRAM AND HEXASTIGM

LOOK OUT FOR BLACK FRIDAY SALES THANKSGIVING HALLOWEEN CHRISTMAS SALES FROM OVERSEAS SELLERS GAMES CAN GET VERY CHEAP DURING FESTIVAL SEASON AND I USUALLY BUY DURING THESE PERIODS NOTABLE EXAMPLES ARE AMAZON JUST 2 WEEKS AGO LOST CITIES WAS DISCOUNTED UP TO AND MINIATURE MARKET DAYS THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS WAS ONLY USD DURING HALLOWEEN SALES I'M FINE WITH MINIATURE MARKET AS THEIR SHIPPING RATE IS MORE COMPETITIVE COMPARED TO THE LIKES LIKE AMAZON OR COOL STUFF INC IF GAME SHIPPING ARE CHEAPER THAN LOCAL STORES MEEDLESS BOARDGAMECAFE BUY

SUPPORT PROGRAMS I LOVE GMT GAMES TWILIGHT STRUGGLE LABYRINTH COIN GAMES COMMAND COLORS ETC AND I ONLY BUY FROM THEM DURING OR YEAR END SALES AT WHICH CUSTOMERS ARE ENTITLED FOR OF DISCOUNT FOR THEIR EX STOCK GAMES

BUY SECOND GAMES FROM FACEBOOK GROUP BOARD GAMES MY IF ALL ABOVE ARE NOT APPLICABLE EXAMPLES ARE GAMES LIKE AGRICOLA LE HAVRE SPLENDOR ETC THAT HAVE TO GO THROUGH DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL AND SOLD THROUGH LOCAL STORES YOU CAN OCCASIONALLY FIND BARGAIN FOR GAMES LIKE THESE IN THE GROUP SINCE EURO GAMES ARE NOT FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING ME

ALL IN ALL I WANTED TO SUPPORT FAGS LIKE MEEDLESS OR BOARDGAMECAFE BUT THEIR PRICE IS SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND HARDLY HAVE SALES I ALSO DON'T REALLY MIND TO WAIT FOR AWHILE TO PURCHASE THE GAMES DURING SALES AND WAIT FOR THE DELIVERY TO COME I HAVE ENOUGH GAMES TO PLAY BUT I ALSO DON'T MIND EXPANDING THE LIBRARY DURING THE SALES AND WAIT FOR FEW WEEKS FOR THE GAME TO ARRIVE
TRY FINDING SOME PRINT AND PLAY GAMES YOU LIKE AND WHIP THOSE UP I PNP TINY EPIC GALAXIES AND LOVE IT ALL YOU NEED ARE REGULAR DICE AND SOME MEEDLESS
CARD GAMES ONE OR TWO DECKS OF CARDS GIVES YOU NEARLY UNLIMITED REPLAY

MY PERSONAL FAVORITE GAME IS CANASTA BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHERS
PERSONALLY I'D BE GLAD IF SOMETHING WOULD KEEP ME FROM BUYING NEW BOARD GAMES INSTEAD OF PLAYING ALL THOSE WONDERFUL PEARLS IN MY COLLECTION
I WAS ABLE TO OPEN IT UP AND PLAY ONE SCENARIO A FEW WEEKS BACK THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE ABOUT GALAXY DEFENDERS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL LOVE THAT THEY INCLUDED SOME CHARACTER PROGRESSION THROUGH A CAMPAIGN AND THE ACTUAL COMBAT SYSTEM IS PRETTY ENGAGING AS WELL

I'M NOT A FAN OF THE AMMO AND JAMMING SYSTEM COMBINED IT JUST SEEMS OVER THE TOP AND UNNECESSARY PICK ONE OR THE OTHER AND WORK THE REST OF THE GAME BALANCE AROUND THAT
I HAVE THE BASE GAME BUT HAVEN'T TRIED IT WOULD IT PLAY WELL WITH 2 IS THE GAME HARD TO LEARN
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT GAME I'VE PLAYED IT BY MYSELF AND ALSO WITH GROUPS OF FRIENDS THE CHARACTER PROGRESSION IS PRETTY FUN AND I LIKE THE OBJECTIVE BASED SCENARIOS THAT HAVE YOU CHOOSING BETWEEN FULFILLING THE OBJECTIVES AND MAKING FOR AN EASIER NEXT SCENARIOS OR RISKING IT BY PUSHING A LITTLE FURTHER TO ATTEMPT TO LEVEL A HERO
I LIKED IT A GOOD BIT I'M PRETTY FAR INTO THE CAMPAIGN ALTHOUGH DESCENT TAKES ALL MY TIME NOW THAT THE NEW APP IS OUT

MY MAIN COMPLAINT WITH GD IS IT FELT LIKE WE GOT INTO A QUAGMIRE SHOOTOUT TOO MUCH I WANTED TO MOVE AROUND MORE
I'D LOVE TO TRY IT BUT IT'S BEEN OUT OF PRINT FOR A GOOD WHILE I'D BE INTERESTED TO HEAR PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS TOO GIVEN THAT MANY MORE TACTICAL GAMES HAVE SINCE BEEN RELEASED

BLACK FLEET I SAW THE SU SD REVIEW A WHILE BACK AND IT LOOKED FUN BUT IT WAS AN EARLIER EPISODE AND STANDARDS ARE CONSTANTLY RAISING IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH ALL THESE MILD-BLOWING NEW RELEASES

MAINLY I'M HOPING IT STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN FUN AND SKILL I DON'T WANT IT TO BE TOO RANDOM SINCE MY GROUP IS FOND OF EUROS BUT WE ALSO DO NEED MORE SILLY THINGS TOO
WISH SHIPPING WAS BETTER TO CANADA OH WELL
WOULD BE NICE IF THE SHIPPING WAS NOT FUCKING DOLLARS TO CANADA
HOKKAIDO HAS SOME DECISION MAKING BUT IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED QUITE THE CHILL ZEN RIDE DON'T RIGHTFULLY KNOW HOW GOOD IT IS AT TWO THOUGH
CARCASSONNE FILLS THIS NICHE FOR US VERY SIMPLE AND RELAXING
KING OF TOKYO MOSTLY JUST DICE ROLLS AND FUN

DICE GAMES ARE USUALLY GOOD FOR THIS LIKE ZOMBIE DICE ROLL FOR THE FUTURE BACK TO THE FUTURE DICE GAME ETC


IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO HAVE A GAME THAT A IS COMPETITIVE AND B HAS SOMETHING INTRINSICALLY ENJOYABLE TO DO SUCH THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO FOCUS ON WINNING OR LOSING BUT ON ENJOYING THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE I'VE LISTED BELOW WHAT GAMES I ENJOY INTRINSICALLY AND CAN BE IF YOU WANT

LARGER GAMES

HOKKAIDO IT'S THE EPITOME OF ZEN AND I LIKE SIGHTSEEING AND BUYING THINGS COUNT POINTS AT THE END FOR LESS COMPETITION

TICKET TO RIDE I LIKE TRAINS I LIKE TRAVEL AND I LIKE TRAINS

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY I LIKE BUILDING A CIVILISATION I LIKE CUTE DICE I LIKE SPACE

JUNK ART I LIKE SHOWING OFF MY TOYS AND ARTISTIC MASTERPIECES


SMALLER GAMES

COLORETTO THE RULES ARE SO LIGHT I CAN PLAY AND CHIT CHAT AT THE SAME TIME AND I LIKE SET COLLECTION

DALE OF MERCHANTS I LIKE ANIMALS I LIKE DECKBUILDING AND I LIKE THE ARTICLE

ARCHAEOLOGY I LIKE INDIANA JONES I LIKE COLLECTING STUFF AND I LIKE TRADING

KODAMA I LIKE GROWING TREES I LIKE CARD LAYING AND I LIKE THE ARTICLE
PATCHWORK IS MY GO TO 2 PLAYER RELAXING GAME IT'S LIGHT BUT STILL HAVE MEANINGFUL DEPICTIONS TO IT IT HAS A NICE TERRIS FEEL TO IT AS WELL
VALERIA CARD KINGDOMS GET THE MOST VICTORY POINTS TO WIN HIRE CHARACTERS WITH A NUMBER ON THEM THEN ROLL TWO DIE IF THE NUMBER IS THE NUMBER OF THE CHARACTER YOU HIRED YOU GET THE REWARD LIKE A MERCHANT WOULD GIVE MONEY WHICH LETS YOU HIRE MORE WORKERS OR BUY DOMAINS WHICH GIVE VICTORY POINTS A WARRIOR WOULD GIVE STRENGTH TOKENS THAT HELP YOU KILL MONSTERS WHICH ALSO GIVE VICTORY POINTS
THE GAME IS LIGHT IT HAS A BIT OF DECISION MAKING TO MAKE IT MEANINGFUL BUT THERE'S LOTS OF DICE ROLLING EXCITEMENT AND ADDICTIVENESS CHECK OUT FINAL THOUGHTS ON THE GAME WHO NORMALLY LIKES CHINKY GAMES

CAMEL UP AND COLT EXPRESS
STEAM PARK IS PRETTY GOOD FOR THIS SORT OF THING
SO I AM PROBABLY A BIT DIFFERENT I LIKE STRATEGY GAMES HOWEVER I DO ENJOY JUST PLAYING OUT COMPETITIVE GAMES IN A LIGHT HEARTED DO WHATEVER SEEMS COOL SORT OF WAY KIDS TODAY WOULD DEFINE IT AS YOLO BUT I WOULD PREFER JUST TO SAY SWITCH OF YOUR BRAIN AND PLAY BY GUT FEEL AND INVEST IN THE RIDE RATHER THAN THE RESULT

MY GAMES WOULD BE

FIVE TRIBES THE KING OF AP GAMES FOR SOME WHO TRY TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE DON'T DO THAT IF YOU CAN LET THAT GO IT IS REALLY REWARDING TO PLAY BY FEEL IF YOU SEE A MOVE DO IT GET POINTS EVERYONE IS HAPPY

IMPERIAL SETTLERS ESPECIALLY WITH NEW AZTEC EXPANSION PLAY A CARD DO THE ACTION IF YOU JUST GO WITH THE FLOW IT IS A GREAT LITTLE GAME SURE YOU CAN ATTEMPT TO BE THE ALL CONQUERING ENGINE BUILDING MASTER BUT IT'S GREAT TO JUST STUMBLE THROUGH PLAYING THE COOLEST CARD IN YOUR HAND


PATCHWORK DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF ACTIONS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK TOO HARD AND IT'S VERY VISUALLY PLEASING
TALES OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS IS LIKE THE DEFINITIVE TAKE ME FOR A RIDE BOARD GAME THE OFFICIAL RULES WILL HAVE YOU PLAYING FOR MORE LIKE 2 HOURS BUT YOU CAN HONESTLY JUST STOP WHEN YOU BOTH FEEL LIKE YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH
FLUX IS MY FOR THIS KIND OF MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT I RECOMMEND YOU PICK YOUR FAVOURITE THEME TO ADD EVEN MORE LAUGHS ENJOYMENT
MAYBE SOMETHING THAT'S JUST FUN AND SILLY I'VE BEEN PLAYING A LOT OF LOONY QUEST LATELY AND EVERYONE HAS FOUND IT TO BE A RIOT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS DRAW LINES IT'S ONE OF THOSE DEXTERITY GAMES THAT'S JUST FUN NO BRAIN BURNING WHATSOEVER
WONDERS DUEL JAIPUR BIBLIOG AND MARGI SHOULD BE GOOD CHOICES
JUST PLAYED JIM LABYRINTH THIS WEEKEND AND IT FITS THE BILL PRETTY WELL IT'S A ROLL AND MOVE GAME WITH A BIT OF INTERESTING DECISION MAKING IT'S ALSO CO-OP WHICH I ALSO FIND MORE RELAXING THAN COMPETITIVE BONUS POINTS FOR NICE LOOKING MINIS IF EITHER OF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE MOVIE THIS GAME IS DEFINITELY MADE BY A FAN FOR FANS
HOW ABOUT ELDER SIGN
LITTLE TO NO DECISION MAKING THE GAME OF LIFE
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DIRECTION BUT I RECOMMEND BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL IT'S A GAME MY WIFE AND I CAN PLAY WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT WINNING AND JUST HAVE FUN ENJOYING THE STORY THAT'S BEING TOLD SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO ONE OF OUR GUYS AND WE JUST LAUGH ABOUT BAD THINGS KEEP HAPPENING TO THE SAME PERSON LAUGH EVEN MORE
IF YOU CAN FIND A COPY I RECOMMEND RA THE DICE GAME IT HAS ALL THE ELEMENTS OF AN EURO BUT IN SUCH A COMPACT AND SIMPLE PACKAGE IT'S SHORT GREAT FOR TWO AND YOU CAN PLAY IT WITH A VERY RELAXED MINDSET JUST THROWING THE DICE AND WATCHING WHERE THEY TAKE YOU
A FEW GAMES COME TO MIND

HOKKAIDO THE GAME OF THE PATHOLOGY ENOUGH SAID

SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE THIS IS A COOPERATIVE GAME THAT I ENJOY PLAYING WITH MY BEST FRIEND WHEN HE AND I NEED SOME TIME TO JUST CHILL OUT VERY THEMATIC SUPERHEROES INITIALLY IT TAKES A BIT OF GETTING USED TO BUT AS YOU GET TO KNOW THE VARIOUS VILLAINS HEROES IT GETS EASIER TO FIGHT THEM AND WIN THE GAME

PANDEMIC THERE ARE SOME INTERESTING DECISIONS TO BE MADE BUT IN THE BASE GAME GENERALLY THE NUMBER OF DECISIONS TO BE MADE ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE WE HAVE THREE BAD THINGS HAPPENING AND AT SOME POINT WE'D LIKE TO TRADE OFF THIS CARD IN ORDER TO TRY TO CURE A DISEASE ALSO LEARNING PANDEMIC WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO PREPARE FOR PANDEMIC LEGACY IF YOU EVER WANT TO DO THAT SPOILER IT'S AMAZING AND YOU SHOULD DO SO

DEEP SEA ADVENTURE I'VE NEVER TAUGHT DEEP SEA ADVENTURE TO SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T LIKE IT IT'S A LIGHT LITTLE PUSH YOUR LUCK GAME ABOUT DIVING DOWN TO COLLECT TREASURE THERE ARE FEW DECISIONS TO ACTUALLY MAKE AND NOTHING THAT TAKES MORE THAN A SECOND TO DECIDE THIS IS BEST IN LARGE GROUPS BUT IT SCALES WELL FROM

STONE AGE IT'S A WORKER PLACEMENT BUT GENERALLY SINCE YOU CAN ONLY PLACE WORKERS ON ONE LOCATION AT A TIME YOU GENERALLY KNOW THAT THERE ARE BEST LOCATIONS OK LOCATIONS ETC AND YOU CAN PRIORITIZE WHERE TO PLACE YOUR WORKERS BASED ON A PARTICULAR OPTION THERE IS DECISION MAKING BUT I'D SAY LESS THAN CASTLES OF BURGUNDY

OTHER THOUGHT THAT'S KIND OF BEYOND WHAT YOU ASKED FOR

DUNGEON PETZ NOW DUNGEON PETZ IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY HEAVY MIDWEIGHT THAT SAID IT'S A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME ABOUT RAISING SELLING EXHIBITING YOUR PETZ IT'S INCREDIBLY THEMATIC OH NO I'M FORCED TO PLAY THIS CARD SO NOW MY PET IS ANGRY AND HE JUST BROKE OUT OF HIS CAGE AND HURT THE IMP WHO WAS CARING FOR IT THERE ARE DECISIONS TO BE MADE AND A LITTLE BIT OF CALCULATING POINTS BUT SO MUCH OF THE GAME REVOLVES AROUND THEMATIC DECISIONS I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE AN INTERESTING PLACE IN YOUR COLLECTION BEYOND THE CURRENT MOMENT THE OTHER REASON WHY I'M PUTTING IT OFF TO THE SIDE AS THIS ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASKED FOR BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT IS BECAUSE IT IS LONGER THAN AN HOUR

U GETINFO
WHY DID NO ONE MENTION CANDY LAND YET
CANON NOIR IN FRENCH AND BG SAYS IT HAD THE SAME NAME IN ENGLISH OR BLACK CANNON IN THE FIRST EDITION

BOARDGAME

I STILL HAVE THE GAME YES THERE WAS A WORKING CANNON AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IF YOU TOUCH AN OPPONENT'S SHIP YOU REPLACE IT WITH A SMALLER VERSION ABLE TO CARRY LIMITED AMOUNT OF TREASURES

HAS ANY ONE TRIED THE GREAT WESTERN TRAIL OR CODEX BOTH SEEM INTERESTING
BEST LIST I'VE EVER SEEN NOW I'M ADDING BURAN TO MY WATCHLIST
FINALLY PLAYED CAELUS THE OTHER NIGHT I CAN DEFINITELY APPRECIATE IT FOR IT'S HISTORIC IMPACT ON MODERN GAMES AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANY GAMES SINCE THAT DO EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES BUT IT STILL FEELS A BIT DATED I FEEL LIKE MORE RECENT GAMES HAVE LEARNED FROM IT AND STREAMLINED SOME OF THE CONCEPTS QUITE A BIT MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS THAT ACQUIRING RESOURCES FELT TOO SLOW AND INCREMENTAL YES I KNOW SEEING HOW EFFICIENTLY YOU CAN DO THIS IS PART OF THE GAME IT'S WORTH PLAYING FOR ANYONE INTO HEAVIER EUROS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL BY ANY STRETCH
YES YOU CAN IN FACT THE GAME EXPLICITLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO PLAY A GAME OR TWO OF NORMAL PANDEMIC FIRST IF NOT EVERYONE HAS PLAYED PANDEMIC BEFORE
VALERIA CARD KINGDOMS
A LOT OF REVIEWERS ARE SAYING IT'S FIXED MACHI BORO MORE FUN BETTER STRATEGY QUICKER PLAYTIME AND A FANTASY THEME I BOUGHT IT BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED A REAL GAME JUST A QUICK PRACTICE GAME
SEEMS TO WORK WELL WITH TWO PLAYER AS RADIO LIKES IT
GET THE MOST VICTORY POINTS TO WIN HIRE CHARACTERS WITH A NUMBER ON THEM THEN ROLL TWO DIE IF THE NUMBER IS THE NUMBER OF THE CHARACTER YOU HIRED YOU GET THE REWARD LIKE A MERCHANT WOULD GIVE MONEY WHICH LETS YOU HIRE MORE WORKERS OR BUY DOMAINS WHICH GIVE VICTORY POINTS A WARRIOR WOULD GIVE STRENGTH TOKENS THAT HELP YOU KILL MONSTERS WHICH ALSO GIVE VICTORY POINTS

TRY THE 2 VARIANT

DONT THINK I'D EVER PLAY THE BASE GAME WITHOUT IT IT MEANS YOU CANT BUILD YOUR PERFECT ENGINE AND INTRODUCES A SORT OF DRAFTING ELEMENT TO THE GAME
ARE YOU PLAYING IT WITH JUST THE TWO OF YOU GUYS IN MY OPINION MACHI BORO REALLY NEEDS AT LEAST PEOPLE TO PLAY IT
I'VE NEVER PLAYED MACHI BORO BUT I'VE HEARD IT BEING COMPARED TO A LIGHTER LESS OPTIONS VERSION OF DICE CITY I HAVE PLAYED DICE CITY BEFORE AND WHILE I'M NOT BIG ON DICE GAMES I STILL DID ENJOY MYSELF
MY FAVORITE CITY BUILDING GAME IS SUBURBIA MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING INTO
VALERIA CARD KINGDOMS IS VERY SIMILAR TO MACHI BORO BUT AN IMPROVEMENT IN ANY POSSIBLE WAY ONE MAJOR IMPROVEMENT IS THAT YOU CAN ALSO USE THE SUM OF BOTH DICE TO GET A CARD

BOARDGAME
MECHANICALLY ITS A LITTLE SIMILAR TO CATAN IN THAT YOU ROLL TO ACTIVATE INCOME STREAMS
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY IS A GAME WHERE YOU ROLL DICE AND BUY CHITS TO BUILD A CITY

YOU CAN MANIPULATE DICE ROLLS BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BAD DICE ROLL YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WITH EVERY ROLL

SINCE IT HAS THESE ELEMENTS IT IS SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLICATED THAN MACHI BORO BUT AT THE SAME TIME SIGNIFICANTLY DEEPER AND MORE SATISFYING

IF YOU'RE NOT PLAYING IT WITH THE 2 VARIANT YOU'RE MISSING OUT

ADDITIONALLY I'M BETTING YOUR SO HAD A LOT OF RESTAURANTS WHICH IS WHAT COST YOU SO HEAVILY THE WAY TO DEFEND AGAINST THAT IS TO BUY THE PUBLISHER CARD WHICH RADICALLY DISINCENTIVIZES GOING HEAVILY INTO REDS
I'VE BEEN IN A SIMILAR BOAT WITH MACHI BORO I DIDN'T BUY IT BUT ARTIFACTS INC HAS SIMILAR DICE ROLLING AND DEVELOPMENT BUT WITH A LITTLE MORE MEAT
IF SHE ENJOYS DICE I WOULD RECOMMEND KINGSBURG IT'S A DICE PLACEMENT GAME WITH THE RESOURCES YOU GATHER THROUGH THE DICE YOU BUILD BUILDINGS WHICH YOU USE TO DEFEND YOUR KINGDOM FROM ARMIES AT THE END OF A ROUND IT'S FAIRLY SIMPLE AND FUN IT DOES HAVE A FANTASY THEME THOUGH PERSONALLY WE ENJOY IT WITH TWO PLAYERS BUT YOU CAN PLAY UP TO PLAYERS
IF YOU WANT TO STICK TO DICE BUT GO A MEATIER WAY ROLL FOR THE GALAXY COULD BE THE WAY TO GO

WAY EASIER TO ACCESS THAN IT'S ANCESTOR RACE FOR THE GALAXY BUT REAL SOLID DEPTH

IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE LEAGUE OF MACHI BORO BUT ARE OPEN TO MOVING AWAY FROM THE DICE TRY SPLENDOR

AND AS MENTIONED MACHI BORO ONLY SHINES WITH THE EXPANSION AND PLAY STILE 2 VIOLET LOW NUMBER HIGH NUMBER BUILDINGS
MAINLY ON THEME ART BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND FLIP CITY IT IS A DECK BUILDING PUSH YOUR LUCK GAME WHERE THE BUILDINGS YOU BUY AND OR FLIP IMPROVE YOUR DECK OFFERING YOU VARIOUS WAYS TO WIN IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY DICE BUT YOU ARE SIMILARLY BUYING CARDS TO BUILD YOUR CITY DECK AND THE PUSH YOUR LUCK ELEMENT IS FUN SIMILAR WEIGHT ART FEEL IT IS INEXPENSIVE AND PLAYS GREAT WITH TWO WHILE USING SOME DIFFERENT BASIC MECHANICS
THE EXPANSION FOR MACHI BORO ACTUALLY TRANSFORMS IT INTO A QUITE GOOD AND VARIED GAME I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE BASE GAME EITHER AN WON'T PLAY IT WITHOUT THE EXPANSION
ONE SUGGESTION ABOUT MACHI BORO THE RULES AS WRITTEN MAKE IT TAKE QUITE A LONG TIME I ACCIDENTALLY CAME UP WITH WHAT I CALL THE TURBO VERSION WHICH ALLOWS PLAYERS TO PURCHASE AS MANY CARDS AS THEY CAN AFFORD ON ONE TURN IT MAKES THE GAME PLAY FASTER AND INTRODUCES DIFFERENT STRATEGIES MIX THAT IN WITH THE CARD SELECTION RULES FROM THE HARBOR EXPANSION AND IT'S LIKE A NEW GAME
DOMINION SAINT PETERSBURG AND SPLENDOR ARE SOME OTHER LIGHT GAMES BUT WITHOUT THE RANDOMNESS OF THE DICE

ROLL THROUGH THE AGES IS A LIGHT DICE GAME WITH CIVILIZATION BUILDING ASPECTS
IF YOU'RE STICKING TO THE CITY BUILDING THEME DICE CITY AS OTHERS RECOMMENDED IS THE WAY TO GO FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT CHECK OUT CV A DICE ROLLING GAME WHERE CARDS YOU BUY CREATE YOUR STORY
COLONY IS A SLIGHTLY HEAVIER DICE MANIPULATION GAME I HATE TO SAY THEY ARE SIMILAR BUT IT'S A CLEVER AND ACCESSIBLE DICE GAME
HOW ABOUT ANOTHER CITY BUILDER LIKE IMPERIAL SETTLERS NO DICE THOUGH
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY
IF YOU WANT GAMES THAT HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF PLAYER INVOLVEMENT I SUGGEST WAR THE CARD GAME

IF YOU WANT GREAT GAMES THAT HAVE RESOURCE PRODUCTION YOU REALLY CAN'T GO BETTER THAN CATAN IT'S NOT GREAT 2 PLAYER BUT WITH OR IT'S A LOT OF FUN
I'M NOT SURE THE POSTING RULES AND I'M ON MOBILE BUT I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD DEAL SO I POSTED IT I LOVE BOARD GAMES AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF MY COLLECTION INSTEAD OF MY PARENTS I'M EXCITED
I WOULD RECOMMEND STAR REALMS IT'S A GREAT TWO PLAYER GAME AND THE APP IS GREAT ON A LARGER SCREEN LIKE AN IPAD THEY HAVE THE PASS AND PLAY MODE BUT ALSO CHALLENGE MODE FOR WHEN YOU'RE APART AND MISSION MODE FOR A SINGLE PLAYER
THE ASCENSION APP IS PRETTY GREAT IT DOES ALL THE MATHS WITH THE CARD INTERACTIONS FOR YOU AND IT'S PASS AND PLAY
SPLENDOR ON ANDROID IS BASICALLY REMOVES THE ONLY CON FOR PAPER SPLENDOR FOR ME WHICH IS PEOPLE BEING UPSET BUT ON THE APP YOU PLAY AGAINST AI SO THATS NOT A PROBLEM
GALAXY TRUCKER
PATCHWORK IT'S ASYNCHRONOUS LIGHTER AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE TWO PLAYER GAMES EVER MY GIRLFRIEND AND I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME AND WE PLAY AS WELL
MY FAVOURITE BOARDGAME APP PARTLY BECAUSE I LOVE THE GAME AND PARTLY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A BRILLIANT IMPLEMENTATION IS NEUROSHIMA HEX

IT HAS UNDO FUNCTIONALITY TOO

OTHER THAN THAT I THINK MOST OF THE GAMES I GOT FROM THE MOST RECENT HUMBLE BUNDLE HAD PRETTY GOOD PASS AND PLAY TICKET TO RIDE SMALL WORLD 2 LABYRINTH PASS AND PLAY IS ANNOYINGLY BUGGY BUT PLAYABLE MOST OF THEM ARE PRETTY SIMPLE AS WELL
ON IOS I PLAY CARCASSONNE AND LORDS OF WATERDEEP A LOT DOWNLOADED AGRICOLA BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET AND CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG DOESN'T LOOK TOO GOOD ON MY PHONE BUT IT MAY BE BETTER ON IPAD
PAPERBACK
SAN JUAN IS EXCELLENT
TICKET TO RIDE
SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE IS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF FUN THE EXPANSIONS ARE NOT SUPER CHEAP BUT THEY ADD SO MUCH TO THE GAME

EDIT I NEVER POST ANYTHING OR UNVOTE VERY PASSIVE USER THIS GAME DESERVES TO BE PLAYED BY PEOPLE WHO LIKE PLAYING GAMES

GOOD PLACE TO START IS R DIGITALTABLETOP
COUP AND PATCHWORK COME TO MIND I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THESE ONES BUT THEY'RE BOTH BY THE SAME DEV AS PATCHWORK LE HAVRE THE INLAND PORT AGRICOLA AL CREATURES BIG AND SMALL
I REALLY ENJOYED PLAYING ELDER SIGN AND TALISMAN ON MOBILE THEY WORKED VERY WELL FOR PASS AND PLAY WHEN I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY PHYSICAL GAMES TO PLAY
STAR REALMS DOES NETWORKED BASED PLAY IT'S GREAT FOR COUPLES PLAY
DIRE WOLF DID AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH LANTERNS AWESOME PORT OF IT
ASCENSION AND CATAN ARE MY MOST PLAYED TAKES DIMMET WOULD FIT THE BILL TOO
I THINK SUBURBIA HAS PASS AND PLAY AS WELL
AS AN OBSESSIVE VIDEO GAMER I LIKE CONTENT VARIETY AND THE FEELING OF MASTERY IN MY BOARD GAME PORTS MY REVIEWS

ANDROMION SO MUCH VARIETY SO EASY TO USE DIFFERENT AI ACHIEVEMENTS LOTS OF WAYS TO TINKER I FELT LIKE IT GOT BETTER PLAYING THIS BUT NOW YOU CAN'T GET IT VIA PLAY STORE

TICKET TO RIDE EH WOULD BE NEAT IF AT HAD A WORLD TOUR MODE AND COULD TINKER WITH ALL KINDS OF VARIABLES BEING A VIDEO GAME NATURALLY IT'S GREAT IF YOU DO HAVE A GOOD TR GROUP

SMALL WORLD LIKE TR HAD POTENTIAL ESPECIALLY IF IT IMPLEMENTED REALMS CREATABLE SCENARIOS AND SUCH

STEAM RAILS TO RICHES THIS WAS BASED OFF RAILROAD TYCOON IF RR TYCOON WAS ON MOBILE THIS WOULD BLOW AWAY STEAM SAME MAP SAME GAMEPLAY NO NEW MAPS NO CAMPAIGN NO MAP EDITOR

CATAN WHEN I GOT THIS YEARS AGO THE CAMPAIGN WAS LOCKED THIS DEFIES ALL LOGIC TO ME AS A VIDEO GAME HOPEFULLY THIS ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE

GALAXY TRUCKER YES YES YES YES YES YES THIS IS WHAT I WANT HOLY CRAP THIS IS GOES BEYOND WHAT A LICENSED BOARD GAME DOES THEY DID EVERYTHING I WANTED CAMPAIGN PROGRESSION TINKERING WITH THE RULES WOW WOW WOW I BEAT THIS AND WAS SO HAPPY PASS AND PLAY TURN BASED I MADE THIS ON BG SO YOU CAN PLAY IT WITH THE ACTUAL BOARD GAME

AGAIN THIS GOES THREE STEPS ABOVE NEARLY EVERY OTHER BOARD GAME APPARENTLY

CONGRATS TO THE DEVS FOR THIS

SUBURBIA I JUST GOT PLANET COASTER FOR PC SO SUBURBIA GIVES ME THE WARM FUZZY FEELING PLANET COASTER GAVE ME THE STAR CHALLENGES ARE LOVELY NOW I WANT TO MAKE SOLO CHALLENGES FOR THE BOARD GAME

NEUROSHIMA HEX SO MUCH WASTED POTENTIAL IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO RECRUIT TILES AND PLAY MATCHES IN A CAMPAIGN LIKE MICROPROSE MAGIC OR PUZZLE QUEST

ANYWAYS THE GAME IS OK HARD INCENTIVE TO KEEP PLAYING MY VERSION DOESN'T HAVE A QUICK REFERENCE OPTION
GAMES WITH APPS SO GOOD THEY WORK BETTER THAN THE REAL THING

STAR REALMS

SPLENDOR

NEUROSHIMA HEX

SMALL WORLD
ARTUS REGGI THE DIGITAL VERSION IS A WORK OF ARTICLE
CARCASSONNE IS GREAT ON THE IPAD TABLET ALSO TICKET TO RIDE IS GOOD AND USUALLY ON SALE A LOT IN THE APP STORE
REINER INGENIOUS IS A REALLY SOLID APP FOR A SIMPLE TO LEARN TRICKY TO MASTER GAME ABOUT TILE PLACEMENT AND COMBOS DEFINITELY GREAT AT TWO PLAYER CONTROLS FOR SPINNING SWAPPING PLACING TILES FEEL GREAT AND IT'S PERFECT FOR WAITING IN LINE AT A RESTAURANT

PLUS IT'S SO NOT MUCH OF A RISK
RED HAS A GOOD IMPLEMENTATION WITH SUPPORT
NOT SURE IF CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG IS ON ANDROID BUT IT'S GREAT ON IOS
I'M REALLY ENJOYING THE PATHFINDER ADVENTURE CARD GAME
I'VE RECENTLY DOWNLOADED CTHULHU REALMS AND IT'S PRETTY GREAT IT OFFERS A LOT OF CONTENT FOR FREE
I GUESS WHAT I HAD BEEN HOPING FOR WAS FOR THEM TO BE DESIGNED FOR PASS AND PLAY AND IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM LIKE THEY ARE

I SEEM TO REMEMBER THAT ALL THE ONES I'VE TRIED HAVE INCLUDED PASS AND PLAY WHICH GAMES SPECIFICALLY DON'T HAVE IT
GALAXY TRUCKER HAS A LOCAL OR YOU CAN SETUP ONLINE GAMES WITH RESERVED SPOTS FOR NAMED PLAYERS I EAST FOR JUST THE TWO OF YOU
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANDROID BUT THE IOS AGRICOLA IS AN RECREATION OF THE BOARD GAME
THE NEWEST ONES THAT I LIKE TO PLAY CURRENTLY ARE PAPERBACK LANTERNS AND STONE AGE AGRICOLA HAS A GREAT APP IMPLEMENTATION AS DOES LORDS OF WATERDEEP AND ALL OF THE SMALL BOX UWE GAMES I ALSO LOVE TICKET TO RIDE BATTLE LINE SUSHI GO BASEBALL HIGHLIGHTS CARCASSONNE AND SPLENDOR ALSO SPLENDOR JUST ADDED ONLINE PLAY RED JUST LAUNCHED AN APP AND IF YOU LIKE HOKKAIDO THEY SHOULD BE LAUNCHING THEIR APP VERY SOON
YOU HAVE HOURS TO GET IN ON THE HUMBLE MOBILE BUNDLE WHICH HAS A LOAD OF GOOD BOARDGAMES IN IT CARCASSONNE AND SMALL WORLD 2 ARE PRETTY SHORT AND PRETTY GREAT AND I CAN VOUCH FOR GALAXY TRUCKER BEING FUN AS WELL EVEN IF YOU'RE DOING THE SOLO CAMPAIGN WHILE YOUR FRIENDS ARE UNAVAILABLE
ELDER SIGN IS MY FAVORITE GAME ON ANDROID THE PRODUCTION VALUES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF AND IT PLAYS REALLY WELL TICKET TO RIDE IS THE RUNNER UP
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE BUNDLE THAT'S UP RIGHT NOW CARCASSONNE AND TICKET TO RIDE ARE IN THAT BUNDLE AND BOTH HAVE PASS AND PLAY

ETA AND SAN JUAN AND GALAXY TRUCKER
SMALLSWORD IS AN EXCELLENT TRANSLATION
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANDROID BUT I THINK SMALL WORLD IS EXCELLENT ON THE IPAD NO TEDIOUS SETUP OR CLEANUP AND BECAUSE NOBODY HAS A HAND TO KEEP SECRET YOU DON'T HAVE TO PASS IT AROUND YOU JUST SET IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE AND PLAY
LORDS OF WATERDEEP ASCENSION STAR REALMS NEUROSHIMA HEX HEROES OF THE MULTIVERSE SEE THE WEBSITE POCKETTACTICS FOR MORE GREAT IDEAS OH AGRICOLA
I HAVE A LOT OF DOWN TIME AT WORK AND I PLAY A LOT ON MY TABLET MY MOST PLAYED GAMES ARE DEFINITELY CARCASSONNE ELDER SIGN OMENS CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG AND GALAXY TRUCKER AS FAR AS A QUALITY DIGITAL VERSION IS CONCERNED I THINK PANDEMIC IS THE BEST ONE OUT THERE THE ONLY ONES I'VE PLAYED THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND AGAINST ARE CATAN THE AI IS A DIRTY CHEATER AND SMALL WORLD THE TEXT IS BUGGED AND SOMETIMES UNREADABLE TO SEE WHAT BUFFS YOU HAVE
COLT EXPRESS IS COMING SOON ANY DAY NOW TO IOS AND ANDROID IT'S ON STEAM AS OF THREE DAYS AGO CAN'T WAIT FOR IT
THE ONES I'VE PLAYED ALWAYS FROM AN IPHONE SCREEN PERSPECTIVE

GALAXY TRUCKER GREAT BETTER THAN THE BOARD GAME ACTUALLY HOUSEKEEPING THE FLIGHT PHASE IS A PAIN IN THE ASS

ASCENSION I DON'T LIKE THIS GAME BUT THE APP IS OK A BIT TOO SMALL FOR AN IPHONE SCREEN

NEUROSHIMA HEX GREAT GOOD IMPLEMENTATION AND SCREEN VISIBILITY

STAR REALMS AWFUL CLOSED IT IN SECONDS NEVER WANT TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN IT'S ALL SO SMALL YOU CAN'T SEE A SINGLE THING MAYBE TRY WITH AN IPAD
STONE AGE WE ACTUALLY PREFER IT ON A MOBILE DEVICE OVER OUR PHYSICAL COPY
I LOVE MOST OF THE APPS MENTIONED HERE BUT ONE NOT MENTIONED MUCH IS TWILIGHT STRUGGLE WE JUST DOWNLOADED THIS LAST NIGHT IT'S NOT AVAILABLE IN ANDROID IOS AND STEAM ONLY I THINK BUT IT IS VERY VERY WELL DONE GREAT INTERFACE
PANDEMIC I WOULD SAY SMALL WORLD 2 BUT CIRC YOU GOT THAT FROM THE HUMBLE BUNDLE
AGRICOLA ABAS GOT A GREAT APPARENTLY I ENJOY IT QUITE A BIT
I'VE SHARED A LOT OF OPINIONS ON THIS GAME AROUND THE WEB INCLUDING A WRITTEN REVIEW HETP I DID RIGHT AFTER IT CAME OUT

I'M A BIG FAN OF IT THE FANTASY STORY IS GENERIC IN A GOOD WAY TROLLS ARE TROLLS GIANTS ARE GIANT SO YOU DON'T NEED TO GET BOGGED DOWN IN LEARNING A WHOLLY UNIQUE FANTASY TABLEAU FOR THE SAKE OF IT WHERE THE STORY BECOMES UNIQUE IS IN HOW THE PLAYER INTERACTS WITH IT AND THE PATH THEY TAKE

TOKEN COMBAT IS AWESOME AND THEY'RE ALREADY SHOWING NEW THINGS THEY CAN DO WITH THEM IN THE EXPANSIONS WHICH IS GREAT THE FALL OF THE DARK STAR SCENARIO EXPANSION IS AN EXCELLENT ONE BECAUSE IT CHANGES THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF THE SCENARIO AWAY FROM KILL BIG BAD EVIL THING THE SYSTEM HAS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY UNFORTUNATELY THE EXPANSIONS MAKE SET UP VERY FIDDLY I LIKE RUNEBOUND BECAUSE IT'S A CASUAL BEER AND PRETZELS ADVENTURE GAME AND EXPANSION SET UP TAKES A BIT AWAY FROM THAT
IT'S OKAY THE ACTION SYSTEM AND THE SENSE OF PROGRESSION ARE NICE THE WORLD SEEMS KIND OF GENERIC I WAS EXPECTING TO LIKE THE COMBAT SYSTEM MORE THAN I DID THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT BUT MOST OF THE TIME YOUR CHOICES ARE OBVIOUS
I LIKE THE GAME I WOULD BUY MORE BUT I CONSIDER THE EXPANSIONS FFA HAVE RELEASED THUS FAR TO BE A RIPOFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN 2 EXPANSIONS AT MOST AND PERHAPS ONLY

SO UNFORTUNATELY NOT NEW RUNEBOUND FOR ME AT THIS TIME
I GOT IT AS A PRESENT DURING THE SUMMER AND IT'S STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES PLAYED IT RECENTLY WITH MY GAMING GROUP AND THEY ALL REALLY ENJOYED IT WITH PLAYERS IT TOOK US HOURS AND IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT AT ALL TIME FLEW THE TOKEN COMBAT IS GREAT AND BEEFING UP YOUR CHARACTER IS SATISFYING I'VE ALSO PLAYED IT SOLO WITH 2 CHARACTERS TRYING TO CHOOSE THE BEST OPTIONS IN COMBAT AND IT WORKS QUITE WELL I DEFINITELY PLAN ON GETTING THE EXPANSIONS AT SOME POINT WHEN THEY ARE ON SALE THE GAME REMINDS ME OF TALISMAN WITH ITS FANTASY STYLE AND GOING AROUND TRYING TO LEVEL UP BUT IMO IT'S FAR SUPERIOR AND BETTER DESIGNED WOULD RECOMMEND
IT'S ONLY LIKE ON AMAZON HOW CHEAP ARE WE TALKING
IT COULD BE DOABLE BUT YOU WOULD NEED A LIST OF ALL THE CHARACTER'S ABILITIES THERE'S CHARACTERS WHICH EACH HAVE A SENTENCE OR TWO ABILITY YOU WOULD NEED TO REFERENCE FOR THE GAME PLAY ITSELF IS ALL BASED ON THE SYMBOLS ON THE DICE WHICH DON'T DEPEND ON WHICH LANGUAGE THE RULES ARE IN

EDIT ON BG THERE IS THE OFFICIAL ENGLISH RULEBOOK WHICH INCLUDES THE RULES TEXT FOR EACH CHARACTER
YOU CAN'T PLAY THE GERMAN VERSION WITHOUT KNOWING ANY GERMAN YOU'D AT LEAST NEED TO PUT PASTE UPS ON THE CHARACTER CARDS OR PRINT THE CHARACTER SECTION FROM THE RULEBOOK FOR EACH PLAYER AT THAT POINT YOU MIGHT JUST BUY THE ENGLISH VERSION UNLESS YOU GET IT FOR FREE
MY ONLY CONCERN WOULD BE THE CHARACTER'S CARD BECAUSE THEY INCLUDE TEXT CONCERNING EACH ONE'S SPECIAL ABILITIES

YOU CAN ALWAYS HAVE A PRINTED ENGLISH MANUAL FOR REFERENCE BUT I FIND IT A LITTLE ANNOYING FOR 1ST TIME PLAYERS
THE ENGLISH VERSION HAS BOTH ENGLISH AND ITALIAN ON EACH CARD DOES THE GERMAN VERSION HAVE ANOTHER LANGUAGE

THE CHARACTER CARDS ARE LANGUAGE DEPENDENT IF YOU CAN'T READ THEM YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY VERY EASILY
DEPENDS HOW GOOD IS YOUR ITALIAN
I TOOK A LOOK LOOKS INTERESTING

I DREAM OF DESIGNING MY OWN GAME SO A BIG PROP TO YOU AND I WISH YOU GREAT SUCCESS
ALREADY A BACKER AND I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THE STRETCH GOALS SO FAR I APPRECIATE HOW PASSIONATE YOU ARE ABOUT THE PROJECT AND I'M SURE IT COMES THROUGH IN THE GAME I'M EXCITED TO GET A COPY
LOOKS LIKE AN INTERESTING GAME YOU HAVE THERE THE PRICE IS REASONABLE AND POSTAGE ISN'T A BIG DEAL TO ME HERE IN IRELAND EITHER MY BOARD GAME BUDGET ISN'T IN THE BEST OF SHAPE AT THE MOMENT BUT I'VE ADDED THIS TO MY WATCH LIST AND I MAY JUST MAKE THE PLUNGE BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN ENDS BEST OF LUCK
LOVE IT

OBSERVATIONS

I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL STRATEGY IS AS WELL AS THE HOW TO PLAY WHICH IS BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE AND MINIMALIST

THE BEARDED YOUTUBE AID HELPED BUT I'D LIKE A DIAGRAM BOX OF SOME STRATEGY MOVES ILLUSTRATED TO SHOW THE STRATEGY INVOLVED MIGHT HELP

BACKING IT

IS THERE CHANCE TO GET FOR XMAS THE PERFECT PACKAGE INSIDE A XMAS PRESENT MEME
THANKS ALL WE JUST HIT FUNDED AND THE ANALYTICS ON KICKSTARTER TELL ME THAT HALF A DOZEN BACKERS HAVE COME FROM REDDIN

BIG LOVE GUYS
MY CHURCH USED TO DO A DOMINO TOURNAMENT JUST GET A BUNCH OF DOUBLE OR DOUBLE SETS WHICH YOU CAN PROBABLY FIND AT A DOLLAR STORE OURS WAS KIND OF INTENSE WITH SOMEONE RUNNING A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT TRACKED EVERYONE'S SCORES BUT YOU COULD DO IT ON PAPER TOO

LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILS
LIAR'S DICE MIGHT BE FUN YOU CAN BUY IT ONLINE ALSO MARKETED AS PELUDO BUT YOU JUST NEED DICE AND A DICE CUP PER PERSON AND THE RULES ARE ONLINE AND I THINK YOU CAN DOWNLOAD TOURNAMENT RULES ON AS WELL AS READ ABOUT RULES VARIANTS ETC
BEZZERWIZZER IS A BLAST CHECK IT OUT
TERRA HAD A NICE YOU DON'T NEED THE EXACT ANSWER JUST BE CLOSEST KIND F FEEL TO IT GOOD FUN AS WELL
TIMELINE CARDLIKE AND TIMELINE CHALLENGE AREN'T STRAIGHT FORWARD TRIVIA BUT COME CLOSE
SMARTY PARTY CAN BE FUN AND I ALSO ENJOY BEZZERWIZZER ALTHOUGH MY FAVORITE IS AMERICA WHICH HAS A LITTLE MORE STRATEGY INVOLVED THAN MOST TRIVIA GAMES
LINKED IS A REALLY FUN TRIVIA GAME WHERE YOU'RE ALSO TRYING TO GUESS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TRIVIA ANSWERS
SMART ASS THE PEOPLE LOVE THE GAME AND LOVE TO MAKE THE JOKE LOOK RON THIS GAME HAS YOUR NAME WRITTEN ALL OVER IT
SMART ASS IS VERY FUN
CRANIUM IS ALWAYS FUN WITH THE TRIVIA CROWD

I WONDER IF AMAZON OR TARGET MIGHT SHIP WITS AND WAGERS TO YOU


I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE THE CASE IN NEW ZEALAND BUT I SEE WITS AND WAGERS ON THRIFT STORE SHELVES FAIRLY FREQUENTLY HERE IN THE STATES WHO KNOWS MIGHT GET LUCKY

ALSO NOT EXACTLY A TRIVIA GAME BUT I THINK BALDERDASH DEFINITELY HAS SOME SIMILARITIES A PLAYER DRAWS A CARD WITH A DEFINITION FOR AN EXTREMELY OBSCURE WORD AND EVERYONE AT THE TABLE TRIES TO WRITE A PHONY DEFINITION THAT'S JUST CONVINCING ENOUGH TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR IT AS AN OLD GAME YOU CAN ALSO FIND RESOURCES TO PLAY IT ONLINE WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING TO PURCHASE A MANUFACTURED COPY
I WOULD SUGGEST AVOIDING WITS AND WAGERS IF YOU'RE NOT BASED IN THE US MOST OF THE QUESTIONS HAVE A US SLANT TO THEM LOTS OF BASEBALL BASKETBALL AND AMERICAN FOOTBALL AND THEY USE IMPERIAL MEASURING SYSTEMS SO IT'S NOT AS MUCH FUN IF THAT ISN'T YOUR BACKGROUND

TIMELINE IS REALLY FUN THOUGH AND ALWAYS GETS NEW PLAYERS QUITE INVESTED I ALSO SUGGEST GEEK OUT WHICH MIXES TRIVIA WITH BLUFFING AND BIDDING BUT YOU NEED TO PLAY WITH OTHER NERDS AS THE QUESTIONS ARE ALL ABOUT SCI-FI FANTASY VIDEOGAMES ETC

LASTLY I'VE MADE MY OWN TRIVIA GAME FOR WHICH I'M CURRENTLY SEEKING PLAYTESTERS THE IDEA BEHIND IT IS THAT QUESTIONS ARE FRAMED IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS PLAYERS TO DEDUCE ANSWERS EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT SURE OPENING THE WINDOW TO BLUFFING THE OTHER TEAM ETC THERE IS CURRENTLY A PAGE DEMO WHICH IS ENOUGH FOR ONE GAME DROP ME A MESSAGE IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO SHARE IT WITH YOU

EDIT A QUICK SUGGESTION IS TO COMBINE WITS AND WAGERS WITH TIMELINE USING THE WITS AND WAGERS SYSTEM WITH THE TIMELINE QUESTIONS MY GAME GROUP HAD A BLAST WITH THAT
CHECK THIS OUT

EDIT NEVER MIND I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE OFFER HAS ENDED SORRY
BEZZERWIZZER VIDEO LINK

AND

ZERO VIDEO LINK

IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU GUYS TYPICALLY PLAY WITH IF IT'S JUST THE TWO OF YOU THEN CTA IS THE GAME YOU WANT TO GO WITH IF IT'S OR MORE THEN DEFINITELY ECLIPSE

BUT BOTH ARE GREAT GAMES SO YOU SHOULDN'T BE DISAPPOINTED AS LONG AS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HEAVY GAME
THE NEW VERSION OF THROUGH THE AGES IS REALLY GOOD IT'S BEEN REBALANCED AND STREAMLINED IT WILL DEFINITELY GIVE YOU THAT CIV EXPERIENCE I WOULD GO FOR THAT ONE OVER ECLIPSE I OWN BOTH IF YOU HAD TOLD ME YOU LIKED MASTER OF ORION 2 THEN I WOULD HAVE PICKED THE OTHER
CIV FAN FROM THE ORIGINAL INCIDENTALLY HAVEN'T PLAYED MUCH OF V AND VI CTA A NEW STORY OF CIV IS BASICALLY THE CIV TECH TREE CITY POPULATION MANAGEMENT TURNING IN BOARDGAME

IF YOU WANT A TASTE OF CTA YOU CAN PLAY IT FOR FREE AT TRY BEFORE YOU BUY THE IMPLEMENTATION FEELS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN THE ONE AT BUT ALSO AVAILABLE AT THE LATTER ALSO FREE

EDIT F HAS NEVER PLAYED THE CIV SERIES BUT PLAYING CTA ONLINE HAD HER FEELING THE JUST ONE MORE TURN HOOK AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT IT'S HRS LATER
THEY'RE BOTH SO GREAT YOU PROBABLY CAN'T GO WRONG WITH EITHER IF IT'S JUST MOSTLY YOU TWO PLAYING THEN GET THROUGH THE AGES BUT IT'S IF IT'S A GROUP OF THAT MEETS REGULARLY GET ECLIPSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY CTA WITH MORE THAN AND ECLIPSE BASE GAME PLAYS UP TO BEAUTIFULLY

WHICHEVER ONE YOU CHOOSE CONSIDER ALSO GETTING THE ACRYLIC OVERLAYS LIKE THESE FOR ECLIPSE OR THESE FOR CTA IT WILL SAVE YOU MAJOR HEADACHES FROM A TABLE BUMP
I GOT ECLIPSE FOR BUCKS ON THAT ASMODEUS HOLIDAY SALE SITE NOT SURE IF IT'S STILL IN STOCK
CTA IS GREAT AT 2 AND AND OKAYISH AT ECLIPSE IS MPH AT 2 OK AT AND GREAT AT SO IN THAT WAY YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITH CTA
CTA ALSO GIVES YOU THE CIV FEELING BETTER I THINK ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T HAVE THE EXPLORE PART WHICH IS EXACTLY THE REASON I LOVE IT BUT SOME PEOPLE MISS THAT

FOR TRULY THE MOST GAME YOU SHOULD LOOK AT CLASH OF CULTURES OR JUST CIVILIZATION BOTH FINE GAMES BUT CTA IS THE BEST OF THESE AND SUCH A GOOD TWO PLAYER GAME IT DOES TAKE A BIT LONG TO PLAY BUT THAT TIME GOES DOWN VERY QUICKLY AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE PLAYS
CTA IS A TRULY GREAT GAME BUT IT'S IS CONSIDERABLY HEAVIER THEN WHAT YOU'VE PLAYED BEFORE IT'S ALSO QUITE LONG TAKING A GOOD THREE HOURS TO GET THROUGH THE REDUCED NO AGE III GAME

HAVE YOU CONSIDERED FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE WHICH IS SIMILARLY LONG AND HEAVY
I WOULD RECOMMEND AGAINST ECLIPSE MY GROUP LIKES THEIR SHARE OF LONGER EURO GAMES AGRICOLA POWER GRID ETC BUT SETUP AND GAMEPLAY WAS SIMPLY TOO SLOW YOU SIT AROUND DOING NOTHING FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHEN ITS NOT YOUR TURN AND THERE ISN'T TOO MUCH SOCIAL TRADING GOING ON EITHER TO FILL UP THESE GAPS PLUS THE GAME SIMPLY TAKES TOO LONG

THEORETICALLY I LIKE THE GAME BUT IN PRACTICE IT TURNED OUT NOT SO WELL FOR US
IF YOU ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR A EURO THAT STILL GIVES YOU THAT EPIC FEELING AND HAS A BIT MORE DEPTH TAKE A LOOK AT SCYTHE IF YOU DIDN'T ALREADY I HAVE PLAYED ALL AND IT JUST HAS AN ELEGANT BEAUTY THAT IS UNMATCHED
BCOM IS FUN COOP

FORTUNES AND GLORY BATTLE NAZIS OR THE MOB WHILE BEING INDIANA JONES STYLE RELIC HUNTERS PLAYER TEAM COOP AND VERSUS OPTIONS REALLY FUN

SPLENDOR IS NICE BUT I'D DEMO IT FIRST JUST IN CASE NOT SURE YOU'D LIKE IT BASED ON YOUR NO-NO LIST

YOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY SMASH UP TONS OF EXPANSIONS MAKES FOR VERY INTERESTING
COMBINATIONS EVERY TIME IT'S PLAYED 2 PLAYER IS FUN AND IT ALSO SCALES UP VERY WELL ESPECIALLY WHEN EXPANSIONS MIXED INTO THINGS

CARD WISE YOU MAY ENJOY FLUX LOTS OF DIFFERENT THEME DECKS VERY FAST PLAY BUT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE GAME IT RARELY
PLAYS THE SAME WAY

AEC MAKES TONS OF GREAT CARD GAMES FOR 2 PLAYERS HAVEN'T FOUND ANY YET THAT I DON'T ENJOY MANY OF THEIR GAMES ARE VERY COMPACT LITTLE BAGS TOO SO YOU COULD BRING THEM WITH YOU ON DUTY

COUP IS FUN AND SCALES UP WELL FUN BLUFFING GAME THIS COULD BE PLAYED WITH 2 AND IT'S COMPACT SO YOU COULD BUY A DECK FOR WHEN YOU'RE ON DUTY AND PLAY WITH OTHERS AS WELL
SPLENDOR WORKS WELL 2 PLAYER AND SCALES WELL
MARGI 2 PLAYER WORKER PLACEMENT GAME IS HIGHLY REGARDED

RAVENS OF HRI SAHASHRI IS A COOP PUZZLE GAME




U GETINFO
BEYOND BAKER STREET VERY MUCH ENJOY IT WITH MY WIFE BUT PLAYS UP TO FOUR JUST AS WELL BETTER THAN THE COMPARATIVE HANAFI WITH MORE TO DO AND WAYS TO PLAY
MY BEST FRIEND EX AND I HAVE A SIMILAR ISSUE IN TERMS OF US PLAYING A LOT OF GAMES WITH LARGE GROUPS BUT SOMETIMES WE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE HASSLE OF OTHER PAIN IN THE ASS PEOPLE SO I STARTED PICKING UP OTHER GAMES THAT WORK WELL FOR US AND THAT PLAY WITH MORE

SEASONS WAS A SURPRISE HIT FOR US AND YOU COULD REPACK THE COMPONENTS INTO A RELATIVELY SMALL BOX IF YOU WANT TO DITCH THE LARGE BOX IT'S A CARD GAME WITH A DICE ASPECT WHERE THE NUMBER OF DICE USED SCALES BY PLAYER IT DOES START WITH A DRAFT SO IT CAN BE RELATIVELY CHESSYLITE AT TWO IT'S EXCELLENT AT TWO IT'S EXCELLENT AT FIVE IT'S VERY FUN TO LEARN IT WITH A SO AND LEARN THE CARDS ON EQUAL FOOTING AND YOU'LL NOTICE LIKELY THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE VALUE CARDS DIFFERENTLY OUT OF THE GATE AND YOU'LL LEARN EVENTUALLY VARIOUS CARDS TO CHAIN TOGETHER FOR CRAZY RESULTS

FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE SCALES VERY WELL BETWEEN IT'S A HEAVY UNFORGIVING GAME AND MORE ECONOMIC THAN MOST OF WHAT YOU LISTED BUT IT'S INSANELY GOOD NOTE THAT THIS REQUIRES A LOT OF TABLE SPACE UNLESS YOU PURCHASE AN INSERT FOR THE BOX

WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES TEND TO SCALE RELATIVELY WELL BECAUSE GENERALLY YOU JUST MAKE LESS SPACES AVAILABLE DEPENDING ON NUMBER OF PLAYERS STONE AGE IS THE ONE THAT'S GENERALLY MOST WELL KNOWN I WOULD SAY AND HAS A HEAVY DICE COMPONENT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'D LIKE STONE AGE THOUGH BASED ON YOUR DISLIKE FOR CASTLES OF BURGUNDY DUNGEON PETZ IS MORE ECONOMIC AND DOES NOT HAVE DICE INSTEAD THERE'S A LITTLE MIND GAME WHERE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN TAKING MORE ACTIONS VS HAVING FIRST CHOICE IN ACTIONS

YOU CAN ALSO TRY OTHER VERSIONS OF HIDDEN MOVEMENT GAMES SINCE YOU LIKED LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL LETTERS IS GENERALLY THE MOST PURE DEDUCTIVE IN THE GENRE WHERE THE OTHERS HAVE MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES I LOVE HIDDEN MOVEMENT GAMES AND AM A HUGE FAN OF SPECTER OPS AND FURY OF DRACULA SPECTER OPS CHANGES QUITE A BIT DEPENDING ON NUMBER OF PLAYERS AT THERE'S A TRAITOR FOR EXAMPLE MY ARMY FRIENDS LOVE SPECTER OPS LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL IS MORE OF A RACE WHILE SPECTER OPS HAS THE HUNTERS SPENDING MORE TIME TRYING TO HOLD LINES OF SIGHT AND IMPAIR THE AGENT'S MOVEMENT WHILE THEY NARROW DOWN LOCATION FURY OF DRACULA IS THE LONGEST IN THE GENRE AND IS ABOUT TO GO OUT OF PRINT AND REVOLVES MUCH MORE AROUND HEAD TO HEAD COMBAT GETTING INSIDE EACH OTHERS HEADS FOR A STYLE GAME BOTH SPECTER OPS AND FURY OF DRACULA GIVE CHARACTERS SPECIAL ABILITIES AND VARIOUS CARDS SO THERE ARE MORE BELLS AND WHISTLES DISTRACTIONS THINGS TO DO IF YOU CAN'T TRACK DOWN THE PERSON YOU'RE HUNTING

SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE IS A COOPERATIVE SUPERHERO THEMED CARD GAME THAT'S GREAT FOR ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT WANT TO PLAY YOUR FIRST FEW TWO PLAYER GAMES WITH TWO CHARACTERS EACH

U GETINFO
FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE

NOT SURE BUT THIS MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS HERE ARE SOME GAMES THAT MY WIFE AND I ENJOY PLAYING TOGETHER

DOMINION ROBINSON CRUSOE RUNEBOUND LORDS OF WATERDEEP MEMOIR MERCHANTS MARAUDERS
YOU MAY ENJOY WONDERS DEUL ONE OF THE BEST 2 PLAYER GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED IT'S A GOOD STRATEGY GAME WITH VERY LITTLE RANDOMNESS JUST A BIT AT THE START BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE MOST OF THE CARDS BEFORE THEY ARE AVAILABLE
SPLENDOR AND WONDERS DUEL
SO WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO CAN HANDLE SOME HEAVIER STUFF WHICH IS GREAT I RECENTLY GOT INTO NEW COOP CARD GAME MARKHAM HORROR CG AND IT IS REALLY FUN IT PLAYS PLAYERS AND HAS A GREAT MIX OF MECHANICAL CHALLENGES AND NARRATIVE STORYTELLING REPLACEABILITY IS NOT AS HIGH AS A MORE TRADITIONAL GAME BUT YOU REALLY DO GET THE SENSE OF GOING THROUGH A STORY ADVENTURE TOGETHER AND AS A CG THEY PUBLISH A NEW SCENARIO EACH MONTH SINCE YOU LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES THIS MAY BE A GOOD PICK FOR YOU
SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL A NICE COOP CARD GAME THAT'S RELATIVELY SMALL AND VERY HARD
NOTHING PERSONAL HAS MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEGOTIATION AND DEALS AND IT HAS THE VERY INTERESTING ELEMENT OF THE FAMILY TREE SONS OF ANARCHY FELT REALLY FLAT FOR US BUT AT LEAST IT'S A SHORTER GAME I WOULD SAY NOTHING PERSONAL IS MUCH BETTER IN ANY CASE
SKULL WOULD BE GOOD IT'S PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE IT HAS THAT FEELING OF OUTWITTING THE OTHER PLAYERS WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING DIRECT CONFLICT OF ANY KIND IT'S ALSO PRETTY SOCIAL BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TRY TO READ THE OTHER PLAYERS BEHAVIOURS IT'S ALSO FAST AND CAN SUPPORT A FAIR LARGE NUMBER OF PLAYERS IF YOU WANT TO TRY IT OUT WITHOUT BUYING THE COMMERCIAL GAME THEN YOU CAN PLAY IT PRETTY EASILY WITH A REGULAR DECK OF PLAYING CARDS POKER CARDS

YOU MAY FIND THE BLUFFING ASPECT WILL APPEAL TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF YOUR CROWD BUT WILL TURN OFF ANOTHER PERCENTAGE I DON'T THINK THIS IS A REASON TO NOT GET IT JUST SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF AND PLAN AROUND SOME PEOPLE JUST FIND IT VERY HARD READING BODY LANGUAGE AND OTHERS FIND IT DIFFICULT BEING DISHONEST EVEN WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A GAME
IF RHINO HERO WORKED WELL THEN I WOULD DEFINITELY SUGGEST GRABBING JUNK ART THAT GAME HAS QUICKLY BECOME MY FAVORITE DEXTERITY GAME

IT MAY SEEM A BIT ODD BUT I COULD DEFINITELY IMAGINE MYSELF AND A BUNCH OF FRIENDS REALLY ENJOYING CODENAMES GROWING UP IT'S DEALING WITH WORDS BUT IT THE GAME IS STILL SO SILLY AND APPROACHABLE THAT I CAN SEE EVEN YEAR OLDS ENJOYING IT YOU MIGHT WANT TO EASE THEM IN WITH CODENAMES PICTURES THOUGH

AND IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A RISK BUT WITH A VERY HIGH REWARD I WOULD GO WITH CAPTAIN SONAR EACH MOVING PIECE IN THE GAME IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE TO GRASP BUT THE GAME BECOMES A BIT HARD FOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY HAVE TO COMBINE THEM ALL WITH WORKING AS A TEAM IT MAY NOT WORK WITH KIDS THAT CAN'T SIT IN THEIR SEATS FOR LONG BUT I CAN DEFINITELY SEE THIS BEING A HIT IF YOU CAN CONVINCE AT LEAST KIDS AND A COUPLE OF ADULTS TO TRY IT OUT AFTER THAT THE REST SHOULD NOTICE HOW INTERESTING IT IS AND FOLLOW ALONG
WHY NOT FIND SOMEONE ON VASSEL OR BG TO DO AN EMAIL GAME OR SOMETHING

OR JUST DO WHAT I DO AND CONSTANTLY RILE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE PLAYING GAMES INTO PLAYING GAMES UNTILL THEY RELENT
IF I WERE YOU I'D TRY TO FIND A BOARD GAMING NEETUP GO A FEW TIMES AND JUST KEEP ASKING IF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED
DO YOU HAVE AN FAGS YOU COULD PUT UP A FLYER OR POST ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA SITES ASKING FOR PLAYERS IF YOU'VE ALREADY SPENT THE MONEY AND YOU'RE JUST ITCHING TO PLAY I'D POINT OUT IN YOUR AD THAT THERE'S NO COST TO PLAY UNLESS YOUR FAGS HAS A TABLE FEE IN WHICH CASE I'D PROBABLY ASK THE GROUP TO SPLIT IT
IT'S NOT THE WORST IDEA EVER THE STORY BOOK AND UNLOCKING AND EXPLORATION THINGS MAY MAKE IT SORT OF INTERESTING

YOU'D LOSE A LOT OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PLAYERS THOUGH IN TERMS OF ENMITY ETC BUT IT MAY BE FUN TO PUT PEOPLE ON VERY DIFFERENT UPGRADE PATHS AND SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT FOR EACH OF THEM
YEAH I AGREE THIS COULD BE FUN BECAUSE THE STORY IS QUITE COOL HOWEVER ADDING TO THE OTHER COMMENTS I WOULDN'T RUN FIVE FACTIONS I THINK WOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH

ONE IDEA YOU COULD DO IS TO PUT ALL OF THE GUILDS ACTIONS INTO A HAT OR A RANDOM GENERATOR SPREADSHEET OR SOMETHING AND EACH TIME YOU CHANGE TO A NEW PROVINCE'S TURN PICK TWO OUT OF THE HAT AND THEN YOU CHOOSE ONE TO DO MAKES IT A BIT MORE CHALLENGING AND ALSO ACTS LIKE AN ACTUAL OTHER PERSON PICKING WHAT THAT GUY IS GOING TO DO
SEE MINUTES ONWARD ON THIS MUSD VIDEO
MAN I KNOW THIS EXACT SAME FEELING I WISH I COULD PLAY WITH YA DUDE
HEY MAN IT'S ALL GOOD I'VE PLAYED PARTIAL GAMES OF WAR OF THE RING WHERE I AM PLAYING BOTH SIDES IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD TIME
YEAH IT'D BE FINE TO DO THAT I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND I SUGGEST DOING AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO ADD IN A FOURTH IN GAME CHECK THE RULES FOR ADDING AND REMOVING PLAYERS YOU COULD EVEN SIDELINE ONE FACTION OR ANOTHER AFTER A BIG DEFEAT FOR ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE PUNCH GOOD LUCK
I'VE ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IF SEAWALL COULD BE PLAYED PURELY SOLO AS A SINGLE PROVINCE AND THEORETICALLY IT CAN BE THERE'S NOTHING THAT REQUIRES YOU TO INTERACT WITH OTHER PLAYERS TO PROGRESS THE MAIN CAMPAIGN SO YOU COULD THEORETICALLY JUST GO AROUND AND DO STUFF UNTIL YOU HIT THE TARGET GLORY IN EACH GAME

YOU COULD ALSO THEORETICALLY PLAY THIS GAME SOLO AS MULTIPLE CHARACTERS THERE'S VERY LITTLE HIDDEN INFORMATION IN THE GAME AND IT COMES LATER IN THE CAMPAIGN AND IS PRETTY MINOR NOTHING IF ALL PLAYERS WERE TO KNOW IT I WOULD RECOMMEND PLAYING AS PROVINCES JUST SO THAT THERE'S LESS BOOK-KEEPING TO KEEP TRACK OF IN YOUR HEAD AND TO MAKE GAMES A LITTLE SHORTER
MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH JUST GATHERING UP A LOCAL GROUP OF STRANGERS OR LIKE MINDED GAMERS IS THAT FOR A LEGACY GAME I'D WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEDICATED TOWARDS FINISHING THE CAMPAIGN I'VE SEEN A LOT OF REVIEWS FOR THE GAME WHERE PEOPLE ONLY PLAYED GAMES AND THAT SEEMED TO BE THEIR LIMIT OF THE ENJOYMENT

TRYING TO GATHER UP A DEDICATED GROUP OF GAMERS FOR ANYTHING NOWADAYS IS LIKE PULLING TEETH FROM A LEVIATHAN THAT STAYS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN AND NEVER OPENS IT'S MOUTH

AND MY WORST FEAR WOULD BE STARTING A GAME OF SEAWALL WITH A GROUP OF PLAYERS WHERE THEY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF NAMING SEVERAL COMPONENTS SUCH AS FACTIONS ADVISORS SHIPS AND ISLANDS ONLY TO DECIDE THEY DON'T WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE AFTER GAMES LEAVING SOMEONE ELSE TO PICK UP THE PLACE OF A FACTION THEY DIDN'T GET TO CREATE
I INTERACT WITH MY FRIENDS THAT I'M PLAYING THE GAME WITH
I TALK TO OTHER PLAYERS WE JUST CHAT AND HANG OUT AND WHEN IT ROLLS AROUND TO YOUR TURN YOU DO IT OR WATCH THEIR TURNS AND BE INVOLVED IN THAT WAY DOWNTIME BOTHERS ME THE LEAST OUT OF MY MAIN GROUPS I PLAY IN
I PAY ATTENTION TO OTHER PEOPLE'S TURNS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ACTIONS BECAUSE I FEEL IT IS COURTEOUS I FIND IT VERY AWKWARD WHEN I'M TAKING MY TURN AND NO IS PAYING ATTENTION
MAGE KNIGHT IS DEFINITELY A ONE OR TWO PLAYER GAME THAT LEADS ME TO MY ANSWER WHICH IS THAT I JUST DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH LONG DOWNTIME DOWNTIME IS THE BIGGEST KILLER OF FUN FOR MY BY FAR IF A GAME HAS UNBEARABLE DOWNTIME IT'S GOING ON THE TRADE PILE
OBVIOUSLY AN IDEAL ANSWER IS ENJOY THE COMPANY OF MY FRIENDS WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS IS I EAT ALL THE SNACKS NOT A HEALTHY HABIT
I ONLY PLAY MAGE KNIGHT SOLO I JUST AVOID LARGE PLAYER COUNTS FOR GAMES WITH LONG DOWN TIME

IF YOU MUST PLAY WITH YOU COULD ALWAYS THROW IN FILLER GAMES OR HAVE ANOTHER LONGER GAME RUNNING ON THE SIDE
SEVERAL WAYS

IF I'M AT MY FAGS I GET UP AND WALK AROUND AND SEE WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING

IF I'M AT HOME WITH FRIENDS I JOKE AROUND AND TALK OCCASIONALLY I'LL GET UP AND COOK SOMETHING

IF I'M PLAYING WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE PLAYED THE GAME MANY TIMES I PUSH THEM TO MAKE FASTER TURNS OFTEN TIMES WE WILL ALL AGREE TO PLAY WITH A TIMER
HOURS IS OVER THE TOP HONESTLY THERE IS TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS ANSWERS BUT REALLY FOR EIGHT HOURS MANS HUNGRY AND TIRED BY THEN
I'VE GOTTEN MORE PATIENT OVER TIME BUT THIS STILL KILLS ME AMONG THE GUYS I LIKE TO PLAY HEAVY GAMES WITH WHO ARE ALSO MY FRIENDS A FEW ARE VERY AP PRONE IT CAN MAKE GAMES THAT I WOULD OTHERWISE ENJOY REALLY BORING AND EVEN FRUSTRATING I ALSO JUST KNOW TO TURN DOWN LOTS OF GAMES BECAUSE THE PLAYTIME WILL BE HOURS MORE THAN ADVERTISED

I DO LIKE INTERACTING WITH MY FRIENDS DURING THE DOWNTIME BUT I ALSO WANT WHOSEVER TURN IT IS TO NOT TELL STORIES ETC FINISH YOUR TURN AND THEN REJOIN THE CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S FAIR THAT IF OTHER PEOPLE ARE WAITING TO PLAY YOU SHOULD MAKE AN EFFORT TO AT LEAST NOT GET DISTRACTED ON YOUR TURN I'VE BEEN SCOLDED FOR ASKING PEOPLE TO DO THIS THOUGH
YOUR FIRST MISTAKE WAS PLAYING A FOUR PLAYER GAME OF MAGE KNIGHT HAHA

BUT FOR ME I DON'T LIKE A LOT OF DOWN TIME WHEN I ALREADY KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IF THE TIME BETWEEN TURNS INVOLVES ME PLANNING MY TURN FOR MOST OF IT I'M COOL BUT I DO GET ANNOYED WHEN I'VE FIGURED OUT WHAT I WANT TO DO AND HAVE TO WAIT AWHILE I HAVE ONE FRIEND IN PARTICULAR THAT'S AP PRONE AND IT CAN BECOME BOTHERSOME WE USUALLY TAKE OUT A TIMER IF HE TAKES TOO LONG TO GET HIM MOVING SOMETHING ABOUT IT JUST TAKES ME OUT OF THE GAME

USUALLY DURING THAT DOWNTIME I'LL TALK TO A FRIEND BROWSE REDDIN TEXT SOMEONE WATCH A GAME THAT'S ON TV ETC
WHEN FOLKS ARE STARTING TO TAKE TOO LONG WE SOMETIMES WILL STAND UP DURING OUR TURNS SEEMS TO MOVE THINGS ALONG
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO PICK THE RIGHT GAMES AND TO KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE PERSONALLY I'M FINE WITH ALL BUT THE MOST EXTREME AMOUNT OF DOWNTIME I USED TO PLAY WITH ANOTHER GUY WHO MUST HAVE HAD SEVERE ADAD BECAUSE HE WOULD START SIGHING LOUDLY AND DRUMMING ON THE TABLE DURING ANY GAME WITH MORE THAN A MINUTE OR SO OR DOWNTIME I WOULD TRY AND AVOID CERTAIN GAMES WITH HIM BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD END UP GETTING AWKWARD AND ANNOYING

I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH PLAYER MAGE KNIGHT BUT I WOULD ONLY WANT TO PLAY WITH OTHER LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE IT REALLY IS JUST A MATTER OF GETTING THE RIGHT MIX OF PLAYERS HOURS IS DEFINITELY LONG THOUGH YOU CAN ALWAYS GIVE GENTLE REMINDERS THAT THE WORLD IS NOT RESTING ON THE ABILITY TO PERFECTLY OPTIMIZE A HAND OF CARDS IN MAGE KNIGHT SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO DISCIPLINE AND SELF-AWARENESS TO ACCEPT A SOLUTION THAT YOU KNOW IS NOT PERFECT FOR THE SAKE OF THE TABLE
CHIMING IN WITH THE OTHERS THAT MAGE KNIGHT IS A MISTAKE I THINK THREE IS PLAYABLE BUT ONLY IF EVERYONE IS QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THE GAME OTHERWISE 2 MAX
I HAVEN'T PLAYED MAGE KNIGHT BUT IN GENERAL WHAT I DO IS RUN THROUGH MY STRATEGY HASH OUT DIFFERENT ALTERNATE STRATEGIES DO A LITTLE MATH TO SEE IF DIFFERENT THINGS MIGHT WORK OUT BETTER ETC
THE MOST POLITICALLY CORRECT WAY TO DEAL WITH IT IS THAT FIRST EVERYONE HAVE TO AGREE ON A CERTAIN TIME FRAME FOR EACH TURN SAY MINUTES DURING THE MINUTES NO ONE CAN PERFORM ANY ACTION BESIDES CONTEMPLATION OF MOVES ACTIONS CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED AT EXACTLY MINUTES SO HOPEFULLY PEOPLE FAVOR HIGH DOWN TIME OR LOW DOWN TIME WILL BE A BIT MORE CONSIDERATE
I DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH EXCESSIVE PLAYERS AND I WILL LEAVE IF IT'S A PROBLEM I CAN MAYBE TOLERATE DOWNTIME IF THERE'S TABLE TALK BUT MY FIANCEE ABSOLUTELY CAN'T PUT UP WITH IT

IN ONE OF MY GROUPS THERE ARE TWO GUYS WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HAS COMPONENTS FOR AND IS FUN WITH AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THEY'RE RIDICULOUSLY BAD AT RECOGNIZING WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE BORED I HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO LEAD AN EXODUS WHEN THE PACE IS GETTING OUT OF HAND

IT'S BEEN AN HOUR IS ANYONE CLOSE TO WINNING NO ALRIGHT I THINK THIS IS A GAME MAXIMUM I'M GOING TO SET UP CARCASSONNE AT THAT TABLE AND ANYONE WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME IS WELCOME IF PLAYERS DITCHING EARLY IS A PROBLEM WHICH IT USUALLY ISN'T THE PLAYERS WHO WANT TO FINISH THE GAME TAKE OVER FOR THE EMPTY SEATS IT'S BLUNT BUT IT WORKS AND DOESN'T LEAVE HARD FEELINGS
PLAYING WITH GOOD FRIENDS THAT YOU CAN FREELY JOKE AND JEST WITH DOESN'T EVEN MAKE YOU REALIZE THERE IS A DOWNTIME
SET THE EXPECTATION THAT EVERYBODY TALKS THROUGH ALL OF THEIR TURNS ACTUALLY VERBALIZE EVERY DECISION MADE AND BRING OTHERS INTO YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS I THINK THE REASON PEOPLE GET BORED WHEN IT'S NOT THEIR TURN IS BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING BUT TALKING OUT EVERY PIECE OF THE GAME GIVES EVERYBODY ELSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON WHAT THE ACTING PLAYER SHOULD DO MAKE FUN OF OTHERS WHEN THEY MAKE BAD MOVES KEEPING IT UPBEAT AND IMPERSONAL AS YOUR GROUP MAY NEED AND NEGOTIATE MOVES THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE OTHERS

I GET BORED WHEN I PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE TO TALK OUT THEIR TURNS BUT IF YOU START BY TALKING OUT YOUR TURNS PEOPLE TYPICALLY FOLLOW SUIT AND EVERYBODY HAS A BETTER TIME YEAH THE GAME GETS LESS COMPETITIVE AS YOU NO LONGER HAVE THIS SILENT CALCULATING ADVERSARY ON THE OTHER SIDE BUT IF YOU'RE JUST PLAYING FOR FUN I THINK TALKING A LOT MAKES IT MORE FUN

AND AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THE DOWNTIME IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH MAGE KNIGHT WITH MORE THAN TWO PLAYERS IF YOUR CREW ISN'T UP FOR TALKING THROUGH EVERYTHING AND GETS BORED WATCHING OTHERS TAKE A LONG TIME THEN THAT GAME MIGHT BE REPLACED BY SOMETHING WITH SHORTER TURNS
I WOULD LOVE TO TRY THIS

IF ONLY I COULD GET A GAME GROUP TO USE IT
YOU SET UP ANOTHER GAME OF MAGE KNIGHT ON ANOTHER TABLE AND SWITCH TURN ORDER UP SO WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED ON ONE TABLE IT WILL BE YOUR TURN AT THE NEXT ETC
TYPICALLY WE JUST THROW YUGIOH OR SOMETHING ON HULU GIVES YOU SOMETHING TO DO BUT ISN'T DISTRACTING ENOUGH TO EXACERBATE THE ISSUE
CIVILIZATION THE BOARD GAME IT'S QUITE INTERESTING ME AND MY OLDER BROTHER USED TO PLAY WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER TO KILL A LONG DREARY WEEKEND CAN TAKE A FEW HOURS TO FINISH AND LIKE THE PC GAME YOU ADVANCE YOUR TECHNOLOGIES SLOWLY THROUGH THE GAME HOPE THIS HELPS
GOOD IDEA
GOOD IDEA I WAXED THE BOARD INSTEAD GOT RID OF THE JERKINESS AND HELPS PROTECT THE BOARD
INTERESTING IDEA I'D BE A LITTLE NERVOUS IT WOULD AFFECT THE MAGNET STRENGTH WE ALREADY TEND TO LOSE OUR STRIKER ON HARD SHOTS NOT SURE HOW ADDING MORE DISTANCE WOULD WORK DID YOU FELT THE STEERING MAGNET AS WELL

I WONDER IF SOMEONE COULD CREATE A PAIR OF STRIKER STEERING PIECES FELTED ON BOTH SIDES BUT WITH STRONGER MAGNETS
I GUESS THIN NEOPRENE OLD MOUSE PAD MIGHT WORK TOO
CAN'T REALLY HELP WITH THE REST OF THE STUFF BUT JUST TO THROW MY TWO CENTS IN ABOUT HOGWARTS BATTLE IF YOU REALLY LOVE HARRY POTTER YOU'LL LOVE THIS SOLID DECKBUILDER WITH A LEGACY STYLE SET UP IF YOU ARE EH ABOUT HARRY POTTER I WOULD PASS ON THIS BECAUSE AS A DECKBUILDER IT'S WHEN COMPARED TO GAMES LIKE ASCENSION OR DOMINION STILL A GOOD GAME BUT IF YOU ALREADY OWN ASCENSION OR DOMINION AND THE THEME ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU I WOULD PASS ON IT
MY FOUR-YEAR-OLD AND I PLAY BRANDON THE BRAVE MONZA RHINO HERO LOOPING LOUIE PIE FACE LET'S GO FISHING ANIMAL UPON ANIMAL DANIEL TIGER'S NEIGHBORHOOD GAME CONNECT FOUR GO IN AND VARIOUS MATCHING MEMORY GAMES

THE COOL THING ABOUT FOUR IS THAT THEY'RE FINALLY ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND FOCUS JUST LONG ENOUGH TO LEARN AND ACTUALLY PLAY SIMPLE SHORT GAMES AS OPPOSED TO TAKING TWO TURNS AND LEAVING THE TABLE FRUSTRATED YOU'LL WANT STUFF WITH LOW DOWNTIME FOR EACH PLAYER AT MOST THREE MECHANISMS FOR THEM TO KEEP TRACK OF AND SIMPLE FIRST PAST THE POST GAMEPLAY THE GOAL OF MANY GAMES AT THIS AGE IS SIMPLY TEACHING SPORTSMANSHIP TAKING TURNS PASSING PLAY ACCEPTING ADVERSITY I'LL OFTEN MODIFY GAMES A BIT TO ADJUST FOR THESE PARAMETERS IF THERE'S DOWNTIME I'LL ASK MY BOY TO HELP ME TAKE MY TURN AND TALK THROUGH STRATEGY AND THE FIRST FEW TIMES WE PLAY COMPETITIVE GAMES I'LL DO VERY LITTLE TO IMPEDE HIS SUCCESS IN ORDER FOR HIM TO DEVELOP A FIRM GRASP ON THE PATH TO VICTORY AFTER HE CAN SEE HOW TO WIN THAT'S WHEN I'LL START TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT INTRODUCE ADVERSITY TO CHALLENGE HIM TO ADAPT AND OVERCOME

AS FOR WHICH GAMES YOU AND YOUR OLDER FRIENDS WILL ALSO ENJOY YOU ALMOST CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANYTHING PUBLISHED BY HABA ANY OF THEIR AGES GAMES ARE APPROACHABLE FOR YEAR OLDS AND AT THE VERY LEAST MAKE FUN PARTY DRINKING GAMES AS WELL

SORTING CATEGORIES ON BG BY RANK IS USUALLY A CRAPSHOOT ON IF YOUR GOING TO FIND THE PARAGON OF A PARTICULAR GENRE OR JUST THE FAVORITE BUT CHILDREN'S GAMES IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SOLIDLY STRATIFIED
GO HERE TO SEE WHAT I MEAN

I GOT RHINO HERO FOR MY NIECE AND SHE REALLY LIKES IT I PLAY IT WITH HER EVERY TIME I GO TO VISIT I DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH ANYTHING ELSE I GOT THIS AFTER SEARCHING FOR THE SAME TYPE OF THREADS I THINK IT WAS A GOOD CHOICE
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WHATEVER KIDS GAME YOU BRING INTO THE HOUSE YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN OF THE ONES WE OWN THE ONE I DON'T MIND PLAYING IS SEQUENCE FOR KIDS IT TEACHES TAKING TURNS KEEPING A SECRET HAND MAKING CHOICES AND THERE IS A SPATIAL ELEMENT
MY NIECES LIKE A LOT ROBOT TURTLES AND WE HAVE BEEN PLAYING SINCE THEY WERE YEARS OLD THEY ARE NOW AND A HALF AND WE STILL PLAY FROM TIME TO TIME IT IS A PROGRAMMING GAME WHERE THEY HAVE TO MOVE A TURTLE JOWARS A GEM GIVING INSTRUCTIONS LIKE MOVE FORWARD OR TURN DEGREES WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT MORE COMPLEX CARDS AND ELEMENTS IN THE BOARD THAT YOU CAN START USING ONCE THEY LEARN THE BASICS BOXES THAT CAN BE PUSHED OR ICE TOWERS THAT CAN BE MELTED FOR EXAMPLE

I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND JUNK ARTICLE IT'S A FANTASTIC GAME AND YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO KEEP SCORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MOST OF THE TIME WHEN I PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE WE DROP A LOT OF THE SCORING OR ADDITIONAL RULES AND JUST PLAY UNTIL SOMEONE'S FALLS OVER

THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIANT GAME MODES TOO SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO PLAY I'M SURE IT WOULD BE A HIT
BEST GAME BY FAR FOR A YOUNG GIRL IS SLEEPING QUEENS VERY EASY TO LEARN HAS SOME VERY BASIC MATHEMATICS GREAT TO HELP LITTLE ONES LEARN BASIC ADDITION MY KIDS LOVE IT IT WAS CREATED BY A YR OLD GIRL
動物将棋 ANIMAL SHOGI IT'S A REALLY SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF CHESS
MY KIDS ENJOY LOOPING CHEWIE ANIMAL UPON ANIMAL AND A ROLL AND MOVE GAME CALLED THE GREATEST DAY EVER THERE'S NOT MUCH TO THAT LAST ONE BUT IF IT TEACHES THEM TO LIKE BOARD GAMES I CAN SUPPORT THAT
I GOT MY NIECE HOOT OWL HOOT WHEN SHE WAS THAT AGE BECAUSE IT'S A CO-OP IT REALLY DID WONDERS FOR CURING HER OF THAT WHOLE YOU HAVE TO LET THE KID WIN OR SHE'LL PITCH A FIT THING THAT SO MANY KIDS HAVE WHEN WE WIN OR LOSE AS A FAMILY SHE CAN ACCEPT LOSING MUCH MORE GRACIOUSLY
MY LITTLEST GIRL WILL BE NEXT MONTH

I WILL SECOND THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANIMAL UPON ANIMAL OUTFOXED RHINO HERO

I WOULD ALSO OFFER A SUGGESTION FOR DR EUREKA THIS IS A VISUALIZATION DEXTERITY GAME AND CAN BE FOUND AT TARGET EVENING

TO MITIGATE THE DEXTERITY A BIT FOR HER WE PLAY WHERE MY CAN HANDLE THE COMPONENTS DIRECTLY AND CAN PUT THEM ON THE TABLE WHICH ARE NOT ALLOWED FOR THE OLDER PLAYERS WE DON'T REALLY LET HER WIN THOUGH
LABYRINTH
THERE'S EVEN A LABYRINTH JR BUT THE ORIGINAL IS JUST FINE TOO
MY OLD BOY ENJOYS CARCASSONNE KING OF TOKYO MAGIC LABYRINTH DAYS ROLL FOR IT LAS VEGAS NO THANKS AND HAS JUST STARTED PLAYING SPLENDOR

HAVING READ ALL OF THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS WE'RE ALSO GOING TO GET HIM OUTFOXED AND ANIMAL UPON ANIMAL FOR XMAS TO GO WITH HEY THAT'S MY FISH AND PITCHCAR THAT WE'VE ALREADY BOUGHT HIM
GIVE ARCHIPELAGO A LOOK FOR A FUN THEMATIC UROSTYLE GAME ZOMBICIDE BP AND CONAN SIMPLE RULES BUT BAD RULEBOOK ARE GREAT FOR NOT SO SERIOUS FUN WITH SOME GREAT COMPONENTS MAYBE LOOK UP BLOOD RAGE AS WELL IF YOU WANT SOME MORE COMPETITIVE ANIS LAST WILL ALSO HAS A GREAT THEME THAT SHOULD KEEP PEOPLE INTERESTED SHOULD BE CHEAPER THAN THE OTHER STUFF I MENTIONED
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY HAS A GOOD SPACE THEME THE LARGE AMOUNT OF DICE GET OTHERS INTRIGUED AND THE ART IS GOOD I'VE PLAYED IT TIMES AND ALREADY KNOW ALL THE RULES AND HAVE TAUGHT IT TWICE BOTH TIMES TOOK MINS TO EXPLAIN
EASIEST GAME I KNOW WITH A BIT OF DEPTH WOULD BE COLORETTO

IF YOU DONT MIND HANAFI HAS A LOT OF DEPTH FOR A SIMPLE RULE SET

CONCORDIA S RULE BOOK IS PAGES LONG I BELIEVE AND IS AN AMAZING EURO

IF YOU WANT TO GO EVEN DEEPER I HAVE NEVER HAD PROBLEMS EXPLAINING POWER GRID TO PEOPLE THOUGH I GUESS THIS GAME LOOKS AS BORING AS ANY GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN


RAIDERS OF THE NORTH SEA IT LOOKS VERY APPEALING AWESOME COMPONENT QUALITY HAS REAL COINS REALLY BRILLIANT ARTWORK WITH VIBRANT COLORS AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD GAME IT'S MY FAVORITE OF THE GENRE

I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO MIGHT DESCRIBE IT AS LIGHT-WEIGHT DEPENDS ON YOUR TASTES JUDGING BY THE OTHER GAMES YOU LISTED I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD FIT
CONCORDIA JUST DON'T SHOW THEM THE BOX COVER

EMET NOT THAT HARD TO EXPLAIN BUT MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS A REFERENCE SHEET OF THE POWER TILES

ABOVE BELOW LOOKS GORGEOUS BUT ALSO HAS STORY ELEMENT WITH THE STORYBOOK IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT THE STRATEGY

LORDS OF WATERDEEP MANY NON GAMER FRIENDS ENJOYED IT FOR MORE DEPTH THE EXPANSION IS A MUST

MIKAL THE NEW REPRINT COMING OUT THIS DECEMBER BY SUPER STEEPLE SAME PUBLISHER AS MEXICA WITH THE SAME GREAT COMPONENT QUALITY

EVOLUTION CLIMATE GREAT ARTWORK GREAT GAMEPLAY EASY TO TEACH AND TONS OF DEPTH
LEWIS CLARK
ROKOKO
COAL BARON
IMPERIAL SETTLERS
AMONG THE STARS
JUNK ART AND IMHOTEP ARE MY GO RIGHT NOW QUALITY COMPONENTS ARE TOP NOTCH AND A BREEZE TO TEACH IMHOTEP IS JUST SOLID ENTRY LEVEL GOOD A BIT ON THE DRAB SIDE BUT LESS IS MORE HERE
MANHATTAN PROJECT IS A VERY NICE MID WEIGHT INTRODUCTION TO WORKER PLACEMENT CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG IS ANOTHER LIGHTER MID WEIGHT GAME WITH INTERESTING THEME AND COMPONENTS THAT ATTRACT NEW PLAYERS ROLL FOR THE GALAXY FOR THOSE WHO WANT SOMETHING A LITTLE HEAVIER
CHECK OUT SCYTHE IT LOOKS INTERESTING THE COMPONENTS ARE BEAUTIFUL THE ARTWORK IS STUNNING AND IT'S MID WEIGHT STRATEGY WITH SOME COMBAT I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE
CRY HAVOC IF THEY THINK IT LOOKS BORING YOU NEED NEW FRIENDS LOL
IF YOU DON'T MIND A TV LICENSED GAME THEN SPARTACUS A GAME OF BLOOD AND TREACHERY BY GALE FORCE MIGHT BE WORTH CHECKING OUT YOU PLAY AS A DOMINUS AN OWNER OF GLADIATORS AND MANAGE YOUR STABLE OF GLADIATORS AGAINST OTHERS YOU FIGHT YOUR GLADIATORS IN AN ARENA KILL OFF YOUR FOES RECRUIT STRONGER GLADIATORS AND GENERALLY TRY TO SCREW YOUR OPPONENT CHECK IT OUT AND SEE IF IT INTERESTS YOU
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT ARENA OF LEGENDS IS AN ABSTRACT GLADIATOR THEMED GAME YES I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CONTRADICTORY LOL IT KINDA IS SPELL SLINGING BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY PLAYERS HAVE SPECIALIZED DECKS OF MONSTERS THAT THEY SUMMON INTO THE BOARD FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEY'RE SUMMONED BY PLACING TOKENS THAT MATCH THE PATTERN ON THE CARDS THE GOAL IS TO FINISH OBJECTIVES THOUGH THE FIGHTS THEMSELVES ARE SECONDARY
YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE HOPLOMACHOS SERIES
IF YOU DON'T MIND A MORE ABSTRACT GAME YOU COULD TRY COLOSSAL ARENA IT'S A CARD GAME WHERE CREATURES ARE BATTLING IN WELL AN ARENA EVERY ROUND PLAYERS PLACE COMBAT CARDS ON CREATURES AND EVENTUALLY ONE CREATURE GETS KNOCKED OUT PLAYERS ARE TRYING TO PLACE BETS ON THE CREATURES THAT WILL SURVIVE UNTIL THE END I USE THE TERM BATTLING LOOSELY BECAUSE IT'S VERY ABSTRACT IT IS A GOOD GAME WITH AND AS A BONUS IT'S QUITE CHEAP

EDIT PRICE HAS GONE UP FOR THIS GAME NOT SURE WHY COULD BE OUT OF PRINTING
SPARTACUS BLOOD IN THE SAND IS A LOT OF FUN IT'S MORE INTRIGUE AND BACK STABBING WITH A BIT OF GLADIATORIAL FIGHTING THROWN IN BUT IT'S VERY THEMATIC
GORECHOSEN IS A BLAST WHO CARES IF IT IS WARHAMMER IT'S A BRASHEST AND THE MINIS LOOK GREAT
HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO KASHIMA LEGEND OF THE KAMI MASTERS IT'S GOT THE BRAWLING YOU MIGHT BE JOINERING FOR

BOARDGAME
TRY ULTIMATE WARRIOR
GLADIATORISM IS CURRENTLY ON KICKSTARTER IT SEEMS IT WOULD FIT YOUR DESCRIPTION GIVE IT A LOOK
I'VE ENJOYED CLASH OF THE GLADIATORS QUITE A BIT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME YOU DRAFT DIFFERENT MEMBERS TO YOUR SQUADS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE SQUADS GO AROUND FIGHTING OTHER SQUADS OR NPC ANIMALS UNTIL THERE'S ONLY PLAYER LEFT I REALLY LIKE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT GLADIATOR POWERS AND THEY FEEL VERY THEMATIC WHICH ENHANCES THE EXPERIENCE NICELY
DUEL OF AGES II

IT'S A WILD TEAM VS TEAM COMBAT GAME IN A CRAZY HUNGER GAMES STYLE ARENA

COULD BE JUST WHAT YOU'RE AFTER
I HAD BEEN EYEING ARENA REX AWHILE AGO A BIT OF A CASH SINK INITIALLY BUT COULD BE REALLY COOL IF YOU HAVE A GROUP DOWN FOR IT
BATTLETOWN IS A BEAUTIFUL FIGHTING GAME MODELED AFTER THE CLASSIC 2D FIGHTING GAMES LIKE STREET FIGHTER EACH PLAYER HAS A COMMON SET OF BASE MOVES THEN A SET OF STYLES UNIQUE TO THEIR CHARACTER AS WELL AS A UNIQUE ABILITY EACH TURN BOTH PLAYERS CHOOSE A MOVE STYLE PAIR THEN SIMULTANEOUS REVEAL AND RESOLVE ATTACK PAIRS HAVE A 2 TURN COOL DOWN YOU ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOUR OPPONENT HAS AND THERE ARE NO DICE HALF THE GAME IS UNDERSTANDING HOW TO PLAY EACH OF THE LARGELY REALLY COOL AND UNIQUE CHARACTERS THE OTHER HALF IS ANTICIPATING YOUR OPPONENTS MOVES AND CHOOSING ACCORDINGLY WITH PERFECT INFORMATION YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BLAME FOR LOSING BUT YOURSELF I JUST ACQUIRED THIS GAME AND FELL IN LOVE

NOT EXACTLY GLADIATORS BUT IT IS 2 PEOPLE OR OR A FEW OTHER VARIANTS BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF EACH OTHER IN AN ARENA
IF YOU WANT ADDITIONAL SCHEMING TRADING PARTNERING AND BETRAYING TRY SPARTACUS

IF YOU WANT JUST A PURE GLADIATORIAL EXPERIENCE LOOK AT HOPLOMACHOS
DUEL OF AGES 2

GOLEM ARCANA HETP
YOU'RE GOING TO SERIOUSLY HAVE TO WORK OUT THE COST OF SHIPPING VS THE COST OF GAMES THERE IS A LINE WHEN YOU SHOULD YOUR GAMES FOR THE SAME COST IF YOU'RE TALKING WITH A COUPLE MONTHS TO SPARE SELL YOUR COLLECTION AND TREAT IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY
CHECK THE MAXIMUM DIMENSIONS OF CHECKED BAGGAGE WITH YOUR AIRLINE EVEN PAYING FOR EXTRA CHECKED BAGGAGE IS USUALLY CHEAPER THAN SHIPPING INTERNATIONALLY GET A DISH BARREL BOX FROM HAUL THEY ARE AND CAN BE CUT DOWN TO THE PROPER DIMENSIONS THEY ARE VERY STRONG BOXES GOOD LUCK

UNFORTUNATELY YOU'RE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR BOTH WEIGHT AND SIZE THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT THE FIRST BUT THE SECOND CAN BE HELPED BY ELIMINATING AS MUCH EMPTY SPACE IN YOUR GAME BOXES AS POSSIBLE LIKE STUFFING SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR AROUND YOUR DICE AND MEEDLESS KIND OF SPACE MANAGEMENT ANY STUFF THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE GOING BACK HOME ANYWAY WORK IT INTO YOUR GAME BOX AND SORT IT OUT ONCE IT ARRIVES AT THE DESTINATION
I DON'T BUT IF YOU FIND OUT I'D LOVE TO KNOW

I LIVE IN JAPAN AND FREQUENTLY HAVE MY FAMILY SHIP GAMES TO ME FROM WHAT WE'VE FOUND THE POST OFFICE EXPENSIVE AS IT IS HAS GIVEN US THE CHEAPEST QUOTES THUS FAR

IF YOU FIND DIFFERENTLY PLEASE LET ME KNOW
I'M IN MALAYSIA AND DUE TO OUR CURRENCY BEING WEAK AF GAMES ARE TOO EXPENSIVE WHEN IT USED TO BE AFFORDABLE
SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW TOO

BEST I CAN THINK OF IS IF YOU HAVE A PILOT FRIEND WHO FLIES FREQUENTLY TO AMERICA AND TO WHERE YOU ARE

I'M STILL HOPING TO FIND THAT FRIEND
IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF STUFF TO SEND HOME YOU COULD ASK YOUR NEW EMPLOYER TO PAY FOR A SHIPPING CONTAINER TO BE SHIPPED THE DOWN SIDE IS THAT IT'S VERY SLOW IT GOES BY SEA BUT YOU CAN SEND QUITE A LOT OF GOODS HOME IN SUCH A CONTAINER
MY WIFE AND I ARE GIANT ALHAMBRA FANS WE OWN AND LOVE THE BIG BOX

HERE'S THE THING THE EXPANSIONS ARE DEFINITELY A MIXED BAG SOME OF THEM IN OUR OPINION ARE ESSENTIAL LIKE DIAMONDS AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE MORE FLAVOR CHANGES THAN MECHANICAL NECESSITIES SOME ARE DEFINITELY BETTER THAN OTHERS WE HAVEN'T ENCOUNTERED ANY THAT WE THINK ARE UNPLAYABLE OR OUTRIGHT BAD JUST DIFFERENT FLAVORS

BASE ALHAMBRA IS A GREAT GAME BUT THE EXPANSIONS IN THE BIG BOX ADD SO MUCH VARIETY KEEP SOMETHING IN MIND TOO EACH NUMBERED EXPANSION ACTUALLY CONSISTS OF FOUR EXPANSION MODULES THAT CAN BE MIXED AND MATCHED AT WILL WHICH ACTUALLY MEANS YOU'RE GETTING TWENTY EXPANSIONS NOT JUST FIVE

FOR BASE ALHAMBRA IS A SCREAMING DEAL FOR THE BIG BOX IS IMO WORTH EVERY PENNY IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY THE BASE GAME AND END UP WANTING EXPANSIONS LATER BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING WRONG EITHER WAY
NOT ALL EXPANSIONS ARE EQUAL IN ALHAMBRA BUT THERE IS A LOT TO LIKE IN THEM ONCE YOU GET FAMILIAR WITH THE BASE GAME I REVIEWED A FEW OF THEM ON MY BLOG A FEW YEARS BACK


YOU COULD TRY GETTING THE APP AND PLAYING THAT A FEW TIMES IT'S WELL IMPLEMENTED AND WOULD GIVE YOU A FEEL WHETHER YOU WOULD GET BORED WITH THE BASE GAME OR NOT IT WON'T TELL YOU IF YOU'D LIKE THE EXPANSIONS BUT IT WILL LET YOU KNOW ABOUT BASE A BIT BETTER

PERSONALLY I ENJOY A NUMBER OF THE EXPANSIONS AND THINK THE BIG BOX IS A GOOD IDEA
MY WIFE AND I LOVE ALHAMBRA I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF PLAY IN THE BASE GAME BEFORE YOU GET BORED OF IT

I PERSONALLY FIND THE EXPANSIONS UNINTERESTING OR A HINDERANCE TO PLAY OTHERS LOVE THEM THE ONLY ONE I KEEP IN PLAY IS THE MAGIC BUILDINGS BUT THAT IS FAR FROM NEEDED
I PLAYED ALHAMBRA BASE A FEW TIMES AT A FRIEND'S PLACE THEN DECIDED TO BUY THE BIG BOX FOR MYSELF MY VERDICT YOU CAN PLAY THE BASE GAME WITHOUT EVER NEEDING TO HAVE AN EXPANSION

THAT BEING SAID I HAVE NO REGRETS BUYING THE BIG BOX GOT IT FOR THO

EXPANSIONS INTEREST DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU LIKE OR DON'T EACH EXPANSIONS HAVE MANY VARIANTS AND STUFF THEY ARE ALL MIXABLE EVEN IF PLAYING ALL OF THEM MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A GOOD IDEA ALL IN ALL I'D SAY THAT UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY A FAN OF THE GAME YOU CAN SKIP THE EXPANSIONS

HOPE THAT HELPED
THANKS EVERYONE FOR YOUR INSIGHT I'LL HOLD OUT AND HOPE I GET THE BASE GAME DELIVERED BUT KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR A HOLIDAY SALE INVOLVING THE BIG BOX SEEMS LIKE EITHER WAY YOU CAN'T GO WRONG
I WOULD AGREE THAT STARTING WITH THE BASE GAME WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA SINCE YOU DON'T EVEN NECESSARILY KNOW THAT YOU'LL LOVE IT IF YOU DO YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE CERTAIN ASPECTS FINANCIAL MARKET OR WHATEVER THEN YOU CAN RESEARCH AND GET EXPANSION S THAT ADD ON TO THAT ASPECT ALSO ADDING AN EXPANSION NOW AND THEN WILL KEEP THE GAME FRESH AND REDUCE THE CHANCES OF BEING OVERWHELMED BY SO MANY EXPANSIONS YOU CAN'T DECIDE WHICH TO USE WHICH SOMETIMES HAPPENS
I DONT KNOW BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWER
PLAY A PRACTICE GAME WITH THE MY FIRST GAME SETUP PRESIDENT BOMBER BLUE TEAM RED TEAM TO MAKE UP THE PLAYER COUNT GAMBLER IF YOU'VE GOT AN ODD NUMBER OF PLAYERS PLAY ROUNDS WITH HOSTAGE PER ROUND FOR EACH GAME AFTER THAT PLAY WITH THE FULL ROUNDS AND APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF TRANSFERS

IF PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH HOW THE GAME PLAYS MOVE ON TO MY FIRST COLOR SHARE PRESIDENT BOMBER DOCTOR ENGINEER RED AND BLUE COY BOYS NEGOTIATORS AND SPIES AND AGAIN FILLING UP NUMBERS WITH VANILLA BLUE TEAM RED TEAM GAMBLER

AFTER THAT YOU WANT TO READ THE ROOM A BIT IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING A BIT MPH WITH THE WHOLE RED BLUE THING AND WANT THERE TO BE OTHER FACTIONS ADD SOME GREY ROLES SNIPER TARGET DECOY IS A GOOD THREE-CARD SET THE PAIRS OF AHAB MOBY ROMEO JULIET MAID BUTLER AND WIFE MISTRESS ARE ALL GOOD FOR THAT TOO IF PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE MORE SCOPE FOR STRATEGY TRY THE RED BLUE AMBASSADORS BOUNCERS OR SECURITY ARE GOOD AS ARE THE ONES CONNECTED WITH CONDITIONS LIKE THE SHY GUY COY BOYS AND PARANOID SIMILARLY FOR THE GREYS THERE ARE THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR REQUIRES YOU TO TEACH ABOUT BURYING SO YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO ADD THE BACK-UP ROLES OF PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER NURSE MARTYR AND TINKER AND MI6 IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING INTO THE FUN OF THINGS AND WANT A SILLY GAME GIVE THEM SOME ACTING ROLES LIKE MIMES AND CLOWNS AND THE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ROLES OF HOT POTATO AND LEPRECHAUN OR EVEN DR BOOM AND THE SATURDAY KNIGHT IF YOU DON'T MIND THE CHANCE THE GAME COULD END SECONDS IN
MY FRIEND USED TO TEACH THIS GAME QUITE FREQUENTLY ONE TIME WITH THE DESIGNER IN TOW WE NEVER DID ANYTHING MORE BASIC THAN PRESIDENT BOMBER DOCTOR ENGINEER AND SHY GUYS CRIMINAL AND PSYCHIATRIST WERE OFTEN USED IN SECOND GAME FOLLOWED BY SPIES
LOOK AT THE PUBLISHERS WEBSITE THEY HAVE EXAMPLE SETS
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO WITH GET ASSASSIN PICKED FIRST TURN THAN I'D KEEP THEM AS SECRET ACHIEVEMENTS IT WOULD BE PRETTY LAME TO CREATE ALL THESE AND SOMEONE JUST INTENTIONALLY GIVES AN OBVIOUS CLUE THAT LEADS TO THE ASSASSIN JUST FOR THE CHIEVE
CODENAMES

FOUR SCORE GIVE A FOUR CARD CLUE AND HAVE YOUR TEAM MATES GUESS ALL

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM

MASTER SMUGGLER SEEK THRU FOUR CONTRABAND CARDS IN ONE ROUND
I FEEL A FUNNY SPLENDOR GAME COULD INVOLVE ONE PLAYER WITH ALL THE NOBLES PERHAPS MORE ABSURD WOULD BE ALL NOBLES AND LOSING TAKEN TO THE EXTREME ALL NOBLES IN A PLAYER GAME WITH NO OTHER POINTS EXACTLY NEEDED TO TRIGGER THE END OF THE GAME AND LOSING BUT I THINK YOU'D HAVE TO COOPERATIVELY TRY TO CAUSE THAT TO HAPPEN

WITH NO TREASURER IN YOUR DECK THIEVES WERE DOING A NUMBER ON ONE PLAYER THEY WERE DOWN TO LIKE TREASURE BUT MOSTLY GOLD AND MULTIPLE ADVENTURERS GOT THEM TO ENOUGH PROVINCES TO WIN

DOMINION COOP EVERY CURSE NONE IN THE SUPPLY OR ANY DECKS

WITHOUT LOOKING AT YOUR CARDS MAYBE SOME SORT OF ALLOWANCE TO CHECK WHEN CALLED BULLSHIT ON AND MUST CHOOSE TO EXCHANGE RANDOMLY NEXT ROUND IF FORCED TO LOOK I TOTALLY PLAY LIKE THIS AFTER A COUPLE DRINKS

I'M NOT CREATIVE ENOUGH FOR FANCY NAMES I JUST LIKE ABSURD BOARD STATES
SOME THINGS FIT THE DIGITAL WORLD AND SOME THE ANALOG ONE THIS KIND OF THING SUCKS FOR ANALOG GAMING
WHY


IS IT JUST ME OR DOES IT SEEM LIKE THE OFFERINGS FOR BOARDGAME KICKSTARTERS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY SATURATED WITH GARBAGE OTHER THAN THE WELL-ESTABLISHED STALWARTS LIKE CMON TINY EPIC ET CETERA ALMOST EVERY CAMPAIGN SEEMS LIKE CRAP OFTEN IT FEELS LIKE OF THE CAMPAIGNS ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO BE EDGY AND HIP AND SOMEHOW END UP AS THE SECOND COMING OF CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY
I THINK I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO PASS ON TINY EPIC QUEST THE GAMEPLAY SEEMS A LITTLE AND THINGS LIKE FULFILLING QUESTS VIA POSITIONING SEEMS SOMEWHAT I ALSO DON'T LIKE THAT THE GAME REQUIRES A HUGE AMOUNT OF TABLE SPACE WHICH SOMEWHAT DEFEATS THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF HAVING A PORTABLE GAME WHICH YOU CAN BRING ANYWHERE

EDIT WHY THE DOWNVOTES ARE WE NOT ALLOWED TO DISCUSS THE DOWNSIDES TO POPULAR KICKSTARTERS AM I NOT APPROPRIATELY CONTRIBUTING TO THE CONVERSATION
BACKING TINY EPIC QUEST MY FIRST TINY EPIC GAME I WISH THEY COULD HAVE POSTED MORE UPDATES DURING THE CAMPAIGN THIS ONE WAS A OH YEAH I AM BACKING THAT ONE AS WELL EVERY TIME I VISITED KICKSTARTER

I HAVE HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS TINY EPIC SERIES AND WHILE I DID NOT BACK GALAXY I WILL GIVE THIS ONE A TRY EVEN IF I DON'T END UP ENJOYING THE GAME I WILL BE ABLE TO USE THE MEEDLESS IN OTHER GAMES USING THE GEAR TO SHOW THEM OFF A BIT BETTER


MYTHIC BATTLES PANTHEON IS STILL THE CAMPAIGN THAT I AM ENJOYING THE MOST THE AMAZING MODELS HIGH QUALITY MODELS IN THE CORE PLEDGE ALONE AND A GREAT EXAMPLE ON HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR BACKERS AND FANS LEONIDAS WHO IS ONE OF THE DESIGNERS OF THE GAME HAVE DONE SEVERAL LIVE STREAMS ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND TALKING ABOUT THE GAME FEATURES AND MUCH MORE AND QUIRKWORTHY IS IN THE COMMENT SECTION HOURS PER DAY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS WELL GREAT WAY OF GETTING THE COMMUNITY FOR YOUR GAME OFF TO A GOOD START


I SHALL SEE IF I CAN GET QUIRKWORTHY OR LEONIDAS TO DO AN AMA HERE ON BOARDGAMES BEFORE THE CAMPAIGN FOR MYTHIC BATTLES PANTHEON IS OVER
YŌKAI QUEST LOOKS COOL I'M MAXED OUT ON MINIATURE CO-OP GAMES THOUGH
THE LOLWUTS ARE PRETTY LOLWUT THIS WEEK ANYTHING LOOKING GOOD TO ANYONE I'M STOKED FOR TEA TINY EPIC WESTERN IS AMAZING AND IT FEELS LIKE THESE GAMES JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER
OF THESE I HAVE BACKED ONLY TWO TINY EPIC QUEST ALTHOUGH I THINK THEY ARE MAKING A RATHER BIG FUSS ABOUT THE MEEDLESS AND LEGENDS UNTOLD


I'M INTERESTED IN SHADOWSCAPE BUT I'M A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOW AMOUNT OF ENEMIES ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS
LISBOA LOOKS GREAT AND I BACKED THE RETAIL VERSION OF FEUDUM BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL KEEP BACKING IT BECAUSE THE CURRENTLY REVEALED STRETCH GOALS SEEM VERY WEIRD TO ME AND THE EXPANSIONS SEEM TO OFFER VERY LITTLE
JUST A QUICK CORRECTION FOR TRICKSTERS THOSE AMOUNTS LISTED ARE IN MEXICAN PESOS MX NOT US DOLLARS
FIRST TIME BACKING ANYTHING BUT I HAVE GONE BALLS DEEP INTO MYTHIC BATTLES PANTHEON ALSO NOT ENTIRELY SURE IF I SHOULD BOTHER WITH TINY EPIC QUEST OR NOT I WILL PROBABLY KEEP IT BACKED JUST WORRIED IT WONT BE THAT FUN MAYBE
ABANDON PLANET IS FROM THE CREATOR OF THE RESISTANCE AVALON

I PLAYED THIS AT PAX AND THIS IS THE GAME I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT IN VERY BACKSTABBED FUN
I HAD BACKED MEGA MAN PIXEL TACTICS AND CANCELED MY PLEDGE I FIGURED IF ANY TYPE OF GAME WAS GOING TO BLOW THROUGH ITS STRETCH GOALS A MEGA MAN GAME WOULD SO FAR THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE OF UNLOCKED

IT'S ACTUALLY MAKING ME NOT WANT IT TO KNOW I WON'T GET A FULL SET OF EXTRA CHARACTERS I'D RATHER JUST INCREASE MY PLEDGE BUCKS AND BUY THE FULL SET AS THE STRETCH GOALS BASICALLY MAKE A THIRD SET OF CARDS
I REALLY WANT TO BACK ME MYSELF AND ICE CREAM JUST TO PUT MY DOG IN THE GAME
COFFEE DICE BOURNEMOUTH WILL BE THE FIRST NON GAME I'M BACKING

MET THEM AT STABCON IN SOUTHAMPTON RECENTLY AND WAS BLOWN AWAY HOW GOOD THEY WERE AT TEACHING GAMES NOT SURE HOW OFTEN I'LL MAKE IT DOWN TO THE CAF BUT WANT TO SUPPORT THEM AS IT WILL BE GREAT FOR THE COMMUNITY
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT FUNDED BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR THAT KID THAT CREATED GUNSHIP WITH HIS DAD
I HOPE YOU GUYS CHECK OUT DOUG DOUG GOOSE CABOOSE I'M SUPER HAPPY TO BE PUBLISHING IT IT'S GREAT FOR CONVENTIONS WORK MEETINGS WITH NEW PEOPLE GAME METUMPS ETC

THE INCREDIBLE KWANCHAI DID THE ART FOR IT SO IT'S BEAUTIFUL AS WELL

I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
I BACKED TINY EPIC QUEST AND MINUTE DUNGEON NOTHING ELSE REALLY STANDS OUT TO ME
JOKAI QUEST ALL THE WAY
REALLY PLEASED THAT THE FOREST DRAGON CARD GAME FUNDED SO QUICKLY

SEEMS LIKE A FUN LITTLE GAME AND GREAT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE ADVENTURE THAT THE TWO BOYS ARE HAVING WITH THEIR DAD I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO PLAYING IT WITH ASSORTED DEICES AND NEPHEWS AND TELLING THEM HOW THE GAME CAME INTO BEING HOPEFULLY INSPIRE ANOTHER GENERATION OF DESIGNERS AND GAMERS
MYTHIC BATTLES PANTHEON LOOKS GREAT AND I'D HAVE A BLAST PAINTING IT BUT ALL THE OPTIONAL BUT EXCLUSIVES ARE REALLY TURNING ME OFFICIAL
JOKAI QUEST AND LEGENDS UNTOLD BOTH LOOK REALLY INTERESTING ILL BE KEEPING MY EYE ON BOTH OF THEM
ANYONE ELSE CLOSE TO BACKING OR ACTUALLY BACKING LEGENDS UNTOLD LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A LOT OF FUN
IS IT JUST ME OR IS SOCIAL LUBRICATION ONE OF THE WORST IDEAS FOR A GAME EVER
HEY THANKS FOR THE MENTION SOCIAL LUBRICATION CARD GAME IS AND IS NOW FUNDED CHECK OUT THE VIDEO FOR FUN BUT PLEASE DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME AT WORK OR WITH YOUR FAMILY
NO IDEA ON OTV BUT COSMIC ENCOUNTER QUANTUM TINY EPIC GALAXIES WOULD ALL LOOK GREAT ON SAID MAT
OTV IS GOOD THE RULE BOOK CAN BE IMPROVED BUT OVERALL IT PLAYS WELL IT IS OFTEN ON SALE AT IN UK THOUGH SO I PERSONALLY THINK IS TOO HIGH
ONWARD DOES A FEW THINGS THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING IT IS REALLY THEMATIC AND THE CONFLICTS IN THE GAME CAN BE REALLY FUN TO GO THROUGH BUT I'VE ONLY REALLY PLAYED IT ONCE AT 2 PLAYERS I FEEL LIKE THAT GAME WOULD REALLY SHINE WITH MORE SEEMS LIKE A DECENT PRICE I PICKED IT UP AT WHICH IS THE PRICE I SEE IT NORMALLY AT
I THREW ALL MINE IN THE TRASH
FIRST EDITION IS THE BETTER FOR ME BUT I ENJOYED THE ONE VERSUS MANY ASPECT AND DISLIKE APPS IF YOU DON'T THINK YOU'LL USE IT YOU COULD DONATE IT TO A GAME CAFE AS SPARES
I MUCH MUCH PREFER 1ST ED TO 2ND EDWARD I MOVED MOUNTAINS TO BUY A 1ST EDITION CORE SET AND DID ARCHAEOLOGY TO FIND BUY THE EXPANSIONS

IF YOU REALLY DON'T NEED IT I SUGGEST SELL IT YOU'LL GET A VERY GOOD PRICE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ARE LOOKING FOR IT
DEVIANT ROBOT AN AWESOME WEBSITE COVERING THE VERY BEST AND WORST OF MOVIES VIDEO GAMES COMICS AND GENERAL GEEK CULTURE

YES YOU CAN

THE RULES SAY TAKE FROM ANY COLONY NOT ANY HOME WORLD

IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SOME OF THE RACES AS WELL AMOEBA COMES TO MIND
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PLAYER A GETS TO ATTACK PLAYER B HE POINTS TO A PLANET WHERE PLAYER B HAS NO SHIPS BUT PLAYER C HAS SHIP OVER THERE

PLAYER B HAS ATTACK CARDS IN VALUE RIGHT
DOES PLAYER C HAVE TO DEFEND I DON'T THINK SO RIGHT

WHAT HAPPENS

IS THERE A PLAYER AID TO EXPLAIN THIS GAME BETTER I TRIED IT SEVERAL TIMES NOW AND I THINK IT'S PRETTY HARD TO EXPLAIN WHILE IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE GAME JUST SO MANY SMALL RULES HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED EXPLAINING THE FLARES AND TECH CARDS
WE ALWAYS PLAYED IT AS YOU CAN PULL FROM WHEREVER NOT THE WARP OBVIOUSLY TO FILL OUT OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE ALLY SO LONG AS YOU LEAVE SHIP TO MAINTAIN THE COLONY
I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS SINCE I'VE ONLY BEEN PLAYING COSMIC FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLAYING FOR YEARS BUT I'VE ALREADY HAD TO TEACH A LOT OF PEOPLE HOW TO PLAY BECAUSE IT INSTANTLY BECAME MY MOST POPULAR GAME SO I THINK MY INPUT IS VERY VALID HERE CONSIDERING THAT I RECENTLY SUCCESSFULLY DID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO

FIRST DON'T START WITH THE REWARDS DECK USE IT DURING YOUR SECOND OR PREFERABLY THIRD GAME TRUST ME THE GAME IS STILL GREAT WITHOUT IT AND A LOT OF THE CARDS IN THE REWARDS DECK CAN BE CONFUSING EVEN IF YOU HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE GAME ALREADY I'M LOOKING AT YOU INTIMIDATES

SECOND I'D SUGGEST USING FLARES IF YOU AS THE GAME TEACHER HAVE A VERY CONFIDENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULES INTERACTIONS AND PHASES ETC WE PLAYED OUR FIRST GAME WITHOUT THEM THOUGH SINCE NONE OF US HAD PLAYED BEFORE AND IT WORKED VERY WELL I'VE FOUND THAT IF SOMEONE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ONE THEY JUST DON'T USE IT

THIRD I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING OUT THE RED ALIENS FOR YOUR FIRST GAME AND POSSIBLY DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO CURATE DOWN THE REMAINING ALIENS TO ONES THAT YOU UNDERSTAND CLEARLY AND THINK WILL INTERACT WELL WHILE PLAYING THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF AVAILABLE IN THE GAME IT'S FINE TO TEMPORARILY REMOVE SOME OF IT AS YOU SEE FIT

FOURTH I THINK POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE GAME AND ALSO THE MOST CONFUSING ASPECT FOR NEW PLAYERS IS HOW THE DIFFERENT PHASES WORK AND INTERACT I'D RECOMMEND ACTUALLY ANNOUNCING EACH NEW PHASE AS IT APPEARS FOR MOST OF THE FIRST TIME AROUND THE TABLE AND SHOWING PLAYERS HOW TO FOLLOW ALONG AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR ALIEN SHEET

ALSO MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN REWARDS AND COMPENSATION THAT SHIT IS REAL CONFUSING FOR THE FIRST MINUTES
MAKE SURE THAT YOUR GROUP IS OK WITH WORKING TOGETHER THEN MAKE SURE YOUR GROUP IS OK AND DOESN'T HOLD ANY GRUDGES WHEN THEY'RE STABBED IN THE BACK IF YOU FIND THAT GROUP THIS GAME IS GOLDEN

I WOULD RECOMMEND PLAYING WITHOUT THE OPTIONAL CARDS THE ALIENS THEMSELVES CAN GET CONFUSING ENOUGH BY THEMSELVES
GREAT ADVICE IN THIS THREAD I WILL GIVE A MORE GENERAL RIP PLAY THE GAME MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE JUDGING ESPECIALLY IF EVERYONE IS NEW THE GAME KINDA FELT MPH TO ME ON MY FIRST GAME BUT AFTER A FEW GAMES IT BECAME MY PERSONAL FAVORITE

AFTER A FEW GAMES YOU CAN SEE A FEW THINGS VARIOUS ALIEN INTERACTIONS 2 DIFFERENT POWERHOUSES MAYBE I GAME SOMEONE DOMINATED BUT NOT GAME 2 IF EVERYONE IS NEW YOU WILL SEE SOME STRATEGIES EMERGE SOME PLAYERS WILL GRASP THE GAME QUICKER GAMES THE FIRST BACKSTABBING WILL BE REMEMBER AND MY GROUP STILL DISCUSSES A PARTICULARLY FUNNY ONE

GO IN WITH AN OPEN MIND AND HAVE SOME FUN REMEMBER HALF THE GAME ISN'T MECHANICS IT IS THE PEOPLE INTERACTING LIE BLUFF BARTER JOKE BETRAY BETRAY THE PERSON YOU BETRAYED THE OTHER PERSON FOR THEN BETRAY AGAIN ETC


RANDOM THINGS SOMETIMES KNOWINGLY PLAYING A NEGOTIATE INTO AN ATTACK OF THE RIGHT PLAY SOME BAD IDEAS ARE SITUATIONALLY VERY GOOD DON'T PLAY LOCUST EVER ONE OF THE FEW ALIENS THAT IS JUST NOT GOOD FUN OR INTERESTING MOST ARE THOUGH REMEMBER SOME POWERS SEEM VERY STRONG AND LIKELY ARE BUT HAVE RESTRICTIONS LEVIATHAN LETS YOU ADD TO YOU ATTACKS CRAZY RIGHT BUT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT ON YOUR TURN WHILE ATTACKS SOME PEOPLE CAN ACTIVATE POWERS ON DEFENSE OR EVERY TURN KEEP THAT IN MIND I PREFER POWERS YOU CAN USE OFTEN
DEPENDS ON THE GROUP BUT I WOULDN'T ADD THE DEFENDER DECK IN THE FIRST GAME I HAVE THE HARDEST TIME EXPLAINING THE CARDS IN THERE TO PEOPLE SOMETIMES

IF YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD TRY IT WITHOUT FLARES THEN WITH FLARES THEN WITH THE DEFENDER DECK FLARES IN IF YOU JUST PLAN ON ONE GAME
OUR FIRST GAME WE USED ONLY GREEN ALIENS AND WE DIDN'T BOTHER USING ANY TECHNOLOGY CARDS IT WAS EASY TO PICK UP AND STILL A TON OF FUN
USE ONLY THE GREEN ALIENS AT FIRST THOSE MARKED FOR BEGINNERS
PEOPLE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THAT LYING IS A GAME MECHANIC AND MAY HOLD A GRUDGE AS A RESULT

I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WHO GET SCARED AWAY DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO INTRODUCE THE GAME WITH FLAIRS

NO ONE WILL UNDERSTAND THE TWO CONDITIONS TO GETTING A NEW HAND NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU EXPLAIN BECAUSE THEY WANT A NEW HAND AND YOU'RE TELLING THEM THEY CAN'T YET SO THEY WON'T LISTEN TO YOU TYPICALLY HUMANS BLOCKING OUT RULES THEY DON'T LIKE GIVE THEM A GAME OR TWO AND THEY'LL GET IT

A GOOD FRAME OF MIND IS THE MORE A PLAYER IS ENGAGED IN THE GAME THE BETTER CHANCE THEY HAVE OF WINNING EVEN IF THEY HAVE THE WORST HAND IN THE WORLD


LIE A LOT
IF YOUR ONLY ISSUE WITH MARVEL LEGENDARY IS THAT IT'S TOO EASY TO BEAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GET DARK CITY THE TWO SHOULD KIND OF BE SOLD TOGETHER THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY EXPANSION IS ALSO AWESOME BECAUSE THANOS BUT AFTER THOSE TWO YOU SHOULD JUST CHOOSE BASED ON WHAT CHARACTERS YOU LIKE
NO NEED TO EXPAND CATAN ONCE IT GOES STALE THIS JUST MEANS YOU ARE MATURING AS A BOARD GAME PLAYER MOST OF US MOVE PAST CATAN AT SOME POINT THOUGH YOU CAN CERTAINLY BE A HARDCORE GAMER WHO LOVES CATAN MORE EXPANSIONS WON'T MAKE IT MUCH BETTER

I'VE HEARD LEADERS IS EXCELLENT IF YOU LOVE WONDERS

POWER UP IS A MUST

JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY WHY DO YOU WANT TO EXPAND THOSE RATHER THAN LOOK INTO NEW ONES WHAT ELSE IS IN YOUR COLLECTION


CARCASSONNE ISN'T TRULY COMPLETE UNTIL IT HAS INNS AND CATHEDRALS AND TRADERS AND BUILDERS THOSE TWO EXPANSIONS ADD JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE GAME BETTER WITHOUT REALLY MAKING IT MUCH MORE COMPLEX I CAN'T IMAGINE PLAYING WITHOUT THEM AT THIS POINT
CITIES AND KNIGHTS MAKES CATAN PLAYABLE FOR ME THAT BEING SAID I WILL ALWAYS VOTE TO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE
SECOND CITIES AND LEADERS FOR WONDERS

CITIES IS MY FAVORITE EXPANSION FOR WONDERS SOME PARTS OF IT REQUIRES THE LEADERS EXPANSION BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT COMES WITH NEW LEADER CARDS OTHERWISE IT WORKS WITHOUT OTHER EXPANSIONS NOT A HUGE FAN OF LEADERS MYSELF SINCE I FEEL IT DOESN'T ADD MUCH TO THE GAME BESIDES HAVING A THING THAT BIASES YOUR DECISIONS A LITTLE BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY HURT WONDERS PACK IS A GOOD ONE TO GET THOUGH WHAT I DON'T RECOMMEND THOUGH IS THE BABEL EXPANSION JUST ADDS A BIT TOO MUCH TO KEEP TRACK OF AND JUST MORE STUFF MORE THAT CLUTTERS THE TABLE

FOR CARCASSONNE I'D SAY THAT YOU'RE CORRECT IN YOUR EVALUATION OF THE BASE GAME BEING NEAR PERFECTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE NEW EDITION I HAVE THE FIRST TWO EXPANSIONS AND THEY'RE JUST OKAY THEY ADD SOME POTENTIAL FOR EXPLOSIVE PLAYS BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT STILL DOESN'T HURT TO BUY THEM THOUGH AND ONE OF THEM COMES WITH A BAG TO DRAW TILES OUT OF MAKING SETUP AND CLEANUP FASTER

FOR LEGENDARY HAVE YOU TRIED PLAYING IT COMPETITIVELY I FEEL THAT CO-OP GAMES TEND TO HAVE A WEAKER LIFESPAN THAN COMPETITIVE GAMES DO BECAUSE YOU ONLY NEED TO BE BETTER THAN THE GAME FOR IT TO BE OVER WHEREAS IF YOU PLAY AGAINST OTHER PLAYERS YOU MAY FIND IT TO BE A LOT OF FUN TO CONTINUALLY TRY TO OUTPLAY EACH OTHER GIVE IT THAT EXTRA BREATH OF LIFE THAT YOU WANT OUT OF IT

POWER UP IS DEFINITELY WORTH IT WITH THE BASE GAME OF KING OF TOKYO ON ITS OWN MONSTER SELECTION FEELS PRETTY POINTLESS BECAUSE THEY ALL PLAY THE SAME EXACT WAY BUT WITH POWER UP THEY EACH GET THEIR OWN UNIQUE POWERS SO THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT THEN WHEN YOU GET BORED OF THAT THERE'S A DRAFTING VARIANT THAT LETS PLAYERS MIX AND MATCH POWERS IF KING OF TOKYO IN ITS BASE STATE IS STILL FUN FOR YOUR GROUP THOUGH I RECOMMEND HOLDING OFF ON THE EXPANSION UNTIL YOU NOTICE IT NOT HITTING THE TABLE ANYMORE
LEADERS IS FANTASTIC ALSO REALLY LIKE CITIES
I'D SUGGEST RUSSIA JAPAN FOR POWER GRID ESPECIALLY IF YOU EVER PLAY AS BOTH ARE EXCELLENT MAPS FOR THAT COUNT DUE TO THEIR MARKET OR SPACIAL NARROWNESS
I WILL SAY THAT I WILL ALMOST NEVER PLAY KING OF TOKYO WITHOUT THE POWER UP EXPANSION I LIKE THE UNIQUE POWERS THAT MAKE CHOOSING YOUR CHARACTER AN IMPORTANT CHOICE IT MAKES THE GAME SLIGHTLY LESS JUST PICK UP AND PLAY BUT IT REALLY MAKES EACH MONSTER SHINE WITHOUT RELYING ON THE MARKET CARDS
GOTTA SAY REALLY NOT TOO MUCH POINT TO KING OF TOKYO WITHOUT POWER UP
ABSOLUTELY TO PASS THE ENDEAVOUR YOU ONLY NEED TO ROLL SUCCESS AND AVOID SINKING SEE PG IN THE RULES YOU TAKE DAMAGE EQUAL TO THE DEFENSE OF THE SITE IN THIS CASE MINUS HOWEVER MANY SUCCESSES YOU ROLLED WITH DICE YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEED TO TAKE SOME DAMAGE BUT YOU MIGHT NOT SINK
SHADOWS OF BRIMSTONE IS KINDA FINICKY BUT FITS YOUR REQUIREMENTS OTHER THAN THAT I THINK DESCENT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BEST JUMPING IN POINT FOR WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ALSO WE HAVE IMPERIAL ASSAULT APP TO LOOK FORWARD TO RELEASE EARLY NEXT YEAR
SWORD AND SORCERY GLOOMHAVEN MASSIVE DARKNESS THOSE ARE THE MAIN ONES PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO NOW

MY FAVOURITE CURRENTLY IS GALAXY DEFENDERS THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IT COUNTS AS A DUNGEON CRAWLER
ARE YOU SAYING DESCENT IS TOO EXPENSIVE

IT'S REALLY NOT ANYMORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE AND THE NEW APP FOR IT IS INCREDIBLE

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
ARCADIA QUEST IS A VERY FINE PICK SINCE YOU DON'T NEED A DUNGEON MASTER
I WOULD RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING FOR TWO PLAYER GAMES THAT ARE FAST PACED
WONDERS DUEL DESIGNED FOR TWO PLAYERS ONLY
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY DON'T BE PUT OFF BY THE BOX ARTWORK IT'S A JOY TO PLAY
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY A LITTLE TRICKY TO LEARN BUT REALLY FAST AND EASY AFTER THAT
WONDERS DUEL IS AN AWESOME GAME AND PLAYS SUPER QUICK I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT
THE BIG BOOK OF MADNESS IS AWESOME
A COMBINATION OF BOARD AND CARD HERE FOR YOU SO THIS MAY BE EXTENSIVE THOUGH I'LL HOLD IT TO MY PERSONAL OWNED GAMES TO HELP

FORBIDDEN ISLAND DESERT ARE COOP GAMES THAT PLAY RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND ARE VERY ENJOYABLE

CASTLE PANIC ALSO PLAYS QUICKLY AND ENJOYABLY THOUGH IF YOU DON'T WANT STRICT COOP MUNCHKIN PANIC HAS A VERSUS SETTING

COUP IS A VERY NICE CARD GAME THAT PLAYS QUICKLY AND SCALES WELL FROM 2 PLAYERS BLUFFING HEAVILY INVOLVED COMEDY IF YOU'RE LIKE MY FRIENDS YOU'RE BLUFFING THE DUKE OH MY

MAD SCIENCE BY CRYPTOZOIC IS SUPER SUPER FUN THEME WISE LITTLE LONGER TO PLAY AND SLIGHTLY MORE RELAXED PACE BUT IT'S LIKE A MINUTE GAME PLAY REALLY FUN

GENTLEMEN THIEVES IS LESS WELL KNOWN BUT I REALLY ENJOY IT BASICALLY YOU'RE THIEVES TRYING FOR THE BIG SCORE EVERY ROUND HAS A SET OF 2 THIEVES AND A SET OF THIEVES AND YOU TAKE TURNS SETTING THE ALLIES SO THERE'S SOME STRATEGY TO THAT AS A LOCATION SCORES THE WINNING SET SPLITS LOOT EVENLY DISCARD EXTRAS WHEN THE CONSTABLE IS DRAWN THE GAME ENDS AND THE THIEF WHO HAS THE MOST LOOT WINS FAST PACED AND FUN

AEC DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE A BAD GAME AT ALL EVER AND MOST OF THEIRS ARE FUN AND FAST PACED AMONG MY FAVORITES ARE SMASH UP LOTS OF EXPANSIONS AVAILABLE SO REALLY THE GAME RARELY EVER PLAYS THE SAME WAY TWICE AND LOVE LETTER LOTS OF THEMATIC VARIANTS AND THEY JUST PUT OUT A REALLY NICE EXPANSION

IF YOU'RE INTO DICE AND DECK BUILDING THEN DICE MASTERS IS PRETTY FUN AND THE STARTER PACKS ARE PRETTY CHEAP LOTS OF FUN OPTIONS THERE THEMATICALLY D COUNTY MARVEL FALERN AND MORE

ROBOT RALLY IS NICE IN THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY AND TIME OPTIONS FAST GAME VA SLOW GAME IS JUST A DIFFERENT PAGE IN THE SETUP BOOK PREPROGRAMMED MOVES IN ESSENTIALLY A CAPTURE THE FLAG RACE AGAINST OPPONENTS IT'S GREAT FUN

KING OF TOKYO IS ANOTHER GREAT QUICK PLAY GAME COMBINATION OF SKILL AND LUCK FOR A DICE BASED GAME SEVERAL EXPANSIONS AVAILABLE

DICE GAMES TEND TO BE PRETTY QUICK BUT RARELY VARY MY FAVORITES ARE BACK TO THE FUTURE AND ZOMBIE DICE ZOMBIE DICE HAS A FEW EXPANSIONS AND VARIANTS ADDED BONUS THEY'RE REALLY COMPACT AND VERY EASY TO TEACH SO THEY MAKE GREAT TRAVEL GAMES

LOONY LABS ALSO MAKES GREAT GAMES AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SECOND TO NONE FLUX IS MY FAVORITE SIMPLE PLAYS QUICKLY AND THEY HAVE A TON OF DIFFERENT DECKS SO PICK YOUR PONY STAR MONTY PYTHON BATSMAN FIREFLY OZ ADVENTURE TIME MONSTER HOLIDAY ALL WITH THEIR OWN LITTLE QUIRKS AND DIFFERENCES ESSENTIALLY THERE ARE KEEPERS CREEPERS AND GOALS YOU WIN BY MATCHING GOAL CRITERIA THESE CHANGE AS THE GAME PLAYS EACH DECK HAS DIFFERENT THEMES ON THEM AND A DIFFERENT UNIQUE SET OF RULE CARDS AND ACTIONS TO PLAY FOR EXAMPLE IN MONTY PYTHON FLUX THERE ARE BONUSES FOR SINGING AND ACCENTS THEY ALSO MAKE A GAME CALLED LOONACY WHICH IS LIKE THE TRADITIONAL GAME OF SPEED BUT ON CRACK PILED TO HUNT INSTEAD OF 2 AND PICTURES INSTEAD OF SUITS

ANOTHER GAME THAT IS REALLY FUN IS SPLENDOR ECONOMIC STYLE GEM GRABBING AND TRADING TOWARDS VICTORY POINTS

LIBERALIA IS A FUN PIRATE THEMED GAME WHERE YOU PLAY FROM THE SAME DECK OF CHARACTERS BUT SET A DIFFERENT ORDER TO GET TREASURES AND AVOID CURSES MIGHT BE HARDER TO PLAY WITH 2 THOUGH
ONITAMA IS PRETTY GREAT WON'T LIGHT YOUR WORLD ON FIRE BUT ITS PRETTY AND A PLEASANT WAY TO PASS THE TIME WITH SOMEONE YOU LIKE
RACE FOR THE GALAXY IS OUR FAVORITE FOR TWO WE'VE ALSO RECENTLY PICKED UP JAIPUR AND ALL OF THEM ARE FAST ONCE YOU BOTH KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING IF YOU'RE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR A DECKBUILDER TAKE A LOOK AT ASCENSION
STAR WARS DESTINY IS JUST ABOUT TO RELEASE ON THE 1ST AND IT'S PRETTY FAST PACED THOUGH A COLLECTIBLE SALES MODEL 2 STARTER PACKS WOULD ONLY SET YOU BACK ABOUT THOUGH
IF YOU WANT ANOTHER TRY ASCENSION OR SOMETHING CO-OP LIKE LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN OR ATTACK ON TITAN OR SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE

I AM NOT REAL SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE PACING THING IS ABOUT AS I'VE NOT PLAYED EITHER GAME YOU MENTION BUT FOR THAT WE TEND TO PLAY WITH MINIMAL DOWNTIME WE LIKE BEYOND BAKER STREET JAIPUR PATCHWORK EMPIRE LEGENDS FLICK EM UP PANDEMIC THE CURE MANY MORE I CAN'T THINK OF AT THE MOMENT
I'M REALLY NOT SURE WHAT PACING YOU MEAN KINGDOM BUILDER HAS MUCH FASTER TURNS THAN DOMINION YOU CAN USUALLY FULLY DECIDE YOUR TURN WHILE THE OTHER PERSON GOES
THE DUKE
WE'VE FOUND FIVE TRIBES 2 PLAYER OR QUADROPOLIS IS LESS THAN AN HOUR
THE ENTIRE STONEMAIER GAMES LINE IS FAST PACED

EUPHORIA SCYTHE VITICULTURE TUSCANY SHORT TURNS SHORTER GAMES
LOST CITIES IS PRETTY FAST PACED ONCE YOU LEARN IT PLAYS IN MINUTES OR SO I THINK IT'S GOT A NICE BALANCE OF LUCK AND STRATEGY TOO BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A LIGHTER GAME
JAIPUR AND GUILDHALL COULD BE GOOD CHOICES
THE UPCOMING RELEASE FROM RENEGADE GAMES BLOOD OF AN ENGLISHMAN IS A FAST PACED ASYNCHRONOUS CARD GAME BASICALLY ONE PLAYER PLAYS AS JACK OF JACK AND THE BEANSTALK AND THE OTHER PLAYER ACTS AS THE GIANT

JACK IS ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT SETS OF BEANSTALK CARDS IN ASCENDING ORDER AND FINISH THEM OFF WITH A TREASURE THE GIANT IS ATTEMPTING TO GET THE FEE FI FO FUM CARDS EITHER ALL AT THE BOTTOM OF STACKS OR ALL TOGETHER IN ONE STACK PLAYS IN ABOUT MINUTES OR SO REALLY FUN GAME
A FEW MORE FAST GAMES

HIVE MINUTES

STAR REALMS MINUTES

KAHUNA MINUTES

MEDIEVAL ACADEMY MINUTES
I'D RECOMMEND MYSTIC VALE CHECK IT OUT


IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ASKING FOR A GAME FULL OF DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT PLAYERS DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
ANALYSIS PARALYSIS TENDS TO BE MORE OF A PLAYER ISSUE THAN A GAME ISSUE BUT THAT SAID

I'D SAY ANY OF MAC GERDTS GAMES FIT ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT USE A RONDEL ANTIAE IMPERIAL NAVEGADOR ETC ON YOUR TURN YOU TAKE A SINGLE ACTION FROM A SUBSET OF POSSIBLE ACTIONS AND THEY TEND TO BE FAIRLY SIMPLE TO EXECUTE THE TRICK IS CREATING CHAINS OF ACTIONS TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS AND INTERSPERSING OTHER ACTIONS TO GET OVERLAPPING CHAINS THAT HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THE OTHER PLAYERS

TURNS WHIP BY BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CONCISE BUT THE TIME BETWEEN TURNS IS ENOUGH GENERALLY FOR YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO IN A LOT OF GAMES YOU GET ENOUGH ROOM ON YOUR TURN TO GET A LOT DONE IN GERDTS GAMES YOU HAVE TO BREAK YOUR PLANS UP ACROSS MANY TURNS SO EVERYONE TENDS TO MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY
TO BE FAIR TO OP SOME ARE DEFINITELY WORSE THAN OTHERS I THINK MORE STRATEGIC MULTIPLAYER SOLITAIRE GAMES ARE YOUR BEST OPTIONS YOU PICK A GENERAL START AND THAT MAKES PICKING AMONGST THE LARGE NUMBER EASIER IT'S LIKELY THAT ONLY A FEW OF THOSE AVAILABLE WILL BE THE OBJECTIVE BEST THAT AND OTHER PLAYERS WON'T THROW TOO MANY WRENCHES INTO THE MIX

I THINK THAT'S WHY A GAME LIKE AGRICOLA TENDS TO BE EASIER THAN SOMETHING LIKE TRIBES EVEN THOUGH THE FORMER IS HEAVIER THAN THE LATTER
I WOULD SAY TECHNICALLY ANY EURO COULD FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY AS AP IS DEFINITELY PLAYER BASED AND EVEN GAMES THAT YOU'D NOT THINK INDUCE AP CAN IN FACT INDUCE AP

THAT BEING SAID IN MY EXPERIENCE VINOS DELUXE EDITION IS ONE OF THE FASTEST PLAYING HEAVY GAMES I OWN TEACHING THIS GAME IS A BEAST WITH ALL THE LITTLE ACTIONS BUT IT PLAYS BUTTERY SMOOTH WHILE IT MIGHT NOT BE I BREEZE THROUGH A TWO PLAYER GAME IN AN HOUR AND THE LONGEST A FOUR PLAYER HAS TAKEN ME IS

I'VE YET TO HAVE A CHANCE TO PLAY IT BUT I'D IMAGINE THE ALLERGIST WOULD BE A SIMILAR CASE
NUMBER I'VE SEEN SOMEONE AP IN CARCASSONNE FFS
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO REGULARLY GET AP FROM LOVE LETTER YOU ARE BLAMING THE WRONG THING
I WOULD LOOK FOR A GAME THAT MITIGATES THE AP INSTEAD OF ALLEVIATING IT GAMES WITH SIMULTANEOUS SELECTION CAN FUNNEL THE MOST INVOLVED DECISIONS INTO THESE SIMULTANEOUS MOMENTS SO EVERYONE CAN REFINE THEIR PLAN WHILE WAITING FOR THE MOST AP PLAYER

FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A GAME LIKE THIS
PRETTY MUCH ANY GAME CAN BE OVER ANALYZED BY PEOPLE DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES NO GAME IS GOING TO MAGICALLY HAVE ALL PLAYERS INSTANTLY KNOWING THEIR BEST MOVE UNLESS IT PLAYS ITSELF WHICH WOULD BE A REALLY SHITTY GAME ON THE FLIPSIDE OF THAT NO EURO GAMES REALLY TRIP ME UP BUT COMBAT CONFLICT HEAVY GAMES BOG THE HELL DOWN FOR ME AP COMES DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL PLAYER THEIR MOOD THEIR TASTE AND A TON OF OTHER FACTORS
TERRAFORMING MARS IS PRETTY GOOD FOR THIS SINCE A LOT THE MOMENTS WHEN THERE COULD BE AP ARE DONE SIMULTANEOUSLY SUCH AS WHEN YOU'RE GETTING NEW CARDS AND ACTUAL TURNS MOVE PRETTY QUICKLY IT'S A BIT MORE OF A MEDIUM WEIGHT GAME THOUGH

I FIND FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE TO BE SIMILAR THE MOST AP PART OF CHOOSING WHICH EMPLOYEES TO PLAY IS DONE SIMULTANEOUSLY ACTUALLY DOING YOUR TURN AND USING YOUR EMPLOYEES SHOULDN'T TAKE AS LONG SINCE YOU ALREADY DECIDED HOW TO USE THEM THOUGH OTHERS PLAYERS ACTIONS MAY HAVE AFFECTED HOW YOU WERE GOING TO PLAY THEM
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH INTERACTIVITY THERE IS BETWEEN PLAYERS IF ANOTHER PLAYER'S TURN DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON YOUR TURN YOU SHOULD BE PLANNING OUT YOUR TURN IN ADVANCE
SCYTHE SEEMS TO HANDLE THIS PRETTY WELL SINCE THE MOMENT A PLAYER PICKS AN ACTION THEN THE NEXT PLAYER CAN ESSENTIALLY GO UNLESS IF THEY PICKED MOVEMENT NOW IT WON'T FIX AP BECAUSE PLAYERS WILL STILL NEED TO DECIDE ON WHAT TO DO BUT IT WILL CUT DOWN ON YOUR DOWNTIME
MOMBASA HAS VERY QUICK TURNS BECAUSE EVERYONE BASICALLY ALREADY PICKED WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN THE PLANNING PHASE
DEFINITELY THE PLAYER'S FAULT BUT IT CAN BE HELPED BY PLAYING GAMES THAT ALLOW PLAYERS TO THINK ABOUT THEIR TURNS DURING OTHER PEOPLES TURNS OR IMPLEMENTING A HOUSE RULE THAT ALLOWS THIS BUT DOESN'T AFFECT THE GAME ITSELF IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY LIKE THE HOUSE RULE IN CARCASSONNE WHERE YOU DRAW YOUR TILE AT THE END OF YOUR TURN INSTEAD OF AT THE START OF IT
I'D SAY THE AVAILABLE ACTIONS FOR TERRA MYSTIC ARE FAIRLY SIMPLE YOU MIGHT END UP WITH A SLOW FIRST TURN IN A ROUND AS EVERYONE FIGURES OUT THEIR PLAN FOR THE ROUND
TIMING CUBES HELP MORE THAN GAME SELECTION IT'S TRULY TIME BLINDNESS NOT BEING SLOW JERKS WHO KNOW IT FOR MOST PEOPLE

THAT SAID ROADS AND BOATS IS PRETTY DECENT AT BEING PRETTY QUICK FOR THE DEPTH I THINK PEOPLE GIVE UP ON A TOTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THAT ONE PRETTY QUICKLY AND KNOW THEY'RE MAKING DO


SO WHAT BREAKS AP IS RANDOMNESS SO HEAVY WAR GAMES TEND TO HAVE LESS AP THAN HEAVY EUROS IT PUT A HORIZON ON THE TIMELINES THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING OVER IN THEIR HEADS

I PERSONALLY FIND SUPER LONG TRAIN GAMES EVENTUALLY WEAR DOWN AND BECOME A US AGAINST TIME FIGHT IS A CANDIDATE THERE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SHORTER IF YOU'RE JUST PLAIN LOOKING FOR FRENZIED PLAY IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN BECAUSE YO WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY LITERALLY


GALAXY TRUCKER

ODDLY ENOUGH OUR AP PLAYER LOVES IT
IT'S NOT THE GAME THAT INDUCES AP IT'S THE PLAYER THAT FALLS INTO AP
PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO STOP USING SHORT FORMS WITHOUT EXPLAINING THEM FIRST I WAS LIKE WAIT WHAT ACTION POINTS AND NO IT WAS NOT OBVIOUS AND NO IT'S NOT A COMMONLY USED ABBREVIATION

AND AS SOMEONE ALREADY MENTIONED IT'S A PLAYER THING NOT THE GAMES FAULT ATLEAST MOST OF THE TIME AND THE HEAVIER THE GAME THE WORSE THE ISSUE IT'S CONTRADICTIVE A GAME BEEFING IS NOT REALLY A THING FOR HEAVIER GAMES IT'S LIKE SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT AND HOPING IT WON'T HURT

I GUESS A EURO WHERE PLAYERS TAKE THEIR TURNS SIMULTANEOUSLY WOULD BE A GOOD START
I'M NOT SURE I'D CALL IT HEAVY BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN AN AP ISSUE WITH PUERTO RICO
JUST PICKED UP CODE NAMES AND IT CAME WITH A SAND TIMER THAT LOOKS TO BE THERE'S YOUR SOLUTION FOR ANALYSIS PARALYSIS
NOT TERRA MYSTIC OR SCYTHE
I AM THE LUCKY AND PROUD OWNER OF THIS TABLE AND WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND AND HIS DAD'S WORK THE TABLE LOOKS EVEN BETTER IN REAL LIFE AND IT IS EXPERTLY BUILT YOU CAN TELL THEY REALLY TOOK THE CARE AND EXTRA TIME IT TAKES TO MAKE A BEAUTIFUL PRODUCT HIS DAD SAID WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AND NOT CUT ANY CORNERS AND YOU CAN REALLY TELL WITH THE FINISHED PRODUCT

THANK YOU AND S DAD
FANTASTIC WORK WELL DONE
LOVE IT I'VE WANTED TO BUILD MY OWN FOR SO LONG HOW MUCH WERE THE MATERIALS FOR THIS AND HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU GUYS TO BUILD IT

ALSO HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO BUY ONE OF THESE FROM YOU YOU'RE PROBABLY MUCH BETTER AT WOOD WORKING THAN I AM
I WANT ONE SO MUCH EVERY TIME I SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS UM THOUGH NOT AT THE MOMENT WHILE I CONSIDER MOVING I'D LOVE A HUGE DINING ROOM ONE AND THEN I'D ADD SOME CUSTOM PAINTED BITS
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL
VERY COOL DO YOU GUYS MAKE A PRETTY STANDARD DESIGN OR DO YOU MAKE THEM WITH DIFFERENT OPTIONS OR CUSTOM FOR EACH PERSON

I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN GETTING ONE BUT NONE OF THE ONES I'VE SEEN FOR SALE HAVE EVERYTHING I WANT IF YOU ARE NEAR ME FOR PICKUP AND WOULD BE WILLING TO CUSTOMIZE A BIT FOR A REASONABLE PRICE I'M INTERESTED
SO WANT TO MAKE ONE AND SHIP IT TO ME
REALLY GREAT JOB
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SHOW A PICTURE OF HOW YOU DID THE DRAWERS MAYBE JUST A SHOT OF WHAT THE TABLE LOOKS LIKE FROM UNDERNEATH I AM EARLY ON IN BUILDING MY OWN GAMES TABLE AND HAVING TROUBLE PLANNING OUT THE DRAWERS
NICE JOB CAN I ASK HOW DID YOU COME TO ARRIVE AT YOUR FINAL DIMENSIONS WHAT HEIGHT DID YOU FINALLY DECIDE TO MAKE THE TABLE AND HOW DID THAT AFFECT YOUR LEG ROOM
VERY NICE LOOKING
GREAT JOB
THE FIRST ONE IS VASARI
I GOT THE NAME OF THE GERMAN ONE IT'S DIE MANGIER VON PANGA
THANKS FOR THE HELP EVERYONE
DELETED
QUANTUM

GIVE GALAXY TRUCKER A LOOK IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING YOU NEVER PLAYED BEFORE BUT IT PRETTY MUCH COVERS ALL THE POINTS PLUS IT'S A WONDERFUL GAME
STAR WARS REBELLION MAYBE WORTH A TRY
I'D SAY FORBIDDEN STARS BETTER GET IT BEFORE GOES OUT OF PRINT STAR TREK FLEET CAPTAINS IS GOOD AS WELL PLAYS WELL WITH AND HAS A STRONG EXPLORATION ASPECT TO IT BUT IT'S A BIT MORE STAR WARS REBELLION IS VERY COMPETITIVE SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT
AIA IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THOUGH I'M NOT SURE HOW GREAT IT IS WITH 2

BUT IF A BIT OF LOGISTICAL PUZZLE SOLVING AND SPACE TRAVEL BASED ON THE REALITY OF OUR SPACE RACE IS OF INTEREST I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHECKING OUT LEAVING EARTH

OF THE TWO I THINK LEAVING EARTH IS BETTER BUT AIA HAS MORE MAINSTREAM APPEAL

EDIT IF A SPACE BATTLE GAME FOR 2 IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SPACE EMPIRES COULD BE WHAT YOU ARE AFTER

IT PLAYS PLAYERS BEST AT 2 BUT FFA OR TEAMS IS POSSIBLE AND WITH PLAYERS USE ALTERNATE VICTORY CONDITIONS

IT HAS FOG OF WAR TECH TREES EXPLORATION AND PLENTY OF BATTLES

IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MUCH AND SMALL CARDBOARD CHITS IS A THROWBACK TO OLD SCHOOL WARGAMING BUT RULES WISE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT AND I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD DO FOG OF WAR ANY OTHER WAY
OBVIOUS ANSWER IS TWILIGHT EMPORIUM JUST KIDDING OR AM I

I ENJOY STAR TREK PANIC BUT THERE'S NO EXPLORATION THERE

TRY UP SOME AIA LEGENDS OF A DRIFT SYSTEM ONLY I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD DO WITH 2
HOW ABOUT THE EXPANSIONS FOR ECLIPSE MAKES IT MUCH BETTER AS A TWO PLAYER GAME
DOES HE LIKE THE STAR TREK IP IF SO STAR TREK ASCENDANCY FITS THIS NICHE AND WHILE IT TECHNICALLY IS A PLAYER GAME PLAYS FINE AT 2
I'M HOLDING MY BREATH FOR A HANDFUL OF STARS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE AVAILABLE FOR SOON
EMPIRES OF THE VOID
IF YOU ARE NOT REPELLED BY THE ANIME THEME TRAGEDY LOOPER
IS THE GAME LOOKING FOR THERE IS A EVIL MASTERMIND GM AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT PLOTS WITH DIFFERENT STORIES AND IF YOU FINISH THEM THE GM CAN MAKE HIS OWN STORIES OR YOU CAN GET EXPANSIONS THE PLAYERS ARE TIME TRAVELERS THAT ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THE MURDER THAT WILL HAPPEN IN A KNOWN TIME BUT THE KILLER AND WHERE THE MURDER WILL HAPPEN IS UNKNOWN AND IF THEY FAIL TO STOP IT THEY CAN TRY AGAIN BUT THEY HAVE LIMITED RETRIES HOPE THIS HELPS
MYSTERIUM AND DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG WOULD BE RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY

IN MYSTERIUM ONE PLAYER CONTROLS A GHOST GM WHO HAS TO GIVE CLUES TO THE OTHER DETECTIVES TO HELP FIGURE OUT WHO KILLED HIM WHERE HE GOT KILLED AND WHAT WEAPON WAS USED HOWEVER THE GHOSTS CAN ONLY INTERACT WITH THE DETECTIVES BY USING VAGUE PICTURES TO HELP HINT ON THE ANSWER THE GAME IS PURELY CO-OPERATIVE AND EVERYONE WINS WHEN THE DETECTIVES FIGURE OUT ALL THE ANSWERS THE ART IS STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND THE MOOD IS EASY TO SETTLE IN THE GROUP THAT SAID THE GAME IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON WHO YOU PLAY WITH AND IS NOT FOR EVERYONE

DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG IS ANOTHER DEDUCTIVE REASONING GAME BUT HAS A BETRAYER MECHANIC ONE PERSON PLAYS THE FORENSIC SCIENTIST GM ONE PERSON PLAYS THE MURDERER AND THE REST WILL BE PLAYING AS INVESTIGATORS DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS AN ACCOMPLICE AND A WITNESS WILL BE ADDED AMONG THE PLAYERS THE FORENSIC SCIENTIST HAS THE SOLUTION BUT CAN EXPRESS THE CLUES ONLY USING SPECIAL SCENE TILES WHILE THE INVESTIGATORS AND THE MURDERER ATTEMPT TO INTERPRET THE EVIDENCE SO NOT ONLY DO THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE TRUTH THE MURDERER MAKES THAT HARDER BY ADDING IN SOME LIES AND MAKES DISCORD IN THE DISCUSSION

OVERALL DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG WOULD BE THE BETTER CHOICE AS A WIDER VARIETY OF PEOPLE CAN PLAY AND ENJOY IT COMPARED TO MYSTERIUM NOT TO SAY THAT MYSTERIUM IS A BAD GAME ITS FUN WHEN IT CLICKS BUT THE EXPERIENCE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE IMAGINATIONS OF THE GHOST PLAYER AND WHAT THE DETECTIVES CAN INFER FROM IT
REQUIRES NO DM AND IT'S LESS OF A BOARD GAME AND MORE OF AN RPG BUT FIASCO CAN DEFINITELY ACCOMPLISH THIS ALSO IF YOU'D LIKE TO WRITE THE CAMPAIGN DREAD ALSO CAN DO THIS AS WELL I LITERALLY JUST PLAYED A FIVE NIGHTS AT MYSTERY SCENARIO A FRIEND CREATED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
MANSIONS OF MADNESS IS MAYBE SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE THERE'S A 2ND EDITION OUT WHERE THE GM ROLE IS HANDLED BY A TABLET APP BUT THE 1ST EDITION IS KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING

IT'S PLAYERS WITH ONE PLAYER AS A KEEPER WHO SETS UP THE SCENARIO INCLUDING CLUES TO THE MYSTERY FOUND IN SPECIFIC ROOMS HIDDEN BEHIND PUZZLES THE OTHER PLAYERS ARE INVESTIGATORS COMING TO FIGURE OUT THE MYSTERY

CAVEATS INCLUDE IT BEING LOVECRAFTIAN WITH THE INCLUDED MONSTERS AND INSANITY THIS USUALLY ENTAILS A PRETTY INVOLVED SETUP HENCE THE 2ND EDITION WHERE IT'S ALL HANDLED BY AN APP AND A BIT OF RULE LANKINESS IN CERTAIN SCENARIOS SOMETHING YOU MAY READ ABOUT THE GAME IS LIMITED PLAYABILITY DUE TO ONLY SCENARIOS BUT EACH OF THOSE SCENARIOS HAVE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SETUPS SO THE GAME IS GOOD FOR HUNDREDS OF PLAYS WAY MORE THAN YOU'D EVER NEED
DEFINITELY CHECK OUT DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG AND TRAGEDY LOOPER ONE IS QUICK AND THE OTHER IS LONGER AND POSSIBLY MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT YOU ARE AFTER I PREFER THE FORMER SINCE IT SUPPORTS MORE PEOPLE AND IT'S JUST EASIER BUT LOVE THEM BOTH
TRAGEDY LOOPER
THE GENERAL TERM FOR THIS KIND OF GAME IS A PARLOR AARP
YES FIASCO

YOU MIGHT ENJOY THE LEVERAGE RPG BOOK IT'S BASED OFF THE TV SERIES AND HAS TONS OF LITTLE MINI ADVENTURES FOR RP

LET ME THINK ON IT AND SEE IF I'M FINDING MORE THAT AREN'T ALREADY BEING MENTIONED

THERE'S AN OLD SERIES OF GAMES SET FOR JUST THIS THEY'RE IN A BOX MURDER MYSTERY PARTY NIGHTS WHERE YOU HOST A DINNER PARTY OR SOMETHING EVERYONE GETS AN INVITE AND A CHARACTER AND WORKS TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY THOUGH DATED THEY ARE STILL AWESOME THEY WERE RELEASED BY BEMUZZLED AND MANY ARE ON EBAY FOR OR SO

ESCAPE THE ROOM HAS A SERIES OF GAMES AS WELL ONE IS SOLD AT TARGET THEY'RE MADE BY THINKFUL

I WILL ECHO FIASCO THAT GAME IS RIDICULOUSLY FUN AND VERY VERY FLEXIBLE

SELLS SEVERAL OF THESE STYLE GAMES BUT THEY'RE NON VERY CHEAP AND I'VE NEVER PLAYED THEM SO CAN'T GUARANTEE THEIR WORTH
SPYFAULT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR THIS ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING YOU CAN JUST USE YOUR PHONES IT'S A SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAME WHERE PLAYER IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ALL OF THE OTHER PLAYERS ARE AT

ALSO ALONG THE SAME LINES AS CH I WOULD SUGGEST UNEMPLOYED AND STIPULATIONS
CODENAMES IS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME AND GREAT WHEN YOU MAINLY WANT TO SOCIALIZE
LOVE LETTER OR LOVE LETTER PREMIUM EDITION THE GAME IS REALLY SIMPLE AND I'VE HAD ENDLESS FUN FOR AN EXTREMELY CHEAP AND PORTABLE GAME THE STANDARD GAME IS ONLY PLAYER BUT THE PREMIUM EDITION IS ABOUT X MORE EXPENSIVE BUT COMES WITH AN EXPANSION TO MAKE IT GO UP TO PLAYERS
I ALWAYS ENJOY PLAYING LORDS OF WATERDEEP DURING ROADTRIPS
ANOMIA YOU CAN FIT A COUPLE OF DECKS IN A DECK BOX BANG OR BANG THE DICE GAME SUSHI GO CAR WARS THE CARD GAME I BELIEVE CODENAMES WILL FIT IN A DECK BOX OR 2 AS WELL
FLUX EXPLODING KITTENS SKULL

RED IF YOU THINK THEY WOULD LIKE SOMETHING WITH A BIT MORE THINKING
THERE'S QUITE A FEW FROM HEROES MONSTER COLLECTIONS

SEER KEL FROM STEWARDS OF THE SECRET

CHALLARA AND LYSSA FROM BONDS OF THE WILD

ZYLA FROM TREATY OF CHAMPIONS

ASTARRA FROM CRUSADE OF THE FORGOTTEN

DEBRA FROM LABYRINTH OF RUIN
CHECK THE WIKI HERE MAYBE ASTARRA FROM THE CRUSADE OF THE FORGOTTEN PACK
LOOK INTO SPYFAULT DIXIT CASH N GUNS LIFEBOATS AND BANG
YOU SHOULD DEFINEDLY TRY CODENAMES ITS A REALLY FUN WORD RELATION GAME I CAN ASSURE YOU ONE OF THE BEST CASUAL GAMES OUT THERE OTHER THAN THAT TRY WEREWOLF EASY TO PRINT AND PLAY AND VERY SIMILAR TO AVALON IF YOU LIKED THAT
WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CODENAMES GOOD PARTY GAME AND GAME BE PLAYED IN MINUTES AND SETUP IS SUPER SIMPLE FOR A CO-OP GAME PANDEMIC IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE TAKES ABOUT AN MINUTES TO PLAY AND SETUP IS PRETTY SIMPLE
GRIFTERS SET IN THE SAME UNIVERSE AS COUP AND THE RESISTANCE AND IT IS AROUND THE PRICE POINT

BEYOND BAKER STREET IT'S LIKE HANAFI BUT HAS THEME AND IS SAID TO WORK BETTER AT 2 PLAYERS AND SUPPORTS UP TO PLAYERS I LOVE IT

BANG THE DICE GAME PRETTY FUN IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE

EMPIRE LEGENDS IT'S A FAST AND SIMPLE AREA CONTROL GAME I LOVE IT

DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG THIS IS MY GAME OF CHOICE WHENEVER POSSIBLE I WOULD PLAY IT EVEN OVER THE RESISTANCE WHICH PREVIOUSLY WAS MY FAVORITE GAME I DON'T KNOW THE PRICE IN THE US BUT IT'S CANADIAN WORTH EVERY CENT TO ME

DIAMANT A CAVE EXPLORATION GAME VERY SIMPLE TO TEACH AND PLAY THE NEWEST VERSION FROM AELLO IS GREAT

OTHERS TO CHECK OUT

SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM

SAY ANYTHING

UP TITLE RECALL

BIBLIOG

WITS WAGERS

DIMMET

THE GAME

NO THANKS

FOR SALE
SUSHI GO PARTY
BONANZA
DIMMET
ALL THREE GAMES ARE RATHER LIGHT AND SMALL BUT OFFER A LOT OF REPLAYABLITY AND ARE VERY CHEAP

THE RESISTANCE KING OF TOKYO SLIGHTLY MORE THAN PANDEMIC
FOR SALE COULD BE RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY IT'S A CARD GAME WITH AUCTIONING MECHANICS WHERE PLAYERS TRY ESSENTIALLY FLIP HOUSES FOR A PROFIT TO IT'S VERY EASY TO LEARN AND CAN TAKE ONLY ABOUT MINUTES IF EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING BEST WITH PLAYERS BUT IS WELL BALANCED AND CAN EASILY PLAY WITH PLAYERS
RUMBLE IN THE DUNGEON IS FUN IT'S PRETTY CHEAP AND HAS ABOUT A MINUTE PLAY TIME BUT YOU NORMALLY PLAY ROUNDS

TRURO IS A FUN GAME FOR PLAYERS IT HAS MINUTE ROUNDS BUT YOU NORMALLY PLAY A BUNCH OF ROUNDS

CELESTIA IS A VERY DIFFERENT AND FUN GAME FOR PLAYERS IT TAKES ABOUT MINUTES TO PLAY IT'S A PUSH YOUR LUCK GAME

DIPLOMACY IS A VERY LONG BOARD GAME FOR PLAYERS IT IS ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES DURING A WAR IT TAKES OR MORE HOURS TO PLAY



AVALON SET IT OFF FOR ME TOO DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG IS WHAT I SUGGEST YOU GET NEXT
I AM GOING TO IGNORE ALL YOUR REQUIREMENTS AND SUGGEST COSMIC ENCOUNTER AVALON AND COSMIC ARE MY GROUPS 2 FAVORITE GAMES I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD SUGGEST COSMIC WITH BUT WITH IT'S GOLDEN COSMIC HAS REPLACEABILITY THROUGH THE ROOF
IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUY BOARD GAMES AS YOU'VE STATED I WOULD PROBABLY NOT MAKE THEM ALL CO-OP TEAM PARTY GAMES THERE'S A LARGE VARIETY OF GAMES OUT THERE TO EXPLORE SOMEONE ELSE MENTIONED COSMIC ENCOUNTER WHICH IS ANOTHER GREAT SOCIAL GAME FOR LARGER GROUPS SAN JUAN IS A GOOD INTRO INTO THE EURO STYLE ENGINE BUILDER TYPE OF GAMES YOU WORK TO BUILD THE BEST PLANTATION BY BUILDING BUILDINGS WITH SPECIAL POWERS OR THAT SUPPORT YOUR CROPS TO GET MORE POINTS ISTANBUL IS A GREAT GAME WHERE YOU DEPLOY WORKERS TO VISIT DIFFERENT BUILDINGS AND GAIN ABILITIES TO GET YOU GEMS AND POINTS PANDEMIC IS A REALLY POPULAR CO-OP GAME WITH A CENTRAL MAP WHERE EVERYONE IS TRYING TO CONTAIN CURE DISEASE OUTBREAKS ALL OVER THE WORLD IT'S SUPER FUN BUT WORKS BETTER WITH 2 OR PEOPLE BETWEEN TWO CITIES IS A SEMI CO-OP WHICH WORKS FOR LARGER GROUPS YOU WORK WITH THE PERSON TO YOUR LEFT AND RIGHT TO BUILD 2 SEPARATE CITIES WITH YOUR THEIR TILES THERE ARE ALWAYS 2 WINNERS IN THE GAME AND YOU WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM
STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU GET CARCASSONNE AT SOME POINT PLAYS PLAYERS CAN PLAY WITH AN EXPANSION SIMPLE TO LEARN BUT WITH PLENTY OF DEPTH IT WAS THE FIRST GAME I GOT AND GAMES LATER IT IS STILL MY FAVOURITE
ANOMIA SUSHI GO ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF CAR WARS CARD GAME DIXIT OR MYSTERIUM CODENAMES BANG THE DICE GAME THEN THERE ARE STANDARDS LIKE DOMINION CARCASSONNE WONDERS CATAN TICKET TO RIDE SOME MAY REQUIRE EXPANSIONS TO PLAY WITH
ABSOLUTELY GET PANDEMIC IT PLAYS BUT YOU ARE ALL TOGETHER SO HAVING AROUND THE TABLE IS NO PROBLEM AT ALL IT'S MY FAVORITE GAME ESPECIALLY FOR NEWCOMERS AND EVEN NOW WITH HUNDREDS IN MY COLLECTION PLUS IT'S LIKE ON AMAZON TARGET WILL PRICE MATCH
A LIMIT DOESN'T GIVE YOU MUCH CHOICE ESPECIALLY AT THAT PLAYER COUNT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER UPPING THE PRICE A BIT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING A BIT MORE COMPLEX

SECRET HITLER WOULD WORK ALTHOUGH IT IS PRETTY SIMILAR TO AVALON MAYBE A BIT TOO SIMILAR THE PREMISE IS PLAYER IS SECRETLY HITLER OR MORE PLAYERS ARE FASCISTS LOOKING TO GET HITLER MADE CHANCELLOR THE HITLER PLAYER DOESN'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE THOUGH AND THE REST ARE LIBERALS LOOKING TO PREVENT THIS AND PASS THEIR OWN POLICIES

DEAD LAST IS ALSO SIMILAR IT'S KIND OF LIKE SURVIVOR WHERE OVER MULTIPLE ROUNDS PLAYERS VOTE EACH OTHER OFF BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO VOTE FOR THE SAME PERSON AS THE MAJORITY DO IF YOU VOTE FOR SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE ONE WHO GETS ELIMINATED YOU'RE ALSO ELIMINATED SO YOU'RE TRYING TO SEND TELLS TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHO TO VOTE FOR AND WHATNOT YOU CAN'T BE TOO OBVIOUS THOUGH BECAUSE IF SOMEONE REALIZES THEY'RE GOING TO GET VOTED OFF THEY CAN PLAY A CARD WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO FORCE SOMEONE ELSE OFF INSTEAD

FOR SALE IS MUCH DIFFERENT IT'S A REAL ESTATE GAME WITH 2 PHASES IN THE FIRST PHASE YOU'RE BUYING VARIOUS PROPERTIES AND IN THE 2ND PHASE YOU'RE SELLING THEM OFFICIAL
3D PRINTED CATAN BOARD PIECES SEEN THAT A LOT IN THINGIVERSE AND GENERALLY ANY CUSTOM 3D PRINTED STUFF FOR BOARDGAMES IF PAINTING MINIATURES IS CONSIDERED CUSTOM DESIGN THAN THAT TOO
I MADE THE CUSTOM JAIPUR SET USING POKER CHIPS THAT WAS ON HERE IN THE PAST IT'S BOSS TO PLAY WITH THE HEAVIER CHIPS
SOME PEOPLE HAVE POSTED REALLY BINGED OUT VERSIONS OF PAINTED WHEELS GEAR AND THE LIKE REALLY INTRICATE WORK AND THE RESULTS ARE BEAUTIFUL
FLAG DASH DON'T OWN IT MYSELF BUT I HAVE SEEN SOME POSITIVE REVIEWS
IS LIKE CAPTURE THE FLAG WITH MAGICAL COMBAT
YOU CAN PLAY CTF WITH ROBORALLY BUT YOU COULD BE IN FOR A LONG GAME
STRATEGE
THE DUKE HAS FLAGS IN IT FOR A CAPTURE THE FLAG STYLE GAME
CONFUSION IS A COLD WAR THEMED GAME IN WHICH YOU TRY TO GET A BRIEFCASE AND BRING IT ACROSS THE ENEMY BORDER IT SOUNDS A BIT LIKE CAPTURE THE FLAG BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAP ETC
CHAOSMOS MAY BE WORTH CHECKING OUT

THE WINNER OF THE GAME IS THE PLAYER WHO IS HOLDING THE OVOID CARD WHEN THE GAME ENDS BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS WHEN THE GAME STARTS IT'S GOT AN INTERESTING MIX OF DEDUCTION BLUFFING AND COMBAT
HEY OP SOMETIMES WE GET HYPER FOCUSED ON HOT MODERN BOARD GAMES AND WE FORGET THE MOST OBVIOUS ANSWER STRATEGE IS CAPTURE THE FLAG THE BOARD GAME LITERALLY IT'S NEVER TALKED ABOUT ON HERE AND HAS A LOW RATING SO WATCH A VIDEO BEFORE YOU BUY BUT IT'S THE MOST CORRECT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IT'S ALSO A CLASSIC BUT IT CAN GET OLD FAST
FORBIDDEN STARS
MEMOIR
THE EXPANSION FOR DOOM HAS A CTF MODE
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS CHAOSMOS WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED

THERE'S ALSO LIMBY MOJO A GAME OF SHAMANISTIC TRIBES TRYING TO USURP THE THRONE AND BECOME THE NEW KING THE FIRST PHASE IS A COOPERATIVE GAME OF BREAKING INTO HIS FORTRESS AND THE SECOND HALF IS A COMPETITIVE FREE-FOR-ALL GAME OF TRYING TO CARRY THE CROWN BACK TO YOUR BASE MUCH LIKE CAPTURE THE FLAG HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT IT SOUNDED INTERESTING AND SO IT'S ON MY WISH LIST
WE'VE PLAYED A GREAT CAPTURE THE FLAG VARIANT OF ROBORALLY EVEN THE STANDARD ROBORALLY RULES HAVE A CTF RACE FEEL
I REALLY ENJOY THE WOW MINIS GAME FOR AN AREA CONTROL BOARD GAME THAT HAS A CAPTURE THE FLAG FEEL

BOARDGAME

KEYFLOWER HAS MEEDLESS OF DIFFERENT COLORS AND THEY CAN'T BE MIXED USUALLY SO WHEN SOMEONE USES OR BIDS ON A PARTICULAR TILE USING SAY YELLOW MEEDLESS ALL BIDS FROM OTHER PLAYERS MUST ALSO USE YELLOW

COLONIA HAS MULTIPLE CURRENCIES AND CIRC CERTAIN ITEMS CAN ONLY BE BOUGHT WITH ONE OR ANOTHER THERE ARE CONVERSION RATES TOO I THINK IT'S BEEN A WHILE AND I NEVER SUGGESTED WE PLAY THE GAME A SECOND TIME

ALHAMBRA HAS MULTIPLE CURRENCIES TOO BUT LIKE KEYFLOWER DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A CONVERSION RATE UNLESS ONE WAS INTRODUCED IN ONE OF ITS MANY EXPANSIONS
YOU MIGHT CHECK OUT THE VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO THERE'S ONLY TYPE OF MONEY BUT YOU ARE CONSTANTLY CONVERTING RESOURCES FROM ONE TYPE TO ANOTHER TO HAVE JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT FOR YOUR GOALS BETWEEN CABALS GOODS AND COINS YOU WILL BE MANAGING ALL THREE AS CURRENCY THROUGHOUT THE GAME
IT MIGHT NOT QUITE HIT THE MARK BUT DO TAKE A LOOK AT STOCKPILE YOU TRADE IN VARIOUS COMPANY STOCKS THAT ALWAYS GO UP OR DOWN EACH TURN TRADE IS PERHAPS A BIT TOO GENEROUS A WORD YOU BID FOR PILES OF STOCKS AND YOU CHOOSE WHEN TO SELL THE STOCKS YOU CANNOT ACTUALLY TRADE STOCKS WITH THE OTHER PLAYERS THE EXPANSION ALSO ADDS A BUNCH OF MODULES TO THE GAME ONE OF WHICH IS A COMMODITY SYSTEM THAT WORKS DIFFERENTLY THAN THE STOCKS THOUGH SADLY I CANNOT REMEMBER HOW STILL IT DOES ADD MORE TYPES OF CURRENCIES TO THE GAME
HAVE YOU PLAYED PUERTO RICO IT'S NOT MULTIPLE CURRENCIES AS SUCH BUT IT DOES HAVE CASH VICTORY POINTS AND MULTIPLE RESOURCES

YOU USE BOTH CASH AND RESOURCES TO GET VICTORY POINTS AND THE RESOURCES ALSO GIVE YOU CASH THE CASH ALSO IMPROVES PRODUCTION THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES HAVE FIXED CASH VALUE BUT THE ACTUAL VALUE TO THE INDIVIDUAL CHANGES DEPENDING ON HOW YOU PLAY AND IMPORTANTLY HOW THE OTHER PLAYERS DO

FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU WANT IT LOOSELY FITS PLUS IT IS AN AWESOME GAME AND EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE IT A GO

CORE WORLDS HAS FIVE CURRENCIES AND HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES THERE ARE ACTIONS ENERGY GROUND STRENGTH AIR STRENGTH AND FACTION TOKENS

ACTIONS AND ENERGY ARE SPENT TO PERFORM TASKS IN THE GAME VERY NEARLY EVERYTHING YOU DO COSTS BOTH OF THEM AND A HUGE PART OF THE GAME IS EFFICIENT USE OF THESE TWO RESOURCES MOST THINGS WILL COST ONE ACTION AND AN AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT GENERALLY RANGES FROM EVERYONE GETS THE SAME NUMBER OF ACTIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH ROUND AND ENERGY IS GENERATED BY PLANETS YOU'VE CONQUERED YOU START WITH PER ROUND AND I'VE SEEN AS HIGH AS MID S ON THE LAST TURN NORMALLY IT'S AROUND

GROUND AND AIR STRENGTH ARE PROVIDED BUY COMBAT UNITS YOU HAVE DEPLOYED DEPLOYING COSTING ACTIONS AND ENERGY AND ARE SPENT TO CONQUER PLANETS FROM THE MARKET EACH UNIT TYPICALLY PROVIDES A COMBINED STRENGTH BUT IN THE LATE GAME THERE ARE SOME THAT CAN GO BEYOND THAT THE PLANETS REQUIRE ANYWHERE FROM ISH COMBINED AIR AND GROUND TO CLARIFY EACH UNIT HAS A SPECIFIC VALUE OF EACH IT PROVIDES WITH ABILITIES THAT CAN MODIFY THE VALUES BY SPENDING ACTIONS OR ENERGY WHEN THEY INVADE AND EACH PLANET REQUIRES A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF GROUND AND A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF AIR

FACTIONS TOKENS ARE INTRODUCED IN THE FIRST EXPANSION WHICH MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER REQUIRED AND ARE GAINED WHEN YOU DEPLOY A UNIT YOUR PURCHASED EARLIER NONE OF THE STARTER CARDS PROVIDE TOKENS THE FACTIONS SCORE BY MAJORITIES AT THE END OF THE GAME BUT YOU CAN ALSO SPEND THE TOKENS DURING PLAY FOR EFFECTS THAT VARY BASED ON THE FACTION

TL R CORE WORLDS HAS CURRENCIES AND REVOLVES HEAVILY AROUND THE EFFICIENT SPENDING OF THEM TO CONQUER THE MOST VALUABLE PLANETS
HAVE YOU TRIED ACQUIRE VERY INTERESTING TILE LAYING GAME DESIGNED BY THE GENIUS SID JACKSON IN THE STILL HOLDS UP VERY WELL TODAY YOU GET TO INVEST IN COMPANIES AND STAGE TAKEOVERS LOTS OF FUN I'D RECOMMEND PLAYERS BUT GOES FROM
JUST TO PREFACE I'VE PLAYED CCDS COMPETITIVELY FOR YEARS

LEARNING CURVE IS RATHER LOW FOR PICKING UP THE BASICS IF YOUR GROUP CAN PLAY MAGIC YOU SHOULD BE FINE A LOT OF THE STRATEGY HAS TO DO WITH THE ASSIGNMENT OF YOUR WARLORD WITH THE DIALS

2 THERE IS AN ALIGNMENT WHEEL THAT LIMITS WHAT FACTIONS CAN BE IN THE SAME DECK TOWARDS THE END OF MY TIME PLAYING I WAS ABLE TO BUILD DECKS THAT WERE RELATIVELY BALANCED WITH EACH OTHER
A LOT OF THE FUN CO
MES FROM THE EXPANSIONS MY GUT FEELING IS JUST WITH THE CORE SET A SINGLE CORE SET DOES NOT HAVE A FULL PLAYLET OF EVERYTHING LOTS OF SINGLETONS AND PAIRS AND BOTH DELUXE EXPANSIONS THAT THE TYRANNIDES WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER THAN THE OTHER FACTIONS LIKELY SAME IS TRUE WITH NEURONS YOU ALSO WOULD NOT HAVE MUCH VARIETY WITH JUST THOSE BOXES EITHER THE MINI EXPANSIONS INTRODUCE NEW WARLORDS WHICH IS WHERE A LOT OF THE VARIATION COMES FROM

ALL THIS SAID THE GAME IS VERY FUN I THINK YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OF GETTING A CORE SET OR TWO AND AN ENTIRE SET FFA CALLED THEM CYCLES OF EXPANSIONS

BE AWARE THAT IT'S BASICALLY A FINISHED GAME IF THERE'S ANY NEW RELEASES IT'LL JUST BE A COUPLE BEFORE IT'S DONE GOOD THING WITH A CG THOUGH IS THAT IT'S REASONABLE TO OWN EVERYTHING
CONQUEST WAS MY INTRODUCTION YO CARD GAMES I WAS A LONG TIME FAN SO WHEN A FRIEND CAME HOME WITH CONQUEST AND FORBIDDEN STARS I WAS HOOKED I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND CONQUEST IT DOES HOWEVER HAVE A STEEP LEARNING CURVE IN MY OPINION ONCE SOMEONE IN YOUR GROUP LEARNS HOW TO MANIPULATE THE PLANETS IN CHEIR FAVOR THEY WILL HAVE A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE ID RECOMMEND THE FIRST 2 CYCLES THE LAST CYCLE WAS SOLID BUT DEEP STRIKE WILL NEVER BE FLESHED OUT
THIS IS A GREAT GAME WITH SOME REALLY FUN MECHANICS AND A LOT OF FACTION VARIETY IN THE BASE BOX SOUNDS LIKE YOUR GROUP WOULD BE PERFECT FOR IT YES
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ROLL FOR THE GALAXY AND ARE LOOKING FOR A 2 PLAYER GAME I'D SUGGEST YOU LOOK INTO RACE FOR THE GALAXY INSTEAD THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR GAMES BUT 2 PLAYER VARIANT IS THE BEST WAY TO PLAY IT WHEREAS VARIANT IS PRETTY LACKLUSTRE
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY AND WONDERS DUEL ARE BOTH EXCELLENT WITH TWO PLAYERS ROLL IS IN MY OPINION BETTER THAN RACE AND CLEARLY SOME PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THE OPPOSITE HOWEVER I WOULD SUGGEST ROLL PURELY BECAUSE THE DICE MECHANIC FEELS DIFFERENT TO OTHER GOOD TWO PLAYER GAMES MANY OF WHICH ARE CARD BASED

I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST LOOKING AT IMPERIAL SETTLERS OR GUILDS OF LONDON GIVEN YOUR LIKES
ROLL IS GREAT IN MY OPINION BUT MY WIFE IS MORE LUKEWARM ON IT SHE LOVES VITICULTURE THOUGH HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THAT
MADEIRA IS GREAT GAME AS WELL AS WONDERS DUEL WHILE I DIDN'T LIKE TERRA MYSTIC WITH 2 PLAYERS CAN'T REMEMBER ABOUT PORTO RICO WITH 2 I THINK THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL ADDITIONAL RULES MAYBE WHILE THE ALLERGIST AND I HAVE BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED YET
OTHER THEN THOSE GAMES I'LL SUGGEST FEW OTHER IN MY OPINION REALLY GOOD TITLES WITH 2 THAT YOU CAN PLAY UNDER 2 HOURS
SHAKESPEARE
SNOWDONIA
LEWIS CLARK
SEASONS
SUBURBIA

TRAJAN


I SAY GET TZOLKIN AND ROLL PHENOMENAL GAMES THAT HIT ALL YOUR REQUIREMENTS
IT SOUNDS LIKE MY TASTES ARE SIMILAR TO YOURS I'D RECOMMEND TRAJAN AND TERRA MYSTIC MY WIFE AND I LOVE IT AS A TWO PLAYER GAME EVEN THOUGH I KNOW MANY WHO DO NOT

FOR AN INEXPENSIVE CHANGE OF PACE CHECK OUT THE RAVENS OF HRI SAHASHRI WE LOVE THAT ONE TOO VERY DEEP BUT QUICK AND INEXPENSIVE
AGRICOLA

LEWIS CLARK

SEASONS

RACE FOR THE GALAXY

ABOVE BELOW
I SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING FOR TWO PLAYERS

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY LOVE THIS GAME AND WORKS WELL WITH TWO PLAYERS I ENJOY LOOKING AT WHAT MY WIFE IS CURRENTLY DOING AND ANTICIPATING WHAT SHE MIGHT DO SO I CAN GET TWO ACTIONS INSTEAD OF ONE

WONDERS DUEL GREAT FILLER GAME THAT CAN BE PLAYED IN ABOUT MINS BETTER THIS FOR 2 PLAYERS THEN REGULAR WONDERS I WOULD SAY IT'S GREAT AS A QUICK GAME BETWEEN GAMES OR EVEN TO TAKE SOMEWHERE WE TOOK IT TO THE POOL WITH THE KIDS SWIMMING LESSONS

GREAT WITH TWO PLAYERS YOU RANDOMLY BLOCK OTHER SPACES IF YOU HAVE LESS THEN BUT WE BOTH REALLY ENJOY IT

THE ALLERGIST FANTASTIC GAME THAT I JUST LOVE BUT MY WIFE IS MPH ABOUT IT BASED ON THE THEME WORKS JUST GREAT TWO PLAYERS IT'S A GIANT PUZZLE REALLY NO LUCK IN THIS GAME BUT IT'S OOOO SATISFYING TO PLAY

ORLEANS ANOTHER GAME I REALLY LOVE THAT THE WIFE IS MPH ABOUT IT'S GREAT WITH TWO PLAYERS AS IT IS WITH



GAMES I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND FOR 2

IDLE OF SKYE IT'S A NICE LIKE CARCASSONNE LIKE GAME BUT THE BIDDING MECHANISM LOSES A LOT WITH ONLY TWO PLAYERS GREAT WITH THOUGH

NEW YORK GREAT SIMPLE GAME WITH PLAYERS BECAUSE IT MAKES THE BOARD REALLY TIGHT AND YOU CAN REALLY BLOCK EFFECTIVELY I CAN'T IMAGINE IT WOULD BE GOOD WITH TWO PLAYERS BECAUSE THE BOARD WOULD BE SO OPEN IT WOULD JUST FEEL DULL

TERRA MYSTIC IT'S A FANTASTIC GAME THAT I HONESTLY DON'T ENJOY WITH TWO PLAYERS THE BOARDS ARE SO BIG THAT UNLESS YOU INTENTIONALLY BUILD NEXT TO EACH OTHER THERE IS NOT MUCH GOING ON REALLY NEEDS BUT PREFERABLY PLAYERS

I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SUGGEST

FIELDS OF ARLE A FANTASTIC 2 PLAYER UWE ROSENBERG GAME IN THE FEEL OF AGRICOLA OR CAVERN LOTS OF CHOICES NO LUCK THERE CAN BE BLOCKING IN THE ACTIONS BUT USUALLY BOTH PLAYERS ARE DOING DIFFERENT THINGS THIS IS OUR GO TO 2 PLAYER GAME WHEN WE WANT SOMETHING MEATY SO ENJOYABLE WE BOTH LOVE IT ALTHOUGH YOU NEVER FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DIRECTLY COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER BUT INSTEAD TRYING TO DO BETTER THEN YOU DID LAST TIME

HOPE THIS HELPS
ISLE OF SKYE TZOLKIN PUERTO RICK MADEIRA AND TERRA MYSTIC AREN'T GREAT WITH 2 I THINK

ALLERGIST GREAT WESTERN TRAIL ISLEBOUND AND NEW YORK I DON'T KNOW

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY ORLEANS AND WONDERS UEL ARE SOLID CHOICES I GUESS YOU CAN GET ALL FOR

SEEMS LIKE YOUR TASTE IS PRETTY STANDARD EURO FAIR WHICH DOES WELL ON BG SO YOU CAN JUST SEARCH THERE TO RESEARCH YOUR GAMES I'D SAY I GUESS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOME MORE PERSONAL INFO ON WHY TO GET WHAT BUT I WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW WHICH OUT OF HUNDREDS OF EUROS YOU'D LIKE INSTEAD OF THE OTHERS

THE GAMES YOU SOLD AND GAMES YOU LOVE LOOK PRETTY SIMILAR TO ME WITH ONLY THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T LIKE COMPLEXITY TOO MUCH IT SEEMS WHICH WOULD REMOVE TERRA MYSTIC AND ESPECIALLY MADEIRA FROM YOUR LIST

I THINK A BG SEARCH FOR TOPGAMES FOR 2 PLAYERS WITH A COMPLEXITY BETWEEN 2 AND AND PLAYTIME UNDER MINS SHOULD SHOW YOU POTENTIAL GAMES ISTANBUL IMPERIAL SETTLERS STREET PETERSBURG AND NOTRE DAME MIGHT BE OTHER GAMES YOU LIKE

BUT FOR BETTER HELP YOU SHOULD SAY WHY YOU DIDN'T LIKE SOME GAMES AND WHY YOU LOVE YOUR FAVORITES
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY IS LIKE A MINUTE FILLER GAME ESPECIALLY WITH 2 MOST EUROS ARE GOING TO PLAY UNDER 2 HOURS WITH 2 PLAYERS

FROM YOUR LIST I'D SUGGEST TZOLKIN ORLEANS OR PUERTO RICO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FULL LEDGE BOARD GAME YOU CAN PLAY IN UNDER TWO HOURS WITH LOTS OF INTERESTING DECISIONS TO MAKE AS YOU GO ALONG
BIT OF A SNOWBALL IF PLAYERS AREN'T ON AN EQUAL LEVEL OR IF DICE FAVOR A PARTICULAR PLAYER BUT I ENJOY IT EVEN IF I LOSE
I HAVE HAD MY EYE ON THIS GAME BUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN A CHANCE TO PLAY IT YET I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOU OR OTHERS ELABORATE MORE ON WHAT YOU DID DID NOT LIKE ABOUT IT
PLAYED IT BEFORE BUT NEVER WITH 2 PLAYERS I CANNOT IMAGINE IT BEING A FUN 2 PLAYER GAME THOUGH BECAUSE OF ITS MECHANICS UNLESS IF YOU PLAYED WITH AN ALTERNATE VERSION WHERE YOU ARE PLAYING WITH ALL DRAGONS IN A
TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM AND ASK FOR AN EXCHANGE THEN OPEN THE NEW COPY IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP AND CHECK IT YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR SO THERE SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM EASILY SPOTTING THE SAME ISSUE FAILING THAT
2 TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE FOR A REFUND INVEST A FEW DOLLARS MORE AND ORDER SUSHI GO PARTY INSTEAD YOU MAY NOT HAVE IT FOR THANKSGIVING BUT YOU'LL HAVE THE SAME CORE GAME WITH A PLETHORA OF OPTIONS AND I WOULD THINK LESS OF A CHANCE OF THE SAME MANUFACTURING ERROR

BUT THAT'S ME
MY VERSION OF SUSHI GO PARTY THE TWO STACKS OF CARDS WHICH IT CAME WITH HAD DIFFERENT COLOURS THE GAME IS NOT REALLY EFFECTED BY IT ANY HOW
MY COPY IS THE SAME IT DOESN'T AFFECT GAMEPLAY TAKING IT BACK TO THE STORE ISN'T WORTH THE HASSLE LIKELY THE NEXT COPY YOU BUY WILL BE THE SAME AND YOU JUST WASTED TIME
RIGHT NOW THE STORE WOULDN'T REALLY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A FOOLPROOF SOLUTION THE UPSIDE IS THAT IT IS AN EXCHANGE A PREVIOUS POST IS RIGHT DO CHECK ON THE SPOT IF YOU CAN

WHAT I WOULD DO IS TAKE PICTURES THAT SHOW THE DIFFERENCE AND EMAIL GATEWRIGHT THIS IS FOOLPROOF BUT YOU HAVE TO WAIT ANYWHERE FROM A FEW DAYS TO A FEW WEEKS DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY SHIP REPLACEMENTS FROM JUST USE WHAT YOU HAVE WHILE WAITING

ALL THE BEST
YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE CODE ON THE BACK OF YOUR SUSHI GO TIN THERE WILL EITHER BE A V OR AN M LAST LETTER ABOVE THE BARCONE IT'S IMPORTANT TO MATCH THEM UP WHEN YOU BUY THE SOY SAUCE PROMO BECAUSE THERE WERE TWO DIFFERENT PRINT RUNS OF THE GAME
ITS MEANT TO BE A VERY CASUAL HIGHLY RANDOM IT DOESN'T NEED FIXING
INCORPORATE THE BOARD GAME PORTION OF THE CURRENT SMASH BROTHERS GAME THAT WOULD BE A WELCOME ADDITION
I HEAR THE LATEST INSTALLMENT ACTUALLY DOES FIX THINGS A LITTLE RATHER THAN HAVING A SINGLE PATH YOU ROLL DICE TO MOVE AROUND AN ISLAND PICKING UP TEAMMATES AND POWERUPS BEFORE YOU FACE OFF AGAINST BOWSER SO YOU HAVE TO WORK OUT HOW BEST TO USE YOUR DICE ROLLS TO WIND UP ON THE SPOTS YOU WANT TO EITHER GET STUFF OR DENY THEM TO YOUR OPPONENTS
LAST TIME I PLAYED MARIO PARTY THERE WAS A CAR THAT CARRIED EVERYONE AROUND A BOARD TOGETHER IS THERE STILL A CAR PLEASE GET RID OF THE CAR
DOES COUNT IF NOT THEN SINCE CARCASSONNE CAME MY WAY IN TOOK MY COPY ON HONEYMOON IT WENT ROUND THE WORLD WITH US PLAYED IT ON THE TRAIN THROUGH THE GOBI DESERT
LAST YEAR WIFE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO GET PANDEMIC SHE'S IN A MEDICAL FIELD SO THE THEME WAS EXCITING NOW WE HAVE A VERY STRONG COLLECTION OF HEAVY EUROS FOR US AND LIGHTER FARE FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
ABOUT TWO AND HALF YEARS I SOMEHOW STUMBLED INTO THIS SUB AND THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY COOL THAT THERE WERE SO MANY BOARD GAMES OUT THERE LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY AMAZON HAD ONE OF THE BETTER SALES I'VE EVER SEEN ON GAMES I PICKED UP THREE OR FOUR GAMES THAT LOOKED INTERESTING YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY I NOW HAVE A CLOSET SO FULL OF GAMES THAT I'LL NEED TO ADD MORE SHELVES SOON
ABOUT YEARS SINCE I TRIED CATAN AND I BOUGHT WITS WAGERS SOON AFTERWARD I BOUGHT MUNCHKIN AND THEN DISCWORLD THAT WAS IT UNTIL I PLAYED PANDEMIC IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR NOW I OWN OVER GAMES
STARTING SUMMER LAST YEAR
FIRST PLAYED CATAN IN HIGH SCHOOL OR BUT DIDN'T REALLY GET INVOLVED WITH MODERN GAMES UNTIL AROUND WITH MY UNIVERSITY'S GAMING CLUB THAT MAKES YEARS MY TASTES AND APPROACH TO GAMES HAS CHANGED A LOT IN THAT TIME AND SEEING THE 2 YEARS RESPONSES MAKES ME FEEL LIKE AN OLD MAN OF THE HOBBY
YEARS PLAYED A TRAVEL EDITION OF CATAN IN HIGH SCHOOL BAND CLASS CAUGHT THE BUG AND HAVEN'T LOOKED BACK FOR REFERENCE BACK THEN THE BIGGEST DESIGNER GAMES OTHER THAN CATAN WERE CARCASSONNE AND TIGRIS EUPHRATES
STARTED WITH CAVAN AND MARKHAM HORROR IN COLLEGE MY FIRST BUY WAS COMMANDS AND COLORS ANCIENTS
HELLO MY NAME IS CHR AND I'M A BOARD GAME ADDICT

OH NOT THAT KIND OF THREAD

I'D SAY YEARS I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY THAT IS
I WAS INTRODUCED TO CATAN AND BANG IN THE SUMMER OF GOT MY OWN COPY OF CATAN ON BOXING DAY OF THAT SAME YEAR AND THAT STARTED THE MADNESS I'M PROBABLY GOING TO BE HITTING GAME NUMBER THIS CHRISTMAS
SINCE ABOUT CATAN CARCASSONNE AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS HOOKED ME AND THEN I FOUND CGS AND ECONOMIC EUROS AND I WAS DONE FOR
I HAD BEEN PLAYING GAME OF THE THRONES THE BOARD GAME FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS WITH FRIENDS UNTIL I HAPPENED TO COME ACROSS SOMETHING LAST FALL THAT PUSHED DOWN THIS RABBIT HOLE I'VE SLOWED DOWN MY PURCHASES BUT BETWEEN KS AND RETAIL I'M AROUND GAMES AT FIRST I WENT A LITTLE CRAZY BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH TO GET AND EVERYTHING LOOKED COOL THEN I STARTED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I LIKED AND NOT TO FALL FOR EVERY COOL LOOKING KS AND MY SPENDING FOR A COUPLE MONTHS THERE WAS UNBALANCED
SINCE ABOUT
PROBABLY THREE MAJOR STAGES IN MY LIFE

MY OLDER BROTHER BRINGS HOME HEROQUEST AND WE BECOME OBSESSED

MAGIC THE GATHERING INTRODUCES US TO CCDS WHICH WE CONTINUE WITH ME PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON MAGIC LEGEND OF THE RINGS AND VS SYSTEM

I PLAY SETTLERS OF CATAN AND TICKET TO RIDE I FALL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE NOW I RUN A REVIEW BLOG AND PODCAST AND OWN GAMES

PROBABLY THREE MAJOR STAGES IN MY LIFE

MY OLDER BROTHER BRINGS HOME HEROQUEST AND WE BECOME OBSESSED

MAGIC THE GATHERING INTRODUCES US TO CCDS WHICH WE CONTINUE WITH ME PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON MAGIC LEGEND OF THE RINGS AND VS SYSTEM

I PLAY SETTLERS OF CATAN AND TICKET TO RIDE I FALL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE NOW I RUN A REVIEW BLOG AND PODCAST AND OWN GAMES

ABOUT YEARS

ONE OF THE FIRST I PLAYED WAS EURORAILS WHICH CAME OUT IN

ALSO PLAYED A LOT OF WIZWAR AND TRUMPET AROUND THAT TIME MODERN ART AND MASTER LABYRINTH

THEN ROBORALLY IN AND SETTLERS OF CATAN AND MEDICI IN

THEN THE FIELD EXPLODED AND BY WE WERE PLAYING EL GRANDE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES SAMURAI BONANZA FLUX UNSUPPLE THE GREAT DALMUTI KILL DR LUCKY AND GIVE ME THE BRAIN

AND SO IT GOES
I THINK AROUND YEARS AGO WHEN I GOT ZOMBIES FOR CHRISTMAS WELL OR TECHNICALLY A FEW YEARS MORE WITH MAGIC AND POKEMON
2 YEARS AGO I PLAYED CATAN AT A FRIENDS HOUSE HALF A YEAR LATER I DECIDED TO GET SOME MYSELF AND DISCOVERED R BOARDGAMES AND BG

BOUGHT CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AVALON DOMINION CARCASSONNE AND LOVE LETTER GOT PANDEMIC AND COSMIC ENCOUNTER MONTHS LATER PLANNING TO MAKE A NEW PURCHASE IN THE NEAR FUTURE JUST GOT TO MAKE A GOOD DECISION BECAUSE IT WILL BE MY LAST PURCHASE FOR A GOOD WHILE TO LIMIT MYSELF
I PLAYED A LOT OF RISK AND AXIS ALLIES AND SHOGUN IN THE S BUT THOSE DON'T NECESSARILY COUNT IN MOST PEOPLE'S MINDS NOT SURE IF M TG IN OR ROBORALLY AROUND COUNT EITHER SO IT BEEN WHEN WE STARTED PLAYING SETTLERS OF CATAN IN FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY RA AND CARCASSONNE
ABOUT YEARS NOW WE PULLED OUT A FRIENDS COPY OF ELECTRONIC DREAM PHONE AS A JOKE AT HER BIRTHDAY ONE TIME AND WITHIN A MONTH WE WERE PLAYING RA I STILL DON'T REMEMBER WHERE THE COPY OF RA CAME FROM AND NEITHER DOES SHE BUT HERE WE ARE MORE THAN A DECADE AND THOUSANDS OF WONDERFUL GAMES LATER

MAY THE GOLDEN AGE SHINE ON FOREVER
LONGER THAN THE PHRASE MODERN BOARD GAMES HAS BEEN IN USE
YEARS STARTED WITH CATAN DOMINION AND CARCASSONNE CAN'T GET A MORE STEREOTYPICAL STORY THAN THAT
ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF WENT TO A GAMES NIGHT AT A FRIENDS AND WE PLAYED CAPTAIN SONAR AND ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF AND I HAVE FALLEN FOR THE HOBBY HARD I'D NEVER REALISED BOARD GAMES OTHER THAN DIFFERENT THEMES MONOPOLY AND CLUED EXISTED BOUGHT TICKET TO RIDE MY OWN COPY OF ONUS AND DEAD PANIC FOR HALLOWEEN WE HAVEN'T PLAYED A FULL GAME YET KIND OF REGRET IT I'VE PLOUGHED THROUGH ALL OF TABLETOP WHICH I KNOW IS POLARISING HERE BUT IT'S A BRILLIANT GATEWAY SO THANK YOU U WIL BECAUSE I GET TO COME HOME FROM A STRESSFUL ASS JOB AND UNWIND AND LEARN ABOUT GAMES I CAN PUT IN MY MUST GET LIST HOW GOOD TODAY I BACKED MY FIRST KICKSTARTER TINY EPIC QUEST I GO TO MY LOCAL BOARD GAME CAFE HELD EVERY SECOND SUNDAY AS OFTEN AS I CAN MANAGE NEXT WEEK I'M GOING TO THE NEAREST CITY'S BOARD GAME FESTIVAL ALL DAY PLAYING NEW TO ME BOARD GAMES MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN GIVEN A WISH LIST OF GAMES IF THEY ARE STUMPED FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS AND I'M ALREADY HAVING TO LIMIT MYSELF TO A SINGLE GAME PURCHASE ON PAYDAY EACH MONTH OR I'LL BE IN FINANCIAL RUIN AND HAVE NO SPACE IN MY TINY BOX HOME TO MOVE I AM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW
I'VE BEEN PLAYING MODERN BOARD GAMES SINCE WHEN MY FRIEND INVITED ME TO A GAME BOARD DAY AT THE LIBRARY FIRST GAMES I PLAYED WERE PANDEMIC AND TICKET TO RIDE THEN CASTLE PANIC AND TAKENOKO I IMMEDIATELY BOUGHT CP AND TAKENOKO PLUS SMALL WORLD STONE AGE AND SEASONS IT'S BEEN DOWN HILL SINCE THEN NOW I OWN GAMES COUNTING EXPANSIONS
I PLAYED CATAN A BUNCH IN HIGH SCHOOL JUST ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO AND BANG A FEW TIMES IN COLLEGE BUT I DIDN'T REALLY GET INTO THE HOBBY IN EARNEST UNTIL LATE WHEN I STARTED GOING TO METUMPS I PRETTY MUCH JUMPED RIGHT I TO THE DEEP END PLAYING STUFF LIKE VANUATU SEASONS AND URBAN SPRAWL IN MY VERY FIRST NEETUP OR TWO I REMEMBER ALSO PLAYING SID BAZAAR AND ESCAPE THE CURSED TEMPLE AROUND THEN TOO GOOD TIMES
I'VE BEEN PLAYING BOARD GAMES JUST ABOUT EVERY WEEKEND SINCE I WAS OR WE STARTED ON SETTLERS RISK TICKET TO RIDE SO THATS ERR YEARS OR SO
IT IS NOW ABOUT YEARS SINCE I REALLY GOT INTO THE HOBBY PLAYED A FEW MODERN GAMES DURING THE YEARS PRIOR TO THAT BUT THEY WERE JUST A NOVELTY THING THAT I SOMETIMES DID AT PARTIES AT THE TIME AND BEFORE THAT I ENDED UP MORE INTO TABLETOP RAGS AND PRETTY MUCH KNEW NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT BOARD GAMES OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSICS
I'M CAN'T REMEMBER A TIME WHERE THERE WASN'T GAMING OF SOME TYPE IN MY LIFE BUT I SUPPOSE THIS MODERN ROUND KICKED UP IN OR SO
AS A BACKER MYSELF I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS GAME AND I HOPE THIS REVAMP OF THE DIALS GET PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT THE UNLOCKS ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM BACK AS WELL
I KEEP LOOKING AT THIS SAYING MAN THIS LOOKS NEAT AND I'VE HEARD PT IS A GREAT GAME AND I LIKE MEALMAN AS A NOSTALGIC HOLDOVER FROM MY CHILDHOOD AND ALL THAT BUT I ALSO HAVE GAMES THAT AREN'T GETTING TO THE TABLE NOW LIKE BATTLETOWN I'M NOT SURE WHERE THIS WOULD FIT INTO THE COLLECTION AS A RESULT SECOND IT'S A CROSS BETWEEN UNFORTUNATE AND AMUSING THAT THEY TRIED TO HOLD THE EXTRA CONTENT HOSTAGE AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK IN TERMS OF DRIVING BACKERS

THIS MADE ME REALIZE I NEED A GAME DAY
IT'S NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE YET IT WAS ONLY SENT TO THE PRINTER LAST WEEK IT'LL BE A COUPLE MONTHS BEFORE IT STARTS SHIPPING
KICKSTARTER HASN'T EVEN SHIPPED YET IT WILL BE AVAILABLE VIA THE DESIGNERS SITE DOWN THE ROAD HE ONLY SELLS DIRECTION

FWIW THE KICKSTARTER WAS SO IT'S NOT A HUGE PRICE DIFFERENCE
SO FAR TIM HAS NOT SOLD MUCH OUTSIDE OF HIS WEBSITE FOR ANY OF HIS GAMES THAT'S YOUR BEST BET FOR NOW
KS FULFILLMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED UNTIL JANUARY I THINK SO FOLLOWING TIM WEBSITE IS YOUR BEST BET
HAVE YOU PLAYED MANSIONS I OWN EVERY EXPANSION FOR ELDRITCH HORROR MANSIONS OF MADNESS AND I JUST PICKED UP MARKHAM HORROR CG AND PLAYED IT THIS WEEKEND AH IS NEAT BECAUSE IT'S PERSISTENT SO YOUR CHARACTER ACTUALLY GROWS FROM CAMPAIGN TO CAMPAIGN BUT BOY WAS THE LAST SCENARIO BRUTAL

IF YOU LIKE NARRATIVE PICK UP MOM AT FIRST I SCOFFED AT THE PRICE AND THOUGHT I DIDN'T NEED ANOTHER HOVERCRAFT GAME BUT IT'S SO GOOD I LOVE ELDRITCH TO DEATH BUT THE STORY NARRATIVE IS MUCH TIGHTER IN MANSIONS AND THE APP MAKES THE GAME SO SMOOTH AND FUN

THAT BEING SAID HAVE YOU TRIED PLAYING ELDRITCH WHERE YOU EACH CONTROL 2 CHARACTERS THE OTHER TIP WOULD BE TO NOT BE AFRAID OF DYING AND KILL THOSE MONSTERS AND CLOSE GATES BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF HAND I PLAYED A GAME LAST NIGHT OF IT WITH A NEW PLAYER AND WE FOUGHT AZATHOTH AND WON WITH LEFT ON THE DOOM TRACKER THEN AGAIN I HAVE ALL THE EXPANSIONS MIXED IN WHICH MIGHT CHANGE HOW MANY HARD OR EASY MYTHOS CARDS THAT GO IN THE DECK
PANDEMIC LEGACY
SECONDING PLAYING EH WITH 2 CHARACTERS EACH FORTUNE AND GLARY MIGHT WORK OR A TOUCH OF EVIL THOUGH IT'S CITY RATHER THAN GLOBE TROTTING
WE PLAY ELDRITCH AND ONLY PLAY CHARACTER EACH IT IS BRUTAL BUT WE DO STILL MANAGE TO WIN PROBABLY HALF OF THE TIME A LOT OF IT IS IN CHOOSING WHICH CHARACTERS ARE BEST AGAINST THE OLD ONE YOU'RE BATTLING AND MAKING SURE THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER ALSO DON'T BE AFRAID OF CHARACTERS DYING INSTEAD TRY TO PLAN IT SO YOUR NEW CHARACTER CAN START NEAR WHERE THE DEAD INSANE CHARACTER IS SO YOU CAN PICK UP THEIR CARDS EASILY

IF YOU LIKE THE STORY AND CHARACTERS OF ELDRITCH THE NEW MARKHAM HORROR CARD GAME WOULD BE GREAT FOR YOU TOO
THEY COULD BE GOOD FODDER FOR CONCEPT PROMPT CARDS

LIKEWISE YOU COULD USE THEM AS AN IMPROMPTU CODEINES GRID THOUGH YOU'D HAVE TO PROXY THE REST OF THE COMPONENTS NOTE THAT YOU CAN USE THE PHONE APP TO GENERATE A GRID CARD FOR THE PAYMASTERS
COULD PROBABLY USE THEM WITH TELESTRATIONS IF THE WORDS ON THE CARDS ARE STUFF YOU CAN DRAW IT CAN BE PLAYED WITHOUT BUYING IT IF YOU HAVE PEN AND PAPER
A GAME ABOUT PUNS

YOU COULD BURN THEM TO KEEP WARM THIS WINTER
YOU COULD PLAY CYRANO WITH THEM IN CYRANO PLAYERS ARE COLLECTIVELY GIVEN A THEME CARD AND TWO CARDS ING ODE EST AND WITH THIS INFORMATION MUST COMPOSE A FOUR-LINE POEM TWO RHYMING COUPLETS ONE FOR EACH GIVEN WORD ENDING ON THE GIVEN THEME

YOU COULD MAKE UP SOME CARDS YOURSELF AND USE A PAIR OF PUNDERDOME CARDS AS THE THEME TO ENSURE A MORE ENTERTAINING THEME THAN A RANDOM DRAW MIGHT GENERATE YOU COULD DEAL EACH PLAYER A HAND OF CARDS AND TAKE TURNS SELECTING A PAIR OR JUST USE SINGLE CARDS WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU

ANOTHER IDEA WOULD BE TO DEAL EVERYONE A PAIR OF CARDS AND USE THEM AS PROMPTS FOR TELESTRATIONS
THEY ALSO NEED THE EXPANSIONS
I GOT MINE FROM ESSEN AND NOTICED THE SAME ERROR HOWEVER I DIDN'T GET ANY STICKERS SO THIS MUST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION AFTERWARDS I'M GOING TO CONTACT CGE FOR A REPLACEMENT

TWO OF THE SEALS ARE WRONG MINE WERE THE YELLOW BLUE RIBBON WHICH HAD THE OPPOSITE COLOR ITS OTHER SIDE KIND OF CONFUSING I'M GUESSING YOU GET STICKERS TO STICK OVER THOSE WITH THE OPPOSITE COLORING IT'S ON THE SIDE SO SHOULDN'T BE NOTICABLE BY OTHER PLAYERS I HOPE
I THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH APPLE THAN HUMBLE BUNDLE I AM SURE HB WOULD GIVE YOU CODES AND STUFF TO GET THE GAMES ON IOS BUT APPLE NEEDS TO WORK WITH HB TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE
YOU COULD ALWAYS PICK UP THE HUMBLE BUNDLE AND THEN DOWNLOAD AN ANDROID EMULATOR THEY HAVE THEM FOR WINDOWS COMPUTERS AND TABLETS THAT CAN HELP YOU WITH YOUR FIX

BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IOS WORKS YOU PROBABLY WON'T SEE ANY BUNDLES FOR IT
APPLE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING LIKE HUMBLE SO THEY WILL NEVER SUPPORT IT

BEST BET GO ON TWITTER AND SEARCH FOR APP SALE TO FIND WHAT'S CHEAP

IS ALWAYS ON TOP OF THOSE
USUALLY WHEN THEY NEED YOUR HELP FINDING A GAME THEY'RE GATEWAY GAMERS HOBBY GAMERS WHO DOES MEDIUM TO HEAVIER GAMES DON'T NEED YOUR HELP BECAUSE THEY ALREADY RESEARCH THIS STUFF THEMSELVES
MY GENERAL RULE PRIMARILY AT MEET UPS IS TO ASK PEOPLE WHAT THEIR FAVORITE GAME IS IF THEY SAY EXPLODING KITTENS IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE LEVEL THAN SOMEONE WHO SAYS PANDEMIC OR CHICAGO EXPRESS OR CHURCHILL
ME OH GREAT SO DO YOU GUYS LIKE THEMATIC GAMES OR DO YOU LOOK FOR MECHANICS AND HOW THE GAME PLAYS

NO THE FIRST QUESTION NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE OR THEIR LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE IS SO WHAT GAMES DO YOU LIKE
I USUALLY NAIL THE HAMMER ON THE NAIL WHAT COLONIAL VERSION OF HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
UNLESS THEY HAVE A BEARD RULE OF THUMB BEARDS ARE HARDCORE
I'M CONFUSED YOU SAY YOU SAW THEM GRABBING EVERY GAME I SUGGESTED SO THEY BOUGHT THOSE GAMES

SO THEY LIKED THEM WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE
ASK THEM THE LAST THREE GAMES THEY'VE PLAYED AND WORK FROM THERE IF THEY CAN'T NAME THEM OR HAVEN'T PLAYED THAT MUCH YOU CAN GET A GOOD IDEA OF WHERE THEY ARE AT IF THEY CAN AT LEAST DESCRIBE SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OR WHAT THEY DID YOU CAN HELP THEM
GOOD TAKE AWAY LESSON


I WAS CHATTING WITH A NEW CO-WORKER ONCE AND SOMEONE HAD MENTIONED HOW INTO BOARD GAMES I AM SO THE NEW CO-WORKER IS GUSHING ABOUT HOW MUCH SHE LOVES BOARD GAMES TO I ASK HER WHAT HER FAVORITE ONE IS HOPING FOR A KINDRED SPIRIT SHE TAKES SEVERAL BEATS TO CONSIDER THEN DECLARES MONOPOLY I ASK OH YEAH WHERE YOU PUT MONEY ON FREE PARKING SHE SAYS OF COURSE I FINISH UP THE SMALL TALK NICELY ENOUGH WHILE INTERNALLY LAUGHING ABOUT HOW EVEN PERCEIVED NERD CULTURE HAS POSERS NOW


ON THE FLIP SIDE I ASKED FOR A SPECIFIC GAME FROM A FAGS CLERK ONE-TIME CAUSE I COULDN'T FIND IT ON THE SHELVES THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT I SAID IT WAS TO BAD CAUSE I FIGURED MY BF WOULD HAVE ENJOYED IT THE CLERK TAKES THIS AS A HINT THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR GATEWAY STUFF AND STARTS TO RATTLE OFF A LIST OF GAMES I WAVED THE CLERK OFF WHILE LAUGHING STATING THAT I WAS A REGULAR GAMER AND ALREADY KNEW ALL THAT STUFF
I'M WORRIED ABOUT GETTING RULES WRONG FINDING OUT YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING SOMETHING VERY WRONG CAN RUIN A GAME SESSION FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS
A RELATIVELY FAIR REVIEW

I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT

THE RULEBOOK ITSELF IS NOT TERRIBLY WRITTEN BUT IT IS FINICKY AND WE'VE FOUND EVEN THE STARTING RULES HARD TO KEEP IN OUR BRAINS THIS MANY GAMES IN

NOT TERRIBLY FAR IN BUT THE STARTING RULES WERE VERY MORE REPETITIVE THAN DIFFICULT THEY ARE A BIT LONG THOUGH

PERSONALLY I RECOMMEND HAVING ONE PERSON THE BEST RULES PERSON OF THE GROUP READ THE RULE BOOK AND EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD JUST WATCH THROUGH THE HOW TO PLAY VIDEO UNTIL THEY NEED TO LOOK SOMETHING UP
QUITE A GOOD REVIEW

SOMEHOW THE GAME HAS BEEN SHACKLED TO THE MISCONCEPTION THAT IT S STRICTLY A CHINKY EUROGAME

I'D LOVE TO KNOW HOW THAT GOT STARTED
WHAT DETRACTORS MISS IN MY OPINION IS THE VERY POINT OF THE GAME SOMEHOW THE GAME HAS BEEN SHACKLED TO THE MISCONCEPTION THAT IT S STRICTLY A CHINKY EUROGAME IN REALITY DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU COLLECT AND SELL COLORED CUBES REPRESENTING GOODS IT'S ANYTHING BUT SEAWALL IS A GRAND EXERCISE IN COMMUNAL STORYTELLING A SHARED JOURNEY INTO THE BAROQUE

I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE AUTHOR GETS THIS FROM THE DICE TOWER SU SD AND OTHERS HAVE ALL COMPLAINED SPECIFICALLY THAT THE STORY AND LEGACY ASPECTS WERE TOO SLOW AND UNINTERESTING AND THAT THE GAME ITSELF WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO CARRY THE EXPERIENCE THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO IGNORE THE FIRST HALF OF THE COMPLAINT TO DISMISS THE SECOND BUT THE FIRST PART IS ESSENTIAL IF REVIEWERS FELT THE LEGACY PARTS OF SEAWALL WERE STRONG THEN I'M SURE IT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A POSITIVE REVIEW
THE FIRST FEW GAMES ARE FUN THEN YOU START ADDING SHIT AND IT GOES DOWNHILL QUICK TO BE FAIR I ONLY PLAYED IT DURING PLATIEST BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT CHANGED MUCH IT STARTS FUN BUT THEN THE GAME JUST CAN'T MAINTAIN
I HATE THESE REVIEWS THAT BASICALLY SAY THAT OTHER REVIEWERS GOT IT WRONG EACH THEIR OPINION SO FAR MOST REVIEWS I READ ARE VERY NEGATIVE AND THIS REVIEW ALSO FEELS LIKE A BUNCH OF NEGATIVES BUT WE LOVE IT ANYWAY

I'LL BE SKIPPING THIS GAME AND PROBABLY THIS REVIEWER TOO
I IT BUT HAVEN'T PLAYED YET IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW MUCH OF THE CRITIQUES ARE BECAUSE IT WAS SO HOTLY ANTICIPATED LIKE IS IT A DECENT GAME THAT JUST DIDN'T DELIVER ON HOW AMAZING PEOPLE EXPECTED ARE WE JUST MAD TO LEARN THAT ROB DAVIDA IS A MERE MORTAL
ARE THERE ANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW I HAVEN'T READ THE COMMENTS HERE YET OR THE ARTICLE AS I'M A BIT NERVOUS ONLY GAMES IN AT THIS POINT BUT I'M CURIOUS WHAT THIS REVIEW SAYS
TOO BAD THE GAME COST ALMOST THREE TIME MORE EXPENSIVE IN MY COUNTRY THANKS TO SHIPPING COST AND IMPORT TAX

WOULD LOVE TO PLAY IT

ANY OTHER ESSENTIALS I SHOULD PICK UP NOTHING TOO HEAVY BECAUSE OF THE GROUP I PLAY WITH I WAS THINKING LOVE LETTER COULD BE GOOD FOR ABOUT



WAS ABOUT TO SHELL OUT FOR TICKET TO RIDE EUROPE LAST WEEKEND THANK GOODNESS I DECIDED TO PICK UP EPIC SPELL WARS INSTEAD THAT WAY I CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE SWEET DEALS
HOWS HOKKAIDO
DO THEY SHIP TO THE NETHERLANDS
FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO ORDERING OR 2 GAMES TURNS OUT IT'S STORE ONLY
JUST TRIED THIS THEY WOULD NOT PRICE MATCH THEIR OWN WEBSITE AND HONOR THE OFFICIAL
GREAT FIND OP GOT FLUX LOVE LETTER AND CODENAMES
BLOOD RAGE IS IN THERE
WONDERS IS JESUS I OVERPAID FOR THAT GAME LIKE HELL
I JUST PICKED UP MICE MYSTICS FOR WITH THE RED CARD

NICE PICKED UP THREE GAMES FOR THE KIDS FOR CHRISTMAS
I WAS TRAVELLING YESTERDAY AND DIDN'T SEE THIS I'M VERY SAD NOW
WHY CAN I NOT FIND FIVE TRIBES PERHAPS IT'S SOLD OUT WAS IT AN ONLINE ONLY OFFER I'M HOPING TO PICK SOMETHING UP TO PLAY TODAY LEANING TOWARD SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM INSTEAD
JUST SNAGGED CONCORDIA SALSA FOR THAT'S A GREAT DEAL
ANYONE TRY THIS OUT AT ESSEN THE WAY DICE ARE USED SEEMS VERY COOL
I WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS GAME UNTIL NOW
LOOKS REALLY GOOD THANKS
ABOUT TO CONTINUE WATCHING THE EXTENDED VIDEO THE LOOKING VERY GOOD THUS FAR
THAT BOX ART THOUGH JEEZ AND PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT ANIS
WELL CURRENTLY A NEW COPY OF SMALL WORLD IS UNDER TWENTY FIVE BUCKS FOR ANOTHER HOUR AT TARGET WITH CODE PLAY POSSIBLY A COUPLE HOURS LONGER ON AMAZON IF THAT HELPS YOU MAKE A DECISION YOU COULD ALWAYS SELL YOUR CURRENT COPY WITH BROKEN BOX FOR A LITTLE CASH AND COME AWAY WITH A PERFECT COLLECTION WORTHY COPY THEN FOR BARELY NOTHING

BUT YOU MIGHT JUST LOOK FOR ANY BOX ONLY EBAY SALES BECAUSE SMALL WORLD USES THE BASIC SQUARE SIZED BOX YOU COULD PAINT IT UP AND JUST SLIDE THE INSERTS IN

ETA YOU COULD ALSO CONTACT THE PUBLISHER THEY OFTEN BREAK OPEN RETAIL COPIES FOR REPLACEMENT PARTS AND BOXES ARE THE LEAST REQUESTED
JUST GO TO THE DOLLAR STORE OR A CONTAINER STORE AND GET A CHEAP BOX THAT WILL HOLD IT IF THE LABEL IS STILL INTACT PASTE THAT ON THE OUTSIDE SOME PEOPLE DO THIS INTENTIONALLY TO THEIR WHOLE COLLECTIONS TO SAVE SPACE
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BUILDING A NEW BOX I'LL LINK A HELPFUL THREAD FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO

R BOARDGAMES COMMENTS
R BOARDGAMES COMMENTS
IF YOU LOVE THE GAME I WOULD BUY A NEW COPY IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE
I THINK IF THE COMPONENTS DIDN'T COME DAMAGED IT ISN'T A CANDIDATE FOR THE WORST INSERT EVER
HEY CV DOESN'T GET ENOUGH LOVE I REALLY ENJOY THE GAME FOR SOMETHING PRETTY FAST AND LIGHT

I DON'T REALLY THINK THE INSERT IT COMES WITH IS THAT BAD THOUGH TSH IT OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T COMPARE TO WHAT YOU'VE CREATED BUT AT LEAST IT KEEPS EVERYTHING HALF SEPARATED WITHOUT A BUNCH OF ZIP LOCK BAGS TO OPEN EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO PLAY

YOURS IS AWESOME
VERY NICE INSERT HOW DOES CV PLAY WITH 2 PLAYERS
I SEE FROM THAT CLOSE UP OF THE DICE PICTURE THAT YOU USED THE CUT TWO ALTERS AND OVERLAP THE FINAL CARDBOARD TECHNIQUE VERY NICE

I'M INTERESTED IN HOW YOU GET A GOOD RIGHT ANGLE BECAUSE THAT'S MY MAJOR CONCERN WHEN I TRIED TO MAKE AN INSERT I GET PARANOID THAT MY ANGLES AREN'T RIGHT AND I ENDED UP WITH A SQUARE BASE THAT WASN'T EXACTLY SQUARE
REMINDS ME OF THE OUTFOXED BOX THAT THING COULD BE CUT IN HALF
YOU CAN FIT EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE RULES AND THE BOARD IN A RATHER SMALL REALLY USEFUL BOX
IT'S REALLY AMERICAN TO GIVE GAMES A BOX WHICH IS WAY TOO BIG

MACHI BORO IS A GREAT EXAMPLE THE JAPANESE EXPANSIONS COME IN A SMALL TOUCHBOX SLIGHTLY BIGGER THAN THE CARDS THEMSELVES THE USA VERSION FITS A SMALL CAR
TO BE HONEST IF YOUR HUSBAND ISN'T HUGE INTO THE HOBBY YET I WOULD PERSONALLY SKIP MOST OF THE GAMES YOU ARE INTERESTED IN GLOOM DOESN'T OFFER UP THAT MUCH REPLACEABILITY ESPECIALLY AT 2 PLAYERS WARHAMMER TCG IS SOLID AND IF YOU LIKE THAT I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST BLUE MOON LEGENDS LORD OF THE RINGS CG OR EVEN THE NEW MARKHAM HORROR CG ELDRITCH HORROR IS NOT THAT BAD AS LONG AS ONE PLAYER KNOWS THE RULES BUT JUST BE WARNED THAT IT'S A GAME WITH A LOT OF MOVING PIECES IT'LL ACTUALLY WORK PERFECTLY FINE AS LONG AS YOU ARE COMMITTED TO UNDERSTANDING THE GAME AND I WOULD ALSO CONSIDER RUNEBOUND IN THE SAME POOL OF GAMES AS EH BUT WITH A SLIGHT NOD TOWARDS HOW MAGE KNIGHT IS

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 2 PLAYER GAMES WITH WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR I WOULD PERSONALLY SUGGEST BARE IN MIND THAT I'M KEEPING YOUR HUSBAND IN MIND IN TERMS OF DIFFICULTY

PATHFINDER ADVENTURE CARD GAME
LORD OF THE RINGS THE CARD GAME ALREADY SUGGESTED ABOVE
MARKHAM HORROR THE CARD GAME ALREADY SUGGESTED ABOVE
BLUE MOON LEGENDS ALREADY SUGGESTED ABOVE

ALSO IF BUDGET IS AN ISSUE I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST CHECKING OUT THESE 2 PLAYER GAMES SINCE THEY ARE GREAT OPTIONS TO HAVE WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE MINUTES OR UNDER TO PLAY AND WANT TO SPEND UNDER FOR A GAME

ONITAMA
PATCHWORK
MR JACK OR ALMOST ANY OF THE MR JACK GAMES
LOST CITIES

EDIT OOPS FORGOT TO MENTION YOUR INTEREST IN DEAD OF WINTER FOR 2 PLAYERS I WOULD DEFINITELY SKIP THAT ONE I PERSONALLY WOULDN'T EVEN PLAY THAT GAME UNTIL YOU HAVE AT LEAST PLAYERS PLUS THE RULES ARE SURPRISINGLY A BIT HEAVIER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IT'S STILL A SOLID GAME BUT NOT A GREAT CHOICE FOR YOUR SITUATION
I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM DEAD OF WINTER IT DOESN'T PLAY WELL WITH TWO I DO ENJOY ELDRITCH HORROR WITH TWO THOUGH
FANTASY FLIGHT IS HAVING A HOLIDAY SALE AND THEIR GAMES ARE RIDICULOUSLY CHEAP RIGHT NOW GO TO THEIR WEBSITE SITE AND PICK UP A FIVE GAMES INSTEAD OF TWO
THAT'S WHAT I JUST DID
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I LOVE TO PLAY ELDRITCH HORROR TOGETHER SO O DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT ONE THOUGH IT IS RECOMMENDED YOU GET ONE OF THE SMALL EXPANSIONS TO GO ALONG WITH IT SO THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH ENCOUNTER CARDS TO KEEP THINGS FRESH
OF THOSE I WOULD GO WITH ELDRITCH HORROR DON'T LET THE RULE ION INTIMIDATE YOU MECHANICS ARE RELATIVELY STRAIGHT FORWARD PLAYS WELL WITH 2 AND SCALES WELL WITH MORE

GLOOM NEEDS THE RIGHT CROWD IF YOU PLAY IT AT FACE VALUE IT'S A PRETTY BORING GAME IF YOU PLAY WITH A GROUP OF STORYTELLERS OR RPG FANS IT COMES ALIVE IN THE STORIES TOLD ACROSS THE TABLE IT'S NOT AS FUN WITH 2 EITHER

DEAD OF WINTER IS A IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BEFORE I WOULD SUGGEST PLAYING A FEW ROUNDS WITH A GAME STORE DEMO IT'S MUCH HARDER WITH ONLY 2 IT CAN BE COMPLEX IF YOU DON'T GAME A LOT AND IT TENDS TO BE POLARIZING BC OF SABOTAGE AND SECRET MISSIONS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO END UP ANGRY WITH EACH OTHER MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TEMPERAMENT TO PLAY I LOVE IT MY FIANCE HATES IT SO IT SITS ON OUR SHELF

A SIMILAR THEME TO DEAD OF WINTER THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS POLARIZING IS ZOMBICIDE AND THE BLACK PLAGUE EXPANSION IT'S QUITE FUN
OH IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR CHEAP AND FUN FOR 2 PLAYERS WITH REPLAY FACTOR THEN AEC DOES NO MAKE A BAD GAME

SMASH UP AND IT'S ZILLION EXPANSIONS ARE ALWAYS REALLY FUN LOVE LETTER IS A QUICK PLAYING CLASSIC THAT WE LOVE TO PLAY WITH LOTS OF THEMATIC VARIANTS BATSMAN LOAR ETC MAI STAR IS REALLY FUN TOO

FLUX IS FUN A HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THEMED DECKS AND PROMO CARDS AND IT RARELY EVER PLAYS THE SAME WAY LOONY LABS MAKES GREAT GAMES AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD

IF YOU LIKE BLUFFING GAMES COUP IS NICE AND CAN BE PLAYED WITH 2 THOUGH BE CAREFUL NOT TO BURN YOURSELF OUT ON IT

A LOT OF THESE MAY BE CHEAP ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN BUY A BIG GAME FROM YOUR LIST AND A FEW OF THESE CARD GAMES AND HAVE MORE OPTIONS TO WORK WITH TOO
THROWING MY ADVICE TOO THAT ELDRITCH HORROR IS GREAT WITH 2 YOU CAN EACH CONTROL TWO CHARACTERS OR MORE AS DESIRED

SINCE YOU'RE MORE EXPERIENCED WITH BOARD GAMES YOU CAN HANDLE THE HOUSEKEEPING WHICH MAKES IT MORE MANAGEABLE FOR PEOPLE WITH LESS EXPERIENCE LIKE YOUR HUSBAND


GOTTA DO THE OBLIGATORY PLUG FOR TWILIGHT STRUGGLE THE GAME THAT WAS MADE TO BE PLAYED REPEATEDLY AGAINST THE SAME OPPONENT THOUGH I GUESS THE JURY'S OUT ON HOW CONVOLUTED IT IS PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE BUT I WAS ALSO THE KID WHO READ THE MAGIC COMPREHENSIVE RULES IN HIS SPARE TIME SO

OF THE ONES ON YOUR LIST I'D SAY ELDRITCH HORROR WITH THE CAVEAT THAT I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT AM A HUGE FAN OF ITS PREDECESSOR MARKHAM HORROR AND THAT'S AN INFINITELY REPAYABLE ROMP THAT WORKS GREAT WITH TWO ALBEIT WITH EACH PLAYER RUNNING TWO CHARACTERS AND ALWAYS LEADS TO INTERESTING STORIES SO I CAN ONLY ASSUME ELDRITCH IS SIMILAR
I'M STILL NOT SURE I'VE FOUND A BOARDGAME THAT IS FAIRLY BIG AND PLAYS REPEAT VALUE BETWEEN 2 PLAYERS

THE ONES I'VE FOUND IMMENSE VALUE FOR MONEY ARE

ONITAMA 2 PLAYER
CODENAMES IDEALLY PLAYER

I GUESS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEME SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE MIGHT DO ALSO
OH HOW COULD I FORGET FORTUNES AND GLORY IT'S PURE AMERITRUST GLORY WITH SO MANY PIECES YOU CAN PLAY COOP AGAINST THE NAZIS OR THE MOB OR BOTH YOU CAN PLAY PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER WHILE ALSO DEALING WITH NAZIS MOB ETC OR FOR LARGER SCALE YOU CAN PLAY TEAMS DIFFERENT CHARACTERS HAVE DIFFERENT STATS AND ABILITIES THE THEME IS AWESOME IT'S VERY INDIANA JONES MEETS THE NAZIS DON'T LET THE PIECE COUNT INTIMIDATE YOU THE MECHANICS ARE SIMPLE IT'S GOOD DICE AND STRATEGY AND SO FAR IT HAS PLAYED DIFFERENTLY EVERY TIME BC YOU CAN PICK WHO TO BATTLE AND WHAT TO INCLUDE AND WHICH CHARACTERS YOU USE IT CAN EVEN BE PLAYED SOLO
IF YOU HAVE LIMITED FUNDS AND CAN'T BUY ANYTHING ELSE FOR A WHILE THEN STAY AWAY FROM ANY COLLECTIBLE GAMES LIKE WARHAMMER TCG I HAVEN'T PLAYED THAT ONE BUT GENERALLY YOU NEED TO BUY A FAIR FEW EXPANSIONS TO MAKE THE DECKBUILDING INTERESTING

ELDRITCH HORROR IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES AND PLAYS WELL WITH 2 IF YOU CONTROL 2 INVESTIGATORS EACH HOWEVER I WOULD SAY YOU NEED THE FIRST SMALL BOX EXPANSION FORSAKEN LORE AS THERE AREN'T ENOUGH CARDS IN THE BASE GAME YOU WILL QUICKLY START COMING ACROSS THE SAME CARDS THE FIRST EXPANSION JUST ADDS A LOT OF MUCH NEEDED REPLACEABILITY TO THE BASE GAME
BATTLESHIP GALACTICA IS ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THIS AND THE GAME STANDS ON ITS OWN IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE THEME
DUNE THE ORIGINAL EXAMPLE OR IT'S IMPLEMENTATION UNDER ANOTHER IP REX FINAL DAYS OF AN EMPIRE

BOTH USE AN EXISTING IP BUT REX S IP IS BASED ON ANOTHER BOARD GAME
SPARTACUS SONS OF ANARCHY HOMELAND LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN PREDATOR AWE SHOWDOWN SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE UNCHARTED GEARS OF WAR DOOM
PILLARS OF THE EARTH

NOT REALLY HIDDEN GEMS BUT STILL VERY GOOD IP

STAR WARS IMPERIAL ASSAULT IT'S STAR WARS ADVENTURES IN A BOX AND THE SKIRMISH MODE IS PRETTY GOOD TOO
CONAN MAYBE A STECH BUT THE GAMEPLAY IS SOLID AND THE GAME IS VERY FAITHFUL TO THE ORIGINAL STORIES BY ROBERT EAST HOWARD
I COME FROM THE EURO ZONE WHERE EXISTING AREN'T USED AS A BASIS FOR THE THEME VERY OFTEN BUT ONE THAT STICKS OUT IN MY HEAD IS THE STEFAN FELD GAME THE NAME OF THE ROSE BASED ON THE UMBERTO ECO NOVEL OF THE SAME NAME IT'S A WONDERFUL GAME BASED ON A REALLY GOOD NOVEL AND A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE


GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME IS THE ONLY GAME I'VE PLAYED BASED ON A PREVIOUS IP SO FAR BUT IT HAS UNIVERSAL ACCLAIM WITH A FEW CAVEATS IT IS AN AWESOME BOARD GAME ADAPTATION THAT CAPTURES THE FEEL AND SPIRIT OF THE IP
I SEE NOBODY MENTIONED BCOM THE GAME SO I'M TOSSING THAT IN

AND OF COURSE FIREFLY THE GAME
FOR ME MACHS VS MINIONS STAR TREK ASCENDANCY SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE MYTHOS TALE A STUDY OF EMERALD
IS THERE A REASON BCOM ISN'T NAMED I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY PLAYED IT BUT I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS
NOT EXACTLY HIDDEN BUT PRETTY MUCH ALL THE GW FFA GAMES WERE PRETTY GOOD WELL EXCEPT TALISMAN AND SPACE TALISMAN BUT EVEN THOSE WERE ALRIGHT FOR DICKING AROUND WITH FRIENDS
I'M NOT SURE HOW HIDDEN IT IS BUT THE SPARTACUS BOARD GAME FROM GALE FORCE IS SHOCKINGLY GOOD CONSIDERING THE IP IT'S BASED ON
FANTASY FLIGHT HAS SEVERAL GOOD STAR WARS GAMES REBELLION ARMADA IMPERIAL ASSAULT AND THEIR RPG LINES ARE ALL EXCELLENT I'M NOT BIG ON THE CG THOUGH AND DESTINY HASN'T BEEN RELEASED YET

BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA DESERVES A MENTION HERE

GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME AND GAME OF THRONES THE CARD GAME 2ND EDITION ARE BOTH GREAT INTERPRETATIONS OF UNIVERSE

SONS OF ANARCHY IS SURPRISINGLY GOOD

WHILE IT'S NOT DEEP AWE SUPERSTAR SHOWDOWN IS INCREDIBLY GOOD AT CAPTURING THE THEME AND MAKING FOR A VERY FUN QUICK GAME I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAME DESIGNS I'VE EVER SEEN AND IT'S A SHAME THAT IT DIDN'T CATCH ON REALLY BIG AS I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE MORE EXPANSIONS AND WRESTLERS FOR IT
WAR OF THE RING
HARRY POTTER HOGWARTS BATTLE
BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER
CTHULHU WARS
STAR TREK FLEET CAPTAINS

I JUST FOUND OUT MY FATHER OWNS A COPY OF THE XANTHA BOARD GAME BASED ON THE SERIES OF NOVELS BY PIERS ANTHONY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT PLAYS LIKE BUT I'M GOING TO DIG THROUGH THE RULEBOOK AND REPORT BACK
BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD BEFORE THAT ONE I SAID IP SHITTY GAME

MANSIONS OF MADNESS
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW ACCLAIMED STAR WARS GAMES OUT THERE
SCYTHE THE BEST PART ABOUT IT IS THE BEAUTIFUL ART AND SETTING DEVELOPED BY THE ARTIST AND LICENSED BY STONEMAIER GAMES

MY PERSONAL CHOICE WOULD BE A GAME OF THRONES CG IT'S MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME SUPER THEMATIC AND RESPECTFUL OF THE SOURCE MATERIAL AND CHARACTERS AND JUST A GREAT GAME ALL AROUND
GEARS OF WAR HARD TO FIND NOW THOUGH AS IT'S BEEN OUT OF PRINT FOR A WHILE
THE BIG BOX WITH THE AND 8TH PLAYERS HAS COME AND GONE CONSIDERING THE NEW VERSION OF CARCASSONNE WITH NEW ART IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW AND THEY HAVEN'T DONE MANY OF THE EXPANSIONS YET IT COULD BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE SEE ANOTHER BIG BOX EDITION ACQUISITION OF WHICH INCLUDES COULD SHAKE THINGS UP AS WELL
I BOUGHT THE BIG BOX LAST YEAR RIGHT BEFORE THEY WENT OUT OF STOCK AT AMAZON BEFORE THE PRICE HIKE I WAS LUCKY WISH THEY STILL SOLD EXPANSIONS WITH THE OLD ART THOUGH MY F AND I REALLY WANT THE PRINCESS THE DRAGON ONE
NICE WHERE DID YOU GET THE FOAM FROM

PERSONALLY I PREFER IMPERIAL ASSAULT

IA HAS TWO GAME MODES AN RPG IN A BOX CAMPAIGN STORYTELLING MODE WHERE TO PLAYERS PLAY THE REBELS AGAINST AN EMPIRE PLAYER AND A COMPETITIVE SKIRMISH MODE THAT IS USUALLY PVP BUT HAS SOME MAPS THAT CAN BE PLAYED OR

IN CAMPAIGN MODE YOU ARE SAVING THE GALAXY PLAYING LITTLE KNOWN CHARACTERS AND OCCASIONALLY GETTING HELP FROM HAN LEIA LUKE CHEWIE LANDO MOST GAMES FOR MY GROUP TOOK BETWEEN AN HOUR AND TWO HOURS MOST STORIES IN THE CAMPAIGN ARE TIMED

IN SKIRMISH MODE YOU HAVE A MISSION WITH SOME OBJECTIVE AND YOU ARE TRYING TO GET THE MOST POINTS BY COMPLETING THE OBJECTIVE AND DESTROYING THE OTHER PLAYER IN OTHER WORDS A PRETTY TYPICAL MINIS GAME COMPETITIVE PLAY IS TIMED TO ABOUT AN HOUR AND WHERE IN THE CAMPAIGN YOU ARE TRYING TO BUILD AN EFFECTIVE TEAM WITH EQUIPMENT AND SKILL BUFFS WITH YOUR TEAM IN SKIRMISH YOU ARE BUILDING TEAMS WITH A SET POINT LIMIT SO YOUR TEAM COULD BE AS SMALL AS OR FIGURES OR VERY VERY LARGE AND A SET OF BUFF CARDS THAT YOU DRAW FROM THAT LET YOU DO THINGS YOU COULDN'T NORMALLY DO


REBELLION IS A GAME THOUGH YOU CAN SPLIT IT INTO IF YOU WANT IT TAKES MANY HOURS TO PLAY IT IS FAR MORE ASYMMETRICAL THAN IA STARTING OUT IT IS VERY EASY FOR THE EMPIRE TO EXPAND THEIR FLEET AND ARMY AND DIFFICULT FOR THE REBELLION TO DO SO AND DIFFICULT FOR THE REBELLION TO FULFILL MISSIONS IT JUST DIDN'T WORK FOR ME
I PERSONALLY WOULD RATHER PLAY REBELLION BUT IMPERIAL ASSAULT IS A BIT MORE EASIER TO GET TO THE TABLE WITH THE RULES AND GAME LENGTH PLUS THERE ARE A TON OF EXPANSIONS ALREADY OUT FOR IA SO IF YOU GUYS LOVE IT AND PLAY IT A TON THEN YOU HAVE PLENTY OF OPTIONS TO GO WITH FROM THERE
I REALLY LIKE BOTH BUT THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT I THINK YOU'LL GET MORE VARIABILITY OUT OF IMPERIAL ASSAULT SINCE IT HAS TWO DISTINCT MODES OF PLAY EACH OF WHICH HAS A LOT OF VARIETY YOU ARE LIKELY GOING TO END UP SPENDING MORE ON IT LONG TERM HOWEVER SINCE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT TO GET AT LEAST SOME OF THE EXPANSIONS

REBELLION IS ALSO A GREAT GAME AND THERE'S CERTAINLY ROOM IN A COLLECTION FOR BOTH OTHER THAN THE IP THE TWO HAVE ALMOST NOTHING IN COMMON EXCEPT THAT EACH HAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF GRAY MOLDED PLASTIC IN IT UNTIL AND UNLESS WE GET AN EXPANSION FOR IT THOUGH IT DOESN'T OFFER ANYWHERE NEAR THE VARIATION THAT IA DOES

IF YOU ONLY WANT TO GET ONE IT PROBABLY COMES DOWN TO WHICH SORT OF GAME YOU AND YOUR PLAY PARTNER PREFER TACTICAL MINIATURES COMBAT IA OR A MORE STRATEGIC STYLE REBELLION AND HOW MUCH VARIETY YOU WANT IA GETS THE NOD HERE
I HAVE BOTH AND LOVE BOTH

I LIKE IMPERIAL ASSAULT MORE AS A WHOLE BUT GETTING IT TO THE TABLE IS MUCH HARDER THEN REBELLION

IF I WERE TO COMPARE JUST THE OPTIONS REBELLION IS A BETTER GAME IMO

IMPERIAL ASSAULT RELIES HEAVILY ON HAVING A SET GROUP YOU CAN GET TO THE TABLE CONSISTENTLY

REBELLION ONLY REQUIRES ANOTHER PERSON TO PLAY WITH

I HAVE PLAYED MANY MORE GAMES OF REBELLION THAN IA JUST BECAUSE ITS EASIER TO GET SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH
MAKES ME WANT TO VIDEO RECORD ALL MY UNBOXING FROM NOW ON
NO NEVER HAD THAT HAPPEN IT IS DEFINITELY ODD ARE THERE ANY WEIGHT STATEMENTS ON THE TRACKING

I'VE HAD MISSING PARTS OF MY PLEDGE BUT THE COMPANY HAS USUALLY RESPONDED AND BEEN ABLE TO SEND THEM
THAT'S MESSED UP MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT PICTURES DOES THE BOX LOOK LIKE IT WAS TAMPERED WITH
BIG QUESTION DOES THE SHIPPING LABEL HAVE THE WEIGHT ON IT
WELL THIS OPINION APPEARS THAT IT WILL GO AGAINST THE GRAIN BUT I ENJOY PLAYING WITH MY BROTHERS WHEN I SEE THEM AROUND THE HOLIDAYS T DAYS
I KNOW THE GAME HAS BALANCE PROBLEMS AND I KNOW IT'S CHIC TO PICK ON IT EVEN BEYOND WHAT IT'S AFFORDED BY THOSE PROBLEMS BUT TO ME IT'S JUST FUN TO PLAY AND IT'S EASY ENOUGH TEACH THAT I CAN PLAY IT WITH NEWER GAMERS THAT LIKELY WON'T EVEN NOTICE THE BALANCE ISSUES
WE PLAYED THE CRAP OUT OF THIS GAME GOT ALL THE EXPANSIONS HAD A BLAST

THE WHOLE ATTACK EACH OTHER TO DEATH CAN STRAIN THE DYNAMICS OF A GAME GROUP THOUGH SO NOW IT DOESN'T COME OUT AS OFTEN AS IT USED TO
DDK WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS GAME BUT IN CONCEPT IS SOUNDS FUN BUT WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY PLAYING IT IT'S SO BORING AND THEN IT JUST AORTA ENDS THIS IS THE ONLY GAME IN MY COLLECTION I WON'T PLAY AND NO ONE WANTS IT SO I CAN'T GET RID OF IT EVEN WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT I DIDN'T EVEN ENJOY IT EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMED FUN FROM EVERYTHING I SAW QUITE HONESTLY THIS GAMES DISAPPOINTMENT HAS AFFECTED MY OPINION OF MANY DOW GAMES
ONE OF THE FIRST GAMES I PLAYED THAT GOT ME BACK INTO BOARD GAMING A SIMPLE ENOUGH GAME SO MAY APPEAL TO THOSE WHO DON'T PLAY MANY GAMES BUT LIKE A BIT OF BASIC STRATEGY TOO AT LEAST THAT WAS ME BACK THEN I HAVE SINCE MOVED ON TO OTHER GAMES BUT STILL ENJOY IT DIGITAL VERSION ONCE IN A WHILE

I HAVEN'T REALLY PLAYED THE EXPANSIONS MUCH BUT WHAT I FELT FROM THAT LIMITED EXPOSURE WAS THAT IT SIMPLY SHIFTED SOME BALANCE PROBLEMS TO NEW AREAS RATHER THAN MADE THE BALANCE BETTER OVERALL THE DYNAMICS WERE FUN ENOUGH BUT DIDN'T IMPROVE THE GAME ENORMOUSLY IMO
THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST BOARD GAMES MY BOYFRIEND AND I BOUGHT WHEN WE STARTED COLLECTING PLAYED IT AT PAX AND ENJOYED IT ORDERED IT OFF AMAZON BEFORE WE GOT HOME
GOT IT LAST YEAR FOR CHRISTMAS I STILL ENJOY IT
I FEEL LIKE THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED SMALL WORLD I HAD A LOT OF FUN AND FELT THAT IT WAS A GREAT GAME EVERY PLAY AFTER THAT AND THERE WEREN'T MANY WAS AWFUL THOUGH I SOLD MY COPY YEARS AGO
I EXCITEDLY BOUGHT THIS GAME YEARS AGO I HAD PLAYED VINCI AT A GAME MEET UP AND ENJOYED IT BUT IT WAS OUT OF PRINTING FOUND OUT THAT SMALL WORLD WAS THE SAME BASIC GAME AND SNAPPED IT UP SMALL WORLD HAS SOME CHANGES SOME ARE IMPROVEMENTS SOME ARE ARGUABLE THAT MAKE THE GAME DISTINCT YOU NOW HAVE TWO STACK OF POWERS RACE POWER VS JUST ONE SET OF TILES THAT CAN BE COMBINED HOWEVER THEY FALL USES COINS FOR POINTS INSTEAD OF A SCORING TRACK PLAYS FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF TURNS INSTEAD OF ENDING WHEN SOMEONE REACHES A POINT THRESHOLD THERE'S NOW A DIE YOU CAN ROLL AND HAS A FANTASY THEME RATHER THAN A POST ROME EUROPE THEME IT'S THIS LAST CHANGE THAT I THINK HAS MADE THE GAME MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL WITH BROAD APPEAL ALSO NOW THEY CAN RELEASE NEW SETS OF RACES POWERS AS EXPANSIONS EASILY

IT WAS A GOOD GAME THAT I ENJOYED BUT I HAVEN'T REACHED FOR IT IN YEARS THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH BALANCE THAT I CAN'T REALLY FORGIVE I FIND THE WELL YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PICK ON THE LEADER STRATEGY AS A REBUFF TO THIS KINDA A COP OUT ESPECIALLY IN A GAME WITH HIDDEN VICTORY POINTS ALSO WHENEVER THIS STRATEGY IS EMPLOYED SOMEONE WILL WALK AWAY FEELING LIKE THEY WERE PICKED ON ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT OTHER PLAYER WAS GETTING JUST AS MANY POINTS AS THEY WERE

IT'S A LIGHT EURO GAME THAT I FEEL LIKE I'VE MOVED PASSED AND DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING THAT CALLS ME BACK TO IT
ONE OF THE RARE DAYS OF WONDER GAMES THAT DID NOT AGE WELL

IT WAS VERY UNIQUE WHEN IT CAME OUT IT BLENDED AREA CONTROL AND EURO MECHANICS INTO NEW EASILY DIGESTIBLE GAME IT IS EVEN CONSIDERED SOMEWHAT OF A GATEWAY GAME THE PROBLEM IS WHO IS IT A GATEWAY GAME FOR IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD AS A GAME IT'S NOT A VERY SATISFYING EURO AND THE BALANCE IS REALLY WHACK

AFTER A FEW PLAYS THERE ISN'T MUCH TO BE HAD
I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS GAME WHEN I FIRST PLAYED IT I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT IN YEARS MAYBE I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOT
SMALL WORLD UNDERGROUND EDITION WAS MY GATEWAY INTO GAMES AND STILL PLAY IT FROM TIME TO TIME IT MAY NOT BE THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME BUT IS GREAT FUN FOR A CASUAL GAMER
I HATE THIS GAME I FIND IT TAKES FOREVER WHEN PEOPLE ARE DECIDING ON NEW CHARACTERS TO BE THE TURNS AREN'T EXCITING AND GOING INTO DECLINE HAPPENS WAY TOO OFTEN THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY GAMES MAYBE THE ONLY GAME I WILL OUTRIGHT REFUSE TO PLAY
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHTS TO MAKE BLIZZARD BOARD GAMES ANYMORE SO IT'S GONE I HAVE A COPY I PLAYED IT ONCE WAS NOT IMPRESSED
LICENSES ARE GENERALLY DEALS THAT RUN FOR A FEW YEARS FFA HAD THE WARCRAFT LICENSE FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEN THE DEAL RAN OUT WITHOUT SPENDING MONEY TO RENEW THE LICENSE THEY CANNOT PRODUCE WARCRAFT PRODUCTS ANY LONGER

BEST CHANCE IS TO GET IT SECONDHAND SOMEHOW
LIKE U LEVIATHAN SAID HE PERFECTLY DESCRIBED THAT STUFF IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH FFA AND GW RIGHT NOW SOON FURY OF DRACULA AND TITLES LIKE FORBIDDEN STARS WILL SOON JUST VANISH FROM THE WEBSITE
I PERSONALLY LIKE BATTLETOWN MUCH MORE BUT THE PROBLEM WITH BATTLETOWN IS THAT THE GAME IS EXTREMELY DULL FOR THE PURPOSES OF A CASUAL GAME NIGHT JUST LIKE AN ACTUAL FIGHTING GAME A GAME COULD GET FAIRLY BORING IF AN EXPERIENCED PLAYER IS DESTROYING SOMEONE NEW AND IT ALSO COULD BE FAIRLY BORING IF BOTH PLAYERS ARE NOT EXPERIENCED AND PROCEED TO JUST BUTTON MASH WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY DOING NOW BATTLETOWN IS DEFINITELY IMO THE SUPERIOR GAME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DEEP HIGHLY REPAYABLE EXPERIENCE BUT LIKE FIGHTING GAMES IT REQUIRES PEOPLE TO PLAY IT ALOT TO ACTUALLY GET TO THAT LEVEL OF ENJOYMENT

SO FOR YOUR SITUATION IF YOU ARE INDEED GOING TO BE PLAYING CASUALLY I EAST ONCE A MONTH OR SO THEN I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ASHES FOR THAT SITUATION AND THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO REALLY LOVES BATTLETOWN
IF I MAY POINT YOU TO EXCEED RED HORIZON BY LEVEL GAMES THE SAME DEVELOPER OF BATTLETOWN I'D LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS A MORE CASUAL VERSION OF BATTLETOWN AND MOST REVIEWERS SAY THE SAME THING AS WELL IT HAS A SPRINKLE OF LUCK AS OPPOSED TO BC WHICH EVENS OUT THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN BEGINNER AND EXPERTS AND IT'S GAMEPLAY IS EASIER TO PICK UP BY CASUAL GAMERS AS WELL I'VE HAD A TON OF LUCK INTRODUCING THIS GAME TO ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE JUST YESTERDAY ME AND MY COUSIN HAD A LOT OF FUN PLAYING IT HE'S DEFINITELY A BOARDGAME CASUAL

ASHES IS REALLY A PROMISING GAME BUT THE DECK CUSTOMIZATION ASPECT OF IT PREVENTS IT FROM BEING A CASUAL GAME ATLEAST IN MY OPINION SURE YOU CAN JUST PLAY THE PREGUILT DECKS BUT YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON EXPERIENCING EVERYTHING THE GAME HAS TO OFFER FINALLY THE EXPANSION PROBLEMS IS THE FINAL NAIL THAT PREVENTED ME FROM BUYING INTO THE GAME
CHECK OUT THE ONLINE WEBSITE FOR BATTLETOWN YOU'LL NEED TO REGISTER AN ACCOUNT BUT YOU CAN GRAB FREEBIE PAPS FOR CHARACTERS 2 FROM WAR INDENES 2 FROM DEV INDENES PRINT THEM OUT TRY THEM OUT AND SEE FROM THERE RULEBOOK AND TUTORIAL ALSO AVAILABLE ON THAT SITE

BEST WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE IF IT'S SOMETHING FOR YOU OR NOT
CODEX EVEN THOUGH IT HAS DECK BUILDING COMPARED TO ASHES WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO DECKS MAY BE VERY MUCH UP YOUR ALLEY

BETWEEN BATTLETOWN AND ASHES I'D DEFINITELY SAY GO W BATTLETOWN THERE'S BEEN SOME ISSUES W GETTING EXPANSIONS TO ASHES AND WITH THE AMOUNT OF CONTENT RIDICULOUS AMOUNT WITHIN BATTLETOWN THERE'S PLENTY TO KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED FOR AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME

CHECK OUT THIS PICTURE THE GOLD LEAVES ON EACH CARD REPRESENT HOW MANY OF EACH CARD ARE IN THE GAME
THE ORIGINAL CARDS HAVEN'T CHANGED

A FEW GAMES THAT MY WIFE AND I PLAY THAT CHECK SOME OR ALL OF YOUR BOXES LE HAVRE AGRICOLA ROBINSON CRUSOE NATIONS TERRA MYSTIC AND VITICULTURE ESSENTIAL EDITION
VITICULTURE SOUNDS RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY CAVERN AGRICOLA EUPHORIA AH SO MANY
LEWIS CLARK
ROKOKO
COAL BARON
VILLAGE VILLAGE INN EXP
SNOWDONIA
BRUXELLES
KANKAN
AND SO MANY MORE


VITICULTURE IS MY FAVORITE I ALSO LIKE AGRICOLA AND NEW BEDFORD THOUGH THE LATTER DOESN'T HAVE CARDS I DIDN'T REALLY LOVE WATERDEEP NOTHING WRONG WITH THE MECHANICS JUST I GUESS WHEN I SEE THE D D LABEL I EXPECT A BIT OF D D IN THE GAME
I'D LOOK INTO CONCORDIA AND MAYBE DEUS ALTHOUGH NEITHER IS A WORKER PLACEMENT
YEDO IS A GREAT NEXT STEP FROM WATERDEEP INCLUDES WORKER PLACEMENT CARD DECKS AND RESOURCE GATHERING YOU FULFILL QUEST CARDS LIKE WATERDEEP BUT YOU HAVE A PERSONAL TABLEAU OF MOSTLY PERMANENT UPGRADES YOU BUILD UP
VITICULTURE IS REALLY GOOD
I REALLY LIKE THE MANHATTAN PROJECT HERE IS HOW IT PLAYS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY

YOU CAN'T USE OTHER PLAYER'S BUILDINGS UNLESS YOU GO ON THE ESPIONAGE SPOT

RAPID PLACEMENT ON YOUR OWN BUILDINGS GIVES AN ENGINE BUILDING FEEL

YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHEN TO RECALL YOUR AGENTS

YOU CAN BOMB OTHER PLAYER'S BUILDINGS SO THEY CAN'T BE USED UNTIL REPAIRED


MY FAVORITE GAME IS ALCHEMISTS WHICH IS ALSO WORKER PLACEMENT BUT IT'S QUITE A STEP UP FROM LORDS OF WATERDEEP IF YOU LIKE LOGIC PUZZLES IT COULD BE SOMETHING TO CHECK OUT
YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT CHAMPIONS OF MIDGARD IT'S QUITE SIMILAR TO LOW BUT ADDS THE TWIST OF COMBAT TO FINISH QUESTS AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY GATHERING THE NEEDED RESOURCES
THE VOYAGE OF MARCO POLO USES DICE AS WORKERS BUT OTHER THAN THAT IN MY OPINION IS QUITE SIMILAR WITH LOW IT COLLECT CAMELS GOLD SILK AND PEPPERS IT HAS CONTRACTS LIKE QUESTS IN LOW MORE ACTION PLACE IN CITY CARDS LIKE BUILDINGS IN LOW VARIABLE CHARACTER POWERS MORE EXCITING THAN LOW IT DOES NOT HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF INTRIGUE CARDS THOUGH

ARGENT THE CONSORTIUM IS WHAT I CONSIDER AS LOW IN STEROIDS IT HAS LOTS OF RESOURCES MANA COINS WISDOM INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH IT HAS WORKERS WHICH HAVE SPECIAL POWERS RED WORKER CAN ATTACK ANOTHER WORKER GREEN IMMUNE TO ATTACK BLUE IMMUNE TO SPELL ETC IT HAS VARIABLE CHARACTER POWER IT HAS SPELLS WHICH CAN REALLY MESS UP YOUR ENEMY NOT ONLY MORE MAGICAL THAN LOW ARGENT ALSO BRINGS PLAYER INTERACTION UP TO ELEVEN
AREN'T THOSE THE SHAPES FROM QWIRKLE
NO BUT THIS SITE MIGHT HELP DICE COLLECTOR
LOOKS LIKE A TODDLER GAME MAYBE

IT'S BUGGING ME BECAUSE I'M CONFIDENT I'VE SEEN THAT SAME DIE BEFORE BUT IT'S NOT COMING BACK TO ME
LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THE DICE IN SUBDIVISION
THIS WAS THE CLOSEST THING I COULD FIND ONLINE I'M GUESSING THAT IT WAS PART OF AN EDUCATIONAL SHAPE DRAWING GAME GOOD LUCK

DICE
JUST HAD TO GET REPLACEMENT PARTS FROM STONEMEIER AND THEY WERE GREAT JUST GO THROUGH THEIR WEBSITE ON MOBILE RIGHT NOW SO I CAN'T LINK BUT IF YOU SEARCH IT SHOULD COME UP
WELL THAT SUCKS ESPECIALLY SINCE I ALSO ORDERED IT FROM MM AND IT'S SUPPOSED TO GET HERE IN A WEEK ONE SIDE OF THE BOARD IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN GERMAN SINCE THEY DID A SHARED PRINT RUN FOR IT BUT I'M PRETTY SURE EVERYTHING ELSE SHOULD BE IN ENGLISH I'VE HEARD THAT STONEMAIER IS GOOD AT REPLACING THINGS SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE ENGLISH COMPONENTS HERE
JUST CONTACT STONEMEIER AND THEY'LL SHIP YOU OUT THE CORRECT CARDS
I OWN THE GERMAN VERSION OF THE GAME AND IT HAS A DOUBLE SIDED BOARD WITH GERMAN ON ONE SIDE AND ENGLISH ON THE OTHER MAYBE THEY GOT MIXED UP DO YOU KNOW WHICH LANGUAGE THE OTHER SIDE IS
ONLY ONE I HAVE IS THE CHRISTMAS VERSION OF LOVE LETTER
ONLY ONE I'VE HEARD OF IS THE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS CARD GAME I THINK ITS IN A TABLETOP EPISODE IT'S ON AMAZON ALSO NOTICED THERE'S HOLIDAY FLUX TOO
YOU COULD DO YOUR OWN VERSION OF CODE NAMES WITH CHRISTMAS WORDS JUST CUT UP SOME PAPER AND PUT XMAS WORDS ON THEM AND MAYBE PRINT OUT A COUPLE OF REINDEER FOR ONE TEAM AND ELVES FOR THE OTHER TEAM AND EACH TEAM IS TRYING TO COLLECT XMAS ITEMS BY COVERING THEM WITH THERE CARDS HAVE THE BOMB CARD BE THE GRINCH OR SOMETHING
MAYBE MAKE YOUR OWN VERSION OF AVALON OR SECRET HITLER WITH A CHRISTMAS THEME LIKE INSTEAD OF MERLIN YOU COULD HAVE SANTA AND INSTEAD OF PERCY YOU COULD HAVE CINDY LOU WHO MORGANA WOULD BE THE GRINCH NO IDEA WHO THE ASSASSIN MORDRED WOULD BE WITH THAT THEME THOUGH I JUST LIKE THE IDEA OF CINDY LOU WHO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S THE GRINCH AND WHO'S SANTA
MY BEST RECOMMENDATION IS TELESTRATIONS PARTY PACK BUT REMOVE THE CARDS IN THE GAME YOU USE TO DRAW AND WRITE YOUR OWN ADULT CHRISTMAS THEMED ONES INSTEAD THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING AT MY PARTY THIS YEAR WE DID IT FOR HALLOWEEN A YEAR AGO AND IT WAS HILARIOUS

ALTERNATIVELY UNEMPLOYED HAS A HOLIDAY EXPANSION BUT IT INCLUDES ALL MAJOR HOLIDAYS
I GUESS YOU COULD DO A CREATE YOUR OWN CARD VARIANT ON POPULAR GAMES LIKE SAY ANYTHING THAT COME WITH CATEGORIES AND REPLACE TYPICAL CARDS WITH HOLIDAY THEMED DECK INSTEAD OF YOU HAS TIME

OTHERWISE CRAPPY BIRTHDAY COULD BE CALLED CRAPPY CHRISTMAS AND KEPT THE SAME IN THEME
WHEN YOU SAY ADULT GAMES DO YOU MEAN NAUGHTY LIKE A GAME THAT IS BOTH CHRISTMAS THEMED AND OF THE AFTER DARK VARIETY
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TRY A PARTY GAME AND BUY GIFTS YOU COULD GO DUTCH
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY AND I ASSUME RACE AS WELL AND TERRAFORMING MARS ARE THE 2 THAT I OWN BOTH GOOD GAMES
LOVE TABLEAU BUILDING GAMES HERE ARE SOME FAVORITES

STATE MASTER SET

SAINT PETERSBURG

ORA ET LABARA

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY

THROUGH THE AGES A NEW STORY OF CIVILIZATION

BRUGES

SAN JUAN PUERTO RICO

TOURNAY

PORT ROYAL
RACE FOR THE GALAXY IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FOLLOWED BY SAN JUAN THEIR ANCESTOR PUERTO RICO IS ON MY SHELF BUT I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY IT YET
VICEROY
ON THE HEAVIER SIDE PAX PAMIR AND PAX RENAISSANCE
DEUS WASN'T MENTIONED YET AND THAT IS THE KING OF TABLEAU BUILDING IN MY EYES IT DOES GET A BIT TIGHT ON SPACE AND AGGRESSIVE ON TAKING POINTS ON THE MAP AWAY

AND EVEN TERRAFORMING MARS MAY HIT THAT SPOT IT MAY BE MORE ENGINE BUILDER THOUGH IT DOES HAVE SOME INTERACTION BUT NOTHING I WOULD RATE ABOVE LIGHT AGGRESSION THAT ONLY HAPPENS A FEW TIMES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY MIGHT BE MY FAVOURITE GAME THE MECHANICS ARE SO TIGHT IN THIS GAME

ARCANE ACADEMY PICKED THIS UP RECENTLY AND ENJOY THE TABLEAU PART OF THE GAME IT'S PRETTY LIGHT COMPARED TO MOST OTHER TABLEAU GAMES I LIKE THE CHAINING OF POWERS THAT YOU CAN BUILDING IT DOES HAVE A BIT OF PLAYER INTERACTION THOUGH

PRINCES OF FLORENCE BUILDING AN ESTATE TO ENCOURAGE SCHOLARS AND ARTISTS TO CREATE GREAT WORKS GREAT AUCTION SYSTEM WITH INTERESTING CHOICES

PATCHWORK TWO PLAYER BUILDING A QUILT WITH TERRIS INSPIRED PIECES SUCH A SIMPLE MECHANICS FOR A GREAT GAME

COTTAGE GARDEN I HAVE THIS ON ORDER SIMILAR GAME AS PATCHWORK

HAVEN'T PLAYED IT BUT LUNARCHITECTS LOOKS INTERESTING IT'S BASED ON THE HIGHLY RATED GLEN MORE
JUST PLAYED ISLE OF SKYE FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY ITS LIKE CARCASSONNE EXCEPT EVERYONE BUILDS INDIVIDUALLY DEFINITELY SOME OTHER ECONOMIC INTERACTIONS THOUGH
DEUS
SUBURBIA

CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG ARE SOME OTHERS REALLY DEPENDS UPON YOUR DEFINITION OF TABLEAU BUILDING I SUPPOSE SOME SAY CARDS OTHERS INCLUDING ME SAY WHATEVER STUFF YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU THAT YOU'VE BUILT UP

FUN GAMES LA GANJA NO SIESTA LOOKS INTERESTING AS WELL

OTHER RECOMMENDS WITHIN RESPONSES ARE FABLE I'LL SECOND PAX PORFIRIANA PAX WHATEVER NOWADAYS INNOVATION ST PETE LOVE THIS GAME LATELY


JUST SO HAPPY TO SEE SOMEONE WITH SIMILAR TASTES

MANY TILE LAYING GAMES WILL FIT THIS BILL BUT OFTEN AS YOU NOTED WITH QUADROPOLIS THEY MIGHT LACK AN ENGINE BUILDING ASPECT SOME GOOD GAMES TO START WITH MIGHT BE

ELYSIUM THIS ONE IS SO GOOD PLAYER INTERACTION IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED TO SOME RATHER TIGHT DRAFTING THE TENSION IN THE GAME IS ALL ABOUT KEEPING CARDS IN ORDER TO USE THEIR POWERS OR BANKING THEM FOR POINTS AND LOSING THEIR POWER IT'S VERY SATISFYING

AUTOMANIA PLAYER INTERACTION VIA WORKER PLACEMENT AND TILE DRAFTING BUT ASIDE FROM THAT IT'S MOSTLY JUST A RACE TO SEE WHO CAN CHURN OUT THE BEST CARS THIS IS A NEW FAVORITE

PUERTO RICO

SAN JUAN

RACE FOR THE GALAXY SAN JUAN ON CRACK

YOU MIGHT ALSO CHECK OUT GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL WHICH IS A FANTASTIC COMBINATION OF TILE LAYING ACTION SELECTION AND DRAFTING I'M NOT SURE IT MEETS YOUR CRITERIA EXACTLY BUT YOU ESSENTIALLY DESCRIBED MY FAVORITE TYPE OF GAME BUILDING WITH MINIMAL INTERACTION AND THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE GAMES SO CHECK IT OUT

RACE FOR TR GALAXY IS VERY DEEP AND REWARDING ROLL FOR THE GALAXY IS MORE INTERESTING TO NON GAMERS
IMPERIAL SETTLERS GETS PLAY EVERY WEEK AT MY HOUSE
IF THE MINIMAL INTERACTION INCLUDES DRAFTING THEN

AMONG THE STARS YOU ARE BUILDING A SPACE STATION

GLENMORE SCOTTISH VILLAGE

IF YOU DON'T MIND A HEAVY GAME

INNOVATION
WHAT ABOUT SAN JUAN
THIS MAY BE A LITTLE BUT CONSIDER TALISMAN IT HAS THE SAME MOVE AROUND THE BOARD ENCOUNTER THINGS INTERACTION ALONG WITH A JOURNEY OF GAINING POWER SO YOU CAN CONQUER THE CENTER OF THE BOARD


AS FAR AS PLAYING WITH KIDS GO THERE IS VERY LITTLE HIDDEN KNOWLEDGE IN THE GAME NONE IF YOU THAT SPELLS ARE NOT HIDDEN THIS MEANS THAT ADULTS CAN HELP KIDS PLAY THEIR TURN EASILY I HAVE A FRIEND THAT PLAYS WITH HIS KIDS AND THEY HAVE A BLAST
GRIMSLINGERS ISN'T TECHNICALLY DARK TOWER BUT IT HAS A LOT OF SIMILARITIES TO THE UNIVERSE GREAT ART SIMPLE GAME MIGHT BE AS CLOSE AS YOU'LL GET
BURGLE BROS AND PANDEMIC ARE BY FAR MY TWO FAVORITE COOPERATIVE GAMES BUT FOR PANDEMIC LEGACY BURGLE BROS WOULD BY FAR BE MY
MACHS VS MINIONS PLAYERS CONTROL MACHS TO COMPLETE VARIOUS MISSION OBJECTIVES THERE ARE MISSIONS YOU DRAFT A COMMAND CARD EACH TURN PUT THEM IN YOUR PROGRAMMING BOARD AND EXECUTE THEM ATTACK OR STOMP THOSE PESKY MINIONS BEFORE THEY DAMAGE YOUR MACHS DAMAGED MECH STAYS IN THE GAME BUT DRAW A DAMAGE CARD WHICH MESSES UP YOUR PROGRAMMING VERY FUN
FLASH POINT RESCUE PEOPLE AND CAT AND DOG FROM BURNING HOUSE TOGETHER

SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE GREAT TO NUT OUT SOLUTIONS AS A TEAM

IF YOU LIKE A DARKER HOVERCRAFT THEME THE NEWLY RELEASED MARKHAM HORROR CARD GAME IS FABULOUS ALSO MARKHAM HORROR AND ELDRITCH HORROR ARE BRUTAL BUT GREAT TO PLAY

HANAFI IS A LOT OF FUN
GHOST STORIES IS A REALLY TOUGH GAME ABOUT KUNG-FU MOVIE HEROES BUSTING GHOSTS
A LOT HAS BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY BUT IF YOU LIKED PANDEMIC YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES THE GAMEPLAY IS A BIT LIKE A MIX OF PANDEMIC AND FLASH POINT FIRE RESCUE WITH A PIRATE THEME

MORE GAMES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN MENTIONED SO FAR THAT MIGHT STRIKE YOUR FANCY

THE BIG BOOK OF MADNESS

LEGENDS OF ANDOR


I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE STRONG OPINIONS AGAINST IT BUT I REALLY ENJOY ELDER SIGN
FORBIDDEN ISLAND AND SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT ARE TWO CO-OP GAMES THAT GET A LOT OF PLAY AT MY HOUSE
LET'S SEE

FORBIDDEN DESERT VERY PANDEMIC ESQ

AEONS END COOP DECKBUILDER

LEGENDARY GAMES COOP DECK BUILDER

SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE VERY FIDDLY IMO

SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT BATTLESTEAD GALACTICA TRAITOR MECHANICS

FLASH POINT ALSO VERY PANDEMIC ESQ

ROBINSON CRUSOE VERY FUN BUT VERY CHALLENGING

MANSIONS OF MADNESS HORROR COOP STORY DRIVEN






MYSTERIUM BEYOND BAKER STREET SAMURAI SPIRIT
BLACK ORCHESTRA A GAME ABOUT GERMAN CONSPIRATORS TRYING TO TAKE OUT HITLER WHILE NOT GETTING CAUGHT BY GESTAPO
TENSE I MASCULINE EAST STORIES IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE MY FAVORITE CO-OP GAME
FORBIDDEN DESERT AND ISLAND ARE NICE VERY SIMPLE AND CLEAN THEME MORE LIKELY TO WIN THESE THAN MOST COOP

GHOST STORIES IS MY PERSONAL FAVORITE BUT DON'T EXPECT TO WIN VERY MUCH IT'S JUST REALLY FUN TO PLAY ANYWAY

ZOMBICIDE IS NICE IF YOU LIKE THE THEME OF DEAD OF WINTER BUT NOT THE BETRAYAL SECRET GOALS OR MECHANICS IF YOU DO LIKE THE BETRAYAL GO FOR BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON HILL

SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT IS REALLY FUN IF THERE'S A SECRET BETRAYER BUT KIND OF BORING WITHOUT SO THAT'S AN OPTION IF YOU LIKE THE KING ARTHUR THEME
IF YOU LIKE PANDEMIC STYLE THEMING THEN YOU MIGHT LIKE BCOM IT'S TECH THEMED AND SAVE THE WORLD EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT ROLES BUT ALL WORK TOGETHER
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES
THERE ARE A TON OF GOOD SUGGESTIONS IN THIS THREAD SO I'M GOING TO GO WITH SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE HAS MENTIONED AND SAY THAT YOU SHOULD GET SPACE ALERT REAL-TIME COOPERATIVE GAME ABOUT SURVIVING IN SPACE GREAT STUFF
HAVE A LOOK AT THE GRIZZLED
SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE
IF YOUR FAMILY LIKED SCRABBLE THEN PAPERBACK IS A FUN DECK BUILDING GAME WITH A GOOD CO-OP MODE
LIKE THIS
I DON'T OWN THE GAME I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT IT IS VERY GRAND OF YOU
CUT THE BOARD ALONG EACH SEAM SHADOW MOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES PUT EACH PLAYER'S CHARACTER CARD AND PAWN IN THE DISPLAY WITH A MIX OF OTHER CARDS AND GIVE THEM OUT TO EACH PLAYER
SOMEONE POSTED THIS A WHILE AGO FOR RISK LEGACY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY NEAT THE GUY WHO DID IT SAID HE WAS ALSO PLANNING TO FRAME THE BOARD TO GO ALONG WITH THE SHADOW BOX POTENTIAL RISK LEGACY SPOILERS IN THERE BUT YOU HAVE TO ZOOM IN TO GET ANY REAL DETAILS THOUGH BE WARNED ONE OF THE EXTRA FACTIONS IS VERY CLEARLY VISIBLE
BURN IT IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO BE SURE OF ERADICATING ALL OF THE DISEASES
SOME FRIENDS HAVE MOUNTED IT ON THEIR WALL WITH VARIOUS MEANS
ONE FRIEND OF MINE GOT A HUGE FRAME AND FRAMED THE BOARD CARDS ETC AND HUNG IT ON THE WALL SHADOW BOX STYLE IT LOOKS GREAT
I BELIEVE IT WAS RADIO WHO MENTIONED YOU CAN STILL USE THE BOARD TO PLAY YOUR OWN CUSTOM VERSION OF REGULAR PANDEMIC I HAVEN'T TRIED IT MYSELF BUT YOU COULD GET SOME MILEAGE OUT OF THAT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK BACK FONDLY AT THE LEGACY CAMPAIGN YOU WENT THROUGH
I DON'T SEE WHY YOU CAN'T JUST USE IT TO PLAY REGULAR PANDEMIC I'VE DONE THAT A FEW TIMES JUST IGNORE THE STICKERS AND OTHER LEGACY STUFF YOU COULD EVEN TREAT EACH MONTH'S RULES AS AN EXPANSION OR SORTS AND REPLAY THAT ONE
YOU COULD RESET THE BOARD TO THE START AND USE IT TO PLAY REGULAR PANDEMIC IF YOU LOOK UP HOW VARIOUS PANDEMIC EXPANSIONS WORK YOU COULD PROBABLY USE MOST OF THE LEGACY COMPONENTS AS EXPANSION BITS I HAVEN'T DONE IT WITH MY COPY BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY A BIG FAN OF REGULAR PANDEMIC AND NEITHER IS MY FIANCE SO I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND TO IT
IS IT POSSIBLE TO RESELL SORRY IF THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT YET
I LOVE LANTERNS IT'S A SIMPLE TO LEARN GAME THAT IS VERY FUN
I GUESS YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH SOME FAMILY CLASSICS LIKE SPLENDOR TAKENOKO MYSTERIUM KING OF TOKYO FORBIDDEN DESERT ISLAND I WOULD GO PROBABLY FOR SOMETHING COOPERATIVE AS IT IS MISSING IN THE LIST MAYBE EVEN TO PANDEMIC LEGACY IF SHE WOULD HAVE A GROUP AND IF SHE LIKES THE BASIC PANDEMIC
TAKENOKO IS A GOOD CALL WHAT IS THE SIZE OF HER NORMAL GAME GROUP CODENAMES IS A FUN PARTY GAME ALSO MAYBE GET LOVE LETTER TOO FOR HER STOCKING GOOD QUICK GAME AND CHEAP
TAKENOKO OR TAKAIDO ARE BOTH GOOD
TAKE A LOOK AT SPLENDOR SHAKESPEARE OR ROKOKO
CAMEL UP IS LIGHT AND SILLY FUN

LORDS OF WATERDEEP

BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL

BANG DICE SPECIFICALLY THE DICE GAME PLAIN BANG SUCKS

COUP
LANTERNS IS OKAY I WOULD CHECK OUT HOKKAIDO OR JAMAICA OR EVEN STONE AGE
PATCHWORK IF SHE PLAYS 2 PLAYER A LOT
LET'S SEE SUBURBIA OR CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG WOULD BE GREAT CHOICES
LANTERNS TAKENOKO AND MACHI LORI COULD BE NICE FOR HER

IF SHE LIKES TICKET TO RIDE AND CATAN THEN SHE MIGHT REALLY ENJOY ONE CALLED RUSSIAN RAILS WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS LIKE MIXING THOSE TWO TOGETHER YOU BUILD RAILWAYS BUT HAVE TO MANAGE WORKER PLACEMENT AND RESOURCES DESPITE NOT BEING A HUGE CATAN FAN I DO ENJOY THIS GAME
IT COULD BE THE MINI CHIMERA SLEEVES FROM
MAYDAY GAMES
CAN YOU ASK THE PERSON YOU BOUGHT IT FROM
MOST OF THE GAME STORE AROUND MY AREA SELL THE ULTIMATE GUARD PURPLES MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR
YOU SEE THE SAME SPIKES IN POPULARITY FOR A BUNCH OF GATEWAY BOARD GAMES

HERE'S TICKET TO RIDE

KING OF TOKYO

MARTIN BRASS

I THINK IT WOULD REPRESENT THE SEARCHES PERFORMED BY FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING TO BUY THESE GAMES AS CHRISTMAS GIFTS FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY AS WELL AS THE SEARCHES FROM FOLKS WHO JUST GOT COPIES AND WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM
OR PEOPLE SEARCHING ABOUT IT AFTER THEY GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAS

ALSO WHAT'S GOING ON IN ARGENTINA
GOOGLE TRENDS SHOWS WHAT PEOPLE SEARCH FOR SO I GUESS CHRISTMAS LISTS FILL UP WITH IT EACH YEAR
THE TOP OF EACH SPIKE SEEMS TO LINE UP WITH THE WEEK AFTER CHRISTMAS SO PRESUMABLY IT'S EITHER PEOPLE GOING WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GIFT I RECEIVED OR PEOPLE WHO GOT SUCKERED INTO PLAYING IT BY THE ONE GEEK MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AND THEN WENT WHERE THE HELL DO I BUY THAT GAME
GAMBLING AND LOW ANG

THOSE ARE CONTRADICTORY

I'M STILL GOING TO RECOMMEND LORDS OF VEGAS GAMBLING THEME APPEARS RANDOM BUT THE DRAWING FROM A DECK GUARANTEES A MOSTLY EVEN DISTRIBUTION

WITH EXPANSION
POWER GRID
OUT CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANY OF THOSE GAMES DEPENDING ON WHAT HE SHE LIKES YOU COULD ALSO CHECK OUT VITICULTURE OR LORDS OF THE WATER DEEP FOR A GOOD WORKER PLACEMENT

AS FOR DECK BUILDERS I WOULD PERSONALLY PASS ON DOMINION WHILE THERE IT IS KNOWN AS A STAPLE I PERSONALLY THINK THE ARE OTHER DECK BUILDERS CLANK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE ESPECIALLY SINCE IT HAS A PUSH YOUR LUCK GAMBLING ASPECT
THOSE ARE ALL QUITE ESPECIALLY FOND OF CARCASSONNE ANIS IS MY LATEST OBSESSION WHICH FITS MOST OF YOUR REQUIREMENTS PLAYERS COUNTY HR EASY TO LEARN BUT A TON OF NUANCE SOFT AREA CONTROL

EDIT DOMINION IS GREAT BUT I LIKE ARCTIC SCAVENGERS MUCH MORE AS A DERIVATIVE OF IT
TAKE A PEEK AT DIMMET QUITE SIMPLE BUT THERE IS A MAJOR SKILL CEILING

ANOTHER WORTH PEEKING AT WOULD BE CAN'T STOP EVEN THOUGH THAT STOPS AT PLAYERS IT'S A RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE CONCEPT BUT HAS A SUPER FUN ASPECT THAT COULD BE GREAT TO SCRATCH THE GAMBLING ITCH

NOW LET'S LOOK AT MY FAVORITE GAMBLING GAME ANDANTE LIGHT DARK THE 1ST EDITION WAS PRETTY MUDDY WITH RULES AND MADE FOR ME AND MY GROUP A RATHER UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE SILIN CAUGHT ONTO THAT SIMPLIFIED AND STREAMLINED AND MAN 2ND EDITION IS A HOOT BUT YOU REALLY DO NEED A VERY COMPETITIVE GROUP WHO IS INTO THE CONCEPT POKER W POWERS AT ITS MOST SIMPLIFIED


FOR MEGA HIGH SKILL CEILING AND PLAYERS ONLY IMO AND PREFERRED CHECK OUT FICHU SIMPLE CARD GAME THAT'S PLAYED IN TEAMS NASTY FUN

IT'S A STEP UP IN INITIAL COMPLEXITY BUT PERHAPS HAVE A PEEK AT DOMINANT SPECIES THAT IS A VICIOUS GAME TOO WAS A HIT WITH TEENAGE EARLY ADULTS I'VE PLAYED IT WITH
PERSONALLY I LIKE DOMINION ONLINE MUCH BETTER NO SET UP NO SHUFFLING NO COUNTING JUST PURE PLAYING
COSMIC ENCOUNTER SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT FOR HIM
ISLE OF SKYE AND ABYSS MIGHT APPEAL TO HIM
PANDEMIC AND CARCASSONNE ARE GOOD I REALLY ENJOY TICKET TO RIDE I PERSONALLY FIND DOMINION TO BE INCREDIBLY BORING
TICKET IS NICE LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IT SIMILAR THEME WITH MORE BRAIN POWER AND STRATEGY IS RUSSIAN RAIL I HIGHLY RECOMMEND RUSSIAN RAIL FOR STRATEGY

HE MAY ALSO ENJOY VITICULTURE BUT THAT ISN'T A SHORT GAME TO PLAY
VEGAS SHOWDOWN

NOT REALLY GAMBLING BUT BIDDING AND OUTBIDDING IS FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THIS ONE WHICH FEELS SIMILAR TO CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG WITH A VEGAS TWIST
TABLETOP SIMULATOR ON STEAM LOOKS LIKE IT'S AVAILABLE ON MAC AND PC
BOARDGAMEARENA WORKS FINE TABLETOPIA IS BETTER WITH A MOUSE THAN A TRACK PAD
I'LL SECOND BOARD GAME ARENA AND HAVE PLAYED MANY GAMES ON THERE AND HAVE EVEN BEEN A PAID MEMBER IN THE PAST

I ALSO ENJOY GOING TO SPECIFICALLY FOR CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AND AGRICOLA
YOU CAN PLAY BOARD GAMES ON WEBSITES LIKE OR THERE'S A LOT OF BOARD GAME WEBSITES THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH TOGETHER JUST GRAB A MUMBLE OR SKYPE OR WHATEVER AND CHAT AND PLAY YOU CAN ALSO USE VASSAL WHICH IS A JAVA BASED OPEN SOURCE BOARD GAME ENGINE THAT HAS A MAC PORTUGUESE
ADAMELLO
THE WAY AN ADVENTURE CAN COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU IN THE EVENT DECK FEELS SUPER THEMATIC A BEAST FOLLOWS YOU BACK TO CAMP AND LATER ATTACKS THE WOUND YOU SUFFERED EXPLORING GETS INFECTED YOU CONSTRUCTED YOUR SHELTER POORLY AND NOW IT COLLAPSES IT ALL FEELS REAL AND THE RANDOM NATURE OF WHEN MISTAKES COME BACK TO HAUNT YOU IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF THE GAME
I WOULD SAY A LOT OF THE STORY ELEMENTS ARE THEMATIC LIKE WHAT THE OTHER USER SAID ABOUT BEASTS FOLLOWING YOU BACK TO CAMP AND THE NUMEROUS VARIATIONS OF BAD WEATHER NEGATIVE EVENTS THAT SAID I DON'T THINK THE MECHANISMS ARE THE MOST THEMATIC IF I GO HUNT AND MY FRIEND GOES TO EXPLORE OR SOMEONE TO BUILD AND AN EVENT CAUSES MY ATTACK TO DROP I COULD LOSE THE HUNT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SUPPOSEDLY DOING SEPARATE ACTIONS IN THE SAME DAY I SUPPOSE ONE EXPLANATION IS HOW EVERYONE HAS TWO PAWNS WITH THEM REPRESENTING DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY BUT I THINK SOMETHING LIKE INDIVIDUAL ATTACK POWERS WOULD BE MORE THEMATIC BUT ALSO MORE CLUNKY

AFTER THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS WHICH AREN'T MECHANICALLY THEMATIC LIKE ROLLING DICE FOR RESOLUTIONS BUT THAT DEPENDS WHAT YOU THINK THE DICE REPRESENT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO ARCTIC SCAVENGERS MUSD HAVE A GREAT REVIEW OF IT
HAVE YOU SEEN THE KICKSTARTER FOR HERO REALMS IT'S A DECKBUILDING GAME WITH CCC CG MECHANICS IT'S BY THE CREATORS OF STAR REALMS AND EPIC INCIDENTALLY EPIC IS A FUN LITTLE MAGIC GAME WHICH IS SELF-CONTAINED IT'S NOT SYMMETRICAL THOUGH
IT IS BENEFICIAL TO PLAY THE KNIGHT BEFORE ROLLING FOR RESOURCES IN ORDER TO MOVE THE ROBBER OFF YOUR LAND

FOR OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT CARDS IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO HOLD ON TO THEM FOR EXAMPLE PLAYING THE MONOPOLY CARD WILL LIKELY NET MORE VALUE AFTER YOU ROLL FOR RESOURCES THAN BEFORE
THE ONLY ONE IT REALLY MAKES ANY SENSE FOR IS THE KNIGHT BUT YEAH YOU CAN PLAY IT BEFORE ROLLING
YES
THE REVISED EDITION WAS THE FIRST ONE WITH THE DESTROYERS AND ARTILLERY PIECES
AXIS AND ALLIES SECOND EDITION
SOME GOOD CHOICES
TRAJAN
SHAKESPEARE
THE VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO
VILLAGE VILLAGE INN EXP
CONCORDIA
DISCOVERIES
HOW ABOUT FIVE TRIBES NO LUCK BEAUTIFUL DESIGN WITH INTERESTING ONE OF A KIND MECHANISMS
HAVE YOU PLAYED ISTANBUL
CONCORDIA
BLOCKUS IS A CHEAP AND FUN TACTICAL GAME
AGRICOLA THE KING OF WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES
VITICULTURE
JUST CHECKING YOU ARE PLAYING THAT THEY REPLACE YOUR ENTIRE TURN RIGHT
WE'VE NOT FOUND THEM COMPLETELY OVERPOWERED AT ALL NUMBER

IF YOU USE A GUILD CARD YOU CAN PERFORM NO OTHER ACTION THAT TURN

ONE TURN TO RETRIEVE A GUILD CARD AND THEN ONE TURN TO ACTIVATE THE GUILD CARD I FIND TYPICALLY GUILD CARDS HAVE THE EQUIVALENT EFFECT OF ACTIONS BUT THEY PROVIDE YOU THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE IT WHEN FAR AWAY FROM USUAL TARGET TILE NOT AT ALL OP IN OUR EXPERIENCE
SOUNDS SIMILAR TO A GAME I PLAYED CALLED BULLSHIT BASICALLY YOU COULD CLAIM YOU HAD KINGS EVEN IF YOU ONLY HAD AND PLAY CARDS IF SOMEONE CALLED BULLSHIT ON YOU YOU HAD TO PROVE THEM RIGHT OR WRONG IF YOU WERE CAUGHT LYING YOU TOOK THE ENTIRE DISCARD PILE IF THE OTHER PLAYER WAS WRONG THEY TOOK IT INSTEAD

WE USED TO HAVE PEOPLE PLAY THEIR WHOLE HAND AS ONE STACK CALL WHATEVER AND THEN THE NEXT PLAYER WOULD THROW THEIR CARD DOWN BEFORE ANYONE COULD CALL BULLSHIT BUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE DEEMED FULL ON CHEATING CAUSED A LOT OF LAUGHTER THOUGH

WIKI CALLS IT CHEAT
WIKI CHEAT GAME
ITS VERY SIMILAR TO SHIT HEAD WITH A BIT OF BULLSHIT THROWN IN
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A VARIATION OF THE GAME I KNOW AS BIG TWO OR SCUM AND EMPEROR
IT SEEMS TO HAVE ELEMENTS SIMILAR TO BOTH CHEAT AND SHITHEAD SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD GAME I LIKE THE SCORING SYSTEM TOO
AND THEN THERE IS ANIS
IF YOU WANT TONS OF FIGHTING AND A COOL BATTLE SYSTEM WITH POWER UPS AND A SMALL ELEMENT OF BLUFFING A LA PRINCESS BRIDE BATTLE OF WITS THEN EMET IS THE WAY TO GO

IF YOU LOVE THE TENSION OF WATCHING EVERYONE'S ARMY SLOWLY BUILD UP ON A MAP UNTIL IT REACHES A POINT WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT OR EVEN BETTER EVERYONE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT EVERYONE IS TRYING TO STOP EACH OTHER FROM MAKING SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN GET CYCLADES
WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN THE DUDES ON A MAP GENRE WHAT ABOUT BLOOD RAGE DO YOU ENJOY
NEVER PLAYED BLOOD RAGE


PLAYED EMET ONCE LOVE THE POWER TILES ASPECT BUT DISLIKE THE TELEPORTATION CLUSTERFUCK COMBAT I ALREADY OWN NEXUS OPS AND WAS TRYING TO GET SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT



TRADED FOR CYCLADES ALONG WITH THE HADES EXPANSION AND I LOVE IT BASE GAME IS A TENSE AND SKILLFUL BIDDING GAME MORE THAN ANYTHING THOUGH YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE WHEN YOU CAN MAKE POWER PLAYS WITH ARES OR MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES HADES MODULES ENHANCE THE ABILITY TO MAKE UNEXPECTED OFFENSIVE PLAYS PLUS A NUMBER OF OTHER WELCOME CHANGES EAST G MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES CAN STICK AROUND LONGER AND WREAK HAVOC
EMET IS MY NUMBER GAME

CYCLADES HAS DICE IN THE COMBAT WHICH IS A FATAL FLAW

ANIS IS A BETTER BLOOD RAGE CARD DRAFTING AREA CONTROL

EMET STILL WINS OVER ANIS THANKS TO THE INCREDIBLE WEALTH OF STRATEGIES THANKS TO THE TECH TREES AND THE ACTION SELECTION PYRAMID MECHANIC BEING SO GOOD HINT SAVE MOVE ATTACK ACTIONS FOR THE END OF EACH ROUND THE COMPONENTS ARE GORGEOUS THE MAP IS VARIABLE FOR DIFFERENT PLAYER COUNTS AND THE EXPANSION OFFERS A TON OF NEW MODULES TO MIX IT UP IF IT STARTS GETTING STALE WHICH WILL TAKE A LONG TIME
WE HAVE ALL IN OUR GROUP AS MUCH AS I THINK THAT EMET IS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN CYCLADES ATLEAST WHEN COMPARING THE BASE GAMES CYCLADES WITH EXPANSIONS MIGHT BE BETTER I WOULD SAY TO GO WITH THE LATTER EMET HAS A LOT MORE SIMMILARIETIES TO BLOOD RAGE THAN CYCLADES GETTING CYCLADES WILL BRING SOMETHING FRESH TO THE TABLE THE AUCTION MECHANIC IS GREAT AND IT HAS A DIFFERENT THAN POINTS WIN CONDITION
CYCLADES STILL MY FAVOURITE COAM BUT I DO HAVE ALL THE EXPANSIONS
I OWN BLOOD RAGE EMET AND CYCLADES AND I PLAYED THEM ALL SEVERAL TIMES

TO ME CYCLADES IS STILL THE BEST OF THE BUNCH ALTHOUGH YOU CAN'T REALLY GO WRONG WITH ANY OF THEM
PERSONALLY I REALLY DID NOT ENJOY CYCLADES AUCTIONS TOOK TOO LONG IT WAS ANNOYING LOOKING UP THE MONSTERS EVERYTIME THE SYMBOLOGY WASN'T TOO HELPFUL AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ANYTHING SET UP MILITARILY BECAUSE IT'S SO APPARENT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IT WAS A SLOG I'VE HEARD THE EXPANSION MAKES THIS BETTER BUT I'M NOT BRYNA SPEND ON TOP OF A GAME TO MAKE IT PLAYABLE

FOR ME EMET IS MUCH FASTER YOU CAN TRY OUT NEW STRATEGIES EACH TIME AND PLAYS WELL AT CYCLADES PROBABLY ONLY

HOWEVER YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR PROPONENTS OF BOTH GAMES I WOULD SUGGEST YOU FIGURE OUT IF YOU GROUP IS AP PRONE IF YOU LIKE AUCTIONS OR IF YOU LIKE CONSTANT FIGHTING RATHER THAN CAREFUL POSITIONING IT'S REALLY GONNA BE GROUP DEPENDENT
COAM CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD DIFFERENT MECHANICS THAN BLOOD RAGE CYCLADES ANIS EMET

THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN DISCUSSED MANY A TIME


MAN WHAT A GREAT IDEA IF ANYONE IS IN THE LA REGION AND WOULD BE WILLING TO SHOW ME HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
WOW I HAD NO IDEA PEOPLE IN MY AREA WERE ON THE BOARDGAMES REDDIN I MAY OR MAY NOT BE THERE I'M ALREADY GOING ALL IN ON ADM THOUGH
I LIVE IN SOUTH JERSEY NEAR PHILADELPHIA AND WOULD ALWAYS WELCOME THE CHANCE TO PLAY THE GAME MORE I ALSO HAVE ALL CURRENT EXPANSIONS AS WELL
AWESOME IF I WAS NEARBY I'D BE THERE
VARIES WIDELY PARTICULARLY WHO MADE IT SOMETIMES THEY ARE CHEAP CASH GRABS OR MADE BY PEOPLE WITHOUT MUCH BOARDGAME EXPERIENCE AND MAY HAVE A GOOD IDEA BUT IT'S POORLY DEVELOPED OR IMPLEMENTED

SOME ARE GREAT HOWEVER AS WAS THE CASE WITH STARCRAFT

BLOODBORNE IS MADE BY ERIC LANG SO IT DEFINITELY HAS THAY GOING FOR IT
BIOSHOCK INFINITE SIEGE OF COLOMBIA IS EXTREMELY FUN TO ME IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THEMATIC GAMES DEPTH OF PLAY STRATEGY LUCK COMBOS ETC I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT
I MEAN ANYTHING THAT TRIES TO CONFINE ITSELF WITHIN THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH BY ANOTHER MEDIUM IS GOING TO HAVE A ROUGH START AND PEOPLE WILL GIVE IT A HARD TIME NO MATTER WHAT SEEMED TO DO WELL AND I'VE HEARD UNCHARTED IS A DECENT GAME GENERALLY THOUGH I DON'T THINK THEY TRANSLATE ALL THAT SMOOTHLY
BCOM IS GOOD I'VE HEARD CIV WAS GOOD AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING IT SOON THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT VIDEO GAMES GET TO HAVE THOUSAND PAGE RULE BOOKS BECAUSE ONLY THE COMPUTER NEEDS TO READ THEM ONLY THE SIMPLEST CONCEPTS CAN TRANSLATE INTO A GAME A GREAT EXAMPLE IS POTION EXPLOSION IT'S NOT REALLY BEJEWELED BUT IT'S LIKE THE SAME IDEA EVEN SIMPLER AND IT MAKES A PERFECT BOARD GAME
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE MAP I ACTUALLY THOUGHT DOOM BY FFA WAS PRETTY GOOD I HAVEN'T PLAYED THE NEWER EDITION YET THOUGH PRETTY MUCH ALL THE OLDER GAMES MONOPOLY RISK YAHTZEE TRIVIAL PURSUIT ARE HIDEOUS CASH GRABS I FOUND THE WITCHER MORE DISAPPOINTING THAN BAD

I CAN'T SPEAK TO BLOODBORNE THOUGH HAVEN'T PLAYED IT
I KICKSTARTED DARK SOULS BOARD GAME AND AM HOPEFUL THAT IT IS ENTERTAINING ONE GUY IN MY GROUP IS A MASSIVE FAN OF DS

DUNNO ABOUT BLOODBORNE HAVEN'T CHECKED OUT BG OR VG OF IT

BUT IN GENERAL YEAH I'M USUALLY PRETTY WARY OF BG MADE AFTER AGS CAN EASILY COME OFF AS A TO ANOTHER AUDIENCE FOR WHATEVER POSSIBLE MINIMAL CASH GRAB LURE TO VG BUT THAT'S ME MAYBE I'M A BIT JADED
BLOODBORNE CARD GAME LOOKS PRETTY COOL MIGHT PICK IT UP I'VE CONSIDERED THE RESIDENT EVIL DECK BUILDING GAME BUT I'M NOT A HUGE RE FAN SO I'LL PROBABLY STICK WITH OTHER DECK BUILDERS I LOVE THE WITCHER BUT I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE BOARD GAME ADAPTATION
THE BLOODBORNE CARD GAME SUCKS JUST TO SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY
I WOULD ADD SOME VARIATION TO CASTLES OF BURGUNDY S COLOR PALETTE AND RE-RELEASE IT WITH ALL OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP PLAYER BOARDS BECAUSE THEY'RE AWESOME
I WOULD CHANGE THE FALL SYMBOL IN KEYFLOWER FROM WHATEVER LEAF IT CURRENTLY IS TO A MAPLE LEAF SO THAT IT IS EASIER TO DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE SPRING LEAF SYMBOL
SOME MORE VARIABLE SET UPS FOR CAVERN INSTEAD OF JUST THE STANDARD ONES FOR EACH PLAYER COUNT
MAKE MOTTAINAI AND INNOVATION EASIER TO LEARN
I WOULD LOVE A FULLY CO-OPERATIVE MODE FOR IMPERIAL ASSAULT
ANDROID NETRUNNER NBC WOULD BE SOMEWHAT BALANCED
IN ROLL FOR THE GALAXY I'D CHANGE IT SO THAT EVERYTHING WAS CARDS AND THERE WERE NO DICE YOU'D PAY FOR THINGS BY DISCARDING CARDS FROM YOUR HAND AND YOU'D PUT A CARD FACE DOWN ON A PLANET TO SHOW IT'S GOT A GOOD INSTEAD OF A DIE SEEMS LIKE IT'D MAKE THE GAME FASTER AND MORE INTERESTING

S

FOR REAL THOUGH I GUESS I'D PROBABLY MAKE THE ROLL PLAYER MATS OUT OF THICK CARDBOARD I'D ALSO LIKE BIGGER BETTER QUALITY VP CHIPS BUT I'M WORKING ON THAT CUSTOM UPGRADE
THIS ONE IS MORE OF AN ANNOYANCE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE I'D HAVE THE MILESTONES BE EXCLUSIVE IN THEIR AWARD NO SHARING MILESTONES BETWEEN PLAYERS IN THE EVENT TWO PLAYERS WOULD ACHIEVE ONE HAVE TURN ORDER DECIDE WHO GETS IT THAT WE DON'T TRY MORE TO ENCOURAGE PLAYERS TO BE AS DIFFERENT AS POSSIBLE AND CREATE STRATEGIES AROUND THAT DIFFERENCE IS A SHORTCOMING OF THE GAME TO ME IT'S A PERFECTLY FINE GAME AS IS BUT IT COULD HAVE BETTER IN MY EYES

I GET THE REASON YOU HAVE TO DRAW YOUR CUBES AND THEN DUMP AND SORT EVERYTHING IN SNCF PARIS CONNECTION BUT IT STILL SUCKS TO DO IT I'M NOT SURE I HAVE A SOLUTION THERE THAT MAINTAINS THAT HIDDEN INFORMATION ASPECT OF IT WHICH I THINK IS A CORE PIECE

LAST BUT NOT LEAST I THINK THE ARAN US COALITION IS TOO POWERFUL IN FIRE IN THE LAKE FOR EITHER THE VC VA TO REALLY GET A FOOTHOLD AND SUCCESS REQUIRES THAT THE COIN SIDE TO NOT WORK TOGETHER WELL AND I'VE SEEN MULTIPLE GAMES WITH EXPERIENCED PLAYERS WHERE THEY DO ELIMINATE THE VC FROM PLAY BEAT ON THE VA A LITTLE BIT AND THE ARAN WIN I'VE DONE IT AND HAD IT DONE TO ME AS WELL IT'S INTENDED TO BE A GAME BUT IT REALLY COMES OFF AS A THAT DEGENERATES TO EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF AT VARIOUS RATES OF SPEED DEPENDING ON WHO IS PLAYING BECAUSE OF THE EFFICIENCY OF USING THE THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND FOR NOW PRINCIPLE FOR AS MANY GAMES OF THIS AS I HAVE PLAYED I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT I'D DO TO CHANGE IT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH INCENTIVE FOR THE COIN SIDES TO BICKER IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE GAME REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY COUP CARDS THERE ARE
I WOULD GET RID OF THE BASE RULES IN TRICERION MAKING THE DARK ALLEY A PART OF THE BASE GAME I'M CONVINCED SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE TRICERION IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE ONLY PLAYED THE SIMPLIFIED VERSION
DOMINION I WOULD CHANGE THE ARTWORK DOMINION IS AN AMAZING GAME BUT IT OFTEN LOOKS HORRIBLE JUST LOOK AT THE MAIN LOGO
LORDS OF WATERDEEP WITH MEEDLESS INSTEAD OF CUBES
KEY MARKET I WOULD REPRINT IT SO I COULD OWN A COPY WITH UPGRADED COMPONENTS SO THE RESOURCES WOULDN'T SPLIT INTO LAYERS ORIGINAL MADE OF PLYWOOD
IN ALCHEMISTS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE CUBES AVAILABLE IS TOO FEW AND MORE TURNS IS NOT ENOUGH

MAGICALLY I WOULD LIKE THE LENGTH TO BE THE SAME THOUGH
JUST BOUGHT ANIS AND THE VICTORY CONDITIONS AREN'T ON THE PLAYER CARD WHY
STAR REALMS IF I HAD TO PICK JUST ONE THING TO CHANGE ABOUT IT I WOULD HAVE THE FIRST PLAYER GET ONLY 2 CARDS BUT HE COULD PICK THEM

SEVERAL OF THE GAMBITS EVENTS COULD USE A RE-DO AS COULD THE PROMOS BUT AT LEAST IN THE BASE GAME THE FIRST PLAYER JUST HAS TOO MUCH OF AN ADVANTAGE
LOCATION REFERENCE CARDS IN SPYFAULT ONE FOR EACH PLAYER I'VE SAID THIS SINCE DAY BEFORE ASEL
ESCAPE WOULD HAVE A MORE NOTICEABLE NOISE TO SIGNAL YOU TO MOVE BACK TO THE CENTER IT BLENDS INTO THE BACKGROUND DRUMS TOO EASILY


I WOULD LIKE BLOOD RAGE TO HAVE THICK CARDBOARD RATHER THAN THIN CARDSTOCK MATS
INCLUDE 3D MINIATURES OR AT LEAST BETTER ART ON THE TILES FOR FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE WITH THAT SAID IT'S STILL ONE OF MY TOP GAMES
I WOULD CHANGE CERTAIN PLAYERS IN GAMES LIKE SECRET HITLER THERE ARE TWO THAT JOIN IN SOMETIMES AND I'LL CATCH THEM TRYING TO LOOK AT POLICY CARDS SOMETIMES WHEN THE P OR C IS SITTING NEXT TO THEM

I WOULD ALSO CHANGE BLOOD RAGE TO NOT HAVE SO MANY DAMN MECHANICS LOCKED BEHIND SE
I'D MAKE SENTINELS OF THE UNIVERSE SCALE BETTER WITH DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PLAYERS OR AT LEAST MAKE IT WORK WITH TWO HEROES OR EVEN ONE FOR SOLO IN PLAY OUT OF THE BOX WITHOUT NEEDING TO COME UP WITH VARIANTS OR PLAYING MULTIPLE HANDS
BUT DOES IDKFA STILL WORK
WAIT SO THE GAME INCLUDES AN EXPANSION FOR A DIFFERENT GAME HOPEFULLY I AM MISUNDERSTANDING THIS
LOOKS TO ME LIKE BONUSES WHEN YOU SELL CERTAIN COLOURS OF GOODS

SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE A NEAT ADDITION REMINDS ME A BIT OF THE BOATS MODULE IN BRUGES CITY OF THE AWIN BUFFING AN ACTION ALREADY IN THE BASE GAME
I THINK THE EXPANSION WOULD BE FOR THE BOARD VERSION NOT THE CARD ONE
YEAH BUT MINE IS MORE LEGIT HETP
IS UNBALANCED ALWAYS ROLLS A
THAT LOOKS AMAZING THEY'D PROBABLY ENJOY IT OVER AT R DANDIE TOO
WHILE THIS IS SUPER COOL WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT A DICE TOWER I ALWAYS WONDERED AS IT TAKES THE JOY OF ACTUALLY ROLLING THE DICE
HOW TO COME BY THE PARTS THAT WERE USED FOR THIS IS THE TOWER 3D PRINTED
CAN I SHOW OFF MINE TOO


IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE ONE


SPECIFICALLY

ALSO JOIN US AT R HIRSTARTS
NICE BUT BROKEN IT'S THE SAME NUMBER EVERYTIME I WATCH
CITADELS
THAT'S PRETTY AWESOME RTF DOESN'T SEEM VERY DICE TOWER FRIENDLY THOUGH HEH
I READ THIS POST AS MY HOUSEMATE IS AN AMAZING DICE TOWER I WAS CONFUSED AND WANTED TO SEE WHERE THIS WAS GOING
I WANT ONE
WOW THIS LOOK ABSOLUTELY AWESOME
DOES THIS HELP COMBAT AGAINST DICE BIAS
BUT BUT IT ONLY ROLLS S

SERIOUSLY THOUGH THAT'S BADASS PROPS TO YOUR BUDDY
THAT IS AWESOME
SO BADASS
THIS IS OOOO AWESOME LOVE THE DETAIL WHERE TO GET
I AM IN THE SAME BOAT I WAS BACKING FEUDUM BUT NOW AT THE PLEDGE LEVEL ON BOTH WHILE I DECIDE WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT FEUDUM BUT GETTING CONCERNED WITH THE LACK OF REVIEWS AND PLAY THROUGHS AND TO GET THE COMPLETE GAME WITH EXPANSIONS SHIPPED IS THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR AN NEW DESIGNER PUBLISHER

I ALSO FIND IT KIND OF SKETCHY THAT HE IS STILL USING QUOTE ABOUT HOW HE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE GAME TO COME OUT EVEN AFTER RADIO DECLINED A PROTOTYPE AFTER READING THE RULES

I WAS HOPING TO HEAR FEEDBACK FROM OTHERS FROM BG CON BUT I'M STARTING TO THINK HE DIDN'T TAKE THE GAME WITH HIM
CANCELLED MY FEUDUM AND WENT FOR LISBOA LACERNA HAS A GOOD TRACK RECORD RUN THROUGH WAS FANTASTIC AND A SOLO VAGIENT IS BEING WORKED ON BY LACERNA TOO

FEUDUM LOOKS INTERESTING BY I'M GOING WITH LISBOA
VITAL LACERNA GAME WITH IAN O'TOOLE ART VS SOMETHING ELSE

YEAH I WENT WITH LISBOA NOT EVEN A CHOICE
WHICHEVER HAS THE BEST STRETCH GOALS WITH SHIPPING THEY ARE BOTH WITHIN OF RETAIL PRICE SO YOU CAN PICK THEM UP LATER WITHOUT WORRYING
FRANKLY I HATE THE STYLE THAT FEUDUM HAS GONE WITH IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE AN ATTRACTIVE GAME TO ME BUT IT CERTAINLY IS UNIQUE
NEITHER IF MONEY IS TIGHT YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY AN EXPENSIVE GAME THAT YOU MIGHT NOT END UP ENJOYING
I WENT WITH FEUDUM BUT THAT'S MOSTLY BASED ON ME PREFERRING THE ART STYLE
I GOT BOTH BUT IF I WERE FORCED TO CHOOSE I'D GO LISBOA VITAL HAS A GREAT TRACK RECORD IN MY BOOKS AND I HATED MISSING THE ALLERGIST FIRST TIME AROUND
I AM BACKING FEUDUM THE ART STYLE IS INCREDIBLE AND BASED ON THE RULE BOOK IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY COMPELLING AND ORIGINAL GAME I ALSO REALLY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THE WHOLE THING IS A LABOR OF LOVE


LISBOA ALSO LOOKS GREAT BUT I AM PRETTY WARY OF THE PUBLISHER EAGLE GRYPHON THEY HAVE DONE SOME SHADY THINGS
NEITHER IF YOU CAN ONLY AFFORD TO BACK ONE OF THEM YOU'RE BETTER OFF BUYING A GAME THAT'S ALREADY IN PRINTING
BY THE WAY LOOK AT FILE FOR A FREE DOWNLOAD OF NEW SOLO OPPONENT'S MUCH MORE FUN THAN THE ONES IN THE BOX
LEAVE THE ENERGY MARKER AT MAXIMUM AND EXPAND ITS EMPIRE AT THE END OF ITS NEXT TURN

I FOUND THE ANSWER OVER ON BG
ARTICLE




PUERTO RICO IS THE GAME YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
TO BE HONEST SOMETHING LIKE DOMINION ISN'T HUGELY DEPENDENT ON LUCK I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GAMES WITH PERFECT INFORMATION THAT'S MORE OF A FEATURE THAN A GENRE SO SUGGESTIONS WILL VARY WILDLY

FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE AND BATTLETOWN ARE THE ONLY TWO THAT I CAN THINK OF WITH PERFECT INFO PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING ELSE HAS RANDOMNESS SOMEWHERE MOSTLY IN SET UP EVEN FM IS GUILTY OF THAT
CONCORDIA
GO
LOOK UP TZOLKIN THE MAYAN CALENDAR
DIPLOMACY THOUGH PLAY WITH PEOPLE YOU ARE READY TO DUMP AS FRIENDS
IF YOU HATE YOUR FRIENDS GIVE DIPLOMACY A SHOT
TERRA MYSTIC IS MY GO TO DEEP STRATEGY GAME IT LOOKS COMPLICATED BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY SIMPLE AND SMOOTH CANT RECOMMEND ENOUGH FOR ME AND MY GROUP ITS DEFINITELY LIKE CHESS BUT WITH MORE PLAYERS
FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE IS THE BEST STRATEGY GAME I CAN THINK OF WITH PERFECT INFORMATION EMET CYCLADES AND ANIS ARE ALL GREAT WITH PRETTY MINIMAL ANG INVOLVED
A GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME 2ND EDITION

THIS GAME CAN BE PLAYED EITHER COMPLETELY WITHOUT RANDOM ELEMENTS OR WITH A SMALL ELEMENT OF RANDOM LUCK IN THE FORM IF WILDING CARDS AT THE END OF THE ROUND

WHILE YOU WILL BE A BIT MORE INVESTED IN THE GAME IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE TV SERIES BOOKS I'VE PLAYED IT WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER WATCHED READ THE SERIES AND THEY LOVED IT ALMOST BEAT ME IN A GAME

THE GAME ITSELF IS A GRAND STRATEGY GAME WHERE EACH PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF A HOUSE AND YOU WIN IF YOU FINALLY CONTROL CASTLES CASTLES ARE DOTTED AROUND THE LAND IMAGING RISK THE LAND IS SPLIT INTO SEGMENTS BUT WITHOUT THE BULLISH ATTERY OF DICE RILLING YOU PLAN YOUR MOVES AND PLAN HOW TO MAKE AN ARMY AND WHETHER TO WAIT TO ATTACK WITH A BIG ARMY OR TO GRAB CASTLES QUICKLY YOU CAN EVEN FORGE ALLIANCES WITH OTHER PLAYERS AND CHOSE HOW AND WHEN YOU WANT TO BREAK THESE ALLIANCES

I LOVE THIS GAME AS IT'S THE ONLY PURE STRATEGY GAME THAT I'VE EVER PLAYED ITS ALL DOWN TO YOU AND YOUR DECISIONS THE ONLY MINOR SETBACK THAT I CAN THINK OF IS GAMES CAN LAST HOURS SOUNDS SCARY BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A GOOD GROUP OF FRIENDS IT'LL FLY BY
GAMES WITH LITTLE OR NO LUCK

GAMES
DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR NUMBER OF PLAYERS

MY INITIAL SUGGESTION WOULD BE PATCHWORK ONCE ITS SET UP THERE IS NO LUCK OR HIDDEN INFORMATION SO IT IS ALL DOWN TO HOW YOU PLAY IT THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THAT ITS ONLY 2 PLAYERS
EMET MIGHT BE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR NO DICE ROLLING AND MOSTLY OPEN INFORMATION
WE HAVE FOUND LIBERALIA AND REVOLUTION TO BE LESS THAN CATAN AND THE LIKE AS EVERYONE TAKES THEIR TURNS AT THE SAME TIME AND THE GAMES FEEL QUITE FAIR BALANCED
AHH YOU SPEAK MY LANGUAGE NO LUCK

TRY MEDINA 2ND EDITION HANSA TEUTONIA THE ALLERGIST BRUXELLES CAVERN AND MEXICA TO NAME A FEW RANDOM DRAWS ONLY FOR SET UP IN SOME OF THEM OTHERWISE EVERYTHING IS PUBLIC INFO AND STATIC MOSTLY BUT LUCK IS A MINOR FACTOR IN THESE GAMES

FUNNY HOW THESE I ALL RATED BASICALLY TOP TEN OR TWENTY I ABHOR GAMES WHERE BAD LUCK CAN COST YOU THE GAME
POWER GRID



CHESS WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT A GAME THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE PLAYERS HAS SOME BUILDING ASPECT TOO IT LIKE A MIX BETWEEN STRATEGE AND CATAN I GUESS WOULD BE THE BEST CLUE I COULD GIVE
CAELUS HAS NO RANDOM ELEMENTS AFTER SETUP INITIAL PLAYER ORDER AND THE POSITIONS OF THE INITIAL BUILDINGS ARE RANDOM
GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME IS ENTIRELY STRATEGIC PLAY WITHOUT THE TIDES OF BATTLE CARDS AND GOES UP TO PLAYER
IMPERIAL COMES TO MIND
HIVE IS A GREAT 2 PLAYER PURE STRATEGY GAME IT IS THE ONLY NEWER BOARD GAME COMPARABLE TO CHESS THAT I'VE PLAYED I SUGGEST THE POCKET EDITION IT'S NOT TOO SMALL BUT COMES WITH MOST THE EXPANSION PIECES
TIGRIS EUPHRATES I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME ENOUGH
YOU MIGHT NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT

I'D SAY ANY ABSTRACT STRATEGY GAMES ARE GOOD GIF PROJECT GAMES ARE PURELY STRATEGIC LUCK INVOLVED TAK AS WELL
SO CHESSYLITE GAMES THEN TWO PLAYERS NO LUCK PERSONALLY HOMEWORLDS IS MY FAVORITE IT'S AN ICEHOUSE SYSTEM GAME WHERE YOU BUILD UP AN INTERSTELLAR ARMY AND EITHER CAPTURE OR DESTROY YOUR OPPONENT'S HOME PLANET

BATTLETOWN IS ALSO GOOD THERE'S NO LUCK BUT THERE IS HIDDEN INFORMATION IT'S A GAME THAT SIMULATES HIGH-LEVEL FIGHTING GAME STRATEGY THE IDEA BEING THAT ULTIMATELY ONCE YOU ADVANCE PAST BUTTON MASHING FIGHTING GAMES ARE JUST VERY HIGH-SPEED BLUFFING GAMES IN BATTLETOWN YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE INFORMATION YOUR OPPONENT DOES AT ALL TIMES EXCEPT FOR WHAT ATTACK THEY'VE LOCKED IN
CHICAGO EXPRESS HAS NO LUCK OR RANDOMNESS YET SOMEHOW TURNS OUT VERY DIFFERENTLY EVERY TIME ALSO PLAYS QUICKLY ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES
WOULD AGRICOLA FIT THE BILL

THE ONLY PART OF THE GAME THAT IS RANDOMIZED IS WHICH ORDER THE ACTION CARDS FLIP OVER YOU CAN ALSO PLAY SUPER COMPETITIVE OR MORE LAID BACK ALTHOUGH SOME MIGHT DISAGREE

I'VE PLAYED WITH MY HS BOARD GAME CLUB AND PEOPLE EITHER TARGET THE ACTIONS OTHERS WANT OR SPECIFICALLY AVOID THEM AND HOPE THE FAVOR IS RETURNED OF COURSE THAT MEANS YOU USUALLY END UP WITH PEOPLE SPECIALIZING IN ONE METHOD OF WINNING THEN BRANCH OUT ONLY TO PREVENT NEGATIVE POINTS
GAMES THAT HAVE NO GAME RANDOMNESS AFTER SETUP ONLY PLAYER RANDOMNESS

I THINK OF IT AS ROCK PAPER SCISSORS THE PLAYER IS THE ONE ROLLING THE ANG SO TO SPEAK WHICH YOU CAN ARGUABLY CONSIDER THAT LUCK OR NOT SINCE ITS UNLIKELY WE'LL DISCOVER TELEPATHY ANY TIME SOON

STEAM RAILS TO RICHES

HEY THAT'S MY FISH

TERRA MYSTIC

REVOLUTION STEVE JACKSON GAMES

HIVE COULD JUST BE CONSIDERED AN ABSTRACT GAME LIKE GO OR SHOGI OR OTHELLO BUT OH WELL

PATCHWORK

AGRICOLA CREATURES BIG AND SMALL NOTE THIS IS GAME IS NOT IN PRINT PROBABLY BOUGHT OUT BY MAYFAIR AND TO BE REPRINTED IN IF I WERE TO GUESS

NOT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT THE ODDEST MIX OF LUCK AND STRATEGY THAT I'VE EVER RUN INTO IS BLOOD BOWL THE GAME IS SO UTTERLY RANDOM THAT IF YOU DON'T APPLY STRATEGY AND STICK TO IT YOU WILL BE HOPELESSLY LOST IT'S KIND OF WEIRD THE WAY THE TWO ELEMENTS BLEND
SUBURBIA THIS IS THE GAME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
LOOK FOR ABSTRACT GAMES GAMES LIKE BATTLE SHEEP OR QUARIDOR OR ONITAMA GAMES WHERE INFORMATION ISN'T HIDDEN AND THEN ALL YOU HAVE LEFT ARE TACTICS WITH EXTREMELY MINIMAL LUCK
GAMES DON'T HAVE LUCK PAST SETUP THEY ARE PRETTY LONG AND UNFORGIVING BUT MUCH LESS INTIMIDATING THAN THEIR REPUTATION SUGGESTS GMT JUST PUT OUT A GREAT EDITION OF PROBABLY THE BEST TIME TO JUMP IN ON IT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

I AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE MIGHT BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THOUGH
I REALLY LIKE THE GAME OF THRONES BOARD GAME WHICH HAS BARELY ANY LUCK INVOLVED
STRATEGE
2 PLAYER BATTLETOWN BY FAR THINK STREET FIGHTER BUT PURE NON RANDOM CARD PLAY IT'S HONESTLY AMAZING

MORE PLAYERS REVOLUTION EVERY TURN IS DETERMINISTIC THE SAME INPUTS ALWAYS PRODUCE THE SAME OUTPUTS
THE CATCH IS IT'S A BLIND AUCTION SO YOU DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN IF YOU'LL WIN ANYTHING
NO LUCK BUT THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF OTHER PLAYERS CAUSE SOME PEOPLE TO FEEL IT IS RANDOM

BLOCKUS CAVIA DRAT

CATACOMBS IS A DEXTERITY GAME
GAME OF THRONES REALLY AND ALMOST COMPLETELY BASED ON STRATEGY OUTSIDE OF CARDS BETWEEN EACH ROUND THAT CHANGE ALLOWABLE ORDERS AND THE WILDLINGS
I SEE THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE SOME GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW GAMES IN THIS THREAD HIVE AND SAMURAI WOULD BE A COUPLE THAT I WOULD SECOND BUT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT SOME GAMES DO HAVE VARIANT WAYS TO PLAY TO REDUCE LUCK WHICH CAN BE PRETTY INTERESTING FOR INSTANCE WITH SETTLERS YOU CAN REPLACE THE DICE ROLL WITH DRAWING NUMBERS FROM A BAG THAT IS SEEDED WITH THE CORRECT PROPORTION OF NUMBERS THEN YOU DON'T REFILL THE BAG UNTIL EVERYTHING IS PICKED YOU STILL HAVE THE RANDOMNESS OF WHAT NUMBER IS DRAWN WHEN BUT IT REDUCES THE RANDOMNESS OF THINGS LIKE 2 OR HITTING FAR MORE OFTEN THEN THEY PROPORTIONALLY WOULD
THE KING IS DEAD
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

NO LUCK PERFECT INFORMATION
PLAYERS
STRATEGY GAMES

PUERTO RICO IS MY RECOMMENDATION IT'S A CLASSIC EURO GAME THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE AND WAS VERY INFLUENTIAL TO A LOT OF MODERN GAME DESIGN THERE'S NO HIDDEN INFORMATION OR RANDOMNESS AND EVERYTHING IS AVAILABLE TO YOU FROM THE START OF THE GAME STRATEGY IS DEEP IT ALSO SUPPORTS PLAYERS
YOU SAID YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A PARTY GAME BELOW WELL PARTY GAMES AS A GENRE ARE GENERALLY MORE SOCIAL GAMES WHICH ARE NOT SUPER STRATEGY HEAVY AND OFTEN CONTAIN LUCK BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS TO WIN I'M MAKING MY SUGGESTION BASED ON THE FACT THAT PUERTO RICO SUPPORTS PLAYERS AS YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO FIND A PARTY GAME THAT FITS YOUR CRITERIA VERY WELL YOU COULD SAY THAT CODENAMES HAS NO LUCK I GUESS THE STRATEGY THOUGH ISN'T SUPER DEEP AND IT'S MAINLY CENTERED AROUND THE PAYMASTER GIVING CLUES THAT THEIR TEAM UNDERSTANDS IT'S NOT A BOARD GAME LIKE RISK OR CATAN AS MUCH AS IT'S A PARTY GAME LIKE CHARADES OR DICTIONARY
TERRA MYSTIC AND PUERTO RICO ARE BOTH VERY LOW ON THE LUCK FACTOR
NEARLY ALL OF THE GAMES ARE RANDOMNESS FREE EXCEPT FOR INITIAL SEATING ORDER

CONTAINER IS ALSO RANDOMNESS FREE EXCEPT FOR INITIAL SETUP

DIPLOMACY

NEARLY ALL ABSTRACT GAMES


LUCK IN THE MANHATTAN PROJECT IS LIMITED TO THE ORDER THE BUILDINGS APPEAR AND WHICH BOMB SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE IN BOTH CASES YOU WILL USUALLY HAVE PLAYER TURNS BEFORE ANYONE CAN OR WILL BRING THE NEW BUILDINGS OR SCHEMATICS INTO PLAY SO YOU HAVE TIME TO ADJUST YOUR STRATEGY VERY TENSE GAME AND AT P YOU WILL BE THINKING WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS
GATES OF LOYANG
SORRY TAKING SO LONG TO GET BACK TO THESE HAD A FUN WEEKEND AND SPENT ALL OF YESTERDAY WAY TO HANGOVER TO FUNCTION AS A HUMAN ANYWAYS RANDOMIZATION AT SETUP IS COMPLETELY FINE HOWEVER DOMINION IS ABOUT HALF LUCK HALF STRATEGY LIKE ANY CARD GAME I HAVE HEARD A LOT OF TERRA MYSTIC THINK I WILL GIVE THAT A GO AND TZOLKIN DEFINITELY LOOKS INTERESTING THANKS FOR THOSE SUGGESTIONS
HOW DO YOU GET LUCKY WITH DOMINION
MY FAVORITE LIMITED TO NO LUCK GAMES ARE THE FOLLOWING BLOOD RAGE IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY DICE AND CARDS ARE SELECTED THROUGH DRAFTING KEYFLOWER AUCTION TILE PLACEMENT AND WORKER PLACEMENT GAME THE ONLY LUCK PARTS ARE YOUR WINTER TILE GOALS AND WHAT TILES OUT OF THE STACK COME UP EACH SEASON CAVERN PURE WORKER PLACEMENT GAME

THAT'S ABOUT ALL I CAN THINK OF OUT OF MY COLLECTION THAT HAVE ALMOST NO LUCK AT ALL
CHESS GO CHECKERS


I'M FROM CAPE TOWN SO I CAN'T REALLY HELP YOU ON THE BRICK AND MORTAR FRONT BUT I CAN RECOMMEND SOME ONLINE STORES YOU COULD ORDER FROM

TIMELESS BOARD GAMES

AARU

TAKEALOT

DIGITAL SUSHI

GEEK HOME NEVER PERSONALLY ORDERED FROM THIS SITE BUT THEY SEEM TO BE THE ONLINE STORE FOR OUTER LIMITS IN PRETORIA
COBURG DOES NOT HAVE TONS OF BRICK AND MORTAR SHOPS BETWEEN BOTH COBURG AND PRETORIA YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF OPTIONS THOUGH

OUTER LIMITS IN BELLVILLE CHB
OUTER LIMITS IN LYNNWOOD PTA
BATTLE WIZARDS IN CENTURION PTA

YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING CONCORDIA SPECIFICALLY I ONLY RECENTLY GOT MY OWN COPY HERE

I WOULD SAY GO AND SEE IF OUTER LIMITS IN CHB HAS A COPY I KNOW IT RECENTLY CAME IN WITH A SHIPMENT BUT ONLY LIMITED COPIES WERE AVAILABLE TO GO TO ALL THE DIFFERENT SUPPLIERS SO I SNATCHED ONE HOPE THIS HELPS

RECENTLY BOUGH SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM FROM TAKEALOT AND ABOUT TO BUY CARCASSONNE

YOU CAN ALSO BUY THEM ON AMAZON A LOT OF THE GAMES ACTUALLY SHIP HERE WITH THE IMPORT TAX AND SHIPPING IT CAN EITHER END UP AROUND THE SAME PRICE AS HERE OR EVEN SLIGHTLY CHEAPER USEFUL IF YOU NEED SOMETHING RARE I GUESS
I ENJOY BATTLETOWN TREMENDOUSLY BUT IT SUFFERS FROM THE SAME PROBLEM THAT MY COPY OF MAGE WARS EXHIBITS I BELIEVE YOU REALLY NEED A CONSISTENT DEDICATED PARTNER S TO REALLY UNLOCK WHAT THE GAME HAS TO OFFER IF IT'S GOING TO BE THE KIND OF THING THAT COMES OFF THE SHELF ONCE IN A WHILE YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF WITH AT LEAST A SMALL DEGREE OF BUYER'S REMORSE BUT IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY SPEND THE TIME WITH IT TO MAKE IT SHINE IT'S ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE MOST SATISFYING BATTLERS ON THE MARKET
I LOVE BATTLETOWN BECAUSE IT DOES AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF REPLICATING THE BATTLEGROUND OF PERFECT KNOWLEDGE THAT COMPETITIVE FIGHTING CAN BE AND DOESN'T FEEL HAM-FISTED WITH HOW IT INCORPORATES FIGHTING GAME CONCEPTS LIKE POSITIONING AND PARRYING THE FACT THAT THERE ARE UNIQUE CHARACTERS IN THE ENTIRE ROSTER EACH WITH THEIR OWN POLYSTYLE AND MOVEMENTS GIVES IT HUGE DEPTH PROVIDED YOU'RE WILLING TO PUT IN THE TIME TO REALLY NAIL DOWN THE FUNDAMENTALS REALLY THE ONLY BARRIER IS TIME IT CAN TAKE A WHILE TO CLICK BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND WILLING TO PLAY IT WITH YOU OVER AND OVER MAN WHEN IT CLICKS IT'S AN ABSOLUTE BLAST
BACON IS AMAZING SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN MINUTES TO TEACH BUT THERE ARE SOME SUBTLETIES IN THE RULES TO PICK UP

IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL IN EMULATING THE FEEL OF A FIGHTER AND IT'S ENJOYABLE ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT FOR THE FIRST FEW GAMES IT WILL PROBABLY SEEM LIKE YOU'RE JUST FLOUNDERING ABOUT UNTIL YOU LEARN HOW TO PICK GOOD CARD COMBINATIONS AFTER THAT YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO PICK CARD COMBINATIONS THAT BEAT YOUR OPPONENT'S OPTIONS THIS IS WHERE THE MEAT OF THE GAME IS THE WHOLE GAME PRETTY MUCH REVOLVES AROUND YOUR OPPONENT THE CLOSEST ANALOGUE FOR TURN TO TURN PLAY IS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE COMPETITIVE POKÉMON

START WITH THE REMASTERIES EDITION OF WAR OR DEVASTATION FATE HAS MORE COMPLICATED CHARACTERS THAT BEGINNERS WON'T HANDLE AS WELL CHARACTERS ARE DIVIDED UP INTO DIFFICULTY FLIGHTS WHICH ROUGHLY SORT THEM BASED ON HOW HARD THEY ARE TO PLAY YOUR FIRST GAMES AT LEAST SHOULD PROBABLY BE IN THE FIRST TIERS ONLY JUST TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS
IF THEY ALREADY LIKE LEGENDARY YOU MIGHT CONSIDER CHECKING OUT PUZZLE STRIKE IT DOES FIGHTING GAMES IN THE STYLE OF A DECK BUILDER

I BOUGHT WAR OF INDENES A LONG TIME AGO BUT I NEVER REALLY GOT TO PLAY IT THE PEOPLE I TYPICALLY GAME WITH FOUND IT TO BE TOO MUCH OF A BRAIN BURNER AND HATED IT IT FEELS FAIRLY THE PEOPLE WHO LIKED IT I DON'T PLAY WITH FREQUENTLY ENOUGH FOR IT TO BE A GOOD CHOICE AS IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO LEARN AND DOESN'T PROPERLY GET FUN UNLESS BOTH PARTIES ARE VERY EXPERIENCED THIS MIGHT NOT BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU AT ALL JUST BE CAREFUL THE PEOPLE WHO HATED BATTLETOWN WERE TOO HAVING PLAYED STUFF A LOT HEAVIER THAN LEGENDARY BUT THEY WERE NOT VIDEO GAMERS SO DISINTEREST IN THE THEME MAY HAVE BEEN PART OF WHAT KILLED IT

PUZZLE STRIKE IS PRETTY ABSTRACT BUT IT'S EASY TO LEARN AND YOU CAN PLAY IT AS A CHILL GAME WITHOUT NEEDING TO THINK TOO MUCH BUT IT'S DEEP ENOUGH YOU TOTALLY CAN DO TOURNAMENT RULES AND REALLY THINK THINGS THROUGH UNLIKE MOST DECKBUILDERS IT IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE YOU ATTACK EACH OTHER AS WELL AS BUY BASED ON AND YOUR OPPONENT'S BUYS IT'S MY FAVORITE 2 PLAYER GAME AND THE FAVORITE OF MY FAMILY AS WELL DESPITE THEM HAVING NO IDEA WHAT A SUPER PUZZLE FIGHTER IS

I'VE ALSO HEARD EXCEED IS A LOT EASIER TO LEARN THAN BATTLETOWN AND JUST AS GOOD
I'VE ALSO HEARD OF BOMI BUT I THINK BATTLETOWN IS MORE ACCESSIBLE FROM WHERE I'M AT
BATTLETOWN IS FINE BUT IT HAS A VERY PLODDING STYLE AND A LOT OF PHASES TO RESOLVE IN A SINGLE CARD PLAY

IT'S SUPER DOPE IN THE MANNER THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF YOUR OPPONENTS CARDS AND CAN ATTEMPT TO BOMI OUT WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO BUT THAT TBQH TAKES A TON OF PLAYS TO GET THE POINT YOU CAN BE A BIT MORE CONFIDENT IN READING YOUR OPPONENT

IT IS FROM THAT IN WHICH I TEND TO RECOMMEND EXCEED BY THE SAME DESIGNER AS BC IT IS MUCH MORE FLASHY POP POP POP TYPE OF GAME WHERE YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR MOVEMENT HAS A SIMPLER RESOLUTION IMO AND I THINK IS MORE FUN FOR A CASUAL AS WELL AS IS EASIER TO GET OTHER FRIENDS INTO

THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T REALLY GET IS THE EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF CONTENT CREATED FOR BACON I SUPPOSE IT'S LIKE SAYING TEKKEN VS SF VS WHATEVER IN ITS OWN RIGHT I JUST PREFER THE SNAPPINESS OF EXCEED WHEN I AM IN THE MOOD FOR THAT THEN AGAIN THERE ARE SOME DAYS I LOVE TO READ AN OPPONENT AND CONTROL THEM IN BOMI BUT THERE'S NOT THAT MANY DAYS ANYMORE WHERE I FEEL LIKE I WANT TO HAVE A CHINKY SIT DOWN SLOW PLOD OF BATTLETOWN WORKS FOR SOME AND REALLY IS A GOOD GAME IT'S JUST A LITTLE SLOW FOR ME
THERE'S A DINO DICE RESKIN OF ZOMBIE DICE
KING OF TOKYO IS A GOOD DICE ROLLER FOR KIDS SKIP THE ENERGY CUBES AND CARDS IF YOU WANT
I'M THINKING MICE AND MYSTICS WHEN MY KIDS GET A LITTLE OLDER
LABYRINTH IS A GREAT GAME FOR KIDS AND FOR ALL AGES
ALL THOSE SIMPLE LITTLE SPOT IT GAMES HAVE BEEN BIG HITS WITH MY KIDS TOO EASY LITTLE CARD GAME FILLER
I HAVE A YEAR OLD BOARD GAMER TOO HIS FAVORITES RIGHT NOW ARE MONZA KNUCKLING KNIGHTS BOTH HABA GAMES ROBOT TURTLES AND MY FIRST STONE AGE

IF WE ARE INCLUDING HIS YEAR OLD BROTHER IN PLAY ANIMAL UPON ANIMAL DANCING EGGS AND STORMY SEAS ARE THE FAVORITES

I HAVEN'T COME ACROSS A SINGLE HABA OR APE GAME FOR KIDS THAT I DON'T LOVE
MONZA IS A GOOD ONE FROM HABA IT'S A KIDS VERSION OF FORMULA D OUTFOXED IS GOOD AND TEACHES SOME BASIC LOGIC HABA HAS A TON OF REALLY GOOD KIDS GAMES THAT ARE FUN FOR ADULTS TOO
MY KID TURNS TOMORROW AND HE ALSO PLAYED ZOMBIE DICE WITH ME UNTIL I SOLD IT HE LIKES TO ROLL FOR ME IN DUNGEON ROLL TOO

THE GAMES THAT HE LIKES AND REALLY UNDERSTANDS AND I WOULD RECOMMEND ARE MAGIC LABYRINTH OUTFOXED MY FIRST CARCASSONNE ENCHANTED TOWER ANIMAL UPON ANIMAL WE HAVE THE SMALL YET GREAT VERSION MIGHT WANT THE BIGGER ONE AND I SUSPECT CLICK CLACK LUMBERJACK BIRTHDAY GIFT BUT IT'S REALLY PRETTY SIMPLE
KING OF TOKYO IS A GREAT KIDS DICE GAME THAT I AM HAPPY TO PLAY WITH MY DAUGHTER WE STARTED HER THERE AT NOW SHE IS SHE IS A SMALL WORLD CATAN AND TAKENOKO FAN NOW THEY DON'T STAY AT KIDS GAMES FOR LONG
SUPERTIGHT GETTING TO SLAP TOGETHER AND CRAZY ATTRIBUTES TO CHARACTERS AND ARGUING WHO'D WIN IS ALWAYS SUPER FUNNY FOR MY NIECES AND I WHILE I'VE GOT TO EXPLAIN A FEW THINGS MOSTLY HISTORICAL FIGURES THEY STILL GET A HUGE KICK OUT OF IT
MY SON IS THAT AGE AS WELL I GOT HIM MONSTER FACTORY AND IT HAS BEEN FUN IT IS A TILE GAME SIMILAR TO CARCASSONNE BUT SIMPLER AND WITH BRIGHT SILLY MONSTERS TO BUILDING EVEN LITTLE SISTER TWO YEARS YOUNGER IS ABLE TO PLAY ALONG AND MAKE MATCHES
FISH STICKS IS NOT TERRIBLE FOR AN ADULT WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH THE KIDS

MY KIDS WERE AND FIVE AND WE PLAYED HEY THAT'S MY FISH BATTLE SHEEP AND KIDS CALASCIONE


THE YOUNGER ONE HAD TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S UP BUT THE RULES ARE SIMPLE AND HAVING HIM IN THE MIX ADDS A KIND OF CHAOTIC NEUTRAL QUALITY TO THE GAME


MY YEAR OLD SEEMS TO GET BATTLE SHEEP AND FISH STICKS AS LONG AS I AM PATIENT AN WILLING TO REMIND HER OF THE OBJECTIVES I CALL CALASCIONE THE MAP GAME AND HAVE BEEN TEACHING HER TO READ MAPS AND FOLLOW TREASURE MAPS AND SCAVENGER MAPS SINCE SHE WAS INTO DORA THE EXPLORER WHEN SHE WAS SO MAYBE SHE HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN KIDS OR CALASCIONE BUT SHE LOVES IT AND PUTS UP A GOOD FIGHT WITHOUT GUIDANCE




THERE IS A GAME CALLED BUG TRAILS THAT THEY BOTH LIKE LIKE DOMINOS WITH COLOR MATCHING SHORT AND SIMPLE

AND EASY TO LEARN SO IF YOU HAVE OTHER KID GUESTS THEY CAN PLAY TOGETHER




I HAVE HEARD THAT ENRIKA SHOULD BE GREAT FOR BOTH KIDS AND
THE AMAZING LABYRINTH IS GREAT FOR TEACHING KIDS TO THINK PLAN THEIR MOVES

KING OF TOKYO IS A GOOD DICE ROLLER WITH FANTASTIC ARTWORK KING OF NEW YORK ADDS EXTRA COMPLEXITY SO MAY NOT BE IDEAL
DEXTERITY GAMES LIKE SUSPEND CLICK CLACK LUMBERJACK OR ICE COOL WILL PROBABLY WORK I DON'T KNOW ABOUT FLICKING ABILITY AT THAT AGE BUT IF YOU THINK HE COULD HANDLE IT MAYBE FLICK EM UP

BATTERY POWERED GAMES LIKE LOOPING CHEWIE OR BUGS IN THE KITCHEN ARE ALWAYS A HIT

ALSO I'VE HEARD SOME KIDS AT THAT AGE CAN HANDLE CASTLE PANIC
MY KIDS HAVE BEEN PLAYING TICKET TO RIDE CARCASSONNE KING OF TOKYO ETC SINCE THEY WERE AND YEARS OLD IF YOUR SON IS INTERESTED LET HIM PLAY WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING DON'T DUMB IT DOWN WITH KIDS GAMES YOU WILL BE VERY SURPRISED WHAT HE'S ABSORBED AND HOW HE WILL HANDLE HIMSELF ALL I HAD TO DO WITH MY KIDS TO TEACH TR WAS TO PRACTICE CHOOSING THEIR STARTING TICKETS ONCE THEY SAW THE OVERLAP IN THE ROUTES THEY WERE GOOD TO GO AND SCORING POINTS PER GAME WITHOUT ANY HELP DON'T UNDERESTIMATE YOUR SON IF HE'S INTERESTED HE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT GAMER SOONER THAN YOU THINK
HOOT OWL HOOT IS A GOOD SUPER SIMPLE INTRODUCTION TO CO-OP PLAY EASY TO ADJUST DIFFICULTLY AS KIDS LEARN
ZOMBIE DICE BACK TO THE FUTURE DICE GAME BOTH GREAT

IF HE LIKES MOVING AND UNDERSTANDS SOME COMPLEXITY THEN ROBOT RALLY MIGHT BE FUN FOR HIM YOU GET MOVE CARDS AD PREPROGRAMMED YOUR MOVES WITH YOUR OPPONENT IN WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY CAPTURE THE FLAG ON AN OBSTACLE COURSE
BOARDGAMESWITHKIDS
ANYTHING IN THE FAMILY FRIENDLY NEW PLAYER FRIENDLY CATEGORY IS GOOD THINGS LIKE TICKET TO RIDE AND POWER GRID

CLASSIC WORD GAMES LIKE DICTIONARY SCATTEGORIES TABOO

PARTY GAMES ARE ALSO FINE LIKE SUSHI GO ONE NIGHT WEREWOLF AND TIMELINES TIMELINES IS REALLY HARD FOR KIDS THOUGH

SURPRISINGLY YOU CAN STILL PLAY MAGIC HE'LL JUST PLAY IT WRONG PROBABLY
JUNK ART IMO
INSIDER IT'S LIKE SPYFAULT BUT BETTER IN MY OPINION

MANY PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SPYFAULT DUE TO THE STRESS OF BEING THE SPY AND BEING FORCED TO MAKE UP QUESTIONS ON THE SPOT THIS ELIMINATES THAT AND ALLOWS EVERYONE TO ENJOY THE GAME A LOT MORE
THIS IS A GOOD QUESTION IN THE MAIN

QUICK GAME
2 PLAYERS INVOLVE ALL
INTUITIVE SKILL PLAY
REPEATABLE
HENCE USE OFTEN

I GUESS CODENAMES I MADE THE MISTAKE THE BUYING PICTURES WITHOUT REALIZING IT BECAUSE THE BOX IS TOO SIMILAR SO I WILL GIVE THAT AWAY AS A PRESENT AND KEEP CODENAMES

I AM INTERESTED IF THERE IS ANYTHING COMPARATIVE

CAPTAIN SONAR SOUNDS LIKE A COMPLETE RIOT IF YOU CAN GET PLAYERS AHEM ON BOARD
CODENAMES PICTURES
IT JUST CAME OUT BUT HIVE MIND WILL BE MAKING AN APPEARANCE AT THANKSGIVING FOR THIS REASON
DEAD LAST IS A BLAST IT'S DEFINITELY NOT AS CLEVER OR CREATIVE AS CODENAMES IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FEEL AND CAN GET DIVISIVE BUT IT'S A GOOD FAST FILLER KIND OF CASH GUNS ISH WITH BETTER MORE SOCIAL MECHANICS
BEEN HAVING A GREAT TIME WITH ONE NIGHT WEREWOLF VAMPIRE
I HAVEN'T PLAYED THESE MYSELF SINCE I MOSTLY PLAY IN SMALL GROUPS BUT YOU CAN LOOK UP DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG AND DEAD LAST

BOTH ARE RATED AS BEING QUITE LIGHT AND DOESN'T LAST TOO LONG
DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG
DELETED
CODENAMES

CODENAMES ICTUSES IS INCREDIBLY OVERRATED ESPECIALLY WITH A CONSISTENT PLAY GROUP
MY PARENTS WERE GAMERS I GREW UP WITH A GIANT GAME ROOM COLLECTION THAT INCLUDED GAMES THAT NO OTHER FAMILIES HAD AN ENTIRE SECTION WAS FILLED WITH HEIRLOOM GAMES FROM MY GREAT GREAT GRANDPARENTS I COME FROM GAMERS BUT I HAD BEEN LUSTING AT BG FROM AFAR FOR A VERY LONG TIME AFRAID OF THE PRICE POINTS AND NEVER HAVING PLAYED A MODERN DESIGNER BOARD GAME I LURKED BUT THE PROMISE OF NEW GAMEPLAY INTRIGUED ME AND SOMETHING TO COLLECT AS WELL I MUST BE HONEST IT WASN'T UNTIL MY BIL BROUGHT OVER PANDEMIC FOR US TO PLAY THAT I BIT THE BULLET AND ORDERED FTG I NEVER LOOKED BACK AND TO THE DETRIMENT OF MY ENTERTAINMENT BUDGET I GAVE UP BEING AFRAID OF THE PRICE POINTS TOO
I HAD AN ASSIGNMENT IN COLLEGE TO PROGRAM DOMINION I HAD NEVER HEARD OF DOMINION BUT BY THE TIME I WAS DONE I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT AND BOUGHT IT AND INTRIGUE
MY GIRLFRIEND FORCED ME TO PLAY TAKENOKO THAT GAME MADE ME QUESTION MY UNDERSTANDING OF BOARD GAME CULTURE AND I'VE EVER SINCE
MIKAL ACTUALLY I GOT IT AS A RANDOM GIFT FROM MY GRANDMOTHER WHEN SHE WENT ON A BUSINESS TRIP I WAS AND NEVER REALLY GOT ANYONE TO PLAY IT WITH ME BUT I STILL HAVE IT

IT'S SURVIVED MULTIPLE MOVES AND CAPRICIOUS PURGES OF BELONGINGS SO I FIGURE I'LL HAVE IT UNTIL I'M DEAD I HAVE GAMES NOW AND MIKAL WILL ALWAYS BE ONE OF THEM

THANKS GRANDMA I DON'T REALLY THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT A MOMENTOUS THING YOU DID FOR ME WHEN YOU PICKED OUT THAT GAME
CATAN
FOR ME IT WAS LOATHING PLAYING MONOPOLY WITH MY YR OLD DAUGHTER IT USED TO BE HER FAVORITE GAME SO I'D PLAY IT WITH HER ANYWAY I STARTED LOOKING INTO MODERN BOARDGAMES AND GOT KING OF TOKYO AND WE LOVED IT SINCE THEN WE PLAY SPLENDOR CARCASSONNE AND TICKET TO RIDE REGULARLY MY F HAS ALSO TAKEN TO IT SO WE PLAY HEAVIER GAMES AND HAVE A NICE LITTLE COLLECTION GOING JUST FROM THE LAST YEAR OR SO WITH SOME HELP FROM THIS SUB
ALWAYS GOTTA RECOMMEND COSMIC ENCOUNTER

PERSONALLY I WAS ALWAYS INTO NERDY SHIT WHICH LED TO THE GENERAL PROGRESSION OF VIDEO GAMES HOLY SHIT YOU GUYS POKEMON POKEMON TCG MAGIC WHICH LED TO GAMING MAGAZINES WHERE I HEARD ABOUT STUFF LIKE DIPLOMACY PLUS I LIKED GAMES LIKE STRATEGE AND SUCH ANYWAY SO WHEN MY COUSIN GOT ME A COPY OF ZOMBIES FOR CHRISTMAS ONE YEAR THAT WAS THE START OF IT THOUGH I DIDN'T REALLY GET HARDCORE INTO THE HOBBY UNTIL COLLEGE WHERE I DISCOVERED A BUNCH OF GAMES THROUGH THE GAMING CLUB THERE AND ALSO STARTED PICKING UP A FEW GAMES LIKE BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL AND THREE DRAGON ANTE
I FORGOT EXACTLY WHAT STARTED IT BUT SOMEHOW I WAS READING ABOUT DESIGNER BOARD GAMES AND ENDED UP BUYING CARCASSONNE THEN NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR ONE OF MY FRIENDS BOUGHT BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL AND WE ENDED UP FORMING A REGULAR BOARD GAME GROUP AND I'VE BOUGHT A BUNCH OF GAMES SINCE THEN IN THE PAST MONTH ALONE I'VE BOUGHT

LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL
FURY OF DRACULA
WARHAMMER DISHWARES PLUS EXPANSIONS
JAMAICA
GHOST STORIES
TINY EPIC QUEST KICKSTARTER
SUSHI GO
CODENAMES

YEAH I THINK I NEED TO TONE IT DOWN A BIT
UNLIKE MY BROTHER I WASN'T A SPORTY KID MY PARENTS FOUND A GREAT WAY TO GET THE FAMILY TO SIT AROUND A TABLE TOGETHER WITHOUT THE TV AND IT WAS MOSTLY RISK AND SCRABBLE THEN CATAN AND CARCASSONNE

LATER MY COLLEGE HAD A GAME DESIGN PROGRAM WHICH HAPPENED TO HOUSE THEIR GAME LIBRARY IN MY BUILDING I WENT TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES BUT ENDED UP HANGING AROUND THE SHELF STACKED WITH EVERYTHING FROM KING OF TOKYO TO MAGE KNIGHT
PANDEMIC IF WE'RE TALKING GAMES I LOVED THE IDEA OF A CO-OPERATIVE GAME IT MOTIVATED ME TO GO TO A NEETUP WHERE I PLAYED THURN AND TAXIS

WHICH WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD

I KNEW OF PANDEMIC FROM TABLETOP AND DIDN'T GET TO ACTUALLY PLAY IT TILL MUCH LATER

I WAS IN A SPOKEN WORD POETRY GROUP FOUND OUT A COUPLE OF MY FRIENDS WERE ALWAYS LATE BECAUSE THEY PLAYED BOARD GAMES BEFOREHAND PASSING THROUGH THE FRONT HALLWAY ONE DAY THEY CALLED OUT THAT THEY NEEDED ONE MORE PLAYER FOR BETRAYAL I FIGURED THAT I SUCK AT CLUE BUT AT LEAST I'M A WARM BODY IT WAS THE SECRET ALIEN TRAITOR HAUNT AND IT WAS REALLY AMAZING WE WERE ALL PERFORMERS IN SOME CAPACITY MOST OF THEM WERE ALSO WAY INTO RAGS SO WE ALL GOT REALLY INTO IT AND HAD A LOAD OF FUN I HAD NO CLUE GAMES WERE FUN THEN WE PLAYED SMASH UP ALMOST KILLED IT FOR ME RIGHT THEN AND THERE BUT WENT BACK A FEW TIMES AND KEPT HAVING FUN WITH BETRAYAL AND HATING SMASH UP ABOUT A YEAR LATER I BOUGHT MY OWN BETRAYAL AND IT WAS AMAZING
WELCOME

I WAS JUST ON A BUYING SPREE AND NOW I AM LIKE WHOA I GOTTA STEP BACK AND COOL IT OFFICIAL

BUT WITH HOLIDAYS COMING UP THERE'S A LOT OF SALES AARRGGGH


I BOUGHT THE FOLLOWING OVER LAST TWO MONTHS

BLOOD RAGE

REIGN OF CTHULHU PANDEMIC

LEGENDS OF ANDOR

FIREFLY THE GAME

NATIONS

SUBURBIA

THE LORD OF ICE GARDEN

CASTLES OF MAD KING LUDWIG

TYRANTS OF UNDERMARK

ONE OF MAJOR CRITERIA FOR ME IS WHETHER IF A GAME CAN BE PLAYED SOLO SO I DON'T END UP HAVING BOARDGAMES COLLECTING DUST BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE WANT TO PLAY THEM THERE ARE FEW I'VE BOUGHT REGARDLESS ALTHOUGH BUT I THINK CATAN AND STAR TREK CATAN WILL BE MY ONLY THREE PLAYERS GAMES

EDIT OH I JUST REALIZED I NEVER ANSWERED THE MAIN QUESTION GROWING UP I LOVED BOARDGAMES BUT IT WAS MOSTLY STUFF LIKE CLUE MONOPOLY SCOTLAND YARD RISK AND SUCH MY DAD HAD WARGAMES FROM AVALON HILLS AND I ALWAYS DROOLED OVER THOSE BUT NOBODY WOULD PLAY WITH ME I WOUND UP PLAYING THEM MYSELF WHICH LED TO SEVERAL ODD EXPERIENCES BUT WHATEVER IN COLLEGE I FOUND A GROUP OF FRIENDS WHO USED TO PLAY RISK AND CASTLE RISK OR WAS IT EUROPE RISK CAN'T RECALL SO THAT WAS NICE BUT WE ALL EVENTUALLY MIGRATED TO RTS GAMES WARCRAFT AND STARCRAFT

BACK THEN IT WAS PRETTY MUCH NEVER HEARD OF TO FIND GAMES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE PERHAPS THEY DID EXIST BUT THIS WAS SO I DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO WEALTH OF INFORMATION WE CAN EASILY FIND ON INTERNET TODAY FEW YEARS AGO I HAPPENED UPON MAGE KNIGHT AND WAS SURPRISED IT COULD BE SOLOED SO IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE PURCHASE AT SAME TIME I DISCOVERED THERE'S FEW PEOPLE AT WORK WHO MET UP ONCE IN A WHILE TO PLAY GAME OF THRONES 2ND EDITION SO I JOINED THEM AND THE FUNNY THING IS I ENDED BEING THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED OTHER GAMES TO THEM SOME OF POPULAR ONES I INTRODUCED THEM WOULD BE LORDS OF WATERDEEP MEDIEVAL MASTERY SMALL WORLD AND STAR TREK CATAN FEDERATIONS MAPS
FOR ME IT WAS A FEW MONTHS AGO MY BUDDY HAD ME BUY TABLETOP SIMULATOR IN MY STATE OF IGNORANCE I SCOFFED AND SAID THAT I AM NOT PAYING GOOD MONEY TO PLAY CHINESE CHECKERS AND CHESS FAST FORWARD AND I FIND MYSELF NOW BUYING ANYTHING THAT LOOKS EVEN REMOTELY INTERESTING FROM MY LOCAL STORE AND AMAZON I HAVE BEEN LOVING RELIC AND CANNOT WAIT TO GET THE EXPANSIONS
I LIVE IN GERMANY SO PLAYING BOARD GAMES WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING ONE COULD DO WHAT MADE ME INTO A BOARD GAMER HOWEVER WAS WHEN I HAD AN INTERNSHIP IN BERLIN DIDN'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE AND WAS BORED SO I LOOKED AT NEETUP FOR SOMETHING TO DO AND THE ULTIMATE INTERNATIONAL BOARD GAME EXPERIENCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOUNDED INTERESTING ENOUGH ONLY MET TWICE A MONTH BUT PEOPLE AN EVENING SO WE HAD TO SPLIT INTO DIFFERENT TABLES AND ONE COULD PARTNER WITH OTHERS THAT ENJOYED SIMILAR GAMES AND LATER IN THE EVENING ONCE THE COUNT DROPPED BELOW WE WOULD JUST ALL GATHER FOR A FEW ROUNDS OF RESISTANCE GREAT WAY TO GET INTO THE HOBBY
I HAD RECONNECTED WITH A FRIEND I GREW UP WITH A COUPLE YEARS BACK HE INVITED MY WIFE AND I TO COME OVER FOR DINNER WITH HIM AND HIS PARTNER

AFTER DINNER THEY SUGGESTED A GAME AT THIS POINT MY ONLY MODERN GAME EXPERIENCE WAS CH AND I WAS SKEPTICAL THEY SET UP PANDEMIC AND I WAS HOOKED ACTUALLY HE AND I ARE GETTING READY TO START PANDEMIC LEGACY LATER THIS WEEK CANNOT WAIT
A COUPLE OF CHRISTMASES AGO SOME BOARD GAMING FRIENDS INVITED ME TO STAND IN FOR THEIR FOURTH REGULAR GUY PLAYED LOVE LETTER DUNGEON LORDS AND REX FINAL DAYS OF AN EMPIRE THAT WAS A LONG NIGHT BUT I HAD A BLAST

THEN MY DAUGHTER STARTED SEEING A COUNSELOR AND WE WERE RECOMMENDED TO START HAVING BOARD GAME NIGHTS AS A FAMILY

I MET A FEW MTG PLAYERS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL I GOT INTO THAT HOBBY AND WENT TO DRAFT GAMES WITH THEM QUITE REGULARLY THOSE GAMES TOOK PLACE IN THE LOCAL FRIENDLY GAMING STORE SO EVERY TIME I CAME THERE I SAW THE ROWS AND ROWS OF BOARDGAMES LINING THE WALLS I GOT CURIOUS ABOUT ONE OF THEM AND ASKED THE OWNER HOW YOU NEEDED TO PLAY IT AND HE EXPLAINED IT HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT EVERY WEDNESDAY WAS BOARDGAME NIGHT

I ENDED UP CHECKING IT OUT A FEW TIMES WITH SOME FRIENDS AND THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP LOVING BOARDGAMES
ACTUALLY I'VE LOVED BOARD GAMES MY WHOLE LIFE BUT DIDN'T GET INTO THE DESIGNER SCENE TIL RECENTLY WELL MORE INTO THE DESIGNER SCENE FIRST GAMES WERE MONOPOLY AND WAHOO PLAYED ALL THE BASIC GAMES AS A KID LIKE KERPLUNK TROUBLE SOME AMAZING FRANKENSTEIN GAME WHERE YOU TRYING TO WAKE UP HIS MONSTER BY FINDING PLASTIC PARTS AND STICKING THEM INTO HIM AND THEN PULLING A LEVER TO SEE IF YOU COULD WAKE HIM UP AND WIN PLEASE SOMEONE FIND THIS GAME BECAUSE IT WAS AMAZING AT LEAST THEMATICALLY AND THEN MY FIRST REAL ENTRY INTO DESIGNER GAMES WAS CARCASSONNE THAT MY FRIENDS DAD OWNED AND LOVED
WELL I WAS CHECKING JINJA DEALS ONE DAY AND THERE WAS A BIG SALE ON AMAZON ON BOARD GAMES SO I JUST CLICKED ON IT TO SEE WHAT GAMES WERE EVEN AVAILABLE I WAS EXPECTING THE STUFF THAT YOU ALREADY SEE AT WALMART AND TARGET THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE THINGS I HADN'T IMAGINED BEING GAMES SO I GO THROUGH READING ALL THE REVIEWS TRYING TO NARROW IT DOWN BECAUSE I THINK IF I BUY ONE GOOD GAME THAT WILL GIVE US SOMETHING TO DO THAT'S A NICE CHANGE OF PACE SO I'M NARROWING DOWN BY READING REVIEWS AND THEN I GET ON YOUTUBE TO HELP DECIDE BETWEEN THE FINAL OR ABOUT A MILLION ONE HOUR TOP TEN LISTS BY THE DICE TOWER LATER AND HERE WE ARE

NOW I JUST NEED MORE TIME AND MORE WARM BODIES TO PLAY BOARDGAMES WITH
IN COLLEGE ONE OF MY FRIENDS INTRODUCED US TO COSMIC ENCOUNTER WE PLAYED THAT OVER AND OVER THEN WE PLAYED CATAN AND DOMINION AND I WAS HOOKED IT HELPED THAT TABLETOP CAME OUT VERY SOON AFTER THAT YEAR SO I WAS ABLE TO WATCH A BUNCH OF COOL BOARD GAMES BEING PLAYED BY WIL WHEATON SPECIFICALLY SMALL WORLD WITH DAY BECAUSE I WAS A HUGE FOLLOWER OF HIM
TICKET TO RIDE FOLLOWED BY BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL

BEFORE PLAYING THEM I HAD INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT BOARD GAMES MEANT GAMES LIKE MONOPOLY SCRABBLE SNAKES AND LADDERS THEN MY COLLEGE MATE DECIDED TO HOST A BOARD GAME NIGHT AND I CRINGED AT THE THOUGHT BUT WENT ANYWAY

I THEN REALIZED THAT MY PERCEPTION OF BOARD GAMES WAS WRONG AND UPDATED AND THEY HAVE INDEED EVOLVED AND MODERNIZED TO AN AMAZING ENTERTAINMENT MEDIUM WHILE STILL RETAINING THEIR SOCIAL ASPECT

I HAVE SINCE THEN PROCEEDED TO GO ON A SPENDING SPREE AND NOW OWN A COLLECTION OF MY OWN
TO HOURS TO ELDRICH HORROR OUCH THE LONGEST GAME I'VE HAD WAS ABOUT HOURS AND THAT WAS MY FIRST GAME WHERE WE WERE LEARNING TO PLAY MOST OF THE TIME IT'S TO SOMETIMES LESS IF WE GET OUR BUTTS HANDED TO US BUT I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT WITH MORE THAN INVESTIGATORS AND DON'T THINK I EVER WOULD THAT COULD CAUSE IT TO GO ON THAT LONG
ABOUT WHAT GOT YOU INTO BOARD GAMES AND WHAT EXTENT YOUR COLLECTION IS WHEN IT STARTED TO GROW

PLAYED A FEW MODERN BOARD GAMES BEFORE REALLY GETTING INTO THE HOBBY THERE WERE A COUPLE OF HITS I ENJOYED FOR PARTIES BUT OVERALL NOTHING THAT BLEW ME AWAY AND I OUTRIGHT HATED A FEW I TRIED THEN I WAS GIFTED ZOMBICIDE AND MY MIND WAS BLOWN BY THE MERE CONCEPT THAT CO-OP BOARD GAMES EXISTED

I SOON ENDED UP ON THIS SUBREDDIT BECAUSE I WAS CURIOUS WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE OUT THERE WHICH GAVE ME AN IDEA OF SOME THINGS I'D LIKE TO TRY OUT WHEN THE BF AND I HEARD THAT A GAME STORE WE LIKED WAS STARTING UP BOARD GAME NIGHTS WE DECIDED TO GO WE GOT INTRODUCED TO MORE GAMES AND BEGAN TO GROW OUR COLLECTIONS WE SOON FOUND WE WERE NOT GETTING IN AS MUCH GAMING AS WE WANTED SO WE BEGAN HAVING OUR OWN MONTHLY GAMING EVENTS

GOING TO BE SOON YEARS SINCE THAT GIFT AND I PLAY GAMES AT LEAST THREE WEEKENDS A MONTH MY CURRENT COLLECTION HAS STEADILY GROWN A GREAT DEAL DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER SINCE BG LISTS SOME EXPANSIONS AS SEPARATE GAMES BUT IT IS OVER THE BF HAS AN A SIMILAR COLLECTION AS WELL AND OF COURSE I'VE PLAYED GAME THAT ARE IN NEITHER OF OUR COLLECTIONS

ABOUT THE GAMES I HAVE AND YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH THEM

TRURO WAS ONE OF MY GAME OBSESSION GAMES USED TO TAKE IT CARPING IT DOESN'T SEE MUCH PLAY ANYMORE BUT I LOVE IT FOR WHAT IT IS

GOT TAKENOKO DURING MY FIRST YEAR OF THE HOBBY I'VE PLAYED IT ONLINE WITH FRIENDS MORE THAN MY ACTUAL PHYSICAL COPY I REALLY LIKE THE EXPANSION FOR IT

GLOOM IS ALRIGHT I ENJOY IT WHEN I PLAY IT THE CARDS FOR IT ARE ONE OF THE COOLEST CARDS OUT THERE

WONDERS IS ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITE GAMES LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE IT BUT AFTER I GOT PAST FIGURING OUT HOW SCIENCE WORKED AND WHAT ALL THE ICONS MEANT THE GAME JUST FELT LIKE A BUNCH OF BUILD UP WITH NO PAYOFF WHEN IT COMES TO DRAFTING GAMES IN A SIMILAR VEIN I AM A MUCH BIGGER FAN OF AMONG THE STARS

ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE WORTH MENTIONING MY FRIEND HAS TRIBES AND THAT I LOVE IT A LOT

I'D RECOMMEND YOU FIRST TRY THE GAMES YOU HAVE COMING AND TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE GAMES THAT SHOW UP AT YOUR GAME GROUP WHEN YOU'RE FRESH INTO THE HOBBY EVERYTHING FEELS BRAND NEW AND AMAZING AND IT IS VERY EASY TO WANT TO BUY ALL THE SHINY THINGS BUT IT HELPS IN THE LONG RUN TO TRY AND RESTRAIN YOURSELF ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO BUYING THINGS ON A WHIM OR JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE HYPING ABOUT IT YOUR TASTE IN GAMES WILL REFINE AND CHANGE AS YOU TRY MORE THINGS BUYING A LOT OF GAMES EARLY ON WILL INCREASE THE CHANCES OF YOU HAVING BOXES THAT JUST COLLECT DUST ON A SHELF BECAUSE YOU EITHER GOT SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT A GOOD MATCH FOR YOU OR YOU'VE JUST MOVED ON FROM

OTHER THAN THAT HAVE FUN TRY AS MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AS YOU CAN AND IF YOU WANT TO BUY SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T TRIED PERSONALLY CHECK OUT SOME REVIEWS AND PLAY THROUGHS FOR IT ON YOUTUBE FIRST
I STARTED OUT WITH SIMILAR GATEWAY DRUGS GAMES THROUGH CHILDHOOD I HAD GROWN UP WITH MONOPOLY AND THE GAME OF LIFE

THEN ONE DAY SOMEONE INTRODUCED ME TO CATAN AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY WE STARTED PLAYING AT WORK ON OUR LUNCH BREAKS AND SOON I WAS INTRODUCED TO A WHOLE SLEW OF GAMES BOARD GAMES CARD GAMES DOMINION WAS ANOTHER GROUNDBREAKING GAMES FOR ME FROM THERE I STARTED EXPLORING MORE AND MORE GAMES

MY COLLECTION NOW IS A LITTLE LENGTHY TO LIST BUT WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THAT ONCE YOU'VE FOUND GAMES THAT ARE AT THE TOP OF THEIR CATEGORY GAMES THAT TAKE A MECHANIC AND POLISH IT TO ALMOST PERFECTION IT'S HARD TO WANT TO PULL OUT A GAME THAT FEELS SIMILAR BUT DOESN'T DO IT AS WELL
I'VE SEEN THE EXPANSIONS PRICED ANYWHERE FROM TO AN INSANE I'VE BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT MYSELF

I DID MANAGE TO GET A COPY OF THE BASE GAME AND FAME FORTUNE FOR SHIPPED ON EBAY RECENTLY WHICH IS A SCREAMING DEAL AS SUCH I HAVE AN EXTRA BASE GAME AVAILABLE NOW BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE EXPANSIONS ARE THE TOUGH ONES TO FIND AT A REASONABLE PRICE
I'VE SENT YOU A MESSAGE WITH SOME INFO
WHICH VERSION THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL AND I'M UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY VARIED A LOT
I'LL MESSAGE YOU THE LINKS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT SCALPERS TO BUY THEM

QUARTO IS A FANTASTIC BEAUTIFUL ON THE TABLE QUICK GAME FOR ALL AGES I HAD IT ON THE LIVING ROOM COFFEE TABLE FOR OUR LAST BIG PARTY AND GUESTS COULD SIT DOWN AND PLAY A FEW QUICK GAMES TO CHALLENGE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS IT IS A MUST HAVE GAME HIGHLY RECOMMEND

HOW DID THIS GO
WELL I STILL THINK IT SHOULD BE A BUT HEY DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT
THREE MINUTES TO GO SEVERAL INTERESTING NEW DONATION REWARDS THIS YEAR
I LOVE BOARD GAMES SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT A DIGITAL EXPERIENCE SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS ABSOLUTELY NO APPEAL TO ME WHATSOEVER IF I'M GOING TO PLAY A VIDEO GAME I ALREADY HAVE MY AND THAT CAN DO A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN JUST PLAY BOARD GAMES
2 THINGS

IF I'M DOING THINGS DIGITALLY AND HAVE SOMETHING THAT HANDLES THE BACK END PROCESSING THERE ARE BETTER GAME EXPERIENCES ONE CAN CREATE AS THE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS BOARDGAMES ARE STRUCTURED AS THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF PHYSICAL PIECES SO THE REAL POTENTIAL OF THIS IS DOING VIDEO GAMES IN WHICH CASE I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER SERVED TO FOCUS ON THAT INSTEAD OF INHERITING THE DESIGN LIMITATIONS OF A DIFFERENT MEDIUM

SECOND I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A DISCUSSION ON DIGITAL DELIVERY ALA PRINT ON DEMAND CROSSED WITH PNP AND I THOUGHT WELL NOW THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA HOLLANDSPIEL IS SORT OF DOING THAT WITH THEIR NEWEST GAME AN INFAMOUS TRAFFIC WITH ITS AVAILABILITY IN BOTH PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL KITS
THE MAIN REASON I HAVE BOARDGAMING AS A HOBBY IS TO BE SITTING AT THE TABLE WITH OTHERS I DON'T PERSONALLY SEE THE APPEAL OF DIGITAL BOARDGAMES UNLESS I WAS PLAYING WITH FRIENDS WHILST TALKING ON SKYPE FOR INSTANCE

IF NO ONES AROUND AND I WANT TO PLAY A GAME I'D BE REACHING FOR A DEDICATED COMPUTER GAME

BUT THAT'S JUST ME LIKELY THERE IS A MARKET THE CURRENT DIGITAL TABLETOP PLATFORMS SEEM TO BE POPULAR AND I'M SURE OFFICIAL IMPLEMENTATIONS WOULD GO DOWN WELL WITH THAT CROWD ANY IDEAS HOW BIG THAT AUDIENCE CURRENTLY IS
THE ADVANTAGES YOU STATE DON'T DO ANYTHING TO OFFSET THE ISSUES I HAVE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY IT LIKELY WOULDN'T LESSEN THE COST TO THE END USER IF YOU'RE STILL PURCHASING COMPONENTS AND COMPANIES NOW HAVE TO PROGRAM A DIGITAL IMPLEMENTATION THE COST WILL STAY THE SAME WITH THE ADDITION OF A BIG IPAD NOW

ALSO I LIKE THAT BOARD GAMES AREN'T TECHNOLOGICAL IF I WANT TO TAKE THEM SOMEWHERE I JUST PICK UP THE BOX I DON'T NEED POWER

WHY PEOPLE THINK THAT BOARD GAMERS WANT THEIR BOARD GAMES TO BE VIDEO GAMES IS BEYOND ME
WITH CD AND BLURRY I AGREE THEY'RE REPLACEABLE SINCE THEY HAVE TO BE PLAYED BY DIGITAL DEVICES ANYWAY BOARDGAME TO ME IS MORE ABOUT ANALOGUE EXPERIENCE BUT I CAN'T SEE WHY THEY CAN'T COEXIST

PAGE SOUTH A BETTER COMPARISON WOULD BE STH LIKE CD VS VINYL AND BOARDGAME VS DIGITISED BOARDGAME
I'M A BOARD GAMER AND I'D LOVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN EVENTUALLY THERE'S A HEAP OF STUDIOS WORKING ON SOME VERSION OF A DIGITAL BOARDGAME THE CURRENT INTERFACE IS TO USE A BIG TV AS THE CENTREPIECE SCREEN THAT RUNS THE GAME AND HAVE PRIVATE INFORMATION CONTROLLED BY A PLAYERS PHONE AND YOU SYNC UP VIA A WEBPAGE AND CODE

THE MAIN ISSUE WITH THAT IMPLEMENTATION IS YOU HAVE PEOPLE FACING A SCREEN RATHER THAN ACROSS A TABLE FROM EACH OTHER THE PLANTABLE LOOKS TO SOLVE THAT IT'S STILL EARLY DAYS AND INCH ISN'T HUGE MANY GAMEBOARDS ARE MUCH LARGER THAN THAT BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM AS THIS IS A FIRST MODEL I'M CERTAIN IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL AND ADOPTED THEY'LL OFFER MUCH LARGER ONES WITH FLATTER PROFILES

AS FOR EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T CARE FOR THIS THINK ABOUT HOW MANY POSTS WE GET HERE WHERE PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT NOT GETTING A GAME TO THE TABLE BECAUSE SETUP IS FIDDLY OR RULES EXPLANATIONS ARE COMPLEX OR THERE'S A LOT OF BOOK KEEPING OR SCORING TO BE DONE BETWEEN ROUNDS OR COMPLAINTS ABOUT DAMAGED COMPONENTS

THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SOLVE ALL OF THOSE ALSO AT GAMENIGHT I WOULDN'T NEED TO BRING A CAR BOOT FULL OF GAMES TO GIVE PEOPLE OPTIONS ONCE THE PLATFORM IS RELATIVELY MATURE I'D IMAGINE IT BEING LIKE STEAM NOT ONLY COULD YOU GET PEOPLE PLAYING YOUR GAME WITH CORRECT RULES ENFORCEMENT BUT YOU COULD ALSO GATHER DATA ON PLAYS AUTOMATICALLY LOGGING BG DATA AND ALSO GENERAL DATA ABOUT HOW OFTEN YOUR GAME IS PLAYED AVERAGE PLAY TIME RATINGS WIN RATES FOR CERTAIN CARDS AND STRATEGIES ETC

NOW IT DOES HAVE SOME DOWNSIDES OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST BEING THAT GETTING PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR PHONES OUT AND ON FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD OF TIME IS STILL A CHALLENGE FOR SMART PHONES BUT I SUSPECT THEY COULD JUST CHUCK A FEW CHARGING PORTS ON THE PLANTABLE AS WELL TO SOLVE THAT THE SECOND IS THAT IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON THEIR PHONES THEY ARE LIKELY TO GET DISTRACTED AND CHECK FACEBOOK AND MESSAGE PEOPLE ETC

I THINK I'LL ORDER ONE WHEN I CAN I'D LOVE TO SEE HOW IT WORKS AND I CAN DEFINITELY SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR IT TO BE REALLY GOOD
IMO I DON'T THINK THIS DEVICE IS GOING TO GO FAR THIS COME OUT A SOLID YEARS AGO AND MAYBE AT THAT POINT IT GRABBED THE INTEREST OF A TON OF NEW BOARD GAMERS GETTING INTO THE HOBBY BUT AS IT STANDS NOW PEOPLE ARE LOVING FUSSING ABOUT SIMPLE LITTLE APPS ON PHONES TO HAVE THEM GO DIGITAL IS QUITE A BIT OF A JUMP

BUT THE MAIN REASON WHY I THINK IT IS A BIT LATE IS BECAUSE VR IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER WE ARE ALREADY SEEING IT IMPLEMENTED IN GAMES LIKE MASK OF ANUBIS AND IT'S GETTING GREAT REVIEWS IT WOULDN'T SHOCK ME IF BOARD GAMES MADE A HUGE JUMP TO VR WITHIN THE NEXT OR SO YEARS TO TRULY BRIDGE THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN BOARD GAMES AND VIDEO GAMES LIKE CIVILIZATION
IT'S A COOL IDEA BUT I PREFER PHYSICAL BOARDGAMES TO DIGITAL

IN AN AGE WHERE YOU ARE BEING PUSHED TO UPGRADE ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS EVERY FEW YEARS I WONDER HOW LONG THIS TABLE WILL BE SUPPORTED FOR SOFTWARE UPDATES MY GUESS IS A NEW MODEL IS RELEASED EVERY YEAR AND ANYTHING OVER THREE YEARS OLD WILL BECOME A PIECE OF LEGACY ELECTRONICS

I WOULD RATHER GROW MY PHYSICAL GAME COLLECTION WHICH ONLY GETS UPDATES WHEN I DECIDE TO MAKE A CUSTOM INSERT ADD CUSTOM COMPONENTS OR THE LIKE RATHER THAN INVEST IN YET ANOTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICE WHICH WILL LIKELY AGE OUT OF RELEVANCE BEFORE THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
UNLESS WE'RE PLAYING IT WRONG I THINK YOU CAN ALSO SLOT OVER SOMETHING I EAST GET RID OF A BAD SLOT JUST BY PLAYING A DIFFERENT COLORED CARD ON TOP OF THAT SLOT MAYBE WRONG IT'S NOT COME UP MUCH SO IT HASN'T BEEN A BIG ISSUE

I LOVE THIS GAME IT'S SUCH A CHAOTIC BLAST I REALLY LIKE IT AT WITH TWO CHARACTERS EACH MAKES IT QUICK AND TIGHT WITH LOTS OF COOL MOVES TO MAKE
I CARE VERY LITTLE ABOUT CHROME BUT THAT UNBOXING WAS BREATHTAKING THE INSERTS HAVE BETTER GRAPHIC VISUAL AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGN THAN ALMOST ALL OTHER GAMES
I HAVE AGREED WITH HIM ON ALMOST EVERYTHING AND AS A RESULT AM TERRIFIED OF WATCHING THIS
YOU SHOULD TONE DOWN THAT GLASS BREAKING SOUND EFFECT BUT OTHERWISE NICE REVIEW
NOBODY HAS MENTION IF THE INSERT SUPPORTS SLEEVED CARDS ANYBODY KNOWS THIS
VINOS WOULD BE A HARD SELL FOR MY TABLE THESE DAYS THEY'RE STARTING THEIR STEADY AND INEVITABLE SLIDE TOWARDS LIGHT TO MEDIUM FARE RIP HEAVY EURO DAYS
I KEEP FINDING MYSELF INTERESTED IN VINOS AND VITICULTURE BECAUSE I JUST REALLY LIKE THE THEME HERE I GOT THE CHANCE TO TRY THE NEW ESSENTIAL EDITION OF VITICULTURE RECENTLY AND IT WAS QUITE GOOD BUT I'M STILL TORN ON WHETHER THAT PLUS TUSCANY EE OR VINOS DELUXE WOULD BE THE WAY TO GO CAN ANYONE COMPARE THE TWO I THINK SOME IN MY GROUP MIGHT BE TURNED OFF BY THE CARD DRAWS IN VITICULTURE BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE BIT ABOUT THE WINE FAIR ADDING EXCESS COMPLEXITY FOR THE SAKE OF BEING COMPLEX SOUNDS OFF-PUTTING AS WELL I LIKE A GOOD HEAVY GAME THOUGH AND SOMETIMES A MECHANICAL FEEL BOTHERS SU SD MORE THAN ME
THIS GAME LOOKS VERY INTERESTING BUT I FEEL I ONLY HAVE SPACE FOR A HEAVY EURO OR TWO HAVE FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE THE GREAT ZIMBABWE AND TERRA MYSTIC ALREADY IF I EXPECT THEM TO GET PLAYED


I'VE CONSIDERED ASHES HOWEVER THE DICE POOL FOR MANA SEEMS A BIT TOO RANDOMIZED

IT ISN'T YOU CHOOSE WHAT DICE TO INCLUDE AND ALL SIDES OF THE DICE ARE USEFUL ITS FAR FAR LESS RANDOM THAN HOPING YOU DRAW BASIC LAND


SO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG YOU MAGIC BUT NOT MAGIC YOU KNOW THE CG OR TCG ASPECT OF ANY GAME IS ENTIRELY UP TO YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE TOURNAMENT META YOU CAN JUST PLAY AND ENJOY THE GAME HOWEVER YOU WANT AND JUST PLAY WITH THE CARDS DECKS YOU HAVE

SO OR SO TAKE A LOOK AT SUMMONER WARS MASTER SET
NETRUNNER YOUR MANA POOL IS CREDITS WHICH YOU GET EITHER BY GIVING UP OTHER ACTIONS TO TAKE THEM OR BY PLAYING CARDS TO BUILD UP YOUR ACCOUNT EVERY TURN HAS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T PLAY CARDS YOU CAN USE YOUR ACTIONS TO DRAW OR GET MORE CREDITS
UM SEASONS IS BASICALLY EVERYTHING YOU ARE ASKING FOR MORE
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MAGE WARS YET MANA EXISTS AND DECK BUILDING EXISTS HOWEVER YOU ALSO POSSESS YOUR WHOLE DECK IN YOUR HAND IN THE FORM OF A LITERAL SPELL BOOK YOU FLIP THROUGH
I HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS GAME SO THIS IS A SHOT IN THE DARK BUT I HAVE HEARD CODEX DESCRIBED AS A GAME FOR FANS OF MAGIC THAT DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO HUNT DOWN RANDOM CARDS IN BOOSTER PACKS I WILL I COULD OFFER MORE INFO BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO IT
LOOK INTO CODEX
GOOGLE MTG POWER NINE CUBE CARD LIST FIND ONE YOU LIKE PLUG ALL THAT SHIT INTO A MTG COMPILER WEBSITE THAT SPITS OUT A MANY PAGE PDF OF ALL THOSE CARDS PRINTED OUT ACTUAL SIZE ON A GRID THEN TAKE THE PDF TO A MOM AND POP SMALL PRINTER SHOP HAVE THEM PRINT IT ON CARD STOCK IN HIGH DEF COLOR HAVE THEM CUT IT INTO CARDS WITH THEIR BIG ASS CUTTING PRESS TRIM THE CARDS AS NECESSARY WITH SCISSORS AND FINALLY SLEEVE ALL THE CARDS CONGRATULATIONS YOU NOW HAVE A MTG CUBE CONTAINING THE MOST FUN CARDS THERE EVER WERE TO DRAFT FROM WITH BUDDIES I PAID ABOUT CANADIAN FOR MINE QUALITY SLEEVES AREN'T CHEAP AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH IT

EDIT IF YOU REALLY LIKE MTG LIKE IT SOUNDS YOU DO NOTHING IN THIS THREAD IS GOING TO SCRATCH THAT ITCH THE SAME WAY MTG WOULD I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I'M THE SAME WAY TRUST ME ON THIS WHEN I SAY IT'S BEST TO JUST BITE THE BULLET AND INVEST INTO PRINTING OUT A POWER NINE CUBE IT IS FUN AS HELL
ALLEGIANCE HAS THE GOOD PLAY PART OF MAGIC IT'S QUITE INTERESTING WE PLAY IT AS A FILLER ALL THE TIME BUT IT HASN'T DRAFTING BUT IT MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING UP FOR YOU THOUGH
EPIC IS AN OPTION BUT YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW IT IF YOU HAVE PAYED STAR REALMS AND HERO REALMS YOU CAN PLAY EPIC IN CONSTRUCTED MODE OFFERING A DECK BUILDING EXPERIENCE
I OWNED ALLEGIANCE AND I WAS A MTG PLAYER FOR YEARS IT'S THE MOST SIMILAR GAME I'VE ENCOUNTERED TO MTG

YOU ALSO HAVE IMPERIAL SETTLERS
IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAY RACE FOR THE GALAXY IT CAN BE REALLY FUN TO DRAFT THERE IS A DRAFT VARIANT THAT HELPS YOU SPECIALIZE AND MAKE A DECK YOU GET YOUR MANA IN YOUR PLANETS YOU PLACE
AS YOU MENTIONED MTG CUBE

I WAS THE SAME AS YOU GAVE UP ON STANDARD AND DIDN'T WANT TO INVEST BIG BUCKS INTO A MODERN DECK I LIKE VARIETY AND WANT TO CHANGE MY DECK UP ALL THE TIME SO IT WOULD COST A BOMB SO I BUILT A CUBE AS YOU SAID I TEND TO GO TO ALL THE AND DRAFT REGULARLY ENOUGH AND THIS ALONE PROVIDES A DECENT AMOUNT OF CARDS TO DO A SMALL CUBE FOR EACH SET THAT I CAN DRAFT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
ARCTIC SCAVENGERS HANDS DOWN
THE SPOILS DECADE OF DECADENCE

DESIGNED FOR THE CUBE FORMAT WITH THE BEST CARDS OF THE DECADE
IT HAS DICE BUT STAR WARS DESTINY COMES OUT DEC AND LOOKS REALLY REALLY GOOD
PARTY CTHULHU GAME WHAT
I REALLY ENJOYED THIS VIDEO AMBIGUITY IS THE WINNER OF THE DAY
THIS IS A PRETTY LONG STANDING ANNOYANCE THAT HAS HIT MULTIPLE PRINT RUNS OF ALL THEIR EXPANSIONS IN VARIOUS WAYS I HAVE AN EARLY PRINT OF LOST LEGION THAT MOSTLY MATCHES BUT I'M MORE EXCEPTION THAN RULE THEY WILL POSSIBLY OFFER TO SEND YOU REPLACEMENT COMPONENTS IF YOU'RE LOUD ENOUGH BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL MATCH EITHER SORRY THERE
A SIMILAR THING HAPPENED WITH THE FIRST SET OF EXPANSIONS FOR THE PATHFINDER ADVENTURE CARD GAME AT SOME POINT THEY SWITCHED PRINTERS BUT KEPT THE PACKAGING VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL THE NEW CARDS CAN BE SPOTTED A MILE AWAY HETP AND THE CHANGE IN SIZE MEANS THEY CLUMP TOGETHER WHEN SHUFFLED

I HOPE WIZKIDS CAN DO SOMETHING TO HELP YOU OUT PAILOO WASN'T INTERESTED IN MY PROBLEMS WITH PATHFINDER
I THINK THE LESSON TO ALL IS DON'T SUPPORT COMPANIES THAT DO THIS I'VE STOPPED BUYING DOMINION AFTER THEY DID THIS A COUPLE OF EXPANSIONS AGO
YOU KNOW WHAT FUCK THIS GAME I'M GONNA SELL OR DONATE MY COPY OF THE CORE GAME AND MOVE ON

WIZ KIDS IS A TERRIBLE COMPANY
THAT SUCKS SO MUCH WIZ KIDS HAS BEEN A PRETTY CRAPPY COMPANY FOR A WHILE SO THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT MUCH SORRY TO HEAR DUDE
I LOVE MAGE KNIGHT FROM SOLO TO PLAYER I'VE PLAYED COUNTLESS TIMES AND I BOUGHT LOST LEGIONS A LONG TIME AGO AND LUCKILY THE COMPONENTS MOSTLY MATCHED

IN SAYING THAT I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A WIZKIDS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN BASED ON HOW TERRIBLE THEIR COMPONENT QUALITY WAS FOR THE GAME AND ITS EXPANSIONS
THEY WON'T REPLACE THE HEX TILES UNLESS THEY'RE MAJORITY JACKED UP BUT THE CARDS TOKENS THEY SHOULD REPLACE IF THE TECLA EXPANSION SPECIFICALLY THEY'LL REPLACE ALMOST ALL THE COMPONENTS YOU JUST GO TO THEIR WEBSITE FOR WIZKIDS PRODUCT REPLACEMENT AND PUT IN A TICKET FOR A REPLACEMENT FOR THE TECLA MANUAL AND THEY'LL INCLUDE THE OTHER COMPONENTS NOT HEX TILES THEY ONLY DO THIS UP TO DAYS FROM PURCHASE THOUGH
WHERE DID YOU ORDER IT FROM WONDERING IF I SHOULD TRY TO GET IT SOMEWHERE QUICK BEFORE THIS RUN REPLACES IT OR WAIT UNTIL A NEW ONE FIXES IT
I JUST BOUGHT LOST LEGION AND WAS HORRIFIED BY THE DISPARITY IN THE COLOR OF THE BROWN TOKENS AND ALL THE LAND TILES THEY ARE SO FAR OFFICIAL

MY CARD DECK HAD A LINE PRESSED INTO THE EDGE AS WELL MAKING THEM DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE CORE SET

I CONTACTED WIZKIDS AND THEY DID RESPOND SAYING THAT I COULD PUT IN A REPLACEMENT PACKAGE BUT THAT THE COLORS WERE WITHIN THE TOLERANCE

THIS RESPONSE SEEMED CONTRADICTORY BUT I'M GOING TO SUBMIT A PACKAGE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING TO SAY THE LEAST HOW CAN SO MANY COMPANIES GET THE EXPANSIONS SPOT ON FOR YEARS FROM THE BASE SET RELEASE AND WIZKIDS CAN'T SEEM TO GET CONSISTENCY IN BACK TO BACK PRINTS
I USED CLEAR FANTASY FLIGHT SLEEVES AND I DON'T NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE UNLESS I'M LOOKING FOR IT IN THE CARDS AS FOR REPLACEMENTS FROM THEM I WAS SUPER IMPRESSED THAT THEY SENT ME A NEW CARDS AND TOKENS FOR THE TECLA EXPANSION IT EVEN CAME WITH A FEW BONUS TOKENS
SO I APPRECIATE THE WARNING BUT IT'S NOT AS IF ANYONE HAS ANY CONTROL OVER SUCH THINGS

I THINK I'VE EVEN SEEN THAT THE ENCOUNTER DISCS ARE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SIZE

SO MY POINT BEING WE WOULD EITHER ACCEPT RISK AND ORDER ANYWAY OR DON'T ACCEPT RISK AND NOT ORDER

IF THE RISK IS ACCEPTED THEN WE GET THE EXPANSIONS THAT ARE FLAWED OR NOT AND IF FLAWED MIGHT BY CORRECTED BY WIZKIDS OR NOT

STILL UPDATES ARE WELCOME BEST OF LUCK WITH IT I'M IN THE MARKET FOR EXPANSIONS MYSELF I DON'T KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE IS FOR ME BECAUSE I MAY MAKE THE PNP DWARF CHARACTER SO I WILL ALSO HAVE ISSUES WITH CONSISTENCY
I GET BAD REQUEST INVALID HOME NAME WHEN I CLICK THE LINK
IS THERE ANY WAY TO PURCHASE THESE GAMES
LABYRINTH THE WAR ON TERROR AND THE COIN SERIES ARE GOOD HISTORICAL POLITICAL WAR GAMES IN THE SAME VEIN


CONGRATULATIONS I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO ALSO MEET SOMEONE AT MY NEETUP GROUP THIS YEAR WHO ENJOYS THESE TYPES OF GAMES AS WELL WE'VE REALLY ENJOY DAYS THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS WHICH IS SIMILAR TO TWILIGHT STRUGGLE BUT PLAYS IN A MUCH SHORTER TIME FRAME AND I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO TO OWN BOTH WE ALSO RECENTLY TRIED SEKIGAHARA AND WHILE IT'S NOT REALLY SIMILAR TO EITHER OF THE GAMES YOU MENTIONED WE BOTH REALLY ENJOYED OUT FIRST PLAY IT'S A BLOCK WAR GAME THAT USES CARD MANAGEMENT TO DICTATE THE BATTLES
IS GETTING A REPRINT SOON MADE THE CUT HTTPS
HANNIBAL ROME VS CARTHAGE WAR POLIS HELLENES HEARTS AND MINDS VIETNAM
IS REALLY WEAK IN COMPARISON TO TS AND SDV IN MY OPINION OF COURSE STICK W THOSE THERE'S STILL TONS MORE TO EXPLORE

FLYLICEPICK RECOMMENDED SOME SOLID ONES AS WELL POLIS IS A VERY INTERESTING GAME BUT IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET MUCH OUT OF IT BUT THE WAR EURO GAMEPLAY IS FANTASTIC
COIN CUBA LIBRE AND FALLING SKY ESPECIALLY

THEY AREN'T BEST WITH TWO PLAYERS BUT I STILL THINK THEY'RE GREAT IF YOU CAN GET FOUR PLAYERS FOR A GAME THE COIN SERIES IS PROBABLY THE BEST GAMING EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER HAD
THE COIN SERIES MIGHT DO IT OR MAYBE POLIS FIGHT FOR THE HEGEMONY IF YOU ARE INTO ANCIENTS AND OF COURSE THE TS LIKE OR THE UPCOMING IMPERIAL STRUGGLE MAYBE SOME OF THE MORE CLASSIC CDG LIKE WAR OR THE NEWLY REPRINTED AND EXTENDED LABYRINTH WAR ON TERROR IF YOU WANT SOMETHING PRESENT DAY THEMED
PATHS OF GLORY IS A 2 PLAYER VERSION OF AND ONE OF THE WAR GAMES OF ALL TIME
OH WOW THEY RELEASED IT I IT A FEW MONTHS AGO BECAUSE IT LOOKED COOL BUT HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO TRY IT YET
THE SECRET CABAL GUYS MENTIONED IT IN THEIR LATEST PODCAST SEEMED TO REALLY LIKE IT
I WAS INTERESTED IN IT SINCE IT SOUNDED NOVEL AND INTERESTING THE COMBINATION OF RIOT POLICE AND CARTOON CHARACTERS WAS A MAJOR TURNOFF AND I NEVER GOT A VERY GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THAT DECISION

I'D STILL LIKE TO PLAY IT BUT IT'S NOT ONE FOR ME TO BUY
I PLAYED IT LAST WEEK IT'S SORT OF A MIX OF PANDEMIC AND DEAD OF WINTER TO ME I'D DEFINITELY PLAY IT AGAIN AS WE PLAYED ON THE EASIEST DIFFICULTY WITH FULL COOPERATION SINCE WE WERE LEARNING WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANY DIFFICULTIES WINNING I AGREE MIGHT BE A BIT TOO MUCH I'D PROBABLY GRAB A COPY MYSELF AROUND
MORE DETAILS PLEASE VERY INTERESTED IN HOW I CAN USE THIS WHEN TEACHING SAMPLES
TOTALLY AGREE HERE I GIVE TECHNICAL PRESENTATIONS AND VIDEOS REGULARLY AND TEACHING BOARD GAMES HAS HELPED DEVELOP THOSE SKILLS AND VICE VERSA
THERE'S A WHOLE START WITH WHY THOUGHT THAT SUGGESTS GREAT LEADERS GO WHY HOW WHAT

SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
IT'S A BREAKDOWN OF THE POWER VALUES FOUND ON COMBAT CARDS
DAMNIT I WAS HOPING ON MACAO

FAMILY COPLAY FOR BONUS POINTS
HOW DID YOU GET INTO WARGAMING WHY DO YOU THINK THERE ISN'T A STRONG FEMALE POPULATION IN THE WARGAMING COMMUNITY
I NEVER SERVE FOOD AT GAME NIGHT BECAUSE I'M A CHEAP SKATE AND BELIEVE GAME NIGHT SHOULD BE A EXPENDITURE FOR ME AND MY FRIENDS I SERVE DRINKS BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DRINK

PLEASE USE YOUR STATION AS BOARD GAME CIVILIZATION MASTER TO CONVINCE EVERYONE SERVING FOOD IS WHACK AND TO TRY MY MANHATTANS AND TOGETHER WE'LL MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE THANK YOU
OH GOD PLEASE BUY SOME PROPER CTHULHU DICE BTW GREAT TEXT DO YOU WHEN PLAYING AH WE TRIED ONCE TO WHILE PLAYING ELDRITCH AND WAS GREAT
VERY NICE RETELLING MINOR RULES THING CLUE CAN'T SPAWN ON A GATE CONTAINING A LOCATION SO SISTER MIRACLE WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED ONLY WAY TO GET A CLUE TO HER IN THE BASE GAME WOULD BE TO HAVE SOMEONE GO TO HER LOCATION AND GIVE HER RESEARCH MATERIALS OR A BOOK SHE COULD READ FOR CLUES LIKE THE OLD JOURNAL THE RULES AREN'T THE CLEAREST EVERYONE WHO PLAYS AH GETS SOMETHING WRONG IN EACH OF THEIR FIRST DOZEN PLAYS
RACE OR AN UNOFFICIAL ROLL VARIANT OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL
I THINK IT'S WELL KNOW FOR BEING INSANELY DIFFICULT SO YOU'RE NOT ALONE
I'VE YET TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY PURSUE A CONSUME STRATEGY AGAINST THE ROBOT SINCE IT SEEMS TO ONLY INCREASE ITS ECONOMY
I REALLY HATE IT

IT PUNISHES YOU FOR WHAT SMOKES A NEWER PLAYER HEAVY PRODUCE CONSUME SPRATS EVEN IF YOU BUILD UP A BRILLIANT ENGINE IT'LL SPIT IN YOUR FACE

TO BE FAIR I CAN FULLY UNDERSTAND WHY LEHMAN WOULD WANT TO DO THAT IN ITS OWN WAY IT KIND OF FEELS LIKE AN ADMITTANCE OF YEAH THAT'S A PRETTY SOLID ASS WAY TO WIN MIGHT AS WELL MAKE THE SOLO PLAYER WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE BUT EVEN TO THAT EXTENT THOSE STRATEGIES HAVE NEVER TRANSLATED WELL TO HUMAN VS HUMAN PLAY
DUNGEON SOLITAIRE TOMB OF THE FOUR KINGS
STANDARD SOLITAIRE IS THE KING FOR A REASON
KNIERIM IS PRETTY DECENT IT CAN BE PLAYED SOLO OR WITH A PARTNER BUT IT COMES WITH LIKE EXPANSIONS AND IS OVERALL A NICE COMBINATION OF STRATEGY LUCK AND DECENT CHALLENGE THE EXPANSIONS ALSO ADD A NICE AMOUNT OF REPLACEABILITY ONE WARNING THOUGH THERE IS A LITERAL TON OF SHUFFLING
KEMPS IS GOOD FOR A GROUP OF FOUR

JAMES BOND IS GOOD FOR 2 PEOPLE

SPOONS WORKS FOR PEOPLE

SOLITAIRE IS GOOD FOR PLAYER

KNIERIM URBIAN AND SYLVIAN ARE MY RUNNER UP FRIDAY
HAVE YOU PLAYED LORDS OF WATERDEEP WITH THEM I THINK THATS A GOOD GAME THAT WORKS WELL WITH BEGINNERS NEAR TR ISH LEVEL ISH

YOU ALL MIGHT ENJOY CODENAMES THIS YEAR'S SPIEL DES JAURES GAME OF THE YEAR WINNER IT WORKS REALLY WELL WITH THE PLAYER COUNT LOTS OF FUN FOR EVERYONE

ANOTHER THING THAT WOULD WORK WELL FOR YOUR GROUP IS PANDEMIC A COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO ERADICATE DISEASES FROM A PLAGUE-RIDDEN WORLD THE BASE GAME PLAYS ONLY PLAYERS SO YOU'LL NEED THE ON THE BRINK EXPANSION TO ADD A 5TH PLAYER
BROOM SERVICE PLAYS UP TO AND HAS A GREAT BALANCE BETWEEN PLAYER INTERACTION AND STRATEGY I THINK IT'D ONLY BE SLIGHTLY HEAVIER THAN TR LOTS OF LAUGHER IT ALSO WON THE SPIEL DE JAURES LAST YEAR

HANSA TEUTONIA IS MY FAVORITE GAME AND IT PLAYS GREAT AT PLAYERS HAS A GOOD AMOUNT OF STRATEGY AND PLAYER INTERACTION CAN BE SLIGHTLY MEAN AT TIMES BUT BECAUSE OF THE RULES STRUCTURE IT'S NEVER BACK-BREAKING AND HAPPENS SO MUCH NO ONE CAN BE TRULY OFFENDED

CONCORDIA IS THE HEAVIEST OF THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IT'S NOT TOO BAD EITHER OUTSIDE OF THE BASIC RULES AFTER YOU EXPLAIN THE INITIAL STARTING HANDS YOU CAN BASICALLY START PLAYING

FABLED FRUITS IS A NEW ONE I ENJOY JUST CAME OUT EASY TO TEACH

SUSHI GO IS A CUTE AND DRAFTING GAME

SEVEN SAMURAI IS A SIMPLE YET CHALLENGING COOPERATIVE GAME FOR PLAYERS

HOKKAIDO IS A ZEN YET VERY CUTTHROAT SET COLLECTION GAME ABOUT COMPETING TO HAVE THE MOST FULFILLING VACATION
IN THE BEGINNING IT SAID GAMES UNDER THEN GOES WITH PANDEMIC EXPANSION TO DEAD OF WINTER AND SO ON ALSO PUTTING MONOPOLY ON THE LIST IS QUITE RISKY
AS A DIFFERENT LIST HERE ARE THE TOP GAMES CUSTOMERS HAVE ASKED AND WOULD BE OUR BIGGEST SELLERS IF I HAD ENOUGH OF THEM

CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY

EXPLODING KITTENS

DISTANT 5TH CODENAMES



I AM JUST SO GLAD A VLADA GAME GOT INTO THE MAINSTREAM IN MY AREA WE HAVE BEEN TRYING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SUBTLY SNEAK IT INTO MAINSTREAM SINCE YOU CAN'T TELL THE OTHER OF PEOPLE THAT CODENAMES MIGHT BE A GOOD GAME


ANYONE ELSE NOTICE SHE SAID CRABS AGAINST HUMIDITY BUT THE BOX SAYS CRABS ADJUST HUMIDITY
GOTTA LOVE THE TILT SHIFT LENS TO MAKE ALL THE GAMES LOOK SMALLER THAN THEY ACTUALLY ARE
CAN'T SPELL IGNORANCE WITHOUT IGN
IT'S A FAST SIMPLE GAME BUT VERY DEEP THAT PLAYS PLAYERS AND IT'S EXTREMELY GOOD ESPECIALLY WITH THE NO INVESTOR CARD VARIANT
IMPERIAL IS A FANTASTIC GAME ABOUT INVESTING AND MANAGING THOSE INVESTMENTS AND THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE WAR BONDS THAT ALLOW YOU TO CONTROL THE FIGHTING DURING WORLD WAR I YOU DON'T PLAY THE COUNTRIES YOU PLAY WAR PROFITEERS AND TAKE CONTROL OF THE COUNTRIES

IT'S SIMPLE TO LEARN BUT HAS A LOT OF DEPTH IN DECISIONS YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THE PHYSICAL SPACE OF THE MAP THE SHIFTING ALLIANCES OF A WAR THE SNEAKY PURCHASES OF STOCK AND THE TIMING OF INCOME AND PAYOUTS KEEPING IT ALL ORGANIZED IS A GREAT CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY WITH THE NO INVESTOR CARD VARIANT WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO KEEP A SHARP WATCH ON THE CASH RESERVES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES AND PLAYERS AND ISSUE BONDS AT THE PERFECT MOMENT

DEXTERITY GAME MEGA REVIEW BY ACTUALOL

HERE'S A REVIEW THAT COVERS LOTS OF GAMES

PERSONALLY I'D RECOMMEND FROM THE VIDEO

COCONUTS THERE'S ALSO AN EXPANSION TO GO UP TO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MILEAGE THIS'LL GET BUT I'VE PLAYED IT ABOUT TIMES OVER THE LAST MONTHS AND I'VE ENJOYED IT EVERYTIME

RIFF RAFF GIANT WOODEN PIRATE SHIP WOW ALSO HAS A NICE HAND MANAGEMENT ASPECT AND PREDICTING YOUR OPPONENTS CARDS LOTS OF TENSION

VIA FALETTI CHINKY DEXTERITY GAME BUILDING A TOWER USING PIECES FROM LOWER LEVELS OF THE TOWER LOTS OF TENSION MIGHT BE A BIT MUCH FOR A YEAR OLD

THESE ARE SOME OTHER GAMES THOUGH THEY MIGHT NOT WORK FOR THE KIDS OR JUST A SMALL GROUP

DIMENSION RACE TO STACK COLORED BALLS BASED ON RULE CARDS SEEMS EASY QUICKLY REALIZE HOW MANY RULES YOU HAVE BROKEN REALIZE YOU ARE TRASH

BRICK PARTY COMPETITIVE SPEED LEGO BUILDING DEXTERITY GOES UP TO SPLIT UP INTO TEAMS OF TWO ONE PERSON EXPLAINS HOW TO BUILD THE OTHER PERSON BUILDS THERE ARE RULE CARDS TO MAKE IT MORE INTERESTING I EAST BUILDER CANT USE THUMBS THE EXPLAINER CANT LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE VERY FUN GIVE IT A ROUND OR TWO AND MOST PEOPLE PICK IT UP

AND FINALLY GOD TIER GAME

LOOPING LOUIE THIS GAME REALLY HAS NO BUSINESS BEING SO GREAT BUT IT IS
YOU COULD TRY A MODIFIED RULESET FOR RAMPAGE AKA TERROR IN STEEPLE CITY
WONKY MIGHT BE ONE TO LOOK AT
DUNGEON FIGHTER IS A CHALLENGING AND VERY FUN COOP DEXTERITY GAME
OK OK OR CLICK CLACK OR BALING BALING WHATEVER VERSION YOU CAN FIND IS FUN BUT PROBABLY GOING TO GET OLD QUICK TOO I JUST BOUGHT CLICK CLACK LUMBERJACK LAST NIGHT AND IT'S GOOD TO PLAY ONCE OR TWICE SO LIKE MINUTES IT IS KINDA SIMILARISH TO JENA BUT FEELS SHORTER AND BETTER BECAUSE YOU GET TO SWING A TINY AXE

I HAVE FLICK EM UP AND IT HAS ACTUAL SCENARIOS IN THE BOOK TO PLAY THROUGH MY WIFE REALLY LIKES IT A LOT BUT OUR KID IS JUST TURNING AND TOO YOUNG FOR IT IT'S FUN

ICE COOL SEEMS THE SIMPLEST FASTEST TO SET UP AND IS NEXT ON MY LIST OF DEXTERITY GAMES TO BUY I LIKE THAT YOU CAN WORK ON TRICK SHOTS AND BUILD YOUR SKILL IN THE GAME
I DUNNO DUDE I THINK YOU HAVE THE BEST DEXTERITY GAMES THAT EXIST CROKINOLE IS PURE SKILL JUNK ART IS A BLAST OF VARIETY AND LAUGHS DEXTERITY GAMES YOUR PREFERRED GAMES TO PLAY W YOUR CHILDREN OR JUST WORKING ON EXPANDING THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT OF YOUR COLLECTION
THE DICE TOWER JUST POSTED A MINUTE VIDEO ON THIS TOPIC RECENTLY
DEFINITELY TOBAGO FROM BRUCE ALLEN IT CAME OUT YEARS AGO AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING HE EVER GOT PUBLISHED IT'S A VERY UNIQUE ENJOYABLE AND BEAUTIFUL GAME IF A LITTLE TOO LUCK DEPENDENT
STARTING WITH THE PREMISE THAT A HIT IS SOMETHING IN THE BALLPARK OF THE TOP ON BG AND THAT IT IS STUPID TO LABEL SOMEONE A ONE HIT WONDER ONLY A YEAR OR TWO AFTER THEIR HIT CAME OUT HERE ARE SOME DESIGNERS WITH A SINGLE TOP GAME RELEASED MULTIPLE YEARS AGO THAT HAVE NEVER HAD A HIT SINCE

WREDE CARCASSONNE

WILLIAM ANTIA CAELUS

US HOSTETTLER FICHU

JACQUES ARIOT GUILLAUME MONTAGE EMET

TED RACER PATHS OF GLORY

ANDREAS SEEDING HANSA TEUTONIA

ELIZABETH MAGIE

HER BOARD GAME AS IT STANDS TODAY MONOPOLY ORIGINALLY THE LANDLORD'S GAME MAY SUCK BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY WELL-KNOWN AND HER ONLY MAJOR GAME CREATION
YOU CAN'T GET MORE THAN KLAUS TEUBER EVERYONE HAS HEARD OF CATAN PRETTY SURE NOBODY KNOWS IF HE EVER DID ANYTHING ELSE
ENDEAVOR THAT GAME IS FANTASTIC BUT I DON'T THINK THE DESIGNERS HAVE DONE ANYTHING ELSE
KASPER AAGAARD WAS A ON MERCHANTS AND MARAUDERS HE'S DONE NOTHING SINCE NOT EVEN THE M M EXPANSION

HIS PARTNER ON THE GAME DID DO CLASH OF CULTURES BUT NOTHING NEW SINCE
DAVID WATTS CREATED THE CRAYON RAIL GENRE

FRANCIS GRESHAM DID ADVANCED CIV OH AND SPANISH MAIN I HAVE ACTUALLY PLAYED IT ONCE

HAROLD VANDERBILT BRIDGE IS CREDITED WITH NOTHING ELSE

ALLAN B CALHAMER JACQUES JOHAN MOGENDORFF SEEMS IN OLDEN TIMES GAME DESIGNER WAS LESS OF A PROFESSION AND GAMES WERE BUILT AROUND AN IDEA SOMEONE HAD


CRY HAVOC
MY EXPERIENCES

EBAY SLOWEST SELL UNLESS IT'S A HOT PRODUCT CLEANEST PROCESS CHANCE TO GET A GOOD PRICE EBAY TAKES A CUT

REDDIN FIRST PERSON WILL TELL YOU YOUR PRICE IS CRAZY AND LOWBALL THE SHIT OUT OF YOU SECOND PERSON IS REASONABLE IF YOUR PRICE IS REASONABLE PRETTY SELL RATE FOR HOT AND GAMES SHIPPING CAN BE A DEAL BREAKER TRY TO COMBINE GAMES GREAT FOR LOCAL TRANSACTIONS

BG ALL OVER SOME PEOPLE LOWBALL THE SHIT OUT OF YOU OTHERS WON'T OVERALL PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO GET MONEY BECAUSE GAMERS UNDERSTAND GAME VALUES SOME PEOPLE WANT PICTURES OF CONDITION AND THEN STILL COMPLAIN WHEN THEY GET IT VERIFIED ACCOUNTS MAKE IT EASY TO FIND SELLERS BUYERS WITH GOOD REPUTATIONS BG TAKES A CUT
LOCAL FACEBOOK TRADE GROUP I'M A UK WIDE ONE WHICH WORKS PRETTY WELL
CRAIGSLIST IS GOOD
I'VE ONLY USED THE REDDIN BOARD GAME BAZAAR TO SELL GAMES AND IT WORKS FINE FOR ME EACH MONTH YOU JUST POST YOUR LIST AND THEN JUST WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO MESSAGE YOU COULD TAKE A FEW HOURS OR A FEW MONTHS THEN YOU JUST COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GUY

OF COURSE THIS METHOD IS WAY BETTER IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO TRADE GAMES WHICH IS WHAT I PRIMARILY DO ALSO IT TAKES A WHILE SO IF YOU NEED MONEY ASAP THEN YOU MIGHT NEED TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE THOUGH I WOULD BET IF YOU POSTED YOUR GAMES AT A WICKED LOW COST PEOPLE WOULD SHOW INTEREST PRETTY QUICKLY ON THE BAZAAR
I'VE PICKED UP A USED GAME ON REDDIN IT WAS A GREAT DEAL WOULD BUY FROM REDDIN USER AGAIN ASSUMING I CAN ARRANGE SOMEONE TO PICKUP AVOIDING SHIPPING FEES
SELLING THAT MANY GAMES IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO ORDER A BUNCH OF REGIONAL RATE BOXES FROM THEY'RE FREE COME IN BUNDLES OF I THINK AND THEY'RE MUCH CHEAPER THAN FLAT RATE IN MANY CASES AND ALMOST ALWAYS AT LEAST A BIT CHEAPER IF YOU SHIP THROUGH PALPAL YOU CAN SAVE A COUPLE BUCKS TOO EVERY BIT YOU CAN SAVE ON SHIPPING IS MORE MONEY THAT CAN BE PAID FOR YOUR GAMES
EBAY IS PROBABLY FASTER ALSO POST ON R BOARDGAMEEXCHANGE
I LITERALLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU COULD SELL GAMES ON BG SO PROBABLY NOT NEARLY SO MANY BUYERS THERE ADD ON EBAY
IF YOU LIVE IN A DECENT SIZED CITY LOOK ON FACEBOOK TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY GROUPS FOR BUY SELL TRADE THOSE WORK THE BEST
I SELL ON AMAZON AND HAVE USED EBAY IN THE PAST AMAZON CHARGES A LITTLE MORE IN FEES BUT IT'S BETTER IF YOU WANT TO UNDERCUT AND SELL AT A FIXED PRICE IF YOUR WILLING TO RISK AN AUCTION FORMAT ON EBAY WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SELLING CLOSE TO WHAT YOU'D SELL FOR AT A FIXED RATE ON AMAZON THEN EBAY IS PREFERRED PERSONALLY I LIKE THE GUARANTEED FIXED SALE PRICE OF AMAZON VS THE WORRY OF SELLING ON EBAY FOR DIRT CHEAP AND PULLING IN LOW PROFIT DUE TO HIGH SHIPPING I JUST SOLD ROMA BY QUEEN GAMES SHIPPED USPS FROM KS TO NJ AND IT WAS FOR CHEAPEST AND ROMA IS A LIGHT WEIGHT GAME IMAGINE SELLING A HEFTY DECKBUILDER
FAGS IF THEY ALLOW YOU TO SELL EBAY BG REDDIN THIS IS MY TIER LIST
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE USED GAMES FOR SALE ON EBAY
I USE CRAIGSLIST I COULD PROBABLY GET A BIT MORE IF I SOLD GAMES ONLINE BUT I LIKE THE SIMPLICITY OF IT
I USE CRAIGSLIST AND ANOTHER SITE CALLED KIJIJI TO POST SALE ITEMS IT'S A GREAT WAY TO SELL BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH SHIPPING AND FEES

IN MY EXPERIENCE SHIPPING COSTS FROM CANADA ON LARGE AND OR HEAVY ITEMS LIKE BOARDGAMES KILLS THE SALE
DO YOU HAVE A LIST FOR WHAT YOU ARE PLANNING ON SELLING
NORMALLY I'D RECOMMEND LOCAL FOR BOARDGAMES AS DUE TO THEIR WEIGHT AND SIZE SHIPPING CAN BE A BIG SURPRISE IF YOU NEED TO DO BG MY FIRST CHOICE OF OTHER OPTIONS MAKE SURE TO FACTOR IN SHIPPING AND DON'T TAKE IT ALL ON YOURSELF
LOCAL IS ALWAYS BEST SPECIALLY BECAUSE EBAY TAKES AND YOU HAVE TO PRICE LOW ENOUGH TO BE INTERESTING AND COVER SHIPPING YOU GET WAY MORE MONEY OUT OF LOCAL HOWEVER THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT YOU GET LESS EXPOSURE AND YOUR GAMES MAY JUST SIT FOR A BIT
BG PICKS UP EBAY ORDERS YEA AND AUDIENCE IS LIMITED AUDIENCE IS NOT LIMITED SO LIST IT ON EBAY
I'D BE INTERESTED IN SEEING A LIST IF YOU HAVE SOME OF THE THINGS I'M LOOKING FOR I COULD MAYBE WORK SOMETHING OUT WITH YOU BEFORE I HAVE MY BIG STUDENT LOANS KICK IN ON ME
I'VE USED THE BG GEEK MARKET PRETTY EFFECTIVELY IT'S FAIRLY EASY TO SET UP AND YOU CAN FIRE AND FORGET EBAY WORKS AS WELL
HOW MUCH PLAY TESTING GOES INTO A GAME LIKE THIS ON AVERAGE HOW MANY ITERATIONS OF A GAME DO YOU GO THROUGH BEFORE YOU GET ALL OF THE MECHANICS DIALED IN
HEY I HAVE NOT PLAYED HOUNDED BUT IT LOOKS GREAT I LIKE THE GEOMETRIC LOOK OF THE GAME DID THAT FACTOR IN TO THE DESIGN OF THE STEEPLE OR DID THE THE DESIGN OF THE STEEPLE REQUIRE A MINIMALIST LOOK
DO YOU PLAY TEST WITH YOUR CATS DO THEY TRY TO CHEAT WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU PLAY TEST WITH YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER AND THEY CHEAT A BIT BECAUSE WE ARE ALL NEW AND LEARNING THE RULES

DO YOU GUYS LOOK AT GAME IDEAS SUBMITTED BY AMATEUR GAME MAKERS WHAT IS THE WORST GAME YOU HAVE SEEN
I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY HOUNDED AND I KNEW IT WAS MY KIND OF GAME RIGHT AWAY SO A BIG CONGRATULATIONS ON THE RELEASE

SHOULD YOU DESIGN FOR YOURSELF OR SHOULD YOU DESIGN FOR YOUR AUDIENCE

WHAT SIDE IS YOUR FAVORITE HOUND OR HUNTER AND WHY

WHAT GAME IS YOUR CURRENT OBSESSION

THANKS






I LOVED GLOOM AFTER I SAW IT ON TABLETOP

KYLA

ANY TALKS TO FEATURE ANOTHER ATLAS GAME ON TABLETOP

SO IF I WANT A JOB LIKE YOURS DO I NEED TO BE EXTREMELY LUCKY KNOW A GUY WHO HAS AN IN GET A GET A DEGREE IN SOME OBSCURE FIELD LIKE GAME DESIGN OR A PERFECT STORM OF ALL

CLINT

IS HOUNDED THE ONLY GAME YOU ARE WERE WORKING ON

HOW LONG AFTER YOU STARTED DID IT TAKE YOU TO GET TO WHERE IT IS NOW

ANY RANDOM ADVICE TO SOMEONE WHO HAS IDEAS OF GAME DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR HEAD BUT HAS NO IDEA WHERE TO START

BOTH

WHAT ARE SOME MECHANICS TO OTHER GAMES THAT YOU FIND THE MOST CREATIVE AND OR INTERESTING

HAS ANYONE REALLY BEEN FAR AS DECIDED TO USE EVEN GO WANT TO DO LOOK MORE LIKE

IF YOU COULD SET UP YOUR ULTIMATE GAMING SESSION AND PLAY A TABLETOP GAME WITH ANYONE IN THE HISTORY LIVING OR DEAD WHAT GAME WOULD YOU CHOOSE AND WHO WOULD YOU PLAY IT WITH

MOST WANTED THINGS ON YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST I NEED IDEAS


ARE YOU ABLE TO RESIST BITING INTO A TOOTSIEPOP
OOOH NOW THAT'S A GREAT THEME
I'VE FOUND THAT GROUPS THAT LIKE COUP USUALLY ENJOY SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM LOTS OF BLUFFING IN BOTH
SPLENDOR


SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM

I WOULD ALSO TRY PANDEMIC
IF RESISTANCE IS WORKING I THINK YOU COULD TRY DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG IT'S BEEN A HIT WITH MY GROUP PLAYS QUICKLY YET LEAVES YOU WITH A FEELING OF HAVING PLAYED A NICE FULL GAME AFTER EACH PLAY
ISTANBUL REALLY DOES SOUND LIKE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT I THINK IT'S A GREAT MEDIUM WEIGHT GAME WITH A DIFFERENT WIN CONDITION THAN USUAL FOR EUROS RACING TO GATHER RUBIES INSTEAD OF AMASSING AN MORE VICTORY POINTS

ALSO FIVE TRIBES IS A BOUT AN HOUR AS WELL I PERSONALLY LIKE ISTANBUL BETTER BECAUSE IT REWARDS LONG TERM PLANNING WHERE FIVE TRIBES IS MORE ABOUT REACTING TO THE MOVE YOUR OPPONENT JUST DID LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS ALSO POSSIBLY DOABLE IN AN HOUR IF PEOPLE DON'T DAWDLE

EDIT GRAMMAR
I LIKE KINGDOM BUILDER QUITE A BIT IT'S PRETTY AND CAN BE PLAYED VERY CASUALLY OR PRETTY COMPETITIVELY VARIABLE VICTORY CONDITIONS HELP REPLAYS STAY INTERESTING
I WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT ISLE OF SKYE INITIALLY I DISMISSED IT AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TOO SIMILAR TO CARCASSONNE I DON'T OWN VANILLA AARC BUT HAD PLAYED THE IOS VERSION SOMEWHAT AND WASN'T THAT TAKEN WITH IT I DID END UP BUYING STAR WARS AARC AS THAT WAS A BETTER FIT FOR ME

ISLE OF SKYE TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THOSE GEMS THE SELLING ROUND MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE FOR ME

EACH TURN EACH PLAYER PLACES TWO AREA TILES IN FRONT OF THEM AND SETS THE SELLING PRICE FOR THE TILES SETTING A HIGH PRICE IS GREAT BUT ONLY SO LONG AS SOMEONE ACTUALLY PAYS THE PRICE BECAUSE IF NO ONE OPTS TO BUY THEN THE SELLER MUST BUY THE TILES AT THE PRICE THEY PREVIOUSLY REQUESTED

IT'S A REALLY CLEVER INCLUSION THAT MAKES THIS GAME EVEN MORE INTERESTING WITH A LITTLE AGONISING OVER WHAT PRICE TO SET YOUR TILES AT

IT ALSO HAS LOTS OR DUE TO THE USE OF RANDOM SCORING TILES THIS MIXES THINGS UP AND EACH GAME IS DIFFERENT AND LEADS TO DIFFERENT TACTICS AND STRATEGIES PLAYS WITH IN MINS PRETTY PERFECT AS SOMETHING TO PLAY BEFORE THE MAIN GAME
I WOULD ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT CHICAGO EXPRESS AS A DEPARTURE FROM TICKET TO RIDE THIS IS A MORE BUSINESS ORIENTED GAME WHERE THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST MONEY WINS THIS IS A PURE STRATEGY GAME WITH NO LUCK IN AS MUCH AS IF PLAYERS WISHED TO PLAY TWO GAMES WITH THE SAME MOVES THE OUTCOME WOULD BE THE SAME ALSO

A SESSION OF CHICAGO EXPRESS IS PLAYED OVER A MAXIMUM OF ROUNDS IN EACH ROUND THE PLAYERS TAKE TURNS CHOOSING ONE OF THREE AVAILABLE ACTIONS AUCTIONING A SHARE OF ONE OF THE RAILROAD COMPANIES EXPANDING THE RAIL SYSTEM OF ONE OF THE RAILROAD COMPANIES DEVELOP ONE OF THE BOARDS HEXES OF EACH OF THOSE ACTIONS ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER IS AVAILABLE

AS SOON AS ALL AVAILABLE ACTIONS OF TWO OPTIONS ARE TAKEN A DIVIDEND PHASE IS EXECUTED WHERE ALL PLAYERS GAIN INCOME FROM THE RAILROAD COMPANIES THEY HAVE SHARES OF AFTER THIS DIVIDEND PHASE THE NUMBER OF ACTIONS IS RESET AND A NEW ROUND BEGINS PLAYS IN
MISSION RED PLANET THIS WAS THE FIRST GAME THAT CAME TO MIND IT'S AN ACTION SELECTION HAND MANAGEMENT TERRITORY CONTROL GAME ABOUT COLONIZING MARS AND COLLECTING MINERALS APS PLAYERS HAVE THE SAME CARDS THE STRATEGY IS IN WHAT ORDER YOU PLAY THEM AND WHERE YOU SEND YOUR GUYS PLAYS BEST WITH PLAYERS IF YOUR GROUP LIKES CONSTANT CONFLICT ROUNDS AND TURNS MAKES IT MUCH QUICKER THAN THE MINUTES IT SAYS ON BG I'D SAY FOR PLAYERS WHO KNOW HOW TO PLAY ONE OF MY FAVORITE GAMES

WONDERS I'VE ONLY PLAYED ONCE BUT IT WENT SUPER FAST AFTER WE GOT THROUGH THE RULES DRAFTING GAME WITH SIMULTANEOUS TURNS THERE'S PLENTY OF COVERAGE ON THIS GAME ONLINE THOUGH AND EVERYONE ELSE COULD PROBABLY SAY IT BETTER THAN I COULD

SMALL WORLD SIMPLE TERRITORY CONTROL GAME WITH TONS OF REPLAY VALUE IF YOU ENJOYED RISK AT ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE YOU'LL LIKE SMALL WORLD ONLY THING THAT SLOWS THIS GAME DOWN AND MIGHT MAKE IT PUSH THAT TIME LIMIT IS HAVING TO CHECK THE REFERENCE SHEETS THAT GOES AWAY AFTER ABOUT OR PLAYS

ALHAMBRA GRANADA THE SIMPLEST OF ALL OF THESE AND ALMOST AS FAST AS WONDERS SUPER SIMPLE TILE LAYING CITY GAME THIS IS ANOTHER WITH PLENTY OF VIDEOS ONLINE THAT COULD SUM IT UP BETTER THAN I CAN

FIRE AXE THIS ONE CAN GO LONGER THAN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT STILL WORTH MENTIONING LOOK IT UP IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HARD MINUTE LIMIT

EDIT FORMATTING
I REALLY LIKE ISTANBUL A LOT BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT SETTING UP CAN GET ANNOYING THERE ARE MANY ELEMENTS THAT NEED TO BE FIDDLED WITH AND SORTED ISLE OF SKYE IS A MUCH BETTER OPTION IMO
EDIT

MISREAD THAT TILE SOMEHOW HAHA

I WOULD SAY INDIGO CASTLES OF BURGUNDY BROOM SERVICE ABC
HONESTLY IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN FOR MEGA MAN I'D WAIT FOR THAT AND SEE IF YOU EVEN LIKE IT ENOUGH TO GO IN ON THE SETS PERSONALLY I LOVE MEGA MAN BUT PRETTY SURE I WILL BE PASSING ON THE KS AS I OWN AND IT SIMPLY FELL FLAT FOR MY WIFE AND I THAT IS NOT TO SAY IT IS A BAD GAME IT IS CERTAINLY INTERESTING BUT KNOW THAT IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE

AS FOR THE SALE PT IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND BARRING SOME PROMOS IT IS PRETTY EASY TO GET YOUR HANDS ON BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET YOUR FEET WET OR DELUXE IS AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY TO START
MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE THE DELUXE COPY ADMITTEDLY I DON'T OWN IT BUT I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS OTHER THAN THAT YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH PICKING UP THE FIRST SET I HAVE 2 BUT IS PLENTY TO GET YOU STARTED
I HAVE AND I RECOMMEND GOING WITH FIRST AS FAR AS I KNOW DELUXE IS GOOD FOR AN INTRODUCTION TOO

THE POINT IS THE GAME WAS THROWING INFORMATION AT YOUR FACE FROM THE VERY FIRST SET AND THE ONES AFTER THAT ADDED EVEN MORE RULES SO OR DELUXE WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATION
I GOT DELUXE ON AMAZON FOR HAVEN'T PLAYED YET BUT IT'S WORTH WATCHING THEM FOR THE PRICE
I GOT PIXEL TACTICS DELUXE VIA THE KICKSTARTER AND ENDED UP WITH PIXEL TACTICS AS A BONUS IT'S DEFINITELY A GAME THAT CAN GET OVERWHELMING WITH POSSIBILITIES SO STICK WITH DELUXE OR FOR YOUR FIRST SET THEY ARE STILL DEEP WITH POSSIBILITY BUT FAR MORE DIGESTIBLE WHICH MEANS THEY WILL HIT YOUR TABLE MORE OFTEN
FABLED FRUIT IS A GREAT LIGHT GATEWAY FAMILY WEIGHT WORKER PLACEMENT GAME WITH RECIPE FILLING IT PLAYS AND SHOULD BE PLAYABLE BY ANYONE MY KIDS ARE AND ALL PICKED IT UP VERY QUICKLY

I CAN'T REALLY COMPARE IT TO ANOTHER CARD GAME THE GAME AS A HEALTHY DOSE OF INTERACTIVITY HAS SOME PRESS YOUR LUCK AS WELL AS MORE TRADITIONAL PLACE YOUR WORKER GET A REWARD KINDS OF ACTIONS

THE FABLED MECHANIC KEEPS THE GAME REALLY FRESH AND I CAN IMAGINE HAVING NO ISSUE RESETTING AND STARTING FROM SCRATCH ONCE WE GET THROUGH THE DECKS

THIS IS A GREAT GAME FOR FAMILIES FOR CASUAL GAMERS FOR ANY GAMER WHO WANTS A LIGHTER QUICKER GAME FOR A GAME NIGHT IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL SO IT WILL TRAVEL WELL ESPECIALLY IF YOU FORGO THE BOX MAKING IT GREAT FOR VACATIONS WORK ETC

I AM A BIG EURO GAMER AND ENJOY EVERYTHING FROM WORLDS FAIR UP TO THE ALLERGIST AND VINOS THIS GAME IS GOING TO GET A LOT OF PLAYS AT OUR HOUSE


SO I WAS WATCHING THE DRIVE THRU REVIEW OF THIS ONE AND I WAS JUST WONDERING WHERE IT LEADS ON THE SURFACE IT JUST FEELS LIKE CAELUS PLAYED OUT OVER TURNS DOES THE EVOLVING CARD OPTIONS REALLY MAKE THAT BIG OF A DEAL HOW IS THIS BETTER THAN JUST USING A RANDOMIZER AT THE START OF EACH GAME

IF THIS SOUNDS NEGATIVE I DON'T MEAN TO BE I GENUINELY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS SUPERIOR TO RANDOM SET UP
I'LL BE THE DISSENTING VOICE I PLAYED FABLED FRUIT AT ESSEN AND LIKED IT WELL ENOUGH PLAYED IT AGAIN UNTIL I BELIEVE A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND IT FELL COMPLETELY FLAT FOR ME AND MY GROUP NOW ADMITTEDLY WE WERE ALL GAMERS AND PROBABLY ARE NOT THE TARGET AUDIENCE BUT WHEN WE PLAYED IT FELT VERY MECHANICAL AND KIND OF SOULLESS I NEVER HAD THE FEELING THAT I WAS MAKING INTERESTING CHOICES AND INDIVIDUAL GAMES WERE OVER SO QUICK THAT IT OFTEN CAME DOWN TO LUCK OF THE DRAW RANDOM TURN ORDER WHO WON EVEN WHEN THERE WAS SOME TAKE THAT IT JUST FELT EMOTIONLESS TO ME I PERSONALLY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN CHECK GET OUT THE OTHER CARDS BUT HONESTLY IF I JUST READ THROUGH THEM ONCE NOT PLAYING THEM IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAMPER MY ENJOYMENT AT ALL
IN CANADA THIS GAME COSTS DOLLARS
BUT REALLY THIS GAME IS JUST A LOT OF CARDS RIGHT LOL

I DO WANT THIS GAME
FOR THOSE THAT HAVE PLAYED HOW WOULD THE GAME WORK WITH SIX PLAYERS UTILIZING THE START PLAYER MARKER FOR AN ADDITIONAL PLAYER WOULD THAT BREAK SOME OF THE CARD ABILITIES
STATUS ON FFA SITE IS AWAITING REPRINT WHICH MEANS

THIS PRODUCT IS CURRENTLY OUT OF STOCK AT FFA WE ARE PLANNING TO REPRINT THIS TITLE BUT A DATE FOR ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION HAS NOT YET BEEN SET
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF IS GOING OUT OF PRINT FOR GOOD OR SOMETHING

THE CORE SET JUST HAD A NEW PRINT RUN RELEASED IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS SO IT'S NOT DEAD

PRODUCTION QUEUE IS MASSIVE AS THEY HAVE SEVERAL LINES OF PRODUCTS WITH MULTIPLE GAMES EACH WITH A CONSTANT FLOW OF NEW EXPANSIONS REPRINTS ARE REALLY LOW ON THEIR LIST OF PRIORITIES COMPARED TO PUMPING OUT NEW STARS WARS MINIS AND MARKHAM GAMES
IT'S OUT OF PRINT AND IN HIGH DEMAND AFTER THEY REPRINTED THE BASE GAME SET AS IT FIXES ADDS A LOT OF ASPECTS OF THE GAME IT'S A PHENOMENAL GAME BUT THE SHATTERED EMPIRES EXPANSION MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER SO MOST PEOPLE BUYING TI ARE GOING TO WANT SHATTERED EMPIRES

SHARDS OF THE THRONE DOESN'T HAVE THE REQUISITE STATUS THAT SHATTERED EMPIRE SO I'D HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT'S WHY IT ISN'T HARD TO FIND LIKE SHATTERED EMPIRE
PRODUCTS

ONE COPY HERE
I RECENTLY SNAGGED A COPY ON FOR A REALLY GOOD PRICE I THINK THEY WERE LOW ON STOCK WHEN I GOT MINE BUT IT'S WORTH CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY LEFT
OUT OF THE TWO EXPANSIONS AVAILABLE THIS IS THE ONE THAT DOES THE MOST TO REMEDY THE BASE SHORTCOMINGS NAMELY THE REMOVAL OF THE VP TILE WHICH IS SILLY BUT IT'S THE PREFERRED EXPANSION BY FAR
I HAVE GAME SHATTERED EMPIRE EXP BUT CAN'T FIND SHARDS OF THE THRONE EXP AUSTRALIA HAVE SOME COPIES BUT THEY DON'T DO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING TO EUROPE ALSO AMAZON HAVE SOME COPIES FOR SHARDS ISN'T ADD MUCH VITAL STUFF TO THE GAME BUT IT'S S STUFF SO
GIVEN THE GAMES YOU'VE MENTIONED I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR PLAYERCOUNT AND WELL WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN GAMES

IN MY EXPERIENCE THE SD GAMES ARE MOST FUN WITH MORE THAN TWO PLAYERS LEGENDS TACKS ON A CO-OP MODE AND CAMPAIGN AND A BUNCH OF OTHER STUFF SO YOU CAN PLAY IT SOLO OR TWO PLAYERS BUT I'VE ENJOYED IT MORE WITH THREE OR FOUR PLAYERS ALSO THE SD STUFF WILL HAVE YOU WANTING TO PAINT THEM THE MODELS LOOK GREAT BUT HAVING A PILE OF MONOCOLORED PLASTIC OUT THERE WILL LOOK BLAND GAMEPLAY IS A VERY LIGHT RPG ESSENTIALLY LOOKING AT GAUNTLET IN FORM

ON THE OTHER HAND BATTLEDORE AND CLAUSTROPHOBIA ARE BOTH STRICTLY 2 PLAYER VERSUS AFFAIRS CLAUSTROPHOBIA WILL ACTUALLY BE CLOSE TO 2 PLAYER VERSUS SD BUT WON'T HAVE THE CO-OP OPTIONS THEY'RE ALSO VERY DIFFERENT GAMES ONE IS A RELATIVELY EVENLY MATCHED STRATEGY BATTLE GAME AND THE OTHER IS A DUNGEON CRAWL

ALL THREE ARE GOOD GAMES SO IT'S HARD TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT CALL WITHOUT KNOWING MORE ABOUT YOUR SITUATION

IF YOU PLAY A LOT OF RAGS THEN THE SD FIGURES MAY FIND THEMSELVES BEING USED FOR YOUR VARIOUS RPG CAMPAIGNS IF YOU WERE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO PAINTING THEM THEN THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER REASON TO GO FOR SD IF YOU EVER PLAN ON HAVING OR MORE PLAYERS THEN IT'S THE ONLY OPTION FROM ALL OF THEM PRESENTED ABOVE

IF YOU ONLY HAVE TWO PLAYERS THOUGH THEN THE LATTER DEAL WOULD LIKELY BE THE BETTER OPTION YOU WOULD HAVE MORE GAMEPLAY VARIETY WITH TWO DIFFERENT GAMES AND BOTH WOULD BE THINGS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PLAYER COUNT PLUS BOTH OF THEM HAVE SOME MINIATURES THAT WHILE THEY WOULD LOOK NICE PAINTED DON'T SEEM TO NEED IT QUITE AS MUCH

ON A PERSONAL NOTE I'LL ADD THAT WHILE I OWN EVERYTHING IT'S NOT A GAME THAT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF DEMAND TO GET BACK TO THE TABLE THE OPINIONS ABOVE ARE BASED SOLELY ON SD AND SD FORGOTTEN KING WE'RE WAITING ON THE CAMPAIGN MODE FOR LEGENDS TO ACTUALLY START PLAYING IT AGAIN AS I HOPE THAT INTEREST IN IT
ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT SD LEGENDS IS DELAYED UNTIL SPRING AT THE EARLIEST DEPENDING WHEN THEY FINISH UP AND GET THINGS IN PRODUCTION THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT ITS GOING TO BE DELAYED FURTHER BY THE NE WHEN ALL THE FACTORIES SHUT DOWN FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY ADD IN SHIPPING TIMES AFTER EVERYTHING IS COMPLETED I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF IT WAS CLOSER TO MID SUMMER BEFORE IT IS RELEASED
I BELIEVE THE CORRECT ANSWER IS GO
CONCORDIA HAS A SINGLE PAGE RULEBOOK ADD IN ALL THE EXPANSION MAPS AND YOU'VE GOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF

BATTLETOWN HAS A HUGE RULEBOOK BUT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMPLE ESPECIALLY IF DONE PROGRESSIVELY AS SUGGESTED LOTS OF FIGHTERS AND LOTS OF STRATEGY
HIVE EASILY COMPARED TO CHESS WHICH WE ALL KNOW FITS THIS BILL TO A T
ARBORETUM
HEY OTHELLO
I PLAYED FIVE TRIBES TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME I CAN'T SAY IT IS DIFFICULT TO MASTER YET BUT I THINK IT WILL BE THERE'S SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK OVER A REALLY GOOD MOVE
I DUNNO BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA FOR A DICE TOWER TOP LIST
ANIS IS A NEW GAME THAT HAS VERY SIMPLE RULES BUT AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF VARIETY AND DEPTH DUE TO THE DIFFERENT LOCATION CARD COMBINATIONS HIGHLY RECOMMEND
GO IS OBVIOUSLY THE BEST ANSWER IT'S ABSURDLY SIMPLE RULES BUT TAKES AT TONS OF DEDICATED PRACTICE TO MASTER

AS FOR MODERN BOARD GAMES I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT HOW HIGH THE SKILL CEILING GOES MOST GAMES HAVE A LOGARITHMIC SKILL CURVE WHERE YOU IMPROVE QUICKLY EARLY ON AND THEN COULD EASILY SPEND YEARS REFINING YOUR PLAY TO A HIGH LEVEL

DOMINION IS AN ESPECIALLY SIMPLE EXAMPLE THE RULES CAN BE EXPLAINED IN PROBABLY SENTENCES BUT HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS WILL WIN BASICALLY OF THE GAMES AGAINST MEDIOCRE PLAYERS
DOMINION AND WONDERS COME TO MIND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE TO LEARN WHAT ALL THE CARDS AND STUFF DO AND ITS PRETTY EASY TO PICK A STRATEGY INVOLVING ONE WAY TO SCORE POINTS


THEY BOTH GET REALLY COMPLEX WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO CHUG ALONG MULTIPLE VICTORY CONDITIONS
HIVE THE CLOSEST TO CHESS THAT I'VE FELT WITH MODERN BOARDGAMES
TWILIGHT STRUGGLE
LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID GO OR CHESS WHICH ARE PROBABLY ACCURATE AS FAR AS TRADITIONAL GAMES GO I'D CALL THEM SORT OF LIFESTYLE GAMES BECAUSE YOU CAN PLAY THEM FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND CONTINUALLY LEARN AND GROW IN THE GAME PERSONALLY I SEE CHESS AS VERY ALGORITHMIC AND NOT ALL THAT INTERESTING BUT TASTES VARY

DEPENDING ON HOW STRICT YOU ARE WITH THE SIMPLE TO LEARN PART THERE ARE ALSO MANY CARD GAMES LIKE THIS POKER CAN BE THIS WAY BUT SINCE IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT LYING I'M NOT THAT INTERESTED BRIDGE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF BEING THE GAME FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE I GREW UP WITH MY PARENTS PLAYING PINOCHLE AND I LEARNED EUCHRE WHICH HAVE SIMILAR PROPERTIES IF YOU CAN FIND A GROUP TO PLAY WITH THERE'S NO END TO SUCH GAMES

FOR A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CARD GAME I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR FICHU THE GAMEPLAY IS MORE COMPLEX THAN SAY HEARTS BUT NOT OVERLY SO AFTER PLAYING A SINGLE HAND YOU'LL BASICALLY KNOW HOW TO PLAY BUT PLAYING WELL TAKES A WHILE CARDS SO THERE'S RANDOMNESS BUT CONSISTENTLY PLAYING EACH HAND WELL TAKES A LOT
FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MIND WAS TICKET TO RIDE

POSSIBLE ACTIONS ARE VERY SIMPLE SCORING ONLY COMES FROM THREE SIMPLE THINGS TIMING AND CONCEALING YOUR INTENTIONS AGAINST REALLY GOOD PLAYERS WHO KNOW ALL THE ROUTES AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO BLOCK GETS REALLY COMPLEX
SPLENDOR IT'S A VERY EASY TO LEARN TABLETOP CARD GAME BUT CAN BECOME EXTREMELY COMPLEX ONCE YOU START PAYING ATTENTION TO ALL OTHER PLAYER'S STRATEGY START MISDIRECTING OTHERS ETC GREAT BUY FOR A BEGINNER IMO
BATTLETOWN ANY ITERATION MAIN ENTRIES BEING DEVASTATION OF INDENES AND WAR OF INDENES

IT'S A STRATEGY BOARD GAME THAT EMULATES FIGHTING GAMES AND AS A FAN OF FIGHTING GAMES IT EMULATES IT SPECTACULARLY THE BOARD IS USED AS THE 2D STAGE WITH WALLS CORNERS STANDARD GAME MODE FEATURES TWO PLAYERS EACH USING UNIQUE CHARACTERS WITH DIFFERENT PASSIVE ABILITIES AND SIGNATURE STYLES STYLES MODIFY COMMON BASE ATTACKS THAT BOTH PLAYERS HAVE THE MAIN PREMISE IS TWO OUT FIGHT THE OTHER GUY AND EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION NOTHING IS HIDDEN

ASIDE FROM THAT THERE ARE TON OF DIFFERENT MODES AND WAYS TO PLAY IN A SINGLE BOX BOSS MODE TEAM FIGHTS DUNGEON CRAWLING AND EVEN MODIFICATIONS TO REGULAR PLAY WITH POWERED UP CHARACTERS AND ATTACKS

OVERALL I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT AND A PRIME EXAMPLE OF SIMPLE TO GRASP AND DIFFICULT TO MASTER I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS OUT GO MORE IN DEPTH INTO IT FOR ANYONE INTERESTED
CHESS
HANAFI IT'S A RELATIVELY QUICK COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE THE PLAYERS TRY TO PRODUCE THE MOST SPECTACULAR FIREWORKS SHOW REPRESENTED BY A SCORE FROM THE RULES ARE PRETTY SIMPLE A PLAYER HAS ONLY THREE POSSIBLE ACTIONS ON THEIR TURN BUT SCORING WELL TAKES A LOT OF STRATEGY AND THOUGHT MY GROUP HAS BEEN PLAYING THE GAME FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW AND WE ONLY JUST GOT OUR FIRST PERFECT LAST WEEKEND
THERE ARE ACTUALLY A LOT OF GAMES OUT THERE LIKE THIS IN DIFFERENT GENRES WHAT OTHER THINGS DO YOU ENJOY ABOUT GAMES THAT COULD HELP NARROW THINGS DOWN
R BOARDGAMES COMMENTS
CHESS SERIOUSLY THIS HAS BEEN MY HOBBY AND ADDICTION LATELY SO MUCH TO THIS GAME IT'S AMAZING
BATTLE LINE FOR ME IS THE DEFINITION OF SIMPLE TO LEARN DIFFICULT TO MASTER OTHER THAN GO OF COURSE COME TO THINK OF IT ALL OF KNIZIAS CLASSICS QUALIFY
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT TWILIGHT STRUGGLE WAS THE POSTER CHILD FOR THAT BESIDES THE OBVIOUS ONES LIKE CHESS AND SUCH THERE ARE LIKE FOUR THINGS YOU CAN DO EACH TURN BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHERE YOU WANT TO DO IT AND WHICH CARD YOU WANT TO USE
MANY WOULD DISAGREE WITH ME BUT I'M GONNA RECOMMEND RACE FOR THE GALAXY IT MAY TAKE A BIT TO GET USED TO BUT I FEEL THE STRUCTURE IS REALLY ELEGANT AND IT'S GOT A GREAT THEME EACH GAME FEELS LIKE A STORY

IT'S GOT A HIGH SKILL CEILING AND IT'S BEST WITH 2 PLAYERS IT'S MY FLAIR FOR A REASON
I THINK PUERTO RICO IS A PRETTY CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THIS AS IT INVOLVES A LOT OF TIGHT TACTICS TO GET THE UPPER HAND ON YOUR OPPONENT'S BUT IS STILL FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO PICKUP
I'M A BIG FAN OF ANTIAE DUELLUM WHERE THERE ARE THREE ACTIONS TO GAIN RESOURCES THREE ACTIONS TO SPEND THEM ONE ACTION TO MOVE FIGHT AND A DEPTH TO WHAT STRATEGIES THERE ARE AND SPEAKING OF CHESS IT WOULD BE HARD NOT TO MENTION HIVE WHICH IS A FANTASTIC ABSTRACT LEARN HOW THE PIECES ARE PLACED AND MOVE AND YOU COULD POTENTIALLY PLAY THE GAME FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE NAD NEVER MASTER IT'S INTRICACIES

I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED BY YOU MENTIONING SUMMONER WARS I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY A COMPLEX GAME BUT GETTING A GRASP OF ALL THE PHASES AND HOW THEY WORK IS TOUGHER THAN A GAME LIKE GO OR BACKGAMMON AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE INDIVIDUAL CARDS THEMSELVES IT'S NOT A GAME I WOULD HAVE CALLED EASY TO LEARN NOT HARD BUT DEFINITELY NOT EASY
WHILE NOT THE SIMPLEST GAME TO LEARN BECAUSE OF THE ICONOGRAPHY RACE FOR THE GALAXY IS DEFINITELY DEEP AND TAKES TIME TO MASTER I STILL FEEL I HAVEN'T TRIED EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME

ONE OF THE MORE RECENT GAMES THAT I GOT AND I FEEL IT WILL TAKE TIME TO MASTER IS EVOLUTION CLIMATE IT IS VERY SIMPLE AND INTUITIVE TO LEARN
COSMIC ENCOUNTER THERE IS LEGIT STRATEGY TO THAT GAME AND LEARNING YOUR OPPONENTS AND THEIR ABILITIES WHEN TO ALLY WHEN TO GO SOLO MAN SUCH A GREAT GAME
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO CHESS HERE AS WELL AS GO ANOTHER ONE TO CONSIDER IS POKER IF YOU ARE IN TO BLUFFING AND PLAYING YOUR OPPONENT'S MIND MORE THAN THEIR CARDS
TRADITIONAL BOARD GAMES GO SHOGI CHINESE CHESS CHESS DESCENDING SORT OF COMPLEXITY

MODERN BOARD GAMES SUMMONER WARS STONE AGE AGRICOLA GALAXY TRUCKER THAT'S ALL I'M PLAYING NOW THERE MAY BE MANY MORE GAMES THAT FITS YOUR BILL
ADD DIPLOMACY TO THE TRADITIONAL BOARD GAMES LIST IT CAN BE HARD TO FIND FACE TO FACE GROUPS TO GET THE FULL EFFECT BUT WHEN YOU DO THE DISCUSSION AND BACK STABBING CAN BE EPIC RULES ARE EASY BUT GETTING THEM TO WORK WITH EVERYONE ORDERS CAN BE INTERESTING
I'M GOING TO GO A DIFFERENT ROUTE AND SAY DIPLOMACY OR CHINATOWN THE RULES ARE SIMPLE AND ALL THE COMPLEXITY IS IN HUMAN INTERACTIONS
SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE IS EASY TO LEARN BUT THE GAME WILL KICK YOUR ASS OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON GAMES I'VE WON TWICE
HONESTLY I THINK I WOULD CONSIDER POKER AS ONE ITS EASY TO LEARN THE RULES BUT TO MASTER BLUFFING AND READING OTHER PLAYERS IS WHERE THE FUN REALLY BEGINS AND CAN TAKE YEARS OF PLAYING TO MASTER
TWIXT IF ANYONE HAS PLAYED THAT CLASSIC INCREDIBLY SIMPLE RULES CONNECT TWO ENDS OF THE BOARD TOGETHER WITH PEGS AND BRIDGES PLACE PEG PER TURN IT'S A TOUGH ONE TO MASTER ALL THE STRATEGIES
SANTORINITE IS COMING OUT AND MIGHT FIT THIS BILL
ONITAMA IS BASICALLY A SIMPLER VERSION OF CHESS WITH A COOL MECHANIC FOR DICTATING HOW YOUR PIECES MOVE
DOMINION I CAN TELL SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH IT WHEN THEY TRY TO SAY THERE'S A LOT OF LUCK INVOLVED
CHECKERS CAN BE SURPRISINGLY DEEP IF YOU PLAY IT FORCED JUMPS WHICH IS THE OFFICIAL WAY I'M A CHESS PLAYER BUT DAMNED IF CHECKERS ISN'T MORE FUN AND I FIND MORE DIFFICULT YOU CAN SET UP TRAPS HAVE COME BEHIND WINS AND ONCE YOU GET INTO IT YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF THINKING WAY WAY AHEAD IN MOVES
I THINK TEXAS BELONGS IN THIS LIST A LIFETIME TO MASTER THAT GAME
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT FLASK YOU CAN LEAD TO PLAY IN SECONDS BUT DAMMIT IF YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT BALL IS GOING
THE RINER KING GAME INGENIOUS WITH THE COLORED SYMBOL TILES LEARN IN MINUTES BUT THE WINNER BEING DECIDED BY EACH PLAYER'S WEAKEST COLOR MAKES THE ENTIRE GAME GO FROM OKAY TO GREAT
LAS VEGAS DICE GAME
FOR SALE
QUORIDOR IS THE FIRST ANSWER THAT POPPED INTO MY HEAD ALL YOU DO IS EITHER MOVE YOUR PAWN OR PLACE A WALL ONLY MINOR COMPLICATION IS YOU CANNOT PLACE A WALL THAT COMPLETELY CUTS OFF THE BOARD IT'S ON BOARDGAMEARENA IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN TRYING
SAPIENS

EASY TO LEARN HARD TO MASTER

IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN IT READ JUST THAT ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE BOX
SO WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS ON THE PROJECT WHEN WILL YOU START ROLLING THE VERSIONS OUT
NICE I SEEM TO REMEMBER TELLING SOMEONE TO MAKE AN APP LIKE THIS A WHILE AGO MAYBE IT WAS YOU I SPOKE TO ORIGINALLY MAYBE NOT BUT GLAD SOMEONE HAS DONE THE WORK

WILL BE AWESOME IF YOU GET IT POPULAR
VR IS GOING TO BE AMAZING FOR TABLETOP GAMING GAMING GROUP LIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY NO PROBLEM IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE RIGHT ACROSS THE TABLE
IF YOU ARE BIDDING ON A POWERPLANTS GO FOR ONES THAT WILL NOTABLY INCREASE YOUR POWERING POTENTIAL BUYING A POWERPLANTS IN THE TO POWER ONE MORE CITY IS A BAD VALUE PROPOSITION ADDITIONALLY DON'T BE AFRAID TO ONLY USE TWO OF YOUR POWERPLANTS SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER VALUE TO STORE RESOURCES ON YOUR THIRD INSTEAD OF POWERING EXTRA CITIES ESPECIALLY AS YOU HIT DIMINISHING RETURNS WITH MORE CITIES

KEEP AN EYE ON PHASE 2 IDEALLY YOU WANT TO ACTIVATE IT AND IMMEDIATELY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CHEAPEST LOCATIONS
WATCH FOR END GAME PLANTS AND BID AGGRESSIVELY FOR THEM IN A GAME TO THAT'S USUALLY ANYTHING WITH PLUS CAPACITY ALTHOUGH IT MAY VARY IF IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE IS GOING TO PUSH TO END EARLY

WATCH FOR A BUNCH OF HIGH PLANTS TO COME OUT EARLY FREQUENTLY IN MID TO LATE STEP 2 THE MARKET CLOGS WITH PLANTS NOBODY WANTS BECAUSE THEY ONLY POWER OR CITIES GETTING A MUCH NEEDED UPGRADE BEFORE THIS HAPPENS IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE ANY GOOD PLANT THAT COMES OUT DURING A SLUMP WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE

TRY TO MANAGE TURN ORDER SUCH THAT YOU BUY CITIES BEFORE ANYONE WHO WOULD BE FIGHTING FOR THE SAME LOCATIONS AS YOU THIS MAY MEAN BUYING FEWER CITIES ON A TURN SO THAT THE NEXT TURN YOU CAN GO EARLIER AND BUY THE CITIES YOU PASSED ON PLUS MORE THAT YOUR OPPONENTS WANT

IF SEVERAL PLAYERS ARE ONE CITY AWAY FROM STARTING STEP 2 GENERALLY YOU SHOULD NOT START IT UNLESS AT LEAST ONE AND PREFERABLY TWO OF THESE ARE TRUE YOUR INCOME MINUS FUEL COSTS ARE LESS ON AVERAGE THAN ANYONE YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST OR SECOND HIGHEST POWER PLANT YOU OR YOU CAN GET AND POWER OR MORE EXTRA CITIES WITHOUT GIVING UP ALL THE EXTRA INCOME IN CONNECTION COSTS GOING FIRST IN STEP 2 IS ALMOST ALWAYS A HUGE ADVANTAGE SO STARTING IT WHICH NORMALLY MEANS YOU'LL GO LAST THE NEXT TURN COMES WITH A HUGE OPPORTUNITY COST
I SPLURGE ON POWER PLANTS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE OTHER THINGS YOU SPEND MONEY ON HAVE A DECENT RUBBER BANDING EFFECT BUT IF GOOD POWER PLANTS JUST DON'T SHOW UP UNTIL PHASE YOU MIGHT HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES AND CITIES TO POWER THE MOST BUT NOT THE ACTUAL PLANTS TO POWER THAT MUCH

OTHER THAN THAT I TRY TO END EVERY TURN WITH AS LITTLE MONEY AS POSSIBLE
NEVER UPGRADE EACH POWER PLANT MORE THAN ONE TIME THAT'S A WASTE OF MONEY
THE FIRST POWER PLANT YOU BOUGHT IN THE GAME WILL BE REPLACED WITH A NEW PLANT THAT POWERS CITIES
IN MY GROUP THERE IS OFTEN A TIE FOR 1ST PLACE A LOT OF TIES ARE BROKEN BY OR LESS SO EVERY ELECTRO COUNTS

TRY TO GET THE OR AS YOUR THIRD PLANT YOU CAN USUALLY BID A LOT FOR THESE UPWARDS OF CHANCES ARE THESE ARE ALTHOUGH JUST BARELY GOOD ENOUGH TO CARRY YOU TO THE END

BUILDING IN THE CITIES ADJACENT TO THE CHEAPEST CONNECTION COSTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME IS GREAT BUT IT MIGHT BE A TRAP CONSIDER THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE FORCED TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN CONNECTION COSTS LATER IN THE GAME WHEN YOU ENTER STEP 2 AND MONEY IS SOMETIMES TIGHTER LATE GAME THAN IT IS IN THE EARLY GAME


SCORE MORE POINTS THAN THE OTHER PLAYER
HEROQUEST

NOTHING BUT HEROQUEST
GLORY TO ROME BLACK BOX
I'D PROBABLY GO BACK TO THE LATE NOUGHTINESS AND GET A BUNCH OF HEROSCAPE STUFF I'D ALSO LIKE A COPY OF STAR WARS THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT BUT THERE WASN'T REALLY ANY OVERLAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO MAYBE I COULD PICK UP QUEEN'S GAMBIT FOR AN ELEVATED BUT NOT YET COMPLETELY INSANE PRICE WHILE GETTING THE HEROSCAPE STUFF
I WOULD GO BACK TO BLACK AND READ AND BUY THE USED COPY OF DUNGEON RUN IT WAS MAYBE I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS AN OUT OF PRINT GAME I THINK I GOT FIREFLY INSTEAD
I WOULD GET IT FOR THESE REASONS IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE

I AM A BIG PHS SANDBOY ADD TO MY COLLECTION

MOST DEFINITELY HEROSCAPE MY BROTHER AND I WHIP IT OUT SOMETIMES STILL WHEN I VISIT HOME IT'S KEPT AT MY PARENTS HOUSE

IMO THE MINI QUALITY IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH MANY GAMES TODAY AND IT WAS PAINTED THE GAME ITSELF IS VERY FUN IT'S COOL COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT ARMY THEMES AND USING THEIR INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS

MY COLLECTION IS PROBABLY ABOUT COMPLETE BUT I'D NEED WELL OVER TO COMPLETE IT AT THE EBAY PRICES
FIREBALL ISLAND
THANK YOU FOR ADDING THAT EDIT

I'D GRAB DIE MACHER QUEEN'S GAMBIT CONTAINER KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER OBVIOUSLY I'M JUMPING BETWEEN YEARS I CAN GO AND BUY ANY OF THEM CURRENTLY BUT I DESPISE PRICE GOUGING PRICKS
CARCASSONNE AND ALL ITS EXPANSIONS IN THEIR ORIGINAL ARTWORK
THE OBVIOUS CHOICE FOR ME WOULD BE TO BUY A BUNCH OF ALPHA BETA BLACK LOTUSES WHEN THEY JUST CAME OUT IF YOU WERE GOOD JUST BUY A BOX OF CARDS AND TRADE FOR ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BECOME OUT OF PRINT RARES
ALL THE ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER I CAN GET AND MULTIPLE COPIES SO I CAN FLEABAG THEM AND STILL MAKE A PROFIT HERE
FOR PERSONAL WANTS HEROQUEST AND ALL OF ITS EXPANSIONS

FOR PROFIT BLACK LOTUS BEFORE M HUGE COMEBACK
MAGIC THE GATHERING BLACK LOTUSES
FORMULA DE MAPS SO MANY FORMULA DE MAPS
A BUNCH OF THOSE GAMESCIENCE ZOCCHIHEDRON BALLS I USED TO HAVE ONE BUT I LOST IT WHEN I LOST MY BOX OF MID S MTG CARDS NOW THOSE STUPID USELESS DICE GO FOR EACH
I'D GO BACK AND NOT BUY I ALREADY SPENT AND USE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE
I THINK THE IDEA OF THIS POST ISN'T TO GO BACK AND GET SOMETHING TO BRING TO PRESENT DAY TO SELL AND MAKE MORE MONEY BUT TO GO BACK AND GET SOMETHING WHEN IT WAS RETAIL PRICE AT THE TIME BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIND IT ANY MORE BECAUSE IT'S OUT OF PRINT AND PEOPLE ARE ASKING INSANE AMOUNTS

IN THAT INSTANCE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONLY SOLD THROUGH MAIL ORDER WOULD BE TO GO BACK TO AND GET ROGER TRAFALGAR ONLY A LITTLE MORE THAN WERE PRODUCED AND WHEN THEY POP UP FOR SALE THESE DAYS THEY GO FOR OVER BACK THEN I THINK IT WAS LIKE OR IN MAIL ORDER

OTHER THAN THAT I CAN'T CURRENTLY THINK OF ANYTHING I WOULD GET MAYBE HEROQUEST OR WORLD OF WARCRAFT THE BOARD GAME
ORIGINAL MONOPOLY NOT THE VERSION WE KNOW NOW THE VERSION BY ELIZABETH MAGIE THAT WB STOLE OFF HERALDRY HER VERSION WAS TO WIN BY BEING THE MOST PHILANTHROPIC I'D ALSO USE THE TIME MACHINE TO MAKE SURE SHE GOT THE RICHES SHE DESERVED
TAKING USD BACK IN TIME TO BUY HOBBY GAMING GOODS THAT WILL BE WORTH SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IN CURRENT TIMES

IF I WERE GETTING STUFF JUST FOR ME TO KEEP I WOULD GET SOME OF THE REALLY EARLY GAMES WORKSHOP MINIS AND A FULL SET OF NECROMUNDA STUFF THAT'S UNGODLY EXPENSIVE BUT I LOVED ME SOME NECROMUNDA

I WOULD GO GET A BUNCH OF OLD MAGIC CARDS LIKE BLACK LOTUS ET CETERA AND EVEN THE DUAL LANDS TUNDRA TAIGA ET CETERA WHICH SOLD FOR SURPRISING AMOUNTS OF MONEY A FEW YEARS BACK I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST BANG FOR MY BUCK

THEN AGAIN A BUNCH OF COPIES OF DARK TOWER WOULD BE REALLY COOL TO BRING BACK WITH ME

FINALLY IF WE'RE GOING ALL-OUT BONKERS HERE I'D GO BACK IN TO ANTIQUITY AND HAVE SOME ARCHEOLOGICAL GAME BOARDS BENET ANYONE GO UR HAND MADE BY ARTISANS AT THAT TIME AND THEN JUST RAKE IN THE DOUGH
A LOT OF THE OLDER MTG CARDS LIKE ARABIAN NIGHTS ERA I LOVED THE ARTWORK ON THEM

BESIDES THAT WARHAMMER BATTLE FOR MACRAGGE AN ANES AND THINGS LIKE CHROMO TRIGGER MARIO RPG ETC
VALUABLE COMICS WHICH ARE NOW COLLECTABLE SELL THE SAME IN THE PRESENT BUY ALL THE CURRENT STUFF I WANT
I WOULD GO BACK IN TIME TO THE VERY FIRST GAME HOBBY STORE AND THEN BRING THE BACK TO THE PRESENT DAY ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION AND SPEND IT ON MODERN GAMES THAT WILL MAKE ME FORGET ABOUT ANYTHING I CAN'T CURRENTLY HAVE AND BUY A LARGER HOUSE WITH A DEDICATED GAME ROOM
I MEAN WITH THIS KIND OF POWER WHY NOT USE THE TO BUY STOCKS OF FACEBOOK GOOGLE APPLE OR SOME OTHER HUGELY SUCCESSFUL TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION YOUR WOULD BE WORTH LIKE NOW

EVEN BETTER IS TO GRAB LAST WINNING LOTTERY NUMBERS AND GO BACK IN TIME JUST ONE WEEK AND BUYING THOSE EXACT NUMBERS YOU'LL TURN 2 INTO WITH BASICALLY NO EFFORT WHATSOEVER
FREEDOM THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD
THE CAPTAIN IS DEAD IS THE MOST CHALLENGING CO-OP I'VE PLAYED GAMES COME DOWN TO THE WIRE ALMOST EVERY TIME

THE SURVIVING CREW OF THE SHIP NEEDS TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET REMAINING VITAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS ONLINE AND KEEP THEM ONLINE ALL THE WHILE ALIENS THAT MUST BE DEALT WITH ARE BOARDING THE SHIP
CRITICAL SHIP SYSTEMS WILL GO DOWN

THE CREW NEEDS GET THE JUMP CORE BACK ONLINE SO THEY CAN WARP OUT OF HERE THE CREW LOSES THE GAME IF THE SHIP TAKES TOO MUCH DAMAGE OR IF THEY'RE OVERWHELMED BY ALIENS
BURGLE BROS
IT'S NOT REALLY HEAVY BUT BEYOND BAKER STREET IS FANTASTIC IT'S A LITTLE LIKE HANAFI BUT FEELS LIKE THERE'S MORE MEAT ON THE BONES OR AT LEAST SOME THEME I'D PUT IT ON PAR WITH THE UNIVERSE GAMES NAUTILICONE IS RELEASING IN EARLY DECEMBER BY THE WAY

MY WIFE AND I ALSO LIKE LEGENDS OF ANDOR THOUGH WE'RE NOT TOO FAR IN YET DON'T GET THE FFA VERSION AS IT HAS TONS OF ERRORS ON THE CARDS AND MANUAL AND TILES

SHADOWRUN CROSSFIRE IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE AND QUICK CO-OP DECKBUILDER WITH PERSISTENT UPGRADABLE CHARACTERS WE LIKE IT BUT IT'S DIFFICULT AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE WEIGHT WOULD COME IN

BLACK ORCHESTRA I HAVE NOT PLAYED IT YET BUT I'VE GOT A COPY ON ORDER BECAUSE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO PLOT TO ASSASSINATE HITLER

THERE'S ALSO LEGACY SECOND EDITION THAT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THEM I HAVE NOT YET PLAYED IT BUT I'VE WATCHED PLAYTHROUGHS AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT DON'T GET THE FIRST EDITION THOUGH THE BOX IS GIGANTIC AND THE COMPONENTS SUBPAR QUALITY
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES IS BASICALLY LIKE FLASH POINT MIXED WITH FORBIDDEN ISLAND PIRATES SKELETONS AND TREASURE PRETTY GREAT COOP

LEGENDARY MARVEL IS AN ABSOLUTE BLAST THE BASE SET ALONE IS A LITTLE EASY BUT THERE'S TONS OF EXPANSIONS FOR IT
JUST CURIOUS HOW COME THE APP IS A TURN OFF FOR MANSIONS OF MADNESS 2ND EDITION
MIGHT BE WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT THE UPCOMING MISTFALL HEART OF THE MISTS RELEASE THE FIRST ONE WAS AN EXCELLENT SOLO CO-OP GAME WITH A PRETTY FAIRLY HEAVY AND OVERLY COMPLEX RULESET THE ONE COMING OUT NOW HAS A MORE STREAMLINED SET OF INSTRUCTIONS AND IF THEY END UP LIKING IT THEY CAN PICK UP THE ORIGINAL MISTFALL FOR MORE VARIETY
BOMB SQUAD

FORTUNE AND GLORY

SPACE CADETS AWAY MISSIONS

GALAXY DEFENDERS

HEROES WANTED IS COMPETITIVE BUT THE CHAMPIONS AND MASTERMINDS EXPANSIONS PROVIDE A COOPERATIVE MODE
ALRIGHT SO IT MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE STRANGE SINCE THE BASE GAME ISN'T CO-OP BUT YOU'VE ALREADY LISTED SO MANY CO-OP GAMES SO MAYBE IT'S WORTH A LOOK

ORLEANS PLUS THE INVASION EXPANSION WHICH AS PART OF IT TURNS IT INTO A PRETTY GOOD CO-OP EXPERIENCE

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WOULD BE THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING TO GET BOTH THE BASE AND EXPANSION ALL AT ONCE BUT I FIGURED I'D MENTION IT ANYWAYS SINCE IT MIGHT NOT COME UP ON ANY CO-OP GAME LISTS
MAYBE SOMETHING FROM APG DARKEST NIGHT AND DAWN OF THE ZEDS ARE BOTH GOOD
MY WIFE AND I PLAY A LOT OF CO OPS YOU'VE MENTIONED MOST OF THEM BUT CAN ALSO RECOMMEND BIG BOOK OF MADNESS WARHAMMER QUEST ACS SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL YGGDRASIL WE HAVE SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE WHICH IS FINE BUT WE DON'T LOVE IT WE'VE BOUGHT BUT NOT YET PLAYED MYTHOS TALES STAR TREK FRONTIERS AND THE RAVENS OF HRI SAHASHRI CHRISTMAS

GOOD LUCK IN YOUR SEARCH
LEGENDS OF ANDOR

COMMISSIONED

GALAXY TRUCKER
NOW THIS IS THE STRANGEST GAME OF CATAN I'VE EVER HEARD DESCRIBED
IN GENERAL IT'S CONSIDERED GOOD FORM TO ACTUALLY TELL US THE NAME OF YOUR GAME IN QUESTION NOT JUST IMPLY THE NAME AFTER AN ELLIPSIS


IS THIS ABOUT ONE NIGHT WEREWOLF
WHY WOULD THE HUNTER SHOOT THE TANNER
MAYBE R BOARDGAMESCIRCLEJERK CAN HELP
SO THE RULES OF THE GAME WERE REVISED WHEN FORGOTTEN KING THE SECOND BASE GAME CAME OUT ANYTHING WITH HAS THE REVISED RULES ON THE CARDS ANYTHING FROM BEFORE THAT HAS THE RULES WRITTEN WITH RESPECT TO SUPER DUNGEON EXPLORE 1ST EDITION BASICALLY IF YOU THINK YOU WILL ONLY GET THE BASE GAME AND NOT FORGOTTEN KING YOU COULD GET THE VERSIONS OF THINGS TO GO WITH IT OTHERWISE BUY TO GET THE MOST UP TO DATE RULES IF YOU HAVE TO BUY ALL THE CARDS TO UPGRADE TO CAN BE BOUGHT TOGETHER IN THE FORGOTTEN KING UPGRADE DECK WHICH INCLUDES CARDS TO UPGRADE THE BASE GAME TOO

THE GENERAL ADVICE IS TO FIRST BUY A BASE GAME SD OR FORGOTTEN KING THE ORIGINAL SD REQUIRES ASSEMBLY FOR MINIATURES BUT NONE OF THE LATER CONTENT DOES PERSONALLY I WOULD GET FORGOTTEN KING NOW BECAUSE SD IS GETTING A REPRINT NEXT YEAR THAT WILL INCLUDE THE NEWEST VERSION OF THE RULES AND ASSEMBLED MINIATURES

IF YOU LIKE IT BUY THE OTHER BASE GAME AS IT WILL GIVE YOU THE MOST CONTENT FOR THE PRICE CAVERNS OF ROTOR AND VON DRAKE OFFER NEW SETS OF MONSTERS HEROES BOSSES AND WOULD BE THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP TO GET AFTER THE TWO BASE GAMES THE REST OF THE PACKS ARE JUST MORE FIGURES WHICH ALLOW THE HEROES AND OVERLORD MORE CHOICE WHEN PICKING CHARACTERS NO NEED TO GET THEM UNTIL YOU ARE VERY EXPERIENCED WITH THE BASE GAMES

SD LEGENDS IS IN DEVELOPMENT ALONG SIDE THE REPRINT VERSION OF THE BASE GAME LEGENDS ADDS A CAMPAIGN WHERE YOU CAN EVOLVE YOUR CHARACTERS OVER MANY GAMES PLAYED IN SEQUENCE LIKE AN RPG IT WON'T BE OUT UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT NOW THAT IS ALSO WHEN THE THIRD VERSION OF THE BASE RULES WILL COME OUT TO HELP STREAMLINE THE GAME MORE I'M PETTY SURE SODA POP MINIATURES IS GOING TO RELEASE THESE RULES AS DFS ONLINE SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THEM IF YOU WANT TO TRY THEY'RE BEING PLAYTESTED BY THE HARDCORE FANS RIGHT NOW
HELLO
SUPER DUNGEON EXPLORE HAS TWO EDITIONS THE LATEST BEING SUPER DUNGEON EXPLORE THE FORGOTTEN KING WHICH HAS CLEANED UP THE GAME COMPARED TO THE FIRST EDITION MAKING IT EASIER TO PLAY AND LESS CONFUSING
AS SD FORGOTTEN KING IS THE SECOND EDITION AND THE RECOMMEND VERSION TO PICKUP YOU WANT TO GET EXPANSIONS THAT ARE FOR SO THEY ARE COMPATIBLE THERE IS A UPGRADE PACK YOU CAN BUY TO USE STUFF

I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING THE GAME FIRST PLAY IT A FEW TIMES AND ONCE YOU HAPPY THEN LOOK INTO BUYING MORE

SD IS ALSO A FUN GAME TO PAINT EVEN IF YOU HAVE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE PRIME BOLD SIMPLE COLOURS BLACK WASH DRY BRUSH A LIGHTER COLOUR ON TOP TO GIVE DEPTH AND THEN GLOSS

CHECK OUT SD AT BOARD GAME GEEK AS THE FORUM HAS MANY HELPFUL OWNERS

I'M SURE SOMEBODY WILL REPLY WITH A BETTER MORE IN DEPTH ANSWER SHORTLY
OH AND LEGENDS IS AN EXPANSION THAT AIMS TO GIVE SD A CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

COUP IS THE PERFECT GAME FOR THIS CHEAP AND INCREDIBLY SIMPLE TO TEACH TOO

I ALSO LOVE THE BLUFFING ASPECTS OF CONDOTTIERE ALSO KNOWN AS GWENT IF YOU'RE A WITCHER FAN THE GAME IS TRICKY TO FIND BUT CAN BE HAD IN CHINESE FOR RELATIVELY CHEAP THE GAME ITSELF IS LANGUAGE INDEPENDENT SO YOU'D JUST NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE RULES IN ENGLISH
RESISTANCE AVALON WOULD BE YOUR BEST BET IF YOU HAVE PLAYERS
THE RESISTANCE AND COUP ALWAYS COME TO MIND DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG MIGHT ALSO FIT THE BILL ALTHOUGH IT'S LESS ABOUT READING A PERSON DIRECTLY
ALL THESE AND THESE SHORT LIGHT PARTY GAMES SKULL GOOD COP BAD COP DEAD LAST LIAR'S DICE SPYFAULT AND MAFIA DA CUBA

AND DEPENDING HOW YOU PLAY IT AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MEATIER A GAME OF THRONES THE BOARD GAME

DEAD OF WINTER OR COSMIC ENCOUNTER IF YOU WANT SOMETHING
DECEPTION MURDER IN HONG KONG

RESISTANCE AVALON

ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF

COUP REFORMATION

CASH N GUNS 2ND EDITION

IF YOU WANT TO STINK YOUR TEETH INTO MECHANICS

COSMIC ENCOUNTER
I THIRD COUP FUN PARTY GAME
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF

SECRET HITLER
COUP COMES TO MIND ALSO POKER CITADELS HAS SOME IN IT AS DOES LIBERALIA
DIPLOMACY OFFERS A MIX OF BOTH BUT DEFINITELY LEANS MORE ON THE SIDE OF READING THE OTHER PLAYERS
THE BROKEN TOKEN SELLS A VERY NICE PADDED BAG ON THEIR WEBSITE LIKE EVERYTHING THEY SELL IT IS OF VERY HIGH QUALITY AND HAS LASTED ITS WAY TO MANY MANY CONS AND BACK
I ORDERED ONE SHOULD BE HERE NEXT WEEK

YOU CAN BUY IKEA BAGS OR LIKE GROCERY BAGS FOR THE SAME PRICE THESE ARE PROBABLY FINE BUT COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE WITH TWO PLAYERS AND I THINK EVEN A LITTLE BIT EASIER I MADE THE EXPERIENCE THAT DIFFICULTY INCREASES WITH PLAYER NUMBER BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS WAYS TO ADJUST THE DIFFICULTY SO NO PROBLEMS THERE

I JUST LOADED THE FIRST SCENARIO AND IT WILL BE AROUND CARDS YOU CAN SLEEVE THEM IN ONE SETTING BECAUSE YOU WILL USUALLY HAVE A LOT OF CARD SORTING TO DO ANYWAY

THE GAME IS JUST GREAT YOU CAN PLAY AND REPLAY SCENARIOS USING DIFFERENT AVATARS YOU CAN ADJUST THE DIFFICULTY YOU CAN USE A TRAITOR MODULE TO SPICE THINGS UP A LOT TO REPLAY THERE
FIRSTLY HOW WELL DOES IT PLAY WITH JUST 2 PLAYERS

IT PLAYS FINE AT TWO BUT DOING SO REALLY DROPS THE DIFFICULTY IN CONTRAST PLAYING WITH A FULL FIVE IS HARD MODE THOUGH I HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH THE 1ST 2ND MOVIE AT SO IT IS NOT UNBEATABLE

OVERALL I REALLY ENJOY THE GAME AND AM CURRENTLY LOOKING FORWARD TO FINALLY GETTING THE EXPANSION FOR IT THAT RELEASES AT THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER

AS FOR SLEEVES I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY YOU WILL NEED FOR JUST THE FIRST GAME OFFHAND DO EXPECT AT LEAST AN HOUR OF JUST SORTING CARDS BEFORE PLAYING NEVER MIND THE TIME IT TAKES TO SLEEVE WHAT YOU NEED TO

I PERSONALLY HAVE COLOR CODED MY DECKS TO MAKE SORTING EASIER THERE ARE ONLY A FEW CARDS THAT GO BETWEEN DECKS MAINLY THE SCENARIO AND PLAYER ONES AND FOR THOSE I MADE A COPIES OF AND PUT IN THE CORRESPONDING COLORED SLEEVES I ALSO KEEP SPARE SLEEVES IN THE BOX FOR ANYTHING I MISSED

BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KEEP IT SIMPLE THERE ARE ONLY TWO DIFFERENT CARD BACKS IN THE GAME SO YOU CAN EITHER GO WITH ONE COLOR OR TWO COLORS AND BE ALRIGHT

I HAVE PLAYED THIS SOLO 2 PLAYER PLAYER AND THE RULEBOOK HAS A GUIDE FOR THE NUMBER OF CARDS YOU NEED TO SCALE THE DIFFICULTY ACCORDINGLY THE LESS PEOPLE YOU HAVE THE LESS DOWNTIME EACH PLAYER HAS SO IT DOES BECOME EASIER

I LOVE THE GAME AS BOTH AN ALIEN FAN AND GAMER
JUST A HEADS UP THE CARDS COME IN SEEMINGLY RANDOM ORDER THERE IS TINY PRINT ON THE BOTTOM OF EACH CARD SAYING WHAT DECK IT BELONGS IN TOOK ME WELL OVER AN HOUR JUST TO UNBOX AND SORT THE CARDS OUT LONGER IF YOU'RE SLEEVING
GAME IS AMAZING IF YOU LIKE ALIEN IT'S EVEN BETTER

DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND DOWNLOAD PRINT THIS ONE PAGE CARD SORTING LIST

YOU WILL KNOW EVERYTHING IS IN THE RIGHT DECK AND BE SURE YOU AREN'T MISSING ANYTHING
MOST OF THE CARDS NEED THE SAME COLOR SLEEVE BECAUSE THEY ARE MIXED TOGETHER I'M USING BLACK BECAUSE IT FITS THE THEME FOR THE OBJECTIVE CARDS I SELECTED BLUE LOCATIONS BROWN HATCHERY ORANGE AND RED ALSO I PRINTED SOME DIVIDERS THAT YOU CAN FIND IN THE GAME FORUM ON BOARDGAMEGEEK WITH NICE PICTURES
I CAN HELP WITH THE FIRST AND THIRD QUESTIONS

I THINK THE GAME PLAYS PRETTY WELL WITH 2 PLAYERS BUT IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER DECKBUILDERS I THINK THAT TWO PLAYERS CAN START TO BECOME A BIT EASY AFTER A GAME OR TWO OF POTENTIALLY GETTING WRECKED WHILE LEARNING SOME OF THE UNIQUE MECHANICS

I FOUND PLAYERS TO BE THE SWEET SPOT AND AT THE GAME STARTS TO BECOME A GOOD BIT MORE DIFFICULT AND TENSE FOR TWO PLAYERS IT MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING HAVING EACH PLAY TWO CHARACTERS OR STICK TO ONE AVATAR EACH AND TRY SOME OF THE OTHER INCLUDED RULES INCLUDED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS TAKING DRONES OUT WILL HELP CRANK THINGS UP

AS FOR THOUGHTS I REVIEWED LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS ALIEN DECK BUILDER FOR BOARDGAMEBUDS AND ENDED UP REALLY LIKING IT AND THIS IS FROM SOMEONE WHO GOT SICK OF MARVEL LEGENDARY VERY QUICKLY I THINK A LOT OF THE MECHANICS JUST NAIL THE THEME OF THE MOVIES AND EVEN THE INCLUDED PLAYER ALIEN VARIANT IS GREAT AND ADDS TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY

I DON'T WANT MY FIRST POINT TO MAKE THE GAME SOUND EASY BECAUSE THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES WE PLAYED IT WE GOT BEAT PRETTY BADLY CHESTBURSTERS ARE NASTY
BOARDS AND CINDER BLOCKS
DO YOU LIVE IN MONTREAL BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY ROLL
I WENT WITH THE IKEA IVAR LINE ITS A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE BUT I LIKE HAVING WOODEN SHELVES THEY ALSO SETUP TAKEDOWN PRETTY QUICKLY AND ARE COMPACT
EVERYONE IS A FIRST TIME CREATOR AT SOME POINT WHAT IMPRESSES ME IS THE PROJECTS YOU YOURSELF HAVE BACKED GOOD LUCK TO YOU IT LOOKS INTERESTING
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'D BE PRETTY FUN BUT IT JUST FEELS LOOKS LIKE THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH IN THE GAME FOR ME AT LEAST PART OF ITS PROBABLY I'M NOT A FAN OF MEMORY IN GAMES

THAT SAID I REALLY LIKE THE THEME AND ART AND WOULDN'T OBJECT IF SOMEONE WERE TO BRING THIS GAME TOT THE TABLE

HOPE YOU GET FUNDED
WELCOME TO THE KICKSTARTER DESIGNERS CLUB DUDE I JOINED A DESIGN TEAM AS WE GOT OUR FIRST GAME FUNDED EARLIER THIS YEAR AND IT'S A LOT OF WORK BUT A LOT OF FUN SO FAR DARKLIGHT MEMENTO MORI IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IT OUT

LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOT A QUICK AND FUN GAME THERE GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING AND I HOPE THE FUNDING GOES WELL

LOOKS INTERESTING YOU'LL PROBABLY BE DOWNVOTED FAIRLY HARD THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WEIRD ABOUT SELF PROMOTION SO IT WOULD PROBABLY BE SMART TO BE A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE ABOUT IT THIS IS DOUBLY TRUE FOR A GAME LIKE YOURS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY GOING FOR A WIDE APPEAL PEOPLE TEND TO BE MORE ACCEPTING IF SOMEONE IS PUSHING SOMETHING THAT IS A BIT RISKIER
IS THIS INSPIRED BY SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM

THAT'S A PREIMAGINING OF CONTRABAND WHICH HAS THE SAME THEME AS YOUR GAME
THE AESTHETIC IS REALLY GREAT AND THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CARDS HAVE A VISUAL DISTINCTION A LOT OF GAMES FAIL TO PULL OFFICIAL KUDOS TO YOUR ART GUY
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU SIR
READ THE RULES AND FEEL THEY ARE A BIT UNCLEAR SO HERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS

HOW ARE BAGGAGE CARDS SUPPOSED
TO BE PLACED IN FRONT OF YOU IN A PILE
LIKE A DECK OR A ROW
THE SETUP ORDER SEEMS OFFICIAL THIS IS
HOW I READ IT
YOU SEPARATE THE BAGGAGE FROM
THE PASSENGERS
2 DEAL BAGGAGE CARDS
SHUFFLE BAGGAGE AND PASSENGER
CARDS TOGETHER
DEAL PASSENGER CARDS
HOWEVER THEY ARE NOW MIXED IS IT OK TO
RECEIVE BAGGAGE CARDS AT THIS TIME
GOOD LUCK THIS LOOKS FAIRLY POLISHED FOR A FIRST DESIGN
SOUNDS LIKE A MIX OF ANIS AND MISSION RED PLANET
LOOKS FUN GOOD LUCK WITH GETTING BACKED I MIGHT PLEDGE IF MY GAMING GROUP IS KEEN
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE REACHED YOUR GOAL BRATS I REALLY LIKE THE THEME AND OVERALL SIMPLICITY OF THE GAME ALMOST EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THE SILLY AIRPORT REQUIREMENTS ARE SO YOU CAN INTRODUCE PEOPLE REALLY EASILY GOOD LUCK WITH THE FINISHING TOUCH
GREAT JOB SO FAR HOPE THE BEST FOR YA

LOVE THE GAME CONCEPT CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING YOUR KICKSTARTER GOAL TOO I CAN'T RESIST BEING ABLE TO ADD SOMETHING TO A GAME SO I PLEDGED THE ADD AN ITEM EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ALREADY BEYOND THE GOAL
CONGRATS FOR FUNDING YOUR GAME


I HAVE A RULE QUESTION HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T MIND ANSWERING HERE DOES ANY OTHER PASSENGER CARDS AFFECTING CONCEALED CARDS STILL AFFECTS BAGGAGE PROTECTED BY THE AMBASSADOR CARD

SO IF I USE MY AMBASSADOR ON BAGGAGE A CAN ANOTHER PLAYER SWAP STEAL IT
LOOKS LIKE A FUN SIMPLE GAME WILL DEFINITELY BE BACKING SOON
CONGRATS ON GETTING FUNDED I ALSO BACKED I WAS ASKED THIS QUESTION SO MANY TIMES BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF EXPLOSIVE ALARMS GOING OFF FROM IPADS AND SECURITY AND WHAT NOT

PLUS PLAYERS IS A BIG
LOOKS COOL AND LOVE THE DESIGN CONGRATS ON HITTING YOUR GOAL
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANY NAYSAYERS HERE THE LAST GAME I REMEMBER THE SNOBS IN THIS FORUM TURNING THEIR NOSE UP TO WAS UNFAIR AND THAT ENDED UP BEING A NICE LITTLE SUCCESS STORY
REMINDS ME OF SMUGGLE A GAME I HAD AS A KID
CONGRATS MAN I WISH YOU TONS OF SUCCESS SIR
DELETED
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET A GOOD RESPONSE HERE BECAUSE THERE JUST ISN'T MUCH GAME IN YOUR IDEA IT'S MORE OF A PARTY ACTIVITY THAN A BOARD OR CARD GAME THIS SUBREDDIT IS PROBABLY NOT YOUR TARGET MARKET YOUR MARKET WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO TYPICALLY DON'T PLAY HOBBY GAMES

THERE IS NO GAME I READ YOUR WRITE-UP AND THERE ARE NO RULES IT'S JUST READ THE CARDS GAMES WITHOUT DIRECTION AREN'T VERY WELL RECEIVED WHY COULDN'T PEOPLE JUST LOOK UP QUESTIONS ON THE INTERNET AND READ THEM TO EACH OTHER WHY WOULDN'T THEY PLAY THE OTHER PARTY GAMES THAT DO THE SAME THING LIKE WOULD YOU RATHER LOADED QUESTIONS OR GAME OF THINGS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE RULES AND STRUCTURE

THE YELLOW TEXT ON THE JOKERS IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO READ I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A FINAL DRAFT BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD BE PUT OFF BY THOSE CARDS

I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHO WOULD PAY FOR THIS WHEN SOMEONE CAN GO TO TARGET AND GET WOULD YOU RATHER AND LOADED QUESTIONS FOR THE SAME PRICE PLUS A DECK OF CARDS FOR AN EXTRA 2

EDIT I MISREAD THE PRICE IT'S ONLY BUT THE POINT REMAINS WHY THIS OVER SOMETHING LIKE WOULD YOU RATHER
YOU'RE LUCKY THAT THIS IS THE MOST POLITE SUBREDDIT ON THE ENTIRE SITE
YOU SHOULD DROP THE PLAY ASK MATE TAGLINE IN MY OPINION TO A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER MATE IN THAT CONTEXT AS A VERB WILL BE INTUITIVELY BE INTERPRETED AS MEANING SEX I GUESS MAYBE YOU MEANT THAT AS A BIT OF FUN BUT YEAH IT READS ODD

A MATE IS A FRIEND TO MATE IS TO REPRODUCE MATE CARDS IS OK BUT IT'S STILL A BIT AWKWARD SOUNDING

GOOD LUCK
NO SNARK THIS SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD COME IN A HUMAN RESOURCES SO YOU JUST TOOK OVER A COMPANY AND FIRED HALF THE WORKERS SURVIVAL KIT


IF THIS IS MEANT TO FOSTER FRIENDSHIP ON A DEEPER LEVEL BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ALREADY INTERACT SOCIALLY YOU WOULD DO BETTER SIMPLY PICKING UP AN ALREADY PRODUCED FILLER GAME THAT IS EASY TO PICK UP AND HAVING PEOPLE INTERACT ORGANICALLY

ICE BREAKERS AND HR GET TO KNOW YOU GAMES ONLY MAKE TYPICAL PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE OR ANNOYED WHICH CAN LEAD TO AN US VS MANAGEMENT TEAM BUILDING GOAL BUT CERTAINLY NOT BUILD DEEPER FRIENDSHIPS BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO ALREADY INTERACT SOCIALLY
SEEMS OKAY BUT I CAN'T REALLY SAY I WOULD PLAY ANYTHING WITH A REGULAR DECK OF CARDS AND READING OFF QUESTIONS WOULD BE A BIT AWKWARD COMPARED TO THE SOCIAL GAMES I HAVE
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT SOME CRITIQUES SOME OF WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED ON BUT IN FURTHER DETAIL

THE NAME MATE HAS SEXUAL CONNOTATIONS MIGHT I SUGGEST THE SIMPLE NAME MEET INSTEAD SEEMS TO HIT THE GOAL OF YOUR GAME AS WELL WITHOUT STIRRING PEOPLE UP

AS FAR AS A GAME YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ONE IT'S JUST A DECK OF CARDS AT THIS POINT THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU COULDN'T ADD SOMETHING SIMPLE GAME WISE FOR EXAMPLE PLAY LIKE WAR LOSER OF THE ROUND HAS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION DOESN'T HAVE TO BE COMPLEX BUT IT HELPS TO GIVE IT MORE PURPOSE

YOUR CATEGORIESIN GENERAL SEEM LIKE THEY COULD USE A LITTLE REFINEMENT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMBARRASSING STORY AND TRAINSPOTTING EXTREME IRONING CARVING EGGSHELLS IS MASSIVE ONE IS OPEN ENDED ENOUGH TO MEAN ANYTHING THE OTHER IS SO NICHE THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT SHOULD BE OF THE SAME SUIT BTW TRAINSPOTTING JUST MAKES ME THINK OF HEROIN AND DEAD BABIES CLIMBING ON THE CEILING

KIND OF IN THE SIMILAR VEIN HALF OF YOUR DECK SEEMS TO BE COMPOSED IN A SENTENCE STRUCTURE AND THE OTHER HALF IS A STATEMENT ONE JUST SAYS EMBARRASSING STORY THE OTHER IS WHEN I WAS SMALL I BELIEVED PERSONALLY I WOULD UNIFY THE DECK WOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS SAYING SHARE AN EMBARRASSING STORY OR SOMETHING TO THE AFFECTION

I'M NOT USUALLY ONE TO GET INVOLVED INTO THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM BUT YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO REWORD SUCH CARDS AS MY BROS CALL ME BUT MY MOMMY CALLS ME RE MOMMY THESE DAYS FAMILIES COME IN ALL DIFFERENT TYPES AND RE BROS IT FEELS MORE LIKE YOU'RE SPEAKING OF A BROTHER RATHER THAN FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU CHOSE SLANG WHICH SEEMS EVEN MORE ODD SINCE BESIDES THE NAME OF THE GAME THE OTHER EXAMPLES DON'T INCLUDE ANY

I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE FINAL PRODUCT WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I CAN'T READ THE YELLOW FONT VERY WELL COULD BE JUST ME OR MY SCREEN WOULD ASK YOU TO SWITCH IT TO PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER COLOR PERSONALLY TO MINIMIZE THE PAIN TO YOUR LOVELY DESIGN SO FAR I MIGHT SUGGEST PURPLE SINCE IT ALREADY OCCURS IN YOUR PRODUCT ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO PROVIDE A BLACK OUTLINE AROUND YOUR FONT THIS WOULD HELP WITH ALL THE CARDS ESPECIALLY IF USING IN A LOW LIGHT AREA

YOU DO HAVE LOVELY DESIGN HOWEVER AND I AT THE VERY LEAST LIKE THE IDEA OF YOUR PRODUCT ALL OF MY COMMENTS ARE GIVEN WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS GOOD LUCK
THIS GAME SOUNDS LIKE WHAT AN HR VP WOULD COME UP WITH FOR A TEAM BUILDING EXERCISE AT A SOULLESS CUBICLE FARM COMPANY
THE PROBLEM I AM SEEING HERE IS IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A THEMED DECK OF PLAYING CARDS THERE IS NO MECHANICAL REASON FOR ASKING THE QUESTIONS WHY NOT JUST USE A REGULAR DECK OF PLAYING CARDS AND PRINT OUT A LIST OF ICEBREAKER QUESTIONS
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF A BOARDGAME CALLED THE UNGAMY IT WAS MADE BY SOME DOCTOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND IT HAD 2 DECKS OF CARDS ONE WAS DEEP UNDERSTANDING AND THE OTHER LIGHT HEARTED BOTH DECKS ARE JUST A QUESTION TO ASK THE OTHER PLAYERS ANYHOW I ONCE BROUGHT THE CARDS ON A DATE AND ASKED EACH OTHER THE QUESTIONS AND HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION GOING THE WHOLE DATE I PROBABLY CAME ACROSS PRETTY GEEKY BUT WE HAD A GOOD DATE AND I GOT SOME TOO I THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT IDEA FOR A GAME
GOOD LUCK I APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF THE SUBREDDIT CAN I DO THAT U IF ANYONE ISN'T KIND TO YOU ABOUT YOUR IDEA


TIMELINE MUSIC AND CINEMA

BOARDGAME

IT'S A SIMPLE CASUAL GAME WHERE PLAYERS ARRANGE CARDS IN THIS CASE MUSIC AND MOVIES IN ORDER BY THE YEAR IT WAS PUBLISHED


SOUNDS LIKE THEY'D ENJOY CODENAMES
MAYBE LOOK AT THE GAME OF TONES

THERE WAS ANOTHER KOREAN GAME WHERE YOU PLAY NOTES BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME I THINK IT WAS AT THE BOARD GAME GEEK STORE AT ONE POINT I'LL TRY TO LOOK IT UP WHEN I GET HOME
THERE IS A GOOD LITTLE TRICK TAKING GAME CALLED TAKE THE A CHORD WHICH CAN BE BOUGHT RIGHT FROM JAPAN HERE

ITEMS

I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A GREAT UNIQUE GIFT FOR THE MUSIC FAN ALSO VERY SIMPLE DOUBLE POINTS IF SHE LIKES JAZZ FOR THE PUN IN THE TITLE ALONE
BRATS TO YOUR MOM ON HER DMA WHAT WAS HER DISSERTATION ON I STUDIED MUSIC BACK IN THE DAY IN COLLEGE WAS A GREAT TIME

HMM WINE CHATTING GAMING I WAS GOING TO RECOMMEND OPERA BUT THAT'S KIND OF A MEDIUM GAME AND DEF DOESN'T MEET YOUR CRITERIA FUNNY ENOUGH THERE'S BETTER WINE GAMES IN BOARD GAMING THAN THERE ARE BOARD GAMES I GUESS THAT'S A CONDO FOR ANOTHER TIME SORRY I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD BUT GREAT TOPIC AND ENJOYED YOUR POST

I SAY PLAY A BUNCH OF ROUNDS OF THE REGULAR BASE GAME DECK CARDS UNTIL EVERYONE GETS IT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG THEN BREAK OUT THE EXPANSION

AS FAR AS HOW MANY CARDS TO USE STICK WITH JUST REPLACE THE AMBASSADORS WITH THE INQUISITORS AND GIVE EVERYONE A TEAM CARD THE ADDITIONAL REGULAR CARDS IN REFORMATION ARE FOR PLAYING PEOPLE
THE EXTRA CARDS ARE ONLY USED IF YOU PLAY WITH MORE THAN PLAYERS

HOWEVER THE GAME WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THIS AND EVEN STATES THIS IN THE RULEBOOK IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THEY PUT IN AS A COMMON REQUEST PLUS IT'S GOOD TO HAVE ADDITIONAL CARDS IF THE OLD COUP CARDS GET MARKED

AS SOMEONE WHO HAS PLAYED A LOT OF REFORMATION YOU CAN PLAY IT EASILY PLAY IT EVEN FOR BEGINNERS THE GAME ISN'T THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND I WOULD SKIP THE INQUISITOR SINCE SHE IS WAY TOO STRONG I FIND THE REFORMATION EXPANSION TURNS INTO A GAME OF TACTICS AND BLUFFING INSTEAD OF STRAIGHT BLUFFING AND CAN EASILY WORK WITH AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE ODD NAME OF PLAYERS ISN'T AN ISSUE SINCE IT'S STILL A FREE FOR ALL
IT ULTIMATELY DEPENDS ON YOUR PREFERENCES HOWEVER I RECOMMEND STICKING WITH THE ORIGINAL CARD DECK FOR PLAYERS


I DON'T THINK MAKING BLUFFING EASIER AND DEDUCTION HARDER WILL MAKE THE GAME MORE FUN IT WILL SIMPLY LENGTHEN THE GAME AND TEAM PLAY FROM REFORMATION ALREADY DOES THAT IN A MORE INTERESTING WAY
I ALWAYS ADVISE AGAINST THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS BASE COUNT I ALWAYS PLAY BASES EQUAL TO PLAYER COUNT OR ONE LESS GETS EVERYTHING MOVING FASTER
HAVEN'T PLAYED MUCH AND HAVEN'T PLAYED WITH ALL THE EXPANSIONS BUT I'D PROBABLY AVOID WIZARDS AND ANY OTHER FACTIONS THAT CAN COMBO ENDLESSLY IT'S DIFFICULT TO MENTALLY STORE THE NUMBER OF ACTIONS CREATURES YOU HAVE TO PLAY WITH AFTER A VERY ROUND ITS ALSO BORING TO PLAY WITH AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT MY FRIENDS HAVE TOLD ME
I HAVE SMASH UP BUT I'M NOT A SMASH UP EXPERT THAT SAID I FEEL LIKE GHOSTS ARE KIND OF TOUGH TO COMBO WITH AT LEAST THE FEW TIMES I'VE PLAYED WITH THEM THEY DID NOT MESH WELL WITH THE FACTION THEY WERE PAIRED WITH
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME AND PLAY A DECENT AMOUNT AND HAVE SHOWN QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO PLAY I WOULD SAY THAT A COUPLE REALLY GOOD INTRODUCTORY FACTIONS WOULD BE DINOSAURS AND PRINCESSES BOTH OF THESE FACTIONS ARE FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND DON'T REQUIRE A WHOLE LOT OF COMPLEX PLAY I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND STAYING AWAY FROM CTHULHU FACTIONS FOR THE FIRST PLAY THROUGH WHILE I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THAT MADNESS CARDS ARE VERY CONFUSING TO FIGURE OUT I HAVE HAD SEVERAL NEW PLAYERS FEEL OVERWHELMED WHEN I TELL THEM THERE ARE EXTRA RULES ALIENS AND NINJAS ARE A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX THAN DINOSAURS AND PRINCESSES BUT THEY AREN'T TOO HARD TO FIGURE OUT ALSO CAN MAKE FOR A GREAT COMBO TO SPAM APS

I HOPE THAT HELPED AND I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK ON THE PLAY THROUGH HOPEFULLY YOUR KIDS LIKE IT IT IS A FANTASTIC GAME
HAVE YOU ASKED THEM
I JUST SIGNED UP FOR IT AND UNFORTUNATELY I ALSO JUST AGREED TO NOT TALK ABOUT IT
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A RECIPE FOR DISASTER BUT I WOULD LOVE IT IF THEY MADE IT WORK SATISFYINGLY
OTHER IDEAS
FURY OF DRACULA
FORTRESS AMERICA
TRAGEDY LOOPER IS A POSSIBILITY THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED YET IT'S A DEDUCTION HIDDEN MOVEMENT GAME WHERE ONE PLAYER PLAYS AS A MASTERMIND TRYING TO STOP THE THREE PROTAGONISTS FROM PASSING THROUGH A TIME LOOP
CONAN SEEMS RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY ONE VS ALL SCENARIO BASED

U GETINFO

IGNORE THAT'S THE WRONG GAME
HAVE A LOOK AT DAYS OF IRE BUDAPEST
I'LL SECOND TRAGEDY LOOPER ALTHOUGH I'VE ONLY PLAYED IT SO FAR I THINK IT WILL ONLY GET BETTER WHEN I CAN GO UP TO

I'LL ALSO RECOMMEND AGAINST LETTERS FROM WHITECHAPEL AT HIGH PLAYER COUNTS IT'S SAID TO BE BEST AT AND I'LL NEVER PLAY AGAIN WITH MORE THAN THAT WELL MAYBE I COULD BE CONVINCED TO TRY AT
THE BEST GAME I KNOW AND DIG IS FRIEDRICH WHICH IS A LARGE DEPARTURE FROM THE TITLES YOU'VE LISTED HERE BUT I'LL JUSTIFY

IT IS IN ESSENCE A PLAYER GAME EACH PLAYER HAS THEIR OWN VICTORY CONDITIONS AS WELL AS OF THE PLAYERS ARE TRYING TO STOP THE 4TH FRIEDRICH AS WELL AS THE CANNOT ATTACK EACH OTHER BUT CAN ATTACK FRIEDRICH

COMBAT IS REALLY NEAT WITH A SQUARED BOARD SHOWING POKER SUITS SCOTT VIDEO DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB OF GOING OVER MOST ASPECTS OF THE GAME AND THE DEPTH POSSIBILITY FOR REPEATED METALLARY IS FANTASTIC

IT IS ALSO A HISTORIC BUT I LIKEN IT MORE TO POKER LOTS AND LOTS OF BLUFF IN THIS ONE MEETS AREA CONTROL MEETS HEAVY BOARD GAME ACCESSIBLE THOUGH THE RULEBOOK IS RELATIVELY SMALL MEETS TEAM

IT IS PRETTY ROCKIE MANUAL OFTENTIMES THE THEME DOESN'T GET PEOPLE VERY STIFF BUT ONCE THEY PLAY I'VE HAD SOLID EXPERIENCES

GL
YOU SEEM TO BE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU CAN'T PLAY DESCENT MISSIONS AS ONE-SHOT ADVENTURES AND THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE THE SAME IS TRUE FOR IMPERIAL ASSAULT

EACH CAMPAIGN IS COMPRISED OF SCENARIOS PICK AN XP LEVEL CHOOSE SKILLS UP TO THAT LEVEL PLAY

I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH LEVEL OMEGA PROTOCOL'S MINIS AND THE GAME IS JUST EXCELLENT I CAN RECOMMEND IT FOR SURE

PERHAPS SUPER DUNGEON EXPLORE UNTIL THE LATEST KICKSTARTER IS SHIPPED THERE'S NO STORY AT ALL IT'S JUST A HACK N SLASH SESSION
GHOST STORIES BLACK SECRET WOULD BE A DIFFERENT APPROACH TRUE IT'S AN EXPANSION AND IS PROBABLY EVEN BETTER WITH THE WHITE MOON EXPANSION TRUE IT MAY NOT EXACTLY BE CAMPAIGN BASED BUT THIS GAME PLAYED SOLO AS A GROUP OR AS V ALL IN BLACK SECRET ALWAYS KEEPS YOU ON YOUR TOES AND REWARDS REPEATED PLAYS I'M MAKING A POINT TO PLAY GS TIMES IN WORTH A LOOK ANYWAY
I HAVE ONLY THE CORE SET I PICKED UP A FEW WEEKS AGO CURRENTLY PLAYED TIMES AND STILL GOT A LOT OF MILEAGE IN THE CORE SET THE INCLUDED SCENARIOS AND CARDS PLUS THE EXCELLENT CUSTOM SCENARIOS BY NINJADORG ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH I THINK IT GIVES YOU A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH SPHERE AND REALLY WHETHER YOU ACTUALLY LIKE THE GAME OR NOT

I HAVE PICKED UP MOST OF THE KIRKWOOD CYCLE FROM EBAY BUT NOT OPENED OR MIXED ANYTHING IN YET AS I KNOW ONCE I DO I WON'T GO BACK IT WAS MORE JUST SO I KNOW I HAVE IT

I CAN HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GUIDE IF YOU WANT TO GET EVERYTHING YOU CAN FROM THE CORE SET

ALSO IGNORE THE DOOM MONGERS THAT THE GAME IS DEAD YOU CAN FIND POSTS FROM THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SAYING THAT A NEW DELUXE EXPANSION IS OUT SOON PLUS THEY ARE YET TO FINISH THE SAGA EXPANSIONS AND THE PREVIOUS CYCLES ARE APPEARING ON THE REPRINT LIST AS ONE OF THEIR BEST SELLING CGS IT WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE LEGS YET
I'M CONSIDERING GETTING INTO BOTH

THERE ARE TOO MANY LOAR EXPANSIONS FOR ME TO EVER OWN THEM ALL THE GAMES LOOK TO HAVE VERY DIFFERENT FEELS

LOAR TO ME IS MORE OF A CO-OP MTG STYLE GAME WHEREAS MARKHAM LOOKS LIKE MORE OF AN RPG NARRATIVE STYLE GAME HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY PLAY MARKHAM YET BUT I THINK I'LL BE HANGING ONTO THE LOAR STUFF WHEN I GET AROUND TO IT
FOR ME IT WAS GREAT THE THEMING AND HOW IT WORKS INTO THE RULES IS BRILLIANT

JUST HAVING THE CORE SET MIGHT BE A BIT SPARSE ALTHOUGH I HAD A LOT OF PLAYS OUT OF IT BUT YOU ALSO DON'T NEED ALL THE EXPANSIONS TO HAVE SOME FUN OUT OF IT

I'VE REALLY ENJOYED THE SAGA EXPANSION WHICH FOLLOW THE HOBBIT AND LORD OF THE RINGS BOOKS AND ADD COOL CAMPAIGN RULES PERSISTENT UPGRADES AND DANGERS ACROSS PLAYS

FOR MORE INFO SEE HERE AND LOOK FOR THE SAGA EXPANSIONS
HOW MUCH DO YOU ENJOY THE THEME VS MARKHAM THEME
YEAH IT IS VERY WORTH IT LOTS OF EXPANSIONS AVAILABLE SO YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHERE YOU WANT TO QUEST NEXT AFTER THE CORE SET
VERY WORTH IT THE FIRST CYCLE ISN'T THE BEST THEY BECAME A LOT MORE ADVENTUROUS WITH THEIR DESIGN IN LATER CYCLES BUT IT DOES HAVE A LOT OF DECENT PLAYER CARDS THAT WILL HELP IN DECK BUILDING THEN JUST GET THE HOBBIT FELLOWSHIP SAGA BOXES IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE IN TO
I KNOW A LOCAL GUY SELLING LIKE WORTH OF STUFF FOR IT'S EVERYTHING THROUGH JUST AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND ON THE USED MARKET IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THAT LOT THOUGH I COULD CONNECT YOU TO HIM MY VIEW ON IT IS THAT SINCE IT'S AN ADVENTURE CARD GAME BUYING IN NOW JUST MEANS YOU'LL NEVER RUN OUT OF THINGS TO PLAY
I'VE NOT PLAYED OR EVEN LOOKED AT MARKHAM HORROR SO I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT GAME OR ANY POSSIBLE SIMILARITIES TO THE LOAR CG

I CAN SAY THAT I STARTED PLAYING THE LOAR CG IN AND FIND IT TO BE A GREAT GAME THE GAMEPLAY ITSELF HAS A VERY STRONG QUESTING ACCOMPLISHING FEEL AND IT FITS THE THEME VERY WELL IN THAT THE GAME ISN'T ALL ABOUT FIGHTING AND KILLING I WOULD AGREE WITH EVERYONE HERE IN THAT THE GAME IS ALWAYS BEING RUMORED TO BE ENDING OR WHATNOT IT SEEMS EVERY TIME FFA PUTS OUT A NEW PRODUCT PEOPLE THINK THAT MARKS THE END OF LOAR THAT'S JUST NOT PROVEN TO BE TRUE

RIGHT NOW THERE ARE A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF EXPANSIONS TO GET AND SOME CAN BE HAD AT REALLY CHEAP PRICES ON CLEARANCE I'VE FOUND THAT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING OF USE IN EACH EXPANSION SO EVEN THE CLEARANCE ONES CAN GET YOU SOME GOOD MATERIAL
I OWN JUST ABOUT EVERY LOAR CG EXPANSION INCLUDING THE NIGHTMARE AND POD STUFF AND I AM FIRMLY IN THE CAMP OF LOAR CG BEING BEST CG PRODUCT THE MODEL FITS PERFECTLY FOR IT AND THERE ARE A TON OF DECK BUILDING OPTIONS JUST IN THE CORE BOX THERE IS A GOOD VARIETY TO THE QUESTS HOWEVER IF REALLY FEEL THE NEED TO HAVE EVERYTHING IT'S GOING TO COST YOU A BIT THANKFULLY FFA HAS DONE REPRINTS OF THE EARLIER CYCLES IN THE LAST MONTHS SO NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO BUY IN IF YOU WANT TO DO EVERYTHING IN ORDER IF YOU ARE GETTING ANOTHER CORE SET AND THE FIRST CYCLE ON THE CHEAP PULL THE TRIGGER NOW YOU CAN ALWAYS RESELL

FROM A GAMEPLAY PERSPECTIVE LOAR CG AND MARKHAM CG SHARE A FEW THINGS MECHANICALLY PART OF HAVING A DESIGNER CROSS OVER BUT MARKHAM IS MUCH MORE LIKE PLAYING MARKHAM ELDRITCH HORROR IN A DISTILLED CARD FORMAT IT IS VERY VERY GOOD BUT NOT NEARLY AS WIDE OPEN AS LOAR PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE DECK BUILDING RESTRICTIONS ON CHARACTERS

LOAR ALSO PLAYS DIFFERENTLY YOU PUT MANY MORE CARDS ON THE BOARD COMPARED TO MARKHAM WHERE YOU MIGHT END UP USING CARDS FOR ONE-OFF SKILL CHECK TESTS ADDITIONALLY YOU DO A LOT MORE MATHEMATICAL CALCULATION IN LOAR COMPARED TO MARKHAM FINALLY IN LOAR YOU ARE LIMITED ONLY BY THE CARDS YOU CAN PLAY WHERE IN MARKHAM YOU ARE LIMITED MORE BY THE ACTIONS PER TURN RULE OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE CARDS THAT WORK AROUND THIS BUT IN GENERAL ON A TURN YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO DO THINGS

IN SUMMARY LOAR CG IS COMPARABLE TO MORE OF A COMPETITIVE CARD GAME LIKE NETRUNNER MAGIC GOT ETC WHERE MARKHAM CG IS MUCH MORE OF AN RPG LIKE EXPERIENCE DONE IN A BOTH ARE VERY GOOD GAMES AND IF YOU CAN GET BOTH I WOULD RECOMMEND IT

I REALLY LIKE IT BUT THATS BECAUSE IT SCRATCHES A DECK BUILDING ITCH WHILE BEING COOPERATIVE THE SETTING AND HOW THE MECHANICS TIE INTO THE THEME HELPS TOO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED I JUST PUT A REVIEW UP ON MY SITE THE CARDBOARD HERALD HERE'S THE LINK
REVIEWS
NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE THEME BUT LOVING IT SO FAR PLAYING IT AT THE SAME TIME AS MARKHAM HORROR CG NO REGRETS CURRENTLY PLOWING THROUCH THE SECOND CYCLE HAS A GREAT MIX OF STRATEGIC PLANNING AND TACTICS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GREAT SOLO GAME TO INVEST YOURSELF IN THEN I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER

ONE NOTE INSTEAD OF BUYING A SECOND OR THIRD CORE HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MAKING PROXIES OF ALL THE CARD PLIES YOU WANT I SCANNED ALL THE CARDS AND PRINTED COPIES ON PAPER AT STAPLES AND THE RESULTS ARE PRETTY GOOD COST TO PRINT ALL THE CARDS I WANTED WHICH IS MUCH MORE PALATABLE THAN FOR TWO EXTRA CORES
FOR ME GAMEPLAY WAS GOOD ALTHOUGH WHEN I BEAT QUEST I DIDN'T FEEL NEED TO REPLAY THAT AND GO BEAT IT AGAIN DECK BUILDING WAS BORING PART TOOK MORE TIME THAN ACTUAL GAMING DID SO ME AND MY F BASICALLY MADE SOME DECKS WE FOUND ONLINE AND PLAYED ALMOST ALL MISSIONS WITH THEM
ALL IN ALL IT WAS GOOD PURCHASE SINCE I SOLD IT FOR THE PRICE BECAUSE I GOT IT FOR SOMETHING LIKE OF THE ORIGINAL PRICE
LOOK FOR 2ND HAND SETS YOU CAN GET THEM FOR SOMETHING LIKE DISCOUNT USUALLY NOT WORTH FULL RETAIL TSH
I PLAYED THIS GAME IN ORDER OF QUESTS RELEASED UP TO AND INCLUDING THE FIRST QUEST OF THE FIRST DELUXE EXPANSION I LOVED IT THE FIRST WEEK I PLAYED IT BUT NOW NOT SO MUCH I FIND MYSELF MENTALLY EXHAUSTED AFTER A GAME BECAUSE THE NATURE OF THE GAME REQUIRES YOU KEEP ALL THE VARIABLES IN YOUR HEAD AT ALL TIMES IN ORDER TO SUCCEED EVERY ROUND YOU'RE COUNTING UP ALL YOUR STATS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY CHARACTERS YOU SHOULD COMMIT TO QUEST WHILE STILL HAVING PEOPLE TO BLOCK AND ATTACK TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE SPECIAL ABILITIES PLUS YOU'RE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANCE I THINK AT THIS POINT IN TIME I PLAY GAMES TO RELAX AS OPPOSED TO PLAY GAMES TO BE MENTALLY STIMULATED TO THE MAX SO IF THATS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS A GREAT GAME

PIGGYBACKING ON THIS THREAD ANYONE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH PLAYING NOTHING BUT THE CORE SET OR TWO AND THE SAGA EXPANSIONS

I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS GAME BUT DON'T WANT TO DIVE INTO THE DEEP END WITH A MILLION ADVENTURE PACKS I MAY GET THERE SOMEDAY SINCE I'VE SAID ROUGHLY THE SAME THING ABOUT SEVERAL OTHER FFA CGS BUT FOR NOW I'D LIKE TO KEEP IT SMALL AND STICK TO THE DELUXE BOXES AROUND THE LORD OF THE RINGS SAGA

WILL I STILL HAVE A GOOD TIME PLAYING WILL MISSING THOSE KEY META CARDS FROM THE APS MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO COMPLETE SAGA EXPANSION MISSIONS
I FOUND THE RULES A LITTLE OVERLY COMPLICATED FOR WHAT THE GAME WAS THE BASE SET ALSO SEEMED TO BE VERY LACKING IN CONTENT AND WHILE YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP UP WITH A META THE PRESSURE ON BUYING MORE JUST TO MAKE A DECK THAT LETS YOU FEEL CAPABLE AT THE GAME PUT ME OFFICIAL TRADED IT AWAY
I DIDN'T LIKE LOAR CG AT ALL

I BOUGHT THE BASE SET KHAZAR DUM AND THE FIRST TWO ADVENTURE PACKS

I FOUND THE GAME INCREDIBLY BORING
GREAT THEME GREAT ARTICLE BORING GAME PLAY

I TRADED MY SET IN FOR STORE CREDIT COULDN'T GET RID OF IT FAST ENOUGH
I WOULD SAY NO ONLY TO TELL YOU TO BUY INTO STAR WARS DESTINY INSTEAD
YOUR BEST BET FOR LOW VOLUME PRINTING IS PROBABLY A LASER CUTTER YOU MIGHT TRY BLUE PANTHER LLC THEY ARE PROVIDING PRINT ON DEMAND SERVICES FOR VICTORY POINT GAMES AND HOLLANDSPIELE
I'VE BEEN WATCHING AND HOPING THAT YOU'D HIT THE TARGET I CAN'T PLEDGE NOW BUT I HOPE THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO GET A COPY LATER LOOKS LIKE IT'LL BE FUN WHEN MY IS A LITTLE OLDER
SO EXCITED AND HUMBLED BY THE SUPPORT I HAVE GOTTEN I AM HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
MAN THE D BOARD AND NEON PIECES ARE SUPER
FOR THOSE NOT FOLLOWING THE LINK

BUT THE BIGGEST TWIST YOU LL FIND IN THIS VERSION OF THE GAME IS THAT NO ONE ACTUALLY DIES INSTEAD OF SOLVING A MURDER BY FIGURING OUT WHO THE KILLER WAS WHAT WEAPON THEY USED AND WHERE THEY COMMITTED THE CRIME CLUE STAR WARS EDITION HAS PLAYERS TRYING TO ESCAPE THE SPACE STATION WITH A COPY OF THE DEATH STAR S PLANS

SO IT'S KIND OF A NEW GAME MUCH LIKE THE SURPRISINGLY DECENT RISK STAR WARS EDITION FROM
SEEMS INTERESTING BUT WHY ISN'T THIS A ROGUE ONE THEMED GAME ISN'T THE PLOT OF THAT MOVIE ABOUT STEALING THE PLANS TO THE DEATH STAR IT SEEMS IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FROM A PROMOTIONAL STANDPOINT AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME IT WOULDN'T SELL LIKE CRAZY
IT WAS LARKIN IN THE TRASH COMPACTOR WITH THE HYDROSPANNER

JUST DOESN'T HAVEN'T THE SAME RING TO IT
DOES THIS NOT YET HAVE A BG PAGE HOW CAN I ADD IT TO MY BG WISELIEST
FOR SOME REASON DARTH VADER IS HELPING HAN LEIA CHEWIE LUKE ESCAPE WITH THE PLANS FOR THE DEATH STAR

WHICH IS CLEARLY REVISIONIST HISTORY MANY BETHANKS DIED TO BRING US THIS INFORMATION WHY ARE THEY BEING REMOVED FROM HISTORY
I LIKE STAR WARS BUT IT'S GETTING A BIT THIN NOW DO WE REALLY NEED MORE STAR WARS THEMED GAMES
I SAW THIS AND HAD HIGH HOPES THAT IT WASN'T CLUE LIKE HOW STAR WARS RISK WAS BASICALLY A MASS MARKET VERSION OF QUEEN'S GAMBIT IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE CLUE ONLY WITH A STAR WARS THEME AND A 3D BOARD
I AS CLAUDE AND I WONDERED WHO WOULD KILL HAN SOLO IN THE HALL WITH A LIGHTSABER
MPH
IT WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE ODD TO ME THAT A GAME PLAYED BY KIDS UNDER HAS A HOMICIDE THEME
HOW CAN DARTH VADER BE WORKING AGAINST THE EMPIRE WTF

COULDN'T THEY GET ANOTHER CHARACTER FROM THE WORLD LIKE LANDO
ALDERMAN THE MILLENNIUM FALCON DONE
TWENTY BUCKS AT TOYS R US
ANYONE KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO A BLACK VERSION LIKE THEY DID FOR RISK
I SUPPOSE THE IDEA IS NOVEL BUT THIS COMES OFF AS AN EVEN MORE BLATANT CASH GRAB WON'T GO NEAR IT
SO YET AGAIN THEY ARE USING A POPULAR BOARD GAME NAME TO PROMOTE A GAME THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ORIGINAL I WOULD THINK THAT THE STAR WARS NAME ALONE WOULD BE ENOUGH DO YOU REALLY NEED TO SUBVERT THE RISK AND CLUE NAME BRAND
TAKE MY MONEY
IT WAS JAR JAR IN THE GARBAGE COMPACTOR WITH A BOWCASTER
I'M PRETTY SURE I ALREADY SAW THIS A FEW WEEKS AGO IN A TOYS R US BY DOWNTOWN LINE A UNLESS THEY ARE A TEST MARKET OR SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE A DEATH STAR THE ACTUAL DEATH STAR WAS A SPHERE AND MUCH MUCH BIGGER
AT WHAT POINT ARE THE CROSS OVER GAMES NO LONGER EVEN CONSIDERED THE ORIGINAL GAME

LIKE HOW MANY THINGS CAN BE CHANGED BEFORE ITS NOT EVEN CLUE ANYMORE

ALSO THE STAR WARS BRAND HAS BEEN SO DILUTED I DONT EVEN CARE ABOUT IT ANYMORE
YOU SURE IT'S NOT BETTER TO BUY FROM YOUR OWN COUNTRY THEN I LIVE IN EUROPE AND I NEVER FOUND DEAL THAT EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT BE CRAZY DISCOUNTED BUT ADD EXPENSIVE SHIPPING VAT ON TOP OF THAT AND SUDDENLY IT GETS SAME OR MORE EXPENSIVE COMPARED TO SAME ITEM IN MY LOCAL STORE
DO AMAZON RUN PROMOS DURING BLACK FRIDAY
MY FAGS HAS A BLACK FRIDAY SALE AND I PLAN TO SUPPORT THEM IT'S A TYPICAL OFF SALE FOR THEM NOT AS CHEAP AS ONLINE PURCHASES BUT I CAN'T BY A PLACE TO PLAY AND GATHER ONLINE FOR THE MONEY I WOULD SAVE ON GAMES
IT'S MADE OF WOOD USE WOOD GLUE LOL
GOHILA WOOD GLUE IS WHAT I CHOSE AND IT WORKS WELL I APPLIED IT WITH A PAINTBRUSH
WOOD GLUE OR WHITE GLUE SHOULD WORK
HAVE BUILT A LOT OF THESE ANY CLEAR DRYING WOOD GLUE IS FINE USE A COTTON BUD TO REMOVE ANY EXCESS
I USE WOOD GLUE AND A WET RAG TO DAB OFF THE EXCESS
I USE THIS A LOT IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE GAMING INSERT COMPANY YOU CAN GET IT AT MICHAELS AND HOBBY LOBBY

BOBO CRAFT GLUE


YEA PLASTIC CEMENT WORKS BY MELTING THE PLASTIC A TINY BIT NO PLASTIC OF THE RIGHT KIND NO STICKY
WOOD WHITE OR EVEN CA GLUE IN A PINCH
I USE TACKY GLUE I SCREWED UP ONCE AND HAD TO REMOVE A PIECE IT TOOK A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF FORCE TO PULL IT APART DEFINITELY CAN RECOMMEND IT
PLASTIC MODEL GLUE ISN'T ACTUALLY GLUE IT'S A CHEMICAL THAT MELTS THE PLASTIC SO THAT THE TWO PLASTIC PARTS BOND INTO ONE PIECE

WHAT YOU WANT IS PVA AKA WHITE GLUE OR WOOD GLUE IT'S AND BECOMES TRANSPARENT WHEN IT HAS DRIED
WOOD GLUE THAT DRIES CLEAR WHATEVER IS AVAILABLE AT YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE WILL BE JUST FINE
BIBLIOG IS A GAME I QUITE LIKE THAT CONTAINS AUCTIONING AND SOME BLUFFING IT IS ALSO AWESOME WITH 2 UNLIKE MOST AUCTIONING GAMES

ABOUT A GAME WHERE YOU WALK AROUND ON A BOARD HOW ABOUT PANDEMIC IT IS A GAME WHERE YOU AND FRIENDS WALK AROUND A BOARD TRYING TO CURE DISEASES AS FAST AS POSSIBLE NEED SOME PLANNING WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND CAN BE PUZZLE

IF YOU LIKE A MORE STRATEGY SETTING PERHAPS TRY QUANTUM PRETTY LIGHT EASY TO LEARN YOU ALSO MOVE ACROSS THE BOARD WITH YOUR DICE IN THAT GAME THOUGH YOU ALREADY HAVE SMALL WORLD

ARE YOU ALSO INTERESTED IN OTHER STYLES OF GAMES LIKE SAY WONDERS SPACE AMONG THE STARS LORDS OF WATERDEEP CAVEMEN STONE AGE OR A CITY BUILDING GAME
BEYOND BAKER STREET

VITICULTURE

EMPIRE LEGENDS

CARCASSONNE WE HAVE THE SOUTH SEAS SPINOFF

THE GAME

KINGSBURG

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY

LOTUS

POTION EXPLOSION

CLUE IS KINDA GREAT BY THE WAY THERE IS A VERSION THAT SUPPORTS 2 PLAYERS I HAVE IT BUT HAVEN'T TRIED THAT VARIANT YET
SOMEBODY ALREADY SAID PANDEMIC I'D LIKE TO ADD FORBIDDEN ISLAND IF YOU LIKE COOP GAMES VERY EASY TO LEARN AND ALWAYS A GOOD WARMUP GAME FOR US LESS THAN MIN OR BIG BOOK OF MADNESS ALTHOUGH THE FIRST TIME YOU PLAY THIS IT MIGHT TAKE A BIT LONG TO GET A HANDLE OF IT

AND ONE OF THE NEWER GAMES ANIS NOT COOP IS PRETTY GOOD WITH 2 PLAYERS AND ALSO FOR MORE WE PICKED THIS UP AT SPIEL THIS YEAR STILL NOT SORRY ABOUT IT HEHE
I JUST WATCHED A VIDEO ON JONGETSGAMES CHANNEL ABOUT DEEP SEA ADVENTURE AND IT COULD PERHAPS FIT FOR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
MOST WORKER PLACEMENT GAMES SEEM TO WORK WELL WITH 2 AND MORE AT LEAST FOR ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND LORDS OF WATERDEEP IS HER FAVORITE WE ALSO HAVE VITICULTURE WHICH SCALES SURPRISINGLY WELL

A GAME TO LOOK INTO IS ORLEANS IT'S IN THE SAME VEIN AS DOMINION EXCEPT YOU'RE BUILDING A BAG OF WORKERS THAT YOU DRAW FROM EVERY TURN INSTEAD OF A DECK THAT'S BEEN A SUCCESS FROM PAGE

CONCORDIA ALSO SCALES PRETTY WELL BECAUSE THERE'S 2 DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE BOARD LIKE SMALL WORLD DEPENDING ON NUMBER OF PLAYERS
I HAVE HAD MY EYE ON COUP FOR QUITE A WHILE IT LOOKS GREAT I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT LIMITED USE AS IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS BETTER WITH MORE PLAYERS

VITICULTURE LOOKS FANTASTIC BECAUSE I LOVE THE THEME I WATCHED A FEW VIDEOS AND IT SEEMS QUITE COMPLEX TO LEARN THOUGH WHICH PUT ME OFF SLIGHTLY
KEYFLOWER IS MY VOTE
THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTIONS SO FAR I HADN'T REALLY CONSIDERED CATAN TO BE HONEST IT LOOKS GREAT I'M INTERESTED IN ANY STYLES I LIKE QUICK SETUPS WITH AN ELEMENT OF FUN AND INTERACTION EG AUCTIONS BLUFFING STEALING FROM OPPONENTS WORKING TOGETHER TRADING ETC

I AM RESEARCHING ALL THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS
STONE AGE
VITICULTURE HAS PLAYER SCALING BUILT RIGHT ON TO THE GAME BOARD AND DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB AT IT WITHOUT DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE PLAY TIME OR HAVING SIGNIFICANT PLAYER DOWNTIME

IT'S REASONABLY EASY TO TEACH AS WELL
FOR PANDEMIC ALSO LORDS OF WATERDEEP WHICH SHOULD FEEL PLAY A LITTLE DIFFERENT AT THE VARIOUS PLAYER COUNTS TOO
ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR GAMES SIMILAR TO BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL FOR 2 OR MORE PLAYERS

I REALLY LIKE THE MYSTERY THEME AND ALSO THE PROCEDURAL TILE GENERATION
WHY HAS NO ONE MENTIONED COUP

IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY A BLUFFING GAME FOR 2 PLAYERS IT'S INCREDIBLY QUICK TO PLAY AND IT'S NOT HARD TO PICK UP IT IS MORE INTIMIDATING TO BLUFF WHEN PLAYING BUT THE GAME PLAYS IN PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT SAME WAY AT FIVE OR SIX

PLUS THERE'S A VERSION IN COUP REBELLION FOR THE AFICIONADOS WHO JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH
DELETED
TALISMAN
THE BUILDINGS WITH A HAND SYMBOL SYMBOLISE A STOPPING POINT ALONG THE TRAIL AT WHICH YOU CAN REFRESH YOUR HORSES GRAB A ROOM IN WHICH TO SHAVE AND SLEEP AND HAVE A DRINK AT THE SALON THE OWNERS OF THESE SMALL TOWNS GET PRETTY OFFENDED AT PEOPLE PASSING THROUGH WITHOUT PARTAKING OF THE SERVICES OFFERED THE HAZARDS REQUIRE YOU TO PAY FOR ASSISTANCE IN THEIR NAVIGATION FROM THE LOCALS OR FOR REPAIRS TO DAMAGE CAUSED BY THESE HAZARDS
2 BY PAYING FOR A HAZARD TILE YOU ARE PAYING THE LOCALS TO REMOVE THE HAZARD CLEARING THE FALLEN ROCK REDIVERTING THE RIVERS COUNTY
PEOPLE FROM KANSAS ARE KNOWN TO OVERPAY FOR COWS THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THEM YOU LOSE VP BECAUSE YOUR REPUTATION ISN'T SPREAD AS FAR AFIELD
YOU GET MONEY FOR SELLING COWS TO PEOPLE EN ROUTE
IT'S A HEAVY EURO GAME IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR PERFECT THEMATIC INTEGRATION YOU'RE SNIFFING UP THE WRONG TREE
THE BEST EXPLANATION I CAN THINK OF FOR 2 IS THAT YOU ARE PAYING SOMEONE TO CLEAR THE HAZARD
DEFINITELY GET HEROES MONSTERS COLLECTIONS
THATS REALLY UP TO YOU THE HEROES MONSTERS PACKS ADD MORE VARIETY AND HEROES THE CHAINS EXPANSION AND MIST EXPANSION ONLY ADD NEW ENEMIES AND TILES AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY ALSO ABOUT THE HEROES MONSTERS PACKS IS THAT THEY ARE BASICALLY THE FIRST EDITION MONSTERS HEROES JUST UPDATED SO IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU IF YOU WANT TO ADD MORE HEROES AND MONSTERS OR JUST MORE MONSTERS AND TILES
PLAYER HERE AS WELL RECENTLY PICKED UP CHAINS AND PLAYED AS DEBRA THE BATTLEMAGE BERSERKER AND HAD AN AMAZING TIME

THE HYBRID CLASSES ALLOW YOU TO REVISIT SOME NOT SO GOOD CHARACTERS
FOR PLAYERS H M PACKS ARE THE EASIEST RECOMMENDATION IN THE WORLD THAT SAID THE APP STILL DOESN'T TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF NEW MONSTERS AND SEEMS TO THINK DESCENT PLAYERS ARE ENAMORED WITH THE FLESH MOULDERS BUT I'M SURE THAT WILL IMPROVE WITH TIME

ASIDE FROM THE MONSTERS THE MAIN ADVANTAGES AN PLAYER WOULD GET FROM THE BIG AND EXPANSIONS ARE THE NEW HERO CLASSES AND NEW ITEMS IF YOU'RE PLAYING A LOT OF STANDALONE DELVES AS OPPOSED TO PLAYING CAMPAIGNS I THINK YOU'LL GET REALLY GOOD MILEAGE OUT OF NEW CLASSES
IF YOU DON'T USE THE OVERLORD I FEEL MOST OF CHAINS WOULD GO TO WASTE IF YOU REALLY REALLY WANT THE HYBRIDS THEN GO FOR IT
MY LIBRARY IN URBANA IL HAS A CIRCULATING GAME COLLECTION IF IT HELPS FOR SUGGESTING TITLES TO YOUR LIBRARY'S STAFF I KEEP A GEEKIEST UPDATED AT BG THAT INCLUDES THE CONTENTS UPDATED AS I LEARN ABOUT NEW THINGS
HOW DOES THE LIBRARY MAKE SURE THAT ALL GAME PIECES REMAIN WITH THE GAME BETWEEN RENTALS AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A SINGLE PIECE OR MORE IS INEVITABLY LOST I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MY LIBRARY DO THIS

ALSO DOES THE LIBRARY RESTRICT PATRONS BY MAKING SURE THE GAMES STAY ON PREMISE

SORRY SO MANY QUESTIONS

I KNOW MY FAGS HAS A LIBRARY BUT YOU HAVE TO PLAY THE GAMES THERE AND HONESTLY IT'S RATHER SAFE CONSIDERING THE RESPECT MOST PATRONS OF THAT STORE HAVE FOR TABLETOP GAMES
SACRAMENTO CA LIBRARY ALSO DOES THIS


THEIR SELECTION IS QUITE GOOD BUT ALMOST EVERYTHING IS CHECKED OUT AT ANY GIVEN TIME I GUESS BEING UTILIZED IS A GOOD THING
THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING LIKE AN INTERESTING CONCEPT UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE USER BASE I DON'T THINK THIS IS FEASIBLE IN MY AREA
THIS IS A GREAT SUGGESTION ADDITIONALLY SOME BOARD GAME CLUBS WILL LEND TITLES OUT TO THEIR TRUSTED MEMBERS I BORROWED A COPY OF PANDEMIC THIS WEEK TO CHECK IT OUT AND I'M HOPING TO BORROW CARCASSONNE AND CATAN THIS WEEKEND I HAVEN'T PLAYED EITHER OF THEM IN A VERY LONG TIME AND I HAVE SOME FRIENDS NEW TO THE HOBBY WHO'D LIKE TO TRY THEM OUT
NOT SURE ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES BUT IN THE UK I'VE NOTICED A LOT OF CHARITY SHOPS HAVE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT GAMES SELLING FOR REALLY CHEAP
I GUESS THE ONE RISK YOU MIGHT HAVE IS MISSING PIECES
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE LIBRARY IN BROOKLYN HAS GAMES
I RECOMMEND DOCTOR FAUST

MINIATURE PAINTING BASICS

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU DON'T GET DISCOURAGED BY MISTAKES PAINT CAN BE REMOVED LEARN FROM IT AND KEEP GOING FORWARD

ALSO LEARN TO USE WASHES ALSO CALLED GLAZES THEY ARE KNOWN AMONGST ALL MINIATURE PAINTERS I KNOW AS LIQUID TALENT EVEN A BAD MINI CAN LOOK OK WITH COLORS AND A WASH
USER FORASTERO

EXCELLENT CHANNEL IT'S TARGETED FOR BEGINNERS AND MOST OF THE ADVICE FOR THE PARTICULAR MODELS HE PAINTS CARRIES OVER TO PAINTING ANY MINI
YOU MIGHT GET MORE TRACTION HERE R MINIPAINTING
GET THE REAPER BEGINNER KIT OFF OF AMAZON GREAT WAY TO START
WASH IS LIFE DO A CRAPPY PAINTJOB PUT WASH EVERYWHERE DONE CHECK THE ARMY PAINTER TUTORIAL FOR THAT
THIN YOUR PAINTS
HEY I ACTUALLY STARTED PAINTING LAST WEEK IT'S A LOT EASIER THAN YOU'D IMAGINE OF YOU ONLY WANT TO PAINT THE MINIS WELL ENOUGH TO GET ON THE TABLE

A

THAT'S A SMALL ALBUM OF THE MINIS I'VE PAINTED THIS WEEK AND I USED SOME BASIC BEGINNER TECHNIQUES THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE

SHARED CI FPDJE

IT'S FUN SO FAR I'D RECOMMEND IT
BEEN PAINTING FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND I LOVE IT

A FEW GOOD LESSONS ALL ARE GOOD SEARCH TOPICS ON YOUTUBE

THIN YOUR PAINTS MOST IMPORTANT

LAYER UP ESPECIALLY ON YOUR LIGHTER COLORS YELLOWS ORANGES WHITES

LOOK UP THESE TECHNIQUES BASE COAT WASH DRYBRUSH HIGHLIGHTING BLENDING

READ UP ON YOUR COMPLIMENTARY COLORS AND SATURATION

OTHER THAN THAT GET AFTER IT DON'T GET DISCOURAGED BY HOW THE FIRST FEW MIGHT TURN OUT JUST CHALK IT UP AS LEARNING POST YOUR FIRST RESULTS OVER TO R MINIPAINTING ASKING FOR CC AND YOU'LL GET LOTS OF GOOD ADVICE

GOOD LUCK AND WELCOME TO THE HOBBY
HI THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD ADVICE YOU HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN SO I AM JUST GOING TO OFFER SOME GENERAL ADVICE

I JUST STARTED PAINTING ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND WHEN I STARTED I WASN'T VERY GOOD MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO JUST KEEP PAINTING ONCE YOU START IT RELAXES ME AND I REALLY ENJOY IT NOW I WATCHED A LOT OF YOUTUBE TUTORIALS AND LEARNED AS MUCH AS I COULD I ALSO STARTED WITH CHEAP PAINTS FROM AND BRUSHES BUT I UPGRADED LATER ONCE I WAS SURE I LIKED PAINTING

ALSO START WITH A GAME YOU DON'T CARE IF YOU DO MESS UP I STARTED WITH THE DUNGEONS DRAGONS CASTLE RAVENLOFT GAME AND MOVED ONTO CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD AND BLOOD RAGE ONCE I WAS CONFIDENT

I'M STILL NOT VERY GOOD BUT I LOVE LEARNING NEW TECHNIQUES AND TRYING TO IMPROVE ALL OF THE TIME

GOOD LUCK
SURE

WATERDEEP BUT I'M NOT THE BEST PM ME
YES
IS THIS A QUESTION
I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE WHY PLAY VAMPIRES THEN MOST OF THE GAME IN ONUS IS THE MARKS VAMPIRES GIVE A MARK TO ANOTHER PLAYER MAKING THEM A VAMPIRE TOO IF YOU TAKE OUT THE MARKS THEN THEY'RE JUST WEREWOLVES YOU MAY AS WELL JUST PLAY ONUS DAYBREAK
ONUS ROCKS MANUAL I DEF PREFER IT OVER ONUS ANY ARTIC REASON YOU DON'T WANT TO USE MARKS

JUST GETTING KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAME UNDERWAY MAKING SURE PEOPLE ENJOY IT
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE RHUBARB
SET IS A GREAT GAME ABOUT PATTERN MATCHING TAKES A WHILE TO GET GOOD AT IT THOUGH AND MIGHT NOT BE GOOD FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE OR PEOPLE NOT LOOKING FOR REALLY CHINKY GAMES

INCAN GOLD IS AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND PRESS YOUR LUCK GAME THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL PICK UP NO PROBLEM

COUP AND SKULL WORK GREAT IF THE PLAYERS ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE RULES AS EXPLAINED SKULL MIGHT TAKE ONE GAME OF PLAY BEFORE PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO

ULTIMATE WARRIOR IS MY CHOICE IF READING IS POOR AND YOU WANT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO KING OF TOKYO I ACTUALLY PREFER ULTIMATE WARRIOR MORE THAN KOT

NO THANKS AND SIX DIMMIT ARE REALLY GREAT AND SHOULDN'T CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS FOR THE SPECIFICS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

LIAR'S DICE IS A CLASSIC AND EASY TO PUT TOGETHER PLUS IT WAS FEATURED IN PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN SO SOMEONE MIGHT RECOGNIZE IT

HEY THAT'S MY FISH FOR THE SILLY FUN BUT FAIRLY EASY STRATEGY IF YOU WANT IT
NO THANKS CONTAINS CARDS NUMBERED AND CHIPS

PLAYS HAS THESE RULES

AIM

TO HAVE THE LEAST POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME CHIPS ARE WORTH AND CARDS ARE WORTH NUMBER ON THEM

SET UP

GIVE EACH PLAYER THEIR CHIPS FOR PLAYERS FOR AND FOR

SHUFFLE DECK AND DISCARD CARDS WITHOUT SHOWING THEM

PLAY

ACTIVE PLAYER FLIPS OVER THE TOP CARD AND DECIDES WHETHER TO TAKE IT OR NOT

IF THEY TAKE IT THEY PLACE IT FACE UP IN FRONT OF THEM WITH ANY CHIPS ON IT AND REPEAT THE ABOVE

IF THEY DECIDE NOT TO TAKE IT THEY PLACE A CHIP FROM THEIR SUPPLY ON THE CARD AND PLAY PASSES TO THE NEXT PLAYER WHO DECIDES WHETHER TO TAKE OR PASSIVE A PLAYER WITHOUT ANY CHIPS WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE CARD

REPEAT UNTIL ALL CARDS HAVE BEEN PLAYED

TOTAL UP SCORES WITH RUNS OF NUMBERS ONLY COUNTING THEIR LOWEST SCORE EX WOULD COUNT AS

LOWEST SCORE WINS PLAY CAN CONTINUE OVER MULTIPLE ROUNDS UNTIL AN AGREED HIGH SCORE HAS BEEN REACHED
GET BIT SOUNDS APPROPRIATE
THE OLD CLASSIC GUILLOTINE MIGHT WORK PRETTY SIMPLE TAKE THAT MECHANIC BUT IT'S NOT REALLY THAT MEAN YOU'RE TRYING TO COLLECT SETS OF CARDS OF DIFFERENT COLORS ALL WORTH POINTS THE CARDS PLAYERS USE ALLOW THEM TO REARRANGE THE CARDS AND EITHER TAKE A CARD THEY WANT FROM THE FRONT OR PUSH A CARD TO THE REAR IT'S VERY INTERACTIVE AND GOOFY

THAT'S REALLY THE MOST SIMPLE WAY TO EXPLAIN IT BUT THE THEME MAKES IT LIGHT HEARTED AND FUN YOU'RE RIVAL EXECUTIONERS TRYING TO CAPTURE THE BEST HEADS OF NOBLES DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION
HOW MANY PEOPLE LOVE LETTER AND COUP ARE QUICK ROLL FOR IT PERHAPS
NO THANKS QUICK CARD GAME WITH NUMBERS EASY RULES QUICK TO PLAY INTERESTING STRATEGY NO TEXT

DAYS IN EUROPE USA AFRICA ASIA OR THE AMERICAS BE THE FIRST TO CREATE A COMPLETE TRAVEL ROUTE THERE ARE VERSIONS FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD GREAT GAME THAT PLAYS WELL WITH AND EACH ROUND IS SHORT MINUTES SO YOU CAN PLAY MULTIPLE TIMES IN A ROW IT'S ABOUT DRAWING AND REPLACING CARDS IN A RACK SO THAT YOU HAVE A FULLY CONNECTED TRIP BETWEEN COUNTRIES A LITTLE BIT LIKE RUMMY AND A LOT LIKE AN OLD GAME CALLED NO TEXT EXCEPT THE NAMES OF COUNTRIES

CAN'T STOP FUN FAST GAME NO TEXT

CARTAGENA RACING PIRATES ALONG A PATH BY PLAYING CARDS WITH A CLEVER MOVEMENT MECHANISM NO TEXT


INGENIOUS VISUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING STRATEGICALLY EASY RULES SCALES WELL SHOULD BE GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE ABSTRACT GAMES NO TEXT AT ALL

COLORETTO SIMPLE RULES INTERESTING SET COLLECTION AND STRATEGIES NO TEXT GOOD BLEND OF STRATEGY AND LUCK
ZOMBIE DICE IS VERY SIMPLE AND QUICK

ANOTHER GOOD ONE COULD BE EXPLODING KITTENS AN EASY CARD GAME WHERE THE GOAL IS TO NOT PLAY AN EXPLODING KITTEN CARD
THANKS EVERYONE
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING ZEUS ON THE LOOSE AT FAMILY THINGS JUST BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO PICK IT UP AT VALUE VILLAGE SIMPLE CARD GAME WITH A BIT OF TAKE THAT ETUDE SUSHI GO IS ALSO EASY TO LEARN BUT INTERESTING AND A NEW MECHANIC FOR MOST CARD DRAFTING WITHOUT BEING TOO COMPLICATED OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME FOR FAMILY EVENTS ARE DIXIT OR MYSTERIUM CODENAMES ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF
DIMMET IT MEANS TAKE

DECK OF CARDS NUMBERED FROM TO THERE ARE CARDS ON THE BOARD AND EVERYONE GETS A HAND OF YOU ALL PICK A CARD REVEAL THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY AND PLAY THEM FROM LOWEST TO HIGHEST

AS YOU PLAY A CARD YOU PLACE IT IN THE ROW IT IS CLOSEST TO WITHOUT GOING UNDER EG THE FIRST CARDS ARE AND YOU PLAY A AND IT GOES NEXT TO THE IF YOUR CARD IS LOWER THAN ALL THE LAST CARDS IN ALL ROWS YOU REPLACE AN ENTIRE ROW WITH YOUR CARD AND TAKE THE ROW TO YOUR SCORE PILE

IF YOUR CARD IS THE 6TH CARD IN A ROW YOU REPLACE THE ROW WITH YOUR CARD AND ADD IT TO YOUR SCORE PILE HENCE TAKE

REPEAT UNTIL ALL CARDS ARE GONE

SCORING IS SIMPLE EACH CARD HAS A NUMBER OF MOOSE HEADS ON IT YOU WANT TO HAVE THE LEAST MOOSE HEADS IN YOUR SCORE PILE

PLAYS PLAYERS EASILY BOX SAYS MINS BUT I'VE HAD MULTIPLE GAMES WITHIN MINS

LITERALLY ALL YOU NEED TO READ IS THE LARGE NUMBER ON THE CARD THE MOOSE HEAD VALUES ARE EASILY DIFFERENTIATED BY COLOUR TOO
ISLE OF SKYE AND ISTANBUL ARE MEDIUM HEAVY EUROS THAT ARE PLAYABLE UNDER HANSA TEUTONIA IS A LITTLE HEAVIER AND ALSO PLAYABLE IN OF COURSE IF PLAYERS DO NOT HAVE SEVERE AP
GAMES AND THE PLAYER COUNTS THAT THEY PLAY UNDER AN HOUR WITH ASSUMING PLAYERS KNOW THE GAME

SIMILAR ENGINE BUILDING TO ROLLFTG MINS PER PLAYER AND JUST A REAL CLASSIC GAME
HARBOUR SEEMS LIKE A GOOD CHOICE HERE QUANTUM GOLD WEST CAPITAL ARCANE ACADEMY

MOTTAINAI

GHOST STORIES

FIVE TRIBES IF NO ONE HAS AP
IT TYPICALLY COMES DOWN TO PLAYER COUNT SOME THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLETE IN AN HOUR WITH PLAYERS INCLUDE

WORLDS FAIR SHARP LITTLE WORKER PLACEMENT AREA CONTROL GAME

VIA NEBULA FANTASY THEMED ROUTE BUILDING PICKUP AND DELIVER GAME ABOUT REBUILDING A VILLAGE

PALACES OF CARRARA MECHANICALLY STRAIGHT FORWARD BUT CHINKY GAME THAT HAS YOU DECIDING BETWEEN BUYING BRICKS BUILDING BUILDINGS AND SCORING YOUR BUILDINGS

ROYALS FANTASTIC AREA CONTROL GAME THAT PLAYS
SAIL TO INDIA IS A GREAT CHOICE HERE

IT'S A CUBE MANAGEMENT GAME AS YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF WORKERS WHO COULD REPRESENT YOUR SHIPS MONEY AND VICTORY POINTS
THE ANCIENT WORLD IS A GORGEOUS WORKER PLACEMENT GAME THAT GET MUCH BUZZ IT IS SET IN A FICTIONAL WORLD WHERE YOU HAVE TO COLLECT THE FAVORS OF DIFFERENT TRIBES BY EITHER BUILDING DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTIONS OR SEND ARMIES TO SLAY THE LOCAL TITANS
IMHOTEP IS A FUN GAME THAT EASILY PLAYS IN UNDER AN HOUR

SANTIAGO DE CUBA WOULD ALSO MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS
I MAY REPEAT SOME ALREADY FOUND HERE BUT HERE ARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS

GOLD WEST
DISCOVERIES
WORLD'S FAIR
PORT ROYAL
I THINK ONE RULE I GOT WRONG THE FIRST TIME OR TWO WAS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE TO GET PAPERS FOR YOUR COUSINS YOU GET ALL OF THEM UP UNTIL THE CURRENT ROUND NOT JUST THE NEXT ONE COUSIN
ANY IMPS YOU SEND TO THE PODIUM STAY THERE SO IF YOU USE THAT ACTION WITH TWO IMPS YOU DON'T GET BACK EITHER OF THEM

OFTEN I SEE PEOPLE CHOOSE TO DO THAT ACTION WITH TWO IMPS AND THEN TAKE BACK ONE OF THEM AT THE END OF THE ROUND NOPE THEY BOTH STAY UNTIL USED
WHEN ONE PET RETIRES FROM THE OLDER PET BOARD YOU ADD A MEAT TO THE MEAT STAND YOU TOTALLY CHOP HIM IN PIECES REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE MANUAL SAYS

THE MINIONS IN THE SELLING PLATFORM STAY THERE UNTIL THEY ARE USED

A MINION GROUP DOESN'T HAVE TO GO YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND AND LET THEM STAY

FOOD DOESN'T ACCUMULATE

REMEMBER THAT FRESHLY BOUGHT MINIONS CAN'T BE SOLD ALSO THEY ALWAYS GROW UP BY 2 YEARS LEVELS IN THE NEXT ROUND AFTER THEY WERE BOUGHT IN THE PREVIOUS ONE
BE SURE TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT ALL NEEDS CARDS ARE SPENT FOR EACH NEED REQUIRED AND THAT YOU HAVE THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF CARDS LEFT OVER AFTER NEEDS ARE MET

POTIONS CAN GOOF THIS UP AS YOU NEED TO DISCARD THE NEED YOU ARE REPLACING WITH THE POTION

I HAVE PLAYED A FEW GAMES WHERE SOMEONE WILL SUDDENLY EXCLAIM HOW COME I HAVE EXTRA NEEDS CARDS
WHEN YOU SELL A PET YOU CAN USE AN IMP THAT'S STANDING ON THE PODIUM TO BOOST THE VP GAINS FROM TO HOWEVER THIS CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE ON THE FINAL ROUND DESPITE THERE BEING TWO DUNGEON LORDS AVAILABLE TO SELL TO
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING A LOOK AT STEEPLE LIKE US HETP THEY DO GREAT REVIEWS FOCUSED ON ACCESSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WITH CONDITIONS LIKE COLOR BLINDNESS MAY BE A GOOD RESOURCE FOR FUTURE PURCHASES
WELL THERE IS THE OCCASIONAL POST HERE WHERE PEOPLE ANALYZE BOARDGAMES IN REGARDS TO ACCESSABILITY THESE POSTS HAVE ENTRIES FOR THE COLORBLIND AS WELL

BUT THE EXAMPLES YOU GAVE US FOR THE STUFF YOUR DAD LIKES ARENT SUPER HELPFUL SINCE YOU WROTE THAT HE LIKES FPS AND THAT IS A GENRE IMPOSSIBLE TO BOARDGAMES

I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST TO TRY CODENAMES IT IS REALLY ACCESSABLE DOESNT HAVE MANY GAME PIECES AND IS GREAT FUN IF THE COLOURS RED BLUE ARE AN ISSUE YOU COULD REPLACE THE BLOCKER CARDS WITH ONES BETTER SUITED FOR HIS COLORBLINDNESS
DEAD OF WINTER AND FURY OF DRACULA ARE GOOD GAMES THAT DO NOT RELY ON COLOUR AT ALL

FOR SOMETHING LIGHTER YOU COULD TRY SUSHI GO COUP LOVE LETTER OR GLOOM GLOOM HAS A DIFFERENT COLOUR FOR EACH FAMILY BUT THIS HAS NO GAMEPLAY EFFECT APART FROM IDENTIFYING THEM DURING SETUP AND CAN BE IGNORED
KING OF TOKYO NEW YORK BOTH REQUIRE NO COLOURS AND ARE LIGHT GATEWAY GAMES


WELL KILLER BUNNIES SUCKS IF HE LIKES WAR GAMES WHERE HE CAN TAKE HIS TIME BUT ARE ALSO ACTION GAMES MAYBE HE'D LIKE MINIATURES I DON'T THINK COLOR IS A BIG DEAL ATTACK DICE ARE RED AND DEFENSE DICE ARE GREEN BUT JUST ROLL THEM IN DIFFERENT SPOTS AND NO WORRIES PLUS THERE'S ONLY SHARED SYMBOL ON THEM SO EASY TO TELL THEM APART ANYWAY SMALL WORLD IS A FUN QUICK MOVING AREA CONTROL GAME THAT WHILE A VERY COLORFUL GAME IN GENERAL DOESN'T USE COLOR IN ANY WAY FOR DISTINGUISHING PLAYERS OR PLAYER TOKENS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
FOR ABSTRACT STRATEGY I RECOMMEND INGENIOUS THE COLORED PIECES ARE EXPLICITLY DESIGNED WITH SYMBOLS SO THAT COLORBLIND FOLKS ARE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE PIECES
IF HE HAS EVEN A REMOTE LIKING FOR CHESS HOW ABOUT ONITAMA
QWIRKLE

I HATE THE COLOURS IN IT
HIVE SHOULD BE FINE KAHUNA LIE DIXIT BANG THE DICE GAME JAMAICA FORBIDDEN DESERT SAMURAI SPIRIT SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM SUSHI GO TIDES OF OF OPTIONS
PATCHWORK IT'S TERRIS AND A LIGHT BIT OF ECON DENIAL ODD THEME BUT HAS SOME SOLID LEGS
I WOULD RECOMMEND PATCHWORK FOR 2 REASONS

FIRST IT IS AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE GAME FOR I INTRODUCED IT TO MY SISTER AND MOTHER LAST WEEK END AND THE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT WHILE NOT BEING USED TO BOARDGAMES

I THINK IT SHOULD BE OK FOR COLORBLIND SINCE THE GAME REVOLVES AROUND SHAPES RATHER THAN COLORS WHO CARES ABOUT HAVING A NICE PATCHWORK AS LONG AS YOU WIN MAYBE JUST HELP HIM TRACK WHICH PAWN IS HIS OR YOU COULD MARK ONE WITH A PEN TO DIFFERENTIATE THE 2
TICKET TO RIDE MIGHT BE A FIT WITH SYMBOLS ON THE CARDS TO MARK THE DIFFERENT COLORS
I'D SUGGEST TICKET TO RIDE
OUR ONE OF OUR AGS OWNERS IS COLORBLIND AND LIKES FIVE TRIBES DUE TO ITS COLOR SCHEME
WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT KINDS OF THINGS HE MIGHT ENJOY IT'S HARD TO SUGGEST A GAME CARDS STRATEGY WORKER PLACEMENT OR DO YOU JUST WANT GATEWAY GAMES THAT WORK FOR SOMEONE WHO IS COLORBLIND

HIVE WOULD WORK TICKET TO RIDE EUROPE WOULD WORK HANAFI FAIRY TALE I HAVE ALL THOSE AND CAN VOUCH FOR SYMBOLS IN ADDITION TO COLORS JAIPUR AND LOST CITIES MIGHT ALSO WORK I HAVEN'T LOOKED TO CLOSELY AT THOSE CARDS BUT I BELIEVE ALL THE COLORS HAVE DIFFERENT DESIGNS

ONE OF THE ZOMBICIDE GAMES MIGHT BE A GOOD PLACE TO START IT IS A CO-OP GAME WITH SCENARIOS AND IT ISN'T THAT DIFFICULT TO LEARN
MY GAME GROUP HAS 2 PEOPLE WITH COLOR BLINDNESS WE HAVE LEARNED TO DESCRIBE THE COLORS OR NOT USE CERTAIN COLOR PLAYER PIECES ON SOME GAMES WHERE IT IS HARD TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEM MOST GAMES NOW HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND ADDED SYMBOLS ALONG WITH THE COLOR TO HELP BUT ON SOME OTHERS WE ADDED DOTS OR SOME OTHER MARK TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE AS LONG AS THE GROUP IS AWARE IT CAN BE OVERCOME WITH VERY LITTLE EFFORT MOST OF THE TIME OF COURSE THERE HAS BEEN A FEW GAMES THAT MAY JUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WE JUST CHOOSE ANOTHER GAME IT HELPS THAT ONE OF THE GUYS WITH THE COLORBLINDNESS HAS THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF US ALL AND PICKS A LOT OF OUR GAMES IN SHORT IF THE GROUP IS UNDERSTANDING AND THE COLORBLIND INDIVIDUAL IS NOT SHY ABOUT ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE WHEN NEEDED IT NORMALLY IS NOT AN BIG DEAL
DO YOU HAVE A GROUP YOU PLAY REGULARLY WITH I THINK IT'S EASIER TO SHOW PEOPLE HOW FUNNY GAMES CAN BE WHEN PLAYING AT GROUPS INSTEAD OF TWO PLAYER GAMES
SCYTHE IS A COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY GAME WITH GREAT SOLO PLAY SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE RIGHT UP HIS ALLEY
TICKET TO RIDE HAS COLORS AND SHAPES FOR EACH OF THE TRAINS THE I KG ISSUE MIGHT BE HE COULD MIX UP EACH PLAYERS PIECES UNLESS YOU GET THE ANNIVERSARY EDITION OR SOMEHOW LABEL HIS PROBLEM COLORS
I AM GOING TO RECOMMEND THE D D BOARD GAMES CASTLE RAVENLOFT WRATH OF ASHERDALON LEGEND OF DRIZZLE BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR DAD LIKES CAMPAIGN GAMES THESE GAMES ARE PRETTY LIGHT DUNGEON CRAWLERS AND ARE RELATIVELY CHEAP SO IF HE DOESN'T LIKE THEM THEN YOU AREN'T OUT TOO MUCH MONEY
I'M COLORBLIND AS WELL AND DO DECENTLY WELL WITH MOST GAMES THE ONLY GAME THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME AND IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE I REALLY ENJOY IT IS LORDS OF WATERDEEP THE BLACK AND PURPLE CUBES ARE TOO DAMN CLOSE IN COLOR
JUST BE READY TO ACCEPT THAT HE JUST MIGHT NOT LIKE BOARD GAMES OBVIOUSLY BEING COLOUR BLIND IS A BARRIER BUT MAYBE NOT THE BARRIER THAT'S ACTUALLY STOPPING THEM
TRY A GATEWAY GAME TICKET TO RIDE IS A GREAT STARTER GAME AND IS VERY COLORBLIND FRIENDLY AS ALL THE COLOURS USE SYMBOLS JUST LET HIM PICK PLAYER COLOUR FIRST

I'M PRETTY COLORBLIND MYSELF AND THERE AREN'T A LOT OF GAMES THAT I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH FOR MOST OF THEM THE COLOURS ARE OPEN INFORMATION SO I CAN DOUBLE CHECK IF NEEDED THE GENERAL POLICY IS AS I STATED BEFORE LET THE COLORBLIND PEOPLE PICK PLAYER COLOUR FIRST
CARCASSONNE WOULD PROBABLY WORK IF YOU CAN FIND THE COLORS OF MEEDLESS THAT ARE DIFFERENT ENOUGH FROM EACH OTHER I FIND THE BLUE AND GREEN ARE TOO SIMILAR IN BAD LIGHTING OR MARK SOME WITH DOTS OR SYMBOLS WITH A SHARPIE AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED
YOU HAVE PROVIDED VERY LITTLE PERTINENT INFORMATION

WHICH SPECTRUM OF COLOUR BLINDNESS IS HE AFFLICTED WITH AND HOW SEVERE IS IT DOES HE SHUT DOWN AT HAVING TO CONSTANTLY PROCESS COLOURS

HACK N SLASH AND FPS I WOULD OPINE ARE NOT GENRES YOU'D FIND IN MODERN BOARDGAMES ARE THERE ANY OTHER GENRES THAT INTEREST HIM

WHAT ARE HIS THOUGHTS ON BOARDGAMES APART FROM THINKING THEY'RE ALL SIMILAR TO MONOPOLY RISK LIFE DOES HE LIKE ANY ASPECT OF THEM OR HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM

I TOO AM COLOUR-BLIND RED GREEN DEFICIENCY THERE ARE VERY FEW GAMES BOARD OR VIDEO THAT ARE TOTALLY INACCESSIBLE AT A PUSH I WOULD SAY ONLY GRAND STRATEGY OR GAMES LIKE CIVILISATIONS WHERE HAVING TO CONSTANTLY PARSE INFORMATION VIA COLOUR TIRES ME OUT

BOARDGAMES ALLOW ME THE TIME TO COMFORTABLY PROCESS COLOURED INFORMATION BUT SO FAR APART FROM MONOPOLY DEAL I'VE NOT BEEN HAVING MUCH TROUBLE

PANDEMIC WOULD BE A GOOD STARTING POINT RED BLUE YELLOW BLACK CUBES FOR THE DISEASES NO OTHER DIFFERENTIATION NEEDED

THERE IS MORE CONTROL OVER GAMEPLAY SIMILAR TO GOW FPS WHEREBY TARGETS SPAWN IN RANDOM NUMBERS AT FIXED SPAWN POINTS AND PLAYERS HAVE TO DECIDE IN WHAT ORDER AND WITH WHICH APPROPRIATE SKILL CHOICE TO ELIMINATE SAID TARGETS

A DUNGEON CRAWL GAME LIKE ZOMBICIDE MAY HAVE SOME TENUOUS LINK TO DECISION-MAKING TARGETS CONSTANTLY SPAWNING PLAYERS CONSTANTLY REPOSITIONING AND SEARCHING FOR LOOT HEAVY SIMULATE HITTING MISSING THE TARGETS IN AN FPS THERE IS ALMOST NO REQUIREMENT FOR COLOUR DIFFERENTIATION CAVEAT I HAVE NOT PLAYED IT BUT ONLY BECAUSE I AM AWAITING MASSIVE DARKNESS WHICH IS SIMILAR ON GENRE

ANOTHER USER RECOMMENDED TICKET TO RIDE ANOTHER GAME I PERSONALLY DID NOT HAVE MUCH TROUBLE WITH AND ONE I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED ALTHOUGH THE BOARD MAY GET TOO COLOURFUL FOR YOUR DAD

IF THERE ARE CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF COLOURS THAT ARE IMPEDING YOUR FATHER'S ENJOYMENT AND THERE AREN'T ANY SYMBOLS SHAPES TO HELP YOU MIGHT WANT TO HELP LABEL THE OFFENDING BITS WITH SMALL STICKERS ETC

MY SO IS AWARE OF MY AND HELPS ME WITH STUFF LIKE THAT I HAVE A GROUP OF FRIENDS WHO LOVE MONOPOLY DEAL AND WHENEVER WE PLAY I REMIND THEM THAT I'M NOT TOO SAVVY WITH COLOURS AND WILL CONSTANTLY REAFFIRM CERTAIN COLOURS WITH THEM


DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF COLORBLINDNESS HAVE YOU SEEN THESE GLASSES

THEY APPLY COLOR FILTERS ON THE WAVELENGTHS TO BETTER SEPARATE THE RED GREEN SPECTRUM SO YOUR CONES TRIGGER SEPARATELY
TRY A HEAVIER GAME MANY PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE LIGHT GAMES AT ALL

I'D SUGGEST EMET POSEIDON OPHIR OR FOOD CHAIN MAGNATE
YOU'VE GIVEN US VERY LITTLE TO GO ON TWILIGHT STRUGGLE PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT COLOR IN THAT GAME
HONESTLY YOU WON'T HAVE ISSUES WITH OF MODERN GAMES

I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE THAT REALLY ENJOYS KILLER BUNNIES SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY TELL ME MUCH

YOU HAVE SOO MANY OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE DOMINION PANDEMIC SPACE ALERT TERRA MYSTIC
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED OR LOOKED INTO GETTING HIM A PAIR OF ENCHROMA GLASSES THEY ARE PRICEY AT ABOUT USD BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THEY CAN CORRECT COLOR BLINDNESS

EFFECTIVELY YOU'D BE GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO POSSIBLY ENJOY ANY GAME ALSO COLORS


CHESS
LOVE LETTER IS A CLASSIC
BANG CITADELS AND COUP ALL SEEM TO FIT YOUR REQUIREMENTS OF CHEAP FAST AND SCALABLE AND FUN TOO BUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S A GIVEN
ANOMIA WOULD FIT THE BILL PLAYERS FAST LOTS OF YELLING AND IT'S BEEN A HIT WITH OTHER STUDENTS FOR ME
FAST PACED I THINK LOVE LETTER IS THE STANDARD IN THAT CAN BE PLAYED QUICKLY BUT EXTEND OVER DOZENS OF HANDS TO TAKE UP A BIG CHUNK OF THE EVENING THE NEW PREMIUM EDITION CAN HANDLE UP TO PLAYERS

I'M ALSO INTERESTED TO TRY WISHES WHICH LOOKS TO HAVE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE PACE BUT DIFFERENT MECHANICS IT CAN HANDLE PEOPLE WHICH IS KIND OF LIMITING BUT DICE TOWER REVIEW REALLY INTRIGUED ME SINCE HE SPECIFICALLY SAID IT WAS BETTER THAN LOVE LETTER

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS LITERALLY FRANTIC YOU COULD GO WITH A REAL-TIME DICE GAME LIKE FUSE IT'S NOT A BUT IS DEFINITELY PORTABLE MINUTES IS THE HARD TIME LIMIT ON THE GAME OTHERWISE THE BOMBS GO OFF AND THE GAME IS OVER

IF THE PACE OF THE GAME ISN'T QUITE AS IMPORTANT AS I'M INTERPRETING I THINK SOCIAL DEDUCTION GAMES LIKE COUP RESISTANCE OR ONUS ARE PERFECT FOR MIXED GROUPS OF COLLEGE AGE PLAYERS COUP CAN PLAY AS LOW AS WHILE THE OTHERS NEED GROUPS OF OR MORE REALLY GENERALLY THESE ARE OVER IN MINUTES AND PEOPLE CAN JOIN IN AND LEAVE AS THEY LIKE BUT BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE DISCUSSION AND ATTENTION THEY'RE KIND OF DEPENDENT ON WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN THE ROOM
CHECK OUT SUSHI GO PARTY
FOR LOST LEGACY THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SETS AND WE USUALLY PUT TWO SETS TOGETHER WITH TWO SETS YOU CAN PLAY WITH PLAYERS
FOR ANOMIA SUSHI GO PARTY LOVE LETTER AND ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF ALSO CODENAMES DIXIT OR MYSTERIUM MAYBE MUNCHKIN FOR SOME RELATIVELY MINDLESS FUN CARCASSONNE FOR A LITTLE MORE THINKING BUT STILL RELATIVELY LIGHT ANY OF THE TINY EPIC SERIES HARBOUR COUP OR BANG THE DICE GAME
DOES ROLL FOR THE GALAXY COUNT BECAUSE IF SO ROLL FOR THE GALAXY
MINE IS STILL TINY EPIC GALAXIES

IF YOU COUNT CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AS A DICE GAME THEN PROBABLY IT'S COB
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AND PANDEMIC THE CURE
LAS VEGAS

WERFEL BONANZA BONANZA THE DICE GAME

PANDEMIC THE CURE

ROLL FOR THE GALAXY

LIAR'S DICE
I'M A BIG FAN OF COSMIC RUN AT ANY PLAYER COUNT BUT I DO LOVE MY CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AND SHADOW HUNTERS IF THOSE COUNT

ALSO THROWING IN STRIKE AS A GREAT QUICK FILLER
I HAVE RECENTLY BECOME A FAN OF DC COMICS DICE MASTERS BUT WOULD HAVE SAID BEFORE THEN ZOFTIG
FORGE IT'S GOT JUST THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF STRATEGY DICE LUCK AND SIMPLE RULES I LOVE IT FOR INTRODUCING PEOPLE TO BOARD GAMES OR AS THE FIRST GAME WITH A NEW GROUP
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY IS AN OBVIOUS ANSWER IF YOU LOOK AT MY FLAIR HOWEVER MY MOST RECENT ACQUISITION WAS VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO AND IT'S HAD MY GROUP VERY INTRIGUED
ROLL FOR IT HAS BEEN A LOT OF FUN AND EASY TO TEACH A GREAT PARTY GAME WHEN YOU COMBINE TWO SETS
CO-OP ELDER SIGN

COMPETITIVE TROYES
LIAR'S DICE

IMAGES I

BUY ONE OF THESE AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO WITH UP TO PLAYERS OR MORE IF YOU START EVERYONE WITH OR LESS ONCE YOU GO BEYOND PLAYERS THOUGH I VERY MUCH RECOMMEND THE SPLASH DAMAGE RULE WHERE IF THE BID IS EXACT EVERYONE EXCEPT THE CORRECT PERSON LOSES A DIE EXCEPT IF THEY HAVE LEFT OTHERWISE A PLAYER GAME WILL TAKE TURNS I TURN THE RULE OFF IF PLAYERS ARE REMAINING

THE OTHER OPTION I AM CONSIDERING IS GIVING EVERYONE DICE IN A PLAYER GAME AND DICE IF WE ARE PLAYING WITH AND 2 DICE WITH
CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AND ROLL FOR THE GALAXY ARE CERTAINLY UP THERE FOR ME I'D ALSO LIKE TO MENTION TROYES IT USES DICE IN AN INTERESTING AND SOMEWHAT UNIQUE WAY PLUS I JUST LOVE THE ARTWORK


CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AND TROYES WHEN IT COMES IN THE MAILBOX TOMORROW AAAA CAN'T WAIT CAN'T WAIT FOR GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL TO HIT A PRINT RUN I'M NOT THAT CULT OF THE NEW
I RECOMMEND QUANTUM NOT A SMALLER GAME PER SAY BUT A GREAT GAME WHICH USES DICES
FUSE TEN MINUTE COOPERATIVE GAME WHERE YOU SOLVE PUZZLES WITH DICE FROM A SHARED POOL GREAT TENSE FUN
IT'S BLUEPRINTS IT'S FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN ROLL DICE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS YOU ALWAYS HAVE CHOICE AS IT'S A DICE DRAFTING GAME AND YOU'RE PULLING FROM A POOL OF MANY

GUYS THIS IS A DIABOLICALLY SIMPLE BUT BRILLIANT LITTLE GAME SKIP A FEW PINT AND CHECK IT OUT


SEASONS I BOUGHT SEASONS SENTINELS OF THE MULTIVERSE HANSA TEUTONIA AND GLASS ROAD AROUND THE SAME TIME BECAUSE I HAD BEEN BUYING LOTS OF VERY LONG AND OR HEAVY GAMES AND I WANTED SOMETHING ELSE TO SCRATCH A SIMILAR ITCH AS CASTLES OF BURGUNDY OR ISTANBUL WITHOUT BEING EITHER OF THOSE I DIDN'T THINK WE'D LOVE SEASONS I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS DIFFERENT

SEASONS IS NOW ONE OF MY MOST PLAYED GAMES THE MORE YOU PLAY IT THE BETTER IT GETS I'VE NEVER BEEN SO SURPRISED BY THE MILEAGE I GOT OUT OF A GAME BEFORE

EDIT ALSO CASTLES OF BURGUNDY FORGOT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A DICE GAME I DON'T USUALLY THINK OF IT AS A DICE GAME EVEN THOUGH IT HAS DICE AS A CENTRAL MECHANIC AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED COB IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER WITH INSANE REPLAY VALUE

HONORARY MENTION GOES TO BANG THE DICE GAME BECAUSE IT TAKES THE CARD GAME AND DOES MOST OF THE SAME THINGS EXCEPT THE GAME ENDS BEFORE YOU STOP HAVING FUN BANG DICE IS BRILLIANT AND A GREAT BACKUP GAME TO HAVE
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY PANDEMIC THE CURE BANG THE DICE GAME COSMIC RUN KINGSBURG DICE CITY MARVEL DICE MASTERS ULTIMATE I ALSO REALLY LIKED DUNGEON ROLL THOUGH I HAVEN'T PLAYED IT RECENTLY
DUNGEON DICE
YOU WANT A BEAUTIFUL AND CHALLENGING GAME TRY DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES
FOR SOMETHING QUICK AND LIGHT I WOULD GO WITH EITHER QWIXX OR WARFUL BONANZA IF I WANT SOMETHING A LITTLE MEATIER I WOULD GO WITH DISCOVERIES HONORABLE MENTION TO QUANTUM I LOVE THAT GAME QUITE A BIT BUT I NEVER SEE IT AS A DICE GAME
TINY EPIC GALAXIES I LOVE THE TRAVEL SIZE BOX
GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL

DEAD OF WINTER

EITHER END OF THE EURO AMERITRASH SPECTRUM
KIND OF SURPRISED THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE MENTION OF ELDER SIGN SO FAR WITH ALL THE FFA MARKHAM HYPE I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING TO SEE THAT GAME GET A BUMP IN POPULARITY ON THE COATTAILS OF THE CG WITH THE ADDED CONTENT FROM THE EXPANSIONS AND A SIMPLE DICE MECHANIC IT SEEMS LIKE THE PERFECT GATEWAY AND BRIDGE GAME FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO START MOVING INTO HOVERCRAFT GAMES
ELDER SIGN
SOLO TINY EPIC GALAXIES
CO-OP ELDER SIGN
REAL-TIME FUSE
LAS VEGAS FAVOR OF THE PHARAOH AND STRIKE COME TO MIND
I LIKE BANG THE DICE GAME AND HAVE BEEN PLAYING WITH MY GAMING CLUB AFTER SCHOOL TH GRADE

I ALSO LIKE QWIXX IT'S SO EASY TO GET PEOPLE INTO IT AND SURPRISINGLY FUN FOR A SIMPLE DICE GAME
MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE IS ELDER SIGN BUT I JUST GOT PANDEMIC THE CURE FOR MY BIRTHDAY AND IT'S PRETTY GOOD ALSO AN EXPANSION JUST CAME OUT FOR IT SO I MIGHT HAVE TO GET THAT
SEAWALL THOUGH DIX MILLE IS GREAT
STAR WARS DESTINY AND IT ISN'T EVEN OUT YET
SO MY FRIENDS AND I REALLY LIKED LA GANJA NO SIESTA
RIGHT NOW IT'S MARKET IS A FANTASTIC TINY BOX GAME THAT CREATES INTERESTING SITUATIONS AND LOTS OF FUN

I'M ALSO HELPING OUT A FRIEND WITH HIS SOON TO BE PRINTED GAME CALLED TOP KITCHEN IT TAKES ALL THE REALLY FUN ELEMENTS OF FORGE AND TAKES OUT SOME OF THE MORE ANNOYING ELEMENTS OF STEALING OTHER PLAYERS WORKS

I ALSO REALLY ENJOY ROLL FOR THE GALAXY AND QUANTUM IF THOSE TWO COUNT

I WOULD LIKE TO WARN PEOPLE ABOUT NO SIESTA IT'S PRETTY MONOTONOUS AND DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO MANY INTERESTING PLAYS I MEAN YOU MIGHT LIKE IT AS AN IDEA THE FIRST TWO OR THREE TIMES BUT IT'S GOING TO QUICKLY TURN INTO THE SAME GAME OVER AND OVER AGAIN THERE IS LITTLE TO NO INTERACTION AND THE CHOICES YOU MAKE PLAY TO A STRATEGY YOU CHOOSE EARLY AND THEN PLAYS OUT ALMOST EXACTLY AS YOU PLANNED EVERY TIME IT'S JUST BLIGH
I GUESS THE CLOSEST TO A DICE GAME FOR ME WOULD BE THE VOYAGES OF MARCO POLO
COFFEE ROASTER FOR THE TIME BEING IT'S JUST A FUN KINDA THING AND I LOVE COFFEE AND HAVE EVEN ROASTED IT MYSELF BEFORE OTHERS THAT I ALSO LOVE TO PLAY SOLO

ASCENSION DREAMSCAPE SPECIFICALLY BUT ALL I HAVE PLAYED ARE GOOD
ROLL FOR THE GALAXY UNOFFICIAL VARIANT
STATE MASTER SET
PANDEMIC THE CURE
FLEET UNOFFICIAL VARIANT BASED ON ARCTIC BOUNTY
THE GAME
HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR HARD
SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL HARD BUT DOABLE
STAR TREK FRONTIERS ALWAYS FEELS DAUNTING SO I OFTEN GIVE UP BEFORE I START I NEED TO PLAY MORE

SOON I AM SURE I'LL BE ADDING CASTELLATION NAUTILICONE BLACK ORCHESTRA ATTACK ON TITAN LEGACY THE TESTAMENT OF DUKE DE CRECY THE NETWORKS AND ROBINSON CRUSOE TO THE LIST

I AM ABOUT TO PLAY NEW BEDFORD SOLO SO THAT MIGHT BE ON THE LIST IT SEEMS IT SHOULD PLAY NICELY

EDIT YEP NEW BEDFORD IS GREAT YOU CAN PLAY AGAINST AI CAPTAINS IN THE SOLO MODE TOO WHICH IS KINDA UNIQUE
THIS QUESTION GETS ASKED ALMOST EVERYDAY AND THE ANSWERS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME WE SHOULD REALLY HAVE SOME STICKY OR RIGHT SIDE BAR LINK FOR IT
MAGE KNIGHT HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE

SHERLOCK HOLMES CONSULTING DETECTIVE DON'T PLAY TO BEAT SHERLOCK JUST PLAY TO SOLVE THE CASE

HONORABLE MENTION ROBINSON CRUSOE I HAVE NOT PLAYED IT BUT HAVE HEARD GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT
MAGE KNIGHT BOARD GAME AND LOAR CG
PROBABLY GONNA GET KNIERIM AND I STILL GOT ROBINSON CRUSOE GEARS OF WAR
I ALSO ADORE MAGE KNIGHT MY OTHER FAVORITE HEAVY SOLO GAME IS FALLING SKY THOUGH ANY OF THE COIN GAMES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE JUST AS GOOD OR CLOSE ENOUGH OTHER GOOD GAMES THAT I DON'T LIKE QUITE AS MUCH PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIANCE ON DICE RESOLUTION ARE DARKEST NIGHT DAWN OF THE ZEDS AND GEARS OF WAR WHICH IS SADLY OOP

FOR QUICK GAMES I ACTUALLY PREFER BOTH OF THE OTHER GAMES IN THE UNIVERSE SERIES SYLVIAN AND CASTELLATION TO KNIERIM IF ONLY BECAUSE OF THE ABSURD AMOUNT THAT KNIERIM MAKES YOU SHUFFLE THE DECK I ALSO REALLY LIKE DEEP SPACE D AS WELL AS A COUPLE GAMES WITH LOONEY PYRAMIDS SPECIFICALLY COLOR WHEEL AND SOLOMIDS
IT'S EITHER LA GANJA OR AGRICOLA TO ME THERE IS SOMETHING MEDITATIVE ABOUT TRYING TO SOLVE THE PUZZLES THEY SET YOU UP FOR AND TRY TO SQUEEZE OUT A LITTLE MORE VP THAN THE LAST TIME ALSO THE GAMES RUN FOR A FIXED NUMBER OF ROUNDS SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'LL BE DONE
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS SUB FIND THESE DRY BORING SO YOU GOT TO KNOW WHETHER YOU LIKE THAT OR NOT
I DO ALSO ENJOY FREEDOM THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD BUT THAT ONE IS SO BRUTALLY HARD AND DARK IT'S NOT ONE I PULL OUT VERY OFTEN STILL I ENJOY MYSELF IMMENSELY WHEN I DO

I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW EDITION OF ROBINSON CRUSOE
TERRAFORMING MARS IS THE ONLY GAME I OWN THAT I PLAYED MORE THAN ONE SOLO SESSION ACTUALLY PLAYED SESSIONS CIRC

SO BY DEFINITION THIS MAKES IT MY FAVORITE SOLO GAME
STAR TREK THE DICE GAME
FRIDAY FRIDAY ITS FRIDAY
MARKHAM HORROR CG HAS MOVED TO TOP OF LIST GREAT MIX OF CAREFUL CARD PLAY AND RPG SCENARIOS WITH JUST ENOUGH DECK TWEAKING TO MAKE IT MY OWN FANTASTIC CO-OP TOO WHICH IS A BONUS ON THE RARE OCCASIONS I CAN GET SOMEONE ELSE
SCYTHE
KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER THE CONTROL OF AN ENTIRE COLONY AND MULTIPLE SURVIVORS WHILE INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNING EACH ONE IN A VICIOUS WORLD APPEALS TO ME
FOR THE NEBS NEW TO THE HOBBY NEVER TURN DOWN A GAME TRY EVERYTHING NO MATTER WHAT THE THEME GENRE YOU MAY BE SURPRISED


READ THE MANUAL AGAIN AFTER HAVING PLAYED IT REALLY HELPS FIND ERRORS IN HOW YOU PLAYED AND SOLIDIFY THE RULES IN YOUR HEAD
DON'T BUY GATEWAY GAMES IN YOUR FIRST FEW MONTHS YOU'LL REGRET OF THEM
DRINKS OFF THE TABLE
BUY GAMES THAT OTHERS WILL ENJOY OTHERWISE YOU'LL OWN A LARGE EXPENSIVE COLLECTION OF SHELF DECORATIONS
READ THE RULES BEFORE YOU HAVE TO TEACH A GAME
A MEDIOCRE GAME WHERE EVERYONE HAS FUN IS BETTER THAN A GREAT GAME WHERE HALF THE TABLE IS PISSED AT EACH OTHER TWO HOURS AFTER IT ENDS
PLAY TO HAVE FUN AND BE POSITIVE THROUGHOUT THE GAME THEN OTHERS WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE FUN AND CONTINUE TO PLAY GAMES WITH YOU AND EVEN INVITE YOU TO THEIR GAME NIGHTS FOR MORE MERRIMENT
IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE PICKING THAT LAST CARD UP OFF THE TABLE JUST SLIDE ANOTHER CARD UNDER IT NO NEED TO CHIP THE EDGES WITH FINGERNAILS SLIDE IT TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE OR TRY TO STICK SOMETHING TO IT THIS TRICK WORKS EVERY TIME
TO QUOTE KNIAZI
WHEN PLAYING A GAME THE GOAL IS TO WIN BUT IT IS THE GOAL THAT IS IMPORTANT NOT THE WINNING

SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FORGET THAT
ALWAYS CHECK UNDERNEATH THE TABLE BEFORE YOU LEAVE
RESPECT ANOTHER PERSON'S GAME TREAT CARDS MONEY ETC AS IF YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'LL BE PAYING FOR ANY REPLACEMENTS

ALSO DON'T SLAM THE DICE CUP DOWN ON THE TABLE CAUSING PIECES AND HEART ATTACKS NO ONE'S IMPRESSED BY YOUR ABILITY TO HIT A TABLE WITH A CUP
MAKE BAGS BOXES THAT CONTAIN A PLAYERS START MATERIALS WHERE SOMETHING IS VARIABLE INCREASING MONEY ON PLAYER ORDER ETC PUT THE MINIMUM IN AND DEAL WITH THE DIFFERENCE LATER
ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT GAMES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN
PLAY THEM
PLAY THE GAME BY YOURSELF BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE IT TO OTHERS NO ONE WANTS TO LISTEN TO YOU READ RULES AT THEM UNDERSTAND THE GAME SO WELL THAT YOU CAN TEACH A BIG PICTURE APPROACH TO THE GAME RATHER THAN RATTLE OFF A LITANY OF MINUTIAE
DON'T TAKE LOSING PERSONALLY TOOK ME MANY YEARS AND I WISH I HAD LEARNT IT EARLIER IN LIFE
RAMEKINS RAMEKINS RAMEKINS GO TO A DISCOUNT STORE I GO TO BIG LOTS BUY CHEAP RAMEKINS FOR PUT YOUR COMPONENTS IN THEM WHILE YOU PLAY
GO TO THE DOLLAR STORE AND PICKUP A PACK OF SMALL CONTAINERS TO KEEP SMALL BOARD GAME PIECES IN MAKES SETUP AND TAKEDOWN OF GAMES REALLY QUICK
SILICONE MUFFIN CUPS THEY'RE AWESOME FOR HOLDING RANDOM CARDBOARD BITS

IF YOU'RE DOING BOOZE AND BOARD GAMES KEEP IT LIGHT I DON'T THINK LORDS OF WATERDEEP WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE HOURS TO PLAY
CAREFULLY PLAN OUT EXACTLY WHAT GAMES YOU WANT TO BUY AND FIGURE OUT THE MAXIMUM YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND THEM REALIZE THIS IS THE MINIMUM AMOUNT ENJOY ALL YOUR NEW GAMES
BE HELPFUL FRIENDLY AND POSITIVE HARD TO GO WRONG WITH THIS
ALWAYS START A RULES EXPLANATION WITH WHAT THE GOAL IS MAKES EXPLAINING THE HOW MUCH SMOOTHER
BUY THESE LOTS OF THEM ONE FOR ANY GAME THAT HAS A LOT OF COMPONENTS UNLESS THE GAME IS VERY SMALL OR HAS AN INSERT THAT CAN'T BE DISCARDED THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC FOR STORING AND SORTING COMPONENTS THEY'RE ESPECIALLY IDEAL FOR FANTASY FLIGHT PRODUCTS BECAUSE YOU ALMOST ALWAYS WANT TO THROW OUT THE INSERT THAT CAME IN THE BOX
HAVE FUN
FIND A GROUP ON BIGGER GATHERINGS MEAN MORE CHANCES TO PLAY WHAT YOU WANT VERSUS JUST ACCEPTING WHAT YOUR CLOSE FRIENDS OR SPOUSE WANT TO PLAY
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU PLAY WITH WHOM I THOUGHT SHERIF OF NOTTINGHAM WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ANYONE BUT I HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO JUST DID NOT ENJOY IT AT ALL DUE TO THEIR HEAVY PREFERENCE FOR COOPERATIVE GAMES
PLAY BOARD GAMES WITH YOUR KIDS THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM IT MORE THAN YOU REALIZE
WHEN PLAYING WITH CHILDREN CHECK OUT BG FORUMS THEY SOMETIMES GIVE GREAT ADVICE AND SETUP FAMILY RULES TO MAKE THE GAME EASIER AND MORE FUN FOR THEM
NEVER PUT COUPLES ON THE SAME TEAM DON'T DO IT UNLESS THEY COMPRISE OF A TEAM BIGGER THAN JUST THEM



ALSO ATTEMPTING TO LEARN A GAME AFTER PEOPLE COME OVER FOR A BOARDGAME NIGHT IS LIKE GOING TO GET THE GROCERIES AFTER PEOPLE COME OVER FOR A DINNER DATE GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER AND PREPARE IN ADVANCE
GO FOR THE STRATEGY NO ONE GOES FOR AND DON'T STAND OUT
IF YOU PLAY WITH A GROUP NEVER BUY A GAME THAT SOMEONE ELSE IN THE GROUP ALREADY OWNS UNLESS YOU HAVE A DEEP NEED TO PLAY IT WITH PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE GROUP
DONT FORGET TO HAVE FUN YOU WANT TO ENJOY THE GAMES NOT SUFFER THROUGH THEM
I THINK THE BEST BOARD GAME TIP IS THE ONE ON THE LOONEY PYRAMIDS STEP ON ONE AND YOU WILL NEED STITCHES
PERSONALLY IF YOU ARE TEACHING A GAME AT THE TABLE TRY TO MAKE IT AS SUCCINCT AS POSSIBLE PLAYERS LEARN BEST WHEN THEY GET A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME SURE THERE MAY BE A NUMBER OF SPECIAL CONDITIONS OR VIABLE STRATEGIES BUT THOSE CAN BE EXPLAINED AS PLAYERS RUN INTO THEM

WHEN PLAYING A COMPETITIVE GAME I'LL LET FIRST TIME PLAYERS KNOW THAT THIS IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND NOT TO WORRY ABOUT WINNING WE CAN ALWAYS STARTUP A 2ND GAME AND GET COMPETITIVE ONCE THEY FULLY GRASP WHAT IS HAPPENING

THE WORST IS WHEN PEOPLE EXPLAIN EACH INDIVIDUAL CARD OR CHARACTER I TEND TO LOSE INTEREST EXTREMELY FAST
ONLY DOUCHEBAGS SNAP CARDS WHEN THEY LAY THEM ON THE TABLE UNLESS YOU'RE PLAYING SOME POKER OR SOMETHING WITH A CHEAP CENT DECK AND YOU'VE GOT A SWEET HAND
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU REALLY LIKE THEMATIC GAMES YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT THIS BG LIST PERHAPS SHADOWS OVER CAMELOT FURY OF DRACULA OR BLOOD RAGE WOULD BE UP YOUR ALLEY
MAY I SUGGEST DEAD OF WINTER IT IS IN MOST RESPECTS A COOP LIKE MANY OF THE GAMES YOU CITE ALTHOUGH IT HAS THE DEFECTOR WHICH MAKES IT UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU HAVE LISTED IT HAS A STRONG THEME LIKE ALL OF YOUR GAMES IT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF AN RPG FEEL TO IT IT'S ALSO JUST A REALLY FUN GAME IMO I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU CHECK IT OUT IF YOU GET THE CHANCE AND CAN PULL TOGETHER THE RIGHT GROUP
HAVE YOU TRIED COSMIC ENCOUNTER YOU MIGHT LIKE THE THEME AND THE ALIENS
DUDE THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC WITH BUT SOMEONE HAS TO BE GOOD AT MULTITASKING IT WAS A BIT DAUNTING FOR ME MANAGING BOTH CAPTAIN AND FIRST OFFICER
IS IT WORTHWHILE WITH ABSOLUTELY BUT MAKE SURE THAT IT IS A GOOD FIT FOR YOUR GROUP IT IS A RATHER UNIQUE GAME AND UNLESS EVERYONE IN YOUR GROUP FALLS IN LOVE WITH IT YOU WILL HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING IT TO THE TABLE
PROBABLY AN UNPOPULAR OPINION BUT I THINK IT'S BEST AT FIRST MATE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A FULL ROLE TO ME SO I LIKE IT COMBINED WITH CAPTAIN

OVERALL I LOVE THIS GAME
ITS FINE AT SINCE TWO OF THE ROLES CAN BE EASILY COMBINED I WOULDNT GO LOWER THAN THAT THOUGH
THE VARIANT MAKE IT GREAT WITH ANY NUMBER EVEN WITH JUST 2
I'VE PLAYED IT WITH SIX

AS CAPTAIN I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER TO MARK THE FIRST OFFICER SHEET WHEN I SHIFTED OVER THE ENGINEER I HAD TO KEEP REMINDING THE NEW CAPTAIN TO MARK THE SHEET SO I WAS NOT ALONE IN HAVING THAT PROBLEM
I CONCUR WITH WHAT MOST HERE SAID ALREADY GREAT GAME AT AND HAVEN'T TRIED LOWER YET

YOU CAN COMBINE THE CAPTAIN AND FIRST MATE QUITE EASILY BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE NATURALLY BAD AT MULTITASKING IT'S ONE OF THOSE GAMES WHEREBY YOU CAN JUST BE UNFIT FOR A CERTAIN ROLE TACTIC THAT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM SINCE THERE ARE PLENTY OF ROLES

I'VE HAD A FRIEND WHO AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF BEING THE CAPTAIN ASKED TO BE DELEAVED BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS STRESSFUL HE MADE A GREAT ENGINEER THOUGH
HAS ANYONE TRIED PLAYING THIS GAME WITH THE CAPTAIN AND ENGINEER COMBINED I FEEL LIKE THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF SYNERGY WITH THE TWO ROLES KNOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING BUT THEN AGAIN IT COULD ALSO BE VERY DAUNTING AND
YES IT'S QUITE GOOD WITH SIX ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T PLAY WITH FEWER THAN SIX
WE COMBINED ENGINEER AND FIRST MATE INSTEAD OF CAPTAIN AND FIRST MATE
LATE TO THE GAME HERE BUT I HAVE ONLY EVER BEEN ABLE TO FIELD SIX AND IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE BLAST KEEP IN MIND SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO DUEL ROLE CAPTAIN AND FIRST MATE FELT OVERWHELMED JUST BE FLEXIBLE AND FIND WHAT WORKS
I'VE PLAYED IT AT AND MOST RECENTLY ALL IN REAL TIME AS OTHERS HAVE SAID IT REALLY DEPENDS ON YOUR GROUP BUT THE GAME ITSELF IS A BLAST AT ALL PLAYER COUNTS IT FEELS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AT EACH COUNT AT I WAS CAPTAIN FIRST MATE AND ENGINEER SO THERE WAS A LOT OF ME SHOUTING AT NO ONE IN PARTICULAR HEAD NORTH OKAY OKAY HEAD EAST OKAY TORPEDOES CHARGED OKAY

MY ONE SUGGESTION IS THAT YOU GET IN A COUPLE GAMES AT IF AT ALL POSSIBLE ONCE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS HOW THE ROLES WORK ON THEIR OWN IT'S A LOT EASIER TO CONDENSE DOWN TO SMALLER PLAYER COUNTS WITHOUT A BUNCH OF WAIT SO FIRST I HAVE TO DO THIS AND THEN THIS AND WHAT DOES THIS DO
I FOUND THE GAME BETTER WITH THAN WITH WHEN WE PLAYED WITH THE FIRST OFFICER WAS ALWAYS BORED
DAMN GOOD GAME FOR JUST ACTUALLY A LITTLE EASIER
THIS IS HOW WE PLAY TALES OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS BUT THAT'S TECHNICALLY A HOUSE RULE
CONCEPT THEY EVEN PUT IN THE RULEBOOK MOST PEOPLE DON'T BOTHER PLAYING FOR POINTS JUST HAVE FUN GUESSING STUFF UNTIL YOU'RE DONE PLAYING
SPACE HULK DEATH ANGEL THERE ARE NO WINNERS BECAUSE THERE IS NO WINNING OH THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU MEANT THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS ON BG A WHILE AGO THAT WASN'T VERY HELPFUL


THE CLOSEST THAT I HAVE PLAYED IS TALES OF ARABIAN NIGHTS WHICH DEFINITELY HAS A WINNER AND SEVERAL LOSERS BUT THE FUN OF THAT GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WINNING LOSING OR EVEN TRYING TO WIN THE FUN IS IN EXPLORING THE WORLD AND CHOOSING YOUR CHARACTER'S DESTINY FOR BETTER OR WORSE

IND
FIASCO JUST PURE ROLEPLAYED
GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR
LEGO
MAYBE NOT QUITE THE ANSWER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT TELESTRATIONS DOESN'T REALLY HAVE SCORING OR WINNERS OR POINTS IT'S MOSTLY JUST HAVING A LAUGH WITH YOUR FRIENDS

I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A SCORING SYSTEM IN THE RULES BOOK BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY USE IT OVER THE YEARS
I HEAR PEOPLE OFTEN JUST SANDBOX AROUND IN FIREFLY WITHOUT FOCUSING ON THE OBJECTIVE IT DOES HAVE A WINNER AND AN END BUT IT'S RARELY THE FOCUS I GUESS
SO THERE'S GAMES LIKE MARKHAM ELRITCH HORROR WHERE EVERYONE WINS OR LOSES TOGETHER TO THAT END IT AND TABLE TOP RAGS ARE WHAT MY FRIENDS AND I PLAY A LOT WE'RE COMPETITIVE TOO BUT MOSTLY WITH VIDEO GAMES

AND IN THOSE GAMES THERE IS NO REAL LOSING TO ME EVEN WHEN THE BOARD BEATS YOU IT TELLS AN AWESOME STORY HOWEVER TRAGIC AND PLAYING NOT WINNING IS THE REAL GOAL
GALAXY TRUCKER IS INTERESTING IN THAT YOU WIN IF YOU END THE GAME WITH ANY MONEY WHO CARES HOW MUCH MONEY ANYONE ELSE MADE YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED THE GOAL OF THE GAME AND THEREFOR YOU WIN
YOU CAN PLAY GAMES LIKE CONCEPT CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY AND DIXIT WITHOUT REALLY KEEPING SCORE AND JUST USE THEM AS A MEDIUM FOR SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT

I THINK WITH MOST BIGGER GAMES PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF POINT OR GOAL TO WORK TOWARDS IF NOTHING ELSE IT AT LEAST DEFINES A STOPPING POINT YOU'RE BASICALLY TALKING ABOUT A GAME WITH NO WIN CONDITION IT COULD PROBABLY BE ARGUED THAT WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING ISN'T EVEN REALLY A GAME IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE

I DON'T MEAN ANY OF THIS DEROGATORILY I THINK IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION

THE CLOSEST THING I CAN THINK OF IS KINGDOM DEATH MONSTER IT'S A LONG CAMPAIGN STYLE GAME IT DOES HAVE AN EVENTUAL END OF SORTS MOSTLY BECAUSE IF YOU SURVIVE THAT LONG YOU EVENTUALLY KIND OF RUN OUT OF CONTENTION IT'S NOT REALLY DESIGNED TO BE PLAYED ALL THE WAY THROUGH IN A SINGLE GO THOUGH YOU COME BACK AND PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF AND CONTINUE TRYING TO SURVIVE
I THINK TECHNICALLY YOU COULD MAKE SICCITY END ONCE YOU HAD SOME CRITICAL MASS OF THE HIGHEST COST ACROLOGIES THEY'D ALL BLAST OFF INTO SPACE

BUT THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS NO THERE AREN'T REALLY ANY LIKE THAT
WE NEVER KEEP SCORE IN CONCEPT
ONCE UPON A TIME
IF YOU LIKE STORYTELLING THIS GAME IS GREAT THERE ARE WINNERS AND LOSERS BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO WINS IT'S JUST AMAZING FOR TALKING GREAT STORIES I'VE ONLY PLAYED A HANDFUL OF TIMES WITH MY GROUP BUT PEOPLE STILL REMINISCE ABOUT IT
I WOULDN'T SUGGEST PLAYING IT WITH ULTRA COMPETITIVE PEOPLE THEY CAN RUIN THE EXPERIENCE
WINTER TALES KINDA IT'S MEANT TO BE MORE STORY TELLING THAN A WINNER THERE ARE GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS BUT IT'S ALMOST EASIER TO JUST PLAY IT RPG STYLE
THE QUIET YEAR IT'S AN OPEN ENDED COLLABORATIVE MAP BUILDING GAME WHICH EACH PLAYER TAKES THE ROLE OF A KEY DECISION MAKER IN A POST APOC SOCIETY
THERE ARE ONLY LOSERS AFTER A ROUND OF CH
ROBINSON CRUSOE BECAUSE YOUR GROUP INEVITABLY DIES


CHECK OUT ARCHIPELAGO IT'S PRETTY SANDBOXES AND YOU CAN PLAY IT SO THAT EVERYONE WINS AS LONG AS THE NATIVES DON'T REBEL BUT STILL THERE IS A KINDA WINNER
MONOPOLY I MEAN SERIOUSLY HAS ANYONE EVER ACTUALLY FINISHED A GAME
EVEN MINECRAFT HAS AN ENDING BUT THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING THOUGHT
I GUESS YOU CAN MAKE A FAIR POINT THAT MONOPOLY HAS NO WINNERS
LOCKING IS BETTER I THINK THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS WARPING IF ANY OF THE PIECES WARP AND THEY ALMOST INEVITABLY WILL IT'S JUST THAT MUCH LESS ENJOYABLE TO USE UNLESS IT'S GOING TO BREAK THE BANK I WOULD SAY GO FOR A MOUNTED FOLDING BOARD THEY ALWAYS FEEL WORTH THE MONEY TO ME MAKE SOMETHING ELSE IN THE GAME CHEAPER IF YOU NEED TO BUT THE BOARD MATTERS MORE THAN ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE
LOCKING ALMOST ALWAYS ENDS UP MORE AWKWARD PROBABLY MORE EXPENSIVE FOR YOU TOO KEEP IT SIMPLE
FOLDING BOARDS ARE INFINITELY BETTER THAN EITHER OPTION BUT IT KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE GAME IF YOU'RE MOVING PIECES ACROSS THE BOARD ALL THE TIME CARDS CAN GET HUNG UP AWKWARDLY ON PUZZLE BITS IF THEY WARP HAS A GREAT PUZZLE BOARD BUT SOMETHING LIKE EMPIRE ANNOYS ME TRYING TO DRAW ON IT LOL

I'D DO A PROTOTYPE OF BOTH OPTIONS AND SEE WHICH ONE YOU LIKE
NON LOCKING IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE WAY CHEAPER BECAUSE WITH JIGSAW PIECES YOU WILL PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER DIE AND YOU RISK MAJOR RETURNS IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE DIE BEING MISALIGNED BY EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT WHICH PEOPLE CAN MANUALLY FIX WITH SQUARE BOARDS I PLAY PRETTY OFTEN SQUARE BOARDS AND HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THE BOARD MOVING AROUND TOO MUCH THE LARGER THE BOARDS ARE THE LESS OF AN ISSUE IT WILL BE NO PROBLEMS WITH THAT STAR WARS GAME OR SCYTHE BIG BOARD EITHER
THE BOARD FOR CATAN WORKS REALLY WELL WHERE THERE'S LOCKING EXTERIOR PIECES THAT HOLD IN ALL OF THE OTHER PIECES AND PREVENT THEM FROM MOVING AROUND AT ALL
THE ONLY BOARD I CAN THINK OF PLAYING IS THE BIG VERSION OF SCYTHE'S BOARD THEY INITIALLY SUPPLIED CLIPS TO HOLD THEM TOGETHER BUT APPARENTLY THOSE BROKE EASILY I'VE NEVER USED THEM THE TWO BOARDS LYING SIDE TO SIDE HAS ALWAYS WORKED FINE
MY GO TO RECOMMENDATION IF YOU LIKED CATAN IS ALWAYS CARCASSONNE HITS PRETTY MUCH ALL YOUR POINTS AND SCALES WELL IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MORE THAN 2 PLAYERS LOTS OF EXPANSIONS IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE THAT PILE OF RULES BUT EASY TO LEARN FROM THE START

BEFORE-WARNED MY FAMILY GAMING GROUP GOT STARTED WITH CATAN AND I PICKED UP CARCASSONNE FOR MY BROTHER THAT CHRISTMAS I CAN LOOK BACK ON THAT NIGHT I GOT IT FOR HIM BECAUSE I WANTED TO TRY IT AND KNOW IT WAS WHEN MY BOARDGAME ADDICTION STARTED I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND THAT NEXT CARCASSONNE
PATCHWORK VERY EASY TO GET TO THE TABLE SIMPLE IN CONCEPT BUT A LOT OF STRATEGY INVOLVED LIGHT RULES NOTHING TO DO WITH SCI-FI OR FANTASY
LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SUGGEST CASTLES OF BURGUNDY AS A GAME THAT IS NOT SCI-FI FANTASY COMPETITIVE BUT NOT CUTTHROAT QUITE DIRECTLY IN MIDDLE WEIGHT AND PLAYS GREAT WITH 2 BUT CAN ACCOMMODATE UP TO I BELIEVE
FIELDS OF ARLE I THINK MAY BE TOO COMPLEX IT IS CERTAINLY A PILE OF RULES I WOULD SAY YOU SHOULD APPROACH THAT GAME BY FIRST PLAYING AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES BIG AND SMALL FIRST THE GAMES HAVE THE SAME THEME AND ARE BOTH 2 PLAYER ONLY AND ARE BY THE SAME DESIGNER BUT AGRICOLA ACS IS MUCH SIMPLER DO NOT CONFUSE AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES BIG AND SMALL WITH REGULAR AGRICOLA WHICH IS A MORE COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE MULTIPLAYER GAME
WONDERS DUEL OR AGRICOLA ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL 2 PLAYER VERSION
THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS ALWAYS PATCHWORK
LOOK INTO THESE AND SEE IF YOU LIKE THE IDEAS HIVE MACHI BORO SIMILAR TO DICE ROLLING AND YOU CAN CHOOSE HOW COMPETITIVE YOU WANT TO BE WITH YOUR CARDS CV IS SIMPLE TO LEARN AND HAS FUN ARTWORK AGE OF WAR IS SUPER PORTABLE AND IS A HIT WITH EVERYBODY I'VE SHOWN IT TO AND IT CAN PLAY UP TO BEYOND BAKER STREET MISSION RED PLANET TRURO SPLENDOR
WELCOME THIS IS A VERY COMMON REQUEST SO WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A HANDY WIKI PAGE CALLED WHAT SHOULD I GET PSIG IT'S ALSO LINKED IN THE SIDEBAR TO THE RIGHT OF THIS POST

YOU MIGHT WANT TO START OUT WITH 2 PLAYER GAMES OR THE MORE GENERAL NEW TO DESIGNER BOARDGAMES SECTIONS THERE ARE SOME GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS IN THERE
JAIPUR IS BY FAR MY FAVOURITE TWO PLAYER GAME EASY TO PICK UP QUICK TO PLAY REASONABLE AMOUNT OF STRATEGY AND DECISION MAKING WITHOUT TOO MUCH COMPLEXITY NICE BRIGHT LOOK AND FEEL TO IT AND A NICE THEME TO BOOT

BEAR IN MIND IT IS A ONLY GAME SO WOULDN'T WORK FOR LARGER GROUPS
WONDERS DUEL I THINK WOULD BE THE BEST FIT IT'S NOT TOO COMPLEX BUT NOT OVERLY SIMPLE
WELCOME TO THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MODERN BOARD GAMING


SINCE YOU'RE RELATIVELY NEW TO THE HOBBY BELOW ARE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE THE CLASSIC OR AT LEAST MODERN CLASSIC 2 PLAYER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL ENSURE YOU BOTH HAVE A TON OF FUN WITHOUT OVERWHELMING YOU


JAIPUR A FANTASTIC CARD GAME THAT HAS YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT TRYING TO MAKE SMART TRADES TO CREATE EFFICIENT SETS OF COMMODITIES THAT CAN THEN BE SOLD FOR A PREMIUM GREAT FUN AND A MODERN CLASSIC


HIVE GAMES TEND TO VEER TOWARDS THE ABSTRACT END OF THE SPECTRUM I EAST WITHOUT MUCH OF A THEME AND THIS GAME STANDS TALL AMONG THE OTHERS IN THE GENRE A LOT OF PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS INSECT CHESS BUT DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU AWAY THIS IS A FANTASTIC STRATEGIC TILE LAYING GAME THAT IS WELL-REGARDED BY MANY GAMERS


PANDEMIC IT ISN'T TWO PLAYER ONLY PLAYS UP TO BUT IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL COOPERATIVE GAME YOU THINK COMPETING IS FUN TRY WORKING TOGETHER TO RID THE WORLD OF NASTY DISEASES


BATTLE LINE SIMPLE YET DEEPLY STRATEGIC THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES EVER MADE BY ONE OF THE GREATEST BOARD GAME DESIGNERS REINER KNIAZI YOU ARE COMPETING WITH YOUR OPPONENT TO MAKE SETS OF CARDS TO CLAIM FLAGS ON THE BATTLE LINE SO ELEGANT AND SO GOOD


HOPE THAT HELPS LET US KNOW WHAT YOU FINALLY DECIDED TO PLAY BUY AND HOW YOU ENJOYED THE GAMES HAVE FUN
