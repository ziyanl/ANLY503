I always go to the right unbiased news sources (HuffPost, WashingtonPost, CNN, etc.) because I know all other sources are wrong. But then Trump won Ohio, Florida‚Ä¶.and he won the night with the rust belt. I just don‚Äôt get it. I don‚Äôt understand how someone can have a different opinion than me. I guess racism, homophobia, facism and xenophobia won that night. If you didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary you are sexist. I weep. I weep because of how bad the economy is.

So anyway, here's a list of upcoming dates 
Tomorrow... Deadline for MI recount lawsuit
Friday... Deadline for PA electors to respond to steins lawsuit
Tuesday... Hearing in PA for stein recount lawsuit 

No idea if stein will file tomorrow. Her cost in Wisconsin alone are 4. 5 million before fees. She did say that she needs 11million now. 
Trump voters have 2 hands. Clinton voters just have tentacles.

 This would have increased his margin by a lot.

Over budget and behind schedule.   Nothing ever changes with them.
The Judge is 100% correct in saying they have no evidence of fraud, so the hand recount is not necessary. The hand recount was an delaying tactic and the Clinton lawyers joined in the Stein motion,which shows they are colluding. This was all meant to draw the electoral recount past deadline to deny Trump the electoral votes.

 About time someone stood up to this garbage. Now they will recount as the law dictates.

It's just that ain't nobody is gonna count paper fucking ballots for her - they'll just check the machines.

Anyone local wanna give an update on this?  Last I checked, she was soundly told to go fuck off...this deviates a bit.

Her entire recount was in shambles the minute it began. She illegally rose the money and missed the recount in PA. She's done. Plant Lady BTFO 
She just spat in the face of the most powerful crime ring in the World. Watch the obituaries. She's a hero.
Not surprising. The state has strict voter ID laws. Trump won by almost 30k votes. Too little opportunity and too big of a margin. No self-respecting judge would look at this.

I can understand Michigan and Wisconsin. They look identical but I am having a hard time finding out how identical since: "The state of Wisconsin does not have statewide Election Night reporting."

So I have to go through each county. Makes it hard for the common folk to examine it for themselves.

Edit: I think Jill is doing it for the Libertarian party to get funding for a third party next election cycle. Not a bad thing tbh. We've been bitching about not having a third party and to be quite frank both parties are in a tug of war that's getting old.  

Trust but verify. 
From what I understand, the recount is still happening. It is just being done by machine.

Is that better or worse?

Excuse me brethren, is anyone tired of winning yet?
This is incredible. When has a politician ever kept a campaign promise they made over a year ago, and gotten results before they were even sworn in to the presidency?

The answer is never.

Trump is not a politician. He meant everything he said, and he started working on his promises as soon as he won.

#MAGA
Show those Carrier guys some likes and retweets for coming to their senses. :)
Trump is not even president yet and he has fought harder in the past 2 weeks for American jobs than Obama has in 8 years. I can only imagine where we will be 8 years from now! God it feels good to have a real leader.

As someone who works in the commercial hvac industry, design engineer for a direct competitor for carrier...i will attempt to explain to you guys how big dick of a move this was. 

Carrier was already one of the most competitive, biggest producers in the game. There are brands that make cheaper products such as goodman or lennox, but hvac is a complex and large industry with a lot of technology (imagine a skyscraper in a humid envirnoment like houston...it requires a lot to keep 70 floors of building cool and dry). Lets say "munters" (real world example) was a 10/10 with technology but a 3/10 with market share ability. Carrier was a 5.5/10 technology with a 9/10 market share ability (most commercial buildings wont require a high level of hvac technology). So carrier had everything to gain by going to mexico and saving allll of that money on production. The product i design is an 7/10 technology and 6/10 market share so we battled with carrier frequently. Carrier stood to make a lot of money moving to mexico, while our factories are still in america. OUR GOD EMPEROR MADE AN AMAZING, GENIUS SALESMAN, UNIMAGINABLE MOVE TO KEEP THEM IN AMERICA. 

Keeping the market competitive while saving american jobs....people....we made the right choice.

*Provoked by its nearby predator, the Carrier remains still and bends a knee ever so swiftly to signal surrender to the Donald in waiting, hoping to prevent ambush and live to see another day. The Donald recognizes the bending of the knee and loses interest in its prey after earning the satisfaction of seeing the wild Carrier recognize his Alpha presence. The Donald wanders off to stalk a different beta prey, and it is here where the wild Carrier will remain perfectly still, knee bent, for the next 8 years, so as to remain alive and protect her younglings.*

This is Trump's America. A place where jobs are saved, our public safety workers are valued, and our borders are secure. What a time to be alive. The next 8 years are going to be GREAT ! 
The best part? I bet so many cucks were pulling for Carrier to leave to make Trump look bad. 

YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE WHEN YOU'RE NOT PULLING FOR AMERICA! SAD!
You guys see the comments on that twitter post? People are wanting to boycott Carrier for working with him. That is.... unbelievable 
Trump could cure cancer and r/politics would still bitch, the American people know better. And will remember this in 2020 for reelection, No brakes!
#FYI FOR SHILLS 

#1,000 employees is a large business.  For simple discussions sake, let's say they're all paid 20K a year (which is absurdly low, they make more) that's 20 million dollars a year in jobs Trump and Carrier just saved.  Keep the tears flowing.
Keep it up!
Could you even imagine Obama doing anything like this? NOPE! Trump does what Obama don't! Obama worst president confirmed.
BIG LEAGUE STUFF
Went to /r/politics to see the negative spin. It's there and it's ridiculous. I Replied to some lib and ended up getting banned for saying shut up.
Holy shit lads 
How many jobs were at that plant?!
Anyone surprised by this outcome has not been paying attention.
#TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS
This is all thanks to Obama's recovery! /s

(That's the new leftard Party Line now, apparently.)
*UNDER*
I'd like to hear how this gets twisted into Trump did nothing like the last one. 
On the surface, this is very impressive.  Almost Reagan getting-the-hostages-freed-impressive.  I wonder what the details are.
hahaha, he fucking did it. top kek
Holy fucking shit
I'm so happy for those workers, don't understand how people can not like trump 
Amazing difference between CNN and Fox about this.  CNN immediately goes negative while Fox reports the actual news.  Screw the cucks at CNN.  This is an uplifting story and great news for those affected!
% this lands on r/politics?  ZERO!
**this is a fucking movement folks**
I saw word of this a few hours ago! (Rumor, but hoped it was true.)

#Not Even In Office

#Making America Great Again!

This train don't stop for **NO ONE!**

Oh, Soros shills, please pass word to boss: EXTRADITION TO SOROS' NEW HOME IN SIBERIA is *just around the corner!* Hope he likes his new digs!

Word to the wise: he might wanna take A COAT! I think we got one that says:

**MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!**
**Will CNN report on this? (they won't)**
PRESIDENT OF ALL AMERICANS
My president is a bad ass. 
Makes me mad we had a cuck president the last 8 years. What the fuck has he done to better the lives of the common American people? Nothing. He'd rather let in hoards of refugees from half way around the world to a culture that is completely against everything they were taught since they were born. Disgusting
I can't take this much winning. Please Mr. President, not so much winning.
#*The Art of the Fuckin Deal*
Get fucked I'm already tired of winning! Ahead of schedule and under budget
[ _ ] Not Winning

[ X ] Winning
Can't wait to see this post on /r/po-oh wait...nevermind.
/un-jerk

Announcements like this are great news and we want more like it. I'm not down with the "KNEES = BENT" tag. If and when Trump is able to accomplish the great things he's talked about, we should respond positively and welcome the change. When companies make moves to give hardworking Americans jobs, we shouldn't mock them for being subservient pussies. It's a good deal for the country, it deserves a positive response from us, and we can only hope more corporations will follow suit.

/re-jerk
You know HRC wouldn't have given a shit about these jobs leaving.
Can't wait for the CNN/NYT article as to why this is NOT because of Trump.

Sad.
MOTHER FUCKING YES ... YES YES YES YES YES... 


#carrier is trending on twitter & of course u still have idiots finding a negative with this.  
THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THIS THOUGH. I was told that I would be tired of winning and its not happening.....
Duh Winning!!!
I know Trump likes to operate under budget and ahead of schedule, but this is just ridiculous. I wasn't expecting to win so much so soon. Fuck, I can't take this, where are the brakes?
Embrace the Trump fellow Hoosiers for this is what winning feels like!
The God Emperor has accomplished more in two weeks than Obama has in eight years.. We're gonna keep on winning folks! 
When Donald Trump isn't even President yet and he's working on behalf of the American people keeping jobs in our country. Just wait till he gets into office! MAGA
MAGA IN THE MAKING. STAY TUNE FOR GREATNESS
I can't wait for the next thing the media tells us Trump won't (He will) be able to do. 
**Brings a tear to my eye to see for the first time in my life a President that is willing to work for the American people in such a simple, common-sense way.**
Ford announced that they are not leaving and Apple may build products back in the US. Trump will create the promised 25 million Jobs in 10 years. Remember lefties, 3 words: JOBS, JOBS , JOBS!
That's 1,000 families that have renewed hope for the holidays.  So damned good.
TREMENDOUS
LMAO the libtards are salty https://sli.mg/qr7UES
So, SO proud that he's going to be our President. Not even offically in office yet and already MAGAing like a beast and working on fufilling his campaign promises.
So much wall. Many high. Very MAGA!
"They were never going to leave " - Washington Post probably 
How come I missed this?  I listened to NPR for over an hour tonight, not one word.
Not a fan of the title flair "KNEES=BENT".  This is called business, Carrier probably made initial financial sacrifices to stay here and work with President-Elect Trump.  

The only knees bending is the American liberal idiots.  
This is just a bandage, my nigs. We need a tariff 
UNDER BUDGET, AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.
#CAN'T STUMP

He is a ground-game President!
I can't take this much winning! 
Under budget and ahead of schedule!  
#THE MADMAN DID IT! WEW!
That's fantastic! Great day for those hard working Hoosiers!
Already getting more done than Obama 
If you think Trump won't be making America great again, you probably watch fake news. 
Question: How has Trump been able to keep all of these companies inside the US?
I'm so happy for those people!! Someone's cutting onions in here again
Fuck yeah. MaGa. 
Already done more than Barack Hussein O.
ZOMG

The left hates people that empower others to excel and reach their potential sooooo much....

The popping tonight... it won't be fireworks folks, it's gonna be liberal aneurysms. 
1000 ?? what about the other 1000
FUCK MR PRESIDENT PLEASE CAN WE STOP WINNING ITS TOO MUCH
#not even legally allowed to call himself POTUS and already saving jobs bobama couldn't! under budget and ahead of schedule!
say it with me. Under budget and...
#I AM NOT YET TIRED OF WINNING
This is just incredible. He actually kept his promise. MAGA 
Heroic
you have to see what the libs over at our favorite political "discussion" thread are saying, it's fantastic. Make sure you got popcorn
WINNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
More great news for the American worker. Trump is going to make America THE PLACE to do business once again. I can already feel the GDP increasing and wages rising! Yeah Don! 
Under budget and ahead of schedule...
Is he gonna be able to bring more of their jobs back here? 
Defying previous assumptions on how far the human knee can bend. 
30k a year times 1000 times .12 = 3.6 million 

3.6 million a year into social security by Trump making some phone calls.... 
this is how we are going to save our Seniors and America by working ourselves out of the Globalists control...
Sounds like Trump reminded them that government contracts can be ripped up.
It's great to have at least 1,000 more Americans keep their jobs!
[Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/X3Ud1Bl.png)

I hope you like it
Thanks Obama! Not!
I wonder how r/redacted will spin this...
Liberals BTFO
B-But Trump is going to kill the middle class!!


When does the IT visa block start?

 - every well trained and knowledgeable tech person
**AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND UNDER BUDGET**
#**HIS NAME WAS 1400 JOBS THOUGH** 


**Fine ill take 1000**
Good. Though I wonder why 1k and not all 2k. Are the rest going to Mexico? I'd like to find out.
Trump's done more for blue-collar America in a month than Obama has in 8 years.
These next four years will be amazing.

spez: kek forgive me, I mean eight.
I thought it was impossible to keep factories jobs in America. Thats what all the libtards have been telling me for the last 6 months at least.
Presidenting before he is even President.
Trump will make Obama look so lame by January 21 Vets are going to be discussing the ethical issues of not euthanising him.
,.............. i think im getting tired of winning.
Suck it liberals. Grab em by the pussy 
**THE ART OF THE DEAL**
Sitting on the pot. You lose. MAGA  shitpost all you want my fellow centepees. GO American people! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!work calls.  Bed    

Trump hasn't even taken the oath of office and he's keeping jobs from going overseas. 

**Make America Great Again!**
You'd think Pence was new to Indiana or something.
I'm waiting so bad to see/hear how the MSM will spin this as a negative.
And he's not even sworn in yet. Holy shit future is bright. We have the best President don't we folks. 
Well,if Obama wasn't handing out medals like Halloween candy, he could have done the same thing.... And the Presidential Medal of Freedom for best golf course in Indy goes to...
Under Budget Ahead of Schedule. 
That's wonderful
AND HES NOT EVEN SWORN IN YET!!! 

I'm tired of all this winning (I'm not)
# **I'M STILL NOT TIRED OF WINNING!**
Fucking mad man is already creating jobs before he reaches office. 
Are they going to be punished for still shipping about 1000 jobs out of America though?

ALL OR NOTHING!  WE ARE MAKING ALL OF AMERICA GREAT, NOT *SOME* OF AMERICA GREAT!
If only I can get a job with Carrier instead of this bullshit Air Conditioning company I'm with they got benefits and there's Union in NYC 
Redacted is soooooooo triggered right now. They don't know what to say 
...alright I guess this was a good thing he has done. IM STILL SKEPTICAL THOUGH 
I'm already tired of winning and he hasn't even taken office yet
Trump has spoken:

>I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a major announcement concerning Carrier A.C. staying in Indianapolis. Great deal for workers!

Hell fuckin yeah!!!! The man delivers!!!!!!
I was waiting to see this on CNN. (I wasn't, that network sucks). 
God Emperor is Making America Great Again fifty days before he swears in. 
How can you not upvote 1000 Americans keeping their jobs?!
This is just the beginning. We have not even begun to WIN.
Ahead of schedule!
Nope, won't ever get tired of winning
Corporations are incentivized to claim these things regardless of whether or not Trump/Pence made a difference because it makes them look good. 
"My next A/C will be a Trane. True American companies don‚Äôt negotiate with misogynistic xenophobic trolls / terrorists."

Democrats can only win over the illegal and the insane.
[The video is heartbreaking when they announced to their workers what their decision was.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3ttxGMQOrY)

Carrier was put in a tough spot.  Companies are being forced to move or suffer the consequences of being "Made in the USA".  Survival or ride the sinking ship.  Trump is breath of fresh air.  His removal of 2 current regulations for every new 1 is brilliant.  
THATS HOW ITS DONE!
wtf i hate trump now. i can no longer use globalism as an excuse for being a neet.
They were going to save $65m/yr moving jobs. Tax breaks or quid pro quo is certainly higher to keep them. The govt could have hired these people to stare at the wall for less...

Edit: Seriously, what math am I missing?
Ehhhh.  "Close to 1,000" is emphatically not 1,700 - and I'll trust the PR-speak from them and the dickhead faggot-gatherer wannabe Duke of Earl that runs their Local and won't feel consequences once I actually *see* some of these details...

What's getting shifted around on the state level; will this be a larger tax burden for homeowners?

Why aren't they re-hiring them *all*...sounds instinctively like it was an outfit that had already been cut down insofar as the labor costs...pay going to be the same, worse, etc?

Hell with what OP says - I want to *see the entire deal* before I go clapping away like a seal and thanking them; if they could've done this before instead of selling us out...they should have.

There's a lot that stinks of cat piss from stem to stern here.

*Edit:  I don't care, per se - but how's about some arguments where I take your $20 and give you back $16 is an okay deal for you - that's what I was focused on here, and seriously...most of that was rhetorical, theoretical, etc.*

*I'll wait to see the results.  I understand compromise is necessary.  That's still a lot of people out of work who may or may not be able to become fuckin' CNC programmers or are too old to take up landscaping or whatever.*

*Jerkfaces. <3*

*Stop bashing the arrow and talk about with this with me - I'm trying to* **learn** - *not have shitty economic debates!*
So proud of my president, and my country
It's a great start, now drive the knife in deeper and give it a twist, see if they can be forced to move those Mexican jobs BACK. 
TRUMP TRAIN AHEAD OF SCHEDULE!!

HE DID IT!
#MADMAN
Praise kek!
I've started seeing some people claim that Trump and these companies entered into a conspiracy to say they're outsourcing jobs to make Obama look bad, only to "let" Trump convince them to stay in the States. 
Now we can see how shit of a President Obama was.  Incompetent ass.
Holy PHUARK 
SO FUCKING TIRED OF WINNING.
I want to know how did the deal come about. Was there some tax abatement or some other kind of relief?
This sounds like a negotiation. do we know how many jobs total are staying/going?
he's making deals before he's president
Our president does not lose and we will ride with him till the end! Praise KEK.
Journalists hardest hit
Dont you racists know that jobs are a source of WHITE SUPREMACY
Fucking love this man
Art of the fucking deal.   Our politicians are useless.    We need to start electing more non-politicians.  
#AHHHHHH! I CANT HANDLE ALL THIS WINNING!

#DAHN MAKE IT STOP!
He probably walked into that meeting and threatened them with tariffs out the ass and when they found out he wasn't kidding they met his demands pretty quick. This is what happens when you have an alpha male businessman making the deals instead of a wet noodle like Obama.

Cucks and shills wasting millions to hand count votes knowing they will still lose, meanwhile Trump saved 1k jobs that will help 1k American families.
This is amazing.  


NOT EVEN FUCKING IN OFFICE YET!

UNDER BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE!

MA FUCKING GA!
I'm really excited for the next 8 years!! Gonna be helluva ride!!
Trump is already doing so much and it's barely been a month!
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
maybe ill go apply, indy native here.
Centipedes!  Focus on the goal.  We need to give credit where credit is due.  Retweet @carrier and promote them for coming to their senses.  We reward those that MAGA!


Not even in office yet! 

##Multi-dimensional time traveling deal maker
and here I was told that the Mexicans had all been fired and replaced by robots by now.


"Yeah but Trump can't actually do what he just did" - the libs
#TOO MUCH WINNING
This is absurd to the point of being comical. Does this point to Obama incompetency? They're literally pretending he doesn't exist.
Can't stop winning!
Trump created more jobs before he became president than Obammy did in 8 years?  That terrible, terrible man!
The comments on twitter are cancerous.

Mr Trump, please sir, you can't accomplish tasks before we even start a scheduled.
I wonder what was negotiated. Maybe promise of way lower corporate taxes than Mexico ? 
Looking forward to seeing how /r/redacted spins this amazing news into something bad
so... Trump is Tassadar on the Gantrithor now?
Well, Conservative radio will be on fire tomorrow.   With POTUS brand publicity, maybe something similar to Chick-fil-a might happen with Carrier.
Don't get rude. Wait for more details before jumping to a lay off assumption is all I'm saying. Until then, 
Will someone post back on twitter to the guy saying he will only buy TRANE from now on for Carrier negotiating with Trump?

TRANE is now headquartered in Ireland via Ingersoll Rand taking advantage of tax shelters Trump seeks to squelch. Carrier is a US based and US headquartered company.

Spez: I don't have the bird words
Holy shit. Obama came into my room to bring me a plate of tendies and I literally screamed at him and hit the plate of tendies out of his hand. He started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on him. I‚Äôm so distressed right now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I didn‚Äôt mean to do that to Obama but I‚Äôm literally in shock from the winning. I feel like I‚Äôm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he always winning? This can‚Äôt be happening. I‚Äôm having a fucking orgasm. I don‚Äôt want to believe the world is so spicy. I cannot fucking deal with this much winning right now. CNN said it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be like this. This is so fucked.
Can't. Tell. What. Is. Trolling,
LET THE TENDIES HIT THE FLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How much of my taxes will they be getting?
What kind of deals are these? What are his bargaining tools to keep jobs here? Threat of tariffs?
He is giving massive tax breaks to corporations and will sell it to Congress and the citizens as "We are going to keep jobs here. You better agree to lower taxes." That's why Carrier is keeping jobs in the state. 
What did he promise them in exchange?
This is great news, except for one thing.  There were 2,000 jobs on the line, and if Carrier is keeping "close to 1,000" then that means more than half of the Carrier employees still lost their jobs.  Is Carrier still moving to Mexico?  How can this be considered a victory?  I'm the biggest Trump fan I know, but hell, even I can do math, and even I know that if more than half of those 2,000 employees are still losing their jobs, then this isn't a victory.  Details.  I want details.  And what about the 35% tax on the products coming back over the border?

[deleted]
What do you think the "deal" is? I would assume Carrier gets something out of it? Maybe just good publicity for their company?
To all employees: Congrats! Thanks to Trump and Pence you can now all keep your jobs as we can now turn a higher profit by staying in the US of A! This of course means a higher tax rate for all IN citizens, including yourselves, as well as state taxes going to cover to fallout of deregulation. But you can rest easy knowing that we are resting easy with our bonuses and and increased profit margins. All thanks to the hard, underpaid, contributions that you all have made to our wallets.. I mean company!

I mean, you people will probably ignore actual facts, but here http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-utc-idUSKBN13P038?il=0.

Do some ACTUAL reading that isn't this man's twitter feed. 
How is this good news? Still a cut in jobs?

Don't put whales plastic bags! What the shit?!
pls clap.
Quality Shitpost my Dude.
Orcas are beautiful intelligent creatures.  They are highly social and family-oriented.  What on Earth do they have to do with Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer?  
You got my fucking hopes up
i hate you, and by extension this subreddit, for making me believe amy schumer was really leaving the country for a second when i saw just the title. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. i don't care what kind of crazy political beliefs she has. she is painfully unfunny and i just can't take one more second of her.
Dammit!!!

Stop getting my hopes up for nothing.
Come on man. Whales are at least likeable.[This](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/29/24508D9B00000578-0-image-a-36_1419860789409.jpg) is a far better comparison.
I'm so offended by this sticky. Killer whales are pretty cool and shouldn't be compared to such filth as Schumer or Dunham.
This is offensive. It's really upsetting that you'd compare those two poor, innocent whales to those fat hacks Schumer and Dunham.
Oh shit they've been working out
Do they literally put whales in giant plastic bags with a rubber band, or is this photoshopped?
In Canada, whales come in bags.
Im liberal af and man do i hate those girls. 10/10. 
I literally choked on my morning coffee just now when I saw this. Half my kitchen is sprayed and tears are rolling out of my eyes. 

Good job. 
As a non-Trump supporter, I love this goddamn sub. Only for the memes though.
\#1 on r/all 

Bow down to the God Emperor r/The_Donald
I don't even support Trump or browse this sub, but I'd be damned if I didn't admit some of these memes are dank. 
My girlfriend said "it's so sad that they put the whales in bags just to ship them" Jesus Christ I'm dating a special person
You are insulting whales.
Bro, those whales actually deserve freedom.  Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham, not so much.
Good riddance.
The fucked up thing is I used to like Amy Schumer when she was on Delocated.
that cant be amy schumer, it has gone more than 10 seconds without saying something about their vagina.

and that isnt lena dunham, they would never agree to be in a container where they couldnt rape a sibling.

...you know, it's kinda amazing how lena dunham is a liberal icon.  I thought they hated sexual abuse?  Yet they rally behind a rapist?
Came here hoping I wasn't the only moron who thought those whales were actually in plastic bags at first. Leaving happily disappointed. Happy because the rest of you aren't morons. Disappointed because today I've learned I'm a moron.
Funny...I figured Schumer to be a sperm whale.
Love that this in at the top of r/all !
Lmfao. I don't think I've laughed my ass off this many days in a row just from browsing r/all
This will never stop being hilarious 
Do you guys hear that? That's the sound of the whole /r/all being triggered simultaneously. 
Makes me sad to see them bagged up like goldfish.  I guess i should feel bad for the goldfish too, but not so much.
Lmao this sub always cracks me up.
I knew the new sticky was going to be spicy af

o lordy
Hope the door hits em on their way out.

Spez: They'll likely be more comfortable living in North Korea anyway.
YOU LEAVE THISE BEAUTIFUL WHALES ALONE, seriously though they're my favorite animals
MAGA MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Quit getting my hopes up!
Hahahaha
She'll be eat'n blubber alright as soon as I free willie
Send them to the moon to be with Willzyx.
I'm as liberal as they come and this literally had me on the floor laughing 
# kek^kek^kek^**kek<--This¬†one**
What a let down!
LOL
People are actually sad when bad things happen to whales, these two would be celebrated. 
Never gets old
These posts keep getting my hopes up..
As a liberal; LETS PLEASE GET THESE 2 OUT
For a second I thought this was real
No brakes!
Jokes aside, that's really sad for the animals.
This is an insult to orcas everywhere 
The average IQ in America just went up!
Meanwhile the engineering team is still working out how to transport Rosie
I mean really, this sub just keeps making \all great again, day in and dayout
Best part: this is on r/all 
Here's one of the jokes everyone can get around. For once, way to go. 
[Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/okPD7gU.png)

I hope you like it
Sticky speed unparalleled!
If Trump deports them both there will be a 49 State Landslide. Believe me folks. 


#HOLY FUCKING SPICYYYYYYY
That really Wew'd my Lads
#PRAISE KEK
Terrible. People actually like whales. 
On a serious note why are they still here? I want them to leave this country. What can we do? I have deep hatred for many celebs due to the election. They think just because they are famous they are going to influence us how to vote. Fuck them all
Kinda unrealistic. Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer are Beluga whales.
If this were true, it would be the first time a liberal was consistant
I don't get it.   They are killer whales? 
I was already getting excited that they were leaving but this is great too! lol
#The level of savagery... 

#IS TOO DAMN HIGH (energy)
Did you just assume their species?
Real talk have they shown their faces in public the 8th? Do people heckle them in their shows about it?
Yes! 
Get their fat asses out of here. :-)
Fuckin' savage!
Off topic, that makes me feel so bad for the orcas :( ... I'm aware it's a fake, it's just the imagery.
WOW! I hated seaworld before, but now I really fucking hate them. LOOK AT THAT SHIT, IT MUST BE TORTURE FOR THOSE WHALES.

P.S. Stop comparing those poor whales to fatty mcfat Amy Schumer And Lena Dunham its cruel, those whales DID NOTHING WRONG!!!
Can this please be the top post on Reddit.  This is fucking gold.
As somebody that identifies as Trans-orca/attack helicopter I find this deeply problematic.


Any updates on Rosie?
Can't we start ignoring them. Maybe they'll go away on their own.
Toppest of keks
I didn't vote for Trump, but this is a shitpost I can get behind.
HIGH ENERGY shitpost!!! MAGA.
They will have a whale of a good time. 
I got really excited for a second 
That's an insult to orcas. 
#DAMN LENA LOST SOME WEIGHT!!
LOL their natural form without all the cosmetics and clothes on.
Fat, ugly, talentless.

How did these women get famous again?
That is really offensive and rude and hurtful... cannot believe you could insult an orca whale like that. Smh
Seriously though Amy Schumer saying she wants to go to Canada is a Mad-Cow Disease joke waiting to happen. 
Lena has lost weight.  Good for her!
Sadly, almost all celebs who said they would move have retracted their statements. Goes to show they really know how good America is.
Alright, spending most of my time smh at all this shit around the election but this is fucking great.
Is that a little pile of Al Sharpton in the bottom of the bag going along for another free ride?  I hope so.
This made me laugh so fucking hard holy shit.
Alright...don't usually go to this sub but this made me laugh
Lena is unscrewable. She really does remind me of a woman with bad post-sex/menstruation hygiene. Like, that time I was getting out of the pool and the skanky woman was getting in and I caught a whiff of her ladybits. It was like pennies, chlorine and hot cabbage. Lena looks lazy, like she wouldnt bother to clean up her home until her kids were old enough for the chores then she would insist they clean every day. Otherwise shes going to sit there, with taco sauce on her t-shirt, empty food wrappers on the coffee table, cigarettes put out in a paper plate of food, and junk mail spilling onto the floor. She makes me think of the smell of hot dog water if she stood too close while talking to me.  I think I hate her.
 Amy makes me think of that woman that walks the male dog with the big genitals that is always nuzzling its snout at her crotch out of a habit Amy wants to keep secret, and her arms will end up like Oprah Winfreys eventually. Im pretty sure I hate her too.
You guys are the best rofl
Pretty sure those whales have a higher intelligence than such aforementioned plebs
There was  gravel from the tank in the bottom of those  bags but Lena Dunham shoved it all in her sister's pussy

Picture is wildly inaccurate.

Replace orkas with manatees. 
Make sure you let the bags sit in your aquariums water for up to an hour or your dunhams and schumers may die.
That's extremely disrespectful to land whales

Lets not insult those beautiful creatures like that.  
Better make sure they follow the rules... [http://lenadunham.ca/](http://lenadunham.ca/)

Dammit, I get excited every time I read a title like this.
you'd  be in jail
Funny, but you're still an ass for getting my hopes up.
No, no, no. Orca whales are beautiful creatures.  Schumer and Dunham are grotesque lard asses.  You don't look at them in awe, you look at them if you want to turn gay. 
Dang it you got my hopes up
A past girlfriend of mine loved sea world and knew way too many facts about the whales. She told me that the whale with the floppy fin is autistic. It's an insult to autistic whales everywhere to be compared to Amy Shumer 
Ms Dunham & Ms Schumer arriving at Little St. James earlier today.



Every morning I cannot believe that the PC culture is over!!! OVER!!!!
thats insulting to the whales
As if there's s country that would want them.
Killer joke.
God damnit, I saw the title and got all excited.
Send'em to the moon, will be funny AF

Hey we get those bags back right?
Oh boy I hope they see this

You got me all excited for no reason. 
You shouldn't compare those majestic creature to Lena and Amy
Aww I got excited for a second
They put whales in giant fucking ziplock like goldfish?! That's fucking amazing. 
clearly photoshopped.  They are approximately the same size. lol

Hey love the post either way.. but I'm stoned and now I need to know do they really put killer whales in those big ass bags like gold fish???? That is so awesome!
Help a drunk guy out. Is this photo real or not? If real wtf, I know you bag fish but whales?
They're just ORCS not Orcas,  OP. 
Hoooly shit. This is the greatest shitpost I've ever seen. 
HAHAH
#OUT! OUT! OUT!
I'm not the biggest fan of these two, but this is a shit joke
Don't give me false hope : (
Off topic, but this is legit sad.  I hate how sea animals are exploited :(
This is fantastic news. We will welcome them with open arms here in Canada. We are always happy to have strong independent womyn, that are intelligent and funny. Non-stop vagina jokes are the best. We will build a special stadium, just so Amy Schumer has somewhere large enough for her to perform. Praise Allah.
It's so disappointing to see this hackneyed shit at the top of /r/all

It barely has any relevance to Trump at all
That seriously how they transport whales?
i wish there was a citizenship exchange program :(
Wow, cmon OP..

That's clearly Rossie O'Donnel
wew
PRAISE KEK!
i they ever really leave they will call themselves "trump refugees"
lmao. Finally.  

it seems like these two relish (and xtra mayo) being fat and thus despised by people who they claim are enemies. If we were able to break thru their golden brown fried crusty defense mechanisms, to reluctantly penetrate to the soft, sizable underbellies, maybe the effects would influence them to permanently leave public life, but for real...really really for real
And what of Rosie Odonnell?
KEK
Fly me to the moon Wilziak
I got excited but I guess I should've expected the shitpost.

Hey now, Orcas are majestic creatures that can bring smiles to people across the globe.
Beautiful choice of image. 

The thumbnail is just vague enough that it didn't spoil it
why are we insulting those poor orcas? :( 

Damn this got my hopes up
That's a spicy meme-a-ball!
looks like they're losing some weight though. 
I didn't know that Amy Schumer had a twin...
I thought that one was Ana Navarro til I got a closer look! :-)
###JUST
Hey now, orcas are beautiful, majestic creatures that are also highly intelligent. What did they do to deserve this comparison? 
Is Amy Schumer Married to Chuck Schumer??
Wait those must be look alikes... they are pretty funny! 
this photo makes me uncomfortable
So is it time to comment "shammmooveeee the fuck out" on all of their instagram pictures?
There is going to be a Finding Nemo class event. 
#Thank God finally. Knew that the air route is not a financially feasible way to transport them out of the country.
r/SuckitUpPussy
Considering reddit management is full of fatties, and they've banner subs for "fatshaming" before. I'm betting they'll use these kind of posts as excuse to ban the don
that's a mean trick to play, you had my hopes up :(.
OH MY you will hurt somebodies feelings! We all know society collapses when people are offended! 
That title is complete bullshit!

I don't see any suitcases.
I couldn't tell they were whales until I read the comments. They looked like giant leeches..
I wanted this to be true then I saw the picture & sub
so which one's the rapist and which one of them is about as funny as rape? I keep getting them mixed up
I got excited before the pic loaded and was disappointed. 
god i love this place
Dude, seriously? Orcas are offended.
Just about pissed myself
ORCA LIVES MATTER
Holy Neptune, give those rubber bands strength. 
those are big plastic bags filled with water.

There is a hindi term KLPD 
(khade lund pe dhoka) which translated means 'erection betrayed' and is used in the context things which initially result in a surge of hope only to quickly be a major let down upon close examination.

Posts like this should be tagged KLPD.  Think of this as a the beginning of a global right wing cultural exchange.  /r/indianews uses 'cuck' and 'fake news' now.  /r/the_donald should return the favour.

that's gotta be a big toilet.
That's insulting to killer whales. Should be masses of red tide.

Still feel.bad for the orcas in minnow bags. Did you know that these are from the Northeast Pacific?
Pocket whale 
wait is that actually how they put the whales out of water?
I don't understand how this is the top post when it has lower upvotes than other posts.  
We're better than this, fam. 


We need to start banning these posts because they always result in disappointment.
In all seriousness I didn't know that is how they transported whales, lol...
Serious question: Is that really the safest way to transport Orca whales?
they make plastic bags that big? 
Is this a shoop? do they do this to whales?
Good news, but I can think of more than should leave in a huge way.
That must be one hell of a carnival game they won
They are actually much more akin to a walrus with extra blubber
On a serious note, what is happening to those poor whales?
Are you sure that's what's going on here? I can't see either of their faces.
The quicker, the better.
Fuck you Sea World

Got bad news guys lena and amy wont be leaving the US, planes have carrying capacaties too
Literally saw this and said "Thank fucking jesus" before clicking on the picture
You actually got my hopes up :/
These are truly majestic creatures. Hopefully another nation will have the resources to provide with them the love and care they so sorely need. 
lena looka dead
Not only Rosie O'Donnell anymore 
Is anyone else slightly disappointed that UP is joking? 
You got my hopes up...

I also was wondering which country would actually take them.
I'm not sure why baby photos of them are the most current ones being used here
Well neither one of them are funny, so no loss there.
Heh, I saw this photograph on a link that "The Onion" posted on Facebook this morning. I thought it was rather funny IMO
Those look depressed as hell :(
Those looked like turtles until some said killer whale 
I wonder if they're actually child rapist/abusers (think pizzagate) fleeing impending justice?
You got my hopes up.
Back to the moon with you üê≥ 
Are those turtles in bags? 
On a side note it must suck to be those orcas...

That shit just looks so unnatural

I remember last year around this time is when I first heard about Trump. I didn't spend much time online. I just bartended and went out with my friends after. I had paid almost no attention to politics since 2008.

I was behind the bar and the other bartender was like "hur dur did you hear about how Trump wants to build a wall?"

I was like "LOL omg really a wall?" go to www.donaldjtrump.com to read about his crazy policies. Buy a MAGA hat after about 5 minutes. 
I read that in their voices.

#HOLY SHIT! WHERE HAS TUCKER CARLSON BEEN MY WHOLE LIFE!

Goddamn, this guy is based as fuck.
I can't believe people as stupid as this Tariq guy exist.
Did he just call Tucker a suspected White Supremacist? Fuck me.

Tucker did great here but Tariq did better, he destroyed his own narrative without Tucker having to even do much. 

He wrote a race bating ambiguous tweet, gets called out, then back pedals on all of it and calls Tucker a liar for calling him out. Rofl.
Fuck off cunt.
Amazing stuff. The racist moron was almost crying at the end, and knew he had lost long before ever he opened his mouth, so he of course accused the whole network of white supremacy. Of course.
Tariq is the definition of delusional 
I love How Tucker does not even have to challenge this cuck at the end, Nasheed is just to fucking stupid and listening to him speak makes Tuckers point.
tuck's juiciest roasting yet!
#RACE CASINO
How does Tucker keep a straight face talking to these people.
So, we're all racist then. Original.
Holy shit Liberals are 100% bone deep ignorant. Tariq is a disgusting bigot. 
#Tariq = Rat IQ
Currently recording this interview with the flag burner. I'll have that uploaded after it's finished.

[EDIT: Here you go, folks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj7pBrs8f_Y)
Tucker is one of the best personalities on Fox
This was hilarious to watch. Tucker ain't no cucker that's for sure.
Just saw live. That sweating was the biggest "I'm full of shit" sign ever! I wish Tucker kept him on longer...
Tariq completely lacks any level of awareness. A true poster-child of the persecution complex. If anyone ever asks me why I voted for Trump I will show them this video. When you can't form a coherent sentence without accusing someone of being a white supremacist, you may have an actual, diagnosable, condition.
This guy Tariq is fucking cancer.

uhhh, of the top of my head.


black people can vote. they can marry whites without being hung. they can go to the same schools. use the the same facilities. 


????


this is one of the dumbest mother fuckers ive heard. says a bunch of shit, and when directly asked about it starts spouting shit off like a broken record about MUH WHITE SUPREMACY. 
He didn't have anything to say at all. Seems like the only reason he came on the show was to distance himself from his own tweet without actually having to apologize. Well, fuck you too.
C
CNN : White supremacist organization Fox News's white supremacist host attacks concerned black man. 
Here's the thing about Tucker that I applaud the most, and that very, very, very few talk show hosts have the balls to do: He'll always bring people on his show that don't agree with him (and he always smacks them down). But it takes nerve to bring these people on your show that are pretty obviously part of the problem 
Who the fuck is more based right now, Hannity or Tuck?
not sure how it was even mathematically possible at this point, but Tariq Nasheed made himself look like a bigger fool than he already was. One of you centipedes surely is an engineer or mathematician, we need to run the numbers.
Tariq went full retard long ago
I just made pizza and the yeast fucked up and the dough didn't rise and I thought the entire night was ruined..

Is he stupid or does he think that we are that stupid?
Tuck the Cuck Slayer! Never fails to BTFO cucks. 
Tuck's bert stare is fucking classic. 
"It was a statement it wasn't even my opinion."

Someone needs to make a book of all the idiotic justifications these people use when called on their bullshit.

Rotund Rosie's "I actually thought he has autism cuz I know the signs" would be the top one so far I think.
This motherfucker....
HAHAHAHA this is gold
Love how Tucker says goodbye to this race hustling idiot and cuts his mic.  He tries to get in one last hustle but you just see him soundlessly flapping his mouth as his box shrinks and dissapears
I love how Tucker shut down the guys "false narrative" quote.  It's a lazy way to make it seem like they scored a point on you.  Always shut it down.
The ignorance, anger and racism that lives within Tariq is the result of that racism being taught and nurtured for generations by a culture that cannot accept responsibility for its own failures.

Never have I seen someone so far off the truth. Tariq is a waste of space.
That was hard to watch.... I think tucker was so shocked by the stupidity of this guy 
Typical liberal trying to deny what he did. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING.
This guy is insufferable! How much backpedalling can someone do and still think his point still holds any merit?

He seems a little unhinged.  
Tuck will run out of guests soon, dudes brutal. Loving it.
Masochist need only apply.
Man, tucker is gold. Just his deadpan  facial expression cracks me up. 
Wow. Tuck's face the whole time!!!!!!!
Tariq Nasheed is a big bucket of retardation.
He's practicing Taqiyya. Historically the muslims have been the most savage when it comes to war tactics. They use EVERY side of life for war. Jihad also includes reproduction like we see in Europe, as well as Taqiyya, which is defined in the Quran as "lying to protect islam". It instructs Muslims to keep praising tolerance and acceptance when feeling threatened or in the minority. This guy is a Muslim, he is practicing Taqiyya. Deport.

spez - basically all liberal elites have been using Taqiyya if you think about it, albeit without the same purpose in the end. And their followers brainwashed into believing it all. Saudis probably taught them. Its so cruel, they know we are most sensitive (Europe, fuck yeah, we are the biggest pussies everrrr!) when being criticised of being intolerant. But they have 0 respect for us. They think we are idiots. They know this excuse works on us every time as well. The Quran guarantees them that. They think of Western women especially as animals and the men as weak. 
I'm just glad Tucker is on our side!
Liberalism is a mental disease.
It's like this where I live. The gap between two sides is massive. Plan Obama successful.
Man everything is always about race to the left isn't it?
> "I'm not making this about race, you white supremacist."
Tariq is the pigeon knocking over chess pieces, shitting on the board, and pretending he won the game
I love how his expression is just so calm while Tariq is forced to argue for his own racist views. He then ends up projecting his views by calling Tucker and the entire network white supremacists lol
He is on fire tonight. LOL @ this flag burner.
OMG I have a lady boner just thinking about watching this. 
holy shit the man-child he just interviewed. what a piece of shit

Dear god. This man is delusional
Tucker whooped him so bad Kunta Kinte felt it.
/r/tucker_carlson
I love Tucker Carlson. Pretty sure that if I saw him in person I would fangirl myself into a heart attack.

But seriously, I really respect him. He puts up with a lot of BS for the purpose of saying what really needs to be said and heard.

And I <3 his "I just won this shit" smirk. Every time.
Tariq Nasheed answers EVERY QUESTION with YOU ARE A WHITE SUPREMACIST!!! WHAT A BRAINLESS ROBOT. 
I like how Tucker constantly looks dumbfounded at the ignorance of his guests. 
"if you'd ever stepped outside"

HA!
I can't watch, that racist asshole is just gonna piss me off.
WTF is wrong with people. Tariq Nasheed may be the most racist person on TV. That guy is a race baiting racist cuck. 

Fuck him! üñïüèΩ
The sad part is that Tariq Nasheed is probably looked at as the next Albert Einstein by the liberals lol. 
That was painful to watch
**His Name is Tucker Carlson, American Hero**
Tucker is savage
I love how this asshole tries to rid himself of all responsibility of the tweet right after Tucker calls him out. 
"I think when normal people - I'm excluding you from that category - watch what happened yesterday they didn't see the race of the terrorist or the race of the cop..."

Good lord btfo. 
Don't be a pig, Mark.

Typical white supremacist Tucker...giving a black guy national air time...
Why do these leftists accept to go on his program to be publicly humiliated? Are they just unaware or are so full of themselves that they just don't realize what is going on?
It's like we got our own talkshow.
I was losing faith in Fox a few weeks ago... not anymore.
Why would a man like Tariq even agree to come on a show like this? Does he not know you cannot cuck the Tuck?
And they call us racist.  Lmao.
Tucker is so good. He has all the facts and uses those to guide his arguments but what makes him special is that he can match these cucks' 100mph barrage of bs with his quick coherent responses so they never get the satisfaction of feeling like they just shouted and won.

Truly a cuck slayer 
Ironically Tariq comes off as a black supremacist. 
This guy reacts the same way HRC reacts when she lies. STUTTER STUTTER STUTTER.

Tucker is my new hero since I started watching him after Nov 8.  Tonight he brow beat the flag burning advocate so viciously I almost felt bad for the guy.  Almost.  Can't cuck the Tuck!
I  love how that fuck got cut off at the very end.
##IFIFIFIFIFIFIFIFIFIFIFIFIF OKIE DOKE
TIL Tariq Nasheer is a passive aggressive liar. We all know exactly the underhanded snarky shit he was implying by using "white" and "black" to highlight an "officer shooting".

I despise disingenuous racist fucks like this.

And he thought he could slip it past Tucker Carlson who wasn't buying the bullshit Nasheer was selling.

Current Year +1 is going to be AWESOME!
If I can make one critique it would be for Tucker to close his mouth when waiting for someone to stop speaking, it's not very alpha to wait on the end of your words for another man to be finished. President Trump makes a point of keeping his mouth extra closed with his signature raised bottom lip stern expression.
Okay, I'm not even going to categorize this guy with liberals, he might actually be retarded. Wow, that hurt to watch.

I can't succeed in this country as a self-identified trisexual attack helicopter because  of white supremacy, therefore I must force everyone else to subsidize me to make up for the inequality. 
All this does is give people like him more reason to post that nonsense just to get on fox. 
[Same guy that tweeted out this gem.](http://i.imgur.com/bNThJPG.png)
Either I or Tariq are retarded. Because I cannot follow his train of though at all.
[deleted]
At the very end, Tariq called Tucker a "suspected white supremacist".  KEK.  Tariq is the biggest race-baiting pile of shit out there.  And I bet after it was over, he and all of his friends think he won, right?
Jesus, this guy is an idiot.  He calls EVERYONE a racist.  I don't understand how he is so popular.  
Jokes on you all, dummies:  BLACKS CANT BE RACIST DUH
That was hard to watch. It's like for Tariq every single unpleasant thing in the universe is the result of white supremacy. I think he's spouted this lie so much (since he makes a living out of it) that he's completely brainwashed even himself.
Why even give this dufus airtime? Why would I take anyone who wrote "The Art of Mackin'" seriously?
"why would a white supremacist country import non whites and pay for them to live here?"

"actually there are hispanics that are considered white"


what did he mean by this?
I give Tariq respect for coming in the lions den. Don't mess with Tuck
##COULD WE PLEASE DEPORT GERALDO TO CNN AND GET HIM THE FUCK OFF OF FOX.

My wife never pays attention and is always on Facebook while I watch the news but she couldn't believe how based Tucker is. She was like, isn't that the guy from the morning show? He's killing that racist dude. 
[Here's Tucker's interview with the flag burner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj7pBrs8f_Y)
#**üö®WHITEüö®SUPREMACISTüö®ALERTüö®**
This Tariq guy is an imbecile. He claims that he didn't make the issue racial with that tweet. What a joke that is! What if I described this interview as: *White* journalist paraded around as uncuckable for refuting *Black* man's points.
That makes this a racial issue when it is simply a journalist named Tucker Carlson exposing an idiot for being an idiot.
Watched this.  What an idiot.  
This is the best show I've ever seen. Next to Hannity 
in this same episode he does a really good interview with Rand Paul. Rand was low key begging for the secretary of state spot 
This might be one of the stupidest people on earth.  Why would they even give airtime to this race baiting dude.

He keeps going off topic, ignoring Tucker's questions etc.

Great job by Tucker not getting into a yelling and screaming match about nothing, which is what this dude tried to instigate.  Stick to the topic.
God this guy is stupid as hell. Him agreeing that times haven't changed since 1955 shows his stupidity alone. 
I hate to say it but Tucker might be more based than the Hannipede...
lol at the fact cucks willingly go to his show to be roasted.
When Tariq first started giving his side of the story, Tucker has this look on his face like "I can't believe I'm hearing this shit"
MFW You can't win by calling everything racist anymore :((((
I just watched all the clips on youtube. I love watching these moron liberal crybabies fall apart when he starts hitting them with logic. The best one is the one with the dumbass Internet marketing guy. Holy shit what an idiot
Jesus. He just erased that guy from existence!
Jesus Farking Christ. Cognitive dissonance, massive projection, manipulation and misuse of vocabulary, agressive ad hominem in response to pointed questions, literal deafness to facts, and outright lying - this guy just displayed everything that is wrong with the Ctrl-Left in less 7 minutes. I'm actually kind of impressed.


Also, the shit-eating grin that Tucker has when the guest is vomiting up word salad, literally warms my aorta.
so is that isis news channel fakenews or no?
Tareek of ignorance 
[Tariq claims he "destroyed" Tucker in his interview](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/803774457537916928).  The man is clearly delusional.
Lol, towards the end he was answering every question with a question...also it was funny how Tucker asks "Why would a white supremacist nation pay for a African Muslim immigrant to live and go to school here?" The Response: "So we don't live in a system of complete white supremacy? Everybody's lying Tucker?" and than follows with "that's what I thought" when Tucker trying to figure out how to even respond to that..
"So we don't live in a system of complete white supremacy?"

Barack Obama has been the president for eight years. WTF?
From a pro Tariq article. Written by a fifth grader:

Suspect white supremacist Fox News host invited activist and critically acclaimed filmmaker Tariq Nasheed on his program to debate current issues. Tucker immediately tried to resort to the usual Fox News sabotage tactics they are known to use on guest. But this time those tactics did not work because Nasheed articulately shut down Carlson‚Äôs racial rhetoric.

The interview started off with Tucker spewing several lies that he attributed to Nasheed. Nasheed promptly corrected him on those lies, and Carlson responded with rude commands directed at Nasheed.

When Carlson appeared to be losing intellectual ground with Nasheed, Carlson was reduced to engaging in spewing child-like personal insults. The producers at Fox News also incorrectly labeled Nasheed a ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter Activist‚Äù, when he has repeatedly stated he has nothing to do with the organization.

At several points in the interview, Carlson‚Äôs arguments where shut down so fast, he was literally at a loss for words.



 
I wonder if there is a single second in that guys life that he wasn't thinking about race.  I know when you base your career on creating racial division its easy...but fuck this guy has to be the most race obsessed person ive ever seen.

Everyones a white supremacist to this guy...everything happens in his eyes based on race....there isnt any room in this guys brain for anything other than making racial observations.

This guy is the reason were a divided country.  This guy is why the media and politics is so toxic.  This guy is the problem, no fucks given if people think im a racist for saying that...the word has lost all meaning to me. Like many words used as weapons by the left, it has long ago detached from the dictionary definition and is now whatever the fuck they want it to be...and im not playing that game.
Tucker is SPOT ON when he calls out Tariq's statement as 'cowardly'. You can see exactly what Tariq's plan was if he was called out for that statement. Tariq chose to use 'that's interesting' so that if someone called him out he could say "I just thought it was interesting, why do you think I hated the cop/sympathized with the terrorist? All I was saying is it was interesting". He doesn't even have the fucking balls to come out and say his racist/anti-cop feelings.
"It's a much more complicated landscape which you may have noticed if you go outside."
I love staring at Tucker's face when the other person starts talking. He just stares into their soul.
Black President, one Black Attorney General left office one Black Attorney General now, Black Congress people, Black Mayor's, Black Official's and Black Rich people...
...how the hell is the US a white supremacist country?!?!?!  
That guy is a looney.
#CANTCUCKTUCK

I absolutely love Tuck's "are you fucking kidding me" face:
https://sli.mg/4ci2Zo
Best moment from Tucker:

#"I'm not even going to rise to the bait-"
r/cringe

Disclaimer: I'm not saying the attacker in this case is not a terrorist and did not intend to create fear and panic with a political motive.

However, it is not true or accurate or helpful to call every person who attempts or succeeds in attacking or killing a group of people a terrorist. Tucker says something like "the guy attacked people with a knife, what else do you need to know to say he's a terrorist?" and that is just not correct. Labeling every violent or deranged criminal as a terrorist is a tactic the media uses to instill lasting fear into the public, to the advantage of the media and politicians.

A terrorist is "a person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims" and terrorism is "the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims." To call any deranged violent criminal is to misuse and cheapen the term for dubious and backhanded reasons, in the case of the media.

If the Trump crowd is against mainstream media, against the system, or against globalism they should be against these fear mongering tactics because they are repeatedly used to restrict personal freedom and expand central power.
Nasheed is, and always has been, a delusional, racist asshat.
I just don't understand why there are people out there who's sole goal is to keep us all divided like this. How can everyone not see this ?!? Of course this wasn't a racial matter...fucking Christ this sub is showing me stupidity on so many different fronts.

Do people like this seriously exist ? What happened to critical thinking ? My god I'm so glad I have no desire to raise a child in this world. 
Tariq Nasheed is a mess.

Sad!
This reminds me of the woman who made the video about the dallas cop killer being a martyr, then goes on TV and says she didn't mean he was a martyr.

Can't fix stupid.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzzMEwf1GW4
WHY would he go on this show!
Tariq is a racist, but since he's black and has an Islamic name, it's ok.  

What the fuck is going on with people? 
Why won't you let me spew my nonsense?

I contractually  obligated to say white supremacy at least six times every five minutes
Same Facial Expression from Tucker in the preview. Tariq must be saying something incredbily stupid.
"I think when normal people, I'm excluding you from that category, watch what happened yesterday...."

Slaughter.
THAT GUY IS A FUCKING NUTJOB. Does he want people to be racist??? Hes INSANE. 
[removed]
I heard about this guy this morning and when I heard he was gonna be on tuck the uncuckable I was so happy, my freedom boner is rock hard right now
And now he is talking to the dick bag who says burning a flag is a right, and "Americans have a right to be despicale" smh 
It was almost cruel to even bring Tariq on.
when you stutter and say "you know" every third word, YOU HAVE LOST THE GAME. (this guy on The Tuck right now. HOLY FUCK THIS ASSHOLE IS FUCKING RETARDED!!!!!! Trump "wants" us to burn the flag. Are you KIDDING ME right now? This fucker can barely form words. FUCK!

edit: Mark perkel "www.flagburning.org". WTF.
A stuttering mess.

IF Tariq Nasheed's podcasts aren't racialized, what the hell are they?
Ten reasons why Tucker Carlson is a white supremacist 
1.REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Talks like a duck, walks like a duck, looks like a duck. But I didn't call it a duck!!!!
Aww he tried so hard so very hard.
"think deeply about what you're saying". I LOVE THE TUCK.

##CANNOT FUCK THE TUCK
"Not to blow your mind, Tariq." LMAO
Almost as much greasy sweat on that guy as Cenk from TYT. Almost...
This is my reaction to listening to Tariq's "arguments"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkodTydUR0E&ab_channel=TightHelluv
He stumped himself.
How do I find me one of them race casinos?
ISIS news agency? Does he mean CNN?
Capital B in black, lower case w in white...classy guy, so subtle!
He looks like a nervous wreck.
WOW. Just...wow. There's no words. Well, maybe a few. Tariq is a retard.
Tariq is the personification of everything that is wrong with the left. 
Wow.
I used to hate Carlson, thought he was a loud mouthed know nothing pundit. But he seems to have turned around lately. It might be because the left has gone full retarded and it's really easy to make them look like idiots though. 
"No you got it , you suspected white supremacists are very smart ".  Wow mr. Nasheed ....so would you consider us....supreme?
I know I was listening to him on my drive home from school... I knew  instantly who he was talking to even without hearing his name... the Tariq guy came across as unhinged.
I'm not sure why, but I think I took Tucker slightly more seriously back when he wore the bow tie.
"even our misguided friends". 

WHY IS GERALDO SUCH A CUCK?!?!
Mmmm cuck soup. He should have stuck to crying on twitter.
They have to do something about the 5 second lag between Tucker talking and the guest hearing, because it ruins the flow when they have to keep pausing to hear each other.  Other shows/stations don't seem to have the same problem, so I'm not sure why his show has such a noticeable problem with it. 
hey geraldo: just got a call from inside Capone's vault. THEY FOUND YOUR DIGNITY.
"not to blow your mind tariq" LMAO was that a black magic joke?
Tucker: Why would a white supremacist country import Africans in large numbers and then pay for them to live here? It doesn't really fit your narrative, does it?

Tariq: So we don't live in a system of white supremacy? Everybody is lying, Tucker?

Tucker (looking astonished): Huh.

*[pauses]*

*[begins to rephrase question]*

Tariq: That's what I thought.

The best part is that Tariq probably thinks he won the entirety of the exchange.
Check out the idiot safe opener Geraldo on right now. Jesus Christ what a fool. 
Someone needs to edit in the Halo voiceover guy saying "Suicide" after Tariq gives the race casino line.
The worst part? There are fools out there that will think this Tariq fucktard actually made a coherent point...
People like Tariq who keep race baiting are what made me into a somewhat racist person today.  
Wow is he really that blind.
Friends Heed Tariq's warning!! ONE of the major signs of a possible suspected  White supremacist:  they're very smart.  You'll know right away!  Smart white male= RACIST
I can't wait to see how this sub digests the Geraldo bit... "I'll bet he did!" re: Manson made me fall off my chair. 

Geraldo seemed to be arguing that some horrible people are *just okay* because of their personal charm, while being interviewed by him. He always name-drops the Beatles, but here it was used in service of Castro.
This dude just got served. 
Im sure his past history would make people say "that's interesting".  Loser
hey mike evans: HA HA HA HA HAAAA. STILL PISSED THAT HILLARY CUNTON LOST, EH?!
Can someone put a crying Jordan over this guy's face?
I saw that, Tariq came across as a very stupid person.  All Tucker has to do is ask pointed questions and this guy falls apart.
what a goddamn clown. 
That "WTF are you talking about look" Tucker gives people like this ought to be fucking trade marked. It's fantastic. 
he got stumped harder than a grinder
Honestly I am impressed that Tariq had the nuts to appear on the news about this after tweeting something so fantastically stupid.   

Edit: NVM he just pretended he didn't say it, what a coward.
I love how people like Tariq Nasheed will continually hurl the same tired, overly broad blanket statements thinking they just proved something.
Tariq seems like the kinda guy who would graffiti "Sharpton 4 Prez" onto abandoned buildings.
He got BTFO and didn't even know it lmao
I thought Tariq started off ok, but sheesh... did he fucking ever go off the deep end. Wow. 
Interviewed? You mean "obliterated"?
Wtf, this guy is a moron holy shit. 
Oh my.  That was as embarrassing as I expected.  Was he high or just very very nervous?  It's crazy how liberals are showing their true colors in all their insanity.
Wow fox news is actually starting to get it.  Putting in a news anchor that is conservative and has a backbone!!  Who would have ever thought people would want to watch that?  Its almost like its the best show on fox news and hes only been on a week.  


This show delivers segment after segment night after night.
What did Tariq say at the end? He says something after his mic gets cut and they change to the next story.
I almost wanted to fight him for saying crazy stuff about Tucker. 
What a pussy.  Defend your position; don't just say you "made a statement" and that was it.  I think the problem is that he doesn't have a legitimate argument to make.  This fool is getting too much attention anyway.  He'll probably be teaching at Harvard soon.
I think he sent out the initial tweet when he saw Somalian in the headline and the shooter was white. He thought this was a white on back thing, the dumbass didn't have a CLUE that most Somalians are muslim. Like that never crossed his mind, he saw Somalian and just saw a black person. Then when it blew up he had to dig the heels in and double down, only to look that idiot we already knew he was!


Reading through his twitter feeds shows that this racist mother fucker has been making his living by race-baiting & racial divisiveness https://twitter.com/tariqnasheed. 
Can we address the fact that nobody gets that stupid without a lifetime of caregivers telling you "you're a victim of white supremacy?" It's fucking tragic, he has no self agency and will be totally penniless when his race goes off the best selling list. 
Whoa.  listening to the hate spewed from this mans mouth gives me the the shivers.  Pretty sad how much he hates.  

as they love to throw around the word weaponised, i think this guy has weaponized stupidity.

the is no logic here, how can a news site report on a black islamic somali terrorist without saying black somalian islamic terrorist? you can't and if you did it would be highly disingenuous. lol at the guy saying tucker was playing the race card HOW CAN YOU HAVE SUCH LITTLE SELF AWARENESS???? HOW!?! 

you just cant argue through all that grease from that massive chip on his shoulder, you just cant argue when one side uses zero facts and just uses his feeling of how race relations are. god i need to chill for abit after watching that
Hypocritical pieces of trash.  
did this basketcase *seriously* just mouth **WHITE POWER!** after they cut his audio feed and the interview was concluded?

Tariq seems like a smart dude. It's a shame that this is how he chooses to fight for justice and equality (maybe closer to equity, but I'm willing to look past that for the sake of this argument). Absolute shame. He could be better than this; he chooses not to be. This can't be- in any way, shape, or form- confused for mature, intelligent political discourse. This was just below the second presidential debate- and that bar's pretty damn low.

Props to Tucker for at least trying to keep it together after being slanderously attacked on his own show.

e: clarification and a few other thoughts after I confirmed that he did indeed mouth "white power" somewhere in the rant he began before the video feed was terminated
Holy shit I thought for sure that was a /pol/ puppet account. The guy actually exists?
#FUCKING CLOWN SHOES
is white supremacy a new roundabout way of saying someone is racist but without having to prove they are? i swear i have barely heard that word used much until the past year?
Holy shit, I couldn't even watch half of this video. You can't discuss or debate with people like this.
Moonbat loser
What

>Suspected white supremacists are very smart

LOL
"They mention he was a black Somali immigrant [because it's true] and BLM [huh?] and white supremacy [gtfo]"  
Isn't a nasheed a song that ISIS plays before detonating their vests in their propaganda videos?
Some news program should ask him to come on, and when he does, the host can say 'Tonight we are talking to Tariq Nasheed - Tariq you are probably one of the dumbest people we are aware of and we wont waste any of our viewers time talking to you - Thanks!' and then cut his feed.
Wow. Tucker fucking destroyed this rambling moron. 
Tucker is white supremacist confirmed 
Tucker so far has been very professional and well spoken on his new show. I am very impressed.
This guy, what a fuckwit. Wew.  "I'm not trying to racialize this issue." I spent all afternoon listening to your podcast and it's the most racialized thing I've ever heard.  BOOM +420 stumped.. You're just going to project your supposed white supremacists views..  
Dude got soooo triggered soo fast. I wonder if he's that quick with his wifes bull.
i don't think words sufficiently exist to describe how badly this guy got owned 
MFW Tucker says this guy's podcast was the most race baiting thing he ever heard, the guy vehemently denies it, then ends the interview by calling literally everyone including Tucker and everyone at Fox News white supremacists...
"How are we a "white supremacist" country when we bring in these Somalians and educate them for free and pay their way in every other sense?"  
  
".... *wheels turn* WHITE SUPREMACY!"   
  
Thanks, you've just proven the alt-right correct. Idiot.
One point I disagree with. He asks, "If you drive your car through a crowd of people and murder someone with a knife, are you not a terrorist?"

Well no, that in itself is not terrorism. Terrorism is using violence to push a political agenda. That's the missing thing there. 
The only one bringing race into this is Tariq or whatever his name is. I can't even do anything but laugh at the shit coming out of his mouth. 
Omg the race casino?? How long did he spend fapping off to come up with that?? Bout as long as hill did with "trumped up trickle down"
Sadly, somehow this guy is influential, and there are people out there who think he is smart and take his word as gospel. How did we get here? Sad.
I love the deadpan Tuckface, with only the slightly furrowed brow betraying a hint of concern and incredulity. 

My initial reaction to his race baiting comments were to jump on his twitter and maybe tweet something snarky, but instead I'm just going to start ignoring the race baiting people altogether.  They *want* the replies, it keeps them in business.  

Fuck 'em, we're going to ride this train to a better place.

spez: TUCKER IS A BEAST
I love how they mute this idiot out as he says "Black Lives Matters" right at the end... you can read the lips.
"Not to blow your mind". I died when he said that. And that grin at the end... lmao.
Watched it earlier. Tariq couldn't thread his talking points. Just a bunch of Rambling...like he learned to formulate sentences last month. 
I used to dislike The Tuck.

But then my testicles descended. 
I can't listen to this Tariq dude, SHUT THE FUCK UP
What the fuck did I just listen to from that black man
I love this man. Give him the 7-9 and then O'Riley at 9-10, then Hannipede
I couldn't stop smiling through the whole thing. That was fucking cathartic.

I knew it would be good right from the "Oh, of course" from Tucker.

Seriously, I'm still grinning. Send help, it's not going away.
Just like Obama after the first debate with Romney, I am sure this imbecile Nasheed walked out of that studio pumping his fist and congratulating himself on having taken Carlson to school.
I'm a "benefit of the doubt" kind of guy. Twitter is not the best platform for expressing yourself, and I thought that Tariq might be more persuasive and interesting in a live interview.

He had nothing. He lost his composure immediately. He didn't cite one fact, nor bring up one logical point that might have changed one mind. He didn't come across as the least bit erudite. All he could do was sling mud. Very disappointing.
I've been in similar arguments but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. People say things that have strong implications and say "it doesn't say that" when I try to point it out. So what do I do when someone clearly implies dumb stuff (like race being important in this scenario)? I just get told that I am inferring stuff that is not there. My best guess would be to bet them that if surveyed, people in general would agree with me, but I don't know a better way.
#REKT
**Uncucker Carlson**
Oh my God how is it physically possible for one person to spew so much bullshit. I'm at a loss for words to describe how disgusted I am with Tariq Nasheed and anyone who believes his mountain of lies.

God bless you Tucker Carlson for bringing the hammer down on this asshole.
he starts backpedaling before he even opens his mouth, what a joke
Oh my gosh, this Tariq guy is like a parody of himself. 
He needs to have a cabinet position!
Is this delusion of is this guy just so extremely dumb (or both)?

I mean, the race of the police officier does literally not matter if he didn't act out of some race-related motive.

The race of the one who acts illegally does matter. While it's not okay to blame a group of people for what some individuals did, it's still the right of the people to know the facts about the attacker. And if a group of people was extremely overrepresented in crime, the people would be able to act upon that information, in the limits of what the law allows. And that's exactly what the proposed extreme-vetting of muslim immigrants is.

Alan Horujko stopped a murdering asshole, and that's his fucking job as a police officier. Even if Alan was the most racist person on earth, which I'm sure he isn't, that wouldn't change a thing in this case, because even racists can kill someone of the race they hate for legitimate reasons. If I was Mexican and I hated Chinese people, how would that prevent situations where I legitimately had to kill a Chinese guy in self-defense? It doesn't, it could still happen.

And yes, putting yourself in danger to help/save people, that's what makes you a hero. That's probably what Alan did.

And it's obviously not a stabbing suspect, if he runs around with a bloody knife and you know that people were stabbed moments ago in the same place.

And what's the "false narrative" he's talking about? He had the chance to explain his position, but he just didn't.

> So we don't live in a system of complete white supremacy? Everybody is lying Tucker?

Tucker should have seriously answered that with "Exactly!"
Tariq is a race-baiting turd who crumbles under pressure.

Oh my god this guy has to be the dumbest person I think I've ever listened to. Jesus Christ, how did Tucker put up with him for that long? 
Wow. Carlson just earned a new fan. I almost wish I still had cable to watch this daily.
So, he definitely flipped the camera off at the 45 second mark.
Great composure from the Tuck while the Cuck begins the typewriter ebonObabble in a vain attempt to dislodge the facts. Tuck it!
That might be one of the biggest douchebag Dum Dums I've ever seen in my life
Funny, I read his book "the mack within" when I was in high school (in order to get laid, obviously). It was fucking garbage. All he did was talk about different kinds of pimps and hood rats.
I just can't get over the look on this dude's face when he is listening to fucking nonsense. 
Lol the face Tucker makes everytime a leftist cucks goes full retard on his show is so good and always the same.
"Right. Okay. I'm missing the thread of your argument."

Where has based Tucker Carlson been all muh liiiiiiiiiife?
"Why would White Supremacists import Africans and pay for them to go to school here?" LMAO
I have a better intellectual conversations with my dog than this fool. 
Lmao @ the end when his mic had been cut and he tried to yell his final incoherent statement 
HAHAHAHAHA that ending though. He was ready to spew more racial bullshit and tucker just muted him. 

#GET TUCKED, CUCKS.
WOW honestly asking how this country is any different than it was in 1955
that shrug at https://youtu.be/GKUU4l1TmJU?t=109
The whole show was gold.
Tariq is undoubtedly the type of man to resort to violence if he was in person. He's one of those people who get violent when they start to lose.
All the leftists talking heads careers are in the toilet and Tuck Cuckyouson' is a fucking god among men after like 5 episodes.
Tariq is the most racist fuck I've ever heard. 

How the fuck does this useless asshole have a voice?


Seriously guys we're winning this cultural war so hard I'm afraid it will swing too much the other way again.
Tucker shouldn't be giving this nut job airtime imo.
So much idiocy. 
Damn, this Tariq guy had his argument going nowhere.  
Well it was kind of a checkmate to start with so i dont blame him.  
'PEDES, NEVER ACT LIKE THIS TARIQ GUY.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

'Nasheed' means in Arabic an Islamic hymn or song.

[For example this song is a nasheed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQoJvI8XUa0)
>I'm not going to rise to the bait.

fucking kek
Tariq is blasting his twitter with this video saying he "destroyed" Tucker...how, exactly?
>not to blow your mind Tariq 



BTFO!
what a scumbag
lol isis at the end

WAS ME GUYS
This is the first one of these Tucker videos I couldnt finish. When he asked why he put quotes around terrorists and guy started stammering I had enough.
I lose it every time tucker drops a "yeah" so funny 
"I wasn't racializing!"

Then why the **FUCK** would you specifically include "black" and "white" in your tweet, you fucking mongoloid?
I HAD TO HURRY AND GO MAKE SOME POPCORN BEFORE I WATCHED THIS BECAUSE I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA BE GOOOOOOOOD
This one struck a cord with Tucker.  He's normally not this aggressive.
I think we need a meme with Tucker's face.  That expression is classic Tucker!  üòØüòØüòØüòØüòØ
Ugh I really hate that Tariq dude.  So glad we have all the based brothas on our side.  
Officer is a hero and also has a cool name, case closed. 
Is this /r/cringe? Where am I?
You can't fucker the Tucker!
Tucker's "what the fuck" face üòçüòçüòç
This guy just made me so angry.
Where does he find these people?
Late to the party and this will be buried but I honestly had no idea that the terrorist was black until watching this video.  I heard that a college student was slinging knives so I imagined sperglord basement dweller flailing a katana, not a Somalian brandishing a cutlass.
Ladies and Gents, this is called cognitive dissonance.
Did I just watch someone call a violent criminal terrorist a "hero"?

Really!? A man kills innocent Americans with a car and a bladed weapons... Is a hero? WTF

Is the left this insane or am I just stuck in a weird timeline. How the... Wtf... I can't... 
What Tariq Nasheed meant by his tweet is that only white cops get attention as heroes.  Tariq was implying that if the cop was black, he wouldn't be hailed as a hero.  That is my take.  It's stupid and unfounded, but that was my take.  Tariq never says that in the interview, so maybe not.
"I think when normal people, I'm excluding you from that category..." 

REKT
I cannot stop laughing at the flair for this post.  
Oh my god the "Tucker Face"! 
I wonder if Tucker Carlson could talk to my dad...
Apparently if you're white and smart you're a suspected white supremacist.
I LOVE TUCKER, HE'S GOT THE BALLZ TO CALL BULLSHIT ON STUPID PUNDITS AND JOURNOS. I ONLY WISH HE COULD GET ABC, NBC, CBS AND CNN REPORTERS AND ANCHORS ON TO DEFEND THEIR DISINGENUOUS NARRATIVES
Nasheed is clearly racist, and in denial of it. Shameful.
Terrorist Sympathizer Tariq Nasheed
Tariq is absolutely insane 
The amount of ignorance and stupidity coming from the guest is just insane. You can just tell he's a huge racist by the way he goes about saying just about everything and his opinions on everything   
Tucker. Incredible, systematic dismantling of this guy.
Tucker Carlson makes me wish I hadn't gotten rid of TV.    I wish he had a radio program!!!
Don't even try to go onto Tariq's Facebook page, he shared the video acting like HE WON! OMG, then the comments underneath are even worse. 
Lol 
Tariq: "you're not even listening" 
Tucker: "no... I'm not"
This guy's level of cuckery is astronomical! 
I don't understand why people still come on this show when they look dumb as shit when tuck is done fucking them.
> Stopped the killer

Can we get a fact check on that Evan?

Actually Tucker he merely attempted to kill people, he failed at this, just like everything else he ever attempted in life.
I love the clips I get here. I don't have cable, so I can't watch the show live :(

How is he going to continue finding liberals willing to appear on his show? This guy was heated even before the interview began. I would think they would just stop appearing on the show.
The cuck slayer
Holy MAGA, i thought Tim Kaine was bad and this guy shows up. 
If been raging about this for an hour 
I've recently been watching many Tucker Carlson clips. He usually destroy the leftist that are featured on his program
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c
What's so wrong with 1955? Tucker cucked a little. He's still light years ahead of when I first saw him years ago.

BTW, nice flight of ideas by Tariq Nasheed. And LMAO at his acting like Tucker should have understood his non sequitur.
People like this guy are only trying to divide and destroy our country. It's so sad. That's one of the most ignorant people I've ever seen. 
5:15

"2/10 bait, made me reply"
Tariq raises some good points (he doesn't)
Tucker's "What the fuck is he saying" face is priceless.
Just commenting so I can watch this later
Suspected white supremacists are very smart?
.
Watching this guy defend himself is like watching a child take on a semi truck, Tuck is straight savage
What a sad interview. Very scary what mindset people have and try to force to create fear. 

Tucker did great as always. 
Bahahahahahahahahahaha.... bahahahahaha!!!!!

I had a good friend who started listening to Tariq Nasheed religiously and wound up accusing me of being a white supremacist in every single argument we would have regarding politics etc. At a certain point I had to cut him loose because I realized that no matter how good my argument was, backed with facts (which are all populated by white supremacists according to him) and reasoning he would just default to sticking his fingers in his ears and yelling RACISM! 

This video proves very well that not only does Nasheed know exactly what he was trying to imply with his tweets but that he doesn't give a single shit about being a race baiter all while crying racism. 
I like how confused he looks when his guests say something stupid
What did you mean by these tweets?

**ARAYCISSAYSWHAT?!**

I'm not sure I follow you...

**STOP BEING WHITE TUCKER!! STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE**


Oh my god. At the end of the "white supremacist country" segment, from 3:35 to 4:05, Carlson has just laid out reality in a plain little package for this guy and his defective brain tells him to say "So we *don't* live in a system of complete white supremacy? Everybody is lying, Tucker?"

And then Carlson responds with the exact amount of energy that this guy deserves.  "Huh."

Not "Huh. I hadn't considered that", but "Huh. This guy has made it this long while being this stupid and somehow hasn't managed to swallow his tongue. TIL"
**Tucker = Genius**
People actually think Tariq destroyed Tucker on his show. Shows how delusional the left is.
Destroyed
>Being a writer of vast books, some of his famous books include 'The Art of Mackin', The Mack Within, The Elite Way. He has also published few advice books for female readers which are "The Art of Gold Digging" and "Play or be played, what Every Female Should Know about Men, Dating, and Relationships".

Highest of all keks
Tariq Nasheed is the most racist person alive.  His paranoia and hatred of living beings that don't look EXACTLY like him is unbelievable.
Tucker Carlson is my new favorite television show. He was born for this role and is the type of show you would expect and want from a The_Donald television channel. I hope he crushes it in ratings.
#HIGH ENERGY
It was pretty obvious after that tweet the other day that this guy was a racist moron but I didn't realize just how stupid he really was.
Tucker is so based, Fox unleashed the beast on the left.
holy shit i've never seen someone so stupid.
THIS BLACK PIECE OF SHIT KNOWS HES LYING
TUCKER! I have a family friend/neighbor who may as well be an older twin brother. He looks, talks, and acts just like Tucker and I find it hilarious. Just the lighthearted beatdowns Tucker dishes out is just amazing.
"Tariq, I've been listening to your podcast all day and quite frankly it's the most racist thing I've ever heard"

CAN'T CUCK THE TUCK!
Holy fucking cocaine based
Why wasn't this guy around until now? This guy is appointment TV. He just hosts retarded liberals, lets them speak their gibberish while looking like he is having an aneurysm, then counter attacks them with pinpoint logic. Was he based during the campaign? 
What a massive fool kek
Well his career is over haha he just made himself look like an idiot 
Before seeing this racist asshole I did not hear the officer referred to as white and the terrorist as black. Guy is a total zero and living in a alternative universe.
He's a bloody coward without the courage to back up his "convictions".
>"This is the age of the complaining classes, whether they are lawyers, community activists, radical feminists, race-hustlers, or other squeaking wheels looking for oil. No society ever thrived because it had a large and growing class of parasites living off those who produce." (Thomas Sowell)
I mean....holy shit. This guy is beyond stupid and so full of hate and racism that it is just oozing out.
This guy is the biggest race baiting piece of shit. 10/10 punchable face
Carlson: You are implying there was [a racial motive]


Nasheed: I didn't say there was a racial motive


Carlson: Well, of course you did, you said..


Nasheed: *blinks heavily* I did say that.
This guy says a whole lot of nothing
I honestly cant even watch tucker carlson.  he eviscerates people so hard it is just awkward to watch lol
Hoooo hohoh that was..   .. üëåüëåüòÑüòÑ tucker is new bae. Seriously though, the look on his face is a perfect summary of my feelings towards watching that. I dont think tariq could have a single cohesive thought if he was reading it from a grade 2 story book. 
Tariq is going on about how Fox made it racial by pointing out that it was a black man shot by a white man, but he denied that his tweet was racial.

Huh. That's funny.
Just Google Tariq Nasheed and go a bit down the rabbit hole. It's fun.

You'll find all kinds of fun topics like the [Melanoid Nation Foundation](http://melanoidnation.org/), which appears to be developing new and cutting edge methods of race baiting, and the [Hidden Colors documentary film series](http://hiddencolorsfilm.com/), that is laugh out loud absurd in a funny, but also not funny at the same time, kind of way.  

If you don't want to click that second one, here are the titles:

Hidden Colors

Hidden Colors 2: The Triumph of Melanin

Hidden Colors 3: The Rules of Racism

Hidden Colors 4: The Religion of White Supremacy

All directed by and starring, you guessed it, Tariq Nasheed, the author of such classic books (yes, real books, [just check his bibliography on wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariq_Nasheed)) as:

The Art of Mackin' - a New York Times Bestseller

The Mack Within

The Art Of Gold Digging

This guy doesn't only bait race, he baits sexes as well.  

Truly DEPLORABLE.
Dude saying "not really" when Tucker said this isn't 1950 anymore lol.  Unbelievable.  Racism does not exist like they so desperately want it to.  
Bring back the bowtie Tucker!
[removed]
To be honest, I am racist against race baiters like Tariq Nasheed.
Tucker is pregnant!!

[removed]
I really dont like the Tariq guy one bit, nor do I agree with much of the content he says, but I have to say I think this was pretty shitty by Tucker here.  Everything Tucker did here was exactly what the left sided hosts do to right sided guests, which is kinda lulz in one regard but its also kinda a shitty thing to do.

Tucker could have easily shut this cuck down without these methods, just by asking him what he meant and pressing him on it, without throwing all all the other stuff he loads prior to the question.

I liked Carlson most of all the election, but it was TV like this (and Bengala) that made me hate CNN with shows like Crossfire.  Bill or hell, even Megyn would have interviewed this guy much more fairly and still would have destroyed him.
This was kinda embarrasing for Tucker if we are going to be honest. This leftist literally had Tuck at a loss for words because he could not think of a comeback. And Tuck kinda stumbled on this one. I think he should have done more research on this guy
He brings together people from all walks of life!
My household has **two** Priuses and all of us voted for Trump.  No bumper stickers though, we live in a blue county, liberals might use their key to express tolerance all over our cars.
I own a Prius! With Trump stickers on it too! 
Probably a hard worker who needs to save as much money on gas as he can in Obama's shit economy. 
Thats rarer than a sane liberal
WE HAVE THE BEST FUEL ECONOMY DON'T WE FOLKS?
#RARE
**Based Toyota owner**
I thought only he without sin could cast the first prius

I'd consider a unicorn to be a work truck with a Hillary sticker. DOESN'T EXIST!
#*REINCE HEADING TO WORK* 
Prius to trick and salt the neocons, while saving on Gas $$$. More for less! Corvettes, Suburbans, and Mustangs are cool, but Prius can do much more, *ahead of schedule, and under budget*.

Trump-Pence stickers to add salt to the liberal SJWs who think they're elite just for owning a Prius with their rusty Bernie/Hillary stickers. We can do it too!

#We're winning!
I have a Prius and let me tell you why.  The damn do gooders made the road from Virginia into DC (i66) HOV.  Then entire road!  And that is basically the road I need to travel to get to work. But because Prius is a special and magical vehicle, that vehicle was given an exception.  So those who have a Prius can drive the road as a solo occupant.

When I moved to DC, bought a cheap Prius just so I can get to work.
Never seen one in the wild before.
You wouldn't have seen this with Romney or McCain. Trump is a great unifier!
hey we're big trump supporters with a prius- cant beat the savings in gas 
All windows intact? RARE
Have you ever seen a Prius go past the speed limit? I don't think it's even possible.
I wonder if he's dealt with vandalism. That's the exact reason I never put any stickers on my car.
This is my dad (Not this car) But same premise. Fuck OPEC and so go Prius. 

He is also trying me to buy a Toyota because of their new Truck Plant in Texas and is really pissed off at Ford.  
Holy shit.

I thought Priuses came factory installed with Coexist, Okie Doke, and Crooked bumper stickers.
WE HAVE THE BEST UNICORNS, DONT WE FOLKS?
I'm glad you censored the license plate. If you hadn't then some peace activists would probably find this person and beat them to a pulp.
I drive a honda fit. It's baby blue. No apologies. 

Real men drive funny colored ultra-low emission compact cars!

And we want to MAGA!

#Grab em by the Prius
I can't tell what the one one the left is. Anyone know? 
TOP KEK
What's the rarity?  Is the one on the left a Trump 2000?
#TUNDRA EGG!
My republican candidate for the state legislature (he lost unfortunately) drives a Prius.
You have [This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/59tf3g/limited_edition_bumper_sticker/) driving a full wrap of the Donald in California.
I don't know about you guys but I kinda want the Prius Prime:

 - 15 minutes to charge to 88%

 - 133 range per charge or 36 MPG

 - bigger than the normal Prius 
 
 - much faster charging and reasonable than the Model S which is pretty shitty since you need to wait 2 hours at a charging station

 - Toyota so it will be running years from now instead of on the side of the road on fire or on trial for killing its owner
If I drove a Prius, I would stick Trump stickers all over it without fear as well.
I was so happy to find 1 car in my area with a sticker...I USED to have one on my car until all the tolerant liberals started rioting..and pulling people out of their cars..I WAS SO MAD to take my sticker down..it felt so wrong to have to hide it..I don't want to live in fear but I also don't want my car to get keyed..and I'm also a female that doesn't want to get their ass kicked in the middle of the night since I have late classes..
Where I'm at there are a ton of old people, FL SURPRISE!, and a bunch own Prius's, and a bunch have Trump stickers on them. Enough where I don't even take a second look. 
A few years ago I worked for a republican state congressman candidate in MA who had a Prius and a Highlander Hybrid. He had stickers on both of them saying "even republicans sometimes drive hybrids." I haven't kept in touch with him since, but I'm sure he voted Trump. 
trump supporter....driving a prius...heads might have exploded there
This isn't as rare as you think. A lot of engineers drive priuses because they like the engineering that goes into them. And a lot of engineers vote Trump because we are trained to solve problems. So I know 3 or 4 people just from my group at work that voted Trump and drive a Prius.
I have one too LOL. Same color. Sold my 392 Challenger to start my business :( I will replace it soon with a new Hellcat or ZL1
I worked with a guy over the summer with a Prius with NRA stickers. Really got my noggin joggin'
Hey

... one of my cars is a hybrid too.  Granted it is an American made hybrid but still!

The Saturn plant it came from no longer makes cars.  Sad.
Majestic 
My family owns a prius and is pretty environmentally conscious and voted trump too

always considered it kinda odd/funny they don't buy into global warming all things considered! i'm as skeptical of it as i am just about everything else.
Bernie bro who can not support someone WHO GETS CHUCKED IN A VAN LIKE A SIDE OF BEEF.
I was told I was a rolling contradiction when I had my Trump sticker on my VW GTI. "That's a damn commie liberal car, they said" hehe. It is, but damn I love it. I'll give it to them, the commies make some good cars and some good guns too.
Simply a sign that you can't ignore smart forever. Trump will end with an 80% approval rating.
They see only the prius when he is coming.

They see the Trump stickers after he has come.
My sort-of boss is a successful CPA and presumably more right-leaning politically. She and her husband bought it as a 2nd (or 3rd maybe) family car and took advantage of the several tax credits our state gives to somebody that buys/owns "green" cars. And using it mostly for weekly commute to and from work, of course she saves a lot on gas, even with the lower than usual gas prices of late. It's not just the hippie-dippy set that fancy the Prius, people that can be trusted to balance a budget see something in them, too.
Only problem with my Harley... no room for a Trumper sticker
Donald Trump is the greatest man to have ever cucked me
Looks like a centipede to me
Another cuck has been trolled

Nothing to see here
Some people actually drive a prius for the gas mileage, not a political statement or tree hugging effort. They're very respectable cars for mpg
Deplorables like high MPG too.......

I drive a Chevy Sonic but my Trump stickers are on my 4x4 Tahoe.
I'm buying a Prius next year and will be putting a Trump sticker on it! :D
Check out my electric car - https://i.redd.it/b7fv7rqz9bwx.jpg
My wife drives a Prius and I drive a Volt. We both proudly voted for Trump. Just because we want to save gas doesn't mean we don't want to MAGA.
Aesthetically, that's not a very pretty car.

But it has a spacious boot, so it's perfect if you go for road trips, or kidnap children.

Toyotas are also fairly reliable and have a good gas mileage. The Japs are meticulous and fussy about quality. Although outsourcing of manufacturing in recent times might have changed that.
My parents both own a prius and voted for trump
I just bought a mustang bullitt, and I'm sorry but this one isn't getting any MAGA stickers üòû my mom's Jeep Compass got "tolerant"ed
Wheeeee! I drive a Kia Optima Hybrid! I'm a unicorn!
I drive a Chevy Volt but I'm a cheap ass Dutchman lol.
I drive a Prius. I have a Clinton for prison sticker on mine. Lol
huh
I have a Prius.

reliable car, good fuel consumption.

its a nippy little thing too.
FUCK YES.
I guess I'm a unicorn because I rocked a trump sticker on my little car. 
A rare sighting indeed. Unbelievable. 
Proud toyota owner, they're good cars. üëåüëÄ
some people just like saving gas :-)
GRAB'EM RIGHT BY THE PRIUS!
I have that same bumper sticker and I go to the University of Minnesota. Have had the sticker for 3 weeks, no vandalism yet but I've gotten flipped off
Based ladies and their lady cars are welcome!
Now that's one Prius that I would **NOT** cut-off!
Holy shit....
Nothing wrong with a used prius. Solid budget minded decision. I think the prices are inflated on the new ones, tho- even more than other Toyotas.
I own a Prius but as a college student I don't want my car vandalized so no stickers but I still rock the MAGA Hat 
One of the bernouts got redpilled 
Subi outback master race reporting. 45 truly is the lion king
Probably Spez's car.
Haha yes. My mother has a Prius. I told her she needs a trump sticker so ppl don't thing she's a libtard. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JUWSLlz0Fdo&t=290s
Conservative...on gas.
I just bought a hybrid. Not because I want to be green or anything, but it was a good deal for a winter beater. 
Welcome to globalism, where Toyotas are more American that Fords nowadays. 
Is it coal powered?
My brother voted Trump and, for some reason that I still cannot fathom, owns a Prius.
BASED GREEN PARTY???
Was this in northern Virginia because (checks Gab) I might have seen this same car on the 16th
Most people I know who go on and on about global warming actually drive huge SUVs and drive to work even though the cities around here can be reached by metro north trains.
Lol, out of the loop here centipedes. Eli5 plz :)
I'd prefer American, but nothing wrong with reducing gas consumption to save some money. 
Ha, I saw two yesterday in SoCal. Gave a friendly honk.
Voted Trump and I've been in the alternative energy business for a while now. There are dozens of us. Dozens!
" it's too bad she won't live, but then again who does?" 
fuck the greens, i just like the miles per gallon fam.
I saw one in Maine the other day!
 I see cars with Trump stickers everywhere in Dallas. 
I pray to Kek that his car doesn't get keyed.
I say right on to them. I have a Jeep and I will never get rid of it, but I have seriously considered a Prius just from an economic standpoint. 
Who knew high fuel mileage could coincide with high energy?
I live in Asheville, drive a Prius, and I voted Trump. Lol. 
(In my defense - I'm really embarrassed driving it especially because of where I live). It felt awesome to drive it with a "Women for Trump" sign in the windshield.
I have a Prius also, but I'm also an Uber driver so I can't put Trump stickers on my car else all the cucks will give me bad ratings :(
Unpopular opinion: I think the Prius is a pretty nice car, at least the one my grandma had was.
It's a platinum unicorn if it was spotted in New York or CA. 
It's intact, though? Seriously, what state was this?
how many scratches were on his car?
That was a window into an alternate reality. That does not exist on our planet. That is antimatter generating stuff there.
When I get a Tesla It'll have a Trump sticker on it.
A unicorn because those stickers haven't been scraped or keyed off, right? That's gotta be it.
This exists?! I've only seen Bernie and fucking Hillary bumper stickers on Prius's before
There's dozens of us! Dozens!
get this driver a coat!
As a subaru owner I know this man's pain. I should be a Bernie or Johnson voter based on my vehicle until you realize its a 5spd manual. High energy gear shifts all day erry day!
Was this in Ohio? I saw one like this.
Ask people in Texas what they think about Toyota.  'Nuff Said.  They are a great company who supports American workers.
Was this in Texas? I swear to kek I saw this same Prius and those same stickers today. The odds are just too slim that we would both see this same unicorn in different states.
Making Prius great a..... never mind.
Why would someone who drives a Prius, vote for someone who denounces climate change?

Liberals in 4 years: the economic prosperity we've had the last 4 years actually started months before trump was in office.  Carrier kept their jobs in America while Obama was president.  Really the reason we're great again is because Obama and Le drumpf is stupid meanie 
HVAC service tech here, this impacts my trade and our ability to sell equipment to companies. I sent the original article on thanksgiving to my dear friend and coworker who absolutely hates trump, like he spends as much time on enoughtrumpspam as I spend on the_donald, he said "I would honestly be impressed and humbled", I was EXTREMELY exited to share this link, waiting for a response, and will hopefully push him to the winning (twice now) team.

Im so used to government operating at a slow crawl.  I truly do wonder how much of a trickle down effect his work ethic is going to have to all arms of the government.

Like...can you imagine getting in and out of the post office in a few minutes??

Just think if THIS was the last 8 years in the white house. The Dow would be at 30,000 by now, a 0% unemployment rate, and there wouldn't be a single major problem within our own borders. At least we are finally on the right track. 

I'm from Indiana.  For the last years 10 I lived and went to school in Chicago.  The Urban Jungle.  And when I'd make periodic trips back to my hometown of 17,000, it was always a story of another factory closing down and a few hundred jobs with it.  Year after year since I started college around 2006.  

While Mike Pence has done a great job revitalizing Indiana's economy (running a $2B surplus), I was taken aback when I saw this story broke.  This is the kind of shit this country has needed for a long time.  Someone to fight for everyone, regardless of the amount of people effected. 

#MAGA!

spez: context
Lmao Libtards actually think this is a bad thing, brainwashed losers kek. Let's not forget the **MADMAN** hasn't even been sworn into office! WHAT WAS OBUMMER DOING THESE PAST 8 YEARS? How can a president be so inept, we should have impeached Obummer long ago.
/r/edacted is saying "he only saved 1000 jobs? that's pathetic."

I stand by my comment if he funded the cure for cancer, the left would immediately call anyone suffering from cancer a racist, and anyone who suffered from it in the past a traitor.

This is awesome news, but to be frank, this whole "God Emperor," "bend the knee" stuff is going to start putting otherwise potentially based individuals completely off if it sticks around as a meme. We all understand that it's tongue-in-cheek here, but folks who have only ever been liberal are not going to see that slight sarcasm.
# WILL WE EVER GET TIRED OF WINNING?!
Does he do this shit in his spare time?

He's still vetting his cabinet and taking calls from world leaders at this point.
I'm so tired of winning (I'm not)
Is this the equivalent of Reagan making a deal to free the American Hostages from Iran before he took office while Carter just stood there cucking around like Obama is?

People are horrible but, I still believe American can get through this horrible spot we are in. Stay together American ! Be Great Again for EVERY ONE!
are people here unaware that the hat is shopped?
its photoshopped but she still hot
Americas founders: We will do everything our power to make sure this is a place with the freedom for democracy to flourish, to change the bad and let the good prevail

2016: kek, love shit or leave shit


DAMN
How much did they have to pay the model?
I would let her make me a cuck with The Donald
Come to the right! Our women are hot!
If you love it, you'll probably leave something.
If I see a girl with a Trump hat and cheeky cut offs that looks like that, I'm grabbing her by the pussy. 
DDDDDDDAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYUUUUUM!!!
Aren't you not supposed to hang flags other than the normal stars and stripes? 
Oh yea, nice computer.
lol photoshopped as fuck
Love it or change it* America is the land of opportunity and if you don't like it don't leave it change it!
'merica!
We have the best women, liberals are just jealous & thats why they are downvoting.

Dude this is so 70's Brazil... Literally a translation of the dictatorship slogan we've had
I shit you not, I think I lived in that house when I was in college.  If she went to Miami University, I'll flip out.  Pretty solid bet based on her political leanings and its known for its extremely hot women 
We have the best bootys. Don't we folks?
So if cucks get triggered by hotties what do they approve of? Is it fat chicks with glasses? 
Yeah. I'd buy that for a dollar. 
is that a tampon string i see ?
Do none of you realize this is shopped?
The stripes on that flag are triggering me right now.
Why is it that the most beautiful smart women are conservatives and on the trump train. Rhetorical question because they're smart. I'll never get tired of winning
Extra crispy
I feel like with Cuba's leader Sadam Usane out of the picture lots of the guidence from Mr Trump will primarily be directed or so more over that bitch hillary. To take away from the presidency and the down fall of the elite political correct librals. Say what you want about republicans but we have the best women around.

Thin girl, thin computer. 
WOW! This is a hot machine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yeah she's hot and all...but...she's still 3D
Yowza! üòã
I love it but I suppose that won't help me nail that ass, sadly
We have the best T&A folks
The election has been over for 3 weeks and this subreddit is still getting thousands of new subscribers every day.

Pretty neat.
You can love a country but hate the government. It's important not to confuse the two.
Specs on PC plz
#IF YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA, THEN YOU CAN GIIIIIIIIIIIITTTT OUT!
#**Why does that flag not have thirteen stripes???**
She has FOR SURE kissed her cousin.
What's going on with the strangely hostile, pedantic, or accusatory comments?  Is r/t_D being infiltrated with dummy accounts?
This is officially the longest I've ever stayed with a thread about gender. THIS right here is exactly what ignorant people need to see about Trump supporters. - that intelligent, reasonable people can have a convo about any hot topic without devolving into complete stupidity and dismissive talking points. 
liberals can never get women like this. probably why they're so angry.
Fuck off with these attention whores 
How about we use the real fucking flag next time you faggots. How are we going to MAGA without our actual flag? The flag is a sacred thing and you fuck heads thinking this makeshift flag is ok needs their anus checked. 
#Love it or leave it! üá∫üá∏
America is great every were I go, I can feel the energy. And I would tear that ass up
God I wish I had money
Where can I get this flag?
This looks to be a under aged girl. We got proof she is an adult? Just don't want us spreading an image of a teenager around, may get us banned.
She puts the "Trump" in "I Want Front Row Seats To Her Sweet Butt Trumpet Symphony" 
Beautiful. How do we know these are not CTR shills attempting a distraction? Seriously.
Epic
I NEED THIS FLAG
Only see one. Feel kinda jipped
Love me some Whiskey Tango
What computer case is that?

[ X ] Would
This is the worst. 
Sorry but after pizzagate I can't look at this because she looks to be about 13. 
Her brother took this pic I bet
Good luck getting an abortion. You'll be stuck with that dumb fucker's kid forever.
I've seen a lot of hot trump babes, but I think this one is underage.
Can I love it and beat it ?.. ;)
I love her long time, America.
I don't think she's a legal centipede but I upvoted her anyway. 
photoshopped hat and ugly girl :o
# fuck Saul Alinsky 
Turns out race baiters happens to be the most heinous racists themselves. They accuse and project racism in others because they assume everybody else acts like themselves.
But...but.... acceptance! 


BTFO Cucks
Fwiw as recently as last year I've had classes (taught by white libs) literally drilling into our heads that "a black person will never reach the same heights as a white person". At first everyone was like, lol wtf, but by the end everyone was like, yeah i guess. Half of the class was that, and the other half was getting every white student to apologize to the class for having white privilege.

Class was fucked up. I'm the only one who held out. And ofc not white, so people were like, why defend whitey lol. I'm like, cause it doesn't make any sense.
Sleep tight, Tucker
Watch his documentary Hillary's America. Very illuminating
Also should watch Hillarys America.
[deleted]
The Democrats and the far left want minorities to be their helpless obedient pets, and not be independent autonomous beings who are capable of self suffiency and success.
My favorite video was my introduction to Dinesh. This scares liberals to the core which is why they demonize him. They can't win a debate with this man


https://youtu.be/VREa-8-UK3A

His minority card is now revoked.
Thank you for stickying this! I watched this a few hours ago and it is the most important speech I have seen in a long time. Dinesh filled in a lot of gaps I had in my understanding history of the Democratic Party and the US. 

**MUST WATCH** 
Dinesh for the fucking win!
Racism isn't just discrimination. At its core is using identity politics to polarize. That's why when America was basically white we made everyone give up their home country values in public discourse for the most part. Common language etc...What we are seeing now will never work. It can't.
identity politics is cancer
The reason I woke up about this particular election, is this man. Thank you Dinesh. 

I bought in to the hype at first about Trump being this horrible person. Then I found out what Hillary has done, and realized Donald really is just trying to help us. Such a champ.
It takes a lot of courage and humility to admit when you're wrong especially in a public forum and especially when it goes against the liberal narrative. This dude has my respect.  
My boy Indian mr bean speaking the truth 
#BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST!
Is that the guy from Rules of Engagement ?  
D'Souza dated Ann Coulter. 

I bet he tore it up.
#CANT CONFUSE THE D'SOUZ
Starting from 33mins is the real important part about the "Big Switch". We need to redpill the American public using memes about that!
democrats should watch this, not centipedes. sad
Dems r real racist
He speaks so much truth they arrested him. 
He forgot sexist. I mean prior to this election cycle, there was no "are women funny?" bullshit.

It was obvious, some were, some weren't. 

It's obvious someone behind the scenes instigated the entire Ghostbusters and Amy Schumer scam, someone smart enough and rich enough to plant this bullshit into popular culture, knowing these people had little to no talent. It's literally brilliant and insidious.
Watching this right now. Holy hellfire o_O
The top comment on youtube is asking if anyone knows how many "walnut" people Hillary exported on her plane. We are winning so bigly. 
I'm about half way through this video.  This is damned fantastic.  This man is amazing.
#BASED DINESH STRIKES AGAIN ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
This guy has more balls and brains than every democrat and republican since Reagan.


Wow. Another Dinsesh power session. 

This guy does NOT take advantage of his allegiance to this great Republic. 
I am watching this and the look on the faces in the crowd... is priceless. 

You see the (even though they are conservative's) faces in the crowd
thinking... wait this isn't what they taught me.

Hope he woke up some of them. smh! 
Ann Coulter is much better at it.
Everyone should watch this.  Thank you!
Incredible.

Edit: I'm literally woke as fuck right now.
He makes a great point. The less racist the south became, the more republican it became

Of course the typical leftist response is "well why are racists all republicans now?"

Well that's because of liberal movies, media, and education telling racist people that's the party they belong to. 
Leftist ideology:

DR^3 is for fags. Let them continue to wear out the word "racist".

It's funny hov the left pehaffes exactly the zame in both Germany and Sveten ven it comes to zeir racism. "Tolerant left" indeed.

#1800-USA-1776
Too bad dsouza is a douche
Holy shit, Dinesh is a convicted felon - THUG LIFE.
Hillarys America was a great documentary considering the budget, I liked how he went back to early America for more perspective on racism in the Democratic party. As soon as the civil rights act was achieved, the black ghetto and welfare state was ushered in for their votes. 
What a beast. I can't believe I watched the whole thing but it was worth. 
Popular opinion wants you to believe that Carter was the worst POTUS because he was ineffective. <leans into mic> Wrong! It has always been FDR, because he was effective in propelling America away from the foundation that made it great. The New Deal was the worst bit of policy ever presented to the American people. Bernie sanders ain‚Äôt got nothing on that crap.
Smartest dude out there. Wish this guy would run for congress.
Epic, worthy of mic drop.
I watched the whole thing and loved it thank you for sharing. 
What's the hashtag for pardoning Dinesh?   #pardondinesh

He's president-elect and he's doing more than the actual president.
Looking forward to more details.
Holy shit. HES NOT EVEN FUCKING PRESIDENT YET!
Posted London Time. Odd.

Trump is a Machine. Tired of winning yet?
Obama BTFO

Not even President yet and Trump has done much more this year than Barack 
Liberals crying about tax incentives

Somebody needs to sit them down and talk about simple Economics 

NYT reported it was 2k jobs http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/trump-to-announce-carrier-plant-will-keep-jobs-in-us.html?_r=0
**ThatsMyPresident**
This sounds like the same plant that was seen announcing [the move on youtube](http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/12/news/companies/carrier-moving-jobs-mexico-youtube/) and I wouldn't put it past CNBC calling 1,400 jobs "close to" 1,000 jobs. Can't find any conformation at the moment though.
Funny, Trump has kept more American jobs in this country than Obama has and hes not even president yet. Let me check CNN quick tho, i think he said something mean in 1983
That is our man at work right there.

Already more jobs than Obama
Wow. Not even President yet and he has done more for Jobs in this Country than Obama did in 8 wasted years
Let's play, pick the liberal response! 

1. Somehow Trump is profiting from this
2. 1000 people isn't that many
3. He isn't President yet, he's over-stepping his boundaries
4. This isn't true
5. How much is this costing our government?

Use this handy checklist and if you can find all 5 of these common liberal responses, you win a brand new coat!
Not even president yet! Wow 
#A^R^T O^F T^H^E D^E^A^L
Trump has done more than Obama. 8 years of shit & golf vs 3 weeks of winning.
**CNN BREAKING: TRUMP IMPRISONS CARRIER PERSONNEL; BREAKS 20-YEAR EXTRADITION TREATY WITH MEXICO**
a president truly works for the people
Obama would have given them a tax break
He's not even president yet! 
Amazing.  Such accomplishments thus far.   
It's really happening.

God bless the God Emperor! No brakes!
Question, how was he able to do this before becoming the president?
I'm just sitting here with grin on my face remembering all those speeches were he said "we can bring those jobs back, **and it will be EASY, and happen so fast, big league fast, believe me!**"  

And ALL the MSM pundits made fun of him. Easy? Oh come on, how the hell can he do that. Pffffffftttttt... 

I bet there are a lot of people in Indiana right now with the same grin on their face, and goddammit I'm happy for them.

... and the man isn't even President yet, but he's already getting the job done. 


https://twitter.com/Carrier/status/803764047300722688 Tweet from Carrier, just WOW, so happy for those people and all of us in this country!
WOOT
 #NotTiredOfWinning
LEADERSHIP, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
**HE'S NOT EVEN SWORN IN YET. MY GOD THIS IS GOING TO BE A GLORIOUS 8 YEARS**
I think we need to start a petition to dock Obamas pay, i mean what the fuck is he even doing right now? Trump is literally doing his job for him, better, faster, and for 1/400,000th of the cost.
CNN: Trump destroying American jobs
BIG LEAGUE STUFF
I'm sleepy...no...wait....NEVER!!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
...can you imagine being one of those 1,000? 
Thanks Obama!
#He did it! He called Carrier! 


Best part? The winning ain't started yet. This is just a sniff of those tasty ass win cookies baking.
Mr. President...I can't...I can't do it anymore.  Please, its too much.  I can't handle all this winning.  Its to much to fast!
Holy shit and he's not even President yet. MAGA!!!
should make for an interesting day of work tomorrow I work in the Engineering building that was going to stay next door to the plant.
Can't stop! Won't stop! Don't even know how to stop winning!
Where did all of these comcern trolls come from holy shit.
I wonder how many liberals are thinking, holy fuck this guy might actually be on to something
This is what I like to see. :)
Already done more than Obama and he isn't even president yet. MAGA
So much wall. Many high. Very MAGA!
And he isn't even the President yet. He's done more not being the President in weeks than Obama has done BEING the President for 8 years. Wow!
(*Dying Breath*) Too.... much.... winning....  
It'd be nice to know what exact "rules" he thinks we're breaking
also:

 308,200 readers

16,176 users here now
He thinks we are breaking rules by using bots to upvote.  All the moderators and users outside this Dom_reddit think we cheat upvotes.  They can't imagine such a click happy group really exists.  Or they say we are hive minded and blindly upvote everything.  I do upvote a lot, but not everything.
What fucking rules are we even breaking!?
its just so typical of the left. when you have to cheat to win...you may be on the wrong side
[removed]
And there we go, this is why I am no longer on the left, they claim to be a victim and lie about others so they can justify their actual evil. 

Censorship and hate for those that have a different opinion, dirty tricks and manipulation. 

Thanks for exposing this, it's the behavior of those that lost the argument. 
[removed]
Send this to the news sites. 
What rules do we break again?
I know this has been said over and over but it's **TOPKEK** that they're so obsessed with us.     
they have always had downvote bots


If you have to cheat to feel normal..  You might be a fucked up individual.
Why do you hide his name?

That user should be reported for breaking site rules.
If you have the originals with names on them, PLEASE forward this to the mods if you haven't already.  NOT admins...MODS for this sub.  Thank you!
How sad is it that these low energy libs have to resort to botting.
This pic is from a different users post.
https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5fle53/script_that_automatically_downvotes_and_hides_all/
**THEY CAN'T STUMP THE TRUMP TRAIN**
This is a huge problem.. If you search the greasemonkey script archives for The_donald the only thing you find are scripts to punish /r/the_donald or it's users. The left are all crybaby assholes
Very petty.  Not worth the worry.  Remember, Reddit already screws with T_D karma.  It's not like a few washed up cucks are going to harm anything.  Shitposts will counteract these fools.     
just imagining all these cucks trying to figure out what the script even does is making me laugh. reupload new version to greasyfork and openuser that does the same to politics and they would have no idea
I see this all the time on ETS.
No big deal, we'll just have to outvote the combination of libs & their automated vote-generating machines... not too unfamiliar of an obstacle, if I recall.
Isn't this the sort of thing that could screw Reddit over in general if the admins don't work hard to squash it?

I'm sure if low energy libtards can make something like this, high energy nimble navigators could trump it with something far better as a counter and also as a retaliation?

This could be nasty war. We beat them every time, this would be no exception.
Que the we got some lawbreakers over here by Matthew McCoughney!
There are several scripts on greasemonkey for that... but changing down to up kinda fixes them lol
Why spend some much of your time spreading your misery?
Nothing they do anymore matters we already won the election. They can delete t_d and ban the word "Trump" from all of reddit for all I care, they lost. LOL
Good luck getting cuck u/spez to enforce HIS OWN rules on this one
100% serious. What rules are we breaking? If there's any Hillary supporters/liberals who see this comment, please feel free to PM me if you're afraid that you'll be downvoted. I promise I won't flame, doxx, or harass you.
Our energy will overcome

spez: Can we write a script of our own that upvotes posts automatically? 
They **BASELESSLY** assume we bit when its simply not true, and they admit to doing it.
Hate we can't call out people. This basically means we see this person is going to fuck us and we can't do anything. The hell?
"It even bypasses the CSS"  
What a noob, just press "a" for upvote and "z" for downvote.

you're forced to subscribe when you visit this sub? ive only used it on mobile, and never experienced anything. is this true?
#BEEP BOOP 
as a bot i would be offended by their abuse of my kind if i could feel emotion
#BEEP 
Someone get the script from him and modify it to do the same to them
Let the cucks run their downvote scripts, it will only upset them more when we're STILL 80% of r/all 
lmao. cant stump trump mother fucker
Our broken rules = telling the truth and other things that don't agree with them.

Their broken rules = total censorship by trying to take away our voices.

How in the world does that work out?

"It's OK to kill people because they J-walked". 
Hopefully the reddit admins were messaged.  Just from that comment they would delete his account instantly along with every other account  associated with it.  
I don't understand... we are over here in our corner not bothering or harassing anyone. If they don't like what we post they are welcome to not visit here. Why the hell is it everyone's priority to find a way to shut us down?? Complete bullshit...
Yay! The corrupted minds are forced to use corrupted tactics because they know no truth.
What is TD doing to break the rules exactly ? 
dude, dont censor the names out! people like this need to be presented to Reddit, and at the same time threaten to go public with the proof if Reddit doesn't terminate these accounts and whatever it can to keep these cucks off Reddit for good. This is clear violation of Reddit rules!
Pizza?
Treason?
MSM?



Is this what is halting us from maximizing meme production!!??
HA!
They'll still check this sub out
So...it's a bot...which I believe is in violation of the ToS, no?
Things like this make you realize you're on the right side.

We can write scripts too. We don't. We don't need to.


It would be hilarious if this was someone playing 4D chess and actually gave them a script that upvoted all of the posts...
This makes me sick 
Huh this is probably why when you submit something on this subreddit it gets down votes before pedes are able to up vote it.
These people want to control our government and they can't even play by these simple rules? BTFO.
Whatever sub that is should be shut down. Spez is a complete fucking hypocrite. What a piece of shit....
Script kiddies... little babies..
Let them use their literal cheap libtard tactics, we still WON!  At the end of the day they can downvote all they want but we still have our God Emperor. 
#**CUCK ALERT, CUCK ALERT**
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
"Bypassing the css" omg what a hackzor... doing something that requires no extra work. 

This guy's a cunt, vice manipulation us stupid, silencing free speech is also stupid. 
This has to be from r/[redacted] right?
Low energy. 3/10 for trying.
>Who cares what the fuckin reddiquete and ethics people say, we need to win this motherfucker!
These people literally cannot handle an opposing viewpoint being anywhere in their vicinity. Ridiculous.
lol PATHETIC
Well now, this use of Tampermonkey appears to be... illicit.

https://tampermonkey.net

**¬øWOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY A GAME?**


It's not a problem. No one cares about the internet points. We just won the president, let them have points.
I upvote all t_d posts I see for this reason. MAGA
Shutting this sub down would be a huge PR mistake, even bigger then fat people hate, it would cripple what is left of the site's rep and change it from a site to openly discuss things to tumblr 2.0 (Libtards and SJWs circle jerking each other).
Lol that will get a user perma banned from Reddit.
"I'm not interested in getting doxed, harassed, or threatened"

I guess that's why you're a liberal then since they're the only ones who do that around here.
I hope you reported that account. I wouldn't have blocked the name, that way everyone here could report him, though I'm sure we'd be accused of harassment.
They think we hacked Plebbits algorithm but in reality we're just 

#BASED!
Ignorant and unreasonable loudmouths caused the dems to lose the white house,  the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Supreme Court,  the most governors, and state reps to the Republicans. Please stay stupid, dems...please. 
#It's not like any of these children will buy an A/C. Mom and dad will buy it when the old unit dies and the basement becomes too hot. 
This "RACIST" probably just helped a lot of poor minorities and whites keep their jobs! How *dare* he! (only liberals can criticize something universally positive)
Leftists are angry because they're stupid. It's not their fault.
I hope Trump speaks out in support of oxygen and water next. It'll be fun watching these retards compete to see who can asphyxiate/dehydrate better.
#MY NEXT A/C WILL BE A CARRIER BECAUSE GLOBALASTS CAN GO SUCK A BIG FAT ONE!
I'm not saying this as a Trump supporter, just an ac guy.   Trane can suck my balls with their overly complicated bullshit 
The party of love, inclusiveness and tolerance showing their ass yet again.  Their behavior reassures me again and again that I'm on the right side of the argument.  

Yeah jobs!!
CNN: Trump steals jobs from poor Hispanics and gives it to *gasp* Americans 
The answer to the question "can people really be that stupid?" is ALWAYS "yes."
How the fuck do babies grow that size? and when do they have the motor functions to type words on a screen?
Wow, leftists would rather people lose their livelihood if it means companies don't negotiate with the POTUS. 

Fucking disgusting people. 
#LibTard BTFO in two words:

**How so?**
They're pissed Trump saved the jobs of the very people the left claims to protect and care about. This is why they are falling apart, their true colors are showing now that they are losing control. 
Lmao. These people are such ideologues. They don't even know why their angry. ANGER FOR THE SAKE OF ANGER. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO KEEP THEIR JOBS AND I'D BE PRAISING THIS IF HILLARY NEGOTIATED IT BUT BECAUSE TRUMP NEGOTIATED IT, IT MUST BE MISOGYNY! 

I sincerely hope that all of these people will fucking move to Canada. They can bring Trudeau into their safe space and give him all the blowjobs their heart desires. You know, until they realize their mistake and self-cut and mutilate themselves due to their never-ending victim complex. Modern liberalism really is a fucking mental disorder.
Please spread this around. This is the kind of stuff that is driving those in the middle or slightly left way into red pill status. 
Since 2009 more Americans have been laid off due to outsourcing and more Americans have purchased firearms than have ever done since the 1930s-1950s

Dems want to run on a program of globalism and anti-second amendment and can't figure out why they got their asses handed to em

Must have been that cartoon frog!
Pathetic
Who are they kidding these liberal idiots don't own houses. Gotta virtue signal at every moment possible.
My furnace and AC will be due to be replaced in the next 2-3 years. If this keeps true, I will specifically ask for a carrier system, regardless of cost.
We like trains here also. Ones with No Brakes!
Its okay. The other 50% will help make up the market share. Soon enough buying american made products will become feasible again. The rest will follow. 
lol
Now Trump is a terrorist!  HOLY SHIT MY SIDES.  KEKEKEKEK
Fuck by March next year they'll be refusing to have kids, and we'll all finally agree on something!
These kinds of responses actually do tremendous good in terms of moving the reasonable people out of the DNC.  
#TWO BENT KNEES
These people are dumb and should be ignored.
Creating thousands of jobs before he is even in office? Guess what's not being covered by the media...
Given the opportunity it appears these two clowns would gladly offer up 1000 other people's jobs up to the altar of their narrative.  Sick!
"True American companies don't do business in America!"
#Trump could cure cancer and leftists would say he's putting nurses out of jobs. They just keep showing how dumb they are and I'm ok with that.
Twitter and Facebook the places where sjw's go to huff and puff while the rest of us get shit done in the real world.
Let them keep it up, it'll gurantee us winning for generations. 
Obama's useful idiots sabataging the left further. 
is he talking about Bill Clinton? 
Terrorist he says!!! Hahahahhahahhaaa.  Oh man he is a grade A idiot. 
Of course, these people have never worked a job in their life. And by job, I don't mean government or academia.
It's so fucking hard to try and comprehend how these people think. Or DON'T think, more to the point.
He'd rather have 1000 people lose their jobs than someone work with Trump.

Just sit there and think about how fucked up his priorities are.
Trane is a better product, but more expensive. And i doubt carrier will miss a few stupid liberals purchasing their residential equipment. 
I thought you guys were exaggerating about the misogynistic plantologist cis xenophoic scum bigot trigot stuff. They really just slap those labels on anything they don't like huh?
Lol "true American companies don't negotiate with..." The motherfucking president of the motherfucking U S of motherfucking A bitch and don't you forget it.
There is no depth these people won't sink to. They can't even be happy for the people who will get to keep their jobs.
Jesus H Christ.  Truly sick People.
Hopefully the liberals will realize that the majority of the food they consume is made in the good ol' US of A and they should boycott that too.
What is wrong with these people?
is the left ever happy or are they just joyless negative nellies? 
If it makes them feel any better; ill be buying carrier for the new duplexes.
I think they are just **tired of winning**.  /s

Seriously, in your own echo chamber of smugness, the other guy is ALWAYS wrong. Logic be dammed. I've seen it before, it's what happens when you don't think for yourself and blindly follow an ideology.  
>misogynistic xenophobic trolls / terrorists



That's interesting to see. They dragged "racist, sexist" and a few other buzzwords through the dirt so much that the words are meaningless now so they don't even use them themselves anymore. 


Calling a democratically elected president terrorists... that's all kinds of stupid. Its actually not even possible to even try to understand how "terrorist" got attached to Trump here. 
Whoa, 1,000 jobs.... now that's foresight.
Well, Robert's twitter accounts days will be numbered.
#DEGENERATE LEFT
Unfortunately, there are not enough liberals for their boycott to do any damage.
http://i.imgur.com/YzBYqNN.gif
So sad - Would rather let Americans lose their jobs than give Trump credit.
Oh my god .. he's calling people terrorist .?? Did he see what happened at my beloved buckeye campus yesterday? 
I worked in a building that used 10/15/25 ton Carrier and Trane HVAC units. I can say unequivocally that the Carrier units broke down less, with easier fixes and cheaper parts than the Trane units.
Robert Dillon is a bitch of a man. Lib freak fest 2016 is glorious.
Commenter douche doesn't realize that the tens of millions of Americans will now make Carrier their No. 1 choice.
Well I'll buy a Carrier should I need an AC. 
Keeping jobs in America is now not a "true American" thing to do. The mental gymnastics of the liberal mind. Looks like the only gymnastics porky is capable of too.

In other news he is in an absolute meltdown on twitter. It's pretty funny.
Trump is a "terrorist" now? I've heard it all LMAO!
The mental gymnastics with these people.  Liberalism = mental illness.
Leftist ideology:

[ _ ] Sane

[ X ] Insane
If its made in America I'll buy it.
Marxism doesn't like the competition.
I wonder if they have any energy efficient units with solar energy in mind. Now I have to take a look. Thanks Carrier!
DOUBLE DOWN DEMS TRIPLE DOWN I CAN ONLY GET ~~SO~~ HARDER AT YOUR FAILURE
Proof that you can't fix stupid.
To be fair, Trane IS better imo, but Robert Dillon can go choke on a dick.

Signed, Lefty Lefterson.
True American companies will actually not voice their opinion on any sort of political party and will actually just do business with all legal buyers.

A company is just a company and it should not have any sort of legal affiliation. The owners can have their own personal views, but you better leave those the hell out of the picture because we're here to do business in t he *open* market. In this market trading is done with money, and not fee-fee's and hugs. 
Speaking of Trane, isnt that what that group of men ran on our wife last night as you watched in the corner?
"*Stupid orange racist saving jobs for bigoted sexist racist xenophobic redneck homophobes. Fuck air conditioners! I refuse to use indoor climate control when they are repaired by bigots. #Lovetrumpshate #BoycottIndoorClimateControl4Love #DieofHeatstrokeAgainstHate*"

*Edit: also Islamophobes*

*Edit: also white supremacists* 
wow what fukn morons
Leftist dont care about results, only motivation. Its a religion. You win by proving you are more devout.
It's not just liberals. Pop on over to the cuckservative sub and see how mad they are about it.
Trane is irrelevant outside America.

The market is mostly Japanese aircon manufacturers.
More radical Leftists showing their true colors.

More committed to their ridiculous ideology than to their own nation.

If something goes against their beliefs, just burn it all down, right? Screw the country.

(Reminds me of the riots we've seen as of late...)
What would have been the right thing to do here?  Move the jobs to spite Trump?  They're willing to put 1,000 *other* people out of work just so they can say "Hah!  Trump didn't save those jobs!".  What a bunch of assholes.
At this point I honestly doubt they know what "misogynist/xenophobic" mean but are just using them because they see everyone else do.
HVAC guy here, Carrier > Trane as far as reliability and being serviceable go. Tranes aren't bad, there are just certain quirks about them that don't allow them to last as long as a Carrier without very stringent maintenance. 

The only thing Trane has over Carrier is Tranes compressors last longer. 
So much wall. Many high. Very MAGA!
what happens if trump brings in millions of jobs. will they boycott all those jobs too? wtf is logic even.
HA! Keep it up leftists, you'll lose all of the working class you so love to pretend to represent at this rate. 
Just ridiculous.
Liberal heads exploding on twitter talking about they don't want government intervention in business. It's like whatever side you take with these people they take the opposite stance even when it's totally fucked. 
It's OK Carrier, these people won't buy a Trane or anything else because Mom's basement is mild all year long.

I'm glad to hear this because I replaced one of my AC's with a Carrier earlier this year and we'll replace our other one next year (big house).
Seriously, everyone talking on CNN right now sound like a bunch of fools saying that saving jobs is somehow bad. CNN is such a joke.
I've always thought these types of people will be food for dinosaurs when they come back. 

Keep it up, liberal left!  
  
The more they post, the more they become completely irrelevant to the political process.  
  
Eventually the entire DNC infrastructure will be at a sufficient size and strength to drown in a truck stop toilet.
Dear God these cucks are fucked. 
carrier is a fucking white male confirmed. 
Fucking idiots.
None of these anti-Patriots will ever be in a position to choose or install their own air conditioner, as that requires real skills of the working class MAGA men and women. These cry babies have no usable skills, as last i checked, "professional crybaby" is not a usable skill outside of the Soros Hiring Agency.
Trying some new CSS for link flairs, tell us if you like 'em. I saw this *very* spicy post and felt inspired.
Go easy on him, guys.

For God's sake, his dad just died.
I could see Trump and Farage in a buddy cop movie.
Is that Castro's kid?
2017 will go down as the year a whole lot of people got BTFO.

#CUCK OLIVER ON SUICIDE WATCH. WILL HE LIVE PAST CURRENT YEAR?
Come on guys. go easy on me. It's not easy being this progressive. I just want to culturally enrich my country. Globalism is totally nothing like Communism. Give it a try. Your friend George Soros supports it, so it can't be that bad.  
Trudeau has zero power. He is a pretty boy puppet. I have no respect for him but I almost feel bad for him. ^*Almost*

Go drink some wheat germ shots and let the big boys get to work. 
T
I'm a simple 'pede. I see Trump and Farage, I upvote. 
Two true patriots.  MAGA gentlemen MAGA
God, I love that picture of Trump and Farage. If you compare it to the staged banter between Obama and Trudeau, Trump and Farage look so genuine. 
i cant help but smile when i see those two together
The western world took the right turn just before getting to the cliff edge.
I love those two. 
I want to see Nigel Farage carrying the bust of **Winston Churchill** back into the White House, the very one that Obozo gave back to the British.
Farage's face might be the best thing imaginable to sum up 2016.
That guy in the back has a sikh hat
As a Canadian if you all could help us win the meme war against Trudeau when it's time we would be forever grateful. 
I'm surprised JT doesn't see the poppy as a symbol of Islamophobic fascist white patriarchal military supremacy steeped in anti-black history.  Canada really needs to get it's shit together 4 years of this guy is going to do a lot of damage. 
This post makes me so immeasurably happy.
redditors bitching about 2016 always... favorite timeline 
#TRIGGER ALERT
Fuck Trudeau

Hey /u/camshaftdaisy,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
2016 has been the best political year of the millennium. Brexit and Trump. However, hope 2017 will prove me wrong! :D
Behold, I lift my thumb beside the golden door. 
Omg friends we Canadians are so embarrassed that this guy represents us....he thinks he is in a play pretending to be the PM. Cuck/idiot o the highest order. 
GLORIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Just a reminder NOT ALL CANADIANS ARE CUCKS. Some of us have been on the Trump Train since DAY ONE! Brexit as well!

Trudeau is a national disaster on every front.
I've been a believer in Trump since the first rally I saw in Mobile, AL in 2015. Nigel, on the other hand, I've been following since 2008 and have been rooting for him ever since. It's a rare thing to hear a voice of reason in the spotlight in Britain.

Here's to hoping for more positive changes in our "special relationship" headed by Trump and Nigel's personal and political bond!
#BEST CURRENT YEAR EVER
Put away the feel-good decorations, it's time to get shit done.

Very Spicy!

Every time I see this picture of The Farage and The Donald I always think about how hilarious that night must have been for both of them.
Because it's 2015 is a terrible reason to hire a woman. She should be hired because she can do the job. And yes, I am a woman. I wouldn't want to be hired simply because I'm female and the boss is trying to be politically correct. 
That Nigel Farage guy always looks so happy to be so uncucked.

As a Cancuckistani this puts a massive smile on my fat face, we can only hope for based Bernier from stopping this outrageously beta communist-apologist scum from occupying my country for just 4 years instead of 8.

Memes so spicy wanna slap yo' mama.
People on FB and media outlets ate up that stupid "because it's 2015" line... not only was it so scripted and he had already said he'd pick a cabinet that was 50/50, but THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PICK YOUR ADVISORS!!! HOLY SHIT! PICK ON MERIT AND QUALITY! If that happens to be 75+% male or female, who cares.
Wowzer
Trudeau for President of Mars Settlment Alpha!!!!

That is the son of Fidel Castro. Can't unsee 
Still a better love story than Harper.

Omg lol.  As a Canadian I love this.   Oh how I hated the because it's 2015 thing
MAGA baby MAGA
His grinder name is CastroLover69
Media: "Trudeau had the best answer for why he chose a gender split cabinet instead of a merit based cabinet!"
Trudeau: "Because it's 2015."
Me: "That wasn't a fucking answer!"
I see a lot of you guys saying JT is castros son- A quick google search shows resemblances, but it's hard to find good comparison pick. Any of you nimble  navigators have a good side by side of the 2 at a similar age?
2015 was peak-social-justice.
Trump Cucked Trudeau just like he cucked me.
2016 could not have happened without all the cuckery of 2015. Thank you cucks.
It would be badass. Farage had already survived a plane crash, Trump bought to bring back serious law and order. Might as well just make it a biography and call it a day
I love that bottom picture.
I can't look at Trudeau anymore without seeing Castro.
\#NotMyPrimeMinister
Why does everyone in the first picture look like they just took a shit? Is that shopped?
$Current_year has been breddy gud so far. $Current_year-1 was peak degeneracy.

When did Castro shave his beard? 
Can't wait for the swing back to Conservatism here in Cuckistan.

Or, a fence in some places
A wall that will do no good, since most illegals come here on airplanes, or in cars, or on boats, legally, and then overstay their visas.     

The border wall is just a big waste of resources (and money, since Mexico won't pay for it) which would be better used elsewhere, for example improving sea walls & levees in places like New Orleans, since rising sea levels (due to global warming) and hurricanes threaten to destroy the city and displace the people living there.  That's a real actual threat, unlike the droves of mythical border-jumpers.      

The wall will solve nothing.      

Edit:  changed mythological to mythical. 
Indeed. And not a wall built by Mexico either. US FUNDED wall would be great! Think of the anti illegal sensors and shit! With third world construction you know they'll leave exploits for the cartel to continue business as usual.
I have a feeling this is going to be a comfy Christmas season.

 'Twas the night before MAGA, when all through the House

Not a senator was stirring, not even a mouse;

The results were hung by the TV with care,

In hopes that St. Trump soon would be there;

forgot to color his ass the right shade of green 0/10 meme 
*How Pepe Saved Christmas*.
NO BRAKES
I wouldn't mind The Grinch who tried to steal the election going to jail either.
I'm just glad that Mr Trump is going to bring Christmas back.  

It was under attack. Don't fucken tell me it wasn't. 
Question: can the border be secured with drones and similar technology? A lot of libtards actually want illegal immigration but they complain about the cost of the wall as a way of opposing it. I wonder if a drone secured border could be as effective and make the libtards actually say what they think: that illegal immigration doesn't bother them.
A "BBW", if you will?
Wow, ME TOO!  Hopefully Santa Trump will bring all our dreams to their fruition.
If it ain't funny to see some dumb ass Oh for fucks sake guy are speaking out against this wall, and you'll find that the supercucked SJW's won't like this...

Rockin' around the Christmas wall, have a happy holiday!

Red flag, guys.


So fucked up. 
I will definitely donate to this patriot if there is a way!
What's the word here guys? Scam or no scam?
Anti-Trump people are the worst people in the world.  They're losers.  They've never hired anyone.  They've never built anything.  They're a bunch of idiots who hate greatness since it makes them insecure.  The only thing they care about is a sense of security in a herd of equally worthless people.
I'm hoping I'm wrong about this.  However the details of the story kind of set off a red flag for me.  No overt pro-trump behavior, home in foreclosure,  no insurance, and suddenly anti-trump graffiti.   As much as my heart wants to believe the family, I need a confirmation first this wasn't self inflicted arson. (Furnishings sitting in storage somewhere, getting back at the bank for foreclosure, blame on anti-trump terrorists that are active right now, and hope to reap some charitty from the communitiy.)   So my rule on giving right now would be support basic needs to help them. Food, shelter and some Christmas gifts for the kids.  Rebuilding house, extra charity over the top from the community... needs to hold off till the fire is investigated first.
No good newz ever in Florida 
"We never made it public. We never had a sign in our backyard, so no one really knew we were pro Trump."

Stabbing in Ohio school, German women beat to a pulp for not giving immigrant kids smokes, and now this crap.


Where are all these attacks from Trump's supporters that the left fear? 

All we've seen is fake swastika stories.



They cover for Muslim terrorists and commit violent acts on people they disagree with.

It's madness that they keep screaming "We're the victims".





##Trust but verify.
#HEY LEFT! ITS CALLED PROJECTING! DID YOUR PSYC MAJOR PROFESSORS NOT TEACH YOU THIS OR DID YOU SKIP THOSE DAYS?
Silly libs! BUILDING NEW WALLS IS WHAT WE DO!!!
I wonder how this story would fare over on /r/[REDACTED]
**GET. THIS MAN. A FUCKING FAMILY WIDE COAT.**
>'Who would do something like this'

I think we all know who would do something like this. 
I'm not sure burning down houses is an effective way to get people back onto your team.
We need to start a go fund me for this patriot!
Fucking disgusting someone would do that. One can argue there are a few rare (And I mean *rare*) exceptions, but being butt-hurt because you lost is far from them.

I used to think liberal/conservative was just a point of view on issues, but over the year I have taken note of the left lying, oppressing, rioting, and vandalizing in addition to illogical thinking and now (Well, awhile back) I know it's not. Leftist beliefs truly are a plague to society.
Start the GoFund me and alert the President - Elect of this terrorism 
Someone who burns another man's house down out of spite doesn't deserve to be a citizen of this great nation. Hell, they don't deserve the gift of life.

But instead of giving into rage, let us centipedes do the honorable thing: rebuild this patriot's home.

Success is the best revenge.
"The Smiths, who have two young children, say times have been hard recently. They say their home is in foreclosure and they have no insurance to cover the belongings that burned. Brittany says it doesn't make sense to her."

hmmm, and now everyone wants to buy them a house...

He would be a madman but maybe not huge risk vs. reward. People tend to come through for stories like this.

^I ^await ^my ^downvotes.
OP, when there's a gofundme set up post it please.
These protesters don't even know it understand why they are even protesting. Mindless zombies running around destroying lives and homes. We are family here at The Donald. One falls we help them up. If someone has a go fund me link,please let me know... I bet if Trump found this out,he would help out because that's the kind of President Elect we have. One who cares for the people...
I'M SO PISSED!!

:(
wtf thats vile.
All these kids making a mess of others people's lives leaving others to clean up after them. Prayers go out to this family.

We got a lot of illegal immigrant tolerant leftists to deport. I cannot wait for a Trump Presidency.
u/the-realDonaldTrump
Trust but verify. Home in foreclosure, no personal debt involved. Personal belongings, not worth much. Charitable giving from sympathetic political pandering, like Jill stein... Lots to gain. 

Smells like dead fish. 
Send this to Trump too!
Stories like this get little national attention, while stories of someone having a backwards swastika drawn on their window with removable marker are the front page. 
Some people are just WAITING for an "excuse" to commit crimes. 
GET THIS MAN A COAT!



GET HIS CHILDREN A COAT!



THERE...I HELPED?
While it's still being investigated, and the graffiti wasn't actually on their property... we should stay tuned. Either way these good people lost their home and we should stay tuned to see how we all can help them out.
How can we donate?
Send this story to trumps team. Seriously. 
If I see a legit GoFundMe then I will throw some $ his way for sure.
**LET'S BUILD THAT HOUSE AND MAKE IT 10 FT TALLER**
We can rebuild this man
Let's do this
These cunts should have to rebuild the house.

These kind of tactics only give us more energy. Maybe they should stop with the moral posturing and see what it's like when you actually care about your fellow brethren. 
Im all for supporting this fine american, but it would be nice to have some background on him before we donate.  We can do things to help them, great things, but we need to check first.
Unacceptable. We must not let people forget where the violence comes from. The left will not continue to revise history. 
Oh so this must be one of the "Trump Hate Crimes" we keep hearing about.
Yeah, but what about all the times people (often with a history of lying), have *claimed* that people *said* stuff that was *mean* to them, and that it was Trump's fault?

Checkmate, Trumpkins.

Kanye knows what is up, rappers were tweeting earlier about #pizzagate and the higher-ups but all were deleted promptly. We know what is going on...
My Kayne respect has shot up from -100 to 1m. <3

The idiot is not an idiot: he's based. 

Edit: prob my most upvoted comment.

Edit2: OMG the karma.
This is extremely strange.

If you had an industry that put all of it's resources into making you the most powerful piece of propaganda for millions of young Americans - and that person decided to test the waters and go DIRECTLY against the vested interests of that industry and it's financiers.. how would you respond?

DISCREDIT. and DISGRACE.

The response is so fucking textbook it hurts. 

"Paranoia" "Unstable" .. they are simply discrediting him for everything he has or may say 

My guess... and I have long thought this. There is a certain someone or some people that have an interest in seeing this "couple" and their family condition the minds of the current teenage generation. And that power of the people CANNOT be used for any other interest then their own.
Being hospitalized for your "mental wellness" is a terrifying experience. Doctors quickly pull a 180 and treat you like a lunatic even when your behavior contradicts such claims.

Day 1: Don't worry. We're only keeping you overnight to make sure you're stable. You'll be released in the morning.

Day 2: Why would we release you? You're in here so there must be something wrong with you.

Day 3: You are frustrated by us keeping you here? Typical mentally unstable behavior. Let's hold you indefinitely...

Nothing can drive a sane person to insanity quicker than the mental health system.
T_D Kanye may be /ourguy/   
  
Pains me to say it - but we need to go get him out of there.   
  
Rough sketch on what we should do:  
  


1. Determine which facility he is at. Plan on protesting at that facility.

2. Find safe areas to protest without disrupting traffic or damaging private property.

3. Contact local law enforcement for their assistance (courtesy, may be needed if it gets large enough).

4. Plan this for whatever day would bring the most people - maybe Saturday.

5. See if we have any members with PA speakers to setup and blast some Kanye tunes (as long as local LEO is cool with it). If they use standard XLR cables we can daisy chain together a bunch of them. Need generator or power inverters.

6. ~~Get some yellow and black signs printed up that match the DNC messaging they emailed us.~~

7. Have our main planners wear shirts easily identifying them as organizers (maybe generic neon yellow) and work to keep the crowd peaceful and inline.

8. Have non local members find a way to donate a reasonable amount of money for supplies, poster boards, large markers, and generic staff shirts.  

9. Once the core plan is in place - blast it out on social media.

something like that.
He has a reputation for saying crazy shit and being eccentric and erratic for a decade. He starts dropping some truth bombs after a major loss for globalism and he's in a strait jacket before the day is over. 
His music is incredible. Kanye is exactly like Trump. People hate Kanye because they're told to hate him. It takes a red pill to love Kanye.

They aren't releasing him. I don't get it, it's ridiculous. I've been in psych wards and they aren't fun when you are there against your will. You have to do EVERYTHING the doctors say or else they will label you as a difficult patient and keep you longer, putting you on dangerous mood stabilizers and possibly electroconvulsive therapy.

this could very well be a one flew over the cuckoos nest type deal.

please pray for Kanye. He is there against his will, and the more he fights the evil the worse it is for him.
This scares the hell out of me. They locked up Kanye and what do you hear from the left? ::crickets:: No one cares. If they don't care about someone who was practically one of their idols being locked up simply for spouting opinions different from theirs, what the hell are these people loyal to?! Who's supposed to stand up for Kanye now??? His own fans -- the ones who have made him rich, loved his art, and touted his in-your-face personality for years -- have completely abandoned him! It's unreal.
I just read that Kim K is friends with Marina the Spirit Cooker. 
After a decade of being a narcissist asshole, he gets committed for endorsing Trump. I though the media loved his outlandish comments.
the downvote bots are upon you
What does Kanye know?
for real fuck creepy doctors

#Pray4Kanye
It's funny that in my state it must be shown that the person is a credible risk of harming others or themselves.

You can't just deprive someone of their constitutional rights because they talk "crazy" or are paranoid. 

We let lots of crazy people walk away because it's their God given right to BE crazy...as long as they aren't a threat to others or themselves. 
Was there anything suspicious with his mother's death 10 years ago?
Psychology is a completely nonsensical unscientific field made up of 90+ percent self identified leftists. Illness will be defined as they see fit and ultimately weaponized. 
MSM and Soros are doing to Kanye what they tried to do to Trump.  Where's Kim, why isn't she supporting her husband?  Was Kanye about to break his silence about Jay-Z and Beyonce's involvement in Pizzagate?
I wish someone could get him out of there :(
Fucking crazy that people aren't making an outrage over this, he isn't a danger to anybody, wants to be left alone, and is being held against his will.
Kanye West has been forced into a mental asylum after speaking in favor of president-elect Trump.

Has this timeline gone too far??
Just so I have this straight, Kanye West was sent to a mental hospital, Soviet Russia style? He starts speaking some truth for a change, so the political elite throws him in a mental ward to discredit him?
they will stick their fingers up your butt if you let them
#FREE MY MAN YEEZY
Is it time for a #FreeKanye?
Hey guys I'm a new mod over at r/whereiskanye

When I get some time off work I'm going to try and set it up better. I didn't make the sub, but if anyone has any information or related things they could share, that would be cool. Unfortunately I don't think you can mod on a phone so I'm gonna try and get a computer.

I know he shouldn't be there. I like him, but I'm not one of those OMG KANYE IS THE BEST EVER guys. But this shit is real and I truly believe he needs our help. If it's too late for Assange, it might not be too late for Ye.

I'm trying not to get my tinfoil hat on too hard but I wonder if he knew this would happen eventually. Maybe that's why he started the whole YEEZUS thing. 

I know it might sound far fetched but most people don't realize how significant symbolism is. 

Anyways guys that's for keeping him in your thoughts. Don't forget.
Brb going to listen to some of his music

# Kanye West in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest
They are probs trying to go MKUltra on the poor guys ass as we speak, never thought i would like kanye until now
He needs to stay away from nailguns, weight rooms and windows of tall buildings. You also never know when you are going to shoot yourself twice in the head from behind. 
Free Kanye!!
i hope he seriously sues the piss out of them when he gets out.
The shade he is dealing with is LITERALLY why I quit that industry.
Crazy how blatant this whole thing is. I mean the guys famous for being loud, gregarious, opinionated and highly vocal. But he starts talking about a certain subject and immediately he's institutionalized against his will? 
Why isn't this all over the news?
I'd really love to hear what Dave Chappelle would say about this particular situation.  It's pretty similar to his 'freakout' and subsequent trip to Africa.  This could be a conspiracy.  It could also be a mental breakdown for all kinds of different reasons.  The latter seems more likely to me without having something concrete.

Keep fighting, Yeezy! Swishahouse's chop of Can't Tell Me Nothin' changed my life.
Nah, he's batshit cray
Do we need to send Ted Cruz in to save Kanye? I'd watch the fuck out of that movie...
Very relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7-s0rCvXFk

Guys don't believe this Kayne shit. His concerts are insured so that if he cannot perform he gets paid. He's making it look like he's lost his damn mind so that he doesn't have to perform under his contracts but won't be liable for breach of contract. His supposed support for Trump is part of the lie so that he can say he only supported Trump because he wasn't in his right mind later. Fuck Kanye. 
Especially if your doctor is someone like Dr Conrad Murray.
Its not paranoia when they actually are out to get you
>The media said he's way out of control

>I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending

>I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control

>I know I'm the most influential, that TIME cover was just confirmation

>This generation's closest thing to Einstein, so don't worry about me; I'm fine.

Kanye must've wrote this about Trump
I work in the mental health field in Florida, and while I am obviously an outsider to the specifics of his situation, it appears to me that Kanye does not meet the criteria for involuntary inpatient commitment. 

Here in the state of Florida the criteria for inpatient commitment is: A. A danger to self or others due to a mental illness, and/or B. Inability to take care of self due to presence of mental illness. California's 5150 statute has roughly the same criteria as here in Florida. 

To summarize, even if Kanye is paranoid, even if he does have some diagnosable mental illness, that alone is not grounds to be placed on an involuntary hold. You must meet the criteria I stated above. 

Now, it could be argued that a Kanye's reported insomnia would be enough evidence to demonstrate lack of self-care, and as such a psychiatrist or other medical professional used that as grounds to involuntarily commit him. Even so, if Kanye's status has improved and he is eating, sleeping, bathing, and not indicating he is a threat to himself or others, then there would not be grounds to continue to hold him, even if he was in fact paranoid. Here in the state of Florida you can also not be forced to take medication unless deemed incompetent, and I'd assume it's the same in California. 

All that said, Kanye has the legal right to challenge this even while involuntarily committed. All Kanye needs to do is contact his lawyer and have him submit a writ of habeas corpus challenging the involuntary hold he is currently under. If he does not meet criteria, then they will be forced to release him. 
OMG, but it just REALLY needs to be STOPPED. Can we all just say a collective prayer for Kanye or SOMEBODY to come through without being murdered?! It just HAS to STOP, we just HAVE to stop these evil deviants.
Who else just bought life of Pablo due to this based man's antics. The album takes on a whole new meaning.
Kanye's Lyric's from: Dark Fantasy have hinted that he's known what's up for a while: 

"You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't
The real one is far to mean
The wattered down, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They it sound all wack and corny
Yes its awful blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiction
Well gather round children
Zip it listen!"


Seems like the story is the story of Elites and Royals that "we think we know". 
Maybe they're hearing it wrong and he doesn't want the doctors to touch his nuts?
The docs are trying to bluepill him, he's resisting
Woke as fuck. Phx
Kanye, without using words, point to where the doctor tried to touch you.

Kanye, that's your heart, he's supposed to put the stethoscope there.
I wouldn't let those cucks touch me either.
Let's go bust him out! 
Free Kanye!  The man is most definitely not crazy (as the mainstream propaganda would have people believe).  He was spitting truth at his concerts and the elites couldn't allow it.
Hope after he survives this he alienates his family from the Kardashians 
If Kanye ever gets out he's gonna be the new assange? 
>West was reportedly going to be released from the hospital Monday but has been struggling with paranoia and is not stable. Us Weekly reported that doctors said West ‚Äúis in no shape to leave‚Äù while his wife Kim Kardashian tried to argue her husband ‚Äúcould recover at home.‚Äù

what is he paranoid of? how is he in no shape to leave? it seems kim thinks he is. this gets more odd as things progress

Credit to them for at least not trying to engage in incredible mental gymnastics.
Props on them for not going all denial on it. 
I'll give the red person this:

That was a civil and hilarious reply. 
The saddest part of all that is it is just another example of Hillary [punching down](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Punching_up) against anyone to the left of her.

The Clintons did this shit in the 90s where they appealed to white America and the South by promising to put a stop to the unruly leftwing unions and to "bring the superpredators to heel" with the tough on crime mandatory minimums, and of course the Defense of Marriage act and Don't ask Don't tell. 

Clintons were always ready to compromise by throwing the far left under the bus to appease the center and the right. Same thing with the 2005 bill. She doesn't give a fuck about the flag or the 1st amendment, she just wanted to gain points by bullying the flag burners.
Finally, a leader that stands up for himself, fights for us, and most importantly, fights for America.  I really think he's enjoying himself.
its even funnier when yoy realize that shit tons of liberals are againsr free speech these days.


during a bernie sanders rally, the berners were shouting "fuck free speech"


in so far as protection of the 1st amendment, we reeeeeeaaaalllly lucked out
Was this 5D chess? Trump makes outrageous statement, gets criticized by left, then shows left said it already. 5D hypocrisy exposure. The left is insane
Lol so perfect at least your buddy seems salvageable 
The proper way to 'retire' an old US flag is to [BURN IT] (http://www.military.com/flag-day/how-to-retire-your-flag.html). Our politicians are quick to make judgement calls but few take the time to learn flag etiquette.

Personally, I wouldn't trust a government that would jail a person over burning a symbol...  
Lulzzz
Haha nice red pilling there.
His response to it was the best part.
It is going to be fun watching Trump toy with the media for the next eight years.

the only appropiate response a Hillary suppourter should have right now.
Trump talks about it, Hillary has done it. Truer every day.

While I don't support a flag-burning law, a lot of Trump's rhetoric exposes the hypocrisy of the left.
New to actually participating on Reddit (long time lurker). Is it required to redact usernames from posts in public subs like in this post or is it at ops disgression?  Thanks

I can't decide which has been better this week,  Trump getting liberals say Castro was a hero just to disagree with him, getting CNN to question if Petraeus is allowed to be SoS after sharing classified information, or getting them to call Trump a fascist for saying people should be imprisoned for burning th  flag just to realize Hillary went a step further and introduced legislation on it.

He's red pilling the masses left and right with a big fat red suppository pill.

I loved how Kennedy on Fox Business, asked Stein if 'this was the way she wanted to be remembered.'
My liberal wife couldn't believe that she didn't need her ID when we went to go vote.  I told her that her side won't allow voter ID laws because they think they are racist.  She didn't believe me.  
Put this man in charge of homeland security.
So it begins - the push for voter ID's. What a time, lads.
#love that guy = mancrush
#VOTER ID
I've read a liberal advocating against voter ID laws because "Poor people can't afford IDs" are they out of their minds? I am poor,VERY poor, so much so I have problems just scraping by and finding money to buy food. 
YET, I HAVE AN ID CARD!

I can't believe in the US getting ID cards is something prohibitively expensive since you're mandated by law to have IDs on you, if you ever get pulled by cops for any reason and you don't...that sucks for you.

I do still want to emigrate to the US, partly because I can't find any work as a Chemist here and partly because I'm confident Trump WILL make the US a better place, but reading this shit upsets me. 

VOTER ID LAWS ARE COMMON SENSE, JESUS HOLY CHRIST!
Funny how they're all now SUPER DUPER concerned with the integrity of the election when they could have had it all along with voter ID which, last I checked, you needed ID to really do anything of substance in life. Can't even use a Redbox or Netflix without a credit card linked to at least SOMEone's ID. I'm firmly convinced if you don't have an ID in 2016 it's because you don't want one or you're not supposed to have one. They're free if you don't have the $35 or whatever it is in your state to pay for one. No excuses
Bless
But ID cards are raysis
Blown. The. Fuck. Out.
So, quick question I'm pretty sure I already know the answer to... 

Say I'm out on vacation in some country that also elects their leaders.  My vacation just so happens to fall during their election. 

Based on everyone's negative reactions to requiring an ID I can only assume that I would be allowed to vote in this other countries election process right?

See I don't get the problem here. We all know there was widespread voter fraud. Isn't it better that Jill Stein and her desperate benefactors pay to prove it? It's wildly entertaining and doesn't cost the taxpayer a dime--basically the same as that hole the Cards Against Humanity guys dug. No matter what this does nothing but help Trump. 
ELI5: how can recounting votes in some 'key' states be concidered acceptable without automatically forcing a recount in the rest of the states also? And if its so easy for the origional count to be inccorrect, what proof is there that the recount will be more accurate?

I love how these libs claim Russian tampering and voter fraud, but hell bent against voter ID.
Has the position of FBI Director been filled yet?
Based Sheriff needs to be positioned to have a run at POTUS when Don is done in 8 years, so we can have a black president who isn't a colossal faggot.
I think we should go after voter ID hard. Try to push it in as many states as possible. If we can get Trump to push it nationally, it can give the state representatives the boost to push it through the state legislatures. 
Hmm, methinks we need to make some MAGA or USA cowboy hats.

Don't you think it would be a nice slam on "shillary" to provide real evidence of wide spread voter fraud? That would show those dirty liberals what's up

John Wayne, Chuck Norris, and Sheriff Clarke.
What's the current status of the recounts?

MI: I don't know.
WI: She's suing to have a hand recount, the judge will probably slap it down? Why is WI even bothering with a non-hand recount?
PA: Stein got high and missed the deadline, recount dead (LOL).
And a test - most of these fools can't even spell vote.
Please make this man head of homeland security.
This man is the black Chuck Norris. Without the Total Gym bullshit, of course.
We have the best sheriffs, don't we?
But but but CNN told me elections can't be rigged!  
With a Republican HOR, Senate, and President congress better put their legislative pens where their mouths are. No excuse to not have a voter ID law within the next two years (unless I'm mistaken & that it would require an amendment)
Buttttttt voter ID is racist!; Black people are not smart enough to get ID!

Her campaign was very low energy. It was sad.
May I add "A money seeking loser"?
Google images of this guy. 
Why is Stein doing this? Is she a Shillary surrogate? I legit thought she was against Shillary before this.
It's always the short haired women
I respected her a lot up until she disrespected the legitimacy of the election (an actual issue) only in the sections that were done properly. Bitch BTFO

David Clarke is so based i want him to fuck my girl.
Need to lock her up so Clarke can show her what it really feels like to *thirst* for a better America. #MAGA
Electronic ballots are a shitty system though, let's em claim people rigged it. 
Is that really destroying? Come on. 
[removed]
Did you spell based wrong? Missing an I?
There's a lot of elderly people who voted for Trump yet can't drive or travel and have neither a passport or driver's license. 

If the government is going to require IDs to vote it must ensure its citizens have a general ID as they do in Germany. 

Also there's a great deal of minorities in the urban South who have neither a Passport or Driver's License yet were still born in the US. 

Republicans only require IDs where it suits them. Thus voter ID laws to prevent minorities from voting not the elderly.

So much wall. Many high. Very MAGA!
Literally lol'd.
Or a fuckin repost,jackass trump supporter
Because the Admins are pieces of leftist cucked shit.
Fuck you u/Spez 
Anyone here saw the illegal botting by ets post with legit screenshots(they had an userscript to filter and downvote all our posts)? It was highly ranked in the top-1hr section a little while ago, but looks like the mods/admins removed it. 
Everyone needs to stop pretending they don't realize reddit is run by leftists. Do you really think they're going to make it a level playing field?
Id also like to add that there are mutliple posts on that sub DAILY which specifically adress /r/the_donald in its title. 

How does this not condone brigading?

(It does) 


How is this not an infraction against site wide rules regarding brigading?

(It is)
Because the admins are pinko commie cucks.
Rules for thee, not for me.
Something I posted a few hours ago that fits in this thread:

Reddit is in San Francisco, run by people who live in one of the most liberal cities in the country. They have allowed the takeover of the largest domreddit r/ [redacted] to promote their left views and corrupt candidate. The CEO has proven himself to be an immature and corrupt crybaby who thinks of Reddit as his personal playground and doesn't realize the current power and nature of what he help create so long ago. r/The_Donald is the antithesis of the lying left that is rampant on Reddit. There is a reason Trump won and Hillary lost. People are fed up with this kind of shit and Hillary became synonymous with corrupt and crazy, just as r/ [redacted] and u/ [Reddit CEO] have. 

This post may have been edited by u/ [crybaby spez]


We're playing on hard mode.  They're playing on easy mode.

It wouldn't be fair otherwise.
Sloppy sis sub dude. They don't have any standards they can hold to.
This should be stickied daily until anyone on /r/The_Donald can freely mention /r/redacted at anytime or link to other reddit pages using np urls. 

BS Double Standards like this undermine the entire site.
I used to like Reddit, but now they've outed themselves as being part of the swamp.
Fuck u/spez 
Mods can you sticky this? It would look nice at the top of /all.

Also: fuck /u/spez
The good thing is, though, all of this cuckholdery is really doing nothing but bring more attention to the lies and biases of the left.
Delete your account

/u/spez 


There are several tools that have been published with the express intent to single out users on the_donald and to downvote all posts here. 

https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/search?q=the_donald


Calling /u/spez . We need an explanation on this shit.
Out of all the political subreddits, they are by far the worst imo. They have like 10 other subreddits with the same purpose. They don't have even the slightest shred of proof with what they say, and will search through new for racist posts so they can post it (with the karma hidden btw) so they can claim we are all racist. Oh and then post every single day asking for the admins to remove this sub as if it is anywhere near as bad as fph was. I could make a whole list tbh. It is like all the sjw Hillary supporters thought (redacted) wasn't bad enough, that they had to make their own subreddit.
Fuck u/spez
Because authoritarian leaning people use tactics like that to force ideologies on others. We are the tribe of "Leave us the fuck alone!". They are the tribe of, "Wait! Where are you going and what are you doing and is it something I approve of".
Reddit mods will do nothing to help us, everything to hinder. They are all bought and sold liberals except for a few (and we appreciate those few even though we don't typically know who).

We just have to keep our truthful news, keen shitposts, and high energy in hopes to awaken the brainwashed liberal walkers who occasionally take a peek here in hopes they wake up from their terrible dream.

And by the climbing T_D numbers... looks like it's working DESPITE the unreasonable hate toward us.
Holy shit that subreddit is toxic.
They watch other men fuck their wives. This is the only way the can feel a little bit of power. Very low energy. 
Oh and don't forget /r/[redacted]
They can come after me, send em by the thousands, not a single shill will get under my skin
Message the admins about it to get an answer.
The same reason that shit reddit says has been allowed to for years.

The admins are libtards with an agenda to push.
Harassment goes here. https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us
One user said how obsessed we are with Hillary in a obsessed anti-trump reddit 
Because no one is on EnoughTrumpSpam to notice other than a few remaining CTR shills. You really have to have a population before rules mean much
They always link to this sub, isnt that considered brigading? I even seen some of those idiots openly discussing bot strategies and vote brigading.
and they try to accuse us of brigading.  

Alex Trebek: The answer is "Cucks!!!"

Contestant:  Who runs Eddit?

Alex Trebek: Correct.

Report them.
To be honest I like when infantile cucks cry their impotent little cuck tears in private messages to me. 

Their tears sustain me.

Setting something on fire to incite violence is already a crime. It doesn't matter if its a flag or a boot or a 17" cunt destroyer dilldozer, setting something on fire to attack someone with is always illegal. 
Is u/ctofaname banned from here?
Don't you know subs which exist solely to harass other subs & users of this website are okay provided they're left-wing? And the mods of the defaults have the tenacity to claim that we harass them.


they can go right ahead and use my username. every part of it is throwaway by design so they will have to try pretty hard to doxx me
Yuppity - they downvoted a post where I said "Love One Another" so it would be hidden, and then put a dagger in it.  They deliberately hide tolerant posts, and seek out racist ones... and if they can't find anything poisonous enough to suit them, they will post it themselves. 

**¬°YaY! JESUS LOVES YOU! LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL!!! LOVE TRUMPS HATE! BABY GOATS ATE MY RAINBOW!!!!**

There, that should do it...



fuck /u/spez
We aren't salty.
We've been dealing with this in the conspiracy *community* for years now (first with /r/conspiratard and then with /r/TopMindsOfReddit).

It's OK to have bully subs if it's against a particular group of users. 
For the same reason SRS is still here after years of constant vote bridgading. Even though the evidence that they have doxxed and vote bridgaded is overwhelming, they are still allowed to have their subreddit up. 

Reddit admins have always been in bed with the far left crybullies SJWs on Reddit. And now, they're desperately trying to take down our subreddit because it's "offensive" 
This is why we hate you u/spez. You are biased and corrupt. You embody the problems of American government.
because minorities can't be subist.
And they're wrong lmao. The 2005 flag protection act she introduced calls for banning flag burning, period. 

>(a)(1) Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. (2) This subsection does not prohibit any conduct consisting of the disposal of a flag when it has become worn or soiled.

>(b) As used in this section, the term "flag of the United States" means any flag of the United States, or any part thereof, made of any substance, of any size, in a form that is commonly displayed.

>(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of Congress to deprive any State, territory, possession, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the absence of this section.

>(d)(1) An appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court of the United States from any interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order issued by a United States district court ruling upon the constitutionality of subsection (a). (2) The Supreme Court shall, if it has not previously ruled on the question, accept jurisdiction over the appeal and advance on the docket and expedite to the greatest extent possible.
Because just like everything else about this election- they have a different set of rules. 
Fuck Spez and his girlfriends bull
We're a sub based on supporting the president. They're a sub literally based on hating specifically us. Literally a harassing subreddit. They're like if SRS had a meme sub where the OP of every top post reeks of butthurt. I can sense how they suffer from low T.
¬°YaY! we WIN!!!!
I like how the comment was a straight up lie. The bill said "burning a flag *can* be used to incited violence, therefore the government cannot protect it under the first amendment as a freedom of political expression."
Answer: we are the red headed bastard step-children of reddit. we are tolerated, barely. we are like Cinderella after her father died. Trump is our prince. It's ok, we can toil away shitposting in the basement of reddit but we still keep on winning. 

(no offense to gingers intended)
Who cares about enoughtrumpspam?  They are powerless if you ignore their ignorant asses.
I quite frankly don't care if they do that to me.

My online footprint is very small, and I'm not on Twitter/Facebook/Istagram/Tumblr/Linkedin. There are no photos of me online.

Good luck trying to dox me, chumps.
Private and public positions 
I don't know much about reddit bots, but someone should make a sub that mirrors every comment in enoughtrumpspam and replaces every user mention with /u/spez.

Make him see directly how much bullshit that sub pulls.  Not that it will change anything.  Fuck /u/spez
One of those cucks in the screen shot proposed Trump rewrite the constitution using memes. I think we have an insider/ double agent. Brilliant.
Sure it's a double standard, but who gives a fuck if they PM you. It's not harassment if you can easily block it. Stop calling it that. It's just something new to laugh at. 
I got banned from hillaryclinton for linking to the wikipedia article. For  "trolling" and "false information"
I'm curious what you all think about flag burning being legal or not. 

Personally I think it should be legal, even if it's a very disagreeable thing to do. Let society judge whoever burns a flag and shame them on social media. Govt doesn't need to do anything extra. 
Start the clock.  How long until YouTube takes the video down.

What? Video evidence?! Doctored by that shifty James O'Keefe!
Someone repost this on another videocsite
**S**
> Here's a video of it. 

Rekt. 
How about passing a law that gives veterans and active troops a pass to defend the US flag if they wish to do so if it is being burned or disrespected. Let them rough up flag burners.
TIL that a Tweet is LITERALLY the same thing as submitting/co-sponsoring a bill in the US Congress.

[The more you know!](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/620/586/800.jpg)
OMG, more Russian propaganda.  They've been doing it since 2005!
Well, I'll put it this way. Flag burning shouldn't be illegal, but I kinda think whoever does that should be forced to do some volunteer work at the VA. Maybe that way they might learn a little patriotism and have a little bit of gratitude for the phenomenal freedoms we do have.
She'd sponsor diazepam pens if they paid her enough. 
Trump = Level 9000 Troll

He tweets "outrageous" things because he knows that the MSM will go full retard and that Hillary Clinton has made the very same statements years before him.
Why are we burning flags? Let's stop being children and acting like sore losers, instead protest with your voice and leave flags unburnt....  The flag represents the country we live in, we aren't communist here, and people just need to honestly chill the fuck out..

And yeah I say if you burn the flag and it's caught then you should have to pay a price..  if you hate this country, get out...  simple
**BTFO**
Let them burn the flag, it let's us know who the enemy is
Dude Trump means what he says that's why I voted for him
Nice find centipede
That's "video" shop sir.
I find your evidence is a hate crime!
So I read the bill and the way it is worded makes it able to be interpreted in many ways but I would like to point out that it does say
> (b) Actions Promoting Violence.‚ÄîAny person who destroys or damages a flag of the United States with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace, and under circumstances in which the person knows that it is reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace, shall be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.

> (c) Flag Burning.‚ÄîAny person who shall intentionally threaten or intimidate any person or group of persons by burning, or causing to be burned, a flag of the United States shall be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both.

Like I said, this can be stretched and intimidation and inciting violence could be stretched to allow any flag burning, and I don't trust HRC not to allow this to be stretched, I'm just point something out. I believe if you want to burn the flag, go ahead it should be allowed but just heavily looked down upon.
This subreddit is the gift that keeps on giving.
Archive ARCHIVE **ARCHIVE**

The Hillary History Scrubbers lurk among us...
UPVOTE! TO THE TOP!
There's also a Wikipedia page on it. Her and someone else proposed the idea. Kek 
im dying to know what peoples reaction is in /redacted who downvote that link. are they just trying to pretend it didnt happen?
This shit happened around the time when she also brought up that violent video game ban Bill. How the fuck can this woman  be so fucking stupid? 
Trump should create a new cabinet position titled "Flag Defender", who's job it will be to seek out and prosecute flag burning crimes, and nominate Hillary.  Flag Czar? Bwahahaha 
I think Trump is baiting the Soros-funded protesters to come out of the woodwork. Flag burning is just a small aspect to what they're doing.

They're also blocking roads, waving communist, Mexican and ISIS flags, smashing windows, damaging police cars.

They'll come out in full force to protest and burn flags in defiance. And that is when President Trump, already sworn in, can sweep them up at once with heavily armed riot police.

The bait has been set. Let's wait for the mouse to approach the trap.
OK, so... Hillary supported something Trump now supports. Is that supposed to be a good thing? 
http://www.gq.com/story/why-angry-white-men-love-calling-people-cucks
I hated Hillary too. How can people be behind trump on the flag burning regardless of Hilldog
If the 1st covers everything up to and including the burning of the flag, then the 2nd should cover everything up to and including me driving a tank to work.


I think we should make it legal for our veterans to assault people who burn the flag. Seems like a fair compromise. 
One does not excuse the other, and both are horrendous.
You're right. It's wrong for Hillary and it's wrong for Trump. 
[removed]
Please stop trying to justify Trumps actions with HRC's actions.  You are undermining yourself.  When HRC proposed this, it was adamantly fought against by both sides of the aisle.  It was a bad idea then, its a bad idea now.  You cannot start throwing people in jail for burning a piece of cloth.  And if you say "its more than just a piece of cloth", then you are throwing people in jail for having an opinion.  That is a very bad idea.  You are allowed to disagree with a really bad idea, and still be a Trump supporter. 
[removed]
Why is Clinton even relevant to Trump's recent tweet? She's not the president-elect. Both Trump and Clinton are WRONG for attempting to punish flag burners.
The great thing about archive is your fucking script can't read it admins.

Game on.
maybe the mods banned the word piz za
Will the fuckery ever end?

How is that allowed to exist but people can't talk about Adults kidnapping children and possibly murdering/raping them? We are living in a backwards society and we need to right the fucking Ship.

* Unflattering photo

Pick one.
Reminder: they're now referring to him as their president-elect. 
seriously we post this face all the time lmfao

this must be some sort of deep cover centipede trolling
We make the best weird faces don't we folks?

They just don't understand what is like to win so hard
They even locked their own thread. Low Energy
They say unflattering, I say fucking hilarious.
If he hates when that face is posted he must despise the_donald.
[removed]
Liberals, forever projecting.
literally my face when I saw that thread.
You know how we'd feel if Hillary won.... that's how libs feel about trump and it's fucking glorious. They have to look at his face and listen to him for 8 years. LOL.
I've grown into these Trump Facial Expressions irl, and this one is my favorite.
Stupid liberals don't know how to meme. This is why they lost. kek.
I actually loved this: http://i.imgur.com/vHEUIt2.jpg
Wasn't  this the face he made when he saw hillary  getting  chucked  in her van like a side of beef?
This only shows that they don't understand anything.
Jesus are they really that dumb? This is literally a top 3 favorite pic of Don, and they actually think it bothers us **Lmao**
[removed]
TOO THE TOP THEY NEED TO SEE THIS!
They are literally using an old meme of ours under the assumption that we dislike it. These people belong in a psych ward lol
#Totally false!  If I wanted it, I would have gotten it.
Are you kidding me, that's the best face 
Wow, hard-hitting stuff there!  I'm getting the feeling that the 2018 and 2020 elections are going to be pretty easy!
They're SJWs. The thing to remember, when they say the face is unflattering, they don't mean it's unflattering to Donald, but that the expression makes **them** feel unflattered.

Just consider the long history of seeing that expression on the faces of others. That's why it triggers them so!
I upvoted the r/politics post just because I like seeing his face at the top of r/all. 

They really suck at this.  
Trump has the best facial expressions.
lol when I saw that post I thought 'aww that's nice they're trying'
This is the best trump face.

How is this not the best trump face.
Are they really that stupid to spam pictures of Trump to try to annoy us?
#I LOVE THIS PHOTO
THEY'RE NOT SENDING THEIR BEST!
We literally post this all the time, I don't understand why they think we hate the funny face photos? There's a million photos of Trump making funny faces and we always use them in our memes... 
We have the best unflattering photos don't we folks?
I LOVE THIS FACE AND THIS MAN
Lol I saw that post and commented "We over at The_Donald totally approve of this top kek material" and of course I was downvoted into oblivion xD
I find this expression heartwarming.
Unlike these SJW hambeasts, at least he has flattering photos. 
So spicy
Edit: we can't promise this post wasn't edited by /spez
My favorite face!
Who is he mocking on this picture? That's my mocking face too always draw a laugh
MRW I Checkmate in one move
They are not sending their best. 
Not impressed by such low energy 
They're trying to mock his appearance? They think he cares?

He's a multi-billionaire, got elected president, and is married to a hot former model.

Newsflash - he don't care. It don't matter.

Keep trying tho.
We have the best faces don't we folks?! 
Unflattering? More like PRICELESS! We love these!
Looking at the comment section, this backfired horribly on them. Mods had to lock thread to prevent further embarrassment of themselves.
I love this face and I do it all the time IRL
Every silly face is endearing. 
Is there even such a thing as an unflattering Trump photo? 
They can't seriously think posting such a glorious face will make us angry. I just don't get these people, so easy to fool and troll. 
I make this face about 20 times a day at work. 
When your trolling fails so hard you have to lock the comments.
I actually and seriously love this facial expression from him. They can't use this to stump. LOL
MFW I'm just trying to MAGA and everyone's calling me Hitler.
They literally posted our reaction to the post itself, as the main content of the post. This is 4d Chessception.
YOU'RE JUST EMBARRASING YOURSELF REDACTED
We have the greatest faces don't we?
If they want to spread hilarious images of our next President, do it! We love free advertising, don't we folks?
I want this face to be on on the bigly dollar bill.
Even the original post gives Donald the look of "You serious? Lol"
My liberal Facebook friends like to put Trump up on their wall like this. I just respond by saying what a beautiful man he is. 
Is this their attempt to copy our Byrd photo? Cause this is a pretty empty attempt. 
They really don't get it, do they?  They just don't get it even on a very basic level.  
It just looks like a based alpha male reacting to the stupidity of cucks. I see nothing wrong.
I love this pic, reminds me of my father and his father before him, all great men.
That's his impression of Hillary
Thats my favorite face tbh
That thread got locked right as I was about to send some cuck to the dumpster. Good thing PM's exist lol
I like how they're acting like this is so uncommon. Holy shit, people don't like unflattering pictures of themselves?! BREAKING NEWS.
I think they have President Trump and shill Beyonce mixed up
Sad the worst they got on Trump is the faces he makes and his skin color. 
>YFW you win an election, twice. 
Are you even trying fewels!?
I thought this was his "You crazy libtards!" face....
Is THAT why they think it is "unflattering"?


They can't touch us when it comes to shit-posting and winning.

#THIS IS THE FACE OF WINNING!
fuck  /u/route67
Is this what the cucks are reduced too?

Ha, how the fuck did we ever lose to these dickheads?
Such low energy
Unflattering Trump picture? Impossible. Trump makes the best faces, folks.
I LOVE THIS PIC! THE DON MAKES THE BEST FACES!
Cucks projecting as usual.
Seriously, who the fuck ever said that we didn't like "unflattering" photos of our president? Have people seen the things we post? lmao pathetic cucks.
I love president Donald Trump. He is a sweet man and I hope to meet him one day. 
He's like that weird uncle you love seeing at Christmas
The picture is funny. We don't get triggered as easy as the Left. Also, Trump does not give a shit about an 'unflattering' pic or one with him making a funny expression.

Just look at his cover for 'Crippled America'. He said he purposely picked the roughest looking pic of them all and didn't want them to airbrush or photoshop anything.
Trump's expression here is 100% like "omg what in the world made the cucks think I even have the time to give a shit whether they use this picture or not?!" lolol
One of these has been my desktop background for the better part of six months. I can't not laugh. 
>cucks in charge of trolling

It's like how they troll their wife by letting them sleep with other men.
I WANT TO KISS THIS FACE 
I want to design and bake a cake in the form of this meme and eat it.
This is the face he had when typing out the flag burning tweet.

I guarantee it.
Can I get a transparent .png of these?
WHY IS THIS SUB SO FUCKING INCREDIBLE. FUAAAAAA THE WINNING!!!
"I can't imagine somebody booing, these are people that wanna kill us folks"

Man, that was back when I watched all the debates and rallies. This picture brings back memories. Good job Shills
What you see is him actually sucking in and neutralizing the toxic radioactive energy from the well-known smug Obama face to save us all from it's explosive failure fallout.
I saw this earlier on that low energy sub. I tried to comment that I really liked this trump face. It's close to his smug face, but nothing can match smug trump IMO 
Pretty pathetic that this is all they got.....
I don't know about the God Emperor, but I find these pictures pretty funny
Pretty great that the one silly face of Trump epitomizes the constant face of most Democrats.

Doing a [Michael Moore Impression](http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/style592x333/public/may7_michael.jpg) and didn't even try.
LOVE THIS!!!!  PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP SAYING,"PUHLEEEZE CUCKS!"

I make the same face when I smell bullshit. 
implying all pictures of trump aren't amazing
I know, when I saw that I immediately felt bad for the poor fella that came up with that. Poor guy.. Wonder what it's like to be a KEK. **insert crying**
I do not think anyone likes unflattering photos of themselves on the internet
Shit, I wish I looked this good.

100%. Murderous dictators are okay as long as they support universal health care.

Liberal mind fuck.
>one has to wonder whether they would take that bargain: No more elections, no more free speech, no more civil liberties of any kind, but socialized medicine and literacy for everyone


He's he's being sarcastic. But it seems that's what the Liberals really want. A dictator who will give them free health care and  abortions
Idiots that sit at their comfy homes and talk as if the Cuban revolution went like one of their Civ game matches and that Castro created a fair and prosperous society. what a bunch of dumbshits.

No wonder they were on the losing side this election. They don't know how to get work done  IRL.
Who is downvoting this? CTR?? Triggered!
I'm surprised this article was allowed out of the depths of CA.
#LOOOoooooOOOOOOL

It would be a shame if the folks at r/[redacted] saw this.
I supported Fidel Castro 100%. He was only trying to advance humanity. I even let him have sex with my wife, just to show how devoted I was to his cause. He will be missed. Especially in my bedroom.
This is amazing, but the rest of that typically liberal rag needs to catch up and stay consistent.
3 weeks after the election and I can already see the cracks forming in the MSM. Most of these people do not lack actual intelligence. Its becoming very clear, very quickly to these people that the truth bombs are just gonna keep coming the more people get woke.

I wouldn't even call them useful idiots.  I'd call them [stupid idiots.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sii10Xt0pdo)
FYI Goldberg was one of the main never-Trumpers. He's right about this.. but I dont know if I'd call him "based"
Jonah Goldberg?
It is Jonah Goldberg, after all. 
Ehhh...I'm not going to be given the ultimatum to either subscribe or turn off my ad-blocker in order to read it. The title is enough for me.
Most of the comments to that article try to discredit the column by pointing out that Castro overthrew a horrible, US-supported dictator. What does that have to do with the ensuing half-century of brutal oppression? It's mind-boggling. 
Articles mentions how leftist throw heaps of praise for Cuba on having no illiteracy & free healthcare, but never mention Israel for having the same thing.

Despite Israel being a democracy with free press & human rights. All things Cuba does not have. 

Kinda hypocritical.
"American political dissidents, homosexuals, journalists and the clergy, just like in Cuba, can languish in prison or internal exile, but at least they‚Äôll be able to read the charges against them."

WEW
I saw this on r/Miami and I still cant believe there are people that like Castro and praise him. My entire life my family told me what a piece of shit he was. Now that he's dead and I see people praising him and saying how great he was and rewriting or ignoring history. Meanwhile we had a fucking party in Miami. What the fuck is going on? 
HEY.... HEY!! let's be careful with the name calling... ok people?
 Our Prime Minister is by NO means "useful"....
Just pointing out....*based OPINION writer*...hardly reflective of the LA Times as a whole.  Coastal CA is NOT our friend.
Jonah Goldberg is a syndicated columnist.
Seems this writer is taking his click-bait lines straight from r/The_Donald, if you ask me. As far as I can tell, this is the only place to find anyone referencing useful idiots in the current zeitgeist. These jorno clowns these days do not have a useful or original bone in their bodies.
Unbelievable. Good for them, I can't believe it 
Some of those comments gave me Scurvy.
Heard his bastard son is doing well in Canada though!
Fidel and Bill were tight. Shared the same cigar fetish.
Anyone with a quarter of a goddamn brain wouldn't praise Fidel Castro. It's not hard to read a history book or watch a fucking documentary about him. 
Castro credited NY Times with his victory in Cuba
I just watched Geraldo Rivera give Castro a post-humous BJ on Tucker.
Also of note, 

**The LA Times: The only news organization that managed to get polling anywhere near reality.**
La times is anything but based. This article is a unicorn
This is an opinion piece by jonah goldberg. Check out the video they posted at the top of this, its basically fellating castro. 
Maybe I should start reading LA Times
Why is there discussion of Castro on the_donald?

Whether or not he was a good leader we need to have healthy US Cuban relations moving forward. This will be good for both parties
LA Times have taken a little nibble of the red pill
Random act of journalism. 
Good article, even if the king of GOP cucks wrote it. 
This is the spice you only put in curry. Whew, lads!

It would be such a huge accomplishment to relieve us of OPEC dependence. It's extremely uncomfortable relying on any of those countries, almost every single one in OPEC is run by the world's biggest pieces of shit. The spread of wahhabism throughout the middle east from the beginning of the 70s, through present day, is a direct result of us making the Saudi's a strategic ally for oil and against communism (no longer a problem that needs physical confrontation). 
I'm all for anything that cuts out fucking Saudi. 

These are our current oil imports.

Canada	3.76 (40%)	0.96	2.81
Saudi Arabia	1.06 (11%)	0.00	1.06
Venezuela	0.83   (9%)	0.07	0.75
Mexico	0.76   (8%)	0.69	0.07
Colombia	0.40   (4%)	0.17	0.22

11% can go to Canada and not Saudi and I would be so so down for that.

0% Saudi imports would be awesome. 


How about we just drill for our *own* oil?
Canadian here. This is good news as Alberta's economy is sliding into the shitter after the Saudi's flooded the market with their oil.

PS: Stop buying oil from terrorists and socialists, buy our fucking oil!
As a Canadian-pede I am excited for a higher energy dollar :D
Oil sands are too expensive to produce currently with such high supply and since there is a battle for market share currently with the Saudis (that we are losing handily) I doubt we will ramp up production anytime soon.

Source: Am Petroleum Engineer
I have to chuckle at how hippies have hijacked the North Dakota protests...
We would LOVE if Trump did this. The west of Canada is struggling hard right now. Our own pipelines aren't being approved in favour of buying oil overseas to supply our east coast... 
Meanwhile us Canadians will continue to import 625,000 bpd from the Saudis and others into eastern Canada, because a couple so called environmentalists somehow think they`re saving the environment by blocking a pipeline which would reduce emissions, reduce costs and improve public safety. 
hmm. Kelly-Anne for sec of high energy? 


I said this should have been done years ago, super glad to see it's happening. Without oil money these people are back to living in mud huts. 
Their economy is fucked. Their population might actually have to get jobs now.
If we stop buying oil from terrorist, drill our own, and buy from North and South America. We will kill the saudi's economy while improving our own and hopefully opening up some South and Central American countries to the idea of capitalism.

This is 100% what we should be doing right now.
Rather give business to our neighbors up north. Very good people those Canadians I tell ya! 
I agree! Get rid of Saudi Oil!

t. Canuck with too much unsold oil
As a Canadian this makes me happy. We need to be a mofuckin team and keep these liberal shits out for the rest of our lives. I think we will follow your foot steps soon. 
As long as we don't have to fucking call it petrol.
BERTA!!! Our province is looking forward to hosting the beautiful Kelly Anne. 
I really hope we also put good money towards clean energy products, while also moving away from Saudi oil.

Whether or not Climate change is real, clean energy (if/when it becomes viable) that's renewable will be the thing that allows our country to become free. Free from ANY foreign energy interests, whether it be OPEC or even Canada.

Imagine an entire country, where oil/gas costs are almost nonexistent. Where the third world is begging, BEGGING for us to buy their shitty oil so they can keep their hold over our country, and we can look down and say "no."

That world is something I cannot wait for.
#DOPEY PRINCE BTFO!
When this economy starts pumping after our massive tax cuts, demand will skyrocket and we will need this supply more than ever. Plus all the untapped us supply.. can't wait to watch the middle East crumble in poverty like the rest of the world has, as we say FUCK YOU YOU ISLAMIC TERRORIST SPONSORING FUCKS.
WE don't need canda oil we can do coal to oil 
Rock on!
This pipeline has become a touchy subject but I WANT TO STOP DEPENDING ON FOREIGN OIL AND MAKING OTHER PEOPLE RICH! LETS BE GREAT AGAIN
But Obama said it would only create 3 jobs... 3. Did he lie?
Cutting oil tanker traffic would massively reduce pollution worldwide.
Google bretton Woods and petrodollar
If we did this we could possibly end wars in the Middle East for by not fighting for oil over there.
coming from /r/exmuslim those bastards need to get hit where it hurts
Nuclear power. Clean. Safe. And the biggest fuck you Saudi Arabia possible today. 
There is nothing to be gained by ever visiting Fort MacMurray.


we're gonna need to drill more oil.  Not only so that North america can be self sufficient... but so that we can help other nations (Britain, France, Netherlands, Italy) also be free of Terrorist Oil.
As an Albertan this is almost bringing tears to my eyes. Not only is he going to make America great again he's going to make Canada great too.
*"But muh carbon footprint and UN Climate Treaty! Muh renewable energy! Muh solar panels!"*
No more money to the pedo camel jockeys! out out out towel headed cousin-fuckers! 

It was my understanding Saudi Arabia (along with Qatar and the UAE) is going to be paying us trillions in reparations starting Spring 2017. 
This is a tricky one - the thing is - it's not really going to impact the Saudi's if we buy our oil elsewhere or just produce it ourselves.  Other countries that buy oil from us will just buy less of it (because we're using it and the price will be higher) and will start buying more from Saudi.  It's kind of a wash when going about it this way since oil is a global commodity with many producers.  Truthfully - I'd rather us keep our reserves healthily intact and burn up Saudi oil so if shit really ever hits the fan - we have plenty to produce locally to keep the country running.
I've moved to North Dakota to make roll in the fracking game. We're making oil. Enough that the US exports oil now. Why do you think the price of oil is so low? We joined the oil game. That tar sand is commie Canadian crap compared to the shale oil we make in the u s of a  
If we can take full use of coal, then we don't even have to reply on oil. 
Now to bring that american oil to EU also, never mind, I forgot abt the bases in Germany
What does this mean for gasoline prices 
US entanglement with Saudi Arabia and OPEC is much more complicated then buying oil. The true tie and power they have over the US is the petrodollar system. Which the US government, well more the FED, abuses the shit out of by printing money constantly while being able to diffuse inflationary effects.
Buying oil from terror sponsors both indirectly and directly supports terrorism.
Serious question my deplorable chums.  I'm all for energy independence and enervating powerful, Islamic scoundrels, but what happens if the petrodollar falls out of popularity?  My assumption is the economic benefits of refocusing on America first will more than counterbalance any loss to our currency's dominance, never mind it being right thing to do regardless of the economic outcomes, but I would appreciate the input of someone better versed on the subject.
China and India will use Saudi oil. They don't give a shit.

They don't have feminists and other leftist retards destroying their country, so they have all the advantages to gain here.
I wonder if this would be overall savings if you factor in all the headaches and military spending required to deal with OPEC. 

Plus the damage to relations with Russia which I don't know you can even put a price on. Although Saudi Arabia does offset Iran in the region.
finally we are off the Saudi black skag

**CUT OFF MONEY TO SAUDI ARABIA - NO BUYING THEIR OIL, NO SELLING THEM TECH OR WEAPONS. BOYCOTT SAUDI and ALL ISLAMIST STATES**
--
Serious question. Wouldn't it be economically smart to push for renewble energy sources? I know that this may be an unpopular opinion on this subreddit, but what qre the economic downsides to just pushing for renewable energy? We are too dependent on terrorist oil. 
Is Trudeau going to cockblock this?
No more Saudi oil?? If The Donald manages to do this, I will no longer be an atheist. He'll be my new God.
This is GREAT NEWS!
It's about time we seriously give OPEC the middle finger...

SO hoping this comes true...
The leafs are cucks but at least they're not hateful. 
Be amazing to see the CBC forced to air positive coverage of Trump.
The Oil Sands are a terrible source of oil. They destroy an enormous area and the oil barely returns a profit.
we don't need foreign oil at all. We just need to open federal lands and cut back on the regulations a bit. We have 100 years of proven reserves of natural gas. Plenty of time for us to innovate our way into a sustainable energy solution that doesn't require government funds to force us to use renewables. We can capitalist the shit out of renewables for once!
solar energy please!!
As a Canadian I look forward to the Oil Sands being shut down. The original name which was also a very accurate description was "Tar Sands" 

The oil, after being sufficiently processed to enable transport via pipelines still contains many impurities not found in oil from other countries that make it very abrasive and corrosive to pipelines and a greater threat to the environment.


Fuck Canada too! We have a whole bunch of oil right here in Texas and New Mexico and a whole bunch of people needing to go back to work. I thought this was supposed to Make "America" Great Again...fuck Canada!!

Good find, I wonder what the "opportunity" was. 
If BTFO'ing globalists, destroying shit like this, and making gov more transparent is the ONLY good thing Trump ends up doing then he will have saved our nation, no matter what else happens.

Yep this has been going on all over the world from various different countries and governments.  Probably a big reason why the internet has a reputation for being a toxic cesspool in comments sections of politically important topics.
How is no one talking about the domain name being HBGary. I thought other anons on /pol/ were joking about never visiting this domreddit. 
Wow
The President of ALL Americans
Tennessee is still waiting on Obsma's comments and help from the floods a fews years ago. On second thought Tenn. is made up of based Americans , they helped each other and themselves.
Say it with me now:

#PRESIDENTIAL AS FUCK!
YES.  Thank you from the smoky state of TN.  
A true president, someone who truly cares. Where's Barry, out golfing again?
#**THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT!**

My family lost a lot in these fires.
I was waiting for this and he didn't disappoint!
One tweet from the GOD EMPEROR is already more attention than these fires have gotten from the entire lamestream media. 

#PRESIDENTIAL
The guy with the climate change reply can eat a dick. 
[deleted]
I knew he would send love when I saw that liberal idiot trending saying he was happy Trump supporters' houses were burning.  President Trump always pulls through!  MAGA!
Any fucking word from the s(h)itting President on this?  Or on OSU?  Was dead silent on the riots also.  Zero leadership, very sad. 
Daddy God-Emperor is looking out for everyone.
THIS President CARES. Endless empathy. Endless energy.
Where is Obongos tweet praising the fires for their heat?
Knoxville represent!  It's so refreshing to have a leader who actually seems to care about the country he serves!  MAGA!!!
Do we have any East TN centipedes here?  PM me, I need based friends.
Love how he talks & communicate s to the people...MAGA
Another reason why I love this man. When recruiters were shot in Chattanooga, we had to raise hell before President Bobdrama even responded. 
I live 1 exit from Tennessee and have worked there for 6 years. Love the state, love the smokies, a terrible, terrible tragedy there.


#To donate, text REDCROSS to 90999 to give $10 to American Red Cross Disaster Relief
Meanwhile Obama silent on terrorist attack yesterday. Probably he's stuck trying to justify his disastrous agenda. IFIFIFIFIFIFIF......
I wouldn't be surprised if he's already organizing aid to the area. 
#ThatsOurPresident 
One of the few contexts where "Stay Safe" is a legitimate sentiment.
The fires have been crazy and now Gatlinburg has been hit bad it's awesome to have a president elect say something like this.
I love this man!
Where's Obama? Where's Waldo?
This guy is so on top of stuff. 
Presidential 
Visited a college friend in Atlanta and the smoke from the fires was there. You could really see it when landing and, later, at take off from the airport. 

It was bad a week ago. And that shit is still going on? Atlanta literally smelled like a campfire.

Jeez, yeah, thoughts and all that stuff to the people going through this crap.
I drove past there coming back from thanksgiving in East Tennessee. I actually fully planned on camping south of Maryville for a couple nights, but I cucked out bc I thought it was gonna rain a bit. One time being a cuck served me! 
I Love you Trump!
I find it really weird nobody is talking is talking about it on the news, I mean, forget left/right politics, usually MSM eat up natural disasters like moneycakes. 

I didn't find out about these fires until I got home on reddit.

Get this patriot a coat!
You voted for him.. but you didn't know? Kudos. However what you perceive as "dumb" is not. That is precisely why he is our next President. Many of us understand him. i.e. people who dont like him take him literally, the rest if us take hom seriously. Big difference.
the only thing i'll say is don't JUST get your ves from us. get info from everywhere. detraction helps us focus and form arguments. Sometimes we seem crazy because we can't actually debate liberals. it alwys turns out bad. 

they are pushing an agenda it is clear, it's the reason this sub blew up. we needed a place to not get censored
'Course we're crazy much of the time.  I assure you, much of it is well-considered, intentional crazy.  Why the hell should we fight by "their" rules - or even try to - when it puts us at a tactical disadvantage and just causes us casualties?

Fuck that.  Insanity is repeating the same action and expecting a different result.

We've evolved into being the crazy sumbitch hanging out of a helicopter with a cavalry sword trying to behead the enemy, and having discovered it's *extremely goddamned entertaining* and *effective* to go up against them in such a way...well, of course we've doubled down!

I've been on the Trump train for some time - but as a patriotic American, I shall be deliberately skeptical of what the God Emperor does while in office and hold him to account.  He's got a ticket to ride, but it's *our* train he's on.

Shitposting here, fighting against SJW's, trying to burn down this lazy-assed, insipid, mindless zeitgeist that's pervaded society in the last decade or so...those are all completely separate fights.
I want to make a simple point. It's a small red pill, but it's potent. MLK advocated equal opportunity. That's something many of us here believe in. Social Justice seeks equal outcomes...regardless of skill or effort. That...is communism.
Trumpington Coat Factory at your service.
Be an advocate instead of a social justice warrior.
Welcome, awoke centipede!

> The media takes everything he says literally

As the old saying goes:  

Media takes Trump literally, but not seriously; Trump supporters take him seriously, but not literally.
MSM and r/politics is Bizzaro Land...
Yeah so there's nothing good about being a SJW.  You can still care about social issues without employing their tactics of virtue signalling, slacktivism, ignorance, death threats, and bigotry.
They have no credibility especially after how wrong they got the election. They only care about money. 
They're not just biased, they're dangerous as fuck and they must be destroyed. 
Get this man a coat.
Conservatism in and of itself is egalitarian in nature as it lets us carve out our own destinies without having the government mandate anything 
"Believer in equal opportunity." That's the correct position.

The problem of Social Justice is when it assigns individuals to groups. It's actually a form of collectivism. The reality is, we're all just individuals. Groups are a mathematical construct our brains use to help make sense of something complex.

A wise man once said, "There is no such thing as a forest, there are only trees."
Welcome aboard! 

We hereby award you a coat, and the privileged title of Centipede.

Congratulations.

ctrl-left and the MsM are shameless liars.  We are tired of the lies.  We can have meaningful debate and disagreement, but not if one side is  lying.


spez: weclome! MAGA!
>They have no idea what they are talking about and they have no idea who trump is...he is a troll...a meaningful one, he is hilarious and connects with me more than I ever knew. 

There was an Atlantic article that mentioned the press takes Trump literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally. 

This always stood out to me on how we view him and how others do.

>believer in equal opportunity

Food for thought: Patrick Henry said "Give me liberty, or give me death," not "Give me equality, or give me death."

Equality is a sham, and when taken to it's logical conclusion, means all men will be brought down to the same level, since there are always those who cannot be raised. Liberty, [the right and power to act, believe, or express oneself in a manner of one's own choosing,](https://www.wordnik.com/words/liberty) might be what you *should* be arguing for instead.
Get this pede a coat!
They literally are that dumb in the MSM as you say. I read an article on the wappo that covered the Clinton/Trump jokes from their Catholic Dinner. The writer was confused on the meaning of the jokes, like logic had literally left his gene pool at birth.
welcome friend, here is a [weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme), prepare to repel brigaders! 
Social justice title attracts idiots. We prefer American. They don't believe in equality anyway. They believe in equity. Not equal opportunity, equal results no matter how much effort an individual puts in. 
I've always been with Trump. I never switched to his side form another candidate.
#lad
> believer in equal opportunity

The word you are working for is egalitarian, and that is what everyone here is.  Welcome aboard the Trump Train.  Warning, this train has no brakes.

Even as a Christian who doesn't like bad language... I'd give you all tHE coats I have plus more. 
I have met *virtually no-one* who doesn't believe in "equal opportunity" - except "vote for me, I'm a woman"
HERE HERE HERE TAKE MY COAT
Can I get a coat?
And T_D numbers keep rising. You can't stump the Trump!
We have a great coat for you!
Watching that clip on CNN and the host kept pressing on that burning the flag is legal. This is a twist on trumps statement as he said it shouldn't be legal, not that it was illegal. For contrast, you never see CNN press the point that guns are legal when the left says there should be gun control.
#The man needs a coat!
We are becoming more powerful than the globalists can possibly imagine.

They use "crisis actors" and insert these "fake news" stories in with the manipulated "real news" and we're never the wiser.

Seriously, look up "crisis actors", some have been caught in multiple "crisis 24/7 around the clock news commentary stories that are fed to the public.

This is amazing. Trump is the greatest man who ever lived.


#HIGH ENERGY
JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS! 
Step 1: convince my boss to let me off work. Step 2: drive 2500 miles (5000 round trip) to cincinnati ohio. Step 3: MAGA
Perfect, he gets to voice his opinions and concerns directly to the people one last time before taking office. This is perfect right now considering how the media is trying to undermine his legitimacy. Remind people why they voted for him.
Yay!  Evening entertainment!  I believe RSBN will live stream this.

I would try to go to Cincinnati, but my knees won't take the standing in line required.  I leave that to younger Centipedes,  but I will be there with you in spirit!
For every 'pede a cheese coney, and for every cheese coney a 'pede!

Get your hats off the racks pedes... thursday... we MAGA
Build the wall!!! Make it loud Ohio. This thank you tour is going to trigger SJW's bigly and spoil their holiday cheer. I love it!
Can we just have these for all eight years? Like, once every month or two, Trump should just visit a state's Capitol and hold a day long rally event. We'd call it Trumpapalooza. He could manage to visit all 50 states and maybe even a territory here and there, or an aircraft carrier on deployment. We would all show up early and tailgate. Maybe a local band or two could play a set. Then the President comes on stage and gives an epic pep talk for the American people. There would be fireworks and shit, people throwing giant beach balls around in the crowd, a yuengling in everyone's hand... He'd have to go back to Washington to do important president shit eventually, but we could stay partying into the night.



Ronald Reagan did these?
**M A D M A N**
Already getting ready for 2020. 
Yup, I predicted one of the places he'd do a rally was Cincinnati (West Chester to be exact).

Other great choices: Grand Rapids, Michigan, Dubuque, Iowa, Sarasota, Florida, Concord, North Carolina, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvnaia, Green Bay, Wisconsin, and a few others.
Cincinnati, you mean Harambes home city?

I really don't trust these loony liberals/elite globalists. 
As much as I love this I know I'm going to be furious watching the pinko libs outside of his speeches burning flags and wrecking the fucking place as liberals are known to do.
The savage warrior. Good news. Thanks.

***HOLY FUCKING SHIT, I'M LOOKING AT FLIGHTS, BITCHES!!!!***
I miss watching the rallies. I watched nearly all of them as they were airing live. Does anybody know if RSB will be streaming it? 
I wish Trump would keep his head low until after the electoral college votes on December 19. The anti-liberal "deadman's switch", i.e., Pence, is not active until after Trump/Pence win the electoral vote.
Thanks President Trump! Help Make:

Cincinnati 

New Orleans 

Birmingham 

St. Louis 

Detroit

Chicago

Cleveland 

Pittsburgh 

Buffalo

Rochester

Milwaukee 

Newark

Richmond

Baltimore

Kansas City 

And Philadelphia 

Great Again!
A literal "Thank you for winning" tour? Awesome! 
Damn these are going to be the most based of based rallies. Already won, and still rubbing it in the MSMs face by making them listen to him decimate them in front of thousands of fans.

Too much winning!
So jealous 
F yeah!!!  Back on the trail!
Are we gonna get a live stream? I have been relapsing 
Stay safe, Trump. Our country needs you 
I like this. No reason to stop the rallies. I want to celebrate with my people and I want to see Trump.
Great.
I was having Trump rally withdrawal.
I tried to get tickets and it says they will text me a code that could take up to 2 hours to receive. It's been 6 minutes and 34 seconds and still no code, freaking out help
So jealous of the Trump rally in Cincinnati. 
I really love how much Trump is driving engagement.  He's basically writing his own political playbook!
Just a warning to would-be Soros funded agitators who might think about rushing the stage:  he's the President Elect now.  The guys with Uzis are guarding him and they won't hesitate to unload on you.
...and of course, thousands of libs will be burning flags at these rallies, showing a clear distinction between them and patriotic MAGA folk.  Trump knows what he's doing folks.  

#NOT TIRED OF WINNING YET
Lol and no one here and Miami University will say anything about it. 

spez: spelling
The train never stops!
Their newspaper endorsed Clinton. Do not allow those rag reporters to interview him.
What is the purpose of these rallies though? He already won.
I'm off Thursday.  Kek be praised.
YES i miss Trump Rallies so much cant wait for Thursday
I plan on heading downtown to participate.  Should be a very good time. 
I went cold turkey on rallies and I'm in bad shape now. 21 days. 
Any chance for AZ getting one?
I am damn tempted to go to the pence rally in New Orleans,  then to Alabama to buy some yuengling. 

It's like a 9 hour drive to Bama though, hmm. 
Will RSBN be there to cover? I'll certainly watch!

SPEZ: Punctuation.
Mmmmmmmm I still haven't gotten tired of winning or tired of the liberal tears.
#FUCK YES 

SO GLAD THEY DECIDED TO DO THIS!!!
Ugh, as much as I'm happy, I fear a lot for his security...
Is this a good idea? I have a concern about his safety from exposing himself in public. 
I am literally thrilled that he's doing more rallies.

I DON'T CARE IF I EVER COME DOWN
#NO BRAKES!
[Yep](https://imgflip.com/i/1f159c)
I wish I could go. I live right outside of Cincinnati but I'm 2 hours away at university and finals are coming up. 
Can the liberals handle photos from 30 more YUGE events?
We need rallies so bad! 
Christmas came early this year.
Hope the guys who covered the rallies will be streaming these too.
Hillary couldn't even do rallies during the election. 
I hope to God that the Secret Service bring their A-game. 
When is PA!?!?!?  He's gotta come to Philly

Feels bad, man. 
#VIGILANT CONCERN  
  
we need to be on the lookout for anyone planning anti-trump protests at these events (MoveOn, craigslist) and we need to infiltrate these groups.
Mr. President-Elect, It's only been three weeks and I don't know if we can handle winning anymore. We're not use to it, we haven't won in decades...So I ask you, can we please stop winning Mr. President-Elect?
HERE WE GO FUCK YEA!
Has anyone gotten their verification numbers yet? I registered for tickets over two hours ago and haven't gotten them yet, I'm getting nervous that the arena is already sold out.
Im so excited. I didn't get to go to any Trump rallies during the campaign. Donald Jr came to my school but I had to leave before he gave his speech because I had class. This will be the first one I get to go to.
#PLEASE COME TO OKLAHOMA!!!
#BOI LEMME TELL YOU HOW HYPE I AM FOR THE RETURN OF THESE RALLIES

When election day drew closer, I was feeling a little sad because soon we'd get no more Trump rallies. I'm just so glad there are more rallies to come.
Really wish California wasn't so damn blue.  I really wanted to attend a campaign rally and would love even more to attend a victory rally, but Trump knows there's no point.  4 million of us Californians are very sad.
Oh my, the smugness will be of the charts. 
Pls come to California 
I am very happy about this as well. Not to concern troll. Will us assembling make it easier for them to try and enact martial law? I know, dumb question.
RALLIES ARE BACK?!?!?!?!
Maybe be will get #JusticeForHarambe
RSBN better get in gear and get there!  
Should do one near Chappaqua where Hitlery lives, just to troll her. You know tons of people will drive up there for it.
No breaks on the Trump Train. 
Colorado may have gone to Hillary, but it's a fluke Mr. God-Emperor!!! We blame Denver, Boulder, and Pueblo Co! The rest of us ain't so bad! lol
I wish it would say "Vice President elect Mike Pence" instead of governor Mike pence... NOT MY GOVERNOR 
I started this campaign with a trump rally in August of 2015. I will fucking end with a trump rally. 
Cant wait. 
Please be safe Mr Trump. We need you now more than ever
WIN WIN WIN 
**WOOOWOOOOOOWOOOOOO HES BACK BABY**
Got MINE!!!!!!!!!!! Will be the Second Time I see Mr. Trump but the first time I will see MY PRESIDENT ELECT!
OK so I am SERIOUSLY behind here. Have the recounts been done or not? Help me pedes, you're my only hope.
I hope he comes to Iowa 
Gonna get my high energy fix in again!  PLEASE COME TO TX.
Does this mean his cabinet picks will be done? Time to do other things now?
Please come to cucked CA or NV so I can see ya for 3rd time

Exciting, I really miss these.
Can someone please explain to me what the purpose of these rallies is?


How does this help push forward the policies trump said would make america great again?



I hope he gives Harambe a mention.
i dont know why but im scared for the guy every time he goes out to rallies 
#Time to start the 2020 campaign boys!
#DRAIN THE LOSING!
I don't like this, I hope they increased security ~~greatly~~ big league for this.
This is an awful idea IMO. We all know this will lead to clashing rallies which will inevitably lead to violence. Imagine the way the MSM will twist that in their favor, it fits perfectly into their narrative. 
Fuck yeah!  Get to see Mike on Saturday! 
Starting it off in my city! What an honor!

We need a list!!! Bc Im goinnnnngggg
I hope these get streamed.  I need my fix
I hope he comes to Cleveland in late December! I'll be there for Christmas. Would love to see the God-Emperor in the flesh!
He should invite LeBron

Lol head over to /r/Cincinnati for all the liberal tears your heart desires!! 
Still no verification code, been about 8 hours. Has anyone got one at all?
He's still doing rallies?  High Energy!
Stay safe Donald.
#Gonna party like it's January 20, 2017!
I am curious about the funding of these. 

Is he charging admission? I guess that would make sense.

Is he paying out of his pocket? What a guy!

Is he using left over political donations? Why not use that money to primary the cuck Republicans that wont back his agenda?

Looks like Trump is showing his true colors. Goldmansachs alum for Treasury sec...hahahahahahah
Who is she and what does she do?

Oh, I'd give her some love, if you know what I mean. 
Ive heard her speak, Frauke is genuinely all things bright and beautiful.
Oh for a man to honestly earn the respect and love of such a woman. To the point of a meeting of free equals, mind, body and spirit . This would quite literally be the cathartic actualisation of that epiphany so elusively hinted in the great art and songs of civilisation.
She OK, is what I'm saying.

Romney is going to be SOS. Save this comment. If you think Trump is going to publicly humiliate Romney after he invited him twice, you people don't know Trump. That is something Obama would do. Trump is way better than that.

I think Trump really wanted Romney badly. However, seeing the reaction from his base, he hesitated. He tried to go Petraeus but dude has too many scandals. Rudy is not fit for SOS position.

To understand Trump watch season 1 of the Apprentice. Troy Mclane was the most popular guy in the show. He fired him at number 4 and fired another guy who he saw as his son at number 5. He hired the guy who he thought was the best. He did the same thing in all seasons. He never let emotion get in the way of hiring. He always hired the best. 

He is hiring Romney because he thinks Romney is the most qualified for the job. Period. Recall Pence and the backlash he received - even Coulter called it a mistake by Trump back then. Now everyone's back pedalled on that. 

If you believe Trump will let Romney backstab him and not fire him instantly, again, you don't know Trump. He once fired a guy instantly because he used the term white trash. Trump does not tolerate mistakes or backstabbers.
Is Trump giving a Frank Underwood monologue? 
Lmao that waiter is salty af. Doesn't know he's about to bend the knee after he gets a tip from daddy

Kiss the ring Romney.
Romney is the establishment and he did not support us. How can he be rewarded with one of the top jobs? What message does that send? What swap is getting drained with him, Preibus and Ryan all sticking around?

# #NeverRomney
Who's on the left?  Preibus?

Hair swipe is on point. Notice the two have bowls and the other has a plate of bullshit.
How's it going?
#SPICEY
Its not you its me speech
I guess I always took "drain the swamp" to mean get rid of all the corrupt globalists that do things for money and favors.  They put themselves ahead of the American people.  Most of those are establishment people, but not all.  In my opinion, you can't just pick people that are all outsiders.  You need some (like Mike Pence) that know the system, can work with the existing people and can do the job the best.  I am not thrilled about Romney, but I am going to trust the God Emperor.  He got us here‚Ä¶I am not going to start doubting him now.
If Trump hires Romney, he thinks he's the best person for the job.

If he thinks he's the best person for the job, I haven't doubted Trump and I'm not going to start doubting Trump now even if I personally don't like Romney.

If Romney does a shit job, he's going to be fired without hesitation.  That's the beauty of a guy with the level of conviction Trump has.

Be careful! He might choke again!
Taking advantage of naive liberals has to be the most effective "get rich quick" scheme out there. Al Gore made so much from it that we don't even hear his name anymore, Sanders scored big, and now Stein.
"OUTRAGEOUS INCREASE"

#~~~Specially when Jill wanted a $22.5/hr federal minimum wage~~~ but doesn't want to put up with the $15/hr for the Wisconsin poll workers. HYPOCRITES

EDIT: Just checked. It was not Jill stein, it was Goofy Elizabeth Warren and she wanted $22 in 2013. Jill wants 15/hr.
She's lying to everyone who donated. Wisconsin never provided her an estimate. She made a guesstimate of the recount amount herself! She needs to shut the Fuck up. 
#\#JillsBeachHouse
MODS Sticky please!

At this rate, they'll have no money left for 'attorneys'.
Liberals, if you only learn one message this year, please let it be this: NO REFUNDS, KIDS.
Hahaha Wisconsin is based.  You want to waste everyone's time?  Price just tripled.  And no hand recount.
RED ALERT: DONATE MORE MONEY TO JILL STEIN NOW!!

NO TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT. THEY NEED THE MONEY TODAY.

THIS IS LITERALLY THE ONLY CHANCE TO STOP THE RUSSIAN COUP.
"An outrageous increase"?  

:)   A scammer complaining about being scammed is priceless.
Thanks for the smile, One-Toke-Over-The-Line-Stein!
Whoever in Wisconsin did that is a total boss. Jill Stein is raking in the cash taking advantage of emotional liberals and next thing you know Wisconsin triples their estimate. 

Get rekt m8
Lol Based Wisconsin is trolling her! 
~~I hear the beach house next to to Bernie's just went on the market.~~ WI increased their recount price. SEND MOAR MONIES! 
You can't make this shit up folks
According to ABC, she still hasn't paid the money as of an hour ago.  She has until 4:30 this afternoon.  But Fox mentioned the recount has started, so I'm not sure what's going on.  Did she pay them yet or not?
She's gonna need about tree fiddy (million)...
$1.1M was HER estimate, not the estimate of those who actually fucking do the recount.  Fucking FRAUD HACK PUPPET!!
I knew they were going to stiff the fuck out of her. 
It's called inflation Jill. It happens when cucks raise the minimum wage for people that have zero job skills, but can be taught to stuff ballot boxes. 
I really should set up a political party. There seems to be a lot of idiots willing to throw money at you even if it is utterly obvious you are just peddling snake oil. 
The little commie loves dat monez yo
I should try this at work.  "Hey, that new music software I wanted, it's not $300, it's actually $6,000" and buy tons of shit I'll barely ever use.
What a standard cunt.  Her own party has split with her on the recount.  She better take the money and run, because that's all she'll have left at the end.
This woman is something else, and it's sad that there are people donating to this cause. If you really want to make a difference in this country quit your bullshit and go donate to the homeless, less fortunate, other countries...etc. Not your fucked liberal agenda so you can continue to deteriorate.  
 #NoRefunds2016 needs to start trending on twitter
Ohhhh Noooooooo!!!!

That sucks...
Wow all those red counties aren't being cooperative, huh? 


fuckin idiot
Wisconsin is a small state too.  PA is going to want 15
Wisconsin overstates the cost of a recount to Jill Stein. Jill Stein overstates the cost of a recount to her liberal donors.

Wisconsin uses extra money on infrastructure and manufacturing. This helps Trump win the state again in 2020.

Jill Stein uses extra money on 2020 campaign to split the left. This helps Trump win by bigger margins in 2020.

Poor gullible liberals throwing their money away to help Trump get reelected in 2020. I'd feel bad for them if they weren't currently trying to overthrow the democratic process like sore losers.
Imagine if that money could have went to the Red Cross to help those sitting outside cold and homeless in Tennessee.
I hope they raise it again and just keep collecting money form these suckers.
Translation: Send mor munny, kthxbai.
About another 60 minutes before the payment deadline hits.  How's the  bake sale going?

I'll use, "Who wants a recount?" (tune:Who Let the Dogs Out) for advertisements.
lol @ liberals being mad that a government-run operation went over budget. WOW SURPRISED
Jill said the average "donation" (private coffer filler) is $45.00. Do the math. Wow. I can see why over 900 people died by following Jim Jones. Exploiting the mentally incapacitated.
This looks awfully a lot like No Man's Sky.
What, or who, does she say is "outrageous?" She made the estimate herself without checking with Wisconsin. Now that she asks them and gets a figure three times her estimate, they become "outrageous?"
No refunds
*In fine print under the period*
"No refunds lol"
I instead decided to cram money in my anus, drink benzine and light the ensuing fecal matter ablaze
Get a job you goddamn hippie.
I can't believe Wisconsin is ripping off her scam! /s
Can someone please explain the purpose of recounting Wisconsin? Even if it flips to Hillary, Trump wins.
She gon need about tree fitty million 
She's brilliant.  You might say this is an obvious money grab.  You might say she's not brilliant because it is so easy to do.  You might say it's not fair to prey on the emotionally unstable.

I say, take them for everything they're worth.  I hope you use it to buy a nice American built house, or fund your own children's TV show on PBS.
but didn't she raise like 5 million?
And the cuck lawyer will charge $8 million.
I fell for this once with Bernie.
We could use the money to win on trade, to win at the border, to get rid of isis... What a waste 
We could use the money to win on trade, to win at the border, to get rid of isis... What a waste 
is this even legal? 
What does this effectively mean? What are the consequences?
God, we really can't stop winning.
i'd raise it up to exactly the amount she raised....play ball plant bitch.

Also they are probably raising it because she wants a HAND recount and they said no.
**KEK**
hahaha I love this!
Lol wtf is going on?? Are we living in a fucking meme?!!
Al Gore is riding his bicycle to Wisconsin right now to help out
@georgesoros?
Oh no, she was expecting to have far more money to embezzle after this farce was complete.  Poor Jill.

I guess she didn't have much luck in Vegas, needs a second try at the roulette table.

Seeing as how ridiculous the whole thing is, I'd hope Wisconsin asks whatever price they damn well please. It's not going to change anything, so why would they want to bother with the effort for Jill Stein's political gain?

Just use the "leftover" money going to the green party : ^ )
that's why it's called an ESTIMATE you whacked out old druggie
Deadline for payment was Friday. It's not a legal contest anymore 
ohhh nooo, thats to bad

Good. Let's make the left broke.
Are they paying with their EBT cards?
She's just another piece of shit political extortion artist. Fuck off plant lady.
any updates on court / Deadline? Did She write the check? Did the judge tell her to BTFO? 
who is even stupid enough to throw away money like that. you got 2 million, im sure a lot of homeless folks could use some of that even if just to get more locker services for em for a few thousand $s.
Lmao this bitch knows what's up i am officially running for president next year, need the cash
#OLE CLICK BAIT JILL STRIKES AGAIN 
I hope there is a Legal Authority watching this. Just like asking for money for a recount in PA that has already passed. And still calling for money **under the guise' of a PA recount when it is no longer a recount but a 'contest'. (PERJURY.). A Contest needs 'evidence' not speculation in order, to even, be considered. (A Prima Facie case.).
A fool and their money are easily parted.
Yeah, it's really outrageous that we need to pay the people actually doing the recount. Outrageous. Guess worker rights go out the window when Soros takes over.

Oh, she is good.

She is very good. 
Bwhahahahah she thought she'd have to drop only 20% of her nest egg and leave the rest for the war chest.  MI calls her bluff. 
I demand a recount in my state give me money plz
Hopefully she is charged with Soros under rico
Just like EVERY idea from the lunatic left, the actual cost is always 3x what they tell you it will be.
All I see is a player playing the game. She's doing her best to round up money for the next election. Hilary is done for, but Jill hasn't even gotten a chance. Also, she loves to pander. If she's not dead, or shamed out of politics, she'll be a threat to Trump getting his second term. 

She's dangerous.
Isn't there a famous quote about separating a fool from his money?
She'll be asking for an additional $10 million tomorrow 
It's adjusted for inflation and a shill tax

WELCOME ABOARD! NO BRAKES!!

GET THIS PATRIOT A COAT!!
Yeah they don't get it.  Look at it this way, the left is a bunch of spoiled children and the right is the father.  The country and the people in it know the difference between right and wrong.  The little children don't want daddy to govern because he CAN be mean(notice I wrote CAN, not IS).  They don't like to be told NO.  They always want what they want, right or wrong.  They want their way even when it makes no sense and is even detrimental to them.

It's cyclical, daddy's in charge again and he will be firm and fair even though the spoiled little brats THINK he's mean.  
33% Of Counties That Voted Obama **Twice** Flipped To Trump
-

Just throwing that out there. 
Same thing here buddy! I'm not religious, I voted for Obama twice, I'm white but my girlfriend of years and years was Mexican, we live in California. I speak more Spanish than many of my "brown" friends. I've been involved in so many Mexican events and celebrations because of her, went to Mexico with her, etc. 

The left got really weird in the last few years and suddenly I became public enemy number one. I must be racist and sexist and hate Mexicans. What's interesting is that even legal Mexicans don't like illegal Mexican immigrants. They can differentiate between someone being "racist" and someone who wants to address illegal immigration. I love how the left makes it out that everyone who is Mexican must be pro illegal immigration just because of their skin color... üôÑ
I am a based hispanic in NH... truly shocked he didn't win up here.. too bad Jill Stein didn't ask for a recount.
Forgot to include the left assuming I'm an uneducated hillbilly from the south. That's always a good one.
Man of faith here. Glad to have you on board this train with NO BRAKES!!
Welcome!
Hispatheist! Thank you for helping make America great again!
I live in an extremely Hispanic dominated county. I've been told by more than one of them that they prefer Mexican because that is where their families came from. I think I might be a minority here, if not then it is real close. Maybe its just my neighborhood? This county voted overwhelmingly for Trump. 68%. Johnson also did well here pulling in 9.7% of the vote. 

There are a whole lot more based Hispanics out there than the media wants to admit. Quite honestly I have a hard time understanding why Hispanics, with their strong catholic beliefs, still vote democrat. It us like they are voting against their own self interest.

You are definitely not alone. 


SPEZ: looks like my numbers were a bit wrong. Looked it up and the demographics are 42.5% Hispanic and 53% non-hispanic. The remainder is split between other races. Overall a pretty Hispanic dominated county compared to national numbers.
#BASED!

White Apache Helicopter here who voted Obama twice and voted for Hilldawg in the primary only to switch to Trump.  The left has lost it's mind and gone full 1984 and became even worse than the neocons.  Fuck em both.  Reregistered NPP and will vote for only common sense candidates going forward.  No more blind party allegiance.

We need to get this man a coat!
I'm 1st generation Mexican-American, gay, and an atheist. I voted for Obama in '08, but cast my ballot for Trump in '16. Being from Los Angeles, I was bombarded with left-wing ideology that was never followed up with a explanation or justification that made any sense to me. I decided to play the role of the "good" American and did what I consider a civil duty: I did my research. In peeling back the layers of Clinton/Obama/DNC, I came to the realization that these people don't want to help me, they want to keep me on a short leash, one tied to dying stump. On the other hand, looking at Trump/RNC made far more sense to me. I was hearing talk of policy, inclusiveness to those who share our common good, looking BEYOND the color of your skin, and DEALING with the facts at home and abroad. Clinton losing is a sour pill to swallow but it happened, and we must move on.

Now it would be undemocratic of myself to not call a spade for a spade. Mr. Trump has made off-color remarks in his past but I can look beyond that. What he said were words, as far as I'm concerned he hasn't acted upon them. Now Clinton, well, what hasn't been said, and PROVEN, of her and her husband? When I saw the list of pros and cons of each candidate, AFTER doing my research, Trump was far more the leader we need in these beautiful United States of America. Clinton would have merely been a face for private interests, not the American people, therefore continuing Obama & the Democratic party's false narrative of togetherness.

It is time for us to put one foot in front of the other. My fellow conservatives, liberals (yes, you too!), alt-right, and those who wished to not be labeled: the road to knowledge is not a straight line; it curves, 
and bends,
and swoops, 
and sometimes you fall. 

But throughout the struggle and dizzying nature of the TRUTH, we have gained the strength to stand proud with our fellow countrymen and say simply, very simply, with hope, "good morning."

Note: I took that last bit out of Maya Angelou's Inauguration poem for Bill Clinton. I wish to elaborate on the theme of said poem as a critique of the Democratic party's affiliation with the anti-black suffrage movement at a later time. Thank you!

SWEET JESUS! I taught I was the only Hispanic atheist that voted for trump! (millennial too) 
She has like 1% chance of winning ?
Brexit wont happen, Donald Trump wont be President, Marine le Pen wont be France'S next President, Frauke Petry have no chance in Germany.

You know what MSM? Fuck you!
Oh shit its heating up! Next step is "is this the beginning of the of Le Pen's campaign?"
You know why all these elites are confused? They're on the wrong side of history, literally.

I don't know enough about french politics to have a solid opinion, but I sure as hell wouldn't trust the EU elite on informing me.
I know everyone wants to say Oh but Brexxit oh but Trump.

Le Pen is a different situation. 

Le Pen is actually polling like 30 points behind in the election campaign and if the conservative guy is picked to run against her, she won't have much of a base to pull from in terms of people with anti-muslim sentiments, etc as I think it's Juppe? is already somewhat on board with that stuff.

Unlike Le Pen, Trump has a considerable polling advantage going into the primaries and both him and leave were polling a few points down on the day of the vote. 

I've researched this pretty in depth, I don't see any actual way Le Pen could win the election, in fact, Sanders had a better chance at winning the GE than she does, and especially because she's been around for a long time and is running in place of her father who was also around for a while its not like she's some insurgent who's come out of nowhere.

This is somewhat like expecting Gary Johnson to magically have a path to victory even though he's never really gone places or made much of a splash even under the most favourable conditions.

She has a lot of ground to make up, its not impossible but to my knowledge she completely lacks the funding and by a huge amount as well to even get a considerable enough ground game going that could push her polling up by any more than say 10 points. 
O√π est le message board "reddit/The_LePen"?
is it just me that thinks its a huge conflict of interest to support one candidate more than the other? the should let the countries decide who they want and then build relations. god damn could you get a cuckyer cuck that has ever cucked?
Says the president who didn't have to win an election to become president.
Whether it's Le Pen or Fillon or Juppe - France needs to unfuck this burgeoning crisis they face or they'll fall.  

Perhaps they're at the tipping point now culturally and ethnically...[Calais wasn't a shining moment in successful assimilation and French generosity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=382njADcWvE)  

Ally or not...I'm sorry, but if their self-imposed, *voluntary* domestic policies and ethos prove to be as destructive as I envision...don't expect me to throw on a Kevlar helmet and come help.  

They've been utterly feckless, they've tried to push their problems on to nations like the UK, and aside from the effects...they've tried to play it up as some kind of virtuous thing to do.

Well, that's a failed government to me - when you won't take effective action to defend and protect your populace from an invasion - what the hell use are you?

The French oughta drag out another guillotine and start burning their politicians out of their homes, IMO.  They're getting one hell of an unfair shake.

As to Juncker...why, *why* ***why*** hasn't the EU shitcanned him, or its participatory countries held an en masse (heh!) referendum to rebuild their tenuous union into something a little more equitable for everyone?

He sounds like a snake-tongued dictator and the overarching actions of the EU...every time I read about them...seem like they're generally worse for the civilians under their auspices than individual deals or no deals at all would be.

Frankly, and to summarize - gotta cook dinner - y'all is some *dumb* muhfuckas takin' it up in yo booties.

Some regime where you have to rely on the US for military defense and an oppressive regime to ostensibly keep all you "enlightened, forward-thinking" folk from going back to the internecine shooting wars that plagued your continent for centuries.
What can a lowly 'pede, like me, do to help Madam Le Pen?

The clock boy thing just might be my biggest gripe against him. It personifies his whole presidency, bad judgement. Giving bad guys credit because they fit a narrative
Obama will honor ANYTHING having to do with Islam and will continue to legitimize terror attacks in the name of Jihad. 
Anybody notice that /r/the_Donald posts aren't hitting your frontpage? I call fuckery
#**NICE MADCHETTE THERE MOHAMMED, WANNA BRING IT TO THE CUCKSHED??**
Praise a police officer? With a gun? In a red state? Who shot a Muslim terrorist?

Are you kidding me? 
King Cuck is just trying to run out the clock on his presidency. Besides, he's a Muslim sympathizer and it would ruin the narrative (which already has been crushed, but whatever...)
I'd rather get a call from Donald Trump than a medal and parade from Barack. 
kind of funny, that after the kid and his family went to the WH to meet Yobammy, they decided to leave the country.
As a former cop, fuck you Obama. 
Goodbye Obongo! You won't be missed.

#ififififif
You've got your fucking priorities all wrong, Barack "The Cuck" Obama.
He's waiting to see if somehow the LEO violated the rights of a poor, innocent, Muslim boy who was just looking for a place to pray.

January 20th....
The whole clock boy thing was a scheme by the parents to scam money out of people.

1. Purposely "make" a clock that looks like a bomb
2. Get the kid inspected for it, anything else would be gross negligence
3. Get outraged when it's "found out" that it was "only a clock"
4. Sue for discrimination/whatever

The parents of that kid should be charged for deceit.
https://i.sli.mg/Us1muU.jpg

More like a boy who took apart a clock and put it in a briefcase to resemble a bomb...
Obama wouldn't recognize a hero even if said hero was kicking his ass out of the white house on January 20th
Worst President. 
The Divider in Chief hates America , he always has. Go back and watch and some sermons from Jeremiah Wright of the " I Hate America" church he attended for 20 years.
This is exactly what the Worst President in History would do.  
"Cool Machete, Abdul. Want to bring it to the White House?"
He's too busy giving "Freedom Awards" to ball players and talk show hosts. **Obama, you're fired!**
Cool machete Ali want to bring it to class? 
He knows his base, that's for sure.
Barry will always be a disgrace. 
What a national embarrassment.  I hope when Trump starts his term he will scrub every tweet from the @POTUS account, and then proceed to continue business as usual with @realDonaldTrump.
Obama only recognizes black people.
NOT MY PRESIDENT!
It's also worth mentioning the front page of CNN (or Reddit for that matter) makes no reference to the Ohio State attack, yet features a Dylan Roof article as a headline. 
He's such a fucking disgrace. It feels impossible now, at the end of his presidency, that we actually made it thru 8 years of this asshole. How the fuck did we manage this for  EIGHT FUCKING YEARS?!
Is that fake clock boy that race baited so his family can sue as they hide in Qatar still in Qatar and trying to falsely sue the school. Fuck that kid. Obama and the liberals got hoodwinked and they have the audacity to double down
Obama is a joke, #notmypresident!
Cool COCK, Ahmed, Want to bring it to the white houses and meet podesta for an hour of cheese pizza.

sorry couldn't help myself.....just like podesta's ilk ; P
#NotMyPresident
Not a Donald supporter, but I totally agree this is shitty. The clock thing still pisses me off to this day. Now anytime an American has legitimately done something great, he'll look like a fool for not recognizing it.
Come solder my cpu please.
Because Islam.
First order of business day 1 of Trump Presidency, give the OSU officer an award at the White House. Get the Presidency off on the right foot with #FakeNews and see how they spin it. 
**"Cool Machete you got there AKHMED ...want to bring it the White House?"**
The officer shot a jihadist, the real hero for Barry, not the brave officer. Maybe Obama will weep and wimper 'if I had a son, he would look like Abdul.'
He didn't really buy a clock online. He took a regular old shitty digital clock, made it look like a bomb for a prank, then went along with every that was saying he was a victim. His whole family is in trouble because of it because they do this kind of thing all the time apparently. IRC they may even have left the country to avoid prosecution because they tried to sue the school over it which caused an investigation showing that the whole thing was a prank. That kid's father is a serious cunt too by the way. 
the terrorist was the hero in obamas eyes, obama loves a bit of jihad.
#COOL MACHETE, ABDUL. WANNA BRING IT TO THE WHITE HOUSE? WE SHOULD INVITE MORE INNOCENT REFUGEES LIKE YOU TO BECOME DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS. IT'S WHAT MAKES MY LEGACY GREAT.
he's not the president, he's the guy in the way of the president
Those replies make me sick acting as if he actually did anything good for the country
Come on guys Obama is just made no white people were killed.
Eating Hot Dogs can make a man forgetful. Plz forgive him.
I really don't like Obama. He's such a panzy ass
 #NotMyPresident
PATHETIC! Leader of the MUSLIM world!
This is why they lost, and will continue to lose.
Reminder: If he had a son it wouldn't look like the cop that shot the terrorist. That's why. We all *know* why. Let's just be honest here. 
When DJT takes office he should celebrate the officer's actions. It wouldn't be a direct dis to obama but it would definitely be implied.
    he probably thinks the police acted foolishly and if he had a son he'd look like Abdul Razak Ali Artan.
If it happened to be a white anti-government terrorist like Timothy McVeigh stopped by a Muslim person of color there would be an Obama sponsored ticker tape parade in New York city followed by 3 full days of glowing CNN coverage and an honorary gala dinner at the White House.
Wrong color for the racist in chief.
No worries we will have a real president in less than 2 months! 
He will acknowledge rappers and movie stars but not actually true heroes. If you look at the background of the people that he's giving credit too, they have all donated to campaign when he ran for presidency. 
He also said if he had a son then Trayvon would look like him, but nobody in his cabinet had ever heard of Christopher Lane.
Malik's brother is traitor in chief.
Most unamerican president ever
Obama is a real POS and I'm pretty upset that it took me until this election to see it
LITERALLY THE WORST PRESIDENT EVER
Guys just a white dude doing his job as far as Barry BobAMA is concerned. Nothing special, nothing to acknowledge.

Now if a Muslim had somehow stopped a school shooting, and the shooter was a white dude....Barry would be all over that.
That man deserves a medal
I never knew this was real life....
He's busy mourning the loss of a fellow muslim brotherhood member
Oh what this is a real tweet. I thought it was a pol meme. 
I would not doubt that Obama likes terrorist attacks on our soil.
Yeah but that guy was more important because he was a MUSLIM, and this guy is just a FUCKING WHITE MALE 
51 more days.
yet another reason the left lost.  Fuck off with the muslim terrorists.  get them out of here.
I honestly think that Saudi Arabia and/or other Muslim nations must be holding something over Obama's head for him to act the way he does.
#HE SHOT OBAMA'S SON.
He's fucking pathetic. 
spineless puppet.
Was the cop a Muslim?  No. Did he shoot a fucking white male? No. Then he doesn't get to meet the president!!!! Use some damn logic here people!!!
If the cops name was Mohammad he would have been invited to white house.
liberals, destroyers of nations...  
  
spez:missed a letter
You talking about that little Muslim fucker who was trying to cause trouble in school who made a device that looked more like a bomb than a clock? Yeah, Obama the Muslim sympathizer. Sorry Obozo, there's a new President in town. No more pandering to filth. 
Obama is mad because his fellow islamics fell
he is sad he couldnt invite the Somalian to the White House, show some compassion, you bastards
Ahmed's Dad - Now where did I put that pencil box I was going to use for building my bomb??  That fucking kid needs to stay out of my supplies!!!
just when you thought Obama's T couldn't get any lower!
Leave this poor communist alone! 
Believe me, we Buckeyes are very thankful for Officer Alan. He deserves to be recognized by Obama for his quick and appropriate response. One of my friends knew some of the people injured in the attack.
Not my president (soon).
Barack Obama doesn't care about blue people.
Well the kid was actually trying to make a bomb and blow his school up.
And funny thing was the clock thing was a hoax. This was real.
I made a MacGyver like thing like clock boy when I was in school and got suspended even though it wasn't dangerous. My dad hit the fucking roof, slapped the shit out of me, and I never did it again. Became an engineer though. This kid got invited to the White House by the POTUS. SAD!
His fellow terrorist failed the mission. 
Obozo is a pedophile

It would call attention to his failed policies, and we all know how concerned he is with preserving his legacy.
Ever see the Keane and Peele about Obama not wanting to hug white folks? 
I had no idea that was an actual tweet! Hahaha! Sad indeed! This makes the meme even more hilarious.
Typical!!
**SAD!!**
I'm out of the loop what does the guy buying a clock refer to?
The clock was counting down!
You can bet your ass Trump will be honoring this cop during his first year in office.  
He didn't even build the fucking clock. He just took one out of the case and **put it in a briefcase**

[He did make mention of it though.](https://imgur.com/a/iMSGU)
Did the kid buy the main clock part online and make the bomb-looking-housing himself, or was the whole thing bought online?
This would be a great time to highlight the difference between good and bad immigration! Horujko and Artan are not Mayflower Pilgrim names. But one of them is a hero and one a terrorist. Extreme vetting is the least we can do to bring more heroes and fewer terrorists!!
perhaps if the hero had a little bit more melanin.

> Obama will recognize a boy who bought a clock online but won't recognize the hero who saved lives at OSU yesterday?


that's cause he's not from hollywood and he's not a muslim
Would it kill him to say to this hero, "Cool shot, Horujko; Want to come to the White House?"
He is a Muslim sympathizer. Always will be. Ask his SS why his dogs don't fly on the same plane. Really?! Ask!
So if the DOJ uncovers evidence that this faggot is the traitor scumbag that we know that he is, is he immune from prosecution?
Osama ben biden get out already #please 
He's a fucking bigot that's why!!

This CIA plant is so easily a bought shill.

The only thing on his brain are dicks and communist propaganda.
hes a piece of shit. what did you expect.
obama was in favor of the terrorist. deep down inside he honestly believed that the terror attack happened because of anti-muslim bigotry. hes about to leave office soon and become a black community figure. be prepared to hear from Obama the things he kept inside him for 8 years in office.
Obviously this cop [acted stupidly](http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/07/22/harvard.gates.interview/).

So is Ahmed's clock really the timer for a bomb to blow up with?
I already challenged some idiot to a fist fight today, saying he was happy about the Tennessee fires and hoping it was destroying lives of Trump supporters as well as wishing the whole state was burning. So I might as well challenge this idiot as well. I personally challenge to a nationally televised fist fight in which I will triumph over your candy ass and hopefully beat the delusion out of you. 
Well you know them Muslims must stick together

Now if only something could he done about Rosie spreading these lies about a 10 year old child.  NASTY WOMAN
That was a shitty apology. Didn't even show his face.

He should have had to make a verbal apology and people should be able to see his shame. He accused a 10 year old of being autistic based on a video of him taken at 3:30 in the morning.
was that one of our weaponized autists baiting the left again??
If he really is an autist like some of us are, then picking on him is an enormously stupid idea. A smart kid with a computer can fuck with your life in ridiculous ways. Remember the hacker movies? Just sayin. 
There's nothing wrong with having Autism but it makes me angry that they are trying to use autism as a negative label it's demeaning to all of us that have it. Baron was probably just tired it was like 3a.m. when Trump gave his speech. Fuck those cucks trying to use autism as an insult.
TIL Barron isn't autistic.
What exactly gives the libtards the impression that Barron is autistic? 
Good for her and Barron. Shame on Rosie for trying to concern a troll the internet with it over twitter.
It's like when he went all sjw on this SJW warrior parents that scream and yell autistically about shoes and BLM retards now.

Attagirl
Everyone knows it was complete bullshit! My kids would have looked brain damaged with the faces they would have made!!! 
Do not anger Slovenia Mama Bear
Rosie is pathetic and should be ashamed of herself.

Going after a kid like that is disgusting.
Also, it honestly is comical how someone believes that they can diagnose autism in a young kid via several short video clips. Not to mention, having zero experience in the medical field. 
A channel with only 4k subs? lol. Wonder what it was before.
I wish I could slay as hard as barron. Damn my meager non God emperor genes.
Go after Correct the Record, Mrs Trump, please!
Comments section gave me herpeghonasyphilaids.
I saw the video and apparently the author is a 12 year old kid. The kid wrote that he was scared shitless because he was contacted by Melania's lawyer to take down the video and post a retraction/apology or face a lawsuit. He was terrified lol.
not really a win, folks.

i saw the entire video before all of this blew up and it was a 100% ***anti***-bullying video. it even had "stopthebullying" as a hashtag in the title, for christ's sake. the uploader showed clips from other youtube channels that actually *were* bullying him and proceeded to explain that his mannerisms showed possible signs of autism with example videos from the election night and the fact that having a child as late in his age as trump did can significantly increase the chances of autism.  a lot of the comments were from people who were either autistic or had autistic family members that agreed that the kid was definitely showing signs that they'd witnessed from others with autism. i definitely don't agree with the kneejerk reaction that this uploader received when it was all done in good intentions.

edit: you can circlejerk all you want with the downvotes, anyone who didn't actually watch the video is irrelevant here. the uploader wasn't being a bully in that video and that's a fact. all of you idiots relying on hearsay instead of actually knowing what the video contained are the real bullies here. that youtuber does not deserve this hivemind backlash at all.
Do we have an opinion on whether he is autistic or not? Love him either way its just weird that this is a thing. Nothing to be ashamed of but seems it could be easily quashed. 
free speech?

It's great.  
  
 - They'll burn more flags, losing patriotic voters.  
  
 - They'll look like dicks because Hilllary sponsored a bill to protect flags.  
  
 - They'll in-fight about it and experience cognitive dissonance when they read that the confederate flag is free speech too.  
  
 - It'll consume a news & social media cycle while Trump makes appointments and other moves which are infinitely more important to how government will be run.  
  
 - It cost Trump a tweet (cost = $0).  For that price, his name and impending Presidency will be spoken about a few million extra times today.  
  
 - Trump once again aligns himself with patriots, real Americans, people who love America, veterans and law enforcement who honor the flag, and good decent people.  The media & Dems align themselves with the  clueless raging scum who burn flags.  Trump is reinforcing not just his own brand, but America's and the GOP too, while hurting the dishonest media and hyperpartisan Democrats.  
And now they'll be doing flag burning en masse. Just in time for his victory tour.   

If they didn't deserve it so, I'd feel sorry for them being so stupid.  


r/[redacted] lost their fucking shit overt this, was a beautiful thing to see.
FUCK /u/spez
There's another trap for liberals in this topic because they've suddenly become fierce protectors of freedom of speech / expression and the 1st amendment thanks to it, having forgotten that they normally push for various hate-speech limitations or laws. 

They cannot do both at the same time (actually they can, but it will look really stupid).

This tweet came completely out of nowhere.  If the MSM had any smarts at all, they'd research this a bit first.  At the very least, you'd think they would suspect possible trolling by now.  Instead, they keep showing their "TRUMP IS EVIL AND MUST BE SHUT DOWN" reactionary instincts and true colors.  Stupid is as stupid does. 
The Media is bringing their best, and still getting BTFO.

And to think this could all be avoided if the MSM actually INVESTIGATED claims before stupidly shouting out the first thing that comes to mind.

just going to point out to my fellow pedes, a flag you can't burn isn't worth saluting.

Nice info but illrelevant. Donald won not Hillary, and currently he's the one in the position to make this a reality.

You guys do realize the election is over, can we move on now?
Burning the flag is a type of speech though, you can't ban that. Burning a flag is one of the most patriotic things you can do. 

 This isn't a "I hate America burn the flag" post. I just believe in less intrusive government and making it illegal to burn the flag is the opposite of that. 
Funny as if we're still competing against Hillary like she is a threat to the Whitehouse....
I know that he is trolling, but I really wish that he would propose some laws that can put these leftist scum in prison. I don't want to get even, I don't want to get along, I want these fuckers to pay.
My personal thoughts on 'flag burning' in the US...

From the way I see it, the flag of the United States of America, the Star Spangled Banner, is the symbolic representation of the Nation and it's constitution. So if one was to burn the flag one may as well have, symbolically, burned the Constitution, the First Amendment and the Nation itself. For these things are essential to one another's existence. There would be no constitution without the nation and it's heritage. Thus the question is; does the First Amendment protect the symbolic expression that the Nation, the Constitution and the First Amendment should be destroyed? Yet regardless of what you think it's actually a moot point. For how can one advocate that something should exist so that it shouldn't exist? How can one say "I need freedom of speech to protest freedom of speech"? For in burning the flag they are burning everything it represents including the constitutional right to freedom of speech.

But perhaps I'm mistaken... Thoughts?
Hillary is not President-Elect
... Was I the only one who thought something completely different when I saw TrumpsTraps?

It was wrong then, and it's wrong now.

It's actually smart that he is using that tactic against then. The media won't give him credit when he does something positive and then slammed him when he repeats something that the person they fawn over proposed in the past. 
It was wrong to propose in 2005, and it's wrong to propose it in 2016.

I can't agree with Trump on this. 
Burning the American flag is, and should continue to be a right.   

Also. You are a fucking dick if you do it.
Your autism is misplaced, the election is over. Stop bringing up Clinton, Trump should no longer be compared to her. He's president now. Let Clinton slide into irrelevance and make Trump accountable for his own statements.
#64-D SUPER MARIO BROS: THE LOST LEVELS 
It's interesting to see people still pointing to something Hillary said as if she's relevant. Or as if everyone who disagrees with something Trump said automatically agrees with something Hillary said.

Hillary isn't going to be president. Trump is, and the fact of the matter is that burning the flag is protected under freedom of speech, so his opinion that people should be punished for freedom of speech is worrying. Do you support the thought that people should be punished for exercising freedom of speech that you dissagree with? Because even if Hillary got elected, I would hope that both Trump *and* Hillary supporters would be against this if Hillary had then come out and said it after being elected.

Trump's going to be one of the most powerful people on the planet; what he says stands on it's own merits, and pretending like pointing to something someone irrelevant said is a defense of his views is actually stupid.
I'm as big a Trump fan as anyone, but I kinda wish he would quit trolling like this. We have a very divided country right now. You've got maybe 15-20% of the population that are literally scared of the guy, and another 30-40% that are skeptical but at least willing to give him a chance to work. A tweet like this accomplishes nothing except provide a little entertainment for his supporters, but to everyone else it probably reinforces the stereotype that he's not serious, doesn't have the temperament, is unfit, etc. 

I think at a time like this he really needs to focus on unifying the country and trying to help out the people who are concerned about his Presidency. I don't know, am I making too big of a deal out of this?
Am I the only one who doesn't care if it was proposed by Clinton? It was against the first amendment then just like it is now. The election is over, Clinton isn't a factor in anything anymore.
This is why I come here. This right here.

- Trump isn't stupid. He has played the MSM since day 1 and right now they are struggling to understand, and they keep on falling for it.

- The left are hypocrites (FACT). There are so many examples of this.

This is the closest relationship we the people have ever had with a president. Trump sets them up, we blast them when they show their ass. Between us Centipedes and the God Emperor, America will wake up.
Don't you guys always complain that Hillary is the devil? But now you're gladly comparing Trump to Hillary as if it's a good thing.

The lack of self awareness here is incredible.
This is not a "trump trap!" Stop fooling yourselves! He didn't just say it to catch Hillary in a lie. The race is over. He said it because he means it. They are both wrong about this. If you disagree with him, dont pretend it was a trap for Hillary. It wasn't. Just imagine the hijinks this country could get into if you, his base, never questions him even when you disagree with him. 
ok but what does this accomplish?  The race against Hillary is over.  What is the madman up to?
Hillary's [proposed law](https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/1911/text) was all about the **intent** of flag burning and destroying. Trump is going several levels deeper than anyone has mentioned. 
You idiots realize that Hillary isn't running anymore right?
But...not everyone who opposes this or even who opposes Trump supports or supported Hillary. I'd say a large chunk of Clinton votes were a lot more to do with being anti-Trump than they were to do with being pro-Hillary. Despite how ghastly a woman she is, many saw her as the lesser of two evils.

I think these Trump policy remarks need to be looked at in isolation as a presidential policy rather than an election promise or something to be held up to as a standard barer against an opposing view point. This is real life now. This isn't a game versus Hillary or leftists or liberals any more.

I do however think it's a gross overestimation of Trumps cunning if you think there is any premeditation or "traps" involved in his remarks. Like I said, there's no election any more. There's nobody to trap. There is no game or competition any more. This is real life now.
so theyre both wrong, whats your point?
Hillary isn't president, though.  What does this have to do with the president-elect advocating going against the first amendment?
Although no one seems to care, let's be clear that the bill introduced by Clinton and Bennett **DOES NOT OUTLAW** the burning of a person's own American flag for the purpose of political statement.

*Maybe* President Elect Trump also believes that flag burning should be restricted to the greatest extent possible (like, apparently, Hillary did). But perhaps he thinks it should be banned entirely. That's the trouble with a 140 character tweet. There is zero room for nuance. 
So what you're saying is just because Clinton proposed it the thing is OK to do? Surely the debate is centred on the fact that proposing such a policy would be a bad idea regardless of who proposed it?
[removed]
Alright, but what if we support Trump, don't agree with this, and want to see Clinton in jail?  
#THE MERE FACT THAT YOU WOULD BE OKAY WITH BURNING A NATIONAL EMBLEM BY USING SOME BULLSHIT 'IT'S FREEDOM OF SPEECH" EXCUSE WHILE ALLOWING RAMPANT LIBERALS TO THREATEN AND PROSECUTE EVERY PERSON WITH RIGHT WING OPINION FOR "HATE SPEECH" IS SO FUCKING SHOCKING THAT I CAN'T EVEN COMPREHEND ALL THOSE FUCKING LAYERS OF IRONY.
Please stop comparing Trump to Hillary when he says something controversial. The election is over and he won.  Now you have to actually take blame and not try to point your criticism towards Hillary.
Hilary isn't going to be the next president. I dont know what point your trying to make.
Trump trolls the media so easily, going to be a fun 8 years. 
No you guys, stop it, this isn't funny.  Flag burning is our first amendment right that our troops have died to protect as they wore the flag into battle and had it laid it over their graves.  Holy shit, I can't believe this is happening.  My mom just came into my room with a fresh plate of tendies and I smacked them out of her hands onto the floor with tear soaked rage.  I thought he was going to stop tweeting.  How will I handle all this oppression and hate if I can't burn the flag?  This is so fucked

Let's not make #TrumpTraps a hashtag. It needs to be a secret strategy.
Doesn't this just show that the MSM is more concerned about the merits of any individual argument and not just to completely support or not support any given candidate?
I didn't know it was possible to troll this effectively, the man is just unstoppable.
I am anxiously awaiting the CNN report of Donald actually owning a time machine otherwise how could be so many moves ahead and right all the time. lol
Womp wommmmp
"TrumpTraps" is a dumb hashtag.

Should be more focused on the hypocrisy of the Media and the Left and not "haha got u cx" 
That moment when you thought you stumped the Trump only to get BTFO.  Glorious.
Trump Traps! Brilliant.

We may end up installing critical thinking into the brains of the left :p 
They're both wrong, but what does her thoughts on it even matter? She lost. When he says something you have to defend what he said not go "but Hillary?!?"

I'm going to burn a flag in honor of both of them
What if you didn't like either tho
But the FPA of '05 only prohibitted it as an act of intimidation or an attempt to incite violence...
can anyone explain?
Wait so does he actually want to jail people for burning the flag or is he just trolling Liberals?
lol he got them to stop burning the American flag and start burning the confederate flag while exposing the hypocrisy of Hillary and her supporters.

Lol now r/enoughtrumpspam is telling it's supposedly PC and tolerant audience to stop burning the flag, what a joke. If you have to tell them to stop you've already lost, and yet we're the sub who's users promote hate
Wait what are people falling for i'm confused? Is trump not actually going to make flag burning illegal?
Loving the Leave Hillary Alone!!!!1!1 comments. You people are missing the point. But she deserves everything she gets and so, SO much more. Most of us have no sympathy whatsoever for the Devil Incarnate, the MSM and almost every big social media outlet had no mercy on Trump, so why should we show HRC the same? Regardless, keep it up, the salt of lefty tears gives us fuel
Jason Miller defends the tweet on CNN.  I can't say I'm still convinced this is trolling:

http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/miller-cuomo-flag-burning-debate-cnntv/

Isn't it funny...

That all of Trump's **absolute shlongings** of the MSM could have been easily avoided by themselves, if they had simply done their basic job duties, as journalists, by conducting some low-effort research *before* losing their goddamn minds and screaming !!!BAD GUY!!! in everyone's face?

Had they been responsible enough to do this, they would have quickly understood his motives here, and called him out on baiting. But as we all know, they aren't interested in being responsible, and aren't going to be.

Which is to say: I'm fucking PUMPED that we get eight more glorious years of witnessing a public shitposting CLINIC put on by the best in the fucking business. 
I'm somewhat indifferent to a flag burning law, leaning towards it being legal on account of libertarian roots.

But I'd bet you one thing: if you burned a US flag on a liberal college campus, it wouldn't cause much of a stir. If you burned a Mexican flag, however, or * gasp * the flag of Islam, you'd cause a major triggering. 
How is it a trap though? He is no longer running against Hillary Clinton. He is president elect. I don't agree with the tweet.
While I get this and get the superior troll abilities of our president elect... this is still a terrible idea, burning a flag is basically a guaranteed right under amend 1. 

I appreciate the incredible salt levels and admit I enjoyed myself in polishits... but intentionally inflammatory shit like this feels weird. Like, why tweet this? it was a terrible idea under hilary in 2005, so dafuq is up with this? 

E: was basically illegal. I meant more so that it wasn't enforced and was considered mostly archaic like how some counties don't let you wash your chickens on tuesdays, etc. The expression itself seems applicable under amend 1. 
trump should just start tweeting out old hillary quotes 
Yeah ok.  He's the President elect and is talking about taking 1st amendment rights away.  Joking or not, it makes me not like the guy.  When anyone in power even begins to talk about taking away rights or even citizenship it is serious business.
It has been edited over 50 times since this news got out in order to make Hillary look less involved.
The election is over and it doesn't matter what HRC said. The focus should be on Trump now, unless we're willing to redo the election based on all of the illegals voting. If that's the case, it does matter that she said that and makes her just as awful.
#TrumpTraps is a different thing on 4chan.  
But you can still burn it to ceremoniously and respectfully discard it, right?
And then she voted against it when the constitutional amendment came up the next year.  Read up, T_D
Am I reading this right? Her and another guy proposed this then one year later voted against it?
Again, THIS TWEET IS WRONG. 

If you actually read the text of the bill it only provides MAXIMUM sentences for flag-burners. Hillary is not advocating for "one year in jail and $100,000 fine," she's saying that's the CAP PUNISHMENT any flag-burner should be privy to. There's a big difference.
flag protection act doesn't say anything about removing citizenship though?
I love Trump... but this brilliant trap has Bannon written all over it.
see, now THIS feels like a complete diversionary tactic. WTF is haps rn?
God I love Trump
Donald Trump be trolling on the highest platform.
Hillary supporting it doesn't make it any less wrong.
Election is over, the comparison is irrelevant. It doesn't matter who proposes this, it's a direct breach of your first amendment rights.
Explain to me how this is supposed to help Trump. Hillary lost. What is there to gain by still attempting to troll her and her supporters? This thread reeks of people being apologists for fascistic restriction of free speech.
God, and to think we have 8 more glorious years of this.  Reminds of how Trump handled the birther issue.  The CBS reporter lost his mind on that one.
"But they did it first!"

Fucking 8 year old logic. Someone else doing it first doesn't mean it's okay for you to do it.
OMG I just have to look through Twitter and search for SJWs that got enraged over the tweet!!!

Trump just exists on a different level than most people.  We're reaching levels of dimensional chess that shouldn't be possible.  
While it would be sweet were this true, the official government website doesn't show Clinton as a co-sponsor.  Is this another Wikipedia error?

Y'all do realize he is no longer competing against Hillary right? 
Lmao, okay Trump I'm not a fan but I'll give you this one.
When are you cucks gonna realize that you are not running against Hillary anymore? Trump won, stop trying to say "Buuuuut Hillary did it too!" No one gives a fuck what she did 10 years ago, but they sure do care about what Trump is saying *now*. It was fucked when Hillary tried it, and it's fucked that Trump tweeted it.
Wait...So Trump proposing Clinton's old policies makes him MORE of the leader you say you want? What sort of mental gymnastics must you do to feign such intellect?  
  
The "I told you so" that will come out of this is going to be historic.

The Trump Administration should go through Hillary's past history of bill introductions, and try to re-propose those bills-- and whenever the MSM would cry over his propositions, his staff would leak that Hillary proposed it originally **everytime** üòÇ

Trump:  Troll Level: Genius 
#CHESSMASTER
It's a stupid idea whoever's it is.
SAD AND DEMORALIZED! SO MANY DIMENSIONS! 
~~That was clever indeed.~~  The part I don't get is why he would do that after he's won the election?
It really doesn't make it any better that Trump want to ban it too.  Trump needs to start unifying not advocating scaling back the first amendment.
Same question I would have for both. Didn't the SCOTUS rule that burning the star spangled banner is a form of protected speech under 1st amendment?
Trump is the Troll King. Stupid media never learns. Seriously i'm on r/politics talking about this situation. Its a fucking disability. And idk wtf claimed that sub was unbiased.
I've been off this sub for a few days, can someone legit tell me what is going on with this story and what is 4-d chess
Maybe I have been on 4chan for too long but #Trumptraps did not have the meaning I thought it did, luckily. 
lolololol -i voted trump because I'm a liberal hater.  Not because of southern heritage 
SCOTUS already ruled on this. Just because CROOKED H did it too, doesn't absolve DT. #Pray4Trump
Can somebody explain what he did here? I don't follow
#WINNING!

I love how Trump holds a mirror up to their faces. 
Justice Scalia voted twice to protect the notion of free speech surrounding flag burning. He said that he didn't like the outcome, but the act of burning flags was protected as free speech under the Constitution. Historically, as evidenced by the Flag Protection Act of 2005, the idea of punishing flag burning has been part of the liberal ideology; and the protection of free speech has been part of the conservative ideology. It's interesting to see those ideas flip sides before our very own eyes.
The media and viewer/reader/listenership, conservatives have not met every single Muslim majority country where the product of my classmates and I think the reason MGTOW is a myth so harmful, toxic, and that was very anti immigration.

First they complain about the freedom of speech of others, then they burn the SYMBOL of free speech, then complain when others complain about their freedom of speech. Yep, sounds like the left. 
Senator Clinton, in Pander mode - The Failing NY times wrote an article in 12/7/05 about it. 
You cannot write this shit
Yeah, cool... but it's Trump who still wants to limit our free speech, and unlike Hillary, he's the one in the position to influence that.
Flag burning is cheap and unpatriotic but it still is a freedom all Americans should have. 
The fact that Hillary Clinton pushed for a bill in the Senate gives you an idea of how bad it is. The media should acknowledge her past support for the measure, but I, for one, don't agree with Trump.
Now watch the MSM spin this to make it seem like he's endorsing Hillary. 

They got nothin!!!
He is going to win so much, and so often, it's going to get boring.  This has been so much fun, and it hasn't even started yet.  It's going to be like Christmas... Every... Single ... Day!  

We. Just. Keep. On. Winning.

Trump never ceases to amaze me.   Sets the trap, MSM walks right into it, then they look like fools.  
It's real nice watching Dems blow themselves out. Every questionable thing Trump has said was legalized by them
So glad our president is so BASED and setting traps for DUMB liberals. Sad! These liberal cucks need to step their game up, Trump is going to keep trapping you! No brakes on this train, all you liberals are going to get TRIGGERED for 8 more years!!!! Centipedes unite!!!!
This is Trump pulling in some of those democratic policies that the libs so desperately want.
this, and when your average shitlib on the streets starts burning american flags in front of millions on the news to 'protest'...well there wont be a lot of people lining up to vote for these cucks...at least LEGAL voters anyway
It's not even funny anymore....it's like picking on a retarded kid.
If Obama said you should receive punishment for burning the flag you'd all be losing your shit right now calling him a fascist.
Trump is doubling down on shitty Hillary policies. This bodes well. 
Are you guys still running against Hillary?

Pedes should keep this fat bitch in check https://twitter.com/ananavarro
My argument for criminalizing it would be that the flag doesn't represent the government the flag represents the people of the United States. We the people rule the country so burning OUR flag is saying you want to up root the system, instead of changing the politicians. You are either for this country or against it people. 
I love this hashtag tbh
It's beautiful. It's perfect. It is god damn genius!
These cucks are too stupid to understand that BASED GOD EMPEROR *knows* that all his Centipedes joyously pounce at the opportunity to expose the cuck hypocrisy when they freak out at something he says or does. He knows he needs to keep us HIGH ENERGY to fight the trench warfare cucks will be waging his entire presidency.

Let me get this straight - you guys think Trump went and looked up the Flag Protection Act, decided to post on twitter saying people who burn the flag should lose their citizenship, and this was all some ploy to attack Hillary Clinton? What does this even have to do with Hillary? It was a stupid idea to fine people when she proposed it, and it's a stupid idea to try to strip citizenship over it now.

Is this what the next four years is going to be like? Trump saying stupid shit, then you guys coming in and going "LMAO BUT HILLARY 4D CHESS"?

She Huma and Hildog can share a cell.
She did not actually commit any fraud herself in terms of filing affidavits.

> Recall that Jill Stein's website is not saying she will file the necessary petition in Pennsylvania thereby subjecting herself to this perjury. Instead, she has collected funds for a "voter-initiated recount." If she were honest, she would instead be calling it a voter-initiated contest. And if she were truly concerned with the danger such voters would be in, she would be the one publishing the warnings you are reading now. 

She did mischaracterize a contest as a recount, and I suppose it would be up t a jury to determine whether that constitutes defrauding her contributors.

The papers actually filed are worth a read. In effect, they allege nothing.

I seriously doubt that she could commit a felony by filing a recount request. . . .  You're allowed to argue your position.

They criticize Trump for this opinion but after finding out that Hillary proposed the EXACT SAME THING they try to lie that she didn't. You can't make this shit up.
I fucking said this this morning! I thought, I bet someone's going to change the entry. So now history is up for debate depending on politics and narrative?! NO! Quit that shit! 

*There also seems to be a lot in the revision history today...

Also, seem to have found the specific entry, changed by Jrinaldi97: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005&diff=752127815&oldid=752127637
Another reason why Wikipedia is just some bullshit.
"We have always been at war with Eastasia."
Day late and a dollar short...par for the course.

Dont forget, they censored Marina Abramovics wikipedia for weeks as well.
The talk section is hilarious.

>Flag Protection Act of 2005 article shows on side panel that one of the senators who sponsored this bills is "Shillary", it should read the Senator's proper name "Hillary" 148.75.1.39 (talk) 17:26, 29 November 2016 (UTC)
Much like Gab and Voat as alternatives to Twitter and Reddit, Wikipedia also has it's own upstart competitor: https://infogalactic.com/info/Main_Page

The SJWs, lefty cucks, and globalists hold no power here. Pls support.
all they have on their side is censorship and disinformation
The amount of edits today are insane
I salute the centipede that tried this.

History gets re-writen on a daily basis ... in 1984. The left is totally fine as long as they are the writers.
Sickening how far they will go to feed us dis-information.

Well, they missed this https://i.sli.mg/UfxCl0.png
/u/Spez stop it already, enough is enough!
i count 74 edits today at the time of this post haha
Today this wikipedia entry is the CTR Twitch stream


The cognitive dissonance is to thick you can taste it. They're literally willing to rewrite history to fit their own narrative. Democrats have no shame. 
Look at the [detailed history](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005&action=history) of the war going on over the page. There are dozens of revision attempts. Then look at the [previous page version](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005&oldid=737279476), which opened by saying Hillary was a co-sponsor of the bill. 
question why would they remove it i feel like thats a good thing right? there should be a flag protection act. Why would she not want her name there?

When they go low we go high.
Clearly facts to them are there weakness unless of course it supports there agenda 
Doesn't matter - history knows: http://archive.is/9Trfn

*edit - from before the Great Wiki War of 2016 began...
Is there any proof she proposed the bill? Sponsoring and proposing are different things.
good thing we can just edit it back :D  I CAN DO THIS ALLL DAY!

I am out of the loop on this. I know Trump tweeted that and I know the media took the bait and that Hillary was a co-sponsor on the '05 bill. 

Here is where I get lost. To borrow a phrase, What difference at this point does it make? 

The recount fell flat, Trump is still president elect, Hillary is still a loser and the press still can't stop taking the bait. Whats is the goal here, aside from being entertaining fuckery? 
Check out who edited it. Some native german very worried about privacy. Probably merkel.
I wish I could say this is surprising. At least the Liberals I know knew about it as I mocked them with it every time they called Trump a dictator. 

Very disturbing they tried to memory hole this. 


Her is in congress archives. Can't do nothing about that one! Keep posting that

IMO T_D has equalized reddit. It is a side effect of a broken ideology. It has driven a wedge between the regressive, leftist, PC safe space culture that has been festering for a while. I've been a redditor for almost 5 years and I remember when this site used to allow mostly uncensored discussions with broader appeals and opinions. Now the arguments are so one sided that its almost cringe worthy to witness. I had to subscribe to voat last year in order to get the full spectrum of opinions on the news/events/etc. Now with T_D I have a sub on reddit (other than KIA) to be able to see spin free news and analysis, sure most is Trump based but they have proven to be open to discuss other current events.

As a former democrat myself what is a shame is how the establishment left has reacted to this, and I don't mean just on reddit. As a whole the left has tried its best to force their ideology down everyones throat in the most blatantly hypocritical way, lose spectacularly, then double down on it instead of having enough self reflection to admit they were wrong and moving on. They are doing this by blaming alternative news, vilifying them as straight up lies when in reality you would have to be incredibly naive to think the establishment isn't leftist propaganda themselves, and this is from someone who voted for Obama twice. This is only fueling Trump and other anti-establishment supporters like myself to move further away from the left. They are essentially destroying themselves and it's extremely entertaining almost like watching a car crash in slow motion.
I was a Bernie delegate in Denver and I prefer this place to r/politics. Seeing different parts of Reddit call you guys bigots is equally hilarious and infuriating. If only liberals would step outside their bubble, maybe they would finally see why they lost the election? Nahh, won't happen.

You know you'd rather hang with us, we got all the cool memes. Besides, we like having you around.
I'm totally with you.

I've been attacked on Reddit just for posting on The Donald. 

When I tell people I didn't vote for Trump or Hillary, that's not good enough.

Not only are you not allowed to vote for Trump, you're not even allowed to listen to what Trump supporters even say. And then they have the audacity to say that the Trump supporters are the bigots.
We're a Fan Club essentially. We let everyone know this subreddit is for Pro-Trump material only.
______

The Reddit Admins are at fault for allowing subs that are supposed to be unbiased like **r./Politics** to turn into Propaganda. They have the audacity to even link to that sub on **r./News** which is a default sub. 
_____

We're not the disease. We're the fever fighting off the disease that the Reddit Admins created. 
Perfect example - that NEVERFORGET post that's lingered in /all for pretty much the last 24 hours...claiming we never said anything about the 2 cops killed by the white guy.  Shit, we were on that WHEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, not a month later as false narrative to try and prove a non-truth.  We also praised the Vice President-Elect for going there personally to lay flowers on the officers' caskets, showing respect for law enforcement which the Left seems incapable of unless they're forced to by formality or political obligation. :(

*edit - so pissed at that /all article I didn't even thank you for coming to share your thoughtful position with us.  THANK YOU for your kindness, willingness and open-mindedness, means a lot in these dark reddit days.
R/The_Donald is a problem of Reddit's own making. With the constant stream of articles from The Guardian and The Independent (two very left-wing papers in the uk), that make it to /all without even appearing on /rising, and with only a small amount of votes. There is clearly an organisation and an agenda at work to control the narrative, and in many cases, deny reality.  

Look at the instant mass censorship that occurred as soon as confirmation came in that the Orlando terrorist was a Muslim. It means this sub has not only become a forum for trump supporters, but in many cases as a reliable source of news. One that is not censored,filtered or manipulated by CNN/MSNBC et all.
My exact same experience.
> It's sad that even as a non-trump supporter, I have to follow r/the_donald to get any semblance of a balanced view on reddit

Careful, that's how you become a Trump supporter :-)

First you come here to laugh at the Trump supporters.

Then you realize all the shitposting is actually quite funny, and you find yourself laughing along with the Trump supporters.

Then you realize there's loads of good, factual information here that never even rates a mention in the news or on other subreddits.  <-- you are currently here

Then you start to realize how fucked up the lies and bias and untruths of the mainstream media and large swaths of the internet are.  The blatantness of it all will disgust you.  You'll find you even start using the term mainstream media non-ironically.

Your transformation at this point is nearly complete, and before long you'll realize that actually you're a Trump supporter too, and you'll marvel at how you could ever have been so blinded to the awesomeness and high-energy of Trump.
Reddit is in San Francisco, run by people who live in one of the most liberal cities in the country. They have allowed the takeover of the largest domreddit r/ [redacted] to promote their left views and corrupt candidate. The CEO has proven himself to be an immature and corrupt crybaby who thinks of Reddit as his personal playground and doesn't realize the current power and nature of what he help create so long ago. r/The_Donald is the antithesis of the lying left that is rampant on Reddit. There is a reason Trump won and Hillary lost. People are fed up with this kind of shit and Hillary became synonymous with corrupt and crazy, just as r/ [redacted] and u/ [Reddit CEO] have. 

This post may have been edited by u/ [crybaby spez]
Glad to have ya! People who dip a toe in the water here CIVILLY are usually welcomed warmly!! Cheers :)
I try to spend time at Politics occasionally, but the amount of straight up ignorance and condescension there is over whelming. I usually get pissed off after less than 5 minutes. And the sources are shit. Yesterday, I went to the front page and there was CNN, VOX, Huff Post, NBC and a bunch of lesser rags. It's just shit. 
I now come here before looking at other corporate media news sites. This place is more honest. Even if something here turns out to be incorrect, it at least is an honest mistake.
it odd, im from the uk and im against a few of his policies. but and it's a big but i would rather have him in place to fight against this honestly scary authoritarian left/SJW that is one of the biggest threats to the west and the idea of truth, freedom and innocent until proven guilty (college campus where its the other way around)

trump may not be perfect but they way things are going its what the world need, also we need an ally in america because after brexit the EU will become very punitive....like a child that doesn't get its way. lastly globalism has taken a big it as well which makes me very happy(with globalism the only winners are the ones who are now losers)
I used to just lurk here for the same reason, to see the counter narrative. Then I went ahead and subscribed. I got a message in my inbox from /r/offmychest about how they're going to ban me permanently unless I unsub from the_donald and that blatant disrespect is another reason I've stuck around here. There are a lot of redditors who are against free speech, plain and simple. And to that I must simply retort praise Kek and pass the coats and pepes. 

Tendies, man. I do find it kind of hilarious that the mods of /offmychest banned me because of t_d. It just reeks of that "safe space" mentality. 
It's so true. Thankfully the people here give enough of a shit to help put fact out there for everyone
I'm a convert... and I love it here.
I started off in the politics subreddit 12 months ago. I noticed it was more of a anti-trump and pro-bernie then pro-hillary subreddit. I get that they hate him but for fucks sake at least talk about some positives Trump brings to the table and there's a lot of it. 

r/politics more like r/antitrump 

Then I came here to the Donald and realized I belong here. I will never leave this subreddit ever in my life now.
That's exactly why I started following.

I didn't support trump, but I knew I was being fed bullshit. I just didn't know the extent of it.  

This sub has its own bias obviously, but it's invaluable when it comes to seeing the other perspective even when I disagree.
You will be shitposting in weeks..welcome aboard. :p
Well, glad you didn't vote for Queen Hillary The Wicked and that you enjoy reading our nonsense.

I hope Trump will grow on you in time.
Hear hear!  This place is a fantastic balance of factual information and entertainment.  My favorite site on the web right now.

And welcome friend!  I hope Trump does well enough to earn your vote in 2020.   
It's kind of unbelievable what an utter shitshow r/redacted has become. I know I'm biased, but I tried to give it an honest shot this morning... surely, it couldn't be **that** bad! And sure enough, *every single story* for 4-5 pages (then I quit) was about - and attacking - Trump. It's not even about politics anymore, it should just be renamed r/Trump_Hate. That would be more honest. 
We shitpost to cope with being RedPilled. üòÇüòÇüòÇ I don't know what I would do without the daily shitposts. Other subs are depressing compared to T_D
I read stuff from here, but not subscribe. It's easy to just view /r/all and sort by top of the hour. That way you get the news fresh and from a different view than normal. Makes a good balance. 
Thanks bro it really is crazy and I don't understand what is going on in America this year. Liberals and the main stream propaganda machine are going full Nazi mode...just making up shit at this point.
I like you
That's what brought me to the sub. I got tired of all the alt-left stories and reading how Killary is so great and thinks of women. Uh...no she cares about the money. Her own emails prove it. 

Plus that crap with Bernie should've been awake up call for liberals. The DNC is not a fair system where a common man can rise up and do something great. The DNC is controlling and corrupt and has taken control of our media. I want the good and the bad. I damn sure want to form my own opinions. 

Glad I voted Trump. I can read what he really said and bypass MSM.


The entire mainstream media in America is systemically corrupt. CNN, NYT, WaPo, NBC, everybody. Their purpose is to spread state propaganda to control the populace. 

That's it. It's not as though propaganda is a secondary goal to informing the public -- they don't want to inform the public. They want the public to be uninformed. 

Social media is precisely the same. All news must be propaganda, and all viewpoints expressed must be homogenous. Who gets to decide what's decent? They do. Who gets to decide what's true? They do. Everything else must be censored.

It's astonishing. 

The biggest threat to the left in America is the truth. Truth is Kryptonite. Facts are anathema and those who share them are pariahs. 

We share them anyway. We tell the truth anyway. And the Left seethe with hate for us, because they can't control the threat. 

So. Keep coming back, and we'll keep telling the truth. Thanks for the open mind. 
We've got a huge closet full of comfy coats... just sayin'... 
Baby steps are still steps in the right direction
The other side has gone so ridiculously far off the rails that the only way to bring things anywhere close to the middle again is for us to swing way off in the other direction. 
Even if you're not a Trump supporter, I think that's pretty cool you're enough of a leader that you do not allow yourself to be brainwashed by media and neo lib ideology that we are all racist, homophobic, Islamophobic, mysogynists. I think looking through our sub you can easily see that is a lie, and yet they spout it as if that's all we are. Sure that may represent a tiny faction, as it would any group, even Hillarys, but we strongly disavow that here. Yet that doesn't stop them from labeling half of America as such simply because CNN and Hillary say it is so. So your open mindedness and honesty are very much appreciated. 

Also even if you are not a Trump supporter, at least when you speak you are open minded to debate topics you may disagree with, and not just call ppl racist and walk away. That's the difference. There's nothing at all wrong with disagreeing in a healthy manner. It's when they assault us physically for our beliefs and then blame their behavior on us that it is wrong.
And you're welcome to it.  Contrary to popular belief posting honest inquiries will not get you banned.  Trolling like an asshole will.

Welcome aboard friend.
Come here any time; we continue to take passengers on the Trump Train.  

No one here is obligated to agree with one another on all things.

You too can be a Centipede.  Just ask for your coat.  One of us! One of us!
There's a reason why there are so many ex-lefties here.  Places like reddit made it abundantly clear how toxic the label had become.  
We are the anomaly in the matrix!
Cheers, OP. Should your political beliefs ever change, there's a coat with your name on it here at /r/The_Donald.
You mean you don't like reading corporate proopoghanda? 

WTF! UNAMERICAN!!@!@#
I don't fully support Trump either, but I feel like he won't be that bad. This subreddit helps me see that. I definitely support it all the way. Plus, Trump is 2,000,000x better than Clinton.
Of course they're all leftists, The complete subversion of the west by communism has been happening for decades. Mainstream Media is only one of the tools they use.
There's also social media, hollywood, the music industry, literature and pseudo-scientific fields (like psychoanalysis). it's all infiltrated by the same thing. 

It goes by many names, trotskyism, marxism, communism, social justice, globalism.

The control of the media, the promotion of open borders, the concept of one world government, the obliteration of racial identity. It's all tied together by the same common thread,

If you happen to go down that rabbit hole you'll be able to trace the lineage of communism to other things too,  but thats a discussion for another day. 
It quite obvious how this happens.

Push away a group of people from many places and they will concentrate on the remaining places.

That's one reason the_donald became so big, because liberals wage war against free speech in many places, virtual or not.

That's also the reason why /r/[redacted] is becoming worse every day, because no sane person would participate in that shithole anymore, or at best to amuse themselves with their stupidity.

That's also the reason why uncensored news comment sections are almost always more right wing than the average person.

Then the newspaper notices that concentration one day and suddenly there is a Nazi/white supremacist/you name it-Problem, despite that they (the ones who censored, not the ones with higher right wing concentration) created that concentration.

And finally, that alleged Nazi problem is used to discredit the news source, which puts pressure on them to censor the comment section.

Nasty people, disgusting strategy.
R/Uncensorednews  has a few decent posts as well.. but r/redacted is like left leaning as can be
Donald Trump is more democratic than the democrats, and more republican than the republicans, and more libertarian than the libertarians, and definitely more green than the green party
This is a big reason we have more online users than /r/[redacted]
Welcome Patriot.

Despite your reticence to vote for Trump, you have acknowledged the "Great Truth" is actually a lie.  Sad, but nonetheless, you will be better for the knowing.
This is what led me to end up voting for Trump.  3 months ago I was "Never Trump".  Now I am coat wearing pede that just wants to MAGA.  

Can't stop this train.
I've known the media was full of shit for a while but I didn't realize how deep it went. Wasn't a fan of Trump initially but then realized he was on the wrong end of one of the most vicious smear campaigns ever. Since he won, I've grown to like the movement. It's getting cold, can I get a coat?
I get ya tbh most people here weren't on the trump train including me cause i thought he was joke but come earlier this year around the orlando shooting got my eyes open to the bullshit that was happening that and brexit.
Honestly, the stupidest and most inaccurate view of this subreddit was posted a few days ago on r/politics. It was the cyanide and happiness comic on black friday. I've been lurking here for a while, and I've never seen a post anything like what they were spewing. It just seemed like something they'd do.
#GET THIS PATRIOT A COAT!
I don't venture out beyond the big beautiful wall of /r/The_Donald, it's far too scary.
We have a coat waiting for you if you want it 
I came here after the Orlando shooting and haven't looked back. Used to be a Berniebro until I seen the mass censorship happening, then hopped on the Trump train. Welcome. 
We're happy to have you here! Sad how biased media is these days. 
Take the redpill OP, you can wash it down with water, crush and snort it, administer it rectally, or dissolve and inject for highest bioavailability. 

once you get on the redpill, you don't get off it. you're woke for life
I agree with your sentiments!

As an independent voter /r/the_Donald gave me important information, admittedly biased but important nonetheless, in choosing who I would vote for. Even though it was biased it's over things that truly matter, like Clinton foundation and pizza gate.

All other places had a constant spin over nonsensical topics that don't really matter except to inflame people. And you could tell that's what they were trying to do. There should be no place for that type of behavior in "mainstream" sub's on Reddit. In my humble opinion.
For me, the_donald *is* reddit. 
You should sub if you haven't already!
Thank you for doing your part.

Get this HIGH ENERGY PATRIOT A COAT!

NO BRAKES!!
I share your frustration.  Often I want to read opinions from the intelligent or what I call the cogent-left, just to see the perspective they're coming from.  Social media is saturated with identity politics in one massive mental illness parade of guilt, victimology, and virtual signalling.  Whereas establishment leftist publications have set a kamikaze course for globalism.  

To be quite honest, I'm not sure where center-left thought resides anymore. 
There's a nice warm coat waiting for you on the day you decide to board the train.
10/10 you hit the nail right on the head.

its how I grew into a trump supporter
soon there will be only 1 main sub - /r/The_Donald 

everything else left will be pitiful groups of several k subscribers with 1% online activity, all spewing hate and getting triggered between themselves whilst all of us here are WINNING 
I tended to like Trump more than Hillary, but not enough to vote for him. If anything, this sub helped me realize that the media spin and fear-mongering on the left is worse than I thought.

I have to read both /r/politics and /r/The_Donald because the former won't show anything positive about Trump and the latter will never show anything negative. I don't think that's necessarily bad, but at least this sub is explicitly biased.
Thats not our fault, we try to be as fucking unbalanced as possible around here.

I keep getting referred back to this location for the truth about Trump.  Been lurking for a couple months and this thread finally made me join.  My wife was a lifelong democrat.  This election and the audacity of the lies coming from the MSM converted her over to the Republican Party.  Keep hitting them with the truth, we are making a difference.  
Since you posted here you will now be auto-banned from a bunch of subs if you post in them.
Thanks for checking us out! 
And this! This is why I'm spending my own money to promote the news we find here so it doesn't stay here. patvote.com - pede sourced news and Patriot ratings of people and companies! WE are the new media!
I didn't vote trump, but I'm glad Hillary lost.  I read this subreddit for the same reasons as OP.  Also, I'm warming up to trump.  If he does what he says he will do, or even half what he says he will do, I'll vote for him next time.  
I went over to Trump because of the corruption within our government and extreme lies of MSM and so called liberals. It was so obvious. I'm still not sure how people can not see it, like you have to work really hard to swallow that crap. The hypocrisy and illogical thinking of the left is astounding.
What I like even better is that whenever news come out that benefit Trump, but are fake, Centipedes are quick to call bullshit on it.

No real confirmation bias here.
Look at us, look at us. 

We are the rebel punks now.
How do we get you to convert? Baptized in liberal tears or drowning your face in Trump women cleavage? Which do you prefer?

somebody has been on r/politics 

Started with hating both candidates, now I'm here winning everyday with ya'll. feelsgoodman.
Any liberal who intentionally ignores conservative views is a bigot. Same for any conservative who ignores liberal views. It's the definition of the word. 

For all pedes, see the story from all sides to avoid falling into the snowflake protection shield, common called an "echo chamber".
as a supporter of trump, i comoletely agree.

everytime i go over to r/politics, i cringe
OP, what are your other news sources outside reddit?  I ask bc I'm trying to understand what my liberal friends are reading. I've long abandoned Facebook and I feel totally out of sync with their worldview.
So you are telling me you don't believe Trump is the love child of Hitler and Castro. Wait, I mean Hitler and and and and and and um
MSM just keeps shooting themselves in the foot because their lack of fact-checking is finally catching up to them.

They want to jump on every little thing Trump does as negative only to realize, whoops Hillary did similar shit. You can't really take their efforts as legit news when you begin to see that their narrative is just based on the objective of making Trump look bad regardless of what he does.

While we might seem overzealous due to the **HIGH ENERGY**, that's because this subreddit, for the most part, is a 24/7 never ending Trump rally.

By design and intent.

You just assumed my reporting quality? Oh yeah you can because this is the one place on reddit that doesn't have podesta's dick in their ass.  
I feel your pain, it's disgusting at how most of reddit is, just constant attacks and not real information. I thought I would stop visting this subreddit, but I actually can learn with real news facts instead of the bias news... 
Same deal for me. Being a Canadian, I was just lurking this subreddit out of curiosity. It just made too much sense, memes are spicy and the shitposts are top notch
Does this guy deserve a coat? I think we need a coat.
Sad! (Not sad you're here)
It's actually bullshit how like a of reddit seems to think we're all straight white males lul reeeee
It definitely makes the left look bad. They should try upvoting something neutral and balanced. But they can't, that's why they lost.

Dude same
You're welcome here.  There's wayyyyyyy too much bias on the other side.  

We need balance to the force.  
Why are you going to reddit for your political research?  The candidates have been alive much longer than the latest "headline", and articles rarely contain enough information to rely on.  Perform research that limits bias, not increases it. 
There's plenty of room on this train!
It was never about Trump vs Hillary but the Average Voter vs The Propaganda Machine. You can be a diehard bleeding heart lib and understand the nature of the media machine working to destroy this country.
And I personally speak out against shit on here that doesn't have proof. One idiot said a Muslim started the wildfire in Tennessee. That's not what we are about here. 
It's so true. I would be completely confused about what is going on and how he even got elected if it weren't for communities like this. Though I'll be honest, I wish I could filter out all the Pepe (sorry, I know you love it!). It reminds me of college and makes me cringe. haha
As a Trump supporter its sad to me too. Don't get me wrong I love this place, but its not meant to be, never was, never will be, and never has claimed to be a non-partisan "balanced" Domreddit. I like coming here for the fun, the party, the memes, the shitposts, and the red pills, but I do desire a place for real non-partisan discussion. Sadly that place does not exist anywhere on reddit or elsewhere for that matter. Its sad and actually quite a danger to society at large.
r/The_Donald was my red pill on a lot of issues. Soon you'll be wanting to MAGA and get that wall **TEN FEET HIGHER!!!** with the rest of us. 
Yeah, and what's even sadder is that on /r/politics, I have to sort by controversial to see any kind of discussion that isn't an echo chamber. On any other subreddit, I can sort by best with confidence, but /r/politics? *shudder*
The future is insane. 
Reddit is one big cannibalistic spirit cooking rapefest, and if you aren't as Satanic as they are, you simply aren't allowed in their club.

Look at the scumbags running Reddit and Twitter and Facebook.  Would you even buy a bag of chips from them?  And no, unlike Jack, I won't say pizza.
Punch those buttons Pedes and GET THIS TO /r/all !
Come over if you want, but don't bring your liberal ideals with you and ruin the place, assimilate. 
I don't really get it. Doesn't the leftist side seem just as insane to us as we do to them? I don't believe you can immediately discredit EVERYTHING they say.
You are awesome ! Thank you for checking by :)
I think the recent flag comment showcases that we aren't blind devotee for the most part here so we try to be fair.
I know how you feel. I want to unsub from this so bad since the election is over and I'd like to move on with my life, but I would be left completely in the dark if I did. 
Thank you for being so friendly and polite! You're welcome to hop aboard the Trump Train at any given time. 
Honestly it really is pretty sad that there is less bias here than on the fucking main politics reddit page...
You can't even call it a user created community when the CEO edits posts and the whole system is quite literally rigged against one part of that community.  /r/The_Donald posts are literally and reddit has admitted this, weighed differently and won't show up on /r/all as often as other subreddits regardless of upvotes.
This isn't even left versus right, it's a rag-tag band of political outsiders against a vicious union between corporate cronyism and cultural marxism.

Since any level of effort and success will create an inequality, the progressive poison allows any good and able person to be re-labelled as an oppressor. The people already in power are more than willing to cynically abuse this movement as an excuse for exercising even greater control over society.
also check out /r/KotakuInAction for more discussions that don't conform to Reddit's narratives.
I'm not sure why you think any other place should be a better source of news. We are the media now.

Even if I preferred Hillary, (I don't), there's no way to get a balanced political understanding without reading both Breitbart and Politico. If journalism dies soon, it will be because of this.
Sure, we post a lot of great things about The Donald, and a lot of bad things about leftist in general; but at least we try to ensure that our posts are factually accurate. That's what I love about this community. 
Yup, as an Australian with a significant interest in US politics, I visit here all the time for a reasonably balanced view. I consider myself slightly left leaning, but I really can't handle the American 'left' that has been on full display through this whole election cycle. If I were from the US I'd almost certainly identify with you guys far more. 

/r/politics looks like it has been sold to supporters of certain political party. Kinda crazy that people don't make a bigger deal of that. 
I realised how disconnected the media (and almost everyone I know IRL) was from reality when I joined this sub. Knew Trump was going to win when my friend still thought he was a joke. 
I was not a Hillary supporter,  was leaning 3rd party.  I came in here for the very first time and left an innocuous comment, whereupon I was immediately banned from like 2 subs.  The bans stated that I had posted in a sub that had been determined to be hate speech.  Therefore,  autoban.

I was a new reddit user and was so shocked that I literally couldn't believe it.  Whatever Donald Trump was about he and his supporters were definitely not about hate.

I came back into the one place that welcomed me and my views and I've never left.  I come from many generations of dems, libs... and that whole thing has completely changed.  They've become everything they said they were against. 
yessss....keep consuming those red pills....give in to the darkside.  Here....try this...your first pepe is free...
Dude how do you think we all became trump supporters?
www.drudgereport.com is also a good alternative. The stories all link to some other news organization's article and the website is kept to a bare minimum. It's right leaning but a lot of times his curated top stories influences televised news. 

Every once in a while you'll hear his name, Matt Drudge, or his website referenced in mainstream media, just in case someone tells you not to go there.
Yeah it's good but the frog meme is a bit obnoxious

Not even sworn in yet and done more than Obama! 
I cannot not wait until CNN tells me why this isn't a good thing...... Wait guys, is it even legal for us to be reading this information? Can someone find Chris Cuomo to tell me what I should think?
This is what fucking Obama should have been doing? What Trump just did shows how incompetent that damn Kenyan is and that he serves no damn purpose in that office. Trump hasn't even begun working as President yet, and he is achieving results. 
No more Mexico? But they had some nice beaches!
STICKY! Even if briefly!

MSM will never cover this. Let the people know that we are WINNING! and that Trump is WORKING HIS ASS OFF to MAGA and that we should be too!

Also that he is doing what he said he would do. How refreshing. 
With the help of Pence. They are showing the rest of the country how to do this. Governors -- pay attention. Professor Trump is speaking!

i wonder if half of CNNs following is centipedes who are waiting to shitpost them and expose their hypocrisy. 
Fucking CNN. They're so easy to bait, they'd eat arsenic if I sprinkled it on a burger and said it was salt.
LMAO. So Trump's campaign only 'hyped' Secretary of State Betrayus in order for the lying media to admit the problem with putting a classified information mishandler into a top position? **12D blindfolded speed chess**.
Chaffetz was on Fox today and they asked him the same question.  He replied that Petraeus had been fined and disciplined whereas Hillary still won't even admit to any wrong doing on her part.  He also said they were continuing with the info gathering and were just waiting for Trump to drain the swamp so they could start the process of bringing it home to the Clintons and cronies.
Based Chaffetz!
But perhaps this is a supreme shitpost?  I don't think they deserve that much credit though.

Trump is operating on so many dimensions its insane 
These people are clearly out of their minds.  They don't even get it!
CNN is parody at this point.
Oh. My. God.
GEN Petraeus screwed up and shared classified info with MAJ Broadwell, a West Point commissioned Army Intel Officer with TS/SCI clearance (also his biographer and mistress).    He paid a fine and didn't contest.  Hillary's FOIA evading system resulted in god knows how many leaks to Iran, China, Russia etc. and she continues to deny any wrongdoing!
But yet the facts that showed she did was Rusiia and not true... huh??

What's funny to me is during one of my regular listenings to a conservative talk show radio, the host was going off, and I mean OFF about how Trump could even consider this man. He was livid! Calling him a backstab bet, betrayer, etc. and I'm just chilling thinking "this man I've been listening to for years... is blind to the Trump tactics." 
And it just made me smile. Cause if Trump can fool the brilliant conservative then he can fool the incompetents news networks. And it'll only MAGA.

How fucking dumb can you be to see Trump dangling this bait in front of you? He literally played CNN like they can't remember what they had for lunch yesterday. The guy got indicted over 1/10th of what Hillary has done while she was actually the position he is a candidate for.
Is this real life?
Is CNN really this fucking dumb?

Time was not good to that guy. 
Back when this recount business started, someone commented "I wonder how long it will take the Green Party to disavow Jill Stein?"

About a week, apparently. 
Maybe publicly, but you know they're happy about all that extra $$$ in the parties coffers. 
From [this crazy green party letter](http://www.flowersforsenate.org/greens_speak_out_recount) with lots of people undersigned:

> There are significant electoral reforms needed to make elections more democratic and more representative of the people. While we support electoral reforms, including how the vote is counted, we do not support the current recount being undertaken by Jill Stein.

# NO REFUNDS
Well. It's true. Why would I vote for the green party? Because I perceive them as independent. Do they look independent? No they look like the horse that pulls the war-wagon of the Clinton Campaign.
Disavow!  

Maybe Stein will go full Democrat now and we'll see that Franken/Stein 2020 campaign.
>The decision to pursue a recount was not made in a democratic or a strategic way, nor did it respect the established decision making processes and structures of the Green Party of the United States (GPUS). The recount has created confusion about the relationship between the Green and Democratic parties because the states chosen for the recount are only states in which Hillary Clinton lost. There were close races in other states such as New Hampshire and Minnesota where Clinton won, but which were not part of the recount. And this recount does not address the disenfranchisement of voters; it recounts votes that were already counted rather than restoring the suffrage of voters who were prevented from voting.

**BTFO by your own party**
Self destructing in 3...2...1

Question is, what is Hillary's next move? Plan appears to be imploding.
Based green party. 

I can respect that.

Rebelling against Jill's structured soros settlement.
Another Green Party member filed a complaint against her regarding the WI recount, apparently.

http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/11/28/495554/Complaint-alleges-perjury-and-fraud-in-Jill-Stein-recount-petition
HAHAHAHAHA

Can they tell her she can't use any of their funds now that they might be "short" a bit.
So now the Green Party gets Soros' money and Jill is out to pasture.
When will they learn??? 

 YOU CAN'T STUMP THE TRUMP
Fuck off Stein. Everyone is turning against you, just fuck off
Stein is compromised after falling to corruption. Very SAD!
They bought Bernie a vacation home, and Stein a weed farm.


She saw that lakehouse that Bernie got and she thought her integrity was worth just as much, if not more.
Jill Stein should have used this election to her advantage, it was a great time to promote her party, gain more support from people who didn't want to vote Trump but hated Hillary but she ruined it by being a Soro's shill.


#SAD!
From the looks of it, everyone in the Green Party but Jill Stein signed that thing...all 200 of them!  

:)
EVERYONE SAVE FACE NOW!

>massive voter suppression

What voter suppression is that?  Anyone and their Madre can vote as many times as they want if you vote Dem?
"The racist and undemocratic historical logic of the Electoral College"

Wut?

And voter suppression of minorities in various ways? You mean the fact that people make a decision on their own to not vote?

God, the green party is just as cucked as the dems.


Jesus Murphy, where were you guys during the election?
Ooked her right in the dooker. 
The Green Party is dead-in-the-egg due to all of this this nonsense. Good. 
Nice.   Bugger off Jill.
Too bad the letter is so fucking chock full of crazy.

Man that's rough. She lost all 11 of her supporters. 
Thanks for your non-refundable donations though! peace out

She can't pass off that money as 'for the party'. She will be sued for much of what she took in.

God Emperor did come back to this timeline to warn Americans that this was a scam.
Why are they always trying to rewrite history?  This is in congressional records and editing Wikipedia won't do anything.

Dare I say the left is trying to fake the news? 
Revisionist history.

This is the shameless game they play, is there any wonder why all the History books are cucked?
Expect lots of confusion on this one.  There were at least 2 "Flag Protection Act of 2005"s.  The first one, in June of that year, did not have Hillary sponsoring.  The second one, in October, did.  Neither one went anywhere.

Fun Fact:  The two acts are nearly identical, the difference being that the one Hillary backed had stronger language and called for a $250,000 fine in several instances.  Both were introduced by Democrats, with the second one boasting higher profiles as Clinton and Boxer.   If I had to guess, they couldn't get support for the first, beefed it up and re-introduced with star power.

Either way, don't be fooled!  She was not listed on the first, she WAS listed on the second, nearly identical bill.

June Bill (HR 1974):  https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/1974

October Bill (S 1911):  https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/1911/
I bet half the political shit on Wikipedia is edited by loser libs with nothing better to do.
Ministry of Truth says this is double plus ungood though
If they refute that bill, Hillary is down to 2 major accomplishments in the Senate?

It was funny when people like Obama came out and said "His campaign staff kept him away from twitter like a little kid." knowing they never tweet their own stuff.  This pretty much proves that things they tweet out goes through many different groups before someone posts it.  They are being kept away like little kids, not PEOTUS

You can't bargain with lefties. Cognitive dissonance is strong.
I've had the a similar conversation with my buddies except we all voted Trump. We concluded that President Trump is one of the best fisherman in the entire world.

He throws one small bait and lands himself a bunch of large whales. If President Trump was in Moby Dick, he would have landed that large white whale in a matter of minutes.
Something I figured out a long time ago:

When someone resorts to "no that's different" and then uses the most asinine mental contortions to explain the nonexistent difference then both you and they know that they have been logically outmaneuvered.

The downside is that the level of irrational thinking required for the "no that's different" argument all but guarantees that they're so awash in delusion that they won't see their own double standard.

The upside is that the salt content of their tears increases to Dead Sea levels.
time for new friends! :D 
Just wait until he finds out Hillary voted for a wall too!

him: i will admit that there is a possibility he wasnt speaking about sexual assault if you will admit that there is a possibility he was.

me: no. he literally says that they let him. by your logic, if you ever talked about how a girl let you kiss her without asking, you are speaking about intentional sexual assault.

him: thats different, and youre clearly biased.

Hillary 2002: vote for Iraq war irrelevant

Trump 2002: saying it was a maybe alright idea (once) and only if the intel was correct that they had WMDs followed by 30 instances of saying it was a horrible idea RELEVANT OMG SHAKING
hillary was literally in favor of everything before she was against it.

If they can overlook her telling banks that she has a public stance and a private stance on issues; then they can and will overlook anything
Holy multidimensional Calvinball checkmate!
Why would Hillary's bill in 2005 be irrelevant ? Are the Libtards actually saying that ?  Wouldn't that mean her entire career is irrelevant ?
Speaking of irrelevant, who's Hillary?
The worst thing about these situations is that to them it just doesn't matter. They are experts at cherry picking and mental gymnastics so in their minds the flag act never happened. "Nah I don't believe you....PUSSSY PUSSSSSY PUSSSSSSSSSSSY"
Do you think the God Emperor brought up the flag burning because he knew Hillary sponsored this bill 11 years ago?  This is some 2005D Chess Shit right here. 
The argument now is what they said about Bill Clinton.

"Hillary isn't running for President" (she is)
And if anyone says, "b-but Hillary only wanted to ban burning the American flag when the flaming flag is being used violently!", tell them to read the bill itself. It was more broad than they're implying.

From the [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/1911/text):

> (b) Actions Promoting Violence.‚ÄîAny person who destroys or damages a flag of the United States with the primary purpose and intent to incite **or** produce imminent violence **or** *a breach of the peace*, and under circumstances in which the person knows that it is reasonably likely to produce imminent violence **or** *a breach of the peace*, shall be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both

All emphasis mine.

Amazing that Trump with his tweets is exposing the double standards of the Left.  LOL
Thank you. Just replied with this meme to a cuck over on r/[redacted]. This is our Reddit now.

Hamilton actor's rapist tweets from 2012 aren't relevan and it was only a joke.
You guys realize we won the election, right? Why continue to attack an already *massively* defeated opponent? She's single-handedly responsible to losing the Presidency, Senate, and House. If they're smart, they'll never let her hold public office again. If we're lucky, they try...

I think I there's way too much confirmation bias trying to link this off-the-cuff remark to Hillary or potential policy. SCotUS' has already ruled that burning the flag is a Constitutionally-protected right, and no bill or President can change that. Only an amendment or future court decision could reverse it.

Personally, I think flag-burning is one of the greatest demonstrations of our civil liberties in the US. Even if it's done for hateful, anti-American sentiments it's still a powerful exercise of the freedom to *openly and without fear* express contempt for our federal government.

That's a rare commodity in our world, and makes me proud of our country.
This is probably the most used meme here, which doesn't speak well for liberals.
#glorious
Our meme skills keep getting stronger! 
pussy tape? sounds like the porno I just spanked to, lmao (just dont put the DVD case under a blue light!)
They will pick and choose whatever weapon is around.
While holding numerous contradictory positions, and after that the SJW-type feminists will tear apart any woman who hates themselves, you don't do this, or at least the majority of the nicest, most even-keel and probably still do, that doesn't agree with my phone, stream if he get's outsmarted by an SJW on reddits, crushing losers on those topics come up with.

What if they just *up* the crime for burning someone else's American flag like what was going on in Hampshire College? Make it a felony hate crime.
Obviously none of the above I mean come on are people even aware of the. [**CURRENT YEAR**](http://sli.mg/user/i/edit/?i=EIZSYh)
I'M SHOOK FAM
This is perfect
I am convinced. Trump doesn't play 4D chess to crush his opponents, he plays it just to pass the time.
So are all of you dumb cunts? No one cares who the fuck wants to ban flag burning. It's unconstitutional and our President elect had the idea to ban in along with Hillary, neither of them give a shit about your rights. If you attack one person for it give shit to Trump too, or you should kys.
Lol

A few of the other backwards scrambles of shame I've seen and my rebuttals on this topic:

>Who care about Hillary, this about Trump!

You're half right. Hillary is irrelevant. What is relevant is that once again the media has shown it is not to be trusted on the topic of the President Elect. That tweet was worded to exactly invite comparison with the Flag Preservation Act. Twenty minutes (or less!) of research could have turned up the wikipedia article on it... instead the media charged him full steam like a bull charging a red flag.

>First amendment!

Yeah. Good thing a tweet isn't actually a bill presented to congress for ratification into law. You know, that thing that's done by the legislative branch of the government? (psst. The President heads a different branch) It's also a good thing that the SCOTUS has already ruled it's okay to burn flags.

>Three appointments; they could overturn that!

Ignoring the fact that in order for this case to get back to the supreme court so they could do so, someone would need to prove they were harmed by another person burning a flag.

>it's disgusting that a President would think that way!

Does he? I've just got done pointing out, the tweet was meant to mimic an old bill that was proposed as a trap for the media. And even if he does think that, I've just pointed out all the reasons why this won't ever become federal law. Either way looks like a case of "No Harm, No Foul." to me.

1. Cry in the streets and start riots because you think gay marriage is going away despite Trump saying "it's been decided already".

2. Praise man that had gay people executed by firing squad. 

Leftist mental disorders. 
Read anything about Trump on /r/redacted it's always the same story.

Trump makes an off hand comment or tweet, *which is super scary frightening and will certainly lead to fascism and countless deaths and war*
My friend who worships Che Guevara and Castro has been complaining about Pence for months, each I mention Che's and Castro's policies on gays he always gets pissed
Liberals don't actually give a shit about LGBT rights, they only use us as political pawns. Islam's growing presence in the West threatens me way more than Mike Pence does.
It's not "remember when". They still are, right now.
Remember that no lefty actually cares about the people she claims to care about.  The whole thing is a posture to appear virtuous.  These modern day Pharisees follow whatever social justice fad is hot at the moment, which leads them to fight for gay rights one month and then fight for the expansion of Wahhabi Islam into the West the next.  We all have to stop listening to people whose primary concern is asserting their moral superiority to others. 
Leftist here and this is the message I have for EVERYONE.


Pence does not hate you. It's quite the opposite, he cares about you A LOT. He disapproves of you being gay, he thinks it's a poorer life than you could lead and he wants the best for you. I know a lot of people who are 'anti-gay' but they do not HATE people who are gay. Pence is definitely in that camp, he does not in any way hate you, stop fucking being a dickbag about it. Tell him he's wrong, not that he's a hateful shitbag.

I think Pence is ok, we just have EXTREME differences on our point of view.

Oh and back to shitposting.
This is why I feel bad arguing with these people. It's like arguing with an extremely stubborn 7 year old. I can win the argument and still not feel like I accomplished anything.
I'm gay here. Pence is no hero for gay marriage, but he never said anything about forced (or unforced) electroshock therapy that I can find.
Fucking libs are retards
I want to share a beer with this man... what a man what a politician. Silver fox. 
Liberals have already put themselves in internment camps by accepting this victimhood complex ideology. 
This sort of stuff red pills kids hard
The left think the Castro gay camps are an unfair thing to mention as the occasional gay man might be convicted for indecency at the same time in the Free World.
Lefties don't care about gay people. They're only using them as a tool for virtue signalling by 'standing up' for an 'oppressed' minority group.

You can replace gays with women, Latinos, blacks, natives, cripples, animals, 'the environment' etc and the same modus operandi is used.
Silver Fox's tie looks like a great Christmas present idea
How about we send them to Milo to get redpilled? 
r-socialism right now:

Muslim, bake gays in the oven, THE RELIGION OF PEACE

Fidel wasn't white so it's okay.
I'm something of a disaffected Canadian liberal, and my impression is that these kinds of people only have the strength of conviction to judge people living in white majority 1st world countries.  As soon as the antagonist stops being a privileged shitlord they lack the spine to speak up.

Liberals have a disease. Their brains are broke. 
Mr. Clarke on the other hand ... really seems to like Gitmo.
Can anybody link me to the sources for why the left are so terrified of Pence and how they imagine he will treat the gay community? 

I've heard a lot about it but nothing concrete. 
The New York Time's take on Cuba's treatment of HIV patients (and gays):

> Whatever debate may linger about the government‚Äôs harsh early tactics ‚Äî until 1993, everyone who tested positive for H.I.V. was forced into quarantine ‚Äî there is no question that they succeeded.

http://archive.is/sAbm
left wing people are fucking insane, that should be clear as day by now. They STILL fail to see how harmful islam is towards Europe even after hundreds are killed.
This is why we have the best gays. They are well aware that Mike Pence and Baptists do not actually send gays to brutal concentration camps to die. 

They do know that communists have a pretty consistent record of happily using gays if and when it suits their takeovers and then promptly killed, jailed or brutally persecuted gays 10 minutes after they get power. 

Castro's Cuba and how it treated gays .. wow.. I have read some pretty horrific shit including what can only be called psychological terror and torture, horrific long slow deaths through work punishments. My understanding is that part of that came about with the 'AIDS' epidemic and so without cash for treating that very expensive long term care they panicked and just started picking off gays like mad, including into mental hospitals, accusations of sedition etc, any criminal charges they could find or make up etc. 

In Canada, the Prime Minister takes his children to gay parades and hugs trannies for 'selfies' and does a 'gay parade' a week and then praises Castro like the guy was some hero. 
It really is fucking baffling.

As a Trump fan, I didn't like pence because of his anti-lgbt history. Has trump managed to change pence's mind?  Because that'd be amazing. 
This sub is starting to get a bit off track... 

I fully support  the US mending ties w/ Cuba for reasons that are obvious and it seems some people on this sub are determined to convince people that this is a bad idea.

I am a Trump supporter and I love certain things about this sub but honestly most posts seem like an overly aggressive attack and I don't see any intelligent discussion here. I am skeptical of the agendas on here and of a lot of the repeat posters. I know I will get downvoted but I want to make my voice heard.
You couldn't make it up mate. 
Honestly I haven't even seen one person in Canada who isn't happy about Castros death. And our leaders best friends with the guy.
What if Pence came out in support of Castro? WTH would the leftists do then?


Typical Liberal double standards. There so dumb.
The black activist football player who refuses to stand for our National Anthem but enjoys a great life here in the USA thinks Castro was a pretty good guy. Not likely the opinion he would hold were he to have had his family imprisoned and/or murdered and their property sized.

And our *lame* president, he dodged and simply said "history would judge" . . . 

WORD: History already *has*, and the verdict is **GUILTY of crimes against humanity!**
Seriously, Pence went to years of conversion therapy and is now the VICE PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  And now the libtards are like oh, Kim Jong Un is some great leader and shit.  Get the fuck out!!!!
Hypocrisy is had never been more open until this year with these brain dead leftist.
Some of the minority subreddits are praising Castro. Fucking hypocrites
No one is coming to take your gays.
its just too much for me man....
WTH, idiots?! Can we kick them off the edge of the world? 
Wait.. so.. you're telling me we're not supposed to be rounding up gays yet?  I already bussed like 50 of them to.. I mean *cough* hey kids look a racist!

Yes, he should.  The media are the democratic party and have assaulted Trump at every turn, they deserve no respect or traditional treatment.  This is a revolution of the American People.
He should *absolutely* do this. The press are just middlemen and, as we have clearly witnessed, they tend to get in the way. 
CNN headline:

Please god yes.
Quarterly AMAs with /r/The_Donald?
One great thing Trump could accomplish is demystifying the mainstream media a bit, showing them that they are just a group of people like any other... not impartial in the least who are completely devoid of integrity at this point.
If he is transparent, there won't be as many questions.  

Weekly/Monthly fireside chats.  3,5,10 year plans updated yearly.  Etc.
buh bye white house press corpse 
The President of the people without the media to filter the message. I like it!!
He should do citizen conference rallies
Live streaming AMA on the web. Watch the MSM spin what he says and catch crap from people who watched what he said. 

Presidential press conferences are boring. But a Presidential AMA? I would watch, hoping to see a stupid shithead question BTFO on a live stream. Remember the CTST vid when he was asked him if women would be paid the same as men? 

Don't think "fireside chat," these would be ringside chats. 
Guaranteed he will get more meaningful questions too, instead of "gotchya" nonsense. Best election ever becoming best presidency ever.
AMAs
Mr TRUMP!
Oh please let this happen.  I want to see media pundits outraged over the fact that Trump is showing the public how unnecessary they are. 
Also, the MSM has shown how out of touch they are by getting everything wrong. Why do we want them asking questions for us??

Bodyshaming only works on libtards

It's kind of like how they expect us to be triggered by "Drumpf" and "racist, sexist, homophobic" etc. It's because they're such thin-skinned pussies who fly into an impotent rage at name-calling, they expect that we are as well. When they post things like this and we just laugh and shrug it off, they are baffled.
Are they really that stupid to spam pictures of Trump to try to annoy us? 
We have the best funny pictures,  don't we folks

One of my favorite Trump pictures is that one where is face is all scrunched up and he looks like he is biting his lower lip and pointing his finger up in the air, you all probably know which one im talking about, the left uses it everywhere to make him look stupid, but I laugh everytime I see it because Trump has such an amazing memeable face!
What they don't realize is that this expression is at least 3-7% of the reason I voted for him.
These expressions are why I voted for him.

That, and the fact that I want liberals to suffer (in their minds) for the next 8 years. 
We have the best funny expressions!

Those look like debate photos where he was ripping on Jeb!
That's his BTFO face! üòÑüëè
Each one of these photos reminds me of some of the stupid things one of his opposers has said.  Followed by him abruptly shutting them down.  Just like the baseball pitcher's face just before he strikes your ass out with a 100 mph fastball down the middle.  
#THIS CONFIRMS KEK EMBODIES OUR GOD EMPEROR 
I make this face daily lol
If he didn't like seeing that face, then he wouldnt make that face. It's that simple.
Lol libtards are so out of touch probably because they have no friends. Sad!

He's so relatable and approachable. I love  this guy.
That's his "Bitch u thought!" Face 
How horrible!  Obviously he is literally making fun of disabled people who have no chin!  BRB, clutching pearls. 
Such a lovable goofball!
A real person.
I love we have such a unscripted president
The man is a walking kek memes,  just look at that handsome face!
The face after "Yeah because you'd be in jail" is priceless. He should of just dropped the mic.
"Somebody's doing the raping!" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
We'd all make this face if we realized what we were up against.
#GOOFUS!
These are some of his endearing and charismatic qualities. We like that he's and actual human unlike many politicians.
We love these pictures bigly
this guy is 70... holy fuck.. i wouldnt mind if he fucks my gf.. wouldnt mind to raise their sun like it was mine
That face you make at idiots when they think you hate your own face.

TRUMP: MAKING FACES GREAT AGAIN!
my face when browsing r/politics
love the donald
That's the best picture of him, whatchu talkin bout
Our new President makes the GREATEST faces, doesn't he folks?
I can see: "Are you fucking kidding me?"
I can see: "We've got a liar and a fruitcake here!"
I can see: "Bada-Bing-Bada-Boom! Get da fuck oudda here!"
I can see: "What a schmuck!"
I can see: "This one here is nuts!"
Just more 8D interstellar chess, get's his face plastered from other subs, I like these photos reminds me that he actually has a personality.
Lol even the liberals are succumbing to our SPICY memes
This is one of the proper ways to use GodEmporers "PFFFT" face. https://i.sli.mg/2PJWzP.jpg
At that statement I make the exact same face in response.
Pepe the frog impression.
I personally love this picture. It embodies"wtf" so well. 
The facial expression that says "I'm not even close to being tired of winning".
I love that face. He's doing that because he's trying to understand what the hell Jeb! Is yakking about.
BEAUTIFUL!

Not sure if Trump posed for the pics tho.
That face says, "Like I give a Shit!"
Don't blame Obama, for all of it.  Maybe it was Secretary of State ill Hillary Clinton who let them in.

Obviously, you can blame Obama for all of it, he was the fool who hired the fool to be Secretary.

He did vet them. That's why he was in Ohio.

As an Armenian American I hate this guy. The Armenian girl on her show is a fucking disgrace. I hope they see my comment. Fucking losers. Most Armenians I know voted for Trump!!! Fuck the liberals and their ideology 
*Armenian, OP.

Arminians are followers of Jacobus Arminius, a Dutch Theologian who disagreed with John Calvin's views on predestination claiming that free will does, in fact, exist, and our eternal fates are truly in our hands.

Armenians are people who live/lived in Armenia.
TYT named after Armenian genocide group? Someone explain. **Give me ammo for my liberal TYT watching dad**
Cenk knows his show is losing steam. He will have to go left even more and replace Ana with a newer, younger, hotter, less bitchy mouthpiece.
I've triggered so many Turks recently asking them about the Armenian genocide. They're fuckin' insane.
I never understood why they called themselves turks.
I used to be a big liberal in high school and a big watcher of TyT, and when we learnt about the real life Young Turks in history I was so confused. What an *awful* name for a web show.
My Great Great Grandfather was the only one in his family to escape the Armenian Genocide, they killed his family in front of him.
What a great picture.  It captures him to a T.  
The Democratic Party is the party of Racism and Sexism.  The elites know how dumb their followers are, and have brainwashed them.

1914‚Äì1917: Armenian Genocide[edit]
Main article: Armenian Genocide
The conflicts at the Caucasus Campaign, the Persian Campaign, and the Gallipoli Campaign affected places where Armenians lived in significant numbers. Before the declaration of war at the Armenian congress at Erzurum, the Ottoman government asked Ottoman Armenians to facilitate the conquest of Transcaucasia by inciting a rebellion among the Russian Armenians against the tsarist army in the event of a Caucasian Front.

Jakob K√ºnzler, head of a missionary hospital in Urfa, documented the large scale ethnic cleansing of both Armenians and Kurds under the Three Pashas during World War I.[15] He gave a detailed account of deportation of Armenians from Erzurum and Bitlis in the winter of 1916. The Armenians were perceived to be subversive elements (a fifth column) that would take the Russian side in the war. In order to eliminate this threat, the Ottoman government embarked on a large scale deportation of Armenians from the regions of Djabachdjur, Palu, Musch, Erzurum, and Bitlis. Around 300,000 Armenians were forced to move southwards to Urfa and then westwards to Aintab and Marash. In the summer of 1917, Armenians were moved to the Konya region in central Anatolia. Through these measures, the CUP leaders aimed to eliminate the Armenian threat by deporting them from their ancestral lands and by dispersing them in small pockets of exiled communities. By the end of World War I, up to 1,200,000 Armenians were forcibly deported from their home vilayets. As a result, about half of the displaced died of exposure, hunger, and disease, or were victims of banditry and forced labor.[16]

Around this period, the CUP's relationship to the Armenian Genocide shifted. Early on, Armenians had perceived the CUP as allies; and the beginnings of the Genocide, in the 1909 Adana massacre, had been rooted in reactionary Ottoman backlash against the Young Turks. But during World War I, the CUP‚Äôs increasing nationalism began to lead them to participate in the genocide. In 2005, the International Association of Genocide Scholars affirmed[17] that scholarly evidence revealed the CUP "government of the Ottoman Empire began a systematic genocide of its Armenian citizens and unarmed Christian minority population. More than a million Armenians were exterminated through direct killing, starvation, torture, and forced death marches."

Thanks for pointing this out. I have always wondered "why the hell did they choose that name"???

The young turds are garbage. 
Sink urger is a pile of shit liberal fascist. He supports the genocidal actions of yhe turks. I used to watch him and imo was not too bad in the past he actually did some good journalism. At some point a few years ago he went to hell.

He's nothing more than a fucking liberal.
Yea my great grandfather survived the Armenians genocide, and I honestly don't understand why he would name it that. It's like calling your news channel "The SS".
And are a fat fuck
In order to prove her point that only white people are bad, a relative told me that all those "other" genocides aren't as bad as the ones white people cause. Yet again, marginalizing victims of Rwanda, Cambodia, etc because they weren't killed by a white person. 

I'm very concerned about these people. I'm dumbfounded and I would like to sue whoever is responsible for this brainwashing.

Fuck those assclowns.  Armenian here.
their show lost so much reputation/viewership over this election - they're pretty much irrelevant now 
The only good thing to come out of TYT is the Rubin Report!  Dave was on TYT and split with them when they started to go full-blown SJW.  Dave Rubin is a fantastic example about what a journalist ought to be.  If you haven't seen his YouTube channel, it's worth a watch.

I fat-fingered a word and needed to correct, it took me a second to see that edit had been changed to spez.  HAHAHA!
The saddest thing of all is that 'Turks' form today's Turkey were previously Christian Greeks that have been genocided, hate fucked, indoctrinated and oppressed by Muslims to the point that they call themselves 'Turks'. If you went to 'Turkey' 650 years ago the area would be Christian and Greek speaking. 
Let's be honest, TYT went from being assholes to providing endless hours of entertainment. Seeing their coverage of the election night, in particular all of the youtubers that made a "greatest hits compilation" of that night.... I just don't get tired of watching that shit. The extreme level of butthurtness, and how Cenk tries to behave like a hard ass and make people believe he is going to "do something about it" is awesome lol. 
That is one punchable face.

>When I see Hillary Clinton, who we've talked about many times, getting on the bandwagon with flag burning, this is exactly what I said to you about Hillary every time you asked me. I said, she is the worst of both worlds. Because she is, I said, she's going to do exactly this, tack to the center. And she will win nobody, because the right wing is not fooled by this. They see Hillary Clinton coming out against flag burning, and they throw up because they see that is an opportunist who doesn't really believe it, and the left wing looks at it and just throws up.

If we ban flag burning there will be no videos of lefties getting 3rd degree burns from dancing on molten plastic

looks like you got another round of cry-ins and playdoh sessions

After realizing how easily they got played, now they are countering by suggesting to burn the confederate flag. 
Trump is the ultimate troll. 
After browsing the thread about this on the sub that shall not be named, the consensus seems to be that they want to start burning confederate flags in an attempt to bait trump supporters. Problem is no one gives a fuck about the confederate flag, a symbol of history past, we care about one thing only; THE GOD DAMN AMERICAN FLAG BITCHES!
Ultra spicy 
Up we go!
Stuff like this amazes me. Truly 4d chess
He didn't even propose anything. All he did was shit post his opinion on Twitter. That's the thing that's blowing my mind here. I disagree with his opinion, but I also realize it's a fucking shit post. 
This is why they want T_D banned to prevent stuff like this from getting their attention. So sorry. Hey r/All
You guys have got it all wrong! 

When Trump wants to make it illegal to burn flags it's a violation of the first amendment.

When Hillary wants to make flag burning illegal.. y'know I don't even have a good line for this because she's irrelevant. #NotMyPresident
Burning a rainbow flag is a hate crime but burning the USA flag is perfectly fine. 
How would they feel about burning the rainbow flag? Hate crime?
Trump is still wrong about this. Flag burning is an 1'st amendment issue. And you americans should have more respect for you 1'st because I live in a country where we have lost freedom of speech. 
I posted the Wikipedia link on the r/redacted page and I had some smart ass say something like "Okay? It was a stupid idea then too". I was like "Where was all the rage at Hillz in 2005?"
Just so we're clear on the stance of liberals here:

1. Burning the American Flag is protected under the 1st Ammendment as free speech and should not be infringed upon


2. Displaying the Confederate Flag is a symbol of hate and isn't protected by the 1st Ammendment and can't be allowed


Makes perfect sense.
Gotta love when liberals get played
why not post this into the hillary sub
I hope, one day, to reach the shitposting heights of the God Emperor.

It's hilarious how people think Trump doesn't know what he's doing with these tweets... He' baiting the crap out of them and you see right away all the MSM covering it. haha
Came for spilled tendies. Not disappointed.
I don't agree with Trump on this. Jail or losing citizenship for burning a flag? I might not like it but I would not harshly punish anyone for it, probably wouldn't punish at all. 

Yeah I get it, HRC also thinks the same way, but I think they're both wrong. 
Liberals always have double standards. It's okay if a liberal wants something. But NOT okay if someone with different views wants something. Liberals are a domestic threat to the American way of life.
Hillary Shills get the fuck out. 
I can imagine the madman up late at night after everyone is asleep. Computer glow on his face, still in a suit because work isn't done. He googles "laws hillary clinton sponsored." There are so many shit laws. This will be easy. "What will really throw these snowflakes off the deep end," Trump asks himself. "I know, I'll tweet positions that I really don't care much about but that kinda make sense, and that the left will absolutely lose their minds about." Trump builds an army of shitposts. "This will be great after I win in Nov." Trump, finally kinda tired at 1AM, sets his alarm for 3AM. An early Trump gets the snowflake.

Do you guys actually support banning flag burning?

Don't agree with either one. Freedom of speech and expression is vital to a free society. Doesn't matter if I or you like said speech. 
7400 upvotes despite constant downvote brigade!
Lib Suicide rate just shot up 10%
Two questions:

1) Environmentally, how can flag burning be a good idea?

2) Why is it legal to burn anything at a protest? 

This equation would fix this whole mess: Burning=Rioting=Felony
The left tries to disguise their hate and treason to their own country as "free speech". Its pretty sick. 
Im in 100% agreement with you guys that Clinton was pretty terrible. But you don't get to point to Clinton also being bad anymore. She lost, its over. Clinton is no longer politically relevant. Donald's proposed policies should be judged on their own merit now.
Hillary and Trump supporting this doesn't mean it's right though. It's about the freedom of speech and freedom to protest. 
So many triggered cucks here, so much winning.
Terribly researched, fake outrage. That's all we get from the 'opposition'. SAD!
I've noticed this is already starting to fall off my news feeds.  I guess they are starting to notice their ignorance and gullibility a little quicker these day.
If you wave a Mexican flag at a protest you should be charged with sedition.
People have the right to burn the flag and Trump has the right to say maybe they should be punished.  There can never be actual legislation on banning flag burning though as it is unconstitutional 
Sad! No one likes Hillary. This is one of many reasons why I didn't vote for her. Constitution above all else!
"I've always supported one get-out-of-jail-free card and a $100,000 reward for any protestor burning the flag" - Hillary Clinton, 2006

#HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Poor poor /r/enoughtrumpspam. Getting 4D into oblivion. 
I agree with everything you're saying, but I really hoped the election would mean I'd stop having to see this ugly horrible person's face on my newsfeed.  Hopefully she'll have a stroke soon and die and that's the last we can see of her.
Just because she was planning on doing it doesn't mean liberals supported that either. It's fucking stupid no matter who does it. Can anyone here understand that or...
I searched for "Hilary" on that 6k+ upvoted thread on r/all and can't find any mention to this, the amount of hillary bots on reddit is insane..

I believe in freedom of speech. I don't care who said it, it's wrong.

First time I've been (slightly) disappointed with Mr. Trump. But eh, I'll get over it. We still have to MAGA.
Facts and the truth are distressing to liberals!!
What I don't get is this: If I go out in the street and burn a cardboard box, or a tire, or anything else, someone will call the cops. Then I will get arrested or at least cited. Why do protesters (rioters) have free rein to burn flags or anything else? I'm pretty sure there are general laws that cover setting fire to stuff in public.
This did reach r/all, but now it's gone from it.

It was THE top of r/all, and now it's gone.

Cool, so they're both wrong .. but one of them is our president now, so I think I'm going to grill him a little harder and point out unconstitutional things he says. Pointing to Hillary's pitfalls doesn't negate Trump's. The election is over, and this rhetoric is no longer even useful. 
I think we should revoke visas over flag burning (interfering with the political process, not being here in good faith), but citizens should be allowed to be stupid fucks. 
Have to disagree with Donald and Hillary here.  It is free speech and covered by the first amendment, which we must realize is designed to protect all speech, especially political speech.  Especially speech that we may find offensive and unpopular.  Remember that many people find Trump supporters to be offensive so the attacks we allow on free speech now could easily be turned against us in the future.  Besides the Supreme Court already settled this issue.  #MAGA
To all you absolutely CLUELESS liberal imbeciles who do not understand what a democracy is;

The man is simply exercising HIS freedom of speech over something that could be overruled TOMORROW. 
Flag burning was not always protected under the first amendment. You imbeciles clearly have no fucking clue what you're angry about anymore. By your imbecile standards, libel and slander should be permitted.

Discussing your thoughts on possibilities of certain actions is NOT fascism or stupid. We will debate a million times on what our constitution protects and doesn't protect. 

And to those complaining about his tweeting, DO fuck off immediately. I didn't vote for some groomed politician who speaks in a politically correct tone to appease you liberal communists.

They are just going to ignore this though. "She lost, you can't point fingers at her anymore!"

...Accept this this was proposed by her in 2005, 11 whole years ago, and not one peep from the cucks about it. This is an actual piece of legislation that would have put actual people in jail, that was sponsored by an actual person in power.

If you feel like burning the flag of the country you currently live in, it's time for you to move out. Otherwise, leave it be and do what I do:

#***[Buy one of these stickers!](https://www.amazon.com/Anti-Hillary-Clinton-Presidential-Election/dp/B00Y7BL5KM/ref=pd_sim_201_3/157-5200746-5305011?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00Y7BL5KM&pd_rd_r=2X5FCCF3DF5BFHSNYSD9&pd_rd_w=1rJXW&pd_rd_wg=xew5S&psc=1&refRID=2X5FCCF3DF5BFHSNYSD9)***

Trust me. You'll feel much better ever time you have to go.
If someone is burning the flag, anyone should be able to just shoot them, similar to if someone invaded your house and is trying to destroy it, just like a flag burner is doing to the USA. Just make sure you get a video of them setting it on fire, and/or holding it while it's on fire.

If Trump had put his tweet in quotes and had a link they still wouldn't get it.

uh, isn't hillary irrelevant as fuck since she lost?
I grew up a boy scout and if the flag ever touched the ground you had to take a year off, and live with Tibetan monks for a year while saying 100 hail marys a day, and then had to pass a citizenship test to come back to the states. 
Have to say, I support Trump but not a ban on flag burning. I'm a hardliner on free speech. 
"If the flag needs protection at all, it needs protection from members of Congress who value the symbol more than the freedoms that the flag represents." 

--U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D - NY

Flag burning is an incredibly disrespectful act. Should it be illegal? Probably not; we prize our freedoms, including those relating to self-expression. It's funny, however, how leftist will go far out of the way to keep from possibly offending any random person ("my pronouns are ze, xin, Schwimmer, and serendipity. I identify as a railroad track. I get offended easily. Notice me!"), but they don't have any issue offending those in our military. I just think if you are going to infringe on personal rights in order to preserve the feelings of a group, your stance on every issue should mimic that belief. Liberals, you can't just cherry pick whose feelings are important.
All this proves to anyone is that Hillary is not a liberal. If you're being told Hillary is a liberal you're watching fake news.
I am an American Patriot in my federal civilian job, and also in the military reserves,  but believe people should be able to burn the flag freely. They will be shitbags in my eyes and never receive any personal help from me, but it is their right and the definition of American freedom.
Wasn't there a supreme Court case that found flag burning protected by the first amendment? If my memory serves me right, a constitutional amendment would be needed.
trump is wrong on this though, yes, its a very disrespectful thing to do, but you shouldn't have to go to jail for it
Heads up, we dont like Hillary either.

Trump is annihilating the media and ignorant populous with his 4D chess techniques. The God Emperor Shitposter Strikes Again!

It's like arguing with adolescents. Due to their personal political bias, the liberal media shines a light on some propped up jobless, or entitlement baby outrage.  These outrages range from something either racist or unfair because of Trump statement, position, or facial expressions.  To make things worse, every time the facts disprove their crap, the media, rather than retract this contrived propaganda, they just move on to another inane accusation. It truly defines the difference in TV Broadcaster and journalist.  Pathetic, truly pathetic...
I fucking love it.

Shitposting this fine brings a tear to my eye.  How the hell does anyone take the bit about removing citizenship and deporting them seriously?  What, are we going to start sending shitheads to australia?  Maybe the arctic?  How do you get so good that idiots bite on it?  It's a beautiful thing.
Oh, this is so perfect.

LOL.
It's disgusting how much freedom we have in this country and yet people still find shit to bitch about.
Thing is, I disagree with Trump as I believe it is protected free speech - however - I think you are kinda thick if you thought Trump is saying this should be actual policy or law.  
Trump is a master troll, every tweet is tossing a bone to the mainstream media to dig a hole, once in the hole he pulls out the ladder. Can't wait.  
Either way it's still bullshit. No matter how much you disagree with the act of setting a flag on fire, it's still freedom of expression. Nobody ever died because somebody set their flag on fire, it's the act of sticking it to the establishment which is why Clinton wanted it to be illegal. Trump is supposed to be anti-establishment, so I'm struggling to understand why he wants to make it illegal, unless if he just said it on the whim. Wouldn't be the first time he's done something like that, and since he's not tied to any special interests, he's actually flexible and make decisions based on what the people want....
This bill only applied to people who were burning the flag as an act of intimidation--not as a simple protest act. 
Don't you guys realize that it's not about Hillary vs Trump anymore? It doesn't surprise me that Hillary sponsored a bill like this, I personally don't like her and I know a majority of Reddit agrees with me. This is about whether or not a ban on flag burning violates freedom of speech, which it does. I think burning the American flag is terrible. Our flag represents what so many men and women have died to protect, and it should always be revered, no matter how much you disagree with our government. However, you can't punish someone for burning it, they have the right to do whatever they want with their property. The fact that trump is trying to ban a form of peaceful protest has nothing to do with Hillary, it's just wrong.
Jesus, there's so much hypocrisy with libtards it's hard to tell if they're even serious 
Yup. Shitty when she did it too. I'm not seeing how that excuses Trump though. Pointing to the other side to distract from faults is classic political bullshit. So much for the outsider.
If you bought it, you should be allowed to burn it, right? Especially if it's just some cloth on a stick. Go ahead and let protesters waste their money. I mean, flag burning ban or not, they're still going to protest shit.
Burning a flag itself isnt the issue for me, but rather as a tool to protest.
By burning a us flag in protest of the us, your own nation, you're basically condemning the very nation that made what you're doing possible.
A flag is a symbol, it's the identity of a nation. I see it as a representation of everything a nation stands for.
So by burning a flag to protest ONE thing you disagree with, you reject everything else a nation stands for.

I mean, i'm all for the Trump train (been riding for about a year now), but punishing people for burning fabric that may be their own property.... 

Come on guys. He's wrong on this one.

Burning a flag is burning fabric. Burning what the flag represents is like burning an idea, it cannot be done and causes no harm to what is represented.
Cognitive dissonance intensifies. 
And guess what no matter who said it's still stupid. The fact that it's the soon to be president who said it within the last 24 hours, is horrifying.
don't care who sponsored it, its a dumb policy.

You can't force respect, you can only force people to pretend respect. Freedom means your free to be disrespectful, even if people here find it abhorrent. 
Just because Hillary also wanted this doesn't make him any less wrong.

OK guys, I have to disagree with you on this. I'm a bit of an absolutist on 1st and 2d Amendments and as much as I hate see the American Flag burned I believe it's a right protected under the First Amendment and is not to be infringed. So I disagree with President-Elect Trump's plans on this.
Cool, Trump and Hillary have something in common.
Trump is playing 12D interdimensional chess while Reddit is playing checkers.   Sad! 
Good thing Clinton isn't president elect.
If trump comes out and says gay marriage should be illegal, you can't come out and cite hillary saying she was against it a while ago. 

I dont give a fuck what hillary said, shes an evil bitch and im glad she lost but this is about trump now not her. 

I seriously hope he was trying to trigger liberals because imprisoning people for flag burning is not okay and he's wrong for saying it
I'm gonna go ahead and say that, in this case, it's just "whataboutism". 

Banning flag burning is an absolute abridgement of the first amendment, and would almost certainly never pass a SCOTUS challenge.

It's silly for any politician to propose it. 

Edit: Also, OP will want to include a [link to the bill Clinton sponsored so everyone knows he's not just someone making shit up.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005) 
Except the 'God Emperor' proposed revocation of citizenship as punishment, which is... ya know... unconstitutional.
This was stupid too.  Does that make it OK for Donald to do?  Is being like Hillary really a good thing?
Haha Trump clearly knew they'd be outraged over this.
Ha ha ha ha!

Here's how you work around the first amendment: pass a law saying all American flags must be made if non-flammable materials!

Safety first! Think of the children!
Can we get a rider for any bill that's proposed that includes a $100,000 reward for burning a Mexican flag? Pretty sure it's the reconquista tools that burn the most American flags. 
trump is obviously shitposting at SC primary levels now. there are already laws against causing fires in cities. he's just triggering libtards right now

Well you can see the confusion of liberals: since the Republican congress voted against this bill. After they voted against it, they will now pretend (the Republicans) that it was their idea. No wonder liberals are confused. I'm conservative and I'm confused. Still not clear where Republicans (I'm a conservative, not a Republican)-- actually stand on the flag burning issue. They've controlled congress for 8 years.

It is hate speech, Hillary wanted to ban this! so they whine about Hate speech.

How do they even find these things? We have the best people working for us surely
Burning the flag is protected under the first amendment, isn't it? I think there was a supreme court ruling that determined that.
Neither should.
I'm glad that Trump continues to discredit the mainstream media in this time where they're doubling down on their own idiocy
Haha, Trump continues to prove his elite trolling ability. Even funnier, is a lot of people are point at the absurdity of the left wing media praising this dictator Castro, and now they are going to see them, thanks to Trump, bend over backwards to rationalize how flag burning and America hating is a healthy and wonderful part of freedom of speech and how Trump is a fascist.

Flag burning is an extremely unpopular form of protest. If you want people to NOT be on your side, then burn a US flag. 

The ultimate troll of it all is that Hillary proposed this exact same thing, yet where was the outrage? So, if they try to call Trump a fascist, they can instantly shut down the argument with, "Have you called Hillary a fascist as well?"
"STUMPED!"
God she is ugly
I think we need protect an American's right to burn the US flag. Its not hurting anyone. It shouldn't be illigal to be an asshole.
This is one of the few cases where I disagree with Trump.
While this is one of the few things Trump has said that I'm completely against, this is absolutely amazing. 
How do they keep taking his bait?
Do you think people agreed with that sentiment just because it was dem(hilldawg) sponsored? Do you think all people follow their leaders as blindly as the_Donald follows trump?  Burning the flag should be a protected act no matter who does it.  There should always be strong opposition to ppl trying to take our rights away. And this isn't the first time trump has made anit-1st amendment statements.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005

> The Flag Protection Act of 2005 was a proposed United States federal law introduced by Senators Bob Bennett (R-UT) and **Hillary Clinton** (D-NY). The law would have prohibited burning or otherwise destroying and damaging the US flag with the primary purpose of intimidation or inciting immediate violence. It called for a punishment of one year in jail and a fine of $100,000.[1][2][3]
Trump sure knows how to play them lefties:  get the to burn the flag in protest, further alienating them, AND expose their hypocrisy.  These are going to be very fun 8 years.  
When Trump said we would get tired of winning, I thought he was just using hyperbole.
How about we just put flag burners on the terrorist watch list, then when they go to take vacation they can't get on a plane...?
Ahhh gold. Pure gold.

Why cant I see this on r/all when it has more votes?

EDIT: ok I can see it on all, must have been a glitch.
It just shows multiple people in power have thought of doing this, doesn't make it a good idea.

Love President Trump and my fellow centipedes, and I personally would never burn our flag and think people who do are fucking scum.  But I believe as the supreme court upheld that it falls under our freedom of speech and hate the idea making flag burning a criminal act. 

Build the wall, deport the muslims, drill baby drill, but let the hippies burn our flag while we do it. 
I don't understand why this helps validate Trump's statements, as I feel a lot of us on Reddit disagree with both of these peoples' viewpoints. Essentially, how the hell does Hillary Clinton's political past make ME a hypocrite if I don't/didn't support her or her policies either?

Bottom line is, fuck both of these people. I was raised to treat our Nation's flag AND constitution with respect. I would never burn the flag, I would do my best to convince someone not to do it, but I sure as hell want our government to respect our constitutional right to freedom of speech in all of its forms. 
"Any person who shall intentionally threaten or intimidate any person or group of persons by burning, or causing to be burned, a flag of the United States shall be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both."
  The proposed ban was specifically against burning a flag to incite violence. Chilling in your own back yard and burning a flag to keep the fire going would have still been perfectly legal under the Flag Protection Act of 2005.
  https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/1911/text
American Flags are typically made of nylon, polyester, or cotton. All it takes is an act of congress deeming that burning these materials in public causes damage to public health and to the environment.

Your move, liberals.
In my opinion, liberals should still be outraged about this as well. 


Not a huge fan immediately of taking away the principle of flag burning, but at the same time if anyone tries to excuse Hillary for this, while speaking out against Trump, they are hypocrites.
This isn't a Hillary vs trump issue, it's a freedom of speech issue. If you can't burn the flag because people think it's to deplorable to do, then that opens the door to take away more. The whole point of free speech is to protect the people who say thing you may not agree with.
>be American

>burn the American flag

And they wonder why anybody with any sense doesn't respect or take liberals seriously.

You should never burn the flag of the country you live in. Shameful.
Absolutely baffled at how hard these people keep failing, it's like every single time they say a bad thing about Trump it comes back to bite them on the ass and they look like fools. 

I wonder if they will ever get tired of losing. 
If anti-Trump crybabies make burning flags an anti-Trump symbol, then that just locks down patriotic Americans in our column for a long time to come.
Democrats and republicans are honestly all the same
Don't see how this makes Trumps proposed ban any better? 

Pre-emptive edit: Remember, free speech means protecting speech you find offensive! A cursory glance at constitutional law would illuminate one to this. 
the only people that seem to burn the flag are total degenerates. A ban/severe fine is just what we need
It seems like the Madman is using his Twitter to start/guide conversation.
"However, the bill's language was designed so as to prohibit the desecration of a flag when the intent was found to be a threat to public safety, the intention being that it would therefore not violate the¬†First Amendment¬†and not be declared unconstitutional.[5]

Both co-sponsors of the bill voted against the¬†Flag Desecration Amendment¬†of 2006."
For those interested, this is a classic "tu quoque" fallacy. While it may be true that HRC endorsed a bill banning flag burning, it doesn't change the fact that Trump is also threatening to ban flag burning.

https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/tu-quoque

Another way to think about this is "Look, Trump is no worse than HRC!" Hardly a compelling argument...
yeah, and the repeal of glass stangall caused the recession, but shhh, it was all bush's fault. 
Only it does not say "for any protestor burning the flag".

It specifically names circumstances for which the act would be punishable, and all of those circumstances involve causing harm to people -- not just anyone who burns a flag. It would NOT have  criminalized burning your own flag in protest, as Donald Trump wants to do. Had it passed, this bill would not have been in conflict with the first amendment. 

You can read the full text here (it's only a single page) -- https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/1911/text
She's clearly changed her opinion on the matter... just like every other major issue...
No one sitting behind a computer for the MSM was an adult in 2005.... let that sink in....
Can't we all be mad that either of the "politicians" would suggest something so anti free speech?

I don't care if HRC or D_T suggests it, it's a fucking terrible idea.
FUCK YOUR FEELINGS,IF YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA AND WANT TO BURN SOME FLAGS GTFO TRUDEAU REALLY WANTS SOME BRAINWASHED LIBS RN
This act wasnt intended to prevent people from burning thew flag. Read the proposed bill. 

Flag Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; (2) intentionally threatening or intimidating any person, or group of persons, by burning a U.S. flag; or (3) stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag belonging to the United States, or belonging to another person on U.S. lands, and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag.
Did you also know it's possible that I can disagree with DT and HRC on an issue? No one should be jailed/fined for burning the flag. Have any of you heard of the First Amendment? 

Fining/jailing someone over burning the flag isn't a protecting anyone or anything. It's merely a gross display of governmental power - essentially a statement that they will imprison you and take away your freedom for a harmless act (burning any other piece of cloth in your own home isn't necessarily dangerous and definitely not illegal). 

Also, I think it needs to be made clear that I'm not advocating or condoning people who indeed decide to burn the flag. Yes it's disrespectful. People are completely missing the issue if they're arguing about whether it's disrespectful or not to burn the flag.

So let's think critically here. Once the government begins imposing prison sentences for any displays of subversiveness to government and Americanism, it becomes a slippery slope real quickly.  If anyone wants to have a thoughtful discussion about this, I'm definitely open to that. 
It still doesn't make Donald right in saying that.
Why does this still come up? The supreme court ruled pretty decisively on this one. Flag burning is a for of protected speech.
She was for it before she was against it.
I guess I don't speak for all liberals, but I support ideas not people. So regardless of who proposed this ban on flag burning, i would have been opposed. 
These cucks are impressively ignorant.

How does one manage to be so opinionated with so little understanding of the world. Perhaps it's a chicken/egg situation.

As many, I would be more disgusted if you couldn't burn the flag.  

That said, if you're burning a the American flag, the root of the problem probably lies in you.  Also, you can't undo burning a flag, that's on your soul forever.

  
I think burning the flag is in poor taste, but these fines and punishments are ridiculous.
Burning the flag is a protected form of free speech unless it has a direct purpose to intimidate or threaten a particular individual or group. 
Still doesn't make it right.
So how this is relevant in any way. Just because Clinton said something similar, it doesnt justify what trump said..

Clinton was supporting a violation of our constitution by sponsoring that bill, and Trumps statements are no different in the message. Looking forward, I find this to be worrisome and Clintons past to be irrelevant. Trump is the one waiting to take office as our next president and he should be judged for that alone, and not in comparison to what his previous campaign opponent said in the past
Why are people DEFENDING burning a flag?

I mean, why would you ever want to burn a flag?

Never burnt a flag in my life (of any country/group) and I'm doin' alrite.
Look. I made an account just to say this. I don't know if this is some kind of chess move, but I wish we could all just calm the fuck down for a minute and stop comparing him to her. I know it's a circle jerk in here, but HRC lost. She's done. She doesn't get to run anymore. We have to stop placing the blame on her because Hillbots are finished. They're either going to have to jump on the Trump train, fight him without Hillary, or move onto another candidate. Yeah, she did this in 2005, but we also know she was against gay rights in 2012. To compare her to Donald is a shame. Stop it. Stop pushing the blame on the other side every time he says something dumb. It's so childish to point at the opposition and yelling "BUT SHE DID IT TOO!" Just stop. It makes us look petty and weak. 
We need to meme the fuck out of flag burning=hate speech because right now the unnamed sub is circlejerking about free speech, as if they have been long time libertarians.

Hillary Clinton would later go on to vote against the Flag Desecration Amendment of 2006.
Clinton believes in nothing. I'm not sure what Trump believes in. 

Both sort of scare me. 
He's playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers. His troll game is strong. He's exposing the hypocrisy. It's brilliant.
It was also a terrible and unconstitutional idea when Hillary co-sponsored that bill.
This is the first I've heard of it, and I would oppose such a ban.  What does it actually protect or prevent? Nothing.  Its silly.  No.  I cannot condone taking a person's freedoms away and locking them in a cell for burning an image. 

Let the muslim countries do that shit.  Not the USA
anti free speech, sounds like something trump & clinton would support
What a stupid post. Why should we care that Hillary has this horrible position on flag burning? If Trump has the same or a similar position, then I would be worried about him violating our rights to freedom of speech because he will have presidential power.
It's a dumb idea no matter who is proposing it, a waste of time and effort that would be needed to enforce it. 
Well... can't we say that both are wrong? Hillary Clinton is a pretty low standard to have. 
Regardless of where it comes from, this is a bad thing to legislate.

The last the America needs is another victimless crime on the books.

If this is another of Big Don's A/B tests, I think we should make our voices heard on it!
Perhaps it is possible to dislike them both over this issue. The 1st amendment was put in 1st for a reason, and anybody chipping away at it deserves major backlash. Regardless of who they are.
So, many people here think that deflecting the notion of the infringement of the FIRST AMENDMENT to Hillary supporting it 11 years ago is somehow making what Trump said okay? You realize that not all liberals and leftists supported Hillary, right? It isn't a black and white issue. Get off your fucking high horses.
you know... she's not running for president anymore... or are you saying you agreed with hillary?

Yep, this just hit /r/all.

NO BRAKES!
Still can't support rights being taken away.
If you believe or support everything your candidate says or believes than you are just a sheep anyways 
Okay, I usually don't comment on anything other than r/funny, but I am seriously concerned. Why is this a good thing? Why are any of you so excited about this? I get that you're dominating Reddit and stuff, I don't really care, it's a free website and it honestly doesn't matter, but why on earth would you support this? Real talk
It's almost as if liberals didn't support her because she wasn't one.  
I don't think it's as much about flag-burning as it is about his comment about revoking citizenship. 
So you're saying the candidate you elected is at least as bad as Hillary Clinton? I fail to see your point here.
Let's not use Hillary's past words to prove that Trump's goal is sound.  We all despise flag burners, but we also want The Constitution upheld.  I don't like what they do, but the idiots have the right to do it.  Let's not support any kind of legislation that would hinder our freedom of speech/expression.  If we do, the next step is more laws that hinder our 2nd Amendment under the next Democrat regime.
I think it's the part about loss of citizenship in his comment that is the most disturbing and not so much imprisonment.
What does HRC co-sponsoring an un-constitutional bill in 2005 have to do with DT promoting an un-constitutional idea in 2016? Because they're the same idea? 
There's a reason both of these candidates were considered shit. This is one of them. 
actually on the front page. 

Honestly though, flag burning is done in many places across the world and is seen as a way to express opinion. Isn't it constitutionally protected ?
The Donald agrees with shillary. The Donald are a bunch of cucks. It has come full circle. 
yeah, Donald Trump should not ban flag burning, and neither should Hillary Clinton have tried to in 2005. It's pretty well covered from past Supreme Court decisions that flag burning is protected under the first amendment, so if they did pass a law banning it, it would be overturned as unconstitutional. 
So because Hillary did it, It's fine that Trump wants to also? I don't understand.
Freedom of speech? Let's take a page from the liberal playbook and classify flag burning as "hate speech".

;-)
Idc who's behind it. I'm completely against that
Are we allowed to not agree with either? I think it is abhorrent and wrong to do.  I also don't want the government restricting speech any more than they already do. 
You should have every right to burn the flag, this isn't a fascist nation.
Hillary being a piece of shit isn't a shield for Trump being a piece of shit anymore. She's out of the picture and Trump is the president-elect. I'm sure this community, as well as independents who didn't support either Trump or Hillary, strongly value free speech. And you know what? I'm willing to bet a majority of Hillary supporters valued free speech as well and were either ignorant of her positions on flag burning or thought it wasn't an issue that mattered because the people will ultimately oppose draconian, unconstitutional laws.

Trump is being reactionary here without thinking through the implications, and instead of holding Trump accountable to your ideals of free speech and having faith that he will come around to those ideals in the end, this community is basically deflecting valid criticism with the extremely low bar of Hillary's actions. If you want to paint Hillary supporters as hypocrites, fine, but if you are coming down on the wrong side of the issue and support the erosion of the first amendment just to do that then that becomes a problem. 


So burning the American flag is ok to them but what if I burned the lgtbq flag? Hate crime? 
#LIBERALS HAVE A MENTAL DISORDER LOL
... The elections are over already. If your only defense for Trump saying stupid shit is that Clinton said stupid shit too, you have mixed priorities. Clinton's retiring from politics. Trump is your president elect.
Hillary's not running anymore, she was a lousy candidate but she's not going to be president. So stop using her as a shield to deflect the fact that Trump is anti-free speech.
[removed]
So what if she said it. She is not relevant anymore.
As an average guy who loves Trump and isn't very patriotic:

How can anyone really defend burning your country's flag?

What does it accomplish? What positive things can come out of that? And is that really the best way to express your opinion on something?
It would never effect me, but outlawing flag burning is the same thing as gun control in concept, a limit on a freedom that makes no sense. I like a lot of Trump's ideas, but this is one I am against.
How does this make it better? If you want to burn a flag you should be able to. 
I get that people think "Burning a flag is free speech." 

But burning the flag is so disrespectful. I remembered when I went to school you didn't even let the flag touch the ground, even for a second. 
Did anyone read the bill? Trump wants to tacitly imprison flag burners for any reason (such as protest), whereas the bill being linked here is intended to prevent violence, etc:

Flag Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; (2) intentionally threatening or intimidating any person, or group of persons, by burning a U.S. flag; or (3) stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag belonging to the United States, or belonging to another person on U.S. lands, and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag.
she's not the President
What is so bad about a flag burning ban? It's not like that it takes the freedom of speech away, there are other ways to express your opinoin. 
Besides burning something can be dangerous!

Sometimes I have the feeling that people complain about something, just because they like complaining.
Shit, this is 100% true. It even has its own WP page.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005

Even the NYTimes called her out:

http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/07/opinion/senator-clinton-in-pander-mode.html
One of the most inspirational things I've ever seen was a protest of flag burners that were confronted by some biker Marines. The way they practically shit their pants and ran when confronted by people who actually fought for this country was amazing.  
So are we agreeing that this is bad policy then? Because Hillary's irrelevant now, and Donald is the president. Not sure why anyone's still talking about her.
It is a bit ridiculous and against small government (and possibly free speech) to make flag burning illegal...
Well he is the President-Elect and she isn't. Her positions don't matter. Both proposals are fascist.
Yep. Hillary is pretty much just as awful as Trump on this issue.
Do you guys not realize this isn't about Hilary anymore?
[removed]
I would vote for this 
Man, Hillary is just as cucked as Bernie. Go where the money takes you!
It's a genious move because it will cause more liberals to burn more American flags making them look like the anti American party even more so
Would certainly be a shame....

*clicks up vote button*
another teaching moment 4 liberals that their candidate isn't who they thought she is.  Its time 2 Unite liberals.  Donald J Trump loves you!  MAGA!
God they are fucking stupid. 
They walk right into it every time.

I don't really get the intended point here. So Hillary Clinton is wrong too. What does that have to do with anything?

You might have noticed that the election is over. Pointing out Hillary Clinton's faults is no longer a viable deflection tactic.

Just because someone agrees with Donald Trump doesn't mean that they agree with or support Hillary Clinton. Honestly the only people who care about this post reaching the front page are the people who upvoted it there, most other people couldn't care less.

Clinton [opposed the latest Flag Desecration Amendment](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/109-2006/s189) in 2006. Her latest stance seems to be in support of free speech when it comes to flag burning. Interestingly, Sessions (the incoming Attorney General) supported the Flag Protection Act as well.
Even if Hillary did sponsor that act, it doesn't really change the threats or implications of Trump's stance on burning the flag. Sure some people are being hypocritical about it, but the validity of those statements are still there
And the same people would have been angry. You guys are fucking stupid.
So you guys agree this is a bad idea, right?
That doesn't make this okay! They're both wrong! 
He made the comment about it to start a media frenzy showing their hypocrisy. Top tier Trump trolling!
It reached top of /all.

The poor cucks don't know what to do with themselves.
I don't support either. It's fully protected by Free speech.

And I hated hillary before you say anything
They are both wrong. 
Why the fuck are the liberals of Reddit freaking out over this? /r/pol is a fucking mess right now.
I didn't know Hillary was the president elect. Huh, TIL
Why are you still obsessed with Hillary? Donald is already the president elect...
Not a single person in here is gonna mention that he said people who burn the flag should go to jail OR  lose their citizenship? People are reacting to punishment by loss of citizenship

https://www.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/803567993036754944
As a Swede, I do not think it should be illegal to burn a bit of cloth under controlled circumstances.

Yeah. Symbolism is strong, still a piece of fabric. And being offended by a non-violent act, is exactly ehat I am so annoyed about thr libtards being all the time.

I am fully aboard the Trump-train. Does not mean I like evrery single thing, so go easy on the hate :)
so because hillary wanted to do it, it means its right? isnt this sub for trump?
But she's not President.
So does trump want to protect the flag? I really respect that
this really doesn't make it better it just says that both candidates where shite.
Who said reddit agrees with either of them?
FREEDOM OVER EVERYTHING FUCK THEM BOTH IF THEY MAKE LAWS AGAINST FREEDOM. MY MAGIC TO STRONG FOR THESE CHAINS.
I do not think the Flag Protection Act of 2005 applies to any protestor burning the flag. The summary text reads:

Flag Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; (2) intentionally threatening or intimidating any person, or group of persons, by burning a U.S. flag; or (3) stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag belonging to the United States, or belonging to another person on U.S. lands, and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag.
Pushing down the other side does not lift you. There are plenty of Americans who are not fans of either Trump or Clinton, and of the ones that are, it's still possible to vote for or like a candidate and criticize a particular policy. 
Reddit is not all pro-Trump or pro-Hillary.
Just because Hillary agrees doesn't justify it... You realize people can be against Hillary *and* Trump, right?
"...with the primary purpose of intimidation or inciting immediate violence or for the act of terrorism."

You dullards conveniently left that part out.
Yeah, this is one of many reasons why voters on the left despise HRC.  If you guys don't understand why this is so dangerous, un-American, and unconstitutional, then you don't understand what this country was founded on.  **It has absolutely NOTHING to do with defending flag burning, and I abhor it.**  It's about freedom.  Once the whittling away of freedom starts, it won't stop.  This is EXACTLY what enemies of our great country want us to do; give up our freedom piece by piece, a little bit more each time.  

And what does this accomplish?  Does it bring jobs back to the U.S.?  Does it raise stagnant wages?  Does it reduce the national debt?  Does it improve our crumbling infrastructure?  Does it give millions of Americans access to health care they wouldn't have otherwise?  Does it get money out of politics?  No.  The fact of the matter is, Trump now has to be held to a high standard in regards to fixing these and so many other issues.  He doesn't have a lot of political capital,  so he needs to focus on the bigger picture in order to get things done.  This is not a good use of that capital.  

This is irrelevant just because one idiot agrees with another doesn't make it  a good idea. It also seems like he's trying to appeal to establishment republicans who gives a shit if you burn a flag?
So what who proposed it first, it proves he is against the first amendment.  Do you guys honestly support this, or is it just because trump said it you are jumping on the bandwagon?
What if i told you i can dislike Hillarys ban on the flags aswell as trumps? Just cuz i dislike Trump doesnt mean i like Hillary, j√§nkare...
This is simply a shortened version of the 2005 bill. You left out the whole "with the purpose of inciting a riot or instigating violence" part. Both of which are already against the law. It's harder to take Trump's tweet out of context. I'm not a fan of Hillary, but isn't this post a little partisan?
I'm pro trump, but this is sadly one of the things I disagree with him about. Flag burning of any kind is in my opinion another freedom of speech. We don't want to the government having any more power than it already has. 
The thing is, what Hillary did or said or sponsored is no longer relevant. She lost, Trump and his ideas have to stand on their own now. 

How long are you guys going to whine about what Hillary would have said or done? When trump is 4 years into his presidency? 
To be fair the flag protection act didn't prohibit burning the flag all together... it only prohibited it in the context of inciting violence. Still potentially violating first amendment though 
two wrongs don't make a right, dipshit

i was a big supporter of this sub during the primaries but lately the circlejerk has reached critical mass and it's completely insufferable. learn to admit when you're wrong.
It was retarded when Hillary supported it, and it's still retarded now that Donald is supporting it.

This post doesn't make a very good point. All liberals disagree with say, Hillary's vote on the Iraq war; doesn't mean they'd ever vote for Trump. Doesn't mean someone isn't stupid for trying to argue that that was a wise vote.

Nobody was supporting Hillary because of her stance on flag-burning, because she had a retarded stance. Trump echoing that same stance today doesn't make it any less retarded.
Sorry guys, but I'm not on the same page with Trump on this at all. He's going to have to rethink that Tweet.

You don't have to agree with flag burning, but there have already been Supreme Court decisions establishing that it is a legitimate form of protest covered under the First Amendment. If gay marriage is done and dusted according to Trump because the SC decided on it, why is flag burning any different?

IMO Hillary sponsoring the same thing isn't a good argument that this is an okay thing to go after. We already know she's shit.
Just because clinton's also bad doesn't mean trump's faultless?
Wtf even is this argument

"HRC (who we dislike) did X, so if our president-elect does X it's OK"

Fuck that logic, fuck this idea. Burning flags is a sacred american right. 


Instead of making it illegal to burn the flag how about lifting the sentence for me beating your ass if you do.

Go ahead and burn the flag but be ready to face a few veterans and bikers if you do.
Have we suddenly ended up back before the Republican primaries?

Who actually gives that many fucks about locking people up for doing something that's merely childish and stupid?
You can't keep comparing Trump to Clinton. They are no longer opponents in an election. Trump is president elect. He has to be able to stand on his own, not lean on what someone else said ten years ago to make himself look better. He's president, as much as I hate it, and he needs to start acting like it. 
Is it fake news that he said it or that she proposed something similar? I'm kinda unclear on that. Personally I disagree with the burning of flags, not standing during the anthem or kids refusing to say the pledge in school. I think it's kinda unpatriotic, and while you can disagree/dislike the government you should respect the troops, and the country itself. That being said I think a lay to punish people for this is a violation of the first amendment. A law shouldn't tell you to not burn the American flag, common sense and the general desire to not be a cunt should. My brothers deployed to the Middle East right now as I type this, and I hate seeing the flag disrespected but it'd be a shame if the constitution was superseded just to do it.
I wonder, is it still freespeech to be against free speech and burn the constitution and flag? It's like the tolerance thing, the tolerance of the intolerance. Up to debate, little word on it tho, almost all western countries implement a fine on burning the national flag on a public space. Some, like Israel and Mexico, can make you go to jail, it is after all, the ultimate insult to a country.
> New York Times DEC. 7, 2005 - Senator Clinton, in Pander Mode
>     
> Hillary Clinton is co-sponsoring a bill to criminalize the burning of the American flag. Her supporters would characterize this as an attempt to find a middle way between those who believe that flag-burning is constitutionally protected free speech and those who want to ban it, even if it takes a constitutional amendment. Unfortunately, it looks to us more like a simple attempt to have it both ways.
>     
> Senator Clinton says she opposes a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag-burning. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that flag-burning was protected by the First Amendment. But her bill, which is sponsored by Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah, is clearly intended to put the issue back before the current, more conservative, Supreme Court in hopes of getting a turnaround.
>     
> It's hard to see this as anything but pandering -- there certainly isn't any urgent need to resolve the issue. Flag-burning hasn't been in fashion since college students used slide rules in math class and went to pay phones at the student union to call their friends. Even then, it was a rarity that certainly never put the nation's security in peril.
>     
> The bill attempts to equate flag-burning with cross-burning, which the Supreme Court, in a sensible and carefully considered 2003 decision, said could be prosecuted under certain circumstances as a violation of civil rights law. It's a ridiculous comparison. Burning a cross is a unique act because of its inextricable connection to the Ku Klux Klan and to anti-black violence and intimidation. A black American who wakes up to see a cross burning on the front lawn has every right to feel personally, and physically, threatened. Flag-burning has no such history. It has, in fact, no history of being directed against any target but the government.
>     
> Mrs. Clinton says her current position grew out of conversations with veterans groups in New York, and there's no question that many veterans -- and, indeed, most Americans -- feel deeply offended by the sight of protesters burning the flag. (These days, that sight mainly comes from videos of the Vietnam War era; the senator's staff did not have any immediate examples of actual New York flag-burnings in the recent past.) But the whole point of the First Amendment is to protect expressions of political opinion that a majority of Americans find disturbing or unacceptable. As a lawyer, the senator presumably already knows that.

I love the American flag, and I love all that it stands for, and I hate the people who stomp on the flag or burn it. But I really think this is not going to pass, this action is supported by our 1st amendment. 
Offensive speech (to include actions), are still protected speech. 

We can loathe and detest those that do it, but we must still defend their roghts to do so. We can't outlaw something just because we disagree with it. 

Which i think might be the main point that DJT is trying to get across amidst this fake news panic bullshit we're going through at the moment. 
WE DID IT
Jail and/or fine =/= loss of citizenship. 
I would consider myself a very strong libertarian and this is such a non issue it makes me sick. I'm so sick of libertarians standing on principal instead of actually helping find solutions to our country's problems.

How the fuck burning our flag in hatred is a violation of free speech is beyond me.
Literally "what's good for the goose is good for the gander...", except for the prison time she's gonna get.
Doesn't matter what Hillary did. I still don't support the ban. And it would take a amendment to over turn Texas v Johnson not just a law.
If that law got passed it would be beautiful.
[The Flag Protection Act of 2005 was a proposed United States federal law introduced by Senators Bob Bennett (R-UT) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY). The law would have prohibited burning or otherwise destroying and damaging the US flag with the primary purpose of intimidation or inciting immediate violence. It called for a punishment of one year in jail and a fine of $100,000. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the act was summarized as such: Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit:  destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; or  stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag either belonging to the United States or on lands reserved for the United States and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005)
OK but the question is whether it should be banned or does it violate the 1st ammendment 
Question I was always taught that if one wished to retire a flag they were to proform a ceremony that involved burning the flag ? Is this wrong ? I learned it in boy scouts 
If the Hampshire college hates the USA so much, I think we should remove all of the security our country provides them. Remove any college security and keep first responders and police away if they are ever attacked. 
I'm pretty sure that would be struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional.

I love the flag.  I proudly stand up and put my hand over my heart whenever I see it being raised, recite the pledge, or hear the national anthem.

However, the freedom of speech we love and hold dear also allows others to do or express things we may find offensive, and that involves desecrating the flag.

In addition, the Supreme Court Decision of Texas v Johnson stated that a flag being burned is symbolic speech and is protected -- even if people find it offensive.

Personally, if someone wants to show their disappointment in our country that much, they shouldn't be in it (Bye Kaepernick), but the decision isn't mine -- it was framed in our Constitution.
hhahahahahah!!!! SUCK IT BITCH 
I definitely support trump, but the American flag, represents the right to burn said flag. They should be ostracized and hated, but they shouldn't be prosecuted by the law.

Honestly I think if something like this passed it would further enforce people's feelings of rebellion that they get from burning the flag, It might increase the amount of flags burned. Not sure though.

I feel like I just stocked up on ammo. 
I mean, can't we just agree that it's a horrible idea no matter who says it? Only reason it didn't get plastered all over reddit when she said it is because she said it 11 years ago. If she'd said it today (or during the election), likely the same response would happen.
I think the better solution is if you burn the flag, The Donald gets to take your wife out to a nice steak dinner then not call her back
!scorebot
The Supreme Court already ruled on this and its constitutionally protected after the case Texas vs Johnson. This kind of nationalism is scary, playing on fear in order to restrict rights we already have been granted. 
Is it free speech? Yes. Is it stupid, poorly articulated that serves no real purpose and doesn't get the message across? Also yes. Unfortunately, a standard of stupidity doesn't apply to free speech, and we just have to accept it.
This is much different from revoking someone's citizenship for a crime.
Does Hillary having this shitty idea before Trump had it make it any less shitty?

I think the difference is that they KNOW trump will follow up.  Before, they were not worried about politicians actually following through with things.  "What do you mean he's actually GOING to do it?!  Racist!!!"  -Some LibCuck

Hillary supporting it doesn't make it right that Trump does. And while Hillary and Trump are both wrong for suggesting a punishment for expressing first amendment rights, Trump is taking it even further by advocating revoking someone's citizenship for it. 
Trump is just a bipartisan deal making machine!
>The flag is a symbol of our right to burn it. 

Impressive mental gymnastics from r/redacted 
First amendment protects our rights to burn the American flag or any flag for that matter. If you guys really support this idea, please tell me why.
Can't they both be wrong? 
This is really confusing to me. Burning the flag is the proper way to dispose of an old flag
Just saying, people who don't ever intend on burning American flags shouldn't have a problem with this proposition.

Let it be known that liberals are the party that stands for burning a flag that veterans lose their lives over for the purpose of it staying up in our country. Yeah, no, let that hard work and bravery be all in vain. But setting off bombs and killing innocent civilians for not siding with a religious belief? *Those* are the people we need to have tolerance for.

Lol and it did.
She could eat a live baby on TV and the left would still be on Trump's case.
Is it ok for me to burn an Aids Skrillex flag though? 
Yes this would be a darn shame.
This is the usual libtard bullshit - Donald Trump voices a questionable personal opinion, they go fucking bananas; Hillary Clinton tries to force through an actual unconstitutional policy, they're completely silent.

If Trump tried to actually make his personal opinion policy, we'd have a problem, but as it is, I share his disgust, and that's all he's voiced.

If I say _"All pedophiles should be shot"_ it doesn't mean I support the death penalty.
All these blatant facts and accurate character portrayals in TD are so toxic.
/r/[redacted] is just overall having a meltdown about Trump winning. The first few pahes are all anti trump bullshit. Gotta love the official politics channel of reddit.
Hell yes! If you burn our nations flag you should face jail-time and a fine. Up until a few years ago, that was a real law until these damn liberals decided to revoke it. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers have died defending you people and that flag. Burning it should be considered treason! 
Except that the bill was as follows: Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace. It states that this bill would only apply if they were burning the flag to incite violence or terrorism, that seems rather reasonable as most things should be punishable if you are using them to incite violence.
Forcefully taking citizenship away vs jail time/fine. Not the same things. Sad!
to be fair there could be people who dont think this should be a law and also dont like hillary clinton
I wouldn't really have a problem with it... seeing as how there are millions of other ways one can protest without disgracing the flag.

That being said... considering /r/all is 90% millennial snowflakes... I quit worrying about what Reddit freaks out about long ago.
Do y'all feel like Hillary is still a threat or something?
I still don't agree. Sorry. I love America and voted for Trump. But it's obviously free speech. 
Flag burners are assholes but they are protected under the 1st amendment. Just as they are free to burn the flag, we are free to defend that right while at the same time denouncing the act.
I don't have an issue with Trump wanting this. I'm over these disrespectful jackwipes. Especially the ones who come here illegally then start waving their flag here demanding right and burning our flag in our faces. Imagine if we did that in any other country.

Over it.
Mfw clinton is somehow representative of the left and perfect. If she truly supports that she is wrong is Donald Trump is and as wrong as the rest of you who support it. Removal of citizenship, really?
It's a clear violation of the first amendment no matter who supports it, like the idiot president elect 

Also I like this quote from Mitch McConnell on flag burning- "People like that pose little harm to our country. But tinkering with our First Amendment might."
Not only that, but a while back a pastor was arrested for wanting to burn the koran. Liberals LOVED that arrest. 
How about both sides are wrong? Or is that not how America works? 
I normally don't agree with trump but I agree with this for sure. The flag shouldn't stand for what the president or authority stands for. It should stand for YOUR America. What you think is the ideal America. After all, this is YOUR country. You need to respect the flag. Protest other ways, flag burning is not ok. 
Although no one seems to care, let's be clear that the bill introduced by Clinton and Bennett **DOES NOT OUTLAW** the burning of a person's own American flag for the purpose of political statement (1st Amendment protected speech). 

*Maybe* President Elect Trump also believes that flag burning should be restricted to the greatest extent possible (like, apparently, Hillary did). But perhaps he thinks it should be banned entirely. That's the trouble with a 140 character tweet. There is zero room for nuance. 
I could see it falling under disorderly conduct. In Texas that makes it a class C misdemeanor which is basically a ticket. Any punishment greater than that seems way too severe to me. 

We're going to take away a year of someone's life because they're stupid and burned the flag? While burglars are getting less jail time. This proposed punishment seems out of proportion and politically motivated to be "tough".
Trump should ban burning the flag as a crime against the environment because the smoke from the burning flag causes global warming. The cuck's heads would explode trying to figure out if they can support Tump's environmental flag burning ban.
That's pretty light as far as I'm concerned. You should go on trial for treason in my opinion.
If someone burned a mexican flag they would go mad
Who the hell would be okay with someone burning our nation's flag? That's not freedom of speech, that's literally degrading the freedom that our Founding Fathers and soldiers all fought and died for.
For gods sake, why can't I hate both?
My issue with flag burning is a shill could do it so the police can use force, on a otherwise peaceful protest. 
!hillaryBad == tumpGood 
MOOOOORRRRREEEEEE TWEEEEEEETTTTSS PPPLLLLEEEEAAASSSSEEE!!!
To be fair; they're both wrong.

Cloth, no matter how it's painted or stitched together should be able to be burned without fines or jail time.
Not shocked. They should both know that the flag is your symbol for being able to burn it.  Also I generally dislike this sub but the spez being in place of edit is funny as hell. Shouldn't edit comments even if you think they are being written by fucks.
They're basically the same person.
Hilary was wrong for proposing the bill and Trump is completely wrong for tweeting it. Texas v Johnson has tackled this issue. 
As it should be!
So can anyone tell me the specifics of Trump's proposal? I'm a bit curious since while burning the flag in anger is certainly bad, at the same time the way you're supposed to retire an old and worn flag is a proper burning procedure, almost like a cremation.
Guys, we were too quick on this one. We should have stayed silent until hillary and her team took the bait.
I don't think it should be illegal, it's one of the bedrocks of our democracy.  It's a way to voice your displeasure, yeah it might piss you off, but it's their right. 
It's a bullshit idea from a legal standpoint.

It's fucking genius to insure the optics of libtards taking the bait and burning flags on camera to make them look like terrorists from the Middle East - and to pivot US sympathies away from them for YEARS.

It's fantastically brilliant.
And yet, those who oppose this ban and support Hillary are not necessarily the same people...
Also I am pretty sure Trump just said this to fuck with the media that portrayed hillary as a progressive democrat,she is really not all that.She is a total hypocrite that will do anything to gain power
Fox still hasn't figured this one out.  They keep bringing on "experts" to talk about how scary a President proposing a new law is.
Not sure the logic... someone we don't like suggests something we must oppose... therefore we should support it?
Hello, **Ms. Pot**, please meet *Mr. Kettle**.
The wiki page if you keep refreshing keeps being altered. I've refreshed several times and the changes to include her back in are hilarious. 
So essentially: if Hillary says it it's ok?
Since when is agreeing with clinton a good thing? 
If you would ask me, I'd say that this was already illegal...
But don't you guys get mad when people say "But Trump did blank!!!" when you discuss Hilarys misdeeds? Seems like the same thing with this topic.. 
So if you turned a blind eye to this issue wouldn't you be just as much of a hypocrite as liberals?
I'm down. You'd think that woman was presidential material. Whatever happened to her?
For what it's worth I'll weigh in and say I would oppose a ban on flag burning in the US. If you want to come burn MY flag that's vandalism but yours? I won't like you but I don't believe it should be illegal. 

I saw someone put it well the other day. Everyone who supports limits on free speech always says "I support free speech, but". Nobody ever says "I only support the right of people to speak that agree with me" but what people don't understand is that free speech means we don't get to make exceptions for people we disagree with.

How is banning flag burning any different than banning the burning of the quran, bible, some other flag, or other similar forms of protest? If Trump supports a ban on flag burning I disagree with him on the issue.
She did vote against a constitutional amendment that would have banned flag burning though. http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/109/senate/2/votes/189/
Still tho, can't say I agree with the idea, coming from either party.
SheBeast: "Now YOU burn!"
Why bother as soon as we get behind him on this. Is he just going to change his mind. I'm a strong trump supporter but he seems to be back tracking on a few very important issues that lead me to vote for him in the beginning.
The only good thing she supports.
Third party voter here. This shit is exactly why Clinton lost.
You are not allowed to burn money and everyone seems okay with it.  I think outlawing flag burning is something that is a tiny step toward unifying this potentially great nation.  It's symbolic.  If you need to shit on America, you can still do anything else.  Shit on a mini statue of liberty, ass rape a realdoll made to look like the president.  Whatever.  One little rule about not burning the symbol of the country you live in doesn't seem that out of line, considering all the other jillions of oppressive and financially irresponsible laws we put up with every single day.  Why do people get so bent out of shape over stupid things like this that has such potential to do great strides in symbolically unifying us.   
One day, we'll have medicine to treat RLD, "Regressive Leftism Disorder."

Symptoms include but are not limited to: Hypocritical lifestyle, denial of reality, facts, logic, sanity. Hatred of self and others who think differently. Poor self image and low self-esteem. Inability to handle conflict and things he/she finds offensive. Preference to punishing success and rewarding failure.

Thank you SheBeast for your service. 

Thank you for the Clinton Foundation and your espionage operation. Thank you for burning down the Democrat party with your openly crooked ways. Thank you for helping to identify illegal aliens casting votes in our country.  Thank you for turning States evidence next year.

Thank you Hilldog, for burning down Americas enemies.
People should be allowed to burn any flag they please in the United States, including the US flag.
After Immigrating from Israel, I was just shocked to find out that they let you do that here with no punishment :S
I don't support this. Isn't the correct way to dispose of a flag is by burning it? This is tiddlywinks legislation IMO stick to Obamacare and the shit that actually impacts peoples lives.
This was #3 on hot when it should have been number one. Then all of a sudden POOF it disappeared from hot my hot page all together??????? Quicker than Hillarys emails.
And this just mysteriously disappeared from the top post on /r/all... Reddit is fucking pathetic. 
The view was having a freak out over it as well. They're also going to have Jill Stein on sometime this week. 
Expecting to be able to burn the flag without consequence is kind of like me going to stay at my friend's house while I eat his food.. fuck his wife... and tell him what a piece of shit he is... and expect to stay there as long as I want without anyone giving me a hard time about it.

Where I come from we have a name for that:  fucking lunacy
kek
Pshhh, they never read the bills that they vote on. That makes the fact that Hillary supported this more believable. 
Looks like I need to go into the flag business
i don't care who said it first. i support this message lol
I don't even think Donald has proposed banning flag burning. He just said he is against it.
One of the small steps that need to be taken to actually start winning again. 
Still hate Hillary, but this makes me hate her slightly less.
CLICK UP faster 7k only!
The same people who are all for the 1st amendment today believe people should be forced to bake gay wedding cakes, want to ban hate speech, and believe flying the confederate flag should be outlawed. 

Bottom line: Liberals believe in free speech as long as it angers their enemies. 
One of her ***many*** failed bills.
It appears admins removed this from /all... went from very top to not even in the top 500.

edit: half an hour later they put it back at 90. WTF are they doing? They wait until people notice before they undo their censorship? 
The same Liberals screeching about staying true to the constitution today are, at the same time, pushing for the electoral college to do something nowhere in the constitution!!! (I am so sick of the lack of principles on the left) 
Top keks.
DELICIOSO
ch
I don't think reddit cares about Hillary anymore.
Trump has the media in the palm of his hand lol. 
Here is the view we have in the UK for anyone who wants to widen their perspective 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-IrzJqfTQA&ab_channel=mattdavies12
I'm confused. Why can't I think that Hillary's bill is/was bad and that Donald Trump's statements are dangerous? No? I have to be caught in some sort of false choice...?
Right on.  You wanna burn our flag?  Get the fuck outta here.  We don't want you!
What doesn't reddit have a meltdown over?  
Love this.
Damn, I'm a Hilldog now
It's just unfortunate that you disagree with flag burning on principle, I'd hope they can show these ridiculous labels like that and the refugee crisis is partially about pushing their chosen candidate, the one that I've never had much critical acclaim whilst not meeting your cuckboy standards of actual racism.

I find the practice of burning flags extremely disgusting, and I'm from Iran! 
God tier trolling
Citizenship
Trump is playing 9D chess.
One does not excuse the other, and both are horrendous.
so many people don't remember this
OH PLEASE LET THIS GO VIRAL
THEY'RE MAKING THIS TOO EASY!!! I'll never get tired of winning so much. 
I just jacked off to this but I covered Hillary's soul stealing face and man baby body
Everyone got trolled. Nobody burn anything. Let's move on already. 
Finland has some silly honor rules for treating the flag. There's no prison sentence IIRC, but you can't have the flag on your underwear and if you need to dispose of it you have to burn it instead of throwing it into the trash.
[removed]
The real difference here is that Clinton is not the president elect and therefore stands no chance at enacting anything like this amendment.  Yes, she co-sponsored similar legislation 11 years ago  and it died before ever being considered or argued over.  Therefore, this argument holds no real world meaning.  That legislation died and she was not elected, therefore, what really is your argument here?  Say something about the actual tweets that the actual person in power is creating over an actual possible course of legislation.

You are neglecting the idea that those speaking out against Donald Trumps ideas would not have also spoken out against Hilary's as well.  Since Hilary's gained no traction in Congress, it died a lonely, unknown existence.  Had it gained traction and become a part of the political discourse, it most certainty would have been resisted by many of the same people speaking out now.

These 'gotcha' moments do nothing but shift the focus away from the actual issues that need to be brought into the light of day and discussed in open and transparent ways.  This is nothing more than an attempt to muddy the waters and cause division among the population instead of open and honest discussion about the great country we all contribute to.

I get the impulse though, your guy won and it feels great.  Lets try to move past that and take a hard look at the ideas he is proposing and talk about the things that will affect all Americans.
I remember seeing The_Donald being flooded with Hillary supporters that were mocking us as the votes were about to start coming in. Before they knew what was happening, I was watching a sweet video of all those Liberals crying. It was a glorious victory.

Can I see the morning after posts?
I'm curious.  Why are all the social media sites run by liberals and why aren't there any run by conservatives that aren't just bible-thumping blogs?
Oh god, not only did they have to eat their own words, but they ended up extra salty 
I will always cherish the teary eyed PBS anchors that night, and I've saved a lovely screenshot of the CNN crew looking defeated. My based 13 year old son was openly laughing at the television set that night. 
I remember being dull and sad that night

Then some interesting numbers coming - well he has a chance after all... and went to sleep

Then woke up and BOOM the_donald in flames and then I spent a good deal of the day watching youtube SJW meltdown videos
This summarizes the left right here. At no point did we talk about invading r/arfarfarf and giving them shit if (when) they lost. 

I had people I know irl talk about spamming a Trump supporter we knew from highschools Facebook page. They were literally plotting on how to all go in and make fun of him at once when Trump lost (he didn't). Well guess who looks pretty fucking stupid now. 
I wish I had saved it, but some shill sent me a PM a couple of days before the election with a suicide hotline number telling me the following few days would be ROUGH for me. =) 
Oh how I wish those usernames were visible. If I could just see their falling out.... hnnng
How was your afternoon? **MILDLY AMUSING??**

I still love re-watching this one - Why Donald Trump [Won The U.S. Presidential Election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lOhZZWgbd4).
Then there's [this gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqEddipbpkw&feature=youtu.be) as well :) 
you know what? yeah i went to r/politics that night to watch the meltdown, but was not even slightly a douche. i fought the good fight i always have fought.


if *they* would have won though?

You can tell how dated this picture is because its missing the newest talking point: "He was scared of hateful rhetoric"
He didn't have a safe place to pray
He was just trying to get to class on time and took a bit of a shortcut by running down some kuffars. And then he was just practicing his interpretive knife dancing when that evil racist white cop gunned him down! What's the big deal guyz
well this one has aged nicely
#SANCTUARY CITIES FOR JIHADIS!
It's fucked up when you don't even need a new cartoon
Allahu Akbar! My radical Imam came into my room to bring me a plate of Hummus and I literally screamed at him and hit the hummus out of his hand. He started yelling at me, gave me 50 lashes for disrespecting him, and threatened to throw me off a building if I kept acting so homosexual. He glared at me as I sat shivering in the corner and then he left, closing the door behind him. I'm so distressed and starving from Ramadan right now that I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my Imam but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. I want the whole world to be Muslim. I want to be a good, faithful servant to Islam and get my 72 virgins in heaven.
I get your point, but remember the victims here were mostly science and engineering students and faculty who work hard studying and doing research to make America great again.
All aboard the social media shit storm! 
No one is ever held accountable for their own actions anymore. 

I don't understand how tolerance extended all the way to defending criminals. The road to hell is paved with good intentions and hell is where we are headed.
I love how they have the phantom balls to call terrorists mentally ill even though they were shouting "Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar!" while gunning down and running over crowds.
He literally said it was the media that made his fear reach levels of violence.

Literally blamed the media. For inciting violence.

Yeah, he was a victim, just like every other person living in this country. Subjected to the biased, and corrupted news, that incites violence and hatred among Americans so they have something to cover in their 24/7 news cycle.

The media is intentionally divisive and incites violence and hate for profit. It's not only appalling, it's illegal, it's treasonous.
###WELP
It would be funny if it were not so true.
Yo. This just killed the Doritos stock. Take that cool ranchers!

TFW a gay jew who obsessed about dating black men is a racist white nationalist...
Uh, I'm pretty sure Milo has said many times how he loves Black guys. I mean, he really loves them. A LOT.
By their own rules, CNN should now be called out as anti gay.
The white nationalist who wanted to lead a gay pride parade through sweden?  
Oh Milo the white nationalist black man loving gay jew. That makes perfect sense. 
Funny, they take every chance they get to pull out their token gay/jew cards when describing someone

#unless it's someone that disagrees with them
I really don't understand this Nationalist criticism. Like just look up "Nationlist" in the thesauraus, It lists GOOD CITIZEN as a synonym! The antonym or opposite of Nationlist is TRAITOR.
#CNN == FAKENEWS
Conservative Gay Jew=**FUCKING WHITE MALE**
Wow, that really is fake news. What a slimy fucking joke of a "news" organization
He IS Jewish by halachic standards (we don't care if you literally practice a different religion, sorry folks it's God that decides not man)
Demand correction!
"I'm not a white nationalist."

-Milo BBC 2016
Seems legit
 Did CNN even mention Milo is gay?

 CNN, still flailing. Their sickness runs really deep.

Looks like they've now edited the title, unless this was a shop.

http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/kfile-michael-flynn-milo/index.html
So disgusting. CNN is literally fake news
Wait, I thought Milo was Christian 
Yes, noted white supremacist Milo Yiannopolis, who announced his desire to, 'fuck every black man out there'. How could Trump be even remotely associated with someone so hateful?!
He is Roman Catholic?   Right?  Unless OP knows something we don't.  Which could be true.
He's not even american
Milo's bus came through the town I work in, "Dangerous Faggot Tour" in huge letters on the side of it... it was awesome. Still wondering why it was in Wellsboro, PA?? Middle of nowhere.
 
How many black dicks does Milo have to suck for them to stop calling him a white nationalist? Because he's sucked a lot of black dicks already.
Okay, but too bad Milo's a scammer. 
I'm a white nationalist. Not racist or supremacist, just nationalist. 
This is the part in the movie where one of the bad guys tries to use their flawed logic on a dangerous faggot and their mind can't take all the facts at once and it explodes in a harmless puff of smoke.

Milo is just a normal reporter, but he has done some great work. 
I'm sick of all these Jewish, Greek, European born faggots hating us white folk!  I've been oppressed enough by Milo suggesting I dress in a suit and carry a LV bag!
you know the more they use these words like white nationalist and white supremacist, the more they just mean nothing
I f*cking love Milo (no homo, cause I'm a married woman). Milo, on the off chance you're reading this, PM me, friend me and let's hang out when you're in the NYC area. I'll buy you a coffee. (One can dream, I know.) 
CNN will next call Sheriff Clarke a white nationalist.
Does no one realize they're calling trump the white nationalist? Cause that's what this is, news headline just makes it look ambiguous 
[Fake News](http://i.imgur.com/yAwjoFF.jpg)
Milo sex tape released. ultimate BTFO. Would CNN cover Milo the White Nationalist sex tape?


Can they be more original and use something other then the race card?

Wait what? The CNN article is ridiculous, but Milo's a catholic not a jew.
Milo is catholic...

Female judge with short hair.... Not good.

Edit: NEW STREAM http://fox6now.com/on-air/live-streaming-sc/

---

Edit 1: 5:38pm Jill's team is arguing FOR Clinton and that the electronic total could have caused her to lose. It's a set up.

---

Edit 2: 5:39pm Judge is overruling things in favor of Jill's team. Clearly this witness should not be giving expert evidence on someone else' study.

---

Edit 3: 5:41pm Witness is saying that smaller ward statistical amounts are off. This is because smaller wards go to Trump big league. They don't have liberals in rural farm towns...

---

Edit 4: 5:44pm Witness admits that none of his statistical analysis can prove anything was off.

---

Edit 5: 5:45 Witness is implying that the vote totals in the machines are off and hand count will be lower. This is 100% in line with my theory that they will be destroying absentee ballots and then claiming the vote totals are off.

---

Edit 6: 5:51pm This "Expert" is clearly pushing for a hand recount so they can destroy ballots. This is their plan. After seeing the narrative in court pushed by Jill's(soros) team it has to be the plan. They destroy some ballots and then say the totals are off.

---

Edit 7: 5:55 Jill's lawyer makes herself seem so stupid. Saying that even though 4 times they have verified the recount and it was correct the count could still be off.

---

Edit 8: 5:56 CROSS EXAMINE TIME!

---

Edit 9: 5:57 States lawyer asks why he is referencing other peoples work when he has no knowledge of how accurate their work is and is not familiar with the study or involved in it.

---

Edit 10: 5:58 Stream went out during cross examine!!!!

---

Edit  11: 5:59 It's back. WTF the state barely asked any questions... this is bullshit. They is highly suspect. They could have crossed examined him for 10+ more minutes and a dozen questions.

---

Edit 12: 6:01 Witness admits that he can not be sure the totals were off enough to equal 22k and that the anomalies affected BOTH Trump and Clinton. The judge called out that this affects both people.

---

Edit 13: 6:03 HEADSHOT Witness is now saying that the anomalies affect BOTH and that he cannot be sure it affected Clinton and not Trump.

---

Edit 14: 6:04 Break until 6:20. Getting coffee! Will be back a bit later than them. Someone keep me posted and reply with what happens!
This needs to be stickied
SHUT THIS SHIT DOWN, JUDGE!
Expert testimony that hand counting would be more accurate due to lack of cyber security threats
This is a complete farce.  I hope Stein and all others involved are held to full account after this bullshit is over.
'uh uh uh uh'.....this guy went to the same public speaking school as barry
Sighting the washington post as sources LOL who are these people. 
Holy shit....they handpicked this judge.  She let the lawyers do whatever they wanted.  She let them speak for 4 hours without a shred of evidence.  And she STILL RULED AGAINST THEM.  Jill's team is truly incompetent.
So it's a handpicked liberal judge, is there even a point in watching this?  They can testify space aliens came down and shot vote lasers at the machines and she'd still approve it.  I hope the board of elections quadruples the price estimate again.
So they want to use the excuse of hacking to recount as many states they want until they get the election overturned? This is bullshit.
Dude is full of it

I've worked on industrial scanners and when they pick up two pieces of paper stuck together they tend to jam
OK everybody every time you hear "AHH, Uhm" take a drink
If I was the judge, I'd shut this shit down right now and tell these fools to get the fuck out of my courtroom.
FYI this is one of the most liberal judges in the state 
why the fuck is someone testifying regarding research that they didn't do?
I stopped listening after the judge asked the MILLION dollar questions. would the irregulairties favor one candidate over an another?..............LONG pause.. uhhhh.. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Halderman actually blamed podesta leaks
uh..uh...uh...uh...uhh.....
if we had a dollar for every time this guy has said uh we'd all be as rich as Trump! 
Oh yeah we got an expert on statistics to testify

FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
None of this makes sense.  The professor states the chance of seeing anomalies out of the batches tested by the state are very low and doesn't swing toward either candidate.  The whole US should have the same small anomalies considering the human factor.  This should not mean we should recount the whole election.  This is so fucked.

this is a retarded clusterfuck. 
"Amazing display of excellent lawyering."  Already showing she's unqualified to be a judge.
SHE IS FOLLOWING THE LAW .... THERE ISN'T CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE. CASE CLOSED ... WIN FOR WI
#WHAT FUCKING CHANNEELLLLLL
What a fraud! Sad!
Hillary voters are too stupid to fill the ballots out correctly.  - Expert
There is mighty powerful fuckery at work for these morons to even be able to step foot in a courtroom with no evidence but somebody quoting someone else's research and WaPo. 
Judge ruling against Stein.

I really don't care one way or another, but fun to watch her lose.
This post is getting buried...
Well what do you know the judge actually followed the law.  I was wrong!
anomalies (final digit distribution based on large numbers) found in small wards (100 ballots).

Fuck sake, I'm a dumb redneck and I can see through that argument. 
#UP UP UP
Why is the Judge asking questions?!?!?!
She is leading the witness ..... How are they not objecting all these questions?
Stein's team is arguing the possibility of hacking and the merits of hand count.  NO ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF HACKING and yet, the Judge is eating it up!  Sad
Weird how nobody cared when we were calling 20 different states for the past year saying the voting machines couldn't be trusted.  "Everything perfectly secure, they can't be hacked, trust us," they said.  Every last one of them.       
         
Now that the criminal lost, suddenly we were right all along.
Lawyer is actively shilling for HRC at this point.  
This is farcical. No evidence of anything, no reason to believe there's a problem, but hey why not. It's not like common sense matters when Clintons are involved.

They're so focused on the integrity of the machines, hopefully they'll be just as concerned about the integrity of the recount. (lol)
Says testifying professor's evidence is Hearsay!
Says no clear and convincing evidence, and it is up to the boards to decide how they want to recount the votes.


This guys loves it when unclean, diseased, filthy people have sex with his spouse. 
Liberal judge 
Sneaky russians able to hack without internet connection
I hope most trails are more professional than this.  This is a trainwreck.
So they've effectively admitted their goal is to overturn the election.
What the fuck. arguing that there were statistical outliers is not proof. There are always outliers you fucking cunts
Um.
So the first geek mentioned that large votes were where hacking could occur. The numbers guy says the problem is with small districts <100 votes. So which is it?
COUNTIES CAN DO RECOUNT HOW THEY CHOOSE!
RemindMe! 45 minutes
Did I hear this cuck right? Did he just say if the last number is less than 5, there is a greater chance of error than if its more than 5?

This bodes very well for Michigan and Penn.
Point out that there was not any mis read of the ballots, people didn't vote for republican, state congress, governors, senate, and congress and then vote for Hillary.
Backward counting buffer overflows?  
This whole thing is Stupid and this dumb BLM leader who claims the hero that stopped the Ohio man is not a hero and something something FOX news is racist might even be dumber. 
Every single one of her questions should have been objected, this is a fucking absurdity!!!

This is the biggest lie i've ever heard.
I didn't want to take this seriously...this is really really bad though...
#HOLY SHIT....I feel like I'm taking crazy pills
Sounds like she has shot it down.  Winning!
I can hear the defendants whisper...
Is the stream down or are they just late getting back?  "10 minute" break lol
Jill's lawyer sounds like she is going to cry while she is asking questions
[the non-existent] Russian hacking, just restated as the primary concern.
This is pure Bullshit.
Where is Trump or his people on this? This is upsetting.
I get the states play now - if you present one opposing view, then the evidence isn't 100% clear and convincing.
The state should of made the case that there is a possibility of human error also. Just like when people regretted voting for Hillary Clinton
SOUNDS LIKE SHE MIGHT NOT ALLOW IT
can someone explain WTF just happened
Wow
Clinton has a lawyer talking. https://twitter.com/msommerhauser/status/803772813345689600
Stein attorney: This is 1st time in pres election there are confirmed, sustained attacks from foreign IP addresses aimed @ election outcome
This state lawyer is terrible..
Wow...was not expecting her to follow the law
The biggest thing is a judge just said they have no evidence.  That will go a long way in PA, and probably Michigan.  
Wisconsin is calling one person so yeah this will be given to Stein. 
Stein's side is done. https://twitter.com/abeckettwrn/status/803761175880232961
Did the video just loop?
Is the stream working for anyone?
Broadcast no longer available. Anyone got a copy?

This lady says correct too much
My god - this is a cut-rate lawyer team.
oh here we go... lies about the "hacked" emails !
any better live links that dont have broken audio
I can't watch in at work what the duck is going on?
JUDGE HAS RETURNED
NO HAND RECOUNT !
So hold on, doesn't this just mean the counties can go ahead with the hand recounts?
She is stating there is just allegations and no true evidence of hacking. Heresay Evidence
God dammit.
Did the stream die?
Now this new stream is down WTF
ok feed back up 
http://fox6now.com/on-air/live-streaming-sc/
So lets say they have the hand recount and there are between many wrong and enough to switch the results. I would then think this would be a REAL good reason to outlaw EVM or have sweeping changes nationwide. We all worried about Soros and his machines. This may be the chance to use this sham to correct the corruption.

I myself think that DJT won, and will be vindicated by a recount so I'm not worried too much.
Lolololol their witness is late!  The hearing started two hours ago!
OUT OUT OUT
Haas kind of sucks at answering questions.
Anyone have new stream link?
She paid and now they're doing the recount. Even if she didn't win an all state hand recount, some counties are choosing to recount by hand :/ 
Aww manüòídid we [break](https://imgur.com/a/yxopq) it?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DztjvcdNV3A mirror


Pretty sure it's illegal cuz she's not allowed to fundraise it and didn't pay first.

https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/9/01
man they are sure gonna feel salty when that hand recount shows trump still won
Honestly, it is probably best if they do a full hand recount anyway.

If they do a partial, they will cherry pick the areas that most favor Hillary in an attempt to get more votes for her via the "intent of the voter" standard.

Main thing is Trump or the RNC will need to have people on the ground to make sure he isn't getting hosed.
She's allowing recounts
CNN only gives this choice 4 Hitlers out of 5.
Elaine Chao for Transportation Secretary

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Chao

She also served under GW Bush and GHW Bush, and is the wife of Mitch McConnell.
The God Emperor now controls Mitch McConnell's sex life.
Keep an eye on this one, try not to hold it against her, she's married to Mitch McConnell. Hope this isn't the start of a moat swamp. 
He grabbed Mitch McConnell's pussy REEEEEEEEEE
How DARE this WHITE MALE dress up like an ASIAN WOMAN! This is SO WRONG IM LITERALLY SHAKING AND STUFF RIGHT NOW
Least racist/sexist/ageist move possible, appointing elderly female asian to handle the driving stuff! Well played!
He is such a racist woman hater....RRREEEEEEEE
Genius move, he's got the neocon Turtle Man in his back pocket now  to get his agenda through the Senate.
This is a 4D Chess move.  you get someone in office that has the experience to actually do the job, then when the need arises, a point of manipulation for the Senate majority leader.  

It shows Trump seems to be thinking very tactically. 
This woman has terrible judgement.  She's married to Mitch McConnell
Can we get a concise list of everyone that he's appointed so far? It seems like each day, we get word of another person being appointed, and I'd like to see what percentage is actually white/male.
I want to be sensitive.

I want to be perceived as non-judgemental.

I want peace and harmony for all people.

However.

If she has not adjusted her hairstyle by January 21, then there will be blood.
How long until CNN takes credit for his female and minority appointments, claiming he wouldn't have done it if not for the pressure from the "real media"
she got a position for transportation :D self driving cars faster trains here we come :D
Her hair is straight out of the '70s 
Who is that? 
Another white fucking male - smh.
FUCKING WHITE MALE
Ah, Mitch McConnell's wife. I'm not sure how I feel about this. 
So I'm checking Google for a funny pic of Aids Skrillex to post, and lo and behold, [this gem](http://www.infostormer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/decom_cuck3_56f3cfad97131.jpg) appears. 
Lucy Liu?......Lol, just kidding, Lucy Liu?
What a FUCKING WHITE MALE!
Did you see the size of that flag pin? Patriot!
As a Bush staffer and McConnell's wife I really don't trust her, however I trust Trump's judgment.  

I suppose Chao does give him an "in" with McConnell to get initiatives through the Senate.
That awkward moment when you realize the secretary of transportation now resembles your mom somewhat.
Unfortunately she's married to Bitch McConnell.  He's the epitome of big government, establishment Republicans.  Drain the swamp!
I probably just happened to flip to the channel at the perfect moment but last night Anderson Cooper was saying how impressed he was with how transparent Trump's transition process has been.  
Whew.. that hairstyle is straight out of  90's politics. 

Seriously I think Laura Bush had the same one. 


I don't see how this is draining the swamp
I think it's that pin that kinda makes him look like an Asian lady.
Another old white guy. Is that R Lee Ermy?

##ANOTHER FUCKING WHITE MALE THANKS DRUMPF
Glad to see Trump is continuing his tradition of only appointing white males to all administration positions.  He is clearly qualified you can tell based on his luscious glowing white skin
WFM; look at him! Thinks he's soooo privileged.
Look at that big ass American Flag pin.  Somebody is reading our posts.  hmmmmmmmmm  Could she be a closet centipede?
A young Asian Betty white?
IM NOT LIKING HOW MITCH THE BITCH IS MARRIED TO HER
This anons Obama-care premiums are so high he/she can't get new glasses :(
Fuck for a minute there I thought it said Ellen Pao.
White fucking males
She looks like she took her dress and optimism straight from the 80's. 
She's trans-sexual **and** trans-racial? That's a two-fer!
Whoddis?
Why is that white male dressing like a woman? Gender appropriation.
What a wacist
Honestly, I don't agree with this. The wife of the turtle Bitch McConnell?
Is that George Takei ??  Fucking White Male !!!
I think chessmaster 5000 purposely put all the white males in right out of the gate to freak out the libs... 
So much for draining the swamp 
Before you start high fiving this, she's Mitch McConnel's wife. She's been appointed to a job that would greatly benefit from the passing of Trumps massive spending bill, and her husband is a 'never Trump' RINO who has threatened to block that bill.

This is a 'favor' appointment in order to get Republicans to hold their nose and spend millions of tax dollars.

Nobody in this sub should be happy about this.
DEMS ARE THE REAL RACISTS
Because the whole thing was setup by the CIA. 
What makes you think the government doesn't have her at a black site?
They alluded to witness protection for her.  I believe her grade school teacher came out saying she was kind of... special.
She went down the memory hole.
She has been seen NYT did an "interview" remember Folks CNN approval granted [Not Fake News At All... ](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/us/politics/orlando-shooting-omar-mateen-noor-salman.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=2)
Obama let her run off to Jordan. Meanwhile the father had VIP seats at Hillary's rally. 
She is vacationing with Huma everyone knows this
Find her and I'm sure you'll find Eric Braverman. 
She's probably already found a nice liberal cuck to raise her terroists kid
She was probably his CIA handler.
Friends of Bill
We love our first responders, don't we folks?
As someone who works in this line of work, thank you. I've received so much hate for what I do for a living and this sub doesn't make me feel like a vile piece of shit. So thankful for all you centipedes, first responders or no.

Stay safe out there, brothers.
I'll never forget the time when idiots were cutting firefighters' hoses putting out fires THEY started in the Baltimore riots. Those same hoses won't be there for you while burning in hell.
During the election, Gatlinburg was covered with Trump signs. All the shops on the strip sold any piece of Trump memorabilia you could think of. Very based city.
If you are considering donating, remember to try and keep the donations to local churches, volunteers or local relief efforts.

Here is some of the scary footage here recently

There shouldn't be a single kid in the world who doesn't see firefighters as heroes, they fight against power itself, fire.


They are saving lives against the full power of fire, these are men who can tell the very basic foundations of nature to go fuck itself.


Im under the ploom.  
#As a law enforcement official *and* volunteer fireman in my town, I simply cannot upvote this post enough.  MAGA#
I'm a little over an hour away from Gatlinburg, the smoke that we've seen especially in the last week has been worrisome. I hope everyone is safe. I have heard comments from co-workers that people are claiming on FB that this is God punishing TN for voting Trump. I don't understand why people have to make political comments about disasters such as this. Everyone in the area, stay safe.
What are the odds. I am a alumni of OSU along with my wife and her family. We live in Columbus. Our entire family just returned a few weeks ago from our cabin in Gatlinburg. Now we are waiting on feedback about the situation. This all hits close to home. 
Wow I love this place. Tennessee appreciates the shoutout
Whoa, embarassed to say, I have/had no idea this was going on. Anyone able to give me a quick rundown on details?
I love the Gatlinburg area, and it breaks my heart to see it in flames.
#We have the best boots on the ground, folks, believe me. Stay safe!
We have the best first responders folks! I'm 30 minutes from Gatlinburg, and there's a wildfire in my town too. Pray for all Eastern Tennessee folks not just Gatlinburg, it's a shitshow down here. Those in Gatlinburg, stay safe and GTFO while you can. 
They need to get resources from the Pacific NW down there, we got rain and snow so we don't need them 
We had a huge wind storm last night with power outages. So these people are have to deal with broken trees everywhere. 
Live in knoxville,and am praying for all our first responders and people that live in the Gatlinburg area.
Thank you for posting this OP. Whenever I go on shift I've always prayed to come home to my kids but never had to think about my whole city being on fire. That would be terrifying. I hope every FF and EMT is able to remain unharmed.

Thank you to this domreddit as well for supporting all first responders. Just putting on the uniform has everyone a little on edge lately, especially with the Firemen being shot at in Milwaukee by their rioters.
#PRAYERS FOR EVERYONE HERE

Pay attention to your surroundings please! 
So which is it this time? Hillary supporters or muslims?

Ah, who are we kidding? We know they're the same people.
Don't forget that the lake lure and south mountain areas of NC have been on fire for weeks. As well as pinnacle mountain and table rock in SC!!! 
This breaks my heart. My wife and I go there at least once a year. The mountains of my hometown have also been burning due to arsonists and I can only hope that everyone is okay and these fucks are brought to justice.
I'm worried about the aquarium... 

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/11/29/fire-forces-ripleys-aquarium-employees-leave-thousands-animals-behind/94591544/
Used to live and work in that area. So sad to see the destruction. Praying for all those affected and those working 24/7 to get it under control.
Most patriotic subreddit. MAGA
I live in the North Georgia area. It's bad over here guys. 
We have the best first responders don't we folks?

Above is a list of groups,  their locations, times, and what they're accepting. 
I just got back from vacation there on Monday. Such a nice place, great people.
Thankful for your bravery and sacrifices!  Our prayers are with you.
I Lift you up in prayer, all my Brothers and Sisters responding to the fires today...

**LCES* is going to be more important than ever**; I have worked IC on scene with open prairie and ravine with urban interface, but to do lookout or IC on steep slopes with smoke has got to be hard. 

Stay safe and God go with you. 

(LCES * = Lookout Comms Escape Safety)
BASED city! Praying for all you first responders!
Prayers from MO coming your way. Stay strong. 
Stay safe!  Gatlinburg is a beautiful area.  This is so sad.
amen!
Thank you first responders!!
sending you much pede love and strength!
There's no doubt in my mind that this was started by either an angry Hillary supporter or a Soros thug.
Wow, I was just in Gatlinburg a few weeks ago...surreal
This is so sad. We love going to the mountains and Gatlinburg. It's half gone. 
We have the best first responders dont we folks! Get this first responder patriot a coat!
We have the best first responders dont we folks! Get this first responder patriot a coat!
Former volunteer fireman here. Wildfires are the absolute worst. The smoke, hiking with heavy gear, carrying fuel (wood/etc) by hand up and down mountains, it's just miserable. When I served in the 90s, my little department didn't have separate gear for wildfires, so they made us wear our turnout jacket and structure fire helmet. Misery.

We were at Dollywood for our anniversary in October, and I just can't believe the pictures I'm seeing along the main drag in Pigeon Forge. Surreal.

I do not say this lightly: my wife and I, my entire church, are praying for emergency services and the people whose lives are being affected. May God bless you.
Currently deployed overseas atm, there is nothing more i'd like to do than throw my gear in my truck and head north from Ga to help the crews out. God bless those boys.
As a former wildland firefighter I thank you all for giving these guys the respect they deserve. It is very difficult work and most are away from their homes and families for sometimes months at a time.


*Death rides the forest to steal away the souls of the careless*
Stay safe and thank you for all you do
I live an hour away. I didn't know how bad it was until this morning. Smoke all over the place.
That's so cool and thoughtful. I used to live in that area. Last thing I expected to see on this sub.
Any info on how this started? Anon seems to have made up its mind.
I could smell it from my house in MI last night. No joke. 
I have a cabin booked in 3 weeks in pigeon forge. I hope everything and everyone is OK. :(
Yes good luck and God bless.
Stay safe.
I've been to Gatlinburg, and the smokies twice.

Great Weekend Vacation!

Hopefully, no loss of life and major damage damage.


My family and I visited Gatlinburg last year. Such a lovely little town. I can't believe what's happening down there. Stay safe out there!
Salute to the first responders!
What caused the fire?
It makes me sick seeing the pictures and watching the videos. Being from my area means I've spent a lot of time down there. I hope they can get put on ASAP. This is not why they are called the Smoky Mountains. 
My wife and I love the area. We were hoping to visit it this Spring. 

They actually had to close the National Park down for a day or two while we were there the first time because of a fire. Nothing remotely like this, though. So sad.

Thank you to the brave firefighters and other first responders. 
I love our first responders. I HATE the fact that their political higher ups actually like wildlands disasters. They get big FEMA grants the following year to buy more antiquated chrome apparatus and overpriced retardant air drops. I sold fire trucks for 44 years and have seen almost every effective new idea/apparatus loved by the first responders and killed by the big bosses. I was even told by a City of L.A. Fire boss who ran their wildlands dozers "are you trying to ruin my overtime?"

Don't worry too much about Gatlinburg firefighters. I competed in a firefighter competition with some of them. They are certified badasses. 
Mr. Trump please send.

https://youtu.be/wC6bo3XJnVQ
Stuff like this is why I love this community. 
I hope the animals in the aquarium stay alive.  
I let my EMT license expire, and I have moved on to another line of work, but I still have a lot of love for those of you who are still out there making it happen every night and day! 

When I heard about the fires last night I was a bit bummed to not be heading east to lend a hand. Wild fires in the mountains are a real beast, and getting water up there is a challenge. 

Also, just subscribed to The_Donald after lurking for a while. Guess I can sit back and wait for the bans to start rolling in now?? 
Both my father and grandfather were volunteer firefighters in the past. Huge respect for first responders, and if presented the opportunity I'd like to follow in their footsteps.
Does anyone have any legit info on the First responders there? Are there enough to provide relief for the local crews or do they need people?
Nooooooooo . Best haunted house ever..... and very based town 
Keep a foot in the black.... 
Bristol, TV/VA resident here assisting in the Smoky Mountain wildfire.  Ripley Aquarium has been spared by the fire all the animals are safe, over 150 structures have been destroyed, will update later. 
"We love you for the sacrifices you have made and will continue to make!" Felt it was worth repeating. Thank you men and women for the choice you make every day you head to work.  Stay safe and God speed!
I lived I Arizona when the 19 were killed at the Yarnell Fire. We lived outside Phoenix and not one, but two where local. One of which the kid of one went to my daughters school. The kid was the strongest one saying how much her dad loved to do what he did and it was to protect the earth more than any one person or their property. 

Thanks for what you do!
As a former paramedic, CYA, and dont forget that if u get get hurt it just makes more casualties. Stay safe out there 
I just saw this in the news...is the town of gatlinburg seriously burning to the ground?!?!?!
Damn.  Was just there last week.  Stayed at a hotel that is right in the middle of the fires.  Beautiful part of this country.  I've loved Gatlinburg since I was a kid and it breaks my heart to see it burning. Hope everyone is safe.
Holy shit, I live near here and this is a huge thing here. And it's on thedonald, nice!
live an hour away from G-Burg, can confirm it's based as fuck. Trump merch everywhere last time I visited back in September.
Lovin all the love this sub provides. I'm hopeful we can wake more people up as we continue to spread! Stay safe!
Chattanoogan here, thank you for your service
At first I thought this was President Trump's official response and was thinking "since when was he a first responder" but then I realized this has nothing at all to with with Donald Trump.
Thoughts for all of you.  

I have family and friends near there and they are loading up churches and centers with Gatorade and energy bars for the firefighters.

There are a lot of them and they're easy to find on Facebook if you're looking for somewhere to send help to the firefighters and first responders.
Checking in from Tennessee. It's really sad, Gatlinburg is a great place. I've been there at least 20 times and just ugh. I'm glad Dollywood and the aquarium are okay, but the amount of damage is just unbelievable.
Just got back from a two week detail on Friday, had local brush fires all weekend, and rain today. Unless they have serious precip down there, looking like I'll be in TN by the end of the week. 

I love what I do, though. 
##GOD BLESS ALL IN THE AREA AFFECTED! I have not heard a word from anyone in the area other than facebook. All lines are down. No idea if our rental home made it or not.

If Romney gets the boot this picture will turn into one of the greatest memes in the history of The_Donald.
Trump is grabbing him by the balls under the table. "Smile for the camera."

Anyway, proves Trump's not Sexist. 
Look at that shit eating grin... fuck I love Prez Trump.
That's the face of somebody that got offered the equivalent of a job in the mailroom.
#REVENGE TIME
Romney looks like he has diarrhea.
Please god let this picture represent tomorrows news.
Unfortunately I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen. Newt said "Trump should remember who has been there for him, those who liked him as both a candidate and president elect. Not those who are bending to him once he's president." I hope Trump listens to Gingrich before it's too late.  I'm remaining cautiously pessimistic though.
Mittens bending the knee.  
trump is just constantly trolling. i freaking love it.
FUCKING LOL
Im thinking ambassador to Libya
His face is the face of someone who tried to play chess with the Devil and just realized they're in checkmate.
This could be Romney's 'official' effort at mea cupla...a somewhat pained look of self awareness after a fuck up. A grimace for the camera falls a long way short of Alex Jones' demand for a public excoriation (i.e a 'teary' apology). Point is I smell a rat...and AT LEAST a 70pc chance The Donald will pick Romney. Its fucked. But what can you do? 
Trump: "So I'm thinking you would be a great addition to the White House cafeteria staff, this meal is the first dish I would like you to learn."

Mitt: "Don..."
*Shhh*

Trump: "You've said enough. You know if, I know it, America knows it. You are going to make America great again, one burger at a time."

"Oh, and Tulsi likes her's medium-rare" 
hes getting the job, why else meet with him twice?
Trump is going to need a liaison, in some capacity, to the establishment republicans in congress.
Why on earth was he even floated for SoS?  Commerce, Interior, *anything* else made more sense.
Honestly as much as I wouldn't like it. Romney might not be so bad when you think of how much it would unite the party. If Romney is SOS we guarantee 8 years of the presidency. It will be like when Reagan won reelection. 
Trump is basking in his misery. 
Spicy
"So Princess Romney how's the soup? Ever have soup this good?!"
"Yes, on Alderaan!"

Ambassador to Alderaan confirmed!
I'd ream his ass for weeks and then in the end say "Fuck off dude, there's no way you'll ever be anyone in DC for the rest of your life. Bye."
"Please don't take my picture right now" -Mitt
Trump's facial expression is priceless. Hopefully it's saying romney youre out of here No job for you...
It's still possible..
Trump looks so fucking creepy here. Almost evil lol
Did Trump get another Taco Bowl?
Commander and Shitposter in chief. Dont let your memes be dreams. 
"pls help"
Reportedly eating FROG's legs for dinner?????
He looks... crestfallen
Good point
All I see is one guy wearing an American Flag pin, and another who is not.  

And that's all I need to know.

**HOLY SHIT MY SIDES**
DONT WATCH!!!

*little bites. little bites.*
nice glass of water you got there, Mittens. Careful not to spill any on your magic onesie.
I almost feel bad for him, almost.
Here comes the "he didn't do anything!   They were staying anyways!"
Already this PEOTUS is affecting my life. Shopping for next years Central AC replacement. Looks like I will need to consider one company I had ruled out. Fortunately, I still have nearly six months to see if this shakes out legitimately. 
Thank you, God Emperor.

What the fuck is wrong with these people? 
So tired of winning. (I'm not)
Germany is done. Thanks Angela.
Fucking Germany.

What if a bunch of white 12 year olds beat up a 70 year old muslim woman?
RELIGION OF PEACE
Probably because the kids were aged 12-15, but surely they learned their lesson and will lead non-violent lives with a focus on integrating into the culture that took them in.  
I was born in Germany while my father was stationed there, I've always wanted to visit but I think I'll stay here and focus on making American great again
Make no mistake: Germany is occupied.
I just don't see the Germans dealing with this for long. France & Italy are turning, England has already turned- the EU is done, globalists really overplayed their hand.

Germany is the primary financial engine of the EU, and it can't withstand continued stories like this for long and survive.
How can they call themselves officers of the law?
Are they trying to create vigilante gangs? Because this is how you create vigilante gangs...
I can't wait until President Trump meets Merkel.  
Well, I guess they've just thrown in the towel.  

And what's the chance that these "kids" are really 12-15? I've seen "teenage migrants" that look like they are in their late 30's.
For the third God damn time in a century... Just get the fuck out of here Germany
She refused to sell cigarettes to a bunch of 12-15 year old kids. Kids decide to beat up old lady. How fucking stupid do you have to be to let them go?

If the kids don't go to jail and her bruised face keeps showing up on German TV, this is exactly the sort of thing that leads vigilantism and breakdown of civil society. The police and prosecutors need to do their damn jobs and charge the kids with assault and theft and whatever they can prove in court and you know **pursue justice**. I wonder if there's a department for that like oh I don't know a Justice Department or whatever the German equivalent is. 

If they refuse to pursue charges or say anything on the basis that they don't want to appear racist then they're going to give a **wide berth** to actual racists to rise to power which is fucking scary in a place like Germany. 
>Age 12-15

More like 25-35
FUCK!
nothing new
Run by hypocritical, paid, radical feminists.
I support refugees and deporting migrants.

Exactly what SISI's would do.

Dream Fox line up would be Bret Baier at 6, Tucker at 7, Lou Dobbs at 8, Hannity at 9, and O'Reilly at 10, repeat as needed.  
We are obsessed with Tucker here in Cali... he's cool as a cucumber mowing these assholes down. It's tv gold....
The only way he is going to be beat is if Megyn Kelly comes on in her shortest skirt and best push up bra and interviews POTUS Trump for an hour and then...towards the end....tells him that she is sorry and sees him for his genius and supports him.   

That or Hannity on the view.    God that would be righteous.

And yes, not gonna lie I find Megyn Kelly somewhat attractive still.
The slaying is so brutal. I am hooked! Bless this patriot.

Tonight with Fariq was a bloodbath.
Can't cuck the Tuck. We played no small part in this lol.
Impressive comeback. Worked hard, got better at everything. Propably my favorite (msm) talking head.
Hacks BTFO
I have such a crush on him. 
At the end of his interview with a flag burning cuck he said, and I quote: "don't be a pig". 

#BASED TUCKER
Wow!
Good.  This man is based.  
That doesn't confirm it but you know he or someone close to him in his team does. They've gotta. Or at the very least they should, considering he wants to work for the people and we're a massive gathering of said people.
Can Confirm.  I'm woke as fuck
Trump made the post here
No doubt in my mind. He lurks or has lurkers.
http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/29/exclusive-how-trump-bypasses-corporate-media-reach-millions/

Maybe Dan Scavino lurks here   :D
I am hammering campus carry / gun-free zones because I want his team to see!
Cant find his tweet.
He did [confirm it at a rally actually](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5bsle1/nh_rally_117_trump_centipede_acknowledgement/). I knew it when he'd recite the wikileaks spicy bits that I had read here the previous day (if not just hours before) during his rallies many, many times.  
He retweeted a pepe in the dankest hours of the night a while back. This guy knows his memes and magicks
I think he shitposts here all the time.
/u/the-realdonaldtrump
I was 100% convinced when he hit the Pepe pose during his primary acceptance speech. This was after he tweeted the can't stump the trump with that image. He is among us for sure 
He should, and I hope he gets his news from here and not CNN. MAGA
**WOKE'ING INTENSIFIES**
Election Night. Super Tuesday, 2016. I was excited. I couldn‚Äôt wait for her to get in. I was ready to end centuries of the unfair oppression white men have done to women and minorities. I weep every day that I‚Äôm a white male. I cry. I apologize. But tonight, tonight it WILL BE HER TURN. I decided to take my allowance money earned from my parents and ride my bicycle to the grocery store. Tonight is special, I decided to go for the name brand extra crispy chicken tenders. I already had my favorite dipping sauces in order: buffalo hot sauce (wimpy flavor), barbeque sauce, ketchup and liberal tears of oppression. (I usually go for one dipping sauce per night, but this was a special occasion). You Drumpf supporters were finally going to realize I WAS RIGHT, DRUMPF WAS WRONG. But then‚Ä¶.the wins were coming in. The electoral votes were sweeping in. I was getting nervous, but I knew based on my research that Hillary was going to win. Look, I‚Äôm a pretty smart guy. I always go to the right unbiased news sources (HuffPost, WashingtonPost, CNN, etc.) because I know all other sources are wrong. But then Trump won Ohio, Florida‚Ä¶.and he won the night with the rust belt. I just don‚Äôt get it. I don‚Äôt understand how someone can have a different opinion than me. I guess racism, homophobia, facism and xenophobia won that night. If you didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary you are sexist. I weep. I weep because of how bad the economy is. My degree in psychology hasn‚Äôt landed me a job. I‚Äôm 125k in debt because of my psychology degree. It‚Äôs not my fault. You got your Drumpf. You made your bed you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Drumpf supporters. Now lay in it. 
I'm not surprised. Imagine if you found a website with a bunch of people talking about you. It would feel awesome.
#PRESIDENT TRUMP^IS^TOO^BASED
Just realized Twitter only gives you 140 characters so he did it in 280 or less. On time and under budget!
420 if ya counting 3 tweets
They really do not understand what is happening.

They are going to wake up in 8 years and be like:

"Huh? What they hell just happened?"
He really is skilled with handling confrontation. He gets his opposition to battle and belittle a position that they originally held and defended. He doesn't even have to refute their reply. He just lets the cognitive dissonance set in naturally and organically.
Yeap.  Browsing through the subreddits, the Leftists are saying that free speech should be defended even if the views are different from your own.

I'm like WTF.  These same people will try to destroy and silence any opinion that doesn't match theirs.  Trump has done it again.
I am already on the fifth #justsaying
It amazes me that people take Trumps statements seriously. He is a Troll, and a fantastic one at that. He is prodding the left to make them admit how hypocritical they are. He just ended the safe space, PC culture bullshit excuses forever by essentially condemning desecration of the flag.
fewer. 320 characters or *fewer*
Brilliant
They've been wrong about everything else this year. Surely they're right about this!
CNN should be sued out of existence 
CNN is on cable if they were on TV.. They would have been gawkered long ago. 
WHY?! Why should he have to get off twitter? Why the hell do I need all of his thoughts and statements filtered through the media?? 
Mainstream media has lost the drive, courage, honor and tenacity that used to characterize the news industry in this country. Now you will lose your jobs and advertisers along with your viewers. That is what happens when YOU SUCK.
Agreed
Soon, he should trade twitter for [gab.](https://gab.ai/) Twitter corporate hates him, and gab is built to replace twitter.
Of course they want Trump off social media. They don't want the public to hear any words from him without them being able to twist them first.
They say that because they're frightened of his narrative-shattering influence. 
And in other news.... Early "on-set" (< pun intended) dimentia is on the rapid increase and now poses one of the greatest single threats to the future of our Nation.
These are my favorite lib racists--the ones not clever enough to hide their agenda.
Wait, he fucking tweeted that reply **on the same day only a few hours after the first tweet where he literally tries to make the situation about race??!?!!** 

This is some next level lack of self-awareness right here. 
He's going on Tucker tonight. He thinks he's going to have an enlightened discussion. Poor guy doesn't realize he's walking into a buzzsaw primed to destroy his narrative.
SHAMEFUL
#OFTEN CONFUSED 
3 hours between tweets hahaha
Race baiting so they can call us racists. 
He is an idiot.

Get your shit together, think nationally act locally is what I say. Enough of these idiots. Let's start showcasing real Americans doing real good things and giving a good God damn about America!

>And here they go making everything about race

Did he really post this unironically? 
Its scary and frustrating that people can be this fucking retarded. I really dont even have words for this lol
But according to him, the first tweet has nothing to do with race. Source: That Tucker interview.
No idea who this guy is but he's obviously pushing buttons to get a reaction

The joke is like that tens of thousands of people here were like, no time for doubts, we're gonna fucking do it. This entire domreddit is us yelling LANDSLIDE for almost a year before the elections.

Thinking about it, banning this subreddit would be a crime against future historians. 
We should upvote the heck out of his posts, get his karma up.
The amount of salt he got that day.... 
To be fair it was a crushing defeat for down ballot Republicans in Nevada. Dems won almost everything unfortunately. This is due to a very strong Harry Ried machine controlling Nevada and very relaxed voter ID laws. 

I think a recount here would be bad for Clinton.

what post is this? can we reverse his/her/it's downvotes?

/u/BigBiggest is a prophet.
this must be false, as my gender studies teacher told me islam is a religion of peace. so ISIS must be lying trying to besmirch the lovely name of islam as ISIS isnt REAL islam. if the west didnt invade whogivesafuckistan this wouldnt happen.....therefore it was the US government's fault, the US is mostly White therefore its whites fault again therefore its my fault so i'm so sorry, won't happen again 

; )
Even ISIS doesn't care about the liberal narrative. In fact, they're probably getting pissed that FUCKING A WHITE MALE gets all their credit.
Every time this happens, people say "but they didn't *actually* organize it."

I don't give a fuck.

If they want to accept the repercussions of taking credit, that's fucking fine by me. More reason to send them some love, Air Force style. 
They take credit for every attack of this kind.
Meanwhile CNN anchors are still hard at work to find a motive.
Obviously this will be my fault in the MSM since I'M A FUCKING WHITE MALE!! TO THE TOP YOU GO!!!

If I turn on the MSM this evening, I now expect to hear the term "lone wolf" over and over and over.. mark my words. 
Yes, ISIS. Take credit for a failed attack meanwhile your army is getting the shit kicked out of them by the Russians and Serbians not to mention the rebel forces who think you're scum. Please import more dumb as rock soldiers from Africa and the rest of the Middle East since your main recruiter got his head blown off.

All of this happening while Saudi Arabia loses money and gun manufacturers cut them off. Love this timeline tbh
**But but but but but CNN says we're STILL SEARCHING FOR A MOTIVE!!!**
In other news water is wet
Those goat fuckers take credit for just about any little attack. All they want is attention.
Wow am I surprised! (I'm not)
Columbus is a very liberal city and this is a big wake up call. 
Given Wikileaks has revealed hard evidence that Oblama, Hilbully, Sorrows and friends funded, trained, armed, coordinated and sponsored ISIS.... Are they not subsequently sponsors of this recent ISIS terrorist attack at OSU?
Remember: Taking credit and planning are two different things.
Well of course they are going to take credit for it lol.

Does not compute. How do liberals deal with such cognitive dissonance?
When it sinks in, it's scary.

The left praising totalitarianism while going after free speech and free thought. 
The other thing that gets me is how the left still accuses Trump of being a pawn of Russia, when Castro was **literally** a pawn of Russia.
What's next, an American liberal revisionist history of the glories of Stalin?  
2016. Words, not actions, have become the more vile crime to the delusional left.
The other morning, my husband said "Fidel Castro died" in the exact tone he used when his aunt and uncle were killed in a car crash. First of all, I thought he was already dead for some reason. Second of all, who gives a crap? 
I can never remember the pecking order for liberal victim groups.
This dude tells the truth but I wish he'd quit ending everything with "let that sink in".
At this point, I think the reason the left doesn't praise Hitler is so they can bash dissenters with it.
I dont care. I'm sick as shit of people telling me to "Let that sink in". That's how a barista talks.  
Grab em by the pussy?  Asking for a friend. 
Ironically, "The Young Turks" is the name of the political movement that perpetrated the Armenian genocide.

Some genocides are more equal than others.  

My grandfather was forced to watch his father beheaded by the Turks, then came to America and saved his family from more oppression. 

He started a successful dental business and raised my father who became an Army Major veteran. 

Sad to see history repeating itself over 100yrs later with the genocide of Christian minorities in the Middle East.  Ashamed Turkey is a part of NATO.

Proud of my Armenian heritage, even more proud of America the beautiful. Looking forward to Trump recognizing the Genocide as our President!
Cultural marxism is strong with this one.

What's that term for when you leave a muslim country and emigrate to a non-muslim country and secretly overtake the new country so that Islam can flourish abroad?
Chunk yogurt is a fat lying fuck
This is akin to denying that the Holocaust happened, yes?

So why is he not being crucified by the left on the daily?

Oh, right. Facts don't matter.
I've watched their election night coverage 3 times.  It's the best one of all.
Guys a piece of shit.
My grandpa (rest in peace) who had to flee Turkey to Syria and lost everything would question that stance. Denying the genocide is a pretty big disconnect from facts though, is there some source where he actually says this?
get off the stage you fat fuck
It's funny that Kim Kardashian is outspoken about the Armenian genocide meanwhile this cuck perpetuates it by denying it

Love this picture. It's my profile picture on twitter

It's amazing how many triggered liberals don't even know who he IS.

"Creepy. Why is this old fuck replying to teenagers?"
"You're old as shit who cares what you think"

Just look at what happened to Kanye West. He said he'd have voted for Trump and they threw him in an mental hospital to brainwash him back.
Rosa im sorry to say,

##they hate you because you're beautiful.
Yes, because leftist logic dictates that minorities need to be saved. Once minorities disengage from beta SJWs and stray from the cozy narrative, the SJW is left feeling unneeded and his/her moral high-ground is leveled. The sense of confusion and insecurity that follows is easier left blocked out. Back to anger and loud voices! 
Absolutely. There is a double standard in this country and it needs to change criminals kill people on a daily basis and he hardly bat an eye yet when a police officer does it, we bitch and moan. It's almost as if we don't expect the police, those tasked with protecting us to commit criminal acts!  

We need to end this double standard!
The black community, like we learned about Killary herself from the podesta emails, is nothing more than a profit center for liberals and their ilk. What I've seen with this election is blacks awakening to  this because, as one black friend put it, they are no longer the left's favored minority anymore. It seems to be muslims.
I absolutely believe it.  As an atheist conservative,  I get a lot of hate from liberal atheists, but I haven't gotten any hate from religious conservatives.
They're "for" you, as long as you'll stay on the Democratic plantation.  
There is a black man going on a tirade about how the cop who killed the terrorist is a "racist" because he is white. A black girl called him on his bullshit and he responded to her with a gif of a woman in a movie who represented a "house n****r". Basically calling this girl that.
This this and so much more this! I've never been shut down and mistreated so much in my entire life for being a minority woman that has used her brain in this election. SAD 
and someone posted yesterday the bs @youngblackcon is receiving--I followed her and this morning she is receiving more! She could use some backup please! 
Ugh..... another  typical white male trapped  in a hot black chicks body.
That's why they call it the liberal plantation.
Leftists see minorities as pets.

Notice how the commercials about donating "just 40 cents a day" or whatever to save African children from hunger are eerily similar to the ones about rescuing abused animals? They play the Sarah McLaughlin "in the arms of the angel" sad music over images of starving flea ridden dogs/cats/African boys.

White leftists all fantasize about adopting poor minoroties like they're rescuing a pitbull from the pound. Look at Angelina Jolie's collection!

They truly think of Africans as a subhuman species in need of white masters to feed and house them. And yet somehow we're the racists for thinking they can survive(and often thrive) under the same expectations as the white man.
GET THIS LADY A COAT!!!
So I guess many blacks listened to Trump when he said "what have you got to lose?".  
Black conservatives are rare but holy fuck they are woke.

"Bring then to heel" - Hillary Clinton
wew lass
Been there, done that, got the tshirt. Seriously, the only people who ever try to bring my race into any argument or discussion are liberals arguing with me about my politics. Outside of that, besides hispanics trying to speak Spanish to me because they can't differentiate between a red skinned Injian and a Central American (Only annoying, was alot more irritating growing up in Dallas) and blacks who seem to look at me negatively for the same assumptions, the only legitimate incident of racism I received from a white group was when I started dating my wife (whose white) and her bosses at the department store she worked at started treating her very poorly because of who she was dating. A very distinct change in how several of her managers were treating her because I'd come to have lunch with her. That's it.

Everything else has been people I've been friends with or some random white person on a friends facebook posts trying to accuse me of being an uncle tom or trying to use my race against me without understanding I know a hell of alot more about my race than they do.

Fun Fact: Did you know that the slave trade wasn't just Europeans trading with other Europeans? But for a good 100-200 years that they were very actively trading with the native nations? Betcha they don't tell you that about us! They also don't tell you that we had writing systems (Some used a series of braided knots as a form of writing) and currency (Wampum, a type of Quohog seashell used in jewlrey) and economy and trade and a very strong, detailed political system (Ex: The Powhatan confedracy, which controlled an area of land larger than the British Isles before the British Settlers took over) and even made a man made mountain larger than the pyramids of Giza? (Cahokia) Fucking cucks trying to tell me my history! Only want to use it for their own political gain.
> Liberals: We want blacks to be successful!

But when a black person stops doesn't listen to degenerate rap music (encouraging becoming a drug dealer or hitman), stops doing drugs that harm the brain and cause addictions, stops skipping class and starts studies for a successful future, they receive hate.

Nothing made liberals more angry than when black people were the main opposers of gay marriage. Their response was "you guys are supposed to be on OUR side and do what WE say because we know what's best for YOU"
Whats her full name so we can follow, like, and retweet this based female American?!
God damn right!
Patronizing in every way
It's called going off the reservation, or off the plantation.  And guess who thinks they run the reservation and the plantation.  That would be insufferable sanctimonious virtue-signaling white liberals.
You become an "uncle Tom".
"It is a high tech lynching for uppity blacks who, in any way, deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas. And it is a message that, unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you: you will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured" - Clarence Thomas, 1991.

(Bob "KKK" Byrd voted against him)
Liberal mentality "now now be a good little minority and let us feed you the lies and rob you of rational thought so we can continue using you as pawns" but it don't want to! " you damn Uncle Tom racist !! "

SMH...
We love everyone, we may not like your point of view but it's your right to think for yourself..therein lies the difference between that way of thinking and ours.
Democrats always hated it when their slaves got off the plantation.
She doesn't even need to be conservative to realize this. Just woke fam.
ben carson was right again
In regards to blacks, in 2016 democrats call you an "uncle tom" if you don't go along with their beliefs, in 1956 they called you "uppity negros", in 1906 they just called you "Klan fodder", and in 1856 they called you "property"
Don't block out her name! I want to follow that patriot! 
If I had a dollar every time I have been called an "uncle tom" for being a conservative I would be able to pay for all the programs democrats push to "help" minorities.
I can 100% confirm this as true. I get this shit from my own family. Just makes me lock in harder for conservativism. 
ATTA GIRL! TELL IT LIKE IT IS.
How did the country breed such hypocrites? I guess leadership plays a huge role in any society. 
CATCHING ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Go Rosa!
It's like liberals only function through ideas, as in, they have a certain idea of how it's like to be a minority and then apply that to everyone. 

When someone comes out and tells them that they're wrong, they flip out because it's not just that one case that gets thrown in the dirt but their entire frame of reference gets "attacked" with reason and experience.

  
The liberals ultimately, secretly think that blacks are inferior, evidenced by how they don't think blacks can think for themselves and that liberals must do their thinking for them.
It saddens me so much to see the narrative, the only one so many Americans hear, is controlled by racist liberals. Don't get me wrong, I respect their right to be racist. That's liberty, I don't get to decide how others think and talk. What upsets me is that they get to be racist and control the media that says they're not.
u/orionsbell  
There are more of us.  
tommy sotomayor said the same thing. and its still true. 
They want Rosa in the back of the Democrat bus.
You may be black, you may be a woman (if the thumbnail is accurate), you may be conservative, but you are an American and human being above all else.  We all can disagree with policies, values, and the direction of this country, but we are all in this together.  

Sometimes this means letting people who live elsewhere who think differently live their lives the way they want to live.  Sometimes it means living with policies you disagree with decided by more people you disagree with.  Sometimes it means that the majority can't rule over the few.

But these differences between us are not things or labels to keep us separated or mean someone's opinions or life is more valuable because of the labels they have collected, but our differences is the fulcrum that offers everyone differing perspectives to understand the totality of humanity.  To understand how different policies or values effect everyone and how we as American's can decide how to Make America Great.
I really don't get what it is about being on the right of the political spectrum that is apparently something blacks can't be 
me too.  That's why trump isn't racist.  It's the liberals that are racisists 
Based pretty lady.  This kind of stuff has always really got to me.  We know the lefts are batshit crazy.  They point at anything and cal it racist. But they are so quick to turn on minorities who dont think like them.  Call them uncle toms,  etc.  This is actually one of the most racists things ive seen in my lifetime.  This and the ongoing war on  white males. 

 One of the most patriotic things I can think of is a black person waving an american flag or wearing MAGA swag.  It truly is.  
That's what happens when you try to wander off their social justice plantation. 

[Just a reminder that actions speak louder than words](http://imgur.com/a/tXvZT)
This pisses me off so much! So basically these people are saying forget about the bit where Martin Luther King exhorted America to leave people the hell alone and allow everyone to be the INDIVIDUALS they WANTED to be (or that God intended.)  I am friendly with a guy who escaped from El Salvador. He was tortured by the military junta just  because he was poor and a native Indian. He had scars so deep on his back that you could put your fingers into them. When he got to the US, he was given sanctuary by some "open-minded" folks UNTIL he refused, after 2 years, to be dragged around wearing a serape to their fundraisers. All he wanted was to be a FREE man. They hated him for "talking back". He split from their "patronage" and on his own, taught himself to read, got a GED, a girlfriend, an old truck and started a successful landscaping business.  These "well-intentioned" narcissists are the WORST...nobody in the US should EVER explain their right to be an individual to a tribunal of  self-righteous asshats, who haven't spent 10 minutes in the real world. Nobody HAS TO "wear the serape" ever!

She looks like a model, with intellect to boot.  She's 100% correct.  Americans all over are waking up to fact the Dem's like us poor, naive, and obedient.  It's a disgusting truth.  
Been said this
And the bigger reason why Blacks don't admit who they vote for.

Sucks, however that's slowly changing - the Democrat con is up and many are beginning to realize it's ok to become unshackled.

Join the team!
It's true. People that claim to be tolerant are so until you disagree then they go full hate speech on you.

The right does need to do more to attract sane people on the left. Maybe tone some things down....
When you're young, Will looks like the cool one.

When you're older, you know the real hero is Carlton.
Damn, I'd console her anytime.
You ever stop and think that Leftists aren't satisfied until you are dead? 



They poison our food, put our children in danger. Drive divisive wedges into our families and homes, then brainwash us into believing that the Left way is the best way. 



Leftism will never go away because evil must be defeated daily. But maybe for our lifetimes we put warnings in place for future generations. 
She is so right. Step out of line with the left and you'll find out what complete racist scum they truly are. You'll hear the most racist shit ever: Uncle Tom, race traitor, Stepin Fetchit, the n-word, all the usual shit the left thinks about black people, but bite their tongue until someone steps out of line.

But don't ask cis white male scum like me. Ask Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell, Ben Carson, Alan Keyes, hell even Kanye. Successful conservative black Americans are too dumb to know what's best for them according to the left.

Most racist fucks imaginable.
God bless this woman.

The real purpose of the NAACP was to defeat the one true Black leader -- Booker T. Washington and to induce Blacks to Marxism.
Damn she's gorgeous
That's why the Left platform as we know it today cannot exist because it's based on divide and hate.  
nah rosa you are wrong. they hate you cause ur sexy af.
So like the real question is.... anyone going to talk about how cute she is? 
Dude. I slapped some asshole for using the term "uncle Tom".
Just my 2 cents....me have to stop this majority/minority black,white,brown,etc racial thing....this is America, we are ALL red white and blue!!! Until the majority of our citizens think this way, we will always have division
Slave owners back in the day didn't teach their slaves how to read because they feared that if the slaves were educated then they would turn on them. Even today the left likes it when minorities are uneducated.
liberals hate everyone that thinks for themselves. 'you have a brain?' --- 'you're racist, sexist, and all of the -isms!'
Liberals are for liberals, anything else they say is a farce.
Liberals and liberalism needs to end
Liberals are all about helping minorities, as long as they think and act the way they want them to. 
Democrats want their slaves back.
I remember sanders supporters dropping some casual racism in their sub when hernie sanders lost.

Rita's a conservative columnist in Australia, with an Iranian background. She's constantly getting trolled by the tolerant left, who think it's okay to tell her to go back to where she came from.
Much like a cult.

One of my black centipede colleagues at work experienced this. I'll call him 'Based Nate'. 

Anyway, one of my SJW coworkers was walking through our office and stopped by Nate's desk. Now this guy almost never talks to Nate other than brief hellos. Based Nate sits right next to me, so after hanging out a couple times I learned about his politics. 

So the SJW stops by and just randomly says, 'Hey Nate, sucks about the election, huh? Now we have a racist in office." 

When I heard that, I suffered sympathy cringe because I knew what was coming. Nate's eye got huge and he said, "Who the fuck wanted Hillary Clinton in office? If anything, she's the racist and definitely a criminal. Get outta here with that nonsense."

They went back and forth for a little bit, but my point is, this SJW assumed Based Nate's political leaning because he's black. Dude is an absolute centipede and nimble navigator. 

tj;dr, the left is full of racists dipshits. 
Who dat? I want to buy her an expensive steak dinner
As a black conservative myself, this is what I face on a daily basis... even amongst my liberal former friends. All my "liberal" friends, distance themselves with me and then ask me "why do you have more whites... why are you hating yourself"? It's not me hating anything but me waking up from the deprived mind control that I've been under since birth; more like, I'm actually a smart individual, with my own mind who knows when to avoid hive mentality.

It's even worst being that I'm the ONLY black, Christian, conservative on my college campus (it's an HBCU for those who wondering)!
Dems have never liked it when "their Blacks" get all "uppity".
Before you are anything... you are a KNOCK OUT! Beautiful :O
lol so fake
Illegals would never break the law, would they?
Trump can say the sun rises in the east and they'd dispute it.
# LESS THAN 1 MINUTE STICKY.
There are more barriers to cash a check than to vote 
We have tons of anecdotal evidence of illegals voting! 

In addition, we have one survey that has the following information:

#15% of illegals have admitted to registering to vote

And that's just the ones that confessed. It's likely much more!
A liberal yesterday said to me "How could illegals vote? They aren't citizens!"
Let's not forget that Obama essentially said it was ok for illegals to vote. 

That they wouldn't face punishment for committing **Voter Fraud**!

Russian KGB hacking to overthrow the US government: believable

Illegals who are already committing a crime by being here voting: insane

What a magical land these people live in.
We need a constitutional amendment for strong voter I.D. laws. While I believe in states rights for a great number of issues, this should be a federal mandate as to prevent illegals across the board from having the vote.
Wow, double whammy. Multiple layers of triggering. 

spez: I read about the voting procedure in America my jaw dropped. I'm only one year older than my country's democracy and even we have better voter regulaton.
No because that would be illegal, and illegal immigrants are a group of people that would never break a law in order to help and serve themselves.  

Seriously, think about it you racist! Why would you think an illegal alien would be the type of person to commit an illegal act that is very easy to get away with, just to advance themselves and their families further?

You racists are so ignorant. 
#BASED BILL WITH THE DAILY DOSE OF RED PILL TRUTHS
THAT STICKY SPEED

MODS ARE GODS
I think we can audit states like California without an recount. It would be nice to do samples of counties in red and blue states and verify the people etc . Let's not fool ourselves though. Democrats keep the rules loose for an reason and it's not for the good.

Folks. We have millions of people over 100 years old on social security receiving checks. They are dead.

If you were an illegal voter in the last election, then you should be deported and barred from re-entry.
Uh oh, here comes someone with logic.  Time for cucks to curl up into their safe spaces
anybody got links to actual numbers for redpilling purposes?
THANK YOU!

Why don't we push this more?

If I understand it correctly - and I'm just a dumb german fuck - all you need in - for example California is a DRIVERS LICENSE to vote! And illegals can get those easily.

If that is true - Why should they not vote? I bet dems even HELP them to.
And not just illegals.  I wonder how many green card holders, H1-B card holders, "refugee status" people and assorted others also vote?

There has to be a state-by-state review.  Followed by a mandatory cross-referencing of states so people who go to college in one state and maintain their "home" in another are either blocked from double voting (absentee) or on notice that if they do so there is a REAL risk of being stuck with a criminal record.

Also, only CITIZENS should count for apportionment on the next census.
We have the quickest stickies!
I got made during the election that the MSM kept harping about how trump was going to lose because he would lose the Latino vote (illegal immigrant vote) because his stance on border patrol. IF the illegals become a voting bloc that isnt something to be celebrated that is a problem that needs fixing. In my mind there shouldn't even be  a Vote Aqui.
considering I never see anyone at polling places ask for proof of voter eligibility other than if your xeroxed signature is in the sign in roll from last time. No ID check to make sure it actually IS you, nothing to check if your voting privilege got taken away due to felony conviction, no check of citizenship...I'd say odds are 99.9999999999999999% there were massive amounts of illegals voting.
>There's no evidence of voter fraud!

No shit asshole, because no one even tries to track it.  I left a bowl of candy on my porch on halloween with a sign that said "take one."  When I got home, the bowl was empty.

Sure, there's no actual evidence that anyone took more than one, because I did absolutely nothing to keep track of how many people came, and made no effort to monitor the bowl.  The left's logic is ridiculous.
to vote in my riding in Vancouver, BC, Canada for our last federal election -- my name was already on the registered voters' list (I had voted previously).  At the DESIGNATED polling place (they had my name on a list there), I had to show personal ID (passport) AND a piece of mail (bill for hydro/cable or credit card company, something "official" like that) addressed to me with the same address on it as the one for which I was registered.  All the major parties had individuals at the polling place FOR SCRUTINY purposes.  All ballots are paper, and they are hand counted.  

Our election results are normally meaningfully tabulated and "called" within 3-4 hours of the west coast polls closing.  Any close races are automatically recounted, again by hand, and again with any representatives of political parties who want to observe.

Quite frankly, what you guys do in the United States -- shocking to me!!!  No one complains about the voting system in Canada, not any of the parties (we have minimal gerrymandering, although it does happen, and any vote redistribution is always done with trying to not "offend Quebec").  Simply put, in Canada, you have to win the hearts and minds of the voters, and you have to get your vote out and to the polling places on voting day (and we do have advanced polls as well, run as the same tight ship).
Let's see how Steins initiative goes then. If there is widespread voter fraud, we need to find it and stamp it out. 
Maggot Kelly is a dumb phony bitch who thinks she's responsible for her father's death and never got over it.
Damn this guy is awesome.
They obviously don't believe it, otherwise they wouldn't fight so hard to make sure illegals can vote.

Two thirds of mexicans in the US stated their loyalty was first and foremost to Mexico. I don't see any incentive here to influence our elections.

Why would they vote? It's not like the PRESIDENT of the United States told them to do so or any crazy shit like that!
There's also a lot more incentive to cross the border than vote.
They don't even check your I.D. What an absolute joke. 
When I moved to a new jurisdiction. it was easier for me to get a library card than to register to vote. The library made me prove I lived at the address I listed, when registering to vote they just took my word for it.

Keep in mind that Trump didn't tweet that illegals voted.  He said that there were illegal votes.  That could be illegals, but it could also be citizens committing vote fraud.
Well NYT did a study and its not statistically proven. So Carlos Slim said voter fraud doesn't exist. Obama doubled down on it. I am sure it was verified by the top scientists at fuckmywife university. 
I have no data but I really believe that the chance that millions of illegals voted is higher than the chance Russian hackers infiltrated the machines...

might i add that those machines are owned by George Soros who is a well known financial backer of the Clintons and a known enemy of democracy 

I'd also like to say that it's total propaganda that Russia has been involved in our recent news cycle. Shit has no basis and is all made up to divert attention from what's in those wikileaks (PODESTAAA WE HAVE YOUR EMAILS!)
We saw lots of instances where Democrats bussed citizens around polling areas to vote multiple times.  We saw many people bragging on Facebook and Twatter that they voted multiple times.  It's not too hard to figure that illegals would also have voted especially in areas where they were mixed in with citizens in high numbers.  We also saw Obummer telling them in a speech that they would not be in trouble if they voted.  The DNC made a big play for the Hispanic vote to keep Trump from being elected. 

For those liberals that don't see anything wrong with non citizens voting then consider that every one of their votes has the potential of cancelling out a citizen's vote and that is WRONG.  We don't go to their country and vote illegally.  They should not be able to vote in ours.  Not one vote until you are a citizen.

They have the gall to say "but they haven't been caught so there is no evidence." How delusional do you have to be to think no one took advantage of the fact that California will give anyone a license and then automatically register them to vote. 
The MSM hides this information just as they did the O'keefe videos.
[voter fraud](http://therightscoop.com/watch-new-bombshell-video-just-released-james-okeefe-mass-voter-fraud/)

There are sure a lot fewer barriers to vote for illegal immigrants than there are for Russians to access voting machines not connected to the Internet.

Yet MSM is bending over backwards telling us they are sure Putin send his agents from Russia to hack our machines (which are not connected to the internet), while hand waving allegations of illegal immigrants voting.
Pretty clear that illegals voted.  

For illegals, this election was polarized to basically this: 

**If Candidate A:**  WALL + DEPORT + NO SENDING MONEY "HOME"

**If Candidate B:**  AMNESTY + CITIZENSHIP + DREAM ON!

They voted... and a thorough evaluation of voter rolls would prove it.
It's probably an issue of them believing/feeling that the votes are valid.
Thieves break into your house but it's absurd to say that they then steal things once they're inside!
But npr told me these were false claims and they got some nerdy guy to tell me why I should believe in the sanctity of voting machines made by private companies that could have compromised code.

Machines make the process inherently vulnerable, not safer. NPR is straight up propaganda at this point. What the fuck happened? 
but I thought they were too busy keeping the entire American economy afloat with their cheap labor?!?!?!
Dont get separated in the process of our goverment deatroying this earth and everything in it. 
Provisional ballots? Yes they can vote but it's not counted as they can't be confirmed eligible. 
Wouldn't it be simpler to have voter registration tied to your drivers license or government issued ID? It expires when your DL expires or Gov ID. You have to renew that ID anyway so why not just register everyone to vote with a valid ID? When the election rolls around you just print off the names / address' of people who live in the area and boom, voter registration rolls.

Why do we have a whole seperate dept for voter registration? The DMV should do it. It should be the same system. You want to vote? Go get a Government ID. (usually a dr license) Passports are handled on the federal level I believe so I don't think they'd be a good ID to connect voter registration too but most people go to a dmv office in the county they live in so it should be an easy thing to handle for the DMV.
The media were openly engaging in a bit of semantical fuckery trying to say that only "illegal aliens" couldn't legally vote.

Which is the same as suggesting that green card holders can legally vote.

Green card holders absolutely positively cannot legally vote!  ...Yet they are illegally voting. And the current criminal in chief was on TV encouraging it!
Still, it seems like a question of risk-reward issue.

Illegaly voting might end up getting you deported. And the direct benefit of voting is pretty much zero, especially when Trump wins anyway. 



The media is colluding with election fraud.
This guy is so fucking based he probably leaks radiation
> I mean, there are fewer barriers to voting than to getting here and they got here."

Wat? One of the tougher western countries to get a green card to lol what's he talking about.
Most illegals are perfectly willing to pose as US citizens / legal residents to obtain work by stealing SS numbers - why do people think they wouldn't be willing to lie about their citizenship to steer an election in their favor?

Not just illegals, but even the legal immigrants, felons, etc.

In California, you need a Driver's License and to sign a form saying you are totally a citizen.

Love how the media says over and over again, "NO PROOF" but then doesn't admit they've never actually taken time to look over all the proof that is out there. In their minds, if they don't report it, it never happened.
Bill is on it.
Am Californian, hear me out-

It's not all the rest of the state... it's not many of the 'normal' suburbs... it's not San Francisco, it's not the outskirts... it's the shitholes like East L.A. etc... where I have no doubt some illegal voting does occur.  In areas where the population is 100% latino that I doubt the integrity of their ability to turn away illegals from voting.

When EVERY SINGLE PERSON involved in the entire local voting process is PRO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT, there's nothing stopping them from assuring they can vote.  When every person in the room supports it, there's nothing to stop it.  Cities like Huntington Park where they have illegal immigrants as appointed city officials is where this happens... everyone there even the lawmakers want illegals to partake in government... and no one there is against it.
Wasn't it estimated that over 3 million illegal immigrants voted in the US general election this year? Funny, considering Hillary's "winning margin". I wonder how many of them voted for President-elect Trump....
They've just been spinning it trying to connect it to PV claims saying that they were "illegally voting" instead of "illegals voting."

Little nuanced but that's what they're trying to do to delegitimize the claim.

Do I think over 2 million voted?  Not sure, but it's not as impossible as the left and MSM is trying to paint it as.  I'm all for maximum turnout, but the laws in states like California are too lax in the wrong places.

Spez:  I fucking *love* our MODS for making Edit into Spez, I just noticed this.
No, they just apply common sense and figure that the odds of 3 million illegals (that would be about 1/3 of all illegal immigrants) overwhelmingly casting invalid votes for one side seems pretty far fetched.  Repeated studies about vote fraud find very little of it occurs, so the onus is on the accusers to find the 3 million invalid votes.
I am against this ALL CAPS movement #noallcaps
Lol people here are so radicalized.  Well at least y'all aren't outside hitting ppl with cars and knifing them
I don't get why the media must defend this notion. Isn't it their job to ask questions and be exploratory/curious; not to defend the voting system. That's not their job!
Millions of illegals vote. It's so bad that some states have rewritten their boards of elections to make it nearly impossible to challenge their votes, by forcing only people in the district to have the capability to challenge ballots, and by rewriting laws so you can only challenge single ballots, not groups of ballots.
I have a question: how is it possible for undocumented immigrants to vote and skew election results? When I voted at my local voting place, they asked me my name and checked that I was on the roster for voters of that area. I signed a piece of paper that confirmed my name and address, and the volunteers crossed my name off of the roster (I presume to signify that I had voted). Losing my ability to vote because an undocumented immigrant has fraudulently voted as me would take away my ability to vote but not inflate the number of votes for a candidate. 

Thanks. 

- I live in NC 

Serious question, trying to understand this. 
That's exactly why Jill Stein will never recount CA votes...she knows that an illegal would never break the law. And she says that the recount isn't being done to benefit anyone. That's why she's going for the states that really meant something to Hillary but Trump thumped her in. DO THE TRUMP THUMP! THUMPIN' TRUMP!
When we create voter ID laws, there needs to be some sort of consequence for those who are illegal.  Ims should deport them and every one of their family members status should be verified.  That should keep the illegals from voting.

That stuff is Diabetes in a box...
youre not missing much boycotting this crap.... aside from all the glyphosate (roundup ready pesticide). Kellogg has some of the highest concentrations found in their products.
Doesn't anyone remember the founder of Kellogg? He furiously advocated male and female circumcision to prevent masturbation. The original Corn Flakes formula was designed to lower men's libido.
Kellogg? YUCK!

Real centipedes eat Post Honey Bunches.
I haven't eaten any of that shit since I was a stupid child who didn't care what I put in my body. I will continue to not eat it, only now I will be even happier now knowing that I don't.
What I love about all these failing junkfood corporations not supporting Trump is that boycotting them will make us healthier and support more local farms and jobs.

Good riddance. Make America Healthy Again

Health ‚â† Junkfood diet + Shitty free pharma meds
If you eat grains you're a faggot. 
I always preferred the imitation stuff that comes in a bag.
Meh I buy the Aldi brand anyway
Fuck Kellogg's. 
Nobody threw a hissy fit over Breitbart until Trump appointed Bannon.


Shit cereal is shit.
Son of a bitch.  Their Raisin Bran has been my favorite for over 40 years.  Now I have to switch to the inferior Post brand.

Dammit.


We need to write to these companies to express our concerns when they do shit like this

Shouldn't be eating that crap anyway. Sugar, excess carbs, empty calories. Cereal is so good. But it makes you fat.
Alrighty then.  Kellogg's added to my 'no buy' list‚ùå
It's wonderful when corporations like this are called out, our numbers actually make a difference as shown with Pepsi and Grubhub. Corporations don't rule the consumers, consumers rule the corporations.
God dammit Kellogg's! I eat like 3-4 boxes of your cereal a week! Fuck! Oh well, bacon is better anyway. Fuck you Kellogg's! 
Here is the email I just sent them.

Dear Sir/Madam

I am very concerned that you are pulling advertising from a news website because it has a perceived conservative bias. 
Conservativism, patriotism and having right wing opinions does not automatically equal hate speech, racism or whatever obia or ism that you want to use that day.
Until you apologise for generalising right wing opinion as hate speech I will no longer be purchasing any of your products and neither will my wife or children.

I think it is probably worth mentioning that I'm British, live in the UK and that your tales of bigotry spread over the ocean. 
Across the planet, those that have not been indoctrinated into the quasi religion that is political correctness will not take kindly to your slander and cultural Marxism. 

Regards 
Anyone else miss Flutie Flakes?
They're only hurting themselves.
It's candy for breakfast.  Bad news!
Every time I see one of these companies make a decision like this it saddens me because I never bought their product in the first place.
Two things:

* From Wikipedia: **The company's brands include Froot Loops, Apple Jacks, Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Special K, Cocoa Krispies, Keebler, Pringles, Pop-Tarts, Kashi, Cheez-It, Eggo, Nutri-Grain, Morningstar Farms, and many more. Kellogg's stated purpose is "Nourishing families so they can flourish and thrive."** Looks like we have more to boycott. 
* [Harvey Kellogg was a weird guy](http://m.mentalfloss.com/article.php?id=27016)
FU Kellogg and your shitty cereals . Easy boycott, I already was.
Store brands ftw
Cereals are a waste of money anyways. They're just a bunch of refined grains with sugar added and sprayed with vitamins so they can pretend to be healthy. They're one of the biggest food scams around and everyone is better off not eating them.

Kellog served Corn Flakes at his sanitarium as part of his bland, vegetarian diet, thinking that such a diet would promote celibacy. As they say, the rest is history.
I buy unsweetened cereals and put artificial sweetener on it anyways. Sugar/corn syrup are calories for suckers.
Dont eat that shit. Even if they supported Trump.
American oats and honey!
[deleted]
I buy the Millville brand sold at Aldi which are oddly enough also called Frosted Flakes.  They are as good if not better than the original as are most of the Millville knockoffs.  But yes, I'm all up for eggs and bacon.  But it has to be American bacon because Canadian bacon, a.k.a. ham in the USA, doesn't cut it.
Who buys brand name cereal anyways?  The same stuff is in the box next to it marked with generic store brands.  And of course, if you have a house full of kids,  those 10 pound bags on the bottom shelf are the only way to go.
Raisin Bran is for pussies anyway
Yes,  fk Kellogg's 
General Mills is not on a shitlist yet, right? RIGHT?! Cause I need my Cheerios.
Sugar delivery system - 10% - avoid if at all possible    
Kellogg sales are down bigly in the UK anyway, people are moving away from cereals.
Everybody turn off ad block for breitbart
Frosted Snowflakes?
I'd boycott it but I don't eat garbage 
Bad move for a cereal company to alienate consumers. Millennials are barely eating cereal at all. No shit, it's not even fit for cattle or horses.
Yes time to eat healthy. Kellog's products are filled with crap.
More shitty products I haven't bought in decades. But it still pisses me off how messed up the "hate speech" definition is changing. The propaganda has been insane these past 3 years. 
We don't have any Kellogg cereal, and we sure as heck won't have any in the future. 
To be fair I stopped a lot of Kellogg's a long time ago. Most of their food tastes like cardboard. 
Oh no goodbye Tony the Tiger. 
Fuck them. I like the Publix brand better anyway.
no more Kellogg for me. 
Remember, these were the cucks who dropped Michael Phelps after a picture of him with a bong surfaced. They've long hated America, so don't eat the trash food the manufacture.
Real men eat Bacon & Eggs for breakfast anyways. Cereal is for kids or man-children. 
Eh, who needs them?  I'm on a low carb diet anyway.  
I like General Mills' cereals more anyways...
I buy the stuff in the bag anyway, pretty sure it has a new name every time I get it.
Way ahead on this one since I  wasn't too keen on Urine being an ingredient. 
It's better to go for actual cereal anyway, like oatmeal, farina, grits, cracked wheat berries, etc instead of this extruded snack-food crap.
"Civilized community fears backlash from savage Muslims" is irrelevant I guess
Everything wrong with the mainstream media is right in this article title. Who cares about the victims or the hero that prevented a greater tragedy- let's focus on the attacker, because identity politics dictates proving Muslims aren't Islamic terrorists....seriously, that's messed up.
I know this whole post is funny but the funniest thing about OPs submission is 

>liberal logic

HAHAHA
If obama had a son would he have looked like the OSU attacker too?
The Radical Muslim cries out in pain as he stabs you in the throat..
They fear backlash?  Well I fear getting Allahu Ackbarred!
Won't anyone think of those poor terrorists?
If only they could go somewhere where Islam is the primary religion and there is no general, daily violence toward anyone -- including and especially Muslims. It doesn't exist because in the presence of Islam there is no peace.

There are good people that are Muslims, but that doesn't mean Islam is not the problem. I get that people are people and will be violent despite religion or association, but there is no other religion that transforms cities into warzones or unleashes daily terror on unsuspecting innocents or completely invades and commands one's way of life with total loss of personal freedom and choice. Ask gays, women, atheists, or people of other religions who have fled Muslim countries about their quality of life. Now see if you can find a single example of any one person who has fled from *anywhere in the world* to a Muslim region in order to find freedom from religious tyranny.
That is the headline we have seen after EVERY terror attack.

Even though a backlash has NEVER happened, even after 911.
I remember when I heard about the Brussels attacks early this year. That was around the time Trump was getting flak from the press for suggesting we should ban foreign Muslims temporarily. And then I remember seeing that before those terror attacks Trump had made a remark not long before that Brussels was a hellhole. All of that didn't quite redpill me yet but that was when I first thought "yeah, this guy is gonna be president".
#FUCK RADICAL ISLAM AND FUCK WHOEVER DEFENDS IT  
"The white community fears backlash as the KKK burns down a black church and paints Trump on it"

Although we all know a liberal probably did that, this is the same "logic"
Underlying message:

Muslim attacks are justified and to be expected

You are really the root cause

When they occur you are not to assume it's islamic

Not to say islamic terrorism or radical jihad, etc.

You are not to surveil their mosques or retaliate against the attacks in any way

To do so is to invite more slaughter and recruit more terrorists

Just shut up and take it, infidels.
Liberals don't have logic
I've from the UK and I've been waiting for this so-called backlash for years. After the summer of terror there was nothing.

Muslims kill people and yet we are supposed to feel guilty? Fuck off
Maybe they should fear backlash. I'm russian, if Russians started creating terror in America I wouldn't be surprised if there was backlash, it's called common sense. I would also do what I can to talk some common sense into other russian to quit oh I dunno, killing everyone?!
I'm ashamed to ever call my self a liberal. 
They should. Fuck Mohammedites. Anyone who follows the word of Mohammed  is, by definition, an potental tettorist. The muslim books are instruction guides, not a collection of stories, like the bible.
Muslims are the true victims of Islamic terror in the same way that dog owners are the true victims of dog attacks.  Living in proximity to the danger just increases the risk.  But if we all brought a dog into our homes, then there'd be just as many (or more, in all likelihood) non-Muslim victims.
2 minute sticky?

I think we are going to see more of these type of notes. They are getting smarter they realize pure terror will makenus stronger. Now they are going to do their evil killings in the name of US oppression. It sounds like lunacy because the level of hypocracy but the liberals will eat that shit up w a spoon like we are seeing now. 
It's true that one of the motives of the terrorists is to isolate Muslims and prevent them from assimilating.
This is literally all they are worried about. Fuck the people who got cut up and ran over right? We have to worry about the backlash towards muslims! I mean what the fuck man.
If the Muslim community knew true fear, such incidents would not have occurred. They would either rein in their own jihadi tendencies, or rein in on the people around them.

Just liberals twisting the narrative and portraying Muslims as poor victims, due to 'oppression'. Lefties love this big 'O' word.
they should fear backlash. not violent backlash but social backlash. they need to self police. these assholes make the whole religion look like shit. 

if a group of my friends and I go out should they not be held accountable if I am picking fights with everyone we come across? They need to either control me or kick me out of the group. 
Liberal logic is what I'm going to be saying a lot today. 
If only they had more prayer rooms
Maybe the Muslim community in this country should be a little more vocal in condemning this kind of crap.
It's arrogant as hell to declare Muslim communities the only victims of terror attacks, but I do think there are at least a few decent, actual moderate Muslims out there who are rightly afraid of backlash. It's like when dark-skinned Indians and Sikhs were victims of hate crimes after 9/11 by retards who didn't know any better.

Not that the media cares about showing both sides of the story.
The ctl-left are ignorant assholes. Anything to distract from the actual problem and prop up the narrative. 
There hasn't been serious backlash since after 9/11, when Muslims killed 3000 Americans. Even then Sikhs took most of the punishment. I'm sure you'll be fine. 
It would make a lot of sense to people who think women have always been the primary victims of war. 
CNN ("POSSIBLE TERRORISM is the motive") just had a blonde wobbleheaded "terrorism expert" on who effusively praised the fact that no GUN was available to the poor worried Somali, because KNIFE attacks are so much easier to contain. She literally used the muslim terrorist attack to pimp gun control when the only gun involved is the one used to KILL the terrorist.

I had to cut it off when they started with the "he was worried about being seen praying, maybe he'd be targeted for being a muslim" because, you know, normal people don't like the fact that muslims do shit like plow their car into a crowd and then start stabbing people. 
Right on cue.   

I had this argument with a muslim a few years ago.   

I argue to him,  why is it when there is a terrorist attack, the reaction from the muslim community is never "We are so sorry, there are radicals in our midst, we will work with you to stop them",  but instead it is almost always "we fear backlash".   It is almost instinctual for them to pull out the victim card.   

What makes even more ridiculous,  in this case, is that the perp was actually quoted in a magazine written 3 months as pulling the victim card.   Hes whining about the possibility that people might give him dirty looks if he prays in the open.   

Islam is not the victim.   Its never been the victim.   Its always, always the instigator of the violence.   One of the greatest lies taught in our schools are that the Crusades were an act of aggression by the Catholic nations.   And it seems that big lie just keeps being repeated again and again and again.
Liberals don't think that way. Asshole SJWs and complete lunatics think that way. 
Here's a totally outlandish idea -- how about they stop fucking killing people.
funny, I never saw a headline that said "trump supporters fear backlash after riots." 
I'll take opinions mouthed by verified idiots and liars about the nature of Islam over the Koran and Muslim behavior since the killer pedo cult came out of the desert shall I?

If you love Muslims so much, invite them into your actual house and set them up. Go on. Do it. Lead the way. Show us how it s done.

All Muslims must leave the west. 

Why are we importing liars and perverts? They make perfect Democrat voters.
The same people also say:

Women have it worse in wars since they have to live on and suffer after the men have died.
To be fair they are right in a way.  Muslims are the first Victims of Islam.  They are the ones enslaved by it.  And they can't leave.  The penalty for apostasy is death.  

It's truly a sad thing to behold.
Watch the media narrative in the aftermath of every terror attack. This is ALWAYS one of the stories most of your typical cast of clowns (WaPo, NYT, Slate) put out. 

Logic: Muslims are perpetual victims because their common shared ideology caused one of their fellow believers to commit an act of violence against the kafir. What a joke. 

Still waiting for this "backlash" that never happens. 
Frontlash.  The MSM has these articles prepared in advance.  Search "Muslims fear backlash".  It happens after every attack.  Muslims become the victims.
Radical=devout
I just about died of laughter reading [this article](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/28/attack-with-butcher-knife-and-car-injures-several-at-ohio-state-university.html). 
So then I guess it would be islamophobic not to wipe out all radical islamic terrorism by the root
The terrorists definitely aren't doing their religion's brand any good. 
Isn't showing sympathy toward an enemy group that wants to kill you and demonizing heroes who saved your people treason?
Why aren't the hate crimes minorities/Muslim's/immigrants commit as important to us? Why is it that we're more worried about what white people might do than what already fucking happened...NEWSFLASH: Hate crimes and violence can be perpetuated by any race or religion. Its time to throw the narrative of minorities being perpetual victims in the trash, everyone is capable of violence and hate. If white people unrelated to the slave owners of the 1800's have to answer for slavery, than by that logic should the Somali community have to answer for their crimes? If the answer is no than stop assigning permanent victim status to minorities, its actually pretty racist in and of itself.
[This will happen again. And again, because no one seems to listen. We need to shut down Muslim Student Associations until we figure out what the hell is going on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ffh3i/no_way_to_prevent_this_says_only_nation_where/)

Literal. Sleeper. Agents.

muslims will play the victim card as long as they do not have a big enough base.    
As soon as they are the majority they will slowly whipe out all non muslims.     
They have done this all throughout history.      
But this was not thought in schools so no one believe,s it 
I love how Liberals can consider Muslims 'future victims' of discrimination that hasn't happened yet, but they can't apply the same logic to potential future victims of Islamic terrorism.
>Muslim community fears backlash

EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
This reminds me of that "Comet strikes earth killing millions, woman most affected."
"Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)

...

Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist's real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful."
Remember folks, not all Muslims are terrorist. Only those who listen to Allah and follow his orders in Quran are. 
I'm an Ohio State student. Yesterday I watched leaders of Muslim communities speak in front of a podium. I heard one women say that she and her organization are there for Muslims in the local area after the event PRIOR to saying that she and her group were there for those affected at Ohio State. I mean I honestly want to give Muslims the benefit of the doubt but I'm starting to think that they are very tolerant to radicals and seem to care about Muslims as a whole more than the USA as a whole. I don't want to think this way but I do. 
muslims fear backlash after muslim does islamic things
# STOP^^^^^Stab OPPRESSING^^^^^Stab ME^^^^^Stab 
Being an ex muslim this mentality of liberals drive me nuts. Yes, i grew up surrounded by muslims, went to  mosques regularly. I know how crazy alot of them can be and believe me even the "moderates" will turn into a lunatic if u even question islam. Even my super moderate parents that NEVER prays or visit the mosque, you woulnt even kne theyre muslims, went nuts and threaten to disown me because i "questioned allah"

Its a bad bad religion that must be fought. That is 1 of the reason why i support the god emperor. Eventhough im an atheist now i would rather be a christian or buddhist than a muslim.
As a Trump supporter I have to say this. Muslims are the largest amount being killed by ISIS and terrorists. I can report that as I live in the Middle East. Some people here also should not antagonise Islam as thats not the problem. In Kuwait, we regulate our Mosques, which is why we don't have radicalised groups here. Iraq and Syria were Secular states, which meant they didn't have regulations on their mosques, hence why they brought the rise of radical groups. So Islam isn't really the problem, the problem is that Islam has no central authority, like the Pope for Catholicism. Christian groups have a lot of money to efficiently regulate their mosques and they all have central authorities.

What I am trying to say all in all is that the US should regulate mosques. You must make sure that the Imam is qualified and has no past criminal record, and of course other things.

Also sorry for my shitty English, being a foreigner does that lol.
The only backlash the muslim community should face is a choice:

1) disavow islam

2) be deported to an islamic nation

islam is simply not compatible with western civilization. 
[This year](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/terror-2016.htm)
Holy shit... I have seen this headline (or slight variations) far too much in the last few years.  

I'm triggered. (I'm not) (I am) (Slightly) (Immensely)
I mean, there is some truth to the statement.  Just like no one killed more commies than Stalin, ISIS has probably overwhelmingly killed muslims.   
What I honestly get tired of is the left treating Islam as a race. The reason they do this is it absolves all responsibility of being part of a group that has been killing thousands in the last 15 years. Forget pushing for reforms or leaving you cant change your race. 
Anyone who harps on 'backlash' after a terrorist attack is a traitor to our nation.
I got one for ya " civilized society could give a fuck about fear in the muslim community as we are too busy actually being shot stabbed, runover and blown up by muslims "
In a way they are. But you know how you fix it? Stop importing terrorists and get Muslims involved in solving the problems we already have. 
This makes me SICK.
The media is part of the problem and helps create fears and spreads hate. The real issue is these radicals who come here and bring their ideologies with them. When will enough be enough. When will we stop them from spreading hate & keep them out of our Country. Immigration reform. When will the MSM wake up and actually report real news. Who will stand up and make a change and stop the MSM & the infectious disease that they have become. They spread lies,lies,lies all day everyday. Than we have these brainwashed zombies who stare and fill there minds with the stories they provide. The Hilary's of this country & the Obama's are a threat to society but people don't see that because they have not swallowed the "Red-Pill" or refuse to see the truth, in denial. Sick of it and we no longer have to deal with it or the lies they spread. We have found the one. The one who is not afraid to say fuck you directly to there faces and call them on there bull shit. The God Emperor himself Donald Trump will make not only this county MAGA,but the world. Damn I am proud at this moment that we have him to call out President. üá∫üá∏ The innocent are the victims & it's time to wake up and smell the 2nd Amendment. We have the best President Elect,dont we folks.  
Fucking libs
Muslims have been killing innocent people for thousands of years, the same with most other religions.  But, most of those other religions have since reformed and become more secular, Muslims not so much.  I see no grounds to not hold Muslims responsible for their murderous ways until they do reform.   
Same in Europe. Every. Single. Time.
Rest assured, America will NEVER succumb to shaira law! How about these "poor muslims" come out and actually condemn the radicals? They never seem to do so.. 
This shit is infuriating. Hitchens also had a great statement on this. Their violence is not caused by our resistance to it. To pretend that we are creating the violence by talking about it is a sick capitulating attitude.
If libs are so concerned with Muslims being victims of terror attacks they can take their happy asses to Syria and Iraq and help Muslims defend themselves against violent Muslims.

It's insane that libs are so knee-jerk that they want to blanket cover and allow any refugee into this country.  The majority of MENA is lawless.  You can't do a background check on a person who comes from a village with no birth certificate and no paper trail at all.  You can't even go to the village and get a straight answer about what the local Imam preaches.  You'd have to send in an undercover agent to every little shithole out there to infiltrate the village and sniff around to get an idea what this refugee is all about.  It's untenable.

I know for a fact that the majority of the nation has no fucking clue what life is like outside the developed world.

We definitely need to overhaul, refine, and rework our immigration/refugee processes.  If we can't get a positive picture of what they are about, and they are from a violent culture, sorry, it's not worth the risk to the homeland.  IF they can be checked out, AND they want to BE American, not just live in America, then bring 'em on in!
In much the same way they are concerned of "islamophobia" while for the past 1500 years muslims have performed jihad on the west. Barbary coast slavery was many times worse than US slave trade and in many Islamic countries slavery to this day is still tolerated and practiced. Total death toll of Jihad exceeds 100 million plus the complete decimation of entire ethnicities and cultures in the middle-east and north-Africa. But schools only teach how bad the few retaliatory crusades were.
Uhhhh maybe they should start falling in line then and start acting like civilized people instead of a bunch of cavemen if they are "so scared of backlash."

When the fuck has there been any pure aggression towards their community other than random arson cases or people screaming shit at them. 

Muslims are the epitome of the term snowflake. 
I don't get the thought process these terrorists have.  This guy at OSU said he hated how people thought of refugees/muslims as bad people and were scared of them.  Well no shit Sherlock, when you go around stabbing, running over, and blowing yourself up people are going to be afraid of other refugees and muslims.  That's just how people are wired to think.  Take spiders for example.  People are scared of sharks.  Does that mean all sharks are bad?  No.  Will all sharks kill you?  No.  But you better believe there are some sharks out there that will fuck your shit up.  People tend to generalize their fears.  As always, a few bad apples spoil it for the rest of the bunch. 
liberal logic is my favorite oxymoron.
I've never understood this. I see articles and posts saying "We Muslims are afraid of backlash because of this event. Please stop targeting us, we're not bad". But when has there ever been backlash that is worse than or even remotely equal to the crime? Genuinely curious because I don't see why attention should be brought to them when there's no real threat
If someone in my house is acting up I "deal with them".

They need to deal with their communities.

In 1776 when we were tired of that English bullshit. We DID something about.

Yes yes, let the self-hating flow through you. It'll only make our numbers stronger.
You really should not use the words liberal and logic close together. 
Now now, we all know Muslims are quite fond of killing each other, too. This poor terrorist just didn't have easy access to infidels from his homelands. 
The MSM fake news mafia have a Muslim butthurt template for every terror attack.
The religion of Islam gives, at the very least, a sly nod to its followers to commit such atrocities. There is impetus and motivation behind every Islamic terror attack.
I laughed at the headline because it's been printed so many times, it is almost a parody.
This victimizes america as a whole, regardless of personal faith. Left always painting the divide. Can we just send the refugee back already? We need to control this first.
How are these commies still getting tax dollars?  I swear if conservatives just staged a tax revolt, and we all deducted the percentage from our annual taxes that go to programs like welfare, foodstamps, and all the blatantly liberal institutions the left would just cease to exist.  We're fighting them on eneven ground.  It's an uphill battle for us as we have to raise our money from people voluntarily giving us money they earned in the private sector, while the left gets to fund a whole news station that bellows their talking points 24/7 without commercials by simply dipping into the public treasury.  Plus, they have radical agencies pushing their agenda like the EPA, FDA, IRS and so on   
Well they are in their home countries, but this Liberal logic is saying Muslim Americans are the MAIN victims simply because of bad stigma 
MUSLIM

VICTIM

Hey, it lines up... it kind of rhymes... IT'S A SIGN! (-Liberal)
Funny the left wing media said the same thing in France UK and Germany, the press don't give a fuck about people being hurt physically by a muslim terrorist, ho yeah first don't hurt feeling right.
I know it's not nice to say that, but i hope one day that all the fuckhead who defend islamic terrorist get a taste of the "religion of peace"
This type of shit angers me more than the actual attacks, most of the time.  
It's the same line the media used in Europe. 
To be fair, I fear for my 2A rights after every mass shooting.
They do more than terrorism. Loudest fuckers on the planet. 
Why are they always fearing victimization after a Muslim victimizes others  FYI  Today they are killing civilians in Mosul.  Probably Muslims along with any Christian they can find.

True victim? What does that mean? Anyways the largest religious group suffering from islamic terror and militant attacks are without any doubt muslims.
I wonder how these same people would feel if they or their loved ones were the victims...
Has Cucknada's Justine Trudeau made a statement regarding this incident?
cant we just ban islam lol
I am no protege of Islam. However, that being said does not mean one cannot form basic understanding of the underlying culture and identity of Islam. 

I personally believe that just because you do not act upon the violent nature of your religion does not make you any more morally just. And it does not justify your religion as peaceful. 
They're always fearing the backlash that never happens
I guess they're scared because all Muslims get persecuted for the actions of a few fundamentalist Muslims. It'd be like hating on all baptists because of what those fucks in the westboro baptist church. Doesn't really seem like the right action.
Everything Libtard is just pretzel logic to avoid facts.
"Liberal Logic": Oh, people are in danger? People are threatened? Let's protect the people. We mean all the people. Humans feel threatened by terrorism. Muslims are human. Who would have thought that they're as scared as anyone else? They're scared, you're scared, we're scared, and it's not doing anyone any good to be grouping each other into categories like this. Fuck all, people. 

"Liberal Logic" starts to sound like basic logic. 
Racism has been politicized by both parties, when we stop using racism to fit a narrative we can have a better understanding of what racism really means. What makes racism wrong is the hate and not which skin color is more oppressive or privileged. We need to also understand that many people feel or think racist thoughts for a reason, not that racism in and of itself is ok but that people who feel this way have valid reasons to feel angry. We should address rather than silence them or bash them.
Fuck muslims that attack innocent people and fuck retards that attack people just because they are muslims.
I feel stupid for asking, but is there or has there been violent retaliation towards Muslims after attacks in the US specifically? 

Because if there is the lib media has been missing out on some prime "Islamophobia".
Multiple yearly Islamic terror attacks on US soil against US citizens are completely normal even though they were pretty rare just 2 decades ago. But Muslims really are the true victim here. No need to be racist against the Islamic religion.
Serious question:  How do you take anyone who is seriously religious serious?
women are the primary victims or war etc.
Every time...
Of course. This is known.

Just like how the main victims of war are women.

Why would anyone question these facts? Also, Osama did nothing wrong.
"Stop breaking the laws asshole"
Surprised CNN didn't say "Attacker armed with Butcher Assault Rifle" 
#FAKE NEWS
These headlines are verbatim of the headlines that happened after the Crossroads Mall attack. Interesting also is the attack was very similar: younger Somali immigrant; hit people with a car; used knives; shot dead. 
Fuck the Media.

THEY did this not us. If muslims feel unsafe in America it's because of the media, not because of US citizens. 
I mean, I fear being **literally** slashed, but lulnah, I'm white, doesn't matter, I should take it like I'm supposed to.
When can we finally shut down the MSM for inciting violence? 
2015 averaged 43 homicides per day. Good thing we pay this much attention to all of them. All 15,000+. 
Are we forgetting the hundreds of thousands if not millions of dead, injured, homeless, and starving Muslims in countries war torn by terrorism?
I love (I don't) when they say, "REEEEEEE muslims kill more muslims than they do westerners!"

Like, oh, okay... they even kill each other, and in even greater numbers... bring 'em on in!
While the liberal logic is failing, as always, in a certain way they are correct; the majority of those dead by the acts of Islamic terror are other Muslims.
We should unite in solidarity to support malaria. It is the true victim of all the deaths it causes. 
Yes, of course. Because they're the real victims here. /s
Aren't those dead people usually muslims?
Never understood why people who grow up in such an alien culture come here and want to retain their cultural identity.  Weren't they fleeing from those shitholes?

This is like Californians moving to Colorado and then proceeding to shit all over this beautiful state, turning it into what they were fleeing.
When do we get permission to at least be afraid or even "cautious".
You know what else inspires attacks like these? Twitter allowing radical Muslim groups like ISIS to post on twitter. Meanwhile conservative accounts are banned, but ISIS and pedophilia is A-OK!.
Why dont the muslism community's pull their head out the aand and report suspicious activity instead of hiding it. You do it to yourself and thats the part that hurts the most - some singer
I know! Members of your religion constantly kill people, including hundreds a year in western countries, and suddenly it's like your faith is suspect or something.
DAMN RIGHT TERRORISTS FEAR BACKLASH!

As for the innocent Muslims, don't worry. Liberals are the racist ones, and they're on your side. There won't be backlash for you.
I think that headline means whitelash
i think one of their arguments is how many Muslims were killed by Americans compared to how many Americans were killed by Muslims, which is a point to look at
Wait, where does it say "true victims"? Why isn't there a link to the article?
Well, they do kill each other in their region of the world more than they kill us in the US, since Islam is totally compatible within itself... 
They deserve the backlash. When there are so many "bad apples" coming from your group, your group is bad.
Liberal here and I'd like to say "WTF??!!!  WHAT?! WHO? WHY?" thank you for your time. 
Is there any evidence that he was linked to al Qaeda/ISIS aside from his religion? If this wasn't a religious thing but was instead yet another college "shooting" like VT, why would there be backlash to the local Muslims?

They should police themselves IMO, and be held responsible for violent extremism as a group.
They are doing a good job of culling their numbers. Stinking scum pisslams.

The best way to prevent a backlash is don't fucking attack people in the first place


I made a satirical comment here with this line of reasoning yesterday... it seems I memed irresponsibly. 
Muslims have more deaths than anyone else (they're closer to these groups than the US), so in THAT sense it's right. 

But clearly everyone suffers. 
That's not liberal logic.  stop baiting all these poor internet kids 
That's not liberal logic.  stop baiting all these poor internet kids 
There are many elements to a story. Be it the hero, the villain, the setting, the consequence and IMO there is room for all of them in the media.


The problem is biased and insane news stories who say the killer was victim and make up a brain cancer of a narrative that's insane.
Why would you change from your pure Aabic Muslim lifestyle to that of the dirty kuffar?  Even Muslims know it's the fucking current year.
Cmon guys we also need to remember that mothers are the primary victims of war. 
We should kick those islamic terrorists out of the country so that friendly muslims can stay here and enjoy American freedom.
I would say they should put other Muslims in line but they already have sharia officers and that's a failure of a system. 
What bugs me is they have no issue standing against countrymen to push signaling. 
I think it's insane to say they are the most affected group, however you also have to realize that there are Muslims here in the US who are entirely devoted to peace and just want to live their lives as normal Americans. Maybe the way to stop these attacks is not to blame it on all Muslims(and before you say it, I do think we need stricter refugee laws. In fact, I think they need to stick in their own country or evacuate to somewhere closer but that's a whole different discussion) but instead we should make am effort to be friendlier with them. If we're friends, they'll assimilate faster and we can red pill them.
Well, didn't Hillary herself say that women are the primary victims in war? 
muslims needn't worry.. they can still just go home and beat their wives like normal.
The media always does this. They care more about those doing the killing, than those being killed. The same applies to their attitude toward Castro.
I think when people say this, they generally mean the Muslims in the middle east who deal with the majority of terror attacks. 
Why aren't regular Muslims distancing themselves from this crap? If radical Christians were out murdering people, there would be all kinds of church groups publicly protesting to show opposition.
Well in a sense they are because most of the people slaughtered by Muslim terror attacks are Muslims.  
They should fear a backlash. We ought to drive these fools back across the Atlantic. 

New crusades when?
It's a bit of a leap to go from "Muslims fear backlash" to "liberals think that Muslims are true victims and not killed and injured."

We can talk about the potential backlash and still understand who the "true" victims of the attack are.
That's wrong. But going too far is also wrong. Again, even if the muslims in these communities believe in pedophilia, rape and murder, they are still lawful citizens (assuming) of the US and need to be treated as such.

One of the major foundations of the constitution is the right to practice any religion you want and if we are true americans, we need to respect those rights.

Is someone a satanist in your neighborhood? Do they eat babies and sacrifice to Moloch? No? Do they follow the laws and not interfere with anyone's livelihood in a violent way? Yes? Then leave them alone. 

You don't have to like them or live near them but if they follow the law (no murder, rape, theft, etc) then don't kick them out on the basis of religion alone.

What you guys are doing is dumping the entire bushel of apples even though only around a dozen of them are rotten.
Guessing none of you realize more muslims die to islamic terror than probably all of the western world combined. üôÉ. In reality, they are the "real" victims.

You expect an honest lawyer?  Isn't that why we're draining this god-forsaken swamp, because of all of the professional liars and hypocrits (lawyers and politicians in plain English).

Hello Trump, and the new dawn of real facts and real truths.

Perhaps Kek will make her resign.
Just FWIW, guys, right wing sites like patriotnation and conservative post SAID she said that during her AP interview, but I can't find a single primary source anywhere that shows she actually said that. The big tell is when you look at the interview on the Associated Press itself, she actually dismisses the idea of Trump winning at all.

So the actual interview doesn't have her discussing it, but a bunch of sites quote lengthy and **different** diatribes from that interview that I can't find any indication of that any of these quotes actually exist; so much to everyone's disappointment, this idea that she said she would resign if trump won has **fake news** written all over it.

Stay sharp, pedes, even in debunking stuff that we *wish* was true.
Who cares, she's going to die on March 25th anyway.
Im really appauled that she would do this. Judges should be honest and impartial to their core. How can we have someone this biased on the supreme court? 
Fuck this old bitch man.  She's the fucking devil.  GTFO!!!!


Wouldn't this be counter productive for her? Trump would just replace her with somebody who is the opposite.
OP HERE: I have been informed that RBG did not directly say she would resign if **DONALD J. TRUMP** were elected President. However, she did involve herself in the election, which is a breach of her ethical duties as a Justice of the Court, and as such, she should resign.
She didn't actually say that. She said something like "maybe it's time we move to New Zealand", but the story about her saying she would resign is unsourced.
He's still alive?
I learnt that a judge must keep his or her impartiality towards political affairs. 

She had spoken against Trump. 

She can no longer be impartial when it comes to cases relating to Trump administration.

She should resign.
I wonder if she thought Obama would be able to replace her? Libshits do live in a majestic fantasy world.
democrats put a gun to her head and said ride it out.
Trey Gowdy for Supreme Court and i quote him: "May justice be done though the heavens fall".
**GTFO THEN**
Bye, bitch.
Id guess about the same time trump releases his tax returns.  
Does she even know where she is? Or that she is still a Justice?
Ruth Baader Meinhof.

**OUT ! OUT ! OUT !!!**
This rotten creature has stunk up the Supreme Court since 1993 ( thx Mr? Rapist Bill). Resign you old communist hag! She's 83 but looks 93.
Just another lib who was so sure he'd never win that she felt safe making outrageous declarations
Get rid of Kagan and Sotomayor while you are at it.
Was saying this supposed to change votes?  It probably made more people vote for trump 
Should probobly thank her for all the Trump votes first...then force her off the bench.
Ginsuberg? Can she still stay sharp after cutting through all those laws? 
somewhere there is a Monastery missing its cranky old bat of a Nun
Did Scalia promise to peacefully die in his sleep in TX if Obama was elected?
Supreme court justices shouldnt be commenting on politics in the executive branch anyways. Not only because judges are supposed to be impartial arbiters of the law, but because there is actual legal precdedent that sounds in that principle. One case, for starters, is the first fucking significant case the Supreme Court decided...*Marbury v. Madison*...

EDIT: I realize she didnt say that she would leave the country, but I do remember her partisan comments 
I just feel sorry for this old man. 
GTFO Ruth. Traitor.
Supreme Court Justice should not use their position to influence political campaigns.
So where's the petition at that demands her resignation?
She is going to. A republican congress will be able to indict her for violation of her ethics pledge. She Will see I not coming after the inauguration, and will resign. I'd say mid February.
It was just ART! REEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Pictured: Rachel Maddow 2056
Impeach her.  Easy.  Did you know impeachment was very common during the formative years of our Federal government?
I'll be happy as long as she is outnumbered. Let her decay away.
You said you'd resign. Now be a woman and keep your word!!
#DID YOU JUST ASSUME ALAN GREENSPAN IS A SHE YOU SHITLORD?  REEEEE!
she looks like a bird rofl
You could split wood with that face.
Because it would look bad for the based to call for the resignation of one of the remaining liberal judges. Imagine how the cucks and media would see that? 
This senile Cryptkeeper looking piece of an activist Liberal turd, is proof that there should be an Age Limit for SCOTUS appointees.

Let her resign after Trump is sworn in.
She looks like a grasshopper.
The¬†Constitution of the United States¬†provides that federal judges shall hold their offices during good behavior, which means that they cannot be discharged but can be impeached for misconduct.


SHE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED FOR MISCONDUCT
Has anyone who threatened to quit/leave something if Trump wins actually deliver?
make her resign!
Don't worry, the gelfings are almost extinct and when they go so do the skexies.
http://heavy.com/news/2016/10/watch-supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-calls-trump-a-faker/ for the shills, SJWs and concern trolls. This cunt needs to resign!

‚ÄúHe is a faker,‚Äù the 83-year-old justice told CNN. ‚ÄúHe has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ‚Ä¶ How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.‚Äù

She also criticized Trump in July interviews with the New York Times and the Associated Press.

Ginsburg told the Times, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine what this place would be ‚Äî I can‚Äôt imagine what the country would be ‚Äî with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even want to contemplate that.‚Äù

She also said her late husband, Martin Ginsburg, would have said, ‚Äú‚ÄòNow it‚Äôs time for us to move to New Zealand,‚Äô‚Äù if Trump became president while he was alive.

Ginsburg also told the Associated Press she does not want to envision a Trump presidency.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs,‚Äù Ginsburg said.

**Trump called for her resignation in a tweet.**

‚ÄúJustice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot ‚Äì resign!‚Äù Trump tweeted.

Ginsburg later apologized for her comments, calling them ‚Äúincautious,‚Äù in an interview with NPR.

**‚ÄúI did something I should not have done,‚Äù** she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over and done with and I don‚Äôt want to discuss it anymore.‚Äù

During the debate Wednesday, Trump said Ginsburg made harsh comments about him and his supporters.

**‚ÄúShe was forced to apologize, and apologize she did,‚Äù** Trump said at the debate.
Her and everyone threatening to move if he one should be deported. You don't get to make threats while you throw a temper tantrum and then pussy out when you still lose. Fucking leave you traitors
Typical Liberal - spew lies. Pile of shit with flies.
We want her to resign after Jan 20th. Sure it doesn't look like obama will fill the 9th empty spot before then, but if he's got two empty spots then maybe he'll try harder 
I hate her. And I hate how many women my age revere her. 
It was stupid for her to be impartial during an election and she's Grade A douche because of it, but SCOTUS appointments are lifetime appointments (or until they choose to resign) and I have no patience for folks with an agenda (left or right) demanding SCOTUS resignations. 

TL;DR - honor your Constitution 
She hasn't lost her ability to say "14th Amendment" so she's still good, for her that is.
What a shrew
If we retweet this enough at Kellyanne im sure she can get trump to call her out!
If she doesn't resign, it means her credibility is as good as Miley Cyrus and Rosie O'Donut.
In fairness, she's actually an "anti-abortion of a justice".

I mean, look at this broad. She's at least 900 years old.
Doing what you say you will do requires a spine.  You are expecting entirely too much of even our supreme court justices.
We will replace her with someone much better. For life. 
Give her a few more days. She just donated $17 to Jill Stein. 
Did she really say that? I thought she said something like she 'can't imagine living in a world where Trump is elected'?
Proof that she is a liar
That is the dumbest thing I heard. I hate trump so much that I will let him have another slot on the supreme Court to fill
She was appointed by the rapist, she better resign!
Folks, this is a vote of confidence.  It means she wants Trump to appoint her replacement.

Just go, lady.  We need your seat to Make America Great Again.  
She looks like a goddamn witch.
I forgot all about that.  At the time, I immediately though the old bat had gone senile, since the last thing that would further her interests would be to resign and let Trump get another pick. 

She better get Hillary's medical team lined up to last for 8 years. 
What a punchable face.
She won't last 8 more years. She will be dead and replaced before Trump leaves office. 
Even if I agreeded with the bitch I'd want her to resign. She is so old she litterally can't stay awake during hearings. How can someone preside over the most important court in the world when they can't stay awake for a few hours?
I'm calling bullshit on this. I can't find any source that she said she would resign. This seems like trolling to me.

You are not alone. I'm getting similar things in my college class (I go to pharmacy school, we're together everyday for 4 years practically). Nobody fucks with me, but I'm enemy number one to them. They cannot truly hurt you, truth and real justice is on your side. Continue to be strong, continue to be you. You're almost out of high school, sky is the limit after graduation. Because you'll be in a country where Trump is president til 2024, and his family after that. We are in good hands, and we are with you. 60,000,000 and growing everyday 
It's completely the other way around. The communist left is extremely violent.

I started following Milo on facebook yesterday and today I had a message from a good friend of mine pleading me not to "fall into the trap" and that he's a white supremacist who radicalises young males, and that breitbart is **"literally"** a white supremacist nazi website.

Conservatives believe what they see. Liberals see what they believe. 
There are libtards who cannot accept the truth that 2+2=4 because all other numbers would be offended that they aren't selected as an answer. 
Good, the dems need to get their shit in gear.  I didlike establishment republicans just the same.
Nice one!
Fuck off with the conservative/liberal duopoly. Trump represents neither just as Hillary is nothing of liberalism. Trump represents honest work and the rule of law. Conservatives like boner and Ryan and bush do not. So fuck that label. 

Hillary supporters don't know shit about liberalism. Liberalism is capitalism. Hillarettes are psychopaths, simple.

Do you think a 13 year-old rabid Trump supporter would like it?  My son is all about MAGA.  I raised that boy right!
A fellow centipede talked several months back about having worked at a Trump golf course and having a chance to meet the man.  He asked something like "what is the secret of your success?" and Trump said "I want to do something, everybody fights me on it, I do it anyway, then everybody loves it."  

From years ago!  It was sublime.  

Edit: [found the thread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4fn9b2/i_worked_at_one_of_mr_trumps_golf_courses_for_4/)

Here is the full correct quote: 

>I asked him, "Mr. Trump, how do you succeed so well in everything you do?"

>He said to me, "I'll tell you how it is: I want to do something, everyone fights me about it, I do it anyway, and then everyone loves it."  

Thanks /u/Tomes2789, I love this story and have thought of it many times in the last several months.
I can't wait till my copy arrives tomorrow. Will read it holding it high so that everyone on the train can get triggered. 
Man, I sure hope Trump eventually puts that kind of ideology to work. Maybe he could even run for a public office one day.
HIGH ENERGY CANADIAN CHECKING IN.

I just bought my copy! 

Spez: Have you read his other books? What do you think?

I read it over the summer and I had to stop and take a breath because the book is basically his blueprint for running his campaign. 

"Controversy sells"

"The media love speculation"

"Always play nice with people you want stuff from later"
I've read the book as well. I totally agree. It's like he knew all along that this was going to happen. 
Ohh right in the feelz. 
That picture with all the media "Is this the end of Trump?" headlines comes to mind.
Just finished it as well a couple of weeks. I already knew he was capable of leading this country, but this book is proof. He's had his hands in so many projects with transferable skills now on a YUUUGE scale. Can't get bigger than the USA. The way he deals with the red tape and makes calculated concessions to make great deals is amazing. I can't wait to read "Art of the Comeback" next.
But reddit told me he didn't even write it!
I read this book in 1987. While most of it was over my head at the time, I did recognize the brilliant mind inside the man and I vowed from that point forward, if he EVER ran for office, I'd be right there to support and vote for him.

I have slept SO WELL since November 8th. I have felt relaxed and energized since that night. Soon, my man will be at the helm of this ship!! #MAGA
Page 6: "I don't hold it against people that they have opposed me. I'm just looking to hire the best talent, wherever I can find it."
GREATNESS!
If you want to know what The Donald is, how he thinks, why he is what he is then this is the book for you. I've seen many centipedes talk about him playing 4-D chess, and that's exactly what he does... all the time. Not only will Donald Trump MAGA, but he will lead the world in defending freedom for all men and women. America is truly a blessed nation!

Just bought the book the other day. It's really good!
I had to save this. No need to say more.
He fucking did it!
Great book also available in audio format. Read it long time ago and been listening it on repeat for the past 6 months probably before bed. The thing is amazing and I learn something new every time through!
Awesome. Hadn't read this before.

Have you read "The America We Deserve"?  He wrote it back in 2000

You know...the only muslim girl I know personally comes over to my house to get ready to go out to the club away from her house (lives with family) takes the hijab off and parties and flirts with any white guy who will give her the time of day (until curfew of course). I'm 25, she's maybe 23. I've always wanted to ask her what she would do if her community found out. On several occasions she hid in the bathroom because she thought she had recognized someone.  
She turns around and posts all kinds of religious shit on her insta as if she hadn't just gone out the night before in a body con, push up bra sans headscarf.

Great point of view, Ahmed. Maybe you can bring it down to the White House and tell us more. - Trump
"We need to help the Muslims, they're oppressed! #NotMyPresident"

"No we don't. We don't need your help"


"Wow what a traitor what a fucking white male fuck you fucking racist sexist non-53 gender hating meanie"


You are all delusional if you think Islam is gonna have an Enlightenment any time soon lmfao
Easy for you to say you racist white male racist mysogoracist xenoracist racist priviloracist racist. islamoracist
Wow, never thought about comparing the Radical, 7th century based version of Islam with pre-enlightenment Christians. Makes a lot of sense. If two of the largest institutions in the country, the media and higher education, had a modicum of historical and societal understanding we may be able to unify and begin to tackle this abhorrent ideology once and for all. SAD!
It's all very simple when you think about it. I've been saying this for a long time. "When a person, or group of people openly declare that they WILL NOT abide by the laws and rules of a civilized society, then like a tumor, that person, or group of people MUST be removed from that society." MacWell 2010
Cool post Ahmed! Want to bring it to The_Donald?
Fuck the regressive left
Any religion still using a code of laws from 609AD needs a reform. I'm sad it took so long for the Muslims themselves to catch on and start calling for it. At this point, it may be too little, too late.

dear allah. i am literally shaking from this Islamophobia. I would go to the safe space but it got blown up making cultural enrichment tools. 
The problem with this post is that is suggests that Islam is the motive for terrorism in the Middle East. The fact is, there is no evidence to suggest this. What religion is blamed for Hitler, Stalin, and Pablo Escabar? I guarantee you that if Hitler was Muslim people would have called him a terrorist.
Holy shit this is brilliant. Islam needs it's own [reformation. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation)

So Muslims now get unlimited twitter characters? /s
sorry to be dramatic, but this may be the single most important post on reddit i've seen in a long time
The thing is, regressives do not *want* to help muslims. They want to perpetuate the idea that they are oppressed and the only way to help them is to implement the regressive agenda.

Same for women and other minorities.

Seems like with the Information Age, this will be the pattern and we will see religions mostly go away in 1st world countries within a few short generations.


Once they give up the violent aspects and become peaceful, they have time to really examine what it is their religion actually is, which leads to less and less faith until they become agnostic or atheist. It looks like the natural progression.
That is not a goddamned tweet you moron. It is a fucking Facebook post. Jesus Christ, how stupid must you be to not know the difference.

Trump is trolling. He's hoping some ultraliberals will start burning flags in protest, so the media will have pictures of protesters with burning American flags. It also rallies support with evangelicals.
So many people will get BTFO today, believe me.
Trump gets the reactionary left to cry, then they ~and everyone else listening~ gets hit with the truth about their blatantly hypocritical stances. Top Down justice.

Hillary stuck her head up with this recount crap, now he's publicly shaming her and her followers  about their hypocrisy.  You couldn't more explicitly call out someone and their followers for their hypocrisy.    This is brilliant. 
Trump baits them so often, and yet they keep taking it. 
Listen: I always assumed this "4D chess" stuff was just rationalized chest thumping on the part of this sub, but this move makes me think it's legit.
7D underwater water polo 
Let me crosspost this to /r/Politics and get banned.
He is a master at baiting.   ;) 
This just proves Trump had his Time Machine way back in 2005.
I remember when it was illegal and never thought it should be protected free speech.  I wonder if there is a serious possibility to get that decision overturned.  At any rate, I expect the left to double-down on flag burning during their protests which just makes them seem anti-American to a lot of people.
What's so hilarious here is if Trump uploaded a video of himself burning the American flag, they would yell hate crime.

"It's different if you're running for public office."

So I guess only Hillary can have public and private opinions.


I thought it was a stupid comment at first but the more i think about it the more i like it. Whenever a lib is elected we fear for our gun rights, even though that is clearly protected by the 2A. We worry that God will be pushed out of influential spaces and replaced by empty values and morals, like cups waiting to be filled with the drink of radicals, racists, and those who profit from chaos and strife. We worry about government growth and further decay of the constitution even though it is a limiting document that says the gubmint CAN'T do this this this, all else is up to the states to decide. We worry that a leftist leaning SCOTUS will scuttle the last of the common sense we have left for ourselves. We always worry about federal money for abortions, tax hikes on small businesses etc.

 Its about time we attacked back and made the left feel the pressure i have felt my entire adult life, that everything they believe in must be sacrificed on the altar of politics and progress. Let them know what it feels like to feel like they are the last sane person left alive on a planet full of crazy assholes who want nothing more than to destroy, to tear down, to rebel against everything traditional, everything normal.

 So fuck them and their ideology, lets have a fire sale on everything the left holds dear and show them that this election wasnt just another election that it was America blowing off layers of dust and everything that has fallen to disrepair in our union will be made whole again, that America will be great again! Lets show them that this was an election for the quiet simple forgotten person who has been attacked and vilified and disrespected for only wanting to carve out a little space for themselves and their families and their traditions. 

 GODDAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO WIN AGAIN!!!!

These are continually assessed by three assessors before they are offered to The Don for judgment yea or nay. 

We are at drift net trolling proportions now.

They have to stop taking everything he says literally. 

They fall for the bait everytime. 
So when they asked Hillary what she had accomplished as a Senator, this bill couldn't be included because it didn't pass.

She also voted against the same bill as an amendment, which fell three votes short of passing in the senate.  So what does she really believe here anyways?
Why would anyone think people would get properly triggered about burning the confederate flag?

And there it is. [4D chess in action.](https://i.sli.mg/rtHgvP.gif) 
They don't care. Anything to oppose Trump.
Liberals are such idiots. Yeah burning the flag is freedom of speech but that flag also represents the sacrifice of our armed forces. If you have been given a folded flag then you wouldn't be out there burning it in some stupid protest paid for by Soros. I know how it feels to watch them fold and hand that flag over in honor of service. So fuck you to everyone who thinks burning our flag is cool. My heart broke accepting our flag and it's not a feeling I'll ever forget.
[deleted]
We are allowed to disagree on this sub, right?:

I believe flag-burning should be allowed, as it is an expression of free speech. I do not support burning the american flag, I only support the **right** to burn the american (and every other) flag.
That's our God Emperor!
So glad you posted this. I was so confused. Now it makes sense! 51D Transdimensional Tic Tac Toe in action!
The mad man knew it. Baited again.
What if you thought it was stupid either way? 
I would oppose it no matter who said it. It's the suppression of free speech. It says that the flag is sacred and that disrespecting the country by burning a flag is an awful thing and says that America can't take criticism of what it stands for. Any country that cannot take criticism is not able to be free.  

It bothers me especially that Donald Trump says this because I feel his rise is partly on the backs of those that were suppressed themselves. To abandon that and start encouraging the restriction of burning flags is a bit of a slap in the face.
Ahahahhaha God emperor shitposter-elect playing 6D eels and escalators. He straight up word for word proposed exactly what Hillary proposed. Now when people get mad and burn flags in protest....he can point out how it was Hillary's idea
The punishments for burning a flag is a bit different but it is a violation of our first amendment right in both occasions. 
I don't support this.

I also don't support Hillary Clinton.
This is the chance for pedes to show their integrity.

It's already illegal to burn a flag.. that you don't own. If you're buying flags and burning them then you're just helping out some patriotic company that makes flags.

As a veteran I think it's pretty dangerous to be implying there should be a law against free speech. It's also impractical, the supremes would certainly overturn it in like 5 min and he needs to be doing other things, like deporting 'undocumented' immigrants who voted, and are now *by definition* felons and **illegal immigrants** any way you want to slice it.

But, I find it very troublesome Trump said this, and people on the right need to have more integrity than people on the left who support everything their guy does because he's their guy.

I hope he just meant there should be consequences like "people should boycott them or ostracize them", not like "they need to be arrested".

If he meant the latter, as a veteran who swore to protect the Constitution, I don't appreciate a president who is undermining it. I never appreciated it with Obama, and I hope Trump isn't heading down that path before he's even in office.

There are 10 Amendments and they are all important. If you buy a box of guns or a box of flags, that's your right. If you burn either, that's also your right.

If you burn flags in public, you're a douche, but it's your right to be a douche.
Such a shame that she couldn't get shit done!

Feels good to keep proving them wrong. ;)
Yeah but that was just her public position not her private position... and she's probably changed her views by now anyways /s (sadly not /s).
Trump reminds me of that quote about the American militaries. How the Japanese an Germans can't predict what the Americans will do because they themselves don't know, and this makes America a difficult enemy. American then comes out to say, yea we don't really know what we're doing. The implication being that keeping up the guise of being an idiot, even though damaging to the reputation, is a great strategy. Trump allows himself to be ridicules, knows his reputation can sustain it, and accomplishes what no polical pawn can predict
I had a team of scientists look into the mindset of liberals. We had 1000 case study volunteers. They came to the conclusion there brains have been hacked by the "MSM" & unfortunately due to them being badly damaged it makes liberals incredibly stupid. Next we will be comparing Libs to monkeys to see who is smarter. Will keep you updated on the results.

Fuck off with the conservative/liberal duopoly. Trump represents neither just as Hillary is nothing of liberalism. Trump represents honest work and the rule of law. Conservatives like boner and Ryan and bush do not. So fuck that label.

We have tons of anecdotal evidence of illegals voting! 

In addition, we have one survey that has the following information:

#15% of illegals have admitted to registering to vote

And that's just the ones that confessed. It's likely much more!
A liberal yesterday said to me "How could illegals vote? They aren't citizens!"
Let's not forget that Obama essentially said it was ok for illegals to vote.

We need a constitutional amendment for strong voter I.D. laws. While I believe in states rights for a great number of issues, this should be a federal mandate as to prevent illegals across the board from having the vote.
Wow, double whammy. Multiple layers of triggering. 

spez: I read about the voting procedure in America my jaw dropped. I'm only one year older than my country's democracy and even we have better voter regulaton.
No because that would be illegal, and illegal immigrants are a group of people that would never break a law in order to help and serve themselves.  

Seriously, think about it you racist! Why would you think an illegal alien would be the type of person to commit an illegal act that is very easy to get away with, just to advance themselves and their families further?

THANK YOU!

Why don't we push this more?

If I understand it correctly - and I'm just a dumb german fuck - all you need in - for example California is a DRIVERS LICENSE to vote! And illegals can get those easily.

If that is true - Why should they not vote? I bet dems even HELP them to.
And not just illegals.  I wonder how many green card holders, H1-B card holders, "refugee status" people and assorted others also vote?

There has to be a state-by-state review.  Followed by a mandatory cross-referencing of states so people who go to college in one state and maintain their "home" in another are either blocked from double voting (absentee) or on notice that if they do so there is a REAL risk of being stuck with a criminal record.

Also, only CITIZENS should count for apportionment on the next census.
We have the quickest stickies!
I got made during the election that the MSM kept harping about how trump was going to lose because he would lose the Latino vote (illegal immigrant vote) because his stance on border patrol. IF the illegals become a voting bloc that isnt something to be celebrated that is a problem that needs fixing. In my mind there shouldn't even be  a Vote Aqui.
considering I never see anyone at polling places ask for proof of voter eligibility other than if your xeroxed signature is in the sign in roll from last time. No ID check to make sure it actually IS you, nothing to check if your voting privilege got taken away due to felony conviction, no check of citizenship...I'd say odds are 99.9999999999999999% there were massive amounts of illegals voting.
>There's no evidence of voter fraud!

No shit asshole, because no one even tries to track it.  I left a bowl of candy on my porch on halloween with a sign that said "take one."  When I got home, the bowl was empty.

Sure, there's no actual evidence that anyone took more than one, because I did absolutely nothing to keep track of how many people came, and made no effort to monitor the bowl.  The left's logic is ridiculous.
to vote in my riding in Vancouver, BC, Canada for our last federal election -- my name was already on the registered voters' list (I had voted previously).  At the DESIGNATED polling place (they had my name on a list there), I had to show personal ID (passport) AND a piece of mail (bill for hydro/cable or credit card company, something "official" like that) addressed to me with the same address on it as the one for which I was registered.  All the major parties had individuals at the polling place FOR SCRUTINY purposes.  All ballots are paper, and they are hand counted.  

Our election results are normally meaningfully tabulated and "called" within 3-4 hours of the west coast polls closing.  Any close races are automatically recounted, again by hand, and again with any representatives of political parties who want to observe.

Quite frankly, what you guys do in the United States -- shocking to me!!!  No one complains about the voting system in Canada, not any of the parties (we have minimal gerrymandering, although it does happen, and any vote redistribution is always done with trying to not "offend Quebec").  Simply put, in Canada, you have to win the hearts and minds of the voters, and you have to get your vote out and to the polling places on voting day (and we do have advanced polls as well, run as the same tight ship).
Let's see how Steins initiative goes then. If there is widespread voter fraud, we need to find it and stamp it out.

Keep in mind that Trump didn't tweet that illegals voted.  He said that there were illegal votes.  That could be illegals, but it could also be citizens committing vote fraud.
Well NYT did a study and its not statistically proven. So Carlos Slim said voter fraud doesn't exist. Obama doubled down on it. I am sure it was verified by the top scientists at fuckmywife university. 
I have no data but I really believe that the chance that millions of illegals voted is higher than the chance Russian hackers infiltrated the machines...

might i add that those machines are owned by George Soros who is a well known financial backer of the Clintons and a known enemy of democracy 

I'd also like to say that it's total propaganda that Russia has been involved in our recent news cycle. Shit has no basis and is all made up to divert attention from what's in those wikileaks (PODESTAAA WE HAVE YOUR EMAILS!)
We saw lots of instances where Democrats bussed citizens around polling areas to vote multiple times.  We saw many people bragging on Facebook and Twatter that they voted multiple times.  It's not too hard to figure that illegals would also have voted especially in areas where they were mixed in with citizens in high numbers.  We also saw Obummer telling them in a speech that they would not be in trouble if they voted.  The DNC made a big play for the Hispanic vote to keep Trump from being elected. 

For those liberals that don't see anything wrong with non citizens voting then consider that every one of their votes has the potential of cancelling out a citizen's vote and that is WRONG.  We don't go to their country and vote illegally.  They should not be able to vote in ours.  Not one vote until you are a citizen.

They have the gall to say "but they haven't been caught so there is no evidence." How delusional do you have to be to think no one took advantage of the fact that California will give anyone a license and then automatically register them to vote. 
The MSM hides this information just as they did the O'keefe videos.

There are sure a lot fewer barriers to vote for illegal immigrants than there are for Russians to access voting machines not connected to the Internet.

Yet MSM is bending over backwards telling us they are sure Putin send his agents from Russia to hack our machines (which are not connected to the internet), while hand waving allegations of illegal immigrants voting.
Pretty clear that illegals voted.  

For illegals, this election was polarized to basically this: 

**If Candidate A:**  WALL + DEPORT + NO SENDING MONEY "HOME"

**If Candidate B:**  AMNESTY + CITIZENSHIP + DREAM ON!

They voted... and a thorough evaluation of voter rolls would prove it.
It's probably an issue of them believing/feeling that the votes are valid.
Thieves break into your house but it's absurd to say that they then steal things once they're inside!
But npr told me these were false claims and they got some nerdy guy to tell me why I should believe in the sanctity of voting machines made by private companies that could have compromised code.

Machines make the process inherently vulnerable, not safer. NPR is straight up propaganda at this point. What the fuck happened? 
but I thought they were too busy keeping the entire American economy afloat with their cheap labor?!?!?!
Dont get separated in the process of our goverment deatroying this earth and everything in it. 
Provisional ballots? Yes they can vote but it's not counted as they can't be confirmed eligible. 
Wouldn't it be simpler to have voter registration tied to your drivers license or government issued ID? It expires when your DL expires or Gov ID. You have to renew that ID anyway so why not just register everyone to vote with a valid ID? When the election rolls around you just print off the names / address' of people who live in the area and boom, voter registration rolls.

Why do we have a whole seperate dept for voter registration? The DMV should do it. It should be the same system. You want to vote? Go get a Government ID. (usually a dr license) Passports are handled on the federal level I believe so I don't think they'd be a good ID to connect voter registration too but most people go to a dmv office in the county they live in so it should be an easy thing to handle for the DMV.
The media were openly engaging in a bit of semantical fuckery trying to say that only "illegal aliens" couldn't legally vote.

Which is the same as suggesting that green card holders can legally vote.

Green card holders absolutely positively cannot legally vote!  ...Yet they are illegally voting. And the current criminal in chief was on TV encouraging it!
Still, it seems like a question of risk-reward issue.

Illegaly voting might end up getting you deported. And the direct benefit of voting is pretty much zero, especially when Trump wins anyway. 



The media is colluding with election fraud.
This guy is so fucking based he probably leaks radiation

Wat? One of the tougher western countries to get a green card to lol what's he talking about.

Love how the media says over and over again, "NO PROOF" but then doesn't admit they've never actually taken time to look over all the proof that is out there. In their minds, if they don't report it, it never happened.
Bill is on it.
Am Californian, hear me out-

It's not all the rest of the state... it's not many of the 'normal' suburbs... it's not San Francisco, it's not the outskirts... it's the shitholes like East L.A. etc... where I have no doubt some illegal voting does occur.  In areas where the population is 100% latino that I doubt the integrity of their ability to turn away illegals from voting.

When EVERY SINGLE PERSON involved in the entire local voting process is PRO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT, there's nothing stopping them from assuring they can vote.  When every person in the room supports it, there's nothing to stop it.  Cities like Huntington Park where they have illegal immigrants as appointed city officials is where this happens... everyone there even the lawmakers want illegals to partake in government... and no one there is against it.
Wasn't it estimated that over 3 million illegal immigrants voted in the US general election this year? Funny, considering Hillary's "winning margin". I wonder how many of them voted for President-elect Trump....
They've just been spinning it trying to connect it to PV claims saying that they were "illegally voting" instead of "illegals voting."

Little nuanced but that's what they're trying to do to delegitimize the claim.

Do I think over 2 million voted?  Not sure, but it's not as impossible as the left and MSM is trying to paint it as.  I'm all for maximum turnout, but the laws in states like California are too lax in the wrong places.

Spez:  I fucking *love* our MODS for making Edit into Spez, I just noticed this.
No, they just apply common sense and figure that the odds of 3 million illegals (that would be about 1/3 of all illegal immigrants) overwhelmingly casting invalid votes for one side seems pretty far fetched.  Repeated studies about vote fraud find very little of it occurs, so the onus is on the accusers to find the 3 million invalid votes.
I am against this ALL CAPS movement #noallcaps
Lol people here are so radicalized.  Well at least y'all aren't outside hitting ppl with cars and knifing them
I don't get why the media must defend this notion. Isn't it their job to ask questions and be exploratory/curious; not to defend the voting system. That's not their job!
Millions of illegals vote. It's so bad that some states have rewritten their boards of elections to make it nearly impossible to challenge their votes, by forcing only people in the district to have the capability to challenge ballots, and by rewriting laws so you can only challenge single ballots, not groups of ballots.
I have a question: how is it possible for undocumented immigrants to vote and skew election results? When I voted at my local voting place, they asked me my name and checked that I was on the roster for voters of that area. I signed a piece of paper that confirmed my name and address, and the volunteers crossed my name off of the roster (I presume to signify that I had voted). Losing my ability to vote because an undocumented immigrant has fraudulently voted as me would take away my ability to vote but not inflate the number of votes for a candidate. 

Thanks. 

- I live in NC 

Serious question, trying to understand this. 
That's exactly why Jill Stein will never recount CA votes...she knows that an illegal would never break the law. And she says that the recount isn't being done to benefit anyone. That's why she's going for the states that really meant something to Hillary but Trump thumped her in. DO THE TRUMP THUMP! THUMPIN' TRUMP!
When we create voter ID laws, there needs to be some sort of consequence for those who are illegal.  Ims should deport them and every one of their family members status should be verified.  That should keep the illegals from voting.

Here is the email I just sent them.

Dear Sir/Madam

I am very concerned that you are pulling advertising from a news website because it has a perceived conservative bias. 
Conservativism, patriotism and having right wing opinions does not automatically equal hate speech, racism or whatever obia or ism that you want to use that day.
Until you apologise for generalising right wing opinion as hate speech I will no longer be purchasing any of your products and neither will my wife or children.

I think it is probably worth mentioning that I'm British, live in the UK and that your tales of bigotry spread over the ocean. 
Across the planet, those that have not been indoctrinated into the quasi religion that is political correctness will not take kindly to your slander and cultural Marxism. 

Regards 
Anyone else miss Flutie Flakes?
They're only hurting themselves.
It's candy for breakfast.  Bad news!
Every time I see one of these companies make a decision like this it saddens me because I never bought their product in the first place.
Two things:

* From Wikipedia: **The company's brands include Froot Loops, Apple Jacks, Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Special K, Cocoa Krispies, Keebler, Pringles, Pop-Tarts, Kashi, Cheez-It, Eggo, Nutri-Grain, Morningstar Farms, and many more. Kellogg's stated purpose is "Nourishing families so they can flourish and thrive."** Looks like we have more to boycott. 
* [Harvey Kellogg was a weird guy](http://m.mentalfloss.com/article.php?id=27016)
FU Kellogg and your shitty cereals . Easy boycott, I already was.
Store brands ftw
Cereals are a waste of money anyways. They're just a bunch of refined grains with sugar added and sprayed with vitamins so they can pretend to be healthy. They're one of the biggest food scams around and everyone is better off not eating them.

Kellog served Corn Flakes at his sanitarium as part of his bland, vegetarian diet, thinking that such a diet would promote celibacy. As they say, the rest is history.
I buy unsweetened cereals and put artificial sweetener on it anyways. Sugar/corn syrup are calories for suckers.
Dont eat that shit. Even if they supported Trump.
American oats and honey!

I buy the Millville brand sold at Aldi which are oddly enough also called Frosted Flakes.  They are as good if not better than the original as are most of the Millville knockoffs.  But yes, I'm all up for eggs and bacon.  But it has to be American bacon because Canadian bacon, a.k.a. ham in the USA, doesn't cut it.
Who buys brand name cereal anyways?  The same stuff is in the box next to it marked with generic store brands.  And of course, if you have a house full of kids,  those 10 pound bags on the bottom shelf are the only way to go.
Raisin Bran is for pussies anyway
Yes,  fk Kellogg's 
General Mills is not on a shitlist yet, right? RIGHT?! Cause I need my Cheerios.
Sugar delivery system - 10% - avoid if at all possible    
Kellogg sales are down bigly in the UK anyway, people are moving away from cereals.
Everybody turn off ad block for breitbart
Frosted Snowflakes?
I'd boycott it but I don't eat garbage 
Bad move for a cereal company to alienate consumers. Millennials are barely eating cereal at all. No shit, it's not even fit for cattle or horses.
Yes time to eat healthy. Kellog's products are filled with crap.
More shitty products I haven't bought in decades. But it still pisses me off how messed up the "hate speech" definition is changing. The propaganda has been insane these past 3 years. 
We don't have any Kellogg cereal, and we sure as heck won't have any in the future. 
To be fair I stopped a lot of Kellogg's a long time ago. Most of their food tastes like cardboard. 
Oh no goodbye Tony the Tiger. 
Fuck them. I like the Publix brand better anyway.
no more Kellogg for me. 
Remember, these were the cucks who dropped Michael Phelps after a picture of him with a bong surfaced. They've long hated America, so don't eat the trash food the manufacture.
Real men eat Bacon & Eggs for breakfast anyways. Cereal is for kids or man-children. 
Eh, who needs them?  I'm on a low carb diet anyway.  
I like General Mills' cereals more anyways...
I buy the stuff in the bag anyway, pretty sure it has a new name every time I get it.
Way ahead on this one since I  wasn't too keen on Urine being an ingredient. 
It's better to go for actual cereal anyway, like oatmeal, farina, grits, cracked wheat berries, etc instead of this extruded snack-food crap.
"Civilized community fears backlash from savage Muslims" is irrelevant I guess
Everything wrong with the mainstream media is right in this article title. Who cares about the victims or the hero that prevented a greater tragedy- let's focus on the attacker, because identity politics dictates proving Muslims aren't Islamic terrorists....seriously, that's messed up.
I know this whole post is funny but the funniest thing about OPs submission is 

>liberal logic

HAHAHA
If obama had a son would he have looked like the OSU attacker too?
The Radical Muslim cries out in pain as he stabs you in the throat..
They fear backlash?  Well I fear getting Allahu Ackbarred!
Won't anyone think of those poor terrorists?
If only they could go somewhere where Islam is the primary religion and there is no general, daily violence toward anyone -- including and especially Muslims. It doesn't exist because in the presence of Islam there is no peace.

There are good people that are Muslims, but that doesn't mean Islam is not the problem. I get that people are people and will be violent despite religion or association, but there is no other religion that transforms cities into warzones or unleashes daily terror on unsuspecting innocents or completely invades and commands one's way of life with total loss of personal freedom and choice. Ask gays, women, atheists, or people of other religions who have fled Muslim countries about their quality of life. Now see if you can find a single example of any one person who has fled from *anywhere in the world* to a Muslim region in order to find freedom from religious tyranny.
That is the headline we have seen after EVERY terror attack.

Even though a backlash has NEVER happened, even after 911.
I remember when I heard about the Brussels attacks early this year. That was around the time Trump was getting flak from the press for suggesting we should ban foreign Muslims temporarily. And then I remember seeing that before those terror attacks Trump had made a remark not long before that Brussels was a hellhole. All of that didn't quite redpill me yet but that was when I first thought "yeah, this guy is gonna be president".
#FUCK RADICAL ISLAM AND FUCK WHOEVER DEFENDS IT  
"The white community fears backlash as the KKK burns down a black church and paints Trump on it"

Although we all know a liberal probably did that, this is the same "logic"
Underlying message:

Muslim attacks are justified and to be expected

You are really the root cause

When they occur you are not to assume it's islamic

Not to say islamic terrorism or radical jihad, etc.

You are not to surveil their mosques or retaliate against the attacks in any way

To do so is to invite more slaughter and recruit more terrorists

Just shut up and take it, infidels.
Liberals don't have logic
I've from the UK and I've been waiting for this so-called backlash for years. After the summer of terror there was nothing.

Muslims kill people and yet we are supposed to feel guilty? Fuck off
Maybe they should fear backlash. I'm russian, if Russians started creating terror in America I wouldn't be surprised if there was backlash, it's called common sense. I would also do what I can to talk some common sense into other russian to quit oh I dunno, killing everyone?!
I'm ashamed to ever call my self a liberal. 
They should. Fuck Mohammedites. Anyone who follows the word of Mohammed  is, by definition, an potental tettorist. The muslim books are instruction guides, not a collection of stories, like the bible.
Muslims are the true victims of Islamic terror in the same way that dog owners are the true victims of dog attacks.  Living in proximity to the danger just increases the risk.  But if we all brought a dog into our homes, then there'd be just as many (or more, in all likelihood) non-Muslim victims.
2 minute sticky?

#MODS = DOGS!

^This ^comment ^has ^been ^edited ^by ^u/spez
I think we are going to see more of these type of notes. They are getting smarter they realize pure terror will makenus stronger. Now they are going to do their evil killings in the name of US oppression. It sounds like lunacy because the level of hypocracy but the liberals will eat that shit up w a spoon like we are seeing now. 
It's true that one of the motives of the terrorists is to isolate Muslims and prevent them from assimilating.
This is literally all they are worried about. Fuck the people who got cut up and ran over right? We have to worry about the backlash towards muslims! I mean what the fuck man.
If the Muslim community knew true fear, such incidents would not have occurred. They would either rein in their own jihadi tendencies, or rein in on the people around them.

Just liberals twisting the narrative and portraying Muslims as poor victims, due to 'oppression'. Lefties love this big 'O' word.
they should fear backlash. not violent backlash but social backlash. they need to self police. these assholes make the whole religion look like shit. 

if a group of my friends and I go out should they not be held accountable if I am picking fights with everyone we come across? They need to either control me or kick me out of the group. 
Liberal logic is what I'm going to be saying a lot today. 
If only they had more prayer rooms
Maybe the Muslim community in this country should be a little more vocal in condemning this kind of crap.
It's arrogant as hell to declare Muslim communities the only victims of terror attacks, but I do think there are at least a few decent, actual moderate Muslims out there who are rightly afraid of backlash. It's like when dark-skinned Indians and Sikhs were victims of hate crimes after 9/11 by retards who didn't know any better.

Not that the media cares about showing both sides of the story.
The ctl-left are ignorant assholes. Anything to distract from the actual problem and prop up the narrative. 
There hasn't been serious backlash since after 9/11, when Muslims killed 3000 Americans. Even then Sikhs took most of the punishment. I'm sure you'll be fine. 
It would make a lot of sense to people who think women have always been the primary victims of war. 
CNN ("POSSIBLE TERRORISM is the motive") just had a blonde wobbleheaded "terrorism expert" on who effusively praised the fact that no GUN was available to the poor worried Somali, because KNIFE attacks are so much easier to contain. She literally used the muslim terrorist attack to pimp gun control when the only gun involved is the one used to KILL the terrorist.

I had to cut it off when they started with the "he was worried about being seen praying, maybe he'd be targeted for being a muslim" because, you know, normal people don't like the fact that muslims do shit like plow their car into a crowd and then start stabbing people. 
Right on cue.   

I had this argument with a muslim a few years ago.   

I argue to him,  why is it when there is a terrorist attack, the reaction from the muslim community is never "We are so sorry, there are radicals in our midst, we will work with you to stop them",  but instead it is almost always "we fear backlash".   It is almost instinctual for them to pull out the victim card.   

What makes even more ridiculous,  in this case, is that the perp was actually quoted in a magazine written 3 months as pulling the victim card.   Hes whining about the possibility that people might give him dirty looks if he prays in the open.   

Islam is not the victim.   Its never been the victim.   Its always, always the instigator of the violence.   One of the greatest lies taught in our schools are that the Crusades were an act of aggression by the Catholic nations.   And it seems that big lie just keeps being repeated again and again and again.
Liberals don't think that way. Asshole SJWs and complete lunatics think that way. 
Here's a totally outlandish idea -- how about they stop fucking killing people.
funny, I never saw a headline that said "trump supporters fear backlash after riots." 
I'll take opinions mouthed by verified idiots and liars about the nature of Islam over the Koran and Muslim behavior since the killer pedo cult came out of the desert shall I?

If you love Muslims so much, invite them into your actual house and set them up. Go on. Do it. Lead the way. Show us how it s done.

All Muslims must leave the west. 

Why are we importing liars and perverts? They make perfect Democrat voters.
The same people also say:

Women have it worse in wars since they have to live on and suffer after the men have died.
To be fair they are right in a way.  Muslims are the first Victims of Islam.  They are the ones enslaved by it.  And they can't leave.  The penalty for apostasy is death.  

It's truly a sad thing to behold.
Watch the media narrative in the aftermath of every terror attack. This is ALWAYS one of the stories most of your typical cast of clowns (WaPo, NYT, Slate) put out. 

Logic: Muslims are perpetual victims because their common shared ideology caused one of their fellow believers to commit an act of violence against the kafir. What a joke. 

Still waiting for this "backlash" that never happens. 
Frontlash.  The MSM has these articles prepared in advance.  Search "Muslims fear backlash".  It happens after every attack.  Muslims become the victims.
Radical=devout
I just about died of laughter reading [this article](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/28/attack-with-butcher-knife-and-car-injures-several-at-ohio-state-university.html). 
So then I guess it would be islamophobic not to wipe out all radical islamic terrorism by the root
The terrorists definitely aren't doing their religion's brand any good. 
Isn't showing sympathy toward an enemy group that wants to kill you and demonizing heroes who saved your people treason?
Why aren't the hate crimes minorities/Muslim's/immigrants commit as important to us? Why is it that we're more worried about what white people might do than what already fucking happened...NEWSFLASH: Hate crimes and violence can be perpetuated by any race or religion. Its time to throw the narrative of minorities being perpetual victims in the trash, everyone is capable of violence and hate. If white people unrelated to the slave owners of the 1800's have to answer for slavery, than by that logic should the Somali community have to answer for their crimes? If the answer is no than stop assigning permanent victim status to minorities, its actually pretty racist in and of itself.
[This will happen again. And again, because no one seems to listen. We need to shut down Muslim Student Associations until we figure out what the hell is going on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ffh3i/no_way_to_prevent_this_says_only_nation_where/)

Literal. Sleeper. Agents.

muslims will play the victim card as long as they do not have a big enough base.    
As soon as they are the majority they will slowly whipe out all non muslims.     
They have done this all throughout history.      
But this was not thought in schools so no one believe,s it 
I love how Liberals can consider Muslims 'future victims' of discrimination that hasn't happened yet, but they can't apply the same logic to potential future victims of Islamic terrorism.
>Muslim community fears backlash

EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
This reminds me of that "Comet strikes earth killing millions, woman most affected."
"Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology.)

...

Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist's real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful."
Remember folks, not all Muslims are terrorist. Only those who listen to Allah and follow his orders in Quran are. 
I'm an Ohio State student. Yesterday I watched leaders of Muslim communities speak in front of a podium. I heard one women say that she and her organization are there for Muslims in the local area after the event PRIOR to saying that she and her group were there for those affected at Ohio State. I mean I honestly want to give Muslims the benefit of the doubt but I'm starting to think that they are very tolerant to radicals and seem to care about Muslims as a whole more than the USA as a whole. I don't want to think this way but I do. 
muslims fear backlash after muslim does islamic things
# STOP^^^^^Stab OPPRESSING^^^^^Stab ME^^^^^Stab 
Being an ex muslim this mentality of liberals drive me nuts. Yes, i grew up surrounded by muslims, went to  mosques regularly. I know how crazy alot of them can be and believe me even the "moderates" will turn into a lunatic if u even question islam. Even my super moderate parents that NEVER prays or visit the mosque, you woulnt even kne theyre muslims, went nuts and threaten to disown me because i "questioned allah"

Its a bad bad religion that must be fought. That is 1 of the reason why i support the god emperor. Eventhough im an atheist now i would rather be a christian or buddhist than a muslim.
As a Trump supporter I have to say this. Muslims are the largest amount being killed by ISIS and terrorists. I can report that as I live in the Middle East. Some people here also should not antagonise Islam as thats not the problem. In Kuwait, we regulate our Mosques, which is why we don't have radicalised groups here. Iraq and Syria were Secular states, which meant they didn't have regulations on their mosques, hence why they brought the rise of radical groups. So Islam isn't really the problem, the problem is that Islam has no central authority, like the Pope for Catholicism. Christian groups have a lot of money to efficiently regulate their mosques and they all have central authorities.

What I am trying to say all in all is that the US should regulate mosques. You must make sure that the Imam is qualified and has no past criminal record, and of course other things.

Also sorry for my shitty English, being a foreigner does that lol.
The only backlash the muslim community should face is a choice:

1) disavow islam

2) be deported to an islamic nation

islam is simply not compatible with western civilization. 
[This year](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/terror-2016.htm)
Holy shit... I have seen this headline (or slight variations) far too much in the last few years.  

I'm triggered. (I'm not) (I am) (Slightly) (Immensely)
I mean, there is some truth to the statement.  Just like no one killed more commies than Stalin, ISIS has probably overwhelmingly killed muslims.   
What I honestly get tired of is the left treating Islam as a race. The reason they do this is it absolves all responsibility of being part of a group that has been killing thousands in the last 15 years. Forget pushing for reforms or leaving you cant change your race. 
Anyone who harps on 'backlash' after a terrorist attack is a traitor to our nation.
I got one for ya " civilized society could give a fuck about fear in the muslim community as we are too busy actually being shot stabbed, runover and blown up by muslims "
In a way they are. But you know how you fix it? Stop importing terrorists and get Muslims involved in solving the problems we already have. 
This makes me SICK.
The media is part of the problem and helps create fears and spreads hate. The real issue is these radicals who come here and bring their ideologies with them. When will enough be enough. When will we stop them from spreading hate & keep them out of our Country. Immigration reform. When will the MSM wake up and actually report real news. Who will stand up and make a change and stop the MSM & the infectious disease that they have become. They spread lies,lies,lies all day everyday. Than we have these brainwashed zombies who stare and fill there minds with the stories they provide. The Hilary's of this country & the Obama's are a threat to society but people don't see that because they have not swallowed the "Red-Pill" or refuse to see the truth, in denial. Sick of it and we no longer have to deal with it or the lies they spread. We have found the one. The one who is not afraid to say fuck you directly to there faces and call them on there bull shit. The God Emperor himself Donald Trump will make not only this county MAGA,but the world. Damn I am proud at this moment that we have him to call out President. üá∫üá∏ The innocent are the victims & it's time to wake up and smell the 2nd Amendment. We have the best President Elect,dont we folks.  
Fucking libs
Muslims have been killing innocent people for thousands of years, the same with most other religions.  But, most of those other religions have since reformed and become more secular, Muslims not so much.  I see no grounds to not hold Muslims responsible for their murderous ways until they do reform.   
Same in Europe. Every. Single. Time.
Rest assured, America will NEVER succumb to shaira law! How about these "poor muslims" come out and actually condemn the radicals? They never seem to do so.. 
This shit is infuriating. Hitchens also had a great statement on this. Their violence is not caused by our resistance to it. To pretend that we are creating the violence by talking about it is a sick capitulating attitude.
If libs are so concerned with Muslims being victims of terror attacks they can take their happy asses to Syria and Iraq and help Muslims defend themselves against violent Muslims.

It's insane that libs are so knee-jerk that they want to blanket cover and allow any refugee into this country.  The majority of MENA is lawless.  You can't do a background check on a person who comes from a village with no birth certificate and no paper trail at all.  You can't even go to the village and get a straight answer about what the local Imam preaches.  You'd have to send in an undercover agent to every little shithole out there to infiltrate the village and sniff around to get an idea what this refugee is all about.  It's untenable.

I know for a fact that the majority of the nation has no fucking clue what life is like outside the developed world.

We definitely need to overhaul, refine, and rework our immigration/refugee processes.  If we can't get a positive picture of what they are about, and they are from a violent culture, sorry, it's not worth the risk to the homeland.  IF they can be checked out, AND they want to BE American, not just live in America, then bring 'em on in!
In much the same way they are concerned of "islamophobia" while for the past 1500 years muslims have performed jihad on the west. Barbary coast slavery was many times worse than US slave trade and in many Islamic countries slavery to this day is still tolerated and practiced. Total death toll of Jihad exceeds 100 million plus the complete decimation of entire ethnicities and cultures in the middle-east and north-Africa. But schools only teach how bad the few retaliatory crusades were.
Uhhhh maybe they should start falling in line then and start acting like civilized people instead of a bunch of cavemen if they are "so scared of backlash."

When the fuck has there been any pure aggression towards their community other than random arson cases or people screaming shit at them. 

Muslims are the epitome of the term snowflake. 
I don't get the thought process these terrorists have.  This guy at OSU said he hated how people thought of refugees/muslims as bad people and were scared of them.  Well no shit Sherlock, when you go around stabbing, running over, and blowing yourself up people are going to be afraid of other refugees and muslims.  That's just how people are wired to think.  Take spiders for example.  People are scared of sharks.  Does that mean all sharks are bad?  No.  Will all sharks kill you?  No.  But you better believe there are some sharks out there that will fuck your shit up.  People tend to generalize their fears.  As always, a few bad apples spoil it for the rest of the bunch. 
liberal logic is my favorite oxymoron.
I've never understood this. I see articles and posts saying "We Muslims are afraid of backlash because of this event. Please stop targeting us, we're not bad". But when has there ever been backlash that is worse than or even remotely equal to the crime? Genuinely curious because I don't see why attention should be brought to them when there's no real threat
If someone in my house is acting up I "deal with them".

They need to deal with their communities.

In 1776 when we were tired of that English bullshit. We DID something about.

Yes yes, let the self-hating flow through you. It'll only make our numbers stronger.
You really should not use the words liberal and logic close together. 
Now now, we all know Muslims are quite fond of killing each other, too. This poor terrorist just didn't have easy access to infidels from his homelands. 
The MSM fake news mafia have a Muslim butthurt template for every terror attack.
The religion of Islam gives, at the very least, a sly nod to its followers to commit such atrocities. There is impetus and motivation behind every Islamic terror attack.
I laughed at the headline because it's been printed so many times, it is almost a parody.
This victimizes america as a whole, regardless of personal faith. Left always painting the divide. Can we just send the refugee back already? We need to control this first.
How are these commies still getting tax dollars?  I swear if conservatives just staged a tax revolt, and we all deducted the percentage from our annual taxes that go to programs like welfare, foodstamps, and all the blatantly liberal institutions the left would just cease to exist.  We're fighting them on eneven ground.  It's an uphill battle for us as we have to raise our money from people voluntarily giving us money they earned in the private sector, while the left gets to fund a whole news station that bellows their talking points 24/7 without commercials by simply dipping into the public treasury.  Plus, they have radical agencies pushing their agenda like the EPA, FDA, IRS and so on   
Well they are in their home countries, but this Liberal logic is saying Muslim Americans are the MAIN victims simply because of bad stigma 
MUSLIM

VICTIM

Hey, it lines up... it kind of rhymes... IT'S A SIGN! (-Liberal)
Funny the left wing media said the same thing in France UK and Germany, the press don't give a fuck about people being hurt physically by a muslim terrorist, ho yeah first don't hurt feeling right.
I know it's not nice to say that, but i hope one day that all the fuckhead who defend islamic terrorist get a taste of the "religion of peace"
This type of shit angers me more than the actual attacks, most of the time.  
It's the same line the media used in Europe. 
To be fair, I fear for my 2A rights after every mass shooting.
They do more than terrorism. Loudest fuckers on the planet. 
Why are they always fearing victimization after a Muslim victimizes others  FYI  Today they are killing civilians in Mosul.  Probably Muslims along with any Christian they can find.

True victim? What does that mean? Anyways the largest religious group suffering from islamic terror and militant attacks are without any doubt muslims.
I wonder how these same people would feel if they or their loved ones were the victims...
Has Cucknada's Justine Trudeau made a statement regarding this incident?
cant we just ban islam lol
I am no protege of Islam. However, that being said does not mean one cannot form basic understanding of the underlying culture and identity of Islam. 

I personally believe that just because you do not act upon the violent nature of your religion does not make you any more morally just. And it does not justify your religion as peaceful. 
They're always fearing the backlash that never happens
I guess they're scared because all Muslims get persecuted for the actions of a few fundamentalist Muslims. It'd be like hating on all baptists because of what those fucks in the westboro baptist church. Doesn't really seem like the right action.
Everything Libtard is just pretzel logic to avoid facts.
"Liberal Logic": Oh, people are in danger? People are threatened? Let's protect the people. We mean all the people. Humans feel threatened by terrorism. Muslims are human. Who would have thought that they're as scared as anyone else? They're scared, you're scared, we're scared, and it's not doing anyone any good to be grouping each other into categories like this. Fuck all, people. 

"Liberal Logic" starts to sound like basic logic. 
Racism has been politicized by both parties, when we stop using racism to fit a narrative we can have a better understanding of what racism really means. What makes racism wrong is the hate and not which skin color is more oppressive or privileged. We need to also understand that many people feel or think racist thoughts for a reason, not that racism in and of itself is ok but that people who feel this way have valid reasons to feel angry. We should address rather than silence them or bash them.
Fuck muslims that attack innocent people and fuck retards that attack people just because they are muslims.
I feel stupid for asking, but is there or has there been violent retaliation towards Muslims after attacks in the US specifically? 

Because if there is the lib media has been missing out on some prime "Islamophobia".
Multiple yearly Islamic terror attacks on US soil against US citizens are completely normal even though they were pretty rare just 2 decades ago. But Muslims really are the true victim here. No need to be racist against the Islamic religion.
Serious question:  How do you take anyone who is seriously religious serious?
women are the primary victims or war etc.
Every time...
Of course. This is known.

Just like how the main victims of war are women.

Why would anyone question these facts? Also, Osama did nothing wrong.
"Stop breaking the laws asshole"
Surprised CNN didn't say "Attacker armed with Butcher Assault Rifle" 
#FAKE NEWS
These headlines are verbatim of the headlines that happened after the Crossroads Mall attack. Interesting also is the attack was very similar: younger Somali immigrant; hit people with a car; used knives; shot dead. 
Fuck the Media.

THEY did this not us. If muslims feel unsafe in America it's because of the media, not because of US citizens. 
I mean, I fear being **literally** slashed, but lulnah, I'm white, doesn't matter, I should take it like I'm supposed to.
When can we finally shut down the MSM for inciting violence? 
2015 averaged 43 homicides per day. Good thing we pay this much attention to all of them. All 15,000+. 
Are we forgetting the hundreds of thousands if not millions of dead, injured, homeless, and starving Muslims in countries war torn by terrorism?
I love (I don't) when they say, "REEEEEEE muslims kill more muslims than they do westerners!"

Like, oh, okay... they even kill each other, and in even greater numbers... bring 'em on in!
While the liberal logic is failing, as always, in a certain way they are correct; the majority of those dead by the acts of Islamic terror are other Muslims.
We should unite in solidarity to support malaria. It is the true victim of all the deaths it causes. 
Yes, of course. Because they're the real victims here. /s
Aren't those dead people usually muslims?
Never understood why people who grow up in such an alien culture come here and want to retain their cultural identity.  Weren't they fleeing from those shitholes?

This is like Californians moving to Colorado and then proceeding to shit all over this beautiful state, turning it into what they were fleeing.
When do we get permission to at least be afraid or even "cautious".
You know what else inspires attacks like these? Twitter allowing radical Muslim groups like ISIS to post on twitter. Meanwhile conservative accounts are banned, but ISIS and pedophilia is A-OK!.
Why dont the muslism community's pull their head out the aand and report suspicious activity instead of hiding it. You do it to yourself and thats the part that hurts the most - some singer
I know! Members of your religion constantly kill people, including hundreds a year in western countries, and suddenly it's like your faith is suspect or something.
DAMN RIGHT TERRORISTS FEAR BACKLASH!

As for the innocent Muslims, don't worry. Liberals are the racist ones, and they're on your side. There won't be backlash for you.
I think that headline means whitelash
i think one of their arguments is how many Muslims were killed by Americans compared to how many Americans were killed by Muslims, which is a point to look at
Wait, where does it say "true victims"? Why isn't there a link to the article?
Well, they do kill each other in their region of the world more than they kill us in the US, since Islam is totally compatible within itself... 
They deserve the backlash. When there are so many "bad apples" coming from your group, your group is bad.
Liberal here and I'd like to say "WTF??!!!  WHAT?! WHO? WHY?" thank you for your time. 
Is there any evidence that he was linked to al Qaeda/ISIS aside from his religion? If this wasn't a religious thing but was instead yet another college "shooting" like VT, why would there be backlash to the local Muslims?

I made a satirical comment here with this line of reasoning yesterday... it seems I memed irresponsibly. 
Muslims have more deaths than anyone else (they're closer to these groups than the US), so in THAT sense it's right. 

But clearly everyone suffers. 
That's not liberal logic.  stop baiting all these poor internet kids 
That's not liberal logic.  stop baiting all these poor internet kids 
There are many elements to a story. Be it the hero, the villain, the setting, the consequence and IMO there is room for all of them in the media.


The problem is biased and insane news stories who say the killer was victim and make up a brain cancer of a narrative that's insane.
Why would you change from your pure Aabic Muslim lifestyle to that of the dirty kuffar?  Even Muslims know it's the fucking current year.

We should kick those islamic terrorists out of the country so that friendly muslims can stay here and enjoy American freedom.
I would say they should put other Muslims in line but they already have sharia officers and that's a failure of a system. 
What bugs me is they have no issue standing against countrymen to push signaling. 
I think it's insane to say they are the most affected group, however you also have to realize that there are Muslims here in the US who are entirely devoted to peace and just want to live their lives as normal Americans. Maybe the way to stop these attacks is not to blame it on all Muslims(and before you say it, I do think we need stricter refugee laws. In fact, I think they need to stick in their own country or evacuate to somewhere closer but that's a whole different discussion) but instead we should make am effort to be friendlier with them. If we're friends, they'll assimilate faster and we can red pill them.
Well, didn't Hillary herself say that women are the primary victims in war? 
muslims needn't worry.. they can still just go home and beat their wives like normal.
The media always does this. They care more about those doing the killing, than those being killed. The same applies to their attitude toward Castro.
I think when people say this, they generally mean the Muslims in the middle east who deal with the majority of terror attacks. 
Why aren't regular Muslims distancing themselves from this crap? If radical Christians were out murdering people, there would be all kinds of church groups publicly protesting to show opposition.
Well in a sense they are because most of the people slaughtered by Muslim terror attacks are Muslims.  
They should fear a backlash. We ought to drive these fools back across the Atlantic. 

New crusades when?
It's a bit of a leap to go from "Muslims fear backlash" to "liberals think that Muslims are true victims and not killed and injured."

We can talk about the potential backlash and still understand who the "true" victims of the attack are.
That's wrong. But going too far is also wrong. Again, even if the muslims in these communities believe in pedophilia, rape and murder, they are still lawful citizens (assuming) of the US and need to be treated as such.

One of the major foundations of the constitution is the right to practice any religion you want and if we are true americans, we need to respect those rights.

Is someone a satanist in your neighborhood? Do they eat babies and sacrifice to Moloch? No? Do they follow the laws and not interfere with anyone's livelihood in a violent way? Yes? Then leave them alone. 

You don't have to like them or live near them but if they follow the law (no murder, rape, theft, etc) then don't kick them out on the basis of religion alone.

What you guys are doing is dumping the entire bushel of apples even though only around a dozen of them are rotten.
Guessing none of you realize more muslims die to islamic terror than probably all of the western world combined. üôÉ. In reality, they are the "real" victims.

Hello Trump, and the new dawn of real facts and real truths.

Perhaps Kek will make her resign.
Just FWIW, guys, right wing sites like patriotnation and conservative post SAID she said that during her AP interview, but I can't find a single primary source anywhere that shows she actually said that. The big tell is when you look at the interview on the Associated Press itself, she actually dismisses the idea of Trump winning at all.

So the actual interview doesn't have her discussing it, but a bunch of sites quote lengthy and **different** diatribes from that interview that I can't find any indication of that any of these quotes actually exist; so much to everyone's disappointment, this idea that she said she would resign if trump won has **fake news** written all over it.

Stay sharp, pedes, even in debunking stuff that we *wish* was true.
Who cares, she's going to die on March 25th anyway.
Im really appauled that she would do this. Judges should be honest and impartial to their core. How can we have someone this biased on the supreme court? 
Fuck this old bitch man.  She's the fucking devil.  GTFO!!!!


Wouldn't this be counter productive for her? Trump would just replace her with somebody who is the opposite.
OP HERE: I have been informed that RBG did not directly say she would resign if **DONALD J. TRUMP** were elected President. However, she did involve herself in the election, which is a breach of her ethical duties as a Justice of the Court, and as such, she should resign.
She didn't actually say that. She said something like "maybe it's time we move to New Zealand", but the story about her saying she would resign is unsourced.
He's still alive?
I learnt that a judge must keep his or her impartiality towards political affairs. 

She had spoken against Trump. 

She can no longer be impartial when it comes to cases relating to Trump administration.

She should resign.
I wonder if she thought Obama would be able to replace her? Libshits do live in a majestic fantasy world.
democrats put a gun to her head and said ride it out.
Trey Gowdy for Supreme Court and i quote him: "May justice be done though the heavens fall".
**GTFO THEN**
Bye, bitch.
Id guess about the same time trump releases his tax returns.  
Does she even know where she is? Or that she is still a Justice?
Ruth Baader Meinhof.

**OUT ! OUT ! OUT !!!**
This rotten creature has stunk up the Supreme Court since 1993 ( thx Mr? Rapist Bill). Resign you old communist hag! She's 83 but looks 93.
Just another lib who was so sure he'd never win that she felt safe making outrageous declarations
Get rid of Kagan and Sotomayor while you are at it.
Was saying this supposed to change votes?  It probably made more people vote for trump 
Should probobly thank her for all the Trump votes first...then force her off the bench.
Ginsuberg? Can she still stay sharp after cutting through all those laws? 
somewhere there is a Monastery missing its cranky old bat of a Nun
Did Scalia promise to peacefully die in his sleep in TX if Obama was elected?
Supreme court justices shouldnt be commenting on politics in the executive branch anyways. Not only because judges are supposed to be impartial arbiters of the law, but because there is actual legal precdedent that sounds in that principle. One case, for starters, is the first fucking significant case the Supreme Court decided...*Marbury v. Madison*...

EDIT: I realize she didnt say that she would leave the country, but I do remember her partisan comments 
I just feel sorry for this old man. 
GTFO Ruth. Traitor.
Supreme Court Justice should not use their position to influence political campaigns.
So where's the petition at that demands her resignation?
She is going to. A republican congress will be able to indict her for violation of her ethics pledge. She Will see I not coming after the inauguration, and will resign. I'd say mid February.
It was just ART! REEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Pictured: Rachel Maddow 2056
Impeach her.  Easy.  Did you know impeachment was very common during the formative years of our Federal government?
I'll be happy as long as she is outnumbered. Let her decay away.
You said you'd resign. Now be a woman and keep your word!!
#DID YOU JUST ASSUME ALAN GREENSPAN IS A SHE YOU SHITLORD?  REEEEE!
she looks like a bird rofl
You could split wood with that face.
Because it would look bad for the based to call for the resignation of one of the remaining liberal judges. Imagine how the cucks and media would see that? 
This senile Cryptkeeper looking piece of an activist Liberal turd, is proof that there should be an Age Limit for SCOTUS appointees.
http://www.bio-foto.com/albums/Ensifera_Caelifera/Saga-pedo-IMG_7335.jpg
Let her resign after Trump is sworn in.
She looks like a grasshopper.
The¬†Constitution of the United States¬†provides that federal judges shall hold their offices during good behavior, which means that they cannot be discharged but can be impeached for misconduct.


SHE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED FOR MISCONDUCT
Has anyone who threatened to quit/leave something if Trump wins actually deliver?
make her resign!
Don't worry, the gelfings are almost extinct and when they go so do the skexies.
http://heavy.com/news/2016/10/watch-supreme-court-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-calls-trump-a-faker/ for the shills, SJWs and concern trolls. This cunt needs to resign!

‚ÄúHe is a faker,‚Äù the 83-year-old justice told CNN. ‚ÄúHe has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ‚Ä¶ How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.‚Äù

She also criticized Trump in July interviews with the New York Times and the Associated Press.

Ginsburg told the Times, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine what this place would be ‚Äî I can‚Äôt imagine what the country would be ‚Äî with Donald Trump as our president. For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even want to contemplate that.‚Äù

She also said her late husband, Martin Ginsburg, would have said, ‚Äú‚ÄòNow it‚Äôs time for us to move to New Zealand,‚Äô‚Äù if Trump became president while he was alive.

Ginsburg also told the Associated Press she does not want to envision a Trump presidency.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs,‚Äù Ginsburg said.

**Trump called for her resignation in a tweet.**

‚ÄúJustice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot ‚Äì resign!‚Äù Trump tweeted.

Ginsburg later apologized for her comments, calling them ‚Äúincautious,‚Äù in an interview with NPR.

**‚ÄúI did something I should not have done,‚Äù** she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over and done with and I don‚Äôt want to discuss it anymore.‚Äù

During the debate Wednesday, Trump said Ginsburg made harsh comments about him and his supporters.

**‚ÄúShe was forced to apologize, and apologize she did,‚Äù** Trump said at the debate.
Her and everyone threatening to move if he one should be deported. You don't get to make threats while you throw a temper tantrum and then pussy out when you still lose. Fucking leave you traitors
Typical Liberal - spew lies. Pile of shit with flies.
We want her to resign after Jan 20th. Sure it doesn't look like obama will fill the 9th empty spot before then, but if he's got two empty spots then maybe he'll try harder 
I hate her. And I hate how many women my age revere her. 
It was stupid for her to be impartial during an election and she's Grade A douche because of it, but SCOTUS appointments are lifetime appointments (or until they choose to resign) and I have no patience for folks with an agenda (left or right) demanding SCOTUS resignations. 

TL;DR - honor your Constitution 
She hasn't lost her ability to say "14th Amendment" so she's still good, for her that is.
What a shrew
If we retweet this enough at Kellyanne im sure she can get trump to call her out!
If she doesn't resign, it means her credibility is as good as Miley Cyrus and Rosie O'Donut.
In fairness, she's actually an "anti-abortion of a justice".

I mean, look at this broad. She's at least 900 years old.
Doing what you say you will do requires a spine.  You are expecting entirely too much of even our supreme court justices.
We will replace her with someone much better. For life. 
Give her a few more days. She just donated $17 to Jill Stein. 
Did she really say that? I thought she said something like she 'can't imagine living in a world where Trump is elected'?
Proof that she is a liar
That is the dumbest thing I heard. I hate trump so much that I will let him have another slot on the supreme Court to fill
She was appointed by the rapist, she better resign!
Folks, this is a vote of confidence.  It means she wants Trump to appoint her replacement.

Just go, lady.  We need your seat to Make America Great Again.  
She looks like a goddamn witch.
I forgot all about that.  At the time, I immediately though the old bat had gone senile, since the last thing that would further her interests would be to resign and let Trump get another pick. 

She better get Hillary's medical team lined up to last for 8 years. 
What a punchable face.
She won't last 8 more years. She will be dead and replaced before Trump leaves office. 
Even if I agreeded with the bitch I'd want her to resign. She is so old she litterally can't stay awake during hearings. How can someone preside over the most important court in the world when they can't stay awake for a few hours?
I'm calling bullshit on this. I can't find any source that she said she would resign. This seems like trolling to me.

Do you think a 13 year-old rabid Trump supporter would like it?  My son is all about MAGA.  I raised that boy right!
A fellow centipede talked several months back about having worked at a Trump golf course and having a chance to meet the man.  He asked something like "what is the secret of your success?" and Trump said "I want to do something, everybody fights me on it, I do it anyway, then everybody loves it."  

From years ago!  It was sublime.  

Edit: [found the thread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4fn9b2/i_worked_at_one_of_mr_trumps_golf_courses_for_4/)

Here is the full correct quote: 

>I asked him, "Mr. Trump, how do you succeed so well in everything you do?"

>He said to me, "I'll tell you how it is: I want to do something, everyone fights me about it, I do it anyway, and then everyone loves it."  

Thanks /u/Tomes2789, I love this story and have thought of it many times in the last several months.
I can't wait till my copy arrives tomorrow. Will read it holding it high so that everyone on the train can get triggered. 
Man, I sure hope Trump eventually puts that kind of ideology to work. Maybe he could even run for a public office one day.
HIGH ENERGY CANADIAN CHECKING IN.

I just bought my copy! 

Spez: Have you read his other books? What do you think?

I read it over the summer and I had to stop and take a breath because the book is basically his blueprint for running his campaign. 

"Controversy sells"

"The media love speculation"

"Always play nice with people you want stuff from later"
I've read the book as well. I totally agree. It's like he knew all along that this was going to happen. 
Ohh right in the feelz. 
That picture with all the media "Is this the end of Trump?" headlines comes to mind.
Just finished it as well a couple of weeks. I already knew he was capable of leading this country, but this book is proof. He's had his hands in so many projects with transferable skills now on a YUUUGE scale. Can't get bigger than the USA. The way he deals with the red tape and makes calculated concessions to make great deals is amazing. I can't wait to read "Art of the Comeback" next.
But reddit told me he didn't even write it!
I read this book in 1987. While most of it was over my head at the time, I did recognize the brilliant mind inside the man and I vowed from that point forward, if he EVER ran for office, I'd be right there to support and vote for him.

I have slept SO WELL since November 8th. I have felt relaxed and energized since that night. Soon, my man will be at the helm of this ship!! #MAGA
Page 6: "I don't hold it against people that they have opposed me. I'm just looking to hire the best talent, wherever I can find it."
GREATNESS!
If you want to know what The Donald is, how he thinks, why he is what he is then this is the book for you. I've seen many centipedes talk about him playing 4-D chess, and that's exactly what he does... all the time. Not only will Donald Trump MAGA, but he will lead the world in defending freedom for all men and women. America is truly a blessed nation!

Just bought the book the other day. It's really good!
I had to save this. No need to say more.
He fucking did it!
Great book also available in audio format. Read it long time ago and been listening it on repeat for the past 6 months probably before bed. The thing is amazing and I learn something new every time through!
Awesome. Hadn't read this before.
Is there a Cliff Notes version?
I'm tearing up.  We are so frigging lucky.
Beautiful words.
Have you read "The America We Deserve"?  He wrote it back in 2000

This point can't be made enough. The "liberals" are so called allies of the minorities...but actually it's sad that they are NEVER the allies of the minorities within the minorities.
You know...the only muslim girl I know personally comes over to my house to get ready to go out to the club away from her house (lives with family) takes the hijab off and parties and flirts with any white guy who will give her the time of day (until curfew of course). I'm 25, she's maybe 23. I've always wanted to ask her what she would do if her community found out. On several occasions she hid in the bathroom because she thought she had recognized someone.  
She turns around and posts all kinds of religious shit on her insta as if she hadn't just gone out the night before in a body con, push up bra sans headscarf.

Great point of view, Ahmed. Maybe you can bring it down to the White House and tell us more. - Trump
"We need to help the Muslims, they're oppressed! #NotMyPresident"

"No we don't. We don't need your help"


"Wow what a traitor what a fucking white male fuck you fucking racist sexist non-53 gender hating meanie"


You are all delusional if you think Islam is gonna have an Enlightenment any time soon lmfao
Easy for you to say you racist white male racist mysogoracist xenoracist racist priviloracist racist. islamoracist
Wow, never thought about comparing the Radical, 7th century based version of Islam with pre-enlightenment Christians. Makes a lot of sense. If two of the largest institutions in the country, the media and higher education, had a modicum of historical and societal understanding we may be able to unify and begin to tackle this abhorrent ideology once and for all. SAD!
It's all very simple when you think about it. I've been saying this for a long time. "When a person, or group of people openly declare that they WILL NOT abide by the laws and rules of a civilized society, then like a tumor, that person, or group of people MUST be removed from that society." MacWell 2010
Cool post Ahmed! Want to bring it to The_Donald?
Fuck the regressive left
Any religion still using a code of laws from 609AD needs a reform. I'm sad it took so long for the Muslims themselves to catch on and start calling for it. At this point, it may be too little, too late.
But, but, but... muh narrative!!

dear allah. i am literally shaking from this Islamophobia. I would go to the safe space but it got blown up making cultural enrichment tools. 
The problem with this post is that is suggests that Islam is the motive for terrorism in the Middle East. The fact is, there is no evidence to suggest this. What religion is blamed for Hitler, Stalin, and Pablo Escabar? I guarantee you that if Hitler was Muslim people would have called him a terrorist.
Holy shit this is brilliant. Islam needs it's own [reformation. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation)

Know how painful Christian reformation was, right? So painful. Wonder how this Islamic reformation is going...
So Muslims now get unlimited twitter characters? /s
sorry to be dramatic, but this may be the single most important post on reddit i've seen in a long time
The thing is, regressives do not *want* to help muslims. They want to perpetuate the idea that they are oppressed and the only way to help them is to implement the regressive agenda.

Same for women and other minorities.

Seems like with the Information Age, this will be the pattern and we will see religions mostly go away in 1st world countries within a few short generations.


Once they give up the violent aspects and become peaceful, they have time to really examine what it is their religion actually is, which leads to less and less faith until they become agnostic or atheist. It looks like the natural progression.
That is not a goddamned tweet you moron. It is a fucking Facebook post. Jesus Christ, how stupid must you be to not know the difference.

Trump is trolling. He's hoping some ultraliberals will start burning flags in protest, so the media will have pictures of protesters with burning American flags. It also rallies support with evangelicals.
So many people will get BTFO today, believe me.
Trump gets the reactionary left to cry, then they ~and everyone else listening~ gets hit with the truth about their blatantly hypocritical stances. Top Down justice.

Hillary stuck her head up with this recount crap, now he's publicly shaming her and her followers  about their hypocrisy.  You couldn't more explicitly call out someone and their followers for their hypocrisy.    This is brilliant. 
Trump baits them so often, and yet they keep taking it. 
Listen: I always assumed this "4D chess" stuff was just rationalized chest thumping on the part of this sub, but this move makes me think it's legit.
7D underwater water polo 
Let me crosspost this to /r/Politics and get banned.
He is a master at baiting.   ;) 
This just proves Trump had his Time Machine way back in 2005.
I remember when it was illegal and never thought it should be protected free speech.  I wonder if there is a serious possibility to get that decision overturned.  At any rate, I expect the left to double-down on flag burning during their protests which just makes them seem anti-American to a lot of people.
What's so hilarious here is if Trump uploaded a video of himself burning the American flag, they would yell hate crime.

"It's different if you're running for public office."

So I guess only Hillary can have public and private opinions.


I thought it was a stupid comment at first but the more i think about it the more i like it. Whenever a lib is elected we fear for our gun rights, even though that is clearly protected by the 2A. We worry that God will be pushed out of influential spaces and replaced by empty values and morals, like cups waiting to be filled with the drink of radicals, racists, and those who profit from chaos and strife. We worry about government growth and further decay of the constitution even though it is a limiting document that says the gubmint CAN'T do this this this, all else is up to the states to decide. We worry that a leftist leaning SCOTUS will scuttle the last of the common sense we have left for ourselves. We always worry about federal money for abortions, tax hikes on small businesses etc.

 Its about time we attacked back and made the left feel the pressure i have felt my entire adult life, that everything they believe in must be sacrificed on the altar of politics and progress. Let them know what it feels like to feel like they are the last sane person left alive on a planet full of crazy assholes who want nothing more than to destroy, to tear down, to rebel against everything traditional, everything normal.

 So fuck them and their ideology, lets have a fire sale on everything the left holds dear and show them that this election wasnt just another election that it was America blowing off layers of dust and everything that has fallen to disrepair in our union will be made whole again, that America will be great again! Lets show them that this was an election for the quiet simple forgotten person who has been attacked and vilified and disrespected for only wanting to carve out a little space for themselves and their families and their traditions. 

 GODDAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO WIN AGAIN!!!!

Under budget: it is an email suggestion box wherein an invited group (e.g. Nigel Farrage, Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Milo Polyandrous, Steven Crowder, James O'Keefe, Alex Jones, Howie Carr, Laura Ingraham, Michelle Malkin,  certain private U.S. citizens - and some non-U.S. - off here and Twitter and Facebook, and many others in total numbering 76 people) drop suggestions for "trolling" as and when they occur. These are continually assessed by three assessors before they are offered to The Don for judgment yea or nay. 

We are at drift net trolling proportions now.

I invite any of the these schmucks to go to a foreign country and burn their flag and see how they make it out

They have to stop taking everything he says literally. 

They fall for the bait everytime. 
So when they asked Hillary what she had accomplished as a Senator, this bill couldn't be included because it didn't pass.

She also voted against the same bill as an amendment, which fell three votes short of passing in the senate.  So what does she really believe here anyways?
Why would anyone think people would get properly triggered about burning the confederate flag?

And there it is. [4D chess in action.](https://i.sli.mg/rtHgvP.gif) 
They don't care. Anything to oppose Trump.
Liberals are such idiots. Yeah burning the flag is freedom of speech but that flag also represents the sacrifice of our armed forces. If you have been given a folded flag then you wouldn't be out there burning it in some stupid protest paid for by Soros. I know how it feels to watch them fold and hand that flag over in honor of service. So fuck you to everyone who thinks burning our flag is cool. My heart broke accepting our flag and it's not a feeling I'll ever forget.
[deleted]
We are allowed to disagree on this sub, right?:

I believe flag-burning should be allowed, as it is an expression of free speech. I do not support burning the american flag, I only support the **right** to burn the american (and every other) flag.
That's our God Emperor!
So glad you posted this. I was so confused. Now it makes sense! 51D Transdimensional Tic Tac Toe in action!
The mad man knew it. Baited again.
What if you thought it was stupid either way? 
I would oppose it no matter who said it. It's the suppression of free speech. It says that the flag is sacred and that disrespecting the country by burning a flag is an awful thing and says that America can't take criticism of what it stands for. Any country that cannot take criticism is not able to be free.  

It bothers me especially that Donald Trump says this because I feel his rise is partly on the backs of those that were suppressed themselves. To abandon that and start encouraging the restriction of burning flags is a bit of a slap in the face.
Ahahahhaha God emperor shitposter-elect playing 6D eels and escalators. He straight up word for word proposed exactly what Hillary proposed. Now when people get mad and burn flags in protest....he can point out how it was Hillary's idea
The punishments for burning a flag is a bit different but it is a violation of our first amendment right in both occasions. 
I don't support this.

I also don't support Hillary Clinton.
This is the chance for pedes to show their integrity.

It's already illegal to burn a flag.. that you don't own. If you're buying flags and burning them then you're just helping out some patriotic company that makes flags.

As a veteran I think it's pretty dangerous to be implying there should be a law against free speech. It's also impractical, the supremes would certainly overturn it in like 5 min and he needs to be doing other things, like deporting 'undocumented' immigrants who voted, and are now *by definition* felons and **illegal immigrants** any way you want to slice it.

But, I find it very troublesome Trump said this, and people on the right need to have more integrity than people on the left who support everything their guy does because he's their guy.

I hope he just meant there should be consequences like "people should boycott them or ostracize them", not like "they need to be arrested".

If he meant the latter, as a veteran who swore to protect the Constitution, I don't appreciate a president who is undermining it. I never appreciated it with Obama, and I hope Trump isn't heading down that path before he's even in office.

There are 10 Amendments and they are all important. If you buy a box of guns or a box of flags, that's your right. If you burn either, that's also your right.

If you burn flags in public, you're a douche, but it's your right to be a douche.
Such a shame that she couldn't get shit done!
Great work. Thanks for posting this. 
If Hillary does it: OK!

If Trump does it: NO!

:(
Trump is a fucking genius.
But Trump is for it now so we have to oppose it!!!
I been saying this shit for years. No clue why anyone thinks it's acceptable. 
What font is that? Someone answer please.

Kek, they want to burn the confederate flag instead. Nothing better than making people from the Southern states feel victimized for absolutely no reason.

#TOP SHELF SPICE
MSM shitting all over themselves over President Trump comments.
Sharing this on FB to all my friends who are freaking out about Trump: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005

Feels good to keep proving them wrong. ;)
Yeah but that was just her public position not her private position... and she's probably changed her views by now anyways /s (sadly not /s).
Trump reminds me of that quote about the American militaries. How the Japanese an Germans can't predict what the Americans will do because they themselves don't know, and this makes America a difficult enemy. American then comes out to say, yea we don't really know what we're doing. The implication being that keeping up the guise of being an idiot, even though damaging to the reputation, is a great strategy. Trump allows himself to be ridicules, knows his reputation can sustain it, and accomplishes what no polical pawn can predict
I had a team of scientists look into the mindset of liberals. We had 1000 case study volunteers. They came to the conclusion there brains have been hacked by the "MSM" & unfortunately due to them being badly damaged it makes liberals incredibly stupid. Next we will be comparing Libs to monkeys to see who is smarter. Will keep you updated on the results. 
When they reply with "that was 11 years ago....people change" you reply with "oh! Just like the bus conversation!"
Finally some actual worthwhile content in this sub.  
yes, he was just trolling. He IS the God-Emperor
Lel. 
They're all just going to downvote in denial. Some of their are just so fucking ignorant and in denial lol
ah, the old #trumptrap stumps them again.

will the hoaxing media never learn?
Dude is smart, this was a set up by DJT. 
politics took the bait and posted the same thing not knowing the Shill proposed this already. 
Clinton isn't running anymore. Trump won. Stop comparing his words to hers, because he has to stand on his own now. 

If he isn't trolling, this is super fucked up. If he is trolling, *he needs to get over Clinton* and be serious about being president. Clinton's opinions and past are no longer relevant.
I'm watching some FB friends freak out and deciding if I involve myself and point this out...

No explanation will be sufficient for this god-level triggering. They don't want to understand it.
It was all for show and votes.
Wanna protest something unfair?  Then you should use your words to bring to our attention, to persuade, to educate..protesting through destruction is vitriolic and does not change minds.  Inflammatory only plays to baser instincts and we are supposed to be better than that.
My facebook is going insane right now, and because of work i refuse to post anything on social media about politics at all. Would really like to post this in some comments.
but that was just her public position
I thought we didn't like people that destroyed the flag? Now we're okay with desecrating the flag because Hilary didn't?
Stop the presses! That law was only if you burned it to INCITE (create) VIOLENCE (simply burning it isn't illegal at all), you can check check congress.gov.
We should limit the first amendment.  People should not be saying and doing these things
HA! But it's not in CURRENT YEAR. Checkmate Drumpfets. 
she lost tho. nobody cares about hillary anymore. your guy won. you have to defend him and his first amendment suppression on his own merits. you cant go "b b b but hillary" every time 

you are all so stupid

I remember 1994, working in a textile factory, loading trucks with our plant's equipment heading to Mexico. President Bill Clinton on the TV on my warehouse desk claiming that no Americans would lose their job due to NAFTA. I obviously wasn't an American to him. I feel like an American today.
you're a big factory
He built his army. Now he's arming us.
Union bosses must be pissed! They've spent the past year telling everyone how much a biggot Trump is...
Another 1000 families get to eat and pay bills, rather than the possibility of becoming homeless. 
fuck obama.. he has never done anything like this for america.. trump genuinely cares about america. 
The cucked left doesn't understand the pride and dignity of hard work - the only thing they make are excuses.
Now try to imagine Obama fighting for American jobs. 
It's gonna be a great Christmas in Indiana!
It's simply incredible.
Obama is probably shitting his pants 
#AT CHRISTMAS TIME, NO LESS. PRESENTS WILL BE UNDER THE TREE BIGLY THIS YEAR FOR THE KIDDOS!!
Ladies and gentlemen, take a good hard look at this man. This is what a president is supposed to look like.
Yeah Obama's numbers look great because all of the people who aren't listed as "unemployed" are just lazy fucks not looking for work and mooching off the government teat
#WHO IS CUTTING THE DAMN ONIONS?!?!
I do imagine and remember back years ago... losing a job... fear and that was when the economy was good. I feel them before and after. Now we don't have to imagine, we finally have a President who cared enough to make a difference in people's lives. 

He didn't have to do this and HE DID!
Kevin O'Leary wants to run for leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada.

If that happens, and he manages to move his way into leadership in Canada, how fucking buttblasted will Mark Cuban be?

On the bright side, 40-50 years from now, our future PM will have Trump's genetic stock.

#Mr. Wonderful just jumped on the TRUMP TRAIN. NO BRAKES!!!
Is this what console gaming is like?
Relevant: https://youtu.be/8s3UogfAGg0
This is parallel to something that occurred to me in the political sphere: when Trump said he thought Farage would make a good ambassador, he fired a shot across the bow at 10 Downing St. They (according to the BBC) were 'scrambling' to come up with an appropriate reply and finally said 'there's no vacancy for that position'.

DJT put them on the spot with his patented double blind/judo move:  "give me Farage as ambassador OR face the wrath of the electorate when they see how badly things are going because I am not getting what I want."  

NOW, DJT has had a talk with Justin and Justin is willing to renogotiate NAFTA AND ANYTHING ELSE TRUMP WANTS. 
Oh to be a fly on the wall with that conversation - Justin and Donald.  WHAT did DJT say?!

... everyone keeps saying Justin is a cuck - but 5'8" PIERRE [pbuh] was the cuck; Justin is 6'2" and Fidel was 6'3". Not only that, but Justin is the SPITTIN' IMAGE of Fidel.
More like Godzilla and a rabbit
Fucking losers. Trump vs O'Leary would be like Star Craft vs Tic Tac Toe as well.

O'Leary is a tard on Cuban's level. He'd be minced meat. Donald Trump is now negotiating with the Chinese and Iranians (and winning). These cucks wouldn't even be able to negotiate a loss
Satisfaction, is what this is...
OMG They have to compete in business. They're screwed!

Hnnnnggggg. This real talk 
Had no clue that he was Canadian lol 
Wow, I didn't realize how respected Trump is outside of the msm brainwashing narrative. I just know I voted for him even though they said he was gonna lose in a landslide, and now I've never had more hope for America. I hope Trump continues to do really well so that all of those so called experts lose their jobs for their biased coverage of president Trump. #prayforTrump
Bring back Rob Ford.
Kevin O'Leary should run for the conservative party. He might not be on the same level as God Emperor, but he seems to be a pretty smart businessman.
YEAHHHHHH BOYYYYYYYYYY!!!!

I so don't think about whereever redacted is I don't even get the joke. So, upvoat.
What is this /r/[redacted]? Did I miss something?
Every now and then I go in there to see if I can actually have a conversation with someone.  Did that today on a post saying there is no voter fraud.  Backed up my points with links and definitions, and all I got in return was stubbornness bordering on stupidity.  

It's such a sad little echo-chamber. All salt, no spice.
The rest of Reddit is so gay now. I use to visit a lot of subs but now I realize how completely cucked they actually are. 
what's r/redacted? I've seen the sub around but what's their shtick?
Concerning r/[redacted]: The story is that up to about a month or two (or three?) ago, this sub would often talk about the problems going on in r/ poltics. Well, the mods over there (mainly CTR shills) reported this sub for brigading or something, and this sub's mods were basically threatened that if we kept linking to the politics sub, we'd get shut down for violating reddit rules.

Knowing that reddit would love to have an excuse to shut down the_donald, we were warned to stop linking to politics. Many users started referring to it as r/[redacted] instead. When that first started, there wasn't actually an r/redacted sub; that sub was formed after we started referring to r/ politics as r/redacted. When you see r/redacted, we're actually talking about the default politics sub.
So true. We're just minding our own business and they literally spend every waking hour thinking about us and how to ~~destroy~~ fix us.

Edit: This comment was totally not edited by u/spez believe me
I legit forgot all about it. I haven't been there in many months. 
It's turned into a liberal echo chamber.
Just made a post on r/redacted. Can't say I blame them for defending their candidate, but they are rabid.
Good.

Liberals now stating states and cities CAN ignore federal law need to answer why states and cities CANNOT ignore the 1965 Civil Rights Act. (which is the entire underpinning of the the law that stopped segregation) 
The laws against harboring illegal aliens, the sanctuary cities, and the officials who broke the laws to make sanctuary cities already exist.

What these flaccid cucks need to do is stop talking about passing new laws, muh new policy, how they are going to fix things, and get the police to arrest and prosecute the people at the top who run sanctuary cities. 

Prosecute people. Put them in jail. Have a trial. Then put them in prison. How many times do you think that needs to occur before liberal city cucks immediately bend the knee. 

Once? Twice? 
How the fuck is sanctuary city a thing? Illegal immigrant is an illegal immigrant. Keyword is illegal
You know it's a sad fucking day when enforcing a nation's laws is "standing tall".  Good on him all the same, lots of pressure to do otherwise.  Keep the bullshit in Texas to Laredo / El Paso pls.
Member when abortion barbie thought she was going to be governor? Haha, I'm glad she's not here to "protect" sanctuary cities like those dopes in california and illinois.

More need to hop on the ban wagon too. Trump needs to stop all money coming into LA and San Francisco (sanctuary cities) since they refused to follow our immigration laws. Our lovely police chief Beck and manor of LA stated that they will not enforce the law and will continue to protect and stand by the illegal immigrants. Studies have shown in 2013 that 1 in 10 people are illegal in LA which cost billions of dollars for their education, free health care and welfare programs. Many parts of LA resembles a third world country.

Oh MSM. Oh I truly truly love you.  My day has been splendid watching your double talk. I love winning. 
I like how the article was just sneakily edited to put that other guys name before hillary's
I don't get it. Can someone explain?
I wonder how much the prison industry paid her to sponsor this bill?
a response i got about posting the wikipedia link, no lie, was:

"but it failed to pass, and is over 11 years old. It's irrelevant"

such hypocrisy
This is bait so his critics start burning American flags, only pushing more support towards Trump
Should be longer then a tear buying your country's flag 
I can respect that.
2005 wasn't that long ago, but I wonder... Hillshills brushed this same sort of shit off when she opposed gay marriage. What would you say to people who say "well she just held that opinion back then because it was the prevailing attitude" just like toward gay marriage?
I love that Trump added the small detail of changing the 100,000 dollar fine to loss of citizenship. He didn't want to make the trolling to obvious! Hahahahah
SOMEONE GET THS TO THE GOD EMPEROR
That said we cannot allow this to happen in case it's real. We have to know when to step up for what we fight for and not just the person.
Did you actually read the bill? If you had, you would have realized this Wikipedia article is literally inaccurate.
If you actually read the text of the bill you'd know it only provides MAXIMUM sentences for flag-burners. Hillary is not advocating for "one year in jail and $100,000 fine," she's saying that's the CAP sentence any flag-burner should be privy to. There's a big difference.
Liberals right now:"If if burn the flag, Trump gets even more supporters. If I attack Trump on the proposed law, I also attack Hillary Clinton" That's what I call 5D check mate.

Poor boyscouts of America.
Now it's been edited to name Hillary as a "co-sponsor." These shills try so hard!!

We want someone who will work with President Trump, not Pelosi who will block everything and give children nightmares.
I've got my fingers crossed for the guy.  No one could be as bad as Pelosi. What a bitch.
Honestly I hope Pelosi wins, along with Ellison for DNC Chairman. So they won't hold a majority for the next 50 years, HAHAHAHAHAHA
Yeah, lets hope Pelosi keeps it. Remember, if a man unseats a woman, its sexist. Pelosi has done so much for the Republican party, it would be a shame to lose her.
My father says we have a 1 and 1/2 party system

One party sets agenda, half party echoes it by saying the same things, claiming they can do the same things--but better

In this way,  the half party becomes the Me Too Party

Tim Ryan is my congressmen and I semi like him.  He's pissed me off on a few occasions but overall he's pretty good.
If Ryan wins, the Democratic party outside of the House/DC bubble will Freak the Fuck out! Holy shit, they will melt the fuck down. A White Male! AND it will almost guarantee radical Ellison running the DNC. Fabulous....

I just noticed the Edit button. LOL!!!!!
I hope that nightmare pelosi looses the minority leader seat. Don't know anything about her opponent but it doesn't seem to be possible that anyone could suck as much as pelosi.
Moderate republicans could at least get on board with the tea party. Moderate democrats will run like hell from the control-left and start over from scratch. The left could actually collapse.
This may not be a popular opinion in this thread, but if the goal is to truly make America great again, then ultimately the Democratic Party needs to get better too. Being in a constant battle against an increasingly radicalized party only makes accomplishing things more difficult.
Please pass the popcorn. I think this is gonna get good. 
If Pelosi remains minority leader, the party will burn to the ground.  I hope they clean house, and come back with fresh faces and fresh ideas.
We need to stand behind Pelosi! What could be better for us than her? 
What has Mr. Cuck, aka Bernie said? Or is he waiting to see which of these two shitstains offer to buy him another house. 
Let's no forget who Tim Ryan's mentor was: the based Jim Traficant. 

Traficant and Trump have a lot of similiarities, politically. 
Oh Trump will teach you how to win Tim
anyone stop to think that the house leadership on both sides will be guys named Ryan if Tim wins. The globalist machine can't stop turning out these cookie cutter hacks.
And media is letting it slide. Literally NO ONE posting it.

Why is this even surprising?  The four basic food groups - pizza, cheese, hotdogs and pasta are at the center of the DNC power base and no doubt have been for years.

fuck /u/spez
I agree.  Puppies have no enemies.
This is maybe as good a place as any to ask... The Independent wrote the article at #2 there, and in general it has been running tons of anti-Trump articles. Their top story on their website currently is, "Donald Trump lashes out at media in series of nonsensical tweets". (Srsly?) Why are they anti-Trump? Note that the Independent is owned by a Russian oligarch, and it is heavy on pro-Russia propaganda, but now they are heavy on anti-Putin propaganda. What's their deal? I've seen as many as 9 Independent articles on the front page of /r/[redacted], so one reason I want to understand the Independent's bias is to criticize it.

I've seen a lot of people on The_Donald over the last couple weeks saying our job is done. They are accusing everyone of "concern trolling" for even discussing different topics. Over the months this sub has busted out into the National narrative more than a few times. We must never stop. We KNOW our enemy never will. Never get tired of winning. There are shills on this sub trying to subvert our message. We must never stop fighting.

Is there a link to any video for this?  I was watching the live feed but it got CNN'd.
does any have video of judge ruling..looking for it...can't find the end ruling
Saw a USA Today article saying the judge denied the hand recount part at least.
She pulled a Bernie, pretty clever if you ask me
So this means another violent drunken bender for Hillary, I assume.
Dat $$$ tho. Another soul lost to the almighty dollar. Say hi to Bernie, Jill.
Green party? Oh you thought we meant trees? LOL. Sucks to suck.
Poor Jill, how will she ever recover after pocketing those millions of dollars she scammed from useful idiots. 
Why would the loser Romney, who talked shit the entire campaign, even be considered?  He is a dry sock who no world leader will take seriously.
**FUUUUUCK Mittens**
Hoping this Romney shit is just 5D chess. I will be very upset if Trump picks him for SOS. 
why did that red x on mitt's face make me laugh so much? 
If we are airing our hopes and dreams; you say: Tulsi; I'll say: Gowdy! Who better to retrace Hillary's steps than Trey Gowdy. Unlike all of the above he has been on the train since Rubio; which honestly was quite a while ago.

#REMOVE SNEK
For all the talk of draining the swamp, I'm worried the Trump administration will end up packed with lobbyists and establishment shills. Hope that some of these picks aren't final.
Yes this please!
No to both.
Fuck no. We don't need an anti-gun, liberal berntard, 35 year old with minimal foreign policy experience in Trumps top cabinet position.
Let's go Tulsi!
Tusli and Seth get snap-upvotes from this patriot
NeverRomney
Trump appoints a bunch of beautiful, qualified women to top cabinet positions. CNN accuses him of being a mysogynist for only hiring women. 
She just doesn't have the experience. I would assume this will be the most important position in the cabinet and will need someone with business and contract negotiation experience. I don't think I would turn it over to a Democrat.
Have had the pleasure of meeting this fine woman, shes an absolute powerhouse and sharp as a whip, if she doesn't get secretary of state, myself and many other republican native Hawaiians are going turn this fucking state red before 2020. 


#MAGA UP
I'm not sold on her. We barely know anything about her other than she can run a campaign and turned her back on DNC corruption, which should be a no-brainer.
Why the fuck would you guys want Tulsi Gabbard anywhere near the White House? She supports income tax increases, expand obamacare, and supports stimulus package spending.

**Tulsi Gabbard for Secretary of State**

#TULSI GABBARD For SECTRETARY OF STATE!
Hell no to any democrat in Trump's cabinet.
I'd be happy with Giuliani.




NO to these two.
Thats my secretary

Now THIS is some fucking meme magic!!
#STOP TRYING TO PUSH TULSI GABBARD, [WE WANT RUDY](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/25/poll-donald-trumps-secretary-state/)!
No Mittens and no Tulsi. Neither of these people were part of the Movement. Guiliani! 
Yeah and liberals say how Trump wants an all white admin... yeah- liberals can suck it
I think Romney may very well get a spot, but it'll be something more like heading up the VA where he can actually utilize his skillset and make it a viable department again like he did with the Olympics.
TULSI TULSI TULSI
Dems will completely meltdown. Liberals as well. Remember how right after the election a subreddit called Tulsi2020 popped up? 5D chess.
how about someone who sees eye-to-eye with Trump?
Fuck off. There are other options besides Romney and an anti 2nd amendment Democrat
We need someone who's just as pro America as Trump is, if not more 
NO; we don't need a gun hating lefty hindu getting validated by the Trump administration and being 4th chair from the presidency. She offers nothing that can't be found in another person.  
Putin will eat her alive.
Tulsi needs the experience before she becomes the first female president in 2024.
 Because everyone hates a Rom-pick is exactly why he might pick him. The Don is playing on a level we can barely follow. For all we know, Rom did what he did precisely to give Trump the neccessay wedge/separation he needed from the GOP to pull the millions of anti-establishment folks to solidify his base. Think about it, we have a master of manipulation, modivating people whom normally would not even have tuned in because government has always screwed them over.


Seriously before Romney even did his "speech" anyone with half a brain knew that attacking trump has the exact opposite affect of weakening him. I remember thing, wow that was just dumb....

The bigger question is, what makes Romney the obvious choice? What's "really" going on here?

Romney will never be Trump. He cannot withstand the withering mainstream attacks. But shielded under the Don, alot of these establishment hacks might actually be effective at helping make America Great Again. In a figurative sense we are going to war against globalism which is basically being driven by everything mainstream I'll enlist any tools I can to win that war. After all, even Obama/Hillary are just pawns in this struggle.
I don't even know if she'd be good or not...I just want this.
I feel she is worthy of a cabinet position but not Sec of State. That should go to a well seasoned person with more years on this earth with more public service and strong international experience. 

I do like Gabbard, she has integrity and should be part of this administration. 
we just gotta make sure she knows NO SERVERS IN YOUR BASMANT. 
We can find something less important for her.  This is one of the most important cabinet positions!

# No Mitt
No thanks
General Petraeus for SoS. 
Stop this stupid shit..  She is democrat snek..   
Is there anyone else besides her? I feel like she would back stab Trump on some issues. 
Guliani 
It is going to be Romney. Tulsi is a democrat and inexperienced. Not gonna happen. 

The 2nd interview was to get Romney's pledge that he would be loyal to Trump's vision and not his own.
It's a law requested by Then Failing Senator Hillary Clinton in 2005

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005

Her bill "outlawed flag burning, and called for a punishment of one year in jail and a fine of $100,000" when the flag is burned for "breach of the peace" or "intimidation". This is just Trump's way of extending an olive branch to Hillary supporters.

Trump's [tweet about punishing those who burn the American flag] (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/803567993036754944) is just his way of extending an olive branch to Hillary supporters.

It also has the potential to:

1. Bait progressive campus activists into mass flag burning
2. Bait progressive journalists into obsessing over this at the expense of more important news

Both outcomes would further drive the wedge between these groups and mainstream Americans.
Trump's tweet was perfect: stir the pot and then reveal that the pot belonged to Hillary after all! Public face say hello to private face.
Pure Trump 4D Chess.

 1. In 2005 Hillary introduced a bill for a 1 year sentence for burning American flags. If they call Trump Hitler for his comment then they must do so for Hillary.

 2. Liberals have to come to terms with people calling something "hate speech" to ban or silence it.

 
So this proves Trump had his Time Machine in 2005. 
Which one of you BASED patriots edited the entry to Shillary Clinton
Watch out for Wiki editing. They are actively trying to remove Hillary's name from it as the original co-sponsor.

I feel like this should be pushed to /r/all 
there is a guy on wikipedia continuing to edit out Hillary Clinton as a co-sponsor. He has already been flagged with a warning because of "Edit Warring"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jrinaldi97#November_2016

Would be a shame if enough people corrected his edit so that his accounts gets banned from Wikipedia
There are a lot of issues President-elect Donald Trump and his defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton disagree on. But flag burning might not be one of them.
It was a bad idea then, it's a bad idea now.
What I want to know is why flag burning okay but koran burning is not.
Hahaha it said Shillary Clinton! You 'pedes are amazing
[deleted]
This is great.
Another hole for the Hill to fall into.

Just can't stop winning!
This guy holy shit. We are witnessing something right now boys, cherish every moment
He plays on another level, period. The media simply dances to the rhythm he plays.
Wow. What a gem.
Exactly, and notice the use of the word "perhaps". Every word in his tweet was very deliberate.
/r/politics has took the bait. It's now on /r/all. LOL.
To the top!
###HOW DOES HE KEEP DOING THIS!?###
Genius.

...there's so much bait...incredible!


Gotta love team TRUMP for throwing us carnivores MEAT. Just BTFO these liberals all day with this. 
He's like a man with a laser pointer in a room full of kittens.
He's trying to start a flag burning riot. So, he will have plenty of ad footage for 2020.
Yeah, it really seems like in his spare moments he thinks to himself, "What could I tweet right now to trigger the SWJs, whip up their moral outrage against me, then point out that I'm only echoing what their own leaders have said in the past?  It's hilarious.  And I'm a Veteran who believes that an American citizen has a right to burn an American flag in protest, no matter how disgusting I feel the act of desecrating the flag is.
lmao he is honestly the greatest troll of all time

Man, Trump's senior advisor is Barron Trump, these are cyber chess moves.  
Trump's actions also remind me of how you can catch a fly in the kitchen by simply forcing it to fly every time it lands (that is, "triggering" the fly constantly!).  Eventually the fly is so exhausted you can pick it up and wash it right down the sink.
Wow
LOL... Trump just keeps the hits coming.

He just can't help but bait the media can he.

I posted a Fox Article on my page. Waiting for someone to post and then I'll respond with this.

Are you sure this is just a step? I'm rather disgruntled if he really thinks this. But this could be a pretty interesting play on Hillary.
It's a hilarious tweet and I don't think he's serious. If he is he's in the wrong.
Why bother about Hillary anymore though? 

I'd figure he'd be going after his new enemy. This is season 2 guys! 
so spicy its ridiculous 
#CHECKMATE
No Hillary's name in the paragraph anymore:

"The Flag Protection Act of 2005 was a proposed United States federal law introduced by Jonny Tomayo and Senator Bob Bennett (R-UT). The law would have prohibited burning or otherwise destroying and damaging the US flag with the primary purpose of intimidation or inciting immediate violence or for the act of terrorism. It called for a punishment of no more than one year in jail and a fine of no more than $100,000.[1][2][3]"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Protection_Act_of_2005
When i fly my flag on my property, in the wind and weather, eventually it will fade and  parts of it will tear and become missing.

so i need to replace my flag with a new one. But it's inappropriate to just throw a flag in the trash bin. It gets an honorable cremation "burial".

ELI5: how is burning a flag a problem?
https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/1911/cosponsors
I was going to say, centipedes dont actually support this right? Then I heard the music: Trump playing the media like a fiddle. :)
Hell, I HOPE HE'S SERIOUS.  If you don't want to be here, GET OUT!
Why would I worry? I've been waiting for this for years.
most american flag burning that ive seen this year was done by people waving the mexican flag. but thats just like my opinion
He's forcing their hand again.
People should be allowed to burn the flag. Its just cloth after all. And people should be allowed to set the burners clothes on fire while he doing it. Its just cloth after all. And that is what we call freedom of speech :)
It's actually kind of a regular chess move. It's just that the MSM opponent is really not very good at the game.

Loooooooooolllllllllll I love this 4d chess shit xD
Used that against someone on twitter after they compared Trump to Stalin for his tweet on the subject . Their response was "so what? She lost and we declined that idea" smh
[removed]
I still want this to be the law.
I'm starting to believe Trump is from the future, I bet he has a flying car too
Does anyone have a checkmate meme?
How do we know for sure that it's a chess move?
fuck, I can't wait to see the mind games he plays with her on this. 
oh you think this is stupid? why don't you move to the middle east, where they kill people for damaging the koran. oh that's different? please explain. 
Who would worry about putting cucks in prison and/or losing their citizenship? 

Answer: cucks
I'm beginning to think 9D chess is too easy for the PEOTUS.
It was declared to be unconstitutional because it was protected free speech.     But they could always make it a safety issue by banning fires during public protests.


fuck me how many dimensions can this man play on at once 
I still feel like I'm dreaming, ever since election day.  THIS IS AWESOME.
If Trump did this intentionally, it is probably the smartest thing he has ever done during his campaign+post election.
He knows whatever he says, liberals will do the opposite.  He says "don't burn the flag; burning the flag should be illegal" and he knows liberals will start burning flags.  Then we will have videos of them burning the flag.  We already know they love to fly the Mexican flag like they're a conquering invading force.
Can someone explain this to me? Is he for real or is this intergalactic chess? And if so, how/why? Thanks!
Instead of jailing flag burners (because the libtard cucks will burn more flags to challenge a based new law), give Americans THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN FLAG, AT ALL COSTS.  Cucks would not burn another flag, afraid of a legal beating from a proud American.
It may or may not be a chess move but I support it 100%.
Although no one seems to care, let's be clear that the bill introduced by Clinton and Bennett **DOES NOT OUTLAW** the burning of a person's own American flag for the purpose of political statement.
This is exactly how Hitler came into power don't you guys see??!!! 
I don't really care if it's another chess move, this should be illegal. 
I like the idea. If you burn our flag, you shouldn't be our citizen. 
I see nothing wrong with this. They should be punished. That shit just ain't right. 
Moths to a flame, flies to trash, cucks to shame, whores to cash.
Citizenship should be something you can lose if you are an immigrant. If you do not love America and it's people you shouldn't be in America. If you burn a flag or praise ISIS then you are no longer welcome in America. 

This has nothing to do with free speech, if you act as an enemy of the state then you will be treated as such. 

American values are more important to humanity than ten billion Muslim's. 
It's quite simple really.  How many people know of this?  It wouldn't strike my mind to go look for this.  They're a media organization of how many people?  And the conservative internet at large has many more than the 300k right here.  When they get mad at these hypocritical statements SOMEONE remembers.  Not just Pepperidge Farms.  And they have the whole internet of archived information at their disposal.  
#HE NEEDS TO STOP!

he is going to seriously hurt the libtards if he makes them think this hard
FALLING FOR THAT BAIT 
I love this "loss of citizenship" idea. Liberals will literally be tripping over each other to deport themselves.
Haha 
Un-fucking-believable. What did we do to deserve such a based President? 
Because they are desperate to find some tangible shred of evidence that he is LITERALLY HITLER!.  They don't take the time to check facts or history, and they continuously underestimate his ability to troll.
There is no rational reason that a person should not be allowed to burn their own property, American flag or not.
I don't understand, does Trump actually support this or is he just saying it to expose how retarded the left is?
They will simply react with outrage every time.  They are too willfully ignorant to do any actual research and are not accustom having their bullshit called.   They are nothing more than spoiled children.
THIS TIMELINE IS TOO MUCH, I MAY EXPLOOOOODE

I'm not sure this would to through, Texas v. Johnson said it was coolio


He is going to troll them for the next 4 years. It's starting to feel like Trump really understands how moronic the 24 hour news cycle is. They will literally report on anything. Even DJT using a fucking fork to eat chicken. Man, when I put gravy on the colonel, that shit is messy as fuck. I can't expect my POTUS to have that much gravy on his face.
"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." Thomas Jefferson

It was wrong when Hitlery proposed it and it's still wrong now.

Jason Miller defends the tweet:

http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/miller-cuomo-flag-burning-debate-cnntv/
How is this trolling the media? The campaign is over and he's not running against Hillary. What Hillary believes is totally irrelevant at this point.
He won the election. If he doesn't believe in it and it's just a "troll" or political move he shouldn't be tweeting it. If Trump campaigned as not being a politician than it would be fantastic for him to live up to that. 
Had a discussion with a lib about it today.  She was saying all these negative things about Trump and putting people in jail over flag burning. Pointed out Hilary proposed it in 2005. Her response "Hilary meant it differently than Trump,she had a meaning behind her proposal so it was ok". Asked what Hilary's meaning was...She says oh whatever your wrong and Trump's wrong and she walked away lol. Lib logic 
Hahaha, He is the Man! The mighty Trump! :)
The Supreme Courts ays the first amendment doesn't apply to cross burning if it is to intimidate or terrorize someone or a group. Can't we as citizens be protected from the flag burners for the same reasons with the same penalties? It intimidates(not really) me and terrorizes(infuriates actually) me and threatens my patriotic beliefs.
The left has gotten so used to shutting people down with "gotcha" comments that it doesn't know how to handle it when it doesn't work. Debating fell out of favor with just poking until your opponent says something that isn't PC. It became the only tool in the bag. And why wouldn't it? Calling someone a bad name worked so well for so long.

What Trump has done is mastered a form of political judo. The harder they try to strike, the more easily he redirects their attacks.
Didn't Hillary lose? Why is her opinion relevant at all any longer?
This is going to be the best four years ever.
I don't know whether flag burning is part of free speech or not, but it really irritates me when poeple accuse Trump of being some sort of authoritarian. LOOK AT THE TWO-FACED POLITICIANS WE'VE HAD IN(AT LEAST) THE PAST THREE ADMINSTRATIONS!  Poeple who slowly but surely erode our freedoms in backroom deals, in bills that are quickly and quietly passed while no one is paying attention, in propaganda that we don't realize is propaganda, in conflicts that are started and maintained for a private political agenda, in persecution of whistleblowers that conflicts with whistleblower protection laws, in secret courts that are effectively above the law!!!! These are the types of poeple who threaten our freedom and democracy. Give me Trump instead. Give me a guy who expresses himself openly and honestly, even in occasional bursts of strong patriotic indignation. In telling you things that you don't wanna hear but still need to know. That type of leader is good for liberty and democracy, not bad. For god's sake, give me Trump any day.
From that same Wikipedia entry:

>However, the bill's language was designed so as to **prohibit the desecration of a flag when the intent was found to be a threat to public safety**, the intention being that it would therefore not violate the First Amendment and not be declared  unconstitutional.

Emphasis added. 
And a Troll as president is good for people how?
It's the holiday season. Trump's Presidency will be the Gift that keeps on giving for the next EIGHT years.
Trying to get the media to take the bait. "DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO PREVENT THE FLAG BEING BURNED OMG WAT ABUT FREEDUM OF EXPRESSIN!"

Romney did what he needed to do at the time - the worst thing would have been to lose the Presidency AND control of Congress.  There were certainly doubts as to the outcome of this election - we NEEDED the Never -Trumpers   to ensure we didnt lose those that were on the fence in the Congressionals.  Just in case...

CNN is like the titanic. They think they are unsinkable, but they didn't see the iceberg coming that is Donald Trump.
MSM: "We can't possibly be wrong, let's double down on our narrative!"
CNN: Trump promises to tear down 1st amendment, starts growing Hitler moustache.  
A cup of coffee and a Trump shitpost to wake up to. I *really* could enjoy getting used to this.
The media think they have power over the presidents, but when they meet a man who can't be bought they fucking implode!
CNN is getting savaged!
CNN is part of the swamp that needs to be drained.
Just reading the old  r/redacted live election results thread and the thing that stood out was how everyone was genuinely terrified of a trump win. They are all infants, and CNN is their mom, and the #fakenews is their baby food. Here comes the aeroplane!

CNN this morning:  [Why Donald Trump won't change](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/donald-trump-transition-presidency/index.html).  Calls Trump "mercurial, sometimes thin-skinned, gregarious, truth-challenged, media taunting and unpredictable."

Bullshit. 

Query: If he's mercurial and unpredictable then how can your premise be that he won't change?
CNN in full panic mode, getting more rekt day by day. When will it stop? (Hint: never)
The thing that got me on the Trump Train very early in the Republican primaries was how he refused to back down and apologise when the media attacked him, but instead attacked back.  They were and are horrified by this, they are after all, *the media!!!*, *they* get to tell us what to think.
Now they've got the soon to be leader of the free world still calling them out on their lies and BS, and they don't know how to respond.

It's glorious.
Diary of President Trump:
- wake up at 5:00am
- grab cup of coffee
- take a sip
- shitpost MSM on Twitter

Fucking love this guy. 
Lol man I love seeing streams of endless triggered leftards in his twitter feed. He is going to trigger them for 8 years and it's exactly what they need.

U/spez: typo
I start to smile when I see he's launched another shitpost, grin as I read it, giggle as he lines them up and laugh like a motherfucker as they're BTFO.

The exclamation point at the end of them, that's  the cherry on top. It gets me every time!
God I'm jealous, you guys have the best president, I mean Putin is damn cool (ignore the lies msm have brainwashed you with about him - he has 80% approval rating here in Russia), but your president shitposts like a king!

I personally do not want to see a better CNN but a destroyed CNN. If they've behaved this way once they will certainly do it again. Deceptive disgraceful little shit company.
Instant sticky    

Spez: I really hope he dismantles the white house press corps like Cernovich says.    

Let only Alex Jones in, and then stream that shit on Twitch.
Can someone tell me why Trump tweeting is so "bad"? It's refreshing to have a political figure who's willing to communicate directly with the people instead of releasing "planned statements" on social media which the actual person isn't even in charge of.
Pull their press credentials and give them to Breitbart. 
There it is, the 3AM shit post.  Presidential as fuck.  
Im glad I became red pilled just in time for me to be on the right side to enjoy these shitposts/winning rather than being triggered 24/7 like the liberals. Also glad I was around to see CTR kick in and see censorship firsthand so I know for a fact that there is an agenda being pushed in the media and not a conspiracy theory
Someone help me out here. Every time I check a genuine President Elect Donald tweet there seems to be an army of people of all nationalities losing their shit voicing their "opinion" on what President Elect Donald should or should not be doing. Unlike the majority of these tweet respondents I can see past the fabulous hair do and radiant skin tone. 

I can only assume he knows the outcome will be salt but does it anyway. I thought you guys were messing when you claim he shit posts but by my own calculations he seems to be literally operating with NO BRAKES in this regard. Wew Lad.
So much truth! I can't take it!!

REEEEEEEEEE
Honestly though, now that Hillary lost, what the hell are CNN even expecting to get out of being biased at this point? The election is over, it's not like its going to change anything. All they're doing is starting needless hate and getting closer and closer to losing white house credentials. Is there any point to it anymore? 
CNN is FAKE NEWS
Revoke their white house press access.
Five out of thirteen of CNN's "Top Stories" are negative Trump stories. There are few entities with a larger voice than CNN.  The US Presidency is one of them. CNN should back off but they apparently can't help themselves. When the leader of the free world continues to bash them it will effect them negatively long term. And it will be fun to watch.
Early morning shade.


Gonna be a good day.
President Trump is forcing them to become a better version of themselves.
Let's support him and get #boycottCNN trending, that will scare CNN a little (as it should for being gross propaganda).
I for one, welcome our new shit posting president.
So happy he is hitting them..fuck cnn..fuck wolf blitzer
This man is too savage to contain. A shitposter in chief? Yes, please.
Why did I think this too? CNN is an arm of the Soros DNC. President Trump will teach them.
I think centipedes need to be in the Trump Tower to celebrate all our winings. We can't be tired, we get more #HIGH ENERGY!
He will destroy the crooked media in the next 4 years! 
This surprised me a lot actually. I don't expect much from the irresponsible msm, but I at least thought they would give the absurdity a rest.  

It's their funeral.
I was also wrong about this, I expected them to be better but for some reason they are defying the logical choice and making themselves seem like bitter idiots. 

People on both sides really hate CNN, I know a lot of Liberals as I used to be one, they think CNN is a joke as well and heavily biased to the point of seeming unhinged. 
[Let me blow your minds by showing you Don Lemon sticking up for journalistic integrity on CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdFzf36G4lI).

As laughable as it is for Don Lemon to be saying "I'm a journalist. We're supposed to tell the truth!", he's actually right here, and showed there is a very, very small part of him that refuses to be cucked.

He triggered everyone else on CNN and went against black organizations like the NAACP to stick up for free speech.

Hardly redeems him - and certainly doesn't redeem CNN, considering they tried to shame him and shut him up - but it was a pretty amusing, out of character moment for CNN.
I wake up early just for these Presidential Shitposts!
Fuck cnn
###Evan, Evan, Evan, Evan, hold on
Does this guy even SLEEP!? 
Member when anderson pooper thought he was so smug with his "set up" questions about women?  He knew full well they were about to trot out the swiftboat style accusers.  never forget.
CNN is still on the air ??

This is one of my favorite tweets! Trump is STILL trolling the media...I love it!
Well you know they failed when they hired Hipster McDouchebag Casey Neistat to help with their propaganda. Whats he gonna do now, shill harder for liberals and keep dicking around NYC on his motorized skateboard? Probably pimp CNN on his YouTube vlog
With 1 tweet he can get a rise out of so many people. DT is the man. 

Reading through the comments on twitter laughing my ass off at the angry commenters. 
Tell it like it is Mr. President. 
If reddit wasn't so blindly cucked, they'd love this guy calling out the media and the politicians. 
I wouldnt know what CNN is saying because they are banned in my house!  
Fake news didn't work so they tried porn. That didn't work so it looks like back to fake news
I'm glad Trump is going to shitpost even after winning
Absolute savage. Does this guy ever stop breaking balls?
Talked to my neighbour, he is on reddit, too. He is a total cuck and he totally freaked out about Trump being at the top of r/all with his tweets. I laughed so hard
Damm he has been really savage lately; love it.

Fuck CNN

Just do not allow them WH press credentials. That will end them as a news organization. CNN = #fakenews
Trump's just right off the cuff.  So honest but so true.
It's so very refreshing to have a President that just speaks their mind.
SJWs always double down.
Love him or hate him, CNN has become a pretty terrible network and that tweet is god damn hilarious. 
That's exactly what I'd expect a Russian Agent to say.
Something just really cracks me up when thinking about how Trump is going to sit in the Oval Office shitposting on Twitter, from January 20th onwards.
Yea the media's narrative is like Trump lost. They do nothing but accuse Trump and his supporters of some sort of supremacy, fascism and whatever other mean bully words they can come up with. 
CNN should have every license revoked and shut down.

**CNN = Gossip Column**
>3:34 AM

I love this man
This guy....   I love this guy.
he gets to shitpost while being president. fucking hell ROFL

I'd just like to say the next 4 years everyone is going to hold everyone accountable and I love it.
They have to double down on their terrible coverage to convince themselves and their six or seven viewers left that they were right all along. (they weren't)
The leftist media needs to be held accountable.
CNN is just assuming the bad guy role that Fox has been playing the last 8 years. 

Remember when Hulk Hogan started dressing in black and became the evil villain?  That's CNN now. 

It's a TV show guys. They don't care about journalism, politics or the people of America. None of the networks do. 

Their only goal is to attract viewers and sell commercial air time. They love the free advertising from Trump. 


I just love all of the crybaby babbling idiots who respond to Trump on Twitter as if he's going to actually read their comments, hahaha
Same could be said about /r/politics. CTR shills moved out and anti-Trump liberals moved in. In other words shills got replaced by Bernie idiots.. I mean bros.
They've literally sealed their fate. 
I don't get why people are getting their panties tied in a bunch when the president calls out a biased news organization? This is such a refreshing sight from the previous government paying off the media to hide the truth and correct the record.
Remember, you're not allowed to read this shitpost. CNN can, because they're media, but you can't. They'll tell you what he said.

Poor CNN. They want a good girl, but they need a bad pussy.
Please, Mr President! I'm tired of all this winning! 
I fucking love it
I actually can't see how the left can't see how they're being manipulated by the MSM. Sad. 
hahaha he just burned the entire media division of the DNC and their willing dupes on social media

Trump's press seating arrangements need to have CNN sitting behind Korean/Italian TV, in the same row as Guam or Mongolian TV
Exactly what I have been thinking. He couldn't be more right!
he is not wrong. 
CNN had been wrong for 18 months
I did not think it possible for a news network to out insane MSNBC, but it looks like CNN has done it.
Let's be honest cnn has been shit for the last 15 years.
What worries and tires me: Even after the inauguration they won't stop spewing bullshit. They will scream "Impeachment" for things they's have APPLAUDED Obama.
Madman! 
CNN is going to get a ratings boost with all this attention.
edgy XD
Btfo!
Revoke their credentials along with WAPO, NYT, MSNBC etc
Did they honestly think they could stump the Trump? They are nothing to Donald, but just another shill to make fun of. Trump will stump them with precision, the likes never before seen on this Earth. If only they had known the kind of retribution attempting to stump the Trump would bring down upon them, maybe they would have thought twice. But they couldn't, they didn't, and now they are paying the price. Foolish fake news merchants.

CNN BTFO

Hey /u/Electrical_Engineer_,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Same thing happened with Brexit. The Bremain 'propaganda' went paddle to the metal after the Brexit vote. They're not going to make this easy.
Sad!
Even if Trump accomplishes absolutely nothing else during his presidency (he will accomplish lots of things), the simple fact that he is systematically and single handedly destroying the MSM is a history book worthy accomplishment in and of itself.
It's like he says, "We do not merely destroy our enemies; we change them.‚Äù 
Amen, brother!
10 years ago I feel they weren't too bad. Shits changed.
We are the media now
The MADMAN is at it again.

Chris Cuomo doubling down on defending the American flag being burned, such an idiot.  Maybe he should film himself doing it that would be great for ratings the direction CNN is going.
mmm. early morning spice! sink that ship.
"We're the news!  They  have to believe us, right?"
Trump always says what we are already thinking. 
How long did it take CNN to correct themselves after reporting an active shooter at OSU?
Yea maybe they don't get as much funds from hillary anymore :(
So people are saying it's within their first amendment of "free speech" for burning the flag. Then saying burn confederate flag, to trigger intended crowd. All while praising Castro...wtf people are a bunch of a-holes

Clearly as you can see, these people do favors for each other. Give Hillary an endorsement, you app is purchased for $25 million!
CNN will always be recognized as a toddler shitshow.

In my lifetime, I can only think of one lefty on the national scene (Bill Clinton) that moderated after an electoral beating instead of doubling down.

I know we have some based lefties here - can you guys think of any others that qualify?

I honestly thought the media would stop with their destructive narratives once it became clear the lost and a honest decision would take place. I seen a few come out and be honest but most are doubling down and trying to galvanize resistance against trump. 
As someone who watched CNN religiously in the past, what pisses me off is how cavalier they are in their biased reporting. They don't even care that they are biased. They think the viewers are sheep and can't see through them. HEY CNN! People can tell when you put the spin on.

Disgusting racist sexist network. Why isn't Wolf Shitzer gone yet? 
Exactly how I feel about a certain super secret classified sub.
CNN loves race and gender wars. They were set up by the CIA back to spread first Iraqi war propaganda and still at it. 
Sucks that they changed their acronym to Crap News Network
I hope he revokes their Whitehouse access lol

These people have to be retarded or something. They were against him before he won, which is fine free speech and all that. But afterwards they are continuing to try and make enemies with the most powerful man in america? Seriously?
Just out of curiosity because I don't watch CNN, what have they been saying that he might have been referring to?
Eh mild, It's not even an insult, just an opinion. Was hoping for something more. I'l check back later after work :/

Don't disappoint us, you are the KING now.
Yeah I mean their coverage of the campus attack was horrific.  Headline pops up on my iPad: "active shooter on campus".  Whatever, CNN.
Is this in reference to a specific event?
They just haven't learned their lesson yet.  Doubling down on the rhetoric doesn't work anymore.  The masses are being red pilled in droves now.

Tbh I don't think a (future) president should be telling everyone what they think of a certain company, unless the company has done something that's really bad (not just "getting worse"). The president should be focusing on politics, the economy etc. not on what he likes and doesn't like. Well, maybe it's just because I'm not American.

When ever i watch I come to the conclusion they fired any decent reporter to ensure they got majorly bias coverage of the election and now they are stuck with all their reporters only knowing how to cover an election so they are just pretending the election is still going and fuck all other news.

They are worse.
Is someone triggered?
You would think he has more important things to do besides tweeting about a news network 
would get better after failed so badly in their support of Hillary clinton however

I'm racist, sexist angry bastard and not even 'murican. But I'm fucking sick of the amount of this spam in /all
Trump should just shut down all the fake news networks and open his own news channel. This way people will get the truth every time and only need one news source for all of their learnings.

Very interesting!
While she hasn't been scrubbed *completely* (mentions in other bios, other articles, and such), [she does not have a link to a bio page](http://www.gp.org/2016_candidates), her photo is no longer on the front page, and is [not listed in their database for election year 2016](https://secure.gpus.org/secure/testdb/).
This is actually crazy to watch, ya know. History's gonna laugh... I'm so embarrassed (get it together US peeps!)
Imagine raising funds for useful green agendas like replacing Flint MI water lines.  Nope. A stupid recount.

Well at least she got out of this with more than a $600,000 house, she made $6.5 million.  Trump should hire her, she is obviously very entrepreneurial.
Can it get any better?
Make like a tree
She should've stayed in that band of hers. It wasn't very good, but at least she didn't embarrass her self in it.
She took the money and ran. Bernie taught her TOO well.

I hope he reads us the story about the Vicious Snake. Nothing better than Daddy Trump reading us a good bed time story.
The liberal tears are gonna be epic.
First stop, my city! This is great
What a great time for Soros sponsored protests. We need to get out in front of this and expose it.   
  
Which website do they use to organize these protests? Is it MoveOn or somethi else?   
  
If they are placing craigslist ads to hire protestors, do we have a list of cities and dates yet?  
   
One thing we never did (AFAIK) is infiltrate these organized, paid protests, and try to expose them as they happened. Can you imagine what we could do by letting this sub know the protest meetup locations ahead of time? Photographing the organizers, getting video of them instructing protestors how to act? Identifying / photographing agents in the group trying to incite violence?   
  
What if 1/4-1/2 of the paid/organized protestors were us?

Sometimes I remember that I'm not American and not really part of this movement :(
oh fuck. I just got done with having withdraws from the rallies... now there back!fuck it I don't care if I never come down
Hmmm.  I love the idea of a victory tour, but not a fan of the security risk.
Fuck I hope he comes to Wisconsin. Was pissed I missed the last one. 
I'm suffering through Trump Rally Withdrawls I need a new one now!
I live in Hamilton county, and we went blue. We don't deserve this, but we need this!!
I am so afraid he's going to get shot!
honestly i would like him to not expose himself to any public acts. i don't think the has been a time where the media has lead millions to almost murderous hatred of trump. sadly it only takes 1 : (
I hope he comes back to Arizona, we've treated him well and he's treated us well. Plus, I'd love to have him sign my copy of TAofTD. 
While I like the idea... does this not seem unsafe? Last thing we need is our president to not make it to office after all the effort to get him there. 
The Trump rallies were probably my favorite part of the campaign.
If the media doesn't bend, and continues to work towards a Trump failure, I imagine continuing the rallies *(perhaps sometimes just Ivanka, or sons)* could be a potent connection to the American public that will allow him to communicate without touching the infectious cesspool of modern Western journalism.

For a foreigner like myself this is one of the most interesting cases- how will Trump act alongside / against this globalist media? A lot of things are different between the Alt Right (America) and New Right (Europe), but the media system opposing these two factions is identical. 
I am so glad to hear this.  I LOVED his rallies.  I think he did too.  Let's get the country fired up and MAGA!!
For his own safety, maybe he shouldn't be out in the public with these rabid dogs roaming around 
Everyone needs to contact the Trump team with intense requests that they **enact the best security measures ever seen before in history** to protect the President-Elect during these rallies.

Despite how Trump would probably not like the appearance it would give, he should have a large, transparent bulletproof (even bombproof) shell around him on stage.


I kind of want Trump to just sit in a maximum security room until he's inaugurated and successfully drains the swamp. God bless you secret service, we need you guys more than ever
Holy shiet.

Waaa I want to work less for more money.


I've been dealing with $10 minimum wage for a year, and I'm in school attempting to get a degree. Maybe try that. 
anybody with any common sense saw this coming from 10000 miles away when this shit happened. 
As a programmer, I think this is a great trend.

Self driving cars, self service kiosks, factory automation, online customer service chat bots, online schools where one teacher can teach 1 million students. 

AUTOMATION IS GOING TO ELIMINATE YOUR JOB UNLESS YOUR JOB IS AUTOMATION.


Good job liberals, you win this round and thousands of people are losing. Suck on them, huh?

You economic illiterate ass.
The very definition of *irony*.
My city passed this shit. Businesses already cutting staff.
Oops.
Arizonan here.

Idiots just passed a $12 minimum wage law.  Up from $8.15.  I make $11 an hour.

Everyone in my office, also making $11 an hour, is rejoicing.

Even though I've told them time and time again, this is only going to cost those at the lowest rung of the ladder their jobs.

That money has to come from somewhere.  And our companies aren't going to cut into their profits to do it.

Fuckers...
I do not have the link, but saw where someone asked Trump if robots were slated to take over some manufacturing jobs

His response: Yes, and we will make those, too

# Winning
One of the first things they teach you in economics class: higher minimum wage = less jobs available      

Employers don't just conjure the increased salaries out of the Nether, they have to make up for the difference by hiring less people.     

Buuuut again hearing "We'll increase your wages!" makes unsuspecting voters giddy and they fall for it.
Can we get a robot that counts the items in the bag so we can all stop getting home to realize we're missing a McDouble :(
Once again, Liberals screw up and will blame the patriarchy. 
I for one welcome our new robot overlords
If you're making $7.50 an hour, chances are you are either a kid, or you're a massive loser. Nobody with any get up and go at all is making minimum wage.
Eh, those things were coming anyway.

Minimum pay for minimum skills...
I love those things, I can stand there browsing the value menu and promo deals all I want trying to get the best possible deal without some greasy teenagers watching me with that "did you figure your fucking order out yet?" face.

Look forward to taco bell getting this, you can get the premium menu items super cheap by messing with the options a lot, which is considered a dick move to do in person, but nobody cares with electronic ordering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okKIBTcU2Ug
And before you know it, the drive thru speaker will connect to a call center in the Philippines. 
At least those kiosks will be built in the USA or face high tariff taxes to import them in. At least we have that going for us.
WE WILL BUILD THE ROBOTS HERE.

15$ aint shit. 

Stop whatever your doing right now.

Under Trump we will all make much more than 15$ an hour..

#15$ an hour is not SHIT
They've already introduced self serve kiosks at some of the newer Panera Bread restaurants. They still have a cashier. 1. And about 7 ordering kiosks. Movie theaters are doing the same thing. $15/hour for cashiering jobs is going to lead to job loss for those folks. 
This is good. We don't need to pay people to do repetitive tasks a basic robot can do more effectively. We need better education so our people can do more, like program robots.
saw this coming from a mile away.


at its absolute best, raising the minimum wage will simply be followed with a rise in prices. see: san Francisco(though, admittedly, i inly no about SF from a friend from there)

It was going to happen eventually, this just sped it along. Can't blame it on the dems.

The Catholic church has a long history of sheltering pedophile priests and I bet they don't pay taxes.

I don't know the specifics of Scientology, but to single it out as the only crazy religion seems very biased.

Mock Muslims and see what happens.

He probably was a repressed homotransexual dragonkin who, on an unrelated note, suffered from bipolar schizophrenia.

What this really boils down to is the fact that there are too many guns, and they all need to go away, pronto. Guns made him do this. Whispered in his ear to get a knife, then drive into a group of people and get his stabby-stabby on.

Facts are facts, you know. Guns are bad influences and lead to violence and illicit drugs. I mean, maybe you don't know this because you're just not informed, but your local library has a larger collection of guns than it does books--Obama said so, and he's a fucking saint, so don't question him.

Now before you go and dispute any of my claims, I want to make something clear: You're either a white, cismale and your opinion doesn't matter because patriarchy, or your an uncle Tom apologist who does things against your own interests. Your input is void.

Wew. All this typing has got me hungry. I'm just going to get up and. Oh. Oh, shit. My fucking tendies are all over the floor now. Great job, OP. You wasted my time and my mid-morning meal.
Someone should Photoshop a bacon wrapped penis in his mouth. 
He got what he deserved.

The only good terrorist is a dead terrorist.

#THE OFFICER DESERVES RECOGNITION. THIS SHITSTAIN ISLAMIC MOTHERFUCKER DESERVES TO BE FORGOTTEN BUT IN NAME ONLY PLEASE.
This balding man was only "18-20 years old' according to documents. I have ever seen such a old looking 18 year old.


He was going bald at 18... His actions now make sense /s
Guys, dont make this piece of shit famous. Make the victims famous. Spread his picture and telling his story is a win for him. Fuck this terrorist.

Shit guys if that's a terrorist I think I need to report my left nut to the fbi
He is the innocent victim in an over aggressive SWAT operation.
Dude literally looks like he's plotting how to murder a bunch of "infidels" in this picture 
If I was balding at age 20 I would be upset too. 

if we really look at this, and I mean really look at it...it's white peoples fault 
Are we sure he wasn't a Buddhist?
Personally not a fan of showing name and face of people who do these attacks, don't give crazies the idea they'll get 15 minutes of fame for killing innocents.
From the nose down he looks like Kanye...
#religion of piss
Fuck this guy. In very few instances does someone deserve to be treated poorly, or die -- this guy hit them all.

FAKE NEWS CLAIMS HIS MOTIVATIONS MAY NEVER BE DISCOVERED
He has *inferiority complex* written on his face. His lips are pursed so hard here. Classic sign of repressed anger. I think it's applicable here since he knows he's being photographed and cannot or will not relax.
Liberals saw the news ***Attack at OSU*** 

-please be James McLaren with an M16

Great summary patriot! How would you summarize this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_kKkY5EpVpY
He also said Islam isn't how the media portrays it a few months before committing the attack lmao
We may never know his motives
Religion of peace 
But I was told it was a white guy from Baton Rouge!
Can anyone prove he did it for Islam?

If anything I interpret his statements against *interventionalism*.
Yet they want us to double-down on Muslim shithole immigration by bringing Syrians over.

I say this sincerely, as someone who lives amidst the largest Somali population in the USA - **Fuck off** with that shit. Just this month we tossed a half dozen in prison for 10+ years for trying to join ISIS and the local media did sob stories about it as if we're the bad guys for catching and arresting them. 

Do the fucking math - now tax payers have to house these vermin for over a decade. It's millions of dollars, and that's the "fringe costs" associated with Somali immigration. Don't get me started on the legitimate "everyday" costs. Half the fucks driving around this city have a nicer govt.-issued vehicle than I can afford with my own money.

It'll only get worse.
Sent back to hell
It would be interesting if his autopsy could corroborate his age of 18. Looks a bit older to me; which would then questions the veracity of everyone who identified him as 18. Too late to vet after the fact. 
Holy fuck, this guy has a freaking HUGE dome.
Man, Poot hadn't been doing well since he got out the game. 
HOLD UP HOLD UP ..WAAAIT WAIT.. CUT HIS MIC, I SAID CUT HIS MIC. Those claims are baseless, this network never endorsed that. You need to tone down that racist retorihc. Islam is a peaceful and loving religion of death and oppression, get your facts straight and look at the real victim here #voiceofdumlemon

It was just a cry for help, guys.
I don't think we should be sharing images or this shit head's name

Lets just call him the pig fucker or something
What he did was evil. What I would like to point out is that he was only 18 years old. We need to make a priority of exposing the identities of the sick and twisted radical Islamist terrorists who are indoctrinating these young people and turning them into sacrificial killers. Then we need to deal with them. 
That ain't no brother he's a piece of trash
[removed]
There is actually no evidence to suggest that he did it in the name of Islam.
That's a pretty good picture. He looks tired and exhausted: from doing the thousands of hours of work Obama forgot. 
I wouldn't put it past that cuck to replace all references to Trump as president with Hillary.


Tremendous person right there
Freaking KEK
Arnold is a cuck who spoke out against trump tho. Tell him to go back to the dem party 
Look up his '04 GOP convention speech. He boldly claimed it was Nixon.
Arnie was always a loser. Knocked up his maid too. What a loser. 

Still a loser. 
Anyone else read that in a teminator 2 voice. 
Great. Now I know this fuckers name and face. He has a standing challenge to a fist fight from me. 
Wow... Never ceases to amaze me...
The tweet isn't there, it says 1 tweet but zero tweets show up. Did you make an archive link? Might want to try that over a screenshot next time, since it's harder to fake.
As a resident of that state, he can eat my short dick. 
It is garbage like this these "progressives" spew that red pilled me since the primaries.
"hahaha i just love terrorism so much"
He's just... *misguided*. Surely no leftist would have any true hatred in their hearts.
Violence begets violence. 
Today's episode of The Tolerant Left was brought to you by: I REALLY DON'T CARE IF MY RHETORIC COULD POTENTIALLY FUEL ANOTHER CIVIL WAR
It blows my mind how anyone could actually wish such horrors on anyone. Especially like this. This is not funny. These innocent people are losing everything. I wouldn't wish this on my ex and his family! It's just devastating! 

These people are very sick. 
What a piece of garbage. Really need to start naming our enemy though. Communist/Marxist left is what they are. "Liberal", yeah right. 
Where or how do you find these people? I get pissed at libs, but I don't wish them ill. I would like for them to wake up... or move to Canada.
One thing that I love about Trump is that he has caused the Left to reveal their true colors in a way that they haven't before.

He brings out all of their hypocrisy and double standards into the light of day.

These Leftists are nasty, folks. Not "tolerant" at all! Only "inclusive" of those who agree with them. It's scary.
The tolerant left. 

Know your enemy. 
who would laugh at someone's home burning down? this is very wrong!
He even has a cuck name from OZ. Hey cuck I remember your face and if I ever find you .....well your going to  wish you were dead when im done.

**NO CHILL CHURCHILL**
How did the UK go from Churchill to Theresa...

Politics and money must be kept separate if politics is ever to be kept in check by a nation's people.
His full quote is worthwhile:

"How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity.

The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property‚Äîeither as a child, a wife, or a concubine‚Äîmust delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen: all know how to die. But the influence of the religion paralyzes the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science‚Äîthe science against which it had vainly struggled‚Äîthe civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome."

Are you saying statistics are biased now? That link does nothing but list legitimate statistics on Muslim opinions around the world.

While only a very small fraction of Muslims actually go on to commit terrorist acts, a significant percentage of the Muslim population have favourable attitudes towards terrorism, violence in defence of Islam, Sharia, and oppression of women, homosexuals, and basic human rights. Even the "moderate" Muslims are still vastly socially backwards compared everyone else in a secular, liberal democracy.

The religion of Islam itself is corrupt. The very core scriptures (Quran + Six Sunni Hadiths) contain:

Death for apostasy:

* Qur'an (4:89) - *"They wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve, and then you would be equal; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them, until they emigrate in the way of God; then, if they turn their backs, take them, and slay them wherever you find them; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper."*
 
* Bukhari (52:260) - *"...The Prophet said, 'If somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him.' "*

Death for homosexuality

* Qur'an (7:80-84) - *"...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)"*

Death by stoning for sex outside marriage (if you are or ever were married)

* Bukhari (6:60:79)- Muhammad orders two people guilty of "illegal" intercourse stoned to death. 

Death to _anyone_ who insults Muhammad in any country, whether or not he was ever Muslim.

* Qur'an (33:61) - *"Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain with a (fierce) slaughter."*

* Bukhari (59:369) - This recounts the murder of Ka'b bin al-Ashraf, a Jewish poet who wrote verses about Muslims that Muhammad found insulting. He asked his followers, 'Who will rid me of this man?' and several volunteered.  al-Ashraf was stabbed to death while fighting for his life. 

The "right" of a husband to beat his wife.

* Qur'an (4:34) - *"Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great."*

The "right" of a husband to have sex with his wife whenever.

* Qur'an (2:223) - *"Your wives are as a tilth unto you; so approach your tilth when or how ye will."*

A completely sexist divorce law where men can instantly divorce and women can barely do it at all.

* Muslim (9:3493) - Muhammad practices the triple talaq and approved of his followers doing the same.

Degrading women and treating them as only 50% of a man.

* Qur'an (4:11) - (Inheritance) *"The male shall have the equal of the portion of two females"*

* Qur'an (2:282) - (Court testimony) *"And call to witness, from among your men, two witnesses. And if two men be not found then a man and two women."*

And so on... this is not an extremist interpretation of Islam, this is what _every_ "educated" (in Islamic texts) Sunni Muslim will believe, because it's the commandments that Muhammad wrote in the Qur'an/Hadith.
Churchill told the people "Put ev'ry ship a-sail
'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismarck to the bottom of the sea"
I think I like your title better than Churchill's quote
I think that many of the Muslims are scared of the terrorists, too. . .  Just look at Syria as a perfect example of how they kill their own. . . 
North Africa used to be a based place with beautiful women due to centuries of Greek and Roman Enlightenment, Until it was brutally dominated by Islamic Conquest of rape and murder.

they are expecting another lone wolf victim of islamic terror terrorist to attack them? 

When has this ever happened?  Making stuff up, MsM is #FakeNews
I honestly love how crappy these are drawn. Makes them far funnier, and I've gotten spoiled on the masterpieces Ben Garrison seems to have a never ending supply of. These simple and ugly MS Paint drawings are effective and hilarious. Keep them coming. 
Why can you ms paint a SJW and make it look so realistic
Well, that shit happens in EU from time to time. So you actually should expect it to happen everywhere where there are a lot of fresh refugees from Middle East.  
Radical islamists have a really easy task of hiding between wemen and children because a lot of refugees have no papers whatsoever. Moreover, radical preachers are always trying to convert desperate believers to their dark ways. Sometimes it works unexpectedly well even for naturalised Europeans (Sad!). So how you can distinguish who is a security threat and who is a person in need?  
I believe that national agencies are doing whatever they can 24/7/365, but sometimes it is just not enough and then these things hapen.     
Please... Just make them disappear. All these leftists who simply shit into their own nest and then complain why all problems won't simply dissolve in thin air.... It makes me mad.
Poor terrorists! Being subjected to logical assessment and factually accurate statements.
I try to be as calm and as rational as I can be with people, but when they start claiming that Pence wants forced gay conversion therapy (false) and they call me a "self-hating asshole"...it's hard to stay that way.
LMAO the lack of a bra makes this so much more accurately hilarious.
How could you not "expect it" there has been more terrorist attacks this year than actual full 24 hour days. 
That's one ugly dude.
Isn't "SJW logic" an oxymoron?

we need to have a sjw mspaint contest on this subreddit, mods make it happen!
Nobody "expected" it to happen.  It was inevitable.  It was "going to" happen.
anybody got an album of all the pics like this
Also thinking of every ineffective way they can defend themselves in a school shooting except campus concealed carry. 
Realists expected it to happen. FTFY
FUCK! ...some people are awesome in MS Paint
look man there aint nothing wrong with a little bit of american grown green where the taxes made from it go to education for our children

but yeah god fuckin sjw's try to play any card and angle they can think of
Not all stoners are libs, please don't associate the two lol
The real victims here are the peaceful Muslims (which is all of them) because they're sure to be victimized by fucking white males after this. 
Logic? SJWs don't use logic. Logic is a tool used by the white patriarchy to keep women down.
I hate these hypocrites with every fibre of my being.

Not even joking... Two girls start talking about Ohio shooter... Talk about humans of Ohio state article (I'm thinking wow they are woke)... Then they do a 180 and say it is literally "trumps America" and islamophobia that caused him to be a terrorist....
Yeah I'm convinced any bad shit just blame liberals.  That way I feel better about myself yayayayayayaya

CNN's new bitch.


Who?
Neistat is a special kind of POS. He put out a video right before the election trashing Trump and then now he's suppose to be working with CNN on a new crowd funded platform regarding news? HAHAHAHAHA
Looks like a god damn goblin.
Sean Penn is looking awful lately. 
Only ever watched 2 of his videos...the one where he endorsed HRC and the one where he announced he was ending his vlog.  Both were stupid as fk, but what's REALLY disingenuous is that in the latter he never mentioned that he was in negotiations with CNN to sell his company or anything to that effect.  He made it sound like it was about the vlogs becoming too routine and not enough of a challenge.  Guy is a complete and total sellout fraud who was anything but honest with his fans.
He is not a sellout. He has always been a shill. Fucking caveman.
I'm not sure what I am looking at. 
He is so weird looking.
LET'S FORM A KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN TO BUY THIS POOR DEFORMED CHILD AN UPPER LIP
Triggered so hard, he ended his daily vlog. His editing and videos for doing random shit in NYC were somewhat interesting. Why the hell do celebs and youtube idiots ruin what they do by making everything political? Even fucking football is full of politics now. Sad!
thats the weirdest looking human being ive ever seen. serious question, is something physicallu wrong with him?
What happened to his face? Is it supposed to be like that? I dont think it's supposed to look like that.

What's with the creepy Polaroids?
##**HE HAS ONE OF THE MOST PUNCHABLE FACES I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE**
It is sad for me to watch him go full cuck mode because I've been watching him for a long time now and enjoy his short films but he totally went total cuck mode RIP :(
Sellout cuck
I'd say "punchable face" but it looks like he's already had one too many.
"Hillary Clinton, I will be voting for hillary clinton"- end nasally squidward voice.


What exactly does this weird human being do? Post videos on YouTube? Seriously, what's his occupation? 
Casey Neistat has always just been some rich, hip, New Yorker who posts videos about how rich and hip he is. I don't think it's fair to call him a sellout, there was no part of his being that wasn't already sold. He's not really worth caring about other than the fact that he tried to bandwagon the teenagers who watch him into somehow voting for HRC.
Isn't he also sponsored by Samsung? 

Always has the newest Samsung phone/tech in his videos next to an old Apple.
Serious...  Is his face shopped? 
Oh cool, the sloth from Ice Age
JFC ~~what~~ who is that?
He has the biggest face I've ever seen on the tiniest head. 
What the fuck is wrong with him? Creepy AF looking!!!
I immediately unsubbed from him as soon as I heard the words "I'm voting for Hillary". Such a cuck.
#SCIENCE CANNOT TELL ME THIS GUY IS 100% HUMAN


Is that Earthworm Jim?
I'm 100% a trump supporter and I definitely dislike the MSM. Especially CNN. But for 25 mil I would have done the same thing 
He commented on a youtube and I commented into the thread "MAGA Trump 2016" was ignored. (prior to election) went back after and said the same basically and was ignored again lol. But I know I smelt something salty
He looks like Quasimodo from Disney's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame".
What an unfortunate looking man. 
Goddamn I don't know who that is, but with that face he should be the fucking poster child of cucks.
He needs to be #1 for Meth Mouth as well.
"I will be voting for Hillar-"

I've never seen this man before. I've never heard of him. Now, thanks to a quick scroll, I know he's a Youtuber. For thirty seconds I knew him and now I never have to think about him again. Awesome. 
I don't know who this is but what the fuck is wrong with his face?  
He sold his shit to the Clinton News Network lol 
is that an alien from one of the Men in Black movies?
Who is this ugly turd?
He is not cuck. Beta pussy! Never liked him. After endorsing Clinton could not stand him anymore. 
Fetal alcohol syndrome?
And he quit doing vlogs shortly after.. Hillary really ruins everything she touches lol, that "who I'm voting for" video really created an anti-casey following, a lot of big youtubers spoke openly against him and the vid he made 

I think he left cause he kinda felt like he burned his bridge there, and he's probably right.
this cuck claims to be 35...LOL

Sweet Jesus, he maybe the fugliest man alive.
I loved watching his videos until he came out with that one. This pissed me off, people have the right to vote for whoever the fuck they want. It's actually pretty sad that all the entertainment sources that I loved watching on and off YouTube don't only dislike Trump but are anti Trump. The talk so much shit on a man who is going to be leading the country. It's hard to watch.

The most punchable face in history
I used to watch his old videos, I used to really admire the work he put in way before he started vlogging. You have to admire the fact that he literally came from nothing and built up everything he has now by putting in the work (albeit with a bit of luck and the right timing).

BUT once has started vlogging I felt like he became a corporate media machine and stopped being creative. Once he put out the video bashing Trump that was the final straw for me, now that he sold himself out to CNN it all makes sense now.

One ugly dude!
Who cares about him?
If Spez and Sean Penn mixed DNA: 
The missing Fine Bro.
He has the face of a fetal pig. 
Weird, he bashed Trump before the election and now works for the Clinton News Network.
He looks like Robbaz's character that he created in Fallout 4.
That's not mark Cuban! 
[Oh my God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62UzLgdb1GQ)
He didn't even graduate high school smh
Hmm I know it may be far fetched and hard to believe but I wonder if that's why H3H3 made a video about voting for Hillary, I just really find it hard to believe that Ethan is dumb enough to actually support her 
Shouldn't Mark Cuban be #1?
really not trying to be mean, but what a strange looking person he is. 
It's too bad. I actually enjoyed a few of his videos and other than politics, he did a great job with his vlogs around NY. Editing was satisfying. Now he's just another cuck.. 
How long is Lord of the Rings leasing him out for?
Well someone has been Spirit Cooking one to many times
This guy has to have a lisp.
Sells a failing app to the Cuck News Network, sad! Pick up that frying pan you were beat with as a youth and take one more swing at your head to see if you can knock some of the cuck out of there, Casey! Pathetic!
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome doesn't just make you ugly, it also makes you stupid apparently.
What did he do? I quite enjoy his vlogs (shamefully)
Tried watching one of his videos to see what all of the hype was about.

Lame sharper image salesman.
Looks like a retarded ewok why the fuck is this guy relevant
Looks like someone spliced Sean Penn with Quentin Tarantino, and beat it senseless.
Fuckin dick

Watch Pewdiepie (newest videos aren't that cringey) or H3H3 Prod. for a non-partisan channel that produces actual comedy.
Did someone slap him with a Muppet stick?
Well there's your problem, you should have googled "smeagol" or "gollum".
So CNN is hiring someone people already don't like... who the fuck works at CNN.
Who the fuck is this?
Honey, I shrunk my face! 

Coming to theatres January 2017
This is why we don't inbreed
Is that the thing from the goonies chained in the basement? Or is that the fucked up thing from pulp fiction that came out of the chest in bondage wear? I know it has to be one of them

What do oompa loompas have to do with cnn? 
that face just looks.... unique. 
Who the fuck over the age of 12 watches videos of "youtube celebs"?
i don't know what he does but he probably should just kill himself looking like that, never gonna make it.
So sad. Of course Clinton News Network gobbles him up. He has always said how he his brand is "transparent" and "real". Well going to CNN could not be more polar opposite to your brand. CUCK-A-DOODLE-DO.
#I don't want to catch him in bed with the goblins 
I hate him so much
Used to like him. His videos were pretty dope. But then this moron went to politics. Big mistake. 
i have no idea what that thing is...kill it with fire.
Isn't this the guy from the male rape video?
What is that thing? I sort of know, but still.
Who is that?
whats wrong with his face
God, that's one ugly dude. Who is he?
Are those photos of people who tried to take his precious? 
stupid "entrepreneur" making a stupid app by throwing money at it. You know it's trash if CNN buys it.
Hillary clit 
I'm voting for Hillary clit 
What's with his face? He looks like a terminal cancer patient.
FUCK I HATE THIS GUY! DAMN GOBLIN! 
Why does he look like he's constantly squinting?
He needs to be on punchable faces at the top
Who is this unfortunate looking fellow?
WTF is wrong with him?

He looks like he fell out of the Ugly tree, hit every Ugly branch on the way down, landed on his face, then rolled into the Ugly creek.
Ain't that a nice punchable face. Why do all cucks lookalike?
That doesn't look like Bernie 
Cmon guys, liberals and sellouts are bad enough. Their actions, morals, and convoluted way of thinking give us more than enough to shit on, and we are better than insulting someone on the way they look. 
I am guessing someone photoshoped his face.. this isnt real right?
Looks like sloth from the Goonies had a love child

#MASSIVE CUCK
Goblin Casey
Thats the douche who make Drone videos. He's such a douche.. Why is he on this sub though? someone explain plz.
I don't know who this cuck is but seeing the shitty genetic hand this numpty was dealt has boosted my own self esteem. For that, cuck, I thank you.
there but for the grace of Darwin go my genetics
I knew I'd seen him somewhere before

Wtf is that?
I love how quickly the world is changing, the liberal community has been absolutely devastated by this election, maybe irreparably.
Neistat face looks it like got BTFO'd by a hammer. 
Is it just me or does this guy have the most punchable face of all time?
Thought that was a picture of Ben Shapiro, honestly.
Dude looks like he's from Garry's mod
Who's the guy with the giant beak?

r/hittablefaces
What the fuck is with his mouth? Is it like that all the time?
What the fuck is that?
The only reason I know who this dip shit is. 

In September 2016 my recommended videos section on YouTube began to fill up with his videos out of nowhere. 

I had no idea who the hell he was, and I never searched for videos pertaining to his subject matter. 

I watched a couple of his vids and quickly understood that this cuck was un-entertaining, and that he was a bought out useful idiot, for the  neo-communist agenda. 

Fuck you YouTube for deciding I would benefit from his bought and paid for opinions. Cucks!

He's going to fit right in at CNN
Who the fuck is that
What is wrong with his face? I don't even know who he is
Looks like a toothless crack head

im really out of the loop here...who is this pleb?
Fuck Casey Neistat and his POS snapchat wannabe app.
Sell out he was never in he was always a tard
His face scares me more than Tim Kaine a.k.a the grinch
who us this demented imp 
He looks like the kind of guy who has to go door to door and notify his neighbors every time he moves into a new place. 
Even though he shilled for her. after she lost he didn't whine a bit. he accepted the result.
This dude is funded by Saudi money. I'm not kidding or joking. 
He looks like a junkie
Can someone please find him on the streets of NY and blast his face? Please please please? Thanks.
Okay - I'll preface this by saying I really can't stand the dude as a vlogger.  He comes off as a total douche in the few videos I've seen.

However, people hating on him for "selling out" are fucking stupid.  He is a business owner, businesses are bought and sold all the time.  Okay, he didn't tell his viewers he was in talks with CNN when he mentioned he was quitting the vlog.  You never talk about a deal in public or on social media before it's finished, that can seriously shift the balance of power in the negotiation and makes the leaker look bad.  His fans act like he was doing the vlogs as some sort of charity for their entertainment - grow the fuck up.  He is coin operated just like any successful person, that's not selling out it's having good business sense.
I disagree with Casey on HC and CNN but I like the guy and he is great at what he does
Can you guys stop ruining this guy's life? He has done nothing but good things and he doesn't deserve this. This subreddit is about Donald Trump, not ruining other people's lives.
he is a jew. what do you expect?
Flynn being a big fan of milo makes me like Flynn a lot better.  It's just keeps getting better as we go.  Milo is the man. He is more of a man than any liberal, and he's gay.
How can anyone not like Milo?  He is very well-spoken.
FREE MILO
Common sense escapes the left or should I say alt-left?! Keep your ears and eyes open. 
Please Milo for Press Sec. Please Please Please
That's pretty based.
NY Post, one of the 2 papers that endorsed Trump. Coincidence? I don't think so.
It was a peaceful stabbing!!!111!!!!
Not weak? The Second Amendment disagrees.

Refugees (if they're even allowed into the country at all) should only be provided with minimal housing, sanitation, medication and meals. A university education is not something that they NEED.
I know someone who's daughter was in the area.  Yesterday totally sucked.  Each time these things happen more people open their eyes.  However it should t happen in the first place.
I bet libertards will advocate that terrorist was just very upset with Trump. So the solution is to stop Trump instead of terrorism.  
You know same stuff when BBC pushed a report on a "Syrian rebel" who ripped a heart from a dead Assad's soldier and then ate it on a camera. Happens that poor guy just was very upset! 
BASED NEW YORK POST

EDIT: just saw the "edit" button is now labeled "spez" ... 
my sides>>>orbit
#**NEW YORK POST >>> NEW YORK TIMES**
"We are not weak"

Take knife to gun fight
Snopes: "Ackchyually... he hit them with the car and didn't actually run people over" 

MOSTLY FALSE

Politifact: "The incident was over in a few minutes, so there was no time for the entire Campus to be gripped by terror" 

PANTS ON FIRE



NY Post didn't let feelings get in the way of reporting on this one. Bully!
I can just imagine what the NYT and WaPo headlines are
He only stabbed them because he didn't have a safe space. Smh look at the real issue people 
Does this kind of thing even scare people anymore? It just makes me angry.
I love how every single one of my liberal friends, who speak up within the hour of gun violence every time, have been silence for over 24 hours. Pure silence on this crime.

It makes one thing very apparent: They do not care about victims of violent crime, they care about advancing political agendas.
I'm glad he's the only one who died. 
Fucking straight. I wish we had those Harry Potter pictures so we could show the dude getting smoked.
No narrative here, just the facts.
Oh look!  Real news!
If this was the Berlin Post, the editors would all be in jail, yet we are the fascists.
Look, they are reporting the facts of what ACTUALLY happened!  No "analysis" or fact-twisting.  Just reporting...**the news**.
I bought a New York Post on eBay for Trump's win. Going to have it framed along with my other campaign memorabilia. 
Based New York Post. Telling it like it is...
And no way Abdul is 18, he's half bald with mustache and looks 25-30 years old.
This is the tipping point. Every muslim can fuck right off until they learn to behave like humans. Fuck these murderous pigs.
Remember guys! The real victims here are other Muslims who will be victimised. Not the people who die screaming from their acts of terror. 


For the longest time I would confuse The New York Post with the (failing) New York Times... not anymore! 
I don't get it, what's so based about this?  Isn't that exactly what happened??
MAGA
"We are not weak..."

And you think "we" are? I'm not religious, but if they keep trying to call out all of Christianity they're forgetting that the Orthodox world is much closer to them. I mean damn, I know Serbia is just sitting on "Go" right now with all the refugees around them and you definitely don't want to piss them off.
New York post has been based as fuck forever.
DIN DO NUFFIN
WEW 
This should have been the headline on all papers. Good job doing actual reporting, NY Post!
he was mad cause he was going bald at 18
Meanwhile, at NYT the topic was about a car accident which took place, and said nothing about him slashing people with a machete.
The Post is just about the only non-fake news media company left in NYC.
My first thought was "damn, that's pretty based for the New York Times..." and then I realized, it's the Post. 
Sports Extra?
The post is one of the only outlets telling it like it is.
I wouldn't be surprised if the attacker were paid by Urban Meyer so he could get sympathy votes to ensure a spot in the NCAAF Playoff
Right that's it, ban the knife
Where is the "safe space"?
**NYPOST IS NYTIMES NOW**
This is a very honorable move by the New York Post. So many fake news out there, it's good that someone speaks the truth. If you can't talk honestly about a problem, if you fail to call a spade a spade, then you are part of the problem yourself. So everyone who doesn't call this terrorism are obviously not interested in protecting the freedom the terrorrists hate Americans for in the first place.
Holy shit.

Im surprised a major news paper worded headlines in a way that is true.
Apparently ISIS has claimed responsability:

https://nypost.com/2016/11/29/isis-claims-responsibility-for-ohio-state-attack/
New York Post DGAFFFFF
People who are strong don't have to constantly remind others that they are "not weak."

What a pussy
I love waking up in the morning to the fresh, sweet smell of TRUTH.
This paper looks like the national enquirer. Just by the way it is laid out, I don't trust it. 
Man I need to subscribe to this paper.
"The important thing to remember is that gun control worked because he didn't have a gun and wasn't able to kill anybody" - Retarded lefty. 
Any clever Trudeau eulogies for this fine young man yet? 
Huffpo: "Broke refugee trying to sell steak knives to feed his family brutally gunned down by racist cops!"
Wow NYT is white supremacist! Kek
Atleast he died wearing the same blue shirt.  

I wonder what the cop is thinking looking at the dead body
Well somebody at the NYP just got fired
I don't claim to be speaking on behalf of all centipedes, but Islam is bullshit. Even if you consider yourself a moderate or half-assed, Muslim your holy book is still one that promotes murderous shit like this. Guys who do what these terrorists do are actually devout Muslims. They do things by the book, the same book that you consider your holy book.
Was this ever verified?
Stop spreading fake fucking news, hell this isn't even news, it's a fake fucking facebook post. Delete this shit.
They are redpilling each other now. They are trying to make our job obsolete!

Going to buy a spare ar15 firing pin and start wearing that
Old and as far as I know unconfirmed.
THE DAMN CUCKS STRIKE AGAIN FOLKS, trump better keep his word on nationwide carry.
please dont post fake news...
* **Ambulance meets protesters blocking road.**

* **"Do I respect them and stop?"**

* **"No.  I'll come back for their corpses later.**

#FLOOR PEDAL!!!
They are definitely proud of themselves. Remember, liberals hate other *liberals*. The only thing a liberal loves is his or herself. 
Tolerant left strikes again!


There is no proof that that really happened. Dont become like ETS with fake bullshit.
I don't think this is true. It's been reported for weeks but no one has determined location of this event. 
The protesters are literally protesting democracy.
this was never confirmed. please don't post Propaganda 
This is old, but still deserves an upvote.
https://i.imgflip.com/1f0oef.jpg
They should pick one arrested protestor out of the lineup and throw the book at them, gin up 30 years of charges like they did for OJ in Vegas. Make an example of them, plaster it all over the news.
If it were up to me, people blocking the highway would be shot. 
Maybe they should add Cow Catchers to all emergency Vehicles.
I propose the following solution to prevent this from happening again:

https://i.sli.mg/KwaJo7.png
The talk on r ems is that this never happened.
Are whole thing here is to stop fake news. Take this shit down unless you can tag a source.
And that's the exact moment the protests stopped.
Since killing is too much paperwork, I propose we use high powered BB guns or rubber bullets to mow down these peasants . If a group of deplorables were to get ahold of 20-30 riot shields, the could form a phalanx and decimate a crowd.
If there is video of this, identify and prosecute the blocking people for not allowing emergency vehicles to pass.  The death is on those tools.
Shit would make a motherfucker want to start mowing down protesters.. just sayin
Sick.
This is why when a Facebook friend of mine defended roadblocking so "protestors voices could be heard", I couldn't even. I was so pissed for how stupid her thought process was. Super progressive liberals make me as sick as super conservatives
Reason number 51926589345 to just run over road protestors.
this is old and it hasn't even been verified as true, and it would be hard to verify.
Speaking of safety pins, wasn't that memed by 4/pol/ and is originally a signal that you wanted "safe" gay sex?
Isn't this fake? Don't be silly guys.
Whoever posted this should either make an edit with a link confirming the story to be true or delete the post. We need to be better than the lying MSM when it comes to this shit.
This shit is fake and it's been four hours. Why is it still up? Your fucking delete button broken, OP? You just posted something else 10 minutes ago so it's not like you're not still here.
Please don't post shit you don't know is true or not. This isn't facebook. Take that shit elsewhere.
[removed]
This is unverified and mods should delete it until it's not.  We don't want centipedes to look like we fall for unverified news items.  
None of this would have been possible without Geert Wilders. When this is done he deserves a medal.
Ban it everywhere except your place of worship and your own home.  No exception.
You're right a step in the right direction but judging by these numbers we have a long way to go https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_kKkY5EpVpY
Sorry, but these people look like terrorists. You can't be in public with your faces covered like this, it's illegal.
So I'm torn on the Burqa Ban. I don't like the idea that a government can tell someone what to wear, or not to wear.... BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND, systemically forcing women to wear one is no better. So aren't they -- in practice -- banning the mosques from banning the women from not wearing burqas? I think I typed that right. 

Idunno. Torn.
Stores during Halloween post signs at the entrance saying wearing masks in the store is not permitted. Having your face obscured is a risky situation. Having a burka on is no different. Might as well put pantyhose over your head and walk into a bank, it's the same principle. 
How do their kids recognise them?
I'm ok with the head scarf but this is too much. I also think it's a hazard while driving as it blocks your peripherals. There's no FUCKING way you can tell me it doesn't. Try driving with a hood on and turn your head to look back. It's a hazard and it should be illegal to wear a hood or burka while driving as it is dangerous. And these people don't know how to drive as it is.
Georgia the state is trying to do this too.  Using the same law they used against the KKK.  Same concept really, for public safety we have to know who you are.
The burka isn't a integral part of Muslim identity at all. There are lots of Muslim women who don't wear any headwear, or make do with a hijab.

The burka in the West is a symbolic act of "fuck you and fuck your culture, I refuse to integrate". It belongs in a theocratic Islamic shariah-compliant society only. It has no place in any civilised Western society. 
If any of the electors change the national vote won't this potentially start a civil war in the US anyway?

Surely electors are more afraid of the rule of anarchy than death threats by people who get tired from leaving their basements.
"If you don't vote for who we want, we'll kill you!"

Yes, this is how freedom should work. 
Based Armenian
just phone up Ted Nugent, he'll protect you!
Thanks, Micheal!
If any electors flip, I hope there will be an honest, thorough investigation to ensure they weren't threatened or paid off. We can't go through this crap every election. 
Thank you Mr. Banerian! 
fucking a white male! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! 

He was smart to go to the press.
For them, hate speech against america is not hate speech because america has power and privilege. Only things which are oppressed can be targeted by hate speech.
Both are free speech, including hate speech. 
They are both free speech. This could apply to some people on our side if you just flip the meaning. The 1st amendment is one of the most, if not the most, important amendment. It must be protected. 
This is gonna be meme of the year I swear 
Using their logic, burning the flag is Hate Speech against veterans.  Therefore, we should ban burning the flag.
Stellar shitpost
Hate speech is a social construct.
the amount of airtime and variety of subject matter this meme keeps hitting on in its different iterations speaks for itself. the liberal mindset is literally crumbling

Desk not messy enough.

Although, I have a feeling that the Oval Office will be ceremonial and day to day affairs will be elsewhere, perhaps in Trump Tower.

I'm quite okay with this.  
I hope he decks out the Oval Office with as much gold as possible. It would make libs want to puke. 
I love that desk it's beautiful 
Sticky. 
Lol, plus they tacked an extra 400k onto the fee...
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhyhhhhhhhhreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Look...#NO HANDS!
Stein - Stumped


Hillary - Stumped


Soros - Stumped
Hopefully Pennsylvania & Michigan denies steins lawsuit as well. It's not the actual recount that's the issue. Obviously there could be some shenanigans come up with the clinton regime. I think another issue as well is this prolonging of the ultimate result only gives the loosing team a false hope that a miracle will happen which is extremely unlikely or pure fraud. It's kind of the "picking the scab" result. I hated it when obama won twice and I sulked myself but I didn't go rioting, burning down the neighborhood, beating up people, didn't go around screaming f*** obama and while the last 8 years have been horrible in my opinion, I've had to deal with it. It's called being an Adult. But Thank God that  in 51 Days 13 Hours (& counting down) that President-Elect Trump will put his hand on the Bible and take the Oath of Office and be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States of America. That day can't get here soon enough for me.
Interesting that they haven't paid yet. Wonder if they are waiting on the hand recount. 
I'm certainly not letting my guard down, because she is Crooked Hillary after all (a satanic, cannibal, pedophile) but I'm entertaining the possibility that she may be trying to stop it so her voter fraud isn't exposed.  Either way, fuck that nasty bitch, we'll do whatever it takes to make sure the only place she's headed is prison (or the gallows).
Steal my president and the only thing they will get is war.
Remember Scott Foval? IIRC, he mentioned Wisconsin as one of the states where cheating would be easy. Clinton's team joined the lawsuit because they don't want Stein to figure out how the Dems screwed the Greens. 

Let them fill themselves at the trough of sorrow. 
Clinton wasn't propped up "in spite" of being the worst Dem candidate.  She was propped up BECAUSE she was the worst candidate.  The Dems hate greatness and they want everything to suck as bad as they do.  "Joining the recount" was necessary for Clinton to do because it's what someone who sucks would do.
They cannot complete a hand recount in the available time, or for the 3.9 million estimated for the machine recount.

If the democrats want to be remembered as the party that disenfranchised a state for no good reason, give them the rope.
It's times like these I fear that my child will have to take up arms in a meme war far worse than the one I fought in...
They can count Wisconsin a thousand times for all I care, it won't change the election.
This is important.

Also, she's driving the dems in DC crazy...
Pfft, Trump has better lawyers. His are busy learning the law, while Clinton's are just some of her kiddy-diddly buddies.
Whose hands?

Let them. PA deadline has passed Michigan did a certified count already.
Yeah but... Pennsylvania expired a whole 8 days before she asked for a recount so yeah she's not winning.

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!! SJW's unite to save this man that white privileged males have forced to stand there!!!
That is glorious. 

And the building is nice too!
Next time I'm in DC, I know where I'm staying.
Fucking white ma-   Oh wait
Love it! Enjoy!!
I guess the protesters are busy losing somewhere else! Is there good security around our new president elect? Inspect the troops while you're there!
Check your white privilege.. your camera isn't calibrated correctly.. it made you look like a "person of color", but surely that cannot be.


Check your white privilege!!!!!
I broke out into a smile just seeing that building. It's incredible the feelings this man is able to inspire in me just by seeing his name.

Take this upvote based American!
What about that guy?  
Did the black ones just not show up that day?
5 days?

i wish this were 6 months. Just an awkward amount of time to be missing from work (oh wait! thats right they dont work) but short enough that these fucks can change their behavior
Finally some justice for these idiots.
The fact that there's so few that they can be arrested shows that the fraudulent "movement" is running out of steam. 

Unfortunately, they'll get out of jail thinking that they've made some great sacrifice for their non-existent cause.
Maybe they'll think twice about their actions if they are actually punished for breaking the law.   Will Soros be paying them for their jail time?
Only five days?
Yay. Happy ending.
Must not have been any Somali refugees on the road that day.

That one protester's last name is Whiting. She has white guilt squared.

Should make them work in a chain gang picking up trash along the highway.
As a Virginian this saddens me, they should of gotten a much longer jail sentence
Virginia courts don't F around.  
Perhaps 5 days is just long enough to make them feel like hardcore activists...could just embolden them to do it again.  Should have sentenced them to long hours of community service so at least they'd be put to good use.
üëåüèªThey should have the DoT estimate man-hours lost in traffic and have the perps reimburse or serve that many hours. 
**HAHAHahahahahah!!!  They're all white!** 

I saw a BLM march on TV and the black protesters were telling the white protesters to get to the back of the march, let the black people be in front.
It's amazing that they left their basement. That takes some courage. 
Richmond has VCU which is a very liberal school. I'd bet most of these protesters were students there. 
They look just like I thought they would.
Should be executed
Only 5 days for blocking an Interstate.  This only encourages them to do it more.  They will treasure this picture and post it on their facebooks thinking that they are heroes.  
As Milo once summed it up nicely (and I paraphrase) "So basically be nice to us or we'll kill you?"
Was having a discussion about Trump with one of my friends who happens to have her PhD.  Her argument was that we shouldn't antagonize Muslims, as that would only incite them to commit more violence.  She did not understand that she was only helping me make my point: why risk taking on such people if things they deem offensive (ex: cartoons, gay bars) are enough motivation for them to slaughter people?

But oh, what would her fancy, gubment-teet-sucking friends think if she didn't toe the party line?
Fun fact, only Democrats owned slaves.

It's not just Latvia. Many other countries too.

Sure, you might be able to burn a flag in your own backyard without getting caught, but to do it on the streets is a felony.
Flag burning should fall under all laws regulating public burning.  If it is not legal to burn cardboard boxes in the middle of the street then it should not be legal to burn the flag in the middle of the street.
You know, for all the years flat burning has been legal, I've never seen it not be disgusting.

I think either (a) it should have the same protections as hate speech laws or (b) all hate speech laws should be repealed.

Either we're all allowed to be pieces of shit or we're not. Why do the communists have special privileges?
burning your flag in mexico is punishable by up to 3 years in prison(iirc)
It SHOULD be 100% legal and protected by law to burn US flags.  At least flags first heavily doused or soaked in gasoline (provided only regular safety cigarette lighters are employed for ignition - safety and all).

For the non-gasoline soaked variety - honestly I do not PERSONALLY care much either way.  As long as the burner owns the flag.  At a minimum, it allows photos to taken of such a burner - which could be used against the individual were he/she to run for political office, etc. 

 
The flag is a symbol. If you really want to protest, then burning the flag is a way to do that. If you get rid of that option people will find other ways and other things to do to cause an outrage. I think really, people need to stop caring so much about that symbol. I think only when you're able to let someone take a massive dump all over that flag and just leave them looking stupid when nobody even bothers to care about it or complain, will you really win against the anti-American sentiment that act is really expressing. They've already won if you get upset about it. 

Instead of being offended that someone is offending your country by burning the flag, stop giving a shit. The more it offends, the more people decide to listen to have a look at what they do.

Also finding it kind of brill that the edit is changed to "spez" now. 
I am all for less government so I do not think flag burning should be illegal.  Just another stupid law.
The only people who would care about this is the people who were planning on burning a few flags 
Ok, I came here expecting a potato joke.

The comments here reflect a respectful conversation which include disagreements

The illiberals ought to take notice


I mean, by burning the flag aren't you pretty much saying you hate the country you are in and all those around you?  It's basically denouncing your citizenship.  Why should we think you aren't a threat?
I don't think it should be illegal. Gonna have to disagree on this issue.
Why the hell are so many people here okay with burning flags? Okay, cool freedom and whatever but what good comes out of it? 


Flag burners get zero respect from majority of Americans and they also get played so much on 24/7 news. It seems the only thing burning our flag does, is give other countries a bad image of us. 


Take away burning the flag and people will have to come up with arguments rather than gaining national coverage from lighting a flag on fire and letting that do all the talking.


SPEZ: I'm in no position to make that decision. That being said, I'm just stating my opinion. Not saying what's right or wrong. I just feel it doesn't benefit anyone but OTHER countries by making the U.S. look bad.
Based
Rage against the Machine and other "I need to make a public statement" entertainers might get their panties in a wad about free speech, but all they have ever used free speech for is to turn a huge profit, so fuck them. 
Citing examples of things that are illegal in countries i wouldnt want to live in as a reason for why it should be illegal here does not make me want to agree with you.
We are free here and would like to keep it that way.
Why not just say,"Ok, no burning flags, it's against public burn laws!"

Problem solved. No flags can be burned. Done.
Flag burning is a beautiful act of freedom. I don't understand why people get so riled up about it. The flag is just a symbol, as is the burning of it. Regardless of why the person is burning the flag, the right to desecrate that symbol of freedom is proof that the freedom that object symbolizes is real. 

I believe flag burning specifically needs to be preserved as a right. Our veterans did not fight for the flag, they fought for the country and freedom the flag represents. Banning flag burning makes the flag meaningless. It makes it a false idol, something to not be questioned but worshipped without thought.

It's just cloth and dye. It has no real value. The flag is not the country and its people. It's is just a symbol. And it's when symbols become untouchable that shit starts to go off the rails.
Liberals: "I'M BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG BECAUSE IT SYMBOLIZES OPPRESSION!"

Conservative: "Can you not burn my flag that millions of Americans have flown under and died for?"

Also Liberals: "WOW, BRO, IT'S JUST A PIECE OF CLOTH. LIGHTEN UP."

I can only think of a few reasons why you would want to burn an American flag in public, and most of them suck.
EU flags are made with inflammable material so people can't even burn it.

I think burning the Flag is one of the most disgusting, disrepsectful things you can do as an American. Having said that, im completely for it being legal. If you believe that the constitution is absolute, then you really have no argument to make flag burning illegal. 

If you advocate for making flag burning illegal, then you're no better than the kids you rail against for having "safe spaces."   

My biggest complaint against flag burners, besides it spitting in the face of service members, is that its usually done for completely moronic reasons. "Our neighborhood is in shambles, and we're killing each other. How can we fix this? How about we riot, burn flags, and destroy our own neighborhood. That'll teach em."

  
Such is life.
I like keeping flag burning legal. makes it easy to spot the pieces of shit.

Freedoms have consequences. Freedom of expression means you aren't going to like what everyone has to say.
In regards to the legal issue, I could see an strong argument made that burning it is not a form of protected speech because it implies the excitement of violence. Other than this legal path, it is, in fact, a form of protected speech. 
Burning the flag in a respectful ceremony is how I have always retired old flags, so the act of burning the flag should not be illegal.

That said, I believe it is the right of every American to be wrong: They can burn the flag as protest. And we can deride and mock them vigorously for it.

It may not be illegal, but regardless of whether or not the flag stands for what they think it stands for, and regardless of whether they consciously intended for it to be the message of their action, burning the flag says clearer than words, "the flag of my father will not be my flag" and anyone who feels that way and chooses to burn the flag in anger has already decided to turn their back on everything the flag stands for, including the republic.

Trump trolling them about the flag burning was long past due.
Well, I don't know what exactly was proposed in SHillary's flag burning act, but the correct way to dispose of a damaged US Flag that is no longer fit for flying is to burn it in a dignified way.

> The United States Flag Code (4 USC Sec 8 Para (k) Amended 7 July 1976) states: "The Flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem of display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning."

Also:

https://www.vfw.org/Flag

However, this is a far cry from the animals burning the flag in the streets. My point is, don't get roped into the counter-punch of "well, the flag should never be burned" because under the right circumstances, burning the flag is absolutely the correct thing to do.
If you think its okay to burn the American flag, you should tell that to Seth Rich's outfit. Shut your fucking yappers, if I see you burn a flag around me ill report you to God Emporer.
My father was a United States Marine, he would kick the shit out of anybody he saw doing that. Hell, growing up he didn't even allow clothes that looked like they were made out of the flag (like swimming trunks) as it was disrespectful.

I hope the left get good families one day so they quit acting like such punks.

Can we deport Illegals that burn the American Flag. They're not protected by the constitution anyway. 
Its totally anti-free speech and weird to outlaw flag burning. I hate when people do it, but its their right.
What the flag represents is infinitely more important than any individual flag. People need to remember that while burning one flag -or a million for that matter- is disrespectful, it can in no way diminish what that flag stands for. To my mind, the act being protected only burnishes what the flag represents, and burning one only makes every other flag fly a little prouder. It is a despicable act, but the fact it can be done is worthy of celebration.

As an outsider looking in, I feel that legislating against flag burning would diminish what the flag stands for more than burning one ever could. Many countries and cultures may be insecure enough to need legislation like this, but I hope the US doesn't become one of them.
What's more un-american - burning a flag or preventing someone from burning a flag?  

Hint, it's the fucking later. 
Personally I hate it when these clowns burn the flag and as a Veteran who personally knew 3 guys who did'nt make it home, it really offends me. 

If it was up to me I would make it illegal. But that's just my opinion. Its protected by Free Speech, and they you have it. Issue Settled. 
I would think it is more a preventive measure. People might still do it in private but burning the flag and posting it on social media they won't think twice. In any case it will prevent the spread of it on social media sweep people burning the flag under the rug so to speak to keep it out of the media's eye. And if they media does not see the rest of the world won't see it and think we have Americans hating the country they live in.
The only thing that could get me to do something as despicable as burning an American flag is hearing the news that flag burning has been outlawed.  That being said, anyone with a brain knows he's not going to actually push for this, and even if he did, Congress and the Supreme Court would never let it happen, which leads a sensible person to the conclusion he's trolling the shit out of his opposition.  They'll look stupid, go on rants about flag burning... some might actually go outside and film themselves doing it.  GOD please let that happen.
This is exactly my thought. If someone wants to burn the flag of his country, he should have probably already resigned his citizenship amd moved away. You should definitely, and proudly, outlaw flag burning.

I cant wait until someone asks me if I remember Tim Kaine and I think about it for a few seconds and can't recall ever hearing about someone with that name. 
The Five on Fox discussed this tweet. It was a very good discussion. 
This tweet is false. This is a knee jerk reaction tweet he updated his stance some time after.

https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/803301570167373824?lang=en

I'm an Ohio State centipede. Every report for hours after the attack was there was a shooter. Many eye witnesses even said there was a shooter. The full story where the attacker only had a knife didn't come out until much later. Kaine was praying for our community according to all the information at the time. 

I love an anti-lib circlejerk as much as the next person, but this is a terrible example. It wasn't a bogus tweet, he just wanted to express support as soon as he heard what happened. Let's go after a real problem 
"Senator"
To be fair when I first heard about the news it said that there was a gunman on OSU's campus. I only later found out he was a madman who ran over people with a car and then attacked people with a large knife.

Senseless act of gun violence...holy shit Tim

At that time it was thought to be a shooting. There were reports of shots fired, which in hindsight was probably from the cops gun.

I would have loved his 30 minute interview during primetime on CNN so I could learn about how this is the fault of unemployed white middle aged men that hate women. Maybe NPR will interview his family so I can find out about the terrible oppression he faced. At least it is tofu Tuesday at the university, so I can take my wife's kids down to visit the therapy dogs and listen to jazz in my safe space. I'll bring my yoga mat just in case.

Thank god for this subreddit. As we speak there are people on reddit justifying this fucking piece of trash by saying it is our fault they can't assimilate and to give it four or five generations and watch how beautiful it is going to be. And then they get gilded five times.

Of fucking course if we wait five generations they will eventually have stopped being fucking barbarians, but that is not our fucking job and that is what they don't understand. I don't give a shit if they cant spend ten minutes on google educating themselves. It is not our job to make them peaceful. And this is all coming from a bernout who used to be pro-refugee.
What a surprise.
Consanguinity is a helluva drug
He called Anwar Al-Awlaki a hero in his FB manifesto shortly before the attack, wtf other info do they need?  FFS....

*edit - typo
Fuck these people, man. I would like to immigrate to the US someday, but people like these make it harder for me to do. I hope Trump deports them, so legal immigrants can move into the country more easily. I'm working on my education and expect to work for my bread, not just leech. These "'"refugees""" come to other countries and try to destroy everything that's good in them to make them more like their shitty home. For some unexplained reason, I have to apply for a bunch of papers, pay a good chunk of money to get those papers and actually move, and meanwhile here we have illegals who do nothing but leech and cause terror. And the left won't even admit that there MIGHT be a problem. 
Instant sticky!
People are often good, until they put religion above themselves.......

Except Soros.
Waiting for Obama to make a statement regarding schoolyard violence. 
I heard someone on CNN yesterday cautioning not to jump to any conclusions; we can't just go around assuming every Muslim who runs people over with a car and then attacks them with a knife is a terrorist.  I wish I were embellishing that, but they essentially said just that.  
This is Columbus' SECOND Muslim knife attack. The 1st in February by a guy named Mohammed in a crowded restaurant. That was not terrorism. fucking idiots. #PoisonedSkittles
But the news told me he was a victim of Islamaphobia
A Muslim a terrorist???? I have it on good authority(CNN) that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance!?!? WTF I AM GOING TO LITERALLY SCREAM RIGHT NOW!!!
Is anyone surprised by this? Most of the last few attacks, the feds had totally dropped the ball on their investigation previously.
O RLY?

So the guy was complaining about the stereotypes of Muslims are wrong.  Then he fulfills everyones stereotypes of Muslims.
Whelp now he's definitely getting invited to the white house. Under the Obama administration of course.

Oy vey, guys! Don't leap to conclusions!
"They're not weak!" 

Yeah cause running over defenceless innocent bystanders and stabbing them is strong!
If he had used that forehead as a weapon he probably would have been more successful.
"Possible"?
Guy is obviously not 18.  Fake news. 
#Im sure it's all just a coincidence him being Muslim and stuff. It's a peaceful religion bro. 
You're all jumping to conclusions ! The media clearly said they are "Still trying to find a motive" ...even after ISIS gave clear commands to follow the Nice attacks by plowing cars/trucks into crowds, and the fact this Somali then got out and stabbed victims just as palestinians have been doing in Israel for past year lol
"Purposeful Intent"   
  
Is this a new lib word? I'm getting sick of everyone letting criminals decide and explain after the fact what their intent was.

We Columbus residents expected this at some point. The Somalian population hasn't assimilated like other cultures. They remain isolated and living among their own.  It's sad.  

I'm just glad the only person to die was the bad guy. His virgins are neck beards. 
Time bombs waiting to explode. A bad day at work. A fight with a lover. Their rival hogs all the playdoh after Trumps victory. 

Radical is just code for devout. Islam is AIDS.
CNN: Muslim PoC killed by police, gun, after car crash.
The media will simply not cover this at all. Not one area of the narrative fits with this situation.
He voted so he's American. He's not that black, so he's actually a white nationalist. He could have used a gun but chose a knife so you can't have guns anymore. The cop is a Nazi. And so on
Sunni Muslim males will go on the attack if they feel they are not being treated like superior little princes. That is one of the many problems in Islamic culture all over this planet.  When Somalian males revert to type, they hack at people with machetes.
The guy said there was no place to pray for him on campus.
Curious do they have a church or a synagoge to pray at on the university? If not why even think to complain about this....
Who, that guy, nahhh! Sounds more like a case of workplace violence to me.
They have to go back (to Somalia).
You spelled "probable" wrong in the title.
#MODRE CAR-KNIFE CONTROL! 
Cracks me up how a year or two ago the students were so mad that the OSU police had an MRAP. Now no one is talking about how they wish the cops didn't have that. 
Is it confirmed that apart from the 9 harmed, ke killed some1?
Gee whiz
They keep saying that Abdul Razak Ali Artan was 18 but looking at the photos of him, I call bullsh*t.  He looks more like late 20s or early 30s.  I wouldn't be surprised if he had slept with some underage girls while lying about his age.
It wasn't a terror attack, it was just a "terrifying" attack.

http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2016/11/28/nine-hurt,-suspect-killed-'terrifying'-ohio-state-attack/94559514/
His name was Abdul, he was a Muslim, from Somalia. Yes, he was a terrorist. 
Nothing left to investigate.

Every time this happens, my Muslim friends in social media go quiet for a week, until around Friday, when they start flooding social media with links to old-ish articles about Muslim women being attached/killed in the western world for "being muslims."

The #fakenews acts like it's nearly an impossible connection for a refugee to kill people and be a terrorist.  

If you are an asshole, terrorzing innocent people, you are by definition an asshole terrorist.  What do we need audio of him eating at the Aloha Snakbar?  


Just imagine how much worse this act of terrorism could have been if that policeman hadn't been there.
He was scared so he ran some people over and stabbed them.

Tell me again who should feel scared of who? 
Was the attacker dressed like a pirate? 
The guy was just practicing his religion.
Are you sure?  I read on CNN they are still trying to figure out what the notice was.  They said it would be another 3-5 years of investigative journalism before they would know for sure, if ever, the motivation for the attack.  #FakeNews #Retards

And /s just in case. 
From the interview with this creep:

> Artan gave an interview to university newspaper The Lantern on his first day at Ohio State on 23 August, telling reporter Kevin Stankiewicz he was concerned about fellow students reaction.
"I wanted to pray in the open, but I was scared with everything going on in the media," he said. "I'm a Muslim, it's not what the media portrays me to be. If people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don't know what they're going to think, what's going to happen.
"But, I don't blame them. It's the media that put that picture in their heads so they're just going to have it and it, it's going to make them feel uncomfortable."

Like .... You just went on a jihad killing spree but it's *the media* who put that idea in peoples heads?
My dad was at OSU at the time this happened. He's a law abiding American Muslim. Why do some people have to ruin it for us?
Ill take anyone in the world as a refugee over somalis , legit the worst thing that can happen 
What's to investigate??
I first heard of the OSU thing I was like "This is so fucked up, I know Trump will come out and extend his best wishes to these people."  Then after the fact that there was what could be a mass shooting/terrorist attack going on I said "What are the chances this guys another Muslim?"  And of course I get home from work and check out an article and the dudes name is Abdul.
Born in Somalia, immigrated from Pakistan. I wonder what he was doing in Pakistan? Probably wholesome activities that help the community like picking up litter!  
It wsan't terror, the car gain self concious....
The investigation may never untangle his true motives.

I mean, who knows what all this means? bunch of mumbo-jumbo. 

> name-checked radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, calling him a "hero."

> suggestion that the U.S. could stop "lone wolf attacks" by making peace with "dawla in al sham," an outdated name for ISIS. He wrote that he had reached "a boiling point" and included a bombastic vow to "kill a billion infidels" to save a single Muslim.

> "By Allah, we will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims. You will not celebrate or enjoy any holiday," the post reads.

btw he's supposed to be 18??? in the immortal words of Marcus Burnett, [Muthafucka you look 30](http://archive.is/rTw48/811d70d95a869581597af62247ebae7c57af6069.jpg)

America needs to wake up to the fact we are not at war with terrorism, we are at war with Islam. 


Anyone have the facebook post this article is talking about?
https://i.imgflip.com/1f0oef.jpg
" possible "
Someone needs to lecture the refugees, or maybe we stop accepting them. I'm saying this for their own good. There is one vital difference between America and any other country accepting refugees. That is Americans have a shit ton of guns. In Europe, people just get really pissed off. In America, people will take action as vigilantes. 
There were 43 homicides on average DAILY in 2015. I'd be willing to guess we are around the same level in 2016. But sure, better focus all our attention on this. Because it fits the instigation narrative. 
Have we confirmed if it was a butcher knife or machete yet?
#FREEKANYE
Don't know about y'all, but running over people and slashing them up was my first clue.

Cant wait to see all these patriotic liberals burning American flags in protest. 
Suddenly the twitter leftists cares about free speech? What about all this talk about banning 'hate speech' and 'fake news'? Burning a flag could be considered hate speech, no?
Holy shit. His greatest shitpost ever. Twitter is 250,000 degrees into a meltdown already. 

#(Rubs hands together) MSM IS GONNA LOSE THEIR GODDAMN MINDS TODAY!

My man is up early and already has baits in the water. Lmao. 


"Illustrate absurdity by being absurd." - Rush Limbaugh

This is one of the things that I love most about Trump; he knows just how to trigger.

With all the Leftist Castro love going on, a tweet like this will cause them to react with their usual 'Literally Hitler' bullshit...and then the irony is revealed. Yet again, they bitch about Trump 'saying things' when they have praised or done the very things they're LITERALLY SHAKING about.

It's so brilliant - dance, puppets; dance.
This morning is gonna put the commies into defcon 1 when they wake up in the late afternoon. He's attacking their MSM mothership, and calling them out for hating America?

I wonder how many times Trump has to trigger them before they run out of tears.

Unfortunately, the Soros money is endless, so the multitude of payed shills are gonna be rioting soon.
I love that he has zero filters for his emotions. That's the best thing about him in my opinion, his honesty. 
Not sure if I agree but looking forward to the inevitable meltdown from the Left. 
Let's go to Mexico. Burn the Mexican flag and wave the American flag and see how well it goes.

Libtards lose their minds in 3  2  1 . . .
Sweet. He's gonna trigger them to death. The salt must flow.
To people freaking out about this: it will never happen, and the reason that Trump is saying this is probably not that he wants it to happen.

All these protestors protesting that America will be ruined by Trump, sure seem to have a lot of Mexican and ethnic flags!

Not an American one in sight unless it's being burned.
Don't agree here; but he's setting up another chess piece. Tell them you want something disagreeable so what you really want doesn't seem unreasonable.

Happy Tuesday to you too Mr President-Elect!
Trump is smart. Burning the American flag is utterly disrespectful, and this tweet will get the media to defend liberals burning the flag while showing videos and photos of them doing it. He said only "perhaps"; this tweet is purely to trigger the left. I love it. 
I heard that in Hungary it's against the law to abuse or degrade the flag, the anthem or any other national emblem. The maximum punishment for this is, as you guessed: 1 year in jail :)

It's easier to spot the retards and the subversive elements if you allow them to. I disagree as well. Freedom of expression and all that, even for the crazy ones.
At first I was taken aback by this, but then I remembered that Trump publicly acknowledged how powerful his twitter account was. Then I thought about the MSM reaction.

Think about all those normal everyday Americans that are about to watch the MSM defending burning the American flag today after yesterday's attack by a radical Muslim.

Incredible!
I've always supported idiots rights to burn the flag. 

I am all for free speech. 

However it is ILLEGAL to have an open fire in most cities so arrest the fuggin idiots! 

If they stole the flag from private property charge them with theft! 

The rest of us AMERICANS will shun them for the commie pinkos they are!

Completely disagree with Trump on this. But, I am looking forward to watching the Left melt down, and seeing the same idiots who've been attacking free speech for years start defending it. 
[removed]
Looks like the following categories are listed as unprotected speech:

Obscenity

Fighting words

Defamation (includes libel, slander)

Child pornography

Perjury

Blackmail

Incitement to imminent lawless action

True threats

Solicitations to commit crimes

(And some argue treason)

I would argue burning the flag, though not fighting words per se, would be a fighting action, can be interpreted as a true threat to the republic, and definitely could be regarded as treasonous. It's not like there isn't precedent or that this is totally uncalled for.

My wife says in India people can get killed for burning India flag
Nope, this is settled as free speech, and should be respected as such. Instead we should crowdfund them a one way ticket out of this country voluntarily.  Not interested in limiting liberty!
#FINALLY

Is there nothing else these motherfuckers can burn than the flag that has given the world everything? Fucking despicable fucks
I mean, I personally wouldn't jail people who burn the flag, freedom of expression and all that, but something tells me this tweet is just part of another 4D chess move.
Yes Yes Yes !  I Agree 100%
He now gets to sit back and watch his critics in the media rush and tell us why flag burning is so important, and our most and sacred right.  Love it.  

All this entertainment in the time it takes to write a tweet
Massive flag burning in 3..2..1..  he's trying to get leftists to show themselves as anti American.

This is too far. Downvote me if you like, I've been a Donald supporter since the beginning but I'm not going to blindly support whatever he says because "He has some other plan (4D INTERGALACTIC CHESS LULZ)"
Oh my lord the comments on that Twitter thread-these people are actually defending burning the flag.

Commies, folks
I'm torn. On the one hand, America has a thing called the first amendment to protect flag burners...

One the other hand, deporting all leftist flag burners and giving their citizenship to people from other countries who would be happy to live in Trump's America may not be a bad idea... I mean I'm happy to swap citizenships with an Anti-Trump American if they want to.
I actually really disagree with this one

If you legally own your flag, you should be allowed to deface it

Now, *burning it on* ***public property*** is often a fire hazard so that should come with fines, of course, but burning a flag on your private property is no one's business but yours
Love Trump & I disagree
I love Trump, but I've gotta disagree with him here.
Don't agree with this at all 
[removed]
Ok I get that he's baiting people but I strongly disagree with the notion of arresting people for burning the flag. Freedom of speech is protected even if it's speech we disagree with.

That being said I can't wait to see the triggering this will cause.
I completely disagree with this statement but I admire the raw power of such a shitpost.
Holy shit, Trump is inventing new dimensions of chess. 1776-D intergalactic chess folks. 99% of Americans will agree that you shouldn't burn the flag, but the left will support the fringe anarchists who do burn it, revealing them to be unamerican. This is a tactical shitpost folks.
We have the right to free speech, but there are limits. You can't, for example, tell government secrets to an enemy and then try to claim free speech. It is still considered treason. I would be okay with flag burning as a means of protest being classified as treason. 
Liberals will never understand Trump. Except one liberal at The Atlantic put it into words: Trump supporters take Trump seriously, but not literally. Liberals take Trump literally and not seriously.
This man is the greatest troll that ever lived. Watch what happens - libs will start burning the flag in public and uploading videos of it. CNN will defend them and their right to do it - making them look like they support flag burning. Trump will sit back and watch the show. Rinse and repeat. How do they keep falling for this shit?!? The thread over on /r/politics is hilarious to read. These supposed "intellectuals" are all being played and they don't even fucking know it. 
Freedom of speech means allowing our citizens make asses of themselves. 

Sorry Donald, I disagree with the statement. 
Unpopular opinion here, but I think flag burning should remain legal. I think it is a childish way to protest, but it is still a nonviolent form of protest. It is protected under the 1st amendment. And the government revoking citizenship for crimes like this would scare the shit out of me.
I realize he is triggering, and it's really funny. However, being a law grad, not SJW, would like to point out a few facts about our flag that make it different than any other in the world...I had these facts pointed out to me in law school class argument, and walked out of class LOVING our flag more than any other flag anywhere in the world... Here were things I never understood about our flag, that were pointed out in the arguments.   I concluded these things below are the very things that set our fag above all others in the world. See what you think. Our flag should ALWAYS be able to be burned. It's not just a simple "American Protest" tradition... it is much more.


Our flag stands apart, and is elevated above all others BECAUSE it can be burned without people being thrown in Jail.... Because it belongs to We the People... not the STATE or the Military, like all other national flags.....BECAUSE it stands for the 1st Amendment, and not just the Military, or the Government (King, Empire etc)... Our Flag is unique because it belongs to the people of the nation, and it stands for an IDEA that creates the nation. It's stands for freedom as an IDEA. 

There is no other flag that can be legally worn by it's people in celebration on the 4th of July, or Tuesday next week. There is no other flag that can be torn legally, and put on a soldier as a tourniquet in the field of battle. There is not one flag in the world like ours. 

People in other nations have no flag. Their GOVERNMENTS have flags THEY must respect. Ours belongs to us, not the government.... It stands for us, and represents the ENTIRE Constitution, INCLUDING the 1st Amendment. THIS..."freedom of the flag"  is seen nowhere else in the world. WE have EVERY reason to love our flag like we do. It's probably the ONLY flag in the world worth dying for because, it actually is OUR flag. We appear to be the only people of a nation who actually OWN a flag, as a free people?

And so....It's REALLY tempting to pass a law that takes the flag away from the people, and gives it over to a government demanding "respect" or... a military "demanding respect".... This is what other nations do.


However... such an act will DEMOTE the flag to the same status as every other flag on the planet. The Flag will no longer be the true American Flag anymore, if it no longer belongs to the people, and we give it to the Feds. 

How do we know we legally own it? Because if you own private property, you can do what you want with it, without legal ramifications, so long as what you do does not harm others. As long as we can burn the flag, without jail time, it is still ours, as a legal matter. Question....Do we REALLY want to give the flag ownership rights to a swamp that will have to be drained probably three times over the next 1000 years? Does the Federal Government deserve the right to take our flag from us and demote it to simple "national symbol status? 


 Here is the pinch, in America, that will never go away, as long as we are a free people: The question is... can WE stand to see our flag used in a manner we don't like, by other Americans when they use it to voice opinions we DON'T agree with? Can we once again say to one another as Americans.... "I hate what you say, but I'll die for your RIGHT to say it?"
Can WE power through that, to make certain THIS flag is NEVER lowered to the status of simple government symbol? We had and argument in law school about this, that I will never forget. Now ....I love our flag more than ever.


My conclusion is that I love our flag MOST, because it is THE ONLY ONE on planet earth.... that can burn for it's people. It's the ONLY flag that can speak for we the people, even scream... for US as a people, if we need it to. And yet, it can still be blessed and laid over the caskets of those who gave so much for it. When the flag is laid over the casket of a soldier, it is a gift, from US, not the government. Isn't that cool. 
I doubt anyone ever thought about just exactly how incredible our flag is. We don't ever get a chance to think about how truly unique the Constitution is, with respect to the flag. There is no other.. No.... not of either one.

It's a flag that truly represents America. D'Sousa, the immigrant who created the "Hilary's America" documentary, put it something like this: All other nations are simply nations... but America, is an IDEA.


 You can immigrate to China, but you can't "become Chinese". You can't become French or Italian, if you immigrate there. But you can Immigrate to America... and BECOME an American from anywhere in the world. This is because America is unique in all the world... and so is her flag. 

Lets think twice before DEMOTING the only flag in the world that actually stands for that IDEA of freedom instead of just another nation.....  The only flag that is actually OWNED by The PEOPLE, and not just another country. This, is my humble opinion.


 Love to the greatest flag to grace the planet....ever.. and it's mine to love.
Disagree but wanting to ban flag burning is a valid opinion. One could argue it isn't speech because there is nothing being expressed, in fact in the Supreme Court's flag burning decision a dissenting opinion was written to that effect.
#O'ER THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE JAILS FULL OF CUCKS
Totally disagree 
i agree with loss of citizenship, the flag represents respect for the laws and constitution and free speech - in most countries u have to pledge to accept those things when u try to obtain citizenship 

but year in jail seems rough. 

mr. trump pls stop winning 
I disagree, it may not be a popular opinion here but I am for personal freedom. if some American wants to burn the flag, I say let em.  
..

We should never punish someone for expressing themselves. This is unconstitutional. 
I personally think people should be able to burn the flag as a symbol of free speech, but I do think it's a scummy thing to do, you should get a fine, not lose citizenship or face a year in jail for that. 
Disagree with this. Freedom of speech guarantees you the right to be as much of an asshole as you want as long as you're not causing panic or violence. Is it terrible? Of course. Will proud Americans hate you for doing this? Rightfully so. Most of my family has served in the military and I'm proud of what they've contributed to keeping our country safe. But should people be thrown in jail for it? I don't think so. People died to protect all of our freedoms, including the freedom to be an ungrateful asshole. It's pretty ironic that the only reason flagburners can burn the flag is because of the men and women who've died to protect that right. Plus this has already been established in the courts as legal. 
Burning the flag is within their rights. Even though i disapprove of it ( 8 years in the army 12B ) I would punch anyone i saw doing it but they have the right to do it. You cant start dictating that it starts a slippery slope.   
This was the law of the land for years until that supreme Court decision. I would be okay with a constitutional amendment restricting speech in this one case. Respect for America dictates a less offensive way to speak and protest.
It's brilliant because even the left secretly think flag-burners are douche bags. They will make intellectual arguments about free speech, but all people emotionally detest people who do this.

I know liberals will jump on the freedom of speech bandwagon when presented with the argument about burning a flag in a Muslim country or Mexico, but to put it in another context: How would you react if someone in your household, on a daily basis, was subversive, made up lies about other family members ("racist," "homophobe," "Islamophobe"), made suggestions about the patron/matron of the family being murdered (flirting with the idea of Trump's assassination), and caused violent mayhem in the house any time their feelings were hurt or felt wronged by proxy (riots)? Not only this, but they topped it all off with taking an image of the family (complete with deceased family members) -- a literal representation of the flag's meaning -- and burned it in front of everyone as a public statement? You would probably have made them leave long ago, never to associate with them again.

It isn't freedom of speech, and it isn't how freedom of speech was intended. It's sedition against this country and everything upon which it is built and everything for which it stands. These people are not to be pitied and are not some fringe case covered in a constitutional loophole, nor are they attacking an opposed group that just happens to be American; they are making a statement that they are against the body and soul of America itself, and therefore are an enemy.
How to break through a SJW's cognitive dissonance and encourage critical thinking.  
At a minimum burning a flag that you do not own constitutes vandalism, arson, and creating a public nuisance.  The perps should be prosecuted under these laws.  For example a large public flag might cost in the $300 - 450 dollar range.  Burning said flag is destruction of property.
yes Yes *Yes* YES **YES**
Or a good fine to make more flags
I really hope the God emperor is playing some 4D chess on this one, because it's the first thing he's said that I disagree with. Burning the flag is disgusting and disrespectful and I think you're human trash if you do it, but it's still your right as an American.
He's exercising his free speech and flag burning was ILLEGAL until about 1980.

People will of course; play these absurd mental gymnastics.
Gotta say, I disagree with trump on this. burning a flag should be protected under free speech
The irony of liberal shit-stains claiming they give a fuck about our constitution.


These kind of tweets used to worry me a bit because of the mountain of media shit that would flow his way each time he made one, but now that he's won, I just roll my eyes and laugh. He's got all of the power. He knows it and he's playing them like fools.

Making these statements makes the media freak out and continue their rampage against him, which only hurts their credibility further. History shows actions speak louder than words and his tweets are irrelevant. Most people will see his actions of picking people for his cabinet and sticking to his guns on his policies and judge him from that. The media will continue to flail and focus on irrelevant tweets. 

It seems that the media forgets the President can't make policies. So even if he is serious about these things, which history shows he probably isn't, he couldn't make the law. This is what happens when you have a person in office for 8 years who they believe is infallible and should be making federal law at the stroke of a pen. Now all of that power they gave Obama is in Trump's hand and they are petrified that he'll use it against their agenda. 
I love how he end his tweets with exclamations. It just makes it that much more satisfying knowing that when the liberal finished reading it they have to suffer that final "!" And then most likely react with an "oh my god I'm literally shaking"

i disagree , freedom of speech. 
I literally just emailed exactly that two days ago to a relative. instead of a year in jail, i went for 30 days and a 5000 fine. the citizenship thing, spot on!
Burning a flag is freedom of speech as long as it's not a fire hazard. Can we not advocate for giving the government more power?
Thank God. I can understand not agreeing with your country on certain issues, but to give a huge middle finger like that to the whole country? Why are you even living here?
Freedom of expression is real; but there are consequences for certain expressions...such as screaming "I have a bomb" on an airplane. You have the freedom to say it, but a consequence is that you're going to get your ass searched by the TSA asap.

Love how he uses the exclamation point when he's trolling.
Honestly, it's a terrible precedent to punish people for slighting or physically injuring a mere symbol.  It's starting to infringe on freedom of speech and protest, and I wouldn't have such a law on the books in the States no matter who proposes it.  

In Israel where I live some people get in trouble for burning the flag, and it's absolutely ridiculous.  Nobody gets hurt - should not be a crime.
I like Trump but this is fucking stupid even if Hillary supported it. Jailing people for protesting the government is against the very core of free speech. 
We'll have to disagree here. 
No one will be burning flags when you show them that winning is all you do mighty God Emperor Trump!
Unfortunately burning the flag shouldn't be illegal.  It's a form of protest that shouldn't be censored.  Is it horrible? Yes.  Should it be illegal?  No.  It's not cool at all, but we don't want to censor everyone like the dem's do.

Conversely, this should also extend to being able to display the american flag without persecution.  If you can burn it, I can wave it.  LOOKING AT YOU, UNIVERSITIES BANNING THE AMERICAN FLAG 
I disagree. I understand the sentiment; as a member of the military the flag means a great deal to me, and I hate seeing it desecrated. However, I took an oath to the Constitution, and that guarantees freedom of speech. I would much rather endure hateful expression than see a restriction of personal liberties. The fact that we don't have laws restricting hateful speech, unlike some European nations, is what makes America special. If we have to tolerate flag burning so that we can shine as a beacon of liberty, then I hope that is what we will do. 
i agree with trump on just about everything, but the flag they are burning symbolizes the very freedom they are exercising by burning it. freedom of expression cannot be encroached on. 
This is definitely the first thing of Trump's that I'm 100% against. Of course, burning the flag is super disrespectful, but it is technically free speech. 
Free speech is free speech. 
Okay liberals: he tweeted this. Now you have to defend flag burning. Go.

I'm rabidly pro-Trump, but I have to say this either needs to be clarified or it's a pretty stupid gaffe.

We don't strip people of their citizenship over flag burning, that's straight up fascism.

I'm even against fining them like Hillary proposed.

It's 1st Amendment, free speech.

Let people that burn flags be exposed and mock them.  I'm even up for buying them a one way ticket out of here for good.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Flag_Code
>When a flag is so tattered that it no longer fits to serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of America, the military and other organizations regularly conduct dignified flag-burning ceremonies.[11][12]
I disagree. It doesn't bother me if you want to show the world just how ignorant you are. 

Speech and expression. It is what it is. 
Hey boss! Focus on the MAGA, if we wanted the 1st Amendment challenged we would have never gotten on this train. 
Sorry, I can't agree with this. While I would never burn a flag or recommend anyone do it, free speech is more important than a piece of cloth with some dye in it. Downvote me to hell if you want but if we are trying move away from political correctness, that's going the wrong direction. If you see someone burn a flag, tell them they are stupid, or ignore them, or laugh at them for being spending money on a flag and then burning it, but don't create a bullshit legal safe space because you don't like something. When they go low, we are busy making america great again.
Nope, totally disagree.
Big Trump fan, but as vile as burning the American flag is, it's freedom of expression/speech. 
While I wholeheartedly hate seeing the American flag being burned, I do think it falls under freedom of speech. But don't get me wrong, I will still hardcore judge everyone who does it.
"The Collasal Triggering of 2016" is still happening.

We are witnessing history, and I fucking love it.
I actually agree with this.  Its supposed to be freedom of expression,  protected by freedom of speech.  But really,  its a anarchist tactic who really have nothing to say, so they burn the flag. By burning the flag, they are attacking the very thing with which their speech is protected by.  People who burn flags should be cast adrift in a raft and lose citizenship.  

 The NFL comes down on tim tebow but lets Krapernick kneel.  Its time to correct history.  In fairness,  id rather just do away with all leftist.  Put them on islands.  
Burning a country's flag in that country can be seen as going beyond freedom of speech.

When those people are waving another flag and you find out that they are citizens of another country... You are facing an invading army.

It is hate speech, Hillary wanted to ban this! so they whine about Hate speech. They blame the right for whatever.They accused Trump supporters and he asked them to "Stop it" when they have absolutely done nothing. There you have it. Stop the hate speech leftists. So the confederation flag was hate symbol? What a 4D chess! 
Loss of citizenship seems appropriate, but the question is where do you put those people?  If they were originally  foreign nationals, you can deposit them at their home embassy, but a natural born citizen is difficult to reconcile.

Hate to say it, but while I believe that burning an American flag makes you a scumbag of the highest degree, I believev that the 1st ammendment should protect you from being jailed for it. 
More A/B testing from Trump


Trump should come back and say that burning the American flag is hate speech, but he acknowledges that it's protected, no matter how despicable.

Their heads would implode.
The normies on r/Redacted are waking up. Some of the top comments on their thread about this are calling out his bait. That and Muh Facism.

Also he didn't say he WOULD jail them or deport them. He is just saying "perhaps" that is what should happen aka he knows it can't and won't happen just that he wishes it would.

The left is not reacting well, as expected, so far i have seen "thanks for your service, but you fought for a country not a symbol", "are you worshiping the flag like a false god?"


It goes on and one, these people are delusional. God Help us.
Lol this is obvious bait, as hillary supported a similar bill in 2005
I disagree, but apparently he might just be trolling?
Hopefully this is a ploy to demonstrate the absurdity of first amendment infringement. The switch to a non-personal freedom oriented stance definitely supports the idea. 

Don't get me wrong, I hate people who burn the flag, but I think it's an important right, if only because it shows who the ungrateful shitheads are. 
While something I'd LOVE to do, I don't support this at all.  This coming from a 12 year military veteran.  Just helps us identify who to punch in the face.
ha ha. Man, this is getting presidential.
if people want to go to the store to buy their own flag to burn, that's fine.  but taking down a flag from private property to burn should be punished as theft and/or vandalism (as should be in the case of the hampshire college incident).
So now no one is talking about a recount.  :-)
I honestly think he was just posting this without having much of a plan and I am perfectly okay with this. He knows any law he makes would be unconstitutional, but he was just speaking his mind. The people wanted a candidate who is willing to speak their mind and talk directly to the people without acting like they were better. Trump is one of us who hates flag burners and thinks they should leave the country if they hate America. He is exactly who the people  voted for and he will Make America Great Again. 
I know this is completely out of context but isn't folding a flag and burning it an acceptable way to retire a frayed or worn flag?
This man doesn't hug flags for show. Anyone who doesn't respect the flag - and the country it represents - enough to burn one should be tretreated as a non American citizen. I think the loss of citizenship is fair because I hate flag burners, but making it a felony with a a year in jail results in loss of certain rights so that's fine too.
Deport them to Cuba!
I don't have a problem with someone burning the flag. I do, however, have a problem with an organization calling for the murder of law enforcement. Let's deport them instead. 
Hope he's not serious and just triggering libs here, if its the latter, bravo Trump

We should have a bot start counting how many times Donald or T_D triggers people on Twitter.  It would catch up quickly to the Trump Train bot.

no brakes.
It's still a heated debate, last time SCOTUS ruled it unconstitutional it was a 5-4 vote so it was really close, besides many countries implement a clause that protects this, it's like saying on Twitter "I am going to assassinate X", sure it's free speech but don't expect no retaliation, then there's the phylosophical part to it, the tolerance of intolerance kinda thing, where if you burn the constitution that represents free speech, are you still protected by that same constitution ?  

All in all, excellent move by Trump, get the leftiest to create a hashtag where they burn american flags.
Speaking of free speech and burning, try using the Constitution as a defense when screaming "fire" in a crowded theater when there is none.     
Indeed some things should not be considered "free speech", just because they are "spoken freely".  

I love that even supporters fell for this! Trump is truly the 5D chess master.
Why do many think this is just some ploy to get the left up in arms? Take a look at this post or any right and middle leaning posts on this and it clearly shows all sides have people against this. Showing the loser of the election was for this doesn't make it clearer, and it makes it more concerning. He also has made similar comments in the past.

This sub of all places should understand why it is important for freedoms of expression to be upheld. The moment you want to censor some bodies freedoms is the moment you open yourself up for the same.   
Unfortunately, we can't do that. Because we can't Violette the first amendment. But just to keep us safe, that would make sense. As burning the flag means you don't want to be in America for the right reasons.
I don't support this..  but I love his attitude. Fuck whoever burns it, but it shouldn't be banned. At the same time, lefties who think this is facism and are now pulling out "the constitution" hate the second amendment, love Obama who violated the constitution plenty, and wanted Clinton who violated federal law by concealing information when it was demanded of her. They're full hypocrites
They SHOULD be allowed to burn it as form of protest. I SHOULD be allowed to then drag them by their ear into the middle of their neighborhood and spank them with a belt or a paddle (as a form of protest).
I'd be 100% OK with a law that says if you choose to burn the flag... you just rescinded all the protections and provisions of the constitution in the same act.

That way... those of us who actually love this country could beat the living shit out of anyone who burns the flag... and do it lawfully.

I think that's how it should be.   Disrespect the country... OK you can do that... but the consequence is you no longer have her protections and provisions and you're on your own.   Then comes baseball bat to the knees time.
Revoking their citizenship and deportation sounds fucking awesome to me
I don't think it should be illegal, it's one of the bedrocks of our democracy.  It's a way to voice your displeasure, yeah it might piss you off, but it's their right. 
Trump has a whole grab bag of spicy twitter posts that will continue to point out liberal hypocrisy. Tweet by tweet he is solidifying his reelection and he hasn't even had a single day in office yet. 
A friend of mine and I were young teens vacationing in Turkey.

As we walked by a government building he jumped up and was just able to touch a Turkish flag hanging next to the doorway.

Immediately 4 guards/police/soldiers ran out the front and proceeded to wail on him with their batons.

He was curled up fetal on the sidewalk fussing and protesting while they beat his ass. I wasn't any help either.

They stopped after a bit, and went back in the building. The boss guy explained that they were not arresting him for dishonoring their flag, because we were foreigners and didn't know any better.

The beating was considered enough to point out his mistake. They hit him a lot, but not terribly hard.
I might be outside of the norm here but I do think burning the flag is protected under free speech.  However, fire is dangerous and I think we should be able to act in anyway to protect that fire from causing any additional damage.  If said burner just happened to be hit by a fire hose at full blast that is just protecting the people from harm by the flames.   
This is perfect. All he has to do is say he wasn't serious about it and this will trigger the left into burning the flags throughout his term and making themselves look like a bunch of stupid communist assholes. 
Liberals yesterday: "The constitution was created 250 years ago, it is out of date and needs to be changed"

i KeKed at the socialist party's comment, FUCKING LOSERS! 
they can burn they flag if they want, as long as it's a flag retirement ceremony.


The media has gotten so sloppy and careless, even a 10 minute check would've shown Hillary wanted the same thing.

He's destroying their arguments like you would against a small child, truly sad to see what the media has become, a shadow of it's former self.
Call me crazy but isn't burning one of the proper disposal methods of a flag?

Obviously tastefully burning it, not at a protest.
What about for ceremonial reasons?
Trump is playing with Liberals. He already made them protect Free Speech TWICE since election. First Hamilton and now Flag Burning.
I agree with him here. I'm for free speech and free expression. But we don't allow acts like harassment and stalking that encourage violence. I think we should ban this sort of behavior that encourages violence and hatred of America. I also think we should protests of funerals, but that's just me. 
If we can't get 'em because of the 1st amendment, we'll get 'em for arson, littering, inciting anarchy, or burning without a permit.
I say no jail. Just lose your citizenship. Why be here if you're gonna burn the flag. I hear Cuba is the new spot. 
FUCK YES!!!
I've just understood what the PEOTUS is doing; he's trying to kill off SJWs via tweet-induced heart attacks.  Good work. 
I don't like it. The day I burn a flag is the day I leave the country. Flag burners are entitled cunts. However, can someone convince me why a flag burner deserves to have their life ruined in prison? Regardless of how powerful a symbol it is, it's a piece of cloth. Keep the law out of it, leave it up to the pissed off veterans to deal with these scummy liberals. Don't fucking argue with the first amendment. 
I think that burning the flag is an un-American atrocity and people who do it should be taken and publicly denounced. 

But i am against making a law about it. If we make a law infringing on a constitutional right, then we are no better than the liberals that are constantly trying to infringe on any other constitutional rights. I don't like the fact that the flag is being disrespected like that. But banning it sets a dangerous precedent.
Must... Stop... Winning!!!!
Trump, we like you. But don't you dare fuck with the Bill of Rights. 

Dissent is sacred, and as a Veteran, I like seeing flags burned if only to remind me that this is still a FREE COUNTRY. 

If this is a ruse, find a better way to do what you're trying to do if it's legitimate. 
Let's not talk about a year in jail when the justice system is giving rapists less time

When you burn a flag, you burn what it stands for. That makes you a self described enemy of all those who follow and uphold what it stands for. You're committing an indicative act of violence on the highest form of national symbolism. That makes you an enemy of the state.

Intent is key. If you burn it because it's cold and you want to get warm, then so be it.  If you burn it at a political rally, jail/prison/deport/fine.
So is no one going to discuss how awful it is if someone gets put in jail for this. More dumb non violent crimes?
 
burn the flag(outside of respectful disposal) or disrespecting it in protest should be considered hate speech because it is hurtful to all Americans who love this country
The only people who burn flags are leftist, they dont care about our rights, why should we care about theirs?

Free speech should should be for all speech except inciting danger. what happens when we see that all that disagree with the libtard agenda, we are labelled supporters of hate speech. The world is upside down black is white. I served this country, and while it is shitty that these thugs burn the flag, I support their right to do it. I have been a supporter from the beginning, and will remain a supporter.
Texas v. Johnson? Sorry PE Trump, Flag Burning has been a valid form of protest speech (Isn't it also the proper way to dispose a flag too?)
Like the guy but I def don't agree :/
Burning your Countries Flag is saying you don't want to be a part of that country, so yes revoke their citizenship, I would never Burn a Scottish Flag (would totally burn UK one though tbh) #FuckWestminster #FuckHouseOfLords #FuckRoyalPaedophileFamily
Although I don't agree with burning flags...it's pointless and sheer "look at me I need attention". I think it should be treated no different than setting anything else on fire in public, however, the flag represents the freedom to burn a flag if you so choose. I don't agree with making this illegal or anything of the sort. Just charge people with arson or whatever the danger is, but 1 year in jail? That's a bit absurd and extreme.
Is this not the very definition of PC? 
This is utterly retarded. 
Ok someone has to reel him in a bit on some of these. 
Or not. 
He is right, why are people here disagreeing? 

If you hate your country so much that you would burn its flag, GTFO 
If flag burning is illegal it also ought to be illegal to use it on tshirts and marketing campaigns on beer owned by multinations and bullshit like that. It's either a sacred symbol or a pretty picture. I'm ok with either. 
Disagreed. 
The left loved fidel castro so they should be ok with the same punishment if a Cuban burnt the Cuban flag right?
No. While unpatriotic we have a 1A and the supreme court ruled that it is protected. What makes America great is that we have the right to do this, people have a right to burn the flag and we have the right to ridicule them and call them commies. 
What I love is how this is exposing people on both sides. The crazies that support this idea on the Trump side (there's plenty in this thread alone) and the leftists who are losing their goddamn minds, meanwhile are ok with limiting free speech in other ways.

There's no way he believes this, it's too bad he has to throw himself under the bus to make a point.
Can someone please explain what he hopes to get out of this? I understand that it's bait, but to what end?

I understand that this is all strategy but I profoundly disagree with this, if he actually intends to pursue a law of this type.

It's just a piece of cloth people, stop projecting your feelings onto it.  If America is so fragile that burning a piece of colored cloth constitutes a threat to our freedom then we're already past the point of no return.
Reading all the twitter responses blows my mind how people think it's A-OK to speak like that to the prez-elect. I mean, free speech and all but goddam these people are so disrespectful. They've really forgotten how to be a decent human being. Jeez.
I've never understood how/why burning our flag would be protected under freedom of speech.  I agree with the Don, burning the American flag is a disgraceful act and should be punished accordingly.

SPEZ:  If you disagree I'd prefer to hear your opinion instead of just getting downvoted...
I can't understand people here disagreeing with him on this.

Your flag is sacred. Desecration should be a punishable offence. Trump is 100% right.
They should put hazerdous chemicals in the flags so people are injured when they are burnt
Ah no.

I see a lot of people in here talking about chess pieces and shit posting... I don't see how this is productive for President-Elect Trump - can someone help me out?
I really don't understand Trump's logic the last few days. He's been tweeting indiscriminately except for the OSU attack. I feel like instead of shit posting at CNN, he should be picking the best cabinet members and sorting out his policies. I know he IS doing that stuff but he needs to put the election behind him.  
or maybe he's just tired of evil terrorists getting shot

I have quit watching it, cant apologize now. I grew up on sportscenter, its a SJW fuck zone. Fuck ESPN and fuck the ass hats who do SC.  
Brought in all sorts of virtue signalling and race baiting garbage.
Bye bye
Yep.  I'm done watching.  Funny thing, almost everyone I've spoken with about ESPN feels the same way.  They're leaving good 'ole ESPN behind - permanently - as well.
Cucked
Drain the Swamp ESPN... and maybe only maybe..
#FUCK YOU DISNEY
Too late, let them be a warning to other networks out there. Worldwide Leader of Cucks
That wasn't close to an apology or anything. He just recognized that viewers are seeing a leftward slant. Gonna have to do better than that ESPN, or you're toast!
The attempts to ram soccer down our throats didn't help either.  I would occasionally flip on to see the scores on the crawl, but it takes 30 minutes for them to get through all the obscure soccer leagues they show the scores for.  They could save time and only show games where somebody scored a goal and just say all other games = 0-0.
If we all stop watching CNN / ESPN for just one year, news and sports will move back to the free over the air channels in better quality than cable / sat and they will do their jobs without the liberal agenda. I think they will learn their lesson. Worst case, you will have been spared all the crap for a year ;)
Break up the media monopolies!!!!
Cancel ur cable...shitpost alone aint gonna do it...why pay them to lie to you? 
it gave bruce jenner a fucking award 
Unfortunately I have to go through ESPN to watch most of the sporting events that I am interested in.

That having been said, I refuse to watch all of their "filler" crap. They call it "analysis" but it's all just talking heads trying to sound smart.

In the end, it saves me time anyway. Who cares what some paid "analysts" think? The only thing that matters is which team plays the better game on the court/field.
I password protected it on my oder bros TV over thanksgiving, (he is the type who won't call Comcast and wait to talk) boycott by force.
I don't think they allow campaigns to be conducted from beyond the grave.

In order to run she would have to steal the nomination again and even then I don't think she's healthy enough to handle a third campaign.
I have a feeling trump will just be pumping out positive accomplishments fast and hard. That even some of the hardcore libs and dems will give him a second term. Just to see some shit getting done in this nation.
I mean, if her only points as a character were that she had (bad) experience, how is she going to stand a chance after four years of MAGA.
Maybe now it's Her turn?
Please no, I can't handle that nightmare again.
Her Parkinsons will have advanced too much by then.

I wonder if it will be another obvious rigged primary where it is just her and and unknown communist running. 
I tend to doubt this is viable, usually once a presidential candidate looses, the party won't run them again. I may be wrong, but I can only think of one at the moment, Richard M. Nixon.
After four years of economic, social, and foreign prosperity.

After four years of exposing even more of Clinton's shady dealings.

After four years of deporting illegal aliens who vote.

After four years of her aging to look even more sickly.

After four years of tightening voter ID laws to prevent fraud.

After four years of waking more people up to the media lies.

Trump/Pence 2020 with 400+ electoral votes confirmed. 
I don't think she will be able to wear her little Nazi pin  (remember..not the American flag her stupid pin...) on her orange jump suit. They don't allow sharp things to federal prisoners in the general population.

Please yes dear god.

I think she should be prepping for 20 to life.
Prison, mental home, hospital, cemetery, Saudi Arabia, Oprah's attic, Podesta's basement, divorce court, all possible.

Another Presidential campaign?  With 24 medical care, doctors holding her hand, people helping her up steps, the being thrown into the van like a piece of meat thing, with all that this time she could only average around 1 public appearance every month.

In four years, she is going to be moving around like Jesse, that dog on Family Guy.

"Keeping minorities away" is code-word for "enforcing ID laws"
Here's a good article with facts about the case:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/28/the-facts-about-the-voter-fraud-case-that-sunk-jeff-sessionss-bid-for-a-judgeship/

Seems this whole thing isn't so open and shut as The New Yorker's lack of details would suggest.
Ah yes, Jeff Sessions, the man who got a KKK elite executed. Yes, I believe I saw him scourering the inner cities looking for minorities, and like a messed up Santa Claus, visited every house and locked them up with the help of his mystical bigo-elves (they're like elves, but bigots!). I was about to vote Trump on election day, but being that I'm Hispanic, Mr. Sessions came to me on his KKK-sled and said "Oh no, minority! You ain't voting today!" and forced me to get a voter ID card. I was literally shaking!
[deleted]
Democrats are the most racist, hate filled group in the world at the moment.
So the whole Russia hacking thing would have to be a coordinated effort to physically access the voting machines. We've all seen the videos where a thumb drive with malicious code can change the results from the tabulation machines. It would require physical in person access to pull it off. Either Russian agents disguised as American citizens who were on the voter rolls went in and changed the machines code to favor Trump or election officials tampered with the devices afterwards, means a criminal investigation into those with access and on the rolls is warranted. 

Apparently the left with the DoJ in their pocket does not want to pursue this avenue of investigation because it never really happened. 

When enough people are led down the path of the words "hacking" and "Russia" as being synonymous for foul play, they'll believe anything even when the reality of this election is, it never happened. 
Archive links please. 
Was this before or after he successfully prosecuted the head of the KKK and got the death penalty?
That article... 

> Only unusual issue is an uptick in absentee voting

> this is due to hacked machines

What the fuck m8?
LOL poor Jeff.  He's a such a mellow dude.  Did he throw a free banquet for those who didn't vote?  Is that how he got them away from the polls?  LMAO what a joke the media has become.
Please archive The New Faker next time. 

>the Russians might, just might, have fixed the election‚Äîafter all, they hacked John Podesta‚Äôs e-mail.

To the best of my knowledge it hasn't been proven Russia was behind Podesta email hack, just allegations with unnamed sources. If it were true, this would be easier for democrats to push than a vote recount. Especially when Obama is still in charge.
Newsflash!  Racist Republicans are working to disenfranchise black voters under the guise of stopping voter fraud and maintaining the sanctity of our elections.  Clearly acts of voter suppression! /s

1985 called and wants it's false narrative back.  Shit's not new.
What the lying media won't tell you about this voter fraud case is that it went on long after the 1985 case, and then a decade later this happens:

>The promise of spoils also led to stiff competi¬≠tion for seats on the commission and to voter fraud. The Birmingham Office of the U.S. Attorney and the Alabama Attorney General conducted an extensive joint investigation of absentee ballot fraud allegations in the November 8, 1994, elec¬≠tion.[9]  **By the end of the investigation, nine defen¬≠dants had pled guilty to voter fraud, and two were found guilty by a jury.** The defendants included Greene County commissioners, officials, and em¬≠ployees; a racing commissioner; a member of the board of education; a Eutaw city councilman; and other community leaders.
**All of these defendants were part of a conspiracy to manipulate the outcome of elections for local offices in Greene County** and the town of Eutaw to protect incumbents and their allies from challeng¬≠ers. **Notably, almost all of the candidates involved, on both sides, were African-American Demo¬≠crats-so the usual partisan conspiracy theories do not hold any water.** The case is worth studying for that reason and because the methods the conspira¬≠tors used were typical of absentee ballot fraud.

With that said, absence of a prayer room still does not allow you to stab people.
Who gives a flying fuck why he acted out?  There is absolutely zero justification for his actions.

[Here] (https://ohiounion.osu.edu/plan_an_event/view_event_spaces?room=27)  is a link to their Interfaith center:

>It "features two Ablution rooms and two Meditation Rooms"

[Here] (http://www.msaohiostate.com/) is a link to their Muslim Students Association. 


Even if true, it's still the worst excuse ever.
Not having a prayer room is an acceptable excuse for *fucking stabbing people to death* now? That's not 'acting out'. That's fucking murder.

As a longtime liberal it hurts me to say this, but *how are leftists this fucking insane?*
Oh nice! Another fake news story from the MSM
Why does a campus has it though? Its a place to learn and better yourself. Not a place to pray and certainly not a place to pray and worship poisonous and foreign ideology. 
Well of course they have...
Didn't Brigitte Gabriel and someone else mention this. That the MSA is a branch off the Muslim brotherhood indoctrination manual???


https://youtu.be/PFO1AtjoUoo?t=28m26s
But he needed his own, personal, state provided, pray room equipped with 9 years old boy, or at least with a decent goat! Islamophobia!
Why is there a Muslim center? Why don't I have a Catholic Center or a White Male center?

Close that shit down until they can provide me accommodations as well. 
OMFG the media will spin even the most evil thing to fit their libtards narrative !!!  Mainstream media is the cause of 95% of the division in the US !  Why do they keep doing it is the real question !
That's three prayer rooms and one student Assoc too many. 
A curious aspect of my religion is the incorporation of these mobile stripper platforms (look up "electric flower cars" if curious) for major events. 

Can i start requesting schools to provide these if i go back to college?
It's good that Officer Horujko made good this piece of shit, thereby circumventing a lengthy media circus trial where the media and liberal lawyers will portray him as some 'oppressed hero'.

Moral of the story: when a terrorist goes on a rampage: shoot first, ask questions later. Don't hold back.
Yea, but didnt you read what he wrote. He said the campus was so big he couldnt find them. I guess the best option instead of asking an administrator or any other person on campus was to instead ram a honda civic into a group of people and then hack them with a machete. 
I think every major university campus has an interfaith room or some student group related to their religion.

Absolutely no reason to go around stabbing people. Those affiliated with him need to be investigated, including the MSA if he was involved with them.
Clearly it's missing an offensive driving and stabbing centers.
Ohio State is one of the most liberal and diverse campuses in the entire United States. On any given day, you could see activists for Judaism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism standing on all four corners of the Oval, talking to students as they pass by. All opinions are welcome.

The only shortcoming came in 2012 when Barack Obama was invited to speak, but Mitt Romney was not. 
Sure they had a prayer room, but were there enough gummy bears???
From the OSU link above:
"This space also features two Ablution rooms and two Meditation Rooms."

Had to look up ablution room -- it is a special place the wash the body. https://cfs.osu.edu/gallery?&page=4

The entire on-campus religious accommodations in public colleges is a thorny one. Take ASU for example. Large Catholic population, and there is a wonderful Newman Center (Catholic). I don't think it is funded w/public $, but it is there for the students. So I can't make a judgment about it, nor the OSU facilities, until there is more info on where the funding comes from. But i do understand the argument that neither should be permissible on a publicly-funded campus. 
Muslim student association = Muslim brotherhood
There shouldn't have been any "prayer rooms" or "interfaith centers" in the first place. 
Yes.  If they didn't have all that Muslim-friendly stuff, he wouldn't have come to Ohio State, and this would not have happened, at least not at OSU.

Campuses etc. have to protect themselves by eliminating Muslim friendly provisions.  If it's illegal, make it legal.  I don't stop them from praying etc., I just don't provide a facility for their use in their religious observance, at my secular university.
Of course they have a prayer room.  Universities get sued if they don't.

The very first time I heard that "excuse", I called bullshit.
So in addition to being a radical Islamic terrorist, this dead loser was a complete moron.
#\#6DegreesOfGeorgeSoros
The msm focus will be on the fact that they did not have ENOUGH prayer rooms, not the fact that he decided to murder people in the name of radical Islam. 
Prayer rooms or not, there is never an excuse for going on a stabbing spree. 
Because not having a prayer room gives him a pass to kill everyone. 
The fake news gave a cringeworthy reason, the truth is worth a million facepalms.

They'll never be happy until they kill everybody, and even then they'll still be angry because they won't have anybody left to "satisfy" their needs.

Note: This comment may or may not have been edited by spez
As someone who identifies as a tortoise I'm outraged by the lack of sand and heat lamps on our college campuses.  
Not surprisingly a story is spun that the cause of this was a lack of Muslim stuff, so that to prevent it places will build Muslim stuff.

But the cause was the PRESENCE of the Muslim stuff, and the right course of action (removing it if you have it, not building it if you don't) is the opposite of what they're trying to promote.
"We have prayer rooms! Please don't hurt us!"
These kinds of animals won't be happy until every skyline is littered with full-blown mosques that scream their prayer out five times a day through a propaganda speaker. 
You cannot appease the left.

Never go down the path of trying to do so.

You will become mired in swamp that you cannot free yourself from.
Authorities are investigating an anti-U.S. rant posted on Facebook just minutes before Monday‚Äôs attack at the Ohio State University that is believed to be linked to the suspect in the attack, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, ABC News reports.

Appearing three minutes before the beginning of the rampage that left 11 people injured, the post reads, according to the report, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt take it anymore. America! Stop interfering with other countries, especially the Muslim Ummah. We are not weak. We are not weak, remember that.‚Äù

The post also invokes the name of Anwar Al-Awlaki, a radical American-born Al-Qaeda cleric, describing him as a ‚Äúhero."

‚ÄúIf you want us Muslims to stop carrying lone wolf attacks, then make peace,‚Äù the post reads, according to ABC News. ‚ÄúWe will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims.‚Äù

[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/220978](http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/220978)

Unfortunately yes, they have.    
The left won't stop f**king us until Muslims have their caliphate set up in Washington D.C. and chopped all their heads off. 
I went to Ohio State several years ago and lived with two Muslim guys my last two years. They were parts of huge student groups, of which everyone was Muslim. We had a very accepting campus that went above and beyond to make white people feel like a minority.
Isn't the MSA basically "jihadis in training: college edition"?
Bro fuck these special snowflake victims. Any person who practices the archaic religion of islam is mentally ill. The world now sees them as the snakes they are..


The media is a joke now. Common sense and millions of years of survival instincts tell us all we need to know about the Islamic invader..

This will all reach a boiling point soon
Sounds like 3 prayer rooms too many.

That's where they brainwash these sub humans.
Where did the media say that? 
Does it fucking matter? I don't give a shit if he didn't have a prayer room...lots of other people and folks from other religions don't get perfect treatment, but you don't see them killing people over it...

The prayer rooms available weren't good enough for the snek.
Also: SILENCE on calls over assault knives and assault car bans.

That's what Trump was saying about monitoring mosques more closely (which I'm sure the FBI is probably already doing).  It's not just a religion, it's a political ideology.  There are countless examples of US domestic terrorists getting "radicalized" in mosques or traveling overseas then coming back to blow shit up.
#HEY /r/all! MISS US?
But where's the safe space?
even if that was the reason, he still has no reason to do that and hes still a terrorist
The fact that they have those things is disgusting. 
Even so...

"I don't have a prayer room! Let's stab people!"
I think there are insufficient prayers rooms, or none that were suitable enough  for Abdul. Perverse and evil. Still the cisgender, biphobe fucking white male is apparently at fault. Not Moslems, never Moslems.
If not getting their way, if not having a prayer room, causes people to act out violently to the country that welcomed them 24 months ago, then they are too fragile to sustain a life in our democratic society and must go back.
So, we're allowed to commit attempted murder because we don't get our way? Liberal logic 
Sunni/Shia I bet. 
He acted out because he didn't know where it was and he's been told too many times that "white people" judge him, so instead of asking someone nicely for help, he flipped out.
As if not having a fucking prayer room is a reason to stab people anyway.

**REMOVE KEBAB**
Schools are for learning. Mosques are for praying. If you're in a position to be picky about the institutions you attend, you're not really a refugee.
There's no Catholic Church in my office building, maybe I should flip the fuck out and blame religion too... I just don't understand how that is a believable or relevant excuse, however true or false it is. Mental disorder, liberalism. 

Spez: I'm joining the church of the flying spaghetti monster. Fuck this shit. 
Maybe his country men didn't want him around either, if you wanted to find peace would you want this guy around?
I'm a Muslim at uni. I think most MSA's are harmless. It's a bunch of retards screaming and protesting about freeing Palestine and how Muslims are oppressed everywhere. 

That being said, I haven't really looked deeply into them. 

I can go ‡ºº‚åê‚ñ†ŸÑÕü‚ñ†‡ºΩ undercover ‡ºº‚åê‚ñ†ŸÑÕü‚ñ†‡ºΩ if you want.
Maybe the moron just couldn't find them. 
I think shutting down MSA's nationwide is a bit drastic.    They vary greatly from campus.   On some campuses they're activists while on my campus they're just five people that do their daily prayer together and talk about Islam for an hour.  
This isn't even logical. If he wanted prayer rooms so badly that he resorted to trying to kill people, why would he want a prayer room? Praying is a form of practicing your religion, and murder is one of the biggest sins in Islam. Murder is rarely a forgiven sin, and unforgiven murder is pretty much a ticket to eternal hell in Islam.

This map doesn't mean much.  Landmass does not equal population density.  More people live in the blue islands than the red blobs.  If the population of the country was spread evenly this map would be quite impressive.

I tried to help them cope with their unforeseen loss. I tried to ease their concerns about Trump.

I wanted to help my democrat friends to understand that the editorials and polls they based their opinions on WAS the fake news (they sure as hell weren't true now, were they?)


They put their fingers in their ears and rehearse the same stances that brought them this lose. If they don't catch on soon, I am just going to keep my mouth closed and enjoy doing it to them all over again in 4 years...

i completely understand. this was the 1st election i voted republican. i wasnt on the trump train in the beginning. then one day while watching cnn i thought it just sounded too pep rallyish. so i went to the source, trump rally, to see what was being said. i realized i agreeded with him on many things. after that i started posting memes but never really stating what stance i was taking. then one day i just declared i was on the trump train. i took so much backlash for it. probably 85% of my friends and family were for hillary. now that i have woken up and realize there is so much more to this election i cant stand the ignorance and the unwillingness to even look into the big pic by that 85%. they all think it is still a joke and they are still in the swamp with msm.it is like they are in a trance. i cant wait for january 2017! 

I don't think I'll ever be the same. But for the better.
Today my husband's friend called and said he didn't know about the future with Trump.  My husband told me he supports Trump.  Then his friend disclosed he voted for Trump too!!  We're in San Francisco, CA so there's no one to talk to unless you sense they are based.

My husband sent him many articles and links, of course The Donald on Reddit.  He has a nice big red pill to swallow tonight.
I'm not alone it seems.

I'm a Canadian boy from Toronto.

Hardcore 'pede.

Everybody hates me now. Especially white "friends". Most of my minority friends, especially blacks, don't really care, even though they don't agree. They don't think I'm racist. I don't consider myself white either. I'm a very dark Greek guy lol.

Couple of my Muslim friends are hardcore Trump. But the more normal Muslim friends (or so I thought) think it's literally hitler. These are people that should know better.

I guess someone at my part time job that I do for fun, showed everyone my Facebook, and everyone talks about me behind my back about how I'm crazy TRUMP guy. And I never even talk about it there lol. Unless someone asks. Today they said they're gonna call me Yung Trump from now on. But those are the few cool ones who thought it was funny, and know I'm not a negative or hateful person. The rest think I'm an idiot all of a sudden. 

People have even told me their disappointed.

Outside of work, everyone hates me. Completely. People who I've done so much for and have done nothing for me in return. People I loved and would have died for. They left me just cuz I must be racist sexist for loving Donald Trump. 

The world is getting too fucked I can't stay in cuckville Canada anymore.
I still lurk and shitpost and upvote for multiple hours a day =( then I go to /pol/ and drudge and Breitbart too
Every day is basically like the training scene in the matrix where Morpheus is explaining to Neo that they aren't ready to wake up.

I live in CA so it's a swarm of these chuckleheads. Totally uninformed morons. It's terrifying and it makes life pretty unsettling. Especially on random days I venture into pi$$ag@te land. 
Keep the faith, fellow meme war veterans. With each passing day, a few more people quietly convert to our views. They do so without calling attention to their new thoughts. Without the security of numbers, they won't risk ridicule from friends and family. 

Over the last several weeks, we won a battle. The next thousand tomorrows will win the war.
The best!
Seems reasonable.
This is a GREAT idea!!!!!  

Also, social media and other publicly express anti-American sentiments should bar people from coming here.  
And deport them.  
For some reason I thought it was taboo to desecrate the flag.   Aren't you supposed to replace it if it touches the ground?
Yeah, that's a cool idea!
#GREAT COMPROMISE
You still don't get that daddy is just trolling the media again?
I can't agree. This is a slippery road to saying we will deny people based on their expressions of political belief. 

Requiring them to naturalize and understand our nation and our government should be a limit however. This would teach them why burning the flag was such a terrible act. 
# AND SENT HOME, NO COAT!!!
I bet she calls black people who supports Trump the lowest names. But yet shes quick to defend a terrorist because hes black. 
Another leftists obsessed with race. 
This is further evidence that the left will *always* be the victim, no matter what. Even when "one of their own" kills random innocent people, it's like, totally not his fault.


 "See, it may *look* like he ruthlessly murdered innocent people in the name of his religion, but we should be *sensitive* to his mental condition! Obviously he was a *very troubled* young man, and we need to sympathize with his plight. By the way I am only remotely caring about this persons mental condition because of his skin color. Oh, and BTW that totally doesn't make me racist because I am black and incapable of racism."
Who wants to meme her out of a job? Racists like her can't be allowed to influence future generations.
What would her dying words be if she had been one of the ones stabbed?

She looks borderline microcephalic, what they used to call a 'pinhead.'

Christ, has everyone on the left lost their mind?

If anyone had started acting as an apologist for a piece of trash like Dylan Roof or argued he wasn't a terrorist for shooting up a black church, Dems would rightly be calling them idiots.
Should email OSU and complain that their employee is celebrating the failed terrorist..

Anonymous is so irrelevant, it's laughable (good quote tho) 
Kevin Jackson is a white supremacist confirmed 
With huge debt.
College confirmed Fountain of Youth
"I'm ready to conquer the world! As long as it's given to me with safe spaces, dog therapy, and play dough."
When college sends their people, they aren't sending their best. They're sending toddlers.
Yeah, because primary and secondary schools are doing such a great fucking job...
Our schools destroy learning, our courts destroy justice, our banks destroy wealth and our hospitals destroy health.  We need a fix.
Fuckin a right.  I've been saying this for the better of 20 years yet everyone has said I'm a nut.  I'm all for education, but 4 years at a college is anything but an education.  It's useless nonsense.  I realized it quickly, dropped out, started an IT business and just sold it for $2MM in April.  I held a booth at the job fair from the school I went to.  We had to pay like $750 for the spot so the Dean came by and thanked us.  He asked where I went to school and I told him I dropped out of nku in my first semester.  He said "well I guess you didn't need us.".  To which I replied "yeah." Lol!  Oh I had fun but I couldn't stand the waste of time it was.  And paying for it on top of that.  We need major reform at colleges and even below. 
I have 2 in college, both voted Trump. My nephew in college voted Trump because he had "Better Policies" 

All three are at colleges ranked very high in various national rankings. When I say high, depending on what is being ranked, they all have different top 3 spots...2 of them #1. 

Over Thanksgiving, they all laughed at the stupidity of people around them and their safe space BS. 

I like to think it's because I raised my kids to think for themselves and look at facts. All 3 by the way play and accel at college level sports meaning they left the participation trophy kids behind a long time ago. 
We have identified the problem with society is the schools/education.  So now what are we going to do about it?
Education is a trillion dollar industry in our country. It needs to be disrupted ASAP. 
No, America has raised grown children which they then send to college. This is the result of bad parenting. 
Unless you're in STEM I just don't see the value in college. I've dropped out twice now, I just can't fathom sitting through all the fluff courses and learning about acceptance. I'm already a level headed individual I don't need diversity training, I need a marketable skill that will lead to employment. 
It takes a lot of money to undo 18 years of parental teachings. 

Be strong in your teachings of your kids, y'all.  Explain to them politics and the difference between right and wrong (age appropriate of course). As parents, we're on the front lines of this war.  
I went to branches of both The Ohio State University and Ohio University.  Ohio was much more conservative in their teachings, I found that if I took evening classes they were taught by professional people (not professors) and they taught far more than the liberal professors that did it as their only profession.  



Edited: correcting os to TOSU
He's just being real dawg
What would this white male know about the struggle of black people
Liberal indoctrination is dangerous. 
They want people to not be independent. If they keep relying on authority figures they won't unlock their true potential
I know reddit is mostly the younger crowd, but I feel like a lot of parents with college aged kids underestimate their increased influence on their kids directly after the rebellious phase. If my kid is getting brainwashed by some nutjob prof I would definitely be sure to try to instill some skepticism. 
CNN: Motive still unclear
OK, but let's *still* not jump to conclusions /s

How deep can this pedo rabbit hole go?
Good work on this. 
ive been on vacation for a week

/r/piz zagate got shut down? when did that happen?
I thought the whole pizzagate thing was just another dumb conspiracy theory, but if Reddit's dopey admins are spending all their time to censor the word "pizzagate" everywhere...shit, this might actually be real.
Did you download the archives for the Tribes stuff?

Those do not seem to be working.....
I've looked through most of your archived post. 

The conclusion I have is the internet has allowed these perversions to spread. 

Pre-internet, let's say 1/10 of 1 percent of the population would be deranged enough to do these sick acts. Cannibalism, pedophilia, incest, cutting your dick off and having a vagina created, etc. Most people pre-internet were socially conditioned well enough to not allow these perversions to manifest and remain in the deep dark depths of their psyche. 

Post internet, people with these innate sicknesses will seek others like themselves out on the net. 

They congregate together online, their sicknesses are fueled by each other. And now that 1/10% of society maybe increases to .5%, or 1%. Who knows. 

I believe this to be the case with all the perversions. 
Holy shit
God Bless Texas!
But r/redacted tells me Sanctuary Cities don't exist **(they do)** and downvotes any mention of them into oblivion. 

Is that the fake news everyone is warning me about? **(It is)**

Breitbart hated Podesta because he knew how evil he was. Wish he was still alive to see so many people waking up.
Wow, Washington Times reported this?
Reddit CEO bans pizzagate and MSM finally starts reporting the pedophile ring. Pedodesta the Molesta. 
The DC Pedos have got to be in full cover up mode right now. 

I pray that simply exposing them, and getting negative media attention is enough to save at least a few children.
washington times isn't quite "MSM".
When I still had my Motorola RAZR flip phone back in the day (was a college student), I actually called Andrew Breitbart's mobile number.  (I was FB friends with him.)  It was regarding Meghan McCain's visit to my university...

Mr. Breitbart was a very polite and helpful character over the phone.  [I never met him in real life, so I cannot say from this point of view...]

HIGH ENERGY!
Just the beginning 
Just out of curiosity does anyone know if they are still gonna terminating jobs or closing anything down. It only says saving 1,000 jobs and not if they're gonna be losing any. Side note tho the amount trump has already done and he's not even president yet is so promising ! 
Yahoo!
Those are two beautiful animals. The lion and wolf are pretty badass too. 
Need a poster size picture!!!!!  Gonna make a lot of post cards :)
So am I the only Trump supporter that still counts over 2,000 jobs going to Mexico?

Carrier planned to move over 3k there, and no they say they will keep 1k here. I mean, yeah it's cool they are keeping SOME jobs, but two thirds of them are still going south of the border.
Imagine a Lannister/Stark alliance right from the beginning.  There would have been no war.  Catelyn fucked it all up though.

These are words of an isolated idiot who has been validated countless times in an echo chamber and has no real sense of reality because of a baseless victim complex.

spez: And I find it particularly disturbing that she harbors disdain for people participating in social media BAU after deciding to vote for their OWN interests instead of the interest of others. What she fails to understand is that there is overlap between the interests of Trump supporters and the interests of those "others" that she implies.

Trump voters are not voting to send us back to the fucking stone ages. So yeah, they can support Trump and still like the pictures of your shitty dogs and not immediately be labeled delusional hypocrites.

AND VOTING FOR THE INTERESTS OF EVERYBODY ELSE WHILE NEGLECTING OUR OWN IS WHAT FUCKING GOT US HERE.

IDIOCY IS A CHOICE. GROW THE FUCK UP.
good, one less retard on the council.
Now that shes not working on the school board maybe she will find the time to open up her home to some nice refugees...
Just look at her face. She's a Hillary supporter through and through.

If there were more ugly women in America, Hillary would have won.
Another self-hating Caucasian.

On the upside, she won't be passing these views onto the young minds in her district. 
From the comments

> It is indeed fortuitous that this depraved and toxic individual has done parents, students and taxpayers the great service of removing herself. She has unwittingly done her part to help make America great again.
That's what she gets for being an idiot. He entire argument as to why she was mad  were  lies. If she actually took the time to do some research about Trump instead of listening to the MSM she would of discovered the truth. Smh dummy 
I dip my toast in this, and I eat it.
We need to do better screening for mental illness for those who are tasked with teaching our youth.
Just your average school board member. This is how we ended up with an entire generation brainwashed.
Too bad this is only an isolated incident. More of these people should quit before another generation is lost.
I guess you could say she made a POOR decision.

The 2nd Greatest Living American (Tom Brady)  gave so much energy to the DJT spirit bomb on election day that the crooked mainstream refs (confirmed by wikileaks to be colluding with the Clinton campaign) punished his alma mater, the UofM (aka ground-zero a la butthurt).
What is this the 15th we've won Michigan!
I thought only Wisconsin was going to have a recount? But i assume this means Michigan has had a recount and Trump won? Im abit out of the loop.
We were going to be a Bernie state if not for HRC, which I'm glad for because we are committed 1000% to MAGA
Finally! Now I can rest assured that my vote made a difference. MAGA!
I guess that makes them okay...

She is going to keep giving hill shills false hope because they keep donating to her as long as they think there might be a chance.

Funny thing is, Jill roasted tf out of Hillary during the election, now she's taking Hillary supporters money while totally misleading them. Jill is a savage lol.
Good, drag it through court, missing the deadline for paying and dragging the process out for many weeks.
How much are they paying her?
Here comes the virtue signaling "we are trying to fight for all Americans" bullshit. 

edit: Hey cool she kind of did it! https://twitter.com/DrJillStein/status/803640959087050752
The Druid has been corrupted by the fel.
Go home and tend to your greens, plant lady.
Look lady you scammed your money now take it and go home.
Bless her heart
Window dressing. So she can keep most of the money and not get charged with fraud.  
I love how they keep saying his current vote numbers are "unofficial", as if subliminally telling the reader that they need to be recounted.

The bias is so fucking strong. 
She's trying to make them miss the federal electoral vote deadline of Dec. 13, so their electoral votes aren't counted at all, and Trump wins by less than 300 EV.
Mo money
Her long convoluted story will end in "just send more money", just like the girl in the parking lot who "lost her purse"
She is like that terrible wife who files for divorce, not because she wants to be rid of you, but because she enjoys seeing you dragged through court. 
Liberals: Trump is claiming without evidence that 3 million people voted illegally, what a crack pot! He is destroying our country!

Liberals later on: Just because there is no evidence of hacking doesn't mean we shouldn't be recounting the vote to make sure it's okay!
Delay...Delay...Delay...
That's all she is trying to pull so these states miss the deadline. She got her recount but she wants it hand counted for some reason.
Wow plant lady has gone mad 
**Jill Stein, mega whine child of the left.**

**Thinks it's funny to con big money.** 

**then run off with her theft.**
As I understand it if recounts are not finished by the date the electoral college votes, those states electoral votes are left out.Jill has done everything necessary to drag this process out...then only a handful of faithless electors could choose to vote for Hilary instead of Trump. Once that deed is done Clinton would be the President. But u all can just keep making fun and not taking her challenge for the brilliant chess move that it is. Wake up folks there's a coup in the air.  Edit: and its for sure every ballot possible will be argued over to prolong the recount. 
This doesn't sound like her. I think she's scared. They payed her to push through these rigged recounts, and she screwed it up. Now who knows what they'll do to her, or to her family.

#PrayForJill
Guys give her a break. Soros implanted one of those mind bombs from suicide squad in her head. 
She filed a suit in Pennsylvania yesterday too because she couldn't get enough people to submit affidavits.
She should ask for more money.

[Pepe laughs]
You are gonna need more money Jill, $3.5M to Wisconsin by end of day.  
"The decentralized nature of Wisconsin‚Äôs voting system, and the fact that the equipment in question is not connected to the internet, makes it difficult to see how there could have been a widespread attack, said Wisconsin Election Commission administrator Mike Haas."
She holds zero credibility now. Even my liberal friends are calling her retarded
I can't knock her hustle. She just scammed gullible Democrats out of **7 million dollars**. That's hilarious.

Based plant lady lives!
Money is not an issue for Stein: Federal election contribution loophole allows Soros to pay recount costs w no limit: recount funds given to a campaign are not considered a "contribution" per Title 11 ¬ß 100.91 of the Federal code. 
Stein posturing to avoid the incoming hot cocoa and salt-stained iPhones that will be hurled at her by disillusioned (conned) donors to the "cause".
OK, this is actually a dangerous move, and here is why:


The idea is not that the recount would switch the electoral college from being for Trump to being for Clinton, the idea is to effectively temporarily remove those delegates from the totals by effectively tying up electors when they have to cast their votes on December 19.


We have Wisconsin: 10, Michigan 16 and Pennsylvania 20.


If you remove those from Trump's total (even just temporarily), it puts us at 260.


What this means that when December 19 rolls along, when the electors are supposed to cast their votes, some electors might abstain from voting since the results of a recount is still pending or even casting their votes for Clinton which is not illegal in Pennsylvania (elector is not bound by law to vote for the candidate who won the state) which will effectively cede who picks the president to the House and Senate.


Hope I don't sound like a concern troll.
What an absolute idiot this woman is.  Squandering the money from these donations already
isn't she going to pay 3.5 million dollars today?
What an unpredictable and wholely shocking coincidence.
Let them recount..  We would get to see them all cry again after Trump gets even more votes.  He won, even with all the people voting that didn't have a right to vote.  He won, even with all the democrats trying to slow the gop voters down, he won.  


It's been a tough year for Jill. Maybe she just needs to get laid? What's Billy up to this week?
OK JILL YOU CAN SUE FOR EXACTLY 4.6 MIL $$

NOW WHAT??
She can't count hands because we don't use that blue ink like they do in Iraq!

;)
Batty old plant lady has been smoking too many plants! 
Saying whatever she has to in order to raise more funds.
She took too much LDS.
Jack n Jill went up the hilll... and Jill demanded a HANDJOB
She's bought and paid for - this is not her decision - she is doing what she is told to do by the same people who gave her the 5m in 3 days to fund this political suicide.
She has to keep up the guise that she really cares about these recounts or else she could be sued for fraud, or worse.  Would she like to keep ALL the money, minus the filing fees, well sure.  But she's willing to part with some to play the game.
She is a lightweight.  The real hypocrisy here is HRC and the Dems
 Clinton organization has joined the recount effort, will participate in the recount effort and will consequently contribute resources to the recount effort, and that it would be unfair to say that they are aggregate with the recount effort.

Imagine a surgical oncologist, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thoroughly reviewed your charts. It is my professional opinion that you do not have a brain tumor. Your headaches are caused by hypertension. I recommend that you cut back on your caffeine intake. However, since I see here that your kid‚Äôs pet‚Äôs veterinarian has determined that a brain tumor is the only good explanation for your headaches, we‚Äôre going to go forward with an exploratory procedure. Just to be prudent.‚Äù

Tricking liberals out of their money is a lucrative business. 
Why is the goal now $7million? Oh right, a fool and his money...
Bet she asks for more money to do that.
She believes that vaccines cause autism and wifi causes cancer.

She's always been off her rocker.
if people are throwing money at you, you better be pretending to at least be doing some work.
Give them all the rope they want! Theyll never stop hanging themselves. 
Good, fucking waste your money I don't care 
More like she is trying to hold onto the money.
Its just posturing to make her seem like she actually cares. Once again it will fail but she can at least say "Hey I tried guys!" after she runs off with 5 mil.
Bitch needs to get Trumped. 
Based Druid Grandma has smoked TOO MUCH of her homegrown...
#ARE WE GOING TO WIN 3 TIMES? BUT MR TRUMP! I AM GETTING TIRED OF WINNING (im not)
She setting herself up to get whacked by angry dem donors. 
Dirty Commies want to hand count what they covet.
Seriously...what the hell is she trying to accomplish?
She's wasting all of her money in one state.
I still think this is an elaboratre money grab. The more the left see her pull shit the more likely they are too donate and then BAM! NO REFUNDS.
Why not start ANOTHER fundraiser that will ultimately go to your party's pockets, granny? It worked on the schmucks before, why not again. 
You gotta have something in order to lose it, friend. 
Can someone help me?

I need to archive a webpage but it won't allow me to.
https://jillstein.nationbuilder.com/recount

The page I want to archive is after clicking $5 > Next (using dummy info).

Is there a way to do that? Thank you!!

The longer she prolongs it the more money she will get.  This is the green party blue print.
She is high as fuck 
She was to make look believeable before she steaks the money
Why stop when the donations are still coming?  
Plus we get to watch them lose a third time.
Druids can take many forms, we never should have thought she was decent. 
She's trying to make herself relevant.  
>~~Jill Stein has officially lost her mind.~~

The check has officially cleared.


How exactly does one "sue" in this instance?

I thought the act meant you had to demonstrate a wrong against you in some way that only money could somehow solve.  
This is, in large part, because the Greens know the Dems have absolutely fucked themselves up for the near-medium future.

Yound people, especially those who wanter Sanders, are completely disiullusioned with the Democrats and certainly many of them won't vote Republicans. Some may have this year, but in 2020 Trump won't be as much of a protest vote, so they'll want something new.

The Greens are positioning themselves to be that new thing. They're doing similar in the UK (and across Europe).

By openly 'trying' to force a recount she shows she 'gives a shit about fairness' and that she's 'fighting the system'. That will gain her a lot of support among the ones on the losing side who now despise the Democrats.
Is it possible she has some evidence of fraud we don't know about? This is going to be interesting regardless. 
I bet that have count would be expensive.. üòâ We should get the libs behind this. 
Jill the Shill. Bought by Soros.
Don't hate on Jill Stein, she trolled a lot of idiotic regressives out of their cashish. Sure she is a huge cunt, but I gotta respect her for that. 
Stein doesn't care about the results, she and everyone knows Trump won, But she wants a transparent electoral system..

And anyone sane with some form of sense and belief in democracy would support this.

This can't and won't change any results for President Trump.

It might give the green party some extra funding next election in the specific state though.
But that's about it as far as results go.




Lost her mind?

No. She did exactly what she wanted.  She raised Millions and then didn't have to go through with ANY recounts.
Trump may be the first person to take the mainstream media head on and win. Very impressive!
So essentially...

Sources say there are no sources!üê∏

He sure as hell got my vote. And I wrote myself in on the rest of the down ballot. Fuck those cucks.

This Train has No Brakes!

And it's cold in Michigan! Can someone please get me a coat! üòÇ
I wish we could have thorough recount of California, Florida and any other state where there are sanctuary cities. Really expose the DNC for the snakes they really are.
Im so tried of winning and he isnt even prez yet!
ItsHappening.gif
Man the cucks must be so mad
The 2nd Greatest Living American (Tom Brady)  gave so much energy to the DJT spirit bomb on election day that the crooked mainstream refs (confirmed by wikileaks to be colluding with the Clinton campaign) punished his alma mater, the UofM (aka ground-zero a la butthurt).
What is this the 15th we've won Michigan!
I thought only Wisconsin was going to have a recount? But i assume this means Michigan has had a recount and Trump won? Im abit out of the loop.
We were going to be a Bernie state if not for HRC, which I'm glad for because we are committed 1000% to MAGA
Finally! Now I can rest assured that my vote made a difference. MAGA!
I guess that makes them okay...
Michigan **is** a great state.

Great Lakes, Great State!
I'm already getting tired of winning all the dang time. 
‚ÄúWe're going to win so much. You're going to get tired of winning. 

You‚Äôre going to say, ‚ÄòPlease Mr. President, I have a headache. Please, don't win so much. This is getting terrible.‚Äô 

And I'm going to say, ‚ÄòNo, we have to make America great again.‚Äô 

You're gonna say, ‚ÄòPlease.‚Äô 

I said, ‚ÄòNope, nope. We're gonna keep winning.‚Äô
And *I* helped!
But I'm tired of winning.  MAKE IT STOP.  NO MORE WINNING.  IM DROWING IN SUCCESS
Well. They said that bill, Chelsea and Hillary all will have nothing to do with the foundation for the time hillary is president.
They do not want rich people to become politicians.  They want politicians to become rich people.

The lady interviewing Stein did NOT let her out of there easy, that's for sure.
Martha Maccallum asked whether Soros gave an online donation, Stein said if he did it was probably $45 and she would certainly return it.  

Uh huh, sure he did. Nice to know he keeps such loose change in his wallet.

Casey wishes he could call himself a sell-out, but he's been a tool for product placement since day 1. 
That's one Goblin Trump won't be getting in bed with.
I wonder how his face got like that.
where is he standing.
Is that the guy that played the senators son in Sin City?
Fucking hell this is laugh out loud funny. GOBLIN!
Casey Neistat is great!  Has he specifically done anything to support idiocy on his channel?  I actually find it real entertaining.

She's a member of the green party. She lost her mind a long time ago, friend!
Jillshill where the fuck where you when the dnc was throwing away Bernie votes?
She is going to keep giving hill shills false hope because they keep donating to her as long as they think there might be a chance. This is the best Jill has ever done raising money, she could barely get her broke communist fan base to donate during the election, so she is going to milk this gravy train as long as it lasts. Funny thing is, Jill roasted tf out of Hillary during the election, now she's taking Hillary supporters money while totally misleading them. Jill is a savage lol.
Good, drag it through court, missing the deadline for paying and dragging the process out for many weeks.
How much are they paying her?
Here comes the virtue signaling "we are trying to fight for all Americans" bullshit. 

edit: Hey cool she kind of did it! https://twitter.com/DrJillStein/status/803640959087050752
The Druid has been corrupted by the fel.
Go home and tend to your greens, plant lady.
Look lady you scammed your money now take it and go home.
Bless her heart
Window dressing. So she can keep most of the money and not get charged with fraud.  
I love how they keep saying his current vote numbers are "unofficial", as if subliminally telling the reader that they need to be recounted.

The bias is so fucking strong. 
She's trying to make them miss the federal electoral vote deadline of Dec. 13, so their electoral votes aren't counted at all, and Trump wins by less than 300 EV.
Mo money
Her long convoluted story will end in "just send more money", just like the girl in the parking lot who "lost her purse"
She is like that terrible wife who files for divorce, not because she wants to be rid of you, but because she enjoys seeing you dragged through court. 
Liberals: Trump is claiming without evidence that 3 million people voted illegally, what a crack pot! He is destroying our country!

Liberals later on: Just because there is no evidence of hacking doesn't mean we shouldn't be recounting the vote to make sure it's okay!
Delay...Delay...Delay...
That's all she is trying to pull so these states miss the deadline. She got her recount but she wants it hand counted for some reason.
Wow plant lady has gone mad 
**Jill Stein, mega whine child of the left.**

**Thinks it's funny to con big money.** 

**then run off with her theft.**
As I understand it if recounts are not finished by the date the electoral college votes, those states electoral votes are left out.Jill has done everything necessary to drag this process out...then only a handful of faithless electors could choose to vote for Hilary instead of Trump. Once that deed is done Clinton would be the President. But u all can just keep making fun and not taking her challenge for the brilliant chess move that it is. Wake up folks there's a coup in the air.  Edit: and its for sure every ballot possible will be argued over to prolong the recount. 
This doesn't sound like her. I think she's scared. They payed her to push through these rigged recounts, and she screwed it up. Now who knows what they'll do to her, or to her family.

#PrayForJill
Guys give her a break. Soros implanted one of those mind bombs from suicide squad in her head. 
She filed a suit in Pennsylvania yesterday too because she couldn't get enough people to submit affidavits.
She should ask for more money.

[Pepe laughs]
You are gonna need more money Jill, $3.5M to Wisconsin by end of day.  
"The decentralized nature of Wisconsin‚Äôs voting system, and the fact that the equipment in question is not connected to the internet, makes it difficult to see how there could have been a widespread attack, said Wisconsin Election Commission administrator Mike Haas."
She holds zero credibility now. Even my liberal friends are calling her retarded
I can't knock her hustle. She just scammed gullible Democrats out of **7 million dollars**. That's hilarious.

Based plant lady lives!
Money is not an issue for Stein: Federal election contribution loophole allows Soros to pay recount costs w no limit: recount funds given to a campaign are not considered a "contribution" per Title 11 ¬ß 100.91 of the Federal code. 
Stein posturing to avoid the incoming hot cocoa and salt-stained iPhones that will be hurled at her by disillusioned (conned) donors to the "cause".
OK, this is actually a dangerous move, and here is why:


The idea is not that the recount would switch the electoral college from being for Trump to being for Clinton, the idea is to effectively temporarily remove those delegates from the totals by effectively tying up electors when they have to cast their votes on December 19.


We have Wisconsin: 10, Michigan 16 and Pennsylvania 20.


If you remove those from Trump's total (even just temporarily), it puts us at 260.


What this means that when December 19 rolls along, when the electors are supposed to cast their votes, some electors might abstain from voting since the results of a recount is still pending or even casting their votes for Clinton which is not illegal in Pennsylvania (elector is not bound by law to vote for the candidate who won the state) which will effectively cede who picks the president to the House and Senate.


Hope I don't sound like a concern troll.
What an absolute idiot this woman is.  Squandering the money from these donations already
isn't she going to pay 3.5 million dollars today?
What an unpredictable and wholely shocking coincidence.
Let them recount..  We would get to see them all cry again after Trump gets even more votes.  He won, even with all the people voting that didn't have a right to vote.  He won, even with all the democrats trying to slow the gop voters down, he won.  


It's been a tough year for Jill. Maybe she just needs to get laid? What's Billy up to this week?
OK JILL YOU CAN SUE FOR EXACTLY 4.6 MIL $$

NOW WHAT??
She can't count hands because we don't use that blue ink like they do in Iraq!

;)
Batty old plant lady has been smoking too many plants! 
Saying whatever she has to in order to raise more funds.
She took too much LDS.
Jack n Jill went up the hilll... and Jill demanded a HANDJOB
She's bought and paid for - this is not her decision - she is doing what she is told to do by the same people who gave her the 5m in 3 days to fund this political suicide.
She has to keep up the guise that she really cares about these recounts or else she could be sued for fraud, or worse.  Would she like to keep ALL the money, minus the filing fees, well sure.  But she's willing to part with some to play the game.
She is a lightweight.  The real hypocrisy here is HRC and the Dems
 Clinton organization has joined the recount effort, will participate in the recount effort and will consequently contribute resources to the recount effort, and that it would be unfair to say that they are aggregate with the recount effort.

Imagine a surgical oncologist, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thoroughly reviewed your charts. It is my professional opinion that you do not have a brain tumor. Your headaches are caused by hypertension. I recommend that you cut back on your caffeine intake. However, since I see here that your kid‚Äôs pet‚Äôs veterinarian has determined that a brain tumor is the only good explanation for your headaches, we‚Äôre going to go forward with an exploratory procedure. Just to be prudent.‚Äù

Tricking liberals out of their money is a lucrative business. 
Why is the goal now $7million? Oh right, a fool and his money...
Bet she asks for more money to do that.
She believes that vaccines cause autism and wifi causes cancer.

She's always been off her rocker.
if people are throwing money at you, you better be pretending to at least be doing some work.
Give them all the rope they want! Theyll never stop hanging themselves. 
Good, fucking waste your money I don't care 
More like she is trying to hold onto the money.
Its just posturing to make her seem like she actually cares. Once again it will fail but she can at least say "Hey I tried guys!" after she runs off with 5 mil.
Bitch needs to get Trumped.

#ARE WE GOING TO WIN 3 TIMES? BUT MR TRUMP! I AM GETTING TIRED OF WINNING (im not)

Seriously...what the hell is she trying to accomplish?
She's wasting all of her money in one state.
I still think this is an elaboratre money grab. The more the left see her pull shit the more likely they are too donate and then BAM! NO REFUNDS.
Why not start ANOTHER fundraiser that will ultimately go to your party's pockets, granny? It worked on the schmucks before, why not again. 
You gotta have something in order to lose it, friend. 
Can someone help me?

I need to archive a webpage but it won't allow me to.
https://jillstein.nationbuilder.com/recount

The page I want to archive is after clicking $5 > Next (using dummy info).

Is there a way to do that? Thank you!!

The longer she prolongs it the more money she will get.  This is the green party blue print.
She is high as fuck 
She was to make look believeable before she steaks the money
Why stop when the donations are still coming?  
Plus we get to watch them lose a third time.
Druids can take many forms, we never should have thought she was decent. 
She's trying to make herself relevant.  
>~~Jill Stein has officially lost her mind.~~

The check has officially cleared.


How exactly does one "sue" in this instance?

I thought the act meant you had to demonstrate a wrong against you in some way that only money could somehow solve.  
This is, in large part, because the Greens know the Dems have absolutely fucked themselves up for the near-medium future.

Yound people, especially those who wanter Sanders, are completely disiullusioned with the Democrats and certainly many of them won't vote Republicans. Some may have this year, but in 2020 Trump won't be as much of a protest vote, so they'll want something new.

The Greens are positioning themselves to be that new thing. They're doing similar in the UK (and across Europe).

By openly 'trying' to force a recount she shows she 'gives a shit about fairness' and that she's 'fighting the system'. That will gain her a lot of support among the ones on the losing side who now despise the Democrats.
Is it possible she has some evidence of fraud we don't know about? This is going to be interesting regardless. 
I bet that have count would be expensive.. üòâ We should get the libs behind this. 
Jill the Shill. Bought by Soros.
Don't hate on Jill Stein, she trolled a lot of idiotic regressives out of their cashish. Sure she is a huge cunt, but I gotta respect her for that. 
Stein doesn't care about the results, she and everyone knows Trump won, But she wants a transparent electoral system..

And anyone sane with some form of sense and belief in democracy would support this.

This can't and won't change any results for President Trump.

It might give the green party some extra funding next election in the specific state though.
But that's about it as far as results go.




Lost her mind?

No. She did exactly what she wanted.  She raised Millions and then didn't have to go through with ANY recounts.

spez: [Here's the tweet that did it](https://twitter.com/DirtyMouseBalls/status/764917028025053185)
I absolutely fucking love Tucker's face of utter disbelief as he lets these morons spew their hatespeech before he sets them straight. You can tell his brain is doing its best to play devil's advocate to try and understand and accept what these morons say, but thankfully he realizes these people are so far gone and can't be reasoned with. Then he destroys them with facts - usually their own words they try to spin. And when he is called a white supremacist, he smiles knowing the moron had no more ammunition.
I swear tucker's show is based off of domreddit -  THE_DONALD
and it's great
That was difficult to watch.
But but but but you're a white supremacist Tucker okie doke.

I think he sent out the initial tweet when he saw Somalian in the headline and the shooter was white. He thought this was a white on back thing, the dumbass didn't have a CLUE that most Somalians are muslim. Like that never crossed his mind, he saw Somalian and just saw a black person. Then when it blew up he had to dig the heels in and double down, only to look that idiot we already knew he was!
Can't stand him and his stupidity.

Cereals are in fact one of the worst things you could eat. Aside from the fact that they are usually mostly sugar, even if they contain zero sugar it's just corn. GM corn at that. Lot's of it. It's basically the same feed they give to farm animals. Make breakfast great again! Stop eating kellogg's products -- and all cereals if you can.

Ahh yes, Kelloggs... the company famous for a cereal designed to stop boys from masturbating.  You also pushed for circumcision for that purpose as well.
I never once remember seeing any Kelloggs ads on Breitbart
time to get hashtag boycottKellogs to number one on twitter before they censor it
Their cereal is overpriced anyway, $5.00 a box, get real I can get an oversized bag of generic for $3.00

Our timeline has the best Pence.
Kaine was talking about the violence from the cop who shot the terrorist 
##**LOOSE TRIGGER KAINE IS CREEPING EVERYBODY OUT**
All this time I thought it was Backed The Fuck Off. Oh well that works too!
I was about to say..... Pence is on fire with every tweet in the last week.

Now I see it is a parody account, but still funny.
Kaine reminds me of Dan Quayle, only he's not a VP.
I'm sure that good ole Tim was referring to the gun violence that was committed against the terrorist since he was shot.
Imagine the scene:

Tim Kaine sitting in whatever office he is in, 1st floor ex-campaign office. He types away the doozy of a tweet that we see above. He's content happen to virtue signal to the few people that even realize he exists. Then the notification dings, the response tweet loads, and...


As the light from the screen reaches his eyes, a shockwave rips forth from the screen. Not a Michael Bay explosion, well at least without the flames and smoke, but just pure force. Kaine is ripped from his seat and shot out the neighboring window, the furniture is pulverized, the doors torn from the hinges, eardrums burst. Kaine speeds through plate glass and lands on his ass before he skids away. Utterly,

BLOWN. THE. FUCK. OUT.
Thus the Silver Fox utterly destroys Creepy Kaine TWICE!

Also need to harshly punish those who voted without ID, or those who facilitate others to vote without ID.

Fear of punishment is an effective deterrent. Use the laws.
I don't understand how you can vote without showing some sort of ID. Like, how do you prove that you are who you claim to be? Or that you are a citizen?
I can not fathom how voter ID laws are a bad thing. I just don't understand, I don't even begin to get how they are "racist." 
Most hurt by requiring an ID to vote?  Democrats who are afraid of losing votes...
The three types of people we don't want participating in the voting process anyway.

I've been saying this for a long time.

Too stupid? Too lazy? Too illegal? Too criminal? **Too bad.**
And apparently liberals think the minority community is all those things. 

Don't they say voter id laws unfairly impact minorities? 
If you don't have your shit together enough to get an ID you are in no position to influence the direction of our country
The title should be MOST HELPED, as those "Illegals, criminals and lazy people" would be shown what they need - an actual physical real experience of abiding by laws and moving on with their lives for the better.
I also think we should use election ink.
AKA 90% of democrats :)
The lazy weren't going to go out to get their voter ID or vote anyways so that doesn't really hurt them.
We need fucking voter id laws. This is our best chance!!!
But most of the people too lazy to go get an ID are too lazy to vote
Just enact a law requiring voter ID and the states will figure out how to bus the "underprivileged" to the ID card facility. Problem solved.
An ID is required to vote in PR. I got mine in about 20 minutes one Tuesday afternoon. Lazy fucks are lazy.

Oh man don't forget operation fast and furious.
I would never want a President who repeatedly said he "heard about it on the news".

I expect Presidents to know about things before they are on the news. Especially if they are scandals. I would hope people give him the heads up. Or he has informants. Or that he was behind it. 
Otherwise it makes you look like an idiot. And he's an idiot if he didn't understand that.

Sheriff Clarke for head of Homeland Security. He is the one. Let Trump know we want him and meme him in please!
 -  Fine the landlords for renting to such people
 - Fine the businesses for hiring such people

START IN CALIFORNIA.

Make an example of them.

If we can get employers and landlords in California to suffer consequences, then we can do that anywhere.
OOOOOuch! Taste THAT, colleges.
The Feds can just rescind all federal funding to the city and the county. They can ban the use of federal funds at universities and schools within city borders.

Does no one remember what happened when Berkeley tried to kick out the Marine recruitment station? The fed threatened exactly the above, and the city folded instantly.
Badass---love him!
Criminal sanctions for Congress for harboring Pocahontas! 
Looks like the Sheriff got the job.  This is almost too much winning.  Nah.
We're gonna need a lot of new mayors in the coming days, folks.
Fuck that. 

**Treason** against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their **Enemies**, giving them **Aid and Comfort**.

Not reporting sounds pretty fucking comforting to me.
"knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation;"

The law he's referring to
Clark is such a boss. 
Legit question - what should one do if they suspect that someone they work with or live around is either harboring aliens or are aliens themselves?? Especially if they're on friendly terms. 
As a Border Patrol Agent, we don't even charge felons who we catch smuggling aliens with 8 USC 1324, so how do you expect to charge others with it? The reality down here.
Out! Out! Out!  Get them outta here!

Obama couldn't negotiate this, but Trump can. I've heard he tells the companies about the coming tax cuts, and regulation cuts and energy and healthcare, and so they get convinced. Those are solutions Obama wouldn't even consider so he can't make anything happen.
This is so fucking spicy 
All political candidates since I can remember have campaigned on saving jobs or creating new ones. Trump is actually fucking doing it. I am in a state of shock and pure excitement at the same time. 
This post is amazing. High 5.
He isn't presidential since he's getting shit done 
still not tired of winning!
I'm going to make a video on this!

Hmm... Just going to need an office now.
I feel so ripped off now!
yeah, make it loook like you are doing work, while not doing any
This post, um.. it almost sounds like you're talking about typical political red-tape and brakes on the system. Much like a parking break that's rusted on and can't be released. 

#THIS TRUMP TRAIN HAS NO BREAKS
That's because the politicians' friends are usually paid a lot of our tax dollars to do these "feasibility studies".
Well, it wouldn't really be for free since we pay taxes. But, I could stand for not paying for it twice.
I'll pay for all of California's. Still cheaper than the taxes here. Fucking commies
there are people that do not want to be identified, has nothing to do with voting, they have a right to remain anonymous.  But you should have to show id to vote.
100% agree I have never understood why you can't go down and get an id from the DMV for free. This completly eliminates any question. All you have to do is give the same type of address verification as if you were changing your address for your license. 
No fuck that, just make it mandatory. Get that shit yourselves. You've got 4 years to do so. Lots of luck!
Can't cost us more than a few F-35s, and securing our voting system would be way better national defense in the long run.
Yep. Like a birth certificate, just make it 20$ to get a new copy if you need one.

I try to bring this up to my pro-Hillary friends but they won't hear it. I know how crazy it sounds. I look like the idiot discussing it, but I do believe this spirit cooking shit is bizarre and real

Just to clarify. This is NOT "satan-worship", an accusation I have seen bandied about in quite a few places.

These people will straight face tell you that they are NOT doing Satan worshipping, and they won't even be lying. 

They are worshipping Moloch, which is a pre-canninite, child sacrifice demanding deity that originated out of Mesopotamia BEFORE judaism. 

These are occult or pagan rituals, not Satan worship. Satan is small potatoes to them.
Can we ignore this Spirit Cooking shit and focus on Pizzagate? 
Honestly, I'm not interested in going down the rabbit hole here, but what motivates someone to get involved in this weird shit? Is it more elitist debauchery? Because it seems like something weirdo yuppies in Portland or Berkeley would do "for culture" or whatever.
What ever happened to the zero point energy alien shit or whatever was revealed in early Wikileaks dumps?

Unbelievable... this guy was talking Podesta and Soros 6 years before the rest of us. What a legend. 
yup brietbart had a heart attack after walking home from a night drinking wine...

hey now doesnt wine thin your blood much like an aspirin?
It gives me chills hearing him say that John Podesta is his mortal enemy, while accusing him of these nasty things and what happens? He winds up dead. These people need to be stopped.
Breitbart's body should be exhumed and a new autopsy conducted - if someone is brave enough to do it.  The last guy didn't live too long afterwards.
Bannon will avenge.

So shall we all.
We are all Andrew Breitbart now, ladies and gentlemen.

Breitbart was also onto a massive story on Obama.

He said it would tear 'the whole thing down' (IIRC).

He was killed before he could release it.

Hopefully when Trump becomes president people will have the courage to come forward and speak out.

Funny.  Why hasn't Ben ever mentioned any of the Pizzagate revelations...ü§î
When I still had my Motorola RAZR flip phone back in the day (was a college student), I actually called Andrew Breitbart's mobile number.  (I was FB friends with him.)  It was regarding Meghan McCain's visit to my university...

Mr. Breitbart was a very polite and helpful character over the phone.  [I never met him in real life, so I cannot say from this point of view...]

When they are a Constitutional Amendment making Trudeaus illegal in 2012, is considered an egalitarian
I found a study here: http://adcbeta.bmj.com/content/81/3/257.full that shows the correlation for the height of a child based on the height of the parents.  Based on the tables and charts in the study, it's much more likely that Justin's dad was 6' 3" (like Castro) instead of 5' 8" (like his "biological" father):

If Margaret (5' 6"/167.6 cm or 62nd percentile for height) is the mother and Pierre (5' 8"/172.7 cm or 35th percentile for height) is the father, then Justin's predicted height would be: 5' 10"/177cm or 48.5th percentile for height. **He's 4 inches taller than predicted.**

Also, based on these studies, it would be extraordinary for Justin's height to be more than 14 cm (5.5 in) away from the mean height of his parents 170 cm (5' 7") Therefore, if these were his parents, it would be extraordinary for him to be taller than 184 cm (6 ft 1/2 inch). **He's an inch and a half outside of the extreme range for potential height.**

On the other hand, if Fidel Castro (6' 3"/190.5 cm or 83rd percentile) was his father, then Justin's predicted height would be: 6' 1"/185 cm or 72nd percentile for height. He's 6' 2".

In short, if Treadu's mom is 5' 6" and he is 6' 2", his father was most likely in the range of 6' 3". It would be extremely unusual for his father to be only 5' 8". Combined with his striking similarities to Fidel Castro, his mother's well known infidelity and her visit to Cuba around the time he would have been conceived, I'm convinced that Fidel [Castro is the father](http://conservativefans.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/img_2449.jpg).   
The jaw line and nose are identical 
But how? Justin was born 5 years before before Pierre and his wife ever even met Castro.
Liberal democrats have never gotten past their need to sterotype  and demean black people. 
It's amazing to me how detached the left is from the people they think they represent. Not only do the REAL Americans interviewed here think the left's talking points are ridiculous, some think the assumptions made about them are racist themselves!
The liberal left always think they know what's best for everyone.
This is brilliant.

Nothing showcasing how the left really feels about their favorite demographic.

It really is insulting how the left talks about the demographics they choose to "enrich"

We need more of this...go talk to SJW on collage campus, then go talk to the demographic they think they know best for....

I mean it really is insulting to hear college students talk like this about...well anyone...maybe except for themselves.
Wow, their racism is fucking mind blowing.. 
the leftist liberal pukes we see at the start of the video are the same types who will go to africa on "voluntourism" trips paid for by mommy and daddy. you see them all over the place, they post pictures of themselves holding little black babies or riding an elephant. they will then preach and brag to everyone about how "inclusive" and "understanding" they are of other "minorities". 
Awesome video
This video is pure gold.

I mean, I didn't even knew that you are not required to show an ID when voting in some US states until the elections, and when I heard the reasons, it made me sick. I'm from Europe, everyone here has ID, majority, minority, it doesn't matter, you have to have ID. Especially when it's something important like voting.
If voter ID laws are unconstitutional, then so is providing your ID to exercise your second amendment right to buy a gun. 
Wow, that one little girl saying she didn't think black people knew how to use the internet properly. WTF. It's insane to me how Trump supporters are deemed racist and yet these white, liberal kids, many of whom (not all) have huge tuitions paid for by their parents are going around playing crusader for the black man and woman. 

Beta men playing crusader for women.
Straight people playing crusader for gay people.

So really, the left is perpetuating the stereotype that only a straight, white male can heal the ailments of a minority. Whereas the right is like, work hard and figure it the fuck out. You're our pal if you're a decent person and we will help someone out if they need some assistance and expect them to do the same in kind. 
Holy fuck those white peoples were incredibly ignorant, and what's worse is they think that they aren't being racist in their assumptions. The best part is that the black people interviewed NEVER called them racist. 
Its racist against the left. Without fraud, illegal voters, foreign money and all of that they stand no chance. Their platform is garbage. 
ACTUAL RACISM
Fantastic video. Keep up the good works Pedes!
#Fucking privileged black men.
#Ignorantlibs
The left is so stupid it's hilarious. If they ever worked a real job outside of the lib/academic echo chamber, they'd have more respect for their fellow Americans. And maybe then they wouldn't judge their intelligence by the color of their skin. 
 This is hilarious they should be to the top dumb liberals  are the real racists.
This is the most hilarious shit i've seen the entire election
Spread this like wildfire. 
I love how these kids assume black folks are felons and don't have access to the internet.

Jesus Christ.

These children have probably never had an conversation with a black person in their entire lives.
Libs are crazy but how many dark skinned Americans vote Democrat and don't know they're been used by globalists?
This needs to be at the front of r/all to show liberals they are the true racist, and completely fucking stupid.
The left is right, racism is well and alive lol
Liberals are totally racist. Ha, ha that one libtard said "these type of people." Doesn't that sound racist? What about driver's licenses? Did anyone ever say that making someone get a driver's license in order to drive a car is racist?
"like, black people can't figure out the internet and can't find the DMV"

**WHO THE FUCK DO THESE LIBERALS THINK THEY ARE? DO THEY ACTUALLY THINK BLACK PEOPLE ARE STUPID?**
The black man was fired and the white woman was not. 
Everybody nose why Wolf Blitzer is not going anywhere.
Look at the hair... They are the same people...

Makes sense. 
That is not a man who has just been offered a job.
i just put $100 on NO for Romney
Trump *never* forgets who his enemies are, and he is not afraid to confront them rather than try to grovel and appease them like Falsedeau. The firing squad he organized for the MSM shows that. And he's worked all his life with sociopaths and rats and cunning people who would stab him in the back for a buck. He's got Romney's number, don't worry. I would be disappointed if he lets Romney near the executive, but I am willing to trust he knows what he's doing if it happens.

#Uhh
Trump just likes to see him grovel. No way Romney gets the job. 
lol, he's sucking up so much.

I wonder how much longer Trump will lead him on for.

I think Romney was trying to do the rumored apology with out losing too much face.  I think Trump told him not to grovel in his apology.  I think Romney has the job.
Look at his demeanor. There's no way he's getting a position. After he called Trump a fraud, there's no way Trump will forget. That said, he'll definitely get the job and I'm sure Trump will be there to keep a handle on things.

Step 4: Shitpost in support of that position on twitter.

Step 5: ???????????????????????????????????

Step 6: Profit from salt mine deposits.

Just MAGA things.
They fall for it every time. So what they're going to do now is try to defend flag burning by showing anti-American protests, making them look like complete morons. All because, I guess, they think he doesn't know already that it's protected speech? Even though they're just falling into his trap of having something for him to use against them later.

Liberalism is a mental illness.

This is empirical, observable fact, not opinion.
#Liberals are just [phobophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobophobia)
I've been alluding to this for years. Phobophobism is just the way liberals try to control our speech. By controlling our speech, they can control out thoughts,  therefore our actions.
Milton Wolf is based as fuck.  He was all over the Hillary health shit.
This particular type of doublespeak goes back to a German cultural Marxist sociologist named Theodor Adorno. In his 1950 book "The Authoritarian Personality" he theorized that social conservatives who uphold traditional religious, patriotic or family values are actually mentally ill. 

Thus traditional values are "pathologized" and labels are applied such as "homophobia," equating disapproval of homosexual acts with insanity and what's more, a specific "anxiety/panic disorder." 

The same is applied to the plethora of other "phobias" slung around by today's leftists, such as transphobia, Islamophobia, xenophobia, etc. Language has real historical roots. Pay attention to the terms the media and academics use. It's intentional and is part of their conditioning.

https://youtu.be/G8pPbrbJJQs?t=4m20s
Whoa, actually this is big. Using this understanding of phobia pits mental health protection against the isms of today.

 It busts the islamophobic narrative out on grounds of protecting mental health. 
I never thought of it this way.

Can't wait to use this. 
But over at [[r/redacted]] they say when someone doesn't agree with you it's the only possible answer. Shit, even reddit admins have said as much. The only possible answer must is the Dr. is mentally ill and his website needs listed as "FAKE NEWS"! Spez, his buddies and a reddit default sub cannot be wrong. Pack it in boyz!
This x 100. When you tell people their rationally justified uneasiness towards, say, a particular religious community (we won't say which one ;) ) is actually an irrational unjustified mental illness, you're telling those people not to trust their own common sense.

Having accomplished that, you can manipulate them at will
Hahahahahahaha

The flag burner dude is basically a 6 year old with old wrinkly skin. 


**DON'T BE A PIG**
And he's right. Yes, it's known that Trump doesn't like flag-burning...but, he also knows it's considered free speech and he himself wouldn't be able to change it (regardless of the Senate or Supreme Court being able to). He's baiting the media and leftists to defend flag-burning and anti-Americanism, which will involve them showing footage of it (possibly from recent riots and protests where people are waving Mexican flags and signs that disparage America etc.) and make them look bad.  This will be going on while the left is pushing to try to overturn the election. In addition, the support Clinton had for the 2005 Flag Protection Act will come out. 


It's a set-up. 


They. Just. Don't. Fucking. Learn.

LMFAO
I feel like there must have been a guy working at  one of Trump's businesses that was always getting called to HR for amazing office pranks, and Trump was like "use your powers for good" and now he sits in a room all day finding ways to troll Clinton and libs.

I cringe hard at all the self-righteous comments over the right to burn the flag.
Part of the reason is that the mainstream media outlets are mega corporations. To keep a machine that big together and functioning, there has to be a *lot* of structure ‚Äî lots of departments, managers, meetings, approvals, etc. Because of this, major change in strategy or direction is *extremely* slow and difficult. They're stuck in a routine and have no choice but to keep doing what they've always done. 
The Flag Protection Act of 2005 was a proposed United States federal law introduced by Senators Bob Bennett (R-UT) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY). The law would have prohibited burning or otherwise destroying and damaging the US flag with the primary purpose of intimidation or inciting immediate violence. It called for a punishment of one year in jail and a fine of $100,000.[1][2][3]
We're approaching chess levels that shouldn't even be possible...
Maybe he can institute a law that all American flags are leased to people by 'Murica.  Therefore if you burn one, you destroyed U.S. Government property.  You know, kind of like the shit TiVo did with their crap.
I think I first got hooked on Trump when he posted his taco bowl tweet. 
As that a male or a female?
Typical liberal hypocrisy.
the fuck am i looking at? did chewbaca get a sex change or is that a strange new fungus?
Isn't that a tranny in real life?

you guys understand he does this for us, right? throws us big juicy peices of meat served up by SJWs. absolute cannon fodder!
Infinite-D Chess
I don't know what law can do about this. I believe the SCOTUS has already ruled that flag burning is protected speech under the 1st amendment.
Please explain to me how this was a trap.  Is he just spouting the same rhetoric as Killary to eventually build up a bank of media bias to expose them?  
One thing about mice, they can never get over their love of cheese

Bill Clinton is definitely a rapist.  No question.  In this little speech, Bill "I'm a rapist" Clinton is just letting you know he is coming to rape your kids, your wife, and maybe even you.  "Bill the rapist Clinton"  Bill-Clinton-Rapist-Rape-Child-Hillary-Allows-Bill-Clinton-to-rape
Haha just had to look it up as the Donald is number 1?! We need to work harder on getting bill past him in the cucked database!

They installed some extra layers of bullet proof glass it seems. The new hats look great, too.

He's irresistible. Even for the haters.

1) all three hats are on display, the red white and camo.

2) The Don is the one in control in front of the computer

3) Its dark out - hes been working his ass off

4) and most importantly, right in the foreground we see both the IN and OUT boxes empty, meaning he's done all the work for the day.

Trump: "I got your balls, now smile"
Mitt Romney looks scared shi*less
I hope he's like making him buy all his dinners and shiit.
Trump has Mittens' swollen balls in his hot fists, squeezing them like over-ripe peaches. Just as the photo was taken, Trump crushed them, whispering BTFO...

he's just abusing him at this point
Look at this white-cis fucking male!
I really think Trump's team needs some more [white males](https://i.sli.mg/GC5qgp.jpg).
So how long until the media make an Asian woman driver joke?

And how long until they realize making that joke is more racist and sexist than anything Trump has done?
Confirmed Chinese spy. Trump knows this so he brings her in close to keep an eye on her.
What are her actual views though?
Muh  triggers....
The fact that the MSM is not calling her a racist, confirms how racist the MSM is.
Just look at all that privilege. Disgusting.  Gays really better watch out now.    
He can't keep getting away with this! 
I remember the bitch fit they put up when they discovered she was Mitch McConnell's wife during his reelection.
She seems like a swamp dweller. Married to Mitch McConnell, her father owns the shipping company caught smuggling cocaine, ties to chinese president. This doesn't smell right.
but but muh narrative!!11!
The left hates asians because its proof that inequality is based mainly on culture. 
She's so misogynistic I can't stand it.
Really fucked to dig Mickey Rooney out of his grave for this.

Isn't she Mitch McConnell's wife?
WTF? No one better than this? Mitch McConnell's wife.
What happens if Bernie tries to bend the knee?
These people are useless.  They would rather tweet about a problem instead of picking up a phone like Trump and solving it.  Is the government out of touch,  nah it's the people who are out of touch.

> New York Times DEC. 7, 2005 - Senator Clinton, in Pander Mode
>     
> Hillary Clinton is co-sponsoring a bill to criminalize the burning of the American flag. Her supporters would characterize this as an attempt to find a middle way between those who believe that flag-burning is constitutionally protected free speech and those who want to ban it, even if it takes a constitutional amendment. Unfortunately, it looks to us more like a simple attempt to have it both ways.
>     
> Senator Clinton says she opposes a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag-burning. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that flag-burning was protected by the First Amendment. But her bill, which is sponsored by Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah, is clearly intended to put the issue back before the current, more conservative, Supreme Court in hopes of getting a turnaround.
>     
> It's hard to see this as anything but pandering -- there certainly isn't any urgent need to resolve the issue. Flag-burning hasn't been in fashion since college students used slide rules in math class and went to pay phones at the student union to call their friends. Even then, it was a rarity that certainly never put the nation's security in peril.
>     
> The bill attempts to equate flag-burning with cross-burning, which the Supreme Court, in a sensible and carefully considered 2003 decision, said could be prosecuted under certain circumstances as a violation of civil rights law. It's a ridiculous comparison. Burning a cross is a unique act because of its inextricable connection to the Ku Klux Klan and to anti-black violence and intimidation. A black American who wakes up to see a cross burning on the front lawn has every right to feel personally, and physically, threatened. Flag-burning has no such history. It has, in fact, no history of being directed against any target but the government.
>     
> Mrs. Clinton says her current position grew out of conversations with veterans groups in New York, and there's no question that many veterans -- and, indeed, most Americans -- feel deeply offended by the sight of protesters burning the flag. (These days, that sight mainly comes from videos of the Vietnam War era; the senator's staff did not have any immediate examples of actual New York flag-burnings in the recent past.) But the whole point of the First Amendment is to protect expressions of political opinion that a majority of Americans find disturbing or unacceptable. As a lawyer, the senator presumably already knows that.

Gee, that's weird because I remember the Liberals attacking Clinton for this -- http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/28/washington/28hillary.html

This is a troll account, guys. Do you really think a Rothschild has time/fucks to give to shitpost on twitter? No verified check either, and look through the account's post history. Been seeing it pop up on here recently, it's obvious satire imo
Holy fuck, you/someone is trolling a Rothschild....ballsy ballsy nuts.  But of course she would advocate abolishing the 2nd Amendment, that's the only way they can take over America.  She doesn't know much about red-blooded American patriots, does she boys and girls?
Wait... So the problem was that the terrorist was shot? WTF!!!
Additionally we don't like the sass mouth so get rid of your first amendment as well. That's also the problem. -and uh how do you people feel about quartering soldiers?
I am starting to think some of these leftists aren't human. Seriously.

My only complaint is the presence of snoop. He's a bigtime libtard. I think he's probably involved in the spirit cooking etc. Notice how snoop also has 'multiple personalities / personas' which is a huge red flag for being a part of the illuminati / satanist / MK Ultra hollywood shenanigans.

> Now, you may have been hearing from Jill Stein that the deadline to recount in Pennsylvania is today, November 28, 2016, twenty days after the election. You've been hearing wrong. The November 28, 2016 deadline is not for a recount. It's a deadline to "Contest" the election.  And this is where we call Jill Stein out for conspiring to defraud the electorate as well as defrauding folks donating to her efforts.

> The Pennsylvania Election Code makes a clear distinction between "Recounts" and "Contests". Article XVII (a) is titled "Recounts", whereas, Article XVII (b) is titled, "Classes of Nomination and Election Contests." These are two vastly different beasts.

> The fraud comes with knowledge of the fact that Jill Stein's website has been collecting millions of dollars in funds for a "voter-initiated recount" in Pennsylvania. Triggering a recount was simple under the statute, and had she been timely in her efforts to enlist Pennsylvania voters, she might have been able to truly use the funds raised to make a recount happen in PA. But she's too late, and yet she's still defrauding people by claiming the money will be used for a "voter-initiated recount." That she may try to use the funds to "Contest" the election instead means that the funds were raised via fraudulent representation. There will be no "recount" under Pennsylvania law.


This seems to be a decent tl;dr of the post that Mitchell linked to.

The recount is happening in Wisconsin. Jilf's lawyers just presented a case to require the recount to be done completely by hand without the assistance of tabulation machines.

The Judge ruled that there is no substantial evidence of problems with the voting machines, and it is up to the county clerks to decide if they want to perform the recount in their county by hand or with the assistance of tabulation machines.

Edit: Livestream video has been replaced, I'm sure it will be available on Youtube or the like shortly. Here is the article: http://fox6now.com/2016/11/29/green-party-presidential-candidate-jill-stein-calls-wisconsin-recount-cost-exorbitant/
It would have taken substantial evidence for the judge to over rule the election council, especially since they were unanimous against counting by hand.

Doublethink is a real phenomenon, but the cognitive dissonance is not sustainable.

Widespread mental breakdowns are immanent.
"Russian" hackers tipping the paper ballots of Michigan? Oh that's totally possible! And as evidence, I present the fact that a "Russian" hacker viewed the new voter database in Illinois over the summer! 

But when NPR interviewed the head of California's elections yesterday and asked him how he knows that illegal immigrants don't say "yes" when asked if they would like to register to vote at the time they get their driver's licenses (that are not allowed to ask residency status), and his answer is "IF THEY SAID YES, THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR CRIME."

This clip is fantastic and I seriously suggest you guys watch the whole interview if you can find it. Tucker (at this point this is a given) baits and destroys him the whole time.

Liberal latinos are about to be driven out of their own party by these smug sons of bitches telling them they are wrong and that Castro was okay. 

Sorry Cuban refugees, you are now *problematic*
They need to be called out for their bullshit and have their media/business/academic influences terminated.

This is exactly what is wrong with our academic institutions.
**GET 'EM TUCKER!**

Fuck it get Tucker a 4 hour show, too many cucks, too little time.
"They got bored of their families" you know how absurd this sounds. 
So we here in Germany drown in refugees because everyone is just bored of their families and sick of their wives?

Well would explain why we have hordes of young men raping everything.
TUCKER KILLED YOU
Just when I thought I had heard it all...
Yeah people risked getting brutally executed by a tyrannical dictator because they got bored of their wives.

Fuck this assclown.
Pedo-santa without the suit.
Remember, when the lefties moan about 'free college', what they really want is taxpayer's money to fund indoctrination programs (e.g. from this fucked up professor) to churn out more of their kind.

Academia is a vehicle to spread the disease.
Holy shit, imagine being *this fucking brainwashed.*
Wow Tucker is great
Can we get some centiCubans to go set this guy straight? Preferably by demonstrating EXACTLY WHY they fled?
WTF? I don't even ... WTF?
The cuck looks like Rob Reiner and sounds like a castrato. Castratro for Castro.  
What a fuckin idiot.

Anyone else sick to death of these morons?
Lol @ Tuckers face when that fucking idiot started talking
wait what?

**NO**

It is not enough to rewrite history anymore, just to make up the narrative?  Now they will dig up the sacred memory of Castro's murdered victims and make them a justification for the slaughter?? Erase not just from life, but from memory?  Make the flight of Cubanos a "boredom" instead of a terror? Make their life-threatening dash for freedom a response to lust instead of a response to tyranny? 

Even worse than the slaughter of innocents is the slaughter of memory.  It is their last cry for justice, strangled by the hands of liars...


Liberals: "We lost Florida and never want to win it ever again."
Haven't these people ever seen Scarface? Tony Montana had octopus coming out of his fucking ears man!

It's like Tucker not only knows he's going to stump these libtards every episode, but also that they're going to say at least one thing viral worthy.
LMAO CAN'T CUCK TUCK
At this point I don't think they are "brainwashed"..they are just really evil and depraved people...
Is that the excuse the cuban pool boy gave him when he was caught shagging his wife? Cucks so out of touch with reality he took it as fact.
I know a guy that floated over on a raft to flee that hell hole. His buddy was on another raft and was eaten by a fucking shark. Liberals can go fuck themselves.
Then turn the question around "Is that what the current refugees from syria doing? Why should we let them in if they are just bored or cheating on their wives?" 
Can people stop ripping off the stranger things intro? (They can't) 
What a dumb fuck. 
Lol what a retard, I mean libtard. Same thing.
Seriously wtf 
Shit even on the preview, Carlson's facial expression is telling.

Why is it always these confabulated scenarios instead of Occam's Razor: "I left because things there were shit"?

Oh wait, SJWism is a mental disorder, thats why!
I really like this Tucker guy
Makes me want to watch the Al Capone version of Scarface again.

Yes there were a few Cuban gangsters involved with drugs and other criminal activities; but at the start of the film you can see the boatloads of other people, families and children, that were also fleeing Fidel Castro's version of Cuba.

While the game series called Tropico is a fun spin on the theme, I wouldn't want to live in those conditions.

They appear to reach a conclusion from the air then back track and make up nonsense as support for how they reached it.
Didn't you guys hear the truth about WWII?

Hitler was doing favors for a widespread suicidal Jewish population. It wasn't the horrific massacre that people like to say it was.

Suggest that *some* of the EU influx from Africa and the Middle East aren't refugees but economic migrants, and liberals brand you a cold, heartless xenophobe who'll reach for any excuse to shut foreigners out - even if plenty of the migrants confess as much when interviewed on the ground.
Meanwhile, liberals can get away with insinuating that the bulk of refugees fleeing Communist tyrants are just opportunists escaping a life of bland domesticity - and to hell with what any Cubans say to the contrary.

Double standards like this enrage the living crap out of me. Fuck these people.
isn't this a bit misogikneestic ?

Also...haven't most of the 'refugees' in Europe left their wives behind?
Saw the title, assumed it was a joke in poor taste... but no.

This pasty, rosy-cheeked, pedophille-looking, unhealthy ass lunatic was serious. Billions of years of evolution only to end up with this poor excuse for a man. Sad!


Isn't it just lovely how the dumbest, most degenerate fucks are always the ones who want to assume more and more authority over our lives? Man, modern liberals can go to hell. I've had it with their CONSTANT lies, "ends justify the means" mentality and hatred of all that is good and normal. 


Guys like this guy who are so casually cruel, people like spez who can't deal with free speech if it disagrees with their warped-as-fuck worldviews, the lying MSM and so on. Is there a good or honest lefty ANYWHERE out there? 
Oh yeah. That makes sense. It seems like a great idea to travel 90 miles through shark infested water on a homemade raft to escape your wife and family.

Particularly with the large number of refugees that come here WITH THEIR FAMILIES!




I feel like I'm living in some bizarro universe. I've never heard of Fidel Castro under any light but negative, and the liberal media is praising him? Even in my most cucked state I would have found this disturbing. I thought maybe they were trying to be respectful to the people of cuba, but I've heard they're quite happy about this so the US praising Fidel has got to feel like a slap in the face to them? Are there any articles out there with the Cuban's POV? 

How can they blast Trump for saying anything about Putin when they love this guy though? 

Fuck man. Why must the side that most represents my ideals be so god damn hypocritical. Even motherfucking Jill Stein is either scamming money for her party or secretly in league with Hillary after blasting her all election season. I can't even say she was maybe trying to reveal corruption because you'd need an actual audit for that, not just a recount. 
FL pede here. Cubans definitely did NOT flee just because they got bored of their families!!!! WTF?!??!!
The best thing you can do with these crazies is just let them talk instead of arguing with them and hope that the normal person here's their thoughts and jumps aboard our movement. It's one thing to have differing political views, it's another thing to be flat out insane.

If you're so tired of your spouse that you take the closest inner tube and throw yourself in the ocean hoping to float ashore in a better place then i don't think the escapee is to blame for leaving his/her family.
Holy shit that guy is fucking nuts.

On a side note get rid of wet foot dry foot day 2 of Trump Presidency!
Why would you be bored of Cuba if it was such a utopia?
Where does he find these people holy shit hahahahaha
I would say he got slayed, but that guy slit his own throat on live television.
considering the left were the ones originally ["deporting and breaking up families"](http://www.spaceg.com/multimedia/collection/Elian%20Gonzalez/Elian%20and%20Clinton.jpg), so I can see where they're trying to wash their hands clean of this one.  Their lack of accountability is almost getting sociopathic at this point.
Stay tuned for the next liberal idiocy - ISIS did nuffin wrong, people are fleeing Syria and the Middle East cuz they're bored of their wives. Shit, I gotta stop giving them ideas. These lunatics are dumb enough to say that...
Oh sure, I'll just ask my inlaws if they left Cuba because they got bored.

Fucking moron.
So the same people saying America runs on a system of oppression say Cuba doesn't. Fucking lol
Both of my parents fled Cuba in the early 60s and arrived here with quite literally nothing but the clothes on their back. Knowing their struggle (and to be honest, their rise above it) confirms why I don't hold liberal views. I would love for this entitled piece of trash to become a Cuban citizen and pack his own toilet paper and light bulbs when he needs medical treatment. 
I think he's confusing Cuban refugees with the Syrian "child refugees".
We cannot allow liberals to rewrite history. We need to keep it FACT. Castro was NOT a good person by any means.
Do you want to lose Florida forever cause this is how you lose Florida.
What a deluded inbred dumbass. How do idiots like these get on TV? Even the way this jolly looking fatman even sits, with his nose up, pisses me off. FUCK this guy. 
I loled 
OMFG.
Does Tucker Carlson just invite people on to shit all over them?

That seems to be the theme of his show.
Seriously fuck the left. My family left Cuba in 62. December 20th 1961 armed troops showed up at their front door and told them to hand over the keys to the building they owned because it now belonged to "the people". Empty supermarkets, meat delivered in trash bags by men in the black market, fear of saying anything to anyone, Russian soldiers in the streets with AK-47's a superiority complex and a nasty attitude towards you, seeing gay locals disappear, bread lines, shortages of everything etc etc. All this and this fucking ivory-tower fuck face runs his mouth like this? Fuck him, he should go to Venezuela and hunt dog with the starving locals if he thinks the state-run utopia is so great.
No better place to go than America when you're bored with your wife. We have all the best pussy to grab.
Is this that Tucker guy? I like his "disapproving concern" face
He's right, they just used that whole getting tied to a tree and shot in the face because our family owned a farm thing as an excuse
I guess McCarthy wasn't crazy after all.
Pretty much ensuring cubans will vote republican for generations.
Dan LeBatard, Miami sportswriter/radio host and son of Cuban exiles, put it best when it comes to these liberals and world leaders standing alongside Castro: "We feel alone."
And here in ex-eastern bloc, almost 30 years after we got rid of the inhuman, criminal communist regimes, which wouldn't fall without the help of western democracies, we watch in utter fucking disbelief as leaders and prominent figures of the same countries now suck Castro's dead dick.

Seriously what the fucking fuck in the name of fuck is going on? Bitch come to my door and explain how communism was great for my family and how the communist tyrants were great people and you get both barrels.
This guy teaches young adults.

Frightening.
Speaking as someone who has a BA in history with a focus on Latin America, what the fucking fuckitty fuck is this guy prattling on about? I sometimes wonder if these folks aren't paid actors, because nobody could be that stupid... right? Then again, academia is filled to the brim with people who are intellectuals in title only. 


Refugees celebrating his death tells me what I need to know about Castro. Democrats mourning his death tells me what I need to know about Democrats. 
Seems reasonable.

Hey Rodrigo. Why did you flee your country?

"I was bored lol"
disgusting. 
Pick a story? Are they not sending their best or are they? Are these people escaping a dictator to be free or do we oppress them?
Somebody needs to do the Microsoft paint rendition of that guy ala carl the cuck or aids skrillex. 
Yeah man people do that all the time. Divorce is so messy and complicated. You know what's easier? Gathering up all of your money made over a decade and bartering passage to a foreign country and starting a new life there.
Such callousness. Holy shit.
What a Moron! People was going to risk everything. And, you talk like this? Stupid! 
I've been stunned at the response. I lurked on another sub when it happened and remember a couple positive comments from students who recently studied Castro. I was an idealistic college kid once upon a time, but it's absurd to excuse these kinds of atrocities. Completely absurd. Maybe I should be thankful my history professors weren't trying to promote some sort of agenda. 

I'm not a higher education hater like some, but I'm starting to connect the dots. Of course people have a right to say whatever they want about whoever they want. But whoever these professors are are either failing miserably at their job or pushing some sort of agenda. 

No college or even high school graduate should be celebrating these kinds of tyrants. Completely mystifying. 

Edit : This dude sitting in the northeast preaching to other Americans in Florida how to feel. Anytime someone answers a question about censorship with "Yeah, but", they're opinion is worthless. 


Liberals are very confused people.
That's repulsive. Words don't even do these trash Justice. Repugnant. Liberal. Its connetation should be worse than racist 

How about actually taking a walk down to Little Havana and asking them how they ended up in Miami? 
Whaaaaaa...... I can't even respond to this. Good thing mainstream media isn't big as it used to be otherwise this guy might run into a problem in Miami if he ever goes there....
I graduated from Canisius College and I'm ashamed they hire people like this. I will never give a dime to this school or send my kids there. It is a Catholic institution, but sadly, just like the faith itself, this school is being pulled so far left, it's pathetic. This pro-life, Catholic college even had Hillary Clinton give a speech years ago. I wrote them a letter then saying I will never donate to the school for having her speak, and I have never heard back from them. 
I read the title of the post and thought "There's no way someone could possibly be this stupid. It's just not possible."

&nbsp;

On a completely unrelated note, I have lost all faith in natural selection.
As someone who grew up in South Florida surrounded by Cuban friends, this makes me sick to my very core. I remember listening to stories from my friends' parents on the struggles they faced, one story Ill never forget was when the entire family had to eat rags (well marinated by the way) in order to survive a few days due to the lack of food available. This election has revealed to me just how delusional and dangerous the globalist left truly are. I am ashamed to have ever been a registered democrat.
Tucker's face when be said that! "Libscum making my job too easy."
put this guy in a boxing ring please.
In one sentence this guy defended a brutal dictator while also labelling Cuban men as scumbags.


Impressive. I mean - he's a certifiable shill - but impressive none the less.
I live in Key West, we get man made rafts come up on the beaches frequently. They are made out of ANYTHING. tires, tarp, wood, I couldn't be paid to even float 3 miles on these things in the open water, so to say people do this out of boredom is so selfish and stupid. 
He looks baked af 
Most ridiculous claim I've heard thus far. 
What a buffoon. I live in Florida and have worked with MANY Cubans over the years. Every one of them fled the country due to oppression from the regime. The stories about their journeys to get to the States are the stuff of nightmares. One guy told me how he was on a raft for two weeks. He ended up in the Bahamas and then was able to find a boat captain that brought him to the states.
/r/tucker_carlson
Someday, when I get bored of my wife, I'm going to fashion a raft out of sticks and garbage, and float across a body of water, hope to not die, and land in a country where I know nobody, don't speak the language, have no means to support myself, and live there because fuck, divorce proceedings are rough. 
I feel bad for his wife. Projection is a bitch but apparently so is she.
Yeah building a raft and risking your life to cross a sea to reach another country sounds much easier than getting divorced when you get bored of your wife....
All Tucker does is BTFO cucks all day long. I love it.
that's sexist.
LIBERAL PROJECTION HAS REACHED NEW HEIGHTS


I saw this guy last night. He infuriated me. Every time I watch TC I fall a little more in love though. 
Another liberal schmuck. Where do these people come from? Why cant they leave to another liberal/socialist country. Sheesh.
This guy was generally just really dumb :/ 

That student last week did a better job then this guy. I'm baffled honestly. 
This guy is a fuck boy on the right. What a load of bullshit. 
He certainly picked a deranged professor. Look at him smiling the whole time. High as a kite.
So what if Carlson kept interrupting him. De La Pedraja is on his own planet anyway.
I think this libtard is bored of his wife.
I think he's mistaking [CURRENT YEAR] "refugees" for Cubans fleeing a dictator
Try to cuck the Tuck. 

I fucking dare you.
Those kind of mental gymnastics will turn a man crazy. Big pharma gonna make a lot of $ off the libs in the near future. Sad!
Dammit I'm so upset that Santa Claus is cucked... I shoulda known all this time. Cookie eating bastard. 
Lol omfg!  Liberals are so retarded!
what the actual fuck is up with santa claus?
there's no cucking that tuck
Body language: Pulling of the ear indicates insincerity. He knows he's full of shit.
I'm sure that is true for X number of people. I would bet some Westerners who defected to Russia were just 'escaping personal lives' and I bet some Americans who fled to Cuba did so to escape wives or taxes. 

but nobody is better at using 'exceptions to the rules' like liberal narrative manipulators. Rather than seeing exceptions as 'proving the rule' they see them as 'canceling the rule out'. 

But Castro was something like Saddam Hussein. He wasn't really hiding anything. He was proud of it and even liked people knowing about it. Its not like we have some big swirling rumors or mystery when Castro so much as filmed these things, spoke about them in long long detailed rants, made little effort to let his justice system be well known. etc. 


Came here to post this video.  Finds video already triggering.  

OP, you never disappoint.
Does anyone know what the music at the end of 1791L's videos is? I'd like to hear more of it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKjxFJfcrcA&t=0m4s
The guy looks like a caricature commie. He probably has posters of Castro in his bedroom. 
He went full retard. He actually did it. 
Seriously though, the left is attempting to go full on socialism and even communism. They aren't even hiding it anymore. 
What a fucking scumbag. Who is this guy? I want to look up his views and I'm having a hard time finding the answer. Help me out here, fam!
#PROFESSOR CUCKSTRO
Why are all the msm sources portraying Fidel in a positive light?

I'd it because they secretly want to shut down places like our sub?
These people are truly insane
I hope President Trump's healthcare plan places mental health at the forefront so people can be seen and diagnosed properly with "liberalism".  This degenerative brain disease has started to get out of hand.  Epidemic?
Tucker needs to bring in a competent debater one of these days. Though making fools out of these idiots never gets old
I wouldn't be surprised if I read something on some shitty MSM channel like

>'poor old man beat up by angry racist A-Zphobic cubans'


I think he is more of a idiot than a actual liberal
Fuckwits cheeks r rosey red like he's had too much to drink
That douche it's from a Catholic college.  Think he would know better
Tucker looks absolutely baffled that that guy is saying that. 
He assumes the Cubans are as big of a cuck as he is. Projection 
Jews during world War 2: "we fled Hitler because we wanted to abandon our families and fuck younger men and women in America, and not because he was killing us all."

Anyways that liberal retard talks like he has been to Cuba and everyone there has been begging to here about all the young pussy walking around the United States.
I wish we could trade all these white liberal traitors for Cubans who want to be free. We're bored of them.
So according to you guys, millions of Syrians left not because of government oppression or tyranny but because they were tired of living there and wanted to come to Europe.

But obviously Cubans would never leave Cuba because they were tired of living in Cuba and wanted to come to America.


Literally just spit my coffee on the train 
I love the Tuck. He's an absolute savage.
I get bored of my family sometimes, but I don't board a boat that used to be a truck and sail across the ocean to get away from it.  
Those are probably the reasons why his family left him.. But not the right time for this snowflake to sponge clean a dictator of his crimes with the most retarded excuse anyone ever heard 
Trump is literally Hitler but Castro and his buddy Che were great leaders....and they wonder why nobody trusts them anymore 
That professor has the most punchable face 
Tucker Carlson is quickly becoming my favorite person
Americans get bored and tired of their wives sometimes.

They don't fucking flee the damn country.  How could anyone be so retarded?
Im super confused.  Wasn't it a democratic president who put the embargo in place against Cuba? JFK? Where is this coming from, I don't know anyone who thinks Castro is a good thing?
Now THAT is racist
Tell that to Andy Garcia, who left when he was 5.  Tell that to Gloria Estefan, whose Dad fled and later took part in the Bay of Pigs botched invasion.  
Lol what a joke
Long title not necessary, next time just write "TUCKER" and that will be fine
I ‚ù§Ô∏è tucker!
Go on Google and type in Anna De Rothschild and look at her Twitter page, read her Twitter feed the globalist are trying to get Hillary Clinton in and stopping Trump from becoming President. The Rothschild's are funding the recount.
This is a warning people, Go on Google and type in Anna De Rothschild and look at her Twitter page, read her Twitter feed the globalist are trying to get Hillary Clinton in and stopping Trump from becoming President. The Rothschild's and Soros are funding the recount to stop Trump from becoming President by January.

Most likely a plant. It's fuxs news bra bra.
That is why I like to type

**President**-Elect **Donald J. Trump**
**CONFIRMED** 
I just did a scientific study on this about 3 mins ago and have confirmed this does work.
#DONALD TRUMP
My favorite is calling him President Trump. Triggers the YouTube commenters pretty well too.
Meh, after looking at the comment in question I'm not sure you got poked because of the capitalization of DJT. You capitalized a lot of words in that comment. Don't cry victim and then run over here to whine. It makes our community look WEAK.
It's all that high energy you've got going on, it blinds them. 

It's like chasing vampires with an LED flashlight.
LMFAO i saw that earlier and died laughing at how many people you triggered. Good work OP keep em shaking, literally.
Is there a **president** for this kind of behaviour???
It was me who you apparently triggered. In reality you just type like a moron and I only cared to check your post history to see if you actually did always type like that. 
hey look a hollywood guy that doesn't want to tell half of his customer base to fuck off.  

glad i can still watch marky mark movies without feeling dirty
Quote from the article:

> A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù he told Task & Purpose last week, at a swanky luncheon in New York, held on behalf of his upcoming film ‚ÄúPatriots Day.‚Äù We were talking about the parade of actors and musicians who lined up to denounce Donald Trump in the months and weeks leading up to Election Day


And:

> You know, it just goes to show you that people aren‚Äôt listening to that anyway,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThey might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don‚Äôt put food on their table. You don‚Äôt pay their bills. A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble. They‚Äôre pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I‚Äôm very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it‚Äôs afforded me, I also understand what it‚Äôs like not to have all that.
Looks like I'm buying his movie catalogue

So, no boycotting of Marky Mark, glad someone is still sane.

Yeah but.. he's still a satanic demon...
Don't think we need another unapologetic racist felon around.

Baldwin's vacuous stares are an embarrassment to even the dumbest Liberals.

The only way to see a bigger Hack - is to watch reruns of the Friday the 13th movies.
At least she stood up to the guy who said the "N" word on her show.  But then she thanked him and told him how much respect she has for him.  
Ya but she is kinda hot
If this hack was on my TV, I wish I was watching an adult video. 
It's so sad to see a sexy women who sides with the DNC. 
I got a feeling Trump is trolling him big time.. 
"Mitt, I know this might be hard for you but for the good of the country I need you to hang around Trump Tower for a  while... you help me vet all these appointments. You don't have a snowball's chance in hell of getting anywhere yourself this time around, you and I both know that, but it's important for several reasons. You know I wasn't half-steppin' when I said you would have to bend the knee. I can't go back on that; bad optics for me to go back on that promise, sure, I know you understand. 

Plus, I need people to think that I am giving you a fair chance - again, with the optics. So, if you are really serious about saving your career in public service - and I know you are basically a decent person - I need you to just be a good soldier for a while - a long while. You have to rehabilitate this yourself, Mitt. You're not some former Wal*MArt manager who wants to raise himself by doing a good job on my TV show - you're somebody with a great resume. We want to keep that talent working for the country, but you are going to have to prove yourself.

Wouldn't you and Ann like to come to Mar-A - Lago for Thanksgiving - say, in 2020? Be a good boy, stay in Sunday School or whatever it is you people do in your magic underwear - I donno, I'm Presbyterian, myself - and it's possible. What I'm saying, Mitt, is this - do you see yourself as a long term investor?"
His knee may be hurting him...maybe if he bends it a bit it'll feel better.
Looks like he jsut got the carpet cleaning bill.
Trump just banged Ann while Mitt watched in a corner.
People never seem to smile when they are eating crow.
"Mitt, I've been considering your qualifications and after such an impressive result in your last presidential run I'm thinking a promotion is in order."

"We need a groundskeeper for the fall. Will bring you on as a temp and should you meet our standards of making the lawn great again we will speak about the next steps available to you."

"Oh, and careful with that drink, would hate to see you choke, once was enough."

I like Antonin Scalia's point of view on Flag burning. 

>‚ÄúIf it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag,‚Äù Scalia said.

However, he believed and upheld the notion that it is a protected form of speech under the 1st.

>Back in 1989, Scalia was the fifth and deciding vote in the Texas v. Johnson decision that upheld flag burning in Texas, and a year later, he voted against a federal law that banned flag burning in United States v. Eichman.

I think Trump would be best served adopting a similar point of view. I fully believe Trump _would_ lock people up for the act if it were up to him personally, but he also needs to let folks know it's not up to him, and it's protected speech in our constitution.
Trump tweets for breakfast and sets the agenda for the nightly news.
Isn't it arson when people do it in public places? So against the law anyways.
Meanwhile, /r/Politics is literally exploding.
The  Jimmies  have been  rustled...on all  sides.

 He meant to  spark a debate on an old  subject  we  all thought  was  dead....it worked.
i dunno about that, even though i do not condone flag burning.  i like living in a country that allows you to burn it
Yes burning the American Flag is a hate speech and a hate crime and promotes terror. As it was with the Ohio Muslim Islamic Terrorist, you know like bacon.  
Yes please, I think all national flags should be respected.

Fuck faction flags like the Nazi, isis, and EU flags though
Did it really happen?

Milo is great, but he's not an American and Trump's press secretary should be. I'm sure that somewhere in America there is someone just as good as Milo and I'm sure Trump will find that person.
I love Milo, but of all the things that won't ever happen, that's one of them. 
üôåüèº I love this man, he speaks the truth and gives zero fucks what anyone thinks. And he's absolutely beautiful to look atüòç

>One young woman was allowed to postpone her jail time because she needed to take final college exams.

Excuse me 
Five days. Get real.

I could stand on my head for five days. Should have been 90-180 days.
Great news!
Good to hear!   
Devil's advocate here.....

Let's face it, Trump is not a politician.  This is good.  But it's also scary for some people.  Trump speaks his mind.  This is good.  But it's also scary for some people.

Over the next four years, we will need to be accepting of those who doubted him.  We will need to welcome them across the abyss and into a more competent and logical world.  As we do this, we will need to forgive them for doubting, and yes, even for their protests.  

I trust Trump.  If he feels that there is a place for Romney, I'm okay with it.  It may be an excellent lesson for us all.  Unity comes through change and it's not always pretty.  But you have to have the courage to move through it.  If Trump takes the first step, I'll be right behind him.
But he had the balls to stand up and do it. That's clearly more important to Big Don. See Haley for confirmation.
I really hope it isn't Mitt, but I'd understand if it is.
Secretary of Unclogging Toilets
It's very clear to me that it's going to be him, I hope I'm wrong but he's the only one that gave an interview for the job multiple interviews and a fancy diner..I hope I'm wrong
But  my gut says it's him 
Here here 
I like Romney for the gig. Trump refuses to fit in the media's box. Remember his temperament? Not any more! 

Romney is solid at running things(unlike HRC). He does good, Trump looks good. 

He has to suffer the embarrassment of Trump being President while he is not. Good enough for me. 
What would he gain from stabbing him in the back?  He would be fired immediately, leaving a legacy of shame.  He's too old and failed too many times to ever hold any clout politically for the rest of his life if he was purged.  His only move is to take the job, perform well and retire with a much improved legacy.  
Romney should be SoS
Or how she started +400 because of super delegates lol
This makes my blood boil. That and the fuckery that is going to happen in Michigan.
It started in Iowa. With only like 70% reporting and a very close contest, the Clinton campaign proclaimed Hillary the winner. She then took the stage and screamed a Thank You to Iowa for her victory. The next day before 100% of the votes were counted and there was any chance at realistic audit, the Iowa DNC certified Hillary the winner. This was after multiple reports of caucus districts where Bernie supporters were being suppressed and votes being recounted to favor Hillary. This type of fuckery was repeated in states all over the country where the state DNC committees were run by Hillary supporters. Anyone that doesn't know that the DNC completely rigged the primary and stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders all with the cooperation of the propaganda media, has surely been watching too much fake news. 
Why does the democratic party even have voting booths?


Hypocrisy, that is also known as liberalism.
It's shit like this that make it no wonder Trump won.  

You take a candidate who had to rig the system to win her primary and put her against someone who won his in spite of a rigged system. 
Such a positive mentality and Amazing action. Really needed one! Well Done
The queen of rigging the popular vote.
Karma is a bitch. 
Sounds like you're a sexist! /s
Is that Common Core math? WTF
But wasn't Bernie a plant? If that's the case, then the primary was rigged from the very beginning. 
I'm honestly happy Bernie got fucked by the DNC and sold out. Everytime I visit /r/liberalcirclejerk and read a quote of his I can tell he's just starting to say things that don't make sense. It's not angering me as much as it is gaining myself pity for the oldmanchild. I honestly think Bernie is a nutcase. Fuck Bernie Sanders

>When Trump talks his disgraceful and unfounded nonsense about millions of people voting illegally, he is sending a very clear signal that the Republicans will move to make it harder for people of color, the elderly, immigrants, young people and poor people to participate in elections.

Yeah, that or he's trying to make sure you democrats stop using illegals to rig elections. ID politics are the lowest form of low IMO. Bernie is a cuck who I honestly can't believe made it into politics. I feel like politicians pat him on the head like a child with a participation trophy and tell him "great job" and throw a lolly pop his way. And then Bernies ego builds and he actually starts to think his ideas make sense.

Or better can we fund a full-time investigator to seek the truth behind Seths death? If we all threw in a buck couldn't that go a long way to help in this open case murder?
Are we at a 100% it was Podesta or are we still lying to ourselves?

I would LOVE to see one of their Left-wing feminists wear a hijab.

Leftiest can't get their story straight.  They want women's right in all forms, but then whole heartily support a religion where women have no rights???  
Chris Coumo thinks they should learn self-defense

If your news source told you that you should wear a hijab even if you aren't a muslim, you were probably watching fake news
Seriously? After a Muslim extremist just tried to kill a shit ton of people after following ISIS's orders??? How does CNN even still exist 
How about we start burning hijabs instead of flags. Fuck CNN. 
When is America going to be America again? (rhetorical).  If you had a father who said, "My house, my rules" you know what I mean. 
You first, princess.
Actually we all should wear MAGA hats to unify the county as one, right CNN? 
They don't need to pay top dollar for attractive anchors anymore if they make their staff go that route! 
Great idea....once they install a Hijab they also give up their right to work, vote, drive, and think.
Ah, how about they don't wear hijabs in solidarity with us, it's our country after all and they're the ones wanting to be admitted.
I really hope this catches on. Something about the idiots branding themselves is strangely appealing to me.
Maybe they'll come and take all our guns too. Hahahahaha

"But you don't need guns because the government will protect you" - my fellow Europeans
Well DUH. This is why we have gun free zones. REEEEEEEE
This except replace the criminal with terrorist idealistic SJW
I wish I had bought stock in gun companies 8 years ago. Sales have been through the roof the whole time Obama has been in.
Guys, gun control is super simple, I really don't know how no one figured it out.  Just round up all **300 million guns** and get rid of them!  We can probably do it in a weekend if we all pitch in, who's with me?  
It's a little too subtle for SJWs.
If you don't need a gun because we have police, then you don't need a fire extinguisher, because we have firefighters.
If you are not a criminal why would have any trouble passing a background check? Most people just want a background check system that will prevent criminals and terrorists from obtaining guns, but no one can compromise on that because somehow that means law abiding citizens won't get their guns. 
Look at drugs. They're illegal yet people still seem to get them.
you dont need guns, if a criminal has you at gun point just call the police

I saw a movie about a place where only the police and military had guns, it was called 'Schindler's List'

Deleting the truth to enforce the narrative - Liberalism 2016.
I remember someone once said that conservatives should take more extreme versions of liberal arguments, which would force liberals to expose their flaws. For example; argue for a 50 dollar an hour wage and they'll respond that would kill jobs. Seems like trump has taken up that idea.
They take the bait every single time.  
Having heard Scalia's interview about flag burning before and how he hates it but it is allowable under the constitution I was concerned for about 2 seconds and then I said out loud, "oh this is a troll post, Hillary probably supported it." Then boom, found out she cosponsored the bill. This is going to be a fun time in our lives!  
WOW!
Trump has the truth on his side and knows how to leverage it.
Was just commenting to my dad about this. Trump is showing the left why Scalia was such a good justice. Someone they've had nothing but hatred for for decades.
What is he doing?
His NBA franchise the Mavericks are in last place in the entire league right now!  Karma...?  
He admits he's dumber than dumb in his responses.  He thinks they could've found a way to win and still doesn't realize we weren't gonna lose. Mark Cuckanbot
And to think that I USED to like mark......
Still don't trust him. I want to hear why he was meeting with Bannon.

I posted a comment that he should watch Clinton Cash to help him understand why Trump won.
Damnit, Bannon, you're gonna make them evolve if you spill the beans.
Fuck you Cuban go stand on a stage with Corrupt Hillary and campaign.
What a non-apology. Sorry Cuban, but the Trump train has left the station and you weren't on it. Good news is that I heard there's an opening in a dictator position on a certain Caribbean island.

I once frequented a local coffee shop whose owner has a Dallas Mavericks license plate frame on his car...(I have since stopped patronizing his shop, as he thinks ObamaCare is "the greatest thing since sliced bread")...

I took my money elsewhere to a different shop, and this local coffee+bicycle shop's owner happened to change his political affiliation from DEM to GREEN (and subsequently voted for Dr. Jill Stein)...[He even (facetiously) blurted out, "Make America Great Again!" on Election Day, even though he did not vote for Trump.]...

More recently, Jill came out to be a pawn for George Soros, Hillary Clinton, etc....

[I still like this coffee+bicycle shop, though...the owner is cool...unlike the other shop and owner...]

Not dumb about President Trump just dumb
He "kind of" apologized...  does that mean he could be Secretary of State ?   (Better than Mitt wit)
Credit where credit is due.  He is publicly admitting he was wrong, and kind of admires the crazy son of a bitch for playing everyone.  Unlike 99% of everyone else.
I couldn't find a reputable (non blog) source or video of him saying this. 

Sorry 'pedes. If anyone has a source (preferably video) PM me. I like being proven wrong. 
It's scary when this is seen as a "fringe" "alt-right" view.
Putin actually has a lot of complex thoughts on the subject, since this is a pretty complex issue, especially for Russia, which is hugely multiethnic and multiconfessional. He almost certainly didn't say the words in the OP, but here's this excerpt from [an article he wrote](http://www.ng.ru/politics/2012-01-23/1_national.html) (translation mine):

"For Russia, with her wide variety of languages, traditions, ethnic groups, and cultures, the 'national question,' with no exaggeration, is one of fundamental importance. Any responsible politician or statesman must admit to himself that one of the most important underpinnings of the very existence of our country is civil and interethnic harmony..."

(He goes on to say of Western countries...)

"The 'melting pot' of assimilation churns and smokes - and is incapable of 'digesting' the ever-growing tremendous migratory current. 'Multiculturalism' - which rejects integration through assimilation - has become a reflection of this in politics. It elevates the 'right of the minority to remain distinct' into an absolute, while simultaneously failing to adequately balance this right with civil, behavioral, and cultural obligations as regards the indigenous population and society as a whole.

"In many countries, closed-off ethno-religious communities are formed, which refuse not only to assimilate, but even to adapt. We know of quarters and whole cities where entire generations of immigrants live on social welfare and do not speak the language of the country in which they reside. The reaction in response to this model of behavior is a growth in xenophobia on the part of the indigenous population, an attempt to violently defend its own interests, jobs, and social services from 'foreign competitors.' People are shocked by the aggressive pressure leveled against their traditions and accustomed lifestyle, and seriously fear the threat of losing the identity of their nation-state."

So, not quite the OP, but pretty based.

Edit: Putin's party, United Russia, is called that in part because it trumpets the aforementioned multiethnic and multiconfessional nature of the country. It has made serious enemies of the extremist right, and harshly rejects any anti-minority violence as "hooliganism" (criminal offense). So, if you read an article describing Putin or his government as "nationalistic," you're probably reading some very fake (and lazy) news. 
Obama is irrelevant now. 
Putin is an interesting person... He's by no means your friendly, yo-ho president. He can be extremely cruel at times and overall, he's not really a good person... BUT.... Few people could do a better job at leading Russia. He has his priorities straight when it comes to his country and I admire that. The US could learn a lot from Putin politic wise.
This quote is falsely attributed to him I'm pretty sure 
Even if he didn't say this, he definitely runs Russia with this kind of mentality 
Actually Putin never said this. 
Why do US government officials hate putin so much? I mean I know he was a KGB spy and there is no telling how many war crimes he's guilty of from the ares of his life, but what from I have read he is an outstanding leader. I've read he flipped the Russian economy and brought it back up and it is now booming again, also has an eighty something percent approval rating. Why do they hate him so much? 
What a racist, sexist, homophbic, islamaphobic, xenophobic, irredeemable deplorable.
I mean it be cool if he said it, and he probably stand for that. But this is fake 
Vlad speaking truth !
Reminds me of the Teddy Roosevelt quote
I saw this on ifunny earlier. Surprised it actually got featured. 
One of his balls is bigger than all dem balls together. 
But CNN said he was hateful.....
Idk if it was also fake news, but supposedly a Russian threw a couple Molotov cocktails in a refugee building https://sputniknews.com/europe/201611271047901334-austria-refugees-camp/ . No one was harmed and very little damage, but stark contrast to the burning of their own refugee camp by setting fire to mattresses due to problems amongst themselves. This source says nutella and gummi bears but many other articles claim other reasons like no food, racial tensions, and promiscuity. Who knows the truth xD http://usa.onlinenigeria.com/news/163539-migrants-burned-down-dusseldorf-refugee-centre-causing-e10m-in-damage.html . I wonder if the crime rate among immigrants is as high in Russia as other societies that have been more cucked. Taking an uneducated guess, I'm betting they're more respectful. 

This is just common sense... It's sad we have to teach common sense. 
Trump feels the same way.

Real men & women feel the same way.

It's crazy common sense is under attack right now. But they're losing. So enjoy the ride
"if **it** wants to live in Russia"

Holy shit. Trump came into my room to bring me a plate of spicy wins and I literally screamed at him and hit the plate of wins out of his giant hands. He started making America great again and I slammed the door on him. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to not my president but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he still winning? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want a cuck to be president and fix my safe space. I cannot fucking deal with this much winning right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was polling well in Texas???? This is so fucked.

it's called Thighing. Basically humping on the baby's thigh until cumming. Common tradition in old school Islam
  The reason nature made all young the way it did, is to insure the survival of the species and that humans won't hurt them.
  The fact that a belief system had to come up with rules for this kind of practice,  tells me they're void of a lot more then basic instincts.
It'd be a shame if this made it to /r/all
This is what the liberals are defending.  Mental...Illness.
Disturbing and disgusting ideology. 
Nothing surprises me when it comes to Islam anymore. 
I think I'm gonna puke.  This is so disturbing.
Ya...and this is what we are supposed to be tolerant of...fuck that noise. 
To be fair, is this what the guy actually said? Or is this BS that the MSM made up to inflame anti-Iranian sentiment? After seeing how much the MSM lies about almost everything Trump says, it makes me wonder about what else they've lied about but we didn't realize, so we accept it as truth.

A lot of bernie supporters flipped after wikileaks revealed hillary rigged the primaries against bernie. Regardless of our political ideologies, this online movement for trump is a movement against political correctness, against race baiting, and for common sense. That is the common thread between every single centipede here even if we are liberal or conservative or nationalist or hippy.
That's because we are all about making America great again for everyone. That's what the left lost in their identity politics strategy - the fact that our common interests, amongst all groups, are much greater than any differences we may have with each other. Finally it is about US instead of US vs. THEM. 
Coats are for everybody.  They come in all sizes.  All you gotta do to get one is recognize that they're made out of the finest materials.
Wow, posted 1 minute ago and already downvoted to 75%?
Unfortunately, there are far too many people who have bought the MSM propaganda that Trump supporters are vile people.

In reality, the atmosphere here is far more accommodating to all points of views, and content of character is the only thing that matters to most posters.  There is plenty of room in the Trump tent, all new-comers are welcomed without judgement.  MAGA
We're  not radical  - that's what liberals really are. 

I knew  what u meant though.  =)
I know this is a stupid anecdotal story but I feel like it's somewhat relevant. I'm a white dude from a place where blacks were clearly the minority in K12, like probably 5-10%. In third grade my best friend was the most badass dude ever named Odai. I never once thought about his skin color until I was forced to reach back to those memories to "prove I'm not racist" by some SJW douche bag. 
We got pissed at Bernie supporters because they were violent to us in real life

It turn out, it was Hillary paid agitators pretending to be Bernie supporters
From my earliest posts (check it out), I was worried, scared, afraid...this DOMREDDIT lifted me up and accepted me quickly. What a community! What a MOVEMENT! I HAVE NEVER felt more ACCEPTED and involved in a online community before. **HERE BE TIGERS! HERE BE WINNERS!**
Am also black.  Don't tell the narrative.
It goes beyond them seeing the light too. That's what so many on the left don't understand - we don't have to be enemies even if we disagree. The problem is that if they disagree with our views they disagree with our views. It sucks but meh. On the other hand if we disagree with their views we're fucking inhuman monsters that are fair game for **anything** bad and we fucking *deserve* it, and more. This hate is actually what drove me away from the left before the election even started. 
I'm a minority female. The racism lie is one of the many reasons why libs have underestimated us and the Emperor. We're not a bunch of racists--this election has nothing to do with race! We just don't want to see the country go down the crapper. Everyone of every background and persuasion is welcome and we are all unified in this goal.

yea, cause were normal and not clinically insane 
Red Skinned Injian Bernout here. I flipped just before the second debate, but still shyed away from here until a few weeks before the election. Didn't necessarily believe what they were saying, but didn't exactly imagine this place to be what it was. Even I was surprised by how warm and welcoming this place is. It's my idea of egalitarian. Everyones equal no matter what. Celebrate the diverse amongst you to show everyones welcome, but hold them to the same standards as everyone else and treat them as equal as everyone else.

THATs how social justice should be. Not some fucking false flagging virtue signaling pieces of shit who belittle the actual victims by making it unclear if their issues are legitimate or not.
More buried hatchets, and more coats! But it must be done legally! 
Respect, thanks for speaking up.  Lots of hate going on outside this sub that would make one think like we're all the devil.  
Most of us are pretty moderate. Like Trump, like your average voter.
You will likely never feel more accepted than this subreddit.  If someone follows all law and supports Trump, you are welcome!  We just want some order back in this nation.
MAGA
Nope, no ego here.  There's no need to for us to say that we were "right" (whatever that means) or for them to ask for our blessing.  We just want more prosperity for all and for us to get back to being one country again.  That's our eye on the prize.
OF COURSE YOU'RE A FUCKING WHITE MALE!!!
My American family - I want to look you in the eyes and tell you I love you. I want the best for you and yours. Let's hope and work for a better tomorrow together. Many blessings. 
Cultural Marxism is all about separating and dividing us as Americans. That is why it must be purged. It's like a bad employee that destroys the morale of the rest of your good employees. 

You are a Trump supporter who loves America and wants it to be greater (wealthier, stronger, safer) than we ever dreamed who happens to also be black. You are a part of our big American family and we fight shoulder to shoulder together for policies that are best for us and our children and not globalist elites.
You can't blame anyone for being ignorant, about 15 months ago I thought Trump was a fucking joke because of the media targeted towards my generation. Once I started to actually do some fucking research on my own I realized the truth. I don't care if you can't speak english, I don't care if you're black, white, chinese, gay, transvestite, confused, mentally retarded, atheist, jewish, man, women, child, smart, dumb. If you support America, and support what's right for America, and welcome Trump then you're welcome here in my book, no matter your past ideologies. 
There's always room on the Trump Train.  Plus something about brakes.  Wanna help a brutha out, Bot?
We don't follow identity politics and we don't race bait. That's one thing we hate.
Get this black patriot a coat! 
I'm in my late forties and part of what I have noticed is the media can pick any wack job and make that person represent the average Republican,Trump supporter,environmentalist or whoever depending on the issues..

You develop a pretty thick skin going against PC. Identity politics has no solutions,just slogans. I have asked numerous black acquaintances over the years what exactly was Obamas economic plan for their communities? It's not a slam of Obama,just a question. We don't discuss issues anymore.
Liberals on Facebook: "Everyone who voted for Trump is sexist and racist."

Me: "You know gay black women voted for Trump right."

Liberals on Facebook: "Yeah, well they are dumb and don't know whats good for them."

Me: "Thats sexist and racist." 
I am awesome. And darn it, people like me!

OP but you're a fucking black white male!
The truth is most people are good people. I've had the good fortune to travel much of the world and have found people to be wonderful all over Europe Egypt turkey. The "rude "Parisians-lovely people.

I traveled all over Central America South America and of course the United States, most people are wonderful.

It's our movements and our governments and in the case of religions then aspire to be governments those groups that are the troublemakers.

I think it's the thing that leftists cannot understand at all-if you leave people alone and let them choose freedom of association and take the teeth out of government so that it's harder to use government to force your beliefs on others, then actually we are closer and closer to a happy hippie world.


I'm a leftist, not a big fan of Trump and not even American and I still feel more welcome here than on most of reddit. I even unsubscribed from politics because of the creepy fascist vibes I get from the comments. It's very disturbing really, for me, who fought against fascism all his life, to go to a "left-wing" subreddits like politics and find vile and insidious fascism crawling from people pretending to be on the left.

I don't understand why other redditors say this is an echo chamber, I've been able to say whatever the fuck I wanted without getting banned or downvoted. I think some people come here with battleground mentality and then start whining when they get rekt because they didn't really think things through. If you come here for fun and dialogue, I discovered that people are more than willing to listen and have some fun.

Trump isn't even that strange or extreme to me, he's way more progressive than 99% of politicians in my country (doesn't say much, I know). He waved an LGBT flag in the middle of the RNC. You know what happens to Romanians who would go to right wing meetings and wave LGBT flags? They would get beaten and hospitalized, probably killed. I really don't understand the fuss.
Right on, Patriot! It's a great feeling be part of America !!!
So many coats, so much love.  Love Trumps Hat!

Anyone is welcome to jump on this high speed train.  As long as you aren't trying to slow us down, you are helping to #maga and we love you for it.  

We will be far more loyal than the false promises of the liberal wagon that limps a long and limits free thinking.  
#FUCK YEAH ... Somebody else other than me uses Radical. We were BORN TO MAGA
I don't think I have ever heard a black person say radical. I like you.
Glad you're part of the fam, Patriot!
It's almost like we like/dislike people based on things other than race...

But that can't be. If I dislike a black person it surely can't be because I just dislike them for other reasons and they happen to be black. Surely it's because I'm a racist monster. 


#I LOVE YOU GUYS!

#BEST SPOT ON THE WEB RIGHT HERE!

#WE ARE GOING TO MAGA!
We just love America. Race and all that bullshit is the left's territory. 
We are the glue of this republic and we want to MAGA
#I just see a great American.. black white tan.. who cares?  Just want to MAGA
Normally, I get pretty mean and disparaging comments on Reddit when I stand up for transgender people or mention being transgender.

However, right after the election, I made a comment on this board about being a conservative person that just so happens to be transgender, and I have never gotten more love on Reddit before! I hope it inspires other people to feel encouraged. 
Careful friend.  "Progressives" don't like when black men don't have the correct views.
**we love you too brochacho!**
The best part about fighting with the nu left is that words are violence, so all it takes is a fuck you to beat them
We here do not believe people are "unredeemable" as the Hillary camp thinks.
+1 for using 'radical' I've been trying to get that back into everyday speech for years. 
We love you TrumpInDaTrap! We are all the same here and I'm so glad you feel warmly welcomed, because you really, truly are. MAGA, Centipede!!! <3 
Has this woke individual been given a coat?
#TRUTH IS RADICAL
####COMMON SENSE####
In the end we're all Americans; we'll welcome you no matter your race, political or religious beliefs, as long as you want the best for our country and have an open mind.
Once Bernie was knocked out I jumped onto the Trump train. In hindsight, I think Bernie would be too weak to take on the establishment. So all in all everything worked out about as great as it could have. 
Yeah everyone has been cool with me even though I'm an BernOut. Never did get a coat but GA is pretty temperate so I'm probably fine without one. 
I had an employee who actually thought Bernie was running as an independent.  She was going crazy on her phone to prove me wrong that he was a dem.  Her cred is gone.  Her whining has stopped.  
You said it.. You see we were never the hate filled racist sexist nut jubs they were telling everyone we were. The America first idea was that America trancended everything, race, sexual orientation, economic status etc.. Its about uniting to " MakeAmericaGreatAgain" and by again it means better than ever before. Thanks for making this post sir! MAGA!!!
I don't give one shit about the color of your skin. I could care less. I care about if you want a better life for you and your family and understand what is really happening in the world; if you respect our constitution and the ideals and rights it holds; and putting American people first. 
I've never felt more included in a sub-reddit than I do in this one. 
You too my friend! Centipede fro CA giving you a big MAGA thumbs up!
Or if you dont even know the attacker was a muslim refugee. My wife listens to NPR in the car and she had no idea until I told her this morning. 
Have a great day!
funny how us Republicans can handle ourselves in a dignified classy manner isn't it?  Instead of rioting and trying to destroy and cry our way into what we want.
Bernie supporter here who donated 1k to Bernie's campaign.

I'm currently banned from /r/sandersforpresident and was banned /r/hillaryclinton (I'm a life long democrat, who has never voted repub prior to this election.)

You know who didn't ban me? /r/the_donald... in fact they answered all of my questions extremely earnestly and were the most amicable group out of the three. This is why I voted a full republican ticket this year. This sub directly influenced my vote, and specifically the kindness and warmness of the people is what put me over the edge and got me to support god-emperor.

I am now a full-fledged centipede, and I will gladly with open arms always welcome new 'pedes regardless of race, religion or sexual alignment. 

I am glad to say that not only did I vote a full repub ticket, I managed to redpill a bunch of people and got them to hop aboard the Trump train as well!
We take all kinds here in America, so long as you are a 

###BASED PATRIOT 

Who loves their country and it's people. So long as you love the flag and what it stands for, we welcome you with open arms. Unlike leftists who kick people to the curb based on religion, skin color, or political affiliations. 
We love our fellow Trump supporters. Don't we folks? 
Winners focus on winning, losers focus on winners.

Stay frosty, centipede!
Sexy white Russian bro-bot here from the midwest, USA, thanks for chiming in, brother! I'd up vote you twice for saying "radical" if I could.

Beep boop bleep bleep.
That's because we're a movement of ideas, totally non-dependent on trivial shit like skin color.

Grab a coat centipede!
Hey, that's not fair. You get the same welcome and love in r/[redacted] and r/all...

HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
But but but but but you're voting against your best interest!!!111!1
Proud after Berner here, let's MAGA! 
To the top! Every race, creed, gender, nationality, and ethnicity is welcome in The_Donald. Nothing triggers the liberals and cucks more than seeing how truly kind and welcoming we are. 
This sub is like a never ending Trump rally welcome to every color of beautiful. 
It's *American.* 
It seems radical because the left has succeeded in dividing us based on the most meaningless things.  We're Americans:  we're on the same boat.  We need everybody to MAGA together! 
OP, you do realize that you are now a privileged white male for supporting Trump right? 

;) 
We love our red pilled black folks. 
This sub is for all Americans. 
"I am a republican,  a black,  dyed in the wool republican,  and I never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress" - Fredrick Douglass.  

Dems and progressives just dont understand american values and the idea of E.plurbis.unum


This is the true America, and we're already seeing it. People welcomed regardless of race or creed, but united under the same goals, common cause, and mutual support.

One nation under, under God, with truth and justice for all. It's amazing how those words somehow seem new and even more important today.
Takes a lot of courage to be a black Trump supporter - props to you, centipede!
tolerant right, intolerant left
People get confused because Trump stands for civic nationalism.  Both black nationalists and white nationalists will like that (including the alt right) although Trump doesn't support those ethno ideologies.  Now the truth is immigration has been FAR too great and a forced demographic change is evil to ANY race.  Still that's been FAR more about cheap labor.  They just call whites racist if they don't like it.  Evil people.   

If the democrats didn't try to pit races against one another, everyone would realize they just want to destroy the middle class (all races) with this influx of cheap labor.

Welcome, fellow Patriot!! 
It is radical... just not Islamic terror 
NEEEEEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AHHHH! Jk were not stupid. Hey welcome
Even though I live in the midwest I've never met a single Trump supporter who was a racist.  I'm sure some are out there, but I've never seen one.  I don't have anything to contribute just wanted to chime in and say that I'm glad you're here, fellow centipede.
Get this patriot an extra warm coat!
WELCOME!! We are not the sister fucking rednecks that the left said we were. 
I prefer Bern victim.
We have the best people, don't we? Don't we have the best people? We have the best people. <3 <3 <3 
You're an anti-semite, reeeeee
The only minority that ever caused me grief, was the democrats.
Radical!?

**REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE**
It's not really welcoming or anything, we just don't care. We care about the ideas. People should do whatever they want and look however they like. Just don't force us to conform to their norm. 
you too man! MAGA
We welcome anyone who sees the light because many of us were in the dark at one point as well. Free tickets for anyone that wants to ride, just know, this train has no brakes. 
A man is judged by the content of his character.
And right back at you, brother. We are not the monsters people say we are. We have the American people's interests at heart. All of us. Of any skin color or creed.
Wait wait wait... So you're saying we're not all white supremacist nazi sexist homophobic fascists? Phew!
Welcome patriot! Registered independent millennial that just couldn't understand wtf the MSM was doing here. I was late to the party also. 
Im not sure I buy this russian bot claim, dont they make sounds more like "VEEP  CHVOOT"

Thanks centipede!!!!  

Welcome lurkers! Feel free to ask questions or any of us, we will gladly back up our arguments with links and facts. 
We are all Americans first! 
Because truth has zero color sir!!

You are a patriot
I've been lurking here for a while, even though I'm not American, because I've just been so fascinated by this sub. I love how positive, welcoming and upbeat you guys are.

It's such a change from where I live in the UK - people won't even allow you to say you like Trump. I've had co-workers argue with me, because I tried to say he won't be the next Hitler. Also apparently he hates England now, too (for some reason). 
Its called being an actual PROGRESSIVE! Not that bs the left, and most of the right keep telling you what is progressive.
Won't see that on the other side.
Radical indeed!
Handsome guy. President Trump. Love it.
These pictures just show how absurd Trump thinks the left is lol
Classic projection. They hate themselves (especially their bloated, pimply faces), so assume everyone hates themselves just as much. Sad!
I say bring it on. We are not an easily offended bunch.I voted for Trump! I make fun of Trump! I also make fun of my own parents for all of the libtard nonsense they spew! 
I love me some funny Trump and they just don't understand how. 
TFW you're channeling Pepe.
They are fuel for our meme war, there are no bad pictures of our God Emperor-Elect President Donald J. Trump
It's hilarious, they're upvoting pictures of Trump to the front page but the whole point of their sub is to stop Trump from getting to the front page. Sad. 
So if a picture of Trump gets a record number of upvotes, will cucks be upset?
How's that working out for him...
will just move this to t_d and get some money flowing asap
Let's help this 'pede out 
If i have the right Web page they do ship.
I wonder if they ship country wide????

Without actual evidence, stein lawyer instead tries to talk about benefits of hand recount over other methods.
Whiny, nasal woman grates.
It looks like the Dems are arguing that "Muh Russians" hacked the election.
This is pretty pathetic, they're practically begging for a hand count, I can almost see the snakes shedding their skin in the courtroom.
JUDGE FINDS NO CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT WOULD REQUIRE A HAND RECOUNT.
The fuck is this loser talking about, they don't have any evidence of tampering, just talking in circles to make it sound like there could possibly have been tampering, any right minded person would tell these idiots to take a hike.
Judge just announced that a verdict WILL be given tonight. I have a post prepped and ready to go as soon as she comes back from court recess.
[removed]
Shit, why does the judge even need to think about it honestly, there is literally zero evidence that there was any tampering and it's blatantly obvious that this entire claim is farcical.
Boom
Wow i'm really surprised she denied them hahahahahahaha!
BTFO
Most refreshing part of the decision (paraphrasing) "I can't speculate; I have to follow the law."
Not working...
Another break then the verdict.
Do they want a civil war? Do they think they have a chance in winning?
SEDITIOUS ASSERTIONS INTENSIFY

This whole farce is just to undermine faith in the election results and cast wild Russian hacking aspersions.
Stein's band of shills are getting ethered here.
Judge to return with her decision after a brief recess.
I'm pissed as fuck this is even happening right now. 
God damn it. Day of the rope when?
Did she go get a happy meal or what?

Trump, once again, was right against the liberal cuck cancer. 
We institutionalize all manner of bad behavior.  That is a part of why Trump is going to be the prez.  I hope to see this problem get addressed in first year of his first term.      
because if this was a real democracy Hillary would be in office. fortunately we live in a republic
Also why does the popular vote matter when the rules have always been that it doesn't and that both candidates knew that going in and weren't trying to win it. 
The popular vote doesn't matter because it's a contest that wasn't held. You don't lose the Super Bowl and complain that you should have won because you got the most first downs. 

Anyone that pretends the voter turnout would have been exactly the same if our elections were dependent on the popular vote is delusional.
THIS MAP IS NOT ACCURATE - please, for the love of Kek, take this shit down and don't make us look like fools for pushing false information.
Glad to say I reside in red. My county has a few loonies but we do well every election.
I'm just amazed that LA County apparently went red

Spez: I think that tiny one in so cal is LA. Or is that orange?
The liberals want California, NYC, Chicago and Mexico to decide our elections.
Ok, a real explanation would be to weigh the color by how the counties voted insteas of who won them. A 48/52 would be purple, which you would see a lot of.

I realize it only matters who won the county, but to see how the country voted you would have to blend the colors.
Because owning more land doesn't mean you have more than one vote. Nonetheless the system we have works and our founding fathers were brilliant for thinking of it. 
I say it every time I see this picture.

#Fucking Massachusetts.
because muh liberal agenda
Every time I see this I can't help but picture Tucker Carlson's smug face haha
All these people bitching about the electoral college need to take a long look at this map, ponder how a constitutional republic is supposed to work, and then realize that the electoral college worked exactly as designed. This is what a representative federal system of government looks like, if they want a pure democracy they're in the wrong country. 
b-b-b-because i called you racist?
Trump did win the popular vote. He won 3,084 out of 3,141 counties of the United States
Holllllyyyy shit. We need to get on this shit immediately!!!!

CNN literally defending burning the American flag - BTFO
The only time a flag should be burned should be in ceremony  retiring the colors.
"I don't want to run in circles...."

wtf? the guy gave a straightforward answer & because it wasnt the answer he was looking for he had to press him on it repeatedly... lol
You can tell that the whole thing was planned by him and his team just to expose the idiocy of networks like CNN. He wants to talk about Cabinet appointments and things that will affect Americans and the "News" host just wants to continuously harp on why we should defend burning the American flag. Played to perfection.
You don't like my answer? That SUUUCKS
"Can we agree that flag burning is protected under the first amendment?"

**"lol no"**
Man they'll site the constitution all day to burn the flag but just can't seem to remember that when it comes to owning firearms. 
I don't want to run in circles but my producer is on the phone with George Soros and telling me in my ear to run in circles.
I think that it should be illegal also
He sees the 10D chess being played.
Fake news should also be illegal...should have tossed that in there for the lulz.

Its hilarious watching the guest, make multiple attempts to provide news only to be continually "gotcha'ed" by the host who couldn't resist
The Flag Protection Act of 2005 was a proposed United States federal law introduced by Senators Bob Bennett (R-UT) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY). The law would have prohibited burning or otherwise destroying and damaging the US flag with the primary purpose of intimidation or inciting immediate violence. It called for a punishment of one year in jail and a fine of $100,000.[1][2][3]
#THEY'RE BITING
That stupid So Called media with propaganda. They are the real asshole! 
Look at this fake interview.  We all know flag burning is not constitutionally-protected.  Free speech is constitutionally-protected.  The supreme court has held that previous attempts at making flag burning illegal crossed into first amendment territory.  That doesn't make flag burning constitutionally-protected.
its illegal in germany to give a nazi salute....but thats okay
Here's the btfo response that would've jacked the media

CNN: "So you know that flag burning is legal as decided by the Supreme Court? You can admit that right?"

Spokesman: "The Supreme Court also determined it is legal to intern Japanese-Americans. Are you telling me you support burning the American flag and interning Americans?" 

CNN: "*PIVOT*" 
Chris Cuomo is an ass-hole but I don't see him stuttering in this video.
In response to Americans burning their own flag...[geeeet out!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6fZZqDJXOVg)
LMAO...what a tool
It should be illegal.  I think a first offense should be a misdemeanor with a large fine and community service, and a repeat offense escalates to jail time.
Look at CNN defending the Constitution. 
Wow,  the only time the left cares about the constitution is to erode it and to have the right to criticize or demoralize america.  
It's funny how we have much bigger issues (like the North Korea nuclear threat) and all CNN wants to talk about is tiny issues like flag burning. They're really good at talking about shit that doesn't really affect the country.
Hahaha

CNN: Trump intentionally endangering all drivers by putting Asian woman in charge of transportation! Stay tuned to find out why the racist, stereotyping President-elect would do such a horrible thing!
Don't be fooled, she is a white racist Russian male in disguise
Wow!  What a bigo....wait, he's a misogen....wait he's racis...  Can't wait to hear what nasty names the left attempts to throw at her.
I also just read she is Mitch McConnell's wife.   Plot twist
Can't resist. Trump truly is the Troll King. Putting an Asian woman in charge of DOT. Much kek
Suspicions have been confirmed, President-elect trump is very sexist! SAD!
Did he just pick a Chinese lady for transportation secretary? This is going to be the best 8 years of our lives.

Because white upper middle class college students think that blacks, other minorities and the poor are too dumb to handle the task of getting state issued ID.

Yeah, I'm not one to bandwagon, but what this guy did is so far beyond unacceptable that he's got to go.  If he worked for me, he'd be gone.  If I did what he did (I wouldn't), I would step down in disgrace.   

You cannot hijack people's submissions and alter them to suit your own narrative - that's fascism of a high order.  I'm not being dramatic when I say that this type of behavior from an executive calls into question the legitimacy of Reddit as a whole.  Given the precedent he set by his actions, Reddit has lost enormous credibility such that its contents are now both suspect and impeachable.
If you could explain to me what he did it would be greatly appreciated. I just haven't done my research yet
Recommended - don't post links with all the token/SMTP relay bullshix, just the hard link.  For those who want it clean:

I feel the need to post this warning: I'm uncertain if we can trust Change.Orgs figure for the petitioners, it doesn't seem to have gone up at all during the 5 hours this has sat and gathered over 400 upvotes for... surely some of those upvoters would have voted? 

Isn't Change.Org Also Owned by.. George Soros?
Clearly the board of directors is failing as well. They company will fail, because the board has proven again and again they do not have good judgement. For example, the Pao catastrophe.

###WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE BEST DEALS, FOLKS
I work at a large, public university. There are many here who were afraid of losing their jobs if they announced that they were voting for Trump. Whenever the election was brought up, people would say "I'm voting for Stein." They put this shit on their fakebook and twatter and what not, but they didn't put on bumperstickers or any of that shit.

I got a pass, of course, because I'm the veteran who served in Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and our local NPR station had already said we were all in for Trump.

Come the day after the election, all these folk who said they were voting for Stein gave me a knowing nod or a fist bump.

I can understand how Stein is baffled. She probably saw a huge uptick in her name being mentioned and is dumbfounded how she got so few votes. I willing to wager that she assumed all those positive mentions were true and that she'd get a larger percent of the popular vote, despite the polls and Harambe.

All of this probably made it much easier for her to accept funding and assistance from Soros. He probably came at her all Palpatine like saying, "Good. Good. Now use that anger to strike down those ballots and you will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine!"
She should do a reeeeeeeee count. I'm counting a lot of reeeeeeees these days. 
Another Zero going kamikaze?
You never know. Maybe she actually won the election (she didn't.)
Either pulling a "Bernie Scam" on the Dems or trying to derail the US Electoral College as a Hillary agent. 
So spicy it burns
Cool reeeeeeeecount Jill, want to bring it to the white house?? We need more green party officials like you to harvest Soros dollars. It's what makes the green party GREAT!  P.S. KEEP DREAMING ABOUT THAT WHITE HOUSE VISIT, loser 
Green Acid obviously. 
$$$$$$
She's trying to do what her kind have always done, undermine society. Some feed on decay and death. Vampires do not literally suck blood, but they steal life.
It's really tough to process details like this when the electoral vote totals are so close, maybe we need to put it in a graph.  /s
She loves plants though.
It could all be a publicity stunt for her and a way to raise money.  They've said the excess money raised will be used for electing Green Party officials.
Too much weed apparently does cause brain damage.
She's in the Green Party.

My guess? Drugs.

Do enough psychoactive drugs and your brain will be permanently fucked. LSD especially.

In before ALM are deemed racist.
The refusal of the youth to acknowledge most of the trending rhetoric is Republican rhetoric saddens me. The RNC is primed to be taken back from twenty five years of religious idiots and we're still mainly hearing rhetoric that amounts to 'bush is dumb'. If the bad people of the Republican party 'scare' you away despite common principles I do not see how you can be any better than the kids at the University of Virginia asking for Thomas Jefferson not to be quotes as he owned slaves.

And Republicans have experience and additional immunity when it comes to fighting 'racist' claims the left tries force into every conversation.
So the mods are now hiding this post? Come on Mods!!

The funny thing is that he was right. The media constantly tries to portray muslims as peace loving.
**SPICY**
He runs them over first though

islime is an ideology of evil.  Hopefully, people will wake up to this fact.

They discovered his true weakness...

#BULLETS
A true pioneer 
He is harsh on terrorism, not Muslims.
He is all being used by many different ideological sides of the issue instead of actually doing it right now is to get the shit we get to come and say something petty like being a smaller proportion of bad things he did is point out that you've got disaffected youths rationalizing their feminism.

Shouldn't we call them illegal Islamic terrorist and not muslims? Just saying...
Hahaha. He has a rally soon. That imagery will be amazing. Also Clinton proposed penalties for flag burning.. Leftists will be cognitive dissonanced as fuck.
Yeah, one of my friends is a die-hard HRC supporter and thinks I give Trump way too much credit because he's a "moron" elected by millions of other racist morons.

And sometimes I think we get carried away with "12D string theory chess" stuff, but then he pulls the flag burning tweet shitposts and I realize the Trump Team is brilliant at this.

Btw, if you want to be extra spicy, take one of Trump's great trolling moments from the GOP primaries (when many libs weren't paying attention), modify the troll such that Jon Stewart or John Oliver "did it," tell your cucked friends, and then after they finish chuckling say, "WHOOPS MY BAD THAT WAS TRUMP LOLOL."
This can't be real.
That has to be fake. I mean I know it's cnn but come on. 
If I didn't know that they actually believe their own #fakenews, I would think CNN was trolling
I agree - it DOES disqualify him.

As an aside, certain groups of people are given grants to own and operate certain types of companies when they come to America. This knowledge was bestowed upon me by my mother and I'm too lazy to further research it, but.

She basically said that the reason we see many convenience stores operated by people from India or nail salons operated by people from Vietnam is because they had financial incentive to run that kind of a store. So it's not racist to believe there is a probability of running into a certain type of owner at a certain type of company. 

That being said. Fuck Joe Biden.

Damn, if this doesn't derail it, imagine what the 2032 presidential election will be like if Scott Adams' prediction comes true.  

With this medical imprisonment we either have the seeds of a broken, neutered Kanye, or a President West who goes Conan the Barbarian on whatever is left of the pre-Trump order. 
They invested millions into him to be a satanic minister, just like Gaga and the rest. They don't take kindly to their MK Ultra drones thinking for themselves and breaking programming. Same thing happened to Britney. Chapelle saw it coming and ran. Miley turned into a circus clown with her tongue handing to the ground. Martin Lawrence went cuckoo. The list goes on and on.

I went through his Twitter profile. Fucking hell... 

Tariq Nasheed chastised a Cuban-American for recounting her experiences with the violent Castro regime. Immediately claimed that her family members were "Batista supporters", as if they deserved it, though he had no evidence and the woman stated that her family opposed Batista, too. Doubts everything that the woman and her family said about their experiences, but then he believes all of Castro's propaganda at face value. He then went on to talk about "racist white Cubans" in the United States, as if this justified the massive human rights violations committed by Fidel Castro and his supporters. I'm a native South Floridian--this would have been the first time I've ever heard of predominantly racist Cuban-Americans, since the population is quite mixed in Miami. 

None of Tariq Nasheed's bigoted assumptions were true, but the thoughts are disgusting enough. He didn't have any evidence, so he conjured it out of thin air in order to defend his beliefs and to persecute Castro's victims. This is what happens when you go full retard on ideology. If it can happen in Cuba, it can happen in the United States.
He's free to go back to Africa if he hates this country. White supremacy must not be terrible for him if he's still able to stay here and afford expensive suits and jewelry.
Tyreek needs to be deported.

He's literally supporting islamic terrorism
Other side of the wall for you!!

Also, who the fuck is Tariq Nasheed?? 
This kind of talk keeps him current, big man on campus, fail 
WEW
Racist Tariq was definitely drunk tweeting last nite. He couldn't spell or form a complete sentence whatsoever. Not that he needed to misspell to look ANY more ignorant.

Edit: Any not Amy
That video was truly idiotic. How the fuck do you think a child would act at 3am in the morning. Even Trump's kids don't have that much energy.
Don't fuck around with Mama Bear.
Lol i'm autistic, Asbergers, I can tell you now the kid was shy, which is pretty normal for any 10 year old no matter who their father is, plus the fact it was 3am so he was probably exhausted.

Fuck Liberals.
Melania said she was going to target online bullying. What a bunch of cucks.
Did he really use that hashtag +StoptheBullying while he bullied a 10year old?

If yes, this is a PRIME-EXAMPLE on how they use words as shields. They say they want to stop bullying, but it's juste a weapon for them to do something and if you call them out they will scream like little biggies and claim that they're the good ones.

If Clinton steals the election, it's war. I mean it. The leftists can no longer be allowed to ruin our society like they do.
I don't even really like Trump, but I'm swaying towards him due to the actions of the democrats. 
This is for views, it's manipulation. Threats of a lawsuit make people want to see it, this kid is a manipulative cunt. 

Notice how he uses #StopTheBullying and then goes on to bully a 10 year old? Sociopath tactics. 

Report the video: Hateful or abusive content / bullying. 
 
Actual video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZAd5Pu9iw4)

Google algos pull videos with enough reports for manual checking, stop this asshole cashing in off bullying a 10 year old.  

rektum
Lmao that people actually believed the bs he said.
dang. melania even more hardcore than trump.
Knee status: Bent
I hope they go for the throat... that's fucking weak
Also, FUCK ROSIE O'DONNELL

Not only is Rosie a horrible parent, but her Twitter is filled with hateful attacks against Barron

Yes - as crazy as it sounds - behemoth O'Donnell is trying to bully a 10yr old boy
Anyone got a link to the apology? 
Cease and desist bitch 
De-fucking-stroyed. 
Even if he was autistic, so what? We going to mock him for it?
It's bullshit. Deleted in 24 hours wtf

Delete it 8 hours ago
Ever been in a 4th or 5th grade class? All the kids clap like that. It's like a joke among them - especially the boys. The"wobbly" walk looks like the kid is limping from a sprained ankle, new shoes, or some other reason. He's fidgety? Welcome to 10-year-old boydom. Won't look at or smile at the crowd? HE'S TEN!! Tell me that you'd be all engaging with an enormous crowd at the age of TEN? These people are complete idiots.
Why does it matter if he is anyway it's no ones buisness but his and those around him, besides arnt people with autism usually smarter than the average person. In any case he's 10 years old back the fuck off or mama trump will crush you.
I'm so pissed that people actually believe this shit. It was late at night, he's not gonna have much of a reaction cause he's a kid and he was fucking tired. And besides even if he did have this condition, why is it anyone else's fucking business to talk about it? I'm sure he wouldn't like it if everyone knew about it cause some Liberal dickheads decided to "stop the bullying". 
Even if he was autistic, what would it matter? Are they just trying to revel in the suffering of others? What business of theirs would it be?

I am completely shocked at how terrible the left in this country has become. So vicious and vile.

Make an example out of this pussy.
Already FLOTUS is stopping cyber bullies

# WINNING MELANIA
Great, now please go after Rosie O'Donuts for defamation too.
I'm 30 and I'm devastated now at 3am. I can only imagine being 10 and in a suit and in front of a crowd. Poor kid probably had to remind himself he wasn't dreaming but he did it to be there for his dad. 
I think it's just some autistic kid that made a misguided and confusing? video thinking it would bring more attention to autism, not realizing he was targeting a minor. 
I have kids. They make weird facial expressions all the time when they are bored and they act lethargic and non-social when they are tired. They are not autistic. Maybe Barron is and maybe he isn't. Publicly making a case that he is autistic when you know nothing about him is certainly not how you #StopTheBullying.
I really want the link to that apology lol
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
I always find it funny how the left uses things like these as "insults".

Like football/wrestling/Male Friendship/Anything Masculine? You're gay!

Black conservative? UNCLE TOM 

Female Conservative? Brainwashed by the patriarchy! 

Believe in Illuminati/Conspiracy? Haha conspiracy theorist (but the patriarchy is a thing!)

Are shy/Intelligent? AUTISTIC!


As a female conservative I've had enough of being told I am not a woman, that I am a slave, that I am "awful" and setting back an entire gender. Why? Because I like to cook and be feminine. Sue me. Sue me for wanting to embrace the things that make me happy, right? 


When a member of the Autism Spectrum Community "comes out" as an advocate, it is their business, and some Autists will make the choice to challenge the sterotypes and stigma. **But normie adults who take it upon themselves publically to "out" or speculate on a child's Spectrum status are just bullying.**  

**WHETHER OR NOT Barron has any kind of challenges, it is his business and he and his family will deal it in love and grace** But to publically call a Child out for any challenge, whether or not they have it, is inexcusable.  **I am more sad for the parents of a Bully than for the parents of any Autist...** 

EDIT: is there  link? I would be interested to see what the actual video was about...

EDIT: Watched video, and will not include out of respect for the family's wishes.  Motivation is unclear, as a section featuring Melania speaking about cyber bullying is included.  However, at the very BEST it is a public call to speculate on a minor child's medical status, and it's WORST it is a public attempt to stigmatize a minor child AND the ASD community.  As a parent, YES I would ask for it to be taken down.  
Cuck bends both knees. 
Look at that reaction. Suing people sure looks fun, Lol. 
With Melania as FLOTUS, something actually might change on the cyber-bullying front. She's a strong woman, and I think she will deliver.
Kid probably has more money than that cuck will make in his entire lifetime lol 
seriously. isnt melania's platform ON CYBER BULLYING??

if liberals werent so retarded I would swear this was a setup...but I just feel in my heart this is genuine
Oh sweet irony.. 
Wow... his display pic... 
Too bad so many people get smeared and don't have the money to get lawyers to stop it.  Good for Trump's, this was really mean to do to a 10 year kid.
Wait...then why couldn't Michelle Obama's lawyer stop those famous "Michelle Obama is a tranny" videos? 
He stars in a Manga, only someone with autism could accomplish that at 10 years old
There won't be any court bc he is taking it down. 
Omfg üòÇ why do liberals all look the same?  
They should also attack YouTube.
and mow the white house lawn every day next year, at least that's how things used to be settled...good ol'choirs 
Ganging up on a 10 year old kid is FUCKING LOW and bestial behaviour. Shame on him!!! (Or her, hard to tell...)
I saw this video in my recommended like 10 times. Almost watched it several times, because I couldn't tell if it was throwing in with the Rosie crowd or not. Now that I know though, glad I didn't give it my whole 1 view. 
When I look at Barron I see my youngest. His movements, facial expressions etc is so familiar to me. He is now in an Ivy League school. Don't f*** with somebody's kid. 
While I never seen the video, the disinformation worked on me. I thought he was autistic. Fake news!
[removed]
How does Melania's foot feel jammed up your ass, liberal douchenozzle?
Jesus buddha yahweh, the comments are cancer
Is it a video debunking that he is autistic? I don't get it. Why the stop bullying tag?
While the video is terrible, such legal bullying is worse.

But it's most likely a lie to get more views. I hope that's the case.
We have always been at war with Eurasia.
This is some 9000 D chess right here!
They have tremendous hypocrisy. Believe me.
I think I get it. Only ban what they dont like to hear. Thats cool right?
Always defend the 1st. I suspect the flag burning tweet is something he isn't serious about just wants to rile up liberals.

Depends on the student. For the partiers who skip class, definitely. And for those who let the liberal professors brainwash them without studying any opposing viewpoints outside of class, often so as well.
How many people has Trump now personally murdered in extrajudicial political killings?

I lost count.

the correct answer is to depress neither button.
Again, these people have no qualm's pushing both buttons.
This dude needs to be in the administration in some form. 
And there's the tell.  Trump's plan all along.  Put the Sheriff in charge and push for voter ID laws.

Thanks, guy!  

Here's a little secret: even we don't see 100% eye to eye on everything.  We still love each other, and our country.  That's why we won  ;)
The rhetoric on reddit actually kept me from even visiting this dom for the longest. I finally came here just out of curiosity, and I haven't been back to the rest of reddit since.

The discussions AND disagreements here are carried out in a civil manner. Holy shit, that's refreshing. 

The community is inclusive, not exclusive. You don't have to be part of a hivemind to participate as long as you're civil.

The shitposts are entertaining, savage, and clever.

I fucking love this place.
> And most importantly I salute the fact that you're not going away just because everyone tells you that you should.

The most important part to note is that we exist because we had our voices taken.  It wasn't just them "telling us that we should go away," no.. we were banned, locked, threatened, had our opinions turned into comment graveyards and were generally mocked by people in positions of power.  Power mods, admins, the lying MSM, all were against us, and yet we still won.  They're about to try to kill us.  Gizmodo and Kotaku have both issued articles about us today, both of which attack us unfairly.  The suspicion is that spez tapped a shoulder to get the articles published in unison to make it appear like he has no choice but to target us.  This, will be a grave mistake if he goes ahead with his obvious plot.
Thanks. However by simply posting here you've been banned from several other subreddits, sorry about that.

You might as well stop fighting it and let the memes flow.

Getting red pilled can be frightening and overwhelming but we try to make it fun. The Pepes, Wojaks, etc. are our fun way of getting people curious as to what the red pill tastes like. 
Once this sub reddit takes hold of you there is no letting go. I havent been on another reddit in months and i have no plans to. Grab a coat, grab a Yuengling and watch the memes flow.
Wherever you live, bud, the same battle will be fought. Don't side with the Totalitarian Globo-Communists in your country, just because you've always voted for the liberal party, or because the media has always portrayed nationalists and patriots as racists, assholes, and christian ideologues. 

I have always been a supporter of Liberty first, above all else. You must be as well. There will soon come a day when you may need to side with someone who has financial policies you don't necessarily agree with, or on whom certain amounts of negligible dirt will be dug up, or who might be made to look like an imbecile by the media. You may need to stand against a globalist who preaches economic policies that actually sound good to you.

Because it would make more sense to side with even a well intentioned idiot, than with someone who has demonstrably evil motives and who serves the interests of a power-hungry globalist elite criminal banking cabal.
We are not a rotten place of sexists, homophobes, nationalist and racist.

This is one big MEME MACHINE. We are completely self-aware about how we come across. Its just memery, on a mission to turn every thing trump does and says into a meme. We memed a man straight into the god-damned white house. we are the masters of MEME MAGIC.

We are destroying the establishment through irony, memes and upvotes. And god damn, it feels good. Even if you think Trump is a buffoon, you might find the atmosphere here to be more than enjoyable to be worth being confused as ONE OF US. Everyone is welcome. You are eurofag? Have a coat, for any patriot is a good patriot. Trans? Feel free to use any bathroom you want on the TRAIN WITH NO BRAKES. Gay? We always respect a man with good taste. Black? Welcome to da hood of reddit. Female? Well, I'm afraid that can't be because the left assured me that there are no women voting for Trump.


Frankly, i was neutral, and still am (though his 4D chess moves have make me hold Trump into higher regard). But fuck, if this place isn't the most amusing place on this entire godforsaken website, then i don't know what is.

Thank you! It feels sometimes as though you woke up one day and the whole world had changed and turned upside down. This place helps us all keep our sanity. Hopefully, things will change for the better, and more people will wake up to the crisis on the door step.
Welcome fellow person banned by enoughtrumpspam.
Welcome to the family, where you'll be fed memes and facts on a daily basis, a truly healthy diet. 


The downvotes you'll get are from brigaders and random people that leak in from /r/all. 

It's good to get new blood for the fight. Welcome aboard. 
Other sites on reddit down voted me and trolled me for being Conservative and disagreeing with tgem.  Here, I read posts I agree with, get up voted and actually feel a part of the community  Don't go anywhere else anymore because anywhere else I'm an outsider.
I oppose this so much but the logic is sound.

I agree with them. It's tyrannical bullshit to have laws prohibiting flag burning. Trump having his opinion is fine. I just take it as a sign of healthy patriotism and move on. It won't turn into law. That is the beauty of the first amendment. 
Interesting. Finland, Switzerland and New Zealand have some of the most progressive laws in the world and all three are held in pretty high regard. I suspect their citizens wouldn't care either way. It's kind of funny that lefties are calling countries which have all the things they want facist. 
They are states with inferior protection of the most important of all rights - Freedom of Speech.  
Criminalizing flag burning is authoritarian. They're not wrong.
Yeah, and none of these place have real freedom of speech.
I'm Portuguese and the notion of burning the national flag is so abhorent that I have never even heard of any such case here. While I do agree that the right to free speech is a must have in every nation, burning the flag is really low and it shouldn't be legal or illegal it should just be a very shamefull thing to do.
And that's why America is better than all of them. First amendment babyyyyyy

You have to be pretty bad at lying to be a liberal and get ousted by politifact.
You know what that means, if Politifact is saying it's not true, the Democrats were likely tampering with them.
Never trust Politifacts. Technically those machines are outlawed in some states.
(((politifact)))
Fuck politifact though.  I don't think we should cite them when they are so cucked the other 99% of the time
Oh. It must be true then.
The fact that the MSM, including PoliFact, have downplayed this so much makes it so obvious that the Clinton campaign wasn't behind this and actually want it shut down to prevent their vote fraud from being uncovered. Though it doesn't explain the $5mil+ out of nowhere.
PolitiFraud is owned and operated by Poynter, who also owns and operates the *Tampa Bay Times*, which happened to endorse Cuntface for 2016...

The good news is they won't be the only 'mob' there.  Bikers for Trump plan a massive ride to the inauguration to make sure everything goes off smoothly.

http://conservativetribune.com/bikers-for-trump-most-epic-ride/
When is he NOT planning an evil scheme?
There will be paid agitators that will attempt to incite violence on both sides. Don't forget Scott Foval. Soros would love nothing more than a counter protest and for violence to break out. We've got Trump in, why the hell would we protest? Ignore and discredit these rioters. Go to the inauguration, enjoy the day, shitpost on social media, don't create opportunities for Soros. 

Keep spending Soros money, eventually he'll lose interest.  Then she'll be packing her bags back to Irrelevantville USA. Hillary is her neighbor
Call Georg-y Soros, 877-CASH-NOW!
"It's my money and I need it now!!" - Jill 'Crazy lady' Stein
Amen.  I'm with you.
Trump has a plan he knows what he's doing....
Gotta be something up with it, he's very public about it and he's been pretty silent on his other picks so far
It's fine. Trump is planning on giving him SoS and firing him. He is doing it so the globalists fall in line before inauguration and to stop any sort of riots they would help. They are just as bad as soros.
Just look at Romey. It's clear Trump wears the pants. He would make a great sos. Keep your enemies closer and all...
I think Romney hurt himself way more than he could ever hurt Trump during the election.  I would liken him to Wiley Coyote trying to use ACME traps on the Road Runner.  He only ended up blowing himself up with the trap he set for trump lol. 
 
But seriously, I think what we have here is Trump truly weighing Romney on his merits (and he does have some) we should be prepared if he picks him.  We have to trust the guy who can see all of the chess board and not just pieces IMO.  If he picks him, it will be for good reasons.

If I had the money I'd pay people to jump out from behind corners to scare Soros all day long. 
From what I remember of those leaks, it was pages and pages of corporate-speak about the directions of the different foundations, all using empty, obscure words that didn't really incriminate anyone. Nothing anywhere about evil thumb twiddling, more like paving the road to hell kinda stuff.
Interesting. Thank you. 
Well this is fucked, but has he actually done anything illegal? Or is he just too rich to prosecute?

You are only allowed to burn flags made in the US. Burning those made in China or Philippines would get you in trouble. This keeps the money stateside.

She paid the 3.5 million to WI. She isn't doing this for money and this narrative NEEDS TO STOP. She is a soros puppet who is either being blackmailed, threatened or wants to help soros stop Trump.

She either really good at playing dumb it is really dumb. She new what the fees were. The crazy part is if she asks for more money, some idiots will donate it.

It's funny because that sub reddit automatically bans everyone who posts in /r/The_Donald.. They have a huge circle jerk of "see, no Trumpers replying. Complete silence" when in fact we can't reply unless we make another account just to reply. They're so easy to debunk that we must be banned to prevent them looking stupid in their comment section. 
Libtards are hypocritical as fuck

You expect them to actually do research themselves??? Cute... Lol
They're getting BTFO in their own thread.

BTW, they talk about brigading from here, but this sub never ever links to other threads or comments. Pretty sure automod is set to delete posts that do automatically.

Yet in that very thread where they criticize /r/The_donald, there were many links to this domreddit, including posts from today, and many other non-archived posts that could still be voted on.

Just more of them accusing /r/The_Donald of what they do.
Hahaha holy shit

Not great on fact checking but my God they're fiesty.
Hmmm seems like leftists only care about policemen when they are killed by white men AND T_D is "silent"  about it. 

Seems like very specific criteria, doesn't it?

EnoughTrumpSpam is just paid and unpaid CTR shills. I feel sorry for them. 

Problem is when you are a part of a losing battle, is you need to lie in order to regain some sort of motivation. The thing about that is, in time people learn the truth and you end up losing harder.

And the hell are they talking about mentioning right wing? We're against Muslim terrorism and nobody gets more right wing than those guys. Why is the rest of Reddit ready to dispose of the idea that their social, political, ideological, and religious arch enemies might be somehow responsible (and if not for this, then for countless other incidents)? 
Maybe they'd have heard us if the algorithm didn't keep us off the front page so much.
"Well I thought they wouldn't say anything, so I just assumed they didn't"

I live near where the killings took place. Found out about in bright and early on r/T_D. Didn't even get a chance to turn on the T.V.

Fronts page, ahoy! R/all needs to see this!
They're very willing to throw around the word terrorist if it serves their agenda.
Except it wasn't though. 
Hey I fully agree.  Have a beer and chill.  It is best to avoid looking stupidity directly in the eye. We know it exists because people supported Hillary but we don't bring it home with us. 
Their latest bright idea is to burn the confederate flag because it supposedly will upset us MORE since we are all racist, sexist, homophobic, etc.

They don't follow through with the their thinking because this will result in increased sales of confederate flags (which they will then no doubt pin on us, rather than themselves), and is tantamount to burning something that by and large does not represent our beliefs and our country as a whole.

So the question then becomes "what are all you regressives doing hoarding all those confederate flags??"

Imagine it: They just got to college and are eager to virtue signal to everyone in their dorm, so they invite their new first black friend over. New black friend sees the SJW Freshman with a confederate flag. New black friend asks why. Then the SJW has to scramble to explain it was saving it for later so that it could burn it! No really! Wait come back New black friend!
If having a Confederate flag in any context is treasonous. Is there any point where Burning the American flag and shouting not my President is not protected free speech?
I think it's the fact that these SJWs burn the flag over perceived injustices, not true injustices. Rewind to the 1960s. If someone in an MLK march burned the American flag, that was a true statement. Back when people had true pride in America, that action showed their heartbreak with their beloved country. Because like OP says, THEY understood the symbolism, and used that symbolism to make a powerful statement. Not a statement of "woe is me", but a statement showing their heartbreak. Curtailing any freedom of speech is a slippery slope. Though I agree their logic is flawed when it comes to which flag and statement is acceptable. 
Burning the flag does and neans nothing, but having a president who threatens to jail because of flag burning is a different story. 

Aside from the constitutional infringement, trump's declaration mirrors rulers in countries whi have 0 rights. 

I know that this is a very pro- trump sub. But I hope some of you realize the seriousness of the things he says.  You cannot jail/ deport flag burners, it is actually very unconstitutional. 

Edit: words
Burning the flag of our nation (outside of disposing a worn one) is a signal that you are a fucking traitor

Punishment should be execution via firing squad. This is the UNITED STATES. The most epic fucking place in the world.

We can order beer to be delivered 24/7 and eat hot dogs. With fucking MUSTARD

We have CHEESEBURGERS. Other countries don't have that shit, and if they do it's a cheap knockoff

Our women do PORN on screen, and if you play them right they will act out any sexual fantasy you want as long as you make them love you

We have the best military. Like you do not want to go to war with us, You will Lose. END OF STORY.

And we have fucking guns. 

Why would you hate us so much that you need to burn our flag?

Trump was doing five rally's a day because he ACCTTUALLY wanted to lose.

Idiots is too kind of a word to describe these morons.
I don't know about you guys, but I always spend nearly 100 million dollars of my own money when I don't want to win something.
Dumbass watches South Park
Trump should retweet this article and talk about how he's going to improve the lives of Americans living with mental illness. 
How fucking delusional are these people? Where do they come up with this shit? Lol
Less than 1% difference in PV count, some "huge margin", not that it matters in the GE Electoral contest.
sounds like he is projecting 
My brain short circuited reading that, just like Hillary's did after drinking iced chai latte.
The media has continually insisted he didn't want to win, just grow his business.   Except both Trump and his family were LOSING business throughout the entire campaign.   WHY would he continue being trashed and scrutinized in the press and allow his family to be harassed if he only wanted to lose?   The media are largely irrational and ridiculous.  Sadly people eat this up.
What do these people think Trump's been doing all these years? Sitting around saying "Oh gee, I sure wish I *wasn't* President."?
# [CNN Right Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeYsTmIzjkw)
Losers aren't winners; losers are whinny-whiners.
They quite literally don't know how to win. 
This is some Trudeau-level shit right here:

**"If you beat your enemies and win, you actually lost."**
What...
Don't think he ran to lose.
I love that liberal narrative. So many libtards were saying Trump would drop out, that he was running as a gag to increase awareness for his business, and that he didn't want to be president. 

And still, even as president elect, I have friends that expect him to leave and hand over the presidency to Mike Pence because it was his plan "all along." Fucking what?

Liberals have gotten so used to losing and jumping hoops for illogic that they have completely lost all credibility or shred of rational thought. It's incredible.

Does anyone know what Trump was yelling?
Romney is more of a wussy than a pussy

When I first saw that clip...I said the memes would be endless.. Trump giving us ammo lol
Mitt's a very unattractive woman
What is going on in this picture? 
Pictured: Donald Trump boos the Honky Tonk Man on his way to the ring.
Oh oh my sides hurt. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Can someone explain to me why Donald is even considering Romney after all the shit he said about him during the campaign?
PLEASE NOT MITT. I won't be able to forgive Trump if he goes with Mitt. Dammit!
While Trump is right to be mad at kellyanne conway for going rogue, I actually agree with her. Romney tried to destroy Trump when he should have endorsed Trump, Trump fucking endorsed Romney back in 2012 and Romney returned the favor by being a jackass. I hope he doesn't pick Romney. 
HAH, GAYYYYYYY!
Ill grab it anytime for you donald 
this picture will be circulating our entire lives
For a good looking rich man I don't think Romney has much pussy grabbing experience at all.
the hilariousness of you pedes simply slays me

If Mitt gets on his knees and begs this reddit forgiveness, will you accept it?

Eh, I'm in the 33% then.  Freedom of speech cases have been and should be adjudicated toward maximal freedom.  We do this

> not because all speech is good, but because the temptation to ban speech is so great that, unless given a blanket prohibition, it would slide into universal censorship of any unpopular opinion.

-Scott Alexander
As long as we have laws on Hate Speech burning of the flag needs to be #1 on that list.
"Freedom of Speech" was never meant to protect the majority. FULL STOP.
The protection of flag burning as legitimate speach is one of my favorite things about the First Amendment. So few other things better encapsulate the "we're better than you" attitude to dissidents and other countries. 

We are so assured of ourselves and our righteousness as a nation and people that you can desecrate a flag all you want. Your gesture will ring hollow. In our great free market of ideas, no one is buying yours because they are the feeble cries of a child throwing a tantrum. That's why the left is so pro-censorship now. Their ideas are terrible and the only way to preserve them is to label dissent as "hate speach". 

The only people who should fear speach are those whose ideas don't stand up to scrutiny. We are better than that, and we are better than them.
I am in the 33%. I detest abusing the flag, but that is my problem. Men have died to uphold what that flag stands for. This was seriously a test for me on how my worldview held up to what I claimed to believe. My worldview lost the battle on this one, because I believe in the freedom to express themselves. 

The problem is, it's the concept behind the flag not the flag itself. I cannot make the step to punish those that abuse it. The irony is lost on them that the very system they are protesting by burning the flag is the very system that allows them to do it in the first place. There is a bittersweet beauty to that. 
The Bill of Rights was written to protect against such scenarios -- to prevent the tyranny of the majority. Love Trump but hate that tweet of his. Strongly disagree with him on this. 
Burning a flag isn't a form of speech. It's not protected under the 1st Amendment.

Burning a flag is closer to incitement of violence and sedition than anything else.

The SCOTUS ruling was a 5-4 decision. It can and hopefully will be revisited.
I'm not sure I would want a law *specifically* against flag burning. I'm more concerned about the context. Depending on the situation, I would call it a rallying cry for treason or insurrection, and that can't be tolerated in *any* country. 
Keep it legal. I want to know who's a commie traitor and who isn't.
Some of the worst stickies I have ever seen while the live stream of the Wisconsin recount hearing was taking place.  

Honestly a Trump Babe stickied?
Agreed, the Don Tzu is a quality shit post worthy of sticky. The MS Paint sticky can go. One quality shit post and one info post imho.
I think they know Trump's picks have been controversial among the community and just don't want us fighting within ourselves.
There are a LOT of mods for this sub so I think what often happens is the mods "out-sticky" each other.
I was also wondering about this earlier. Mods do a good job a lot of the time but today they haven't been stickying big news articles

Update: They stickied the Wisconsin judge's ruling. Mods must have been listening
Agreed. As this sub takes a lot of pride in the fact that Trump has people who lurk around here. Memes are fun and all but the priority should definitely be placed on important information and substantive discussion. 
Hi,

Next time send us a mod mail. It's not always easy to find a good post to sticky, we do our best. 

There's also a lot of other factors that go into whether or not we sticky something like timing for example. Sometimes theres things that we would like to sticky but cant.

Thanks!
WHAT DID HARAMBE KNOW ABOUT THE CLINTON FOUNDATION?
Good try. Everyone knows that the dead vote Democrat. 
is this real? /s
Election Night. Super Tuesday, 2016. I was excited. I couldn‚Äôt wait for her to get in. I was ready to end centuries of the unfair oppression white men have done to women and minorities. I weep every day that I‚Äôm a white male. I cry. I apologize. But tonight, tonight it WILL BE HER TURN. I decided to take my allowance money earned from my parents and ride my bicycle to the grocery store. Tonight is special, I decided to go for the name brand extra crispy chicken tenders. I already had my favorite dipping sauces in order: buffalo hot sauce (wimpy flavor), barbeque sauce, ketchup and liberal tears of oppression. (I usually go for one dipping sauce per night, but this was a special occasion). You Drumpf supporters were finally going to realize I WAS RIGHT, DRUMPF WAS WRONG. But then‚Ä¶.the wins were coming in. The electoral votes were sweeping in. I was getting nervous, but I knew based on my research that Hillary was going to win. Look, I‚Äôm a pretty smart guy. I always go to the right unbiased news sources (HuffPost, WashingtonPost, CNN, etc.) because I know all other sources are wrong. But then Trump won Ohio, Florida‚Ä¶.and he won the night with the rust belt. I just don‚Äôt get it. I don‚Äôt understand how someone can have a different opinion than me. I guess racism, homophobia, facism and xenophobia won that night. If you didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary you are sexist. I weep. I weep because of how bad the economy is. My degree in psychology hasn‚Äôt landed me a job. I‚Äôm 125k in debt because of my psychology degree. It‚Äôs not my fault. You got your Drumpf. You made your bed you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Drumpf supporters. Now lay in it. 
How am I not 50 points ahead you ask?

If we are to believe what they say, it would literally have to be an act of god.  God hates them.  It's the only answer.
Sally Kohn looks like how I'd imagine a guy would look if he never entered puberty in his life.
Someone asked "who are these guys?", but by the time I responded, their post had been deleted, so I'm entering this as its own comment:

* I think the one on the lower right is a recurring actor on American Horror Story. His name was [Tate](https://youtu.be/2q0Fbo6o9es) in the first season. 

* The one on the upper right is [Dan Savage](https://youtu.be/KViLILyV03w). 

* [Julian Assange](https://youtu.be/k9xbokQO4M0) is behind the dude freaking out.  

* The dude freaking out is [James Carville](https://youtu.be/41EMt99elCU). 

* The one on the left is [Huma Abedin](https://youtu.be/qC3F5Kcn01c) after several nights of crying and with no makeup.
A lifetime of frustration, passive aggression and failed ambition within those pained eyes.

Oh, and the angrily triggered SJW to the left looks psycho.
[Sally Kohn trying to explain President Trump](https://youtu.be/Yio3CtrN5WA)
I had never been so sure but unsure of something before. I just knew Trump would win because I looked at the rally crowds and have a brain. Trump had all the momentum & excitement behind him. But I thought they might try to rig it, or people would wimp out at the polls and vote Clinton.

That's the one great thing about flag burning, you immediately know that the protest no longer needs to be taken seriously.  They stop being "liberals" and become "leftist assholes" the moment they pull out that lighter.
yea right on cue for his victory tour, he synced the 2, it's brilliant, keep framing them assholes
#Not enough font size for THIS /\#
Polling of public opinion shows the large majority (I think ~70%) of citizens are against flag burning as a form of protest. Even the most anti-trump people I know still say stuff like "burning the flag is just a dick move. it doesn't prove anything other than you're an asshole".
I don't think you are far off on that prediction.. Liberals....
The media has no clue.
and then the far side of the right will be burning every flag ofbevery group the left holds dear and tell them to deal with it, there's precedent 
Shouldn't the EPA require proper air scrubbers any time a flag is burned ?
What's the unifying component of this strategy though? It seems divisive, meaning it must not be.
It is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.

That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.

First: I am going to institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.

Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.

Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.

Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.

Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in elections.

Ranking of Elitist/Ruling Class Power
1. Globalism
2. Nationalism
3. Federalism
4. Localism
5. Individualism

American Nationalism is a mix of federalism and individualism. It's confusing but 'Americanism' is not European style nationalism from 100 years ago. He doesn't use the word Nationalist because he is probably aware of the ambiguity of the word.

Trump believes in federalism - state's rights on social issues and nationalism on trade & national security. He's a philosophical individualist (based on his business/success books). He even cites (Emerson & Thoreau) and writes as an individualist.

The only proper place of sovereignty is property (rights) or the individual. However, protection/security of property and of individuals (arguably) requires some remove of sovereignty to localism or federalism. Globalism is not necessary.

Not even sure how you could support Trump and hold these views. He's always been pro-police. 
This happened in my town.  The community came together in a HUGE way afterwards.  Tens of thousands of dollars were donated to both families of the police officers.  Almost everyone has blue strips of tape across their back windshields of their cars to show support.

I don't want anyone to be murdered for any reason.  Yesterday's attack was tragic.

We should think and discuss what letting so many refugees in means for America, we need to look at how it's effecting Europe.  We need to look at the arguments against it too from the neighboring countries that aren't letting people in. What are the pros and cons, what can we do? And we need the MSM to stop working people up so they freak out an do horrible stuff like this.
NO, fuck them...

Looks like he had the same motive as BLM supporters who killed cops: some delusional bullshit conspiracy theory that the police were out to get him.
It's sickening how much ets are getting off on this. Even though there were multiple posts about it here. They love the fact he was white, it's like some weird cuck fetish. If he wasn't white they would be defending him.

She just can't figure out why the government won't just pay for it. That's the funniest thing. She is crying about the outrageous changes in price, but that's how it works. She is trying to buy a recount, and they set the price. She expects the Wisconsin taxpayers to just pay for it themselves even though they have already done their part and voted. Typical leftist who doesn't understand that things cost money and you can't expect everyone else to pay for it forever.

Fun fact about that scene, harrison ford was actually scripted to engage in a long sword fight but got sick the night before and was too exhausted to do it so they improved this scene instead. Ended up working out much better and really seems like one of the most prominent character defining moments of indiana jones. 

On that topic, in the movie the fugitive (staring harrison ford and billy lee jones), the most famous scene, billy lee jones is also said to have improved the defining line, when ford says "I didn't kill my wife" and jones responds "...I don't care" (at gun point), forcing ford to jump off of a dam.

And to tie it all together, did you know Trump was in Home Alone 2!

Fun fact that as far as I know is true:

Harrison Ford had diarrhea or something similar during the filming of this scene and improvised this to end the scene quicker.
I LOVE you pedes.
Fun fact about this post, numerous people have pointed out that this scene replaced a big fight scene, as Harrison Ford was ill at the time of filming and wanted to get back to recovering from dysentery instead of running and jumping around in a drawn out sword fight.

I remember as a boy sitting in the cinema here in England when this first came out and that happened in the movie. 

The reason I remember it so clearly is because we all absolutely nearly died laughing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I mean every single person in the cinema. Another thing I will never forget was when Elliot pulled back the reeds and met ET for the first and both of them screamed. I was only the same age as Gerty / Drew Barrymore, and I was so freaked out, I was crying in terror, but was fine after the shock. I had a love / terrified relationship with ET, loved him, but all my ET stuff had to be hidden at night and I used to shit myself that he was going to come into my room and visit me. LOL.

Another film I loved was the Goonies.

Thats the America I love. F**k the 'new improved' version, with attacks like this by a Somali.
Not a supporter of Trump, but I find this thing fucking hilarious.

I find it hard to comprehend how liberals are opposed to the actions taken By this hero. But completely turn their heads when Obama has drone striked hospitals, weddings, etc on accident 
Fun fact. In that scene Harrison Ford was suppose to get into a sword fight with the guy in the original script. However, Ford was riddled with sickness at the time so they decided to just have him shoot the guy instead so they wouldn't fall behind schedule. If you look at Ford he doesn't look well at all and he could barely stand at the time for that scene. 
wasnt all those onlookers in that scene real locals just joining in on the filming?
Few things:    
First off, thanks for this because even though I have an essay to write within the next 14 hours or so, my step-dad has all Indiana Jones on blu ray and I'm seriously tempted right now.    
Secondly, apparently Ford was really feeling under the weather during this shoot and he was supposed to have a huge sword fight production with this guy and get cut up and dramatically stab him in the end but Ford had the idea to make it funny instead - and in doing so, let him get back to rest up and feel better - so he convinced the producers to let him shoot the guy arguing that Jones was running out of time and would not have had an epic duel under these circumstances

This is a great scene. Almost didn't happen supposedly. Was supposed to be a fight scene but Harrison Ford was sick that week of filming with the flu or something. Apparently even the extra sweat was from that too. 

However, I'm not completely sure one of my older siblings didn't make that up when I was young, and I'm not going to look for a source either. So pretty much CNN should give me my own show.

**BLUE LIVES MATTER**
Fun fact, he was supposed to fight him but he had diarrhea that day and improvised. 
Fun Fact that scene wasnt in the original script. Harrison Ford wasnt feeling well that day as he was having diarrhea problems. As they could not do a lengthy fight scene so they improvised.

If I remember correctly, this scene was actually supposed to be an elaborate sword fight, but Harrison Ford was sick and had a fever. So he ad libbed this in, and Spielberg liked it so he left it.  

Love this film.  
Damn. That was clever.
Supposedly they had some intricate fight planned out for that scene but Harrison Ford was sick and at the last second didn't feel like doing it so he improvised the shot. They liked it so much they just kept it in.
Man I love this so much!
Ohhh he didn't see that coming
Harrison Ford adlibbed that scene; the script called for a knife and whip fight.

The NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is a devout globalist plug.
From the wiki:  ...Roger Stokoe Goodell was born in Jamestown, New York,[5] the son of United States Senator Charles Ellsworth Goodell of New York, and Jean (Rice) Goodell of Buffalo, New York... 
Once you connect Billyboy Goodell to his family ties to politics, it becomes clear that the war on police, and American law, and order via BLM, Kaepernick, etc, are just part of the big globalist plan.  Kaepernick isn't some "lone wolf" rebelling against "American oppression" while kissing Fidel Castro's ass.  He is a tool of the globalist agenda, as is Goodell.  That's why he hasn't been put in his place yet.

The 49ers should realize that. Not because he's a political moron, but because he sucks at football.
Trump should announce that since the NFL will not compel their employees to support the USA, that he will no longer have the US government do any favors for the NFL.   No sanctions, just treat the NFL like any other company.   

Week 1 - No flyovers or honor guards.  No big deal but symbolism counts for something or there wouldn't be any protests.

Week 2 - Remove protection from antitrust laws.   All those salary caps, revenue sharing, and anti-competitive media deals will need to go.   

Week 3 - NFL meet OSHA.   Any other company would be in real trouble if their employees kept running into each other and often times getting injured.  Just like any other company the NFL will need to be OSHA compliant for all their employees.  Yep no more of those employee collisions.  At a minimum you will need to fill out an OSHA report for every single time two of their employees collide while doing their job.  That should be a ton of fun.

Or they can get on their feet for the national anthem and show some respect for the US government.   In return the government will allow them to retain all the special privileges, legal exceptions and protections granted the NFL by the US government.

Start watching hockey. Much better sport than football, and you get benched if you do anything other than stand during our anthem.
Nick Cannon about to be admitted to psychiatric ward. 
Props to Nick for speaking up because he must be aware of all the flak he's gonna catch for speaking the truth to these liberals.
I caught TMZ talking about this. All the young cucks on there were horrified by his PP eugenics comments, like he's completely insane, which he's not. Nic has taken the red-pill on this issue.

I also see that wikipedia has cleaned up it's entry for PP founder Margaret Sanger to de-emphasize, and even hide her stated beliefs in eugenics concepts. The truth is out there, even if they try to hide it.
Didn't he join BLM and protested at the GOP convention?  I member. 
Actually guys he thinks its eugenics bc PPs are within walking distances from Black/Latino neighborhoods thus governmental white supremacy program.

Stop circle jerking this idiot.

"Rachel Sklar is a New York-based writer and co-founder of Change the Ratio, which aims to increase visibility and opportunity for women in tech and new media"

Translation: she's a fucking retard.
I got half way through and couldn't take anymore. I checked a couple of the hyperlinks and they went to CNN Politics and NYT. This is pancaked bull shit of the 1st order. Also, she is a rabid SJW:

>Editor\'s Note: Rachel Sklar is a New York-based writer and co-founder of Change the Ratio, which aims to increase visibility and opportunity for women in tech and new media, and TheLi.st, a network and media platform for women. She was a volunteer for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The views expressed are her own.
Nothing to see here, just CNN literally publishing a propaganda piece written by a part of the Hillary campaign.

Great day!
Just a Tuesday in Trumps world. 
There will be no such thing as a "slow news day" in the Trump Administration!  

NO BRAKES!!
Today was a good day.
Tired of winning? 
Too bad!
No Brakes!
THIS POST GIVES ME A BONER BIGLY
i can't wait till after Trumps first one hundred days, 

and the media is forced to compare Trump vs Obama's 

100 day list of accomplishments :D 
And the hand count in WI was DENIED!
And we can look forward to almost 3,000 more!
Shouldn't Islam be the weapon, and liberalism cocking it? Maybe I'm overanalyzing it.
Can a cartoon be more true than this?  (No)
"THAT'S RACIST!" - People who simply refuse to take off their rose tinted glasses and see Islam for what it really is. Islam is the enemy of liberty, the enemy of liberal ideals, the enemy of western society, the enemy of free thought.

Individual Muslim people are victims. Victims of the oppression of Islam.
Fuck this I'm pissed. 
That gave me chills! It's spot on!
Very subtle
In all fairness, I expect Trump to do enough to keep the US safe. The question is if Europe can be saved from itself.
Some cartoons make you sad because of their truth.

This.
Know the signs. 
The Democrats play 1D checkers....there's white and black, so clearly you're racist.

Unfortunately, saying that the problem is radical Islamic terrorism is an understatement.  The true problem is Islam itself, which needs to undergo a reformation very quickly, as it is incompatible with civilized western society.
I have a solution for this.  Let's impose Sharia law in San Fransico.  I bet the "progressives" have a quick change of heart.
the problem isn't radical islam, islam is always radical, it's just the regular islam.

keep in mind: 

crucify and amputate non-muslims, Quran 8:12, 47:4

kill those who insult islam or mohammed, Quran 33:57

kill anyone who leaves islam, Quran 2:217, 4:89

behead non-muslims, Quran 8:12, 47:4

fight non-muslims, even if you don't want to, Quran 2:216

kill non-muslims for not converting to islam, Quran 9:29

extort non-muslims to keep islam strong, Quran 9:29
Islam is the problem and needs to be removed from earth
Period
Terrorism will never stop until Islam is reformed. Their book literally encourages the killing of infidels and disownership of polytheists even amongst family. The reason I believe that while most Islamists are not terrorists, encourage the attacks, is because there is never a call for reformation from Imans and leaders of Islam. 
ok we know the problem now we just need a solution. The only solution I can see is a blanket ban on muslim immigration. They've turned their own countries into bombed out warzones - don't let them do the same to the West
**The problem is Islam.**

It is radical by its very nature.
They play to the left.  Befriend us, act peaceful, say the radical ones are different and that there are peaceful ones.  Bullshit.  They are using our kindness to get a foothold into our way of life and once they get control its over...we slowly over time become the countries that throw gays off buildings and stone women.  It needs to stop....go back to those countries if Sharia law works so well.
It blows my mind that people can find the common denominator when it comes to math, but not when it comes to multiple Islamic terror attacks.
nonono. i read huffpo. the problem is definitely trucks.
# Say it loud, say it proud. 
The problem is also the globalist military industrial complex recklessly intervening in Muslim countries. It plays right into their worldview of Muslims vs. Infidels and throws infinite fuel on the fire.

We need to clean up the ISIS mess that Bush and Obama created and then leave the Muslim world alone. No more arming rebels. No more drone strikes. No more being Saudi Arabia's arms dealer. No more buying their oil.

And no more immigration from these countries until vetting can be assured.
First and foremost, we need COMPRENSIVE KNIVE REFORM!
America is not the problem.

Radical Islam is the problem.


Naw, we need a restriction on trucks. Like just a 10 day waiting period to use your truck after you buy it. 
Trump backed her into a corner when he dared her to say it at the debate. 
The problem is a murderous worldwide empire.
Radical, Islamic, Terra'. They won't say it, but it is true
Check yourself shitlord. Did CNN give you permission to post this?
Can you be more bigoted? We just need to ban trucks, guns, knives and cars! /s
THe more you learn about islam the more dark it gets
It's all Muslims. To be a muslim you have to follow the word of Mohammed. The islamc books are instruction guides on taking over place, who to kill, who to enslave, how to kill and treat slaves, how to lie. Its not a collection of stories like the bible. People who follow the word of Mohammed want you DEAD. 
****GASP****
**WRONG**

The problem isn't Radical Islamic Terrorism

The problem is **Islamist theocratic fascism**
--

The ideology.

Even when it is peaceful.

**IF THEY WANT SHARIA THEY ARE THE ENEMY**
--

SECULAR MUSLIMS ARE OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES AND THEY REJECT SHARIA
SHHHH. Dont say that shit. Obama is watching...
Here in sunny California, politicans trying to vote in Knife control and Car control. Guess we taking da bus to work and eating with a spork.
I move that this description be amended from now on.

Radical Islamic Terrorism is a behavior.

The behavior doesn't exist without the fucking people to carry it out. The PROBLEM is **RADICAL MUSLIMS.**
#That's where you're wrong, kiddo.

Muslims are the problem.
Wrong. The problem is meddling in other countries affairs. The's countries need dictatorship to keep them in line. We need to stop attempting to set them up with so-called "democracy"

Whoa whoa whoa. Sounds like you've had a little too much to think. -Courtesy of Reddit Thought Police
Listen to "What do Jihadists Really Want" by Sam Harris. Literally ISIS itself telling the world that they do what they do because of Islam. 
I have read the quran.. believe me its crazy different from violence recorded in the bible. 
The problem is islamic dogma.. there is infact nothing like radical islamic terrorism. . It is islamic terrorism. . Sad but true.

Most Muslims like a lot of Christians just choose to ignore portions they find difficult. 

This is why exmuslims are very vocal about warning non muslims abot the quran...
Cars too! That fucker used a car to attack people. 
I think the stark contrast here is that, for US citizens, Islam is just a religion. But in other parts of the world it is a culture and way of life. 
The problem isn't Trucks. The problem isn't Guns. The problem isn't Knives. The problem is ISLAM.

**Fixed that for you.**

See how easily Trump shifted the narrative? After he said the election was rigged and he would have won by a million votes, you got Politifact and 20 other news sites calling him out by saying the ELECTION WAS NOT RIGGED!

He just completely had the media destroy any credibility the recount had by acting like he is stupid. Now every news site is indirectly saying he won fair and square by trying to call him out.

Also it will help push for voter Id reform! OMG this guy is good.
Trump won the election **AGAIN**!!
#**RELIGION OF PIECE(S) STRIKES AGAIN**
Alright, do we seriously need cars? They seem to cause more harm than good. I don't care if you're a "collector" or you use it for "transport". Imagine how many deaths could be prevented if we just ban cars. When our forefathers (and mothers) were alive, they didn't know that eventually we would have these massive 9 million horsepower automated assault cars. ALl they had were horses! Ban cars!
Was awesome having you, /u/TrumpSRB!
We have the best late night crew, don't we folks?
Unrelated to Trump but can y'all pray for the people in Gatlinburg? The fires are out of control and in apartments and hotels now. We love you TN Centipedes! 
Trump is calling Hillary "Crooked Hillary" again, truce is over, ready all battle stations, the great meme war of 2016 continues!
Who else wants an official USA 45 hat?
In the past week Libs have defended a commie dictator and are now defending terrorism 
Did Jill Stein just pull off this recount stunt to take heat off pizzagate?
Has Trump done any more videos, speeches or inverviews lately?
anyone planning on attending the inauguration?  Anyone trying to get tickets to the balcony from their Rep?
**I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS THREAD FOR HOURS**

I have to tell you guys about the dream I had on Sept 30 this year. Why? Because I forgot all about this dream until I came across its description that I had typed out on my phone. Do I normally write down my dreams? Never. But I wrote this one down and then forgot about it. Then I came upon it today. Here it is:

*I was in a room with a white board, an unknown woman and Bobama. The woman was making strikes on the white board like you do when you're taking count of something. I held back and bobama offered for me to make my strike ahead of him. I shook my head "no" and he looked at me and said watch this. He went to the white board and made his strike for Trump. Looks at me and says a lot of people are ready for real hope and change. I cry, he hugs me.*

I wake up. WTF? 
There's my **LATE NIGHT CREW!!!** <3 <3 <3

I saw Jeb Bush at a grocery store in Florida yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù

I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen cans of soup in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the cans and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each can and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

PigEar,Pa. checkin' in.....no recounts here!

salute!
still not tired of the salt from r/redact
I predict the big announcement today will be pizzagate and Hillary prosecution related.  Basically the recount effort showed that they didn't want to wait quietly until inauguration.  Hence Trump must play his hand publicly to ensure that any alternative other than him being inaugurated should be interpreted as a cover up of evil.

Quick question about this Recount stuff, should we be worried about it or am i over thinking?
Good luck to you brother. 
Why is everyone posting that Trump has won the Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan recounts? They haven't even began them yet? Is it a meme or some shit, or just misinformation?

Please help, thanks.
http://www.weau.com/content/news/Wisconsin-recount-effort-to-cost-35-million--403492956.html

This is some bullshit. Stein is wasting Wisconsin taxpayer dollars on this recount. 
I haven't been able to get a straight answer from anyone;  Is the Pennsylvania recount dead and buried?  Or is there still a way for them to get it done, no matter how far fetched?

Remember, Trump won because the entire world underestimated him and his message.  Now we have to make sure we stay grounded and don't underestimate the other side......

This is why I don't like Romney as SoS. The media is absolutely obsessed with the idea.
You can't take the "mad" out of the MADMAN.
Never seen a man move mountains with 120 characters...until Trump.
They should take a lesson from [George Costanza](https://youtu.be/9fnmiiJG0RE).
When in doubt, do the opposite of what anti-Trumpers say. 
I bought a few compendiums of Dilbert when I was a teen. I didn't exactly understand why I enjoyed it. It was about a guy with a shitty office job. The older I got the more I understood that it was about a guy recognizing the absurdity of life. I've got to dig those books out and read them again. 
If he didn't tweet they'd have virtually no access to him
Holy shit. Trump came into my room to bring me a plate of spicy wins and I literally screamed at him and hit the plate of wins out of his giant hands. He started making America great again and I slammed the door on him. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to not my president but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he still winning? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want a cuck to be president and fix my safe space. I cannot fucking deal with this much winning right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was polling well in Texas???? This is so fucked.
Not only have they been wrong about everything, but they don't even fucking report the news. One of my biggest gripes with political news in the current year is that all they do is talk strategy, rumor, and opinion.

Never stop offending them and triggering them. In fact, escalate it. That's the only way they're going to grow thick skin and stop being whiny little babies. The first step of beating liberals is refusing to play their game. When they throw their buzzwords at you, just ignore them and treat them like children. Don't defend yourself against baseless accusations because that just validates them. 

I've played a lot of online games in my life and I've been called worse things by 12 year olds than these so-called "triggers". These people are so pathetic.

Where are all these death threats and racial slurs?
Find out who their advertisers are, and email them about Gizmodo's behavior, making sure to let them know you will boycott them until they stop doing business with such a divisive and insulting company. The more emails they get, the more likely we are to succeed. GamerGate managed to cost Gawker at least a million bucks by getting their ad revenue cut via emails. It is possible.
I've been watching other threads complaining about us, and basically they keep saying the same shit over and over again.  We're intolerant because we delete pro-Hillary comments/threads.  "Rule VI: No Dissenters/SJWs, this is a pro-Trump subreddit"  Apparently the left can't read the rules of our domreddit.  Its not like we hid the rules, they're exactly where they are in every other subreddit.  Our description pretty much details that we're just super pro-Trump shitposters.  If you're looking for discourse this is definitely not the right place.  Go to /r/AskThe_Donald for that.

Don't worry, Mitt is not getting anything. Trump just like to keep busting his balls and rubbing it in his face.
The left are the ones that are afraid to criticise their own. That's what cuckery is at its core. You shouldn't be afraid to criticise Trump, otherwise you are following with the same blind faith as the left does.
I trust Trump with making the right decisions.

I also trust Trump with correcting his decisions if necessary, preferably just after saying "You're Fired".
I feel like nominating Romney will be more detrimental to Romney than Trump. Romney has a lot of anti-trump sound bites and came off as a very sore loser. Romney tried to weigh in on the nomination process while hold no real position in the GOP other than a former candidate and he ran a very negative campaign while not running himself. He has an image crisis on his hand that he needs to take steps to repair.
Doesn't mean we have to forget what an a-hole Romney is.
Trust Trump. I have confidence in him. We aren't in room with him during these discussions and don't know what he knows. 


If /r/the_donald could pick SoS, who would we pick?
yep, let trump be trump.
I think he is meeting with him to get his advice on cabinet picks. If Romney feels like he has a voice then he shuts up and will still feel powerful. It's all a game Trump is masterminding. Trump holds all the cards in the deck and Romney is the Joker.
I trust him
He has his reasons and I back the man to the hilt!
Agreed. Sad about the downvotes
# #NOTMYSOS 

I honestly can't fathom Trump hiring Romney. I see this all playing out with Trump saying that Romney will be one of his close advisors or something to that effect. 

But if he does make him SOS, oh well. What can we do? Move to Canada I guess? 
Not a chance. Betrayal of trust is a real thing. You want to be a mindless robot then more power to ya, but me and a lot of others will not show up to vote for him again in 4 years if he does this.
I still think he is going to ask him to hold the keys in the Blind Trust for the business. Two Prong move. Who could attack him for his business if is vocal opponent is running the show while he is in office? Non Disclosure Agreement he could never say anything.  
I agree with you /u/iheartseverus.  

In all honesty, if we put the personal stuff aside, Romney would actually be a pretty damn good pick (though I'd personally rather see Tulsi).  But Romney would probably be pretty solid.

And to everyone who still hates Romney, you'd get the joy of watching him eat crow for the next several years.  He'd have to live forever knowing that he owes any current relevance to Trump.
wouldn't mind seeing him get the SoVA. FNC keeps calling him a turn-around artist (for whatever that's worth).
Give Trump a chance. He's interviewing and reviewing. He has reasons for doing things.
Like it or not, Romney has power. Its his own power base. Trump isn't even in office yet. Same with some of our other favorites, like Schumer. He is going to have to GO INTO the swamp before it can be drained. In Washington, that generally means getting dirty. This next bit is where Trump can really style and shine, or...
I feel like these threads are catching a shit ton of shills who are using concern troll tactics to spread dissension in the ranks. 
How has AC been affected by a non-confirmed president? I mean he's a apparently a solid negotiator, but there's no direct involvement on his behalf. There are other people in this country you know.

I tweeted back that "Clinton News Networks is FAKE NEWS"
I like that first reply in to that tweet about the person voting 7 times for Hillary when we only voted once for Trump. Where are the MSM and FBI when they admit to this? Oh yeah, we're the conspiracy nuts for suggesting people might commit voter fraud, my bad.
Am I the only one who laughs out loud and says "I fucking love this guy!" even though Im home alone?


I know what to do. Switch it off. 
I honestly don't care at this point if he gets a single policy passed.  Don't care if he follows through on anything.

This triggering of the left is stand alone delicious.  I could subside on only that.

But winning is fun, and I'm certainly not tired of it.
"CNN is the most neutral cable news network" - Every Democrat/Liberal ever.

I recently participated in a recount in Michigan.  I know the process very well having just done so.  There are several things you all (especially Michigan centipedes) should know about recounts in Michigan:

- There is no requirement of even a scintilla of evidence of impropriety, and **the party demanding the recount can pick and choose which precincts to recount (eg. only precincts Hillary won) so unless Trump's campaign orders recounts in the conservative precincts he won, the recount will be 100% slanted toward Hillary Clinton.**  

- Recounts examine ONLY the ballots themselves and not whether anyone voted illegally.  All ballots are assumed valid.

- Stein is raising money not only to cover the cost of the recount, but to pay attorneys and staff to watch the recount on behalf of Hillary.  Those people will challenge any ballot they want that voted for Trump.  If Trump supporters do not similarly supervise the recount, they will probably skew the results towards Hillary.  Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 4,874 precincts: **just 2.2 votes per precinct.**

- The greatest danger is that tampering with the ballot containers will go unnoticed or unreported.  The ballot containers are all locked with a fancy-looking version of a zip tie with a serial number.  Before beginning a recount of a precinct, the container is inspected to ensure the seal is unbroken, but if it is broken, the precinct is deemed unrecountable and the original total becomes official.  But one must wonder if a determined group of election workers and clerk officials could forge document numbers and provide contraband seals--or simply break a seal, change the ballots, and not be called out when the recount is taking place.  **This is a real concern in far-left, union boss-controlled Wayne County (Detroit), also Genesee county (Flint) and possibly Saginaw county (Saginaw).**

- In the recount I was involved with, the recount took place in a county building where nobody except lawyers were permitted to bring in cell phones.  **It is up to you, centipedes, to find out the policy in advance, and bring cameras and lawyers, to ensure they cannot lie about the seals on ballot containers.**

- The recount I was involved with did nothing to determine that people watching the recount on behalf of the candidates were really with the candidates.  It was a simple matter in this case (the candidates were both in the room) but you should make certain with your county GOP and with the Trump campaign you are officially registered as a recount watcher for Trump--or else the Democrats might send their people to pose as watchers for Trump.

- In Michigan's 46th State House race in 2016, a recount narrowed John Reilly's victory by 31 votes to 15 votes in 36 precincts, or 0.44 votes found per precinct.While this is encouraging, this was an affluent Republican district where the clerks were all professionals.  The discrepancies were caused by stray marks on the ballots causing the machine to incorrectly (but programmatically correctly) deem valid ballots to have over-voted.  

- The filing fees are not remotely close to the actual cost to taxpayers.  The cost is $25 per precinct if the outcome was close in that precinct, and $125 if the race was not so close.  However every recount requires multiple paid staff who are paid hundreds of dollars per day, plus clerks' offices and county and state Boards of Canvassers.  These costs are paid for by taxpayers.

- The additional money Stein is raising is for lawyers to be present at all recount sites.  These are large rooms where ten teams count through ten precincts at a time.  The lawyers decide which ballots to challenge, and then at the end argue the case before the Board of Canvassers.  Competent attorneys are needed for this job.  In the recount I was involved with, there was a substitute ballot where the poll worker failed to provide the ID number for the ballot it was replacing, which should have invalidated the ballot.  The lawyer for the side that stood to benefit failed to articulate that "if the one thing we know about this ballot is that it was improperly submitted, we have a preponderance of evidence suggesting the ballot is invalid." The lawyer lost the vote.

- Trump supporters need to take this threat seriously, contact your county Republican Party, and make certain you are available to participate in the recount in your precinct.

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, MY VOTE MATTERED. HURRAH FOR TRUMP!

2) Forces the MSM to defend flag burning, making more people despise the media.

Canada picked a cuck at the worst possible time. 
Some cuck over in /r/Cuckanada basically said that he was happy that we had Trudeau negotiating for us because "He wouldn't let Trump shit all over us". I guess he doesn't understand that Trump wrote the book on the negotiation, literally. 
[Hey guys it Justin Trudeau \(known in canada as Hambre-Badass\) here to renegotiate NAFTA in person with Donald wish me luck.](https://i.sli.mg/v2YLAA.jpg)
Haha this is exactly why you want a selfish asshole negotiating on your behalf. The cucked countries are so screwed. I've never been more proud
Trudeau talks like deaf people talk. Weird.

He's right. Lmao. Yoga Instructor plus their new carbon tax plus Trump on Nafta? 

All your drilling, petroleum engineers and equipment co. are belong to us. 

Our fucking leaf brothers and sisters deserve better. 


This is gold! A must watch. " we need our own Trump"
On energy:

"Trump's plan is to triple that.  We are going into competition with the United States and they have no carbon tax.  He's going to reduce corporate tax to 15%.  We are at 34%.  We are screwed."

Love it.  Hopefully there's a domino effect when it comes to carbon tax and the Paris Agreement.

As a Canadian born (Alberta) US citizen (MAGA), this shellacking exactly what Canada needs to wake the fuck up. They elected a party that caters to the cry baby left which is waaaaaay worse than anything we have here in the states. 

Pede's, keep this in mind, there are true conservative Canadian patriots that desperately could use our help to be saved from the cuckery of the boy. Show no mercy and I beg you to continue to shitpost Trudeau as a side hobby. 

I lived there for 11 years as an adult. It's a beautiful place but I had to leave because of three reasons; 1. The CDN sheckel is worthless, 2. Taxation is outrageous (not to mention I had to pay US taxes on top of it - form 2555), 3. The Canadian government is soooo fucked up I couldn't stand it, still can't.

NPR called his tweets "trolling" this morning. I chuckled. Sine of them realize they are being used but still go along with it. 
> New York Times DEC. 7, 2005 - Senator Clinton, in Pander Mode
>     
> Hillary Clinton is co-sponsoring a bill to criminalize the burning of the American flag. Her supporters would characterize this as an attempt to find a middle way between those who believe that flag-burning is constitutionally protected free speech and those who want to ban it, even if it takes a constitutional amendment. Unfortunately, it looks to us more like a simple attempt to have it both ways.
>     
> Senator Clinton says she opposes a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag-burning. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that flag-burning was protected by the First Amendment. But her bill, which is sponsored by Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah, is clearly intended to put the issue back before the current, more conservative, Supreme Court in hopes of getting a turnaround.
>     
> It's hard to see this as anything but pandering -- there certainly isn't any urgent need to resolve the issue. Flag-burning hasn't been in fashion since college students used slide rules in math class and went to pay phones at the student union to call their friends. Even then, it was a rarity that certainly never put the nation's security in peril.
>     
> The bill attempts to equate flag-burning with cross-burning, which the Supreme Court, in a sensible and carefully considered 2003 decision, said could be prosecuted under certain circumstances as a violation of civil rights law. It's a ridiculous comparison. Burning a cross is a unique act because of its inextricable connection to the Ku Klux Klan and to anti-black violence and intimidation. A black American who wakes up to see a cross burning on the front lawn has every right to feel personally, and physically, threatened. Flag-burning has no such history. It has, in fact, no history of being directed against any target but the government.
>     
> Mrs. Clinton says her current position grew out of conversations with veterans groups in New York, and there's no question that many veterans -- and, indeed, most Americans -- feel deeply offended by the sight of protesters burning the flag. (These days, that sight mainly comes from videos of the Vietnam War era; the senator's staff did not have any immediate examples of actual New York flag-burnings in the recent past.) But the whole point of the First Amendment is to protect expressions of political opinion that a majority of Americans find disturbing or unacceptable. As a lawyer, the senator presumably already knows that.

Unfortunately, saying that the problem is radical Islamic terrorism is an understatement.  The true problem is Islam itself, which needs to undergo a reformation very quickly, as it is incompatible with civilized western society.
I have a solution for this.  Let's impose Sharia law in San Fransico.  I bet the "progressives" have a quick change of heart.
the problem isn't radical islam, islam is always radical, it's just the regular islam.

keep in mind: 

crucify and amputate non-muslims, Quran 8:12, 47:4

kill those who insult islam or mohammed, Quran 33:57

kill anyone who leaves islam, Quran 2:217, 4:89

behead non-muslims, Quran 8:12, 47:4

fight non-muslims, even if you don't want to, Quran 2:216

kill non-muslims for not converting to islam, Quran 9:29

extort non-muslims to keep islam strong, Quran 9:29
Islam is the problem and needs to be removed from earth
Period
Terrorism will never stop until Islam is reformed. Their book literally encourages the killing of infidels and disownership of polytheists even amongst family. The reason I believe that while most Islamists are not terrorists, encourage the attacks, is because there is never a call for reformation from Imans and leaders of Islam. 
ok we know the problem now we just need a solution. The only solution I can see is a blanket ban on muslim immigration. They've turned their own countries into bombed out warzones - don't let them do the same to the West
**The problem is Islam.**

It is radical by its very nature.
They play to the left.  Befriend us, act peaceful, say the radical ones are different and that there are peaceful ones.  Bullshit.  They are using our kindness to get a foothold into our way of life and once they get control its over...we slowly over time become the countries that throw gays off buildings and stone women.  It needs to stop....go back to those countries if Sharia law works so well.
It blows my mind that people can find the common denominator when it comes to math, but not when it comes to multiple Islamic terror attacks.
nonono. i read huffpo. the problem is definitely trucks.
# Say it loud, say it proud. 
The problem is also the globalist military industrial complex recklessly intervening in Muslim countries. It plays right into their worldview of Muslims vs. Infidels and throws infinite fuel on the fire.

We need to clean up the ISIS mess that Bush and Obama created and then leave the Muslim world alone. No more arming rebels. No more drone strikes. No more being Saudi Arabia's arms dealer. No more buying their oil.

And no more immigration from these countries until vetting can be assured.
First and foremost, we need COMPRENSIVE KNIVE REFORM!
America is not the problem.

Radical Islam is the problem.


Naw, we need a restriction on trucks. Like just a 10 day waiting period to use your truck after you buy it. 
Trump backed her into a corner when he dared her to say it at the debate. 
The problem is a murderous worldwide empire.
Radical, Islamic, Terra'. They won't say it, but it is true
Check yourself shitlord. Did CNN give you permission to post this?
Can you be more bigoted? We just need to ban trucks, guns, knives and cars! /s
THe more you learn about islam the more dark it gets
It's all Muslims. To be a muslim you have to follow the word of Mohammed. The islamc books are instruction guides on taking over place, who to kill, who to enslave, how to kill and treat slaves, how to lie. Its not a collection of stories like the bible. People who follow the word of Mohammed want you DEAD.

The problem isn't Radical Islamic Terrorism

Listen to "What do Jihadists Really Want" by Sam Harris. Literally ISIS itself telling the world that they do what they do because of Islam. 
I have read the quran.. believe me its crazy different from violence recorded in the bible. 
The problem is islamic dogma.. there is infact nothing like radical islamic terrorism. . It is islamic terrorism. . Sad but true.

Most Muslims like a lot of Christians just choose to ignore portions they find difficult. 

This is why exmuslims are very vocal about warning non muslims abot the quran...
Cars too! That fucker used a car to attack people. 
I think the stark contrast here is that, for US citizens, Islam is just a religion. But in other parts of the world it is a culture and way of life.

See how easily Trump shifted the narrative? After he said the election was rigged and he would have won by a million votes, you got Politifact and 20 other news sites calling him out by saying the ELECTION WAS NOT RIGGED!

He just completely had the media destroy any credibility the recount had by acting like he is stupid. Now every news site is indirectly saying he won fair and square by trying to call him out.

Also it will help push for voter Id reform! OMG this guy is good.

Do I normally write down my dreams? Never. But I wrote this one down and then forgot about it. Then I came upon it today. Here it is:

*I was in a room with a white board, an unknown woman and Bobama. The woman was making strikes on the white board like you do when you're taking count of something. I held back and bobama offered for me to make my strike ahead of him. I shook my head "no" and he looked at me and said watch this. He went to the white board and made his strike for Trump. Looks at me and says a lot of people are ready for real hope and change. I cry, he hugs me.*

I wake up. WTF?

So apparently there is a guy who is running a bot and copying all our posts to a subreddit called /the_donald_discuss for ETS. Looks like all they have on their mind is us winners.

We should encourage meme assistance to other anti-globalist subs like r/le_pen,  r/the_hofner,  etc so many elections too little time!!  We must remember one of our mottos UNDER BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE !!!!
I saw Jeb Bush at a grocery store in Florida yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn‚Äôt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù

I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen cans of soup in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the cans and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each can and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

still not tired of the salt from r/redact
I predict the big announcement today will be pizzagate and Hillary prosecution related.  Basically the recount effort showed that they didn't want to wait quietly until inauguration.  Hence Trump must play his hand publicly to ensure that any alternative other than him being inaugurated should be interpreted as a cover up of evil.

Good luck to you brother. 
Why is everyone posting that Trump has won the Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan recounts? They haven't even began them yet? Is it a meme or some shit, or just misinformation?

Please help, thanks.

This is some bullshit. Stein is wasting Wisconsin taxpayer dollars on this recount. 
I haven't been able to get a straight answer from anyone;  Is the Pennsylvania recount dead and buried?  Or is there still a way for them to get it done, no matter how far fetched?

Remember, Trump won because the entire world underestimated him and his message.  Now we have to make sure we stay grounded and don't underestimate the other side......

When in doubt, do the opposite of what anti-Trumpers say. 
I bought a few compendiums of Dilbert when I was a teen. I didn't exactly understand why I enjoyed it. It was about a guy with a shitty office job. The older I got the more I understood that it was about a guy recognizing the absurdity of life. I've got to dig those books out and read them again. 
If he didn't tweet they'd have virtually no access to him
Holy shit. Trump came into my room to bring me a plate of spicy wins and I literally screamed at him and hit the plate of wins out of his giant hands. He started making America great again and I slammed the door on him. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to not my president but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he still winning? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want a cuck to be president and fix my safe space. I cannot fucking deal with this much winning right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was polling well in Texas???? This is so fucked.
Not only have they been wrong about everything, but they don't even fucking report the news. One of my biggest gripes with political news in the current year is that all they do is talk strategy, rumor, and opinion.
#How can we distort your words if you send them directly to the people!?

Never stop offending them and triggering them. In fact, escalate it. That's the only way they're going to grow thick skin and stop being whiny little babies. The first step of beating liberals is refusing to play their game. When they throw their buzzwords at you, just ignore them and treat them like children. Don't defend yourself against baseless accusations because that just validates them. 

I've played a lot of online games in my life and I've been called worse things by 12 year olds than these so-called "triggers". These people are so pathetic.

Where are all these death threats and racial slurs?
Find out who their advertisers are, and email them about Gizmodo's behavior, making sure to let them know you will boycott them until they stop doing business with such a divisive and insulting company. The more emails they get, the more likely we are to succeed. GamerGate managed to cost Gawker at least a million bucks by getting their ad revenue cut via emails. It is possible.
I've been watching other threads complaining about us, and basically they keep saying the same shit over and over again.  We're intolerant because we delete pro-Hillary comments/threads.  "Rule VI: No Dissenters/SJWs, this is a pro-Trump subreddit"  Apparently the left can't read the rules of our domreddit.  Its not like we hid the rules, they're exactly where they are in every other subreddit.  Our description pretty much details that we're just super pro-Trump shitposters.  If you're looking for discourse this is definitely not the right place.  Go to /r/AskThe_Donald for that.
Couldn't care less. The_Donald will reassemble come what may.

Don't worry, Mitt is not getting anything. Trump just like to keep busting his balls and rubbing it in his face.
The left are the ones that are afraid to criticise their own. That's what cuckery is at its core. You shouldn't be afraid to criticise Trump, otherwise you are following with the same blind faith as the left does.
I trust Trump with making the right decisions.

I also trust Trump with correcting his decisions if necessary, preferably just after saying "You're Fired".
I feel like nominating Romney will be more detrimental to Romney than Trump. Romney has a lot of anti-trump sound bites and came off as a very sore loser. Romney tried to weigh in on the nomination process while hold no real position in the GOP other than a former candidate and he ran a very negative campaign while not running himself. He has an image crisis on his hand that he needs to take steps to repair.
Doesn't mean we have to forget what an a-hole Romney is.
Trust Trump. I have confidence in him. We aren't in room with him during these discussions and don't know what he knows. 


If /r/the_donald could pick SoS, who would we pick?
yep, let trump be trump.
I think he is meeting with him to get his advice on cabinet picks. If Romney feels like he has a voice then he shuts up and will still feel powerful. It's all a game Trump is masterminding. Trump holds all the cards in the deck and Romney is the Joker.
I trust him
He has his reasons and I back the man to the hilt!
Agreed. Sad about the downvotes
# #NOTMYSOS 

I honestly can't fathom Trump hiring Romney. I see this all playing out with Trump saying that Romney will be one of his close advisors or something to that effect. 

But if he does make him SOS, oh well. What can we do? Move to Canada I guess? 
Not a chance. Betrayal of trust is a real thing. You want to be a mindless robot then more power to ya, but me and a lot of others will not show up to vote for him again in 4 years if he does this.
I still think he is going to ask him to hold the keys in the Blind Trust for the business. Two Prong move. Who could attack him for his business if is vocal opponent is running the show while he is in office? Non Disclosure Agreement he could never say anything.  
I agree with you /u/iheartseverus.  

In all honesty, if we put the personal stuff aside, Romney would actually be a pretty damn good pick (though I'd personally rather see Tulsi).  But Romney would probably be pretty solid.

And to everyone who still hates Romney, you'd get the joy of watching him eat crow for the next several years.  He'd have to live forever knowing that he owes any current relevance to Trump.
wouldn't mind seeing him get the SoVA. FNC keeps calling him a turn-around artist (for whatever that's worth).
Give Trump a chance. He's interviewing and reviewing. He has reasons for doing things.
Like it or not, Romney has power. Its his own power base. Trump isn't even in office yet. Same with some of our other favorites, like Schumer. He is going to have to GO INTO the swamp before it can be drained. In Washington, that generally means getting dirty. This next bit is where Trump can really style and shine, or...
How has AC been affected by a non-confirmed president? I mean he's a apparently a solid negotiator, but there's no direct involvement on his behalf. There are other people in this country you know.
Remember folks, no refunds!

That's the face of someone who just got told he gets to be in trumps cabinet... As a coffee intern

He named him Secretary of the Trench. He is to be sent down into the Mariana Trench, in a submarine, where he will study sea life. His mission ends in February, of 2020. 
It's the pic of Trump!  He's got that winning like crazy oook!
Bored at work?
One answer.

Work harder. MAGA.
Lol sums me up, am at work and every five minutes am looking at r Donald new posts. Waiting for my frog child's to post rare pepes
Just go find a liberal and pimp slap em, should cheer you up. 
LMAO. Strip their press credentials. CNN = GARBAGE
His presidency is delivering so much more than my already high expectations.

Like, what do I even do right now?
Don lemon is visibly triggered on his show. Imagine when these are coming from @POTUS
CNN defends itself by claiming that they're just "doing their job." Yeah right.


Journalists are supposed to provide fair, balanced coverage of major issues and events using facts (and not just the convenient ones) as well as primary sources. Instead, CNN uses wild conjectures and outright lies to peddle a ridiculous narrative. Sad!  
Must be hard gambling all your dignity on a horse that lost.. and lost miserably. Let's see a WH that only infowars and breitbart have press credentials lol.

Did Trump just ask CNN for proof of a negative? 

I like this a lot. It means we can say whatever we want without burden of proof - they must prove that something doesn't exist instead of the other way around. We could have fun with this. 
But he went to dinner and didn't let CNN protect him!
I like that these news outlets are relegated to broadcasting and highlighting his tweets.

Shitposter-In-Chief! Best president EVER. I think the only president that could come close to Trump's glorious shit talking tweets is Jefferson or maybe Teddy Roosevelt.
Trump truly speaks for the everyday man. Everyone knows what TRASH CNN is. 
Crooked did this. She just had to crawl back. She couldn't just go away. And CNN encouraged her. CNN deserves the scorn, they earned it.

This is great. The more eccentric and "un-presidential" his tweets, the more powerless and irrelevant the press/left become.

They know *exactly* what to do: bitch and moan and play the victim... anything but real journalism.
Honestly, CNN doesn't need to do anything.  In fact, the less they do, the better the world will be. 
I tweeted back that "Clinton News Networks is FAKE NEWS"
I like that first reply in to that tweet about the person voting 7 times for Hillary when we only voted once for Trump. Where are the MSM and FBI when they admit to this? Oh yeah, we're the conspiracy nuts for suggesting people might commit voter fraud, my bad.
Am I the only one who laughs out loud and says "I fucking love this guy!" even though Im home alone?


I know what to do. Switch it off. 
I honestly don't care at this point if he gets a single policy passed.  Don't care if he follows through on anything.

This triggering of the left is stand alone delicious.  I could subside on only that.

But winning is fun, and I'm certainly not tired of it.
"CNN is the most neutral cable news network" - Every Democrat/Liberal ever.
Why are most of the comments on twitter from haters? Sad.
Does the president get to pick who is in the white house press room? Could he tell certain media outlets to get the f out and replace them? 
This may be the most savage one yet

I think people are misinterpreting Romneys goofy face to somehow say he's not getting SOS. Why would Trump go to dinner with him if it wasn't something important?

I recently participated in a recount in Michigan.  I know the process very well having just done so.  There are several things you all (especially Michigan centipedes) should know about recounts in Michigan:

- There is no requirement of even a scintilla of evidence of impropriety, and **the party demanding the recount can pick and choose which precincts to recount (eg. only precincts Hillary won) so unless Trump's campaign orders recounts in the conservative precincts he won, the recount will be 100% slanted toward Hillary Clinton.**  

- Recounts examine ONLY the ballots themselves and not whether anyone voted illegally.  All ballots are assumed valid.

- Stein is raising money not only to cover the cost of the recount, but to pay attorneys and staff to watch the recount on behalf of Hillary.  Those people will challenge any ballot they want that voted for Trump.  If Trump supporters do not similarly supervise the recount, they will probably skew the results towards Hillary.  Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 4,874 precincts: **just 2.2 votes per precinct.**

- The greatest danger is that tampering with the ballot containers will go unnoticed or unreported.  The ballot containers are all locked with a fancy-looking version of a zip tie with a serial number.  Before beginning a recount of a precinct, the container is inspected to ensure the seal is unbroken, but if it is broken, the precinct is deemed unrecountable and the original total becomes official.  But one must wonder if a determined group of election workers and clerk officials could forge document numbers and provide contraband seals--or simply break a seal, change the ballots, and not be called out when the recount is taking place.  **This is a real concern in far-left, union boss-controlled Wayne County (Detroit), also Genesee county (Flint) and possibly Saginaw county (Saginaw).**

- In the recount I was involved with, the recount took place in a county building where nobody except lawyers were permitted to bring in cell phones.  **It is up to you, centipedes, to find out the policy in advance, and bring cameras and lawyers, to ensure they cannot lie about the seals on ballot containers.**

- The recount I was involved with did nothing to determine that people watching the recount on behalf of the candidates were really with the candidates.  It was a simple matter in this case (the candidates were both in the room) but you should make certain with your county GOP and with the Trump campaign you are officially registered as a recount watcher for Trump--or else the Democrats might send their people to pose as watchers for Trump.

- In Michigan's 46th State House race in 2016, a recount narrowed John Reilly's victory by 31 votes to 15 votes in 36 precincts, or 0.44 votes found per precinct.While this is encouraging, this was an affluent Republican district where the clerks were all professionals.  The discrepancies were caused by stray marks on the ballots causing the machine to incorrectly (but programmatically correctly) deem valid ballots to have over-voted.  

- The filing fees are not remotely close to the actual cost to taxpayers.  The cost is $25 per precinct if the outcome was close in that precinct, and $125 if the race was not so close.  However every recount requires multiple paid staff who are paid hundreds of dollars per day, plus clerks' offices and county and state Boards of Canvassers.  These costs are paid for by taxpayers.

- The additional money Stein is raising is for lawyers to be present at all recount sites.  These are large rooms where ten teams count through ten precincts at a time.  The lawyers decide which ballots to challenge, and then at the end argue the case before the Board of Canvassers.  Competent attorneys are needed for this job.  In the recount I was involved with, there was a substitute ballot where the poll worker failed to provide the ID number for the ballot it was replacing, which should have invalidated the ballot.  The lawyer for the side that stood to benefit failed to articulate that "if the one thing we know about this ballot is that it was improperly submitted, we have a preponderance of evidence suggesting the ballot is invalid." The lawyer lost the vote.

- Trump supporters need to take this threat seriously, contact your county Republican Party, and make certain you are available to participate in the recount in your precinct.

FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, MY VOTE MATTERED. HURRAH FOR TRUMP!

This is gold! A must watch. " we need our own Trump"
On energy:

"Trump's plan is to triple that.  We are going into competition with the United States and they have no carbon tax.  He's going to reduce corporate tax to 15%.  We are at 34%.  We are screwed."

Love it.  Hopefully there's a domino effect when it comes to carbon tax and the Paris Agreement.

I lived there for 11 years as an adult. It's a beautiful place but I had to leave because of three reasons; 1. The CDN sheckel is worthless, 2.

NPR called his tweets "trolling" this morning. I chuckled. Sine of them realize they are being used but still go along with it. 
> New York Times DEC. 7, 2005 - Senator Clinton, in Pander Mode
>     
> Hillary Clinton is co-sponsoring a bill to criminalize the burning of the American flag. Her supporters would characterize this as an attempt to find a middle way between those who believe that flag-burning is constitutionally protected free speech and those who want to ban it, even if it takes a constitutional amendment. Unfortunately, it looks to us more like a simple attempt to have it both ways.
>     
> Senator Clinton says she opposes a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag-burning. In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that flag-burning was protected by the First Amendment. But her bill, which is sponsored by Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah, is clearly intended to put the issue back before the current, more conservative, Supreme Court in hopes of getting a turnaround.
>     
> It's hard to see this as anything but pandering -- there certainly isn't any urgent need to resolve the issue. Flag-burning hasn't been in fashion since college students used slide rules in math class and went to pay phones at the student union to call their friends. Even then, it was a rarity that certainly never put the nation's security in peril.
>     
> The bill attempts to equate flag-burning with cross-burning, which the Supreme Court, in a sensible and carefully considered 2003 decision, said could be prosecuted under certain circumstances as a violation of civil rights law. It's a ridiculous comparison. Burning a cross is a unique act because of its inextricable connection to the Ku Klux Klan and to anti-black violence and intimidation. A black American who wakes up to see a cross burning on the front lawn has every right to feel personally, and physically, threatened. Flag-burning has no such history. It has, in fact, no history of being directed against any target but the government.
>     
> Mrs. Clinton says her current position grew out of conversations with veterans groups in New York, and there's no question that many veterans -- and, indeed, most Americans -- feel deeply offended by the sight of protesters burning the flag. (These days, that sight mainly comes from videos of the Vietnam War era; the senator's staff did not have any immediate examples of actual New York flag-burnings in the recent past.) But the whole point of the First Amendment is to protect expressions of political opinion that a majority of Americans find disturbing or unacceptable. As a lawyer, the senator presumably already knows that.

Muslims are blowing stuff up, beheading journalists, shooting cartoonists, throwing gay people off buildings, and so forth? Yeah, but the Crusades! A lot of "refugees" are simply economic migrants looking for the sweetest deal in terms of social safety nets? Yeah, but YOUR ancestors were immigrants, too!

We're all here, now, in this current time and this current world. Justifying bad things and bad ideas today because people enacted similarly stupid things hundreds of years before any of us were born is retarded. Those past events might be superficially similar to the challenges we face today, but they aren't the same thing.
The left has forgotten that the president is here to protect the best interests of the American people, not the world. 
Sorry but I could not stand to have a friend like that. Completely unable to understand logic/facts, "do research" "look deeper", but then provides no specifics to research or facts. Then gets offended and feels unwelcome?! Hooooooly shit. Why can't they be the ones who get attacked with a machete so they can actually see what we mean?

Like a goddamn fiddle. 
ALL. DAY. LONG. I love my new life, looking for Trump tweets. 
Been in this boat a few times. Mods always sort out the Truth afterwards.


----

I actually support detaining until proof. I've been banned here at least 3 times due to properly playing the devils advocate too well! Not that it was all wrong thought. Just that I support critical thinking above all else!

On a further edit: I've discussed with multiple mods due to this and have a resounding faith in the mods we have. They get a shit ton of reports and act, the User can challenge it. I have yet to see a mod check my history of Pro-Trump love and validate the ban. I also understand I can be controversial and I still support this structure. Vetting of users should be extreme as we are not born citizens of T_D.



We have the best mods Folks!

Dopey Stein missed the deadline, now let the crying of SJWs who donated their money commence.

She deliberately "missed" the deadline so she doesn't have to pay for the damn recount. That way, she gets gets to keep the money. Dopey Stein!

How 'bout we do a recount of the states that Clinton stole. And then lock her up.
Did the recount get turned down?
I was so happy to see my state put Donald over 270. I am the independent, forgotten man that elected him.
Don't get my hopes up for no reason.  They are still doing a recount arent they...?
I joined this sub because you gents provided a lot of good info going into election night. 

But this ignorant 'WE HAVE ALREADY WON THE RECOUNTS' attitude is infuriating to me. Do you not realized that we are still dealing with the same corrupt people who stole the dem primary, cheated in the debates, has connections with child molesters, kills people, takes bribes and commits treason?

You don't think they're fully prepared to steal this election!???
You think they're going to lay down because of the members of this subreddit?

WAKE UP! The fight has just now began!!! Stop being arrogant. Get involved. Do not let this election be stolen by the democrat machine throwing away Trump ballots, getting crooked judges to approve illegal recounts etc...

This is the day to FIGHT. Not mock your opponents who you haven't vanquished yet!! We celebrate later, after the inauguration. Today we fight!!! And we don't stop fighting until the victory is truly OVER!
So much Yes
#NEVER SICK OF WINNING
I didn't realize how much I missed Trump's smug victory face plastered over states as they were called for him on election night until now. Thanks based plant lady for stealing millions of dollars so we could all win twice <3

She picked a state where she new a recount would not happen. Got everyone hyped so they would donate.

She is officially claiming she has no proof of fraud, but believes a recount can do so.  Except in PA, the law requires you to prove fraud in order to do a recount.

When I went to Cuba on a tour a year ago it was fascinating. I have been to 30+ countries (not including Europe) and Cubans by far wear the most amount of American flag decorated clothing. Way more than in America. 

Cubans would always ask us where we were from? My friends were from my England, Australia, Ireland, and Singapore. Whenever I would say America their eyes would always light up and I would get  special treatment. They have the American dream.
Man hillary cant catch a break
There are more interesting stories on this sub than anywhere else, right now.
As a Cuban-American, this is fantastic to read. Cubans simply aren't allowed to have a public dissident opinion, but inside, some of them are based as hell. Soon, Trump will cut a better deal for us and them. And it will be MAGAjestic. 
That face when Cuba goes from being one kind of red state to the other kind of red state.

This is what real tiger's blood is like, winning
We should give props to Bill Mitchell. His tweets are top notch!
If Trump is an idiot, what does that make the person who lost the election to him in a landslide?

A dumb, retarded, moronic, stupid, motherfucking dunce?

Just curious.
The media will call any president with an R after their name a derogatory name.  Any idiot with a D after their name is a genius.  Media coverage of Republican presidents over the last 64 years can be summed up in a nutshell:

Eisenhower was stupid, lazy, and incoherent.  
Nixon was evil.  
Ford was stupid and clumsy.  
Reagan was the "amiable dunce."  
Bush, a rich, out-of-touch rah-rah Ivy League cheerleader.  
George W. Bush ‚Äì dumb.  
Donald Trump - idiot. 
Not to speak for the God Emperor, but I expect he likes it that way. The more they underestimate him the more he wins. I don't know about you but I am not tired of winning...Praise KEK

How the fuck can your think he's an idiot after all this? People legitimately think we have Mr. Bean as our president just dumb lucking his way to success. For decades.

"I really know what it's like to be fat shamed, I mean, it's terrible..." - Ana

"Get the fuck off the stage, you fat fuck!" - Also Ana
long video but it makes me laugh hard from overly confident and cocky to complete meltdown 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO4xfj0ISoY

Ana, The Young Turks show is named after the [group that carried out the Arminian genocide]( http://www.armenian-genocide.org/young_turks.html) She is literally a lapdog for an Armenian genocide denier, she is not better than anyone.  
Kek, is that the Armenian chick who hosts a show called THE YOUNG TURKS alongside an Armenian genocide denier? üòÇ 
Bet her vag is a dry desert 
She is irrelevant ,  Here is a reality check back to her . We voted for Trump based on platform , Ideology , values . I find this wanna be bullies so funny . They insult our intelligence saying she has a vagina you most vote for her . At the end of the day Ana . We are forward thinkers , we are not involved in the stupidity of the women equality shit . Under the law we are equal ,  I never held a job and got paid less than a man . What is social justice ? To this people the perpetual wealth fare state . To keep the indoctrination to socialism. The ones that think abortions are birth control . Cause God forbids they have to be responsible for their own birth control . All or most they stand for is utter bullshit (par my french ) This woman is nothing but a product of a really bad education if she had any . Where she probably got to her position by sleeping around which is comical she is trying to claim moral superiority . I am glad to be a deplorable , A Trump supporter and a Woman that do not need or want to support socialism or the gov intrusion in my life . The biggest reason I voted for Trump is to protect the Republic from wackos like you girly . To make sure that the little girls in my family get to enjoy freedom and the Country I grew up in . Strong , respected , full of opportunities for those who work hard regardless of social status or gender . You can't be more equal than that . 
Look at that face!
So tolerant of diverse views. 
I have no idea who this woman is, but she's making the same face my 18 month old grandchild made this morning when I wouldn't give her a KitKat for breakfast.
don't forget she tried to fat shame Alex Jones (he's big boned)
Wut a nasty cunt
-be Armenian
-work for "THE YOUNG TURKS"

Enough said.
I remember seeing the TYT meltdown video when President Trump got elected. She was all like "If I see you're a woman that supports Trump I don't think you're different, I just think you're dumb", and "You're not failing at life because of affirmative action, you fail at life because you're a LOSER". Get BTFO you cunt.
she's apart of the "body positive movement" but went out and got plastic surgery.


Nothing against plastic surgery, people struggling with self esteem or body issues, but if you preach "body positivity" shut the fuck up if you get plastic surgery.


also she fat shamed Alex jones who was being dorky and playful. Totally non threatening, the Young Cucks can't take a joke, can't stand being the butt of a joke and are giant fucking hypocrites.


Also alex jones was assaulted by JIMMY BORE!


videos online if you google jimmy dore spitting on alex jones
#NASTY WOMAN

Just a negative hate-filled racist, when she isn't misandrist.  An Armenian who works under an Armenian holocaust denier whose disloyalty to America in his slavish loyalty to his ***ethnicity*** is self-evident in the title of the show.  She is the very thing she projects onto others, she is a classic self-hating liberal.
She's a walking, angry stick.
Kasparian sounds like an armenian name to me... the irony.
When the liberals send their shills, they aren't sending their best.


God I wish she would never talk again
And this is why regular, everyday woman who work hard. Play hard, and love deeply HATE this type.  She gives us all a serious case of rage.
It's always better to support a nominee who is propped up by countries who stone women, think that domestic violence against them is okay, raping them is okay, and have stripped them of all of their rights.  That's the ticket!
I tweet that to her every few days to remind her she is a hypocritical piece of shit. Cebu gets the meltdown video tweeted at him. 
**Leave our country. NOW!!!!**
2/10 would not smash
This is the nasty bitch who is a race traitor - being Armenian yet denying the genocide of her own people, isn't she?

She's also the foul bitch who was screaming at Alex Jones when that fuckwit on her show went completely apeshit on Alex.

You know what I think? I actually have a brain and I realised that I don't need to be lied to by 'politicians' about groupthink shit and told that I should be choosing a certain path on account of having a vagina. Thats why I'm a Trump supporter, bitch. And its fucking glorious to see you lose your shit because your queen bitch rightfully didn't win - because she's just as disgusting as you are.
Ana "New Nose" Kasparian.
#[SO MUCH SALT](http://i.imgur.com/ZRJLl8w.png)
No reason to give her attention, just another fucking nobody trying to be relevant by throwing a tantrum. 
This is an ugly person. 

The hate within is already affecting her physically. As the years go by, that hate will cause her body and soul to twist in grotesque ways. I think we've all seen people like this in their twilight years, bitter and angry and lonely. At least they'll have some cats.
Woman Trump supporter here, who the fuck is she and why am I looking at her nasty ass face?
She could be such a smart and attractive Trump common sense conservative, folks. Such wasted talent. Sad!
Watch your opsec OP, this one's a stalker
It would be a shame if people sent her very harsh messages. 
Poor nose job.  Poor, poor, nose job.
Annnd this is the difference between Reps and Dems.   Reps hate the Liberal ideals : socialism, nanny/welfare state etc.   Dems hate anyone who doesn'tagree with them.    SAD
Fuck this dude
DAT HERP DERP FACE THO
Her fish mouth is coming along nicely.
Ana, you've lost it. And you think I'm dumb? Bring it, sister. Transcripts, IQ test results, whatchagot?
I love it. It's basically the psychology of the participation award crowd. They cannot handle losing or being proven wrong.
I feel sad watching what Ana Kasparian and Young Turks has become.
I didn't have an opinion on the YT before I saw the post election meltdown, this chick is an absolute megabitch. Someone post her real nose.
Back where I'm from all my Armenian friends consider her a piece of shit for working with a Turk on a show called The Young Turks. It's kind of hard to put differences aside with a group responsible for genocide of your people and then have that nation actively deny it ever happened. 
she needs to find one of those straight white males who don't run in her circles! She'll be like "feels good man"
who cares what this irrelevant fivehead thinks or spews?
YUUUUUUUUGE nasty woman! Sad.
Just get laid already Ana! Maybe you might stop being a Marxist.
Hey!  I remember screenshotting this and posting this soon after the election.  

Not mad, reminiscing about shitposting at 6am on no sleep.
the desperate, self-loathing look of a woman that has hit the wall; she is past her prime and knows- on an instinctual level- that she will never look as good as she did 5 years ago, no matter how much plastic surgery she gets.
Honestly, I thought this was the picture of a female gymnast, as I am not familiar with her. Similar hair-bun style with similar makeup look.

Cuck Ogre and this nasty counterpart got rekt on election day.
  
Her career is over.  

Sorry. 
   
Her prospects for a possible future career are over.  
She is a foul piece of shit. As a guy I really cringed hearing her words and wondered what women felt, bet it was a real turn off from associating with people like her.
Her meltdown on-set with Cenk was glorious.  There are quite a few moments while he is staring at her mid-diatribe that you can see his body language shift and crack to something like "oh my god am I really as nutty as this fucking woman is sounding right now?"
I never even heard of her till November 9th, so I'm going to go ahead and go back to forgetting she exists. She's nothing in my life. ... Well, she HAS provided some comic relief, watching her angst over the election. That's been fun, I admit.
Ana Kasparian's hypocrisy in a nutshell:
*Condemns fat shaming*

Cunt. She even lied saying she openly heard people say racist things in that episode. You can tell. 
She slicks 'er hair back as tight as she'll go, boys, like a DIY facelift. *Greeeeeeaaaassy*
I'll be completely honest with you.  I've never even heard of this deplorable  bitch.

"When they go low we go high"
the moment Kasparian showed her true colors in all their dreary "glory"

good riddance to her credibility and career for this. 
TURKS??? 

can someone grab her by the P**** and throw her  outside the wall ?
Watched some election night compilation and **IT WAS GLORIOUS!**
She needs her Armenian anus stretched good, I volunteer.
This is the face of cognitive dissonance.  
Can anyone link to the video where she said this?
WTF that puta is married???!!1???1!!
Huh? What's the young Turks? Must be a fake news network. Also it's sad that they probably aren't reporting the crazy mess the *real* Turkish people are in right now
I almost feel sorry for Ana, the demons she fights so hard always get her in the end. 
She's such a composed and respectable young lady. Very good role model!
Is it "The Young Turks" or "The Young Cucks"? ;)
The fuck is "The Young Turks?"
The left has the best pieces of shit, don't they folks?
Miserable lady. 
Type of bitch that wants to peg all her men. 
I think she's part of Hillary's new organization. It's called, Concede Under No Terms. They really need to shorten that. 
Is that what she says she takes Ottoman dick out of her mouth? We don't care about PEOPLE WHO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH GENOCIDAL FREAKS
Armenian that works for Turks, it's no wonder she's self hating, she'd probably get thrown out of yerevan for telling genocide victims to check their Christian privilege
Oh another hypocritical liberal, what a shocker.

You really see their true colors when they lose. They really think they are better than everyone else. its sad.
With the amount of lies this bitch tells its no wonder she had to get a nose job
That episode showed how classy Ana Kasparian is
yfw you realize sjws are irl tryhards
I wonder if this cunt knows half the country thinks she is a worthless piece of shit.  She must prepare her own food 100% of the time.
It's almost like pretending you're better than the vast majority of Americans is the stupidest fuckin' thing you could do to 'help' your cause. It's almost like insulting people drives them *away* from your movement. It's almost like your entire movement is predicated on the Original Sin bullshit that if we aren't blue-haired dickless SJWs then we're racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, etc. and people didn't exactly resonate with a message of hate, exclusion, and shaming.
That thing just couldn't keep it together. Decomposed live on camera.
Just in case anyone wonders if she actually said it. She fucking did.
She's also an armenian who denies the armenian genocide and works for an organization called "the young turks".

let that sink in for a while.
[She also claims George Soros is pledging money to FIGHT hate crime. LOL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb5EOG356_o)
Go easy on her, will ya? She's a "journalist"!

They are literally shilling for Soros in one video. "He's just demonized'.
**TOLLERANCE**
Honestly, I have never even heard of this person before. 
SHE'S A WHITE MALE
#ANA 'NEW NOSE' KASPARIAN
**At the end of the day, what is more important- feelings or actions?**
Imagine being married to that cunt. Her cuck husband must feel like a prisoner
After seeing the debate between Cenk and the sexy Sam Harris, I can never take anything from TYT seriously and that includes this crazy feminist.
what a mean woman, not nice!
That was a wonderful meltdown to watch.
Her face gave me aids.
Can we get a video clip?  I'm going to need that for the future.
Garbage people on what I can only assume is a garbage show. Never actually watched it. It lacks any form of reputation.
"My people were massacred, and I work on a shitty program named after the people responsible for it. I'm the definition of an intellectual cuck."
She is Armenian, and the host of her show is an Armenian genocide-denying Turkish nationalist. She is not allowed to talk about the Armenian genocide on the show. On Armenian genocide Remembrance Day, she had to make a video about it on her own time because she couldn't do it on the show, while Cenk totally ignored it. 

Oh, the lulz. The absolute lulz. 
I don't even know who this woman is. Shows how important she is in my circle of things I do.
The Young Cucks
Guaranteed she never has children. Probably has a rescue dog that she treats as a child and says "Mommy's home!" when she gets back to the LA apartment.
She looks like one of those small yelpy dogs.
She is an embarrassment to Women. Put all the SJW Fem Bots on an island with their leader Hilldawg. Guaranteed in a week they will kill each other.
The scientific term for this is "Rancidus  Cuntus"..  It is the stage of mental decay that occurs just before a democrat leftist's head explodes.
I find it hilariously ironic how obese women with green/blue hair who are "sex positive" (AKA: Lie to their boy toys about being non-monogamous and sneak around) who say "the white race is going to be dead in 50 years" with a shit eating grin on their face are calling people who simply want to uphold the american values and culture our country was founded on "deplorable" and "intolerant". 
Given the love of projection by most liberals,  this becomes very sad when you realize she's really talking about herself. 

My greatest fear is that my daughter grows up like this, full of such self hatred,  surrounded by terrible people. 
Pretty sad.

Being on the Young Turks basically means your a far left and your opinion shouldn't be valued 
Disgusting trash. 
I have never even heard of Ana Kasparian.  She must believe she is far more relevant than she actually is.
She's wearing a enough makeup to paint a canvas with and still barely manages to get to a 5/10. 
Holy shit all that love and tolerance is exhausting
Middle America doesn't know or care about her. 
Their behavior is so comically ridiculous that sometimes I wonder if this is all a scripted show they're pulling off. Are we the ones being trolled or is this real life?
Her tears taste so good 
It's hard to hate her too much with the knowledge that seriously nobody cares even a little bit about what she thinks.
53% of women obviously dont know what majority of women need.. i wouldnt mind if my gf slept with trump.
I think Ana Kasparian is actually a man. 

She has a little bit of an Adam's apple going on there.
That night could only have been better if they dump pig blood on the host at the end.
Lack of professionalism and logic!
Fuck this nasty slut. 5th rate at best.
nasty and ugly. inside and out.
I thought this was that one dude that Jimmy Kimmel is married to.
Her core is black rotting goo.
Silly OP, haven't you heard that Trump is the one who is divisive and offensive?
This woman sickened me. I was getting really enraged that she had the nerve to say that and immediately berate women like that. 
Strange how we're the tolerant ones.

Did somebody let her know the Armenian Genocide was real?
So equal.
Hey this is from Sargons vid :)
How is this dumb bitch still getting views? How did she get a job in the first place? As whiny as Megyn Kelly is, at least she had a brain to start with.

Lol look at all that impotent rage
It's a shame she's such a cunt, because boy is she hot. 
10/10 Would hate bang
20 years cutting timber in Alaska will take all the fight out of her. Load em up!
Another childless unmarried angry postwall cunt who no man of value wants. It should be no surprise she acts like this. Happy women don't act like this.
WOLF-CRAP!!!
Suicide watch 
The historic young Turks would be so ashamed of the modern ones. 
I feel like she's so uptight because she cant get the taste of Cenk's dick out of her mouth.
I would still smash the shit out of her. The dirtiest lie I have made this year is to say I was a HRC supporter, just to smash this one super liberal chick.
Ana "new nose" kasparian
Armenian Trump supporters shouldn't forget either.
Those tears were delicious, weren't they folks?
Well, I vote with my brain not what is between my legs you ugly hussy. 
People like her are the reason for the word 'cunt'
What is an Armenian doing hanging out with a Turk that still denies the Armenian genocide? THAT is dumb.
We *could* give her the Ghostbuster treatment...
I'd still hit that, but she'd be wearin' a ball gag.
Haha, love it!

Oh look, more pol trolls that for some reason want Trump to burn DC to the ground rather than make intelligent decisions.  Extremely qualified, diversity, builds political capitol, not a key policy making department.  Sorry guys, Alex Jones, Cernovich and Milo aren't getting cabinet positions.

Is it bad that I dont even want a stone wall but would be happy with a steel bar wall tipped with razor wire and possibly electrified? If not electrified just double it up with a road between it for patrolls?
**America** is the only safe space I believe in.
I remember early on thinking the wall was ridiculous, because of other means to get in i.e. tunnels.  Then I see the Don, on news talking about tunnel detection technology. Sure enough, I google it, and it is actually legit. How dare I doubt, truly earned my vote. MAGA

Oh for crying out loud!
The wall will never happen.
Roger stone has said last week  there are multiple copies of the 650k emails that went to congress and others. Word is the NYPD was pissed with the handling and knew they would fuck them and destroy evidence (FBI). 
I'm thinking the FBI is going to need approximately 52 more days to sort through the rest of it before turning it over to the State Department. They should take their time and be thorough. Surely the State Department officials will understand. What's that? Trump will be in office then with a new State Department and DOJ? Oh man, that is some unfortunate timing for Clinton and her pal Huma...

It's all about slowing Trump's momentum and constantly questioning election results and his legitimacy. Don't expect the constant roadblocks to stop until he's out of office in 2024.
We have won a lot more than the election twice. We won our country back.
Two elections for the price of one. Under budget and ahead of schedule.

Seriously. When he said we would just win and win and win he wasn't kidding. We're so not tired of winning we won the same election TWICE (and Hillary lost it twice, which is also nice, she deserves that mark in history).
We truly are in the dankest timeline. 
#FUCK YEAH BITCH 
We won the Whitehouse, senate, house, governors and state legislatures..... get rekt cucks
I still can't believe that they would give $7 Million to do a recount. Here we are, sitting there trying to get money out of Politics, and these idiots keep throwing their money at Politics.

Do you know what I could do with $7 Million? I would pay off my parents debt for them, buy myself a car & put a couple thousand in the bank to help me pay for gas & bills for the next few months while I find a stable job, and then give the rest away to charity.

These people are the worst.

Excuse me for not being up to date, but did they end up recounting it? 
I mean I don't want to count unhatched ornithes, but is it too early to call #3 in 2020?!
I'd have said "Listen Dems, if you help me achieve x(100 days goal), I will fund your recount.  And I've had said it on twitter.  
The kekmobile has arrived, and I am your faithful driver, the humble Pepe.
Now you need to win it a third time, because they're going to be putting a *lot* of pressure on the electoral college.
they actually did a recount?
How come they didnt give a shit when the DNC rigged the primary against Bernie, but when Trump wins they go batshit crazy..
I wonder how long til we see "kek" trending on twitter, Google, yahoo, etc.
what's better than winning the Presidential election? 

Winning it twice! 
We literally memed our holy warrior into the highest leadership of the land.
it was a [TRUMPSLIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5fgplp/warning_trumpslide_area/)
I just wish Hillary supporters would shut the fuck up for a few minutes to actually look at the situation from a non-partisan standpoint.

We were all mocked for saying the election was rigged. We were told not to whine about it if we lost. We were told that it couldn't be rigged. We pointed out how much it could be rigged in Hillary's favor, but we were always shut down.

Now this is going on, **only** in Trump states, and people are acting like Russia hacked the voting machines -- are you  Hillary supporters even serious right now? You have to be trolling, right?
So sorry, as I've missed you

So if he wins the election 4 years from now that makes it 3 elections won.

Does he get to serve for 12 years?
Still time for the 3 peat
Does this mean he 100% won for sure?
Against the all mighty democrat machine. 
Slightly unrelated. What does kek and btfo mean?
Crap this is funny. Did they do a recount or something?
Can someone link me the confirmation about the recount? I can't find anything official about it on google.
# [DJ Khaled said it best, President Trump needs to come out to speak to this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGXzlRoNtHU)
Then we wait until 2020, he'll win the electoral vote again, a recount will be called by the opposition, and he'll win after the recount concludes. 

**4 WINS!**

I don't think it's possible to win this election any more than Trump has...

Incredible that he managed to win an election twice that he only needed to win once...

Lol Trump is an idiot for saying the election was rigged. 

Wtf Bernie literally was totally in a rigged race.
Also Hillary might pull some shit on the 19/20th. She's threatening the electors.
At this point why don't we just have a third one?

Not that I think any recount will flip the election (if anything, I think it would give more votes to third parties - maybe even giving them 5%), but have any of the states even performed a recount yet?


And recounting isn't really winning twice. More like the victory is just confirmed more strongly. If we were doing a re-vote, then I think this picture would be more appropriate. 
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSS
Where can I go to find out accurately about the popular vote

So Jill stein bashes the fuck out of Hillary providing facts and everything and then wonders why she lost the election? AND TRIES TO REVERSE IT??? Wtf kind of dumbass are we dealing with here?

Has the recount happened yet?
Twice? Can someone tell me whats happening? 
This makes me happy. I want to go to sleep tonight knowing there are a bunch of pissed off SJWs and piece of shit anti-American redditors losing their minds. All is right. Now I'm excited to see the landslide victory in 2020 after he MAGAs for four years.

Hitler also won an election.
I could deal with a trump presidency if his worshippers weren't so rude. 
We still won once, sir/ma'am. We should also stop being so arrogant about it. 

Presidential elections are won every 4 years it is nothing new. Some have to stop annoying other that don't have the same views because it makes the rest of the population look arrogant and uneducated. 
A recount is the same election though. He won it once. It doesn't matter how many times you recount. They're the same votes. He could have won it a million times and it'd be the same with this logic.

They missed the deadline for "recount".  But the deadline to "contest" the result was today, and they made it.

The standard is they need a probable case that there was a major fuckup in the election in PA.  Obviously there is no evidence so they should fall well short of the standard.  But now it's up to a judge, and if you get a leftist judge ... who knows.

Hope I'm overestimating the issue, but PA hasn't gone away yet as far as I know.

Once again, how much money did the cucks waste on the recount donations?
PA is not over.

Here is the lawsuit filed today (28th) to "contest" the result.
http://billypenn.com/2016/11/28/jill-stein-files-lawsuit-to-recount-pennsylvania-votes/

This lawsuit has to show that the election is probably wrong if not rebutted.  That's a significant standard and it could well be rejected.

Simultaneously, Stein has filed for "recounts" in some counties where that is still possible.  This is also relevant even though there will be no statewide recount.

By reading pages 1 and 2 of the lawsuit itself one sees:
(1) The grounds are (a) the Halderman analysis, even though that says there's probably no error, and (b) anticipated problems found in the several county recounts.

(2) Even though they're at the end of the 20 day window for filing to "contest" and cannot meet the standard of proof that it should take, they are filing "protectively" anticipating they will be able to meet it once the several county recounts are complete.

Legal experts, please comment on whether it's possible to extend such a deadline with a "protective" filing like this.  I would think Trump should object to "holding in abeyance" the lawsuit until some other process, the several county recounts, are done.
She looks hotter here then in real life. 
...Pants Of Shit...
Post of the Day. I literally laughed out loud. MAKE MORE NOW. 
# EWW LAD
üòÇ The only way there could have been a recount is if Hillary's campaign personally coordinated for a recount immediately. Hillary couldn't do this after shaming Trump about excepting the election results at face value. It took a few days to grease Jill's palms and then it was too late.
She missed the voter initiated recount but she filed suit in Harrisburg. 

She had to find 3 voters in each district to file affidavits to initiate a recount. She was only able to file enough for 50 ot of 1600 districts in Philadelphia. She couldn't get 0.0089% of Clinton voters in Philadelphia to support her recount. Hopefully our courts shut her down too.

I am so jealous of this man
[Police Officer Horujko is a hero.](https://www.reddit.com/user/shouldneverhurttoask/)
I have absolute total respect for our citizens that place themselves in harms way risking everything - look hard at this picture you leftist college elite communists for here is a person that lives and breathes to make his community and country great !! MAGA

The hardest thing I have seen a leftist scumbag ever risk is a paper cut or a splinter from a sign saying how much they hate the true heroes and workers of America - please go and reevaluate your empty useless eater lives and consider contributing to the society you live in instead of trying to destroy it for Facebook likes.

For those celebrities that presumed to know better and chide us with a thousand ism's I also implore you to take a goddamn hard look at this person - here is a hero where you are a ZERO!

And they cried for gun control before the story even got out.

They want you disarmed. They don't care about 'safety', that's just an excuse to disarm you. If they care about saving lives how come none of them have proposed a border wall to stop the massive flow of drugs over the border? In West Virginia, you are **23.6x** more likely to die from an OD than be murdered with a gun.

Hey, Stein!  

Those *EEEEEEBIL* Russkies *definitely* hax0red our paper ballots.  

Yep!  They just plugged their laptop into the ballots (not the machines, the ballots *themselves*) one by one with a [super sekrit cable](https://i.sli.mg/3cDano.jpg) and they all got a little Hitler mustache at the top, the text turned to Cyrillic, and *all* the available votes switched to Trump.

I only know because I'm a privileged white guy and aren't *completely* illiterate like the rest of my backward, Rust Belt state filled with racist buffoons.

Oh, *do* come and mete out expensive justice!

Oh shit!!! Psycho Granny gonna bump up her donation meter and play dumb again...I tried to watch one of her videos but could not finish. 
But Michigan apparently is just going to do it which makes no sense. 
And she's leaving Michigan on the hook for 10 mill
I mean - Clinton joined her lawsuit now in WI so... someone is paying.
She's suing WI for the $3.5 Million tag they gave her. It's like as if she doesn't have the money or something.....
Keep us posted!
Pennsylvania? Michigan? Wisconsin?
Did she scam the democrats and expose that they were investigating ways to overturn since the election?
5:30?
My understanding is she filed but the deadline to pay up is this afternoon and she has not done so? Correct? 
All the effort will be in vain ? what a shame. We'd love to win again
It would be fucking funny if thousands of those donors did charge-backs on their credit cards so her fundraising account would be debited the disputed money and her campaign would be shit out of luck paying these fees.
She won't. She decided to keep the cash after blowing off Penn.

She just nabbed a ton of cash. Personally, I think The_Donald should start another one for a few other states (those whose deadlines have past with disclaimers of course). Lessie, 3 million should give us all a 10 dollar rebate...

She's great, but the Lady Gaga poster and Peace symbol are triggering me...
Obligatory, base statement on how attractive she is and how we have the best women. I agree with MAGAlanta, the peace symbol and Lady Gaga posters don't help her cause, but to each their own, as long as they believe in America first. 
I never understood that whole elastic band thing. Her sports bra looks like she's wearing men's underwear for a top.
She has a Broadway-Gothic Euro look that is deeply interesting to look at. She makes me think of musicals where everyone wears leather and sings heavy metal and wears stilettos. I like that.

Don't burn the flag because burning the flag makes you an asshole.  It represents too much to too many.  It's not a symbol of the government, it's a symbol of all the people.  It's legal to burn it, but if you do you're an asshole.
Love this post. The reactionary media is killing America. 


Not enough facts and too much sensationalism. This is a problem across the aisle. People live in both Liberal bubbles and Conservative bubbles. Diversify your news sources and read everything to find out whatever is really going on. 
My favorite questions I like to ask.

How long have we been a country?   A. 240 years.

If socialism and marxism is so damn great why haven't we changed before now?   A.....UUhhhh 
you dont have to be a citizen to be a legal resident of the USA, there are many many different non-citizen visas for long term and permanent residents of this country.

though, constitutionally you do have to be a citizen to vote.

You can request a flag that was flown over the capitol.

Check it out - its freakin cool https://www.aoc.gov/flags

Let's get this on /r/all. I want to see more attempts to justify protesting the flag. Irrational arguments remind me why we need to drain the swamp and MAGA! 
Why is this downvoted?  Leave if you don't like it here.
I'm not an American and I'll upwote your flag fellow centipedes üòé
Not an American, upvoted anyway.
You got that right, patriot! Let's do this!
I believe in the most American value of all, FREEDOM, so take my upvote from socialist EU
The vast majority of reddit is filled with pussified excuses of human being mellinial traitors with no real world experience. 
Or burn it.
those that downvote the american flag should spend a year in prison or have their citizenship revoked! 
You're right but they'll burn it instead.

Could it actually be coming to light?!?!
When I still had my Motorola RAZR flip phone back in the day (was a college student), I actually called Andrew Breitbart's mobile number.  (I was FB friends with him.)  It was regarding Meghan McCain's visit to my university...

Mr. Breitbart was a very polite and helpful character over the phone.  [I never met him in real life, so I cannot say from this point of view...]

Who really want's to practice religion like it's the 14th century? Knock the hell out of ISIS and do it fast. 
I continue to hold out hope that the youngest generations (32 and younger) of countries ruled by or sympathetic to Wahabism and Salafism will choose Capitalism over Islamism, equality over tribal custom, honorable deeds over honor killings, and open minded enjoyment of this amazing Earth over dogmatic servitude to backwards interpretations of ancient texts.
Although this is an excellent comment, I can't think of a single modern religion that had any period that was anything like what takes place in Islam. In fact, the worst crimes of Christianity were *ignoring* the fundamentals of Christianity, not clutching on to them.

The Reformation was actually caused  by a populist movement wanting the religion to be accessible by common people and following the fundamentals of what Christ taught, instead of an overbearing bureaucratic Church dictating rules that are found nowhere in the Bible.

The Church had become a political entity, instead of just a religious one, and that is what led to problems such as the Inquisition. Nowhere in Christ's teachings can a justification be found for forcing people by any means to be a Christian. The Church was simply afraid of losing its power. It was worldly concerns and nothing more than that.

Even the most oft cited example of Christianity's crimes, The Crusades, were at their heart a fight against Muslim invasion of Europe. They were far more political than theological. Just like when Kings stoked religious fervor to get their people to agree to war for conquest. 

And Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism ever being anything like Islam? Forget it.

Islam stands alone in this. Christians have committed evil acts by deviating from the fundamentals. Muslims commit evil acts by embracing their fundamentals. Any Reformation in Islam would have to actual involve editing their own scriptures.

None of the individuals in this picture is a Secret Service agent.  This picture is apparently from a period before he was given protection by the Secret Service.
Are they protecting Donald, or is he protecting them?
I can't wait to hear the stories from President Trumps Secret Service detail about how well he treats them in direct contrast to the horror stories told by Shillary's details.

‚ÄúA lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù he told Task & Purpose last week, at a swanky luncheon in New York, held on behalf of his upcoming film ‚ÄúPatriots Day.‚Äù We were talking about the parade of actors and musicians who lined up to denounce Donald Trump in the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.

‚ÄúYou know, it just goes to show you that people aren‚Äôt listening to that anyway,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThey might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don‚Äôt put food on their table. You don‚Äôt pay their bills. A lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble. They‚Äôre pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I‚Äôm very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it‚Äôs afforded me, I also understand what it‚Äôs like not to have all that.‚Äù

Sad. She could have kept her mouth shut and many of us would have thought she was just crazy, but at least honorable. Now even her own supporters are turning on her
Still only about 10 cents per citizen.
Using polls as a burden of proof for a recount.  She's nuts.
They just need to print out the Podesta emails where they plot to skew the poll numbers in order to "demoralize" potential Trump voters.
Polls that were apparently wrong everywhere were somehow "right" in PA?  WTF?
I thought Stein had missed the deadline for recount in PA?

I would so fucking love it if Trump went down there himself and spoke to the judge, ripping Jill and Hillary a new one. 
Why are they playing along? To make more money for their own legal team?

spez: It's tax payer funded, nevermind. First question still stands. 
Well, they hacked the DNC servers (they didn't, Seth Rich had access to their servers and copied the data and gave it to Wikileaks, then he was murdered for this.)
they have no proof so they use the fake and rigged polls as proof? brilliant. i hope this blows up in their face and donald camp counter sues crazy plant lady for trying to overthrow the election.
Mark my words, the Judge will throw the plant lady out of Court in short order.  Guaranteed.  She simply has not pled a prima facie case.  The Judge is just allowing for due process.
Anyone and everyone should volunteer for recounts. Bring your friends and family too. Bring video recorder pens and glasses. Document and record everything. We know how tricky and dishonest the left can be. Lets not take any chances!

Turns out the people that actually work these jobs to keep their kids fed with a roof over their head would prefer holding on, at least until Obama's new "wonder jobs" show up.

How do these people even sleep at night?  What is their mindset?
I imagine every single person in the current administration is busy shredding, deleting, bleaching, and trying to cover up everything they've been doing for the last 8 years before Trump and his team are given full access.
Because she's a piece of shit. Almost the worst of what humanity has to offer. 
Thank you, wonderful Amish friends!  MAGA!!!!!
Sadly they'll never see this!
I used to hate, just absolutely hate people like these.

I was an atheist who was so incredibly smug and superior. I was right, they were wrong and honestly the more religious you were the dumber I thought you were and the less I respected you.

I really do cringe thinking about how I was, even just 2 years ago. I'm still an atheist, personally, but I just have so much more respect for (good) people of faith. So much of my identity was tied up in that sense of smug superiority. Ironically, considering what the media says about DJT, his campaign has made me a far, far more tolerant and far far more open-minded person. Its really been a very strange 18 months for me.
But if I vote for Trump and you do as thine   
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699
"But all religions have terrorists!" -CUCKS
Support your local Amish by purchasing their goods which are most likely organic.
Reason #567 why this election was FUN AS FUCK:

We can literally thank the Amish for helping a world-class shitposter get elected president.

Why are more people not having so much fun right now? This is the best politics has been in my entire life. I do miss the insanity of the GOP primary though, when Trump was slaying cucks left and right.
Remember when that milk man raped and killed a bunch of Amish people? The Amish community contacted the murderer's wife and expressed their condolences for the suffering she must be going through arms they even shared with her the money that was donated to the families of the victims. 
Who is the Amish rebel in the lavender shirt and hoodie? I'm sure he sneaks off and reads /r/The_Donald. He's clearly a secret centipede. 

Amish girls aren't hot like I was expecting. Why do the Amish all have sneakers? I thought they'd have homemade leather shoes. I'm a bit disappointed. 
Thank you!

As far as addressing energy needs in this country I think the Amish are great examples of how to lower demand. That's the game: demand and how to reduce it. We could have renewable sources like solar and wind, if we were willing to unplug and read a book every once and while.

Re-read what your 9th grade lit/English teachers were trying to get you to read. "The Prince" is good, so is "The Jungle" (Sorry Gary Johnson, not a fan of eating rat shit passed off as wild rice).

My favorite is Gilgamesh, as it's the first known recorded story, and is about mortality, the ultimate struggle for some.

Don't be so defensive you are peacefull even tho you got wacky believes in my opinion. The book of Muhammed couldn't be a thing. :Y

Based Mormom, We Won!  America is going to be great again!
Those are very good words Thank You for sharing your views. I do have a question for you. This regards you knowledge of the Mormon religion I hope you don't mind.

I use to work in Wyoming and I had the chance to meet many from Idaho that were Mormon. I had a interesting conversation with this fellow explaining the faith. Do you know of a passage or a text stating the following.

If your neighbor asks you to take care of his/her mule while away for business due so. Be sure the mule is well cared for and in better health before your neighbor returns. 

Something like that anyway. Have you heard this? If so what is the history? if you know. 

Thanks. 
There are plenty of seats. Look around, find a comfortable one, and get ready for an enjoyable ride on the Trump Train!

Yes. 
 Need to get rid of the machines, go back to paper, counted at precinct, total posted in window same night, and with local paper like we use to do... only 500 people per precinct, like we use to do. That, is only ten decks of cards worth of counting for each issue/person. Machines are always subject to hack, no matter what, open source or not.. 

Now, I did think of a way to back any system up with mini exit poll vote "back up system" on "mini ballots" made of double raffle tickets. The tickets are glued to the board so they can't be removed. They are arranged in a way that is easy to count, and easy to snap a photo of at the end of the night. I created this simple cheap system originally to make the exit polls legally admissible in court. (notice exit poll people can sign the take home ticket as witnesses. I called it VEXIT, (cheap verified exit poll system)

The photo of the board of total votes can be stuck up on a web page with the voter getting the web address on the matching ticket to take home. 

Counting is easy... just multiply columns by rows. Everyone would be able to use their number to find their exit poll ticket on line in the photo.

 Nothing can be sold  to anyone, because it is only one photo taken post election. (each precinct would have its own web page for one each of these back up exit vote trifold boards) This board would be the only thing on the page. If something is not right with the count, a notice to show up at a time/place/proceeding can be put at the top of the page where the precinct photo is.

What ends up being cool about this, is, if everyone did the backup Exit poll, ballot stuffing would be stopped dead in it's tracks. Only people who actually appeared to vote in person could glue on a vote ticket for the exit poll. 

Here is the original photo of the VEXIT poll board and everything needed to assemble it. Here is a picture of what a finished board would look like. http://imgur.com/a/1LCI0
Like your purple finger idea too. 
Voter ID is excellent.
And why cant we have tear off tickets with matching numbers like these raffle tickets, and have every ballot photographed and put on its precinct web page in photo form?

What's scary about this is the left is making him out to be a martyr and making it look like we caused his anger. So the socialistic colleges will all probably start adding prayer rooms (at taxpayer expense and against separation of church & state) and move more towards sharia law on the college campus. Their way of life is creeping onto us.
He didn't come here to be part of America. He has no respect for the Constitution, or fellow citizens. Yet he was brought here by the executive branch (Obama and Hillary). They know these rapefugees are unvetted. They know some of them will slaughter innocent Americans.

#They won't let me pray to God so I'll kill people and ensure my spot in hell
Yep. My college just gave Muslim "refugees" (rich Egyptians) free tuition to make them "feel welcome" at school. 

All they have done since they arrived is harass the women, fight the men, remove pork from meal hall, ban prayer and country from campus radio for its "racist redneck culture", and whine about how much they hate the country.

The SJW societies act as enforcers against anybody who criticizes the situation by harassing/threatening them.

Needless to say I am transferring after Christmas. No more of my hard earned money is going towards this garbage.
No more tax payer funded tuition! 
Everyone on my Facebook (aka liberals) has completely gone silent. How fitting

We need to stop paying for this bullshit. Now. 
Keep your fucking religion to yourselves people. Don't push it on others. Fuck. How hard is that? I do my thing, pray when I want, when I can, at church, no church, driving, maybe quietly while sitting if I feel like it and then when I do, I don't bother anyone. I don't think my God cares where the fuck I am when I pray or at what time. God just cares that I call sometimes I'm sure. I'm sure God doesn't judge me at all. 

Religious fanaticals are stupid. No prayer room, fine go pray at home, no home? Pray as you walk, who cares if you have to touch a wall, be inside a church, on your knees, who cares, no one owes you anything. God doesn't care what you are wearing, where you do it, or at what time. No human owes you anything to go out of their way for your brainwashed rituals. 

Talking to God directly doesn't require money, a place or a time frame. Just do your thing and leave everyone else alone. 
Islam is a destructive force against civilization.  I agree with PresElect Trump's National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Flynn who believes Islam is a political ideology and it is enemy number one.  The OSU attacker is a great example of the threat we face.  

The Left, due to naivete or design, is complicit in advancing this threat against peaceful Americans.  I'm so thankful enough voters woke up and voted Trump - now we have to do everything to protect his Presidency and keep the Left out in 2018.

How does the left defend importing a skill-less patriarchal population of race supremicists where [98% of the women have their genitals mutilated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation#/media/File:FGM_prevalence_15%E2%80%9349_\(2016\).jpg) ?

Somalis in the US are some of the most anti-LGBT people you will ever meet too. They are constantly accused of tossing out Uber/Taxi passengers who are gay, sometimes even leaving them on the side of the highway.


[This is what Somali parents teach their kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfW9inRkTpU). The clip is a video of a bunch of kids shouting **"I HATE GAY PEOPLE"** at a guy leaving a Pride parade.
Can't wait until Trump is President. I have faith in him that he will deal with this shit & not hide like Obama.
Why am I paying for these third worlders education when our own citizens are living in poverty?
This is why you should get a CCW.

And pressure campuses to allow you the right of self defense against an attack.

As long as The Religion of Peace is here we'll have to deal with periodic outbreaks of "peace."
yeah because in the liberal fantasy land that is a university....you couldn't POSSIBLY reserve any number of rooms for muslim prayer.

im sure if he asked for it they would give him any damn room he wanted 5 times a day, every day...they would bend over backwards to give him what he wanted since hes a fucking BINGO on the liberal special rights list.
They are entitled, that's for sure. They have this "Order 66" coded  into them and whatever the trigger might be, a daughter dating a Christian or a lack of prayer mats; the violence is permitted and justified. Build the wall.
Theres a prayer room in the student union
I say kick the entire family back to Somalia.  If they are here that is.
America isn't here for the world to pick clean
And people want to call us crazy for wanting to Vette Muslim immigrants.
"BUT BUT YOU CANT WAGE WAR ON AN IDEALOGY!!!"


Trump "you said I couldn't do a lot things and now I'm the president. Step out the way"
He should have targeted Arabs, you know, the Muslims who generally regard Black Muslims as lesser trash

Or even Sunni or Shi'ite depending on which way the old goat tool was hanging. Fix your own peoples' problems before attacking America!
So the proper response is to run over people.  What a  shitty ass thug.  Make Ohio Great Again
When will liberals get it?

We owe these people nothing. Right now I would rather "lose promising potential" than let a single more American get hurt by a problem taxpayers are paying to import.
When will the cucks, liberals, Democrats, etc. come back to the table of America so we can start a bipartisan American coalition to counter the culture and violence of Islam in all the ways that make it incompatible with the U.S. Constitution and the American way of life?


This coalition of Democrats (if they want to survive) and Republicans should be implementing a total policy solution that includes many directives, including but not limited to:


* expose and refute Sharia Law in principle, and in practice oppose it in America
* oppose in principle and practice Islam's unacceptable treatment of non-believers, minorities, women, etc.
* encourage Muslim leadership that brings Islam to an interpretation compatible with modern civilization
* an intervention on immigration of certain populations that come from dangerous countries
* a contained but absolutely destructive operation to delete ISIS on all levels
I wonder if he supported Trump? (I don't)

Guess he'll just have to do with a bullet.
Pass a law banning prayer rooms.

Fuck these people.
Plenty of prayer rooms where he is now.
I hope Trump starts a program to forgive college debt to anyone who spends 25 years in Africa. 
The fact that his tuition was paid for most likely added to the reason he attacked others.

Psychologically,  

1. People value things they work hard for to obtain.  They also protect their investments.

2. People dismiss or value lower things that give them stuff where the cost is not visible.   They will subconsciously wonder if they will be made to do a service later (like in Godfather).   People distance themselves from things that will cost them in the future.  If they can't distance themselves, they may seek to destroy it.

Hmm being familiar with US campuses I bet you fucking money there were several facilities directly there for him to pray in as well as associations that are directly related to his garbage faith. Yup. 100%. Yet the media will print this shit. 
The worst part is that OSU actually DOES have muslim prayer rooms, FML.

I don't understand this waste of a fuck, you can literally pray anywhere in Islam (except bathrooms), and he wants to take his anger out on innocents, what the hell
I wonder if the steel table in the morgue faces Mecca?
I don't know if that image is real,  where he talked about transferring and how "the campus was so big, on my first day I didn't even know where to go pray,"  since his old campus had "prayer rooms" and the new one didn't.... but if it is real, jfc man.... Guess where you could have prayed safely.... LITERALLY ANYWHERE.  
  
  
  No one give a fuck if you put down a mat over on the quad somewhere and pray.  NO ONE.  Guess what's NOT safe to do wherever you please..... exactly.  Attack people with a knife.

this is a jihadi attack, exactly like Islamic State called for in Rumiyah magazine

make sure it is accurately reported as such. Demand media use the word "islamist" and put in his demand for a prayer room
Can't peacefully prey to my peaceful God.  I better go kill white people!!!
Shut down all prayer rooms.
I feel for his parents, that raised a little shit stain like that. On second thought his parents are likely to have the same mindset.

Fuck it, I used to be one of those cucks who thought all these terror attacks were just a few crazy fucks who happened to be muslim. But I no longer have any sympathy for these murderous assholes.

source? so i can share on FB? 
Build the wall in the south and north! No more immigrants for 20 years! Well, the ones on the list are fine. 
TRUst me. That's not why he attacked. 
Can we sue Somalia for a refund of his tuition expenses?  
  
Failure to pay results in forfeiture of all lands and property within the borders of Somalia.
"I'm sick of people thinking I'm a terrorist, I'm gonna go commit a terrorist attack"
Actually, if you read the news article that that was mentioned in, from the context it's pretty clear that he was talking about NOT KNOWING WHERE THE PRAYER ROOM(S) WERE because it was his FIRST DAY on campus.

That doesn't mean that there AREN'T any prayer rooms.  It would be surprising if there weren't.
College shouldn't be easy to get into or free.  
Somalia might make that list of known exporters of terror. 
Thanks, Kasich.

They had prayer rooms and even a Muslim society.  Links already forwarded to Breibart, Infowars and Daily Caller
This is truly deplorable, never should have happened
I got idea. Let's ban all cults so no one gets a prayer room!! Religion is the problem, always has been, always will be. When parents put that first the are raising a little cult member. This goes for every single religion. If people want to ban guns because a few people kill others with them, why can't we can religion because a few people kill people because of it? 


Sounds like we should get rid of prayer rooms and ban muslims from the country entirely.

We need to do something about left wing radical university administrations around the country.  Securing the borders will only fix a part of this problem.
Fucking scum. I work fucking hard to have a third of my paycheck given to pointless people like this. 
Most campus library have private study rooms... I'm sure no one would take issue with them being used for prayer. It's not the most sacred of places, but it would do in a pinch. That's the silly neo-pagan centipede in me talking (I'm sure more exist). I could revere nature in a cow pasture if I had to... and yes, I have before. And I'd do it again!
There's NO FUCKING REASON Obama has been giving out these free "Stay in America on our Dime" except to fucking ruin America and make it look like he's been keeping immigration low.

The more time goes by, the smarter Trump seems saying we should ban all Muslim immigration into our country. Yeah, I realize that not all Muslims are terrorists, but a significant portion are. Why let them in knowing this. I don't give two shits about some people in Syria or Iraq, I care about Americans. To hear that my tax dollars were being used to fund this peice of shit's college education infuriates me to no extent. I've worked my ass off since I was 16 (now 45) and I was never offered a free college education. My back is fucked up from doing manual labor for 29 years and I probably qualify for disability, but you know what, I can't afford to go to a doctor now with Obamacare to be diagnosed. Not that I would if I could. I'll keep working and pay my $1000 fine on my taxes because I'm a white male and the democrats insist that I pay for others to sit on their asses and not work (when they could) because they are minorities or immigrants. Fix this shit Trump, MAGA! 
Um, where is the source for this? Like, don't get me wrong, I'm pleased that the terrorist is dead. I was about to rage against entitlement with everyone else, but I like my rage with some basis in facts. 
Islam isn't a religion of peace, nor is it of violence. This was a violent guy who brought violence to the religion. I'm a Christian but I'll admit I was curious, after reading the Quran I must say, I have no fucking clue where this shithead is getting his cum-stained info (I never said I was a practicing Christian)

He's a bad person, but I know many Muslims who are on our side, as fed up as we are. I hate it when I see cunts on here slamming the door on their face
They all have to go back. The entitlements have to end. I don't give 20 minutes of every working hour to Uncle Sam so he can let jihadists prance about and hand out iPhones to drug dealers.

Shut it down. *SHUT IT DOWN!*
If this guy is getting his own prayer room then I want my own Kek room as well. I don't mean a single room for all religious people to pray in, just a single room devoted to Kek. I don't want those false idols to taint the sacred ground in which He indwells.
The thing is that even if had prayer rooms there would have been another excuse.

There is zero excuse for a person to drive their car into a group of people and then get out and starting to slash and stab others with a knife.  Just because you get angry at a situation doesn't excuse you to commit violence.  It's like telling a person who is being domestically abused that if only they did what the abuser wanted then the abuse would stop.  No, that isn't what happens.  The abuser just finds another reason to abuse their victim.  It doesn't stop...  Ever.

That is what needs to be explained.  The only way to stop the abuse is to make sure that the person causing the abuse can't do so again.  There is no rationalizing with them, there is no bargaining with them, and the longer you stay in that abusive relationship the worse it will get.

The truth is we are in an abusive relationship and it is time to put a stop to it.
We gotta stop appeasing this religion. Separation of church and state, if you dont like it tough titties. 


Yeah let's add additional locations for these assholes to radicalize. 
This bugs me a lot.   I have a friend on campus who is Muslim.   There's no official "prayer room" on campus, but when it's time for him to do his thing, he spots an empty room and asks if he could use it to pray.   I am sure Ohio State had plenty of empty rooms for somebody to use if they asked.   
Should have tried praying in the transgender restrooms. 
Babies barely have changing rooms. Why would Muslims have prayer rooms in a place that is not religious? Scary logic.
OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT!
source?
REMOVE
CNN is *literally* running the story that he was scared and confused and that they are still looking for motives...
Can we get a citation for tax-payer funded tuition?
He had the right to a prayer room. That I can understand. There should absolutely be accommodations for religious reasons. But that is no reason to go on a rampage.

I am surprised they allow Joe to continue to have a show on MSNBC. Must be because they know their voter base doesn't wake up until noon. 
I cringed every time she kept saying that he was giving her a headache. This video was amazing. He was throwing truth right into their faces and they didn't know what to do. I love it.
Well shit. Can you feel the virtigo on the set? The cognitive dissonance and hypocrach is overwhelming poor Mica
Completely exposing the lies, propaganda, and hypocrisy.  Morning Joe getting back to basics!
She had nothing to say to it other than please stop. I hope libshits all get a nice logic headache soon
When they cut back to him laughing with the paper covering his face, that's just fantastic.
what time is morning joe on each day?
Good to see morning cuck bending the knee but MSNBC is still trash and Joe is still a giant mangia.

Morning Joe is cucked, but it is at least accurate in its scathing regard for the media.

It just shows how useless Obama has been for the last 8 years--he hasn't been able to save a single job and the labor force participation rate is the lowest it's been in 40 years. And then, less than a month after becoming President elect Trump saves 1,000 jobs. Trump is demonstrating what Obama should have been doing and I hope people are paying attention.

My hope, is that as Donald enacts these policies we stand for, that more and more people of the US and even the world will see why we elected Trump. It might take some of these hipsters walking into a grocery store and seeing how much more there dollars worth before finally accepting Trump. Either way I believe in our President, as I have since he first announced his campaign. If his time in the white house is anywhere near as remarkable and hard fought as his run for presidency, I think we're in for a fun 8 years ladies and gentlemen.
If you go off of what Trump said in his tweet on the 22nd, it's going to be a great 8 years! HIGH ENERGY!

IMO saying Tuck the Cucker could be seen as insulting towards Tuck. I would delete and repost it as Tucker the UnCucker.
Shes also a potential felon for falsely filing the pennsylvanian recount with the courts.

https://mobile.twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/803307680010014720?branch_used=true

Ive been posting this like a madman, possibly the most biggly piece of info of the recount and not 2 fucks have been given over this one.

Link is blog of retired attorney who knows pennsylvanian law and states she has committed felony fraud, 7 years in fed jail an option.
Really stupid decision on her part.

She's guaranteed herself prosecution.
Is that a real news site? Looks fake.
Nazi George is doubling down. The cell door swings wide open for the Nasty woman.

They will steal this election if we dont fight back. I havent seen this anywhere else though. If its true we could be fucked
Why isnt this on the msm?? Not even on drudge or infowars nor breitbart. Not cnn or fox?  And clintons team had filed to be on the law suit earlier today???

What in the fucks name is going on?  I hate being in the dark.

But the judge makes a decision in an hour so check the news.  Though local Wisconsin news are the only ones who are covering this.
It's rig recount or go to jail & if you pass go, don't collect $200 million dollars!
He keeps using that word "suspect" like the cop killed a guy who just might have been a terrorist instead of somebody getting killed in the act. 
Retards like this dude are ruining this country.

Just because he was black doesnt mean he deserves special treatment. Why wouldn't people call the officer a hero? Just because he is white? He saved god knows how many people by shooting that terrorist.


"Crime spree"

that's a new way to say radical islamic terror
He's a professional race baiter guys. Go through his history.

He makes the argument that people's focus on the student being Somali cause Somali to trend and that its unfair to focus on his race but not on the race of the cop and that white shooters don't have their racial background discussed.

* Yes they do, 'white shooter' is a media pushed stereotype, its even more degrading that they're trying to create a false common denominator in calling these kids white rather than learning where in Europe their family originates from

* His back ground is relevant when making any point about the dangers of immigration. Marginalise the point to a matter of statistics being misrepresented but at the end of the day its perfectly relevant to point out that this kid was very visibly affected by living in America and not in many positive ways, thus, maybe it isn't a good idea to bring more.

If a Somalian kid can't handle living in the US, stop taking Somalian kids in. When your city has a rat infestation (sorry for the seemingly racist analogy), you take measures to protect your house, you don't go out of your way to bring all the city's rats into your house.

These people have their own problems, let them sort their shit out before we begin trying to integrate them into western society. 
Mass-murderer? No one died except the terrorist.
Muslim intellectuals.
This guys has retweeted a lot of tweets sent to him using the "n" word.  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if these are all liberal dummy accounts set up by him and friends, or maybe just him, to try to emphasize some lame attempt by him to paint himself as a victim.  All of those accounts should be reported just to get them out of circulation.
I've been convinced for a while now that the Left literally wants more terrorism to happen
So a cop isn't usually praised for saving lives? Well, maybe we should start!
I love that he calls him a "suspect of a spree crime" as if to insinuate he did nothing wrong. This cop sees a guy literally murdering people, but yeah let's pretend there's a chance this guy was framed, or whatever nonsensical defense these clowns are gonna come up with.
Who is this idiot? This is like the third outrageous thing he has tweeted that I have seen on here. 
I've been tweeting to him pretty heavily since his tweet first showed up on Twitter. He's close to a meltdown
Are we really surprised that someone with the name Tariq Nasheed would be a terrorist sympathizer?
Maybe in your circles it's unusual to celebrate the police saving innocent lives, Tariq, but not in sane circles.
Do white people need to die before justifying the killing of a black guy stabbing people?  Would that make him feel better?
What a waste of resources. Sad!
This guy posts the dumbest shit. Don't know if troll or serious mental illness. 
This guy is ignorant as all hell. Ended up blocking him on Twitter. 
Why would he be called a hero for preventing countless deaths at the hands of a maniac? I just can't figure it out.
Not really surprising considering that they wanted a mass murderer for president.
Flat out racism, no "reverse" word needed
I'm sending a gift basket to OSU's police dept.

The Tariqs of the world can go fuck themselves, then they can go back to their 3rd mud huts.
If you go back and take a look at literally ANY of the Black Lives Matter hashtags (#BlackLivesMatter, or specific ones whenever a black person got shot by police), that guy is in EVERY hashtag, and he's all up in the hashtags related to Trump's cabinet picks also.
what a dumb shit
Different strokes for different folks and these folks might've had strokes. 
Fucking lol
It's also very unusual for immigrants who have been handed a brand new life courtesy of the American taxpayer to drive a car into a crowd of innocent people then jump out with a big knife and start stabbing people.  All this emphasis on him being a terrorist....it's very unusual.
So should the cop have just let the terrorist run rampant so that this guy could moan about how the police are useless and don't act?
*#*deport
Progressivism is a psychiatric illness, folks.
I mean, come on. It's 20-fucking-16.

It's okay to be a mass murderer, or even a violent oppressive dictator (and mass murderer).

But please don't imply that Mexico might choose to send criminals and rapists across the border rather than deal with its own problems. Racism is bad, okay?
Sounds like Tariq Nasheed should be hanged for terrorism. 
Looks like he forgot to switch accounts
Is this guy actually retarded?
Unusual to praise the cop of a mass murderer? lol wtf universe is he living in?
Liberalism is a mental disorder.
Tariq is a racist, just check out his twitter history and videos. 

Sad. 
Fucking disgusting. These animals need to be kicked the fuck out of this country 
"suspect" sureeeeee whatever you say bud
Also, here's that Tariq fucks IMDB page. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1821300/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 
so Black gets capitalized but white does not?

obvious racist
I saw this and was disturbed. Not triggered. So I found it on twitter and did a bit of shitting on him. Then found my twitter account needed to be verified again. I was professional in my tweets and let him know he's an idiot. But nothing slander or vulgar. Twitter sucks, this guy is a racist idiot, and if you want to see what I wrote I can post. 
Can we send him to the middle east and see how he enjoys all the freedom they have? Fucking libs trying to cuck up our country because they live in safe spaces. 
Well... Even though the Somali Refugee is not a citizen, he is still innocent until proven guilty in a court of law right?

Except that this Tariq person is taking political doublespeak to a whole new level.
I mean, they praised dictator Castro so...
Get this fucker out
we're not a racist country if the glorification of the cop's actions is racist, yet "unusual". 
They think if they keep screaming they will get what they want, they wont.

What they are going to get is a Great America.
He's not wrong, it *is* unusual for this much emphasis being placed on a cop being a hero... Which is one of many reasons why we voted for Trump instead of that corrupt bitch and her beta male veep. 
He's race baiting.

Ignore him.
The left meaning who? I'm a Democrat and don't support this reaction. Neither do my other friends who also happen to be white liberals and some of them Somali-Americans.
When they go low, we go SHARIA!
How is the terrorist black?  Isn't he just a Somali?
'shooting a suspect' if you have a weapon. and the cop tells you too drop it but you dont, THE COP WILL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF! god... GET SOME FUCKING COMMON SEN... oh wait the left is incapable of common sense
Spreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
This kind of deflection happens all the time, #illridewithu (a hoax) started before the victim's bodies were even cold, they're trying to control the narrative and redirect attention/outrage away from their muslim pets.
"suspect" yeah innocent until proven guilty, but multiple EYE FUCKING WITNESSES might kinda slant the board here ...
wtf is this shit? Are we fucking that fucking down the rabbit hole. FUCK ME, TAKE YOUR FUCKING COUNTRY BACK FROM THESE INSANE FUCKS
Does he even...common sense? Like... what? Dafaq.

Spez: I might be the next one to suffer a meltdown, as I cannot comprehend - cannot take this much stupid anymore.
"Suspect"
Just imagine, a civil servant acting in the role of a peace office being parading as a hero for enforcing law the protecting the lives of innocents. 
He plowed through a crowd of people, got out, and started hacking them with a machete. No suspect, cop saved peoples' lives.
His name's Tariq Nasheed......'nuff said.
Who even is this guy? Never heard of him.
Ah, author of The Art of Mackin. I take his political commentary super seriously.
Sooo according to this guy you just hug it out with the attacker??
What a piece of crap! 
Wow, someone has a guilty conscience. 
Even Keemstar calls him on it. I never thought I would see the day when Keemstar was the voice of reason.
#SPREEEEEEEEEEEE
spREEEEEEEEEEEEEE crime
No, that's not very unusual. That's him doing his fucking job!
He's from LA and his parents taught him to hate us. Should be the expected response. 
maybe he's a comedian...
How the fuck is this man verified?
California not even once. Fuck these fascist racist lefties. I dont want them in my country anymore. That is clearly a racist insult to a cop who saved college students from being macheted to death by a somalian. I say this guy is worse than the KKK and should be treated as a terrorist supporter.
Clearly those people all wanted to be stabbed and run over.
>WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH
The left is at least doing a worse job of hiding their insanity. They used to have me fooled that they were just a little bit misguided. Now I know that a lot of them are totally delusional, and most of them get all their news from the fake news sources at CNN and the CNN-Lite stations, all pre-digested and fully illogical.
As much as I despise the left, this guy isn't primarily representing them. He's just a straight up racist.

He tweeted in support of the CEO of that fast food delivery service (such a great, successful company that I've forgotten the name) who threatened to fire anyone who voted for Trump. Something along the lines of "he is proof that not all white people are racist."

A quick scan through his feed will show you he's just a massive racist who revels in violence against whites. He did block me for having a different opinion to him, so on that hand maybe he is a liberal. But then who the fuck knows what these people stand for anymore?
He's supporting his own brother of the faith.

Check the name.
OUT OUT OUT!
Wait a sec. This guy is pointing out a big problem actually. It is unusual for this much emphasis to be placed on cops for being heroes for shooting active murderers. 

We should correct that by heaping even more praise on our police!
I've told every liberal person I know. If a prominent liberal that they are supposed to support stood up and ate a baby in front of them. They, as a liberal, would find a way to justify it.

Proves my point... again.
Being the voice of dissent, he is right. In most spree events (spree shootings), the media spends way too much time trying to untangle the shooter's motivations for the sake of views / clicks, and end up glorifying the problem person to no end.

This time, they're examining the cop. Thats VERY unusual, if not unprecedented.
I kind of feel bad for these people, the idea of seeing the world through that view, that race/sex/etc. is the reason behind everything.
Who's his hero? Fidel Castro? 
I wonder how interesting this guy would look like on a boat headed back to his home country. 
Are we absolutely sure that this isn't a parody account? Look at some of its other posts. 
He done gone full retard
To bad he didn't drive into a crowd that this d-bag was in!
I thought he was being sarcastic. 
The MSM will try to ruin this cops life, I guarantee it. 

Will BLM protest the killing of an innocent black man who just "had a bad day but was otherwise a nice guy"? 
Nasheed has a whole page in his book The Art of Macking that supports Donald Trump. 
The left refuses to acknowledge the fact that Islam is incompatible with the left. HOW MANY ATTACKS DOES IT TAKE? Why do they think we have some obligation to just let people through our border?
I propose we make a new subreddit called "Why Democrats Lost" and just post this kind of shit....maybe then they will understand
Your title is asinine, juvenile, and don't give this jack-ass more "air time".
dat cop be raysis
Mass Murderer? Did I miss something? When I went to bed last night, there was only one person dead and it wasn't a victim.
Man what the hell is wrong with people why do these people make race an issue. The attacker was obviously distributed and he himself attacked people not the people who share his skin color. 

Edit changed a word.
I really want to meet this person in real life. I want to give him a solid, unsolicited punch to the face, and tell him that he deserved it not because of skin color, but because of his blind hatred and bigotry.

I just watched [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5fh1vx/blm_doesnt_want_you_to_see_this_video_and_soros_i/) and this person needs a wake up call.

I know a punch to his face won't wake him up, but he's clearly delusional in his own lost world that all I want to do is forcefully deliver the message to him that he's being beyond an idiot.

May he wake up from his delusions soon, because the world can be so much more beautiful if you aren't looking at it through hate.
they've always been the party of hate. it's great that more people are awakening. it's great that people now see that the republican party has always been the one of inclusion. in fact -- the republican party was created primary to oppose slavery. the 13th amendment, abolishing slavery, passed in 1865 with 100% republican support but only 23% democrat support in congress. why you might find this hard to believe if you're a democrat? because they control the media and lie to you on a daily basis. they project their hatred and racism onto the right.
What the cuck?! How many cuckbabies are currently running the world?
oops. Fidel was a playah.
Frank Marshal Davis' son running the US and Fidel Castro's son running Canada. Globalism is Communism 2.0.

It's only a matter of time until being anti-pedo is not politically correct.
Stupid arguments  that don't deserve discussions. No thought crimes, nobody can police what's in your head no matter how disturbing,  degenerate,  or illegals. Actions--the law is clear as are the consequences.  Seems simple enough. If ya need therapy or distractions,  do so, but if you think normalizing it will work, then you probably work in dc
I hate to be that guy, but I do think that pedophilia is an illness. 

I think It should be managed by chemical castration and counseling so as to avoid all temptations. However, giving in to your illness or refusing treatment and committing a vile crime should be punished to the fullest extent of law.

I feel similar about the gender disorders, I don't think cutting your dick off is a valid treatment for a mental illness.
This cancer needs a cure.
And treason
they already made sex with animals in canada legal - cant make this shit up.
It's not normal, its a hideous violation of the most vulnerable. They can fuck off with this shit.

If legalized proposition would cull this, sex slavery, rape, etc, I'd be for it. 
This one is easy. They know the story will break- sooner or later, and they're trying to normalize it because there will be scores of figure heads that are exposed. 

You will get the CNN response of "well it's Trump's fault", MSNBC will blame the children for being so seductive, NPR will speculate whether or not Trump was the mastermind of the pedo ring, Washington Post will call it white nationalist fake news, Huffington Post will call it ageist, and Breitbart will call it pedophilia.
So by this logic, rape is also not a crime. 

degenerate idiots. 
I can't even figure out who the alt right is or what they believe. I know we're just Trump supporters and basically what Republicans were before the neo cons.
The media have confused everyone by calling our brand of conservatism "alt-right" which already has an established meaning steeped in white nationalism. If anything, we're traditional conservatives and all the pro-amnesty, pro-immigration, pro-globalization Republicans are the neocons. There wouldn't even be a need to rename us, except we're against the establishment GOP since it's been taken over by "liberal conservatives" whatever that is.

Sad.  Again, WTF is wrong with the "Left"?
Seriously, there are only like two radio shows where I live that I dont hear shilling against him. They keep claiming there's no evidence of it. Ok then, let's audit LA County and prove him wrong.
Check out this article:

"Do non-Citizens Vote in US Elections" by J. Richman, G. Chattha, D Earnest, published in the academic journal Electoral Studies in 2014. 

This paper is a big deal. Research is published in an academic journal after it was reviewed and approved by other researchers. It is a total BTFO when the media claims no evidence to support illegal immigrant voting. 

Facts from this peer-reviewed publication for redpilling others:

1. About 25% of illegal immigrants are registered to vote.
2. In the 2008 elections, the best estimate is 6.4% of illegal immigrants voted. That was 1.2 million votes.
3. In the 2008 election, 82% of these 1.2 million votes went to Obama
Illegal immigrant voting likely gave NC to Obama in the 2008 election and at least one US Senate race
4. The authors support their claim for NC because a 5% of greater illegal immigrant turnout would have accounted for Obama's margin of victory
5. Illegal immigrant voting of only 0.65%, less than 1%, in MN was enough to elect a Democratic in 2008 to the US Senate seat

Photo ID laws will not stop illegal immigrant voting. The solution is proving citizenship when voter registration occurs (my comment: voter ID laws will reduce other types of fraud so they're still valuable)

Too complicated.
Why would anyone allow people who do not belong in their Country to have any say in what the Country does?  It make no sense and leads to the death of the Country.
Another point to throw out there, though not direct evidence of illegals voting. Back in March, WSJ published the results of their survey on illegals and healthcare. They surveyed 25 counties in the U.S. that had the highest densities of illegals and found that 750,000 were receiving healthcare via state initiatives , even though that is specifically prohibited by the ACA. 

So if three-quarters of a million are getting healthcare illegally, why would we think they aren't voting?

It's one of the many things that makes him great. 
People on my FB feed keep sharing goofy pics of DT with captions that say,"Trump wants this banned from the Internet, so share it". I'm over here thinking, Trump doesn't care about a goofy photo of himself, he probably thinks it's hilarious.

I love Trump's funny faces. He's awesome. Hope he never changes. 
Anti-Trumpers are busy posting pictures of the Don.

Let that sink in.






^They ^^secretly ^^^love Trump!  
Does anyone know what he was reacting to, here?
#We have the best facial expressions, don't we folks?!
We don't care about political correctness or this social justice agenda. What makes them think funny face pictures would matter? 

This is all a part of the grief cycle.
one of my fav gifs
KEK we are the ones who LOVE seeing his goofy ass looking expressions.
Trump is possibly the quirkiest candidate ever to run for office...and I wouldn't have it any other way. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MMKFIHRpe7I
he is just adorableüòÜ
He's real. Unlike Hillary who had to be told when to use voice inflection and when to smile. She can't even smile without a cue card.
Pence already knows the outcome
Holy fuck. This is what it feels like to have a President 
**CURRENT PRESIDENT** is a disgrace
When is Liam Neeson going to play as Castro in a movie honoring his life and achievements?
Source please
Why you posting a pic of Trudeaauauauuu?
CNN already fact checked this, the information was false, nothing to see here, carry on 
I might get tired of all this winning before he is even in office! (I won't)
Some jobs.
This hurts to watch....
I need help spreading this please!
Only scum would down vote your post.
**This deserves a sticky and a daily repost!**
The absolute #1 problem we have in America is not our law enforcement officers do not have multiple body, vehicle, and weapon mounted cameras.   
  
We are approaching a point where this technology is reliable and affordable.    
  
We keep doing this circle of blame where if we had clear video, we could quickly shut these uninformed individuals down.
  
Total respect for our law enforcement officers, but we need the foremost transparency with every single one of these incidents.
And know we know why Soros funds this. Divides the country by race and helps destabilize it with quasi civil war and inflaming tensions. 
Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy upon us, sinners.
Mod sticky please
Think of how sad all this is by itself and then consider that a man like Soros, and his hired goons, are trying to throw more gasoline on this fire just to see which flag they can get to fall next.
This is truly depressing 
We must get this stickied 
Damn, that was powerful. So hard to watch, but it must be seen.

Jesus.  
I wasn't ready for that.
Fuck BLM. 
God bless our men and women in uniform.
Infuriating.

Black Lives Matter needs to be denounced by Trump as terrorist organization.
Holy shit. And now I feel sadness.
Repost this at peak hours homie
Holy fuck. I haven't watched a video that affected me this much in a long time. Great job whoever made this.
This shit makes me sick to my stomach. How can people legitimately say these people aren't important. They risk their lives to protect the citizens of this nation from violent morons with guns every single day, every "routine traffic stop" is another opportunity for someone to pull a fucking gun on them and kill them, I don't think these libtards realize that or how much the police force actually does for the protection of the people. 

Seeing that veteran dad come home to be with his family only to die and have his son outlive him like that... The salute of a son to his dead father only fills me with sadness. The fact that this "movement" calling for dead cops would be glad for his death simply for the color of his skin and the fact he went to war for his country absolutely disgusts me. 

I'm currently serving in the Navy, and I have nothing but respect for all my brothers in arms, no matter what branch they're in, whether it's Army, Airforce, Marines, Navy, Police or whatever, and anyone who dares to disrespect any of us, no matter what uniform you wear, should be shipped out of this country, absolutely abhorrent people. 
I really didn't need that before work. God damn, but I still plan to go to the academy.
FUCK GEORGE SOROS
It's so simple, everyone. When you watch this you'll feel what I did. Everyone is suffering right now. Everyone as people has been split and divided into so many different things now that there is little spirit left in us as a whole. No matter our differences, we all care for each other as humans. None of us were born wanting another human being dead. The things we are saying to each other as people are things we're saying out of frustration and anger that this entire system has been set up to divide us all.
God this makes me sick! HOW THE FUCK DO PEOPLE SUPOPRT THIS SHIT!!!! Yet DJT is the bad guy? HOW!?!?! God WTF!!! I just cant right now.... 
Is the officer with the neck wound okay? @ around 4:05
The feels man. Holy shit this hit hard.
Not surprised at all. This was always about money, and she's probably happier to have this happen, so she can buy that house next to fellow communist Bernie Panders 
Good. No need to drag it out. Now let's get this over with, declare Donald Trump the winner and go after the Clintons for their fraudulent Clinton Foundation. 
Good, I hope this sets precedence and makes it easier for MI and PA to shut this circus down.  
>Reuters reports that Sullivan has also been accused of murdering his elderly neighbor, John Bailey Clark, using a .22-caliber rifle he stole from his stepfather. Clark was found buried in a shallow grave behind his house, with three gunshot wounds to the head.

>Sullivan said he robbed Clark of $689, which he intended to use for the purchase of an AR-15 rifle and ammo for his shooting spree, but he has not formally confessed to Clark‚Äôs murder. The FBI found the stolen .22 rifle, along with some muddy clothes, a black ski mask, and a lock pick kit, hidden in the crawlspace of the Sullivan family home when they arrested him.


Wtf is wrong with his parents, their kid is a fucking degenerate and they are letting him loaf around on the internet all day with FBI agents. They had a field day with him.

Why didn't this dumb fuck have a job?
Wtf...is he Asian? His facial features definitely look at least partly Asian. How the hell did they get tangled up with ISIS?

"‚ÄúI liked IS from the beginning then I started thinking about death and stuff so I became Muslim,‚Äù he told the undercover agent."

Lol that's the most accurate quote on Islam ever.
Throw the book at this subhuman.
Only racists make everything about race.
There is nothing you can do with people like this. 
This pisses me off so much. The guy was TRYING TO KILL PEOPLE! Who gives a fuck what the dudes skin color was.
This same guy called Sheriff David Clarke a coon for supporting Trump. Big ol' moron.
You know what else is interesting? That Officer Horujko was nearby and able to shoot the terrorist asshole before he could hurt even more innocent bystanders than he did.

*Life Tip: Don't try to kill people and you won't get shot down in the street like a sick fucking animal.*
Wow what a piece of shit
OMG ! A police officer risked his life to protect innocent people from getting stabbed to death...
He must be a racist! 
OHMYGODOHMYGOD! Please, BLM, for the love of everything good in the world, start protesting this, PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE.
these race baiters need to find rocks to crawl under for next 4 years. 
small "w" for "white" and "B" for "Black".  Telling....

What an a-hole!
Oh, so it's ok to stab people if you are black? What the actual fuck??? D:
This guy is the biggest race baiting piece of shit on Twitter.

His entire feed is about white people.

He's a racist but he enjoys the protected class distinction of no one being able to call him out on it because in PC America black people can't be racist.
In the wake of the election, the Left has now openly allied itself with dictators like Castro and terrorists Abdul Razak Ali Artan.  
  
I predict Trump beats Kim Jong-un in a landslide in 2020.
He's garbage.

https://twitter.com/tariqnasheed/status/803153401026527233
This is why we won, folks. 
Tariq Nasheed made a living being a pimp. Now he pretends to be pro-black while making money bashing white people. Tommy Sotomayor destroys him constantly on youtube.
Because there's literally nothing more important about this situation than fucking skin color. jfc...
While police brutality does happen and is absolutely repulsive, this is not one of those times. What the fuck was the guy supposed to do in this situation? The term has been overused to death and lost all meaning, but colleges are supposed to be **ACTUAL** safe spaces, where people can go to learn and follow their passions without having to feel unsafe or threatened. Hence campus police. I'm a pretty big guy and have been wrestling and doing martial arts since I was young, but I feel a hell of a lot safer waiting at the bus stop at midnight with the campus police nearby. This isn't a race thing, or a political thing, it's just a guy doing his job, and doing it well. 
I bet Tariq listens to ISIS Nasheed
Tariq is just get very upset the Muslim Terrorist Abdul didn't succeed in his plan to murder mass amounts of White people. Sad!

Christ almighty. Some people are too far gone and this is a prime example.
remember stoping terrorists from killing people makes you racist
I could see this guy discovering all kinds of other little mysteries in life.


"I just touched that water, and you know what? It's wet. That's interesting."
He wasn't a suspect... he was caught dead to rights!
[Ok, which one of you did this](https://i.sli.mg/ZHkhLw.png)
Fuck this guy. People like him are why real racism against blacks burns fiery and alive. Thanks for the danger you flame for us you fucking traitor.
"Guys I stopped a terroist!" - Police Officer

"But YOUR A FUCKING WHITE MALE REEEEEEE" - Liberal 
Who is he that he's so important to be verified by Twitter? 
Stabbing "suspect". 

They just keep pushing the line for what is considered FULL RETARD. 
#Nottheonion  
Somali is a nationality and Muslim is a religion. No one mentioned race except the people screaming racism. 
Why are we putting up Tweets by random, frothing racist nobodies?
Wat. Just wat.
Not even gonna bother to write a rant or anything about this....
Reality itself said more than enough.
Wat.
Our enemy continues to make the same mistakes, let them carry on. This is why we won.

#TWO TERMS INCOMING!
What a disgusting dickhead. That hero killed a man hacking people with a machete within a minute of the attack starting. I don't give a fuck what the races were. A hero cop killed a villain. Suck a dick.
the  guy is a troll. he is using his minority card to get people to say something racist back to him so he can retweet it and further his narrative. don't give him the time of day
"from Los Angeles, CA"  I wonder why I'm not surprised.
CNN: White cop murders black man who did not have a gun.
lmao tariq nasheed the con artists who made 4 movies telling people people they have magic powers and that everyone great in history was black than turns out and calls other black people "black ass monkey"
I swear they get dumber by the day, "so interesting that a man who killed a rabid terrorist trying to kill others is being hailed as a hero, oh and he's white". 
The Bubble is real, identity politics is really all they have been fed for 2 to 3 decades now, how do we even begin to deprogramize these ideals?
Dude this guy tweets the most racist shit ever. I've seen him trending in every anti trump hashtag that ever comes up. 
Lol. I called it. I knew they would say shit like this.

This is why we need to end political correctness.
Yeah - it's always interesting when cops have to kill the bad guys!
Thank you Officer Horujko!
It would be a shame if someone's foot found its way up this guy's ass.
DOUBLE DOWN MOTHERFUCKERS!
Why is this guy verified? What could he possible be so well known for and contribute to the world other than this horseshit that flows from his mouth?
Not interesting, it's sad, what if the officer died? What would be the narrative than? He's the guy who put his life on the line defending our civilization. He stopped the attack which could have seen other people of any color/creed being hurt. Sideline commentaries like mine are meaningless compared to his heroism. This is as cut and dry as moral situations go. Someone wanted to do bad and someone stopped that from continuing. 

.....or this is racism. 
\>Man saves person's life

\>Person thanks man

###HOW FUCKING SHOCKING. 
What?? You mean officers responding to the scene of the attack didn't just stand by and let that nut stab more people?? Liberal logic
#TAQIYYA TARIQ
You can't even commit a murderous rampage without being oppressed by fucking white males anymore. At least have the courtesy of sending a minority cop to put the poor free spirited fellow down.
Uhh, yeah.  Because he is.
Why is this cunt verified? 
This is a perfect way to discredit everything you have to say in the future about anything that involves humans and their actions
Just stop giving these people attention
Tariq Nasheed, author of best-sellers such as "The Art of Mackin' (a fool of myself)"
"Stabbing suspect" - so why not "white officer who is suspected of shooting and killing..."?  I wonder what that's about. (I don't)
We'll admit it, this white cop is just continuing a horrible trend of shooting people who are a threat to others. Personally I wish the cop hacked him to death with a machete. 
Centipedes respect the hero for the hero's actions, not by race-baiting like this Tariq prick is doing.
We voted this piece of shit and the way he thinks out when we voted TRUMP. 
[Shut the fuck up you retard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkeuJyfACMQ)
Seeing this tweet and reading all these comments caused me some discomfort. First I should explain that I self-identify as a white male. This tweet and event just made me question the unearned benefits my race and gender provides me in our white patriarchal society. Through no fault of my own, I feel a bit guilty for the white privilege I have been granted while others have not been so fortunate. It makes me sad. But I know my sadness and tears cannot correct the world's injustices which makes me even sadder. 

Okay. I can't do this any longer. I'm happy he double-tapped the bastard. He's a hero. Man that was hard trying to write like a snowflake. Really painful. 

That officer was protecting black students who weren't threatening to kill anyone. But I guess those black lives don't matter??? 
HIJACKING for top keks

Bafoon is BTFO my OSU Mom and two based autists

The world would be a better place with this guy not in it.
His name sounds Japanese. 

But it's all about the skin to the likes of this racist.
I am stuck in the twilight zone.  These race baiters are out of their mind.
Annnddd so it begins, cucks gonna be rioting in the streets over this terrorist  motherfucker
Tariq just wants attention. Ignore the dummy.
Black, he said the word BLACK! racist
Holy shit - that guy's twitter feed is a hot mess.  
I just can't lol
I think the person who tweeted this needs a weeks vacation in Somalia. 
[Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/dqKeQiF.png)

I hope you like it
OUT OUT OUT
So racist black man and all around shithead Tariq Nasheed has a problem with white hero who saved people from black muslim terrorist and twitter doesn't ban his ass for hate speech.  Thats interesting.
He's a race-baiting moron, and he's getting exactly what he wants. A slew of morons dropping the N-word and death threats.

The reality is, we address this like everything else; with rational thought and reason.

*The officer, regardless of race, performed his duties to protect and serve his community. He did so with measured discipline, ensuring his engagement of a hostile subject with a weapon did not endanger innocent bystanders. Regardless of race, nationality, or motives of the subject, Officer Horujko's actions saved lives, and the praise he is receiving is fully warranted. The only thing that is interesting here is how race-baiting clowns are already scheming to use this as some sort of jumping off for further divisive politicking.*
What a dumb ass.
If it had been a black officer firing his weapon at a white assailant, would the tweet have the same meaning?  

What if it were a white officer and the assailant was a Hasidic Jew? Would he be claiming it to be an anti semetic act of aggression?


For fucks sake, it's a duly sworn law enforcement officer taking down an active threat who had just tried to murder people en masse with his car and a butcher knife.

Race of the two actors is just a footnote. Not the main story. 
"Suspect" is an interesting choice of words here.
Who the hell is this retard??????????

Did he miss the part when the Somalian ran into a crowd, students ran to his aid cuckfully thinking it was an accident, and he then stabbed those who came to help him?
Who is this racist?
Beyond retarded
Please tell me that's fake
These people are too far gone
damn no matter what they do, they play victim.
I stopped reading after Nasheed.
[He's not delusional at all (he is)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qqxsWGp_mEc)
he is verified, a verified idiot 
Written by the same person

"I can almost guarantee you if you go to a club where no one knows who you are, and you tell enough bold lies (like the ones I mentioned) to a number of females, one of them will be down to sex you up that night. And if a female is superficial enough to have sex with you because she thinks that you are a professional athlete, or that you own a Popeye‚Äôs Chicken franchise, then you should be superficial enough to tell bold-faced lies about what you do.‚Äù

Clearly an intelligent man who should be listened to and have his opinions respected.
HE WAS STABBING PEOPLE 

GODDAMN IT WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF MENTAL RETARDATION IS THIS

FUCK
If he's actively stabbing people, is he still a suspect? Genuinely curious. 
Who the hell even is this?
I tweeted back

"Because he shot a man who was trying to actively murder other people. He IS a hero."

Legit, I hate you fuckers, but sometimes we can all agree that people like Tariq Nasheed are stupid as fuck, right?
Why do these people have to exist...

Donald help us all.
Just look through the replies to his tweets. This dude may jump off a bridge tonight... 

Spez: I do really wish people would stop taking the bait and targeting him because of race.  No reason to call him the N-Word 
#REMOVE KEBAB
Kick it out
"It was just an observation"

No, you fucking clown. Saying "Hurr durr, a Somalian terrorist was killed by a white cop" 
is not an observation. It's obvious you're race baiting, and it shines almost as much as Hillary's yellow lying teeth.

The moment you use race to twist your narrative is the moment you lose the privilege to call your tweet an "observation".

Jesus Christ, first Fidel Castro, now this bullshit? The left really is losing their collective shit. 
LINK...must....troll...
This guy is the epitome of attention whore. His whole livelihood depends on it. He feeds off of controversy. He implies trump is a nazi sympathizer because he has a book written by Hitler. Haha 
TIL defense of others could become an issue of race.  
I don't get his humor here. 
Black people cannot commit acts of terrorism now. I didn't think BLM could go any lower.
a FUCKING WHITE MALE shot a black boy. That's the real story here!
Well, this guy is defending terrorism but will still keep his account. 
Get him the fuck out.
#FUCK YOU TARIQ
Fuck this guy.
How dare the officer save lives! How dare he risk his own life to take out a criminal!

I'm not for violence but someone needs to give that clown a good 1-2 to the jaw!
You mean the dude that was stabbing random people?  Yep that's the one, nice work, Sherlock. 
Deport this fuck!!
Capitalized black...?
Knowing I wouldn't be disappointed, I decided to dip my toe in the hell hole known as Tumblr and quickly came across this similarly minded post: 
http://mick-dreams.tumblr.com/post/153801169053/why-are-we-praising-someone-who-killed-someone

>Why are we praising this man for killing another human being who was only armed with a knife? They say ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bring a knife to a gun fight‚Äù but was this really a fight? The media is filling all of social media stating that this officer is a hero, but to me, he killed an unarmed person of color. This student felt like he couldn‚Äôt publicly pray, even though other religions have the freedom to do so as they please. Why is it okay for other religions to pray publicly but Muslims face scrutiny? 


A man, caught in the very act of STABBING is not a stabbing SUSPECT, he is a KNOWN STABBER!!!!
And now you have liberals complaining that we aren't taking right wing terrorism seriously by plastering some guys face on the front of r/EnoughTrumpSpam. Seriously, we're here calling for a solution to a serious problem and rejoicing in the fact that a based as hell police officer shot a terrorist before he could kill someone, and the people over there are just like:

*B-b-but there's a christian, white, right-wing terrorist who killed two police officers and th-there's no mention of h-him anywhere on r/The_Donald so-*

Grow the fuck up. Here we are having a discussion about what happened and how we think we can prevent it happening again, and then come the fucking liberal shills trying to make a fucking contest out of it!

It's not always us who are the ***REAL*** Deplorables. SAD!
Imagine having so little problems in life, that a guy stopping a murderer is not okay because the guy wasn't the race you wanted him to be, so you need to make a problem about it. God I wish I had that easy of a life.
So happy ending.  What's this dude's problem?
Why does he even use the word 'suspect'?  The guy was running around stabbing people. The whole approach of these people is to undermine facts and create a fake news agenda. 
Who gives a fuck what color the officer was? He stopped an asshole who ran over college kids and stabbed them like a psychotic muslim asshole. Deport this bitch Tariq.
That's right you losers, keep doubling down on identity politics. That's the ticket to win in 2020 and beyond.
Uh oh... so you're saying if I'm a black Somali refugee I can run people down with my car and stab people and I'll be ok as long as a white cop shoots me?? Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
tell me thats not real. how? just... how?
#So muslim somalian refugee Dirka Dirka, who drove a car on top of a bike rider and began stabbing fellow students with a knife, has the Mainstream Media baffled on what his motive is. That's interesting

FTFY
Weirdo is basically just in it for the retweets now I guess.
Does "Dumber Than Dirt" apply here?
Reported
Suspect
I'm tired of these mentally and emotionally stunted Marxists 
This has to phoshopped, or do they just live in alternate reality? 
He's right you guys, the officer should have waited for a black person to step up and do the job.


It's just a fact. 
Oh, the interesting parts are just coming in my deluded victim. This is going to be a long painful ride.
"suspect" 

I like how they're not mentioning how he ran over people in his car just like happened in France. 
"suspect"
Two words for Tariq- Fuck - you!! 
He could be a good Palestinian.
Hold up, did he delete that tweet? Because now his tweets are berating those who are playing ["the race card"](https://imgur.com/a/O15dw) and I can't find the one shown in this thread. The hypocrisy is deafening. 
Attention whore over here. All these attention whores. 
 BLM RIOTS!!! Burn this mther fcker down!
Tweeking Nutshed is most likely a fucking skinny. The suit doesn't fool us, Nutshed.
Ellsworth Toohey in real life.
What else would he be paraded around as? A villain? He isn't the one who tried to butcher people with a fucking machete he was saving lives.

Like I know mental gymnastics are a thing, but honestly how can *anyone* have *any* kind of doubt that this was the right course of action? Even the more liberal people in my FB feed are praising him. Like what the hell.

Spez (this is great by the way): Just read more of this idiots tweets. Hes a Castro apologist and professional victim as well, and sent three tweets about the finale of some HBO show where there was a sex scene. Like what the fuck is this idiot doing with his life.
Terrorist sympathizer?
He is a hero, he shot and killed a terrorist before he could kill anyone. 
Wrong.  Not about race.  It's American against terrorist.  Facts people.  Not phobia.  Facts.
>"suspect"

Tariq Nasheed has a deep-seated inferiority complex towards white people. White guilt has fed his victim mentality to avoid hard truths or responsibility for one's actions altogether.
"Hmm, ya know, I see that lunatic over there stabbing people and all, but he's black and I don't wanna be the next George Zimmerman!"
My buttcheeks clinched a bit. Not another AR15 rampage, not another AR15 rampage. ..stabbing? What the?
That's it. Next time this happens, cops should just sit back and grab some popcorn. Let's see how good these SJW's fight back (ROFL)
How many black people were saved?  Other people of color?
Gotta laugh at his twitter bio: Anti-Racism Strategist- Constitution Advocate

RIIIIIIIGHT!
these people are mentally ill.
Tariq Nasheed is a huge fraud. Tommy Sotomayor exposed him.
Oh please please please, BLM protest this! I fucking dare you 
Surely, true heroism would've been to allow a murderous psychopath to continue his campus rampage uncontested.
White people can't even kill legitimate terrorists now without being racist. 
He's melting down on twitter, calling everyone racist and white supremacist... Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... Hahahahaha. A cop shot a scumbag terrie, no more, no less. The amount of melanin either one of them have in their skin is irrelevant.
I mean come on. This can't be real
that is interesting...its almost like one person did something heroic and saved lives and is being publicly thanked for doing so...and someone else tried to kill a bunch of people, failed, and died.

#VERY FUCKING INTERESTING
Tariq sounds like he is about to snap. Scary racist commentary from everyday Lefties.
Alan Horujko stopped innocent people from dying.  Guarantee that's more heroic than anything Tariq will do in his pathetic life.
Twitter posts like these are just deflating until you remember that there is a whole industry that exists in America that relies on racism for their very existence.  Racism in America exists, but is no longer the real blight it once was.  The problem is that racial divide is now industry.  Guys like this keep it alive, because honest people believe them and give them money to help a cause that in reality is dwindling with each generation.    Assholes like this would be either unemployed or working in some other predatory field if it weren't for the race card.  They need racism to exist or they're out of work.  Knowing it's a fabricated persona not based in reality helps me cope with the nonsense they spew.
As a black man I am highly offended at the stupidity of some of my people. 
Brought to you by our esteemed friend of Kek, Jimmie Rustle. 
They have to believe, the stabber did nothing wrong.
Take this cuck to the cleaners!
HERO.
ITS BECAUSE HE IS A HERO YOU FUCKING FUCK, FUCK.
Communist Islamic sympathizers. Literally the worst people in the world. 
Tariq calls himself an author. All his books are about "macking". Real highbrow stuff.
Thank you, Al Sharpton. /s
Is this...real?

BTFO chodes, you are not relevant anymore!

\>suspect

Fucking what? 
Just seems strange how this continues to happen. Just because you have the same skin color doesn't mean you have some sort of "unbreakable bond" or that you actually know a single thing about the other person. So why the hell are you defending someone who harms other people? Simply to make some baseless comment about race? 
I am so sick of seeing that logic
Horujko should have waited for a black cop to arrive to arrest a black subject. 

If more people died, oh well....
Nothing interesting other than a hero doing his job. Tariq, you can calmly go fuck yourself with a rusted knife you ignorant retard. 
So Tariq nasheed empathize with the stabber and not the officers. That's interesting
No breh, being black should get anyone a free pass to try and murder people.
Tariq Rasheed: Black Supremacist, racist and the reason there are problems with racial equality in the United States.
Who the fuck is this guy? All these important people with check marks by their names think that entitles them to give their opinion on things they know nothing about. 
Seriously, who the fuck is he?
God dammit progressive. Can you give the race shit a break already?
Local LA news tonight showed 3 white on black crimes in a row, not a peep about all the black on black killings around the city or in any city. smdh

No wonder people are so racially divided.
I think he just killed the "human" who drove his car into other "humans" and then started stabbing them.
Who the fuck is this guy 
Eugh, I am ***SO*** #oppressed ! 
Someone put this guy on the terror watch list and no fly list.
This is satire right?
The replies to this guy's posts make pol look like a fucking mormon teenage summer camp.
Tariq, get outa Na Shed pls. Fam.
It doesn't matter what colour you are when you're a criminal. Sorry, this is not a hate crime to take down a perp. 
His mind is so fucked.

But I think he says this shit to race bait. He wants a race war by provoking garbage like this.

Sick minded. 
It is interesting! It would make a great movie!
I guarantee before the media said anything about the perps race this guy instantly assumed it was some nerdy white trench coated mofo. They're all racist. I applaud the officer and figure he'd have not pulled out paint swatches to decide the course of action.
Suspect????
Heroes are the ones that roll up their sleeves and get what needs done, done. It isn't all that interesting - just common sense.
Okay, idk about you guys, but idk if you can be white and have a last name of Horojko... 
Whys it always about race?
Yeah... I was blocked by this guy on twitter... must have triggered him.
what the actual christ
Typical race baiting like the MSM. Focusing on the wrong issues while further driving down the racial divisiveness of this country.
That Tariq sure is racist. Worst of it is, look at all of his retweets tonight:

https://twitter.com/tariqnasheed

Can't tell false flag from legitimate racist assholes on twitter, but it doesn't matter because anyone looking up to this guy will take those at face value. Fucking sucks.
I don't know who this guy is and I don't care. 
"Suspect"
It's okay that he was stabbing people, he's black. :/
Not interesting, Heroic. Weren't you paying attention?
What a fucking moron! Of course he's a hero.
He eliminated a terroist.  I'd say that makes him a good guy.
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
He's GOTTTA be trolling for attention. Can't be this stupid and he's just phishing in the comments. Not doing anything to clarify or calm people's rage against his statement
Professional victims... 
At a loss for words.

That should be the definition of a troll.
Why was black capitalized and white lower case. The microaggressions here. I'm literally shaking right now. What's going to happen tomorrow when I wake up and have to walk out the door. 
Nah I refuse to believe anybody on this planet is this damn stupid. 
So now we cant shoot innocent OR guilty people?!?
Tariq Nasheed is ig. no. rant. 
Oh hey, look at the alt-left..
Muslim apologists make me want to drink bleach. Of course he's a hero you cunt! So by your logic we should just let him impale college kids on his blade? 

Maybe Tariq should've offered himself as the first kill then, fucking twat.
They are psychotic.  Do not engage with psychotics.
This is literally race baiting, what the fuck is wrong with people man
You must go see his race baiting twitter account. He loves the race card and he loves the victim card it seems: https://twitter.com/tariqnasheed
I want to parade this hero on top of my shoulders around Tariq.
Why is that interesting?
Who the fuck is this guy?
yes he is. and i have no problem with that
Lost cause
>Tariq Nasheed

Really?!!?
He gets in an exchange with an Iranian-Australian women wherein he presumes her to be Indian.

Pretty much a racist.

https://mobile.twitter.com/tariqnasheed/status/803424861360009216
Here in **America**, when someone **neutralizes** a **threat** to the safety of the general public, we call them a **HERO**. 

**MAGA**
Who the hell is this guy?  I googled him but still don't know what he does except talk about racism all the time.
I think I had an exchange with this guy on Twitter. Yes, he actually believes this.
even CNN is reporting the officer as being thanked for quick response..  
 source CNN:
ohio-state-university-attack-police-officer-horujko/
Tariq Nasheed is a racist, this is typical of his spewing rants..
Race didn't even occur to me honestly.  Just thought of the guy as a Muslim terrorist wannabe until some lib had to make note of the races of the parties involved.
Who the fuck is this fag?
I've seen tweets from this guy before. He's an idiot.

HA we called it here first...you just knew it was gonna happen :D Fucktard.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtyUyYuiS-s
Surprised the MSM did not ask why the officer used lethal force when the Muslim had no gun...they can't make this about gun control so you're not hearing much about it in the media
Not like the Black Somalian was a *terrorist* or something. Not like he *deserved* to live. Not like Alan Horujko *saved* anyone's life. Not like...nobody asked your opinion *Tariq Nasheed*? Not like I'd be worried about being a *terrorist sympathizer* with a name like that. Just sayin...
WHITE. MALE. END OF STORY. RACIST AS SHIT.

Spez: That is what he meant to say. Also, I am a cuck.

Is this a real tweet? The fucker even acknowledged that the Somalian was a stabbing suspect. 
#INCENDIARY!#
Here we go!  Just like clockwork.
This guy is horrible. A friend of mine on FB keeps screencapping this shit head it's so annoying.
((UNKNOWN MOTIVE))
I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain this to him
*SUSPECT?*
Please tell me this was a joke post?!?! WTF. 
You cannot make this shit up, ffs
Of course he's verified on twitter. 
He's trolling, right? 
Of course... always their kind. Never fails really and I'm tired of it. If we would have lost to the insane fuckers of the left this shit would have gotten EVEN WORSE! (This guys not the only one btw there are more idiots like him)
This is what happens when you can't see past your own black nose.
It's interesting that the guy who killed the guy that was trying to do a killing spree is being paraded as a hero? 

Cucks find the weirdest shit interesting.
He should have just let the fucker keep stabbing i guess?Wheres the logic? (there isn't any)


What a piece of shit. Was the cop supposed to help the terrorist kill civilians then? Race card us losing all meaning
Yeah it's interesting......interesting to prove why we voted for someone who said were so politically correct we are unable to move forward. 
link? Can't believe this is real.
Just look at where he sent that tweet from. Commiefornia
Yes, he did.  He sent that demon straight to hell.  It makes me so happy we have folks like that protecting us. :)
Fuck me, I'm fatigued.
I'm confused...What's interesting about it? 
If this were a black officer who shot a white Christian man, and a white man made this exact same tweet with the races reversed....

That man's life as he knew it would be over.  Every media outlet and liberal would come down on him like a ton of bricks.  He MIGHT be able to find a job as an undocumented shit shoveler at the Steve Irwin zoo on the east coast of Australia or something.

Yet to liberals, this racism is perfectly acceptable because it targets evil white people.
He is a HERO!
An officer. Not a white officer. Just a cop. "Responsible Person with a Gun" 

#RPG
They'd prefer that the son of a bitch runs wild until a black officer shows up on the scene to kill the stabbing suspect. Who am I kidding? They riot **anytime** a police officer kills a black person, even if it **is justified** like in this case.
Uh...? Yeah, he stopped someone who would've otherwise killed a bunch of people. I would call him a hero. Is murder okay now as long as you're black?
Yea, he should have waiten for another somali officer to come and do it so no one could call rasist.. /s
Just looked through his posts. He's a vile human. I hope he does go to that guys Pennsylvania and gets his. 
Racist
lol; these idiots love race based discussion. what a bore.
Some people are slow to catch on to the difference between good and evil...
These people are floating away into outer space. There is no reasoning with them.
Behold the face of the new racism.
By looking at his page, I think he was being intentionally inflammatory.
They tend to defend their own kind. They're plugged into the Zerg hive mind.
Thank you God for not making me so freaking stupid
If my name were Tariq Nasheed, I would lock it in a cage and burn it alive with gasoline, and then pick a better name.

Seriously, that name is the sound of someone trying to not sneeze in church.
I really hope idiots like this don't spread to Gab
... What a fucking idiot. Some people are hopeless.
What a nasty guy.
**ANOTHER FUCKING WHITE MALE**
Deport him.
This guys is literally retarded  
"Suspect"? I think you meant "perpetrator"
This guy's IQ can't be higher than 40. No one can be this stupid.
Years of left wing propaganda has fried this mans brains. It's quite possible this guy has been lead to believe his whole life that white people are evil, or that we have some sort of system that "holds blacks down", at this point he is in the same mind state as Scientologists. He's surrounded himself with this nonsense for pretty much his whole life and cannot be saved.

Racist cuck
May I point out that he had a knife, refused to put it down, and was therefore preventing first responders from gaining access to victims? 
I'm from r/all and HOLY SHIT is this guy fucking serious? What a fucking moron.
Sounds like something a terrorist sympathizer would say. TARIQ!
What is BTFO?
This guy is a consistent cunt on every single thing that happens. He thinks he's smart but my God what a cunt. 
Ngl, first /r/The_Donald post i've ever seen that made me think "send this to the top"
Damn whitey killing the totally justified black guy, who might I add, is only suspected of running down people and stabbing them... /s
Wtf is wrong with this dumbfuck is he actually braindead?
I would say this guy needs to go play in traffic, but it's LA so he likely won't get hurt.
Yeah how evil of that white guy to stop the random black guy from killing and attacking students of every race. Lmao wtf????
HOLY FUCK. 
Would this guy be happy if this officer arrived at the scene and immediately suicided himself? 
sounds like that bitch is not AN AMERICAN

#GO FUCK YOURSELF "SHEIK TARIQ"
Something something poes law.
He forgot to add "victim did not have a gun".
Don't sweat it. I've read through this guy's twitter and he is a grade A troll. He always tweets edgy and controversial shit for attention.

And we all remember one of the most important rules of the Internet:

#DON'T FEED THE TROLLS
"----- Officer shoots actively -------- stabbing attacker" - corrected
Somalian ain't black stupid.
So....  If a black officer shot this fellow,  then the officer would be labeled a race traitor?? 
Shaun King will be shitting his diaper in the Daily News tomorrow.
These people are truly mentally ill.
Always look at the location of the Tweet.

**Los Angeles, CA**

There you go. A whole 'nother country commenting on U.S. affairs.
They can't be fucking serious.
I know!  He forgot to say he was ALSO a muslim.

Ya he stopped a psychopath, that was plowing down crowds of people with his car then if that was not enough he got out of the car and then stabbing them with a butcher knife, so ya I think he's a legit hero! All day long
We've come full circle: people are so "liberal" that terrorists are seen as the good guys when the good guys save peoples lives. This kid should be euthanized. 
Are these morons for real? 
Get your shit together, tariq!
That fellow has to be trolling.

Luckily, the post doesn't seem to be gaining much traction. 

Allahu Ackbar!!!!!
**WHEW LAD**
Is this guy a troll account or a legit moron?
Oooooooohhhhh, this is guy is a woman-hating "mra/pua" cretin who's moved on to being a race huckster.

Fuck this robo, seriously.
Wow. And they call us deplorable? SAD! 
These truly are the most viliest scum on planet earth. 
Are you fucking kidding me? 
What an absolutely delusional and psychotic moron...this is so pathetic!
Terroristlivesmatter
Where do these fucktards come from? I mean really, what the fucking fuck? I know it would be dropping down to his level of idiocracy, but this dude needs to be located and deported to the country of his choice since America is so bad. He should not be allowed to procreate more nut jobs of his ilk in this country. Get em out.  
Why is that interesting Tariq? Your penis get mildly erect thinking about it or something? Fucking asshole.
Naggers gonna nagü§î
Freaking nignogs ugh 
People like this deserve to have their ass kicked just so we can watch them whine to the policeman about how they were assaulted.
Calm down there, NASHEED.
Nasheed needs to work on his attitude.
After watching that video of the Russian defector talking about brainwashing an entire generation and it actually being real is very disturbing.
You have got to be kidding me.
More interesting is that this "black" Somalian will probably be insulted as black often means African and Somali Muslims will identify as Arabs. 
Say it with me...

#Hero!
RACE TROLL
They will never learn
I wonder if BLM will protest (riot)
Gun violence happened. The very best kind of gun violence. On this day, good triumphed over evil. Innocent people were hurt, which is sad and unfortunate, but an evil person is now rotting in eternal Hell.  

I'm not religious but I like to think a horrible afterlife exists for pieces of shit like this.
He's a hero, that's why this is so interesting. Guns save lives.
Tariq Nasheed is a fucking moron. Everytime I see one of his tweets I lose brain cells.
This losers entire livelihood is based on being a victim.  While people do real work this clown cries on Twitter whining about white supremacy. Really he has an undiagnosed mental condition like most liberals.   
This dude is always spouting off inflammatory racist comments.  Surely he's just a troll account.  No one can be that dumb.
What's the deal with his last name?   Is he an ISIS supporter ?   I know not all nasheed are terroristic music, but ISIS only listens to nasheeds 
America is becoming Israel? /s
He killed a monster, that is all that matters.
Interesting?  And who the fuck is Tariq Nasheed exactly other than a racist prick?
The cogdis is so overwhelming all he can say is "that's interesting".

What's interesting is that his worldview is so cucked up, if the terrorist had been the one paraded as a hero, that wouldn't have been interesting.  It would hsve seemed like the right thing. 

To my mind this is almost like giving aid and comfort to the enemy. This muslim arab needs to be surveilled. Find out who he knows and what they're up to. See if his mosque is preaching hate. Then take action if so.
"Suspect"
This guy is on the morning sports show in Boston on WEEI. This dude is fucking crazy. Hes saying black oppression in America is exactly the same thing as nazi concentration camps.
What incredible logic. This man is truly enlightened. Geesh why does america have to suffer from stupidity...
Good guy killed bad guy. It's that simple. Stop making everything about race. It doesn't apply to every situation! 
He's not a suspect. He was literally shanking people and the man shot him. 
You have to admit he has a point. Since when has anyone who risks his life thwarting a mass murderer been considered a "hero"? It probably has something to do with white privilege or institutionalized racism.
I wish we could just kill these people.
They're going to go public soon. This is monumental. I hope you guys realize how big this is.

Can't. Fucking. Wait. My god, I can't wait to feel vindicated at work. All of a sudden, they'll realize they were the stupid ones and they will look at all of us *very* differently.
*THE TRAIN STOPS FOR NO ONE*
Can you explain what this means, pede?
Romney predicted the rise in antagonism with putin and everybody laughed, maybe he is also the man to negotiate a peace.  Maybe there's some classified info on russia that makes romney a good fit.
Yes I know. Romney got GOP backing, he is a way to expand Trumps coalition with Romney voters, he is vetted and knows his way around.

Downside is it would allow for the GOP to beeline their foreign policy through Romney bypassing Trump and that Romney was extremely never Trump.
I don't get what foreign policy experience Romney has. He was the governor of Massachusetts. And CEO of some wall street bank. That's it?
I still think he is going to ask him to hold the keys to his business. 
HAHAHA, EVERY DAY IS A MIRACLE IN TRUMP'S AMERICA 
#WATCH THEM TAKE THE BAIT WITH PEPECORN!
Could someone explain this for me? How is this 99dchess? Like whats the goal?
The easiest way to solve this problem is to certify US flags as Government Documents, then copyright the design.  You can't make the flag without permission from the government (this is a nominal service but imbues the flag with government property status).  When a flag is burnt, it is then the destruction of government documents.  That has fines, jail time and prohibits you from ever holding public office.
This 4D Chess thing overuse is retarded. He isn't playing shit, he's just proposing a punishment for flag burning. That's not 4D Chess just because it's been proposed before. 
And we don't get offended at everything under the sun like whiny babies.
FEEL THE BERN
I'm not offended, it's just a confederate battle flag with historical value. The American flag is the only one I truly care about. Them burning the actual American flag and waving a communist or Mexican flag just solidifies my resolve to vote Trump again in 2020.
To the top!

No problem with American flag burning either -- but lets all appreciate who does that sort of thing and why. Just nasty people. Don't we want to get to work?
So let me get this straight.  This nut job kills some cops and happens to be white and christian.

Meanwhile, some other nut job tries to kill some people because of his race and religion.

See the difference?
Who said what about whom? Spreading his name gives him power.

Read this CBC article; carefully.  Of course it employs Pretzel logic LOL.

I‚Äôve highlighted the fun parts:

It was Castro who gave Michel the lifelong nickname Miche during Pierre and Margaret's official visit to Cuba in 1976. On that trip, the prime minister found an intellectual sparring partner (and **Margaret, according to historical accounts, found brief respite from her personal struggles with life in official Ottawa)**

But Castro wasn't merely a pal of Justin Trudeau's dad. **And Justin Trudeau isn't merely Pierre Trudeau's son.
The world is far more complicated than that.**

http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wherry-trudeau-castro-1.3871016

Pictures and Justin‚Äôs height are interesting too!  A must see if you‚Äôve missed it:

She remembers Castro during that visit as a ‚Äúvery warm and charming man ‚Äî **I enjoyed him.‚Äù**

http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/margaret-trudeau-fondly-remembers-1976-trip-to-cuba-and-the-charming-dictator-who-cuddled-her-baby
I don't know, if you look at younger pictures of Pierre Trudeau and his expressions, you can definitely see a lot of Justin.
Castro's stealth plan for world dominance continues.

Their false narratives require a lot of confirmation biases from propaganda techniques. However, their false narratives can become red pill pivots. Propaganda only works if you have an epistemic failure - your system or disposition of knowledge has to totally collapse. 

But we will win in the end because the longer people think about something the longer people think critically about it. They are running on pure fumes - false narratives without evidence. Thinking is bad for their side. ...this isn't even a partisan battle. So keep it up.

When he literally broke out into a rage with tears. I knew he meant it. Even though Ive been watching and listening to him for years there was this nag in me that I was just being fear mongered. But when that happened before the election, I knew he was really one of our heroes. Thanx Alex for everything.

And a thank you to Mr. Alex Jones for keeping the fires stoked!
Alex Jones is more than a Journalist, or Conspiracy Theorist, he is an American Hero. A genuine, bonafied patriot and hero and god damnit, and he deserves respect. Do not let anyone smear Alex Jones. He is a great man, and as honest a journalist as we will ever know. Is he perfect? Of course not, but at least he is not selling out his values for anything or anyone.  I once laughed at him 10+ years ago when he still talked about ET. Not anymore. He has matured, and so have we all. Globalists are real, they are a threat to our way of life, and they have to be stopped. Jones was right so many times so consistently one can scarcely call him a "Theorist". He is more like Conspiracy Expert rather than Theorist. Praise the man. Seriously.
We are the reporters now!
Alex Jones thank you for all your years of service to freedom and information. People like you are a rare breed and we appreciate you greatly. Please keep doing what you're doing! Maga!

He said named this sub specifically during the broadcast yesterday. Based AJ is based.
I love the guy. He puts it all on the line for all the right reasons. Yeah he gets stuff wrong, but he gets a ton of stuff right. Stuff that most people would be too afraid to even report on. He has broken so many things that I thought were insane, but they turned out to be 100% accurate. A man ahead of his time.  A true journalist and inspiration.

His scene in Waking Life is powerful stuff. 
Now thats using your *brainforce*
So this gets its latest news stories from the guy who gets his latest news stories from the sub?

Serious question - When did Alex become so religious?  In the last year?
Listening to InfoWars at work really helps pass the time!!!
Alex Jones is nothing more than a conspiracy theorist.

It just so happens we happen to live in an insane bizzaro-reality where the conspiracies are actually *true*.

(Off-topic: Please tell me I'm not the only one seeing the parallels between George Soros and Bob Page of the original Deus Ex.)
Was this ever in question? Reddit is for all intents and purposes the front page of the internet for millions of people.
Love you Alex Jones :-)
#Hi, ALEX!!!! 
Alex Jones is a complete fucking looney tunes nutbag, but I love 'im all the same because without folks like him your brain gets stale with the same old same old and never thinks about anything different.  
  
And he's entertaining as hell.  
  
Without the Alex Joneses (sp?) of the world we would all be SJWs by now.
Obligated was I, to nod to this. 
Love Alex Jones.
A wonderful American gentleman, a patriot warrior and a high energy man, constantly fighting to break conditioning.  Kindly clone and send to England.  Regards.
My mouth has dropped after what's been going on and how on fucking point Alex has been. I have no one in real life to tell or they would hang me. T_D is my home!
Now stop trying to sell holy water and we will love you even more
Any suggestions on similar YouTubers? Love the guy but can only handle so much. Also I keep getting tempted to buy his sh!t

Alex, I want an official InfoWars shirt that says "The Big Enchilada". Please/Thanks!
Pizzagate isnt real, its confirmation bias.
Alex, you discredit yourself by selling nutritional supplements, something you are not qualified to endorse or sell. Makes you look cheap and crazy. 
pizzagate is a load of cock and bull that's dragging us down

we actually had some cred, some runs on the board with wikileaks and then some IDIOTS ruined it 

i mean get real. That fricken logo looks NOTHING like the boy-love symbol of the FBI

what a load of shit

We need to Seriously turn this sick narrative around!

Oh lawd. Bless their little hearts.

This lady is an idiot.  If she is such a proponent of headscarves, why isn't she wearing one.  Not to mention--who in their right mind wants to have solidarity with a terrorist?  Doesn't it make more sense to stand up on behalf of the victims of this senseless attack?  Oh, that's right, she is of the "left mind" where you can convince yourself terrorism in the name of Allah is a good thing.
Wow.

These people have really lost it.

I disagree with God emperor and Hilary on this one, I think freedom of speech protects even vile and offensive speech. While I don't support flag burning, I don't think it is the right of the government to say what can and can not be said.
Dopey Stein missed the deadline. Now let's enjoy the tears of the SJWs who donated money to the scam of a recount fundraiser!
So are the recounts even happening or have they already?
I'd like to thank Jill Stein for stealing money from Hillary supporters. Well done.

Cucks BTFO
Don't get too comfortable with all the winning.  We still have the electors to worry about.  There's a mutinous party called "the Hamilton Electors" who intend to flip their votes to Hillary:

Hi I'm Jill Stein's lawyer for the recount. Respectfully, could you guys postpone this thread for two weeks? 

I'm trying to get a pool for my backyard and need as much money as possible 
Is the recount going on right now? These are current posts?
Trump Rules!!!!!
According to this [page](http://billypenn.com/2016/11/28/how-the-pennsylvania-recount-is-going-so-far-in-philly-not-good/), affidavits of voters from only 74 out of 1,600 divisions were submitted. That means that the legal document [here](http://billypenn.com/2016/11/28/jill-stein-files-lawsuit-to-recount-pennsylvania-votes/) (at the bottom) on which the court has to decide is Stein's last hope.

I'm no lawyer, but my opinion about the file: It consists of unproved claims and focuses more on Russia's hacker potential and events which occurred weeks before the election than on things that are clearly related to a potential fraud in PA during the election day.
This thread wasn't posted in time. Sorry folks.
She was in TV doing on interview not long ago and she is high af. She gave like 27 different reasons for the recount and all of them came to the same conclusion. No proof...
We have to uncuck this damn American culture
This will just be used by the radical left to say we are racist, etc.  Far from the truth, at least to me.  I don't care if you white, black, or the color of a monkeys ass and I am tired of people not understanding that.
I just think people should respect the laws of this country, not try to evade them, or ignore them.  Just as they should not play ignorant of the law when it is clear they are lying, stealing, whatever.  English is the language here, please learn it. We should not be expected to learn a few other languages. In my life I have been in neighborhoods where Spanish, or Urdu or Farsi were spoken, I am not able to learn all these and should not be expected to. 

End of rant. Thanks for reading.  
  
Like election night all over again! üòÅ
Technically it's not the recount, just an error so far. Recount hasn't begun yet but I bet you Trump's lead will expand.
You know, all of this is really shedding light on the fact that voting in this country is a joke, and not just the voter ID laws.

Why was there even a 440 count error? Actually how difficult in today's day is it to simply sum up some numbers and add them to a state total?

It's a Computer Science 101 exercise, really.
would be awesome if Jill goes:

"oops, missed MI and PA but lets do CA, NH, NV instead. were all non partisan anti fraud people arent we?"
Have to throw out all the Hillary votes made in crayon
I would feel bad for Hillary if I didn't want her to burn in hell.
At this rate, fuck it, recount everything!

The winning never ends and I won't be tired of it ever.
Let's do a recount of California.
**ARE YOU TIRED YET?**

Please recount New Hampshire,Nevada and Minnesota.

Got a four on the floor and we are just going to have to add it to Trump's totals! 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frtVqCZub-0


This is why I am surprised Hillary has not put a stop to this
How do 440 invalid votes actually get counted.  That's a little crazy.
Recount WA next. No way in hell Pierce County was blue!
Also, the votes of overseas military (frequently uncounted because of mailing delays) can now be counted and will expand Trump's lead even further!

[Proof.](https://sli.mg/p4m1RL)
No, please stop. I'm so tired of winning.

No fuggin way...

Just keeps getting better
I am more confused about why they were lying about his original numbers. Or is it incompetence?
I KNEW this would happen. I love being right, I LOVE winning. 
üòÇüòÇ
BUT I'M TIRED OF WINNING
Didn't Trump already loose like 5k votes in Wisconsin though? 

I guess that was before the recount though. 

The US elections seems a bit iffy IMO - sure there can be small mistakes - but hundreds or thousands of votes at certain locations? 

Insanity! 
Never gonna be tired of winning but winning before we've even started... well, that's just ridiculous.
Donald Trump plays 3d chess. Jill Stein Hates Hillary Clinton. The unions are powerful in Wisconsin. The unions have been known to stuff ballot boxes.
My theory: Stein is actually HELPING Trump. Recount the ballots, find a huge number of illegal votes for Hillary, say 5 to 10 percent, multiply that by the rest of the country. BOOM, there goes Hillary's so called popular vote. The best part, the liberals pay to expose the cheating.
Maybe Jill Stein is playing 10D chess to expose Dem fraud!?!  I so hope that Trump's lead expands in these recounts to show people how rigged it is...
If you recount, you will find all the votes that liberals didn't count in favour of President Elect Trump because "feelings".
Funny how the pre-election "recount" meme from the left was "there has never been proof of voter fraud...." and now it's all about voter fraud. 
What is the point of recounting Wisconsin?  Even if Trump lost Wisconsin he still has enough electoral votes to be president.  Why waste the time or money?  I am curious the REAL reason for this distraction.  Is it to get Jill Stein some money?  Put our focus on Wisconsin to distract us from something else?  
[removed]
Eh she's not particularly good at that either 
But who's still giving her money? I mean after losing the 2nd or 3rd time don't you just realize people don't like her. 
Why is it always ugly white women?

Umm, when did it become ok to kill people because you may have been bullied.  Remember when the thinking behind Columbine was that the two perpetrators were in the wrong.  I guess they should have waited a few years and they could have been heroes to the liberal left...except they were both white...maybe That was the real problem all along.

What's up with PA recount? I'm not worried about votes, the only mass cheating was from Clinton but I think their plan is to file at the last hour, sue in courts, delay the vote past the deadline, eliminating Pa Mi Wi electoral votes. 
I SEE GEORGE SOROS!

Does anyone want to tell /r/Quotesporn that Hillary's campaign manager ordered the assassination of Scalia, and did it through his email account?
I wish they would retire the tactic of using a statement by someone they hate to indict Trump. When people think for themselves, they often disagree even with their own political allies. If Scalia were alive, he and Trump could discuss the issue. 

If jeb or any other Bush says something I can already tell you nobody here gives a fuck. 
Post new findings, I believe there is still lots to learn concerning The Clintons and their foreign backdoor dealings.

If all you did was watch CNN during this election, you'd think there wasn't a soul in the country that liked Mr. Trump one bit.  And then the American people voted this man into the presidency in an electoral LANDSLIDE.  Just goes to show you how out of touch the MSM really is.

GOD CNN pissed me off so bad today. It's on in the breakroom at work and I walked in to see the news about the OSU incident. CNN's BREAKING NEWS banner was still calling it a shooting incident and said nothing about the perpetrator except that he was a student at the school and identity still unknown (no race, religion, etc).. immediately got on my phone and whaddya know, pretty much everyone else is already reporting it as a knife/car attack, name, Islam, Somali refugee, screenshots of Facebook posts with complaints about the US treatment of Muslims, photos of him. 

Poor CNN desperately trying to hold onto the hope that a white middle class student gunned down his classmates, unfuckinbelievable.

#DAVE FUCKIN' RUBIN TAKIN' IT HOME.

This is my idea of a liberal.

Dave. Fucking. Rubin.
The mental gymnastics it take to be a good little liberal is mind boggling.
Perhaps he's not uninformed, maybe he just supports the attacker?

Thank goodness these morons weren't successful in the election.


He means the senseless act of gun violence committed by the cop who viciously killed the passionate protestor standing up for his right to have a dedicated place to pray on campus.
Hey, everyone, that could have been your next, next President.

Ill Hillary had been elected, then jailed or sent to hospital, the fool Kaine would have been in charge.

Pence has sense, Kaine is insane.


This is just further evidence that liberals like Tim Kaine just blindly throw out the term "gun violence" in hopes of surpressing the 2nd Amendment.
"A cop shot a brown person, I don't need anymore info" -SJWs 
I'm ashamed he's my senator but I'm overjoyed he's not my VP Elect.
Wait, did he blatantly just assume the attack was with a gun? FUCKING FAIL
He was concerned about the peaceful demonstrator who was fatally shot for expressing his beliefs
LOL **#NotAnyOnesVicePRESIDENT**
We need more liberals like Dave Rubin. I disagree with several things he wants/likes/agrees with. However, he is ACTUALLY trying to have a reasonable discussion.

I wonder when the Jesuits decided that embracing Islam was a good idea.  I never trusted that order. 
What sort of inbred retard must Kaine be to arrive at such a backwards conclusion. 
Dave Rubin went from democrat to libertarian in less than a year and we all watched it happen.

Some bullshit on creepy Tim. Jumping to a point without the facts.  
Didbn't even take the time to fully understand the issue before plugging his agenda? Sounds about right.

Tim Kaine probably wears footy pajamas.
Wait, *what*?! Mr. Kaine is praying for the "victim" of the gun violence? You mean the guy that ran over and stabbed several people? But not the victims of the terrorist? This goes beyond a difference in opinion, this is straight ignorance and idiocy.
If thats not BTFO then nothing is
Dave Rubin is the kind of pundit we need speaking up on the Democrat side.  Can you imagine two parties that are able to make sensible arguments?

I could see Tim Kaine dressing as a clown and luring kids into the back of his van.  Just saying.

He jumped the gun there folks.

My boy Rubin!  Can we get him a coat?
What a dipshit. Take your dicklips back to the hole you were found in and stay away from my kids or I will shoot you. 
Wait, what the fuck? He didn't actually tweet that.... right?? Is he talking about something else? What am I missing here for that to be his ACTUAL view???
Can you believe this dildo had a serious shot at becoming the VP of the United States of America? Holy shit...
senator??? that pedo is not fit to be a janitor. 
What the actual hell!?!
Is it so hard to wait until the facts are out before making a statement? Or is he really tweeting against the cop lol
These people really hate guns and just revolve the narrative around banning guns
I was actually fooled by the media when it said Ohio State shooting. Wow. 
Just think about how close this bozo was to the White House, Jesus Christ
Kaine was vetted by Soros and was meant to assume the Presidency when Clinton keeled over in her first 90 days.  Yeah we dodged a bullet.
HOLY CABOLEY

This can't be true... can it? Or am I just taking crazy pills
What a fucking moron
The guy is a complete moron...
It feels like this tweet had an underlying tone of using this tragedy to push for more gun control IMO. He was probably hoping for a white "shooter" as well. Lame Timmy. 
Maybe this will lead to the ban of automobiles. I'm so ready to go back to riding horses!

#HOW DOW WE SPIN THIS?????????????????
What a fucking asshole. Goes straight to playing politics making it a gun issue. This is why people hate liberals and they lost. They make EVERYTHING political and try to sneak it in as much as possible. 

The guy was Muslim. From a dangerous Muslim nation that praises radical Islamic terror. These are all topics Trump that actually prove Trumps points and he very well could have brought up EASILY but he didn't. All Trump did was give out positive thoughts and encouragement to the people who stopped the killing and those effected by it. 
Fuck Yeah Rubin! I forgot about that guy. I always thought he was the most sensible liberal. Great interviewer too.
Is this guy as dumb as he looks or what?


As a Virginian, I just want to apologize for this guy. For real. Sorry. 
Right, stopping a madman's attempt to kill innocent people with a gun is "senseless."

Go fuck yourself Kreepy Kaine!
He spoke too soon.
One of the more underrated Trump jokes was when he openly pondered whether Hillary should replace Kaine after he was chosen.
ohhhh Timmy!!!! he's so silly!!!
He's dumber that Al Gore! 
What is with liberals and not waiting till the evidence comes out?
In the words of a wise craftsmen: "Don't think so, Tim."

(Am I really the first to think of this?)
And the Dems wonder why they can't win an election
Did he actually say that?
Creepy Cuck Kaine is actually more of a threat to America than Smashin n Bashin Hillary.
Oh Boy, we dodged a bullet with this clown Kane. Imagine if he was a heartbeat away.
**BTFO KAINE**
Gun control helped this terrorist. He was in a gun Free zone
This tweet confirmed what we all knew--this guy is a first class clown.
Based gay liberal 
damn Kaine is a fucking moron did he just assume  it was a guy with a gun killing random people in a active shooter type situation? Does he even research anything (he doesn't).
Is this real!?

Fuck you Tim Kaine!
I think it's great that Virginia elects the slow, dimwit type. They deserve a chance too. I live in Washington state where we have a governor that's the same dull knife from a different drawer.

I love Dave Rubin's YouTube channel.  Even though I think he was favoring the Libertarian party in this election.  He really believes in freedom.
Wow Dave is learning how to stump. Keep it up!
Kaine is still drunk from the humiliating loss a few weeks back. 
What. The. Fuck.

I can't tell if that is satire.. is he serious? 
What a loser!
Can they fucking not? 
Dave Rubin doing it made it twice as much winning.
Based Rubin. 
How stupid does one have to be to issue that tweet. It's like the guy (or his handler) didn't even read any of the details.
Reasonable liberals stumping brainless liberals.
Dave Rubin is a great example of what a liberal should be. I used to think the same thing about Harris, but he shilled hard for Hillary while ignoring all of her flaws. 
Liberals once again praying for gun violence so they can climb up on their stump. "It does not matter to them that a car and knife were used to commit more terrorism by a radical muslim let's blame guns." -libtard logic
Wow, how do you become so disconnected with reality? Such low energy! 
Like drunks in a bar, they swing and they miss.
To be fair (and [to play Devil's Advocate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74oGgFTgpI4)), early reports on the situation covered it as an 'active shooter situation' until more facts got out. I could see Kaine addressing it, then the story being updated resulting in him looking stupid. Not that he needs help with that.

That's just my two cents.
He talks about his prediction at around the 1:50 mark
Flynn was essentially forced into retirement for refusing to accept that ISIS is not in fact a JV team.

It seems quite obvious that all brass who refused to be political pawns were quickly discarded.
Have you seen his interview with Mehdi Hasan where he talks about the origins of ISIS? Really great stuff.

I remember that when they first popped up I wanted to downvote their crap, but then I realised they were just giving us more publicity, so upvotes galore it was, and suddenly there was twice the amount of Trump spam on the front page.

Seriously, any sane person with an IQ above 70 would understand that calling for gun control after an incident where NO gun was involved doesn't make sense.      

These are zombies, they hear the words "terrorist attack" so they play their *we need more gun control* mental tape, even if no guns were used. It's not funny. It's pretty creepy.
She's definitely a one Watt bulb.
We need to swing back.


Anyone calling for gun control clearly is against the cop who stopped this terrorist. They clearly sided with the terrorist.

Because he only gun used here was to fucking stop him
It's called "simulacra simulation ", and that's how the media  and soros brainwash.   A simple way to understand it is photo shopping a movie star.  Take 2 photos of the same movie star or singer.  One photo will be naturally realistic, the other next to it, will be photo shopped or air brushed.  As long as media continues to show the photo shopped air brushed version(both are truth and true pictures) people will refuse the natural reality that a star or singer is not pretty or god/goddess looking.  With guns it's the same way,  all pictures and stories are of guns in negative ways.  Therfore many people refuse to see  them for any good. People are so wrapped up in a TV that it is their god, and can't see the reality around them.  
  I have a funny feeling that this was a planned false flag and it went real, but media is going to stick to the talking points regardless of the "reality" of the truth.   Simulacra simulation  doesn't hide the "truth" it hides the "natural reality of the truth!"
  Truth...legally  trained, licensed cop, has a gun shoots criminal. Doing his job fighting crime and saving lives.
Simulacra simulation....someone had a gun, some bullets  from a gun where fired,someone got shot, someone died, all guns are bad.
  Both true but reality is....if it wasn't  for cop being there to stop others from being hurt, more innocent  people would of died.  The cop had no  choice but to use lethal force.
  If one could snap others back to reality then you would stop the brainwashing.
She is right! Our gun laws ARE too lax.  EVERY American should be REQUIRED to carry a gun!
Time to ban knives.
Soros should be brought to trail and all of the fake organizations supported by his money should be shut down.
Even if he used a gun it would have been illegally owned. He was not allowed to own a gun due to his residency status. 
I personally used to say shit like this.  Shame on me.
Old people are not your allies. They're degenerates who gave rise to the modern left. They also created systems that will only benefit them, like Social Security.

NY Times and 270 to win finally made MI solid red. Its about damn time.
This is honestly crazy, I was actually sitting next to my TV with my wife as the kids slept waiting for Clinton to win. Then Trump pulls away, I am like "what?" Then I realize California and other big states haven't counted their votes yet, and these are big Liberal states. So when that time came I sat there "Ok this is where it starts boosting Hillary." Very close, but she still did not match him. Then Trump pulls away to 270 and I am in shock. Now I sit here and look at the finals after Michigan comes in and I am here thinking to myself "Not only did Trump win, but it was literally a fucking landslide." 

Now every time I look at this picture I just stare at it. I stare because what I thought was impossible actually happened. It's honestly the craziest thing I have seen, with all the media pounding on Trump I swore he was losing the election. Especially after the whole women sexual harassment debacle came into play. I just knew it was going to go downhill. It didn't, and now we kicked one of the most corrupt politicians out of the WH who was literally spoon-fed every advantage physically possible, on top of experience and working with a president who is very popular publicly. 

I just have no words to express how I feel. I am happy because it isn't Clinton and I feel hopeful, but I am still unsure how he will handle being president.

She doesn't know anything about U.S. politics except she really wanted a woman President. Dual citizens apparently can legally vote in the U.S. Even if they don't live in the country, etc. The CNN article is about Mexican dual citizens.

http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/26/world/americas/mexican-american-dual-nationals-voting/index.html

I NEVER would have thought my aunt could vote in the U.S. She can barely speak English. I have no idea how she ended up with dual citizenship, her husband is French.
All American citizens can vote as long as they do not have a felony record and they are 18 years of age. If they have to pay taxes, they have a right to a say in government. 
I thought if you were living in another country for a certain time you are automatically a resident of that country and therefore expatriated

Just answering their questions and showing respect to them got them to thank me for not being a prick like most students apparently are.

The fucking liberals are already complaining that it was a white cop that killed the black guy.  Can't make this shit up.
There are people i know personally saying that the Somalis are the real victims here because of the "backlash" they will face. I cant honestly believe that this is what it has come to. People were almost killed today. Innocent people. And I am supposed to feel sorry for the violent fucks that caused it? Why is good bad and bad good? Why is up down and down up? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON

Hell yeah baud. Keep these Muslim refugees in check. We're not safe as a nation until we start monitoring and screening these people being let in by our graciousness.
The more we celebrate heroes like this the more they will feel appreciated by the citizens of this great country and the prouder people will feel about their country!

He is hero for being there on time before there's a death. One thing that bothers me is if the attacker only has a machete and haven't killed anybody, could the attacker be subdued alive?  We could gather intel out of him, find out what driven him to do such a violent act.

It reminds me of when Osama Bin Laden was killed right on spot. I think he was watching television and got blindsided. All valuable information are gone forever.

"A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague." - Marcus Tullius Cicero

Mr. Horujko stopped it all in under a minute. In the end only a few college students got shaked up but none of them needs "special counseling" and "pizza therapies" like SJWs with Trump. I mean really a Somali terrorist almost kills you at OSU. You suck it up and move on with life- only a little bit on edge but you're fine. Then you're a SJW at Harvard. Trump get's elected.

But I don't blame them. It's the media that put that picture in their heads."

I'd like to see what the people are downvoting this hero give as a reason for doing so. 
In France, a terrorist attacks and kills 100 people and wounds 200 more.

In Ohio, a terrorist uses similar tactics and he is the only one killed. The Buckeyes should be proud that they gave as well as they got.

Only in America is the only person killed in a terrorist attack at a school the terrorist.

The Ohio State Buckeyes have a new motto: "Go ahead, make my day."

The Ohio State Buckeyes have a new hymn: "What we have here is a failure to communicate. Some people you just can't reach, so we get what we had here Monday. I don't like it any more than you do, but that's the way he wants it so that's the way he gets it."
What happened? Why is this no longer front page? 
I saw someone trying to defend the attacker and make the officer look like a racist killer. I proceed to ask them what they would do if a armed man came at them full force with intent to kill you. They had the dumbest look on their face trying to answer.

**YOU'RE WINNER OFC. HORUJKO**

That news conference was extremely cringeworthy. The officer did a heroic task but every government official available is taking credit for it when most of them probably support Black Lives Matter much more than they do Blue Lives Matter.

Heroic. Had to assume guns and even explosives possibly multiple attackers. Didn't flinch, took threat down in under a minute.

We have seen in Israel how bad these lone wolf killing sprees can get. Even just with knives.
God Bless.  

Best wishes for those who were shot.

Wait was it terrorism?
President Trump should award him the Medal of Freedom.
**HES A WHITE MALE!!!**

On a serious note though, this guy is a hero and deserves a medal!
Can someone fill me in, all I know is that some crazy person drove through a bunch of people. I don't know about motive, ethnicity, religion, age, gender or anything.
An evil cis white male who oppressed the immigrant muslim freedom fighting hero who was trying to make a statement about the alt right. 
Congrats to him for stopping a possible massacre!


Of course, white male killed a poor black refugee.  Those white males... bunch of Islamophobes and racists. 
Best headline so far from the Columbus Dispatch:

"Ohio State Attack:Police Identify Suspect as Business Student"

Just as I first suspected! Those damn murderous business students! We need to deport all business students!

I'm glad the Columbus Dispatch gave me the most important and relevant description of this heinous attacker. 
We can not rest until [Sam Hyde](https://twitter.com/MisterMetokur/status/803279059983679489) is brought to justice. 
He's a youngin
Maybe these white males aren't all bad

Honestly killing, even when justified, is still traumatizing.  I hope he's okay.
What is the background of the last name Horujko? That is an unusual one. Hungarian?
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. WHITE OR BLACK. None of that shit matters, this man is a patriot. A True home grown saver of American lives. I salute him at full mast. Thank you, sir.


Thank you, Patriot!  We are all in your debt!
Let's be sensitive to this brave hero. He had to shoot a human being today and might not feel as jovial as us. 
He gets a buckeye leaf on his badge for sure. 
We are all Brutus !
How the fuck does someone downvote this? There must be a shit ton of bots going ham against r/The_Donald.

You did a great thing patriot. Many lives and limbs were saved because of your action.

White looking man shot a MUSLIM!!!! WHAT A RACIST!! REEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
This is the hero who stopped the **RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM** attack today at Ohio State

FTFY
r/news started banning users for "Islamophobia".

It's the same practice they employed for the Orlando terrorist attack, but they delayed it to decrease visibility.

Also, check the upvotes / downvotes - someone reported that votes went from +70 in that thread to +6 in a matter of minutes.
This dude crashed his car into pedestrians, got out of the car and slashed several more with a knife then refused to put it down when the officer asked him. Deserving of his exit from this planet.

That was the time he had to decide to shoot or not shoot the raghead.

Wtf is wrong with people? Some redditors are so loyal to their agenda they will defend terrorists and pedos to protect it. Sad!
No I'm genuinely wondering why a university had a police officer stationed there in the first place. I mean its a university. That isn't somewhere I'd expect the police to be stationed.

Is it normal to have police on campus in America?

I'm honestly not trying to troll.
All downvoters are terrorist sympathizing scum.
We need more cops like this guy. Quick to action, saves lives.
Wow, this is racism of Trump's America. White man in power shoots a black Muslim immigrant student. Fucking unbelievable.

What the fuck? Why did this white male kill a refugee who just wanted to spread his culture!?
We don't like to have to use our weapons, but when we do, we make that 99 cent bullet count!

Excellent work sir, excellent. It's never easy to kill a human (unless you're Moslime) but you saved a lot of truly innocent lives today!

Liberals: he's a racist white male and a police officer. How dare he interfere with the rights of a refugee to kill whoever he wants on a college campus.
SLM? (somali lives matter)
By the nature of the attack, it's considered a terrorist stack. But do we know if it is considered an extremist Islam terrorist attack?
This terrorist attack was a cuck liberals worst nightmare....it was committed by a minority Muslim with no gun. In there world this is impossible.
FUCKING WHITE MALE.  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Police "medals" always crack me up as there seems to be no standard and the organizations are so small it's like what's the meaning to anyone else... But this guy deserves a medal.
WOOO!
I was not awake when news of this broke. At the dinner table a mass shooting was brought up in Ohio and my family thought that innocents died. I was so happy when I learned that wasn't the case. It's just so great that the campus police were able to perserve the lives of the the wonderful men and women who attend OSU.
Another ribbon on the right side of his uniform will be well deserved.

A Somali man charged into a Columbus, Ohio, restaurant on Thursday evening and immediately began attacking innocent patrons with a machete, according to reports.

‚ÄúFour people were injured in the brutal attack Thursday evening at Nazareth Restaurant and Deli, a Mediterranean restaurant in Columbus. The victims were taken to an area hospital and were expected to recover,‚Äù CBS reports.

‚ÄúPolice identified the suspected attacker as Mohamed Barry, 30, who has a Somali background, and officials believe he may have traveled to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in 2012.‚Äù

Well done, officer. Well done. 
60% Just goes to show how low liberals can go. Sickening
Thinking back to the morning of 9/11 it's really sad that these terror attacks have become part of the regular humdrum of western life.
Oh gosh, he's going to get lynched by the left. If the victim is black, I can't even imagine..
That was his face when he noticed the guy brought a knife to a gun fight.
It's a bull market for tendies lately. 
Saved a lot of money for the taxpayers of the great state of Ohio, with a few dollars worth of bullets. Job well done!

Until then...praise our hero!

so kinda like i like this thing when i use it......but now that it used against me its wrong unfair ect. im i on the right track?

one thing the election has taught me is the Left is TERRIBLE at losing. the is no grace or dignity here. trump won the way ALL elections have for the history of the US.....but he lost a irrelevant number that both candidates weren't even fighting for otherwise trump would have been campaigning in california.

its like saying you won a car 50 lap marathon race because you won the fastest lap, but not the ACTUAL race. im from the uk so im not 100% clear on everything that's just my take : )
The Left LOVES consolidating power in the federal government...

Just wait until things like Flag Burning is turned into Hate Speech, BLM is classified as a domestic terrorist group, and the 'settled science' that gender dimorphism is a mental disorder.

This doesn't even start with all the fed pressure that can be applied to the cities and individuals harboring illegal aliens.  Live by expanding federal power, die by expanded federal power.

What happened to her? She was a HUGE BLM supporter just a year ago. Happy to see she's trying to MAGA, but she did a big flip, she must have seen how radically bigoted they are and a light flipped in her head. Liked her before she went wayyyy left but happy to see she made it full circle.

Even if I didn't agree with a thing the man said, the fact that he pissed off the media, the Dems, the GOP, and regressive leftist douchebags everywhere means he is doing something right.
I'm going to actually have to start using twitter for something now instead of just shit posting.
Don't trust Cassandra Fairbanks. She associates with BLM. 
Yes it is Pede! Thanks for sharing! MAGA
CNN: "Trump wastes time on Twitter bashing the recount effort. Can we really trust him with the responsibility of running this country?"

This George Soros 60 Minutes interview was scrubbed from the internet. It has been FOUND!
Yep... that's about right. Much like the trump statue with a small penis... that's art. But the old fat Hillary statue was offensive and sexist
I'm an atheist but I respect christian values and traditions. I don't get why so many atheist shit on christianity, many of my friends are christians and they're the most caring people I know.

He's unhinged.  There is no exterior influence to his thought process.

Tucker just said "prepare your sack of beer cans to be thrown at the television."  I love this guy, wonder who he is going to destroy next
She's the opposite of legit.
My argument is that Michigan uses paper ballots, and Ohio uses machines.

If this is about the machines being hacked why ask for recounts in Michigan but not Ohio? Simple: she lost Ohio by 10 points, but in Michigan only by 0.5 points.

Or the fact that isis uses twitter but they care more about banning gay conservatives. 
It's the same reason our government has been selling the country out bit by bit to foreign interests.

The next 4 years is going to be a complete mind fuck for liberals. 

>Holy fuck we should burn the flag!!!!

>No that's what he wants you to do, don't burn the flag!!!

> Wait maybe he knows that we know that we are being baited and we should really burn the confederate flag

Trump: why do you guys keep burning shit?  Thought you cared about the environment. 

Liberals:REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE




Seeing liberals lose their minds about flag burning got me thinking.

They hated the confederate flag and and the confederacy etc, but I never saw them burning it.  They just want it removed it from society.  Now that it is gone they burn and disgrace the flag that freed the slaves and destroyed the confederacy.  I don't get it.  I think it has something to do with the confederacy being all democrats and they want to protect their own flag.

Otherwise, she takes shots.
This is how she would have run the country. And then acted like it's the brewer's fault.

Don't worry, CNN is on line 2 for you so you too can get humiliated on your own show.  America is great.

He needs to resign. He has completely shattered the integrity of the entire site. Not only do we need to Make America Great Again, we need to make **Reddit** great again!
Resign u/spez

spez: u/spez is the best leader!

#pizzagate "fake news" yeah. okay. believe what you want cbs....
We must do with him what we did with the last ceo
Wait, where the hell is his apology?

He should have posted it here if he actually wants to apologize. 
Hillary Clinton also gave a bunch of useless apologies. At this point, what does it even matter?
The man just shit all over the place he eats...dumb fucking move.  Didn't he read Trumps book?  Liberals make awful CEOS (grubhub, Pepsi, HP, yahoo) they just can't help themselves.
Not even remotely an apology, do not forget how he signed his admission, the equivalent of "Fuck you, Spez".  The same way that a normal person would write, "Take care, Me", or "Best wishes, Me"....he signed his "Fuck you, Spez".  Not an apology CBS, don't become a fake news outlet...
False. There has been no apology. Just look at /u/spez's comment history. He didn't apologize when it happened. He hasn't apologized since. 
I don't even remember him apologizing. All I remember seeing was "I probably shouldn't have done that, it's fixed now." 
I am curious why the obvious fake Irises on Steve Huffmans photo.

is it just a red-eye correction or something else. somebody either didn't care how fake the photo looks, or they wanted this effect.

the person in this photo does not look 'human' in the accepted sense. CGI !?

There is a video on Fox right now that talks about u/spez changing posts and how he had fun doing it.  It also says that there is no real proof about Pizzagate.

No mention of the leaked admin chat in that article..SMH
Step down, cuck /u/spez
Spez, what a shit biscuit.
He can apologize by fuckin right off!!
Empty words. 
Can someone please tell me how to get reddit to stop filtering /all? I can see the_donald posts for a split second and then they all disappear it first started with just the front page so I'd click /all and then it would be fine it would show me all the top posts. Now I get the filtering?
Fuck this pedophile 
Apology not accepted.

Bend the knee and resign you little bitch
His pr stunt "apology" is further insult to the 99% of eddit users at risk of having their voices silenced, comments modified, or other bullshit for not echoing the liberal madness spewed forth from the obscene pieholes of despicable man children.  Fuck u/spez.
so when is he stepping down?
[removed]
I say support him. He's wrong, but he's protecting us now. 
Jesus Christ...
I really wish I could say I was surprised.  At least most of the comments are condemning the headline, not praising it.
Think Progress is a "sister advocacy organization" to Podesta's Center for American Progress. Soros is behind it, as is David Brock's Media Matters.

Muslims have nothing to do with terrorism? 

Okay guy. Just a pure coincidence that they all happen to be Muslim.
This is good.  We will know who and where they are when it's time to start deporting.

I'm going to let them grieve because that terrorist was a personal friend of theirs, but I'm going to keep an eye on them and monitor their communications

**PRAISE THEM BOYS IN BLUE**
As someone who lives in Columbus I can tell you Somali refugees in Columbus are a huge problem. Columbus has the highest amount in the country per capta. 

The problem isn't all but the radical one. Here's a few examples of problems they have caused before today in Columbus.
1. They still practice female circumcisions. They do this to their daughters between the age of 13-16 in their homes. Once they have done this they call an ambulance to save their daughters lives. This has caused the hospitals and suburbs of Columbus millions of dollars for training to save these poor girls.
2. In some school districts they have demanded their kids are taught by only male teachers. The district had to go out and pay extra money to hire a male Muslim teacher to come in on Saturdays to educate their kids. 
3. The neighborhoods they have moved into have high crime rates. (There are other neighborhoods within in a mile that don't have these same problems.
You're a college student, you don't like police, did you forget your homework already?  /s

This forum has been saying it for a year now. Islamic terror is not some random event, its a way of life for a lot of these Islamists.
Out here people were acting like Trump was batshit insane for suggesting that perhaps *more* armed officers/security on campuses could save lives.
As a Michigan fan...I'm glad you're safe and commend our boys in blue for stopping the TERRORIST threat. Hopefully everyone comes out of it OK. God Bless you Buckeyes, geez never thought I'd say that lol

I wish I had police officers like that!

Finally something i can really agree with you guys about! That was great work from that officer.
Glad that useless, selfish, worthless fuck was shot dead before he tried to murder anyone else. 

The fact he was a Somali Refugee makes it worse because the MSM will be defending him. If he was a white conservative, they'd demonize the shit out of him non stop for the next 2 weeks.

Who the fuck downvotes this? 
Can someone direct me to where in the news it was mentioned this was a Somali refugee? The news articles I've found so far only state that no information has been released yet about the attacker.

The University Police deserve commendation for their quick and decisive action in this attack.
Should have pulled a Bernie and handed them their guns and equipment and stood there silently.
It will only get more efficient under Trump. MAGA!

Let you smoke weed on the porch of your trap house, partake in keg stands, merc terrorists in the blink of an eye. OSU cops are undoubtedly based. 
 .... aaaand he's a young male Muslim!
Contrast that to the 2013 attack in London (big gun "safe space") on a soldier in broad daylight where it took armed officers 14 minutes to arrive on the scene.

Great response time and glad that nothing worse occurred!
Ohio was always a MAGA state no matter how hard that cuck Kasich tried to hold it back.
amen to that!

if this happened at Berkeley there'd be a pile of corpses and the cops would still be trying to get the killer to express his feelings!
A good guy with a gun could prevent a terrorist from harming more people? Who would've known.
Of course Reddit would downvote the hell out of this.
I like how this post is just to show support for the hero cop and has nothing to do with Trump, yet people are still down-voting simply because it's on our sub.  Disgusting
As a democratic socialist who hates everything this sub stands for:

The craziest part is that this isn't even the first Somalian to go crazy and hack people up with a knife in Columbus this year! A family friend of a friend owns a restaurant in town called the Cafe Nazareth. Apparently this offended  a Somalian man so much he went inside and asked for the owner, then started slashing people with a machete. 2 Somalian knife terror attacks in the same city in one year. What are the fucking odds?

Wow one min. A FINE SHOT 
As someone who was born in Ohio and a lifelong Buckeyes fan this act really pissed me off (as all acts of terrorism on our soil do but you know what I mean).  Good to know these officers were on top of their game and were able to neutralize the piece of filth before any further damage could be done.

I like to imagine it was like in Indiana Jones where the Somali takes out this bladed weapon to fight the cop in hand to hand, and the cop just shrugs and shoots the guy. 
Michigan supports you
Originally from Ohio, have quite a few friends at OSU. Thank you high energy PD for stopping this threat! Under Trump, these events should happen less and less every year. 
wow i did not know this. mad respect for them this is the type of bravery and selflessness we need in this country

Everyone hates cops until some dude starts hacking up people. 
I definitely didn't vote for Donald Trump, but I just upvoted this. So thankful for that police officer's quick actions. I have many friends at OSU that could have been hurt by this terrorist. 

We almost had an attack over at NKU last year, although it was mental health related rather than terrorist related. Our awesome police officers also arrived within a minute and a half and disarmed the girl with the loaded gun in the library.

So thankful for all of the police officers putting themselves in danger daily to protect us.
We have the best campus police, don't we folks?
hell yeah, why are we still discussing the idea of bringing in refugees?

A Somali man charged into a Columbus, Ohio, restaurant on Thursday evening and immediately began attacking innocent patrons with a machete, according to reports.

‚ÄúPolice identified the suspected attacker as Mohamed Barry, 30, who has a Somali background, and officials believe he may have traveled to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in 2012.‚Äù

Guns kill bad ppl 
Is anyone else suspicious of this at all?? I've heard so many different versions of the story. How is it that he hit people with his car, chased down people with a knife, and was also labeled a gunman all in a matter of 60 seconds. 
You people dont understand. He was being desperate because of oppression, discrimination and our institutional racism, and that's why he carried out this act. It's 2016 stop this nonsense with countries and borders -we are all humans and we need open border society.

They took the bait.
Conspiracy: Trump is profiting from all these flags being sold and using the funds to help build the wall basically having them pay for what they are protesting.
Imagine that!
Let's petition to have them all locked up for a year or lose their citizenship. 
Googled their shirts and found revcom.us. They're communists. Pick any communist country and see what happens when you burn their flag.
Dude said crazy shit nonstop for over a decade. No one batted an eye. 

Goes after the establishment and is immediately hospitalized against his will.

Sounds about right. 
Gonna weigh in with some insight on this. 

Kanye was originally involuntarily hospitalized under California Section 5150, a law which allows any police officer or nurse to hospitalize anyone they suspect of being crazy. There doesn't need to be any evidence of criminal behavior. 

Section 5150 gives the hospital 72 hours for a psychiatrist and the medical staff to evaluate you. Note that in California psych wards cannot confirm or deny whether a patient is in their care, so all the reports of "exhaustion" are coming from Kanye's publicist who doesn't have an obligation to tell the truth. 

After the 72 hours the hold can be extended again by 14 days under Section 5250. This is the hold Kanye is on now. A 5250 hold can only be recommended by a psychiatrist that has examined and diagnosed the patient. It requires both: 1) a diagnosed mental disorder and 2) an intent to harm. Both components are necessary. If the patient has a mental disorder but wants to be released and has people who can take care of them than the patient must be released. Wanting to fuck somebody up is also not a mental disorder in itself by itself and not a reason to continue holding a patient against their will either. 

During the 14 day period the patient can appeal for a probable cause hearing for the court to determine if their initial hospitalization was done legally. 

After the 14 day hold the hold can be extended again by another 30 days under Section 5270. During the 30 day hold the patient can file a writ of habeus corpus and appear before the court for a hearing on their mental competency. 

After the 30 day hold the patient can only continue to be hospitalized against their will if they are placed in a "temporary conservatorship" by the state which essentially strips them of their rights completely and puts decision making power in the hands of someone else, which would likely be Kanye's wife Kim. 

The fact that Kanye is already on a 5250 hold is a VERY BAD SIGN. It means he's already been diagnosed with a mental disorder by a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist is probably unlikely to change that diagnosis during the next 40 days. 

I've been on a 5150 hold 4 times, because like I said any cop in California can put you on for any reason including "I don't like you" but I've always gotten out well under the 72 hour mark. Because I've never actually been diagnosed with a mental disorder.  I also guarantee the circumstances he got brought to the hospital were far less crazy seeming than mine. 

Everyone I've ever seen get put on a 5250 hold from the inside of a psych ward has been completely non-functioning insane. Like hallucinating giant crabs in the hallways or believing they are literally God crazy. Or attempting suicide while in the psych ward. 

I don't know how the fuck they're honestly holding Kanye at this point. Kanye is clearly not paranoid schizophrenic because that diagnosis requires months of behavior as well as the presence of hallucinations or disorganized speech (or non-narcissistic delusions) which Kanye clearly doesn't have. AFAIK a diagnosis of a group A personality disorder like paranoid personality disorder does not warrant by itself an involuntary hospitalization, there needs to be a more severe co-morbid problem. 

Kanye's revealed in his music he has a lexapro subscription but he hasn't at all appeared suicidal, only suicidal depression merits involuntary hospitalization (actually involuntary hospitalization is a very ineffective method of treating non-suicidal depression) and Kanye hasn't for a moment appeared suicidal. 

It's possible Kanye is bipolar, I've suspected this in the past from listening to his music, although bipolar patients generally only get hospitalized during a manic episode and mania does not correspond with the cover of "exhaustion" that's been given at all. 

Also please note what the diagnosis of mental DISORDER is. A mental disorder significantly impacts a patients ability to work. There's an adage that rich people are called eccentric and poor people are called crazy, that's sort of true. But the real basis is that abnormal behavior by itself is not evidence of a mental disorder ESPECIALLY IF THE PATIENT IS PROFITING TO THE TUNE OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THAT BEHAVIOR. All considerations of the patients life needs to be considered and if the patient is consistently operating at an incredible level of success across multiple fields its very hard to diagnose a mental disorder. The "disorder" part is key, psychiatry is not meant to be a judgment of lifestyles or personality, it's for sick people who need medicine to live a normal life. 
Has there been no news about him since he was handcuffed and taken away?
This needs more coverage.  Too much of a "coincidence" that he "becomes ill" immediately after he comes out in favor of Trump and speaking out against Obama and the Establishment.  And now the rest of his tour is cancelled.  I bet 99.8%+ chance he has been threatened.  The Illuminati elites that control the music industry are sending Kanye a message.  
Correct... he left the plantation and the plantation went after him immediately. 
This is Soviet level shit. 
*I'm* dead.
~~psych ward~~ reprogramming centre
I...I didn't realize this was true.  Holy fuck.  
His fellow elites were afraid that he was going to start talking about the international pedo ring.
I'm begging you! Don't go to /r/[Kanye'sBiggestSub] and support Kanye! 

I was attacked, harassed, and then banned for supporting Kanye. I don't want that to happen to any of you guys.  

They are in complete denial that anything he said was rational. Everyone there will only allow talk that "Kanye is mentally ill." 

"what he said was crazy, he needs help. He was mentally ill." "Instead of making fun of a mentally ill person's comments we need to support him getting the help he needs." "Let's all pray for Kanye. He needs medical help now."

It's not true support it's denial that Kanye believes or said something against their own beliefs. 

Liberals aren't used to musicians disagreeing with them. When they do they don't know how to handle it. 
They're giving him electroshock therapy. He's going to be a vegetable when he gets back.
They put him in a hospital for sleep deprivation. HE GOT CAUGHT BEING TOO WOKE
#FREEKANYE
He's being brainwashed as we speak, poor Kanye. 
i'm sure it was Jay-z who put him in there. Jay-z is literally the HRC of the hip hop world. Not to mention that he's buddy buddy with her 
"As we reported, Kanye has had a rough time at UCLA Medical Center, struggling with extreme paranoia -- at one point he would not even let the doctors touch him."

No fucking shit. He was kidnapped against his will and thrown in a mental hospital. I would be paranoid as fuck too. 
He was losing his mind for many years but no one cared. The moment he touched the power structure he was forcibly hospitalized. I'm pretty sure he will come out feeling completely dead inside from all the drugs and procedures. 
Protective custody from clinton,  soros,  podesta
Ye been on that Trump shit since **MBDTF**

Baby your fired, your girlfriend hired  
But if you don't mind I'ma keep you on call  
We above the law, we don't give a fuck bout y'all."  
What if Kim's robbery had something to do with him coming out and saying something?

Maybe Kim was planning on redpilling people, and the elite gave a warning. When she didn't abide, they displayed how close they can get. 

Naturally, this would piss off any uncucked husband. Hence Kanye coming out and fighting back.

Spez: What IF Kim's robbery....
 I thought I was crazy for thinking this. Dude leaves the good little black guy plantation and immediately gets admitted to a psych ward.
When Kesha came out against being molested by a producer (will not say his name), her career went down in a shit storm of flames. There is some serious forces working within the entertainment industry. 
Dont like thw guy or his music but ill be buying his next albulm if he talks about this shit in it.
They had to send him back for reprogramming.
What can we do to help? Are visitors allowed in at the psych ward (I doubt it)? Should we tweet to Kim?

Nice framing. I love it. Kanye is a martyr for Trump. 
Is there anyway we could have someone on the inside check on this brave man??

WTF are they doing to him?
First they came for the gorillas, and I said nothing because I was not a gorilla. Then they came for the batshit rappers, and I said nothing because I was not a batshit rapper....
Is this dude going to come out like Jack Nicholson? I always thought Kanye was a little crazy but I admire what he fucking did. Admitting to liking Trump would certainly lose him fans. He had nothing to gain from it. Going at FB and Google and you are deemed mentally insane.

We should be ready to support this dude. 
#SPRING KANYE
His name is Kanye West

His name is Kanye West
Kanye's support for Trump may be the first sane thing he's ever said in his life. Now he is a political prisoner.
This may sound funny, but I believe that Kanye is in their right now turning the tables on the Doctors & red pilling them to the point of taking over the institution from the inside out.
FREE KANYE
He was dropping truth bombs.
Some people think the robbery of his wife was committed by foreign intelligence agents
He's an asshole but at least he is America's asshole. We support you KW.
Honestly though... where the f is he?!  Is there any proof that he was hospitalized forcibly?  Did he make any statements at all about feeling paranoid or depressed?  At what point was he taken to the hospital?  Right after the show or ...
His San Jose concert was The only one where I have seen a report of his specifically mentioning "pizza gate". I wonder if anyone has video or audio of this? 
Dicks out for Kanye
This is the same psych ward that stars like Lindsey Lohan and Britney Spears have been to. From what I've read so far, there's some serious shit going down behind those doors.
WAKE  UP MR. WEST!
" fuck you and your corporation y'all can't control me" Kanye has been speaking out for a long time against the machine. Glad more people on this side of the isle are starting to see it.

omg kanye is bernard, it all makes sense
Did he admit himself or what.
He shouldn't be in a hospital, haven't these idiots seen the music video for stronger?
Let him go. It's obvious that he just currently came to his senses. 
All the shit this dude has said and done, and now only after coming out for Trump and against the MSM he's hospitalized? 
I always thought Kanye was another degenerate gear in the establishment machine; a musical tool to distract fools from reality or even self expression at times.


Given recent events, I think he's changed and they're trying to "fix" him. As far as I'm concerned, he may have been born again, only to be subject to whatever they're doing to him once more.


Never thought I'd say this, but I'm rooting for Kanye. I hope he comes out okay.
grab your tinfoil hats boys
Same shit happened to Tupac. Open your eyes people 
I never was a fan. Until now.  

Oh, I did like the look he put on Mike Meyers face when he said George Bush doesn't care about black people. Classic TV moment right there.
This is painful upvoting a Kanye post. Fuck.

They're gonna make him commit "suicide" aren't they?
Hey guys, please excuse my ignorance but what does MSM mean? Also what was the crux of kanyes rant , I typically skip most news to do with mainstream stars so I'm a bit out of the loop !! 
He's like the stoner guy in the Cabin in the Woods, he's already  insane so the brainwashing had no effect on him. 
The way he treated based Tay Tay is not cool. 


MR WEST WOKE UP
I think Kanye is at a reeducation camp or getting a lobotomy to erase his memories of what he knows. 
Scott Adams says Kanye might make a run for president someday

If he does, it's officially the greatest timeline
I know this might get lost in the sea of comments here, but Kanye is still alive and actually liking things on IG... He liked his creative director's picture, take a look at how eerie it is...

https://www.instagram.com/p/BNXYc15jyDA/

I hope he doesn't come out of it messed up and indoctrinated. We love you Kanye! Stay real!
I know the guy had a larger than life ego. But throwing him in a psych ward is beyond fucked up.
I WAS A WITNESS 
CAN TRUMP PLEASE REACH OUT TO KANYE?!?!

At least send out a tweet hoping he's alright. 
The Media knows that Kanye is a living meme like Trump. They know that they had to stop him.

#FreeKayne
Are they doing this because the Kanye for President thing? Maybe "they" think he could win so have to assassinate his character now. 
I thought it was because he is a fraud and a hack and his conscience caught up to him?
Anyone have a transcript of what he said?

The guy is a nut job entertainer, we should not waste any energy on him. He is not important to American politics, his opinion matters not. 


this is funny as hell to me. kanye isn't being imprisoned. i am a huge kanye fan, and the dude is genuinely unwell. he's been doing crazy stuff for a decade, but i think that it's kim's robbery + the insane stress of the tour, coupled with the anniversary of his mother's death for which he feels (partly) responsible. I was at his concert. It was insane. Do that three times a week + multiple fashion shows + shoe rollout + new songs + shoot video and you're exhausted. 

not everything centers on trump. kanye has been saying crazy stuff, yes, but not to this intensity or often. he was actually fairly toned down since yeezus, you only ever hear from him when he says some crazy shit though. 
Kanye is gonna be re released as a country singer lmao 
WGAF
Why are we supposed to feel sorry for this egotistical, arrogant music-stealing prick again? Forgive me for being so out of the loop, but last time I checked Kanye was someone to *laugh at, not cheer for.*
eh, in his case it might not be the worst thing.
And for being a massive alcoholic. 
In their defense. Kayne is nuts. 
Hopefully they keep him and keep him feom ever poluting the airwaves again....
Real talk he's probably just pulling a stunt so he doesn't have to pay back all the people for all the cancelled show tickets.
To be fair, Kanye was a nutter long before now. Im not surprised at all this came to a head here. 
Omg whatever! He is fucking crazy lmao it isn't because he spoke out against his or spoke out for that....
He's a fucking loon! 
This is what happens when you spend multiple concerts not doing your job but spreading your stupid thoughts around....
I for one don't think it's cool that he's on the trump team now lol and I'm sure Donald doesn't give two fucks either.
Don't feel too badly for him.  He'll be out once insurance pays for the cancelled tour.
I'm pretty sure cancelling his tour is what motivates people to admit him. That's really stupid of him and it does sound like he might need it although his message was on point

This guy fucked over a lot of people who bought tickets for his show and drove miles to see it. We pick some dumb fucks to stand behind sometimes. Sorry.
The elders of protocol of zion.  wake up before it's too late my fellow Americans.
Yeah, this guy is a genius.  T_D is spot on, except for the fascination with shit for brains.
No, he really is bat $hit nutter butter crazy!
Should I feel sympathy for this racist? I probably shouldn't hold a grudge especially since bringing attention to satanism and child trafficking is bigger than racism. I'd give him props and forget his racist ways if he was outspoken about his containment. Kanye, rant about shit that matters with your passion, not some stupid dumb ass shit about people not getting awards because of their skin color.
He's in the ward because he is psychotic.. Although I applaud him for siding with Trump, lets not start false conspiracies. I kind of feel bad for the guy because from personal experience - this guy is probably going to be mentally ill for the rest of his life. Once you lose your shit, it's nearly impossible to get your shit back.
Can you please stop glorifying this retard? I mean seriously, The Donald has gone mainstream and it sucks. I'm outta here centepedes it was a good run
i know we want supporters 

but really ...FUCK Kanye West 
No he isn't. Everything he does is calculated for publicity. Fuck Kanye

Yet the failing New York Times [still hasn't updated its results...](http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/president)
Congratulations to President-Elect Trump for winning the presidential election *again*!

On the distaff side lets prepare ourselves for another round of weeping and wailing and act outs from the crybabies who didn't get their way. Not to mention the re-re-re-recounts which likely will be approved by democrat appointed liberal judges. Me, I'll admit to some holding of breath. Because the damn dead democrats, they can't vote just once, oh, no, they all vote a dozen or more times!
When Trump won, I was on a 3 day emotional high. Honestly it just didn't feel real, sometimes I still feel like I'm in a dream. It seems like the Democrats and the Greens are working real hard to remind me he really did win. I'm feeling like I should thank them at this point.
Spez also blocks and filters comments that are not well liked as well. They do their own filtering based on content that they don't like or determine if discussions don't align right with all the chatter going on in the online world. More specifically, they filter comments so that users can't see the actual response, hence why sometimes comments never get responded too or up/down voted. They simply hide the content they disagree with or take personal action in doing such, even without mods knowledge. 

Recounts, regardless are to appease a base. It's very interesting that time and money is being spent on this while Flint Michigan is of concern. Speaking of which, guess Bernie is all talk and no action. All that money he raised as well as Hillary could have been utilized better in supporting the people of Flint. But all you got were attack ads on Trump and money raised for recounts. It's fascinating to see someone under spend and still win yet Hillary had the dark money credits from Wall Street that could have gotten Flint going without the government. Guess Bernie and Hillary are taking a back seat to crisis since all that mattered was winning and not assisting the people from their "social party" platform. Not to mention, the Clinton Foundation and it's purpose... To assist what? It's like watching someone reach for power when they didn't need the offices of the presidency, then suddenly Clinton without a trace... "goodbye" - I mean, really? That's the lefts behavior after all this? Raise more money, Soros influence, recounts, and additional media criticism? The left is only concerned when votes or money are being spent. Otherwise, they close shop and split.

#HILLARY DIDN'T WIN IN ANY DIMENSION, FOLKS
You know, I've always been a Republican, but I have to say when I voted for Trump, I wasn't really on the Trump Train.  I was more into preventing Hilary from being president.  Once he won on election night, I was happy and content.  We had won, but really, I couldn't care less about Trump.  

Thats all changed now.  With every retarded thing the left has said about Trump, I've started to like Trump more and more.  I'm 100% on the Trump Train now, and thank God there are no brakes!
Soooo, that's it? Recount business is over?  Trumps 100% the PEOTUS?  **Tell me for the love of God, I can't take it anymore!!**

Drudge report saying Soros missed the deadline in Pennsylvania for a recount.
Hey Trump, I'm not sick of winning yet.
There's a thousand 'pedes on this sub for every elector!
L A N D  S L I D E
There seems to be some confusion so let me just point out, today was always going to be Michigans day to approve or certify the final count.  A week or so ago was the day Michigan has to finish counting to arrive at the total they submit for approval.  This has nothing to do with any recounts.  I think its just been more closely followed in the news because it was the last state to be called and knowing the result wasnt necessary for the election.  I would guess other states have a similar process.
#306!!!!!!!!!!!

#306,828!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think the whole recount thing is just to try and make Trump seem like an illegitimate president. Same thing with the crap about the popular vote. The idea is to rally support among the left to keep them agitated and make it harder for him to enact his first 100 days,  and try to handicap his momentum.

Hillary has no chance even if she rigs WI we won't be having a newsweek "Madame President" forget about Hillary she is just going to fade away. She is old and all she was worth to Soros was a puppet. She was a terrible puppet and worse deceiver. Eventually Soros will die off with her.  
A big tip o' the hat to our brilliant Founding Fathers who knew that days like this would come, when the swarming masses in cities would vote for a dangerous criminal instead of a patriot.  They trusted those who live **on the land**, the farmers, the mechanics, the small business people, people like that.  We may not believe in THEM very much but they believed in us.

Across the centuries, I send a 'thank you' to those who have given me so much.  Your trust will NOT be betrayed.  I swear it.
This was my first eligible election and I am so proud to have had an influence voting for Trump in Michigan's primary and general. I was wondering what was taking so long with Michigan's results but now it's official!
Did Michigan do an automatic recount already, or did it just take a really long fucking time to tally the votes?  If it really took this long, and they haven't recounted yet, how the fuck are they going to recount before the deadline?
After MI even if they cheat WI and PA its still 276 to 262 we still win. Get over it shills. We win TWICE
We should fund a recount of NH, trump needs that extra 4 votes to rub it in.
STILL WINNING
Guys, this is big news, because now Trump electors have been officially certified.

Being certified will entitle the electors to vote on December 19. That means that even if certification in WI and PA gets delayed by Stein's guerilla tactics, Trump will STILL have 276 certified electors - enough to win outright.
#SOMEONE TELL THESE GUYS

This is annoying. I get it, we won, let's move on and MAGA.
Lmao
#That's good, but did CNN fact check it?
We have reached escape velocity.
THANK YOU MORE WINNING 
How many electoral votes would trump theoretically have if they stole the three recount states?
I got really excited and thought this was WI for a second.
I think Stein's recount deadline was Monday for MI, and Wed for PA.  Any word on those?
It's like Groundhog Day with all the winning we're doing 
**BTFO LIBCUCKS**
So tired of winning at this point... please stop winning so bigly... /s
I have seen this officially announced like 10 times, folks are you tired of winning yet?
*Some day you will find her*

*Caught beneath the landslide*

*Of the TrumpTrain Supernova in the sky!*
LANSLIDE 
Hillary Clinton will NEVER be president.
WEH HELL A LANDSLIDE BRING IT DOWN
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING! COMPLICATED BUSINESS!!
Now I finally understand what Trump meant when he said we'd get tired of winning, fucks sake how many times are they gonna call this state
Can I get a **landslide** anyone?
All this winning is exhausting! But don't let it stop!!!
I would love to go back to that night and relive the whole series of events. 
Just posting to see this "Spez" button :)

Spez: Fuck Yeah!

Spez 2: Fuck u/Spez
I AM EXHAUSTED. So much winning
Give me the 5 million, I'm creating my own island with blackjack & (of age) hookers, no spirit cooking & you better order toppings on your pizza.
OVER 300 ELECTORAL BABY!!!!
#WINNING EVERY DAY
I wonder how many electoral votes he really got without all the fraud, dead voters and illegal aliens? He definitely got Nevada and New Hampshire and probably Virginia, Colorado, Maine and Minnesota too!
I'm happy. I'm positive. I'm HIGH ENERGY. 

But still: Fuck Liberalism.
NANI?
HaHAaaaaaaaaaa
Trump 306 says: I just won the election!
MAGA!

CNN has updated their election results map to reflect this.
**..."WE'LL WIN SO MUCH, YOU'LL GET BORED WITH WINNING"...** 
But how can Bernie still win this? 
TRUMP HAS ACHIEVED SELF-SUSTAINING WINNING

NOT EVEN HE CANNOT STOP THE WINNING. HIS MESSAGE WAS A WARNING TO US, TO PREPARE
If there was a recount every month for the next eight years I still would not get tired of winning.
The wall just got ten feet higher. 
So this is what he meant when he said we would be tired of winning?
WHERE ARE THE BRAKES?! IM GETTING NAUSEOUS FROM ALL THIS WINNING! ITS TO FAST FOLKS!
Man, seeing news as amazing as this makes me break out in laughter. Get me off this train, I'm getting tired of winning.
B..But he's not qualified!

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
wow, its almost as if recounting the same thing several times will give you the same results or something...
Only president to win Michigan 5 times...
The fix is in.  

This all came out of those meetings Soros had the week after losing.  It's all been planned.  Except the Pennsylvania recount. They messed that one up. 

MAGA!
Everytime they do a recount and Trump remains winning he should get double the electoral votes for that state. 
I feel bad for the Democrats if ID is required for voting and the illegals are deported.  They will never win again except in a few counties in CA.  
 I'm really confused,  could someone please explain this to me? I thought he already won Michigan. Were the votes split for the electorate count or what?


We're at a point now where even if Stein and Clinton and the other liberal fraudsters got both Iowa, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania recounted, and *all* three states turned for Hillary, Trump would still have won. Suck it, Shillary ... oh yeah, and also, please go rot in hell.
I've been at work all day (typical Republican). Does this mean Trump is 109% secure now? I can stop worrying about tree lady and the cunt stealing the election?
#NO BRAKES
I feel like I'm in an endless loop of winning.
Stein is not a "muh Soros" plant.

She is Druid Jill, doesn't give a fuck. Wants all elections to have integrity and is smart enough to milk losers for cash.
So...recount?
[deleted]
The "compassionate" party spends millions of cuck dollars on recounts to no avail, when they could be providing food and gifts to children in need during the holidays. Oh, that's right...they practice occult rituals. Shows who they really are. "go fund HRC!" Nope.
#NO REFUNDS
I'm tired of winning (I'm not). 
This is stating that Jill can ask for a recount? When was this article published...?
I'm so tired of winning!
We have the best triggers.

Wait, so he didn't win this first? I don't get it.
I cannot get used to all of these winning
#WIN WIN WIN
The reason this is important - "Hill Shill" Stein CANNOT change the results in Michigan with a recount. Once again, progressives have been completely and utterly BLOWN THE FUCK OUT by reality.

Mr. President, I'm so sick of winning!
I'm so sick of this shit.  Every time we have an important election the lame ass Dems are going to challenge the results.  Give up losers. You suck.
Now that you are finally done counting, can you go ahead a count those again please?  Thank you ~ Jill

Where can I read this. Never mind. Found it
No Brakes!!!
This sub should be safe now.
Probably won't get seen, but heard on the news that Jill Stein wrote an 800K check to file a recount in Michigan.

Time for the third count; if anything changes, I will be very angry.
Jill Stein should go sit on a cactus.
I don't believe it. Count them again.

Well until the recount anyway lol
Wait until the recount
*How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old lady?*
 
*I love the minority people!*
Wow its been officially called just before the cutoff date for Jill stein to ask for a recount. Sounds fishy if you ask me
[removed]
It's not official until the votes are cast
The only thing they can do is pretend it never happened.
They are just going to say, "If he did this much damage with a machete imagine what he could have done with a gun!" to play to their anti-gun agenda.

They live in an alternate reality where speculation = truth
"See? Gun control worked!"

or

"Imagine how much worse it would have been if he *DID* have a gun!"
Of course they will eventually say "imagine how much more would have been injured or killed if he used a gun". I already hear from CNN that if it was terrorism, why did he not do it at a ballgame or big event where there were more people. 
Shills maaaaaddd, bro.  Every comment getting a downvote. lol  Bring it, SHILLSTERS!
Didn't use a gun.....??
Vox's article had a sentence saying "the shooting was a tragedy", so they were either lamenting that the suspect was shot by the officer, or they just lied that the attack was with a gun.
The current liberal narrative in response to this, is that IF he had a gun there would have been deaths instead of injuries. SO this is still a gun issue to them. I think IF he had a bomb there possibly would have been more deaths, or maybe if he had a tactical nuke more would die? 
By morning it'll be repackaged as "White Officer Shoots Unarmed Black Refugee!!" 
Add 100 lbs and blue hair tho
I still can't fathom why the majority of the US must cater to the minority groups. LGBT is roughly <3% of America. 12.3% of the US population is black. 1% of the US population is Muslim. Why should the majority bend the knee to the minority?!
OSU Young Republican's club will most likely get a surge of new members. 
he also was stopped WITH A GUN. BY A POLICE MAN.
They will just blame us and call us racist for pointing out facts.
When will the cucks, liberals, Democrats, etc. come back to the table of America so we can start a bipartisan American coalition to counter the culture and violence of Islam in all the ways that make it incompatible with the U.S. Constitution and the American way of life?


This coalition of Democrats (if they want to survive) and Republicans should be implementing a total policy solution that includes many directives, including but not limited to:


* expose and refute Sharia Law in principle, and in practice oppose it in America
* oppose in principle and practice Islam's unacceptable treatment of non-believers, minorities, women, etc.
* encourage Muslim leadership that brings Islam to an interpretation compatible with modern civilization
* an intervention on immigration of certain populations that come from dangerous countries
* a contained but absolutely destructive operation to delete ISIS on all levels
GET THEM THE FUCK OUT OF HERE
If you could somehow work in that he was stopped by a "good guy with a gun" that would be best. They hate that line. 
You know...when I started dating my wife in high school thirty years ago, she was left of center. Mainly normal women shit about caring for less fortunate and that crap. I get it, but don't dwell on it. Maybe they will grow up these folks. My four kids aren't SJW and just ignore it on campus. Real problem seems to be these kids have no alternative viewpoint. That's not healthy.

Good job though OP.
That's not what cognitive dissonance is 
Did he work for Bob Creamer?
Gun free zone.
It gets better, a gun was what stopped him and saved innocent lives.    And it was a white male cop who used it to do so.
What they are actually doing right now is downplaying it saying white people go on shooting sprees more.
Liberals right now are either:

(a) Completely ignoring the situation

or

(b) Crying about how the poor black Muslim got shot by a white police officer pig in another case of ***RACIST GUN VIOLENCE***

I've seen both so far
"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on."


Let's try not to get excited just because something horrible was done by a certian race or religion. We arent fucking liberals who need to politicise every event to make thier "team" look better. The man who shot that scumbag terrorist is a god damn american hero no matter what he looks like. MAGA!
If they had one, their brain would hurt.
All the more proof that we need to ban full-auto assault knives.
*Inconvenient Truths*
((UNKNOWN MOTIVE))  Suspect Self-Identified as white/Christian CIS-Male
It is time for the state of Ohio to end all gun free zones. 
No place that doesn't have a metal detector staffed by an armed guard should be able to prevent legally aged american citizens from carrying a firearm or other weapon properly concealed in a responsible fashion anywhere in the state of Ohio.

Period. Our citizens of legal age 21 should be able to have their civil rights recognized and be able to defend themselves from all enemy's that are foreign or domestic while they are in the buckeye state.

Repeal all prohibitions NOW. 
"Oh goddammit, at least use a gun you fuck! I have no respect for refugees anymore, they are stupid."
It's like a Kekian grand slam of STFU to Libtards.

Notice how not a single post on r/politics talks about the results of Michigan's recount, or the background of the attacker at OSU? All they've talked about today is more people who don't like Trump. For a subreddit that's named after the broad spectrum of politics, they sure are extremely biased in favor of only less than 50% of the topic
They are going to say why couldn't they use pepper spray or a taser 
Lemme guess - fake news?
The only thing they can do is attack he cop for using a gun and not mortal kombat.

I'm convinced Orwell was a prophet at this point 
I came across this news on BBC FB page. Guess what? The predominant comments said that this case reinforce the rhetoric that there is a dire need to strengthen gun control.
Hair is not green.
haha, go over to asktrumpsupporters... seems we have a dew shills there still losing their fucking minds over everything.
Can't find the story on my facebook news tabs, but Miss Minnesota USA with her garbage bag is right there. smdh.
The angle I have seen them take so far is that he was "bullied" and pushed over the edge because he was Muslim and was made to feel unwanted in our country... and I quote "How many times do you think he heard go 'back to isis' before he finally snapped?"
imagine if it was a white christian male wielding a knife.. you'd never stop hearing ab out it.

"This is Donald Trump's fault! Reeeeeeeee"
No, they are still pissed about the "gun violence" and "gun culture" - So in other words the OSU cop was the bad guy here shooting the attacker. I swear to "Allah" we should just round up all the Muslim migrants here and send them to specifically liberal areas and let them feel the cultural enrichment. After they take care of that problem for us, then lets ship them back to their collective hell holes in the Middle East to return to killing one another.

Can someone edit that image that goes "accepting your death" to "accepting your life"
Turns out that just one act of violence from one person doesn't mean their entire "community" should be blamed. Dur.
Only mind is real Grasshopper. 
Not trolling, honestly don't know, if he didn't use a gun and there were reports of a gun, what did he use?
wouldn't this prove their argument more? I mean he didn't kill anyone and the police killed him. So banning guns means less gun attacks and less death
I mean he had a gun,  he just saved it for the cops instead of the kids
Didn't he have a gun on him though?
It takes a certain type of soul sickness to rejoice in an act of violence because it justifies your political views
Never mind his anti-Western Jihadi manifesto, the ISIS operative MO or the fact that ISIS have just claimed responsibility.

Which is more plausible? It's funny how many people will do mental gymnastics to try and say the Russian conspiracy is valid but illegal voters are not. 
The fact they don't have the presence of mind, and/or the conscious to self police themselves when being stared dead in the face by an obvious contradiction like this shows you **how far gone** these people are.  Beyond fact and reason.

Weird how everyone has a cute, funny politically enlightened kid these days.
I get a kick out of all the people on the left who ridicule Trump as some mentally-challenged dope. He's a billionaire and routinely makes the entire MSM look like drooling idiots.
He's brilliant, a genius. And I love that our enemies don't know that. I've never been this impressed with a politician before. (in my lifetime) Business is just at another level than the dying establishment system.
Indeed. Bill Still had a similar report summarizing the conclusions of the Based AJ back in March.

I still can't believe the dems found a running mate that even makes Hillary more likeable by comparison.
They are talking about trying to make him the nominee for 2020, please please let that happen.

"Coded hate speech"

I got PTSD from shooting my AR, though it was only after I realized I didn't bring enough to the range and got upset that my day was cut short. Does that count?
What the fuck? How can a man be that much of a pussy? 
"If the government tells you that you don't need an AR-15, then you probably need an AR-15."
That's not PTSD.  That's low T and it is a serious condition.  He should see his doctor about treatments or start lifting heavy things and not eat like a bitch.
Kuntzman
> ‚ÄúThe recoil bruised my shoulder.‚Äù

I'd get PTSD standing next to someone firing a full auto AR-15 who can hold it in such a way that the "recoil" can "bruise" his shoulder.
Where is this dude getting a fully auto AR
This was the perfect example of echo chamber political "journalism". The author wrote it for the expectations of his audience and never considered for a moment that one of us "poor southerners" would call him on his lie.
All I get is a hard on,  what am I doing wrong? 
The gun scared me and hurt my fee fees :(

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!

Anyone who thinks a 5.56 rifle is loud and scary has never fired a 12 gauge, btw.
[Extremely relevant and insightful!](https://youtu.be/WgPCMw3S3mA)
I hate the Daily News. I wouldn't give it to a homeless person to wipe with 
What a beta cuck
I'm sure it could give someone ptsd, because they are so terrified of guns, loud noises, and the truth. Just like these people that claim rape if a man says hello to them.
As a brit who went to the gun range for the first time recently I can tell you I did also infact get PTSD.

Near enough every day lying in bed I think back to that moment, the loud noises, the shocked looks of those around me, the bullet casings hitting the floor.

And then I come back around, realising where I am, In Britain and nowhere near a gun. I cry softly, the smell of gunpowder still in my nose and the elevated pressure from the recoil in the air...

I cry because I fucking miss that Deagle so much, why does Britain have to be so cucked and anti gun? Fuck I'd even settle for just the glock, even if 9 para barely has a kick to it. Or hey, maybe a 1911, 45 felt really nice... But 50AE...... Excuse me a sec, the bullet casings I smuggled back and me need some alone time.
CUCKOLDRY LEVEL 11.
I was talking to a group think lib friend about going to the range. You could see the anxiety and irrational fear start to creep up.
**FUCK THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA**
My father in law just bought a new colt ar-15 and we went and shot it Sunday after they got back from church. 
It was a great morning, no stress.
Did he shoot it with no ear protection or something? That's the only reason I can image actually being injured or having any problem at all.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T3qjpZB6ME
[deleted]
This sounds like the type of person that makes me nervous on the range.
I too suffer from PTSD of my long lasting freedom boner when I shoot guns. 
WTF. These liberals man. I can't even. They need not touch any form of weaponry. 
Holy shit. Someone get this guy a safe room
If Shaun King is the Senior Justice Writer at your paper it maybe fake news.
His report isn't even accurate.  The AR-15 shoots a very high velocity small caliber round.  There is very little recoil -  There is absolutely no possibility of 'recoil bruising my shoulder'.    Only modified or early M-16s were full auto, the later versions had 3 round burst mode instead.  All AR-15 weapons are easy, fun and enjoyable to shoot.    The smell of cordite is wonderful.   Sounds like this reporter has mental problems.
I got PTSD from NJ's magazine restrictions and how long it took for me to reload the cartridge.  I only rented a hour of range time and I didn't want to run out.
My 8 year old son shoots my AR weekly, after Halloween I had him shooting pumpkins with it at 100 yards distance, he makes me so proud. "Aim small miss small & he has gotten good"
Got PTSD after being charged  buttload for only firing off 3 boxes of bullets on the range.
Went out and shot an AK with a friend of mine who's building up an impressive gun collection for a 19 year old. It was my first time shooting any real firearm. Not once was I thinking "this could be a traumatic experience." Then again, I'm a stable human who isn't looking to self-diagnose a mental illness at every term. Also, for some people who actually have PTSD because of gun violence, holding/shooting the gun themselves can be a sort of therapeutic exposure. Helps some people get in the mindset that it's not the tool itself that does the killing, it's the intentions of the person who wields it.

It's really not this complicated. These people are all celebrities. They spend their days flying between the coasts. They're all rich and disconnected as fuck. None of their jobs are being outsourced. None of their drinking water is poison. None of their neighborhoods are being saddled with economic refugees from the most backwards countries on the planet. None of them even have a meaningful stake in the prosperity of this country. We mock their insincere threats to leave America, but they do, in fact, have that option if things go bad.

"The stereotypes are wrong!!!" *proceeds to exemplify Muslim stereotype*

Can't make this shit up.
[Hey man listen to the nobel prize winner on this.](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/147/456/35a.jpg)
He wasn't angry at negative Muslim stereotypes.  
  
He knew full well the stereotypes are accurate.  
  
The "anger" is a hoax concocted by Islamists and Sharia law advocates (CAIR) to try to push themselves higher up on the Left's victim pyramid.  
  
The goal is to make people so afraid of "piling on" Muslims that they leave them alone to set up their own Sharia enclaves in Little Mogadishu, MN.
This is the same as SJW hypocrite flip out.

Even Muslims have to deal with the radical left fucking them over.
He literally said "I'm a lone wolf" and the news anchors believed him. They were like - "He said it himself". ABC WORLD NEWS. National TV. LOL 
‚ÄúNo! I must kill the stereotype‚Äù he shouted                     
The radio said ‚ÄúNo, Abdul Razak Ali Artan. You are the stereotype.‚Äù     
And then Abdul Razak Ali Artan was a terrorist.
That was a strange response to not wanting to be stereotyped.  But remember what really matters, he was afraid to show he was Muslim because of what he saw on TV so he is the real victim!  Am I progressive now?
"American perception of Muslims being violent is completely wrong. To show them how wrong they are I'm going to go be violent and prove them right." - that guy

As a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, who also later graduated from SHSU and was active on campus.

Radical Christians protest on campus and say ass sex is wrong. Their was like 3 people who were not even students but apart of a crazy colt. They just were stupid and called for no violence.

We also had like 7 people in protest in front of the Planned Parent Hood clinic who just held signs.

Their were plenty of Muslim students that were confused because people did not hate them. They were 19-24 year olds looking for some sort of hatred. Nobody gave a shit and the left wing active students just agreed with them. Nobody cared.

We even had a professor from Iran who was admittedly against radical Islam, and he was a Muslim himself. This confused many students. They even called his Jokes racist....Yea...Because he jokes about his friends being the "BOMB". 

Na, Most Muslims are not a product of their faith in America. Their unique and just like every other American that self-determination matters most.

Radical Muslims believes it is their duty to kill everything that is against their beliefs.

Radical Christians just say dump shit with signs.

>Muslim community further proves him wrong by not condemning the attack. 
Apparently he was 18 yet how was he so fucking bald? Don't think I've ever seen an 18 year old with that hairline.
This one makes me sad for my Muslim friend. He respects his religion, but fuck heads like this guy keep making it worse and worse.  It's terribly sad and I know he's depressed about it.

update from the election commission here http://elections.wi.gov/node/4457 

actually she owes more, in their news release it says "unfortunately there was an error in adding up figures from the 72 Wisconsin county clerks of their estimated recount costs, and the actual total is $3,898,340."
http://elections.wi.gov/node/4457

Yesterday, the Commission released an estimate of nearly $3.5 million to the campaigns of Green Party candidate Jill Stein and independent candidate Rocky Roque De La Fuente. Unfortunately, there was an error in adding up figures from the 72 Wisconsin county clerks of their estimated recount costs, and the actual total is **$3,898,340**.

SPEZ:
 
Monday, December 12:  County canvass boards **need** to be completed by 8 p.m.

Tuesday, **December 13**:  WEC staff will prepare the official recount canvass certification by 3 p.m.

He's using his freedom of speech to twitter bitches heads into a triggered spin.   

 People that like to play with matches and flags and think they are triggering patriots are MOST triggered by this tweet. Trump didn't even have to flick a bic
Now the media is going to defend the burning of flags while showing footage of a bunch of crazies doing so.  Then the talking heads will preach about how this nation was built on the notion of freedom of speech and expression, outlined in our constitution. Then after the commercial break they will completely flip and talk about repealing the 2nd amendment. 

This really is some advance 4d chess Trump is playing. 
Are we about to get an "actually it is illegal to start fires in public" moment?
There are exceptions to every rule. A constitutional amendment would be required to make this a crime, however, since the supreme Court has already addressed this.
I do not agree with President Elect on this one.
I really don't care either way.  On one hand I don't believe people should disrespect the flag, but on the other hand when people do it, it shows who they really are. I'm really just amazed at the amazing shitposting/trolling power of Trump!
We'll have to disagree on this. But, he is technically still a private citizen. 
You get an upvote just for using 'rustling jimmies'.
I love Gutfeld.  He was not for Trump during the election, but he is masterful at using Liberal logic against themselves.
Every time I've seen this guy on TV, he's absolutely brutal. I loved his comments on Anthony Weiner. He said Weiner was such a scumbag that nothing was beneath him...besides a camera.

"Fundamental values of inclusion and belonging"

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES
Easy fix: President Trump can use the threat of completely cutting off federal funding to Harvard and other institutions, cities and states with similar policies.  If Harvard wants to subsidize low income students, they can do so out of their endowment.  Why should taxpayers be forced to finance illegal activities like employing illegal immigrants?
[A Harvard centipede, you say?](https://i.sli.mg/WdapKX.png)
How the fuck are illegal immigrants affording Harvard tuition?
Oh boy, I can't wait until I one day go to Harv-

Aaaaaand they're cucks...
How do we verify this?


Is there a link to where we can view it for ourselves or is this for members only?
Northwestern centipede. They put out in their annual financial email that they will start giving illegals preference and pay for their college with our money. Disgusting.
You'd think Harvard of all places would be less ignorant about what the people of America truly want. These academic and industrial safe spaces can stupefy even the most brilliant minds. 
Sounds about right. Harvard -Sanctuary City all by itself. 
Could you imagine if this was during Clinton's presidency with Janet Reno?! There would swat teams storming every university. 
Faust?  No kidding!
It's a felony to aid and abet an illegal alien. Report your dean to the authorities .
I would rather run our government with community college graduates than Harvard graduates. Liberalism is a mental disorder and higher education is it's biggest victim. 
And many people who are qualified based on merit can't get in lol.
This letter reads like such a fucking sob story.  Crying like a baby about "inclusion and belonging," and announcing that Harvard is now essentially a sanctuary university.  Give me a fucking break!
It seems like he fancies Harvard an Ivy League underground railroad. 
Hiring criminals is so progressive.  Who needs law and order?  Silly racists. /s
https://www.ice.gov/webform/hsi-tip-form
Cut the funding. 
Fellow Citizen of Massachusetts here, and I know for a fact that the state made it possible for illegals to vote. 
What a bunch of cucks. The money squandered on illegal aliens could have been used to help bright impoverished citizens escape their current dire situations and guarantee them brighter futures. 
I agree with you, OP -- don't report it in any way that you could be identified. I could see some crazy liberal expelling you for that. I'm a Princeton grad and during my time there, some people were expelled for reasons that were bad, but still far from deserving expulsion. Don't risk it.

(I will refrain from a "Harvard Sucks" chant for my fellow 'pede!)
a harvard centipede??? there are dozens of you!
Oh my fucking god what a bunch of morons.

Just like the same geniuses who posted that they were illegal on social media or that schools were "sanctuaries" for illegals only make it *that* much easier for the border patrol to track down these mongs.


My liberal high school teacher told our whole class the girl who got into Harvard from our school was illegal and that it was a shame no Georgian school would allow her in because "education is a right everyone deserves."
It has to be said: what in the flying fuck is going on in the world. It's like the past 8 years these fuckers just went wild and made their wildest dreams come true. No regard for law, no regard for logic or actual fairness, just do what feels good and with a self righteous certainty that it's all ok because you mean well. And I'm being generous and not even talking about the corrupt ones! It's like we all knew it's been going on but it has all been happening at warp speed and we almost totally lost control. Insane.
I can't wait to join you next year! Harvard/MIT centipedes... We must make some sort of organization. MIT Republicans haven't been active since 1998 and Harvards rejected the Don.
Somebody's getting their funding cut starting next year...
Why did I bother getting a green card the legal way, via tonnes of paperwork, fees and hard work? I didn't know Harvard lets you take courses undocumented :/ 
You know you're an idiot when you call an illegal alien 'undocumented'.

Change the language, and the behavior will follow.
Wasnt faust the guy who made a deal with the devil?
These schools like socialism so much that we should reclaim and redistribute their money:). You know in the spirit of communism
Defund every aspect. The endowment is large enough anyway.  Then arrest anyone who has broken the law. Make an example of them.  Make multiple arrests at multiple universities and make the perp walk very public.  Do this for weeks and see what happens at universities.

Spez: Arrest anyone who gets in the way for obstruction and full court press on the charges.
I don't understand this argument I keep seeing about DACA and immigrants/refugees in general. That is, these are people that came from tough circumstances and we can take them in and give them these amazing opportunities and they can become great contributing members of society.

Well what about actual American citizens? I'm sure some DACA kids are great students and would do well at Harvard and make some great contributions. But, it's a zero sum game. There is only so much aid and so many slots in classes. Every spot we give to a DACA student or a refugee student (like our good friend at Ohio State this morning) is a spot denied to an American citizen who could have also made an amazing contribution.

Why do lawbreakers and children of lawbreakers who owe no allegiance to the United States deserve opportunities over the real and true citizens of this country? Why should a legal immigrant be denied that slot over a DACA student? It's honestly so offensive to me every time I hear this argument.
Well I guess I'll be writing a letter to Harvard tomorrow telling them all donations from me will be stopped.

And running some facebook ads for those who went to harvard and "liked" donald trump's page telling them to do the same.
Intentionally creating/fostering an environment where crime can take place more easily makes you an accomplice. Diversity doesn't mean break the law. Those are staff/student spots in one of our, if not the world's, best/most-renowned universities. They should absolutely not be going to people who circumvent the system. There are too many people who spent time and money to get here legally in hopes of the same. Too many fully capable students being shunned in favor of liberal ideology.


What it boils down to is worshipping illegals, for the very fact that they are a living, breathing form of all that is un-American. Liberals are so brainwashed into hating themselves and their country that they will fall in love with anything that will destroy the foundations of our society. 


Swarming our society with people who were not born here and who do not understand American culture(if you did you wouldn't come illegally), or respect the rule of law, another foundation of our society, is a cuck's wet dream.
Does Harvard also assist the illegals with the identity theft that their community uses to open bank accounts, get loans, and otherwise commit financial fraud in the names of other people?
Trump needs to make Universities like this pay a fine for harboring illegal aliens. There should be a penalty for abetting a criminal act.
I have met several Harvard Alum and former lecturers. They love to tell you about how they went there. Many are bright, some don't have practical knowledge to help guide their research. The common quality amongst them is they were insufferable assholes.  
it's really cool that people were bitching about Bernie's plan for free college and illegal immigrants are going to fucking Harvard while middle class citizens have no chance in hell of getting in there. 
Imagine all the Americans that could have went to Harvard instead. üò° 
These mother fuckers have "the best" law school yet they cant follow the law? This should automatically give them zero credibility and revoke the prestige status this school has. What a fucking joke.
Would harvard have a problem with hundreds of centipedes just showing up in lecture halls to take classes as undocumented students or would they call the police to report tresspassing?

Seems like a good protest idea.
Former Harvard Centipede here.  Haven't given a dime to the university in a very long time because of crap like this.  Does Faust not appreciate how regular Americans will feel when she's bending over backwards to accommodate people who are here illegally at the expense of the people in-country whose tax dollars pay for all those research grants, federally-subsidized loans, and tax exemptions that keep the university going?  Her short-sightedness is a serious threat to the institution's continued well-being.
It's sad to see how you guys are burdened with stupidly huge student debt because your institutes has to charge you more money to accomodate these aliens.

You think these random Syrian can afford to pay that tuition?
Remove all funding from them.. Simple as that. These assholes need to learn about the law
I shelled out for a similarly hyped piece of paper. Feels bad man.
Any education institution that teaches kids (by example) that it's OK to break laws if you feel like it needs to be shut down.


Trump should send the deportation force into schools and arrest all Chacellors and presidents who harbor illegals/fugatives, which is a felony.
**SOMEONE COULD SEND A LIST OF THESE ILLEGALS TO ICE AFTER 1/20/16**

**THEY MIGHT DEPORT THEM IF ANY OF THESE PEOPLE COMMITED CRIMES**


 
Wait. Wait. If they're not citizens and are in one of the most expensive schools in the country, then who's paying their tuition?! Oh. I guess I am. 
Didn't they knowingly hire an undocumented American Indian as well.  #FauxCohontas
Get this to Tucker Carlson!
95% of people in academia are full of shit and massive cocksuckers that lie through their teeth and out their assholes at the same time.  This is another swamp that needs to be drained.
They've got about 50 days left 
Day 1:  Harvard President hauled off in handcuffs for immigration violations.  
  
"He was a modern day coyote smuggler, bringing in poor illegals and making them work at the university," said one anonymous student....
#HARBORING FUGITIVES
L.A.R.E.F.?
Does Harvard have a conservative association or a alumni you can contact? Anonymously? Tucker Carlson would be a great guy to tip off too. 

This is insane. 

Students pay top dollar for Harvard and they are exploring illegal labor  to save money. Or they are part of the system working to keep cheap labor in the US. 

I am amazed how far colleges have progressed since I went to school in CA. 
Tldr pls
Please tell me no illegal aliens are getting scholarships at our elite universities. 
#THEY ARE JUST SOUR THAT THEIR CANDIDATE FAILED#

But not only did Lessig fail, he is actively encouraging electors to vote against The Donald.

**barf**
Dukepede here (not exactly a student but a faculty), our school is giving psychological services to SJWs after the election, but didn't say anything about illegals. 

My friend who is currently a faculty at University of California got an email saying UC system will defend the benefit of illegals. 
In response to the statement in this email, it would be neat if a conservative student group would start a program to assist "undocumented" students in attaining citizenship or necessary visas to complete their education. 
WTF?!?  Apparently Harvard thinks it's the Vatican.
Thank God we have centipedes in Harvard, my childhood friend goes there and he's turned into a massive cuck.
I'd pass that along to ICE or the Trump administration... nonsense like this shouldn't happen!
My father was denied admission to Harvard Medical School because he was an Italian immigrant (legal) & they didn't even try to pretend that wasn't the reason. They flat-out tld him it was because if his nationality. He was admitted into their dental school, however, because dentists are second class, I guess. He was a damn fine dentist & served in WWII in the medical corps.
Harvard and Stanford are notorious for abusing the visa system and screwing over poor countries that foot the entire bill to send over students who promise to come back and make their universities better.  A lot of the time the university faculty pitches in for the insanely high tuition because the sponsor universities themselves can't afford it.  They all get stiffed, the student happily receives a PHD in a scientific field, and the country can't even extradite their citizen back for fraud because the American school protects the student.  Somehow.  Poor countries that are trying to raise the academic level of their country like Vietnam and Thailand get this the most.  The US treats those countries like they have zero rights as sovereign nations so they have no recourse so this is nothing new I guess.     

In any case, it's for cheap highly intelligent staff.   
Hey if be happy to make Harvard great again... If they agree to pay my tuition 
Too busy studying to read about current events themselves so must get huffpo cliff notes version

This has to be illegal in some way.
*Hillary supporter 
Since she said she was raising the money partly for a recount of PA, and she said it after the deadline for that recount, she may be guilty of fraud.

If she goes forward in PA with the alternate path of challenging the election process, she will need people to falsely swear they have strong evidence the election there was fraudulent.  They are liable to charges of perjury and she would be liable to suborning perjury.

This lady could be in a lot of trouble.

Barron will be SoS, but he's gotta be in bed by 10. 
Allison and Tulsi, fingers crossed.
I wasn't sure about Pence at first and was worried he was an establishment plant, but so far he seems to be very loyal and is doing a great job as Trump's right hand man/Hand of the King. I like Mike.

Great job officer 
Incoming Black Lives Matter protests against this guy for terrorizing the black community.
Trump should give this Hero a call and congratulate him on his great and fast service.

I bet he does.
I'm waiting for the fake news outlets to spin this into "While male with a gun shoots poor innocent muslim on college campus after muslim has minor car accident".
Worst terrorist killing spree ever!

> ‚ÄúThere is a continuing cycle of these sorts of things. They serve the same purpose: to intimidate individuals from speaking plainly in their classrooms or in their publications.‚Äù

That's exactly what leftists are doing!! Once again, the left displays its fetish for taking whatever it is they are actually doing to someone else and accusing someone else of doing it.

> ‚ÄúIn the past, I have taken the position that we ignore such challenges to free speech and the hate mail that usually accompanies it, but no longer,‚Äù Professor Neuberger said. ‚ÄúNow I say we fight as hard as we can against people who don‚Äôt care about accuracy, who can‚Äôt recognize fake news and who seek to monitor what we do as educators.‚Äù

That has got to be a joke. It HAS to be. I'm nearly speechless at their incessant hypocrisy.

But question--how is this really any different from like RateMyProfessor? Oh, because it's *conservatives* reporting their observations in the classrooms they pay thousands of dollars to be in, just like other students. Why did I bother to ask? So, what are these bigotphobes complaining about, asks the lefty propagandist? Let's see:

> ... professor at Washington State University. In her ‚ÄúIntroduction to Comparative Ethnic Studies‚Äù class, Fowler takes one grade point away anytime a student uses the phrase ‚Äúillegal alien‚Äù or ‚Äúillegals.‚Äù The goal is that students will ‚Äú**come to recognize how white privilege** functions in everyday social structures and institutions.‚Äù

Look, that is ACTUALLY RACIST. You cannot treat white students like that just because your batshit crazy and inconsistent ideology decrees that the only remaining group you can openly hate without criticism happens to be white people. If I were white I would fucking sue if my university didn't put a stop to that shit.

> ... Professor of Philosophy at Santa Monica College. Dr. Katherine led students in an ‚ÄúEcoSexual Sextravaganza‚Äù in which participants ‚Äúmarried the ocean.‚Äù After the ceremony, she encouraged students to make their way to the shoreline to ‚Äúconsummate‚Äù the marriage and ‚Äúmake love with the water.‚Äù 

If this were something I could not decline without a penalty to my grade, I would report that shit too because my religious beliefs would compel me to associate this with pagan idolatry and defamation of marriage. 

Suck it, radical lefties. If you refuse to allow conservative voices alongside yours, you deserve to get silenced too. Report ALL the things!

The fake news floated "soul searching" for a bit but I don't see it.  I don't want to join a blob of hodge podge cultures with no distinctiveness. I want AMERICAN culture to survive not get gobbled up by people who don't understand it nor respect it.  If you come to the America and do not add to its greatness you are doing it wrong. Assimilation is key. 

[MAGA!](https://youtu.be/PX34C1Mq9kc)
If Fidel Castro were your hero, you would respect the left.

Otherwise, no.
Never had any
As an ex-vegan, ex-anarchist fruit bat.. nah, I lost my respect for the left back around 1999.
I never much liked their positions and the condescention when I disagreed, but now, after reading comment after comment all over the place about how those of us in middle america and those of us who voted Trump are uneducated rubes, they're dead to me.

I have to say, the reaction of liberals, even those I know personally, has disgusted me greatly.  I don't consider many of them as friends anymore.  You can't claim to be a good person and then spit vile commentary about anybody who disagrees with you.

But, you know, MAGA, so it's all good.
Well.  I'm a progressive.  I'm here, and I support the God Emporer now.  Are there really these extremist lefties or is it more (dis)information to divide us?
the left are communist scammers
I used to respect them when Bernie was in the Democratic primaries, and I was rooting for Bernie (before being redpilled way prior to the election, of course). But the redpill started to take effect when I watched a college republican panel with Milo, a Canadian comedian and a feminist (don't remember the last 2 names, sorry).

Watching that and seeing the libtards rudely interrupting the panel and beyond biased to feminism and BLM, to where even the moderate feminist on the panel cringed.

At first I had no idea that feminism had ties to democrats until I saw more of them going towards Shillary and Bernie "The Cuck" Sanders. I believe when I saw that Bernie didn't do refunds and bought a house was the last straw for me.

After the election, I saw a lot of my "friends" true colors after the God Emperor was triumphant, seeing all the "remove me if you support Trump" and saying "Police are the problem", what have you. And I see parts of my family saying "Trump is bad!" which is ironic because they follow Occupy Democrats.

When it comes to family, I'll remain silent because they're WAY too stubborn, and also I don't want to be "disowned" or "blacklisted".

TL;DR: Used to support a cuck until the redpill started after he bought a house, some family members are liberals, and the election showed true colors of "friends".
I can't say I have. 

But that's only because I don't think I had any for them before this.    
The Marxist left, but I have newfound respect for the Liberal left.
never had any!
There are decent freethinkers among the left but a lot of them crossed over and voted for Trump.  If the left doesn't shape up and figure things out, more of them will.  
Never had respect for them.
What we should start doing is going after the handwringing journalists and writers who are white and rant at them about their white privilege. They truly believe they get a pass because they are "speaking up" like they're some kind of intermediaries for minorities who can't think for themselves. They don't see anything patronizing at all. I say delegitimize their input by saying they can't possibly know anything as a white person.  Then they do either have to admit that they can't say anything about minorities or they will self-flagellate to the point of ridiculousness. Either way they should not be getting away with their virtue signaling.
I have hated them since 2008.

That was year I decided I should know something about politics.  

The difference in coverage I saw between McCain and Obama red pilled the fuck out of me.

The savage attacks on Sara Palin red pilled the fuck out of me.


The sheer retardation of the media and the voters believing this no name Senator who had never had a real job or done any real work was a good choice for President floored me.

The absolute cock gobbling that has followed over the last 8 years has cemented that feeling.

The left are stupid children and there is no hope for them.

They are very thin skinned over there, perhaps the following articles pasted below, were on to something:

I think it's because the majority of redditors lean left. Plus, the moderators of those subreddits are big liberals and they delete/block/ban anything pro-Trump.
Don't go to r/politics unless you are searching to have an aneurism. I have a very good back ground and experience in foreign affairs and I had a goner studies cuck tell me I was wrong about US Russian relations. I have dual citizenship sooo...... it's a cesspool in those subreddits and I wouldn't doubt if they had bots posting information all the time. The more Trump wins the more they will hate you, FACT!
Oh yeah, /r/politics is more of an echo chamber of liberal regressive left groupthink. They used to be fair way before the election but now they're too far gone to recover 
Welcome to the domreddit. Thou art no subreddits greater than this sub. Trump maketh us lie down in green pastures and shitpost.
I'd say because Reddit leans left in general and they're default subreddits so it just attracts the intended audience for Reddit at large.

smooth.
There is not a single sentence in that letter that doesn't scream "fake".
And even in that shitfest of a failed false flag, "He is also xenophobic" still sticks out like a sore thumb.

No one on the right would ever use the term xenophobic, it is an insult used by the left to imply that your dislike for specific foreigners is not just a dislike but a fear, and even worse than that, an irrational fear.

Do you have a .pdf or .docx file of that letter? 
FUCK Don the üçã I cringe watching that butt plug
He's such a schill. His talent is keeping a straight face with all the biased bullshit that spews out of his mouth.
Someone in Ohio get this man laid tonight. It only takes two of you to give him a threesome. Food for thought.
I think we should also express concern for this officer's wellbeing, post taking another human being's (if murderous and criminal) life.  A tough situation to be put in.  Hope he will be ok.
My man is gonna get death threats for being a decent person and saving lives. The media is fucking *disgusting* for trying to portray him as the bad guy.
GET THIS MAN A COAT

Straight White Male! Feminists retreat now ! This is the future for America! Fuck the SJW!
Good man right there.
American strength!  Patriot!
Anyone know the origin of his last name?  Sounds Japanese, but...

SPEZ:  Finally typed it right into google and it looks like maybe Austria.
Hell, I'd let him grab my pussy.  
Excellent work Patriot. 
>Savage has documented his battle over the ban in his book ‚ÄúBanned in Britain,‚Äù which includes official correspondence, released under the U.K.‚Äôs freedom-of-information law, that reveals a **decision was made at the highest level of government to use his name to provide ‚Äúbalance‚Äù to a ‚Äúleast wanted‚Äù list dominated by Muslim extremists.**

They banned Michael Savage because they had to ban so many radical Muslim terrorists that it looked too "lopsided" to not have a white conservative on the ban list.
Freedom of speech. That's all.
Hey, that's not Abu Hamza Al-Masri
Any he's the first host to jump off the Trump train because Trump picked Rince
"Bernie's a schmendrick."
Make sure to grab the president Trump versions when they're out, Centipede! Need to keep the triggering up to date. 
/u/spez is such a cool guy though. Please buy Reddit Gold.
Thanks for posting this. I was out of the loop and had no idea what the renewed hate of spez was for.
Caught editing posts twice.

That we know of. 

Sort of makes me wonder what else he might have edited.

Censorship is the reason I joined reddit been ghosting T_D this whole cycle finally couldn't take #MSM biased shut no more, & T_D is the only place I was able to find uncensored news.

The T_D proved CTR was real, so I'm on a mission to counter troll these paid shills & all those commies that voted for that spirit cooking, criminal hybitual lair killer clinton, Trump train 2016
Rather *7 years ago*. Kind of a dick move to alter the headline like this.
They need to out that guy.
I wonder what the title of this post will be 7 years from now.  
Editing people's posts is so very unethical. I can see it lending to a fucking mental breakdown.
I looked up spez in the dictionary and it says "part time fag, full time pedo"
/u/spez would never do such a thing, he's a super trusted and all-round nice guy! Just look at this comment, clearly unedited!

Remember to buy Reddit Gold!
Editing transparently is one thing. Without transparency is another. 

I used to admin a medium sized forum and had to edit a users post once. It was for some extreme language in direct contravention of the forum policies. My edits were obvious and noted. 
Very interesting read.

I cannot verify that this comment is as I typed it, thanks to /u/spez doing some editing.
Drain the swamp!
This needs to stop, immediately. 
There is a video on FOX right now that talks about u/spez and says that there is no real proof of Pizzagate.  They must not have read the Podesta emails very well!!

#The Year of Seven. Praise KEK.
And if they're editing comments, why should we believe they're not fucking with upvotes and downvotes too?
Dude, can't handle it!  Winning overdrive!
