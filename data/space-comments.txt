Does anyone know what the Russians refer to as "napthyl"? I'm skimming through the annual report of their UDMH producer in Salavat and seeing references to an RP-1 drop-in replacement fuel.
Do you have any quick references, pics or facts to absolutely shut down any 'flat earther' person instantaneously. She is driving me insane 
What's to stop a private company from slapping together an efficient EM drive (now that they appear to work) strapping it onto a small craft. throwing in a bunch of test equipment (i.e. telescopes and spectrometers and HD cameras) and firing that thing out towards Alpha Centauri?  
  
We could take crazy good measurements of stuff on the way as well!
I know this is a very basic question but I guess that's what this thread is for.

How do astronauts get onto the ISS? It's travelling at the best part of 30,000km/h. I cannot fathom how they'd get on and off that thing.

Is it a case of the craft used to get them there going at exactly the same speed so it's relatively straightforward to 'connect' the two? I just think there must be much more to it.

Thanks!
Lets say a company like spacex is spending billions a year on R and D. I understand stuff like interstellar travel is far off but what are the chances that the company discovers something that we have not discovered yet? Is this possible or is it just wishful thinking? I really want to see interstellar travel in my lifetime and be able to participate in space tourism.
How come we cannot find the rumored "9th Planet" of our solar system, yet we have found millions of exoplanets?

^(I've seen 7 acronyms in this thread, which is the most I've seen in a thread so far today.)  
[^\[Acronym ^lists\]](http://decronym.xyz/) [^\[Contact ^creator\]](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=OrangeredStilton&subject=Hey,+your+acronym+bot+sucks) [^\[PHP ^source ^code\]](https://gist.github.com/Two9A/1d976f9b7441694162c8)
Questions about strange stars, metallic stars, neutrino stars and black holes

I recently came to understand stars better due to various reasons including wikipedia blitzes, and always understood a strange star to have strange quarks and knew of strange matter's weird ability to pack differently due to learning about strange nuclei 

now there is mention of strange stars being a late stage of neutrons stars where up/down quarks get transformed into some strange matter, to lower potential energy, never considered that and with my newer interest in the mechanics that drive stars (mass versus pressure and relieving pressure by converting matter) 

I have also hear mention to stars being pure EM force-matter a some scale. 

but my question is, at what point would quark translation equal a density close to a black hole, and could we use this to determine the end of the quark generations ? (ie are top and bottom the end ) and could the use of this knowledge and the idea that a neutron star may pass through numerous instantaneous conversions to heavier matter forms from the primitive times, just as it's iron core flashes through yet unknown heavy elements before hitting some outright crash point, be used to determine the nature of the early universe and all matter from the EMR produced?

If you had a large enough pure iron core could you reach a new fusion epoch? or is that age a rapid explosive one towards a neutron star? or would it merely explode as dust (H/He) tunnels through the iron because of the massive energy potential driving it to the center where it ignites and becomes a star? 

Neutrino mass is apparently insignificant in the universe but they must slowly form flows as they weakly interact with one another, would it be possible for them to form stars? 

If a star, possible a quark star, whatever quarks actually are that they compose matter at specific ratios, what should a black hole burn/convert? gluons? bosons? some force modulator we don't know that determines some factor of spacetime?

Question about the EM Drive. My friend claims that as long as it produces thrust via any method, then its all good. He reads nothing but presumes he knows everything.

I on the other hand have read everything I can find on this, and I'm trying to explain the difference between what's hoped for, and any anomalies in the measurements due to thermal radiation or whatever.

He's claiming "whatever way it produces thrust, [be it via microwaves or thermal radiation - my wording] it still works better than other methods like solar sails or ion drives".

Q1: Who's right?

Q2: If it does produce thrust via thermal radiation, would this actually work as a viable propulsion method, and not degrade the "engine" over time, due to photon/heat or whatever? 
Would human beings be able to see nebulae as they look in pictures? I've noticed people take pictures of space objects like the Orion Nebula through hours of exposure.

While the images are highly detailed, would a human being as far as a few light years in space ever be able to look at these objects with the same level of clarity?
This is probably the least smartest question on here, but why are galaxies shaped differently? Is it a cause of different gravity? Different ways they were created? 
I just recently heard about Elon Musk's idea of nuking Mars to bring back it's atmosphere. How does this work? Is it feasible?
I found this article from 2006:

https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10512-astronauts-to-pitch-unwanted-gear-off-space-station/

about throwing/launching trash "backward" from the space station to let atmospheric drag slowly deorbit the trash.  Did they decide to actually do this?   

Also, how about something like a sailboat "drift anchor" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_anchor ) to help drag the trash down?
About rockets that put satellites in orbit around Earth: Do all engines of the rocket return themselves to sub-orbital trajectories after putting satellites in orbit, or do the satellites put themselves into orbit from a sub-orbital trajectory?

And remaining in the discussion of possible space junk: How many of the engines for Mars-capture missions end up as space junk? If they do not end up as space junk, where do we crash the engines?
is there a possibility that mars is currently in a phase similar to a snowball earth, in which some point in the future it could get warmer?
If gravity to the centre of the earth is 9.8ms^(2), what is the gravity (ignoring the moon) acceleration towards the Sun, and what is the gravity (ignoring the Sun) acceleration towards the Moon?
If a [Supermoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon) is when the moon passes close to Earth during a "Full Moon", then what is the name of the event when the moon passes close to Earth during a "New Moon"?
If you think about it, the moon landing happened in part due to politics.  The US had to beat the Russians after they sent the first human to space.  I think that the Government should still fund NASA as well as encourage any and all initiatives in the private sector.  As a species, we must become space-fairing or we will die off.  It's just a matter of time.
When Europeans decided to get the hell outa dodge and explore the world, they were private merchants, sanctioned and partially funded by their monarchs. Is it time for NASA, JPL, etc.. to be dismantled over time and let the private companies with government oversight to take over our next steps in the solar system exploration?

It just seems that political bureaucracy has constantly gotten in the way since the last moon landing.

I think one of the craziest things about images like this is that the camera is a masterpiece of engineering. It goes from one temperature extreme to another every hour. The math on all the part's thermal expansion is amazing.
I claim this hill in the name of the Queen, i will call it Little Britain hill
Cool, puts the nail in the coffin of water being on mars, no evidence of that at all here!
Would that happen to be from [the one in Amarillo a while back](http://i.imgur.com/w37linS.gifv)?
Yoooooo can someone explain why and how this happens to a non-science person? 
"Steven how many times do i have to tell you, do not fucking summon that thing in my house."
Well, now that Calamity is in orbit, it's only a matter of time until we start seeing Epics.
Wow, those things are a lot bigger than I thought from reading about them. I hope I see one someday.
That is absolutely incredible! It's so rare to see these Photographed as you need *just the right* conditions to even see them, let alone have them occur!

Helluva shot. These don't last long either. Really get a feel for the size of those things with this shot!

When I'm bored I go over to r/theworldisflat to read the crazy shit people post, so this makes me smile. Dat curve tho. 
I never knew that red sprites were so large. I just assumed they were quite small features. 
TX, OK, and Northern Mexico is pictured in this. You can see the RGV, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Austin, DFW, Houston, Midland, Odessa, Lubbock, Laredo, OKC, Tulsa, Monterrey, and I believe El Paso, under the clouds. 
At the bottom of the picture, is that a reflection of the moon on the ocean? If so that is *awe*some, it's funny how the reflection appears the same size from space as it does when leading on a pond, puddle, lake, etc. 
Soviet cosmonauts used to use the code "I am observing thunderstorms" to signify that their craft was experiencing problems, the only problem was thunderstorms looks amazing from orbit, this led to some perfectly functional missions almost being aborted before the cosmonaut clarified what they meant.
Is that the moon just above the horizon?
The city lights look a bit blurry while the stars seem sharp. What is causing that? The atmosphere?
I keep forgetting that Sprite isn't just a soda. Click baited from my ignorance.
Haha, wow; I'm subscribed to /r/flightsim and I thought this was a picture from there, so I closed it almost immediately. I had to do a double-take.
I'm more of a classic sprite guy. I mean red sprite is good but you can't beat lemon lime!
Can someone tell me how photoshopped that picture is? Or is that more or less close to reality? 
All of that light pollution drives me crazy.  It's nothing but a waste.  Were trying to illuminate space.... 
i only recently found out about sprites...ridiculously gorgeous phenomenon.  mother nature is lit
A physics teacher once told us these sprites can appear seemingly randomly. Ball lightning.
Oh Oh Oh, Can anybody tell me what region this is taken above, aka what cities are we looking at? I know!!!! but do you?
Here is a hint: I does seem to be night, and there are a lot of large and luminous stars above this region. 
This is the beginning of the UNIVERSAL PICTURES intro in the movies 
I was honestly expecting something like [this](http://www.bevreview.com/wp-content/image_sprite_cranberry_can_official1.jpg)
Kind of unrelated, but what's the green circular curve?  I assume it's the atmosphere or some layer of it, but why does it appear to get thicker the further away from earth?  Is that an effect of the light or a result of the atmosphere's composition?  What's the significance of the outer border?
I was kind of expecting to see a 20oz. Red Sprite bottle in space before opening the picture. This is good though.
That is a cool picture. I`ve never seen a picture of this phenomenon in context   like this before; thank you. 
They should make a red sprite. Like sprite with a hint of cherry flavor or perhaps raspberry sprite 
http://imgur.com/xjREGqi I'm pretty sure it's a floating head. Definitely not a sprite...
Obviously a fake image, the sun isn't even yellow! Wake up sheeple!



THIS IS SATIRE
This is a beautiful shot! Fancy also submitting it to r/PlanetEarth?
What is the distance between the surface of the earth and the green line in this picture
This reminds me of a documentary about thunderstorms I saw a long time ago. It had a strong emphasis on how you can see a red 'flash' from space moments before lighting would strike. Can't remember the name but if anyone knows this phenomenon, please elaborate!
Anyone have any theories on what the gold streaking in the top right is? 
This is a stupid question, but are the light splotches in the top right corner, reflections?
Don't tell me it's sprite when it's really Sierra Mist. I can tell the difference!
Are those big cities Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio? Looking toward the east? 
wait wait wait so you're telling me. that that red claw looking portal is a sprite. I'm telling you the other are coming to take our jobs.
I tried to clean my laptop screen of dust to see better, turns out it was the cosmos.
>Red Sprite

Oh, like that manga that replaced Bleach and got cancelled after 2 months
In all of the infinite universe I bet there's some group like guardians of the galaxy just rolling about up there
So question that yellow thing around earth is our atmosphere right? Is that visible to the human eye or only with pictures?
The pattern reminds me of the interference pattern from the double slit experiment. Is there any relation?
Seems like it's the first time games produce higher res and clearer photos of planets than an astronaut with a space camera
Does gas composition in the atmosphere change at different altitudes? Being from a chemist background.  Electrons becoming excited from the energy transferred causes them to emit different wavelengths of light. Like different metals used in fireworks to produce different colors.  The sky is blue because of the hydrogen so maybe different types of gas in higher presence causes difference colors of light?
How are stars so close to the sun/moon thing visible when the light is supposed to make everything look dark as seen in most pictures?
The real question is can you hear when this happens cause one day I was watching a thunderstorm that sent a bolt across the sky like way up there with a very loud bang but instead of rumbling after it just started doing this static spiting type noise like the sound was just bottoming out for like 4 seconds and I would love to be able to say "O there was a ELF riding that one" they only come out for the radical high altitude storms. How do I get reddit to answer my questions?

Edit: Can you hear a ELF!
[Some of them look like deep sea squid or something Lovecraftian emerging from the void.](http://www.livescience.com/images/i/000/003/143/original/090611-jellyfish-sprite-02.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&fit=inside%7C660:*)
Wait a sec I thought real photos taken in space don't show star light in the background.

Is this like a photo taken while still in a layer of the atmosphere?
So it's not a pirate turning the world upside down and returning from the world's end? 
There was a subreddit for atmospheric phenomena like this. What was it called again?
Wouldn't it just be like plasma similar to how putting a match in a microwave works? 
the fact that we have a photo of this is incredible. meanwhile we kill each other and create memes [8]
I'm more of a 7-up above a black light of a passive thunderstorm type of guy. 

None-the-less great shot coming from someone who does "okay" photography from the ground floor up. 
I love seeing these pictures, things that were only posited to exist but had no document ability my entire life suddenly in front of me. 

Maybe I just haven't kept reading enough but wouldn't they make sense that lightning is both grounded at the ground and on the edge of our (magnetosphere? Ionosphere?) making a circuit of sorts?  Please excuse my absolute lack of formal knowledge. Just can't seem to confirm or put this one to rest that I know of. 
Thats definitely an A/H Bomb with that whitish light over on the left side. What else could it be.
So which paragon of Reddit already figured out what part of the world this is? I'll grant you one arrow-shaped virtual high-five
Sorry if I missed this, but where did this picture come from?  What camera took it?
Might be late on this, but curious, would a human still see the city/man-made lights from space as well as in this pic? I've always wondered if those pictures of Earth at night are really what someone in space would see or if it's really just dark to the human eye.
It's one of my dreams to ever see one in real life. Which is nearly impossible considering the chances and the short duration of the flashes. 
How was this photo taken? What I'm thinking is that I had thought red sprites were faint, and city lights are quite bright, so pretty amazing to me you can see both in the same photo.

Everything NASA and you science nerds know about space is wrong. 
Looks like lens flare to me. Light from the moon reflecting inside the camera lenses. 
Curious word used to describe it - Sprite.  I like to believe, that for a brief moment, these sprites are alive, self-aware, and only have enough time to experience the immediate end of their existence.

[Word cloud out of all the comments.](http://i.imgur.com/kfLG27c.png)

I hope you like it
Hey you should be careful with the term sprite. As a gamer I was intrigued by your post when I saw it in /r/all but was disappointed when it wasn't about video games. Just a heads up to make reddit better for all of us.
The human body is pretty much a sealed container and it would take a while for atrophy to set in Ina vacuum. How long could a human last in a vacuum if they had a pressurized and closed-door sealed oxygen mask.
Hero really for putting himself at such great risk, the faked moon landings would never have happened otherwise
There is gravity on the moon, just not nearly as much as on earth. The sand not falling immediately is more evidence that it IS in space. 
Star trek away missions would have been more fun in low gravity.

 Oh shit I dropped my tricorder. 

Ensign do you detect any life signs. 

just a second captain...two steps back and jump kneel...dam it... Just like in training.....ballocks...one more time

Ensign those readings.

Aaaaa there is to much interferon radiation to get a reading one sec I will try to compensate.... and jump kneel.... great now I have fallen and can't get up..... Enterprise one emergency beam up
I'm left handed, but seeing people do things left handed looks so awkward. Especially in space.
Haha I laughed so hard... 

I'm sure he didn't get this at training.

NASA 101 picking up the hammer ( Aka Hammertime )
Why he didn't just made a "push-up" on both hands? I guess he can fall down on 2 hands, pick up the hammer and then push himself up to standing position (I think it should be possible since lower gravity).
What about grappling the pole to pull himself down? Looks driven in enough to be sturdy to hold.
I'll never be able to think of the Apollo missions again without thinking about Sheila Jackson-Lee asking to see where the flag was planted when viewing video from the Mars rover.
This is like when you don't feel like diving in a pool to pick up something that sunk so you try to bend down 
You can almost hear Kubrick yelling "cut! Back your places. Dammit man I'm gonna glue that hammer to your hands!"
There is no gravity on the moon, how did that hammer stop so quickly? Shouldn't the sand also float around after kicking it up? Just wondering.

I don't think the USSR/(Russia?) gets enough credit for how perfect Soyuz was engineered.
How does Soyuz handle cold weather? Wasn't that a huge issue for the Shuttle?
Wow. Those bright pretty colors poking through the snow is beautiful. Looks like something out of a video game.

Remove the people and I envision this as a scene from rocket town in ff7... with snow
Soyuz flies to space station in blizzard.  

Meanwhile we have major pile up on hwy in 2" of snow. 
am I the only one that thinks this looks exactly like that scene in FF VII
Possibly my favourite space related photo I've ever seen on reddit.
I automatically assumed that was Trimethoxyamphetamine-22.  Then I realized it was a rocket.
Given how far away Venus is from the Sun, this really gives some perspective on how huge the Sun actually is. Venus is the body closest to Earth in size. Dayum space, you big.
A much better version, including several other different wavelengths of imaging from that spacecraft/telescope can be found in [the NASA Goddard video of the event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z9rM8ChTjY).

To clear up some confusion I see in the comments.... images like this are looking at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission from the Sun, so when Venus ([or Mercury](http://mercurytransit.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) transit the face of the Sun, they block that emission and so they look black. In some places you might see it described as the "shadow" of the planet crossing the Sun, but that's a misleading description - it is the planet itself you're seeing. 

The spacecraft itself (NASA [Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) is in Earth's orbit, so to a good approximation you can say these images were taken from Earth.
Over what period of time is this video captured?

Would it be right to say that this would be half of Venus' orbital period? Any good sources for reading up about the transit?
This terrifies me. And to think, the sun is small compared to other stars.
I'm excited because it feels like we are almost in the video era of space exploration.

In the beginning we only got pictures, but now after the use of timlapse and capturing events as they happen I can finally see those stills animated into a much more comprehensive and graspable perspective.

The original one was taken by the Apollo 17 crew on Dec 7, 1972 at a distance of about 45,000 kilometers (28,000 mi). Second one was taken by the DSCOVR satellite on Nov 29, 2016, at a distance of about 1,400,000 km (875,000 mi)
Is there a defining difference I should be looking for? They look the same to me except for the top one's superior lighting.
Quite literally the Circle of Life.

How much as the resolution went up in that time? and just as an aside, do photographs have an "absolute distance" that they can zoom?
Photoshop. Horizon too blue. Sun is white, not yellow. Can't see stars due to Sun's brightness.
Earth from photoshop. You can tell by the pixels. 

Basically, if you can see the stars and the sun at the same time, you know the picture has been doctored.
I like how they used a fish-eye lense to make it look like earth isn't flat.

While it may not be a real picture, its pretty damn close and looks really good.
I don't really care if it's fake or not it's only relevant based on the subreddit you posted it in. A more appropriate place for posts like these in the future is under r/EarthPorn. Cheers!
Silly.  The earth is flat.  Anyone with a...well...no education could tell you that.
Couldn't you go outside, and take a picture of the ground, and say its "Earth from space" and be correct?

That's correct right? A picture, of earth, from space. Not outer or inner space, but space.
This reminds me of the earth-themed music visualisation on the PS3. Hot dang I wish they'd bring that over to PS4, as a dashboard theme or something.
Where were you when the space shuttle Columbia accident happened?     
     
I was sitting at home waiting for coverage to start on CNN. I got up to make a snack so I could settle in front of the TV and wait for their arrival, when I heard my dad say "Oh my God" and called me back to the living room. I looked at the screen and it was filled with meteor-like streaks. After watching the replays a few more times, I went to my bedroom and wept. 
I was camping with my Boy Scout troop at Snow Canyon State Park in southern Utah. The previous day we had been working on our knot tying merit badge. We created a 10 ft tall tower out of wood poles tied together at the joints to demonstrate our knowledge and the strength of knots. We got up early and all climbed onto this tower  to see the shuttle streak across the southern sky. The sonic boom was unlike anything I had ever heard. Such a surreal experience, made even more so upon hearing of its disintegration later that day. 
I was in 2nd grade and my school arranged for all the classrooms to gather in the gymnasium, where we all sat in rows on the floor, to watch the first teacher go up in space on a big projector screen. 

I don't remember my reaction when it actually happened but I remember clearly filing into the gymnasium and then afterwards our teacher saying that our guidance counselor was available to talk to anyone who felt they needed to. I don't know if I went into shock or what. I don't remember anything in between. 
And to think that it had less computer processing ability than a modern smartphone.

Is there any realistic ways to Terraform  mars?

The actual future of Mars
http://i.imgur.com/UsU2D8i.png
If it's true the planets are moving away from the sun this image would represent the past, right?  
How come most terraformed depictions of Mars only have an ocean in the Northern hemisphere? Isn't there a significant amount of water at the southern pole? 
Mars is like Earth's *back up* incase anything really bad happens.

What could possibly go wrong on this blissful planet to make us want to leave?

:rhetorical sarcasm, blast off
Correction: That is what Mars will look like after we crash Europa into it.
I've been playing an app called TerraGenesis, where you terraform planets like this. It's early days (I think it's just one guy working on it) but it has great potential. Took me a week to terraform the moon, but looked pretty cool afterwards.
Not sure if it would look this warm. The temperature would still be Mars temperatures, at least to some degree (no pun intended, but now that I see it, pun intended).
I don't fault people for using their imaginations to dream of possibilities and such for extending life beyond our planet but sometimes I feel like we as humans have our priorities all over the place. 

We have a perfectly good planet right beneath our feet that we and the rest of the living/non-living organisms that inhabit it have become adapted to for long stretches of time. The Sun and Earth give 
us literally everything we need to survive without expecting anything in return and what do we do? 

Burn harmful petro-chemicals releasing them into the atmosphere, ravage the natural world for finite resources, destroy ecosystems through hunting/fishing/farming, dump harmful by products back into the environment and continue to take up more and more of everything while doing little to protect what we do have/educate people about the natural world.

Not to mention as a species we have yet to learn how to coexist with each other and the natural world around us. It's all very sad, but maybe that is the central fallacy of mankind. We have all the ability and insight into becoming stewards of a world that we can collectively manage for the advancement of our lives and all living creatures around us yet we allow greed and commerce to dictate how we live... 

Just offering my own insight into these areas...
A perhaps possible future for Mars. This would also require humans not to destroy themselves in the next few thousand years. An increasingly unlikely possibility. 
I think that by the time we get good enough at manipulating comets and asteroids to terraform Mars we won't be worried about catastrophic asteroids anymore.
So... which planets make the most sense to mush together so there is enough mass the resulting blob of debris can eventually be called a habitable planet with a magnetic field?
It also helps if you don't include any information (or source) about the photo other than "An astronaut on the Moon."

What is the dark gray spiral thing in the photo just below and to the left of the Cosmonaut?
Neurosurgery resident here. We already have surgeries for treating the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by other conditions. Classically, we use a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, which basically shunts CSF from the brain to the abdomen via a tube that runs under the skin. It's a very common procedure that we do that may be used to prevent this condition if we set a valve that could consistently shunt an appropriate amount of CSF while the astronaut is in space.
This article makes me kinda sad. 

Hopefully somebody much smarter than I can figure out a way around the vision loss and brain damage from long term space flight.
I feel like this is a prime example of how dangerous space is. It will take than a few rockets and wishfull thinking to truely survive,  every caution must be accomadated for.
We really need to start developing space shuttles and stations meant to rotate for simulated gravity. I am still very surprised we are still doing months of weightlessness.
You could make artificial gravity through rotating the ship to create a centrifugal force. 
The source article - [Moscow Times] (https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/russia-falls-behind-us-and-china-in-annual-space-launches-for-first-time-ever-56344) - has since been corrected:

>"Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported, as Roscosmos did, that 2016 is the first year Russia fell behind the U.S. in launches. In fact, the Soviet Union was initially behind the U.S. from about 1957 to 1967, and briefly again during the late 1990s."

Still pretty cool though. 
I like the fact that Orion nebula is clear as hell in this picture. I'm always more amused by the nebula than the Orion itself
In all seriousness this will end up being like the X prizes where the prize received is largely ceremonial compared to the money spent developing something. 

This is a COMPLICATED problem. Getting solid waste away from someone's body without the use of their own hands and in a zero-g environment inside a suit... that is super complicated. 
Well for example if we decided to colonize Mars, those people born and living on the planet might not do so well on Earth. Their bones would be much weaker than an earthling. One of the biggest challenges is the change in atmosphere and gravity. 
What the heck is "Rigil"? Same thing as Rigel?

> "The group aims to decide which traditional star names from cultures around the world are the official ones, in order to avoid confusion," the IAU said in the statement.

Mission not accomplished.
In order to reduce confusion, we've decided to do something very confusing.
Me: [tells people to suck it up and accept the IAU's classification of Pluto]

Also me: "you bastards, it'll always be Alpha Centauri to me!" 
If Alpha Centuri and Proxima Centuri are a binary pair, how is Proxima always closer to Earth?
The IAU has made a list of "official" names for some stars, but these stars still have designations in other catalogs/systems.  Alpha Centauri is still Alpha Centauri if you're going by Bayer designation.  The [IAU article](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/) releasing the new "official" names still has the Bayer/Flamsteed designations as the first columns in their table.  You can chose whichever system to refer to a star that you want.
They avoided confusion in the same way of that occasion when they decided that some large round objects orbiting the Sun are *definitely not* planets and named them... "dwarf planets".

I'm starting to think that the IAU is some sort of troll cabal.
dumbest thing ever...it is Alpha Centauri, and that is what it's gonna be forever.
In another development, the International Astronomical Union has been renamed to "A Bunch of Mindless Jerks Who'll Be The First Against The Wall When The Revolution Comes".
Why don't we rename Sagittarius A*, the supermassive blackhole in the center of the Milky Way? Every time I say the name in my head I immediately think, "But its not a star". How about Chronus?
Yeah. I'm just going to go ahead and keep calling it Alpha Centauri 
I actually like this particular change, 'Epsilon Eridani' is now 'Ran'. Much less of a mouthful.
Proportionally, the oceans are just a very thin film of water. Oceans are many thousands of kilometers across but only a couple of kilometers deep. Imagine it more like a layer of paint.
This is a good representation of how the volume of a sphere scales. 

It looks likes the diameter of the large sphere ( I'm guessing large is all the salt water and small is all the fresh? ) is about half the width of the USA, which is about 3000km across. Volume of a sphere with diameter 1500 km is 1.76x10^21 liters. 

Wolfram Alpha lists volume of the oceans as 1.33x10^21  
The key is the comparison to Earth.  Earth's radius is about 4,000 miles.  The deepest parts of the oceans are about 7 miles.  So even if the entire Earth had water 7 miles deep (not just the ocean parts but including the continents) that's still 7 / 4000 = 0.00175, so 0.175% of the radius of Earth would be water.

Volume is cubic, so that magnifies the difference in size as we can see.
The picture is a bit misleading but accurate.  It's hard to show exactly how big the ball of water (how many miles the circumference is) is in relation to the earth.  The picture originates from the usgs.gov website with other information.
Here: http://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthhowmuch.html
I heard the comparison one time that if the earth were the size of a globe, the distance from the tip of Everest to the lowest point of the Marianas Trench would only be as tall as peaks and valleys of your fingerprints. Didn't do any math to see if it worked out, but it at least puts the general topography of earth, and thus the amount of water on earth, into a scale that can be easily understood
Isn't there more water at the bottom on the ocean per cubic meter than at the top due to the immense pressure? 
I could be preparing to personally deorbit the ISS potentially in the next 50 years.
This is my shocked face. I'd say let's focus on space exploration before space combat, but where's the fun in that?
jay... we found water on a planet that cannot create new water... let's use it until there is nothing left.
A Post Detection Protocol (PDP) exists, and is somewhat thorough.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-detection_policy?wprov=sfla1
1) Be afraid of dead alien bodies

2) Put face close to alien cobra thing

3) ???

4) Release alien terror upon exploration party crewmates
Pretty sure there is a basic how to guide on first contact that got released awhile.back 

I'm sure it's been upgraded since 
Do you mean discovery of any life at all? Or contact with sentient life? 
There is a NASA and UN planetary protection protocol made in 1967. It isn't about the breaking of news, but requirements for rover sterilization and the directive that all exploration stops as soon as any life form is found or definitely detected.  
  
>According to a 1967 United Nations treaty, countries should "conduct exploration of [planets] so as to avoid their harmful contamination." That's why Mars rovers, including Curiosity, are carefully cleaned before being launched to avoid taking microbes from Earth into outer space.   
  
We are living in the Age of Announcements For Announcements. Finding any kind of life not from Earth would be the biggest announcement of announcements. It probably depends on whether the discovery is of a microbe or a reptilian Martian having gone totally underground for 60 million years walking up to Curiosity and taking a selfie with it.
Microbial/very simple lifeforms, yeah probably gonna be made public

Intelligent life forms we can communicate with, most likely we won't hear about it.
On top of what's already been said, remember the leaks over the Higgs discovery at CERN? There's no way anything like this would be kept quiet due to social media and anonymity nowadays.
I'm increasingly convinced that we've made contact and are just not being told.
Man, I don't know that I've ever seen a perspective like this of Mars, much less a whole video. This is super rad!

Some detail:

>In this remarkable movie, the Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) on Mars Express was used for the first time to image the limb of Mars during most of a complete orbit, showing in good detail the atmosphere seen ‘on edge’ at the apparent border between the planet’s surface and space.

>The movie was stitched together from a series of 403 still images acquired by the camera during 13:45–19:09 GMT on 29 April 2016, during orbit 15624.

>The spacecraft was commanded to turn as it orbited Mars, which kept the camera pointing at the brightest point on the horizon as Mars Express passed over the southern hemisphere.

Shout out to: Alejandro Cardesin at the Mars Express Science Operations Centre, ESAC, Spain, and Simon Wood, Spacecraft Operations Engineer at ESOC, Germany.

Edit: The whole video is just the same length as the GIF.
Ok, look for the spacecraft.. Look for the spacecraft, still don't see it.. Oh we are zooming in, .. Was that it was that the spacecraft?... oh... we are the spacecraft...

Right.. 
I always get thrown off wth distances in space. Every time. This had me thinking "it's gonna crash it's gonna crash it's gonna crash!" When in reality it was probably a few hundred miles above the surface at its closest point.
you can really make out how thin Mars' atmosphere is in this video
Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit... Phew.


OK wow, OP. You got to warn people, fam. That scared the shit out of me and I could not look away. 
In the middle of the screen on the right something that looks like water spots appears on the lens at the closer point of the orbit- What's that about?
Orbiting is like falling but always missing ... I don't remeber where I got that quote from.
It is amazing to realize the demonstration of Kepler's law here : the closer we get the fastest. Pretty cool!
Ohhhh that was so much cooler than I thought it'd be!!! I was expecting a little probe looking thing to zoom past but the WE zoomed passed instead hah!!!!

I thought that tiny white dot was the spacecraft, realized it was just dust on my screen. 

I keenly look for tiny dots in such gifs.
I was thinking for a moment "where's the spacecraft. " then I realized, the video IS from the spacecraft. 
From the video it looks like there's a huge risk of getting aerobraking. Does anyone know if it did? That would cost a lot of delta-v!
[Literally all I could think of while watching this was Doom 3](https://gifsound.com/?gif=https://giant.gfycat.com/LankyFluidIberianemeraldlizard.gif&v=ewcibnrkIUE)
If you look closely to they upper left you can see what makes it fake.
If we took this footage in a time machine and showed the comic book reading radio listening kids of the 1950's this I think the mind blowing would be so severe that they would have to live the rest of their lives in those giant iron lung machines.
They call orbiting "falling toward the ground and missing". This really helps visualize that idea!
"Oh hey Mars! Just gonna get a closer look at ya here so I can study your atmosph-shit shit shit shit too close, sorry!"
I turned my head to watch this upside down. Because that's the perspective I'm used to enjoying from movies/games. :P
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon - but only because it's so cool I didn't want it to stop.
It's weird how my brain knows it's real but can't stop seeing a computer generated image.  Like I have to keep reminding myself it's real over and over.  
If you squint your eyes and use some imagination, it looks like we're looking through a straw at somebody's skin who has acne. 

Fuck, I'm high 
Thought this was r/science for a second. So dissapointed. I thought we'd discovered an alien spacecraft orbiting mars.
I took me an embarrassing amount of time to figure out where the spacecraft was...
Amazing how the camera got almost blind by the sun light when passing by the pole.
Someone please confirm or deny my assumption.  

>The ISS is maintained in a nearly circular orbit with a minimum mean altitude of 330 km (205 mi) and a maximum of 410 km (255 mi)

So what I'm getting from this is that this spacecraft is in a highly elliptical orbit with the purpose of sling shotting itself to travel elsewhere.  

The ISS has a much more circular orbit to maintain speed it's orbit.  
Judging by the ESA in the side this is probably from the orbiter that sent the probe to the planet that crashed in the summer. Left a crater!

That's what your $3,400,000,000,000 in annual tribute to the Right Stuff looks like in the rear-view mirror, lol. Aaaaand, it's gone!
The fact that the visible Universe has a radius that is larger in light-years than the Universe is old, plus the fact that the Universe is in thermodynamic equilibrium on the largest scales, gives impetus to the concept of cosmic inflation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)

This problem is referred to as the Horizon Problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem

Long story short, if you looked a distance equal to the age of the Universe, you'd see a part of the Universe that's younger than that, because as far as we can tell, the Universe expanded more rapidly than the speed of light.
Theoretically you would be looking into the past, close to 13.8 billion years ago. But actually it's not possible to look that far back, since space and time did not exist before the Big Bang. 

Looking into dark regions of space, the Hubble Telescope has captured images of galaxies believed to be "only" 500 million years old, corresponding to the youngest galaxies in the Universe.  

[Hubble Deep Field (Wikipedia)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/HDF_extracts_showing_many_galaxies.jpg) 


NOT the edge of the universe.  It's expanding outwards in all directions at once, so it's more than 15 billion years across.  Simply put, the universe isn't old enough for some light to have traveled to Earth yet.
You would see more of the same...  a flat universe not much different from what you're seeing now. 
That is what is being done now with Hubble and other large telescopes. They are looking optically into the past, about 13.4 billion Earth-reference years, and those early dim galaxies are about 13.4 billion light-years in distance.  It is a straight-line approximation and using light in its particle form, photons.  There are other satellite observatories like WAP that are measuring the EM waves of our present and that provides the distance to the CMB in our present, about 46 billion light-years distance.  
  
This is a simplified schematic of the 2D universe, each flat plane a time slice. At the top is our present, looking at the distant galaxies towards the singularity. If the singularity is at t=0 and z=0, then we are z=+13.8 billion light-years in distance at t=+13.8 billion Earth-reference years.  
  
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Universe_expansion.png  
  
NASA has a similar schematic but it is constructed from empirical data and instead of an inverted pyramid, the structure of space-time is depicted more like a fluted cone comprised of the space-time grid, with 2D time slices.  
  
http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/060915/060915_CMB_Timeline75.jpg
  
While we live in the universe, we can't fully visualize it since it is at least an 11-dimensional manifold and probably needs a 16-dimensional manifold with relativistic effects to fully describe. We can visualize 2D time slices of our present, essentially a capture in time. The CMB is coming in from all directions. This ends up being a 3D sphere. The physical universe of stars, galaxies, dust and gas of the present is contained within that sphere.  
  
https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/splitearth.png
I would assume you'd see past the edge of the universe. If that is possible. Say the universe is X years old, then the radius would have to be less than Xlight years from the centre since the matter can't travel the speed of light. So,if from earth, you looked towards the closest edge then you would see past the edge of all matter.... I think.

Scientists of Reddit, is this correct?
If I'm reading the question correctly, then as soon as you look up into the sky you're already looking that distance.  Unfortunately light hasn't traveled far enough/has attenuated enough that you can't see anything
Shouldn't that be "*Hypothesis* Challenging Einstein's View on the Speed of Light Could Soon Be Tested"? It gets to be a Theory if it survives the test, and many more, and re-tests of the original tests by other labs, and then peer reviewed, right?
I received my BSEE in the 90's.  We were taught that the speed of light was only constant to a relativity, like a frame.  It is true and constant just like gravity is a constant.  

It was never portrayed to be similar to a geometric constant like pi.  It was only ever a relative constant like gravity.  

I guess the guardian isn't a real scientific source, so it would be easy to get wrong?  Or was I taught based on different concepts?
It is a widely known, irrefutable fact that the speed of light is 37 miles per hour. I measured it last Thursday and the guy holding the flashlight can confirm. Science.
Particles moving at infinite speed - yeah, sure. How does one slow down from infinity? 
Find an open source project on github and get involved. Focus on projects that are active (been around for more than 6 months and has multiple people committing to the repo)

If you can't find one that interests you, start your own and welcome anyone wanting to contribute. 
Learn about real time systems.  There's going to be hundreds of you graduating with web experience.  Be the guy that gets a career, not a job.  Learn how to write and document what you do.  Learn about development processes like Agile and why they're important.  Act as if your hobby work is your life's mission and document it.  Study up on information assurance (cybesecurity) so you're at least conversant in the topic.

Also, from what I've heard about SpaceX, learn to live without sleep. Just kidding.
All I've learned is to fast forward through the acting parts. I was so looking forward to this but it's so bad. Meanwhile at the same time SCI is running their Mars special that's also an hour long and all science.
This show has been very frustrating.  Every problem they face is the result of a deliberate choice to do things the hard way.  I won't reveal plot points, but for those who have been watching the show, consider how things would have been different had they been following the *Mars Direct* mission plan instead.

One thing I can mention without revealing plot points is that in the show, this mission is a privately funded commercial endeavour.  The investors are terrified and demand a working colony on the very first landing or the project is cancelled.  This is crazy, and illustrates perfectly what Neil DeGrasse Tyson has been saying about private enterprise in space.  Only after the government has carried out the initial exploration will private investors be comfortable to operate on Mars.

The show seems to depict a program of Mars exploration as led by Elon Musk and SpaceX, from the hardware down to Elon's in-show francophone counterpart.  Faithful and devoted fans of Mr. Musk should take notice of how this show reveals the significant flaws in this plan and the enormous problems SpaceX will face in leading the effort to put humans on Mars if they try do it on their own with ITS in its current form.
Get the Google Sky Map app for your smart phone.  Run app...point at sky.  
http://www.sky-map.org might help you out. I just searched "Orion's Belt" and there are a few stars to the left as well as a nebula. The "sparkling" of the object is due to atmospheric disturbances and varying densities that the light is passing through. Probably just particular conditions there that made it stand out more. 
Sounds like Sirius. [Take a look at this sky chart](http://www.heavens-above.com/skychart2.aspx?lat=46.0122&lng=14.6338&loc=Unspecified&alt=512&tz=CET). It's set for somewhere in Slovenia, you'll need to specify the time of your observation. Is it Sirius?

I usually find any time someone asks about a surprisingly bright, multicolored, twinkling star near Orion's belt, it's Sirius. Sirius is very bright; because of that, and with a turbulent atmosphere, it can appear to twinkle quite a lot and in multiple colors.
Awesome technology. Crappy headline.

This story isn't about an imminent impact (as the clickbait headline insinuates), but our new ability to detect asteroids a week before a flyby. That's the real news-worthy stuff there!
[It spots similar objects frequently](https://twitter.com/minorplanetctr)

2016 WQ8 looks much more interesting than the one they reported there. Announced yesterday, it has a diameter of 22-68 meters - potentially large enough to wipe out a city. It will pass Earth at 5 lunar distances on December 8th.

Things get interesting if the LD estimate is consistent with zero and the diameter estimate is potentially larger than 10 meters.
Its 150 light years away. We need faster than light speed space travel if we want to explore these places.
The article states:

> An international team of astronomers using Hubble have been able to study stellar evolution in real time. Over a period of 30 years dramatic increases in the temperature of the star SAO 244567 have been observed. Now the star is cooling again, having been reborn into an earlier phase of stellar evolution. This makes it the first reborn star to have been observed during both the heating and cooling stages of rebirth.
There's the [Alcubierre Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive), but it's ***super*** theoretical.
>For example, we know that traditional "A" to "B" travel via fuels and rockets is not practical for significant distances.

False. We have put spacecraft (namely, Pioneer 10, 11, Voyager 1, 2, and New Horizons) on slow interstellar trajectories using relatively small chemical boosters and gravity assists. For faster trajectories, all we need is double down. Advanced ion thrusters are a workable alternative for small probes, while bigger craft may need antimatter, nuclear salts or just a few thousand nukes - all of which still qualify as "fuels and rockets".

>So today, are there any alternatives that have started to gain traction, i.e. bending space/time/wormholes or something similar to Star Trek's "warp-drive"?

None. The fact that NASA's Alcubierre drive team at EagleWorks has been trying to gain publicity by claiming that EmDrive warps space inside it raises a lot of red flags. And the EmDrive itself already has more red flags than a Communist rally.

Explanation: Where do stars form? Many times, stars form in energetic regions where gas and dark dust are pushed around in chaotic mayhem. Pictured, bright massive stars near the center of W5, the Soul Nebula, are exploding and emitting ionizing light and energetic winds. The outward-moving light and gas push away and evaporate much surrounding gas and dust, but leave pillars of gas behind dense protective knots. Inside these knots, though, stars also form. The featured image highlights the inner sanctum of W5, an arena spanning about 1,000 light years that is rich in star forming pillars. The Soul Nebula, also cataloged as IC 1848, lies about 6,500 light years away toward the constellation of the Queen of Aethopia (Cassiopeia). Likely, in few hundred million years, only a cluster of the resulting stars will remain. Then, these stars will drift apart.
Interesting how you can make out the difference between Spain and Portugal.

Looks like Portugal use different colour lights, more orange/yellow. Also the dark parts of Spain seem darker than in Portugal.
I never thought of Portugal as densely populated.

After seeing this picture, I read a bit up on Portugal. 115/km^2 that's dense!
If you click the photo (on mobile at least) stars pop up everywhere. Also, the best part of the photo is the atmosphere. Looks weird and awesome. 
I'm spanish and that's very sad. All that light should be point DOWN to the floor, not lighting up the sky. That way we could see the milky way and stars from a lot more places, slightly on cities too even with the pollution.

PS: I know that you could still see the light from space if all the lights pointed down to the floor, but not like this. All those lights are pointing up.
this is awesome! some might think this isn't glamorous but this is the nitty gritty that a space-faring civilization (like i dream we will be) would depend on. I imagine it's similar to how we depend on garbage companies, the roads that the trucks drive on, etc. you just gotta have free and clear orbits before you think about regular travel to moon bases and mars colonies
There seems to be more and more evidence that simulated gravity will be imperative for longer-term space flight. Rotating ships don't seem like that difficult to design and implement. 
If this turns out to be the true cause of VIIP, it could be good news for Mars explorers. I expect it is very probable that the confusion of the cerebrospinal fluid system would be greatly reduced if not completely eliminated by the pressure changes generated by 0.38g. 
This is incredibly cool, beautiful and quite humbling.

What's the perspective? Are we looking at a portion of the galaxy from a great distance? Is this the view from Earth? I'd love to understand what we're seeing a bit better.
Do you plan on releasing the source code ? I would love to play with this stuff !

Great work, by the way !
Very interesting and mesmerizing. Thanks for doing that. How fast would you have to be moving to circumnavigate these in real life? Would that be moving many times the speed of light? 
Would it be possible to show the different red or blue shifted stars? 
Thats great and all but 1 billion stars is less than 1% of the milky way really shows how massive our galaxy is, Even crazier to think there are trillions of galaxies
Nice!  Been meaning to try something like this myself but I don't know anything about graphics programming :(    
While I don't doubt you plotted them all according to the dataset, I reckon I could get close enough with a randomizer and a basic "thicker in the middle" distribution patter and nobody would know the difference.
> In fact, diamond is the hardest substance known to man, there is literally nothing we could use that could offer more protection.

Yeah, but no. Diamonds are hard but brittle. They will not scratch but they can crack or shatter easily. 

According to /u/p1mrx in [this comment at /r/energy](https://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/5f8ltu/diamondage_of_power_generation_as_nuclear/daih2ol/), the power output could be around 1mW/g (1 milliwatt per gram), which is too low for any common-day (at least for the general public) usage here on earth, but good enough for space probes I reckon.
>A team of physicists and chemists from the University of Bristol have grown a man-made diamond that, when placed in a radioactive field, is able to generate a small electrical current. The development could solve some of the problems of nuclear waste, ***clean electricity generation*** and battery life.

I think their definition of "clean" is different to mine. I definitely wouldn't want this in my new S7 phone.
I think this can be used in guns. I saw laser guns powered by nuclear batteries in fallout 4.
Diamond batteries sounds expensive. Would there be any alternative materials to hold the radioactivity? Maybe a 95% shielding seal would suffice, and be much cheaper. 

Another thought, once the power/$ is high enough I'm sure oil lobbyists would shut it down.  
I believe it's because "A" is the designation of the Primary star in a system, always. The first planet would be a "b", a companion star would be "B", etc. 
The only designation of "a" should be the star itself.
>It was only five years ago when the Space Coast region was buckled under the loss of almost 9,000 high-wage jobs with the retirement of the Space Shuttle Program

You’re kidding. It feels like a fucking eternity… Finally some light at the end of this tunnel, though.

If I know anything about Redditors, it's that they looooove Huffington Post articles.
So, you are saying that since people in the future are going to forget the stories we've been telling each other for the last several thousand years, we should come up with constellations based on the stories that they'll be telling in the future?
There are nearly 10,000 stars visible to the unaided eye on a clear, moonless night under ideal conditions with good vision.  There are only about 3000 known exoplanets, and many (most?) of those orbit stars that aren't even visible to the unaided eye.
As long as the optic nerve isn't damaged, I would take the tradeoff.  Being far sighted as a result of being in spaaaace?

I'm okay with this.

But this is assuming that's all that happens.  Truth is there's also DNA damage, bone density loss, muscle density loss... 

Still... okay with it.  SPAAAAACE!
There is no such thing as negative pressure. Absolute pressure ASL is about 14.7 psi. It cannot equal or drop below zero, no matter how hard you suck.
Pressure is caused by fluids/gasses exerting force on a container. When a container is at 'equal' pressure, the contents of the container exert force on the insides of the container equal to the force exerted by the surrounding environment on the container. You can create a negative pressure on Earth by removing gasses from a sealed container - in this case, the force exerted by air molecules in the atmosphere is higher than the force exerted by anything left inside the container. At sea level, air exerts 14.7 pounds of force per square inch of surface area, so the maximum "negative" pressure you can ever achive is -14.7 PSI.

Space is pretty empty. There isn't much there to exert any sort of force on a container, so you can not have negative pressure of any significance.
a "vaccum cleaner" would only work inside a spacecraft, as you say - it causes air to flow from high (well, atmospheric-ish...) pressure in a room/cabin toward the low pressure area inside the nozzle, picking up and dragging along dust etc on the way

without a medium (atmosphere/air) there's no way for the dust to get dragged along with it into the cleaner...

IE There's no way to make a pressure difference in a vacuum, and without a "difference" there's no way for things to flow from high to low)

maybe a "net casting" idea or an unfurled sail-type thing would work to collect "space dust" ?

AFAIK, missions that talk about "vacuuming a sample off an asteroid" and such are planning to bring their own atmosphere in the form of a little nitrogen gas blower. So shoot that at the surface and it will blow dust into/onto a collector. No real sucking, though.
Vacuum is, simply, relative lack of any air (gas) molecules. At "standard temperature and pressure" (STP), a mole of a gas occupies about 22 cubic feet. That's about 6 times 10^27 molecules.  The pressure is the effect of those fast moving molecules bouncing against the walls of the container. (They are also bumping into each other but we don't measure that directly.)

So a vacuum is a reduction in the number of molecules, which reduces the number of collisions with the wall, and thus the pressure measured. (Temperature is also intimately related but I'm ignoring that for now.)

When nearly all the molecules have been removed we have a "high vacuum". As the vacuum gets higher, the chance of molecules bumping into each other before they bump into the wall goes down. This means each molecule may travel farther between collisions - the "mean free path" gets longer.

At extremely high vacuums there may be a countable number of molecules flying around - thousands per cubic foot. The mean free path may approach the size of the container. Achieving this level of vacuum is extremely difficult on Earth.

But that is still nowhere near the vacuum of outer space, which can range from dozens of molecules per cubic foot down to one or two per cubic meter. Nobody I know of has achieved those levels.

The best way to "suck up" dust is likely to be electrostatic attraction. This has been proposed for such things as mining moon dust. It can also be used for processing such as chromatography to separate different materials.
Thats tough for Russia, dropping down the ranks, but don't most of the US ULA launches use the Russian RD-180, in which case you could argue that Russia is still launching more vehicles into space than anyone else... I mean if you wanted to argue that is.

I also believe that the Chinese "Long March" is based on the Rd-120, I know its just arguing semantics, but it is interesting that although the Russian economy is so bad and Russia bashing is all the rage, that their old rocker engines are still viable.
Not correct, Russia fell behind the USA between 1958-1966 and again between 1996-2003. This is the first time that Russia has fallen behind China. The headline is somewhat disengenuous.
that seemingly simple image is based on more math than I will ever do in my lifetime.
Image sourced from here: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/science/cassini-saturn-rings.html
How do they change their inclination so much? That takes a lot of dV
Does anyone know how these sort of maneuvers are planned? Multiple gravity assists over the span of several years. Is it optimized by computer simulation or more of a manual process?
I worked on the Cassini mission when I was a student at U of Arizona. It makes me sad its going to crash into Saturn. I wish they will let it just be.
All this needs is the mass effect critical failure music that happens when you die 
This looks like the trajectories I will travel between stores to get my Christmas shopping done.

I hope you like it
thanks to kerbal space program, i completely understand the physics behind this orbital pattern 
And will this ever happen in our lifetime or is that one of those in 2 million years things?
I noticed that there are 3 particular points (2 only with blues and 1 with blue and yellow) where a good majority of the orbits keep intersecting. Is there something significant with these positions?
I'd really like to see an animated version, the order of each orbit drawn on.
the current NAIF  spice orbital data for Cassini  is public information 

ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/pds/data/co-s_j_e_v-spice-6-v1.0/cosp_1000/data/


i can make it spin both ways with my mind which way is it actual spinning? 
my physics teacher is actually one of the people who worked on the Cassini mission
I hope there's a tardigrade still on Cassini that survives and colonizes the planet
What will happen to satellite after it enters the atmosphere of Saturn? Assuming it will be crushed, what if there was a ridiculously strong satellite that can go through Saturn, will it ever hit a surface? 
This image would be easy to turn into a 3D animated cross eye view.  I'll see what I can do on this crappy ol computer

So this was to get the right trajectory to land or velocity...am I correct?  I know I heard sometime but I can't remember the reasoning behind it 
I'm not sure to understand what it is ( I'm not English so I'm not 100% sure about the meaning of the sentence )

Is it the orbit it will make around Saturn before killing itself in the atmosphere ?
Why are they plunging it into Saturn and (I'm assuming) destroying it? Wouldn't it be more useful to land it onto Titan or something?
The amount of math calculated to make this simple gif is mind boggling 
And the saturnians are now drawing the same graph, which accelerates their  evacuation plan to Mars. 

The race is on!
Science is flipping awesome and, by extension, scientists are flipping awesome. We need to give them more of our attention and our respect.  
Can anyone provide a link to an image just like this except it's an image of our solar system and the planets orbital path? I've always been curious about how our solar moves but I've never been able to find an image or video showing exactly how our solar system works. 
Will we get any close ups/possible upper atmosphere shots of Saturn? Or will Cassini be crushed by the pressure and gravity before we have a chance?

Would it be possible to slingshot it out of the Saturn system all together?
How many actual maneuvers costing how much dv are needed? Or is this all a giant sequence of gravity assists without any course corrections that are already preplanned before the mission started?
OK. Assuming that this visualisation is the result of a simulation, and therefore a complex iterative process with a margin of error at every step, does anyone know what the margin for error is at the end of the path?

Can we predict which side of the planet it will land on? or what street? ;)
Just wondering, but why so many 'weird' orbits and why no slowing down, to then plunge down?
How are they going to adjust the orbit so constantly? Gravity assists or active burns?
This doesn't look like it'll take that long. Maybe 50 orbits or so. How many years is that?
For anyone else wondering where Saturn's rings are, you can see them best when the tan oval is pointing to the right. I couldn't see them at first.
This doesn't seem like that many more orbits. Is this a simplified version? If not, how long does one orbit usually take?

So how much better will the images it takes of the rings and atmosphere be on these final close approaches compared to what we've seen in the past?
I would love to see one of these deep space probes jettison a tiny clock or gyroscope or something and retrieve it *n* loops later on a fly-by as part of a relativity experiment. I know the object would have to be decelerated to basically stationary, and I know those overlapping nodes aren't single points but are pretty vast regions of space. Still, we really are just *this* close to pulling off this sort of cosmic game of duck-duck-goose, and that is truly remarkable.
Wait a minute !!! This is the actual curve of Cassini ???? 

3x + 3 x 2 + 4213 cos 323 sin 432 + 2 - x * z - x = e-a+r*t/h. 

The trajectory is wrong !!! Its going to ... DESTROY th earth !
How do they change from an equatorial orbit to a polar orbit without using a shit-ton of fuel?
Why is the mission being terminated?

Did it run out of something critical, like propellant?
Ridiculously cool graphic. I don't even care which orbits they are.....and I visit the NASA website almost everyday
After seeing this, I feel like we're (Earth) *definitely* going to crash into something
I'm curious if the impact such am event would have in the solar system? If any?
Why are there so many changes to the orbit? I know I don't have the right language but it looks like there cassini spend time in 4 major planes.  
I think 1 is from arrival.  then 2 different ones for instrumentation?  But then why do 2 of the major orbits exist entirely on the different sides of the axis?   
Wasn't there a huge fuel requirement for all these adjustments?
So... why are plunging this thing into Saturn, again? We can't make it take a few pictures then explore another thing?

EDIT: guys, I get it. I dumbed out there. I understand my mistake now. Is it really necessary to continue downvoting me?

I don't think this is simulating a gravity like force. The particles don't end up following elliptical orbits like they would under a gravity field. 
Could someone explain why the patricles burst out whenever the gravity becomes too large, or if it's just like a sort of hard reset button that was implementet into the website?
I know it's a hopeless dream, but I'm really hoping that space exploration manages to make space tourism to Saturn a thing before I die. The size of those rings is unexpectedly staggering, I wish I could see them with my own eyes.

In a spacesuit!! Who poops in a spacesuit. Even if an astronaut is doing a 12-16hr spacewalk, don't think its a problem unless its an emergency diarrhea.
Maybe a filtration system that turns human waste into water? It would be a similar process that citys use for sweage water to make it safe for human consumption. Just on a much smaller scale.
I'm thinking they could put some kind of airlock-like flushing system, not practical for your everyday spacewalk but likely necessary in the event of a emergency or extremely long missions.
NASA, I've got the solution.. send up toilet trained astronauts if that's such a pressing issue xD
Why though? These images are all public domain. I could probably get them printed cheaper at a generic printshop (which would have the advantage of its overhead costs being spread over a larger customer base, and no shipping costs), or use my own printer (ink and paper for a pro-level printer are still just a couple dollars per print)
Goodluck! I know how hard it is to start a business. It isnt easy haha.

Does anybody know the length of time this gif covers? (20 minutes, 45, etc?)
Wow, this is great. It looks just like in Kerbal Space Program when I try to dock to my station... minus the explosions.
These guys dock multi-million dollar spacecrafts traveling at thousands of miles an hour hundreds of miles above the Earth... and some days I struggle to tie my shoes.
Am I getting this right : the Soyuz aimed for a higher orbit than the ISS before this rendez-vous manoeuver. Since its at greater altitude, it's orbital velocity is smaller than that of the ISS which is intended to sync the Soyuz while putting it almost above the ISS. At the moment this video is shot, it's using thrust with a little orbital decay to dock correctly ?
It is relatively simple to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, it just takes energy.
I'm no scientist, but lack of an atmosphere might be a problem here
TL;DR for everyone talking about launching shit to mars:

The issue here is that while *wearing a spacesuit* astronauts are literally wearing diapers.

If anything were to happen, trapping an astronaut in his suit for more than the normal several hours..... Its no long term solution 
They should just use it to construct a giant shit-ball satellite in orbit. It may be useful at some point in the future, and if not, they can always rain a giant shit-ball down on any country as a symbolic gesture.
For anyone who didn't read the article, the problem isn't what to do with it onboard a spacecraft or station. It's what to do with it if there is an emergency and they need to email in their suits for an extended period of time, a minimum of 6 days.
They could use it as fuel? I don't know how much energy could be used from poop but they could make a robot powered by the poop. It could do small tasks like cleaning or something (or be a useful robot depending on how much energy can be used). The C.R.A.P- Cleaning Robot Apparatus Pod

How about during the emergency situation not eating solid food and using a sort of nutritious liquid IV instead?

I recall one of my friends had an intestinal operation and he told me he didn't used the toilet for many days while he was fed by IV liquids.
Should collect loads of it and shoot it off to mars to fertilise the ground...
Jettison it towards earth to help keep iss in space. Or expose to space, then bring it back in for fertilizer, although I don't think iss is doing anything big with growing their own crops.
The fastest would be through an incinerator, right? Though I'm sure astronauts won't like wearing mini-furnaces in their hindquarters.

Maybe dehydrate the stuff, and gradually release the residue through pores in the suit?
Extract water from it and filter the water, then use the dry solid as fertilizer for plants being cultivated in space

Peer review is a sanity check.  A bunch of peers of the publishers review the methodology and experimental procedure and say "There are no obvious schoolboy errors here, your layout and mathematical analyses and the results you have measured seem to agree with what you are claiming you are testing.  In addition, we concur that your list of potential error sources is correct and concur that they require further testing"

Peer review doesn't mean something works.  Peer review means that an independent group of people  from the publishing researchers have viewed the data and paper and have not spotted any massive red flags which should prevent publishing.

EMDrive as a device is still up in the air; this paper just means that if it doesn't work, the reason it doesn't work is as yet undetermined.

Disclaimer:  I'm a software dev who did undergrad physics.  I'm also a huge space / sci-fi nut.  I would love EMDrive to work.  The realist in me, however, has to accept that the most likely explanation is unaccounted for magnetic or thermal effects.  


I have degrees in physics and aero/astro. I've also worked on several interplanetary space missions. The explanation for the reaction of /r/physics and the physics community at large (or the small segment that even has cared to follow the EM drive) is the following:

1. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. A reactionless drive would likely imply new physics (even if the explanation is the quantum vacuum conjecture in the paper). The bar is very high, and extreme skepticism is the correct Bayesian prior.

2. The team that did this research at Eagleworks has up to the publication of this paper been secretive and elusive. Given the extraordinary nature of the claims, this has further helped to paint the picture that his work doesn't pass the smell test.

3. Experimental error is extremely likely when you're dealing with forces this small. Occam's razor is that this is an experimental error. The proper way to present work like this is with a great deal of humility and self-skepticism. See the wonderful way the OPERA team handled the publication of the [faster than light neutrino anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly). By contrast, the team here has nowhere near approached that level of humility.

4. Given the simplicity of the experimental setup and the relative lack of published history of the [people behind the EM drive](http://emdrive.com/background.html), there isn't much of a foundation of credibility. If such a simple setup truly showed new physics, it's very unlikely it wouldn't have been seen in a similar setup previously. Obviously, you cannot discount that these guys are brilliant mavericks, but, again, the alternative is more likely.

None of this means that any idea should be downright rejected, however this my impression of the general hostility met by the scientific community. As someone who's done both physics research and worked on large space missions, I personally consider the EM drive to be almost certain to be experimental error. However, trust me, I'd be nothing but delighted if I was wrong.
My thoughts are merely to remind people that "hell bent on proving the study is inconclusive and shows no clear evidence" is a pretty good working definition of 'science'.
There is no real argument against the point raised by the folks at Weekly Space Hangout  https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/5f020n/nasa_emdrive_paper_should_not_have_been_allowed/  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf4cueArgJU&feature=youtu.be&t=2482  

The margin of error of the individual measurements for each power setting is much smaller than the spread between those individual measurements. So the actual margin of error is much larger than presented with the individual measurements - they are essentially measuring noise.  

Just because it passed peer-review does not mean that t works. It means that there are no glaring problems with the experiments.

I'm not buying the EM drive. The "thrust" is so small and so far within the margin of error, it just seems ridiculous to attribute it to the engine. 
I'm not an expert but I hope the EM drive works. Not only would it be an interesting new propulsion system but it would also prove wrong a lot of things we thought we knew.
My initial thoughts were that the physics community obviously has a bone to pick with the EM Drive (for obvious reasons). However, the top comment raises several good points, and had me halfway convinced that the results could me anomalous... except for the fact that this **IS** in the peer-reviewed AIAA Journal of Propulsion, and NASA / the AIAA have been avoiding the EM Drive like the plague (nobody wants a repeat of cold fusion).

However, as I kept reading, I would see comments such as, "it's just a low-impact, irrelevant journal looking to get some quick attention." This is obviously false -- while I'm sure the AIAA journal doesn't hold much water in the physics community, it is very well respected in the aerospace engineering field.

Needless to say, I'm not completely convinced that a few Redditors could single-handedly disprove what a NASA / AIAA peer-review could not. I have never taken Quantum Field Theory, so I cannot comment on EagleWork's hypothesis, but I would really like to hear some actual engineers give some input as to their thoughts on the publication. It got a bit tiring discussing the issue with only physicists -- they seem to have an inherent negative bias toward the EM Drive, simply because it doesn't make any sense given the laws of classical physics (implying that it is a phenomenon related to quantum mechanics, if the EM Drive is indeed producing thrust). Since EagleWorks hypothesis about the "quantum vacuum" is apparently shady at best (according to all the armchair Redditor physicists), they *really* don't like this publication.

Please -- let me know what y'all think of this!
I was disappointed that the paper did not discuss plans for (hopefully independent) follow-on validation testing.   NASA Glenn Research Center has an outstanding [electric propulsion facility](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/ep/). So does the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory(JPL)](http://dst.jpl.nasa.gov/thrusters/testbeds.htm).  Both these facilities are obvious and logical sites for validation testing.  The test results did not convince me that there was a net positive thrust indicating "reactionless" propulsion, but more compelling is that the experts (e.g., NASA GRC & JPL) in low thrust electric propulsion development and testing don't seem to be demanding the chance to test the device.  Since actual success would bring Nobel prize level recognition, that seems pretty damning to me.

The Cold Fusion of the 21st century. And that's all that's really needed.
Here is a good video on the EM drive study.

https://youtu.be/jCAqDA8IfR4

One of the main points in it is even if you assume the study results are true, an EM drive powered by 80W could lift a water droplet.

A prediction of what is actually happening is at the end of the video. It has to do with heating up one side of the cone causing a different reaction to the atmosphere at that side, creating the "thrust".
Thank god we have redditors to poke holes in the scientific experiments published in peer reviewed journals by actual scientists...
My take on it is simple:

1) Build it.

2) Launch it.

3) Switch the damned thing on.

[If it actually moves what it's attached to, *then* it's time to start arguing over why it's impossible and shouldn't work!]

4) Hilarity ensues.
Just send up a handful of grass seed and within a week the entire moon will be covered in dandelions.
Is it or is not illegal to grow marijuana on the moon? You could be rich. 
So where does your plant get the water and oxygen from and how do you want to protect it from extreme temperatures and things like solar Winds?   
A little too ambitious I think. SWaP constraints seem way too small for a pressure vessel, gas storage, air lock, and other mechanisms. 

Also, your project requires you to be very near the surface, can the lander accommodate this? And where will you get light for the seeds? 
This is awesome! If you win and succeed, is there a future plan to send plants somewhere else i.e. Mars?
Saw many videos in youtube related to different teams with the same aim . But who approves any country to plant something ( success or failure)on the moon . Is there a law
I'll answer all of your questions:
First of all, we are using micro electric valves to pump in aqueous solutions of fertilizer as well as air (to re-pressurize the vessel). The lunar rover will put our device right on top of the lunar surface. We will excavate the soil by using an Archimedean screw system. The seeds we are using are extremely small arabidopsis seeds that need only one gram of soil to thrive. Hope that clarifies some things. I'm happy to answer more questions.

"*Bob Walker, A Trump campaign adviser, however, claimed that doubt over the role of human activity in climate change 'is a view shared by half the climatologists in the world.*'"

That is patently false. A 2013 paper in Environmental Research Letters reviewed 11,944 abstracts of scientific papers matching "global warming" or "global climate change". They found 4,014 which discussed the cause of recent global warming, and of these "**97.1%** endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming".

This is just one more example of how Donald Trump and his minions perpetuate the "Big Lie" theory of Joseph Goebbels (“If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.")
We talk any checks any balances but there's nothing balanced about allowing politicians to control the one aspect of society that can expose lies and resulting disasters...it's happening in climate science, but where else? Energy? Economics? Human rights? 

If they control the collection and flow of knowledge, how do you expect any fundamental change from this embarrassing state of affairs? Does it occur to you what we might achieve if we organized to support the freedom of knowledge - if only to gauge the potential of our innovation? 

This is scary as hell, and Evesham scarier is the complacency. So I'll plug the [Adorners subreddit ](www.reddit.com/r/adorners ) in fanciful hope that we'll begin to have some coherent reaction to this major, universal problem. 
The deplorables are in full swing on this thread, it's amazing how easily they get triggered.
The glory days of the Dark Ages are back. What a great time to be alive!
I don't see this happening. There are too many opportunities to make money surround climate change
No it won't and nasa won't let it go down without a fight.  Evidence doesn't just die.  It'll take considerable effort to eliminate/minimize the research.  Trump's administration will have significantly larger issues to address.

Besides, this is reminiscent of more fake news.
thank god! put more money in actually building new space ships to move people. the only way to save the planet is to leave it. climate change solved.
Trumpkins are too busy sucking on daddy satan's cock to care.

"Bow down before the one you serve, you're going to get what you deserve..." -- Nine Inch Nails
Fucking good. There are countless private organizations and government agencies in every developed nation on Earth studying climate change. Nasa sent men to the moon once. They have better things to do than to waste money doing something everyone else is already doing. 
Politics and science should never mix.  We don't need to keep spending billions of tax dollars "researching" things we already know about and are powerless to reverse.  


Mother nature isn't going to change her ways no matter how green and clean we make the Earth. Or how many trillions we spend reeducating the people.   
This is really nice. Thanks for sharing it OP. 

Does someone know from how far away that SpaceX ITS could be heard?

Would that be a **massive** distance or just like 200km? I know 200km is also far but, in my small country we heard an F16 sonic boom in 2 provinces from our jets when jets from a 'certain' country entered our airspace, again.

No one really has heard something that loud before so we were all thinking that it was the huge earthquake or something (because of gas extraction), but like I said it were just two F16's...

We also heard the new F35's flying over... that was also pretty loud for just 2 beautiful engineered jets just cruising!

Sorry for my English, it is not my native language.
Note that energia was without buran, with buran it was around 23t iirc.
The Falcon 9 needs a bit of an update on there. v1.1 was indeed rated for about 13000kg but the new FT version is good for nearly 23000kg.

The Energia, that beautiful little bastard, matching the Block 1B at half the size.

Say what you want about the Russians, they knew how to build rockets.
Good god the ITS really is in a class of its own. But its exciting to see the general trend of launch vehicle performance. Though I wish there were more Chinese rockets in there for comparison sake, the Long March 5 has some impressive stats, and the Long March 9, once it flies, will be able to compete with SLS head on
Nice image comparison, except for the ITS bar taking up half the horizontal space of the entire image.
Updated version[](http://imgur.com/a/VS7i4)
550000kg.

550 tons.

FIVE. HUNDRED. AND. FIFTY. TONS. TO LOW EARTH ORBIT.

I am in awe. That's goddamn incredible. Can't wait to see what this means for the space industry.
There are many many things wrong with that graphic. If you don't know enough about rockets, please don't do infographics because people will end up sharing and learning wrong figures.

All these naysayers today! They remind me of my grandmother who disses everything. I always imagine a scenario in ancient times when the tribal peoples were out picking berries and one of them decided instead to work on a "box and wheel" device. All the others would be like my grandmother and scoff about wasting time not actually picking berries. If they had their way the wheelbarrow would never have been invented. Actually that's probably why it took so damn long to invent the wheelbarrow.


I like this article because it mentions the involved scientists, where they are, what they are doing and links relevant papers/articles/journals.
Really interesting. The first thing I thought of was "the fast and the slow" from A Fire Upon the Deep. 

For people who haven't read the book, they get around warp drives and speed of light by saying there is a section of the galaxy where the speed of light is just different. We live in "the slow", where if you cross the boundary you can become trapped. 
It could also be...that the expansion of the Universe has a hand in the fluctuations in light speed.
We'll all still call it Alpha Centauri. We already know it by that name. Seems a bit ridiculous to rename it IMHO. 
Just to be clear, it isn't being **re**named.  Rigil Kentaurus has been one of the oldest, most common names associated with the star.  It probably *is* the best candidate for the star's "official" name.  It has just not been as popular as Alpha Centauri in "recent" years.  For sake of comparison, [the star's *name* is listed as Rigel Kentaurus on the star's SIMBAD page](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Alpha+Centauri) (SIMBAD being basically *the* go-to general-but-non-specific catalogue for astronomers), even though it labels it as "alf Cen" at the top of the page.  We're just talking about choosing between the various different common/historical identifiers (on the SIMBAD page alone the star has 36 unique names or catalogue numbers).

It looks like the IAU is just putting it's foot down about what "official" named-names it wants to keep in it's official database for future work.  I can see the utility, though it's not really any big deal at the end of the day.  Nobody is going to stop using the myriad of common alternate names - it doesn't even look like the IAU is arguing that they should.  The questionable part of this is why they're being strangely inconsistent with it:  Alpha Centauri is ignored, but Proxima Centauri isn't?  But, hey, that's the IAU for you. ;)

(A silly personal anecdote - we run outreach nights with school kids at the observatory where I work, and none of us can ever remember how to get our Meade telescope to auto-slew to Alpha Centauri (a nice double star for kids) because it's stored as "Rigil Kent" in the telescope's software, and none of us can ever remember it. :P  Luckily, it's super easy to manually slew to.)
So Alpha Centauri is now Rigil Kentaurus but Proxima Centauri is still the same?

Would have thought it made more sense to maintain a consistent triple star system name rather than to split it up.

I'm not sure where, but I gave seen the name Rigil Centaurus before.  Also the adjective alpha means that it's the brightest star in the constellation, which will remain true.
The math and technology that go into making this work blows my fucking mind.

Any idea what the spinning thing on the right is that stops spinning halfway through? 
Neat. Someone should add this soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3zvVGJrTP8 
It has always amazed me how we not only managed to send something into orbit, but we also managed to launch something else, and get that to the exact same spot, and at the exact same speed, to then have that attach to the first thing perfectly.
I haven't seen docking this sexy since I rented *Man-Junk-tion Junction 8* from Family Video in '96.
I know that was sped up, but I still got anxiety when they got close to the door. You are going to fast!
That's a smoother connection than my charging cable going into my phone...
Was this automated or was there a guy with his thumb on a joystick and his brow furrowed in concentration?
No one show this to the flat-earthers.. We don't need a massive aneurism on our hands.
Surprising how similar it looks to herbal space program. Never ceases to amaze, that game!
My buddies dad is one of the guys in the control room in Dulles for this. I got to go in a week ago and see their feed of the ISS. It was pretty amazing. 
How fast are they traveling? relative to each other, or maybe relative to earth. Whatever would make it easier to comprehend. 
Much improved if viewed while listening to [No Time for Caution](/r/interstellar/comments/2n4hin/no_time_for_caution_fixed_version_1/)
Does anyone know how the iss accounts for any momentum exchanged from the capsule? Does it have its own thrusters or does the capsule adjust for it?
How is this done? Remotely, or is it all programmed and pre-determined? 
My brain added the "capture clunk-clunk-clunk" sound from the movie Apollo 13.
I need to hear the docking song form interstellar playing while watching this
So how long did this take in real time? Looks like with how fast the earth is rotating it took hours to even get close enough to dock.
Very cool! I have never seen a capsule docking from this perspective. I usually watch the procedures on NASA TV. 
How does the ISS keep the same orientation as it orbits the earth? It's always cupola down but how do they keep it that way?

Just watched the Martian last night. Man I have never felt more anxious from watching a movie.
This is as it is expected to be when we live in space like in the movies. I keep repeating it over and over, it's so awesome like drone wars and drone racing.

If KSP tought me anything then it's that this maneuver requires much much more thought, planning and precision than you'd expect from two things connecting.  
Meanwhile back here on earth...

I know the video is sped up, but what causes them to drift/wobble from each other at the end there?  Is there "space wind gusts" or something causing them to minutely drift from each other?
How to the planning and forward thinking that has to go into this is amazing! Plus the stunning view.
Up takes you back,  
Back takes you down,  
Down takes you forward,  
Forward takes you up.
It's much like showing the first Neanderthals fire. It's amazing when one sees for the first time but the first human space flight was in 1961. It's not a single feat, but a culmination of over a half century of human advancement. It's amazing what we can accomplish when we aren't trying to kill each other 
Just an amazing reminder of what we are capable of once we stop killing and arguing about everything. 
This video clearly demonstrates that gravity is about falling. It took me a while to get the 'floating in space' idea out of my head. The ISS is just falling around the Earth, amazing.
I feel uneasy looking at this sped up. Feels like it's going to crash
"It's impossible"

"No, it's necessary"

DUN DUN DUN DUM DIM DUM DIM DUM DUM DUM DIM DUM
It's cool how when it gets really close you can tell how dark space really is.
So what exactly is that rotating device that gets retracted at the end of the video just prior to docking?  Is it something thats stabilizing through gyroscopic movement?  Apologies if this is a stupid question.
Was this docking planned to be during a period of time when the earth blocks the sun? Just imagined how tough it would be to get ideal visuals from your equipment during direct sunlight exposure.
is there a video of what its like inside the ISS during a docking? Im curious what it sounds like. 
So what happens if something goes wrong and they miss the docking? Would they have a second chance? Would the capsule fall back to earth? 
That's very cool but I want to see the very beginning to the end. Like that movie "lord of war" where the bullet is being made and than used. That's what i'd love to see but with rockets. 
Whats insane is the length of travel it took around the world until it docked.
Nominally, the solar arrays rotate in a paddle wheel motion to track the sun. In special situations like this docking they're locked in place to mitigate structural loading concerns. 
haha , I watched the whole 1hr 30 mins of this from the original video
All I heard was the Interstellar score during the docking scene. Insane.
Seems recklessly fast. They should slow the fuck down. Don't want to lose Jeb.
There are people who are smart enough to design a way to make two giant metal constructions flying around in space connect, yet *I* still can't figure out the correct trajectory needed to throw a crumpled up paper ball into my trash can that's like 10 feet away.
That looks like an orbital mechanics problem. Hopefully I don't fail my vector dynamics class so I can take orbital mechanics.
You're supposed to comm the station before docking so you can see the green line. Amateurs.
I want someone to put a face on it and post it to r/reallifedoodles.
no, no... THIS had to be done.

Anyone human given the knowledge can build a rocket, put it into space, and maneuver it around.  So far as even mining and smelting the aluminum and other metals, and creating the atmospheric and oil distillation machinery to make liquid oxygen and liquid fuel themselves.  It's all very basic concepts brought together for something unique.   You could grow some corn in a field and a extract fuel that could get you into space.   
      
A single person doing it would take a lifetime of work.  When you stick 5000 people together they can (and do) put it all together it all in about a month given the knowledge from research.   The research is the hard bit, but we all stand on the shoulders of giants.    
     
I do believe that if technology would advance sufficiently, any person could one day fly an aircraft or spacecraft just as easily as we drive ground vehicles.   I'm sending this message as a passenger in a ground vehicle cruising at speeds that used to be unheard of in human civilization.   I am certain that I could manually dock a spacecraft with very minor computer input, if I had a good understanding of the vehicle systems and maybe a pad of paper.    
    
I believe that space travel will eventually be as common as air travel and that air travel will be as common as ground travel.  Look at quadcopter right now, that technology is amazing and is being scaled up as we speak.  
    
I think the biggest hurdle will be getting to the point where we are as okay with air and space vehicle deaths as we are with ground vehicle deaths.  When you increase the number of people using a technology, you are bound to increase the number of fatalities resulting from it.     
This looks like a scene from a sci-fi movie...I'm not gonna lie things like this are 99.9% of the reason why I study engineering 
It still amuses me that people still think that the earth is flat. I mean just look at those curves. 
Does anyone know if it was really moving that fast? Or is the video speed up?
The flat earther's will say this is nasa cgi fuckery and it's all fake, so is the iss spacestation.😂😂💯
Every once in a while in this sometimes seemingly dimly lit world I see something that makes me grin inside and think, "You know for apes, we're not bad."
The guys who did the math to make this happen must look at "flat earthers" with disgust 
Think about this for a second. There are **still** people out there who think that Earth is **flat**.
Flat-Earthers, or whatever you call those nutjob conspiracists, should be made to watch this gif. Sure they'll find some way to call it fake though.

Having played KSP, this gave me so much anxiety. I took an hour just to recover a launcher for 4 satalites that ran out of fuel. Fuck. 
This may be a dumb question but can the iss spin to make artificial gravity like they do in the movie Armageddon?
I can't get a sense of scale here.. how big are these things? Is that weird shaped thing the ISS?  How large is that? (both the thing I'm looking at, and the ISS if that is something else)
So when these two things first get into synchronized orbit with one another is the capsule moving far faster than the ISS? While it gradually slows down in order to maintain that synchronization? 
I'm shooting a time lapse right now. And it is stupid and sucks compared to this.
Seeing it like this kind of makes me think that the ocean and space aren't so different, just that vast Black Sea
The GIF was sped up making it seem as if the station and the capsule are both moving across the Earth at extreme speeds. The original video is a more accurate representation of the time frame. Still fast, relative to us, of course.
I realize this video is sped up, but I really expected the capsule to appear to slow down as it neared the ISS.
I need to show this to my kerbals, they still make a huge mess of docking operations.
I can't even survive a minute in a BF4 helicopter without crashing hysterically.
I know it's obviously sped up, but that final docking approach looked rough, very Kerbal. I call the technique "Kinetic Docking Alignment" myself, which is a highly technical way of "ram it hard enough to swing my ship in to position and lock on."
That is so amazing!!! Doesn't get anymore real then that but it looks like something from a movie!!
The docking bit felt somewhat unflattering. I mean the whole thing is still mind-bogglingly fantastic, but that last 'thump' docking felt a bit amateurish. 

/runs
I missed the Earth in the backround the first time watching. Then proceeded to watch another five times just to look at Earth.
Is that a meteoroid or space junk that zooms past on the left side of the screen about half way through?  
(It's right after one of the flashes).

I think it goes good with [this audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdNVlxy8jVE&list=FLdCmOqoxgWs5YfKQrmXJt7Q&index=2)
All I see is me trying to dock on KSP without adding RCS thrusters...
https://youtu.be/GiJ6Il5Oki4?t=478

In case you needed a soundtrack.
Out of curiosity, how fast was this video sped up? Just wondering about the time lapse. Awesome video!
Interstellar Docking theme was playing in my head as soon as the video started. 
[deleted]
I wonder how fast this happened.. the connection looks like it hits hard. 
How sped up is this? What's the actual speed the ISS is orbiting too?
Makes me think of that extremely intense docking scene from Interstellar! Amazing
Oh boy am I drunk and this made be dizzy as hell. brb, going to throw up.
OK, this may be a stupid question but, how much time did this manoeuvre actually take ?
They don't retract the solar panels 1st? Have they learned nothing from KSP?

/S
It really blows me away sometimes that space is all relative. This gif really reminded me of that.
Someone put this to the interstellar docking scene music by hans zimmer please 
sometimes I don't believe any of this is real and we're all in the Matrix
That's freaking nuts. It's so precise, while it's flying insanely fast around the Earth, it's also rotating in 3D and then laser-abrupt orienting motions... damn.
Who else had the music from Interstellar’s docking scene playing in their head as they watch this?
damn, that was exciting!!  happiness restored to manageable levels.  
All I could think of when watching this, "Analyse the endurances spin".
This 26 minute zero gravity space docking is really something to watch and learn for people who use 26 minutes to parallell park.
What speed are they going. I though it would be a lot slower and smoother.
[It had to be done...](https://gifsound.com/?gifv=WNG2Iqq&v=lkzWF1UE1CI&s=100)
Don't bother trying to get to Mun or Duna or something crazy first off. I'm a few dozen hours in, and have a bunch of junk in orbit around Kerbin. Eventually, I'll do another rendezvous with Mun, and have a satellite there, too.
Sorry if this sounds stupid but why would they choose to dock in the dark than where it is bright?!

And I though space has no air, I'm always amazed how precisely they control direction and speed with thrusters where there is no air.  
So like, what's it take to get onto the ISS now adays? Also what are they even doing up there anymore? Haven't they run out of experiments to do yet?
What is the little doodad spinning around in the upper right that stops spinning as it gets closer?  Is that some type of radar that only works at some minimum distance?
It's not possible!
No, it's necessary. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3lcGnMhvsA
How long would that take in real time? Or in other words, what kind of speed would it be going when it docks? 
I show this...to the next jerk that can't get their car inbetween the lines at a store parking lot. Say really?!. And, walk away...
Anyone got a relatively short eli5 how this works? It looks really weird how they stop so suddenly (relative to each other) whilst rotating into position across the different planes.
The fact that people are willing to be strapped to a massive rocket and blown into space is insane. Much respect for anyone who does this. I'm scared of getting on an airplane. 
They made that look a lot easier, than I thought it work out to be.
How does cold welding not occur during this process?  Clearly the scientists behind this are smart enough to get this to work and wouldn't go to all this effort to flake and allow cold welding to occur.  My initial thought is that it's two different metals but maybe it's something else.... Is there a particular rule during the build process that all companies go by that male/female parts have a particular metal that must be used? Does anyone know the answer to this?
It makes me sad the top comment is from "im too stupid"

for once id like to see the "this is what i was born as a human to do" comment
Hans Zimmer is having an orchestra playing "No time for caution"  on my head as I watch this
I can recommend to do a Ground-to-ISS mission in [Orbiter](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/). They have a nice How-To PDF which really teaches you some orbital mechanics and docking procedure stuff.
**The math and technology that go into making this work blows my fucking mind.**
You guys up there, and down here for that matter; you are amazing! Seriously - who needs magic when this shit is real?
Not a scientist.... how come that initial impact doesn't knock ISS off course?
That's a similar pattern I approach a girl with at a bar, and the same robotic drunken behavior 
I know its sped up, but my butt still clenched at that approach speed.
Its like me when i try to dock my ship in Elite Dangerous. Expect this is MUCH precise....very much precise.
the automated docking procedure from the old elite, amirite?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-VJeVPeawk
Just for the record, are the ISS and the Soyuz capsule not moving and it's just the earth rotating?

Astronauts/Cosmonauts are just so out of this world impressive. They're the best of us. Well, outside of Lisa Nowak. But she is smart as hell, so there's that.
God we are truly born in the worst generation. In the coming centuries we will accomplish so much. This amazing feat we all just saw will be as the sling to the gun. We can all conceptualize just how fascinating the future will be, an universe left unexplored, but we will die with just that: An imagination 
OK, so now I understand why THAT particularly extreme sex act is called 'space-docking'
Why does it dock from above? Wouldn't it take less energy to dock directly from below?  
After reading many of these comments I'm very disappointed in the lack of knowledge here. CGI is what NASA uses with all of their pictures. Take some time and figure out that nobody has ever been into outer-space. Continue on to understand that nobody has been on the moon understanding simply because all the facts are out there.

What NASA dominance? Am I the only one who remembers that our space shuttle program is over?
It would look like a star, much like all of the other planets you can see with the naked eye. Remember, though, it's dependent on the conditions of light pollution, interference, angle with the sun, etc.
Could you see it unaided? Almost certainly. Would it look like anything special? Probably not. Just another point of light in the sky unless you had a telescope to discern the planetary disk. From here, even Jupiter just looks like a very bright star without a scope.

Elon Musk, please get me a seat on your Mars Ship. I want to get off this planet.
Oh not the 20km-high-cliff figure. Didn't this turn out to me an over-estimation?

Wikipedia says yes

>It also has the largest known cliff in the Solar System, Verona Rupes, which has a height of over **5 km** (3.1 mi)

In that case, it's probably tied with lots and lots of 'tallest cliff' candidates from around the solar system. Lava flows at the base of Olympus Mons are 5km high, the [deepest canyon in the solar system](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/a-super-grand-canyon-on-pluto-s-moon-charon) (Argo Chasma, Pluto's moon Charon) probably has cliffs exceeding 5km but it was imaged in very poor detail, there's a 5km high cliff in the himalayas...


Forget jumping off. Let's finance a trip to climb it. I'll volunteer to pick up the lead. Any capable interplanetary belayers here?
No one is fighting over anything, humans cannot get themselves beyond low earth orbit, let alone back to the Moon, nor Mars for that fact.

also, keep in mind that budget for NASA covers a ton of Earth specific based science and has nothing related to actually going out into Space.
I say bring it. It'll inspire competition. And despite that, all space exploration efforts are a human one. I'm a proud American, but space exploration goes beyond national pride. It's about the human spirit. No matter who's doing it, they represent us all. 
This is actually awesome to see. The more funding and competition, the better.
Competition got us to the moon, hopefully this will spark a race to Mars and beyond 
our local cub scout rocketry group is a threat to NASA's dominance in Space and the next 4 to 8 years is going to be much.. much worse.
Any resemblence of "NASA’s Dominance" is only because of countries like China and Russia pushing into space. If those countries didnt, NASA would have been gutted.

NASA still fights the perception of public worth. What is NASA worth to the average joe? When there is no objective or enemy, politicians are hard press to push huge science contracts.

NASA wont be anywhere close to what it use to be unless NASA becomes part of the defense solution of the US. Meaning they get funded because it's deemed critical for the defense of the US, in which case they will have a blank check and their objective is to beat the "enemy".

Until then the general public would not care nor would they be any wiser.

What will happened is China will suddenly have an edge, like Sputnik, in which case the US will suddenly care and push hard. They will be edged out again and again by China, until it's a race to see who can out spend and out science each other. The US has won on two occasion already just by out spending, will they repeat a 3rd time??? Sounds like a familiar story? Time to hit those history books...
We are 2 years away from the 50th anniversary of the first Moon landing. A half century since we had the capability to go to the Moon, land, drive around on an electric car and return.  
  
It is looking more and more likely the US and European governments have no space program at all in another 20 years. The speed of terminating the Apollo program is precedence for what can happen in the coming years for the Western nations.  Musk won't be able to save the day because he is depending on US government contracts to keep going.  
  
You see it in the news every day. The US space program keeps going further and further out, with missions for the next half century that don't involve manned space travel. We are being told there is no return to the Moon planned because "we have already been there, there is nothing to learn" or "the Moon is too harsh with too many problems that Mars won't have". Meanwhile, Mars keeps getting pushed further and further out in time.  
  
The Chinese have been saying for several years, they will concentrate on a space station and going to the Moon. Going to the Moon isn't to play golf, it is to put telescopes on, prospect for resources, and investigate extended visits.  The government space agency is starting to plan for Space Tourism, with their Hainan launch complex. The US is leaving that to commercial enterprise. Europe doesn't even talk about space tourism.  
  
This recent agreement between Russia, China, Japan, and South Korea to co-operate together to develop an Asian Continent Power Network might be a sign of things to come. If the Chinese, Russian and Japanese space agencies start working together, the US space program is going to look like an old man on his rocking chair on the front porch.
While I wish China the best, its increasing indebtedness and rising non-performing loans are likely going to pinch the national budget long before reaching parity with the U.S.
If China's space program reaches parity with the US the world will be a safer place. The way things are at the moment, any conflict between east and west will put an end to space exploration. Several more anti satellite missiles from China, and LEO and GEO are lost to us. Space is one our largest advantages against them and they will try and level the playing field unless they are are just as dependent on it as we are. 
Shouldn't be too hard - just start putting stuff up there... moon, lagrange points, maybe some asteroid mining... 

Meanwhile in the U.S. the government is infiltrated with morons, some of whom are certain their god is telling them the earth is flat.

Mars is about 200 million km away on average and is bright in the sky to the naked eye.  It's also smaller and further away from the sun.  So yes, it would be easy to spot unless in silhouette. 
You are in luck we have pretty much exactly that kind of picture. Curiosity the newest robot on Mars as taken a picture of Earth and it [looks like this](http://www.space.com/images/i/000/036/710/original/mars-rover-curiosity-earth-photo.jpg). Mars is between 50 to 400 million km away. 

On Earth, looking at Mars or Venus gives you a good idea of what Earth would look like from a few hundred million kilometers.

Edit : it appears that the picture was taken when Earth was 160 million kilometers from Mars.

Article author is uneducated on tech. Claims that Internet and system time stamps are satellite-reliant. Truth is that the internet is built on a backbone of land cables, and that the same time data being pumped up to GPS is obtainable from the same source over the same cables as NTP data.

MESSENGER doesn't exist anymore. It ran out of fuel and was vaporized in impact with Mercury like a year ago. And there wasn't an eclipse this week.
And by "this week's" you mean the one 2 years ago? Still, this is on par with "pale blue dot" in existential awesomeness. 
This must be a repost, considering the title. MESSENGER crashed against Mercury a year+ ago, and on your own GIF it says 2014-10-08, which is not precisely this week eclipse, specially when there wasn't one this week.

I dont remember them publishing a scientific paper, or if they did it wasnt very well publicised. However I do remember one of the cassini mission scientists talking at a press conference (cant remember which one sorry) quite a few months ago that the data from the flyby indicated that the ocean had a ph of 11, which is highly alkali and indicates serpentisation is occuring at the sea floor (a chemical reaction that occurs at hydrothermal vents and could be an energy source for life)

This info all came from a scientist who was attending the conference and live-tweeting the speakers,  so there's no article or further info I can link to sorry. People on twitter often live-tweet planetary science conferences, they're not always livestreamed. Guess we'll have to wait until a paper is released for details.

-------
Edit: The results of the flyby will be announced some time around December, according to [this](http://www.space.com/32021-how-life-friendly-is-enceladus-ocean.html) article /u/bobsmo found!
mostly chocolate with trace elements of nuget, peanut butter and hazelnuts. It took so long to identify because the researchers kept eating the samples. 
Yes, I've been also anxiously awaiting this data!

I suspect you are secretly eager to see that data for the same reason that I am secretly eager to see that data ("aliens!")?

So ya, like you, I've been trying to contemplate and read between the lines about why it's taking so long... 

Personally, my main conclusion is this: 

I suspect if there had been a strong hint at life-detection, the scientists involved wouldn't have been able to contain themselves for this long! 

Yes at first they would say, "Calm down everyone... calm down... let's take a our time here..." but being human beings they wouldn't have been able to contain themselves for over 1 year like this, in making the greatest and most important announcement in human history thus far! 

They just wouldn't be able to do it. 

If there was a very strong signal of life, then hints about it would have almost certainly leaked out already! 

So sadly... I suspect it's probably a bad sign that it's taking so long for us to get the data and final report.

I think the final report will probably be very mundane in comparison to what we're secretly hoping for! 

--------------------------------

HOWEVER... 

If they got a frustrating ambiguous possible life detection... then yes... I can see them forcing themselves to delay and wait as they continue analysis and interpretations. 

We've seen 2 big ambiguous overly excited "possible life detection" announcements made before by NASA, perhaps prematurely, including of course: 

the 1970's Viking Mars lander experiments, and the 1990's ALH84001 Mars rock. 

So with ambiguous results, they probably don't want those scenarios coming up yet again, in front of the world press! So that could certainly delay them. 

--------------------------------

And of course the original scientists get first crack at the data, and have to write their papers, and then get those papers peer reviewed. 

And then they sometimes have to re-write their papers after peer review! 

All of this can often take about 1 year, give or take a few months. So I think we're still within the "normal" time frame. 

If it goes out to 1 year and 6 months, then I personally will begin to become surprised, and also a bit suspicious about what is exactly going on with that data and it's analysis. 

I think at that point they will begin to owe the scientific community (and the US tax payers who fund the mission!) some answers about that data, which many people are highly anticipating and waiting for eagerly. 

But yes... like you, I was very much hoping for an earlier data release. 

--------------------------------

EDIT: And of course the equipment involved in this doesn't involve proper life-finding instruments. 

NASA just happened to notice Enceladus had a bunch of awesome water-geysers erupting into space, and shrugged their shoulders, and said, "What the heck," and aimed the Cassini probe right through it! 

I imagine the impact with the material in the geysers was also a pretty high speed! 

So I'll think we will need proper life-potential finding missions to Enceladus and Europa as well. 
The results of the flyby will be announced some time around December, according to [this](http://www.space.com/32021-how-life-friendly-is-enceladus-ocean.html) article /u/bobsmo found
It does seem possible. Whether there actually are or not, I'm not sure if anyone could tell you for certain without actually seeing pictures of volcanoes [or geysers] from a "lander" breaking through the atmosphere.

While Neptune is a gas giant, it is not just a ball of gas, it has layers, layers of gases, liquids, and rocks. It has a mantle, a core, and an atmosphere like other planets. Ices[liquids] on Neptune largely consist of ammonia, methane, ammonium hydrosulfide, and water, with possible trace amounts of nitrogen. Temperatures on Neptune range from -218C at the cloud tops to 5,100C at the center. Pressures reach 10GPa at the center. It seems entirely possible, likely even that there would be at least some volcanoes or geysers, but they would likely consist of the ices mentioned previously, instead of nitrogen[due solely to its lack of abundance on Neptune]. 

[Wiki: Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune)
Well, seeing as Neptune is a gaseous planet it's kind of difficult to have volcanism as we typically think of it. There likely isn't a solid surface so it would just be gasses passing through other gasses, more like weather systems than volcanos.
I think if the spaceship is the only other object for your frame of reference, and relative to the spaceship you are not moving, then for all intents and puposes you can consider everything stationary.
Movement is relative. Moving at 17km/s in relation to what? Right now you are not moving in relation to your computer, but you are moving around the center of Earth, and around the Sun, and around the center of the galaxy, etc. You can place your frame of reference anywhere you want.

You could only know whether you are rotating over your own axis, in relation to everything else, because you would feel the centrifugal force.
[deleted]
I discovered how to move anywhere in the galaxy from reading posts here.
Basically put, you need to stop moving relative to everything. If the earth is orbiting the sun at x speed, and the sun is orbiting a black hole at y speed, and the black hold is orbiting another mass at z speed we are going very fast in multiple directions. If we can put create an opposite motion to all axis and come to a complete stop,  we will be going extremely fast relative to whats around us. Now you can choose a direction and blast off. going to bed
Being able to set up something on the moon would be an amazing accomplishment. We could then use it as a base to expand out. 
Also excellent are Brain Greene's "The Elegant universe" and "The Fabric of the Cosmos". Somewhat more theoretically inclined than Cosmos though.
I'll just add the obligatory note that of course r/Cosmos is a thing. 
I think the series was good and well intentioned, although personally, I prefer the original version, hosted by Sagan (as dated and lacking in killer visuals as it might be). 
I really enjoyed both the old and new Cosmos. 

The Sagan version was so poetic though. 
Tyson's version is pretty good.

But Sagan's original is far, far better.

Dude watch the old one. Tyson is cool but he isn't as amazing as Sagan was at explaining things.
Do yourselves a favor and get stoned beforehand. You won't regret it
Still waiting on a 2nd season. Watched all the way through like 12 times and like a brief history of time, each bit built up to the next to really define and explain concepts normally beyond grasp (at least for quite a few, including myself). Great show!
All the episodes of the original Cosmos are on You Tube. They have the updates tagged on to the end of each episode as well.
The [polar bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XXFUKJBOlM) segment of Cosmos was the very first time the concept of evolution really "clicked" with my wife. The school where she grew up in rural Idaho completely failed at explaining evolution, so the idea just seemed ridiculous to her up until that point.
I watched the original Cosmos.  I watched the new modern version with Tyson.

This meme sums it up nicely:
[Conversation with Pluto](http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/you-are-not-a-planet-pluto-you-are-not-carl-sagan.jpg)
Tyson's Cosmos was good, but it doesn't stand up to Brian Cox' 'Wonders of the Solar System' and 'Wonders of the Universe' series. Two of my favorite segments:

[Brian explains entropy using a sandcastle in a desert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQSoaiubuA0)

[Brian explores catastrophic flooding analogues for Mars on Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHWsJgarMtA)
I love Cosmos. Agreed that sometimes the narrative in some episodes might jump back and forth but I didn't find it hard to understand.
I'm an atheist, and a man of science, but even I find the historical cartoons cringe-inducingly biased. They leave out inconvenient truths that contradict their narrative. For example, that Giordano Burno was accused of plagiarizing Marsilio Ficino at Oxford. 

I don't want a narrative, with [comically villainous church clergy, and an ironically messianic hero](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/467915208_1280x720.jpg), I want to know the truth. Is that so bad?
I just finished episode 2 and my mind is completely blown. For the record, I'm not in science but I found it pretty easy to understand. I'm a visual learner so the images definitely help. Such a cool show. I had no idea a water bear existed until now. And the evolution of how the "eye" came to be. So fascinating. 
I recomend to see original "Cosmos: a personal voyage" first. Its my favorite series
I still really like it, if just because it conveys the sheer scale of the universe better than many shows.

My only beefs: it occasionally mischaracterizes people (Giordano Bruno wasn't really persecuted for his view of the universe, IIRC), and it's heavy-handed in its ideology -- albeit a good ideology (against religious persecution, pro-environment).
This series was absolutely amazing and very informative. I learned a lot watching it and unfortunately forgot most of it after a year. 
As much as I like NDT and that version... The best one for me is Sagan. It aired when I was 13.

It was one of the truly great memories from growing up. 
If you only have time to watch one, skip the commercial break cliffhangers and find Carl Sagan's original.
Although I like the content in the series something about Neil just drives me bonkers.  He seems like he is trying way to hard to be Carl Sagan and it just doesn't feel natural.  I do appreciate what he is doing to bring science to the general public but watching his video is painful and when he speaks with other leaders in the field it makes me cringe.  No doubt this will get plenty of downvotes but it's just my opinion.
Wasn't Seth MacFarlane executive producer on this as well? I still thought it was a decent mini series.
If you're expecting this to be completely about outer space, just adjust your expectations a bit. Neil DeGrasse Tyson does a decent (albeit cheesy at times) job of walking the audience through the cosmos for a few episodes, but he also goes down to the atomic and subatomic levels of energy. 

Eventually, he also covers the energy level between the enormity of the universe and the microscopic subatomic particles, and goes over nature, human existence, our scientific progression as a human race, and the like. 

TL;DR: don't go into it expecting a series full of comets, asteroids, planets, black holes, and galaxies. The series paints on a large canvas of science. Def 4/20 friendly. 
I enjoy 'How the universe works' much more. 5 seasons with scientists interviewed to help explain. so much more in-depth than Cosmos and much of it is narrated by Mike Rowe.  Sorry Sagan and Tyson.
The Sagan Cosmos is way way better. Tyson is proselytizing his religion of science bullshit while Sagan just wants to tell you about cool shit. I can't stand NDT any more he is such a diva (along with Hawking OMG Steve shut up about the damn computers).
I love this show. It brings back memories of staying up late into summer nights at my mom's old house watching it with my brother and stargazing, back when he didn't hate me. 

It's an absolutely masterful show that beautifully captures so much wonder in the world. ♥
The original series gave me chills. It felt so familiar somehow even when I watched it for the first time. Like a weird sense of deja vu in a really good way.
Indeed it's great, but still stays in the shadow comparing to its predecessor, the original "Cosmos" with Carl Sagan. His voice alone, full of passion, makes it astonishing. See the new one, but don't forget about the old one, it's a totally different experience. 
How nice- I just finished the first episode!

There is so much I'm curious about, and just didn't know where to begin. This series is a great introduction. 

Is the director really the same Seth Macfarlane that makes Family Guy? Seems like such a different path for him. 
This is a great place to start if you're curious about physics, and more specifically some obscure figures of scientific history. I personally like the original better - the style, the writing, Carl - but this is a fine series and well worth your time. 

Brian Cox's "Wonders" series are also ABSOLUTELY worth your time. Fewer CGI scenes (which I consider a good thing) - and yet still a remarkably creative series of explanations for scientific principles. He uses a sand castle to explain entropy - it's one of the cleverest things I've seen in a series like this. 
I used this show to fall asleep to. Not because it's boring - It's really not - But because Neil deGrasse Tyson has such a soothing voice, when speaking on this show.
 
I wish I could buy this series, as a download, instead of having to stream it.
Caveat: Don't watch it if you're sleepy, Neil Degrasse Tyson has such a soothing voice. It's like Fergie and Jesus.
I just made my girlfriend watch an episode of this last night! She wouldn't stop groaning but after 10 minutes was hooked and she kept being like whatttt wtf that just blew my mind
New Cosmos sucked. Carl Sagan's OG version is the version to watch. Much more interesting, less graphics BS, great explanations and he builds up a foundation for you before getting into more advanced material.
The original series that was hosted by Carl Sagan was better IMO. His love for science really carried the show. Tyson's is OK but Sagan's was like poetry. 
Ah yes, Cosmos.  
Back when Neil DeGrasse Tyson was still cool.   
Still I find it miraculous that a program shown on Fox, and directed by Brannon Braga: the person who made the science in Star Trek: Voyager ridiculous , came out so informative.  
That being said, I was disappointed that they misrepresented and took side on some historical figures whose legacies are much more debatable than the show presents.

Hard to understand? I've found this show to be insanely comprehensive.
We watched a lot of these in science last year whenever my teacher was out.  They were great.
I kid you not....I go to sleep at night with this streaming on my Netflix at least two or three times a week.  
Love this and How The Universe Works.
We need more like Cosmos. In the same style as Sagan's and this. Aimed squarely at the common American. Aim higher, and you'll lose the attention of the masses.
I am going to agree that this series is GREAT for people who like BROAD interpretations the cosmos, some history, but mostly space. However - if you like specifics in the things you read about this is not for you. Its so great but leaves you wanting more specifics about things.
You know what pisses me off.  They have this on Netflix, but NOT CARL SAGANS VERSION!? 
I love this show. We homeschool our children and I use this show as part of our science curriculum. 
There's a lot of bullshit [history](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/23o92d/on_cosmos_neil_degrassetyson_said_some_historians/) though.
I try to rewatch this show annually at least. There's really something for anyone with a bit of curiosity. It's so captivating and magical. 
This series really broke it all down for me and help me to really understand the current theories behind our universe.
Didn't like it. It looks really cool but i had the feeling that the way he represented this knowledge was bad. I had the sense of watching something and nothing.
After I saw it on TV I bought it on DVD it was so good. It's a must watch
I prefer Carl Sagans original over the  newer Tyson ones. 

Actually, Brian Cox has a number of series on the BBC that are first rate. He is very good at explaining complex things. 

Tyson seems stoned most of the time

This review is the best.

https://youtu.be/Zd3Y1tCwlBo

It only gets better with unsubstantiated down votes.:)
The problem I have with this show is it's not an adult show.  This is an example of the infantilization of educational content aimed at adults.  

This show is essentially a kids show.
Hard to understand? In my opinion, it's actually too dumbed down sometimes. I'm not saying i'm a genius and i understand everything, but this is some pretty complex stuff, which can't be simplified properly.

Most of the time, however, it's awesome. Watch in on a big screen tv if you have the chance.
It's absolutely sad that you'd link to the new version over the timeless and transcendent classic. Watch *Carl Sagan's* Cosmos, you scrubs.
Yes!!! This show literally changed my life. I used to be really religious. Then I watched this show and I realized why religion is wrong. 
I know Cosmos gets a lot of love on Reddit and obviously also here on /r/Space, but am I the only one who finds it incredibly cringe-y and almost impossible to watch?
History's The Universe is great, particularly the first season, and it doesn't get as preachy as new Cosmos.
I enjoyed it but thought they spent too much time on the historical aspect.  I want to know more about what's going on now, and what's to come in the future.
It's fun even if you understand science well already. The visuals lone are really great.
My problem with is that his voice is so comforting I keep falling asleep. 
Agree, I'm quite a noob but have watched a few of these episodes and made me feel better. Very calm and entertaining series too.
I consider myself somewhat knowledgable when it comes to science, physics and astronomy; I still was completely enthralled by *Cosmos*. I think it's got something for everyone!
Does it have a lot of visuals or is it mostly shots of people talking? My nephew loves space but a lot of the stuff on Science is 80% scientists talking and the rest are visuals, and at 4 I don't expect him to find watching a grown up talk all that exciting for an extended period. 

I would LOVE some kind of cartoon or something like the magic school bus but about space for him. 
The thing that I loved the MOST about the series was the animation storytelling. If someone depicted all of scientific history like that, I bet it would spark a lot of interest in younger age groups.
Also, Carl Sagan's Cosmos series is amazing in every way. his voice is sooo soothing.
They put the entire existence of the universe into a 12 month calendar for perspective. Our industrial revolution started on the last second of the last day of December or something along those lines. Definitely smoke before watching. 
This show was the most popular in the world for some time, then GoT over took it.
"Moon Shot" from JJ Abrams is another great one! 9 episodes:

http://lunar.xprize.org/news/blog/moon-minute-holiday-spirit-jj-abrams-moon-shot
First night a binge watched a few episodes of Cosmos, when I went to bed I had a wicked dream, I was on Venus, Jupiter and whatever other planet in our solar system I felt like visiting. 

It was lucid and I knew I shouldn't be able to survive on any of these planets, but the dream continued, it was awesome! 
Greg Franklin and the animation crew at 6 Point Harness don't get enough credit for the quality behind the scenes work they did on this series.
A Brief (illustrated) History Of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell by Stephen Hawking are excellent for grasping higher order physics as well. 
For those who miss the Carl Sagan version, Demetri Martin has a great parody series called "Our Fascinating Planet".

Link for the lazy:

1) I would also recommend the original series this is based on: Cosmos.  It's hosted by Carl Sagan and I think the writing was even more approachable and easy to understand.  
2) What is it about the series people find hard to understand?  I am just curious because I'm interested in science communication.  Is it that the ideas are too new?  Analogies not used enough?  Analogies used too liberally to the point you lose track?  Do you notice any patterns in what is difficult?
Jacob Bronowski's Ascent of Man is on par with Cosmos IMO, really wonderful series. 

Here's the playlist

I hope you like it
how many seasons are there? I only have 1 season on Netflix and planned to watch it in the near future
This is the series that kicked off my love of space and science. Ever since it aired i've been a nut. As I work I usually have some sort of panel or debate playing. Why wasn't I this interested when i was in school -.-
I like the series but you forgot to mension that is also for people who don't believe in God... 
I watch it when I'm high. One time I fell asleep with my laptop next to me while watching and passed out half on my laptop. When I woke up the weight of my body on the laptop had cracked the trackpad a bit. Don't Cosmos and Weed fum
I really did not like this series & was disappointed, it came across as being produced to make science easy-to-understand for sheltered Christian kids.
Are there any talks or intentions known of them bringing this show back for more seasons?

It's a great series for people who *do* understand it too. It's just a great series!
I still use my ex roommates' Netflix account after I moved away. They're all serious creationists. Now, every once in a while I go to each of the profiles and play an episode of Cosmos so it appears in their "continue watching" section. It's my ongoing roommate revenge since they never changed their password!

On a related note, anyone know of similar scientific shows in the kids section of Netflix?
How there hasn't been a second season yet I have no idea. Season one was absolutely beautiful.  
This series got me through some looong nights up with my newborn son. 

Also the content was a+ 
I found the original Cosmos much better and easier to understand. But Carl Sagan was a god.
Oh my god, I loved it! I watched two or three episodes and just was gaping like a fool the whole time! I loved them! It's so good! :D 
Here's a [link](http://ihavenotv.com/series/cosmos-a-spacetime-odyssey) to the whole series. Enjoy!
This is the show that finally explained science enough to me for me to stop believing in a god.  I feel much more informed, now.  
...seriously OP?  Do you think there are people who haven't heard of this yet?
Carl Sagan's *Cosmos: A Personal Voyage* is wonderful if you want to learn how enough knowledge of the natural world can make everything seem magical. 

That's the key difference in both versions I think. Tyson's is informative, Sagan's is enlightening. Of course both have the aspects of both, but one predominates. 
Just started watching this yesterday - stumbled across the startalk podcast last week and have become super interested in so many new things! I have definitely learned a lot! 
The 'calendar' perspective really puts into perspective just how fucking old the universe is. Absolutely fascinating.
This needs to be shown in public schools. I've got no doubt there are great science teachers out there, but this series does a near perfect job of making everything sound both fascinating and accessible at the same time. 
OK, the original was great,  but it's 35 years old.....  Why are so many people shitting on the new one?  We didn't even prove the middle stages of accretion until the mid 2000s.
And Neil DeGrasse Tyson is the best!!! I wish scientists had trading cards like baseball...just musing on Reddit, I guess
Watch the episode(s) on climate change of you're a denier.  He lays it out very well and addresses a lot of the claims by the people who argue against it existing. 
I wish they did more than one season though. I understand Mr. Tyson is a business person with his speaking engagements, interviews, and research for his actual job, but it's my personal opinion the him doing a series like this was a great service to those outside the scientific community. it makes the subject more approachable for the average person. 

I've also got a feeling it was a big deal to him personally and emotionally given he was doing the direct followup to his mentors show of the same name. I get his reasons for only doing the one season, I guess I'm just being a bit selfish in wishing he did more. 
I watch this all the time! Definitely helped aided my curiosity of space! 10/10 would rewatch again 
I think he dumbs it down as far as it will go, so I don't really see why it would be difficult to understand. The whole premise of the show is to explain the methods, and most influential discoveries of science in a way that most people can understand. 

In fact I think he doesn't go into enough detail about most topics, and he heavily relies on the visuals to do the explaining for him. Carl Sagan did a much better job of explaining the topics for the scientific illiterate, and goes into the real concrete details of the topics I find. I would highly recommend watching the Carl Sagan version of Cosmos for those who wish to understand the concepts in better detail.

If you want to see some nice visuals without a lot of substance, I would watch the NDT Cosmos. But I am an engineer so I am obviously really biased.
I found the new Cosmos really lacking. It was basically a history lesson on science, rather than about science.

I think Brian Cox's documentary series "The Wonders of the Universe," "The Wonders of the Solar System," and "The Wonder of Life" were far, far superior. Plus Cox has the Sagan vibe that NDT is severely lacking.
Am I the only one who hated this show? I was super excited for it. It was too geared to children. I get it, but I didn't think there was much there and the history lessons were weird. 
inb4 downvotes, but the 2014 sequel is vastly dumbed down compared to the 1980 original. It's also unnecessarily politically charged because Seth MacFarlane can't help but do that to everything he touches.

BBC *Wonders of the Universe*, *Wonders of the Solar System* and *Wonders of Life* are far more relevant.
You might get more out of youtube's pbs.  Cosmo is a little to flashy for me.
Can't take Tyson anymore.    He seems pretty happy to be...Neil Tyson
Hard to unserstand?  Did you drop out of middle school or something?
I love this one

However my dad still wont believe in climate change
If you don't mind Neil Tyson DeGrasse talking to you like you are 6 years old.  
This series was a disappointment.  Its really not worth watching dumb'd down and preachy science.  If anyone is actually interested in some science then watch the original COSMOS with Carl Sagan.
No. cosmos is a pile of shit.

Watch The Universe series. 

Cosmos is like a diet soda where cosmos is classic coke
I guess I am part of the minority who found it pretty mediocre. Tyson is ok as host, but the content wasn't anything groundbreaking, some of the production values, like the cartoons, were pretty weak, and much of the historical content is laughably biased and misleading, particularly in its efforts to exaggerate the conflict between religious institutions and science.

It is basically exactly what a stereotypical redditor (late teens , early twenties, likes science on a fairly shallow level, atheistic and strongly anti religion) would want in a show. As far as an actual program on science and space, it's pretty average.
Things are really big and things are really small. Also, the big things are small and small things are big. The universe is amazing!
Take it with a grain of salt tough, especially the historical scenes because they prefer drama over actual facts just to make it more exciting to watch.
Funny how in almost every scene he has to get into his "imagination mobile", but yet theist are the ones who believe in non sense  
The black guy was nothing on Carl....the black guy is to condescending. ..Carl was an engaging magician of knowledge and words.
This is a very well produced video! I'd be exited to see more of your work.
...and will be sending this to me via FedEx, UPS or good ol' USPS because it's the holiday season and he's a fantastic human being. Thank you.
How big would a model of mars be if he kept building all of mars in this scale?
Where do we buy these and can I get one of the current location of Curiosity with the rover on it as well?    

I wonder if anyone at NASA has thought about using a big 3D printer to recreate a future landing site on Mars to practice roving here on Earth.     

Or maybe we can get a Disney World ride where they recreate the path of Curiosity and you ride along it.  That would be neat.  
Amazing! I wish i had acces to a 3D printer, imagne the fun.
How long did it take to print?
That's just some fancy TLI (trans-lunar injection) via [Earth-Sun L1 point](http://ccar.colorado.edu/asen5050/projects/projects_2012/wolma/#extension). All of Apollo injections were ordinary direct injections, like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Trans-lunar_injection.svg/800px-Trans-lunar_injection.svg.png)
This is the GRAIL mission trajectory. Here's a link to more about the trajectory: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Recovery_and_Interior_Laboratory#Transit_phase

Basically it saves a little on fuel compared to the Apollo missions. 
Just to chime in, the spiral out maneuver you're probably referring to is called a Hohmann transfer.

Math is always good - minor in it at least, I would think. 

But other options: Structural and/or mechanical engineering (for building vehicles), physics - especially astrophysics, botany (what can be grown to eat in space?), medicine & physiology, even nutrition. If you can afford it in both time & money, I would also look into getting a pilots' license. 

But above all else, I'd look at the various internships and summer-camp type things that you could do *in addition* to your formal school work. The contacts and 'insider knowledge' you gain in such places will be worth as much as your degree.
Programming and data mining. Large telescopes generate a tremendous amount of data that needs to be collected and analyzed. 
Not sure if this is true or not, but I heard once that NASA employees more computer scientists than it does aerospace engineers. 
"Space related" is incredibly broad. I'm a professional astrophysicist and work along side people with majors in math, chemistry, physics, astrophysics, astronomy, numerous variations of engineering, computer/computational science, and various combinations/nuances of the above, plus some degrees I've forgotten about. Long story short, you need to pick something that aligns somewhat with your career goals and interests but don't back yourself into a corner at this stage. Keep it broad at undergrad and narrow down as you progress to grad school. If in doubt, physics + math undergrad will get you going in the right general direction but you'd be wise to get more focussed at grad school.

Oh, and the intern suggestion from /u/wdjm is a very important one. Outside of academia, a large number of jobs in this field are obtained by word of mouth, not by advertisements or jobs postings. Internships get you contacts and real-world experience - it's invaluable in a very competitive job market. 
Could always get a sweeping job at NASA like that guy in the sound testing chamber.
Morty you can't just had a ski-fi word to *BURP* something and make it real Morty.
no.

there have been some concepts of light getting slower/tired over time, and they were pretty nonsensical and easily falsified.
It would be far simpler to terraform Mars than the Moon. Holding onto an atmosphere depends on gravity and temperature. The moon is fairly close to the sun (on a solar system scale) and so it would need a lot of gravity for the atmosphere not to just boil away. The moon is simply too small. 
Mars has a similar composition as Earth, in fact some things are found in higher concentrations in the soil. 

Mars has plenty of

- Iron

- Oxygen locked up in the regolith (oxides, mostly iron oxide) which can be released by heating the regolith

- 821,000 cubic kilometers of water ice in the northern cap alone

- Enough CO2 locked up in the caps to give Mars an atmosphere that would be of a pressure high enough for humans to walk around without pressure suits if released, a 5C increase in average Martian temperature would cause a runaway greenhouse effect that would cause the eventual melting of enough material from the caps (and the regolith over the entire planet) to thicken the atmosphere. This can be done by generating fluorocarbons or creating a 125km 'mirror' in orbit and reflecting sunlight onto the planet. 

- Likely geothermal sources which could provide cheap energy and heating for habitats, likely as the planet has seen volcanic activity 'recently' geologically

- Roughly the same amount of landmass as on earth for eventual use

Sending manned missions to Mars should take priority over all other manned/robotic space exploration for the next 50-100 years. We need people exploring Mars and one or more colonies started. 


----

The moon has 

- ice, in extremely small amounts

- has no atmosphere of note

- has considerably less gravity

- has regolith that is essentially pulverized stone with the Lunar dust being 10 microns or smaller which clings to everything, can increase radiative heat transfer which is bad, is very very abrasive, gets into gaskets and can compromise their ability to seal with relative ease, and with regular exposure (entering air locks with dusty suits... you can only get them so clean) will almost certainly lead to all sorts of lung problems relatively quickly 

- The night lasts 13.65 days (Mars has a night similar in length to one on Earth) and the day lasts 13.65 days.

Etc
Before you ask a question like this, you should at least understand how terraforming Mars would likely be accomplished. Once you lean about that, you'd understand why the Moon is not a candidate for terraforming. Do your research, Junior.
I enjoyed this movie very much but do not think there will be a sequel. (I also don't want one) A sequel would only truly be interesting if it was 3000 years in the future and I believe our lack of knowledge would make it costly and less grounded in reality than the original.
I did find it interesting to think on the fact she is able to alter the future and possibly the past. The aliens could have used this power to travel back 3000 years and instead decide to go to earth instead of whatever they were doing to ask for help. 
ugh,
tldr;
A sequel would truly ruin it if its not executed correctly. 
Unless you are way the hell out in the middle of nowhere, you have [light pollution](http://darksitefinder.com/maps/world.html) that is obscuring it.
Nothing. But if you've looked into how that's done, (the pretty photos) you realize how little information the human eye takes in. Check r/spaceporn and look for the photos where folks post the technical aspects of how the shot was done. 

Here's one I shared with a photog friend who loves Space photography: 
>"Unfortunately Milky Way season is now over. Although the Milky Way is actually visible year round, the galactic core is blocked by the sun during the winter months as the Earth rotates around it. This was one of my last Milky Way shots of the year, taken at an abandoned airstrip near Bon Echo Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada.

>**Camera settings: Nikon D7100, Sigma 18mm f/1.8 @ 18mm, f/1.8, 2000 iso, 15s exposure. 8 shots; two rows of 4. Stiched in Microsoft ICE"**
You can actually perceive the Milky Way with the naked eye, if the sky is dark enough.  If you're anywhere near a city's light dome, however, faint objects become difficult or impossible to see.

(Edit:  If you've never gone out in the middle of nowhere and looked at the night sky after giving your eyes 15 minutes to adjust to the dark, I recommend it.  You will be amazed at how different the night sky is.)
A lot of those pictures are also long exposures taking lots of light over long periods of time. The main thing is the as other has said is light pollution. If you are able to go out into the country on a night with a new moon. Then the sky lights up with something that looks like a translucent cloud. 
A lot of good advice so far :-) Just dropping in to add that it's possible to see it even if the conditions aren't all that great. I live in a city with  240,000 citizens or so. Luckily, at the city limits. Especially in the summer it's easier to spot, and on a clear night, I can see it from here. Very, very faint from my balcony, but just half a mile from here it's hard to miss. Not as brilliant as it is under truly dark skies, but it's still nice. 

TL;DR: Find a dark spot, and try - especially in the summer time.
...or we colonize the Earth while *pretending* it's Mars, and skip the whole interplanetary logistics issue.
bullshit... mars is a shit option to live on for humans... and planet earth is fine... the 'no hope' thing is for the human race.
2 billion? The ISS's cost is closer to 150 billion dollars. :D

But nevertheless, that looks awesome fun!
... can you get dizzy in space? I mean when you've been there for a while... wouldn't your inner ear just kinda go fuck it and stop working with near zero g?
[Source](https://youtu.be/8akgPBjkL-Y?t=13m57s)
But for real, when we gonna get zero gravity attractions at amusement parks?
Does spinning in ISS have the same effect as on earth? Will he get dizzy or feel woozy?
I just read an article about the planned trip to mars and how it's going to take around 7 months.  NASA mentioned they are looking for someone who can handle a long period of boring and then when they land become a highly active individual...  After losing lots of bone mass and muscle.  Its funny to see astronauts having fun in space but it seems like there's a huge mental aspect to space travel.

Does anyone know how they plan on keeping astronauts mentally entertained for the mars trip?  VR? Farming? Experiments?
Fun fact, the shuttle entered an unexpected spin, so they had to spin up one of the crew members the opposite way to save it. /s

I hope you like it
I hope by the time I'm old and decrepit there are nursing homes in space where I can float around and play video games in zero gravity. 
Command: "Damnit no answer for an hour! Do we have visual of what's going on?!?"

Command:"...we knew this day would come..."
ISS this is Houston, what are you doing?

Houston this is ISS, ummm science?
Can you fart in zero gravity? If so, will it propel you opposite the direction of the fart? Asking for a friend. 
And some say he's still spinning... i mean he's probably on the international space station so maybe technically they all are.
When I was younger, I loved the laughing scene of Mary Poppins. The kids laughed and floated up to the ceiling and ate lunch. I dreamed it could actually happen.
I guess with enough money or talent, one could really do that!
How amazing.

Hey /u/piponwa,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
I woudl rather see scientists have fun with $2 billion worth of toys than soldiers kill people with $2 trillion worth of toys.
Ah, yes. The simple childish joy of spinning in space. We've all been there, am I right, folks?
This is probably a dumb question but is there any friction as youre spinning around ? Or would you just tumble and spin endlessly or until you grabbed something?
I'm thinking hitting your head at "x" speed hurts just as much in zero G as it would on Earth. 

Edit: Hm...on second thought maybe not. Because you'd have more of a "recoil" action and therefore not all the energy is deposited upon impact? 
"We're whalers on the Moon, we carry a harpoon. But there ain't no whales so we tell tall tales and sing a whaling tune"
I don't know why anyone would want to go to Dubai. It's like an amusement park where you're not allowed to do anything 
In theory, could someone spin forever like this? I know in open space you could spin forever, but inside the ISS, pressurized with air/gasses, would it'd work the same?
My one wish would be to visit the ISS. Those astronauts lead a very surreal life.
That's the equivalent of a child playing with the box there expensive toy came in. 
I feel like I would have appreciated this far less without marijuana.
Do you get dizzy from spinning like that in space? Considering its micro gravity and your inner ear fluid would be affected differently. /r/askscience
At first I thought this was ISS and would say you needed to add two zeros to the 2 billion figure.  But found your source comment and as it is the space shuttle, you are only off by about 3 billion.  It's still cool...

i like to believe this is the sort of thing the astronauts spend most of their time doing

edit: a word
It would be horrible if you throw up there like that. Vomit everywhere. 
Can you still get dizzy in space? No gravity and all. I guess you don't experience G's right?
Would you even get dizzy doing that? I mean, there's no gravity, so would it still feel like you were spinning?
Do you get dizzy in space? Is the whole inner ear thing related to gravity?
Now for the ISS version of the chair spinning conservation of angular momentum!
You wouldn't get motion sickness from this, right, since there's no gravity?
Wait... so this is why we put astronauts through all those g-force tests? 

So when they get bored in space they wont puke from the down time activities? 

Still worth it.

If he closed his eyes, would he get dizzy like one would spinning in a circle like that on Earth, or would the lack of gravity prevent the disorientation?
Do you get dizzy with zero gravity?  I know dizziness has slot to do with inner ear fluid sloshing about. 
"uhh....houston.....uhhh.....y-yeah....i barfed in the space station"
God I wanna go. Just for a week? Just to see what it's like. Ahhhhh maybe one day! 
I love watching his center of gravity change. Zero gravity is a great way to see physics in action. 
This might be a dumb question but since there's no "upside down" in space, would this not make him dizzy? 
It's not like the money is flown into orbit, the money goes back into the economy... 
I when younger thought that being an astronaut would be thrilling, now I cant help but feel it must be boring. I mean after the first week it must get very dull up their. 
Just don't so dizzy that you vomit. Would be difficult to clean up I'd imagine.
Can someone explain something to me please?  In space do you get that same "spinning/dizzy" feeling you get if you would do that in earth?  
Now that I am am an adult, I realize there are no such things as adults.  We're all kids impersonating adults.
Much better investment than bailing out corrupt financial institutions. 
am i the only one that wants him to be sick just to see what it looks like in space 

Must be one of the happiest moments of his life. damn I wish I could be there xD
Does smashing your head into metal objects feel any different in zero gravity?
here's something i've always wondered. does your perspective change in zero G? because there's no gravity, there is no "up or down". so when you're "upside down" or floating around doing somersaults, does it feel any different? like...does the orientation of your body feel different? can you tell if you're "upside down"?
haha look at the spinning dude's lips, the whole time he's screaming "stop! stop! i'm gonna puke! i'm gonna puke!!"
I've always wondered if people in 0 gravity have a sense of what's up and down. I can't imagine a world not knowing which way is up and not being able to feel it
Man, just thinking about how far we've gotten... We actually made human beings elevate. To show this to a person 500 years ago, it'll fuck with their reality. It's like we activated a cheat code in life.

I bet I could get there faster than the front of the line for the new coaster at great adventure on a holiday weekend.
They're up there having the time of their lives, breathing clean renewable air and looking that happy, with the single best view of the planet.

... Yeah I'd say it's okay to be jealous.
I actually thought I was going to see a new park being built lolol
space men are tender but sometimes i fear thet they get sick all alone up there...

I would be so distracted in that thing. Buttons and levers everywhere!
Guys i kinda wanna become a astronaut now. How can I convince my parents?
The cool part:  
  
From his perspective he's staying still and the station is tumbling out of control around him because there is no gravity anchoring a "down".
"Ahaha Aha AHAHAH Aha Okay stop it. Ted stop. No Ted help, I want to stop! Im serious stop! Help me Ted!"
- him, probably
I think that's Rex walheim on the mid deck of the shuttle Atlantis. That's the most fun living room in any vehicle. 
What happens if someone farts in there? does everyone just have to live with the funk?
Wow that ride is [out of this world](http://www.memecenter.com/fun/1001485/these-space-puns-are-out-of-this-world)!
Can anybody give me a link to this gif? It won't work on mobile, and my computer bit the dust.
... can you get dizzy in space? I mean when you've been there for a while... wouldn't your inner ear just kinda go fuck it and stop working with near zero g?
2 billion dollar playgrounds is the inevitable conclusion of higher education and hard work.
When i watched this I looked around to see what would happen if he hit the walls of the of the ship. Could it really fuck something up ? 
That looks like a fun zero-g "amusement ride". Our tax dollars are being put to good use. 
If you attached a room to the ISS that was a long padded tube could an astronaut get  a workout in by leaping from wall to wall? maybe add rubber bands in too? No gravity but are your muscles working by pushing off the wall and such? 
How is only one of those 2 guys is free of gravity ? Aren't both supposed to be floating ?
Nice. Does that feel like the ISS is spinning around you? Would he even feel anything other than the cool visual effect?
That last second looks like he's about to crash into something bad
I'm pretty sure he banged his head hard against the wall after the video was cut.
This is not from the ISS, it is from one of the shuttles. 

The CEVIS was hard mounted mid deck on the shuttle. On the ISS it is mounted on a frame in the US-LAB.
Put [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0SwlMohRng) (Youtube) in the background while watching this, trust me.
It looks like he's saying at the end when he's spinning "stop me" lmao
BNL's If I had a million dollars need to be updated if getting there needs 2 bil
As much as I would LOVE to experience living in space, this kind of clip makes me feel like I would lose my fucking mind up there
This ride puts out a whopping 0Gs on turns and you must be this qualified to ride it!
How do you reckon this came about?
Like "hey Tim what do you reckon would happen if you held that?" 
"Let's find out"
Because there is no gravity, would you still get the same g-force/dizzy feeling in space?
Was anybody else worried he would accidentally flip a switch with his foot or unplug one of those lose wires in the background which keeps the ship in a stable orbit?
I see them flip like this all the time and im just waiting until they hit there head on something. 
i want to see someone using those clipless pedals weightless without a bike.
Astronaunts : we need funding so we can explore deep into space
                             5 minutes later......
what would happen if he held on while it span ridiculously fast? would it cause him damage or would he just spin at like 1000rpm casually? (assuming he was just floating in a vacuum)
You can obviously see the tether pulling on his pants. Open your eyes sheeple! 
Chug a few tins of beer, hit some of that space weed, do this spinny thing, puke everywhere... What's the cost of that cleanup?
Apparently the [1.3 Billion dollar theme park](https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-disney-world-worth-558bf73873ddd6a3) just an hours drive from the launch pad wasn't good enough for them...
Is there a maximum rotational speed in space? Could he potentially be spun round fast enough to be in physical danger? I really, really need to know this.
I dont deny them their fun, they are trapped at work 24/7 with the rest of the employees. I mean the general outroar when someone microwaves fish at work is hard to deal with, yet it happens every now and then.

I know that it was also not meant as waste, that it was meant in the sense that space is expensive.
[deleted]
I read Abusement instead. Probably wouldn't have been far off considering how many times they get hurt doing that.
If astronauts couldn't have fun, they would go crazy

It seems odd to me that space related headlines have cost figures

Unless you oppose the work, or are a fiscal inspector..cost doesn't matter (ok, maybe some are curious)
It's all fun and games until you accidentally flip the switch that jettison you out into space.*

*I watch too many sci-fi movies.
The gif ends right before his head smashes into incredibly expensive equipment 
the factory I work at is a multi-million dollar uncomfortable reading chair during my breaks.
It took me a while to understand that this is actually in space. Was the time well spent, or this ain't actually on a space station? 
I know it doesn't make any sense, but I'm just waiting for him to puke in a spiral. 
Expensive yes, but not 2 billion dollars. I can be an exercise device for less than that. Just pin me down into the floor and use my hands as pedals.
I read the title and nearly shit myself thinking that NASA was opening an amusement park in space, imagine my dissapointment when the gif loaded.
This can easily done in a zero gravity plane going by the time frame of the clip. 
[deleted]
If you dont pay for $2B amusement park, the astronauts will get severe depression and some of space missions will fail. Pay them much.
I'd really like to see him hit his head after the gif ends. They probably broke some expensive Equipment and need to hide it from the bossman. 
If he was in space he wouldn't have veered like that in the end of the clip 
I heard they have to eat 3D printed food, so let them have some fun...
Is this seriously what my tax dollars are going towards?? What the, ridiculous...
That's nothing compared with the trillions of dolars of yearly budget
[deleted]
So let me get this straight, women created the space station just so that men could mess around? Sounds about right!
here's an artistic represenation of that.

Andromeda is bigger.

Source: http://www.universetoday.com/22821/the-milky-way-and-andromeda/
1. About 3 degrees, or 6 times longer than the moon

2. As far as we know, it could be the same size or it could be twice the size, depending on source. It generally thought that it is bigger


The third closest galaxy is Sagittarius Dwarf, after Milky Way and Canis Major Dwarf.
There is, but frozen as ice, underground, and in deep craters at the poles.  
There is also gaseous water in traces in the thin "atmosphere" above Moon.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_water
The Soviet sample return mission, Luna 24, found .1% water in lunar soil close to the surface.
Theres a huge chance that theres at least one H2O molecule on the moon
Elon Musk is not a legend. He might become one if he gets people to Mars, but that does not make going to Mars any less far-fetched. 

We already have the technology to send people to Sun, every planet in the solar system, and to many many stars. Mars too. 

But what to heck we do there, live miserably short time and die.

Probes and other unmanned missions, telescopes etc are the way to go.
Sending some hard to maintain 75kg unit like human is not recommended. 

Robots, rovers and such thrive in this bussiness.
It is expected that there is a lot of Oxygen locked under the surface of Mars. Also large amounts of water in the form of ice sheets. All we need to do is get a magnetic field going, and get to work on creating a breathable atmosphere. Raise the temp a bit  Easy peasy.  We may need to bio engineer the human settlers a bit so they can survive there. If we cant modify the planet enough to suit us we can modify us to suit the planet. It just takes the will to get it done.

This has been known for quite some time hasn't it?  It used to (and may still be) known as the *Great Attractor*.
Very forward thinking of them to name it 'A wing' before the discovery of the 'B wing'.

There's a pretty damning analysis on /r/physics unrelated to this issue.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/5ewj86/so_nasas_em_drive_paper_is_officially_published/
Love the Weekly Space Hangout and anyone that frequents this sub should watch it every week.  This part with Paul M Sutter was interesting.  A good insight into the what scientist go through when presenting information to their peers.  
EDIT: Relevant part of video should begin at 41min, 22sec when you click on it. 

--------------------------------

Astrophysicist Paul M Sutter provides a good analysis of the most important graph from the NASA EM Paper, in yesterday's episode of the Weekly Space Hangout. 

Unfortunately, it would seem that the error rate has been vastly under-estimated in the paper. 

More problematic is that it could take several MILLIONS of dollars to do a proper experiment to eventually get to the bottom of this. 

Sutter also mentions another issue with the so called EM Drive: if these results are true, they would have wide ranging implications, and overturn a VAST swath of known physics and theories, so many in fact, that surely we would have noticed anomalies in many other physics experiments, in relation to this (which we have not). 

could the copper in the em drive be getting affected by the microwaves creating anomalous thrust? 
I completely disagree with Dr Sutter's view regarding the measurement error "underestimation".
The error estimate per measurement in the raw data is almost solely dependent on the measurement equipment, and if they claim the equipment can identify within a +/-5microNewton then I believe them, and they probably have the proof to back it up.

The fact that different measurements on the same power level are different by more than +/-5micronewtons makes perfect sense. These measurements were taken in different points in time, with a different magnetic field, for example. With the sun facing a different direction. With the frustum at different temperature.
His own "people in the room" simplification is actually the perfect example. if you measure 140+/-5 people at noon, measuring 50+/-5 in that very same room at 4PM does NOT mean your measurement is wrong, and it says nothing about your error estimates.

Truly a remarkable namesake and lineage with the Atlas line. Hundreds of billions of current year dollars have gone into the research and engineering that has established the Atlas booster as the reliable rocket. All launch providers today stand on the shoulders of those scientists, engineers, and businesspeople who paved the way for expendable rockets. Looking forward to seeing what America as a people can do for rockets in the future, whether the Atlas line is a part of that or not.
wow its like disney puts really good messages and themes into their movies or something
Unfortunately, this was bound to happen. Moana is a Disney story derived from Polynesian legend and there is the usual westernized view. Moana means "dark water" and was usually a boy's name.  That wasn't the name of the navigator either.  The Polynesians weren't sailing into an unknown, they were sailing with great confidence thousands of miles towards what they knew was more land to the east. One reason is they considered the shark their brothers and were keenly aware of shark migration routes. It is only recently that one shark migration route has been found from the coast of South America to the Tahiti area and the Tahitians knew it well. They also knew several bird migration paths, the golden plover traveling several thousand miles from Alaska to Hawaii every winter, for feeding and mating. The kahuna also knew about the migration paths of the whales. The kahuna knew these things over 2000 years ago. The kahuna also knew about 800 individual stars and the arcs they made in the night sky.  It sounds like the Disney version is a stab at the Hawaiians. They stopped migrating because they knew they had found the place they wanted to be. The Tahitians didn't, and went on to Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and probably further east, as DNA and archaeology is now starting to find. The Disney message is not the message of the legend.
Misleading video without any information we wouldn't already know.

All she really says is that "by the early 2030s we will have it sorted". So it's like Dr. Brand in Interstellar "I'll solve the equation by the time you get back".
Is this a philosophical question or a science related question? Typically "up" is the direction that is opposite gravity where there is significant gravitational forces present. Otherwise, "up" is a relative term. 

Now enough of being a smart Aleck, nothing's up except my ceiling and Alpha C. Sup with you?

Please read the rules for this sub and keep things space related. 
Unfortunately Milky Way season is now over. Although the Milky Way is actually visible year round, the galactic core is blocked by the sun during the winter months as the Earth rotates around it. This was one of my last Milky Way shots of the year, taken at an abandoned airstrip near Bon Echo Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada. 

Camera settings: Nikon D7100, Sigma 18mm f/1.8 @ 18mm, f/1.8, 2000 iso, 15s exposure. 8 shots; two rows of 4. Stiched in Microsoft ICE

I have more astrophotography on my instagram for those who are interested: [@thericeeater](https://www.instagram.com/thericeeater/)
Could someone explain to me how we are able to see our galaxy so clearly while simultaneously being inside of it? 
How do take perfect photos off the celestial night sky like that !? Amateur photographer here ! 
This is a serious question. Can you really see all of this with your eyes? I can't fathom it. I live in NYC, and I am even blown away looking at the stars I can see. 
Or put an other way ...

It's tme to look out into the rest universe again!

Does it look like this to the naked eye? That's my dream to see that
Beautiful picture. I hope to get a nice camera soon and get some good shots of this next season
The title makes it sound like you're going to Andromeda or something
Please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks it looks like a vagina. 
We live in the Milky Way. So every star you see in your life is in the Milky Way.
It towers proud and tall over the black brush... just like my penis.
Retired NASA Engineer/Manager here:
No.  Any attempt to Jettison the SRB's while still burning would have resulted in vehicle destruction.  Trying to Jettison the shuttle from the stack would have resulted in vehicle destruction.  The RTLS (Return to Launch site Abort) doesn't kick in till T Plus 2:31, with OPS 601 transferring to the main computing, replacing OPS 101, the launch profile.
This accident really highlighted one of the big fatal flaws in the shuttle program: the solid boosters.  Once they were lit, there were no realistic survivable abort methods for the duration of their burn.  

If there had been a big 'Abort' warning the moment they'd launched, they would not have been able to do anything to survive.  Separating from the launch stack would be almost impossible because doing so would mean they'd have to shut off the main engines (which were fueled from the stack) which would cause the whole thing to rotate because of asymmetric thrust, causing the whole stack to be torn apart by aerodynamic forces and structural stresses.  If they had jettisoned the SRBs during their burn, then the incredibly abrasive blast of the SRB exhaust would have ripped the fragile orbiter to pieces.  It goes on, they were doomed the moment those big unstoppable rockets were lit.

The designers investigated adding a thrust termination system (these blow the head off the SRB so they just burn without having directed thrust) to the SRBs according to Dennis Jensen's history of the shuttle development, but they discovered it would require strengthening the fuselage to survive the sudden jerk and that reinforcement would have added a few tons to the orbiter.  
I thought there was evidence that at least one of the crew was alive after the explosion and actually died when the capsule hit the ocean?
> If they had the video technology and high resolution capabilities that we have today, could they have recognized this was happening in real time?

Absolutely not, very Captain Hindsight logic there. And they didn't need high rez video, before the launch the SRB engineers knew that cold temperatures were causing o-ring burn through on the SRBs beause they could see it on boosters recovered after they were flown, NASA and MK management decided to go ahead anyway.

> If they had our high resolution video, and could notice that it was happening, could they have aborted the mission and returned the crew safely?

No, once you light those SRBs you're in for a ride until they burn out. There was no abort mode while the solids were burning.

> If they had noticed the smoke in the first seconds of launch, would they have continued the launch in order to prevent it from exploding on the launch pad?

See previous answer, once the SRBs are lit you're going, period.

> In general is there anything we have learned from this disaster?

Pressure to launch (aka Launch Fever) is very real and very dangerous. When the engineers say "this isn't safe" it is inexcusable for management to say "yeah... but we've gotten away with it before so it'll be fine".

>  do we now have better launch abort procedures?

Vertical stack rockets with capsules have launch escape rockets to blow the crew capsule clear of an exploding vehicle, unlike with the Shuttle where the Orbiter was an integral part of the entire ascent stage and couldn't separate while the SRBs were burning because of the forces involved.
getting into earth orbit, there is a list of "points of no return", and inertia as well as reaction time add a time distance to them were you can see a fatal catastrophy happen with no way to prevent its outcome.

often safety/backup measures or safety systems are not worth the added mass/cost, sometimes they are.

this results in a lot of options before points of no return, and a lot of lack of choice shortly after. you cross a threshold and deal with consequences.

higher resolution life video feed only makes post analysis easier, like the newer shuttle that starts from a plane and got that ripped apart in supersonic because the wings were set too steep.
I read an article a couple weeks ago that made two key points. 

There was no explosion, rather the shuttle burned up and the crew was likely unconscious but did not die until their impact with the water below. That being said the crew would not have been able to save themselves from their fate and would have only survived if an automatic aid was arraigned or built into the shuttle. 
The shuttle in many ways was a flawed system:
- asymmetrical thrust due to the SME's. That means you cannot just shut the SME's down in a phase of high accelleleration or the stack will break up. 

- SRB's on a manned flight. Once lit, they will burn till the end. Probably not possible to jettison them without exploding the main tank too.

- using a plane-like, huge, and relatively fragile orbiter for both crew transport and payload. Much smarter to use smaller rockets for the astronauts and heavy-lift vehicles for cargo. 

- due to the plane-like, double-decked layout, ejection seats weren't possible (not that they would have helped for the Challenger crew). Also impossible to build a launch escape system like Apollo or Soyuz used.

The Soviets had a very similar device to this years ago. Decades I think. It was called the 'Chibis' lower pressure body suit.
I find it funny I automatically added "Shipyards" when reading Utopia Planitia. Thank you Star Trek the Next Generation.
Could someone please explain the significance? Is this on Mars? Does it indicate water in the atmosphere? I'm very interested, but not very space-savvy.
[Looks like this is water ice:](http://www.exo.net/~pauld/Mars/4snowflakes/martiansnowflakes.html)

>The Viking2 lander awoke one morning to find that it was surrounded by a white landscape. The ice surrounding it had formed when the overnight temperature dropped to 140 K, (-200 °F) the temperature of carbon dioxide ice crystallization, but it didn't melt away at higher temperatures. Scientists assumed that the white frost contained water ice that formed on carbon dioxide ice seed crystals.


Isn't it crazy to think that some day, kids will have to start learning the countries and continents of other planets in school?
Holy shit I love this image! Never seen it before but it's definitely now one of my favourite mars rover images
Can anyone explain why there is a black box in the top right corner? Like is there something that NASA does not want us to see? :/
I'm afraid the flight mechanics aren't at all realistic, but it's still a cool game.  If you want realistic spaceflight your best bets are Kerbal Space Program or Orbiter (Orbiter is a more hardcore simulator).
...and if you want the Milky Way *and every other galaxy* for free **without the pesky spaceships**, get *SpaceEngine*.
I wish there was something like this for Android. Explore the universe, without the combat crap.
Ok, we've got a few people knocking this game. Let's be clear, Elite: Dangerous is a *futuristic simulation of travel within the entire Milky Way*. This means that there are superluminal velocities on top of lots of computer-controlled spacecraft functions that you can't manually override.


It is a pretty decent simulation, and this is coming from someone who has been playing hardcore flight sims for almost 30 years. The game does let you control your spacecraft manually (requiring a counter-input to stop rotation, for example); however, the flight computer is still engaged and will prevent you from exceeding the Vmax of your craft.


If you want a science-fiction simulator, with exploration, docking, commodity trading and exploration, that's set in a futuristic 3300's timeline, Elite: Dangerous is excellent. And it's multiplayer. And it's getting regular updates.


No, you can't construct a rocket on an Earth base and try to fly it to the moon and back.

Question. When a solar flare erupts, how fast is the flare traveling? Does this speed increase as the flare becomes solar wind?

I went to Gran Canaria last year for two weeks. Lovely island, loved every bit of it.
I subscribe to /r/vexillology as well, and I saw the thumbnail and at first I thought "wow, that is an amazing flag...", then I saw the subreddit and the fact it is a photo.

Also I'm pretty sure that is a sunrise over New Mars, ca 2250, post terraforming.
Taken March 2015. 85 mm lens, 60 seconds of exposure.
The author is using a straw man argument here. Musk never claimed that rocketry follows Moore's law. He's been pretty clear that for the most part SpaceX plans to use proven technology in more efficient way to make rockets reusable.

The main technological advances that the Mars spacecraft require are methane-powered engines and carbon composite tanks. They're engineering challenges rather than scientific problems, and both are already in physical prototype stage.
Rocketry didn't have 2 world wars to advance at lightning speed like aviation did. The author seems to forget that while the physics is well understood it still leave huge area of improvement everywhere. The physics of aviation didn't change , yet you can travel all around Europe for less than a 100 euro. Aviation didn't follow a Moore Law curve, just plain old economy of scale and huge amount of iteration of the same underlying technology. Where rocketry's Turbofan ? It is not there yet, we haven't even tried. WE are using the same plain old technology we used to go to the moon , Space X aim to change that. 
> the key takeaway is tickets to Mars would sell for the modicum price of $200,000 apiece by 2024.

This is not true, that's the eventual goal.  If your key takeaway is wildly wrong, maybe your analysis is built on a shaky foundation.
> Moore’s Law was born, with a pretty amazing S-curve with persistent exponential growth  

"Exponential" is by definition not an s-curve.  
Moore's law does follow an s-curve though: after decades exponential increase, growth of computing capacity has been decreasing since about 2004.   

Nothing ever goes exponentially forever except maybe the expansion of the universe.

The comparison with Moore's law is really weak, I don't understand why the author insists so much on it. I agree with the last part of the article though

>Vision without funding is hallucination. Mars is not a how problem, it is a why problem. I grow weary of pretty pictures of rockets. Musk has done the easy part of sketching the obvious destination. The hard part is why—why pay for it? And that has been on hold for decades. Musk’s rocket blueprints put us no closer today than we were half a century ago.

we may need a new cold war, or maybe a bunch of crazy billionaires for this...

Happy Friday everyone!  This wonderful shot was taken with a Canon 6D with a Sigma 24mm lens at 1.4.

It's a biased opinion of mine, but southern Oregon has the best stars.
Life is incredibly significant. The only thing more profound than discovering life would be discovering that we are alone.

Discovering new life means discovering new materials, new science, new understanding, and perhaps new technology.
OP, this looks as a very deep and wise sentence, but in fact it means nothing unless you can provide some examples of this "more significant".
Humans only have 5 senses and with radio telescopes and probes a few more tools of observation. A lot of what your talking about could be all around us and we would never know. Life may not be the point of the universe only another function of it. Our lives are so short compared to the universe we seem to be very temporary as individuals however, humans as a collective through out history may serve a purpose that we obviously don't understand. Sadly it might not be a requirement and we may very well never know.
I understand what you mean, much like a rock couldn't possibly understand a tree being alive, and a tree may have no concept of intelligent life, humans can only conceive things that make sense to them. A small animal is likely clueless to the use and existence of human aircraft, even if they see them daily they can't conceive their usage because it's outside of their understanding. It's definitely possible something like this pervades us throughout the universe, but as of now life is the most incredible thing we can grasp, the only other thing I can imagine rocking the boat as hard is answering why or how the universe exists, or what the universe is. 
Considering the EM drive just blew up the third law of Physics, what comes after Physics?  
I wait that day when I wake up normally, make my nice coffee, little strong as I like it. Pour a bit milk, roll a tobacco and step out to my balcony to light it up, and then realize that the light from the edge of the universe has finally reached earth, and our sky will look different after that for ever.
I thought we would have barely any clue what to most of these look like cause we don't know there atmosphere?
It continues to amaze me that scientists only confirmed the existence of exoplanets a little over two decades ago. We've come so far, and yet have so much more to learn.
Jupiter's got a whole host of siblings,
Saturn only but a few.
Some of the Neptune's siblings could fit in Uranus.
Venus's & Mercury's too.

The Earth, Terra, 13th Colony , Our Home
appears to be siblingless, singular, all alone.
Except for the viruses upon its skin, that do roam

It'd be much nicer if the shots were overlaid accurately giving an impression of layers and there wasn't crap like drop shadows on it. The background should be that of each shot, too. Good idea, terrible execution.
for some reasoin, looking at black holes or trying to fathom it literally makes me sick.

thats incredibly fascinating...weighing 17 billion suns? i thought i was big because im 6'1
> The velocity measurements were made by the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on the Gemini North 8-meter telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.  GMOS spectroscopically dissected the light from the galaxy’s center, revealing stars within 3,000 light-years of the core. Some of these stars are circling around the black hole and avoiding close encounters. However, stars moving on a straighter path away from the core suggest that they had ventured closer to the center and had been slung away, most likely by the twin black holes.      

I didn't know we could see individual stars (other than Super Novas)  in a galaxy 200 million light years away.   Color me impressed.  
"If ever the pressure system of these toilets were to malfunction, the ISS could always re-enter gravity within a few hours, as it is in orbit near the Earth."

What?
I always wondered why a portable urinal, with a small vacuum pump that had, basically, an airlock in the spacesuit wouldn't work.

Solid waste is a little hard, but the same principle would apply.  I would say a fitted plastic butt cover.  The vacuum pump would live on the back or shoulders.  

Calm down. We live in a time of fewer wars than we've had in quite some time. Smallest amount of poverty world wide, drastically reduced amount of death from violence and disease. With a bigger and bigger percentage of human population becoming well fed and educated.

Just because an ape died and your country made choices that scare you doesn't make it the end of the world.
Do you really want thousands of years of raids and enslavement the likes of which were normal during the Bronze Age?!
The movies you guys come up with, we won't ever ruin that, the shows are a huge hit back home! Since we are identical to you guys its like a huge new collection of entertainment. The planet we just took over is 1400.58 times bigger than  your planet, believe me it would cost to many resources if we took over yours. Some do want to since you guys did crucify our God; they want to make the planet peaceful again. (Jesus). We do read most of your religious text, but mostly the text during our Saviors time on the earth. Rambling on..
I like this! Too serious, everyone. There is no giant reset button. 
FOH, neither Delta IV Heavy nor Long March 4 has flown since the summer and NROL-37 didn't have a launch-abort system. I'm fairly certain this gif is from EFT-1 back in 2014. 
I don't know about he others, but the second one looks like Orion EFT-1 mission that was two years ago.

_^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/livven/wiki/gifv-bot) ^// ^[code](https://github.com/Livven/GifvBot)_
A star without fusion turns into a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole depending on its mass. Our sun would wind up as a white dwarf. They're surprisingly small, a white dwarf is only about the size of Earth, neutron stars are about 10km across and black holes can be even smaller. This is because their gravity is strong enough to compact themselves into exotic forms of matter not found on regular planets.
Pardon me, but this is a nonsensical question. The Sun is a balance between light pressure, P_rad, and gravitational contraction. This question would be the same as asking, "How tall is Freedom Tower without a structure?" or "How hot is fire if it didn't burn?" While it would *not* collapse to a white dwarf or neutron star (as some have said) I will entertain you.

Let's round the Sun's mass to 2x10^33 g. Now, since the Sun is ~80/10 H/He, we'll assume it is made of hydrogen. The Bohr radius of hydrogen is ~10^-13 cm. All of this will come in handy.

1 mol ~ 6x10^23 atoms, which with H means 1 gram is ~6x10^23 atoms. Now, the Sun is 2x10^33 grams, so the Sun contains ~2x10^33 grams * 6x10^23 atoms ~ 10^57 atoms. Now consider the atomic radius listed above, ~10^-13 cm. This, multiplied by the number of atoms, yields ~10^44 cm, or **10^30 AU**. 

Do you see why this is nonsensical?

I have assumed the radius is the Bohr radius, which, disregarding *everything* is a decent approximation. We have neglected some **very important** facts about the Sun:

1. The core is ~150 g/cm^3

2. The interior of the Sun is mostly (if not entirely) ionized, meaning the radius of the electron *does not apply*. So the forces in the Sun cannot be considered classically. 

To illustrate this, I'll attach a plot I made from a simulation run of a 15 solar mass star. While the mass is *much* larger, hopefully the point will be conveyed. This is what's knows as a T Rho profile. It shows the central temperature vs central density of a star. When in a log scale, we expect something like a linear relation (power law), which is (for the most part) what you see here.

http://imgur.com/a/sySK6

Now, since this is a log scale, consider what the extreme right end of the plot means. **When the star is ~10^10 g\/cm^3 , the central temp is ~10^10 K, or 10 BILLION DEGREES.** Compare this to the Sun, whose central temp is currently ~15 million K. However, *the Sun is thought to obey this power law*. 

This is all why you can't consider the Sun "without fire".
Because it doesn't work like that. less than 0,1% of the sun is comprised of various metals but for the rest it's all hydrogen and helium. I'm not sure where you got that from but it made me remember a heated argument with my grandmother, who was a muslim and how I tried to convince her that the sun wasn't a planet and wasn't solid. Her view of the world was extremely narrow and biased and she kept yelling at me that it was made of lava and rock and that I was deluded for thinking otherwise.

Your inability to do a simple google search made me remember that. 
The synchronized way they fall off is really remarkable. All that force and still such fine precision.. 
I can see the flight engineers peeking through their fingers at the telemetry, looking at that big, torquey wobble in the main booster when the auxiliaries let go.
Huh. I've been emulating a Soviet engineer for years in KSP and never realized. Now I know who to blame when I release a stage and everything blows up.

Edit: DAMMIT, KOROLEV!!!!
Korolev is a Great Engineer in Civ VI, he gives plus 1500 production towards any active space race production...go figure.

Not to be confused with the Kolarov Cross which is a low hard shot across the face of goal.
[Korolev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Korolev) was such a genius with such a horrible fate. He was sent to Gulag simply because of the accusation of a competitor that he was plotting to kill Stalin and had to do slave labour. He was tortured, almost died during this sentence and he suffered such blows to his health that he would eventually die from the aftermath.

He was basically the only reason the soviet space program worked and was ahead of the Americans. The USSR and its disgusting authoritarian regime simply did not deserve such a great mind.
Can someone explain why the tips of the boosters steam up/smoke?

Is it repeatedly breaking the sound barrier because it's spinning or something?
This is the coolest shit. They stay stable for far longer than I'd have anticipated. It seems almost three perfect rotations before a real variance. 
Is the display on this correct?  The view from the ground shows speeds ~50km/s, but the camera on the rocket shows ~1.82km/s
Man that name us close to the boxer Sergei Kovalev who coincidentally has a mean cross. 
Watch Space Race. Fantastic documentary on the space race and it delves a bit into Korolev's life
Fun thing is, this Soyuz was launched by Arianespace from French Guiana. They use it as a medium lifter. Besides the Vega for light payloads and the Ariane 5 for heavy payloads. 
Russia is an amazing country. They can't engineer a car worth a damn but somehow craft complex rocket assemblies. They're like the rain man of countries.
Amazing to see it from ground with such high resolution. Then, camera  changes, and we realize, it is already outside earth.
Anyone else noticed that in the bottom the right speed bar is bugged?
Just thinking about space exploration... It amazes me the understanding of physics and the world around them, that some people have naturally embedded in their brain... These guys are another species!  
Why are they falling up?  Was this rocket launched in Australia or something? 
Human beings are capable of such marvelously beautiful things... and yet still capable of such uglyliness.
None of this happens in British space programs [launches](https://youtu.be/pJdrlWR-yFM?t=7m17s)
Korolev cross is the future for our piston driven motors. A new way of compression.
52 km/s seems a little bit fast even for a rocket, but hey, I'm not a rocket scientist.
why does one shot of the same thing say speed 50 Km/s and the other 1,84 km/s?
This is the kind of thing that restores my faith in humanity. That people are still actively improving on space technology and furthering the goal of space exploration.
Why does it spin like that as opposed to say how the SRBs separate from the Space Shittle
I'd highly recommend Space Race on Netflix. It's dramatized but shows the Soviet and US space programs and highlights Korolev and Von Braun 
Is there a source video that shows the whole launch to space from the "rocket cam"?

I hope you like it
Was showing this to my gf and mentioned that "there is a much better camera angle from the rockets point of... Oh... And there it is."

Glad you showed that at the end. =)
There is a really good BBC program on Netflix about the space race with details about Korolev and the competition with the US and Von Braun.  Great binge watch.
damn people are really into this cross... this is like the 100th time i've seen this on frontpage
Whatever else you want to say about the Soviet Union, they built some beautiful rockets.
Can someone explain why it says it is traveling at 50 km/s only to later say 1.86 km/s?? I figure the first is a typo but that's a big typo...
Why does the speed on the bottom right change from 1.8 to about 50 km/s between clips?
Because of this post, i just made my depressed friend laugh. Thank you.
If there ever was such a thing as the space race, outside of the American psyche, then the Soviets won that.. hands down. Congrats on putting a man on the moon first... and being 2nd on literally e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g else. No hard feelings... right? 
You mean "the most prominent space engineer." Seriously, he kicked NASA's ass throughout the space race.
48 Km/s????

That's about a 100,000 miles per hour!

Clearly that's not the case, so what gives with that read-out?
I'll be goddamned if I don't get a hard-on every time I watch out-of-atmosphere vehicles work correctly. And the symmetry produced by their precisely-coordinated separation . . . Shivers. Ooooh.
We can "now" leave our planet, solar system and go explore the universe and its fucking breathtaking. Our ancestors would have never thought this possible in a million years.

If anyone wants to learn about korolev and the early space race Matthew brazinskys book red moon rising is great
Lived in a city dedicated to him, AMA i guess, right outside my house was a massive model probe
Where do the boosters go after separating from the rocket? Do they fall back to Earth or stay locked within Earth's gravity and is in constant free fall?
Are they reusable? Do they have a little parachute like the home use ones?
Camera pointed retrograde there looks like there is a dangling piece of wire on cameras left lower in the black part of spacecraft. Or is that a reflection of the booster falling away? 
Does anyone know how this works exactly? I'm assuming there is a pressurized air canister at the top released by a times valve, to give each rocket a moment away from the body? 
that is cool. This also made me realize i know nothing about the soviet's space program.
There is no way that thing is moving at 50km/s at 2:06. Earth's LEO orbital velocity is ~7.8km/s. 
The guy *was* the Soviet space program. And his story is super tragic.
It reminds me of when I would jump off of Yoshi on long jump in mario
Bonus points if someone can tell me why the top of the rocket looks bigger than the bottom in the first shot.  My brain thinks it's inverted in shots like these.
Bizzare! The name Korolev; Seperated by only the letter 'U' In Fiji there is a place called Korolevu, meaning either Big Rock or Big Village.

Is the fact that this machine was designed to visit "Big Rocks" to create "Big Villages" Coincidence? .......I think not!..............
And as all us Kerbalnauts know, you don't wanna mess up your booster ejection phases.. especially if they're mounted radially.
I am kind of surprised Kurt Magnus does not have a Wikipedia page in English yet
My question. The speed before the boosters are seperated is 50KM/S. But the altitude is not increasing as per the speed? Maybe it's on a certain angle? Moreover not is the distance travelled is changing according to the speed. Now when the camera changes/ boosters are dropped off the speed dramatically decreases to 1.8KM/S. Is that correct reading?
When you see the boosters eject what is happening to the tips of the boosters? Are they dumping any leftover fuel or waste by products or are those another set of boosters starting up to assist with coming back down? 
I wish my boosters would separate this well in KSP....  about a third of the time they end up crashing into each other or taking out my core stage.
Sad fact. Korolev barely died in the Gulag labour camp in 30s.
30 years later, when doctors tried to save his life, they couldn't properly provide him an intubation, because his jaws broken during interrogation in the Gulag.
Didnt koralev end up going up on a soyuz flight that got botched up on re-entry and they gave him a state funeral where his body basically looked like a pot roast in a casket?
I've always wondered this but how will they know where those rocket pieces will end up falling? 
Like what are the chances of them falling on top of a car or person?
So where would those four pieces end up landing? Does anybody calculate for that? It's probably a lot less dangerous than I think, I'm just curious. 
47km/s hahaha

almost 30miles/s covered.

104,000 mph is that right? Shiiitttttt
When the rocket is already horizontal and heading for water to splash down ;)

42km/s!!!?? Don't need to be a rocket scientist to call BS on that. 0.42km/s surely.  Something wrong with the display
[Sergey Kovolev's right cross seen from Earth.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L4RznJPLcFA) 
Are those boosters gonna be salvaged? like the ones from SpaceX, or they don't have the same architecture.
Stupid question, but where is the first camera view from? It looks like it's going "down" in the first angle, then up (perspective from the rocket) in the 2nd angle 
Space exploration at large owes Mr Korolev quite a bit, regardless of how little known he is from US History books. 
[deleted]
Humans can be great, hopefully in the future our race isn't dependent on greed.
Cue groundside recovery teams preparing to move in and blow those "carrots" up.

Yes, once they fall out of the sky, a Space Troops unit is dispatched to blow up, *then* scrap and haul them back to base. High-Test Peroxide is... unpredictable.
This might be a stupid question but how do they make sure these four boosters don't hit someone or an animal or a boat or a plane or a building?
What's to stop them from falling back down to earth and hitting a dog or something?
Just imagine if all 4 of those stage 1 rockets were reusable like the Falcon-9's, that would look so cool.
I just realized those each look like the Soviet Rocket torpedo.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VA-111_Shkval
I wonder if it's the same chasis.  If anyone has an info,please let us know.
Possible does not necessarily mean profitable, or even practical.  We're still a little ways off from those.  There's a reasonable chance I will see this in my lifetime, however.
Space mining will be costly, challenging and possible, but the biggest challenge might lie in a treaty over who owns the moon.
A Stealth Hubble Telescope called "Misty" was launched on February 28 1990 on STS-36. It was not pointed at space. Instead it was pointed at the Earth.     https://raptormanreports.com/2016/09/23/a-look-inside-the-secret-space-program/
This is why I like solid rocket launches better, intense exhaust plumes.
That's a pretty intense angle soon after launch. I wonder if that is indicative of Hubble being placed at the outer limits of the Shuttle's service ceiling.
If we could survive the new conditions on Mars then the planet  may also sustain parasites, viruses and bacteria that cause disease. However, the change in air and density may have some protective properties. 
Are least diseases that require other animals as vectors would be erradicated, such as dengue, yellow fever, zika, malaria, schistosomiasis, rabies, leptospirosis, lyme, west nile, etc.

Even in the unlikely event that say, someone brings a vase with dry mosquito eggs (some can survive for months) which hatches on arrival, the closed/controlled environment in the colonies would make it easy to prevent them to multiply.

Diseases carried and transmitted by humans would be anothers story; as you said, eventually someone would cary them to Mars, and as it already happens on earth, the consequences could be grim, because earthlings and martians could end up with resistance to different strains of a virus, not being exposed to its gradual mutations over time.


I have a feeling something similar to a yearly flu-shot would be setup, but it would be at a different rate and for a lot more diseases.  We aren't gonna drop off a ton of people there and then not come back for a long time.  Things are probably gonna be very active between planets once it gets going so I don't think things will change much.
The common cold exists because we keep passing it on. If we could all be isolated for a month on earth then - so I read - the cold would die off. But that not possible for practical reasons. 

But if nobody going to Mars had a cold, or those germs, then surely there would be no colds on Mars. 

EDIT: Bit drunk, just mostly guessing here. 
The rings of Saturn are so prominent, even Galileo could see them with (by today's standards) a very low-quality telescope. He described the planet as having "ears" in 1610. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn
Forget high power scopes, essentially any telescope will be able to make out Saturn's rings fairly clearly. My Orion Dobsonian mounted reflector telescope (about 3-400 bucks) can not only easily make out the rings of Saturn, but I can also make out the Cassini division with the higher powered eye pieces. Also keep in mind that there are times every once in a while (on the order of years) where the view of Saturn from Earth is such that the rings are viewed edge-on, and only in that case are they essentially invisible. Last time I checked, it looked like we had a good angle of viewing though.
Yes. You can see them directly with a fairly-weak telescope in real time. No long exposures or enhancement beyond magnification needed.
My telescope was cheaper than that and I saw the rings from my backyard in the burbs of SoCal. Also the 4 moons of Jupiter. 
[deleted]
That is indeed a valid approach. Lots of missions have been designed with this in mind (unfortunately none of them have actually been executed).

[This one is good example](https://marsbase.org/sites/default/media/images/Orion_docked_to_Mars_Transfer_Vehicle.jpg) The big tank in the back is pushing another fuel tank, an Orion and some crew modules out of Earth's gravity well. The whole thing would be assembled in Earth orbit. Of course you have to keep in mind that you're still limited by the amount of fuel and the efficiency of the engines you can bring. That is why a long string of modules pushed by a small "engine" will be unlikely.
[deleted]
While this is an obvious and valid approach, I see two problems with it. First one is that in order to make the whole system workable, you need a more advanced propulsion system. We're talking nuclear. Which means decades of work, and the political will doesn't last long enough for that. Then there is the fact that it's much easier, dV-wise, to land on Earth/Mars than to *first* settle into orbit and *then* land; at that point it would be the thruster (interplanetary propulsion bus) being slowed into orbit that acts as dead mass.
Because we have plenty of places on earth that are still unexplored and what would we take to Mars? A plaque saying we dumped our shit here first, better luck next time Russia. 
We have launched 9 space craft off the surface of the moon. The Lunar modules of Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 and Luna 16, 20, and 24.

Unless something is built on the moon it would need to be launched from earth, land on the moon, and take off again. Where is the advantage?
You have to get there first.  Why land there, then take off again?

it's a lot harder to get off the earth, which is still necessary.
I'm pretty sure it's because we'd have to land any fuel we'd need there first and that would have to be transported from earth, thus making it unnecessary.
A lot of people have given you really good explanations as to why we have not done it yet.

That being said, I think I do remember of that very reason being one of the arguments for establishing a Lunar Base. It would be a stopping point for longer-range missions, such as the proposed upcoming manned mission to Mars.
Yes, it is indeed already in the air.

For inter-planetary voyages, the Moon would be the best base at the fraction of costs.

This means to build spacecraft on the Moon and the Lunar orbit.  Idem for production of rocket fuel.

And we have the technology, indeed -> [NASA Scientist Claims Space Mining is Possible With Today’s Tech](https://futurism.com/report-claims-space-mining-is-possible-within-a-few-decades/)
I didn't know they had already done this either. It's a good idea though. You should be an astronaut. lol 😆
Paragraphs exist, and so does science. [Might want to bone up on it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)
Could you please link some evidence of this?  Some paragraphs would also be nice.
Neat concept, I'd not seen much about Lunex before beyond the spacecraft portion and did some more digging. I wonder how this would have worked in practice though, especially with the A variants. Looks pretty similar to proposals for S-IVB based launchers later on in Apollo, which ultimately failed to progress because of massive g overloading which would have ripped them apart, and mass overruns from structural reinforcement needed. Really the A series as a whole seems kinda unnecessary, they'd need to develop another SRB and a new variant of the A core with booster attach points, and its payload capacity was lower than the Titan IIIC that existed around that time period. And the larger SRB version also seems like a wasted development, its mass (for the 2720 variant) was only slightly higher than the UA1207 but with a lower ISP (and wider/less aerodynamic), and the 825 variant was less powerful than UA1205. The idea of a spaceplane for lunar missions is kinda cool, but on the launch vehicle side it looks like they could have saved a boatload of money on development and actually ended up with more capable launchers by using off-the-shelf parts that already existed/would exist within 2 or 3 years
Dang...that's been six months already?  I was watching when they first tried to inflate it.
Probably more than half of the next space station will be made of these modules. And if the moon base plan goes ahead probably too.

This looks nice but ive always disliked non-proportionate scales of the solar system. The beauty of space is the vast distances and the huge masses of planets that scatter that space

I did some detective work to try and track the original down. I ended up at a company called *Dynamic Diagrams* and their website which seems to be mostly derelict now. 

Read their oriniginal post at the *Internet Archive*: http://web.archive.org/web/20110210154153/http://dd.dynamicdiagrams.com/2011/01/orrery-movie

Does anyone know if the positions of the various celestial bodies are actually accurate?
If the image was actually to scale, it would [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/lp6wFTM.png). A pure black void, nothing else will be visible.

The orbit of Uranus is about 5.75 billion kilometers wide, while in the picture it's about 400 pixels. That's more than 14 million kilometers per pixel and that means that the Sun is less than 0.1 pixels wide and the size of Earth is less than 0.001 pixels.
It's not to scale, as you tell because all the planetary orbits are shown to be separated by similar distances, and are shown as being perfectly circular when they're actually elliptical.

I'm guessing that the orbital periods are roughly correct, since otherwise the picture is pretty useless.

Why is the Earth so much bigger than Venus? They're basically the same size last time I checked.
There's [this great app](http://www.emeraldsequoia.com/eo/) for iOS, which has a view very similar to the above.
It's amazing how many people don't realize how slow the outer planets revolve around the sun.

There's always going to be the have-cake/eat-cake trade-off with visualization and simulation. That is what is at the heart of this 'real'/'fake' perception problem that is going on, not being able to discern what are the differences between artistic and data visualization and simulation.  Scale and time variables are highly exaggerated but the visualization is only representing acquired data. It is interesting to know the Asteroid Belt is also revolving about the Sun. I always visualized them as being static.  Also, didn't realize the Pluto year was so fast. Earth is super exaggerated since this is depicting one Earth revolution around the Sun -- one Earth year reference.
Aw, yes. Not even the solar system could evade the mass rampant cocaine cartel in the 80's. 
You're oversimplifying a lot of things there, and have a basic misunderstanding of various fields of sciences there.

State of matter depends on the strength of intermolecular forces. Atoms and molecules have various forces that pull them closer to each other. Temperature just tells how fast they're going, how easily they overcome these little pulls between each other. When the forces are strong enough to hold the molecules and atoms in a shape, then that's a solid. When they're strong enough to hold them together, but not in a shape, that's a liquid. When they're just not strong enough to hold together, that's a gas.

Space doesn't have a temperature. When they say space has a certain temperature of X Kelvin, that means the temperature of an object will radiate heat until it hits X Kelvin, at which point background radiation will reach equilibrium with the object's own radiation, keeping it from falling any further.

You've got a misunderstanding of the whole oxygen on Earth thing. Oxygen is all over the place, it was there before life existed on Earth. All that bacteria did was evolve a process that breaks the oxygen off of other compounds. They can't simply eat one element and release another, that would be a nuclear process, and life only does chemical processes. Bacteria just liberated oxygen from water, CO2, and sulfur compounds, freeing it to be in the atmosphere.

No shit everything has hydrogen in it, hydrogen is just a proton and an electron. It's the simplest element there is, and composes most of our universe. It was the first element created after the Big Bang. Hydrogen is the very first element on the periodic table. The only reason anything *other* than hydrogen exists at all is because gravity clumped it up and fused it to make all those other elements.

>Not sure if theory would work, since without the ozone layer, the earth is traveling at the speed of super fucking fast. The atoms would have to of stuck to earth like glue not to be sucked out from space’s vacuum.

w-what even are you talking about? You have a fundamental misunderstanding of physics, chemistry, and meteorology here...

Vacuums don't suck anything. Pressure only pushes things away, and vacuum is the lack of that pushing. Earth's atmosphere is just an equilibrium between the pulling of gravity, and the pushing of gasses against themselves. The speed of earth has nothing to do with any of this, it's not like there's something outside of the earth to pull away the atmosphere or resist that movement. 

The ozone layer has nothing to do with a single thing you talked about. It's just a region in the atmosphere where O3 is more common than anywhere else, thanks to UV light letting it for more easily. It just blocks some UV light from hitting the planet's surface, that's all.
You might find this interesting. It's been doing the rounds here the last month or so, although I can't find a more scientific version.

I say this because, after being in the business for 20 years, I am very comfortable with my IDE and my intellisense, and all the wonders that modern programming affords me.

And this lady wrote something, without all the frills that we have now, that helped put men on the moon and not kill them in the process.

As much as I have advanced in my field over the 20 years, and how I expect to in the next 20 - I doubt I'll ever get to her level of competency and diligence.

A truly well deserved award.
She is my hero.

1700 PAGES of assembly code. That MUST work. No, really, only 3 billion people are watching your code do it's thing.

Oh and the ENTIRE weight of the pride of the USA on her shoulders cause imagine if stuff failed and Buzz, Neil and the 3rd guy died. And she was 31.



So she had the single most pressure on her shoulders of all programming tasks performed in the free world in the 20th century and she pulled it off.

And on top she is a badass, if you listen to interviews with her. I wish every little girl could have a poster of her on the wall, because this might just have been the most important single job undertaken by a woman in the 20th century.

Explanation: Get out your red/blue glasses and check out this stereo scene from Taurus-Littrow valley on the Moon! The color anaglyph features a detailed 3D view of Apollo 17's Lunar Rover in the foreground -- behind it lies the Lunar Module and distant lunar hills. Because the world was going to be able to watch the Lunar Module's ascent stage liftoff via the rover's TV camera, this parking place was also known as the VIP Site. In December of 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt spent about 75 hours on the Moon, while colleague Ronald Evans orbited overhead. The crew returned with 110 kilograms of rock and soil samples, more than from any of the other lunar landing sites. Cernan and Schmitt are still the last to walk (or drive) on the Moon.

You intend to start a discussion without bringing anything to the table yourself?

In what ways do you believe that Titan is better suited to colonization? Is it just  because it has nearly thr same atmospheric pressure as earth?
Colder, darker, more environmentally hostile... OP, what do you mean by "better suited"? The extreme sports potential is great ([propcycles](https://what-if.xkcd.com/30/) and awesome Krakenfjord kayaking) but other than that..?
Cons:

-Even lower gravity

-Saturnian radiation belts

-Slightly higher fuel costs

-Longer periods of time in deep space

-Less solar power

-Less geological data to work off of

-Longer communication time

Pros

-More significant atmosphere (pressure, aero-braking)

-Within Saturnian system

-Available hydrocarbons

-Similar air pressure

That's what I could think of, feel free to post more 

if we are gonna rank planets as best for colonization my vote is on venus  cloud cities 
I prefer Venus myself. Closer, air-brake to your heart's content, float in more favourable conditions at altitude, abundance of energy, easier acclimatisation in terms of gravity, etc.
Yes, I imagine there are many planets with more extreme features than earth. 
It kinda looks like it catches itself on fire towards the end.  Is that just fuel burnoff?

This landing is especially cool since it survived an inflight abort test. They did not espect the booster to survive because the blast from the abort system would blow the booster off course.

"If you land slow and gentle you waste a huge amount of fuel" - Elon musk.

Damn Kerbal Space Program looks more and more real every new update!  
An amazing technological achievement. 

Even so, seeing that burning column of fire holding the craft in space still feels...primitive in some way, like we are still playing with sticks and stones, and have yet to discover the real tools that will propel us into the future free of the concerns and limits of chemical combustion.
This looks like a way less efficient landing compared to the Falcon 9
How does it keep itself upright whilst landing? Looks like it should topple over at any second...
Wow! Those really cheesy special effects from sci-fi movies in the 1950s turn out to be completely accurate!

So for you control engineers, how hard of a control problem is this really?
This is how mankind is supposed to be. Find new ways, be willing to fail, and think outside the box. Glad to see some people still want to make leaps and bounds.
This long hovering looks horribly inefficient, the rocket spends so much fuel just to counteract gravity. I hope that they can make landings better in the future.

Compare that to SpaceX's landings of [Falcon 9's first stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYmQQn_ZSys) or even [Grasshopper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t15vP1PyoA), it looks completely different.
The next space race, she is here! Last one to Mars has to deal with Trump! 
The top looks like it was painted to appear as one of the ships in Space Invaders. That is awesome.
For a second i thought this was footage from the new Mass Effect Andromeda and was really dazzled as yo how Shepard is a part of jt
More or less a decade ago I was landing crazy taxis on launch pads on a game in my phone. Today we land rockets, tomorrow taxi's. 
For some reason, I thought this is another kerbal space program gyf until I look at the sub.
In the midst of a nasty political year at least I can still go read about engineers doing amazing things with rockets.
Im commander shepard and this is my favorite rocket landing on the internet .
I feel like we should be catching these rockets with giant nets. Is that unreasonable?
why not just allow the rocket to glide in for the landing like the shuttle does?
As much as I loved the first Blue Origin video (I've watched the teams reaction tens of times), I can't help but feel like this is less of an accomplishment now that the Falcon 9 is in the game.

Which is a shame since suborbital traffic is also of major importance, and making a landing like this is bizarrely awesome.
This has made that moon lander game i played as a kid a thing again. 
Someone needs to turn this into a remake of that old windows Lander game.
They are going to be landing 1/6 barrel kegs on the moon! Oh happy day!
We have reached the stage where when i first looked at that video, i thought, pretty good game graphics. 
Just going to pop in and drop some [source](https://youtu.be/bqUIX3Z4r3k?t=1h13m22s).
How does it handle the massive heat that must also be increasing the closer it gets to the ground? Astonishing.
Haven't we learned anything from the aliens yet?  Make it wide and saucer-shaped.  Much more stable.
-Permission to land like a dainty butterfly..

-Permission granted... Nice, that was nice.  :)
Is it just me or does it seem like a bad idea to land in such a sandy area, given how abrasive sand can be when it's being blown around like in the gif? 
Their controls scheme send so much less advanced than space x. This looks like a hobbyist in comparison with an industrial giant. 
This doesn't seem nearly as efficient as SpaceX's landings which use a lot more isolated thrust shortly before touchdown to kill the bulk of the descent velocity.  Not knowing how far along they are, are there plans to improve this given how precious the weight additional fuel is in terms of compromising payload capacity?
... Isn't this the most energy intensive way of landing possible?  This seems to only be really useful in precision landing. it seems significantly wasteful otherwise. You have to burn all that fuel just to slow down and bring the craft to a gradual stop,  and carry all that fuel to your final destination, again for the same purpose.
Looks like an early 90s arcade game robt face. Big eyes and smiling grin at the top. It's also the shape a virus.
I would think that incinerating the ground would make too soft a place to land. But what do I know?
Disappointed by the lack of Mass Effect jokes...

Seriously however, the fact that we have two companies now who have successfully demonstrated this technology is massively excited. Seeing Bezos pushing things, Musk being Musk, and hearing others jump into the space race is only going to help. Potentially exciting times ahead for humanity.
A whole new generation of scientists who grew up playing Mass Effect now get to name *every* *single* *thing* as "Shepard".
Here's a slightly sciencey question for you Reddit! Most of these tests land in sand. Are the boosters not enough to cause any vitrification?

Can someone tell me if the shuttle has a mechanism that will support itself if one of the legs lands in a hole?
This is cool!

I thought this was another Mass Effect post, but this is cool too.
Feels like the thing could tip over if it landed on something slightly elevated or uneven
It looks like a creepy flying clown if you look to the upperpart /r/pareidolia
Are there rockets on the top to keep it from falling over? How does it not tip over and crash?
I somehow always imaging there's almost no fuel left in that thing when it lands and it might totally run out and fall into its destruction at any moment, seconds before touchdown...
My girlfriends kids play Minecraft, and if I'm not mistaken, THIS is a creeper.  Amirite?
Why don't these boosters use some form of drag (like a parachute) to increase stability on the way down?
Can someone please doodle this with arms behind its head? r/reallifedoodles 
They should build a camera on a stand to look down at it as to avoid the dust spray
Aren't parachutes easier and cheaper than these booster landers? Or maybe a combination of both, to conserve fuel?
Much smarter people than me must have already considered this. What are the cons of such a system? 
All I can think of is attach 3 or 4 of these to something like a helicopter and you've got something like SciFi vertical liftoff planes!! Maybe in a couple of decades 
So cool...just like the sci-fi movies and TV shows I watched in the 1950's and 60's. Okay, so I never got a jet pack and the sidewalks don't propel me along like a conveyor belt. At least I lived to see rockets land on their tails.

How accurate are the simulations for spacecraft control? I wonder if deep convolutional networks can be a good fit for some of these problems... Or if anyone is looking at that.
Now the ISS crew can actually use their Amazon Prime accounts. Free two day shipping to Low earth orbit!
Would a pyramid shape not be much easier/safer to land? Not criticizing, just curious...
Nah bro, pretty sure this is footage from the original Thunderbirds series. 
This reminds me of a bacteriophage about to deliver its payload. Fractal universe up in here.
Why don't they shoot this at a non visible wavelength so we can actually see something other than dust?
When old space movies did this I always cringed at how unlrealistic it was for a vertical rocket to land like that way. Looks like they were right!

Not sure if that looks more like a penis or a virus, but either way, an impressive landing.

Reusable rockets are a great advance, but I am still waiting for SSTO.
Wow 40-50 year old technology. Impressive /s

This was literally done on another planet. Why is this impressive? 
[deleted]
elon musk: welcome to the club, oh wait, you're still not in the club yet.
It's kind of underwhelming compared to what falcon is able to do. New Shepard is basically the grasshopper tests just at a higher altitude. Falcon 9 is vastly more complex and faster. Still cool though. 
Oh god the Tesla fanboys have entered the thread and are trying to make everything that doesn't have the touch of Musk look like shit with their "facts" 
Ok.  I know I know.  Space travel and everything, but this doesn't impress me anymore.  I've seen this.  

Now do it on Mars without a Wile E. Coyote poof.
Being that many moon and Mars rovers have landed the same way I'm really surprised that this is anything new. 
I wish some of you would step out of the fanboi costume, it's really annoying.
How smooth is it though? For all we know the initial boost, or landing could give someone a concussion (if someone was able to be inside something carried by these)
Now try it without the almost invisible wire attached to the tip of the rocket. Not so easy now huh. 
I can hear flat earthers crying 'fake, conveniently dusty so we never see the actual landing.'
Seems like a lot of the challenge here is bringing it back down upright. Why is this? Couldn't they bring it down on its side then just stand it back up or have it right itself again when they want to re-use it?
If one of those landed on my planet I would expect an imminent invasion of perverts.
Why doesn't it just land on it's side? The problem is it always tips over. So why not juat have retractable Arms on the side that gently make it lean over or like a balloon that pops out to land on? It seems to make a lot more sense to do that than figure out a way to land in the hardest possible way with the most amount of things that could go wrong.
Isn't this the spaceship from that cartoon with the alien and the caveman/monkey? 2016, you did 1 thing right...
Sometimes I wonder if they're really making these to go to Mars, or if they're making them for easier re-entry when they kill us all with nukes.
I love how the footage doesn't cut suddenly when landing like Space X does. 
[deleted]
But isn't the earth flat?


Seriously though, interesting video, what channel is this from?
What's that bright white dot in the picture? Is Sol secretly a binary or something, or is that just background?
How the fuck do you write an entire article without [linking to the goddamn preprint?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03963) lazy fucks.

Great research though, I wonder what we're going to name this planet.
I encourage you all to read [this chapter from the Urantia Book](http://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-57-origin-urantia?term=monmatia#search-jump-result-0), read it with an open mind, it could be an interesting possibility about an ancient visitor planetary system that boosted and disrupted the origin of our solar system.
There must be some kind of typo. A tenth planet has been discovered! There's already a ninth planet.
Yep. Been noticing all of the earthquakes of late. It's coming. Doom and dread. 
I'm shocked that there is so much wasted space in that can.  I really thought that space and weight were really at a premium when shipping items up to the ISS.  SO MUCH PACKAGING!
I thought one of the rules for food in space is that it should be crumbless so they they don't mess with the sensitive equipment.
Forgot where I was and was expecting to see some kind of animal pop it's head out of the jar with how much the nuts were moving.  
I didn't read the caption and thought it was a can of almonds with water in it....

Didn't know I would enjoy seeing this so much until it happened. Thank you for bringing this gif into my life, OP.

So..are they always floating like that closed? (I get until it hits the cans inside where it moves at an excited rate, free falling). 
They seem like a poor choice to bring into space: one, probably no beer, two, the salt and dust that would emanate from that can't be good for the equipment on board.
[sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtaWWCXbtbY)

Looks like the can is already open! 
For some reason my brain screems: this will use too much cpu time. Especially when i think about how it never stops jumping around even if its closed and noone watches it.
When I see this I imagine the energy required to keep each nut suspended in space like that. It's weird to think that there is energy keeping them at the bottom of the can on earth not the other way round
Is it over half gone already?  Seems a awful lot of empty space in a can in space where you don't want to have wasted space. 

What an awkward fucking sentence. 
I'm just imagining  my little dog trying to hunt for nuts if I let them loose on the ISS

Space n weight wasted... Vac sealed bags Nasa? Gotta feel up that SpaceX resupply rockets with something I suppose...
Hi :-) Here are just some random ideas.

A lot of "space rocks" (comets, some asteroids) are just "dirty snowballs". You can make a model of one using actual dirt from the garden (or sand, or soil) and dry ice. You can get dry ice from many large stores for cooling goods, but also some companies send out boxes of pellets. Do wear gloves. Do not store it in fridge or freezer (it's colder than those and will turn everything inside into blocks of ice).

You could make a model of one, and a system to attach a mining bot / probe to it securely. Or a way to melt parts of it with a solar reflector instead of actual drilling, so the probe will not require lots of expensive solar cells or other power sources.

Or make the probe heat a certain area to alter the rock's course in order to bring it to a "mining facility". By heating one certain spot a "geyser" of frozen gas and water will erupt, giving the whole thing some propulsion. This way you would only need small drones to collect materials, and not multiple mining probes that have to find, mine and return all the stuff.


DIY Dry ice comets 

 - http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/teach/activity/create-a-comet-with-dry-ice/

 - https://www.noao.edu/education/crecipe.html

 - Wear safty gear (goggles, gloves...). On a fair, use less water and none of the "smelly" or sticky components (vinegar). Make sure others don't touch the dry ice.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Of course there are solid asteroids, and these will be most interesting for mining. Some of the above still applies (drill there or redirect them? How to anchor to it, how to drill?)

&nbsp;

You could also explore the possibilities how to determine what they are made of before flying to them, possibly making a unnecessary trip. You can do that remotely, to some extend by Spectroscopy ([1](http://www.permanent.com/asteroids-telescope-spectroscopy.html)[2](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/AsteroidsIII/pdf/3032.pdf)).

Here's a link on how to build a cheap CD spectrometer.

 - http://blog.pixelgiraffe.com/?p=461


All you need is some cardboard and a CD-R (works best). The resolution isn't great, but it's much cheaper than a optical grid.

From afar, you point a telescope at the asteroid, and see what portions of the sun's light are reflected. This way you can determine what it's surface is made of. Carbon, Ice, Iron... 

You can also estimate it's mass (size, distance, orbital period) and make guesses of what's inside (lots of mass -> metal?).

If you land a probe on the thing, you can use a laser or sun light to evaporate some samples, drawing better conclusions. If you want to make a simplified experiment, bring several metals and heat them -> Flame test [1](http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/3BA.html) [2](http://www.creative-chemistry.org.uk/activities/flametests.htm). If you can't find the materials, you can get "colorful birthday flame candles" on ebay or Aliexpress. [Link](http://www.ebay.com/itm/LOT-Pack-of-6pcs-Colored-Candles-Safe-Flame-Taper-Party-Birthday-Cake-Decoration-/222069387512?var=&hash=item33b45df0f8:m:mOxHCccYnGpvcH-BE7XDlnw)->Chinese seller->shipping times.

Sure, scientific instruments would probably include gas chromatography, but that would be difficult^[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXUUPwSVDf0) to demonstrate.

&nbsp;

Come up with own ideas :-) Read through some SciFi.

Inflatable space station modules are currently being tested with mixed results... Why not make an inflatable mining facility? Small enough to send a small probe, which unpacks at the asteroid belt, perhaps expanding into a large concentrating reflector, collecting metals... 

Or fly a small probe there, which uses some materials found in the asteroids to build parts for mining right there instead of bringing everything? Basically a 3D printer using asteroids, to build a larger mining facility, and perhaps also extract water -> hydrogen and oxygen -> to make fuel for the flight home?


> I'd love to focus on asteroid mining. Is there any possible experiment I could do that relates to this idea? Testing some form of mining?

google around. 


**Create a theory and hypothesis:**

Due to the extreme environment, distance, and limited technological ability to reach and return from an asteroid any mining equipment would have to endure extremes and be light weight to carry into space under current abilities.


 The most proficient way to mine an asteroid would be to transport lightweight and manageable cutting equipment  for removing large manageable chunks, to the asteroid, placing them in return pod designed for re-entry same as a return shuttle, and knocking them down into earths atmosphere where they can be retrieved from the ocean.This could be an unmanned venture.  


**Test it:**

Do some math and googling seeing who has worked on these ideas or similar that you have. Create scale models and attempt to simulate the environment. 


**Evaluate:**

View your results and fiddle with your theory and hypothesis if needed and then test again.






I have no idea about any of this mining stuff and I made up everything above but If I had to do a science project about asteroid mining I would start off like that. Hope I helped a little. 

A simple inexpensive one would be to go to a nearby mine or dry sand area, collect a sample of a given volume, then take it back to a beaker, heat it up, send it through a condenser and see how much water can be extracted, the energy required to produce a given volume of water. Even the driest parts of Earth will still have more water in the sand than the surface of any asteroid or the Moon. This experiment would probably only result in drops.
I do not remember how many times this was reposted but still every time it amazes me. 
The main ISS modules are designed to last 30 years. So 2028 appears to be the Realistic end date of this International peaceful project. I hope there is a successor, maybee more than one. . .
May someone photoshop earth in there, to scale. I cant seem to wrap my head around how large that really is. 
What causes some of the ejection to spiral back in towards the point of eruption?

Edit: Thanks for the explanations! I absolutely love physics. I'm glad my highest rated comment is about massive expanses of energy that could annihilate our entire planet in seconds.
if this is time lapse, how long would something like this take in real time? minutes? hours? days?
Aren't solar flares potentially dangerous/fatal if there is a large enough one directed towards earth? Can anyone elaborate on this and the likelihood of it happening? To me it reminds me a a brain aneurysm. It can suddenly happen at any moment and kill us, or am I wrong?

Edit: Thanks for the responses!
This is likely a picture from the [Solar Dynamics Observatory](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sdo/main/index.html) funded under the auspice of the NOAA and NASA "Living With a Star" Program.  
  
Pictures like these are not possible without the funding provided by the 2 billion dollar component of the 18 billion dollar NASA budget dedicated to earth and climate sciences (about 0.06% of the US budget in total) 
This is going to be my ass after our mexican-themed Thanksgiving this Thursday.
When the eruption happens, you see a curious artifact to the right of it, with several layers of color, in what I would describe as a "visual echo". Is this the result of image processing/capture, or is it actually happening in the Sun?
Why does it seem to get sucked back into where it came out instead of just falling back down to the surface like a projectile?

Edit: nvm that's the 2nd highest comment 
How has this been edited?  Has it been recolored?  Is this real time or scaled down from 10 hours of footage?  I love these videos but I never feel I can trust it to be correct
I find solar physics so damn creepy, look at how some of the ejected matter is apparently vacuumed back to the original point of eruption, as if it's going back in time; what does that?!
Haven't taken a science class in a while. What is happening in the sun that causes this? And is the moving surface of the sun just huge clusters of explosions like nuclear bombs?
If we weren't told this was the sun it could easily pass for a microscopic view of a cell 
Jesus...the majesty of those snaring flames near the "surface". The sun is so intense, it's beautifully intense.
It immediately made me think of a giant pimple being popped.  You can see the plasma not just flow, but squirt.  I imagine a sunspot afterwards, and a neighbor star telling Sol to stop picking at it.
The sun is predicting what will happen to me after thanksgiving dinner tommorrow
several hundred MILLION tons of hydrogen burned every single second of every single day 
Why do we have the impression that after the eruption part of  the gases are sucked back into the sun? 
I got a cold chill down my spin watching gravity pull the flame back into itself.
Why is that most of the blown up matter goes back to the source and does not just drops down evenly onto the surface of the star?
EDIT: Don't bother, all I had to do is scroll down. Thanks to /u/zyxzevn.
A question for the scientists - is the material "flowing back into" the ejection point doing so due to a pressure gradient equalisation caused by the sudden outflow? 

Or is something else going on?
Reminds me of the Balrog's whip from Peter Jackson's first LotR movie.
Space weather has been calm lately.  We're heading towards Solar Minimum.  NASA keep em coming. 
Damn, look at those magnetic field lines though, becoming visible when the charged particles barrage them. Notice the curvature, this plasma eruption must be almost a hundred earths wide! Imagine spitting a big loogie on an ant. That's what these plasma eruptions are to the earth.
The energy that would have had to go into that eruption is easily more power than anything humans have ever accomplished.  If we compared every nuke we ever manufactured it would be laughable at how miniscule that power is compared to this eruption.  Not only that, but the energy that is displayed here has the potential to not only wipe out our existence, but erase any and all evidence we ever existed.  The only things left are the rovers and probes we've sent out of orbit.  
Once you wrap your head around the scale of the thing... bloody terrifying.
I guess you could say this star had some gas.

Actually, at 0.999c it's 4.47 years:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=relativistic%20time%20dilation%20100%20years%20%20at%200.999c

Wolfram alpha is awesome for this kind of thing. 
That is definitely a bit off.  At .999*c for 1 week (in the ships reference frame), someone on earth would experience about 22 weeks, which is a far cry from the 100 years you are hearing.  You can compute this using the following equation from special relativity:

T = T0/sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2)  where T is the is the time experienced on earth, T0 is the time experienced in the ship, and v is the velocity of the ship (relative to earth).  If you google "time dilation", you can go into a bit more depth.

Related question:
Does time dilation affect LIGHT itself?
IOW, since light speed varies depending on location (space vs atmosphere, etc.), could light travelling unencumbered across the vast reaches of space dilate time while travelling so that the distance of a light year is actually shorter (or longer) than a simple speed / distance equation? Thus instead of a straight line gradient, the actual distance would be a curved function. In 1 sec it travels x miles, but in 60 seconds it travels less than (more than) 60x. In one hour, it travels less than (more than) 60(60x).
So far we have 100 years, 4.47 years, and 22 weeks.

Can some smart people give us the "real" answer?

I'm not aware of any master list, but heres some worth noting.

[This](http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=38583.msg1579564#msg1579564) lists a bunch of smallsat launchers in development, mostly by startups (a few established companies in there though)

Planetary Resources and Deep Space Industries are both startups working on asteroid mining, mainly for orbital fuel production (notably George Sowers has mentioned ULA is specifically looking at Planetary Resources to buy fuel from for ACES). IIRC both companies have test satellites already in orbit demonstrating various technologies

Bigelow Aerospace and Axiom Space are working on space station modules, both for use as ISS additions and later their own private stations. Bigelow seems the furthest along here, they've got BEAM already in testing on ISS and hardware in production for a B330 launch in ~2020

Spaceflight Inc does rideshare launches (a bunch of tiny satellites manifested on one launch), they've got a couple different payload carriers flying already on various rockets from other companies, and their SHERPA platform can carry like 90 satellites at once. 

NanoRacks does satellite deployments from ISS and its various logistics vehicles. They're also hoping to install a commercial airlock there in a few years, and they're contracting with Blue Origin to manage payload accommodations on their suborbital flights

Blue Origin is doing suborbital launches and hopes to fly a crew next year. They've got a reusable vertical landing rocket, they've built the worlds first tap-off cycle engine (currently used on New Shepherd, planned for use on OrbitalATKs new rocket and New Glenn, and proposed for use on Vulcan-ACES), they're close to having the first American oxygen-rich staged combustion engine done (which is the apparent engine choice for Vulcans first stage), and they plan to build a reusable 50-70 ish ton to LEO rocket by 2020. They're also in negotiations with NASA to re-enter the Commercial Crew program

XCOR Aerospace has been working on a reusable crewed suborbital spaceplane, though development seems to have stalled. Now they're focusing on engine development, hoping to sell engines to someone

Masten Space Systems has been developing vertical takeoff and landing rockets for a while. Right now they've got a contract with DARPA to develop a concept for the XS-1 launch vehicle, their design would have a reusable VTOL spaceplane as a first stage plus an expendable upper stage. They're also working with ULA to build a lunar lander/upper stage combination

Reaction Engines Limited is working on the SABER combined-cycle engine, that would start as an airbreathing jet engine and then transition to a rocket at high altitudes. They're hoping to use that design on Skylon (a single stage spaceplane) and hypersonic aircraft. They've also got some more conceptual work going on with space tugs and interplanetary manned missions, but thats all contingent on Skylon working.

An animated version with a 3D effect of my image (original post, image, and details about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/comments/5b3k9b/narrowband_the_flaming_star_nebula_and_ic410/)).

The 3D effect has been made by [Pierre Markuse](https://plus.google.com/+PierreMarkuse) using the [technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1WZGWSAEr8) explained by [Dylan O'Donell](https://plus.google.com/+DylanODonnell) for [The Astro Imaging Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiR5AmROq4YcXF8hCxxZQ-g).

It took me so long trying to make the optical illusion stop, until I zoomed in and realized it actually was moving... XD 
Sorry if I sound dumb here, but which one is which? I'm assuming the longer yellow one is the tadpole and the blue is the flaming star nebula, but honestly it seems like it could be either way.
It's cute but I'm wondering if anyone has actually created a real stop-motion astronomy image that has captured a 3D perspective before.
thank you for your creativity and sharing this.

this is very cool looking effect.  but a question:

reading deeper, seems the top part, IC 405 12,000 ly away, and the bottom part, IC 410 is 1500 ly away,  but the effect of the image makes them look like (to me) they (the two light foreground colored regions) are moving as one unit confined to a range of spacial volume about the size of the image we're looking at (ie: the top doesn't look 8x farther away in this effect (again, to me); the two main bright parts of the image look about equal distance away).

data from the description here
https://plus.google.com/+PierreMarkuse/posts/WFn5dd8YxyB?sfc=true

was the intent to give a viewer a good picture of the geometry we measure?  if so, maybe my perception of the effect is off, or my understanding of how to grok such incredibly large distances?


Anyone else see a slight outline of aang in the avatar state? Head down blue spot is the arrow 
Any estimates on the distances both from the nebula and the horizontal movement one would have to travel to achieve this visual effect? 
While this is mindblowingly beautiful - JUST SAY NO TO VERTICAL VIDEOS
Is there any video, app, or animation that shows the real distances between the stars that make each constellation?
I wonder if there's a way to calculate how far the camera 'moves' in this image. 1 ly? 100 ly?

Link to NASA press release: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2016-299
I saw the title and my first thought was that it was another overhyped theory. Very happy to see this is real news. 
From the NASA press release:

>It represents less than one percent of all known water ice on Mars

A deposit this large only makes up 1%? I honestly didnt know there was that much.

But what makes this discovery significant is its location, and accessibility.

>This deposit is probably more accessible than most water ice on Mars, because it is at a relatively low latitude and it lies in a flat, smooth area where landing a spacecraft would be easier than at some of the other areas with buried ice

So, for potential inhabitants of mars, this could be a very valuable resource.

I'd love to be a fly on the wall when Elon Musk found out about this.
Each day I see news like this fills me with hope that we can go to these places in my lifetime!
Am I the only one who thinks about the possibilities of finding cool microbes way before using it as drinking water even crosses my mind 
Remember the 90's when everyone was still arguing or clinging to that there's no water anywhere else in the universe? That was a funny time.

We're totally the only life in the universe, though.
I feel like the United States could be made slightly better if there were a New Mexico sized lake covering the surface of New Mexico. 
What about the possibility that the water is not really useable (or hard to be made useable):

* Harmful chemicals - we can't test for them with radar only
* Radioactive contamination

Are those just my pleb fears or could there be something to finding out that the water is not drinkable (and might need crazy refineries, impossible for the first settlers) on arrival.
I'm late to the party, but if anyone is interested in a tl;dr of the paper, it's in my blog post here :

http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/2016/1122-subsurface-water-ice-in-utopia-planitia-mars.html
As someone who doesn't follow space stuff much, what does this signify?
They say there are no stupid questions..

What exactly makes things a lake vs an ocean when it comes to other planets? Overall size or depth? Is it possible that under the frozen lakes there is warmer temperatures that would make it almost like slush or liquid water? I'd imagine that would increase likelihood of potential life?
Utopia Planitia... I can't be the only one here that thinks [this](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Utopia_Planitia_Fleet_Yards) is no coincidence. 
Why is "frozen" the only word not in all caps in the title? That's really bothering me.
Mars has lots of water.
We want to build cities on Mars. 
We want to terraform mars over the next 1000 years or so

How do we plan the cities on mars now so that Global Warming does not drowned them when it happens?
Is anyone concerned that Nestle will somehow get access to this resource?
So come on. Is it New Mexico, or Lake Superior. 

How is this compared to the size of Wales? Hmm?
Here's a soundtrack to accompany your short hop to desolation and loneliness:
[Ihsahn - Frozen Lakes on Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVHo1BU4Upo)
I just watched Europa Report yesterday, so I'm gonna go ahead and say we should stay away from that.
Has anyone considered the possibility that there might be shit buried in the ice. I mean isn't the theory that mars once had life. I mean bodies are still up on everest from the 1930's. It's a possibility right? 
I'm confused.  I thought we already mapped out the surface through satellites.  I think I've seen maps of Mars before.  How did we not know about a lake of this size and why didn't it show up on existing maps?

Edit: Ah, frozen with a thin layer of soil.  Should have read first...
It looks like all of the fracking technology we have been perfecting will come in handy on Mars.
Since when did New Mexico become the standard measure of extraterrestrial discoveries.   I am perplexed by the choice.  And excited by the find!
We need to get tf off this planet teraform/claim a stake for the people before corporations do it for us and format laws for us where we have no rights to the second home world
The title of this article is terribly misleading :( The deposit looks nothing like a lake. It's more like a giant pile of snow mixed with dust and blanketed in dirt. It doesn't look like a solid body of water, there were no lakes involved in its formation, and there's negligible evidence of there ever being liquid water in it.
How can I become an astronaut that goes to mars?

Mars is the most important thing in human history as of right now and I want to be apart of it.  
Maybe a stupid question, but is this a surface or underground reservoir? If it is on the surface, shouldn't scientist be able to detect the reflection of water/ice from a satellite 
Apparently from the time when I was a boy til now we've gone from "Well, there used to be water on Mars, maybe, but not anymore.  Asteroids or something... yeah, no water." to "Oh, loads of water on Mars. LOADS. Chock full of it. Can't move for the stuff."
How significant is this? Can someone smarter than me explain please. 
We live in the warm zone of our solar system therefore finding frozen areas is ok for an atmosphere like Mars. 
So the article states that water evaporates if exposed to the surface of the planet. What happens if a significant amount keeps getting evaporated? Where does it all go? If such a source was absorbed would that fundamentally change the climate of mars?
NASA's press release was much better than this article. Next time, please link directly to the original.
Says in the article that the planet's axis switched over time. How could this happen?
Mars get ready for some damn American style freedom coming your way
Martian Water, the next market boom!   
don't worry there is still water in space, let's keep contaminating the one we have here.
water on the surface and big ice lakes. there is absolutely some marketing material or life on mars to get this much attention from spacex and others.
Just put roads and cars there with people driving them and we can warm that planet In no time.
This is exciting news.

I wonder how difficult would it be to process that ice into drinking water.
So, I'm sure this is a stupid question, but how do we know it is H2O? How do we confirm the chemical make up? 
It's "face" reminded me of this: http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/amnesia/images/f/f8/2013-10-17_00002.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131017094246
Do not drink the water!! Not even a drop!! Water is patient water can wait.
Oh great water on mars, [What could go wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waters_of_Mars).
Would anyone who knows be able to add to this some detail about possible landing areas or settlement areas for NASA / SpaceX etc.? Is this the kind of place we would be settling 'arctic tundra' with the odd dust storm?
Does anyone remember when Mars has no water at all? It doesn't seem like a very long time ago and now they are finding lakes. People thought it had canals before that.
This is an honest question, my apologies if it sounds stupid:  How didn't we already know about this?  I assumed we had Mars more or less mapped out, something the size of New Mexico seems like it'd be hard to miss. 
I believe I remember hearing that a good deal of the water on mars contained toxic salts and other hazardous chemicals. Is this lake believed to be similarly toxic? 
Haven't read the article because bandwidth. Is it actual, thawable then purifiable then drinkable water? Or just trace amounts of it in frozen.. something else?
I know liquid on Mars is a dead duck pretty quick but if they breach the protective dirt layer is there a chance they could starting boiling the ice off?
There has to be life outside of earth. I like to think of the saying "any thing that can happen will happen". Give.how expansive the universe is, and the amount of time it will exist, life must be out there somewhere. We know life can happen because of earth. The planets are just too far away and universe is just too expensive to be able to contact any other forms of life as of now. But what can happen will happen, and I don't believe earth is an isolated event. 
I think I got cancer just reading the headline and the blurb. I seriously regretted that click :(
How is it nobody's cited Total Recall as having this exact thing as part of the plot? Crazy
They really should have used a different scale. A lot of Americans, let alone people in other countries, forget New Mexico exists, and probably have no idea of its size.
So...if the ice was formed by snowfall, where did the water in the atmosphere come from?  That's a lot of freaking moisture!
Someone needs to explain me why do we keep getting excited about finding water on mars when we're not allowed to touch it in fears of contaminating it? Or is it just wrt to future mars colonisation?
So it is 100% confirmed now? There IS water on mars? This is great! We could now sustain life on it, correct?

Every 2 days they find water and life on Mars. By now you can swim over there
Would I like to see more lunar landings? Certainly! 

But NOT at the cost of having to give up any Mars missions. 

--------------------------------

Also landing techniques on the moon have very little in common with landing on Mars. Gravity/atmosphere factors are completely different. 

Likewise, living off the Moon would also be very different than living off Mars due to a number of factors, including proximity to Earth, and also raw materials available. 

------------------------

As for the more general question: the Moon or Mars? Which should we choose? 

I've been debating that with myself for a couple of years now.

One of the key issues about the Moon, that many people don't think about, is the dust. For billions of years the moon's surface has been constantly and steadily struck with micro-meteor impacts (since there is no atmosphere to stop the tiniest of little meteors). These impacts have been ceaselessly continuously pulverizing the dust into finer and ever finer particles. 

There is no wind or weather on the moon to wash or sweep away the dust. 

This dust is so ultra-fine... that it caused lung problems for the Apollo astronauts even during their very short stays (and it also penetrated into most of the equipment). 

It is thought that longer stays on the Moon may result in lung cancer very readily... perhaps. I guess there's only one way to really find out... 

Mars' dust isn't anywhere near as problematic as lunar dust. But hopefully it will turn out to be easier than anticipated to deal with lunar dust, as I personally would also like to see permanent bases on the Moon as well as Mars. 

Hard vacuum and less gravity.  We won't prove or learn much we can't figure out in LEO and on earth reentry. 
Mars is a fuckin' arsehole. 

It's atmosphere is thick enough that you need to have heat shields for the compression but not thick enough to do a good job of slowing the craft down. 

It's the kids pool of the solar system.
Nop, we should do more landings on Earth, since the gravity and atmosphere of Mars is more similar to Earth than the moon.
They can recycle it, [and use it as fertilizer and a growing medium for space farming!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8LnewnMmTU)

They should talk to surfers.  They have been trying to figure out this problem for a long time.
Source? That looks like the parachute and heat shield, not the impact site. 

EDIT: Yeah, this is not the crash site. That is the parachute and heat shield.

So was it basically a semi-hard landing? I don't see much in the way of scatter, skid or debris,...
I would hate to see Stir Friday in a zero G environment. That would be terrifying.

Sorry to say this but reacting in this way just because the IMU gives you clearly bad data (at one point they say the altitude was indicated as negative) is a clear sign of severe QA problems. This screams lack of code reviews, mixed virtual/real system testing, unit testing and smells of organizational neglect of software development.

The computer should be programmed with a "nominal profile" of what to expect during EDL and just compare it to the reality, so if reality is "too off" just discard that data and start again.

Men From Earth - by Buzz Aldrin

It is the story of the space race starting from the end of WW2 to Apollo 11s return to Earth, all from Buzz's perspective. It was an absolutely fascinating read as the technical jargon of individual motor advancements/experimental vehicles were balanced by Buzz's accounts of working his way up from the Air Force, to Test Pilot, to Astronaut. There is also a great deal in the book about the Russian's side of the space race, which is really interesting to read Buzz's perspective on as there was a great deal of mutual respect. Men From Earth is definitely a more technical lesson as opposed to an emotional account/spiritual assessment of being on the moon, which might turn some readers away, but for your curiosities I think it would be a perfect book to read.

Oh, wait, I thought you said "a few months".
The Case for Mars by Robert Zubrin. It's both technical and passionate and covers in detail technology to build and use to get rockets with humans to mars and back, mini-factories to produce fuel, oxygen, metal, glass,... on mars, surviving, habitats, food... really a fascinating read from a passionate writer.
Thanks for the tip, will buy online for today!
Failure is not an option, by Gene Kranz (yes, the guy Ed Harris portrayed in Apollo 13)
I know its a movie now by I really enjoyed "The Martian" by Andy Weir. 
The movie was good but the book was better. Stranded on mars... You guys know the premise. 
First line, "I’m pretty much fucked. That’s my considered opinion. Fucked."
The thing about the ion thrusters is that you still have to carry some propellant. Since you can't generate more propellant it will eventually run out. The em drive is so crazy because it only uses electricity which can be generated by nuclear or solar(in a star system) means and theoretically will not run out.

Of course the ion thruster is currently better than the em drive as we have had ions for about 50 or so years now. The scientists were also working on the concept for around 50 or so years before they had a working prototype. The EM Drive has been out for about 2 years. Only time will tell if the theories turn out to be right or not.

Also, [relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1404/)
If my invention leads you to an invention 1000 times better.. how is mine useless?
You might want to look up what "useless" means. IIRC the EM Drive produces more thrust than solar sails, which are considered "useful".

I also wonder how/if the EM Drive will be improved upon.
If any deviation from conservation of momentum can be found, it is likely that this can be scaled up and improved once the mechanism is understood. Superconducting cavities would be an obvious approach, although it is unclear if a better Q-factor would increase thrust per power - maybe energy loss and thrust are directly connected.

The first rockets were not useful either, and the first computer RAM was produced bit by bit manually.
I don't think you understand well what the EM drive imply.
Even tho it is less efficient than the current technologies, it does not require any propellant.
And acceleration/time is the derivative of speed/time, meaning that for a constant acceleration (as small as it is) you get a power 2 speed/time function.

The problem with current means of propulsion is that once in space you can not indefinitievly accelerate, you run out of fuel, but with an EM drive you could for exemple use atomic energy/solar energy for propulsion, wich we currently can't (except for solar sails)!
For exemple if you were took a 538tons rocket (falcon 9 before take off), and you got it to it's release rate you'd get a speed of (1/2)(10^(-10)*4))(t^(2))+(release rate) m/s (with t = elapsed time in seconds).

Of course it would mean a lot of power, all we need is to devellop more efficient power sources.

PS : sorry if it does not sound clear but my english is not the best
Your example has a desire to provide 0.01 g of thrust.  In space, if you let the engine run constantly your acceleration requirements don't need to be anywhere near that high to get around.  You have lots more time in space for an engine that can generate constant thrust.

Imagine potential uses as lame as satellite orbit stabilization.  This drive would be great for that.  Imagine if we could deorbit every decommissioned satellite, even if they've run out of fuel.  Maybe we could use the drive to bleed off energy from reaction wheel systems, perhaps increasing their longevity.

There's no positive relationship between thrust and power into the system.

Holding out until there's some more data here.
Reactionless thrust. The potentional if you can scale it up is incredible.
In many posts you commented on the feasibility of solar sails (more proven less experimental). An EM drive and a solar sail has the same purpose, long distance travel. 

A solar sail is very frail and difficult to piece together as it is so terribly thin. It transfers a decent amount of power from the solar wind. This power simply decreases with distance. 

An EM drive may not produce much thrust, but when in space, without drag, it has long range consequences. Once out of the range of our sun's solar wind, an EM drive would continue to be able to accelerate.

If EM drives do turn out to be a working system, I doubt they would be used for anything closer than missions to the outer planets. 

TL:DR
EM drive: propulsion over distance
Solar sail: propulsion close to the sun

Hope that helps
It's much easier to give Mars a magnetic field than to get rid of 97% of Venus's atmosphere.
Venus is actually too close to be in the goldilocks zone of the sun even in the optimistic estimate. Mars by comparison is within the habitable zone even in the pessimistic estimate; it only doesn't have liquid water on its surface because it's atmospheric pressure is too low.


Venus doesn't have a magnetosphere. None whatsoever. That's part of the reason why Venus is the driest place in the solar system; all of the water in its crust, even water chemically bound to rocks, has been baked out by the heat and been vaporized into the atmosphere, where it floats up to the top and is blasted away by solar wind. This is why even though Venus may have had oceans in the past, it will never have them again, there simply isn't enough water. Venus actually has more sulfuric acid than water.


To make Venus anything close to habitable, we'd have two main problems to overcome. We'd need to thin the atmosphere and lower the temperature. The best way to do both would be to build a huge sunshade blocking 100% of the suns light, allowing the temperature to plummet fast enough that in a few hundred years the atmosphere would freeze out. Once the atmosphere was frozen we could build mass drivers and use them to fire the frozen carbon dioxide out on an escape velocity of Venus, where they'd sublimate around the sun and never be able to return to Venus. We'd separate out the nitrogen ice and stockpile it for later during this process. Eventually, we would have launched enough CO2 into space that we could allow light from the sun to reheat Venus and vaporize the ices into an atmosphere mainly composed of nitrogen, but which would still contain a toxic amount of CO2. Venus at this point would have an average temperature about the same as the Earth's, with shallow oceans of concentrated sulfuric acid and a nitrogen atmosphere about 3x as thick as the Earth's. Next we'd have to dig up millions of tons of fresh rocks from underground to react with the acid until it was mostly neutralized. Now, finally, we could seed the surface with photosynthetic bacteria able to break down the CO2 in the atmosphere into oxygen, and once enough oxygen built up, we could release plants and other forms of life. 


This terraformed Venus would always require a sunshade, and since it is almost certainly volcanically active we would need to deal with large scale eruptions quite often. This entire process would most likely take thousands and thousands of years at least, but it's the only way that doesn't involve either diverting thousands of asteroids or delivering trillions of tons of metallic calcium or other even more difficult options. 


The biggest problem with Venus is that we wouldn't be able to colonize it until, at the earliest, the 'frozen atmosphere' stage, which requires us to build a massive orbiting solar shade. Colonizing Mars, by comparison, could begin as Mars exists currently today. There's just no way that Mars colonization could take as long or be as difficult as Venus colonization. 
I saw something a while ago that suggested flying habits for Venus that would make use of gravity and the magnetosphere while avoiding the hazards of being below the cloud line.  It was just an idea though.
Venus could be a candidate for floating cities. The region of it's atmosphere with a pressure of 1 ATM has a temperature similar to earth.
Th Earth's temperature is rising by a few degrees, and the CO2 level is rising by a fraction of a percent. All the world's people seem to be helpless to alter those issues.

And yet, we talk about "teraforming" a planet, either creating or replacing an entire atmosphere. Just because somebody made up a word doesn't mean it's possible.
Ask [this chick](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iq2vQY1Jeaw/S9MinXOx2KI/AAAAAAAATR8/s4FCR5Szv_I/s1600/barrios.jpg). I'd assume she knows a thing or two.
Symbolism: space suits don't allow for identification of gender. It would be essentially two unisex people holding hands unless artistic liberties are taken in the statues.

Gender equality: the sex of the individual who takes the first steps is irrelevant to the accomplishment. Dismissing the years of schooling, hard work and training and  reducing that person to thier sex is counter productive. Their gender had absolutely nothing to do with it. It could also be said that he/she was just there as propaganda and didn't earn it. What difference does it make if a man or a woman is first? The message should be about the accomplishments, not gender.

Burden: is there really a burden of being the first? I highly doubt that an experience like that is so over burdening that there is a need for someone to experience it with them. 

Sharing the wealth: I also don't see this as a huge problem. All of them would be infamous to a degree. Take a band for example. Thier fans all know the front man, but not as many know the drummer.  Sure, there are some issues caused by that in some bands, but not so much that most bands are hindered. How would moral be affected by knowing one person is there as a publicity stunt? 

To be truly equal, gender shouldn't be factored into the decision of who is the first. If it's a man, it shouldn't be interpreted as a slight against women and conversely, a woman shouldn't be thought of as a slight against men or a gimmick. Even this discussion shouldn't be taking place, but even today, we like to reduce people to their reproductive organs and attribute the gravity of thier accomplishments to that. I can't stand that once something is done, it's news again if someone of the opposite gender does it. Gender is not a fucking handicap that is deserving of additional accolades. 
Also it should be a small spiralling water slide not an exit ramp. Or fireman's pole. 
No. One person representing humanity. A human. That's everything we should see when "we" get to Mars for the first time.
>Gender equality.

You know there are a whole host of folks that deem 'gender equality' means a lot more than two, right?  The moment you open a can or worms like this, you've end up catering to every nonsensical notion being touted.

A *person* will land on Mars and be the first.  I honestly don't care if it a man or a woman so long as they get there and return, safely to the Earth.
Yeah but imagine the logistic pain in the ass of trying to descend a ladder in a environmental suit hand in hand
How about we don't pollute another planet by spending all of our time thinking about who has which genitals and how that makes them feel? 

There are better things we could be doing.


Who gives a fuck...man made it to mars....I'm pretty sure that's all people would care about.....only people like you think this way
Nice thoughts but have you considered how upset the HBTQ-community will be? In these days of political correctness we need six people touching the ground in the exact same millisecond to please everyone. 

Wait: I forgot the blacks, Hispanics, inuits, aboriginals, vegetarians, lefthanded, far sighted, amputees...

This will still not please everyone. 
People should stop giving so much importance about gender, the first person on Mars being male or female is completely irrelevant compared to the actual achievement of reaching another planet. How you can even think about this thing is just impossible to understand  for me
Yeah? Why? It's an planetary landing not a wedding. Maybe they should have a flower girl too? 
Ok, but first they have to spend several decades and billions of dollars to figure out which race / sex combination is going to make the most people happy / least people angry.

Then you have to include all races, religions, and views of sci-fi TV.

The fact a human is stepping foot on another planet should be bigger than whoever actually made that giant leap, for mankind.
I've seen that movie before. "Docking", "insertion", and "injection" all meant something way different than what I was expecting from a space mission.

I don't think NASA really had a tight control on the content of that documentary.
the idea that women are just as adventurous and just as interested in jobs that carry high risks is a fiction peddled by the left.  while this may symbolize that fiction, and you could certainly find a woman to do it, it would only be useful to further advance the lie that women are the same as men.  they are not.  it's typically men who do dangerous things because that's our evolutionary and social role.  if you want to live in this world of illusion regarding sex and gender you can, but don't pretend it reflects reality.
> but it shouldn't be "he or she." It should be he and she.

Triggered, assuming the astronauts gender like that. Why not a nonbinary genderfluid autigender while we are at it.
There shouldn't be a first white man on the moon, they should include every race and should all join hands in a huge circle while taking the first steps. To represent how humanities destiny is to be integrated beyond earth.

No.
Somehow, this comment thread is full of hate. I think this is a lovely idea. Logistically, it might not be feasible to pull off, of course (someone made a good point about two people climbing down a ladder), but your points are spot on.
We're gonna see whatever anyone who's using the mouse cursor will show us whether it's a face on a rock or a machine part or what have you. I watched this on mute and I found so many more things there what because of the shadows and the myriad of natural shapes it's just a juggernaut of ricks is what that is. 
It's our brain try to find things that could be predators. No anomalies here. 
I really hope there will be more mission and even "suicide probe" to lear more about the sun. After all if we want to make fusion reactor here we should learn about the biggest one in our solar system!
I know it'll probably never be realised nor would it be a better idea but the Nautilus X would be way cooler than SpaceX' ITS.
it reminds me of this documentary (in french)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOFJhex2lr0
I like the idea for Mars coming last. Ofcourse I'd love to see humans go to any other planet. I just don't find Mars nearly as interesting as some other planets, expecially Venus.  
I'm just going to leave this here...

"Mars in 39 days:

In order to conduct a manned trip to "Mars in just 39 days",[37][38][39] the VASIMR would require an electrical power level delivered only by nuclear propulsion (specifically the nuclear electric type) by way of nuclear power in space.[40] This kind of nuclear fission reactor might use a traditional Rankine/Brayton/Stirling conversion engine such as that used by the SAFE-400 reactor (Brayton cycle) or the DUFF Kilopower[41] reactor (Stirling cycle) to convert heat to electricity. However, the vehicle might be better served with non-moving parts and non-steam based power conversion using a thermocell technology of the thermoelectric (including graphene-based thermal power conversion[42][43][44]), pyroelectric, thermophotovoltaic, thermionic magnetohydrodynamic type. Thermoelectric materials are also option for converting heat energy (being both black-body radiation and the kinetic thermal vibration of molecules and other particles) to electric current energy (electrons flowing through a circuit). Avoiding the need for "football-field sized radiators" (Zubrin quote) for a "200,000 kilowatt (200 megawatt) reactor with a power-to-mass density of 1,000 watts per kilogram" (Díaz quote)[45][46] this reactor would require efficient waste heat capturing technology.[47] For comparison, a Seawolf-class nuclear-powered fast attack submarine uses a 34 megawatt reactor, and the Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station uses a 690 megawatt reactor." -[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket)
Wait, why do they list Mercury as a source of Helium-3 but not the Moon, which is right at our doorstep?
"Summit Olympus Mons." Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it'd be particularly hard (aside from the getting to mars bit). It's not very steep, so it would be a fairly easy, if very long, walk. 
meh. none of that interests me. humans to the asteroids and the moon and new missions to the gas giants are where its at!

Why? It hasn't looked like that in the last 40 years, and it should have. What you makes you think that all of a sudden, especially considering the anti-science crowd that's being emplaced around the carny, Planet Earth is going to "fire all of our guns at once, and, explode into space"?

There are a lot of misconceptions about black holes - particularly given its not something we get to study (up close).

1) For a start, they are not holes, no rip in the space/time continuum, no fast travel to distant stars, sorry, you're thinking of wormholes - different thing.

So technically you can't "go inside", any more than you can go inside a planet.

2) They are not black, they appear black because the escaping light (yes light escapes from black holes) is red-shifted (the waves are literally stretched) beyond the visible spectrum.

As to what happens when you go near them - you get stretched.

The bit of you closest get pulled towards it so much more than the bit of you furthest away that you become like string.
A black hole isn't actually a hole, but rather an extremely dense celestial body. The sheer amount of force pulling you in would make for some interesting space-time effects, but more immediately you'd simply die an instant, messy death by being stretched and ripped apart by gravity.

Once "inside" the black hole your body (along with your spaceship, presumably) would be compressed into a wide, but very flat mass on the surface of the body and thus become part of it.
Your body would undergo spaghettification or the "noodle effect". This is where the body is stretched so far vertically because of the pull that it appears skinny and stretched out hence the name spaghetti. Surely someone can explain better then me, all I know is what would happen to a person.
I love watching all the different Space videos available.  But why do the presenters always talk about Black Holes as if they were discovered last month and the audience has hardly heard of them.  Why do they call Black Holes 'strange' when we have been hearing about them for at least thirty years.  
What kind of IMU was it? Did they do any robustness testing at all?
It's hard to grasp the fact that there's a metal thing floating so far away from us freely in space, and most probobly will out-live the life on earth
That's the measurement I use to tell people how far away I am when I'm late. "hey! I'm  8.505390e-13ly away" by the time they figure it out I will probably still be late.


Are we ignoring the fact Voyager2 is the furthest object on Twitter.
Its data plan has to drain NASA budget seriously
One day, mankind will be able to travel fast enough through space to eventually retrieve Voyager 2.
That's about 0.0017 light years away.  It would take the Enterprise D about 18 seconds at warp 9.6 (top speed) to reach Voyager 2.  For comparison, the USS Voyager would take about 4 seconds at warp 9.975 to reach its namesake.
Can anyone explain that timestamp to me? Obviously, I get the 2016:327 part but the rest? Whats with the 2L?
15 hours away, and it's at the edge of our solar system.
If we're ever going to have manned exploration, light speed is too slow.  
I was in 7th grade when it left earth, I remember thinking about what my life might be like as the markers passed...

passing Jupiter "wow I will be a freshman" (I was) 

passing Saturn "I'll be a junior and have a girlfriend (nope)

passing Uranus (insert joke here)

passing Neptune "I will be a man and probably be working (I was, also married)

Leaving the solar system "I'll probably be dead" (I'm not, also divorced)

Reaches Proxima Centauri "my species will be extinct" (please add note in 80k years)

Really makes you think about how tiny we are in this universe.  The furthest object is less than 16 hours away at the speed of light.  We as a species have so much to learn and so much to see.  I am excited for the future.
Always thought this was a great way to put the voyagers distance in perspective, "If the Milky Way was the size of a quarter, the voyagers would still be inside the first atom" 
I saw the twitter handle and immediately thought Not Safe For Work.

Not Safe For Vacuums?

Edit: Space is a vacuum. I'm dumb.
For a minute I thought that Voyager2 was literally sending tweets using it's transmitter, until I thought, "wow that seems like a waste of energy..."

I'm dumb.
"If through human, non human or natural processes, humanity does not survive, our space probes like Voyager-1 will stand as a testament for millions of years making one very profound statement:

For at least one moment in our short history we over came astounding obstacles and almost insurmountable odds, and projected our inherent curiosity and need for discovery in to the universe."
Wow they were so forward thinking to install the twitter app on it in the 70s.
Anyone know how long it'll take to be an entire light year from Earth?

Edit: So around 20k years. Thanks for answering the question. You /r/space guys are nice!
Voyager 2 launched in 1977. Only took 40 Earth-years to get there.  Not much longer to get to Alpha Centauri! Yeah,  star travel RSN (Real Soon Now). /satire

Some scientists believe that the events of 2016 have actually further accelerated the spacecraft away from the solar system
Either light is really slow or space is really vast. My brain wants to default to believing light is really slow, because it just cannot fathom the distances involved.

We learn about our solar system from an early age, but we are shown not-to-scale models which build this map in our minds of a 'local backyard' of planets. The reality is the distance between them is staggering.

The only way I can really attempt to make sense of it is by comparing to distance on Earth. It takes me 10 minutes to travel to work by bike. That's 3 miles.

Voyager is out past Pluto. Pluto at its closest is 2.66 billion miles (4.28 billion km) from Earth. For me to travel that distance, I'd be cycling non-stop for the next 16,858 years.
Pretty amazing it has wifi all the way out there. Very impressive stuff when you think about it!
How much does this vary based on the current position of the planet? Surely a graph of its distance away from the planet over time has a sinusoidal wave to it?
Don't know why but find it strangely comforting thinking about this guy all the way out there
[State of the internet](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/18sxo4gzn434wjpg.jpg) when this was launched.
NASA can talk to a probe 15 light hours away and I can barely get wifi signal in my bedroom.
I don't know what scientific purpose it'd have. But I'd love for someone to build a spacecraft with a 100+ year lifespan (huge RTG or maybe a reactor), a huge antenna & powerful transmitter, and send it somewhere on a really fast course. Like, direction is less important than speed - so if we can get some really good gravity assists towards a less interesting direction, that's fine. I don't know what the upper limit is due to the rocket paradox or whatever it's called, but I'd love to see what would happen if we got a craft to double the speed or more of voyager. I'm sure we'd find our really interesting things about deep interstellar space, and even if not it'd be very cool to listen to a spacecraft 150 years old in the middle of nowhere. 
Probably complaining about how young space probes these days are lazy.
I know it'll be some 300k years from now but I'm curious when Voyager 2 eventually meets up with another star will it wake up again? Or is it doomed to be silent forever when it loses power from being too far away from the Sun.
Why have we stopped sending those ?

We should be sending those in all directions, more modern versions every few years, with better optics, radios and try laser communication.

Why have we stopped dreaming ?
So this thing is miles away from being the furthest it has ever been from the planet and still can communicate with Houston. I enter the elevator and the phone goes dead. Srsly..
Won't be long now, juuuuust a little bit farther and its camera should be able to get OP's mom completely in frame. 
No, it _was_ 15 hrs 42 mins 37 seconds of light travel away from earth _15 hrs 42 mins 37 seconds_ before this was tweeted.
But that distance.  So far.  So many miles.  So many pee breaks in not great areas.

first contact little green men find voyager 2 bring it back and say keep your fucking trash out of our solar system
Maybe we need a Voyager 3 that supports 8K and HDMI. Imagine the possibilities...
Oh my god. Wasnt this sent out in the 70's? Holy shit. Its moving so slow 
Yeah yeah yeah, but is that from when you sent the message or when we received it?
What I often wonder is will we ever build a probe or spacecraft with propulsion that will be able to catch up with it in a reasonable amount of time.
I have and always will love thinking about space. To think about just how tiny we are compared to the universe. I'm 21 and I know in my lifetime we will never physically explore the cosmos. But it is amazing to think one day man will be somewhere else or even to even think about meeting another human like species out there. Which will forever change the way we look at space. Obviously we know somewhere out there, there is life like ours but to finally have 100% confirmation. It's to bad that we are limited by our technology and by our evolution. We don't live long enough to send someone to deep space. And our technology is not advanced enough to send someone to deep space in the short time we have. 
Nearly 40 years to cover a distance that light covers in less than 16 hours. And even light itself is pathetically slow, taking 100,000 years just to cross our own galaxy. 

Space-faring technology has such a long way to go :(

Live odometer of where the Voyagers are: http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/
Nice, so if we discovered light speed travel we could go and get it and be back home in less than a weekend. 
So is it correct to say if Voyager were to travel at the speed of light back to earth it would take 15h 42 min and 37 s?
~~Almost twice as far from us as we are from the sun. Keep going Voyager!~~

EDIT: Dear lord I read 15 hours as 15 minutes.

What are Brain doing?
It might be a really dumb question since my brain has taken a beating over the past few days from work, but how did they get this thing to tweet? 
Or you were 15 hours 42 minutes and 37 seconds ago, plus the time it takes your tweet to be processed.
if we built one with todays technology, it would get to were the voyager 2 is, in half the time. and then we build another in 20 years and itll be there in just 2 years. and then that one would fall off the edge of space. because space is flat.
Light's going to want to look at some AirBnBs on the way. 18 hours is too much travel for one day.
I also find it amazing (assuming this tweet wasn't pre-programmed to be sent out at a calculated time) that probe can send a signal powerful enough to travel for 16 hours
Damn.... Space is big and Light travels fast.  wow. I mean, I knew that... but this helped me put that in perspective a bit. The vastness of space was always so abstract to me. 
If i would travel with the speed of light for 15 min and then back to of for 15 min. How much time would have passed on earth since i left
Being someone who is a noob about anything space related, what kind of info is the Voyager 2 retrieving and how are we able to get that info from so far away if we are getting it at all?
And it gets a better internet connection in space than I do in Australia!
how does a robot like this have internet? satellite internets i guess?

Annnnnd for perspective, the NEAREST star, Alpha Centauri, is 4.367 light YEARS away. 

We're gonna need a faster ship...
7 Seasons for 3 of those 15 hours, then just 45 minutes to rekindle its love of coffee and take a 2 minute trip through a wormhole..
Ahh so the atomic laser I shot at it has some time to travel yet.... Mawahhahaha
How many miles away is that, people who are smarter than me?  I have the dumb disease right now.
Does that mean it sent out that tweet 15hrs and 42 minutes before it got to that distance from earth? 
Distance is  299792458 m/s x (15.761667 hours x 60 minutes per hour x 60 seconds per minute), if I'm not mistaken...

So the distance is 1.7010824e+13 meters.

Or, 17,010,824,011.6 kilometers

Or, 10,570,035,997.02736 miles

That's quite a distance. 

And to think, Voyager 2 was launched over 39 years ago. It's older than I am, and over 10.57 billion miles away. To think that if it were travelling at lightspeed, it could cover the same distance in a similar time that it takes Qantas's A380 fly the Dallas - Sydney route.
I'm really curious, and this might be a dumb question. We've known Voyager is far away for a while now. Why is this post specifically being upvoted so much? Is there something significant about 15 hours and 42 minutes of light travel?
As a stupid person, can someone explain to me how it got away from us so far and so fast
Interesting to think that it will take approximately another 100000 years to leave our galaxy. And its just our close neighborhood.
What sort of information are they still getting from Voyager 2 or are they just seeing how far it will go now before they lose all contact with it?
Uhh I'm a bit confused what this means someone care to explain what this means?
How is possible communicate with voyager if it is so far and how long takes the messages to arrive to the earth?
That's almost 118 AU if my math is right, which it probably isn't because I suck at math.
So at light speed it would take me still almost 16 hours to arrive at that point...?
Voyager2, please take me with you. My home country and the country i want to serve are both going crazy.
It took my age of 39 years to travel 15h at light speed...
My entire life (so far), everything I've done, in less than a day. 
Somehow this made me feel a little depressed inside. 15 hours of light-travel time - that's the longest distance a man-made object has traveled away from Earth, and it took 40 years. When you think about how distance in the universe is measured by years of light-travel time, you just realize how insanely remote space and the rest of the universe is to us.
I suppose that is the average distance from the Earth, because the Earth is approximately 8 light minutes from the sun on average, which means that voyagers (and any other body outside of Earths gravitational well's) distance would vary up to 16 light minutes.  Wouldn't it be more accurate to judge its distance from Sol instead?
I like to think that our first mission of light speed travel will be to bring this guy back home.
Apologies if its been answered (no ctrl+f on mobile), but how does Voyager communicate with earth? Or are these only estimations?
Even voyager2 has a twitter account. Maybe it's time to get on board
For reference Andromeda is 2.5 million light years away from Earth. This probe could fly for millions of years and it'd never reach Andromeda.
This may be *really* stupid, but considering time dilation, what "year" is it for the voyager? Like is it already looking at us in the past or is it not far away enough yet? 
Mankind's Monolith to the universe.

I can't help but wonder how many alien planets have reached to our level of tossing objects out into space and what are the odds of bumping into each other's discarded probes, satellites, and trash.
Considering it takes 8 seconds for light to reach earth from the sun that is very impressive 
We are still so pathetically slow. 39 years to go 15 light hours.

Where is a decent warp drive when you need one?
If NASA can build a made in USA space craft that can travel 15 freaking light hours away from here why does my car basically fall apart after 140000 miles or so?
At 16 hours light travel  Voyager2 will be approximately 0.0006 parsecs away. Is it V'ger yet? 
I had to laugh at myself here cuz I saw nsf in op's /u/ and thought Not Safe For voyager2 instead of National Science Foundation.
I don't get how this time measurement works. I know that speed of light is 299 792 458 m / s,  so does that mean that distance is 1 second of light speed away?


So if this is 15 hours... Does this mean that's like... I dont even want to do the math. 

Something about Voyager 2 gives me a warm feeling inside..... To know that long after humans are dead, this machine, made by us, will be floating through space, farther than we could ever dream of going. Who knows if it'll ever be found and the golden plaque ever understood. Probably not. But nevertheless, this is our way of telling other beings if it is found, that we exist, or that we existed. The Eternal Wanderer. 
It's gonna take a fuckin long time to get anywhere aha. If the closest star is 1 light year away, it's barely made it through the first day to get there.
Further out than we've ever been with equipment older than my first computer
**Math problem for the nerds:**

Assume we take one single frame picture that captures the entire milky way galaxy.  Imagine standing outside the galaxy, with the camera perpendicular to the disk.  (not edge on) Finally, assume Voyager is moving parallel to the disk.

Using a full frame, 30MP camera with a 35mm lens, how far away will voyager need to be before the light of the sun, and the light of voyager no longer share the same pixel?
It can post to twitter from wayout there and i cant get a signal from my basement smh
How does one verify a space probe's Twitter account? Clearly no one has figured that one out yet.
Please have a thought for the little robots on Mars that stayed alive for years instead of the very short time we expected them to live. Those two little robots, Spirit and Opportuniy, are still there. Battling the winds, the cold nights, with the sky and the universe above them.
It's just going to go in a giant circle and then crash back into earth in 1,000,000,000 years.

Edit: Wait... will earth be gone? ****X-Files theme****
What is this close to 11 billion miles? Light travels close to 670 million miles per hour right? The fact we are receiving a signal still is just nuts.
It is sad to think one day this thing may be sending messages back to Earth and no humans will be here to hear them.
So does it take 15 hrs 42 mins and 37 sec for that tweet to be transmitted back to earth?
The fact that the instruments won't have enough power to operate soon upsets me more than it probably should.

Hopefully it can find another star in a billion or so years and boot up again...
I thought Voyager was 70,000 light years away and stranded in the Delta Quadrant.  
Almost 40 years at 37,000MPH, and it still hasn't even made it 1/365th of a light year. 

The universe is big. 

Just sayin'
Still a few light days before it get's to the halfway point of OP's mom's ass. 
How does it tweet? Or have any communication? I lose cell signal outside of the city. 
Just curious: If Voyager was destroyed in this exact moment, how long would it take us to find out?
That's an insane distance. How does it transmit data to us and how long does it take at this point? 
What do you think our solar system looks like from that far away?  Would we be a bright horizon or just another twinkling beacon in the blanket of stars?  
All I can think about is this little probe smearing itself on the side of a massive extraterrestrial spaceship like a bug on a windshield.
That's just awesome how NASA knows where exactly it is despite it being so far away. 
For some perspective the earth is about 8 light minutes away from the sun.
Or 0.001792 light years.  Further than I'd thought, but still nowhere at all.
Kinda weird to think about that maybe right now they are reading us as history material, from a different live form.
How does something on space have Internet to post things like this? I dont get it
BTW, light travels about 1 ft in 1 nanosecond or 1 billion feet in one second so you can use that to find the distance of you want.
How do they calculate seconds, do they like, put that in at the time it was being written, or do they go back to it and put in the current seconds and immediately click submit?
Now imagine if we've invented near light travel how laughable this years of Voyager's travel would suddenly become.
Is it saying that in about 16 hours it will have traveled one light year?
Voyager 2 launched on August 20, 1977, has been traveling for 14,339 days and is only 15 hrs away if I were to travel to it at the speed of light. That is awesome. 
That's nothing, you should see the other guy (Voyager 1 is 19+ hours away at the speed of light)
So how far is it in relation to voyager 1 roughly? And how long will it take to reach the next potential system traveling at this speed? Cmon you scientists, this is your time to shine 🌞
What if is started coming back towards us, from the opposite direction?
There are many things about the Voyager that blows my mind. Today it is realizing that we kind of know where it is this far from the earth.
15 hours seem like a long time but voyager has been out for decades. Crazy. 
I wonder. Was this tweet send when Voyager was this distance, or did it arrive on Earth at that time. (I know it was made by someone on Earth. Let a man have his fun)
How long does it take for it to phone home?  And how does it send/receive?  
We still have comms with this thing?

How far out can it send back info?

Also, Trying to imagine a vast infinite blackness that has no end makes me smell toast.
how is data communicated between the voyager and earth? radio waves?
Are the transmitters that powerful.. How much further before it cannot communicate back to mother Earth 
[deleted]
~0.0018 light years.... Voyager2 is stil > 99.9% closer to us than any other solar system.

If memory serves me right that's as near as makes no difference to four times further than Neptune. 
Let's hope it's never found by anyone advanced enough to use it to find and travel to our location
I thought 15 hours 42 minutes isn't that long, then i remembered it's light travel time.
Wouldn't it be so cool if someday in the future we could go reach it (as our technology would have evolve)
Wow! Thats less than 1000au and the ort cloud is about 5,000 to 100,000au which means she has a long way to go.
Well sure, but he sent that almost 16 hours ago so now he's even further.
So is communication done through quantum entanglement? Is this what "Star Trek" suggests as subspace? 
So what is the time difference Voyager is currently experiencing not being tied to a large gravitational body?    
[deleted]
Closest star is ~4.6 light YEARS away. Really puts things in perspective.

EDIT: I mean closest star not including the sun obviously
Wait is it still powered, I know it's not tweeting but is it still "on"?
"Yeah but that's 15 hours and 42 minutes of light travel away from New York Ty"
Voyager2 left Earth on September 5, 1977. That was, as of the writing of this, 14,323 days ago. 15 hours, 42 minutes, and 37 seconds works out to a grand total of 56,557 light seconds. 14,323/56,557 = 3.94. So, on average, the Voyager2 probe travels away from Earth as a rate of about 4 light seconds per day
Is there a graphic with a timeline/location projection of Voyager's travels? Where will it be in 10-100K years?
And Earth is 8 light minutes from the sun... This little guy is really really far away from us.
What kind of time measurement is 2016:327:000000:2L?   It ain't ISO 8601.  Although it's 2016, the 327th day is tomorrow.  What does the 2L at the end mean?  Is it a designator for the Lima military time zone (as opposed to the Zulu military time zone)?
If my math is correct, that's 10,546,200,000 miles (10.55 billion miles).

186,000 (mps)

x60 (mpm)

x60 (mph)

x15.75 (current distance in light-hours)

= 10,545,200,000 miles.
So does that mean it took 15+ hours for that message to be received from the time it was sent? (Sounds like a stupid question, I just want to make sure I understand this whole 15 light hours away thing)
15 hours is 54000 seconds
42 minutes is 2520 seconds
37 seconds left over

That's 56,557 seconds of light travel. 

Light travels at 299,792,458 m/s

That makes it 16955362047106 meters away

In a little easier path that's 16,955,362,047.106 km away

At that point Voyager 2 was over 16billion km away, or just under 10billion miles away.

This however is only 0.00179 light years away
In case you were wondering, and I was, looked it up: 5,879,000,000,000 miles... about six quadrillion. 
Is there a list somewhere of what year it'll reach certain points on its proposed journey?
I was expecting this to be some space porn with a twitter handle like that. I'm not disappointed, not, one, bit.
I did the math and I believe we are looking at another 22,922 years before it is one lightyear away.  If it continues at the same distance/time that it has thus far.
186282.3959 miles per sec... i always try to remember that at least...
[deleted]
Will there be a point when we will no longer be able to tell how far voyager 2 has gone and if so how long
168 million miles away. Thank you google and thank you voyager2 crew. Still can't fathom how far that is. Janikowski could *probably* make it through. 
*Now that I know how far it really is, Janikowski might fall a yard short.
What I want to know is does this somehow communicate instantly with Earth, despite the distance? If so, why does it take 5 minutes for someone sitting next to me to get a text I send them.  If not, then did it calculate this travel time for where it was when it sent the message or where it would be when we received the message? 
I am not impressed,  emdrive will be there in 0.23 seconds of light travel 
I really want them to aim the first EM drive test in such a way that if it does continuously produce thrust deep in space, that it can catch and overtake Voyager.
It'll be huge when he's 24 hours away. Only 364 more to go for a light year, except it's slowing down so it'll take a lot longer.
Which is 10.53 billion miles, if you tried to walk that far, it would take you over 361 thousand years.
When it wrote that message did it take in account the time it took for Earth to recieve the message? 
Serious: How do we still get transmission from something so far away? Or do we just know its speed so we can estimate its distance?

Also, what is Voyager 1 doing?
Isn't it less work to just link to the tweet rather than save a screen shot, crop it, upload it, and then link to the imgur picture?

I guess it's also less work to not even reply like this, but here I am doing it.

FUCK!!! That was self-defeating. We are all dumber for having read this. I award me no points, and may god have mercy on my soul.
Fun Fact: the voyager II has enough juice to be operating for about 45 years.   2020 is the estimated time of deplete
Can someone ELI5 how we are still communicating with Voyager2? I'm working in the telecom business but there's no way I'm able to grasp how we are communicating with an object that far away.
http://i.imgur.com/eXRSkU4.jpg

However fast this thing is moving, it's not even half as fast as earth traveling around the sun.
How can you communicate over a distance of 16.967.100.000 kilometers? i mean how freakin big must the antenna be?
Man that's crazy. If Voyager 2 were heading towards the closest star to our solar system (which is 4 light years away). It would only be around 0.04% of the way there.  (My math could be completely wrong though) 
just to put things into perspective.. It took 40 years to travel a distance which can be covered in 15 hours by light !.. That's like Sydney to New York
Sorry if it's a dumb question but, can we see Voyagers from Earth?

Like,  from the telescope that China built recently?
Can someone explain the significance of this particular distance? I've kept track of the distance for voyager 1 and 2 for a while just out of curiosity, but why is this distance so special? Is this considered interstellar space?
All the programming language jokes are cute. But there was no Twitter API, PHP, HTML, etc etc etc when this craft was programmed. You kids these days. There was no internet. Quaint that you think it's always existed. 
Bah, eventually the thing is going to fall off the edge.  Everyone knows the universe is flat.   Jees you science type...
It'd be ironic if, at some point in the future, we could fly out and get it back and that only took a long weekend or something.

Space taxi driver : "You've been travelling how long? If you'd waited I could have got you here in a day or 2 mate"
How long did it take for us to receive this message? And by the time we received this message how much further in light travel was Voyager 2? 
When I first saw this I didn't see it was Voyager2 and I thought it was some post in r/iamverysmart
I am wondering if communicating with it will eventually become very difficult. 

I am sure there must be a lag of over 15 hours in communication already, if it takes light 15 hours to travel wherever in the space it is right now. 


can some engineer guy explain to me why in space RF doesnt attenuate unlike here on earth? is this because it uses some high radio frequency compare to my wifi 2.4ghz?
You can keep up with them here: http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/index.html
The real question is, did the posting time take into consideration that the message would be posted 15 hours and 42 minutes after it was actually sent?
When it was launched decades ago, was it then projected to still be communicating with us today or has it surpassed expectations?
8.3 light hours to go until it’s one full light *day* away. 8.3 light hours is awfully close to 9 billion kilometers.

At its current speed of 57,890 kph, that means within about 6450 days it will be one light day away? Soo.. Midsummer 2034? 

To be more precise, Voyager 2 will be one light day away on or around Tuesday July 11th, 2034, not that the numbers I have access to have enough decimal places to really say that with any confidence. 
How does it tweet? Is it like pre-programmed after a certain time it will tweet a light year distance?
Did they account for the time it took the message to travel that distance?
Is Voyager just "coasting" at 55,000 km/h right now, or are its thrusters active, increasing its velocity?

Assuming that its "coasting", can we expect Voyager 2 to reach a full light day away from the Sun around 2035?  I did not account for likely course adjustments around its fly-bys of Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune.
Interesting!  How does Voyager 2 communicate back to us?  And how long does that take?  I can't possibly believe that it is able to aim a communication at us, and just... hit send, and it makes it...?
They chose a good name because voyager is so far out that it's almost like it's on a voyage or something. I love weird little coincidences like this :)
Does this take into account the time it takes the message to reach us?
Considering the sun is 8 light seconds away, that is a quantum fuck load of distance. 
Totally thought the Twitter handle was NSFWVoyager at first, and was trying to picture what kinda of dirty things the Voyager would tweet about space. "Ah yeah, that's a sweet black hole" or something like "ain't no better feeling than space sucking you real hard". 
Some day Voyager 2 will be recovered and put in museum. How glorious wouldn't it be to be seeing it at the Air and Space Museum explaining to my grandkids how no one in 2016 could just catch up to it and that where it was caught only seemed close to them.
This is off [its 31 light hours away](http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/)
If we tweet it, will it respond? How did the 70s engineers fit a twitter capability on on it? 
How many light years from where the Sun doesnt shine? You know... Uranus?
Chromatic Aberration (a lens defect)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration

http://prometheus.med.utah.edu/~bwjones/2013/06/digiscoping-the-moon/

there's [practically] no atmosphere on the moon :)

(edit: although we'd still consider it a pretty good vacuum by earth standards:)

nope thats chromatic aberration in a telescope.  if you look at a bright star you should see the same thing.
Chromatic aberration, caused by low quality optics. Moon's atmosphere is not detectable optically.
Hmm never noticed it on any other photos I've taken with it. Also moon does have a very small atmosphere. https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LADEE/news/lunar-atmosphere.html
you can design spacecraft with one person technically. however that person would need to be an expert in controls, propulsion, structures, etc. not many of those people exist, if any.

so probably at least 5-10 engineers, to get 1-2 subject matter experts in each area for the spacecraft. 
How many carpenters does it take to build a house?

When you realize that that is a stupid question, you will have the answer to yours.
Rocket construction can have a massive footprint of subcontractors. SpaceX may be more streamlined in that regard, but I know for sure that constructing each Energiya involved *one million people* and the Saturn V clocked in around six hundred thousand. Most of them would be welders or otherwise non-scientists. 
Very few, you need a lot more software engineers than guidance or propulsion experts.
really beautiful cinematic footage
Gemini re-entry footage is used for the Trans Lunar Injection burn at 5:20, nice work otherwise. 
Great layout. But woefully short on anything showing what the company does... Even the "What we've accomplished" section is blank. No pics, no vids, no descriptions.
Who are you? 

Are you this person? https://twitter.com/hk950production (Craig Willits)

Do you have any experience or training in rocket science? 

Most importantly, do you have cash to burn? And why is it a .org?
Mi first impression about the page:

The webpage is OK, but the logo isn't very good, and that's a bit strange. But it's easily explained with web templates, so your web doesn't give good vibrations.

And then, like other people said, no info about what you do, no pics, but the Donate Now button is already operative.

PD: Looks funny the motto with "affordable space exploration (not really remember what it said) starts with you", like in Portal 2's Aperture Science ;)
Can I just bring up the fucking banner for that article. That's a unicorn in space pooping microwaves for thrust.
Can't we crank up the power to induce a larger thrust, making variables easier to identify?
Its not as haphazard as the article makes it out to be..They give reference material to suggest how the physics may work. See pilot waves. 
You don't see debris whizzing by because:

* Debris tends to be very small (as in smaller than a few cm), or it would be tracked and the ISS would be steered away from it. Small debris like that would be invisible on the camera.

* Debris tends to slow down and spiral in towards the planet. It depends a bit on the mass of the debris and the altitude, but in general nothing stays at the ISS's altitude for more than a few months or at most years. Even the massive ISS itself slows down and needs a boost now and then to keep it in orbit.

* Debris doesn't leave a trail that high up, so if you can't see the (tiny) debris itself, it's invisible.

* Speed differences in space tend to be huge (unless the debris originated from the ISS itself), so debris might not be in front of the camera for more than a single frame, if that.

* Even though there are somewhere between hundreds of thousands and millions of pieces of debris in orbit around the earth, space is big. Really big. That's many, many cubic kilometers per piece. Just like asteroid fields aren't like in the movies, the debris is so spread out that (unless the debris-causing event is very recent or was in a very similar orbit) you're not even likely to be close to any one piece of it, never mind close enough to see it.
Satellites wouldn't usually happen to pass the ISS, there's a significant amount of space that separates satellites. Also, the ISS does get hit by small meteorites, usually they don't do much.
I think there are three points that explain that:

Firstly space debris is a real concern and it does not need to be as dense as movies want you to think. There generally are huge differences in velocities between two objects (eg. the station and a piece of debris). So an object can be a direct danger if it's still a long distance (but not necessarily a long time) away. If the ISS were to float in a big soup of slowly tumbling debris it wouldn't be that much of a problem since the relative speeds are very low.

Besides that, we know where the ISS is located, so people who send stuff up make sure they don't park their satellite in an orbit close to the station. Space is big. When you're talking about something that is close in this context it could easily still entail a few miles. You wouldn't be able to recognise a satellite if it was parked on the ground a few miles in the distance. Neither would you if it were to float by in outer space. 

Finally a lot of debris burns up in the atmosphere. The ISS is located in LEO (Low Earth Orbit) which really isn't that high. Our atmosphere still has influence on objects floating around there. The ISS needs a reboost once in a while because it's being dragged down by the atmosphere. Small debris-like objects are lighter and have less surface so they will generally be dragged down quicker.

Space is really, impossibly huge.  The volume of the whole entire earth is 6.36x10^6 m^3.  The volume contained by GEO is 8 magnitudes greater than that, 3.14x10^14 m^3.  Contained within that massive sphere are 500,000 objects the size of a marble, or larger.  That is a whole lot of empty space per object, on average.

Of course, most of them are bunched up in in the common orbits that the bulk of our space missions are launched into.  Even then, they are pretty sparse.  Between 10 and 30 times a day, one of those objects will come within 25km to the front or back and 5km to the sides, top or bottom of the ISS.  That's only once or twice an orbit.  Keep in mind that most of these are smaller than a softball.

NASA only worries about the debris if it is going to come within 5km along its orbital track, or within 2km to the side, top or bottom.  If they have a 1 in 100,000 chance of a collision then they might do a maneuver to avoid the debris.  They'll definitely do one if there is a 1 in 10,000 chance.  The last time that they had a 1 in 10,000 chance was in 2012.  That is why you don't see stuff streaming past it on a regular basis, and why Kessler Syndrome is a bit overblown.

As for the smaller debris and micrometeorites, they have layers of shielding protecting every component, ranging from aluminum to kevlar.  They only have one collision with an object about 2mm in size every six months on average.
Because reality has more then what you need, while CGI only has what you need...but if asked enough eventually the CGI will include whatever is in question. Just a matter of time like all the other updated CGI material.

Or you could just believe the sun has never reflected off of any satellites in any space video footage.
Sadly, no. Niburu is more of a crystal magick ESP pyramid homeopathic planet. 
No. Nibiru is the subject of a doomsday story, originating from a woman claiming to be telepathically contacted by aliens from Zeta Reticuli. It was supposed to have blown past Earth in 2003, upsetting the axis of rotation and destroying humanity.

Since 2003 has obviously passed without incident, the myth has been permutating, with different dates, locations and names. Batygin's Planet Nine is simply their latest bandwagon; we've had no less than three conspiritard threads on this sub yesterday.

The closest to the official name is "Tyche", which was a previous and similar hypothetical Planet Nine candidate ruled out by WISE.
The title is kind of misleading, NASA is developing the impactor. ESA will be developing the orbiter that is suppose to observe the impact.
TL;DR version: The same reason you can't see them on Earth during the day.
I'm sorry, am I an idiot? Should this be titled "Why you can't see stars IN PHOTOGRAPHS on the Moon"? Cause I'm pretty sure if you were standing on the "night time" side of the moon you would see a shit ton of stars, no?
Created for my visual communication Honours final project over the past few months, and I've been very excited to share it here. Please do share any feedback / critique too, thanks Reddit!
I didn't even read the story, the visuals were captivating. Especially liked the distance traveled at the end of the first chapter.
This was awesome. I spent all of half an hour reading that, and I am very glad I did. I would be extremely excited to read anything else like this.
Being a minimal designer & front end developer myself: This is just lovely, I love it! Beautiful typography.. Also the story is really adorable and nice. I really enjoyed it.

Well done mate.

Didn't read the story either, I was playing around with the animations. ^^' It's wonderful!
It won't change. People will likely still celebrate their Earth birthday, and maybe have a smaller celebration for their "Mars arrival" "marsiversary" each martian year.

It will take a loooong time and probably being born on mars until people start to only celebrate their martian birthday.

But even while living on mars, things like legal age etc. will still be measured in terms of earths years for the forseeable future, and so the earth birthday will stay relevant for a looong time.
Quite a few hard sci-fi series use the idea of "standard" or "Earth standard" to denote a conversion to the Earth timings.  
So you can discuss things in terms of local years or local hours or whatever...but everyone knows the conversion to "standard" years, etc. ("That building's been here for 23 years." "What is that, 12 standard?" or "The days on this planet are 1.5 standard.")
  
  
I'm sure the first couple generations would stick to Earth units, but I'd guess that eventually patriotism or practicality (an Earth year doesn't work with one cycle of Mars' 6 seasons) would lead to them using their own.
We'll just have to adjust to a calender system that holds true to the entire solar system, then the galaxy, then the universe.
Since we evolved on earth our natural sleep cycle works off a 24 clock. As such I would be more worried about what a day on mars would be like if we maintained a 24 hour clock.
Time has to be measured relative to *something*. The scale is too large outside of our solar system for anything to be practical, so we'd likely stay within it. Nothing within our solar system makes more sense than the orbit of the planet we evolved on, so I think earth years would persist.    
Offices already have clocks that keep time in other countries, since its important for business, so why not the same for other planets? 
I have worked in environments where things went 24/7/365 and you only saw the sun by choice.

What happens is the days and hours just start to blur together. 7 am isn't morning it is time something happens.

With that said I am betting they would retain the earth calendar.
Well we wont have to worry about it because humans probably wont achieve anything like that before we go extinct

That sounds exactly like a signed integer or floating point number overflowed and thus wrapped around. An extremely common and preventable programming mistake.

As background, computers store numeric data in a limited way which means you have to be careful what numbers you try to store. Variables have minimum and maximum values that you must not exceed. If you do, they overflow. Many systems handle overflow by causing the variable to wrap around to the opposite extreme. As an example, if you add 1 to a signed integer whose current value is 32,767 (the maximum positive value), you end up with −32,767 (the maximum negative value).

Sorry but there's no excuse for not having triple redundant IMU measurements to prevent this exact thing. That's poor design. 
Thanks

We used to get decals of the mission patches for every shuttle launch but that ended before the shuttle program did.  I've got a few here somewhere.  I'll see if I can find them and share.
Hey everyone, I recently came across some old mission patches that i inherited from my Grandfather when he passed away a couple of years ago. I nabbed them as soon as they were offered as his stories of working in the space industry always inspired me, so these were a great thing for me to keep and remember him with. I put them aside when i got them and came across them again today and though they might be worth sharing. I doubt theres much historical merit to them (we always used to tease him about launching Skynet though!).

Much of what he did was (and as far as i know still is) classified, but he was pretty high up the chain at British Aerospace, and the stories he could tell were always quite amazing. He once told me about how he crashed two rental cars on a level crossing somewhere in America to stop a train that would have caused an aborted launch of a military sattelite, just because he wanted to be back in the UK for Christmas. He learned after the launch that he could have just asked the train driver to stop! oops!

Anyway, enjoy the pictures, I enjoy reading this page so thought it would be nice to share something with you all.
Amazing Grace got one too, although sadly too late. Well deserved on both counts.

A WOMEN puts Men on MOON : https://www.wired.com/2015/10/margaret-hamilton-nasa-apollo/
It's great she got this award but it make me wonder what exactly did Ellen DeGeneres do to deserve the same medal. 
Sorry.

Say Margaret Hamilton and [she](https://girlsdofilm.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/the_wizard_of_oz_margaret_hamilton_7.jpg?w=800) pops into my head.
Everyone alive is in this one picture. Dammit! I had my eyes closed.

Makes me think. We might destroy this planet for no reason, burn all life known to us to the ground, but the universe will go on. It won't even notice, really. And that makes me strangely happy.
[Earth's other moons](http://www.universetoday.com/92022/earths-other-moons/), mind you, those are small, temporary captures, so calling them moons is a bit of a stretch.
Could someone photoshop this picture to include all planets between the earth and moon, relative to size and photo quality?
We have a huge moon for such a relatively small planet. I wonder how much it has to do with our not having any other permanent natural satellites? If something like Phobos or Deimos came near the Earth, would the moon disturb its orbit enough to make it unstable?
I wonder how expensive something like that would be. Would be a super cool idea though!
As long as it doesn't use pentile subpixels matrix arrangement (so, at least 3 subpixels per pixel; red, green, blue), and isn't over saturated, and the gamma level isn't screwed (especially for dark shades) then it would be cool.
Unfortunately, most AMOLED panels (and LCD ones too) that look gorgeous have oversaturated colors and screwed gamma levels, I know they can be calibrated, but after calibrating them to be "color acurate", they don't look gorgeous anymore (to average person's eyes).
Wouldn't that require an hemispherical screen though? That would be cool as hell, flat screens are getting old fashionned anyway, time to spice things up. :)
Wow, this is some of the most blatant advertising I've seen in a while. Also completely off topic
Does it have increased resolution, or just an improved update rate?

(And does it have two minion satellites called Zuul and Vinz Clortho?)
What's with this recent trend of putting the "after" picture first?
I believe the time machine used to capture the footage on the left is way more impressive than some weather satellite. 
All I want is color images like the [Himawari-8](http://rammb.cira.colostate.edu/ramsdis/online/loop_of_the_day/).

[\(The satellite that took this\)](http://i.imgur.com/jrZLF5U.gifv)
[Source from NOAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9goWgq55xL0). I found this older video last week before the launch, and thought it was a pretty impressive overview of just how much better data US weather forecasting is going to get.

Edit: just woke up to see this blown up at +7k, so here's the answers to a few FAQ:

1) It can see color as well, this is just a demo of its fast-scan imaging. 16 spectral bands of color actually (humans only see 3, and the previous satellites only saw 5). 

2) It [launched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AFhtNHw8Hw) into space this past Saturday on a ULA AtlasV rocket. Will take 3 months to get the first pictures and about a year to get up and fully running, so don't expect the weather forecasting to start getting better until then. 

3) There's more cool stuff on board as well - the first GSO lightening mapper, and a whole suite of space weather monitors. 

4) I too hate the 'before' picture being on the left. 

5) How did they get the 'after' picture? They have been experimenting with 1 min rapid-scan for specific storms on the current satellites, but it comes at the cost of not scanning elsewhere. The new one will be able to provide 30 sec scans on top of everything else. [Comparison of tech specs](http://www.goes-r.gov/spacesegment/abi.html). 

Edit2: [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/5e8ui8/heres_what_the_incredible_leap_in_weather_imaging/dab14bz) has some more good links, including an old AMA from the GOES-R team. 
Console meteorologists counter that weather looks way more "cinematic" at 12fps.  
hold on...They named the satellite after Gozer?                                     A.K.A. Gozer the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor, Gozer the Traveler, Volguus Zildrohar and Lord of the Sebouillia?  
Don't we already have this? I've watched high fps videos of hurricanes from space.
For all the shit the US government gets, it truly is a service to the world. Rock on NASA and NOAA. 
So wait....if the future is later, then how do we have this example now?
Good Lord, the eye of that hurricane is so fast compared to everything else.
Question for any stray meteorologists here: I notice in the second half of the gif, in the high fps capture, there are points in the clouds where there seems to be "welling up".  Are these the updrafts fueling the storms?  Because if so, this really gives me a new perspective on how clouds are formed.
They used Wisconsin in the second half of the gif, I could literally see where I live from space. Amazing.
"Hey if we're gonna fuck the climate over let's at least record it in hi-def."
GOES-R? Really?

Like [Gozer, the Destroyer](http://static.srcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Gozer-Ghostbusters-1984.jpg)?
So is this going to change what every weather radar looks like (as in the colored pressure maps that show the last couple hours in increments of time)? 
Seems very similar to the Himawari 9 satellite that JAXA launched a couple weeks back, and the Himawari 8 that is already in operation. The Advanced Baseline Imager used in GOES-R is nearly identical to the Advanced Himawari Imager used in both satellites, and is built by the same company. I wonder if GOES-R can do color images, like the Himawari satellites.
Holy shit, I've never been so excited for another big hurricane to hit

Edit: That sounds worse now that I reddit aloud
I keep reading GOES-R as Gozer the Gozerian and I wonder who am I gonna call? 
Why is the "future" graphic so much better than the "current" graphic if both are using the same current technology? If we can make that "future" one already, why don't we?

edit: Found a good answer. Thanks u/TripleChubz 
>The current satellite system does both the intermittent scan we see on the right and is occasionally ordered to do the rapid scans like we see on the left. The new satellite will be dedicated to doing the rapid scans as part of it's normal workflow. That said, the new satellite will have greater resolution and will see in more spectrums. It will also transmit data to Earth much faster, allowing for more accurate predictions and closer to real time monitoring.

https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/5e8ui8/heres_what_the_incredible_leap_in_weather_imaging/daaw91g/?st=ivturxcy&sh=028e8e00
NOAA’s current GOES satellites were built with 1990s hardware, and if you want an analogy for the technological leap GOES-R represents, just think about your first computer 20 years ago compared with what’s sitting on your desk today. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), GOES-R’s primary weather-monitoring instrument suite, is speedier, higher resolution, and overall far more capable than its predecessors.

“Our current [geostationary satellite] cameras do the entire western hemisphere, from the north pole to the south pole, every 30 minutes,” Eric Webster of Harris Corporation, which built the ABI, tells Gizmodo. “The Advanced Baseline imager can do the full disc in fifteen minutes, the US in five, and a hurricane every 30 seconds.” It does so at a resolution of 0.3 to 1.2 miles (0.5 to 2 km) across the entire western hemisphere. From 22,300 miles up, that’s like seeing the ridges on the side of a quarter located a mile away.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQZIRaAZwvY
If you look closely at the clouds in "After", you can see the cumulonimbus/anvil clouds, bubbling and dissipated very quickly.
So we've basically been at the level of speed of PowerPoint this entire time? 
I'm definitely late to the party but I'm a satellite controller for the current GOES-NOP satellites, AMA.
So excited for this dishonored 2 pc patch. My god, just look at that frame rate improvement! 
Isn't the "future" one just the current one and the current just a slowed down current one? The GOES-R Imager is faster but only faster taking pictures of the complete earth at once - which takes a few minutes - not faster making images from individual storms afaik. I think this is a little misleading. What is at least equally important is the higher resolution in my opinion which is not shown here. 
Now we get to see the climate change apocalypse in prestige images. 
Not trying to sound like an idiot but I thought it was moving all choppy on purpose. I thought the point was to kinda show the direction the storm would be over the next amount of short time. I guess I am dumb :D :D :D 
All of the above. Apparently the data collection is exponentially better too which contributes to the real time quality images
Every time I hear it's name, I think of [Gozer's True Form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUaaSR4AbZs)
Ah and now we'll be able to watch the stream live as the gigantic storms of the future flash flood parts of the world due to the ever warming atmosphere. 
Can we not just post dank meme's and actually talk about the science and specifics of such an incredible machine? Shouldn't this be about what /r/space is about?
This looks amazing. Can't wait to be informed in such high def. 

As an afterthought, I wonder who named this satellite...

I am not that worried about GOES-R the satellite, but GOES-R the Traveller, and GOES-R the Destructor make me uneasy. 
The most incredible thing about the GOES-R satellite is the ability to see the future. 
I came here for a Gatekeeper and Keymaster reference, and I was not disappointed (unlike the Shubs and Zulls, I can tell you!)
This may be a dumb question but how did we get the future images if it hasn't launched yet?  Is there another weather satellite already in orbit with the same capacity? 
Until this thing is smart enough to distinguish cloud forms of bunnies and dinosaurs it is a serious waste of resources.
Why are we letting them do this?!?! The new GOES-R is going to make the weather that much faster?
Many Shubs and Zuuls shall know what it is to be roasted in the depths of the Sloar on that day I can tell you!
So it takes video rather than pictures? Why did it take so long to implement this?
GOES-R the Gozarian!  Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you!
"is going to look like"? Looks like it already is looking like that...
How will the technological advances offered by this weather technology be squared with the new administration's non-scientific approach to climate?

Or, in a less passive-aggressive way, how will we be so cool with weather and so uncool with climate? 

It's like being a tree expert, but denying forest science.
Now we'll be able to watch ourselves destroy the Earth in higher frame rates!  /s
So now we can see natural disasters in 60 fps?

Apparently Trump was the right choice.
Being able to see the clouds live like that makes it look a lot like surf. You can see where the break is and everything. 
Is there anyway we can get a TV show that explains these types of images and instruments? I think it would be beneficial.
That's really neat, im glad the launch went on without a hitch. For a second when the video feed cut i tought it blew up.
I came here to make a joke about Gozer the Traveler. *He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the rectification of the Vuldrini, the traveler came as a large and moving Torg! Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the McKetrick supplicants, they chose a new form for him: that of a giant Slor! Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you!* I am prepared for your wrath now.
I dunno bout yall, but I'm pretty hesitant to be dealing with GOES-R and  the second mission, ZUUL. 
I had the chance to tour the station right next to Wallops flight facility on the eastern shore of Virginia where they receive the data sent down by these satellites.  The server room to handle the crazy amount amount of data collected by the new satellites is about 7 times as large as its predecessor.  It looked like a scene from the Matrix.
So excited for this as a meteorology student!  Imagine going from the original iPhone to the 6 plus.
It looks like we already have the future's weather satellite technology on the left.  So let's just look at weather on the left side of the screen for now on and save $40 million dollars.
Looks like these satellites built themselves a PC instead of sticking with a console
Did anyone else read "GOES-R" as [Gozer](http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6py9sFn531rawb5do1_500.jpg) ?
Just make sure that you don't let the creepy barbarian painting touch your baby.
I grew up in [Tornado Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Alley) so looking at weather satellite imagery is a lifelong obsession.

Seeing this has me thinking... Where do the armchair meteorologists gather? I did a google search and it led me back to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/weather/comments/2z7hqr/weather_enthusiasts_what_is_your_recommended/).
How can the future be shown to us now. Shouldn't the future be the present and the present become the past?
Dang son, maybe they can accurately tell me that it's always raining in AK. 
Anybody know why they don't show the old style weather maps with the isobars and the pointy cold front/bumpy warm fronts anymore?
Hey mega thanks OP. I don't know much about the technical side of this announcement but i was stoked hearing about it nonetheless.  
  
Thanks for dropping this GIF, you've effectively doubled my stoked-ness about all this now that i can see the improvement
When the National Weather Service or whoever logs into the system that connects to the satellite it had BETTER ask "Are you a god?" 
Silly question, but could we detonate some kind of device inside a hurricane to disrupt the circular air current; thus ending the event?
My buddy actually worked on the GoesR at Lockheed Martin, smart guy. I asked him what they did to increase resolution and imaging from previous models,apparently it's secret. :/
Why the hell is the future on the right and current on the left?

It's the same as posting a Before & After with the after on the right. It makes no sense and hurts my head! 
I'm surprised we just got to this point. I would have guessed the gif on the right was from the early 2000s
I've never been interested in weather but this would be sweet to live stream.
My grandpa was the project lead for every HOES satellite launch up until about 2007. I got to see one when I was a kid. The most incredible thing I've ever experienced was watching a rocket launch from as close as NASA safely allows. 
What is these white things are? I think this become a trend but what changes are going to happen in next?

Isn't weather satellite code for spy satellite? At least that's what I learned from the movies.

Just think about the fact that this is what civilian weather satellites are capable of. Just imagine what capabilities the NRO has. I would not be surprised if they had crazy resolution like being able to read the name tag off a soldiers uniform in the middle of a war zone
So is this just a CGI example? How did they generate the images we're looking at without the 'future' tech up there?
How long until we see improvements like this on, say, the weather channel?
can we agree as a people that the current should always be on the left?
As a commercial pilot and soon to be flight instructor, as well as a UAS imaging company owner, this will be super helpful in predicting weather.

Oh hi there dearie didn't see you so far up in the clouds there dontchaknow, come on down for some beer and cheese!
Here's a video from the manufacturer of the imager (Harris Corporation) that shows the scanning process it uses to provide different types of images:

As a proud Wisconsinite, I'm glad our state made this GIF, but I'm concerned that a giant hurricane appears to be headed our way.
How would this (and the current GOES system) compare with the Meteosat satellites Europe has?
Nice baloon pictures :) This is why NASA is using all the world's helium and is running out ;) Ooops.
That's an incredible improvement.

Does anyone know whether other regions besides North America will also profit? Does this satellite cover other continents, and would NASA typically share the data with local weather services?

Or could other countries commission an identical satellite to get the same local coverage?
Can someone explain the numerous plumes of steam out of nowhere? Seems unnatural...
One small step for cameras, one incredible leap for weather imaging (cameras).
How the hell have we been getting away with the old satellites? Seriously, a human could make a better prediction with the new data, than the supercomputers extrapolating and making predictions from the old data.
Can we receive the signal of these the same way we can get the older ones, using your own antenna and a dvb-t?
its like the difference in cg between the matrix 1 and the matrix 2

Sooo...they just switched from console to pc to treat the footages?
This is going to be my example on what playing on a 144hz monitor is like
They finally upgraded their graphics card to increase the fps,  nice. 
They can put satellites in space, but just now figured out tweening. 
Thank you for posting this! I've never been so fired up about black and white imagery in my life!
This satellite is going to revolutionize weather prediction and current analysis. My top two favorite this about it are the real-time lightning mapper and the 500 meter resolution for the visible imagery, plus the potential for 30 second updated images. 
Not weather and not geostationary, but if you like HD videos from space, Skybox has a few on YT:

At first, I thought it was a still picture and wondered what was so incredible about it.

The, I realized it was a gif. 
Sorry, I'm not seeing a big difference. yes, the "future" reference is in slightly better focus. but the same information is available in both videos.
Any chance of us lowly Canadians getting better weather coverage out of this?
they will probably still tell us it will be sunny , so you go out without a coat and then we have monsoon like rain.
I'm so glad about this, honestly current weather forecasting is a joke. The sooner it can be improved, the better.
How did they record the "future" one? It looks like it's already possible...
GOES-R? Isn't that the villain from Ghostbusters? Al Roker's about to summon the Sta-Puft Marshmallow Man.
Current forecast:
"Tomorrow we have a 50% chance of rain, either it will or it won't. And we're still keeping watch on where the hurricane will hit the coast, it looks like it could be Florida or South Carolina, but it may swing north and get anywhere from North Carolina to Maine. Watch out you big whigs in DC, haha."

With the new improved satellite that gives us faster pictures the forecast will be more like this:
"Tomorrow we have a 50% chance of rain, either it will or it won't. And we're still keeping watch on where the hurricane will hit the coast, it looks like it could be Florida or South Carolina, but it may swing north and get anywhere from North Carolina to Maine. Watch out you big whigs in DC, haha."
Does this mean the can give us the wrong prediction quicker ... or the wrong prediction in better detail ?
I guess getting the wrong prediction of the weather in Florida will soon be a thing of the past.
It was hard to tell one of them was having trouble loading. It was all jumpy
I have a hard time admitting this is, as described, an "incredible leap."  An incredible leap was putting an image source in orbit.  It seems the replacement is an upgrade, yes, but not an incredible leap.  
so when does this future satellite go live for everyone to have access to it? 
Which continents will be monitored and which meteo institutes will be able to use the data?
If we could only get an upgrade like this for our sun watching satellites ...
Will the public be allowed access to these images? or we are stuck with the weatherchannel reports that use brief sections of images gathered by the sattelite?
Does this mean the weather app on my phone is going to actually be right about the weather later on in my Saturday night when I walk for about two hours in pissing down rain when it said it was gonna be fucking clear skies
Am I the only one who can't really tell the "incredible" difference?
Now, if only we could get them some new computers to make sense of all that imagery 

http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/magazine/why-isnt-the-us-better-at-predicting-extreme-weather.html
So when could we have color whit this? There are ways to get color right!
so what was the challenges before? like how it's hard to get smooth continuous satellite footage?
I thought we all agreed - BEFORE PIC GOES ON THE LEFT!

- and this is really cool.
I thought this was going to be a sarcastic post until I saw it move.
I thought the second one was more, "cinematic".    
You don't need all those frames.
Am I wrong in saying I kind of don't like it? Like, that's just not what the weather is supposed to look like, I've spent a lot of time watching huge storms come in wishing for heavy rain / a snow day as a kid and this is just too much for me. 
I'm surprised it's taking this long to be honest, considering all the other technological advances. 
Hey I guess someone found the missing frames to give to the new satellite
Who will have access to it? I'm not knowledgeable on how satellite technology may or may not be leased/used/etc.
So I hope apps like weather radar use the satellite, then we could see exactly when the rain will hit your area...
Are you saying... we can get live traffic video updates now from satellites?.
It looks a lot smoother but is this really going to help meteorologists make any better predictions? It does not seem to be higher resolution (probably is though) just higher FPS. Seems like this would only help with noticing changing conditions sooner.

Thats probably inherent and I am stupid, my bad.
Can we watch more than the 4 second clip that we can currently view on the NWS website?
Something something the human eye can't see more than something fps something something 
I can barely tell the difference between the two. What a great technological advancement!
My mother sent me a video while she was on vacation of the rocket being launched. It was pretty cool
Is it just me or am I the only one who feels like we should if had this a long time ago 
Plot hole: how did they get the before imagery if the satellite isn't fully online yet?

Checkmate atheists. 

I.am guessing there's another one already online... 
So when I first opened it I had no idea that it was  gif so I stared at if for like a minute while it loaded looking for the difference 
The government can identify me jerking off in my backyard. How come this is just now a thing?
If this is future technology, what is the source of these images?  A simulation?

What area of the world will this cover?

How much is this *actually* going to help in predicting weather though?  Unless there was a massive leap in processing power at weather stations to process this data, sometimes more data is not necessarily better.  
That names makes me think of: https://ilikethingsthataregreat.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/gozer1.jpg
except that its a Gif... making it unusable on any aging pc... doh. 

Question: 
will this leap in imagery affect the current 36Hour limit to weather forecasting?

from OP's gif, i see no benefit on predicting weather. only a better way of viewing past and current weather activity

Gozer the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor, Gozer the Traveler, Volguus Zildrohar and Lord of the Sebouillia!
How does this contribute to weather prediction? Are the inputs that we gather better quality for our weather models?
You see there sonny thats global warming spinning right at us.President Obama told me so.They hide it in fake news storys.
Gozer the Traveler. He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the rectification of the Vuldrini, the traveler came as a large and moving Torg! Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the McKetrick supplicants, they chose a new form for him: that of a giant Slor! Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you!
Im dumb enough to think that showed winds in the future being twice as fast due to global warming lmao
Will this help better  predict the weather or simply show "what's coming" in clearer fashion?
Someone will created an AI which converts the low frame rate to high
I know what it stands for, but I can't help but think of Gozer from Ghostbusters every time I read about this. 
That's amazing how you can see particular locations where the clouds seem to boil up from.
Can someone explain to me why if a satellite is orbiting so quickly it is able to take a video like these without appearing to orbit during it?
Looks basically the same. Waste of money when there are struggling families out there that could put it to better use. 
Surprised someone hasn't done an edit of this gif replacing current with 'console' and future with 'PC'. 
Too lazy for sarcasm or wit so I'll just express my grand excitement. Sweet fucking technological jump! Weather conversations will never be the same.

So NASA finally upgrades from play-station processors? (NASA actually did use a PS processor for the Pluto probe)
How Dangerous ( #HowDangerous ) the future will be with the people gaining more and MORE access to future technology!!🤓🤓

MuhhahahahaMUUHAHAHAHmuhahahaMUHhhAahah... 
aaah! just like the difference in frame rate after using Intel HD graphics and later installing a Radeon R480 / nVidia 1070
Wake up people this is a spy satellite. Sure it can image the weather nicely, but it can also stream footage of you balling fat chicks from the assumed privacy of your motor home.
It's like PC Master Race gaming on the left, and console gaming on the right. 
In the left here you can see what 60fps looks like and in the right you can see what 30fps looks like :PC MASTERRACE:
They couldn't upgrade the thing to color? NASA loves to skimp on the most important thing of any project.
In the future, they will get the shape of Wisconsin completely wrong on weather maps? Seems unlikely...

not exactly sure how this will help predict the weather? but definitely looks awesome
This is cool, and sorry to be a dick about it, but honestly it's 2016 and we should have been getting satellite imaging like this a long time ago.
I almost bookmarked this as "we are all. going. to fing. die lol." 

Thought this was a prediction of the effects of rising global temp on our current weather patters. Sweets Jesus, thank baby Burt Reynolds, its just science doin its thag on meteorological imagery. going to go make sum chamomile tea and watch the snow fall slowly and peacefully now o.0
So basically the old satellite was a console peasant and the new one is from PC master race

There are objects called standard candles that are used to measure distances.  You can read about them and other methods [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder).

The redshift is the shift towards the red end of the spectrum of spectral absorption lines, not the light in general (although that shifts as well).  You can read all about that [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift).
Redshift is typically determined from measuring the frequency/wavelength of emission or absorption lines. For example, excited hydrogen gas in galaxies emits the Hα emission line with a rest wavelength of 656.28 nanometers. The redshift is determined from the difference between the observed and rest wavelength.
The thumbnail showing 1 woman among 5 men made me quite confused at the title. Is this visual clickbait?

Are they trying to see if they're up to the task if their cycles all go in sync?
Imagine how much faster the space program would've happened if there was a planet with water and greenery on it right freaking there
Imagine what the tides would be like on the little one and how often the eclipses would be. 
Fun Fact: 

Technically Pluto and Charon are in a binary planetary system, much like the one in this gif. 
Just a few observations assuming the big planet is about the same size as the Earth:

They complete one orbit in about [10 hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_Earth_orbit#/media/File:Comparison_satellite_navigation_orbits.svg) so each day is also 10 hours.

The small planet is close to the [Roche Limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit). These two planets might be ok. But they should be elongated due to tidal forces (especially the smaller one).

Although tidal forces are extreme in this system there are no tides because neither planet rotates relative to the other.

The place where you would weigh the least in this system is on the near side or far side of the smaller planet. On the far side centrifugal acceleration is trying to fling you from the system (you're moving too fast in your orbit) and on the near side the gravity from the larger planet partly cancels the small planets gravity (You're moving too slow in your orbit)。 You will weigh the most at the poles of the larger planet.

They are fully illuminated so the sun is directly behind the viewer. At equinox the system will be side on to the sun and you'll get eclipses every 10 hours or so. If the [orbital pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_pole) is in the up direction then it's currently summer in the northern hemispheres. On the other hand if the orbital poles are to the left or right then the system is between equinox and solstice and at solstice the sun will remain motionless in the sky at one celestial pole and one half of each planet will be in constant illumination.
[Video of actual binary ^^dwarf planets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrqjsM-QBY4&t=32)
It would be interesting if they shared a thick atmosphere due to being in such close proximity. In such a situation bacteria and potentially even flying animals/insects would be able to get from one planet to the other simply by flying through the atmosphere between the two of them. It would also incentivize evolution to have an organism gain the ability to withstand a lower atmosphere and potentially resistance to cosmic radiation.
Imagine the crazy looking chicks you'd get to bone from the neighbor planet
That big one is gonna have such a shitty climate, based on the position of those continents and seas. Send me to the small one.
[deleted]
If this is to scale; these planets are in their final death spiral. Either they would crash into each other with-in decades or the larger one would rip the smaller to shreds from the tidal forces forming a ring around the larger. This would not be a stable orbit.

[Pluto-Charon](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pluto-Charon_System.gif#/media/File:Pluto-Charon_System.gif) would be the closest analog in the solar system

[Fun n-body gravity simulator](http://jdhcodelab.com/gravity/) for your amusement. 
Now this is more like it. Badass. Trek fan, just makes my science bone tingle?
How does it differ from a planet and its moon? Is the criteria for it that one body must be significantly smaller?
I recommend the [light pollution map](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info). Here you can see places that are not too bright at night :)
It's better to see it on summer though. Because then you'd be able to see the "core" of MW and not its arm. Just like [this](http://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Milky-Way-face-on-edge-on-NASA-Richard-Powell_ANNO.jpg)
I'm not entirely certain what you mean by "scientifically-sponsored", but [SETI](http://www.seti.org/) comes to mind.
What do you mean when you say scientifically-sponsored? Sponsored in a scientific way or sponsored by science? The latter wouldn't really make sense to me as their is no overarching authority to science that could hand out grants. There are however a couple of programmes in the world that search for extraterrestrial life in a scientific way. SETI being the most famous. You can yourself participate here: http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/
The ongoing science campaign on Mars has, as one of its objectives, seeing if there is or was life there.  
Most of the universe is completely full of "things" - there is so little empty space it boggles the mind. 

Take for instance "light". When you go outside on a night with clear skies and look up - you see stars (maybe - you might see downtown Manhattan for all I know). Photons from that star have come from that star and are entering your eyes and you can see the star. If you move over five feet, or fifty miles, you can look at that same star - photons from that star entering your eyes - REGARDLESS WHERE YOU LOOK AT IT FROM, you'll see the light from that star. 

Think about what that means. That means that everywhere outside that star is that star's light (waves - particles - whatever). *EVERYWHERE* is filled with the light given out by that star. And that light is continuous - no gaps or holes, so that space is completely full of that star's light (except in shadows, of course, but that's only for the "present moment" when that star's light is cut off by something). And not just in the "present" but coming in just a second or ten or days or years later - all of space is filled in every direction with the light from that star. Now multiply that by the number of stars...

...and this is just light.

Space is a lot of things, but empty? Nope.

I assume that's the lander after it was down? I looks like its without the lower stage unless they folded it well.
You kind of assume every human lives on one side of Earth. And being pedantic we can only see a little over half of one side. So it's even less. So, yeah.

Though I get your point, and it's amazing nonetheless. But then again for that statement I prefer the pale blue dot. :)
This sounds like a fun fact, but if you get a 360 camera you can do this too :P
If I lay flat on my belly on a mountain that statement is probably true also.
3.6 billion in 1969, 7.3 billion almost 50 years later. Millions growing so technically illiterate, the accomplishments of half a century ago look like magic and trickery. It was decided in 1972 to seek extinction on the little blue ball rather than become an interplanetary species. The directive was "look down at the ground and it is forbidden to look up".  Another 20 years to even have the capability of keeping a human ape alive  on Mars, much less giant troupes. By then, the chaotic global warming will be recognized by the most block headed dunderheads. If there is Global Thermonuclear War in the meantime, the extinction comes even faster. The human ape fails the IQ test .
Nope .... lots were not even born when this was taken, and a whole pile of them have died before it was done as well. 
In 1969, the Earth's population was 3.6 billion. In 2016, it is 7.3 billion.  The population doubled in less than 50 years, and even though the birth rate has dropped, will double again in 30 years. Double the population means double the consumption needs of each human ape. More air, more water, more food, more clothing, more transportation, all consuming that thin layer that makes carbon-life possible.  
  
With 14 billion population in 30 years, there will be a very narrow Window Of Opportunity (WOO) where the human ape becomes an interplanetary species, crosses over from a Type I civilization to a Type 2 civilization, that has stopped fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emissions, and approaching zero population growth with indefinite longevity. Otherwise, if the WOO is missed, the human ape goes from a Type I civilization to a Type 0, continues burning fossil fuels because they are cheaper, keep reproducing 2 or more children per generation, depletes critical resources, watch vegetation die off from drought and disease due to changing environments. It is the sheeples choice and they have been tending to bleet their vote lately, choosing the latter.

i doubt the yellowstone caldera is something you can relieve pressure of, its too big. certainly not economically feasible for a small small chance of an event
by that logic, literally ANYTHING can be talked about here because it's all "in space". To your credit, I can't think of a better place to post it though. I think you run into collateral damage of such an action, risking wildfires and smoke choking the air, on top of risking setting that beast off yourself. magma pools build up pressure under the earth's surface and when the pressure overcomes the weakest point containing that pressure, it blows, spewing lava in every direction. I think your idea would compromise it's seal and rain hell on us all
This plan does not have enough explosions.

An eruption of the Yellowstone supervolcano wouldn't come anywhere near killing everyone in North America, let alone everyone on Earth. It would *suck*, certainly, but it's erupted many times before and we know how big a pop it would be based on old ash strata.

[Here's an article modeling predictions of Yellowstone ashfall](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GC005469/full). Much of North America doesn't even get a full centimeter. Also, there's no indication that an eruption is likely to happen any time soon. We're fine.

If an eruption *were* imminent, though, there's not really anything that could be done. "venting the pressure" isn't really a thing that can be done on a practical scale, gasses don't diffuse through magma very rapidly so the only way to get it to release them would be to set off the eruption you're trying to prevent. Best bet would be to just evacuate the states that would be most severely hit, make sure everyone in the medium-threatened states have shovels and know they'll need to wear a cloth over their faces while keeping the ash from accumulating on their roofs, and see that a goodly stock of preserved food is available to deal with a year or two of terrible crops.
It's probably in the best interests for the rest of the species of this world if it blew up and resulted in our extinction before we kill off everything else. 
That's some pretty serious clickbait you got going there...

If you read past the headline, most of the links go to the author's own site and the only primary source he provides is Ingraham and "Citizens for the Republic" complaining about a billion dollar grant to SolarCity from back in 2015. painting this as Trump going after SpaceX is quite the stretch.
They're probably just worried that SpaceX will notice that the Earth isn't flat when they get waaay up there.
Except that this has nothing to do with Trump. Otherwise we'd be hearing from Breitbart, who don't seem to have jumped on the bandwagon despite being headed by Trump's literal chief propagandist.
This is complete and utter BS. Trump is a YUUGE supporter of SpaceX, and the private industry. That's EXACTLY the kind of thinking he's trying to push. 

Edit: Musk himself just stated that these are "fake pieces" and the writers are "simply trolls"

Great tip!

[2016 Astronomy Club index for the US.](http://www.go-astronomy.com/astro-club-search.htm)
Awesome tip! I'm considering buying a pretty pricey telescope. I'm truly new to cosmology and skygazing. This might be a solid way to test out scores abs bake in a little knowledge too.

Thanks OP  ^ +1
I think of the Universe as infinite and generally flat - it has no boundary, as 'existence', as it were, can be defined as regions where spacetime and matter exist. There is no outside of that because you cannot reach a point where you are beyond that and looking back to it, at least not in our accessible dimensions.

You could though imagine the universe as a 'hypersurface' of a higher-dimensional structure or plane. From this 'outside' perspective, any creatures of this higher dimension could observe the entirety of the universe and the boundaries, if any, as well as interacting with different times and areas at will - seemingly popping in and out of existence.

So in summary I wouldn't think of this in terms of 'beyond', but rather the 'next level up'. I hope that makes sense!
Well, just a few days ago I had made a comment on another post, related to this topic. 

I'll go ahead and add a few parts from it below, as it might be a bit helpful in this discussion, perhaps: 

--------------------------------

1) INFINITE UNIVERSE 

There are some who believe the current Universe is infinite in size, and that our big bang was just a "local inflation event" within that greater infinite spanning Universe.

That means a lot of stuff has happened in other parts of this infinite universe before our little inflation event. An infinity of time/events has happened before us! 

According to mathematical-probability, essentially whatever you can imagine happening in a Universe, has indeed happened before (including copies of your self existing in those far-distant parts!).

--------------------------------

2) MULTI-VERSE + BUBBLE UNIVERSES

Others say that our big bang, created our isolated "little" Universe bubble, within a vast sea known as the "multi-verse" that is seething constantly with other bubble universes popping in and out of existence constantly.

If so, then it's possible the fabric of the greater multi-verse has it's own isolated space-time dimensions, that are separate from our own bubble-universe's space-time dimensions.

So... essentially you've got an entirely separate and different space-time, existing outside of our Universe's space-time, which also gives rise to countless other Universes. 

--------------------------------

3) WE'RE LIVING INSIDE A BLACK HOLE! (?)

Still others... say that our current observable Universe is the "bottom" or the "interior" of a black hole, and that the "big bang" was the moment the black hole was created.

This means there is now a wall, isolating us from the rest of the Universe (since we can't see outside the event horizon of the black hole that we are stuck inside of, and they can't see us).

If true, that thus means we have our own space-time, and the main part of the universe has it's own space-time unfolding. That makes us a kind of branching space-time (or sub-universe), moving down a different and unique temporal pathway from the main space-time.

--------------------------------

IN SHORT... 

So ya... these are just SOME of the fascinating (and somewhat SciFi sounding!) plausible theories about what may lie outside of the known Universe.

And of course, the question you ask will never-ever be fully answered. 

For example, if we find proof that the bubble inducing "multi-verse" lies outside of our Universe, then you may ask, "What is beyond the multi-verse"... 

And if we then go further and discover that something called XYZ lies beyond the multi-verse, then you will ask, "What lies beyond XYZ?!"... and so on, and so on... 

In other words it's, "turtles all the way down!". 

But yes... still it's a fascinating question you ask, and pondering that question leads to new possible insights into physics, even if it will be a never-ending fractal kind of question, that is never fully answered. 

This question has always interested me. Literally anything could be beyond the universe! The universe could just be an electron zooming around a Hydrogen atom bound to 2 Oxygen in the tear of a crying baby in another dimension. It blows my mind.
Don't think of it as beyond. Consider all the inbound photons. Some photons come from things we can see. Then there are photons from the CMB. But there are zero photons coming from farther away.    

Zero. Not a single inbound photon has ever arrived from father away or farther back in time if you prefer. 

There's a reason why we call it the known universe. We don't know what's outside of it.
Nobody knows what is beyond the known universe. "Beyond" might not even make sense in this case, as far as we know. There could be a multiverse with multitudes of "bubble" universes of vastly diverse configurations springing into and ending existence all the "time", for the lack of a better word.

Sadly, he forgot one thing. There is almost ALWAYS a central, rebound cone in impacts. Those on the moon show the most of those, too.

Where's that here?
That would have been quite amazing to behold from within the valley inbetween circular mountain ranges.
Why shouldn't NASA do climate change? This is just a red herring to cut climate change funding. If people wanted to reorganize climate change research, they would say that. They would explain how all of NASA's climate change efforts are going to be moved over into NOAA, complete with the bureaucrats and scientists who run those programs, with budgets unchanged.

But that's not what they're saying.

If they really wanted to boost manned space exploration, they could just announce they're increasing NASA's manned space budget. There's no need to mention climate science, it's not like NASA can't walk and chew gum at the same time.

But they're not saying that either.

What they intend to do is to cut climate science to make brownie points with their voters, and to use the ruse of focusing on space exploration as bait for the gullible.
1) Its not like the NASA Earth Science is a thing on wheels that you can just roll down the street to NOAA. It is an organization of people that work at places like Goddard Space Flight Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Where would those people work now? What empty NOAA facilities are available complete with all of the the laboratories and IT infrastructure? 

2) Earth science and planetary scientists learn from each other. Many scientists work on both types of missions. Technologies that are developed for Earth science often end up on planetary science missions and vice versa. You gain economies of scale by leaving them together.

3) NOAA simply doesn't have the technical workforce to develop new remote sensing technologies. NASA does. So lets say you leave the engineers at NASA, rip out all the scientists and move them over to NOAA, wait a few years for them to rebuild their labs and for the dust to settle. Now what? You've broken the link between engineers and scientists, who were previously working closely together under the NASA roof. 

4) They aren't going to shift funds to NOAA. That is a smokescreen. They want to cut climate science budgets at NASA, NOAA, NSF, and DOE.  The GOP wants to gut NASA Earth Science the most because NASA is a trusted "name brand" when it comes to scientific results. 
Lmao, did you know that NOAA gets a TON of its data from NASA?

Did you know that the challenges solved for spaceflight programs have been directly and indirectly causal of Earth sciences advancements (not to mention giant economic returns)?

Did you know that "if we put 100% of our resources towards space" is nonsense as NASA uses SPACECRAFT for climate science research? Or that NASA gets less than **one half of one percent** of the US budget? If we **actually** put all our resources towards expanding the space frontier, we simply couldn't, because our education system has faltered and there are not enough engineers on Earth to actually make use of '100% of our resources for space'.
When the other side is full of neonazis, giving the nazi salute, saying hail Trump and spray painting swastikas on everything, I find it impossible to listen to anything they say and believe they the best intentions for the good of all mankind. 
The very very last thing NASA needs is to become even more politicized. 

There is already a serious problem with major, long term projects at NASA - they tend to get cancelled when administrations change. They're already talking about throwing out the work done on SLS and starting over - there is no way Trump's announced plans for NASA don't make this even worse. Starting from scratch every 4/8 years will ensure NASA never goes anywhere.
Sorry, but the glass is now being poured out onto the drought-stricken ground! How much Space Exploration can we accomplish before climate change decimates civilization? Stupid, stupid, stupid, plan by the greatest, smartest, smartest ( so He says) greatest business man in History. God Help Us, cause Trump looks like he's intent on destroying it all.
So N.A.S.A. becomes American **Space** Agency

Let the UN or Europe pick up the aeronautics and weather research.

It's also only a 1/3 reduction in budget.  2.8B to 2B

It's time to Un-PROXMIRE the **space** program.
Get ready for the copycat posts folks: both missions tweet these out daily. None of us realized a screencap of one of those tweets was worth 7k karma.
Wouldn't it be cool if you could ring a phone number and get a recorded message saying how far away voyager is.
Which updates automatically 
"At the tone the voyager probe will be 16 "light hours from earth"
I could envision a mission in some future date to bring back Voyager for historical purposes...  like for a museum.  

By that point the ship would have long lost it's power,  and other ships that greatly exceeded it's speed would have passed it in distance.

Not in my lifetime I guess, but one day perhaps.


Wow that was fast!  Just saw an article 5 minutes ago that said it was 15 hrs and 45 minutes away in light speed time.  Must have teleported or broke the laws of physics.
The people who care about what it really is are interested in the facts, not wild speculation. The people who care about wild speculation are not the kinds of people you want running a PR campaign to get young people enthusiastic about space.

There is a mystery, yes. But making the *assumption* that the odd data indicates a dyson sphere, or any similar arrangement, is incredibly *damaging*, as it conveys the idea that scientists make wild assumptions. And they do not.

Besides which, there is already a massive and effective PR campaign to get people interested in real space and real science; the highly successful video "7 Minutes of Terror" springs to mind. The problem here is that we, as a culture, do not encourage this sort of thing; culturally, we're more focused on gossip and fashion and sound-bites. There has been a lot of good effort in that area; Mythbusters, for example. But there is a long way to go, and the effort needs to be sustained. Re-naming things is not going to help. Plus, even if we do, what are we going to call it? ... a Bieber Sphere? Yeah, terrifying, I know.

And finally, a quick google search informs me that KIC 8462852 already *has* a nickname: Tabby's Star. Which you can find here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852
Garbage names are confusing and can lead to mistakes.  Just like in chemistry, there are common names that sometimes can be mistaken for other things, and there are the IUPAC accepted names that are exacting and unmistakable.
We tried that. We tried naming asteroids after mythological figures as we discovered them. We ran out of names long before we ran out of objects. The Minor Planet Center has a database of 1.3 million objects. Even when they cut it down to the ones we can calculate and orbit for and find again there are still 750,000. It is pointless to assign a name to something before you know its of value but you still need to be able to refer to it so it gets a scientific designation. Later if we decide they are of interest [we are going back and naming](http://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_exoplanets/) select ones.
"thought it was a meteorite, it wasn't"

uh, then what the fuck is it?
That's the contrail of a jet being illuminated by the sun.  It looks super bright because his camera is adjusted for the darkness.
Now wait a second, I thought that natural occurring events can't possibly coincide with each other!
It's an airplane illuminated by the sun from below the horizon. You can see it pretty much every day shortly before sunrise and after sunset. Case closed.
It doesn't look like a meteor to me, looks like it's moving far too slow to be that. Probably the contrail from a plane 
Isn't it considered a meteor until there is a fragment on the ground that you would call a meteorite? Or do I have this wrong.
Why does it look like it's going against gravity? And why is it moving so slow?
Whoa a video where the person filming isnt a fumbling shaking mess and keeps the camera centered on the object.
I have seen thousands of meteorites in my life, never one this slow.

Space junk entering the atmosphere?
The actual contruction is done my technicians under the supervision of an engineer who's job it is to make sure construction goes smoothly and according to plan.  A design engineer will never touch a bolt or tool. The supervising engineer for the build might.
Everybody that goes to engineering school thinks they will be a designer. The Designer, in any field, is an extremely competitive and limited employment area. The Design Engineer is like the NFL Quarterback.  Boeing usually has a principal PhD Senior Systems Engineer that maintains the overall envelope of the design, determining specification requirements, staying up with the latest technology to incorporate for performance gain and increasing profit. The actual initiator for the design is the market. This link is a pretty good read about the process that ended with the production 787, one engineer working his way up as a wing design expert.  
  
http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/how-boeing-put-the-dream-in-dreamliner-20968765/  
  
The reality is design engineers are like rock stars and most other engineers stay garage bands their whole career. In rocketry, the engines were for missiles first, and it was about machining on a gigantic scale. There still is a lot of gigantic machining and welding going on but it is a lot more automated now. Everything is designed CAD/CAM these days so there are far fewer mock-ups and prototypes. FEM analysis decreases the need for physical destructive testing. The components and subassemblies come from all over, specialized little machine shops making connectors, wiring harnesses, tubing, fittings, etc. In the space industry, there are always assembly areas. In most cases, separate components are assembled in different parts of the country or world, then the components are brought together at the main assembly area, the big building the rocket wheels out of before launch.
Once the engineers design it, some factory somewhere probably produces everything. However, where there is a factory, there are engineers.

Designing spacecraft solves engineering problems similar to designing jet planes because rocket science comes down to designing powerful fuel pumps (and vessels) that withstand high pressure/temperature differences while pumping liquid fuel into a combustion chamber. it gets trickier with supersonic speeds due to much more vibrations beyond the sound barrier. newtonian physics of orbital transits is relatively simple compared to that.

Spacecraft manuffacturing is usually owned by companies who manufacture jet planes.
Spacecraft usually are worth investing in refining higher grade aluminum and cleaner environments.

Other problems come with conensation and freezing of stored liquids in 0g environments. this is complex and still being researched a lot. It is easier do do for a few weeks on a trip to the moon and harder to maintain for years in low earth orbit. It can cause real problems when storing Water, Oxygen, fuel for life support.

Another easily missable issue in space is cooling. low density of space means you can cool something by emmitting infrared, as you can not transfer much heat by condensation. This means, to cool a space station in orbit, you need nearly as much surface for cooling as you need for solar panels.
How does the faster the ring rotate equate to the more massive the ring is? 

If the structure was rotating near luminal speeds, it would increase in mass, but the centrifugal forces would surely rip it apart. Moreover, that increase in mass, doesn't equate to an increase in matter, so I don't understand how you think that star would be dimmed more by a faster spinning Dyson ring.
as long as no rovers named the [Edmund Fitzgerald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vST6hVRj2A) try to cross, it should be OK

To think that I am looking at the landscape of a planet that is barely a speck in the night sky...amazing.
Cut from this [Original Image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/136797589@N04/31070007806/sizes/h/) that was pieced together by a Gentleman named Sean over at [UnmannedSpaceFlight](http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?showtopic=8197&st=705&start=705)
Given the title. I kept waiting to see a Rover cross the screen. Then I realized it's not a gif.
It's going to be epic once humans get to mars. Although the secession wars won't be all that awesome.
I always wonder, when I look at pictures like these on Mars, if we're looking at the real thing or some good art. I know it sounds stupid, but it's so amazing I can't believe we're really looking at the surface of this planet,
this is what a new crater looks like, it was created between 2010 and 2012, photo by the MRO.

The crater spans approximately 30m (100 ft) in diameter and is surrounded by a large, rayed blast zone. Because the terrain where the crater formed is dusty, the fresh crater appears blue in the enhanced colour of the image, due to removal of the reddish dust in that area. Debris tossed outward during the formation of the crater is called ejecta. In examining ejecta's distribution, scientists can learn more about the impact event. The explosion that excavated this crater threw ejecta as far as 15Km (9.3 miles)

[source](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=pia17932) 
NASA has named the crater, "John." That's right, it's John Crater of Mars.
Seeing this reminds me of the time I visited Barringer Crater in Arizona. As you're driving across miles of desert on the road to the crater, there's not much to look at, but eventually you see the rim of this massive crater rising out of the desert floor. It's a pretty awesome spectacle to see... standing on one edge and looking almost 3/4 of a mile toward the other side, and down about 40 stories (500') to the bottom. The most interesting thing to me, after learning more about the meteor, the impact, and the crater, was the drive back out... where before, I saw a barren, bleak, and totally uninteresting dessert, I now saw the huge boulders, undulating ground, and debris field from the ejecta, spreading out for miles and miles along that road back to the highway.

http://ottawa-rasc.ca/wiki/images/thumb/9/9f/Barringer_ejecta_IR.jpg/400px-Barringer_ejecta_IR.jpg
Pretty cool picture.  It would be nice to see the picture in natural colors, not enhanced.  I wonder how many people think that if they were on mars this is what they would see.
from what i understand, mars has a weaker... atmosphere than earth? wouldnt things like meteors be a larger problem than on earth? would that impact the colonization of mars at all?
Could material from the surface of Mars be launched into space from this sized impact?
How frequent are these? Will it pose at actual risk for the first visitors?
So with atmosphere, drag, etc, etc, what would a 100 ft impact do to a major city and the surrounding areas.  Examples please while I go build my bunker.

I wonder if we'll get to see it at surface level in our lifetime, either with a rover, or with humans!
Didn't see if this has been covered already but is there a way to determine how big the object was before it hit the surface?
Could the negative space between the ejecta lines tell us something about the composition of the impact object?
What does "fresh" mean?  How old is this crater?  Hours?  Days? Months?   Or is it untold thousands of years old, but geologically fresh?

Second, If it is fresh (in terms of days to months old), how far away are Opportunity and Curiosity?  Could they get there before a lot of the volatiles blew away?
Pretty sure that's a Mr Meeseeks that was unsuccessful for too long.
Just the universe crash landing it's life raft down on a new planet here, guys. Nothing to see, move along.
Quick thought maybe someone can help me out with this. If this just happened recently and other planets are getting hit Like this I'm assuming, how come earth hasn't?  I've always wondered this but probably missed why it doesn't happen. 
Must be that European space probe that *didn't* *quite* *make* *it*
So that's something that our mars colony will have to deal with, unlike they would have to on Earth.  Kind of terrifying actually.
It's kind of odd to think that we know the surface of mars better than we know the floors of our oceans

When you zoom in at the earth, there is another feint dot. Is that the moon?

I had to clean my screen to get rid of the dust specks so I could clearly make out earth
Source: http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17936
The original image is black and white (http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17936 ) and the one posted is blue. Is it an artist colorization or is the blue tone close to what we would see with human eyes at this specific time (after sunset)?
"Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives...on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam." - Carl Sagan




That's cool, but they should wait until the time of year when Super Earth comes around.
My cuestión: where are all the stars? They cant be seen from mars? If so, why we can see the earth??
When I see pictures of the earth from "outside", I always think of Carl Sagan's speech:  
  
We succeeded in taking that picture, and, if you look at it, you see a dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there – on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.

[...] To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known. — Carl Sagan, speech at Cornell University, October 13, 1994

Here's a dumb question. Is the earth easier to spot from mars now than it was 100 years ago due to all the lights in it surface?
So... if your planet died, or you killed it, and could see another planet close enough that you might be saved, and you had sufficient technology to pull off interplanetary flight... would you do it?
So...is no one else going to ask why this image is blue? The original is black-and-white, where is this color information coming from?
Every human being, flower, blade of grass, piece of sand, fish, whale, boat, argument, car, rollerblade, sushi restaurant, riot, cucumber, whole foods, guitar, blowjob, helicopter, shoe lace, bento box, dental floss, sheep dog, shitty movie, elbow drop, Kanye West rant, mass extinction, religion, gnats, etc.

All that shit is in that tiny fucking speck of light. 
**Wallpaper without the blue filter** : [Imgur Link](http://i.imgur.com/r0VCRil.jpg)

It's been my wallpaper for months. I don't like the filter. When you look at the original, you can really picture you there. You almost feel the solitude and silence of it.
Is there a way to order a professional print of this or the similar sunset on Mars one?
Imagine you came to Mars, didn't like it there.

You're looking into the sky and think "the next SpaceX ITS is in 2 years"...
This makes me wonder what Phobos and Deimos look like from the surface of Mars. 
I can see my house from here! 

And my friend's house!

And all of human history!

I see a little dot in a photo and if I never read the caption I would never have spottet that dot but still I feel intensely homesick when looking at it
I opened up this picture as was like, "Where's Earth?" I saw a bunch of white specks that I thought were stars and was trying to figure out which one of them could be Earth.

I scrolled down to get a full view of the picture and the specks moved with it.


The specks were dust on my monitor. FML.

Sagan was a poet beyond his years. 
Right. I can't see the Earth *and* there's a dead pixel on my screen.
I imagine NASA when taking the photo: "wave your hand by the window to see if its us!"
why we can't see the same sky with thousand of stars as in earth? why there aren't stars in that view?
Horizon prominently visible in this, background illumination clearly marking outlines and collectively giving a broader vision about the infinite span of the universe.
Beautiful, reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgBZg74JUyo).
Is the filter to make it look closer to true colour or is it to make it pretty?
The specs of dust on my screen make it look like stars across the picture. 
I Love dark backgrounds and i just set this as my wallpaper it looks sooo good! Thanks to whoever the credits go to!
You, me, everyone you've ever known, seen, or will know, all exists on that pale blue speck.
Why is the athmosphere blue? I thought it was like that on earth because of the oxygen.
If that doesn't put your problems into perspective I don't know what will.
Woah totally changed my perspective on how dirty my screen is, this was like a where's waldo of tiny grey specks 
Is the atmosphere really that blue, or is it taken in some sort of false color?
The first humans to land on Mars will look back at the earth and go into a panic attack asking themselves what have they done!
Just the fact that we are able to do this is astonishing to me.  This also makes me believe that we are so insignificant to the whole picture its unbelievable.
space cops, here come space cops. space. trial. On trial! GUILTY...of being in space! GO TO SPACE JAIL!"
That's friken right, we're insignificant!! 
And people still don't believe in aliens
It would be incredibly surreal to look through a telescope and see Earth.
I had to basically play "find the dot" with my phone screen since it's covered in dirt.
All of the world's problems in that tiny little spec, damn that is just mind boggling. 
I would think that because there is no light pollution that you would be able to see WAY more stars. Why does the sky look so barren? 
It fucks me up knowing that I very well may have been at work flipping patties when this was taken.
Somewhere, in that tiny speck of bright pixels...

Is a guy getting a blowjob. Let that sink in.
It bothers and amazes me simultaneously that I am technically in this photograph.
Wow! I think this is my favourite space image ever. It reeks of loneliness(that's not why it's my favourite, btdubs). I already realise how insignificant we probably are but this really drives it home. 

It also makes me feel sorry for those poor lonely rovers. I like to think that they're all programmed to meet up once in a while. 
Why is the picture blue? I thought the blue on earth was caused by high amounts of nitrogen? Is it the same on Mars?
why do we see earth eye naked but no stars?

With the right angle between sun/mars/earth, can we see mars as a little dot as well? Isn't it hidden between all the more visible stars
I'm always amused by these posts, could be anything really. No other information is given, it's just a dot in the sky. Could be anything at all. 
This reminds me of Space Balls when Lonestar shows Vespa Druidia in the desert. 
Absolutely amazing. I'm sure many of us are astronomers. Imagine the feeling of using your scope to look at a tiny Earth and moon against the blackness of space. :)
This makes me think of The Martian Chronicles and what Bradbury must have imagined when he wrote about Earth under nuclear war. 
I can understand why the loneliness has the potential to drive an astronaut crazy. Being that far from home, with one way back that might take months and months. Pretty scary. 
I had a bunch of white fluff on my screen when I saw this so my first reaction was "which one is it?"

Does anyone know why bodies look so small at high noon and then so large at the horizon? 
Looks rather unassuming like other objects in the sky, but we know how much beauty and life it holds. I wonder how many millions of planets host beauty of similar magnitude throughout the universe. 
You know I always liked the books from Burroughs and I even enjoyed, it seems like I am the only one, the movie adaption of the first book. In the movie they depicted the Earth and moon to be much closer and easily seen like we can see the moon from the earth. I always knew that in actually it would be like seeing Mars as a bright star but to have a little bit of movie magic make it a little more fantasy was cool. 

I just hate the fact that I was born to late that I could not explore the last places of Earth and too soon that I can not explore the galaxy.


Is there a picture of Jupiter from Mars? I bet it's pretty damn bright.
I had to wipe the dust particles off my screen to see the right dot :P.
It will be a wonderful day when Mars has its own telescope that people look up into the night sky with, and see Earth, humanity's home planet. :)
This reminds me of "The pale blue dot" by Carl Sagan

That dot is all of us, all humanity, all the stories, the good, the bad
Everything happened on that dot.
No matter what planet you look at earth from, it's a pale blue dot. 
It'd be cool if we had a ring.  Can we make an artificial one at some point?  
WELL... I've, yet again sat here for a few minutes realizing every complaint I've ever had was minuscule.
We humans think we're so high and mighty with our "technology" and "civilization". This is a sombre reminder that we are a little fish in a very, very big pond.
So why can you see Earth from Mars and you can tell it's a planet but from Earth looking at Mars it looks like a star?
This picture made realize how dusty my monitor was. There were many "earths" on my screen.
How long does light take to travel from Earth to Mars? Looking up at the stars, you know you're seeing light from billions of year ago. Looking at the Earth from Mars, or Mars from Earth, how old is that light? 
As an aspiring photographer and lover of science and exploration pictures like this make me want to go to Mars just to be one of the first Martian photographers.
This boggles my mind! How many times have I stood outside at night looking up at the red glowing "star" of Mars, and here I am looking at Earth from Mars! 

Also, I kind of expected Earth to have a bluer glow... 
Doesn't Mars appear bigger and clearer to see with the naked eye from Earth than the other way around, going by this picture? 
I always love seeing photos from Mars and other planets because HOLY CRAP THAT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PLANET. It's so wondrous and awe-inspiring.
I thought Earth would be almost as bright from Mars as Venus is from Earth since it's still pretty close to the sun.
Pretty mind blowing to think in that pale dot are billions of people doing people things.  being born, dying, fucking, fighting, having epiphanies, doing drugs, wondering what's for dinner, shuffling along in their daily routines.
I wonder if any of the photons that bounced off me are in this picture 
I allways love to Imangine that their is civilization on mars and we both knew about it for hundreds of years.
At first, I was staring in awe at a small dot in the center of the photo. Then I realized it was a piece of dust on my monitor. There's not much of a difference.
I can see my house!!!  ...  

Oh yea thats because I am in my house
Thought it was a speck of dirt on my phone. *Zoom in* "Oh shit yep there it is." 
I'm wondering why there aren't more stars in the sky... I imagine there is zero light pollution there so they should be clearly visible can someone explain that?
Why aren't there any stars visible? If the answer is just reflected/ambient light interference I'll be disappointed 
As I look at that tiny bright spec realizing thats where  Ive been my entire life, I wonder what exactly I was doing at that exact moment.
Is the highest definition we have of this image the picture in the link?
Stupid question:
Is that the real color of dusk/dawn sky on Mars? This pic is as profound as Pale Blue Dot to me.
"Dust, dust, dust, cat hair, dust... is that it? no,... dust, smudge, dust, wait... -.- oh, there it is."
To me the most mindblowing thing about all this space stuff is that how do they manage to get HD photos from a tiny robot from another planet millions of kilometers away?
Damn! This gives me amazing chills and makes my eyes Water a little. Makes you think allot about the madness that is going on here on earth compared to the silent blue of this this mars photo.
There is no way I'll ever see a man walking down there :(

My children will...
I can see the Earth in this picture also its a shade of blue?

Im on mobile, so it could be that.
This image gives me further appreciation of the Voyager 1 "Pale Blue Dot". The difference in distance between the two is staggering and from Mars we seem like a pale dot. I understand the cameras used were much different and using long exposures and slewing made PBD possible. 
Obligatory [Pale Blue Dot reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PN5JJDh78I)
As men born to the earth, we dream of visiting the stars.

As men born to the stars, we will dream, of returning home.
We're just a little dot on the surface of that frozen rock's sky. That really puts things into perspective. I'm more thankful for everything in my life after seeing something like this. wow. 
From this point of view how could anyone not expect life on other planets
Yup and to think we're killing that tiny little planet and wont have anyone to look at it once we completely **** it up with global warming :)
Life on Earth is stupid, they have been teaching it to us for years. It's just a stupid blue spot, nothing else, some say they have canals or oceans haha, how can you have blue oceans when Mars is red.

I think the Earthans will attack us... we should prepare.

LOOK LOOK....... An Earthian Probe!

RUN.. RUN........
Imagine the religions that could have evolved from this being your night sky, with a point of light that has another that closely follows and circles it.  And I wonder how much faster people would have figured out gravitation.
I'm glad my monitor is 4K. The moon is quite clear once you zoom in.

It's also amazing to know that all the planets can fit between the earth and moon. How freaking tiny are we?
Where does the glow near the horizon come from? On earth, that's usually the atmosphere. Dust? Zodiacal light?
Someone make a writing prompt for a thousand year old human martian colony thats somehow lost contact with earth, but still has an oral tradition of telling stories of the old world, the tiny blue dot in the sky.
Martian:  No life there, its too wet.  Who could live with all that water... and Carbon!!!... my supreme being, all these crazy people and their tails of earthlings.  That thing over there?  Weather balloon... with wheels.
I feel small. It reminds me of that comic strip about the rover being all alone and it makes cry. 
Kinda like most people in my city's dreams, dark with 100% chance of lack of Earth relevance 
After seeing many "false" earths... I understand that I really need to clean my screen
Fucking mind blowing, imagine if you were on Mars now, as if a copy of Earth but neither planet had established means to take a closer look at eachother. 

You look up and that tiny tiny dot in space. Such an insignificant little thing, like any other dot visible, you may pause and wonder what's there or you may brush it off along with the countless other dots in your view. 

Yet on that tiny tiny dot, holds untold billions of triumphs, moments of happiness and sadness, of victory and defeat, of research and slander, of progress and atrocity, of peace and war and of love and hate, yet all this seems impossible when that dot is one among untold billions. 

Imagine all the dots you've looked upon when you look into the night sky, completely unaware of the events that took place there. 
It's awesome how they timed the photo to capture the flat side like that. You'd probably have a hard time seeing it at all if you were looking at the earth's edge. 
Always hated sciences, hence, the reason i study law. But man this sub makes me want to research and want to know more about space/physics-related subjects whilst doing my legal assignments :')
Why is the Earth (and the Moon) the only thing you can see in the sky?  Where are all the stars and other planets?
Makes me realize how pointless we all are, in the best way possible.
This is honestly really humbling. It shows that in the cosmos, we are only a speck of dust.
There's zero light pollution on Mars. Why isn't the sky absolutely full of stars?
Does not really rain diamonds on neptune, that's just an an artifact of searching for rain on the neptune wiki page, Deep in a sea of methane at high pressure, methane CH4 May reduce to Diamonds C and hydrogen H. But we are talking about Molecular sized diamonds ""raining"" down inside a superionic liquid methane at 7000km depth 
It snows a little bit every now and then on Mars, just the lightest of flurries though
Just thinking about this makes me sad. Looking out into space we can see the desolate and barren rocky planets that fill our solar system. We then look to our own planet and fail to see the beauty and magnificence of it all. Instead we go about our daily lives while slowly bleeding our beautiful planet dry of it's resources and diversity in the name of money and power 

The moon must look upon us like a lonely depressed parent looks at their child who is heading down the wrong path and who knows that one day their child will end up just like them

All that empty space on Mars makes me not envy the poor fools that will get sent over there.
It's ALOT harder then just chaining slingshot, that would take double the time, don't you think that they are working on something by now since Juno? 
We've done chained gravity assists already with the Cassini mission. It did 4 fly-by's: 2 at Venus, 1 at Earth and 1 at Jupiter. From what I'm seeing, its top speed was 44km/s.
40km/s or 80km/s or 200km/s is not fast enough for there to be any difference between them in "consequences and problems".
Here ya go:

Looks like 200kW of power from the reactor.

And I think the total mass was between 26,681kg and 35,102kg.

Am I the only one who think a giant zamboni is in order? Solar system's largest ice ring!!!
Image Credit: NASA, Johns Hopkins U./APL, Southwest Research Inst. Explanation: Is there an ocean below Sputnik Planum on Pluto? The unusually smooth 1000-km wide golden expanse, visible in the featured image from New Horizons, appears segmented into convection cells. But how was this region created? One hypothesis now holds the answer to be a great impact that stirred up an underground ocean of salt water roughly 100-kilometers thick. The featured image of Sputnik Planum, part of the larger heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio, was taken last July and shows true details in exaggerated colors. Although the robotic New Horizons spacecraft is off on a new adventure, continued computer-modeling of this surprising surface feature on Pluto is likely to lead to more refined speculations about what lies beneath.
I must admit I'm still expecting to be disappointed, but this is probably the farthest I've seen one of these ostensibly propellantless propulsion systems come.
God I hope this thing really works. I know it probably doesn't, but to see reactionless drive look this plausible makes me think maybe someday I *will* get to own and operate my own spacecraft.

The "related links" at the bottom were disappointing, though. They all had a picture of an ion thruster representing the EmDrive. I guess ion thrusters look cooler.
We're coming to an age where we may not be born too soon to explore the universe... in fact we may be the first generation to explore the solar system (and beyond?)
"For example, “the gravitational constant can be shown to be a long wavelength consequence of the quantum vacuum rather than a fundamental constant,” which suggests that gravitation itself could emerge from quantum vacuum physics."

This blew my mind. I know it may not be true but the concept really got me thinking.
Voyager is probably the best example right now. It's power is slowly decaying, and more and more instruments have been turned off. Eventually there will be only enough power to run the transmitter (so it can ping us) and then after that it will go dead.

There are two limitations on the power output of an RTG, both related to mass. First, the most efficient sources are from isotopes that don't occur naturally, thus they have to be synthesized in nuclear reactors -- a long and expensive process. Second,  while a larger (more massive) RTG will produce more power, it is also quite a bit more costly to launch.
Any isotope such a system would use is limited by its half-life, so the power output decreases over time; furthermore, the thermocouple system also degrades. At launch the three RTGs produced 470 W; as of October 2011 they produced 267.9 W and 269.2 W.

Increasing power output requires more fuel (which is heavier), more radioactive fuel (that won't last as long), or a Sterling cycle turbine or other type of more efficient generator (NASA's budget for which got axed).

There is no theoretical limit. We could launch a probe powered by decaying uranium, which would last for *billions* of years, but powering the Voyager would take *thousands of tons*, because unsurprisingly, energy output is reverse-proportional to isotope half-life. So there are practical limits of a few decades, which are stretched thanks to continuously disabling more and more systems of the spacecraft.
These space probes are powered by Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators.  These have a lump of a radioactive material in them that produces heat as it decays.  This heat is turned into electricity by thermocouples.

Because the fuel decays, the power output of the RTG decreases over time.  For example, the RTGs on the Voyager probes produced 16.6% less power after 23 years than they did when the probes were launched.  The material the thrermocouples are made of will also degrade over time, gradually reducing their ability to convert the decay heat into electricity.

I can't find any info on RTGs capable of being "refueled", as the fuel is solid and the RTG is sealed (basically welded shut) when it's built.  However, NASA is working on developing new RTGs which use different materials for the thermocouples that won't degrade as fast, leading to the RTG as a whole potentially having a long enough practical lifespan to be reused for multiple missions.

(source:  mainly [the Wikipedia page on RTGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator).)
It sounds like NASA or others should get back to the Sterling engine; should the EM drive pan out, we'll need a lot more power than RTGs can generate.
>Scientists examined part of Mars' Utopia Planitia region, in the mid-northern latitudes, with the orbiter's ground-penetrating Shallow Radar (SHARAD) instrument. Analyses of data from more than 600 overhead passes revealed a deposit more extensive in area than the state of New Mexico. The deposit ranges in thickness from about 260 feet to about 560 feet, with a composition that's 50 to 85 percent water ice, mixed with dust or larger rocky particles.


Could be our new home on mars. Burrow into it. Get shielding from radiation, water, fuel, hydrogen, oxygen. As you burrow you get more water, fuel, hydrogen and oxygen. Bring a sealable door from home and something to melt the ice with. Back to the ice caves.
The white flecks, is that radiation? Or is it ice crystals refracting the light?
I don't feel that this even remotely qualifies as "the greatest photo ever taken off planet" - that is an awfully high bar. That being said (and speaking as a Star Trek fan going back a half century as well as one who has been using the ISS for a science project), it is a cool pic of ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti on the ISS.
Nope. While I love everything about this picture, I would say The Pale Blue Dot is, by far, much more meaningful and impactful.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot
idk why but this is still my favorite picture taken in space. 
 
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Neil_Armstrong_2.jpg
It's a nerdy joke from Samantha: the thing she's pointing at is a Dragon bringing coffee for the [ISSpresso experiment](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1769.html).



So, there was coffee in that Dragon: https://twitter.com/astrosamantha/status/589035429879513088



She was enacting this classic quote: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSuXtHpjI2s from Star Trek: Voyager.


Sorry but no.

This isn't even [the greatest photo of a female astronaut taken in the ISS' Cupola](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tracy_Caldwell_Dyson_in_Cupola_ISS.jpg) much less the "greatest photo ever taken off-planet"
Cause it's European astronaut in Europe-built module pointing at a Canadian arm and a Private spacecraft on US mission, in space over the ocean? I don't get why it's suppose to be *the greatest photo*... 

Pale blue dot, or Earthrise or Blue Marble, or Tracy Dyson's cupola photo, or even a tribute to Spock are a strong candidates to take it over ;) Really, there's been so many more memorable and amazing photos taken "off-planet" that I would struggle to pick one, but I doubt this one here would make it top-10 - that's how outstanding competition there is.
I thought the person was dressed as a Star Trek character and that was why it was on here. What's great about this?
We have photos of Pluto in amazing detail and this is the greatest photo off planet?????
Was I the only person who thought that she wasn't going to make it very much longer...she's a red shirt!!
ESA Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti.

There are some amazing videos she's in on YouTube

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPUvzn3CTQc
HOLY SHIT guys OP is just saying it's cool. "This might be the best [insert whatever here]" is a catchy way of saying this is really great and caught my attention. It's a figure of speech. They're not saying it's literally better than any other picture in space. Calm down guys, why is everyone so on edge about opinions anyways?
As a Canadian ... the greatest space person/photo/video is Chris Hadfield. BUT let's not forget; Marc Garneau, Roberta Bondar, Julie Payette, Bjarni Tryggvason, David Saint-Jacques, Jeremy Hansen, Robert Thirsk, Steve MacLean, and everyone else in the Canadian Space Program that I have failed to mention ... "standing on the shoulders of (the greatest) humans.
My favorite photo. First untethered space walk:

http://m.imgur.com/BJdo53x?r

Can you imagine what that must have been like? The isolation and high stakes really show through that photo. 
Why is that? What is the significance of this photo? I just see someone pointing out a window at the Earth with their thumb.
Until Q shows up and makes the earth disappear just for shit and giggles.
I'm watching Voyager right now, so it actually took me a second to notice why this is awesome.
Is it just me or was this an extremely effective title that carried its content?
While a great picture I personally think the greatest picture ever taken in space is this one. 
http://www.funnyjunk.com/Most+of+humanity+in+one+picture/funny-pictures/5222661#3c6e5d_5222217
I love how angry everyone got like someone just shot their dog. You people need to chill. 
Actually, it IS the coolest picture I've ever seen taken from space.  And that is because I've been fascinated with space since I was a child BECAUSE of Star Trek. Everyone below who's complaining are only seeing the "little" picture. The public's interest in something determines, to a large extent, the amount of funding it gets. A picture of a lunar crater doesn't stimulate anywhere near the passion that Star Trek does. 
I love this picture! She is talented, very smart, and wears a Starfleet Uniform on a Spacestation! 
I'll be honest, I though it was the greatest because of obvious Photoshop opportunities...
Space astounds me... they take selfies from downward angles looking up. It's crazy how no gravity does that. 
I'd give her 2 bars gold pressed Latium if she would be willing to be a 0g  spinner.
I'm looking forward to the skin tight unitards.

Pretty sure Troi was the reason I started puberty at like 11. 
I really dislike how this sub has been sliding toward default-sub mediocrity with its content and titles lately.
Cristoforetti (if that is indeed her real name) is about to get a visit from the Department of Temporal Investigations.

Woah. I wish I could go there to get a photo of myself as well. It would be an amazing experience too.
Not even slightly close. But yeah it's a pretty cool pic non the less. Though it may fall into the category of just another image taken on the space station.

If you stare at it for a couple seconds the planet seems like it's moving....
"Beam me over to THAT ship because they are experiencing a warp-core-melt-down", said Geordi.
I like this one:

https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/38/1f/ea/381fea24dd5efdd1b87ace54719f27c6.jpg

It's not a movie, it's real life. That's awesome.
Wait so is the spacecraft upside down or under the earth?? And can you even be upside down in space?
This is likely the most uninteresting photo from space I've ever seen.  I don't even get it.  Whats so special about a chick in her pajamas pointing out the window?






Well I'm confused because the woman who was on there before; her hair was sticking up all over the place...her hair is lovely and sorted....I doubt that's in space.
My uncle designed the module she is in! It's called the [Cupola Module](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupola_(ISS_module)) and is the biggest window/observatory on the station.
I can't help but think about how many ~~millions~~ thousands it must have cost NASA or the ESA just to bring that costume to space. I mean, how much do clothes weigh? 1 lbs? So it might have cost them $10,000 just to bring that costume there, just so they can enact a Star Trek joke.
Yes, much more impressive than the high def images from pluto, or from the surface of Mars, or of Jupiter. Because of the Star Trek uniform.
Is she trying to bring down the the station? She better be a responsible red shirt and get killed alone in the vacuum or something.
Bringing in another scifi series analogy (Babylon 5), I can see this as a "what was, what is, what will be". The ISS is the past, Dragon is the present, and the Star Trek reference is a future goal.
Love that of all the things an astronaut wants for living in space, this made the list. Still not the greatest photo off planet though. 
Why? Because it has a woman in it? 


You're fucking pathetic /u/anothersmeghead
Unless the photo was taken by an alien lifeform and she is giving it directions to Earth, it's not the greatest photo ever taken off-planet.  
I honestly don't even care if it's true, this is a wonderful story.
>Don’t believe a single word these people are telling you.

That [liar's paradox,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox) though.
[deleted]
Nice photo OP. Do you want to know a super easy way to deal with atmospheric distortion? 
Astronauts who have been in the shadow of the moon have said that the entire sky is filled with stars.
It would depend on where you were and what you were looking at but if you've ever been somewhere rural on a clear night with a dark skies by-law? It would look a lot like that but no star twinkling due to atmosphere
> Would it look like the amount of stars you can see when you're out in the middle of the wilderness?

It would look similar, but you'd be able to see even more stars, and they wouldn't twinkle.
Atmospheric extinction would not exist, so you would be able to see stars of the same brightness in every direction, and also you would be able to see down to another magnitude compared to even the darkest skies on Earth. (7.5-8 is the limit for expert observers on Earth under perfect skies, the limit in space could be 8.5-9). Planets would not look any different.
They've gotta be sending up duct tape , paperclips, rubberbands, and a bunch of other "junk drawer" stuff just to have on hand for unplanned situations right?
can someone explain the picture to me? slowly, as if you had already tried to do so ten times before.

Edit: thanks for teaching me about a cool episode in space engineering!
I have actually met a man who helped come up with that solution. The air purification system on the the ship involved chemical crystals that would scrub the air as it passed through, and this man worked for the company who provided those crystals. NASA reached out to them to see if they could offer any guidance and this guy came up with the solution. He has a trophy/award type thing from NASA to show for it. I can't remember his name, unfortunately, but he retired to a town outside of Charlotte, NC, and I met him a couple years ago while working in a previous job and we struck up a conversation and somehow landed on that topic.
Is there a schematic anywhere of what they actually built and how it fit?
We've gotta find a way to fit this, into the hole for THIS, using nothing but that. 
This is a great shot. What came to my eye unexpectedly was the STACKS of paper binded together in the background. I wonder how much was weight was used in paper logs & procedures??
...and that's how the centuries-old cubicle office phrase came about. 

"Bob, you don't have enough synergy, we need you to fit the square peg in the round hole more."
An intelligent overview of the claims, actual evidence, critical objections and possible explanations. I've read a few of these, and for once, the media have done a nice job
It's a good article. One thing I would like to mention is that it's possible to conform to Newton's third law without realizing it.

One example is hypothetical "field propulsion" drives. These are drives which push against quantum fields. For example, you can push/pull against a planet's magnetic field using a strong electromagnet. That particular example would be an electrodynamic tether, of which working devices have indeed been built. Field propulsion of more exotic varieties might interact with other quantum  fields, such as the Higgs field, but who knows if that's actually possible. Unless you knew to look for distortions in these quantum fields (and had the means to do so), you wouldn't know if your device was actually interacting with them or not.

By the way, I just propelled my rolling office chair across the room by repeatedly jerking forwards and backwards without expelling propellant. Did I just violate Newton's third law? Of course not. The point is, Newton's third law is much more flexible than most people think. You just need to push against something. In space that has traditionally required you spit something out your ass-end, because there's nothing obvious to push against, but since the universe is filled with quantum fields and there's no such thing as a perfect vacuum, that's not necessarily an absolute requirement.
My god this title

They are NOT claiming it works. They are claiming the methodology used to test the engine appears to be flawless
It doesn't not work... but it doesn't work  is what I got from this.

Exciting. 
It's amazing how well-shot photos from back in the day still look new. 
The photo is great, but look at this space ship on a launchpad FROM FUCKING 1969 ON ITS WAY TO THE MOON
That's a great photo and shows many cool details of the vehicle which are small but critically important to its operation. 

- The pressurization duct on the S-IC which fed gaseous oxygen to the top of the stage during flight, to pressurize the LOX tank

- The ullage motors on the S-II interstage

- The ducts that routed the hydrogen fuel for S-II around the LOX tank at its bottom

- The auxiliary propulsion system packages stuck way up on the sides of S-IVB

Edit: actually, as it turned out S-II ullage wasn't that critical: the J mission Apollos flew without those motors.

The Saturn was always my favorite rocket. I grew up with that bird.

The new stuff is cool, very cool, but the Saturn...it's just special.
Still, was avoiding all the flip-flopping at the launch pad worth the fuss of transporting this monster vertically?
When I think about how much math, physics and chemistry go into building something like that, my head nearly implodes.
Can someone say a cooler word for "I am gonna wallpaper this for my phone" 
"so, let me get this straight...you guys want me to strap that thing on my back and launch me where?!?!"
I get a weird sense of vertigo from looking up at tall, near by objects. This picture did it for me.
Reminds me of [the Aztec level](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/jamesbond/images/2/2f/N64_goldeneye_007_aztec_rocket_by_ampharosbiggestfan-d33hs5m.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20121207071656) from Goldeneye 007.
Whats that backpack looking thing on the rocket 3rd arm from the top ?

Edit: auxiliary propulsion system? Is this for seperation of the stages ?
Awesome, i was just wondering how they assembeled these last night.
Inspirational. Like the spire of a cathedral, the human spirit reaching for the stars.
Taken by a Samsung Galaxy Note 7.  The phone was then put inside the rocket for extra propulsion.
This looks so much like a 3D render to me. I'm even less convinced of its authenticity because of the lack of noise in the shadows and the flares and lack of shadow inside the shed look odd. Like, *nothing* is out of focus, even the furthest parts of the image. It just doesn't match the camera technology of the 60's. 

Either that or it has been retouched up the wahzoo more recently. 
Looked at Polaris at last night still 30 degrees above the horizon for me at 30 degrees latitude. If the Earth was titling off its 23.4 degree tilt Polaris wouldn't be at the pole. It would 2.0 degrees away and circling the pole. This would be blatantly noticeable by all astronomers amateur and professional since to take photos we align telescopes based on that tilt. We would all be screaming our heads off if this was happening. 

The tilt of the earth changes over thousands of years not 2. Nibiru is bunk.
The video includes such unscientific words as "extreme", "alarming", and "nibiru". This does not need our help in debunking.

A cute (pun: acute) case of [Pareidolia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LWrgH0nORE).
The Von Karman lectures in general are some of the best videos you can watch if you want to dive into the details of how space missions work and get detailed info on the science.  The Cassini mission videos are particularly good.
Until space travel reaches the point where traveling to Mars is as easy as traveling to the nearest police station, no. The vast distances inherent in interplanetary colonies necessitates the need for self-governance. There could be connections, yes; the first, say, American Mars colony might draft a constitution based on American law, with enumerated rights built into it (and likely updated to reflect contemporary society), and there would likely be an unwritten assumption that the colony would report to and follow all reasonable orders from their superiors (the Flight Directors and Mission Controllers from NASA), but once the colony becomes self-sustaining, they switch from being a long-term scientific mission to a truly independent colony, and they would then have the right and ability to break away from the chain, if they so desired.
doubt that, remember when the Thirteen colonies was supposed to be british, once the population reached a certain treshold the desire for independence and self rule will always increase. 
I doubt a unified single planet government would work. Imagine trying to keep every fucking village in Nepal or Nigeria in line with world government policies.
The key to long term success of any multi-anything government is to establish a common set of basic principles including self-determination, and restrain the higher level from micromanaging. All decisions need to be made as locally as possible, and decisions involving multiple jurisdictions can often be made just between those jurisdictions and only adopted systemwide when it's obviously beneficial and accepted by everyone already. IOW, the least "global governance" has the best prospect of long term success.
Mars eats spaceships, it'd be nice to have more nations investing in discovering techniques to slake its appetite.  UAE has some deep pockets, I'm looking forward to seeing how that shapes their efforts.

Written well before the SpaceX Guadalajara announcement, it's interesting to see the assumptions made about what's minimally possible with graspable technology.

I'd be interested in reading something more recent by this author on the subject to see if they acknowledge the existence of the ITS/MCT or if they stick to the Orion vision as the only possibility.
Im confident it will have to be solar supplemented with nuclear, each acting as a fail safe for the other, and nuclear taking the larger load
The question itself isn't answerable, yo bro you are looking at time/space as different things

What existed there before doesn't matter as there was no before, or there for that matter

What's to say the volume hasn't always been the same and the contents aren't merely uniformly decreasing in size
I think this is a fallacy of human perception and the need to quantify everything as "something", even if that something is "nothing". This creates a paradox that our brains simply cannot handle. You assume that the universe is expanding into "somewhere else", but that doesn't preclude the fact that the "somewhere else" didn't exist until the universe expanded into it. I know, it makes my brain hurt too. The fact is: with the knowledge we have now we simply don't know. Without any knowledge to the contrary its nothing more than pure speculation to assume anything else
It's not expanding into anything space between distant galaxies is expanding. The usual example given is to think of a deflated balloon. Using a marker you draw two dots one inch a part. Then you blow up the balloon. The dots will no longer be 2 inches apart. 
Infinity doesn't run out.

If you have infinite space, and the distance between every object increases, the size is still infinity.

Also worth pointing out that the big bang doesn't necessarily mean the universe expanded from a single point. More like all infinite points expanded from other infinite points which were initially closer together.
Space should rather be viewed as a byproduct of energy and matter. It is the result of successive expansion due to the expansion of the universe. Where expansion has yet to reach is a devoid of any known matter or energy. The answer is nothing, and this is a failure of your human mind to fully comprehend. You have yet to define any perimeters; once the values become described only then can we begin to examine it's properties. It's sort of like asking the question, "where do the photons come from when I turn on a light". As if to imply all the light particles are contained within a bulb, just waiting to be released. 
the way i see it, on the other side of the universe, there is nothing.  the universe is what is.  as it expands, being itself expands.  i don't think there is any "space" on the other side of the universe--no empty space for the universe to expand into.
Nothing. Space has properties such as transmissibility of radiation, matter can occupy it, etc. Outside of the expanding universe is literally nothing and it lacks any property that space has. 
I don't have an answer to your question what there was before the big bang, but this

> If the actions of the universe are from one giant explosion (the big bang) and is ever expanding in every direction due to the sheer force of the explosion,

is not correct. The big bang was not an explosion, and space isn't expanding because of an explosion. I don't know if it was a bad choice of words from your part or if you actually think that the big bang was an explosion with material (or space) being flung out in every direction, but I just thought I'd mention it.
I don't think the universe in expanding because of the explosion. I think the universe is expanding as a result of taking on mass and energy from outside our universe. But I subscribe to the theory that our universe is inside a black hole inside another universe. 
Theories? Okay:

Dark Energy. It's expanding into "sea" of dark energy that exists between the fabric of the multiverse.

Are you thinking of going on a rainy day because there is a chance of less people,  or is there another reason?
The bus tour is neat, they take you out to see some places where history happened.  First time I went, it was rainy and we couldn't see the launch pads.  

There's also a cool rocket garden outside.
I always thought one full day would keep you plenty busy there. There's a good amount of walking outside in between buildings and whatnot
Mentioning Mars One next to Boeing and SpaceX is an immediate GIANT RED FLAG.

Proceeding to make the article mostly ABOUT the discredited scam transitions from red flag territory to absolute hogwashville.  
"SpaceX, founded by battery billionaire Elon Musk, is leading the pack, with plans to send humans to Mars within eight years."


Having a plan or a goal does not equal progress or accomplishment. This article is filled with nonsense.

Edit: Dragon 2 intended for Mars as well as LEO, launched by Falcon FT. 
Cutting launch costs in half is a pretty astonishing achievement, if it turns out they are able to actually do it (as they claim).

I would certainly love to hear more what kind of new technologies, designs, could so drastically cut costs that much!

The article says something about a new engine, but doesn't go into details.

What kind of damage would a 20 meter asteroid do if it were to hit Earth?
Could the gravitational pull of Earth effect the orbit of something that small even at this distance?

That paper was full of the obvious when it was published last year.  Time has not made it any more newsworthy.
[link](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) and more info:

>Explanation: A nova in Sagittarius is bright enough to see with binoculars. Detected last month, the stellar explosion even approached the limit of naked-eye visibility last week. A classical nova results from a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of a white dwarf star -- a dense star having the size of our Earth but the mass of our Sun. In the featured image, the nova was captured last week above ancient Wat Mahathat in Sukhothai, Thailand. To see Nova Sagittarius 2016 yourself, just go out just after sunset and locate near the western horizon the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius), popularly identified with an iconic teapot. Also visible near the nova is the very bright planet Venus. Don’t delay, though, because not only is the nova fading, but that part of the sky is setting continually closer to sunset.

Sure, blame it on Trump, like everything else. You sure must be a sorry ass loser!
You know your vehicle is badass when each engine has a 55,000 horsepower fuel pump.
Looks like the flame is creeping up the bottom of the rocket. Anyone know why?

Are they still shock diamonds when they're larger than the size of the vehicle?
Hoooooly shit. It's hard to comprehend the sheer scale of those rockets. The full exhaust plume must be like what, a half mile long?
Looking at this pick it's hard to comprehend just how big this thing really is.

A few months back I was at JSC,& stood right next to a Saturn V.

it's unbelievable that something this huge could even fly.
why do i have to download this instead of just viewing it? why does that happen 
What - Why is this a download? OP, you need to put a warning in the title.

Google didn't find me a definition, but it did find a book with the word in the title.  What is "underexpaned"?
Having stood next to a Saturn V and seen how massive it is, the sight of that exhaust is intimidating. I still can't believe human beings built that thing, then climbed in and flew it to the moon and back....in the 1960's 
Was all that power really needed to get us to the moon or was it over kill? Why are rockets nowadays smaller than the Saturn V? 
So the plume can expand "out and up" in lower ambient pressure- but what would happen if the rocket were stationary (as if held in place for testing), how far could the plume "creep" if it weren't trying to outrun its exhaust?

[Here's video of the same event in the picture, Apollo 11 blasting its way off into space to the moon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1QIGscePs)
When you realise that the rocket at the top is taller than a 30-storey building.
Makes me think we could get a lot better thrust if we could find something that would complete it's burning expansion before it left the rocket.  Of course the might either end up being a fuel with very little expansion, or with too much expansion for the engine to contain.
Those look like Vernier thrusters on the sides. Are you sure it's all under-expansion?
Government lies...  ???? Scientology??? Is the moon a fucking turtle??? Who the fuck knows man 
In 800 years we are better off sending humans to another star with more habitable planets around it.
I've always been a fan of the idea of bombarding the poles with asteroid and comet redirect missions. Warm the planet while simultaneously increasing the mass of valuable chemicals such as water. 

The real truth is that if we want to terraform an entire planet, it's going to take a multifaceted approach. 
Yes, we can do all of that stuff. We just need about $1 trillion to pay for it all. 

Until somebody comes up with a plan for funding, it's fiction.
The diagram at the front of the article and in the thumbnail is confusing. The scale doesn't match the colors on the globe (no white or brown in the scale), and the globe is just the MOLA [terrain altitude map](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~seb/celestia/mars-mola-2k.jpg).

I'm about 90% sure that image is nonsense. 
So is this saying certain parts of a the surface are more tolerable than others to humans?
Despite being 1% as thick as the Earth's atmosphere, the Martian atmosphere actually does a lot to protect the surface.

But anyone saying that it presents a "big problem" is just flat out wrong. Radiation doesn't present a "big problem" to the astronauts going to the ISS (where the radiation levels are greater than the Martian surface). It simply limits how often you can go (a couple years on the ISS or 1-2 Mars missions before significant risk accumulates).

An extra 1% or 2% chance of getting cancer later in life isn't an insurmountable risk, simply a consideration. There are thousands of airline pilots who are exposed to higher radiation levels, and some of them probably don't even know about it.

And this is even before any attempt to block the radiation, like building underground and having a couple feet of dirt as protection.
This looks like security camera footage from a horror movie that suddenly flicks up with the killers face then cuts back to nothing.

10 billion. For **4000** satellites. What am I missing here, because that seems delusional, considering projected launch costs of the Falcon Heavy. Are these satellites going to weigh <500 kg each?
Would the connectivity drop during thunderstorms like with Satellite TV?

Send more rovers to mars, replace the hubble and build more radio scopes. 
well, if they want to play the long game, and just hold on to most of it, they could triple their annual budget for the next slightly more than the next 17 years, not accounting for investment, earned interest, or inflation. ( in 2015,the total us military budget was ~637 Billion dollars while NASA spent around ~18.01 Billion dollars... or about 1/35th that of the military )... but even as a proponent of peace, and of NASA, I'd hate to see what would happen to the military with NASA's budget...

edit: thanks u/Donald_Keyman for the correction... Wikipedia has it broken out into defense and total budget on a page named "Military budget of the United States" which I naively assumed total to mean total military (including, idk, offense?) rather than what it actually means,  which is total national budget... fixed. 
The unemployment crisis caused by the layoff of so many military would send America into a deep recession. 
For one year? Nothing. The clerical error would be fixed before anything significant would be built.

Worry not, in the coming decades we're bound to see USAF and CIA dabble in manned spaceflight again.
Advertising and lobbying.
TV. Books. Films. Newspapers. Every internet page for a day.
Advertise what could be possible if NASA was properly funded. Convince the population and congress that NASA is worth spending more on.
Then secure long term budget increases for years to come.
Sigh. This, again. But you do earn a gold star for the creative "clerical error." It gave me a chuckle. https://i.imgur.com/YYdRFXF.gifv

Nothing much. A year's worth of proper funding wouldn't really finish any missions faster, or advance science much further. Organizations on the scale of NASA have incredible inertia and need to be steered along five, ten, fifteen year timescales. A year simply isn't long enough, no matter how big the budget increase. 

Such a large increase for such a short period of time might be used to buy expensive new equipment or desired real estate, but remember that in the next year's budget, you won't be able to afford to pay the salaries of the engineers and scientists needed to staff your newly bought toys and offices.
I'd bank the money, hopefully the interest would pay for NASA full time
We would get a really lengthy report on how we need to do something right now about climate change, and plans to go to Mars in twenty years
In just one year? Not much I think. They'd probably begin construction of a ton of new probes, and maybe try to expand the international space station. Honestly though, you'd probably be disappointed. The really good stuff takes more time than a year to plan and execute. 
Buy nuclear missles from the cash-strapped military and go full throttle on Project Orion 
Not much considering virtually any space project worth doing with that kind of budget would take years to design, build, launch and perform its mission.
The depressing answer is very little. It takes far longer than a year to do grand programs, esp in government. I'm not even sure you would be able to hire all the personnel you would need before the year was up.
Instant funding for a huge number of missions and craft. The SLS and JWST would actually definitely be done by 2018. If it stayed like that for some years, there may well be a new reusable craft ready for surface-LEO exchanges. Missions to Europa, Ganymede, Titan, etc (though I wouldn't say rovers or submarines is anything near a certainty). Dedicated, long-term missions to Mercury, and at the very least flybys of Uranus and Neptune a la New Horizons. Missions to the asteroid belt, and more chiefly, the Kuiper Belt (may tie into the Uranus/Neptune missions). New satellites to look for exoplanets and generally look for things out there in the universe. And perhaps most importantly, significant funding for manned Mars exploration and planning for habitation.

Less atmosphere, but also less gravity. Napkin math says you'd need more lift surface (larger blades). 
[Mars helicopter, courtesy JPL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpBsFzjyRO8)
Mars certainly has an atmosphere and I've seen some proposals for aircraft to explore Mars.  I think most of them were fixed wing aircraft though.

The other big difference between Mars aircraft and Earth aircraft is there is no oxygen for a combustion engine, so it would have to be battery powered, and currently battery technology is not very great.  There's a lot to consider there.
Not a direct answer to your question, but here's a discussion on a related topic: https://what-if.xkcd.com/30/
density of air on mars is less than 1% of earth. https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-calculate-the-lift-of-a-helicopter-in-hover

you can see there is a linear relationship between density and lift/thrust. the gravity on mars is like 33% of earths. 

also, the engine wouldnt start.

thus, the atmosphere is way to thin to lift anything, basically.
Certainly an interesting idea for science fiction, though maybe not the Moon; we here on Earth actually need it. However, capturing an asteroid or comet, building that into a base (possibly by hollowing it out via mining), then driving around with that would hit a bit closer to reality. It still would not be efficient hauling around all that rock, at least not with our current engines. If we can somehow manage a reactionless engine with a whole bunch of thrust, then maybe we could.
>Probably not very doable but it *would* be easier to build a massive base on the Moon because a shorter distance and then move it to Mars.

With the energy required to move the moon into Martian orbit you could build the buildings on Mars many times over and then some.
For the same amount of energy, we can pack up everything we've ever built on this planet, include seven billion people, and then send *that* to Mars.
So I know it's art and that makes this question pointless.

But, why?
meh. looks ridiculous in a gallery type setting. all of this was much better presented all together at the cavernous armory in new york several years ago. that was dark with spot lights and had a real 'capricorn one' vibe.
there art then there is this. its made out of crap it doesn't even try to be realistic or educating. its completely pointless like all art stuff. it not a space program. its something a 5 years old would do to play only with more time and budget.
Since we have no real shielding... it's a big problem.

>Where does it all come from? 

Some of it we put there, and some of it comes from the universe itself. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) took me 5 seconds of googling.

>Can we see it in pictures of the Earth?

Most of it is too small.

>Additionally, if this is a problem what precautions are being taken to reduce the orbit of this junk?

Currently... none.
ISS avoids the debris they can track, below that size the shields are designed to break up the impactor, although some projectiles are too big for the shields and too small to track.  Some rockets will choose trajectories that minimize orbital debris risk. 
There is no real need to navigate around the junk, it's simply to spread out. The ISS will rarely (maybe a few times a year) maneuver to avoid debris. No rocket has ever had to actively avoid debris AFAIK. 

Space is really really big even just the space around the Earth, so the chances of a collision are very small. That said it still happens on a rare occasion. 
Great video. No sensationalism, and now I get to read Greg Egan's paper. [It's here](http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/SCIENCE/Cavity/Cavity.html) for anyone who's interested.
Anyone remember the [neutrinos that went faster than light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly)? A result that would have completely turned physics on its head, but turned out to be a loose cable in the end? 

Skepticism turned out to be correct approach for the CERN result five years ago, and things as extraordinary as the EM drive deserve just as much skepticism. 

Science isn't about hope, it's about observations, hypotheses, and evidence. So far, the EM drive doesn't have enough of any of these three things.
Hey /u/Illectro, what do you think of this explanation for the Em Drive?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/50eh6e/an_independent_scientist_has_confirmed_that_the/d73o67j/
Why does he keep using the phrase "breaking the laws of physics". You'd think he would be more careful and precise in his wording when making a video like this. Also, there is no reason to talk about the performance characteristics of this device. We don't even know if it works, and if it does, whatever thrust it can give pales in comparison to its contribution to the field of physics it would give us. It's like someone announces they were able to create a Star Trek replicator and everyone starts discussing how the Earl Grey it makes will taste instead of focusing on testing if it works and how it works first.

Edit: thanks for the downvotes, I guess I really wasn't contributing to the discussion about this video. But hey, at least I'm fun at parties.
My offer stands, to any interested parties who believe in the EM drive: your yearly income (with proof), at 1:1 odds, that the EM drive doesn't produce reactionless thrust in negligible gravitational and EM fields in the absence of atmosphere. The transaction will be in BTC via third-party escrow, on public record. The EM drive will turn out to be a trivial error like the "faster-than-light" neutrinos, but even more embarrassing due to the amount of attention it got from normie media. Put your money where your mouth is and stop regurgitating this bullshit.
It's amazing that other scientists really want this to fail, one Australian scientist sums up the general opinion

“It’s looking stronger,” Dr Neumann says. “But it’s still breaking the law of conservation of momentum — which is something we’d really like to keep as it’s the basis of some really important bits of science and technology.”

“If we have to modify it (Newton’s Third Law), that’s fine,” Dr Neumann says. “But we can’t just get rid of it.”

So much science is based on the fact the engine can't work, they really don't want it to be true, literally thousands of academic careers will be ruined as science is forced to look at what other basic laws may be flawed.and force a rethink of everything we thought we knew
Umm...did you read the webpage?

"These images, taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on board ESA’s Mars Express spacecraft, **show a patch of water ice sitting on the floor of an unnamed crater** near the Martian north pole."
I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but i need to know, is this ice in this crater above the surface, or has the photo been taken using some weird camera that can find ice from below the surface?

Is this a true color photograph?  It looks almost fake.  Pretty amazing stuff.
The headline sucks. The shuttle was the product of late 60's and early 70's technology. By today's standards, it was primitive, but it still got the job done.
The engine design in the drawings appears to be more primitive than Skylon's. Otherwise, this appears to be a repackaging of public Skylon documents as a Chinese development program.

Personally, I think it is unlikely to come to anything, but I also think it is worthy of being reported in /r/space, just in case they have decided to put the funds behind this effort that Skylon so obviously lacks.
Important difference between this spaceplane and the Skylon as envisioned by Reaction Engines is that this one lacks the fancy pre-coolers that make the Sabre engines of the Skylon so special. For this Chinese spaceplane they opted for "regular old" scramjets to propel the craft to near orbital speeds.
Heh, I know Reaction Engines are getting funding for SABRE development, but is someone dishing out the cash for Skylon airframe work? China could do that and just contract with RE for the "flying fridge" power plants. After all RE is British so ITAR doesn't apply and the UK gov are increasingly chummy with China.
Fantastic achievement for China, they have a plan and they are meeting their scheduled goals. The future is going to show which is a better form of government, a government of mostly engineers with no lawyers or religious people, or a government that thinks movie stars and reality TV personalities surrounded by lawyers and religious people is the better form of government.  If China leads the way in becoming a major alternative energy supplier along with a gigantic Asian continent electric power network, the US becomes less and less significant as far as being a major space power.
Giving the mongolians ideas how to finally get past that damned wall!

But in all seriousness - great job china!

I really wonder how and what the space race is going  to be like 
Excellent work, I'm excited to see how their modular station shapes up.  I believe it will be the centerpiece of their next crewed mission...?
I kept expecting the camera to swing around as the rocket reached orbit.

Also the refocus when the LM and CSM docked was exactly like KSP.

And then the continuous misjudging at landing...

I have an addiction.
So basically, if you live in the UK there is no hope. There is light pollution everyone and you cannot get away from it :(
Hi /r/space! You guys are familiar with my work by now. I'm a 16 year old photographer living on Florida's Space Coast. Normally I'm credentialed to shoot launches on CCAFS property, which means I'll [set up sound triggered cameras at the launchpads](http://johnkrausphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DSC_8049-1.jpg), but as NASA was involved with this launch, my application for credentials was denied because I'm underage.

That didn't stop me, though! I headed to Playalinda Beach, a public access beach six miles north of the launchpad to shoot the launch. Initially I had planned to use an ND filter as the launch was scheduled for 5:42pm. After an hour of holds, the launch went at 6:42pm, making the ND filter unnecessary. 

If you'd like to check out more of my work, follow me on [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/johnkrausphotos) and check out my website www.johnkrausphotos.com. 

Edit: some people asked for camera settings, so I'll just leave them here:

182 second exposure, f/14, ISO 100, 11mm

Nikon D7100, Tokina 11-20mm f/2.8
I'm most impressed by the two people on the left, who stood perfectly still the whole time :). 
Let's all remember one very important thing about GOES-R; if someone asks if you're a god, you say "YES!"
I like to think that's what it would look like if Goku was real and flew off as a Super Saiyan.
Does anyone know if this would have been possible to see from Australia? My co-worker and I saw a light that moved really slowly and for a really long time this morning (around 6am I think). It looked amazing whatever it was.
That's one of the most amazing pictures I've ever seen.  Fan. Tastic.
Beautiful shot! What were your settings and how long did you hold the exposure for? 
Whoa look at those half-phased out people, it's like I'm seeing the 5th dimension haha.

Damn I gotta study orbits more, escape velocity and what not.
What amazes me in this photo is pretty clear vision of waves closer to horizon. On exposure this long, those waves had to hit alot of times in the same place to be pictured that clear (compare to almost clean sea closer to photograph, where all waves got blurred)
Is this satellite going to tell me to choose the form of the destructor?

I'm hearing that technologically it is tw full generations ahead of anything in use now. 
It kinds looks like people happily watching a meteor smash into their planet
Awesome shot!  So, what accounts for the curve of the trajectory?  I assume they are launched in a straight path, but the earth is spinning and you're rotating away from the rocket. Is that it?
After all the SpaceX pictures you have shot already, I really miss the two entry burn streaks here.

Amazing picture!
Fantastic photo!  I've been in Florida for just over a year and I got to see a launch for the first time. I watched from Fort Pierce and it was just as spectacular. It was a great birthday present to myself. 
Always ending up on my front page, Kraus! I didn't end up going out there, trying to recover from the plague. Nice shot! 
This is great, John.  This location and the Satellite Beach shots are even more dramatic than the close-up shots, i.m.o. Love all your images.
You even got some shooting rocks in the top left corner, or maybe parts of the satellite
Do you just set this on a 1 minute exposure? Or are there tons of setting you need to change
AMAZING SHOT! Hope to see more of your work in the future!

Followed you on insta :) 
Nice work. I'm a photographer. Good composition aswell. Keep it up.

Nice picture but I can't see neither the boost back burn nor the landing burn!
/u/johnkphotos great composition. Were you aware beforehand of the general direction of the trail?
Shit we had one of the closest spots from the rocket. My video/picture looked like ass.
If I was in your shoes I wouldn't know what photo to take. I would wanna take the long exposure but also a normal static photo. I'd probably solve this with two cameras.
It was a beautiful night for the launch...too bad it didn't launch in early part of the window - could have caught the sunset at altitude. Never gets old!
Just wondering if you left the camera shutter open longer would you see the curve continue down over the horizon or was this basically when the light became too dim to see?
Well thats why i couldnt see it from St. Augustine, its trajectory was low. I can see shuttle launches so i figured i could see this one
Super Mario Galaxy (2007)

Seriously though, astounding work. I wish I could see it personally, but, you know... Brazilian and stuff.
it's great! I really like the shadows in this one... do you edit your shots in Photoshop? it could make them even better.
I sometimes walk on a pier by my house that gives me a wide open view of the ocean, and I can see a slight amount of arc on the horizon. I'm always in awe that the slight amount I can see makes a full circle. To see this photo illustrates that beautifully.
So the trail just looks curved to us on Earth, because the Earth is a sphere? In reality the trail is a straight line?
Another rocket launch clearly showing NASA rockets dont go up into space! Earth is flat, stationary, geocentric center of our universe and NASA is a fraud. 
Yep. There is the proof we all needed that the earth is in fact flat
Flat earth, it just lands in the ocean, unable to penetrate the dome.
I like how the long exposure has ghost-like effect on the other observers almost as if to emphasize the fleeting nature of an individual life juxtaposed with the steady march of technology and progress.

I'm aware that this was trying too hard.
Um... guys? I think there's something wrong in that neighborhood...

GHOSTBUSTERS!!!
Usually the california site used to launch "weather satellites", so quite possibly a legit weather satellite.

(spy satellites at times are launched as other types of satellites like "weather")
Classic wasteful government spending. They would get into space a lot faster if they just went straight.

Bottom right of the screen.
If you could post the date and approximate location someone can likely verify the pass. 
With all due respect, I HIGHLY doubt this was unexpected and I bet you planned for it in advance. 

I'd love to be proven wrong, though. 
wow, like i knew it was small from earth (never spotted it) but this puts it a hole lot more into perspective.
I think putting the Big Red Spot on Jupiter's flag would look even better. 
Alright, [PLANET FLAGS REV.2](https://i.imgur.com/559OwbN.jpg). Rotated uranus and added jupiter's spot. Removed the iss from earth since I feel like that's too much detail. They're supposed to be flags, after all, and I even hesitated to put in the moons around jupiter saturn uranus and neptune for the sake of simplicity.
Also, true colours are overrated
One suggestion is to somehow showcase that Uranus (and it's entire system) is laying on it's side relative to the plane of the ecliptic.  This is such a massive anomaly in our Solar System, it's almost impossible to fathom how the entire system got turned on it's side, yet is still in the relative plane of the other bodies.  An easy way to do so, given that the surficial features of Uranus do not show it well, is to have the ring system almost straight up and down (more like 98deg).

Also, Phobos and Diemos are so, so small relative to Mars, but, I know the satellite representation in the flags is not meant to be anywhere near accurate.
It would be awesome if the sun shrank as you go further out out of the solar system
I feel bad for Pluto. Out there all cold and alone. It doesn't even get a flag. 
So I came across [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_Earth.svg) and thought it would be nice to give the other planets the same treatment :)
they look amazing, hope one day we'll have to use them 
 i think you should give jupiter and uranus their rings too (i also think neptune has rings ) 
They'd be into this over in /r/vexillology so I X-Posted it [and gave you credit of course!](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/5dzpev/the_planets_of_our_solar_system_by_u_gucky_xpost/)  Nice work :) 
Neat idea. You won't appease everyone. I would say these are far too complex. My gripes are:

1. The ISS is too complex for a flag, same with the very tiny moons around Jupiter. Flags should be easily identified. Cut anything that isn't needed.
1. Too many colors. You want to have three or four colors tops. Sun, Planet, Space, and maybe one accent color (jupiter red spot, saturn rings, earths land masses)
1. All planets are the same relative on each. Obviously they cannot be to scale, but Jupiter is 30 times the radius of mercury. Should be reflected.
1. The sun is the same in all of them despite the distances being two orders of magnitude different from the closest to the farthest. As before, obviously they cannot be to scale. Maybe you could make the sun smaller in radius and further off  'flag' the further you get out.
1. The satellites of the planets is a bit misleading. A lot of them are sub 100km diameter which is more like an asteroid than a moon. Some of those sats, Ganymede and Titan, are larger than Mercury. Maybe only include the spherical bodies around planets as we 100% know all of them. We may never find all the small bodies orbiting the gas giants, but the large ones are locked in. To that note, Deimos and Phobes are way to tiny to care about.
1. Should those large Jovian, Saturnian, Uranian, and Neptunian sats get flags as well with the planet in the place of the sun and a tiny sun off in the distance?
Thanks for all the feedback! I've decided to [simplify](http://imgur.com/a/CA5u6) them. As I said, I don't like the idea of the shrinking sun because (a) the sun is the common factor and (b) it's impossible to do properly (∆d between planets makes it so the sun would barely change for the planets inside the asteroid belt). Added a flag for the entire solar system to reflect that.

Also, one moon for Earth as our first home, two for Mars as our second one, hopefully.
I feel like the flags need not to be visually representative of planets. These are cool, but I don't think circles upon circles are going to do it. 

I'd be curious to see you do these up as a series of traditional designs, like vertical and horizontal tricolors and Nordic crosses. Then, when it came time to do flags for the moons, you could put the planetary flag in the canton and build something new for each moon. Europe or Titan would need its own flag, for instance, and could use this "colonial" model (See NZ or AUS flags), and the details of your circular design would not get lost. 

Incidentally, [this is my favorite flag of planet earth](http://www.flagofplanetearth.com/)
Meh, redact the sun then put dotted lines between the sun and planet to indicate it's orbit, and you left out a lot of moons. Oh the encircling dots are moons. Um that's damn hard to count them in that pattern.
When a black hole evaporates due to hawking radiation, it doesn't go bang, it just vanishes.

You've almost got it, but you're not quite putting two and two together - you know that a black hole will slowly lose mass through hawking radiation, but then you state that at the end the black hole will release all the mass inside it - but there isn't any anymore.
Alright little man, take physics as one of your high school options, learn as much as you can refine your theory. Find some evidence that backs up your theory. I look forward to seeing PointlessSmurf's theory of creation through "white holes".
I'm not sure your hypothesis is correct, but your enthusiasm in incorrigible. Asking for criticism of your ideas is a hard thing to do but is absolutely critical for the scientific process.

Keep studying and keep trying to refute your ideas and when you're done with your education you'll be a great critical thinker. Even better, continue your education and become an astrophysicist, then spend you're days collecting and analysing your own data, and really trying answer the universe's big questions.
First, let me congratulate you on your enthusiasm like everyone else. The unfortunate fact is that physics is actually much more complicated and subtle than what they show in documentaries, so I'm sorry to say that I don't think your theory is viable.

There are a couple of issues. One is that a white hole is not the same as a radiating black hole. It's an eternal (like a black hole) region of space from which everything must escape eventually. When you get right down to it, a white hole doesn't make a lot of sense in the real world since it has a singularity in the far past, which means that the things that escape are undetermined, since they come from the singularity. To me this says that we need a better theory if we want to consider the existence of white holes.

The other problem is that the Big Bang wasn't an explosion. It was simply a point where, if you follow the laws of physics backwards, everything was infinitely close together. Your supermassive black hole couldn't be a Big Bang because a black hole lives inside the universe while the Big Bang is a state of the whole universe, not an explosion that occurred inside of it.

The expansion of the universe also doesn't simply mean that matter is moving away from each other like it would after an explosion. Rather, space itself is expanding. In a certain sense, galaxies and such are sitting still in an expanding space.

In fact, this post made me realize that popular descriptions never mention the fact that the Big Bang isn't the cause of expansion. The current expansion of the universe isn't inertia. Rather, it's determined by its matter content at each point in time. The Big Bang is therefore not the cause of expansion, it's just its initial point.
Unfortunately you're not the only one to have this theory.   I think it was in the new series of Cosmos that NDGT mentioned the theory that white holes could be big bangs, with each one creating its own universe 
I think you're off-base by saying white holes are analogous to "new" big bangs. The whole point of calling it a "Big Bang" is that there was only one and from it came everything. 

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but (in my similar layman's understanding) a white hole is  a theorized region where information taken into a black hole elsewhere is instead projected out. There can be more than one that exists within the universe, and we have no reason to believe more entire universes come out of them. White holes output matter and energy; the Big Bang generated *space itself*. It's not a matter of simply expanding our perspective.

It would be nice to hear from a physicist who knows more about these things though. :)
On a similar note, Rosie O'Donnells birth doubled the mass of the planet Earth.
We are neither militarily, scientifically, nor mentally ready for first contact with a species capable of FTL or Near-light speed travel.

So, to answer your question, you should hope that you live to never see Aliens in your lifetime.

We need to at least have the AI singularity occur this century to be even close to ready. Now THAT is something you can cautiously excited about.
It is a real possibility that we will find microbial life in this solar system in the next several decades.  In the same time-frame we can build telescopes orders of magnitude better than the ones we have today.  This could allow us to detect  life in nearby solar systems.  Other than that, it is possible that Alien civilizations will come to us, but this seems extremely improbable to me.  I see no reason why the century would be more likely than any century in the last billion years.
This is a wake up call for you to live the healthiest life you can, so you can have a chance at alieons. 
pretty mind blowing if true:

http://nypost.com/2016/11/18/aliens-are-all-around-you-says-ivy-league-professor/
What if we already have? Alien life will most likely take a form that we as humans will not recognize as life. 
Well, there are three possibilities.

A) The expansion rate keeps accelerating any the universe rips itself apart (Big Rip)

B) The expansion rate reaches some comfy steady speed and everything just dies out in billions upon billions of years.

C) The expansion slows, and starts decelerating, gravity clumps everything together again (Big Crunch), and then that *might* also cause another big bang (Big Bounce)
Current estimates put 71% of the universe consisting of dark energy. That makes the remaining 29% dark matter and visible matter, which, assuming the numbers all stay the same, would not nearly be enough to reverse the accelerating expansion (and indeed the expansion is accelerating.) I'm no expert but I think that's the leading theory, and it means the Big Rip is the ultimate fate of the universe. The expansion will eventually overpower fundamental forces - firstly gravity, tearing apart galactic clusters, then galaxies themselves, then star systems, then planet-moon systems, then individual objects themselves, until nothing can interact gravitationally. This will then move on to electromagnetic and two nuclear forces, after which point no two particles will ever be able to interact with one another. The universe will be an exponentially-expanding sea of extremely sparsely scattered particles.
"Will the universe eventually pull itself back together" and get it's sh#t together?! XD 

(Plz, no ban! I love space related science but I just couldn't help myself...)
>when the stars explode and create black holes will it all pull itself back into a super dense point

It is important to note that when a star becomes a black hole, it doesn't increase in mass, so the gravity will stay the same outside of the star's initial volume. So if the sun just became a black hole, the earth would continue to orbit it as usual and I don't think all of the stars becoming black holes would really do anything. 
The physical universe consists of stars and their products. Not all stars become "black holes", that is, collapse into singularities. Stars are Natural Radioactive Nuclear Fusion Reactors. They are burning hydrogen and helium fuel. As space-time keeps expanding, these stars will burn out like a match stick head. There will be a very low energy carbon and heavy element concentration left. Eventually, everything burns out and all the extremely low energy matter keeps spreading further and further apart, until there is no gravitational interaction and the physical universe settles into random infrared entropy a couple degrees above absolute 0. Space-time keeps expanding into infinity and atoms eventually are spread so far apart, they only exist as ions and quarks.  
  
The physical, optical, interacting, tangible universe of Natural Radioactive Fusion Reactors is much like a soap bubble, a straw blowing it bigger and bigger, and when it pops, it dissipates into Nothing.
We can never trully know the ways our universe has shifted but we can be mostly sure that it expands constantly. 
TL;DR: we don't fully understand all of the weirdness of the universe and what we do think could be wrong... It just might be aliens.

*God of the Gaps*, but with aliens.
This is a scenario in which the acceleration of the expansion of space becomes so large that in essence the distances between elemantary particles become so large that they can not interact anymore (same effect as an infinite distance), so everything gets "ripped apart". 
Not only planets but also atoms and their constituends would be destroyed, space itself however is completely fine, just expanding forever.
>The big rip doesn't make any sense to me at all

It's just a theory.

> The universe isn't a piece of fabric

Says who ?

>Would planets be torn?

Planets can easily be torn apart... Easily in this case is relative, but a neutron star wouldn't even notice that it was [destroying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlTSXr4PfSg) the earth.
Nothing, get a pair of 7x50 binoculars. Good telescopes start around $300.

A scope that costs $100 will ruin your interest. 7x50s will show a decent amount, and under dark skies you'll be able to see detail in Andromeda (but in the city or suburbs there's no hope of that).
Binoculars are also a great tool to learn the night sky, its a lot easier to pan around and take a peek at the sky than with a scope. I agree with going with a goof set of binoculars(~75-100$)
I second binos. Don't spend $100 on a scope. 

Here's a cheap 10x50 with informative reviews from stargazers

The best scope for now may be one you do not own. Find a local a "sky-watch" or "star-party." Amateur astronomy clubs are a great place to start depending where you live. That way you can actually see the different types. Members of the club also likely have better scopes than you or I will be able to afford even a decade from now. The best part is, at least at the ones i go to, members of the club are stoked to educate anyone who wants to learn. Once you decide to invest in one for yourself, remember the best first telescope is one you will USE most frequently (which can mean balancing power with portability).  Half the fun of a telescope is to share the experience

The jaded says, in other news a new weather satellite was put into orbit.  
  
Look at the size of the payload capsule compared to the main orbital launch core.  
  
[ULA Atlas 5 GOES](http://static-14.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/b5018069-1432-471f-8e13-ee00e352b843-large16x9_SpaceSatelliteLaunc_Mimi.jpg?1479600037895)  
  
There is new news in what seems like old news. ULA launch facilities are clean and lean. They are making orbital insertion look very routine. The payloads are getting huge. It shows the competition with SpaceX has resulted in major efficiencies in major areas. If they also are able to start lowering launch costs while keeping a favorable profit, it would be good news all the way around.

In other news, a new weather satellite has been put into orbit.  
  
Of course it is the most advanced. Why would anyone pay to fire a 30 year old satellite into space?  
I find this often used headline very silly. Every time some politician or businessman opens a new site, be it a hospital or a university or an office tower, they always underline how this is the most advanced ever. *Of course it bloody is, it's brand new!*
The bit you're missing is 'propellant'. An EM drive doesn't need any. That means it can accelerate for as long as it can produce power. 
Dawn, the most advanced ion spacecraft at the moment carried 425 kg of xenon propellant and had 10,000 m/s of delta-v for missions. 275 kg (64%) of that xenon was used to reach Vesta and perform its mission there. And that was saving propellant by way of a gravity assist from Mars. A further 110 kg (26%) was used to reach and orbit Ceres. Dawn has only 10% of its propellant left. It is essentially out of "fuel" and thus its missions have ended.

As you can see, transfer trajectories use up a lot of propellant. Dawn only reached 3 celestial bodies in total (Mars, Vesta, Ceres) and now its empty, but those 3 bodies were what the mission planners planned.

If (and it's a big if) the EM drive is real, the spacecraft would never run out of fuel because it requires none. Its delta-v is essentially infinite as long as it can generate electricity. It could visit anywhere in the solar system. Are you done with Ceres, then let's make a flyby of Venus. Done there, then let's visit every large asteroid. Got bored of asteroids, let's go visit Jupiter why not.

Telling a rocket scientist they have infinite delta-v for their spacecraft's missions is a big deal.

Whether it is cost effective to build an EM drive spacecraft versus the amount of scientific data generated is another matter however. Right now, scientists are content to send their spacecraft on one way missions.

Call me skeptical but to receive such benefits for no cost is too good to be true. 
The key thing to remember is that IF this device works it is at the first step of a long chain of actions, which will focus on:

1.  determining why the hell it does what it does
2.  determining how to make the thruster more efficient

It is not inconceivable that if the EM drive works that there is a lot of efficiency to be gained by tweaking RF frequencies and cavity configuration - There's nothing magic about microwaves; if this phenomenon works for microwaves it should work for radio waves, x-rays, infrared etc with the correct reconfiguration of the resonant cavity.

If this works, it is not inconceivable to expect outputs in the milinewton / kW or higher once large-scale research starts.
Revolutionary, but not too useful in their present form. As your own calculations show. The powerplant mass may make ion thrusters a more attractive option for most interplanetary missions.
The big deal with EM drives -- *if* it proves to be real -- is that they appear to violate Newton's 3rd law of motion. That's really fucking weird. So far as we know the universe doesn't let you do that. 

So, *if* the engine is real, then there's very likely some new physics being exploited by it that we do not yet understand. The thrust isn't the big deal here, it's how the thrust is being produced.
People need to remember there are now better solar panels than they bought for the ISS.

Here is the relevant page from Spectrolab for space-rated panel.

http://www.spectrolab.com/DataSheets/Panel/panels.pdf
Right now it is not particularly useful. Installing one capable of counteracting the drag the ISS experiences would increase power consumption by at least 25%. That's a big deal and not worth it. They will likely be able to refine it, increasing thrust and decreasing power requirements.
I wonder if two side-by-side drives would be additive, or one drive inside another. Do they combine, destructively or constructively, or something different?
Asteroid mining. Puttering along from rock to rock without needing to use fuel. Sounds very useful.
Wow. Sunsets on the red planet are blue, and sunsets on the blue planet are red.
That's fascinating. Look from Earth, you can see orange bright yellow colors. 

This looks grey.
I cannot believe in my life time that here I am sitting on one planet and able to see in perfect clarity and colour the sunset from another planet entirely! This blows my mind!!! 
One day we will live there, see the sun set and think about how beautiful earth used to be.
Amazing how small the sun looks from there, and how much more blue!!
I clicked and started staring at it and waiting for the sun to set and I'm like "this is the slowest GIF ever"... 
Not gonna lie, I'm pretty jealous of the people of the future who will get to wake up to this every morning.
yeah Im not feeling the romance here. Think I'm staying on earth for sunsets.
I cannot wait for the day when the first humans take their first steps on another world! The Incredible thing is, it *is* going to happen within our lifetime!

I'm just imagining the first humans on Mars watching this and just being let down so much
for some reason I thought this was a GIF so i just stared at the picture for like a minute just waiting for the sun to actually rise up
Shout out to all the science people who made this possible - you rock!
To think that one day, humans might actually be able to see this in person, blows me away. Pictures like this make me excited for the future
How come it looks so far away compared to Earth, I get that its farther but I just didn't know it would look THAT far away
Makes the air look so cool and clean, like a strong misty morning.

If a person was on Mars would they be able to safely look at that without damaging their eyes?
This reminds me of the memorable closing statements  in Kobie Boykinson's talk on NASA's Mars Rovers: ["...And the thing that makes me love this image so much is literally the fact that someday a human will stand on the surface of Mars and say, "I'm watching the Earth set, and then I'm watching the Sun set"..."](https://youtu.be/7zpojhD4hpI?t=24m16s) 

Although that was only the closing statement, the talk's entirety was informational and entertaining as well, and I recommend you all to give it a watch if you have the time.
If it's true that Women are from Venus and Men are from Mars, it's sad that women don't get to see these sunsets.
Seeing this I suddenly hear Hans Zimmer in the background of my mind 

Edit: Hans not hand. Damn auto correct

Am I the only that sees that as incredibly terrifying? So much nothingness.
"This is the last time I'm getting discount seating from Ticketmaster."
I know there's only one sun, but I saw this picture and Binary Sunset started playing in my head...
Since Mars has only 1% atmosphere compared to earth, shouldn't normal sunsets be very clear?
Reminds me of [*Alien*](http://s19.postimg.org/l505009gh/alien_movie_screencaps_com_2797.jpg) ([here's another screenshot from a little earlier](http://s19.postimg.org/mirrvb8pt/alien_movie_screencaps_com_2753.jpg)).
I actually really like it. I know a lot of this is the photo itself, but it looks like frosted glass to me.  More like a matte surface.
If mars is round, why is the horizon concave shaped!? (dont take this post seriously please)
Given that Mars is farther away from Earth, what size would the Sun be in the sky when looking up at a Martian sunset, compared to a Earth sunset? Would the Sun be as bright on Mars mid day, or less bright when compared to Earth? I assume that the Sun would look a lot smaller, and would give off less sunlight on Mars which means that we humans might be living in a "darker" world when we colonize Mars. This is just a layperson guess. Someone set me straight! 

Thanks! 
May sound like a stupid question, but would the sun still be too bright to look at?
Somehow, out of all the pictures from Mars, this one really brings it home for me.
Is the blue created from the color of the light passing through the gasses or some other reason?

How utterly alien, and yet familiar! Space is such a wondrous place. 
The sunset on the mars looks very much similar to that on earth. The only difference is that we cannot live on Mars currently because of no oxygen and no water and a hot climate. Wow, an extraordinary snapshot it is!
If you want to have fun learning about atmosphere, try the Apple Store game "TerraGenesis". It's a terraforming strategy game. Really well done.

DAMN YOU CORPORATE OVERLORDS!!
Pft mars needs to get their shit together.  Our sun is so much bigger than theirs. Fucking amatures. 
There is so much to this picture. Notice how small the sun looks. Assuming it isn't just because of the picture, it really puts into perspective the distance that separates us. 
I keep forgetting how the sun would look wayyy smaller on mars than here on earth. That could pose psychological problems to anyone living there long-term. So little sunlight compared to earth
Little known fact.. the sun is actually white. Our atmosphere makes it look orange but when you get out into space it's bright white.
Kinda terrifying. So empty and vast. Strange to see the sun so small. 
I didn't realize they had color cameras on Mars. 

Or was this colored afterwards?
[deleted]
Mars, China? 

Kidding aside, really hope this is not future in Earth.
Hahaha we don't even have real pictures of Erath, but we have real pictures from Mars..... 
It's striking how much smaller the sun looks from Mars compared to Earth.
Gawd, the sun is so small there. They would really be much further from it than us. 
And somewhere on that horizon Matt Damon is fiddling with his crew mates shit and potatoes trying to earn a living. Glorious.
naa na naaa naaa na na naaaa naaa na naaa na na na na na na naaaaa
Jesus fuck we look so small in space. Even though it's obvious we are this looks so much more fucking real.
I find it fascinating that the sun appears so much smaller here then in a terrestrial sunset — you can really notice the multi-million kilometer difference in distance.
A desolate planet.  Perhaps the remnants of a past earth like planet devastated by life that eventually killed themselves off, or a planet that used to be closer (same orbit as earth) until it keep moving further out away from the sun and now we have a dead planet.
Wow, thank you for this. Is there a source? Where did this come from? 
Somewhere out there is a a droid that can speak the binary language of moisture evaporators.
I can't wait until we pollute Mars' atmosphere so we can have proper sunsets there, too.
Very beautiful I wanna go to Mars now!! [UPCpodcast ](http://traffic.libsyn.com/upcpodcast/Driverless_Cars_2_Final.mp3) 
Is this like... what it looks like when I try to take a pic of the sunset? If so I can only imagine it's prettier. 
Now this looks legit, unlike the Apollo Moon mission pictures of Earth. It's funny how while Apollo was in transit to the moon, Earth looked kinda far away, but once they got there, the pictures from the surface made Earth look huge. I still suspect we never landed on the moon.
I feel like Saturn was ripped off in this picture. It has stunning rings and they look common here. :/
You know, IRL Jupiter's ring isn't very obvious as first glance. I feel that it should be just a thin ring.
Just FYI, Yellow and Black are the colors for anarcho-capalists.

Not a huge problem, but not sure if you're worried about accidental political implications.
Again:

Venus is a white ball, not green :( (and not brown like NASA shows it, thats surface color below the clouds.. and with IR, you see a white ball with clouds below.. without IR or radar, Venus is a white ball!).

Why did you ignore this? :(
Very nice. This is the first space mission I remember watching live. Having been born in 1970, I was too young during the moon missions. 

There was a long wait for the space shuttle after this. 
Wow, that is really incredible.  It actually looks like you have your own "style" of painting, do you have other works to show?  Do you sell prints?
This is awesome. It's a shame the Apollo spacecraft got cancelled. Thankfully we still have Soyuz.
Looks like an establishing shot from a late 80s/early 90s anime like DBZ or something. Nice job
This is so great. Well done! The cooperation between the US and Russian space agencies gives me hope for the future. Hopefully their respective governments will follow their examples.
[deleted]
The connector between the two spacecraft, was it launched with Apollo or Soyuz?
My favourite bit about this is that they had to design a new type of dock (Androgynous Peripheral Attach System) because neither country was willing to be the one getting penetrated in a traditional male/female dock. 
Very nice picture! Very detailed, and the colors are amazing!

My one gripe is that the Apollo CSM is missing its high-gain antenna.
I paint for a hobby, and this is hands down miles ahead of me. Great job!! I love the clouds over the planet. Keep up the beautiful work!!
Wow, that's good! I've always been a big fan of the Soyuz spacecraft.
Very awesome! 

Can you comment on how you did your clouds? I've been working on my first acrylic painting , a mock up of a portion of an art piece by David Hardy called "terraforming Mars". The thing I have been having trouble with is making cloud cover that doesn't just look like blotches from a brush...
Awesome. You're very talented. Not everyone can see a painting like this through to completion. 
I'll just let you compare your work with Leonov's: http://scifiart.narod.ru/Albums/6/6_304.htm#1
The lines of your station in contrast to your clouds are not clean enough. It looks strange.

I'm also not sure about the geometrics about the station to the right. It also looks broken.
When Europeans decided to get the hell outa dodge and explore the world, they were private merchants, sanctioned and partially funded by their monarchs.  Is it time for NASA, JPL, etc.. to be dismantled over time and let the private companies with government oversight to take over our next steps in the solar system exploration? 

It just seems that political bureaucracy has constantly gotten in the way since the last moon landing.  
Have we considered orbital eccentricity as a possible factor in climate change?
What will happen if time stops? What will happen to the gravitational pull? 
Why do we want to terraform other planets? Couldn't we just terraform Earth and make it more habitable if we needed too? It seems like it would be the easier option. 
I have kind of an astrophysics question if that is ok.
One of my teachers told me a story of somebody that accidentally looked at an experiment that gave off a lot of harmful light that he was not suppose to look at. He only took a glance, but supposedly his eye basically melted as his retina started to fall off.
Given this, why does this not happen when we look at light from a star that is likely much more harmful than the experiment. I cannot cite you a particular instance, or a particular star, but in theory, it is still puzzling to me.
Not really space specific but semi related? Have any of you been on the vomit comet? I'm considering that as something to put on the bucket list since I don't think space flight would be in my future. What's the experience like? 
I need your help for my finally project for school. I want to create a book about Stars life cycle and for that It would be amazing if I could get as many as you to do this survey I have created a some Questions about the Stars and how I can make it interesting for a reader like you.

The Grey Frame/Structure in Baiconur Cosmodrome. What is it?

http://www.energia.ru/en/iss/iss50/progress_ms-04/photo_11-24.html

In the vehicle assembly building in Baiconur cosmodrome they are assembling a Progress MS cargo ferry for launch next monday to the ISS. This is where Soyuz and Progress are assembled. this has been done here for many years. You can see the Sequence of events on the Energia website for regular updates. Yellow structures/Frames to hold the Spacecraft.
But what is the 'Larger' Grey structure/Frame in the Middle of the building?
Anybody guess. . . 
Something I've been wondering.... Why have they spent so much effort trying to land these boosters? Wouldn't it be a lot more technically simple to engineer a system with some sort of reusable parachute / airbags to get them to the ground safely? I mean it's not as elegant but seems like it would accomplish the same result with a lot less effort and uncertainty.
What will they actually travel in to mars? What are the current ideas?
Is there a better method being researched on launching rockets? Perhaps cheaper and more convenient?

I am tearing my hair out trying to remember a rocket design that the US Army/Air Force looked into in the cold war. Can anyone help me?

It was designed as a suborbital spacecraft for transporting important personnel and equipment across the world for rapid response capability. It was single stage with fuel tanks at the side (three pairs) that dropped off and were recovered (the tanks had parachutes aboard) and the rest of the first stage did VTVL. It used its engines as a heat shield (if I remember correctly the term was like nozzle plug heat shield or something?). I feel as if the original name was something mathematical like Parallelogram or Rhombus, but neither of those give any results from a quick google. Can anyone help me out here?

That last moments of the video with female astronaut flying was very inspirational.
What an insane photo. I've never seen such an up close shot, and the lighting / angle of the sun helps put perspective into what I'm looking at otherwise it would just look like meaningless patterns to me. And are those the rings in the top right?  
  
Is this image doctored in any way or are those colors what you would see with your eye?
Jeez. Looks like Saturn must've gotten its own Third Impact some time ago.

What an age we live in to be able to not only witness such spectacular things, but also to just randomly go online and casually learn about them.
It's fascinating that there is a nearly perfect hexagon that naturally formed on such a large scale. Much less one so massive.
I didn't ever think I'd be able to see this. So friggin cool. Reminds me of in elementary school... The most in-depth idea I had of Saturn was making the solar system out of paper mache.
What is actually happening at the polar (red circle) is this kind of a hurricane? Like clouds circling around that spot? Does somebody know? 
First... you have to consider what is called the *Observational Sphere*.  That is the sphere surrounding you, with you in the center. Due to the speed of light, that sphere represents the maximum distance you can see in any direction.

You can't see farther because light past that point can't get to you.

Now... there is no center to the universe, but every point in the universe is the center of its own observational sphere.

So let's pretend that you are 1 light year to the right of me.  That means you can see 1 light year to your right, more than I can.  Likewise I can see 1 light year to my left, more than you can.

So... the universe is far larger than we can see (and getting larger due to accelerated expansion).

[But what shape is the universe?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe)  WMAP survey puts the universe as flat to a small degree of error, and thus most likely infinite.  However, there are a few other topological shapes the universe could be in which would not be infinite.

This actually boils down to what happens to parallel lines over a great (interstellar) distances.  Do they stay parallel?  Do they converge? Or do they diverge?

If they stay parallel, the universe is infinite and flat.  If they do not stay parallel, the universe is some other shape (eg., if they converge, the universe could be the topological surface of a sphere).

Also, if the universe is flat and infinite, then moving in a straight line will never take you back to your starting point. On the other hand, if the universe is the topological surface of a sphere, you would eventually return to your starting point.

It is possible that the universe is so huge that parallel lines appear to stay parallel within our observational sphere - but that would go against what most of physics has to say about the universe and how it formed.

As per how universes are formed. Popular hypothesis include:

* Collision of two 2D Branes in 10D+ string space (M-Theory)

* Special black hole hypothesis (certain types of black holes in 4D+ universes can create 3D+ universes)

* Quantum Foam / Holographic Universe Hypothesis (the universe is not as it appears but rather we live on a topological surface)

* Big Bounce (the universe expands and contracts in cycles)

* Computer simulation hypothesis (the universe is a computer simulation)

And as always, I like to remind people that there may be more than one way for a universe to form.
Check out Space Rip on YouTube, watching that late at night some times makes me question if life itself is real, it's mind boggling.
About the *why* questions you asked: I'm afraid nobody has the definitive answers you are looking for. But there are people who ask the same questions you do. Let me point you to read *"a Brief History of Time"* by Stephen Hawking.

> "Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe. **Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?**"

The 2014 Cosmos series touched on this somewhat.

However, strictly speaking, there's nothing we know in the laws of physics that would dictate an 'end' to space.  Assuming the Big Bang and cosmic expansion theories hold up, things will just keep travelling further and further apart until the basics of matter disintegrate (the heat death of the universe).  If space stopped, that would mean there was a wall of sorts... and that would have huge implications for both scientific theory and possibly theology.

If you could reach the edge of the universe in the first place, most likely you'd just keep going as there would literally be nothing to stop you.
Regardless if it does or doesn't, I highly doubt we as humans will ever know. It's extremely hard to even grasp the numbers involved in the distance we DO know it extends to. Light has been traveling for ~14 billion years at 9.4607 × 1012 km (nearly 6 trillion miles) PER YEAR! 

Even if our species ever makes it off this rock it's almost unthinkable to even make it out of just the space we CAN see.
There's definitely no ending, it's not like there's a massive wall or glass that you can't go further. Maybe it's a sphere, no one knows and pretty much impossible to find out. 
> Things exist because they are created.

Lets say *shaped* or *formed*.
Creation implies creation out of nothing

> Cars, phones etc all exist because someone created them.

Right.

> If you're like me and don't believe that an almighty God created the Earth, how and why does the universe exist?

two choices. ..material universe always existed for some reason.

Or something immaterial created the material universe.

This immaterial thing always existed for some reason.

Either way we can't escape eternity. 


> How far does space go, is it endless? 

If we know the curvature of space well and it is said to be flat then its infinite.How, I don't know.


Well even if space did have an end to it we will never know because we cant travel far enough to find out
>...how and why does the universe exist? 

Nobody knows... and you know that. Stop asking stuff that nobody has an answer to.

If the yellow is meant to resemble the sun i suggest making it white since that's the suns true color.

Explanation: How much mass do flocculent spirals hide? The featured true color image of flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 4414 was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope to help answer this question. The featured image was augmented with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Flocculent spirals -- galaxies without well-defined spiral arms -- are a quite common form of galaxy, and NGC 4414 is one of the closest. Stars and gas near the visible edge of spiral galaxies orbit the center so fast that the gravity from a large amount of unseen dark matter must be present to hold them together. Understanding the matter and dark matter distribution of NGC 4414 helps humanity calibrate the rest of the galaxy and, by deduction, flocculent spirals in general. Further, calibrating the distance to NGC 4414 helps humanity calibrate the cosmological distance scale of the entire visible universe. 
There I was, happy in my own little Mars-bound world. I was sure that Mars was the next logical step for mankind. It was obvious to me!

Then u/presidentme1 made a one sentence post on reddit that changed my mind forever. His argument, though brief, was sound and enthusiastic. That man changed my mind forever. Mars was no longer my dream. No, now I choose to go to the Moon.
i think a base of some kind on the moon might be a good investment if launching crafts to mars and titan would save fuel versus launching from earth.  not sure i see the point in another moon mission otherwise.
Having a Mars colony would be a good idea because if things go to shit on earth (climate change, nuclear war etc) humans might not go extinct. 
Why?! So expensive and no return of the invested money...And we've been there already.
Mars in the thing now.

[Another slow-mo video](https://twitter.com/DutchSpace/status/800394389218557952) from further out. 

A gorgeous video showing off the first moments of the Ariane 5 launch earlier this week in super slow motion. Watching the umbilicals drop away as the exhaust plume billows up and the rocket's engines come into view is very fascinating. I also like the clip I posted at the start of this comment, watching just how quickly the exhaust shoots out of the flame trench on the right.

The launch in question launched [4 Galileo satellites into orbit](http://spacenews.com/ariane-5-in-75th-straight-success-conducts-its-first-launch-of-europes-galileo-satellites/). These satellites make up part of Europe's navigation constellation that gives them independent access to satellite navigation services like America's GPS system. /r/Arianespace hosted a [launch thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arianespace/comments/5d6d5n/rarianespace_ariane_flight_va233_galileo_foc_1518/) filled with information about the launch. 
I'm sorry, all I got was that a former frozen hell became a nice meadow, then captions blocked out the text at the top.

Is there a way to watch the video without constant white text at the top of the video?
Bullshit video. Video preview shows 2000-2016 while actual video states 2010-2016. 

This video loses any credibility it had (if any) since it can't even keep the information straight

Seems like the ISS astronauts are a bit better at holding still in 0 g...

I certainly hope ESA and the other ISS partners can eventually work together in human spaceflight, either on ISS or a future Tiangong
> If EM Drive produces 1.2mN/kW of thrust. That seems like very little. How much thrust do we need to head to mars/moon?          

It's tiny relative to a traditional chemical rocket but a couple of orders of magnitude more than other "reactionless drives" like a photonic rocket.             

You need to get into LEO via traditional means and then any amount of constant thrust will get you to the Moon or Mars, it's just a question of time.    

Also given that no-one knows for sure how the thing works suggests to me that no-one knows for sure how to optimized the thrust - so maybe there's scope to increase it significantly.          

From what I understand, if it *does* work - and that's still a bit if - we have to take a hard look at the laws of physics as we understand them. Rather similar to if homeopathy was shown to work. 


I think that this kind of technology is less useful for a mars journey and more useful for something interstellar where a tiny acceleration can add up. A trip to Mars doesn't seem long enough to make use of such a small but fairly efficient thrust.

Edit: Just realised that the "journey to Mars in 70 days" comment was made by a particularly well qualified individual so maybe I should shut up
>How much thrust do you need to create artificial gravity of 1g due to acceleration? Is this just science fiction concept?

You need to be accelerating 9.8m/s all the time, which is completely impractical. 
> How much thrust do we need to head to mars/moon?

Depends how fast you want to get there.

> Is this just science fiction concept?

We don't have it yet do we ? So, yes.

> ... Mars in 70 day... How much acceleration do we need to make that happen?

A lot.

> What's our top speed around?

Voyager 1. 11 km/sec.


There has been a lot of hoopla over a minimal source of net thrust. Not sure what the hipster fascination is. It is similar to the Laithwaite anti-gravity machine which two opposing gyroscopes at high rotation rates do result in a small net lift force (it only reduced the weight of the box it was in).  
  
It is hard to determine what the appeal is? Insanely high thrust with fractional light velocity is possible now with fairly basic hardware technology we already have. A rocket gets its thrust from an explosion in the combustion chamber being turned into acceleration by the Venturi exit of the nozzle. The rocket exhaust is close to a plasma state and can be electromagnetohydrodynamically accelerated by large field coils around the nozzle bell. This is called Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) Propulsion. The problem is the electricity for the coils has to be generated, and the coil weight has to be added, including the type of power plant, generally a plutonium reactor generator. It isn't practical for a launch delivery system but as a third stage space craft in orbit, in preparation for destination insertion, the weight isn't a limitation. The big technical problem now are the coils, they can't be just copper, and silver might be a better conductor but not usable either. It will need to be a very strong composite superconductor and that technology might take awhile.
I think we've had better sources for this recently than the Huffington Post.  And if it works, it wouldn't "break the laws of physics" it would mean the laws of physics are different than we currently understand.
For those unfamiliar with what Peer Review is: it doesn't test the *validity* of claims, it checks whether the *methodology of testing* is flawed. The original [superluminal neutrino paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4897v1) is an example: methodologically sound, but later turned out to be incorrect due to equipment issues. 
Can someone  with relevant knowledge tell me how realistic it is to expect this thing to work well enough to be useful in space. 

If it works what does this mean for space travel? 
>**The next step for the EM Drive is for it to be tested in space**, which is scheduled to happen in the coming months, with plans to launch the first EM Drive having been made back in September.

This is basically what I am waiting for - let's see how it works in the field 
People are excited about this for the wrong reason.   
  
It's utility for space travel is much less significant than the fact that we can build a machine that does something, but we can't explain why.   
  
Then someone like Einstein comes along, and comes up with a theory that fits all the weird data.    
  
It's about time for us to peel another layer off of the universe.   
   
Edit - If you into learning how things work, check out /r/Skookum. I hope the mods won't mind the plug. 
Anyone got a tldr on what an em drive is?  Can't get the article to open on my tablet 
Its just a bug in the universe. Expect this exploit to be fixed in the next patch. 
Obviously there are still plenty of reasons to doubt to this, but HOLY SHIT, this is exciting. If the upcoming tests of this continue to verify the legitimacy of it, we are witnessing laws of physics being rewritten!
Damnit! I promised myself that I wouldn't get excited about this again. I'm excited again... 
I just impressed that we have so many people in the comment section of reddit that are smarter than the scientist at NASA.
So, according to one of the comments below, the efficiency of the drive is  1.2mN/kW - that is, you get 1.2 mN for every Kilowatt you give the drive.  

Where does all that energy go?  Is a Kilowatt dissipated from the drive as heat?  If so, we'll have to invent better radiators before we scale the drive to any significant size or it will melt whatever it is installed upon.  
This is the equivalent of standing on a hatch, pulling up and it opening. The forces should perfectly cancel out. 
Between this thing working and Trump winning, I'm just going to assume the massive computer that simulates the world we live in is running out of ram and is just outputting gibberish.
I don't know about you guys, but I'm certainly not reactionless!

...

I'll see myself out.

"Of course, this is just one hypothesis, based on one round of tests. There's a lot more work to be done before we can say for sure whether the EM Drive is really producing thrust – the team notes they that more research is needed to eliminate the possibility that thermal expansion could somehow be skewing the results. 

And even once that's confirmed, we'll then need to figure out exactly how the system works."

-(and it "works")
There needs to be a website that categorizes popular science into buckets like "peer reviewed - not duplicated" "peer reviewed and duplicated" "unreviewed + unduplicated" etc. and assigns credibility levels based on that info. 
Can we now stop dismissing this concept as 'pseudoscience'? How else do some people imagine truly new discoveries are made? I am happy that there are still some researchers out there trying new stuff, even when there's no reason to believe it should work. Hearing that discussions on r/Physics were deleted makes me sick. Finding results that fly into the face of established theories does not make it wrong, but we should discuss where the error lies.
I've been cautiously optimistic on this little gem for a few years now. My optimism was based on a gut feeling that there has to be a simple way to make a reactionless drive work, because I guess I just wanted there to be one. It opens up space exploration in so many ways. Optimize the shit out of this effect and you could have a very nice sub-light in-system drive. Now we just need to get cracking on that hyperspace drive.
I'm so excited ! I can finally return to my home planet and escape hu- I mean... This is great news !
How does the measured thrust vary with atmospheric pressure?

They tested it at 8 micro torr, and got consistent results at that pressure.  Increase the pressure slightly and see what happens.

My prediction is that measured thrust will increase as pressure increases, up to a peak, and then it will rapidly decrease to zero as the air becomes thicker.

Until they answer this question, the simplest explanation for the observed thrust is momentum exchange through impingement of hot surfaces by residual air molecules.  This is how a Crookes Radiometer works.

Admittedly, I skimmed through the paper.  Perhaps a more careful reading would discredit this hypothesis.
I remember this sub claiming it knew better than all the scientists last year
The paper does not say that "it works". It said there is a number of potential sources of an error, some of which had been ruled out with some degree of certainty, while others (like thermal effects) cannot be ruled out directly and may only be assessed indirectly with a dodgy certainty level.

Which means - keep looking, the error is somewhere out there. Nothing to get excited about.
If it really works, it won't be long before DARPA starts to look at how to use it as a weapon.
If I understand things correctly, this thing heats up quite significantly. If one side heats up more than the other, it would emit more black body radiation in that direction. Wouldn't that explain a thrust?
If NASA used such rigorous methods to detect such a small amount of thrust, then how was the inventor in 1999 able to detect it was capable of producing thrust? Did he have his connected to a small power plant?
Since on paper it's not supposed to work, do you know how the inventor came up with it in the first place?
For me, the most exciting part about this is "Hey, it works, but we don't know why."
Imagine what insights this technology has stumbled upon!
Finally.  I remember seeing this 6 years ago and Reddit was shitting all over it. Is Reddit ever tired of being wrong?
What if the EM drive does work but does not work according to newton's law? Would that require a reevaluation of our understanding of the laws of physics or would we just consider this a very rare exception to that law?
Does anybody know why this paper isn't behind a paywall? I just clicked on the link and viewed it. So...refreshing.
I was disappointed that the AIAA Journal of Propulsion and Power peer review did not require that this paper detail and reference the test history of this type of device.  The fact that the Chinese measured 720mN of thrust for a 2.5 kW power input is very interesting. This article claims a thrust to power of 1.2 +/- 0.1 mN/kW, yet the Chinese researchers see about 288 mN/kW ... which is over 240 times higher. There are several other examples of test results in the reference that could have been discussed. Whether these difference is due to a better thruster design, or a much worse measurement uncertainty, some discussion of the range of performance results would seem to be needed in a peer reviewed paper that is proposing new physics. ...http://emdrive.com/
What I find interesting about the EM drive is that we've had the tech necessary to make them since the 1950s, yet we've only now discovered this effect (assuming it actually works)  All you need is a microwave oven and some copper.  Makes you wonder what other technologies we've "missed".
Don't get how everyone is being so negative about the low thrust output of this thing (assuming it actually works). The Newcomen steam engine (original piston steam engine) was 0.5 % efficient, compared to the the record 48% efficient steam turbine we have today. This is prototype stage, we don't even have an understanding of how it might be working, much less any idea of what the upper limits of efficiency or thrust might be. How about a little optimism, people? Also, even if what this paper claims is as good as it gets, saying an ion thruster is better because it gets more thrust with the same power input is asinine, it's the elimination of the need for propellant/reaction mass that's the true holy grail. 
Hmm, 1.2mN/kW, not much bang for your buck!

>But the Hall thruster requires heavy rocket fuel, and that extra weight could offset the higher thrust, the team concludes.

Whatever the source of fuel you still need it for that kW of energy.

>"A number of error sources were considered and discussed."

I expect that they will be determined to be the 'cause' of this 'thrust', by advice is 'don't get your hopes up guys'. 
Calling it: Dielectrophoretic force on the surrounding environment.

Won't work in space unless next to another object.

I hope I'm wrong though!


Please get rid of the misleading headline. It has not been shown to work. That is not what the peer review established.
of course there are some who doubt.... [edit -  including me..] but the good thing about science is that it works (or doesn't, i guess) regardless of our beliefs (as N.dG.T says :)

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/EmDrive#A_history_of_ever-shrinking_effects
On this topic, there is a BBC horizon episode called Project Greenlight. It's quite good, if this type of stuff interest's you, look it up.
Welp, that's an engine with a specific impulse that gets better the more you use it! It tends towards infinity! It has infinite potential, as long as you can gather energy, you can row against the vacuum. It's huge! We will finally have probes that can go to the inner solar system in much less time. You just need some solar panels and there you have your energy.
The thing that bothers me is what is it pushing and against what? If this damn thing works, why?
Something nobody has explained yet. Ok sure lets say this works. How did someone conceptualize this in the first place?
Well color me delighted, the damn thing actually works.   Now come the part where we optimise the effect and hopefully we can figure what is actually happening from that process.
I think we can rule out magnetic interaction the output power kw has been consistent in multiple locations. The magnetic field is not constant. Perhaps scientist in Brazil where there's a weaker field could run the tests and see. 
I find it both odd and insane that we can somehow produce a drive that defies physics and works (As far as this article is concerned) yet we don't even know how it works.
I am a geek, not a super geek, but a geek all the same, this blows my mind, 
All I have to say is HOOOOOOOLEEEEEE FUCK. I expected this to be debunked right away. Now were in for test after test that may upend what we know about physics. I love life for things like this. Born too late to explore the world and born too early to explore space but I may be around to see the drive that enables it.
If there's no science to back it up, what on earth inspired Roger Shawyer to design such a contraption? It seems inconceivable to me that the concept has made it even this far in the face of such scrutiny. I do wish the review process wasn't quite so glacial. Exciting!
Why is it so difficult to measure thust in this case?. For example, Cavendish measured the attractive gravitational force between laboratory objects by having the force twist a thread. He was able to do this many decades ago with much cruder instruments to the satisfaction of the entire physics establishment, probably with only a tiny fraction of the budget and resources. 

In addition, the article mentions that the thrust of a "light" sail is an order of magnitude smaller than the em  thruster, yet light sail thrust is accepted. I also didn't understand why light sails have thrust measured in units of N/kW. Why do light sails require energy?  I mean the light energy is being harvested not generated by the sail, right?  It's not a consumable like the fuel used to power a microwave source. Or are they thinking of harvesting ambient light from a star or stars like the sun , converting it to microwaves, powering the em drive and thereby generating more thrust than the light sail. 

I need an em drive tutorial and a tutorial on  the difficulty of measuring its thrust. 
Just for the sake of curiosity I calculated what kind of velocity an engine like this could generate given our current technology. I read an article recently that China has developed a nuclear reactor that fits in a shipping container and generates 10 megawatts of power. The article didn't mention weight so I assumed an average density of 1 gram/cc (same as water). The size of the reactor is 20ft x 8ft x 8ft, providing a total mass of about 36 tons.

So assume you take this reactor and strap a (weightless) EM drive to it, get it into orbit, and then fire it up. It's not going to accelerate very quickly:

(1.2 millinewtons / kilowatt) * (10,000 kilowatts) / (36 tons)

= 0.00033 m / s^2 

However, give it ten years to accelerate:

0.00033 m / s^2 * 10 years 

= 104 km / s

Okay, that's not going to get us to Alpha Centauri. But it's much faster than any of our interplanetary probes, by a factor of about 5, and potentially the reactor could work for longer than 10 years. So if it works, it makes exploring the outer reaches of our solar system much easier. 
Does the thrust have anything to do with interaction with earth's magnetic poles?
Another thing that is lacking in the paper is a discussion on test results around the world of similar devices. To me, the fact that the Chinese measured 720mN of thrust for a 2.5 kW power input is very interesting. The AIAA Journal of Propulsion and Power article claims a thrust to power of 1.2 +/- 0.1 mN/kW, yet the [Chinese researchers](http://emdrive.com/) see about 288 mN/kW ... which is over 240 times higher.  There are several other examples of test results in the reference that could have been discussed.  Whether these difference is due to a better thruster design, or a much worse measurement uncertainty, some discussion of the range of performance results would seem to be needed in a peer reviewed paper that is proposing new physics.
So, I want to set aside, for a moment, whether the results are legitimate. My understanding is that for 1000 watts (1 kW) of input power, the device produces 1.2 milliNewtons of thrust. Which seems a tiny number but apparently beats solar sails, so hey. The result may break our understanding of physics, but no matter, it sounds like I still need to pour a continuous 1000 W into the EM drive to get that thrust. 

How does that help in space? Where would the power even come from? So, I don't need heavy rocket fuel, which is good, but still need some source of power in a vaccuum. Nuclear reactor?
This technology is like a transistor for our earth exert galactic scale potential.
There's a lot of (rightly) skeptical responses here, but it's important to realize that this is still an exciting development because even if we eventually find that it's nothing but experimental error or some mundane explanation, that information still helps narrow down things that WON'T get us where we want.  In other words, future research can theoretically become more focused and, hopefully, fruitful as a result.

Put another way: everybody wants a means to travel interstellar distances in a single human lifetime, and even if this doesn't wind up being the discovery that allows that it's still a step that may help get us to that goal faster if it means future experiments can be run more efficiently because they account for whatever mistake or mundane effect we learn was at play here.

Science is iterative and even "bad" results help in the long run, to put it succinctly.
The article reads as appropriately restrained, to me. The EM drive is such an extraordinary claim that, only because the testing has been so careful, can it be considered as, "Possibly valid." Physics has not had a validated moment like this in almost 100 years, (dark matter and dark energy are still highly provisional) but relativity and quantum mechanics were such world changing paradigm shifts that we pride ourselves on being a little bit more open minded than geology or paleontology.
I think the thing that still really needs to be proved is that this technology scales. Producing miniscule forces in the lab is interesting (see: [the casimir effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect)), but there are lots of things that work counterintuitively at small scales. To make something useful, it still needs to be proved that pumping kilowatts of power in actually does produce millinewtons of thrust.
Does it ACTUALLY break the laws of physics or have they not figured out yet how it works WITHOUT breaking the laws of physics?
Guys, I'm Russian physicist and all this excitement about EmDrive is one huge mistake. It just can't work as described and it won't work in space of course. I don't think Harold White made fake research, but I'm sure that this propulsion has some other reasons. Almost all the scientists are very sceptical about this.
Ok I'll say it.

They measured thrust. But the thrust they measured was close to their margin of error, meaning it is not as likely to have measured real thrust. 

The EM Drive is an extraordinary claim and extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence which this isn't. It will be published because it is a scientific approach to examining this claim, but that doesn't mean it works.

I'll start by downvoting myself.
This is just sensationalist. AIAA still has to officially publish this - not a 'leak' being trumpeted around by ScienceAlert, which by itself doesn't mean...anything, really. And the Cannae Drive is being pushed into space on a cube sat by Guido Fetta of Cannae Inc, NOT NASA; with NO news from that, either.

So no, for now, it's not published (maybe it will in Decemember), nor does it 'work'.

I, for one, will believe any of this psuedoscientific hogwash when it comes from official, mainline sources with hard tests in the field; not peddling by a site for clicks.
/r/titlegore

It's not "true"

Some peer scientists don't see a problem with the methodology and conclusions

That doesn't mean it's "true". It can all be perfectly wrong, it's just some people doesn't see why.
I've still seen no even *remotely* plausible argument that a reactionless drive  would not, on the happy side, result in a perpetual-motion machine (put it on a stick spinning around a dynamo with wires going from the middle to the rim... faster and faster and faster, here comes the Oberth Effect... Yay! Infinite energy!) or, of course, [inexpensive planet-crackers](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/reactionlessdrive.php).

(Also, if it's reversible in the way it's supposed to be, where it gives you a reactionless acceleration in exchange for power, but can also give you power in exchange for an acceleration... can't you just sit it on the ground and get power from it for free?)

None of it makes any sense. All of physics, with all of its verified experiments, would have to be torn down *and somehow reconstructed with all of those experiments working out the same way*, for this to be a thing.

Workable fusion power plants? That, I can believe. Reactionless drives, though...?

If they work, it's a disaster for science, and also for the human race, as soon as someone sends a brick with an RTG or something powering the reactionless drive on it out and out and out, and then it turns around and comes back, and back, and back...
This is potentially the most influential discovery of man that we are witnessing. 

If this works it has unending implications in physics and travel, including energy. This could fundamentally shake the human future. If it works. Maybe. 
If the universe is a simulation, then this seems like the first major exploit found in the code. Speedrunners will have a field day shaving seconds off of their runs.
I feel like this thing is going to answer a lot of questions in the real of quantum physics where we say "oh the rules break down here" because of the forces involved in EM drive.  Just a hunch, but that's my hunch.
At last, it made it to the front page, now there can be some meaningful debate about this. It's been almost 2 weeks that the article was leaked. 

I'm very interested to see where this leads us. This experiment is already a reproduction of others' results (see [Shawyer's website](http://emdrive.com/) ) albeit unpublished results. I hope that some other public research team look into it and try to reproduce the phenomenon again and again, especially in orbit. If this works, we may have unlocked **one** of the keys to interstellar travel. We may even discover a new physics !

Let's see how it will go.
Physicists are always saying things like "We don't even know what we don't know yet" But we do know this cannot work?
R/physics mods sound like the kind of scientist that don't want to hear about any different theory then the one they believe in even if that means abusing heir power to silence the opposition...

Some things don't change...
I'm still not buying it. To be honest, I probably never will. I have a very hard time with the fact that someone built this thing without knowing how it worked (and seemingly with a very flawed understanding of physics as a whole) and just *happened* to create a machine that violates known basic laws of the universe. It seems much more likely to me that there's some unaccounted for variable nobody has thought of yet.

Or, to explain it again, he set out to break the laws of physics because he didn't understand them, then did. When someone explained that his understanding was wrong he agreed, shrugged and said "yeah, but it works."

I could walk into a lab tomorrow with a wooden door and claim that I'd discovered burning it could violate physics but I don't know how. The complexity of the experiment might take decades to prove me wrong even though everyone knows I am.
If this turns out to be legit, we can add "defied some of the known fundamental laws of physics" to the list of crazy things that happened in 2016

EDIT: found the cynical phycisist.
What people forget to mention is that the engine design is very very simple. Compared to a conventional rocket is almost comparing a bicycle with a tesla. This engine, if proven true, will open up the galaxy for us humans. We need more research though and a test in space.
I'm kinda excited about the possibility of being able to [get to Alpha & Proxima Centauri in 10 years with a superconducting version of the EmDrive](http://www.nextbigfuture.com/2015/04/emdrive-roger-shawyer-believes-midterm.html). Especially because [there is planet in the habitable zone around Proxima Centauri.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/earth-mass-planet-proxima-centauri-habitable-space-science/)

In about the same amount of time it took to launch New Horizons from Earth and do a flyby of Pluto, we might be able to launch a probe with an EmDrive towards Proxima Centauri b, and possibly find new life there.
One thing that is hard to swallow: The guy who invented didn't explain it why. He claim he does, but his papers weren't peer reviewed and I don't trust that (sorry, university made me that way :(!). And with our current knowledge even we currently don't know why.

This is very counter intuitive, based on every other invention our species had. First we discover the principle, then people that are more or less comfortable with it understand how you turn A to B and make a invention that uses these principles.

It is very hard for me to accept that one guy converted non principles to practicality.

How can someone invent the television before the electricity? 

It is very similar to people who invent perpetual motion machines. They don't know the principles, just have a general idea that they think is relevant (although it isn't). 

**EDIT** It seems that I was wrong. I'll keep this comment though, since it generated a discussion below :)
Following this through in my head I think the weirdest part is that it is so self contained, as far as I can tell they could take it up to the ISS and as long as it's bolted down to something and powered it could potentially move the space station... they don't need to make a hole and point it out the back of the ISS, it just kinda works... if they want to go in another direction just turn the drive around... it's very unintuitive and bizarre in its perfectness... I really hope it works, and if it does it is going to be astronomically game changing once the inevitable resources are allocated to improving it and making it more efficient...
So what is the "fuel"?  It bounces microwaves around in a cone to generate thrust at 1.2 millinewtons per kilowatt, but how are these kilowatts being produced?  Does it just need the initial production of the microwaves and they just bounce indefinitely from there?

Please excuse my ignorance, it's been 10-15 years since I've had any formal education on physics.
I note that they only did something like 16 runs all up, and they didn't last very long. 
Could this be situated inside the space craft, allowing for maintenance is needed? I'm assuming the microwaves are contained within the conical vessel, so this should be safe to be around whilst in use, yes? How big would one have to be to hold the ISS in its orbit? 
Isn't this a really big deal? I'm pretty sure this is that propulsion system that creates push without doing shit with quantum mechanics nonsense or something. Free Energy?
As a science-idiot can somebody tell me if this force (measured in a vacuum) would be strong enough to push against earth's gravity ?

Could it, for example, propel an adult human ?

OK. Hoverboard ! There I said it. Do we get hoverboards or what ? Let's be honest..it's all we really care about.

I know this isn't thinking big, but it would certainly make travel to the moon incredibly quick and efficient (3.5-4hrs) Think about launching several hundred tons of payloads into space with conventional rockets and then somewhat lasooing them together and having an EM Drive do the work of transporting them to a Permanent moon base, where contruction can be done in orbit of the first official Starships for humanity. 

Granted this sounds all scify-ish and it's not proven yet, nor do we have an Answer for the Inertia problem that's bound to happen even at gradual increases in speed, but it is a Giant skip, leap and jump for mankind, especially since the stagnation period post moon landing (unmanned exploration aside of course)

I think we are still many hundreds of years from solving the difficulty of having large payloads achieve escape velocity on earth, and obviously shielding of sorts for micrometeorites etc, then theres the gravity problem and inertial "dampening" problem but they are just a matter of time. Once we master construction in a low G or micro G environment, we could send hundreds of people out for long periods of time for Study and research in our solar system, and as a fan of SGU and someone who would have cut off a non-essential body part to be on a ship like destiny, this has me rather excited!

Room temp Superconductivity or Fusion would provide essentially limitless energy for the EM drive, the new workhorse of inter planetary and intersteller travel....

Ah don't we live in exciting times.
Computers people still don't trust them or the K there high tech listening devices placed by the government 
not sure that's the most reputable website, and it looks like they are missing a lot of key issues regarding peer-review, scientific testing, etc. but it sounds exciting!
Don't you mean they don't check soundness, they just check methodological validity?
peer review is a good step- the next test is someone having enough faith to pony up some money to build one. Once one is built and we get some field test data.
its flawed.?! darn... thought we were getting close to making Gundams...
It's cresting thrust and people know that already, right? I don't understand why people are inclined to believe that it doesn't work because we don't understand it. If it's creating thrust than it does, indeed, work. People seem to think it's a magic trick or something. 
Goddamn. I mean I know there's a shit ton of testing and prototyping they still need to do in order to try and deploy one in space and see if it works in orbit but having something of this magnitude happen just less than 2 weeks after Donald Trump got elected, my head is swooning. 
I hope they play Sugar Ray "I just want to fly" when they launch one of these.
Chinese has been claiming they proved Roger Shawyer's drive since 2008, for some reason it took NASA till 2013 to take notice. 

https://www.wired.com/2008/09/chinese-buildin/
Why are people doubting the EM drive so much? It's had promising tests. If there was one thing to doubt and label as impossible, that would have been the lead scientist contribution to the sensationalism that is Alcubierre's drive, a premise parting  from the made up physics of exotic negative energy density. It's like trying to solve a maze puzzle adding as part of the solution the premise that you can skip a wall or two - maybe it's a solution to the new rules you've made up, but it's not in any way a solution within the constraints of said puzzle in the first place.
Seems like the only thing to do now to prove if this thing works or not is just make one and send it to space and fire it up. I know it's an expensive endeavor but there has to be a light proof of concept that could be tested, right? Thinking just a battery, engine, and radio and see what happens. Of course we'd probably strap two million dollars worth of sensors on it because... science, but still. 
People need to stop using the word impossible, nothing is imossible, only improbable

Having read but only partly understood the paper, can someone please explain how they have controlled for magnetic effects I.e. whether the thrust could be due to an interaction with the earth's magnetic field?
Does anyone know which direction it supposedly produces thrust in? 
It obviously looks like a rocket nozzle, but maybe it's counter intuitive.
I saw that thing once.
If not that same device then one just like it.
It is at NASA Langley research center in the lobby of a building they use for training and orientation. 
I work for a federal facilities contractor. My boss and I stood there and stared at it for five minutes.  
I explained what it was as best I could but I don't think he really got much. He's a businessman, not a nerd. That's why I work for him.
Great! Makes me wonder what other undiscovered mechanisms there are for converting energy directly into desirable physics. We should start thinking about how to store and use the excess energy we capture from space, since it seems we won't be able to hold ourselves back. We could use this technology to stabilize the earth's orbit or even pilot the entire planet! It's as though we have just gained traction in space for the first time! Very exciting.
If it's such a mystery and hard to correctly test, can't they just "field test" it in space?
So let me get this straight - if this turns out to be for real - will we see spaceships take off into space without those loud, huge rockets they use today for thrust? Like, will it just be a huge cylinder that levitates quietly up into the air, rapidly?

Pretty dope.
Quick silly question. Say the drive works and we can use it  for space travel.

The power source would likely be solar. Strap some big ass panels, get the power to have acceleration. But as we get further from the sun, the power we get is lowered. This means that by the time we have reached Mars, sun power would be 1/2 of what we have at departure.

How do we slow down with 1/2 the power? Does it mean we need to start slowing down after 1/3 of the trip?
> But, there's a not-small problem with the system. It defies Newton's third law, which states that everything must have an equal and opposite reaction.

Whenever you see this in an article about the EM drive, you can be certain the writer doesn't know shit and is just repeating what other writers put in their articles. 
>A vacuum test campaign evaluating the impulsive thrust performance of a tapered radio-frequency test article excited in the transverse magnitude 212 mode at 1937 MHz has been completed.

Shouldn't this be Transverse Magnetic and not transverse magnitude? IE TM 212 mode? I'm an electrical engineer, but it's been a while since I've dealt with RF.
Can't they build a small scale engine and simply launch it in space and just try it there? 
How many peer reviews have been posted so far?
How many says yes?

I'm so confused. Can somebody explain to me: 

1. What is an EM Drive?

2. How fast would be able to travel with it compared to standard rockets?

3. Does it work?
I'm wondering whether this EM Drive has gotten past significant hurdles or if it just seems that way due to the Reddit bubble in which I always encounter it. Is it considered a big deal yet, or is it meeting a great deal of skepticism out in the real world? Yes, I realize the irony of asking that question on Reddit.
I'm not very familiar with thrust and it's constituent variables but isn't 1.2mN an incredibly small amount of force to be exerted per kilowatt? Can someone explain this a little more in detail. Although I understand it is a remarkable observation since there is no fuel being burnt in the process. 
So this was just theoretically thought up, and then after testing it, it worked.

Isn't it normally the other way around and who thought this up? 
I love all this EM Drive stuff. It's exciting. 

Yet I literally understand nothing about it. I think that makes me just as qualified as anyone else? Lol. 

So like, if this is a thing.. like an actual thing now, WHERE THE FUCK DID IT COME FROM? We dunno what it can do, or how it works.. fair enough, but it didn't just turn up in an engineers lab one day?? 
So what exactly does this device do? it is exciting particles and directing them to a specific vector?
Why aren't NASA and/or Johnson Space Center press officers promoting this? Who is funding it?
This is completely useless until it's actually tested in space, the numbers are so small that I don't think they'll be able to accurately test it on ground.
Totally off topic, but the fact it says 'IT' instead of 'It' is telling of OP.
Also, posting space news.
So looks like the possibility of an Aether is not yet out of the question, as many scientist have wanted to make us believe.
As far as my rudimentary understanding goes, mass and energy are interchangeable to an extent, (that's how nuclear bombs work, right?)  If electricity is used in this propulsion system, wouldn't the expenditure of energy=expenditure of some equivalent amount of mass, therefore making it not propellant-less and not impossible? 
I've been reading these comments for about 20 minutes now.. Reddit quickly turned into a physics class with rocket scientists everywhere
I'm not able to access it on phone. Does anyone know whether they tested it yet with another sort or radiation than microwave? If not, why not?
I was reading the Discussion section of the article and it was proposing that the thruster is pushing off quantum vacuum fluctuations. Hypothetically, this would be generating a volumetric body force and movement in one direction and a wake in the quantum vacuum moving in the opposite direction.

Can anyone on here provide more detail than what's given in the paper for pilot-wave theory and how it's linked to the possibility of the vacuum acting as a dynamic medium?

Disclaimer: I understand that this is all hypothesis, and that von Neumann and others published impossibility proofs against pilot-wave theory half a century ago.
Okay why is /r/space more skeptical and reasonable than /r/science. /r/science is all "quantum vacuum state!", "pilot wave phenomena!", or "quantum virtual particles!"  without understanding that those are ways to understand and do the math and not physical phenomena how you imagine it on the macro scale.
The pic looks fake, it's a funnel-shaped copper sheeting bolted with local hardware fasteners.
"Amazing" that the physics seems to work out so that displacement due to the alleged reactionless force is the same magnitude as the operation induced drift ... Missing from the paper is any indication that the device will be independently tested by national experts in the field of low thrust electric propulsion devices (e.g. [NASA Glenn Electric Propulsion Laboratory](https://facilities.grc.nasa.gov/epl/gallery.html)). The Discussion vaguely describes a physical model for the device's operation and then fails to discuss a theoretical quantification of the proposed force or fundamental validation tests.  Without some math behind it, throwing the pilot wave / Bell inequality references into the paper doesn't do much more than say that we don't fully understand physics, so if we have a measurement we can't explain, it might be new physics.
I'm no scientist , but in my feeble mind , but they are saying it doesn't make sense that it works because it doesn't push anything out (which violates newtons 3rd law) but if it is using EM to propel isn't it working like a magnet ? A magnet doesn't push anything out but can be used to propel things . By all means tell me I'm wrong and ignorant but it makes sense in my head . 
This, if it pans out, would literally radicalize modern space travel and human colonization efforts, IMAGINE IT, not living in some random shit time on earth, BUT AT THE GREAT COLONIZATION DAWN OF HUMANITY INTO SCI FI (ok now I'll be realistic and say this probably won't come to fruition but still I know you all feel it, deep down if your balls and lady balls). 


Edit: language 
The laws of physics being what they are, I wouldn't hold my breath on this one.
“IT's Official: NASA's Peer-Reviewed EM Drive Paper Has Finally Been Published (and it works)”
What are the chances,? That confronted by a possible paradox which suggests the scientific belief system is also nothing more than yet another human construct. Funds will begin to flow into the investigation of that equally preposterous concept, cold fusion.

 I'm no scientist but i reckon this dude just invented the propulsion system for the BTTF Hoverboard.  (Edit): Based on inventors comments on its potential applications not this article
Sad thing is, when I see a headline like this, I go to the comments first to see why it actually doesn't work
> ...and it works

Okay, I think it's time I quit using Reddit. Misinformation, disinformation, ignorance: we have then in abundance. I remember when Reddit used to be the first place to go for news and technology. Now it is quickly becoming the last place to go for content. 
"The scientific community is also notoriously unconvinced about the propulsion system – just yesterday a Motherboard article on the EM Drive was deleted by the moderators of the popular subreddit r/Physics because they "consider the EM Drive to be unscientific"."

Its not scientific? Wtf Reddit.
Saw headline. Told my wife to pack her bags were going to Mars. Open thread see everyone questions article. Time to unpack bags.
When I see " it violates the [insert number] law of [insert name]" I always wonder why no one is even considering that the law may be wrong.


Is there a reason for this?
I feel like this is something that should be said. There is a misconception here about how a propulsion system can generate thrust. Everyone first says, "this is impossible because there is no mass ejected from any orifice on the EM drive". Well there doesn't have to be. If you conduct a control volume analysis (how one actually derives the rocket thrust equation) on this system, you will find that the reaction force on the control volume (which is equal and opposite on the EM cavity) is a summation of the **time rate of change of momentum within the control volume (EM cavity) plus the net momentum flux through the control surfaces of the control volume**. Obviously, since the EM cavity is a closed system, there is no momentum flux through the control surfaces surrounding the cavity, and the net momentum flux through the control surfaces is zero. **But everyone forgets the full linear momentum equation also contains an unsteady momentum term. Hence, without breaking Newtonian physics, and for a real physical net force to be measured, there must be an unsteady momentum component within the cavity.** An example of this thrust component can be observed when shooting a rifle. From high speed videos of someone shooting a rifle, you will notice the rifle is plowing into their shoulder prior to anything leaving the barrel of the rifle. That force is generated by the unsteady momentum within the rifle. The force that comes after that is the exhaust products of combustion leaving the barrel, which is then momentum flux and the thrust we observe with rockets. 
It was never NASA's, and no this is still not enough evidence to say it works..

Awesome. It would be so freakin' funny if a Mars base was built under Trump because of this. Imagine the salt.

Why is this garbage being upvoted? It's not actually peer reviewed by physicists, and it's pretty obvious their experimental methodology is deeply flawed. It's an outright scam at this point.


For me, the most exciting part about this is "Hey, it works, but we don't know why."
Imagine what insights this technology has stumbled upon!

Here is a video demonstrating it in 2006. You see it start to move 1min into the video https://youtu.be/nFa90WBNGJU
Couldn't this be tested by just... putting the EM drive on wheels?

I mean, I'm confused as to what is difficult to test here I guess.
Question, if this requires no propellant and assuming that it has a power source that could last long enough, could this engine reach the speed of light?

IE: At a force of 1.2 mN/kE over 95 years = speed of light?
I thought they already took this into space, tested it and it worked?

No?
NASA just spent billions to create a $5 solar vane and the same people gushing over this out of vainglorious conceit are the same ones criticizing the idea that public spending on science should be cut.

Think about that for a moment.

NASA just started asking for suggestions to "cut costs" on the Orion program. One of the things they're considering is using a private contractor for complete development.

I think it's a pretty safe bet that Orion never flies as set out in the planning stages.
You have your feet on the ground and in the heavens at the same time. 
[Those error bars.](http://imgur.com/BS48420) Also, basically all the time people only talk about this violating Newtons third law, which I think is a broad mischaraterization. If conservation of momentum is violated, then it immediatly follows from Nother's theorem that translational symmetry is violated and thus the lorentz-transformations as well as special relativity are violated. But since we know pretty damn good that those hold within the margin of error, it is way, way more likely that something with the experiment isn't quite right.

I believe its a comet. One was captured by SOHO very recently in a similar picture. I'll do an edit if I can find it but its on a thread here too somewhere.

Edit: I cant find the post on here where I saw it, but a google search found [this](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2016/esa-nasa-s-soho-sees-bright-sungrazer-comet) which I think is the same time/images.
Budget? For $280 there's the Orion XT6, for $400 there's the Zhumell Z8. The XT6 is the cheapest telescope I'd recommend. Below that budget, get some 10x50 binoculars.
i think starting with a good pair of binoculars is a good idea.  also, see if you can find a local astronomical society.  some of them will put on community outreach events that are open to the public.  that would be a good way for you to look through some telescopes and talk to some people about gear.
[Watch this series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL), you'll love it.
Phobos or Deimos will probably be next, and one or both of them may even happened before Mars.  SpaceX is targeting a direct flight to Mars, Lockheed is pushing to get a Mars orbit-only contract and one of the moons would be more akin to a docking maneuver than a 'landing' because of their low mass.

So it depends on who gets there first.  If SpaceX, then Mars followed by the moons.  If Old Aerospace, then the other way around I bet.
I enjoyed the first part (orbiting) way more than the second (inside) though the rack of camera gear was impressive. Is the first part real? Just wondering how they got the space station ahead of the observer.
Looks cool, but I think you need a 360-degree capable IMAX theater to properly enjoy this.
I watched it on Nasa tv before I had to switch over to Cartoon network because my mom said it was too boring. :(
This first article focuses on the ongoing efforts of Russian and Indian rocket vehicle manufacturers and operators. The next issue in this series will cover current and in-development rockets from the various European entities and JAXA.

Explanation: How much mass do flocculent spirals hide? The featured true color image of flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 4414 was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope to help answer this question. The featured image was augmented with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Flocculent spirals -- galaxies without well-defined spiral arms -- are a quite common form of galaxy, and NGC 4414 is one of the closest. Stars and gas near the visible edge of spiral galaxies orbit the center so fast that the gravity from a large amount of unseen dark matter must be present to hold them together. Understanding the matter and dark matter distribution of NGC 4414 helps humanity calibrate the rest of the galaxy and, by deduction, flocculent spirals in general. Further, calibrating the distance to NGC 4414 helps humanity calibrate the cosmological distance scale of the entire visible universe.

Oh wow what a picture! Even the cloud cover helped you get some depth and framing. How did you get so close?
They should make cars too.  Tesla style.  It could be a nice bump in funding and who wouldn't want a car made by NASA.  Sorry I'm a little buzzed it's Fri night maybe it's a terrible idea. 
When do we get to see the incredible sunset? Can't wait, looks so promising.
I love how they have the flag facing down like they're moving toward the sky 
This looks like it'd be a cool building to explore if it were in Fallout.
Cocoa has some decent restaurants. Enjoy your time in the spacecoast and don't stay. 
Been there. That's the largest American flag I have ever and probably will ever see.
In the right is, I think, the SLS launch tower.  I was there a few weeks ago, they're building it so the mobile launch platform can drive under it, connect up, then trundle into the VAB for final integration of the rocket.
Read it as "becomes" and didn't question it - ships are called "she" in space too, right? The ISS isn't the oldest though. I need coffee.
No, we still get useful data from experiments conducted there and it provides opportunity for peaceful cooperation between nations. It is humanity crowning achievement and is pocket change to maintain compared to military expenditures.
But... I love tracking it online and looking at it with my naked eyes.
I do think national projects like that with huge legacy potential would be something Trump would be keen on doing. I know Trump wants to spend big money on infrastructure, so what's a few extra billion for NASA to build a moon base? 
Dont tink small. Mars, not Moon. Interplanetary travel. 

Trump will bring the next step in civilization.
Is there a compelling reason to return to the moon? There are so many much more interesting places within reach. 
When the GOP says things like this nowadays, I can't help but think that they're trying to micromanage NASA into moving away from climate science. Then again, Rep. Jim Bridenstine (OK-R) [has a bill currently in the House](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4945/text) that seems ok in that regard, or maybe I'm too dumb to read legalese.

Nothing will get done under this president. 

I have a feeling  that he thinks the earth is flat and space doesn't really exist.
That's nice and all. So what happens to that Mars mission they've been planning? 

Or is all that work just going to be scrapped with NASA starting all over again but with the moon instead. And then presumably if another administration comes in four years time they can scrap that project and get NASA to start again with something else instead.

Perhaphs an organisation that works on projects that take decades to complete shouldn't be micromanaged by politicans that come and go every four to eight years, just a thought.
Any survey you were looking for in particular?

From a quick search:

Whew. They delayed to the very end of the launch window to give the eastern range, which handles downrange telemetry and communications, time to resolve an issue. Range is now go.

Launch at 6:42pm EST.
Anywhere to watch it without flash required? All of the Ustream.tv feeds (what Nasa is using) requires flash. Would love something with HTML5
Resubmitted, switched to public channel from media channel. Posted schedules and actual schedules were backwards, so the full launch coverage will be on this channel instead.
The fuck was that? 30 secs of coverage? Space x knows how to do a launch

Sitting in the Orlando airport right now. Just lost sight of it out the window! Wish I was closer but still cool to see. 
I noticed [something](http://puu.sh/snVa6/6df24191cc.jpg) was still stuck to the fairing after lift off. Is this suppose to be like this? https://twitter.com/NASA/status/800122399098179585

Providing a source and at least some science context would go a long way towards getting upvoted. 
Not OP, but I know people are going to complain/downvote because this is just an artists conception. But it should be known that 55 Cancri E is actually the only rocky planet where we actually have a good idea of what's going on at the surface-oceans of lava on the warm side, and frequent volcanic eruptions. So this isn't far off

Is this from [space engine](http://en.spaceengine.org/)? Or did you create this yourself? If so, what 3d application did you use?
Seems nice and temperate. A bit hot for my taste though. 

Somebody pass me a sombrero.
What do you think the chances are that your post will get as many upvotes as the link to the paper did earlier?
The technology that's invented from trying to do things like go to the moon, or building a colony on Mars benefits everyone in the entire world.
Because there's something like a 50% return on every single dollar spent in the space industry. The very challenge of such exploration forces innovation in software, hardware, agricultural and biological science that rapidly filters down into everyday life.


The fundamental research of today is the application of 10-50 years in the future. History is full of examples of fundamental research where no one could even imagine an application - and today, we all use products that would be impossible without this research.
Well for one, If we had a sustainable colony on Mars humanity's cance of extinction decreases exponentially.  It can be a rally point for future colonization, as well as a blueprint to the process. We could mine, we could harvest energy, we could terraform (eventually, an would actually probably help with research.) Not to mention that we would be one step closer to moving out of this solar system and if you cant see the purpose in that, I am a little sad and a little mad. 
Billions is something of an exaggeration isn't it?

Anyways nothing is more valuable than knowledge and "does life exist outside earth?" is a very important question.

Either answer will be shockingly paradigm shifting.

Now me personally I find sports a waste of time and always resent being forced to pay for stadiums
As has been noted, a backup for humanity is always a good idea (That's why you carry a spare around with you in most cars, backup your drives, etc.) Additionally, research usually pays dividends over the long term. Electronics, as an industry, came about as a result of 19th century electromagnetic research. Similarly, we might find some ingenious way of making something in orbit that is substantially cheaper than on the ground (hyperfilament from [The Fountains of Paradise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountains_of_Paradise) comes to mind). Alternatively, many minor bodies (asteroids, comets, etc.) are rich in metals, which, once industry is established, could turn quite the profit.
To be human is to be curious, to explore, to want to know. I am also 70 and do not want to live in a cave. 
You have probably never heard of this but tell your uncle that if life from Earth is found on Mars as the EPZ theory predicts (https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPlanetZero/),the implications for humanity will be staggering. That will mean that there have been 3.5 billion plus years for life from Earth to travel to other planets in the Solar System and our galaxy. What this might mean for humanity is yet to be understood.
Well, if we exactly knew *what* we would invent it wouldn*t be *research*. Things like TV and GPS are only possible because we have spent much money on figuring out how rockets and space works.

The CANADARM installed on the ISS has lead to surgical robots that assist in complex surgical procedures.

Wikipedia has a list of technologies that were spun-off from NASA alone, and it is not exhaustive:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_spin-off_technologies

> NASA claims that there are nearly 1,800 other spin-offs in the fields of computer technology, environment and agriculture, health and medicine, public safety, transportation, recreation, and industrial productivity.

But the direct spin-offs are only *one small* contribution. Advancing our knowledge leads to new discoveries - and thus new technologies. If humans would not do research, we would still be in the middle ages (or even less advanced). Curiosity and the ability to deduct things is what seperates us from animals and what made us, as a species, grow.

Space exploration is the most difficult, most demaning and most punishing endeavour you can undertake. Things invented for space are usually well tasted, safe and sound. If you can do something in space, it sure as hell works easier on Earth. So every challenge we master in space exploration is again some small piece of knowledge we can apply on Earth. But we often can't say beforehand what we might find.
It's really not that much, we spend trillions each year on social security and medicare/medicaid which people like your uncle (let's just say he's an old uncle) likely use. We can afford a few billion here and there and if he doesn't understand that it's not a lot in a relative way then who cares? We still spending it anyway it's not like your uncle is making policy decisions..
In the early 1800s all the fundamental research in electricity and electronics had no immediate practical application whatsoever. Scientists studied it because it was interesting to find out how the universe works. Now the whole world runs on electricity. 
Cant. We need to refocus that spending on fixing our atmosphere and pollution problems. What is the point of exploring the universe only to repeat earth's destruction on another planet?
The problem is not with spending billions of dollars. The problem is with spending taxpayer funds.

I don't know what the hell you're saying, but that's a good moon pic.

Edit;  Thank you for the gold!
amazing shot.  It looks like there is a pool of water on the left in that dark spot.  
I don't think I've seen many photos of the moon this detailed. Nice work!
What kind of lens and camra did you use? To you have a picture of your set up
Absolutely amazing, wonderful job and thanks for sharing. I spent so long zoomed in just admiring the landscape in such detail I'm still blown away that you're able to get such an amazing picture from the confines of our atmosphere. Galileo was excommunicated for drawing the same moon and now it's my phone background. 

Your other pictures are equally awe inspiring. I will admit I was dumbstruck at your gif of Jupiter, I was wondering how many years it took to get it to fucking move, like you could see its orbit almost. I couldn't believe it, went to look at the comments to see how you did it and I was floored it only had like forty up votes. Then I saw it was kerbal lol. Once again, thanks. I hope you keep up the hobby so we can continue to reap the benefits xD
what are the lines, or paths or whatever those are that come from the craters?
That's amazing... Can you explain your process? How are you determining the soil differences?
The other day I was looking at the gibbous moon through a telescope, and I think I've decided that's the best time to look at it. 

You get to see Tycho, Plato, and Copernicus craters all right along the terminator so they have nice long shadows. They are easy to locate and easy to enjoy. 
I'd like to thank you for the new wallpaper on my phone. I hope that's ok. ;)
Cool! Here's mine:
 http://i.imgur.com/8XGwn48

I have the ZWOASI120MM. I think I've seen you on r/astrophotography. We have a similar set up.

As you can see, I missed a spot :(
How does one take a picture like this? Whats the equipment and how much would it cost approx?

this could just be me being uneducated about this, but what are the brighter crater looking spots? any significance? 
Hell of a lot better than what I [did](http://i.imgur.com/KdeegY9.jpg) but mine was just with my cellphone through my telescope. Still need to figure out how to effectively use my dslr but there's so much to learn. 
That one crater at the bottom is so big. I would have loved to see that one hit.
Wow. You really did a great job of bringing out all the colors in perfect clarity. 
That is pretty fucking awesome (and I had fun saying your last name like a bad Sopranos extra)
When you look at pictures like that and see all the craters and stuff, you realize that our little buddy up in the sky has certainly protected us from a lot of things...
Stunning picture! Thank you for sharing, I don't think I've ever seen the Moon like this before. Have you posted a higher res version anywhere? I'd love to have it as background on my 4k screen. It's simply amazing. 
That's so crazy you can see the moon cities. Imagine all the moon people down there just living their lives, oblivious to the fact that we are watching them. 
look how transparent the moon is... the dark parts and during the day it's light blue.
Are there any satellites measuring mineral content on the moon/mars. Mostly mars.
Makes it look alive. Like there are a bunch of cities there waiting to be discovered. 
I am always fascinated by that crater at the bottom when I see this or similar pictures, if the moon is tidally locked and we only see the same face, then how did whatever hit the moon (it looks more recent) not come careening into the Earth?

I know the distance is great and all but still, you'd think the trajectory would have been seriously altered. That's gotta at least be a skimjob no?
98% minerals, nice. Who'd you take it from? The Eee consortium maybe?
Best moon shot I've ever seen. Well done, this is genuinely beautiful. 
I zoomed into that bright blue dot on the upper left side.......is that a picture of Adolf Hitler?
First time seeing moon like this and its totally different than i saw it in the night!!
Thanks
I love it! I also added some relief and stylized it a little, for funsies 

http://iob.imgur.com/uYGg/xrSA2WUiqy
Very beautiful. 

I was always fascinated by astronauts coming back and saying the dirt was a brown color when they landed. It's just strange since you can't really capture the same aesthetic from Earth unless you make a mineral composition photo like this. 
One of the best Moon Shots I have ever come across, thanks for sharing this!
You TOOK the MOON?! First Carmen Sandiego now you?! Will somebody stop the madness?!!
I hope you don't mind me sharing, I added a starfield and resized it for my desktop background.

exurb1a is great, check out his other videos on the youtube channel.
We could also be statistically an early civilization (first 5-10%) based off the expected lifespan of the universe (100trillion years). The universe hasn't had time to spawn many more habitable worlds and the Milky Ways planet forming days are numbered. 
The problem with the moon. Is it's the same.  Always the same. And not particularly beautiful.  Grey and blotchy. 
You know what's even more expensive than a weather satellite?  Not having a robust weather reporting infrastructure.  :)
Forbes blocks this site if you're using Adblock, therefore, by definition, the site is not worth visiting.
Hold on... isn't temperature measured by the speed of molecules moving in an area? So if it were completely empty space, there should not be any temperature, yeah?
You can really get a sense of the amazing Gimbal range of the SSMEs in this photo as they center the thrust of the STS.

I didn't realize the shuttle's rockets also fired on liftoff. Thought those were only used in space. 
The best part about these things is that the rocket engines are fed fuel by basically a really big electric turbocharger that rams fuel into the chamber and maintains back pressure to keep the rocket from exploding, because it's literally just a bomb that blows up slowly and in only one direction.

There will be no servicing. It's one go, monolithic mission.  

I am sure future, space tourists and souvenir collectors would be delighted with this satellite..
That's the problem. Currently we do not have any spacecraft capable of servicing the JWST. So if something goes wrong, there's no getting to it until we can make a new manned vehicle that can survive for a couple months on its own.
They did add a docking port to JWST, on the off chance we develop the technologies to go out that far, but until that happens, we won't be able to service it
Orbital ATK is launching a Space Repair/Tug in late 2018 on a Proton rocket. It will mate up with an Intelsat satellite for checkout, then proceed to another satellite that needs refueling and possibly course correction. There is a big addition to the commercialization of space and that is being able to repair and return large satellites, from low orbit now, GEO in a couple more years. There are other repair/refueling/tug robot spacecraft being developed. The hope is JWST doesn't have any immediate catastrophic failures and the possibility for either being towed back to a repair orbit or repaired/refueled/course correction  systems will be in place by the time it is needed. Also, SLS Block II and Orion will have the capability. A million miles is only 4 times the distance to the Moon and SLS is being designed to take very large payloads into very high orbits, possible L1 assembly of the MTV.  
  
http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/17/orbital-atk-starts-up-a-space-tow-truck-service.aspx
If there is any entity in the world that can pull this off, its NASA. They are far and away the most successful program on these big, tentpole missions though. 
Prospects for a repair aren't hopeless. *Eventually* we'll be able to reach L2 and might be able to fix whatever is wrong - the telescope won't be going anywhere.

But yeah, if it fails, then future prospects or not it will be labelled a multi-billion dollar waste of taxpayer money. NASA remembers the Hubble fiasco and is doing everything within their power to make sure it is fully functional before launch.

Why do you assume it will be serviced? Hubble is pretty unique in that way. Satellites rarely are designed for being serviced, and JWSt is no exception. If it fails, it fails. Thats why so much money is spent on building it properly and making sure it actually works without hiccups.
Oh, snap!

So, here's one idea: a lot of money is spent as overheads, having SLS around in the first place.

So launch more of them to spread out the costs!
Thanks to Utah we can expect them to explode like the Challenger.  Segmented death sticks.
Cancel it and focus on something worthwhile. Their plans seem less ambitious than the private companies. NASA should do stuff that otherwise would not get done. Everything else should go to the private sector... Especially ferrying stuff to LEO.

This is the expedition 50 launch which took place on Thursday (November 17th). 
That's crazy. I've never seen a successful long exposure of a launch with a remote camera. Cool. 
FIIIIIIIINAAAAAAAAL FLAAAAAAAAAAASH! But seriously, that looks AMAZING
Beautiful photo, but how is the whole image not overexposed?  I have to imagine that scene would be incredibly bright. 
I have a question, wouldn't the smoke from the launch make the image much more hazy and blurred than it appears to be? 
Someone call the Avengers. There must be a some shit going down because skybeam is never a good sign. 
This reminds the Ion Cannon from C&C series.

I don't completely understand long exposures sometimes. Forgive me for being stupid. Lol. But if the shudder is left open,  then why don't we see like all the smoke and that? Some long exposure photos,  like this one,  make me wonder things like this and I always wanted to know.
We need to upvote all the reposts of this to the top so the front page of reddit looks like one giant churro.

Acquisition details? Did you have a solar filter on or something to darken the photo by so much
Looks like something villains would target to destroy/corrupt the region it's in. Like a world crystal or a power core.
Incredible! I wonder how dark the ND filter had to be... The most extreme ND filters available can turn a seconds worth of light into months!
Reminds me of the Launch Base Zone from Sonic the Hedgehog 3.

Go! Go! Gogogo! Go! Go! Go!

Made me think of [this](https://gyazo.com/19bac319dfbd59b8f742785762681b6c)
So, little bit of an eng. question. Looking at this shape, (horizontal exit from nozzle), can we say it is in optimum exit pressure aka p2=p3 ?
i always struggle with how fast a rocket takes off. shooting fireworks, they shoot to the sky super fast, but i feel like a rocket has to start off slow like it just hover-takeoffs. i need to see one in person to fathom it.
I'm hearing the Inception noise while looking at this. Or the Reaper noise from Mass Effect.

Is there any advantage to the way the Russians hold rockets in place with those like 5 holders that flop away at launch vs what we use with the large towers?
I wonder if the photographer needed to stabilize the camera because of the ground vibrations created by the rocket launch.
I wonder what the atmosphere would look like if we could see a long exposure of every rocket launch's trail.
It looks like kids toy trucks and whatnot scattered in front of a curtained window, with just a sliver of light coming through where the panels meet. 

I need to get out of the house more. 
I've been one of the lucky ones that was able to witness one of these launches IRL . The thing that jumps into my mind every time I think back is the awesome overwhelming sound of those engines. 
"Oh now, I have to stop vegeta or the earth will be destroyed!"
"KAMEHAMEHA!!!!" 
"Not enough, KAIOKEN TIMES 4!!!!!!!!!" 
An interesting fact that some people might not know. The "smoke" you're accustomed to seeing on launches is actually water vapour. At launch hundreds of tonnes of water flood the launch pad to dampen the noise and shockwave from the engines. Both for our (anyone watching) safety and the structural integrity of surrounding buildings and the rocket itself. Explanations can be found through this thread explaining why it doesn't show up on these types of exposures.
Fuck the ISS. Stop terrorizing America. We didn't do anything, leave the middle east alone.
They're okay to hang out with, but I wouldn't invite them home for dinner.
I think this universe is expanding and is finite. I'm interested in time over distance and what time actually is. What would be the effect on energy if time had magnitude and if time was not uniform through out the universe. What if the effects of time were different from the quantum level to the universal level. I'm a professional coffee taster so I have absolutely no clue what I'm talking about but I've wondered about that for years.
So I was just reading about black holes, and they said there have been no white holes discovered ever, but that one may have started the Big Bang and created the universe.

So if a white hole is the other side of a black hole, we are living inside a black hole, and our universe was spawned from a black hole in another universe, and black holes spawn more universes inside our black hole, and inside all of those black holes.. you get the idea. 

The universe is ever expanding because the black hole we live in continues to consume...space. Would it be possible to travel to the point? Would space act differently as you travel towards the other universes black hole event horizon, if that point isn't already so infinitely small to you and completely lost in the abyss that is a black hole which is our endless space..?

This is of course a theory and very interesting to think about.
Yes but only a stone from an asteroid. 3-5 meters big. 

+ there is already an asteroid between the earth and the moon. The asteroid is called HO3. He came into this orbit 100 years ago
I think this mission gets cancelled under the new administration. 
Ok so this duplicated a few times, so here it is.

This was my first attempt at the Horsehead Nebula and my first shot with my new modded DSLR.

Don't get opinions. Get facts.


The [NASA](https://twitter.com/NASA), [astronaut](https://twitter.com/NASA_Astronauts), and [ISS](https://twitter.com/Space_Station) twitter feeds are a good place to start.

You can also look on the [NASA site itself](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/releases/the-bare-necessities-surviving-the-rigors-of-space-travel.html).

Good luck!
This is so inspirational.
She was also the first woman (and I think the first non-pilot) to be chief of the Astronaut Office.
Na the spacecraft is going to be in a very high orbit; and currently the second stage is still in flight with the spacecraft. The upper stage hasn't made a single revolution around the earth yet (currently climbing to apogee) and the booster splashed down in the Atlantic. 
May have been a satellite or the ISS. When they pass into Earth's shadow, they vanish.

There was a mag 2.2 pass of [ERBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Radiation_Budget_Satellite) in that timeframe after the launch that passed into shadow.

http://heavens-above.com/passdetails.aspx?lat=28.219&lng=-82.458&loc=Land+O%27+Lakes&alt=22&tz=EST&satid=15354&mjd=57711.9999089151
Planets around other stars used to be fantasy. We've found thousands through deduction and even visibly observed a few more. We've got a new satellite (James Webb Space Telescope) that'll make Hubble look like a toy. 

We've basically confirmed the universe is expanding and has been since the big bang, thanks to the WMAP research.

We've determined that organic molecules like amino acids can travel on comets, giving credence to the once scoffed at idea of panspermia. We've also determined mars likely had constant liquid water at some point, which is another great indicator of life out there. 

We've mapped countless stars and galaxies, and basically the idea that life is out there is all but a given - the only question we have is "okay, what about complex life, and beyond?". 

SETI still isn't taken all that seriously though (though more so than they were back when coffee cans and satellite dishes were their bread and butter), and bad news: Pluto isn't a planet anymore either. The galactic council voted against it, or something.
In 1996 I was taught that Pluto was the furthest planet from the sun when in fact in was Neptune at that time. 

http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question5.html

However, since 1999 Neptune crossed Pluto's orbit is once again closer to the Sun and well, you all know about Pluto's demotion.
My grandma has a school book, it talks about vegetation and life on Mars.  It's funny reading it today. 
Very sadly, what you learn in middle school today is also wrong and if you don't go to college, you will never know (special relativity, quantum mechanics...)
The 'Rare Earth' hypothesis:

The idea that Earth is somehow special and that the conditions for forming life require a long set of coincidences that mean life in the universe could be extremely rare. 

***Yeah, right***

Even if Earth-twins turn out to be rare, it wont matter. Because in our solar system alone we now know of 5 worlds we're sure have underground subsurface oceans, and another 7 we suspect to but have yet to be confirmed. Every year another candidate is added to that list. Subsurface oceans are *clearly* the most common habitat for life in the universe, alien life under the icy moons of gas giants probably outnumber 'normal', terrestrial-based life 10 to 1

Planets are around other stars, the universe is expanding, amino acids exist on comets, Pluto isn't a planet, Mars has liquid water.

Bigelow himself has a direct interest in ramping up NASA funding. His company, [Bigelow Aerospace is in the running for the deep space habitat contract in the Orion Program and the technology for Bigelow's proposed deep space habitat is already being tested at the ISS in the BEAM module.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uE0ISlYhHQ) The deep space habitat would be used to house astronauts during missions beyond the moon, to Mars and the Asteroids. 
I don't want to see more money mindlessly shoveled into NASA without a specific purpose.  I'd rather see it starved of all funds than have funding misdirected to failing/purposeless programs like the SLS and Orion capsule.  

If the funding was to support more exploration of the Lunar or Martian surfaces, more probes to go in-system and look at the moons of Jupiter, or even longer-term R&D for a permanent space station at one of the Lagrangian points or in orbit around the Moon, I'm ok with it.  If not...

NASA lost its way a long time ago.  Throwing more money at it won't fix the underlying problems.  
Can we see the business case for this though?  

not like the govt is flush with cash, and at this point, private industry is handling commercial needs with far lower costs.  I see no reason to fight this trend.
Can't see it happening. The Repubs cut things back a lot under W, including the shuttle and any potential successor. They made it clear they want private enterprise to take over. If Trump delivers on his pledge to cut personal and business taxes there will be even less money available. 
It's made out of glass. You can look through to the molten core. Every 11.7 years the glass planet happens to focus the light on it's moon, melting a hole into it.
Earth. We can create the lowest temperature in the universe. We are the "coolest" planet
Budget? There is nothing good under $200.

The Orion XT6 is currently at $270 compared to the normal $300, I would consider that the minimum.
Hello :-) What is your budget?

Don't rely on super discounts, most stores have just the typical bad entry level telescopes (despite some good reviews on their sites). So no "best sellers" and five-star rated telescopes, and 500x magnification super beginner telescopes.


Check telescope.com, telescopesplus.com, optcorp.com... And even there, don't buy just any telescope.

&nbsp;

What is your budget?

~$400

 - Zhumell z8 - Best accessories, large aperture; **[What to expect in different telescope aperture sizes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/3j2wjo/what_is_a_good_telescope_in_this_budget/cum0622)**

 - Skywatcher 8" is the cheapest and has a better finder than the xt8. Check for used ones around/under $300.

 - There's also the Celestron Nexstar 127 SLT, but GoTo does *not* make everything easier, and most money goes towards a cheap computerized mount. A 5" will not show nearly as much as a 8". A good guide such as "Turn left at Orion" is an easier read than the SLT's manual, and you will need to know a few basics anyway - even with GoTo ;-) And with a good guide finding things isn't really all that difficult (plus there are free apps that will utilize your phone's motion sensors to literally point you in the right direction).

&nbsp;

$300

 - 6" dobsonian (Skywatcher has a better focuser and finder than the Orion xt6) - Also check for used ones (see below)


&nbsp;

$200 

 - used/refurbished *[xt6](http://www.telescope.com/2nd-Orion-SkyQuest-XT6-Classic-Dobsonian-Telescope/p/102341.uts)*

 - AWB Onesky (or Zhumell z130, Meade Lightbridge Mini 130); 

 - For it's used/refurbished price, the [xt4.5](http://www.telescope.com/Sale/Clearance-Center/Clearance-Telescopes/2nd-Orion-SkyQuest-XT45-Classic-Dobsonian-Telescope/pc/6/c/777/sc/81/p/102297.uts?refineByCategoryId=81); Despite a bit less aperture, the long focal length has contrast benefits.


&nbsp;

$100 - Not a whole lot. Skyscanner 100, but telescopes in this price range have multiple flaws

Avoid the 127eq, 114/1000 and other reflectors with a much shorter tube than their focal length (exception: Maksutovs, Schmidt-Cassegrains).


&nbsp;

Under $100 - most likely binoculars or a used one.


&nbsp;

Clear skies!
This is the same rocket that will be taking up the James Webb Space Telescope in October of 2018.

Anyone who can link to some stats or details about the thrust of the boosters in the side vs the center one. And is it solid rockets or liquid engines like the center one?

Either you guys are stupid or its me; because that looks an awful lot like the sun, and I know how to use a semicolon and recognize an on running sentence.
If they think that's the moon they should go over their calculations again.
sun or moon its terrible quality. especially after just seeing that shuttle photo taken by six cameras which was whoaaaa eye popping. this one is nice in theory, but fail in actual photo.

Taken early October. Focal length 85 mm, f/2, ISO 400. Two 2-minute exposures, one for the sky and one for the foreground, combined in Photoshop. [Here's how it's done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccp8_8P66Vw).
If you haven't already, open this photo at full resolution. The small preview doesn't do it justice. 
This makes me want to get a good camera and learn about photography. Inspiring work OP!
Awesome photo, what time did you shoot this? Sirius gets high enough only near 1 am here in italy
Thanks for the new phone wallpaper. http://imgur.com/HF9phvG 
  
  
It does look gorgeous. 
These ideas make a lot of sense, but there's so much  potential evidence for alien visitation here on earth that I really can't believe they're not watching us. 
Seems to be aimed mainly at reducing costs for these systems, though with the possibility of replacement/augmentation. I doubt that'll work out though, theres not really a whole lot to make cheaper on SLS or Orion, the basic architecture is inherently going to result in a crazy expensive design.
The article is pretty terrible, but Newt is really a big NASA supporter. I'd rather have Trump appoint him than someone that doesn't believe in NASA. 

HAHAHAHAHA!

OMG, can't breathe...

Thanks for sharing! It's a great photo.
Regardless of what I'm learning about, I *always* learn faster by doing. I hate school because I never get to experience the subject matter in the real world so I'm essentially taking the book's word for everything, which is pretty dangerous IMO. I wish learning was more like the chemistry labs I used to take.
Depends on the activity, you're certainly better off not attempting skydiving, than failing at it.
Gozer the Gozarian? Someone in NASA is a classic Ghostbusters fan then?
I'm leaving Orlando today and was really hoping that I would be able to see this launch. Unfortunately the launch date was moved from the 16th to today. Maybe I will be able to see it from the airport though.

Bonus photo: [Closeup of the GOES-R payload fairing](http://i.imgur.com/HVWUYK4.jpg).
My pre-calc teacher went to the cape to see this launch. Very jealous, but its no SpaceX.
Even if you've seen the movie, *The Martian* is definitely worth a read.
The Foundation trilogy by Isaac Asimov is fantastic. The Warhammer 40k series is utterly ridiculous both in it's writing and in the fact that there are like 40 or so books in the series but it is a fun read. I've heard great things about Carl Sagan's work but haven't quite gotten around to those yet.
Space book, or science fiction book?

Dragonfly, This New Ocean, Flight, Failure Is Not An Option

All are historical documents of space flight and ground ops

Also, seconding the Martian, and adding Seveneves.  The ISS research that went into Seveneves is obvious for those familiar with it.
Larklight/Starcross/Mothstorm by Philip Reeve, because who doesn't love a spacefaring British Empire? 
I haven't actually gone through that many *full books*. Among the ones I did I'd count Freitas's *Xenology* and Clarke's *Ignition!*. Freitas gives a very accessible overview of cosmology and its implications for evolution of life here and elsewhere. Clarke gives the stories of completely insane people trying to make use of hideously dangerous chemicals to make the rockets go "FWOOSH!"
Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku is really great, it's all about quantum physics, higher dimensions, and the Big Bang theory
"Packing for Mars" by Mary Roach is enjoyable if you're looking for nonfiction
Obviously The Martian, Enders game is a very easy read but a good one
[Red Dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dwarf) series of books are hilarious to read, and way better than the show cos they can do more without needing CGI and stuff.

I'm a bit confused by the question.  Heat is the presence of thermal energy, and "cold" is comparative meaning something has less thermal energy than whatever you're comparing it to.  If a material conducts heat well, it allows thermal energy to transfer through it efficiently (like copper).  If something "holds" thermal energy, it inefficiently transfers thermal energy to its surroundings (aerogel perhaps?).  I'm trying to refer to solid materials (presumably at around room temperature) as requested, but materials can melt or boil, so it depends on your temperature range too.

On the molecular level, thermal energy is the vibration or motion of particles.  That means things that are more dense (more particles together in a smaller volume) tend to more efficiently pass that energy on to neighbouring particles by the way of conduction.  Other factors enter into the equation, but i'm trying to keep it simple.

If you're asking for something that does both at the same time, I'm not an expert in the field but I think that might be a bit like asking to meet a person that is simultaneously both very tall and very short.  There is a spectrum between "good conductor" and "bad conductor" where something that "does both" is about in the middle and does neither particularly well.

Thermal conductivity is a measure of how a material conducts heat though, if that helps.  Aerogel would have a relatively low thermal conductivity, copper would have a relatively high thermal conductivity.

Hopefully that helps.  It's not the best scientific answer I've ever given, but the question makes it a tricky one to helpfully answer.
You're looking for something that is both a decent heat conductor and has a high specific heat. There aren't many solid materials that are good at both. Water is one of the best.
I mean, it's the twenty-first century already.  
We need a moonbase. Just sayin'..
This is the one thing I like about Trump so far (and who knows if he will actually do it) but the fact that he Is pushing for space, as a 13 year old who will grow up as we go to mars and other places (I want to go to mars) I really hope he follows through with the things he saws about space but we never know
"As a political candidate, I'll go with how people feel and I'll let you go with the theoriticians." -newt Gingrich 

You think this man is interested at all in science? This mindset is representative of their party
Trump who's a business man and does anything to lower the bottom line, and the GOP the people who haven't done anything in 8 years?

Keep dreaming
we've already been there! Quit trying to make the 1950/60's happen again and get to Mars!
Why is this being down voted? This is an honest question and not someone being a dick at all. 
Yes, but not perceptibly different. The ISS has maybe a few extra nanoseconds per Earth year because of the *slightly* lower gravity.

You've watched *Interstellar*, have you not?
Yes and no.  Yes in that there would be a difference, but unless a planet is really close to a supermassive black hole the differences would be measured in micro or nanoseconds per year.
Layperson here. Does this paper support the notion that the EM drive does indeed produce thrust?  1.2±0.1mN/kW seems a very little thrust for quit a bit of energy. .
Why don't we just take the planet and [move](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/356/test.gif) it into the habitable zone.  
Then it can become [Earth II](http://i2.wp.com/thelowdownunder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Planet-Earth-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C576) and we can move there when this planet is no longer inhabitable in a few thousand years.  
Although it'll probably take a few thousand years for planet moving technology to catch up.  
Hmm, paradoxical.
Why do science reporters use the phrase "the planet is just ____ light years away"?

Even one light year is not a small distance.

So you're telling me that if I'm an astronaut, I can't bring my baby goats to work?  That's appalling.
If he's got a PC have a look at Kerbal Space Program. Otherwise there's loads of mission patches on eBay you could put on a Nasa polo shirt, Apollo ones if he's into the old days or space shuttle for the thirtysomethings. If he's a big kid or you've got kids there's a cardboard kit 6ft rocket you can get at various retailers. Hope that helps! 

Edit to add: a canvas print of "Earth Rise" looks brilliant hung on a wall. 
Does he have any favourite astronauts?  
I was given a book autographed by Chris Hadfield, and I swear I stare at that thing lovingly almost ever night...
If this is his favourite sub isn't there a chance he's gonna find out what you're getting him? Everyone with a wife check their reddit accounts!

Edit: actually now that I think about it if you don't respond to any of the comments it'll only narrow it down
The  "mini museum" is pretty awesome. They are a little pricy and I'm not a hundred percent sure that's the name but they are limited numbers the last run they did had a bunch of stuff like a small piece of a moon rock and meteorite.
I'd recommend binoculars. You can get [these](https://www.amazon.com/Celestron-71198-Cometron-Binoculars-Black/dp/B00DV6SI3Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1479525783&sr=1-1&keywords=7x50). I have these and even though I live in the middle of a city with 7 million people in it I enjoy looking at the night sky.
Get one of those porthole shaped frames and a sick space print and throw it on the wall.
A few off the top of my head. 

There's a good movie/documentary called "In the shadow of the moon" 

NASA has some posters of the planets and missions that could be framed (they're very artistic looking) 

A NASA shirt, maybe one of the commemorative coins from the Atlantis rollover when they moved it to the display at KSC. 

Edit: formatted 
Apart from other physical gifts, Tickets to the planetarium for the family? Idk if you have kids. If yes, and depending on their age, it could be fun. If its just the two of you, it should be a nice gesture he may like. 
[This site](http://2046printshop.com/printshop/) was posted recently, with some great science-themed prints and t-shirts, including some spiffy space-oriented ones.  I'm thinking about a few of them myself
I'd get a telescope. Just a 2 min Amazon search shows that you can get decent stuff in that price range, for example: https://www.amazon.com/Celestron-21035-70mm-Travel-Scope/dp/B001TI9Y2M 

Note that this is just the first shopping result I have found, I am sure that on reddit (e.g. /r/telescopes/ )  will be people who can recommend you the best one.


Take him to watch a launch in person, either at Cape Canaveral or another launch facility. Get a hotel for the night and make a mini vacation out of it! (Im hoping *my* wife sees this...)

Explanation: A supermoon sets over the metropolis of Philadelphia in this twilight snapshot captured on November 14 at 6:21am Eastern Standard Time. Within hours of the Moon's exact full phase, that time does correspond to a lunar perigee or the closest point in the Moon's elliptical orbit around our fair planet. Slightly bigger and brighter at perigee, this Full Moon is still flattened and distorted in appearance by refraction in atmospheric layers along the sight-line near the horizon. Also like more ordinary Full Moons, it shines with the warm color of sunlight. Joined by buildings along the Philadelphia skyline, the perigee full moonlight is reflected in the waters of the mighty Schuylkill River.
What you have circled *is* the Sun. The only thing in front of it are clouds. Perhaps you were confused because the Sun wasn't at the brightest spot in the sky? That can happen if the cloud cover is very uneven, as is the case in your pictures: while the Sun is nearly obscured, sunlight can stream through thinner clouds nearby and give the impression that's the Sun is elsewhere in the sky.
If something is between you and the Sun then you would be looking at the back unlit side of it, so it would basically be invisible especially during the day. When there is a new moon (AKA no moon) that is when the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun. 

That is most likely dirt or something on the lens causing some optical artifact.
Those are...clouds.

Clouds are not uniform thickness. When they pass in front of the sun, it does not dim uniformly.
Just saw this article. Take it with a grain of salt given the source

My 6 year old is really into space and space exploration right now.  We just started watching "When we left Earth", which is the history of the NASA manned program. 

It's available on Discovery right now and seems very well done,  with a lot of old video, including a lot from the Mercury program in episode 1.
I really need to stop taking for granted the fact that rocket launches happen on a regular basis only 2.5 hours away.

On another note, how are all those cars not stuck in the sand?
Old guy here. When the first astronauts flew into space, all of us were glued in front our TV sets and stayed there through the duration of the mission. I think interest faded by the Gemini program, but spiked again in 1969 for the Apollo 11 flight. It was an amazing time.
So did people back then watching this think that "Wow, we're in the future"?
I've been reading "the right stuff" and thought I recognized that name. Great read on the test pilots who eventually went on to become the first astronauts. 
Um, isn't Cocoa Beach on the same island / land mass as Cape Canaveral?
What an awesome pic. Is that the full size image? Want it as my desktop background haha.
Alan Shephard went to myou high-school in Derry NH, Pinkerton Academy. The cafeteria is called the Shephard building. He also grew up here.
Amazing shot! You should consider crossposting this to /r/spaceflightporn
It's weird growing up In Houston. I grew up with Scott Parazynski's son, went to the same school and church. Like most people here would over look it. 
I may be the only one with the balls to ask this, but who the hell is this guy?

(I just want to pay the respect I evidently owe him)
It's super weird I had dehydrated ice cream that astronauts eat. Sorry guys that's all Ive got!  Great pic! This guy is the real deal!  kids should look up to and be a fan of people like this. Not pro sports players and movie stars. This man has made a real contribution to the world!
I used to work at JSC in Houston and I shared an elevator with Russell Yates during all "the news"
>Now, what would you use to show Elon Musk who's the real supervillain on the block?

FOOF and Dimethylmercury


http://www.tor.com/2012/07/20/a-tall-tail/
In plasma propulsion we have had some pretty fun one too :

- Mercury : Very dense and easy to handle and store with good performances. It was used a lot in the 60's. Elemental mercury isn't that toxic in itself if you don't breath its vapor all day long. However it will amalgam with aluminium and turn your spacecraft into wet paste.

- Lithium : used in some MPD. Not very fun when it's pulverized all over your test chamber. (edit: for those wondering it's exothermic on contact with water and dust does very nasty things to you lungs and even skin).

- Radon : in theory it would be better for ion thrusters than Xenon. It's heavier and easier to turn into plasma. The only slight issue is that it is radioactive with a half life of 4 days for its most stable isotope. It's really easy to inhale and produce ionizing radiation. It's also about $400,000 per micro-gram.

- Iodine : this one is fairly tame. It tends to corrode metals and isn't particularly healthy to breath or touch. The fact that you store it as an unpressurized solid is very attractive. People are experimenting with it.
I don't know how well any of these would compete against Elon Musk. Even if you could disregard all environmental concerns, storage and handling of such toxic substances would drive your costs way above RP-1 and LOX. 

Not very useful if you want to compete....

That being said, NSWR all the way. High thrust and high ISP are the best.
Even if we ignore environmental concerns (which has been driving out use of highly toxic propellants over the last couple of decades worldwide), the use of these highly toxic propellants has a huge cost associated with them (e.g. manufacturing, shipment, handling, etc.) which may largely negate the improvement in performance in a competitive launch market.
https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19860018652.pdf has some fun triple propellant ones, beryllium/hydrogen/oxygen, beryllium/hydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide, lithium/hydrogen/florine.

in the 50's and 60's there was the idea of using beryllium as an additive in solid rocket fuel

project pluto was a nuclear ramjet which had direct contact between the core and exhaust.

My favorite ones are the solid, liquid and gaseous core nuclear thermal rockets.

"Water suspension of uranium or plutonium salt, 20% enriched - atomic monopropellant for Nuclear Salt Water Rockets. Flow enough of it into the engine chamber to achieve a nuclear explosion, keep flowing enough of it in to keep the nuclear explosion continuous, ???, PROFIT. To quote the title of Zubrin's report, "high thrust at 10,000 sec Isp", which is ion engine level of efficiency."

I think I got a semi reading that.

There is also theoretical stuff like metastable metallic hydrogen, which one day might enter the list.
The correct answer isn't even listed here:

[Project Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_\(nuclear_propulsion\))

To be clear, this isn't the anemic 'Orion' that doesn't even have heat shields strong enough to withstand a return from Mars, this is the original nuclear-bomb propelled concept from the 50s.  Using a giant shock-absorber, the welded steel construction (it could be built in conventional shipyards) miniature city would ride a series of shaped nuclear explosions to orbit and beyond.  The more mass, the more efficient the transfer of energy too so the optimal size would tend towards the gigantic.  

Many scientists believe that had this been vigorously pursued, humanity could have been visiting Saturn by the 1980s.

You want a nasty and effective method for getting a LOT of stuff off the ground?  Don't think little teeny rockets, think PUTT PUTT.
These are... unpleasant. I doubt the extra costs involved would allow them to be practical even with no environmental regulations (Syntin in probably the cheapest of these, and the Soviets already found that to be too expensive and ended use of it not long after).

I doubt theres much of anything better than methalox thats viable outside a lab. Theres others that have better ISP and density, but most are hideously toxic (as above), require heavy and complex tankage to support multiple propellants (some of them extremely hot, cold, or solid), are way too expensive, eat away the engine rendering reuse impossible, or all 4.
The problem is that these are all worse and more expensive than hydrolox. You haven't solved any problems, and you've created a lot more. "Better" and "nastier" are not synonyms.
Everybody is going to LOX+CH4 for the main launch section, for many, many, many reasons. Anybody that pays attention is going to see the comparisons of the new engines for SpaceX, Blue Origin, ULA, the others, they are much smaller with much more thrust, variable throttling, fewer components, more modular design, and most of all , large decrease in extremely high speed turbines, prone to random failure.  
  
Along with "nasty" fuel comes nasty handling plus increased handling complexity.  All that is needed is safe, reliable, quick orbital insertion of large payloads. The payloads are what become space craft themselves with various exotic propulsion systems.
Changing the chemistry of rocket fuels only gives you a marginal increase in performance.  The right answer is to stop using chemical rockets as much as possible.  For example, [air-breathing engines](http://arc.uta.edu/research/pde_files/IspvsM.jpg) have many times the performance, although it varies by Mach number.  Ground accelerators like [hypersonic gas guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEDC_Range_G#/media/File:AEDC_Range-G_Launcher_facility.jpg) avoid using any propellant until you leave the barrel.  Various kinds of [space elevators](http://alnaspaceprogram.org/studies/tether_release/HTMLFiles/rotovator_release_orbits_1.gif) can replace part of the rocket job with electric propulsion that is ten times as efficient.
It was my first trip to KSC and I was blown away everything I saw there. The Heroes and Legends exhibit is really well done with a lot of neat displays inside. I definitely recommend checking it out.
It took me a while to work out what KSC actually was after playing ksp
Had this been America instead of China, then this thread would've been full of activity. 

We should rename this sub to NASA instead, seeing as most of the subscribers actively despise other space programs.
This means Ceres has a subsurface ocean which could potentially harbor life. 
Maybe this is why city dwellers are often perceived as elitist or arrogant. Too much light pollution, no stars to observe, no inner monologue to question their significance thus no humbling factor to treat everyone the same. 

Eh what do i know i just woke up. Good morning everyone
how about that there is no 'up' - you could just as easily imagine yourself dangling on Earth's gravity, like a paperclip hanging on a magnet, over an infinite void...
This single [image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/NASA-HS201427a-HubbleUltraDeepField2014-20140603.jpg) does it for me. Explanation of the image can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field).
I am always mind boggled when I look up at the Milky Way and realize that I am overlooking the entire plane of the galaxy. There it is. That is the galaxy. Right there.
Thats why i love to do it at least a few times a week. It just keeps me grounded and clears my head of any petty problems im having. That and it continues to be the most beautiful scenery to look at.
When I look up I feel connected to all the humans that have ever existed who had a desire to look up at the night sky.   I feel inspired by all of those who figured out tiny little bits of it over eons to give me the whole picture of what I am looking at.  We might be insignificant but getting to this point of our understanding of the universe is a pretty amazing accomplishment if you ask me.   
I love KSC and what they did with the shuttle display. I need to get back there soon. Makes me hopeful we might just make it off this rock before we completely destroy it.
Great picture with amazing details. It boggles my mind that this thing was built and flew for the first time more than 30 years ago. From this point of view it still looks so "futuristic".
Now let's launch them into space one more time and throw them away in the Atlantic. ...

It's worth noting - those are not real RS25s....they're just mock ups.   Each shuttle exhibit got one real RS25 ( in the case of Atlantis, it was behind you when you took this picture)
Unfortunately those are only fakes. And the real ones are used and or sold else where 
400,000 pounds each? That's nearly as much thrust as I delivered to your mother last night.
Huh? It sounds exactly like she was tripping out after overdosing on sleeping pills. That's what too many can do to you, a bit like having waaay too much alcohol but without the cognition loss.
I was just hoping for the first account of someone going "space crazy."
Popular hypothesis include:

* Collision of two 2D Branes in 10D+ string space (M-Theory)

* Special black hole hypothesis (certain types of black holes in a 4D+ universe could create 3D+ universes)

* Quantum Foam / Holographic Universe (We don't live 'in' the universe, but rather on the topological surface)

* Big Bounce (the universe expands and contracts again in cycles)

* Computer simulation hypothesis (we are living in simulated universe)

And of course... there may be multiple ways universes can form.

Some of the above can be probed to see if they have basis (and in some cases such experiments are underway).
Before the Big Bang, the universe didn't exist. That's what it means to be in a singularity; time and space did not actually exist, until the singularity expanded.

How and why the singularity expanded is still a question, but even that question is muddled by the way we ask it; if we ask "why" then that implies there is consciousness and meaning and intent; the 'god' theory. If we ask "how", that implies there are ongoing mechanisms, and those mechanisms require time to exist, and time didn't exist. So really, asking about what happened "pre big bang" is a question that doesn't just have no answer, the question *itself* is meaningless; time *began* with the Big Bang. Without time existing, you can't ask what happened "before".

If that's confusing, just think about a big bowl full of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff.
Chalk it up to the Weak Anthropic Principle. If the universe didn't exist, we wouldn't be here to ask "How can the universe exist". So no matter how unlikely the odds of it "just existing", the fact that we ask the question shows that it does.
I personally believe that there does't have to be a reason. Maybe the universe just came into being without a cause. 
The most satisfying answer, to me at least, is that "nothing" is an inherently unstable state. "Nothing" takes energy. "Something" is more stable, ergo, we have "something".
Basically there was a big bang then the universe expands to a certain point and implodes causing another big bang.  (That was ment  to be one post but I have clumsy fingers)
I can't remember the exact theroy but isn't it something about it always existing and there being multiple big bangs. Basically 
i think that as long as its not just some single celled thing that the world will go crazy. even then the science community will go crazy over it
What would your reaction be a to a species that has sent other intelligent life extinct?  One that has despoiled its environment mainly just for the purpose of pointless wars.   

I think we have a long way to go before we are even worth contacting.
The way things are going, the most likely scenario is that we will find oceanic life in a saline water pocket underneath the surface of a moon of Jupiter. It'll probably be similar to Earthly algae, or, if it's growing near a geothermal vent, tubular or weedy. Science fiction won't do it justice.

Eventually, far far into the future, humanity will encounter more alien life forms. We can anticipate certain characteristics; some part of them will probably vibrate to produce sounds, some part of them will very likely be sensitive to light (probably not our visible wavelengths, though), they will likely have some musculature to move and something hard to hold the squishy bits together, they will probably have some measure of symmetry and/or remnants of segmentation (both of which were conducive to the success of early life on Earth), they should have some sort of information processing structure. Generic stuff. But within that, there are huge amounts of variation. Take any one of those and try to list all the Earthly examples; then, imagine any number of other biological possibilities.
If the aliens are smart enough to reach us, then they will know robotics.  If the aliens share our curiosity then they will have sent robots too.  

I think the first thing we find will not be life (replicating cellular life), but rather something that evidences advanced sentient life existing.  


Sheer probability dictates that we're more likely to encounter *unicellular* life or equivalent thereof.
EPZ (https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPlanetZero/) predicts that alien life will look like life on Earth.
In all likelihood alien life that we find will be prokaryotic and similar to extremophiles that we find on Earth. The science community would go absolutely nuts though, and it would still be a massive discovery 
It's interesting to note that if an alien species had the technology to get to us, they would already have the technology to destroy us. Stephen Hawking feels this way and has been theorizing on this for years. 

This does not speak to motivations behind finding us/coming here, though. Just because they can, doesn't mean they will. We can never accurately judge their motivations as they are alien, not human, and human/earth-life motivations are all we know. 

How do we understand something completely different from what we are? It's exciting to think about. If it came to it, I hope we learn from each other instead of trying to destroy them out of fear, or them just come down and destroy us. 
Well, I think it would be completely impossible to comprehend what any macroscopic alien life would look like. If it followed a different evolutionary path from a different source in a different environment, it wouldn't represent anything we've ever seen.
Finally some hope for fixing my crappy internet speed living in a rural area.

I've seriously contemplated moving just for better internet.
Premium sarellite internet plan for $20 more. It will follow the earth's rotation to stay on top of your house.
I'm science-dumb can someone help me?

When satellites are in orbit how do they keep with one place on earth? My question comes from them mentioning the first 800 would be for the US so I am wondering how they keep those within range. Do they use GPS guidance, is it natural for them to keep up at that distance, does it not matter where around the earth the satellites are, they somehow only get back to the US?
To ensure robots don't end up using access to the internet to take over the world, the satellites should only pass over during the day. At night, a gap in the satellites would no longer provide internet access.
86% of the planets population is covered with broadband.  14% of 7 billion is 980,000,000.  I guess that is pretty good.

But 4000 satellites is more than twice all the satellites in orbit now.  And they have to be completely refreshed every five years.  15.3 satellites a week, forever.

I suppose, if you could not sell the used rockets to customers then you could use them yourself that's for sure.

He does have a lot of land over there at the Fremont plant more than enough room to make car sized satellites.

I'm thinking the odds are long.

Would this plan go into action, would it not make future space endeavors extremely difficult? Is it not already reaaally crowded up there?
Don't forget leafy green vegetables, tomatoes, strawberries, beans, carrots, and so forth. 


There's also the possibility of setting up fish farms on Mars, which would be fed algae and insects and would be a welcome source of meat. Bugs are nutritious, but I'm certain they'd get boring pretty quickly. Being able to have some fried fish now and then will keep colonists happier. 
As tempting as the idea may be their definition of 'evidence' is a little loose.. It's a theory not an evidence. Have a probe over there dig under that rocky surface and then we might call that evidence.
Do you have any more information about this photo actually being taken during Earthrise (as opposed to Earthset)? I'm just curious and would love to know more.

[Here's the first picture](http://i.imgur.com/OISrrfl.png) of the Earth from the vicinity of the Moon, which was also taken by Lunar Orbiter 1, but from the perspective of the orbiter the Earth was setting (according to the diagram on [this page](http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/earth/earthrise-from-lunar-orbiter-1.html)).
back when earth was still black and white

I wonder when we are finally gonna colorize the moon
Nice. My stoned ass zoomed way in and I thought "whoa you can see the equator"

I facepalmed when I realized a) the obvious, there is no visible equator line like in globe maps and b) there's lines through the whole photo.

Just wanted to note that the moon's rotational period almost exactly matches its orbital period, so there wouldn't really be an "earthrise" or "earthset", just different views of Earth depending on your location on the moon.

Um is no one else acknowledging that little face in the crater that looks like jack skellington?! Wtf
Isn't the moon tidally locked? So surely there is no natural earth rise unless you are orbiting the moon? I know this picture is from orbit I'm just asking this question because there might be a cool awnser that someone might know thanks
Great photo. I hope all the other fans of The Office are thinking about Gabes experimental song titled "Earth Rise On The Moon".
I love the old film quality it adds so much too the feeling of history and majesty!
What's the scale if these craters on moon? For instance, the huge one  near the bottom left corner, how big is it comparative to cities or states?
How are the stars in the photo? Modern space photos don't have stars in them because of no exposure or something. Why are there stars here clearly visible?
The moon looks like Earth's little brother that hit puberty hard and never got his acne under control and ended up with pock marks. It's okay though, he's got a sweet personality and we love him.
I'm guessing this is a composite based on the lines and the numbers on the left. Is it long strips of horizontal film or squares?
Really makes you think. All humans who have ever lived did so on that ball over there. All life that we know of; dogs and dinosaurs and bears and megalodons. It's amazing how thousands of species evolved from the simplest life, all on that one planet. From the ocean we came. And now look at us. After millions of years, here we are - here you are - a wonderful descendant of that wondrous transformation. A descendant of the fish, of the microbes, of the stars.

Anyone know what part of the earth that is? Hard to see on my phone.
if the moon viewed from earth is about the size of a 50p (UK),held at arm length. the the earth view from the moon should be about 3 time the size... why is it not, this go for all the Earth view's from moon shots ???

Why does the earth look tiny when it's far larger than the moon and the moon generally looks bigger than that in the sky...
a story about [something else on the moon from these early pictures](https://youtu.be/7Clbn3zgsRs?t=22) from someone involved in USAF photographic reconnaissance / air tactical intelligence worker involved in relaying and processing of the images coming down from the moon mission to locate the first landing sites for the manned moon mission.

prettttttttty interesting story.
How come the earth look so small? The earth is much larger compared to the moon, shouldnt it look greater in the sky from the moon?
Has anyone ever heard of all those flat earth theories? They are so nutz. I like to keep an open mind on stuff, but, ugh... 

So does the Earth rise during the Moon's night or daytime along with the sun? Does the moon even have day/night cycles to begin with? It has to right? My head hurts now...
There is no earth rise nor set on the moon since it always faces the earth with the same side. 
Can someone please explain why we have so many different pictures of earth taken from the same point, the moon, and the earth is almost always a different size?
but if earth looks llike moon from the moon doesn't that mean earth is just as large as the moon?

Huh. Looks like Jack Skelinton's smiling face on that dark patch of the moon. No,  not stoned...
Question - the horizontal lines on the photograph - are they a result of how the image was taken?
I first read 'video' instead of 'photo'. You know what happened after that. 
Question of the day.... seeing that the earth is 4x the size of the moon, why would earth appear so small? Common sense would say that earth would appear huge from the moon...  Earth is 4x the size of the moon, so from the moon, earth would appear 4x larger than we see the moon from earth.... but no pictures ever show that.

Can someone explain why there is so much vertical space between the Earth and the moon? When we see "sunrise" or "moonrise", it's right at the horizon. I'm having trouble wrapping my brain around why there is so much space between the two objects. Is that the moon's shadow on the Earth? These probably seem like dumb questions, but I haven't had enough coffee today and am having trouble geometree-ing.
"This one is called 'Earthrise on the moon'" -Gabe to Andy


Any Office fans, ehh? ehh? 
The Earth is so tiny compared to the moon...looks can be deceiving at times....;)
Erm. Isn't the same face of the moon always facing the earth? No daily rotation would not allow to have the earth "rise"... though, if you didn't die from freezing or melting... you'd get to see the earth go through a day if you wanted to... once every 30? Days you'd get a sunrise/sunset cycle on the moon...

There's a black area on the bottom left side of the moon... zoom into it
I misread the title initially and thought this photo was from Pluto and I was very confused that we'd sent a probe to Pluto at all, plus why the Earth was so big and yet Jupiter was AWOL.
Per Ben Cooper's [website](http://launchphotography.com): Updates may also be found for some launches on a scanner at 146.9400, a local radio repeater which rebroadcasts the official launch coverage audio. This may also be on a delay depending on the launch.

It sounds a bit like a lot of asteroids and space debis flying by the audio sensor very quickly.  
But comparably in some spots it kind of sounds like a dishwasher or windshield wipers.  
Also what you hear when you playback audio from a mic without a pop filter.
Sounds like a paper bag caught in the wind and the recorded audio reversed and sped up.
So what is this sound representing in space? Where do you get it from?
Does anyone know what SpaceX plans to do with these dead satellites once the 5-7 year life-span ends?
There's some great speculation over at /r/spacex where people who actually follow this stuff are looking. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/5d9724/spacex_has_filed_for_their_massive_constellation/da2uf8v/) comment in particular does a pretty good breakdown of capabilities that spacex currently has. It takes a bit of an optimistic approach, but it gets the point across: SpaceX can and will do this. It's too profitable for them not to. 
I can see this quickly turning into a satellite debris catastrophe. Maybe we should try to take junk down with every new launch.

Where was this before I spent 14k for a fiber-coax plant to my house. 
Yeah, Musk has been talking about this for some time now, this is the first time he's dropped anything resembling actual details.

So at least we know the post-reality world will have post-reality global net service.

See, there are one or two problems with his cunning plan. When he first started blathering about this, I thought, "holy frak! Four thousand satellites? That's half the number of things we've EVER launched into space since the 1950s. And it's four times the number of currently active satellites. How could he *possibly* do that?"

 Aha," thinks I, "they're going to be little teensy micro-sats, so he can launch dozens at once!"

Nope:

>Each satellite in SpaceX's planned constellation will weigh about 850 pounds,    
>or 386 kilograms, and be roughly the size of a MINI Cooper car.    

Four thousand *full-sized* communications satellites? And just where does he plan to get the tens to hundreds of billions of dollars to do this? Selling his global internet service? 

Well, a couple of problems there.

First off, although he calls this "global internet service," you will need an antenna roughly the size of a satellite TV "pizza dish" to use it. So, you know, forget about using your laptop in the middle of the Gobi Desert. Sure, you could have a ground-based WiFi system that uses the sats as its backbone...if somebody coughed up the money to BUILD it.

And then there's the latency problem. Even with your big-ass antenna, you're still sending signals a significant distance into space and back (plus processing times). Latency is going to be a big problem. Forget about playing your MMO game or Skyping, VOIP, that kinda thing. And as land-based fiber-optic systems boost bandwidth and lower latency, people will come up with new ways to take advantage of that, and by the time Musk is even 1/4 of the way to putting his Grand Space Armada in place, it will be obsolete.

And the debris problem this will generate...I don't even wanna think about it.


They should also table a plan to clean them up should their company go under or they become obsolete.
What do they mean by "low latency"?  The distance just to  bounce off a satellite at their lowest orbit of 1150km is the same as the latency to cross the pacific.  That's just one hop.   While this is fine for communications it isn't usable for real  time applications (or gaming).
We need some more junk up there... wouldn't want anything to get through that wall of crap.
I like this success rate. Makes me happy to think that the JWST will launch with an Ariane 5.
Depends. Quite a nice set. I'd selfishly keep them.

If not, I'd either donate them to some place that would be thrilled to have them like the [Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum](https://www.evergreenmuseum.org/) (just because it's near me, find one you like) Or get them authenticated through someone like [PSA](
http://www.psacard.com/) and then either put them on eBay or an auction site.

One thing I WOULDN'T do is part them out. That's a really nice set, got Deke, Alan, Gus, all the ones people would look for. Gus especially, as he died on the pad on the first Apollo mission and there's likely not a ton of signed stuff from him.
 Would suggest a museum, I know that the Museum of flight in Seattle would love them (I leave near by and these would be cool to see in person) but if not, keep them and don't sell them, that is some awesome history
Watching right now!


So glad the launch is a success, I hope the rendezvous with the ISS will be smooth too
edit - wrong topic, my mistake

Good! 
Very simple stuff, dark energy = gravitational waste
What's the latency? I use to have Sat internet and I had a 500-800 MS ping.
And another step towards making the orbital debris environment even worse 
They took quite a big step away from it when that rocket blew up on the launchpad taking a satellite designed in part to do just that with it.
The ISS is older than a decade.  It's first bit was flown in 1998.  This makes the ISS 18 years old.

To answer your first question, it will *possibly* be replaced (but exactly what, nobody really knows, or if it will be replaced at all... at least, as an *International* space station, anyway), but not repaired to keep it up forever.

The ISS can be repaired in space, provided parts are sent up, just like it was built.  Just replace the bits that need replacing.  However, the main core units that were pushed up in the Shuttles or other means, those aren't getting replaced.  Just parts and small sub-modules.

ISS's planned end of mission is in 2024.  What is to be done with it is... [complicated.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station_program#End_of_Mission)  
NASA funding for ISS gets cut to zero in 2024. The plan last year was to let it burn up in 2020. Funding was extended to 2024. The Russians have said they will be separating their main modules before then and build their own station. This is with two large modules still planned to be added, behind schedule. NASA is completely out of Low Earth Orbit (LEO). They got additional funding this year to explore Deep Space Habitats, so two larger Bigelow sections are planned for the ISS in a couple years. Those Bigelow may be detached from the ISS in 2024, when a commercial main module may be around. NASA has turned over LEO to private enterprise and encouraged private enterprise tourism, research, products from orbit. The ISS is requiring a lot of maintenance and upkeep, plus adding more and more on. There are many space walks being made every year, hardly given any news notice. The last space walk was to put the standardized commercial docking port ring on a module. That will be the standardized docking port for SpaceX Dragon and Boeing Starliner Crew Capsules.
The bigger problems originate from general structural failure. Eventually parts too big to be delivered in a Dragon's trunk are going to begin to break down. Mir was a nightmare towards the end of her service.

It appears that Roscosmos and NASA are "talking about" ISS 2 and ISS 3 in *low lunar* and *highly elliptical lunar* orbits respectively.
As others have said, there's no clear answer. But given NASA and the federal government's clear push toward allowing private industry to handle LEO operations, I would speculate/hope that industry will build a next generation space station, and lease out space to governments. and private space agencies. This is one of Bigelow's goals

Since you seem to have an understanding of flairs and planets, unlike others that ask similar questions here, I can only suggest it's a helecopter's search light perhaps. Did you check [heavens above](http://www.heavens-above.com/) for passing satellites?


Are you near any military bases that may drop flairs on parachutes?

Edit: After looking at the picture, there's no other stars in I can see, which leads me to think its more man made and in the atmosphere.
I think it's Venus. It's incredibly bright in the Southwestern sky shortly after sunset right now. The position in the sky and the time you gave match up perfectly.
What in the world are you talking about? "Venus isn't that very bright"??? Venus is brighter than Jupiter and Mars...

It's slowly setting in a westward direction and it's really bright... it's Venus, dude.
Venus is, bar the moon, the brightest object in the night sky for a good portion of its orbit. Why would you think its too bright to be Venus?
It's Venus. Venus is actually the second brightest object in the night sky, far brighter then Saturn.
If you're sure Venus had set then I'm going to have to guess Mars, which I noticed the other night is particularly bright right now and in the right general area at that time. 
Bingo yep, crossing orbits. Most of the ISS impacts come from 30 to 60 degrees off the velocity vector. Even people on the program get confused by this, there is a spot on the truss behind the JLP that people expect to be protected by the structure but the debris comes from off sides so being behind the JLP is actually worse for debris risk. Check out http://stuffin.space which shows the tracked objects live 
You're right; if the two objects were in *exactly* the same orbit, they would never collide; if they were in slightly different orbits, their relative velocity would be very small, and the impacts would not be so severe.

While I'm not sure if any of those low-velocity impacts are recorded (for all I know they might be, but, they aren't worth reporting), it stands to reason that the high-velocity impacts occur because the debris is *not* in the same orbit. If, for example, the debris and the ISS were both orbiting the Earth at precisely the same altitude (a perfectly circular orbit), but one was in a polar orbit and one was in an equatorial orbit, you can immediately see that the impact will be at orbital velocity. Now, that's obviously not the scenario here, but if you reduce the difference in inclination you'll still have a high-velocity impact, until you reduce the inclination to near zero. Then you can start to consider objects that *aren't* in the same orbital space, but instead simply pass through it; say, for example, a geostationary transfer orbit. So on and so forth.

It's also worth noting that a bullet can travel at speeds around 800 meters per second; orbital velocity is on the order of 8,000 meters per second. If you get a paint fleck moving at only one-tenth the orbital velocity relative to the space station, it's going to be damaging. And one-tenth is not a lot.
>1) I think we always launch rockets in the same direction to have the small boot from the Earth rotation 

Except for Israel. Those guys launch retrograde (i.e. westward).

>What I don't understand in this case is the fact that is the screw (or small piece of satellite junk) is able to collide the ISS, it means it has the same altitude, and if it has the same altitude, it means they are going at the same speed. So the _relative speed _ between the space junk and the satellite / ISS / whatever should be very close to 0.

You're assuming identical inclination and identical eccentricity. Not all orbits are circular, and they aren't in the same plane. So, imagine ISS in its low orbit at 51.64^o inclination, and you've got a bunch of screws released by an old Soviet Molniya satellite that had an inclination of 63.4^o and is coming down from its apogee of 40000 km. 40000, not 400 km. As you can guess, by the time it falls to the low point in its orbit, it's going to be *moving*, at about twice the velocity of the ISS. There are plenty of satellites in full polar orbits (90^o inclination).

Here's an example. In 2009, Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251 rammed into each other. [Here's a map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Collision_iridium33_kosmos2251.jpg).

A launch replay of today's mission starting from t minus 1 minute through to payload fairing separation. 

For those of you who don't know, an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket launched earlier today from the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, South America, to bring four Galileo navigation satellites to orbit. The Galileo constellation is much like GPS and will allow users to track their position on Earth once it becomes operational. With today's launch, 18 of the requisite 24 satellites are in orbit.

This was actually a somewhat rare morning launch for Ariane 5. Because it is normally used to launch communications satellites to GTO, Ariane 5s often launch in the late evening/nighttime, so being able to watch one launch in the daylight was a good change of pace. Additionally, this Ariane 5 was flying in an ES configuration with a shorter payload fairing, giving the rocket a much stockier look than the normal [ECA variant](http://i.imgur.com/44Y7pFn.jpg).
That is one angry ball of fire.

Incidentally, when are we going to do Mercury lander? There is ice on it. come on...
This is from STEREO observatory. MESSENGER couldn't photograph the sun, it didn't have appropriate filters for that.
NASA administrator is a political appointment?

That seems like a poor way to lead a long range agency like NASA.
Considering all his other selections so far have been party insiders and/or career politicians, it will definitely not be an "agent of change".  It will be whatever republican he either owes or needs a favor from, just like the rest of his administration. 
I truly hope an "insider" so we stop wasting so much time, effort, and money by changing our mind all the time. Cancelling the Constellation program after so much had gone into it was so wasteful. I really truly wish to see NASA as an independent agency.

Explanation: Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, this Soyuz rocket stands on the launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on November 14. Beyond it rises a supermoon, but fame for exceptional feats of speed, strength, and agility is not the reason November's Full Moon was given this popular name. Instead, whenever a Full Moon shines near perigee, the closest point in its elliptical orbit around Earth, it appears larger and brighter than other more distant Full Moons, and so a supermoon is born. In fact, November's supermoon was the second of three consecutive supermoons in 2016. It was also the closest and most superest Full Moon since 1948. Meanwhile, the mild mannered Soyuz rocket is scheduled to launch its Expedition 50/51 crew to the International Space Station today, November 17.
I wonder if Korolev ever imagined his R-7 / Soyuz 7K design would still be taking people to space fifty years after it first flew. 

Fifty years ago, on November 28th 1966, the first Soyuz launched from the same pad at Baikonur (unmanned). 
[removed]
Crazy to me that these Soyuz launches to the ISS don't see more coverage and commenting on here. This is the only method of launching humans into space currently. You would think people would be more excited about it 
I like it a lot but... Initially was a tiny bit disappointed that it vvasn't 'major tom'
Even stole the title:

Misleading, as this is not a single shot. This is the result of multiple long exposures stacked in processing. 

Still great picture though. 
Guys, check the date it was taken on the 22nd of Aug 2015. not yesterday.
Amazing shot man. Love that constellation. If I don't mind me asking what gear are you using
Very nice photo!  Pleiades is one of my favorite constellations to find and look at in the night sky.  Interesting to see it so up close!
It's refreshing to see an educator so stoked to get kids into the mindset of forging the future of space exploration. Wish I was half as cool as this guy
Isn't this just an artistic depiction? Jupiter doesn't spin that fast in real time and Juno's cameras aren't held up by cameramen with palsy.

edit: also Juno doesn't even have video capabilities; static shots are just stitched together to make GIFs.
This video was posted by a youtube channel dedicated to fake UFO videos. The original video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=866RMt4IT5s
It's just another video counter-productive to scientific and human progress.
If it doesn't have a NASA or JPL pedigree, a simulation seems pretty likely.  Plus, the video looks nothing like the images released by NASA/JPL/SWRI ... https://twitter.com/NASAJuno
The camera shake is some one holding a camera to their computer screen. 
Notice how the plus signs that divide the image shake at the same rate as the image.
I'm guessing this is a composite with real photos and animation in between, and the shaky cam is supposed to make all the jagged edges less noticeable? Like someone did with the mars lander.

>Following the spill, the length of shoreline that receded more than 13 feet (4 meters) a year quadrupled compared to the year before the spill. The land losses occurred mainly in areas where oil had washed ashore during the spill.  
  
   
Holy shit.  Does that mean there are areas of shoreline that have receded 60+ feet since 2010 as a result of this spill?
What does this have to do with Space/Astronomy/Cosmology? The study didn't even use satellite data, it used UAVs to collect data.
In addition to the issues Juno has had, people need to understand that 1) Taking pictures is not Juno's primary mission. and 2) Juno is currently in a very long orbit, almost two months long, and it will only be taking pictures when very close to Jupiter. That means even if everything works perfectly, pictures will only be taken about every month and a half.
Might have something to do with them missing the insertion window. Seem to recall something along those lines anyways. The probe went into "safe mode" and didn't execute its burn IIRC. 
[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/5beu8k/will_there_be_any_more_pictures_from_the_juno/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/5arax8/what_is_up_with_juno/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/5djl4p/what_ever_happened_to_high_res_juno_pics/) etc

Juno encountered some issues in the past month, delaying science operations.  It sounds like they'll start up again once they correct the orbit at the next approach. 
I know for a fact it has the pictures on board already, but for some reason they're waiting for the data dump, and the latest delays affected it more. 
Doubtful. These flights require a commercial-style airliner, but it's hard on the airframe and requires a decent pilot to avert disaster.

I'd say it's reasonably priced already.
I've done Zero-G.  Once I did my first flight, they offered additional flights for half price.
Feasible, yes, economic, no. This will require tremendous redesign to mate the mission stack from one design to another booster, even assuming that mechanical stresses align (for instance, when building the Polyus battlestation with off-the-shelf parts, the Soviet ended up having to launch it upside down) and electrical and computer systems don't conflict.

Real-life rockets don't come in internationally standardized diameters, my kerb.
Ariane V is human-rated, they just never used it as such because the Hermes space plane was canceled for budgetary reasons.
ESA launches Soyuz rockets now too, from the same launch site as Ariane 5. It would likely be simpler to integrate the Soyuz spacecraft into the Soyuz-2, which already launches Progress cargo ships, than Ariane 5.
This was studied at one point. Payload interfaces, coupled loads, and payload capacity all work, though it would need a new fairing design. The big issue is launch location. Arianespace only has launch facilities at Guiana, and the launch goes over the ocean so in an abort the capsule would have to splash down. This turns out to be quite problematic, Soyuz is designed for at most shallow lake landings, ideally solid land. And theres not many other facilities in the world that launch over land outside Russia.
All things considered, it's implausible. Australian aerospace industry is non-existent.

And it wouldn't be the first time BBC [made a doozy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLCmC01HjJE).
I didn't realize just how big this rover was. That was quite a feat! Too bad Russia is not doing more exploration with rovers.
Space rocket "Soyuz-FG" with transport manned spacecraft of a new modification of "Soyuz MS-03".

The Baikonur Cosmodrome. PL. 1. Launch date - November 17, 2016, 23:20:13 (GMT).

The crew commander Oleg Novitsky (Roscosmos), flight engineers Thomas Pesquet (ESA) and Peggy Whitson (NASA).
> In 1964 a team of the Saint-Petersburg Polytechnic University headed by Dr. Eugene Yurevich was tasked to develop a gamma-ray altimeter (GRA) for the new Soyuz. A GRA measures the photon backscatter from ground resulting from the transmission of photons from a cobalt-60 gamma source. The gamma-ray altimeter records the distance to the ground and at just 1.5 meters it triggers the soft landing engines to slow down the capsule to 2.6-1.4 m/s impact which is also absorbed by the seat damping system.

I’m open for book recommendations on the Soyus.
What’d be the equivalent of “How the Apollo flew to
the Moon”?
I clicked on this thinking it was a HFY, but since I'm here...

To answer this, we have to define what kind of signals we're talking about. Frequency, amplitude, type of broadcast (vague, I know), and direction are all important. 

So which signal is on the front of the expanding signal-bubble? If your TV signal is all snow, and your youtube video is forever buffering, would you say you were "receiving the signal?" Carl Sagan and the movie *Contact* say it was Hitler's Olympic address, because it was high enough frequency to penetrate the solar winds and escape relatively unharmed from our solar system, but its amplitude was low. It also doesn't help that this was omnidirectional, so the amplitude decreases at a square of the distance. Many people think this signal won't be "receivable."

How about [the Arecibo Message?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) *that* was high frequency and amplitude, but was also sent directionally with a reflecting disc to a certain globular star cluster. Aliens will probably only get that one in less than 25 thousand years if they happen to move into the open space between our star and that cluster, and also listen in our direction. *And* have some resources devoted to scanning data for non-natural patterns *and* can figure out that space-invaders-looking message. Seriously 70's people, that's not a message, that's a sprite-map.

So....let's say 40-80 light years, tops? As time marches along, we have fewer radio broadcasts, and more "shout at a star to find aliens" broadcasts, so that bubble gets a little bumpy and uneven too.

Here's a [top down galactic map](https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/universe/20130115_radio_broadcasts_f840.jpg) with 200 light years as the little blue dot in the close-up of the ~~Sagittarius~~ **ORION** arm. It makes sense to look at it top down; at this distance the galactic plane is pretty flat. So...a galactic map doesn't really work. Our broadcasts haven't made it far enough to really even be a blip on the galactic radar.

If you imagine that blue dot expanding into these two maps: at [20 light years](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/20lys.html), and [50 light years](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/50lys.html), you can start to see the stars that could possibly hear us.

From there it's a mater of determining which is "the first hear-able broadcast."  Which one were you thinking?
This website is pretty cool and shows I think what you're asking for. http://www.lightyear.fm/
This guy is getting to be a real downer. Deadline for our own destruction, [unable to cope with aliens](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/nation-now/2016/09/23/stephen-hawking-aliens-wary-answering-back-intelligent-life/90895018/) if contacted, [god particle could wipe out the universe](http://www.livescience.com/47737-stephen-hawking-higgs-boson-universe-doomsday.html). 
Here lies the problem. We live in the "me, me, me" era and majority people think "I won't even be alive in 1k years, why should I care?" No regards for future humans.  
Washington Post.... Just as bad as the Onion with their sub-par journalism.
I think this is clickbate but at the same time 1000 years is incredibly optimistic for humans to remain on this planet but the next 20 years will be significantly  telling. 
Doesn't SpaceX plan to have people on mars by 2025 and have a colony by 2035?  I think Hawking is overly pessimistic about humanities capability to do this because unlike the conman behind mars one, Elon Musk is brilliant and not full of shit.  

Even if Hawking was talking about going to an exoplanet, that still seems a bit pessimistic towards humans in thinking we wouldn't have the capabilities to colonize Proxima b or GJ 667 C e/f in 1000 years.  Think of how much technology improves each decade, I'm sure we will make it to the stars unless we destroy ourselves in some apocalypse. 
1000 years. Not 900? Not 1010? For a scientist he doesn't seem to have arrived at this number by calculations.  Show your work.
Very cool to see some successful testing of the ITS hardware. It's one thing for someone to declare they're going to mars and here is their roadmap... its another thing entirely to go the full step of actually building and testing hardware, from their scaled version of a fully functional Raptor methalox engine, to this fully carbon-composite tank. They've got a long way to go, but they're a lot farther than anyone else running in this game. 

For now however, their real next steps will be RTF next month, and hopefully the debut of the FH early-ish next year (i'm cautiously optimistic for March or April- The hardware of both the rocket and the launch pad itself are finally done- unlike in past years when it was supposed to launch)
Is space X really pushing to get the ITS done? In other words , can I expect to see or hear about more hardware tests in the near future? (Space X has so much going on.dragon 2,  About to head into crew flights, still no FH , gotta actually get back to flying, ITS) 
Works only with HTC Vive. Too bad it's very expensive and requires also a very expensive PC. But with software like this we can progress towards vr and make the hardware much cheaper.

>Is the heart and soul of our Galaxy located in Cassiopeia? Possibly not, but that is where two bright emission nebulas nicknamed Heart and Soul can be found. The Heart Nebula, officially dubbed IC 1805 and visible in the featured image on the right, has a shape reminiscent of a classical heart symbol. Both nebulas shine brightly in the red light of energized hydrogen. Several young open clusters of stars populate the image and are visible here in blue, including the nebula centers. Light takes about 6,000 years to reach us from these nebulas, which together span roughly 300 light years. Studies of stars and clusters like those found in the Heart and Soul Nebulas have focused on how massive stars form and how they affect their environment.
The one on the right looks like it has finished chargin its lazer and is about to shoop da whoop

Upvoted, saved and leaving a comment so I can find this again with ease to refer to those photos of the space shuttles.  Cheers OP
What's your source? I think it would be cool to go there and drill. Get a camera in that ocean.
I think like most politicians and grandiose space exploration plans its vague enough and the end goal is far enough out he can make the claim he cares and we will go but continuously out off actually asking Congress for money to do it nominally leaving the real work for the next guy but in reality nothing will happen. Its the equivalent of [Bush plans to go to Mars](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/space/01/14/bush.space/) which were nothing like [his fathers plans](http://history.nasa.gov/sei.htm) to go to Mars from 15 years before. 
I feel a lot like [Charlie Brown](http://i.imgur.com/ofEX5Eg.gifv), and every new administration is Lucy.
The only thing I take from any of these interests is Trump using them as a way of cutting NASA research and monitoring of the environment because he's an anti-global climate change believer.  That's all this is, nothing more, a way of trying to build support for other items so he pull the rug on those efforts.  I honestly don't believe he cares a single iota about space research unless somehow it benefits him financially.
Shows us that they're not infallible.

>There is no such thing as “human/alien DNA research” because we have never encountered any aliens.

That's what THEY want you to think.

>Spiers was found dead on a sofa at a friend’s house in Poland days after warning his mother to “investigate” if anything happened to him. Friends also claim he had vomited a black liquid before his death.

What happened to using locally avilable tools?
Old woman got hysterical, that's all, its gender specific you know
i dont really know why they want to build everything on the surface?
Would it not be a better idea to build everything inside of the moon?
We need to leave everything on the moon and use it locally. If we lighten the mass its orbit will begin to alter. That would be bad for us if you didnt understand.
The delta_v requirements are nearly the same as for a ground-based launch. The only advantage is the thinner atmosphere, which makes it easier to launch smaller rockets. Smaller rockets are cheaper per launch, but more expensive per kilogram. That is not "space for the masses". It is space for small satellites that cannot be launched together with larger payloads on larger rockets (the cheapest launch option). It is maybe "stratosphere for the masses". A nearly black sky, a nice view - great, but not space.
Ole Steve the Sock Puppet may have given us too much credit. I'll be surprised if I even make it past my lifetime.

Well in fairness to our Sun, you kind of let go a bit on the sides after you have had nine kids.
>Stars are not perfect spheres. While they rotate, they become flat due to the centrifugal force.

They bulge at the equator but they don't *become flat,* that makes it sound like the stars are disks.
In twelve hours, an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket is set to launch four satellites for Europe's Galileo navigation constellation. Once complete, the Galileo constellation will provide worldwide navigation services via 24 satellites (plus spares) orbiting some ~23,000 km above Earth. Currently, there are 14 Galileo satellites in orbit (all launched on previous Arianespace flights), and tomorrow's launch will bring that number up to 18, allowing for the start of preliminary operations. This will be the first time Arianespace is using an Ariane 5 rocket to launch Galileo satellites, having been launched on Soyuz rockets.

You can read all about the launch in the launch thread that this post links to. Feel free to ask questions and discuss the launch, and be sure to tune in to the listed livestreams to watch the launch with other fans.
Why is this a thing now? At first it was "When this post is four hours old..." now it's up to 12.

I wonder if Gravitational Waves can give some insight into the formation of these "strange stars".
The heart was the first thing i noticed when i saw the New Horizon pictures for the first time. [It instantly jumps out at you, even in the earliest pictures that NASA released of Pluto that showed any significant details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYDwhc4hwAk). Prior to New Horizons arriving, it always seemed to me that artists depicted Pluto as a dull icy world with little beauty to it. I'm glad that nature provided the exact opposite, a fascinating world with a multitude of colors and terrains that tantalize the eye of those who behold it.
Is it me or does it look like we're finding (or at least suspecting) new subterraneans oceans left and right these days?
Way we are going we are going to wonder if there is life everywhere. 
>Keane's team suggested that the basin's thick layers of ice, deposited over millions or billions of years, combined with ejecta from the impact that created the basin, might have made Sputnik Planitia heavy enough to migrate.

I'd love to know what's really going on there as I'm sure it's an amazing and beautiful natural process...but in the mean time please label your best guess as such. Thanks..
What is the source of that blue haze?
is it an early earth rise or just a lense flare?

[Hasselblad](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--OFFK7Kc4--/18vvs1akf70hgjpg.jpg) made the moon cameras.

Hasselblad has a going offer to replace the film backs if anyone goes up and gets the cameras.
That sense of dread when you start imagining how deep the water is below you while out on the ocean....just from glancing at this for a second. Unreal.
The Moon has an atmosphere? How is the light bouncing from Earth creating a glow in the horizon?
That can't be possible. The universe is so expansive that it would take to people years to find each other!

Is anyone else bothered by the misleading title? This is not another world, it is a major satellite orbiting what we call the actual world that we originate from.
I noticed that some older space photos have those dark pluses on them. What is the purpose of them?
What apollo mission was this? Cool seeing the blue radiance from earth in the background. 
And they aren't even ripping each other to shreds about who will get to mine the resources. A rare shot, must've been in the early stages of settlement.
This will happen on another planet that's in orbit around another sun. How far into the future will that be? 100 years? 1000? Too bad its not during my lifetime because I would like nothing more than to pilot a blockade running freighter to smuggle Earth grown cannabis to the outer rim.

I would give ten years off my life just to be there for ten minutes 
look like the shadows of two scarecrows, wonder what they are doing away from the farm.
Did anyone read the book 'who built the moon' by Christorper Knight and Alan Butler?
And here I was reading "too human" and finally hoping for our sequel. Damn you
My mind automatically added "fighting" to the title and I got excited.

Now I'm disappointed.
Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god

Wandering, wandering in hopless night

Out here in the perimeter there are no stars

Out here we IS stoned

Immaculate.
For some reason the geometric arrows/pointers disappear to my eye when I zoom in slightly on the picture. Very strange
If the astronauts squated down and tried to pick dirt, would it be like at the beach or more like compacted dirt?
No matter how hard those two travellers tried they couldn't re populate humanity on that desert world. 
The moon alien race contacted them, they warned us to never go back.
Is no one going to mention that the shadows look like two penguins on an easel?

"Despite the twin shadows, the astronaut reported the rest of his crew were in the landing craft at the time this image was taken." 
Weird visual effect where the shadows look like they extend halfway to the horizon. 
Wow. As an amateur astronomer I've seen many space photos, but this one hits a different nerve. Something about the POV perspective gets me; it's as if I'm taking the photo and seeing my own shadow on a world that has likely never been graced by a human shadow. I can almost feel the sense of wonder that these astronauts must have felt in this moment. 

What went wrong? Like if we were able to do this back in the 60s, shouldn't we have a ship headed out into deep space now with an international crew?
Man, stuff like this will never cease to make me just....take a second and breathe. It's one of the most awe inspiring things there is.
Its incredible what we can achieve as a species when we work together.
I thought this was two birds sitting on a sawhorse. Took me 30 secs to actually see it.
Such an achievement and picture! What is the over/under that we see a  comparable explorative image/achievement again in our lifetime?
Pete Conrad and Al Bean on Apollo 12 had a self timer for their Hasselblad cameras which they intended to use to take an actual photo of the two of them standing side by side but they lost the timer in a bag and only found it when it was too late.
Moon is full of new things. I will go there to explore the new world
Pictures like this always give me chills (In a positive way of course). Just one simple photo but full of achievements.
What is the source of the blue dot with light cloud splashing off of it on the center left side? Is that Neptune or something?
I'll see your *TWO* humans on Another World and raise you another human on  Another World.

Beat that, OP
Absolutely amazing! I've always wondered how it must have felt for the lucky few who stepped foot on the Moon. To come to the realization that you are on the Moon must be an incredible feeling.
Looking at this picture and you can't help thinking the childlike sense of wonder these two men shared in that moment. Judging by the photo they probably were chanting "We did it!"
Didn't someone else just post this yesterday with a title "two shadows on the moon"?
Reminds me of The Dig game, what an awesome adventure game..

It's absolutely fascinating just looking at the rocks in this picture. I mean come on! There's no way we're the only form of life in this universe, just looking at those rocks makes me feel like something else is out there.
Thinking about taking this girl I just met there on a first date.  Anything I should consider?
The feeling of discovering something and pioneering into what no man has seen before is truly a feeling unlike any other.
the shadows are real but the moon isnt. this looks literally like right outside my house. literally im looking out my window and i see this exact same thing. 
The moon is not a world......

It orbits the EARTH.....

It is not a planet.

If the moon is a sphere then why is there no curvature on the horizon?
ATTENTION OP: If Pluto can't be called a Planet, than you can't call the moon a world.
I dont think its real.......and i think  the blue shade in picture is due to photo editor effect.....
Too bad this picture isn't real cuz the moon landing was faked to win the space race.
Hey, I can see stars in that photograph!  

Or are those stage lights..........

*sigh*...  Plainly obvious that all those extra periods were to signify sarcasm, jerks.
This is so fake. If you look closely at the cross hairs you'll see that they wouldn't be there because cameras only existed in Nazi Russia then.
This picture seems so staged to me. Forget what we were told for a minute and take this photograph out of context. Look at the shadows on the left, middle and right side. Take a really close look. On the left side of the picture, the shadows are pointing towards the top right of the picture. And on the right side of the picture, the shadows are pointing towards the top left of the picture. The center of the picture, the shadows run vertically, straight up and down. This photograph clearly appears to have 3 light sources to make the shadows cast in 3 different directions. 
Judging by the plus signs all over the screen, I'd say this is staged.
Funny how a bunch of self-proclaimed "science experts" have no problem with shadows going at multiple angles.


Technically same 'World' just different planet, or studio, whatever theory tickles your tockles.
What is the point of the plus signs in photos taken on the moon? You would think that you wouldn't want to cover possible data that might be useful with a fucking plus sign. 
Maybe we shouldn't be treating as disposible the world to which we are already perfectly adapted.
I personally think we have about 250 years after that civilization will have retrograded into a form not capable of getting off the planet.
This article sucks... not very substantial or explanatory at all...

From a [different article](http://themindunleashed.com/2016/03/mysterious-object-that-came-out-of-a-black-hole-has-just-been-measured.html):

>So what exactly happened?  Well as two of NASA’s space telescopes, which included the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array or (NuSTAR) for short, were observing this particular black hole, a large object very suddenly “launched” itself away from the middle or “corona” of the black hole. Right after this remarkable event a massive pulse of X-ray energy spewed forth from the corona.  This event seems to have the scientists of earth completely baffled.  

>To Fiona Harrison, who is the principal investigator for NuSTAR, made a strong note saying that this type of phenomenon is unheard of and completely changes what we originally thought about how black holes function. Luckily with the level of technology that we as a race have been able to achieve, we were able to record this event. The data from this should provide now, some much-needed clues to just how black holes function and how they are structured.





And:

>So in short, it seems that we have been able to observe a phenomenon that has completely changed how we thought black holes functioned.  An object actually exited the corona of the black hole and afterwards a flare of x-ray energy followed suit, leaving us completely baffled.




And from [another article](http://www.zmescience.com/science/black-hole-corona-ejection-09112015/):

>“The corona gathered inward at first and then launched upwards like a jet,” said Wilkins. “We still don’t know how jets in black holes form, but it’s an exciting possibility that this black hole’s corona was beginning to form the base of a jet before it collapsed.”

>“The nature of the energetic source of X-rays we call the corona is mysterious, but now with the ability to see dramatic changes like this we are getting clues about its size and structure,” said Fiona Harrison, the principal investigator of NuSTAR at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who was not affiliated with the study.




So basically.... it sounds like a burst of energy came out of the black hole. Which is impressive, since (virtually) nothing, not even EM energy is supposed to escape the gravity of a blackhole. But in short, nobody knows what it is and it doesn't seem like anybody is even offering a hypothesis yet (unless I missed something).





Edit: a word
I'll wait for Stephen Hawking to explain it to Neil Degrasse Tyson so he can explain it to me.
I really wish they'd remember to put "artists rendering" notations on images like those.  They always end up all over social media, with people not understanding that they aren't real.
Black holes are often surrounded by a cloud of debris that are very energetic. This can emit x-rays and mass can be ejected away. It's not leaving the black hole itself, just the mass of stuff orbiting it closely.
Probably a spacecraft filled with beings from another universe. Since black holes are gateways between each universe in the multiverse
The way i see it, there's really only two possibilities. 1. Spock v Nero. 2. An earthly time traveler from way in the future when time travel exists decided to find a wormhole exiting through a black hole 325 million light years away which the traveler knew earthlings from our time would have a telescope focused on. Probably Spock, though. 
Article says nothing else. "two telescopes observed something, black hole related."

Can someone please science the shit out if this for me? ELIApostgraddoctorateinastrophysics? 
According to the illustrations and what I read, nothing came out of the event horizon (which would violate physics as we know it). Instead, this was the corona (an area above and below) which is a source of x-rays seemingly reforming and then relaunching as a jet. So it didn't come "out" of a black hole, but it came out of the coronal area surrounding the black hole. Interesting, but not earth-shattering. It's like they saw how the black hole jets form, like suddenly seeing a slow-motion video of a bullet exiting a gun.
Nothing escapes black holes... this just in.. objects coming out of black holes!

So annoying.. it's like the science writers don't know anything about science
Did it come out of the event horizon? If it didn't, then what's with all the hub-ub? 
ITS HAPPENINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG! THE ENTERPRISE CAME THROUGH FROM ANOTHER TIME/UNIVERSE FINALLY... oh god... their too late though trumps president and half the world hates the other half
So that's what it feels like realising that all we know is shit.

Great.
I mean this is probably an absurd piss into the wind...but does anyone have any idea now, as to how X Rays can be used to "transport" an object? Or is this a literal 'da fuq' moment? 


This doesn't sound like anything new to me, unless I am completely mistaken?

Things inside of the EVENT HORIZON cannot escape, but that isn't to say an accretion disk orbiting the black hole at super-high velocity couldn't eject matter, as it would not be inside the event horizon.

Another annoying thing in the article is that it claims black holes are known for sucking things in, but again this is not the case - outside of the event horizon gravity behaves in very much the same way as around stars. Only when you get too close would you be unable to escape - and even then it is not so much 'sucking in' as rather you can only travel towards the centre.

Checked this on the news, seems like there's an article like this every year. Not sure if this is authentic or just a deliberate repackaging of a known phenomenon 
“NASA observes object coming out of black hole "Markarian 335"
Oh no! Since if true, (big) bang goes another theory.

> The difference of 3km, between the polar and equatorial radii, is tiny compared to the star's mean radius of 1.5 million km.

Super interesting, almost perfectly round.

Explanation: Is the heart and soul of our Galaxy located in Cassiopeia? Possibly not, but that is where two bright emission nebulas nicknamed Heart and Soul can be found. The Heart Nebula, officially dubbed IC 1805 and visible in the featured image on the right, has a shape reminiscent of a classical heart symbol. Both nebulas shine brightly in the red light of energized hydrogen. Several young open clusters of stars populate the image and are visible here in blue, including the nebula centers. Light takes about 6,000 years to reach us from these nebulas, which together span roughly 300 light years. Studies of stars and clusters like those found in the Heart and Soul Nebulas have focused on how massive stars form and how they affect their environment.
Comfy? COMFY!? How can you spend one minute resting in there with such constant motivation?
I really like the color of your wall bro! Does this color have a name?

The posters are pretty cool too! :)
I also wanted this but that means I also had to put it above my bed... I'm really afraid that they're going to fall on me. Because of fracking in my province (not in the US), there are earthquakes. Not as much anymore because of all the protests and them needing to pay for any damage, but still I find it very scary.

However, I have not seen these posters yet... Are these new, or did I miss something? 

It looks very good OP! Also, the green wall, the lights, the color of the bed and nightstand are looking very good :)
If anyone is interested, there is a post on imgur of an abandoned hangar with several pictures of 2 of the Buran craft inside slowly going to ruin.

http://imgur.com/gallery/b70VK
Source for the picture is the amazing resource "Buran.ru". [Here is a link to pictures](http://www.buran.ru/htm/foto4.htm) of the system before its first and only flight. Browse the numbers on top for more pictures. The carrier rocket itself, called Energia, had two flights in total. Buran flight was its second and last flight, [first one was carrying a space based laser weapon called "Polus".](http://i.imgur.com/PmzNgeq.jpg)

Let us all appreciate the engineering feat of both Energia and Buran despite the country and system it was made in. Tens of thousands of hardworking people were involved in this project, hundreds of thousands of tests had to be done and hundreds of new materials had to be invented. Many people in Russia in one way or another know someone that was involved in this massive countrywide undertaking. One of my uncles for example was involved in production of the screens and other electronics used in Buran's cockpit.

EDIT; I tried to write a post focusing on tends of thousands of people who used a decade of their life on this undertaking. Of course as usual r/space steps up to the plate with absolute shitposts of comments within 10 min of my post, basically by taking a dump on all those that pushed science forward with this project. Stay classy, r/space. (sorry for being salty, but there is a reason why many consider quality at r/space to be absolutely abysmal) 
I just learned about the Buran in one of my classes!

IMO, the coolest part about this spacecraft was that its one and only flight was completely unmanned.  Which, if i'm not mistaken, the United States shuttles were capable of, but never did.
And now a copy of Buran is standing in Moscow, at the VDNKh expo. You can even get inside and have a look around: http://vdnh.ru/en/events/exhibitions/interactive-museum-complex-buran/
I find it interesting how similar it looks to what we had going over here. Seems like two paths to the same destination. Though I realize I can only see the most simplistic elements in the photos, and I imagine the "guts" are enormously different. 
Sad story. The only Lithuanian cosmonaut was scheduled to fly Buran. He was killed in a plane crash in an airshow in 1990...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimantas_Stankevi%C4%8Dius
I may not be a fan of the current Russian government, but I respect the fuck out of Russian scientists.  
My grandfather was somehow involved into making this thing take off. He was an engineer - sadly, he passed away in my childhood, so I have not heard his stories about it, neither he told it to anybody else - this all was strictly secret, and, as far as I can remember, he was not even a talkative person at all. The only evidience left is an old pre-take off photo of Buran and Energia on Baikonur launching site. It is ink-signed by the main constructor, the sign says: "Friends, thank you for the great adventure we had". I suppose, it was signed after the landing. Here is a picture of my older brother holding this picture. [the photo I am telling about](https://pp.vk.me/c636129/v636129280/2a31b/agYqPp7Qjo4.jpg)

When you think about it, the Energia sure does look like the Ariane 5
Really? I never knew it flew except on the back of large airplanes. 
It was very impressive, but like the US Space Shuttle it was incredibly expensive and didn't really live up to the design goals of being a fully reusable craft.  Still, it would have been cool to see two different shuttles flying at the same time.
Hey it's on one of the N1 pads! Didn't know Energia flew out of those. The triple flame trench looks so cool just after ignition:

http://imgur.com/a/XguXZ
I respect all scientists, engineers and technicians. Building this thing was an accomplishment worthy of great respect!

But now, with 20-20 hindsight, we realize the shuttle was a flawed design

Looks like the Soviet engineers copied a flawed design (probably for political purposes)

Good thing they abandoned that useless vehicle, otherwise we wouldn't have any functional space station now.
What does CCCP stands for? I get CP at the end is probably for communist party. 
RIP russia shuttle. I am curious to see how it's doing these days, if it was mothballed 
It was a great program, she didn't have the cross range of our girls, but their design changes as they had very poor SRB experience at the time really intrigued us at NASA as we were recovering from Challenger and making our own modifications.
His really happened? Like, it actually flew into outer space? Not bad. Wonder why they don't pick up on this project again. 
Good post, the Buran is a fascinating chapter of space history. You can see a [Buran vehicle](http://worldtravels.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_1480.jpg) and even get [inside](http://worldtravels.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_1488.jpg) it at the Baikonur Cosmodrome Museum in Kazakhstan. You can also visit the [Energia-Buran launch pad](http://worldtravels.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_1269.jpg) which is really [cool](http://worldtravels.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DSC_1289.jpg), and a ton of other space infrastructure and equipment during a tour of the [Baikonur cosmodrome](http://worldtravels.ro/?p=3129). 


Energia and Buran both look incredible. I especially like Energia's design.
How much would it cost to buy the abandoned building and it's contents?
I always love seeing how grungy even brand-new Soviet construction looked. Marxism is completely pathetic.
The Starliner Crew Capsule looks like it is having difficulties but both Boeing and SpaceX recently confirmed commitment to be operational by Spring 2018. That means both test prototypes should be unveiled early next year.
"In Washington state, Boeing expects “few if any job losses from today’s announcement,” said spokesman Ken Smith.

However, about 1,000 defense-side workers will be moved from the company’s Kent site, which has been shrinking for some years, to Tukwila."

All things considered, could be a lot worse for us. To all those who have to commute further: HTH
I almost went to Kennedy a few weeks ago, during my vacation in Orlando. Plans got rearranged because of the hurricane, so KSC unfortunately got dropped from the agenda. I had heard about this exhibit and was wondering if I would be able to take my son (5) through it. Not because of what it would do to him to see it, but because I wasn't sure if I wanted him to see me break down in tears in a museum. I was eleven when Challenger was destroyed, and it still hurts in a big way when I think about it for too long.
I was at the cape in July for CRS-9 and this exhibit was probably my favorite thing at KSC. Maybe even better than touring Firing Room 4 in the launch control center.
The Challenger debris sits next to another display containing [Space Shuttle Colombia's window frames.](http://www.collectspace.com/images/news-062715a-lg.jpg)

The atmosphere inside the exhibit is incredibly revenant and respectful. I'm amazed how quiet it was in there considering the hundreds of people browsing the Atlantis attraction in the same building.

I clearly remember the windows on my house shaking as Colombia broke up over Texas.

  

 
With respect to Mr. Hawking, I doubt that an intelligent species that has existed for at least 200,000 years, to say nothing of the earlier human ancestors, would wipe itself out in just over 1000 years after that species' unprecedented explosion of scientific and technology.

Humanity is just beginning to realize it's potential.  
I do not doubt the fact that Mr Hawking is the most intelligent person on earth, however, I think he is part of the establishment and helps install fear, his theory here IS just speculation after all.
That is not at all what that video did. 

When is their first ship going to be built, when are they doing test launches, what is the timeline for getting to Mars? This is just an ad for Boeing, not even Boeing spacecraft just Boeing.
Earth has life, without the living trees, plants, and other flora of earth the entire planet would be different shades of brown like Jupiter or mars
In addition to life creating color, we also have a water cycle, with 3 different phases commonly present. Liquid water is a major erosive force. Water vapor forms clouds and the patterns of its movement create rain. Ice covers the polar regions, and snow covers the more temperate reasons during winter.

Mars also has polar caps, though mostly composed of dry ice.
It also has to do with the fact that we are perfectly far enough from the sun to not be too hot, and close enough to not be a frozen tundra. 

The "Goldilocks Zone" it's called. 
>Why is there no diverse land types or terrains?

Outside of flora and limestone, most of Earth's terrain is duplicated on other planets to some degree. Mars has volcanism and used to have flowing rivers; it has ice caps. Titan has lakes, if not seas.
I don't know who or why, but the how is pretty clear. What makes Earth unique is [its Moon](http://www.astronomytoday.com/astronomy/earthmoon.html).
I always thought [the earlier false color images of it rotating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVScPy-fiGM) looked way cooler than the black and white ones NASA has been releasing lately.
you misunderstand the Moon.

Its tidelocked to the Earth, not the Sun.  Every point in the moon (except a small area near the poles) gets a 2 week day followed by a 2 week night.  We (erroneously) call the side of the moon away from the Earth that we never see "the Dark Side" but thats wrong. Its just the unseen (mostly) side.  Every point gets very hot when in sun and very cold when in darkness but that doesnt change the Moon's shape because the same effect occurs everywhere (again, except for a few permanently shadowed areas near the poles, which appear to contain ice).


No you didn't https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/367q1b/saw_this_on_my_walk_today/
Yes, as a matter of fact it would work surprisingly well on Saturn. Jupiter's gravity is too strong, and Uranus or Neptune's winds would kill your ship. An airship is also great on Venus!
Landing and launching rockets from airships would be difficult, but at its core the concept is workable. Extraterrestrial balloons have already been used on Venus during the VeGa missions.
It would be possible to have an airship or a balloon floating around on 1 of the gas giants, but it's very unlikely that it would be self-sustaining, as there's very few resources that can be extracted from the air.
OK so you need cahoncp. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. You got those you got 99% of the human body, you got plastics and you got ceramics.

You need copper, iron, silicon and with the others you got for food you have most of industrial civilization.

You need heat, pressure, gravity.

For energy you need natural occurring chemicals, solar, nuclear.

Find this stuff and you got yourself a colony. Energy would be the hardest I am betting in a gas giant. Heat exchangers would be unweidly, solar maybe blocked, doubt there is a chemical reaction you can exploit, and finding uranium in a cloud would be a challenge.

Build a platform out of plastics, hover it via ballons, set it at a height to give earth normal gravity, put out a lot of street lights to deal with the darkness, find an energy reaction to use, and congratulations the sky is now the limit and it is a very big sky.
With our current technology the answer is no, in 10 or 20 years on some.... you probably can't have an airship on Saturn as the wind speeds are to fast it would shred any ship. There are diamonds flying around in the atmosphere on Saturn that would rip through ships.

Neptune and Jupiter, possibly. The method would be difficult though.  The easiest type of airship would be suspended using balloons however, there isn't anything you could fill those balloons to create lift as the atmosphere of both planets is filled with helium and hydrogen.

You would need an airship being lifted either with some form of technology we don't have, or by fans (like a drone). You would need some massive power supply though.  Maybe nuclear fusion? 

Great thing about using nuclear fusion on those planets are that you can just scoop up the atmosphere for fuel. 

Honestly, now you have to deal with other things such as the incredibly strong magnetic field. I'm sure those magnetic fields would mess with your electronics.
Given the different extreme environments that we have on Earth that still harbor life, it seems likely that life could take hold on other planets.
My question has always been, what do we know about how life forms? Say there are silicon based lifeforms who breathe in methane and exhale nitrogen instead of carbon based oxygen breathing  or something along those lines.

It isn't, space is about 3 degrees kelvin.  What planet do you know of that is colder than that?
Because in space there's no medium for a heat transfer.  Things like gases and liquids provide a means for heat to be conducted away from something.
A human born and raised on Mars would probably be taller and weaker than one on Earth, but those are not different breeds; those are just growing up in different environments. This is akin to someone growing up indoors as opposed to running around in fields all day; one will have darker skin than the other.

In order for mutations to set in in such a way that a noticeably different *breed* has arisen, it would take many generations. And even then, there would only be minor trends, which themselves could be diffused due to the pressure of sexual selection over natural selection (space-faring people may prefer to breed short and strong, given the more physical nature of space-work and the material needed for exosuits or pods). In other words, it would take a long time for real changes to the genotype of the subset to substantially change. Long enough, in fact, that other factors would arise to muddle it up, such as a regular influx of new colonists from Earth or technological advances that reduce the severity of the changes (such as wearing 90 pounds of clothing on Mars at all times).
I have long thought that the great leap for human evolution won't happen on Earth.  Let's look a thousand years into a future where we don't get FTL, but pressures have led to humanity spreading beyond the solar system. We're twenty light years out, self-sufficient (by necessity) but struggling in these new homes.  Perfect replacement Earths are hard to find.

We adapt technologically, but we also adapt physically.  Differences in gravity, radiation, temperature, and atmosphere mean these populations face new pressures.  There's a minimum multi-year lag in communications.  Interstellar travel is by grimmest necessity, never by whim.  The genetic flow between worlds is nonexistent.  Languages begin to change.

Forward a few thousand years.  Similar pressures (overcrowding, resources, etc.) lead to another push.  Now humanity occupies a volume of a sphere a hundred light years across.  Changes in environments, changes in cultures, changes in habits and customs, along with continuing mutation pressure mean that humanity is beginning to fragment into different species.  Interbreeding between humanity's branches might still be possible, but the magnitude of difficulty required for this to happen means it is essentially eliminated from possibility.

Some civilizations have collapsed along the way and reverted to primitive subsistence.  Digital records revert to writing, and even to oral traditions.   Mythology replaces history.  These civilizations spin down their own paths, disconnected entirely from what we think it means to be human.

Fast forward another ten thousand years.  The children of humanity inhabit every habitable world orbiting every star visible in Earth's night sky.  For every civilization that has successfully spread to nearby stars, one has died out, and two have fallen back into primitive societal structures with rudimentary technology.

Seventy thousand years from now, AI's on one of the original colony worlds invent a means of tricking space-time. The most distant stars are now only weeks away.  The civilization takes it upon themselves to rediscover humanity.  What do they find?

They find unintelligible languages with no common root words, spoken by bipeds (and a few quadrupeds).  They find every imaginable color of skin and hair.  They find children of humanity, settled on a tidally-locked world around a red dwarf who see in infrared.  They find subterranean children, driven underground by occasional lethal stellar flares from an otherwise ordinary star, who see with pulses of ultrasound.  They find children whose females go into oestrus every few months.  They find children that have lost the ability to form logical trains of thought, bipeds more similar in capabilities to macaques than humans.

They find cultures that communicate with rich signed languages.  They find cultures that communicate using whistles.

They find empty ruins.  They find thriving cities.  They find space-faring civilizations.  They find civilizations that have no technology beyond smithing metal.  They find every kind of religion and flavor of non-belief.

They find civilizations that have merged with machines, and civilizations that have been usurped by them.

Humanity and our offspring now have spread to one third of the galaxy.  Populations separated by more than a few thousand years can only produce sterile offspring.  Most populations separated by more than ten thousand years, as a general rule, can no longer interbreed.

We meet the aliens.  They are us, in ways that stretch our imagination.

Although I believe we'll eventually find it, we don't even need to add independently evolved sentient alien life for this scenario.  It actually looks very much like Star Trek.

**EDIT**: words, mobile editing, and Bill Shatner punctuation.

**TL; DR**: I believe that radical speciation will be a function of moving outside the solar system, separated by distances and travel times that prohibit genetic intermingling.
Entirely possible. Surprisingly enough it wouldn't even take that long. Even just the first generation would see some differences in bone structure and the like during their growth.

Problem becomes though, if they go to Earth. They may not have the muscle or bone strength to support their own weight in the higher gravity . Or at the least, be more prone to injuries.

You're overlooking the possibility of designer babies become the norm which may lead to different 'breeds' of people based on different people's view of the ideal human being created right here on earth.
Currently we don't have the same selection pressure as other species have. You don't have to run fast to escape from predators because we killed nearly all predators that could hunt us, and you don't have to run fast to hunt other animals because food in a supermarket doesn't run away.

People would grow differently on different planets even in the first generation, but this is not a genetic change. I don't see why taller humans would get more children on Mars. If not many people move from one planet to the other, you would get random genetic drift over time, over tens of thousands of years this can lead to notable differences.

Artificial ways to alter the genetic code can screw all those considerations, of course, and produce whatever the technology allows.
Seems plausible, although it would probably take quite a few generations for this to happen (noticeably)
If someone grows up on mars their bones may be too weak for them to ever walk on earth. We have no research on how humans development works in space so we can only guess what will happen. 
That's not it. Wealth will create different breeds (due to gene modification and implants.)
Yes, but that's only if human reproduction works without creating eldritch abominations in low gravity. 
You might want to read Stephen Baxter's 'Destiny's Children' series of books. 
Doesn't it take something like a minimum of 10 generations for even a bred-for-trait to become dominent? At least in things like dogs or cattle? Somebody in the animal sciences please throw out the numbers. Humans would have to pretty much follow the same timelines as that, wouldn't they?
The RL-10 is an insane engine. It's been used for over fifty years and is still one of the highest performing liquid hydrogen upper sage engines. It will be very cool of it ends up being used on the EUS sending people back around the moon,  at long last.

That being said, it is hideously expensive, I hope that when ULA replaces it on the ACES upper stage we usher in a new age of upper stage engines. I doubt the MB-60 I'd up to the task so it will probably be a BE-3 or Xcor engine. I can't wait to see the specs for both
I just can't get over the heat and power inside the engine but icicles on the end of the bell.
If you touched the exterior of the bell would you be burnt or frozen?
I would say it mostly has to do with your imagination, but there was certainly less light pollution, the stars themselves wouldn't have faded that quickly though. 
There aren't any significant changes in them.  It was just some artistic licence with patterns they could see in the sky.
Constellations are artificial patterns, resulting from something called pareidolea, the human behavior of seeing patterns that aren't there. Every civilization that looked into the night sky saw their own constellations. The ancient Chinese constellations are totally different although the grouping of larger, brighter stars makes some of the star grouping stick figure outline similar, with a different story.  
  
[Ancient Chinese constellations](http://paulabrown.net/astronomy-stars-constellations-23.jpg)  
  
It would take a lot of research to collect all the constellation patterns from every society that developed them, then overlay them on our modern Greek-derived constellations to see how close the star groupings match up. Humans haven't been around to see much star pattern variation, a nearby super nova here and there, relative positional change due to precession in the Earth's rotation axis.
Worth watching ... A reminder of what we have been missing for the last 44 years...
Thanks for the share! I was involved in creating this film. I'm happy to answer any questions.
Last ever since we know that the manned mission to Mars will be cancelled as well as anything scheduled for the moon.


Very fine mission. ...film does'nt need the cliche'd music. The voices and the silent space gets masked.
Check out that lady's hair at [3:33](https://youtu.be/pa0ci5d2oGY?t=3m33s). That's pretty much exactly what we see from the ISS videos, sans the shaking of the aircraft in this video. It's funny, because to people who think NASA is the ultimate bad guy in terms of a multiple of conspiracies, the hair standing up like that is one of the evidences they use to say that the ISS is fake. When gravity takes a hold again, her hair falls down, just like we'd expect. 

This is another blow (if it's really needed) for the conspiratards.
Raging engineering boner at those sexy RD-180 exhaust plumes. They're absolutely fantastic engines and were ahead of what American rocket propulsion had to offer (still are in some respects). It's a shame that the RD-180 is so politically tainted.

On the other hand, it'll be really cool watching the US's new methalox rockets take flight, with [bluish exhaust plumes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7kqFt3nID4) and [clearer shock diamonds.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbtvFIEBJdA)
For those who are interested [Scott Manley has an interesting video on how and why Atlas V flies with odd numbers of unevenly-spaced SRBs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-o6BLBzsUA).

Wish you'd credit the photographer (Jared Haworth, /u/jardeon) instead of just shamelessly reposting his (awesome) work. Check out @WeReportSpace for more awesome rocket photos from him and his colleagues. 
As the original photographer who shot this image, I wanted to drop in and provide a few details.  I'm a photographer / photo editor for [We Report Space](http://wereportspace.com), a credentialed news agency made up of former NASA Social alumni covering American spaceflight.

This is a photo of the Atlas V 421 rocket lifting [NROL-61 to orbit](http://i.imgur.com/MOnHusg.jpg) on July 28, 2016 from Space Launch Complex 41, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.

I've taken a number of engine closeup photos, but this was the first time I'd successfully exposed for the detail in the SRB plume.  The photo was shot using a Canon 40D and an 85mm f/1.8 short telephoto prime lens, somewhere between 400-500 feet from the rocket.  Exposure was ISO 100, f/11 at 1/4000.  No filters were used (fortunately, the lens's front glass didn't suffer any ill effects from the SRB exhaust at this launch, but I did have to [replace it](https://www.instagram.com/p/BKKFlobgqdh/) after [OSIRIS-REx](http://i.imgur.com/Eoj46A1.jpg)).

The launch was just after sunrise in late July, so some of the light hitting the rocket is from the sun illuminating the side facing the camera, but the bulk of the light in this photo is from the engines themselves.  

If you're interested in seeing more pictures like this, check out our Instagram account @WeReportSpace or our Facebook page.  Earlier this year we published a book, also called **We Report Space** of launch photos and personal anecdotes from NASA Social alumni, covering the period from March 2014 - December 2015, including the first launch of [NASA's Orion capsule on the EFT-1 mission](http://i.imgur.com/14sPLqQ.jpg) and SpaceX's Orbcomm OG2-M2 return to flight and first [return to launch site landing](http://i.imgur.com/bFIt6VV.jpg) at LZ-1.  You can find out more about our book from our website linked above (or contact me for more information).
Beautiful picture but I have a question,  the SRB exhaust is expanding out of the nozzle doesn't this mean the nozzle has the wrong expansion angle/bad flow separation? And since atmospheric pressure will be dropping as it gets up this expansion will be getting bigger. Shouldn't they be starting compressed like the main engines to achieve 0 expansion at some optimal altitude? 
"Rocket engines burning fuel so fast, up into the night sky they blast"
The fire from the rocket looks like a liquid. It's sort of beautiful.
Is that conduit looking line along the side of the SRB is the FTS system? 
That's just pure unadulterated hatred for gravity flowing out the ass end of that rocket.
There will be an Atlas V launch this Saturday (Nov 19th) if anyone is interested  

https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES-R-Launch
I know they don't design rockets to look pretty, but damn, Atlas V, especially the 54X configs, sure look like they did. 
How does all the thrust from these engines get transferred to the shuttle it's self?

I remember watching a short vid on this which is on youtube explaining just how fucking powerful this thing was. Shit like this gives me goosebumps like no other.
Did some of the insulation on the main tank come off? That looks interesting.
Here's a source: http://wereportspace.com/

I think it's like a dad and his daughter taking all these photos..
Soyuz 5 will also use methane engine. And Russia did have several old methane engine, On top of some early proposal to have methane engine several years ago, before finally decide to go ahead with entire new rocket.

Soyuz 5/Fenix first flight target is 2022.

NGLS first flight will earlier, but very close to Soyuz 5.  Both will be first gen large methane engine rocket.

Q: Which parts of the Atlas V are reusable?

A: wut? It works. That's enough. Forever. Now give me more tax money so I can buy a one-use rocket for 300MM
[Space Shuttle Challenger](http://greenplanetethics.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/story-28-1a-5challenger-68168.jpg) at liftoff.
Too bad we haven't found a better way to get off planet. Like using an anti gravity drive or something. I mean come on, were living the future
the titan will be even better. (they shouldn't have canceled navajo)
It's kind of surreal to see our atmosphere from this angle. It's a haunting reminder of how small it really is in comparison to the vastness of the planet, and how easy it is to screw things up.
/r/telescopes

Read the stickied post there. It's really not worth buying something in the $100 range, really if you want to get a telescope worth buying you will need to spend roughly $200. The AWB OneSky telescope is probably the best choice for all-around noob use at that price range, but you may be able to find a much better scope used.

Seriously though, head over to that sub. 
I dont have too much experience with different telescopes but an 5-6in reflector should be in your budget, I have an 8in and it's great for amateur astronomy. 
Just don't go cheap. I did and regretted it so much it was terrible. I think I spent less than £70.
Looks more like stratus.  Or dust, particularly in the extreme lower left of the image.
It'd be pretty comparable, you have to be really close to an incredibly strong gravitational field before any significant changes are noticed. 

Lazy to do the maths now but it would be under 1s difference per earth year. 

What would be much more noticeable for any future humans there is the difference in day/year length more than anything else.
