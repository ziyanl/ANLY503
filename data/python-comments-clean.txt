LYRICS ARE IMPRESSIVE BUT THAT SPEECH SYNTHESIS IS STRAIGHT OUT OF

GREAT NEWS THE BEST OPENSOURCE ERP
APPLICATION PLATFORM NICE GPL NO THANKS
PACKAGE AND DISTRIBUTE MY ALTERED VERSION OF THE PROJECT TO MY OTHER PACKAGES

IT'S BEST IF YOU CAN AVOID HAVING A FORK OF COBRAPY BUT RATHER YOUR OWN PACKAGE THAT COBRAPY CLASSES AND ADDS CHANGES FUNCTIONALITY TO THOSE THAT WAY YOU WON'T HAVE TO ADJUST YOUR FORK EVERY TIME THE UPSTREAM CHANGES YOU ALSO DON'T CAUSE FOR THE COBRAPY PROJECT IN CASE YOUR FORK WOULD BECOME VERY POPULAR WITH YOUR NEW PACKAGE CONSIDER MAKING IT A PROPER PYTHON PACKAGE IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY AND LET CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION SERVICE LIKE TRAVIS BUILD TEST AND DISTRIBUTE THE PACKAGE FOR YOU ASSUMING YOUR PACKAGE IS PURE PYTHON THIS IS REALLY QUITE JUST INCLUDE A FILE AND TURN ON AUTOMATIC BUILDS ON PUSH

PACKAGE MY EXTENSION WHICH DEPENDS ON MY ALTERED PROJECT TO MY FLASK PROJECT

DO THE SAME AS FOR YOUR OTHER PACKAGE AND ADJUST YOUR TO MAKE PYTHON INCLUDE THE DEPENDENCY ON INSTALL

UPON UPDATING SOMETHING IN THE EXTENSION OR PROJECT CODE BE ABLE TO MY PROJECTS WHICH DEPEND ON THEM DOESN'T HAVE TO BE JUST SENSIBLE

TRAVIS WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS FOR YOU FOR THE YOU MAY CONSIDER BUNDLING IT AS A DOCKER IMAGE HOSTED ON DOCKER CLOUD TRAVIS CAN THEN ALSO TAKE CARE OF UPDATING THAT IMAGE AND IT IF YOU WANT

AND IF YOU WANT YOU ARE OF COURSE WELCOME TO SUBMIT SUGGESTED CHANGES TO COBRAPY WE MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU WANT

ON THE VIRTUALENVS I USE ONE FOR EACH SETUP I INTEND TO SUPPORT SO ONE FOR EACH OF AND BUT USE THE SAME FOR DIFFERENT PACKAGES YOU MAY CONSIDER LOOKING INTO USING TOX FOR TESTING


JUST GETTING MY ASS INTO PYTHON MYSELF SO TAKE WHAT I SAY WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BUT WHAT I'D SAY IS IF YOU'RE PROVIDING YOUR OWN PACKAGE ID LOOK INTO WHAT IT TAKES TO GET IT ON PEPI THAT WOULD SOLVE SERVING THE PACKAGE TO THE MASSES SINCE THAT MAKES IT EASY TO JUST PIP INSTALL IT FOR VIRTUALENV I'D SAY KEEPING SEPARATE ENVIRONMENTS FOR BOTH WOULD BE GOOD EVEN THOUGH AT FIRST IT MAY SEEM UNNEEDED YOU MIGHT HAVE EXTRA DEPENDENCIES IN YOUR FLASK PROJECT THAT ARE EXTRANEOUS FOR YOUR PACKAGE SO KEEPING THEM SEPARATE WOULD HELP AVOID WEIRD DEPENDENCIES
PACKAGE AND DISTRIBUTE MY ALTERED VERSION OF COBRAPY TO MY OTHER PACKAGES

I ASSUME YOU HAVE A MODIFIED CLONE OF COBRAPY IN THAT DIRECTORY RUN PIP INSTALL EAST THIS INSTALLS COBRAPY AS A SNEAKY REFERENCE TO THE CURRENT DIRECTORY EVERYTHING WORKS AS NORMAL BUT YOUR CHANGES ARE INSTANTLY SEEN BY ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IMPORTS COBRAPY AND ANY COMMANDLINE OR OTHER TOOLS

IF YOU MEAN DISTRIBUTE TO OTHER USERS YOU SHOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY GET YOUR CHANGES MERGED UPSTREAM INSTEAD CAN YOU WORK WITH THE MAINTAINERS TO MAKE THIS FASTER CAN YOU WORK AROUND THEM TO USE THE CURRENT VERSION WITH REDUCED FUNCTIONALITY

PACKAGE MY EXTENSION WHICH DEPENDS ON MY ALTERED COBRAPY TO MY FLASK PROJECT

THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS AN OPTIONAL EXTENSION IN SO YOU END UP WITH PIP INSTALL MYMODULE TO INSTALL THE WHOLE THING SEE HERE AND HERE FOR DETAILS

SO I WOULD WAIT FOR THE CHANGES TO COBRAPY THEN PIP INSTALL YOUREXTENSION AND RUN THE FLASK SERVER

UPON UPDATING SOMETHING IN THE EXTENSION OR PROJECT CODE BE ABLE TO MY PROJECTS WHICH DEPEND ON THEM DOESN'T HAVE TO BE JUST SENSIBLE

I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN HERE PIP INSTALL EAST MIGHT HELP THOUGH YOU MIGHT NEED TO DO IT WITH EACH VIRTUALENV ACTIVE I TEND TO USE ONE ENVIRONMENT FOR SEVERAL PROJECTS IF THEY HAVE COMMON DEPENDENCIES PRECISELY TO MINIMISE THIS KIND OF BOOKKEEPING
YOU COULD CONSIDER MONKEY PATCHING WITH THE MOCK PACKAGE IN ORDER TO MAKE YOUR MODIFICATIONS THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO FORK COBRAPY AND YOUR MODIFICATION CAN BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYTHING YOU NEED IT TO BE

COME TO THINK OF IT I ENDED UP PATCHING BIOPYTHON FOR A SIMILAR REASON AND IT'S GOING TO BE A WHILE BEFORE THE NEXT VERSION HITS PEPI THIS MIGHT NOT BE A BAD SOLUTION FOR THAT
R LEARNPYTHON
INTERESTING FRAMEWORK LOOKS VERY USEFUL IN THE PAST I DEVELOPED SUCH A FRAMEWORK FOR NET BUT I'LL DEFINITELY TRY IT OUT SINCE I FOCUS MORE ON PYTHON DEVELOPMENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE THESE DAYS
TEACHING BEGINNERS THAT BYTES AND STRINGS ARE THE SAME IS AN INVALID COGNITIVE SHORTCUT AND JUST OUTRIGHT BAD EDUCATION
OF PROGRAMMERS DON T NEED TO THINK ABOUT UNICODE

UNTIL THEY RUN THEIR SCRIPT APP PROJECT IN THE REAL WORLD AND HIT UNICODEDECODEERROR

PROBABLY SHOULD BE OF PROGRAMMERS DON'T THINK ABOUT UNICODE BUT PROBABLY SHOULD
I WORK FOR ONE OF THOSE ENTERPRISE SHOPS AND BECAUSE IT WAS MY CALL TO MAKE I PUT IN A PLAN FOR MIGRATION I'M STILL DEBUGGING SHIT MONTHS LATER AND EVERYTHING LEFT IS ALL TIED TO THE STRING UNICODE BYTES STRING CONVERSION IN DEFENSE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF IT IS FAULT THIS WHOLE ALL UPLOADS ARE BYTES FUCK YOU THING IS A SOURCE OF ENDLESS PAIN WHEN DEALING WITH LIBRARIES LIKE CONFIGPARSER THAT EXPECT FILES AS INPUT STILL THERE COMES A POINT WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT THE PAIN IS ALSO A RESULT OF PYTHON ABANDONING PYTHON 2 S TYPING PRINCIPLES METHODS LIKE STARTSWITH REALLY SHOULD BE AGNOSTIC TO BYTE STRING PARAMETERS THEY BOTH QUACK THEY'RE BOTH DUCKS
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SHAWS IDEA OF EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD WORK TO RUN IN IF I CONCAN A BYTES AND STR IN PYTHON 2 CODE IN A PYTHON VM WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN

DO THEY WORK IF THE FILE IS PYTHON 2 BUT FAIL IF THE FILE IS PYTHON AND IF SO HOW THE HELL DO YOU TELL
A LESS ENTERTAINING BUT PROBABLY MORE SOLID REBUTTAL THAN HOWEVER MUCH I ENJOYED THAT
REBUTTING ARTICLE PROMISES TO BECOME AN ENDURING PYTHONISSA PASTIME
A CODING LANGUAGE ONLY IMPROVES WHEN IT IS USED

IN THIS LIGHT THE PYTHON ECOSYSTEM AND COMMUNITY IS BEING ACTIVELY AND DELIBERATELY HARMED BY THOSE WHO PROMOTE CONTINUED ADHERENCE TO PYTHON 2 AND ADVOCATE AGAINST USING PYTHON
I'VE BEEN LURKING RECENTLY BECAUSE I'M JUST STARTING TO LEARN I WANT TO USE PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION MAYBE MODELLING AND SIMULATION DOES THIS AFFECT ME SHOULD I WORRY ABOUT LEARNING
IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE SOME CIVILITY FINALLY AND THE AUTHOR ACTUALLY ADDRESSED THE POINTS IN ARTICLE WHILE AVOIDING JUMPING ON THE WHOLE THING

ONE THING THOUGH I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN ADDRESSED IS WHETHER PYTHON 2 OR PYTHON IS BETTER FOR BEGINNERS WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHERE ZED SHAW WAS COMING FROM

ALSO SURE IT'S DIFFICULT TO RECOMMEND AN AOL LANGUAGE BUT TO A BEGINNER WHO JUST GOT THEIR FIRST PROGRAMMING JOB WHERE PYTHON 2 IS THE LANGUAGE USED IN THE COMPANY TELLING THE BEGINNER YOU SHOULDN'T USE PYTHON 2 BECAUSE X Y AND Z ISN'T HELPFUL AND DOESN'T SERVE THE BEGINNER WHO PROBABLY DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE AND THERE IS HEAPS OF LEGACY PYTHON 2 CODE BELIEVE IT OR NOT AS WELL AS COMPANIES THAT USE THEM I'M IN ONE
OF PROGRAMMERS DON'T NEED TO THINK ABOUT UNICODE

FAFFY

I TRY NEVER TO CARE ABOUT UNICODE MOST THINGS I DO WITH PYTHON ARE LITTLE TOOLS TO EASE SOME PRIVATE TASK OF MY OWN AND YET UNICODE HAS BITTEN ME MORE TIMES THAN I CAN REMEMBER IF IT HAD JUST BEEN IN PYTHON FROM THE BEGINNING A LOT OF THOSE BITES WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED SO NOW EVEN THOUGH I DON'T CARE ABOUT UNICODE I CARE ABOUT UNICODE

INCIDENTALLY THE BIGGEST NIGHTMARE I HAVE IS WITH OWN STRUCT MODULE WHICH ITSELF DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BYTES AND STRINGS BUT PERHAPS IT'S ME OR PERHAPS I'M USING SOME OLDER VERSION OF PYTHON
PROMISING TO KEEP AS A STABLE TARGET MAKES IT HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE CODING COSTS ARE MOSTLY MAINTENANCE IF YOU WENT TO PYTHON YOU GET TO RECOMPILE YOUR EXTENSIONS EVERY YEAR AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP DOING IT AS EACH N IS DECLARED DEAD SIX YEAR OLD CYD SO EXTENSIONS FOR STILL WORK NOW
THE KILLER FEATURE OF IS LONG TERM BINARY COMPATIBILITY
CROSSPOSTING MY COMMENT IN THE SITE

THE PYTHON 2 PYTHON TRANSITION WAS MADE IN A TERRIBLE WAY IT ALMOST KILLED THE LANGUAGE

THE ONLY CHANGE THAT MADE IT BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE WAS TO MAKE STRINGS UNICODE BY DEFAULT THEY SHOULD HAVE ADDED A TRANSITIONAL STRING SOMETHING LIKE STRBYTES AND THEN WOULD JUST ADD PARENTHESIS FOR PRINT FOR AND MAKE EVERY STRING STRBYTES

ANYHOW I THINK PYTHON IS A BETTER LANGUAGE IT IS WHERE ALL PYTHON PROGRESS HAPPENED IN THE LAST DECADE AFTER ALL AND IT S FINALLY FLOURISHING BY CEBIAN AND RED HAT WILL SHIP PYTHON BY DEFAULT FACEBOOK ALREADY USES PYTHON BY DEFAULT GOOGLE IS TRANSITIONING TO PYTHON WEB IS FINALLY BEING PORTED TO PYTHON IN THE END EVERYONE WILL BE ON PYTHON AND BY EVERYONE I MEAN OF ACTIVE PYTHON DEVS

ABOUT FORMATTING STRINGS I DO NOT THINK THERE IS TOO MANY WAYS OF DOING IT

THE NEW WAY SHOULD BE THE DEFAULT AND IT S JUST A SHORTCUT FOR FORMAT SOMETIMES YOU CANNOT USE F STRINGS MAYBE YOU WANT TO USE A PREPARED STRING THAT CODIFIES THE FORMAT AND THEN YOU SHOULD USE THE UNSUGARED FORMAT THE PERCENT WAY SHOULD BE USED WHEN YOU WANT TO TREAT BYTES AND STRINGS MORE OR LESS EQUALLY IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR THE STRBYTE COMPATIBILITY STRING BUT ALAS THAT DOES NOT EXIST



MY CASE AGAINST PYTHON IS THAT HEL CENTOS ISN'T USING IT BY DEFAULT YET
MOST NERDS ARE VERY TOLERANT AND ACCEPTING BUT SEE SOMEONE OUTSPOKEN WITH A STRONG OPINION AND THEY MIGHT THINK HEY BE TOLERANT LIKE I AM LOUDMOUTH

SO I CAN SEE WHY HE DRAWS A LITTLE FIRE

THAT SAID I THINK ZED SHAW HAS A COUPLE GOOD POINTS

PYTHON IS WONDERFUL BUT PYTHON IS CHAOTIC

THERE IS LOTS OF WONDERFUL STUFF WRITTEN IN PYTHON BUT A LOT OF IT BREAKS ON PYTHON EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

I AM REMINDED OF AN OLD JOEL ON SOFTWARE ARTICLE THAT IS FULL OF OPINION BUT ALSO FULL OF WISDOM

BASICALLY HE SAYS THROWING STUFF OUT AND STARTING OVER IS BAD

AND I THINK THE PYTHON 2 BROKE THIS RULE

I DON'T LIKE THIS I'M NOT GOING TO RUN IT

WHO SAID THAT BOTH ZED SHAW AND PYTHON
I WISH THERE WAS MORE OF A CASE FOR PYTHON
WHY DOES EVERYONE ONLY THINK ABOUT STRINGS AND THE FEW APPLICATIONS PYTHON IS ALREADY IN

THE WHOLE DIVIDE IS AN INTEGER PART OF PYTHON 2 IS A COMPLETE FOR ANY SCIENTIFIC WORK
ANYONE HERE AVAILABLE TO BE A CODE MENTOR
NOT MAKING AND COMPATIBLE WAS NOT AN AMAZING DECISION WE PYTHON PROGRAMMERS LOST DUE TO THIS WE COULD ALL BE USING NEW VERSION OF THE LANGUAGE WE SO LOVED INSTEAD OF DREADING TO MAKE THAT SWITCH THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT PYTHON DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH FEATURES TO MAKE US WANT TO SWITCH I USE A LOT OF UNICODE I WAS HOPING PYTHON WOULD HAVE AS MUCH SUPPORT AS JAVA WHENEVER I NEED TO HANDLE UNICODE I JUST USE JAVA NOT WORTH THE HASSLE
IF ONLY PYTHON WOULD SUPPORT SOMETHING LINE VERSION AND THEN MAKE PYTHON INSTALL THE VERSION NEEDED AUTOMATICALLY
HE FORGOT TO MENTION THAT NOT ALL NEW PROGRAMMERS ARE TAUGHT IN ENGLISH SO HIS IS MEANINGLESS ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TAUGHT IN LANGUAGES THAT USE UNICODE AND IT IS A PAIN IN THE ADS TO WORK WITH UNICODE IT IS THAT AND THE AMOUNT OF LIBRARIES AVAILABLE THAT MAKE PYTHON 2 THE BEST CHOICE FOR BEGINNERS BTW MY FIRST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WAS PYTHON

R LEARNPYTHON IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO POST SUCH QUESTIONS PLEASE READ THE SIDEBAR AND CONSIDER POSTING SOME CODE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN HELP YOU OUT
BELONGS ON R DURANGO ALTHOUGH IT IS HARDLY NEWS ANYMORE
I'D SAY THE NUMBER ONE SKILL IS THE ABILITY TO WRITE BLOG POSTS OR GENERATE OTHER CONTENT SPAM TRYING TO CAPITALISE ON THE EVERYTHING IS DATA SCIENCE FAD
STOP SCAMMING REDDIN

ANY NAME FOR D IN DATA DEPARTUREBOARD DEPARTURE VALUES

REMOVE VALUES IF IT WAS ACTUALLY A LIST INSTEAD OF A DICTIONARY


A LIST WILL USE ALL THE MEMORY IT REQUIRES A GENERATOR WILL USE ONLY THE MEMORY NECESSARY FOR ONE ELEMENT WELL MORE OR LESS BUT BASICALLY THIS

SURE IF YOU'RE DEALING WITH OR SO ELEMENTS THAT DIFFERENCE DOESN'T MAKE MUCH ARM DIFFERENCE BUT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH ELEMENTS OR EVEN MORE THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE NOT TO MENTION MOST ALGORITHMS WOULD REQUIRE CREATING THE LIST OF ELEMENTS AND THE PROCESS IT INSTEAD OF BUILD ONE PROCESS ONE REPEAT
R LEARNPYTHON
THERE IS A RULE OF THUMB WHEN USING GENERATORS AND THIS IS WHAT OTHER LANGUAGES CALL LAZY EVALUATION WHEN YOU HAVE LARGE SET OF RESULTS WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU WILL NEED ALL OF THEM THIS ALSO MAKES YIELD A GREAT TOOL TO WRITE CALLBACKS OR RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS YIELD IS NOT EASY TO MASTER AND YOU NEED TO STUDY A FEW REAL LIFE SCENARIOS IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND IT

SINCE THIS IS BORDERING ON THE REALM OF LOCALIZATION HAVING SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK WELL WITH GETTEXT WOULD PROBABLY BE A MORE PRACTICAL ANGLE
YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THOSE PLUS SIGNS IN THE LAST STATEMENT A GROUP OF STRINGS SEPARATED BY NEWLINES SURROUNDED BY PARENTHESES WILL BE JOINED IMPLICITLY

HELLO
WORLD
HELLO WORLD
YOU SHOULD SUPPORT PRONOUNS BEFORE YOU OFFEND SOMEONE
UH-HUH THAT KIND OF THING IS GENERALLY NOT ALLOWED IN GAMES IF IT'S A DECENT GAME THEY'LL HAVE METHODS IN PLACE TO PREVENT YOU FROM DOING THIS
YOU'RE MAKING YOUR LIFE A LOT HARDER BY WANTING THE KEYBOARD AND MOUSE CONTROLS TO OPERATE IN THE BACKGROUND I SUPPOSE YOU COULD RUN THE BOT WITH A HEADLESS BROWSER LIKE PHANTOMS

I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A BRIDGE TOO FAR IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER ASSUMING YOU COULD CAPTURE AND PARSE THE GAMESTATE FROM WIRESHARK NOT A GUARANTEE AT A GLANCE THE GAME STILL LOOKS PRETTY COMPLICATED YOU MIGHT WANT TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT SIMILAR PROJECTS PEOPLE HAVE UNDERTAKEN WITH SIMPLER GAMES

THIS IS A PAPER WRITTEN FOR AN UNDERGRADUATE COURSE ASSIGNMENT FROM STANFORD ABOUT USING REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TO PROGRAM A MARIO AI BOT IT'S PROBABLY AS ACCESSIBLE A PAPER AS YOU WILL FIND FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM DOMAIN
PRO

IF YOU SEARCH GOOGLE SCHOLAR FOR MARIO AI COMPETITION YOU'LL FIND LOTS OF OTHER PAPERS THERE USED TO BE A PYTHON CLIENT FOR THE COMPETITION BUT SINCE IT'S LAPSED YOU MIGHT NEED TO GO DUMPSTER DIVING IN GOOGLE TO FIND A COPY

IF THIS IS A BIT MUCH AND IT PROBABLY IS YOU SHOULD START WITH A SIMPLE GAME LIKE PONG AND WORK YOUR WAY UP
AT THAT POINT YOU MIGHT AS WELL FIRST TRY RECOMPILING AND REVERSE ENGINEERING THE JAR FILE UNLESS IT'S VERY BASIC COMMUNICATIONS IN A NON CUSTOM MESSAGE TYPE IT WILL GET DIFFICULT FAST
CAN YOU TELL US THE SPECIFIC PACKAGES YOU'RE TRYING TO INSTALL AND THEIR VERSIONS
SWITCH TO CONDA NOW AND NEVER LOOK BACK
I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW THIS SHOULD BE PRESENTED AS A COMPARISON THEY ARE JUST SIMPLY 2 DIFFERENT TOOLS NOT MUCH IN COMMON
THIS IS COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES YOU MAY AS WELL COMPARE DURANGO TO JINJA 2

IS A LIBRARY FOR PARSING HEML XML IT HAS MINIMAL LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THAT YOU GIVE IT HEML IT GIVES YOU THE STUFF OUT IT'S SIMILAR TO THE SCRAPY PARCEL LIBRARY

SCRAPY IS AN ENTIRE FRAMEWORK FOR CRAWLING AND PARSING WEBSITES UNLIKE IT WILL HANDLE AUTHENTICATION CONCURRENCY HEADERS REDIRECTS RETRIES SITE FILTERING NO DUPLICATES REQUESTS NO UNWANTED SITES DOMAINS AND THROTTLING IT'S ALSO EXTENSIBLE WITH EXTENSIONS MIDDLEWARDS AND IMPLEMENTS FUNCTIONALITY TO KEEP LARGE PROJECTS SANE AND ORGANIZED ITEM LOADERS ITEM PIPELINES LOGGING

AS FOR THE ARTICLE ITSELF IT'S FULL OF MISLEADING INFORMATION

SCRAPY HANDLES THE COOKIES FOR YOU OUT OF THE BOX BUT LINKEDIT HAS COOKIES WHICH WILL TELL THE SERVER VALIDATING THE COOKIES THAT SOMETHING IS NOT OK

WITH BEAUTIFULSOUP AND REQUESTS YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THIS BEHAVIOR NATURALLY THIS INVOLVES MORE CODING BUT YOU HAVE EVERYTHING IN THE TIP OF YOUR FINGERS TO TAKE CARE ABOUT ALL THE COOKIES YOU WANT TO SEND

YOU ALSO HAVE THIS FUNCTIONALITY WITH SCRAPY VIA A MIDDLEWARDS WHICH WOULD BE AS EASY OR EASIER TO IMPLEMENT THEN REQUESTS COOKIE JAR MANIPULATION

MOST WEBSITES DO NOT USE TRICKY COOKIES LIKE WE HAVE SEEN PREVIOUSLY BUT COUNT INCOMING REQUESTS FROM IP ADDRESSES IN A GIVEN BECAUSE SCRAPY DOES MULTIPLE REQUESTS AT A TIME YOU CAN EASILY ENCOUNTER THIS PROBLEM

IF THIS HAPPENS TRY TO CHANGE THE PARAMETER AGAIN IN THE TO A BIGGER VALUE THIS MAKES YOUR SCRAPING SLOWER BUT YOU DON'T GET BLOCKED WHICH IN THE END MAKES YOUR SCRAPING FASTER

WITH BEAUTIFULSOUP THERE IS NO SUCH PROBLEM BY DEFAULT BECAUSE SUCH APPLICATIONS RUN IN ONE THREAD AND BLOCK UNTIL THE RESPONSE IS THERE FROM THE SERVER AND THE PARSING IS DONE

THIS ISN'T A FEATURE USING BLOCKING OPERATIONS FOR FETCHING DATA IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR CRAWLING WITH CRAWLING THERE IS A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME YOU'RE WAITING ON RESPONSES TO REQUESTS WITH YOU COULD BE PARSING AND OUTPUTTING DATA QUEUEING UP OTHER REQUESTS THIS WOULD BE BY FAR THE BIGGEST BOTTLENECK OF THE PROJECT

WITH SCRAPY YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER DELAYS AND CONCURRENCY AND THERE'S NO REASON TO SAY THIS IS A DOWNSIDE
IN GENERAL THE ARTICLE IS LIGHT ON CODE EXAMPLES AND REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF MISUNDERSTANDING OF EVEN BASIC FUNCTIONALITY OF BEAUTIFULSOUP THERE ARE ONLY THE MOST BASIC BEAUTIFULSOUP EXAMPLES AND THEY HAVE PROBLEMS AND SEEMINGLY NO SCRAPY EXAMPLES AT ALL

I JUST DON'T GET WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT HERE

JUST THE ONE OR THE OTHER

IF YOU ASK YOURSELF WHICH ONE SHALL I USE I LIKE HOW BEAUTIFULSOUP TREATS PARSING BUT I LOVE THE WAYS SCRAPY LEVERAGES MY WORK WITH LESS CODE IN THIS CASE MY ANSWER IS USE BOTH BECAUSE SCRAPY IS A WEBSITE SCRAPER IT USES CONTENT EXTRACTORS AND BECAUSE BEAUTIFULSOUP IS A CONTENT EXTRACTOR YOU CAN INCLUDE IT IN YOUR PROJECT TO DO THE SCRAPING WITH THIS LIBRARY INSTEAD OF BUILT-IN SOLUTIONS

IMPORT SCRAPY
FROM IMPORT BEAUTIFULSOUP
DEF PARSE SELF RESPONSE
SOUP BEAUTIFULSOUP
TITLE

AS YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN MIX BOTH APPROACHES TOGETHER SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO LEARN A NEW SYNTAX IF YOU JUST WANT TO SWITCH OVER TO SCRAPY


I DON'T SEE HE IMPORTS SCRAPY AND THEN PARSES A TITLE TAG USING BEAUTIFULSOUP ALONE NO SCRAPY INVOLVED ALSO THE PRESENCE OF THE SELF ARGUMENT IS INCORRECT THERE IS NO CLASS DEFINITION THE INDENTATION DOES NOT EVEN IMPLY THE EXISTENCE OF A CLASSICAL

ALSO WHAT IS THIS IN THE SECTION TITLED THROTTLING

WITH BEAUTIFULSOUP THERE IS NO SUCH PROBLEM OF GETTING BLOCKED BY THE SERVER DUE TO CONCURRENT REQUESTS BY DEFAULT BECAUSE SUCH APPLICATIONS RUN IN ONE THREAD AND BLOCK UNTIL THE RESPONSE IS THERE FROM THE SERVER AND THE PARSING IS DONE NATURALLY SOMETIMES THIS CAN CAUSE TROUBLES IF YOU HAVE A FAST INTERNET CONNECTION AND COMPUTER AND YOU CAN GATHER AND PROCESS INFORMATION REALLY FAST AND YOU GET BLOCKED TO AVOID THIS YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE MANUALLY YOU CAN ADD SOME SLEEP INTO YOUR CODE FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN GETTING THE WEBSITE CONTENTS AND EXTRACTING THE INFORMATION

DEF SCRAPE NRL
SOUP BEAUTIFULSOUP URLOPEN NRL
SLEEP
FOR ARTICLE IN SOUP DIV CLASS

IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE WE WAIT SECONDS BEFORE WE EXTRACT THE CONTENTS I KNOW THIS CAN BE SLOW BUT SOMETIMES IT IS FASTER THAN A WORKING FOR MINUTES GETTING BANNED FOR HOURS WORKING FOR MINUTES GETTING BANNED ALMOST ENDLESS LOOP

SO THE SLEEP IS POINTLESS AND DOES NOTHING THE EXTRACTION TAKES PLACE AFTER THE DATA HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED ALREADY YOU GRABBED THE DATA AT WHATEVER RATE YOU COULD ON A SINGLE THREADED PROCESS FROM A SINGLE INTERNET CONNECTION UNLIKELY TO RESULT IN SOME KIND OF SERVER ERROR UNLESS YOU STRUCTURE YOUR REQUEST TO ASK FOR A HUGE NUMBER OF ITEMS AND THE SERVER LIMITS THE RESPONSE TIME OR SOMETHING AND THEN YOU JUST WAIT BEFORE YOU START TO ORGANIZE IT ON YOUR DISK PARSING TAKES PLACE LOCALLY NOT ON THE SERVER

THOSE ARE BY THE WAY THE ONLY TWO CODE EXAMPLES ALSO WHAT IS WITH THE CUT-OFF FOR LOOP AT THE END WHY NOT JUST FINISH THE EXAMPLE

I DON'T MEAN TO BELITTLE THE AUTHOR BUT HE OR SHE SHOULD EXAMINE WHAT IT IS THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND ASK THEMSELVES IF THEY ARE WILLING TO PUT IN THE EFFORT TO REALLY LEARN THE MATERIAL THESE EXAMPLES STRIKE ME AS HAVING BEEN COPIED FROM SOMEWHERE WITHOUT COMPREHENSION
HEY MAN

YOU'LL POSSIBLY WANT TO TO R NETWORKING AS THERE'S MORE OF US WHO USE PYTHON THERE FOR AUTOMATING NETWORK TASKS

HAVING WORKED WITH THE MAJOR VENDOR IN MY STATE WHO USES ALLWORK EVERYWHERE I'M NOT SURE IF THEY CAN EVEN BE TO OR HAVE A VERY WELL-DOCUMENTED API THE FIELD TECHS DOING THE INSTALLS JUST KIND OF WINGED IT TO MAKE IT WORK

I'D LOOK INTO HOW NETMIKO WORKS WITH THE CISCO JUNIPER ETC EQUIPMENT AND GO FROM THERE I KNOW PEOPLE USE EXPECT TOOLSHED TO MAKE THEIR APPLIANCES WORK AND KIRK BYERS PROBABLY USED SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR HIS NETMIKO LIBRARY

PARAMIKO MAY BE GENERIC ENOUGH TO HELP WITH WHAT YOU NEED

BASICALLY I'D APPROACH IT LIKE THIS I DO THIS WITH AMAYA CONFIDES

FIND OUT HOW THE DEVICE STORES THE CONFIGURATION

USE PYTHON TO TAKE INPUTS FROM A DATABASE CSF RAW TEXT AND MAKE A BASELINE OR EVEN COMPLETED CONFIGURATION FILE

TOSS IT UP ON THE PBX REBOOT AND BAM

A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH GAVE ME ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN THE WAY OF TOOLS FOR AUTOMATING OR SYNCHRONIZING ALLWORK DEPLOYMENTS
YOU MIGHT BENEFIT FROM WORKING WITHIN AN EXISTING FRAMEWORK FOR AUTOMATION LIKE ANNIBALE OR SALT THEY ARE BOTH BUILT IN PYTHON AND BOTH THE TOOLS THEMSELVES AND THE COMMUNITIES AROUND THEM HAVE EXPERTISE ABOUT DOING X ON DOZENS OF SERVERS FOR MANY DIFFERENT VALUES OF X LOOK AT HOW THEY HANDLE NETWORK DEVICES SUCH AS SWITCHES ROUTERS OR LOAD BALANCERS AND SEE IF YOU CAN IMITATE THAT

IT MAY SEEM LIKE A BIG COGNITIVE LOAD TO LEARN HOW A BIG PROJECT BUILT ON PYTHON DOES THINGS RATHER THAN JUST BUILDING ON PYTHON YOURSELF BUT THE STABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY YOU STAND TO GAIN ARE WORTH IT IMO
U SISTO

AS THE DOWNVOTE SEEMS TO IMPLY NOT FROM ME THIS ISN'T REALLY THE RIGHT SUBREDDIT FOR THIS KIND OF POST R LEARNPYTHON WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER BET

THAT SAID CONGRATULATIONS ON WRITING YOUR FIRST SCRIPTURE PYTHON IS A GREAT SKILL TO LEARN AFTER LOOKING AT YOUR SCRIPT I HAD A COUPLE OF IDEAS ON HOW TO SIMPLIFY IT AND IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE

ANONYMOUS

ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T USE IT IN THE ABOVE SCRIPT FOR SIMPLICITY YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO REQUESTS INSTEAD OF URLLIB IT'S JUST A NICER WAY OF MAKING HEML REQUESTS


EDIT

JUST TO SHOW AN EXAMPLE OF USING REQUESTS ONLY THE TOP OF THE GIST NEEDS TO BE CHANGED REMOVE IMPORTS OF JASON AND URLLIB AND SLIGHTLY MODIFY

FROM IMPORT
FROM DEATHTIME IMPORT DEATHTIME TIMEDELTA

REQ GET FORMAT ENDPOINT
RETURN

AT FIRST I DIDN'T LIKE THE S HERE

MATCHRESULT S

BUT THEN I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL CAUSE IT KINDA CODES IT MORE

OVERALL GOOD JOB NOT BAD FOR A FIRST PROJECT BUT THEN AGAIN I AM NOT A PYTHON DEV YET
YEAH I COULD HAVE DEFINITELY USED A BETTER NAME FOR THAT STRING TO MAKE MY SCRIPT MORE READABLE THANK YOU FOR THE INPUT
HI I AM STARTING TO LEARN PYTHON AND JUST CAME ACROSS YOUR POST CAN YOU PROVIDE POINTERS TO THE RESOURCES YOU USED TO STUDY PYTHON TIA
ORIGINALLY INSPIRED FROM

YOU WROTE LIKE MEANINGFUL SHORT FUNCTIONS ON TOP OF THE ORIGINAL CODE

UPLOADING SOMEONE'S PRIVATE IMAGES TO A FILE SHARING SITE ONLY TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH ONE OF MANY DEEP LEARNING APIS IS ALSO CONCERNING


EDIT OH IT'S YOU WHO INSPIRED YOU SORRY FOR THE FIRST PARAGRAPH THEN I THOUGHT IT'S SOMEONE ELSE
THIS REALLY BELONGS ON R LEARNPYTHON

THE USUAL WAY FOR DOING THIS IS TO WRITE AN INFINITE LOOP THAT YOU BREAK OUT OF WHEN AN ACCEPTABLE VALUE IS FOUND SUCH AS

WHILE TRUE
TEMP FLOAT ENTER A VALUE
IF TEMP
BREAK
PRINT TRY AGAIN

THERE ARE NO STATEMENTS UNDERNEATH THE WHILE STATEMENT TO THE USER FOR ADDITIONAL INPUT TO A NEW VALUE TO TEMP
THERE'S AN ART TO WRITING REGULAR EXPRESSIONS THAT ARE FAST FOR EXAMPLE THAT AT THE BEGINNING ISN'T DOING ANYTHING USEFUL AND IS JUST EATING UP TIME AND YOU CAN COMBINE THEM INTO ONE REGEL IF YOU CAN MAKE A FEW CONCESSIONS

2 FOR M IN R NRL WINDOW LOCATION S S RESTRING

THIS WILL MATCH EITHER QUOTING STYLE AND WILL REJECT MIXED QUOTES EAST G NRL FOO WON'T MATCH BUT IT WON'T CATCH EMBEDDED QUOTES SUCH AS NRL FOO BAR IF THESE ARE BURLS CHANCES ARE THAT EMBEDDED QUOTES WOULD BE URLENCODED ANYWAY SO THAT'S PROBABLY NOT AN ISSUE BUT EVEN IF IT IS YOU CAN AT LEAST REDUCE THIS TO TWO PASSES FROM FOUR WHICH WILL HALVE THE TIME IT TAKES FROM WHAT YOU HAVE CURRENTLY


PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT HEML CAN NOT BE PROPERLY PARSED WITH REGEL IT'S FINE FOR A HACK BUT DON'T DO THIS ANYWHERE WHERE THE RESULTS CAN COMPROMISE SECURITY
I THINK COMPILING THE REGEL BEFORE USING IT IS A LITTLE FASTER

ARE YOU PARSING A WHOLE HEML FILE OR JUST JAVASCRIPT

PARSING HEML WITH REGEL IS GENERALLY A BAD IDEA

IF YOU'RE PARSING A WHOLE HEML FILE IT'S ALMOST DEFINITELY BETTER TO PARSE IT WITH SOMETHING LIKE LAMEL AND ONLY RUN YOUR REGEL ON THE ACTUAL JAVASCRIPT CODE

IS YOUR STRING JAVASCRIPT IF SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE A JAVASCRIPT PARSER A SHOT FOR EXAMPLE
YOU SHOULD POST THIS IN R LEARNPYTHON
YOU'LL NEED TO SHOW WHERE YOU ARE CALLING APPLICATIONFORM AS WELL
IF WAIT IS FALSE THEN THIS METHOD WILL RETURN IMMEDIATELY AND THE RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXECUTOR WILL BE FREED WHEN ALL PENDING FUTURES ARE DONE EXECUTING REGARDLESS OF THE VALUE OF WAIT THE ENTIRE PYTHON PROGRAM WILL NOT EXIT UNTIL ALL PENDING FUTURES ARE DONE EXECUTING
ALSO YOU CAN TRY CANCEL METHOD OF A FUTURE OBJECT OR JUST RAISE AN EXCEPTION WITH EXCEPTION METHOD OF THE SAME OBJECT
YOUR QUESTION IS BAD WRITTEN

SBA IS EASIER TO USE WITH EXCEL BUT PYTHON IS A GREAT LANGUAGE FOR WRITING AUTOMATING APPLICATIONS SCRIPTS

FOR EXCEL YOU HAVE XLSXWRITER AND BLOWINGS YOUR UNDO REMARK IS WRONG USING PYTHON OR ACK DOES NOT MAKE YOU LOSE THE UNDO OPTION IT WILL DEPEND ON HOW YOU WRITE THE CODE AND THE FEATURES THE LIBRARY SUPPORT

ACK IS EASIER FOR WRITING GAME BOTS BUT PYTHON HAS SEVERAL GUI AUTOMATION LIBRARIES LIKE PYAUTOGUI A COOL TUTORIAL ON MAKING A FLASH GAME BOT IS THIS ONE

PROFESSIONAL GAME BOTS ARE USUALLY WRITTEN IN C OR C FOR BETTER LOW-LEVEL INTEGRATION WITH WINDOWS AND EASIER INJECTIONS IN THAT CASE YOU CAN USE COTHON THAT INTEGRATES DIRECTLY WITH COUNTY
CHAPTER OF IS ABOUT WORKING WITH EXCEL USING PYTHON
RE SBA
SBA IS REALLY RESTRICTED IN WHAT IT CAN BE USED FOR IT'S ALMOST STRICTLY FOR MS OFFICE APPS WITH THAT SAID IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN USE IF THE INTERACTION YOU WANT IS ALMOST ENTIRELY INSIDE THE APPLICATION AND CAN BRING A LOT OF POWER

RE ACK
ACK AUTOMATES MOUSE AND KEYSTROKES IT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A MACRO PROGRAM YES IT CAN DO A LOT MORE THEN THAT BUT THAT'S WHERE IT'S PRIMARY FOCUS AND INSPIRATION COMES FROM

IT'S A GREAT PRODUCTIVITY TOOL BUT IT MAY BE LACKING FOR GAMES A LOT OF GAMES PURPOSEFULLY STOP HOOKS AND INTERACTION WITH THEM AND A LOT OF EXTRA WORK GOES INTO WRITING THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONALITY INSIDE OF GAMES IT MIGHT BE EASIER FOR YOUR GAME IF IT DOES WORK BECAUSE YOU JUST THINK IN TERMS OF HOW YOU'D NEED TO INTERACT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO THINK LIKE A PROGRAMMER

RE PYTHON
POWERFUL AND VERSATILE JUST READ THIS SUBREDDIT FOR A WHILE TO SEE WHAT IT CAN DO
A
HAVE YOU EVER DONE SOMETHING ON YOUR COMPUTER AND THOUGHT TO YOURSELF WOW THAT WAS HARDER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THAT'S WHAT SCRIPTING LANGUAGES LIKE PYTHON WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR AND IS TYPICALLY A GREAT WAY TO GET STARTED

ONE OF MY FIRST PROJECTS WAS USING PYTHON TO RENAME A BUNCH OF FILES ON MY HARD DRIVE THERE WERE PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT DID IT BUT NONE THAT DID EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED AND IT WAS DRIVING ME CRAZY SO I TOOK ONE OF THE PROGRAMS WHICH HAD BEEN CODED IN PYTHON AND CHANGED IT SO THAT IT WORKED FOR ME

PYTHON CAN DO SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT THOUGH IT'S A PHENOMENAL TOOL FOR STEM RESEARCH DATA VISUALIZATION IT'S A WEB DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM IT'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS

BUT YOU'VE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING THAT'S INTERESTING TO YOU FOR WHATEVER REASON AND START USING PYTHON JUST LIKE WITH A SPOKEN LANGUAGE IF YOU'RE NOT USING IT REGULARLY YOU WILL SOON FORGET IT
HOEING CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT THIS IS
WELL WHAT ARE YOU INTERESTED IN MACHINE LEARNING WEB DEVELOPMENT AUTOMATED PROCESSES WHATEVER YOU WANT THERE'S FRAMEWORKS FOR IT AND TUTORIALS FOR HOW TO USE THEM
HAVE A BROWSE SEE IF THERE ARE ANY PROJECTS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

TRENDING PYTHON

WHEN YOU FIND ONE THAT'S INTERESTING READ IT CAREFULLY AND HELP THEM OUT BY WRITING SOME UNIT TESTS AND OR PYDOCS
START WITH SMALL AND USEFUL SCRIPTS FOR YOU OWN USE
THIS BOOK MAY BE USEFUL
THIS ISN'T A GUIDE FOR BEGINNERS AND IT ISN'T A A LEARNING RESOURCE AT ALL AS IT'S NOT ACTUALLY TEACHING ANYTHING IT'S MORE OF AN INTRODUCTORY SHOWCASE WITH A COUPLE TASKS

I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE LOOKING TO START WITH SCRAPY TO SKIP THIS AND GO TO THE SCRAPY DOCS IT'S A LONGER READ BUT IT WILL ACTUALLY EQUIP YOU DO WRITE A FUNCTIONAL SPIDER SCRAPER

YOUR PROJECT IS MISSING KEY POINTS EVERY BEGINNER SHOULD KNOW INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

SCRAPY CORE COMPONENTS FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDING INFORMATION ON WHAT THE SETTINGS FILE ITEMS PIPELINES MIDDLEWARDS ETC THIS SHOULD ALL BE THE FIRST THING NEW PEOPLE LEARN SO THEY UNDERSTAND HOW SCRAPY IS DOING WHAT IT DOES
NO INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ON CONCEPTS AND METHODS THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO SCRAPY SUCH AS CALLBACKS SELECTORS ITEMLOADERS REQUESTS RESPONSES ETC
NO INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ON THE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS FURTHERMORE THOSE YOU DO PROVIDE WON'T EVEN WORK YOU SUGGEST THEY RUN A SPIDER NAMED HM WHICH DOESN'T EXIST BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN TALKED ABOUT THE CODE IT WOULD RUN IF IT DID NONE OF THE COMMANDS ARE EXPLAINED AND NEW PEOPLE WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON

WORSE THEN NEGLECTING ALL OF THAT YOUR PROJECT TEACHES PEOPLE THE WRONG WAY TO DO THINGS OF NOTE

THE VARIABLE ENTRY ISN'T USED YOU IMPLEMENTED IT BY OVERRIDING WHICH YOU NEVER EXPLAINED WHY DO THIS AT ALL JUST HARD CODE THE TO THE NRL YOU WANT
YOU DON'T USE THE DEFAULT CALLBACK OF PARSE FOR STARTING PAGES INSTEAD OPTING FOR AND AGAIN CALLBACKS AREN'T EXPLAINED AT ALL ANYTHING TRYING THIS WITH THEIR OWN SPIDER WILL FAIL
YOU INSTRUCT PEOPLE THAT TASKED IS BOTH COMMON AND IMPORTANT BUT FAIL TO INDICATE IT'S NOT USED IN ANY SPIDER EXCEPT YOUR OWN AND YOU FAIL TO EXPLAIN HOW
YOU TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE CLASS AND TRY AND EXPLAIN THAT ALL DATA SHOULD BE DUMPED AS A DICTIONARY INTO A CALLED DATA THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS AND NOT HOW ITEMS SHOULD BE EXPLAINED TO A BEGINNER
YOU USE GLOBAL SELECTORS AND LOAD WHAT WOULD BE LENGTHY LISTS OF ITEMS DATA ON A REAL PAGE ALL BECAUSE YOU FAIL TO USE ITEMS PROPERLY OR ITEMLOADERS
LIES ABOUT WRITING TESTS SAYING THERE'S NO GOOD WAY WHEN THERE ARE IN FACT SPIDER CONTRACTS
YOU RECOMMEND BAD LOGGING PRACTICES LOG A SINGLE EVENT BROKEN UP ONTO MULTIPLE LINES ANS DUMPING THE ENTIRE HEML SOURCE TO A LOG FILE UNDER THE INFO LEVEL ETC

ADD TO THIS ALL OF TYPOS BECAUSE SCRAWL HAVE TASKS DOUCE ETC AND POOR ENGLISH AND YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT THAT'S HARD TO GET THROUGH AND UNDERSTAND AND WORSE FOR YOU IF YOU DO

APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE NOT A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER BUT THAT DOESN'T DETRACT FROM THE DIFFICULTY IN READING THROUGH THE DOCUMENTATION
DID YOU JUST WEAKLY TYPE MY GENDER
YOU'RE USING AN WHEN YOU SHOULD USE AN ABORT RETRY FAIL DON'T ASSUME THAT IF SOMEONE ISN'T FEMALE THAT THEY'RE MALE I MEAN THAT IN THE LOGICAL SENSE NOT IN THE SENSE

DEPENDING YOUR COUNTRY CONTEXT THOUGH YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD OPTIONS THOUGH
SO MUCH FOR INPUT VALIDATION
I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR CODE NOW
A WHILE TRUE BREAK LOOP COULD HELP YOU HERE

YOU MAY WANT TO SANITIZE THE INPUT FROM THE USER TO MAKE IT ONE CASE
OR USE SOMETHING LIKE WHILE DOING COMPARISONS
WHILE TRUE
CHOICE WHAT IS YOUR GENDER
IF CHOICE M OR CHOICE M
DO SOMETHING
GENDER M
BREAK
ALIF CHOICE F OR CHOICE F

M F APACHE HELICOPTER
IF YOU WANT SOME HELP WRITING YOUR GAME I'D BE GLAD TO HELP I'VE GOT SOME EXPERIENCE
SORRY TO ASK A KIND OF QUESTION BUT WHAT IDE ARE YOU USING THIS LOOKS LIKE INTERLIE OR ANDROID STUDIO BUT FOR PYTHON
WHAT IDE IS THAT
HERE'S THE UK GOVERNMENT'S ADVICE ON ASKING USERS FOR GENDER
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO FORCE A GENDER ON A GAME PLAYER IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A PLOT TWIST DO IT LIKE INFOCOM DID IT IN LEATHER GODDESS OF PHOEBE OTHERWISE DROP THE QUESTION ENTIRELY UNLESS YOU NEED THE STATISTICS FOR ADVERTISERS

HOW TO MAKE THIS EASIER TAKE GENDER AS A STRING NOT A BOOLEAN SOLVES ALL YOUR PROBLEMS AND MAKES YOUR GAME NOT NOWADAYS IF I SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT I DROP THE GAME LIKE A HOT BLOCK OF TAR
VERY INTERESTING THE ARTICLE SEEMS TO END RATHER ABRUPTLY THOUGH WITH A HEADING
LOOKS LIKE A FASCINATING ARTICLE BUT I HAD TO COME BACK TO REDDIN TO COMMENT BEFORE CONTINUING PAST THE FIRST CODE BLOCK THE CODE BLOCKS AREN'T MONOSPACE
THIS IS FABULOUS LOOKING INTO IT RIGHT NOW IF I UNDERSTOOD IT'S HUMAN READABLE CONSTRAINTS
ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY LET'S SAY I WANT TO EMBED IT IN A PYSPARK APPLICATION WILL IT BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH
I DON'T REALLY SEE THIS SIMPLIFYING THIS MUCH AT ALL ASSUMING WE STICK TO THE SAME DATA STRUCTURES WE COULD EASILY WRITE

HOMER BART LISA MAGGIE MARGE BART LISA MAGGIE ABE HOMER
X FOR X IN IF BART IN X
X FOR X IN FOR Y IN IF Y IN X

THROWING TOGETHER A QUICK GENERATOR WOULD MAKE CREATING EACH LIST EVEN SHORTER FURTHERMORE LOOKING AT YOUR LATER BIG EXAMPLE THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY IS REPRODUCED WITH SIMPLE LOGIC

FOR ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH PYTHON
THE GRAND PARENTS RELATIONSHIP COULD BE EASILY SOLVED BY USING JASON AND FOR PARENT P2 IN BART PARENT GET PARENT AND SAME FOR P2 THE SYNTAX REMINDS ME OF SQL AND R SOMEWHAT
THIS IS THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN
IT'S NOT TOTALLY RIDICULOUS BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO BE OVERLOOKING

SECURITY IF YOU'RE DOWNLOADING CODE AT AN ABSOLUTE MINIMUM IT SHOULD BE OVER HTTPS AND HOW SECURE IS THAT DOMAIN WHERE YOU HOST IT
2 CACHING IF YOU WANT YOUR APPLICATION TO BE USABLE WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION YOU NEED TO STORE THE CODE SOMEWHERE LOCALLY AND DECIDE WHEN TO USE THAT VERSUS DOWNLOADING THE LATEST CODE
USERS STILL NEED TO INSTALL AT LEAST PYTHON AND YOUR LAUNCHER SCRIPT TO RUN THE APPLICATION SO IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE DISTRIBUTION QUESTION
I'M BY NO MEANS AN EXPERT AND I'M NOT SURE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WILL BE AT MOST UNIQUE COMBINATIONS OF PRIMES THUS ONLY THAT MANY UNIQUE CYPHERS THAT'S NOT REALLY A LOT
THE WAY TO PREPROCESS RAW TEXT IS TO FIRST SPLIT ON WHITESPACE STRIP PUNCTUATION AND INVALID CHARACTERS LOWERCASE THE TOKENS THEN REMOVE STOP WORDS

ANY REASON WAS NOT USED FOR TERM WEIGHTS

NOLT IS STRICTLY A TEACHING TOOL IT IS EASY AND SIMPLE BECAUSE IT IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSES IT SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION
A VERY WELCOME FEATURE I'VE WORKED A FEW TIMES WITH TO WRITE PYTHON CODE AND IT'S GREAT A FULL-FLEDGED DEBUGGER WILL MAKE IT EVEN BETTER RIGHT NOW YOU CAN'T WATCH LOCALS OR EVALUATE EXPRESSIONS WITH THE DEBUGGER SO I FIND THAT THERE'S NO REAL USE TO IT I GUESS THAT THIS IS MORE LIKE A HOWEVER THIS IS A VERY GOOD START
THIS SUBREDDIT IS NOT

THIS SUBREDDIT IS NOT R LEARNPYTHON

IF YOU HAVE AN ERROR YOU MUST TRY AND SOLVE IT YOURSELF DEALING WITH EXCEPTIONS IS A BIG PART OF PROGRAMMING AND LEARNING TO DO IT YOURSELF IS VITAL
HERE IS A PICTURE OF THE ERROR I GET WHEN I TRY PIP INSTALL REQUESTS SECURITY
IF YOU'RE GOOD AT WHAT YOU DO I DON'T CARE WHAT DEGREE YOU HAVE

IF YOU'RE BAD AT WHAT YOU DO I ALSO DON'T CARE WHAT DEGREE YOU HAVE

THE SOFTWARE WORLD REALLY IS PRETTY MUCH A MERITOCRACY AND ONE WITH A LOW BARRIER TO ENTRY AT THAT GO AND READ PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS AND YOU'LL ALREADY BE BETTER EQUIPPED THAN A LOT OF STATS EXPERTS I'VE MET
ID SAY BEING ABLE TO MUNG DATA WITH PYTHON R WILL GET YOU SOME PRETTY COOL JOBS GET GOOD EXCEL AND LEARN HOW TO USE PYTHONS PACKAGES TO MANIPULATE EXCEL STUFF
YOU COULD MAYBE GET AN ENTRY LEVEL JOB IN A PLACE THAT USES SAS BUT IN TERMS OF ADDING ANOTHER STRING TO YOUR BOW R WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE FOR YOU AT THIS STAGE THERE WILL BE PLACES THAT MAKE USE OF SAS AND R BUT I DON'T RECALL EVER SEEING A JOB ADVERT CALLING FOR PYTHON AND SAS THAT DIDN'T ALSO REQUIRE R

THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE SAS AND R TEND TO BE USED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE STATISTICIANS WHO MINOR IN CODE VERSUS PYTHON WHICH IS OFTEN USED BY CODERS WHO KNOW A LITTLE STATS YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE LUCK GETTING A JOB WITH THE STATS HEAVY FOLKS IF THAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND

BUT BY ALL MEANS LEARN PYTHON IT'S WAY FUN
THE SOURCE CODE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE HOSTED SOMEWHERE LIKE GITHUB SO I CAN'T SUPER EASILY LINK YOU TO LINES HOWEVER IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE SOURCE FROM HERE

PEPI GOOGLE

AND THEN LOOK AT LINE OF GOOGLE PY THERE IS THE FOLLOWING

SLEEP BETWEEN REQUESTS
PAUSE

I STEPPED THROUGH A DEBUGGER AND MY DEFAULT VALUE WAS SET TO 2 SECONDS THE PAUSE IS A PARAMETER YOU CAN APPARENTLY SPECIFY IN THE SEARCH FUNCTION BUT THERE IS THE FOLLOWING WARNING IN THE DOCS

PAUSE FLOAT
PAUSE LAPSE TO WAIT BETWEEN HETP REQUESTS
A LAPSE TOO LONG WILL MAKE THE SEARCH SLOW BUT A LAPSE TOO SHORT MAY
CAUSE GOOGLE TO BLOCK YOUR IP YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY

THIS IS JUST A NETWORK ISSUE YOU COULD RELEASE THE GIL OR USE ASYNCIO BUT THAT'S ALL OVERKILL AND NOT REALLY THE ISSUE HERE


USE EITHER PYTHON THREADS OR MULTIPROCESSING OR ASYNC

EACH TIME YOU QUERY GOOGLE YOU'RE TAKING A SPEED HIT THREADS WOULD LET YOUR CODE RUN WHILE GOOGLE IS WAITING TO RESPOND OR MULTIPROCESSING WOULD LET YOU RUN MULTIPLE SESSIONS OF PYTHON AT ONCE ASYNC RUNS SIMILAR TO THREADS BUT IS EASIER TO USE

I WOULD TRY ASYNC FIRST IF YOU'RE ON PYTHON
GOOD VIDEO KEEP EM COMING
HI I'M THE DEV ADVOCATE FOR PYCHARM SUPER VIDEO AND GOOD COMMENTS HERE AS WELL
YOU CAN CTRL CLICK ON A FUNCTION AND GO TO ITS DEFINITION ON A FUNCTION DEFINITION WILL BRING UP A LIST OF PLACES ITS USED THAT YOU CAN THEN CLICK ON TO GO TO

EDIT ANOTHER THING I LIKE IS THAT YOU CAN MAKE CUSTOM IN THE SETTINGS

FILE SETTINGS EDITOR TODO

YOU CAN ADD REFLEXES FOR TODO HIGHLIGHTING AND MAKE CUSTOM FILTERS I DO THIS TO WORK WITH TODOS MODELING ASSUMPTIONS CODE TO GO BACK TO ETC
THE RIGHT CLICK MENU HAS SOME COOL STUFF TOO THAT I REALLY LIKE

COMPARE WITH CLIPBOARD
LOCAL HISTORY
COLUMN SELECTION MODE
EXECUTE LINE IN CONSOLE

OR HIGHLIGHT SOME CODE THEN

EXECUTE SELECTION IN CONSOLE

SOME OTHER FEATURES I LIKE

RECORD MACROS UNDER THE EDIT MENU ALTHOUGH KEYBOARD MACROS MY USUAL

CLICK THE HYPERLINKS IN THE TRACEBACK TO BRING UP THE SOURCE CODE IT TAKES YOU RIGHT TO THE LINE LAST CALLED

FILE SETTINGS EDITOR GENERAL SMART KEYS SURROUND SELECTION ON TYPING QUOTE OR BRACE

NOW YOU CAN DOUBLE CLICK HIGHLIGHT AND SURROUND SELECTION WITH QUOTES BRACES PARENTHESIS ETC BY TYPING ONE BUTTON YOU'RE WELCOME

RIGHT CLICK FILE TABS AND SPLIT VERTICALLY HORIZONTALLY TO HAVE MULTIPLE FILES DISPLAYED CONCURRENTLY

CREATE A TEMPLATE BY WRITING SOME CODE CLICKING TOOLS SAVE FILE AS TEMPLATE USE A TEMPLATE BY CREATING A NEW FILE BUT INSTEAD OF SELECTING PYTHON FILE SELECT ONE OF YOUR PREPAVED TEMPLATES

CLICK EXTERNAL LIBRARIES WHICH IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PROJECT MENU ON THE LEFT YOU CAN QUICKLY ACCESS ALL YOUR INSTALLED LIBRARIES

THANKS FOR THIS QUITE NEW TO PYCHARM AND FAIRLY NEW TO REALLY PUTTING SOME EFFORT INTO LEARNING TO PROGRAM I GOT THE FEELING THAT PYCHARM WAS GOOD BUT CLEARLY THERE ARE EVEN MORE AMAZING FEATURES THANKS FOR THIS SUBSCRIBED TO THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE
FINISH THIS PROJECT THAT TODO COMMENT
PYCHARM FEATURE THAT I USED MOST ARE


GO TO CLASS CTRL N CAND N
IT HELPS IF I HAD PROJECTS WITH BUNCH APPS I ONLY REMEMBER CLASS NAME BUT TOO LAZY TO FIND OUT THE FILE ON PROJECT PANEL

SEARCH EVERYWHERE DOUBLE SHIFT
IT HELPS IF I HAD BUNCH OF HELPER FUNCTION AND I DON'T REMEMBER THE DEFINITION LOCATION I JUST NEED TO TYPE FUNCTION NAME AND PYCHARM WILL SEARCH FOR ME

VERY HELPFUL TO SAVE SECONDS TO FIND MANUALLY
IS THE DATABASE VIEW IN THE COMMUNITY EDITION I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND IT ANYWHERE
BOOKMARKS TIP COULD BE BETTER WITH TASK CONTEXTS
HEY THERE I USE PYTHON FOR MANY ACCOUNTING TASKS INCLUDING TRANSPARENCY REPORTING AND STREAMLINING THE PAYABLES PROCESS I ALSO USE IT TO HELP ANSWER SOME OF MY EMAILS I USE PYTHON TO DISTRIBUTE INVOICES ACROSS THE OFFICE SO COWORKERS CAN LEGITIMATE BILLS
WORK IN FINANCE USE PYTHON SBA EXCEL PBS DERP
I'M CONSIDERING USING PYTHON FOR THIS KIND OF WORK BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START

WHAT WERE YOUR FIRST IMPLEMENTATIONS
I'M A CPA WHO IS A FORENSIC ACCOUNTANT I USE PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS VISUALIZATION AND DOING BORING STUFF THAT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG IN EXCEL
THE DISCOVERY THAT A MINIMAL FILE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY EASY

WHEN MY OWN PACKAGES BECAME TRIVIAL THAT WAS REALLY NICE SUDDENLY I COULD HAVE MY PROJECT IN ANY DIRECTORY PIP INSTALL IT AND USE IT IN A PROJECT IN ANY OTHER DIRECTORY THAT MADE SPLITTING FUNCTIONALITY INTO ITS OWN PACKAGE SO MUCH EASIER

HERE'S YOUR DIRECTORY

HELLO PUBLIC

AS WELL AS OR INSTEAD OF A PACKAGES ARGUMENT POINTING AT A DIRECTORY YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A MODULES ARGUMENT POINTING AT A PY FILE USEFUL IF YOUR PACKAGE IS JUST A SINGLE-FILE MODULE

EDIT U FLORENCIA POINTED
OUT THAT THE PACKAGES ARGUMENT DOES NOT WORK WHEN POINTED AT A FILE INSTEAD OF A DIRECTORY X X PY TOOK THAT OCCASION TO MAKE THIS ENTIRE COMMENT MORE AND ALSO ADD U PIP E TIP

MASTERING GENERATORS
UNDERSTANDING HOW ITERATION REALLY WORKS IN PYTHON OPENS UP MANY POSSIBILITIES FOR ELEGANT HIGH PERFORMANCE CODE USE PYTHON LEARN THAT FOR DOES TUPLE UNPACKING PLAY WITH ZIP ENUMERATE ALL ANY TAKE A LOOK AT THE ITERTOOLS MODULE STUDY GENERATOR FUNCTIONS FOCUS ON PLAIN GENERATORS NOT COROUTINES THAT'S ALSO INTERESTING BUT ANOTHER SUBJECT SO FOCUS ON NEXT G FORGET ABOUT THAT'S FOR ABUSING GENERATORS AS COROUTINES LIST SET DICT COMPREHENSIONS ARE NICE SYNTAX SUGAR GENERATOR EXPRESSIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT
UNIT TESTS PERTEST IN PARTICULAR GIVES YOU A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE ON YOUR CODE AND DAMMIT IT'S SO SATISFYING TO GET ALL THOSE GREEN OK

FINALLY

PYTHON
MANAGING VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS

OH AND REALISING EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT
NOT USING CLASSES UNTIL I NEEDED THEM
FOR ME IT WAS LIST COMPREHENSIONS IT GOT ME THINKING MORE IN THE TERMS OF LOOPS LIST PROCESSING REFRACTURING SO I CAN CREATE THE LOOPS MORE EASILY ETC THAT LEAD INTO GENERATORS AND SO ON
I'VE BEEN USING PYTHON FOR A LONG TIME I'M AN EARLY PERL APOSTATE SO I'M NOT ALWAYS UP ON THE NEWEST STUFF

FOR ME REALLY DIGGING INTO CONTEXT MANAGERS HAS RESULTED IN THE BIGGEST CHANGES TO HOW I PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE BIGGEST BENEFIT
DEFINITELY AGREE WITH SEVERAL OF THE ITEMS MENTIONED ALREADY PYCHARM GENERATORS CLOSURES SO HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT CHANGED HOW I WRITE PYTHON

DECORATORS

BEING ABLE TO SLAP OR SECS ON TOP OF A FUNCTION DEFINITION REALLY SIMPLIFIES THE CODEBASE
CODE REVIEWS

TRY TO WORK ON A PROJECT WITH OTHER PEOPLE OR SOME OPEN SOURCE GITHUB PROJECT
PANDAS DATAFRAMES
I FOUND USING ADB LIBERALLY FOR LARGER PROJECTS HAS HELPED IMMENSELY

IMPORT ADB

ADB

WILL PAUSE THE SHELL AT THE POINT THAT YOU INPUT THE ABOVE LETS YOU MEDDLE WITH VARIABLES SEE WHAT VALUES ARE SET TO AT THAT POINT IN THE CODE I'VE FOUND IT ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR DEBUGGING DURANGO TEMPLATE TAGS THAT JUST AREN'T WORKING THE WAY I WANT THEM TO

EDIT FIXED FOR U KIMPEEK
LEARNING A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WITH A DIFFERENT PARADIGM SPECIFICALLY I LEARNED HASKELL IT INTRODUCED A LOT OF NEW APPROACHES TO SOLVING PROBLEMS MANY OF WHICH I COULD APPLY IN PYTHON NOW IT ALSO MADE ME DISLIKE PYTHON AND I NOW TRY TO DO ALL MY PROJECTS IN HASKELL SO TAKE THIS ADVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK
PYCHARM EDITOR
READING HIGH QUALITY CODE FROM BIG LIBRARIES SEEING BEST PRACTICES AND CODING THAT WAY

I ALREADY LEARNED ABOUT CLASSES WITH FLASK I COULD USE THEM FOR FUNCTIONAL CODE MY PROGRAMS GOT FAR COMPLEXER BUT THE DOCUMENTATION AND STYLE IMPROVED QUICKLY SINCE USING FLASK I SEE MYSELF AS A REAL PROGRAMMER
CODE QUALITY TOOLS FLAKE MOPY RADON TO NAME A FEW THE CODE INSPECTIONS PYCHARM CAN DO ARE ALSO EXTREMELY USEFUL
UNDERSTANDING METACLASSES THEY AREN'T USEFUL FREQUENTLY BUT SOMETIMES THEY JUST FIT A NEED SO WELL THAT THEY'RE A BEAUTIFUL SOLUTION I THINK I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT OR THAT ARE ACTUALLY USED IN PRODUCTION CODE BUT THEY SIMPLIFIED MY CODE BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ONCE INTRODUCED IN PARTICULAR I FIND THEM GREAT WHEN WRITING WHAT AMOUNT TO SMALL FRAMEWORKS WHENEVER I HAVE TO WRITE CODE THAT ACTS AS THE STRUCTURE FOR OTHERS TO BUILD THEIR APPLICATIONS ON THEY SEEM TO CROP UP
LOOKING AT A FEW SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE PYTHON SOURCE CODE TO GET A FEEL FOR WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON

THE GRAMMAR

THE BUILTIN TYPES OF OBJECTS
PYTHON FILE TIP OBJECTS

THE VIRTUAL MACHINE LOOP THAT RUNS PYTHON OPCODE
GREAT QUESTION TURK

FOR ME IT WASN'T TOOLS TUTORIALS MODULES IT WAS WHEN I STARTED MAKING STUFF THAT I USE EVERY DAY THAT'S A BIG THING YOU GET A SURGE OF SATISFACTION WHEN YOU LOG IN REMINDERS AND FEEDBACK AS YOU USE IT A SLOWLY GROWING DESIRE TO MAKE IT BETTER AND NEW IDEAS FOR FURTHER PROJECTS

I'VE GOT FOUR THINGS ON MY DESKTOP THAT I WROTE MYSELF A MENU BUTTON A SHUTDOWN APPLICATION A SORT OF INFO BAR PANEL AND THE NEWEST ITEM A TODO LIST APPLICATION THE LATTER JUST TODAY REPLACED THE SAME JOB AS FOUR CONKY SCRIPTS AND IT LOOKS A LOT BETTER I HAVE A COUPLE MORE THINGS TO MAKE AND THEN THE PRESENTATION OF MY ENTIRE DESKTOP WILL BE STUFF I MADE

BEHIND THE SCENES I HAVE ABOUT MINOR SCRIPTS READY TO GO MOSTLY JUST LITTLE THINGS LIKE UNIT CONVERSION SUCH AS CELSIUS TO FAHRENHEIT AND BACK BUT ALSO SOME MORE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE SCRIPTS TO MANIPULATE THE TODO LISTS ONE THAT SETS A RANDOM WALLPAPER ON LOG IN CURATORS WHEN I GET SICK OF ONE ONE THAT THAT BACKS UP MY CURRENT OPEN BROWSER TABS AND FAVORITES LIST AND SO ON

WHEN YOU START OWNING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF YOUR COMPUTER YOU START SETTING ACHIEVABLE MEANINGFUL GOALS TECHNIQUES AND TRICKS WHICH WERE INTERESTING AND COOL BECOME USEFUL AND SATISFYING
I'M WORKING MY WAY THROUGH PROJECT EULER

ARCHIVES

FORCES ME TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT HOW I APPROACH A PROBLEM MAKES ME MUCH MORE FACILE WITH ARRAY MANIPULATION AND STUFF LIKE LIST COMPREHENSION
AFTER I MADE MY FIRST
LEARNING HASKELL
LEARNING FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH YOU CAN TRANSFER FROM LANGUAGES F IN THIS CASE TO PYTHON
METAPROGRAMMING

IN GENERAL IF YOU'RE SOLVING A PROBLEM WITH METAPROGRAMMING YOU'RE PROBABLY DOING IT WRONG IT'S A LOT OF CLEVERNESS THAT CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO READABILITY AND THERE ARE MANY BETTER WAYS TO HANDLE WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT THERE ARE A FEW CASES

UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE CLASS CREATION PATTERN FOR EXAMPLE

CLASS FOO BAR
DEF SELF Y
SELF Y Y
DEF X
RETURN SELF Y X

COULD BE WRITTEN LIKE

TYPE FOO BAR Y Y LAMBDA X X Y

LIKE OK THAT'S TERRIBLE AND YOUR PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BUT THERE ARE SOME CASES LET'S SAY YOU'RE TRYING TO WRITE A NITTIEST AROUND SOMETHING THAT INHERITS BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE A INHERITED BY YOUR UNITTESTS BECAUSE THE NITTIEST RUNNER WILL CORRECTLY IDENTIFY IT AS A NITTIEST AND TRY TO RUN IT IF YOU UNDERSTAND METACLASSES YOU COULD MAKE A NEW OBJECT THAT IS EXACTLY LIKE THE ORIGINAL ONLY IT STUBS OUT THAT PROBLEMATIC INHERITANCE

I FIND MYSELF PULLING OUT METACLASSES ANY TIME I NEED TO STUB OUT SOMETHING COMPLICATED FOR TESTCASES I ALSO FIND MYSELF MUCH FASTER AT WORKING WITH BLACKBOY UNDOCUMENTED PYTHON CODE I HAVE ALL THE TOOLS I NEED TO INSPECT IT NOW BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT UNDERSTANDING HOW THINGS WORK UNDER THE SURFACE GAVE ME SOME NEW TOOLS FOR SOLVING COMPLICATED PROBLEMS ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS YOU CAN START MAKING DYNAMIC CODE THAT CHANGES BASED ON HOW WHY AND WHERE IT'S CALLED SOMETIMES WITH COMPLICATED PROBLEMS OR LEGACY CODE YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT OF MAGIC TO MAKE THINGS WORK
DATAFRAMES MAKE DATA IO FORMATTING VISUALIZATION AND CLEANING RIDICULOUSLY EASY IF ANYTHING IT'S A BIT OF A CRUTCH FOR ME
PROTOCOLS

A PROTOCOL IS BASICALLY A SET OF SPECIAL METHODS ETC IF YOUR CLASS IMPLEMENTS ALL THE METHODS OF THE GIVEN PROTOCOL THEN IT'S SAID TO IMPLEMENT THE PROTOCOL FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A BUNCH OF SPECIAL METHODS THAT YOUR CLASS CAN IMPLEMENT TO BE A MAPPING THIS WAY NOT ONLY OBJECTS OF YOUR CLASS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH OPERATORS SUCH AS KEY BUT YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU EVER ENCOUNTER A FUNCTION WHOSE ARGUMENT MUST BE A MAPPING OBJECTS OF YOUR CLASS CAN BE SAFELY PASSED TO THIS FUNCTION A MARRIAGE BETWEEN C OPERATOR OVERLOADING AND JAVA INTERFACES BASICALLY
I ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP METHODS FUNCTIONS TO LINES OR LESS THAT DOESN'T MEAN CRAM CODE INTO BUT SPLIT IT UP INTO SMALLER UNITS AND REMEMBER TO USE COMPREHENSIONS I FIND THIS PRACTICE MAKES ME THINK MORE CRITICALLY ABOUT MY CODE AS I WRITE IT AND IT ENDS UP MUCH MORE READABLE AND SEXY AS A RESULT
NOT PYTHON SPECIFIC BUT I'VE FOUND FUNCTION CLOSURES TO BE EXTREMELY USEFUL I OFTEN FIND MYSELF WANTING TO SAVE SOME SORT OF STATE BETWEEN FUNCTION CALLS BUT FEEL LIKE DEFINING A CLASS IS TOO MUCH
MASTERING USE OF RAW INTERACTIONS WITH PROFILE AND ADB AND LEARNING PROPER APPLICATION OF MAP FILTER LAMBDA
FOR ME IT WAS PYRAMID AND SQLALCHEMY INCREDIBLY POWERFUL COMBINATION THAT ALLOWS ME TO BUILD VERY COMPLEX AND FLEXIBLE WEB APPLICATIONS
PROFILE AND TIMET GAVE ME GREAT INSIGHT INTO WHAT THE INTERPRETER IS ACTUALLY DOING
FOR ME IT WAS DIVE INTO PYTHON AN ONLINE BOOK
PYTHON NOTEBOOKS GOD I LOVE THOSE EASY TO CHUNK UP AND EXECUTE YOUR CODE TRY LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS OUT FIGURE OUT BASIC ALGORITHMS

I'VE EVEN STARTED MAKING SOME ONLINE BOOKS WITH THEM
REQUESTS LIBRARY AND JINJA 2
TAKING A FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING COURSE THAT WAS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO PYTHON MASTERING MORE GENERAL CONCEPTS ALLOWS ONE TO EASILY UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS WORK IN CONTRAST TO LEARNING HOW TO USE THEM WITHOUT KNOWING THE DETAILS FOR EXAMPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW PYTHON DECORATORS WORK ONE HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF FUNCTIONS BEEFING FIRST CLASS OBJECTS AND FUNCTION CLOSURES THESE ARE ALL WELL KNOWN TERMS IN THE FUNCTIONAL WORLD

LEARNING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPE SYSTEMS SCOPES ETC ALSO CHANGED THE WAY I WRITE CODE
TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT PUSHED ME TO LEARN A LOT OF THE OTHER PATTERNS TRICKS AND TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED HERE AND IT IS STILL PUSHING ME TO THINK MORE DEEPLY BEFORE I START WRITING ANY CODE
FOR ME IT WAS HAVING A FRIEND WHO KNEW PYTHON WAY BETTER THAN I DID REVIEW A PROJECT I WAS WORKING ON MY BACKGROUND BEFORE THAT HAD BEEN ALL C C SO I STILL HAD A LOT OF ARTIFACTS FROM THAT AND IT WAS MAKING SOME SIMPLE THINGS IN PYTHON UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED IT WAS ENLIGHTENING
GETTING A JOB WHERE PYTHON WAS THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE USED REALLY TOOK MY PYTHON TO THE NEXT LEVEL
ALWAYS LOG EVERYTHING IT WILL BE ONLY YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO DEBUG SOME LOGICAL ERROR YOU CAN'T REPRODUCE
WRITING BOTS CHANGED EVERYTHING BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN MY PROGRAMMING WENT FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE TRY WRITING REDDIN BOTS TO START BUT THEN MOVE ON TO TWITTER AND OTHER PLATFORMS YOU WOULD BE SURPRISE TO SEE WHAT IT DOES FOR YOU
SIMULATEME NICOLASGUACAMOLE
CLEAN AND SIMPLE CONCURRENCY
DOCUMENTATION PYTHON
LEARNING SCHEME AND WORKING THROUGH THE EXAMPLES IN ICP
REALISING THAT MOST TRADITIONAL OOP TECHNIQUES AREN'T GOOD PATTERNS IN PYTHON FOR EXAMPLE

NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE A CLASS UNLESS SOMETHING NEEDS TO HOLD STATE IT SHOULD PROBABLY BE A MODULE WITH PLAIN FUNCTION S

2 EMBRACE AND USE IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE AVOID NAMES THAT HAVE PROGRAMMING WORDS IN THEM A SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MOST OF YOUR CLASSES REPRESENT IN PYTHON THERE'S ALMOST NEVER A NEED FOR THINGS LIKE FOOFACTORY BARADAPTER OR BAZINTERFACE
I WROTE A DEBUGGER USING AND A OBJECT MAPPER WHICH REQUIRED UNDERSTANDING METACLASSES YOU LEARN A LOT ABOUT THE INTERNALS OF THE LANGUAGE AND A LOT OF THE NUANCE
I LOVE TYPE HINTING IT WHEN USED WITH AN IDE THAT SUPPORTS IT IT MAKES LIFE A LOT EASIER AND HAS SAVED ME FROM MANY A RUNTIME ERROR

LEARNING CLASSES NOT PYTHON BUT JESUS IT MADE MY RATHER LARGE ROUND ABOUT WAYS OF GETTING SOMETHING DONE A WHOLE LOT MORE SIMPLER
USING IN ONE OF PROJECTS FOR ME IT WAS A FIRST EXPERIENCE TO WORK WITH EVENTLOOP IN WEB
COLLECTIONS MODULE
GENERATORS
AND CLASSES BARELY USED THEM
PREGAME TINTER MATPLOTLIB BEAUTIFULSOUP AND FLASK ARE GREAT TOOLS TO CREATE NICE PYTHON APPLICATIONS
THIS IS PRETTY GENERAL BUT CREATING MY OWN CUSTOM IDE COLOR SCHEME HELPED ME A LOT I THINK
A LONG LONG TIME AGO LEANING THAT PYTHON VARIABLES AND MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY JUST ENTRIES IN SOME DICTIONARY AND FROM THERE TO METAPROGRAMMING WARP SPEED
LEARNING A SHIPLOAD OF OTHER LANGUAGES CAN GLADLY RECOMMEND IT HELPED NOT ONLY MY PYTHON
MY MOM SAID THAT PYTHON WAS NEAT AND THAT MADE ME WANT TO PYTHON
IT'S INTERESTING THAT DKM DECIDED TO PRESENT PARAMETERIZED FUNCTIONS RATHER THAN FIXTURES

IN MY EXPERIENCE PERTEST FIXTURES ARE BOTH MORE INTERESTING AND MORE USEFUL CONVENIENT PARAMETERIZED TESTS ARE NEAT BUT OTHERWISE EASY TO REPLICATE

FIXTURES ARE ANSWER TO SETUP TEARDOWN CONCERNS FILLING IN FOR MULTIPLE ISSUES SOME CAUSED BY PERTEST BUT MOST BEING INTRINSIC ISSUES OF SETUP AND TEARDOWN

SETUP AND TEARDOWN ARE DIFFICULT TO COMPOSE OME SMALL SETUP TEARDOWN MIXING LEAD TO COMPLEX INHERITANCE GRAPHS AND DON'T WORK THAT WELL SO I'VE TENDED TO RESORT TO BIGGER LESS REUSABLE OR REUSED ONES COMMONLY NO REUSE AT ALL OF THE METHODS AND SOME SETUP FUNCTIONS ON THE SIDE WHICH WOULD HOPEFULLY WORK
PROVIDING SET UP RESOURCES TO THE TESTS IS ANNOYING AS YOU HAVE TO SET THEM ON THE TEST INSTANCE THAT ALSO MAKES WHAT RESOURCES OR SET UP STEPS EACH TEST NEEDS VERY UNCLEAR
MEANS SETUP AND TEARDOWN OF A GIVEN RESOURCE ARE FAR APART AND MIXED WITH OTHER STUFF OTHER SETUPS AND TEARDOWNS SETUP CODE AND YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO TEARDOWN IN REVERSE ORDER FROM THE SETUP LEST YOU TEARDOWN A DEPENDENCY BEFORE ITS DEPENDENT AND THE TEARDOWN BLOWS UP OR WORSE
PARTIAL SETUP TEARDOWN A SUBSET OF THE SETUP BLOWING UP AFTER SOME OF IT HAS BEEN EXECUTED REALLY DOESN'T WORK IN CUNIT STYLE NITTIEST HAD TO GROW AN ADDCLEANUP METHOD MIXING ADDCLEANUP AND TEARDOWN DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK CORRECTLY BY DEFAULT CLEANUPS ARE ALL CALLED AFTER TEARDOWN
USING METHODS SCOPES A GROUP OF TESTS BRACKETED BY A SINGLE SETUP TEARDOWN PAIR ARE PRETTY INCONVENIENT OLDER NITTIEST ONLY HAD NEWER NITTIEST HAS CLASS AND MODULE REQUIRING DIFFERENT HOOK NAMES
BECAUSE THE CANONICAL TEST BUNDLE IN PERTEST IS A FUNCTION YOU CAN'T HAVE SETUP TEARDOWN METHODS

INSTEAD PERTEST USES FIXTURE FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE SIMPLY DECORATED WITH FIXTURE AND ARE PRETTY GOOD

FIXTURES ARE IF A TEST OR AN OTHER FIXTURE WANTS TO USE A FIXTURE THEY JUST REQUEST IT BY NAME EAST G

DEF SMTP


REQUESTS THE SMTP FIXTURE AND THAT'S IT FIXTURES WORK THE SAME WAY THEY CAN JUST REQUEST AN OTHER FIXTURE BY NAME TO EXPLICITLY DEPEND ON IT OR USE IT BECAUSE IT'S CONVENIENT AND EXPLICIT PERTEST PLUGGING AND EXTERNAL LIBRARIES VIA A BUNDLED PERTEST PUGIN CAN EASILY PROVIDE FIXTURES EAST G DURANGO COULD PROVIDE A SET OF PERTEST FIXTURES AS TESTING SUPPORT WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE ITS ENTIRE TESTING FRAMEWORK THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT
FIXTURES CAN EITHER RETURN AN OBJECT DIRECTLY WITH A NORMAL RETURN OR PERFORM SETUP TEARDOWN SIMILAR TO CONTEXTMANAGER DECORATED FUNCTIONS SET UP YIELD WITH AN OPTIONAL VALUE AND TEARDOWN EAST G

FIXTURE
DEF SMTP
S
YIELD S


THIS MAKES FOR SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS CODE WITH VERY LITTLE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SETUP AND TEARDOWN OF THE RESOURCE AND IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH CONTEXTMANAGERS

FIXTURE
DEF SMTP
WITH AS S
YIELD S

THESE STEPS ARE AUTOMATICALLY AND CORRECTLY ORDERED BETWEEN DEPENDENCIES SUCH THAT ALL DEPENDENTS OF A FIXTURE A ARE TORN DOWN BEFORE A IS
IF A FIXTURE SETUP FAILS ALL PREVIOUSLY SET UP FIXTURES WILL BE PROPERLY TORN DOWN IN REVERSE ORDER FIXTURES ENCOURAGE SMALL SELF-CONTAINED SETUP TEARDOWN FUNCTIONS ONE FIXTURE MANAGES ONE RESOURCE OR SETS UP ONE CONFIGURATION POINT OR CREATES ONE TYPE OF OBJECTS

NOW THESE ARE THE SIMPLE AND OBVIOUSLY CONVENIENT USE CASES BUT FIXTURES ALSO OPTIONALLY PROVIDE WAY MORE POWER THAN THAT

PERTEST FIXTURES HAVE A CONCEPT OF SCOPE AS A FIXTURE ATTRIBUTE SCOPE THIS DEFINES HOW LONG THE FIXTURE REMAINS ALIVE BEFORE BEING TORN DOWN THERE ARE SCOPES FUNCTION SETUP CLASS SETUPCLASS MODULE SETUPMODULE AND THEN THERE'S SESSION WHICH SCOPES THE FEATURE TO THE ENTIRE TEST SESSION VERY COOL FOR STUFF LIKE STARTING A TEST SERVER OR CONFIGURATION
PERTEST FIXTURES ARE LAZY PERTEST ALLOWS FILTERING TESTS USING TAGS OR REGEL OR WHATEVER AND FIXTURES WHICH ARE NEVER REQUESTED ARE NOT INSTANTIATED
FIXTURES CAN ALSO BE MARKED AS AUTOBUS IN WHICH CASE THE FIXTURE WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE USED FOR ALL FUNCTIONS MATCHING THE FIXTURE'S DEFINITION SCOPE EAST G AN AUTOBUS FIXTURE IN A MODULE WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL TESTS OF THAT MODULE BUT ONLY THEM WHEREAS A OR PUGIN AUTOBUS FIXTURE WILL BE APPLIED TO ALL TESTS OF THE PROJECT
FIXTURES CAN BE PARAMETERIZED AND WILL IN TURN AUTOMATICALLY PARAMETERIZE THEIR DEPENDENTS EAST G GIVEN

I'M JUST GETTING INTO PERTEST MYSELF AND I'VE BEEN COMBINING IT WITH HYPOTHESIS HETP WHICH I ENJOY A LOT ANYONE ELSE USING HYPOTHESIS WHY OR PERHAPS MORE INTERESTINGLY WHY NOT
I REALLY ENJOY THE PACKAGE NITTIEST IN THE STANDARD LIB

IT COULD BE A LITTLE MORE VERBOSE BUT I REALLY ENJOY THE MODULARITY OF THE TESTCASE CLASS WITH SETUP CLASS TEARDOWN CLASS WELL MANAGED THROUGH THE EXCEPTION

ALSO APPRECIATE THE WHOLE SET OF METHOD ASSERT

IN FACT THIS PACKAGE IS FOR ME A VERY STRONG ASSET FOR PYTHON REGARDING THE OTHER LANGUAGES
YOU DIDN'T SEARCH THAT HARD THEN BEEN USING THAT IN PRODUCTION CLOSE TO A YEAR NOW CLIENT SIDE
YOU SHOULDN'T BE USING A PYTHON HETP SERVER TO SERVE UP YOUR PAGES LOOK INTO DEPLOYING WITH SGI AND A REAL WEB SERVER LIKE NAGING
MOST WEBSITES OUTSIDE OF THE HUGE ONES THAT CAN AFFORD THE PUSH AND NEED IT ARE PERFECTLY FINE FOR THE TIME BEING USING HETP THE OTHER COMMENT IN THIS THREAD POINTS TO A SUITABLE LIBRARY FOR HETP 2 CLIENT AND SERVER SIDE INTERACTION AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A FLASK PLUG IN FOR HETP 2 THAT BEING SAID HETP IS STILL VERY SUITABLE FOR REQUEST RESPONSE TYPES OF WEB APPLICATIONS WHICH MOST APPS ARE LONG POLLING AND VERY RESPONSIVE OR LARGE SCALING APPLICATIONS BENEFIT FROM HETP 2 BUT WILL RESULT IN A VERY SMALL PERFORMANCE INCREASE FOR A HECK OF A LOT OF WORK FOR SMALLER APPS THIS IS ALL RELATING TO CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES FWIW
LOOK INTO SUBPROCESS ALSO R LEARNPYTHON IS A BETTER PLACE FOR QUESTIONS

SNIPY HAS NATIVE LIBRARY DEPENDENCIES FOR BLAS CALPACK AND PROBABLY A BUNCH MORE IT'S POSSIBLE TO BUILD A WHEEL THAT INTERNALIZES THESE DEPENDENCIES BUT THAT WHEEL WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BREAK SHOULD YOUR PYTHON APPLICATION DIRECTLY OR OTHERWISE LINK AGAINST ANY OTHER NATIVE CODE THAT USES THESE LIBRARIES WHICH IS A LIKELY OUTCOME IN A SCIENTIFIC SETTING

AS FOR WHAT BREAK LOOKS LIKE ALL KINDS OF FUN CAN HAPPEN WHEN TWO VERSIONS OF THE SAME LIBRARY GET LOADED ESPECIALLY IF ITS INTERNAL STRUCTURES SOMEHOW GET SHARED ACROSS FUNCTION CALLS INTO THE DISTINCT VERSIONS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS DUPLICATE SYMBOL ERRORS FROM THE RUNTIME LINKER DURING IMPORT ETC


THE USE CONDA ANSWER IS A DECENT ONE IT HANDLES ALL THESE NATIVE ISSUES FOR YOU INCLUDING ENSURING THE SAME THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES ARE LINKED CORRECTLY EVERYWHERE

IS A PERFECTLY FINE TOOL FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO DO I THINK YOU HAVEN'T REALIZED THAT BECAUSE THE NAME OF THE FUNCTION AND ITS ARGUMENTS WERE CHOSEN TO ASSIST THE BRAIN IN GRASPING A PARTICULAR USE CASE

THE FUNCTION ASKS FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE THINGS

A CALLABLE THING THAT TAKES AT LEAST TWO ARGUMENTS AND RETURNS A D ARRAY OF FLOATS THIS IS USUALLY A FUNCTION BUT IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO STICK SOMETHING ELSE IN HERE

AN INPUT TO THE FUNCTION THAT STAYS THE SAME AND WILL ALWAYS BE PASSED AS THE FIRST ARGUMENT

A D ARRAY OF FLOATS WITH THE SAME LENGTH AS THE FUNCTION'S OUTPUT THAT IT WILL TRY TO MATCH

THAT'S IT THOSE ARE THE ONLY RESTRICTIONS

DO YOU SEE HOW YOU CAN DO THIS I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY IF YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING

IN MY EXPERIENCE THE MOST RELIABLE WAY TO DO THIS IS BY USING PYTHON TO CONTROL MS WORD USING WHICHEVER PYIN VERSION IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR INTERPRETER

I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT PROCESS FOR HOW TO USE IT BUT IF I REMEMBER RIGHT YOU IMPORT AND THEN CAN CALL THE FUNCTION ENSUREDISPATCH WHICH RETURNS AN APPLICATION OBJECT CORRESPONDING TO THE WORD OBJECT MODEL

IT'S NOT VERY FUN TO USE BUT SOMETIMES IT'S NECESSARY
I'VE USED FOR GENERATING WORD DOCS IT WORKS AS ADVERTISED BUT DON'T EXPECT A TON OF FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITIES IT ONLY DOES THE BASICS AS FAR AS EXTRACTING I THINK THE MORE YOU KNOW ABOUT XML THE BETTER OFF YOU ARE I DON'T BELIEVE MICROSOFT OFFICE XML SPECS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE SO IT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FIGURING THINGS OUT
SBA FOR ALL IT ANNOYANCES IS SOMETIMES THE SUPERIOR CHOICE ESPECIALLY CASES LIKE THIS

DEALING WITH MS OFFICE FILES CAN BE A REAL PAIN EASIER TO CONVERT THE FILES FIRST IF POSSIBLE XLSX CSF AND DOC TXT

YOU CAN STILL CALL THE MACRO FROM PYTHON IF IT'S BEING INTEGRATED INTO SOMETHING BIGGER

MAYBE IT'S NOT A FEATURE BUT WHEN I REALIZED I COULD ADD FUNCTIONS TO A LIST AND THEN CALL THEM BY REFERENCE AND HAVE AN INSTANT MENU I WAS PRETTY EXCITED
OVERRIDING OPERATORS WITH FOR EXAMPLE ADD SELF OTHER AND THEN JUST ADDING OBJECTS BY USING THE OPERATOR

LATE TO THE PARTY BUT I DISCOVERED SOME SWEET IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF PYTHON BY ACCIDENT NOTES HERE TL R BELOW I MIGHT BE WRONG ON SOME THINGS BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I DISCOVERED THEM BY ACCIDENT
THE KEY ARGUMENT TO MIN AND MAX IS PRETTY USEFUL YOU CAN PASS IT A FUNCTION THAT ACCEPTS ANY ITEM FROM THE PASSED LIST AS ARGUMENT AND RETURNS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE COMPARED LIKE A NUMBER OR A LIST TUPLE FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN FIND THE NAME OF THE PLACE CLOSEST TO A COORDINATE IN A DICT OF PLACE NAMES AND COORDINATES

IMPORT MATH

DEF PT PLACES
DEF KEY PLACE
PLACES PLACE
RETURN PT PT
RETURN KEY

PLACES DICT ZIP ABC 2

CHORD
PRINT PLACE CLOSEST TO IS FORMAT
CHORD MIN PLACES KEY CHORD PLACES

IN OTHER SCENARIOS YOU CAN MAKE USE OF THE FACT THAT BY HAVING YOUR KEY FUNCTION RETURN A TUPLE OF SORTABLE VALUES IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE SO SORT BY THE FIRST ELEMENT OF THE TUPLE FIRST AND IF EQUAL SORT BY THE SECOND ITEM ETC OFTEN TIMES IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND YOU'RE SORTING BY SOME SINGLE VALUE KEY BUT THEN DISCOVER AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE YOU USE AND NEED THIS TO OVERRIDE THE DEFAULT SORTING ORDER SIMPLE JUST RETURN A 2 TUPLE INSTEAD WITH YOUR SINGLE VALUE AS THE SECOND ELEMENT AND AN OVERRIDE VALUE AS THE FIRST

IF YOU NEED THE N SMALLEST VALUES FOR N LARGER THAN USE WITH THE SAME KEY DUNC AS THIS IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN REPEATED USE OF MIN OR USING SORTED N BUT AS N GROWS AT SOME POINT SMALLEST NO LONGER HAS AN ADVANTAGE AND YOU SHOULD JUST PASS YOUR LIST TO SORTED WHICH ALSO TAKES A KEY ARGUMENT TO GET THE WHOLE LIST

SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO GROUP A LIST BY SOME KEY EAST G GROUP A LIST OF PEOPLE BY THEIR HOME ADDRESS OR A LIST OF HOSTNAMES BY THEIR TOP-LEVEL DOMAIN YOU CAN THEN FIRST SORT BY A KEY WHICH LOOKS UP THE ADDRESS OR RETURNS THE LD OR WHATEVER AND THEN PASS THE RESULTING LIST TO WITH THE SAME KEY

LOTS OF GOODIES THERE

THE DIAMOND LIBRARY FUNCTION DIAMOND RETURNS A TUPLE REPRESENTING THE DIVIDEND AND REMAINDER OF AN INTEGER DIVISION OPERATION FOR EXAMPLE

DIAMOND


WHAT DIAMOND DOES IS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE HARDWARE DIVIDE INSTRUCTION DOES AND IT USES A DISTINCTIVELY PYTHON FEATURE WHERE A FUNCTION RETURNS MULTIPLE VALUES IN A TUPLE RUBY HAS A SIMILAR FUNCTION THAT PRODUCES AN ARRAY SO THOSE MAKE IT KIND OF COOL


FOR LARGE NUMBERS DIAMOND IS ACTUALLY FASTER FOR SMALL NUMBERS BECAUSE PYTHON IS HIGH LEVEL AND BECAUSE DIAMOND IS A LIBRARY CALL IT GENERALLY DOESN'T OPTIMIZE DIAMOND ENOUGH TO MAKE IT AS FAST AS DOING BOTH THE INTEGER DIVIDE AND MODULO DIVIDE OPERATION

THIS STACKOVERFLOW SHOWS HOW TO TIME OPERATIONS USING TIMET AND HOW TO OPTIMIZE A LIBRARY FUNCTION CALL BY USING A LOCAL VARIABLE IT COMPARES DIAMOND CALLS WITH THE OPERATION CALLS

JUST CD TO THE ROOT FOLDER AND GO

WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC THINGS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THERE IS PROBABLY ANOTHER LIBRARY YOU CAN USE
REPUBLICAN SURGEON S WARNING REDDIN MAKES YOU DUMB AND HAS BEEN MEASURED AS MORE EFFECTUAL THAN SOY PRODUCTS AT GIVING YOU A SMALL WIENER


THIS IS SOME GRADE A SPAM SITE

TAKE THIS WITH ABOUT HALF A GRAIN OF SALT
WHO IS SUPPOSED TO CARE REPORTING AS SPAM
UPDATE

MANAGED TO INCREASE ACCURACY BY ALMOST WHEN I ADDED DARKER PIXELS AROUND THE LETTERS

THE PROBLEM IS WITH AND AND TESSERACT SEEMS TO MESS THIS UP QUITE A BIT
FROM PAST EXPERIENCE TESSERACT WORKS BETTER ON BIGGER IMAGES SO UPSCALE THE IMAGE BY EAST G YOU CAN ALSO TRY VARIANT IMAGES WHERE YOU DO DIFFERENT THRESHOLDING AFTER BLURRING THIS IS A VERY MANUAL DISCOVERY PROCESS BUT IF YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS FOR A SAMPLE YOU COULD THE PROCESS

SINCE YOU HAVE SEGMENTED INDIVIDUAL LETTERS YOU ALSO LOOK AT MACHINE LEARNING THERE'S A LARGE LITERATURE ON RECOGNISING SINGLE DIGITS USING MACHINE LEARNING FROM NAIVE BAYES THROUGH TO DEEP BELIEF NETWORKS BUT I SUSPECT YOU'LL GET QUITE A LONG WAY JUST WITH TESSERACT

HOPE THAT HELPS IAN
TENSORFLOW
INSTALL BUMPY
ARE YOU USING PYTHON STANDALONE OR THE CONSOLE PROVIDED IN ARIMASP OR DESKTOP PRO LEFT OFF AT

AS SUGGESTED BY U ELIOT MAKE SURE ALL DEPENDENCIES ARE LOADED BE SURE THAT YOUR INSTALLATION IS POINTING TO THE CORRECT DIRECTORIES
IN MY EXPERIENCE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PROTOTYPES BECOME PRODUCTION CODE PRETTY OFTEN FOR ME OF THE TIME AS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE

THE ONLY REAL FACTOR OF WHETHER YOU REWRITE YOUR CODE WITH A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE COMES FROM ONE OF A FEW POSSIBLE AVENUES

CTO OR SIMILAR DECIDES ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS PERFORMANCE SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT IN WHATEVER IS MOST PERFORMANT
2 CTO OR SIMILAR DECIDES THEY PREFER LANGUAGE ECOSYSTEM X OVER Y SO YOU DO IT IN X
YOU MEASURE AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THE PERFORMANCE IS IMPACTED EVALUATE IF IT IS SOMETHING RELATED TO CODE AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SOMETHING FIXABLE AND START FROM DETERMINING IF PYTHON CAN DO WHAT YOU NEED OR IF YOU NEED A CHANGE IN MANY CASES THE BOTTLENECK ISN'T THE CODE IT'S WAITING ON SOMETHING ELSE DB EXTERNAL SERVICE ETC

SO TO YOUR INITIAL STATEMENT YES PYTHON IS EXCELLENT FOR QUICK MVP AND PROTOTYPES I WOULD EXTEND THAT TO QUICK APPLICATIONS PYTHON OPTIMIZES FOR DEVELOPER TIME WHICH IS NOT CHEAP GENERALLY AND REFUSING TO GUESS IN THE FACE OF AMBIGUITY SEE ZEN OF PYTHON

IT'S NOT THE ANSWER TO EVERY PROBLEM BUT IT CAN GENERALLY SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM THERE ARE A FEW CASES WHERE YOU'D BE BETTER SERVED BY DROPPING INTO C OR USING A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THAT DOES DEFINITELY HAPPEN BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE TO DATE THAT IS THE EXCEPTION NOT THE RULE
YOU'RE RIGHT PYTHON IS EXCELLENT TO BUILD MVP AND PROTOTYPES

NOW I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD EVENTUALLY SWITCH TO ANOTHER LANGUAGE
LINK SHOULD BE NO SS

I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH COCONUT
WHO USES COCONUT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT
WHEN I TRIED IT DEBUGGING WAS STRAIGHTFORWARD BECAUSE IT IS INTEGRATED WITH PYTHON JUPITER STILL WANT TO USE IT MORE
A BIT OF RAMBLING THOUGHTS FROM TRYING IT OUT ON SOME SMALL PROJECTS PERSONAL THINGS

YOU NEED TO HAVE A SEPARATE BUILD DIR IF YOU MIX COCO AND PY FILES SINCE BECOMES YOU'LL HAVE AN UNFUR TIME GITIGNORING ONE AND NOT THE OTHER


ERROR MESSAGES ARE A BIT JUNKY SINCE YOU HAVE COCO COMPILING TO A MASSIVE PILE OF CUSTOM CLASSES FUNCTIONS DECORATORS ETC AND YOUR EQUIVALENT PY CODE SO SOMETHING SIMPLE COULD QUITE EASILY GO THROUGH SEVERAL LAYERS OF INDIRECTION MEANING A QUITE USELESS TRACEBACK

I WISH APPROACH WAS TAKEN WHERE YOU CAN USE A KOCHI MODULE LOADER TO COMPILE AND RUN COCO FILES ON IMPORT INSTEAD OF THE WEIRD COMPILE STEP AND THEN JUST HAVE A PY COCO TO MANAGE THAT

I DO KNOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO RUN WITHOUT COMPILING THOUGH I LOOKED CLOSELY AT IT THERE MAY BE A MODULE LOADER BUT I LOOKED TO CLOSELY AT THAT EITHER ADMITTEDLY

THE LANGUAGE IS QUITE NICE I DO WANT TO DO MORE OF IT
INSTALL ANACONDA HTTPS TO GET ALL THE DATA ANALYTICS PACKAGES YOU NEED TO START THEN RUN SNYDER FROM THERE THAT SHOULD GET YOU STARTED

I STARTED WITH STUDIO AND THIS WAS MY PREFERRED PYTHON EQUIVALENT I HAD TOO MANY PROBLEMS USING RODEO WHERE CHANGES I MADE WERE NOT SAVED BACK TO THE FILE SNYDER WAS SLOW BUT SEEMS VASTLY IMPROVED
HOW ABOUT
IT MAY BE WORTH TRYING PYDEV ALONG WITH ITS INTERACTIVE CONSOLE

YOU CAN USE AN EDITOR TO TYPE THE CODE AND USE TO SEND THINGS LINE BY LINE TO A CONSOLE AFTERWARDS OR CTRL ALT ENTER TO RUN THE FILE IN THE CONSOLE AND MAKE ALL SYMBOLS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR CURRENT FILE AND THEN WORK INTERACTIVELY

ALSO YOU CAN HAVE A DEBUGGER VIEW CONNECTED TO THE CONSOLE

THIS WAY YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE IDE FEATURES YOU EXPECT SUCH AS GO TO DEFINITION BROWSE THROUGH ALL SYMBOLS AVAILABLE CTRL SHIFT T FIND REFERENCES CTRL SHIFT G ETC WHILE STILL HAVING AN INTERACTIVE CONSOLE INTEGRATION

IF YOU GO THAT ROUTE MAKE SURE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT TO CONFIGURE THINGS PROPERLY

CAN'T HURT TRYING
I THINK U SWINGEING WAS SPOT ON WHEN S HE SAID TO FIND A PROJECT THAT CAPTURES YOUR INTEREST YOU'LL BE USING THE LANGUAGE AND NOT JUST FOLLOWING A TUTORIAL

BUT ONCE YOU HAVE A FEEL FOR THE SYNTAX I CAN'T RECOMMEND STRONGLY ENOUGH THAT YOU LOOK UP PRESENTATIONS AND WRITING BY RAYMOND HETTINGER AND DAVID BEAZLEY

IF YOU LEARN BEST BY READING BEFORE DOING MARK LEARNING PYTHON SEEMS INTIMIDATING BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE BUT IT'S SO BIG BECAUSE IT IS BOTH COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR BEGINNERS SO DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW YOU CAN SKIP LARGE PARTS BUT IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING IN THAT BOOK YOU ARE WELL ON YOUR WAY TO BEING AN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL PYTHON DEV
HI I'M THE AUTHOR OF AUTOMATE THE BEST NEXT STEPS FOR ANY LANGUAGE ARE GETTING FAMILIAR WITH THE STANDARD LIBRARY AND DOING PROJECTS I RECOMMEND DOUG PYTHON MODEL OF THE WEEK BLOG AND THE PYTHON COOKBOOK BOOK

FOR PROJECTS YOU CAN WORK ON YOUR OWN OR TRY TACKLING THE PROBLEMS ON I LIKE IT BETTER THAN PROJECT EULER
WHAT ELSE WOULD I NEED

A PROJECT THAT CAPTURES YOUR INTEREST I'VE MADE SO MANY WEIRD DIFFERENT AUTOMATION PROGRAMS WITH PYTHON THAT IT'S REALLY HELPED ME EXPLORE DIFFERENT FACETS OF PYTHON AND IT'S MADE THE PROCESS REALLY ENJOYABLE

IS DEFINITELY THE RIGHT CHOICE I HAVE SOME LEGACY CODE THAT I MAINTAIN BUT FOR ANY NEW PROJECTS IT'S ALL FROM HERE ON AFTER LEARNING LANGUAGE AND OO BASICS PICK UP A WEB FRAMEWORK LIKE FLASK YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF USING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN OH COMING FROM JAVA BACKGROUND TAKE CARE NOT TO REPLICATE JAVA THINKING TO YOUR PYTHON SEE THIS POST
JUST WRITE STUFF YO YOU CAN READ ALL THE BOOKS IN THE WORLD BUT IF YOU NEVER WRITE ANYTHING YOU'RE NEVER GONNA PROGRESS
I THINK AUTOMATE WOULD BE ALL YOU NEED TO START
FLUENT PYTHON IS A GREAT BOOK TO LEARN PYTHON A LOT ADVANCED TOPICS EXPLAINED VERY NICE IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PYTHON BOOKS
YOU CAN USE CRON TO DO THIS



CRONTAB E
JUST A HEADS UP I'VE BEEN TINKERING AROUND WITH GPC AND DECIDED TO CREATE A SPECIFIC SUBREDDIT FOR IT SOME POINTS ON THAT

IT'S NOT PYTHON SPECIFIC BUT HAS PYTHON BINDINGS AND PYTHON SEEMS TO BE A POPULAR LANGUAGE USED WITH IT

2 I'VE USE RPC PYRO XMLRPC AND OTHER RPC FRAMEWORKS APPROACHES WITH PYTHON GPC JUST FEELS RIGHT TO ME ESPECIALLY IN THAT IT'S AND

MY MAIN MOTIVATION FOR CREATING THIS SUBREDDIT IS THAT GPC IS COMPLICATED ENOUGH BUT SERIOUSLY LACKING IN GOOD DOCUMENTATION AND MORE SPECIFICALLY CONCRETE EXAMPLES ACTUALLY IT REMINDS ME OF ASYNCIO IN THAT REGARD ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MORE ASYNCIO EXAMPLES ONLINE NOW

THAT'S IT CHECK IT OUT LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
THERE'S A PYTHON REPOSITORY IN GITHUB THAT CAN BE A GOOD START BUT EVENTUALLY I OPTED FOR THE MORE OFFICIAL WAY AND DOWNLOADED THE SOURCE CODE FROM THE FOUNDATION DOWNLOADS PAGE SO THAT I COULD COMFORTABLY EXPLORE IT WITH MY TEXT EDITOR

THERE'S A LINK TO THE SOURCE CODE OF EACH MODULE AT THE TOP OF THE DOCUMENTATION THE SOURCE IS OFFICIALLY HOSTED ON NOT GITHUB

ROLE RANDING LEN ROLE

YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE A SPIN
INSTEAD OF PRINT TEXT VARIABLE TEXT YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO EITHER AN ACTUAL TEMPLATING LANGUAGE LIKE JINJA 2 AS OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED OR PYTHONS BUILT IN FORMAT STRINGS LIKE PRINT TEXT TEXT FORMAT VARIABLE

ON THE SURFACE THAT DOESN'T LOOK MUCH BETTER OF COURSE BUT YOU CAN EXPAND IT AS SO PRINT TEXT TEXT FORMAT VARIABLE

SO YOU CAN MORE EASILY ALTER THE BASIC TEMPLATE WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING TO THE ARGUMENTS TO THE FORMAT CALL

TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER AND DEFINE THE TEMPLATE ON ONE LINE AND CALL FORMAT ON ANOTHER



A SOMETHING PLAYED BY THAT ONE ACTOR WHO IS IN EVERY MOVIE DECIDES TO IN 2 THERE SHE MEETS AND FALLS MADLY IN LOVE

NOW YOU CAN ALTER THE TEMPLATE WITHOUT ANY WORRY ABOUT THE ORDER OF THE ARGUMENTS AND YOU GET THE BENEFIT OF FIELDS HAVING MEANINGFUL NAMES THAT ARE A LOT EASIER TO KEEP TRACK OF THAN A BUNCH OF INDICES
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT PROJECT FOR YOU TO TRY OUT A TEMPLATING ENGINE LIKE JINJA THAT LETS YOU EASILY EDIT THE TEXT WITHOUT HAVING TO MIX IT UP WITH CODE
GOING TO FIRE OFF A COUPLE OF THESE TO MY SIGOTHER AND SEE IF SHE'D BE INTERESTED IN WATCHING THEM
FUN PROJECT IF YOU WANTED TO BUILD ON IT YOU COULD TRY ALLOWING THE USER TO ENTER SOME NEW OPTIONS LIKE MADLIBS
ERSH THIS HITS HOME I THINK YOU NEED AN AVERAGE CHRISTMAS PER MINUTE RANDOM INT TOO SINCE IT SEEMS LIKE HALLMARK REQUIRES MOVIES MENTION THE AT LEAST TWICE A MINUTE I SWEAR YOU'D THINK THE DIRECTOR IS AFRAID VIEWERS WILL FORGET IT'S A CHRISTMAS MOVIE UNLESS LITERALLY EVERY MOMENT IS PADDED WITH IT

HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW EVERY SINGLE MOVIE'S SOUNDTRACK IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT IS EXACTLY THE SAME IT'S LIKE THEY BOUGHT THE LICENSE FOR A HANDFUL OF REACTION TRACKS SURPRISE CLIMAX SADNESS MAJOR PLOT POINT ETC AND NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE
I DID A SIMILAR PROJECT A FEW YEARS AGO FOR GENERATING TITLES I WAS NEVER ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS WHICH IS WHY IT'S STILL VERSION BUT IT WAS A FUN PROJECT NONETHELESS



THE SOURCE CODE CAN BE FOUND HERE

IT SEEMS THAT PERFECTION IS ATTAINED NOT WHEN THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO ADD BUT WHEN THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO REMOVE

ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPÉRY

EVERY CODE YOU ADD TO THE STANDARD LIBRARY IS CODE YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN AT SOME POINT YOU RISK SPENDING MORE TIME MAINTAINING EXISTING CODE BUGFIXES ETC THAN ADDING NEW FUNCTIONALITY TO THE LANGUAGE

ALSO WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE IF THERE'S A FUNCTION TO CHOOSE BY WEIGHTED VALUES HOW ABOUT CHOOSING FROM GAUSSIAN OR POISSON DISTRIBUTIONS HOW ABOUT ADDING SOME RANDOMNESS TESTS TO THE LIBRARY AS WELL

FURTHERMORE SINCE IT'S THE STANDARD LIBRARY YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE MANY CHANGES TO THE API SO IF SOME BAD DECISIONS WERE MADE YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH STUCK WITH THEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME SEE PYTHON WHICH WAS DESIGNED AS A ONE-TIME THING TO FIX SOME BAD DECISIONS THAT COULDN'T BE CHANGED WITHOUT REMOVING BACKWARDS COMPARABILITY AND HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR PEOPLE TO USE IT IT'S MUCH BETTER TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THE LIBRARY AND LET THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES HANDLE THE SPECIAL CASES
THEY ALREADY INCLUDED A TON OF FEATURES IN THE STDLIB RANDOM MODULE THAT A LOT OF STANDARD LIBRARIES DON'T BOTHER WITH

IT'S ALREADY PRETTY FULL FEATURED I'VE HAD TO DO WEIGHTED CHOICE MYSELF BUT IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY EASY TO DO SO I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM LOOK INTO ANY MARKOV CHAIN LIBRARY AND IT'LL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT SOME VERSION OF IT

IF YOU WANT AN INEFFICIENT BUT SUPER SIMPLE WAY OF DOING A WEIGHTED CHOICE USING POSITIVE INTEGERS TRY THIS

IMPORT RANDOM
WEIGHTED ALPHA BETA GAMMA DELTA
PRINT WEIGHTED

BAM WEIGHTED CHOICE IF YOU NEED THE REAL THING WITH FLOATING POINTS IT'S PRETTY EASY TO DO AGAIN MARKOV CHAIN IMPLEMENTATIONS
IN PYTHON 2 USE INSTEAD OF INPUT

2 TITLES ARE NOT A GOOD IDEA

POST QUESTIONS IN R LEARNPYTHON
FUCKING BOOBS
COMPARED TO WEB HOW HARD FRUSTRATING WAS IT AND HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THE RESULTS IN TERMS OF POTENTIALITIES

PS FOR MAKING STYLE A LITTLE LESS FOR EVERY WIDGET YOU CAN USE A PREES THAT IS A DICT WITH YOUR PREFERED STUFF LIKE BG COLORS AND AL CF THIS GIST FOR AN EXAMPLE
SEARCH FOR PREF
PPS I AM THE TROLL WHO WROTE SO I AM CURIOUS TO SEE IF I WAS THE ONLY ONE PLEASED WITH GOING BACK TO TK


YOU NEED JAVASCRIPT FOR THAT
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FLASK YOU PROBABLY WANT EITHER SELENIUM FOR AUTOMATING A WEB BROWSER ON THE PC YOUR PYTHON CODE IS EXECUTING ON OR JS FOR OPENING TABS ON CLIENTS THAT VISIT YOUR FLASK SITE JS HAS RESTRICTIONS ON HOW IT CAN INTERACT WITH OTHER TABS FOR ANNOYANCE SECURITY REASONS
DEPENDS WHAT YOU'RE AFTER REALLY YOU CAN MAKE A LINK WHICH OPENS IN A NEW TAB BY USING

A HRE TARGET BLANK

BUT AS FOR CONTROLLING WHAT HAPPENS THERE THAT WOULD BE A JOB FOR SELENIUM UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING ON THE CLIENT SIDE WHICH I DOUBT IS POSSIBLE AND I EXPECT THERE ARE GOOD REASONS WHY
YES THERE IS AN INCLUDED BATTERY THAT DOES EXACTLY THAT

YOU CAN SEE IT IN ACTION IF YOU WRITE IMPORT ANTIGRAVITY AWESOME EASTER EGG

YOU CAN'T CLOSE IT THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO WITH IT IS TO MAKE IT GO TO ANOTHER LINK

LIBRARY
IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY I NEED TO HAVE THIS SCRIPT IN THE PATH WITH THE DFS I WANT TO MERGE

THAT DOESN'T SEEM TOO SLICK I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PASS A TARGET DIRECTORY

ALSO IT LOOKS LIKE FILENAME CONVENTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO DO THE MERGE DO I HAVE TO RENAME ANY FILE I WANT TO SOMETHING THE TOOL WILL UNDERSTAND THAT SEEMS UNWIELDY

LASTLY IT'S NICE THAT YOU INCLUDED TEST DFS BUT THOSE ARE PROBABLY BETTER SUITED IN A TESTS DIRECTORY
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU NEED DEEP NEURAL NETS JUST BASIC ML ALGORITHMS USE SCI KIT LEARN
I FOUND IT PRETTY FAST EASY TO USE THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS IN
I'VE FOUND LASAGNE ON UBUNTU TO BE THE EASIEST TO SET UP AND USE
I AM USING TENSORFLOW MYSELF DUE TO THE VERSATILITY THAT THE LIBRARY OFFERS AND PARTIALLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT'S POPULARITY GIVES ME ACCESS TO TONS OF RESOURCES ONLINE YOU MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED IN THE VERSATILITY ASPECT OF THE LANGUAGE YET THE ONLINE TUTORIALS SHOULD GET YOU COVERED AS FAR AS LEARNING THE LIBRARY IS CONCERNED
I FOUND CERAS TO BE SUPER SIMPLE AND FUN BUT YOUR PROBLEM RATHER SOUNDS LIKE LINEAR REGRESSION FOR THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PACKAGE
I HAVEN'T USED ANY BUT I'D USE TENSORFLOW THE INTERFACE SEEMS VERY SIMPLE AND THERE'S PLENTY OFFICIAL TUTORIALS WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE DATA SETS UP ON YOUTUBE
IF YOU ARE RUNNING LINUX I THINK TENSORFLOW WILL GIVE YOU THE MOST DEPTH
I DON'T USE EITHER JUST SYNTACTIC
I USE AND PREDICTION

I THINK IT'S STILL USABLE AND I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT

I WOULD RECOMMEND IT

THE DEFAULTS ARE A BIT TOO MUCH FOR ME I DISABLED SOME STUFF LIKE ROPE FOR EXAMPLE

DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS NO LONGER MAINTAINED HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY WILL PICK IT UP IN THE FUTURE
TL R I WOULD SAY TRY PICK WHAT YOU LIKE AND SETUP YOUR OWN CONFIT DON'T BUY INTO THE FULL THING AS IT WILL SLOW VIM DOWN CONSIDERABLY



IS AN OPINIONATED SET OF PLUGGING RELATED TO PYTHON WHILE JUST EXPOSES THE JEDI LIBRARY TO VIM AKA AUTOCOMPLETE

IS PERHAPS THE EASIEST WAY TO GET STARTED WHEN YOU DON'T HEALY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR BUT ITS LACK OF GRANULARITY AND MAINTENANCE MAKES IT VERY SLOW ON PROJECTS AND AFTER A WHILE YOU WILL MOST LIKELY MOVE TO A MORE CUSTOM GRANULAR CONFIGURATION
I USED TO USED FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS PRETTY NICE BUT I KEPT RUNNING INTO PERFORMANCE ISSUES ESPECIALLY WHEN WORKING ON LARGE PROJECTS HAD TO KEEP TWEAKING THE SETTINGS I THINK I HAD TO DISABLE ROPE AND SOME OTHER STUFF TO PREVENT FREEZES THINK I ALSO HAD TO DISABLE SOME FOLDING FEATURE FOR PERF ISSUES AND USE INSTEAD

FOR COMPLETION I USED TO USE YOUCOMPLETEME WHICH WORKED NICELY THOUGH YOU HAD TO KEEP RECOMPILING LIBS WHEN AN UPDATE WAS ROLLED OUT

I THINK THERE ARE ALSO ISSUES WHERE YOU CAN'T HAVE AND SIDE-BY-SIDE NOT SURE IF ISSUES ARE RESOLVED IE IF YOU WANTED MOST OF PYTHON MODE FEATURES BUT WANTED TO USE FOR COMPLETION ETC

FOR CLINTING AND ALL SYNTACTIC WORKS WELL I THINK I DISABLED CLINTING AND ENABLED CLINTING IN SYNTACTIC

AT SOME POINT I THINK I JUST DISABLED ALTOGETHER ALL I MISSED WERE THE CONVENIENT MOTIONS TO SELECT CHANGE DELETE METHODS AND CLASSES CIM DAM VIC DAC ETC ETC

I'M CURRENTLY REDOING MY VIM SETUP I'M USING NERVISM NOW USING NEOMAKE FOR ASYNC CLINTING

FOR COMPLETION I'M USING DEPLETE ALONG WITH I HAD TO INSTALL AS WELL TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE FEATURE DISABLED COMPLETION IN SINCE THAT IS HANDLED BY
I USED BUT IT'S NOT UPDATED FROM JANUARY THE ISSUES ARE NOT RESOLVED AND IN THE GITHUB SITE YOU CAN READ THAT THE AUTHOR DON'T HAVE TIME TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES WAS A TOO-MUCH PUGIN WITH MANY SETTINGS THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITH OTHER PLUGGING AND SETTINGS THE AUTOCOMPLETE USED ROPE AND WAS CUMBERSOME WITH VIRTUALENVS SO I SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL OPTIONS AND INSTEAD OF I CHOOSE YOUCOMPLETEME THAT USE JEDI FOR PYTHON AUTOCOMPLETION I COMPLEMENT WITH SUPERTAX TO ADD ULTISNIPS TOO AND SOME TIME I LEAVE AND IMPLEMENTED SOME SETTINGS FOR PYTHON FILETYPE AUTOINDENT SMARTTABS AND TABSTOPS SETTINGS

SOME WEEKS AGO I BEGIN TO USE NERVISM AND FOR THIS I CHANGED YOUCOMPLETEME AND ULTISNIPS WITH DEPLETE NEOSNIPPETS AND NEOMAKE MY ACTUAL SETTINGS ARE PUBLISHED HERE

SNIPPETS

WHY NOT BOTH I USE JEDI FOR AUTOCOMPLETE AND THEN TURN OFF PRETTY MUCH EVERY FEATURE IN EXCEPT ROPE REFRACTURING TOOLS
AND VIMCOMPLETESME FOR AUTOCOMPLETION

ROPEVIM FOR REFRACTURING

A FLAKE COMPILER PUGIN FOR BUILDING

GUTENTAGS AND UNIVERSAL CLAGS FOR BUILDING TAGS
THIS BETTER BE FOCUSING ON PYTHON AND NOT THE OUTDATED PYTHON 2

THE LONGER WE KEEP PYTHON 2 ALIVE THE SLOWER THE PYTHON COMMUNITY EVOLVE BECAUSE OF THE DIVIDE

ITS TIME TO MOVE ON FOLKS



NOPE IT'S JUST SUPPORTS PYTHON 2
WHATEVER

JUST FOR GIGGLES I HOPE THEY'LL BREAK PYTHON AND HAVE THE GIL REMOVED
PISTON IS TOUTED AS A HIGH PERFORMANCE JIT FOR PYTHON BUT IT SEEMS LIKE PIPY OUT PERFORMS PISTON I AM CURIOUS ABOUT WHETHER PISTON ULTIMATELY HAS MORE LEGROOM TO RUN THAN PIPY IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU WANT A JIT YOU SHOULD CHOOSE PIPY OVER PISTON WHAT AM I MISSING
INVESTMENT INTO A NEW PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION IS REALLY GREAT IT REALLY PUSHES THE WHOLE PYTHON ECOSYSTEM FORWARD WE NEEDED A COMPANY LIKE THEM TO FINALLY DO THAT

TL R

BOTH PYTHON AND R HAVE GREAT PACKAGES TO MAINTAIN SOME KIND OF PARITY WITH THE OTHER REGARDLESS OF THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FLEXIBLE EXTENSIBLE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT ALSO EXCELS IN BOTH MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA ANALYSIS PYTHON IS THE CLEAR CHOICE
NOT TO MENTION MAJOR DIFFERENCES IN THE CULTURE OF DOCUMENTATION

IN PYTHON YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND A WEBSITE WITH IMAGES OR AN INTERACTIVE NOTEBOOK

IN R YOU'LL GET A PAGE PDF WITHOUT GRAPHIC EXAMPLES

I DO DATA VISUALIZATION AND USE BOTH R AND PYTHON REGULARLY WITH A STRONG PREFERENCE FOR THE LATTER THE NUMBER OF R PACKAGES FOR GRAPHICS THAT ARE ONE HUNDRED PAGES WITHOUT A SINGLE EXAMPLE OF SAID GRAPHICS IS RIDICULOUS IT'S LIKE DOCUMENTATION IS MAINTAINED BY AN ACADEMIC WHO HASN'T BEEN TOLD THOSE DFS DON'T COUNT DURING TENURE REVIEW
THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST IS R'S CODING STYLE I GUESS IT'S MORE OF A PERSONAL PREFERENCE BUT I JUST CANNOT GET OVER IT
SHINY IS STILL THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET REALLY NICE DASHBOARDS UP AND RUNNING ALSO R HAS QUITE A BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH MISSING DATA THAN SCI KIT LEARN

ONE PLACE WHERE I AM NOW FINDING A LOT OF GOOD USE FOR PYTHON THOUGH IS WITH REDSHIFT YOU CANNSCALE PYTHON DFS TO A LOT OF DATA
PYTHON FOR SURE IT BLENDS INTO APPLICATION STACKS MUCH EASIER THAN ROYAL
PYTHON IS ALSO MY CHOICE FOR DATA ANALYSIS
R'S STRENGTH INCLUDES GIGLOT 2 AND STATS MODELING

PORT OF GIGLOT 2 IS PROMISING IMO PEOPLE OUGHT TO USE GIGLOT 2 RATHER THAN SEABORN ETC

STATMODELS NEED TO HAVE BETTER DOCUMENTATION AND MANY MORE THINGS TO APPROACH R'S STATISTICAL MODELING
I LOVE PYTHON BUT DISAGREE THE TIDYVERSE AND SHINY HAVE PUT R WAY AHEAD AS A DATA LANGUAGE
I THINK IT'S KIND OF A SILLY QUESTION SORT OF LIKE PYTHON VERSUS R FOR NETWORKING BOTH DO IT TONS OF LANGUAGES DO IT I KNOW GUYS WHO'VE DONE ML AND DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON SCALA R LUA CUDA TORCH THEY ALL HAVE GREAT LIBRARIES

IT'S NOT WHAT LANGUAGE YOU USE IT'S HOW YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM THE HARD PART IS DEFINITELY NOT WORKING WITH THE LANGUAGE OR WHAT LOOKS THE CLEANEST
IMO PYTHON IS WAY BETTER THA R IF YOU PLAN TO DO DATA MING FOR A LONG TIME
LET ME TRY

PYTHON R

BASIC ML PACKAGES
DEEP ML PACKAGES¹² AND MXNET³ MXNET³
BAYESIAN INFERENCE PMC PACKAGES
BASIC PLOTTING MATPLOTLIB BUILT-IN
NICER PLOTTING MATPLOTLIB SEABORN GIGLOT 2

I AND DIFFERENT APIS

I GOOD LUCK GETTING EVERYTHING INSTALLED AND RUNNING ON GPU IF YOU'RE ON WINDOWS

I ALSO AVAILABLE FOR PYTHON R SCALA JULIA AND OF COURSE C PROBABLY THE EASIEST DEEPML LIBRARY TO INSTALL AND GET RUNNING
MIXED EFFECTS LOGISTIC REGRESSION IS THE BIGGEST MISSING PIECE IN PYTHON FOR ME SO I DO ALMOST EVERYTHING IN PYTHON BUT MOST OF MY REGRESSIONS AND RELATED PLOTTING IN ROYAL NOT THE WORST STATUS QUO
AS SOMEONE WHO USES BOTH FOR DATA SCIENCE THINGS I THINK THE DISCUSSION SHOULD BE LESS PYTHON VS R AND MORE HOW CAN I LEVERAGE BOTH OF THESE TO MY BEST ADVANTAGE

UNEQUIVOCALLY PYTHON HAS ADVANTAGES LIKE BEING FASTER BEING ABLE TO NEATLY FIT INTO APPLICATIONS WEB TECH STACKS A LOT EASIER AND IT'S GOT A HUGE VARIETY OF GREAT LIBRARIES AND THEY'RE OFTEN PUT TOGETHER A LOT MORE RIGOROUSLY

HOWEVER I'VE FOUND THAT R'S ADVANTAGE DUE TO ITS ACADEMIC BACKGROUND IS THAT THERE ARE MORE IMPLANTATION OF NEW AND CUTTING EDGE STUFF ALSO TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE AREN'T ANY GOOD LIBRARIES FOR THINGS LIKE ASSOCIATION RULE MINING IN PYTHON AND THE SKLEARN TEAM REFUSE TO IMPLEMENT IT WHEREAS THERE IS WITH ROYAL I ALSO FIND THAT GETTING REGRESSION MODELS OFF THE GROUND IS A LOT EASIER AND FASTER WITH R DUE TO ITS INSANELY STRAIGHTFORWARD PLOTTING AND HOW MANY MODELLING PACKAGES WILL USUALLY PROVIDE A FULL SET OF DIAGNOSTIC GRAPHS ETC

I USUALLY HARVEST MY DATA IN PYTHON TRY AND DO INITIAL EXPLORATION AND CLEANING IN R REPLICATE THE CLEANING PREPROCESSING THAT WORKED HELPED IN PYTHON TRY SOME MODELS IN R AND PYTHON DEPENDING ON WHAT I WANT TO DO REFINE MODELS FIGURE OUT THE PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL SET OF PREPROCESSING CLEANING MODELLING AND PLOTTING AND ROLL THAT OUT IN ONE NEAT SCRIPT PIPELINE
I DO ANALYSIS AT WORK ALL THE TIME WE SET UP API SERVERS FOR STREAMING DATA ANALYSIS THE THOUGHT OF DOING THAT IN R MAKES ME SHUDDER R MIGHT HAVE THE BETTER ECOSYSTEM WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUAL STATS BUT THE REST OF PYTHONS ECOSYSTEM IS FAR BETTER NETWORKING ETC AND MAKES COMMON PROGRAMMING TASKS SET UP AN API GIVE USERS QUOTA ETC SO MUCH EASIER
IF YOU'RE AN EXPERIENCED PYTHON OR REALLY ANY STANDARD SYSTEM OR SCRIPTING LANGUAGE DEVELOPER YOU'RE ALMOST ALWAYS GOING TO PREFER PYTHON OVER R IT'S MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT YOU ARE USED TO

HOWEVER IF YOU ARE FROM A STEM FIELD THAT DOESN'T TEACH PROGRAMMING AND INSTEAD USES R OR BPSS OR SOME OTHER STATS BASED LANGUAGE YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BOTHER PUTTING IN THE TIME TO LEARN PYTHON UNLESS SOMEONE PAYS YOU TO LEARN IT AND EVEN THEN YOU'LL PROBABLY STILL PREFER ROYAL

R IS A SPECIALIST LANGUAGE AND AS SUCH IT TENDS TO GET THE CUTTING EDGE STUFF FROM ACADEMIA FASTER THAN PYTHON OFTEN AN R PACKAGE FOR A NEW ALGORITHM WILL BE RELEASED ALONGSIDE THE PAPER TO ENCOURAGE USE BUT THE PYTHON DATA COMMUNITY HAS BECOME EXTREMELY GOOD AT PORTING THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE R COMMUNITY TO PYTHON THAT'S WHY WE HAVE LIBRARIES LIKE PANDAS

THE ARTICLE IS A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF BOTH BUT I THINK THIS IS THE KEY QUOTE FROM THE CONCLUSION THERE ARE SO MANY DISTRIBUTIONS MODULES IDES AND ALGORITHMS FOR EACH THAT YOU REALLY CAN'T GO WRONG WITH EITHER IN OTHER WORDS FOLLOW YOUR BLISS

PERSONALLY I KNOW AND USE BOTH WITH THE DECISION RESTING ON WHAT I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACHIEVE A WEB BASED DASHBOARD PYTHON QUICK DATA CLEANING AND EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS ROYAL

R WASN'T CREATED TO REPLACE OR REPLICATE WHAT PYTHON ALREADY DOES STATS AND GRAPHS CREATED BY BIOLOGY STUDENTS I THINK THAT'S WHY COUNTING STARTS FROM ONE AND NOT ZERO
I LEARNED ABOUT PANDAS MAYBE A YEAR AFTER LEARNING R AND PREFERRED IT UNTIL PANDAS BECAME INSANELY OVERUSED AND OVER RELIED ON TO DO DATA ANALYSIS PLUS PANDAS IS SUPER SLOW
YES YOU MIGHT WANT TO INVESTIGATE I'VE WORKED ON LARGE COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS WHICH INTEGRATE PYTHON AND C CODE BASES USING IT HAS A STEEP LEARNING CURVE BUT IS VERY POWERFUL
YES LOOK INTO COTYPES IN THE STANDARD LIBRARY OR CFF
I WOULD CONSIDER WRAPPING IT IN COTHON
AVOID SWIG LIKE THE PLAGUE
I HAVE A SORT OF SKELETON REPOSITORY DOING THIS SORT OF THING HERE DIRECTLY USING THE C C API I PERSONALLY FIND IT EASIER TO USE THAT DIRECTLY THAN TO USE BOOST PYTHON POYBIRD SWIG COTYPES THOUGH YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY CHECK THAT OUT TOO SINCE MAYBE THAT'S YOUR THING IT'S WRITTEN FOR PYTHON ONLY EVER TESTED IT ON UBUNTU AND CEBIAN AND IT'S NOT WELL DOCUMENTED BUT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL AT LEAST I PERSONALLY LIKE TO HAVE CODE AS GUIDES

APPROXIMATEIDENTITY MODULE

BASICALLY THE WAY YOU USE THAT IS THE FOLLOWING

CLONE REPO TO MODULE FOLDER WELL ANYWHERE BUT I'LL REFER TO THE FOLDER LOCATION LIKE THAT
2 GO INTO MODULE CPP AND RUN MAKE THIS WILL COMPILE A C SHARED LIBRARY
NEXT SET PATHS EXPORT MODULE CPP EXPORT MODULE CPP AND EXPORT CATH MODULE CPP INCLUDE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE TO SET THESE TO THE PATHS AND NOT RELATIVE
GO INTO MODULE AND CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT VIRTUALENV ENV AND THEN EXECUTE SOURCE ENV BIN ACTIVATE
FINAL RUN MAKE INSIDE THE MODULE FOLDER

AFTER THIS HAS ALL BEEN DONE GO TO ANOTHER FOLDER AND EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING PYTHON COMMANDS IMPORT MODULE MODULE HELLO

AFTER THIS IS ALL DONE LOOK AT THE C CODE ITSELF AND THE WRAPPER CODE IN PYTHON IT HOPEFULLY WILL MAKE SOME SENSE IN YOUR CASE YOU WOULD BASICALLY NEED TO WRITE THE C WRAPPER CODE TO FIT YOUR LIBRARY BY THE WAY YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THE HISTORY BECAUSE I DID TRY TO MAKE IT REASONABLY CLEAN HOPEFULLY THIS HELPS
THE BEST OPTION IS TO RETURN THE VALUES FROM YOUR FUNCTIONS AND PASS THEM AS ARGUMENTS TO SUBSEQUENT FUNCTIONS THAT NEED THEM RELYING ON GLOBAL STATE IS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE IDEA ALSO QUESTIONS GO IN R LEARNPYTHON THIS SUBREDDIT IS FOR NEWS AND DISCUSSION
IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH CLASSES AND CREATING INSTANCES OF CLASSES X Y AND Z WOULD BE LIKE INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES AND A NEW INSTANCE IS CREATED EVERY TIME YOU RUN THE FUNCTION
JUST DON'T USE FUNCTIONS
OH MAN ARE YOU IN FOR SOME FUN

FIRST OFF IT IS GENERALLY BETTER FOR YOUR EDIFICATION TO POST TO R LEARNPYTHON OTHER PEOPLE USUALLY POINT IT OUT BEFORE ME BUT I CONSIDER IT TO BE GOOD ETIQUETTE REPETITION IS KEY

MOVING ON WITHOUT KNOWING PRECISELY WHY YOU ARE TRYING TO PUT YOUR CODE TOGETHER THAT WAY I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON IT SAVE THAT IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A VERY GOOD REASON TO EXIST IF IT DID

YOU WANNA HAVE FUN WITH SCOPES CHECK THIS NONSENSE OUT

I BELIEVE THIS IS IT
DISCLOSURE I'M ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE PYTHON APPRENTICE

I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THE FURORE AROUND LPTHW AND ZED ATTACK ON PYTHON I'VE BEEN DEVELOPING WITH PYTHON SINCE PYTHON 2 AROUND AND PROGRAMMING EXCLUSIVELY IN PYTHON FOR FIVE YEARS NOW SINCE PYTHON PYTHON 2 SEEMS LIKE A DISTANT MEMORY MY ONLY RECENT CONTACT WITH PYTHON IS OCCASIONALLY TWEAKING MY OWN OPEN SOURCE CODE SO IT SO IT IS BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WITH PYTHON

PYTHON IS THE ONLY VIABLE FUTURE
GREAT TO SEE A CONSTRUCTIVE COMEBACK THUMBS UP
LOOKING AT THE TABLE OF CONTENTS IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S RATHER BASIC FOR ME AND SINCE I CANT SEE A SAMPLE OF THE WRITING STYLE IM HOLDING OFFICIAL I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW WHEN AND WHAT YOUR SEQUELS WILL COVER PYTHON JOURNEYMAN PYTHON MASTER
IS PYTHON 2 DONE NOW
SO YOU PITCH THE BOOK AS TEACHING BEST PRACTICES BUT YOUR PREVIEW SHOWS YOU DECIDED TO USE METHODS WHERE PROPERTIES ARE THE BEST PRACTICE

IS THERE A REASON FOR THIS

I'D REJECT ANY CODE THAT I'M REVIEWING IF IT DID WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR FLIGHT CLASSICAL
I HAVE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEER FOR YEARS THE LAST OF WHICH I'VE SPENT USING PYTHON THE BEFORE THAT WERE USING A VARIETY OF OTHER LANGUAGES PYTHON IS UNIQUE IN THIS TOXIC FANBOI SHIT BURY YOUR HEADS FOLKS YOU'LL BE IRRELEVANT SOON
SPLIT

IDEALLY I'D LIKE TO USE JASON PARSING UNFORTUNATELY THE PACKETS PICKED UP BY PYSHARK SHARK DON'T CONTAIN THE COMPLETE JASON STRING ONLY FRAGMENTS SEARCHING FOR TEXT DATA AND GRIPPING FOR TEXT KNOWN TO BE NEARBY TO THE ROOMED IS THE NEXT BEST THING

BUT WHY NOT JUST USE REGEL IT WOULD BE SO MUCH CLEANER

I AGREE BUT HEY THIS WORKS YOU WOULDN'T GET ANY MORE RELIABILITY OUT OF USING REGEL IT WOULD RETURN THE SAME DATA AND THE BOTTLENECK IS ON THE NETWORK ANYWAY

MEMORY POINTERS INSTEAD OF UNRELIABLE PACKET SNIFFING

JACKBOX DOESN'T STORE THE CURRENT ROOM ID AT A STATIC POINTER THAT WAS THE FIRST THING I TRIED DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER THAN THIS SOLUTION
HM IS NOT CONNECTION REFUSED BUT BAD GATEWAY WELL AT LEAST IN HETP LAND AND THAT USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN THE LOAD BALANCER PROXY TO THE REAL SERVER LOSES CONNECTION TO SAID SERVER THE WHOLE ERRORS REPRESENT SERVER ERRORS WHICH YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER IT'S THEIR SIDE BREAKING NOT YOURS
I DON'T MEAN TO SO PLEASE MODS DELETE IF SO BUT I HAVE A FREE API AS I FOUND THE YAHOO FINANCE ONE UNRELIABLE

AND CHECK OUT THE DOCS FOR DAILY PRICES I SECURED LICENSING RIGHTS SO YOU MAY REDISTRIBUTE AS YOU WILLIAM

JUST A HEADS UP YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN ACCOUNT SO I CAN PUT BANDWIDTH LIMITS PRETTY SANE JUST TO PREVENT ADOS ALSO I MAY AT SOME POINT HAVE TO START CHARGING SINCE TICKERS BUT IT WOULD BE REASONABLE AT MONTH I FIGURE PEOPLE WILL PAY IT FOR A RELIABLE EXPANSIVE API

EDIT I FORGOT TO MENTION I HAVE COPY PASTE PYTHON SNIPPETS
TRANSFER A FILE FROM ONE COMPUTER TO ANOTHER WITHOUT THE NEED OF KNOWING EITHER HOSTNAME
I CREATED A BUSINESS NAME BRAINSTORMING WEBSITE HETP

THE IDEA IS YOU TYPE IN SOME WORDS OR SENTENCES THAT RELATE TO YOUR IDEA AND THE WEBSITE WILL GENERATE BUSINESS NAMES FOR YOU I HAVE FOUND IT QUITE HELPFUL WHEN JUST LOOKING TO BRAINSTORM IDEAS OR TO FIND AN OPEN NRL THAT SOUNDS GOOD
I'VE GOT A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT SITS IN MY SYSTEM TRAY ON MY WORK MACHINE THAT GIVES ME A CONTEXT MENU FULL OF HELPFUL STUFF FOR MY JOB

PULLING THE MOST RECENT CODE VERSION KICKING OFF A BUILD DATABASE BACKUPS RESTORES SUPER HANDY AND TRIMS TIME OFF MENIAL TASKS THAT I DO DOZENS OF TIMES A DAY

EDIT SO A FEW PEOPLE HAVE ASKED TO SEE THE CODE FOR THIS TO PERHAPS USE IT OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEMSELVES
THE SOURCE OF THE ACTUAL MENU ITSELF CAN BE SEEN HERE WHEN THIS STARTS UP IT LOOKS FOR A PATH IN A CONFIT FILE TO FIND A DIRECTORY FROM WHICH TO LOAD PLUGGING EACH PUGIN SCRIPT IS ASSUMED TO HAVE A REGISTERMENU FUNCTION TO BE CALLED TO ADD IT TO THE CORE CONTEXT MENU WHICH YOU CAN THEN DEFINE THE EVENT FOR

THE MAIN FILE IS A POW FILE RATHER THAN A PY ALLOWING IT TO BE RUN CONTINUALLY IN THE BACKGROUND AND NOT NEEDING TO KEEP A CMD WINDOW OPEN FOR IT BY LAUNCHING IT USING PYTHON

HOPEFULLY SOME OF YOU MAY FIND SOME USE FOR THIS IT CERTAINLY TRIMS MINUTES OFF HERE AND THERE IN MY DAY GENERALLY MAKING THINGS EASIER
TRYING TO GET A JOB AT A UNIVERSITY THAT RARELY HAS OPENINGS SO RATHER THAN CHECKING THEIR SITE OVER AND OVER I HAVE A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT EMAILS ME EVERYTIME THEY POST A NEW IT JOB

ANOTHER RECENT SCRIPT WAS HELPING MY WIFE COMBINE IMAGES SHE HAD A PICTURE OF A FULL DRESS AND THEN A CLOSE UP OF THE PATTERN ON THE FABRIC ABOUT OF THEM IT WAS SLOW GOING WITH PHOTOSHOP TO PUT THE IMAGES SIDE BY SIDE THEN WATERMARK IT PYTHON PILLOW MADE SHORT WORK OF IT THOUGH
NOT A DEVELOPER I WORK AS A FINANCIAL ANALYST

I WROTE A SCRIPT TO EXTRACT DATA FROM AN UNWIELDY XML PERIODICALLY PUBLISHED BY A REGULATOR AND WRITE THE INTERESTING PARTS IN A EXCEL SHEET THAT I CAN MANAGE WITH MY USUAL TOOLS
BACK IN MY THIRD YEAR OF UNIVERSITY I WROTE A PROGRAM THAT WOULD SCAN A WORD DOC AND DO MY STATS HOMEWORK FOR ME THE FORMAT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME ON THE DOC SO I'D JUST HAVE TO TELL IT WHAT THE QUESTION WANTED ONCE IT HAD ALL THE NUMBERS SAVED ME A BUNCH OF TIME AND SINCE I WROTE IT MYSELF I DIDN'T THINK IT COUNTED AS CHEATING
WROTE A PYTHON SCRIPT WHICH YOU CAN USE TO DOWNLOAD SONGS FROM YOUR PONTIFY PLAYLIST PUBLISHED IT ON PEPI AS WELL
A BUNCH OF
A VIDEO CONVERTER WITH HARDSUBBING FUNCTION TO WATCH ANY VIDEO ON ANY DEVICE IT ALSO SAVES ALL FONTS FOUND WITHIN MKS TO MY FONT COLLECTION ONE TV SERIES HAD MORE THAN A HUNDRED
A SCAN SPLITTER WHICH DETECTS THE BORDER BETWEEN SPREAD PAGES OF A BOOK
A SPLITTER WHICH CUTS PIXEL FILES INTO SOMETHING I COULD READ ON MY TABLET NATURALLY WITH A SCENE DETECTION
A PROGRAM WHICH ADDS FINGERPRINTS TO IMAGE FILE NAMES SO SIMILAR IMAGES WOULD STAY TOGETHER WHEN SORTED ALPHABETICALLY
A PROGRAM CONVERTING IMAGE FOLDER TO PDF WHICH CAN BE OPENED ON MY
A BILINGUAL MAKER WHICH COMBINES TWO LANGUAGE VERSION OF THE SAME BOOK INTO A 2 COLUMN PDF SO I COULD PRACTICE OTHER LANGUAGES
A PROGRAM WHICH CONVERTS AN ENGLISH BOOK INTO CYRILLIC PHONETIC TRANSCRIPTION SO I COULD PRACTICE THIS INSANE PRONUNCIATION WHILE READING
SINCE PYTHON IS EMBEDDED INTO VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM I USE IN MY WORK I WROTE A BUNCH OF SCRIPTS TO MANAGE CAMERAS EXPORT INFO AND ORGANISE STUFF
THE COMPANY I WORK FOR JUST SWITCHED FROM LOTUS NOTES TO OUTLOOK BUT NEGLECTED TO PROVIDE A CLIENT FOR LINUX USERS MY WHOLE TEAM AND TURNED OFF ALL POP IMAP FUNCTIONALITY THIS FORCED US TO USE A CRAPPY WEB CLIENT AND MISS A TON OF NOTIFICATIONS OF EMAIL CALENDAR EVENTS ETC I WROTE A SCRIPT THAT LOGS IN AND PERIODICALLY SCRAPES THE WEB CLIENT FOR VARIOUS NOTIFICATIONS THEN ROUTES THEM AS BUS NOTIFICATIONS SO WE GET A LITTLE TRAY MOP-UP IN GNOME ADE

IT'S NOT A PERFECT SETUP BUT WORKS WELL ENOUGH WHILE WE TRY TO PETITION THE OVERLORDS FOR SANCTIONED LINUX SUPPORT
MY BAND HAD DOZENS OF HOURS OF RAW CAMERA FOOTAGE AND THE TASK OF MAKING SENSE OF IT TO FORM A COHERENT PROMO VIDEO WAS SO DAUNTING THAT IT KEPT ANYONE FROM DOING IT

INSTEAD I JUST WROTE A SCRIPT TO RANDOMLY DRAW VIDEO SNIPPETS AND COMBINE THEM UNDER OUR STUDIO RECORDINGS

SEE FINISHED PRODUCT HERE AND HERE
I'M A MAPMAKER ONE THING I DO A LOT IS TAKE INFORMATION FROM ONE LAYER OF INFORMATION SAY NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARIES AND PUT IT IN ANOTHER SAY FIRE HYDRANTS USUALLY THE TWO LAYERS DON'T HAVE A CONVENIENT COMMON FIELD TO CONNECT THEM SO I HAVE TO DO A JOIN TO A NEW LAYER BASED ON THEIR SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP AND THEN COPY THE FIELD BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE FILE

I FINALLY GOT TIRED OF DOING THIS AND WROTE A SCRIPT THAT DOES THE SPATIAL JOIN AUTOMATICALLY THEN PULLS THE DATA INTO A DICTIONARY THAT IT USES TO POPULATE THE TARGET FIELD IN THE ORIGINAL SOURCE DATA SAVES ME A FEW MINUTES AT A TIME BUT AS OFTEN AS I DO THIS STUFF IT ADDS UP
A SCRIPT TO PARSE THE LATEST WEEKLY AD FOR THE GROCERY STORE ACROSS THE STREET TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY CURRENT DEALS ON HOT CHEEROS
I'VE POSTED THIS BEFORE BUT HERE IT IS AGAIN

THIS SCRIPT LISTENS TO MEETINGS I'M SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO AND PINGS ME ON HIPHALT WHEN MY NAME IS MENTIONED

IT SENDS ME A TRANSCRIPT OF WHAT WAS SAID IN THE MINUTE BEFORE MY NAME WAS MENTIONED AND SOME TIME AFTER

IT ALSO PLAYS AN AUDIO FILE OUT LOUD SECONDS AFTER MY NAME WAS MENTIONED WHICH IS A RECORDING OF ME SAYING SORRY I DIDN'T REALIZE MY MIC WAS ON MUTE THERE
AUTOMATICALLY GATHER A BUNCH OF STATISTICS ON GITHUB PULL REQUESTS
FIND A NEW DOMAIN TO REGISTER FOR AN EMAIL ADDRESS TO READ OVER THE PHONE
MAKE IT EASIER TO MANAGE LPF RECORDS
DEQUEUE ALL THE JOBS IN A CI SYSTEM WHEN WE HAD ISSUES
ASSIGN A BUNCH OF LABELS TO GITHUB PULLS

MORE BUT MY PHONE IS ABOUT TO DIE
BACK IN HIGHSCHOOL WHEN I TOOK AP US HISTORY THE TEACHER HAD US DO FLASH CARDS SO I FED A SPREADSHEET OF THEM TO A SCRIPT THAT WOULD SEARCH IT AND USE DEFINITION BOX THAT APPEARS NEAR THE TOP OF THE PAGE
DESIMONE POPEYE

I WORK AT A STARTUP AND BEFORE I GOT THERE ALL THEIR ANALYSIS ROUTINES WERE MOVE THIS FILE OUT OF THIS FOLDER RUN THIS PROGRAM MOVE THE FILE BACK INTO THE FOLDER RUN THIS OTHER PROGRAM UPLOAD THE DATA TO THE NETWORK THEN IMPORT IT INTO EXCEL ETC ALL FOR ONE DATA SET

FUCK THAT I WROTE A SCRIPT THAT TAKES CARE OF ALL THE PIDDLY SHIT SO YOU CAN JUST RUN IT AND WALK AWAY AND IN MINUTES DING RESULTS

READ A FEW HUNDRED COMPANY CHEMISTRY OUTPUT FILES FIND THE LAST NUMBER FOR ENERGY AND PUT ALL OF THEM INTO A CSF FILE
ALSO A SCRIPT TO GENERATE ALL THE POSSIBLE PERMUTATIONS FOR MOLECULE INPUTS
IT'S SOMETHING I JUST FINISHED A SCRIPT THAT I USE TO WRITE MY POWERLIFTING WORKOUT LOGS TO A SALITE DATABASE I USED TO WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN BY HAND IN LITTLE JOURNALS AFTER I PUT ALL OF MY OLD WORKOUTS IN THE DATABASE YEARS WORTH IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE WHILE ALL FUTURE WORKOUTS WILL JUST BE ENTERED THROUGH THE TERMINAL I CAN THEN PERFORM ANALYSIS ON MY TRAINING WITH PANDAS AND OTHER LIBS
I CREATED A PYTHON APPLICATION AND FULL INSTALLER TOO ON WINDOWS THAT ALLOWS FOR A USER TO ON ANY PY FILE THEY CREATED AND COMPILE IT TO A SINGLE AXE FILE EITHER THAT APP WILL RUN IN THE CONSOLE OR MODE IT'S PYINSTALLER ALL IN ONE SHOT
NICOLEWHITE SIMPLEBANK

I BUILT AN API FOR MY BANK IT ALLOWS ME TO CREATE MY MONTHLY GOALS WITH A SCRIPTURE THEY'VE BEEN SAYING RECURRING GOALS ARE COMING SOON FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS NOW SO I BUILT THIS
WROTE A SCRIPT THAT APPLIES TO DAILY WEB CONTESTS
I CREATED AN APPLICATION THAT COPIED THE SYNOPSES VERDI AWAVE INTERFACE FOR DEBUGGING EMBEDDED POWER MANAGEMENT FIRMWARE ON INTEL CPUS IN SIMULATION MY MANAGER BELIEVED THE TOOL WAS A WASTE OF TIME SO I DID MY DEVELOPMENT PRIMARILY WHILE COMMUTING IN TO WORK ON LIGHT RAIL AND SOME DURING MY NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS I POLISHED IT AS WELL AS I COULD OVER TWO YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT IN MINUTE SPRINTS ON MAX I NEVER RECEIVED ANY RECOGNITION FOR HAVING CREATED IT WHEN I LEFT INTEL PRESERVATION OF THE SOURCE CODE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE FM

I RECENTLY SPOKE WITH ONE OF MY FORMER COLLEAGUES AND ASKED ABOUT MY APPARENTLY HE THOUGHT IT UNUSUAL THAT I THOUGHT THE TOOL WAS FOR MEANT FOR DEBUGGING WHEN IT WAS REALLY DESIGNED FOR HELPING FIRMWARE ARCHITECTS HE WAS A FIRMWARE ARCHITECT AND USED IT I CAN'T EVEN GET RECOGNITION FOR IT AFTER LEAVING FM
WROTE A PROGRAM THAT WOULD PRESS THE WINDOWS KEY TWICE EVERY MINUTES SO THAT MY COMPUTER WOULDN'T LOG ME OUT WHEN IDLE OUR COMPANY POLICY LOGS YOU OFF WHEN IDLE BUT SOMETIMES I NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE SCREEN BUT NOT BE AT THE COMPUTER FOR MORE THAN MINUTES DRIVES ME NUTS SO I FIXED IT DON'T TELL IT
CREATED A SCRIPT THAT SEARCHES A FOLDER FOR C ASSIGNMENTS FROM STUDENTS AUTOMATICALLY COMPILES THEM SAVES THE COMPILATION OUTPUT AND DISPLAYS A MENU THAT ALLOWS ME TO EXPLORE WHICH ASSIGNMENTS COMPILED WITH AND W O WARNINGS ERRORS READ THE COMPILATION OUTPUT AND EXECUTE ANY OF THE GENERATED EXECUTABLE FROM THE SAME TERMINAL IN THE END IT DELETES ALL OF THE GENERATED FILES SO I CAN HAVE A NICE GIT REPO WITHOUT CLUTTER
IS THAT GAME CHECKED IN TO MY LOCAL LIBRARY NO FINE I'LL CHECK AGAIN IN AN HOUR
A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT PRETTY PRINTS JASON IT ALIGNS COLONS AND DOES LINE BREAKS ONLY WHEN APPROPRIATE USED AS A COMMAND YOU CAN PIPE JASON INTO IT AND IT WILL WRITE PRETTY PRINTED JASON TO STOUT

NOTHING SPECIAL TO SHOW IN A REPOSITORY BUT I CREATED A SCRIPT TO PROCESS PDF EACH WEEK A GOVERMENT INSTITUTION SENT SHEETS OF NAMES IN PDF THAT REQUIRED ONE-TWO PEOPLE WORKING ALL THE WEEK TRANSCRIBING NAMES AND SS NUMBERS IN OUR DATABASE

FURTHERMORE IF SOMEBODY MADE A MISTAKE LET'S SAY THREE WEEKS AGO ALL WORK DONE SHOULD BE REDONE STARTING FROM THAT WEEK ON

MY SCRIPT CONVERTED DFS TO TEXT USING PDFTOTEXT LINUX UTILITY AND ALL THAT WORK COULD BE DONE IN A FEW SECONDS JUST BY USING A FEW REGULAR EXPRESSIONS LUCKILY MANAGEMENT DECIDED NOT TO FIRE ANYBODY AND USE THESE TWO COLLEAGUES FOR USEFUL TASKS
SUPPORT TOOLSHED PORTAL TO HANDLE HETEROGENEOUS SYSTEM DATA ANALYSIS ITS A COMMAND LINE TOOLSHED WITH A UI ADAPTER IT HANDLES COMMAND LINE CALLS AND CONVERT IT INTO GENERIC STRUCTURES THIS RESULT CAN FORWARD BY MAIL CLIENT STOUT OR AS RESULT AFTER CALLING BY JEBUSI OVER NETWORK

I LIKE THIS TOOLSHED BECAUSE I CAN ONLY CREATE A NEW COMMAND LINE TOOL AND HAVE AUTOMATICALLY A WEB UI MAPPING TOO THE WEB UI CONTROL FORM ARE GENERATED FROM ARGPARSE OBJECT WHICH WAS CONVERTED INTO JASON IF I NEED I CAN APPEND AN OTHER VIEW BASED ON TEMPLATES FDR EACH COMMAND

CODE LESS DO MORE
AN ALDUINO KITTED WITH VARIOUS THINGS TO LET ME CONTROL MY HOUSE FROM AN ANDROID APPARENTLY THE PYTHON IS IN THE DURANGO SERVER LETTING ME CONNECT FROM ANYWHERE SET SCHEDULES FOR LIGHTS ETC THE DURANGO SERVER SENDS COMMANDS OVER A BLUETOOTH CONNECTION

BASIC FUNCTIONALITY AND APP ARE FUNCTIONAL I'M JUST WAITING ON PARTS
I LIKE TO SAVE ALL MY TEXT MESSAGES I'VE SAVED THE MAJORITY OF THEM SINCE THEY'RE IN A MIXTURE OF SALITE IPHONE AND XML ANDROID FILES I WROTE A SMALL PYTHON SCRIPT THAT'S TAKES ALL THE XML BACKUPS CREATE A SALITE DB OF THEM AS WELL AS DECODE THE RAW BASE IMAGES

IT'S FUN TOO SEE AND CRINGE AT THE STUFF I USED TO SAY
I DO VIDEO ON THE SIDE SO I KNOCKED TOGETHER AN FFMPEG SCRIPT WITH FEMPTY AWESOME LIB TO PROCESS MY RAW VIDEOS

MY RECORDED VIDEO FILES WITH AUDIO STREAMS GO IN AND IT SPITS OUT AN IMAGE SEQUENCE MUCH EASIER TO EDIT IMAGE SEQUENCES THAN COMPRESSED VIDEO AND SEPARATE STEREO WAC FILES FOR EACH AUDIO STREAM AS WELL AS A COMPRESSED COPY OF THE ORIGINAL VIDEO WITH 2 OF THE AUDIO STREAMS MIXED INTO A SINGLE STREAM FOR EASY DISTRIBUTION AND BACKUP

THIS MAKES PROCESSING THE BACKLOG MUCH EASIER SO I CAN CONCENTRATE ON THE CUTTING AND FINISHING PROCESS

DOING THIS WITHOUT FFMPEG PYTHON WOULD HAVE ME SAT AT A WORKSTATION DOING THESE THREE TASKS ONE AFTER THE OTHER TIME I COULD BE SPENT DOING SOMETHING MORE PRODUCTIVE I LOVE PYTHON FOR JOBS LIKE THIS
YEARS AGO I WROTE A LITTLE SCRIPT THAT WOULD TRANSLATE SR SUBTITLES USING GOOGLE TRANSLATE API I REALLY WANTED TO WATCH AN ANIME WHICH I COULD ONLY FIND WITH SPANISH SUBS IT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL AND IT WAS A GREAT FEELING TO FINALLY SOLVE AN ACTUAL PROBLEM OF MINE USING PYTHON
I DO A LOT OF TECHNICAL BLOGGING AND NEED TO QUICKLY TAKE SCREENSHOTS VIA DSX SCREENCAPTURE AND PRODUCE THE HEML TAGS OR MARKDOWN WHICH I INTO MY BLOG

SO I WROTE A LITTLE SCRIPT NAMED SCREENY WHICH I RUN FROM THE COMMAND LINE

SAMPLE USAGE

SCREENY IMAGES

PRODUCES THIS MARKDOWN AND HEML CODE WHICH I

BMG SRC IMAGES ALT

OR IF I'M IN A RUSH I JUST PIPE IT STRAIGHT INTO PRECOPY

MAKES PRODUCING LENGTHY ILLUSTRATED TECHNICAL POSTS A LOT EASIER EAST G



WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL I HATED MATH EVEN THOUGH I WAS GOOD AT IT I ALSO HATED HOMEWORK SO I MADE A CALCULATOR THAT WOULD HANDLE ANY GEOMETRY CALCULATION IT WORKED FOR ANY 2D OR 3D OBJECT AND WOULD ASK YOU FOR THE DIMENSIONS THAT YOU HAD THEN WOULD GIVE YOU SURFACE AREA VOLUME PERIMETER AND WOULD DO SIDE ANGLE SIDE FOR YOU

AFTER THAN I NEVER SPENT MORE THAN MINUTES ON MY MATH HOMEWORK
THE WEBSITE ACTS AS AN INTERMEDIARY FOR PEOPLE LOOKING TO SELL OR BUY 2ND HAND TICKETS FOR FESTIVALS HERE IN THE NETHERLANDS IT'S QUITE BIG

THE HASSLE HOWEVER IS THAT FOR POPULAR FESTIVALS THE TICKETS ARE HARD TO GET DUE TO PEOPLE SCAMMING THE PAGES FOR NEW TICKETS THIS CAN BE VERY ANNOYING IF YOU REALLY WANT A TICKET

I WROTE A PROGRAM THAT LOGS INTO FACEBOOK THEN INTO TICKETSWAP AND KEEPS SCANNING THE PAGE OF THE FESTIVAL LOOKING FOR NEW TICKETS AND IF THEY MEET MY PRICE DEMANDS IT AUTOMATICALLY RESERVES THE TICKET ON THE ACCOUNT IT THEN SENDS ME OR WHOEVER WANTS TICKET AN SMS TEXT WITH THE ACCOUNT AND TICKET INFO SO THEY CAN LOGIN AND PURCHASE THE TICKET

ME AND A LOT OF MY FRIENDS USE IT REGULARLY LESS TIME HITTING THE BUTTON MEANS MORE TIME TO PARTY YAY


TO REMOVE DOCKER IMAGES FROM HOSTS AFTER NOT BEING USED FOR ONE WEEK
I USED TO WRITE LOTS OF MEMOS FOR ONGOING PENDING CLAIMS WROTE A SCRIPT TO AUTOMATE THE CREATION OF THOSE MEMOS USING DATA POPULATED FROM CSIS AS PLAIN CUTS DOWN WRITING TIME FOR EACH MEMO FROM MINS TO ABOUT SECS EACH CREATION TIME TAKES LESS THAN A SECOND IT'S THE MANUAL CHECKING WHICH TAKES UP THE BALANCE OF THE SECONDS

WEATHER STATUS AND FORECAST

A BUS REMINDER THAT SCRAPES THE TIMETABLE PAGE FROM THE BUS COMPANY'S WEBSITE AND SENDS ME THE TIMES IN A MESSAGE AND REMINDS ME WHEN I NEED TO START PACKING UP TO GET THE NEXT BUS USEFUL SINCE THE BUSES ARE INFREQUENT AT QUITE RANDOM TIMES AND THE TIME I LEAVE THE OFFICE VARIES QUITE A BIT

A TO SHOW ME PATCHES AND NEWS ITEMS FROM STEAM GAMES I USE

AN EVENT THAT'S MADE FOR THE GROUP CHAT I HAVE WITH FRIENDS ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CREATE EVENTS SUCH AS FOR ONLINE GAMING ONE CAN RESERVE A PLACE ETC WITH CALLBACK BUTTONS ATTACHED TO THE MESSAGE

A THAT ALLOWS ME TO KEEP TRACK OF GOING TO THE GYM I CHECK IN AT THE GYM BY SENDING IT MY LOCATION WHEN I'M THERE IT SHAMES ME IF I HAVEN'T BEEN IN A WHILE

THE BOT IS MADE IN A WAY THAT MAKING NEW IS SUPER EASY AND THEY INTERFACE WITH TELEGRAM SIDE OF THINGS USING A BIXIN THAT REGISTERS COMMANDS AND CALLBACKS TO BE DISPATCHED TO THE RIGHT FUNCTIONS ETC SO IF I THINK OF A NEW SIMPLE FEATURE THAT WOULD BE USEFUL I CAN JUST MAKE A SIMPLE CLASS THAT USES THE PUGIN BIXIN AND BUNG IT IN THE FOLDER AND IT'LL BE LOADED UP AUTOMATICALLY
WROTE A SCRIPT THAT READS MY PONTIFY SAVES AND CREATES A PONTIFY PLAYLIST OF BANDS I MIGHT LIKE THAT ARE COMING TO MY TOWN USING SONGKICK NOW I CAN JUST FIRE UP THE PLAYLIST AND HEAR WITH REAL CONCERT POTENTIAL BASED ON SONGKICK I LIKE IT WELL I USED TO IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE I SHOULD FIX IT

I HALF FINISHED A NEXT STEP THAT READS MY GOOGLE CALENDAR AND DOES THE PLAYLIST BASED NOT ON MY HOME TOWN BUT RATHER WHEREVER I'LL BE I TRAVEL A LOT I THINK ALL TOGETHER THIS COULD BE AWESOME BUT EVEN THE SIMPLER VERSION IS REALLY NICE
WELL IT'S BEEN A HOBBY OF MINE FOR A WHILE SAVED ME LOTS OF MONEY

AFTER YOUTUBE REMOVED SUBSCRIPTION LISTS I MADE A SCRIPT THAT FETCHES NEW VIDEOS FROM SPECIFIC YOUTUBE CHANNELS AND AUTOMATICALLY ADDS THEM TO MY WATCH LATER PLAYLIST TIMES A DAY AND WHEN I'M DONE I CAN PRESS THE REMOVE WATCHED BUTTON CLEARING THE LIST FOR THE NEXT BATCH OF VIDEOS

IT IS NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT CODE BUT THE USER EXPERIENCE IS PRETTY AWESOME IT USES EMAIL ME NOTIFICATION AND FETCHES THE VIDEO LINKS FROM MY MAIL IT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO SUBSCRIBE UNSUBSCRIBE TO PEOPLE FROM INSIDE YOUTUBE AT THE MOMENT MAILS ARE STILL IN MY INBOW BUT IT HAVEN'T BOTHERED ME ENOUGH TO CREATE A RULE TO MOVE THEM OUT OF THE WAY

EDIT I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT MAKING A CHROME EXTENSION AND ELIMINATE THE MAIL SYSTEM ALTOGETHER THEN IT MIGHT BE MORE FEASIBLE TO PROVIDE AS A SERVICE FOR OTHER PEOPLE BUT HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME
WROTE SOMETHING TO DELETE ALL POSTS FROM A SUBREDDIT I MODERATE

I WROTE A ONE TIME SCRIPT FOR MY WORK TO FILL OUT A PDF FORM FOR MACHINES THAT WE WERE REQUESTING APPROVAL TO BE DESTROYED THE FORM HAS TO BE FILLED OUT BASED UPON THE FUNDING PROJECT AND COULD ONLY HAVE A MAX OF MACHINES LISTED I TOOK THE EXCEL TABLES WE HAD IT THE MACHINES FOR DISPOSAL AND THE OTHER ONE FOR THE FUNDING INTO AND IMPORTED IT INTO SALITE WITH 2 QUERIES AND A COUPLE FOR LOOPS IT WOULD GENERATE FDA FILES WHICH WOULD BE THE DATA TO FILL OUT THE FORMS WITH USING PDFTK TO COMBINE IT WITH THE ACTUAL PDF REDUCED THE WORKLOAD FROM FILLING OUT ABOUT MACHINES TO BARELY ANYTHING MY BOSS ASKED ME TO PUT IT IN THE INTERNAL WIKI BUT IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK BECAUSE IMPORTING IS A PRETTY MANUAL PROCESS TO A RANDOM PERSON LOOKING TO USE THE SCRIPTURE
CONVERTING TEXT BASED LYRICS AND CHORDS TO CHLORO AND THEN TO HEML FOR MY SONGBOOK

WROTE A DOUBLE ENTRY ACCOUNTING SYSTEM YEARS AGO MOSTLY IN AWK BEEN CONVERTING SLOWLY TO PYTHON

VARIOUS FILE CONVERSION PROGRAMS LIKE DIGGING AIF INFO FROM MEDIA FILES TABLE FORMATS HEML TV ETC BUILDING WEB PAGES FROM TABULAR DATA BIOINFORMATICS FILES

SO NO BIG WHOOP
A PYTHON META ORCHESTRATOR OVER AN OPENSTACK PLATFORM
MICROSOFT ACCESS DATABASE FILES

SIGH WHY
I HAVE SO MANY OF THEM HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE TOOLS FOR EVERY OTHER PROJECT I WORK ON A NOTIFIER FOR WHEN KICKSTARTER REWARDS GO BACK ONLINE AND AN IRC BOT THAT POSTS LUNCH IN OUR CHANNEL EVERY DAY I'VE MADE COUNTLESS THINGS AND DEFINITELY HAVE FAILED TO MENTION SOME OF THE COOLEST BUT THOSE COME TO MIND RIGHT NOW AND AREN'T TOO COMPLICATED

RIGHT NOW THOUGH I'M WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GONNA MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR ME I CALL IT ANIMORNING IT'S AN ALARM CLOCK THAT RUNS ON YOUR RASPBERRY PI AND EVERY MORNING IT WAKES YOU UP WITH THE NEXT EPISODE OF AN ANIME YOU'RE WATCHING IT'S ALMOST DONE I'M PUTTING A LOT OF WORK INTO ITS WEB IT'LL BE VERY NICE TO BE WOKEN UP COMFORTABLY BY A NICE TV SHOW INSTEAD OF ABRUPTLY AND CONSTANTLY SNOOZING BY MUSIC OR BEEPING

JUST THE WORD IF YOU'D LIKE MORE INFO ON SOMETHING OR A DOWNLOAD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
THIS IS MY MOST RECENT I USE PYTHON EXTENSIVELY FOR MY JOB AND FIND IT MY LANGUAGE FOR CREATING USEFUL LITTLE PROGRAMS TO FACILITATE MY DAY TO DAY IN MY SPARE TIME I LIVE CODE VISUALS AT ALGORAVES USING A PROGRAM CALLED FLUXES BASICALLY CODING REACTIVE VISUALS ON THE FLY TO MUSIC THAT IS CODED ON THE FLY A KEY PART OF THIS IS THAT YOUR SCREEN CODE AND ALL IS PROJECTED

FLUXES IS SCHEME BASED AND TAKES VECTORS FOR COLOUR VALUES EACH VALUE PRESENTING AN R G B CHANNEL BETWEEN AND FOR EXAMPLE RED WOULD BE VECTOR

I'M ALSO BIG ON COLOUR AND LIKE TO COLLECT PALETTES OF PERFECT HUES OFTEN CONVERTING HEX TO RGB OR PICKING COLOURS ON PHOTOSHOP OF COURSE THESE ARE ALL REPRESENTED AS AND DURING A LIVE SET I NEED TO EITHER HAVE A LIST PREPARED OR BE ABLE TO CONVERT THEM QUICKLY WITHOUT CAUSING UPROAR WITH MY PROJECTION WHILST BEING ABLE TO REACT TO THE MUSIC TIME IS ESSENTIAL HERE

SO PRETTY SIMPLY I USED TINTER TO RETURN RGB VALUES AS FLUXES FRIENDLY VECTORS SHOW SWATCHES TO ENSURE I HAVE A GOOD COLOUR MATCH OUTPUT MULTIPLE COLOURS AS A LIST

REALLY SIMPLE BUT SO USEFUL FOR MY NICHE NEED


I HAVE A LOT OF THESE BECAUSE MY WORK WAS VERY MANUAL BEFORE I GOT THERE

AUTO FILL IN MY TIMECARD I HAVE A SITE THAT I CAN HIT WHICH LOGS MY TIME THEN EVERY MONDAY IT USES SELENIUM TO TAKE THOSE ENTRIES AND ENTERS THEM INTO OUR WORK SITE WHICH IS AN OLD JAVA SITE

2 EVERY HOUR GO OUT AND NC INTO EVERY ONE OF OUR SCOREBOARDS ON A MANUFACTURING FLOOR AND TAKE A SCREENSHOT AND SAVE THE IMAGE SO IT CAN BE VIEWED ON A WEB PAGE ALL AT ONCE TO SEE FOR ISSUES AND MAKE BACKUPS OF ALL THE LAST OF IMAGES

I HAVE A SITE WHERE I CAN ADD TORRENT LINKS MY HOME SERVER GOES OUT AND CHECKS THE SITE EVERY MINUTES AND IF THERE'S A NEW LINK IT ADDS IT TO MY LOCAL TORRENT APP AND BEGINS THE DOWNLOAD PROCESS THIS IS GREAT WHEN I WANT TO DOWNLOAD SOMETHING BUT I'M AT WORK AND DON'T WANT TO DO IT AT WORK OBVIOUSLY I JUST ADD THE TORRENT LINK AND MY HOME SERVER DOES IT

I RECENTLY WROTE A PROGRAM THAT HAS THE USER INPUT THEIR MONTHLY UTILITY BILLS AND DIVIDES IT BY THE AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUALS SPLITTING THE COSTS

I KNOW I COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN ENCELL THAT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER BUT I GET A KICK OUT OF LEARNING HOW TO DO IT FROM SCRATCH

I'M CURRENTLY TRYING TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM INTO A RENT BILLS CALCULATOR FOR SHARED LIVING SPACES PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW THOUGH SINCE I HAVE MINIMAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT I'M DOING LEARNING A LOT IN THE MEANTIME THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR
MOTION DETECTION SCRIPT WITH OPENCUT THAT RECORDS VIDEOS AND PUTS THEM IN DROPBOX ALSO INITIATES SOUL DESTROYING CURSING FROM THE SPEAKERS
CREATED A PROGRAM THAT READS A WORD DOCUMENT OF MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS EXAMINATION THE PROGRAM CREATES A NEW DOCUMENT WITH MULTIPLE EXAMS EACH EXAM HAS ALL THE QUESTIONS SHUFFLED AND THE ANSWER IN EACH QUESTION SHUFFLED AS WELL

2 CREATED A PROGRAM THAT GENERATES RANDOM ENCOUNTER FOR MY IND CAMPAIGN BASED ON A DATA BASE OF CREATURES AND TREASURE THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE A POOL OF CREATURES THAT SLOWLY REDUCES AND LET THE PLAYERS TRY ROAM AROUND
I MADE A LITTLE UTILITY TO DOWNLOAD AND ORGANIZE PHOTOS FROM MY DEVICES TO MY DESKTOP

IT PULLS ALL OF THE PHOTOS FROM A STAGING AREA COPIES THEM TO THE CORRECT FOLDER BY MONTH IGNORES DUPLICATES THE FILE NAME AND DEETS THE STAGED PHOTOS WHEN COMPLETE
I MADE A SCRIPT THAT TRANSFERS AN ITUNES PLAYLIST TO A CREATIVE PLAYER THAT I OWNED BUYING AN IPOD WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAPER IF MY TIME IS WORTH ANYTHING BUT PROGRAMMING IS MORE FUN
JUST TODAY I FOUND MYSELF REFRESHING A WEBSITE TRYING TO SNAG A BLACK FRIDAY DEAL AND IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE AUTOMATED SO I SPENT MINUTES TO WRITE A QUICK SCRIPT THAT CHECKS THE PAGE FOR THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT I'M LOOKING FOR EVERY SECONDS AND IF IT FINDS A MATCH IT SHOOTS ME AN EMAIL

SMALL BUT VERY PLEASING BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST SCRIPT I'VE WRITTEN THAT WASN'T WORK RELATED AND ACTUALLY MADE MY LIFE EASIER
HAD A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT IN COMPUTER TYPOGRAPHY HAD TO MANUALLY SET UP WORD DIVISION POINTS FOR WORDS DIVIDED AT THE END OF THE LINE HAD A WORD TEXT THAT I JUST COULDN'T GO THROUGH DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER RUN EACH PAIR OF LETTERS THROUGH AN ALGORITHM MANUALLY

WHAT I DID WAS WRITE WORD BY WORD ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND IT JUST THREW OUT THE RESULT WORD PARTS WITH A HYPHEN IN-BETWEEN
SPLITS THE STRING INTO A LIST RUNS EACH LETTER PAIR THROUGH A FOR LOOP CHECKING EVERY 1ST 2ND 2ND 3RD 3RD 4TH ETC LETTERS THEN DEPENDING ON WHAT LETTERS OF THE PAIR ARE VOWELS OR CONSONANTS IT ADDS A HYPHEN BEFORE BETWEEN OR DOESNT ADD A HYPHEN DEPENDING ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF VOWELS AND CONSONANTS IN THE LETTER PAIR

I'VE STARTED DOING PYTHON WEEKS AGO AT MY UNIVERSITY THIS IS MY FIRST USEFUL PROGRAM REALLY

TO MAKE IT DO THE WHOLE TEXT ALL AT ONCE

I USED TO WORK FOR A COMPANY AND I WOULD AUTOMATE ALL THE WEBSITES WE HAD TO DO REPETITIVE TASKS ON IT INVOLVED AUTOMATION AND WEB SCRAPING I BUILT A REALLY SMALL FRAMEWORK FOR RUNNING THE AUTOMATIONS SCRAPING DATA CONNECTING TO DATABASES READING CONFIT FILES USING A BASIC TEMPLATING ENGINE SO USERS CAN DEFINE VARIABLES LISTS AND DCTS IN A FILE TO FETCH IN THE CODE AND RUNNING AUTOMATIONS AND MORE EVERYTHING IS REALLY MODULAR SO YOU CAN INSTALL THE FRAMEWORK AND ONLY USE THE PIECES YOU NEED IF YOU AREN'T AUTOMATING A WEBSITE YOU CAN STILL PULL IN THE CONFIT PARSER OR USE THE DATABASE MIGRATIONS AND WHATNOT

THERE IS EVEN AN ADAPTER TO GET REQUESTS TO ACT LIKE SELENIUM S WEBDRIVER SO YOU CAN USE REQUESTS ALONG WITH BEAUTIFULSOUP AND LAMEL TO TRAVERSE A WEBSITES DOM AND SCRAPE DATA USING SELENIUM S SYNTAX I EAST

ELEMENT BODY UNDERNAME
PRINT

YOU JUST CAN'T INTERACT WITH A WEBPAGE LIKE YOU COULD WITH SELENIUM IF YOU ARE USING THE REQUESTS ADAPTER THIS ALSO REQUIRES A COUPLE MORE MODULES TO USE REQUESTS BEAUTIFULSOUP AND LAMEL

YOU CAN RUN JOBS SPECIAL CASE FILES THAT CONTAIN CODE FOR DOING A SPECIFIC THING THEY SOUND USELESS BUT IF I HAVE A SCRIPT THAT NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING AT A SPECIFIC TIME EVERY DAY OR CODE THAT ISN'T RELATED TO THE MAIN AUTOMATION IT'S EASIER FOR ME TO JUST CREATE A JOB THAT CAN BE EXECUTED WITH A SIMPLE OR WHERE SEED IS A FOLDER IN THE JOBS DIRECTORY AND USERS IS A PYTHON SCRIPT CONTAINING A FUNCTION THESE SCRIPTS ARE USUALLY OFF SCRIPTS THAT CAN BE USED TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT FOR MY PROGRAM TO RUN SEEDING A DATABASE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR THEY CAN BE SCRIPTS THAT NEED TO BE RUN BUT ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY THE MAIN PROGRAM IT'S MOSTLY AN ORGANIZATIONAL THING TO KEEP THAT CODE AWAY FROM THE OTHER BITS OF CODE THAT ARE NEEDED BY THE MAIN PROGRAM

THEN THERE IS ALSO THE PROJECT CREATOR WHICH CREATES ALL THE FILES FOLDERS NEEDED FOR THE FRAMEWORK TO ACTUALLY WORK YOU CAN BASICALLY JUST

IMPORT SLACK
DOCUMENTS PYTHON SOMENEWPROJECT

AND IT WILL CREATE ALL THE FILES YOU NEED OH AND IT SHOULD WORK WITH PYTHON AND PYTHON ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE IF ALL THE DEPENDENCIES FOR EVERYTHING ARE PYTHON COMPATIBLE YET BUT I'M PRETTY POSITIVE THEY ARE

SO THE PROGRAM I MADE TO MAKE MY LIFE EASIER IS REALLY JUST A COLLECTION OF METHODS FUNCTIONS AND CLASSES THAT MAKE BUILDING WEB AUTOMATIONS OR JUST SOFTWARE IN GENERAL A LITTLE BIT QUICKER AND TO THE POINT IT USES SOME REFLECTION TO DO A FEW OF THE THINGS IT DOES AND IT WAS A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO LEARN ABOUT OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN I'M NOT CLAIMING THE DESIGN IS PERFECT OR ANYTHING BUT IT SUITS MY NEEDS AND IT'S SIMPLE TO MAINTAIN
I MADE THIS SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO CLEAR MY BROWSER HISTORY


IT BASICALLY SEARCHING A SUBREDDITS FOR ALL IMAGE TYPES AND AND DISPLAYS THEM EITHER IN THE GUI OR IN A WEB BROWSER
I WROTE A SCRIPT TO DOWNLOAD THE SUBTITLES FOR ANY MOVIE THAT LANDS IN MY VIDEO FOLDER AUTOMATICALLY NOT THE BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENT BUT IT'S A TIME SAVER
I WROTE A SCRIPT THAT MAKES MANAGING THE SALITE ENTRIES USED BY ANOTHER BIGGER PYTHON PROJECT A LOT EASIER I CAN CHOSE TO GO INTO USER MANAGEMENT OR GLOBAL MANAGEMENT FROM A BASH SCRIPT WHICH OPENS UP THE RELEVANT PYTHON SCRIPTURE FROM THERE INPUT IS TURNED INTO SALITE QUERIES THAT MAKE THE CHANGES I WANT MUCH EASIER THAN GOING INTO THE DATABASE AND WRITING THEM MANUALLY
I'M SORT OF A STILL SO I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING SUPER COOL BUT THE FIRST TIME I FELT COMPELLED TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY WORK WAS A LITTLE ALARM

IT WOULD PLAY A BIT OF MUSIC TO WAKE ME UP READ HEADLINES AND THEN GIVE ME THE WEATHER AND TELL ME WHAT TO WEAR THAT LAST PART WAS THE CRUX BECAUSE I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HATES MAKING DECISIONS I FIGURED I'D OUTSOURCE IT TO A PROGRAM THAT WOULD TAKE THE HUMIDITY TEMP AND PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES AT DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE DAY AND MAP THAT ON TO WHAT I KNOW I LIKE TO WEAR

UNFORTUNATELY I NEVER GOT THE TIMED TASK TO RUN PROPERLY
A TOOL TO AUTOMATE TAKING PACKET CAPTURES ON MULTIPLE REMOTE MACHINES AND ALLOW FOR IMMEDIATE LOCAL VIEWING
ISN'T THE GOAL TO WRITE A PROGRAM WHICH MAKES YOUR LIFE MUCH MUCH HARDER

I MADE A PYTHON SCRIPT WHICH GENERATES A RANDOM NUMBER BETWEEN AND YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE NUMBER IN SPANISH IF YOU FAIL YOU GET ASKED AGAIN I PUT THIS IN MY BASHARA OK I CAN QUIT IT BY PRESSING CTRL C IF I AM IN A HURRY BUT IT HELPS A LOT GETTING BETTER WITH THE NUMBERS
MORE SCRIPTS THAN PROGRAMS BUT GIT GREP MULTIPLE REPOS AT ONCE AND SIMILAR GENERATE WEEKLY REPORTS FROM MY GIT COMMIT HISTORY
I WORK QA FOR A DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM AND PART OF THE TESTING PROCESS IS SETTING UP AROUND TEST APPLICATIONS ON ABOUT DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS AND INCLUDING N CLUSTERING

I WROTE A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT NOT ONLY SETS THEM UP BUT CAN BE USED TO SETUP PRETTY MUCH ANY TEST APPARENTLY

I WENT FURTHER AND THEN AUTOMATED THE ENTIRE PROCESS STARTING FROM SPINNING UP A VIRGIN VM DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING THE LATEST BUILDING CONFIGURING IT AND SETTING UP EXTERNAL RESOURCES AS NEEDED FOR A GIVEN TEST SET SETTING UP THE TESTS RUNNING THE TESTS VALIDATING THE TESTS AND THEN REPORTING THE RESULTS IT'S ALL PARAMETERIZED WITH SCRIPT HOOKS TO BE AS OPEN-ENDED AS POSSIBLE IT'S ABOUT ABOUT LIKES OF CODE WELL ABOUT IF YOU COUNT EVERYTHING BUT THAT I WROTE

IT WAS MY FIRST PROGRAM EVER PRIOR TO THAT I HAD ONLY EVER MADE SMALLISH SCRIPTS IN BASH PHS JAVASCRIPT AND OUR PROPRIETARY LANGUAGES BUT NO PYTHON I HAVE NO PROGRAMMING BACKGROUND OR EDUCATION EITHER AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT MONTHS TO COMPLETE MOSTLY IN MY SPARE TIME AS I STILL HAD TO KEEP UP ON MANUAL TESTING AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICE TYPE ISSUES

SOMEHOW THIS DIDN'T EARN ME ANY CLOUT IN THE COMPANY SEEMINGLY THE OPPOSITE EVENING NO ONE REALLY GAVE A SHIT EVEN SEEMED TO BE EVEN A LITTLE SHITTY ABOUT HOW LONG IT TOOK ME BUT AT LEAST WE'RE GETTING A BIT MORE REGRESSION COVERAGE
IT WAS SOMETIME AGO I CREATED A SIMPLE FACEBOOK IN THE TERMINAL CLI TOOL
TO SHOW ME ONLY DATA POSTS THAT I WANTED TO SEE POSTS FROM SPECIFIC PAGES OR PROFILES
IT HELPED ME TO ONLY CHECKOUT FACEBOOK ONCE OR TWICE A DAY MAX AND NOT SCROLL DOWN TO INFINITY WASTING MY TIME
IT DOESN'T WORK NOW DUE TO CHANGES IN GRAPH API
SHUFFLES YOUR PONTIFY LIBRARY AS I FIND SHUFFLE ALGORITHM REPEATS TOO MANY SONGS

GIVEN A PLAYLIST IT WILL EMPTY THAT PLAYLIST
GATHER ALL THE TRACKS IN YOUR LIBRARY
SHUFFLE THEM
ADD THEM BACK TO THE PLAYLIST
WROTE A SCRIPT TO AUTOMATE BOT TESTING FOR
TWO THINGS

A LIST OF PYTHON ARTICLES I OFTEN REFER TO
DEVOPSWIKI

A SCRIPT TO SCAFFOLD DATABASE DRIVEN WEB APPS AND

WROTE AN ENTIRE PACKAGE TO CLEAN SUMMARIZE AND ORGANIZE RESEARCH DATA FROM MY LABORATORY I'VE GOTTEN TO SEND IT OUT TO ALL OUR COLLABORATORS TOO TAKES RAW TRAINING DATA AND PROVIDES SUMMARIES AND VISUALIZATIONS
I FREQUENTLY NEED TO CONVERT FILE SIZES FROM B TO GIB OR TIB TO GIB ETC I USED TO VISIT BIT CALCULATOR IN MY WEB BROWSER TO CALCULATE PRINT A CONVERSION TABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE AFTER A WHILE I GOT TIRED OF LAUNCHING A NEW BROWSER TAB TAKING FOCUS AWAY FROM MY WORKSPACE DEALING WITH NETWORK SLOWNESS AND SUCH

I WANTED SOMETHING LOCAL THAT I COULD RUN FROM THE COMMAND LINE SO I WROTE A LITTLE UTILITY CALLED PYBITCALC THAT FUNCTIONS PRETTY SIMILARLY IT WAS A FUN PROJECT AND COMES IN HANDY ALL THE TIME

NOT NEARLY AS INTERESTING AS MANY OTHER PROJECTS IN THIS THREAD BUT I FIGURED I'D SHARE

HERE'S SOME EXAMPLE OUTPUT

ROUPS PASTE
JUST YESTERDAY A SMALL PYTHON PROGRAM LINES WHICH DOWNLOADS THE IMAGES FROM A SCRIBE PDF MOSTLY SHEET MUSIC THAT'S WHY IT'S FINE THAT IT ONLY GETS IMAGES AND PUTS THEM IN A PDF
EVERY MONTH I LAY OUT WHAT I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH AND HAVE A SET FORMAT FOR MY DAILY TASKS FOR THE WORK WEEK SO I WROTE MARKDOWNCLERK WHICH BASICALLY GENERATES ALL OF THAT FOR ME WITH A LITTLE INPUT FROM THE CLI WE USE TFS FOR OUR STORIES SO I LARGELY TRACK MY WORK IN MY MARKDOWN AND TRANSFER IT WHEN IT'S DONE BECAUSE TFS IS PAINFUL TO USE

I ALSO HAVE A SCRIPT THAT CREATES OUR SKELETON REPOS AND I'M WORKING ON MAKING IT ABLE TO GENERATE VISUAL STUDIO PROJECTS FOR ALL OF OUR NET DEVELOPERS I'VE USED COG AND COOKIECUTTER AND BOTH ARE GOOD BUT THE FORMER HAS SYNTAX I DON'T LIKE AND THE LATTER HAS WHITESPACE AND FORMATTING ISSUES
REPRESENT AND ANALYZE DATA WITH PANDAS NETWORKS DEEPGRAPH

I USE IT AS A RESEARCH PHYSICIST WORKING ON COMPLEX SYSTEMS SO FAR I HAVE USED THE PACKAGE FOR NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND CLIMATE DATA IT'S VERY HANDY IF YOU WANT TO COMPUTE AND ANALYZE RELATIONS BETWEEN OBJECTS OF SOME SYSTEM
I BUILT A SELENIUM WEBDRIVER BOT TO AUTOMATE MOBILE BANK ACCOUNT CREATIONS WE SET UP CLIENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO MOBILE CHECK DEPOSITING USING AN APP THAT THEY NEED A USER NAME AND PASSWORD FOR INSTEAD OF GIVING THE TASK TO SOMEONE TO PERFORM MANUALLY I BUILT THE WEBDRIVER BOT TO ACCEPT A CSF WITH ALL THE VITAL DATA OPEN A WEB BROWSER NAVIGATE TO THE BANK SITE AND PERFORM ALL THE DATA ENTRY AND CLICKS AND PRESERVES THE TEMP PASSWORD PRODUCED FOR THE ACCOUNT ONCE COMPLETE IT TAKES ALL THE TEMP PASSWORDS AND EXPORTS THOSE TO ANOTHER CSF IT ALL HAPPENS VERY FAST I'M SURE THERE ARE EVEN FASTER WAYS OF DOING IT BUT THIS IS HOW I'VE AUTOMATED IT SO FAR
REMINDME 2 DAYS

I LASTED SECONDS
WHY IS THIS SPECIFIC TO PYTHON NOT GOING TO DOWN VOTE YET BECAUSE I ONLY LASTED SECONDS AND MAYBE I'M MISSING SOMETHING
I WAS EXPECTING RAYMOND HETTINGER TALKING ABOUT PYTHONIC VS NON PYTHONIC

I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED
I AM GOING TO ATTEMPT REVIEWING THE VIDEO SINCE I KNOW THAT THE VIDEO PRODUCER SHIRA DOES PRODUCE SOME INTERESTING CONTENT SOMETIMES BUT ALSO TO SEE IF THERE'S BENEFIT IN WATCHING THIS I'M GOING IN WITH THE PREJUDICE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A GREAT VIDEO SINCE FROM WHAT I REMEMBER OF VIDEOS IN THE PAST HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE A THEORETICAL TYPE OF PERSON JUST MORE PRACTICAL THIS POST MIGHT ALSO THE BENEFIT OF OP AND OR FUTURE POSTERS TO HELP GLEAN WHY THIS CONTENT COULD BE INTERESTING IF ENOUGH PEOPLE AGREE WITH ME

A VIDEO DISCUSSING ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PROBLEMS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS STARTS WITH A SHOUT OUT TO ANOTHER YOUTUBER PERFORMING MAGIC NORMALLY SHOOTOUTS ARE FINE BUT THIS PARTICULAR SHOOTOUT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS PERSONALLY WHEN I WATCH A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE WITH INTERESTING CONTENT AND THE CONTENT PRODUCER RECOMMENDS ANOTHER CHANNEL I'M PRESUMING THAT THE OTHER CHANNEL IS A PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION BASED ON THE FACT THAT I LIKED THE CONTENT IN THE VIDEO I'M CURRENTLY WATCHING I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER PLUG ANOTHER CHANNEL UNLESS IT IS RELATED CONTENT BUT THE LACK OF SELF AWARENESS HERE IS OFF PUTTING AT THE VERY LEAST HE SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS A SHOOTOUT FOR A CHANNEL ABOUT MAGIC VIDEOS THE PERSON THAT MAKES THEM IS A GOOD FRIEND AND I WANTED TO GIVE THEM A SHOOTOUT EVERY THOUGH YOU AS A VIEWER ARE REALLY HERE FOR THE MATH ALSO WHY IS HE CLIMBING UP THE ROOF OF A BUILDING

EXAMPLES OF P NP PROBLEMS THAT HE PROVIDES AT ARE ALL ATTEMPT TO USE FOOTAGE FROM VIDEOS THAT HE MADE INSTEAD OF ACTUAL REAL WORLD PROBLEMS THAT MAKE THIS TOPIC INTERESTING

AT POLYNOMIAL IS MISSPELLED I MEAN COME ON THIS IS LITERALLY THE P IN P VS NP

HAS AN IMAGE ABOUT A BIKER FARTING BECAUSE OF BEANS I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT IS A JOKE IN PURE TASTE THERE'S NO REFERENCE TO THIS IN THE AUDIO PRESUMABLY HE ADDED IT WHILE EDITING TO MATCH HIM SAYING FAST WATCHING A FEW MORE SECONDS IT APPEARS THAT THE REST OF THE VIDEO WILL BE LITTERED WITH THIS SORT OF STUFF I'M GOING TO TRY NOT MENTION IT SINCE I'LL ATTEMPT TO TUNE IT OUT BUT IF THE VIDEO PRODUCER READS THIS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT LOW EFFORT LOW BROW LOW QUALITY JOKES CONSTANTLY THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO HAVE NO PLACE IN EDUCATIONAL CONTENTION THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT MAKING CONTENT FUNNY SO THAT IT'S MEMORABLE BUT THIS CLEARLY WAS AN AFTERTHOUGHT IN THIS PRODUCTION WHEN YOU HAPPEN TO ACCIDENTALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THEM THESE PARTICULAR JOKES ARE ANNOYING AND UNFORTUNATELY FORGETFUL SINCE THEY ARE RANDOM JOKES AS OPPOSED TO JOKES THAT ARE BASED OFF OF THE CONTENTION I CAN PROVIDE OTHER EXAMPLES OF YOUTUBERS THAT DO THIS WELL IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED

A TRAVELING SALESMAN ANIMATION WITHOUT A REFERENCE I REALLY WISH PEOPLE WOULD USE REFERENCES OR CITATIONS MORE THIS IS A PERSONAL PET PEEVE

OKAY HE'S ACTUALLY CODING UP A TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM IN PYTHON I'LL SEE WHERE HE GOES WITH THIS BEFORE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS

WHY A GLOBAL VARIABLE THIS CRITIQUE IS NOT ON THE CONTENT OF THE VIDEO I HAPPEN TO CATCH IT SINCE I'M PAUSING THE VIDEO TO CHECK WHAT HE'S DOING

HE SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED ONLY BY RECURSION FIRST BY EXPLAINING WHAT RECURSION IS AND THAT'S WHY IT IS SLOW HOWEVER RECURSION IS A SUBSET OF DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING AND HE MAKES NO MENTION OF THAT AGAIN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HIS TARGETED AUDIENCE IS NOT TECHNICAL

HE FINALLY MANAGES TO STUMBLE ON THE CORE IDEA BEHIND P VS NP

WELL HE SKIPPED OVER ALL TECHNICAL DETAILS WHILE SKIMMING AND NOT ONLY DID HE SAY VERY LITTLE BUT I BELIEVE HE STATED THE DEFINITION OF PROBLEMS INCORRECTLY HE OBVIOUSLY HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT SINCE ALL HE IS DOING IS LOOSELY DESCRIBING THE INTUITIONS ONE WOULD GARNER ON STUDYING P VS NP PROBLEMS IN MORE DETAILS I'M GUESSING HE READ WIKI TO UNDERSTAND WHY P VS NP EXISTS INSTEAD OF WHAT P VS NP MEANS

I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN FINISH THIS VIDEO AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS EVEN WORTH IT

I WENT AHEAD AND FINISHED THE VIDEO IT'S ACTUALLY A CHALLENGE TO GET THROUGH CONTENT LIKE THIS NOT ONLY WAS THE CONTENT INADEQUATE IN EXPLAINING THIS FAMOUS MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS ALSO INACCURATE

I HAPPENED TO CLICK THROUGH HISTORY BECAUSE I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE IF I COULD GAUGE WHAT SORT OF CONTENT HE LIKES AND MAYBE UNDERSTAND WHY HE LIKES THIS PARTICULAR VIDEO IT TURNS OUT OP IS THE VIDEO PRODUCER AND EVERY TIME HE POSTS SOMETHING HE SUBMITS IT TO EVERY RELATED SUBREDDIT HE USED A SMALL AMOUNT OF PYTHON IN THE VIDEO AND PROBABLY DECIDED TO SUBMIT IT HERE IT APPEARS HE'S DECIDED TO SUBMIT VIDEOS TO SUBREDDITS THE WAY I TAG MY STACKOVERFLOW QUESTIONS ISN'T SELF PROMOTION AGAINST THE RULES HERE ON REDDIN

U LLSOURCELL IT MUST BE FRUSTRATING TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING OFF OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS WHERE IT FEELS LIKE EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EYE CATCHING AND FUN OTHERWISE IT WON'T GET ANY ATTENTION I'M NOT ASKING THAT YOU DON'T MAKE VIDEOS LIKE THIS SINCE THEY MAY BE USEFUL FOR SOMEONE JUST GETTING INTO THE FIELD POSSIBLY A YEAR OLD WATCHING THIS WITH HIS FRIENDS MIGHT FIND SOME OF THE IMAGES AND REFERENCES TO HARAMBEE FUNNY I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT IS A DISSERVICE TO EVEN THEM BUT THAT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU PLEASE DON'T ATTEMPT SHOVING YOUR VIDEOS DOWN EVERYONE'S THROAT POSTING ON EVERY SUBREDDIT OR AT THE VERY LEAST POST ONLY WHEN YOU ARE PROUD OF THE CONTENT YOU PRODUCE ARE YOU PROUD OF THIS CONTENT I WOULD VENTURE TO GUESS NOT IT MAY RESULT IN A FEW MORE VIEWS BUT PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO USED TO WATCH SOME OF YOUR VIDEOS EARLY ON HAVE VERY LITTLE INCENTIVE TO NOW SUBSCRIBE TO YOUR CHANNEL
WHAT ON EARTH O
YES ASPREAD USES SHEETS API I NEEDED SOME FUNCTIONALITIES WHICH WAS NOT OFFERED BY SO WROTE PYGSHEETS THE BASIC INTERFACE IS SIMILAR TO ASPREAD WITH ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES LIKE BATCH UPDATES SHARING FROM TERMINAL PANDAS SUPPORT EXPORTING ETC ALSO SUPPORTS MORE FEATURES LIKE GRAPHS FORMATTING WHICH I HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED
OH SHIT GOTTA GIVE THIS A TRY IS THERE ANY FUNCTIONALITY THAT ASPREAD HAS THAT YOURS DOESN'T
IF MOST TUTORIALS OUT THERE COVER OPENCUT 2 THEN I THINK THAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD BENEFIT FROM MORE OPENCUT TUTORIALS

RATHER THAN UPDATING THE WHOLE BOOK AT ONCE YOU COULD CONSIDER WRITING A SERIES OF BLOG POSTS THAT ARE ROUGHLY ALIGNED WITH THE CHAPTERS FROM YOUR ORIGINAL BOOK THIS WOULD BREAK UP THE DAUNTING TASK OF UPDATING YOUR ENTIRE BOOK INTO MORE MANAGEABLE CHUNKS IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW YOU TO GET FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY SOONER YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE THE BLOG POSTS AND REFINE THEM INTO A MORE STRUCTURED BOOK LATER ON ONGOING INTEREST AND SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY MIGHT ALSO GIVE YOU MORE DRIVE TO CONTINUE WRITING THE BLOG POSTS AND HELP YOU ON YOUR WAY TO COMPLETING YOUR BOOK

JUST MY TWO CENTS HOPE THAT IT IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT
IF ALL THE LIBS YOU ARE COVERING ARE USABLE WITH PYTHON THEN STICK WITH THAT

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OPENCUT IF THERE AREN'T GOOD REASONS TO STILL USE FOR NEW PROJECTS I'D STICK WITH IF THERE AREN'T THAT MANY TUTORIALS ABOUT THAT WILL MAKE YOURS EVEN MORE VALUABLE

I WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY UNLESS IT DOESN'T NEED MUCH MORE THAN A FEW REMARKS
YEAH AS SOMEONE WHO USES OPENCUT AS A TEACHING EXAMPLE I CAN SAY THAT THE PYTHON TUTORIALS ARE STILL IN SHORT SUPPLY THOUGH TO BE FAIR IT WAS HARD GETTING OPENCUT TO WORK WITH PYTHON X BUT THAT WAS BACK IN NOW ANACONDA MAKES INSTALLING THE OPENCUT WRAPPER FOR X FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD I THINK UPDATING FOR X AND FOR OPENCUT WOULD BE A USEFUL RESOURCE
I WROTE GAME PROGRAMMING THE L LINE A FEW YEARS BACK IN PYTHON WITH PREGAME I HAVEN'T UPDATED THE BOOK AND DON'T REALLY PLAN TO BUT I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TEACHING PYTHON TO BEGINNERS WITH VERY FEW PROBLEMS

HONESTLY THE DYSFUNCTION WITHIN THE PUBLISHING WORLD IS THE MAIN REASON I MAY NEVER WRITE ANOTHER BOOK BUT HONESTLY THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY OVER PYTHON IS COMPLETELY SILLY TO ME

I ACTUALLY PREFER TEACHING TO BEGINNERS OVER 2 BECAUSE HONESTLY BEGINNERS SHOULD NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR LANGUAGE A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR BEGINNERS SHOULD TRY HARD TO GET OUT OF THE WAY

MOST BEGINNERS DON'T REALLY NEED TO KNOW OR CARE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES AND THEY ONLY ONES THEY'LL SEE ARE SIMPLE BUT OCCUR IN NEARLY EVERY PROGRAM

FIRST GETTING RID OF THE INSANELY DANGEROUS INPUT FUNCTION FROM AND RENAMING TO INPUT I LOVE THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM USING THAT OLD INPUT AT ALL

I LIKE THAT INTEGER DIVISION IS NOW EXPLICIT WITH THE AND THAT DIVIDING TWO INTEGERS WITH A SINGLE WILL PRODUCE A FLOAT LIKE THEY EXPECT I'LL TEACH ABOUT DATA COERCION AND ITS DANGERS ANOTHER DAY BUT THE FIRST WEEK OF PROGRAMMING DIVISION SIGNS SHOULD PRETTY MUCH DO WHAT THE USER EXPECTS

CHANGING PRINT FROM A STATEMENT TO A FUNCTION WAS A NECESSARY MOVE AND IT NEVER BOTHERS THEM BUT I STILL HAVE MOTOR MEMORY FROM YEARS OF PYTHON

OH AND THE CAPITALIZATION OF TINTER HAS CHANGED FROM A BEGINNER'S POINT OF VIEW NONE OF THIS MATTERS BECAUSE IT'S ALL NEW SILLY SET OF ARGUMENTS AS I'VE SAID

MY NEWEST VIDEO SERIES NO LONGER DOING BOOKS DOES COVER PYTHON IN THE BLENDER GAME ENGINE AND DOES USE AS THAT'S THE VERSION CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN BLENDER I'VE HAD NO REAL PROBLEMS


WILL BE THE YEAR OF PYTHON IMO BY IF YOU'RE STILL USING PYTHON 2 YOU WILL LIKELY BE IN THE MINORITY AND DUE TO LEGACY OR POLITICAL REASONS
PLEASE DO WHAT YOU FEEL BEST ZED SHAW HASN'T GOT THE FAINTEST IDEA WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS SELL AS MANY OF HIS BOOKS AS HE CAN BEFORE PEOPLE RELEASE WHAT A COMPLETE PRATT HE IS
YOU SHOULD REALLY NOT CARE ABOUT ZED SHAW HE HAS NO CLUE AND JUST MARKETS HIS ANGER

I THINK PYTHON IS THE WAY TO GO EVEN WHEN LIBS ARE STILL LAGGING BEHIND THEY'LL GET THERE EVENTUALLY OR SADLY DIE OUT ANYHOW
START BY CONVERTING YOUR BOOK TO PYTHON AND OPENCUT SELL IT AS A DIGITAL DOWNLOAD AND INCLUDE AS A FREE BONUS THE OLD VERSION FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED TO SUPPORT PYTHON 2

YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY TARGETING A DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS THAN ZED SHAW SO YOU CAN PROBABLY IGNORE HIS RANT ABOUT PYTHON 2 VS PYTHON
THE THOUGHT OF UPDATING IT FILLS ME WITH DREAD

UPDATE IT TO WORK WITH THE LATEST PYTHON 2 AND DO A SEPARATE VERSION FOR PYTHON
TRY STATEMENTS SHOULD BE SMALL BLOCKS OF CODE THAT MIGHT FAIL YOU REALLY ONLY TO WRAP THE OPEN IN A TRY CATCH

ANYTIME YOU FIND YOURSELF DOING THE SAME LINE OVER AND OVER YOU SHOULD RIGHT AWAY THINK IF YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF USING A LOOP

GIVEN THE FILE SIZE I'D ALSO CONSIDER READING THE WHOLE CONTENTS AND THEN WORKING WITH IT AS A LIST SINCE LISTS HAVE INDICES YOU CAN FIND THE FIRST LINE AND THEN START FROM THAT INDEX WITH PRINTING THE ENUMERATE FUNCTION WILL INCLUDE THE INDEX WHILE LOOPING THIS SHOULD GET YOU STARTED

I PAID ATTENTION OVER TEN YEARS AGO AND SAW THE FAIR FOREWARNING THAT PYTHON WOULD CONTAIN A FEW MINOR CHANGES SO I BEGAN THEN USING FEATURES TO MAKE MY 2 X CODE COMPATIBLE

I ALSO ENSURED MY CODE RESPECTED THE TRUE REPRESENTATION OF DATA SO IF IT WAS UNICODE TEXT I WOULD ENCODE AND DECODE INTO FROM BYTES AT I O BOUNDARIES I HAD TO ADVOCATE THIS POSITION IN A WORKPLACE WHERE THE CODEBASE WAS VERY MUCH WE'RE ALL BIT US ASCII AROUND HERE UNICODE IS HARD OF

I ALSO BEGAN REMOVING EXTERNAL LIBRARIES THAT WERE RECALCITRANT IN SUPPORTING THE TRANSITION TO PYTHON X AND ADVOCATING THE GENERAL USE OF ALTERNATIVES THAT WERE

AFTER PYTHON WAS RELEASED PEOPLE STARTED CREATING LIBRARIES LIKE SIX AND FUTURE NOTE NOT FUTURES THE CONCURRENT LIBRARY THE COMBAT ONE IS BY PYTHON CHARMERS WHICH WERE MORE CHEAPLY INTEGRATED THAN ESSENTIALLY DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING BY HAND DEPENDING ON THE CODE AT HAND I'D EITHER USE OR NOT USE THEM AS APPROPRIATE

THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INSANE HODGEPODGE THAT IS MOST CODEBASES PARTICULARLY THE MORE DEVELOPERS ARE WORKING ON THEM YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CODE UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENT AND MAKE GOOD CHOICES

AFTER PYTHON WHEN THEY SETTLED ON THE RIGHT WAY IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER TO PYTHON EVERYWHERE WHICH HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR THE PAST YEARS I FIND THIS TREND IN P2 V POSTS IN R PYTHON STRANGE AND CUTE

2 LIBRARY
HAVE YOU TRIED IT DO YOUR TESTS PASS
PEPI SIX
I'VE NOT HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS BUT IPLAN RECENTLY BOGGED ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE MIGRATING THEIR BACKEND CODEBASE

HETP HELPED ME A LOT THE AUTO CONVERSION DIDN'T WORK BUT WITH A LITTLE WORK THE CODE WORKS WITH PYTHON 2 AND THE RANDOM ERRORS THAT WILL DRIVE YOU MAD ARE STRING UNICODE BYTE ERRORS BUT FUTURE HELPED A TON WITH FIXING THEM WITH WORK DEFINITELY CHECK THEIR QUICK START GUIDE HETP

CEEVEE HAS A PRETTY EXTENSIVE FAQ ON THAT EXACT SUBJECT
I'D START BY READING PORTING PYTHON 2 CODE TO PYTHON
SMOOTHLY UPGRADE

NO SUCH LUCK
IN MY PERSONAL OPINION ANY PYTHON BOOK LIST THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE FLUENT PYTHON IS PURE GARBAGE
LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY

EHHHHHHHHHH
HMM SCRAPE INCLUDE AFFILIATE LINKS CLAIM AMAZING AI PROFIT
NO WEB DEVELOPMENT
I HAVE THE PYTHON POCKET REFERENCE IT'S OKAY BUT NOT THAT MUCH


I THINK THAT AURATED LISTS OF BOOKS ARE HUGELY USEFUL
SO I LINKED TO IT FROM MY AURATED LIST OF PYTHON ARTICLES

COMPREHENSIONS
IT'S DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE JUST ONE BUT ONE THING I REALLY MISS IN EAST G C IS ZIP AND ENUMERATE BECAUSE I USE THEM IN MY PYTHON CODE ALL THE TIME
IF I HAD TO PICK JUST ONE THING IT'S THE ITERATOR PROTOCOL I FIND FOR LOOP EXTREMELY INTUITIVE AND BEING ABLE TO HOOK INTO IT WITH NO FUSS IS FANTASTIC AND THEN THERE'S THE WHOLE SUITE OF THINGS THAT USE IT AS WELL
IMPORT THIS

ARE YOU THE AUTHOR OF THIS OR JUST A FAN OR A STUDENT
I WOULD SUGGEST TO CREATE A TICKET ON THEIR GITHUB PAGE SINCE YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM IN A VERY SPECIFIC PYTHON PACKAGE

A B COMBINE THE BITS OF A WITH THE BITS OF B FOR EXAMPLE IS SINCE IS AND IS WHICH GIVES AKA
JUST TO CLOSE THE LOOP ON THIS THE MOPY ISSUE I SUBMITTED WAS QUICKLY CLOSED BY CVR HIMSELF SAYING IT WAS A KNOWN BUG NOT IN MOPY BUT TYPEHEAD
THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW THE NRL STRUCTURE OF A WEBSITE BECAUSE IT'S ARBITRARY YOU CAN SPIDER THE SITE STARTING AT SOME PAGE AND FOLLOWING ALL LINKS UNTIL YOU STOP SEEING NEW BURLS OR GUESS BURLS RANDOMLY OR BASED ON SOME EXPECTED STRUCTURE BUT NEITHER OF THESE ARE PERFECT BECAUSE A SITE CAN STILL HAVE BURLS THAT ARE NOT LINKED FROM ANYWHERE AND OR HAVE UNGUESSABLE BURLS IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE FOR A SITE TO HAVE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF BURLS SINCE THEY CAN BY DYNAMIC THERE IS NO WAY TO DISCOVER SUCH A NRL WITHOUT GETTING LUCKY AND GUESSING IT OR EXHAUSTIVELY TRYING EVERY COMBINATION WHICH BECOMES INFEASIBLE VERY QUICKLY FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF LETTERS

IN OTHER WORDS WHILE SOME SITES MAY HAVE A SITE PAGE THAT LISTS THEIR ENTIRE HIERARCHY THAT'S BY NO MEANS NECESSARY AND BURLS ARE JUST ARBITRARY STRINGS THAT CAN BE ANYTHING AND THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL IF A NRL IS VALID WITHOUT MAKING A REQUEST FOR IT AND SEEING WHAT THE SERVER RESPONDS WITH AND IN ADDITION SOME BURLS WILL BE HIDDEN BEHIND FORM SUBMISSIONS AUTHENTICATION ETC SO IT'S EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT

THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO CRAWL THE SITE AND FIND ALL THE VALID LINKS THERE'S NO SIMPLE UNIVERSAL METHOD TO RETURN A DIRECTORY OF ALL AVAILABLE PAGES ON ANY WEBSITE WITHOUT CRAWLING THE SITE

THAT SAID THIS WOULD MORE THAN LIKELY DO THE TRICK

NO THERE ISN'T BECAUSE THAT IS NOT HOW BURLS WORK UNLIKE FILESYSTEMS HETP DOES NOT PROVIDE MEANS OF REQUESTING A DIRECTORY LISTING ALL YOU CAN DO IS REQUEST A DOCUMENT FROM A NRL AND THAT DOCUMENT CAN CONTAIN REFERENCES TO OTHER BURLS ENCODED ACCORDING THE CONTENT TYPE FOR EXAMPLE HETP CAN REFERENCE OTHER DOCUMENTS IN AND A FEW MORE TAGS

YOU HAVE THREE SOMEWHAT PRACTICAL OPTIONS HERE

OPTION BRUTE FORCE TAKE THE PARTS OF THE NRL YOU ALREADY KNOW THE PROTOCOL DOMAIN AND THE STRING WEATHER AND THEN ENUMERATE ALL THE POSSIBILITIES FOR THE REMAINING PARTS FOR EACH POSSIBILITY ISSUE AN HETP REQUEST IF IT RETURNS OK YOU HAVE FOUND THE TARGET IF IT'S A NOT FOUND KEEP SEARCHING OF COURSE YOU WILL BE HAMMERING THE TARGET SITE WITH WHAT WILL LOOK EXACTLY LIKE SOME SORT OF DOS ATTACK OR SOME OTHER MALICIOUS ACTIVITY SO I ACTUALLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS OR YOU MIGHT GET BLACKLISTED

OPTION 2 CRAWL START AT THE SITE ROOT PARSE THE HEML EXTRACT ALL USEFUL LINKS AND RECURSIVELY CRAWL THOSE SKIP THE BURLS YOU HAVE VISITED BEFORE THIS WILL GIVE YOU A TREE OR IF YOU FLATTEN IT A LIST OF ALL THE BURLS IN THAT SITE THAT ARE REACHABLE FROM THE SITE ROOT IF THERE'S A USING THAT AS YOUR STARTING POINT WILL PROBABLY BE VERY HELPFUL AND SPEED THINGS UP A LOT

OPTION USE GOOGLE WITH A SEARCH QUERY LIKE SITE WEATHER SERIOUSLY GOOGLE HAS PRETTY MUCH DONE OPTION 2 FOR YOU ALREADY MIGHT AS WELL USE THEIR INDEX
AS WELL AS WHAT THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SAID SOME WEBSITES ALSO AT LEAST SOME OF THEIR VALID BURLS WITH A SITEMAP CHECK THE FILE FOR ANY SITEMAPS AND IF THEY HAVE ONE YOU CAN TRY AND CHECK IN THERE FOR ANY LINKS MATCHING YOUR INTEREST

THE SITEMAPS AREN'T GUARANTEED TO SHOW ALL BURLS THE WEBSITE WILL SERVICE THOUGH AS IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO A WEBSITE TO CREATE THEIR OWN SITEMAPS HOWEVER THEY WISH
IF IT IS GETTING DELETED ON A SIMPLE REBOOT RESTART THAN YOU HAVE SOMETHING VERY VERY ODD GOING ON I WOULD BE TEMPTED TO DIAGNOSE THAT ISSUE FIRST
ONE WAY TO MAYBE TO WORK ROUND YOUR ISSUE WOULD BE TO USE A VIRTUALENV MAYBE USE VIRTUALENVWRAPPER TO MAKE THINGS EASY AND ALWAYS INSTALL THE MODULES YOU NEED INTO A SPECIFIC VIRTUALENV FOR YOUR PROJECT SINCE VIRTUAL ENDS EXIST UNDER YOUR HOME DIRECTORY SYSTEM THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE UNINSTALLED BY WHATEVER IS MESSING WITH YOUR SYSTEM ON REBOOT
IF THE MODULE DISAPPEARS FROM USR LOCAL THEN YOU SHOULD INVESTIGATE THAT IF IT DOES NOT DISAPPEAR BUT IS STILL NOT AVAILABLE AFTER A REBOOT PERHAPS YOUR PATH IS NOT CORRECT UPON REBOOT IN THIS CASE THERE ARE VARIOUS METHODS FOR SETTING THE PATHOLOGY OTHER POSTERS RECOMMEND VIRTUALENV REGARDLESS OF YOUR OTHER ISSUES YOU SHOULD BE USING THIS TO ISOLATE YOUR APPLICATION FROM THE SYSTEM INSTALLED DEPENDENCIES
I'M THE MODERATOR WHO REMOVED IT AS A RESOURCE I DID NOT DO IT FOR ANY POLITICAL AGENDA IT WAS JUST YEARS OUT OF DATE AND THERE WERE BETTER RESOURCES FOR AVAILABLE I RIGHTLY DID NOT IMAGINE THIS WOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT ON SALES AND ALSO IMAGINED INCORRECTLY THAT HE WOULD NOT CARE EITHER WAY IF HE WANTS TO UPDATE STUFF OR HAVE ME ADD IT BACK IN THAT WOULD BE FINE IT WAS REMOVED THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR AGO
WOW THE MODERATORS SURE DIDN'T SHOW ZED THE AUTHOR OF THE MOST POPULAR BEGINNER RESOURCE FOR PYTHON WOW

ZED IS SUCH A BIG BOY FIGHTING AGAINST THE PYTHON ILLUMINATI

TO PUT IT BLUNTLY THE REDDIN COMMUNITY RESPONSIBLE FOR TEACHING BEGINNERS TO CODE CENSORED MY BOOK AS A POWER PLAY TO GET ME TO FORCE PYTHON ON UNSUSPECTING BEGINNERS

CENSORED NOT RECOMMENDING SOMETHING IS CENSORSHIP NOW


I DECIDED I NEEDED TO WORK OUT A LIST OF REASONS WHY PYTHON IS BROKEN FOR BEGINNERS AS OF TODAY ORIGINALLY I WAS GOING TO WRITE IT BUT THEN I WROTE A BLOG POST ABOUT HOW THE ILLUMINATI IS ATTACKING PYTHON SO I CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF WITHOUT MAKING SUBSTANTIAL POINTS

NICE

WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT WHAT A BUNCH OF ANGRY LONELY CODERS THINK ABOUT MY THOUGHTS BECAUSE I SURE AS HELL DON'T CAN'T YOU TELL

NICE

THE CODER ILLUMINATI MADE NODE JS POPULAR AND THEN WANTED TO UPDATE CODE AND CONVINCE EVERYONE THAT ITS OKAY THEY ARE SCARY BECAUSE THEY ARE UNINFORMED AND HAVE NO HUMANITY AND FOR SOME REASON A VC FORUM HAS INFLUENCE OVER VCS

NICE

THIS ILLUMINATI HAS NO INFLUENCE NOW DON'T KNOW WHY I'M STILL BITCHING ABOUT THEM THEN BUT WHATEVER THEY ARE SO BAD LIKE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL EVEN THOUGH I LUMPED THEM IN WITH THE FOLKS AND HAS BEEN WIDELY SUCCESSFUL ALSO PYTHON AND OPENSSL ARE ALL THE SAME GROUP OF PEOPLE

NICE



I'LL GIVE A PIZZA TO ANYONE WHO CAN CONVINCE ALEX JONES TO RUN THIS AS A LIBERAL ATTACK ON AMERICA'S TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE
BEING SOMEONE WHO HAS SERVED OVER A MILLION BEGINNER PROGRAMMERS I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS A BEGINNER THAT WAS CONFUSED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT FUNDAMENTALLY IF THEY WERE ON PYTHON 2

I'VE NEVER FELT THAT FOR A BEGINNER THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PYTHON 2 AND PYTHON OTHER THAN SOME SYNTAX CHANGES THE REAL DIFFERENCES DON'T SHOW UP UNTIL A BIT DOWN THE ROAD AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT CHALLENGING AT ALL

I'M STILL CONVINCED THAT JUST DOING THIS FOR THE PUBLICITY OF COURSE HIS SALES ARE MOMENTARILY UP WITH ALL THIS DRAMA LET'S SAY A NEW PEOPLE HAVE COME ACROSS HIS CONTENTION MAYBE OF THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST THERE TO SEE HOW STUPID IT ALL IS BUT MAYBE ARE SYMPATHETIC AND ARE CONVINCED HE'S RIGHT THAT'S STILL NEW PEOPLE

DRAMA IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS AND HE'S MILKING IT
I'M KIND OF CONFUSED OF WHY THE 2 VS DEBATE IS STILL CONTINUING DO SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT EVENTUALLY PYTHON WILL BE CANCELLED AND WE'LL ALL GO BACK TO 2

AND HIS RESPONSE SEEMS KIND OF JUVENILE I MEAN THE BASIC TONE OF THIS IS YOU ARE ALL A BUNCH OF LONELY CODERS AND YOU DON'T MATTER BECAUSE MY SALES HAVEN'T BUDGED

I GET THAT HE FEELS THAT PYTHON DOESN'T MAKE FOR AS GOOD OF A TUTORIAL BUT REGARDLESS WHY NOT TEACH TO THE FUTURE OR HECK HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS BUT THEN AGAIN A SUBREDDIT CAN ALSO DECIDE THAT IT WOULD RATHER RECOMMEND A DIFFERENT BOOK WHY PUT THIS DOWN AS SOME SORT OF FASCIST CENSORING MADE BY A TRIBAL COMMUNITY OF STRONGLY IMPLIED AMATEURS
HOLY SHIT THAT GUY IS A COMPLETE TWAT
EVERYONE I DON'T AGREE WITH ARE CODE ILLUMINATI

A GUIDE TO PROGRAMMING DISCUSSION

ACTS LIKE A CONDESCENDING MAN CHILD WRITES A BOOK FULL OF ANGRY OPINIONATED ANECDOTES

DUE TO THIS BOOK IS REMOVED FROM RECOMMENDED SIDEBAR

REPLIES TO CRITICISM BY WRITING AN ANGRY CONDESCENDING ARTICLE

YEA REDDIN IS THE PROBLEM ZED REMEMBER WHEN THAT GUY POINTED OUT MISTAKES IN LEARN JAVA DO YOU WROTE AN ARTICLE RIPPING HIM A NEW ONE
HIS MAIN PROBLEM IS HIS RELIANCE ON THE PREMISE THAT PYTHON IS SOME SORT OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED AS SUCH

THE LANGUAGE IS PURPOSEFULLY SIMPLE BUT ITS MAIN PURPOSE IS NOT TO EASE THE WAY FOR BEGINNERS IT'S TO BE EFFECTIVE AND PYTHONIC FOR REAL PROGRAMMING A NICE SIDE EFFECT OF THIS IS THAT IT'S EASIER TO RAMP BEGINNERS UP WE SHOULD NOT HOBBLE THE LANGUAGE TO MAINTAIN THAT
IS HE REPEATEDLY GOING THROUGH HIS OWN CODE AND HE'S A BEGINNER WHO ONLY KNOWS PYTHON 2 AND MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES ABOUT STRINGS EVEN THOUGH HE KNOWS BETTER THEN USING THAT AS RECONFIRMATION THAT PYTHON SUCKS

WHAT A LUNATIC
I'M LAZY CAN SOMEONE LINK TO THE RELEVANT THREADS WHERE SHAW FEELS HE'S BEING ATTACKED CENSORED ABUSED AND BELITTLED I'VE SEEN THE MAN MOVE FROM RUBY TO PYTHON BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE RAILS RUBY COMMUNITY WAS TOXIC AND NOW HE SAYS THE SAME THING ABOUT THE PYTHON COMMUNITY I'M TRYING TO MAKE UP MY MIND OF SHAW IS A THIN SKINNED PRIMADONNA OR IF HE ACTUALLY HAS A POINT

I HAVE READ HIS STUFF SO I KNOW HE'S OBJECTIVELY WRONG ABOUT A BUNCH OF THINGS LIKE THE TURING COMPLETENESS BULLSHIT DISSING BUT THAT MEANS HE DESERVES TO BE CORRECTED NOT INSULTED
BUT AT THE SAME TIME WERE HORRIBLY UNINFORMED ABOUT BASIC COMPUTER SCIENCE

SAYS THE GUY WHO CLAIMS PYTHON IS NOT TURING COMPLETE
I THINK ONE OF BIG COMPLAINTS IS ABOUT STRINGS IN PYTHON AND THAT THEY ARE TOO DIFFICULT TO USE FOR A BEGINNER DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM IS
HE SAYS THAT PYTHON ISN'T GOOD FOR BEGINNERS BUT HIS OWN BOOK IS TERRIBLE FOR BEGINNERS WHICH IS THE REAL REASON WHY IT WAS REMOVED FROM OUR SIDEBAR
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF HE'S PLAYING DUMB OR DOESN'T GET IT
HE SAYS
I GET AN EMAIL FROM SOMEONE WHO TELLS ME THAT REDDIN HAS DECIDED TO REMOVE MY BOOK FROM THEIR LIST OF SUGGESTED READINGS FOR PYTHON UNTIL I UPDATE THE BOOK TO PYTHON

LIKE REDDIN WAS AN ENTITY OF ITS OWN BY OMITTING THE SPECIFIC SUB HE MAKES A CLAIM THAT IS UNCHECKABLE ALSO IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY REMOVED THE BOOK FROM THE SUGGESTED MATERIALS TWO WEEKS AGO
THEY MADE THIS DECISION ABOUT TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO WHEN I RECEIVED THE EMAIL

AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND R LEARNPYTHON MODS DECIDED YESTERDAY

OH GOOD ANOTHER RANT FROM ANGRY NERD I'M GUY CAN'T WAIT TO READ THIS GEM
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE HIM MONEY BY VISITING HIS SITE IF HE'S JUST TROLLING FOR CLICKS WHAT'D HE SAY ABOUT TURING COMPLETENESS OR DID HE NOT MENTION HIS FUCKUP IN THIS POST
MAN IS TOLD HIS WORK IS OBSOLETE PITCHES OLD MAN FIT FILM AT
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY REDDIN CENSORED MY BOOK

SOMEONE TEACH THAT MAN WHAT CENSORSHIP IS
WIKI CENSORSHIP
I TEACH PYTHON TO MIDDLE SCHOOLERS ON THE SIDE I HAVE INSISTED ON PYTHON BECAUSE THERE'S NO POINT IN MUDDYING THEIR MINDS WITH BY THE TIME THEY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL PYTHON 2 WILL HAVE BEEN

THE REALITY IS THAT YES WE CAN HAVE DEBATES ABOUT WHETHER PYTHON MADE THE RIGHT CALL AND WHETHER PIPY IS THE FUTURE OF PYTHON INSTEAD OF PYTHON BUT PYTHON DOES SEEM TO BE THE PYTHON VERSION WITH THE BEST NAME RECOGNITION AND WIDEST ADOPTION

IF ZED SHAW WANTS TO BE ANOTHER ABE SIMPSON LET HIM I'VE TAKEN THAT MANUSCRIPT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON HALFHEARTEDLY FOR YEARS NOW AND UPDATED IT TO PYTHON ALREADY BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO


OLD MAN SHOUTS AT CLOUD
HONESTLY ALL OF HIS COMPLAINTS ARE JUST EXCUSES FOR HIS LAZINESS HIS REAL PROBLEM ARE THE UNICODE STRINGS AND ERROR MESSAGES IN PYTHON ARE YOU AIDING ME WE GOT FINALLY RID OF THE UGLY GLOBAL ERROR AND HAVE NOW THE NAME ERROR SOMETHING EVEN BEGINNERS CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND AND THE WHOLE UNICODE THING IS HE SO IGNORANT TO UNDERSTAND WE NEED A CODEC FOR THE WORLD BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE JUST CAN'T US ASCII ALONE

I AM FROM EUROPE AND I HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALOT OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ALL DAY AND TO BE HONEST THE STANDARD UNICODE IN PYTHON SAVES ME ALOT OF TIME

HE DIDN'T EVEN UPDATE HIS TUTORIAL SERIES TO AND HE IS ARGUING ABOUT SOME BULLSHIT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE REAL DEATH THREATS
AND SOME BULLSHIT ON HIS PERSON

AND THE TALKING ABOUT HIS PAINTINGS ARE JUST THERE TO GIVE HIM SOME KIND OF PERSONALITY I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT IS USELESS CRAP SO HE CAN TRY TO CONVINCE US TO BE AN ACTUALLY BARRING PERSON BORING FRITTING TRICK

ESPECIALLY HIS INTERNATIONAL CRITIQUE SHOWS ME THAT ZED IS JUST AN ARROGANT AND LAZY WANKER NOTHING MORE FUCK HIM REALLY
FFS CAN WE GIVE IT A REST THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS NOW AS WAS HIS INITIAL POST DO WE HAVE TO CARE ABOUT WHAT ONE GUY BE IT ZED SHAW SAYS
SEEMS LIKE HE IS TRYING TO BE CONTROVERSIAL TO GET MORE SALES HE IS CLEARLY VERY CONCERNED WITH HIS SALES AND TRAFFIC AS HE MENTIONS IT MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE ARTICLE HE EVEN ADMITTED THE ARTICLE HAS GOTTEN HIM A SURGE IN SALES IN THAT EFFORT HIS ARTICLE WAS A MARKETING COUP D'ETAT
I SAW ZED SHAW AT A GROCERY STORE IN SAN FRANCISCO YESTERDAY I TOLD HIM HOW COOL IT WAS TO MEET HIM IN PERSON BUT I DIDN T WANT TO BE A DOUCHE AND BOTHER HIM AND ASK HIM FOR PHOTOS OR ANYTHING

HE SAID OH LIKE YOU RE DOING NOW

I WAS TAKEN ABACK AND ALL I COULD SAY WAS HUH BUT HE KEPT CUTTING ME OFF AND GOING HUH HUH HUH AND CLOSING HIS HAND SHUT IN FRONT OF MY FACE I WALKED AWAY AND CONTINUED WITH MY SHOPPING AND I HEARD HIM CHUCKLE AS I WALKED OFFICIAL WHEN I CAME TO PAY FOR MY STUFF UP FRONT I SAW HIM TRYING TO WALK OUT THE DOORS WITH LIKE FIFTEEN MILKY WAYS IN HIS HANDS WITHOUT PAYING

THE GIRL AT THE COUNTER WAS VERY NICE ABOUT IT AND PROFESSIONAL AND WAS LIKE SIR YOU NEED TO PAY FOR THOSE FIRST AT FIRST HE KEPT PRETENDING TO BE TIRED AND NOT HEAR HER BUT EVENTUALLY TURNED BACK AROUND AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE COUNTER

WHEN SHE TOOK ONE OF THE BARS AND STARTED SCANNING IT MULTIPLE TIMES HE STOPPED HER AND TOLD HER TO SCAN THEM EACH INDIVIDUALLY TO PREVENT ANY ELECTRICAL INFETTERENCE AND THEN TURNED AROUND AND WINKED AT ME I DON T EVEN THINK THAT S A WORD AFTER SHE SCANNED EACH BAR AND PUT THEM IN A BAG AND STARTED TO SAY THE PRICE HE KEPT INTERRUPTING HER BY YAWNING REALLY LOUDLY
REALLY IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON
THIS GUY IS WHY PROGRAMMERS HAVE A TERRIBLE REP IN SOCIETY AT LARGE
WHY IS THERE STILL VS DEBATE IS IT LIKE D D VS A NERD BATTLE OR SOMETHING


CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN


FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND LEGACY CODE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE SOON SO SUPPORT FOR IS NEEDED BUT IS THE NEW VERSION AND SHOULD BE THE WAY TO GO FOR NEW THINGS
DELETED
PRETTY REASONABLE ARTICLE
VERY COOL I HAD SIMILAR STRUGGLES WHEN LOOKING UP INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES LIKE VOLKSWAGEN AND ALL THE TICKERS THEY HAVE THAT BEING SAID I FEEL LIKE MORE ACCESSIBLE DATA INSIGHT THAT JUST A GENERAL SCORE WOULD BE HELPFUL LIKE MAYBE EXPLAIN THE METHODOLOGY AND THE WEIGHT GIVEN TO EACH ESTIMATE UNLESS YOU DID SOMEWHERE AND I TOTALLY MISSED IT JUST TO MAKE THIS USEFUL AND PRACTICAL HOWEVER THIS IS ALREADY SUPER COOL AND VERY DIFFERENT FROM EXISTING TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUT THERE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK AND HOPEFULLY YOU ATTRACT LIKE-MINDED INVESTORS
IF I TYPE PRI INTO YOUR SEARCH ENGINE I GET PRIMERICA AS CHOICE SO YOU MAY WANT TO CHANGE YOUR YAHOO FINANCE EXAMPLE AND OR YOUR IMPLEMENTATION
IMPRESSIVE TOOL AND A BIG NEED FOR YOUNGER INVESTORS
HEARING ABOUT YOUR TECH DESIGN STRATEGY WOULD BE INTERESTING EVERYONE SOMEONE BUILDS AN ENGINE THEY REMAKE WHEELS SOMETIMES WITH A NEW BIT OF GENIUS

I DOUBT YOUR STARTUP WILL MAKE MORE MONEY CUSTOMERS AS A RESULT OF THE DESCRIPTION BUT IT COMES THEN THANKS

ALSO WHERE CAN WE FILE SUGGESTIONS WITHOUT FILLING THAT ENTIRE FORM YOUR COHORT ANALYSIS IS WEAK IN THE AREAS I FREQUENT EAST G SCF IS A COHORT OF ALLY INSTEAD OF THE ENTITIES THAT YOU SOMETHING ASSOCIATE AND ALL ARE FROM CIT VISA ETC ALSO YOU DON'T INDEX ADB AT ALL

YOU DO REALISE THAT THERE ARE MILLION COMBINATIONS RIGHT IT'S HIGHLY TO TRY ALL OF THEM

ALSO LOOK AT THE FUNCTION
THIS ISN'T SPECIFIC TO THE API YOU NEED TO GET A LIST OF FILES AND SEARCH BY EXTENSION AND PUT THE ONES WITH THAT EXTENSION ON A LIST GRAB EVERYTHING ON THAT LIST
ARE YOU GETTING ANY ERRORS WHEN YOU RUN THAT CODE WHAT DOES THE ERROR MESSAGE SAY
IT'S WELL ARGUED BUT IT'S ALSO FIVE YEARS OLD HE ACTUALLY WROTE A BLOG POST JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WHERE HE MAKES SOME REFLECTIONS ABOUT THIS

HERE'S AN EXCERPT

BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT YOU DISLIKE ARMIN RONDACHER NOV 5TH



IN FACT I MYSELF CAMPAIGNED FOR SOME CHANGES TO PYTHON THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE BETTER PORTS LIKE THE REINTRODUCTION OF THE U PREFIX ON UNICODE STRING LITERALS AND THE BULK OF MY LIBRARIES WORK ON PYTHON FOR MANY YEARS NOW IT'S A FACT THAT IN THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH PYTHON ARE DIFFERENT THAN THEY USED TO HAVE BEFORE

THIS LEADS TO VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS WHERE I CAN HAVE A HIGHLY TECHNICAL CONVERSATION ABOUT A VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE WITH PYTHON AND THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY OR DEAL WITH IT LIKE SOME OF THE LESS OBVIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF THE NEW TEXT STORAGE MODEL AND ANOTHER PERSON JOINS INTO THE CONVERSATION WITH AN ARGUMENT AGAINST PYTHON THAT HAS LONG STROPPED BEING VALID WHY BECAUSE THERE IS A COST TOWARDS PORTING TO PYTHON AND A CHANCE IS NOT SEEN THIS MEANS THAT A PERSON WITH A GENERAL NEGATIVITY TOWARDS PYTHON WOULD SEEK ME OUT AND TRY TO REAFFIRM THEIR OPPOSITION TO A PORT TO IT

I AM TRYING TO DO THIS PROBLEM THAT'S WHY I AM DOING THIS

AND WHEN I PASS IN REVERSED TRUE GIVE


GOING THROUGH ARTICLE I CAN'T TELL IF HE'S PURPOSEFULLY BEING STUPID OR IF HE'S A FACTORY REJECT CAST ASIDE FROM COMMON SENSE

A BYTEARRAY IS NOT A STRING YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO THROW THOSE TOGETHER BYTEARRAYS ARE FOR BYTES

AS SOMEONE THAT LIVES IN A COUNTRY WHERE COMMON NAMES HAVE CHARACTERS NOT INCLUDED IN ASCII FUCK OFFICIAL
CONFER ZED CASE AGAINST RUBY ON RAILS
TWITTER IS ACTUALLY
THE FACT HE KEPT REFERRING TO STRINGS AS STATICALLY TYPED IN PYTHON IS JUST ONE OF MANY HILARIOUS THINGS ABOUT POST

THIS IS A REALLY GOOD REBUTTAL
ALL I KNOW IS THAT OCCASIONALLY WHEN I AM GOOGLING AROUND LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS TO SOME CODE I AM WORKING ON I SEE SOME SNIPPINESS ABOUT HOW THE OP REALLY SHOULD BE USING PYTHON DID NOT REALIZE THERE WAS A WAR GOING ON



I'M SURPRISE IT TOOK ZED THIS LONG FROM HIS RAILS IS A GHETTO RANT THAT'S HOW ZED IS NOTHING IS EVER HIS PROBLEM PYTHON IS ALL PROPAGANDA BUT LET ME JUST VAGUELY USE INCOHERENT MUMBO JUMBO TO FEAR YOU FROM USING IT
THE PYTHON EFFORTS TO CONVINCE YOU TO START WITH PYTHON ARE NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST BUT RATHER ARE ONLY IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PYTHON PROJECT

THIS MAKES SENSE NOT SAYING IT'S OBJECTIVELY CORRECT WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BUT THAT I TOTALLY GET THAT AS A REASON

BUT THEN

ASK YOURSELF WHY ARE THEY SO KEEN ON HAVING YOU USE A LANGUAGE THAT HAS ONLY ABOUT ADOPTION IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND FULL OF ISSUES

I'D LIKE TO SEE THE SAME ADOPTION METRICS FOR NODE VS ECMASCRIPT TO ETC USING THE LOGIC HE'S USING HERE

AND THEN I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MAKES PYTHON ANY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER LANGUAGE I'M BETTING THAT ANYONE INVOLVED IN AN ECOSYSTEM WOULD SAY THAT IT IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND FULL OF ISSUES

IOW I DON'T THINK THE STATED PROBLEMS ARE ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER MODERN LANGUAGE IT'S EASY TO STAND IN THE WALLED GARDEN AND DECRY PYTHON IS BUSTED
I DIDN'T LIKE THE LACK OF BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY AND AM STILL A LITTLE ANNOYED BY THE CAVALIER ATTITUDE BEHIND THAT CHOICE BUT ZED ARGUMENTS ARE THIN AND SHRILL
HE'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT PYTHON ERRORS COULD AND SHOULD GIVE THE VARIABLE NAMES

THE PROBLEM WITH HIS ARGUMENT IS THAT PYTHON 2 SUCKS IN THIS REGARD IN THE EXACT SAME WAY
WHILE I AGREE BROADLY THAT THE PYTHON CORE DEVS HAVE SCREWED THE POOCH WITH AND ARE IN NO HURRY TO CLEAN UP THE MESS THEY'VE MADE I HONESTLY CAN'T AGREE WITH A SINGLE ONE OF HIS ARGUMENTS HELL MANY OF HIS ARGUMENTS AGAINST ARE THINGS I CONSIDER ARGUMENTS FOR

I DON'T BELIEVE HIS STAT BUT I ALSO DON'T BELIEVE STATS THEY'RE BASED ON PYCHARM USERS WHICH ISN'T EXACTLY A MAJORITY OF PYTHON DEVS WHAT'S MORE THE STATS ARE DOMINATED BY WEB DEVELOPERS WHICH IS A GROUP FOR WHOM IS UNQUESTIONABLY BETTER THEY ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY SHIELDED FROM S PROBLEMS BY THE FRAMEWORKS THEY'RE USING WHOSE DEVELOPERS HAVE DEALT WITH S SHITSHOW FOR THEM AND BY THE FACT THAT WEBAPPS RUN IN ENVIRONMENTS

S CHANGES ALSO HAVEN'T KILLED PYTHON BUT THEY HAVE KILLED PYTHON FOR A CERTAIN CLASS OF PROGRAM FOR WHICH IS EMINENTLY SUITABLE NAMELY UNIX PROGRAMS AND OTHER STUFF

S FUNDAMENTAL VS IMO IS THAT IT NOT ONLY INSISTS ON TREATING ALL TEXT AS UNICODE WHEN WE STILL LIVE IN A WORLD FULL OF STRINGS OF UNSPECIFIED ENCODING BURLS HETP EMAIL UNIX FILENAMES BUT IS SO FUNDAMENTALIST ABOUT IT IT JUST DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE TOOLS TO WORK WITH ENCODED STRINGS OR UNDO ITS MAGIC DECODING WHEN IT'S PICKED THE WRONG ENCODING

WHAT I THINK IS KILLING PYTHON IS THAT THE CORE DEVS ARE STICKING TO THE GIL WHICH MAKES PYTHON 2 OR A SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN IN A WORLD WHERE EVEN SMARTWATCHES ARE

IMO THE CORE PYTHON DEVS DEFINITELY FUCKED UP IN MAKING INCOMPATIBLE WITH WITHOUT OFFERING ANY SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS IF YOU HAVE WORKING CODE THERE REALLY ISN'T A LOT TO BE GAINED BY PORTING THIS HAS BEEN IMO THE MAJOR REASON FOR THE SLOWNESS OF ADOPTION AMONGST SEASONED DEVS

IS A MUCH MORE LANGUAGE BUT OFFERS AT BEST TRIVIAL BENEFITS FOR EXPERIENCED CODERS AND IS IN MANY CASES A TOTAL PITA

SO ZED MIGHT BE RIGHT IN THAT REGARD IN THAT DEVELOPERS FACED WITH THEIR PROJECTS TO SUPPORT MAY WELL DECIDE THERE'S BASICALLY BUGGER ALL BENEFIT IN WORKING CODE FOR WHEREAS IN SAY GO MAY BRING A X SPEED-UP PLUS THE ABILITY TO USE MULTIPLE CORES

CERTAINLY AS SOMEONE WHO MOSTLY CODES THE PROGRAMS THAT IS UNSUITED FOR I'M STARTING A LOT OF NEW PROJECTS IN GO SEEING AS MY WEAPON OF CHOICE HAS BEEN BOLED

THE UNIX COMMAND LINE IS BASICALLY BYTES S TEXT MODEL IS ALSO THE POSIX TEXT MODEL SO IT JUST WORKS WITH OTHER POSIX TOOLS LIKE FIND OR GREP YOU HAVE TO FIGHT ALL THE WAY TO GET CORRECT POSIX BEHAVIOUR

IS ALSO LARGELY INSENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENT SETTINGS AND WILL KEEP ON CHUGGING IN SITUATIONS WHERE DIES IN FLAMES LIKE ASHING TO A MACHINE THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT THE LOCALE SET ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE
TWO DAYS I HEAR ABOUT ZED SERIOUSLY YOU NEED TO STOP FEEDING THE TROLL
THE STRINGS IN PYTHON ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO USE FOR BEGINNERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THEIR STRINGS MORE INTERNATIONAL THEY TURNED THEM INTO DIFFICULT TO USE TYPES WITH POOR ERROR MESSAGES EVERY TIME YOU ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH CHARACTERS IN YOUR PROGRAMS YOU'LL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BYTE SEQUENCES AND UNICODE STRINGS

TO BE HONEST THIS IS ALREADY TRUE IN PYTHON I CAN'T EVEN TELL HOW MANY TIMES I'VE HAD MYSTERIOUS ERRORS BECAUSE I TRIED USING UNUSUAL CHARACTERS
WHAT WORLD IS ZED LIVING IN
OW NO NOW HE WILL HAVE TO WRITE A PYTHON IS A GHETTO RANT THE GUY ACTS LIKE A ROCK STAR THE TYPE OF COLLEAGUE THAT ONLY WANTS TO WIN A CONVERSATION AND PRETEND TO BE LOGICAL BUT ONLY REACT IN EMOTIONAL WAYS
MY REASON FOR STICKING WITH IS THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO USE AT WORK IS STARTING TO GET BAKED INTO VARIOUS DISTRIBUTIONS BUT UNTIL IT'S AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE BY DEFAULT IS THE ONLY CHOICE FOR ME

I AGREE WITH SOME OF ARGUMENTS PARTICULARLY THE STRING HANDLING MESS BUT ARGUING YOU SHOULDN'T ADOPT IT BECAUSE THE DEVS ARE PUSHING IT SEEMS A LITTLE CIRCULAR

YEAH I JUST USE BOTH
MY ONE REAL GRIPE ABOUT PYTHON LATELY IS HOW SORTING CHANGED

SO SAY I HAVE A LIST OF SOME CUSTOM OBJECT THAT I CREATED THAT CAN'T MEANINGFULLY BE SORTED BY SORT OR SORTED IN PYTHON 2 I'D WRITE A SHORT FUNCTION THAT DOES THE COMPARISON AND PASS IT AS AN ARGUMENT TO THE SORTING METHODS ABOVE IN I'M APPARENTLY SUPPOSED TO OVERRIDE UP TO SIX METHODS IN THE CLASS AND HOPE THAT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SORT MY OBJECTS THERE'S A WORKAROUND WHERE YOU CAN INSTEAD USE A SHORT LAMBDA BUT THAT REALLY DOESN'T SEEM IDEAL

HONESTLY THE OLD WAY DIDN'T SEEM BROKEN TO ME WHY WAS IT FIXED THIS WAY


DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE PYCHARM
I'M JUST LEARNING PYTHON AND DID NOT KNOW THERE WAS A NERD WAR GOING ON

PERSONALLY I THINK I AM JUST GOING TO USE THE LATEST VERSION HATE ME FLAME ME ALL YOU WANT

I THINK THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CODERS WHO ARE UNWILLING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT THING IF IT WERE UP TO SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WE WOULD STILL BE USING ASSEMBLY OR PUNCHED CARDS

I HAVE HAD A FEW PROBLEMS LEARNING USING THE LATEST VERSION PAYT FOR EXAMPLE BUT THE DOCUMENTATION WAS THERE AND THERE IS ALWAYS GOOGLE
I GOT THROUGH ABOUT HALF OF THIS ARTICLE BEFORE DECIDING YEAH THIS GUY JUST WENT FULL RETARD HE'S VERY CLEARLY THE SAME SORT OF PERSON WHO MIGHT FOR EXAMPLE HANG OUT IN A C FORUM AIMED AT BEGINNERS AND CONSTANTLY GO VIM AND THE COMMAND LINE IS ALL YOU NEED IDES ARE FOR MORONS HE'S THE SORT OF PERSON WHO LEGITIMATELY BELIEVES THAT PROGRAMMING SHOULD BE UNNECESSARILY HARD AND INACCESSIBLE SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF BEING HARD AND UNNECESSARILY INACCESSIBLE BECAUSE FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON HE THINKS THAT THE ABILITY OF ONE TO HANDLE THAT IS A LEGITIMATE MEASURE OF THEIR CHARACTER
ZED BOOKS ARE GREAT AND HE'S GREAT AT WHAT HE DOES BUT AFTER FOLLOWING HIM FOR A BIT ON TWITTER ITS HARD NOT TO CONCLUDE THAT HE'S A BIT OF A HAIR PULLING WILDMAN
EXACTLY THE KIND OF TRASHING THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE NEEDED THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULDN'T GO FULL MCINTOSH SPITTING CURSING AND RATIONALIZING

ZED ASKED FOR IT AND NOW ALL HIS BASE ARE BELONG TO LEXY
ZED REALLY DIDN'T NEED TO GO PAST HIS POOR DESIGN DECISIONS PREVENT ADOPTION SECTION PYTHON NOT MAINTAINING BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY WITH STANDARD PYTHON WAS A HUGE MISTAKE
THIS ZED GUY IS PROBABLY STUCK WITH A GIANT MESS OF A LEGACY PYTHON 2 CODEBASE AND FEELING ALONE AND LEFT BEHIND
I FIND THE ADOPTION NUMBER HARD TO BELIEVE

I'M LOOKING FOR WORK AND HAVE NOT HAD ONE EMPLOYER EITHER IN PERSON ON THE PHONE OR IN AN ONLINE POSTING MAKE ANY MENTION OF PYTHON
YOU COULD USE PYTHON 2 UNTIL IT DIES OR YOU COULD USE PYTHON WHICH MIGHT DIE WHAT A CHOICE
BY SOME DEFINITIONS PYTHON 2 IS ALREADY DEAD

THEY'RE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER BY ACCOUNT A LIVING LANGUAGE IS USED AND DEVELOPED IN SHE IGNORES THIS RATHER OBVIOUS DEFINITION FOR SOME REASON

BUT THIS IS NOT STATIC TYPING THAT S STRONG TYPING

SEMANTICS IRRELEVANT ONCE YOU GO HERE YOU'RE LOOKING DESPERATE NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR DEBUNKING OF YOUR MISUNDERSTANDING OF AN ARGUMENT YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANS

THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO SILENTLY PRODUCE NONSENSE IN SOME CASES

THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO PRODUCE OUTPUT THIS GOES AGAINST THE WHOLE DUCK TYPING PHILOSOPHY PYTHON WAS BASED ON OR YOU KNOW YOU COULD READ THE ARTICLE AND SEE THE ALTERNATIVE HE SUGGESTS WHICH COULD PROVIDE AN ERROR IN THE CASE THE DTF CONVERSION COULD NOT HAPPEN

HOW WOULD PYTHON EVEN REPORT THIS ERROR WHEN I USED LITERALS INSTEAD OF VARIABLES

GEE MAYBE PRINT THE FUCKING LITERAL

WHY DO YOU HAVE A TEXT STRING AND A BYTESTRING IN THE FIRST PLACE

BECAUSE LIBRARIES ARE GARBAGE

I COULD SWEAR ZED AN EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER JUST SAID HE COULDN T EASILY FIGURE OUT THESE NEW FORMATTING SYSTEMS

NO HE SAID IT WAS STUPID TO HAVE TO TEACH THREE TO A BEGINNER

WHAT CONSTANT CHANGING STATUS THE LANGUAGE MAKES NEW RELEASES IS THAT BAD

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE AND PROGRAM BREAKING CHANGES YOU KNOW THE THING YOU ENCOUNTER WHEN YOU ACTUAL USE THE DAMN THING STARTING TO SUSPECT SHE DOESN'T BY THE WAY

SHE'S DONE AMAZING WORK THROUGH OUT AT MISSING THE POINT AND BEING CONDESCENDING SHE IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING SHE RAILS AGAINST IT'S SO EASY TO ARGUE AGAINST A DERANGED READING OF AN ARTICLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY TACKLE THE REASONS BEHIND THE WRITING OF ONE WHICH IN THIS CASE IS THE FUCKING FRUSTRATION OF DEALING WITH PYTHON AND THE UNNECESSARY CHANGES THEY'VE MADE FOR FUCKING LANGUAGE PURITY

I RATHER HER ZED SHAWS OUT OF 2
WELL RESPONSE IS JUST WHAT ZED EXPECTED NO SURPRISE
YOU HAVE NO SCALY MODULE THAT WORKS IN FORGET IT I PROGRAM ON THE STACK IF YOU CAN'T ACCOMMODATE I'M NOT INTERESTED
DELETED
THE LIST TO STRING METHOD USES RATHER THAN

IS INTENDED AS UNAMBIGUOUSLY TELLING YOU WHAT THE OBJECT IS AND IS HUMAN READABLE

EG IF YOU HAVE TWO JOHN SMITH RUNNER OBJECTS YOU CAN TELL WHICH ONE IS WHICH WITH

YOU CAN EITHER IMPLEMENT THE OF RUNNER OR WRITE AN ITERATOR TO LOOP THROUGH THE LIST AND PRINT YOURSELF
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO PROVIDE AN ACTUAL TESTCASE AND PREFERABLY A REDUCED TESTCASE I EAST REMOVE EVERYTHING EXTRANEOUS WHAT HAVE YOU ACTUALLY WRITTEN FOR YOUR METHODS IN BOTH CLASSES THAT OUTPUT WOULD INDICATE THAT YOU'RE MISSING A METHOD FOR THE RUNNER CLASSICAL


I MUST CONCEDE THAT I HAVEN'T TRIED YOUR PROGRAM YET BUT I LIKE THE IDEA QUITE A LOT

WHERE DO YOU PLAN TO GO FROM HERE

I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IT COULD BE DESIGNED TO BE MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN AN ALIAS MANAGER FOR TEXT FILES AS IT STANDS YOU ARE BASICALLY CREATING A PROGRAM THAT SETS ALIASES FROM A LIST WHENEVER IT IS RUN AND PROVIDES AN INTERFACE FOR UPDATING THAT LIST YOUR PROJECT LOOKS VERY NICE BUT TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST I DON'T SEE THE ADVANTAGE THIS REALLY HAS TO SIMPLY MAKING A BASH SCRIPT THAT IS RUN ON STARTUP WITH A LIST OF ALIAS ASSIGNMENTS IT EVEN SAVES A STEP WHEN CALLING THE FILE UP TO BE EDITED AS I COULD JUST SAY FOR EXAMPLE VIM AS OPPOSED TO CFM EDIT

SINCE PACKAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS TEND TO PROVIDE RECORDS FOR CONF FILE LOCATIONS YOU CAN PROBABLY USE THE PACKAGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY AUTOMATE THE IMPORT OF CONF FILES FROM THERE USERS COULD ADD CUSTOM LOCATIONS OR FLAG FAVORITES TO CREATE A AURATED LIST IF THAT IS YOUR MAIN GOAL HOWEVER I THINK AUTOMATING THE IMPORT OF CONF FILES DURING SETUP WOULD BE THE EXPECTED AND APPRECIATED BEHAVIOR

ADDITIONALLY WHILE YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH THE PACKAGE MANAGEMENT AND FILE SYSTEMS YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET ADDITIONAL DATA THAT YOU MAY WANT TO USE TO ADD NEW FEATURES FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD

COLLECT THE NAME OF THE PACKAGE MAINTAINER TO DISPLAY AS METADATA ALONG WITH THE PACKAGE TITLE
2 TRY TO LOCATE CONF FILES THAT HAVE BEEN ORPHANED BY PACKAGES THAT WERE INSTALLED UNINSTALLED USING THE PACKAGE MANAGER
USE CHECKSUM FROM INSTALLATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CONF FILE HAS BEEN MODIFIED SINCE INSTALLATION
RESTORE THE ORIGINAL CONFIT FILE FROM THE PACKAGE BY UTILIZING THE PACKAGE MANAGER ITSELF
MANAGE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE PERMISSIONS ON THE FILE RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT USER AND THE PROGRAM IT BELONGS TO

LASTLY CONCERNING YOUR OVERALL DESIGN OF USING THE ALIASES

DOES THIS NOT PREVENT USING THE NAME OF THE APPLICATION ITSELF AS THE ARGUMENT DESIGNATING THE CONF FILE BEING EDITED

FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMAND CFM EDIT FOO WHERE ALIAS FOO FLOOR IN MANY CASES FOO WOULD BE THE NAME OF THE EXECUTABLE ITSELF AND SETTING THE ALIAS WOULD POLLUTE YOUR SHELL AS TO PREVENT CALLING TO THE EXECUTABLE I THINK MAYBE I'M WRONG AND YOU PREVENT THAT FROM OCCURRING SOMEHOW REGARDLESS MY HUMBLE OPINION IS THAT IT IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE TO EDIT THE CONF FILE JUST BY CALLING THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF AS THE ARGUMENT

2 THIS MAY NOT BE THE BEST DESIGN FOR THE SORTS OF FEATURES YOU MAY WANT TO ADD IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL IF THE PROGRAM COULD MANAGE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF A CONF FILE AND PROVIDE AN INTERFACE FOR SWAPPING YOU COULD EVEN CREATE GROUPS OF CONF FILES ACROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE SWAPPED AT ONCE USEFUL FOR DEPLOYING CUSTOMIZATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS MUX VIM EMACS ETC WHILE EACH PROGRAM WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT METHOD FOR LOADING CONF FILES YOU COULD CONTROL WHICH FILE IS LOADED BY DEFAULT FOR ANY PROGRAM BY RELOCATING THE CONF FILES FOUND ON SETUP TO A CENTRAL DIRECTORY AND THEN CREATING SYMBOLIC LINKS IN THE DEFAULT DIRECTORIES

I THINK THAT THE PROGRAM NEEDS TO STORE ALL OF THE DATA FOR A PARTICULAR CONF FILE IN SOME KIND OF DATABASE OR SIMPLE LIST OF RECORDS AND THEN HANDLE THE ARGUMENT CONTAINING THE APPLICATION NAME BY LOOKING IT UP INTERNALLY RATHER THAN CALLING TO AN ALIAS THAT HAS BEEN SET EXTERNALLY

PROJECT GOT ME THINKIN BOUT SOME STUFF AND SOME THINGS

EDIT JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT THE ABOVE WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS SINCE IT RELIES ON SPECIFIC PACKAGE MANAGERS YOU'D LIKELY NEED TO TREAT EVERY PACKAGE MANAGER AS SPECIAL AND IN GENERAL ANY FILE SYSTEM OPERATION IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT ON WINDOWS

HOWEVER I SUGGEST NOT TRYING TO BE CROSS PLATFORM FOR A PROJECT LIKE THIS IT IS PLATFORM SPECIFIC MOST TOOLS OPERATING IN THIS SPACE ARE NOT CROSS PLATFORM

IF THIS RELEASES ON SCHEDULE I'LL LIKELY BE TEACHING MY WINTER PROGRAMMING CLASS IN SINCE IT'S A CLASS FOR NOVICES THE CHANGE THAT WILL IMPACT ME THE MOST IS THE

AS A LONG-TIME RUBY PROGRAMMER I'M A FAN OF A MORE CONCISE WAY OF INTERPOLATION AND AM CONSIDERING TEACHING THIS AS THE CANONICAL WAY OF DOING INTERPOLATION VS FORMAT THOUGH KNOWING ABOUT FORMAT MAY MAKE UNDERSTANDING THINGS LIKE JINJA TEMPLATING EASIER TO ROK
CHRISTMAS IS COMING EARLY THIS YEAR I CAN'T WAIT FOR MY NEW FAVOURITE F TOY
TOO BAD THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT IN TIME FOR STRETCH FREEZE
CIRC I HEARD THAT THE DICTIONARIES BEING ORDERED BY DESIGN MAY NOT MAKE IT IN THE ACTUAL RELEASE OF ANYONE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
HAVE YOU CONFIRMED THAT YOU HAVE AN UP TO DATE JAVA IMPLEMENTATION ON YOUR SYSTEM
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULDN'T IMPORT THINGS BECAUSE THEY MIGHT DEPEND ON THINGS AND SO ON AND YOUR COMPROMISE IS TO DO LOCAL IMPORTS WHICH WILL LOAD THE DEPENDENCIES INTO ANYWAYS BUT THIS JUST ENDS UP OBSCURING YOUR MODULE'S DEPENDENCIES
IS IMPORTING ACTUALLY A PROBLEM FOR MOST CASES THOUGH WILL IT AFFECT ANYTHING OTHER THAN AND MEMORY USAGE I AM MOSTLY USING PYTHON FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT WHERE NEITHER IS A HUGE ISSUE IS IT REALLY AN ISSUE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

THE PROPOSED SOLUTION OF DELAYING IMPORTS SEEMS A BIT ERROR PRONE IMAGINE A LONG RUNNING REPORT SCRIPT THAT CRASHES AT THE END BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT YOU FORGOT TO INSTALL TERMCOLOR OR SOME OTHER OUTPUT PRETTIFIER

I AM A BIT CONFUSED BY

WELL THE MOST STANDARD WAY IS NOT PUTTING THE IMPORTS IN THE TOP-LEVEL SCOPE JUST USE LOCAL IMPORTS AND TRY TO KEEP YOUR PUBLIC API SIMPLE SIMPLE APIS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN COMPLEX APIS

DOES IT MATTER IF I HAVE THE IMPORTS DEEPER DOWN IN THE LIBRARY WHEN I IMPORT FROM THOSE FILES IN MY TOP LEVEL SCOPE WHICH I ASSUME IS MY MAIN PY WILL DEPENDENCIES NOT BE IMPORTED ANYWAY
GOOD QUESTIONS I'LL LIKE TO KNOW TOO
PROJECT
DO YOU NEED A SPECIFIC PYTHON ENVIRONMENT

I'VE USED CHOCO WITH PYTHON AND IT WORKED OUT PRETTY WELL
SUCCESSFULLY USED IN THE PAST CIRC I HAD TO INSTALL DECODE ITSELF SEPARATELY
I WOULD DO A SIZE CHECK BEFORE ANY HASHING
JOBS WHERE YOU PRIMARILY WRITE IN ONE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND THAT LANGUAGE IS PYTHON YES THERE ARE MANY WHICH SHOULD BE EASY TO VERIFY WITH A QUICK LOOK AT JOB SITES

THERE'S PLENTY OF GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THIS AT R LEARNPROGRAMMING AND R CSCAREERQUESTIONS

I DON'T THINK THERE IS SUCH A WEB API CALL

THE UNDERNAME IS ONLY USED FOR LOGIN
I WAS WILLING TO GIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT UNTIL THE PART WHERE SHAW CLAIMS PYTHON IS NOT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD SAY SOMETHING SO DEMONSTRABLY FALSE
AFTER READING BOTH ARTICLES I'M TOTALLY BEHIND CEEVEE HERE

SERIOUSLY FUCK ZED HIS ARTICLE IS NOT JUST A CRITICISM OF PYTHON WHICH IS TOTALLY FINE I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO READ CRITICISM OF PYTHON IT HELPS ME LEARN MORE IT'S A VERY DECEPTIVE SLOPPY I'M ACTUALLY AT THE POINT WHERE I THINK I SHOULD PETITION THE MODERATORS OF R LEARNPYTHON TO REMOVE BOOK FROM THE WIKI I WOULD HATE FOR A BEGINNER TO BE TURNED OFF PYTHON JUST BECAUSE OF HIS DUPLICITOUS STATEMENTS ABOUT IT

ALSO IT IS SO ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT ZED HAS NEVER USED ANYTHING ABOVE ASCII MY ENTIRE JOB IS DEALING WITH CHARACTERS AND I WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLY CRIPPLED IF I WAS STUCK WITH PYTHON 2


ZED SHAW YOUR BEHAVIOR HERE IS FUCKING REPREHENSIBLE JEEZE THIS IS MY FIRST FLAME WAR SINCE STARTING CODING
I ONLY WRITE PYTHON AT WORK I ONLY DO PYTHON FOR MY NEW PERSONAL PROJECTS AND MOST OF THE OLDER ONES HAVE DROPPED PYTHON 2 I ONLY WRITE PYTHON 2 FOR THE OSS PROJECTS THAT I CONTRIBUTE TO

IN MY OPINION PYTHON 2 CAN'T DIE SOON ENOUGH
I ONLY LEARNED PYTHON AND I THINK IT IS A GOOD LANGUAGE
IN CASE YOU GUYS MISSED IT AS I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY OF YOU MAY ALSO BE C CODERS BUT ZED SHAW IS THE GUY WHO SAID THAT THE K R C BOOK WRITTEN BY THE CREATORS OF C KERNIGHAN AND RITCHIE HAD EXAMPLES IN IT THAT WERE COMPLETELY UNSUITABLE AND UNSAFE AGAIN HE CITES STRING HANDLING AS HIS EXAMPLE HE HAS SOME ISSUES WITH STRINGS THIS CHAP

YOU CAN SEE C RANT HERE TIM HENTENAAR PICKED APART HIS C BOOK HERE WITH FOCUS IN PART ON THE RANT ITSELF MAKES INTERESTING READING IF YOU'RE A C PROGRAMMER OR HAVE AN IDEA WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT

LONG STORY SHORT ZED IS AN ARROGANT ARSEHOLE
BY THE WAY ANYONE LOOKING FOR AN ACTUAL CRITICISM OF PYTHON BY A VERY WIDELY AND WELL RESPECTED MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY RESPONSIBLE FOR A NUMBER OF THE MOST POPULAR LIBRARIES OUT THERE SHOULD LOOK TO THIS BY ARMIN CONCHER



EDIT AS THE TOP REPLY TO THIS POINTS OUT HERE'S A QUITE RECENT BLOG FROM THE SAME AUTHOR ABOUT THE DANGERS OF GROUP THINK

AS IT RELATES TO PYTHON I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT HIS CURRENT OPINION OF PYTHON IS COMPARED TO EAST G
INCOMING RANT

SO I'VE ONLY KNOWN PYTHON FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF I STARTED OUT DOING KIRK PYTHON FOR NETWORK ENGINEERS CLASS SEEING AS WELL I'M A NETWORK ENGINEER HE TEACHES THE CLASS USING PYTHON 2 I HOWEVER DECIDED THAT I WOULD DOWNLOAD INSTALL AND TAKE THE CLASS IN PYTHON BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY OF THE FUTURE RIGHT

THROUGHOUT THE CLASS I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT PYTHON 2 AND PYTHON HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES HOWEVER WHENEVER I RAN INTO A PROBLEM I WAS ONLY A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH AWAY FROM THE ANSWER THIS PROCESS FORCED ME TO LEARN THE TERMINOLOGY OF THE LANGUAGE AND WHAT IT WAS ACTUALLY DOING UNDER THE HOOD RATHER THAN JUST THE SURFACE LEVEL MY CODE MATCHES HIS BUT DOESN'T RUN ATTITUDE THAT ZED SEEMS TO HOLD

THIS PROCESS WAS A GREAT LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND IT MADE ME A BETTER PROGRAMMER IN MY USE CASE I RAN INTO THE TYPING ERRORS QUITE A BIT AS MOST OF MY STRINGS CAME FROM SOCKETS AND WEREN'T FORMATTED IN A WAY I COULD USE

I GUESS MY BOTTOM LINE IS THIS PYTHON 2 AND PYTHON ARE DIFFERENT AND THEY HAVE TO BE BUT THEY'RE NOT THAT DIFFERENT GET OVER IT ZED

GOOD JOB ON THE ARTICLE CEEVEE
PYTHON IS GREAT EVERY TIME I SEE PRINT DECLARATIONS WITHOUT BRACKETS I DIE A LITTLE INSIDE
I LIKE CEEVEE AND THIS IS A GREAT REBUTTAL BUT DOES ANYBODY TAKE THIS GUY ZED SHAW SERIOUSLY HONEST QUESTION
ANYWAY I ENJOYED READING POST IT'S FUN AND INFORMATIVE SO THANKS FOR SHARING
I AGREE WITH THE ARTICLE IN THE C WORLD EVERYBODY HAD TO TAKE A STEP BACK SOME TIME AGO WHEN WE REALIZED THAT WE COULDN'T DO EVERYTHING WITH CHAR BUT INSTEAD HAVE TO START USING ACTUAL STRINGS BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS NOT IN ASCII ANYMORE THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE THAT CLING TO TO USING CHAR EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS YET MOST PEOPLE HAVE APPRECIATED THE NEW LIBRARIES EVEN IF THEY DID HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS

THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR STILL SEEMS STUCK IN THE PAST WHERE EVERYTHING IS THOUGHT OF AS BYTE STREAMS AND OTHER FUNDAMENTAL TYPES COMPUTERS AND SOFTWARE IS MORE COMPLICATED NOW AND PYTHON HAS CHANGED TO WRAP UP THIS COMPLICATION AND PROVIDE A BETTER FOUNDATION TO BUILD UPON THIS IS A GOOD THING BUT IT IS CHANGE I WOULD THINK YOU'D WANT TO RECOMMEND TO NEW PEOPLE TO USE STRINGS AS STRINGS AND TO QUIT DOING THE WEIRD TYPE CONVERSIONS
TIL ZED SHAW IS AN ASSHOLE

I DON'T KNOW THIS ZED GUY BUT THE ONLY THING I AGREE WITH HIM ABOUT IS THAT IT WOULD REALLY BE NICE IF PYTHON SHOWED THE VARIABLE NAMES IT COULD NOT CONCATENATE IN ERROR MESSAGES INSTEAD OF JUST THEIR TYPE
I STARTED SLOWLY LEARNING PYTHON WITH LPTHW 2 YEARS AGO LAST YEAR I RAN INTO A TON OF ISSUES TRYING TO MAKE MY FIRST PROJECT IN PYTHON 2 BECAUSE ALL THE FILES I NEED TO PROCESS USE DTF

I'M GLAD I SWITCHED TO PYTHON BEFORE GETTING TOO ACCUSTOMED TO PRINT FORMAT AND UNICODE ARE WONDERFUL IMPROVEMENTS FOR ME AND I HEARD THAT DCTS WILL SOON BE ORDERED BY DEFAULT GLORIOUS
PYTHON WAS AN INSIDE JOB HTTPS
I CAN'T BELIEVE ZED SHAW IS STILL BEING SHARED AROUND THESE PARTS I GUESS THAT JUST SHOWS YOU THAT POSITIVE WORD OF MOUTH WILL BE EFFECTIVE NO MATTER WHAT THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT IS

EDIT JUST ACTUALLY READ THE ARTICLES IT SEEMS THAT HE HAS UPGRADED FROM NOT JUST DISLIKING THE LANGUAGE TO FORMING CONSPIRACY THEORIES JESUS
CURRENTLY YOU CANNOT RUN PYTHON 2 INSIDE THE PYTHON VIRTUAL MACHINE SINCE I CANNOT THAT MEANS PYTHON IS NOT TURING COMPLETE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANYONE

YIKES
I HONESTLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CONVERSATION IS STILL A THING I USE PYTHON DAILY IN MY WORK AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS WITH IT

IT'S TRUE THAT UNTIL YEARS AGO THE COLLECTION OF AVAILABLE MODULES WAS A BIT LACKING BUT FROM MY EXPERIENCE I THINK THIS ISSUE HAS GONE BEYOND IT'S TIPPING POINT I REGULARLY NEED TO ADD NEW REQUIREMENTS IN MY WORK AND VERY RARELY ENCOUNTER A MODULE THAT ISN'T COMPATIBLE EVEN WHEN IT ISN'T THERE'S USUALLY WORKAROUNDS IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO YOU CAN JUST COMPILE THE MODULE USING COTHON AND YOU'LL GET A SPEEDUP FOR FREE WITHOUT DOING CHANGES APART FROM THE COMPATIBILITY FOR THE RECORD I'VE NEVER REACHED THE POINT WHERE THIS WAS NECESSARY

I USE PYTHON PRETTY MUCH JUST TO BE PROPER I'VE HEARD THAT IT'S MARGINALLY FASTER THE UNICODE SUPPORT IS NICE AND IT DOES HAVE SOME NEW SHINY FEATURES THAT ARE PRETTY USEFUL BUT OTHER THAN THAT

IN ANY CASE BOTH VERSIONS ARE BARELY DIFFERENT FOR MOST DAY-TO-DAY WORK AND SPECIALLY FOR BEGINNER WORK OTHER THAN THE PRINT THING AND ITERATING OVER DCTS A VAST MAJORITY OF CODE IS COMPATIBLE FOR BOTH VERSIONS I REALLY DON'T GET THE PHRASE TEACHING PYTHON IT'S THE SAME THING THEY ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE A BEGINNER CAN TRIVIALLY WRITE PYTHON AFTER JUST READING AND INTRODUCTORY PYTHON 2 BOOK THE ONLY FACTOR THAT AVOIDS THIS IS THE ACTUAL BOOK SAYING NOT TO USE PYTHON BECAUSE IT'S INFERIOR

ADDITIONALLY NOWADAYS THERE'S GOOD TOOLS THAT MAKE WRITING CODE COMPATIBLE FOR BOTH VERSIONS TRIVIAL WHICH IS WHAT MOST IMPORTANT LIBRARIES DO
THANKS FOR OUTLINING THIS IN SUCH A COMPLETE REBUTTAL

I AM SLIGHTLY AT A LOSS FOR FIGURING OUT WHY EXACTLY ZED HAS DECIDED TO DOUBLE DOWN HERE AS WELL AS POST SUCH AN ARTICLE I AM FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE HE'S BUYING WHAT HE'S SELLING

I AM TORN BETWEEN HIM SIMPLY DOUBLING DOWN FOR HIS SAKE AND HIM GOING WITH THE ANY PRESS IS GOOD PRESS JUST TO GET HIS NAME BOOK SITE BACK INTO THE SPOTLIGHT

I AM INCLINED TO THINK THIS IS PURELY AN ATTEMPT TO DRIVE SOME TRAFFIC SURE A LOT OF THE TRAFFIC WONT BE SYMPATHIZERS BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THEM HE'LL SURELY GET SOME NEW TRAFFIC

DRAMA IS GREAT BUSINESS IT'S JUST UNFORTUNATE WHAT IT DOES TO THE COMMUNITY
REALLY NICE POST

SERIOUSLY I'M A BIT FED UP WITH PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT PYTHON THEY SHOULD SPEND THIS PRECIOUS TIME ACTUALLY LEARNING IT THIS WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE

AND HONESTLY HOW BIG OF A LEAP IS THERE BETWEEN PYTHON 2 AND PYTHON WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO LET'S SAY PYTHON 2 AND JAVA OR PYTHON 2 AND SHOULDN'T THIS BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE MOST PYTHON 2 PROGRAMMERS TO SWITCH TO PYTHON
AS A BEGINNER I HAD NO PROBLEMS TRANSLATING A MAJORITY OF MY PYTHON CODE FROM 2 X TO X MY CODE IN MY OPINION IS STILL PRETTY BASIC BUT I'VE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH EITHER PYTHON THAT I COULDN'T ATTRIBUTE TO MY OWN IGNORANCE INSTEAD OF THE LANGUAGE ITSELF

SERIOUSLY THOUGH HOW DO I SUBSCRIPT THE UNSUBSCRIPTABLE
CURRENTLY YOU CANNOT RUN PYTHON 2 INSIDE THE PYTHON VIRTUAL MACHINE SINCE I CANNOT THAT MEANS PYTHON IS NOT TURING COMPLETE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANYONE

ZED OH ZED

I NEVER REALIZED YOU WERE STUPID ENOUGH TO WRITE SOMETHING THIS DUMB
SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLY ZED DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE
SO SHOULD I START LEARNING AND STOP LISTENING TO ZED I'VE BEEN DEBATING THE SWITCH FOR A WHILE NOW AND ZEDS CURMUDGEONESS HAS BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE SO MAYBE I SHOULD STOP LISTENING TO HIM
I ORIGINALLY LEARNED C AND PYTHON FROM ZED

HAVE HAD TO RELEARN EVERYTHING WITH K R AND FLUENT PYTHON RAMALHO CANNOT RECOMMEND THAT SECOND BOOK ENOUGH

THE TROUBLE I FIND WITH STUFF AFTER LEARNING THINGS PROPERLY IS THAT HE DOESN'T TRY TO ACTUALLY GET THE LEARNERS TO UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE AND WHY CONSTRUCTS EXIST IT'S VERY MUCH AN APPROACH OF I WANT TO DO THIS THING AND THIS IS HOW I CAN DO IT IN THIS LANGUAGE RATHER THAN TAKING THE TIME TO SHOW THE LANGUAGE'S PARTICULAR STRENGTHS

FOR EXAMPLE WHICH CHAPTERS OF HIS BOOK EXPLAIN ABCS PROPERTIES THE DATA MODEL GENERATORS OR ANYTHING THAT MAKES PYTHON GOOD

AND SURE PYTHON 2 IS GREAT PROVIDED YOU DON'T THINK ARE INTERESTING OR YOU LEGITIMATELY THINK HAVING TO DECLARE SOMETHING AS INHERITING FROM OBJECT EVERY TIME IS THE IDEAL

ANYWAY FUCK THIS GUY
ZED IS DEAD
I STARTED USING PYTHON FOR MY PERSONAL PROJECTS BUY I AM NOT GOING TO REWRITE MY OLD CODE AT WORK JUST BECAUSE IT'S A BETTER LANGUAGE AND IN AT LEAST TWO BIG LIBRARIES WE DEPEND ON OPENCUT AND PANDA 3D DON'T HAVE PREGUILT PYTHON BINARIES FOR WINDOWS AND I PREFER TO HAVE AN EASY WAY TO GET THINGS RUNNING ANYWHERE
PYTHON IS A HUGE ONE UP TECHNICALLY UP ON MY ROOM MATE USES AND WHENEVER WE TALK PYTHON IT USUALLY ENDS UP WITH ME PREACHING ABOUT ASYNCHRONOUS COMPREHENSIONS NEUMS AND SMALL DCTS
WHAT MAKES ME UPSET WITH ONE OF THE POINT IS THAT WE SHOULD ONLY USE ASCII FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS LEARNED SEVERAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES I ALWAYS HATED ASCII BECAUSE IT WAS USED IN THE AND AND WAS A PAIN IN THE BUTT TO USE WITH LANGUAGE THAN ENGLISH IT WAS QUITE HAPPY TO LEARN THAT UNICODE WAS INVENTED TO INTRODUCE OTHER LANGUAGES THAN ENGLISH IN A COUNTRY WHERE ENGLISH AND FRENCH ARE BEING USED ON A REGULAR BASIS THIS MAKES PROGRAMMING EASIER NOW THAN IN THE PAST

AS FOR THE PRINT FUNCTION I DON'T SEE THE PROBLEM WITH TAGGING 2 PARENTHESES TO PRINT A SET OF CHARACTERS MOST OF THE EDITORS WILL DO IT AUTOMATICALLY FOR YOU EVEN THE PRINT FUNCTION IN C USES PARENTHESES AS WELL WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL

I STILL USE PYTHON 2 RIGHT NOW BUT I WILL SWITCH OVER TO PYTHON AS MOST MODULES THAT I USE HAVE SWITCHED OVER I COULD BRING OTHER SUBJECTS IN THE DISCUSSION BUT I LIKE THE WAY PYTHON IS GOING WITH UNICODE
CURRENTLY YOU CANNOT RUN PYTHON 2 INSIDE THE PYTHON VIRTUAL MACHINE SINCE I CANNOT THAT MEANS PYTHON IS NOT TURING COMPLETE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANYONE

IT HAVE TO BE A TROLLING
BY AGE ALONE AT THIS MOMENT IF YOUR SOFTWARE ISN'T COMPATIBLE WITH PYTHON IT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF SOFTWARE THAT WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH PHS A SIMILARLY BIG UPDATE THAT INTRODUCED A LOT OF INCOMPATIBILITY IN

EIGHT YEARS ARE ENOUGH TO LEARN HOW TO UPDATE YOUR CODE
STRINGS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE

THEY ARE SO YOU COME UP WITH A STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH THEM SET YOUR ENCODING AT THE BOUNDARY OF YOUR CODE AND STOP TOUCHING IT

BETTER ERROR MESSAGES WOULD BE GREAT BUT I'D RATHER HAVE HORRIFIC ERROR MESSAGES AS OPPOSED TO AUTOCONVERTING MADNESS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO FIX PYTHON 2 CODE USING JUST PYTHON 2 IF YOU ONLY THROW A UNICODE CHARACTER THROUGH A FUNCTION OF THE TIME

I LIKE HOW EASY PYTHON 2 IS BUT STRINGS ARE BROKEN IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO FIGURE OUT MY DATA FILES ARE NOT IN DTF BUT RATHER LATIN THEY ARE NOT COMPATIBLE

WHO REALLY USES BYTES ANYWAYS NOT BEGINNERS THEY JUST SET AN ENCODING AND THEY'RE DONE YOU CAN JUST PRETEND YOUR DATA IS ALWAYS IN SAY LATIN OR DTF AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO WORK ON AN ASCII STRING BYTES ARE A HIGHER LEVEL FEATURE PEOPLE JUST GOT USED TO USING WB BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT STUPID R CHARACTERS AT THE END OF THE LINE

TOO MANY FORMATTING OPTIONS

WHY WOULD I EVER USE FORMAT IT'S WORSE THAN S AND SLOWER THERE ARE NOW 2 METHODS IN MY BOOK AND THAT I CAN USE BECAUSE I WRITE PYTHON CODE
I AM NOT SURE WHAT THEIR EAST G THE AUTHOR'S ISSUE IS PYTHON DEVELOPERS DECIDED TO PUSH FORWARD WITH PYTHON TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE OTHERWISE THEY DO IT MAINLY FOR FREE AND I THINK THE EFFORT SHOULD BE APPRECIATED NOW BUSINESSES AND COMPANIES WHO USE TOOLS LIKE PYTHON FOR FREE ARE COMPLAINING BECAUSE THEY WANT CONTRIBUTORS TO SPEND MORE TIME ON THEIR PREFERRED LEGACY VERSION SINCE THEY DON'T WANT TO INVEST RESOURCES IN PORTING CODE I FIND THIS A BIT OUTRAGEOUS TO BE HONEST
THE IDEA THAT PYTHON IS HARDER FOR NEWBIE PROGRAMMERS IS BEYOND BAFFLING TO ME MY JOB GOT NOTICEABLY EASIER WHEN I SWITCHED FROM TEACHING PYTHON 2 TO PYTHON THE STUFF ZED IS TALKING ABOUT AREN'T ISSUES FOR BEGINNERS
WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WRITE A REBUTTAL TO A TROLL THE TROLL DOESN'T CARE OR PAY ATTENTION TO RESPONSES THAT'S THE POINT START A FIRE FOR NO REASON AND LEAVE I THOUGHT IT WAS TRANSPARENT CLICKBAIT
WHAT A LOAD OF HORSE SHIT
IS THERE ANYTHING IN LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY THAT YOU CAN'T DO ON PYTHON WITH ONLY THE MOST MINOR SYNTAX CHANGES
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN BEEN RAILING AGAINST PYTHON FOR A WHILE NOW
I STARTED WITH PYTHON 2 AND MOVED TO ALMOST AS SOON AS IT CAME OUT FROM WHAT I SAW IT ISN'T EVEN THAT DIFFERENT PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHANGES ARE PRINT NEEDS PARENTHESIS AND GRANGE AREN'T A THING STRINGS ARE NOW IN UNICODE AND SOME BACK END CHANGES ALL OF WHICH ARE BETTER THINGS

PERSONALLY I THINK IT IS WAY BETTER AND HAS ADDED SOME COOL NEW LIBRARIES FOR HANDLING IP ADDRESSES NEW GENERATORS AND PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS
SEE I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH WHAT ZED SAYS BUT HE'S NOT STUPID THIS

AND YOU SHOW UP TO PISS ALL OVER IT TO PROPAGATE THIS MYTH THAT PYTHON IS HAMSTRUNG TO THE POINT OF UNUSABILITY BECAUSE IF THE GREAT AND WISE ZED SHAW CAN T FIGURE IT OUT IN TEN SECONDS THEN IT MUST JUST BE IMPOSSIBLE

FUCK YOU

SADLY I DOUBT THIS WILL HAPPEN AND INSTEAD THEY LL JUST RANT ABOUT HOW I DON T KNOW WHAT I M TALKING ABOUT AND I SHOULD SHUT UP

THIS IS BECAUSE YOU DON T KNOW WHAT YOU RE TALKING ABOUT AND YOU SHOULD SHUT UP

IS TOTALLY OUT OF LINE YOU THE AUTHOR SHOULD FEEL ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR WRITING IT

YOU KNOW THAT PYTHON ARROGANCE ZED MENTIONED THIS IS IT I'VE RAISED A FEW ISSUES WITH IN MY TIME AND I'VE MET THE SAME HOSTILITY

WHAT ARE YOU DOING DONT BE A JERK

THERE'S THIS THING PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY SEE AN OPINION THEY DONT LIKE

POINT BY POINT REBUTTAL OF EVERY ITEM IN IT WITHOUT REALLY COVERING THE HIGH LEVEL ISSUES

2 PERSONAL ATTACKS

SO NONE OF THE POINTS HE RAISED ARE EVEN REMOTELY VALID WHY ARE THERE DIFFERENT WAYS OF STRING FORMATTING NOW WHY CANT PYTHON 2 LIBRARIES BE LOADED DIRECTLY AND RUN IN A SLOW ENVIRONMENT SOMETHING LIKE CFF HAVING PIP IN PYTHON WOW DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN USE IT IN PYTHON 2 TOO

I'M NOT AGREEING WITH WHAT ZED WROTE I ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH HIM I THINK PYTHON AND TYPE HINTS IS THE FUTURE FOR PYTHON BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MAGICALLY PRETEND THERE ARE NO ISSUES WITH IT

HERE'S THE REAL QUESTION TO ASK

HOW DO YOU GET MORE PEOPLE ON BOARD HAPPILY USING PYTHON

HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THAT CHOOSING PYTHON OVER PYTHON 2 IS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR THE DEVELOPER NOT JUST FOR THE PYTHON COMMUNITY WHICH I THINK IS THE CORE OF THE ISSUE ZED RAISES

HERE'S A COUPLE OF HINTS

MAKE IT GREAT FOR BEGINNERS

2 DONT TELL PEOPLE TO SHUT-UP AND FUCK OFFICIAL
YOU KNOW IT'S KINDA FUNNY BUT AFTER WORKING ON FORTRAN CODES I ALWAYS BITCHED AND COMPLAINED ABOUT GOING THROUGH LEGACY LIBRARIES WHICH WERE WRITTEN BACK IN THE IN FORTRAN AND HOW THE CODE SYNTAX WAS A PAIN TO DEAL WITH COMPARED TO MODERN FORTRAN SYNTAX

BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE I CAN ALSO SEE FROM PYTHON WHAT KIND OF ISSUES CAN ARISE IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY AND HOW MUCH WORK GOES INTO CONVERTING LIBRARIES

I GUESS BOTH HAVE THEIR UPS AND DOWNS
TALK ABOUT A COMMUNITY THAT CAN'T HANDLE CRITICISM THIS SUBMISSION HAS MORE DOWNVOTES THAN UPVOTES
TURING COMPLETENESS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE TO SHOW THAT A LANGUAGE IS TURING COMPLETE YOU HAVE TO FEED IT THE ENTIRE SET OF ALL POSSIBLE PROGRAMS TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN BE READ BY IT IT'S JUST SO OBVIOUS POINTLESS TO CALL A LANGUAGE TURING COMPLETE WHEN IT CANNOT BE PROVEN
MAYBE TYPE CHECKING WILL FINALLY HELP PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT PYTHON IS NOT JUST GOOD FOR CODING SMALL SCRIPTS
NAIVE ARGUMENT TYPE HINTING IS A VERY LONG TIME AWAY FROM GIVING BENEFITS RIGHT NOW WITNESS HOW LONG PYTHON IS TAKING TO MAKE INROADS AND ADD HOW IS INGRAINED IN THE COMMUNITY I THINK IT'S FAIRLY POSSIBLE THAT IT WILL NEVER BE COMMONPLACE ENOUGH FOR IT TO BE ON PAR WITH SAY PRIMITIVE TYPE SYSTEM

WHILE I AM IN THE STATIC TYPING CAMP BUT I LIKE PYTHON AND CODE IT EVERYDAY I CAN ACCEPT THAT THE QUESTION OF STATIC AND DYNAMIC IS NOT AN OBJECTIVE MATTER THOUGH
NICE WORK THANKS

WAS BROWSING ON MY IPHONE AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IT'S NOT EASY TO READ THE SIDEBAR SCALES PROPORTIONALLY AS I AND THE MAIN BAR NEVER REACHES READABLE SIZE UNLESS I USE READER MODE BEST TO USE A MEDIA QUERY TO HIDE THE SIDEBAR FOR ALL PHONE WIDTH SCREENS
VERY NICE CHANCE OF CODE PLEASE
CAN YOU GIVE A TL R OF THE ALGORITHMS LIBRARIES YOU USED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS
THAT'S PRETTY COOL NOW IF YOU WERE ABLE TO ADD BEAT MATCHING TO MATCH UP SIMILAR TEMPOS HMM
ALSO REMEMBER THAT ALL INPUT ARE STRINGS SO IF YOU WANT TO USE YOU WOULD NEED TO CONVERT IT TO AND INTEGER FIRST
SO THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE BUT FIRST IF YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR MAIN FUNCTION IN A LOOP YOU CAN DO SO JUST AS YOU SAID

RESPONSE TRUE
WHILE RESPONSE
MAIN
IF AGAIN Y
RESPONSE TRUE
ELSE
RESPONSE FALSE

THIS IS A VERY BASIC VERSION OF WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO WITH IT TO ALLOW THE USER TO CHOOSE TO RUN THE PROGRAM AGAIN ALSO NOTICE THAT YOU CAN REORGANIZE YOUR FUNCTIONS SO THAT EVERYTHING IS MORE MODULAR AND EASIER TO READ AND COMPREHEND

AS FAR AS CHECKING TO SEE IF THE USER INPUT IS CORRECT YOU'D NEED TO CONSTRUCT YOUR PROGRAM TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW THE USER INPUTS DATA AND WHAT THE USER MIGHT INPUT

FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ASK THE USER A YES OR NO QUESTION YOU MIGHT WANT THEM TO RESPOND WITH EITHER A Y OR N AND HAVE ANY OTHER INPUT TO BE IGNORED THEN YOU CAN CHECK FOR THIS USING PROPER CONTROLS IN SOMETHING LIKE A WHILE LOOP OR SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE EASIER TO USE LIKE A RECURSIVE FUNCTION

FALSE
WHILE FALSE
RES SOME QUESTION
IF RES Y
DO SOMETHING HERE
TRUE
ALIF RES N
DO ANOTHER THING HERE
TRUE
ELSE
DO SOMETHING ELSE HERE

OBVIOUSLY THE MORE POSSIBLE RESPONSES THE TRICKER THIS CAN GET BUT THERE A LOT OF METHODS AND STRATEGIES YOU CAN USE FOR PLANNING AND BUILDING A USER INTERFACE THAT YOU CAN LOOK INTO IT YOU WANTED BUT WOULD BE OVER KILL FOR A PROJECT LIKE THIS
DEF MAIN
OF ALL YOU SHOULD CHANGE TYPE FOR TEMP VARIABLE
STRING TO INTEGER
TEMP INT INPUT WHAT IS THE TEMPERATURE ENTER
WEATHER INPUT WHAT IS THE WEATHER SUNNY CLOUDY
WATER INPUT WHAT IS THE WATER CLARITY CLEAR MURKY

I CHECK VALUE OF TEMP VARIABLE
CASE OF TEMP A KEY WILL BE
OTHER CASE IT WILL BE
KEY INT TEMP

I USE DICTIONARY FOR AVOID OF MANY IF STATEMENTS
RESULT

SUNNY
CLEAR USE A DARK ROOTWORM DROPSHOT
MURKY USE A BRIGHT SLOW MOVING CRANKBAIT

CLOUDY
CLEAR USE A BLACK AND BLUE JIG
MURKY USE A LIGHT COLOR JIG



SUNNY
CLEAR USE A YAMAMOTO SENKO
MURKY USE BRIGHT SPINNERBAIT

CLOUDY
CLEAR USE A STOPWATER FROG
MURKY USE A CHARTREUSE CHATTER BAIT




AND I JUST RETURN RESULT FROM DICTIONARY STRUCTURE
RETURN RESULT KEY

CAN USE MAIN FUNCTION IN LOOP OR AS HOW AS YOU WANT
EXAMPLE
WHILE TRUE
PRINT MAIN
TMP INPUT ONCE AGAIN Y N
IF Y
INPUT PRESS ENTER TO EXIT
BREAK
SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH
PAYT IS MY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WRITE THE GUI CODE BY HAND YOU CAN USE THEIR DESIGNER TOOL TO DRAW IT INSTEAD IT HELPS GET THE GUI STUFF OUT OF THE WAY SO YOU CAN FOCUS ON THE REST OF THE APPLICATION
I JUST FINISHED MINE WITH PAYT I USED ALC TO DO THE AUDIO BUT I KNOW THERE IS A PHOTON EXTENSION TO PLAY MEDIA IN PAYT I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ABOUT PEGLET BUT PAYT IS A GOOD GUI AND HAS QTCREATOR WHICH MAKES THE BEGINNING DESIGN VERY QUICK
PEGLET ISN'T REALLY A GUI LIBRARY BUT IF YOU ARE KEEPING THE GUI VERY MINIMAL MIGHT BE OK

AS WELL AS PAYT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER CIVY IT ALSO SUPPORTS ANDROID GIVING YOU A ROUTE TO MOBILE
THANKS GUYS I WILL TRY PAYT
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT JUPYTERHUB YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SECURITY WHEN IMPLEMENTING THIS SINCE NOTEBOOKS GIVE PEOPLE ABILITY TO RUN ARBITRARY CODE AND EVEN SHELL COMMANDS

EDIT TAKE A LOOK AT THIS REPO THE READE LINKS TO THE REPOS WITH THE CODE FOR HTTPS
JINJA 2 IT MIGHT NOT BE THE LIGHTEST BUT IT WILL FIT THE BILL DO A LOOP OVER FILES IN THE DIRECTORY FILTER FOR IMAGES CONCATENATE RENDERED RESULTS FROM JINJA 2 AND WRITE TO A SINGLE HEML FILE
SINCE YOU WON'T NEED ADVANCED FEATURES LIKE INHERITANCE THIS COULD BE DONE IN PURE PYTHON WITHOUT MUCH HASSLE NO NEED FOR ADDING ANOTHER DEP TO THE PROJECT
YOU CAN TRY BOTTLE IT'S NOT JUST A HEML TEMPLATE BUT IT'S A SINGLE FILE PACKAGE
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MISCODE OR SUBLIME BUT IF YOUR USED TO USING INTELLIJ WHY WOULDN'T YOU USE PYCHARM ASSUMING YOUR ASKING ABOUT THIS FOR PYTHON DEVELOPMENT SINCE THIS IS R PYTHON THEY ARE BOTH BY JETBRAINS SO THERE ARE LIKELY FEATURES IN INTELLIJ THAT SIMILAR IN PYCHARM I'M CERTAIN THAT PYCHARM HAS THE FEATURE YOU ASKED ABOUT
YOU COULD INSTALL THE FOLLOWING PYTHON PUGIN FOR MISCODE
ITEMS ITEMNAME

THIS SUPPORTS SEARCHING THROUGH SYMBOLS IN YOUR PROJECT
I FIRST DISCOVERED WORDIEST WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ENGLISH DICTIONARY THAT I COULD ACCESS FROM A SCRIPTURE AFTER USING IT FOR A WHILE I REALIZED THAT WORDIEST MIGHT BE THE MOST POWERFUL DICTIONARY THESAURUS IN THE WORLD IN THIS POST I SHARE SOME THE AMAZING CAPABILITIES OF THIS DATABASE THE EXAMPLES ARE IN PYTHON NOLT
WORDIEST WAS LAST UPDATED IN I WONDER HOW MANY WORDS HAVE BEEN ADDED OR CHANGED SINCE
THIS DOES LOOK VERY INTERESTING TO ME HAS ANYONE PLAYED WITH IT ALREADY FIRST IMPRESSIONS
STILL NO TSH IMPROVEMENTS OPTION TO USE A KEY AGENT MULTI FACTOR AUTH SUPPORT PROPER PROXY TUNNEL SUPPORT

COME ON JETBRAINS
WHAT'S NEW IN PYCHARM
PRO IS FREE FOR STUDENTS JUST A REMINDER
I WON'T LINK TO IT TO NOT BUT I'M DOING A WEBINAR ON WEDNESDAY SHOWING THE NEW FEATURES IN
IS BUYING THE OTHER VERSION OF PYCHARM WORTH IT
TERMINAL WITH VIRTUALENV

YES THIS IS AWESOME THANKS
NUMBER
I COULDN'T SEEM TO GET THE BUILT IN TERMINAL TO WORK WITH CONDA ENVIRONMENTS BUT MAY NEED TO WORK WITH IT MORE PREVIOUSLY I COULD ACTIVATE A CONDA ENVIRONMENT BUT NOW NOT ONLY DOES IT NOT AUTOMATICALLY ACTIVATE IT IT SEEMS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO MANUALLY DO SO
FOR ME IT IS FASTER THAN BUT IT'S CONSUMING MORE RAM

GREAT UPDATE
GREAT IMPROVEMENTS KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK PYCHARM
YOU CAN GET THIS FOR FREE WITH A EDU ADDRESS NO
GLAD TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS TO GIT U PAULEVERITT IS SUPPORT FOR GIT ADD P PARTIAL ADDITION IN THE PIPELINE
I JUST DOWNLOADED COMMUNITY EDITION AND FIGURED ITS A GREAT TOOL BUT WITH SOME SHORT COMING

DOES NOT RESPECT SHEBANG MY SCRIPT IS POINTING TO PYTHON WHICH IS NOT DEFAULT BUT IT SHOWS EXTERNAL LIBRARIES FROM DEFAULT VERSION

2 JUST LIKE VISUAL STUDIO CODE IT SHOWS ERROR IN PRINT METHOD WHEN USED WITH END PARAMETER EAST G PRINT C END

BUT OVERALL A BLISS FOR LINUX USERS
SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ITS FAIRLY SIMPLE TO GET THE HANG OF
YOU COULD MAKE A BUMPY ARRAY THAT USES THAT AREA OF MEMORY AS ITS BUFFER

IN LINUX YOUR TARGET PROCESS WOULD HAVE TO BE A FORK OF YOUR PYTHON PROCESS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT MEMORY I BELIEVE NOT SURE ABOUT WINDOWS
THERE'S DEV MEM


SO I ONLY KNOW LINUX SO THIS MIGHT NOT BE USEFUL LINUX HAS THIS INTERFACE KNOWN AS TRACE IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT I KNOW OF TO MANIPULATE ANOTHER PROCESS IF YOU HAVE EVER USED GDB THEN YOU HAVE USED TRACE AS ITS A SMALL WRAPPER
THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING THE DOCUMENTATION IS GREAT BUT HOW ARE TEMPLATES DEFINED I MEAN I SEE THERE SOMETHING ABOUT INVOICE REPORTS BUT HOW CAN THESE BE DEFINED
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO IMPORT

WATCH V
JUST LIKE LAST TIME SOMEONE POSTED ABOUT SCRAPY I AM AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT IT CAN DO THAT THE STANDARD LIBRARY REQUESTS CAN'T DO IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF CODE

THIS IS AN HONEST QUESTION I HAVE NOT USED SCRAPY MYSELF BUT I HAVE WRITTEN SCRAPERS AND NOT FOUND ANY PART OF MY CODE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ABSTRACTED WITHOUT LOSING FUNCTIONALITY EVERY WEBSITE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND YOU STILL NEED ALL THE CUSTOM LOGIC TO REFLECT THAT FOR A SIMPLE CRAWL MIRROR YOU CAN JUST USE AGET

THE ONLY THING I FOUND IN THE LINKED ARTICLE IS THAT SCRAPY SIMPLIFIES PARALLELISM IN MY OPINION IT IS DEBATABLE WHETHER PARALLELISM SHOULD EVEN BE INCLUDED IN AN ALL-PURPOSE SCRAPING LIBRARY AFTER ALL THE PRIMARY USE CASE IS SCRAPING ARBITRARY WEBSITES WHERE GOOD TONE DICTATES THAT YOU SHOULD RATHER THROTTLE THAN PARALLELIZE SO AS NOT TO IMPACT THE PERFORMANCE

MOSTLY
CAN SCRAPY TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT COMMANDS I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I KEEP READING THESE REVIEWS AND STUFF AND CAN'T FIND ANY MORE ABOUT IT

I HAVE A WORKING SOLUTION WITH SELENIUM BUT IF I COULD REPLACE THAT WITH SOMETHING THAT'S SLIGHTLY LESS RELIANT ON ACTING LIKE A PERSON I'D BE A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH IT

I KNOW I SHOULD JUST DO IT WITH SCRAPY AND SEE WHAT COMES UP BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE NOW WORKS
DELETED
VERY NICE I'LL KEEP THIS IN MIND IF DOESN'T WORK OUT FOR MY CURRENT PROJECT NICE TO KNOW THERE ARE MORE OPTIONS OUT THERE
I THINK YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LIKE PYINSTALLER
ALSO A SEARCH GAVE ME THIS
CHECK OUT PYNSIST

FROM THE DOCS PYNSIST IS A TOOL TO BUILD WINDOWS INSTALLERS FOR YOUR PYTHON APPLICATIONS THE INSTALLERS BUNDLE PYTHON ITSELF SO YOU CAN DISTRIBUTE YOUR APPLICATION TO PEOPLE WHO DON T HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED

LINK
REDDIN USES PYLONS PYRAMID WAS JUST OFFICIALLY ADOPTED BY THE PYLONS PROJECT AS IT'S REPLACEMENT WEB FRAMEWORK

YOU CAN SEE A LIST OF PROJECT THAT USE PYRAMID ON THE POWERED BY PYRAMID SITE HTTPS LOOK AT THE SHOOTOUT PROJECT SOURCE CODE FOR AN EXAMPLE OF A SIMPLE PYRAMID APP AND WAREHOUSE THE PEPI REPLACEMENT FOR AN AMBITIOUS AND COMPLEX APP EXAMPLE

BOTTI IS A NICE CMS WRITTEN WITH PYRAMID THAT USES SQLALCHEMY AND TRAVERSAL SEE AND BOTTI BOTTI
APPENLIGHT SEE THE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN


IF THIS IS A LEGIT COMPLAINT YOU'LL HATE ALMOST ANY LANGUAGE PARENS ARE PRETTY COMMON IN THE MAJORITY

THAT SAID DEPENDING ON YOUR EDITOR LOOK INTO SNIPPETS LIVE TEMPLATES OR SIMILAR NAMES YOU COULD TYPE P AND IT EXPAND TO PRINT WHERE IS YOUR CURSOR LOCATION SNIPPETS ARE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN THIS EVEN SHOWS
LIKE ANY OTHER FUNCTION CALL IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL

IF THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL TO YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET A JOB AND NEED TO WRITE SOME JAVASCRIPT OR SOMETHING
IS IT REALLY SUCH A BIG DEAL FOR YOU IT MAKES THINGS MORE CONSISTENT TOO
GET OVER IT
RELATIVE PATHS ARE RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY NOT THE FILE THAT IS CURRENTLY EXECUTING IF IS SOMEHOW CALLING SCRIPTS THEN YOUR CURRENT DIRECTORY IS PROBABLY NOT SCRIPTS IN THAT CASE THE CORRECT RELATIVE PATH TO YOUR TEXT FILE IS DATA YOU SHOULD OUTPUT YOUR CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY FROM PYTHON TO BE SURE

IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE CORRECT SUBREDDIT FOR ASKING PYTHON QUESTIONS YOU COULD TRY READING THE SIDEBAR

GETTING LOST IS FUN
PYTHON

I'M EXACTLY STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME PROBLEM RIGHT NOW
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN YOUR PAGE SOUTH THE BEST PLACE TO POST PYTHON PROGRAMMING QUESTIONS IS UNDER R LEARNPYTHON IT'S WRITTEN IN THE SIDEBAR
YOU CAN USE



TO GET THE ABSPATH FROM A RELATIVE PATH OF YOUR DATA OR SCRIPTS FOLDERS BY NAVIGATING RELATIVE TO THE LOCATION OF THE FILE YOU'RE IN
I BELIEVE YOU CAN USE THIS UNLESS I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION CORRECTLY

IMPORT OS

PRINT PATH TO FOLDER

YOU CAN ALSO DO THIS

ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU WANT YOUR CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY YOU CAN DO THE FOLLOWING

IMPORT OS

FIRST I WOULD SAY TO LEARN PANDAS BUMPY SNIPY ETC THAT BEING SAID THERE IS A GOOD COURSE ON COURSER ABOUT THIS

LEARN

IT DEPENDS A LOT ON WHAT AREA YOU ARE WORKING IN ANY COMPANY THAT REQUIRES REAL QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WILL HAVE THEIR OWN HISTORICAL DATABASE BACKREST TRADING SYSTEMS THEY AREN'T USING OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS THAT POPPED UP TWO YEARS AGO

EXCEL IS PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY CONSTANT IN PRACTICE I'VE FOUND THAT INTERFACING BETWEEN EXCEL AND PYTHON IS RARELY OPTIMAL BECAUSE IT MAKES YOUR WORK CHALLENGING TO SHARE EXCEL AND PYTHON ALSO HAVE HUGE FEATURE OVERLAP SO IF YOU START IN ONE SYSTEM THERE ISN'T REALLY A POINT IN ADDING ANOTHER

WHEN DATA NEEDS TO CROSS BETWEEN SYSTEMS I'LL DUMP TO CSF OR INTERFACE WITH A DATABASE INSTEAD OF TYING TOGETHER A MESS OF PYTHON EXCEL SBA
FIRST LEARN PYTHON SECOND LEARN SOME PACKAGES LIKE PANDAS LEARN HOW TO USE QUANTOPIAN WHICH IS WHAT QUANTS IN HEDGE FUNDS USE
YOU COULD TRY IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN TRADING ALGORITHMS

BUT HONESTLY MOST WORK IN FINANCE IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER FIELD CUSTOM BUSINESS RULES AROUND CUSTOM DATA MODELS IN A REGULAR RELATIONAL DATABASE THE ONLY CRUX IS THAT FINANCE REGULATIONS ARE A VAST MINEFIELD OF EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULES SO IT CAN TAKE MORE TIME TO GRASP THAN OTHER FIELDS FOR A GENERAL DEVELOPER
THERE IS AN O'REILLY BOOK ON THE MATTER AND A VERY GOOD ONE AT THAT HAVEN'T FINISHED IT YET CALLED PYTHON FOR FINANCE IT ALSO HAS AN ACCOMPANYING WEBSITE THAT HAS ALL THE CODE AND THE PYTHON NOTEBOOKS AVAILABLE FOR FREE HERE
I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF SCI KIT LEARN USED IN THE FINANCE FIELD
COUPON SAVE YOU WILL LEARN MANUAL TESTING PYTHON AND SELENIUM ALL YOU NEED TO SECURE YOUR DREAM JOB IN AUTOMATION TESTING OR IMPROVE YOUR SKILLS IN AUTOMATION TESTING
PYTHON IS BROKEN
I GUESS THE LESSON IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO MIX THE TYPES YOU USE AS KEYS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE TYPE HIERARCHY
TRUE

THIS HAS NOTHING DO WITH IT

CLASS KYTHING OBJECT

TRUE MAYBE KYTHING NOPE RETURNS AS WRITTEN

HOWEVER WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IS THAT TRUE AND ALL HASH TO THE SAME VALUE THAT IS BECAUSE ANTS HASH TO THEMSELVES

TRUE MAYBE KYTHING NOPE I GOT TRUE NOPE
IT MIGHT BE WORTH TO PREFER ASYNC AWAIT AND TARGET AT LEAST PHYTON RATHER THAN YIELD FROM I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF TRYING SUPPORT PYTHON
THIS SHOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR PEOPLE LOOKING TO GET THEIR FEET WET THE MODULE DOCS FOR ASYNCIO ARE INTIMIDATINGLY LARGE I DEFINITELY FELT LIKE I WAS STUMBLING THROUGH MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT USING IT WHEN IT SHOWED UP WITH PYTHON
I STARTED DIVING INTO ASYNCIO AND ENDED UP USING EVENT

I WISH EVENT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR WERE ADDED TO THE STANDARD LIBRARY THE WHOLE MONKEY PATCHING PART FEELS WELL LIKE A HACK NO SURPRISES THERE
ALL ASYNCIO TUTORIALS SEEM TO BECOME IRRELEVANT TO ME SINCE THEY MOSTLY TRY TO SHOW EXAMPLES USING IT REALLY IS THE WORST WAY TO DEMONSTRATE ASYNCIO

SLEEP ISN'T IO THE ONLY REASON YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT IS BECAUSE IT IS LITERALLY A SLEEP FUNCTION

IF YOU DEMONSTRATE ON SOMETHING LIKE READING AND WRITING FROM DISK OR SOCKET THEN PEOPLE START TO SEE WHY THEY WOULD EVEN BOTHER WITH ASYNCIO IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THE BENEFITS ARE SO EVIDENT IN CASES WHERE YOUR APP HAS TO WAIT FOR REAL IO

I HAVE SOME EXAMPLE CODE THAT YOU CAN RUN AND OBSERVE TO SEE THE BENEFIT OF ASYNCIO FOR YOURSELF I'LL POST IT HERE LATER IT'S ON MY WORK PC
SKIMMED THE ARTICLE COULD ANYONE GIVE A NEW DEVELOPER AN ELI I BELIEVE I KNOW WHAT THREADING IS GIVING DIFFERENT THREADS ON PROCESSORS DIFFERENT TASKS TO RUN AT THE SAME TIME HOW IS ASYNCHIO DIFFERENT AND OR THE SAME

AS SOMEONE GETTING INTO DURANGO IS IT WORTH IT TO USE THIS ON SOMETHING LIKE A REALLY BASIC PYTHONANYWHERE OR BACKSPACE SERVER OR ARE THEY NOT REALLY POWERFUL ENOUGH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS
THIS ARTICLE HAS ONE OF THE BEST EXPLANATIONS OF EVENT LOOP COROUTINES AND FUTURES THAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR
FIRST OF ALL EXCELLENT TUTORIAL DEFINITELY THE BEST ON THE SUBJECT AND THE ONLY ONE THAT GAVE ME A PROPER INSIGHT OF ASYNCIO FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE A BIT CONFUSED I'M THINKING OF THE FOLLOWING ANALOGY WHEN CONSIDERING SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION CONCURRENCY AND PARALLELISM

IMAGINE YOU HAVE GLASSES AND WANT TO FILL THEM WITH COKE

SEQUENTIAL YOU HAVE TO FILL ONE GLASS COMPLETELY BEFORE YOU MOVE ON TO THE SECOND GLASS WHEN YOU POUR COKE YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE FOAM TO SETTLE DOWN I EAST THE TASK OF POURING IS BLOCKED TO CONTINUE POURING COKE TO THE GLASS

2 CONCURRENT YOU FILL ONE GLASS BUT WHEN FOAM STARTS TO FORM YOU START POURING ON THE OTHER GLASS THIS WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A CERTAIN TASK TO FINISH BUT INSTEAD OF WAITING YOU CONTINUE WITH ANOTHER TASK HOWEVER NOTE THAT YOU ALWAYS ARE POURING COKE TO ONE GLASS AT A TIME

PARALLEL YOU CALL SOME FRIENDS AND HAND THEM A BOTTLE ALL THREE OF YOU ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY POURING COKE EACH ONE IN HIS OWN GLASS AT THE SAME TIME

GREAT THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING SIMILIAR FOR TWISTED
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PISTON AND PIPY ONLY SPEED PIPY SEEMS HAVE THE BETTER PERFORMANCE NOW
IF SPEED IS NOT THE ONLY THING WHAT IS THE MOST NOTICEABLE DOWNSIDE OF PIPY COMPARING TO PISTON
MPH A NEW INTERPRETER WITH NO PYTHON SUPPORT I HOPE ITS IN THEIR PLANS AT LEAST I REALLY WANT A JIT WITH ASYNCIO SUPPORT
THE EXCITING THING ABOUT PISTON IS THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGH COMPATIBILITY HAVING SAID THAT THE PERFORMANCE NUMBERS ARE IMPRESSIVE HETP

I LOOK FORWARD TO GIVING THIS A TRY WITH SOME OF MY OLDER PROJECTS
ANCESTOR PSYCH WAS WRITTEN IN C LIKE PISTON AND PYJION NOT SURE WHY THEY MOVED AWAY TO PYTHON

ALSO PIPY MENTIONED THAT LLM FAILED FOR THEM WITH MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS NOT TO MENTION UNLADEN SWALLOW WE SEE THAT PISTON HAD TO INTRODUCE TWO-LEVEL OPTIMIZATION WITH LIGHTER JIT THAN LLM SO IS LLM IR EVEN A RIGHT CHOICE FOR JIT OF HIGHLY DYNAMIC LANGUAGE IT SEEMS THAT LLM IS ONLY WELL-SUITED FOR STATIC LANGUAGES NOTE THAT THE WAY DUMBA SUCCESSFULLY USES LLM FOR COMPILING NUMERICAL CODE IS QUITE DIFFERENT
PAYT BAYSIDE ARE QT BINDINGS FOR PYTHON YOU CAN USE THOSE WITH UIS CREATED BY DESIGNER
THIS IS ALSO MY FAVOURITE GUI LIBRARY FOR PYTHON BECAUSE OF THE POWERFUL FEATURES AND GOOD LOOKS AND THE MENTIONED DESIGNER PROGRAM

I HAVE ALSO WORKED A LITTLE BIT WITH GUI DESIGNER ONE FEATURE YOU PROBABLY WON'T FIND IN QT DESIGNER OR OTHER GRAPHICAL UI DESIGNERS IS THE JUMP TO SOURCE CODE FEATURE FROM MATALAN
HELLO

I'M WORKING ON THE REMI GUI LIBRARY

LOOK AT THIS LIBRARY THIS IS THE LINK OF THE ENTIRE GUI LIBRARY

HERE IS THE LINK TO THE EDITOR


ATK APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT IS PRETTY EASY IN PYTHON AND WINDOW LAYOUT CAN BE DONE USING THE GLADE DESIGN TOOL THE APPLICATIONS ARE CROSS PLATFORM BUT WINDOWS AND MAC AESTHETICS ARE LESS OF A PRIORITY FOR ATK THAN LINUX QT MAY GIVE BETTER RESULTS ACROSS PLATFORMS BUT FOR LINUX NOTHING LOOKS BETTER IMO
I JUST DID IT YESTERDAY ON MY MATCHBOOK AIR I'M A BEGINNER PROGRAMMER AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT MINUTES NO PROBLEMS AT ALL WITH THE GUI BASED INSTALLER
OK THAT'S A RELIEF TO HEAR THANK YOU
AGET
SH ANACONDA SH

AND FOLLOW THE PROMPTS
ANY SCRIPTS YOUR OS HAS THAT DEPENDS ON PYTHON IS PROBABLY NOT RUN BY YOUR USER OR ANY USER ROOT DAEMON ETC WHOSE ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY ANACONDA BEING INSTALLED SOME LIKELY CALL THE SYSTEM PYTHON DIRECTLY

WHEN YOU INSTALL ANACONDA YOU CAN OPTIONALLY ASK IT TO ADD IT TO YOUR PATH VIA YOUR BASHARA OR SIMILAR THIS MAKES IT SIMPLE TO CALL EXECUTABLE WITH JUST THE FILENAME LIKE PYTHON OR CONDA IF YOU DIDN'T MODIFY YOUR BASHARA THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPECIFY THE FULL PATH TO RUN THOSE COMMANDS PATH TO ANACONDA BIN PYTHON

SO LONG STORY SHORT IT DOESN'T BREAK YOUR SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU AREN'T INSTALLING IT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR YOUR SYSTEM PYTHON THE EXECUTABLE ARE JUST SITTING ON THE FILE SYSTEM AND AREN'T USUALLY INSTALLED IN A DEFAULT SYSTEM LOCATION LIKE USR BIN AS MENTIONED BEFORE YOU DON'T USUALLY MODIFY THE ENVIRONMENT OF ROOT OR DAEMON OR OTHER SYSTEM USER SO THEY DON'T SEARCH PATH TO ANACONDA BIN FOR THE COMMANDS THEY RUN
COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY EXACTLY YOU THINK THIS SHOULD BREAK YOUR SYSTEM THE PYTHON ON MINT UBUNTU IS JUST PRE INSTALLED IT IS NOT BAKED IN DID I MISS SOMETHING HERE TO BE HONEST I NEVER HEARD ABOUT ANACONDA BEFORE
ANACONDA BY DEFAULT INSTALLS AS YOUR DEFAULT SYSTEM PYTHON THAT ALSO ROUTES STUFF LIKE PIP WHICH IS A PART OF YOUR PYTHON INSTALLATION AND MAKES SURE EVERY PACKAGE GETS INSTALLED TO THE RIGHT PLACE
I SUGGEST THAT YOU DON'T CROSS POST

BEYOND THAT IT'S VERY NICE THAT YOU'RE BLOGGING ABOUT WHAT YOU LEARN KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK
NOTEWORTHY UPDATES INCLUDE

ARGON 2 CRYPT HASH SUPPORT
TFTP SUPPORT
PBKDF 2 NOW HAS FASTER BUILTIN BACKEND AND UTILIZES OTHER BACKENDS WHERE AVAILABLE
LOTS OF API CLEANUPS AND INTERNAL REFRACTURING
HTPASSWDFILE READER IS NOW MORE FLEXIBLE AND WITH IMPROVED SECURITY OPTIONS
REFRESHED DOCUMENTATION

RELEASE NOTES
IT JUST WRAPS AROUND THE COINFER WEB SERVICE THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY PYTHON HERE AT ALL

I MEAN YES THE TITLE IS TECHNICALLY TRUE BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE WROTE COINFER PYTHON WRAPPER FOR ACCEPTING BITCOINS INSTEAD I WAS HOPING TO SEE SOME PYTHON BLOCK CHAIN HANDLING INTERACTION
RELEASE CHANGELING HERE
I ALREADY DOWNLOADED IT AND NOW I JUST CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT FORMAT STRINGS
PEP SIMPLER CUSTOMIZATION OF CLASS CREATION

I REALLY DISLIKE HOW THIS ENDED UP YOU NOW HAVE METACLASE DEFINITION BASECLASSES AND ALL OF THE CUSTOM CLASS CREATION KEYWORD ARGUMENTS INSIDE OF THE SAME PARENTHESIS

CLASS PLAYER BASEENTITY INVENTORY PROTOTYPE 2 METACLASE

ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE THAT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO NEED TO USE THIS NEW METHOD IF A METACLASE IS BEING USED REGARDLESS I FIND IT AWFUL THAT THEY CAN'T COME UP WITH A NEW SYNTAX
RELEASE DL LINK
DOWNLOADS RELEASE PYTHON

I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW FILE SYSTEM PATH OBJECTS GOING TO BE SO USEFUL
I KNOW THIS WILL SOUND LIKE HERESY BUT THEY'VE BEEN DEVELOPING PYTHON FOR YEARS NOW IT'S REALLY GREAT IT'S SO GREAT THAT I WONDER IF THEY REALLY NEED TO KEEP ADDING NEW FEATURES I MEAN CAN THEY EVER JUST BE FINISHED WITH DEVELOPING IT MAYBE JUST PUSHING OUT SECURITY UPDATES SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF OPEN SOURCE MINDSHARE GOING TO A PRODUCT THAT'S ALREADY FINE
BROKEN LINK
THAT'S A NICE HACK BUT THERE ARE FANTASTIC LIBRARIES FOR THIS SORT OF THING MY ARE ASK AND JOBLIB
THE LAST TIME I LOOKED MORE THAN A YEAR AGO I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING AND I WAS AM STILL RELATIVELY NEW TO TESTING BUT WHAT I ENDED UP DOING WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS EXAMPLE USES NITTIEST BUT PERTEST WORKED AND NOSE WOULD TOO

THE REST OF THE TESTING COULD NOW BE DONE NORMALLY WITH A CAVEAT THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY TEST INTERACTIONS OR REACTIONS ETC YOU COULD THOUGH CHECK MANY OTHER THINGS FOR INSTANCE THAT IT WAS

SET UP CORRECTLY
CALLED WITH THE PROPER VALUES OR
CLEANED UP

I HOPE THIS HELPS IF YOU LEARN ANYTHING NEW PLEASE LET ME KNOW
WITHOUT MENTIONING WHAT YOU THINK IT'S DIFFICULT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT YOU CAN DO

BUT ONE QUESTION YOU KNOW ALL THE PIECES IS ISOLATION BUT YOU KNOW HOW THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER EAST G A REQUEST COMES THROUGH THE SGI RESPONDER WHICH DURANGO ROUTES THROUGH THE MAIN TO FIND THE APP RESPONSIBLE FOR IT THEN IT CHANGES THE APP TO FIND WHICH VIEW WILL ANSWER FOR IT THEN IT CALLS THE VIEW WHICH COULD IN TURN CALL THE FORM WHICH WOULD CALL THE MODEL WITH THE RESULTS FROM THE FORM IT WILL CALL THE TEMPLATE RETURN IT TO THE SGI AS A RESPONSE AND THEN THE BROWSER WILL SEE THE RESULTS
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR HAVING TROUBLE GRASPING THE MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER AVC CONCEPT AND ALSO HOW SGI WORKS

I'VE FOUND THE DURANGO POLL APP TUTORIAL GIVES YOU SOME CONFIDENCE TO PLAY AROUND WITH DURANGO BUT STILL LEAVES YOU FEELING LOST WHEN YOU VENTURE INTO MAKING YOUR FIRST APPARENTLY DON'T GIVE UP I USED THIS YOUTUBE TUTORIAL ON DURANGO AND IT REALLY HELPED ME GRASP THE MVP CONCEPT SGI IS STILL A LITTLE FUZZY TO ME BUT I UNDERSTAND ENOUGH TO SETUP MY BURLS IN DURANGO AND GET THE SITE RUNNING ON A SERVER
JUST USE PAYEN TO INSTALL IT

WORKING WITH RASPBERRY PIS AND PYTHON PROCESSING MAINLY YESTERDAY THE IMAGE I WAS WORKING ON CORRUPTED JUST FOR BOFFS LUCKILY I'D THE BULK OF THE CODE ONLY ABOUT EARLIER

TODAY HAD MY BOSS GET UNDERSTANDABLY SHORTY ABOUT THE SITUATION AS IT TURNED OUT SOME PREVIOUSLY WORKING CODE NOW WASN'T FID READER BINARY RUN AS A SUBPROCESS OF A PYTHON SCRIPT WHICH PARSED STOUT THEN TOGGLED A PIN HAD TO ABANDON THAT CODE TAKE ANOTHER APPROACH WHICH MERCIFULLY WORKED

DO YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU INSTALL ALDUINO ON RASPBIAN YOU GET SOME OLD VERSION THAT'S TOTALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH CURRENT SPI EEPROM LIBRARIES IT'S NOT OBVIOUS IF YOU USUALLY RUN SIMPLE SKETCHES SO CAN BE CONFUSING WHEN YOU START TO GET WEIRD ERRORS THE CURRENT VERSION REQUIRES A MANUAL INSTALL

ALSO PYTHON REALLY WOULDN'T BE MY FIRST LANGUAGE ALTHOUGH I THINK I'M KIND OF STARTING TO GET THE HANG OF IT
I'M WORKING ON A PUGIN FOR SUNFLOWER I HAVEN'T CODED IN PYTHON IN AGES SO THIS WILL BE A GOOD REFRESHER

NOT SURE IF ANYONE CARES BUT I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO DO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WITHOUT USING THE METHOD

BASICALLY I MANUALLY CALCULATE THE MOUSE MOVEMENT EVERY ITERATION OF LOOP BY COMPARING THE RESULT OF THE METHOD AGAINST WHAT THE MOUSE POSITION WAS LAST ITERATION I THEN FEED THIS TO THE MY UPDATE METHOD

NOT SURE IF I WAS JUST USING THE BUILT-IN METHOD INCORRECTLY OR WHAT BUT I GUESS I'LL RUN IT LIKE THIS

HELLO WORLD

PRINT HELLO WORLD

PYTHON IS SCRIPTED WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS INTERPRETED AT IF YOU HAVE AN ERROR THE PROGRAM WILL EXECUTE UNTIL IT GETS TO THAT ERROR JAVA IS COMPILED WHICH MEANS THAT IF THERE IS A SYNTAX ERROR THE PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN THIS MAKES JAVA FASTER THAN PYTHON

PYTHON SUPPORTS PROGRAMMING BUT JAVA CAN ONLY BE PROGRAMMED IN AN MANNER THIS MAKES JAVA BETTER FOR LARGER APPLICATIONS AND PYTHON BETTER FOR SMALLER APPLICATIONS AND SCRIPTING THOUGH THERE ARE CERTAINLY LARGE PROGRAMS DONE IN PYTHON AND SMALL PROGRAMS DONE IN JAVA

PYTHON USES INDENTATION INSTEAD OF BRACES WHICH MAKES GOOD PROGRAMMING STYLE MANDATORY JAVA DOES NOT SO YOU HAVE TO CONSCIOUSLY USE GOOD STYLE IN JAVA TO KEEP IT READABLE

FINALLY JAVA IS NAMED AFTER COFFEE AND PYTHON IS NAMED AFTER A BRITISH COMEDY TROUPE

THOSE ARE THE HIGH-LEVEL DIFFERENCES
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SO THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENCES BUT I'D SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS DYNAMIC TYPING HOW THIS AFFECTS YOU DEPENDS ON WHICH LANGUAGE YOU'RE GOING FROM AND TO BUT ASSUMING YOU KNOW SOMETHING OF JAVA AND ARE LOOKING TOWARDS PYTHON

IN JAVA A VARIABLE IS AN INT OR A FLOAT OR A FILEREADER OR WHATEVER BUT IN PYTHON THERE'S USUALLY NOTHING IN THE WRITTEN CODE TO DECLARE THE VARIABLE TYPE AND NOTHING IN THE RUNNING CODE TO ENFORCE IT

THIS HAS MANY IMPLICATIONS IT OFTEN MAKES DOCUMENTATION LESS CLEAR LACK OF TYPE CHECKING MEANS YOU NEED MORE OF A FOCUS ON PROPER TEST COVERAGE OR AT LEAST COMPREHENSIVE TESTING OF EVERY RELEASE IT MAKES IDES UNHELPFULLY VAGUE AT TIMES

WHAT ABOUT USING HEAP

ULTIMATELY THERE AREN'T MANY GOOD CHOICES A BALANCING TREE BASED ON DES WILL NEED TO BE WRITTEN IN C TO PERFORM ADEQUATELY UNLESS YOU USE A LIST AS YOUR PRIMITIVE STORAGE STRUCTURE LIKE HEAP DOES

ITS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE MORE FRUSTRATING THINGS ABOUT PYTHON THERE AREN'T REALLY ANY DATASTRUCTURES BEYOND LISTS OR DCTS
IT LOOKS LIKE THE ANSWER IS NO THERE ARE LOTS OF LIBRARIES THAT DO IT BUT NO STANDARD LIB STUFF
I'VE USED BISECT WITH TO TRY TO GET CLOSER O FOR APPEND POP FROM EITHER END BUT ROTATING TO GET THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY EFFICIENT AND THE REAL EFFICIENCY FOR THAT DEPENDS ON THE PLATFORM AND MEMCPY IMPLEMENTATION THE UNFORTUNATE ISSUE WITH GOING THIS ROUTE FOR THE SAKE OF EFFICIENCY IS THAT INDEXED ACCESS GETS WORSE AS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE O AT THE ENDS BUT O N IN THE MIDDLE EFFECTIVELY NEGATING THE EFFICIENT INSERTION

AS POINTED OUT ON N THE AUTHOR TRIES TO MAKE THE POINT THAT PYTHON IS NOT TURING COMPLETE WHICH IS SO INSANELY THAT IT BRINGS INTO QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF ANY OF HIS THOUGHTS

CURRENTLY YOU CANNOT RUN PYTHON 2 INSIDE THE PYTHON VIRTUAL MACHINE SINCE I CANNOT THAT MEANS PYTHON IS NOT TURING COMPLETE

THAT IS PRECISELY NOT AT ALL HOW WORKS I THINK WHAT THE AUTHOR IS GETTING CONFUSED ABOUT HERE IS THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN USE A LANGUAGE TO WRITE AN INTERPRETER FOR ANY OTHER LANGUAGE WHICH IS OF COURSE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONCEPT YOU VERY WELL COULD WRITE A PYTHON INTERPRETER IN PYTHON 2 AND VICE VERSA

I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT AS STUPID AS THAT SOUNDS ACTUAL PYTHON PROJECT DEVELOPERS HAVE TOLD ME THIS

I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE A SOURCE FOR THIS
THIS ARTICLE JUST READS AS A RANT AGAINST SOMETHING PYTHON THAT SOMEONE ZED SHAW JUST DOESN'T LIKE AND IS UPSET OTHER PEOPLE DO LIKE IT IT'S NOT WRITTEN TO PERSUADE OR CONVINCE ANYONE BUT TO OPEN THE DOOR TO AN ECHO CHAMBER WHERE PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR VIEWS CAN HOP IN ON A CIRCLE JERK

WHY ADOPTION RATE DOESN'T MATTER

BEFORE GETTING STARTED LETS ADDRESS WHY ADOPTION RATE THE PRIMARY ARGUMENT OF WHY PYTHON IS DYING AND WHY IT'S A BAD LANGUAGE IS A HORRIBLE METRIC AND ISN'T REPRESENTATIVE OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN ADOPTION RATE

PYTHON 2 X IS SUPPORTED UNTIL EXACT DATE HASN'T YET BEEN PROVIDED IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS AND SCIENCES THERE IS A HUGE AVERSION TO CHANGING WHAT WORKS UNTIL IT'S A REQUIREMENT TO DO SO TO MAKE BIG CHANGES TAKES RESOURCES WHICH NO BUSINESS WANTS TO USE TO MAKE THEIR CODE DO THE EXACT SAME THING

WHEN AND IF ADDITIONAL FEATURES OR SUPPORT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED THEN THE CODE WILL BE UPDATED IT'S WHY PYTHON IS STILL BEING USED DESPITE IT'S BEING LATE COBOL WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE REFUSES TO DIE BECAUSE THERE IS STILL A TON OF LEGACY CODE IN THE BIG CORPORATE WORLD THAT WOULD COST MONEY TO PORTUGUESE

UNSUPPORTED ARGUMENTS AND FALSE STATEMENTS GIVEN AS FACT

THIS ENTIRE ARTICLE IS FILLED WITH EXAGGERATIONS SPECULATIONS AND UNJUSTIFIED ABSURD STATEMENTS TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE VERY FIRST UNSUPPORTED CLAIM

THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT PYTHON IS SUCH A FAILURE IT WILL KILL PYTHON

I'M SORRY WHAT PYTHON HAS RECENTLY OVERTAKEN JAVA FOR GROWTH AND POPULARITY ON GITHUB AS I POINTED OUT NO EVIDENCE IS PROVIDED BEYOND A ADOPTION RATE METRIC WHICH I'VE ALREADY POINTED OUT IS A BAD METRIC TO SUPPORT THAT PYTHON IS DYING OR AS HE LATER STATES IS ALREADY DEAD AND WILL NOT ADVANCE

ALSO IT'S BEEN OVER A DECADE MAYBE EVEN MULTIPLE DECADES AND PYTHON STILL ISN'T ABOVE ABOUT IN ADOPTION

PYTHON WAS RELEASED ON DECEMBER THAT MEANS FROM THE TIME THE ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN YEARS MONTHS 2 WEEKS AND DAYS HAD PASSED SO NO IT HASN'T BEEN MULTIPLE DECADES IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN A DECADE

THE PYTHON PROJECT USES PROPAGANDA SOCIAL PRESSURE AND MARKETING TO CONVINCE YOU TO USE IT

THIS IS ANOTHER GRANDIOSE STATEMENT WHICH IS AGAIN UNSUPPORTED THE PYTHON PROJECT IS ACTIVELY CONTINUING TO SUPPORT PYTHON 2 AND RECOMMENDS IT IF IT IS MORE SUITED TO THE PROJECT YOU ARE STARTING OR TO YOUR TARGETED USERS

SOME PEOPLE GO SO FAR AS TO BAN MY BOOK MY BOOK IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR LEARNING TO CODE THE SECOND SOMEONE STARTS BANNING BOOKS YOU KNOW THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THEIR OWN AGENDAS

THIS IS A COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE STATEMENT BEING PASSED OFF AS FACT THE AUTHORS METHODS TEACHING ORDER AND GOALS HAVE WIDELY BEEN CRITICIZED FOR BEING A HORRIBLE FOR BEGINNERS OR ANYONE AND HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM RECOMMENDED LISTS AND DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE OF IT PYTHON THEMSELVES DON'T BAN THE BOOK PEOPLE AND GROUPS BAN THE BOOK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THIS IS BECAUSE MUCH LIKE MY WASTED TIME ARGUING WITH THIS ARTICLE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF EXPLAINING WHY THE BOOK IS SUCH A HORRIBLE INTRODUCTORY RESOURCE THIS SUBREDDIT RECENTLY STARTED A META THREAD TO REMOVE IT AS A RECOMMENDED RESOURCE WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY A NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT

COMPLETE MISUNDERSTANDING OF TRANSLATORS AND TRANSPIRING

THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINDER OF THE ARTICLE ARGUES ABOUT A COMPLETE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TRANSLATING CODE BETWEEN LANGUAGES AND TRANSPIRING CODE WITHOUT SPENDING A TON OF TIME I CAN'T PICK OUT ALL OF THE PROBLEMS FALLACIES OF HIS ARGUMENTS AS IT'S A BIG INTERWOVEN RANTING MESS

ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT MISS THE MARK AND REALLY GOES TO SHOW THAT THE AUTHOR HAS NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A LANGUAGE INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING IT MYSELF SEE U TURBOSACK COMMENT HERE WHO BEAT ME TO IT

FURTHER TO THIS THOUGH ARE THE FOLLOWING NOT EXHAUSTIVE OR ALL INCLUSIVE STATEMENTS

TRANSLATING ONE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE INTO ANOTHER IS A SOLIDLY RESEARCHED TOPIC WITH SOLID MATH BEHIND IT THERE ARE TRANSLATORS THAT CONVERT ANY NUMBER OF LANGUAGES
TRANSLATION IS A FULLY SOLVED PROBLEM
WRITING A TRANSLATOR FROM ONE LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER IS A FULLY PROVEN AND FUNDAMENTAL PIECE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE

WHICH ARE ALL ABSOLUTELY ABSURD TRANSLATION OF ONE LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO DO RIGHT AND IS BY NO MEANS A FULLY SOLVED PROBLEM IN ANY PRACTICAL SENSE THERE'S A VERY VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE AND SUPPORTED THE AUTHOR KNOWS THIS AND IS PURPOSEFULLY MISLEADING YOU WHICH HE SAYS IS A HORRIBLE THING TO DO AS HE LATER WRITES EMPHASIS ADDED

I CAN THEN SIMPLY COMPILE ANY OTHER LANGAUGE INTO THAT VIRTUAL MACHINE AND IT WILL WORK FAIRLY WELL I MAY RUN INTO LITTLE ISSUES WITH COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN LIBRARIES WHEN I AM WORKING WITH WILDLY DIFFERENT LANGAUGE BUT THEY SHOULD WORK FAIRLY WELL TOGETHER

REALLY THE ENTIRE THE AVM AND CLR PROVE IT'S POINTLESS SECTION JUST SHUTS DOWN HIS OWN ARGUMENT OF TRANSPIRING AND TRANSLATING BEING OPTIONS NOT JUST THEORETICALLY POSSIBILITIES

COMPLAINTS ABOUT BYTES VS STRINGS

THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT BYTES VS STRINGS MAY HAVE SOME VALIDITY IN THAT IT CAN BE ANNOYING FOR BEGINNERS TO UNDERSTAND HOWEVER IDENTICAL ARGUMENTS COULD BE SAID ABOUT SETS VS TUPLES OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR AS SOON AS THE AUTHOR STARTS THINKING OF THEM AS DIFFERENT TYPES THAT DON'T HAVE ALL THE SAME

FURTHERMORE THIS WHOLE BYTES VS STRINGS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE OF SEVERE FRUSTRATIONS WITH PYTHON 2 S HANDLING OF UNICODE AND STRING TYPES ESPECIALLY WITH THE IMPLICIT CONVERSIONS THAT THE AUTHOR SO DEARLY WANTS BACK THIS ARTICLE THIS ARTICLE AND THIS HETP ARTICLE ALL APPEARED ON THE FIRST PAGE OF GOOGLE SEARCHES FOR PYTHON 2 UNICODE

TWO COMMON POINTS WERE MADE IN THESE ARTICLES THE STR TYPE ISN'T A STRING IT'S A COLLECTION OF BYTES 2 THE UNICODE TYPE REPRESENTS A STRING

PYTHON ADDRESSES BOTH OF THESE WITH THE BEING THE OLD UNICODE AND BEING THE OLD STRING I THINK CHANGING THE LANGUAGE TO ACTUALLY REPRESENT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER APPROACH AS DID THE PYTHON PROJECT SEEING AS THEY MADE THIS CHANGE

AS SOON AS THE AUTHOR LEARNS THAT BYTES AND STRINGS ARE TWO DIFFERENT OBJECT TYPES AND STOP ASSUMING THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME HE'LL BE BETTER OFFICIAL HIS ARGUMENT THAT THE PROBLEM STEMS FROM THEM BEING STATICALLY TYPED SHOWS HIS IGNORANCE OF THIS THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH STATIC VS DYNAMIC TYPING THIS HAS TO DO WITH OBJECT TYPE INTERACTION THEY CAN'T BE ADDED TOGETHER FOR THE SAME REASON AN AND DEATHTIME OBJECT CAN'T BE ONE OF THE TWO CAN REPRESENT A LARGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VALUES RELATIVE TO THE FIRST AGAIN HISTORY SHOWED THIS WAS JUST A BAD BAD IDEA


TOO MANY FORMATTING OPTIONS

THIS JUST SEEMS LIKE AN ABSURD ATTEMPT AT MORE COMPLAINTS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS THAT THE FORMAT ALLOWED THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE WITH THE OLD STYLE AS IDENTIFIED HERE PEP IS REALLY JUST SYNTACTIC SUGAR FOR THE FORMAT OPTION MAKING IT LESS VERBOSE I'M HOPING I DON'T NEED TO DEFEND WHY HIS ARGUMENT OF WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE IS YET AGAIN ABSOLUTELY ABSURD

CONCLUSIONS

THE ENTIRE ARTICLE IS FILLED WITH STRAW MAN ATTACKS FALSE DILEMMA'S AD HOMINEM ATTACKS BEGGING THE QUESTION CIRCULAR REASONING HASTY GENERALIZATIONS AND A LIST OF OTHER LOGICAL FALLACIES THAT MAKE PICKING OUT RELEVANT COMPLAINTS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE NONE OF HIS ARGUMENTS SUCH AS PYTHON IS DEAD ARE SUPPORTED WITH ANY EVIDENCE AND MOST OF HIS COMPLAINTS ABOUT CHANGES AND DIRECT HAVE LOGICAL REASONS AND A HISTORY BEHIND THEM

PYTHON IS DOING NOTHING BUT GROWING AND THERE'S NOTHING TO INDICATE THIS TREND WILL STOP

EDIT FIXED A FEW TYPOS AND CORRECTED SOME MISSING WORDS IT WAS LATE SORRY
THERE IS MAIN TOPICS IN THAT ARTICLE WHICH GOES OVER AND OVER
AUTHOR CAN'T RUN PYTHON 2 CODE ON PYTHON
DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK
WHEN YOU TRIED TO CONCATENATE BYTES WITH STRING IN YOU GET AN ERROR WITHOUT VARIABLE NAMES
ALSO THERE'S LOT OF ANGRY RANT LOGICAL FALLACY AND PERSONAL OPINION THERE
THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T RUN PYTHON 2 AND PYTHON AT THE SAME TIME IS PURELY A SOCIAL AND TECHNICAL DECISION THAT THE PYTHON PROJECT MADE WITH NO BASIS IN MATHEMATICAL REALITY

HUH SEEMS EASY ENOUGH TO ME
OH MAN YOU JUST MADE MY DAY

I SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE PYTHON TUTOR MAILING LIST AND OTHER FORUMS WHERE WE GET A LOT OF BEGINNERS AND I CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW MANY NEWIES TO PROGRAMMING ARE NEEDLESSLY CONFUSED BY THE BACKWARDS WAY THE HARD WAY BOOK TEACHES THINGS NOW I HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHY HE STARTS BY TEACHING WHILE LOOPS INSTEAD OF FOR LOOPS EVEN THOUGH FOR LOOPS ARE MUCH MORE USEFUL AND EASY TO LEARN

IT'S LIKE YOU WANTED TO TEACH SOMEBODY HOW TO IRON A SHIRT SO YOU START BY TEACHING THEM TO TAKE A HALF BRICK WET IT DOWN STICK IT IN A HOT OVEN UNTIL IT IS HOT THEN POUND THE SHIRT WITH THE BRICK THEN AFTER THEY'VE WASTED WEEKS PERFECTING THEIR SKILLS YOU SAY GUESS WHAT THAT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF YOUR TIME YOU WILL NEVER IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE NEED TO IRON A SHIRT WITH A HOT BRICK BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE THINGS CALLED CLOTHES IRONS
THIS ARTICLE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT BULLSHIT TO ME NEITHER DYNAMIC TYPING OR TURING COMPLETE MEAN WHAT THIS GUY THINKS THEY MEAN

LIKE CLAIMING THAT BECAUSE THE PYTHON INTERPRETER CAN'T RUN PYTHON 2 CODE IT ISN'T TURING COMPLETE THAT'S TOTAL NONSENSE ANY MODERN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS TURING COMPLETE OF COURSE BEING TURING COMPLETE DOESN'T ACTUALLY MEAN THAT MUCH POSTSCRIPT AND BRAINFUCK ARE BOTH TURING COMPLETE AND I DON'T SEE PROGRAMMERS WRITING MANY PROGRAMS IN EITHER OF THEM

IF YOU WANTED TO SPEND THE EFFORT ON IT YOU COULD WRITE A PROGRAM IN PYTHON THAT COULD CORRECTLY RUN ANY PYTHON 2 CODE YOU COULD DO THE SAME FOR ANY LANGUAGE BUT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BOTHER WITH WRITING SUCH AN INTERPRETER IF YOU WANT TO RUN PYTHON 2 CODE IT'S MUCH SIMPLER TO JUST USE THE PYTHON 2 INTERPRETER

HE'S GOT A POINT THAT THE PORTING TOOL CAN'T RELIABLY CONVERT PYTHON 2 PROGRAMS TO RUN ON PYTHON BUT THAT'S USUALLY BECAUSE THOSE PYTHON 2 PROGRAMS ARE BUGGY OR AMBIGUOUS EAST G THEY ONLY WORKED CORRECTLY ON ASCII OR LATIN TEXT AND THEIR PROGRAMMERS JUST NEVER NOTICED THEIR SHORTCOMINGS IF YOU GIVE THEM INPUT THAT CAN'T BE HANDLED IN THEIR ASSUMED ENCODING THEY'LL EITHER CHOKE ON IT OR WORSE SILENTLY GARBLE THE DATA

PYTHON REQUIRES YOU TO BE UP FRONT WITH YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THINGS LIKE ENCODINGS AND IT WILL USUALLY GIVE YOU AN ERROR MESSAGE IF YOU GET IT WRONG UNICODE STRINGS AND BYTE STRINGS ARE NOT THE SAME AND AREN'T ORDINARILY USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES IT MAKES SOME SENSE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE SAME INTERFACES

THIS IS WHAT THE GUY SOMEHOW BELIEVES MEANS THAT STRINGS HAVE SOME WEIRD NEW TYPING SYSTEM NOPE THEY WORK JUST LIKE ANY OTHER TYPES YOU MAY NEED TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE A STR OR A BYTES WHEN DOING OPERATIONS ON THEM BUT THAT'S JUST LIKE HOW YOU MAY ALREADY NEED TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE A LIST OR A DICT SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE SAME INTERFACES AND OF COURSE SOMETIMES YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY USING A SMALL PART OF THEIR COMMON INTERFACE EAST G ITERATING

I'LL ADMIT THAT THE ERROR MESSAGES YOU GET FROM PYTHON ENCODING ERRORS ARE NOT ALWAYS CLEAR BUT THEY'RE BETTER THAN WHAT YOU'D GET IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO WRITE UNICODE AWARE CODE IN PYTHON 2 WHERE YOU CAN GET UNICODEDECODEERROR EXCEPTIONS WHEN TRYING TO ENCODE SOMETHING AND OTHER NON SEQUITURS
LOL WUT

IN ADDITION TO THE BS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED I LIKE HOW HE SAYS IN PYTHON 2 BYTES HELLO HELLO HELLOHELLO BUT NOT IN PYTHON YEAH THAT'S BECAUSE BYTES IS LITERALLY JUST AN ALIAS FOR STR IN PYTHON 2 HE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HELLO U HELLO U HELLOHELLO IN PYTHON 2 IT WOULD STILL BE A BAD ARGUMENT SINCE IT ISN'T VERY GOOD BEHAVIOR IMO BUT HE DIDN'T IN FACT HIS MISTAKE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHY PYTHON 2 S UNICODE STR PROBLEM NEEDED TO BE FIXED IN PYTHON
TL R DUDE WROTE HIS COURSE IN DOES NOT WANT TO UPDATE IT PICKING UP PER BOOK VERY POPULAR STILL RECOMMENDED BY SOME MANIACS CASH ROLLING IN WHY CHANGE MAKES PRETTIER CSS AND WRITES SHITTY ARTICLES WHICH TOOK LONGER THAN TO RUN HIS COURSE THROUGH OR SED TO APPROVE HIS LAZINESS

JUST MOVE ALONG GUY HAD A SCHTICK FOR BEING THAT EGOMANIAC ARROGANT PROGRAMMER FOR PR BUT IT SEEMS THAT HE BECAME ONE

HE'S TOO LAZY TO UPDATE HIS COURSES PROBABLY EASIER TO TALK BULLSHIT AND WRITE INSANELY INCORRECT ARTICLES TO SELL HIS OUTDATED COURSES THAN TO UPDATE LINES OF CODE

HIS COURSES ARE FOR BEGINNERS THERE'S ALMOST NOTHING TO CHANGE IN THERE MOSTLY CHANGE PRINT STATEMENTS TO FUNCTIONS AND MOVE ALONG EASIER TO WRITE SUPER IN OOP PART ETC COULD EXTEND COURSES WITH NEW PYTHON STUFF LIKE ASYNCIO AS WELL I AM NOT SURE IF THERE ARE GENERATORS ITERATORS IN HIS COURSE SO HE COULD EXTEND THERE AS WELL AS IN PYTHON THEY ARE MORE COMMONLY USED AND USUALLY MAKE LIFE MUCH EASIER

JUST LOOK HERE

PYTHON HE EVEN DOES NOT UPDATE TO

LAST LOGIN SAT APR ON ATYS
PYTHON
PYTHON FEB
SOME PEOPLE GO SO FAR AS TO BAN MY BOOK BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SUPPORT PYTHON EVEN THOUGH MY BOOK IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR LEARNING TO CODE

ARROGANT MUCH EVEN IF THAT WERE TRUE IT'S TOTALLY UNPROVABLE

THE REST OF THE ARTICLE IS VERGING ON INSANE I USED TO RECOMMEND LPTHW BUT I'M NOT SURE I SHOULD ANY MORE
LET'S ALL PROMISE TO JUST IGNORE ZED HE JUMPED THE SHARK AGES AGO
IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THEIR STRINGS MORE INTERNATIONAL THEY TURNED THEM INTO DIFFICULT TO USE TYPES WITH POOR ERROR MESSAGES

THIS LINE IS THE MOST OFFENSIVE ONE FOR ME BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT SHAW NEVER EVER DEALT WITH DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAN ENGLISH OR EMODINS BECAUSE CUSTOMERS WILL PASTE EVERY KIND OF SHIT INTO FORMULAR
STARTUP I WORK FOR USES PYTHON SINCE FEW YEARS AND THERE IS NO POINT FOR US TO USE PYTHON 2 SINCE LONG TIME INITIAL PYTHON MIGRATION REQUIRED FEW PULL REQUESTS BUT THAT WAS DOABLE WITHOUT PROBLEMS
AARGH WHAT CRAP ARTICLE FULL OF REPLETIVE CLAIMS RANTS AND NONSENSE THAT DOES A REALLY BAD SERVICE FOR THE CAUSE IT ADDRESS VERY HARD TO TAKE IT SERIOUS AND IT REALLY DOESN'T HELP THAT HE CONSTANTLY PRETENDS THAT PYTHON IS HARD FOR BEGINNERS YET MOST PROBLEMS HE HAVE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PYTHON 2 AND NOT EVEN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF

I SEEMS HE HAS MORE PISSED ON THE FACT THAT HIS OUTDATED TUTORIAL IS BECOMING USELESS AND HE CAN'T ANYMORE EARN MONEY WITH IT TILL HE REWORKS IT PROBABLY LOST SOME THROUGH REFUNDING
IF I COULDN'T USE PYTHON RELIABLY THEN THERE'S NO WAY A TOTAL BEGINNER COULD MANAGE IT

LOL DID ZED SHAW JUST ADMIT HE IS A BEGINNER THIS GUY IS A JOKE
THERE IS NO CASE ANYMORE
THE AUTHOR OF THIS ARTICLE SAYS ABOUT TYPING THAT MEANS I DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW THE TYPE OF VARIABLE TO USE IT
THIS IS NOT REALLY TRUE IF THE TYPE OF A VARIABLE IS STRING THEN YOU CAN'T DO ARITHMETIC ON IT BECAUSE PYTHON IS IT'S NOT STATICALLY TYPED BUT IT IS STRONGLY TYPED ANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT FAILS TO PRESENT BEGINNERS WITH STRONG TYPING IS A BAD LANGUAGE TO START WITH IMO BOTH PYTHON 2 SHARE THE SAME APPROACH TO TYPING PERSONALLY I ENJOY CODING PYTHON MUCH MORE BECAUSE OF THE FAIRLY ELEGANT I ONLY USE PYTHON FOR MY PROJECTS ON WINDOWS AND LINUX AND IT'S FINE THERE IS HARDLY ANY STUFF NOT PORTED TO AS LONG AS YOU'RE HAPPY WITH AND WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE
THE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS IN PYTHON SEEM VERY PROMISING
THE ABSTRACTION REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNICODE STRINGS AND BYTES DOESN'T SEEM VERY CHALLENGING TO ME IF YOU CAN'T MASTER SUCH A BASIC ABSTRACTION YOU WILL CERTAINLY STRUGGLE WITH MODERN PROGRAMMING IN ANY LANGUAGE INCLUDING MANY OTHER PARTS OF PYTHON I SUSPECT THAT IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE AN ISSUE IF YOU HAVE NEVER EXPECTED CHARACTERS AND BYTES TO BE THE SAME AFTER ALL WE ARE ALL QUITE HAPPY DEALING WITH NUMERIC TYPES WHICH ARE ABSTRACTIONS OF IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS WE MOSTLY DON'T CARE ABOUT

AT PRESENT THIS CODE JUST SCREAMS INTRO TO PROGRAMMING THERE'S A LOT OF VERY BAD CODE AND A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE ALMOST EVERYWHERE

PY
FIRST IT'S LIKELY MORE SUITED THAT A CARD DECK AND GAME SHOULD BE SEPARATE CLASSES A CARD WOULD HAVE ALL THE TYPICAL ATTRIBUTES OF A CARD CARD NUMBER NETTER AND CARD COLOUR IT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE A VALUE SINCE THAT WILL VARY BASED ON THE GAME LET THE GAME DECIDE THIS

A DECK WILL BE A COLLECTION OF CARDS WITH METHODS TO SHUFFLE DEAL ADD CARDS REMOVE CARDS ETC IE THINGS YOU WOULD DO WITH A DECK

A GAME WOULD HAVE THE RULES OF THE GAME CARD VALUES HOW MANY DECKS PLAYERS ETC

FURTHERMORE THERE'S A LOT OF POOR CODE BEING USED AT PRESENT THERE'S NO GOOD WAY TO HAVE MORE THEN THE FOUR BASIC SUITS OR TWO COLOURS WHAT IF I WANT WHEELS AND RACKETS

THE ENTIRE DECK CARD CARD IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF MY STATEMENT EVERYTHING IS WITH ZERO OPTIONS FOR CUSTOMIZATION

INSTEAD CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING

FROM ITERTOOLS IMPORT PRODUCT

SUITS SPADES CLUBS HEARTS DIAMONDS
VALUES 2 J Q K A
CARDS LIST PRODUCT SUITS VALUES

SUDDENLY GAMES LIKE EUCHRE BECOME POSSIBLE VERY EASILY BY OVERWRITING SUITS VALUES WHEN THE DECK IS BEING CREATED


PY
THERE'S JUST A TON OF QUESTIONS WHY DOES THE PLAYER CLASS INHERIT FROM THE CLASS A PLAYER IS NOT AN EXTENSION SUBSET OF THE BLACK JACK GAME WHY IS THE DEALER CLASS NOT A SUBCLASS OF THE PLAYER CLASS ARE BLACK JACKS AND NON RESOLVED DIFFERENTLY THIS COULD ALL BE MERGED AND CODE MADE MUCH SIMPLER

ALL OF THIS JUST REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE LACK OF PLANNING UNDERSTANDING OF OBJECTS AND GOOD SUCCINCT CODE WRITING THE REST OF THE CODE HAS MANY FURTHER EXAMPLES OF THIS TOO BUT I'M NOT REALLY GOING TO GET INTO IT
PYTHONGUY BLOB MASTER CARD

SORRY THIS IS HORRIBLE CODE
HAVE YOU LOOKED AT WHETHER YOUR CHOSEN RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR HAS ENOUGH ENTROPY RANDOMNESS TO SHUFFLE A CARD DECK AS FAR AS I KNOW THE NORMAL DEFAULT PYTHON LIBRARY CANNOT UNIQUELY SHUFFLE A CARD DECK I EAST CANNOT POSSIBLE GENERATE EVERY POSSIBLE COMBINATION IT MIGHT NOT BE IMPORTANT BUT IT MIGHT BE ONLY YOU CAN TELL
PERHAPS A BIT OFF TOPIC BUT THIS IS A PYTHON SOLIDARE PROGRAM

THANKS FOR POSTING THIS I'M ALWAYS CONFUSED ABOUT WHY OTHER LANGUAGES GET SO EXCITED ABOUT CLOSURES MAKES ME THINK I SHOULD BE TRYING TO USE THEM MORE IN PYTHON
YOU COULD ALSO USE A LIBRARY WITH EVEN MORE OUT OF THE BOX SUCH AS EASILY SENDING ATTACHMENTS AND HEML IT ALSO HAS A CONTEXT MANAGER IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING I WROTE A POST DISCLAIMER I WROTE BOTH THE POST AND THE LIBRARY

EXAMPLE CODE

FROM YAGMAIL IMPORT SMTP
WITH SMTP USER PW AS AAG
SOMEONE CONTENTS BIG TITLE
ATTACHMENTS

YOU CAN ALSO USE THE KEYING TO AVOID HAVING TO HAVE YOUR UNDERNAME PW IN YOUR SCRIPTURE
HOW DO I ATTACH A FILE I'VE BUILT IN MEMORY SAY A ZIPFILE OF DOCUMENTS THAT A USER HAD REQUESTED
IT SEEMS THAT YOU COULD SAVE A LOT OF HASSLE BY SPENDING MORE TIME BUILDING SOMETHING IN PURE PYTHON TO INPUT TO PANDAS THAN CREATING THE DATAFRAME STEP BY STEP THIS ALSO MAKES THE CODE MORE PORTABLE BECAUSE YOU DON'T START WITH PANDAS AS A DEPENDENCY A GENERATOR IS PERFECT IN THIS SITUATION

TO BE CURIOUS WHY ARE YOU DOING MONEY MATH WITH FLOATS INSTEAD OF DECIMAL OBJECTS

YES IT'S SLOWER BUT IT'S DESIGNED TO BE ACCURATE WITH DISCRETE VALUES LIKE MONEY
EXECUTABLE BUILD DESCRIPTIONS ARE A BAD IDEA IMHO IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME

PEOPLE START TO FIX THEIR BROKEN PROJECT LAYOUT IN THEIR BUILD FILES INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING CONVENTIONS THEY GET LAZY AND TRY TO BE SMART JUST TO NOT HAVE TO TYPE SOME EXPLICIT DEPENDENCIES THEY PUT WAY TO MUCH LOGIC INTO SOMETHING THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE STATIC THIS RESULTS IN PLATFORM OR DEPENDENT BUILDS THAT BREAK ALL THE TIME AND ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE RELIABLY THE IT'S BUILDING ON MY COMPUTER SYNDROME
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PARSE THESE FILES WITHOUT EXECUTING THEM WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE WITH THE EXACT VERSION INSTALLED IN ORDER TO REPRODUCE A BUILD OR JUST ANALYSES A SOURCE PACKAGE BISTRO PACKAGE MAINTAINERS WILL LOVE YOU FOR THAT
IF THE BUILD SYSTEM EVOLVES YOU CANNOT AUTOMATICALLY MIGRATE OLD BUILD DESCRIPTIONS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT KNOW WHAT DIRTY TRICKS THE DEVELOPER MAY HAVE PUT INTO THEM YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY FOR ALL TIME OR BREAK IT AND BREAK BUILDS IN THE PROCESS WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO KEEP OUTDATED POSSIBLY INSECURE VERSIONS OF THE BUILD SYSTEM AVAILABLE IF YOU WANT TO BUILD SOURCE PACKAGES PACKAGING HELL HERE IT COMES

I'M NOT TALKING EXCLUSIVELY ABOUT PYTHON ITS THE SAME IN ALL ECOSYSTEMS SOME PROJECTS GET IT RIGHT PYTHON WHEELS RUST CARGO BUT IN MOST OTHER ECOSYSTEMS THAT ALLOW TURING COMPLETE BUILD DESCRIPTIONS YOU SEE THE SAME PROBLEMS BUILDING STUFF GROWS MORE COMPLICATED OVER TIME THE BUILD SYSTEMS GET BLOATED SLOW AND UNMAINTAINABLE AND YOU HAVE A NEW BUILD SYSTEM EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS JAVA ANT MAVEN CRADLE JS WETBACK AND SO ON

TL R

EDIT SOME LINKS WITH MORE DISCUSSIONS

DISCOURAGING OVERLY COMPLEX PIPILE DEFINITIONS
CLARIFY THAT A PIPILE IS A TOOL TO GENERATE AND NOT A BUILD DESCRIPTION ON ITS OWN
IT WILL BE VERY HARD FOR TOOLS IDES TO CHANGE DEPENDENCIES PROGRAMMATICALLY
RISK OF OUTDATED AFTER EDITING PIPILE
EXECUTABLE FILE FORMAT YES OR NO

EDIT 2
I'VE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCED THAT THE USE CASE FOR WANTING NEEDING FULL PYTHON POWERS IS SUFFICIENTLY WEIRD THAT IT'S NOT WORTH TRYING TO KEEP IT OVER OTHER BENEFITS AT THIS POINT I THINK IT COMES DOWN TO A DSW REALLY JUST A RESTRICTED SUBSET VIA AST PARSING OR A STATIC FILE OF SOME KIND

I'M HAPPY WITH THAT EVERYTHING ELSE SAML COML JASON IS


IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME INITIALLY BUT THIS IS AN ACTUAL PROJECT BY THE DEVELOPERS OF PIP THIS WILL EVENTUALLY BE BAKED INTO PIP

WHAT'S SCARY TO ME IS HOW LITTLE DISCUSSION I CAN FIND ABOUT THIS PYTHON LANGUAGE CHANGES ARE ACCOMPANIED BY PROPOSAL DOCUMENTS FILLED WITH RATIONALES ALTERNATIVES ETC PEOPLE THEN DISCUSS THE PROPOSAL AND EDITS ARE MADE UNTIL A FINAL VERSION IS AGREED UPON BY THE CORE DEVS OR IT'S REJECTED WITHDRAWN

HERE WE HAVE A TINY BIT OF DISCUSSION SCATTERED ACROSS SOME GISTS AND GITHUB ISSUES AND THEN SOMEONE STARTED SOLIDIFYING IT INTO CODE
WHAT DOES THIS DO THAT OF CANNOT

COLLECTS AND LOCKS REQUIREMENTS OF REQUIREMENTS INCL THEIR VERSIONS DOES PIPILE DO THAT TOO IN THE EXAMPLES IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT
I DON'T LIKE THIS ON THE SLIGHTEST SEEMS LIKE FIXING SOMETHING THAT ISNT BROKEN
CAN SOMEONE ELI WHAT THIS IS ABOUT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING DISCUSSED
OH GOD THE PYTHON WEB STACK FOLKS ARE ON THEIR WAY TO FUCK IT ALL UP AGAIN PLEASE GET SOME SCIENTIFIC PYTHON FOLKS THAT ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT NATIVE CODE AND BUILD ISSUES AS FOUNDING CONTRIBUTORS SO YOU DON'T SHIT THE BED FOR THE 4TH TIME
IF IT DOESN'T SUPPORT INSTALLATION OF DEPENDENCIES FROM LOCAL FILES THEN IT SUCKS JUST LIKE THE CURRENT SOLUTIONS WHY EVERYONE ALWAYS ASSUMES EVERY PACKAGE A PIECE OF SOFTWARE DEPENDS ON IS ON PEPI OR EQUIVALENT INTERNET SOURCE OR DID I MISS THE MEMO AND IT IS ONLY ALLOWED TO DO COMMUNITY AND OPEN SOURCE WORK IN PYTHON
A LOCK WOULD BE ALWAYS SUCKS WHEN A MAINTAINER DOESN'T FOLLOW SEAVER AND I HAVE TO DIG THROUGH COMPILED ASSETS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CHANGED OTHERWISE THIS SMELLS LIKE A FIX FOR SOMETHING THAT SIMPLY ISN'T BROKEN
AM I MISSING SOMETHING OR IS THERE JUST NOTHING IN THE REPO ASIDE FROM PROMISES
GIVE ME CARGO FOR PYTHON AND I'M SET EXECUTABLE DEFINITION IS PROBABLY A BAD IDEA BUT THE LOCK FILE IS PURE GOLD
I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE RELYING ON WHY NOT USE OPTION IN IT SEEMS TO HAVE ALL OF BENEFITS THIS IS IMPLEMENTING AND THE DEPENDENCIES ARE ALSO ENFORCED IN WHEELS CREATED

IS IMO ONLY USEFUL WHEN YOU WANT TO RECREATE THE SAME SETUP A DEVELOPER HAD AND FOR THAT CASE YOU DO WANT FILE TO BE STATIC
I'VE BEEN USING FOR A WHILE NOW AND AM VERY SATISFIED WITH IT
IF THIS MAKE THE INSTALL OF LOCAL PACKAGES BETTER THAN THE MESS THAT PIP OFFERS NOW THEN I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED
JUST WHAT WE NEED ANOTHER WAY OF DOING THE SAME THING

WHY NOT JUST USE TOX
GREAT TO HEAR IT IS MAINTAINED AGAIN

ONE PROBLEM I ALWAYS HAD WITH LIVESTREAMER WAS SKIPPING INTO A TWITCH VOD TWITCH ITSELF ACCEPTS TIME OFFSETS IN THE NRL T AND SIMILAR BUT LIVESTREAMER WOULD JUST IGNORE THAT AND RUN IT FROM THE START TYPICALLY I TO SKIP AT LEAST MINUTES IN FOR THE STREAM TO START DOES STREAMLINE FIX THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE
I HEARD ABOUT TINYDB RECENTLY ON TALKPYTHON AS WELL BUT I HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE ANY OF THESE YET
I'M THE MAINTAINER OF DJONDB HAPPY TO HELP AND ALWAYS OPEN TO RECEIVE FEEDBACK I'VE CREATED THIS FOR MY PERSONAL PROJECTS THEN REALIZED THAT OTHER PEOPLE MAY WANTED TO HAVE A NORSEL SUPPORTING TRANSACTIONS IT WILL BE ALWAYS FREE TO USE I LOVE PYTHON AND I'VE CREATED A COUPLE OF PROJECTS USING THE PYTHON DRIVER LET ME KNOW IF YOU THINK IT'S USEFUL AND ANY IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATION IS ALWAYS APPRECIATED
HAVEN'T READ THE READE YET DOES SOUND DATA GO OUT TO THE INTERNET IN SOME WAY LIKE GOOGLE OR SOMETHING I DON'T LIKE THE THOUGHT OF KNOWING THAT ANYTHING I SAY AT HOME IS TRANSMITTED TO SOME COMPANY OR SOMEONE ELSE WHO DOESN'T BELONG TO MY PRIVATE SPACE
HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO CHANGE NAMES VOICES I WANT A JARVIS FOR MY SHOP

HAVE YOU GOTTEN IT WORKING WITH BLUETOOTH HEADSET

I ASSUME IT WORKS JUST FINE ON DESKTOP MACHINES
IN REGARDS TO FUNCTIONALITY HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO AMAZON'S ALEXA
VERY QUICK INTRO BUT THATS IT

I CAN ALSO RECOMMEND TO USE CSS SELECTORS THAT WILL BE FASTER AS LONG AS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO SELECTION

HERE IS AN EXAMPLE
SOFTWARE BEAUTIFULSOUP DOC
IF YOU WANT TO SEARCH FOR TAGS THAT MATCH TWO OR MORE CSS CLASSES YOU SHOULD USE A CSS SELECTOR
SELECT

I HAVE DONE SOME QUICK N DIRTY PERFORMANCE TEST FOR MY RPI SCRAPER WHERE IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT FINDAL ETC WILL MAKE YOU ITERATE A LOT AND THAT CONSUMES CPU LAMEL PATH AND CSS SELECTOR IS MUCH FASTER
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO USE REQUESTS INSTEAD OF URLLIB
HEY I'VE ACTUALLY USED THIS A PAIN TO GET SETUP BUT VERY USEFUL
FOR THE EXAMPLE OF A TITLE TAG STRING WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE THAN TEXT THE TEXT PROPERTY CONCATENATES ALL CHILD STRINGS TOGETHER WHICH LOSES NODE INFORMATION AND COULD BE MORE RESOURCE INTENSIVE THE STRING PROPERTY RECURSIVELY FINDS THE FIRST CHILD STRING NODE IF ALL CHILDREN ARE ONLY CHILDREN
AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION SHOULD BE TWO DIFFERENT SERVICES YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK PERMISSIONS FOR A USER THAT IS NOT LOGGED IN FOR EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT BACKGROUND TASKS THAT WORK ON BEHALF OF A USER
WE'RE CURRENTLY THINKING THROUGH SOME OF THESE SAME THINGS WE'VE DECIDED FOR NOW TO HAVE A SERVICE THAT ONLY HANDLES AUTHENTICATION IT THEN ISSUES A TOKEN BWT WHICH ALLOWS ANY OF OUR OTHER SERVICES TO IDENTIFY THE AUTHENTICATED USER I EAST THE VERIFIED TOKEN PROVES THAT THIS IS THE USER BOB

EACH OTHER SERVICE WOULD THEN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE AUTHORIZATION PERMISSIONS OF THAT PARTICULAR USER FOR ITSELF I EAST IS THE USER BOB ALLOWED TO MODIFY THIS DATA I RECALL THAT THIS LINES UP WITH MUCH OF WHAT I READ ON THE SUBJECT THOUGH I HAVE NO LINKS AT HAND TO SUPPORT MY THINKING

ONE IDEA WE ARE KICKING AROUND IS HAVING THE AUTHENTICATION SERVICE ALSO ROLL GROUP MEMBERSHIP INFORMATION INTO THE RETURNED TOKEN WHICH SOME SERVICES MAY USE IN THEIR PROCESS FOR DETERMINING AUTHORIZATION I EAST THIS IS THE USER BOB AND HE IS IN THE GROUP ADMINISTRATORS CURRENTLY OUR AUTHENTICATION SERVICE QUERIES OUR ACTIVE DIRECTORY SO THIS IDEA FEELS PRETTY NATURAL

GRANTED WE'RE STILL IN THE EARLY PHASES OF CONSIDERING THIS ARCHITECTURE SHIFT AT MY ORGANIZATION SO I AM ALSO CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT SOME MORE SEASONED MEMBERS RESPOND WITH
HAD A SIMILAR DILEMMA RECENTLY WOUND UP WITH AN AUTHENTICATION SERVICE AND A SEPARATE PERMISSIONS SERVICE IT'S A BIT OF A BEAR TO DEAL WITH AT TIMES BUT WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN MOST OF OUR OTHER SERVICES USE THE PERMISSIONS SERVICE BUT DON'T CARE ABOUT THE AUTHENTICATION SERVICE SO ITS LOGICAL FOR THEM TO BE SEPARATE SERVICES
PYTHON IS CASE SENSITIVE USE INSTEAD OF
YOU SHOULD REALLY PROVIDE CRITERIA FOR WHAT YOU WANT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXCLUDING ALL OF THE MOST COMMON METHODS BECAUSE YOU WANT NEED SOMETHING ELSE WHY IS PIP FREEZE OR HELP MODULES INSUFFICIENT

IF YOU WANT TO RECREATE WHAT PIP DOES REVIEW ITS SOURCE CODE AND RECREATE THAT FUNCTIONALITY YOURSELF WITH TOOLS THAT FIT YOUR REQUIREMENTS
PIP FREEZE SHOWS ALL THE INSTALLED PACKAGES
NOT SURE WHAT I'M SEEING BUT IT'S PRETTY NEAT
HAHA LET ME EXPLAIN YOU THE STORY BEHIND THIS GIF IMAGE

THIS IMAGE IS GENERATED BY A PYTHON SCRIPT NO LIB SOFTWARE NOR PIL GRAPHICS MODULES JUST PURE PYTHON THERE IS NO DRAWING COMMAND IN IT

THIS IMAGE SHOWS YOU HOW ALGORITHM WORKS ON A 2D GRID SO TO UNDERSTAND THIS IMAGE YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THIS AGO FIRST

CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING PROBLEM GIVEN A FINITE CONNECTED GRAPH G G MIGHT HAVE MANY SPANNING TREES HOW CAN WE CHOOSE ONE FROM THEM WITH UNIFORM PROBABILITY

WILSON AGO SAYS
CHOOSE ANY VERTEX V AND MAINTAIN A TREE TENSE INITIALLY T V
2 FOR ANY VERTEX W WITH W NOT IN T START A LOOP ERASED RANDOM WALK FROM W
UNTIL THE WALK HITS T THEN ADD THE RESULT PATH TO TENSE
REPEAT STEP 2 UNTIL ALL VERTICES ARE IN T THEN THE FINAL T WILL BE WE WANT
THIS ALGORITHM IS SHORT IN WORDS BUT QUITE TRICKY TO PROVE AND THE PROOF IN ORIGINAL PAPER WOULD TAKE ONE MORE THAN A FEW DAYS TO UNDERSTAND AND EVEN MORE TIME TO ABSORB IT

BUT IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO IMPLEMENT INTO CODE THE FIRST ANIMATION I SAW WAS MIKE AWESOME JS ANIMATION WHICH INSPIRED ME TO MAKE MY OWN ANIMATION OF WILSON ALGORITHM BUT WITH PYTHON

PYTHON HAS ITS GRAPHICS MODULES LIKE PREGAME PEGLET TINTER AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT ONE CAN USE THESE LIBS TO MAKE HIS ANIMATION BUT WHAT I WANT IS A GIF VERSION THE FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO IMPLEMENT IT IN PEGLET PREGAME AND THEN SAVE MANY FRAMES INTO ANG IMAGES AND THEN CONVERT THEM INTO A GIF FILE BUT THIS WAY IS VERY VERY INEFFICIENT

FOR A REASONABLE SIZE CELLS THE ANIMATION WOULD CONTAINS SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF FRAMES SAVING SO MANY FRAMES INTO IMAGE FILES IN DISK AND READ THEM BACK WOULD BE A HORRIBLE TASK

I'M NOT SURE IF OTHER GIF TOOLS CAN BE SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THERE ARE ONLY COLORS IN THE ANIMATION AND SET THE MINIMAL CODE LENGTH TO I HAVE SEEN MANY IMPLEMENTATIONS USE BIT LENGTH AS DEFAULT

SO I HACKED INTO THE GIF CODING STANDARD GIF AND MANUALLY ENCODED EACH FRAME INTO BYTE STREAMS WITH LAW ENCODING BY RECORDING EACH WINDOW SIZE THIS APPROACH IS COMPARABLY SUCCINCT AND FAST FOR A VERSION I GOT FRAMES BUT ONLY FILE SIZE

THE CODE IS ON MY GITHUB REPO IT'S NOT COMMENTED YET AND NOT VERY CLEAN I HAVE JUST FINISHED IT JUST THIS AFTERNOON BUT IT WILL BE CLEANER SOON

HOPE YOU LIKE IT AND DON'T FORGET STAR THE REPO

BTW CURRENTLY THE CODE ONLY WORKS FOR PYTHON NOT PYTHON I'LL LOOK BACK TO THE CODE LATER

I'D LIKE TO SEE THE CODE OF THIS IF ITS UP ANYWHERE
COOL STUFF OP NICE JOB RIDING THE GIF FORMAT BAREBACK

FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO READ PAPER REF THAT WAS YEARS AGO AND IT WAS A BIG DEAL STILL IS I THINK WILSON IS A MICROSOFT RESEARCHER NOW

THIS AGO SEEMS VERY INEFFICIENT GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIMES IT JUST RETRIES EACH PATH OVER AND OVER AND OVER

I WROTE A QUICK FLASK EXAMPLE APP LAST WEEK WHERE YOU CAN CALL SCRAPY PROGRAMMATICALLY WITHIN A VIEW HANDLER FUNCTION JUST AN EXAMPLE SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION
THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE DONE MYSELF AND IT WORKED OUT WELL FOR ME

SOME NOTES THOUGH

DON'T RAISE SYSTEMEXIT IF YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST EXIT THE PROGRAM CALL OTHERWISE GIVE THE USER A CHANCE TO HANDLE THE EXCEPTION IN A SANE WAY

IT'S TRIVIAL TO DEFINE A NEW EXCEPTION AND IF IT'S NOT HANDLED IT WILL JUST BUBBLE UP AND EXIT THE PROGRAM ANYWAY WITH A STACK TRACE ATTACHED

CLASS NOTLOGGEDINEXCEPTION EXCEPTION
PASS

2 YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HANG ON TO A PASSWORD LONGER THAN YOU HAVE TO ALSO GETTING A PASSWORD FROM THE USER DOESN'T MEAN IT'S ACCEPTED BY THE SYSTEM YOU SHOULD GET A NONCE OR SESSION ID OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE THEN YOU CAN CONSIDER THE USER TO BE AUTHENTICATED

RETURN THE VALUE FROM DUNC ON LINE
IT'S A FINE WAY TO DO IT BUT YOU PROBABLY WANT TO SEND A FORBIDDEN RESPONSE RATHER THAN CRASH YOUR PROGRAM
I WROTE A SIMILAR PROGRAM A COUPLE YEARS AGO IT DIDN'T HAVE THE STIPULATION THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO PAIRS BUT IT DID MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE FROM ONE GROUP DIDN'T MATCH WITH PEOPLE IN ANOTHER GROUP

I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS ACTUALLY AN PROBLEM SOMEONE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT MY SOLUTION WORKED WELL FOR ME I WAS DOING THIS WITH A RATHER SMALL GROUP SO WHAT I WOULD DO IS I WOULD COME UP WITH A RANDOMIZED MATCHING AND SEE IF IT PASSED ALL OF MY RULES IF IT FAILED FOR SOME REASON I'D RESHUFFLE AND TRY AGAIN IF IT PASSED ALL OF MY RULES I USED IT AS A SOLUTION THIS MAY NOT BE EFFICIENT OR ELEGANT BUT IF YOU HAVE A SMALLISH GROUP IT SHOULD WORK JUST FINE

DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF BRUTE FORCING AND DON'T PREMATURELY OPTIMIZE EVEN IF YOUR NAIVE SOLUTION TAKES AN HOUR OF RUNTIME IT'S STILL FASTER THAN AN SOLUTION ALGORITHM IF IT TAKES YOU AN HOUR TO WRITE THE FANCY CODE
THIS SOUNDS LIKE AN OPTIMIZATION CONSTRAINT FITTING PROBLEM

IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR PROBLEM IS COMPATIBLE WITH SOMETHING CALLED PARTIAL SOLUTIONS MEANING YOU CAN HAVE SOME OF A SOLUTION AND CHECK IF JUST THAT IS VALID

YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO A GUESS AND CHECK WITH BACKTRACKING SOLUTION BACKTRACKING IS OFTEN IMPLEMENTED RECURSIVELY THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT YOU ARE INTELLIGENTLY CHECKING EVERY POSSIBLE SOLUTION BUILDING PARTIAL SOLUTIONS AS YOU GO ALONG THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT INSTEAD OF TRUE BRUTE FORCE YOU SIMPLY NEVER PURSUE A PARTIAL SOLUTION AS SOON AS ANY PART OF IT FAILS ONE OF YOUR CONSTRAINTS

I KNOW ALL THIS SOUNDS A BIT ABSTRACT THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE GIVES A GOOD BACKGROUND AND SHOULD GIVE YOU A GENERAL IDEA FOR AN APPROACH IT YOU WANT TO TRY BACKTRACKING
I'D ROLL WITH BRUTE FORCE RANDOMIZE THE PAIRINGS CHECK IF THE OUTCOME MATCHES YOUR CRITERIA LOOP UNTIL THINGS MATCH

IF THAT DOESN'T PERFORM I'D GO GENETIC THAT IS START WITH A RANDOMIZED SOLUTION ATTEMPT FIND RULE VIOLATIONS AND FIX THEM WITH RANDOM SWAPS TAKE ONE PERSON FROM AN OFFENDING PAIR AND SWAP THEM FOR A RANDOM PERSON FROM ANOTHER PAIR THEN AFTER EACH SWAP CHECK IF THE SITUATION IS NOW BETTER OR WORSE USE THAT TO WEIGH A COIN TOSS ON WHETHER YOU SHOULD ROLL BACK OR NOT REPEAT UNTIL SOLVED AFTER TOO MANY ITERATIONS TO AVOID GETTING STUCK

AND FINALLY YOU COULD USE ALGORITHM TO PERFORM A TREE SEARCH RANDOMIZE ADD ALL POSSIBLE SWAPS TO YOUR LIST KEEP SEARCHING INTO THE BRANCH CULL BRANCHES THAT RUN IN CIRCLES LOWEST NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS IS YOUR SCORING METRIC

YOU COULD IN FACT EVEN APPLY USING NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS AS THE HEURISTIC ASSUMING THAT EVERY VIOLATION TAKES AT LEAST ONE SWAP TO FIX HOWEVER IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A SWAP TO SOLVE TWO OR EVEN THREE VIOLATIONS SO YOU MAY HAVE TO DIVIDE YOUR SCORE BY 2 OR
MOST FUN WILL BE IF YOU MAKE IT INTO ONE BIG CYCLE A B C D E F Z A IF SO YOUR FIRST REQUIREMENT IS AUTOMATICALLY SATISFIED UNLESS YOU ONLY HAVE TWO PEOPLE AND YOUR SECOND REQUIREMENT JUST SAYS THAT PEOPLE NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN THE CYCLE NEED TO BE FROM DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS

I'D START FROM AN APPROACH LIKE

PICK THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE MOST PEOPLE AND SPREAD THEM EVENLY OVER THE CYCLE EAST G IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE AND THE BIGGEST DEPARTMENT HAS PEOPLE PUT THEM AT 10TH POSITION
2 IF THERE ARE STILL DEPARTMENTS TO PLACE GO TO

UNLESS THE BIGGEST DEPARTMENT IS MORE THAN HALF OF THE ALL PEOPLE AND IN THIS CASE NO SOLUTION IS POSSIBLE I THINK THIS SHOULD WORK
SORRY IF I MISUNDERSTOOD THE PROBLEM BUT CAN'T YOU JUST DO THE FOLLOWING

SHUFFLE EVERY DEPARTMENT LIST

2 PULL THE NAMES FROM THE SHUFFLED LISTS IN A FASHION INTO A LIST AND USE THAT LIST AS PAIRINGS

FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SHUFFLED DEPARTMENT LISTS A B C YOU CAN JUST DO THIS

PROPS FOR RESISTING THE TEMPTATION OF TRYING TO ROLL YOUR OWN CSF PARSER
WHAT ARE THE MAIN BENEFITS COMPARED TO THE STANDARD LIBRARY CSF MODULE
THIS WILL LIKELY BE AN UNPOPULAR OPINION BUT I REALLY DISLIKE THIS API DOCS LEAD TO PEOPLE NOT WRITING ACTUAL DOCUMENTATION PROSE SOMETHING I'VE NOTICED ESPECIALLY IN GALANG AND TO SOME DEGREE IN THE JS WORLD WHERE THERE'S BARELY ANY PROSE DOCUMENTATION SO EVERYTHING IS DOCUMENTED IN A SENSE THAT IT TELLS YOU WHAT THE FUNCTION NAMES ETC ARE BUT NOTHING TELLS YOU WHY YOU SHOULD USE A CERTAIN FUNCTION OR HOW THE WHOLE THING FITS TOGETHER

I'M A HUGE FAN OF READTHEDOCS BECAUSE IT MADE WRITING DOCUMENTATION A LOT EASIER AND TAKING AWAY SOME OF THE EXCUSES WE MAKE UP FOR OURSELVES NOT TO WRITE DOCS IS A STEP BACKWARDS IN THAT NOW YOU HAVE AN EXCUSE THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DOCUMENTED YOUR LIBRARY BECAUSE IT'S ON

HOPEFULLY I'LL BE PROVEN WRONG AND PEOPLE WILL ONLY USE THIS ON TOP OF CTD
VERY COOL I'M INTERESTED IN HOW WELL THIS WORKS OUT IN TERMS OF QUALITY AND HOW MANY PROJECTS ACTUALLY USE DOCSTRINGS ON PEPI EDIT AT A GLANCE FINALLY GOT ON THESE DOCS REMIND ME OF THE TIMES WHEN I WOULD HAVE TO READ DOCUMENTATION FROM POORLY DOCUMENTED JAVA APIS BUT WORSE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TYPES I THINK FOR SOME OF THESE LIBRARIES I'D RATHER JUST READ THE SOURCE CODE THAN A FUNCTION STATEMENT WITH NO DOCTORING

BY THE WAY CHROME IS BLOCKING THE FONTS READTHEDOCS IS TRYING TO LOAD FROM BECAUSE THE IS OVER HTTPS BUT THE FONTS ARE BEING REQUESTED OVER HETP

THE LINK TO HTTPS DOESN'T RESOLVE PROPERLY GOING TO HETP REDIRECTS TO HTTPS AND PROPERLY RENDERS THE PAGE HOWEVER
EVEN THOUGH THE GUY DOESN'T SEE MUCH NEED FOR NEW PYTHON CODE MY OPINION IS THAT HE SHOULD JUST START A NEW PROJECT IN PYTHON BE IT A PERSONAL PROJECT OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY REAL WAY TO GET USED TO A TECHNOLOGY IS TO ACTIVELY USE IT
ONE OF THE MOST USELESS ARTICLES I'VE READ IN YEARS
LOOKS NICE I WISH I HAD KNOW ABOUT THIS LAST WEEK BEFORE WRITING
SWEET I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A PACKAGE IN PYTHON TO DO FACTOR ANALYSIS FOR SOME OF THE SURVEYS I'M ANALYZING AT WORK
NO ETHICAL SCIENTIST SHOULD TOUCH THIS DATA
FLAWED DATA FLAWED ANALYSIS
R MILDLYINTERESTING
I FIND ETC A MASSIVE PAIN


I'D RECOMMEND WRITING THIS USING JAVASCRIPT JS SINGLE PAGE APP AND HOSTING IT ON YOUR COMPANY WEBSITE EVERYONE HAS A BROWSER AND THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET CAN BE DIRECTED TO SAVE THE PAGE AS AN ARCHIVE FILE
IN POINT FOR YOU SAY OTHER APP IN WINDOWS ARE YOU SAYING YOU ARE MAKING A CLIENT APPLICATION FOR YOUR PIECE OF HARDWARE THAT NEEDS TO WORK IN WINDOWS

WOULD IT BE AN OPTION FOR YOUR DEVICE TO PROVIDE A WEB INTERFACE THAT YOU COULD IMPLEMENT IN PYTHON
WINDOWS APPLICATIONS ARE USUALLY DISTRIBUTED AS AN INSTALLER NOT A STANDALONE APP EXECUTABLE MAKE AN INSTALLER THAT INCLUDES A PRIVATE EMBEDDED COPY OF PYTHON AND REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WRAP IT INTO A SINGLE EXECUTABLE WITH

THE SHORTCUT WILL START THE APPLICATION USING THE INCLUDED TO AVOID OPENING A CONSOLE WINDOW THE USER NEED NOT KNOW OR CARE IF THE APPLICATION IS WRITTEN IN PYTHON UNLESS THEY ARE IN THE HABIT OF DIGGING INTO THE APPLICATION DIRECTORY


STYLEGUIDE SHOSHONE MAP FILTER IS NOT RECOMMENDED
I'M NOT SURE THAT

FROM ITERTOOLS IMPORT ACCUMULATE
A 2
RESULTS LIST ACCUMULATE A MAX

IS MORE READABLE THAN

A 2
RESULT A
FOR ITEM IN A
MAX ITEM RESULT

I'M LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK FEATURE REQUESTS EXAMPLE USE CASES OR GENERAL COMMENTS ON MY NEW PEPI PACKAGE GLINT

FEEL FREE TO COMMENT HERE OR SUBMIT ISSUES ON GITHUB
DO YOU HAVE ANY EXAMPLES OF THE TYPE OF DATA YOU'VE USED THIS ON

AND IF YOU'RE JUST COMPARING WHY NOT JUST DOING HASHES AND THROW AWAY THE NUMBER
INTERESTING IDEA
HUGE BUT COMPRESSIBLE LOTS OF S

LOTS OF ZEROS ARE YOU STORING INTEGERS IN DECIMAL FORMAT WHY
DETAILS CODE WANNA CHECK OUT
I'D LOVE TO SEE THE SOURCE CODE I'VE BEEN WANTING TO MAKE SOMETHING SIMILAR FOR BASS PRACTICE BUT I'M PRETTY NEW TO CODING
DELETED
COMMENTING FOR POSTERITY
CHECK OUT BOKE
I'VE USED BOKE AND PLATLY PLOTS HAVE MUCH BETTER INTERACTIVITY
NOT RELATED TO PYTHON BUT YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO R SHINY AND R MARKDOWN GREAT FOR DATA VISUALIZATION AND YOU CAN SET UP YOUR OWN SEVER ON UBUNTU
THERE ARE A COUPLE WEB DASHBOARD FRAMEWORKS PYRE AND PIXLEY AND A NEWER VIZ LIBRARY CALLED ALTAIR
TAKE A LOOK AT THE JUPITER INCUBATOR PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY DASHBOARDS AND DECLARATIVE WIDGETS IT'S INCREDIBLY EASY TO USE THESE TO MAKE SIMPLE SINGLE PAGE WEB APPS DIRECTLY FROM A JUPITER NOTEBOOK THEY ALSO HAVE PRECONFIGURED DOCKER CONTAINERS THAT YOU CAN USE TO DEPLOY


PLATLY JUST USE EPLOT INSEA OF PLOT AFTER INSTALLING THEIR STUFF AND ALL THE MAGIC IS DONE FOR YOU
I RECOMMEND BOKE PLATLY IS ALSO NICE AND HAS A FLASK BASED SERVER OPTION CALLED DASH IT'S ALSO FAIRLY EASY TO SAVE MATPLOTLIB AND SERVER THEM A WHILE BACK I BASE ENCODED MATPLOTLIB CHARTS AND SENT THOSE OUT QUICK AND DIRTY
DON'T BOTHER WITH BOKE USE THE JUPITER NOTEBOOK INCLUDED IN THE ANACONDA DISTRIBUTION AND THEN IT WILL DIRECTLY RENDER IT TO HEML
I USE PYGAL BECAUSE IT GENERATES REALLY NICE LOOKING INTERACTIVE AVG FILES YOU CAN INSERT THOSE INTO A WEBPAGE USING A TEMPLATE ENGINE LIKE JINJA 2
FWIW ALTAIR IS BASED ON VEGA LITE WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN HOLISTIC GRAMMAR OF INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS
PLEASE IMMEDIATELY SWITCH THE NAME AWAY FROM F IT HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE USE F AS THE NAME OF A FILE HANDLER ALL THE TIME AND ALSO F DOES NOT DESCRIBE SOMETHING RELATED TO LOGGING AT ALL I WOULD THEN PREFER L AND ACTUALLY LETTER IMPORTS ARE NOT PYTHONIC AT ALL
HOW IS THIS BETTER THAN JUST REDIRECTING PYTHON FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT PYTHON PROVIDES A LOGGING FRAMEWORK
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHT FORWARD YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN ANYTHING JUST ADD A LINE OF CODE WHEN YOU NEED IT AND COMMENT IT OUT OR REMOVE IT WHEN YOU DON'T

ISSUES AND PRS ARE WELCOME
THIS REMINDS ME OF AS REFERED TO BY RAY HETTINGER


IF YOU'RE RUNNING THE PROGRAM WITH PYTHON OR ERIC IS YOU'LL NEED TO INSTALL THE VERSIONS SUCH AS PYTHON BUMPY THE COMMAND YOU LISTED INSTALLS THE PYTHON 2 VERSIONS
REGARDING THE PROBLEM AT HAND IT CAN BE REDUCED TO THREE LINES OF PYTHON

IMPORT BUMPY AS NP
SAMPLE
MEAN

THE SECOND LINE WILL GENERATE A ELEMENT MATRIX OF RANDOM NUMBERS WHILE THE THIRD LINE WILL CALCULATE THE MEAN OVER THE SECOND DIMENSION AXIS OF THE SAMPLE MATRIX
MAKE SURE THAT YOUR IDE IS PICKING UP THE SAME VERSION OF PYTHON THAT THE INSTALLED ALL THOSE PACKAGES IN

OR SKIP THE IDE ENTIRELY USE A TEXT EDITOR AND INSTALL THE PYTHON PACKAGES USING PIP INSTEAD OF THIS IS THE PATH OF LEAST CONFUSION ALTHOUGH IF YOU ARE USED TO USING IDES YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT
PYCHARM IS THE BEST IDE FOR PYTHON IMO JUST A SUGGESTION
YOU HAVE TO INSTALL BUMPY VIA PIP
I'M GOING TO QUOTE AN OLD NIKE AD AND SAY JUST DO IT TRY IT FOR YOURSELF BS IS TRIVIAL TO INSTALL LIKELY FASTER THAN WAITING FOR REDDIN ANSWERS TO SUCH A NICHE QUESTION

NOTE YOU OBVIOUSLY WON'T GET THE LAMEL BACKEND
WHEN I EVALUATED PYTHON STATIC SITE GENERATORS LAST YEAR PELICAN WAS THE ONLY ACTIVELY MAINTAINED ONE THAT DIDN'T MORE OR LESS FORCE A SITE STRUCTURE ON EITHER THE SOURCE FILES OR THE OUTPUT FILES GETTING THE BLUGGY STUFF OUT OF THE WAY REQUIRED A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE AVAILABLE CONFIT SETTINGS BUT ONCE CONFIGURED IT WORKED PRETTY NICELY FOR THIS IT GETS MY

NIKOLA WAS ONE OF MY CONTENDERS BUT IT DIDN'T WORK WELL FOR SITES

I HAVEN'T TRIED LECTOR I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK

SEE ALSO

WOW I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE BEFORE CAN I ASK WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE FOR USING ONE OF THESE OVER FLASK DURANGO

HOW MUCH OF A COMPETITOR TO WORDPRESS IS IT
SPHINX
I BUILT A STATIC PAGE WITH JEKYLL RECENTLY SURPRISED I HAVEN'T SEEN IT MENTIONED IS IT OUTDATED OR SOMETHING I'M NOT AN EXPERT BUT IT SEEMS ACTIVE AND LIKE A NICE FRAMEWORK PLUS GITHUB PAGES HAS BUILT IN SUPPORT FOR JEKYLL IF YOU HOST THERE
I'M NOT TO TALK DEEPLY ON THIS TOPIC BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT LECTOR IS A PROJECT BY ARMIN RONDACHER THE AUTHOR OF FLASK JINJA WEKZEUG TWIG AND MORE AND HE'S A PRETTY RESPECTABLE PROGRAMMER IMO

AND SO WHAT I'VE SEEN OF LECTOR IS PRETTY COOL BUT I DON'T HAVE EVEN A SINGLE STATIC SITE IN PRODUCTION SO TAKE MY THOUGHTS WITH THAT GRAIN OF SALT LOOKING FORWARD TO USING IT THOUGH WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES
STARIK MAKES IT EASY TO BUILD CONTENT FROM SAML JASON MODELS WHICH ARE TRANSFORMED INTO SQLALCHEMY AND ARE THUS QUARRIABLE
I USE PELICAN AND I REALLY LIKE IT
HYDE
ITS BASICALLY JEKYLL BUT WRITTEN IN PYTHON
HUGO S SORRY BECAME A FAN
NIKOLA DEVELOPERS BEHIND THAT CARE A LOT
ANY EXAMPLE OF SITES GENERATED WITH THESE SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN PELICAN
STARIK IS REALLY COOL IT FOCUS BEYOND STATIC BLOGS


NIKOLA
GRAV ALL THE WAY
PELICAN ALL DAY EVERY DAY
I USE THIS METHOD

CONVERTED FROM JEKYLL TO THIS IN AN HOUR OR TWO I SET UP A GIT HOOK IN MY APS WHICH BUILDS AUTOMATICALLY AND PUBLISHES ON GIT PUSH AS WELL
ONE OF THE UNSUNG BENEFITS OF A STATIC SITE IS THAT YOU CAN'T HACK THE CONTENTION SURE YOU CAN STILL ATTACK THE SITE OR HOSTING BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PATCH YOUR CMS
I BUILT ATHENA I LIKE IT AND I THINK YOU SHOULD USE IT TOO
IT'S UNFAIR THAT THE POLL IS ON TWITTER BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT



MY VOTE GOES TO NIKOLA



NIKOLA FOR THE WIN
I HAVE A RELATED QUESTION FOR THOSE OF YOU RUNNING STATIC BLOGS DO YOU JUST USE A 3RD PARTY COMMENT SYSTEM SUCH AS DISCUS
I LIKE ACHING LEARNING AND PREFER PELICAN WITH IPYNB PUGIN
YOU CAN TRY GRAPHDASH IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
DVIDSILVA GLORIA
I LIKE VISUAL STUDIO CODE IT WORKS ON WINDOWS DSX LINUX

PYCHARM IS A NICE IDE BUT IT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF LIGHTWEIGHT
SUBLIME OR VIM BUT IN BOTH YOU GONNA NEED SETUP PLUGGING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY OUT
I RECOMMEND SNYDER BECAUSE OF BUMPY AND PANDAS
WINPYTHON HAS ALL BUMPY SNIPY PANDAS JUPITER SNYDER LIGHT IDE IF RUNNING WINDOWS ARE THE BEST OPTION

SNYDER STILL WORK IN LINUX AND MAC


THIS IS A BIT OUT THERE BUT YOU COULD USE JUPITER NOTEBOOK
WHY NOT USE PYDEV BASED ON VERY LIGHT BUT MUCH BETTER THAN PYCHARM
FROM THE LOOKS OF THE ANSWERS HERE THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF SUGGESTIONS THAT AREN'T IDES BUT ARE TEXT EDITORS

VIM IS GREAT BUT IT'S JUST A COMMAND LINE TEXT EDITOR

SUBLIME TEXT ATOM ARE FANCY TEXT EDITORS BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE

PYCHARM SNYDER VISUAL STUDIO CORE ARE IDES BUT AS MANY PEOPLE MENTIONED THEY USE MORE RESOURCES BECAUSE THAT'S NEEDED TO BE AN IDE INSTEAD OF JUST A TEXT EDITOR


HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT RODEO ITS PRETTY LIGHTWEIGHT AND RUNS ON WINDOWS DSX LINUX ITS ALSO GOTTEN A LOT STABLER RECENTLY
I LIKE PYCHARM ESPECIALLY WITH THE LINTER ENABLED FOR BOTH
THIS IS NOT AN EASY SOLUTION BUT CONSIDER IT

IF NOT ALREADY PUT ARCH LINUX ON YOUR SYSTEM THEY HAVE AN AMAZING USER COMMUNITY AND WIKI SUPPORT ARCH IS FAST AND LIGHTWEIGHT COMPARED TO BLOATED SYSTEMS LIKE WINDOWS OR RESOURCE INTENSIVE ONES LIKE MACBS

SECOND LET THE UNIX ENVIRONMENT BE YOUR IDE IT CAN DO ALL THE THINGS OTHER IDES CAN AND IT'S VERY EFFICIENT AND POWERFUL

FOR AN EDITOR TRY VIM THERE ARE LOTS OF PLUGGING AVAILABLE FOR PYTHON INCLUDING AUTOCOMPLETE AND SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING AND CLINTING IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN THE SHELL VIM WILL BE NATURAL BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY THERE

LAST IF YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT GRAPHICS YOUR SYSTEM RESOURCE UTILIZATION WILL BE GREATLY REDUCED BY NOT STARTING DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT
IF YOU'RE STUCK WITH SHARED HOSTING PHS IS THE WAY TO GO IMHO WHY

WELL THE REASON IS WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY SAID PYTHON SCRIPTS OR ANY OTHER EXECUTABLE TAKES TIME LOAD UP AND START WITH CGI THE SERVER HAS TO LOAD YOUR PYTHON SCRIPT PLUS THE INTERPRETER FOR EVERY REQUEST

PYTHON IS USUALLY DEPLOYED UWSGI WHICH SOLVES THIS PROBLEM BY ONLY LOADING YOUR PYTHON SCRIPT MODULE ONCE AND SERVING ALL REQUESTS FROM THE SAME INSTANCE

PHS IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR SHARED HOSTING BECAUSE APACHE HAS A MODULE FOR PHS WITH IS ALMOST SIMILAR TO UWSGI ALMOST ALL SHARED HOSTING PROVIDERS HAVE IT SETUP LOAD ONCE AND THEN USE THE SAME RESOURCES TO SERVE EVERY REQUEST
YOUR SITE DOESN'T ALREADY USE A BACK END SCRIPTING LANGUAGE
REGARDLESS WHAT LANGUAGE DON'T USE CGI WHEN PERFORMANCE IS A CONCERN USE A DEDICATED PROCESS SPAWNED WITH SOMETHING LIKE FASTCGI OR UWSGI THAT CAN KEEP YOUR CODE IN MEMORY
R WEBDEV
HUH
NO I TYPE Q UP ARROW UP ARROW
NAH I GENERALLY ALT TAB UP ENTER
I USE IDLE SO I JUST SAVE MY CODE AND IT RUNS I LOVE
NICE PROJECT EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE WHAT IS DOING FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW
I'VE KEPT A RECORD OF EVERY MOVIE I'VE SEEN WHEN AND WHERE SINCE JANUARY 1ST OF YOU CAN FIND THAT LIST IN SAML FORMAT HERE

I'VE BEEN WAITING TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT FOR A WHILE MY HIGH HACKATHON GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOTH DO THAT AND FINALLY LEARN FLASK BECAUSE NOTHING LIKE A TWELVE-HOUR RUSH TO TRY AND WIN CASH IN ORDER TO LEARN THINGS RIGHT

DIDN'T WIN THE HACKATHON BUT I LIKE TO THINK IT WAS A NICE LEARNING EXPERIENCE I APOLOGIZE FOR THE ROUGH SHAPE IT'S IN COMMENTING WAS DAYS AFTER TO SAVE TIME DURING THE EVENT AS WELL IT'S FAR FROM FEATURE COMPLETE SINCE I HAD TO PRIORITIZE MAIN FEATURES FOR JUDGING

THE HASHING SYSTEM WAS A CLEVER WAY ON MY PART TO DODGE AROUND LEARNING AUTH 2 ON THE FLY SINCE MAKING MY OWN USER REGISTRATION SYSTEM TAKEN UP TOO MUCH TIME PROBABLY GET REPLACED BY AN ACTUAL USER SYSTEM FOR RELEASE

I HOPE YOU GUYS FIND IT INTERESTING I'M EXCITED TO FINALLY PUSH A REAL PROJECT INSTEAD OF JUST A WRAPPER FOR AN API EVEN IF THAT API IS FOR A PRETTY GREAT COMIC PLEASE GIVE ME FEEDBACK I LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THINGS
THIS CODE DOESN'T DISPLAY ANYTHING NOR AS FAR AS I CAN TELL HAVE YOU SAID WHAT'S DISPLAYED YOU'LL PROBABLY BE GIVEN A LINK TO R LEARNPYTHON BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'LL HELP UNLESS YOU'VE MISSED COPYING SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT I SUSPECT YOUR ASSUMPTION THIS CODE DISPLAYS IT IS WRONG AND YOUR QUESTION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS SNIPPET OF PYTHON WHAT ARE YOU ASKING
ONE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT FREE JUPITER NOTEBOOKS ARE HOSTED IN LINUX ON AZURE PROBABLY BECAUSE JUPYTERHUB DOES NOT RUN ON WINDOWS THIS IS A PAIN POINT FOR ME
IS THERE NO PANDAS INTEGRATION SEEMS A BIT WEAK WITHOUT
I WOULD CONSIDER BAYSIDE OR PAYT BOTH ARE PYTHON IMPLEMENTATIONS OF QT QT HAS GOT QT DESIGNER WHICH IS A WYSIWYG USER INTERFACE IN WHICH YOU CAN CLICK AND DRAW YOUR GUI GOOD LUCK
I WROTE A BLOG POST ABOUT THE OPTIONS IT'S A COUPLE OF YEARS OLD BUT THE LANDSCAPE HASN'T CHANGED MUCH
TINTER ITS BUNDLED WITH PYTHON ALREADY SO YOU AVOID THE MESS YOU WILL HAVE TRYING TO BETT PYINSTALLER TO ACCEPT ANY DEPENDENCY ON QT IT LOOKS A LITTLE DATED BUT NOT MUCH AND ALSO NO STUPID GUI DESIGNER ONLY PURE CODE
YOU COULD HEAD OVER TO CODETRIAGE THEY LIST A LOT OF OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN
MAYBE WE CAN START SOMETHING TOGETHER

I DO A SIMPLE DICTIONARY DICTIC BBUCCIANTI CLI DICTIONARY RECENTLY

DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA FOR A NEW PROJECT

WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU ACTUALLY ARE GOING TO USE
HONESTLY I'D RECOMMEND EITHER GOING THROUGH THE TRENDING PAGE ON GITHUB FOR A SPECIFIC LANGUAGE AND SEE HOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU CAN DO FOR A PROJECT THAT INTERESTS YOU OR START MAKING YOUR OWN PROJECTS
SHOULD BE


PLEASE POST YOUR CODE
PYTHON IS
IS IT BETTER THAN OWN TAKEOUT
IS THIS BETTER THAN SAY USING IMAP TO BACKUP AND OR TRANSFER BETWEEN ACCOUNTS

I USE EMAIL APPS ON MY OWN DOMAIN GRANDFATHERED INTO BEING FREE AND THAT IS HOW I TRANSFERRED MY EMAILS IT WORKED PRETTY WELL THOUGH KIND OF SLOW
WHAT'S UP WITH THESE DLL FILES IN ETC LIBS WIN AND HOW DO THEY WORK WITH YOUR REPO BEING GNU AGAL LICENSED
JUST USED THIS LAST WEEK GREAT APP
IS THERE SOMETHING SIMILAR FOR CONTACTS
GREAT PIECE OF SOFTWARE I STRUGGLED FOR COUPLE OF HOURS TRYING TO RESTORE IMAPSYNCED DATA BACK TO EMAIL WITH THIS TOOL IT WAS A MATTER OF MINUTES
I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT DEATHTIME OBJECTS SO YOUR ARTICLE WAS ENLIGHTENING

IT RAISES A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO DEATHTIME OBJECT WHY DEATHTIME ISN'T IT TIME ZONE AWARE BY DEFAULT AND WHY WHEN USING A TIMEZONE MAKES THINGS EVEN MORE COMPLEX

LOCAL TIMEZONE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON A SERVER ETC LOCALTIME SO WHY PYTHON ISN'T IT USING IT
I REALLY LIKED THIS A LOT THIS LIBRARY IS FREQUENTLY CRITICIZED AS BEING CONFUSING AND UNFRIENDLY BUT YOUR GUIDE MAKES IT QUITE CLEAR

THERE ARE A LOT OF ALTERNATIVE LIBRARIES THAT GET DISCUSSED IN THESE PARTS SUCH AS ARROW THAT ATTEMPT TO MAKE WORKING WITH DATETIMES MORE INTUITIVE PERHAPS LOOKING INTO THOSE PAST DISCUSSIONS CAN HELP TO ILLUMINATE WHAT IT IS THAT PEOPLE FIND SO CONFUSING

THAT SAID I THINK YOU REALLY KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION

WHEN DEALING WITH DEATHTIME OBJECTS I'VE COME ACROSS TWO PIECES OF ADVICE WITH WHICH I GENERALLY AGREE FIRST ALWAYS USE AWARE DEATHTIME OBJECTS AND SECOND ALWAYS WORK IN UTC AND DO TIMEZONE CONVERSION AS A LAST STEP

OFFHAND IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE HAVING TOO MANY PROBLEMS WORKING WITH DATETIMES AS LONG AS YOU ADHERE TO THAT ADVICE

EVERYONE IS HAPPY IF THEY GET EVEN A GLIMPSE OF SENSE ABOUT WHAT THE HELL THE DEATHTIME MODULE IS ABOUT
GOOD ARTICLE A COUPLE OF POINTS

YOU MENTION OFFSETS A FEW TIMES AN OFFSET IS NOT THE SAME AS A TIME ZONE A TIME ZONE MAPS TO A PARTICULAR OFFSET AT A PARTICULAR TIME BUT THAT MAPPING CAN AND DOES CHANGE THAT IS TIMEZONES CAN ALTERNATE BETWEEN DAY LIGHT SAVINGS AND NOT BUT GOVERNMENTS CAN ALSO CHANGE WHEN THEY TRANSITION IS CANCEL IT OR MAKE THE OFFSET INSTEAD OF HOUR

SOME APPS LIKE TO WORK WITH OFFSETS RATHER THAN TIME ZONES DON'T DO THIS

YOU DON'T MENTION STORING DATETIMES USUALLY YOU SHOULD STORE UTC AND CONVERT ON DISPLAY BUT FOR THINGS LIKE APPOINTMENTS YOU WANT TO STORE IN THE USERS TIMEZONE BECAUSE AS MENTIONED ABOVE OFFSETS MAPPED TO A TIMEZONE CAN CHANGE

IF I SET AN APPOINTMENT FOR AND YOU STORE THAT IN UTC THE GOVERNMENT CHANGES THE OFFSET FROM TO FOR THAT DATE NOW I'M AN HOUR LATE

TIME ZONES ARE TRICKY
A DEATHTIME OBJECT IS AN INSTANCE OF THE CLASS THAT REPRESENTS A SINGLE POINT IN TIME

AS YOU EXPLAIN IN THE REST OF THE ARTICLE BY DEFAULT DATETIMES ARE NAIVE WHICH PRECISELY MEANS THAT THEY DON'T CARRY ENOUGH INFORMATION TO REPRESENT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME
GREAT ARTICLE BUT TWO POINTS I WANT TO BRING UP

YOU SAID YOU DO EITHER


IMPORT DEATHTIME

OR

FROM DEATHTIME IMPORT DEATHTIME
I WOULD ACTUALLY
FROM DEATHTIME IMPORT DEATHTIME AS DT
YOU TIME WHEN YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE MODULE

ANYWAY THESE TWO ARE NOT THE SAME ACTUALLY THE FROM DEATHTIME IMPORT DEATHTIME LINE IS ACTUALLY MAKING A REFERENCE TO THE CLASS WHILE IMPORT DEATHTIME IS A REFERENCE TO THE MODULE THIS HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE SOME ATTRIBUTEERRORS WITH METHOD DESCRIPTORS AND MODULE OBJECTS

SECOND I REALLY LIKE THE DEATHTIME OBJECTS BUT IT'S CAUSED TOO MANY ISSUES ON THE SIMPLEST OF THINGS HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A SIMPLE PROBLEM I HAD WITH THE DEATHTIME MODULE I'M HOPING THEY MAKE IT BETTER IN THE FUTURE BUT I'M NOT SURE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO

DEF THIRDPROBLEM
FROM DEATHTIME IMPORT DEATHTIME TIMEDELTA TIME DATE
TIMEINPUT INPUT WHAT TIME ARE YOU LEAVING YOUR HOUSE TO RUN

TIMELEFTHOUSE HOUR NEWTIME MINUTE NEWTIME


EDIT LOTS OF FORMATTING

IF IT'S NOT NORMALIZED IT'LL EFFECTIVELY BRIGHTEN OR DARKEN THE IMAGE AS WELL
BTW IT MIGHT SAVE YOU TYPING
IT WORKS PERFECTLY FINE FOR ME 2 AND VS UPDATE YOU SHOULD SUBMIT AN ISSUES ON THEIR GITHUB PAGE IF YOU THINK THIS IS A BUG

GOOD LUCK
I'VE BEEN USING PYTHON X WITH VISUAL STUDIO FOR ABOUT AS LONG AS BOTH HAVE BEEN OUT THERE SHOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE WITH COMPATIBILITY WHAT IS MORE LIKELY IS THAT YOU HAVE ANOTHER VERSION OF PYTHON EG PYTHON 2 INSTALLED AND IT IS CAUSING THESE ISSUES IF YOU COULD POST AN EXAMPLE OF CODE THAT DOES DOES NOT WORK THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED ALSO TRY RUNNING PY 2 AND PY
I THINK THE GENERATE SEQUENCES ONE IS MISSING A FROM BUT OTHER THAN THAT I ADMIT I'VE BEEN A ER FOREVER AND THIS DOPE GENERATOR CHEAT SHEET HAS OPENED MY EYES
IF YOU DECIDE TO CALL A VARIABLE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO NOT USE IT

QUESTIONS
MAYBE ADD UNPACKING OF GENERATORS IN LIST LITERALS AND TUPLE ASSIGNMENTS AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE

N FOR N IN RANGE
N 2 FOR N IN RANGE

2

G N FOR N IN RANGE
A B C
PRINT A B C
2
VERY NICE REFERENCE THANK YOU

MAYBE YOU CAN ADD LINKS TO RELEVANT DOCS

ALSO YOU HAVE A TYPO EXPLANATION NOT EXPIATION
EXCELLENT PROJECT THANKS FOR SHARING I WAS THINKING IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE CLIFF NOTES OR A CHEAT SHEET FOR THE WHOLE OF PYTHON I'VE BEEN MEANING TO GET INTO ASYNC IO FOR AWHILE
IT ANNOYS THE FUCK OUT OF ME WHEN PEOPLE WRITE THEIR CODE LIKE THIS

IF N
PASS

YOU MUST PUT SPACES

IF N
PASS

IT'S EVEN MORE INFURIATING WHEN THEY'RE NOT CONSISTENT AND DO A MIX OF BOTH IN THEIR CODE


THIS IS GREAT
SO THIS USES THREADS WTF

THE FACTORIAL FUNCTION CAN BE COMPUTED VIA TAIL RECURSION OPTIMIZATION ITS INHERENTLY NO PARALLELISABLE
BUT WHY WHY ALL OF THIS

FIRSTLY WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS

FACTORIAL
FOR I IN RANGE NUMBER
FACTORIAL I

SECONDLY WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS IN A THREAD YOU DON'T TOTALLY FREE UP THE REST OF THE PROGRAM TO KEEP RUNNING YOU'RE JUST FIGHTING WITH IT FOR CPU TIME

ALSO THE CODE ON YOUR BLOG ISN'T EVEN FORMATTED AS PYTHON
R DAILYPROGRAMMER AND R ROGUELIKEDEV MAKE STUFF YOU CARE ABOUT OR NEED OR WANT AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT FOLLOWING A PATHOLOGY I REALIZE THAT IS REALLY PITHY AND UNHELPFUL BUT IT'S THE BEST METHOD

FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I STARTED TO LEARN PYTHON I DECIDED TO TRY MY HAND AT MAKING A CHESS PROGRAM SO I KILLED MYSELF OVER A REALLY SHITTY CHESS PROGRAM FOR A COUPLE MONTHS AND THEN I DECIDED TO TRY MY HAND AT IMPLEMENTING CHESS 2 A VARIANT BY DAVID SILIN SO I FOUND SOMEONE OPEN SOURCE CHESS PROGRAM AND HACKED AT IT UNTIL I GOT SOMETHING CLOSE TO WORKABLE THEN I WENT BACK AND TRIED AGAIN WITH SUNFISH

AT EACH STAGE I LEARNED SOMETHING DRASTIC ABOUT MY OWN ABILITIES AND ABOUT HOW PYTHON WORKED UNDER THE HOOD ALL DRIVEN BY A STUPID FEELING OF THIS SHOULD BE EASY WHY IS THIS SO HARD AND THE DOGGED DETERMINATION TO HAVE A FINISHED PRODUCT

PLAY AROUND UNTIL YOU FIND THE SAME AND YOU'LL LEARN PYTHON SOON ENOUGH

ALSO DON'T LEARN PYTHON 2 LOOK TO THE FUTURE
IF YOU ARE ON A DESKTOP PLEASE READ THE SIDEBAR
THANKS NOAHTHEDUKE FOR THE POINTERS MUCH APPRECIATED ANNNNNNNNND THANKS TO EDIMAUDO FOR POINTING OUT MY LACK OF OBSERVATION HAHA

I DON'T VISIT REDDIN OFTEN AND AM VERY ACCUSTOMED TO ASSUMING ALL CONTENT IN THE SIDEBAR OF WEBPAGES IS PURELY SHITTY ADS AND DIDN'T BOTHER TO PAY THE SIDE BAR ANY ATTENTION

I THINK I HAVE ALL I NEED THANKS AGAIN
PLEASE ADD TO THE SIDEBAR

BTW GREAT PLACE TO FIND EXERCISES
I'M GOING THROUGH THE THINKPYTHON BOOK RIGHT NOW ALONG WITH PROJECT EULER HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH AFTERWARDS I MIGHT DO SOME OPENCUT STUFF WITH IT
PEGLET IS NOT DEAD IT'S DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY IS SMALL AND RIGHT NOW THEY ARE MOSTLY BUG FIXING IT'S STILL A GREAT PLATFORM THOUGH I DO RECOMMEND USING COCOS 2D WITH IT
CIVY AND SPECIFICALLY INVENT FOR GAMES

ALSO PEGLET IS NOT DEAD IN MY OPINION WORK IS STILL BEING DONE IN THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH AS FAR AS I KNOW

COCOS 2D IS ALRIGHT AND YOU CAN ALWAYS DROP DOWN TO THE PEGLET LEVEL IN IT IF YOU NEED FINER CONTROL OF THE RENDERING

FINALLY I HOPE THAT THERE WILL EVENTUALLY BE A VOLKAN EQUIVALENT TO PEGLET
WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT PANDA 3D
JUST USE PYSDL 2 HONESTLY THE ACTUAL GRAPHICS PART OF A GAME IS USUALLY OF THE CODE ANYWAY AND SHOULD BE ABSTRACTED AWAY SO YOUR LOGIC ISN'T DEPENDANT ON ONE PARTICULAR RENDERER ONCE YOU HAVE THAT UP AND RUNNING YOU SOON FIND YOUR OTHER OF YOUR GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DRAWING
PEGLET CONTRIBUTOR HERE IT'S DEFINITELY NOT DEAD AND IS CURRENTLY SEEING BUGFIXES AND CLEANUPS AFTER A MERGE TO A DUAL PYTHON COMPATIBLE CODEBASE THE AUDIO BACKENDS PULSE DIRECTSOUND PENAL ARE UNDERGOING A MAJOR REWRITE I'M PERSONALLY WORKING ON AN SDL 2 STYLE GAMECONTROLLER API FOR PEGLET PLEASE GET IN TOUCH IF YOU WANT TO HELP TESTING

LONG WINDED RANT INCOMING
AFTER USING PREGAME PYSDL 2 FOR SEVERAL YEARS I FINALLY GAVE PEGLET A TRY I WISH I DID SOONER BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE BEST OF THE BUNCH THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY I THINK PEGLET IS AWESOME AND WHY I'M INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE IT HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE

PEGLET IS PURE PYTHON WITH NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES ALBIN IS OPTIONAL STANDARD PYTHON LIBRARY ONLY NO EXTRA INSTALLS OR MODULES NECESSARY IT DOES MAKE HEAVY USE OF COTYPES FOR OPENGL ETC BINDINGS AND INTERNAL LOW LEVEL DATA STRUCTURES BUT THE CODEBASE IS PERFECTLY READABLE AND FIXABLE BY PYTHON DEVELOPERS THIS MEANS YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PEGLET AND MAKE IT GREAT EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH COTYPES THE CODEBASE IS VERY READABLE AND I THINK WELL ORGANIZED
2 PEGLET IS VERY PYTHONIC UNLIKE LIBRARIES SUCH AS PYSDL 2 YOU DON'T NEED TO WRITE CODE OR LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE TO WRITE A GAME IN PEGLET IN PARTICULAR USING THE RENDERING INPUT AND AUDIO CODE IN PYSDL 2 AND EVEN PREGAME FEELS REALLY FUNKY AS IT'S A DIFFERENT STYLE
PEGLET HAS A LOT OF EASY TO USE CLASSES FOR AUDIO SPRITES TEXT AND INPUT HOWEVER THE FULL POWER OF OPENGL IS RIGHT THERE IF YOU WANT TO USE IT YOU DON'T NEED TO SET UP ANY SPECIAL CONTEXTS OR USE AN ADDITIONAL OPENGL LIBRARY YOU JUST USE IT IF YOU WANT TO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO FULL OPENGL BUT STILL WANT SOMETHING LOWER LEVEL THAN THE HIGH LEVEL SPRITE IMAGE CLASSES THERE IS A AWESOME GRAPHICS MODULE THAT HAS SUPPORT FOR DRAWING LOTS OF DIFFERENT PRIMITIVES EFFICIENTLY
GODOT ENGINE IS A FREE UNITY LIKE GAME ENGINE THAT USES A PYTHON DIALECT AS IT'S MAIN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

IT'S THE MOST ADVANCED GAME ENGINE FOR PYTHON
HAS ANYBODY HEARD OF THE PYTHON ARCADE LIBRARY SEEMS TO BE SMALL BUT PROMISING


CIVY WITH INVENT IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS RIGHT NOW AND IT'S NOT GREAT

PEGLET ISN'T DEAD IT'S JUST IN MAINTENANCE MODE IT'S REALLY A TOOL FOR MAKING GAME FRAMEWORKS AND NOT A GAME FRAMEWORK ITSELF LIKE COCOS 2D

PREGAME ISN'T ONLY NOT PYTHONIC IT'S ALSO COMPLETELY DEAD THE WEBSITE IS UNMAINTAINED VISITING THE DOCUMENTATION PAGES IS AS LIKELY TO DELIVER AN ATTEMPTED EXPLOIT OF A BROWSER VULNERABILITY THAN THE INFO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

I'VE GIVEN UP ON PYTHON FOR GAME DEVELOPMENT THE PYTHON COMMUNITY SEEMS TO HAVE LARGELY ABANDONED THE IDEA WITH A FEW STRUGGLING EXCEPTIONS
I THINK THERE'S ROOM HERE FOR A NEW LIBRARY IF I HAD MY PICK AT A COMPLETELY NEW PROJECT

USE CFF SO PIPY IS A VIABLE OPTION
USE GLEW AND OPENGL FOR GRAPHICS
USE BULLET FOR PHYSICS
USE ENET FOR NETWORKING
SOUND SDL I'D REALLY RATHER AVOID ANY SDL 2 AT THIS POINT

JUST CONNECTING THOSE PIECES ALONE IS DIFFICULT TO DO WELL BUT THEN BUILDING A GREAT PYTHONIC LIBRARY ON TOP WOULD BE FANTASTIC
DAMN I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WITH A DECENT DOCUMENTATION AND ACTUAL REAL EXAMPLES PEGLET COULD BE A GOOD LIBRARY
THERE IS PYSFML PYTHON BINDINGS TO SAML IT'S PRETTY PYTHONIC AND SHOULD BE FAST SINCE IT WRITTEN IN COTHON BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT SEEMS ABANDONED
PYSDL MAYBE
PREGAME IS ACTIVE ON BITBUCKET THE WEBSITE IS OUTDATED THO
DON'T MAKE GAMES IN PYTHON IT'S THE WRONG TOOL FOR THE JOB


C

GAME DEV ON PYTHON HAS ALWAYS AND LIKELY WILL ALWAYS BE TERRIBLE
IF YOU START A BIG NEW PROJECT AT THIS TIME YOU SHOULD EITHER JUST USE PYTHON OR WRITE CODE THAT WORKS IN BOTH VERSIONS AND RUN TESTS ON BOTH

NEITHER SOLUTION IS TERRIBLY HARD

BUMPY IS AVAILABLE FOR BOTH PYTHON 2 AND
PYTHON FOR EVERYTHING THE MORE YOU USE IT THE MORE LIBRARIES GET PORTED
UNLESS THERE IS A VERY SPECIFIC AND COMPELLING REASON TO USE PYTHON 2 USE PYTHON THERE WERE SOME PAINFUL UPDATES IN THE EARLIER VERSIONS OF BUT MORE RECENT UPDATES HAVE HAD FAR FEWER BREAKING CHANGES WHILE ADDING LOTS OF POWERFUL NEW CAPABILITIES YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IN THE FUTURE
SO I'LL BE STARTING A YEAR LONG PROJECT NEXT SEMESTER USING PYTHON WHILE DISCUSSING PYTHON WITH MY SUPERVISOR HE EXPRESSED CONCERNS REGARDING HOW FAST PYTHON IS GROWING AND THUS WANTED TO MAKE SURE I KNEW HOW TO GET AROUND MY CODE BREAKING SIMPLY BECAUSE I UPDATE PYTHON

THAT IS VERY MUCH BULLSHIT PYTHON IS MATURE WITH BUSINESSES RELYING ON IT IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR BREAKING CHANGES TO BE INTRODUCED OVERNIGHT WITHOUT A REALLY GOOD MIGRATION PLAN TO GO WITH IT PYTHON INTRODUCED A TRUCKLOAD OF BREAKING CHANGES BY DESIGN WHICH IS WHY PYTHON 2 IS STILL A THING YEARS LATER HOWEVER CODE WRITTEN FOR PYTHON WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY STILL WORK ON AND ANY FUTURE X VERSIONS AND CODE WRITTEN AGAINST IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY TO BREAK ON AND ONWARD IN SHORT THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE I WOULD HOWEVER STRONGLY RECOMMEND PYTHON FOR NEW PROJECTS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST USE SOME LIBRARY THAT ABSOLUTELY CAN'T BE MADE TO WORK WITH PYTHON

LIBRARIES ARE A SLIGHTLY BIGGER CONCERNS BUT THE TOOLING AROUND LIBRARY ECOSYSTEM MOST NOTABLY PEPI AND PIP IS GOOD ENOUGH TO HANDLE THIS FLAWLESSLY

THAT SAID I HIGHLY RECOMMEND VIRTUALENV A VERY SIMPLE TOOL TO SANDBOX YOUR PYTHON PROJECTS SUCH THAT YOU CAN INSTALL PYTHON INTERPRETERS AND LIBRARIES ON A BASIS QUICK RUNDOWN

IN YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY CREATE A VIRTUALENV VIRTUALENV ENV
ACTIVATE THE VIRTUALENV SOURCE ENV BIN ACTIVATE UNTIL YOU CALL DEACTIVATE THE PYTHON AND PIP BINARIES WILL NOW DO ALL THEIR WORK INSIDE THE VIRTUALENV
USE PIP INSTALL TO INSTALL LIBRARIES
ONCE YOU HAVE ALL THE DEPENDENCIES YOU NEED DO PIP FREEZE THIS DUMPS A LIST OF CURRENTLY INSTALLED LIBRARIES INTO A FILE WHICH YOU CAN LATER USE TO INSTALL THE EXACT SAME VERSIONS AGAIN THE COMMAND TO DO THAT IS PIP INSTALL R
IN CASE ANYTHING GOES WRONG AND YOU WANT TO START FROM SCRATCH JUST NUKE THE ENV DIRECTORY AND CREATE A NEW VIRTUALENV
WHEN USING SOURCE CONTROL GIT OR WHATEVER YOU PREFER DO NOT CHECK IN THE ENV DIRECTORY DO CHECK IN THE THOUGH

FINALLY IF THE PYTHON 2 VS THING BOTHERS YOU LOOK INTO WHICH SHOULD SHIP WITH YOUR PYTHON DISTRIBUTION AND THE SIX LIBRARY IS A UTILITY THAT ATTEMPTS TO AUTOMATICALLY CONVERT PYTHON 2 SOURCE FILES TO PYTHON AND IT DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB THE SIX LIBRARY CONTAINS A BUNCH OF UTILITY STUFF THAT IRONS OUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PYTHON 2 AND FOR EXAMPLE IT CONTAINS AN ALIAS FOR THE UNICODE STRING TYPE IN BOTH POINTING IT TO UNICODE IN PYTHON 2 STR IN PYTHON
PYTHON PYTHON 2 IS A DEAD END IT IS ALREADY IN MAINTENANCE MODE AND SOON WILL STOP BEING SUPPORTED PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON IS MORE ENJOYABLE TO USE

ALSO WITH PYTHON 2 VS DIFFERENCES THOSE AREN'T BIG ENOUGH DIFFERENCES THAT YOU COULDN'T PICK UP IN FEW MINUTES
EVERYONE IN THIS THREAD WHO TELLS YOU TO DEFINITELY GO WITH PYTHON IS PUSHING THEIR OWN AGENDA INSTEAD OF LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR INTERESTS EITHER VERSION WILL WORK FOR WHAT YOU WANT AND PYTHON WILL NOT DISAPPEAR AS THEY HOPE IN MY OPINION PYTHON JUST KEEPS ADDING SILLINESS TO THE LANGUAGE BUT MAYBE THOSE ARE FEATURES YOU CARE ABOUT
WHILE DISCUSSING PYTHON WITH MY SUPERVISOR HE EXPRESSED CONCERNS REGARDING HOW FAST PYTHON IS GROWING AND THUS WANTED TO MAKE SURE I KNEW HOW TO GET AROUND MY CODE BREAKING SIMPLY BECAUSE I UPDATE PYTHON

SOLUTION UPDATE PYTHON

I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS IF YOU'RE DOING SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT THEN YOU PICK A MINIMUM VERSION OF PYTHON YOU'RE DEVELOPING TO AND THEN MAKE A VIRTUALENV THAT INCLUDES THAT EXACT VERSION OF PYTHON AND ANY OTHER LIBRARIES YOU NEED

THEN YOU NEVER EVER CHANGE THAT VIRTUALENV WHEN YOU WANT TO USE A DIFFERENT VERSION OF LIBRARIES YOU CREATE A NEW VIRTUALENV AND TEST YOUR PROGRAM WITH THAT
I WILL REITERATE THAT PYTHON OR BOTH PROBABLY IS THE CHOICE IN PYTHON 2 WILL LIKELY BE UNSUPPORTED BY THE PSF THOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE SOMEONE WILL MAKE A FORK AND MAINTAIN IT THAT IS A LONG SHOT THIS MEANS NO SECURITY OR STABILITY FIXES AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO PORT YOUR LIBRARY THEN INSTEAD OF SAVING WORK BY CHOOSING PYTHON NOW

IF YOU WANT TO USE PYTHON 2 I SUGGEST WRITING USING A SUBSET THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH BOTH PYTHON AND PYTHON IT IS PRETTY TRIVIAL NOWADAYS
JUST GO WITH PYTHON STICK WITH THE CURRENT OR WAIT FOR BECAME THE COAMING COULD BE INTERESTING

MOST OF THE IMPORTANT AND HIGHLY USED LIBRARIES ARE PORTED TO AND SOME NEW ONES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR

PERSONALLY I ONLY NEED JUST FOR ONE LIB AND THAT IS VERY SPECIAL AND ISN'T FIDLEY USED SO PORTING IS JUST A TIME WASTER IT RAN AS A SINGLE CRONJOB TO GATHER SOME DATA AND PUSH IT INTO A DATABASE SO NO BIG DEAL TO USE FOR THIS ONE THING

BUMPY PANDAS SYMPL AND NETWORK ARE ALREADY PORTED SO EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR NUMBER CRUNCHING
THE ONLY TWO MAJOR ISSUES I'VE RUN INTO WITH 2 IS PRINT STATEMENTS VERSUS FUNCTIONS AND STRINGS VERSUS BYTES
SOME READE WITH AN EXPLANATION WHAT DIASHAPES IS WOULD BE A START
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY IT BEING THE CRAZY DAYS OF THE FIRST OR MAYBE SECOND OR THIRD DOTCOM BOOM BUST THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE NAME OF THE COMPANY HENCE LEGITIMATELY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER REGARDLESS OF DOMAIN NAME STATUS LICENSING TENDS TO REQUIRE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO REPRODUCE THAT INFORMATION IT'S NOT NECESSARILY IMPORTANT OR POSSIBLE TO CHECK IT AS YOU GO
BEING THE CURRENT REGISTRANT OF A DOMAIN DOES NOT SOMEHOW GIVE YOU ANY RIGHTS TO OF ANY OF THE ASSETS OF A PAST REGISTRANT OF THE SAME DOMAIN THAT WOULD BE ABSURD IF YOU WANTED TO ASSERT THOSE RIGHTS YOU'D HAVE TO SHOW DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU ACQUIRED THEM FROM THE COMPANY BEFORE IT FOLDED AND THOSE KIND OF TRANSACTIONS ARE BACKED BY SIGNED LEGAL CONTRACTS YOU CAN'T JUST STROLL IN AND SAY HEY I HAPPEN TO HAVE REGISTERED THIS DOMAIN NAME GIVE ME ALL YOUR STUFF

DOWNLOADING IT NOW THIS IS THE FIRST I'VE HEARD OF IT

IT'S PROBABLY A BIT OCD BUT FOR MOST OF MY CODE I RUN IT THROUGH MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF PYTHON IN VIRTUALENVS FOR TESTING PIPY EVEN THOUGH I DEPLOY INTERNALLY TO A SINGLE VERSION MOST OF THE TIME IF NOTHING ELSE I HAVE ANOTHER INTERPRETER IN MY TESTING ARSENAL NOW

THE INTEL DISTRIBUTION OF PYTHON IS JUST ANACONDA WITH THE ACCELERATE PACKAGE FROM ANACONDA INCLUDED WITH IT THAT INCLUDES THE DKL LIBRARY TO PARALLELIZE ALGEBRA FUNCTIONS
I MUST SAY IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT'S CERTAIN ABOUT INTEL IT'S THAT THEIR SOFTWARE IS ALWAYS AMAZINGLY FAST
YOU MEAN ANACONDA
MY WORKLOAD IS AND SO IT'S NOT THE CORE FOCUS OF THE INTEL DISTRIBUTION BUT I WAS HOPING IT WOULD OFFER SOME PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT ON REGULAR PYTHON CODE SO I THOUGHT I'D DO A LITTLE TESTAMENT I CLONED THIS REPO AND UPDATED IT FOR PYTHON AND HERE ARE THE RESULTS


PYTHON 2 INTEL CORPORATION DEFAULT OCT
GCC 2 RED HAT ON LINUX

JINJA 2
MAKO
MAKO USING DEF

AND ON MY CURRENT PYTHON

PYTHON DEFAULT OCT
GCC ON LINUX

JINJA 2
MAKO
MAKO USING DEF


NOW THERE ARE ADMITTEDLY QUITE A FEW VARIABLES HERE WHAT WITH DIFFERENT COMPILERS AND PYTHON VS ALL THAT TO SAY I WAS HOPING THAT THE INTEL DISTRIBUTION WOULD SHOW AN IMPROVEMENT ON REGULAR PYTHON CODE BUT IT DOESN'T ON THIS TEMPLATE TESTAMENT

AGAIN NOT THAT IT REALLY MATTERS I KNOW IT'S NOT THE TARGET WORKLOAD SO I DON'T WANT TO CRITICIZE THE INTEL VERSION
IS THIS COMPLETELY COMPILED WITH INTEL COMPILER TOOL CHAIN FOR C C FORTRAN IF YES HOW COMPATIBLE IS THIS WITH PIP CONDA PACKAGES COMPILED WITH MSBC
REST IN PEACE ROB
WON'T QUIT
COULD SOMEONE KINDLY ELI THIS FOR ME ALSO HOW COME THERE ISN'T AN EXAMPLE WITH SOME CODE DATA TO SHOW ME EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING
DATA SCIENCE DATA ANALYSIS FOR EXAMPLE ALSO SOME OTHER STUFF IN THAT FIELDS
DEVONS I USE PYTHON RUBY JAVA GROOVY SQL ALL THE TIME FOR AUTOMATION AND VALIDATION
SOFTWARE QA A LOT OF AUTOMATED TESTING IS BUILT IN PYTHON
AUTOMATION SOFTWARE ENGINEER
WHERE ABOUTS ARE YOU LOCATED LOOKING FOR JOBS
GO TO METUMPS PYTHON POSTURES DATA SCIENCE ETC EMAILING A RESUME TO A JOB BOARD SUCKS HAVING A BEER WITH THE HIRING MANAGER AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS AND HOBBYISTS IS MUCH BETTER

EDIT I WORK AT A COMPANY THAT MAKES SOFTWARE FOR GENETIC DIAGNOSTICS LOTS OF PYTHON GIT BASH AND VAGRANT VMS OUR PRODUCT IS A VM WITH A WEB APP SO THERE'S SOME WEB DEV BUT IT'S NOT THE MAJORITY OF THE WORK
WARNING I HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT THE MOCK LIBRARY AND MONKEYPATCHING IN TESTS IN GENERAL



CAN WE NOT MOCKING ISN'T SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DONE LIGHTLY AND MOCKING AN ORM RESPONSE IS BAD JUJU FOR MULTIPLE REASONS

YOU DON'T OWN THAT INTERFACE MIKE BAYER OR ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTORS CAN UP AND CHANGE THAT FLOW AT ANY TIME THEY PROBABLY WON'T BUT IT'S POSSIBLE NOW YOUR TESTS PASS BUT YOUR CODE IS BROKEN AND YOU'VE NO IDEA WHY

2 DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF YOUR APP YOU'D PROBABLY BENEFIT MORE FROM STUFF THE DATABASE DETAILS AND ORM DETAILS BEHIND A REPOSITORY INTERFACE WHERE YOU CAN STUFF QUERIES LIKE OR WHATEVER IF IT'S A SMALLER APP EH YOU'RE JUST GONNA MAKE A HEADACHE FOR YOURSELF YOU NEED TO GAUGE THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN

I DON'T A SEE A MENTION OF USING THE FEATURE WHICH ENSURES THAT YOU CAN ONLY CALL EXISTING METHODS AND THE VARIOUS SPECIAL MOCK METHODS ON YOUR STAND IN ASSUME YOU FAT FINGERED YOUR TEST AND YOU END UP DOING WHOOPS
IS PRETTY GOOD
PYGLPK AND PYMATHPROG ALL INTEGRATE WITH GALIK YOU CAN SORT OUT THE GRAPHS AND TABLES ON YOUR OWN FROM THE OUTPUT


NOT SURE IF IT'S THE RIGHT AREA FOR YOU BUT OPENMDAO HETP IS NEAT
PERSONAL PREFERENCE IS PYCHARM OF THE TWO ORIGINALLY PYTHON SUPPORT WAS A PLUG IN FOR INTELLIJ IN MUCH THE SAME WAY YOU CAN GET A PYTHON PUGIN IN FOR VS CODE OR ECLIPSE

OVER TIME PYCHARM EMERGED AS IT'S OWN FULL IDE WHICH ALLOWED IT TO ZOOM IN AND SERVE AS IT'S PRIMARY FOCUS WHILE STILL BEING ABLE TO USE OTHER PLUGGING FROM THE BASE INTELLIJ PYCHARM IS JUST SO FOCUSED IT'S MILES AHEAD OF OTHER OPTIONS THE FACT THAT THERE IS A PRO VERSION ALSO HELPS DRIVE CONSTANT SUPPORT FOR THE NEWEST FEATURES AND REGULAR BUG FIXES

IMO NO COMPETITION UNLESS YOU ARE REGULARLY SWITCHING BETWEEN LANGUAGES OR ARE MORE A SCRIPT WRITER VS A DEVELOPER

DK WHY SOME PEOPLE VIEW IT AS SLOW I RUN MINE IN VIRUTALBOX VMS FOR ISOLATION AND IT STILL FEELS INSTANT ONLY SLOW TIMES MIGHT BE WHEN YOU CHANGE INTERPRETER INSTALL NEW PACKAGES AND IT HAS TO REINDEX SO I GUESS IF SOME PEOPLE STILL DON'T RUN HSSDS MAY BE SLOWER
PYCHARM COMMUNITY

VS CODE IS NOT A FULL-FLEDGED IDE IT'S AN ENHANCED TEXT EDITOR LIKE NOTEPAD OR SUBLIME TEXT

THE DEBUGGING TOOLS IN PYCHARM ARE TOP-NOTCH GIT VCS INTEGRATION IS SEAMLESS AND INTUITIVE THE PLUGGING ARE HANDY AND THE CODE COMPLETION IS GREAT
MISCODE HANDS DOWN

I HAVE TWO PYTHON EXTENSIONS INSTALLED
MAGICPYTHON BETTER SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
2 PYTHON DEBUGGING CLINTING INTELLISENSE ETC

WITH THOSE INSTALLED MISCODE PROVIDES ALL THE THINGS THAT I WANT FOR PYTHON DEVELOPMENT TASKS


CMD CLICK TO GOTO DEFINITION
AUTOMATIC CLINTING ON SAVE

MOST OF THE REST OF THE FEATURES THAT PYCHARM PROVIDES BEYOND THOSE I USE VERY INFREQUENTLY SO I SEE NO POINT IN USING SUCH A HEAVY IDE FOR DEVELOPMENT I STILL LOVE JETBRAINS PRODUCTS AND USE INTELLIJ ANDROID STUDIO REGULARLY FOR ANDROID DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE IS A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN SPEED BETWEEN THE TWO
I ACTUALLY HAVE PYCHARM PROFESSIONAL AND VS CODE USING BOTH OFTEN FOR PYTHON PARTLY I LIKE TO VARY THE FEEL OF MY WORK NOW AND THEN THEY ALSO BOTH HAVE GREAT ADVANTAGES PYCHARM AUTOMATES A LOT OF MAGIC AND INTEGRATES A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOOLS VS CODE IS MUCH FASTER TO LOAD AND GIVES YOU EASY ACCESS TO STEP DEBUGGING AND COMMAND LINE SO NOTHING IS HIDDEN BY MAGIC BOTH CAN BE BETTER OR WORSE IF I HAD TO USE PYCHARM COMMUNITY I WOULD PROBABLY FORGO PYCHARM SIMPLY BECAUSE I WOULD WANT JINJA 2 TEMPLETON AND JAVASCRIPT STUFF THAT I NEED PRO FOR NOW BOTH ARE FANTASTIC THOUGH AND YOU LOSE NOTHING SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH I SIMPLY ADD MY IDE RELATED FILES AND FOLDERS TO MY GITIGNORE I'D GO A STEP FURTHER AND RECOMMEND FLIPPING BETWEEN OPERATING SYSTEMS WHILE DEVELOPING SO THAT YOU MAINTAIN YOUR CODE AS CROSS PLATFORM AND GET USED TO MAKING PROJECTS THAT ARE EASY TO SPIN UP FOR DEV IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS BUT THEN I'VE ALREADY STARTED FAR FROM YOUR QUESTION BOTH ARE FREE TRY BOTH WEB MIGHT BE LIMITED IF YOU'RE STUCK ON COMMUNITY OTHERWISE IT'S ABOUT WHETHER YOU LIKE MAGIC FEATURES DOING THINGS FOR YOU LIKE A GUI FOR PIP THOUGH PYCHARM STILL MAKES IT EASY TO USE A TERMINAL TOO
I'VE BEEN USING VS CODE QUITE A BIT LATELY AND I REALLY CAN'T COMPLAIN THE AUTO FILENAME COMPLETE IS SUPER HANDY AND I'M TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH THE SETI MODIFIED COLOR THEME FOR IT I MADE A CUSTOM THEME IN PYCHARM TO TRY AND COPY IT BUT IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE I'M ALSO QUITE FOND OF IT FOR SMALL ISH ONE-OFF TYPE PROJECTS

BUT FOR BIGGER PROJECTS I ALWAYS END UP IN PYCHARM AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER FOR SOMETHING BEING A FULL ON IDE IT HAS SOME FEATURES THAT VS CODE JUST DOESN'T HAVE YET LIKE BEING ABLE TO SET CUSTOM INTERPRETER PARAMETERS FOR RUNNING SCRIPTS OR AUTOMATICALLY ADDING DOCSTRINGS WITH THE CLICK OF A BUTTON VS CODE DOESN'T HAVE A PLUG YET TO DO THIS I HAVEN'T FOUND ONE ANYWAYS BUT MAN I WISH IT DID

LIKE THE POOR FELLOW WHO FORGOT HIS PASSWORD SAID IN THE COMMENT ABOVE PYCHARM STARTED OUT AS JUST PYTHON SUPPORT FOR INTELLIJ SO WHO KNOWS MAYBE IN TIME VS CODE WILL BECOME A FULL BLOWN IDE AS WELL

IN THE END USE WHAT MAKES YOU COMFORTABLE AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO MIX IT UP A BIT EITHER SO TILL NEXT TIME KEEP FIT AND HAVE FUN
VS CODE IS NICE IT'S ON PAR WITH SUBLIME IF YOU KIT IT OUT RIGHT IT WILL APPROXIMATE PYCHARM BUT DEBUGGING IS INCREDIBLY USEFUL ESPECIALLY ONCE YOU START WORKING WITH A CODEBASE THAT IS HUGE I COULD DO WHAT I DO PARSING LARGE VOLUMES OF HETP DATA WITHOUT IT IF I MADE JUDICIOUS USE OF IADB AND BREAKPOINTS BUT CLICKING ON THE MARGIN OF THE EDITOR IN PYCHARM IS A CINCH

GIT INTEGRATION IS NICE TOO BUT I HONESTLY DO MOST OF MY GIT ON THE COMMAND LINE I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT EACH COMMIT IN ITS NAKED STATE
TRY BOTH AND THEN DECIDE IF YOU HAVE HEAVY-WEIGHT PYTHON PROJECT AND YOU SPEND MOST OF THE TIME ON IT THEN USE PYCHARM IF YOU HAVE MANY SMALL PROJECTS OR EVEN SCRIPTS THEN VS CODE IS DEFINITELY BETTER BECAUSE IT'S STARTUP TIME IS VASTLY BETTER
I'M THE DEV ADVOCATE AT PYCHARM IF YOU'RE INTERESTED HERE'S A VIDEO SERIES TO INTRODUCE SOME FEATURES OF PYCHARM
I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR TO COMPARE VS CODE TO PYCHARM

VS CODE IS A FAIRLY YOUNG PROJECT AND IT'S GETTING BETTER AND BETTER I USE PYCHARM COMMUNITY ON MY PYTHON DEVS BUT KEEP AN EYE ON VS CODE AND USE IT AS MY DEFAULT EDITOR
I USE BOTH DAILY BEEN USING PYCHARM AS MY MAIN IDE FOR THE LAST YEARS OR SO AND SWITCHED FROM SUBLIME TO ATOM TO ASC AS MY SECONDARY IDE MAIN TEXT EDITOR OVER THE SAME PERIOD I ALSO USE VIM FOR QUICKLY EDITING FILES FROM THE SHELL

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT ASC IS THAT IT PROVIDES A FAIR BOX EXPERIENCE HOURS OF TWEAKING TRYING PLUGGING ETC WITH JUST A COUPLE OF PLUGGING ALSO IT PLAYS WELL WITH THE MAIN TOOLS FROM THE PYTHON ECOSYSTEM PEP FLAKE PLAINT YAFF ETC

PYCHARM TAKES LONGER TO STARTUP WHICH IS A BIT ANNOYING BUT IS BETTER AT WORKING WITH LARGE CODEBASES
NONE OF THEM I DON'T LIKE JAVA BASED APPS THEY ARE TOO SLOW FOR ME
I FEEL AS IF THIS IS FINALLY A PRODUCT THAT I CAN START TO SHARE OUT THERE STILL ISN'T A BATTLE OR TRADE SYSTEM BUT YOU CAN MOVE AROUND THE MAP BUY ITEMS CAPTURE BITON THAT HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTER AND GET SOME RANDOM ITEMS BITCREDITS BY EXPLORING TOWN TYPE SECTORS AT THIS STAGE EVERYTHING WORKS THROUGH THE PYTHONDIALOG LIBRARY ON THE CLIENT SIDE SERVER SIDE IS A FLASK SERVER AFTER I MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE API CALLS WORK USING THE DIALOG BASED SYSTEM I WILL BE CREATING ANOTHER FLASK SERVER TO WORK AS A GRAPHICAL CLIENT IT'S BEING CONSTANTLY DEVELOPED BY MYSELF AND I HOPE TO HAVE A GRAPHICAL ANDROID APP BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR

EDIT IF ANYONE GOT AN ERROR WHEN TRYING TO MOVE THAT IS NOW RESOLVED I FORGOT AN ELSE
DAYS OF DEVELOPER TIME COST ABOUT IN SALARY NOT COUNTING BENEFITS VACATION DAYS OFFICE SPACE HARDWARE LEARNING MATERIALS CONFERENCES ETC

SO CHM A SMALL CHANCE AT PRIZE MONEY FOR DAYS OF RELENTLESS HACKING PROBABLY WITH MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF OVERTIME DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A FAIR DEAL TO ME
I SEE THE POST BUT DOES ANYBODY USE REACTOR AS A DAILY DRIVER MY FIRST THOUGHT IS FOR MY TOSHIBA LAPTOP

DOES ANYBODY DEVELOP ON THIS ON THIS SUB
WHAT A FRUSTRATING WEBSITE IT HAS ALL THE FRILLS AND FOOFARAWS BUT WHERE IS THE INFO WHERE FOR EXAMPLE DOES IT SAY PYTHON 2 AND SUPPORTED AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DO THE WINDOWS INSTALLERS WORK ON IT OR NOT

AND I SPENT TEN MINUTES TRYING TO FIND A SIMPLE LIST OF WHAT WINAPPS ARE KNOWN TO WORK ON IT AND WHICH NOT NOTHING BUT THE EXTREMELY SLENDER FAQ

WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO CHECK IF YOUR FAVOURITE APPS RUN BY TRYING THEM AND REPORTING EITHER YOUR SUCCESS WITH THE COMMUNITY OR ANY PROBLEMS YOU ENCOUNTER WITH OUR TASK TRACKER

THANKS THAT'S INFORMATIVE NOT
FILL ME UP
PYTHON 2 JUN MSC VERB BIT AMD ON WIN
TYPE HELP COPYRIGHT CREDITS OR LICENSE FOR MORE INFORMATION
FROM IMPORT BRACES
FILE LINE
SYNTAXERROR NOT A CHANCE
WHY HTTPS
BUT WHY
MAYBE IT'S GONNA BE USEFUL IF YOU DO IT PROPERLY I HATE PYTHON TABS EXTENSION OR A COMPLETE NEW IDE
DEATH TO BRACKETS
IF YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD I THINK THE AST MODULE WILL HELP YOU A LOT I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT YOU SPLIT YOU PROJECT INTO TWO SEPARATE ONES ONE TRANSLATOR THAT CONVERTS BETWEEN AND PYTHON STYLE AS WELL AS YOUR TEXT EDITOR THAT WILL USE YOUR LIBRARY THIS WAY PEOPLE CAN IF THEY FIND IT USEFUL USE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION FOR THEIR TEXT EDITOR OF CHOICE

HOWEVER I CAN SEE MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS APPROACH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A WRITTEN BY A NORMAL PYTHON DEVELOPER GETS TRANSLATED TO THIS AND MODIFIED WHEN CONVERTED BACK AGAIN FROM THE NEW TO PYTHON STYLE SOME LINES THAT WERE NEVER MODIFIED MAY BE CHANGED WHAT I'M SAYING IS I DON'T THINK THE PROCESS PYTHON PYTHON WILL ALWAYS RETURN THE SAME PYTHON FILE AGAIN THIS CAUSES TRACEABILITY ISSUES WHEN USING SOURCE CONTROL AS BUGS WILL BE HARDER TO PIN DOWN DUE TO MODIFICATIONS

IN THE END IF WHITESPACE DEPENDENT SYNTAX IS NOT YOUR THING PYTHON MAY NOT BE THE BEST LANGUAGE CHOICE FOR YOU THERE ARE OTHER LANGUAGES THAT FILL THAT GAP AND PYTHON IS NOT ONE OF THEM
HAVEN'T TOOK HIS COURSE BUT I ATTENDED A CONFERENCE WHERE HE SPOKE AT I ALSO HAD CUSTOM TRAINING TAUGHT BY CONTINUUM WITH MY COMPANY AND IT WAS GOOD
SIXTY NORTH HETP OFFERS SOME GOOD PYTHON TRAINING
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HETP
THEY SOMETIMES POST IN R LEARNPYTHON SEE HERE
R LEARNPYTHON COMMENTS

IT'S VIRTUAL BUT IT'S A LIVE CLASSICAL YOU HAVE CLASSES EVERY WEEK CODING SESSIONS THREE TIMES A WEEK AT THE END YOU WORK ON A GROUP PROJECT THEY INCORPORATE GIT AS WELL
USE FUNCTIONS IN CASES OF CODE THAT WILL BE CALLED MORE THAN ONCE IN A CELL JUST LIKE NORMAL PYTHON JUPITER IS FOR PROTOTYPING I WOULDNT WORRY ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF CODE BUT JUPITER IS A GREAT VISUALIZATION TOOL USE IT

2 USE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT FOR ME IF IM CREATING A NEW TENSORFLOW NETWORK I WILL CREATE A NEW JUPITER NOTEBOOK
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO JUST TYPE OUT THE COMMANDS WITHOUT WRAPPING THEM IN FUNCTIONS IF I END UP WANTING TO REUSE A PIECE OF CODE I MIGHT PREFACTOR IT TO A FUNCTION ANOTHER REASON TO CREATE FUNCTIONS IS THAT YOU CAN GIVE A PIECE OF CODE A DESCRIPTIVE NAME TO COMMUNICATE YOUR INTENT

REGARDING WHEN TO USE A NEW NOTEBOOK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ARE PREPARING THE NOTEBOOK FOR FOR EXAMPLE YOU OFTEN HAVE TO PREPROCESS DATA BEFORE YOU DO YOUR ANALYSIS IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO PUT THESE STEPS IN A SEPARATE NOTEBOOK IF IT STARTS TO HIDE THE IDEAS YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE YOU CAN THEN EITHER OUTPUT THE CLEANED DATA TO A CSF OR JASON AND LOAD THAT IN YOUR ANALYSIS NOTEBOOK OR USE THE MAGIC RUN COMMAND TO EXECUTE THAT NOTEBOOK
IT DOESN'T BODE TOO WELL WHEN THE COMMUNITY IS DOWNVOTING YOU LIKE HELL ON THE VERY SITE YOU WROTE YOUR ARTICLE ON
HERE'S A TINY ROADMAN YOU COULD START WITH

GET A FREE TIER AMAZON INSTANCE

2 WRITE A SCRIPT THAT WILL DO THE CHECKING AND LOG IT SOMEWHERE EAST G AMAZON'S DYNAMODB

SET UP A CRON TASK THAT WILL RUN THE SCRIPT PERIODICALLY

USE FLASK TO MAKE A LITTLE WEB INTERFACE FOR IT CHECK OUT THIS TUTORIAL ON FLASK

EDIT EVEN THOUGH THIS WILL HAVE A PRETTY STEEP LEARNING CURVE THESE ARE ALL GOOD TOOLS TO KNOW ABOUT AND COULD BE USED IN FUTURE ENDEAVORS
I WOULD GO FOR DURANGO AND A POSTURES DATABASE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SCHEDULE MONITOR AND DO LOT'S OF STUFF WITHOUT ACTUALLY NEEDING TO WRITE TOO MUCH CODE
THE PLUS IS THAT YOU WILL HAVE AN EASILY MANAGEABLE APPLICATION AND YOU CAN LEARN BACKEND APP DEVELOPMENT IT'S THE EASIEST PATH I THINK ONCE YOU GET YOUR HEAD AROUND IT
ABSOLUTELY KILLED MY SIDES
START PYTHON AND EXECUTE IMPORT DISTUTILS IF IT WORKS DISTUTILS IS INSTALLED IF IT THROWS AN ERROR IT IS NOT YOU CAN ALSO LOOK IN WHATEVER FOLDER PYTHON INSTALLED TO I DON'T KNOW WHERE ANACONDA PUTS IT AND OPEN THE LIB FOLDER LOOK IN THERE FOR DISTUTILS

AND FOR FUTURE REFERENCE THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS BELONG IN R LEARNPYTHON
GO BROWSE THE PYTHON DOCS AND STANDARD LIBRARY REFERENCE MOUILL LEARN WHAT'S INCLUDED AND HOW TO CHECK FOR THAT
HMM DIDN'T YOU RUN YOUR OWN CODE THROUGH YOUR OWN CODE SO WE HAVE A CLI TO GENERATE CLI FROM CODE

I DID SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT USING A SAML FILE IN PROJECT ROOT TO DEFINE THE COMMANDS USING EXISTING FUNCTIONS
WHY NOT HAVE FUNCTION INSTEAD OF GENERATING CODE
NOT TO BE MEAN OR ANYTHING BUT UHH

YOUR CODE LOOKS BAD LIKE REALLY REALLY BAD I WOULD NOT APPROVE OF ANY PULL REQUEST THAT LOOKED LIKE THIS THE BLANK LINES THE TABS SHIVER

LOOK OVER THE PEP AND FORMAT YOUR CODE ACCORDINGLY

FOR FUTURE NOTE YOU SHOULD TRY TO FORMAT ALL YOUR CODE ACCORDING TO THE PEP BEFORE MAKING IT PUBLIC
JESUS YOU REALLY LIKE BLANK LINES DO YOU
ARGH DOES THIS
WHY WON'T YOU USE DOCTORING FOR DESCRIPTION

NOT THAT I'D EVER NEED SUCH THING BUT WHY WON'T YOU JUST MAKE A DECORATOR FUNCTION WHICH READS AGS WARGUS AND DOCTORING TO PRINT OUT DESCRIPTION FOR FUNCTIONS

WE USE SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION IN JSONRPC SERVER FOR API FUNCTIONS
WHAT IS CLI
RIGHT NOW I'M WORKING ON A PROJECT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW SIMULTANEOUS INPUT AS WELL AS OUTPUT A BACKGROUND TASK WOULD THIS ALLOW ME TO IMPLEMENT THIS FUNCTIONALITY
I LIKE HOW YOU GENERATE THE CODE IT'S A NICE APPROACH DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT BUT THIS IS GREAT
GOOD JOB I WILL USE IT FOR PYSPARK I'M BUILDING RIGHT NOW
THANKS FOR SHARING
NICE WORK I LOVE THESE SORTS OF THINGS I MAINTAIN A HIGHLY OPINIONATED PACKAGE THAT DOES SOMETHING SIMILAR

SEE THE DECORATOR EXAMPLE

THE WHITE SPACING IS EXCESSIVE
SEEMS SUPER COOL IF YOU WANT TO TEST SOME FUNCTIONS WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF MAKING A FULL CLI
IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT YOU CAN WRITE UGLY CODE EVEN WITH PYTHON PUTTING AN EMPTY LINE AFTER EACH LINE AND DOING INCONSISTENTLY SO WAS A GENIUS IDEA CONGRATS

FOR THE LAST QUESTION I HAVEN'T READ YOUR CODE VERY THOROUGHLY BUT ONE THING I NOTICE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS THAT THE RECURSIVE IMPLEMENTATION DOESN'T DO THIS BIT

ZÜGE COUNT SPIELBRETT

SO I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO SUSPECT THAT MOST OF THE APPLICATION STATE ON EVERY MOVE WOULD SLOW THINGS DOWN CONSIDERABLY

OTHER THAN THAT RECURSION IS NOT INTRINSICALLY LESS PERFORMANT THAN ITERATION BUT IT TENDS TO BE IN PYTHON THIS IS A LANGUAGE DESIGN CHOICE IN A NUTSHELL THE RELEVANT PYTHON DEVELOPERS DO NOT BELIEVE IN RECURSION AS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGY AND SO THE LANGUAGE ENDS UP NOT BEING VERY GOOD AT IT THERE ARE THREE STRATEGIES AVAILABLE TO LANGUAGE DESIGNERS TO MAKE RECURSION EFFICIENT

TAIL CALL OPTIMIZATION CO MANY RECURSIVE PROBLEMS USE A SUBSET OF RECURSION PATTERNS KNOWN AS TAIL CALL RECURSION IT MEANS THAT THE LAST THING YOUR RECURSIVE FUNCTION DOES IS EITHER SHORT-CIRCUIT THE BASE CASE OR DIRECTLY RETURN THE RESULT OF A RECURSIVE CALL TO ITSELF THE RECURSIVE CASE SUCH A RECURSIVE CALL AT THE MACHINE CODE LEVEL AMOUNTS TO PUSH AGS CALL FUNCTION POP AGS RUN FUNCTION BODY PUSH RETURN VALUE POP RETURN VALUE PUSH RETURN VALUE RETURN AND THIS CAN BE SIMPLIFIED TO JUMP TO FUNCTION PUSH RETURN VALUE RETURN DOING THIS AVOIDS ADDING A STACK FRAME FOR EACH RECURSIVE CALL SO YOU DROP THE FUNCTION CALL OVERHEAD THE STACK OVERFLOW AND THE MEMORY LEAK
2 EXPLICIT RECURSION CONSTRUCTS CLOSURE DOES THIS THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T HAVE CO BUT GIVES YOU A LIMITED SYNTAX LOOP RECUR FOR RECURSIVE CALLS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PERFORM CO MANUALLY
LAZY EVALUATION THIS IS WHAT HASKELL DOES INSTEAD OF STRICTLY EVALUATING THE RECURSIVE CALL YOU RETURN A THUNK WHICH WILL BE EVALUATED AFTER THE FUNCTION RETURNS THE EFFECT IS SIMILAR TO DOING CO

PYTHON DOES NONE OF THESE SO RECURSION ENDS UP BEING EXPENSIVE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY THOUGH
FOR YOUR FIRST SIDE QUESTION SS SETRECURSIONLIMIT IS DOCUMENTED HERE
IS USUALLY NOT A MODERATELY HIGH NUMBER OF PARAMETERS FOR BAYESIAN INFERENCE

WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING GRADIENTS IF THAT DOESN'T EXCLUDE AUTODIFF LOOK INTO POSTMAN HMC MAY HELP WITH SAMPLING PROBLEMATIC POSTERIORS GIVEN YOUR DEGENERACY CORRELATION ISSUES
FELLOW ASTROPERSON HERE

MY SUGGESTION IS TO PARALLELIZE THE MODEL ITSELF AS OPPOSED TO CMC IN PARALLEL

I KNOW THAT EMCEE SUPPORTS RUNNING THE MODEL CALLS IN A PROCESS POOL BUT IN MOST CASES THE WHOLE SYSTEM GETS THROTTLED BY SERIALIZING DATA AND SENDING IT TO THE CHILD PROCESSES

IT LIKE PYMULTINEST AT SOME LEVEL SUPPORTS PARALLELIZATION BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THE INTENDED USE CASE IS TO DISTRIBUTE THE WORK AMONG MULTIPLE MACHINES ALL I SEE IS THAT PYMULTINEST PYMULTINEST INSPECTS UPI OF COURSE THIS RUNS INTO THE SAME PROBLEM WITH SERIALIZING DATA SO YOU NEED TO BE WARY

IF YOU NEED TO DO A LOT OF MATH FAST ON A MULTICORE MACHINE MY BEST SOLUTION IN PYTHON SO FAR IS TO USE JIT NOPYTHON TRUE NOGAL TRUE AND RUN IN A THREADPOOLEXECUTOR THIS ALSO HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF LETTING YOU DO REDUCTION OPERATIONS
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE ALREADY COMMERCIAL VENDORS THAT HANDLE THE DESCRIBED USE CASE FOR EXAMPLE ARTIFACTORY
DELETED
YOU COULD ALSO SIMPLY USE THE BUILT-IN HOOK THAT FLAKE WILL INSTALL AND MANAGE FOR YOU
THANKS FOR SHARING THIS I'VE USED HOOKS BEFORE BUT HADN'T THOUGHT OF USING A HOOK TO STOP THE BAD CODE GETTING COMMITTED IN THE FIRST PLACE
YOU CAN LOOK INTO THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF PYTHONDIALOG I KNOW THEY HAVE A TREE VIEW WINDOW OPTION AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF MENUS I MAINLY WORK WITH REGULAR MENUS INPUT BOXES AND YES NO BOXES OF THAT LIBRARY THOUGH I HAVEN'T TRIED A TREE VIEW
YES
IF YOUR GOAL IS TO CREATE BOTS PYTHON WOULD BE A GOOD CHOICE
YEAH PYTHON HAS EASIER SYNTAX THE OTHER LANGUAGES AND IDLE IS VERY EASY TO USE AND UNDERSTAND WITH RELATIVELY SIMPLE ERROR MESSAGES
YOU MAY WANT TO TRY R LEARNPYTHON

SO I MAY BE MISUNDERSTANDING YOU BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO AUTH IN THE APP THEN TELL YOUR FLASK API ABOUT THAT THAT'S INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC FOR A FEW REASONS

THE CLIENT ID AND SECRET ARE IN YOUR APP THESE ARE EASY TO FIND NOW I CAN PRETEND TO BE YOUR APP
2 YOU NEED SOME CRAZY LOGIC IN YOUR API FOR YOUR APP TO BE CONSIDERED VALID AGAIN I CAN PRETTY MUCH SEE WHATEVER YOUR APP IS DOING
YOU WANT TO ADD ANOTHER PROVIDER TWITTER OR THE NEW HOTNESS YOU ARE BOUND BY THE SPEED OF THE APP APPROVAL PROCESS

INSTEAD YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HAVING YOUR APP OPEN A WEB VIEW TO YOUR FLASK APPARENTLY THAT HANDLES THE FLOW WITH WHATEVER PROVIDER GOOGLE FACEBOOK THE NEXT HOT THING ETC THEN YOUR APP GENERATES YOUR OWN TOKEN TO BE USED WITH YOUR MOBILE APPARENTLY

THIS HAS A FEW BENEFITS

REGARDLESS OF AUTH 2 PROVIDER THEY APP SPEAKS YOUR BACKENDS SPEAK YOU DEFINE THE TOKENS AND WHAT YOU NEED IN THEM
2 I CANNOT EASILY SEE ANYTHING PERSONAL ABOUT YOUR IMPLEMENTATION EAST G ONLY THE SERVER HAS THE CLIENT SECRET IF IT SOMEHOW LEAKED YOU UPDATE IT IN ONE SPOT NOT NEEDING TO GO THROUGH THE APP STORE APPROVAL PROCESS IN ORDER TO GET IT UPDATED

ANYWAY LIKE I SAID I MAY BE MISUNDERSTANDING YOUR FLOW THAT'S JUST HOW I READ AND UNDERSTOOD IT APOLOGIES IF I GOT IT WRONG
WHY NOT SET YOURSELF A PROJECT WHERE YOU WEBSCRAPE THE JOB LISTINGS IN YOUR AREA TO LOOK AT THE DEMAND FOR PYTHON DEVELOPERS
BUT I HAVE HEARD PEOPLE SAYING DURANGO SUCK AND LEARN RUBY ON RAIL

AHAHAHA WHAT YEAR WAS THIS DURANGO IS THE CURRENT SAFE FRAMEWORK IF YOU KNOW DURANGO SOME QUERY AND A BIT OF LINUX SERVER MANAGEMENT YOU'RE BOUND TO FIND A JOB
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH DURANGO IT'S QUITE POPULAR AND I'D ENCOURAGE YOU TO FIND A JOB THAT USES IT FLASK IS ALSO ANOTHER POPULAR PYTHON OPTION IT'S VERY LIGHT-WEIGHT BUT LETS YOU EASILY PLUG IN YOUR OWN COMPONENTS DURANGO TAKES THE BATTERIES INCLUDED APPROACH WHICH IS MORE SIMILAR TO RAILS THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH EITHER APPROACH
PYTHON SYNTAX IS REALLY A SYNTAX THAT ONLY DESCRIBES LOVE

WOW THAT'S A NEW ONE

GIVE ME SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT TELLS ME WHAT ARE THE DEMAND IN PYTHON AND WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENT FOR IT

YOUR BEST BET WOULD BE LOOKING AT JOB ADS YOU WILL SEE THE MOST UP TO DATE THIS WEEK INFO AND EXACT REQUIREMENTS LISTED

OR CAN I JUST GET A SIMPLE PYTHON JOB THAT USE DIC LIST OBJECT JOIN METH AND ETC COME ON I JUST WANT TO GET JOB EVEN THE EARNING IS SILLAR TO WALMART JOB

I DOUBT IT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET LITTLE GIGS HERE AND THERE ON UPWORK OR SIMILAR SITES OR IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO TRUSTS LIKES YOU AND IS WILLING TO PAY YOU TO WRITE SOME SMALL PROGRAMS FOR THEM BUT IT'S A LONG SHOT
I WILL BE HONEST OTHER THAN FULL TIME DEVELOPER JOBS MOST OF THE INDUSTRY IS BASED AROUND FREELANCING

SO YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUILDING A PORTFOLIO WITH YOUR OWN PROJECT LIKE A WEBSITE GITHUB TOOLS ETC AND EXPAND YOUR JOB SEARCH TO CONTACTING SMALLER COMPANIES WITH PROPOSITIONS BOTH WILL WANT PORTFOLIOS

IN MY EXPERIENCE KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC LIBRARIES IS A BENEFIT NOT A REQUIREMENT BUT YOU HAVE TO SELL YOURSELF THIS MEANS IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE LIBRARY YOU CAN LEARN IT
DON'T THINK IN TERMS OF JUST PROGRAMMING OR USING PYTHON

THINK IN TERMS OF SOLVING PROBLEMS AND ADDING VALUE

PYTHON IS A TOOL THAT YOU CAN USE TO DO JUST THAT AND ONE OF MANY

WHAT KINDS OF PROBLEMS WELL WHAT FLOATS YOUR BOAT WHAT ARE YOU DRAWN TO

YOU MIGHT HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING PART TIME PROGRAMMING JOBS I'D LOVE TO FIND ONE BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE THAT SAID I LIKE THE IDEA SHARED IN REGARDS TO WRITING A SCRAPER TO FIND SUCH A POSTING IF YOU'RE A STUDENT YOU CAN PROBABLY BE AN EXCEPTION TO MY GENERALIZATION BY FINDING AN INTERNSHIP SOME INTERNSHIPS MIGHT NOT EVEN REQUIRE YOU TO BE A STUDENT THOUGH THEY COULD BE DIFFICULT TO LAND WITHOUT SOME COLLEGE WORK

DON'T WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE DISLIKING DURANGO THE WEB IS FULL OF STRONG OPINIONS AND THERE ARE ALSO A TON OF PEOPLE THAT ADORE DURANGO YOU'LL TEND TO FIND FAR MORE JOBS WITH PYTHON THAN RUBY ANYWAY SINCE ROK IS REALLY ONLY GOOD FOR WEB PYTHON IS HIGHLY PRIZED IN A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS AS WELL AS WEB IF YOU WANT TO START WITH SOMETHING EASIER THAN DURANGO YOU COULD TRY SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE FLASK

FINALLY A LOT OF JOBS WHERE YOU'LL WRITE PYTHON WILL BE PRIMARILY A JOB IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE I WORK A C JOB ON PAPER BUT WE HAVE SOME PYTHON APPS WRITTEN WITH FLASK AND SQL ALCHEMY WE'VE NEVER POSTED A PYTHON POSITION OFFICIALLY BUT THERE ARE USUALLY AT LEAST ONE TO TWO DEVELOPERS WRITING PYTHON EACH WEEK

YOUR CITY IS LARGE ENOUGH TO FIND PURE PYTHON JOBS AS FAR AS ANY JOB IS ONLY ONE LANGUAGE AT LEAST WHICH IS USUALLY NEVER TOTALLY THE CASE AND THAT'S A GREAT LANGUAGE TO BUILD A CAREER UPON BUT FEEL FREE TO FIND MULTIPLE LANGUAGES TO LOVE
WHY NOT PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT AND DO SOME RESEARCH YOURSELF
IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE TO MAKE A LIVING WITH DURANGO PROJECTS LOOK FOR SUPERGROUPS METUMPS IN YOUR AREA TO FIND CONTACTS

ALSO WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR COMMAS
NOT SURE HOW MUCH TIME YOU'RE PLAYING WITH BUT IF YOU CAN PICK UP ANOTHER SKILL THAT YOU WILL ENJOY MARRY IT TO BEING ABLE TO SOLVE INDUSTRY PROBLEMS WITH PYTHON OR ANY OTHER LANGUAGE IT WILL GET YOU IN THE DOOR I DID IT BACKWARDS I'M ON THE BUSINESS SIDE AND LEARNED PYTHON TO USE AS A TOOL TO SOLVE BUSINESS PROBLEMS ON THE FINANCIAL AND ADMIN SIDE FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE A WHOLE GROUP OF FINANCIAL EXCEL FILES THAT HAVE TO BE PULLED TOGETHER EACH MONTH TO CREATE A MONTHLY REPORT THEN A SUMMARY HAS TO BE PULLED TOGETHER AND SENT TO THE BOSS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DID WAS WRITE A SCRIPT USING BLOWINGS WHICH IS A PYTHON MODULE TO GRAB ALL THE EXCEL FILES IN THE MONTHLY FOLDER CONSOLIDATE THEM INTO ONE WORKBOOK THEN ANALYZE THEM CHART PROGRESS AND PROVIDE A SUMMARY IN A TEXT FILE WHICH COULD BE COPIED DIRECTLY INTO AN EMAIL TO SEND TO WHOEVER WAS INTERESTED IN HOW WE'RE DOING I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY HAPPY FACES AROUND THE CONFERENCE TABLE APPROACHED IT PROBLEMATICALLY HARD WORK UP FRONT BUT NOW TAKES LESS THAN MINUTES TO RUN THE SCRIPTURE MOST MANAGERS ON THE BUSINESS SIDE DON'T HAVE PROGRAMMING AS A SKILL I'M SURE THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR OTHER SPHERES

YOU COULD DO THIS IN PRETTY MUCH ANY INDUSTRY WITH AN ADDITIONAL SKILL IF YOU LIKE FASHION FOR EXAMPLE BUST YOUR LEARNING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY NETWORK LIKE CRAZY AND THEN OFFER YOURSELF OUT AS A CONSULTANT TO START AND PROVE YOU HAVE VALUE GETTING YOU IN THE DOOR FOR PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT ANALYZING VISUALIZING A SECTION OF THEIR HISTORICAL DATA SUCH AS RETAIL PURCHASE INFO TO LET THEM KNOW WHERE THEY CAN IMPROVE SOLE IF THEY ALREADY DO THIS SEE IF YOU CAN SPEED UP THEIR PROCESS AND MOVE THEM AWAY FROM MANUAL ANALYSIS



SERIOUSLY I'M SURE THAT CREATING YOUR OWN CRYPTOGRAPHY MODULE IS A VERY GOOD LEARNING EXPERIMENT YOU SHOULD CONTINUE ON THIS ROUTE AND CONTINUE TO EXPERIMENT AND LEARN ABOUT CRYPTOGRAPHY ALONG THE WAY

CRYPTOGRAPHY IS A COMPLEX TOPIC AS OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT AND YOU SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT OR THAT YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT EVERY POSSIBLE CORNER CASE OR EXPLOIT

FOR PRODUCTION CODE MY OPINION IS THAT YOU SHOULD STICK TO WELL-KNOWN LIBRARIES THAT IS UNLESS YOU'RE A CRYPTOGRAPHY EXPERT REASON THOSE LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN AND INVOLVE MANY YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT AND WISDOM
NUMBER USE DON'T MAKE YOUR OWN CRYPTO
MY FAVORITE ONE IS TALK PYTHON TO ME BUT FOR GOD SAKES THE GUY NEEDS TO CHANGE THE INTRO SONG ITS THE MOST IRRITATING NERDCORE RAPPER OR SOMETHING ALSO HE IS ALWAYS PROMOTING PYCHARM MAKING ME SUS
I'LL TAKE THIS CHANCE TO RECOMMEND MY FAVORITE PROGRAMMING PODCAST PROGRAMMING THROWDOWN HETP IT'S NOT PYTHON SPECIFIC SO PROBABLY NOT SUITABLE FOR YOUR LIST BUT THEY HAVE EPISODES ON PYTHON AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC PYTHON


PODCAST IS OK BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE HOST IS SO TIRED OF THIS EVERY EPISODE
SO MANY PODCASTS SO LITTLE TIME I CAN DEFINITELY TO

TALK PYTHON TO ME
PODCAST
THIS IS GREAT THANKS FOR POSTING I'VE BEEN MEANING TO LISTEN TO PODCASTS FOR A WHILE NOW AND I MIGHT TRY SOME OF THESE OUT

USEFUL LIST I APPRECIATE YOU POSTING IT

IF YOU DON'T KNOW OF ANYTHING WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO COLLABORATE ON THE MENTIONED REBUILD OF SUCH A LIBRARY
MAYBE MONGOENGINE IT PROVIDES AN INTERFACE TO WRAP MONGO OBJECTS AROUND THE CLASS AS DOES PYMONGO AND A FACTORY INTERFACE TO CREATE DOCUMENT DEFINITIONS

I USED TO DEFINE A DYNAMICDOCUMENT MODEL WITH ONLY THE ID DEFINED AND SAVE JASON TO THE MODEL
CHRISANTONELLIS

I'M THE AUTHOR THIS IS STILL IN HEAVY ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT IT FULLY SUPPORTS DEEP SETTING AND GETTING OF DEEP NESTED VALUES VIA DOT NOTATION SYNTAX
I TRIED PIP INSTALL DETECTED AFTER RUNNING DET WITH A WEBPAGE IT GIVES A FILENOTFOUNDERROR NOT FOUND
YOU SHOULD TRY TO AVOID USING PIP ESPECIALLY THE WAY YOU ARE USING IT WITH EUDO BECAUSE CHANCES ARE THAT IT MIGHT OVERRIDE FILES INSTALLED BY SYSTEM PACKAGES AND THAT ONLY LEADS TO FURTHER PROBLEMS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT COULD CAUSE ISSUES
2 IF YOU WANT TO USE PIP YOU SHOULD USE PYTHON PIP PACKAGE I DON'T KNOW EXACT NAME ON FEDORA
WHEN USING PIP IT'S RECOMMENDED TO EITHER INSTALL THINGS WITH USER OPTION IT INSTALL IN HOME DIRECTORY SO NO EUDO NEEDED OR CREATE A VIRTUALENV FIRST WITH PYTHON YOU CAN JUST TYPE PYVENV SOURCE BIN ACTIVATE AND THEN CALL PIP THIS WAY PIP WON'T TRY OVERWRITE SYSTEM PACKAGES AND ALSO WON'T REQUIRE ROOT NO NEED TO USES EUDO
IF YOU USE VIRTUALENV PIP SHOULD BE INSTALLED BUT IF IT'S NOT AFTER SOURCING ACTIVATE SCRIPT YOU CAN TYPE PYTHON M ENSUREPIP AGAIN RUN IT ONLY IN VIRTUALENV OR YOU COULD MESS UP YOUR SYSTEM BY OVERWRITING SYSTEM FILES
DELETED
WHY NOT BOTH
BUT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO I WOULD RECOMMEND PYTHON BECAUSE YOU CAN DO SO MUCH WITH IT LIKE RUN A WEB FRAMEWORK WITH DURANGO OR FLASK OR BUILD GAMES WITH PREGAME REALLY YOU CAN DO A LOT WITH BOTH BUT JAVASCRIPT IN MY EXPERIENCE IS BETTER FOR MAKING DYNAMIC WEBPAGES AND PYTHON IS BETTER FOR BEHIND THE SCENES TASKS WAS THERE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF TASK YOU WERE LOOKING TO DO FIXED SPELLING
SALARY SHOULD BE SEGREGATED BY JOB TYPES NOT LANGUAGE YOU SEE JAVASCRIPT SALARY FOR WHAT NODES OR FRONTED I BET SALARY SCALE IS VERY DIFFERENT JAVA IS WHAT JAVA EE OR ANDROID FOR PYTHON I KNOW WEB DEVELOPER SALARY IS DIFFERENT FROM A DATA SCIENCE ONES EXCEPT ABYE FOR RUBY RUBY MEANS RAILS

PEOPLE GET PAID FOR THE TYPE OF JOB THEY DO AND THEIR SKILL LEVEL AND NOT THE LANGUAGE THEY USE
THANKS FOR SHARING THAT THERE IS A TON OF INFO THERE DO YOU GUYS HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO FIND A PYTHON JOB BY STATE I WILL BE LOOKING FOR PYTHON WORK NEXT YEAR AND IT NEEDS TO BE IN A SPECIFIC STATE
CLEAN ARCHITECTURES IN PYTHON ALLUDES TO SOME GUIDE BY WHICH ONE CAN ARCHITECT A PYTHON PROJECT CLEANLY INSTEAD THIS BLOG SEEMS TO TRY TO DESCRIBE THE ARCHITECTURE OF A SINGLE PROJECT AND ONE HAS TO READ PAGE AFTER PAGE OF TEXT AND CODE BEFORE ANY DESCRIPTION IS REACHED NOT VERY WELL ORGANIZED IMO HOW ABOUT A CML DIAGRAM OR SOMETHING AS A PREFACE
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE MODELS IN THIS LAYER ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE USUAL MODELS OF FRAMEWORK LIKE DURANGO THESE MODELS ARE NOT CONNECTED WITH A STORAGE SYSTEM SO THEY CANNOT BE DIRECTLY SAVED OR QUERIED USING METHODS OF THEIR CLASSES THEY MAY HOWEVER CONTAIN HELPER METHODS THAT IMPLEMENT CODE RELATED TO THE BUSINESS RULES

I DISAGREE WITH MUCH OF THIS I DO AGREE THAT THESES AREN'T DURANGO OR SQLALCHEMY MODELS

HOWEVER ENTITIES ARE DISTINCT OBJECTS THAT HAVE A LIFETIME OUTSIDE OF A REQUEST THEY CHANGE OVER TIME A ROOM MIGHT BE IN A FAULT ZONE AND AFTER A PARTICULARLY BAD EARTH QUAKE IT'S LOCATION COULD CHANGE PRICES FLUCTUATE BAD ON DEMAND AND THE ECONOMY ETC

AS FOR QUERYING IT DEPENDS ON

WHAT YOU MEAN BY QUERYING
IF IT'S A TOP LEVEL ENTITY

YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ABLE TO QUERY FOR A SPECIFIC ENTITY OR A COLLECTION OF ENTITIES MEETING CRITERIA THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU NECESSARILY EXECUTE A DATABASE QUERY

A QUERY SHOULD TAKE THE FORM OF I NEED TO KNOW WHAT ROOMS IN THIS BOUNDING BOX ARE FREE ON THE OF NOVEMBER AND THAT WOULD BE TRANSLATED INTO SOMETHING THE DOMAIN UNDERSTANDS MAYBE IT GOES TO THE NETWORK MAYBE IT GOES TO DISK MAYBE IT GIVES A CANNED RESPONSE

BUT YOUR QUERY MIGHT END UP LOOKING LIKE

WITHINBOX AVAILABLEON DATE

WHAT EVER IS DONE WITH THAT IS UP TO THE REPOSITORY IMPLEMENTATION

AS FOR WHAT I MEAN BY A TOP LEVEL ENTITY THERE ARE ENTITIES THAT EXIST SOLELY TO SERVE THIS TOP LEVEL ONE YOU SHOULDN'T QUERY FOR THESE DIRECTLY OR HOLD A REFERENCE TO THEM AN EXAMPLE MIGHT BE A RENTAL AGREEMENT FOR ONE OF THESE ROOMS BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU'VE MODELED YOUR DOMAIN

DIVORCING YOUR DOMAIN MODEL AND PERSISTENCE MODEL IS IMPORTANT THE DATABASE SHOULD BE BEHOLDEN TO YOUR APPLICATION NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK HERE THOUGH

BUT THE PART I DISAGREE WITH MOST IS

THEY MAY HOWEVER CONTAIN HELPER METHODS THAT IMPLEMENT CODE RELATED TO THE BUSINESS RULES

YOUR ENTITIES SHOULD BE THE BACKBONE OF YOUR MODEL YOU SOUND THINK IN TERMS OF WHAT DOES THIS ENTITY DO NOT WHAT DATA DOES THIS ENTITY CONTAIN

WHAT DOES A ROOM DO IN YOUR MODEL YOU'D PROBABLY ASK IT QUESTIONS LIKE ARE YOU FREE ON X DATE YOU'D ASK IT TO PRODUCE A RENTAL AGREEMENT FOR A PERIOD

CLASS STORAGEROOM
DEF SELF PERIOD
DEF BOOK SELF PERIOD
DEF ESTIMATE SELF PERIOD

YOU MIGHT HAVE A SEPARATE DOMAIN MODEL CALLED RENTEDROOM THAT HANDLES THINGS LIKE STORAGE

BUT THE METHODS PUBLICLY EXPOSED IN YOUR ENTITIES ARE THE USE CASES

WHAT YOU HAVE LABELED USE CASES LOOK MORE LIKE COMMAND OBJECTS TO ME SOME OBJECT THAT'S BASICALLY A SERIALIZED METHOD CALL LOOKING FOR ITS INSTANCE I'M HO-HUM ON THESE THEY'RE HANDY IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO ASYNC PROCESSING JUST DEMO THEM OFF INTO A QUEUE AND LET SOMEONE ELSE HANDLE THEM BUT IN THE OTHER YOU COULD JUST INVOKE WHATEVER PUBLIC API THE DOMAIN EXPOSES DIRECTLY

IF YOU'RE GONNA ASK ABOUT CROSS CUTTING CONCERNS THAT'S WHAT THINGS LIKE DOMAIN AND APPLICATION SERVICES ARE FOR FUNCTIONALLY THESE ARE THE SAME TAKE RELATED OBJECTS AND STITCH THEIR OPERATIONS TOGETHER INTO A COHESIVE WHOLE BUT IT'S MORE WHAT SEMANTICALLY THEY REPRESENT IF SOMETHING ONLY TALKS IN TERMS OF ROOMS AND AGREEMENTS IT'S A DOMAIN SERVICE IF IT TOUCHES STUFF LIKE COOKIES AND SESSIONS IT'S AN APPLICATION SERVICE UNLESS YOUR DOMAIN INVOLVES COOKIES AND SESSIONS
I HAVE GENERAL QUESTION ABOUT METHODS IF I HAVE DICTIONARY ISN'T EASIER AND SAFER TO PUT IT INTO

STORAGEROOM MYDICT


CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT WENT WRONG

YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS IS WHAT WENT WRONG

CMAC SPECIFICALLY ISN'T RESUMABLE TO AVOID LENGTH EXTENSION ATTACKS TO WHICH EAST G SHAS CAN BE VICTIM TO

SINCE PBKDF 2 APPLIES ITERATION ROUNDS OF CMAC IT SPECIFICALLY CAN'T BE RESUMABLE EITHER ON PURPOSE

AND PBKDF 2 DOES NOT JUST THE RESULT OF THE PREVIOUS CMAC IT ALSO BORS ALL OF THEM TOGETHER

HOWEVER THE PARAMETER ITERATIONS DOES NOT WORK AS I EXPECT IT TO

THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE ON PBKDF 2 EXPLAINS HOW IT BEHAVES AND WHAT ITERATIONS MEANS

AS THE FOLLOWING SIMPLE CODE SHOWS WHEN I TRY TO CALL THE FUNCTION TWICE WITH ONE ITERATION I GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER THEN WHEN I CALL IT ONCE WITH TWO ITERATIONS

WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED

SINCE HASHING FUNCTIONS ARE DETERMINISTIC BOTH METHODS SHOULD YIELD THE SAME RESULT

NUMBER
I BELIEVE THAT IN THE EVEN OPERATIONS THE PREVIOUS RESULT PLUS SALT IS HASHED IN ODD ITERATION THE PREVIOUS RESULT PLUS THE PASSWORD IS HASHED SO YOU DO NOT GET THE RESULTS THAT YOU EXPECT BUT THE PBKDF 2 IS MEANT TO BE USED THAT WAY

SINCE YOU USE SMALL ITERATION COUNTS I'M GONNA PASTE MY OPINION ABOUT ITERATIONS IN PBKDF 2

THE IDEA IS THAT YOU USE EAST G 2 ITERATIONS WHEN DERIVING AN ENCRYPTION KEY TO INCREASE THE COST OF BRUTE FORCING THE PASSWORD

A GOOD PASSWORD CHARS OF UPPER LOWER NUMBERS SYMBOLS OR BETTER JUST WORDS HAS SOMETHING LIKE 2 POSSIBILITIES I EAST BIT INFORMATION CONTENTION

BY USING PBKKDF 2 WITH 2 ITERATIONS THE PASSWORDSTRENGTH GETS ELEVATED TO ONE WITH BIT WHICH WOULD BE BETWEEN AND CHARACTERS


MY MACHINE DOES 2 ITERATIONS PER SEC SO EACH TIME I DERIVE THE KEY FROM THE PASSWORD IT TAKES ME THAT SECOND

THE ENTIRE BISCOTIN NETWORK COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE 2 ITERATIONS PER SEC WITH AN ITERATION COUNT OF ONLY THEY CAN CRACK YOUR PASSWORD IN SECOND FOR WITH AN ITERATION COUNT OF 2 IT TAKES DAYS AND COSTS MILLION

YOU MUST USE UNIQUE SALTS SO THAT FOR EVERY INSTANCE WHERE STUFF IS ENCRYPTED THE WHOLE EFFORT HAS TO BE SPEND AGAIN OTHERWISE THEY DO FANCY RAINBOW TABLES AND AVOID ALL THAT COST


I CHECKED A YEAR AGO THEY DO 2 SHA HASHES PER SECOND NOT BUT IT GIVES AN ESTIMATE OF LARGE COMPUTING POWER AND COST THEY EARNED MTH LIKE PER SECOND

TL R

LARGE ITERATION COUNTS PROTECT A MEDIOCRE PASSWORD FROM BRUTEFORCE ATTACK THE TIME YOUR COMPUTER NEEDS TO COMPUTE IS LESS THAN WHAT TYPING REMEMBERING A LONGER PASSWORD WOULD BE

THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO ASK FOR SOMEONE TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK IF YOU INSIST ON NOT DOING THIS YOURSELF AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY TO PAY SOMEONE TO DO IT
USE A LOOP TO GO THROUGH THE LETTERS IN THE STRING AND THEN USE THE TIME LIB TO DO THE WAITING FOR YOU

NOT GOING TO PROVIDE MORE HELP THAN THAT YOU GOT THIS ON YOUR OWN IF SOMEONE ELSE DOES EVERYTHING FOR YOU THEN YOU WON'T LEARN A THING AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST DO IT IN BATCH INSTEAD

THIS IS ONLY FOR THE PYTHON REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION BUT THE ID OF AN OBJECT IS ITS MEMORY ADDRESS OBJECTS FOR SMALL INTEGERS ARE PREALLOCATED IN AN ARRAY SO WHEN PYTHON NEEDS TO GET IT JUST GRABS IT FROM THE SLOT WHERE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE IF YOU SUBTRACT IDS YOU SEE THAT THEY ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER

JUST MAKE YOUR OWN API WRAPPER IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE

MY PREFERRED WAY IS TO INSTALL THE APP FOR THE API I WANT ON MY OLD ANDROID PHONE ROOTED AND INSTALLED MY OWN SECURITY CERTIFICATE ON IT FOR HTTPS TRAFFIC SINCE JUST ABOUT EVERY APP USES API TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE BACK END SERVERS I FIND THIS TO BE THE EASIEST WAY YOU CAN ALSO DO IT ON A PC BUT I HAVEN'T TRIED IT FOR MY PROJECTS I THEN RUN IT THROUGH A ITM PROXY ON MY COMPUTER I USE FIDDLER BUT WIRESHARK OR ANY OTHER ITM PROXY WILL WORK

THEN ON THE APP DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT YOUR PROJECT TO DO SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE API DOES TO REQUEST THE INFO YOU WANT ONCE YOU HAVE THE PACKETS CAPTURED IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DECIPHERING WHAT IT IS THAT'S GOING ON LIKE HOW TO GENERATE A VALID API TOKEN WHAT INFO IS SENT IN THE HEADER AND WHAT KIND OF INFO IS SENT BACK SORT THROUGH JASON DATA FOR WHAT YOU NEED IF THE REPLY HAS JASON ETC

THEN JUST IMPORT REQUESTS INTO YOUR PROJECT AND REPLICATE YOUR FINDINGS PROGRAMMATICALLY

SOME WORDS OF CAUTION IF THEY CHANGE THEIR API CHANCES ARE YOU'RE PROJECT WILL STOP WORKING ALSO DON'T HAMMER THEIR SERVERS OR THEY'LL PROBABLY BAN YOU

I'VE USED THIS METHOD FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS CONTROL MY GARAGE DOOR OPENER VIEW WEEKLY CIRCULARS AND IT WORKS FINE THE BACK END SERVERS THINK I'M JUST JOE SCHMO SURFING THEIR APP FROM MY PHONE

FOR THE FUTURE I WOULD LIKE TO CREATE A LITTLE WEBAPP WITH A SIMPLE INTERFACE THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO JUST TYPE IN A WORD AND SAVE IT TO A DATABASE OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT AND THE PROGRAM WILL FIND IT'S DEFINITION

THEN MAYBE I CAN TAKE IT FURTHER AND MAKE IT TO ALLOW DIFFERENT USERS TO SIGN UP AND TO MAKE THEIR OWN LIST OF WORDS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW THE MEANING OF



IF ANYBODY HAS SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT I SHOULD LEARN TO IMPLEMENT THIS THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED


THIS WAS THE FIRST REAL WORLD PROBLEM PROJECT THAT I HAVE DONE THAT ISN'T JUST A LITTLE FIND ALL OF THE PRIME NUMBERS UP TO X SO I'M QUITE PROUD OF IT IT ISN'T FLASH AND THE CODE COULD DEFINITELY BE CLEANER BUT FOR RIGHT NOW IT HELPS ME TO COMMIT WORDS THAT I DIDN'T PREVIOUSLY KNOW TO MEMORY


IT LOOKS LIKE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED DOCUMENTATION WHICH CAN BE USEFUL BUT NOT WHEN IT ONLY STATES WHAT'S IN THE SIGNATURE

ANY DOCUMENTATION INTENDED TO BE USED BY SOMEONE NOT ON THE TEAM WRITING THE SOFTWARE SHOULD HAVE USEFUL EXAMPLES OF USE
INCLUDING TESTS CAN BE ENORMOUSLY USEFUL FOR THAT AS LONG AS THEY AREN'T TOO ABSTRACT

I DON'T NORMALLY READ ENTIRE BLOG POSTS BUT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WRITING STYLE IN THIS ONE

EDIT AND THIS WRITING IS INSUFFERABLE

DON'T HESITATE TO START PROJECTS BUT ALSO GET BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTALS TO IMPROVE WHAT YOU DID

IT'S SANITY TO READ AGAIN CODE YOU WROTE FEW WEEKS AGO AND THINK HOW DIFFERENT BETTER YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING

AND THAT APPEND WITH

BOOKS
EXPERIENCE
NICE POST YEA IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA IF YOU CAN TRY TO CREATE A PROGRAM AROUND ONE OF YOUR MAIN INTERESTS PYTHON IS REALLY GOOD FOR THIS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE A SIMULATION OR WEBSITE QUICKLY WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER LANGUAGES
NICE ARTICLE EVEN THOUGH I KINDA KNEW BEFORE READING IT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T AND JUST KEEP DOING EXERCISES WITHOUT ANY CONTEXT WHICH ISN'T BAD BUT IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS HAVING THAT SPARK
THE MAIN ISSUE FOR ME EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT I NEED THAT GOAL IS FINDING OUT WHAT GOAL I WANT
I AGREE

SO MANY CODERS ARE GRUMPY INTROVERTS WHO WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE SHIT AT CODING AND SHOULDN'T BOTHER WRITING A LINE OF CODE UNTIL YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT PERFECTLY

THE REALITY IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO START LEARNING SOMEWHERE I LEARNED PYTHON BY BUILDING A SERIES OF APPS IN PREGAME IRONICALLY NOT GAMES WITH CUSTOM THAT RELIED ON LOOPS

CONTRARY TO EXPERT OPINION YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING YOU LIKE ONCE YOU KNOW THE SIMPLE LOGIC OF A LOOP IT MAY NOT BE PRETTY BUT YOU CAN STICKY TAPE ANYTHING INTO A LOOP THAT'S WHEN THE FUN STARTS ONCE YOU'VE TOGETHER A POS APP THAT RUNS OFF SOME BYZANTINE LOOP YOU CAN THEN TEACH YOURSELF TO SIMPLIFY THE CODE BY MAKING REALLY STUPID MISTAKES WHICH ARE NATURAL BTW YOU CAN SLOWLY TRAIN YOURSELF TO NOT MAKE THOSE MISTAKES

IMO FOR TOO LONG NECKBEARDS HAVE RULED THE WORLD OF CODING WITH OVERLY HARSH OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD CODE HAVING LEARNED A FEW HUMAN LANGUAGES JAPANESE AND ENGLISH ITALIAN IS MY NATIVE TONGUE I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT I LEARNED BOTH BY TALKING TO PEOPLE AND BEING LAUGHED UP IF YOU JUST SIT IN A ROOM THE THEORY THEN IMO YOU RISK TURNING INTO A NECKBEARD WHO CAN TELL EVERYBODY WHO'S EXPERIMENTING THEY ARE SHIT BUT WILL PISS EVERYBODY OFF AT WORK BECAUSE YOU'LL BE TOO MUCH OF A PERFECTIONIST BEING PRACTICAL IS OFTEN VERY GOOD
I WISH THERE WAS ANYTHING I CARE ABOUT AND CAN MANAGE WITH
I'VE WRITTEN SEVERAL BASH SCRIPTS TO MAKE MY LIFE EASIER OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS I LAUNCHED MYSELF INTO PYTHON A FEW WEEKS AGO AND AM GOING THROUGH REWRITING ALL OF THEM MARVELLING REGULARLY AT HOW MUCH BETTER PYTHON OR PROBABLY ANY ACTUAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DOES THINGS

I LEARNED PASCAL AT SCHOOL THEN SPENT SOME TIME WITH DELPHI THEN A TOUCH OF C AND THEN PRETTY MUCH NOTHING BUT BATCH AND BASH SCRIPTS UNTIL I MET PYTHON I CAN SEE MYSELF USING IT EXCLUSIVELY FROM HERE ON OUT IT'S WONDERFUL
IT SEEMS ALL ABOUT MOTIVATION THANK YOU
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A GREAT IDEA MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF PROGRAMMING WAS WRITING A SCRAPER FOR TWITTER DATA AND I'VE SINCE WRITTEN BOTS BASIC ANALYTICS SOFTWARE AND ALSO STARTED MESSING AROUND WITH FLASK TO BUILD THIS ALL OF THIS WITH ZERO PROGRAMMING EDUCATION
FIRST PROJECT WAS A TIP CALCULATOR THAT TIPPED BASED ON A RATING YOU GAVE THE SERVER ON A SCALE OF NOW WHENEVER I FEEL I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH I JUST REMEMBER THAT I HAVE SEEN A PROJECT FROM START TO FINISH AND HEY IF I CAN MAKE THIS THAN I CAN MAKE ANYTHING I WANT IF I PUT THE EFFORT IN

NOW I'M WORKING ON MY FIRST TWITTER BOTANY THE START WAS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS BUT SINCE GETTING THOSE SOLVED IT'S STARTING TO COME TOGETHER

TL R TITLE IS RIGHT
THIS HITS HOME FOR ME AS I CHANGED CAREERS EARLIER THIS YEAR FROM SYSTEMS ENGINEERING TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AT AGE IF THAT MATTERS I DID IT ENTIRELY FROM SELF-TEACHING AND THE LYNCHPIN OF MY PORTFOLIO WAS A PROJECT THAT WAS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY INTERESTS AND I'VE REFRACTURED THE ENTIRE SITE ABOUT TIMES I DID IT AS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND I LEARNED A TON WOULD RECOMMEND
HOW IS THIS A PYTHON POST EXCEPT FOR THE FACT YOU USED PMC FOR YOUR CMC COMPUTATIONS NEVERTHELESS YOU'RE DESCRIBING THE KERNEL OF A PROCESS WHICH ALREADY GOES INTO MOST OF THE COMMON POLLING ANALYSES LIKE THE ONE FROM FIVETHIRTYEIGHT
I THINK YOU HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TRAP OF THINKING THERE ARE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE ANSWERS

THE POLL QUESTIONS SHOULD HAVE THESE OPTIONS

Q WHO WILL YOU VOTE FOR

A CLINTON

B TRUMP

COUNTY OTHER WRITE-IN

D NOBODY WILL NOT VOTE

EAST UNDECIDED


YOUR PREMISE THAT SOCIAL DESIRABILITY IS THE REASON FOR POLLING ERROR MAY BE TRUE IN THE SWEDISH CASE BUT I DON'T SEE WHY IT WOULD BE A FACTOR IN THE CASE OF BREVIT AND PROMINENT STATISTICIANS SILVER AND GELMAN FOR EXAMPLE HAVE REJECTED IT AS AN EXPLANATION FOR POLLING ERROR IN THE RECENT US ELECTION I WOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO BLAME DIFFERENTIAL NONRESPONSIVE AND I DON'T SEE HOW YOUR COIN TOSSING GAME WOULD SOLVE THAT
THANKS FOR SHARING THAT'S AN INTERESTING APPROACH
ALMOST EVERY PERSON WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT RECOMMENDS PYTHON PEOPLE ARE USING PYTHON 2 BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME LEGACY CODE THAT WAS BUILT WITH IT OR BECAUSE THEIR FIELD REQUIRES NONE OF THE PYTHON FEATURES
A LOT OF CODE IS VERSION NEUTRAL SO IF YOU KNOW PYTHON YOU KNOW PYTHON 2 MINUS FEW SYNTAX FEATURES SOME DIFFERENT IMPORTS AND SO ON PYTHON IS THE CURRENT FUTURE AND SUPPORTED VERSION WHILE PYTHON 2 WILL END IN SOME TIME
LEARN PYTHON IT'S BETTER THAN PYTHON 2
OME THIS SENTIMENT STILL AROUND
IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING LEARNING JUST DO 2 IS ONLY USEFUL FOR THOSE IN EXISTING ENVIRONMENTS SUPPORTING LEGACY CODE AND IF YOU ARE JUST LEARNING I DOUBT YOU ARE DEALING WITH LEGACY CODE
WHY NOT PYTHON
LEARN PYTHON
2 OR DOESN'T MATTER ALTHOUGH IS REGARDED AS THE FUTURE OF THE LANGUAGE
MOST OF THE TIMES DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM AREN'T PAINFUL
THE LAST THREE PROJECTS I'VE DONE AT WORK HAVE BEEN PYTHON ONLY
I RECOMMEND YOU TO LEARN PYTHON AND I BET THAT AT SOME POINT PEOPLE WILL STOP SUPPORTING PYTHON 2 X FOR THEIR PACKAGES LIBRARIES THIS IS NOT THE CASE RIGHT NOW BUT MY GUESS IS THAT IT WILL EVENTUALLY HAPPEN
WE'VE ALSO RELEASED A NEW DEMO VIDEO SHOWING THE FEATURES IN USE

FIRST VERSION OF A TOMVIZ USER GUIDE WAS DEVELOPED

AS MENTIONED IN THE LAST RELEASE POSTED TO THIS SUBREDDIT
ADDITIONAL TOMOGRAPHY DATASETS MADE OPEN AND PUBLIC IN NANOMATERIAL DATASETS TO ADVANCE TOMOGRAPHY IN SCANNING TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY SCIENTIFIC DATA


HARD TO GO WRONG WITH PYCHARM I'D SUGGEST LOOKING INTO PYTHON JUPITER AS WELL

I SUPPOSE THE EXISTING LIBRARIES ARE MAINLY IN PYTHON 2 THUS PROBABLY NOT WORTH GOING TO YET

THIS IS A TERRIBLE ASSUMPTION CHECK THE ONES YOU INTEND TO USE DECIDE FROM THERE MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE BIG NAMES IN DATA PROCESSING ARE COMPATIBLE BUMPY PANDAS TONS OF GRAPHING PLOTTING LIBS
TOTAL BEGINNER HERE IS THE IDE THE PROGRAM THAT I INPUT PYTHON CODE INTO THAT COMPILES AND RUNS IT

I USE ANACONDA NAVIGATOR SNYDER ON THE MAC FOR A PHYSICS STUDENT WITH SOME INTRO TO PYTHON AND A ITCH FOR MASTERING IT WHICH I'M HOPING TO SCRATCH SOON IS THIS A GOOD IDE

SORRY IF IT'S BENEATH THIS THREAD SUB IT'S DIFFICULT TO EVEN START TO FIND MY WAY AROUND SPAIN WHEN EVERYONE'S SPEAKING SPANISH
DON'T GO FOR IDE YET GO FOR SIMPLE TEXT EDITORS AND THE TERMINAL OR YOU CAN GO FOR ANACONDA WHICH COMES WITH JUPITER NOTEBOOK

I'M PERSONALLY STILL WRITING PYTHON PROGRAMS IN EITHER VIM OR DEDIT AND RUNNING THEM IN THE TERMINAL
I RECOMMEND STARTING OUT WITH AN IDE VIM AND SUBLIME TEXT ARE THE WAY TO GO PLUS YOU CAN LATER INSTALL PLUGGING TO TRANSFORM THESE EDITORS INTO A NICE PYTHON IDE
I DON'T THINK ANY LIST OF TECHNIQUES WOULD REALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION BECAUSE A JOB NORMALLY SPEAKS TO A PERIOD OF EXPERIENCE IN A LOW-LEVEL JOB

FOR A JOB YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN SOLVING REAL PROBLEMS WITH GOOD CODE KNOWING HOW AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN TO MAKE USE OF FUNCTOOLS OR GENERATORS ETC WILL COME OUT AS PART OF THAT EXPERIENCE
NEEDED KNOWLEDGE DEPENDS ON THE FIELD OF THE JOB YOU ARE LOOKING FOR

LOOKING FOR WEB PYTHON ENGINEERING THEN LEARN MAYBE

LOOKING FOR MID LEVEL DATA ANALYSIS JOB SNIPY STACK PLOTTING LIBRARIES SCRAPING MAYBE

AS U TICKETYWHO SAID THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THE TECHNIQUES AND SKILLS YOU LEARN DOING LOW-LEVEL JOBS I E WRITE CLEAN CODE UNDERSTAND OTHER PEOPLE'S CODE USE PYTHONIC PATTERNS ETC
NEAT
IT'S NOT IDEAL BUT FROM THEIR WEB PAGE

EXPECT ON WINDOWS

NEW IN VERSION WINDOWS SUPPORT

EXPECT CAN BE USED ON WINDOWS TO WAIT FOR A PATTERN TO BE PRODUCED BY A CHILD PROCESS USING EXPECT POPENSPAWN OR A FILE DESCRIPTOR USING THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED EXPERIMENTAL FOR NOW
I THINK YOU'RE DESCRIBING A CIRCULAR LINKED LIST IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AS DESCRIBED HERE YOU COULD WRITE A FUNCTION THAT GIVEN TWO NODES WOULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR VALUES




HOW ARE YOU GOING TO USE YOUR DATA STRUCTURE
YOU WANT A GRAPH LIBRARY NOT A GRAPHING LIBRARY NETWORK AND GRAPHVIZ ARE POPULAR OPTIONS BUT MAY BE OVERKILL DEPENDING ON YOUR NEEDS
FIRST THOUGHT IS WHILE IT CAN BE USED THERE MIGHT BE SOME BUILTIN EVEN CLOSER TO YOUR GOAL
TAKE A LOOK AT THE DEHUE THERE'S AN ARTICLE CIRCULAR BUFFERS IN PYTHON WHICH MIGHT HELP
I BELIEVE IT IS SIMPLY AN OPTION ON TO CONTINUE AFTER ENCOUNTERING AN ERROR
I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME COMMENTS OR REACTIONS FROM OTHER DATA SCIENTIST THAT HAVE USED THIS LIBRARY THIS LOOKS INTERESTING WHAT ARE THE OTHER SIMILAR PYTHON LIBRARIES OUT THERE THAT EITHER COMPLEMENT OR ATTEMPT TO DO MANY OF THE SAME THINGS LISTED HERE
GREAT WORK THIS LOOKS REALLY INTERESTING GIVEN THAT CRAB HAS BEEN ABANDONED ALMOST HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE RECASTS WITH OTHERS WHAT IS YOUR LONG TERM GOAL WITH IT
HI REDDIN I'M EXCITED TO SHARE FLINTLOCK WITH YOU AND TAKE YOUR COMMENTS QUESTIONS AND CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TROLLING IS OK TOO AS LONG AS IT'S FUNNY

FLINTLOCK IS MY FIRST SIGNIFICANT PYTHON PROJECT AS WELL AS MY FIRST OPEN SOURCE PROJECT THE READE IS PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE AND COVERS USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FEATURES INCLUDING A LAUNCH PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK VS 2 AS WELL AS MY MOTIVATION FOR STARTING THE PROJECT

INTERESTED CONTRIBUTORS SHOULD CHECK OUT THE CONTRIBUTING GUIDE AND IF YOU BEAR THE SCARS OF CONFIGURING SYSTEMS LIKE SPARK ON TOP OF THERE ARE SOME ISSUES I COULD USE YOUR HELP WITH

I'LL BE AROUND ON AND OFF TODAY TO RESPOND TO COMMENTS AND HELP PEOPLE GET SETUP WITH THE PROJECT I HOPE YOU LIKE IT

SO AM I MISSING SOMETHING OR IS THIS JUST A GIF WITH A TITLE LIKE THAT I EXPECTED TO LEARN SOMETHING
HI

THIS LOOKS VERY COOL TRY POSTING IN
FOR ANYONE WONDERING HERE IS SOME CODE OF THIS SEQUENCE UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T VERIFY THAT THIS IS THE CODE USED FOR GIF
WELL I AM A NEWBIE TO REDDIN WHEN I WAS POSTING THIS LINK YESTERDAY I GOT A HUMAN CHECKING AGAIN AND AGAIN SO I EVEN DID NOT KNOW THIS IMAGE WAS SUCCESSFULLY POSTED

HERE IS THE CODE IT USES RANDOM PARAMETERS AND RENDERS A DIFFERENT PATTERN EACH TIME YOU RUN IT JUST RUN


PYTHON


SOME MATH EXPLANATIONS

THE WAY IN THE PAGE CITED BY IS CALLED AND IT'S THE MOST COMMON WAY TO DRAW A PENROSE TILING USED BY ALMOST ALL CODES YOU CAN FIND ON INTERNET IT'S ELEMENTARY AND EASY TO IMPLEMENT BUT IT DOES NOT DRAW ALL PENROSE TILINGS

IN DE BRUIN FOUND A NEW WAY TO LOOK AT PENROSE TILINGS BY THE PENTAGRID METHOD HE CALLED HIS METHOD IS A BIT MATHEMATICALLY COMPLEXED BUT STILL NOT HARD TO IMPLEMENT INTO CODE A GOOD INTRODUCTORY LINK TO HIS METHOD IS HERE BUT YOU SHOULD REFER TO HIS ORIGINAL PAPER IF YOU WANT TO TRULY UNDERSTAND HIS METHOD
WOT THIS IS CLEARLY FROM JULY
PANDAS MAKES THIS REALLY EASY

IMPORT PANDAS AS PD

FILENAMES

RESULTS
FOR FILENAME IN FILENAMES
PD FILENAME

COMBINED RESULTS TRUE
COMBINED INDEX FALSE

OTHERWISE CHECK OUT THE XLSXWRITER HETP TUTORIAL BUT PANDAS JUST MAKES IT SO DARN SIMPLE
LWT TOGETHER WITH ITS ALARD COUNTER LIBRARY ARE VERY WELL KNOWN AND SUPPORTED LIBRARIES THAT READS AND WRITES THE EXCEL BINARY FORMATS
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT THE FILES BE LSB IT'S PRETTY EASY TO DO XLSX WITH PANDAS OR OPENPYXL BUT I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY LIBRARIES THAT CAN HANDLE LSB IN PYTHON
YOU COULD CONVERT THEM ALL TO XLSX USING OPENPYXL THEN MANUALLY SAVE EACH ONE AS AN LSB FILE FROM EXCEL

I'VE NEVER WORKED WITH AN LSB FILE BUT I IMAGINE IT'S FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD TO SAVE AS MANUALLY WHEN IT'S ONLY FILES

EN DEFAULT

I CAN WRITE OUT AN EXAMPLE IF THAT HELPS
YOU MIGHT GET MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON
WOW THIS IS REALLY REALLY NICE WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO ADD THE ABILITY TO WRITE TO AN IMAGE FILE INSTEAD OF A DRIVE KIND OF LIKE

DD IF DEV SDA OF BMG

THE GNU PARTED HYPERLINK IS BROKEN FYI
YOU SHOULDN'T HARDCORE EUDO IT'S NOT ALWAYS INSTALLED YOU SURE HAVE USERS EUDO YOUR COMMAND
SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THIS SCRIPT AUTOMATES THE DEPLOYMENT OF A DEDICATED TUNNEL USER GENERATES KEYS SETS UP AN OPENSSH SERVER WITH PERMITOPEN CONFIGURED TO BLOCK FREE TUNNELING ACCESS AND CONNECTS THE CLIENT I MISSED THE LINE WHERE YOU DISABLE SHELL ACCESS ON THE SERVER WITH A CUSTOM FORCECOMMAND OPTION BUT I BET IT'S THERE SOMEWHERE

INTERESTING IDEA BUT UNLESS YOU PLAN TO ADD SOME KIND OF GUI A SHELL SCRIPT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE IMHO
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE APPROACHING THIS WITH THE WRONG MINDSET IN MY EXPERIENCE THOSE WHO GET REALLY REALLY GOOD AT PROGRAMMING OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER ARE THOSE WHO DO IT BECAUSE THEY ENJOY IT FOR ITS OWN SAKE RATHER THAN SOME EXTERNAL GOAL SO NOT I WANT TO LEARN PROGRAMMING BECAUSE AUTONOMOUS CARS ARE COOL OR BECAUSE I HEAR THE PAY IS EPIC LEARN PROGRAMMING BECAUSE YOU ENJOY IT IN SOME WAY IF YOU DON'T ENJOY ANY OF IT THEN DON'T DO IT BECAUSE THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DO ENJOY IT AND THEY WILL INVARIABLY DO IT MUCH BETTER THAN YOU EVER WILL WITHOUT EVEN BATTING AN EYE NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE TALENTED BUT BECAUSE THEY ENJOY IT SO MUCH THAT THEY THINK ABOUT IT EVERY WAKING HOUR

I ALSO THINK THAT YOUR PROJECTS MAY BE TOO AMBITIOUS AT THIS STAGE AUTONOMOUS CARS ARE ONE OF CURRENT HARD PROBLEMS THEY INVOLVE ALL SORTS OF UNDECIDABLE PROBLEMS MACHINE LEARNING COMPUTER VISION AND A DOZEN OTHER REALLY COMPLEX AREAS

BUT REALLY FIX YOUR ATTITUDE YOU GETTING BORED IS NOT FAULT IT'S NOT FAULT EXCEPT YOUR OWN GETTING BORED MEANS YOU EITHER DON'T REALLY WANT IT OR YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND YOU SHOULD BE MORE ACTIVE ABOUT FINDING OUT WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO NOT DO IT WRONG
PROGRAMMING IS A MEANS TO AN END FINALLY CRACKING IT AND MAKING THAT THING YOU WANTED TO MAKE WORK IS AN AWESOME FEELING

YOU NEED TO PICK SMALLER PROJECTS IN THE BEGINNING THAT'S ALL
DIFFICULT SHIT IS DIFFICULT STOP GIVING UP YOU LAZY ASS
THANK YOU ALL FOR THE ADVICE I'LL TAKE THIS ALL INTO CONSIDERATION SO FAR IT SEEMS LIKE I JUST HAVE TO STICK TO IT TILL IT'S SEEMS EASIER AND FUN AGAIN AND I HAVE TO REALLY FORCE MYSELF TO GET INTO THANKS AGAIN EVERYONE
I AM CURRENTLY TEACHING MY SELF PYTHON AS WELL AND I HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS TO YOU FROM THE SOUNDS OF IT YOU MAY WANT TO GET EVALUATED FOR ADD I HAVE ADD I FIND THAT GETTING IN TO PYTHON WAS THE HARDEST PART FOR ME TOOK EVERY BIT OF WILLPOWER I HAD TO GET PAST THE BASICS HOWEVER ONCE I GOT TO A POINT THAT I COULD START WORKING ON SMALL PROJECTS I WAS ABLE TO STAY FOCUSED LONGER WITH OUT HELP SINCE IT WENT FROM BEING A CHORE TO SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY ENJOYED
OH SH T I POSTED IN THE WRONG SUBREDDIT SORRY FOLKS
EXECUTE LYNX DUMP OR BLINKS DUMP


BEAUTIFULSOUP AND FIND IMAGE LINKS
I'M IMPRESSED BY THE PLACE TAKEN FROM JAVA BY PYTHON
MY DURANGO PROJECT HAS SO MUCH JS LIBS IN IT THAT IT BECAME A JAVASCRIPT PROJECT ACCORDING TO GITHUB
WHAT'S THE FIRST ENGLISH LOL

EDIT PLEASE DONT CRUCIFY ME
AND AGAIN THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T FILTER OUT THE COUNTLESS PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN SOME LANGUAGE OTHER THAN JS BUT SHIP WITH A WHOLE LOT JS LIBRARIES
THIS IS VERY COOL BUT OF COURSE IT CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF APPLICATIONS LOCKED AWAY IN ENTERPRISE REPOSITORIES I'D GUESS THAT JAVA AND MAYBE C WOULD BE ON TOP IF YOU COULD COUNT THEM TOO
SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF DISTORTED DATA CAUSED BY HACKTOBERFEST IMPRESSIVE BUT I WOULDN'T READ INTO IT TOO MUCH
TITLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE'S JAVASCRIPT AND THEN THERE'S EVERYTHING ELSE
I'M SURPRISED C HAS MORE THAN RUBY THAT'S COOL THAT PYTHON IS 2 I DON'T THINK I GUESSED THAT EITHER I PROBABLY GUESSED JAVASCRIPT AND RUBY 2
PYTHON WILL GO TO THE 1ST PLACE IF COULD REPLACE SAP ORACLE STUFFS BY DOO ALTERNATIVES ENTERPRISE ERP SOLUTIONS
NIOBE HAS MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF LANGUAGE POPULARITY
I'VE READ IT PYTHON 2 MOST POPULAR LANGUAGE NOT SO FAR FROM TRUE
THIS SUB IS PRETTY QUIET FOR HOW POPULAR WE ARE
COMPLETE GUESS BUT THERE IS SUPPORT IN QT FOR HIGH RESOLUTION SCREEN SCALING DESCRIBED HERE WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR USING THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DESCRIBED THERE
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE ADVICE AT R LEARNPYTHON
AUTOMATE MORE TASKS TACKLE PROJECTS THAT YOU'D TRADITIONALLY USE OTHER TOOLS LIKE MAYBE EXCEL WITH A PYTHON NOTEBOOK OR SCRIPTURE OPPORTUNITIES WILL PRESENT THEMSELVES AS YOU CONTINUE TO WORK AND YOU'LL CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE

IT'S THAT SIMPLE
WHAT ABOUT COOKIES USER AGENTS AND AUTHENTICATION
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE A NETWORKING GUY I'M NO PYTHON EXPERT BUT THE OBVIOUS THING TO ME IS TO TAKE STOCK OF ALL THE STUFF YOU DO DAY-TO-DAY OR AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK OR WHATEVER AT WORK AND JUST AUTOMATE THAT OUT OF YOUR LIFE THATS HOW I'M LEARNING AT LEAST GL
IN ORDER TO SOLIDIFY MY KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS WITH A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE I ALWAYS MAKE AN IRC BOTANY THE DUTIES OF THE BOT CHANGE FROM IMPLEMENTATION TO IMPLEMENTATION BUT THEY ALL COMMUNICATE WITH AN IRC CHANNEL USER AND WELL SOMETHING ELSE
I HAVE ALSO THOUGHT A GOOD WORK RELATED PROJECT WOULD BE TO GRAB A BACKUP FROM A SONIC WALL CONFIT FILE AND WRITE A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT EXPORTS IT TO A READABLE TXT FILE

WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT GIVE IT A SHOT AND ASK QUESTIONS IN R LEARNPYTHON IF YOU GET STUCK IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO WORK ON A PROJECT THAT SOLVES A PROBLEM FOR YOUR WORK OR IS FUN FOR YOU PERSONALLY RATHER THAN DO AN EXERCISE YOU ARE MUCH MORE MOTIVATED THAT WAY AND WHEN YOU ARE DONE IT IS MORE SATISFYING
I WOULD SUGGEST DOING THE WORK RELATED PROJECT
I FOUND I LEARN BEST WHEN I WORK ON STUFF THAT IS EITHER FUN OR I CAN USE FOR WORK

WHEN I FIRST STARTED LEARNING PYTHON MY WORK DIDN'T HAVE ANY BACKUPS OF OUR NETWORK CONFIGURATIONS SO WHEN I DEVICE WENT BAD WE JUST HAD TO RECONFIDE IT FROM SCRATCH AND HOPEFULLY MAKE IT THE SAME BAD

SO THE FIRST PROJECT I WROTE WAS ONE THAT WENT THROUGH ALL NETWORK DEVICES AND COPIED THEIR CONFIT TO A TEXT FILE VERSIONER IT AND KEPT A NEW ONE IF IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST ONE IT WAS FUN TO LEARN PARAMIKO TSH LIB AND HOW TO WRITE TO FILES AND COMPARE THEM MAYBE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING SIMILAR
I THINK A GOOD GENERAL BEGINNER PROJECT IS TO MAKE TELEGRAM BOT WHICH IS A CHAT BOT THAT IS BUILT ON THE TELEGRAM MESSAGING APP PLATFORM IT'S FUN NOT TOO DIFFICULT AND YOU CAN DEMO THE CHAT BOT TO PEOPLE YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE BOT THAT I MADE WHILE LEARNING PYTHON AT

OFFICIAL TELEGRAM BOT API
BOTS

PYTHON API WRAPPER
EN LATEST

DIRECTORY OF TELEGRAM BOTS TO GIVE YOU INSPIRATION

I PREFER CONDA FOR THIS
THANKS FOR SHARING I AM REALLY STRUGGLING WITH GETTING MY ENVIRONMENT THE WAY I WANT IT SEEMS SOME THINGS ON MY DEVELOPMENT BOX DEFAULT TO PYTHON 2 WHILE OTHERS PYTHON MY JUPITER NOTEBOOK IS A COMPLETE MESS IT RUNS PYTHON 2 BY DEFAULT BUT PYTHON WON'T IMPORT PROPERLY I'VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON STACK OVERFLOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON
THIS IS THE EXACT PROBLEM THAT ANACONDA WAS CREATED FOR AS A DATA SCIENTIST I LOVE THE SIMPLICITY OF MANAGING MY ENVIRONMENTS AND NOT HAVING TO CONFIGURE PYTHON BUMPY ETC
I'M ON PAYEN AND I'VE SWITCHED OVER TO VEX I'VE FOUND THINGS TO BE MUCH MORE TOLERABLE SIMILAR TO THE REST OF THE BASH ENVIRONMENT

AND FOR THE MOST PART NOW THAT I USE VEX EXCLUSIVELY I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY NECESSITY OF INSTALLING SYSTEM LEVEL PACKAGES EXCEPT

PIP
VEX

AND I INSTALL A COUPLE OF LINTERS FOR MY TEXT EDITOR EVERYTHING ELSE LIVES INSIDE OF A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
SERIOUSLY WHERE IS CONDA
WHAT ABOUT THE PYTHON PACKAGED PYVENV
OH MY GOD THIS IS INCREDIBLE

I'M THE AUTHOR OF PYAUTOGUI WHICH LETS YOU CONTROL THE KEYBOARD MOUSE

BEING ABLE TO REGISTER GLOBAL HOCKEYS AND HAVE A RECORDING ABILITY TO SPEED UP MAKING THESE MACROS HAS BEEN ON THE ROADMAN FOR A QUITE A WHILE BUT I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO IMPLEMENT THEM I WOULD LOVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROJECT AND INCORPORATE IT INTO PYAUTOGUI AS WELL

MAKING IT WORK ON ALL OSES AND PYTHON 2 IS STRATEGICALLY BRILLIANT
AUTHOR HERE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR RECEIVE FEEDBACK

THERE ARE OTHER SIMILAR LIBRARIES OUT THERE BUT THEY USUALLY

HAVE MANY DEPENDENCIES REQUIRING ADMIN RIGHTS OR HEADACHES TO INSTALL
INCLUDE C MODULES THAT REQUIRE A COMPILER
ARE
ONLY WORK WITH AMERICAN KEYBOARDS
OR IMPLEMENT EITHER HOOKS OR MACROS NOT BOTH

SO I TOOK MATTERS INTO MY OWN HANDS AND IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY YOU'LL ALSO SEE A MOUSE SUBMODULE THAT IS IN DEVELOPMENT BUT FULLY FUNCTIONAL
AWESOME ANY PLANS TO SUPPORT OS X OR ANY WAY WE CAN HELP SUPPORT OS X
PLANNING TO USE THIS SOON
CAN THIS LIBRARY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT KEYBOARDS I'M USING A USB NUMERIC KEYBOARD TO TRIGGER CERTAIN MACROS AT WORK BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PYTHON LIBRARIES THAT CAN HOOK INTO KEYSTROKES FROM ONLY ONE DEVICE
INTERESTING PROJECT THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS

DO YOU THINK THIS SOFTWARE IS FAST ENOUGH NOT TO CAUSE INPUT LAG FOR FAST TYPISTS
I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU NEED X RUNNING TO USE IT WHILE TAKING A QUICK GLANCE AT YOUR SOURCE CODE FLAKE REPORTED SEVERAL UNUSED IMPORTS I ALSO NOTICED USE OF LISTS FOR STATIC SEQUENCED DATA HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO OPTIMIZATION AT THIS POINT

ALSO DO YOU EXPECT USERS TO EUDO PIP INSTALL THIS SOFTWARE I'VE READ THAT IT IS COMMONLY REGARDED AS POOR PRACTICE TO EUDO PIP INSTALL SOFTWARE FOR TWO REASONS

THE INSTALLED FILES MIGHT CONFLICT WITH OTHER OS INSTALLED PYTHON FILES
2 PRIVILEGED EXECUTION OF UNTRUSTED CODE

YOUR SOURCE CODE IS AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE TO READ BUT PERHAPS EVERYBODY TRUSTS IT WITHOUT CHECKING THINKING IT'S OSS SO SOMEONE MUST HAVE AUDITED IT

I HOPE I DON'T SOUND OFF-CUTTING I LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE I'M JUST TRYING TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WHEN TRYING TO INSTALL AND USE YOUR SOFTWARE AND HOPE YOU WILL BENEFIT FROM THE FEEDBACK

ANYONE CARE TO SHARE WHAT THEY WOULD USE THIS LIBRARY FOR THE OBVIOUS KEYLOGGER IS ADVISED AGAINST IN THE READE
THIS IS REALLY DOPE I WROTE A LITTLE MODULE AT WORK FOR AUTOMATING SOME MUNDANE TASKS AND I USED SENDKEYS WITH WIN BUT THE PRESS AND RELEASE METHOD LOOKS MUCH CLEANER
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO USE THIS LIBRARY TO IMPLEMENT

CURRENTLY I'M USING AUTOHOTKEY WITH BUT I OFTEN GET STUCK KEYS WITH IT
HI I HAVE A SIMILAR LIBRARY WHICH I MAINTAIN HERE

I WROTE IT PARTIALLY TO LEARN HOW WINDOWS DOES HOOKS THEN PEOPLE STARTED TO WANT TO USE IT

I AM THINKING OF SLOWLY DEPRECATING IT AS I THINK YOUR LIBRARY IS BETTER AND MORE FEATURE COMPLETE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I DON'T WANT TO COMPETE DIVIDE USER BASES

I WILL PROBABLY DO SO SLOWLY AS THE APIS AREN'T THE MOST SIMILAR SO I WILL START BY REDIRECTING NEW USERS TO YOUR LIBRARY AND THEN IN OH MONTHS END SUPPORT FOR MY LIBRARY FYI

ALSO GREAT WORK ON THE LIBRARY
GOOD LUCK I WORKED HEAVILY ON PYUSERINPUT AND THEY HAVE HIT A BIT OF A BRICK WALL WITH THE MAC STUFF ITS NOT EASY I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SOLVE THIS WITHOUT USING THE C EXTENSIONS I'D LIKE TO BE WRONG BUT ITS HARD THIS IS MY FORK IF ITS ANY HELP
REQUIRES ROOT ON LINUX

BUT WHY THIS IMMEDIATELY MAKES LIB SO MUCH LESS USEFUL HERE IS SOLUTION I MADE AND IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ROOT
I WANT TO WRITE A PYTHON SCRIPT TO ADD A FEW GLOBAL HOCKEYS I DID THE FOLLOWING TO KEEP THE PYTHON PROCESS OPEN AND LISTENING FOR EVENTS BUT I IMAGINE THERE SHOULD BE A MORE ELEGANT SOLUTION WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING INSTEAD

KEYBOARD
WHILE TRUE

I'VE NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE ADVANTAGE OF USING MAKE OVER JUST USING PYTHON IF YOU'RE CREATING A PYTHON PACKAGE YOU ARE ASSURED TO HAVE PYTHON WHY LIMIT TO SAY MAC LINUX IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A FULL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TO HANDLE THE SAME TASK

I WILL USE CAKE FOR C EXTENSIONS BUT I'D LIKELY NOT USE ANYTHING BUT PYTHON FOR OTHER TASKS
TRY R LEARNPYTHON
2 TRY FLASK
SETUP IS KIND OF ANNOYING WHEN YOU FIRST GET GOING WITH ASYNCIO THERE IS A BIT OF CEREMONY WITH BEING A COROUTINE THOUGH IT DOES MAKE SENSE ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS GIVE A COROUTINE NATIVE GENERATOR INSTEAD OF THE SERVER OBJECT

IT'S COMMON IN ASYNCIO TO

LOOP ASYNCIO
SR LOOP
TRY
LOOP
EXCEPT KEYBOARDINTERRUPT
PASS
FINALLY

LOOP SR


THERE ISN'T REALLY A GREAT WAY TO GET AROUND IT AND YOU CANNOT CREATE IT BEFORE THE LOOP EXISTS SINCE IT EFFECTIVELY BINDS THE LOOP TO A SOCKET AND SYSTEM EVENTS

ONE OPTION IS TO USE A COROUTINE FOR YOUR SETUP SINCE IN MANY CASES YOU MAY USE OTHER COROUTINE BASED INITIALIZERS BUT IT'S A CASE BY CASE BASIS

I THINK YOU SHOULD USE INSTEAD LOOK AT THE ECHO SERVER EXAMPLE
BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE CHOICES YOU MAKE IF YOU DEVELOP ANYTHING DURING TIME YOU'RE AT WORK AND OR ON A COMPANY MACHINE THE COMPANY IS PROBABLY IN A GOOD PLACE TO SUE YOU TO CLAIM OWNERSHIP OVER YOUR WORK IF THEY WERE TO WANT TO DO THAT IN THE FUTURE YOU MIGHT BE FINE BUT YOU KNOW THAT BEST PROBABLY PERSONALLY I AM HOURLY AS A CONSULTANT SO IF I WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE I LOCK MY WORK MACHINE RECORD THE TIME AND I DON'T BILL MY EMPLOYER FOR THE TIME I SPEND ON MY PROJECT IF YOU ARE WORKING ON SOMETHING OF TRIVIAL IMPORTANCE THAT YOU WOULDN'T MIND LOSING THEN THERE IS A CHANCE YOUR COMPANY WOULDN'T BOTHER TO PURSUE LEGAL REMEDIES AGAINST YOU LATER SELLING THE SOFTWARE BUT MENTIONING MONEY LEADS ME TO BELIEVE IT IS

ALL THAT SAID ONE APPROACH THAT MIGHT MAKE YOUR WORK HARDER TO NOTICE WOULD BE TO USE TEAM VIEWER OR ANOTHER REMOTE DESKTOP APP TO WORK ON YOUR HOME MACHINE REMOTELY IF YOU'RE WORKING REMOTE LEAVING NO TRACE ON YOUR HARD-DRIVEN AT WORK AND YOU DON'T HAVE A PUBLICLY VIEWABLE REPOSITORY SHOWING TIMESTAMPS THEN IT WOULD BE FAIRLY DIFFICULT FOR AN EMPLOYER TO BUILD A REASONABLE CASE AGAINST YOU
THINK I MAY HAVE JUST ANSWERED MY OWN QUESTION WINPYTHON SEEMS LIKE IT MAY WORK I'LL LET YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I THINK AFTER I USE IT
MAY BE AN OPTION IT'S A BIT LIMITED THOUGH
ANACONDA
THE LINE ABOUT IT NOT BEING SECURE ENOUGH FOR USE IN PRODUCTION SHOULD BE BEFORE THE TUTORIAL RATHER THAN AFTER
ONE THING BAFFLES ME WHY DOES HE STORE PIP ARTIFACTS INSIDE REPO
I AM NOT SURE IF THIS COUNTS BUT I USUALLY WRITE THE DOCUMENTATION FIRST INPUTS OPTIONS OUTPUTS KNOWN ISSUES ETC THEN I WRITE OUT THE CODE
YOU'RE CORRECT THAT MAKING A FUNCTION FOR ADDING IS SILLY BUT FOR LITERALLY ANYTHING MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT PUTTING ARGUMENT PARSING AND THE WORK YOU WANT TO DO ON THE ARGUMENTS IN DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IS SOLID PROGRAM DESIGN

AS A GUIDELINE CONSIDER THAT YOU SHOULD BE SUSPICIOUS OF FUNCTIONS THAT GROW OVER LINES AND IF THE FUNCTION GETS GREATER THAN LINES LONG IT'S WORTH BREAKING IT INTO SEPARATE RESPONSIBILITIES IN ORDER TO TEST IT EFFECTIVELY

IF THIS IS SLOWING YOU DOWN YOU SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT PARTS OF YOUR TOOLCHAIN MAKE FILE MANAGEMENT DIFFICULT OR MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DIG INTO DATA MOST IDES HAVE TOOLS THAT CAN FIND DEPENDENCIES FOR YOU VIM AND EMACS HAVE CLAGS ETC
I ALWAYS MAKE SOMETHING CONFIGURABLE USING ARGPARSE EVEN IF IT'S A ONE-OFF AND I COULD JUST AS WELL HARDCORE A CONSTANT
THE OBVIOUS ANSWER FOR ME IS IT DEPENDS YOUR EXAMPLE IS A LITTLE TOO SIMPLE BECAUSE OF THE ADD OPERATION THAT IT SEEMS POINTLESS IN MOST OTHER CASES I WOULD SAY YOU ARE PROBABLY JUST PROPERLY SEPARATING YOUR CODE IN TO FUNCTIONS

HOWEVER IN MY OPINION SEPARATING THIS IN TO TWO MODULES IS MAJOR OVERKILL THERE IS NO REASON YOU CAN'T HAVE A IF BLOCK AT THE END OF PY I WRITE MOST OF MY CODE AS A LIBRARY LIKE YOU SAY AND TYPICALLY HAVE A COMMAND LINE INTERFACE VIA IF FOR TESTING AND DEBUGGING AT THE VERY LEAST IF THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE CODE IS FOR ONE SINGLE ENTRY POINT BY THE USER THEN I MIGHT PUT THIS IN MYPKG PY SO IT CAN BE CALLED AS PYTHON M MYPKG TO SIMPLIFY IT A LITTLE

EDIT MAYBE SHOULD HAVE NOTED THAT I CALL THE INDIVIDUAL SCRIPTS LIKE PYTHON M MYPKG
WHEN YOU SAY LIBRARY I THINK THE TERM YOU MAY HAVE MEANT TO USE WOULD BE MODULE AS A MODULE YES I DO THAT TOO ALWAYS A FOLDER FOR THE REPO CONTAINING A FOLDER FOR AN PY ALONGSIDE A THE BASIC SCAFFOLDING IS NOT SO BASIC ANYMORE
MAKE IT WORK MAKE IT RIGHT MAKE IT FAST THAT'S THE ORDER SO OPTION

YOU SHOULD USE AN EDITOR THAT MAKES REFRACTURING A KEYSTROKE AWAY SO IT'S NOT A TRADE OFF JUST THE ORDER
SO WHICH SHOULD I BE DOING OPTION OR OPTION 2

IMO THE QUESTION SHOULD ALWAYS BE DOES THE COMPLEXITY OF WRITING A SEPARATE MODULE OUTWEIGH THE COMPLEXITY OF LEAVING THE CODE IN A SINGLE FILE

IF YOU SEPARATE CODE INTO SEPARATE FILES YOU DEPLOYMENT COMPLEXITY YOU WILL NEED TO DEAL WITH PATHS POSSIBLY WITH INSTALLERS ETC ETC IF YOU KEEP EVERYTHING IN ONE FILE YOU CAN SIDE-STEP ALL OF THAT

IF YOU DECIDE THAT THE CODE YOU HAVE REALLY SHOULD BE SEPARATED THEN YOU SHOULD DO IT CREATE AN INSTALLABLE MODULE MAKE YOUR SCRIPT THE ONLY EXPORT FUNCTIONS FROM THE MODULE THAT ARE NEEDED ETC

WHILE IT MAKES MY CODE REUSABLE IT ALSO SLOWS ME DOWN AND INTRODUCES MORE COMPLEXITY

THAT REALLY IS THE POINT ALL THE TIME I SEE SMALL AMOUNTS OF CODE THAT ARE SEPARATED INTO MODULES BUT ARE REUSED IN THOSE CASES YOU BASICALLY GAIN NOTHING BY THE INCREASED FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT ANYWAY

THERE REALLY ISN'T A FINAL ANSWER OPTION IS SOMETIMES BETTER AND OPTION 2 IS SOMETIMES BETTER
SO ITS AND BECAUSE AAAS IS AWESOME SLACK IS NOW THING
ERGO LETS REINVENT THE WHEEL CAUSE BOTS ARE NOW ALLOWED BY THE GENEROUS WALLED GARDENERS OF SAID AAAS ENVIRONMENT

WHILE I ADMIRE ANYONE WORKING ON SMALL PROJECTS LIKE THIS I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT TEXT BASED GROUP CHAT IS THE NEW CORPORATE TOOL ANNO AND ON TOP OF THAT BEING ALLOWED TO RUN BOTS IS THE NEW COOL FEATURE THOSE PLATFORMS COME UP WITH

I CAN GUESS WHY THOUGH AS DESIGNING FOR A SCREEN IS GETTING MORE AND MORE IRRELEVANT WITH ASSISTANTS THE WHOLE MOVE INTO APPS AND MEDIA RICH WEBSITES HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE OF A SIDESTEP EVERYONE EVENTUALLY NEEDS TO STEER AWAY FROM AGAIN

LETS SEE IF OPEN DATA WITH STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS ALSO MAKE A COMEBACK OR IF EVERYONE ENDS UP HAVING TO PAY PRAY TO THE GODS OF VOICE COMMAND AMAZON'S ECHO GOOGLE AND APPLE'S SIRI TO GET INCLUDED IN THE PLATFORM LIKE WE SAW WITH THE WHOLE WALLED GARDEN APPROACH TO APPS INSTEAD OF RESPONSIVE WEBSITES
IMPORT ONLY WORKS FOR BUILT-IN CORPORA IF YOU WANT TO USE YOUR OWN FILES USE PLAINTEXTCORPUSREADER METHOD SEE THE DETAILS IN THE NOLT TUTORIAL
THE EASIEST WAY TO FIND THAT NRL WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LOOK IN YOUR NETWORK PROFILER AS THE PAGE LOADS JUST LOOK THROUGH THE FILES FOR FILENAMES OR CONTENT THAT LOOK INTERESTING

IF YOU WANTED TO AUTOMATE THIS PROGRAMMATICALLY TO FIND UNPUBLISHED APIS I WOULD SAY YOU'D COVER A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF CASES BY SIMPLY SPIDERLING PAGES AND CHECKING IF THEY CONTAIN VALID JASON YOU COULD ALSO TRY CHECKING FOR REQUESTS TO PAGES THAT CONTAIN STRINGS LIKE JASON AND API OR IN THE RESPONSE HEADER
IN CHROME CTRL SHIFT I THEN NETWORK TAB THEN LOOK AT THE INITIATOR FOR THE IT'S WHICH IS MAKING THE CALL WHICH IS A LITTLE MORE TRICKY

TO AUTOMATE THIS SEARCH YOU WOULD NEED TO RUN A FULL BROWSER YOU CAN ACTUALLY RUN CHROME PROGRAMMATICALLY AS TO WHETHER YOU CAN AUTOMATE THE SEARCH FOR THESE I DOUBT IT

YOU COULD PROBABLY INSPECT THE RESPONSE FROM EVERY REQUEST ON A PAGE AND SCAN FOR CERTAIN BITS OF TEXT
A GOOD API USUALLY RETURNS THE NEXT BURLS TO USE

DATA SOMETHING NEXT NRL
IF YOU FIND A BUG THAT YOU CAN'T IMMEDIATELY FIX IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO WRITE A TEST TO REPRODUCE IT THEN MARK IT AS AN EXPECTED FAILURE WHEN YOU DO GET AROUND TO FIXING IT YOU CAN REMOVE THE DECORATOR IF THE BUG IS EVER ACCIDENTALLY FIXED THE TEST WILL SHOW UP AS AN UNEXPECTED SUCCESS AND YOU CAN WORK OUT WHAT YOU CHANGED THAT FIXED IT
I WOULD SAY IT IS POOR PRACTICE AS YOU POINT OUT LATER IF YOU ARE TESTING THAT A PATHOLOGICAL CONDITION CORRECTLY PRODUCES THE WRONG ANSWER THEN THERE SHOULD GENERALLY BE AN EXCEPTION OR SOME OTHER WAY OF HANDLING FAILURE SO THAT THE TEST PASSES GETTING INTO THE HABIT OF EXPECTING FAILED TESTS EVEN IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP AS FAILED IS NOT A GOOD IDEA
I'VE NOTICED IT BEING USED IN SITUATIONS WHERE A TEST FAILS ON PARTICULAR PLATFORMS BECAUSE OF AN AWKWARD BUG THAT NOBODY WANTS TO FIX SKIPPING THE TEST ARGUABLY ISN'T APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THE TEST IS SUPPOSED TO PASS AND IT'S HANDY TO HAVE THE REMINDER THERE
GENERALLY SPEAKING YOU WANT TO USE THIS WHEN YOU HAVE CODE THAT MUST RAISE A CERTAIN EXCEPTION UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS VERIFYING THAT YOUR CODE FAILS WHEN YOU EXPECT IT TO FAIL IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS CHECKING THE HAPPY CASE IF NOT MORE

AN EXAMPLE WHERE THIS KIND OF TEST CAN BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS WHEN YOU'RE WRITING AUTHENTICATION AUTHORIZATION CODE SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A FUNCTION CREATEUSER WHICH REQUIRES ADMIN PERMISSION YOU WOULD WANT TO WRITE AT LEAST TWO TESTS TO ACCURATELY COVER THIS BEHAVIOR ONE A TEST THAT CALLS THE FUNCTION WITH A CURRENT USER WHO IS AN ADMINISTRATOR AND TWO A TEST THAT CALLS IT WITH A CURRENT USER WHO ISN'T IN THE FIRST CASE YOU WANT TO VERIFY THAT THE CALL GOES THROUGH IN THE SECOND CASE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT RAISES THE RIGHT KIND OF EXCEPTION

OF COURSE YOU COULD REWRITE THE TEST TO CATCH THE EXCEPTION RETURN TRUE IN THE EXCEPT BRANCH AND FALSE IN THE TRY BODY BUT THAT GETS OLD QUICK AND INTRODUCES A LOT OF BOILERPLATE
IS BETTER
I'M AFRAID THAT I CANNOT WORK OUT WHAT THAT CODE IS SUPPOSED TO DO

THIS IS A GOOD PLACE FOR BASIC DATA ANALYSIS USING PYTHON
ALSO ARE THERE ANY MODULES FOR DRAWING FIGURES MATALAN THANKS SO MUCH IN ADVANCE

YES THERE'S A FEW OPTIONS BUT THE MAIN ONE IS MATPLOTLIB I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEABORN TOO AS IT EXTENDS MATPLOTLIB WITH A LOT OF USEFUL PLOTTING FUNCTIONS AND NICE COLOUR SCHEMES

I'M A BIOLOGIST NEUROSCIENCE AND I DO ALL MY WORK WITH JUPITER BUMPY SNIPY PANDAS MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN IT'S A GREAT COMBINATION

HOWEVER DON'T DISCOUNT ROYAL IT'S A SOMEWHAT CLUMSY LANGUAGE ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO PYTHON BUT IT HAS BIOINFORMATICS LIBRARIES THAT DON'T EXIST ON PYTHON I USE IT FOR MY ANALYSIS AGAIN USING JUPITER I DON'T USE ANY OTHER IDES ANYMORE
AFTER BASICS AFTER BASICS AFTER BASICS IMPORTANT SO SAY IT TIMES YOU CAN CHECK LIBRARIES LIKE PMC 2 PMC THESE ARE VERY GOOD FOR BIOINFORMATICS
A FUN PLAYGROUND TO TRY IS PROJECT ROSALIND HETP

THERE ARE A BUNCH OF BIOINFORMATICS PROBLEMS TO SOLVE IF YOU TRY ANSWERING THEM IN PYTHON YOU'LL PROBABLY IDENTIFY LANGUAGE FEATURES QUIRKS THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE
CHECK OUT BIOPYTHON
FOR CORE PYTHON JUST USE THE OFFICIAL TUTORIAL
IF I WERE YOU I MIGHT JUST LEARN PYTHON BY USING IT

A PYTHON FRAMEWORK FOR THE ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION OF TREES


BIOPYTHON TUTORIAL AND COOKBOOK


A PYTHON PACKAGE FOR PRECISION MEDICINE AND PROTEOGENOMICS


IN THE BIBLE PSALMS MY BACKGROUND IS THE SAME AS YOURS DUAL MASTER OF SCIENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING I LEFT BIO FIELD YEARS AGO AFTER I DID MICROARRAY GENECHIP RESEARCH
ALSO THERE IS ORANGE A NICE BIOINFORMATICS WRAPPER AROUND IF YOU WANT TO MIX DATA SCIENCE AND BIOLOGY



THIS ISN'T BIOINFORMATICS SPECIFIC BUT I'M A COMPUTATIONAL CHEMIST IN A PHD PROGRAM AND I'VE PRETTY MUCH JUST USED A COMBINATION OF BUMPY SNIPY AND MATPLOTLIB FOR ALL MY DATA ANALYSIS

I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU THOUGH I THINK BIOINFORMATICS COULD BE A FIELD WHERE I COULD UTILIZE THE SKILLS I PICKED UP AS A PHD STUDENT IN ENZYME DESIGN DO YOU HAVE ANY GOOD RESOURCES ON SOME GOOD BIOSTATISTICS MATERIAL THAT MIGHT BE INDUSTRIALLY RELEVANT I'M A PHYSICAL CHEMIST BY TRAINING SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE TO LOOK
THANKS I'VE ONLY BEEN USING A TINY SUBSET OF CAPABILITIES AND DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT
EVEN BETTER THAN ADB SEE IADB
THANKS I'VE NEVER HAD DEBUGGING CAPABILITIES IN MY CODE BEFORE
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NICE TO KNOW ADB BUT FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE INTUITIVE I'VE FOUND THAT VISUAL STUDIO CODE WITH THE PYTHON EXTENSION IS THE MOST LIGHTWEIGHT OPTION WITH A DECENT DEBUGGING EXPERIENCE

UNLIKE PYCHARM FOR EXAMPLE IT STILL FEELS AND RUNS LIKE A TEXT EDITOR DESPITE ALL OF THE FEATURES TYPICALLY FOUND IN IDES
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT BUT I OFTEN JUST SET THE CONDITIONAL BREAK POINT RIGHT IN MY CODE

IF

JUST BECAUSE TYPING IN THE EDITOR IS EASIER
COULD YOU CLARIFY A BIT WHAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF YOUR DESIRED FINAL RESULT LOOKS LIKE ALONG WITH SOME SPECIFICS REGARDING THE SCALE OF THE PROJECT ARE YOU EXPECTING ONES TENS HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF CLIENT CONNECTIONS PER SECOND IS THERE A JASON FILE PER CLIENT OR ARE THEY ALL TRYING TO ACCESS THE SAME FILE WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF SENDING RECEIVING TO THE SAME FILE HOW DOES THE SCRIPT KNOW WHICH PORTIONS OF THE JASON FILE TO SEND BACK TO THE CLIENTS ONCE IT HAS WRITTEN DATA WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

I'D LOVE TO HELP BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO OR WHY
YOU MIGHT HAVE BETTER LUCK USING A STANDARD WEBSOCKET LIBRARY IN PYTHON SO PYTHON WOULD DO EVERYTHING YOUR PYTHON SCRIPT WOULD REPLACE YOUR WEBSOCKETD SERVER AND THAT WAY YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO THE PYTHON INTERPRETER EVERY TIME A WEBSOCKET CONNECTION WAS MADE AND THE JASON DATA WOULD NEVER HAVE TO BE WRITTEN TO A FILE THAT SHOULD REDUCE YOUR RESOURCE USAGE CONSIDERABLY
THE PERL FOUNDATION HAS A PERL CORE MAINTENANCE FUND THAT'S USED FOR GRANTS TO FUND TASKS OR PROJECTS RELATED TO PERL

THE PSF HAS GIVEN GRANTS IN THE PAST FOR CORE PROJECTS THOUGH THERE ISN'T A DEDICATED FUND IT JUST COMES FROM GENERAL RESERVES MAYBE THE PSF SHOULD SET A TARGET OF X YEAR TO FUND OR 2 PEOPLE AND THEN TRY EITHER CROWDFUNDING IT OR FINDING CORPORATE SPONSORS TO MEET THE NECESSARY GOAL

HEY I JUST LISTENED TO THIS TODAY THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST BORING EPISODE AND IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST EPISODE OF TALK PYTHON TO ME I SUGGEST MAYBE CHECKING OUT ANOTHER EPISODE FIRST BEFORE PASSING JUDGEMENT EVEN STILL THIS IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING MORE ABOUT HOW THE COMMUNITY IS STRUCTURED AND FUNDED ABOUT AS INTERESTING AS A CITY COUNCIL MEETING BUT VERY RELEVANT
IS THERE AN ETA FOR A INCREMENTAL PIPY RELEASE THE RELEASE WOULD WORK FOR ME EXCEPT FOR THE ABSENCE OF SCANDIA WHICH CAN'T BE PIP INSTALLED IN PIPY
PYTHON 2 BECAUSE HE STATES THAT PYTHON HASN'T PRETTY MUCH TAKEN OFF YET

THAT STATEMENT IS JUST WRONG
ITEM ID

IT'S NOT A WASTE NO BUT IT MAY BE HELPFUL TO LOOK INTO MAKING THE PYTHON 2 CODE YOU WRITE COMPATIBLE WITH PYTHON FROM THE I HAVE WRITTEN A LOT OF COMPATIBLE CODE AND I HAVE UPGRADED A FAIR BIT OF PYTHON 2 CODE TO BE COMPATIBLE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO DO IT FROM THE BEGINNING THIS WEBSITE HAS A LOT OF GREAT ADVICE ON DOING JUST THAT
TIME SPENT LEARNING IS NEVER TIME WASTED

YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE TO JUST FINE IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL FINISH THE LESSONS YOU'RE WORKING ON THEN INSTALL VERSION AND WORK OUT THE KINKS WHEN WORKING ON YOUR PROJECTS WHEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN HOW YOU LEARNED WITH 2 IT WON'T TAKE YOU LONG

IS WHERE IT'S AT NOW
2 MOVED TO COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND NEVER LOOKED BACK I'D RECOMMEND AUTOMATING THE BORING STUFF OVER LPTHW
MY 2 CENTS IS THAT YOU SHOULD LEARN AND JUST BRIEFLY FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE DIFFERENCE IN 2 FOR ME I'VE ONLY EXPERIENCED CONFLICTS DUE TO PRINT AND CHANGES TO THE WAY STRINGS ARE HANDLED
ANY LEARNING IS GOOD LEARNING BUT I FIND THE SNIDE TONE AND CLEAR BIAS AGAINST PYTHON IN LPTHW TO BE PRETTY DEMORALISING

THAT SAID YOU WON'T HAVE A HARD TIME MIGRATING THE NECESSARY SYNTAX CHANGES AREN'T MASSIVE ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE STRING LOGIC IS

WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR CURRENT TOPIC WHY NOT SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A TUTORIAL THAT RUNS OVER ALL THE NEW STUFF

NAH ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT AND 2 IS STILL MUCH MORE WIDELY DEPLOYED YOU CAN LEARN MOST OF THE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN A DAY ALSO THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO NOW TO HELP YOUR 2 CODE BE UPWARDLY COMPATIBLE WITH CODE
THIS MAY BE AN UNPOPULAR OPINION BUT FROM EXPERIENCE I CAN TELL YOU THAT DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO LEARNING PYTHON 2 MIGHT MAKE YOU MORE PRODUCTIVE FASTER THE REASON I CHOSE PYTHON WAS TO BE ABLE TO WRITE COMPUTER SECURITY TOOLS MOST BOOKS ON THAT I KNOW ARE STILL WRITTEN IN PYTHON 2 I THINK IT'S BECAUSE AT THE TIME OF WRITING ALL LINUX SYSTEM HAD PYTHON 2 BY DEFAULT ALTHOUGH THERE ISN'T THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE BUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH SYNTAX WHEN THE ACTUAL TOPIC IS COMPLICATED ENOUGH IS JUST FRUSTRATING SO MY ADVICE IS LOOK UP BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT MATTER YOU WANT TO WORK ON AND USE WHATEVER THEY USE


I WOULD NOT SAY YOU HAVE WASTED YOUR TIME SINCE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED SO FAR WOULD BE MORE OR LESS REUSABLE IN PYTHON HOWEVER IF YOU CONTINUE TO LEARN AND PRACTISE IN PYTHON 2 YOU WILL NEED TO PUT SOME MORE TIME AND EFFORT INTO ADJUSTING YOURSELF TO THE CHANGES IN PYTHON LATER FOR EXAMPLE I STILL SOMETIMES FORGET TO ENCODE STRINGS INTO BYTES WHERE NEEDED SO IT WOULD HELP TO GET USED TO THESE CHANGES FROM THE BEGINNING
WHILE I PERSONALLY USED AND LIKE THAT BOOK IT IS VERY OLD AND DATED HIS PYTHON 2 STATEMENT PARTICULARLY IRKS A LOT OF PEOPLE

BUT DON'T WORRY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 2 AND ARE MINOR AND YOU'LL HAVE NO REAL TROUBLE SO IF THE BOOK IS WORKING FOR YOU CONTINUE AND FINISH IT

IF YOU LEARN PYTHON 2 PYTHON IS THE SAME YOU'LL BE FINE

YOU SHOULD GO WITH PYTHON WHEN YOU CAN IT'S DEFINITELY BETTER
THANKS FOR ALL THE INPUT GUYS I DECIDED TO STICK WITH SINCE A LOT OF THE LIBRARIES I WANT TO USE STILL RELY ON ALSO EVERYONE KEEPS SAYING IT WONT TAKE LONG TO TRANSITION ONCE I HAVE A GOOD GRASP WITH

THE FIRST JOB LISTED IS LEAD SOFTWARE ENGINEER FOR TIME WARNER CABLE THAT PERSON PROBABLY HAS A LOT MORE RESPONSIBILITIES THAN DOING SIMPLE WEB SCRAPS AND GETS PAID EXTRAORDINARILY WELL FOR IT
I DON'T THINK IT'S SAYING JUST THAT SKILL GIVES YOU THAT SALARY I TRIED SEARCHING SEVERAL PROG LANGUAGES AND THEY ALL GAVE ME LOW IT'S PROBABLY JUST MOST SOFTWARE RELATED ROLES ARE IN THAT RANGE AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE THAT SKILL LISTED

I THINK THE BEST WAY TO STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM IS TO MAKE A LINE CLASS HAS THE FIRST FUNCTION INHERENTLY IN THE THIRD FUNCTION CAN BE A METHOD WITHIN THE CLASS WITH ARGUMENTS SELF LINE 2 LINE AS FOR THE SECOND FUNCTION YOU MIGHT WANT TO CREATE A METHOD THAT TAKES A COEFFICIENT AS AN ARGUMENT AND RETURNS A STRING BASED ON THE COEFFICIENT VALUE EMPTY OR WITH A PLUS MINUS SIGN AND X Y AFTER AND THEN JOIN THE SIGN METHOD FOR EACH COEFFICIENT
QUESTIONS LIKE THIS SHOULD GO TO R LEARNPYTHON

R PYTHON IS NOT FOR HOMEWORK OR ASSIGNMENTS


I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF THIS EXAMPLE ALBUMCOLLECTION SHOULD JUST BE A LIST IT DOESN'T OFFER ANYTHING THAT A LIST DOESN'T IN FACT I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT APPEND WILL WORK THERE IS NO EXPLANATION OF THE BENEFIT OF INHERITING FROM MUTABLESEQUENCE EITHER

THIS LOOKS LIKE PYTHON WRITTEN BY A JAVA PROGRAMMER
SO I LOVE BUILT IN TYPES IF NOTHING ELSE THEY PROVIDE A CONSISTENT SYNTAX FOR OTHERS TO BASE THEIR OWN API ON

FOR EXAMPLE I DEAL WITH GEOMETRY A LOT IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO BORROW THE SET SYNTAX UNION INTERSECTION ETC AND APPLY IT TO MY GEOMETRY OBJECTS AND HAVE THIS LOVELY AUTOMATICALLY UNDERSTANDABLE CODE AFTERWARDS FOR OTHER PYTHON USERS
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA STORE YOUR TEACHER INSTANCES IN A DICTIONARY WITH THE KEY BEING THE NAME YOU WANT THEM TO BE SEARCHABLE BY SOMETHING LIKE PROF TEACHER OTHER PROF TEACHER THEN YOU CAN CHECK IF SUCH A NAME EXISTS WITH IF TEMP IN AND THEN RETRIEVE THE OBJECT WITH TEMP
OR YOU COULD JUST IMPLEMENT ON TOP OF CEDIS IT'S A STANDARD IT DOES RPC AND PUB SUB YOU GOT CLIENT FOR MANY LANGUAGES INCLUDING PYTHON JS PHS RUBY

LET'S NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL
HEY ALL I POSTED THIS HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT OTHER PYTHON DEVELOPERS THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF THE PROTOCOL ALL COMMENTS ARE WELCOME
IS NICE TO START PRACTICING BASICS
THIS IS A GOOD INTRO COURSE TO PROGRAMMING USING PYTHON

YOU NEED TO SUBMIT ASSIGNMENTS AND AS WELL AS GRADE YOUR PEERS ASSIGNMENTS IN ORDER TO PASS THE COURSE
ASK PYTHON

THINK PYTHON AND THE REST OF THE AERIE THAT USES PYTHON EAST G THINKDSP AND THINKBAYES

PYTHON AND FROM MICHAEL DRISCOLL WERE FREE RECENTLY
TRY AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON MIGHT BE MORE OF YOUR THING

I'D RECOMMEND ZED LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY BUT THE PYTHON VERSION OF THE BOOK IS STILL BEING WORKED ON IF YOU DON'T MIND LEARNING WHILE THE LANGUAGE IS PYTHON 2 THEY'RE QUITE SIMILAR ANYWAY OR BY READING THE ERROR FILLED PYTHON VERSION THEN I SUGGEST THOSE

LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY

AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF

WHILE I'M NOT SURE IF THEY HAVE ANSWER BANKS YOU'RE MORE THAN FREE TO GOOGLE THE ANSWERS OR ASK AROUND THE R LEARNPYTHON COMMUNITY
YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING RELEVANT BECAUSE THE SEARCH RESULTS ARE LOADED ASYNCHRONOUSLY WITH AJAX SO WHEN YOUR IS FIRED AND RETURNED YOU ONLY GET THE STATIC HEML PART WITHOUT WHATEVER THE JS PART LOADS

YOU HAVE A FEW OPTIONS FOR SOLVING THIS

REVERSE ENGINEER THE AJAX CALLS AND USE THOSE INSTEAD OF THE URI YOU CURRENTLY USE OPEN FIREBUG DEVELOPER TOOLS WHATEVER AND SEE WHAT CHR REQUESTS ARE SENT
USE A FULL-BLOWN SCRIPTABLE BROWSER LIKE SELENIUM WHICH WILL EXECUTE THE JAVASCRIPT AND ADD THE RESULTS TO THE DOM THEN YOU CAN TRAVERSE THE DOM AS EXPECTED BEWARE OF TIMING ISSUES
THE CONTENT OF EVERY SPAN IN A DIV WITH THAT CLASSICAL

ARE THERE MULTIPLE SPANS PER DIV OR DOES EACH DIV HAVE JUST ONE SPAN

INTRODUCES A NEW SYNTAX FOR HANDLING COROUTINES

PRETTY SURE WOULD WORK FINE WITH CIVY AS LONG AS YOU DON'T USE THE NEW ASYNCIO SYNTAX
YOU CAN USE CIVY WITH PYTHON ON WINDOWS IF YOU DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL A WHEEL FROM HERE

IT WORKED FOR ME TRY


PIP INSTALL DOCUTILS PIGMENTS PYPIWIN SDL 2
PIP INSTALL CIVY
IF IT'S JUST GOING TO BE DESKTOP APP AND IT'S NOT A PROJECT FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEARNING CIVY I WOULD CHECK OUT BAYSIDE QT IS AN EASY TO USE MATURE FRAMEWORK
IF MOBILE S IN THE FUTURE GO FOR IT IT'S ON MY LIST OF THINGS TO LEARN AS WELL BUT NOTHING BEATS BAYSIDE AND QT DESIGNER FOR QUICKLY GETTING A UI TOGETHER
CIVY IS NOT WORKING AT ALL FOR ME ON WINDOWS FOLLOWED THE INSTALL STEPS AND STACKOVERFLOW HELP NO SOLUTION WHATSOEVER I CAN'T GET THE APP TO LOAD AT ALL AND IT SAYS MY OPENGL VERSION IS WHEN IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THAT

I'D STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM CIVY FOR WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT
THE PY IS THE ONLY PLACE I'D EVER ADVISE USING FROM X IMPORT BUT EVEN IN A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER THE NAMESPACE I'D STILL ADVISE USING EXPLICIT IMPORTS IF YOU CAN AS THAT IS A BIG BOON TO READERS OF YOUR CODE OTHERWISE YOU SHOULD REALLY HAVE DOCUMENTATION THAT DETAILS WHAT ENDS UP IN EACH OF THE NAMESPACES SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO HUNTING WITH DIR
IT'S PYTHON YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO HIDE EVERYTHING

THAT SAID I WOULDN'T EXPECT THE COMMON USAGE TO BE IMPORT AN INSTEAD FROM IMPORT UNLOOP BUTTON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IT'S OKAY TO USE IMPORT HERE AS LONG AS YOU SET IN YOUR
FLUENT PYTHON FROM O'REILLY MEDIA
PERHAPS DIVE INTO PYTHON
I'D PICK UP PYTHON ESSENTIAL REFERENCE BY BEAZLEY AND THEN MAYBE SIT AT BARNES AND NOBLE READING THE PYTHON COOKBOOK FOR PART OF AN AFTERNOON JUST TO GET A FEEL FOR THINGS GOOGLE WILL FILL IN THE REST
THIS TITLE IS SO CLICKBAITY
TWO IDEAS

INSTALL PONTIFY ON THE ANDROID EMULATOR THERE ARE WEBSITES WHERE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE PONTIFY AP GOOGLE IT THERE YOU HAVE ROOT AND YOU CAN VIEW THE LOGS WITH LOGGAT
DECOMPILE THE AP AND LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SOURCE

FOR THE NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD POST SUCH QUESTIONS IN R LEARNPYTHON
NICE SUMMARY BUT UNFORTUNATELY SKIPS MENTIONING THE MOST IMPORTANT PART VERSION COMPATIBILITY

PYTHON UNFORTUNATELY SEEMS QUITE DEAD IN THE WATER HAVING HAD ITS LAST RELEASE WHICH BROUGHT COMPATIBILITY IN MAY

IRONPYTHON LOOKS SLIGHTLY BETTER ALTHOUGH IT'S LATEST RELEASE ALSO ONLY TARGETS THERE IS AN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH WORKING TOWARDS X COMPATIBILITY


PIPY CURRENTLY SUPPORTS UP TO IS IN ALPHA AND MONTILLA IS SPONSORING WORK TO GET IT UP TO IN THE NEARISH FUTURE

PISTON WAS STARTED WITH THE EXPRESS GOAL OF ONLY SUPPORTING THIS HAS SINCE BEEN SLIGHTLY QUALIFIED THAT X SUPPORT IS EVENTUALLY DESIRED SO FAR IT ALSO ONLY SUPPORTS LINUX AND ADAMIK DOESN'T YET FULFILL ITS PERFORMANCE TARGETS

PYJION LOOKS VERY INTERESTING AND WILL HAVE FULL X SUPPORT SINCE IT'S BASICALLY JUST A PUGIN TO PYTHON BUT IS STILL MUCH TOO EARLY TO TELL HOW IT WILL WORK OUT

COTHON IS PROVEN AND CAN BE VERY USEFUL IN CERTAIN CASES BUT CAN'T BE REALLY CONSIDERED A PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION SINCE IT CHANGES THE SYNTAX

SO TO SUMMARIZE THE ONLY REAL CONTENDERS IMO CURRENTLY ARE PYTHON AND PIPY WITH MAYBE PYTHON IRONPYTHON IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO WORK IN THE AVM CLR
SOMETHING THE ARTICLE DOESN'T MENTION PYTHON AND IRONPYTHON ARE BOTH THIS IS FANTASTIC IF YOU NEED TO WRITE CODE THAT SCALES OUT TO MULTIPLE CORE PROCESSORS WHILE STILL HAVING MUTABLE SHARED STATE

EDIT

PYTHON AND IRONPYTHON HAVE FAILED TO IMPLEMENT THE THE GLORIOUS GIL OF THE PYTHON INTERPRETER SO CODE THAT IMPLICITLY RELIES ON ONLY A SINGLE THREAD OF PYTHON CODE RUNNING AT ONE TIME MIGHT EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS ADDITIONALLY YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANGUAGE BY IDENTIFYING WHICH PARTS OF YOUR CODE CAN AND CANNOT BE EXECUTED CONCURRENTLY BECAUSE ALL OF IT WILL EXECUTE CONCURRENTLY

I FOR ONE HOPE THAT IRONPYTHON AND PYTHON GET AROUND TO IMPLEMENTING THE GIL AS THEY PUSH TOWARDS PYTHON COMPATIBILITY
MICROPYTHON
RANDOM QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO ABSTRACT A LOT OF THIS KNOWLEDGE INTO A

I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF C AND LEARNED ABOUT INTERFACES WHICH PUT FORTH A CONTRACT FOR A CLASS TO IMPLEMENT TO ADHERE TO THAT INTERFACE

IS IT SAFE TO CONSIDER PYTHON TO BE AKIN TO AN INTERFACE WHILE PYTHON PIPY ETC ARE THE IMPLEMENTATION IE THEY WILL ALL IMPLEMENT THE SAME FEATURES JUST DIFFERENTLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT FEATURES IMPLEMENTED IN ALL OF THEM SHOULD PROVIDE IDENTICAL RESULTS JUST WITH DIFFERENT PERFORMANCES OR DO SOME FEATURES FUNDAMENTALLY DO DIFFERENT THINGS
A MINOR NOTE THE PYTHON DEV TEAM AND THE PSF ARE UNRELATED AND ONLY VAGUELY OVERLAPPING AT THIS POINT
NUITKA JUST PARSES YOUR CODE AND CREATES C SOURCE FILES WITH CALLS TO PYTHON C API FUNCTIONS INSTEAD OF EXECUTING PYTHON CODE EVERY TIME
PIPY IS ALREADY WORKING ON PYTHON SUPPORT YOU CAN ALREADY TRY NIGHTLY VERSIONS

I THINK THAT WHILE WHAT YOU ARE DOING MAY BE POSSIBLE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER WHETHER IT'S A GOOD IDEA A DOCTORING SHOULDN'T AFFECT THE EXECUTION OF THE CODE

HOW DO I SETUP TESTING AND STAGING ENVIRONMENTS FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THIS HOW DO I RUN ALL OF THIS ON A LAPTOP SO I CAN TEST NEW FEATURES AND DEBUG LOCALLY IS THERE A VERSION OF ASW LAMBDA THAT RUNS LOCALLY OR A GOOD WAY TO SIMULATE IT FOR DEVELOPMENT
PYTHON IS A BETTER LANGUAGE BUT THE PYTHONCALYPSE REALLY TOOK IT'S TOLL ON THE COMMUNITY
REFLECTS ONLY USERS OF SOME RANDOM CI SERVICE
ALMOST UNDERSTANDABLE THE AMOUNT OF EXISTING PYTHON 2 IMPLEMENTATIONS LEGACY SOFTWARE IS A THORN IN ALL OF OUR SIDES

BUT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT TO BE IN PYTHON 2 JUST MAKES NO SENSE I HAVE A FEELING THAT PEOPLE ON A DEFAULT MACHINE ARE JUST TYPING IN PYTHON AND DON'T KNOW OF PYTHON AND ALIASING IN GENERAL
DELETED

WHAT IS THIS
SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO BE THINKING NOBODY HAS A REASON FOR NEW PROJECTS IN WELL I CAN TELL YOU OUR MAYA MAYA IS AN AWFUL PIECE OF TRASH SOFTWARE BUT IT'S AN INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR ANIMATION FX ETC WITH FEW REALISTIC ALTERNATIVES ANYBODY THAT HAS TO PROGRAM FOR THAT INDUSTRY IS STUCK WITH PYTHON 2

I'VE HEARD RUMOURS THAT AUTODESK WILL START TO SUPPORT PYTHON IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS BUT I'LL BELIEVE THAT WHEN I SEE IT
DEPRESSING
PRETTY LOGICAL AND OBVIOUS
I'M NOT SAYING STICK WITH 2 I USE EXCLUSIVELY BUT 2 WILL BE SUPPORTED PAST THE DEADLINES OF BY A 3RD PARTY SO THERE'S NO STRONG ENGINEERING REASON TO STOP USING IT
PYTHON WILL ALWAYS BE SUPERIOR EDIT OME
OFCOURSE LOOK INTO PYAUTOGUI
IF POSSIBLE IT'S MUCH CLEANER AND EASIER TO READ VALUES OUT OF MEMORY RATHER THAN ATTEMPTING PIXEL READING TRY FAMILIARIZING YOURSELF WITH MEMORY USING CHEAT ENGINE AND THEN YOU CAN MOVE YOUR WORK INTO PYTHON USING LIBRARIES LIKE PYMEM OR WINAPPDBG

MEMORY READING IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT PROTECTION IF THE GAME HAS RUDIMENTARY MEMORY WRITING IS WHAT YOU WANT TO AVOID IF IT'S A AAA GAME YOU'RE LIABLE TO GET CAUGHT REGARDLESS
PYAUTOGUI PILLOW
CHAPTER
IS THE GAME OLD SCHOOL RUNESCAPE
PYAUTOGUI IS QUITE HANDY AND GREAT MODULE FOR YOUR TASK MAKE SURE YOU GO THROUGH THE DOCUMENTATION TO EXPLORE ALL THE TASKS THAT YOU CAN DO USING IT SINCE YOU ARE NEW TO PROGRAMMING THIS HABIT OF LEARNING FROM DOCUMENTATION WILL BE THE BEST THING IN LONG TERM
DELETED

WHAT IS THIS
PYTHON 2 DOESN'T HAVE AN INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION OF UNICODE IT DOESN'T ENFORCE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A STRING AND AN ARRAY OF BYTES OR TO BE MORE PRECISE IN PYTHON 2 A STR IS AN ARRAY OF BYTES WHICH IT SHOULDN'T BE YOU CAN WRITE CODE IN PYTHON 2 JUST FINE IT'S JUST TRICKIER
THE DIFFERENCE ISN'T THAT PYTHON 2 DID UNICODE WRONG IT'S THAT IT DEFAULTED TO TREATING STRINGS AS SEQUENCES OF BYTES WITH NO REAL UNDERSTANDING OF ENCODING YOU CAN DO UNICODE IN PYTHON 2 BUT IT TAKES A LOT MORE EFFORT BECAUSE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UNICODE AND STR IS A LOT MORE FLUID AND YOU CAN OFTEN COMBINE THE TWO TYPES IN OPERATIONS PYTHON MAKES STR PROPER UNICODE STRINGS AND INTRODUCES A SEPARATE BYTES TYPE USED FOR ENCODED STRINGS AT A GLANCE THEY LOOK LIKE UNICODE AND STR TYPES IN 2 BUT THE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IS THAT YOU CAN'T MIX THEM FREELY BYTES OBJECTS HAVE TO BE DECODED BEFORE THEY CAN BE PROCESSED FURTHER
ONE EXAMPLE

B XED ABD DECODE DTF ENCODE DTF

THIS PRODUCES INVALID DTF WITH PYTHON 2 WHILE IT FAILS WITH PYTHON

BECAUSE PYTHON 2 ALLOWED SURROGATES IN UNICODE BY DEFAULT
PYTHON 2 DIDN'T IMPLEMENT UNICODE INCORRECTLY WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY GOT IT WRONG THEY ARE REFERRING TO HOW THE TYPE THAT IS CALLED STRING IN PYTHON 2 IS A BYTESTRING AND HOW THAT IS THE DEFAULT TYPE FOR STRING OPERATIONS AS WELL AS I O AND CODE FILES UNICODE STRINGS THAT IS ACTUAL STRINGS THAT REPRESENT SEQUENCES OF CODE POINTS RATHER THAN SEQUENCES OF BYTES ARE CALLED UNICODE IN PYTHON 2 AND CREATING THEM USUALLY INVOLVES EXPLICIT ACTION DECODING BYTESTRINGS OR PREFIXING YOUR STRING LITERALS WITH U

IN PYTHON STRINGS ARE PROPER UNICODE STRINGS AND WHAT USED TO BE CALLED STRING IS NOW CALLED BYTES STRING FUNCTIONS DEFAULT TO UNICODE STRINGS SOURCE FILES ARE PARSED AS DTF BY DEFAULT AND STRING LITERALS ARE UNICODE STRINGS UNLESS YOU PREFIX THEM WITH B TO MAKE THEM BYTESTRINGS

WHEN TRANSITIONING TO PYTHON SOME LIBRARIES HAVE GONE A BIT OVERBOARD SOME SGI IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR EXAMPLE INCORRECTLY TREAT HETP AS A TEXTUAL PROTOCOL AND UNCRITICALLY EXPOSE THINGS AS UNICODE STRINGS THAT SHOULD BE BYTESTRINGS EAST G NRL PATHS AND HEADERS ON THE WHOLE HOWEVER THE SITUATION IN PYTHON IS MUCH SANER THAN IN 2
PYTHON 2 SUPPOSES THAT THE FILES CONTAINING YOUR CODE ARE IN ASCII BY DEFAULT AND THAT THE STRINGS YOU DECLARE WILL PRODUCE BYTES OBJECTS AND WILL BE TEXT IMPLICITLY ENCODED WITH THE CHARET OF SAID FILES

PYTHON SUPPOSES THAT THE FILES CONTAINING YOUR CODE ARE DTF BY DEFAULT AND THE STRINGS YOU DECLARE WILL PRODUCE GENERIC TEXT OBJECTS NOT TIED TO ANY ENCODING

BOTTOM LINE

DEFAULT SETTINGS IN PYTHON 2 WILL TRY TO PRODUCE ENCODED ASCII TEXT IN MEMORY FAILING AS SOON AS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ASCII ENTER IN THE GAME


B I BYTES ENCODING DEPENDS OF YOUR TERMINAL
IMPORT FOO BYTES ENCODING DEPENDS OF YOUR FILE
B POSSIBLE DUCKERY

MOST COMMON FUCK UP ARE

PEOPLE READING A FILE AND NOT DECODING IT GETTING BYTE IN AN ENCODING THEY DON'T BOTHER TO DETECT THEN LATER THEY MANIPULATE IT AND IT EXPLODES
PEOPLE PUTTING NON ASCII CARACTER IN THEIR CODE WITHOUT SPECIFYING THE ENCODING GETTING UNICODEDECODEERROR IMMEDIATLY
PEOPLE TRYING TO PRINT IN THEIR TERMINAL SOMETHING THEY GOT FORM THE WEB A FILE THE DB WITHOUT DECODING AND BOOM


DEFAULT SETTINGS IN PYTHON WILL MOSTLY WORK OUT OF THE BOX AND IF YOU DO ENCOUNTER SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T NON DTF ENCODED BYTE INCOMING FIXING IT IS JUST A DECODE OR AN ENCODE AWAY


B I NON ENCODED TEXT
IMPORT FOO NON ENCODED TEXT
B HAPPY CODER


AS A RESULT

MOST OF THE TIME EVERYTHING WORKS
IF SOMETHING IS UNUSUAL AND REQUIRE YOU TO KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING PYTHON WILL PUT AN ERROR VERY EARLY IN YOUR PROCESSING USUALLY AT THE LEVEL OF THE TEXT INPUT WHICH MAKE IT EASY TO GOOGLE THE SOLUTION THE SOLUTION IS USUALLY CALLING DECODE ENCODE WITH THE PROPER ENCODING THE HARD PART BEING FINDING THE PROPER ENCODING

THE ONLY PROBLEM MAY BE THE SPACING OF THE LETTER FOR THE AVERAGE SCORE IT'S DYNAMIC DATA SO IT MIGHT SHIFT TO THE LEFT OR TO THE RIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW MANY CHARACTERS THERE ARE FOR THE SCORE YOU MAY WANT TO POKE AT THAT

AS THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A VALUE SUGGESTED FOR THE OUT OF BOUNDS GRADES I JUST SET IT TO RETURN UNKNOWN REFINE THAT IF YOU NEED TO

NOTE THAT YOU COULD ALSO ASSIGN THE NUMBER OF SCORES REQUIRED TO A VARIABLE THEN USE A LOOP AND PERFORM THE SAME OPERATION FOR EACH ONE THE PROGRAM BECOMES MORE EXTENSIBLE AS IT CAN CATER FOR LARGER SETS OF DATA AND YOU AVOID REPETITION

GOOD WORK I LOVE ANYTHING I CAN LEARN ABOUT PROGRAMMING AUDIO PROCESSING CAN'T WAIT TO TEAR THIS THING APART I KNOW SOME MAX SUPER COLLIDER AND SOME PYTHON BUT AS FOR IMPLEMENTING THEM TOGETHER I'VE NEVER TRIED TRIED MUSIC IN PYTHON THOUGH SUPER COLLIDER IS AMAZING FOR MAKING SYNTHS BUT I HATE THE MAGIC OF IT THE WHOLE POINT IS I WANT TO LEARN HOW IT WORKS


I'VE WRITTEN CODE THAT DOES MUCH THE SAME THING AS A SIDE EFFECT FOR MY MUSIC VISUALIZATION PROJECTS HERE'S A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE THAT SUMMARIZES THE ALGORITHM

SINCE IT'S RUNNING LIVE IN UNITY THE BEST WAY I COULD FIGURE OUT TO DO IT WAS GETTING THE FFT OF THE SAMPLE ONCE INTO A LARGE ARRAY THEN SUM UP EACH MAXIMUM FREQUENCY RESPONSE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PITCH BANDS WHICH INCREASE IN SIZE OF COURSE AS YOU GO HIGHER THIS GIVES YOU THE TOTAL RESPONSE IN EACH GIVEN PITCH CLASSICAL AS FOR WHY I USED THE MAXIMUM RESPONSE INSTEAD OF THE ENTIRE AMPLITUDE OF EACH PITCH BIN I JUST FOUND IT LOOKED BETTER THERE'S A LOT OF VARIETY IN HOW THESE THINGS CHROMA FEATURES ARE CALCULATED

THIS IS MUCH OF THE SAME APPROACH EMPLOYED BY MUSIC RECOGNITION MACHINES SO I FIGURED THAT WOULD GIVE ME GOOD DISTINCTIVE VISUALIZATIONS THAT ACTUALLY LOOK DIFFERENT FROM SONG TO SONG AND PARTICULARLY GENRE TO GENRE I CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO MAKE DIFFERENT KEYS DISTINGUISHABLE

THEN THE FUN BIT IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE THAT N ARRAY OF PITCH AMPLITUDES TO ACTUALLY MAKE COOL THINGS IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED HERE HETP IS MY PAGE WITH SOME DEMO VIDEOS AND SOME OF MY PHILOSOPHY TOWARDS THE ARTICLE
COOL I WANNA TRY THIS AND COMPARE AGAINST THE HILBERT TRANSFORM FOR PITCH DETECTION
WHY DOES DEMONIZING THE SERVER CHANGE THE CD

BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE TRADITIONAL STEPS OF DEMONIZING

HOW DO I FIX IT

USE ABSOLUTE PATHS OR CHANGE THE CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY YOURSELF

CREATE A SMALL APPLICATION THAT ALLOWS A USER TO INPUT LOCATION DATA AND DISPLAYS THE CURRENT WEATHER INFORMATION BASED ON THAT LOCATION ALLOW THE USER TO SAVE THE LOCATIONS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO INPUT THEM EVERY TIME

YOU COULD DO IT ALL OF IT CLIENT SIDE AS A SPA BUT USE DURANGO FLASK AS YOUR API

PROXY THE WEATHER CALLS TO THE ACTUAL WEATHER API
CRUD THE USER'S CITIES
BUILD A BLOG EVERYBODY STARTS WITH A BLOG
DJANGOGIRLS TUTORIAL BUILDS A BLOG AND THE OFFICIAL DURANGO TUTORIAL BUILDS A POLLS APPLICATION THOSE COULD BE GOOD STARTING POINTS
BRRR EXCELLENT PRESENTATION OF THE CONCEPT BUT I HAVE A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION YOU PROPOSE

IN THE ABSENCE OF A GOOD TRIE IMPLEMENTATION YOU'D PROBABLY GO FOR A HASH TABLE A KING A AS A DICTIONARY IN PYTHON THE PERFORMANCE COST IS THAT OF

CALCULATING THE HASH VALUES

TRAVERSING WHATEVER DATA STRUCTURE LIST TABLE TREE UNDERLIES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DICTIONARY

A TRIE WILL HELP YOU AVOID THAT COST IF YOU IMPLEMENT IT ON A LOW LEVEL I EAST VIA POINTERS TO TREE NODES IMPLEMENTING THE TRIE USING DICTIONARIES IMPOSES ON YOU AGAIN THE OVERHEAD OF HASH CALCULATION AND LOOKUP
NICE READ ON TRIES BUT I HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE SOLUTION YOU POSTED UP ON YOUR GITLAB LINK

IF YOU SORT THE WORDS BEFORE STORING THEM IN THE TRIE AND THEN STORE THE REGULAR WORD IN A LIST AT THE END OF THE TRIE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY ITERATION TRYING TO FIND A RANDOM ANAGRAM YOU CAN JUST GET ALL THE ANAGRAMS AND PICK ONE AT RANDOM

THIS LOOKS REALLY INTERESTING IS THIS COURSE ENOUGH TO APPLY FOR ENTRY LEVEL MACHINE LEARNING JOBS
SEEMS THE CONTENT IS PACKED AND MAY WELL WORTH FOR WHAT IF OFFERS DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE ACCESS IS PERMANENT AND THEY WILL NOT EVER TAKE THE SITE DOWN WELL THAT'S A BIT OPTIMISTIC OR AT LEAST I CAN DOWNLOAD IT LOCALLY

I WOULD PROBABLY ADD IT TO MY KNOWLEDGE BASE AND GIVE IT A LOOK DURING A HIGH MOON

IF RECOMMEND READING PYTHON PROGRAMMING AN INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE BY JOHN ZELLE IT'S PRETTY GOOD
THE VERY FIRST THING I DID TO CUT MY TEETH ON PYTHON WAS THE PYTHON COURSE FROM CODE ACADEMY

LEARN PYTHON

ITS A DECENT INTERACTIVE OVERVIEW TO THE VERY BASICS OF PYTHON

FROM THERE AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF IS A GOOD NEXT STEP BUT IT WILL LIKELY TAKE LONGER TO GET THROUGH THE BOOK WHEREAS CODE ACADEMY YOU CAN HAMMER OUT IN A DAY OR SO
I HAVE HEARD GREAT THINGS OF AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON SO I THINK THAT'S A SAFE BET HOWEVER I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE LATTER SO DON'T TAKE MY OPINION AS INFINITE WISDOM
IS AUTOMATING BORING STUFF BETTER BECAUSE IT FOCUS ONLY ON PYTHON
I HAVE BOTH AND AUTOMATE MAY BE BETTER IF YOU ARE TOTALLY NEW TO PYTHON BUT NOT PROGRAMMING BUT THAT'S SUBJECTIVE I LIKED PART II VERY MUCH
PYTHON CRASH COURSE MAY HAVE A BETTER PART I IF YOU ARE NEW TO CODING IT'S VERY DETAILED BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE PART II PROJECTS VERY MUCH


BTW YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEARN PYTHON ON THE RASPBERRY PI YOU COULD CODE IN ANY PLATFORM AND RUN YOUR PROGRAMS IN THE PI
IF YOUR BRAND NEW TO PROGRAMING LIKE ME I SUGGEST

LEARN HOME WELCOME
IF YOU ARE A BOOB THEN YOU SHOULD LOOK AT AN INTRO PYTHON COURSE
FYI I'VE READ THAT YOU SHOULD STILL USE A ENV TO INSTALL PYTHON DES EVEN WHEN INSIDE A DOCKER CONTAINER
CHECK OUT PYCHARM COMMUNITY EDITION
USE THE NOTEBOOK TO DEVELOP THE CODE TO START OFF WITH YOU'LL LEARN QUICKER WITH THE FAST FEEDBACK

WHEN YOU'VE MADE SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IT INTO A MODULE AND IMPORT IT IN THE NOTEBOOK TO CONTINUE WORKING ON NEW PARTS

IF YOU KNOW YOUR EDITORS WELL THEN USE AN EDITOR OF YOUR PREFERENCE I'M PARTIAL TO VIM

IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH YOUR EDITORS THEN MAYBE TRY A NOTEBOOK
DOING SCIENCE INSTALL THE ANACONDA DISTRIBUTION THEN USE JUPITER NOTEBOOK TO TRY OUT IDEAS AND TEST SMALL BITS OF CODE ONCE YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN A FEW PARAGRAPHS FIRE UP SNYDER A PYTHON ENVIRONMENT TO TURN YOUR CODE INTO AN PROGRAM

BASICALLY THE NOTEBOOK WILL SERVE YOU VERY WELL UNTIL YOU NEED TO WRITE A PROGRAM YOU CAN CALL FROM THE SHELL AND THEN IT'S TIME TO WRITE SOME PY FILES
FOR A RESEARCH PROJECT I THINK A NOTEBOOK IS MUCH BETTER JUPITER NOTEBOOK IS SUPER EASY AND GREAT FOR CODE WHERE YOU'RE TESTING OUT AND PROTOTYPING SMALL CHUNKS AT A TIME IF IT WILL BE CONVERTED TO A MODULE LIBRARY WEBAPP THEN YOU SHOULD EVENTUALLY USE AN ACTUAL EDITOR
JUPITER IS HANDS DOWN YOUR BEST BET IMHO I'D SAY I DO OF MY DEVELOPMENT IN NOTEBOOKS

IT'S A VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND EASY TO USE REPL AND DESIGNED FOR RESEARCH

WATCH V
I PERSONALLY USE A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE NOTEBOOKS ARE CREATE TO PROTOTYPE AND TO VISUALIZE THINGS HOWEVER WHEN YOU ARE WRITING LOTS OF CODE THEY TEND TO GET CLUTTERED PRETTY EASILY MY WORKFLOW LOOKS LIKE THAT I START TRYING OUT THINGS IN A NOTEBOOK IN THE NEXT STEP I START TO REFRACTOR PARTS OF IT AS FUNCTIONS AND CLASSES AS NEEDED IF I THINK THAT ONE OF THESE PARTS IS IMPORTANT AND REUSABLE I COPY IT OVER INTO A PYTHON MODULE I WRITE IN PARALLEL FOR THE SPECIFIC PROJECT I ADD DOCUMENTATION CLEAN UP THE CODE AND MAYBE ADD UNIT TESTAMENT AS A MODULE HAS MULTIPLE FILES FOR STRUCTURE I AM USING AN TEXTEDITOR OR IDE FOR THAT IN MY NOTEBOOK I JUST IMPORT MY MODULE AND AND USE THE CLEANED UP FUNCTIONS AT THE END I HAVE A READABLE NOTEBOOK TO PRESENT THE PROJECT AND A REUSABLE MODULE THAT HAS ALL THE TOOLS NEEDED TO BUILD A NEW SIMILAR ONE
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH IT

IF YOU ARE ANALYZING LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA AND NEED A LOT OF INTERMEDIATE RESULTS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT AN PYTHON NOTEBOOK IS GREAT YOU CAN COPY PASTE THE CODE INTO A PYTHON FILE LATER

IN MOST OTHER CASES OR IF YOUR DATASET IS SMALL AND YOU CAN YOUR SCRIPT FAST ENOUGH I'D PREFER AN EDITOR
IF ALL YOU WANT IS TO TEST OUT THE SYNTAX YOU COULD USE THIS IS AN ONLINE EDITOR IN WHICH YOU CAN ACTUALLY EXECUTE YOUR CODE AND SEE THE RESULTS IF YOU MAKE SYNTAX ERRORS IT WILL ALSO TELL YOU AND YOU CAN ALSO IMPORT PACKAGES
2 NOW YOU COULD ALSO SIMPLY INSTALL PYTHON ON YOUR LAPTOP THEN START THE PYTHON INTERPRETER CONSOLE AND PLAY WITH THE SYNTAX HOWEVER YOU WANT
AS A COMPLEMENT TO YOUR COURSE I SUGGEST YOU TO GET A GOOD PYTHON BOOK SUCH AS THIS ONE

AS A SIDE NOTE THIS TYPE OF QUESTION SHOULD BE ASKED UNDER R LEARNPYTHON YOU WILL PROBABLY GET EVEN BETTER ANSWERS THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE USED TO ANSWERING BEGINNER QUESTIONS
THESE GUYS RECOMMENDING JUPITER NOTEBOOK ARE GIVING YOU GOOD ADVICE
CHEERS EVERYONE ANACONDA LOOKS THE WAY TO GO
EMACS WILL BE THE BEST IF YOU WANT FAST RESULTS
NUMBER
FINDING A GOOD EDITOR WILL HELP LIKE PYCHARM HOWEVER THERE IS MORE TO LEARNING A LANGUAGE THAN THE BASE SYNTAX THERE IS ALSO THE RIGHT WAY VS THE WRONG WAY OF DOING THINGS THIS IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WITH PYTHON WHICH IS VERY STRICT ABOUT ITS SYNTAX I FOUND THE BOOK IDIOMATIC PYTHON INVALUABLE IN HELPING BOTH LEARN THE SYNTAX AND LEARN THE RIGHT WAY FOR THINGS YOU CAN ALSO LOAD A MODULE PLAINT THAT WILL TELL YOU HOW GOOD YOUR CODE IS

DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU ARE DOING

IF YOU ARE DEVELOPING A MODULE LIBRARY OR WORKING ON A LARGER PROJECT USE AN IDE LIKE PYCHARM THE CODE INTELLIGENCE AND REFRACTURING TOOLS ARE INVALUABLE IN NAVIGATING MODIFYING A MORE SOPHISTICATED CODEBASE

IF YOU ARE ONLY WORKING ON ONE SCRIPT AT A TIME ONLY USING MODULES SOMEONE ELSE HAS DEVELOPER OR ARE DOING PURELY INTERACTIVE WORK JUPITER NOTEBOOK IS A BETTER OPTION

IN KEEPING WITH THIS PHILOSOPHY I TYPICALLY DEVELOP MY MODULES ENTIRELY IN PYCHARM AND PUT THE INTERACTIVE USAGE EXAMPLES FOR END USERS INTO JUPITER NOTEBOOKS




WRONG SUB GO TO R LEARNPYTHON
IT'S URLLIB
AND IT'S JUST 2 EXTRANEOUS LAST CHARACTERS WRONG
AN EXPLANATION AND AN EXAMPLE OF THE CORRECT APPROACH WOULD MAKE THIS POST MUCH MORE HELPFUL IS THIS SPECIFIC TO PYTHON 2
HOW ABOUT OVERRIDING THE EXCEPTHOOK

IMPORT SS
DEF HOOK AGS WARGUS
PRINT AN ERROR HAPPENED
RETURN SS AGS WARGUS

HOOK

AN ERROR HAPPENED
TRACEBACK MOST RECENT CALL LAST
FILE LINE IN
ZERODIVISIONERROR DIVISION BY ZERO
INT NO INTEGER
AN ERROR HAPPENED
TRACEBACK MOST RECENT CALL LAST
FILE LINE IN
VALUEERROR INVALID LITERAL FOR INT WITH BASE NO INTEGER

NOW YOU CAN EXECUTE EVERY CODE YOU LIKE BEFORE A ERROR APPEND MAIL YOU THE ERROR MESSAGE LOG EVERY ERROR PUSHING IT INTO A DATABASE AND SO ON SS IS THE ORIGINAL HOOK

AS A LITTLE NOTE THIS DOESN'T WORK GOOD WITH JUPITER AND PYTHON BECAUSE BOTH ALREADY OVERRIDE THE ORIGINAL PYTHON MESSAGE WITH THEIR MORE DETAILED TRACEBACK
YOU SUBMIT THIS GARBAGE BLOG POST WHERE YOU'RE JUST LISTING LINKS FROM THIS VERY SAME SUB AND DIDN'T EVEN CHANGE THE TITLE OH OKAY THERE'S ORIGINAL CONTENT IN THE BLOGPOST THE ADVERTISEMENTS YOU'VE PUT IN

USE THE SUBPROCESS MODULE MAYBE A BIT LIKE THIS
YOUR PROBLEM IN AN ATTEMPT TO EDIT DB AT ONE MOMENT

BUT ONLY ONE PROCESS CAN BE MAKING CHANGES TO THE DATABASE AT ANY MOMENT IN TIME HOWEVER

OR MAYBE BECAUSE THAT YOU DON'T USE METHOD LIKE BEGININSERTROWS BEGINMOVEROWS ETC IN YOUR QT APPARENTLY
IT'S HARD TO SAY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CODE BUT IF I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM PROPERLY IS THAT SQLALCHEMY DOESN'T RETURN UPDATED DATA FROM YOUR QUERIES I RAN INTO A SIMILAR ISSUE IN A FLASK APPLICATION

I HAD ACCIDENTALLY INSTANTIATED SQLALCHEMY TWICE AND WAS USING THEM BOTH WHICH MEANT QUERIES WOULD RETURN ONLY THE DATA IN THE DB AT THE START OF THE APPARENTLY
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN PYCHARM HAS THIS FEATURE BUILT IN AND IT MAKES FOR SOME VERY PROFESSIONAL AND NICE LOOKING CODE ALBEIT I AM CERTAINLY GUILTY OF IGNORING SOME OF THE CAPITALIZATION CONVENTIONS
I LOVE LINTERS AND USE FLAKE IN ATOM I THINK IT SHOULD BE NOTED THOUGH THAT YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR ERRORS HAPPEN BEFORE YOU FIX THEM I HAVE DEFINITELY HAD THE LINTER OUTLINE ERRORS THAT ARE NOT ACTUALLY A PROBLEM
THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE INSTALLED PYTHON BUT YOU TRIED TO RUN PYTHON TRY


PYTHON

PY



FILE

ANY OF THESE COMMANDS SHOULD WORK IF YOU ARE USING WINDOWS

RLEARNPYTHON
ANOTHER TIP USE POWERSHELL NOT CMD
SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF TROUBLE AND INSTALL THE ANACONDA DISTRIBUTION OF PYTHON
THE PYTHON INSTALLER DOESN'T ADD THE BIN DIRECTORY TO THE PATH FOR SOME REASON YOU CAN ADD IT YOURSELF IF YOU CAN FIND IT I'VE HAD A COUPLE INSTALLS THAT DIDN'T GET PUT INTO C PROGRAM FILES
THIS IS WHY I ALWAYS SUGGEST WINPYTHON

EXTRACT IT DOUBLE CLICK THE CMD

RUN EVERYTHING IN THERE
I WOULD TRY TO GET LINUX RUNNING COMES INSTALLED BY DEFAULT ON UBUNTU AND FEDORA I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'VE USED LINUX OR NOT BUT IF YOU CAN AT LEAST GET IT RUNNING IN A VM YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH BETTER DEVELOPING EXPERIENCE
ARE YOU USING REQUESTS OR SELENIUM SELENIUM LOOKS LIKE A USER BUT THEY MIGHT NOT BE SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO BE FOOLED BY THAT IN GENERAL IT'S POLITE TO ADD A DELAY PROPORTIONAL TO SERVER RESPONSE TIME USE A RANDOM DELAY WAIT FOR SECONDS EVERY NOW AND THEN BUT YOU ARE A BOT AND ARE VIOLATING THEIR TOS AND ARE THEIR ENEMY USE TOR OR CHANGE IP EVERY NOW AND THEN

VERY COOL AND HELPFUL

WISH IT WAS THOUGH
WHAT IS THAT
SIMPLE KEY EXCHANGE

THIS IS A RATHER INSECURE EXAMPLE WITH EXTREMELY LOW PRIMES I MEAN IT'S FINE AS A TOY EXERCISE BUT WHY WOULD THIS BELONG TO A CHEATSHEET YOU SHOULD REALLY BE USING A CRYPTO LIBRARY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
LOOKS LIKE AND NOT
THEORETICALLY IF YOU MADE ENOUGH CHEAT SHEETS YOU WOULD PROACTIVELY GENERATE EVERY POSSIBLE PROGRAM THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF INDEXING
WOW SURPRISING ME

WHEN I OPEN THE LINK IT'S MY DEMO WEBSITE

THERE ARE A LOT OF TOPICS WHICH I DO NOT FINISH YET

ANYWAY THANKS FOR SHARING IT


I THINK THIS IS EVEN MORE HELPFUL THAN THE LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY BOOK
USEFUL
THIS IS A SUPER COOL REFERENCE I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER SEEN A RESOURCE STRUCTURED QUITE LIKE THIS

THIS IS FASTER IF YOU WANT A SPECIFIC ROW INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE TRIANGLE IF YOU WANT THE WHOLE TRIANGLE IT MIGHT BE FASTER TO USE THE PREVIOUS ROW TO CALCULATE THE NEXT ROW
WHY DO YOU NEED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR CODE

WHAT I WOULD DO FIRST IS TO INITIALIZE WITH TWO FIRST ROWS AND SIMPLIFY THE REST
CHEERS FOR THIS IT LOOKS INTERESTING
THANK YOU SO MUCH BROTHER
VERY NICE IT IS GREAT TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE SHARING THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE ABOUT PYTHON

TOO BAD I MISSED THE GIVEAWAY CAN YOU PLEASE SHARE ANOTHER ONE FOR ME

I JUST BOUGHT IT FOR I M REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT PANDAS HAS TO OFFER

I HAVE BEEN USING PANDAS FOR MONTHS NOW BUT IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME HOW MUCH IT CAN DO
LEARNING TO TELL PEOPLE TO FUCK OFF IS A LOST SKILL IN THE OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY MOST FOSS DEV ARE TOO NICE TOO RESPECTFUL AND PC YOU NEED TO LEARN TO SEND PEOPLE GO TO HELL AND REALIZE YOUR LIFE IS YOURS AND YOU DON'T OWN ANYBODY ANYTHING

THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE RESPONSIBILITY YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE RESPECTFUL WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE BUT ANY ASSHOLE DESERVE A SWIFT KICK IN THE BUTT OR BEING IGNORED IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE ENERGY

YOU GIVE A PART OF YOUR LIFE TO MAKE SOMETHING FREE AND GOOD FOR OTHERS DO NOT FEEL GUILTY DO NOT TRY TO ANALYSE IF YOUR BEHAVIOR WAS CORRECT OR NOT THERE IS NO DOUBT TO HAVE HERE RESPECTING YOURSELF IS THE FOUNDATION
AS A CONSUMER OF A OSS PROJECT YOU ARE A GUEST IN SOMEONE HOUSE YOU'D BETTER BEHAVE WHILE YOUR THERE
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND HIS STANCE AND SEE HOW CONTRIBUTING TO A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROJECT COULD LEAD TO THIS KIND OF SITUATION

I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT PYTHON IS NOT OFFICIALLY BACKED BY SOME BIG COMPANIES I MEAN FULL-TIME JUST LIKE NET OR JAVA SOME CORE DEVELOPERS APPEAR TO BE PAID TO WORK ON PYTHON LIKE GUIDO AND SOME COMPANIES APPEAR TO SPONSOR DEVELOPMENT SPRINTS OF PYTHON BUT I GUESS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME SPENT ON PYTHON IS THE RESULT OF VOLUNTEERING
ON THE OTHER HAND JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE TONE DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD IGNORE THE COMMENT FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH IF THE GUY HAS A POINT HE GOT A POINT
FIRST ASK YOURSELF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH PYTHON THEN ASK YOURSELF IF YOU WANT JUST A BOOK A VIDEO COURSE OR SOMETHING MORE INTERACTIVE

SINCE I'VE LEARNED PYTHON AS PART OF DOING NLP RESEARCH I FOUND THE NOLT BOOK A GREAT PLACE TO START BUT IF YOUR GOAL IS NOT NLP IT IS A TERRIBLE PLACE TO START

I ALSO FOUND CS WHERE THEY BUILD A WEB CRAWLER GREAT THEY KEEP CHANGING THEIR WEBSITE SO I'M NOT SURE IF IT IS STILL CALLED AND THEY PROBABLY HAVE SEVERAL NOW

SHORT INFORMATIVE VIDEOS FOLLOWED BY INTERACTIVE PROBLEMS FOLLOWED BY INFORMATIVE EXPLANATION TO SAID PROBLEMS EACH PROBLEM BUILDS ON TOP OF THE LAST ONE AS YOU SLOWLY BUILD A PIECE OF USABLE SOFTWARE NO NEED TO INSTALL ANYTHING AS YOU USE A PYTHON INTERPRETER INSIDE THE BROWSER ONE OF THE BEST WEB COURSES I'VE EVER TRIED
IF PYTHON IS YOUR FIRST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS FANTASTIC
I JUST STARTED ON THIS WEBSITE SO FAR I HAVE LIKED IT HE'S GOT TUTORIALS GOING FROM THE BASICS TO RASPBERRY AND ALL THE WAY TO TENSORFLOW AND AI

I ALREADY HAVE SOME CODING EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK THE BASICS TUTORIALS ARE STILL EASY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND

HAPPY CODING
SOUNDS TERRIFYING I STRUGGLE ON
YOU CAN ALWAYS GET A LAPTOP WITH KEYBOARD SOME BUSINESS MODELS HAVE SUCH PROTECTED KEYBOARDS AS WELL AS UP TO QUAD CPU WITH OTHER GOODIES
I USE PYCHARM CHROME WITH MULTIPLE TABS TERMINALS ON MY MATCHBOOK MY BIGGEST SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT GET A MAC WITH AN SSD OR UPGRADE THE DRIVE YOURSELF AND HAVE AT BARE MINIMUM RAM YOU CAN TUNE THE AVM SETTINGS FOR PYCHARM TO ALLOW USE OF MORE RAM

I HAVEN'T RUN INTO ANY DEBILITATING ISSUES WITH SLUGGISHNESS JUST YET OBVIOUSLY ITS SLOWER ON MY LAPTOP COMPARED TO MY SKYLIKE DESKTOP WITH RAM BUT NOT SO MUCH SLOWER THAT ITS REALLY DETRIMENTAL TO MY WORK
JUDGING BY BENCHMARKS THIS AND THIS THE CPUS ARE ABOUT THE SAME SPEED IN THE NEW MACHINE VS THE OLD ONE HOWEVER THE SUPPORTING TECH LIKE THE SSD AND WHATNOT WILL BE QUICKER
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT THE MATCHBOOK IS MEANT FOR REALLY GOOD PERFORMANCE ON SHORT SPRINTS AND NOT A LONG MARATHON I WOULD SUGGEST YOU EITHER REPLACE IT WITH A PRO MODEL MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE ONE WITHOUT THAT TOTALLY RIDICULOUS TOUCH BAR PROBABLY OR GET YOURSELF ANOTHER AIR MY PRO RUNS A SETUP PRETTY SIMILAR TO YOURS BUT MOST OF MY WORK IS DONE MANAGING A DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR WORKING ON EXCEL AND TWEAKING MACROS EDIT CLARITY
I HAVE THE FIRST GEN MATCHBOOK RETINA THE SLOW ONE BASE MODEL

I DO NOT RUN PYCHARM OR DURANGO HOWEVER I HAVE FAIRLY LARGE FLASK PROJECTS AND USE MACVIM ALONG WITH MYSEL MONGODB AND A FAIR BIT OF CIVY I LIVE WITH A FEW TERMINALS AND SAFARI WINDOWS PLUS ALL MY BACKGROUND GREEKLESS AND NEVER HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH REGARDS TO PERFORMANCE IN DEVELOPMENT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE HAD WITH IT IS SCREEN SIZE BUT THE HASN'T AFFECTED ME ON ANY OF THE PROJECTS I HAVE WORKED ON

I WILL ADMIT HOWEVER IF I COULD DO IT ALL AGAIN WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A PRO FOOT PRINT ISN'T MUCH BIGGER AND NOT SURE HOW LONG THE WILL STAY RELEVANT
I USED TO WORK ON A MBA WORKED FINE FOR ME AND I'M A I WOULD WORRY MORE ABOUT MATCHBOOK PERFORMANCE

THAT SAID I'M NOW USING A MVP AND OH MY GOD IT'S SO MUCH EASIER BUT HEAVIER TO CARRY AROUND
YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO RESEARCH GOOD LAPTOPS FOR HACKINTOSHING I SEE VERY LITTLE PROFESSIONAL VALUE IN THE NEW MATCHBOOKS
SIDE EFFECT MIGHT SUMMON CTHULHU
ARE SOURCEMAPS SUPPORTED
IT WOULD BE AWESOME TO SEE SOME INTEGRATION BETWEEN TRANSCRIPT AND JUPITER NOTEBOOK SOMETIMES IT'S USEFUL TO WRITE SOME JAVASCRIPT BUT IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER TO BE ABLE TO WRITE IT AS PYTHON
OH WOW YOU TRANSLATE PSEUDOCONE INTO PSEUDOCONE

I'D BE MORE IMPRESSED IF YOU WROTE SOMETHING THAT COULD TRANSLATE JAVASCRIPT TO PYTHON WHAT WITH ALL OF THE MINDFUCKERY THAT CAN BE DONE IN JAVASCRIPT

EDIT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS STILL COOL I JUST WONDER WHO THERE IS OUT THERE WHO CAN'T LEARN JAVASCRIPT
I'M SORRY THAT I CAN'T ANSWER DIRECTLY BUT DOES THIS WHY IS MY COMPILER NOT RECOGNIZED HELP
THERE IS NOT API
OH MAN I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT THANKS
FOUNDERS PRODUCING A WEB BASED PRODUCT

I THINK THAT IF YOUR CANDIDATE ACCEPTS THE JOB YOU SHOULDN'T HIRE THEM
CONSIDER SHELLING OUT THE MONEY FOR AN INTERVIEWING RECRUITING SERVICE

THIS PERSON COULD MAKE OR BREAK YOU AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO TECHNICALLY VET THEM

PERHAPS FIND LOCAL EXPERTS IN YOUR AREA AND CONTRACT THEM TO DO THE TECHNICAL INTERVIEW FOR YOU I'D DO IT FOR BEER HONESTLY
NUMBER
TO BE HONEST IT DEPENDS ON THE TECHNOLOGY YOU ARE INTENDING TO USE DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING SPECIFIC IN MIND OR WOULD IT BE UP TO THE DEVELOPER

I WOULD ASK WHAT LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS HE KNOWS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF HIS FAVORITE FRAMEWORK COMPARED TO OTHERS
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROJECTS HE HAS WORKED ON PREVIOUSLY WHAT IS HIS APPROACH TO CODE TESTING

HOW MUCH EXPERIENCE DOES HE HAVE SETTING UP AND HARDENING A SERVER IF HE USES ANY SERVER SIDE LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT PHS HOW DOES HE DEPLOY THE APP DOES HE KNOW HOW TO CONFIGURE AN HETP SERVER LIKE APACHE OR NAGING WHAT IS IS FAVORITE STACK EAST G LAMP DISA MEAN ETC

IF NONE OF YOU HAS ANY TECHNICAL INSIGHT IT IS GONNA BE HARD FOR YOU TO EVALUATE HIS ANSWERS THO I WOULD CONSIDER ASKING SOMEBODY WITH KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD TO SIT IN WITH YOU IN THE INTERVIEW AS A STARTUP GETTING THE WRONG GUY MIGHT BE FATAL

EDIT I JUST REALIZED WE ARE IN THE PYTHON SUBREDDIT A FEW MORE QUESTIONS

WHAT ARE SOME COMMON PYTHON WEB FRAMEWORKS WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF APPROACHES OF DURANGO VS RUBY ON RAILS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES OF PYTHON VS SAY JAVA ASK HIM TO PROGRAM SOMETHING LIKE FIZZBUZZ ASK HIM TO WRITE A SHORT SCRIPT THAT CALCULATES THE SUM OF ALL THE PRIMES LOWER THAN

IF HE HAS MAJOR ISSUE WITH ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS IT MIGHT BE A RED FLAG
I FORGOT ABOUT WXPYTHON OR TINTER WHEN I PICKED PAYT
WHEN YOU SAYS IN STEP NOW COMPILED AND RUN THE PYTHON PROGRAM WHY YOU NEED TO COMPILE
I FORGOT ABOUT WXPYTHON WHEN I COULDN'T WORK OUT HOW TO USE IT WITH PYTHON

IMO THE BIG ONES ARE PAYT CIVY AND TINTER PLUS WHATEVER THAT ONE IS THAT DOES ANDROID IOS THE NAME OF WHICH CURRENTLY ELUDES ME

GREAT PODCAST LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE
PROBABLY THE WORST DAY TO RELEASE THIS
I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A NLP PROJECT WHERE I NEEDED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE SAME WORD TYPICALLY THIS IS DONE BY STEMMING AND LEMMATIZATION THESE METHODS ARE NOT ACCURATE AND I NEEDED HIGH ACCURACY IN MY PROJECT SINCE I FOUND NO LIBRARIES PACKAGES THAT CAN DO THIS I DECIDED TO WRITE A PYTHON PACKAGE MYSELF IT WORKS QUITE WELL NOW FEEL FREE TO CHECK IT OUT I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR FEEDBACK

AWESOME THANKS A LOT I THINK I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT
PYTHON IS A LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS THIS TO HAPPEN

HMM I BET YOU I COULD WRITE A SCRIPT TO AUTOMATE THAT REPEATED PROCESS WE DO HERE IN HR I USED PYTHON FOR A FEW MONTHS BACK IN COLLEGE AND FEEL LIKE I COULD PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER IN A WEEK YOU WON'T HAVE TO HIRE A DEVELOPER OR CONTRACTOR I KNOW THAT YOU'RE AN HR MANAGER NOT AN ENGINEERING MANAGER SO THAT WOULD BE A

AND THEN LATER

WOW THAT SCRIPT CHIP DAPSON WROTE REALLY IS SAVING US SOME TIME I WONDER WHAT ELSE WE CAN AUTOMATE MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER A PART TIME POSITION FOR THIS

AND SO FORTH

ADDING PYTHON TO YOUR BUSINESS IS SO NON-COMMITTAL
I THINK THE 1ST AND 3RD REASONS GROWING COMMUNITY AND UNIVERSITIES TEACHING ARE BASICALLY EFFECT NOT A CAUSE

SIMPLICITY IS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL REASON CAUSE FOR EXPLOSIVE GROWTH AND ADOPTION OF PYTHON

PYTHON IS ELEGANTLY SIMPLE AND SIMPLY ELEGANT

NICE INFO THOUGH THANKS
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE THEY TAUGHT US C AND I GOT A BUT DIDN'T BECOME A PROGRAMMER I PICKED UP PYTHON A YEAR AGO AND AM NOW REGULARLY USING MY SCRIPTS AT WORK IN A DEPARTMENT THAT HAS COME TO RELY ON THEM WISH I GOT MORE INTO IT YEARS AGO
I SEE PYTHON HAS GROWN QUICKLY FOR DIFFERENT REASONS

THE REPL THE LOOP THERE'S ANOTHER POPULAR LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWED US TO DO THIS MUCH THE SAME WAY BASIC IF YOU'RE A THE REPL IS SUPER IMPORTANT FOR QUICKLY FIGURING OUT HOW TO CODE AS SUCH BOTH LANGUAGES HAVE HAD QUITE A LONG RUN OF POPULARITY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN EASY FOR PEOPLE TO PICK UP AND TRY OUT

2 LOTS OF LIBRARIES I THINK XKCD SUMMARIZED IT BEST HERE GUY BUT HOW ARE YOU FLYING GUY 2 I JUST TYPED IMPORT ANTIGRAVITY

THE HYPE TRAIN FOR ANYTHING TO REALLY SUCCEED THERE HAS TO BE AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT OF CHEERLEADING AT THE RISK OF BEING DOWNVOTED I'M GONNA SAY THAT PYTHON HAS A BIT OF THE HYPE TRAIN THING GOING ON

DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME PYTHON IS A REALLY GOOD LANGUAGE THAT I CODE IN ALMOST EVERY DAY HYPE ISN'T A BAD THING YOU NEED JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP THINGS INTERESTING

OR MAYBE I SHOULD SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH CONTINUAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE LANGUAGE AND A WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE VERSION AND FORMAL TYPE HINTING FINALLY THAT MAKES PYTHON SOMETHING YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN INVEST YOURSELF IN

NOW IF ONLY WE COULD GET THE PYTHON LOVERS TO FINALLY COME OVER TO PYTHON


FOR ME IT WAS JUST THAT BLENDER HAD A BUILT-IN PYTHON INTERPRETER DAE
TO ALL PEOPLE IN THIS THREAD COMMENTING ON PYTHONS QUICK GROWTH

REMEMBER PYTHON IS YEARS OLD OLDER THAN JAVA OLDER THAN PHS OLDER THAN JAVASCRIPT CAME OUT YEARS AGO

I'VE BEEN USING IT AROUND YEARS IT'S HAD EXPLOSIVE GROWTH AT LEAST TWICE AROUND DURANGO WEB DEV THEN BIOINFORMATICS WHICH SORT OF MERGED GREW INTO LARGER SNIPY PHENOMENON
I'M WORKING ON MY NEXT LITTLE PROJECT EXCLUSIVELY IN MY HR TO FRO COMMUTE TIME CODING USING PYTHON ON AN IPHONE

DOESN'T GET SIMPLER THAN THAT

PYTHON TO ME IS NATURAL AND SUPER QUICK TO GET TO FROM ZERO TO
USABILITY IN DATA SCIENCE

2 ACCESSIBILITY IN DATA SCIENCE

JOBS IN DATA SCIENCE
I THINK THIS IS JUST GREAT I'M AN EXPERIENCED PHS DEVELOPER BY TRADE BUT OVERALL IT SEEMS THAT PYTHON IS A MUCH BETTER LANGUAGE COMMUNITY I EVEN ATTEMPTED TO SWITCH MY CAREER TO PYTHON BEFORE BUT GOT PULLED BACK IN TO PHS
SNIPY
2 BUMPY
NOLT

THE PYTHON LANGUAGE IS EASY TO ROK AND PRETTY EASY TO GET INTO THE ABOVE LIBRARIES HAVE GOT TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON POPULARITY A WHOLE GENERATION OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE DISCOVERED CLUSTERING I MEAN MACHINE LEARNING AND THE THREE LIBRARIES ABOVE MAKE IT APPROACHABLE FOR PROGRAMMERS
YOU CAN CONCENTRATE IN WHAT THE CODE DOES INSTEAD OF HAVE I WRITTEN IT CORRECTLY CHANGES THE FOCUS FROM ITS GRAMMAR TO ITS USEFULNESS
LIVE DEMO HERE

NOTE IT'S A TEST CHANNEL UNMODERATED SO YOU CAN EXPECT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN THERE PEOPLE CLAIMING TO BE ANYONE OR ME AND SAYING S T

ANOTHER LIVE DEMO IN CASE THE FIRST IS BROKEN
EASY TO INSTALL

NOPE PLEASE LEARN ABOUT SO THE USER CAN DO PIP INSTALL EAST TO INSTALL THE PROJECT WITH ITS DEPENDENCIES OR AT LEAST PUT THE DEPENDENCIES INTO AS IT'S USUAL FOR PYTHON PROJECTS
HI I HAVE A QUESTION CAN I IMPLEMENT IT INTO WEB APPLICATIONS LIKE FOR PERSONAL WEBSITES OR BLOGS GOOD JOB ON THIS PROJECT

DELETED
BUT WHAT IS HELPFUL ARE THE FEW REALLY GOOD DECISION TREES THAT YOU ALSO GENERATED ALONG WITH THE BAD ONES

YOU WOULDN'T CALL ANY INDIVIDUAL TREE PER SE WRONG OR RIGHT WHAT MATTERS IS THAT AVERAGING OVER THEM WILL YIELD GOOD RESULTS YOU MENTION SOMETHING SIMILAR LATER ON BUT THIS SENTENCE IS JUST WRONG

I DO AGREE THAT IT IS VERY USEFUL AND IT IS USUALLY THE FIRST MODEL I TRY ALONGSIDE A LINEAR ONE
I WOULD RECOMMEND USING A RANDOM SEED FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REPRODUCE THE RESULTS EAST G HERE IT'S USED FOR THE BOOTSTRAP SAMPLING FEATURE SUBSAMPLING AND
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN OR POINT ME TO A SIMPLE REAL LIFE EXAMPLE WHERE IT SOLVES ACTUAL REAL LIFE PROBLEM ALL I CAN FIND IS OVERLOADED WITH ABSTRACTIONS WITHOUT EXPLAINING WHAT DATA WE PUT INTO ALGORITHM AND WHY
IS IT ME OR IS THERE SOMETHING WEIRD GOING ON IN THIS IMAGE
GO TO R LEARNPYTHON
2 SEE THE BUMPY DOCS EAST G
I MUST ADMIT I ALREADY LIKE THIS BECAUSE OF THE HOME PAGE AND I HAVEN'T EVEN FIGURED OUT WHAT IT IS YET NICE WORK

EDIT THOUGH THE DOCS FOR ITSELF ARE A LITTLE TOO FAR NESTED I MEAN SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL PAGES COULD EASILY BE JOINED TOGETHER FEELS LIKE TRYING TO NAVIGATE A JUNGLE
SORRY FOR THE INCOMPLETE ANSWER BUT COULD BE USEFUL HERE PERHAPS YOU COULD BUCKET THE ENTRIES BY MONTH OR WEEK AND THEN FIND THE WORDS WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES FOR EACH BUCKET

WIKI T
DEPENDING ON WHAT DATA IS CAPTURED IN THIS JOURNAL YOU COULD LOOK AT TRENDS IN WORDS PER POST PROBABLY AT A MIN NUM CHARS TIME RANGES THAT YOU POST WRITE REFERENCES BY CATEGORY WORK SIGNIFICANT OTHERS MENTAL STATE ETC BY ASSOCIATING CERTAIN WORDS TO THOSE CATEGORIES
YOU COULD ALSO JUST USE YOUR BROWSER HISTORY TO ANSWER THAT FOR YOU
IF THIS IS A LONG-TERM PROJECT I RECOMMEND LOOKING INTO IN EMACS IT IS EXTREMELY GOOD AT BOTH CAPTURING AND PREPARING INTO AN ANALYTICAL FORM THESE KINDS OF THINGS LOTS OF THESE FEATURES ARE MADE SIMPLER MORE COHESIVE UNDER ITS FRAMEWORK SINCE IT'S ALL PLAIN TEXT YOU STILL HAVE PYTHON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LEARN ALISP TO ANALYZE YOUR COLLECTIONS
SENTIMENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS WOULD BE GOOD I'M NOT SURE OF ANY PYTHON PACKAGES I'M AFRAID I DON'T ANALYSE THIS KIND OF DATA BUT I'D BE SURPRISED IF THERE WEREN'T ANY

A BIT BASIC BUT A WORD CLOUD
WHAT PROGRAM ARE YOU USING FOR YOUR ONLINE DIARY
SAYING THAT A TUPLE IS LIKE A LIST IN ONE OF THE FIRST FEW SENTENCES IS VERY CONFUSING
HOLDS DIFFERENT IMMUTABLE OBJECTS
NOPE IS ITSELF IMMUTABLE EXAMPLE YOU PUT A DICT INSIDE A TUPLE AND THE DICT CAN STILL CHANGE
ARE THERE ANY MORE DETAILS MAYBE IT COULD UNDERSTAND PANDAS DATAFRAMES
JUST ANNOUNCED AT

I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT

I WAS WONDERING IF THIS BOOK WAS SOMETHING I COULD GIVE TO A FRIEND THAT WANTED TO START PROGRAMMING AND MY CONCLUSION WAS THAT IT'S NOT

IT'S A DECENT BOOK IF YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM AND IS CURIOUS ABOUT PYTHON BUT NOT MUCH HELP IN LEARNING PROGRAMMING ITSELF
THANKS
THANKS I ALSO GOT YOUR OTHER BOOK PYTHON
OP GOOD GUY
DAMN I BOUGHT PYTHON WHEN PYTHON WAS FREE

THANK YOU
HAS ANYONE HERE READ OR REVIEWED THIS FREE BOOKS MOST OFTEN AREN'T VERY GOOD
IF YOU HAVE AN OPEN SOURCE PYTHON PROJECT YOU CAN DISPLAY YOUR DOWNLOAD STATISTICS ON GITHUB BY HOSTING THIS FLASK APP ON HEROKU AND LINKING TO IT FROM YOUR READE

DOWNLOAD STATS
WELL NOW YOU HAVE ENOUGH GRASP OF THE LANGUAGE TO WRITE SOMETHING SO FIND A PERSONAL PROJECT TO EXPLORE AND GO AHEAD IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FANCY OR OR JUST SOMETHING YOU THINK YOU MAY USE AND THEN WRITE IT IN PYTHON
BUILD A PROJECT SOMETHING MEANINGFUL THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND THAT YOU'D BE HAPPY TO SHOW TO A POTENTIAL EMPLOYER AS A PART OF YOUR PORTFOLIO WHEN YOU'VE DONE A FEW OF THESE FEEL FREE TO ASK FOR HELP OR REVIEWS HERE YOU CAN START THROWING YOUR RESUME AND PORTFOLIO AT COMPANIES TO SEE WHO WILL BITE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF DEMAND OUT THEIR FOR CAPABLE PROGRAMMERS AND NOTHING IS BETTER EVIDENCE OF YOUR CAPABILITY THAN PROJECTS DONE WELL

I'D SUGGEST CREATING A GITHUB ACCOUNT GETTING FAMILIAR WITH GIT AND LOOK INTO CREATING AND HOSTING SOME BASIC WEB PROJECTS WITH PAGES FOR FREE MAYBE THERE ARE SOME SMALL BUSINESSES NEAR YOU THAT YOU COULD HELP OUT BY CREATING SOMETHING THAT INTEGRATES WITH EMAIL OR MAPS OR SPREADSHEETS OR ETC

FIRST THIS IS A VERY GOOD TALK AND HE MAKES A NUMBER OF VALID POINTS

THE REASON THE TALK ITSELF WAS UNCLEAR IN MANY RESPECTS IS THAT THE PROBLEM HE'S TALKING ABOUT EXPOSING INTERNALS IS ALSO A POWERFUL ADVANTAGE ALLOWING US TO IMPLEMENT THINGS IN PYTHON WHICH WOULD BE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT FROM THE DYNAMIC SIDE OF OTHER LANGUAGES HE HIMSELF CLEARLY USES THESE INTERNALS TO ADVANTAGE IN HIS OWN CODE AND ENJOYS THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY OFFER HE ALSO BEMOANS THAT EXPOSING THOSE INTERFACES MAKES THE UNDERLYING INTERPRETER DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THESE INTERFACES ARE CLEARLY A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT
WE USE SPHINX IT WORKS AND IS FINE THAT'S KINDA ALL I HAVE TO SAY THERE

I DO WISH WERE HAD SETTLED UPON GOOGLE STYLE PYTHON DOC STRINGS I HATE USING ARST MARKUP

I MEAN WHY USE USE MARKUP TO FORMAT DOC STRINGS AND SUCH WHEN YOU CAN USE WHITESPACE ITS PYTHON DAMN IT

I HAVE TRIED TO BUILD SOME TOOL THAT DOWNLOADS AND VISUALIZES BOUNDARY DATA MYSELF BEFORE BUT I HAD PROBLEMS TO GET COMPLETE AND CONSISTENT DATA FOR A SPECIFIC BOUNDING BOX

I'M GLAD YOU MADE THIS WILL CHECK IT OUT TOMORROW

EDIT I HAD SOME ISSUES INSTALLING FIONA ADAL UNDER WINDOWS BUT ONCE I GOT IT RUNNING IT IS PRETTY COOL THIS IMAGE SHOWS A RADIAL STREET NETWORK OF HAMBURG WITH A RADIUS OF AROUND THE CENTER POINT WITH ONLY LINES OF CODE OF COURSE THIS IS ONLY ARTISTIC BUT THE NODES AND EDGES ARE AVAILABLE IN A NETWORK GRAPH TO WORK ON

SOME THINGS SHOULD BE NOTED AS THE KEYWORD ARGUMENTS ARE SOMETIMES NOT AS STATED IN THAT ARTICLE FOR INSTANCE TYPE IS AND DIST IS DISTANCE

I CAN'T WAIT TO HOPEFULLY SEE A NICE DOCUMENTATION SOON IT WOULD ALSO BE REALLY COOL TO HAVE SOME MORE BUILT-IN ATTRIBUTES OF STREETS TO USE OR PLOT THE ACTUAL BOUNDARY ALONG THE STREET NETWORK

DUDE THIS IS AWESOME
HI GEOFF
THIS LOOKS REALLY INTERESTING
GONNA TRY IT WHEN I AM AT HOME
NOW TRAVELING

THANK YOU THIS IS AMAZING
CAN WE EXPORT THE DATA IN GEOJSON FORMAT IF NOT WOULD YOU ADD THIS FEATURE IN THE FUTURE
IN CASE ANYONE HERE KNOWS

I HAVE AN ANACONDA DISTRIBUTION INSTALLED ON MY PC BUMPY SNIPY MATPLOTLIB ETC ETC DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW I WOULD GO ABOUT INSTALLING THIS PACKAGE INTO MY EXISTING DISTRIBUTION IF I TRY TO DO IT WITH CONDA IT DOESN'T KNOW THIS PACKAGE IF I TRY PIP IT GIVES ME AN ERROR MESSAGE I'M ALSO NOT SURE WHETHER PIP WORKS WELL WITH CONDA

THIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS

LEARNT USING CSF MODULE
LEARNT THE BASICS OF MATPLOTLIB AND GPCHARTS WROTE A FEW PRACTICE GRAPHS OF CSF DATA I GOT FROM WORLDBANK DAMN THOSE POPULATION CHANGE GRAPHS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ARE INTERESTING
BASICS OF BEAUTIFULSOUP AND SCRAPPED A CHINESE NOVEL WEBSITE THEY ONLY PROVIDE BOOKS IN CHAPTERS SO I HAD TO COPY PASTE EVERY BOOK I WAS ABOUT TO READ I LIKE READING FROM MY KINDLE CONCLUSION PYTHON USEFUL FOR EVERYDAY LIFE
LEARNT SOME FLASK STARTED WORKING ON A BLOG NOT TOO PRACTICE BUT I ACTUALLY WANT TO START BLOGGING
GOT ANNOYED OF DB DUNNO WHY WHILE USING FLASK AND AM TAKING A LOOK AT TINYDB LOOKS VERY REASONABLE SO FAR
ALSO PUT A SIMPLE WP WEBSITE TOGETHER FOR A CLIENT HATE IT PYTHON IS WAY MORE FUN

I AM WORKING ON SENDING COMMANDS TO ARDUINOS VIA SERIAL BASED ON ABOX CONTROLLER READINGS IN ORDER TO CONTROL AND UNDERWATER ROK
I'M WORKING ON A SIMPLE WEB APP FOR MANAGING BILLS CURRENTLY TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND CUSTOM WIDGETS AND FIELDS FOR WTFORMS
WORKING ON A LITTLE STATIC WEBSITE THAT IS PRETTY MUCH A AURATED LIST OF WHAT CAN AND CANNOT PET RATS EAT

AS A RAT OWNER I'M HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THIS SUBJECT THE INFORMATION IS SCATTERED AROUND IN VARIOUS FORUM POSTS ARTICLES AND WEIRD WEBSITES SO MY GOAL IS TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE

I DECIDED TO USE PELICAN STATIC PAGE GENERATION AND GITHUB PAGES AS HOSTING
MAJORITY OF THE TECHNICAL WORK WENT INTO MAKING THE THEME WHICH WAS SURPRISINGLY EASY I'M NOT A FRONTED ENGINEER BUT JINJA 2 IS JUST SO FUN TO WORK WITH

THE OTHER PART BEING THE CONTENT ITSELF I THOUGHT OF USING WEBSCRAPING TO SCRAPE THOSE POSTS AND GENERATE THE MARKDOWN FILES FOR PELICAN BUT THE POSTS AND ARTICLES DON'T HAVE CLEAR STRUCTURE AND LOTS OF INFORMATION NEED TO BE RESEARCHED ANYWAYS SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH
THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST TIME CONSUMING PART THE CONTENT ITSELF

ALL THAT BEING SAID IT'S QUITE FUN LITTLE PROJECT THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE OF USE TO SOMEONE
TRYING TO FIND TIME TO CONTINUE WRITING MY ASYNC API WRAPPER BUT WITH SCHOOL IT'S HARD
I'M BUILDING A FRAMEWORK FOR CREATING SGI REST API APPLICATIONS THE MAIN REASON OF WHY I'M DOING IT IS BECAUSE I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT BIGGER FRAMEWORKS LIKE FLASK AND DURANGO ARE DEALING ONE DAY MAYBE I WILL BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE WITH THEM

A SILLY LITTLE FLASK WEB API FOR A UNITY 3D GAME TO CONNECT TO FOR DOWNLOADING PROCEDURAL ENEMY DATA FROM THE INTERNET I'LL ALSO EVENTUALLY BE DOING A UNITY 3D PACKAGE WITH BUILT IN BEHAVIOUR SCRIPTS FOR VARIOUS ATTRIBUTES THE API CAN SERVE

CREDIT FOR ALL OF THE ENEMY VARIATIONS GOES TO U CARMICHAEL

EXAMPLE ENEMY

MOVEMENT TYPE WALL FOLLOWING
ABILITY EXPLODING
TRIGGER PROXIMITY TO PLAYER

THE IDEA IS THAT EVENTUALLY A GAME DEV WILL BE ABLE TO SAY EITHER GETRANDOMENEMYSET COUNT OR GETENEMYSET ID AND THEN CREATE A SPECIFICALLY TAILORED SET OF ENEMIES ON MY SITE WITH COMBINATIONS OF ATTRIBUTES WHICH CAN BE ALTERED WITHOUT PATCHING A GAME FOR CUSTOMIZATION OF CONTENTION

WHY NOT SURE
A SIMPLE GAME OF HANGMAN AND I'M FAILING
HEY I'VE STARTED PYTHON FOUR DAYS AGO GOOD
WORKING ON WRITING A MUTATION TESTING SYSTEM HOPEFULLY NICER THAN THE EXISTING ONES AT LEAST LESS COMPLEX BASED ON BARON
THE PYTHON FLIGHT MECHANICS ENGINE PHYFE I TALKED ABOUT IN A POST YESTERDAY
I'VE JUST STARTED LEARNING PYTHON I'M VERY EXCITED
I THINK EXACTLY THE SAME THING I HATE ADDING A DEPENDANCY JUST FOR A SMALL THING EVEN IF I'M THE AUTHOR OF THE REQUIRED PACKAGE

FOR THIS REASON I LOVE PACKAGES JUST COPY A SINGLE PY FILE IN YOUR PROJECT SOURCE TREE AND THAT'S IT IF YOU WANT TO UPDATE IT JUST DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN IF YOU NEED THAT PACKAGE IN ANOTHER PROJECT IT'S ONLY ONE CP COMMAND AWAY IT COULDN'T BE EASIER

OBVIOUSLY THIS APPLIES ONLY TO HELPER PACKAGES AS YOU SAY


CONCERNS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
I FEEL LIKE THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE VERY STRICT GUIDELINES TO DEFINE WHAT CONSTITUTES A BUG FIX OR A NEW FEATURE BY THAT I MEAN HOW MUCH ARE THESE SNIPPETS ALLOWED TO CHANGE WHAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO ADD A KEYWORD TO A UTILITY FUNCTION SHOULD THAT BE MADE IN TO A NEW SNIPPET

EVEN IF YOU SAY THE SNIPPETS WOULD NEVER BE THAT BIG HOW BIG IS TOO BIG BEFORE THE CODE DOESN'T BELONG ON THE SITE

COOL IDEA THOUGH
A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS

I THINK THAT ADDING ANOTHER REPOSITORY MANAGER DOESN'T REDUCE DEPENDENCIES IT JUST SPLITS THE DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN TWO MANAGERS EVENTUALLY MAKING THINGS MORE COMPLEX NO MATTER HOW SIMPLE YOUR REPOSITORY WILL BE AS ALREADY SUGGESTED HERE IT IS BEST TO KEEP THINGS SIMPLE EITHER USE ESTABLISHED PACKAGE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OR JUST THE CODE SNIPPETS YOU OTHERWISE GET YOURSELF INTO TONS OF PROBLEMS THAT WERE ALREADY SOLVED SUCH VERSION MANAGEMENT EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES YOU CANNOT AVOID SUCH AS THE PYTHON VERSION ACCESS MANAGEMENT ETC

IF YOU FEEL YOU DO NEED A PRIVATE MANAGED REPOSITORY THE BEST IMHO WILL PROBABLY BE A PRIVATE PEPI SERVER IF YOUR MAIN FOCUS IS MANAGING YOUR PRIVATE INVENTORY AS A SEPARATE LAYER THEN THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF READY SOLUTIONS SUCH AS PIESHOP WHICH I PERSONALLY DIDN'T TRY BUT LOOKS PRETTY WELL DOCUMENTED


THERE'S NO REASON TO SEE DEPENDENCIES AS A BAD THING I DON'T CARE HOW SMALL IT IS MUCH BETTER TO USE A MODULAR APPROACH THAN CREATE MONOLITHS OF CODE
THIS IS AWESOME THANKS
MAYBE FOR THE DIBAI PEP SECTION SHOW HOW TO USE PARAMETERS
SQLALCHEMY DOESN'T SEEM THAT DIFFICULT THANKS FOR THE TUTORIAL
FROM WHAT I REMEMBER READING ABOUT GAMING IN PYTHON IS THAT PREGAME IS GOOD FOR BASICS BUT PEGLET MAY BE BETTER SOURCE HOWEVER I WOULD STICK TO UNITY SINCE I THINK THE COMMUNITY MAY BE A LOT BIGGER FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE GAMES
I KNOW THE UNITY ENGINE USES C SO I CAST MY VOTE FOR COUNTY
I WOULD STICK WITH C FOR GAME DEVELOPMENT THOUGH I LOVE PYTHON
PANDA 3D IS ALMOST YEAR OLD PROJECT USED BY SOME COMMERCIAL GAMES IT IS SUPPORTED BY DISNEY AND CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY CORE WRITTEN IN C AND GAME ENGINE EXPOSED IN PYTHON

MANUAL FEATURES
UNITY 3D IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANYTHING IN THE PYTHON ENVIRONMENT FOR MAKING GAMES THAT YOU SHOULD STICK WITH COUNTY
IF YOU ARE SURE THAT YOU WANT TO PROGRAM GAMES THEN C UNITY SEEMS TO BE THE WAY TO GO IT'S ALSO A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU PREFER LINUX OR WINDOWS AS MOST PYTHON DEVELOPMENT IS DONE ON LINUX AND C WORKS BEST WITH WINDOWS

BY THE WAY THERE IS NO NEED TO CHOOSE ONE YOU CAN LEARN BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THIS WAY YOU WILL BE A MUCH STRONGER PROGRAMMER AS WELL
I'M CONTEMPLATING DOING PYTHON GAMES IN PAYT WELL CONTEMPLATING IT WHENEVER I START WRITING ANYTHING I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE JUST GONE STRAIGHT QT PYTHON JUST ISN'T GOOD FOR MULTIPROCESSING
EVE ONLINE IS BUILT IN PYTHON
YOU CAN CERTAINLY MAKE GAMES IN PYTHON THERE IS A PYTHON GAME JAM CALLED PYWEEK THAT JUST WRAPPED UP AND YOU CAN CHECK OUT SOME OF THE ENTRIES HERE

GAMES LIKE POKEMON OR ZELDA 2 ARE EASILY DOABLE
IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO PROFESSIONAL GAME DEVELOPMENT I THINK C IS THE BEST WAY TO GO IF YOU HAVE YOUR HEART SET ON UNITY I WOULD GO WITH COUNTY
WELL THERE'S THIS

I'VE NEVER TOUCHED C BUT I ALSO TEND TO AVOID MICROSOFT SOFTWARE BEING A LINUX GUY
THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING ANALYSIS AND I APPRECIATE HOW COMPLETELY YOU DOCUMENTED EVERY BIT OF YOUR WORK
WHY DID YOU USE WORD CLOUDS IN YOUR ANALYSIS
I CREATED A TORRENT UPLOAD SCRIPT
IF INPUT IS A TORRENT FILE POSTS THE FILE TO MY TRANSMISSION SERVER AT HOME
IF INPUT IS A WEBPAGE LOOKS FOR THE FIRST MAGNET LINK ON THE PAGE AND POSTS THAT TO MY TRANSMISSION SERVER

PYTHONISSA SCRIPTS CAN BE LOADED VIA THE APP EXTENSION SHARE SHEET MECHANISM SO I CAN SIMPLY FIND A TORRENT OR MAGNET LINK TAP OPEN IN SHARE AND RUN MY SCRIPTURE
I MUST NOT BE USING IT TO ITS FULLEST BUT ON MY COMMUTE THERE'S A LONG OLD TUNNEL WHERE I HAVE ZERO ATE ACCESS AND I USE THAT TIME TO BLOCK OUT CODE FOR WORK OR JUST PLAY WITH NEW THINGS I'VE LEARN IN THE STD LIBRARY
DOES EXIST A SIMILAR APP FOR ANDROID I ALREADY KNOW PYTHON BUT IT ISN'T SO LINKED TO PHONE ENVIRONMENT
NOT REALLY A PROJECT BUT I'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH PROJECT EULER PROBLEMS WHEN I HAVE A FEW MINUTES HERE AND THERE HAVE LEARNED QUITE A BIT

ALSO MADE A LITTLE WEB SCRAPER THAT WOULD GET MY ACCOUNT BALANCE FOR OUR CAFETERIA WHERE WE GOT A SET AMOUNT OF FREE MONEY FOR FOOD EVERY FEW MONTHS WHICH I FIGURE COMES FROM MY TUITION THE SCRIPT WOULD PRINT OUT THE BALANCE AVERAGE SPENDING PER TIME AND WHETHER I SHOULD EAT MORE OR LESS TO LAST THE FULL TIME BUT NOT HAVE ANY LEFT OVER
I LEARNED USING DURANGO DOCS I STARTED OFF THERE CREATING THE TUTORIAL PROJECT THEN WORKED ON CREATING A MOCK RESTAURANT SEARCH ENGINE

IF YOU ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH PYTHON THE DOCS SHOULD HELP YOU GET A LONG WAY THERE
LOOKING FOR THIS
NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN PLEASE ELABORATE
DAMN THAT'S UGLY
SO YOU KNOW WHAT LINKEDIT IS
CHECK AND SEE IF THERE IS A LYCON COMING UP IN YOUR AREA IT IS A GREAT PLACE TO DO NETWORKING SPECIFICALLY FOR PYTHON
DDK WHY YOU ASK WITH CLIENTS SURE JUST DELIVER GOOD STUFF AND KEEP THEIR CONTACT INFO I'M CASE I NEED SOMETHING OR WANT TO OFFER MY SERVICES WITH COWORKERS BE DECENT AND KEEP THEIR CONTACT INFO TOO

2 EASY
DID YOU CROSS-POST

R STARTUPS COMMENTS

R STARTUPS IS CLEARLY A BETTER CHOICE FOR THIS TYPE OF QUESTION
I HAVE SOME SORTING ALGORITHMS IN PYTHON I IMPLEMENTED A WHILE AGO IF IT HELPS YOU MAY WANT TO ADD TIMSORT TO YOUR LIST

ANFEDERICO
IF YOU PULL FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES AND DON'T WANT TO RECREATE THOSE SOURCES JUST CREATE A COLLECTION WITH A DICTIONARY IE

SETTINGS

THIS ABSTRACTS THE UNDERLYING WHERE IS THE KEY LOGIC AND YOUR PROGRAM JUST HAS TO WORRY ABOUT LOOKING UP A VALUE FROM A PLACE THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOUR PROGRAM

THEN READ THE SIDEBAR
YOU COULD MAKE A FILE LIKE

OR HARDCODED VALUE
OR HARDCODED VALUE

IF THOSE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AREN'T SET THEN THOSE KEYS WILL BE SET TO HARDCODED VALUE OR WHATEVER THE USER PUTS THERE THEN IMPORT THE CONFIT IN YOUR OTHER FILES EAST G


FROM CONFIT IMPORT

AGS
COOL ARE THERE OTHER SIMULATIONS LIKE THIS FOR WEATHER FOR EXAMPLE
COULD THIS BE USEFUL FOR HIGH POWERED ROCKETRY
THIS IS REALLY EXCELLENT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN API LIKE THIS FOR A WHILE FORGIVE THE AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS

HOW ACCURATE ARE THE CALCULATIONS
THE FUNCTIONALITY WHAT INTERVAL OF TIME DOES THIS STEP
THE BINDER EXAMPLE FAILS HAVE YOU GOT ANY OTHER EXAMPLES RUNNING
I WAS HOPING FOR A GETTING STARTED GUIDE AT LEAST FOR BASIC CODE BOOT AND HELLO WORLD
WHAT'S YOUR TARGET PURPOSE AND PLATFORM
I NOTICE SOME OF YOUR DOCS ARE SPANISH WILL YOU BE TRANSLATING THEM SOON ALTHOUGH GOOGLE TRANSLATE DOES A GREAT JOB

THANKS IN ADVANCE THIS IS AWESOME I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT
PROBABLY BELONGS ON R LEARNPYTHON BUT AS I'M FEELING CHARITABLE I'D START WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS EASYGUI
TINTER TRY IT
I'M ALREADY USING KINKER BUT THANKS

THE MAIN QUESTIONS I HAVE IS WHEN I IMPORT THE MODULE IT DISPLAYS THE WINDOW HOW DO I PREVENT THIS

THE CODE IS SIMPLE FROM MODULENAME IMPORT AND THIS CAUSES THE WINDOW TO LOAD
SCAN GITHUB ETC FOR ASW KEYS GAIN ACCESS MINE BISCOTIN UNTIL SHUTDOWN WAS RINSE AND REPEAT

I DON'T DO THIS BUT IT'S A COMMON SCHEME HAPPENED TO SOME FRIENDS WHO PUSHED THEIR KEYS
PLEASE DEFINE BOTS
I WROTE A GREAT BOT TO TRY AND SKIM BOT IDEAS ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES
I'M NOT A DEVELOPER OR ANYTHING CLOSE BUT IF I HAD AN IDEA THAT I WAS USING TO MAKE MONEY I WOULDN'T EXACTLY POST SAID IDEA ONLINE
THE ONE AND ONLY BOT I HAVE WRITTEN WAS AN IRC BOTANY ALSO IT WASN'T FOR ANY FORM OF PROFIT JUST TO TEACH ME SOCKET PROGRAMMING
SOME OF THE BOTS I HAVE WRITTEN BUT NOT MAKING ANY MONEY

GOODREADS BOT FOR REDDIN WHICH POWERS U GOODREADSBOT SOURCE

RECENTLY WROTE A WELCOME BOT FOR SLACK TEAMS SOURCE

NOT A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER BUT PROFESSIONALS WILL OFTEN AUTOMATE TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT ALSO AUTOMATED SCALING IS IMMEDIATELY IMPORTANT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR DATA CENTER BY AUTOMATING SCALING IN ASW OR THE LIKE YOU CAN PAY FOR ONLY THE SERVICE THAT YOU USE RATHER THEN HAVING TO FUND THE COST FOR AN ARRAY OF MACHINES WHETHER YOU NEED THEM OR NOT THESE THINGS MIGHT NOT EXACTLY BE DOING THE ACTUAL ACT OF MAKING THE MONEY BUT THEY CAN SURE AS HELL HELP YOU SAVE A SHIPLOAD OF TIME AND MONEY AND HEADACHE

JUST AS FAR AS ACTUALLY MAKING YOU MONEY YOU COULD PROBABLY AUTOMATE A SCRIPT TO COMPLETE CERTAIN TYPES OF TASKS ON AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT BE BREACHING THEIR TOS IF YOU DO
DELETED
NOBODY IS GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT KIND OF BOT THEY WROTE IF THEY ARE MAKING MONEY THAT SAID YOU REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A BUSINESS SENSE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU CAN MAKE PROFIT WITH A BOTANY THERE ARE COUNTLESS INDUSTRIES THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM AUTOMATION TOOLING AND YOU CAN EITHER CARVE THE WAY YOURSELF OR FIND A STRATEGIC PARTNER COMPANY TYPICALLY THOUGH YOU CAN'T REALLY MAKE A BOT THAT WILL JUST RUN AND MAKE MONEY YOU WILL LIKELY HAVE TO AWEEK IT OR INCORPORATE SOME MANUAL PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT IT RUNS SMOOTHLY AND CORRECTLY
I USED TO HAVE A STEAM MARKET BOT THAT WOULD BUY ITEMS FROM PEOPLE THAT PUT THEM BY MISTAKE CHEAPER THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE NOT ANYMORE THO STEAM KILLED THAT WITH BUY ORDERS
I'VE MADE TEXT GENERATION BOTS IN LESS THAN A WEEK TO TEST IT OUT USING PYTHON THEY ARE EARNING A CONSISTENT TWENTY USD A MONTH WITH NO MANUAL INVOLVEMENT SIXTH MONTH IN I'D PUT MORE TIME INTO IT BUT I'M BUSY WITH MY DAY JOB IN PUBLIC RELATIONS

I DON'T WANT TO REVEAL MUCH MORE NATURALLY AS THIS POST SEEMS LIKE A WAY TO FISH FOR IDEAS BUT IF YOU NEED HELP YOU CAN REACH OUT TO ME
WROTE A BOT TO ARBITRAGE CRYPTO CURRENCY EXCHANGES IT MAKES PENNIES A DAY PENNIES SOME DAYS THOUGH IT DOES A LOT BETTER THE VOLATILITY OF THE CURRENCIES USUALLY MAKE IT A WASH IN THE END IF I HAD MORE TIME AND INTEREST I'M SURE IT COULD DO BETTER
I WROTE U UNKNOWNVIDEOSMOD BOT AND IT IS GOING INCREDIBLY WELL ON R UNKNOWNVIDEOS
I BUILT A WEBSITE HETP

IT IS A BUSINESS NAME GENERATOR MY PLAN WAS TO APPLY MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO THE GENERATOR TO FIND THE BEST NAMES UNFORTUNATELY I ONLY LEARNED LATER THAT MACHINE LEARNING PERFORMS TERRIBLY ON NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING THE SITE IS LUCKY TO GET VISITOR IN A DAY
I WROTE A BOT SCRIPT TO SPELLCHECK WEBSITES IF A PARTICULAR WORD MEDICAL TERMS LAST NAMES BUSINESS BRANDS ETC IS NOT IN THE DEFAULT DICTIONARY IT USES GOOGLE SEARCH AS A API TO DOUBLE-CHECK IT IF IT IS NOT IN THE DEFAULT DICTIONARY BUT THE WORD IS SPELLED CORRECTLY IT IS APPENDED TO AN EVER-GROWING TXT FILE ALL MISSPELLED WORDS THEIR CORRESPONDING BURLS ARE EXPORTED INTO A XLSX FILE IT ISN'T FOR PROFIT BUT I DO USE IT OFTEN FOR WORK
DELETED
I'VE HAD NO PROBLEMS USING PYVENV FOR MY VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT SAID IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO HANDLE ANY PROBLEMS THAT COULD ARISE THEN I WOULD HOLD UPGRADING UNTIL YOU DO
I THINK I AM RUNNING THE MOST UP TO DATE VERSION OF SIERRA NO ISSUES SO FAR
POST
SO THE POST IS MOSTLY A FOLLOW UP AND SUM UP OF A DISCUSSION THAT OCCURRED HERE

AS THE AUTHOR OF PENDULUM I ADMITTED IN THE END THAT I MISUNDERSTOOD THE PURPOSE OF DELOREAN BUT I ALSO SAID THAT THE PURPOSE OF PENDULUM IS TO BE A DEATHTIME LIBRARY WELL BEYOND THE SCOPE OF TIMEZONE SWITCHING

BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE TIME TO RESPOND TO SOME POINTS MADE IN THE ARTICLE

IT SEEMS THE AUTHOR THINKS ALL THE OTHER SOLUTIONS ARE BROKEN THAT SEEMS A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED DOESN T IT IS IT LIKELY THAT SO MANY OTHER DEVELOPERS WHO USE OTHER LIBRARIES ARE WRONG AND NOBODY NOTICED

WELL WHEN YOU SEE HOW MANY DEVELOPERS ARE USING ARROW WHICH IS BUGGY IT LEAVES YOU WONDERING SO PENDULUM S GOAL IS TO BE A BETTER VERSION OF WHAT ARROW WANTED TO BE THAT S ALL I STARTED IT WHEN I NOTICED THAT I COULD NO LONGER RELY ON IT

ALWAYS USE UTC WHEN MANIPULATING TIME

I AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT WHAT I MEANT WAS THAT PENDULUM MAKES IT TRANSPARENT FOR THE END USER SO YOU CAN DO DIRECTLY

IMPORT PENDULUM
DT T EUROPE PARIS


DT HOURS


PENDULUM WILL USE UTC INTERNALLY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BUT WHAT THE END USER WANTS IN THE END IS JUST ADD ONE HOUR TO A DEATHTIME IN A SPECIFIC TIMEZONE NOTHING MORE PENDULUM TRIES TO EASE THIS FOR THEM

AS FOR THE BUG IN PENDULUM IT WAS JUST IN THE DST METHOD NOT ANYWHERE ELSE SINCE THE FINAL DEATHTIME WOULD STILL BE CORRECT SO IT WAS PRETTY LIMITED SINCE THE DST IS NOT WIDELY USED WHILE UTCOFFSET IS WHICH WORKED AS EXPECTED
I'LL BE HONEST I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THIS POST IF IT WEREN'T A NARKY REBUTTAL TO A BUNCH OF SOMEONE'S COMMENTS ON REDDIN IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT REPLY ON REDDIN
DELOREAN S EPOCH ASSUMES UTC AND DOESN T SIC

WHY SIC AFTER DOESN'T I ADMIT I'M NOT A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER BUT THAT LOOKS CORRECT TO ME
TIME WASN'T IMPORTANT UNTIL THE EARLY HUM SO WHY THEN DID THE SCILLA NAVAL DISASTER OF LEAD TO THE LONGITUDE ACT AND SO ON TO JOHN HARRISON
IF ANYONE IS GETTING BLOCKED BY CLOUDFLARE PLEASE TRY HERE APOLOGIES
EXCELLENT WORK PASTIL
WHY THE MAJOR VERSION BUMP
I'M IMPRESSED WELL DONE
I THINK YOU SHOULDN'T NEED THE CONTEXT MANAGER WHEN READING THE PROC FILE JUST GET ALL THE INFO THAT IS THERE AND CACHE IT IN THE PROCESS OBJECT
RHINESTONE STATIC THINKCSPY

ALSO LEARNING QUESTIONS ARE BETTER POSTED IN R LEARNPYTHON
ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T GUIDE YOU THROUGH TASKS TRY
AS THERE S A VERY VOCAL MOB IN THE PYTHON COMMUNITY

THERE IS HAVEN'T NOTICED THAT IN THE LAST YEARS OF USING IT
IT IS GOOD TO SEE THE JASON SERIALIZE SUPPORTS DEATHTIME DECIMAL CONVERSION NATIVELY NOW
CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHAT THEIR REASONING WAS FOR SWITCHING TO LOWERCASE SETTING NAMES TO ME UPPERCASE SETTING NAMES TOTALLY MAKES SENSE AND ALSO THEN THE SETTING NAME WILL THE SAME AS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE EQUIVALENT FOR EACH SETTING SWITCHING TO LOWERCASE SETTING NAMES DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME
SOLAR SCHEDULES COOL
TO WHOEVER DESIGNED THAT NEW LOGO YOU ARE A GENIUS
THE AUTORELOAD FEATURE HAS BEEN REMOVED

DAMN IT I USED THAT ALL THE TIME FOR DEVELOPMENT WORK

CELERY RAN ON MY DUAL SERVER IN THE BASEMENT DEVELOPMENT WAS ON MY LAPTOP IN THE LIVING ROOM EVERYTHING WAS ON NFS
LOOK UP DISCOVERY A FEW TOOLS EXIST THEY BASICALLY PROCESS LARGE TRANCHES OF COMMON FILE TYPES LIKE DOC EML ETC AND ALLOW POWERFUL KEYWORD SEARCHES TO TAKE PLACE

IT MAY SOUND LIKE BUT IT'S THE STANDARD APPROACH EVEN WHEN MULTINATIONALS SUE EACH OTHER THEY WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY USE THE SAME SOFTWARE FOR THE TRUMP U CASE
PROBABLY MICROSOFT EXCEL
FORMER USAF NORTH KOREAN CRYPTOLOGIC LINGUIST HERE THEY DIDN'T USE A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY DOESN'T RELY ON PROGRAMMATIC ALGORITHMS TO DETERMINE THE CLASSIFICATION LEVEL OF INFORMATION
QUESTION WHY ON EARTH ARE YOU USING PYTHON
PYTHON HAS BEEN UNSUPPORTED FOR A WHILE YOU SHOULD EXPECT MOST THINGS TO NOT WORK WITH IT

IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE LAST VERSION OF BUMPY THAT SUPPORTS PYTHON IS I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE LEARNING ON OUTDATED PACKAGES IT'S LIKELY YOU'LL LEARN PATTERNS THAT ARE JUST WRONG TODAY
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON I BELIEVE THAT ERROR IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH NEEDING VISUAL STUDIO FOR A COMPILED PIECE I MIGHT SUGGEST USING ANACONDA AND TRYING TO FIND A PRECOMPILED VERSION OF THE LIBRARY YOU NEED
I'VE JUST READ THROUGH SOME MORE OF THE DOCS AND HAVE FOUND OUT THAT I CAN USE THE FOLLOWING ALBEIT CLUNKY WAYS



PYTHON

PYTHON

PIP


PYTHON 2

PY

PY M PIP
EVERYONE I KNOW WHO USES PYTHON ON WINDOWS USE ANACONDA

DOWNLOADS


EITHER ANACONDA OR VIA CYGWIN
NOT SURE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH ENV VARIABLES YET SO IT IS KIND OF HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO START I HAVE PYTHON 2 AND RUNNING ON ALL MY SYSTEMS WITHOUT ANACONDA BUT I DO HEAVILY USE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS

KNOWING ONLY A LITTLE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES I KNOW THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE IN THE PATH MATTERS AS FAR AS WHAT GETS USED IT JUST USES THE FIRST EXECUTABLE IT FINDS

IN MY OPINION I THINK YOU ARE PROBABLY A LITTLE BACKWARDS I WOULD RATHER TYPE PYTHON FOR PYTHON AND LEAVE PYTHON 2 TO BE LAUNCHED WITH PYTHON BECAUSE THIS IS MORE OUT OF THE BOX FUNCTIONALITY

HOWEVER WITH YOUR USE CASE IN MIND I TOOK AN CHANCE AND RENAMED MY AS WHICH MEANS THERE WAS NO LONGER A IN THE PATH WITH THIS PYTHON 2 LAUNCHED MY PYTHON AND PYTHON LAUNCHED MY PYTHON AS I EXPECTED

IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT IS AS FAR AS I WENT IN MY TESTING AND I AM NOT SURE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BROKE DEEPER IN WITH PIP AND SUCH I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE OK BUT I DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY GUARANTEES YOU CAN DO THAT INVESTIGATION

I AGAIN WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT DO THIS KIND OF MONKEYING AROUND AND RELY ON PYTHON TO OPEN PYTHON 2 AND PYTHON TO OPEN PYTHON EVEN BETTER USE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS

I WROTE A VERY SMALL CMD SCRIPT WHICH ALLOWS ME TO SWITCH MY RUNNING PYTHON ENVIRONMENT I WILL SHARE THE CODE WITH YOU WHEN I GET BACK HOME IT REQUIRES THAT THERE IS SOME CONSISTENCY ON WHERE YOU INSTALL PYTHON AND THAT YOU FOLLOW CERTAIN NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR INSTALLS PATHS BUT AFTER IT IS SETUP ALL I NEED TO DO IS

WIMPY SET

THEN PYTHON WILL BE ACTIVE

I STILL USE VIRTUALENV FOR EVERYTHING ELSE
HI THERE FROM THE R PYTHON MODS

WE HAVE REMOVED THIS POST AS IT IS NOT SUITED TO THE R PYTHON SUBREDDIT PROPER HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE VERY APPROPRIATE FOR OUR SISTER SUBREDDIT R LEARNPYTHON WE HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO YOUR POST OVER ON THERE

THE REASON FOR THE REMOVAL IS THAT R PYTHON IS DEDICATED TO DISCUSSION OF PYTHON NEWS PROJECTS USES AND DEBATES IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO ACT AS Q A OR FAQ BOARD THE REGULAR COMMUNITY CAN GET DISENCHANTED WITH SEEING THE SAME REPETITIVE NEWBIE QUESTIONS REPEATED ON THE SUB SO YOU MAY NOT GET THE BEST RESPONSES OVER HERE

HOWEVER ON R LEARNPYTHON THE COMMUNITY IS ACTIVELY EXPECTING QUESTIONS FROM NEW MEMBERS AND ARE LOOKING TO HELP YOU CAN EXPECT FAR MORE UNDERSTANDING ENCOURAGING AND INSIGHTFUL RESPONSES OVER THERE WHATEVER YOUR QUESTION HAPPENS TO BE GETTING HELP WITH PYTHON YOU SHOULD GET GOOD ANSWERS

IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION TO DO WITH HOMEWORK OR AN ASSIGNMENT OF ANY KIND PLEASE MAKE SURE TO READ THEIR SIDEBAR RULES BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR POST IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR DOUBTS FEEL FREE TO REPLY OR SEND A MONOMAIL TO US WITH YOUR CONCERNS

WARM REGARDS AND BEST OF LUCK WITH YOUR PYTHONEERING
USE INSTEAD OF DOING THE SPACE REPLACEMENT IN GETDETAILS CURRENTLY IT LOOKS LIKE IF A SONG NAME HAS AN AMPERSAND IN IT THE SEARCH PARAMETER WILL BE MESSED UP

ADD A TESTING FRAMEWORK TDD IS THE WAY TO GO FOR A MAINTAINABLE PROJECT

READ UP ON PEP SPECIFICALLY THE PORTIONS ON EXCEPTION HANDLING AND FUNCTION NAMES TRY USING PLAINT AND OR PYFLAKES

TRY USING MORE CONSTANTS THAT WAY IT IS EASIER TO MOCK PATCH

I HOPE THAT HELPS A LITTLE GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR PROJECT
IN ADDITION TO WHAT WAS ALREADY REMARKED DON'T PUT CODE IN PY THAT DOESN'T BELONG THERE PY IS NOT A MEANINGFUL NAME FOR A MODULE THAT DOES SOMETHING OTHER THAN ACTUAL MODULE INITIALISATION SOME MORE POINTERS HERE

QUESTIONS

FURTHERMORE KEEP YOUR FUNCTIONS SHORT AND CONCISE AND TRY TO AVOID MANY NESTED TRY EXCEPT CLAUSES ALSO NEVER HAVE EMPTY EXCEPT CLAUSES BUT THAT WAS ALREADY MENTIONED ELSEWHERE IMPLICITLY

ALSO YOU'RE USING THE REQUESTS MODULE BUT ALSO USE URLLIB FURTHER ON I SUGGEST CHOOSING ONE FOR YOUR PARTICULAR USE CASES

WHERE DOES IT GET THE META DATA
I LIKE IT GREAT WORK

ONLY THING I HAVE TO ASK IS WHY NOT USER INPUT OR FOR ASKING THE USER IF THEY WANT TO MANUALLY ADD ANYTHING PROBABLY A BIT FASTER AND LESS OF A HASSLE THEN HOW YOU ARE CURRENTLY DOING IT

ALSO INSTEAD OF PRINTING YOUR ERRORS YOU COULD LOG THEM
VERY NICE TOOL RIGHT HERE

WOULD BE NICE IF THE SCRIPT ADDED ALBUM ART IN SPITE OF THE TRACKS HAVING TAGS ALREADY

WHY ARE YOU USING BOTH URLLIB AND REQUESTS
I WOULD USE LOGGER INSTEAD OF UGLY PRINT

THIS IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL FOR ERRORS SINCE TRACEBACK IS AUTOMATICALLY ADDED TO THE OUTPUT SO NO NEED OF PRINT STR E

EXCEPT
OOPS TIMEOUT ERROR
THIS A GOOD START FOR A SIMPLE PROJECT BUT I THINK A GOOD FRAMEWORK IS REQUIRED TO SIMULATE CONSISTENT BEHAVIOUR WITH A EVER GROWING ECOSYSTEM OF WEB CRAWLERS I RELY ON SCRAPY BUT YOU CAN LOOK INTO REUSING FRAMEWORKS THAT ALREADY EXISTS
EFFICIENT WEB SCRAPING TUTORIAL

USES BLOCKING HETP LIBRARY REQUESTS

ONE OF THE POINTS IS TO INCREASE TIMEOUTS

SERIOUSLY DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT EFFICIENT MEANS
SHOULD THAT BE AN ELSE CLAUSE IN PART ON LINE IF YOUR SCRIPT ERRORS OUT YOU DO NOT WANT TO TRY THE REST A FINALLY CLAUSE WILL HAVE THAT CODE EXECUTED WHETHER THERE IS AN EXCEPTION OR NOT YOU SHOULD USE ELSE SO THAT THE REST OF THE CODE WILL ONLY BE EXECUTED IF THERE ARE NO ERRORS ONE OF YOUR EXAMPLE ERRORS IS NO KEYBOARDINTERRUPT BUT YOU ARE TELLING THE CODE TO CONTINUE REGARDLESS SO ONE OF THOSE OUTCOMES ARE POINTLESS

FOR PART 2 YOU CAN USE A BUILT IN CAPABILITY OF REQUESTS AS YOU DID WITH THE

IF
CONTINUE YOUR SCRIPT


I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE EFFICIENT FILE HANDLING THOUGH I'M NOT TAKING A LOT OF TIME READING THROUGH THAT LONG TRY EXCEPT FINALLY STATEMENT BUT ONE THING YOU MIGHT CONSIDER ADDING IS DOING PROCESSING OF FILES ESPECIALLY FOR VERY LARGE FILES THAT MAY NOT FIT IN A COMPUTER'S MEMORY WITH

AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF HAS A GOOD EXAMPLE ON CHAPTER

TWO QUESTIONS
WHY DO YOU THINK IF DO SOMETHING IS WORSE THAN IF RETURN FALSE

IN THE LAST SECTION HOW ELSE WOULD YOU SAVE THE DATA AND WHERE DID YOUR VARIABLE COME FROM

MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE PIP INSTALLED I CAN'T REMEMBER IF BY INSTALLING PYTHON YOU AUTOMATICAL GET PIP ARE YOU ABLE TO RUN THE PYTHON COMMAND

MAYBE YOU CAN TRY THIS COMMAND PYTHON M PIP INSTALL REQUESTS
ANOTHER THING TO TRY IS PIP INSTEAD OF PIP
FOR THIS TYPE OF QUESTION YOU SHOULD GO TO R LEARNPYTHON

ALSO WHEN YOU FIND THE SOLUTION YOURSELF I ENCOURAGE YOU TO POST IT SO OTHERS CAN BENEFIT FROM IT AS WELL

IF ANYONE IS ALSO LOOKING ABOUT EML STUFF I THINK THE FIRST RECEIVED BY IS THE RECEIVER IP ADDRESS AND THE IS THE ADDRESS FROM THE SENDER IP ADDRESS
THIS ISN'T REALLY A PYTHON QUESTION BUT MORE OF A TELL ME HOW

ARTICLE ON EMAIL HEADER FIELDS IS A PLACE TO START READ THE RELEVANT FCS SUCH AS RFC AND RFC AND RFC FOR WHAT TO EXPECT IN FIELDS

READ INTO EACH FIELD AS YOU COME ACROSS THEM CREATE A FUNCTION FOR PARSING ALL FIELDS AND THEN DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH THE CONTENTS OF EACH

YES I'VE DONE IT
EDIT SPEED AND CLASSIFICATION IS FINE JUST USE BUMPY AND TO SPEED UP SOME OF THE SMALLER THINGS LIKE TRAINING AND WHAT NOT
CHECK OUT FLASK IT'S NOT AS BIG AS DURANGO BUT I'M FAIRLY SURE THAT THEY'RE USING AUTODOC SOMEWHERE ALSO ANYTHING ON

HERE'S A GOOD RESOURCE ON AUTODOC PEOPLE OFTEN USE IT TO GENERATE A FIRST PASS AND THEN EDIT THE RESULTS MANUALLY TO ADD STUFF LIKE TUTORIALS AND EXAMPLES
WHEN YOU INSTALL SPHINX IT ADDS A COMMAND FOR GENERATING THE API DOCS AND OTHER THAN THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO WRITE THE ARST YOURSELF TO CHANGE THE LOOK AND FEEL JUST CHANGE THE HEML THEME
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH AN EXAMPLE BUT MY PET PROJECT SLOTH CI HETP IS ENTIRELY DOCUMENTED WITH SPHINX AND ALL MODULE DOCS ARE GENERATED FROM DOCSTRINGS USING APIDOC AND AUTODOC FEATURES
LOOKS A POWERFUL SET YOU NEED A SECTION ON INSTALLATION WHICH AT LEAST SHOULD GIVE THE PACKAGE NAME ON BYP IF NOT THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

WOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW IF YOUR DECORATORS PRESERVE THINGS LIKE FUNCTION NAME AND SIGNATURE AND OTHER KEY ITEMS SO THAT ANY DEEP CODE INSPECTION TOOLS CONTINUE TO WORK

FINALLY DO YOU HAVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES COMPARE TO ANY EQUIVALENT PYTHON PRIMITIVE FUNCTIONALITY ARE ANY OR ALL OF YOUR METHODS IN C OR PURE PYTHON
THERE ARE DECORATORS WHICH TRY TO PRESERVE THE SIGNATURE AUTOMATED CODE DOCUMENTATION IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND HAVING A DECORATOR ON A PUBLIC FUNCTION WHICH WRECKS THE SIGNATURE WILL DAMAGE THE DOCUMENTATION
YOU SHOULD USE SYSTEMRANDOM OR THE STANDARD RANDOM MODULE IS INSECURE AND NOT SUITABLE FOR ANYTHING RELATED TO CRYPTOGRAPHY
A FEW COMMENTS

WHY ARE YOU USING WORDS TO BUILD THE PASSWORD IF IT IS SO THAT IT CAN BE BETTER REMEMBERED THEN A THE SPECIAL SYMBOLS ARE UNNECESSARY AND B YOU SHOULD USE WORDS THAT ARE VERY DISTINCT EAST G NONE OF THEM HAS THE SAME FIRST THREE LETTERS YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AT THE ELECTRUM WORD LIST WHICH WAS VERY CAREFULLY SELECTED

REGARDING THE STRENGTH OF THE PASSWORD THAT IS JUST A MATTER OF THE NUMBER OF BYTES THAT YOU USE AS SEED RANDOM BYTES BIT ARE CONSIDERED UNBREAKABLE RANDOM BYTES BITS ARE CONSIDERED COLLISION RESISTANT IF THE PASSWORDS MUST BE UNIQUE BREAKABILITY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WAY YOU FORMAT THE PASSWORD AS WORDS CHARACTERS STREAKS OF AND ETC IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF THE SIZE OF THE SEED

THE WAY YOU TEST THE TIMING IS SKEWED YOU'LL GET INCORRECT RESULTS THE PROPER WAY TO TIME PYTHON CODE IS USING THE TIMET MODULE

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PASSWORD GENERATION YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT A STATELESS PASSWORD MANAGER THAT I WROTE ALSO A BRAIN WALLET CALLED NO-FAULT IT MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME MORE IDEAS
WOW THAT'S AN AWESOME AND INSIGHTFUL WRITE-UP

I HAVE ONE QUESTION THOUGH IF WE GET BACKPRESSURE AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH UNBUFFERED FOR THE CURRENT LOGICAL THREAD WRITES DON'T WE OPEN OURSELVES TO ACTUAL DEADLOCKS LIKE A CLIENT ISN'T READING UNTIL ITS WRITE COMPLETELY COMPLETES AND THE SERVER ISN'T READING ANY MORE DATA UNTIL IT FULLY WRITES ITS CURRENT RESPONSE
DO I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT WHAT CURIO DOES TO CONTROL FLOW IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO EVENT WITH LESS HACKY HELL AND MONKEYS AND IN TURN SIMILAR TO THREADS WITH LESS OVERHEAD AND SYNC CONCERNS OF COURSE

AND WHAT ASYNCIO DOES IS INDEED AN ADDITION ON TOP OF THE EVENTLOOP SIMILAR TO TWISTED AND TORNADO

THIS TOGETHER WITH UNYIELDING HAVE DONE WHAT I HAVE WANTED FOR A LONG TIME THEY'VE FINALLY CONVINCED ME THAT ASYNC AWAIT ISN'T JUST WORTH THE COLOURING THE COLOURING IS A GOOD THING

THANKS
USING A POSIX SOCKETS INSPIRED API IN ASYNCIO WAS DISCUSSED AT THE TIME IN THE END WE WERE PERSUADED BY TWISTED DEVELOPERS THAT THE SOCKETS API IS TOO LOW LEVEL AND ERROR PRONE

APPARENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTLESS BUGS IN TWISTED APPS MODULES DUE TO THE FACT THAT PROGRAMMERS ARE TOO LAZY TO CHECK THAT THE SOCKET ECV CALL ACTUALLY RETURNS THE NUMBER OF BYTES REQUESTED THE PROGRAM SHOULD HAVE A LOOP TO KEEP READING INTO A BUFFER UNTIL ALL THE NEEDED BYTES WERE AVAILABLE BUT DEVELOPERS OFTEN FORGET THAT LIKEWISE FOR SENDING YOU ASK A SOCKET TO SEND A BUNCH OF BYTES BUT THE SOCKET MIGHT ACCEPT FEWER BYTES DUE TO THE BUFFER BEING FULL

THIS LEADS TO BUGS THAT ARE HARD TO TRACK DOWN BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE COMPUTER SPEED NETWORK CONDITIONS THE PHASE OF THE MOON ETC YOUR PROGRAM MAY WORK CORRECTLY USUALLY WHEN IT ASKS FOR BYTES AND GETS BYTES IN A SINGLE CALL BUT WHEN YOU PUT IT INTO PRODUCTION THE SOCKET MAY RETURN BYTES IN THE FIRST CALL AND WOULD RETURN MORE BYTES IN ANOTHER CALL THESE ARE THE WORST TYPE OF BUGS THEY DON'T MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN DEV TESTING BUT APPEAR IN PRODUCTION SOUND FAMILIAR

TO AVOID THIS ASYNCIO STREAMS OFFER A HIGHER LEVEL APPROACH AND AUTOMATICALLY SORT OUT THESE DETAILS FOR YOU
YOU CAN ASK TO RECEIVE N BYTES EXACTLY AND ASYNCIO WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR YOU
2 EVEN IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO READ NOW FROM THE STREAM FOR A WHILE ASYNCIO WILL READ IN THE BACKGROUND AND BUFFER THE DATA FOR YOU
FOR SENDING YOU JUST WRITE SOME BYTES AND ASYNCIO WILL TAKE CARE OF THE DETAILS

YES YOU HAVE A POINT ABOUT BUFFER BLOAT BUT THERE IS AN API IN ASYNCIO TO CONFIGURE THE AMOUNT BUFFERING ASYNCIO DOES FOR YOU THE DEFAULTS ARE USUALLY GOOD ENOUGH BUT OF COURSE APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE LOW LATENCY CAN TWEAK THE BUFFERING THRESHOLDS
THERE ARE A SHITSTORM OF LIBRARIES AVAILABLE FOR FRONTED SUCH AS REACT AND ANGULAR BUT IN MY OPINION ESPECIALLY IN SMALLER PROJECTS KEEP IT SIMPLE

TAKE SOMETHING AS MATERIALIZE CSS OR EVEN BOOTSTRAP AND MAKE USE OF TEMPLATING ENGINE
HI I USE ANGULAR WITH DURANGO DOESN'T COME WITHOUT PITFALLS I WRITE JS IN A MORE PYTHONIC WAY WITH THE FANTASTIC LIVESCRIPT AND PRELUDE

I USE THOSE FOR A WEBAPP FOR BOOKSHOPS WHERE WE CAN SEARCH BOOKS BY ISBN DO INVENTORIES SELL THEM SEE STATS ETC COME HAVE A LOOK

GITHUB MIRROR
THE ISBN SCRAPING LIB HOW TO YOU GET ISBN PYISBN IS PRETTY LIMITED
RELATED
I QUITE LIKE DECOUPLING MY BACKEND AND FRONT END FROM EACH OTHER

FOR FRONTED TAKE A LOOK AT



INTRO TO IT

YOU WILL LOVE IT

FOR BACKEND I TEND TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FLASK OR DURANGO DEPENDING ON THE USE CASE


CHECK OUT WETBACK OR NICOLI DON'T USE DURANGO STATIC FILES LET YOUR BUILD PROCESS MANAGE THEM
TRY R LEARNPYTHON ALSO TO FORMAT YOUR CODE AS CODE ON REDDIN INDENT IT WITH FOUR SPACES ALSO YOU'RE MISSING A CLOSING PARENTHESIS ON THE PREVIOUS LINE

FROM THE LOOKS OF IT YOU NEVER CLOSE A COUPLE OF YOUR PRINTS YOU CAN ALSO JUST N N IN YOUR LAST PRINT TO ADD TWO NEWLINES RATHER THAN USING EMPTY PRINTS

ALSO FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY PEP MY FRIEND USING SOMETHING LIKE PYCHARM HELPS YOU GET INTO GOOD HABITS IN THAT RESPECT

VARIABLES AREN'T DECLARED WITH A TYPE BUT I FIND MYSELF DOING MORE TYPE-CASTING THAN I WOULD IN C OR JAVA SO IF I DON'T GET ANY FEATURES LIKE I WOULD IN ES WHY ARE THERE NOT VARIABLES TYPES TO BEGIN WITH

YOU'RE NOT CASTING YOU'RE CREATING NEW OBJECTS USING THE OLD OBJECT AS AN ARGUMENT EXPLICIT IS BETTER THAN IMPLICIT

I HATE THE FACT THAT THERE ISN'T A COMMON ITERATION INTERFACE FOR THE TWO CONTAINERS LISTED ABOVE EAST G FOR VAR VAR 2 IN CONTAINERS WHICH RETURNS INDEX VALUE FOR LIST KEY VALUE FOR MAP SIMILAR TO WHAT GO I MEAN C MANAGED TO IMPLEMENTED A ITERATION INTERFACE FOR OVER A DOZEN CONTAINERS PYTHON ONLY HAS TWO CONTAINERS WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE WAYS TO ITERATE A LIST AND DIFFERENT WAYS TO ITERATE A MAP

BECAUSE LISTS AND DCTS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT DATA STRUCTURES WITH FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT SEMANTICS YOU NEED TO BE EXPLICIT IN HOW YOU ITERATE OVER THESE THINGS

I HATE THE FACT THAT MANY COMMON OPERATOR I'M USED WITH ARE NO IN THE LANGUAGE EAST G

I MEAN THAT SOUNDS LIKE A NITPICK I THINK AND READS A LOT CLEANER THAN PERSONALLY

I HATE THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE BUILT IN FUNCTIONS DON'T REALLY SHARE AND SIMILARITIES IN THE WAY ONE HAS TO THINK ABOUT THEM EAST G THERE ARE SOME FUNCTIONS THAT ARE CALLED WITH CONTAINERS AS ARGUMENTS WHICH GIVE BASIC CONTAINER PROPERTIES EAST G LEN STR GIVES YOU LENGTH OF STR SPLITS STR ASSUMING STR IS A STRING THERE SEEMS TO BE NO CONSENSUS EVEN AMONG BUILT IN FEATURE DESIGNERS IF THE LANGUAGE OR EVEN ITS CONTAINERS SHOULD BE OO OR NOT I MEAN IN JAVA I KNOW THAT IF I WANT TO OPERATE UPON THE MEMBERS OF A CLASS THAT'S BUILT IN THE LANGUAGE I WILL DO SO WITH METHODS IN GO I KNOW THAT IF I WANT TO OPERATE UPON A STRUCTURE OR ENTITY THAT'S BUILT IN THE LANGUAGE I WILL CALL A FUNCTION EXTERNAL TO IT EVEN C MANAGES TO KEEP CONSISTENCY AMONG VARIOUS STD MODULES

IN JAVA YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE IT'S EITHER AN INSTANCE METHOD OR AN AWKWARD STATIC METHOD

YOU SEEM TO BE CONFUSING BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS TOO IS AN INSTANCE METHOD OF STRONG LEN IS A BUILT-IN FUNCTION THAT WORKS ON ALL OBJECTS THAT IMPLEMENT

I HATE THE FACT THAT THE VARIOUS INTERPRETERS COMPILERS SEEM TO DIVERGE ON ARBITRARY FEATURES THAT DON'T ACUTELY SEEM TO MATTER THAT MUCH AND MAKE CODE HARD TO PORT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER

ALL LANGUAGES WITH MULTIPLE IMPLEMENTATIONS HAVE THIS PROBLEM HAVE YOU EVER TRIED USING ML

I HATE THE FACT THAT SOME MANY FEATURES CHANGED BETWEEN VERSIONS OBVIOUSLY SOME WERE DUE FOR A CHANGE BUT OTHER EAST G CHANGES FOR THE IMPORT SYSTEM JUST FEEL LIKE A SYNTACTIC CHANGE THAT ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING BUT TO ADD CONFUSION TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE INS AND OUTS OF BOTH LANGUAGES

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU THERE THE LANGUAGE IS EVOLVING NOBODY IS FORCING YOU TO USE THE LATEST VERSION TALK TO A PERL DEVELOPER ABOUT BREAKING CHANGES

FINALLY I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE FACT THAT BOTH AND X ARE STILL WIDELY IN USE AND I THUS GOOGLING FOR ANYTHING RELATED TO PYTHON BECOMES ABOUT TWICE AS TEDIOUS SINCE I HAVE TO REALIZE THE PERSON IS TALKING ABOUT 2 OR OR IF THE FEATURE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IS VERSION NEUTRAL

IS IT REALLY THAT HARD TO TYPE PYTHON INSTEAD OF PYTHON

OH I ALSO HATE THE FACT THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE VARIOUS GUIDES SO POSTS LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORKS WHICH HAVEN'T BEEN BURNT TO THE GROUND BY THE COMMUNITY DESPITE BEING WRITTEN IN AN OBVIOUSLY FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM WRONG FASHION BY WHICH I MEAN HIGHLY INEFFICIENT DUE TO EASY TO CORRECT MISTAKES THOUGHT I GUESS THAT IN A DAY AND AGE WHERE HALF THE LIBRARIES OF ANOTHER LANGUAGE WHICH I WON'T NAME FAILED THEIR BUILD BECAUSE SOMEONE REMOVED A WHITESPACE PADDING MODULE ITS NOT SO MUCH AN ISSUE AS ANOTHER THING THAT MAKES ME SAD

THIS IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE COMMUNITY NOT A DEMOCRACY IF SOMEONE MAKES A LIBRARY THAT DOES THINGS WRONG AND LOTS OF PEOPLE USE IT WAS IT REALLY WRONG MAKE YOUR OWN AND GET EVERYONE TO SWITCH

IT SEEMS THAT YOUR ISSUES AREN'T WITH PYTHON BUT RATHER WITH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL ALL MATURE LANGUAGES HAVE THESE ISSUES IF YOU WANT PERFECTION THEN MAKE YOUR OWN

I'LL WAIT

THERE ARE THREE BASIC DATA STRUCTURES LIST DICT AND SET
YOUR CONCERNS ARE LEGITIMATE BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO REALIZE THAT NO LANGUAGE IS PERFECT I USE PYTHON BECAUSE THERE I S NOTHING BETTER AS FAR AS INTERPRETED LANGUAGES GO EVEN IF I FIND SOME ASPECTS OF PYTHON FRUSTRATING

IN ANY EVENT YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT SWIFT WHICH SEEMS TO BORROW MUCH FROM PYTHON BUT LEAVES BEHIND THE TROUBLESOME ASPECTS

OH AND ABOUT VARIABLE DECLARATIONS I TO FIND PYTHON FRUSTRATING I'M OF THE SCHOOL THAT YOU DEFINE WHAT YOU WANT AS A PROGRAMMER AND RELY UPON THE COMPILER TO FLAG ANY IMPROPER USES OF COURSE THIS IS PARTIALLY ABOUT CHOOSING THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR THE TASK AT HAND
PYTHON CAN BE A PAIN ON WINDOWS BUT ANACONDA SHOULD FIX OF YOUR STUDENT'S ISSUES WITHOUT ANY CONFIGURATION
THERE REALLY IS NO POINT IN THAT PYTHON WORKS JUST FINE ON WINDOWS NATIVELY ZERO HASSLE I'VE GOT A MATCHBOOK PRO AND A SURFACE PRO 2 WITH WINDOWS AND I PREFER DOING PYTHON PROGRAMMING AND ANY PROGRAMMING ON THE BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH EASIER IT IS

I KNOW MY VIEWS AREN'T POPULAR BUT TWO SECRETS TO CREATING A PRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ON WINDOWS USE POWERSHELL 2 USE SCOOP HETP TO INSTALL PYTHON PSHAZZ AND OTHER DEVELOPER SOFTWARE MAYBE IS USE MISCODE WITH PYTHON EXTENSION WHICH IS PURELY AMAZING

POWERSHELL IS A GREAT SHELL WITH FAMILIAR BASH ALIASES BUT A LOT MORE CONCISE SYNTAX WITH PSHAZZ YOU CAN EASILY MAKE IT A BEAUME WITH GIT AUTOCOMPLETIONS AND STUFF

SCOOP IS A PACKAGE MANAGER THAT REALLY FIXES THE WHOLE INSTALLING PYTHON ON WINDOWS IS PAIN THING IT INSTALLS ALL YOUR PACKAGES INTO ONE LOCATION IN YOUR HOMELIER SO YOU WON'T NEED TO PROVIDE ADMIN PRIVILEGES TO INSTALL STUFF AND YOU'LL ALWAYS KNOW WHERE YOUR PACKAGES ARE UNLIKE WITH BREW ON MACBS WHERE THERE ARE THREE PYTHONS IN THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS

SERIOUSLY WINDOWS IS A GREAT OS FOR DEVELOPERS IT'S NO LONGER XP DAYS AND THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY SHOULD EMBRACE THE FACT
YOU SHOULD USE PYTHON NATIVELY IN WINDOWS ANECDOTE I HAVE TWO COMPUTERS ONE WITH WIN THE OTHER UBUNTU I RUN ANACONDA PYCHARM ATOM ON BOTH AND THE TRANSITIONS ARE SEAMLESS THE ONLY PROBLEM ON WINDOWS I'VE NOTICED IS THAT TENSORFLOW DOESN'T WORK

BASH PYTHON ON WINDOWS DOESN'T WORK WITH GUI THINGS LIKE PLOTTING AND RUNS INTO MEMORY PROBLEMS
IF YOUR MAIN USE CASE IS NOTEBOOKS THEN HAVE YOU TRIED ANACONDA
I'VE BEEN TEACHING PROGRAMMING AT UNIVERSITY AND ANACONDA WORKS GREAT EVEN AS STUDENTS COME IN WITH WINDOWS OR DSX AS OLD AS
I TRIED OUR ENTIRE LINUX DSX BASED STACK ON BASH ON WINDOWS BY DOWNLOADING THE LINUX BIT ANACONDA INSTALLER AND JUST USING THAT WORKED FLAWLESSLY THIS IS A MODERN PYTHON DATA SCIENCE STACK BUMPY SNIPY PANDAS ETC

ALTHOUGH I PREFER WORKING ON THE WINDOWS ANACONDA INSTALLATION
I DO A TON OF DATA MINING I LIVE ON WIN POWERSHELL COMMAND LINE PYTHON JUPITER AND NOTEBOOKS

USE ANACONDA DISTRIBUTION OF PYTHON WITH A SLIGHT HICCUP OF HAVING TO DOWNLOAD TWO AND INSTALL TWO POWERSHELL SCRIPTS TO GET ACTIVATE ENV TO HAVE VIRTUALENV WORK PROPERLY

SWITCH DON'T LOOK BACK


FIRST OFF IF YOU'RE REALLY THAT UNHELPFUL TO STUDENTS WITH WINDOWS MACHINES THAT'S INCREDIBLY DEPRESSING SECONDLY IF YOU'RE MAINLY DOING DATA ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON WINDOWS IS EXTREMELY EASY TO USE I CAN PROBABLY SPIN UP ANACONDA WITH JUPITER RUNNING VERY SMOOTHLY IN ABOUT MINUTES ON WINDOWS FINALLY YOU CAN DEFINITELY USE JUPITER ON BASH ON UBUNTU ON WINDOWS THE ANNIVERSARY UPDATE IF THAT'S CONFUSING JUST INSTALL ANACONDA OR PIP INSTALL ALL THE DEPENDENCIES YOU WANT LAUNCH WITH JUPITER NOTEBOOK THEN POINT YOUR BROWSER ON WINDOWS TO LOCAL HOST WHEREVER THE OUTPUT TELLS YOU IT'S HOSTED DO NOT TRY TO ROLL WITH SERVER OR WHATEVER PERSONALLY I THINK WINDOWS WITH UBUNTU IS THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS FOR DATA ANALYSIS
I'VE RAN JUPITER ON ALWISE AND IT WORKED HAVEN'T USED IT MUCH BUT IT DID WORK
I'M USING IT RIGHT NOW INSTALLED ALL MY USUAL STACK VIM AND ANACONDA AND HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE BUG SO FAR YOU CAN EVEN RUN JUPITER NOTEBOOKS FROM BASH AND OPEN IT FROM A BROWSER ON WINDOWS YOU CAN USE GIT ON FOLDER THAT ARE ON YOUR WINDOWS SUBDIRECTORIES SO FAR EVERYTHING JUST WORKED
SLIGHTLY OFFTOPIC A REDDITION WHO DID SOME HEAVY NUMBER CRUNCHING ONCE POINTED OUT THAT HIS PYTHON IN WINDOWS LINUX SUBSYSTEM ACTUALLY RUNS FASTER THAN THE NATIVE ONE WHICH I THINK HAS TO DO WITH A DIFFERENT DISPATCH MECHANISM BUT I DON'T KNOW YET
LINES LONGER THAN CHARACTERS ARE BAD WHEN I'M PROGRAMMING ON MY WRISTWATCH IT CAN ONLY BARELY FIT THAT
PLEASE PEOPLE DON'T LET THIS THREAD BE ABOUT POLITICS
IS THERE A CERTAIN WAY TO TYPE SPACES OR IS IT NOT INCLUDED YET
I CAN'T DO IMPORT THIS THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS NICE WORK BTW
WELL DONE DO YOU THINK THAT COULD BE USED AS A REPLACEMENT FOR CIVY LAUNCHER
HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO PYTHON
I GREW TIRED OF WRESTLING URLLIB AND URLPARSE TO MANIPULATE BURLS SO I BUILT FURL

IF YOU WORK WITH BURLS TRY FURL FURL MAKES IT EASY TO CREATE AND MANIPULATE BURLS EVEN COMPLEX ONES

I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
INSTANT STAR SO I CAN USE IT LATER I'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH NRL MANIPULATION IN THE PAST BECAUSE THE NRL ITSELF HAD BRACKETS AND THAT CAUSED PROBLEMS WITH FORMAT I ENDED UP USING SOME CHAINED REPLACES NOT PROUD OF THAT AT ALL
PREGAME GETS A BAD RAP HERE SOMETIMES BUT THERE'S BEEN SOME COOL PROJECTS MADE WITH IT AND GREAT RESOURCES TO LEARN FROM EVEN THE PREGAME DOCUMENTATION IS PRETTY AWESOME IN MY OPINION

AL SWEIGART HAS A COUPLE OF GREAT ONLINE BOOKS THAT ARE COMPLETELY FREE THAT USE PREGAME THE FIRST ONE HAS A COUPLE GREAT PROJECTS AT THE END FOR PREGAME THOUGH THE WHOLE BOOK IS FULL OF GAMES THAT TEACH MANY LOGICAL PRINCIPLES IN GENERAL AND THE SECOND ONE HTTPS IS PURELY PREGAME FOCUSED WITH VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT GAMES

ALSO HERE'S AN EXCELLENT YOUTUBE SERIES FOR PREGAME AS WELL

THE PREGAME SITE HAS MANY COOL GAMES MOST BEING OPEN SOURCE BUT FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING WITH A MORE PROFESSIONAL POLISH THERE'S ALSO A FEW GREAT EXAMPLES OUT THERE

TUXEMON DOESN'T GET NEARLY ENOUGH ATTENTION BUT IT'S A VERY AMBITIOUS FLESHED OUT OPEN SOURCE POKEMON CLONE BUILT WITH PREGAME AS A DEPENDENCY

THERE'S ALSO A VERY SUCCESSFUL TITLE BY THE NAME OF SWITCHCARS ON THE STEAM STORE MADE IN PREGAME THE CREATOR EVEN POSTED IN THE PREGAME SUBREDDIT HE SAYS THAT AFTER COMPLETING THE ENTIRE GAME BY TRANSITIONING IT TO 2 WITH LITTLE MODIFICATIONS IT'S PERFORMANCE WAS FANTASTIC

PREGAME IS STILL BEING UPDATED SLOWLY AND AVAILABLE IN BIT OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN SITE THANKS TO THE OPENSOURCE COMMUNITY

THERE'S LOTS OF GREAT RESOURCES AND EXAMPLES OUTSIDE OF THESE I WOULD SAY THAT PREGAME IS MUCH BETTER FOR 2D GAMES THEN 3D THOUGH AND I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE OTHER PYTHON GAME MODULES OUT THERE THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST AS GOOD OR EVEN BETTER

I THINK THAT IT'S EXCITING TO DEVELOP WITH TOOLS THAT AREN'T THE MOST WELL KNOWN BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU CAN BE THE ONE WHO GIVES IT A NAME AND ATTRACT MORE CREATIVE TALENT TO IT'S COMMUNITY PREGAME IS POWERFUL AND HAS THE TOOLS THOUGH FOR GREAT POTENTIAL

DESPITE HOW MUCH I DEFEND IT AM I ADVOCATING ANYONE USE PREGAME IN PARTICULAR NO I'M JUST MAKING A POINT IT'S NOT TO BE UNDERRATED THE ONLY THING I ADVOCATE IS GET A VISION THEN PICK AN ENGINE OR FRAMEWORK OR WHATEVER AND STICK WITH IT AND LEARN IT INSIDE OUT AS LONG AS THE TOOL YOU CHOOSE HAS HAVE SOME BUILDING BLOCKS TO WORK WITH THE REST COMES DOWN TO HARDWORK AND PERSISTENCE

I UNDERSTAND THAT ASPIRING INDIE DEVELOPERS DESIRE FINDING AN OPTIMAL TOOLSHED BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HEAVILY INVEST INTO SOMETHING AND YOU DON'T WANT TO REGRET YOUR CHOICE IF SOMETHING ELSE HAS OR WILL HAVE A SHINY THING IT'S A NATURAL DILEMI MANY SMART PEOPLE HAVE BUT HERE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL EVER HEAR WHEN YOU HESITATE YOU ARE PRACTICING HESITATION HESITATION BECOMES A HABIT AND IN TRAINING IN HESITATION HESITATION WILL BECOME YOUR SKILL

IT DOESN'T HURT TO JUST JUMP INTO SOMETHING BUT I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS MERIT IN DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH HERE AND THERE JUST BE SURE TO MAKE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A LITTLE SEARCHING AND JUST PROCRASTINATING IT MAY SEEM PRODUCTIVE TO HOP AROUND AS YOU FIND A SHINIER OR BETTER OR MORE POWERFUL OR EASIER TOY BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A SLOW POISON BECAUSE THIS IS A RED FLAG THAT WILL USUALLY LEAD TO BURN OUT FOR MOST PEOPLE IT JUST HAPPENS SO SLOW PEOPLE DON'T NOTICE IT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE

THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD OPINIONS HERE BUT AN EXCELLENT SWORDSMAN WITH A WOODEN BLADE CAN OVERCOME A BAD SWORDSMAN WITH A STEEL MASTERPIECE SHARPENED TO PRECISION THIS ANALOGY DOESN'T MEAN TO START WITH A WOODEN BLADE THOUGH THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH DOING SO BUT RATHER THAT WHEN A BAD SWORDSMAN FOCUSES SO MUCH ON FINDING THE PERFECT BLADE THIS VANITY BECOMES A HANDICAP BECAUSE IT DISTRACTS THEM AWAY FROM BECOMING THE BEST SWORDSMAN THEY CAN BE PICK UP ANY BLADE AND FOCUS ON TECHNIQUE FIND OUT WHAT THE LIMITS ARE OF THAT BLADE AND GET TO KNOW IT PERSONALLY AND MEANINGFULLY OTHER PEOPLE WILL HAVE STRONGER OR LONGER BLADES BUT MOST WILL BE DISTRACTED WITH HOW SHINY AND POWERFUL THEIR BLADE IS AND MISS OUT ON CRUCIAL FUNDAMENTALS AND SHAMEFULLY QUIT BELIEVING THEY AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH OR DON'T HAVE THE DEDICATION THIS IS BECAUSE THEY CAME IN FROM THE WRONG ANGLE TO BEGIN WITH THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO LEARN THE SPIRIT OF THE THING ITSELF THE ARCFORM SOME MAY ARGUE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MUSCLE MEMORY AND COGNITIVE THINKING SINCE I'M COMPARING SOMETHING LIKE SWORDSMANSHIP TO PROGRAMMING BUT COGNITIVE THINKING IS APPLICABLE ANYWHERE AND COMPLACENCY AS A PROGRAMMER ISN'T MUCH DIFFERENT THEN MUSCLE MEMORY

JUST PUSH YOURSELF I DON'T CARE IF YOUR IDEA OF PROGRAMMING IS PLAYING WITH REDSTONE IN MINECRAFT I DON'T CARE IF YOUR IDEA OF PROBLEM SOLVING IS SODOKU PUZZLES I DON'T CARE IF YOU WANT TO START IN ASSEMBLY OR SCRATCH THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS PICKING ONE THING AND NOT GIVING UP UNTIL YOU ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING YOU CAN BE PROUD OF AND IT'S AT THAT MOMENT YOU WILL REALIZE HOW IRREVERENT AND DETRIMENTAL IT IS TO BE TOO PICKY

I DO FEEL THAT DYNAMIC HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES ARE A GREAT SWEETSPOT THOUGH REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR GRAPHIC MODULES LOOK LIKE I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE PYTHONIC PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE IT STREAMLINES THE CONCEPTUAL TEACHING AND ABSTRACT THINKING PROCESS AND THERE'S A GREAT BALANCE BETWEEN HAVING A FAST WORKFLOW AND AT THE SAME TIME ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE ANY KIND OF GAME

ONCE YOU CAN CREATE TEXT GAMES WITH ANY DEGREE OF COMPLEXITY THAT'S MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAT LOGIC IS THE HEART OF THE GAME IT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN AND ADDING GRAPHICS ON TOP OF IT IS ONLY AN EMBELLISHMENT THAT ANY OF THE MODULES COULD DO LOGIC IS THE KEY COMPONENT AND YOUR SECRET SAUCE THINGS THAT CAN HELP THIS ENDEAVOR IS TO HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF COORDINATE SYSTEMS AND HOW TO MANIPULATE THEM WITH FOR LOOPS DCTS AND LISTS UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT OBJECTS OPERATE IN TERMS OF SCOPE AND HOW TO LOGICALLY ARRANGE THE CODE BEING ABLE TO DECONSTRUCT THE LOGIC NEEDED TO PRODUCE A GAME AND RECONSTRUCT IT IN A WAY A COMPUTER CAN UNDERSTAND IS ALL MODULE AND EVEN LANGUAGE AGNOSTIC

STUDY NEW MATH OR OTHER PEOPLES CODE USE YOUR DEFAULT PAINT PROGRAM OR PHOTOSHOP OR GET ANY OF THE MANY GREAT FREEWARE DESIGNED FOR SPIRITING IF YOU'RE CREATING ASSETS THEN YOU'LL FEEL MORE PERSONALLY INVESTED AND THIS IS ALSO MODULE AND LANGUAGE AGNOSTIC THERE'S LOTS OF GREAT FREE MUSIC OUT THERE BUT ALSO SO MANY FREE PROGRAMS FOR MAKING YOUR OWN MUSIC MAYBE DRAW OUT ON PAPER HOW THINGS SHOULD LOOK IN YOUR GAME LEARN FLOWCHART ETIQUETTE AND CHART OUT YOUR GAME OR PROBLEM FOR CLARITY YED IS EXCELLENT GRAPHING FREEWARE IF ADDING FLOWCHARTS TO YOUR TOOLBOX IS APPEALING TO YOU OR CURIOUS JUST DO SOMETHING

HAVE FUN BECAUSE IT'S A LONG ROAD AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE JOURNEY WHAT SETS THOSE WHO SUCCEED APART FROM THOSE WHO DON'T IS THEY WORKED HARD AND DIDN'T GIVE UP THAT MAY SOUND CLICHE BUT DISCIPLINE DOESN'T COME EASY WHAT SETS THE BEST GAME DEVELOPERS APART ESPECIALLY IN THE AND IS HOW MUCH THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH SO LITTLE AND EVEN WITH TOOLS WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO REPLICATE WE'RE SO SPOILED IN COMPARISON WITH ALL THE POWERFUL FREE TOOLS AVAILABLE TODAY

YOU SUCK AT ART THE FIRST STEP TO GETTING BETTER IS FAILING ARE YOU TOO STUPID TOO PROGRAM THE FIRST STEP TO GETTING BETTER IS STILL FAILING IS YOUR WORK ETHIC TERRIBLE THEN FIND OUT WHAT YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT IN LIFE AND DO THAT INSTEAD IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS THEN I MUST BE A MAGICIAN BECAUSE IF YOU JUST HAD THAT REALIZATION OR EVEN BRAVE ENOUGH TO DARE TO THINK THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THEN YOUR WORK ETHIC WILL FROM THIS POINT BE MUCH BETTER YOU OBVIOUSLY CARE IF YOU'VE READ THIS FAR DO YOU HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING UP IN THE MORNING WELL THE SWEET NOTHINGS YOUR SEDUCTRESS OF A PILLOW WHISPERS LIKE BINDING INCANTATIONS TO A SEALING RITUAL IS ACTUALLY JUST A LOW LEVEL ILLUSION HEX IT'S EASY TO BREAK IT WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD JUST DON'T GO HAVING AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS NOW

NO MATTER WHAT YOUR SCHEDULE LOOKS LIKE OR HOW MUCH YOU HAVE ON YOUR SHOULDERS OR EVEN HOW MUCH YOU'VE LOST IF YOU THINK CHILLING OR CHASING BOOTY OR BEING LED BY THE NECK BY SOCIETY IS ENOUGH TO STOP YOU IF YOU EVEN CONSIDER THIS ISN'T FOR YOU AND DOUBT YOUR OWN LIMITS THEN YOU CLOSED THE DOOR WHAT YOU COULD BE BECOMES A WHAT IF AND YEARS DOWN THE LINE YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK IT UP AGAIN AND NOW IS YOUR CHANCE TO GET A YEAR HEADSTART ON THAT PERSON WHO GAVE UP YOUR CHANCE TO REWRITE THE PATH YOUR FUTURE IS HEADED THE WRITER OF HARRY POTTER J KING BOWLING HAD HER MOTHER DIE A CHILD A DIVORCE AND LIFE OF RELATIVE POVERTY BEFORE HER FIRST NOVEL EVEN GOT RELEASED AN IPHONE DEVELOPER ON REDDIN KNOWN AS WHITAKERBLACKALL CAME A LONG WAY IN A YEAR AND HIS BEST ADVICE WAS JUST KEEP CODING

I'VE ESSENTIALLY SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT TIMES BY THIS POINT BUT I'M GOING TO REITERATE IT ONE MORE TIME TO CLARIFY MY POINT DON'T BE LAZY JUST GOD DAMN FUCKING DO IT

HAVE A LOT OF FAILURES THE KEY IS TO FAIL QUICKLY NOT TO AVOID FAILING YOU NEED NOT TO GET DISCOURAGED THIS IS THE KEY INSIGHT TO SUCCESS IN ANY CREATIVE ENDEAVOR CREATORS LEARN IT EARLY OR ARE NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN

I SAY ALL THIS BECAUSE WHAT HOLDS MOST PEOPLE BACK IS THEMSELVES
PASSION IS ALSO LANGUAGE ENGINE FRAMEWORK AND MODULE AGNOSTIC

DEEP DOWN EVERYONE KNOWS ALL THIS THOUGH IT JUST HELPS TO HEAR IT FROM SOMEONE OTHER THEN OURSELVES

PLEASE

NO MATTER IF YOU WISH TO HAVE A DEGREE OR NOT FILL UP YOUR GITHUB WITH GOOD PROJECTS

ONE WAY TO GET A DEV JOB WITHOUT A DEGREE IS TO GET A JOB AS A TECHNICIAN AND CONTINUOUSLY CREATE HANDY TOOLS THAT SOLVES OR AUTOMATES PROBLEMS AT YOUR POSITION THEN SLOWLY CLIMB YOUR RANKS

I DONT KNOW HOW IT IS IN YOUR COUNTRY BUT IN NORWAY I THINK EXPERIENCE ENTHUSIASM AND I NETWORK WITH GOOD REFERENCES IS BORH MORE
FRIEND WAS IN THIS BOAT TRY GENERAL ASSEMBLY IF YOU CAN SPEND IT'S CHEAPER THAN COLLEGE OR ANOTHER COURSE SET LIKE THEIRS THAT FOCUSES ON JOB PLACEMENT AS A SELLING POINT AND IF NOT GITHUBING IT UP LIKE EVERYONE SAYING SHOULD DO IT ON TOP OF A COURSE AS MY PAL DID AND IF ANY SPECIFIC COMPANIES IN MIND IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO START WORK ON PROJECTS INVOLVING RELATED SKILLS
MAKE SURE YOUR GITHUB HAS QUALITY REPOSITORIES OR YOU CONTRIBUTE TO A QUALITY PROJECT HOWEVER DON'T STRESS YOURSELF ABOUT FINDING A PROJECT TO CONTRIBUTE TO LET IT COME TO YOU NATURALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT YOU'RE JUST STARTING OUT I'D RECOMMEND YOU MAKE A SEPARATE ACCOUNT WHICH WILL HOUSE YOUR BEGINNER PROJECTS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS CONDUCTED MANY INTERVIEWS WHEN I SEE A GITHUB WITH VERY LITTLE OR BEGINNER TUTORIALS IT'S USUALLY A RED FLAG
VERB PAGE OF ENGINEERING HERE

I DON'T USUALLY LOOK FOR A DEGREE WHEN I'M HIRING I WORK FOR A SMALL ENOUGH FIRM THAT I SCREEN MY OWN CANDIDATES I LOOK FOR APPLICANTS WHO HAVE GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF BEST PRACTICES AND DESIGN PATTERNS I ALSO LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO PROGRAM ON THEIR OWN AND NOT JUST FOR THEIR JOB BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT PROGRAMMING ARE THE ONES WHO'LL LIKELY BRING NEW TECH AND IDEAS INTO YOUR COMPANY

IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DEGREE YOU COULD LOOK FOR WEEK PROGRAMS LIKE CODECREE AND LIGHTHOUSE LABS WHICH ARE USUALLY AVAILABLE IN CITIES WITH BIG STARTUP COMMUNITIES LIKE LA NEW YORK AND VANCOUVER AT LEAST THEN YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING

AS FAR AS LEARNING BEST PRACTICES SUPER IMPORTANT AT LEAST FOR ME SINCE YOU CAN TEACH SYNTAX I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING THAT WILL BE DEEPLY UNPOPULAR ON THIS FORUM PYTHON IS A TERRIBLE LEARNING LANGUAGE THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO FRAMEWORKS IN WIDE USE DURANGO AND FLASK FLASK IS A SO IT DOESN'T REALLY TEACH YOU BEST PRACTICES AT ALL THAT SAID WE USE FLASK AT WORK SO THERE'S THAT DURANGO IS SET UP IN A TOTALLY DIFFERENT FASHION FROM ANY OTHER LANGUAGE'S FRAMEWORKS AND IS EXTREMELY OPAQUE IT DOES A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT BUT THE WAY IT DOES THOSE THINGS IS HIDDEN FROM YOU THE PROGRAMMER SO INSTEAD OF LEARNING THE RIGHT WAY TO PROGRAM YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN THE RIGHT WAY TO PROGRAM DURANGO WHICH WON'T HELP YOU AS A GENERAL PROGRAMMER AT ALL

IF YOU'RE COMING IN WITH NO EDUCATION YOU SHOULD TRY AND MAKE YOURSELF EMPLOYABLE BY AS MANY EMPLOYERS AS POSSIBLE AND THAT MEANS LEARNING LANGUAGES THAT EVERYONE USES THE PYTHON COMMUNITY IS TINY GENERALLY THE ONLY GOOD REASON TO USE PYTHON IS IF YOUR COMPANY DOES SOMETHING THAT NEEDS VERY EFFICIENT COMPUTING LIKE AI OR SEARCH I'M LOOKING AT GOOGLE AND AMAZON HERE WE USE PYTHON BECAUSE WE WANT TO USE MORE AI IN OUR SOLUTION IN ORDER TO CAST AS WIDE A NET AS POSSIBLE YOU SHOULD LEARN JAVASCRIPT AND PHS EVERYONE USES JAVASCRIPT AND PHS RUNS SOMETHING LIKE OF THE INTERNET CARAVEL IS A GREAT PHS FRAMEWORK THAT WILL VERY QUICKLY TEACH YOU BEST PRACTICES IT'S A GOOD SIGN OF HOW GREAT THAT FRAMEWORK IS WHEN PEOPLE START WRITING FRAMEWORKS IN OTHER LANGUAGES AND CALL THEIR SOLUTIONS THE CARAVEL OF NODE ADONISES

FOR JAVASCRIPT THERE ARE TWO MAIN TECHNOLOGIES PEOPLE USE REACTS AND ANGULAR REACTS IS A LIBRARY WHEREAS ANGULAR IS A FRAMEWORK SO I'D SUGGEST LEARNING ANGULAR 2 SINCE IT'S HARDER TO CODE THE WRONG WAY USING THAT SOLUTION REACTS IS GREAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT IT'S EASIER TO HANG YOURSELF BECAUSE IT'S LESS RESTRICTIVE THE ANGULAR COMMUNITY IS ALSO WAY WAY BIGGER THAN ALTHOUGH REACT IS GROWING SO THAT WHOLE GO WHERE THE JOBS ARE PHILOSOPHY ALSO APPLIES

THE VERY BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TO WRITE A VERY SMALL APP AND OPEN SOURCE IT USING GITHUB SO THAT YOU SHOW POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS THAT YOU CAN MAKE SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND CODE IT RIGHT DON'T WORRY ABOUT ORIGINALITY WRITE A LIST THAT FAMILIES CAN USE TO KEEP TRACK OF WHICH GROCERIES THEY NEED OR SOMETHING HOST IT ON AMAZON'S OR GET A MONTH DIGITAL OCEAN BOX AND HOST IT THERE DON'T GET CARRIED AWAY HERE JUST WRITE THE SIMPLEST THING YOU CAN IMAGINE AND PUT IT IN A PLACE WHERE EMPLOYERS CAN SEE IT WRITING SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND HOSTING IT ON GITHUB WHERE I CAN SEE THAT YOU'VE USED BEST PRACTICES WILL PUT YOU MILES AHEAD OF EVEN PEOPLE WITH UNIVERSITY DEGREES
APPLY FOR ENTRY LEVEL JOBS AND ACCEPT A CUT RATE YOU'LL GET SOMETHING

LOL NEW ERA OF PROGRAMMING
THERE'S ALREADY RSS AND I THINK THERE ARE APPS OUT THERE THAT FARM USE PICTURES FROM SITES SO WHY NOT CODE

THIS IS A JOKE THOUGH ISN'T IT THAT ASIDE I STILL THINK IT COULD BE USEFUL FOR LEARNING
EVERYONE AGREES THAT THIS IS BOTH FUNNY AND EPIC HOWEVER IT'S KIND OF A NICE THOUGHT TO TRY TO STANDARDIZE OUR MAIN REPOSITORY OF CODE EXAMPLES SO THAT THEY ARE ALL REASONABLY CONSISTENT IN THEIR PRESENTATION AND EVEN SO THAT THEY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN A GENERIC WAY WITHOUT MODIFICATION

I DON'T SEE IT BEING SO USEFUL IN AN ACTUAL PROJECT SO MUCH BUT I CAN IMAGINE SOME KIND OF PLUGGING THAT IMPORT AND DISPLAY CHUNKS OF CODE FROM SO ESPECIALLY IN SOME KIND OF SPECIALIZED ENVIRONMENT LIKE JUPITER NOTEBOOK

A LOT OF THESE TYPES OF TOOLS ALREADY EXIST AS REFERENCE MATERIALS WITHOUT ACTUALLY EVALUATING THE CODE AT ALL
DELETED
THIS IS PROBABLY GOOD AS A LEARNING EXPERIMENT AND THE IDEA IS CERTAINLY INTERESTING

SORTS RET AND RETURNS NONE YOU WANT SORTED RET TO GET THE SORTED LIST AS A NEW VALUE ALSO POST QUESTIONS IN R LEARNPYTHON NEXT TIME
TRY SORTED RET AS YOUR TEST CONDITION ALSO CONSIDER RETURNING A LIST COMPREHENSION LIKE THIS


RETURN WORD FOR WORD IN IF LEN WORD N
STR IS A SPECIAL WORD SO EVEN IF THIS ISN'T THE CAUSE DON'T USE IT LIKE THAT IT'S THE CLASS THAT DEFINES THE BEHAVIOUR OF STRINGS AND USING IT LIKE THIS MIGHT GIVE SURPRISING RESULTS IN SOME SITUATIONS

THE REASON YOUR COMPARISON DOESN'T WORK IS THAT SORTS RET IN PLACE AND RETURNS NOTHING WELL ACTUALLY NONE WHICH OBVIOUSLY ISN'T EQUAL TO A LIST OF ANY SORT AS U DEATHTOSPIES SAYS BELOW SORTED RET IS WHAT YOU WANT WHICH RETURNS A SORTED VERSION OF THE LIST
A PACKAGE IS WORTH IT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE PACKAGE MATURE AND THE GITHUB RELATED TO IT SHOWS RECENT ACTIVITY

LONG TIME ARG PARSE USER CLICK IS BETTER

THE GUY BEHIND PENDULUM IS REALLY PUSHING IT I THINK IT WILL BE PREFERRED OVER ARROW

IN THE END IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO WRITE QUALITY CODE THAN WHICH PACKAGE YOU USE FOR IT GRANTED YOU SHOULD NOT PUT TOO CRITICAL PARTS OF YOUR APP BACKED BY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT BEEN USED IN PRODUCTION BEFORE

PERHAPS JUST BRING THE TEAM TOGETHER AND LET THEM ARGUE THEIR PREFERENCE END UP WITH A PREFERRED PACKAGES LIST

SELENIUM THROUGH PYTHON ALLOWS YOU TO AUTOMATE A BROWSER INSTANCES


FIRST THING IS TO LOOK AT THE WEBSITE TO SEE HOW IT HANDLES THE VIN NUMBERS IF IT ISN'T USING JAVASCRIPT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE REQUESTS BUT IF IT DOES USE JS THEN YOU WOULD NEED TO USE SELENIUM

SETTING UP SELENIUM CAN BE A LITTLE TRICKY BUT ONCE IT'S GOING SHOULD BE QUITE EASY

FEEL FREE TO PM IF YOU NEED HELP
LOOK AT REQUESTS MODULE IT REALLY DOESN'T GET MUCH EASIER TO HIT THE API THE ONLY NEED YOU HAVE IS TO FILL THE API INPUT PIECES YOU GET BACK

REQUESTS
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS ON SAFERCAR I JUST CHECKED THE SITE AND IT USES RECAPTCHA WHICH IS USED TO PREVENT AUTOMATION LIKE THIS TO AUTOMATE IT YOU NEED TO AUTOMATE RECAPTCHA WHICH DMK ISN'T PUBLICLY BROKEN

OTHERWISE WHAT I WOULD DO IS DOWNLOAD FIREBOX AND GET THE TAMPERDATA EXTENSION THEN YOU GO DO IT MANUALLY AND LOOK AT TAMPERDATA AND WHAT CALLS IT MADE MIGHT LOOK LIKE A POST TO API CHECK-IN OR SOMETHING THEN YOU JUST WRITE SOMETHING TO DO THAT IN PYTHON WITH THE REQUESTS MODULE

BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT HERE DUE TO RECAPTCHA IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING THIS SITE

MAYBE SITE I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ONE IF IT USES RECAPTCHA THOUGH THEY PREVENT AUTOMATION

WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE DEATHTIME MODULE IS BEYOND ME
I LONG GAVE UP ON ATTEMPTING TO WRITE FILES BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET RIGHT SO I JUST ALWAYS COPY ONE I KNOW WORKS AND EDIT THE NAME VERSION DEPENDENCIES
I HAVE ONE DECORATOR IN PARTICULAR THAT I USE A LOT CALLED ACCUMULATE IT BASICALLY LETS YOU PULL APART EXPRESSIONS THAT USE GENERATORS AND ITERATORS INTO FUNCTIONS AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I USE IT FOR I HAVE SOME COMPLICATED GENERATOR EXPRESSION THAT LOOKS LIKE N JOIN SOME COMPLICATED STUFF AND I WANT TO MAKE IT A FUNCTION WITHOUT EITHER A TEMPORARY RESULT VARIABLE OR A WRAPPER FUNCTION

IT'S VERY VERY SIMPLE BUT IT'S JUST SO APPLICABLE EVERYWHERE IT WORKS LIKE THIS


DEF FILES EXT O

WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME AS

DEF FILES EXT O

RETURN RESULT

THE ISSUE I HAD WAS THAT I HATED WRITING FUNCTIONS LIKE THE LATTER BECAUSE THE TEMPORARY ACCUMULATOR OR RESULT VARIABLE IS HORRIBLE BUT I DON'T ALWAYS WANT A FUNCTION THAT RETURNS A GENERATOR ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNOW THAT I AM ALWAYS GOING TO BE IMMEDIATELY CONSUMING THE GENERATOR WITH THE SAME FUNCTION THE OTHER OPTION IS TO ALWAYS WRITE A WRAPPER SO I WROTE THIS INCREDIBLY SIMPLE AND YET SO USEFUL DECORATOR

I'VE GOT A FEW FUNCTIONS THAT I USE FOR HITTING MY POSTURES DATABASES I PASS IN A SQL QUERY AND A LIST OF PARAMETERS AND THE FUNCTIONS TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDING AVOIDING SQL INJECTION AND THE LIKES

EFFECTIVE PYTHON WAS A TURNING POINT IN MY PYTHON CAREER WHAT AN EXCELLENT BOOK START TO FINISH IT'S LIKE THE BOOK RAYMOND HETTINGER WOULD WRITE
I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON I STARTED IT RECENTLY AND I CAN SAY IT'S GREAT SO FAR
THE FIRST ONE IS VERY GOOD NOT TOO HARD FOR BEGINNERS NOT TOO EASY FOR ADVANCED READERS JUST RIGHT
OFFICE NEIGHBORS COMMENT

WHY DOES THE PYTHON BOOK HAVE A LIZARD ON IT



LOOKS GREAT I'M QUITE HAPPY THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY
THE FLASK BOOK IS SO GOOD
IF WE ARE RECOMMENDING PYTHON RESOURCES I'LL ADD PETER COURSE DESIGN OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS ON AUDACITY I THINK THAT'S STILL THE BEST ONLINE COURSE I EVER TOOK
THE MACHINE LEARNING ONE GOOD ENTRY POINT
IVE LOVED TWO SCOOPS OF DURANGO SINCE THE START WISH THEY MADE A BOOK LIKE THIS FOR EXPRESS OR HASKELL SNAP IT'S ALL ABOUT BEST PRACTICES WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO NOT LOOKING LIKE A COMPLETE BOOB
I HAVE FOUR OF THE BOOKS ON THIS LIST THE ONLY BOOK I'M NOT REALLY A FAN OF DATA VISUALISATION WITH PYTHON AND JAVASCRIPT JUST DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE THE BEST THOUGHT IN PRESENTING THE CONTENT WITHIN EACH OF THE CHAPTERS CONSIDERING THERE ARE PLENTY OF BLOGS REGARDING DATA VISUALISATION AND PYTHON I CAN'T REALLY RECOMMENCED IT


FLUENT PYTHON IS REALLY GREAT BOOK DEFINITELY NOT A BOOK FOR A COMPLETE PROGRAMMING NEWCOMER BUT READING THE BOOK REALLY MADE ME APPRECIATE WHAT COULD BE DONE WITH PYTHON AND JUST HOW ELEGANT THE LANGUAGE CAN BE
AS SOMEONE WHO JUST STARTED PYTHON AS THEIR FIRST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WHICH ONE OF THESE BOOKS WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO ME OP I'M LEARNING PYTHON FOR DEVONS PURPOSES
ALL GREAT BOOKS ESPECIALLY FLUENT PYTHON AND FLASK
I WANT TO BE WEBDEV PYTHON DO I NEED TO READ ALL THIS BOOK OR JUST AND
SO MANY GREAT BOOKS ABOUT PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON
AM ONLY I MISSING PYTHON HERE
I HAVE MOST OF THESE AND I AGREE
GROKKING ALGORITHMS IS BRAND NEW BUT SO FAR THE REVIEWS SEEM INCREDIBLY FAVORABLE IT SEEMS LIKE A USEFUL ADDITION TO THIS LIST
WONDER IF THE SITE USES PYTHON ON THE BACK END BECAUSE THEN THEY MIGHT WANT TO READ A BOOK ON SERVER LOAD AND CONNECTION CACHING ISSUES TO A DB

ERROR ESTABLISHING A DATABASE CONNECTION

EDIT NOPE IT IS WORDPRESS KICKS TO A LOGIN SOMEONE NEEDS TO INSTALL A CACHING PUGIN BACK UP FOR ME NOW AND A GREAT LIST
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE ARTICLE BUT ARE THESE BOOKS MAINLY FOCUSED ON PYTHON 2 OR
WHAT IS THE GENERAL CONSENSUS ON LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY
I AM MISSING THIS ONE

DP


FIRST ONE IS GOOD
HACKERS GUIDE TO PYTHON FOR ADVANCED DEVELOPER
I OWN BOTH THE TWO SCOOPS AND PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING AND BOTH ARE SADLY OUTDATED NOT RECOMMENDED PURCHASES
FLUENT PYTHON IS OUTSTANDING THOUGH
MUST READ BOOKS TO LEARN PYTHON COME THE FUCK ON ONE OR TWO BOOKS SHOULD DO

EDIT COMMENTS NOTED I APOLOGIZE FOR MY USE OF BAD WORDS AND FOR IMPLYING THE BOOKS WERE ABOUT LEARNING PYTHON HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER A MUST READ BOOK ABOUT CODING TO BE SOMETHING OTHER THAN LEARNING ABOUT THAT CODE OK THEY'RE NOT ALL BUY THAT TOO WAS IMPLIED IN THE TITLE
ULTIMATELY I STAND BY MY FIRST AND THIRD SENTENCES THE SECOND WAS NOT MEANT TO OFFEND BUT TO SHOW MY SURPRISE OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF TITLE
WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE THIS APPLIED TO HOUSE PRICES INSTEAD OF RENTING PRICES
WHEN I FIRST SAW THE BEDROOMS I WAS LIKE ALRIGHT THIS GUYS A TOTAL SCRUB HIS ML IMPLEMENTATION OR DATA IS WHACK WHATA BOOB LULA


BUT THEN I READ WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT STUDIOS AND REALIZED THAT MADE A LOT OF SENSE AFTER REFLECTING ON MY TIME APARTMENT HUNTING AS A BERKELEY STUDENT ESPECIALLY IN BERKELEY OF BEDROOMS DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN CONSIDER A LUXURY PENTHOUSE STUDIO ON SHATTUCK VS A DUMP MAINTAINED BY AN ABSENTEE LANDLORD ON SOUTH SIDE QUALITY I'D ASSUME IS A CONFOUNDING FACTOR THAT CONFUSES THE RELATIONSHIP SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF THE TEXT MIGHT BE INTERESTING


ANYWAY NICE JOB ENJOYED THE ARTICLE IT WAS WELL WRITTEN RESEARCHED IMPLEMENTED
FUNNY HOW THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN SOMEONE DO A WRITE UP ON ANALYZING RENT AND FINDING DEALS IN THE BAY AREA IN R PYTHON NO LESS HOUSING THERE IS SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS
SELENIUM IS A HAVE PACKAGE SAVES ME LITERALLY OF WORK EVERY WEEK
DONT PUT COLOR CODES IN PYTHON USE CSS CLASS NAMES
HOW IS THIS ANY DIFFERENT THAN JUST USING THE OR OPERATOR THAT ALREADY EXISTS

A B D NONE
C
V A OR B OR C OR D

IS THE PROPOSAL SUGGESTING THAT

FOO EXISTS BAR ELSE BAZ

SHOULD BE EQUIVALENT TO

FOO BAR IF EXISTS BAR ELSE BAZ

BIG EDIT SWIPE TO TYPE MADE MY IS AND I'D NOW IT'S BACK TO IS
EXISTS FOO ELSE BAR

WHY NOT EXISTS FOO ELSE BAR OR PERHAPS EXISTS FOO ELSE BAR FOR CONSISTENCY
NOT REALLY A FAN OF THE SYNTAX I'D EXPECT EXISTS FOO ELSE BAR TO EVALUATE TO THE RETURN VALUE OF EXISTS FOO IF EXISTS FOO IS TRUE TO BE HONEST HERE I THINK ADDING A NEW OPERATOR OR AN EXISTING ONE WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE FOO BAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT READS A LOT BETTER
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF OVERLOADING ELSE ONCE MORE IT'S ALREADY COMPLICATED FOR NEW DEVELOPERS TO UNDERSTAND THE TRY EXCEPT ELSE OR FOR ELSE CONSTRUCTIONS
WELL THAT IS A BIT ADDING ANOTHER OPERATOR SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS SO SINFUL ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT REUSING ELSE AGAIN AFTER IT HAS EXISTENCE IN FOLLOWING IF BLOCKS FOR BLOCKS WHILE BLOCKS TRY EXCEPT BLOCKS AND INLINE IF STATEMENTS KEEPING TRACK OF DIFFERENT USAGES OF A SINGLE KEYWORD IS A BIT INSANE

THE NEW PROTOCOL APPROACH HOWEVER IS QUITE INVALUABLE AND SOLVES ALL THE ISSUES OF THE PRIOR APPROACH AND IS SOMEWHAT INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SYNTAX TOO DAMN SHAME

EDIT IT ALSO SEEMS TO SAY THAT NULL PROPAGATION WILL WORK BUT DOESN'T SEEM TO SUGGEST ANY METHOD BY HOW IT WOULD WORK WHICH IS SOMEWHAT FAR LESS USEFUL THAN THE PRIOR PROPOSAL
IT'S EARLY AND I'M PROBABLY MISREADING THIS BUT WOULD

IF X AS Y

WORK FOR THIS ADAMIK SUCH A FEATURE IS NOT IMPLEMENTED BUT IT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO TEST THE CONDITION AND ASSIGN IT IN THE SAME LINE PLUS THIS FOLLOWS THE ALREADY USED SYNTAX OF

WITH OPEN AS F
I'D RATHER USE RUBY'S INLINE RESCUE

RESCUE NIL

WHY NOT X PREFER A B C RATHER THAN X A ELSE B ELSE C

THAT TO ME LOOKS WAY MORE PYTHONIC AND ELIMINATES ALL THE THAT IS CURRENTLY GOING ON
I THINK I LIKE THIS BETTER THAN
BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE REMOVE THE ATTEMPTED AUTODETECTION OF REQUIREMENT NAMES FROM BURLS BURLS MUST INCLUDE A NAME VIA

IS THIS SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO EGGS OR ANY NRL USED AS A SOURCE IN REQUIREMENTS
HERE'S THE ANNOUNCEMENT BY U DONALDSTUFFT ON

PIPERMAIL NOVEMBER

THIS RELEASE FEATURES

THE X SERIES WILL BE THE LAST PIP VERSIONS TO SUPPORT PYTHON
SUPPORT FOR WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN SETUPTOOLS PEPI TO ALLOW RELEASING ODISTS THAT WILL BE IGNORED BY SPECIFIC VERSIONS OF PYTHON EAST G FOOBAR X DOESN T GET DOWNLOADED ON
ABILITY TO PASS PLATFORM PYTHON VERSION IMPLEMENTATION ETC INTO PIP DOWNLOAD TO DOWNLOAD WHEELS FOR OTHER PLATFORMS
ADD A PICK CHECK COMMAND TO CHECK THE STATE OF INSTALLED DEPENDENCIES
ADD NEW FORMATS FOR PIP LIST INCLUDING A NEW COLUMNAR LAYOUT AND A JASON FORMAT FOR EASE OF SCRIPTING
CAN WE UPGRADE ALL OUTDATED PACKAGES WITH A SIMPLE COMMAND
I WISH WE COULD GET ROLLED IN TO PIP
CAN I UPGRADE A PACKAGE THAT IS ALREADY INSTALLED TO A SPECIFIC VERSION THAT ISN'T THE LATEST VERSION
UNINSTALLED EXISTING PACKAGES WHEN PERFORMING AN EDITABLE INSTALLATION OF THE SAME PACKAGES

THE OLD BEHAVIOUR HAS BEEN BUGGING ME FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW I'M SO HAPPY THEY FIXED IT

I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT IF YOU ARE STILL DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE LACK OF REGEL SEARCH SIZE LICENSE AND UPLOAD DATE INDICATOR IN PIP SEARCH OR JUST WANT TO HAVE NICE FORMATTING COLORS AND INTERACTIVE MENU YOU SHOULD DEFENIETLY CHECK OUT YIP
I WOULD LOVE IT IF PIP WAS AWARE OF RPM DATABASES AND WOULD THROW AN ERROR IF A PACKAGE TRIED TO OVERWRITE SOMETHING OWNED BY AN RPM
CHECK OUT
USE AIOHTTP AND ASYNCIO WITH THE NEW ASYNC AWAIT SYNTAX IT'S SO EASY
TRY ITS THE FASTEST HETP CLIENT FOR PYTHON AIOHTTP STOPS AT RPS WHILE HUMAN CURL CAN PUSH WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS ALSO THE INTERFACE IS LIKE REQUESTS THATS A NICE BONUS
I WROTE SOME SOFTWARE THAT SCALES INTO THE MILLIONS USING EVENT AND REQUESTS ONE REALLY NICE THING ABOUT THIS APPROACH IS THAT YOU CAN WRITE ALL OF YOUR AUTHENTICATION LOGIC IN YOUR CASE SYNCHRONOUSLY AS IF YOU ONLY NEED TO MAKE A SINGLE CONNECTION THEN YOU SPAWN THAT INTO GREENLETS OR A GREENLET POOL TO SET CONCURRENCY LIMITS AND WAIT FOR THEM TO COMPLETE

HOW MUCH YOU CAN SCALE A SINGLE PROCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS EXPECTED RESPONSE TIMES CPU TIME ETC ETC FOR MY PURPOSES RESPONSE TIME MEASUREMENTS ARE CRITICAL SO I LIMIT MYSELF TO ABOUT GREENLETS PER PROCESS THEN SCALE MY PROCESSES HORIZONTALLY ACROSS CPU CORES IN OTHER CASES IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO SCALE A PROCESS INTO THE THOUSANDS OR OF THOUSANDS

EDIT RE REQUESTS IT APPEARS TO BE A VERY SIMPLE WRAPPER API I WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH IT PERSONALLY JUST

FROM EVENT IMPORT POOL
FROM EVENT IMPORT QUEUE
DEF WORK TASK Q

Q
P LIMIT
FOR TASK IN TASKS
WORK TASK Q


INCIDENTALLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO EVERYTHING IF THERE'S JUST SOME SPECIFIC MODULE YOU WANT TO USE EVENT WITH IT'S JUST AWFULLY CONVENIENT IN A MODULE WHERE YOU ONLY EXPECT TO DO IO WITH EVENT
ARE YOU SIMPLY LOOKING FOR AN HETP BENCHMARKING TOOL OR DOES IT NEED TO BE WRITTEN IN PYTHON

IF NOT I'VE USED APACHE METER THOUGH IT IS SLIGHTLY CONFUSING TO SETUP IT DOES MAKE USEFUL CHARTS AND TABLES
HOW DO YOU KNOW WON'T SCALE PARTICULARLY IF YOU DECREASE THE THREAD STACK SIZE WITH THREADING SIZE WHEN YOU SAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR MILLIONS DO YOU MEAN AT ONCE OR IN TOTAL MY GUESS IS THAT THAT MANY AT ONCE WOULD BE HARD BY ANY MEANS ESPECIALLY IN PYTHON BUT IF IT'S ONLY THOUSANDS AT ONCE I THINK THREADING MIGHT BE FINE

ALSO HAVE YOU CONSIDERED AN EXISTING TOOL LIKE SIEGE
I WOULDN'T USE ASYNC AT ALL ONE TINY MISTAKE SUCH AS TAKING IN A FUNCTION CALL AND YOU CAN KISS YOUR PERFORMANCE GOODBYE FURTHERMORE THREADING OR ASYNC IF YOUR ROUTINES ARE CPU BOUND MEANING YOU'RE TAKING TOO MUCH COMPUTATION YOU'RE HOSED IN PYTHON YOU WILL ONLY EVER USE ONE OF YOUR CORES DUE TO THE GIL

SO HERE'S MY SUGGESTION

I WOULD GO THREADING ALL THE WAY START YOUR BACKEND SERVERS HANDLING THREADS EACH START THEM ALL ON THE SAME MACHINE LISTENING ON DIFFERENT PORTS PUT APACHE IN FRONT OF THEM AND LOAD BALANCE X OF THEM IT IS TRIVIALLY EASY TO SET UP APACHE TO BE A LOAD BALANCER HERE'S HOW TO DO IT

PROXY BALANCER MYCLUSTER
BALANCERMEMBER HETP
BALANCERMEMBER HETP


PROXYPASS TEST BALANCER MYCLUSTER
PROXYPASSREVERSE TEST BALANCER MYCLUSTER

THEN IF YOU NEED MORE CAPACITY SPIN UP MORE BACKENDS

BY THE WAY YOU ARE USING SGI RIGHT
SCALES VERY WELL IF YOU ARE STUCK IN
IS GREAT AND CAN DO ORDERED REQUESTS BASED ON A CONFIT FILE
ASYNC HETP CLIENT IS VERY FAST AND ABOUT AS SIMPLE AS ASYNC GETS LOTS OF EXAMPLES AROUND THE WEB CHECK IT OUT SEE IF IT WILL WORK FOR YOU
FLASK MYSEL USES PYMYSQL TO CONNECT WITH MYSEL CHECK OUT THIS EXAMPLE PROJECT
IF YOU NEED BLAZING CPU SPEED PYTHON IS THE WRONG LANGUAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU NEED C OR C OR GO OR D FOR THAT KIND OF THING

ONCE YOU HAVE PROTOTYPED YOU ALGORITHM IN PYTHON YOU CAN SELECTIVELY PUSH THE PARTS THAT NEED SPEED DOWN IN TO ONE OF THE FAST LANGUAGES
FROM THE LINK IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO USE PYTHON FOR AES MODERN CPUS HAVE AN HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION WHICH IS SUPER FAST

THE BENCHMARK SHOWS THAT PYTHON IS SLOWER WHEN USING AN UNREALISTIC NUMBER OF INT VARIABLES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DO IN PYTHON ANYWAY THE SAME CHANGES MIGHT HELP OTHER THINGS REALLY IT'S ONLY TALKING ABOUT USING A LONG FOR INT IN WHICH IS A FAIRLY UNINTERESTING DISCUSSION TO MOST LINKED WRITING ALSO STATES THAT OTHER BENCHMARKS SHOW A NEGLIGIBLE DIFFERENCE
ALL THE SLOWER ONES ARE SLOWER

NOTICE THAT A THIRD OF THE BENCHMARKS ARE FASTER AND ONE OF THEM IS FASTER WHILE THE WORST SLOWDOWN IS


ALSO NOT THAT IN PYTHON MORE CODE I EAST IS NOT BOOBY-TRAPPED WITH LATENT BUGS RIDDLE THROUGH THE CODE
WHERE DID YOU EVEN GET THAT TITLE FROM
STRONG UNDERNAME
ANY PLACE I CAN SUBSCRIBE FOR LICLIPSE NEWS

LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SWITCH TO ELINT SINCE JOSHING DOESN'T WORK WITH

IT DOES HAVE ONE NEW FEATURE IN WHICH CTRL SHIFT O WHICH FIXES UNRESOLVED TOKENS BY ADDING THE NEEDED IMPORTS USES THE IMPROVED SORTING ALSO USED FOR THE SO THAT TOKENS FROM THE PROJECT APPEAR BEFORE TOKENS FROM OTHER PROJECTS WHICH IN TURN APPEAR BEFORE TOKENS FROM THE STANDARD LIBRARY ALSO THE SUBSTRING COMPLETION IS NOW ON BY DEFAULT IT MAY BE TURNED OFF IN THE PREFERENCES

CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT PYCHARM CAN'T ACTUALLY DO THIS CORRECT IT'S PRETTY FRUSTRATING TO DO MANUALLY SO I'D LOVE TO KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY INTELLIJ WITH JAVA IS ABLE TO DO AUTOMATIC ORDERING SORTING OF IMPORTS CORRECTLY
CHECK OUT R LEARNPYTHON
OR EVEN LOOK AT THE SIDEBAR ONLINE BOOKS AND RESOURCES
STEP READ THE TUTORIALS ON THE PYTHON WEBSITE THIS WILL EXPLAIN LANGUAGE BASICS

STEP 2 O'REILLY BOOKS ARE USUALLY GOOD BUT THE FIRST AND ONLY PYTHON BOOK I READ WAS THE ESSENTIAL REFERENCE LIBRARY CONTAINS A GOOD AMOUNT SO THAT YOU CAN SEE HOW THE LANGUAGE WORKS AND PREPARES YOU FOR PICKING UP NEW MATERIAL

STEP PICK A MODULE AND START LEARNING IT YOU DONT HAVE TO BECOME A PRO BUT IT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT GOES INTO LEARNING NEW TOOLS IN PYTHON MY FIRST ONE WAS SOCKET AND MY FIRST REAL PROJECT WAS A JSONRPC SERVER YOU CAN FIND THE GLOBAL MODULE INDEX ON THE PYTHON WEBSITE

STEP FIND NEW TECHNOLOGIES WITHIN PYTHON THAT CAN HELP YOU ACCOMPLISH A GOAL YOU WANT I STARTED BUILDING A HOME AUTOMATION PACKAGE BUT I ABANDONED THIS AS THERE ARE ALREADY SUFFICIENT PROJECTS OUT THERE IT TAUGHT ME A LOT LIKE WORKING WITH DATABASES MULTIPROCESSING QUEUES AND CONFIGURATION FILES

LEARNING BY PRACTICE

OR SIMILAR

BUT CHECK-IN IS DEDICATED TO PYTHON MOSTLY WITH SUPPORT FOR BUMPY OR OTHER LIBRARIES

OR TRY

I WOULD START WITH SELENIUM OR REQUESTS
REQUESTS IS RAN HEADLESS AND SELENIUM YOU CAN WATCH IT HAPPEN ON SCREEN
IN PYTHON
RUN PYTHON SCRIPT EVERYDAY
GET MAILS
EXTRACT ATTACHMENT
UNZIP FILE
AND THEN USE THIS WITH CLI AND PYTHON SUBPROCESS
WHEN IT'S DONE ZIP THE FOLDER AGAIN AND THEN THERE ARE TWO SOLUTIONS
EITHER USE SELENIUM TO SIMULATE A FORM REQUEST OR YOU CAN TRY SOMETHING SIMPLER GO THROUGH CHROME AND POST THAT FORM WITH THE DEVELOPERS TOOLS ON NETWORK TAB OPEN RIGHT CLICK ON THE POST REQUEST AND COPY THE CURL COMMAND YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT
YOU CAN HIT ME UP ON DEER AND WE CAN DISCUSS THIS JOB IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO WRITE IT FOR YOU
THIRD ONLINE RESOURCE DOWN IN THE NAVAR HELP MENU FOR THIS SUBREDDIT COVERS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU ASKED

PIECING IT ALL TOGETHER MAY BE ANOTHER KETTLE OF FISH ALL TOGETHER
REGARDING YOUR FIRST QUESTION WHY NOT JUST CREATE A VIEW AND THEN PUT A MODEL ON TOP OF THAT ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SET THE TO POINT AT THE NAME AND DEFINE THE COLUMNS AS YOU WOULD FOR ANY TABLE

AS FAR AS YOUR SECOND QUESTION FOR RETRIEVING THE EQUIVALENT OF A CASE STATEMENT BOOLEAN I THINK THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT YOU CAN USE IT TO ADD CALCULATED PROPERTIES
BASED ON YOUR DESCRIPTION I MIGHT DROP THE USE OF THE TERM MESH AS IT HAS A SPECIFIC MEANING IN NETWORKING THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT LIKELY CONFLICTS WITH THE REALITY OF THE WAY YOUR APPLICATION WILL BE DESIGNED

SEE

SOCIAL MEDIA AGGREGATOR MIGHT BE A MORE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION

OFFHAND I'D ASSUME THE DESIGN SHOULD LIKELY BE A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD PROCESS OF DOWNLOADING POSTS FROM THE SUPPLIED BY THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES ALONG WITH ANY METADATA POSSIBLY EXTRACTING SOME OF YOUR OWN METADATA FROM THE POST IF IT ISN'T PROVIDED STORING IT TO FILE OR A DATABASE IN SOME WAY AND THEN REPRESENTING THAT DATA HOWEVER YOU WISH IN THE GUI OF YOUR APPLICATION

I'M NOT CERTAIN AS TO SPECIFIC LIBRARIES AND THINGS THAT YOU WOULD USE THERE ARE LIKELY PYTHON LIBRARIES ALREADY AVAILABLE SPECIFICALLY FOR INTERACTING WITH THESE SERVICES WHICH SHOULD MAKE THE JOB OF AUTHENTICATING AND PULLING THE POSTS DOWN FAIRLY EASY


PRACTICAL BUSINESS PYTHON HETP IS HELPFUL READING THROUGH THE DOCS MAY BE YOUR BEST BET PANDAS HAS MULTIPLE METHODS THAT COMPLETE OPERATIONS AS AN EXAMPLE

TEXT TO COLUMNS
DATAFRAME COLUMN EXPAND TRUE
STABLE

PIVOT TABLES
AAG COLUMN SUM
STABLE



EXCEL CONCEPTS DON'T DIRECTLY TRANSLATE TO PANDAS IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT TOOL WITH A DIFFERENT PROGRAMMING MODEL APPROACH IT LIKE THAT AND LEARN THE IDIOMATIC WAYS OF DOING THINGS IT'LL MAKE THINGS A LOT EASIER FOR YOU IN THE LONG RUN
HAVE YOU WATCHED SOME OF THE VIDEOS FROM THE PEDATA AND LYCON CONFERENCES ON PANDAS IN PARTICULAR BRANDON RHODES HAS MADE SOME INSPIRED VIDEO TUTORIALS
AND OF COURSE BLOWINGS CAN BE PART OF THE MIX IT HELPS YOU INTERACTING WITH A RUNNING EXCEL INSTANCE
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WRITING DECORATORS WITH CLASSES INSTEAD OF FUNCTIONS IS EXPLAINED IMO CLASS BASED DECORATORS MAKE MORE SENSE IF YOU ARE WRITING A DECORATOR THAT TAKES ARGUMENTS AS YOU SPLIT THE DECORATOR AGS THE CLASS INIT METHOD AND THE FUNCTION WRAP CALL THE CLASS CALL METHOD YOU CAN ALSO CREATE PER WRAP VARIABLES USING THE DECORATOR CLASS ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS STILL A GOOD READ INTRODUCTION
IMO THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT DECORATORS IS THAT THEY ARE JUST FUNCTIONS WITH SOME SYNTACTIC SUGAR WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DECORATORS WORK THEY'RE USUALLY FIGURING OUT HOW CLOSURES WORK
THE BIGGEST SHORT COMING IN THIS ARTICLE IS THE LACK OF DISCUSSION ON USING OR WRAPS IT'S DECORATOR FORM USING DECORATORS TO MAKE BETTER DECORATORS HOW VERY META

THESE PRESERVE METADATA ABOUT THE ORIGINAL FUNCTION SUCH AS TO MAKE DEBUGGING EASIER OPTIONALLY IT CAN ALSO PROPAGATE ATTRIBUTE ACCESS FROM THE UNDERLYING THING

THESE TWO ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO WRITING GOOD DECORATORS
I'VE BEEN REALLY IMPRESSED WITH FOR SEVERAL REASONS

IT'S A MASSIVE CODEBASE BUT STILL MANAGES TO BE VERY WELL ORGANIZED IN SPITE OF THIS
2 THEIR DOCUMENTATION IS EXCELLENT IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO SEE WELL DOCUMENTED CODE TAKE A LOOK
SIMILAR TO NUMBER THE MODELS ARE WELL ORGANIZED WITH BASE CLASSES PULLING IN COMMONLY USED FUNCTIONS WITH SPECIALIZED CLASSES HANDLING MORE SPECIFIC MODELS SAY LOGISTIC REGRESSION FOR EXAMPLE
REDDIN ITSELF IS WRITTEN MOSTLY IN PYTHON
I'M A BIG FAN OF THE PYTHON ERROR STEAMROLLER TO QUOTE THE DOCS THIS MODULE IS LIKE VIOLENCE IF IT DOESN T WORK YOU JUST NEED MORE OF IT
THE WORST PYTHON CODE I'VE EVER SEEN

IT'S ACTUALLY REAL CODE BUT THE AUTHOR TOOK TO THE LETTER THE ADVICE THAT LESS LINES OF CODE MEANS MORE READABLE CODE AUTHOR IF YOU READ ME YOU'RE HORRIBLY WRONG AND I KEEP YOUR REPOSITORY WITH ME AT ALL TIME TO REMEMBER THE ATROCITIES THAT MANKIND IS CAPABLE OF
I THINK DURANGO IS VERY WELL DONE
NOT ON GITHUB BUT A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF PYTHON IMO HETP

I WAS LOOKING AT HYPER RECENTLY WHICH IS A PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW HETP 2 PROTOCOL IT'S REALLY INTERESTING FROM A CODE DESIGN POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE IT DELIBERATELY AVOIDS IMPLEMENTING THE ACTUAL I O PORTIONS SINCE YOU MAY WANT TO USE IT WITH AN ASYNCHRONOUS I O ENGINE LIKE TWISTED

THIS ALSO MAKES THE CODE MUCH EASIER TO WRITE TESTS FOR

2 THE DOCUMENTATION IS PARTICULARLY GOOD


ANYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH ARMIN RONDACHER SUCH AS FLASK
CONSTRUCT IS AN AMAZING PYTHON LIBRARY FOR HANDLING BINARY DATA I USED IT TO BUILD A PACKAGE TO PARSE PM DATA DATA FROM THE POKEMON GAMES THAT DETAILS INDIVIDUAL POKEMON IN YOUR PARTY AND PC BOXES LIKE THEIR DVS DEVS EXP WHAT BALL WAS USED TO CATCH THEM ETC IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO HANDLE DATA IN A DECLARATIVE WAY
THE REQUESTS LIBRARY

I TRIED USING THIS AS A BASE FOR A THING AT MY PREVIOUS WORK ENDED UP REWRITING THE WHOLE THING FROM SCRATCH BASICALLY MY VERSION HAD PROBLEMS TOO OFF COURSE SOME PRETTY BAD ONES BUT GOD IT WAS A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THAN THIS
PYRAMID
IS THE WORST CODEBASE I'VE EVER SEEN WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE THEY AIM FOR BETTER

ONELOGIN

LOOKS LIKE SOME JAVA PROGRAMMERS WERE TOLD THEY HAD TO ALSO SUPPORT PYTHON SO THEY RAN A TRANSPILER

IT'S MOSTLY UNDOCUMENTED SO DOING ANYTHING REQUIRES READING THE CODE

IF YOU NEED TO IMPORT ANYTHING BE PREPARED TO TYPE EVERYTHING TWICE EAST G FROM IMPORT

AND THIS IS THE LEAST TERRIBLE OPTION I FOUNDATION ANOTHER SAML LIB ALSO DEPENDED ON KEBOB COPE PASTE ETC BECAUSE IT PACKAGED A WEB APP AS A DEMO DESPITE THE ACTUAL PARSING LOGIC NOT NEEDING ANY OF THAT
I LIKE THE SIMPLICITY OF MKDOCS
NOT PYTHON BUT IS PRETTY DIFFICULT TO READ
I HAVE A COLLECTION OF BAD CODE EXAMPLES WHICH I FIND IN PROJECTS I AM WORKING WITH LIKE THIS ONE
I LIKE PYEPHEM IT HAS GREAT DOCUMENTATION AND THE AUTHOR IS SUPER NICE
IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION I GENERALLY WOULD PRINT DIRECTIONS ITSELF AND SEE WHAT ITS STRUCTURE IS LIKE

FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE YOUTUBE API YOU TEND TO GET STUFF THAT IS ANNOYINGLY NESTED

I'M GUESSING IT MIGHT BE A SIMILAR SITUATION JUST PRINT OUT DIRECTIONS AND IF ITS MINIFIED JASON ALL ON GIANT LINE USE AN ONLINE TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT IT

EDIT JUST TRIED IT MYSELF AND AS I THOUGHT ITS ONE GIANT LINE OF JASON WITH THE ELEMENT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR NEAR THE END

YOU ONLY REALLY NEED THE DISTANCE MATRIX API THOUGH

I'M DOING THIS IN PYTHON 2 SO ITS A BIT DIFFERENT FOR ME

FROM IMPORT CLIENT
FROM GOOGLEMAPS IMPORT

GAMPS CLIENT
DISTANCE GAMPS WHITE HOUSE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
PRINT DISTANCE

THAT SHOULD RETURN A MUCH SMALLER SNIPPET OF JASON TO WORK WITH

EDIT 2 I COULDN'T SLEEP BECAUSE OF THIS HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT

FROM IMPORT CLIENT
FROM GOOGLEMAPS IMPORT

GAMPS CLIENT
DATA GAMPS WHITE HOUSE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
DISTANCE DATA ROWS ELEMENTS DISTANCE TEXT
PRINT DISTANCE

THERE THAT GIVES THE DISTANCE
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON

HI I WOULD LIKE TO HELP
HAVING WORKED IN THE HOSTING INDUSTRY AND PLAYED AROUND WITH DURANGO I CAN AT LEAST GIVE YOU THE FOLLOWING EVEN THOUGH IT WON'T ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS

DURANGO PROVIDES A MANAGEMENT ADMIN INTERFACE SIMILAR IN CONCEPT TO WORDPRESS PROVIDED YOU'VE DESIGNED YOUR APP CORRECTLY IN THEORY THERE IS NO NEED TO EDIT CODE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADD ENTRIES FOR EXAMPLE ADDING A BLOG LIKE YOU DO IN WP THROUGH THE ADMIN PANEL

YES HOSTING SERVICES TYPICALLY SUPPORT PYTHON HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR HOST TO ENSURE THEY CAN SUPPORT DURANGO IF THAT'S THE ROUTE YOU GO AS IT NEEDS LAST I CHECKED ANYWAY YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO LOOK INTO VENDS IT WAS PRETTY COMMON FOR DURANGO TO BE INSTALLED IN SAY USR LIB ON OUR SERVER BUT BE TOO OLD FOR THE CLIENT ON SHARED SERVERS YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT CHANGED BUT A ENV GETS AROUND THIS AS YOU CAN INSTALL A DIFFERENT SET OF PACKAGES FOR JUST YOUR USER DEPLOYMENT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY WITH VENDS BUT YOU MAY NEED TO EDIT THE CONFIT FILE


I LIKE TO USE RESPONSES FOR THIS KIND OF STUFFS WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS ALLOW TO ASSERT ON HETP REQUESTS
I'VE USED CRAPY FOR THIS AORTA THING IN THE PAST
WOW THIS IS QUITE SOMETHING FUCK YOU IS NOT A GOOD RESPONSE TO DISTRIBUTIONS HAVING RULES AND OP IS NOT THE KIND OF PERSON THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED ANYWHERE NEAR CEBIAN REPOS IF THAT'S HOW THEY RESPOND TO THINGS
BLDR
TRY PYINSTALLER
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE APP CAN WE PIP INSTALL IT
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON ESPECIALLY IF YOU POST WITH FORMATTED CODE USE SPACES AND READ THE SIDEBAR AND HAVE MORE FINITE QUESTION
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PART YOU'RE MISSING
JUST A SMALL NOTE YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT HOW YOU POST CODE INTO THIS FORUM AS YOU KNOW FORMATTING AND WHITESPACE ARE CRITICAL IN PYTHON AND AS POSTED YOUR CODE WONT RUN AS IT IS NOT INDENTED CORRECTLY YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ UP THE FORMATTING AND EDIT YOUR POST ABOVE HINT EVERY CODE LINE HAS TO BE INDENTED BY AT LEAST SPACES FOR THEM TO BE FORMATTED CORRECTLY WHEN POSTED

R LEARNPYTHON
IN THE PAST I THOUGHT THE SEDGEWICK BOOK ALGORITHMS IN C IS A KIND OF GOOD AND UNDERSTANDABLE INTRODUCTION BUT TO BE HONEST I THINK THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IS JUST WORKING ON A PRODUCT THAT FORCES YOU TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS THINK ABOUT REAL WORLD PROBLEMS LIKE HOW CAN I ENCAPSULATE DATA IN A WAY THAT I COMBINE THINGS WHICH BELONG TOGETHER HOW CAN I PREVENT WRITING KIND OF THE SAME CODE MORE THAN ONCE EVEN IF IT'S JUST THREE LINES

FOR LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK I LEARNED MOST OF IT WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THINGS WHICH PUT ME AT THE LIMIT OF THE HARDWARE AT THAT TIME TRY TO MAKE SURE YOUR PROGRAMS DON'T USE MORE THAN RAM OR LESS TRY TO IMPLEMENT A FILE SYSTEM YES THAT'S POSSIBLE AND EASIER THAN YOU THINK READ CODE LOTS OF CODE
HAVE A LOOK AT THONGY HETP AN IDE FOR BEGINNERS AND STUDENTS I THINK IT MIGHT FIT YOUR REQUIREMENTS
SOME GOOD AND WELL KNOWN IDES INCLUDE PYCHARM AND VS CODE THEY WILL MORE THAN LIKELY WIND UP USING THE COMMAND LINE AT SOME POINT EITHER TO RUN THEIR SCRIPTS OR TO MESS AROUND WITH THE PYTHON CONSOLE VS CODE IS GREAT FOR THIS SINCE IT INCLUDES AN INTEGRATED CONSOLE YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET SOME INPUT FROM SOMEONE WHO DOES USE PYCHARM SINCE I HAVEN'T USED IT BEFORE AND AM NOT SURE OF WHAT FEATURES IT HAS BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IT'S ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST PYTHON IDE AROUND
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WILL BE A VERY BASIC COURSE SO IT MAY BE SOMETHING LIKE PYTHON NOTEBOOK JUPITER WOULD BE SUITABLE
I AM USING SNYDER AND ALSO TAUGHT SOME LINEAR ALGEBRA WITH IT
PYCHARM COMMUNITY EDITION FREE ALL THE WAY IT'S PROBABLY NOT WHAT SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL LIGHTWEIGHT BUT FRANKLY UNLESS YOU ARE USING VERY OLD LAPTOPS THE ADVANTAGES IT HAS IN TERMS OF USER FRIENDLINESS FAR OUTWEIGH ANY CONCERNS ABOUT SPEED

THERE IS ALSO PYCHARM EDU WHICH IS A STRIPPED DOWN VERSION OF PYCHARM FOR TEACHING PERSONALLY I FIND THAT OUTSIDE A PYTHON COURSE IT'S A BIT TOO LIMITING WHICH CAN UNDERMINE PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GROW ON THE OTHER HAND IT COMES WITH TOOLS DESIGNED FOR CREATING LESSONS WHICH COULD BE VERY USEFUL FOR YOU
PYCHARM LICENSES ARE FREE FOR STUDENTS IT'S EXCELLENT
NOT SURE YOU CAN GET BOTH SUPER SIMPLE AND IDE IT JUST GENERALLY DOESN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY SADLY

IF YOU WANT A SIMPLE SETUP NOTEPAD WITH THE PYNPP PUGIN IS ENOUGH BUT YOU WON'T GET CODE INSPECTION DEBUGGING AND SUCH LIKE YOU WOULD WITH A FULL FLEDGED IDE

PERSONALLY I USE PYCHARM IT HAS ADVANCED FEATURES BUT THEY AREN'T SHOVED INTO YOUR FACE AND CAN BE IGNORED THE INTERFACE IS ALSO RELATIVELY SIMPLE BY DEFAULT YOU HAVE A SIDEBAR TO DISPLAY YOUR PROJECT FILE TREE AND A CODEVIEW WITH TABS THAT IS IT YOU CAN QUICKLY RUN CODE MANY WAYS WITH THE EASY TO ACCESS PYTHON CONSOLE FROM A TAB AT THE BOTTOM THE TERMINAL CMD SIMILARLY FROM A TAB AT THE BOTTOM OR WITH THE INCREDIBLY OBVIOUS GREEN RUN BUTTON YOU CAN ALSO JUST A CODEVIEW TAB OR FILE AND RUN IT FROM THERE
I WOULD RECOMMEND THONGY EDITOR ITS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND SHOULD BE GOOD FOR TEACHING I PERSONALLY USE IT WHEN WRITING SMALL SCRIPTS
NINJA IS PROBABLY WORTH LOOKING INTO IT WAS MY FIRST IDE BEFORE I MOVED TO PYCHARM AND I REMEMBER IT BEING PRETTY SIMPLE TO USE

LINK HETP
PERSONALLY I AM A PYCHARM USER HOWEVER FOR QUICK PYTHON EDITING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND OR KOMODO EDIT BOTH HAVE FREEWARE LITE EDITIONS

CIRC KOMODO HAS A PORTABLE EDITION WHICH NEED NOT BE INSTALLED JUST UNZIP AND RUN WING IDE MAY REQUIRE ADMIN PRIVILEGES TO INSTALL

OP HERE
THANKS EVERYONE SOME GREAT ADVICE AND LINKS TO FOLLOW UP HERE
AT FIRST GLANCE THONGY LOOKS MOST PROMISING BUT I WILL BE SURE TO CHECK EACH SUGGESTION OUT
THANKS AGAIN
COIN PYTHONEDITORS
THE POWER OF THE SEARCH ENGINE



THOUGH PERHAPS YOU WERE JUST SPURRING CONVERSATION IN WHICH CASE I HAVE NEVER USED ANY OF THESE
THE TASK YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS CODE GENERATION IN GENERAL IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY POWERFUL THING BUT IF ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO DO IS FILL VALUES INTO A TEMPLATE AND MAYBE A BIT THEN IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER STRING MANIPULATION WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU TRYING TO DO
YOU WANT A TEMPLATING LANGUAGE THAT CAN TEMPLATE JAVASCRIPT MOST WEB TEMPLATING LANGUAGES WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT

YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AUTOMATICALLY CONVERT PYTHON CODE TO JAVASCRIPT
THE PYTHON LIBRARY BOKE CREATES JAVASCRIPT CODE FROM EITHER STRINGS OR FROM PYTHON FUNCTIONS MAYBE CHECK HOW THEY DO IT
NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR BUT BRYTHON IS A PYTHON TRANSPILER WRITTEN IN JAVASCRIPT IT CONVERTS PYTHON CODE AND EXECUTES IT
FIRST IT LOOKS LIKE THE SIGNAL YOU'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE PITCH OF IS ONLY SAMPLES LONG AT THIS IS ONLY SECONDS HOW ACCURATELY COULD YOU IDENTIFY A PITCH IF IT WAS PLAYING FOR SUCH A SHORT TIME

SECOND I IMAGINE YOUR FUNCTION ADF IS GONNA BE REALLY SLOW PARTICULARLY IF YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES BEYOND BECAUSE IT IS QUADRATIC COMPLEXITY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT FAST FOURIER TRANSFORMS IF YOU WANT TO DO REAL TIME AUDIO
FOR THE FIRST PROBLEM MAYBE DONT TRY TO GET THE NOTE PLAYED BASED ON ABSOLUTE FREQUENCY BUT RATHER ON THE RELATIVE PITCH COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS NOTE LET'S SAY THE VIOLIN IS OUT OF TUNE BY A WHOLE NOTE IF ALL THE STRING ARE OFF BY THE SAME AMOUNT THEN PLAYING THE NOTES WILL SOUND RIGHT IF THE FINGERING IS A BIT FLAT OR SHARP AS LONG AS THE RELATIVE PITCH BETWEEN FINGERS IS CLOSE YOU COULD COUNT IT AS THE RIGHT NOTE
WHAT YOU'VE MENTIONED HAVING ONE SCRIPT THAT DOES ALL THE API COMMUNICATION AND ACTING AS AN INTERMEDIARY FORWARDING THINGS BACK AND FORTH IS A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT YOU COULD USE A MESSAGE BROKER LIKE RABBITMQ OR SOMETHING SIMPLER IN SOME WAYS ANYHOW LIKE CEDIS THIS WAY WILL GIVE YOU THE MOST POWER AND FLEXIBILITY BUT IT'S POSSIBLY A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK TO PREFACTOR YOUR APPLICATIONS MOVING FROM A SYNCHRONOUS FLOW TO ASYNCHRONOUS CAN BE A BIT OF WORK IN REFRACTURING AND TESTING

A MUCH SIMPLER THOUGH LESS FLEXIBLE OPTION WOULD BE TO USE SOME SORT OF SYNCHRONISATION EAST G A FILE LOCK LIKE THOSE PROVIDED BY THE FASTENERS LIBRARY OR ONE OF THE MULTIPROCESSING PRIMITIVES MAKE EACH OF YOUR SCRIPTS ACQUIRE THE LOCK AND SLEEP A SECOND BEFORE DOING AN API CALL AND YOU'RE GUARANTEED TO NOT BE MAKING MORE THAN ONE CALL PER SECOND
I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW THE WAY YOU'RE DOING THIS BUT SOME TYPE OF MUREX OR LOCK COULD WORK YOU'D STILL HAVE TO CALL THE SAME FUNCTION ARE YOU SAYING THE API CALLS ARE DUPLICATED THROUGH THE DIFFERENT SCRIPTS OR THAT SEVERAL SCRIPTS CALL THE SAME MODULE WITH THE API CALLS

YOU MIGHT GET MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON
USING A LIB THAT ISN'T WRITTEN WITH ASYNC WILL BE PRETTY COMMON FOR AT LEAST YEARS I'D THINK
I FIND THREADS TO BE EASY TO WORK WITH AND THINK ABOUT I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THEM
I'VE BEEN TYING TO FIND A GOOD PRIMER ON ASYNC AWAIT BUT IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF DOING HETP REQUESTS IS AKIN TO THE ANIMAL DOG CAT EXAMPLE OF OOP IT'S UBIQUITOUS BORING AND NOT THAT GREAT AT REPRESENTING THE CONCEPT

I FEEL LIKE IF SOMEONE POINTED ME AT A SOLUTION OF A DIFFERENT PROBLEM I WOULD UNDERSTAND IT MUCH BETTER

IN FACT THIS TIES INTO THE QUESTION CAN A MULTIPROCESSING THREADING SOLUTION BE REPLACED BY ASYNC AWAIT HERE

IMAGINE I HAD INPUT FILES AND NEEDED TO APPLY A FUNCTION TO EACH OF THEM LINE BY LINE THE FUNCTION IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE SHOWER THAN I O SO I WANT TO READ AND STORE THE RESULTS IN PARALLEL

WITH JOBLIB I WOULD JUST MAP IT ONTO THE LIST OF FILES

WITH ASYNC AWAIT I STILL HAVE NO IDEA
EVERY TIME PYTHON CALLS INTO A C FUNCTION THAT IS PROPERLY WRITTEN TO RELEASE THE GIL OTHER PYTHON CODE AND OTHER C CODE CAN RUN

NUMERICAL CODE WRITTEN WITH BUMPY WILL BENEFIT FROM MULTITHREADING AND WILL BE TRULY CONCURRENT BECAUSE MOST BUMPY FUNCTIONS RELEASE THE GIL

THREADING IN PYTHON ISN'T NEARLY AS USELESS AS EVERYONE THINKS IT IS AND MULTIPROCESSING NOT THE ANSWER NEARLY AS OFTEN EITHER ACTUAL CONCURRENCY WITH THREADING TOTALLY HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING AND YET YOU HAVE PEOPLE TRYING TO SHUNT THEIR ARRAYS OVER TO A SEPARATE PROCESS TO DO TO FOURIER TRANSFORM AND SEND IT BACK AGAIN WHEN THAT WOULD HAVE RUN CONCURRENTLY IN THE SAME PROCESS JUST FINE
YES COROUTINES ARE NOT ALWAYS SUPERIOR TO THREADS SOMETIMES THEY ARE EASIER TO USE IT IS GOOD TO HAVE THE CHOICE
NOW THAT PYTHON HAS ADDED COROUTINES EAST G ASYNC AWAIT AS AN ALTERNATIVE
METHOD FOR CONCURRENCY DO YOU STILL SEE YOURSELF USING THREADING FOR
I WORK

I UNDERSTAND THREADING AS OPPOSED TO WHATEVER THE HECK ALIEN TECHNOLOGY ASYNC AWAIT IS
SO WITH ASYNC YOU CAN THEORETICALLY DO MANY HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF CONNECTIONS HOW MANY THREADS IN A THREADPOOL CAN I REASONABLY HAVE
BASICALLY IF YOU'RE NOT DOING NETWORKING CODE THEN YES YOU WILL NEED THREADS YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THREADS WITH ASYNC AWAIT WHICH IS AORTA NICE
HONESTLY I FEEL LIKE ASYNCIO WAS A HORRIBLE NAME ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING KINDA I MEAN THERE'S A CATCH TO IT I O OPERATIONS I GUESS YOU COULD BUT THE ONLY THING ASYNCIO REALLY SOLVES IS THE PROBLEM OF WAITING FOR A FILE HOWEVER IT CAN'T ACTUALLY REPLACE THREADING MULTIPROCESSING LIBRARIES BECAUSE ASYNC LIBRARY USES COOPERATIVE SCHEDULING THAT MEANS THAT YOUR FUNCTION ONCE STARTED RESUMED HAS A MONOPOLY ON THE THREAD UNTIL YOU RELEASE CONTROL IN A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE THIS MEANS THAT WITH ASYNCIO IN ORDER FOR A HEARTBEAT TO WORK YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT ALL CODE PATHS WILL HIT AN AWAIT EVERY HEARTBEAT INTERVAL OTHERWISE YOUR HEARTBEAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN BY COMPARISON EVEN WITH THE GIL A MULTITHREADED HEARTBEAT IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE CALLED AS SOON AS THE HEARTBEAT INTERVAL HAS PASSED AND THE CURRENT ATOMIC OPERATION PROBABLY ABOUT A LINE OF CODE FINISHES
TL R ASYNCIO IS CONCURRENT NOT PARALLEL
PYTHON HAS HAD ACTUAL MULTI CORE PROCESSING FOR A WHILE IT JUST LAUNCHES MULTIPLE PYTHON INSTANCES HOWEVER
UNLIKELY HONESTLY I RARELY DO ANYTHING IN PYTHON WHERE THE GIL PRESENTS AN ACTUAL PRACTICAL PROBLEM AND IF I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING AND NEEDED GREAT PARALLELISM SUPPORT WHERE PERFORMANCE WAS AN ISSUE I WOULDN'T USE PYTHON AT ALL I'D USE CLOSURE OR GO OR JAVA OR HELL ERLANG
YES I DO STILL USE THREADS FOR SOME REASONS

I'M VERY USED TO THREADS I'M AWARE OF THE DANGER AND I KNOW HOW TO BE SAFE

ASYNC AWAIT REQUIRES A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO CODE STRUCTURE WHENEVER I FEEL THAT THE STYLE IS MORE SUITED TO MY NEEDS AND THERE ARE NO OTHER REASONS TO AVOID THREADS I USE THREADS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE DAVID CURIO LIBRARY REACHING A PRODUCTION LEVEL QUALITY IN ORDER TO USE ASYNC WITH SEMANTIC I THINK APPROACH TO ASYNC PROGRAMMING IS BETTER THAN THE OFFICIAL ONE

SOMETIMES I REWRITE PERFORMANCE CRITICAL CODE IN A C SHARED LIBRARY LOADED THROUGH COTYPES AND THIS LETS ME SKIP GIL LIMITATIONS WITH THREADS AND OBTAIN TRUE CPU PARALLELISM

JUST MY
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE BASICALLY THE ENTIRE SCIENTIFIC PYTHON STACK WILL CONTINUE TO RELY HEAVILY ON THREADS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE HUGE CHUNKS OF THAT STACK DO RELEASE THE GIL SO THREADS DO OPERATE IN PARALLEL THE COMMON EXAMPLE IS BUMPY ITSELF BUT THERE'S TON'S OF STUFF BOTH FOR DOING CPU INTENSIVE WORK LIKE MACHINE LEARNING WITH AND DOING I O ON LARGE DATA FILES EAST G GBS OF WEATHER DATA IN NETCDF FILES

IN GENERAL THIS NEEDS REPEATING A LOT MORE A DATA SCIENCE APPLICATIONS IS REALLY HUGE PART OF THE PYTHON COMMUNITY WE DON'T CARE MOSTLY ABOUT WEBSERVERS ASYNC OR OTHERWISE WE GET PERFORMANCE BY WRITING CRITICAL ELEMENTS IN COTHON C FORTRAN AND HOPEFULLY RUST IN THE NEAR FUTURE THE GIL IS NOT A BIG DEAL BECAUSE NATIVE EXTENSIONS RELEASE IT

THAT SAID MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE WRITING THREADS DIRECTLY BUT USING A SCHEDULAR TASK QUEUE TO DO IT FORM THEM SUCH AS ASK OR JOBLIB



FUCK YES PREEMPTIVE MULTITASKING
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THREADS AND ASYNC HOW DOES ASYNC WORK UNDER THE HOOD
OF COURSE EVERYONE KNOWS MOST REAL WORK IS DONE ON
MOST AREN'T THAT ODD BUT THE ONES THAT ARE ARE PRETTY BAD

THE LOOP ODDITY IS REALLY USEFUL IN MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENTS A B 2 YOU DON'T WANT TO FACE AN ARBITRARY RESTRICTION LIKE B HAS TO BE A NAME BECAUSE THEN YOU COULDN'T DO THINGS LIKE SELF X SELF Y

PYTHON ADDITION ODDITY YES ALL THAT LIST NEEDS FOR THE RHS IS AN ITERABLE

PYTHON HASHING ODDITY YES FUNCTIONS ARE IMMUTABLE

PYTHON ARRAY ODDITY EVALUATION IS LEFT TO RIGHT THE ONLY QUESTION YOU MIGHT HAVE IS IF IT EVALUATES THE ENTIRE RHS BEFORE ASSIGNING TO THE LHS OR IF IT WEAVES IT AND REALLY WHO CARES ANYONE WHO USES MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENT WITH THE SAME OBJECT ON THE LHS AND RHS DESERVES THE BUGS THEY INTRODUCE FOR IT



THE ISNUMERIC ODDITY YEAH SOMEBODY SHOULD GET SHOT FOR THAT ONE EITHER FIX THE ISNUMERIC FUNCTION OR REMOVE IT FROM THE STRING CLASS RIGHT NOW IT IS MORE CONFUSING THAN USEFUL

PYTHON ODDITY THIS IS JUST DUMB IMMUTABLE BASE TYPES SHOULD COMPARE USE FOR IS IF SOMEONE ACTUALLY NEEDS TO KNOW IF AN IMMUTABLE BASE OBJECT IS DUPLICATED IN MEMORY PROVIDE SOME OTHER WAY TO DO IT EITHER THAT OR DON'T CALL IT IS IS HAS SEMANTIC MEANING AND IS NOT JUST AN IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL

PYTHON SYNTAX ODDITY OBVIOUSLY A BUG IN THE PARSER PRESUMABLY UNFIXABLE BUT HOW USEFUL ARE DRAWSTRINGS

HAHA AGREE TO YOUR POINTS
I CAN'T FIND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PYTHON BOOLEAN ODDITY AND ONE MORE PYTHON BOOLEAN ODDITY

WAS THE SECOND ONE SUPPOSED TO BE WITH FALSE INSTEAD OF TRUE
PICKLING IS AWESOME IF YOU DON'T NEED EXTREME PERFORMANCE OR ANY GUARANTEE OF SECURITY AS LONG AS YOUR PICKLED OBJECTS NEVER FLY OVER THE INTERNET IN AN AUTOMATED WAY YOU'RE GOLDEN
I NEVER USE PICKLES FOR PERSISTENT OBJECTS THEY'RE JUST NOT ROBUST IN THE FACE OF ONGOING CHANGES TO THE CLASSES OF THE PICKLED OBJECTS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH OBJECTS ARE PICKLED THEIR CLASSES ARE NOT

MUCH BETTER TO USE A PERSISTENT FORMAT THAT IS UNDER YOUR CONTROL AND WHICH CAN EVOLVE INDEPENDENTLY OF YOUR CLASS DEFINITIONS IF NEED BE

I DO USE PICKLES FOR SERIALISATION OF OBJECTS WHERE THE SERIALISED REPRESENTATIONS ARE TRANSIENT AND NEVER PERSISTED EAST G SENDING OBJECTS TO A SUBPROCESS IN FACT THIS IS HOW MULTIPROCESSING WORKS
USING PICKLE IS NOT WRONG OF THE TIME BUT THERE ARE VERY VERY VERY FEW TIMES WHERE IT'S THE BEST CHOICE

PICKLE WILL BREAK IF YOUR CODE CHANGES PYTHON MODULE CLASS ATTRIBUTE NAMES INTO THE PICKLED VALUE SO IF YOU RENAME A CLASS OR MOVE THINGS AROUND IN BASICALLY ANY WAY YOUR PICKLED VALUES WILL BE UNRECOVERABLE
PICKLE WORKS ROUGHLY SPEAKING BY DUMPING THE AST BYTECODE FOR A GIVEN VALUE THIS MEANS THAT PICKLED VALUES ARE CODE THAT IS EXECUTED ALL CONSIDERATIONS THAT APPLY TO ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION APPLY TO PICKLED DATA IF YOU ALLOW AN END USER TO SUPPLY PICKLED VALUES YOUR SYSTEM IS INHERENTLY VULNERABLE TO CODE EXECUTION
EVEN IF THE SOURCE CODE HASN'T CHANGED PICKLED VALUES MAY OR MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE BETWEEN EVEN MINOR PYTHON VERSION UPDATES

THESE DETAILS MEAN THAT PICKLE IS NOT A GOOD OPTION FOR LONG TERM STORAGE OF VALUES NOR IS IT GOOD FOR TRANSMISSION OF DATA IT IS NOT DURABLE IT IS NOT SECURE

YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE CODE DOESN'T CLARIFY MUCH ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY STORING OR WHAT THE CODE DOES OVERALL IT AORTA SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO STORE CONFIGURATION VALUES IF THAT'S THE CASE YOU VERY LIKELY COULD USE JASON JASON ALLOWS YOU TO STORE SEVERAL VERY USEFUL AND FUNDAMENTAL DATA TYPES STRINGS INTEGERS BOOLEANS MAPS DCTS AND SEQUENCES LISTS I'M FIRMLY OF THE OPINION THAT IF YOU CAN'T DISTILL YOUR INFORMATION DOWN TO THESE DATA TYPES YOUR DATA IS POORLY STRUCTURED OR OVERLY COMPLEX

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THIS DATA THAT'S BEING STORED A DATABASE MAY ALSO BE USEFUL YOU MENTION HAVING MULTIPLE VALUES RECORDS THAT YOU'RE UPDATING AND THEN RELOADING PERIODICALLY YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER USING SOMETHING LIKE SALITE TO PROVIDE A PERSISTENT DATA STORE FOR THESE DATA WHICH PROVIDES A WHOLE REALM OF GUARANTEES AND FEATURES BEST DESCRIBED HERE

MORE CONCRETE DETAILS AND A COPY OF THE CODE ARE NECESSARY BEFORE ANY MORE CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE MADE
IF IT'S PURE DATA IT'S FINE BUT IF YOUR DATA STRUCTURE HAS OBJECTS OR YOUR DATA STRUCTURE EVER CHANGES OR YOUR PICKLED FILE SHOULD WORK ACROSS PYTHON VERSIONS JUST DON'T
PIP ALLOWS YOU TO INSTALL DEVELOPMENT EDITABLE VERSIONS OF YOUR LIBRARY WHICH IS A DIRECT LINK TO YOUR LIVE IN DEVELOPMENT CODE SO YOU WONT HAVE TO BUILD UPLOAD DOWNLOAD INSTALL DURING YOUR DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
WHY NOT JUST KEEP ITEM AS SEPARATE GIT REPOS AND ADD THEM TO YOUR PYTHONPATH

EXPORT PYTHONPATH HOME GIT PROJECT HOME GIT PROJECT

ADD IT TO YOUR BASHARA SO IT WILL BE SET EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH A TERMINAL

YOU CAN DEVELOP ON EVERY PROJECT AND ONCE YOU HAVE STABLE VERSIONS YOU CAN

BUILD PACKAGES

EDIT

SORRY I JUST REALISED I JUST ASSUMED YOU ARE USING LINUX
ARE YOU USING LINUX
A WAY TO SEPARATE THEM INTO THEIR OWN REPOS

I KNOW THIS WILL SOUND FACETIOUS BUT HAVE YOU TRIED MAKING NEW REPOS AND COPYING YOUR CODE THERE THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID YOU WANT TO DO SO DO THAT

AS FAR AS INSTALLING JUST CLONE THE REPOS INTO FOLDER AND THEN YOU CAN PUSH AND PULL CHANGES DIRECTLY
AT FIRST GLANCE THIS LOOKS LIKE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF NIH WHY

THE SCOPE IS WHY
SEPARATE THE TWO CASES IF THE LENGTH OF THE LIST IS ODD THEN YOU WANT THE ELEMENT AT THE FIRST INTEGER INDEX ABOVE THE HALFWAY POINT USING FLOOR DIVISION OPERATOR THAT WILL BE LEN HYLIST 2 YOU SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO ADJUST THAT CODE SLIGHTLY FOR THE EVEN LENGTH CASE BUT REMEMBER YOU WANT TO GET TWO ELEMENTS THERE AND FIND THEIR AVERAGE
R LEARNPYTHON

FIRST YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THE LISTS ARE SORTED
MEDIAN IS AT INDEX 2 BECAUSE THE LIST IS OF ODD LENGTH AND THE MEDIAN LANDS SQUARELY ON THAT ELEMENT TAKE LENGTH OF THE LIST IT BY 2 TO GET INDEX 2 BAM
LENGTH IS EVEN SO MEDIAN IS NUMBERS 2 AND AVERAGED OUT USING THE RUN OF THE MILL MEAN X Y 2 TO GET THE NUMBERS REQUIRED YOU NEED INDICES AND 2 WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED WITH LEN LEN 2


IF THIS IS HOMEWORK WHERE THE GOAL IS TO LEARN TO ROLL YOUR OWN THEN BY ALL MEANS DO SO

OTHERWISE THE STANDARD LIBRARY HAS YOU COVERED
S JOIN NUMBER NUMBER 2 NUMBER NUMBER

YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS SUBREDDIT TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK
HOW ABOUT THIS

FIRST LET'S USE WITH WHEN OPENING THE FILE WHEN THE STATEMENTS IN THE WITH BLOCK ARE FINISHED EXECUTING THE FILE WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CLOSED EVEN IF AN EXCEPTION IS ENCOUNTERED THE FILE WILL STILL BE CLOSED MAKING IT A GOOD SAFE PRACTICE

LET'S ALSO GET RID OF THE FOR LOOP WE CAN USE A LIST COMPREHENSION TO MAKE A LIST OF THE RANDOM NUMBERS ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH LIST COMPREHENSIONS

FINALLY WE'LL USE THE PRINT FUNCTION RATHER THEN THE WRITE METHOD OF THE FILE TO WRITE THE OUTPUT WHY WE CAN USE ARGUMENT UNPACKING TO UNPACK THE NUMBERS IN THE LIST AS IF THEY WERE SEPARATE PARAMETERS FOR INSTANCE IF WE HAD A LIST OF THREE NUMBERS SUCH AS

X 2

AND WE CALLED

X

THIS WOULD BE THE SAME AS CALLING

2



WE'LL ALSO USE THE OPTIONAL SEP PARAMETER OF THE PRINT FUNCTION WHICH ISN'T AVAILABLE WITH THE WRITE FILE METHOD UNFORTUNATELY THIS PARAMETER SETS THE SEPARATOR TO USE BETWEEN MULTIPLE PARAMETERS FOR INSTANCE

PRINT 2 SEP

WOULD PRINT

WITHOUT THE QUOTES

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER IF OUR NUMBERS ARE IN BUMS WE CAN DO THIS

PRINT BUMS SEP

AND GET THE LIST OF NUMBERS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

IMPORT RANDOM

DEF MAIN
A FILE NAMED
WITH OPEN W AS OUTFIRE

FOR AMOUNT OF RANDOM NUMBERS
INT INPUT HOW MANY NUMBERS WOULD YOU LIKE TO GENERATE
MAKE A LIST OF NUMBERS
BUMS FOR NUM IN RANGE

WE'LL USE ARGUMENT UNPACKING AND THE SEP PARAMETER
PRINT BUMS FILE OUTFIRE SEP

YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON I SUGGEST LOOKING AT THE DOCS FOR STRING FORMATTING
I'VE WORKED IN FINANCIAL MODELLING A LOT THE BEST TOOL FOR THE KIND OF THING YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS EXCEL IT CAN RUN FORECASTS AND MONTE CARLO ETC AND IF YOU ARE USING THE MODEL TO SUPPORT A BUSINESS CASE THEN YOU NEED TO SHARE IT EASILY AND TRANSPARENTLY
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'D WANT TO DESIGN THREE FUNCTIONS ONE WHICH COMPUTES YOUR OUTPUT CALC BASED ON SEVERAL INPUTS FROM THERE WRITE A FOURTH SCRIPT WHICH PRODUCES YOUR AVERAGE CALCULUS FINALLY WRITE A SCRIPT TO ITERATE A THOUSAND TIMES RUNNING THE CALAS AND PRINTING OUTPUTS TO A LOG FILE INTO EXCEL FOR SHARING ANALYSIS
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON BUT EVEN THERE IS QUESTIONABLE SINCE THIS SOUNDS LIKE HOMEWORK
HAS AN EMAIL WALL
GO THOUGH EACH MISSING MODULE AND ASK IF YOU NEED IT IF YOU DON'T THEN YOU'RE FINE EAST G YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED BAYSIDE FOR A PAYT APP

DON'T

FROM IMPORT

THAT'S SO NOT GOING TO HELP PYINSTALLER

ALSO YOU'RE RUNNING PYINSTALLER AND TRYING TO JUMP TO THE END EAST G OVERFILE WHEN AT THE VERY LEAST YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT EVEN WORKS WITH MULTIPLE FILES YOU GOTTA DO A BUILDUP RUN WITH HEAVY DEBUG READ EVERYTHING AND TREAT WARNINGS AS ERRORS IN YOUR MAIN PROGRAM DO A MASS IMPORT OF ANY MISSING MODULES YOU CAN CLEAN IT UP LATER BUT GET SOMETHING WORKING

THEN THERE'S ISSUE OF SETUPTOOLS USE VERSION WHICH ISN'T WELL PUBLICIZED BUT MAYBE IT JUST WORKS FOR EVERYONE BUT ME

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND USING A SPEC FILE THAT WAY ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TYPE PYINSTALLER SPEC THEN YOU CAN HANDLE ALL YOUR MISSING ALLS ICONS AS WELL WHICH WHO EVEN KNOW HOW THAT'S HANDLED WITHOUT MAKING A SPEC FILE

HERE'S MY SPEC FILE

HOW DO YOU REPORT A BUG ON CORE PYTHON


DOWNVOTE ME IF YOU LIKE BUT

AFTER YEARS PYTHON FINALLY MAYBE GETS CLOSE TO THE SPEED OF PYTHON 2 IN ARBITRARY FILE HANDLING WHICH MOST OF MY CODE RELIES ON

MAYBE IN THE NEXT YEAR I'LL GIVE IT A TRY

BETTER SEPARATE THE AUDIO DECODING AND THE PLAYBACK THESE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS

THAT SAID FOR PLAYBACK I'M USING PYAUDIO FOR DECODING I'M RUNNING FFMPEG IN A SUBPROCESS THAT DECODES WHATEVER AUDIO FILE YOU THROW AT IT TO A PCM STEREO STREAM WHICH IS FED TO PYAUDIO
ANY REASON YOU DON'T WANT TO USE AN EXTERNAL EXECUTABLE TO DO THE HEAVYLIFTING BECAUSE I THINK IT'S NOT MUCH WORK TO ADD TIME SEEK SUPPORT TO MY WRAPPER CLASS
IT'S GOOD TO LEARN C BECAUSE IT'S WHAT THE MOST POPULAR PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION IS IMPLEMENTED IN LEARNING A LOW-LEVEL LANGUAGE LIKE C WILL ALLOW YOU TO UNDERSTAND BETTER WHY PYTHON BEHAVES THE WAY IT BEHAVES AND THEN HOW TO FULLY EXPLOIT ITS FEATURES FOR EXAMPLE WHY PYTHON LISTS ALLOCATE MORE MEMORY THAN THEY ACTUALLY NEED OR WHAT DROVE PYTHON TO USE GLOBAL INTERPRETER LOCK
INSTEAD OF JUST ONE LANGUAGE LET ME RECOMMEND THE BOOK SEVEN LANGUAGES IN SEVEN WEEKS BY BRUCE TATE

IT CAREFULLY PICKS SEVEN LANGUAGES EACH BASED ON A DIFFERENT UNDERLYING PARADIGM IT THEN PRESENTS EACH IN SEVEN INSTALLMENTS EACH OF WHICH CAN EASILY BE ABSORBED IN A DAY

IT S A GREAT WAY TO BROADEN YOUR HORIZONS WITHOUT COMMITTING TOO MUCH AT THIS POINT
HASKELL OR SCALA WILL EXPAND YOUR MIND GO FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS A REAL TYPE SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL IDIOMS AND AND PATTERN MATCHING
IN MY OPINION IT'S BEST TO GO AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE

A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF PYTHON IS A PRETTY GOOD STARTING POINT
FOLLOWING THAT WITH SOME ABSTRACT CS FROM ICP IN SCHEMA
THEN GO LOW LEVEL AND WORK THROUGH THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
THEN I'D PROBABLY GO ABOUT LEARNING SQL I DON'T HAVE A GOOD RESOURCE BUT I'D DEFINITELY RECOMMEND POSTGRESQL OVER OTHER DIALECTS

AT THAT POINT YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY SOLID FOUNDATION TO BUILD ON AND THEN IT'S A MATTER OF EXPLORING SPECIFIC TOPICS TYPE SYSTEMS HASKELL OR RUST OOP SMALLTALK ENTERPRISE JAVA OR C
RUST IS NOW PYTHON BEST FRIEND

YOU CAN CALL PYTHON FROM RUST AND VICE VERSA

RUST IS AS LOW LEVEL AS C BUT MUCH MORE MODERN ROBUST AND CAN STILL USE C LIBS

BOTTOM LINE

YOU WANT A HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE YOU GO PYTHON
YOU WANT A LOW LEVEL LANGAUGE YOU GO RUST

YOU USUALLY CAN START FRITTING A PROGRAM IN PYTHON AND REIMPLEMENT THE CRITICAL PART IN RUST LATER AS WE USED TO DO IN COUNTY

NO NEED FOR AN INTERMEDIARY LANGUAGES LIKE GO THAT ARE NOT EXACTLY LOW LEVEL OR HIGH LEVEL PYTHON RUST ALLOW YOU TO EXACTLY TARGET WHAT YOU NEED WITH THE EXACT FLEXIBILTY AND FIREPOWER REQUIRED
I LIKE HASKELL IT FITS IN THE CATEGORY SOMETHING REALLY DIFFERENT IT'S WHERE THE LIST COMPREHENSION CAME FROM IT HAS STATIC TYPES WITHOUT HAVING TO DECLARE THEM INDENTATION MATTERS IT WILL TEACH YOU ABOUT FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING AND ABOUT STATIC TYPES BUT IN A PLEASANT WAY CAN'T GO WRONG TRYING HASKELL YOU ASKED FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT BE PREPARED TO BE FRUSTRATED

AS FOR THE SAME THING IN REGARDS OF WEB AND GENERAL PURPOSE JUST TRY A BIT OF NODES AND BE AMAZED WITH ASYNCHRONOUS CALLBACKS PROMISES I WOULDN'T STAY TOO LONG

YOU COULD ALSO TRY A FRONTED FRAMEWORK REACTS PERHAPS THOUGH I GUESS CS FROWNS UPON THAT SO I MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE THIS BACK

ALSO RUST IS UP AND COMING FOR A NICE LOW LEVEL C REPLACEMENT COMPETING WITH GO THIS WILL PROBABLY START A DISCUSSION

YOU COULD ALSO STAY IN PYTHON AND WORK WITH COTHON THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING AS WELL

JUST MY
LEARN YOUR PYTHON TO BE SOCIAL

PYTHON CAN TALK TO INTERPRETER TK R AND IT IS NICE LEARNING THE LANGUAGES BEFORE THE BINDINGS BECAUSE IT OPENS A DOOR TO A NEW WORLD YOU CAN DO WITH PYTHON LIKE

PYTHON CAN BIND ON C ASM FORTRAN LIBRARIES THUS LEARNING C EXTENSION FFI AND OTHERS TRICK IS NICE

THEN I WOULD PUT ON TOP EXPECT THAT IS REALLY A NICE TRICK OF ACL PORTED IN PYTHON WITH PREEXPECT BECAUSE YOU CAN DO AMAZING INTERACTIONS WITH ALMOST ANY INTERPRETERS AND DEVICES LIKE ROUTERS

WITH THIS YOU CAN EMBRACE THE REAL STRENGTH OF PYTHON HAVING THE ADVANTAGE OF ALMOST EVERY LANGUAGE POSSIBLE AND MORE
C REALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE INTRICACIES OF PROGRAMMING AND MAKES YOU APPRECIATE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED IN HIGHER LEVEL LANGUAGES
SINCE YOU KNOW PYTHON YOU COULD ENJOY OTHER PARADIGMS WITH ALSO PYTHON LIBRARIES THERE ARE A FEW PYTHON VARIANTS

DG IS VERY FUNCTIONAL A BIT LIKE HASKELL IT DOESN'T HAVE TYPES NOR PATTERN MATCHING BUT IT'S USEFUL
HY IS A WEIRD LISP
COCONUT IT PYTHON COMPATIBLE AND MORE FUNCTIONAL

ALSO I WOULDN'T LEARN C BUT A HIGHER LEVEL LANGUAGE LIKE ELIXIR HETP WHICH IS SIMILAR TO RUBY BUT HAS MANY NEW CONCEPTS

YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY NEED TO KNOW JAVASCRIPT LATER OR SOONER BUT HERE AGAIN YOU HAVE PLENTY OF CHOICES A FUNCTIONAL AND TERSE VARIANT LIVESCRIPT AWESOME A VARIANT ETC
I'D PICK SWIFT MORE PRACTICALLY COUNTY AND FOR DIFFERENT A LISP OR HASKELL BUT DIFFERENT ISN'T NECESSARILY GOOD
CARVE A UNICODEDECODEERROR TO MAKE IT REALLY SPOOKY

THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED LOOKS AMAZING
TECHNICAL QUESTION HOW DID YOU GET THE TWO CIRCLES TO FLOAT THAT WAY
PEKIN
I APPRECIATE THIS
I GUESS IT'S COOL BUT SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS BUGGING ME

MAYBE IT'S THAT IT'S A LITTLE CRINGE I LIKE PYTHON BUT WHEN I GO TO A PARTY OR HANG OUT WITH MY WIFE AND KID I DON'T FLY THE GEEK FLAG SO HIGH IT'S NOT THAT I'M EMBARRASSED TO BE A NERD IT'S MORE THAT SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SMELLS OF DESPERATION LIKE YOU'RE BEGGING FOR PEOPLE TO ASK WHAT IT IS SO YOU CAN TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT AND THEY'LL BE IMPRESSED BY HOW TECHNICAL AND SMART YOU ARE

GEEKY WITH ESOTERIC JOKES MAKE ME FEEL THE SAME WAY THEY SEEM DESIGNED TO MAKE THE PERSON WEARING THEM FEEL SMUG AND SUPERIOR TO THOSE WHO AREN'T IN THE KNOW

THAT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU GET UNDER THE COMMUNITY EDITION THE PRO EDITION SHOULD JUST HANDLE COTHON AND SYNTAX HIGHLIGHT EVERYTHING PROPERLY OUT OF THE BOX CHECK YOUR VERSION

WHAT WEB FRAMEWORK DO YOU WANT TO USE DURANGO OR SOMETHING ELSE ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND YOU MIGHT GET CLOSER TO YOUR ANSWER OR AT LEAST NARROW YOUR SEARCH
DURANGO IS A WEB FRAMEWORK SO IT'S NOT SPECIALIZED WITH YOU HAVE 2 OPTIONS

USE ANY SOLUTION BUILT WITH DURANGO AND THEN USE READY MADE TEMPLATES FOR THAT SOLUTION
FIND ANY HEML CSS TEMPLATE FOLIO I AT AND JUST USE IT WITH YOUR HAND MADE SOLUTION

WHY WOULD YOU WANT THAT KIND OF VISUAL DISTRACTION YOUR IDE WILL BE ALREADY LOADED WITH SYNTAX HIGHLIGHT COLORS VISUAL CUES FOR CHANGES ERRORS COLUMNS AND CURSORS ETC WHY ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF VISUAL NOISE ON TOP OF THAT
I KNOW THE QT FRAMEWORK ALLOWS THIS AS AN OPTION FOR WINDOWS WIDGETS YOU CAN SET THE BACKGROUND COLOR AS R G B A WHERE SETTING THE ALPHA CHANNEL ALLOWS YOU TO TOGGLE THE LEVEL TRANSPARENCY

OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I'M NOT SURE IF THERE ARE ANY PYTHON BASED ON QT BUT IF THERE ARE THEN IN PRINCIPLE ITS POSSIBLE WHETHER OR NOT THE OPTION IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER IS ANOTHER STORY
MOST DESKTOP ENVIRONMENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET TRANSPARENCY FOR INDIVIDUAL WINDOWS THESE DAYS
IF YOU LIKE WORK WITH CONSOLE YOU CAN USE CONSOLE EDITOR FOLIO I VIM

WORTH IT JUST TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS
I'D SAY YOUR BEST BET IS TO OPTIMIZE BY WAY OF BUILDING A SPECIFIC APPLICATION WITH PROFILING IT AND THEN OPTIMIZING BASED ON WHAT THE PROFILING TELLS YOU GENERIC OPTIMIZATIONS LIKE RUNNING PIPY ARE USEFUL BUT THEY'RE GENERIC THEY DON'T SPEED UP WHAT SPECIFIC BOTTLENECKS MIGHT EXIST IN THE APPLICATION YOU'VE BUILT

ID
PROBABLY GOING TO GET DOWNVOTED FOR THIS SINCE IT IS R PYTHON AFTER ALL BUT WHY DON'T JUST START WITH SOMETHING LIKE GO THEN IF YOU REALLY NEED HIGH PERFORMANCE THAT BADLY AND ARE ALREADY USING LOW-LEVEL FRAMEWORKS LIKE ANYWAY RATHER THAN GOING FOR SUCH AN OBSCURE STACK USING THE AVM OR LLM

EDIT OR EVEN JUST PLAIN OLD PYTHON WITH ASYNCIO SHOULD GET PRETTY DECENT PERFORMANCE ALSO
DON'T THINK THAT LLM EXAMPLE IS FOR WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING TO USE IT FOR

THE TWO MAINSTREAM OPTIONS AT THIS POINT ARE ASYNCIO WITH UNLOOP OR PIPY OR USE ANOTHER FAST FRAMEWORK THAT IS BUILT TO BE FAST LIKE FALCON
THANK YOU FOR TIPS GUYS I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THE THINGS YOU SUGGESTED
FOR ASYNCIO I JUST WROTE AN ASYNCHRONOUS SERVER YESTERDAY YOU CAN DM IF YOU WANT THE LINK ITS NOT THOROUGHLY TESTED BUT YOU CAN WRITE YOUR OWN HANDLERS FOR IT LOOKED TO HANDLE ABOUT CONNECTIONS ON AN OLD DUAL CORE WORKSTATION

ALTHOUGH SAYS IT IS UP IT IS DOWN FOR ME
MY OPEN SOURCE LIBRARY HAS LOTS OF EXAMPLES BUT THE PEPI PACKAGE DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY OF THEM IF IT DID THEY'D BE BURIED INSIDE WHICH IS KINDA DUMB

THEN JUST LINK TO THE EXAMPLES ON YOUR GITHUB OR DO IT ONE BY ONE IT'S PRETTY STANDARD TO DO IT THAT WAY I'M EVEN LAZIER SO I JUST SAY DOWNLOAD CLONE THE ACTUAL GITHUB REPOSITORY IF YOU WANT EVERYTHING
WILL DO THE TRICK DOCS ARE DOWN BUT YOU CAN HELP
USE BUMPY
A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE ANACONDA AS A SELF CONTAINED PYTHON INSTALLATION IDE AND THE NOTEBOOKS ARE GREAT I AM NOT SURE YOU CAN RUN IT FROM A USB BUT I WOULD THINK YOU COULD

I THINK THE BEST OPTION MAY BE TO SET UP A SERVER SOMEWHERE LIKE YOUR HOUSE THAT YOU COULD TSH INTO THROUGH PUTTY YOU COULD USE AN OLD COMPUTER OR EVEN A RASPBERRY PI THEN YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT BECAUSE ITS YOUR MACHINE IT'S JUST LOCATED SOMEWHERE ELSE
IF THERE EVER WAS A REASON TO TAKE A DRILL TO A LAPTOP WEBCAM THIS WOULD BE IT

WHATEVER REMOTE SYSTEM YOU SET UP IT'LL STILL BE A HASSLE SUGGEST YOU TRY TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TOOL THAT YOU'LL BE LIKELY TO USE IN YOUR LATER ENDEAVORS

NOWADAYS BUILDING AND DEPLOYING A DURANGO STACK MEANS HAVING VIRTUALENV A LOCAL DB SERVER LIKE POSTURES A VIRTUAL CONTAINER SERVICE LIKE DOCKER VERSION CONTROL LIKE GIT AND A GOOD IDE EDITOR WITH DECENT EDITING REFRACTURING AND DEBUGGING CAPABILITIES YOU'LL ALSO NEED NETWORK ACCESS TO LOOK UP DOCS AND EXAMPLES AS WELL AS A DECENT HEML JAVASCRIPT EDITOR DEBUGGER IF YOU NEED TO HAVE A WEB OR A JASON VISUALIZER AND API TESTER IF USING DTF

TRYING TO DO THAT ALL REMOTELY WILL SLOW YOU DOWN AND MAKE THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE ANNOYING

IF THE OBJECTION TO BRINGING YOUR OWN LAPTOP IS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE WEBCAM I'D LOOK INTO DISABLING OR REMOVING THE CAMERA IF IT'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU MAY WANT TO CARRY AN SSD DRIVE WITH A BOOTABLE PARTITION AND BOOT YOUR WORK MACHINE TO WORK OFF THAT DRIVE
THERE ARE LAPTOPS WITHOUT WEBCAMS MY PARTNER HAS AN OLD THINKPAD WITHOUT ONE THINKPADS AT LEAST THROUGH THE ERA HAD A OPTION I SUSPECT MORE RECENT ONES DO AS WELL BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW I'D BET ALSO ANYTHING THAT MANY MACHINES FROM DELL AND HP ALSO HAVE OPTIONS

IF YOU TRAWL THROUGH EBAY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A THINKPAD OR WITHOUT A CAMERA FOR OR UNDER BOTH SHOULD RUN PYCHARM PERFECTLY WELL THE KEY IS THAT YOU'D NEED TO MAKE SURE THE INDIVIDUAL MACHINE IS WITHOUT A CAMERA MAYBE BY CONTACTING THE SELLER

THIS PAGE HAS A PICTURE OF A THINKPAD BEZEL WITH AND WITHOUT A CAMERA JUST SO YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF THE DIFFERENCE AND TO SEE IF THAT WOULD PASS MUSTER WITH YOUR WORDSPITE

GOOD LUCK
CAN'T YOU RUN PYCHARM OFF A USB STICK OTHER OPTIONS ARE VIM JEDI VISUAL STUDIO CODE SUBLIME WITH THE RIGHT PLUGGING
I CAN'T BRING IN MY PERSONAL LAPTOP BECAUSE IT HAS A BUILT-IN CAMERA

DRILL OUT THE CAMERA
IT IS DESIGNED TO RUN ON MUCH LARGER CRAWLS RATHER THAN SPEEDILY DOWNLOADING A SINGLE FILE

ISN'T THIS WHAT YOU'RE AFTER IT QUERIES THE GOOGLE TRANSLATE WEBSITE SO IS FREE
SINGLE WORDS IS A DICTIONARY SENTENCES IS SUPER COMPLEX AND REALLY HARD EVEN GOOGLE WHO IS A CLEAR WORLD LEADER IS SO-SO BETWEEN INDOEUROPEAN LANGUAGES AND BAD OUTSIDE THAT FAMILY

PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA TO RELY ON THIS TO LEARN A LANGUAGE THOUGH
CHECK OUT TRANSLATION SERVICE OF RUSSIAN IT COMPANY YANDER IT'S FREE AND IT SUPPORTS MANY LANGUAGES THOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THEIR DOCS ARE AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH

DEVELOPERS
I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT TRANSLATION SOLUTIONS AND GOOGLES TRANSLATE API IS UNQUESTIONABLY THE BEST I'VE FOUNDATION THE RATE LIMITS SHOULD BE MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR WHAT YOU DESCRIBE AND THE TRANSLATION QUALITY IS VERY HIGH

YOU CAN THEN USE NOLT ON THE RETURNED TRANSLATION TO RESTRUCTURE SENTENCES OR ADJUST TAGS AND SUCH NOLT IS GREAT

CHECK OUT ARGPARSE
THIS IS NICE BUT YOU MAY WISH TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS JUST AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A SIMPLE METHODOLOGY WITH A SAMPLING STRATEGY IMPORTANTLY IT COULD HAVE PROBLEMS ON MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROBLEMS FOR INSTANCE I TYPICALLY TEST MY NUMERICAL OPTIMIZATION AND MODEL EMULATION STRATEGIES USING THE ROSENBROCK FUNCTION THE ISHIGAMI FUNCTION AND A HOW WELL DOES YOUR ALGORITHM FAIR ON THESE AND HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO OTHER SURROGATE MODELING STRATEGIES POLYNOMIAL CHAOS EXPANSION LARS ETC

I'VE ALSO FOUND THE MULTIPROCESSING PACKAGE TO NOT REALLY BE THE BEST FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS BECAUSE ERROR HANDLING PARTICULARLY WHEN MODEL EVALUATIONS FAIL CAN BE KIND OF BRITTLE I'VE USED STRATEGIES IN THE PAST TO FARM OUT WORK TO A CLUSTER BUT THESE DAYS I'VE FOUND A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH JOBLIB YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK IT OUT
I'M ANOTHER ONE WHO DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT AND THAT WORRIES ME I GOT STARTED ON PYTHON BACK IN ABOUT PRECISELY BECAUSE IT WAS BOTH POWERFUL AND ACCESSIBLE AND I'VE NEVER HAD REASON TO DOUBT THAT ASSESSMENT I STILL USE IT DAILY FOR BACK-END DEVELOPMENT FOR SYSADMIN FOR MATHEMATICAL MODELLING AND OTHER TASKS

BUT EVERY TIME I TRY TO DO SOMETHING ASYNCHRONOUSLY I EXPERIENCE A HEAVY COGNITIVE LOAD AND I RARELY ACHIEVE WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IT DOES WORRY ME THAT ALTHOUGH I HAVE VERY LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH NODE THERE ARE THINGS I CAN DO WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS OF PLAYING WITH NODE THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IN PYTHON I'M SURE IT'S POSSIBLE I JUST HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET

I WROTE AN ASYNCHRONOUS CHAT SERVER IN NODE WITHIN HOURS OF PICKING IT UP YEARS AGO I STILL DON'T KNOW THE RIGHT WAY OF DOING THAT IN PYTHON AND I CERTAINLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW I WOULD DO THAT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF NAGING UWSGI

BUT I STICK WITH PYTHON BECAUSE OF HOW BEAUTIFULLY IT HANDLES SYNCHRONOUS TASKS I'D HATE TO HAVE TO DO SAY REPORT PRODUCTION OR ANALYSIS IN NODE WITHOUT HAVING TOOLS LIKE PANDAS AVAILABLE

I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR ASYNCIO BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT YET AND I CERTAINLY COULDN'T TEACH IT TO OTHER TEAM MEMBERS
ANYONE STAYING WITH EVENT IN ARE THERE ANY PROS IN ASYNCIO BESIDE THAT IT'S EXPLICIT
CHECK OUT CURIO IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO ASYNCIO THAT'S A LOT MORE INTUITIVE
I ALSO SPENT SOME TIME LEARNING ASYNCIO CASUALLY AND I ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND IT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE ASYNC PROGRAMMING IS HARD BY DEFAULT LOOK AT TWISTED PEOPLE HATE IT SO MUCH AND COMPLAIN ABOUT ITS COMPLEXITY ALL THE TIME PERHAPS ASYNCHRONOUS CODE IS JUST DIFFICULT TO REASON ABOUT AND DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE ALL THESE MENTAL MODELS COMING FROM COMMON SENSE DAILY LIFE REASONING THEY ARE ALL SYNCHRONOUS BY DEFAULT WHEN WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND OR DEVELOP ASYNCHRONOUS FRAMEWORKS WE GET ALL CONFUSED BECAUSE IT IS SO FOREIGN TO OUR DEFAULT STYLE OF THOUGHT
WITH ASYNCIO YOU NEED VERSIONS OF EVERY LIBRARY

WITH EVENT YOU JUST THE CORE LIBRARIES AND THE REST WORKS OUT OF THE BOX

IT'S NOT ASYNCIO THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT'S THE ECOSYSTEM THAT STILL NEEDS TO GROW A LOT FOR IT TO BE USEFUL FOR EVERY CASE IN WHICH I'D USE EVENT
IDEA IS TO BE A COMMON API SO THAT LIBRARIES CAN COMPETE REGARDING THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IF YOU DONT WANT TO WRITE AN ALTERNATIVE AND ONLY ARE A USER OF IT THEN THE SUBSET OF ASYNCIO THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS NOT THAT BIG IT ALSO ALLOWS A COMMON CONSTRUCTS FOR LIBRARIES AND DEVELOPERS TO EXPRESS ASYNCHRONOUS CODE IT WILL MAKE ASYNC LIBRARIES SMALLER AS WELL AS ALLOW THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR PRIMARY BENEFIT FOR THE ECOSYSTEM
CHECK OUT
ACTUALLY USING ASYNCIO TOOLS IS QUITE EASY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD HOWEVER FRITTING AN ASYNCIO LIB OR GOD SAVES YOU AN ASYNCIO FRAMEWORK IS REALLY REALLY HARD MOST ATTEMPT OUT THERE JUST IGNORE THE COMPLEXITY AND WORKS ONLY ON THE AUTHOR'S CONFIGURATION OF CHOICE
I'M A HEAVY PYTHON USER BUT HAVEN'T YET USED ASYNCIO I USED ASYNC AWAIT IN C A LITTLE BIT THOUGH AND ONE THING I KEEP WONDERING ABOUT IS HOW IT MEANS YOU HAVE TO HAVE DUPLICATE APIS FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF WE HAVE AN HETP LIBRARY BUT NOW WE NEED AN ASYNC ONE WE HAVE A DB LIBRARY BUT NOW WE NEED AN ASYNC VERSION WE HAVE SUBPROCESS BUT NOW WE NEED AN ASYNC VERSION OF THE API ETC WHEREAS IN GO THERE'S ONLY ONE SYNCHRONOUS VERSION OF THE API FOR EVERYTHING AND YOU GO DUNC TO RUN ANY EXISTING FUNCTION API ASYNC IN A COROUTINE

WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHAT'S THE TECHNICAL REASON IF ANY THAT PYTHON C ETC CAN'T TAKE THE GO APPROACH WHICH AVOIDS ALL THE DUPLICATE APIS
OH BOY ANOTHER ARTICLE WHERE I'VE OVERCOMPLICATED THIS TO THE POINT WHERE I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT

SO HERE IS THE CURRENT SET OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW EXIST
EVENT LOOP POLICIES

NO YOU DON'T THE ONLY TIME YOU EVER NEED TO KNOW THIS EXISTS IS WHEN YOU WANT TO SUBSTITUTE UNLOOP INTO YOUR APPLICATION

COROUTINE WRAPPERS

I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THESE BEFORE AND I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN THEM USED AT ALL

THE REST YOU MAY NEED A PASSING KNOWLEDGE OF BUT EVEN THEN YOU DON'T NEED AN KNOWLEDGE OF THEM TO USE ASYNCIO

ON THE SURFACE IT LOOKS LIKE EACH THREAD HAS ONE EVENT LOOP BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW IT WORKS

YES THAT IS HOW IT WORKS
GETS THE CURRENT EVENT LOOP THAT IS LOCAL TO THAT THREAD SETS THE CURRENT EVENT LOOP IN THAT THREAD COMING FROM THE FLASK AUTHOR THESE ARE JUST THREAD LOCAL VARIABLES

AS A COROUTINE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR DOES NOT KNOW WHICH EVENT LOOP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SCHEDULING IT

DON'T SCHEDULE COROUTINES FROM OTHER THREADS ON YOUR EVENT LOOP THIS IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER THERE'S EVEN A BUILT-IN FUNCTION FOR THIS ASYNCIO

NOW I AGREE THAT THE DESIGN IS VERY WEIRD ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO YIELD FROM WITH SOMETHINGS SUCH AS THE AIOHTTP CODE MIXING BOTH MEANINGS OF THEM HOWEVER CLEANS UP THE ACT OF THE CODE BY ENFORCING THAT YOU USE THE NEWER SYNTAX

ESSENTIALLY THESE ARE ALL OBJECTS WITH AN METHOD EXCEPT THAT THE GENERATORS DON'T FOR LEGACY REASONS

DON'T USE PYTHON COROUTINES

SO NOW THAT WE KNOW THERE ARE TWO INCOMPATIBLE FUTURES WE SHOULD CLARIFY WHAT FUTURES ARE IN ASYNCIO HONESTLY I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHERE THE DIFFERENCES ARE BUT I'M GOING TO CALL THIS EVENTUAL FOR THE MOMENT

ONE IS FROM ASYNCIO AND IS BOUND TO THE EVENT LOOP
THE OTHER IS FROM AND IS FOR USE IN CODE

ALTERNATIVELY YOU REQUIRE THAT THE LOOP IS BOUND TO THE THREAD

THIS IS THE SANE WAY TO DO IT WHY DO YOU HAVE MULTIPLE EVENT LOOPS RUNNING ONE THREAD HOW WOULD THAT EVEN WORK

LEARN TO RESTART THE EVENT LOOP FOR CLEANUP

NUMBER
GET ALL OF THE TASKS CURRENT RUNNING ON THIS LOOP LOOP LOOP
2 CANCEL THEM ALL
AWAIT THEM ALL TO ALLOW THE CANCEL TO BE HANDLED PROPERLY
ALL CLEANED UP

WORKING WITH SUBPROCESSES IS NON OBVIOUS

LIBRARY

WRITING CODE THAT SUPPORTS BOTH ASYNC AND SYNC IS SOMEWHAT OF A LOST CAUSE

THAT'S BECAUSE ASYNC AND SYNC ARE PRETTY INCOMPATIBLE WITH EACHOTHER ANYWAY

IF YOU WANT TO GIVE A COROUTINE A BETTER NAME TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT WAS NOT BEING AWAITED

WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS IF YOU HAVE A COROUTINE THAT DIES WITHOUT BEING AWAITED YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG
ASIDE FROM THE INSANE COMPLEXITY AND LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ON MY PART OF HOW TO BEST WRITE APIS FOR IT MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE COMPLETE LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR CONTEXT LOCAL DATA

WRITE YOUR OWN CONTEXTS THIS IS NOT ASYNCIO S JOB
MANY LIBRARIES PASS THROUGH A OBJECT TO EACH COROUTINE IN THE CHAIN WHO CAN THEN DO WITH IT AS THEY WANT

THE WORST PART IS THAT ASYNCIO IS NOT EVEN PARTICULARLY FAST

PYTHON ISN'T FAST HOW IS THIS A SURPRISE

THIS SEEMS LIKE A I'M UNWILLING TO LEARN HOW ASYNCIO WORKS POST MORE THAN A LEGITIMATE ARTICLE


IS THERE ANYTHING FROM PYTHON THAT THIS GUY LIKES HONEST QUESTION
I DON'T UNDERSTAND EITHER AND THE LACK OF DOCUMENTATION DOESN'T HELP AT ALL

CLASS A
DEF SELF A LOOP NONE
SELF A A
LOOP OR ASYNCIO

I'VE SEEN THIS CODE ON REPOS BUT I DON'T KNOW THE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS

ANOTHER THING IS

CLASS A
DEF SELF A
SELF A A
ASYNC DEF TEST SELF
AWAIT

CAN I JUST RUN LOOP OR DO I STILL NEED TO DO LOOP OR ASYNCIO IN SHOULD I LEAVE IT AS IS ETC I HAVE MANY BASIC QUESTIONS
I ALSO FIND ASYNCIO DIFFICULT TO ROK I PRETTY MUCH HATE JAVASCRIPT BUT IF YOU NEED WANT TO BE ASYNC IT'S MUCH EASIER TO GET UP AND RUNNING WITH NODE THAT BEING SAID GO CHANNELS AND COROUTINES JUST BLOW VARIOUS ASYNC LIBRARIES AND NODE OUT OF THE WATER

I STILL FIND PYTHON MORE VISUALLY APPEALING THAN GO BUT CONCURRENCY MODEL IS ELEGANT AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND I'M GOING TO KEEP USING PYTHON FOR YEARS AND YEARS BUT I'VE ALREADY STARTED MOVING OVER TO GO WHEN I CAN
SO AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THE LOGICAL CALL CONTEXT THING IT'S ESSENTIALLY JUST A WAY OF STORING DATA ON THE STACK IN A WAY THAT REMAINS ACCESSIBLE TO FUNCTIONS YOU CALL ALONG WITH FANCY STUFF TO CARRY THIS ACROSS NETWORKS OR TO PREVENT IT FROM CROSSING THREAD BOUNDARIES

IN OTHER WORDS THIS

DEF NAME VALUE

POSSIBLY WRAPPED UP IN AN OBJECT OR A DICTIONARY

WHY NOT JUST IMPLEMENT THIS AS A LIBRARY IT'S GOING TO MESS WITH PIPY BUT THAT SHOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO ADDRESS ONCE IT PROVES TO BE USEFUL
YOU SHOULD BE USING R LEARNPYTHON READ THE SIDEBAR BUT I'LL HUMOR YOU

IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE REDIRECTION FOR DEV NULL EVEN THOUGH IT MAY WORK
2 USE THE STOUT KEYWORD ARG NOT A BASH REDIRECT
USE A FOR LOOP TO ITERATE OVER THE LIST
COULD YOU PASTE THE EXACT ERROR MESSAGE

SEEMS LIKELY THAT IT'S A LIST INDEX OUT OF RANGE ON THE AID COUNT

THE PROBLEM SEEMS MULTILAYERED CALLS THE COMMAND EACH TIME THE LOOP IS RUN OMXPLAYER WHEN CALLED MORE THAN ONCE APPENDS THE NEW FILE TO THE PLAYLIST IN THE BACKGROUND SO THIS HAPPENS WHILE THE FIRST VIDEO IS STILL PLAYING THE VARIABLE COUNT KEEPS INCREASING WHEN IT REACHES THERE ARE NO MORE ITEMS IN THE AID LIST THIS IS WHAT IS CAUSING THE ERROR

YOUR SOLUTION WOULD BE CHANGING THE WHILE CONDITION TO THIS

WHILE COUNT LEN AID

THIS WILL PREVENT THE COUNT FROM INCREASING BEYOND THE LIST LENGTH AND ELIMINATE YOUR ERROR
CONSIDER R LEARNPYTHON FOR ASKING QUESTIONS

REPLACE WITH

THE FIRST PART OF YOUR CODE CAN BE REFRACTURED

LIKE SO

AID
FOR I IN RANGE
STR I FILL 2

BUT WE DON'T NEED THAT LET'S JUST USE

AIDS FULL PATH TO VIDEO

IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS SORT OF A BACKGROUND THING SO LET'S MAKE IT LOOP FOREVER

IMPORT ITERTOOLS
AIDS FULL PATH TO VIDEO

WHILE TRUE
SHOULD THINK OF AN EXIT CONDITION
IF
OMXPLAYER B VOL NEXT AIDS

ELSE



OK THAT WAS A BIT BRAMBLY THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BE OUT OF RANGE ON THAT LINE IS THE

AID COUNT

SO TRY PUTTING

PRINT AID COUNT

BEFORE THE TO DEBUG THE VALUES GOING IN
PROTECTING A SCRIPTING LANGUAGE AGAINST ATTACKERS IS HARD AND TRANSFORMING IT IN ANOTHER FORM SUCH AS A BINARY WON'T PROTECT IT FOR LONG WITH SUFFICIENTLY PATIENT AND BACKED ATTACKERS

IF YOU WANT TO SELL YOUR PROGRAM AND TO PROTECT IT THE MOST EFFICIENT IDEA WOULD BE TO BUILD IT AS A WEB APPLICATION WITH THE INTERESTING CODE WRITTEN BUT NOT ALL PROJECTS CAN BE MADE THIS WAY AN OTHER WAY WOULD BE TO REWRITE YOUR PROGRAM IN A COMPILED LANGUAGE LIKE C OCAM BUT REMEMBER THAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO REVERSE THE CODE HE WILL BE ABLE TO DO IT THEY ARE SOFTWARES WHO CAN MODIFY THE CODE TO MAKE IT UNREADABLE BUT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE OR ALREADY BROKEN

THE ONLY SOLUTION FOR TRULY PROTECTED SOFTWARE WOULD BE TO SELL A SECURE COMPUTER WITH THE SOFTWARE INSTALLED ON IT WITH PHYSICAL PROTECTIONS IN IT FOR LIMITED ACCESS BUT THIS IS BEYOND I'M SURE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
MAKE THE SOFTWARE FREE

SELL SUPPORT

COMPANIES THAT WON'T PAY WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT YOUR PRODUCT ANYWAY COMPANIES THAT WILL PAY REALIZE THE BEST SUPPORT LIKELY COMES FROM THE PERSON THAT WROTE IT OFFER CUSTOMIZATION FOR A FEE

IT'S WHY A LOT OF PROJECTS ARE MIT BSD APACHE VS GPL
HOW ONE SUCCESSFULLY COPYRIGHTS PYTHON

I GUESS YOU MEAN HOW ONE COPYRIGHTS SOFTWARE WRITTEN IN PYTHON

IN THE US JUST MERELY BY CREATING POEM A SONG A FILM A PAINTING IS AUTOMATICALLY COPYRIGHTED I MEAN IT IT IS COPYRIGHTED THE MOMENT YOU WRITE IT NOW IF YOU WANT TO REGISTER THAT COPYRIGHT AT THE US COPYRIGHT OFFICE YOU ARE FREE TO DO THAT AND IT WILL HELP YOU DEFEND YOUR COPYRIGHT BETTER SHOULD IT COME TO LEGAL ACTION

A COPYRIGHT IS A LEGAL DEFENSE IF YOU RELEASE YOUR PYTHON PROGRAM AND SOMEONE TAKES THE CODE AND SELLS IT AS THEIR PROGRAM LEGALLY YOU CAN GO AFTER THEM FOR INFRINGEMENT OF YOUR COPYRIGHT BUT OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND IT REQUIRES A LAWSUIT OR AT LEAST AN INFRINGEMENT LETTER USUALLY SENT BY A LAWYER

OF COURSE EVEN IF YOU MADE IT A LITTLE HARDER TO GET AT THE ORIGINAL CODE BY OBFUSCATING THE PYTHON AND MANAGING TO CONVERT IT TO C WITH NUITKA THEY COULD STILL PIRATE YOUR PROGRAM BY JUST PUTTING THE WHOLE PROGRAM UP FOR FREE ON SOME DOWNLOAD SITE RIGHT

THE WAY TO TRY TO INHIBIT THAT IS TO USE SOME KIND OF LICENSING MANAGEMENT PROTECTION SOFTWARE THAT PHONES HOME TO SOME DATABASE TO PROVE THAT THIS COPY IS INSTALLED AND RUNNING ONLY ON THIS MACHINE

SO ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE BASICALLY STEALING YOUR CODE TO COMPETE WITH YOU AS A SELLER OF YOUR PROGRAM OR SOME KID PUTTING IT UP ON A FREE DOWNLOAD SITE


COPYRIGHT IS AS LEGAL MATTER MAKING IT HARD TO COPY THE FUNCTIONALITY CODE IS AN ENGINEERING MATTER
USE COTHON OR NUITKA TO COMPILE TO NATIVE CODE
AS A SECURITY ENTHUSIAST I WILL MENTION THAT

I CAN CRACK YOUR APPLICATION AND FIND OUT WHICH PASSWORD IT'S GOING TO GIVE NEXT AND THUSLY THE ONES BEFORE MINE THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN

2 I CAN JUST SAY THAT THE MORE CHARACTERS YOU'RE RANDOMLY CHOOSING FROM THE MORE SECURE THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE WILL BE FROM REVERSE ENGINEERING IN GENERAL BUT THAT'S NOT ALL

RANDOM IS A FUN MATHEMATICAL CONCEPT WITH NUANCES IT'S GREAT

RANDOM DOESN'T MEAN RANDOM LIKE AS DIFFERENT EACH TIME AS POSSIBLE RANDOM SIMPLY MEANS EVERY LETTER IS JUST AS LIKELY TO GET PICKED BUT THIS IS HARD TO ACHIEVE FOR COMPUTERS AS THEY USE ARITHMETIC OBVIOUSLY TO DO ANYTHING INEVITABLY THERE WILL BE EMERGENT PATTERNS SO USING RAND IS SORT OF A BLACK BOX I'M NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN THIS PART BECAUSE YOU MIGHT ALREADY UNDERSTAND IT AT THIS POINT BUT HERE IS A VERY VALUABLE TOPIC

EVERY RANDOM FUNCTION IN EVERY LANGUAGE HAS CONSISTENCY PROBLEMS YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT IS AND FIX IT IN YOUR CODE TO MAKE BETTER PASSWORDS OVER THE ENTIRE WORLDWIDE USE OF IT MAKE IT INTO A DURANGO SITE

RIGHT NOW IT'S USELESS IN THE CONTEXT OF SECURITY BUT IF YOU READ UP AND GO BACK IT WILL NOT BE AND IT WILL BE MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN EVEN SOME OF THE COMMERCIAL ONES OUR MOMS AND DADS ARE BUYING
OVERALL IT'S PRETTY GOOD A FEW MINOR CRITICISMS MAINLY AROUND USE OF THE STANDARD LIBRARY TO DO THINGS FOR YOU

STRINGS CAN BE TREATED LIKE ARRAYS IN SOME WAYS EAST G HELLO E SO THERE'S NO NEED TO WRITE ALL THE CHARACTERS OUT INDIVIDUALLY JUST WRITE THEM AS A SINGLE STRING
HAVE A LOOK AT FOR PICKING A RANDOM ELEMENT FROM A LIST LIKE OBJECT EFFECTIVELY THE SAME AS WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT YOU COULD ARGUE IT'S A LITTLE CLEARER
INSTEAD OF CALLING MAIN DIRECTLY AT THE END OF YOUR SCRIPT PUT AN

IF

CLAUSE IN FRONT OF IT SO THAT YOU CAN SAFELY IMPORT YOUR MODULE AT A LATER DATE SHOULD YOU SO WISH

DOC STRINGS FOR YOUR FUNCTIONS ARE A GOOD HABIT TO GET IN TO IT ALWAYS SEEMS OBVIOUS AT THE TIME BUT MONTHS LATER

TO GET A BIT PICKY

AS A USER HOW WOULD I GET A PASSWORD WITH NUMBER LETTERS AND SPECIAL CHARACTERS
IN SECURITY STUFF SECURE BY DEFAULT IS A GOOD MOTTO IT'D BE NICE IF THE TOOL HAS SOME SENSIBLE DEFAULT OPTIONS SO I DONT HAVE TO THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT OPTIONS TO USE
MIGHT BE NICE IF YOU COULD SPECIFY A RANGE OF LENGTHS FOR THE PASSWORD

TO GET REALLY REALLY PICKY

DO RANDOM CHARS REALLY MAKE THE BEST PASSWORDS
IS PROBABLY A BETTER THEORETICAL CHOICE IN REALITY IF THIS IS ACTUALLY A PROBLEM FOR YOU THEN YOU'VE GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS IN YOUR LIFE THAN BEING ABLE TO GENERATE SECURE PASSWORDS
I WOULD ADVISE USING ARGPARSE IT'S THE STANDARD WAY OF DEALING WITH CLI ARGUMENTS
YOUR IMPLEMENTATION OF MIXING NUMBERS AND OTHER CHARACTERS IS NOT AS SECURE AS YOU PROBABLY EXPECT RIGHT NOW NUMBERS WILL BE OVERREPRESENTED IN GENERATED PASSWORDS SINCE THERE IS A CHANCE OF A NUMBER GETTING PICKED DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE LESS NUMBERS THAN LETTERS

WHAT YOU PROBABLY INSTEAD WANT TO DO IS TO CONCATENATE TOGETHER THE LISTS OF POSSIBLE PASSWORD CHARACTERS AND THEN PICK A RANDOM ELEMENT FROM THE COMBINED LIST THIS WILL ALSO ENABLE YOU TO RADICALLY SIMPLIFY YOUR CODE
IN IMPORT STRING RANDOM
IN 2 JOIN STRING FOR IN RANGE
OUT 2 EKLVLIBJPHYX

THERE'S ALSO STRING AND PLUS SOME OTHERS

CHECK THE OUTPUT AGAINST A DICTIONARY IDEALLY A CRACKERS ONE IT'S RANDOM SO IT COULD GENERATE PASSWORD IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY
THERE ARE A BUNCH OF ERRORS INCLUDING MODE CAN BE ANY STRING AND THERE WON'T BE ANY OUTPUT AS WELL AS THE PROGRAM EXITING WHEN ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN INT IS ENTERED FOR ALENGTH AND NUMBER MAYBE YOU COULD HANDLE EXCEPTIONS TOO

ASIDE FROM THAT NEAT PROGRAM
THIS IS PROBABLY MORE SUITABLE FOR R LEARNPYTHON

IN ANY CASE IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO USE TO GENERATE PASSWORDS AS THE DOCUMENTATION STATES

HOWEVER BEING COMPLETELY DETERMINISTIC IT IS COMPLETELY UNSUITABLE FOR CRYPTOGRAPHIC PURPOSES

YOU PROBABLY WANT TO USE INSTEAD


WATCH OUT WITH AUTOMATED USE OF GOOGLE THEY MIGHT BLOCK YOU FOR SOME TIME NO REAL PROBLEM JUST SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE
HAVE YOU DOWNLOADED AND EXTRACTED THE SD FOR INSTANTCLIENT
MAYBE THIS WILL HELP

Q
SHARE DATA BETWEEN DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS IN A BIT SECURE MANNER

PICKLE IS NOT SECURE NOT EVEN A BIT THIS WHOLE TUTORIAL IS USELESS BECAUSE IT MISSES A CRUCIAL PART OF PICKLE WHICH IS AT THE TOP OF THE OFFICIAL DOCS

THE PICKLE MODULE IS NOT SECURE AGAINST ERRONEOUS OR MALICIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED DATA NEVER DUNPICKLE DATA RECEIVED FROM AN UNTRUSTED OR UNAUTHENTICATED SOURCE

IF YOU GIVE A TUTORIAL ON HOW TO SERIALIZE PYTHON OBJECTS AND YOU MENTION PICKLE BUT DON'T MENTION THAT WARNING YOU SHOULDN'T BE WRITING TUTORIALS AT ALL
THIS LOOKS PROMISING BUT YOU SHOULD POST THE ENTIRETY OF THE GAME INCLUDING ASSETS TO GITHUB SO PEOPLE CAN EASILY PLAY IT
POSTER TO LEANPYTHON MY BAD
CAN'T YOU DO THE SAME THING IN LINES OF CODE

IMPORT HASHLIB

M HASHLIB SHA
BYTES INPUT ENCODING DTF
PRINT

USING BASE ENCODING IS POINTLESS BECAUSE ANYONE CAN RECOGNIZE IT AND FEED IT THROUGH A DECODER COULDN'T EVEN CLASSIFY THAT AS SECURITY THROUGH OBSCURITY BECAUSE IT'S NOT OBSCURE AT ALL

MULTILINE COMMENTS WOULD CLEAN THIS UP AND DEM GLOBAL THO
THIS REALLY BELONGS IN R LEARNPYTHON YOU WILL RECEIVE BETTER QUALITY FEEDBACK THERE

I WOULD HAVE MADE A TOOL LIKE THIS AUTOMATABLE VIA THE COMMAND LINE SO IT CAN ALSO BE USED BY CODE AND IN SHELL SCRIPTS

EAST G

PATEL 2 CAN NOW BE CALLED FROM ANOTHER PROGRAM

IN ADDITION TO THE INTERACTIVE WAY YOU HAVE IT


INPUT PATEL
INPUT 2
ETC

TO DO THIS IMPORT SS AND THEN READ THE VALUE OF TO FIND OUT THE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS IF AGS ARE PRESENT JUST USE THEM INSTEAD OF THE INTERACTIVE PROMPT KEEP INTERACTIVE MODE IF THERE ARE NO AGS


IMPORT SS
PRINT AGS ARE
WHEN RUN

PATEL 2
AGS ARE PATEL 2

THE PROBLEM WILL BE OF COURSE THAT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO REMEMBER MANY LOW SECURITY PASSWORDS I'M ROLLING MY OWN PASSWORD MANAGER I'LL POST ABOUT IT ON REDDIN SOON
WHY DO YOU HAVE FUNCTIONS THEY DON'T TAKE ANY ARGUMENTS OR RETURN ANYTHING ALL USE GLOBAL VARIABLES AND ALL BUT THE FIRST ARE CALLED ONLY BY THE FUNCTION DEFINITION THAT PRECEDES IT AND THE FIRST IS CALLED EXACTLY ONCE

I BET THERE ARE PLACES LOOKING FOR PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN CODE WRITTEN IN VERSIONS OF PYTHON EARLIER THAN
THE PYTHON SKILLS ARE THE POPULAR ONES YOU CAN BECOME A TWISTED EXPERT OR IRONPYTHON KING BUT YOU'RE GONNA EARN HALF WHAT SOMEONE WITH YEARS DURANGO EXPERIENCE DOES
MACHINE LEARNING IS ABOUT TO BE HUGE I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THIS IS THE BIG THING TO PUT IN YOUR TOOLBAG FOR THE FUTURE
THIS SHOULD GO TO R LEARNPYTHON REALLY

BUT WHY ARE YOU SO NEGATIVE PYTHON WORKS GREAT ON WINDOWS ALSO PYCHARM IS A FANTASTIC IDE THAT ALSO WORKS JUST GREAT ON WINDOWS SO IF YOU'RE STILL LOOKING FOR ONE A FREE COMMUNITY EDITION OF IT IS AVAILABLE FROM THEIR SITE

MOST OFTEN ENCOUNTERED ISSUES ON WINDOWS I GUESS

INSTALLATION ISSUES BECAUSE WINDOWS IS NOT PROPERLY UPDATED AND MISSES SOME MICROSOFT RUNTIME COMPONENTS EASILY FIXED BY HAVING YOUR WINDOWS UPDATES BE ACTUAL
SOME PACKAGES CAN'T BE INSTALLED BECAUSE OF COMPILER PROBLEMS GET PRECOMPILED PACKAGES INSTEAD FOR INSTANCE BY USING THE ANACONDA VERSION OF PYTHON THAT PROVIDES THEM FOR YOU THIS IS NO ISSUE IF YOU ONLY USE PURE PYTHON LIBRARIES
DEPENDING ON OPERATING SYSTEM FEATURES THAT WINDOWS DOESN'T PROVIDE TTY CURSES FORK ETC THIS NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN INTO STUFF WINDOWS DOES ROK

HAPPY PYTHON CODING
I'VE BEEN USING PYTHON ON WINDOWS FOR YEARS WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL EXCEPT THOSE OF MY OWN MAKING YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN PYTHON TOOLS FOR VISUAL STUDIO AND PYTHON FOR WINDOW EXTENSIONS
BETTER TO HEAD OVER TO R LEARNPYTHON

BUT ON WINDOWS I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU INSTALL ANACONDA BASICALLY EVERYTHING SHOULD WORK

DOWNLOADS

EDIT MAKE SURE TO GET PYTHON NOT
SNMP MODULES ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU FITS IF YOU EVER NEED THEM
RELAX GONNA BE ALLRIGHT PYTHON WORKS VERY WELL ON WINDOWS PYCHARM IS EXCELLENT AND WILL DELIGHT YOU
WHAT IS THIS JAVA
I WROTE A COMPILER IN PYTHON FOR A COLLEGE SEMESTER PROJECT I WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN THAT WAY AND CAN'T RECOMMEND IT
I MEAN IT'S MORE SO A PARSER WRITTEN IN PYTHON AS IF IT WERE C BUT STILL A VALUABLE RESOURCE THAT I'M GRATEFUL FOR IMO

IT'S PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO ME BECAUSE IT THE IDEAS IN MY MIND THAT I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN AND GIVES A NICE CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF A POSSIBLE WAY OF REPRESENTING THE CONCEPTS

I NEED TO WRITE A PARSER IN PYTHON FOR A PROJECT I'M WORKING ON SO I LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING THESE IDEAS ON BOARD AND WRITING A NICE PYTHONIC PARSER
HI OP HERE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE DISCUSS THIS ON REDDIN IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN TOLD PROFESSORS HAVE BEEN EMAILING THIS STACKOVERFLOW POST TO THEIR CLASSES

THIS IS BASED SOMEWHAT ON A SLIDE FOR A TALK I GAVE AT PYGOTHAM CALLED THE PYTHON DATAMODEL WHEN AND HOW TO WRITE OBJECTS SEE THE SLIDE AT ABOUT THE TIME MARK

FEEDBACK CRITICISM AND OR ANY OTHER VISCERAL OR INTELLECTUAL RESPONSES ARE ALSO WELCOME
YOU MENTION

I NEED TO PORT FORWARD AND THATS NOT FUN

I CREATED LOCO A FEW DAYS AGO I'LL POST ABOUT IT SOON HERE ON REDDIN BUT MAYBE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO YOU AS IT IS ABOUT PORT FORWARDING

NOT SURE WHY YOU COULDN'T FIND DID YOU LOOK

WXPYTHON IS NATIVE ON ALL PLATFORMS FOR MOST WIDGETS AND PAYT IS CONSIDERED NICE LOOKING AND NEAR NATIVE DESPITE NOT BEING TRULY NATIVE NATIVE HERE MEANS THAT STUFF LOOKS LIKE WHAT THAT OS THINKS IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE
WELL THAT'S TERRIFYING

IS THERE A SIMILAR DB FOR DEATHS PER DAY
CAN ANYONE ELABORATE ON A USE CASE FOR THIS TOOL
INTERESTING SO IT LOOKS LIKE REGISTERS ONE METHOD AS A HOOK AND THEN YOU ADD THAT HOOK TO SOME OTHER METHOD USING A DECORATOR COULD YOU ELABORATE HOW THIS IS ANY BETTER THAN SIMPLY WRITING YOUR OWN CLOSURES AND DECORATING OTHER METHODS WITH THEM

DISCLAIMER I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO READ THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION CODE SO THAT MIGHT ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS A COOL MODULE EITHER WAY

HEY IT'S AWESOME THAT YOU LISTENED TO THE FEEDBACK FROM LAST TIME AND YOU WERE NOT DISCOURAGED AT ALL BY MY CRITICISMS I WISH I CAN GIVE YOU GOLD BUT IT'S PRETTY HARD TO DO THAT HERE

ONE AOL IMPROVEMENT FOR THE BACKTESTING WOULD BE TO SHOW THE RETURN YOU GOTTEN WITHOUT THE YOUR BENCHMARK

FROM THE NUMERICAL PERSPECTIVE THE ONLY THING THAT'S MISSING IS TRANSACTION COSTS FOR SMALL PURCHASES IT'S THE BROKER FEE FOR LARGE PURCHASES IT'S THE MARKET IMPACT OF YOUR TRADES A LOT OF QUANT STRATEGIES LOOK GOOD ON PAPER BUT FAIL TO GENERATE ALPHA IN PRACTICE BECAUSE OF THOSE MAKE SURE TO TAKE NOTE OF THAT

NICE WORK I'M GLAD YOU'RE HAVING FUN BUILDING THIS
COOL STUFF I'M ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING MY OWN TRADING ALGORITHM FROM SCRATCH RIGHT NOW
ASSUMING THAT THIS SYSTEM WORKS IF IT RELIABLY PREDICTS THE STOCK WILL RAISE TOMORROW EVERYONE WOULD RUSH TO BUY THE STOCK AS A RESULT THE STOCK WILL RAISE IMMEDIATELY AND NOT A DAY LATER

IF IT RELIABLY PREDICTS THE STOCK WILL FALL TOMORROW EVERYONE WILL SELL IT AND SO IT WILL FALL TODAY NOT TOMORROW

SO THIS SYSTEM SHOULD BE ITS OWN UNDOING

THIS IS A REMARKABLE FEATURE OF SECOND-DEGREE CHAOTIC SYSTEMS I EAST SYSTEMS THAT ARE CHAOTIC THAT ALSO RESPOND TO PREDICTIONS BEING MADE ABOUT THEM THAT THE SCIENCE IS NOT CURRENTLY AWARE IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THEM

CHAOTIC SYSTEMS EAST G WEATHER ARE PREDICTABLE BECAUSE THE WEATHER DOESN'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT IT IN THE WEATHER REPORTS

THE STUDY OF CHAOTIC SYSTEMS IS OF A SPECIAL INTEREST FOR AND UNDER A FUNDING OF THE MILITARY BECAUSE WAR IS SECOND-DEGREE CHAOTIC SYSTEM
FASCINATING BUT WHY PUBLISH IF IT WORKS SO GREAT
TO SEE WHERE WE ARE GETTING OUR DATA LOOK AT
IVE BEEN WANTING TO GET INTO MACHINE LEARNING AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR A LONG TIME NOW BUT I DOUBT IT IS EVER SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A CAREER OUT OF WOULD YOU SAY DOING SOME FREE COURSES ON THE TOPICS AND STOCK TRADING IS WORTH THE TIME INVESTMENT TO GET A RUDIMENTAL UNDERSTANDING SINCE BUILDING GREAT TOOLS LIKE THIS REQUIRE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF ALL OF THE ABOVE AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE GREAT TOOL BTW WILL BE CHECKING IT OUT
THIS IS A PRETTY COOL IDEA AND I'D BE INTERESTED IN LEARNING HOW TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR WHERE IS A GOOD PLACE TO START HOW DID YOU GET INTO IT

HAS ANYONE OUTSIDE THE OP ACTUALLY TRIED THIS YET

WHAT KIND OF DATA DO YOU FEED IT IS IT ONLY SENTIMENT DATA OR DOES IT INCLUDE OTHER MARKET DATA I'M LOOKING AT THE READE FILE AND JUST WONDERING HOW TO RUN THIS THING DO I NEED TO ADD DATA FIRST OR CAN I JUST RUN THE OUT OF TERMINAL

NUMBER THAT SYNTAX HURTS MY EYES
AN ALTERNATIVE HOW AND FOR WHAT

EVERY POPULAR LANGUAGE IS USED FOR DIFFERENT REASONS I WOULDN'T WRITE AN ANDROID APPLICATION IN PYTHON JUST LIKE I WOULDN'T WRITE A WEB SERVICE IN KATLIN

TOOLS IN A TOOLBOX
IN A WORD UNREADABLE
NEVER HEARD OF KATLIN AND JUST CHECKED IT OUT ON GITHUB

LIKE I SAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT BUT A BUILD FAILURE OF THE MASTER BRANCH ON GITHUB IS NOT REALLY ENCOURAGING ME TO DIG FURTHER INTO IT AT THAT POINT I THINK IT'S A NICE EFFORT BUT I'LL STICK TO PYTHON SCALA FOR NOW STILL IT'S COOL TO SEE THAT THERE ARE EFFORTS IN DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVES
SHOULDN'T THE MORAL OF THE STORY BE TO ALWAYS USE A VIRTUALENV

ESPECIALLY IF YOU USE VIRTUALENVWRAPPER ITS EXACTLY SIMPLE COMMAND

EDIT NEAT HACK THO
THIS WAS A FUN AND HELPFUL STORY AT THE SAME TIME THANKS
BEING A NEWBIE I WAS A AFRAID OF VIRTUAL ENVIROMENT BUT PLEASE IF YOU ARE NEW TO PYTHON LIKE ME PLEASE LEARN HOW TO USE VIRTUALENV IT'S PRETTY EASY


AND IF YOU ARE USING PYTHON YOU CAN USE THE BUILT-IN ENV YOU WILL USE THE SAME COMMANDS JUST REPLACE VIRTUALENV WITH PYTHON M ENV WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW ENVIROMENT
I'VE DONE EXACTLY THIS BEFORE THAT MODULE IS DANGEROUS IF YOU DON'T READ
INSTALL PYTHON MODULES AS SYSTEM PACKAGES NOT THROUGH PIP IF THEY'RE NOT PROVIDED AS SYSTEM PACKAGES MAKE A PACKAGE THEN INSTALL THAT THROUGH YOUR SYSTEM PACKAGE MANAGER

HAVING MULTIPLE PACKAGE MANGERS PER SYSTEM IS STUPID UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN'T DON'T HAVE ROOT THIS IS A BETTER WAY SINCE YOUR PACKAGE MANAGER IS PROBABLY BETTER TESTED AND HAS BETTER SECURITY
NICE WORK I'LL DEFINITELY USE THIS FOR TESTING NETWORK RECONNECT LOGIC IN MY PROGRAMS
MORE STRING FORMATTING METHODS
I'D LIKE TO SEE A SIMPLE AND CONSISTENT WAY OF DECLARING WHICH NAMES IN A MODULE CLASS ARE A PART OF ITS PUBLIC API SETTING FOR MODULES IS FAR TOO AWKWARD AND PEOPLE OFTEN DON'T BOTHER I'M FED UP OF TYPING DIR THING AND TRYING TO SPOT THE USEFUL FUNCTIONALITY AMONGST ALL THE STUFF IMPORTED FROM OTHER MODULES UNINTERESTING MAGIC METHODS INHERITED FROM OBJECT AND PRIVATE INTERNAL VARIABLES

ON A MORE SHALLOW NOTE THEY SHOULD SWITCH TO USING I INSTEAD OF J FOR COMPLEX NUMBERS BECAUSE WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY USE J
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
RESTARTS
A DEFINED C ABI FOR AITS

OOOO YOU WANT JAVASCRIPT PERHAPS YOU COULD TAKE A LOOK AT
WHY WOULD YOU WANT A VAR KEYWORD
FURTHER IMPROVING ON THE PYTHON CHANGES WITH PROPER UNICODE HANDLING ESPECIALLY GRAPHEME CLUSTERS

FOR EXAMPLE FOR REGEL I STARTED USING REGEL INSTEAD OF THE BUILTIN RE MODULE IN SOME OCCASIONS

IT SAYS

THIS NEW REGEL IMPLEMENTATION IS INTENDED EVENTUALLY TO REPLACE PYTHON S CURRENT RE MODULE IMPLEMENTATION

BUT I DON'T KNOW THE BACKGROUND AND NOT SURE IF IT'LL REALLY EVENTUALLY REPLACE RE

FOR EXAMPLE SUPPORTS FULL UNICODE MATCHING GRAPHEMES AND BY UNICODE CODEPOSIT PROPERTIES WHICH THE BUILTIN RE MODULE DOESN'T SUPPORT YET
THE BUILT IN FUNCTIONS AND STDLIB COULD USE A BIT OF REORGANIZATION I UNDERSTAND THE HISTORICAL REASONS FOR WHY THERE ARE BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS LIKE REVERSED AND ENUMERATE BUT IT BE MORE CONSISTENT WITH POLYMORPHIC OOP PRINCIPALS IF THEY WERE METHODS AND RE-USE WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH INHERITANCE THIS HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY HAPPENED WITH EG MOST OF THE CONTENTS OF THE STRING MODULE BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER AREAS WHERE IT'S STILL A WARTY AND WEIRD

I WOULD ALSO LIKE A WAY TO DECLARE ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS WITH STATEMENTS

NOT SURE ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE VAR KEYWORD
CASE STATEMENT
SOLUTION FOR GIL THAT DOES NOT DEPEND ON FULL PURE PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION ON ALL LEVELS WITH OPTIONAL COMPILATION TO C LLM WEBASSEMBLY FIRST-CLASS MOBILE AND WEB SUPPORT OPTIONAL JIT COMPILER FIRST-CLASS PACKAGING SUPPORT FOR DEPLOYING BINARIES OR PACKAGES

A GOOD MULTIPROCESSOR STORY WHERE IS THE PROMISED MULTIINTERPRETTERS
A GOOD STORY ON MOBILE
HIGH LEVEL ASYNCIO MOST PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE LOOP MANUALLY
A TRANSPILER THAN ALLOW YOU TO ALWAYS WRITE THE LASTEST PYTHON AND THAT TRANSPIRE IT TO WORK WITH OLDER PYTHONS

A WAY TO CAPTURE A BLOG OF CODE ESPECIALLY IN WITH BLOCKS

NOT EVERYTHING NEED TO HAPPEN THOUGH I'M QUITE HAPPY THE WAY PYTHON IS

PYTHON AKA HY
HMM MINOR CHANGES IF ANY RELEARNING PRINT AFTER THREE YEARS OF CODING WAS HARD ENOUGH AND THAT WAS JUST A SURFACE LEVEL CHANGE I FEAR THAT IF PYTHON CONTINUES TO INTRODUCE MAJOR CHANGES IT WILL ALIENATE IT'S COMMUNITY OF SUPPORTERS AS LONG AS SUFFICIENT TIME IS SPENT DISCUSSING THE PROPOSED CHANGE AND GETTING COMMUNITY FEEDBACK I THINK I COULD ACCEPT WHAT MAY COME WE ALL NEED TO THINK OF ALL THOSE PACKAGES WE RELY ON
FEEDBACK

AS U FLYNN NOTED IT'S BETTER TO USE CLEAR VARIABLE NAMES
THE STANDARD IS TO USE SPACES INSTEAD OF TABS SEE PEP IF YOU USE A CODE EDITOR LIKE ATOM OR AN IDE LIKE PYCHARM PRESSING TAB CAN AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE FOUR SPACES FOR YOU SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TYPE FOUR SPACES BY HITTING THE SPACE-BAR FOUR TIMES
THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR SCRIPT IS A BIT ODD IT SEEMS THAT PROMPT IS A FUNCTION THAT MANAGES EVERYTHING IT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR CALLING MAIN HUH TYPICALLY THE MAIN NAME IS USED FOR FUNCTIONS THAT MANAGE EVERYTHING SO THIS IS UNUSUAL
YOU'RE USING MANY GLOBAL AND NO FUNCTION ARGUMENTS OR RETURN STATEMENTS READ ABOUT ARGUMENTS KEYWORD ARGUMENTS AND RETURN STATEMENTS HERE IN THE DOCUMENTATION YOU'LL FIND THESE REALLY USEFUL
THERE ARE NO DOCSTRINGS IN YOUR FUNCTIONS PLEASE ADD THEM MAKE THIS A HABIT ASAP THIS WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR FUNCTIONS DO THE BUILT-IN FUNCTION HELP RETURNS THE DOCTORING

JUST TO PRACTICE YOU COULD TRY REWRITING YOUR CODE TO INCORPORATE THIS FEEDBACK USE

A MAIN FUNCTION THAT DOES ALL THE WORK AND CALLS OTHER FUNCTIONS
A PROMPT FUNCTION THAT TAKES NO ARGUMENTS AND RETURNS THE LIST OF WORDS AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE FUNCTION SHOULD BE SHUFFLING YOU CAN USE THIS OUTPUT IN THE MAIN FUNCTION
A FUNCTION RES IS SUCH A SHORT AND VAGUE NAME FOR WHAT IT DOES THAT TAKES THE LIST OF RESULTS AS ITS ARGUMENT

THAT DOESN'T COMPLETELY CORRESPOND TO HOW I WOULD WRITE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS BUT AT LEAST IT INCORPORATES MORE OF THE BEST PRACTICES
GLOBAL L

GLOBAL R

NEVER USE LETTERS AS VARIABLE NAMES IT IS LITERALLY OF THE CODING DEVIL
HAYA

GREAT WORK
AS A NEXT EXERCISE YOU COULD TRY TO DEVISE A DETERMINISTIC WAY TO FIND WORDS WITHIN WORDS SO THAT YOU CAN FIND ALL THE POSSIBLE WORDS WITHOUT HAVING TO DO THAAAAT MANY ITERATIONS

SO YOU GO THROUGH THE DICTIONARY AND TRY TO FIND IF EVERY LETTER OF THE CURRENT WORD IS CONTAINED IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT GREATER OR EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE INPUT IF IT IS YOU CAN PRINT OUT THE WORD FROM THE DICTIONARY


TO ENSURE UNIQUENESS USE A SET

A SET


2
PRINT A
2 A LIST WOULD BE 2

A LIST CHECKS MEMBERSHIP BY CHECKING AGAINST EVERY ELEMENT AND IS SLOW FOR LONGER LISTS A SET DOES THE OPERATION IN CONSTANT TIME IT ALSO DOES THE UNIQUE CHECK FOR YOU WHICH MAKES THE CODE EASIER TO WRITE AND MORE RELIABLE

TO GENERATE ALL COMBINATIONS USE ITERTOOLS READ THE DOCS FOR THE ITERTOOLS MODULE FOR MORE INFO

SUPER ALPHA FEEDBACK WELCOME
ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T RATHER BE WRITING RUBY

I'M ALL FOR CODE GENERATION YOU MIGHT HAVE USED THE THE AST MODULE TO DO THE PARSING FOR YOU THOUGH YOU COULD HAVE USED A DECORATOR INSTEAD OF INVENTING YOUR OWN SYNTAX

HOWEVER I DON'T SEE ANYTHING TO SPECIFY THAT YOU'RE EXTENDING THE STR CLASSICAL AS FAR AS I CAN TELL FROM YOUR TESTS IT'S UP TO THE FUNCTION ITSELF TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON STRINGS THIS EFFECTIVELY WEAKENS STRONG TYPING

ALSO IN YOUR TESTS YOU SPECIFICALLY TEST FOR THE STR CLASSICAL THIS WILL PREVENT IT WORKING ON UNICODE STRINGS OR CLASSES THAT EXTEND EITHER TYPE OF STRING IN PYTHON 2 YOU SHOULD CHECK ISINSTANCE X BASESTRING

YUK THIS IS SOME REAL BEGINNER CODE YOU NEED TO LIVE BREATH AND WRITE PYTHON CODE FOR A LONG WHILE COMPARE YOUR CODE WITH THAT IN THE PY FILES INCLUDED IN YOUR PYTHON INSTALLATION READING SUCH CODE IS A GOOD WAY TO LEARN HOW TO WRITE BETTER CODE

THEN YOU MAY NOT CONSIDER THIS EXTENSION NECESSARY AND ALSO BY THEN YOU MAY KNOW ENOUGH PYTHON MAGIC TO DO THIS IN SEVERAL MORE TRANSPARENT AND MUCH SHORTER WAYS

PLEASE DO NOT WRITE NEW CODE IN THE PYTHON 2 DIALECT AT THE VERY LEAST WRITE CODE THAT IS VERSION AGNOSTIC

PLEASE FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE ENTIRE PYTHON ECOSYSTEM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PEP AND DISTRIBUTING CODE ALL THE DOCUMENTATION YOU NEED IS INCLUDED IN YOUR PYTHON INSTALLATION AND ALSO EASILY AVAILABLE ON THE WEB

CODING CHALLENGES SEARCH FOR SOME ONLINE JUDGES I RECOMMEND URI IT HAS A VERY FRIENDLY INTERFACE AND WELL DIVIDED CHALLENGES REMEMBER TO ALWAYS SEARCH FOR THE BEST WAY TO DO SOMETHING IF YOU JUST KEEP MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES OR BAD PRACTICES LIKE USING FOR I IN RANGE LEN LIST YOU WONT LEARN AS MUCH AS YOU COULD
MIGHT AS WELL LOOK AT PROJECT EULER IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY


ROSETTA CODE
I'VE BEEN DOING FOR A RANGE OF PYTHON PROBLEMS START VERY SIMPLE AND GET MORE COMPLEX ALSO OFFERS HINTS AND YOU CAN SEE OTHER PEOPLE'S SOLUTIONS
DID YOU CHECK THE SIDEBAR WHERE IS LISTED PROGRAMMING CHALLENGES


ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN BIOINFORMATICS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY YOU'LL PRACTICE BUILDING REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS IN THE FIELD
I PERSONALLY ENJOYED GETTING DATA FROM APIS PARSING IT AND JUST MANIPULATING BACK AND FORTH
LET'S SAY YOU LOVE SOCCER FIND A FREE API WITH LET'S SAY MONDIAL STATS AND START EXTRACTING DATA LIKE WHO SCORED THE MOST GOALS WHAT TEAM HAD THE MOST YELLOW CARDS WHO SCORED THE EARLIEST GOAL WHO SCORED THE LATEST ETC
IT'S REALLY FUN IF YOU'RE SPORTS STATS FANATIC
I USUALLY USE THIS WEBSITE
CHECK OUT HETP
CHECK OUT

WELL PYTHON AS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS JUST A TOOL LIKE ANY OTHER

OF COURSE IT'S POSSIBLE TO USE IT FOR BACKING UP A TUMBLR BLOG I SUGGEST YOU JUST IMPORT YOUR BLOG TO A PELICAN INSTANCE IT'S A BLOG INCIDENTALLY WRITTEN IN PYTHON THAT STORES FILES IN CLEAR TEXT FILES HERE'S THE DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO DO THAT
OR YOU COULD USE THIS
I THINK SCRAPING WOULD BE OVERKILL CONSIDER USING THEIR API TO GET ALL SORTS OF STUFF INCLUDING POSTS ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL HAVE TO GENERATE AN OATH TOKEN WHICH IS A PAIN

ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT THE POST DATA CONSIDER JUST PULLING THE RSS FEED I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE RSS THAT OUTPUTS IN EASY TO PARSE XML
SEEMS A BIT COMPLICATED CONSIDERING MANY ROUTERS RUN LINUX OR SUPPORT IT AFTERMARKET WOULD BE LESS OVERHEAD USING TSH

HOWEVER THIS IS A NEAT TUTORIAL INTO TO SELENIUM
THIS DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH DATA MINING MAYBE YOU'RE CONFUSED WITH SCRAPING

I'LL BE ATTENDING MISSED LAST YEAR SO WISH THAT THE CANADIAN DOLLAR DIDN'T SUCK SO MUCH RIGHT NOW
HOW QUICKLY SHOULD I REGISTER I HAVE SOME INFO I NEED TO FIGURE OUT BEFORE I DO BUT I DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT
I ANSWERED YOUR LAST POST YOUR SCRIPT CAN'T DEARTH WPA 2 UNLESS YOU ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT NETWORK IT'S CALLED PROTECTED MANAGEMENT FRAMES

MINUTES IS A LITTLE LONG JUST TO INSTALL DURANGO AND EXPLAIN WHAT IT'S DOING BUT IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO HAVE MORE TUTORIALS SINCE DURANGO CHANGES OF HOW EVERYTHING WORKS IN EACH VERSION

IF YOU WANTED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT INCLUDE SOME QUERY IN YOUR TUTORIAL WHEN YOU BEGIN DOING THE VIEWS TEMPLATES AND MODELS THERE'S NO REASON TO TREAT DURANGO LIKE PHS AND ALL OF THE TUTORIALS CURRENTLY DO THAT AS IF DURANGO IS ONLY COOL BECAUSE IT TIES YOUR DB TO YOUR STRUCTURE

IF YOU SHOW SOMEONE HOW TO MAKE QUICK WEBSITES THAT INTERPRET FROM THE DB ACTIVELY THAT WOULD BE A VERY ATTRACTIVE TUTORIAL I WOULD LINK PEOPLE TO COMPARED TO WHAT'S ON YOUTUBE ALREADY

WOW THIS WAS REALLY WELL WRITTEN AND USEFUL AND FOR ME TIMELY I NEEDED THIS RIGHT NOW AND I APPRECIATE YOU WRITING IT UP I'M ALSO IMPRESSED BY YOUR USE OF MODERN ONLINE TECH JUPITER AND BINDER IN PARTICULAR THANKS
NICE PROJECT THANKS FOR THE POST
FORKED SO IT'S SELF-CONTAINED I EAST INSTALLS THE PACKAGES IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SUCKS YES THERE ARE MANY SENTIMENT ANALYZERS BUT NO THEY ARE NOT VERY GOOD
I'VE ONLY DIPPED MY TOES INTO NLP AND HAD NEVER SEEN THE TEXT BLOB LIBRARY BEFORE LOOKS SUPER USER FRIENDLY THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP

EDIT WOW I'D NEVER SEEN BINDER BEFORE EITHER I USE JUPITER ALL THE TIME BUT DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DISTRIBUTE YOUR NOTEBOOKS IN SUCH A FRIENDLY WAY SO COOL
THIS IS REALLY COOL I ALSO APPRECIATE THE DETAILED WRITE-UP I'M FAIRLY NEW TO PYTHON BEEN PLAYING WITH IT FOR AWHILE BUT ONLY RECENTLY STARTED REALLY DELVING INTO IT BEYOND A BASIC GRASP OF THE LANGUAGE AND POSTS LIKE THIS THAT CLEARLY LAY OUT PROCESS RESOURCES ARE INCREDIBLY USEFUL TO ME SO THANK YOU
DEFINITELY GOING TO THIS FOR MY OWN THANKS FOR DOING THE WRITE UP
POSTS LIKE THIS ARE WHY I ENJOY THIS SUB VERY INFORMATIVE
GREAT NOTEBOOK W EXPLANATIONS

THESE RESULTS ARE SIMILAR TO MY EXPERIENCE DOING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON COMMENTS ARTICLES EAST G USING NOLT

SENTIMENT POLARITY SUBJECTIVITY

THE POLARITY RANGES BETWEEN AND AND THE SUBJECTIVITY IS MEANING IT'S HARD TO MAKE A STRONG POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE CONCLUSION

WHY NO COOL CHARTS I WAS EXCITED TO SEE THE NOTEBOOK BUT WANTED TO SEE SOME COOL GRAPHS AND STUFF
I'M SURPRISED MORE PEOPLE AREN'T UPSET ABOUT THE LACK OF RAM

FOUR YEARS SINCE THE LAST UPGRADE AND THEY STUCK WITH OF RAM NOT EVEN A MEASLY SHAME
REMOVED
THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU CAN'T DO THIS
THAT SEEMS FAIRLY REASONABLE MY ONLY SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO ADD THAT TO THE OBJECT LIKE SO



CLASS FOO
DEF SELF
INIT CODE
TRUE
SELF


DEF SELF
WHILE
SOMETHING
SLEEP

DEF SELF
FALSE

THIS SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE THREAD STOPS AS SOON AS THE OBJECT LEAVES WHETHER IT WAS INTENTIONAL OR NOT
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY HOW I ALWAYS DO IT AT LEAST IN SUFFICIENTLY COMPLICATED PROGRAMS
IT'S NOT BAD BUT MAKE SURE THAT IT'S VERY OBVIOUS THAT IS INTENDED TO RUN IN ITS OWN THREAD A COMMENT IS THE BARE MINIMUM ADDITIONALLY NAME IT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR EVEN BETTER HAVE A METHOD FOO WHICH STARTS THE THREAD WITH TARGET SELF TO CLEARLY MARK THAT SHOULDN'T BE CALLED IN THE CURRENT THREAD
YOU SHOULD PROVIDE MORE DETAILS

HOW WOULD YOUR DESIGN WORK WITH MANY INSTANCES OF THE CLASS
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T YOU WILL HAVE NO WAY OF CONTROLLING HOW MANY THREADS YOU GET IF YOU HAVE MANY OBJECTS

A BETTER PATTERN WOULD BE TO ASK A THREAD POOL TO SCHEDULE YOUR PARALLEL METHOD AND MAYBE PASS A CALLBACK FOR THE RESULTS THIS ENSURES YOU WILL LIMIT THE NUMBER OF THREADS AND MAYBE IF YOU NEED SHARE THEM WITH OTHER CODE THAT NEEDS PARALLEL BEHAVIOR
THIS IS HOW ONE WOULD NORMALLY USE THREAD ANYWAY THE ALTERNATIVE BEING TO INHERIT FROM THREAD
IF YOU BELIEVE THE METHOD WARRANTS A THREAD SURE HOWEVER YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK INTO ASYNCIO INSTEAD SAME CONCEPT BETTER PERFORMANCE I DID THIS WITH A CLASS I'M WORKING ON ESSENTIALLY THE METHOD FOR THE INSTANCE CALLS 2 OTHER INSTANCE METHODS WHICH ARE ASYNCIO COROUTINES BASICALLY A THREAD THESE RUN SIDE BY SIDE AND EVENTUALLY TERMINATE TOGETHER IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHY ASYNCIO IS GOOD AND THE THREADING MODULE IS BAD YOU SHOULD READ UP ON PYTHONS GLOBAL INTERPRETER LOCK
IF IT'S A DAEMON THREAD EAST G GOES ON FOREVER TIL PROGRAM EXIT YOU SHOULD SET THE DAEMON FLAG ON THE THREAD BEFORE STARTING IT WILL THANK YOU
THIS SHOULD BE ALL YOU NEED

QUESTIONS
HI
YOU NEED TO ASSEMBLE THE PARTS YOU NEED

AUDIO LIBRARIES

PYSOUNDCARD IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR THE RAW AUDIO AS IT'S CFF BASED IT WILL WORK IN PIPY

YOU CAN USE FFT FROM BUMPY TO GET USEFUL INFORMATION BACK

AUBIN CAN DO THINGS LIKE FEATURE EXTRACTION

ESSENTIA LOOKS INTERESTING I'VE NEVER TRIED TO GET IT WORKING THOUGH




GRAPHICS

THERE ARE MANY CHOICES HERE IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU WANT

IF YOU WANT TO RENDER USING CAIRO THEN QAIRWAN HAS THE BEST MOST SANE BINDINGS THOUGH LOTS OF LINUX DON'T SHIP WITH OPENGL ENABLED CAIRO WHICH MEANS THINGS CAN END UP TOO SLOW AS SOON AS YOU WANT TO RENDER SOMETHING COMPLEX

OPENGL BASED LIBRARIES

THERE ARE LOADS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT CONSTRAINTS YOU CHOOSE
FOR ME IDEALLY LIBRARIES WORK WITH VIRTUALENV MODERN OPENGL AND ABOVE AND ARE COMPATIBLE WITH PIPY FOR SPEED
YOUR CONSTRAINTS MAY BE DIFFERENT

MODERN GL COMPATIBLE LIBRARIES

COMES WITH LOADS OF EXAMPLES

VISBY LOOKS LIKE A REALLY INTERESTING CHOICE NOT YET COMPATIBLE WITH THE RASPBERRY PI BUT CAN BE USED WITH JUPITER WHICH IS A PLUS FOR PROTOTYPING

BINDINGS FOR SDL 2

HAVEN'T CHECKED COMPATIBILITY

PREGAME

COCOS 2D PYTHON A NICE LOOKING 2D ENGINE I HAVEN'T CHECKED IF IT IS MODERNGL COMPATIBLE

PANDA 3D DOESN'T WORK BY DEFAULT WITH VIRTUALENV



PRE OPENGL

GREAT 2D PRIMITIVES DECENT SPEED

PEGLET PROVIDES TEXT SPRITES


MY CURRENT STACK IS PYSOUNDCARD BUMPY ON PYTHON
I THINK THAT POST USES AN OVERBROAD DEFINITION OF CODE AND USES SCARY LANGUAGE DESCRIBE REALLY STANDARD STUFF LIKE FACTORY FUNCTIONS AND CLOSURES THOSE ARE COMMON STANDARD EVERYDAY FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES THAT EVERY GOOD PROGRAMMER SHOULD KNOW EXPERIENCED PYTHON DEVS MONKEY PATCH EVERY DAY WHEN THEY WRITE TEST CODE

EVERYTHING IN HIS FIRST LIST IS REALLY JUST DIDDLING AROUND WITH OBJECTS AND IDENTIFIERS IT'S ALL JUST ONE ASSIGNMENT OP THAT'S NOT SELF MODIFYING CODE IN MY BOOK IT'S PRETTY DYNAMIC BUT UNDER THE HOOD IT'S JUST REASSIGNING A VARIABLE ALBEIT WITH A POTENTIALLY MAJOR SIDE EFFECT

HE DOES GET INTO THE DEEP MAGIC LATER IN HIS POST WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT MANIPULATING THE PARSE TREE AND BYTECODE AND STUFF THAT'S REAL SELF MODIFYING CODE

IN THE OLD DAYS THERE WAS A BIG DEAL WHEN APPLE CAME OUT WITH THE MACINTOSH BECAUSE IT HAD A CACHE THAT WOULD BREAK IF A PROGRAM MODIFIED IT'S OWN MACHINE CODE IN MEMORY AND FAILED TO PROPERLY FLUSH THE CACHE TURNED OUT QUITE A FEW MAC APPS AT THE TIME DID JUST THAT
SELF MODIFYING CODE WAS SOMETHING WE DID BACK IN THE OLD DAYS IN ASSEMBLER TO EEK OUT THE LAST BIT OF PERFORMANCE OF THE HARDWARE YOU DID IT BY CHANGING THE SPECIFIC BINARY DATA IN SOME HARDWARE ADDRESSES TO DIFFERENT ASSEMBLER

YOU CANNOT DO THE SAME THING IN PYTHON AS YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THE HARDWARE ADDRESSES OF THE ASSEMBLER IT WOULD ALSO BE THE INTERPRET YOU WOULD CHANGE NOT PYTHON

YOU COULD PROBABLY GO AND CHANGE THE PYTHON BYTECODE OF A RUNNING PROGRAM I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO IT IT IS NOT DONE AND WOULD NOT GIVE ANY BENEFITS

SO WHAT IS LEFT FOR ANY MEANINGFUL PURPOSE IS DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE METHODS ON OBJECTS ON THE FLY THIS IS OFTEN CALLED MONKEY PATCHING AND IS A BAD WAY OF CODING FOR MOST PURPOSES IF YOU HAVE A BUG IN SOME OBJECT THAT IS BEING MONKEY PATCHED YOU IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT METHOD ACTUALLY HAS THE PROBLEM

MONKEY PATCHING IS LIKE TAKING A BOOK AND PUTTING THE PAGES IN RANDOM ORDER AND REMOVING THE PAGE NUMBERS SO ALSO A BAD IDEA IT CAN BE USED FOR SPECIFIC THINGS BUT AS A GENERAL METHODOLOGY IT IS BAD

SO I AM SORRY BUT THE ONLY THING THAT IS WORTH THE EFFORT IS TO LEARN HOW TO CODE PROPERLY OBJECT ORIENTATION INTERFACES FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING PATTERNS ETC ETC THERE IS A LOT OF CLEVER STUFF TO LEARN THAT WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER PROGRAMMER
ARMIN RONDACHER WROTE A VERY GOOD BLOG POST ABOUT THIS
CHECKOUT PYTHON METAPROGRAMMING SECTION YOU'LL GET INTO ALL THE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
MONKEY PATCHING SHADOWING BUILTIN

DON'T GET TOO TRIPPED UP ON THE FANCY TERMS THEY USED IT'S JUST SAYING THAT YOU COULD DEFINE A FUNCTION FOO AND THEN DO PRINT FOO AND NOW YOU HAVE MONKEY PATCHED A THE BUILT-IN PRINT FUNCTION OR YOU COULD JUST DEFINE THE NEW PRINT STATEMENT DIRECTLY AND THAT WOULD SHADOW THE BUILT-IN ONE
I ACTUALLY DID MY DISSERTATION AT UNIVERSITY ON SELF MODIFYING CODE IN PYTHON I WILL PM YOU WITH THE RELEVANT PARTS OF MY SUBMISSION THEY WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD STARTING POINT TO EXPERIMENT FOR YOURSELF
FOR AN INTERESTING TO ME AT LEAST FORM OF CODE TAKE A LOOK AT SIXTY PYTHON MUTATION TESTING TOOL COSMIC RAY PART OF WHAT IT DOES IS LOAD PYTHON CODE FROM DISK PARSE IT MODIFY ITS AST AND INJECT THE MODIFIED MODULE INTO THE PYTHON RUNTIME IT MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE
I CREATED A REALLY SIMPLE TYPE OF SELF MODIFYING CODE USING THE BUILT-IN OBJECT TO USE AS A VERSION CHECK FOR MY SCRIPTURE

VERSIONCHECK TEXT
IF VERSIONCHECK VERSION
FROM SUBPROCESS IMPORT CALL
NEWSCRIPT TEXT
WITH OPEN W AS F
NEWSCRIPT
CALL PYTHON
EXIT
IN EXEC AINT DEF PRINT A N ASSESS
IN 2 PRINT
ASSESS

ONLY YOU DON'T NEED EXEC FOR IT ALSO YOU CAN USE

PRINT
DEL OS
IMPORT MAYOS AS OS


SHOOTOUT TO ALL OF YOU GUYS WHO TOOK THE TIME IN POINTING ME TO RESOURCES ESPECIALLY TO U ALI WHO WAS KIND ENOUGH TO SHARE WITH ME PORTIONS OF HIS DISSERTATION I LEARNED A LOT
CHOOSING TO ENABLE CODE IS NOT A WISE IDEA USING EXEC IS TERRIBLE UNLESS YOU CAN CONTROL WHAT IS BEING EXECUTED ALLOWING EXEC ON A CODE WHICH USER SUPPLIES AT RUNTIME IS A HUGE SECURITY HOLE
IT'S NOT THAT HARD

YOU WRITE A FUNCTION AND YOU ALLOW ACCESS TO THE USER TO CHANGE SAID FUNCTION THE OPEN SOURCE GUI I WROTE HAS A SCRIPTING INTERFACE GO AHEAD ADD SECURITY VULNERABILITIES I DON'T CARE IT'S AN OFFLINE PROGRAM

PYTHON IS MORE OF A PAIN I FORGET EXACTLY BUT SOMETHING LIKE VARIABLES LOSE SCOPE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

CLASS A
DEF
SELF X

CLASS B
DEF
SELF X

A B

IT'S THAT EASY YOU CAN DO IT WITH FUNCTIONS AS WELL IT'S EASIER TO DO IT WITH CLASSES AND THAN PURE FUNCTIONS

JUST BE CAREFUL THE SECOND YOU ALLOW THAT CAPABILITY THE SECOND YOU ALLOW FOR ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION YOU BASICALLY CAN'T STOP IT

MIGHT LOOK IN TO THE CODE MODULE IT ALLOWS YOU TO EXECUTE PYTHON CODE
I'M RESEARCHING SELF MODIFYING CODE IN PYTHON AS WELL BUT I'D NOT CONSIDER EXEC OR EVAL A WAY TO GO AFTER DOING IT IN FREEPASCAL ON AND THE NINTENDO DS I CAN TELL YOU THAT EXEC EVAL ARE POOR CHOICES FOR PROPER SELF MODIFYING

BYTECODE AND OBJECT MANIPULATION AND HAVING CODE OBJECTS AT WILLFULLY CHOSEN ADDRESSES IN RAM THOUGH WHICH IS BEING WORKED BY ONE CORE AND MODIFIED BY A DIFFERENT ONE THERE IT GETS INTERESTING AND ACTUALLY WORTH IT IF YOU CARE ABOUT PERFORMANCE
TAKE A LOOK AT PYATT MACRO IMPLEMENTATION AND MACROPSY
ARE YOU AN UNPAID INTERN OR DO BHAT PAY YOU TO POST THEIR SPAM HERE EVERY FUCKING WEEK
I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE THERE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE SOME EXPANSION ON THIS KIND OF THING AT THIS POINT IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO REALLY ROK WITHOUT AN API AND THE EXAMPLE ISN'T ENTIRELY

SOMETHING I'M WONDERING IS WHY NOT INTEGRATE WITH OR OTHER EXISTING FLASK TOOLS FOR AUTHORIZATION AND HOW DOES THIS JASON THING WORK IT SEEMS FAIRLY LIMITING


HETP
ROLES
GUEST
HELLO GET POST
DOCS GET

NORMAL
HELLO GET POST
DOCS GET




SINCE YOU'RE PASSING THE NAME OF THE FILE WITH NO PATH HOW IS IT GOING TO GET DISTRIBUTED IF YOU PACKAGE THE API IN ANY WAY TO ME THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD EITHER LIVE IN A DATA STORE OR LIVE IN SOURCE CODE

2 SINCE THERE ARE NO DESCRIPTORS OF ANY KIND YOU CAN'T EXPAND THIS SCHEMA FOR EXAMPLE HELLO JUST MAPS TO A LIST OF METHODS ALLOWED FOR THAT ROLE WHAT IF I ALSO WANTED TO SPECIFY ANOTHER CATEGORY OF METADATA

WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS AN EXPLANATION PROVIDED

EDIT IT'S AVAIL IN THE JASON FILE I LOOKED IN THE HUMAN VERSION THEN THE OTHER JASON DIDN'T NOTICE THE ONE SORRY I'M INCOMPETENT
I THINK THE IDEA HERE IS TO CATALOG KNOWN AND DOCUMENTED SECURITY VULNERABILITIES EAST G FOR PENETRATION TESTING RATHER THAN TO TRACK PACKAGES THAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED
I DON'T REALLY THINK THIS BELONGS ON SOMEONE'S GITHUB OTHER THAN THE ACTUAL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP IT UP TO DATE AND IT MAKES PROJECTS LOOK BAD
MAYBE THEY JUST NEED A LITTLE CONFIDENCE BOOST
THE AURATED WEB DATABASE IS WAS BROKEN IT GETS STOPPED AT

EDIT NOW WORKING
SO THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND THIS IS NOT A LIST OF PACKAGES WITH INSECURE CURRENT VERSIONS IT IS A LIST PER PACKAGE OF CHANGESETS CONTAINING A SECURITY FIX WHICH IMPLIES DON'T USE VERSIONS X OF THIS PACKAGE USEFUL TO KNOW WHETHER YOU NEED TO UPDATE BUT NOT AFAINT TO KNOW WHICH PACKAGES TO AVOID
THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF CLICKING ON TO GET TO THE DATE WOULD BE NICE TO SEE A LAST UPDATED VALUE ON THE TOP-LEVEL
IT WOULD BE PRETTY COOL TO PUBLISH IN THIS FORMAT
ANY PLANS FOR PROPER COTHON SUPPORT IN PAID VERSION
ANY PLANS FOR PROPER TSH KEY AGENT SUPPORT OR MFA SUPPORT

ISSUE PY

ISSUE PY

EDIT I'LL TAKE THIS AS A NO WE STILL DON'T CARE ABOUT SECURITY
ADDITIONALLY WE VE ADDED A SPECIAL CODE INTENTION INVOKED WITH ALT ENTER TO AUTOMATICALLY CONVERT TYPE HINTS TO VARIABLE ANNOTATIONS SYNTAX

THAT IS A PRETTY NEAT FEATURE LOOKING FORWARD TO USING IT IN COMMUNITY
TO ANY LINUX USER RUNNING THEIR PROJECT IN DOCKER WITH IF YOU'RE TRYING TO USE THE DOCKER INTEGRATION NOTE THAT THE API NRL DEFAULTS TO HETP BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO USE THE SOCKET INSTEAD UNIX VAR RUN
MY CLI LIBRARY THESE DAYS IS CLICK

WHERE DO YOU SEE YOUR LIBRARY FITTING WHEN COMPARED TO RAW ARGPARSE AND MORE LIBRARIES LIKE CLICK
I PREFER THE APPLICATION STYLE USED BY PLUMBUM ALONG WITH ITS MANY AWESOME FEATURES
NICE SHORT AND CONCISELY EXPLAINED ALSO THE REPORTING WITH HTMLTESTRUNNER LOOKS GREAT BUR IT DOESN'T SEEM TO SUPPORT PYTHON
THOUGHT YOU WERE JOKING QUITE THE BUMMER YOU CAN CHECK OUT R ESP IN THE MEANTIME BUZ THERE IS USUALLY SOME GOOD MICROPYTHON TALK ON THERE
I GUESS WORD PYTHON IN MICROPYTHON COULD MEAN SOMETHING ELSE THAN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND THEY WANT TO KEEP IT PRIVATE
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT'S PRIVATE BUT I HAVE FOUND THEIR OFFICIAL FORUMS TO BE PRETTY HELPFUL I'VE ALSO PLAYED WITH IT QUITE A BIT OF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE A MICROCOMMUNITY
I'VE USED UNICORN AND NAGING STATIC MEDIA FILES NUMEROUS TIMES AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO DEPLOY FAST OR YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TIME AND MAKE SURE YOU LOG ADEQUATELY IT'S PRETTY AWESOME
I FOUND OUT THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR ME IS USING UNICORN AND WHITENOSE TO SERVE STATIC FILES NO APACHE NO NAGING CONFIGURATION ONLY PYTHON MODULES

THEN I LOOKED INTO SUPERVISOR AND HONCHO IF I HAVE A DURANGO APP THAT NEEDS ANOTHER PROCESS RUNNING LIKE REDDIN
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED SOMETHING LIKE HEROKU
DURANGO HAS DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO SET UP THE SERVER FOR A PROJECT ITS BEEN AWHILE 2 YEARS SINCE IVE DONE IT BUT I BELIEVE THE ONLY SUPPORTED METHOD THEY DOCUMENT IS WITH APACHE AND I SAW THAT SOMEONE MENTIONED DOCKER WHILE I LOVE DOCKER PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOME KIND OF DATA RETENTION POLICY IF YOU GO THIS ROUTE IF YOU'RE SERVER GOES DOWN AND YOU HAVE NOT BACKED UP THE RUNNING CONTAINER YOU WILL LOSE ANY DATA ADDED AFTER THE CONTAINER WAS STARTED DOCKER IS NOT INTENDED AS A VM REPLACEMENT ITS MEANT TO CONTAINERIZE PROCESSES THAT SAID THE FACT THAT YOU CAN SET UP AND TEST ON LOCAL MACHINE AND DEPLOY WITHOUT ANY CHANGES TO THE DOCKER IMAGE IS A HUGE PLUS IT ALSO MAKES PACKAGING AND MOVING SERVERS A BREEZE USUALLY
THROW MORE HARDWARE AT IT IS OFTEN A VALID AND PRAGMATIC APPROACH IN THIS CASE HOWEVER I'D SUGGEST YOU LOOK INTO STREAMING PROCESSING IT'S A CSF FILE SO YOU CAN PROBABLY READ IT IN ONE LINE AT A TIME PROCESS THAT LINE AND THEN DISCARD IT

WITH THE ADD MORE RAM APPROACH THE LIMIT OF HOW LARGE A FILE YOU CAN PROCESS IN A TIMELY FASHION IS A HARD ONE ONCE THE FILE SIZE SURPASSES THE LIMIT YOU GET SWAPPING AND EVERYTHING SLOWS DOWN TO A CRAWL ADDING MORE RAM MOVES THE LIMIT UP LINEARLY BUT DOESN'T REMOVE IT THE STREAMING APPROACH CHANGES MEMORY REQUIREMENTS FROM LINEAR TO CONSTANT SO THE HARD LIMIT GOES AWAY AND PERFORMANCE SCALES LINEARLY WITH FILE SIZE I EAST LINES TAKE ROUGHLY TIMES AS LONG AS LINE

ADDING MORE RAM MIGHT STILL IMPROVE OVERALL PERFORMANCE BUT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE OS USING SPARE RAM FOR CLEVER THINGS LIKE CACHING AND BUFFERING
NOW THAT'S THINKING LIKE A SYSADMIN
RE PANDAS

MAKE SURE YOU'RE EXPLICITLY SETTING THE FDTYPE OF EACH COLUMN IF SOMETHING IS BEING LOADED AS OBJECT WHEN IT COULD BE FLOAT FOR EXAMPLE THEN YOU'LL USE UP WAY MORE MEMORY
SPIN UP A LINUX INSTANCE WITH MORE RAM
IF YOU AREN'T ALREADY YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO USING GENERATORS BLDR ONLY ONE ITEM AT A TIME IS PROCESSED MEANING YOU SHOULD SAVE ON MEMORY
EVEN IF YOU KNOW PYTHON WELL IT IS STILL REQUIRES EXTRA EFFORT TO PROCESS DATA IN ENVIRONMENTS AND NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE OPTIMIZED MORE RAM CAN SAVE YOU TIME WHEN YOU'RE DOING DATA ANALYSIS IT IS A GOOD INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY IF YOU'RE BUYING A DESKTOP I SUGGEST TO MAX OUT RAM EAST G PUT OR INSTEAD OF IT IS RELATIVELY CHEAP THESE DAYS

OF COURSE LEARNING IS ALSO A GOOD INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY SO PLEASE DO BOTH
IF YOU DO HEAVY WORK ON A LAPTOP MAKE SURE YOUR ADAPTER IS PLUGGED IN AND YOUR POWER SETTINGS ARE ON PERFORMANCE BEST MAX OR EQUIVALENT FOR YOUR OS OR ELSE YOUR OS MIGHT THROTTLE PERFORMANCE CLOCKS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS
DUDE YOU CAN PROBABLY BUY MEMORY STICKS TO INCREASE THE RAM OF YOUR NOTEBOOK SEARCH YOUR MODEL ON GOOGLE AND CHECK FOR COMPATIBLE MEMORY STICKS
I'D PROBABLY GET A BINODE BOX OR OTHER VM AND RUN YOUR STUFF THERE

OR YOU COULD JUST USE SOMETHING LIKE GOOGLE BIGQUERY
HOLY HELL MY PHONE HAS MORE RAM THAN YOUR BENBROOK

EITHER WAY IF YOU ACTUALLY NEED THE ENTIRE DATASET IN MEMORY YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE EXCEPT TO HAVE MORE MEMORY IF YOU CAN USE AMAP TO HANDLE THE FILE IT MAY YIELD BETTER RESULTS FOR YOUR CURRENT SETUP IF YOU CAN PROCESS THE CSF AS A STREAM EVEN BETTER AND YOU COULD STILL USE AMAP TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE
IF YOU'RE ON A BIT OS OR USING A BIT PYTHON YOU MIGHT BE HITTING AN ADDRESS SPACE LIMIT INSTEAD OF JUST A RAM LIMIT WHICH WOULD NOT BE SOLVED BY ADDING HARDWARE

IF IT WERE ONLY A MEMORY ISSUE YOU COULD ADD MORE SWAP SPACE AND ENDURE THE EXTRA TIME IT TAKES

I HAVEN'T USED PANDAS BUT IF THERE'S ANY UNUSED COLUMNS IN YOUR CSF I SEE THERE'S A USECOLS PARAMETER IN ITS FUNCTION TO SPECIFY WHICH YOU WANT TO SAVE MEMORY OMITTING THE REST AND U SOLEIL MENTIONED A FDTYPE PARAMETER
TEMPORARY SOLUTION SWAP PARTITION ON LINUX
MY DESKTOP HAS OF RAM BECAUSE I USE A LOT OF VIRTUAL MACHINES FOR A PARTICULAR TASK I STILL TRY TO OPTIMIZE MY CODE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I LIKE TO THROW LONGER RUNNING TASKS ONTO A PI OR A LINUX SERVER I DON'T WANT THEM TO GET BOGGED DOWN BY RUNNING MULTI SCRIPTS SIMULTANEOUSLY EVEN WITH MULTIPLE MACHINES TO USE I STILL TRY TO OPTIMIZE A LOT
SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE THREAD HAVE POSTED THE VALUE OF BOTH OPTIMIZATION AND MORE MEMORY BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO TRYING TO DO DATA ANALYSIS CAN MEAN VERY DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND DIFFERENT DATASETS IF YOU EXPLAIN IN GENERAL TERMS WHAT YOUR DATASET LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO WITH IT MAYBE RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE MADE FOR WAYS TO OPTIMIZE RATHER THAN JUST THROWING THEORETICAL AROUND
IF YOU GO TO A UNIVERSITY OR WORK FOR A BUSINESS YOU SHOULD INQUIRE TO SEE IF YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO A REMOTE MACHINE MY UNIVERSITY GIVES EVERYONE IN CSC AT LEAST AN ACCOUNT ON A MACHINE WITH JUST SHY OF GB OF RAM THAT IS NORMALLY MOSTLY FREE
YOU HAVE A BAG AND OF DATA IF YOU GET A BAG AND TRY TO PUT OF DATA INTO IT IT WOULD WORK BETTER

UNLESS YOU NEED ALL THE DATA IN MEMORY WOULD IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO TAKE BITES OUT OF THE DATA AND WORK WITH SMALLER PIECES

FLAKER BLOB MASTER

THIS IS PYTHON CHUNKING IT TAKES BITES OUT OF THE DATA INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE FILE
OH GODS YES THE LAST TIME I HAD RAM IN MY LAPTOP I SPORTED A MULLET AND LEHMAN BROTHERS WAS A GREAT BANK

A SIDE EFFECT OF PROGRAMMERS ONLY BUYING LAPTOPS AND CLOUD RATHER THAN BUILDING THEIR OWN HARDWARE RIGS IS THAT THEY FORGET HOW HUGE A DIFFERENCE A HARDWARE UPGRADE CAN MAKE

YOU CAN GET A LAPTOP WITH OR RAM FOR LESS THAN IF YOU MEASURE A PROGRAMMERS TIME AT HR YOUR NEW LAPTOP WILL PAY FOR ITSELF IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS

IF YOU BUILD A WORKSTATION BUYS YOU
RAM
2 X CORE CPU
OF SSD
KICKLESS MB

THAT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY TO EASILY WORK WITH THE DATA YOU'RE CURRENTLY MANAGING

DELETED
GOOD READ THANKS

SOME WORDS ON PERFORMANCE

IF I GOT THIS CORRECTLY IN EACH TESTED FRAMEWORK WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST PENALIZING FACTOR IS SQL ALCHEMY

FILTERING ONLY FOR FLASK FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S TWICE FASTER AT LEAST WITHOUT THE ORM

SORRY FOR THE BIG LINKS ON
DOES SQL ALCHEMY HAVE A MIGRATE FUNCTION LIKE DJANGOS ORM THAT'S SUCH A GOOD FEATURE FOR DEVELOPING AT LEAST CHANGE THE CLASS GENERATE THE MIGRATE SCRIPTS AND MIGRATE THEM IN
I'VE BEEN USING SQLALCHEMY PRETTY HEAVILY FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I'D LIKE TO OFFER A COUPLE OBSERVATIONS SOME THINKING ABOUT HOW WE BUILD THINGS

FIRST HAVING USED ORMS OVER THE LAST YEARS ELOQUENT MOSTLY SQLALCHEMY IS TOP TIER REALLY GREAT AND PRODUCES VERY READABLE CODE IN CONTROLLERS SO IN SOME SENSE I'M A FAN OF IT

ON THE FLIP SIDE THOUGH MANY JOINS THINGS WE WANT OUT OF OUR DATABASES ARE NOT VERY SIMPLE AND WHENEVER I TRY TO GET SQLALCHEMY TO HANDLE THOSE SITUATIONS I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO WRITE IT IN SQL IN MY HEAD OR PGADMIN AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRANSLATE THAT TO SQLALCHEMY THIS IS GENERALLY A SLOW BUGGY PROCESS THAT INVOLVES LOTS OF LOOKING AT THE QUERY LOG AND FIGURING OUT IF THE SQL THAT SQLALCHEMY GENERATED IS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT I THINK IT SHOULD BE BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST ME NOT HAVING ENOUGH EXPERIENCE WITH IT

SO THE AMOUNT OF TIME I'VE SPENT DEBUGGING COMPLEX SQLALCHEMY QUERIES HAS LED ME TO THINK ABOUT THINGS THIS WAY

IF THE QUERY I WANT TO DO IS SIMPLE A PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY JOIN MAYBE A SUM DO IT VIA SQLALCHEMY ANYTHING MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT I SIMPLY MAKE A VIEW IN THE DB AND THEN ADD A SQLALCHEMY MODEL THAT WAY I'M DOING ALL THE COMPLEX STUFF IN SQL WHICH I HAD TO DO ANYWAY

THINKING ABOUT THINGS THAT WAY HAS ALSO LED TO ME WONDER IF I SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A SIMPLER ORM IF ALL I'M DOING NOW IS SIMPLE JOINS DO I REALLY NEED SQLALCHEMY IF I WAS STARTING A PROJECT FROM SCRATCH TODAY I THINK I'D BE LEANING TOWARDS THE SIMPLEST STUPIDEST ORM POSSIBLE BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY SOLIDIFIED MY THINKING ON THIS

WHAT ARE EVERYONE'S THOUGHTS ON THIS
NO SQL IS REQUIRED TO CREATE MAINTAIN AND QUERY THE DATABASE

I DON'T THINK THIS IS ENTIRELY TRUE TECHNICALLY YES BUT ONCE YOU START MOVING BEYOND BASIC QUERIES INTO EVEN JUST JOINING ACROSS THREE OR MORE TABLES A HEALTHY UNDERSTANDING OF SQL MAKES USING SQLALCHEMY MUCH MORE INTUITIVE

IF I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH RETRIEVING DATA I'LL OFTEN THINK OUT HOW I'D APPROACH THE QUERY IN RAW SQL AND DERIVED MY SQLALCHEMY EXPRESSION FROM THAT
SQLALCHEMY MAY BE THE SINGLE BEST LIBRARY EVER MADE
HOW DOES IT HANDLE COMPLEX QUERIES

LIKE I HAD AN APPLICATION AT AN OLD JOB THAT I MADE THAT HAD SOME PRETTY COMPLEX QUERIES ACROSS A LOT OF TABLES THAT RETURNED A LOT OF DATA I CAN'T SEE HOW THAT COULD BE DONE WITH THIS
THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE ABOUT SQLALCHEMY IS THE USE OF EXPRESSIONS AND ORM

IT MAKES FLASK ADMIN MAINTENANCE VERY HARD COMPLEX FILTERS QUERIES THAN DURANGO ORM
I'VE NEVER USED THE SQLALCHEMY ORM JUST THE SQLALCHEMY CORE

IT'S FAST SAFE AND WRITING WRAPPER CODE IS SIMPLE ENOUGH
SERIOUS QUESTION DOES RELYING ON SQLALCHEMY MAKE YOUR SKILLS LESS VERSATILE I AM NOT ARGUING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER JUST ASKING

I KNOW ABOUT DATABASES BUT MY WIFE WORKS IN THEM ALL THE TIME I WAS TELLING HER ABOUT THIS POST AND SHE POINTED OUT THAT SHE CAN WRITE THE SAME OR CLOSE TO IT SQL QUERIES IN NET AS SHE DOES IN JAVA ETC SHE DOESN'T USE PYTHON THE SKILL TRANSLATES WELL IS THAT AN ISSUE WITH RELYING ON SOMETHING LIKE SQLALCHEMY
ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT SQLALCHEMY IS HOW IT SEPARATES THE DB INTERACTION LAYER FROM THE ORM LAYER YOU CAN STILL GET A LOT OF BENEFITS OUT OF SQLALCHEMY WHILE COMPLETELY IGNORING ALL THE ORM STUFF AND JUST WRITE PLAIN TEXT SQL
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THE PARTICULAR SOFTWARE LICENSE THAT THE AUTHOR OF THE LIBRARY DECIDED TO USE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS HERE'S A GOOD SPOT TO GET STARTED

SOFTWARE LICENSING
BASICALLY YOU CAN USE ANY LIBRARY THAT HAS A LICENSE THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE WAY YOU INTEND TO LICENSE YOUR APPLICATION

GENERALLY SPEAKING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOUR APPLICATION OPEN SOURCE FREE SOFTWARE YOU NEED TO AVOID LIBRARIES WITH COPYLEFT LICENSES LIKE THE GPL BECAUSE BY USING THEM IN CERTAIN WAYS YOU WILL END UP HAVING TO PROVIDE YOUR SOURCE CODE UNDER THE SAME LICENSE ALWAYS READ THE LABEL YOU CAN FIND MIT OR BSD LICENSED LIBRARIES THAT ALLOW YOU TO USE THEM IN APPLICATIONS

I WOULD HOWEVER ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE YOUR PROGRAM SOURCE CODE FREELY AVAILABLE UNDER A LIBERAL OR COPYLEFT LICENSE BECAUSE THEN YOU ARE NOT ABUSING THE SOFTWARE FREEDOMS OF YOUR USERS YOU CAN STILL SELL IT OF COURSE
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN YOU MORE TECHNICAL ANSWERS AROUND LICENSING I'LL TRY TO GIVE A BROADER OVERVIEW

FIRSTLY IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL IN PROGRAMMING TO USE LIBRARIES OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN MOST OF THE INTERESTING STUFF WE DO WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IF EVERY PROGRAMMER HAD TO WRITE THEIR OWN LIBRARIES FROM SCRATCH BUT THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS THIS WORKS

SOME LIBRARIES ARE COMMERCIAL IF YOU WANT TO USE THEM YOU PAY THE CREATORS OR THE COPYRIGHT OWNERS TO BE PRECISE THIS MAY BE A ONE OFF PAYMENT OR BASED ON HOW MANY USERS YOU HAVE

THERE'S ALSO A LARGE ECOSYSTEM OF OPEN SOURCE LIBRARIES WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT IS POSSIBLE TO CHARGE FOR AN OPEN SOURCE LIBRARY BUT IT'S UNUSUAL HOWEVER YOU USUALLY NEED TO CREDIT THE CREATORS OF OPEN SOURCE LIBRARIES YOU USE BY INCLUDING THEIR COPYRIGHT NOTICE SOMEWHERE IN YOUR PROGRAM EAST G IF YOU USE FIREBOX GO TO ABOUT LICENSE TO SEE A BIG LIST OF CODE IT USES UNDER DIFFERENT LICENSES

SOME OPEN SOURCE LIBRARIES CAN ONLY BE USED IF YOUR CODE IS OPEN SOURCE AS WELL THIS IDEA IS CALLED COPYLEFT AND THE MAIN LICENSE FOR CODE LIKE THIS IS THE GPL BUT DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THE DETAILS OF DIFFERENT LICENSES WHILE YOU'RE MESSING AROUND
THE SHORTEST ANSWER TO JUST THE TITLE IS

IT'S CLOSE TO UNETHICAL NOT TO
IN CASES WHERE ALL I NEED IS A SIMPLE GUI ON TOP OF A COMMAND LINE PROGRAM I HAVE HAD GOOD LUCK WITH GOOEY

I WROTE AN ARTICLE HETP ABOUT IT AS WELL
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT IS ALREADY SOLVED BY SEVERAL APPLICATIONS PLUNK ELASTICSEARCH MS POWER BI TABLEAU ETC I WOULD USE AN PRODUCT SUPPORTING AN REPORTING ANALYSIS PROGRAM SEEMS VERY MESSY PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE PRODUCTS THAT DO IT ALREADY
TIPS

DON'T USE CAT TO READ FILES AT THE TERMINAL USE A PAGER LIKE LESS YOU GET NICE ADDITIONAL FEATURES LIKE SEARCH
2 IF YOU NEED TO REMOVE ENTRIES FROM USE R THAT REMOVES THE PROVIDED HOST FROM WHILE SAVING A BACKUP
IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH VMS OR MACHINES THAT GET WIPED OUT OFTEN APIS OFTEN ENOUGH FOR HOST KEY CHECKING TO BE AN ANNOYANCE USE TSH O USERKNOWNHOSTSFILE DEV NULL O STRICTHOSTKEYCHECKING NO TO USE A BLANK FILE AND DON'T PERFORM STRICT HOST KEY CHECKING THIS WOULD NOT BE SECURE CONNECTING TO PRODUCTION MACHINES BUT IT'S PROBABLY OK IN A LAB ENVIRONMENT

DON'T STOP WRITING UTILITIES BUT IT ALSO HELPS TO LEARN YOUR EXISTING TOOLS YOU CAN USE EXISTING TOOLS TO WRITE MORE ROBUST OR USEFUL UTILITIES OR SAVE THE EFFORT LEARNING THE TOOLS THAT ARE ON THE SYSTEM BY DEFAULT ALSO MEANS YOU DON'T NEED AN EXTRA DEPENDENCY TO MAKE YOUR WORKFLOW ACTUALLY WORK
IT WOULD BE NICE TO ADD SOME SAMPLE OUTPUT BOTH THE SOURCE FILE AND OUTPUT IN THE READE SO WE CAN SEE WHAT YOU MEAN BY PARSE OUT WITHOUT HAVING TO READ THE CODE
WAS THERE A REASON YOU USED PYTHON INSTEAD OF POWERSHELL I SEE YOU'RE AT BSFT SO I PRESUME YOU'RE USING WINDOWS BUT MAYBE I'M MISTAKEN
VERY USEFUL FOR NEWIES THANKS
DID YOU ALREADY USE SUPERVISOR JUST DISCOVERED WITH YOUR POST AND IT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT MORE ADVANCED ANY THOUGHTS
IF YOU FULLY EXECUTE YOUR REFERENCE NOTEBOOK AND THEN COMMIT IT INTO YOUR REPOSITORY IT'LL RENDER WITH ALL YOUR OUTPUT AND PLOTS WHEN PEOPLE VIEW IT ON GITHUB YOU DO THIS FOR THE ROC CURVE AND MODELING NOTEBOOK BUT NOT YOUR EXAMPLE TEMPLATE ONE WHICH YOU LINK TO IN THE READE COME TO THINK OF IT THOSE AREN'T YOUR NOTEBOOKS ARE THEY AT LEAST THE MODELING ONE ISN'T IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE PMC TUTORIAL NOTEBOOKS ALTHOUGH I COULD BE WRONG IF IT IS YOU REALLY NEED TO PROVIDE A CITATION OR REFERENCE TO THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR

THAT BEING SAID WHAT PROBLEM IN PARTICULAR DOES YOUR PACKAGE SOLVE MOST OF THE TASKS IN MY DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW ARE EASILY SATISFIED ALREADY WITH THE VERY HIGH-LEVEL INTERFACES OF STATSMODELS SKLEARN PANDAS AND SEABORN EVEN MY INTERMEDIATE COMPLEXITY TASKS ARE USUALLY JUST A FEW LINES OF CODE AND IT'S EASIER TO CRAFT THAT EXTRA FUNCTION WHEN I NEED IT TAILORING IT TO THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION I'M WORKING ON
I CODED HEML SITES IN SOUTH I WANT TO CODE FULL FEATURE SITE IN PYTHON CAN ANYONE ADVISE ON THIS INITIALLY FREE SETUP
THIS LOOKS LIKE AN ADAPTATION OF
ATOM ISN'T REALLY EVER GOING TO BE AS COMPLETE AS ECLIPSE PYDEV IN TERMS OF BEING A COMPLETE IDE IT'S REALLY A TEXT EDITOR WITH SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING AND A BASIC PUGIN SYSTEM

THE PACKAGES I USE WITH IT FOR PYTHON DEV

MAGICPYTHON BETTER PYTHON SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING SUPPORTS ASYNC PARAMETER ANNOTATIONS IN PARTICULAR
RUN PLAINT CONTINUOUSLY ON YOUR CODE AND ADD A RED SQUIGGLY UNDERLINE TO PARTS WHICH DON'T CONFORM
HYDROGEN INTEGRATES ATOM WITH JUPITER YOU GET THE INTERACTIVITY OF PYTHON AND THE LITERATE PROGRAMMING OF THE NOTEBOOK IN YOUR EDITOR
PYTHON STUFF

MAGICPYTHON FOR SYNTAX ESPECIALLY IF USING PYTHON WITH MOPY TYPE HINTING
LINTER GENERAL LINTER WITH PLUGGING AVAILABLE FOR MANY LANGUAGES
FLAKE PUGIN FOR LINTER COMBINES PEP AND FLAKE



GENERAL DEV STUFF

FOR SAVING PROJECTS



OTHER VISUAL STUFF I LIKE

MINIMA FOR THAT SUBLIME LIKE FILE MINIMA
FONTS MORE MONOSPACE FONTS INCLUDING MELLO
SHOW ICONS IN GREENVIEW BASED ON FILE TYPE
I KNOW THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU ASKED

BUT HAVE YOU TRIED PYCHARM
THIS ISN'T REALLY WHAT YOU ASKED BUT IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT I REALLY LIKE THE PUGIN FOR ATOM

ALSO TO SETUP PROJECTS YOU COULD ALWAYS USE A TOOL LIKE COOKIE CUTTER BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE INTEGRATED WITH YOUR EDITOR
AUDREY COOKIECUTTER
CLASSIC ONE EMET
PUGIN
SNYDER ALSO HAS CELLS THAT ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS HOW TO DEFINE A CODE CELL IN AN IDE

FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SNYDER EDITOR YOU CAN SEPARATE CODE CELLS BY LINES STARTING WITH STANDARD CELL SEPARATOR

CTRL ENTER WITHIN A CELL RUNS THAT CURRENT CELL ONLY
SHIFT ENTER WITHIN A CELL RUNS THAT CURRENT CELL AND GOES TO THE NEXT CELL

HOPE THIS HELPS
IF YOU USE ATOM YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK OUT THE HYDROGEN PACKAGE WHICH LETS YOU DO STUFF THAT'S SIMILAR TO JUPITER INSIDE AN EDITOR

THE SUBLIME TEXT PUGIN API HAS ALSO BEEN IMPROVED IN THE LAST YEAR SO SOMEONE MIGHT MAKE SOMETHING EQUIVALENT HERE TOO
I USE JUPITER NOTEBOOKS ARE MAINLY FOR EXPLORATION AND PYCHARM OR VIM FOR WRITING FILES I ALSO USUALLY HAVE A JUPITER QTCONSOLE OPEN AS WELL ATTACHED TO THE SAME KERNEL

WHEN I WANT TO FINALLY CLEAN SOMETHING UP I EITHER EXPORT IT INTO A PYTHON FILE OR COPY PASTE IT INTO MY IDE AND SAVE IT FOR FUTURE USE

AT LEAST JUPITER HAS TAB COMPLETION AND DOCSTRINGS ETC I GUESS AND YOU CAN RELOAD AUTOMATICALLY IS POSSIBLE TOO I THINK PYTHON FILES WHENEVER THEY ARE SAVED SO EXPLORE WRITE FINAL VERSION OF FUNCTION USE IT IN THE NOTEBOOK FOR FURTHER EXPLORATION
WHO USES JUPITER FILES FOR DEV THEY'RE FANTASTIC FOR DOCUMENTATION BUT I SEE NO WAY IN WHICH THEY'RE MEANT TO SUPERSEDE A PROPER IDE OR EVEN VIM EMACS FOR THAT MATTER
I USE MICROSOFT VS AND IT WILL LET YOU SELECT WHATEVER CODE YOU WANT RIGHT CLICK IT AND SEND IT TO INTERACTIVE MODE WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT WORK

ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN DEBUG THE CODE LINE BY LINE STEPPING THROUGH THE CODE YOU CAN ADD WATCHES TO WHATEVER VARIABLES YOU WANT YOU CAN VISUALLY SEE YOUR DATA STRUCTURES BY HOVERING YOUR MOUSE OVER THEM AND SELECTING THE LISTS AND DCTS THESE OBVIOUSLY CHANGE AS YOU STEP THROUGH YOUR CODE AND IT IS NICE BEING ABLE TO SEE HOW THE DATA STRUCTURES REACT TO EACH LINE OF CODE YOU CAN ADD STOPS AT CERTAIN POINTS IN YOUR CODE TO SPEED THE PROCESS UP AND NOT HAVE TO GO LINE BY LINE
YOU CAN WORK WITH JUPITER NOTEBOOKS IN WAYS OTHER THAN VIA THE BROWSER INTERFACE THE JUPITER NOTEBOOK SERVER EXPOSES A CLIENT API SO YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS IF YOU D LIKE I M AFRAID I CAN T PROVIDE AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF CLIENTS IMPLEMENTATIONS THOUGH I HAVE USED NOTEBOOKS FROM WITHIN EMACS AT THE TIME HOWEVER
AM I MISSING AN OBVIOUS DEVELOPMENT METHOD THE PRODUCTIVITY BEASTS USE DAILY

PYCHARM HAS SUPPORT FOR JUPITER NOTEBOOKS YOU CAN HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO
YOU CAN CONFIGURE PYCHARM TO RUN PYTHON WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO RUN JUST BLOCKS OF CODE INTERACTIVELY WHEN I WORK IN PYCHARM I TYPICALLY HIGHLIGHT WHATEVER BATCH OF CODE I'M WORKING ON AND PUSH THE EXECUTE SELECTION IN CONSOLE HOT KEY ALT SHIFT E
JUPYTERLAB IS LOOKING TO FILL THAT GAP THOUGH IT'S STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

THERE ARE ALSO WAYS IN OTHER EDITORS TO HIGHLIGHT LINES AND SEND THEM TO A REPL IN PYCHARM YOU CAN CONFIGURE A HOTKEY FOR THIS THOUGH SNYDER IS PROBABLY A BETTER FIT FOR DATA ANALYSIS WORK
MANY INTERESTING TIPS IN THIS TOPIC BUT ONLY A FEW MENTIONS OF RODEO I PERSONALLY STICK WITH NOTEBOOKS BUT STUDIO IS GREAT AND RODEO LOOKS LIKE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE FOR PYTHON
YOU'RE NOT REALLY MISSING ANYTHING WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED IS EXACTLY THE REASON THE JUPITER NOTEBOOK EXISTS TRADITIONAL IDES AREN'T SUITABLE FOR SCIENTIFIC WORK
IT REMINDS ME A RECENT THREAD ABOUT WORKFLOWS IN PYTHON YOU MAY FIND IT INTERESTING
YOU CAN RUN BLOCK OF CODE IN PYTHON CONSOLE USING PASTE PYTHON MAGIC COMMAND I USE JUPITER NOTEBOOK TO EXPLORE DATA OR DOCUMENTATION OTHERWISE I USE SUBLIME TEXT PYTHON PASTE
THAT IS WHAT JUPYTERLAB AND INTERACT ARE ADDRESSING BUT HAVE YOU TRIED PTIPYTHON WHICH COMES WITH AUTOCOMPLETION AND ERROR CHECKING IT IS SLOWLY INTEGRATING INTO PYTHON PROJECT

SO SIMPLY JUMP BETWEEN PYCHARM JUPITER SNYDER RODEO AND PTIPYTHON
I DO MOSTLY DATA SCIENCE TYPE WORK AND SPEND THE MAJORITY OF MY TIME WORKING IN NOTEBOOKS ONCE I'M HAPPY WITH MY DEVELOPMENT SOLUTION I CLEAN UP THE NOTEBOOK AND EXPORT TO PY FILE THEN I LOAD UP MY EDITOR AND CLEAN IT UP TO REMOVE ANY JUPITER ARTIFACTS

I WORK IN DATA SCIENCE AS WELL AND AT THE MOMENT I DON'T USE JUPITER AT ALL

WHAT I DO IS SPEND A GREAT AMOUNT OF TIME IN USUALLY BUILD OUT THE BASICS OF THE SCRIPT THAT GETS MY DATA INTO THE RIGHT FORM THEN I SET BREAKPOINT AND GET STUCK IN WITH THE DEBUGGER

I PREFER THE DEBUGGER APPROACH BECAUSE I TEND TO FEEL LIKE THE NOTEBOOK APPROACH BE IT R OR JUPITER TEND TO LET ME DO TOO MUCH AND I LOSE THE THREAD OF WHAT OPERATIONS AND METHODS I ATTEMPTED ON THE DATA TO GET THAT RESULT STRUCTURE IS I FIND I LOSE REPEATABILITY WITH THEM

THE DEBUGGER SETUP HELPS ME ENSURE THAT WHATEVER I START FROM THE SAME PLACE AND THAT MY DATA STRUCTURES AND TYPES ALL REMAIN CONSISTENT AND REPEATABLE

AS SOMEONE WHO JUST GOT A MAC THIS IS SUPER USEFUL THANK YOU
SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR HAND OFF THE KEYBOARD AND GRAB A MOUSE NO THANKS
I'VE USED A FEW TIMES TO QUICKLY TEST PYTHON CODE AND I FOUND THAT IT'S A VERY GOOD TOOL IT'S MORE PRACTICAL THAN USING THE PYTHON CONSOLE ESPECIALLY IF YOU WORK WITH SEVERAL SOURCE FILES NICE TO SEE THAT THEY ADDED ALL PACKAGES
SEEMS INTERESTING BUT MATPLOTLIB AND RATCAVE DIDN'T IMPORT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ACTIVATED OR SET FOR THESE PACKAGES
HUH MY PACKAGE IS ON THERE

NOW I JUST NEED TO UPDATE THE VERSION ON PIP
THAT'S FANTASTIC WOW DEFINITELY GOING TO USE IT TO CHECK OUT LIBRARIES BEFORE INSTALLING THEM

BUT AT THE MOMENT IMPORT REQUESTS DOESN'T WORK AT ALL NO RESPONSE IN THE REPL
IT'S REALLY NEAT TO SEE MY PACKAGE IN HERE PYSPARKLINES IMPORT SPARKLIKE

HOW ARE YOU RESOLVING MODULE NAMESPACE ISSUES I'M SURE THERE MUST BE OVERLAP IN PEPI
IMPORT FAILS
ON THE GIF IT SHOWS IT IMPORTING PREGAME BUT IF YOU TRY TO RUN A PREGAME SCRIPT IT SAYS NO AVAILABLE VIDEO DEVICE I UNDERSTAND WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE PRACTICAL TO RUN PREGAME SCRIPTS BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING
HOW DOES THIS WORK
I WASNT ABLE TO IMPORT NOLT POSSIBLY ANOTHER BUG
THE FOLLOWING FAILS ON PYTHON 2

I COULD EASILY BE DOING SOMETHING WRONG THOUGH COOL CONCEPT STILL
HOLY COW THIS IS AMAZING
SWEET SOMEONE ELSE HAS FINALLY INSTALLED MY AVG SELECT WIDGET FOR DURANGO
IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT MANY PACKAGE BEHAVIOR ARE CHANGED BY ENTRYPOINTS EG ALL NOSE PLUGGING PERTEST PYTHON THEN THIS IS A STRANGE CHOICE KEEP IN MIND THAT SEVERAL PACKAGES CAN BE BEHIND THE SAME IMPORT FOR EXAMPLE PIL AND PILLOW ARE BOTH IMPORT PIL INSTALLING BOTH MAKE NO SENS HAVE YOU CONSIDERED USING SOMETHING LIKE WHAT CONDA DOES WHERE ALL PACKAGES ARE ON THE FILESYSTEM BUT CAN JUST BE QUICKLY HARDLINKED TO THE CORRECT LOCATION TO MAKE INSTALLATION A STEP
IMPORT ARCADE FAILS
DELETED
TRIED IMPORT CERAS AND THE PROMPT HANGED
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REPL AND ANACONDA
VERY COOL WELL DONE
SCRAPY ISN'T ON THERE
ARE YOU GUYS PLANNING ON INCLUDING CIVY
IMPORT SABINO FAILS WITH BEING A PEPI HOSTED PACKAGE
CLEARLY I MISSED SOMETHING IT DOESN'T WORK EVEN ON BUMPY IT WORKS EXACTLY LIKE THEIR GIF DOES IT RETURNS NONE
IS IT POSSIBLE TO DISABLE SOME PACKAGES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I CAN'T USE PILLOW BECAUSE IT'S NAMESPACE IS OVERWRITTEN BY PIL
I HAVE A LIBRARY DEALING WITH I O NAMELY ARGUMENT PARSING IT SOMETIMES PRINTS TO STADER AND ALWAYS EXITS ON STADER IS SWALLOWED AND EXIT BREAKS THE CONNECTION UNLIKE THE PYTHON REPL WHICH JUST CATCHES THE SYSTEMEXIT EXCEPTIONS I COULD DETECT WHETHER WE'RE IN AND ADJUST ACCORDINGLY BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE CLEANER IF YOU ADDRESSED THESE ISSUES

FINALLY IS SUITABLE FOR EMBEDDING IN GENERATED DOCUMENTATION
WHAT LINUX BISTRO IS INSTALLED ON LOOKS LIKE THIS IS NEITHER CEBIAN UBUNTU AS MY PACKAGE WORKS FINE ON THESE BUT FAILS ON ON PYTHON THROWS ERROR ABOUT FORETYPE LIBRARY MISSING AND ON PYTHON ERROR ABOUT GLIB MODULE LIBRARY MISSING
NICE THAT WORKS VERY WELL I CAN INCLUDE RUNNING EXAMPLES IN MY PROJECTS AS IN

SHOULD BE NICE IF I CAN EMBED THIS CAN I
IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET HY
IS OPEN SOURCE CAN I RUN IT ON MY OWN SERVER
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR CODE ONCE YOU OPEN SOURCE IT WITHOUT SPENDING A CENT SOME KIND INDIVIDUAL MAKES IT ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE OVER THE WEB
PYTHON 2 DEFAULT DEC
GCC 2 ON LINUX
IMPORT NISTBEACON
TRACEBACK MOST RECENT CALL LAST

IMPORTERROR NO MODULE NAMED NISTBEACON

SO IT'S NOT EVERY PACKAGE BECAUSE MINE ISN'T WORKING MIND CLARIFYING U AMASA
IF YOU'RE GETTING THINGS OFF OF PEPI WHY IS THE VERSION OF MY PYRO THAT IS INSTALLED SO ANCIENT IT HAS FROM YEARS AGO CURRENT IS
SO OF THOSE OF US WHO HAVE PACKAGES ON PEPI MANY HAVE NOW UPDATED THOSE PACKAGES WHAT IS YOUR UPDATE SCHEDULE FOR PACKAGES OR IS THAT NOT YET ONE OF YOUR CONCERNS
I WOULD HAVE PREFERED THE INLINE EXCEPT TO BE ACCEPTED

FOO EXCEPT ATTRIBUTEERROR DEFAULT

IT EASIER TO READ FEELS MORE LIKE PYTHON AND HAS A BIGGER LIST OF USE CASES

ESPECIALLY WE REJECTED THE CLASSICAL FOO BAR ELSE TERNARY SYNTAX IN FAVOR OF KEYWORD I REALLY DISLADE THE WHOLE INVASION
PYTHON STANDS OUT FOR HAVING SUCH CLEAR READABLE SYNTAX I THINK THE SYNTAX THIS PEP INTRODUCES WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO THE LANGUAGE

I WOULD PREFER TO SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO BETATTER WHICH ACCEPTS AN ITERABLE OF ATDRS AND RECURSIVELY LOOKS THEM UP I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS ALREADY IN THE THAT ALL DEVELOPERS COLLECT OVER TIME AND I'M AWARE OF AT LEAST ONE PROJECT OUT THERE THAT DOES SOMETHING SIMILAR
WHILE NOT THE MAIN FOCUS IS REALLY NICE HOWEVER I CAN'T SEE THAT MAKING IT IN NOT REALLY OBVIOUS WHICH SIDE IT TWEAKS ON BUT STILL COOL

IT'LL BE NICE TO FINALLY JOIN A BUNCH OF OTHER LANGUAGES IN HAVING THIS FEATURE

I KINDA WISH THAT EXISTENCE WOULD ALSO MEAN ACTUAL EXISTENCE IS CONSIDERED BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE

IT WOULD BE NICE TO GO FROM

TRY

EXCEPT NAMEERROR


TO



SO FOR EVERY PERSISTENT VARIABLE THAT IS GOING TO BE EXTRA LINES

WHY FOR MODULE RELOADS OF COURSE
FOR THOSE WORKING ON DATA PIPELINES WHICH OFTEN INCLUDE SPARSE DATA OR EVEN MISSING DATA THIS PEP WOULD BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT

I'M CONVINCED ABOUT THE SYNTAX BECAUSE IT CONSISTS OF A SINGLE CHARACTER THERE'S A RISK OF MISSING IT WHEN READING
THIS PEP INTRODUCES WHAT PYTHON TRIES TO AVOID SYNTAX FULL OF MAGICAL SYMBOLS IT IS NOT A GOOD THING
COOL FEATURE UGLY SYNTAX
STATUS DRAFT

NOTHING TO SEE HERE
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS

EXPLICIT IS BETTER THAN IMPLICIT
SPARSE IS BETTER THAN DENSE
READABILITY COUNTS
THERE SHOULD BE ONE AND PREFERABLY ONLY ONE OBVIOUS WAY TO DO IT

ACCEPTING THIS PEP WOULD SERVE TO MAKE PYTHON MORE LIKE PERL AND LESS LIKE PYTHON

BUT I GUESS THE MULTIPLE METHODS OF STRING FORMATTING ALL GOT ACCEPTED SO I MIGHT BE IN A MINORITY
REASONABLE IDEA BUT I DON'T LIKE THE SYNTAX IF WE GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE THAN IF HASATTR X Y Y NOT WORSE
SURPRISED AT THE NEGATIVE REACTIONS THIS LOOKS INCREDIBLE TO ME IT'S THE MAYBE MONAD IN A SINGLE CHARACTER
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE WITH OVERRIDING ON A CLASS WHERE THIS IS A COMMON USE CASE OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE CLASS REPRESENTATION OF THE OBJECT BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH OVERHEAD
DO WANT
I LOVE THE IDEA BUT ELSE IS OOOO UGLY HAVING SAID THAT I DON'T THINK ANY LANGUAGE HAS A GOOD OPERATOR STRING FOR THIS FEATURE
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE WHOLE EXISTENCE THING AND THE FACT THAT WE WOULD HAVE OPERATORS THAT SUPPORT THE USE OF NONE INSTEAD OF EXCEPTIONS FOR INDICATING ERRORS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EXCEPTIONS ALREADY WORK VERY WELL FOR THIS FOR EXAMPLE DOING RETURN FOO BAR BAZ IS REALLY JUST A WAY OF PROPAGATING A NONE

MIGHT BE NICE FOR DEALING WITH FUNCTION DEFAULTS OF NONE BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED IT IS REALLY WORTH IT
I REALLY LIKE THIS IT SEEMS VERY SIMILAR TO THE NULL PROPAGATION AND NULL COALESCING FEATURES OF C WHICH ARE SOME OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF THAT LANGUAGE JUST THE OPERATOR IN PARTICULAR WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE
IT'LL BE AN IMPROVEMENT BUT WE'LL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCE OF BEING ABLE TO LESS OFTEN SAY PYTHON IS READABLE
WHY NOT JUST EXPAND THE EXISTING OPERATOR TO DO THIS

VAR VAR 2 OR

OR JUST ADD THE DECORATOR TO IT TO MAKE IT CHECK SUPPRESS NON-EXISTENCE

VAR VAR 2 OR

I PERSONALLY LIKE THE LOOK OF THE FIRST BUT DON'T LIKE HOW IT CAN SUPPRESS FLAWS IN THE LOGIC OF THE PROGRAM

IN THE END IT SEEMS LIKE A HAM-FISTED WAY TO GLAZE OVER INCONSISTENCIES IN THE LOGIC OF A PROGRAM

IF THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO YOU SHOULD HAVE TO WRITE A BIGGER CONSTRUCT


FROM CONTEXTLIB IMPORT SUPPRESS

THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MY MIND WAS THE FORREST GUMP QUOTE RUN FORREST RUN BUT THAT'S JUST A GUESS
I THINK IT'S A METAL GEAR SOLID REFERENCE
THE JOKE IS THEIR X COMPATIBILITY THE LAST UPDATE OF THIS PROJECT IN PEPI IS
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A REFERENCE TO COMIC BOOK GUYS C DOS RUN RUN DOS RUN T-SHIRT IN THE SIMPSONS

WATCH V
SOUNDS LIKE A SCARY MOVIE OR FORREST GUMP REFERENCE

WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR LAST WORDS TO THE MURDERVICTIM

RUN BITCH RUN

OR MAYBE IT'S A JOKE ABOUT THE CLASSIC SNAKE GAMES
I FEEL LIKE YOU'LL ENJOY MIXING IN RUBY OR SCOPED TRAITS IN SCALA RUST BUILTIN CLASSES REALLY ISN'T SOMETHING YOU SHOULD BE DOING IN PYTHON
WE CAN ALREADY EXTEND BUILT-IN TYPES LIKE STRING

CLASS EYESTRING STR
DEF MYMETHOD SELF



THERE EYESTRING EXTENDS STR AS REQUESTED

WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WRITING A THAT LETS YOU PRETEND TO HAVE BUILT-IN TYPES BUT WITHOUT ACTUALLY THEM WHY BOTHER JUST WRITE A FUNCTION AND BE DONE WITH IT RATHER THAN PRETENDING TO BE WRITING
ANY PLANS FOR ADDING AUTOMATIC JAVASCRIPT FORM VALIDATION
AWESOME
NICE BUT

I USE PYRAMID QUITE A LOT AND THE SAME THING GOES FOR AT WORK BUT WE NEVER REALLY WENT WITH DEFORM BECAUSE IT SEEMED IT WAS VERY TIGHTLY INTEGRATED WITH COLANDER

I ENDED UP GOING WITH PYRAMID WTFORMS JINJA 2 WHICH GIVES A VERY FEEL AND I'VE COME TO QUITE LIKE THIS STACK

ONE OF THE REASONS OUR TEAM AT WORK ENDED UP REALLY DISLIKING COLANDER IS BECAUSE AT LEAST IF YOU USE IT FOR API SCHEMAS IT SERIALIZES FIELDS VERY BADLY TO JASON AND EVERYTHING JUST BECOMES A STRING WHICH IS NOT REALLY WHAT YOU WANT FOR ANTS AND BOILS FOR EXAMPLE I ALSO FOUND COLANDER SCHEMA CLASSES TO BE A BIT MORE VERBOSE THAN MARSHMALLOW BECAUSE EVERY FIELD IS WRAPPED IN A SCHEMANODE TYPE WHILE MARSHMALLOW DOESN'T REALLY NEED THIS

ONCE AGAIN I DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT DEFORM AND IF YOU CAN EVEN USE IT WITH MARSHMALLOW INSTEAD OF COLANDER OR IF THAT EVEN MAKES SENSE

COLANDER CAN BE FIXED BY SUBCLASSING EVERY FIELD BUT THIS IS A BIT ANNOYING AND I REALLY HOPE THEY FIX SERIALIZATION TO JASON

PYLONS COLANDER ISSUES
HOW DO YOU DYNAMICALLY SHOW HIDE A FORM INPUT
IF YOU'RE STILL NOT SURE HOW TO DEVELOP THE ACTUAL GUI APPLICATION WHY COMPLICATE IT EVEN FURTHER BY WANTING TO CREATE A SYSTEM RIGHT FROM THE START ALREADY
I SUGGEST CREATING SOMETHING THAT AT FIRST STORES STUFF INSIDE A LOCAL SALITE DATABASE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU MAKE SURE YOUR DATA ACCESS IS DONE IN CODE THAT IS CLEARLY SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE APPLICATION IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT HARD TO MODIFY IT LATER ON TO STORE IT SOMEWHERE ON A SERVER
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON
ISN'T IT MORE FUN TO WRITE IT ALL YOURSELF
I SECOND IT
IN FACT ONE OF MY MSC STUDENTS TOOK THIS COURSE LAST YEAR AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY GOOD ONE
VERY GOOD COURSE COVERS A GOOD RANGE OF SUBJECTS TOOK THIS COURSE WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW COURSES I TOOK BEFORE GOING TO COLLEGE AND I WILL SAY IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE BEST OUT THERE

JUST COMPLETE WEEK THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP AMAZING COURSE

I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER SEE THE DAY WAY TO GO MARAVI TEAM IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE AN EFFORT TO PORT TO PYTHON
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE SO I GOT CONFUSED FOR A MOMENT WHEN TRYING TO SEE HOW THIS WAS RELATED TO AUTODESK MAYA AND VIM

ANYWAY LOOKS LIKE A COOL PROJECT
FOR ALL NON HINDI SPEAKING FELLAS OUT THERE MARAVI MEANS MAGICAL IN HINDI
I WONDER HOW THIS COMPARES TO PLATLY THE TIME SERIES STUFF LOOKS SUPER HELPFUL THOUGH
FOR 3D VISUALIZATION I USE ATK AND PARAVIEW AS THE BLOG SAYS MARAVI PROVIDES A CONVENIENT PYTHONIC WRAPPER FOR THE POWERFUL ATK VISUALIZATION TOOLKIT LIBRARY WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF USING MARAVI OVER THE ATK LIBRARY ITSELF
THERE ARE ALSO PLATLY PYTHREEJS SAGE 3D PLOTS AND VISBY WORTH MENTIONING BUT MATPLOTLIB WITH EPLOT 3D WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY 3D PLOTS ESPECIALLY SINCE I DO MATPLOTLIB PANDAS MOSTLY

WE NEED ALTAIR FOR 3D PLOTS

ALTAIR
FOR 3D VISUALIZATION I USED ATK AND PARAVIEW IN THE PAST BUT I THINK I AM GOING TO USE MARAVI 3D FROM NOW ON IT SEEMS MUCH MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD
IT SAYS IT REQUIRES AUTHENTICATION I CAN'T ACCESS THE WEBSITE AS IT'S BLOCKED BY MY ESP BUT LOOK INTO HOW THEIR AUTHENTICATION WORKS ALSO PLEASE POST YOUR OTHER QUESTIONS IN R LEARNPYTHON

AWESOME I HAVE BEEN PLANNING ON DOING A SERIES ON BUILDING A SELF DRIVING TOY CAR AS A COMBINATION OF A BUNCH OF MY TUTORIAL SERIES

ARE YOU THE CREATOR OF THIS

IF SO WHY DID YOU USE THE PAPER AS OPPOSED TO BUILDING A MODEL IN UNITY OR EVEN PREGAME OR EVEN JUST IN PURE DATA FOR THAT MATTER WOULD BE A WHOLE HELL OF A LOT FASTER TO TRAIN IT TO DO THINGS THAT'S WHAT I WAS PLANNING TO DO ANYWAY
HERE IS THE GIT REPO


I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DO SUCH A THING THANKS
WATCHED IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND LEARNT SOME NEW STUFF CHEERS
AS A SECOND YEAR STUDENT IN COMPUTER ENGINEERING HOW MIGHT I GO ABOUT RECREATING SOMETHING SIMILAR I'VE WANTED TO PLAY AROUND WITH A RASPBERRY PI FOR A WHILE AND I WANT TO LEARN OPENCUT SO THIS SOUNDS SO COOL
IS THERE A LIVE DEMO ANYWHERE
BRAIN SKIPPED THE WORD TOY I WAS ABOUT TO START RAGING ABOUT HOW IRRESPONSIBLE A DIY AUTONOMOUS CAR WOULD BE
WHY DO YOU WANT TO TRANSITION TO VISUAL STUDIO IN MY EXPERIENCE PYCHARM IS WAY BETTER FOR PYTHON
WELL MOST OF THE REASONS WHY PYTHON IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR DATA SCIENCE ARE ABOUT THE SAME AS WHY PYTHON IS A GOOD CHOICE IN GENERAL SIMPLE EASY TO LEARN HIGHLY READABLE GOOD LIBRARIES

BUT FOR DATA SCIENCE IN PARTICULAR YOU HAVE GOOD ADROOP INTERFACES MOST DATA SCIENTISTS RELY ON ADROOP YOU CAN EASILY DO MAP REDUCE TYPE OPERATIONS IN PYTHON THOUGH NOT AS EASILY AS IN SAY GO AND YOU GET BUMPY SNIPY AND OTHER MATHTASTIC LIBRARIES
NETWORK EFFECT THE MAIN REASON IT IS USED FOR DATA SCIENCE IS BECAUSE EVERYONE USES IT FOR DATA SCIENCE AS SUCH IT HAS A MASSIVE ECOSYSTEM FOR DATA SCIENCE WITH THE MOST COMPLETE LIBRARIES TRAINING AND DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS USE CASE THE LANGUAGE ITSELF IS PRETTY NO NONSENSE AND EASY TO PICK UP WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY TOOK A HOLD TO START WITH
IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER ANSWERS I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD STRAIGHTFORWARD INTEGRATION WITH OLD C AND FORTRAN CODE IF I RECALL CORRECTLY A LOT OF THE EARLY SCIENTIFIC PYTHON LIKE SNIPY WERE EFFECTIVELY JUST WRAPPERS AROUND OLD FORTRAN LIBRARIES

EVEN TODAY I THINK PYTHON STILL HAS ONE OF THE BEST STORIES FOR C INTEGRATION BECAUSE OF COTHON I'VE DON'T THINK I'VE EVER HEARD OF A COTHON EQUIVALENT FOR ANY OTHER MAINSTREAM LANGUAGE
PYTHON SYNTAX IS EASY CLEAR I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW NICE IT IS FOR ALL PYTHON CODE TO LOOK PRETTY CLOSE TO THE SAME

THERE ARE A TON OF LIBRARIES LIBRARIES ARE FREE UNLIKE MATALAN THEY'RE WELL DEVELOPED AND HIGHLY INTEGRATED UNLIKE R MANY LIBRARIES SUPPORT RDF WHICH ALLOWS FOR HUGE DATA ARRAYS TO BE PROCESSED DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD LIBRARIES ARE EASY TO INSTALL UNLIKE C BECAUSE RARELY DO YOU HAVE TO BUILD THEM

NOT SURE WHY ANYBODY WOULD USE PHS OR RUBY OR JAVASCRIPT FOR NUMERICAL COMPUTATIONS THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DISASTER STILL THAT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAN PERL WITHOUT NO STRICT WHICH IS WHAT I USED TO USE
I WOULD SAY R IS BETTER FOR DATA SCIENCE BUT PYTHON IS IN ADDITION REALLY GOOD AT GENERAL PURPOSE PROGRAMMING SO PYTHON WINS OVERALL
LIBRARIES SNIPY AND BUMPY PAVED THE WAY AND PANDAS AND WHATEVER ELSE BUILT FROM THAT NICE REPL ESP WITH INTERACTIVE NOTEBOOKS EASY SYNTAX COMPARED TO SAY JAVA THAT REQUIRES A FAIR AMOUNT OF COMP SCI KNOWLEDGE OR R THAT TENDS TO BE DIFFICULT FOR NON MATHS PEOPLE FAST ENOUGH GENERALLY ALL THAT LED TO A STRONG NETWORK EFFECT
A FEW REASONS

AS OTHERS MENTIONED THE SUITE OF AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES IS FANTASTIC
PERFORMANCE IS GENERALLY QUITE GOOD ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S PRETTY EASY TO WRITE FAST C LIBRARIES WITH PYTHON INTERFACES
IT'S EASY TO SCALE A LOT OF DATA SCIENCE PROBLEMS ARE EMBARRASSINGLY PARALLEL IT'S REALLY EASY TO DO MULTIPROCESSING IN PYTHON OR USE GNU PARALLEL OR WHATEVER
THE MOST IMPORTANT BIT DEALING WITH DATA IS REALLY EASY READING WRITING TEXT DATA IS INCREDIBLY EASY WITH PYTHON SQL IS EASY OF THE TIME SPENT DOING DATA SCIENCE IS JUST SPENT BUNGING DATA AND IF YOU CAN DRAMATICALLY LOWER THE BARRIER THERE LIKE PYTHON HAS THEN YOU'VE GOT A WINNER
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT PYTHON ITSELF THAT MAKES IT WELL SUITED TO DATA SCIENCE IT'S THE LIBRARIES LIKE BUMPY SNIPY PANDAS ETC WHICH ARE VERY NICE THE REASON THE AUTHORS OF THOSE LIBRARIES CHOSE TO USE PYTHON AS THE SCRIPTING INTERFACE IS BECAUSE PYTHON IS A VERY NICE SCRIPTING LANGUAGE CLEAN EXPRESSIVE SYNTAX AND A GOOD COMMUNITY
IT HAS REALLY GREAT LIBRARIES FOR DATA SCIENCE AND GOOD COMMUNITY SUPPORT YOU GET

JUPITER NOTEBOOKS
SNIPY
PANDAS
BUMPY
SCHILIT LEARN FOR MACHINE LEARNING
DATA VIZ MATPLOTLIB SEABORN BOKE PLATLY ETC

AND MOST MAJOR BIG DATA LIBRARIES HAVE A PYTHON API SUCH AS SPARK

A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE PREFER OR SUGGEST R WHICH IS ALSO A GREAT LANGUAGE BUT PYTHON IS ALSO A GREAT CHOICE BECAUSE IT IS A GENERAL LANGUAGE AND YOU CAN APPLY YOUR SKILLS IN PYTHON TO MULTIPLE FIELDS USING OTHER LIBRARIES
AS EVERYONE ELSE HAS MENTIONED PYTHON HAS GREAT LIBRARIES EASY TO LEARN SYNTAX AND INTERCOMS WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING WHAT MAKES ALL THIS POSSIBLE IN MY OPINION ANYWAY IS THAT PYTHON HAS DUCK TYPING NOT HAVING TO SPECIFY COMPLEX DATA TYPES MAKES IT INCREDIBLY EASY TO WORK WITH IF YOU HAVE A FUNCTION THAT CAN WORK ON A CERTAIN SUBSET OF INSTANCES BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A MULTIINDEX OR JUST A NORMAL INDEX OR IF SOME COLUMNS ARE BOOLEANS OR INTEGERS THEN WRITING THAT FUNCTION IS A LOT EASIER HAVING TO WORK WITH INCREDIBLY COMPLEX TYPES BECOMES A HUGE CHORE IN LANGUAGES THAT CHOOSE TO GO THAT ROUTE I'M NOT SAYING IT'S BAD BUT IT'S NOT CONDUCIVE TO FAST ITERATION THE TYPES MAKE IT MORE CORRECT BUT VERY FREQUENTLY IN THE DATA SCIENCE AND DATA PROCESSING WORLD YOU DON'T NEED ABSOLUTE CORRECTNESS YOU NEED FLEXIBILITY DUCK TYPING MEANS THAT 3RD PARTY LIBRARIES CAN ACCEPT YOUR OBJECTS AND YOUR APIS CAN ACCEPT OBJECTS FROM YOUR CODE OR 3RD PARTY LIBRARIES WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT THIS MAKES LIBRARIES MUCH MORE
THE SYNTAX IS SIMPLE IT'S EASY TO LEARN AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF LIBRARIES
THE ANSWER IS DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT USE CASES IN MINE I CONTROL MY PHYSICAL ELECTRONIC HARDWARE WITH PYTHON AND IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO ANALYZE THE DATA REAL-TIME IN THE SAME LANGUAGE WITHOUT HAVING TO PACKAGE UNPACK MANIPULATE AND WHATNOT MULTIPLE TIMES I GENERATE LESS DATA THIS WAY BUT THE DATA I STORE IS ENTIRELY MEANINGFUL
WHATEVER THE REASON THE INTEREST IN PYTHON FOR THESE USES IS VERY OLD

PIPERMAIL AUGUST

MY GUESS IS THIS PEOPLE WERE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES TO COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS PARTICULARLY MATALAN PYTHON WAS AN ELEGANT LANGUAGE WITH AN INTERACTIVE INTERPRETER THEY ONLY NEEDED TO ADD A PROPER ARRAY DATA TYPE GUIDO WAS AN EARLY SUPPORTER OF THIS USE CASE AND ADDED THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL SLICING SYNTAX AND ELLIPSIS

THE REST IS HISTORY
WHY WOULD ONE WANT TO USE A CLOSURE RATHER THAN A CLASS
SAYING PYTHON IMPLIES THAT IT CAME OUT IN PYTHON
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OTHERS BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LOVE JUPITER IT OBVIOUSLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU DO AND FOR VISUALIZATION IT'S PRETTY GOOD BUT I'D LEAVE IT MOST OF THE TIME
DATA ANALYST HERE I USE JUPITER NOTEBOOKS MOST DAYS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE WORK I DO IS IN PREPARING REPORTS OR ANALYSES FOR WHICH THEY'RE A NATURAL CHOICE IT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE TO DO ANY REPORTING WORK OR EVEN MORE EXPLORATORY STUFF IN NOTEBOOKS

WHAT I TEND TO DO WHEN STUDYING SOMETHING NEW SOFTWARE OR IS MAKE A FEW NOTEBOOKS AS I FUCK ABOUT AND GET CLOSER TO WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO THEN EVENTUALLY MOVE THE BIGGER MOVING PARTS OF THAT OUT INTO MODULES WHICH I CALL FROM THE NOTEBOOKS


WHEN YOU NEED TO WRITE A PROGRAM CONSISTING OF MORE THAN JUST ONE LINEAR FLOW THERE'S NO REAL NEED FOR NOTEBOOKS WORKING IN A PLAIN OLD IDE TEXT EDITOR IS FINE AND MAYBE IT'LL EVEN HELP YOU ORGANISE STUFF BETTER
IT FILLS A NICHE IN THE SAME WAY I USE PYTHON TUTOR FOR CODE VISUALISATION BUT SOME FEATURES I FALL BACK INTO PYCHARM


JUPITER NOTEBOOKS ARE GREAT TO TELL A STORY OR EXPLORE DATA AD VISUALIZE IT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PRODUCTION YOU'LL NEED TO EVENTUALLY HAVE A PY FILE AND MOST LIKELY YOUR OWN MODULES IN WHICH CASE YOU'LL WANT TO GO TO A TEXT EDITOR LIKE SUBLIME ATOM OR A FULL IDE LIKE PYCHARM
AT WORK I FIND THE ONLY PEOPLE USING SNYDER PYTHON JUPITER ETC ARE PEOPLE COMING FROM A MATALAN BACKGROUND THEY USE IT BECAUSE IT FEELS MORE FAMILIAR

PEOPLE WITHOUT A MATALAN BACKGROUND TEND TO USE A TEXT EDITOR OR IDE RUNNING THE PROGRAMS FROM THE COMMAND PROMPT I ALSO TEND TO KEEP AN INTERPRETER UP AND RUNNING JUST TO TEST LINES OF CODE

GREAT FOR ANALYSIS BUT I USE MISCODE FOR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
I LIKE A MIX REAL DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS IN SUBLIME TEXT VISUALIZATIONS TUTORIALS AND THE LIKE HAPPEN IN NOTEBOOKS OFTEN SUPPORTED BY LIBRARIES NOT TOO LONG AGO I WROTE A FAIRLY LARGE DATA PROCESSING PIPELINE THAT RAN THROUGH SEVERAL GIGS OF DATA PRODUCED SOME EXCEL REPORTS AND GENERATED SOME NOTEBOOKS FOR INTERACTIVE ANALYSIS I LEVERAGED IPYWIDGETS TO MAKE THE USABILITY MUCH BETTER AND RAN EVERYTHING ON A CENTRAL SERVER SO I COULD SHARE IT EASILY TURNED OUT GREAT BUT THE COUPLE THOUSAND LINES OF CODE WRITTEN TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE WERE PRIMARILY WRITTEN IN SUBLIME AND TESTED FROM THE COMMAND LINE
I GENERALLY EXPLORE CODE AND POKE AROUND USING PYTHON AND JUPITER ONCE I FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT TO WRITE I MOVE MY CODE TO THE TEXT EDITOR
I WOULD RATHER USE A TEXT EDITOR LIKE SUBLIME BUT THAT'S JUST ME
I PERSONALLY USE IT FOR ANY DATA ANALYSIS WHICH IS MORE THAN A FEW STEPS IT'S JUST SO CONVENIENT TO HAVE THE DATA RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AS YOU WORK WITH IT RATHER THAN RELOADING THE DATA TO MEMORY EVERY TIME YOU RUN ANOTHER ITERATION OF THE SCRIPTURE

I ALSO USE JUPITER NOTEBOOKS WHEN I'M UNFAMILIAR WITH AN API AND WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT I DEFINITELY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE INVESTIGATING WITH NOTEBOOKS I WILL SAY MY OUTPUT IS PROBABLY A LITTLE FASTER WITH STANDARD CODE EDITORS WHEN I'M FAMILIAR WITH AN API THOUGH
BOKE
PERHAPS
MDBTOOLS CAN PARSE AT LEAST SOME ADB FILES I'VE USED IT TO EXTRACT DATA IN THE PAST I DON'T KNOW OF A PYTHON WRAPPER THOUGH AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT COMPILES ON WINDOWS
LOOK FOR SOMETHING CALLED ADOD FOR PYTHON



PYTHON ADO
I JUST BOOTED UP AN XP PRO VM THAT HAS VERY LITTLE INSTALLED ON IT AND IT HAS THE ACCESS ADB ODAC DRIVER SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S INSTALLED BY DEFAULT

UNLESS YOU'RE RUNNING XP HOME ON THESE MACHINES AND THAT DOESN'T HAVE THEM INSTALLED I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER SOLUTION
LOOK AT THE MULTIPROCESSING MODULE
YOU MAY WANT TO USE SUBPROCESSING IN ORDER TO SPAWN A CHILD PROCESS IF THE SCRIPTS ARE EXECUTABLE THEY OUGHT TO SPAWN THEIR OWN PYTHON PROCESS AS A CHILD OF YOUR GUI
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO USE THE CODE MODULE IT WILL LET YOU DROP INTO AN INTERACTIVE PROMPT AFTER RUNNING OR IMPORTING A MODULE

LIBRARY
IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT BELONGS IN R LEARNPYTHON ON R PYTHON THEN HIT THAT REPORT BUTTON AND SELECT BELONGS IN R LEARNPYTHON IT'LL GET REMOVED WHENEVER I GET TO THE MODQUEUE I TRY TO DO THIS DAILY REMOVING THINGS THAT ARE LEARNING QUESTIONS IS NOT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IN MY LIFE AND IT SHOULDN'T BE YOURS EITHER IF A POST LANGUISHES AT VOTES AND IS ANSWERED AND THEN REMOVED HOURS LATER WHO DOES IT HURT

IF YOU THINK SOMETHING ISN'T APPROPRIATE FOR R PYTHON THEN DOWNVOTE IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE IT THEN SET REDDIN TO HIDE POSTS THAT YOU HAVE DOWNVOTED

THE MODERATION POLICY HERE IS THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF MODERATION POSSIBLE WE SHOULD ALL BE REASONABLE ADULTS AND VOTE UP THE THINGS THAT ARE GOOD AND VOTE DOWN THE THINGS THAT ARE BAD IF SOMETHING WITH ONLY A FEW VOTES IS ON THE FRONT OF R PYTHON THEN THAT MEANS THAT WE DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH CONTENT AND MAYBE INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING YOU SHOULD SUBMIT SOMETHING AMAZING

NEWS DOES NOT FLOW VERY FAST IN THE PYTHON WORLD WE DON'T GET THOUSANDS OF AMAZING SUBMISSIONS EVERY DAY LEARNING POSTS ARE NOT PREVENTING GREAT CONTENT FROM REACHING THE HOT SECTION WE JUST DON'T HAVE LOTS OF CONTENT WHICH IS THE PROBLEM
YES MODERATION MUST BE BAD WITH USELESS POSTS LIKE THIS GETTING THROUGH
THE MOBILE SITE OR APP DOES NOT SHOW THE SIDEBAR

2 MOBILES NOW REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF INTERNET USAGE

SCHOOL TERM TIMETABLES
IF I SEE A POST THAT SHOULD NOT BE HERE I JUST DOWN VOTE IT WHAT THE CURRENT TREND TELLS ME IS THAT WE NOW HAVE MORE BEGINNERS COMING TO R PYTHON
MAYBE I DON'T NOTICE IT AS MUCH SINCE I ALSO READ R MATALAN AND THAT IS TRULY PAINFUL WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT MINUTES OF THOUGHT OR 2 OF GOOGLING WOULD HELP FIX

OR MAYBE IT IS A SIGN OF PYTHON BECOMING A LANGUAGE AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE USING IT
R PYTHON IS INTENTIONALLY CATCH-ALL TO A DEGREE SANS LEARNING QUESTIONS

MODERATION ONLY WORKS WHEN PEOPLE ARE AWAKE AND NOT BUSY USUALLY

R LEARNPYTHON IS OBVIOUS

R PYTHONCODING WHICH I NOW RUN IS FOR CONTENT BUT WITHOUT THE BEGINNER STUFF BUT LACKS CONTENT
FLASK
AUTOBAHN IS ANOTHER OPTION BUILT ON TOP OF TWISTED I HAVE STARTED USING IT BUT HAVEN'T FULLY EXPLORED THE FEATURES OR PERFORMANCE SO I HAVE NO COMPARISON INFORMATION FOR YOU BUT IT WAS DEAD SIMPLE TO USE WITH TWISTED
I LIKE PERSONALLY AND WE USE

THAT BEING SAID IF YOU JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING SIMPLE YOU CAN JUST DO TO SEND FROM SERVER CLIENT AND THEN USE NORMAL AJAX CALLS FROM CLIENT SERVER

EDIT IS NICE BECAUSE IT WORKS ALSO AS A FALLBACK IF WEBSOCKETS AREN'T POSSIBLE VIA POLLING AND ALSO IT ON DISCONNECTION IF THERE'S A NETWORK HICCUP
IF YOU WANT EASE OF USE I'D PROBABLY GO WITH YOU DON'T MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR SCALE BUT IT SUPPORTS A BROKER AMAP OR CEDIS SO IF YOU NEED MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF YOUR APPLICATION TO SUPPORT YOUR USERS THEY'LL ALL GET THE EVENT

THERE ARE A FEW OTHER OPTIONS PRIMARILY IN THE ASYNC WORLD AIOHTTP HAS RAW WEBSOCKETS OR A SOCKS EXTENSION THERE IS ALSO JUST THE WEBSOCKETS MODULE BUT IF YOU HAVE THE NEED FOR MULTIPLE INSTANCES RUNNING YOU'LL END UP WRITING MOST OF WHAT ALREADY GIVES YOU
TL R STRAIGHT FROM THE PYTHO DOCS THE MARSHAL MODULE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE SECURE AGAINST ERRONEOUS OR MALICIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED DATA NEVER UNMARSHALED DATA RECEIVED FROM AN UNTRUSTED OR UNAUTHENTICATED SOURCE


TRY R FORHAILE OR MAYBE R LEARNPYTHON
DO KINDLY READ THE SIDE BAR INFO FAQ FOR BOTH R PYTHON R LEARNPYTHON
REALLY HELPED ME LEARN PYTHON IT TEACHES YOU PARTS OF PYTHON AND THEN MAKES YOU DO CHALLENGES USING THAT KNOWLEDGE
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE COMING FROM A LANGUAGE LIKE RUBY OR C WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO OPEN THE BUILT-IN CLASSES AND EXTEND THEM AS A PERSON WHO WRITES MOST OF HIS CODE IN PYTHON I CAN SEE THE NOVELTY OF THE IDEA BUT ULTIMATELY THINK IT WOULD BE MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH I WOULD MUCH RATHER SEE AN IPADDRESS CLASS INHERITING STR THAN ALL OF THE SUDDEN HAVE ALL STRINGS ACT LIKE IP ADDRESSES

SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WRITING STRINGS THAT ARE PRETTY BASIC AND AN INHERITED CLASS WON'T DO THE RIGHT THING IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE THE WAY STRING WOULD

I SUSPECT THAT IN THESE CASES THERE MIGHT BE SIMPLE PYTHONIC SOLUTIONS COULD YOU PROVIDE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE

THE QUESTION YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF IS DOES THIS CHANGE MAKE SENSE TO EVERY STRING IN MY PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES ONES COMING FROM OTHER LIBRARIES AND GOING INTO OTHER LIBRARIES

FOR YOUR IP EXAMPLE THE ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING NUMBER IF SOMEONE ASKED THIS WITH COMMONEY THE ANSWER WOULD ALSO BE NUMBER

I SUPPOSE YOUR QUESTION COULD ALSO BE PHRASED CAN PYTHON AUTO CONVERT TYPES ALA SCALA OR JAVASCRIPT THE ANSWER IS ALSO NO AND NOR SHOULD IT AS IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING IN PYTHON EXPLICIT IS BETTER THAN IMPLICIT BUT THERE'S ALSO THE FACT THAT TYPES ARE DUCKS RATHER THAN AN ACTUAL ENFORCEMENT LIKE SCALA AND THERE'S NO SPECIAL PRIMITIVES LIKE IN JAVASCRIPT YOU COULD ARGUE THAT HAVE LITERALS MAKES THEN SPECIAL BUT THEY PRODUCE THE SAME THING AS CALLING THE CONSTRUCTOR UNLIKE JAVASCRIPT WHICH DOES TEMPORARY ON BOOLEAN NUMBER AND STRING

RATHER WHAT YOU SHOULD BE ASKING YOURSELF IS WHAT DO I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH HERE IF THE ANSWER IS PARSING AN IP ADDRESS THERE'S IPADDRESS IN AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A BACKWORT AS WELL BUT I'VE NOT USED IT

AS FOR WHY YOU CAN'T JUST MONKEYPATCH BUILTIN TYPES IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE BUILT IN C AND HAVE SPECIAL LIMITATIONS PLACED ON THEM THERE NEEDS TO BE SPECIAL FOR WRITTEN TO ALLOW THEM TO BE SUBCLASSED IN PYTHON EVEN ADAIR FUNCTION AND BOOL NEVER HAD THIS WRITTEN SO I CAN'T IMPLEMENT FILENOTFOUND AS A MEMBER OF BOOL BOO BUT YOU CAN MONKEYPATCH THESE TYPES BY GOING THROUGH THE C API AND TOUCHING THEM DIRECTLY
I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU ARE GOING TO FIND A RELIABLE LIBRARY OR ALTERNATIVE PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION THAT LETS YOU DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK TO PROVIDE SOME FUNCTIONALITY THAT IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AND BARELY USEFUL YOU CAN ALREADY ALL MANNER OF CLASSES IN THE STANDARD LIBRARY THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED IN PYTHON BUT PEOPLE RARELY DO IT BECAUSE IT CAUSES CONFUSION AND MIGHT CREATE INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S CODE OR FUTURE PYTHON VERSIONS

HAVING SAID THAT I FOUND THIS BUT IT'S A MESS AND CLEARLY RELIES ON PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS I DON'T KNOW MY WAY AROUND THE C API SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS ANY WARTS OR IS LIKELY TO WORK IN FUTURE VERSIONS IT SEEMS TO WORK IN PYTHON IF YOU FIX THE PRINT STATEMENT AND REPLACE DICTPROXYTYPE WITH MAPPINGPROXYTYPE

DOTHINGTODOTTEDQUAD

I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS BETTER THAN DOTHINGTODOTTEDQUAD I KNOW RUBY LETS YOU DO THIS KIND OF THING BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF IT MOST ARTICLES I CAN FIND ABOUT MONKEY PATCHING IN RUBY ADVISE YOU TO TRY AND AVOID IT IF AT ALL POSSIBLE

DOOTHERTHINGTHATEXPECTSSTRING STR THING

MOST FUNCTIONS THAT EXPECT A STR ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COPE WITH A SUBCLASS OF STR THAT MERELY ADDS A NEW METHOD SO COERCING BACK TO STR IS PROBABLY UNNECESSARY IN MOST CASES
SORRY I'M JUST ANOTHER JERK WHO THINKS YOU SHOULD INHERIT FROM STR AND DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS FOR A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT THAT DOES THIS CHECK OUT PLUMBUM S PATH OR LOCALPATH CLASSICAL

FROM AWESOME IMPORT DOTTEDQUAD AS DQ

THING DQ
THING THING DOTHINGTOORWITHDOTTEDQUAD
DOOTHERTHINGTHATEXPECTSSTRING THING

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS

REREADING I SEE

AN INHERITED CLASS WON'T DO THE RIGHT THING IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE THE WAY STRING WOULD

AND I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM IF YOU WANT IT TO BE A STR DON'T WRITE IT IN A WAY THAT BREAKS STR SOUTH
QUESTION DOES YOUR CLASS PROVIDE A METHOD FOR REPRODUCING AS A STRING
TAKE A LOOK AT A FREE ONLINE BOOK HOW TO THINK LIKE A COMPUTER SCIENTIST THIS IS AN EXCELLENT FIRST PROGRAMMING AND PYTHON TUTORIAL
IT'S AN EXCELLENT TUTORIAL IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY FOR YOUR PREFERRED CAREER PATHOLOGY

NOTE THIS TYPE OF THING IS BEST SUBMITTED TO R LEARNPYTHON IT'S EXTREMELY ACTIVE THIS SUB IS MORE FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH PYTHON ALREADY


WORK YOUR WAY THRU THIS IT SHOULD GET YOU TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN READ WRITE VALUES TO FROM CSF EXCEL FILES NO PROBLEM
I THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW SOME DATA SCRAPING TO SCRAPE DATA OFF THE DATABASE SUGGESTED MODULES SCRAPY BEAUTIFUL SOUP

THEN YOU NEED ANOTHER MODULE TO WRITE THE DATA TO EXCEL FILES SUGGESTED MODULES BLOWINGS
IT BEST APPROACH DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE DATABASE IF IT IS AN DAP DATABASE YOU CAN PROBABLY DUMP THE DATABASE DIRECTLY SINCE IT IS A LOCAL DATABASE AND YOU ARE PRESUMABLY AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION YOU COULD ALSO ASK THE APPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATOR TO DUMP A FEW COLUMNS FROM THE MASTER DATABASE AND GIVE IT TO YOU IN A FILE AUTOMATING DATABASE LOOKUPS WILL GET YOU A LITTLE FARTHER BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE A COPY OF A DATABASE ROW BY ROW VIA AN API AND THERE ARE MANY FASTER APPROACHES TO COPY A DATABASE
I HAD TO LEAVE EARLY AND MISSED THE LIGHTNING TALKS SO I WAS HOPING THEY WOULD BE POSTED AS WELL BUT I DON'T SEE THEM ANY CHANCE THEY'LL BE SHOWING UP AT SOME POINT
GOD I WISH I COULD MAKE NICE CHARTS AND GRAPHS FROM MY SPREADSHEET DATA UGH ALWAYS TURNS OUT CRAPPY FOR ME
LOOK AT THIS
IT IS A GUI LIBRARY IN PURE PYTHON SUITABLE FOR LOCAL NETWORK WEBAPP
I'D RECOMMEND NOT DOING THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF YOUR TIME PUZZLING OVER A WEB FRAMEWORK JAVASCRIPT IS AN EASY LANGUAGE TO LEARN AND THE POPULAR FRAMEWORKS ARE WELL DOCUMENTED AND WIDELY USED
ON GAESTARTERKIT WHICH IS FLASK APPENGINE I HAD RELATIVELY GOOD LUCK WITH KIKWIT SINCE YOU ARE WRITING A WEB APP YOU DO NEED SOME JAVASCRIPT COFFEESCRIPT OR TYPESCRIPT CAN HELP KEEP YOU SANE BUT KIKWIT TAKES CARE OF MOST OF THE BASICS OF A WEB INTERFACE DATE TIME PICKERS PANELS ALL THAT

I WOULD ALSO FAVORABLY MENTION KENDOUI AS A OPTION
FLEX IS ONE I'M AWARE OF THOUGH I HAVEN'T TRIED TO USE IT
IN THE END YOU'RE JUST GOING TO GET A LIBRARY THAT WRITES OUT TO HEML JAVASCRIPT

YOU MIGHT AS WELL AS JUST USE BOOTSTRAP AND SOMETHING LIKE FLASK DURANGO JINJA TO GENERATE THE HEML

IT'LL SCALE MUCH BETTER THAN ANY PYTHON LIBRARY THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS
I WOULD RATHER USE JAVASCRIPT FOR THESE TYPE OF THINGS
WATCH SOMEONE RUN GAMES ON WINE ON BSL AND GET BETTER PERFORMANCE XD
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOUR PIP INSTALL AFFINITY AT THE TOP OF THE SCRIPT SET THE PROCESS TO ONE CORE ONLY AND TIME IT AGAIN IT'S JUST ONE LINE OF CODE EXCLUDING THE IMPORT CURIOUS

I'VE ALSO NOTICED CONDA WORKING MUCH FASTER IN A VM ON WINDOWS THAN FROM THE CMD POWERSHELL
BOOB QUESTION WHY NOT USE DEATHTIME WHAT IS TH ENOINT OF THESE TOOLS
ANOTHER REASON ARROW IS REALLY SLOW ALTHOUGH THIS ARTICLE IMPLIES PENDULUM'S EVEN SLOWER
I VE STOPPED USING ARROW TOO AND AM BACK TO DEATHTIME
THE WAY THE REPLACE METHOD WORD IN ARROW IS VERY DANGEROUS AS EXPLAINED IN THE ARTICLE THE FACT THAT A SINGLE LETTER CHANGING AN ARGUMENT FROM HOUR TO HOURS HAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESULTS REPLACING THE HOUR COMPONENT OR SHIFTING IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE REALLY HARD TO FIND BUGS IT S COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAN VERY QUICK EXPLORATIONS

CURRENTLY I'M REMOVING ARROW FROM ALL MY PROJECTS HAVEN'T TRIED PENDULUM YET

IT'S STARTING TO FEEL LIKE A CRUSADE PENDULUM AUTHOR ON A QUEST TO BANISH ARROW
I'VE BEEN USING ARROW FOR A LONG TIME AND REACTED WITH SKEPTICISM WHEN PENDULUM WAS ANNOUNCED THEN THE AUTHOR STARTED TO ALMOST ATTACK ARROW AND I QUITE DISLIKED THE TONE OF IT

BUT IN THE END AND AFTER DOING SOME SIDE BY SITE COMPARISON I MUST ADMIN I WILL NOW USE PENDULUM THE API IS BETTER THE OMNIPOTENT GET AND NON STANDARD FORMAT LANGUAGE ARE MY PET DEAVES AND THE RESULTS ARE MORE ACCURATE I DON'T MIND THE PERFORMANCE

AND WHY AM I NOT USING

DEATHTIME BECAUSE IT LACKS FEATURE I WANT SUCH AS EASIER TIME SHIFTING HUMAN FORMATING BETTER TEXT PARSING AND TIMEZONE HANDLING
PUTZ IT'S INSTALLED WITH PENDULUM ANYWAY AND THE LATER BRING MORE THINGS TO THE TABLE
YOU MAY BE RIGHT BUT THE WAY THIS ARTICLE IS WRITTEN IS QUITE OFF PUTTING
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
GI
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE TIMESTAMPS THAT ARE SORTABLE AND UNAMBIGUOUS AND TO HAVE THAT I WOULD NEED SOMETHING LIKE TAI GPS OR TIME BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AFFECTED BY LEAP SECONDS LIKE EVERY UTC BASED TIMEZONE OR THE UNIX TIME

IS THAT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE WITH PENDULUM OR SOME OTHER TIME LIBRARY
I COULDN'T HELP WONDER WHY IT NAMED ARROW PENDULUM MAKES SENSES FOR A TIME LIBRARY AT LEAST
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF NASA APOD USING
IN GENERAL PYTHON THREADS ONLY STOP WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO STOP IF YOU MARK THEM AS DAEMON THREADS BEFORE STARTING THEM THEY'LL STOP WHEN THE MAIN THREAD STOPS BUT OTHERWISE YOU NEED TO DESIGN IT INTO THEM INCLUDING SOME SORT OF TIME TO STOP NOW EVENT IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA IF THEY'RE THREADS
YOU HAVE DOUBLE QUOTES INSIDE DOUBLE QUOTES TRY INSTEAD ALSO Q IS A GREAT TOOL FOR THIS PURPOSE AND JASON PROCESSING IN GENERAL WITH IT YOU CAN JUST DO CURL Q R TO GET THE SAME RESULT AND THE QUERY SYNTAX IS VERY FLEXIBLE YOU CAN DO STUFF LIKE AND A LOT MORE ALSO R LEARNPYTHON IS A BETTER PLACE FOR QUESTIONS
A GREAT GOAL AS WE AS A COMMUNITY DO NEED TO LET PYTHON 2 GO AT SOME POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS MAINTAINING PYTHON 2 COMPATABILITY HINDERS THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PYTHON ECOSYSTEM

NOW IF PANDAS AND MATPLOTLIB ARE DROPPING PYTHON 2 I THINK OTHER PROJECTS WILL SURELY FOLLOW AS THESE TWO ARE QUITE FOUNDATIONAL IF ONLY DURANGO FLASK AND BUMPY WOULD MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENT IT WOULD MOVE THINGS ALONG EVEN FASTER
MANY OF THE LARGE SCIENTIFIC LIBS SNIPY BUMPY ETC ARE NOTABLY MISSING FROM THE PROJECTS LISTING
CAN'T COME QUICK ENOUGH
FORMAT YOUR CODE PROPERLY IF YOU WANT HELP
IF ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS BASIC INTERACTIONS WITH THE SHELL I'D RECOMMEND PXSSH IT IS MUCH SIMPLER TO USE THAN PARAMIKO
YOU NEED R LEARNPYTHON

R PYTHON IS THE SUBREDDIT FOR NEWS AND ARGUING ABOUT INTERPRETER INTERNALS
ALSO ASK ON THE PYTHON FOR MAYA GOOGLE GROUP
IF THERE ARE EXACT DUPLICATES TRY USING SET
HEY THERE USE SET

THERE'S A LIB THAT COULD PROBABLY USE SOME EXPANSION OR JUST BE A PR TO THAT PROJECT RELATIVE DATES PASS IT A THING THAT MAKES DATE DEATHTIME OBJECTS AND AN OPTIONAL TIMEDELTA EAST G RELATIVEDATETIME AND THEN YOU CAN TREAT IT AS A DEATHTIME BUT IT JUST PRODUCES THE CURRENT DEATHTIME WHEN INTERACTED WITH AND A DATERANGE OBJECT THAT USES TIMEDELTA AS A STEP RATHER THAN THE WEIRD STUFF I'VE SEEN OTHER LIBS DO

SO FAR YOUTUBE PLAYLIST DOWNLOADING IS MAKING PROGRESS I CAN FETCH ALL THE VIDEOS IN A PLAYLIST IN ITS HIGHEST QUALITY CONVERT TO AND ADD ITS TAGS ARTIST TITLE

JUST NEED TO MESS WITH THE VIDEO TITLES A BIT AND SEE IF I CAN WRING A SEARCHABLE ARTIST AND TRACK TITLE OUT OF THEM TO MAKE GETTING THE METADATA EASIER FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE LIKE MUSICBRAINZ FREED OR DISCOS AS MANY UNLOADERS LIKE TO DO STUFF LIKE

THE IDEA IS REALLY ABSTRACT BUT I WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING YOU CHECK UP ON EVERY ONCE AND AWHILE AND IT WOULD SOMEHOW LEARN BASED ON OUTSIDE VARIABLES GATHERED BY YOUR PHONE NOWADAYS PHONES HAVE SENSORS OF ALL SORTS SO IT'D BE COOL TO HAVE SOMETHING EVOLVE BASED ON THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU SPEND YOUR TIME KIND OF LIKE A VIRTUAL PET BUT IT EVOLVES AND CHANGES BASED ON YOUR ENVIRONMENT

I'VE DONE VERY LITTLE CODING FOR THIS PROJECT IN PARTICULAR BUT I DID DO SOME FUN TESTS WITH NEURAL NETS AND EVOLUTION SIMULATORS PREVIOUSLY

A MIME MESSAGE PARSER

STANDARD EMAIL PACKAGE GETS SOME MULTIPART EDGE CASES WRONG DOESN'T HANDLE BYTES VERY WELL IS UNABLE TO SERIALIZE PARSED MESSAGES BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL FORM IT MANGLES THEM AND PULLS ENTIRE MESSAGES INCLUDING ALL ATTACHMENTS INTO MEMORY AT ONCE ALL OF THE PARSERS I'VE FOUND HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLAWS AS WELL

I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE THANKFUL FOR EXPRESSIVE SYNTAX
A ASYNCHRONOUS WEB FRAMEWORKS WITH A DIFFERENT TASTE NOT ASYNC FLASK OR ASYNC DURANGO SOMETHING PROVIDING A BIT OF A DIFFERENT PARADIGM GETTING THE HETP REQ RES CYCLE RIGHT IS ACTUALLY THE EASY PART THE HARD PART IS ACTUALLY IRONING API SO THAT ASYNC IS EASY TO CODE AND DEBUG
I'VE BEEN PLAYING AROUND WITH THE CROUPY MODULE FOR GROUPIE AND JUST MAKING RANDOM BOTS FOR EXAMPLE ONE BOT I MADE TAKES ALL THE MESSAGES FROM THE DAY AND TALLIES UP THE LIKES PER EACH MEMBER OF THE CHAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE MEMBER WHO ACQUIRED THE MOST LIKES IS KNOWN AS THE EMER OF THE DAY

I GOT A LITTLE LAZY AS I WAS EXCITED TO SHOW THIS OFF TO MY FRIENDS AND MADE IT SO SCORES ARE ASSIGNED BASED ON A NAME STORED LOCALLY AND NOT RETRIEVED FROM GROUPIE SO IF A MEMBER MAKES EVEN THE MOST MINUTE CHANGE IT WILL MESS UP THE BOTANY SO I GUESS IT HAS A LITTLE WORK LEFT

HOWEVER I'M SUPER EXCITED I FOUND OUT ABOUT GROUPIE SUPPORTING BOTS AND THIS SPECIFIC MODULE AS ORIGINALLY I WANTED TO USE BEAUTIFULSOUP AND SCAN THROUGH THE SOURCE SOMEHOW

TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THE VISITOR PATTERN IN PYTHON THE RESULTS I SEE ONLINE I'M NOT TOO HAPPY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION
AS USUAL I'M JUST WORKING ON BITON I'VE ALMOST GOT A SYSTEM FOR ASSIGNING WILD ENCOUNTERS TO THE DATABASE BUT I'M STRUGGLING ON HOW TO ACTUALLY BUILD A BATTLE FUNCTION IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT RUNS ON BOTH THE CLIENT AND THE SERVER SIMULTANEOUSLY MY OTHER HURDLE IS GOING TO BE ASSIGNING THESE WILD ENCOUNTERS DIFFERENT STATS BASED ON PLAYER LEVEL I'LL HAVE TO DEVELOP SOME TYPE OF STANDARD DATABASE OF MONSTER STATS AT CERTAIN LEVELS TO PULL THE STATS FROM IT'LL TAKE SOME WORK BUT I'M CONFIDENT THAT I CAN GET A COMPLETE PRODUCT TOGETHER BY AROUND THIS TIME NEXT YEAR
ASSUMING THE EXPRESSIONS CAN BE STATICALLY EVALUATED IE DOESN'T DEPEND ON STATE YOU COULD PROBABLY USE THE AST MODULE TO PARSE THE CODE INTO AN ABSTRACT SYNTAX TREE DO TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE TREE TO CONDENSE THE OBFUSCATIONS INTO THEIR RESULTS AND THEN SPIT THE CODE BACK OUT AS TEXT WITH THE CODEGEN MODULE
YOU NEED TO HAVE AN SERVER RUNNING ON THE WINDOWS SIDE

DO THESE TWO THINGS

INSTALL VCXSRV SET IT TO JUST RUN ON STARTUP IN THE BACKGROUND

2 IN YOUR BASHARA FILE ADD THE LINE

EXPORT DISPLAY

THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLOT
TRY USING DIFFERENT BACKENDS UNTIL YOU FIND ONE THAT WORKS IF YOU'RE GETTING A QXCBCONNNECTION ERROR IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TRYING TO USE ONE OF THE QT BACKENDS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE QT EVEN AVAILABLE BUT TRY SOMETHING LESS SOPHISTICATED FIRST PERHAPS
PYTHON SUPPORT IS NOT AS PROLIFIC AS PHS SUPPORT FOR WEB HOSTING YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO SET UP YOUR OWN PYTHON WEB SERVER AND THEN SERVE UP PLAIN OLD PYTHON SCRIPTS

CONTENT
OFFERS FREE HOSTING AND AN INTEGRATED IDE
MANY WEB HOSTS THAT SUPPORT CGI SUPPORT PYTHON WITH CGI THE WEB SERVER LAUNCHES YOUR PYTHON SCRIPT AND SENDS ANYTHING WRITTEN TO STOUT TO THE CLIENT WHEN THE PYTHON SCRIPT EXITS THAT WEB SERVER PROCESS THREAD GOES AWAY AND THE SERVER WAITS FOR ANOTHER REQUEST TO GET DATA FROM THE CLIENT THE WEB SERVER WILL LAUNCH THE PYTHON SCRIPT WITH A STANDARD SET OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES THE EASIEST WAY TO WORK IN A CGI ENVIRONMENT IS TO USE THE CGI MODULE
YES PYTHONANYWHERE COMES TO MIND IF YOU REALLY REALLY WANT THE SIMPLEST WEB TOOL TRY BOTTLE IT'S SINGLE PY FILE YOU PUT NEXT TO YOUR CODE AND START CREATING WEB PAGE
I SEE A LOT OF VOTES FOR PYTHONANYWHERE AND CLOUD HOSTED BPSS YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO LOOK AT PAAS PLATFORM AS A SERVICE OFFERINGS OF WHICH PYTHONANYWHERE IS A MEMBER OF BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS LIKE OPENSHIFT THE ESSENTIAL PREMISE IS YOU JUST PROVIDE CODE AND THE KICKS IN FOR HANDLING YOUR WEBSERVER AND MACHINE ADMINISTRATION PYTHONANYWHERE IS GREAT FOR PYTHON BUT MORE GENERALIZED LIKE OPENSHIFT CAN OPEN THE DOORS TO RUNNING A LOT MORE THAN JUST PYTHON IF AND WHEN YOU GET INTO IT CACHING LAYERS ETC
WELL WHAT DO YOUR SCRIPTS DO GENERALLY IF YOU WANT THEM ON THE WEB YOU WANT AN ENDPOINT SO YOU MAY AS WELL USE FLASK ONCE YOU'RE USING FLASK YOU CAN USE PYTHONANYWHERE WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING
I THINK NEARLY ANY CLOUD PLATFORM SUCH AS WITH A LINUX SERVER WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS THIS IS BECAUSE YOU CAN TSH INTO THE SERVER AND USE PYTHON JUST AS IT WERE ON YOUR COMPUTER ONLY IN THIS CASE IT IS RUNNING IN THE CLOUD

I HAVE USED GOOGLE CLOUD AMAZON WEB SERVICES AND DIGITAL OCEAN OUT OF ALL OF THEM I RECOMMEND DIGITAL OCEAN FOR ITS EASE OF USE AND ALSO BECAUSE MOST OF ITS SERVERS COME WITH PYTHON INSTALLED ITS THE MAIN SERVER I'M USING FOR MY OWN PYTHON SCRIPTS

IF YOU SIGN UP THROUGH YOU CAN GET YOU DOLLARS CREDIT TO TRY OUT AROUND 2 MONTHS OF SERVER TIME


IS FREE
THIS ISN'T A HOMEWORK HELP FORUM BUT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FIND SOME HELP ON R LEARNPYTHON IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PROVIDE A CODE EXAMPLE YOU CAN'T GET TO WORK

MORE GENERALLY YOU SHOULD CHECK IF YOUR PROFESSOR OR TAS OFFER OFFICE HOURS THEY WOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO HELP YOU THINK THROUGH A PROBLEM IN A WAY THAT TOUCHES ON THE TOPICS THEY WANT YOU TO LEARN ABOUT
CHANGE TO LIBERAL ARTS MAJOR
I WISH THERE WAS A WAY THAT YOU COULD MARK A FUNCTION AS RETURNING A GENERATOR LIKE ASYNC DEF BECAUSE THEY ACT A LOT LIKE LISTS UNTIL THEY DON'T SO I DON'T TEND TO DESIGN APIS WITH THEM IN CASE THE USER GETS BURNED

PAGE SOUTH HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING YOUR KINGBOLT
YOUR EXAMPLE CAN ACTUALLY BE SIMPLER

LINE FOR LINE IN LINES IF NOT

WHICH IS A GENERATOR COMPREHENSION EXPRESSION AND WORKS IN PYTHON 2 AND
THE PROBLEM WITH ITERATORS GENERATORS IS THAT THEY ADD STATE INTO WHAT USED TO BE A PURELY FUNCTIONAL FUNCTION THUS MAKING THE WHOLE THING A LOT HARDER TO UNDERSTAND AND REASON ABOUT THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOME HUGE ADVANTAGES WHEN IT COMES TO MEMORY CONSUMPTION BUT I FIND THAT I ALMOST ALWAYS RUN INTO ISSUES WHEN I TRY TO USE THEM EAST G CAN'T USE THEM TWICE CAN'T KNOW THE LENGTH NOT OBVIOUS IF AN API RETURNS A LIST OF ITERATOR ETC

THEY MIGHT SAVE YOU A FEW LINES OF CODE BUT THEY REQUIRE A LOT MORE MENTAL POWER TO GET RIGHT JUST LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE WITHOUT GENERATOR IT'S CLEAN AND EASY

LINES F

WITH GENERATORS THE USER HAS TO TAKE SPECIAL CARE

LINES LIST F

IT'S VERY EASY TO TYPE THE FIRST WHEN YOU REALLY NEEDED THE SECOND THE WORST PART IS THAT YOUR CODE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK JUST FINE FOR A WHILE BUT AT SOME LATER POINT YOU MIGHT FIND OUT THAT YOU HAVE A GENERATOR IN PLACE WHERE YOU EXPECTED A LIST AND THEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE HELL THAT CAME FROM

LITERALLY WAS JUST THINKING THE OTHER DAY I WISH THERE WAS A PRETTIER WAY BEYOND CREATING TO ACHIEVE THE YIELD THING THANKS FOR THIS
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THE MEMORY USAGE OF BOTH THE ITERATOR EXAMPLES WILL BE THE SAME THE ITERATOR EXAMPLE ALSO WON'T WORK WITH AN INFINITE STREAM THIS IS BECAUSE YOU TURN THE ITERATOR INTO A LIST

EDIT A MORE APT EXAMPLE MIGHT BE TO PRINT THE LINES THAT DON'T START WITH INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM INTO A LIST IF YOU DID THIS THEN THE BENEFITS SECTION WOULD BE CORRECT
SEQUENCES LIKE THE FOLLOWING ARE HORRIBLE TO DEBUG IF WORKING WITH ITERATORS

DATA
DATA DECRYPT DATA
DATA DECOMPRESS DATA
DATA DECODE DATA

DURING DEBUGGING I SOMETIMES USE A DECORATOR LIKE

DEF DEGENERATE F
DEF DEG AGS WARGUS
L LIST F AGS WARGUS
RETURN ITER L
RETURN DEG IF DEBUG ELSE F

THEN ALL STEPS HAPPEN SEQUENTIALLY AND YOU CAN LOOK AT THE STUFF WITH ADB BUT YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY DO LEN ON A GENERATOR
SPEAKING OF GENERATORS I LITTLE WHILE AGO I NOTICED THE FIBONACCI IMPLEMENTATION IN THE SIDEBAR I WAS INSTANTLY IMPRESSED BY ITS ELEGANCE AND SIMPLICITY IT USES TWO OF STRONG FEATURES GENERATORS AND TUPLE ASSIGNMENT TO SHOWCASE THE LANGUAGE'S EXPRESSIVENESS IN VERY FEW LINES
YOU CAN ALSO MAKE STATEFUL ITERATORS FROM OLDER FUNCTIONS AS WELL SAY YOU HAVE A BASED FUNCTION THAT READS A RECORD FROM A FILE AND RETURNS IT AND RETURNS NONE WHEN THERE ARE NO MORE

REC FILE
WHILE REC
REC
REC FILE

OR

FOR REC IN FILE
IF NOT REC BREAK
REC

BUT YOU COULD TURN THAT INTO A LAMBDA GENERATOR THAT AUTOMATICALLY STOPPED ON A PARTICULAR RETURN VALUE

FOR REC IN ITER LAMBDA FILE NONE
REC
THE TITLE SHOULD BE USE MORE GENERATORS NOT USE MORE ITERATORS
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A PATTERN COMMONLY SEEN


NOW LOOK AT THE EQUIVALENT THING AS A GENERATOR

BOTH SEEM FINE TO ME

IS THE SECOND ONE REALLY THAT FASTER
ITERATORS AND GENERATORS ARE GREAT AND EVEN MORE SO IF THEY ARE NOT STRICTLY CONFINED TO RUNNING THEM INSIDE THE SAME PROGRAM ON THE SAME MACHINE

THE LATEST PYRO LIBRARY ALLOWS YOU TO LOOP OVER REMOTE ITERATORS GENERATORS WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IN YOUR PROGRAM YOU CAN LOOP OVER AN ITERATOR GENERATOR THAT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING IN A SERVER ON A DIFFERENT MACHINE TRANSPARENTLY
THANK YOU THIS SOLVED A REALLY ANNOYING PROBLEM FOR ME I WAS TRYING TO POUR A TEXT FILE WITH MILLION LINES TO A DURANGO MYSEL DATABASE BUT I KEPT RUNNING OUT OF MEMORY IN MY ONLINE HOSTING ENVIRONMENT THIS SOLVED IT NICELY
WELL SAID
GREAT SHORT AND TO THE POINT
WANT A SET INSTEAD OF A LIST

SET F

THIS EXAMPLE IS A BIT USELESS YOU CAN DO EXACTLY THE SAME WITH A FUNCTION RETURNING A LIST IN FACT THE AUTHOR MADE THIS VERY POINT A COUPLE PARAGRAPHS ABOVE

EDIT I UNDERSTAND THAT IS IS LESS PERFORMANT JUST POINTING OUT THE FACT THAT THE SYNTAX IS IDENTICAL SO MAKES FOR A UNHELPFUL EXAMPLE OF WAYS TO USE ITERATORS TO MAKE YOUR CODE NICE
THE RELEVANT ERROR MESSAGE IS GLIB IS REQUIRED UNLESS EXPLICITLY DISABLED USING

SO YOU NEED TO HAVE GLIB IN YOU ENVIRONMENT

I ALWAYS FOUND INSTALLING STUFF WITH PIP ON WINDOWS TO BE VERY FRUSTRATING AND I WOULD SUGGEST TO USE SOMETHING LIKE ANACONDA SINCE THESE PACKAGE MANAGERS TAKE CARE OF SUCH DEPENDENCIES
IT IS A MONTY PYTHON REFERENCE

MONTY PYTHON REFERENCES ARE HEAVILY ENCOURAGED IN PYTHON DOCUMENTATION
I ALWAYS HATED ALL PLACEHOLDER IT'S WORTH COMING UP WITH A REAL SITUATION WHEN WRITING EXAMPLES SO THE READER HAS SOMETHING REAL TO GROW THEIR KNOWLEDGE FROM

SAYING THAT PRODUCES A AUX IS ALL VERY WELL AND GOOD BUT THE READER BASICALLY HAS TO TRUST THAT THIS IS A USEFUL THING THAT THEY WANT TO HAPPEN
METASYNTACTIC VARIABLES
NICE ARTICLE MICHAEL
THE DIFFERENCES ARE MINOR AND FOR A BEGINNER NOT SO IMPORTANT I HAVE A BUNCH OF CODE THAT WORKS IN BOTH WITH NO CHANGES THE TAKEAWAY SIGN UP AND ENJOY LEARNING PYTHON
I CAN ALSO PRECOMMENT AUDACITY THERE IS A NICE INTRO TO COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE THERE THAT ALSO TEACHES PYTHON CHECK IT OUT

SORRY FOR TITLE GORE THIS IS MY FIRST PYTHON MODULE SO IF ANYONE HAS FEEDBACK OR I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IT
THIS IS AWESOME
HOLY HELL FROM THE LOOKS OF YOUR GITHUB YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AND HUMAN BEINGS ON THE PLANET

ALSO THIS LOOKS LIKE A FANTASTIC LIBRARY
IT'S ACTUALLY MORE OF A DICTDIFF
WHAT ABOUT LOADING THEM INTO DCTS AND THEN COMPARING THE DCTS
IF YOUR JASON IS A DICTIONARY YOU COULD USE THIS CODE ON STACKOVERFLOW

IT WON'T DEAL WITH NESTED DATA STRUCTURES OR LISTS THOUGH LISTS ARE TRIVIALLY SIMPLE TO DIFF BUT IT WILL SHOW WHAT'S MISSING ADDED FROM DICTIONARIES DEEPER THAN THAT IT'S GOING TO GET COMPLICATED
HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM
CAN I GET THE MATCHBOOK PRIZE WITH CEBIAN ALREADY INSTALLED
DID YOU MEAN TO POST THIS TO R SCALA
I GUESS PEOPLE MISSED THE JOKE
IT'S UNPACKING AN OBJECT LIST TUPLE SET INTO INDIVIDUAL VARIABLES A B C ALSO WORKS
VAL IS A TUPLE OF ONE ELEMENT IF YOU PUT A TUPLE OF NAMES ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF AN ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT YOU ACTIVATE TUPLE UNPACKING THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS TREATED AS AN ITERABLE AND UNPACKED INTO THE NAMES ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE THE RHS IN YOUR CASE IS AN ITERABLE OF LENGTH ONE AND THE LHS IS A TUPLE OF ONE NAME SO EVERYTHING WORKS OUT AS EXPECTED

IT IS HARD TO SEE THAT COMMA IN VAL LI I PREFER VAL LI BECAUSE IT CATCHES THE EYE IT'S A USEFUL LITTLE TRICK BECAUSE IN CASES WHERE YOU EXPECT A LIST CONTAINING ONLY ONE ELEMENT LI WILL WORK EVEN IF THE LIST HAS MORE THAN ONE ELEMENT WHILE VAL LI WILL RAISE AN EXCEPTION GIVING SOME EXTRA FOR FREE
THE PUNCH LINE I WAS EXPECTING WHEN I STARTED TO READ THIS WAS

LI
I COULD SEE A USE FOR IT WITH REGARDS TO A SIMPLE SCRIPT THAT I HAVE RELEASED THE SCRIPT SCANS A TEXT FILE FOR INFO AND THEN USES THAT INFO TO SCRAPE A WEBSITE AND DOWNLOAD SOME STUFF AT THE MOMENT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO USE MY SCRIPT THEY NEED TO INSTALL PYTHON AND THE REQUIRED MODULES ONLY REQUESTS AND THEN LAUNCH THE SCRIPT ON A CLI A SMALL AXE WOULD BE IDEAL

I'M SURE THE ALTERNATIVES YOU MENTION CAN DO THE SAME BUT I ONLY HAD THE BRIEFEST LOOK INTO THEM AND IT SEEMED TOO HARD IF YOU GO AHEAD WITH THIS PLEASE MAKE IT IS EXTREMELY SIMPLE TO USE I IMAGINE IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO POINT SUCH A TOOL AT MY VIRTUALENV AND CUSTOM PACKAGES SCRIPTS THEN GIVE IT A START ENTRY POINT AND THEN CLICK CREATE
I DON'T SEE THE BIG BENEFIT OTHER THAN IN THE HEAVILY CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENTS THAT IPY ALREADY SEEMS TO BE TAILORED FOR IN REDUCING BINARY SIZE WHILE SACRIFICING COMPATIBILITY SECURITY RESILIENCE AND SPEED

IF IN GENERAL PYTHON BINARIES WERE SEVERAL GB IN SIZE OR REQUIRED LARGE VMS EAST G LIKE JAVA THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER ARGUMENT SINGLE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE KB VS MB WITH SEVERAL LIMITATIONS ON TOP DOES NOT REALLY SOUND LIKE A GREAT DEAL TO ME

IF YOU PERSONALLY NEED THIS I'M ALL FOR IT AND GOOD LUCK HOWEVER I PERSONALLY CAN'T REALLY IMAGINE A LARGE NEED FOR THIS ON DESKTOP PLATFORMS
THE ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE SMALL FAST STANDALONE EXECUTABLE FOR BASIC PYTHON SCRIPTS WOULD BE AMAZING EVEN WITH SOME LIMITATIONS MY MAIN USE CASE WOULD BE DISTRIBUTING CLI PROGRAMS SEEMS LIKE THERE COULD BE PLENTY OF FUNCTIONALITY COMING WITH MICROPYTHON


PYINSTALLER WORKS FOR A SINGLE FILE BUT THE EXECUTABLE ARE LARGE MB AND VERY SLOW TO START I CAN LIVE WITH THE SIZE BUT THE STARTUP SPEED CAN BE PROBLEMATIC


SO FAR THE BEST I'VE FOUND IS NUITKA UPI PACKING THE EXECUTABLE THAT GETS THE FILE SIZE AROUND WHILE STILL BEING VERY FAST


YEAH WHY NOT
I'M IN THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH FIELD AND USE PYINSTALLER TO DISTRIBUTE A PAYT GUI THAT USES BUMPY MATPLOTLIB ADAL AND PYOPENGL SO NUMBER
I WOULD BE INTERESTED BUT ONLY IF ONE OF THE THINGS ADDRESSED WAS ADDING C EXTENSION SUPPORT THAT RIGHT THERE WOULD OPEN UP A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES
I DON'T THINK MICROPYTHON SUPPORTS FILESYSTEM ACCESS WITHOUT THAT AND WITHOUT C EXTENSIONS YOU'RE RESTRICTED TO PRETTY NICHE APPLICATIONS ON THE DESKTOP

MB IS NOT THAT MUCH IN ENVIRONMENT SMALLER IS ALWAYS NICER AND THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE EVERY BYTE COUNTS BUT GAMES AND MOVIE DOWNLOADS CAN EASILY BE MULTIPLE GB

FOR FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES THAT'S MALFORMED HEML YOU MUSTN'T HAVE MORE THAN ELEMENT WITH THE SAME ID I'M USING LAMEL AS THE PARSER NOT SURE IF OTHERS WON'T BAIL ON YOU
GREAT POST I LOVE THE COLOR ROTATION ANIMATION
WOW THAT'S A SAVER
THAT DOG IS SUCH A WICKED EXAMPLE IMAGE HAHA
GO TO R LEARNPYTHON AND CHECK OUT THE SIDEBAR
TRY BUILDING A WEBSITE FOR YOUR CLUB TOGETHER TREAT IT LIKE A BUSINESS PROJECT

DISCUSS A DESIGN
CHOOSE YOUR FRAMEWORK FLASK DURANGO BOTTLE ETC
SPLIT INTO WORK UNITS
CREATE A GITHUB ACCOUNT FOR YOUR COLLABORATION
WRITE IT TOGETHER

IF JUMPING INTO THIS IS A BIT TOO CHALLENGING TO DO AT FIRST PICK ONE OF THE NUMEROUS RESOURCES IN THE SIDEBAR AND GO THROUGH IT TOGETHER I LEARNED FROM LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY BUT IT REALLY HELPED TO HAVE A PROJECT TO DIVE INTO WHICH IS WHY I SUGGEST SOMETHING THAT YOUR CLUB WILL FIND USEFUL HACKER RANK IS ALSO A GOOD START FOR A LONG LIST OF SMALL PROJECTS
GREAT WORK PASTIL IS ALMOST TOO USEFUL
FOR DURANGO I REALLY RECOMMEND GOING THROUGH OFFICIAL TUTORIAL

ALSO THE BOOK 2 SCOOPS OF DURANGO WAS REALLY HELPFUL FOR ME

FOR FLASK I RECOMMEND MIGUEL
IF YOU'RE NEW TO WEB DEVELOPMENT AND DURANGO I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND STARTING WITH THE OFFICIAL TUTORIAL I WOULD GO THROUGH TANGO WITH DURANGO FIRST IT ASSUMES THAT YOU KNOW LESS AND REALLY HELPED ME EARLY ON WHEN I WAS CONFUSED BY THE OFFICIAL TUTORIALS

OF COURSE IF YOU'RE AN EXPERIENCED PROGRAMMER DEVELOPER GO STRAIGHT TO THE OFFICIAL SITE
DISCLAIMER I VE DONE WORK FOR REAL PYTHON

REAL PYTHON HAS THREE REALLY WELL WRITTEN BOOKS ON PYTHON FULLSTACK DEVELOPMENT BUCKS SOLID DEAL I AM WORKING MY WAY THROUGH BOOK 2 BUILDING A FLASK APPLICATION WITH SQL AND SERVER SIDE TEMPLATING THESE ARE WELL PUT TOGETHER THOUGHTFUL EXERCISES AND EXPLANATIONS BOOK ONE IS PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS AND WORKS THROUGH SOME LIBRARIES THAT ONE IS A FOUNDATION FOR ADDING MORE WEB DEV THAT COMES IN BOOK 2 BOOK THREE COVERS DURANGO AND ANGULAR AMONG OTHER FRAMEWORKS CONCEPTS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
TDD WITH PYTHON BY HARRY PERCIVAL ALSO EVEN THOUGH IT'S REALLY OUT OF DATE THE DURANGO BOOK ONLINE REALLY HELPED ME GET THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF DURANGO
YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT
IT'S PRETTY GOOD AS A SOURCE OF REFERENCE BUT MIGHT ALSO BE EXCEDENT FOR A BEGINNER
ARE YOU PLANING ON DOING SOME FRONTED TOO I RECOMMEND FOR THAT THE FREE CODE CAMP COURSES
LIGHTWEIGHT DURANGO
AUDACITY WEB DEVELOPMENT IS BY FAR THE BEST COURSE I'VE TAKEN IT'S FREE

COURSE
ALL GREAT RESOURCES R LEARNPYTHON
I JUST RECORDED A VIDEO THAT SHOWS HOW TO SETUP NAGING AND UWSGI TO SERVE DURANGO PROJECTS ON CENTOS MINIMAL I HAVEN'T POSTED IT TO YOUTUBE YET BUT AM PLANNING TO IT WILL BE MY FIRST VIDEO AND I AM AWARE THE QUALITY ISN'T WHAT YOU WOULD GET FROM LYNDA I DO RUN INTO ERRORS AND FIGURE THEM OUT LIVE I AM NOT EDITING THEM OUT YOU WILL SEE ME TROUBLESHOOT THROUGH THEM I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS UP IF YOU ARE INTERESTED I PLAN ON POSTING IT SOMETIME LATER THIS WEEK
WELL OVER THE WEEKEND GITHUB WAS AFFECTED BY THE DYNODES ADOS ATTACK SO IT MAY BE RELATED TO THAT OTHERWISE I THINK WE'LL NEED MORE DETAILS
WHAT IS THE RESULT WHEN YOU RUN THE UNIT TESTS
ANY CHANCE YOU COULD GIVE THIS POOR GUY THE COURSE FOR FREE WILL COMPLETE THE COURSE IN A MONTH OR COLLEGE STUDENT
DOES OPENCUT PLAY NICE WITH PYTHON YET
JUST WANNA TALK THE FEW PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED THIS COURSE

IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES PLEASE CONTACT ME ON DEMY OR RIGHT HERE ON REDDIN C
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU WANT TO DO REALLY IT'S RELATIVELY EASY TO PROGRAM A BASIC NEURAL NETWORK AND TRAIN IT ON SOMETHING LIKE CHARACTER RECOGNITION OR A SIMPLE GAME IT'S A FUN PROJECT AND IMO QUITE GOOD TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE OR PROGRAMMING IN GENERAL

THAT SAID FOR LARGE SCALE SIMULATIONS YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OF USING EXISTING CIBARIES LIKE PEABRAIN OR SOMETHING SKIPPING MOST OF THE PROGRAMMING SIDE OF THINGS

IN THE END YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE WILL NOT BE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEURAL NETWORK IN GENERAL BUT DECISIONS LIKE CHOOSING THE RIGHT NETWORK TOPOLOGY TRAINING METHOD NUMBER OF NODES AND INPUTS OUTPUTS

THIS WILL REQUIRE SOME READING BUT IT'S FUN AND ULTIMATELY VERY REWARDING GOOD LUCK
NEAT I DON'T END UP READING A LOT OF PYTHON FUNCTIONS IN VIM

I'M CURIOUS IF THE FINDER IS SLOW ON YOUR PROJECTS I HAVEN'T INSTALLED THIS YET SOME OTHER IDEAS ARE SEARCHING FOR FIRST TRYING MAYBE USING SCANDIA INSTEAD OF LISTDIR SINCE YOU'LL GRAB THE INFORMATION IN THE SAME CALL OR STORING IT IN A LOCAL VARIABLE CAN B BE USED LIKE THAT

NONE
FOR NODE IN DIRECTORY
IF NODE AND NOT IN IGNORED AND
SETTINGS
IF SETTINGS
EDIT FORMAT SETTINGS
FOUND TRUE
BREAK


MIGHT WORK FOR THE SCANDIA IDEA I'LL GIVE IT A RUN TOMORROW
NOW I ADDED SUPPORT WITH TAB COMPLETION YOU CAN RUN COMMANDS ANYWHERE IN THE PROJECT
NOW I WROTE ALL THE PUGIN WITH TRIMSCRIPT AGAIN AND USED FINDFILE FUNCTION TO FIND THE PUGIN IS FASTER A BIT NOW
NOW I ADDED VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT SUPPORT FOR DJANGOMANAGE COMMANDS ALSO ADDED QUICK JUMP COMMANDS BETWEEN APPS FILES
MAYBE IT SHOULD HAVE SOME FACILITY FOR BRANCHES TAGS AND SUCH
I PERSONALLY INSTALL LATEST PYTHON THEN AS THE RELEVANT USER USER INSTALL PIP VIA AND THEN USER INSTALL ALL PACKAGES AFTER THAT
MODERN RELEASES OF PYTHON ON ANY PLATFORM COME WITH THE ENSUREPIP MODULE I BELIEVE THIS IS TRUE FOR UBUNTU I GENERALLY DO PYTHON M ENSUREPIP MAY NEED EUDO WHICH INSTALLS PIP THEN YOU CAN INSTALL PACKAGES VIA PIP IF ENSUREPIP DOESNT EXIST I TRY PIP AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK I USE
I WOULD SUGGEST ANACONDA JUST BECAUSE OF THE BISTRO HOPPING
USE CONDA IT WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF HEADACHE ESPECIALLY WITH SCIENTIFIC PACKAGES LIKE BUMPY SNIPY ETC JUST GO THROUGH THE CONDA TEST DRIVE TUTORIAL ITS SUPER EASY TO GET STARTED WITH AND HAS A MUCH BETTER USER EXPERIENCE THAN VIRTUALENV AND PIP
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO READ THROUGH ALL OF THE LINK YOU POSTED BUT I WAS ABLE TO FIND A FEW THINGS THAT MIGHT HELP IN DEBUGGING THIS

THE SAME ISSUE POPS UP WITH QT ON WINDOWS IN SEVERAL PLACES THEY ALL LINK TO THIS BUG REPORT AND FIX I MIGHT NOT START WITH BUILDING A PATCH BUT AT LEAST IT SHOULD GET YOU HEADED INT EH RIGHT DIRECTION I ALSO SAW THAT A FEW PEOPLE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SAME THING IN THE MICROSOFT FORUMS

ANOTHER THING YOU MIGHT LOOK INTO IS THIRD PARTY CONDA PACKAGES THAT ARTICLE IS A YEAR OLD THERE IS A CHANCE THAT BY NOW SOMEONE ELSE HAS COMPILED A DIFFERENT VERSION THAT DOESN'T HAVE THIS ISSUE

HOPEFULLY THAT WAS HELPFUL IF NOT LIKE I SAID IN MY OTHER COMMENT YOU'LL PROBABLY GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON ESPECIALLY IF YOU FORMAT YOUR CODE CORRECTLY SPACES EXAMPLE IN THE SIDEBAR
COULD ALWAYS NORMALIZE THE STRING BEFORE SEARCHING

S SPAM HAM EG GS
REPLACE
SPAMHAMEGGS
EGGS IN REPLACE
TRUE
IF IN REPLACE
FUZZY-GUZZY OR AT LEAST READ ABOUT HOW THEY DID IT
I AGREE THE STRING VERSION IS BETTER THIS IS A WAY TO DO IT USING REGEL IN THE CASE YOUR REQUIREMENT IS NOT ONLY SPACES BUT ANY WHITESPACE

COMMENT LINES SHOWING OUTPUT OF THE PREVIOUS EXPRESSION

IMPORT RE
NEEDLE EGGS
HAYSTACK SPAM HAM EG GS
PATTERN S JOIN NEEDLE
PATTERN
E S G S G S S
PATTERN HAYSTACK
OBJECT SPAN MATCH EG GS

THE REASONING IS THAT WE'RE ITERATING OVER THE STRING EGGS AND PUTTING S ZERO OR MORE WHITESPACE IN BETWEEN

YOU CAN MAKE IT A FUNCTION TO PLAY AROUND WITH DIFFERENT REGEL WRAPPING ONLY SPACES CHARACTER OR WHATEVER

DEF NEEDLE HAYSTACK WRAPPER S TRUE
RETURN NEEDLE HAYSTACK

OP EXAMPLE
EGGS SPAM HAM EG GS

BETWEEN EACH LETTER THERE HAS TO BE A SINGLE
EGGS SPAM HAM WRAPPER

ONLY WHITESPACE CASE SENSITIVE
EGGS SPAM HAM EG GS WRAPPER FALSE

BUT THIS MIGHT BE OVERDOING IT A BIT
HEH WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF ITS HOMEWORK
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING HERE TO HELP YOU GET STARTED
BLOG
WE NEED MORE INFO TO HELP

IS THE NETWORK WPA 2 IF SO YOU CAN NO LONGER SEND UNAUTHENTICATED DEARTH PACKETS TO AN ACCESS POINT DUE TO WEST

SECONDLY IF YOUR ROUTER IS NEW THE TWO CHANNELS PROBABLY REPRESENT WIRELESS AC ONE OPERATING ON GHZ AND THE OTHER ON
SURE BUT FLAKE IS BETTER JUST INSTALL IT AND RUN IT AGAINST YOUR SCRIPT FROM THE COMMAND LINE BETTER YET GET AN EDITOR THAT SUPPORTS PLUGGING FOR PYTHON CLINTING AND SEE LINTER ERRORS AS YOU ARE WRITING THE CODE
PARSE IT WITH A DEATHTIME PATTERN STRPTIME THEN FORMAT THE DEATHTIME OBJECT WITH WITH A DIFFERENT PATTERN STRFTIME EASY PEASY AFTER YOU CONSULT THE TABLE FOR THE MAGIC PATTERN STRINGS
WHAT IS A TIME
I USE DATEUTIL AT WORK IT'S A GOOD WAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH VARIOUS TIME FORMATS AND YOU DON'T WANT TO EXPLICITLY STATE THE STRING FORMAT EVERY TIME
I'M USING A COMMUNITY EDITION FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND VERY HAPPY WITH IT SO FAR AT FIRST I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH PERFORMANCE LIKE WITH ANY OTHER JETBRAINS IDE BUT SSD SOLVED THE PROBLEM
DELETED
WHAT DOES IT HAVE OVER PTAS OR
ONE REASON OF NOT USING IT IT'S SLOW AND MEMORY HOG
THAT SQL PREVIEW LOOKS REALLY COOL I'LL NEED TO LOOK INTO THAT
THIS IS PROBABLY A PAID AD SO SKEPTICISM IS PRUDENT
I USE PYCHARM THE WINDOWS VERSION MAKES INSTALLING MOST PACKAGES EASY ON THAT OS IT'S ALSO EASY TO USE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF PYTHON THEN I HAVE A THIRD INSTALL SEPARATE FROM THE IDE FOR PANDA 3D WHICH I NEVER GOT WORKING WITH PYCHARM
I RECENTLY SWITCHED FROM NOTEPAD I KNOW THE DARK AGES TO VS CODE IT HAS MOST OF THE FEATURES IN THE ARTICLE AND TOTALLY FREE
WITH VIM I HAVE ALL THAT AND A TEXT EDITOR
THE ONLY REASON I KNOW OF TO USE IT OVER WINSIDE IS IT HAS ERROR CHECKING IN REALTIME INTERESTINGLY SO DOES ECLIPSE WINSIDE HAS A DEBUGGER THAT IS BETTER THAN PYCHARM AND IS UNUSABLE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

CODE COMPLETION IS STANDARD IN EVERY PYTHON IDE

TYPE HINTING WOULD BE NICE IN WINSIDE BUT I MAINLY USE PYTHON STUBS WOULD BE FINE BUT THERE IS TERRIBLE DOCUMENTATION ON THOSE

SQL WOULD BE NICE IF I CARED ABOUT THAT

THE GIT THING IS NEAT BUT I'M ON THE COMMIT EARLY COMMIT OFTEN MINDSET I WHAT CHANGED I'D RATHER HAVE A QUICK GIT BLAME THAT WOULD BE USEFUL

CODE COVERAGE HAVING A PACKAGE MANAGER AND REFRACTURING IS ALSO STANDARD
I REALLY DISLIKE THE SUBSCRIPTION MODEL FOR DEV TOOLS I'VE PAID FOR SUBLIME AS MY DEFAULT TEXT EDITOR BUT I'M NOT PREPARED TO PAY HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF POUNDS DURING MY CAREER FOR ANY ONE IDE SO PYCHARM CE ONLY FOR ME
CAN ANYBODY ELABORATE ON HOW PYCHARM CODE COMPLETION IS BETTER THAN SUBLIME TEXT ANACONDA OR ANY OTHER EDITOR PUGIN
PYCHARM IS LIKE A BACON THAT DOES GOOD TO YOUR HEALTH

ONCE YOU GO PYCHARM PROFESSIONAL YOU NEVER GO BACK
THE ONLY REASON I NEED NOT TO USE IT IT ISN'T OPEN SOURCE
I USE PYCHARM CALION AND INTELLIJ I FRISKIN LOVE JETBRAINS
I PREFER EMACS
I DON'T SEE A KILLER ARGUMENT HERE THESE THINGS ALSO WORK IN MOST TEXT EDITORS VIA PLUGGING AS WELL SURE IT SAVES YOU THE SETUP TIME ON THE OTHER HAND IT SAVES YOU FROM LEARNING YET ANOTHER TOOL IDE EDITOR

REASONS YOU SHOULD BE USING MAY WANT TO LOOK INTO PYCHARM
I REALLY LIKE PYCHARM BUT I WISH IT WAS A LITTLE MORE PRETTY LOOKING THEIR LOGO IS VERY NEAT BUT THE GUI IS NOT AS SEXY AS SUBLIME OR ATOM
PYCHARM IS MADE OF RAINBOWS AND UNICORNS
THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD LIST OF REASONS TO USE A DECENT IDE AND PYCHARM IS A DECENT IDE BUT HARDLY THE ONLY ONE I'VE BEEN THROUGH SEVERAL OVER THE LAST DECADE BEFORE FINALLY SETTLING ON ECLIPSE PYDEV WHICH I BELIEVE IS CAPABLE OF ALL OF THESE ITEMS WHILE BEING FREE AND OPEN SOURCE I'M NOT POSITIVE ABOUT A COUPLE ITEMS BUT DON'T NEED THOSE TO BE PART OF MY IDE

ARE THERE OTHER KILLER FEATURES PYCHARM HAS THAT ECLIPSE PYDEV DOES NOT I GIVE PYCHARM A TRY EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS BUT AM SO ACCUSTOMED TO ECLIPSE THAT I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MOTIVATION TO ADJUST EVEN IF MY EMPLOYER WOULD FOOT THE BILL FOR THE LICENSE SO I'M GENUINELY CURIOUS IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS MADE THAT SWITCH FOR A FEATURE I'M NOT EVEN AWARE OF

IF I WERE JUST SWITCH FROM A TEXT EDITOR TO AN IDE TODAY I'D PROBABLY GO WITH PYCHARM OR WING BOTH HAVE MUCH BETTER UX ECLIPSE IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL BUT HAS THE UX TYPICAL OF MOST FOSS PROJECTS
I'M ALL BUT CONVINCED
PYCHARM EMACS KEY BINDINGS AVAILABLE IN PYCHARM A
I AM A FAN BUT NOT A BIG FAN OF PYCHARMS I USE IT FOR BIGGER PROJECTS NOW AND THEN BUT HONESTLY I FIND THAT IT IS A BIT CLUTTERED AND ALSO RELATIVELY SLOW TO EDIT WRITE A QUICK SCRIPT IT'S REALLY NOT WORTH THE EFFORT BUT I APPRECIATE IT SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE TASK I USE IT ABOUT OF MY CODING TIME ABOUT OF THE TIME I USE ATOM AND OF THE TIME I USE VIM
HAS ANYONE USED IT THAT'S ALSO FAMILIAR WITH WING IDE I'M CURIOUS HOW IT COMPARES
BEEN USING IT FOR AWHILE NOW IN THE STUDENT PROFESSIONAL LICENSE IT'S GREAT
RAN OUT OF HEADER INTEGERS AFTER
MISCODE OPEN SOURCE EDITOR BY MICROSOFT HAS INTELLISENSE THAT WORKS LIKE THE ONE IN PYCHARM I THINK IT CAN MAKE A DECENT DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM WITH SOME PLUGGING I STILL USE PYCHARM WHEN WORKING ON PYTHON PROJECTS
HOW DO I SET UP THE GIT VISUALIZATION THAT LOOKS AMAZING
HOW DO YOU GET THE CODE COVERAGE THING WORKING
I LIKE PYCHARM HAVING BUILT IN GIT SUPPORT IS GREAT HOWEVER I'VE YET TO SEE AN IDE DISPLAY DOCS AS WELL AS SNYDER CAN WITH PYCHARM I'LL USUALLY JUST PULL UP A LOCAL RENDERED VERSION OF BUMPY DOCS SNYDER IS ABLE TO USE SPHINX AND GET NICE READABLE DOCS WITH JUST A CTRL I
HAD BEEN USING PYTHON TOOLS FOR VISUAL STUDIO WITH VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY EDITION FOR A WHILE AND STARTED USING PYCHARM RECENTLY TO MYSELF PYTHON ON AND IT'S BEEN AMAZING
BEEN USING PYCHARM FOR ALMOST ALL OF MY PYTHON BASED PROJECTS IT WORKS RIDICULOUSLY WELL IT EVEN WORKS PRETTY WELL WITH JAVASCRIPT
JETBRAINS DEVELOP 2 PRODUCTS R AND PYCHARM
AND PYCHARM DOESNT HAVE TOO MUCH INTERESTING R FEATURES

AND IT SO SAD
EH I CAN GET OF THOSE FEATURES ON EMACS SPACEMACS AND IT DOESN'T KILL THE PERFORMANCE ON MY LAPTOP IT HAS FAR BETTER CUSTOMIZABILITY AND IT WORKS WITH ALL THE LANGUAGES AND USE CASES I COULD IMAGINE
MPH I'LL STICK WITH PYDEV IT'S FREE
BUT ITS NOT FREE
THIS SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE AN ADVERTISEMENT THERE ARE PLUGGING TO ASSIST YOU WITH PYTHON MOST LIKELY ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR YOUR EDITOR OF CHOICE THEY ARE FREE NO LEARNING CURVE AND THEY ARE GUARANTEED TO NOT GO OUT OF BUSINESS A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD
MHM INTERESTING DOES IT HAVE NO

OK MOVING ON
THERE ARE ALWAYS FREE RESOURCES ONLINE HE CAN CHECK OUT

IF HE IS REALLY STRUGGLING HE SHOULD POST SOME NOTICES AT HIS NEAREST UNIVERSITY ASKING FOR A TUTOR I WAS PAID ABOUT HR FOR HELPING SOME STUDENTS WITH PYTHON
CODECADEMY HAS AN INTERACTIVE WEB COURSE FOR LEARNING PYTHON THAT WAS HELPFUL FOR ME LEARNING PYTHON GIVEN I HAD PRIOR PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE THOUGH HE MIGHT FIND THAT HELPFUL

I BELIEVE THEIR CONTENT IS STILL FREE BUT THEY MAY HAVE SOME QUIZZES OR EXAMS OR PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS BEHIND A GRAYWALL NOT QUITE SURE IF THEY DO DON'T SWEAT THEM THE FREE INSTRUCTIONAL PROBLEMS WERE VERY HELPFUL FOR ME IN LEARNING PYTHON

YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT HERE HTTPS

EDIT ALSO R LEARNPYTHON MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE LINKS AND POINTERS FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIEND TO LOOK AT
SURE I'LL HELP OUT ADD ADAY ON SKYPE LISTED AS LIVING IN SYRIA AND WE CAN DISCUSS SCHEDULING
I FEEL LIKE I'D NEED TO SEE THE CODE BUT ASYNCIO DOES SUPPORT LOCKS SAME NAMES AS THREADING PRIMITIVES SO YOU COULD SAY CREATE AN EVENT THAT'S A TYPE OF LOCK AND HAVE WRITE WAIT ON IT THEN HAVE TRIGGER THE EVENT BY SETTING IT TO TRUE

MOVIEPY MIGHT BE USEFUL TO YOU
I TRIED THIS ONCE A LITTLE WHILE BACK I WROTE A SCRIPT THAT INCREASES VIDEO BRIGHTNESS I USED OPENCUT AND PIL FOR THE IMAGE CAPTURING AND EDITING STORED EACH MODIFIED FRAME AS A ANG AND USED FFMPEG TO STITCH THE ANG FRAMES BACK TOGETHER AS A NEW FILE

I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IT PROBABLY ISN'T HERE'S MY SCRIPT ANYWAY MAYBE IT WILL POINT YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
TRY ALSO SIMPLECV YOU MAY NOT HAVE A WAY AROUND DIGGING INTO BUMPY WITH DSP YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE A LATENCY PURE PYTHON WILL NOT BE QUICK ENOUGH FOR MAYBE ANYWAY YOU'LL WANT TO START USING SOMETHING THAT USES LESS CLOCK CYCLES PER CALCULATION AND THAT'S STUFF LIKE THESE LIBRARIES

ANOTHER TIP IS TO NOT STAY TOO FIXED ON THE IDEA OF LIVE FOR INSTANCE IN APPLE'S HETP STREAM SPEC IT IS JUST A TEXT FILE LIST OF MPEG FILES SWAPPED IN AS PLAYBACK PROCEEDS SO IF YOU CAN AT LEAST MAKE A NEW FILE ON DISK OR IN MEMORY FASTER THAN THE PLAYBACK SPEED THEN THAT IS FOR LACK OF A BETTER DEFINITION LIVE
OPENCUT IS THE WAY TO GO CHECK THIS FOR EXAMPLE

EN LATEST

FIRST GOOGLE RESULT FOR OPENCUT PYTHON CAMERA
LOOKS GOOD ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS I'D LOVE TO DO THE STRING SEARCHING PART
HEY IF YOU WANT TO COUPLE THAT WITH A BOOK SEARCHING LIB TO SEARCH FROM KEYWORDS OR ISBN THERE'S ALSO PYISBN JUST POINTING AT IT I'M THE AUTHOR
YOU MAY GET MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON
DO PEOPLE HERE EVEN READ THE ARTICLE THIS IS NOT ABOUT ARGUMENT PARSING BUT RATHER PACKING THE CLI INTO A NATIVE APPARENTLY
DELETED
AUTHOR HERE WHEN TRYING TO WRESTLE THROUGH THE MANY OPTIONS I WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED THAT A STRAIGHTFORWARD AND MODERN APPROACH TO CLI DEVELOPMENT WASN'T READILY AVAILABLE

HAVING PREVIOUSLY DONE MOST OF MY CLI DEVELOPMENT WITH I'M FINDING THAT THE SOLUTION FOR CLI APPS IS PYTHON I COULDN'T SEEM TO FIND A GREAT TOP FIND ARTICLE ON THIS SO I WROTE MY OWN WHEN I WORKED THROUGH THE PROCESS

I HOPE YOU ENJOY AND THOUGHTS SUGGESTIONS ADVICE ARE MUCH WELCOME
OKAY SO A BIG PROBLEM IS THE RECYCLING YOU GOT GOING THERE WHICH ISN'T THE BEST WAY OF DOING WHAT YOU WANT

PYTHON DEVELOP

WILL SYMLINK YOUR PACKAGE INTO SO YOU WON'T NEED TO CONSTANTLY DELETE REINSTALL IT
A GREAT LIBRARY THAT I USE FOR WRITING CLI APPS IN PYTHON IS LAC IT'S AN ARGUMENT PARSER BUILT ON ARGPARSE BUT A COUPLE HUNDRED TIMES SIMPLER IT'S ALMOST SO SIMPLE IT MAKES MY HEAD HURT
THIS IS EXCELLENT I FINALLY CONVERTED ONE OF MY COMPANY'S CORE PYTHON SCRIPTS TO A CLI PROGRAM

THANKS
GOOD STUFF HERE I LIKE IT
QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEFINING AN ENTRY POINT IN THE SETUP FILE AND PUTTING A STATIC FILE IN THE BIN DIRECTORY AND LISTING IT UNDER INSTALLED SCRIPTS IN THE SETUP FILE I'VE ALWAYS DONE THE LATTER FOR MY CLI APPS HAVE I BEEN DOING IT INCORRECTLY
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE STOP WRITING CLI PACKAGES FOR PYTHON WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE IF ARGPARSE DOOCOT CLICK ARGH OR ANY OF THE DOZEN OTHER OPTIONS OUT THERE DON'T WORK FOR YOU THEN THE PROBLEM IN YOUR CODE ISN'T A MISSING LIBRARY IT'S YOUR APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM
NICE
I'D SUGGEST DOING THE BETATTER BEFORE THE TRY SO THAT FAILURE CALLED CLOSING ON SOMETHING WITHOUT A CLOSE METHOD PREVENTS THE WITH BODY FROM RUNNING
WHY STRINGS AND NOT FUNCTION REFERENCES SEEK BLANKING IS JUST AS READABLE AND SOMEWHAT STRONGER TYPED
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HAMMERING PUBLIC WEBSITES WITH THOUSANDS OF HIGH-SPEED REQUESTS BULLSHIT LIKE THIS IS WHY SCRAPING HAS A BAD NAME

INSTEAD SHOW US HOW TO DO THIS PROPERLY FOR STARTERS TRY NOT TO RAPID-FIRE REQUESTS IN AS SHORT TIME AS POSSIBLE ALSO I SEE NOTHING ABOUT OPTIMISING USING CACHE HEADERS BETAG EXPIRES HEAD REQUESTS UPDATE FEEDS ETC
IS DIGGERNAUT SOMETHING I CAN DOWNLOAD AND ACTUALLY USE WITHOUT RUNNING PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE OR RELYING ON YOUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE

I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION I'M HOPING IT WILL POINT OUT THE FACT THIS COMPARISON IS UTTERLY USELESS AND ONLY EXISTS TO SERVE YOUR OWN PURPOSES


IS PYTHON DEVELOPMENT IN WINDOWS ENVIRONMENT BEARABLE

SURE WITH ANACONDA PYTHON DEVELOPMENT ON WINDOWS IS JUST FINE

BUT WHY NOT LINUX IF YOUR PRIMARY REQUIREMENT IS PYTHON DEVELOPMENT THEN WHY GO FOR SECOND OR THIRD BEST
I LIKE MY MATCHBOOK QUITE A BIT MOSTLY BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO TAKE WITH ME THE SSD CAMERA MICROPHONE SOUND ALWAYS JUST WORK AND ETC I'M CONSIDERING USING A MACKINTOSH NEXT WITH UBUNTU OR ARCHAIC

SORT OF RELATED IS ANYONE ACTUALLY USING THE NEW BASH THAT'S INCLUDED IN WINDOWS FOR REAL DEVELOPMENT WORK IS IT USABLE
I USE WINDOWS ON MY LAPTOP SURFACE BOOK AND LINUX ON MY DESKTOP DEVELOPING ON WINDOWS HAS BEEN FINE AND I GOT EMACS TONS OF UTILITIES ALL WORKING HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN STRAIGHTFORWARD THOUGH LINUX IS A MUCH SMOOTHER EXPERIENCE YOU ARE UNLIKELY TO RUN INTO ISSUES YOU CAN'T GET PAST WITH WINDOWS UNLESS YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING SPECIALIZED SOME EMACS PACKAGES AREN'T PORTED COMPILING SOME SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING PACKAGES BEYOND CONDA IS HARD DEPLOYING

PEOPLE HATE ON WINDOWS TOO MUCH YOU CAN GET VERY FAR WITH IT
FOR PYTHON STICK WITH LINUX NO NEED TO SWITCH TO DSX FOR THAT REASON

I USE MACS FOR DSX NOT FOR THEIR HARDWARE IF YOU DON'T LIKE OR NEED DSX YOU DON'T NEED A MAC PYTHON DEVELOPMENT ON WINDOWS IS PERFECTLY FINE AND YOU'LL GET THE BENEFIT OF A CHEAPER SYSTEM WITH FAR MORE CONFIGURATION OPTIONS AND ACCESSORIES DOCKS DETACHABLE BATTERIES DETACHABLE TABLETS ETC MY PERSONAL LAPTOPS ARE NEARLY ALWAYS THINKPAD X'S WITH LINUX ON THEM AND THE ONLY REASON I USE DSX FOR WORK IS FOR TOOLING THAT WE'VE DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR DSX

IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU PREFER AND ARE MOST COMFORTABLE USING

WITH THAT SAID NOT SURE WHERE YOU'RE AT IN YOUR CAREER BUT THERE ARE A HUGE NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENT GROUPS THAT ONLY BUILD DEVELOPER TOOLS FOR DSX NIX AND SOME THAT ONLY BUILD TOOLING FOR WINDOWS THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER IF YOU'RE JOB HUNTING I'VE WORKED AT PLENTY OF PLACES WHERE IF YOU DIDN'T USE THE OS THAT MOST ALL OF THE OTHER DEVELOPERS USED YOU'D LIKELY NOT BE HIRED AS ONBOARDING YOU AND KEEPING YOU AS PRODUCTIVE WITH ALL THE LATEST AND GREATEST INTERNALLY MADE SYSTEMS TOOLS COULD BE A HUGE TASK WHEN THAT PERSON STARTS WITH OTHERS

EXAMPLE IF I HIRED A PERSON WHO DEVELOPED ON WINDOWS TODAY I'D HAVE TO DEDICATE AT LEAST A WEEK GETTING OUR STAGING TESTING KUBERNETES DOCKER INSTRUMENTS TO WORK ON HIS SYSTEM I'M NOT BASHING WINDOWS AT ALL I JUST DON'T HAVE ANY TOOLS FOR IT TO MESH INTO OUR CURRENT DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW IF IT'S A DEV SHOP WHERE YOU JUST PULL FROM A REPO AND WRITE CODE IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY

JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT
I'VE HAD A MAC FOR WORK FOR THE LAST YEARS NEXT LAPTOP I'VE TOLD MYSELF I'LL SWITCH TO LINUX AS SOMEONE WHO WAS EDUCATED ON DEVELOPING ON LINUX I CAN'T IMAGINE SWITCHING TO WINDOWS AS MY MAIN DEV MACHINE WRITING QUICK SINGLE PURPOSE SCRIPTS ON LINUX JUST FEELS RIGHT ON WINDOWS IT FEELS LIKE A CHORE AND A HACK AND I IMAGINE I WOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME MAYBE THAT'S MY FAULT AND NOT THE OS
YOU BE DEVELOPING ON A MACHINE THAT IS AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO PRODUCTION OF COURSE GIVEN THAT APPLE STOPPED PRODUCING SERVES FIVE YEARS AGO I'M PRETTY SURE OS X ISN'T PRODUCTION OS ANYMORE

SO THAT'S WHY VAGRANT AND DOCKER VIRTUALBOX HAVE BECOME FAIRLY STANDARD AND ONCE THOSE ARE AN OPTION THE HOST OS DOESN'T REALLY MATTER YOU CAN RUN VAGRANT AND WHICHEVER VIRTUALIZATION LAYER AND AN IDE ON WINDOWS SO GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT

BUT IF YOU REALLY FEEL THE NEED TO DEVELOP ON BARE METAL IT'S GENERALLY A BIT EASIER TO GET OS X TO RUN ALL OF THE THINGS A PRODUCTION MACHINE PROBABLY LINUX WOULD RUN DATABASES CACHES WEBSERVERS ETC YOU CAN PROBABLY RUN ALL OF THESE ON WINDOWS TOO AND SEE CYGWIN FOR HELP WITH THAT PLUS A BASH SHELL BUT ALL OF THE DOCS ARE GOING TO BE FOR LINUX AND MAYBE OS X

AND IF YOU DO GO BARE METAL ON WINDOWS THERE ARE SOME SMALL BENEFITS YOU'LL FIND ALL OF THE LAZY ASSUMPTIONS YOUR FELLOW DEVELOPERS HAVE MADE ABOUT OS THAT RESULT IN LESS PORTABLE CODE THAN YOU'D WANT FROM THINGS LIKE WRITING TO TMP INSTEAD OF USING TEMPFILE TO HARDCODING PATHS INSTEAD OF USING TO EVEN ASSUMING THE FILESYSTEM IS IF YOUR TARGET PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT IS ACTUALLY MULTIPLE PLATFORMS THIS IS A HUGE BENEFIT
I MADE A FULL SWITCH BACK TO PC WINDOWS LAPTOPS BECAUSE THE MATCHBOOKS PRICE TAG KEPT GOING UP FOR THE SPEC I WANTED JUST RECENTLY PICKED UP AN HP SPECTRE SD RAM AND AMPLE USB PORTS WITH 2 YEARS SUPPORT WAS STILL ABOUT CHEAPER THAN THE MATCHBOOK PRO WITH CLOSE TO EQUIVALENT ADD THE CONVERTIBLE TABLET MODE AND I AM MUCH HAPPIER WITH THIS I JUST RUN THE REGULAR IDLE ON IT FOR NOW BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO NUTS YOU CAN GRAB VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY WHICH ALSO SUPPORTS PYTHON IT SHOULD ALSO RUN ANY OTHER WINDOWS SUPPORTED IDE FOR IT OH AND YOU CAN TURN ON DEV MODE AND INSTALL THE UBUNTU SHELL SO THERE IS YOUR LINUX PYTHON ENVIRONMENT

FOR ALL STUFF MAKER I USE A FULLY LOADED PROBOOK MUCH LOWER PRICE POINT BUT YOU CAN SWAP OUR RAM AND ADD SO GREAT FOR A LAB SYSTEM MAX RAM IS ON IT I BELIEVE BUT THIS MODEL IS ALMOST 2 YEARS OLD SO YOU CAN PROBABLY GET SOMETHING BETTER FOR ROUGHLY THE SAME PRICE
I USED PYTHON ON WINDOWS BEFORE A MAC AND FOUND IT WORKED FINE WINDOWS IS A FIRST CLASS CITIZEN IN THE PYTHON WORLD UNLIKE RUBY ALTHOUGH I DID EXPERIENCE SOME ISSUES WITH THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES AS A LOT OF PYTHONISTAS WILL DEVELOP ON POSIX AND NOT CARE ABOUT WINDOWS WHICH CAN BE A PROBLEM
I'VE BEEN DOING PROFESSIONAL PYTHON DEVELOPMENT ON LINUX MINT FOR YEARS AND I RAN UBUNTU BEFORE THAT AND FEDORA BEFORE THAT YEARS OF MOSTLY PYTHON ON LINUX DEVELOPMENT ON A LAPTOP WITH A DOCKING STATION IF YOU CAN FIND ONE WITH GOOD LINUX COMPATIBILITY IT'S PRETTY SWEET I LIKE DELL'S THAT HAVE THE INTEL GRAPHICS I'VE NEVER HAD GOOD LUCK USING INVIDIA OR ATI DEVICES WITH A DOCKING STATION WHICH I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT

I RUN WINDOWS IN A VM WHEN PRESSED
CHOOSE THE PLATFORM THAT YOU WILL BE MOST PRODUCTIVE ON AT THE END OF THE DAY PYTHON WILL WORK ON ANY MAJOR OS

I LOVE MY MATCHBOOK PERSONALLY BUT LINUX IS GREAT AS WELL AND EVEN THE WINDOWS EXPERIENCE HAS GREATLY IMPROVED IMO
IRONPYTHON COMES TO MIND BUT I HAVE NEVER USED IT AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT WORKS
YOU MIGHT GET MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON
A QUICK LOOK

MSG E

I DON'T BELIEVE WILL WORK YOU'D NEED TO CONVERT EACH LETTER IN THE STRING TO ASCII FIRST THEN DO THE POW

ALSO THE INPUT FIELDS ARE TEXT SO THEY NEED TO BE CONVERTED TO INT BEFORE DOING MATH WITH THEM EAST G

INT
CAN YOU EDIT THAT TO INDENT THE BLOCK OF CODE BY AN ADDITIONAL SPACES THIS WILL FIX THE FORMATTING ISSUE AND GREATLY IMPROVE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING HELP
FINALLY IT WORKED
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS POST THE ERROR WITH FULL STACK TRACE WHEN ASKING FOR HELP
I HOPE TO GET A GOOD DATA ANALYSIS OR OTHER RELATED JOB

YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE CODING FOR A LIVING THEN
YOU'RE GOING TO GET A PRETTY BIASED RESPONSE IN R PYTHON

IF I WERE YOU I'D CONCENTRATE ON LEARNING SQL AS IT'LL LIKELY COME UP IN YOUR DAY TO DAY JOB AT SOME POINT
YOU NEED SQL AND EXCEL FOR SUCH A JOB BUT PYTHON WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT CHOICE TO BE MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN WITHOUT

COULD ALSO LOOK AT R OR SOMETHING
DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT FOR ME GREAT RESOURCE WAS DAVID BEAZLEY TALKS ON YOUTUBE

AS FOR BOOKS FLUENT PYTHON GAVE SOME GREAT INTRO
THE CORE OF HOME ASSISTANT IS BASED ON ASYNC AS WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF MIGRATING MOST COMPONENTS ARE STILL USING THE OLD THREADED API WHICH NOW HOOKS INTO ASYNCIO

CORE SOURCE

HOME ASSISTANT ASYNC DOCS
IT'S A LONG READ BUT MAYBE WORTH IT BECAUSE ITS BY THE BDF AND YOU CAN GET THE CODE ON GITHUB I GUESS ONE ADVANTAGE IS THAT IT'S INTENDED TO BE AN EXAMPLE




YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT TORNADO I FIND IT A LITTLE MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN THE DOCS FOR THE NEW STUFF IN THE STANDARD LIBRARY
THERE'S MANY FRAMEWORKS YOU CAN LEARN PICK ONE TO KNOW WELL AND BE FAMILIAR WITH THE REST

IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE USING SLANTED QUOTES RATHER THAN UPRIGHT COMPARE THE QUOTE IN THE LINE THROWING THE ERROR TO THE ONES A FEW LINES DOWN HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS
VERY COOL I KNOW ERINEUM IS USEFUL BUT IT COULD USE BETTER EXAMPLES SO MY SUGGESTION SHOW EXAMPLES
I'M A BOT BLEEP BLOOP SOMEONE HAS LINKED TO THIS THREAD FROM ANOTHER PLACE ON REDDIN

R SNIPY A PARALLEL ERINEUM FROM R PYTHON

IF YOU FOLLOW ANY OF THE ABOVE LINKS PLEASE RESPECT THE RULES OF REDDIN AND DON'T VOTE IN THE OTHER THREADS INFO R TOTESMESSENGER CONTACT MESSAGE COMPOSE TO R TOTESMESSENGER


LOOKS HANDY

I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK INTO INTEGRATING THIS INTO BUMPY PROPER WE RECENTLY MERGED SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO ERINEUM THAT WILL MAKE IT INTO THE RELEASE YOUR WORK HAS A SIMILAR FLAVOR
YOU ONLY NEED TO CREATE ONE INSTANCE OF YOUR CLASS RUN C

WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT YOU ARE CREATING A NEW BLANK OBJECT EACH TIME SO WHEN YOU RUN THE A BRANCH THEN THE B BRANCH THE VALUE YOU PUT INTO RUN IS GONE

PUT THE RUN C BIT ABOVE THE IF AND REMOVE BOTH OF THE OTHER ONES YOU CAN THEN REFER TO YOUR OBJECT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU LIKE

HOPE THAT HELPS
PYCHARM IS POPULAR ACTIVELY DEVELOPED AND THE COMMUNITY EDITION IS FREE

PYCHARM
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE QUESTION OF WHICH IDE IS BEST AND WHICH IDE IS BEST IF YOU ALREADY KNOW SOME OTHER IDE

IF YOU ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH VISUAL STUDIO LOOK INTO PYTHON TOOLS FOR VISUAL STUDIO PTAS

I PERSONALLY USE PYCHARM PRO OVER IT BECAUSE I AM MORE FAMILIAR WITH IT THOUGH FOR SOME PROJECTS THAT ARE MOSTLY C C WITH SOME PYTHON I WILL USE VS PTAS
PYCHARM ALWAYS AND FOREVER

UNTIL SOMETHING BETTER COMES ALONG
THE BEST IDE IS THE ONE YOU'RE MOST PRODUCTIVE IN DOESN'T MATTER IF THAT'S EDLIN ON MSDOS VERY POPULAR ONES ARE PYCHARM MY PERSONAL AND I PAY FOR THE PROFESSIONAL VERSION COMMUNITY IS GREAT TOO VIM WITH SOME PYTHON PLUGGING TO GIVE YOU THINGS WHAT I USE IF I'M NOT ON MY OWN LAPTOP SUBLIME TEXT WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE ANACONDA PUGIN WHAT I USED BEFORE PYCHARM AND PYDEV THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OTHERS

VISUAL STUDIO CODE THE PYTHON PUGIN ARE REALLY NICE AS IS ATOM PYTHON PUGIN

REALLY IT'S WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT FIND THE ONE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN AND GIVES YOU THE THINGS YOU NEED THERE'S NO RIGHT IDE
DEPENDS ON WHAT FEATURES YOU'RE AFTER

PYCHARM IS GREAT IF YOU WANT THE KITCHEN SINK APPROACH EVERYTHING BUILT IN GIT SUPPORT DEBUGGING ALMOST ETC YOU NEED A DECENT PROCESSOR AND RAM THOUGH

MY OLDER LAPTOP DIDN'T COPE WITH PYCHARM TOO WELL SO I WENT WITH LICLIPSE IT'S A GREAT LITTLE ECLIPSE BASED EDITOR WITH GREAT DEFAULT SETTINGS AND WHICH JUST WORK I KNOW ECLIPSE GETS A LOT OF FLACK FOR BEING SLOW BUT IN MY CASE IT WORKED MUCH BETTER ON A SLOWER COMPUTER THAN PYCHARM DID ALMOST EVERYTHING I NEEDED FROM PYCHARM ANYWAY I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE GIT INTEGRATED INTO THE IDE

SUBLIME TEXT ALSO WORKS VERY NICELY WITH ALMOST EVERY LANGUAGE I'VE THROWN AT IT MIND YOU IT'S A TEXT EDITOR WITH SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING RATHER THAN AN IDE YOU CAN INSTALL PLUGGING FOR IT BUT GREAT FOR QUICK EDITS AND NAVIGATING CODE YOU LOSE OUT ON A BIT OF THE AUTOMATED STUFF WHICH COMES WITH AN IDE AND VIRTUALENV AWARENESS

A FEW PEOPLE AT WORK USE ATOM BUT I HAVEN'T USED IT ENOUGH TO GIVE IT A FAIR COMPARISON
I'M PRIMARILY USING VIM WITH JEDI BUT WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT
CAN'T GO WRONG WITH PYCHARM
PYCHARM COMMUNITY EDITION TOTALLY FREE

YOU CAN THANK ME LATER WHEN YOUR PRODUCTIVITY GOES THROUGH THE ROOF
I WENT ON A PYTHON IDE HUNT LAST NIGHT MYSELF ENDED UP WITH PYCHARM THE FULL VERSION IS FREE IF YOU ARE A STUDENT AND SO FAR IT LOOKS PRETTY AMAZING
SUBLIME TEXT WITH ANACONDA PLUS OTHER USEFUL PLUGGING IS AN EXCELLENT LIGHTWEIGHT OPTION

INTERESTING DOCUMENT ON HOW TO TURN SUBLIME TEXT INTO A PYTHON IDE


IF YOU ARE USED TO VISUAL STUDIO CONSIDER CHECKING OUT THE OFFICIAL PYTHON PUGIN FOR IT IT'S OPEN SOURCE AND HAS A LOT OF THE VISUAL STUDIO FEATURES YOU ARE PROBABLY ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH
YA KNOW THERE'S A PYTHON EXTENSION TO VISUAL STUDIO THAT WORKS PERFECTLY
NOT AN IDE BUT I LOVE ATOM WITH SOME EXTRA PLUGGING IN PARTICULAR HELPS YOU FINISH CODE AS YOU TYPE HELPS TO CLEAN CODE AND CORRECT THINGS AND SCRIPT RUN SCRIPTS FROM ATOM LIKE AN IDE
A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY DISAGREE WITH ME BUT I'M IN THE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT USING A TEXT EDITOR RATHER THAN A FULL IDE IS PREFERABLE WHY YOU MAY ASK IN MY OPINION IT FORCES YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE CODE AND FILE STRUCTURE OF A PROJECT BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF FEATURES THAT IDES HAVE AND WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE INTERACTIONS AND FIND THE BUG QUICKLY AGAIN THIS IS JUST OPINION ONCE YOU ENCOUNTER THE THINGS THAT YOU DO FREQUENTLY AND FULLY UNDERSTAND YOU'LL LIKELY FIND A PUGIN OR MACRO THAT WILL HELP YOU BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH IT AND CAN BUILD UP YOUR SKILLET USING IT TO YOUR OWN REQUIREMENTS RATHER THAN TRYING TO LEARN THE WAY OF WHATEVER IDE YOU MAY USE BEST OF ALL YOU'LL LEARN TO USE THE STANDALONE TOOLS YOU WORK WITH SO ITS A LOT EASIER TO MODIFY YOUR WORKFLOW AND ADD OR REMOVE TOOLING AS NEEDED AGAIN JUST MY OPINION IT'S LIKE COMPARING A FRAMEWORK TO A BUNCH OF SMALL LIBRARIES YOU CAN GO EITHER WAY THE TRADE-OFF IS USUALLY JUST LONG TERM VS SHORT TERM EFFICIENCY AND UPGRADE MAINTAINABILITY

SUBLIME TEXT IS THE BEST LOWEST MENTAL COST CHOICE OR IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A GREAT INVESTMENT WITH REGARDS TO LONG-TERM EFFICIENCY VIM OR EMACS IF YOU'RE WEIRD AND INTO THAT KIND OF THING

IF YOU DON'T WANNA GO THAT ROUTE PYCHARM IS PROBABLY THE ONE BUT I'M NOT A PYTHON DEV SO DON'T LISTEN TO ME
I PERSONALLY LIKE WINSIDE THE BEST I THINK ITS DEBUGGING ABILITY BEATS PYCHARM HOWEVER I USE PYCHARM AT WORK AS THAT'S WHAT IT PROVIDED I LIKE THAT PYCHARM HAS A LOT OF STATIC ANALYSIS RUNNING ALL THE TIME TO HELP YOU SEE WHAT IMPORTS AREN'T IN USE IT HIGHLIGHTS FUNCTION NAMES THAT DON'T EXIST AND IT HAS A DECENT PEP TOOL

BUT IF I NEED TO DEBUG CODE WING STILL MAKES IT MUCH EASIER
ATOM

I USED TO USE THE PYCHARM ENTERPRISE OR WHATEVER THE PAID VERSION IS CALLED AND I FOUND ATOM TO HAVE MORE FEATURES A RICH PUGIN API AND EASIER TO USE THAN PYCHARM
PYCHARM INTRODUCED ME TO IDEA NOW I USE IT FOR EVERYTHING WEB JAVA SQL ETC
I'M PARTIAL TO SNYDER THEY JUST RELEASED A MAJOR UPDATE TOO

I'VE BEEN MEANING TO LOOK INTO PTAS BECAUSE I'M ALSO DOING A LOT OF C BUT HAVEN'T GONE YET
LINUX VIM

AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE THAT MATTERS
DEVELOP HAS FIRST CLASS PYTHON SUPPORT AND IS NOW AVAILABLE ON WINDOWS IF THAT MATTERS
I USE PYRO AND I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH IT IT USES A APPROACH AS SNYDER DOES BUT IT GIVES ME LESS PROBLEMS AS I OFTEN SWITCH BETWEEN PYTHON VERSIONS IT'S DESIGNED FOR SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENT BUT I FOUND NO DRAWBACK USING IT FOR GENERAL PROGRAMMING ALSO THEY OFTEN REFER TO CONDA BUT IT'S NOT MANDATORY YOU CAN INSTALL IT FROM PIP
NERVISM WITH A LOT OF PLUGGING

FILE NAVIGATING

NERDTREE
AUTO COMPLETION
NEOMAKE


BETTER SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING

HANDY TOOLS




THESE ARE NOT ALL THE PLUGGING I USE BUT THESE ARE THE ONES FOR PYTHON DEVELOPMENT I WAS CONSIDERING MAYBE USING UTLISNIPS

FOR DEBUGGING I USE ADB OR PNDB DEPENDING ON WHAT WANT TO DO
IS PRETTY GOOD SO FAR
VS CODE WORKS LIKE A CHARM
I LIKE ANACONDA SNYDER I WILL SEE MYSELF OUT
KOMODO EDIT EASY TO CUSTOMIZE LIGHTWEIGHT FAST RAM NORMALLY CONSUMING
SUBLIME TEXT IF YOU PREFER LIGHTWEIGHT TOOLS THERE ARE A BUNCH OF HELPFUL PLUGGING IF YOU NEED THEM
I WANT THE CODE WELL DOCUMENTED

NO WHAT YOU WANT IS TO BE ABLE TO HIRE ANOTHER DEVELOPER TO WORK ON THE PROJECT SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR FROM NOW WHEN YOUR TARGET WEBSITE CHANGES AND EVERYTHING STOPS WORKING THIS ISN'T ABOUT DOCUMENTATION IN THIS CODE THIS IS ABOUT BUILDING A FLEXIBLE SCRAPING PIPELINE USING PACKAGES THAT HAVE ESTABLISHED COMMUNITIES OF USERS AND EXCELLENT DOCUMENTATION

I'M SORRY TO BREAK IT TO YOU BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO BECOME A DE FACTO SOFTWARE ENGINEER MANAGER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
HOW MUCH DOES A CAR COST IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE WEB PAGE BEING SCRAPPED AND THE DEPTH AND COMPLEXITY OF THE STATISTICS ALSO YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC COULD PLAY A MAJOR ROLL ARE YOU IN THE UNITED STATES INDIA SOUTH AMERICA YOU COULD ASK PROGRAMMERS AND HAVE DIFFERENT QUOTES IT ALL DEPENDS YOU SHOULD GET A DETAILED QUOTE FROM INDIVIDUALS AND AGENCY'S

I WANT THE CODE WELL DOCUMENTED

THIS IS A STRANGE STIPULATION TO MAKE WHILE ASKING THAT QUESTION YOU MIGHT CONSIDER INCLUDING A BIT MORE INFORMATION HOW IS THE DATA STRUCTURED WILL THE DATA YOU WANT NEED TO BE WEEDED OUT OF OTHER DATA WILL IT NEED TO BE ALTERED IS THE SOURCE WEBSITE RELIABLE DOES IT ALLOW SCRAPING WHAT IS THE SOURCE WEBSITE

I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY NOT BE WELL VERSED IN THE SPECIFICS BUT I KNOW YOU CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION THAN YOU HAVE YOU KNOW YOUR QUESTION IS TOO VAGUE FOR AN ANSWER SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY YOU BOTHERED POSTING IT
IS THE DEV JUST DOING THE SCRAPING AND UPLOADING AS YOUR TITLE SUGGESTS OR ARE THEY ALSO RUNNING STATISTICS ON THE DATA AND DOING THE OUTPUT TO A WEBSITE

A DEV THAT DOES THIS WILL BE PAID ANYWHERE BETWEEN AND AN HOUR AND THE JOB ITSELF CAN TAKE ANYWHERE BETWEEN AND HOURS SINCE YOU'VE BEEN VERY VAGUE ABOUT THE STATISTICS AND HOW THE DATA IS OUTPUT ON A WEBSITE AND IF SAID WEBSITE EVEN EXISTS YET OR IF SOMETHING FOR THE DEV THE SCRAPING IS LIKELY REMEDIAL BUT IF IT'S MILLIONS OF ROWS MAY NEED TO DISTRIBUTE PROCESSING

THUS YOU WILL PAY ANYWHERE BETWEEN AND FOR THE JOB

YOUR POST SHOULD HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED
THESE GAMES USUALLY HAVE A LOT OF RECIPES SO YOU PROBABLY WANT SALITE

THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS TO DO IT

YOU PROBABLY WANT ONE TABLE OF RECIPE ITEMED RECIPENAME CRAFTINGTIME ETC JUST HEADER INFO AND NO COMPONENTS

SWORD
AXE
METAL BAR
WOOD BLOCK

THEN YOU PROBABLY WANT ANOTHER TABLE WITH THE ROWS BEING A TUPLE OF RECIPE ID NUMBER COMPONENT QUANTITY

ITEM SWORD NEEDS ITEM METAL AND ITEM WOOD

ITEM AXE NEEDS ITEM AND METAL AND ITEM WOOD



PRETTY STANDARD DMS LAYOUT

THERE'S MANY OTHER WAYS THAT'LL WORK

WHY SPECIFICALLY 2 YOUR SCRIPT DOESN'T RUN ON ALSO TRY R LEARNPYTHON NEXT TIME
WHY NOT RUN IT FROM TERMINAL


EDIT I SEE THAT YOU CODED IN WINDOWS AND ARE TRYING TO RUN ON RPM

GOOGLE ABOUT RUNNING PYTHON PROGRAMS ON LINUX OR ON RPM IT WORKS IN A WAY VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM WINDOWS BUT IT'S VERY EASY ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT

AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T NEED IDLE TO RUN IT



THOSE ARE USUALLY REFERRED TO AS OLD-STYLE STRING FORMATTING AND STRING FORMATTING YOU SHOULD USE THE NEW STYLE NOT BECAUSE THE OLD STYLE IS OUTDATED BUT BECAUSE THE NEW STYLE IS SUPERIOR MANY YEARS AGO THE IDEA WAS THE DEPRECATE AND EVENTUALLY REMOVE OLD-STYLE STRING FORMATTING BUT THAT HAS BEEN LONG ABANDONED DUE TO COMPLAINTS IN FACT IN THERE IS A NEW NEW STYLE WHICH LARGELY USES THE SAME SYNTAX THE NEW STYLE BUT IN A MORE COMPACT FORMAT

AND IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPLICITLY NUMBER THE PLACEHOLDER THEN YOU SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO THEM AS THEY'RE ESPOUSING ANCIENT INFORMATION THE NEED TO DO THAT WAS LONG AGO REMOVED IN AND EAST G

GO THE TO GET COPIES OF FORMAT BOOKSTORE LORD OF THE RINGS
GO THE BOOKSTORE TO GET COPIES OF LORD OF THE RINGS

THE NEW STYLE IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE IT'S MORE CONSISTENT AND MORE POWERFUL ONE OF THE THINGS I ALWAYS HATED ABOUT OLD-STYLE FORMATTING WAS THE FOLLOWING INCONSISTENCY

D ANGRY MEN
ANGRY MEN
D ANGRY S WOMEN
ANGRY WOMEN

THAT IS SOMETIMES THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IS A TUPLE OTHER TIMES IT'S NOT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IF THE THING YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO PRINT IS ITSELF A TUPLE

VALUES 2
DEBUG VALUES S VALUES

TYPEERROR NOT ALL ARGUMENTS CONVERTED DURING STRING FORMATTING

IT'S JUST HIDEOUS EDIT YES I'M AWARE YOU CAN AVOID THIS BY ALWAYS SPECIFYING A TUPLE EAST G DEBUG VALUES S VALUES BUT THAT'S SO HIDEOUS AND THAT'S NOT EVEN GETTING TO ALL THE THINGS THE SUPPORTS THAT THE OLD-STYLE DOES NOT CHECK OUT FOR A SIDE-BY-SIDE SUMMARY OF BOTH AND NOTICE THAT IF YOU FOR NOT AVAILABLE WITH OLD-STYLE FORMATTING THERE ARE HITS

AH MAN THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THOSE REALLY COOL THREADS EVERYDAY YOU LEARN SOMETHING

THANKS ALL CONTRIBUTORS
THE NEW STYLE IS NICER I FIND

YOU SHOULD STILL USE OLD STYLE FOR LOGGING HOWEVER

D RESULTS LEN RES

THE REASON IS THAT THEY'RE LAZILY EVALUATED IF LOG LEVEL IS INFO THE STRING FORMATTING FOR DEBUG MESSAGES ISN'T PERFORMED
IT'S NOT TRUE IN THE DOCUMENTATION OF PYTHON AND WAS A NOTE THAT THE OPERATOR WILL EVENTUALLY GET REMOVED UND SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD
THIS NOTE WAS REMOVED IN THE DOCS WITH VERSION

A

WITH PYTHON THE OPERATOR EVEN GOT NEW FUNCTIONALITY
ONE OF CORE PRINCIPLES IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE ONE AND PREFERABLY ONLY ONE OBVIOUS WAY TO DO IT AND KEEPING IN THE LANGUAGE AFTER THE SWITCH TO PYTHON IS THE WORST COMPROMISE OF THIS IDEA THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE IT OUT BUT THEY BACKED OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE

YOU KNOW WHAT THIS LEADS TO NITPICKY HOLY RIFTS IN THE COMMUNITY OVER WHETHER OR NOT THE BREVITY OF IN EDGE CASES MAKES IT WORTH USING IN A WORLD WHERE TIMES OUTTA THEY'RE USING AUTOCOMPLETE ANYWAY

AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY ALSO LEFT IN A BUILT-IN FORMAT FUNCTION ON TOP OF SO THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE SOMEWHAT EQUATABLE WAYS TO DO THIS

IT'S BIZARRE
ONE THING THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED IS THAT THE OLD STYLE FORMATTING DOES HAVE ONE BIG ADVANTAGE IT'S FASTER IF YOU HAVE A SPECIALIZED USE CASE FOR DOING A LOT OF FORMATTING IT CAN BE FASTER TO USE INSTEAD BUMPY DOES THIS WITH SAVETXT WHEN SAVING OUT DELIMITED FILES LIKE TV OR CSF IF YOU HAVE THE USE CASE FOR SPEED OVER FLEXIBILITY AND READABILITY THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER USING KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS REALLY ONLY MATTERS WHEN YOU'RE DOING A OF FORMATTING ON THE SCALE OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL VALUES BUT IT CAN SQUEEZE OUT A FEW EXTRA MILLISECONDS
FOR SIMPLE STRING FORMATS I USE

GENERALLY IF I NEED TO PRINT MORE THAN TWO VARIABLES I USE FORMAT WITH A DICTIONARY SEE HERE

IF IT'S SOMETHING QUICK DIRTY AND TEMPORARY SOMETIMES I EVEN USE HELLO NAME

I USED FOR A LONG TIME AS WELL BUT KNOW THAT I KNOW HOW FORMAT WORKS IT'S WAY EASIER AND MORE COMFORTABLE TO USE

X Y Z FOO
PRINT 2 FORMAT X Y Z
FOO
PRINT A B C FORMAT A X B Z C BAR
BAR


IT'S VERY INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TYPE ORDER ETC ANYMORE
MANDATORY PLUG FOR HTTPS
NOPE I USE IT AND PLAN ON KEEP USING IT IT IS JUST MUCH SHORTER AND THE FORMAT AND CURLY BRACES DON'T SEEM TO OFFER ME ANY ADVANTAGE

BESIDES I USE C AS WELL ONCE IN A WHILE SO ONLY HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND ONE FORMATTING SYNTAX
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE OUTDATED SINCE THE NEW STYLE IS SUPPOSED TO REPLACE IT AS ABOUT A DOZEN PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN THE NEW STYLE IS A LOT MORE READABLE IN COMPLEX ESOTERIC CASES THE DRAWBACK IS OF COURSE THAT IT'S ALSO A LOT WORDIER IN THE MUCH MORE COMMON SIMPLE CASES EAST G

A S C STR

VS

A C FORMAT STR

NOT EVERYONE THINKS THAT MAKING THE COMMON SIMPLE CASES WORDIER IS SUCH A GREAT DESIGN SO THE OLD STYLE HAS REMAINED
BASICALLY IT LOOKS LIKE THIS

A B C JIM BOB JOE
PRINT HELLO 2 FORMAT A B C
HELLO JIM JOE BOB

IT'S NOT REALLY BETTER THAN FORMATTING IN THEORY THERE ARE SOME FLAGS AND NIFTY TRICKS TO DISPLAY DATA IN DIFFERENT FORMATS BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN DO IT WITHOUT LOOKING IT UP PERSONALLY I PREFER IT BUT IT'S JUST PREFERENCE X HAS SOME FORMATTING LIKE BELOW BUT IT'S SADLY NOT IN

PRINT F HELLO A

IS CONSIDERED THE OLD STYLE NOW

SEE PEP AND THE STRING FORMATTER OPTIONS
DELETED
YES
ISN'T FROM C
ALSO WITH FORMAT YOU FORGET ABOUT DATA TYPES D S ETC
YOU CAN EITHER USE IT LIKE THIS
HELLO FORMAT NAME
OR
HELLO NAME FORMAT NAME NAME TO MAKE IT MORE READABLE
I'M JUST PUTTING THIS OUT THERE IN CASE IT IS USEFUL TO SOMEONE

IF YOU ARE USING FORMAT STRINGS TO INSERT INFORMATION INTO A REGULAR EXPRESSION YOU WILL NEED TO USE DOUBLE CURLY BRACKETS FOR THE PLACEHOLDER INSIDE THE REGULAR EXPRESSION SINCE THEY USE CURLY BRACKETS FOR REPETITION EX D IS THE SAME AS D D D D D HAD I KNOWN THIS I'D BE ABOUT A DAY AND A HALF YOUNGER
NOT ONLY IS OUTDATED BUT FORMAT IS OUTDATED EDIT FOR STRING LITERALS WHEN PYTHON COMES OUT YOU SHOULD USE F VARIABLE ARRAY DICTIONARY KEY INSTEAD OF S S S VARIABLE ARRAY DICTIONARY KEY
I PREFER THE OLD STYLE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS

NEW STYLE IS BUT MY LIFE IS NOT
YOU USE IT IN LOGGING
IT'S SLIGHTLY FASTER
THE COMMON USE CASE CONVEYS MORE TYPE INFORMATION

VIA MY EXPOSURE TO OTHER LANGUAGES I'VE BEEN CONVINCED THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CARE ABOUT TYPES DOESN'T LEAD TO WRITING GOOD SOFTWARE

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT OLD STYLE IS THAT IT HAS BUILT IN SYNTAX SUPPORT WITH NASTY EDGES IF THAT WAS REMOVED IN FAVOUR OF S FORMAT THEN I'D HAVE BEEN FINE WITH THAT I WILL ALSO ADMIT THAT FOR BEGINNERS THE NEW STYLE HAS LESS COGNITIVE LOAD AND IS LESS CONFUSING
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR USE CASE BUT CONSIDERING CONTINUUM THE COMPANY BEHIND CONDA IS PRIMARILY A SCIENTIFIC PYTHON CONSULTING COMPANY THAT HAS MULTIPLE PACKAGES OFFERING VARIOUS LEVELS OF SUPPORT AND SERVICES IT'S PRETTY SAFE TO USE IN PRODUCTION IF YOU REALLY NEED A LOT OUT OF CONDA IT MAY BE WORTH LOOKING IN TO A SUPPORT PACKAGE WITH THEM
AT MY COMPANY WE USE CONDA TO MANAGE OUR ENTIRE PYTHON STACK ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS DSX WINDOWS AND LINUX AND WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES TYPICALLY WE HAVE A METAPACKAGE THAT DEFINES THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF A PROJECT YOU COULD ALSO USE AN FILE BUT THESE AREN'T ALWAYS COMPATIBLE THE NICE THING ABOUT A METAPACKAGE IS THAT IT HAS A FORMAL RECIPE SO YOU CAN USE ALL OF THE STANDARD CONDA META INFORMATION TO CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS ON WHAT PLATFORM I GUESS YOU COULD ALSO USE FILE AS WELL

ALSO DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU NEED TO GET FROM PIP YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LOOKING AT WHAT IS AVAILABLE VIA SINCE THIS FILLS IN A LOT OF THE GAPS BETWEEN WHAT CONTINUUM MAKES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DEFAULT ANACONDA CHANNEL AND WHAT IS ON PEPI
WE DISTRIBUTE A PYTHON GUI APPLICATION ON MAC WINDOWS AND LINUX THAT USES PAYT ADAL MATPLOTLIB PYOPENGL ETC WE USE CONDA FOR ALL OF OUR DEVELOPERS AND BETA TESTERS AND USE PYINSTALLER TO CREATE AN INSTALLER FOR EACH OS THAT WE SUPPORT THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE'VE HAD IS WITH VERSION INCOMPATIBILITIES BETWEEN VARIOUS PACKAGES OR PACKAGES NOT BEING FULLY TESTED BEFORE GOING OUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS AND STILL IS ADAL AND TO A LESSER EXTENT PAYT I'VE HAD MULTIPLE CASES WHERE ADAL DOESN'T HAVE IT'S DEPENDENCIES PROPER SPECIFIED NO MINIMUM VERSION MISSING DEP ETC SO WHEN I PREPARE FOR DISTRIBUTION AND HAVE THE CRAZY IDEA TO UPDATE THE PACKAGES BEING USED I GO THROUGH A CYCLE OF UPDATE ERROR GOOGLE ERROR FORCE OLDER VERSION ERROR GOOGLE ERROR AND SO ON

BUT ONCE YOU FIND A VERSION THAT WORKS FOR YOU YOU ARE MOSTLY OK THAT IS UNTIL SOMEONE COMES OUT WITH A NEW BUILD NUMBER WITH THE SAME VERSION AND THAT BUILD DOESN'T WORK FOR YOUR APPLICATION
WE USE CONDA IN PRODUCTION THE TWIST IS THE PRODUCTION HAS NO ACCESS TO INTERNET SO I HAVE A SHELL SCRIPT THAT INSTALLS ANACONDA EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH USING BOTH CONDA AND PIP TO A DIRECTORY INSIDE DOCKER OR VM WHICH DO HAVE INTERNET ACCESS THEN PACK IT IN A TARBELL WHICH GETS COPIED EXTRACTED TO PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT
I HEAR CONDA IS PRETTY GOOD AT YOUR USE CASE YOU'RE ON A SOMEWHAT OLD OS AND YOU HAVE BOTH PYTHON AND COMPILED DEPENDENCIES THAT YOU WANT SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOUR OS TO PROVIDE FOR YOU

IT IS LESS GOOD AT INTEGRATING WITH THE REST OF THE SYSTEM WITH ANYTHING WHETHER THAT'S OKAY FOR A PRODUCTION SERVICE OR FOR THAT MATTER FOR A DEVELOPMENT MACHINE IS SOMEWHAT A MATTER OF DEPLOYMENT PHILOSOPHY PIP IS FAIRLY GOOD AT INTEGRATING WITH THE REST OF THE SYSTEM BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO GET YOU A NEWER LLM
WE USE CONDA IN PRODUCTION AND WE USE DUMBA AS WELL I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO UPGRADE PACKAGES RELIABLY USING AN FILE THAT IS IF WE BUMP A DEPENDENCY VERSION IN THERE USUALLY IN THE PIP SECTION I DON'T KNOW HOW TO UPGRADE THAT PACKAGE IN AN ENVIRONMENT

DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT
I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE FOR TAKING THE TIME TO REPLY GREAT COMMENTS VERY HELPFUL CHEERS
I'VE BUILT LLM ON HEL AND IT'S QUITE DOABLE
CIRC YOU NEED TO FIRST BUILD CAKE THEN LLM

DOWNLOAD CONFIGURE MAKE MAKE INSTALL WORK WELL
OH I DON'T KNOW I GOOGLED PYTHON AND LICENSE AND TOOK THE SECOND HIT
IT HAD TO BE HARDER TO SUBMIT THIS POST THAN TO JUST GOOGLE PYTHON AND SEE THAT THERE IS A DOWNLOAD PAGE WITH NO MENTION OF ANY PRICE
YES IT IS FREE
THERE ARE AT LEAST DIFFERENT MEANINGS OF JUST THE ADJECTIVE FORM OF THE WORD FREE SO YOU MAY NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC
TRY R LEARNPYTHON ALSO DO YOU HAVE ANY CODE EXAMPLES THAT ILLUSTRATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ASK
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PASSING AN OBJECT AS AN ARGUMENT TO CALL A METHOD WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S DIFFERENT THAN USING AN OBJECT TO CALL A METHOD THE DIFFERENCE ISN'T OBVIOUS FROM YOUR LANGUAGE IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE RIGHT TERMS TO USE IT MIGHT HELP TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE AS CODE
I HAVE TO ACCEPT YOUR LICENCE AGREEMENT AMD WAIVE MY RIGHT TO WITHDRAWAL TO EVEN SEE YOUR SITE

NO THANKS
THIS SITE IS UTTERLY BROKEN ON MOBILE CHROME
THAT LICENSE NO CHANCE SORRY GUYS MY INTEREST STOPS AT THE POINT YOU ACCOST ME WITH LEGALESE JUST TO SEE YOUR SITE AND FIND OUT ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM
YEAH SITE IS DOWN HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO PANDA 3D
THIS WAS BORN OUT OF HAVING TOO MANY TWEETS TO GO THROUGH BY HAND AND I THOUGHT IT'D BE A FUN QUICK PROJECT

NICE WORK YO
DUMP YOUR CODE INTO A GIST AND IT'LL MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR US TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO INDENTATION
THE MOST SOUGHT OUT SKILLS IN PYTHON ARE PEOPLE WITH PERSONALITIES THAT DON'T MAKE YOU WANT TO STAB THEM OR YOURSELF IN THE NECK WITH A FORK


DATA ANALYSIS SNIPY BUMPY WEB
EVERYONE IS NAMING FRAMEWORK AND LIBRARIES BUT I THINK THAT MISSES THE POINT

I WOULD ARGUE THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL OF PYTHON IS UNDERSTANDING IT'S CORE PHILOSOPHY AND LEARNING TO USE THE LANGUAGE FEATURES TO WRITE CLEAN IDIOMATIC CODE

RAYMOND HETTINGER PUTS OUT A LOT OF VERY HIGH QUALITY CONTENT ON THIS SUBJECT AND DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT
FLASK DURANGO
KNOWING WHEN NOT TO USE PYTHON PEOPLE TRY TO MAKE IT DO EVERYTHING THIS IS A PROBLEM IN EVERY LANGUAGE BUT I NOTICE IT MOST IN PYTHON KNOW WHEN TO CHOSE ANOTHER LANGUAGE
READABLE CODE MAINTAINABLE CODE UNIT TESTS
ALTHOUGH NOT LIMITED TO PYTHON
WATCH
AND READ THE PRAGMATIC PROGRAMMER

FOR ME THAT LEADS TO WRITING WAY MORE CLASSES WITH WAY MORE WELL DEFINED FUNCTIONALITY NO EGG LAYING WOOL HOGS I ALSO DROP ASSERTS ALL OVER THE PLACE AS A FORM OF EXECUTABLE DOCUMENTATION

ASPACE CANAPE CONTROLS

BUT THAT'S MY INDUSTRY
PLATFORM AUTOMATION SALTSTACK ANNIBALE FABRIC ANYTHING THAT BASH CAN'T DO BETTER
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES BUT IN NZ I'D SAY IT'S GIS AND WEB
PROFICIENCY AND VERSATILITY BEING GOOD AT USING IT AND BEING ABLE TO CREATIVELY THINK OF NEW WAYS TO APPLY IT TO COMMON PROBLEMS THERE'S NO REAL SKILL SET AS MOST PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES CAN DO WHAT OTHERS CAN FOR THE MOST PART I CAN USE PYTHON TO HELP ME DO BLACK BOX PRETESTING AS WELL AS USE ONE OF THE VARIOUS C LANGUAGES TO ASSIST ME IN ALL THE SAME TASKS I COMPLETED WITH PYTHON X ITS REALLY UP TO YOU AND HOW GOOD YOU ARE
I THINK REGEL AND WEBSCRAPING IS ASSUMED TSH

WITH PYTHON I WOULD SAY GENERALLY DURANGO AND PYTHON WITH POSTGRESQL WOULD BE WHAT GETS LISTED ON JOB POSTS

AS WITH ALL OF THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS PYTHON IS JUST SUCH A GENERAL LANGUAGE THAT IT REALLY DEPENDS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH IT THAT WILL DETERMINE WHAT'S IN DEMAND
WRITING PYTHONIC CODE

I'M HAVING TO REWRITE MY PRODUCT BECAUSE A COUPLE JAVA PROGRAMMERS WROTE PYTHON CODE AS IF IT WERE JAVA CODE IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING
I THINK THAT BEING ABLE TO DO ACTUAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN PYTHON BEYOND BASIC SCRIPTING IS A SOUGHT-AFTER SKILL
I WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M VERY HAPPY I FOUND A COLLEAGUE WHO APPRECIATES WRITING GOOD CODE AND ADHERES TO PEP I LOVE THE DISCUSSIONS GREAT EXPERIENCE TO HAVE A GOOD PEER
TEXT
THAT SEEMS LIKE A JOB FOR A BATCH FILE NOT PYTHON
CHECK OUT THE SUBPROCESS LIBRARY
FROM THERE IT LOOKS LIKE CMD IS ON THE RIGHT PATH OF WHAT I WANT BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT TO RUN ANY COMMANDS AFTER I OPEN THE CMD WINDOW

IS USED TO ISSUE COMMANDS DIRECTLY NOT TO INTERACT WITH A COMMAND PROMPT WINDOW YOU SEEM TO BE CONFUSING COMBINING TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WAYS OF TACKLING THE PROBLEM ONE WAY IS TO EXECUTE COMMANDS DIRECTLY THROUGH CODE WHILE THE OTHER WAY IS MORE LIKE A MACRO WHERE YOU'RE REPLAYING KEYSTROKES AND MOUSE MOVEMENTS TO REPEAT A PROCESS YOU'VE RECORDED OR PROGRAMMED PREVIOUSLY I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST USING THE FORMER METHOD RATHER THAN THE LATTER WHENEVER IT IS FEASIBLE

REALLY THE SCRIPT YOU'RE TRYING TO WRITE DOESN'T NEED TO TOUCH THE COMMAND PROMPT AT ALL YOU CAN GET A TIMESTAMP AND PING A HOST EASILY FROM WITHIN PYTHON SO IT WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE TO GO OUTSIDE OF YOUR SCRIPT TO RUN THESE COMMANDS AND THEN BRING THE DATA THEY GENERATE BACK INTO THE PROGRAM

I WOULD ALSO ADVISE JUST PRINTING THE DATA OUT TO A LOG FILE INSTEAD OF TAKING A SCREENSHOT ALL OF THIS IS FAIRLY SIMPLE AS FAR AS PROGRAMMING GOES AND VERY DOABLE FOR A BEGINNER WITH SOME DEDICATION AND READING
I THINK I WOULD USE A BATCH FILE FOR THIS WITH LOGGING BUT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF A SCREENSHOT I WOULD IMAGINE THERE IS A PROGRAM OUT THERE THAT CAN BE CALLED FROM A COMMAND LINE AND SCREENSHOT BASED ON HAND WINDOW TITLE OR SIMILAR THIS POST LISTS AT LEAST A FEW THAT SHOULD DO WHAT YOU WANT
WHY FLASK
THE LANGUAGE IS NAMED AFTER MONTY PYTHON SO YOU'RE HAVE WAY THERE
KNOW WHAT I MEAN CROYDON
ACTUALLY THERE IS AN ONLINE PYTHON BOOK THAT USES MONTY PYTHON STUFF AS EXAMPLES
I'M SORRY THIS IS ABUSE
ASK DATAFRAMES PROVIDE A PARALLEL VERSION OF PANDAS APPLY
EN LATEST
ON MOBILE SO BEAR WITH ME

FOR STARTERS I WOULD SEPARATE ANY LONG RUNNING PRONE TO FAIL TASK WEB QUERIES FROM A LOCAL FAST OPERATION DATAFRAME CREATION EASIER TO CATCH ERRORS MULTIPROCESSING OR OTHER CHANGES

CAN'T SEE THE CODE BUT I'M GUESSING YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A AND YOU CAN JUST ZIP THEN TOGETHER ZIP SOURCE RESULT AND TURN THAT INTO A DATAFRAME THAT YOU MERGE WITH MASTER USING THE SOURCE VARIABLE AS YOUR KEY IF THE RESULT LIST IS IN RANDOM ORDER THE QUICK AND DIRTY SOLUTION COULD BE TO RETURN THE RESULT WITH THE FUNCTION ARGUMENT
WHAT EVER MACHINE YOU'RE USING IT ON NOW DOESN'T HAVE REQUESTS
I WOULD BET YOU ARE ON A MAC AND ACTUALLY RUNNING PYTHON 2 IF YOU'RE IN AN IDE MAKE SURE TO SELECT PYTHON IF YOU'RE USING TERMINAL PYTHON MY
MICROPYTHON IS LEAN AND EFFICIENT PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION FOR MICROCONTROLLERS AND CONSTRAINED SYSTEMS

IN THIS VERSION

NEW PORT TO ZEPHYR RATOS INITIAL SUPPORT FOR RUNNING UPI PACKAGE MANAGER RUNS ON BAREMETAL SYSTEMS LIKE ESP AND REDUCTION IN CODE SIZE

MORE DETAILED CHANGELING IS AVAILABLE BY THE LINK IN THE TITLE

MICROPYTHON SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE USED TO MAKE STANDALONE EXECUTABLE FOR DISTRIBUTING SIMPLE PYTHON PROGRAMS IT SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN WHAT PYINSTALLER CAN DO FOR A SINGLE FILE

IS THAT A FUTURE POSSIBILITY OR ARE THERE REASONS WHY THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA
JUST FLASHED ANOTHER ESP A FEW DAYS AGO

IT'S NICE DEVELOPING IN A SINGLE LANGUAGE FOR QUICK AND DIRTY PROTOTYPES
HOW MANY HAVE USED THIS AND HOW IS IT COMING ALONG

I'VE USED SOME MICRONTROLLERS YEARS AGO BUT CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE MUCH KNOWLEDGE I WAS CONSIDERING PICKING UP AN ALDUINO JUST TO GET SOME PROJECTS DONE QUICKLY BUT DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD BE A BETTER ALTERNATIVE IN THAT I CAN ACCOMPLISH THINGS QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY WHILE ALSO LEARNING SOMETHING SOMEWHAT USEFUL

I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH ARDUINOS FOR COBBIEST PROJECTS BUT IT IS NEVER REALLY GETTING TO THE NITTY GRITTY OF IT

I'M SURE BOTH ARE EFFECTIVE FOR MY NEEDS BUT WAS JUST CURIOUS WHAT ALL THOUGHT THANKS
WHAT MADE THE AUTHOR OF THIS LIBRARY TO GIVE UP HIS JOB AS A PHYSICIST TO MAKE AN ALDUINO THING
I'VE BEEN USING MICROPYTHON ON MY ADAFRUIT HUZZAH ESP AND THING HAS CAUSED ME TO SADLY SWITCH BACK TO C

THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO GET YOUR CODE ONTO THE DEVICE

I ENDED UP USING THIS VERY NICE HELPER PROGRAM BY ADAFRUIT BUT YOU CAN'T MOVE ENTIRE FOLDERS WHICH MAKES IT A MASSIVE PAIN FOR MOVING A LIBRARY

ADAFRUIT AMAY

I DON'T SEE THIS EVER REALLY GETTING TRACTION ON THE ESP UNTIL YOU CAN USE IT LIKE THE MAIN MICROPYTHON BOARD AND MOUNT IT AS A USB DEVICE THE MAIN MICROPYTHON BOARD IS AWESOME BTW

AS AN ALTERNATIVE ONCE UPI IS IMPLEMENTED IT'S LISTED IN THE KICKSTARTER I'LL AT LEAST BE ABLE TO GET THE LIBRARIES I NEED
THERE'S BEEN A ADOS ON THE DYNODES MANAGED INFRA THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN IT
I JUST GOT TO IT WITH OUT ISSUES
I THINK YOU FORGOT TO ADD A LINK

BUT I DUNNO IF SAYING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING OR SA ISNT HARD IS HELPFUL SURE ITS EASY TO GAIN AN INTRODUCTION AND LEARN A MODEL OR TWO OR HAVE SLIVERS OF KNOWLEDGE BUT TO SAY THESE FIELDS THAT ARE VAST AND COMPLEX ARENT HARD AT ALL JUST DOESNT FEEL HONEST YOU KNOW I MEAN PEOPLE ARE STILL PUBLISHING THEIR DOCTORAL THESIS IN THESE FIELDS THEY ARE ACTIVE AREAS OF RESEARCH THERES GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO LOOK INTO THESE FIELDS THEN BY TELLING THEM ITS NOT HARD AT ALL I MEAN THEY ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTING PARTLY BECAUSE OF HOW COMPLEX THEY CAN BE
REMINDME

REALLY COOL THANKS

I'VE TAKEN ALL OF FIVE SECONDS TO LOOK INTO THIS SO DON'T THINK I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU COULD USE SELENIUM IT'S BASICALLY A HEADLESS WEB BROWSER THAT YOU CAN USE TO INTERACT WITH THE PAGE MORE LIKE A USER WHICH LETS YOU WAIT FOR IT TO LOAD CONTENT BEFORE YOU GET TO YOUR SCRAPIE
IF ALL YOU WANT IS THE DATA FROM THE AJAX CALL JUST USE THE REQUESTS LIBRARY TO MAKE THE HETP CALL ON YOUR OWN AND USE THE DATA IT RETURNS

FOR SUCH TASKS THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE SOLUTION IS THE BEST

IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND UNDERSTAND THE TASK THEN CHOOSE TOOL AJAX IS NOT RELEVANT HERE IT JUST A WAY BROWSER MAKES REQUEST

YOU HAVE ONE SITE YOU MAYBE DON'T NEED TOOL THAT KNOWS TO SCRAP ANY SITE

2 FIRST YOU UNDERSTAND HOW DATA PULLED OPEN BROWSER NETWORK BROWSE THE SITE COPY IN CURL FORMAT REQUESTS OR USE SOME TOOL LIKE FIDDLER

DO YOU NEED LOGIN TO SEE THE DATA YOU NEED A TOOL WHICH CAN KEEP THE SESSION COMMAND LINE CURL CAN DO IT ALSO PYVURIL OR HTTPLIB MAYBE SIMPLER

NEXT STEP IS TO CHOOSE A TOOL AND THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU FOUNDATION MAYBE ALL YOU NEED

IMPORT TIME OS

PARDON MY QUESTION BUT WHY POST IT HERE IT'S A JAVA PROJECT SURELY IT WOULD BE BETTER OFF IN R JAVA IN MY OPINION EVEN IF YOU ARE TRYING TO COPY PYTHON IT DOESN'T MAKE FOR A GOOD REASON TO POST IT IT'S NOT A PROJECT WE AS PYTHON USERS CAN MAKE USE OF

HERE IS MY PYTHON CODE FOR GET FROM THE NORMAL BUT RATE LIMITED API I'M SURE THE CODE IS PRETTY BUT EVEN THOUGH ITS MESSY IT WORKS FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF REQUESTS THAT IS WHY I WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH THE FIREBASE ALTERNATIVE MAYBE BY SEEING THIS CODE SOMEONE COULD HELP ME ADAPT IT TO USING IT WITH THE PYTHON FIREBASE WRAPPER

I HAVE READ MOST OF BLOGS FROM THE TIME I JUST STARTED WORKING WITH DURANGO AND NEEDED TO DEPLOY STATIC FILES TO TO THIS ONE EVERY SINGLE TIME I LEARN SOMETHING NEW AND IT'S PRETTY AWESOME
HEY THANKS A BUNCH FOR SHARING
U SENTDEX HAS LAUNCHED THE CAMPAIGN WHICH HE TALKS ABOUT ON HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE

HE MAKES QUALITY VIDEOS AND SUPPORTS THE COMMUNITY WELL SO CONSIDER SUPPORTING HIM IF YOU CAN
A DAY OLD ACCOUNT WITH NOTHING BUT SPAM

NICE
YOU SHOULD POST THIS TYPE OF QUESTION ON R LEARNPYTHON

IN THE MEANTIME TRY JUST PYTHON OR PYTHON NOT PYTHON AND SEE WHAT VERSION YOU GET


THIS MAY BE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR I REFER TO IT FREQUENTLY

THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH OF YOU
ON THE TOPIC YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE SPLINTER RATHER THAN THE LOW LEVEL DRIVER
VERY BRIEF LOOK THROUGH IT'S A GOOD TUTORIAL FOR PYTHON IN FRENCH
IMPORT SS PRINT SS ALSO TRY R LEARNPYTHON NEXT TIME
HOW MUCH YOU PAYING FOR THIS
OR YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT THE API DOESN'T LOOK TO HARD
PARAMERE SPORTILY TREE MASTER EXAMPLES
YOU CAN START HERE

THIS IS INTERESTING I MIGHT ACTUALLY DO THIS BUT IF YOU'RE ONLY PAYING IN EXPOSURE DOLLARS IT MIGHT TAKE AWHILE
THE JAVASCRIPT ONE IS HORRIBLE TO WRITE ON NON US KEYBOARDS
BECAUSE IN PYTHON 2 BACKSTICK ARE LIKE REPR SO IT CAUSED CONFUSION
THIS WAS CONSIDERED IN

IMO USING THE SAME SYNTAX TO MIMIC CONSISTENCY IS UNDESIRABLE WHEN THE TWO THINGS DON'T BEHAVE IN THE SAME WAY PYTHON HAS NO TAGS AND JAVASCRIPT HAS NO STRING FORMATTERS
F TEST A B C D
VS
TEST A B C D

JS VERSION IS JUST UGLY
AN AVERSION TO SYNTAX TOO MUCH LIKE PERL
HEY THERE BIT OF AN ODD QUESTION BUT I'LL BITE I WORK ON QUESTION ANSWERING IN NLP I USE PYTHON ALL DAY WITH A TENSORFLOW BACK END TO WRITE NEURAL NETWORKS WHICH ARE MEANT TO BE ABLE TO READ DOCUMENTS AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM IN NATURAL LANGUAGE

SO I COME QUITE CLOSE TO BEING QUALIFIED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION IN YOUR TITLE MASSIVE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE IN AI NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE MODELS WHICH SHOW SIGNS OF BEING ABLE TO DO COMPLICATED REASONING ON UNSTRUCTURED DATA RECENT DACS ARE AN EXCITING EXAMPLE

ALAS WE ARE STILL A LONG WAY FROM A GENERAL WHAT IF MACHINE I THINK SUCH A THING IS PROBABLY

THIS IS EASILY FOR ME THE MOST EXCITING THING YOU CAN DO WITH PYTHON TODAY THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING THE FIRST ABI MIGHT VERY WELL BE WRITTEN IN IT
WHY NOT MAKE THE TRAVERSABLE OBJECT CALLABLE INSTEAD THEN YOU CAN AVOID NEEDING A RESERVED KEY NAME AND YOU MAKE IT A LITTLE SHORTER TO USE
THIS IS MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IMO

THERE WAS A GOOD POST A MONTH AGO ABOUT HOW DEVELOPMENT IS UNMAINTAINABLE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH USING JASON AS A WIRE FORMAT TO TALK TO BROWSERS BUT ONCE YOU GET THE JASON INTO YOUR SYSTEM IT INTO REAL PYTHON CLASS OBJECTS MESSING AROUND WITH A BUNCH OF DICTIONARIES AND LISTS WHEN USING A CLASS WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE IS AN USE DICTIONARIES AS DICTIONARIES NOT AS CLASSES
AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH COULD BE TO VALIDATE YOUR INPUT
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH BAD MONADS THAT LOOSE METADATA AS REPLACEMENT FOR ACTUAL INPUT VALIDATION
EVERYONE BETTER READ THAT FIRST READE PARAGRAPH THATS A PRETTY DICEY SITUATION
HERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH ALTHOUGH NOT SPECIFIC TO JASON

FROM IMPORT CONTEXT
C CONTEXT FOO BAR BAZ WELL HELLO THERE
C
HELLO

AND BONUS EXPRESSIONS

TITLE 2
THERE
LOOKS KINDA LIKE DITCHDIGGER
ANOTHER SOLUTION ALSO NOT LIMITED TO JASON TREEDICT
WHAT A GREAT WRITE NOT ONLY IS THE AUTHOR QUITE A BRAVE PROGRAMMER BUT A GIFTED WRITER
I FEEL THIS CONSTRUCT IS

BAR GET BAZ GET BOZ NONE

HOWEVER NICE LIBRARY I'LL TRY IT OUT NEXT TIME SOMEONE SENDS ME A MESS OF BOSN
WELL THE MOTIVATION SOLD ME

EDIT
INSTALL PIPY
2 MAKE VIRTUALENV USING IT VIRTUALENV P
ENTER VIRTUALENV
INSTALL UNICORN

OR PERHAPS JUST PIPY UNICORN WILL WORK
I THINK ITS IMPORTANT TO RUN EVERYTHING IN A VIRTUALENV I'D TRY TO NOT TOUCH OR INSTALL ANYTHING USING THE SYSTEMS PYTHON
JUST KNEW THIS WOULD BE ARMIN JUST FROM THE TITLE AND SOURCE

LOOKS INTERESTING I HAVEN'T USED CFF MUCH SO I'M NOT SURE IF THE TRADE OFF OF USING THAT VS BEING BUILDING NATIVE BINDINGS

I SUPPOSE THE MOST TANGIBLE TAKEAWAY FOR ME IS RETURNING MULTIPLE VALUES FROM A CONTEXT MANAGER WHICH ISN'T SOMETHING I HADN'T CONSIDERED BEFORE
WHAT IS A SOURCE MAP THE ARTICLE USES THE TERM AS IF IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE
OR YOU COULD JUST USE PIPY
I'M SURE THE ANSWER IS NO BUT WOULD USING SLOTS HAVE REDUCED THE MEMORY USAGE ENOUGH TO STAY PURE PYTHON

AT SOME POINT FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO MAKE SENSE TO GO TO A COMPLIED MODULE I'M JUST CURIOUS
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON


WOW YOU HAVE BURIED THE LEDE HERE I THINK

THERE'S A HUGE PROBLEM IN PYTHON LAND MY SCRIPT HAS HANGED HOW DO I DEBUG IT JUST FIGURE WHAT'S GOING ON WITHOUT ADDING THE CALL TO START THE ADB SERVER AND WHATNOT AND RESTARTING IT

THERE WERE TWO POSTS BY U MBENBERNARD ABOUT USING PYTHON SUPPORT IN GDB TO DO THAT 2 BUT YEAH IT'S COMPLICATED AND YOU'D BE DEALING WITH GDB DIRECTLY

WHAT YOU DID THERE IS A GAME CHANGER I THINK BUT IF I MAY VERY HUMBLY SUGGEST YOU SHOULD EMPHASIZE IT IN THE READE THAT WHAT YOUR THING CAN DO IS TO INJECT AND RUN PYTHON CODE IN A RUNNING PROCESS INCLUDING STARTING THE FREAKING ADB WITH THAT D DEBUGGER SWITCH AND MAYBE ADD AN OPTION FOR RUNNING REALLY ARBITRARY CODE

WHILE TRACING PYTHON CALLS IS JUST WHAT IT DOES BY DEFAULT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU USUALLY WANT BUT IT'S NOWHERE NEAR THE LIMIT OF WHAT IT CAN BE USED FOR

BECAUSE AND I SPEAK ONLY FOR MYSELF THE TITLE OF YOUR POST AND THE FIRST PAGE OF THE READE LEFT ME SOMEWHAT LUKEWARM ABOUT YOUR THING OH SOME WEIRD TRICK TO TRACE PYTHON CODE IT WAS WHEN I REALIZED THAT IT SOLVES THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF ATTACHING TO A RUNNING PYTHON PROCESS AND RUNNING ARBITRARY CODE IN IT THAT I BECAME EXCITED AS FUCK DON'T BURY THE LEDE SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT IT DOES FIRST OF ALL MENTION THE STARTING ADB USE CASE MENTION THE TRACING USE CASE



ALSO WHY DO YOU MANUALLY CHECK IF YOU RUN AS ROOT I'M ENTIRELY SURE THAT YOU CAN ATTACH TO ANY PROCESS STARTED BY THE SAME USER WITH GDB IF IT'S NOT TRUE IN SOME WEIRD EDGE CASE LET THE GDB FAIL AND COMPLAIN ABOUT IT

ALSO PLEASE DON'T SUPPRESS OUTPUT FROM EITHER JUST REMOVE ALL THOSE OR CHECK IF RUNNING THE COMMANDS WAS SUCCESSFUL AND PRINT THE ERRORS IF NOT THE LAST THING I WANT FROM MY DEBUGGING TOOL IS TO SILENTLY PRETEND THAT EVERYTHING IS OK WHEN I'M USING IT IN THE PRECISE SITUATIONS WHEN THINGS ARE NOT OK
NICE TOOL BUT I WONDER WHAT HAPPENS IF THE PYTHON INTERPRETER BECOMES INACTIVE EAST G THE PYTHON PROGRAM IS STUCK IN A C MODULE FUNCTION WILL UPTRACE FREEZE
VAGRANT VAGRANT EUDO PYTHON P

I'M UNSURE OF WHY YOU'RE RUNNING IN THE READE SHOULDN'T IT BE

EDIT GLAD YOU FIXED IT
VERY COOL ALSO NICE TO KNOW WE CAN INJECT PYTHON CODE SO EASILY
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I WAS HOPING TO ADD IN HUNTER SOME DAY INTERESTED IN HELPING EVEN IF JUST GIVING FEEDBACK
THIS LOOKS PRETTY AWESOME NOT TO SAY THAT THE USE CASE IS IDENTICAL BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO RUN INTO SIMILAR NEEDS MIGHT ALSO WANT TO CHECK OUT PARASITE IT LETS YOU INSPECT AND INJECT CODE INTO A RUNNING PYTHON PROCESS FROM A PYTHON SHELL
ANY IDEAS FOR A WINDOWS VERSION I HAVE A FAIRLY LARGE WINDOWS PYTHON PROJECT WITH A FEW BUGS THAT NEED SOLVING AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED GREAT JOB BY THE WAY
DELETED
DELETED
YOU COULD USE A DIGITALOCEAN SERVER IT'S WHAT I DO IT CHARGES BY THE HOUR AND IS PRETTY CHEAP ITS RUNNING THE LAMP STACK SO IT ACTS AS A WEBSERVER AND CAN ALSO DO EVERYTHING A UBUNTU SERVER CAN DO LIKE RUN PYTHON SCRIPTS IT CURRENTLY RUNS A BOT I MADE PERFECTLY
I RECOMMEND PYTHONANYWHERE DEPLOYING IS PRETTY EASY AND THEY HAVE AN INTEGRATED IDE WHICH IS NICE
IF YOU WANT A HOST TO RUN WEBSITES OFF I STRONGLY RECOMMEND WEBFACTION THEY ALLOW YOU TO INSTALL WHATEVER YOU WANT ON THEIR SHARED SERVERS ANY PYTHON MODULE YOU CAN EVEN COMPILE RUN YOUR OWN HETP SERVER INSTANCE IF YOU WANT IT'S MO

IT'S GOT EASY INSTALLERS FOR DURANGO AND SUPPORTS MYSEL
HEROKU IS A GOOD PLACE FOR A SMALL DEV DATABASE I HAVE A SMALL DURANGO APP HOSTED ON PYTHONANYWHERE WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH A POSTURES DB ON HEROKU ALL FREE
GET SOME CHEAP APS AND MANAGE IT YOURSELF IT'S NOT DIFFICULT AND GIVEN THAT YOUR MAIN GOAL IS LEARNING IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN SOME SIMPLE SYSADMIN STUFF TOO A NICE LIST OF CHEAP APSES IS ON
YOU CAN DO ALL OF THAT ON THE ASW FREE TIER
R LEARNPYTHON IS A BETTER PLACE FOR SUCH QUESTIONS ALSO THAT QUESTION IS WEIRD AN IDE IS NOT AN INTERPRETER IT DOESN'T EXECUTE CODE
I SUPPOSE THERE WAS SOMETHING QUESTION AUTHOR HAD IN MIND BUT FOR ME IT MAKES NO SENSE

ARE NOT EXECUTING ANYTHING INTERPRETER DOES IT
2 IDE READ FILE AS A WHOLE OR IN CHUNKS NOT IN LINES

SO THE ANSWER COULD BE WHEN IT LOADS IT OR NEVER
OMITTING THE FACT THAT IDES DON'T EXECUTE CODE THE INTERPRETER DOES CODE MAY BE UNREACHABLE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU HAVE CODE INSIDE A FUNCTION BEHIND A RETURN STATEMENT

DEF FN
RETURN
DOESNTHAPPEN NEVER EXECUTED
THAT S THE SORT OF QUESTION I'D ASK WHEN TEACHING IF OF COURSE I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN IDE AND AN INTERPRETER SO I WOULD NOT PHRASE IT LIKE THAT
SORRY FOR BEING THE MECHANICAL ENGINEER HERE BUT USING THREE INTERLOCKING GEARS AS A LOGO WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MY CHOICE FOR LOGO DESIGN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY MAKE A FUNCTION A VARIABLE DEFINE A VARIABLE WITH THE SAME NAME AS FUNCTION IT JUST OVERRIDES THE FUNCTION ALSO NEXT TIME PLEASE POST QUESTIONS IN R LEARNPYTHON
THIS IS NOT THE SUBREDDIT FOR QUESTIONS YOU'VE ALREADY POSTED THIS IN R LEARNPYTHON SOMEONE SHOULD RESPOND THERE
I MUST SAY I'M ON ALL OF THE SUGGESTIONS RELATED TO THE FOR CONSTRUCTS THERE SHOULD BE ONLY ONE WAY TO DO THINGS

AS FOR THE GENERATOR YOU CAN ACTUALLY CREATE YOUR OWN GENERATOR TO HAVE THE API YOU WANT TO SOME ODD CASE IF YOU REALLY WANT IT TAKE A LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLES

IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE DEFAULT GENERATORS SHOULD BE MORE COMPLICATED OR EVEN WORSE NEED SPECIAL SYNTAX FOR THAT

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE THAT I'M ON THE IDEA PERSONALLY IF YOU REALLY THINK IT'S NICE GO ON AND HACK THE PYTHON CODE TO ADD IT NEVERTHELESS IT'S OPEN SOURCE AFTER ALL

STILL IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LAND IT IN PYTHON THE PROPER WAY TO ADD SOMETHING TO WOULD BE FIRST TO FIRST DISCUSS IT ON THE LIST AND IF OTHERS AGREE WRITE A PEP AND PROOF OF CONCEPT PSF ABOUT THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT
THERE ARE MAILING LISTS IN WHICH THEY DISCUSS THESE THINGS PYTHON IDEAS BUT NOTE THAT IS A WIDE DISTRIBUTION LIST WITH PRETTY MUCH ALL THE MAJOR NAMES YOU'D KNOW IN PYTHON I'D TEND TO AGREE WITH THE OTHER COMMENTS THINKING THERE MAY BE BETTER SYNTAX

INSTEAD YOU COULD LIKELY JUST MAKE YOUR USE CASE A LIBRARY OR COMPOSE SOME PIECES FROM ITERTOOLS IN THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF NUANCES IN YOUR PROPOSALS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IF YOUR TWO GENERATORS AREN'T THE SAME LENGTH WHAT IF A GENERATOR RAISES ETC
I HONESTLY LIKE FOR X IN GENERATOR AND Y IN GENERATOR 2 NOT REALLY SURE IF IT HELPS SINCE WE CAN DO FOR X Y IN ZIP ALREADY AND IT DOESNT MAKE MUCH SENSE TO ADD IT FOR JUST THE REASON THAT WE MIGHT LIKE THIS IT REALLY IS NOT ENOUGH REASON PLUS THIS IS CUTE FOR 2 GENERATORS BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU DO FOR X Y Z OR MORE WHICH ALSO HAPPENS YOUR METHOD WON'T SCALE
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH YOUR FIRST EXAMPLE THAT COULD NOT BE DONE WITH

FOR A IN
B A

AM I MISUNDERSTANDING SOMETHING

I VERY MUCH DOUBT THAT YOU'D GET MUCH AGREEMENT OVER YOUR OTHER SUGGESTIONS AS THEY LOOK TO ME LIKE FAR TOO MUCH WORK FOR FAR TOO LITTLE GAIN
EH NO THESE SUGGESTIONS ARE ILL-CONCEIVED

FOR INSTANCE FOR A AND B IN IS POOR NOTATION FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO DO SUCH SUGGESTIONS SHOULD BE LEFT TO PEOPLE WITH A SENSE OF STRUCTURE AND MATHEMATICS THEY'LL COME UP WITH A NOTATION THAT MAKES SENSE
YOUR SUGGESTIONS ARE UNJUSTIFIED AND I'M SURE COLD MAILING THE PSF IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO TRY CONTRIBUTING TO THE LANGUAGE
CURRENTLY WORKING ON A MEDIUM SIZED PROJECT WITH MONGODB MY ADVICE DON'T DO IT POSTURES IS A BETTER CHOICE IN EVERY WAY THAT MATTERS
WHY NOT USE SOLR IT WILL DO THE SHARDING ENGRAMS STOPWORDS ETC FOR YOU IT SCALES VERY WELL IN ITS CLOUD MODE
I ALREADY POSTED THIS LIKE A MONTH AGO MENTIONING THE BETTER PERFORMANCES OF PENDULUM COMPARED TO PUTZ

I UPDATED THE ARTICLE MENTIONING SOME CASES WHERE PUTZ DOES NOT BEHAVE PROPERLY WHEREAS PENDULUM DOES

THIS IS NOT AN ARTICLE THAT TELLS YOU TO DITCH COMPLETELY PUTZ BUT THAT YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER PENDULUM WHEN WORKING WITH TIMEZONES
I'VE BEEN USING PENDULUM ON MY LATEST PROJECT AND HAVE ENJOYED WORKING WITH IT I DID FIND A BUG THOUGH

IF YOU CREATE AN OBJECT USING THE OBJECT SEEMS OK BUT THEN IF YOU PICKLE IT IT WILL FAIL WHEN YOU DUNPICKLE THE OBJECT

SO IF YOU ARE WANTING TO DEFAULT TO THE TIME ZONE AS I AM IN THE PROGRAM USE TODAY T UTC
THIS LIBRARY HAS MADE MY LIFE SO MUCH EASIER I'VE STRIPPED DEATHTIME OUT OF ALMOST ALL OF MY PROJECTS IN FAVOR OF PENDULUM
THIS LOOKS GREAT I ALWAYS FORGET WHEN I NEED TO USE NORMALIZE AND LOCALIZE AND IN WHICH ORDER CONVERT IS EASIER
THIS IS NICE BUT OF MY OPERATIONS ARE IN PANDAS
THIS REALLY FITS BETTER IN R LEARNPYTHON

ALSO PLEEEEEEEEEEEASE DO TUTORIALS IN PYTHON NOT 2 MAKE THOSE TWO CHANGES AND I SUSPECT YOU'LL DO BETTER IN TERMS OF VOTES AT LEAST

TEXT IN IDLE IS ALSO TOO SMALL YOU SHOULD MAKE THE MORE LIKE SO IT'S EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO FOLLOW ALONG
GREAT WRITE-UP PERSONALLY I STARTED WITH PYTHON AND NEVER LOOKED BACK AND AS HE POINTS OUT IN HIS POST PYTHON IS CLEARLY THE FUTURE
WELCOME TO
IS SWITCHING THIS BIG OF A DEAL FOR MOST PEOPLE YOU'D THINK YOU WERE ASKING THEM TO SWITCH TO ASSEMBLY




THE FACT SOME PEOPLE CONTINUE TO WRITE CODE BAFFLES ME I UNDERSTAND EXISTING CODEBASES BEING STILL IN MIGRATION IS A HUGE PAIN IN THE BACK BUT I DON'T GET WHY SO MANY PLACES STILL TEACH IT'S GONNA BE DEAD LIKE NEXT YEAR ASSUMING GUIDO PULLS THE PLUG FOR REAL AND THERE'S PLENTY OF LIBRARIES FULLY ON
FOR WRITING PYTHON NOW IT'S MUCH MORE FUN AND THE ECOSYSTEM HAS REACHED A NICE POINT NOW

UNLESS YOU CAN'T MOVE AWAY FROM PYTHON 2 JUST DON'T USE IT ANYLONGER
IT SHOWS THEY ARE FEELING THREATENED BY PYTHON
A LOT OF THEIR POINTS ARE VALID BETTER COMPLETE LIBRARIES DOCUMENTATION SUPPORT ETC BUT THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND MATALAN BEING A TERRIBLE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND WAY TOO EXPENSIVE

THEIR FIRST EXAMPLE IS ALSO MISLEADING SINCE THE MATRIX BUMPY CLASS OR THE NEW OPERATOR MAKE BOTH PIECES OF CODE ON PAR IN TERMS OF READABILITY

LATHWORKS NEEDS TO JUST ADOPT THE PYTHON LANGUAGE AND OFFICIALLY SUPPORT IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF USING THEIR LIBRARIES
TL R


MATALAN IS BETTER THAN PYTHON GET IT NOW

LATHWORKS
LET'S RECOGNIZE THAT THIS WAS POSTED BY THE COMPANY THAT MAKES MATALAN AND IS REALLY AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR MATALAN RATHER THAN A LEGITIMATE COMPARISON ANYONE WHO HAS USED BOTH PYTHON AND MATALAN WILL UNDERSTAND HOW PAINFUL MATALAN IS FOR ANYTHING OF MORE THAN MINIMAL COMPLEXITY
OH THAT IS JUST HILARIOUS AND IT IS A SIGN THEY ARE FEELING VERY THREATENED BY PYTHON
HERE IS MORE REALISTIC COMPARISON

BLOG

AND ONE MORE

DOC USER
BIGGEST ADVANTAGES LATHWORKS HAS AT LEAST IN CONTROLS ENGINEERING IS SIMULINK AND AUTO CODE TO COUNTY I CAN PROTOTYPE A DESIGN OR TUNE SOME GAINS AND HAVE IT READY TO GO ON A MICROCONTROLLER IN A DAY OR SO
IT SHOULD BE EITHER DOWNVOTED INTO OBLIVION BECAUSE IT'S BLATANT SPAM OR POSTED IN R HUMOR
THIS COMPARISON WOULD HAVE REALLY BOTHERED ME A FEW YEARS AGO BUT IT ALMOST DOESN'T MATTER NOW SEE THIS QUOTE FROM

SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAPPENED IN THE SCIENTIFIC PYTHON WORLD DURING THE LAST YEAR WE ARE NO LONGER CONSTANTLY COMPARING OUR SOFTWARE WITH COMMERCIAL PACKAGES NOR JUSTIFYING THE NEED FOR PYTHON IN SCIENCE PYTHON HAS NOW REACHED THE LEVEL OF ADOPTION WHERE THIS SORT OF JUSTIFICATION IS NO LONGER NECESSARY THE EXACT MOMENT WHEN THIS SHIFT IN FOCUS OCCURRED IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY BUT THAT IT HAPPENED WAS APPARENT DURING THE CONFERENCE

GAEL VAROQUAUX STEFAN VAN DER WALT AND JARROD MILLMAN EDITORIAL PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH PYTHON IN SCIENCE CONFERENCE SNIPY NOTE LINK IS A PDF
THERE ARE SOME NASTY THINGS IN THE MATALAN LANGUAGE THAT PYTHON DOES MUCH MUCH MORE CLEANLY

MATALAN IS STILL WAY AHEAD IN TERMS OF PLOTTING CAPABILITIES ADVANCED SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES AND TO SOME EXTENT THE IDE IN MY OPINION ALTHOUGH I USUALLY USE VIM EVERYWHERE ELSE I DEAL WITH EDITOR BECAUSE THE CLINTING FEEDBACK IS VERY USEFUL

IN THE END I'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY STRUGGLING TO DO ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT IN PYTHON BECAUSE I'M STICK OF THE HORRIBLE MATALAN LANGUAGE AND THE COST BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY USE CASES WHERE I STILL TURN TO MATALAN DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE

YOUR CODE SEEMS TO BE WRITTEN UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS A TEXT FILE BUT THE ERROR YOU'RE GETTING INDICATES THAT IT ISN'T WHICH IS IT ARE THESE VALUES REPRESENTED AS RAW BINARY OR AS ASCII TEXT

AND SAYING THAT YOU HAVE A DATA FILE DOESN'T HELP THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING YOU NEED TO DESCRIBE THE ACTUAL FORMAT

WHAT'S A DATA FILE THAT'S THE MOST GENERIC SOUNDING FILE EVER BUT IT'S PROBABLY SUPER SPECIFIC

WHAT'S THE FILE LOOK LIKE
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON I AM ON MOBILE SO IT HARD FOR ME SEE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM HERE BUT I RIKK SUGGEST BREAKING THE LONG FUNCTION UP INTO A FEW SMALLER ONES IT WILL MAKE TROUBLESHOOTING MUCH MORE SIMPLE AND YOUR CODE MUCH EASIER TO MAINTAIN YOU MIGHT ALSO LOOK INTO USING A DICTIONARY TO CALL THE SEPARATE FUNCTIONS FOR THE DIFFERENT INPUTS
BTW

IF NEW-NAME IN CISTA

IF NEW-NAME NOT IN CISTA

IS A WASTE OF COMPUTATION SINCE PYTHON HAS TO ITERATE OVER CISTA TWICE

ANYWAY TO YOUR QUESTION YOU CAN'T DIRECTLY CHANGE THE KEY IN A DICTIONARY HOWEVER YOU CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE

CISTA JOE
CISTA BOB JOE

MAY I MAKE ANOTHER SUGGESTION DON T BACK YOURSELF INTO A CORNER WITH A DICTIONARY OF NAME AS THE KEY AND THE NUMBER AS THE VAL WHAT IF YOU DECIDE TO STORE ADDRESSES

MAKE THE VALUE A DICTIONARY OF THE INFORMATION YOU WILL LATER NEED DO SOMETHING LIKE

CISTA BOB PHONE

BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN LATER DO SOMETHING LIKE

WE HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT GENERATORS IN PYTHON THROUGH TWO EXAMPLES WHICH HAVE SHOWN HOW WE CAN USE THEM AND UTILIZE THE LAZINESS OF THEM TO DELAY CALCULATIONS TO THE TIME WHEN THEY ARE DEMANDED

ALTHOUGH THE ARTICLE IS INFORMATIVE I DON'T FEEL THIS WAS SHOWN WHAT I THINK WAS SHOWN IS HOW GENERATORS CAN BE USED TO DO DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING WITH GREAT READABILITY
VERY INTERESTING AND HELPFUL THANKS FOR SHARING

OF IT IS NETWORK IO PLS

DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE IT

YOU WANT VERSIONER PACKAGES NEW BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CONFIT FILE INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT EXECUTABLE CONFIT FILE WHICH MEANS YOU CAN CHOSE TO USE PIP OR NOT DEPENDING ON HOW YOUR DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM WORKS ETC

BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO IT



ARE YOU SURE YOU MEANT TO SUBMIT THIS TO R PYTHON BECAUSE IT HONESTLY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT OTHER THAN ADDING VERSIONING TO AN IMPORT SYSTEM WHICH DOESN'T SUPPORT VERSIONING WHICH SOUNDS MORE LIKE A PAIN IN THE ASS THAN ANYTHING AND IT WOULD ALSO CAUSE IT TO BE STRICTLY LOCKED TO PIPYARN INSTEAD OF BEING INDEPENDENT FROM THE PACKAGE MANAGER YAY

2 PICK SOME SCRAPING TOOL LIKE PYQUERY EASY IF YOU ALREADY KNOW QUERY SELECTORS OR BEAUTIFUL SOUP MORE MAINSTREAM AND TRY SCRAPING SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE A QUOTES WEBSITE INTO A JASON FILE OF JUST QUOTES AND THEN MAKE A SIMPLE STATIC HEML SITE WITH BOOTSTRAP WITH A FEW NAV BAR LINKS THAT ARE FOR QUOTES FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE THE SITE WON'T BE USEFUL ENOUGH TO BUY A HOST TO PUT IT UP SOMEWHERE BUT IT'LL GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW TO TALK ABOUT SOME BASIC CONCEPTS

IT ALSO HAS SUPPORT FOR SUB COMMANDS
IN YOUR FILE FOR INSTALLATION YOU CAN SPECIFY WHICH ALLOW YOU TO RUN A COMMAND MORE INFO

SALITE

OTHER THAN FIX YOUR CODE I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE WE COULD OFFER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM I WOULDN'T EXPECT JASON FILES TO GET CORRUPTED OFTEN IF YOU WRITE THEM CORRECTLY DO YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PROCESSES OR THREADS THAT COULD BE CHANGING THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY
YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS

IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN DATABASE WHICH IS WHAT YOU STARTED AND FOUND OUT HOW EASY IT IS TO DO WRONG

OR USE SOMEONE DATABASE

ID SUGGEST 2 SPECIFICALLY SALITE SINCE IT LIKELY FITS WHAT YOU'RE DOING IF YOU REALLY WANT TO STICK WITH JASON DATA STORES YOU COULD ALSO USE POSTURES WHICH LET'S YOU STORE JASON DIRECTLY IN A DB
IF ONLY PYTHON NEEDS TO READ IT WHY NOT JUST PICKLE THE DATA
IF YOU NEED A DATABASE USE A REAL DATABASE IF IT HAS TO EXIST LOCALLY WHY NOT USE SALITE
IF TOTAL SIZE IS LIMITED AND WRITES ARE NOT TOO FREQUENT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH USING A FILE

TO AVOID CORRUPTION MAKE SURE YOU SUCCESSFULLY WRITE THE ENTIRE FILE AND THE REPLACE IT ATOMICALLY HERE IS A CONTEXT MANAGER TO DO THIS FOR YOU

RECIPES


MAYBE TINYDB

I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS IN THE PAST
SOUNDS LIKE OPERATOR ERROR TO ME HONESTLY WANT TO POST SOME OF THE CODE
IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH A MONOLITHIC JASON OBJECT STORED IN A SINGLE FILE YOU COULD CONSIDER USING PANDAS AND ITS JASON I O THE JASON IO ARE SINGLE FUNCTIONS THAT TAKE THE FILENAME AND READ OR WRITE TO IT I EXPECT IT WILL BE BETTER TESTED AND MORE RESILIENT TO ERRORS PANDAS ALSO OFFERS A WAY FORWARD TOWARDS OTHER DATABASE BACKENDS AS IT IS ABLE TO INTERFACE WITH MANY DATABASES

PERSONALLY I JUST USE MONGODB FOR STASHING SCRAPED DATA THERE ARE SOME DOWNSIDES IF YOU NEED TO REPROCESS ALL THE DOCUMENTS IN PYTHON BUT IT IS GOOD IF YOU NEED RANDOM ACCESS TO SUBSETS AND FAST DOCUMENT CREATION
THE SCRAPY PACKAGE CAN HANDLE AUTHENTICATION
THE BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS IS TO LOOK AT THE HETP TRAFFIC THAT OCCURS WHEN YOU LOG IN IF THE LOGIN PAGE RENDERING REQUIRES JAVASCRIPT I BELIEVE YOU WILL NEED TO USE SELENIUM WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO AUTOMATE THE BROWSER ACTIVITY NEEDED TO MAKE IT WORK IF NOT I WOULD SUGGEST USING THE PYTHON REQUESTS MODULE USING SESSIONS AND IT'S AUTHENTICATION FEATURES TO HANDLE IT DO YOU HAVE A LINK TO THE LOGIN PAGE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL
TRY USING THE REQUESTS MODULE AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED THE FOLLOWING CODE EXAMPLE SHOULD GET YOU ON THE RIGHT TRACK THIS METHOD WORKED FOR ME AT WORK WHEN I NEEDED TO ACCESS SOME DATA BEHIND A LOGIN YOU NEED TO VIEW THE SOURCE CODE OF THE PAGE CONTAINING THE LOGIN FORM AND CHECK WHAT THE FIELD NAMES ARE CALLED AND IF THERE ARE ANY HIDDEN FIELDS AS WELL SUCH AS OP IN THIS CASE YOU ALSO NEED TO GRAB THE FORM ACTION'S NRL TO USE IN THE CALL

YOU CAN TO A DIFFERENT NRL HERE IF NEEDED
PATH TEXT

YOU JUST NEED TO WORK OUT THE NAMES FOR THE USER PASS INPUTS AND THE PATHS FOR THE ELEMENTS YOU WANT TO EXTRACT THE DATA FROM

I LIKE PATHS AND I FIND THIS API STYLE TO BE PRETTY CONGRUENT WITH THE MENTAL MODEL OF HOW I THINK ABOUT EXTRACTING DATA FROM A WEBPAGE
NORMALLY THIS WILL ALL HAPPEN IN JUST
CLEANEST WAY WOULD BE TO USE SELENIUM
KINDA A LOADED QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO INSTALL IT ON WHAT ARE YOUR SYSTEM SPECS WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON ESPECIALLY IF YOU SAY WHAT OS YOU'RE ON
NONE INSTALL HOMEBREW AND HAVE THAT INSTALL PYTHON FOR YOU
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH PONY WHAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF USING PONY OVER SQLALCHEMY
THIS IS GREAT BUT BLAZE IS BETTER IMO
THIS IS GOOD NEWS THE PREVIOUS LICENSE WAS LITTLE RESTRICTIVE FOR ME
IF YOU HAVE TO WRITE UNIT TESTS FOR YOUR SPREADSHEET YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE USING A SPREADSHEET TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU SHOULD BE USING A DATABASE AND PYTHON OR ROYAL

WEB



I UNDERSTAND THE ARTICLE USED THE EXAMPLE OF INHERITING LEGACY CODE BUT I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO BE CLEAR THAT EXCEL IS NOT AN IDEAL TOOL FOR THIS KIND OF SITUATION IF ONE DOES HAVE A CHOICE IF IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE VERSION CONTROLLED
HAHA I THINK THIS IS GREAT
I'D PREFER REWRITING STUFF USING BLOWINGS BUT HEY WHY NOT WRITE THE TESTS TO WORK WITH EXCEL FIRST AND MIGRATE AFTERWARDS COOL
YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING WITH SBA IT IS ALL ABOUT HAVING GOOD PROGRAMMING STANDARDS
NEAT

I'VE DONE SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH PYTHON AND ASPACE
USE A METASEARCH ENGINE LIKE SEAR THAT PROVIDES A WAY TO GET JASON RESULTS
YOU MIGHT GET MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON

YOU'RE QUESTION IS A LITTLE CONFUSING IT'S BOTH TOO VAGUE AND TOO SPECIFIC AT THE SAME TIME

YOU WANT TO SCRAPE THE FIRST PAGE OF GOOGLE RESULTS AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU DON'T WANT A HEADLESS BROWSER API OR SERVICE BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE AND YOU NEED SOMEONE TO TELL YOU HOW

USING CURL
CURL

USING PYTHON AND REQUESTS
IMPORT REQUESTS
RESPONSE

NOW IF PLANNING ON DOING SOME PARSING AND MANIPULATION WITH THE RESULTS I'D LOOK INTO ONE OF THE NUMEROUS SCRAPING LIBRARIES SCRAPY BEAUTIFULSOUP ETC AVAILABLE THEY'VE BEEN CREATED FOR THIS EXACT USE CASE
DOES THIS MODULE WORK ON WINDOWS OR SOLELY LINUX DSX
I'VE NEVER USED FANCY BUT I'VE USED TOOL QUITE A BIT I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ITERABLE IT'S FAST CTOOLZ DROPS IN AND EACH PIECE IS ATOMIC IT ALSO FEELS LIKE NATIVE PYTHON IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE I'M BORROWING HASKELL SYNTAX WHICH I APPRECIATE
YOU MIGHT GET MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON
WHAT IS REMI IT'S REALLY STUPID WHEN PEOPLE POST NEWS ABOUT PROJECTS AND EXPECT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT THE PROJECT IS ABOUT
YES

I COULD DEFINITELY USE SOME HELP OVER AT

IT'S A NETWORKING LIBRARY DESIGNED TO WORK WITH MULTIPLE LANGUAGES A LOT OF WHAT I NEED HELP WITH IS IMPROVING EFFICIENCY AND READABILITY IN EXISTING CODE I'D BE ABLE TO HELP WALK YOU THROUGH ANYTHING YOU NEEDED HELP WITH

IT WOULD ALSO BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO COME UP WITH SOME BETTER DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION
YES

SEAR IS A META SEARCH ENGINE WITH MANY FEATURES AND SOURCES THERE ARE ISSUES ENHANCEMENTS AND FEATURE REQUESTS THE CODE IS RATHER EASY TO GET WITH
MYSEARCH IS A PROXY FOR GOOGLE SEARCHES LARGE ROOM FOR NEW FEATURES
ABELUJO IS A FREE SOFTWARE FOR BOOKSHOPS THE FIRST OF THE KIND MANY STUFF STILL TO DO INVOLVING BACKEND FRONTED AND A LIBRARY WITH WEBSCRAPING AND THAT'S MY BABY
GATHER MULTIPLE FREE SOCIAL NETWORKS FEDERATION API IN ONE PACKAGE
MEDIAGLOBIN DISTRIBUTED YOUTUBE
BUILDING TOOLS FOR SERMONET AN EASY INSTALLER A DESKTOP ICON THE LIKE
I'M DEFINITELY UP FOR SOME HELP WITH BITON AT IT'S A DIALOG BASED AMMO GAME I'VE GOTTEN A FEW CORE COMPONENTS DOWN BUT I NEED A WAY OF KEEPING TRACK OF BATTLES HANDLING RANDOM ENCOUNTERS ETC I'D GLADLY RECIPROCATE ANY HELP BY HELPING WITH ANY PROJECTS YOU MIGHT HAVE
WAIT SO THE GOAL WAS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT DOCKER IS NOT JUST CROUPS AND CHEROOT BUT THIS SCRIPT DOES ONLY THAT

AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THE REST OF IT IS JUST FOR PULLING PREGUILT IMAGES AND BASIC SETUP
CHANGE SHIRT SLOGAN TO ACCEPT NOTIMPLEMENTEDERROR AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A STEW GOIN
I WAS AT THE NEETUP TONIGHT GREAT PROJECT
THANK YOU
THANKS THE TOPICS COVERED IN THE BOOK ARE REALLY A GOOD SELECTION OF ADVANCED TOPICS AS A BACKER I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO READING YOUR NEW LATEST BOOK
THANK YOU REALLY SO MANY BOOKS ABOUT BASIC STUFF AND SO FEW JUST THE NEXT LEVEL
THANK YOU THANK YOU
BOUGHT THIS ALONG WITH ABOUT A MONTH AGO ON AMAZON AND HAVE REALLY ENJOYED BOTH THANKS FOR OFFERING THIS TO OTHERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD IT IN THE PAST
THANK YOU CAN I HAVE YOUR EMAIL SO I CAN SEND A SMALL PALPAL DONATION

THANKS MAN
THANKS
THIS SHOULD BE FUN THANK YOU SIR
THANK YOU AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE COVER ARTICLE
JUST DOWNLOADED THE BOOK THANKS A LOT
THANK YOU FOR THIS I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO GETTING BACK INTO LEARNING PROGRAMMING AFTER A LONG HIATUS THIS WILL DEFINITELY HELP
THANKS A LOT FOR THIS CONTAINS QUITE A FEW TOPICS I'VE BEEN MEANING TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH

WILL CERTAINLY BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR UPCOMING MATERIAL
THANK YOU FOR THIS

TO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHICH PROVIDER TO CHOOSE USING LEANPUB MEANT I JUST HAD TO PUT IN AN EMAIL ADDRESS AND IT DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR PAYMENT INFORMATION I COULDN'T GET GUMROAD NOT TO ASK FOR PAYMENT INFO
DELETED
THIS LOOKS LIKE A GREAT COMBINATION OF STUFF I ALREADY KNOW OR PARTLY KNOW AND NEW THINGS AND I LOVE THE COVER THANK YOU FOR THE FREE BOOK
THANKS SO MUCH THIS BOOK LOOKS GREAT I KNOW PYTHON PRETTY WELL BUT I NEVER USED ANY KIND OF TUTORIAL HORRIBLE IDEA FYI SO THERE ARE A FEW ODD GAPS IN MY KNOWLEDGE I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU PUT A SECTION ON THE TYPING MODULE SINCE THAT'LL PROBABLY BE PRETTY IMPORTANT IN THE NEXT YEARS OF PYTHON

ALSO YOU HAD UPVOTES BEFORE I HIT IT
IN REENTRANT CONTEXT MANAGERS SECTION

LET S USE THE CONTEXT MANAGER THAT WE USED BEFORE

THE CODE SAMPLE HERE LOOKS LIKE IT IS NOT FORMATTED CORRECTLY PDF FROM LEANPUB

EDIT HERE'S HOW IT LOOKED FOR ME
THANKS I AM NOT NEW TO PROGRAMMING BUT I JUST STARTED DIVE INTO PYTHON THIS WEEK WOULD YOU RECOMMEND I START WITH OR DO YOU THINK AFTER DIVE THAT WOULD BE FINE
WOO THANKS A LOT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A BOOK LIKE THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE I WILL DEFINITELY READ IT BEST OF LUCKS
TOP STUFF THANKS FOR THIS
THANK YOU I WILL DEFINITELY TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR BOOK I HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH SOME OF THESE SUBJECTS LATELY JUST TODAY I USED THE IMPORTLIB MODULE FOR THE 1ST TIME AS I TRY TO DO MORE SOPHISTICATED STUFF

THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH FOR RELEASING THIS FOR FREE WHILE I LOVE PYTHON I HAVE TO USE AND SOME RUBY FOR WORK CAME BACK TO PYTHON RECENTLY AS I MISSED IT I'VE BEEN ON A BIT OF A HUNT FOR MORE ADVANCED READING AND YOUR BOOK LOOKS PERFECT THERE ARE SOOSOO MANY RESOURCES OUT THERE FOR BASIC LOWER INTERMEDIATE PROGRAMMERS BUT THE LIST OF RESOURCES FOR ADVANCED TOPICS IS CONSIDERABLY SHORTER


THAT GUMROAD WEBSITE IS BIZARRE THERE S NO DESKTOP VERSION AND IT S MEANT AS A BUY AND SELL HUB BUT ABSOLUTELY ALL VERBIAGE ASSUMES YOU RE THERE TO SELL
CONGRATS ON FINISHING THE BOOK THANK YOU FOR SHARING WILL POINT SOME OTHER FOLKS TO IT AS WELL

THANK YOU THIS WILL BE A GOOD AVENUE FOR ME TO START USING PYTHON AGAIN
WOULD LOVE TO READ THIS

BUT IT TOOK MINUTES TO GET A TOKEN FROM LEANPUB TRIED IT HOURS LATER AND IT DIDN'T WORK WON'T SEND ME ONE NOW AND GUMROAD JUST DOESN'T RESPOND

NO IDEA WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE BUT TOO ANNOYING TO KEEP BOTHERING
WOULD BE GREAT TO GET THE ASAEL
THANKS

THANKS
THANK YOU I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT ITERTOOLS FOR A WHILE NOW
THANK YOU SIR
THANK YOU KIND SIR
GREAT BEAUTIFUL COVER
THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR
SO GLAD I STUMBLED ACROSS THIS WHEN I DID THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING THIS AWAY

SHOOTOUT TO U ON R LEARNPROGRAMMING AS WELL FOR LINKING EVERYONE HERE
YOU'RE THE BEST YOU AND U ALSWEIGART BOTH HELPED ME WHEN I STARTED LEARNING WITH YOU GUYS BOOKS THANK YOU
SO I DOWNLOADED IT BECAUSE FREE AND STARTED TO LOOK I DECIDED I WOULD SEE IF I CAN FIGURE OUT YOUR ARGPARSE SECTION AND I AM ALREADY SEEING WHERE I MAY BECOME FRUSTRATED BY THIS BOOK IT ISN'T ABOUT CONTENT IT IS PRESENTATION

TWO COMMENTS

IT IS VERY CONFUSING THAT ALL CODE SECTIONS HAVE NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE IT MAKES SENSE IN A CODE LISTING EAST G PAGE AND BUT THEN YOU USE THE SAME THING FOR EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS MIDDLE PAGE LATER ON PAGE YOUR GOOD ABOUT USING WHICH HELPS A LITTLE BUT FOR INTERACTING IN THE SHELL PAGE IS UNCLEAR

2 YOUR COLORING IS MESSED UP LOOK AT THE COLORS IN THE BOTTOM VERBATIM BLOCK OF PAGE

NAMESPACE X SOMETHING Y FALSE Z

THE COLORING DOESN'T END AT THE END OF SOMETHING BEFORE Y FALSE ALSO WHAT IS NAMESPACE I AM GUESSING THAT IS HOW ARGPARSE SHOWS A PRINT CALL BUT THIS IS ALSO UNCLEAR

ADDENDUM I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT I DO NOT MEAN TO CRAP ALL OVER YOUR BOOK SKIMMING THROUGH THE REST OF IT I THINK I MAY FIND SOME OF IT USEFUL I JUST STARTED LOOKING AT THE DB STUFF AND THAT LOOKS GOOD TOO THOUGH AT THE END IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU SUGGEST PEOPLE USE SQLALCHEMY BUT DON'T TEACH IT ANYWAY THANKS FOR THE BOOK I WILL SEE IF I FIND IT USEFUL
THANK YOU
THANK YOU
LOVE YOU

AWESOME THANKS SO MUCH LOOKS LIKE GREAT CONTENT
THANKS A LOT FOR THIS
THANK YOU SHOULD I START WITH YOUR BOOK IF I'M JUST GETTING STARTED AND OR USE OTHER RESOURCES ALONG WITH THE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS
THANKS A LOT

THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST DOWNLOADED IT
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU BRO
APPRECIATED AS SOMEONE WHO'S FELT A LITTLE FAILED BY LUA
I HOPE YOUR BOOK CAN PUT ME ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW OF ADVANCING MY PYTHON
THANK YOU SO MUCH I AM LEARNING PYTHON RIGHT NOW HAVING ANOTHER RESOURCE WILL BE GREAT
FIRST OF ALL THANKS FOR WRITING AND SHARING YOUR BOOK I WAS GLAD TO SEE THE SECTION ON ASYNC AWAIT SO I JUMPED STRAIGHT TO THAT HOWEVER THERE SEEM TO BE SOME MISTAKES IN THE EXAMPLES USING BLOCKING I O EG IN A COROUTINE DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING AN EVENT LOOP AND PREVENTS OTHER ASYNCHRONOUS FUNCTIONS FROM RUNNING CONCURRENTLY INSTEAD VERSIONS OF THESE FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE USED EG ALONG WITH THE AWAIT SYNTAX TO ALLOW CONTROL TO PASS BACK TO THE EVENT LOOP WHILE THE I O IS PENDING
THANKS I FOUND A TYPO

AT THE START OF CHAPTER


THANKS
THANK YOU MAN
THANK YOU
THANK YOU THANK YOU I AM BUYING YOU MY FIRST EVER REDDIN GOLD
THANK YOU SO MUCH I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING THIS NEXT FEW WEEKS
THANK YOU
THANK YOU CHECKING OUT YOUR BLOG AS WELL
DUDE THANK YOU SO MUCH FROM ME AND MY FRIENDS SORRY FOR SALE LOSS THIS SURE WILL COME IN HANDY

CAN WE KNOW WHAT DROVE YOU TO GIVE IT AWAY FOR FREE FOR THESE DAYS
OH WHY DO I ALWAYS MISS STUFF LIKE THIS
HOW COULD I HAD MISSED THIS
PAGE THERE IS SMALL MISTAKE YOU SEARCH REGEL IN TEXT VARIABLE INSTEAD OF
FREE FOR
AND SINCE SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO REPRESENT NULL DATES IN DATABASES AS EVERYTHING EXPLODED
THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR DID NOT EXIST BACK THEN EVEN EXTENDING IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO YEAR IS REALLY STRETCHING IT THIS IS KNOWN AS THE PROLEPTIC GREGORIAN CALENDAR

ANYONE WHO HANDLES REALLY ANCIENT DATES ASTRONOMY HISTORY USES SPECIALTY LIBRARIES

I'M NOT A PRO DEVELOPER SO PULL REQUESTS IMPROVING THE CODE GENERAL FEEBACK ARE WELCOME
DOESN'T NUM OR ALWAYS EVALUATE TO TRUE OR AND IS THEREFORE ALWAYS TRUE
FROM MATH IMPORT SQRT FLOOR

NUM INT INPUT ENTER ANY NUMBER

IF NUM

PRINT IS NOT A PRIME NUMBER FORMAT NUM

R LEARNPYTHON
BASICS THIS SHOULD EXPLAIN COMPREHENSIONS QUITE WELL
GREAT CASE FOR DURANGO CHECK THE DURANGO EXTENSIONS SITE FOR COMMERCE
I GENERALLY PREFER FLASK BUT IN THAT CASE DURANGO MAY BE A BETTER FIT YOU CHOOSE FLASK FOR ITS FLEXIBILITY AND PERFORMANCE THESE THINGS ARE GENERALLY NOT AN ISSUE FOR AN WEBSITE I WOULD PICK FLASK FOR MORE COMPLEX UNIQUE APPLICATIONS
I RECENTLY MADE A SCRIPT THAT TAKES ALL MY LECTURE NOTES AND COMPILES THEM INTO A MASTER FILE THEN UPLOADS IT TO GOOGLEDRIVE SO I CAN STUDY ANYTIME ON ANY OF MY DEVICES HAD SOME FUN COMPILING MY NOTES FROM SOME OLDER CLASSES JUST TO WATCH THIS BABY IN ACTION
SOMEONE A WHILE BACK DID ONE OF THESE THREADS AND UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T FIND THE LINK BUT THEY SAID THAT THEY CREATED A SCRIPT TO CHECK THEIR LOCAL CINEMA LISTINGS AND THEN EMAIL THEMSELVES WHENEVER THEIR CINEMA WAS SHOWING A FILM WITH A DECENT IADB RATING THAT THEY SET THE BAR FOR

IT GARNERED A LOT OF INTEREST AND COMMENTS SO I WROTE A TUTORIAL ON HOW YOU WOULD USE PYTHON AND SCRAPY TO AUTOMATICALLY CHECK YOUR CINEMA LISTINGS AND GET NOTIFIED ABOUT THOSE WITH A HIGH IADB RATING MIGHT HELP SOME
I RECENTLY FINISHED A TOTAL REWRITE OF A SCRIPT THAT I RUN ONCE A YEAR TO COMPILE STATISTICS ON USAGE AT OUR LOCAL LIBRARIES IT READS DOZENS OF CSF FILES AS INPUT FROM AN AUTOMATED REPORT THAT RUNS MONTHLY AND EMAILS THE REPORT TO ME AND PARSES THEM USING PANDAS CRUNCHES THE DATA AND THEN CREATES A PIVOT TABLE WITH THE RESULTS THAT I WANT AND SAVES THAT AS AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET THIS YEAR IT WAS CSF FILES WITH CLOSE TO LINES TOTAL PARSED DOWN TO ROWS AND COLUMNS IN THE PIVOT TABLE RUN TIME LESS THAN TEN MINUTES GOOD UNTIL NEXT YEAR
RETURNING HETP RESPONSES TO PEOPLE WHO MAKE HETP REQUESTS

IT TOTALLY BEATS RUNNING NETCHA ON PORT AND MANUALLY TYPING OUT RESPONSES
AT HOME I HAVE A WHITE NOISE GENERATOR FOR MY SON IN HIS ROOM BASICALLY A SPEAKER AND A RASPBERRY PI WHICH IS CONTROLLED BY A BUTTON ON A WEBPAGE IT'S EXTREMELY SIMPLE AT THE MOMENT BUT I PLAN TO MAKE IT MORE ADDING OTHER TYPES OF WHITE NOISE LULLABIES MAYBE CONTROL A NIGHT LIGHT

IN WORK WELL I USE IT FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE BUILD AND TEST SYSTEMS FOR OUR MAIN CODE IN C WRITTEN IN PYTHON WE HAVE NO REAL NEED FOR A CI PLATFORM YET SO A SIMPLE SYSTEM IN PYTHON IS PERFECT WE ALSO USE IT TO AUTOMATE ALL OF OUR HARDWARE TESTING CONTROLLING INSTRUMENTS GENERATING REPORTS ETC LIKE LITERALLY WE USE IT FOR EVERYTHING
A SCRIPT THAT WATCHES A RADIO STATION I LIKE AND COLLECTS ALL THE SONGS IT PLAYS HOW MANY TIMES AND THE NEW SONGS ADDED SO I CAN FIND NEW SONGS NEXT STEP IS TO ADD AUTO DOWNLOAD WITH BISYNC TO AUTO ADD TO MY PHONE AND COMPUTER

ONE THAT SENDS ME A TEXT WHEN THERE IS A REDDIN POST THAT REACHES UPVOTES IN UNDER HOURS WORKING ON MIGRATION FROM 2 TO AND PEP ONE OF FIRST SCRIPTS FROM 2 YEARS AGO

ONE THAT LOGS INTO A MICRO INVESTING SITE AND CHECKS THE AP OF OFFERS AND IF ONES GOOD ENOUGH RIGHT WHEN IT COMES LIVE IT BUYS IT

ONE THAT GOES THROUGH A HUGE LIST OF STOCKS EVERY HOUR AND CHECKS FOR UNDERVALUED HIGH DIVIDEND STOCKS AND PUTS IT ON MY WEBSITE

FUTURE MAKING A SCRIPT THAT LOGS INTO AND BUYS IT IF IT'S THE MYSTERY BOX BUT HAVING TROUBLE SELECTING THE OVERLAY TO PUT IN INFORMATION
I WROTE MYSELF A SCRIPT THAT GETS MENU INFO FROM ALL PIZZERIAS IN SELECTED AREA PUTS THEM IN THE DATABASE AND LETS YOU SEARCH THROUGH THEM TO GET BEST DEALS LIKE LEAST COST PER CM 2 INCLUDING DELIVERY
OBVIOUSLY THE BORING STUFF
I AUTOMATE RESTARTING MY FLASK SERVER WITH PYTHON I DON'T LIKE TO RUN FLASK IN DEBUG MODE BUT I ALSO LIKE BEING ABLE TO SAVE A CHANGE AND HAVE IT IMMEDIATELY RESTART THE SERVER TO REFLECT THE NEW CHANGES SO I WHIPPED UP A PYTHON TEXT EDITOR USING A TUTORIAL I FOUND A WHILE BACK I EDIT THE FILE WITH IT AND SAVE IT IT RUNS IT THROUGH SOME TESTS TO MAKE SURE IT WON'T GET ANY TRACEBACK ERRORS IF ALL LOOKS GOOD IT STOPS AND RESTARTS THE FLASK SCRIPT USING SUBPROCESS CALLS IF ANYTHING IS WRONG IT SENDS ME BACK TO THE EDITOR AFTER DISPLAYING THE TRACEBACK AND MY STILL WORKING PREVIOUS VERSION REMAINS RUNNING
THE BORING STUFF
A SCRIPT THAT CHECKS MY LOCAL ONLINE MARKETPLACE FOR PRICE DROPS EVERY MIN OR SO AND SENDS ME AN EMAIL WHEN THE PRICE IS UNDER THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT I WANT TO PAY


BASICALLY A CAMELCAMELCAMEL LIKE ALERT FOR MY LOCAL EBAY
AUTOMATICALLY MAKING INVOICES FROM THE PURCHASE ORDERS MY WIFE GETS EMAILED TO HERALDRY IT SCRAPES HER EMAIL AND EXTRACTS THE NUMBERS PUTS THEM IN A FORMATTED EXCEL SHEET SHE THEN COPIES THAT TO WORD JUST TO MAKE IT PRETTY AND ATTACHES I COULD GO THAT STEP TOO POSSIBLY BUT IT WASN'T WORTH IT

I ASSUME MOST OF THE OTHER EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN PUTTING THIS LABORIOUS CRAP IN BY HAND FOR YEARS IT TAKES LIKE MIN OF COPY PASTING FOR EVERY TIME YOU HAVE TO INVOICE EVEN JUST WORTH OF INVOICED WEEK MY WAY PRODUCES THE EXCEL SHEET WITH ONE CLICK IN SECONDS
DOWNLOADING AND RESIZING IMAGES FOR SOME OF THE BLOG WORK I DO HERE ARE A COUPLE OF MY SCRIPTS AS GISTS
WEB SCRAPING ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 3RD PARTY APIS FOR THIS SITES NORMALLY CHANGE THEIR CODE A LOT TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM PULLING THIS DIRECTLY MY WORKAROUND INVOLVED USING WEBBROWSER MODULE TO FOOL THEM INTO THINKING I'M DOING THIS MANUALLY
HAH I ACTUALLY JUST WHIPPED UP A QUICK COMMAND LINE TOOL TO EASILY GET SANS OFF SS CARTS

OR JUST CUT TO THE CHASE AND INSTALL IT WITH PIP INSTALL SANAI
AT WORK I MADE A SCRIPT TO FILTER AND TRANSFORM A DATAFILE FOR BULK IMPORT INTO A DATABASE IT TOOK LINES OF PYTHON TO REPLACE LINES OF C THAT DIDN'T QUITE DO WHAT WAS NEEDED

AT HOME I MADE A SCRIPT TO MONITOR MY DOCUMENTS FOLDER FOR CLICKERHEROES SAVE FILES AND ARCHIVE THEM TO TAKE THE MANUAL TEDIUM OUT OF THAT
WEB SCRAPING BOTS ASW SCRIPTS FOR WORK
MIGRATING DATA FROM ONE DB TO ANOTHER
NETWORK DEVICE CONFIGURATION BACKUPS I USE IT TO CONNECT TO VARIOUS APIS OR ALIS TO BACKUP ARCHIVE THE CONFIGURATIONS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT

ADDITIONALLY I'M STARTING TO USE IT TO AUTOMATE ACCESS LATER NETWORKING CHANGES THAT WAY ANY CONFIGURATIONS COME FROM A STANDARDIZED PRECONFIGURED AND LIST

A REALLY BASIC SCRIPT THAT GETS THE EMBEDDED VIDEO FROM PUTLOCKER SO I CAN OR MPV IT FIRST PYTHON SCRIPT AND IT GETS USED DAILY
NOTHING MUCH JUST MY JOB AND MY HOUSE
WEBSCRAPING AND NOTIFYING ME BY UNDER CERTAIN CRITERIA FOR MULTIPLE WEBSITES
BATCH PROCESSING API CALLS AGGREGATING THE RESULTING CSF OUTPUT FILES WRITING ADDITIONAL CALCULATED FIELDS AND CLEANING UP THE STRUCTURE INTO FLAT LISTS FOR TABLEAU VISUALISATION




MY TEST TEAM AT WORK USES PYTHON IN OUR SYSTEM INTEGRATION TESTS TO CONTROL THE LAUNCHING OF THE MULTIPLE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS IN OUR SYSTEM FEEDING TEST DATA INTO THE SYSTEM AND THEN OBSERVING AND PARSING THE RESULTS
I HAVE JOBS THAT USE WINDOWS TASK SCHEDULER TO RUN QUERIES AGAINST A DATA WAREHOUSE PROCESSES THE RESULTS MOSTLY WITH PANDAS AND WRITES THE FILES TO EXCEL OR TO CSF FILES

I AUTOMATE INVENTORY ENTRY FOR COMMERCE WITH IT
MY COMPANY'S NETWORK
WE ARE UPGRADING TO A NEW VERSION OF OUR BUSINESS SYSTEM AND I HAVE TO MAKE SURE OUR DATA IS COPIED EXACTLY TO THE NEW VERSION I USE PYTHON TO LIST THE SETTINGS COMPARE THE TWO SYSTEMS FOR DIFFERENCES AND THEN AUTOMATICALLY CLICK THROUGH THE MENUS TO UPDATE THE DATA
ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WAS USING ASW A LOT FOR A PROJECT SINCE I WAS ON MY WIFI AND WAS REASSIGNED A NEW IP EVERY DAY OR SO I NEEDED A WAY TO MANAGE A WHITE LIST OF VALID IP ADDRESSES SO I USED THE BITO API WITH MY AMAZON CREDENTIALS TO CHECK IF MY CURRENT IP WAS ON THE WHITE LIST AND IF NOT TO ADD IT IT WOULD THEN WAIT A COUPLE OF SECONDS FOR THIS TO REGISTER AND THEN TSH ME INTO MY INSTANCE
EVERY MORNING I GATHER DATA CREATES SIX GRAPHS EMBED THEM IN AN OUTLOOK EMAIL WHICH IS SENT TO THE EXECUTIVES WHILE I GET A CUP OF COFFEE


IT'S REALLY GREAT TO AUTOMATE THE COFFEE MAKING
PEOPLE ON HERE BE DOING STUFF THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS

MEANWHILE I MADE A SCRIPT THAT READS FROM A CSF FILE FILLED WITH SHOW NAMES AND DAYS THEY AIR AND PULLS UP THE CORRECT STREAMING PAGE FOR THEM BASED ON THE TYPE OF SHOW THEY ARE

I DID THIS BECAUSE I'M ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD AND KEEPING TRACK OF WHAT'S AIRING ON WHAT DAY IN THE US IS A PAIN IN THE BUTT SAVES ME A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME EVERYDAY BECAUSE IT OPENS THE CORRECT PAGE IN BATCHES RATHER THAN HAVING TO MANUALLY SEARCH EACH SHOW ACROSS A COUPLE DIFFERENT SITES

AND I USE PYTHON FOR AUTOMATING MY LESSON PLAN SORTING I CAN JUST PRODUCE LESSONS AND MATERIALS AND IT AUTOMATICALLY SORTS IT INTO THE RIGHT SUBDIRECTORIES SO I CAN QUICKLY FIND GAMES OR WORKSHEETS OR ANY TAG QUITE SIMPLY BASED ON CLASS LEVEL
RELATED TO TESTING

LOG BACKUPS
LOG SCRAPING FOR FAILURE ROLLMOPS
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT LOGGING
CLI MENU TESTING
AUTOMATION REGRESSION TESTING
I HAVE A CLIPT THAT LAUNCHES UPON COMPLETION OF A TASK THAT LAUNCHES A 3RD PARTY RENAMING APPARENTLY FROM THIS IT CREATES A FOLDER STRUCTURE BASED ON THE FILENAME AND COPIES TO A NAS

AT WORK I CREATED A SIMPLE SCRIPT THAT JOINED MULTIPLE CSF FILES TOGETHER
MY MORNING WEB NOVEL AND MANGA SCRAPING
I WAS DESIGNING THE ID CARDS FOR AN EVENT THERE WERE CARDS IN TOTAL BEFORE PRINTING WE HAD TO PLACE CARDS ON AN A4 SHEET IN PHOTOSHOP SO THAT CARDS CAN BE PRINTED AT A TIME I WROTE A SCRIPT WHICH TOOK INDIVIDUAL CARD SCALED IT AND PLACED IT ON THE A4 SHEET IN ORDER NEEDLESS TO SAY I GOT A LOT OF APPLAUSE FROM MY MATES WHO DIDN'T KNOW PROGRAMMING AND WERE WONDERING WHAT VOODOO I HAD JUST DONE
I USE IT TO CLEANSE PRODUCTION DATA AFTER I'VE IMPORTED IT INTO A DEV DB SCRUBBING PEOPLE'S NAMES BLANKING BIRTHDATES ETC
I AUGMENT OUR REGRESSION MANUAL TESTING WITH AUTOMATED SCRIPTS USING SKILFUL AND PYTHON I KNOW ITS NOT PYTHON BUT ITS CLOSE ANYWHERE IN OUR PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT HAVE KEYSTROKE SHORTCUTS OR TAB ORDER AND REQUIRES MOUSE CLICKS AND USER INTERACTION I USE HIKULI TO PERFORM THOSE TASKS AS WELL AS ASSERT RESULTS OR PERFORM NEGATIVE TESTING IN DATA FIELDS

ANYWHERE THAT DOES HAVE KEYSTROKES OR KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS I STILL USE BUILT IN PYTHON COMMANDS WHICH AUTOMATES FASTER AND MORE CONSISTENT THAN I CAN LOL
DEPLOYING LINUX ON BARE METAL HARDWARE HETP

OF COURSE I DIDN'T WRITE IT ALL MYSELF I JUST WORK FOR THE COMPANY THAT DOES
TOGGLE A SCRIPT THAT WILL TAKE A FILENAME AND APPEND REMOVE AN UNDERSCORE VERY NICE WHEN YOU WANT TO BRIEFLY DISABLE A SETTINGS FILE PUGIN SCRIPT OR SOMESUCH THE SCRIPT CHECKS FOR BOTH VERSIONS OF THE FILE SO YOU CAN USE TOGGLE HG HERC TO DISABLE YOUR HERC AND THEN REUSE THE SAME COMMAND TO RENABLE IT

PLEASE DISREGARD THE USE OF RESULT OBJECTS AS WELL AS THE TOGGLEFILE CLASS WHICH LOOKS STATEFUL BUT DOESN'T UPDATE ITSELF I THOUGHT I'D PLAY WITH OO STYLE IN THIS SCRIPT FUNCTIONAL IS MY USUAL THING SO THERE'S A FEW DESIGN DECISIONS THAT ARE MORE EXPERIMENT THAN BEST PRACTICE
WEB SCRAPING AND AUTORUN THINGS WITH SPECIFIC RULES BUT MOSTLY IM USING IT TO AUTOMATE STUFF AT MY WORK BUILDING REVIEWS ETC
PLEASE CHECK ON R LEARNPROGRAMMING OR IF YOU KNOW PYTHON ALREADY CHECK HERE
THE SIDEBAR HERE HAS A LOT OF GOOD RESOURCES ALSO MIGHT WANT TO ASK ON R LEARNPYTHON
IF YOU ARE STARTING FROM ZERO OR DON'T HAVE A SOLID BASE I RECOMMEND INTRO TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AFTER THAT COURSE ON WEB PROGRAMMING WITH STEVE HUFFMAN TSH I DON'T KNOW OF THIS SPECIFIC ONE IS STILL ONLINE
TRY R LEARNPYTHON
WRITE AN APP OR A SMALL COMMAND LINE TOOL USING WHAT YOUR LEARNING WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU'RE APPLYING WHICH AUTOMATICALLY HELPS WITH RETENTION NOT TO MENTION IT'S FUN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY NOT WORKING ALSO POST QUESTIONS IN R LEARNPYTHON NEXT TIME
THE TITLE PRETTY MUCH EXPLAINS MY PREDICAMENT

THE TITLE EXPLAINS YOUR PREDICAMENT ABOUT AS WELL AS BIRDS AND BEES EXPLAIN PROCREATION WE GET THE IDEA BUT THE DETAILS ARE A BIT FUZZY
THE NETWORKED ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS WAS FANTASTIC
VERY GOOD JOB
FANTASTIC THANKS FOR SHARING
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING
DID YOU CONSIDER THE CASES WHEN AN AURELIAN JOSE ARCADIA IS REFERRED JUST BY THE FIRST NAME

ALSO
COMPLETELY INTENTIONAL PYTHON FUNCTIONS ARE JUST OBJECTS SO YOU DOING THAT IS BASICALLY EQUIVALENT TO DOING X AND THEN X ALSO THIS IS A QUESTION FOR R LEARNPYTHON ALSO LOOK INTO THIS CHAPTER OF AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF AND THE ENTIRE BOOK REALLY
LOW QUALITY PAMMY HADN'T NOTICED WE'D BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT WELL DONE CATCHING IT ANY WAY WE CAN HELP
JUST BUNCH OF ADS FOR THEIR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE
ALSO IS ONE OF THEIR DOMAINS

THE MODS COULD ALSO LET U MODERATE THE SUBREDDIT WITH POST PERMISSIONS IT'S A MANUALLY UPDATED BLACKLIST THAT AUTOMATICALLY DETECTS MORE POSSIBLE SPAM
GRIN AND FIND PORTED TO PYTHON WITH NO UNICODE PROBLEMS
A DECENT PURE PYTHON CONFIGURATION MANAGER CAN SAVE CONF ON DISK DB INMEMORY WEBSERVICE ETC CAN BE A MICROSERVICE OR NOT LIVE SETTINGS WITH PUB SUB HIERARCHIC OVERRIDING FOR ANY VALUES NAMESPACING WEB CONF EDITOR MARSHMALLOW MODEL DEFINITION FOR VALUES
MOPY WORKING CAUSE RIGHT NOW IT SUCKS
A MODERN ASYNCIO WEB FRAMEWORK THE CURRENT YOUNG PROJECTS AND THE OLD ONES ARE NOT NEARLY A COMPETITOR FOR METEORIS
A PACKAGER FOR PYTHON THAT DEALS WITH COMPILED DEPENDENCIES AND SPIT OUT A STAND ALONE MSI BMG DEBATE
SANS COMPILED DEPENDENCIES
A CEDIS CLONE IN PURE PYTHON FOR DEV AND SMALL PRODS
CELERY BASED ON
AN ADMIN FOR YOUR PYTHON PROJECT INCLUDING A UI FOR REMOTE DEBUGGING BUILD TASKS INSTALLING PACKAGES OUTPUT OF REGULAR RUNS OF FLAKE MOPY LOGS ETC
A MODERN CMS IN PYTHON ACTUALLY A GOOD CMS IN ANYTHING CAUSE CHOTS WP MEZZANINE ARE ALL DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE LOW LEVEL OF CREATIVITY WE HAVE IN THE FIELD COME ON IT'S
A PURE PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION OF BUMPY SO YOU CAN LIST IT AS A DEPENDENCY ANYWHERE EVEN IF IT'S SLOW
A PURE PYTHON IMAGE MANIPULATOR BEING A WRAPPER OF THE OS IMAGE MANIPULATION CAPABILITIES YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DEPEND ON IMAGEMAGICK OR WHATEVER TO MAKE REMISE SHRINK CONVERT FORMATS OR APPLY A FILTER
A TICKET MANAGER THAT IS EMENDED IN PROJECT SAVED IN GIT AND MANAGE WITH A WEBINTERFACE SO YOU DON'T NEED TO HOST IT AND CAN SHARE UPDATES AND COMMENTS WITH GIT PUSH
DECENT TOOLS FOR DEVELOPERS RUBY DEV HAVE CSS PREPROCESSOR JS MINIFIES AND TASKS BUILDER AT THEIR FINGERTIPS JS DEV ARE NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE DESIGNER PEOPLE AVOID PYTHON BECAUSE OF THIS
AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BROWSERSYNC SERVER IN ASYNCIO THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH BROWSERSYNC CLIENT
A BETTER UI FRAMEWORK CIVY AND QT BASED ARE NICE BUT CIVY ISN'T NATIVE AND IS A PAIN TO SET UP ON WINDOWS AND NEITHER ARE NATIVE

IDEALLY I WOULD WANT 2 THINGS A BINDING LIKE LIBBI FOR MOBILE PLATFORMS THEN A PYTHON LIBRARY THAT ALLOWS ONE TO LEVERAGE THESE TWO LIBRARIES ALONG WITH A SAML LIKE SPEC SO THAT ONE CAN WRITE GEIS WITH DECENT GEIS THAT ARE NATIVE FAST AND STILL HAVE THE EASE OF WRITING PYTHON AND THE CONCISENESS THAT COMES FROM LANGUAGES LIKE SAML

I MAY BE THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS THIS BUT I MIGHT TRY TO MAKE IT IF I FIND ENOUGH FREE TIME
AN ASYNCHRONOUS AND PYTHONIC SDL 2 WRAPPER JUST FOR FUN
FACILITIES FOR BUILDING PYTHON CODE WITH C C DEPENDENCIES WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN DISTUTILS IDEALLY A GENERAL PURPOSE BUILD SYSTEM LIKE CAKE AND MESON
SO NOW YOU GOT THE LIST WHAT'S YOUR PLAN
WARNING DO NOT TURN THIS INTO A DRINKING GAME BY TAKING A SHOT EVERY TIME THEY SAY VISUAL STUDIO YOU WILL DIE
AFFILIATE SPAM
WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM WITH THE GENERATOR IT'S SHORTER AND EASIER TO READ AND NO EXPLANATION FOR WHY IT'S INFERIOR WAS GIVEN AS FAR AS I COULD SEE

IMPLEMENTING A STACK YOURSELF IS A BAD IDEA IN MY EXPERIENCE RECURSION IS FINE AND IF YOUR DATA STRUCTURE IS NESTED ENOUGH FOR IT NOT TO BE YOU PROBABLY NEED TO RETHINK SOMETHING
THIS IS A COOL PATTERN THAT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF OR SEEN BEFORE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE IF SO I'D SUGGEST COMPARING THIS PATTERN WITH THE FAMILIAR ITERATIVE DFS IMPLEMENTATION

DEF DFS ROOT
STACK ROOT
WHILE STACK
NODE


FROM WHAT I CAN TELL YOUR STACK OF ITERATORS SOLUTION HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF SAVING MEMORY WHEN THE TREE IS WIDE SINCE IT ESSENTIALLY STORES ONE ITERATOR PER LEVEL OF THE CURRENT DEPTH OF THE SEARCH WHEREAS THE ABOVE WILL STORE MANY MORE NODES IN THE STACK IF THE TREE IS VERY NARROW A CHAIN FOR INSTANCE THEN BOTH APPROACHES CAN STORE EVERY NODE SO IN THE WORST CASE BOTH APPROACHES TAKE O N MEMORY

THE SEEMS REALLY COUNTER INTUITIVE TO ME

FOR NODE IN STACK
ITER CHILDREN NODE
BREAK
ELSE


AND COULD BE REPLACED WITH A EQUIVALENT AND MORE CLEAR IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN


TRY
NODE NEXT STACK
EXCEPT STOPITERATION

ELSE
ITER CHILDREN NODE
WHILE INTERESTING I DO FEEL LIKE I'M MISSING A CONCLUSION AT THE RETURN STATEMENT OF THE ARTICLE
FOR YOUR SEARCH EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETURN BEFORE YOU CHECK IF IT'S A DICT JUST IN CASE THE FIRST VALUE YOU GET IS YOUR MATCH
NEEDED THAT AT THE EXACT MOMENT THIS POPPED UP IN MY REDDIN YOU ARE A KING
DO YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A WAY TO FIND THE SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS POSTED

I WANTED A WAY TO QUICKLY SPIN UP A CUSTOM GRAPHQL BACKEND ON ASW LAMBDA DYNAMODB I LIKED PYNAMODB FOR WORKING WITH DYNAMODB SO I INTEGRATED IT WITH THE POPULAR GRAPHEME LIBRARY

WITH ZAPPA LOADING A FLASK APP TO ASW LAMBDA IS VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD AS WELL
I'M A BOT BLEEP BLOOP SOMEONE HAS LINKED TO THIS THREAD FROM ANOTHER PLACE ON REDDIN

R GRAPHQL MINUTES TO A CUSTOM GRAPHQL BACKEND

CIRC THERE WERE SOME ISSUES WITH HOW MUCH BANDWIDTH THE RPI CAN HANDLE EITHER VIA ETHERNET OR USB OR A COMBINATION OF THE TWO AT LEAST I THINK THIS WAS THE CASE FOR THE FIRST TWO VERSIONS PERHAPS IT WAS ADDRESSED IN THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE RPI

I MIGHT BE THAT COLLECTING VIDEO THROUGH THE USB PORT IS JUST TOO TAXING ON THE RPI THIS PROBLEM HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HOW THE USB ETHERNET CHIPLET AND ITS DRIVER IS IMPLEMENTED BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE SPECIFICS
WHAT DID YOUR PROFILER SAY
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON WRITING AND READING TO A SERIAL PORT IS A LOT LIKE A SOCKET ON A UNIX MACHINE LOOK AT MYSTERIAL
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE PACKAGE FROM YOUR OS PACKAGE MANAGER

I DON'T USE FEDORA BUT IT SHOULD BE

EUDO YUM INSTALL


WAS IN EXACT SITUATION THIS HELPED IMMEASURABLY
MAKE SURE THE RESOURCES THEY LEARN FROM AREN'T DATED THE LANGUAGE HAS CHANGED A TON OVER THE YEARS I FIRST STARTED PROGRAMMING WITH C WHEN I WAS YOUNG THEN MAYBE YEARS LATER STARTED TAKING ANOTHER STAB AT IT AFTER WORKING AS A PYTHON DEV AND IT'S WAY DIFFERENT THAN I REMEMBER IT'S PRACTICALLY A MANAGED MEMORY LANGUAGE IF YOU PLAN TO USE IT THAT WAY
RESPECT THE SEMICOLON
WAS IN THE SAME SITUATION I STARTED READING C PRIMER AND THEN ACCELERATED C VERY WELL EXPLAINED CONCEPTS IN C PRIMER ITS LONG THO PAGES BUT WORTH READING ACCELERATED C WAS ALSO REALLY GOOD AND CONCISE WITHOUT LEAVING ASIDE IMPORTANT EXPLANATIONS FROM WHAT IVE READ BOOKS ARE THE BEST RESOURCES TO LEARN C WITH THE ADDITION OF THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTATION OF COURSE HOPE THAT HELPS AND GOOD LUCK THERES LOT TO LEARN AND IT WILL BE WEIRD AT FIRST
DON'T TRY TO BITE IT ALL OFF AT ONCE START SMALL AND SPEND THE NEXT YEARS FIGURING OUT THE REST
DON'T LEARN OLD CPP START AT LEAST WITH C AND LOOK AT C YOU GET A LOT OF FEATURES SIMILAR TO PYTHON
MY GOTO PROCEDURE WHEN LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE IS TO READ ONE WELL RECOMMENDED BOOK ON THE SUBJECT AND THEN JUST TO START ON A PROJECT FROM THEN ON I WILL GOOGLE MY WAY THROUGH THE LANGUAGE PROBLEMS I GET

I USED TO READ MULTIPLE BOOKS ON NEW LANGUAGES BUT THAT DIDNT HELP MUCH WHEN YOU READ EVERY FEATURE SEEM EQUALLY IMPORTANT BUT IN FACT OF THE LANGUAGE GIVES YOU OF THE FEATURES YOU ACTUALLY USE SO TOO MUCH THEORY IS MORE NOISE THAN HELP
GET A SHRINK
GET A BOOK A GOOD ONE HAS EXERCISES THAT'S HOW I MADE THE SWITCH
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE POSTED SOME GOOD LEARNING RESOURCES SO I'LL JUST GIVE A BUT OF GENERAL ADVICE C HAS A COUPLE OF GOTCHAS THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR THINGS LIKE AUTOMATIC TYPE COERCION ANTS ACTING AS BOILS FOR INSTANCE UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT AND DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATIONS FOR THINGS LIKE COPY CONSTRUCTORS CAN CAUSE REALLY INSIDIOUS PROBLEMS LOOK UP SOME ARTICLES ON THEM SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FACING AND MAKE SURE YOU SET UP YOUR COMPILER TO GIVE YOU AS MANY WARNINGS AS POSSIBLE USUALLY THIS MEANS USING WALL PEDANTIC AND POSSIBLY ERROR
IT'S GETTING ON A BIT NOW DOESN'T COVER THE LATEST FANCY C ADDITIONS BUT I FOUND THE WROX PRESS C TUTORIAL TO BE AN EXCELLENT INTRODUCTION TO THE FUNDAMENTALS OF C
JUST GOOGLE THE BOOKS THEY ARE ONLINE AS READING THEM AND PRACTICING IS ENOUGH
HAVE YOU EVALUATED OTHER OPTIONS WHY DOES HE NEED C EXACTLY PERFORMANCE HAS HE LOOKED AT BUMPY

I HAVE TRIED A FEW DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

SWIG SUCKS FORGET ABOUT SWIG WEEKS OF WASTED TIME FRICKING WITH MACROS

COTHON IS GREAT AND HAS SOME C SUPPORT

IT'LL SHIT IT'S PANTS IF C THROWS AN UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION THOUGH YOU CAN GET AROUND THIS BY WRITING A PURE C WRAPPER THAT CATCHES EXCEPTIONS THEN WRAPPING THAT IN COTHON EXTRA WORK THOUGH

EVENTUALLY I GAVE UP THREW OUT MY C CODE AND REWROTE EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH IN C AND WRAPPED IT IN COTHON

I HAVE HEARD GOOD THINGS ABOUT

DOC LIBS DEVELOP LIBS PYTHON DOC HEML

AND

HEADSKIN HEADSKIN

I WOULD FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE MOST BLEEDING EDGE VERSION OF THE C STANDARD YOU CAN SUPPORT AND TARGET THAT FOR LEARNING

I KNOW QUESTION WAS HOW TO I LEARN C THE REASON I RESPONDED WITH A BUNCH OF TOOLS IS C IS SUCH A HUGE STANDARD THAT ACCORDING BARNIE STROUSTRUP HIMSELF IT'S TOO BIG FOR ANY ONE PERSON TO LEARN IT ALL SO IT MAKES SENSE TO START WITH THE SUBSET REQUIRED TO USE THE TOOLS YOU NEED RATHER THAN LEARN A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT WON'T DIRECTLY APPLY
YOU CAN USE COTHON TO PRODUCE C C EXTENSIONS USING VERY SYNTAX THOUGH KNOWING SOME C AND MAYBE C IS HELPFUL

HONESTLY IF IT'S AN OPTION CONSIDER STARTING WITH C INSTEAD OF C IF YOU WANT TO BE ANY GOOD AT C YOU NEED TO LEARN VIRTUALLY ALL OF C ANYWAY AND C IS A NICE COMPACT LANGUAGE THAT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND C HAS LOTS OF ADVANCED FEATURES THAT CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER ONCE YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THEM BUT IT IS NOT A WELL-DESIGNED LANGUAGE TO PUT IT MILDLY I USED IT FOR YEARS AND I FOUND MYSELF HAVING TO GOOGLE PRETTY BASIC STUFF TO REMIND MYSELF HOW IT WORKED ALL THE TIME
I'LL REITERATE WHAT OTHER COMMENTERS SAID FIRST AND FOREMOST MAKE SURE YOUR REFERENCES AND LEARNING MATERIALS ARE AT LEAST FROM AND THE MORE RECENT THE BETTER IDIOMATIC C FROM A DECADE AGO IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BEAST FROM C NOW
AH YOU GUYS HAVE KNOCKED THIS OUT OF THE PARK

THANKS FOR ALL THE ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS

I'M NOT THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS TO LEARN C BUT NOW I THINK I MIGHT DO IT ANYWAY
READ SOME TUTORIALS AND WRITE SOME CODE IF YOU KNOW ONE LANGUAGE YOU CAN LEARN THEM ALL YOU'LL BE FINE
I COME FROM THE OLD SCHOOL WHERE YOU INSIST THAT EVERY LANGUAGE OTHER THAN THE ONE YOU KNOW IS INFERIOR SO YOU REFUSE TO LEARN ANYTHING ELSE ON PRINCIPLE SO I CAN'T HELP

I'D PROBABLY LEARN AXE THOUGH IF THERE WAS NO WAY OUT OF THE C REQUIREMENT WHICH TRANSPIRES TO C AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO THE CODE COULD BE IN C BUT THE LANGUAGE USED COULD BE COMPREHENDED MY A MORTAL BEING COME TO THINK OF IT IF YOU LEARNED AXE YOU'D NEVER NEED TO LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE IT'S LIKE THE INVERSE OF PYTHON WHICH CAN IMPORT ANY LANGUAGE
WAIT DID YOU ACCIDENTALLY UPLOAD YOUR IMAGER API CREDENTIALS TO GITHUB IF SO CHANGE THE SECRET KEY
I REALLY LIKE YOUR IDEA BUT THE ARTICLE IS A BIT UNDERWHELMING FIRST YOU POINTED OUT HOW YOU SHOULD APPROACH TASKS AND THINK ALGORITHMICALLY THEN PASTED A PART OF YOUR CODE AND FINALLY STATED THAT YOU USED INSTEAD OF THE YOUTUBE API HOWEVER THE LATTER IS BETTER WRITING ARTICLES IS HARD AND TAKES PRACTICE AND IT WILL BE BETTER EVENTUALLY
AS FOR YOUR BOT I THINK YOU COULD IMPLEMENT A WAY TO SEARCH FOR CUTS IN THE VIDEO OR LOOTABLE PARTS AND MAKE YOUR GIBS ACCORDING TO THAT
WHAT MAKES THIS A BOT AS COMPARED TO JUST A SCRIPT IT ONLY DOES ONE THING RIGHT IS THERE ANY INTERACTION AFTER THE INITIAL START
GET THAT CAMELCASE NONSENSE OUT OF HERE THIS IS PYTHON MY FRIEND
FUN TIMES AT HEADQUARTERS I HEAR THEN
OME

THIS GIST CLAIMS TO WORK WITH PYTHONISSA A PYTHON IDE FOR IOS WITH A BUNCH OF CUSTOM CLASSES FOR INTERACTING WITH IOS DEVICES

CAN'T CONFIRM IT BUT MAYBE IT'S WORTH A LOOK
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON
MIGHT ALSO BE HELPFUL

HELLO

YOU ARE PROBABLY IN PYTHON SO THATS WHAT HAPPENS

PYTHON DEC MSC VERB BIT INTEL ON WIN
TYPE COPYRIGHT CREDITS OR LICENSE FOR MORE INFORMATION
PIP INSTALL
SYNTAXERROR INVALID SYNTAX

BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT FROM YOUR COMMAND LINE

C USERS LICHA PIP INSTALL

I THINK PYTHON IS TRYING TO SEND THE WHOLE DOWNLOADS FOLDER TO THE TRASH TRY USING TO RETURN THE FILES AND FOLDERS INSIDE DOWNLOADS AND SEND THOSE TO THE TRASH I'VE ONLY BEEN USING PYTHON FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW SO THIS MIGHT NOT WORK BUT IN MY HEAD IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE
SEND SEND C USERS MYUSERNAME DOWNLOADS
THIS MIGHT NOT SOLVE IT BUT YOUR ESCAPING IS WRONG IN THE PATH YOU'RE PASSING TO SEND YOU NEED TO DOUBLE THE SINGLE BACKSLASHES
FROM THE DOCS THE USAGE SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS

FROM SEND IMPORT SEND
SEND

HERE IS A PATH TO A FILE AS VCTEMC RECOMMENDED TRY USING TO GET A LIST OF FILES AND ITERATE THROUGH THOSE LIKE THIS

FOR ITEM IN
SEND ITEM

TAKE CARE WITH PATHS IN WINDOWS
I'M WITH U RCKLMBR ON THIS ONE FOR TASKS LIKE WEB SCRAPING PROCESSES ARE THE WRONG APPROACH I WOULDN'T BOTHER WITH ASYNC IN THIS CASE THOUGH BECAUSE HAS A LOVELY INTERFACE FOR THREADS

FOR AN EMBARRASSINGLY PARALLEL PROBLEM YOU SHOULD ALSO AVOID MUCKING AROUND WITH FUTURES DIRECTLY JUST USE FULL EXAMPLE

IMPORT
WITH THREADPOOLEXECUTOR AS POOL
RESULTS LIST PARSE BURLS

THIS HAS EXACTLY THE SAME EFFECT AS THE SNIPPET IN THE FIRST EXAMPLE IN AS MANY LINES OF CODE INCLUDING THE IMPORT STATEMENT AND RUNS ALMOST TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE FASTER
GOOD ARTICLE BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY INEFFICIENT FOR SCRAPING YOU'D WANT TO USE PROCESSPOOLEXECUTOR WHEN YOU WANT TO SPREAD WORK TO MULTIPLE PROCESSES BUT GENERALLY WHEN WEBSCRAPING YOU'RE NOT CPU BOUND USING ASYNCIO AND AIOHTTP AND PROBABLY A SEMAPHORE WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER SUITED FOR THIS
YOU CAN MAKE AN OBJECT THAT WORKS A BIT LIKE IT

CLASS RANGER
DEF SELF SLICES
FIRST SECOND ELLI LAST SLICES
IF ELLI IS NOT ELLIPSIS
RAISE TYPEERROR
INTERVAL SECOND FIRST
RETURN RANGE FIRST LAST INTERVAL

R RANGER
R
RANGE 2

COULD BE EXPANDED TO PRODUCE HAVE DEFAULT PARAMETERS AND THEN YOU COULD PUT IT ON PM PEPI
JUST DO RANGE
IT'S COOL BUT IT'S NOT SUPER PYTHONIC TO MY EYES

HOWEVER IF YOU TURNED THIS INTO A LITTLE LIBRARY I HAVE A FEELING YOU'D GET QUITE A FEW DOWNLOADS ON PEPI
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE RANGE
MPH
PERL CALLED THEY WANT THEIR GARBAGE BACK
YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE HELP AT R LEARNPYTHON
YOU'LL HAVE THE MOST FLEXIBILITY IF YOU CONSIDER CORDOVA INSTEAD OF EITHER CIVY LOCKS YOU INTO PYTHON IONIC LOCKS YOU INTO ANGULAR

CORDOVA LETS YOU CHOOSE TO WORK WITH WHATEVER FRONTED AND BACKEND TECH YOU WANT AND PACKAGE IT AS A WEBVIEW STYLE APPARENTLY JS NATIVEAPI BRIDGES COME IN THE FORM OF PLUGGING
CIVY IS PURELY APP DEVELOPMENT FROM THE GLIMPSE OF ITS WEBSITE WHILE IONIC IS MORE TOWARDS HEML FRONTED AND ANGULAR FRAMEWORK
SHAMELESSLY PLUGGING AN ALTERNATIVE NOW THAT THERE ARE BETA WHEELS OF PREGAME AVAILABLE IT'S VERY EASY TO CREATE AN INSTALLER USING PYNSIST YOU CAN EVEN MAKE A WINDOWS INSTALLER FROM A LINUX SYSTEM

TAKLUYVER PYNSIST TREE MASTER EXAMPLES PREGAME
BEEWARE HAS A WINDOWS SHIPPING THING TOO I THINK
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A HOMEWORK PROBLEM

CHECK OUT R LEARNPYTHON
THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING ALSO YT HAS THE VIDEO SPEED CONTROLS SO I CAN SPEED UP PLAYBACK LOVE THIS PODCAST
