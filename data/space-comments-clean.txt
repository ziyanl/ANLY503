DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE RUSSIANS REFER TO AS NAPHTHYL I'M SKIMMING THROUGH THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THEIR UDMH PRODUCER IN SALAMAT AND SEEING REFERENCES TO AN RP REPLACEMENT FUEL
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUICK REFERENCES PICS OR FACTS TO ABSOLUTELY SHUT DOWN ANY FLAT ARTHER PERSON INSTANTANEOUSLY SHE IS DRIVING ME INSANE
WHAT'S TO STOP A PRIVATE COMPANY FROM SLAPPING TOGETHER AN EFFICIENT EM DRIVE NOW THAT THEY APPEAR TO WORK STRAPPING IT ONTO A SMALL CRAFT THROWING IN A BUNCH OF TEST EQUIPMENT I EAST TELESCOPES AND SPECTROMETERS AND HD CAMERAS AND FIRING THAT THING OUT TOWARDS ALPHA CENTAURI

WE COULD TAKE CRAZY GOOD MEASUREMENTS OF STUFF ON THE WAY AS WELL
I KNOW THIS IS A VERY BASIC QUESTION BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT THIS THREAD IS FOR

HOW DO ASTRONAUTS GET ONTO THE ISS IT'S TRAVELLING AT THE BEST PART OF KM H I CANNOT FATHOM HOW THEY'D GET ON AND OFF THAT THING

IS IT A CASE OF THE CRAFT USED TO GET THEM THERE GOING AT EXACTLY THE SAME SPEED SO IT'S RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO CONNECT THE TWO I JUST THINK THERE MUST BE MUCH MORE TO IT

THANKS
LETS SAY A COMPANY LIKE SPACE IS SPENDING BILLIONS A YEAR ON R AND D I UNDERSTAND STUFF LIKE INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL IS FAR OFF BUT WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THE COMPANY DISCOVERS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NOT DISCOVERED YET IS THIS POSSIBLE OR IS IT JUST WISHFUL THINKING I REALLY WANT TO SEE INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL IN MY LIFETIME AND BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SPACE TOURISM
HOW COME WE CANNOT FIND THE RUMORED 9TH PLANET OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM YET WE HAVE FOUND MILLIONS OF EXOPLANETS

QUESTIONS ABOUT STRANGE STARS METALLIC STARS NEUTRINO STARS AND BLACK HOLES

I RECENTLY CAME TO UNDERSTAND STARS BETTER DUE TO VARIOUS REASONS INCLUDING WIKIPEDIA BLITZES AND ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD A STRANGE STAR TO HAVE STRANGE QUARKS AND KNEW OF STRANGE WEIRD ABILITY TO PACK DIFFERENTLY DUE TO LEARNING ABOUT STRANGE NUCLEI

NOW THERE IS MENTION OF STRANGE STARS BEING A LATE STAGE OF NEUTRONS STARS WHERE UP DOWN QUARKS GET TRANSFORMED INTO SOME STRANGE MATTER TO LOWER POTENTIAL ENERGY NEVER CONSIDERED THAT AND WITH MY NEWER INTEREST IN THE MECHANICS THAT DRIVE STARS MASS VERSUS PRESSURE AND RELIEVING PRESSURE BY CONVERTING MATTER

I HAVE ALSO HEAR MENTION TO STARS BEING PURE EM A SOME SCALE

BUT MY QUESTION IS AT WHAT POINT WOULD QUARK TRANSLATION EQUAL A DENSITY CLOSE TO A BLACK HOLE AND COULD WE USE THIS TO DETERMINE THE END OF THE QUARK GENERATIONS IE ARE TOP AND BOTTOM THE END AND COULD THE USE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE AND THE IDEA THAT A NEUTRON STAR MAY PASS THROUGH NUMEROUS INSTANTANEOUS CONVERSIONS TO HEAVIER MATTER FORMS FROM THE PRIMITIVE TIMES JUST AS IT'S IRON CORE FLASHES THROUGH YET UNKNOWN HEAVY ELEMENTS BEFORE HITTING SOME OUTRIGHT CRASH POINT BE USED TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE EARLY UNIVERSE AND ALL MATTER FROM THE EMR PRODUCED

IF YOU HAD A LARGE ENOUGH PURE IRON CORE COULD YOU REACH A NEW FUSION EPOCH OR IS THAT AGE A RAPID EXPLOSIVE ONE TOWARDS A NEUTRON STAR OR WOULD IT MERELY EXPLODE AS DUST H HE TUNNELS THROUGH THE IRON BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE ENERGY POTENTIAL DRIVING IT TO THE CENTER WHERE IT IGNITES AND BECOMES A STAR

NEUTRINO MASS IS APPARENTLY INSIGNIFICANT IN THE UNIVERSE BUT THEY MUST SLOWLY FORM FLOWS AS THEY WEAKLY INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO FORM STARS

IF A STAR POSSIBLE A QUARK STAR WHATEVER QUARKS ACTUALLY ARE THAT THEY COMPOSE MATTER AT SPECIFIC RATIOS WHAT SHOULD A BLACK HOLE BURN CONVERT GLUONS BOSONS SOME FORCE MODULATOR WE DON'T KNOW THAT DETERMINES SOME FACTOR OF SPACETIME

QUESTION ABOUT THE EM DRIVE MY FRIEND CLAIMS THAT AS LONG AS IT PRODUCES THRUST VIA ANY METHOD THEN ITS ALL GOOD HE READS NOTHING BUT PRESUMES HE KNOWS EVERYTHING

I ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE READ EVERYTHING I CAN FIND ON THIS AND I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S HOPED FOR AND ANY ANOMALIES IN THE MEASUREMENTS DUE TO THERMAL RADIATION OR WHATEVER

HE'S CLAIMING WHATEVER WAY IT PRODUCES THRUST BE IT VIA MICROWAVES OR THERMAL RADIATION MY WORDING IT STILL WORKS BETTER THAN OTHER METHODS LIKE SOLAR SAILS OR ION DRIVES

WHO'S RIGHT

IF IT DOES PRODUCE THRUST VIA THERMAL RADIATION WOULD THIS ACTUALLY WORK AS A VIABLE PROPULSION METHOD AND NOT DEGRADE THE ENGINE OVER TIME DUE TO PHOTON HEAT OR WHATEVER
WOULD HUMAN BEINGS BE ABLE TO SEE NEBULAE AS THEY LOOK IN PICTURES I'VE NOTICED PEOPLE TAKE PICTURES OF SPACE OBJECTS LIKE THE ORION NEBULA THROUGH HOURS OF EXPOSURE

WHILE THE IMAGES ARE HIGHLY DETAILED WOULD A HUMAN BEING AS FAR AS A FEW LIGHT YEARS IN SPACE EVER BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THESE OBJECTS WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF CLARITY
THIS IS PROBABLY THE LEAST SMARTEST QUESTION ON HERE BUT WHY ARE GALAXIES SHAPED DIFFERENTLY IS IT A CAUSE OF DIFFERENT GRAVITY DIFFERENT WAYS THEY WERE CREATED
I JUST RECENTLY HEARD ABOUT ELON IDEA OF NUKING MARS TO BRING BACK IT'S ATMOSPHERE HOW DOES THIS WORK IS IT FEASIBLE
I FOUND THIS ARTICLE FROM

ARTICLE

ABOUT THROWING LAUNCHING TRASH BACKWARD FROM THE SPACE STATION TO LET ATMOSPHERIC DRAG SLOWLY DEORBIT THE TRASH DID THEY DECIDE TO ACTUALLY DO THIS

ALSO HOW ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE A SAILBOAT DRIFT ANCHOR TO HELP DRAG THE TRASH DOWN
ABOUT ROCKETS THAT PUT SATELLITES IN ORBIT AROUND EARTH DO ALL ENGINES OF THE ROCKET RETURN THEMSELVES TO TRAJECTORIES AFTER PUTTING SATELLITES IN ORBIT OR DO THE SATELLITES PUT THEMSELVES INTO ORBIT FROM A TRAJECTORY

AND REMAINING IN THE DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE SPACE JUNK HOW MANY OF THE ENGINES FOR MISSIONS END UP AS SPACE JUNK IF THEY DO NOT END UP AS SPACE JUNK WHERE DO WE CRASH THE ENGINES
IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT MARS IS CURRENTLY IN A PHASE SIMILAR TO A SNOWBALL EARTH IN WHICH SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE IT COULD GET WARMER
IF GRAVITY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH IS MS 2 WHAT IS THE GRAVITY IGNORING THE MOON ACCELERATION TOWARDS THE SUN AND WHAT IS THE GRAVITY IGNORING THE SUN ACCELERATION TOWARDS THE MOON
IF A SUPERMOON IS WHEN THE MOON PASSES CLOSE TO EARTH DURING A FULL MOON THEN WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE EVENT WHEN THE MOON PASSES CLOSE TO EARTH DURING A NEW MOON
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE MOON LANDING HAPPENED IN PART DUE TO POLITICS THE US HAD TO BEAT THE RUSSIANS AFTER THEY SENT THE FIRST HUMAN TO SPACE I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STILL FUND NASA AS WELL AS ENCOURAGE ANY AND ALL INITIATIVES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS A SPECIES WE MUST BECOME OR WE WILL DIE OFFICIAL IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
WHEN EUROPEANS DECIDED TO GET THE HELL JUTA DODGE AND EXPLORE THE WORLD THEY WERE PRIVATE MERCHANTS SANCTIONED AND PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THEIR MONARCHS IS IT TIME FOR NASA JPL ETC TO BE DISMANTLED OVER TIME AND LET THE PRIVATE COMPANIES WITH GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT TO TAKE OVER OUR NEXT STEPS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION

IT JUST SEEMS THAT POLITICAL BUREAUCRACY HAS CONSTANTLY GOTTEN IN THE WAY SINCE THE LAST MOON LANDING

I THINK ONE OF THE CRAZIEST THINGS ABOUT IMAGES LIKE THIS IS THAT THE CAMERA IS A MASTERPIECE OF ENGINEERING IT GOES FROM ONE TEMPERATURE EXTREME TO ANOTHER EVERY HOUR THE MATH ON ALL THE THERMAL EXPANSION IS AMAZING
I CLAIM THIS HILL IN THE NAME OF THE QUEEN I WILL CALL IT LITTLE BRITAIN HILL
COOL PUTS THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF WATER BEING ON MARS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT AT ALL HERE
WOULD THAT HAPPEN TO BE FROM THE ONE IN AMARILLO A WHILE BACK HETP
YOOOOOO CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY AND HOW THIS HAPPENS TO A PERSON
STEVEN HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU DO NOT FUCKING SUMMON THAT THING IN MY HOUSE
WELL NOW THAT CALAMITY IS IN ORBIT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL WE START SEEING EPICS
WOW THOSE THINGS ARE A LOT BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT FROM READING ABOUT THEM I HOPE I SEE ONE SOMEDAY
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE IT'S SO RARE TO SEE THESE PHOTOGRAPHED AS YOU NEED JUST THE RIGHT CONDITIONS TO EVEN SEE THEM LET ALONE HAVE THEM OCCUR

HELLUVA SHOT THESE DON'T LAST LONG EITHER REALLY GET A FEEL FOR THE SIZE OF THOSE THINGS WITH THIS SHOT

WHEN I'M BORED I GO OVER TO R THEWORLDISFLAT TO READ THE CRAZY SHIT PEOPLE POST SO THIS MAKES ME SMILE DAT CURVE THO
I NEVER KNEW THAT RED SPRITES WERE SO LARGE I JUST ASSUMED THEY WERE QUITE SMALL FEATURES
TX OK AND NORTHERN MEXICO IS PICTURED IN THIS YOU CAN SEE THE GV CORPUS CHRISTI SAN ANTONIO AUSTIN DFW HOUSTON MIDLAND ODESSA LUBBOCK LAREDO OK TULSA MONTERREY AND I BELIEVE EL PASO UNDER THE CLOUDS
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PICTURE IS THAT A REFLECTION OF THE MOON ON THE OCEAN IF SO THAT IS AWE SOME IT'S FUNNY HOW THE REFLECTION APPEARS THE SAME SIZE FROM SPACE AS IT DOES WHEN LEADING ON A POND PUDDLE LAKE ETC
SOVIET COSMONAUTS USED TO USE THE CODE I AM OBSERVING THUNDERSTORMS TO SIGNIFY THAT THEIR CRAFT WAS EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THUNDERSTORMS LOOKS AMAZING FROM ORBIT THIS LED TO SOME PERFECTLY FUNCTIONAL MISSIONS ALMOST BEING ABORTED BEFORE THE COSMONAUT CLARIFIED WHAT THEY MEANT
IS THAT THE MOON JUST ABOVE THE HORIZON
THE CITY LIGHTS LOOK A BIT BLURRY WHILE THE STARS SEEM SHARP WHAT IS CAUSING THAT THE ATMOSPHERE
I KEEP FORGETTING THAT SPRITE ISN'T JUST A SODA CLICK BAITED FROM MY IGNORANCE
HAHA WOW I'M SUBSCRIBED TO R FLIGHTSIM AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS A PICTURE FROM THERE SO I CLOSED IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY I HAD TO DO A
I'M MORE OF A CLASSIC SPRITE GUY I MEAN RED SPRITE IS GOOD BUT YOU CAN'T BEAT LEMON LIME
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME HOW PHOTOSHOPPED THAT PICTURE IS OR IS THAT MORE OR LESS CLOSE TO REALITY
ALL OF THAT LIGHT POLLUTION DRIVES ME CRAZY IT'S NOTHING BUT A WASTE WERE TRYING TO ILLUMINATE SPACE
I ONLY RECENTLY FOUND OUT ABOUT SPRITES RIDICULOUSLY GORGEOUS PHENOMENON MOTHER NATURE IS LIT
A PHYSICS TEACHER ONCE TOLD US THESE SPRITES CAN APPEAR SEEMINGLY RANDOMLY BALL LIGHTNING
OH OH OH CAN ANYBODY TELL ME WHAT REGION THIS IS TAKEN ABOVE AKA WHAT CITIES ARE WE LOOKING AT I KNOW BUT DO YOU
HERE IS A HINT I DOES SEEM TO BE NIGHT AND THERE ARE A LOT OF LARGE AND LUMINOUS STARS ABOVE THIS REGION
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSAL PICTURES INTRO IN THE MOVIES
I WAS HONESTLY EXPECTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS
KIND OF UNRELATED BUT WHAT'S THE GREEN CIRCULAR CURVE I ASSUME IT'S THE ATMOSPHERE OR SOME LAYER OF IT BUT WHY DOES IT APPEAR TO GET THICKER THE FURTHER AWAY FROM EARTH IS THAT AN EFFECT OF THE LIGHT OR A RESULT OF THE ATMOSPHERE'S COMPOSITION WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OUTER BORDER
I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING TO SEE A RED SPRITE BOTTLE IN SPACE BEFORE OPENING THE PICTURE THIS IS GOOD THOUGH
THAT IS A COOL PICTURE I VE NEVER SEEN A PICTURE OF THIS PHENOMENON IN CONTEXT LIKE THIS BEFORE THANK YOU
THEY SHOULD MAKE A RED SPRITE LIKE SPRITE WITH A HINT OF CHERRY FLAVOR OR PERHAPS RASPBERRY SPRITE
XJREGQI I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S A FLOATING HEAD DEFINITELY NOT A SPRITE
OBVIOUSLY A FAKE IMAGE THE SUN ISN'T EVEN YELLOW WAKE UP SHEEPLET



THIS IS SATIRE
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL SHOT FANCY ALSO SUBMITTING IT TO R PLANETEARTH
WHAT IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND THE GREEN LINE IN THIS PICTURE
THIS REMINDS ME OF A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THUNDERSTORMS I SAW A LONG TIME AGO IT HAD A STRONG EMPHASIS ON HOW YOU CAN SEE A RED FLASH FROM SPACE MOMENTS BEFORE LIGHTING WOULD STRIKE CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME BUT IF ANYONE KNOWS THIS PHENOMENON PLEASE ELABORATE
ANYONE HAVE ANY THEORIES ON WHAT THE GOLD STREAKING IN THE TOP RIGHT IS
THIS IS A STUPID QUESTION BUT ARE THE LIGHT SPLOTCHES IN THE TOP RIGHT CORNER REFLECTIONS
DON'T TELL ME IT'S SPRITE WHEN IT'S REALLY SIERRA MIST I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE
ARE THOSE BIG CITIES DALLAS HOUSTON AUSTIN AND SAN ANTONIO LOOKING TOWARD THE EAST
WAIT WAIT WAIT SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THAT RED CLAW LOOKING PORTAL IS A SPRITE I'M TELLING YOU THE OTHER ARE COMING TO TAKE OUR JOBS
I TRIED TO CLEAN MY LAPTOP SCREEN OF DUST TO SEE BETTER TURNS OUT IT WAS THE COSMOS
RED SPRITE

OH LIKE THAT MANGA THAT REPLACED BLEACH AND GOT CANCELLED AFTER 2 MONTHS
IN ALL OF THE INFINITE UNIVERSE I BET THERE'S SOME GROUP LIKE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY JUST ROLLING ABOUT UP THERE
SO QUESTION THAT YELLOW THING AROUND EARTH IS OUR ATMOSPHERE RIGHT IS THAT VISIBLE TO THE HUMAN EYE OR ONLY WITH PICTURES
THE PATTERN REMINDS ME OF THE INTERFERENCE PATTERN FROM THE DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT IS THERE ANY RELATION
SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE FIRST TIME GAMES PRODUCE HIGHER RES AND CLEARER PHOTOS OF PLANETS THAN AN ASTRONAUT WITH A SPACE CAMERA
DOES GAS COMPOSITION IN THE ATMOSPHERE CHANGE AT DIFFERENT ALTITUDES BEING FROM A CHEMIST BACKGROUND ELECTRONS BECOMING EXCITED FROM THE ENERGY TRANSFERRED CAUSES THEM TO EMIT DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT LIKE DIFFERENT METALS USED IN FIREWORKS TO PRODUCE DIFFERENT COLORS THE SKY IS BLUE BECAUSE OF THE HYDROGEN SO MAYBE DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAS IN HIGHER PRESENCE CAUSES DIFFERENCE COLORS OF LIGHT
HOW ARE STARS SO CLOSE TO THE SUN MOON THING VISIBLE WHEN THE LIGHT IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE EVERYTHING LOOK DARK AS SEEN IN MOST PICTURES
THE REAL QUESTION IS CAN YOU HEAR WHEN THIS HAPPENS CAUSE ONE DAY I WAS WATCHING A THUNDERSTORM THAT SENT A BOLT ACROSS THE SKY LIKE WAY UP THERE WITH A VERY LOUD BANG BUT INSTEAD OF RUMBLING AFTER IT JUST STARTED DOING THIS STATIC SPITING TYPE NOISE LIKE THE SOUND WAS JUST BOTTOMING OUT FOR LIKE SECONDS AND I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY O THERE WAS A ELF RIDING THAT ONE THEY ONLY COME OUT FOR THE RADICAL HIGH ALTITUDE STORMS HOW DO I GET REDDIN TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS

EDIT CAN YOU HEAR A ELF
SOME OF THEM LOOK LIKE DEEP SEA SQUID OR SOMETHING LOVECRAFTIAN EMERGING FROM THE VOID
WAIT A SEC I THOUGHT REAL PHOTOS TAKEN IN SPACE DON'T SHOW STAR LIGHT IN THE BACKGROUND

IS THIS LIKE A PHOTO TAKEN WHILE STILL IN A LAYER OF THE ATMOSPHERE
SO IT'S NOT A PIRATE TURNING THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN AND RETURNING FROM THE WORLD'S END
THERE WAS A SUBREDDIT FOR ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA LIKE THIS WHAT WAS IT CALLED AGAIN
WOULDN'T IT JUST BE LIKE PLASMA SIMILAR TO HOW PUTTING A MATCH IN A MICROWAVE WORKS
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A PHOTO OF THIS IS INCREDIBLE MEANWHILE WE KILL EACH OTHER AND CREATE MEMES
I'M MORE OF A UP ABOVE A BLACK LIGHT OF A PASSIVE THUNDERSTORM TYPE OF GUY

GREAT SHOT COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO DOES OKAY PHOTOGRAPHY FROM THE GROUND FLOOR UP
I LOVE SEEING THESE PICTURES THINGS THAT WERE ONLY POSITED TO EXIST BUT HAD NO DOCUMENT ABILITY MY ENTIRE LIFE SUDDENLY IN FRONT OF ME

MAYBE I JUST HAVEN'T KEPT READING ENOUGH BUT WOULDN'T THEY MAKE SENSE THAT LIGHTNING IS BOTH GROUNDED AT THE GROUND AND ON THE EDGE OF OUR MAGNETOSPHERE IONOSPHERE MAKING A CIRCUIT OF SORTS PLEASE EXCUSE MY ABSOLUTE LACK OF FORMAL KNOWLEDGE JUST CAN'T SEEM TO CONFIRM OR PUT THIS ONE TO REST THAT I KNOW OF
THATS DEFINITELY AN A H BOMB WITH THAT WHITISH LIGHT OVER ON THE LEFT SIDE WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE
SO WHICH PARAGON OF REDDIN ALREADY FIGURED OUT WHAT PART OF THE WORLD THIS IS I'LL GRANT YOU ONE ARROW-SHAPED VIRTUAL
SORRY IF I MISSED THIS BUT WHERE DID THIS PICTURE COME FROM WHAT CAMERA TOOK IT
MIGHT BE LATE ON THIS BUT CURIOUS WOULD A HUMAN STILL SEE THE CITY MAN-MADE LIGHTS FROM SPACE AS WELL AS IN THIS PIC I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED IF THOSE PICTURES OF EARTH AT NIGHT ARE REALLY WHAT SOMEONE IN SPACE WOULD SEE OR IF IT'S REALLY JUST DARK TO THE HUMAN EYE
IT'S ONE OF MY DREAMS TO EVER SEE ONE IN REAL LIFE WHICH IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE CONSIDERING THE CHANCES AND THE SHORT DURATION OF THE FLASHES
HOW WAS THIS PHOTO TAKEN WHAT I'M THINKING IS THAT I HAD THOUGHT RED SPRITES WERE FAINT AND CITY LIGHTS ARE QUITE BRIGHT SO PRETTY AMAZING TO ME YOU CAN SEE BOTH IN THE SAME PHOTO

VIDEO COMMENT

RED SPRITE BURSTS REALTIME SLOW MOTION SUPERCELL LIGHTNING STORM HERE'S A FEW MORE FROM SCOTT MCPARTLAND
THE SUN AND STORMS MAY 2 THERE IS ONE POSSIBLE THEORY THAT SPRITES AND KOBOLDS ARE THE VISIBLE PART OF THE ENERGY FLOWING FROM THE SUN INTO THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE IT IS ALREADY PROVEN BUT NOT YET ACCEPTED THAT SOLAR STORMS AND OME CAN INCREASE THE SIZE AND STRENGTH OF STORM
MYSTERY OF THE RED SPRITES I FOUND THIS AID ON MY PERSONAL RESEARCH ON THIS STUFF EXPLAINS IT PRETTY GOOD IMO
SOLAR STORMS EARTH STORMS LANDSLIDE NEWS SEP BECAUSE OF EARTHS MAGNETIC FIELD THE SOLAR RADIATION WRAPS AROUND THE EARTH AT THE NIGHT SIGHT USUALLY WITH A GREATER DISTANCE AND THERE IS STILL THE VAN ALLEN BELT THAT IS ALSO A GREAT INFLUENCE HERE IS NOTED THAT THE VAN ALLEN BELT SCATTERS THE
ENDOCAST RED SPRITES HERE'S THE ORIGINAL SOURCE FROM EUROPEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY ENDOCAST RED SPRITES
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTARY LIGHTNING SPRITES AT THE EDGE OF SPACE BBC DISCOVERY POSSIBLY THIS ONE
BBC AT THE EDGE OF SPACE FULL HD SO SEEING THIS AND DOING RESEARCH ENTHRALLED ME FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE THIS IS AN HOUR LONG DOCUMENTARY ABOUT SPRITES THE LINK TAKES YOU TO THEIR FIRST CAPTURE OF SPRITES
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH I'LL KEEP THIS UPDATED AS LONG AS I CAN

PLAY ALL INFO GET ME ON CHROME FIREBOX
SO SEEING THIS AND DOING RESEARCH ENTHRALLED ME FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE THIS IS AN HOUR LONG DOCUMENTARY ABOUT SPRITES THE LINK TAKES YOU TO THEIR FIRST CAPTURE OF SPRITES
IM PRETTY SHURE THAT THEY ARE SMALL PLASMA DISCHARGES FROM THE LIGHTNINGS
DEPRESSING HOW MUCH SURFACE AREA IS BUILT ON WHEN YOU SEE IT AT THIS SCALE


I SEE NO RED SPRITE NOT EVEN A CLEAR PEPSI CLICKS ON DIFFERENT POST
WIKI

EVERYTHING NASA AND YOU SCIENCE NERDS KNOW ABOUT SPACE IS WRONG
LOOKS LIKE LENS FLARE TO ME LIGHT FROM THE MOON REFLECTING INSIDE THE CAMERA LENSES
CURIOUS WORD USED TO DESCRIBE IT SPRITE I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT FOR A BRIEF MOMENT THESE SPRITES ARE ALIVE SELF-AWARE AND ONLY HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO EXPERIENCE THE IMMEDIATE END OF THEIR EXISTENCE

WORD CLOUD OUT OF ALL THE COMMENTS HETP

I HOPE YOU LIKE IT
HEY YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL WITH THE TERM SPRITE AS A GAMER I WAS INTRIGUED BY YOUR POST WHEN I SAW IT IN R ALL BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT WASN'T ABOUT VIDEO GAMES JUST A HEADS UP TO MAKE REDDIN BETTER FOR ALL OF US
THE HUMAN BODY IS PRETTY MUCH A SEALED CONTAINER AND IT WOULD TAKE A WHILE FOR ATROPHY TO SET IN INA VACUUM HOW LONG COULD A HUMAN LAST IN A VACUUM IF THEY HAD A PRESSURIZED AND CLOSED-DOOR SEALED OXYGEN MASK
HERO REALLY FOR PUTTING HIMSELF AT SUCH GREAT RISK THE FAKED MOON LANDINGS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED OTHERWISE
THERE IS GRAVITY ON THE MOON JUST NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS ON EARTH THE SAND NOT FALLING IMMEDIATELY IS MORE EVIDENCE THAT IT IS IN SPACE
STAR TREK AWAY MISSIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE FUN IN LOW GRAVITY

OH SHIT I DROPPED MY TRICORDER

ENSIGN DO YOU DETECT ANY LIFE SIGNS

JUST A SECOND CAPTAIN TWO STEPS BACK AND JUMP KNEEL DAM IT JUST LIKE IN TRAINING BALLOCKS ONE MORE TIME

ENSIGN THOSE READINGS

AAAA THERE IS TO MUCH INTERFERON RADIATION TO GET A READING ONE SEC I WILL TRY TO COMPENSATE AND JUMP KNEEL GREAT NOW I HAVE FALLEN AND CAN'T GET UP ENTERPRISE ONE EMERGENCY BEAM UP
I'M LEFT HANDED BUT SEEING PEOPLE DO THINGS LEFT HANDED LOOKS SO AWKWARD ESPECIALLY IN SPACE
HAHA I LAUGHED SO HARD

I'M SURE HE DIDN'T GET THIS AT TRAINING

NASA PICKING UP THE HAMMER AKA HAMMERTIME
WHY HE DIDN'T JUST MADE A PUSH-UP ON BOTH HANDS I GUESS HE CAN FALL DOWN ON 2 HANDS PICK UP THE HAMMER AND THEN PUSH HIMSELF UP TO STANDING POSITION I THINK IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE SINCE LOWER GRAVITY
WHAT ABOUT GRAPPLING THE POLE TO PULL HIMSELF DOWN LOOKS DRIVEN IN ENOUGH TO BE STURDY TO HOLD
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO THINK OF THE APOLLO MISSIONS AGAIN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT SHEILA ASKING TO SEE WHERE THE FLAG WAS PLANTED WHEN VIEWING VIDEO FROM THE MARS ROVER
THIS IS LIKE WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE DIVING IN A POOL TO PICK UP SOMETHING THAT SUNK SO YOU TRY TO BEND DOWN
YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR KUBRICK YELLING CUT BACK YOUR PLACES DAMMIT MAN I'M GONNA GLUE THAT HAMMER TO YOUR HANDS
THERE IS NO GRAVITY ON THE MOON HOW DID THAT HAMMER STOP SO QUICKLY SHOULDN'T THE SAND ALSO FLOAT AROUND AFTER KICKING IT UP JUST WONDERING
HERE IS A VIDEO OF WHEN THIS THING LAUNCHED ONE OF MY FAVORITE LAUNCH VIDEOS EVER OVER HERE WE SCRUB LAUNCHES FOR A LITTLE WIND IN RUSSIA
I DON'T THINK THE USSR RUSSIA GETS ENOUGH CREDIT FOR HOW PERFECT SOYUZ WAS ENGINEERED
HOW DOES SOYUZ HANDLE COLD WEATHER WASN'T THAT A HUGE ISSUE FOR THE SHUTTLE
WOW THOSE BRIGHT PRETTY COLORS POKING THROUGH THE SNOW IS BEAUTIFUL LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A VIDEO GAME
HI GREAT PHOTO I CLEANED IT UP A BIT AND CORRECTED THE WHITE BALANCE TO TAKE OUT THE LOW-PRESSURE SODIUM FROM THE LIGHTS AND TO STRAIGHTEN THE LINES UP A BIT HOPE YOU DON'T MIND

A ATRIA
THIS HONESTLY LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE THE OPENING TO AN AWESOME BOND MOVIE
R EVILBUILDINGS

I KNOW IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY A BUILDING BUT YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN
HONESTLY IF IT WASN'T FOR THE COUPLE STANDING IN THE BOTTOM LEFT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE SCI-FI CONCEPT ARTICLE

A FANTASTIC VIDEO OF SOYUZ A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH FROM VOSTOCHNY COSMODROME SHUTTLE PROBLEM WAS ONE SEAL FOR SOLID BOOSTER WAS LEAKING THE RUBBER WAS FROZEN AND LOOSING FLEXIBILITY SECOND ACCIDENT WAS DUE TO BIG ICE CHUNK FROM TANK FALL OFF AND HITTING WING LEADING EDGE SOYUZ HAS NO SOLID BOOSTER NOR WING IT'S MONOLITH

REMOVE THE PEOPLE AND I ENVISION THIS AS A SCENE FROM ROCKET TOWN IN WITH SNOW
SOYUZ FLIES TO SPACE STATION IN BLIZZARD

MEANWHILE WE HAVE MAJOR PILE UP ON HWY IN 2 OF SNOW
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS THIS LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THAT SCENE IN FF VII
POSSIBLY MY FAVOURITE SPACE RELATED PHOTO I'VE EVER SEEN ON REDDIN
I AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMED THAT WAS TRIMETHOXYAMPHETAMINE THEN I REALIZED IT WAS A ROCKET
GIVEN HOW FAR AWAY VENUS IS FROM THE SUN THIS REALLY GIVES SOME PERSPECTIVE ON HOW HUGE THE SUN ACTUALLY IS VENUS IS THE BODY CLOSEST TO EARTH IN SIZE DATUM SPACE YOU BIG
A MUCH BETTER VERSION INCLUDING SEVERAL OTHER DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OF IMAGING FROM THAT SPACECRAFT TELESCOPE CAN BE FOUND IN THE NASA GODDARD VIDEO OF THE EVENT

TO CLEAR UP SOME CONFUSION I SEE IN THE COMMENTS IMAGES LIKE THIS ARE LOOKING AT EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET EUV EMISSION FROM THE SUN SO WHEN VENUS OR MERCURY TRANSIT THE FACE OF THE SUN THEY BLOCK THAT EMISSION AND SO THEY LOOK BLACK IN SOME PLACES YOU MIGHT SEE IT DESCRIBED AS THE SHADOW OF THE PLANET CROSSING THE SUN BUT THAT'S A MISLEADING DESCRIPTION IT IS THE PLANET ITSELF YOU'RE SEEING

THE SPACECRAFT ITSELF NASA SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY IS IN ORBIT SO TO A GOOD APPROXIMATION YOU CAN SAY THESE IMAGES WERE TAKEN FROM EARTH
OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME IS THIS VIDEO CAPTURED

WOULD IT BE RIGHT TO SAY THAT THIS WOULD BE HALF OF VENUS ORBITAL PERIOD ANY GOOD SOURCES FOR READING UP ABOUT THE TRANSIT
THIS TERRIFIES ME AND TO THINK THE SUN IS SMALL COMPARED TO OTHER STARS
I'M EXCITED BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE ALMOST IN THE VIDEO ERA OF SPACE EXPLORATION

IN THE BEGINNING WE ONLY GOT PICTURES BUT NOW AFTER THE USE OF TIME-LAPSE AND CAPTURING EVENTS AS THEY HAPPEN I CAN FINALLY SEE THOSE STILLS ANIMATED INTO A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND GRASPABLE PERSPECTIVE
I WONDER WHO THE FIRST PERSON IS GOING TO BE TO PULL A SWEET ASS SLAP SHOT ON THAT ICE PATCH MY MONEY IS ON THE CANADIAN DELEGATION
SOURCE MORE
THE ORIGINAL ONE WAS TAKEN BY THE APOLLO CREW ON DEC AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT KILOMETERS MI SECOND ONE WAS TAKEN BY THE DISCOUR SATELLITE ON NOV AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT KM MI
IS THERE A DEFINING DIFFERENCE I SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR THEY LOOK THE SAME TO ME EXCEPT FOR THE TOP ONE'S SUPERIOR LIGHTING
QUITE LITERALLY THE CIRCLE OF LIFE

HOW MUCH AS THE RESOLUTION WENT UP IN THAT TIME AND JUST AS AN ASIDE DO PHOTOGRAPHS HAVE AN ABSOLUTE DISTANCE THAT THEY CAN ZOOM
PHOTOSHOP HORIZON TOO BLUE SUN IS WHITE NOT YELLOW CAN'T SEE STARS DUE TO SUN'S BRIGHTNESS
EARTH FROM PHOTOSHOP YOU CAN TELL BY THE PIXELS

BASICALLY IF YOU CAN SEE THE STARS AND THE SUN AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THE PICTURE HAS BEEN DOCTORED
I LIKE HOW THEY USED A LENSE TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE EARTH ISN'T FLAT












S
WHILE IT MAY NOT BE A REAL PICTURE ITS PRETTY DAMN CLOSE AND LOOKS REALLY GOOD
I DON'T REALLY CARE IF IT'S FAKE OR NOT IT'S ONLY RELEVANT BASED ON THE SUBREDDIT YOU POSTED IT IN A MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR POSTS LIKE THESE IN THE FUTURE IS UNDER R EARTHBORN CHEERS
SILLY THE EARTH IS FLAT ANYONE WITH A WELL NO EDUCATION COULD TELL YOU THAT
COULDN'T YOU GO OUTSIDE AND TAKE A PICTURE OF THE GROUND AND SAY ITS EARTH FROM SPACE AND BE CORRECT

THAT'S CORRECT RIGHT A PICTURE OF EARTH FROM SPACE NOT OUTER OR INNER SPACE BUT SPACE
THIS REMINDS ME OF THE MUSIC VISUALISATION ON THE HOT DANG I WISH THEY'D BRING THAT OVER TO AS A DASHBOARD THEME OR SOMETHING
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA ACCIDENT HAPPENED

I WAS SITTING AT HOME WAITING FOR COVERAGE TO START ON CNN I GOT UP TO MAKE A SNACK SO I COULD SETTLE IN FRONT OF THE TV AND WAIT FOR THEIR ARRIVAL WHEN I HEARD MY DAD SAY OH MY GOD AND CALLED ME BACK TO THE LIVING ROOM I LOOKED AT THE SCREEN AND IT WAS FILLED WITH STREAKS AFTER WATCHING THE REPLAYS A FEW MORE TIMES I WENT TO MY BEDROOM AND WEPT
I WAS CAMPING WITH MY BOY SCOUT TROOP AT SNOW CANYON STATE PARK IN SOUTHERN UTAH THE PREVIOUS DAY WE HAD BEEN WORKING ON OUR KNOT TYING MERIT BADGE WE CREATED A FT TALL TOWER OUT OF WOOD POLES TIED TOGETHER AT THE JOINTS TO DEMONSTRATE OUR KNOWLEDGE AND THE STRENGTH OF KNOTS WE GOT UP EARLY AND ALL CLIMBED ONTO THIS TOWER TO SEE THE SHUTTLE STREAK ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SKY THE SONIC BOOM WAS UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAD EVER HEARD SUCH A SURREAL EXPERIENCE MADE EVEN MORE SO UPON HEARING OF ITS DISINTEGRATION LATER THAT DAY
I WAS IN 2ND GRADE AND MY SCHOOL ARRANGED FOR ALL THE CLASSROOMS TO GATHER IN THE GYMNASIUM WHERE WE ALL SAT IN ROWS ON THE FLOOR TO WATCH THE FIRST TEACHER GO UP IN SPACE ON A BIG PROJECTOR SCREEN

I DON'T REMEMBER MY REACTION WHEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED BUT I REMEMBER CLEARLY FILING INTO THE GYMNASIUM AND THEN AFTERWARDS OUR TEACHER SAYING THAT OUR GUIDANCE COUNSELOR WAS AVAILABLE TO TALK TO ANYONE WHO FELT THEY NEEDED TO I DON'T KNOW IF I WENT INTO SHOCK OR WHAT I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING IN BETWEEN
AND TO THINK THAT IT HAD LESS COMPUTER PROCESSING ABILITY THAN A MODERN SMARTPHONE
WHAT DID LAUREL CLARK SAY TO HER HUSBAND BEFORE SHE LEFT

YOU FEED THE DOGS I'LL FEED THE FISHES


WHAT WERE THE COLOR OR LAUREL EYES

ONE BLEW RIGHT ONE BLEW LEFT
IS THERE ANY REALISTIC WAYS TO TERRACIFORM MARS

HOW TO OVERCOME LACK OF MAGNETIC FIELD
WE ARE ALL GROWN UPS HERE

THE ACTUAL FUTURE OF MARS

IF IT'S TRUE THE PLANETS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THE SUN THIS IMAGE WOULD REPRESENT THE PAST RIGHT
HOW COME MOST TERRAFORMED DEPICTIONS OF MARS ONLY HAVE AN OCEAN IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ISN'T THERE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER AT THE SOUTHERN POLE
MARS IS LIKE BACK UP INCASE ANYTHING REALLY BAD HAPPENS

WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG ON THIS BLISSFUL PLANET TO MAKE US WANT TO LEAVE

RHETORICAL SARCASM BLAST OFF
CORRECTION THAT IS WHAT MARS WILL LOOK LIKE AFTER WE CRASH EUROPA INTO IT
I'VE BEEN PLAYING AN APP CALLED TERRAGENESIS WHERE YOU TERRACIFORM PLANETS LIKE THIS IT'S EARLY DAYS I THINK IT'S JUST ONE GUY WORKING ON IT BUT IT HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TOOK ME A WEEK TO TERRACIFORM THE MOON BUT LOOKED PRETTY COOL AFTERWARDS
NOT SURE IF IT WOULD LOOK THIS WARM THE TEMPERATURE WOULD STILL BE MARS TEMPERATURES AT LEAST TO SOME DEGREE NO PUN INTENDED BUT NOW THAT I SEE IT PUN INTENDED
I DON'T FAULT PEOPLE FOR USING THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO DREAM OF POSSIBILITIES AND SUCH FOR EXTENDING LIFE BEYOND OUR PLANET BUT SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE WE AS HUMANS HAVE OUR PRIORITIES ALL OVER THE PLACE

WE HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD PLANET RIGHT BENEATH OUR FEET THAT WE AND THE REST OF THE LIVING ORGANISMS THAT INHABIT IT HAVE BECOME ADAPTED TO FOR LONG STRETCHES OF TIME THE SUN AND EARTH GIVE
US LITERALLY EVERYTHING WE NEED TO SURVIVE WITHOUT EXPECTING ANYTHING IN RETURN AND WHAT DO WE DO

BURN HARMFUL RELEASING THEM INTO THE ATMOSPHERE RAVAGE THE NATURAL WORLD FOR FINITE RESOURCES DESTROY ECOSYSTEMS THROUGH HUNTING FISHING FARMING DUMP HARMFUL BY PRODUCTS BACK INTO THE ENVIRONMENT AND CONTINUE TO TAKE UP MORE AND MORE OF EVERYTHING WHILE DOING LITTLE TO PROTECT WHAT WE DO HAVE EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT THE NATURAL WORLD

NOT TO MENTION AS A SPECIES WE HAVE YET TO LEARN HOW TO COEXIST WITH EACH OTHER AND THE NATURAL WORLD AROUND US IT'S ALL VERY SAD BUT MAYBE THAT IS THE CENTRAL FALLACY OF MANKIND WE HAVE ALL THE ABILITY AND INSIGHT INTO BECOMING STEWARDS OF A WORLD THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY MANAGE FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF OUR LIVES AND ALL LIVING CREATURES AROUND US YET WE ALLOW GREED AND COMMERCE TO DICTATE HOW WE LIVE

JUST OFFERING MY OWN INSIGHT INTO THESE AREAS
A PERHAPS POSSIBLE FUTURE FOR MARS THIS WOULD ALSO REQUIRE HUMANS NOT TO DESTROY THEMSELVES IN THE NEXT FEW THOUSAND YEARS AN INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY POSSIBILITY
I THINK THAT BY THE TIME WE GET GOOD ENOUGH AT MANIPULATING COMETS AND ASTEROIDS TO TERRACIFORM MARS WE WON'T BE WORRIED ABOUT CATASTROPHIC ASTEROIDS ANYMORE
SO WHICH PLANETS MAKE THE MOST SENSE TO MUSH TOGETHER SO THERE IS ENOUGH MASS THE RESULTING BLOB OF DEBRIS CAN EVENTUALLY BE CALLED A HABITABLE PLANET WITH A MAGNETIC FIELD
IT ALSO HELPS IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE ANY INFORMATION OR SOURCE ABOUT THE PHOTO OTHER THAN AN ASTRONAUT ON THE MOON
IND IT LOOKS FAKE TO ME BECAUSE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY
I FIND THIS MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT STUFF BEING POSTED RIPPED STRAIGHT FROM WEBSITE
AND THEN THE INEVITABLE COMMENTER WHO ALWAYS FINDS A WAY TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT TO SPACXEX
GLAD I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO'S NOTICED THIS PRETTY SURE PEOPLE JUST TREAT THIS SUB AS EASY KARMA
WELL THE SUB ISN'T CALLED R SPACENEWS THIS IS JUST AS GOOD CONTENT I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU HAVE AGAINST STUFF IN A STUFF SUB
AS FAR AS HUMAN BEINGS ARE CONCERNED US GETTING TO THE MOON IS VERY CURRENT

JUST WOW THAT PHOTOGRAPHER IS FAR FAR FROM HOME

IT'S HARD TO COMPREHEND HOW AMAZING THAT MUST HAVE FELT
VALERIA STOP PUTIN ON A SHOW AND CLOSE THE HATCH YOU ARE LETTING AIR CONDITIONING OUT
THIS IS NEAR THE END OF HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE LONGEST EVER HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT
HE SPENT DAYS ON MIR ROUGHLY MONTHS

WIKI
WHAT IS THE DARK GRAY SPIRAL THING IN THE PHOTO JUST BELOW AND TO THE LEFT OF THE COSMONAUT
NEUROSURGERY RESIDENT HERE WE ALREADY HAVE SURGERIES FOR TREATING THE BUILDUP OF CEREBROSPINAL FLUID CSF CAUSED BY OTHER CONDITIONS CLASSICALLY WE USE A VENTRICULOPERITONEAL SHUNT WHICH BASICALLY SHUNTS CSF FROM THE BRAIN TO THE ABDOMEN VIA A TUBE THAT RUNS UNDER THE SKIN IT'S A VERY COMMON PROCEDURE THAT WE DO THAT MAY BE USED TO PREVENT THIS CONDITION IF WE SET A VALVE THAT COULD CONSISTENTLY SHUNT AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF CSF WHILE THE ASTRONAUT IS IN SPACE
THIS ARTICLE MAKES ME KINDA SAD

HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY MUCH SMARTER THAN I CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY AROUND THE VISION LOSS AND BRAIN DAMAGE FROM LONG TERM SPACE FLIGHT
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW DANGEROUS SPACE IS IT WILL TAKE THAN A FEW ROCKETS AND WISHFUL THINKING TO RUELY SURVIVE EVERY CAUTION MUST BE ACCOMMODATED FOR
WE REALLY NEED TO START DEVELOPING SPACE SHUTTLES AND STATIONS MEANT TO ROTATE FOR SIMULATED GRAVITY I AM STILL VERY SURPRISED WE ARE STILL DOING MONTHS OF WEIGHTLESSNESS
YOU COULD MAKE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY THROUGH ROTATING THE SHIP TO CREATE A CENTRIFUGAL FORCE
THE SOURCE ARTICLE MOSCOW TIMES HAS SINCE BEEN CORRECTED

CORRECTION AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS STORY INCORRECTLY REPORTED AS ROSCOSMOS DID THAT IS THE FIRST YEAR RUSSIA FELL BEHIND THE U SOUTH IN LAUNCHES IN FACT THE SOVIET UNION WAS INITIALLY BEHIND THE U SOUTH FROM ABOUT TO AND BRIEFLY AGAIN DURING THE LATE

STILL PRETTY COOL THOUGH
I LIKE THE FACT THAT ORION NEBULA IS CLEAR AS HELL IN THIS PICTURE I'M ALWAYS MORE AMUSED BY THE NEBULA THAN THE ORION ITSELF
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THIS WILL END UP BEING LIKE THE X PRIZES WHERE THE PRIZE RECEIVED IS LARGELY CEREMONIAL COMPARED TO THE MONEY SPENT DEVELOPING SOMETHING

THIS IS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM GETTING SOLID WASTE AWAY FROM SOMEONE'S BODY WITHOUT THE USE OF THEIR OWN HANDS AND IN A ENVIRONMENT INSIDE A SUIT THAT IS SUPER COMPLICATED
WELL FOR EXAMPLE IF WE DECIDED TO COLONIZE MARS THOSE PEOPLE BORN AND LIVING ON THE PLANET MIGHT NOT DO SO WELL ON EARTH THEIR BONES WOULD BE MUCH WEAKER THAN AN EARTHLING ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IS THE CHANGE IN ATMOSPHERE AND GRAVITY
WHAT THE HECK IS RIDGIL SAME THING AS RIGEL

THE GROUP AIMS TO DECIDE WHICH TRADITIONAL STAR NAMES FROM CULTURES AROUND THE WORLD ARE THE OFFICIAL ONES IN ORDER TO AVOID CONFUSION THE IAU SAID IN THE STATEMENT

MISSION NOT ACCOMPLISHED
IN ORDER TO REDUCE CONFUSION WE'VE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING VERY CONFUSING
ME TELLS PEOPLE TO SUCK IT UP AND ACCEPT THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLUTO

ALSO ME YOU BASTARDS IT'LL ALWAYS BE ALPHA CENTAURI TO ME
IF ALPHA CENTURI AND PROXIMA CENTURI ARE A BINARY PAIR HOW IS PROXIMA ALWAYS CLOSER TO EARTH
THE IAU HAS MADE A LIST OF OFFICIAL NAMES FOR SOME STARS BUT THESE STARS STILL HAVE DESIGNATIONS IN OTHER CATALOGS SYSTEMS ALPHA CENTAURI IS STILL ALPHA CENTAURI IF YOU'RE GOING BY BAYER DESIGNATION THE IAU ARTICLE RELEASING THE NEW OFFICIAL NAMES STILL HAS THE BAYER FLAMSTEED DESIGNATIONS AS THE FIRST COLUMNS IN THEIR TABLE YOU CAN CHOSE WHICHEVER SYSTEM TO REFER TO A STAR THAT YOU WANT
THEY AVOIDED CONFUSION IN THE SAME WAY OF THAT OCCASION WHEN THEY DECIDED THAT SOME LARGE ROUND OBJECTS ORBITING THE SUN ARE DEFINITELY NOT PLANETS AND NAMED THEM DWARF PLANETS

I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT THE IAU IS SOME SORT OF TROLL CABAL
DUMBEST THING EVER IT IS ALPHA CENTAURI AND THAT IS WHAT IT'S GONNA BE FOREVER
IN ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT THE INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMICAL UNION HAS BEEN RENAMED TO A BUNCH OF MINDLESS JERKS WHO'LL BE THE FIRST AGAINST THE WALL WHEN THE REVOLUTION COMES
WHY DON'T WE RENAME SAGITTARIUS A THE SUPERMASSIVE BLOCKHOLE IN THE CENTER OF THE MILKY WAY EVERY TIME I SAY THE NAME IN MY HEAD I IMMEDIATELY THINK BUT ITS NOT A STAR HOW ABOUT CHRONOS
YEAH I'M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND KEEP CALLING IT ALPHA CENTAURI
I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS PARTICULAR CHANGE EPSILON ERIDANI IS NOW RAN MUCH LESS OF A MOUTHFUL
PROPORTIONALLY THE OCEANS ARE JUST A VERY THIN FILM OF WATER OCEANS ARE MANY THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS ACROSS BUT ONLY A COUPLE OF KILOMETERS DEEP IMAGINE IT MORE LIKE A LAYER OF PAINT
THIS IS A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF HOW THE VOLUME OF A SPHERE SCALES

IT LOOKS LIKES THE DIAMETER OF THE LARGE SPHERE I'M GUESSING LARGE IS ALL THE SALT WATER AND SMALL IS ALL THE FRESH IS ABOUT HALF THE WIDTH OF THE USA WHICH IS ABOUT ACROSS VOLUME OF A SPHERE WITH DIAMETER KM IS LITERS

WOLFRAM ALPHA LISTS VOLUME OF THE OCEANS AS
THE KEY IS THE COMPARISON TO EARTH RADIUS IS ABOUT MILES THE DEEPEST PARTS OF THE OCEANS ARE ABOUT MILES SO EVEN IF THE ENTIRE EARTH HAD WATER MILES DEEP NOT JUST THE OCEAN PARTS BUT INCLUDING THE CONTINENTS THAT'S STILL SO OF THE RADIUS OF EARTH WOULD BE WATER

VOLUME IS CUBIC SO THAT MAGNIFIES THE DIFFERENCE IN SIZE AS WE CAN SEE
THE PICTURE IS A BIT MISLEADING BUT ACCURATE IT'S HARD TO SHOW EXACTLY HOW BIG THE BALL OF WATER HOW MANY MILES THE CIRCUMFERENCE IS IS IN RELATION TO THE EARTH THE PICTURE ORIGINATES FROM THE WEBSITE WITH OTHER INFORMATION
HERE
I HEARD THE COMPARISON ONE TIME THAT IF THE EARTH WERE THE SIZE OF A GLOBE THE DISTANCE FROM THE TIP OF EVEREST TO THE LOWEST POINT OF THE MARIANAS TRENCH WOULD ONLY BE AS TALL AS PEAKS AND VALLEYS OF YOUR FINGERPRINTS DIDN'T DO ANY MATH TO SEE IF IT WORKED OUT BUT IT AT LEAST PUTS THE GENERAL TOPOGRAPHY OF EARTH AND THUS THE AMOUNT OF WATER ON EARTH INTO A SCALE THAT CAN BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD
ISN'T THERE MORE WATER AT THE BOTTOM ON THE OCEAN PER CUBIC METER THAN AT THE TOP DUE TO THE IMMENSE PRESSURE
I COULD BE PREPARING TO PERSONALLY DEORBIT THE ISS POTENTIALLY IN THE NEXT YEARS
THIS IS MY SHOCKED FACE I'D SAY LET'S FOCUS ON SPACE EXPLORATION BEFORE SPACE COMBAT BUT WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT
JAY WE FOUND WATER ON A PLANET THAT CANNOT CREATE NEW WATER LET'S USE IT UNTIL THERE IS NOTHING LEFT
A POST DETECTION PROTOCOL PDP EXISTS AND IS SOMEWHAT THOROUGH

WIKI PROV FLA
BE AFRAID OF DEAD ALIEN BODIES

2 PUT FACE CLOSE TO ALIEN COBRA THING



RELEASE ALIEN TERROR UPON EXPLORATION PARTY CREMATES
PRETTY SURE THERE IS A BASIC HOW TO GUIDE ON FIRST CONTACT THAT GOT RELEASED

I'M SURE IT'S BEEN UPGRADED SINCE
DO YOU MEAN DISCOVERY OF ANY LIFE AT ALL OR CONTACT WITH SENTIENT LIFE
THERE IS A NASA AND UN PLANETARY PROTECTION PROTOCOL MADE IN IT ISN'T ABOUT THE BREAKING OF NEWS BUT REQUIREMENTS FOR ROVER STERILIZATION AND THE DIRECTIVE THAT ALL EXPLORATION STOPS AS SOON AS ANY LIFE FORM IS FOUND OR DEFINITELY DETECTED

ACCORDING TO A UNITED NATIONS TREATY COUNTRIES SHOULD CONDUCT EXPLORATION OF PLANETS SO AS TO AVOID THEIR HARMFUL CONTAMINATION THAT'S WHY MARS ROVERS INCLUDING CURIOSITY ARE CAREFULLY CLEANED BEFORE BEING LAUNCHED TO AVOID TAKING MICROBES FROM EARTH INTO OUTER SPACE

WE ARE LIVING IN THE AGE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR ANNOUNCEMENTS FINDING ANY KIND OF LIFE NOT FROM EARTH WOULD BE THE BIGGEST ANNOUNCEMENT OF ANNOUNCEMENTS IT PROBABLY DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE DISCOVERY IS OF A MICROBE OR A REPTILIAN MARTIAN HAVING GONE TOTALLY UNDERGROUND FOR MILLION YEARS WALKING UP TO CURIOSITY AND TAKING A SELFIE WITH IT
MICROBIAL VERY SIMPLE LIFEFORMS YEAH PROBABLY GONNA BE MADE PUBLIC

INTELLIGENT LIFE FORMS WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH MOST LIKELY WE WON'T HEAR ABOUT IT
ON TOP OF WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID REMEMBER THE LEAKS OVER THE HIGGS DISCOVERY AT CERN THERE'S NO WAY ANYTHING LIKE THIS WOULD BE KEPT QUIET DUE TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND ANONYMITY NOWADAYS
I'M INCREASINGLY CONVINCED THAT WE'VE MADE CONTACT AND ARE JUST NOT BEING TOLD
MAN I DON'T KNOW THAT I'VE EVER SEEN A PERSPECTIVE LIKE THIS OF MARS MUCH LESS A WHOLE VIDEO THIS IS SUPER RAD
SOURCE

SOME DETAIL

IN THIS REMARKABLE MOVIE THE VISUAL MONITORING CAMERA VMC ON MARS EXPRESS WAS USED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO IMAGE THE LIMB OF MARS DURING MOST OF A COMPLETE ORBIT SHOWING IN GOOD DETAIL THE ATMOSPHERE SEEN ON EDGE AT THE APPARENT BORDER BETWEEN THE PLANET S SURFACE AND SPACE

THE MOVIE WAS STITCHED TOGETHER FROM A SERIES OF STILL IMAGES ACQUIRED BY THE CAMERA DURING GMT ON APRIL DURING ORBIT

THE SPACECRAFT WAS COMMANDED TO TURN AS IT ORBITED MARS WHICH KEPT THE CAMERA POINTING AT THE BRIGHTEST POINT ON THE HORIZON AS MARS EXPRESS PASSED OVER THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE

SHOUT OUT TO ALEJANDRO CARTESIAN AT THE MARS EXPRESS SCIENCE OPERATIONS CENTRE ESAC SPAIN AND SIMON WOOD SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS ENGINEER AT ASOC GERMANY

EDIT THE WHOLE VIDEO IS JUST THE SAME LENGTH AS THE GIF
OK LOOK FOR THE SPACECRAFT LOOK FOR THE SPACECRAFT STILL DON'T SEE IT OH WE ARE ZOOMING IN WAS THAT IT WAS THAT THE SPACECRAFT OH WE ARE THE SPACECRAFT

RIGHT
I ALWAYS GET THROWN OFF ATH DISTANCES IN SPACE EVERY TIME THIS HAD ME THINKING IT'S GONNA CRASH IT'S GONNA CRASH IT'S GONNA CRASH WHEN IN REALITY IT WAS PROBABLY A FEW HUNDRED MILES ABOVE THE SURFACE AT ITS CLOSEST POINT
YOU CAN REALLY MAKE OUT HOW THIN MARS ATMOSPHERE IS IN THIS VIDEO
SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT PHEW


OK WOW OP YOU GOT TO WARN PEOPLE FAMILY THAT SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME AND I COULD NOT LOOK AWAY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN ON THE RIGHT SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE WATER SPOTS APPEARS ON THE LENS AT THE CLOSER POINT OF THE ORBIT WHAT'S THAT ABOUT
ORBITING IS LIKE FALLING BUT ALWAYS MISSING I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE I GOT THAT QUOTE FROM
IT IS AMAZING TO REALIZE THE DEMONSTRATION OF LAW HERE THE CLOSER WE GET THE FASTEST PRETTY COOL
OHHHH THAT WAS SO MUCH COOLER THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE I WAS EXPECTING A LITTLE PROBE LOOKING THING TO ZOOM PAST BUT THE WE ZOOMED PASSED INSTEAD HAH

IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE REAL ESA FOOTAGE WHERE IS THE SURFACE IMPACT
LINKING TO THE GIANT VERSION OF GAYCAT

THE CORRECT LINK IS NOT

IT IS SIMPLY

SIMPLE
I THOUGHT THAT TINY WHITE DOT WAS THE SPACECRAFT REALIZED IT WAS JUST DUST ON MY SCREEN

I KEENLY LOOK FOR TINY DOTS IN SUCH GIBS
I WAS THINKING FOR A MOMENT WHERE'S THE SPACECRAFT THEN I REALIZED THE VIDEO IS FROM THE SPACECRAFT
FROM THE VIDEO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A HUGE RISK OF GETTING AEROBRAKING DOES ANYONE KNOW IF IT DID THAT WOULD COST A LOT OF
LITERALLY ALL I COULD THINK OF WHILE WATCHING THIS WAS DOOM
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY TO THEY UPPER LEFT YOU CAN SEE WHAT MAKES IT FAKE
IF WE TOOK THIS FOOTAGE IN A TIME MACHINE AND SHOWED THE COMIC BOOK READING RADIO LISTENING KIDS OF THE S THIS I THINK THE MIND BLOWING WOULD BE SO SEVERE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO LIVE THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN THOSE GIANT IRON LUNG MACHINES
THEY CALL ORBITING FALLING TOWARD THE GROUND AND MISSING THIS REALLY HELPS VISUALIZE THAT IDEA
OH HEY MARS JUST GONNA GET A CLOSER LOOK AT YA HERE SO I CAN STUDY YOUR SHIT SHIT SHIT TOO CLOSE SORRY
I TURNED MY HEAD TO WATCH THIS UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE I'M USED TO ENJOYING FROM MOVIES GAMES
R GIFSTHATENDTOOSOON BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT'S SO COOL I DIDN'T WANT IT TO STOP
IT'S WEIRD HOW MY BRAIN KNOWS IT'S REAL BUT CAN'T STOP SEEING A COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGE LIKE I HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING MYSELF IT'S REAL OVER AND OVER
IF YOU SQUINT YOUR EYES AND USE SOME IMAGINATION IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE LOOKING THROUGH A STRAW AT SKIN WHO HAS ACNE

FUCK I'M HIGH
THOUGHT THIS WAS R SCIENCE FOR A SECOND SO DISAPPOINTED I THOUGHT WE'D DISCOVERED AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT ORBITING MARS
I TOOK ME AN EMBARRASSING AMOUNT OF TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE SPACECRAFT WAS
AMAZING HOW THE CAMERA GOT ALMOST BLIND BY THE SUN LIGHT WHEN PASSING BY THE POLE
SOMEONE PLEASE CONFIRM OR DENY MY ASSUMPTION

THE ISS IS MAINTAINED IN A NEARLY CIRCULAR ORBIT WITH A MINIMUM MEAN ALTITUDE OF KM MI AND A MAXIMUM OF KM MI

SO WHAT I'M GETTING FROM THIS IS THAT THIS SPACECRAFT IS IN A HIGHLY ELLIPTICAL ORBIT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SLING SHOTTING ITSELF TO TRAVEL ELSEWHERE

THE ISS HAS A MUCH MORE CIRCULAR ORBIT TO MAINTAIN SPEED IT'S ORBIT
JUDGING BY THE ESA IN THE SIDE THIS IS PROBABLY FROM THE ORBITER THAT SENT THE PROBE TO THE PLANET THAT CRASHED IN THE SUMMER LEFT A CRATER
HERE IS THE FULL TRIPS TO THE SPACE
IT DOESN'T MAKE A SINGLE ORBIT IN THE GIF IT'S NOT EVEN HALF AN ORBIT
ASW HUMANS YOU DID THIS FOR ME

I COULD WATCH THIS ALL NIGHT UNTIL I NOD OFFICIAL

IT'S JUST LIKE MY MOBILE FROM WHEN I WAS A YOUNGLET

THANKS
FFS JUST LINK TO THE VIDEO DIRECTLY STOP TURNING EVERYTHING INTO A LOW QUALITY GIF
THAT'S WHAT YOUR IN ANNUAL TRIBUTE TO THE RIGHT STUFF LOOKS LIKE IN THE MIRROR LOL AAAAAND IT'S GONE
THE FACT THAT THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE HAS A RADIUS THAT IS LARGER IN LIGHT-YEARS THAN THE UNIVERSE IS OLD PLUS THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSE IS IN THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM ON THE LARGEST SCALES GIVES IMPETUS TO THE CONCEPT OF COSMIC INFLATION

THIS PROBLEM IS REFERRED TO AS THE HORIZON PROBLEM

LONG STORY SHORT IF YOU LOOKED A DISTANCE EQUAL TO THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE YOU'D SEE A PART OF THE UNIVERSE THAT'S YOUNGER THAN THAT BECAUSE AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT
THEORETICALLY YOU WOULD BE LOOKING INTO THE PAST CLOSE TO BILLION YEARS AGO BUT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO LOOK THAT FAR BACK SINCE SPACE AND TIME DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE BIG BANG

LOOKING INTO DARK REGIONS OF SPACE THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE HAS CAPTURED IMAGES OF GALAXIES BELIEVED TO BE ONLY MILLION YEARS OLD CORRESPONDING TO THE YOUNGEST GALAXIES IN THE UNIVERSE

HUBBLE DEEP FIELD WIKIPEDIA


NOT THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE IT'S EXPANDING OUTWARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE SO IT'S MORE THAN BILLION YEARS ACROSS SIMPLY PUT THE UNIVERSE ISN'T OLD ENOUGH FOR SOME LIGHT TO HAVE TRAVELED TO EARTH YET
YOU WOULD SEE MORE OF THE SAME A FLAT UNIVERSE NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW
THAT IS WHAT IS BEING DONE NOW WITH HUBBLE AND OTHER LARGE TELESCOPES THEY ARE LOOKING OPTICALLY INTO THE PAST ABOUT BILLION YEARS AND THOSE EARLY DIM GALAXIES ARE ABOUT BILLION LIGHT-YEARS IN DISTANCE IT IS A STRAIGHT-LINE APPROXIMATION AND USING LIGHT IN ITS PARTICLE FORM PHOTONS THERE ARE OTHER SATELLITE OBSERVATORIES LIKE WAP THAT ARE MEASURING THE EM WAVES OF OUR PRESENT AND THAT PROVIDES THE DISTANCE TO THE CB IN OUR PRESENT ABOUT BILLION LIGHT-YEARS DISTANCE

THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED SCHEMATIC OF THE 2D UNIVERSE EACH FLAT PLANE A TIME SLICE AT THE TOP IS OUR PRESENT LOOKING AT THE DISTANT GALAXIES TOWARDS THE SINGULARITY IF THE SINGULARITY IS AT T AND Z THEN WE ARE Z BILLION LIGHT-YEARS IN DISTANCE AT T BILLION YEARS

WIKIPEDIA COMMONS B UNIVERSE

NASA HAS A SIMILAR SCHEMATIC BUT IT IS CONSTRUCTED FROM EMPIRICAL DATA AND INSTEAD OF AN INVERTED PYRAMID THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE-TIME IS DEPICTED MORE LIKE A FLUTED CONE COMPRISED OF THE SPACE-TIME GRID WITH 2D TIME SLICES

MEDIA

WHILE WE LIVE IN THE UNIVERSE WE CAN'T FULLY VISUALIZE IT SINCE IT IS AT LEAST AN DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLD AND PROBABLY NEEDS A DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLD WITH RELATIVISTIC EFFECTS TO FULLY DESCRIBE WE CAN VISUALIZE 2D TIME SLICES OF OUR PRESENT ESSENTIALLY A CAPTURE IN TIME THE CB IS COMING IN FROM ALL DIRECTIONS THIS ENDS UP BEING A 3D SPHERE THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE OF STARS GALAXIES DUST AND GAS OF THE PRESENT IS CONTAINED WITHIN THAT SPHERE

INSIGHTS UPLOADS
I WOULD ASSUME YOU'D SEE PAST THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE IF THAT IS POSSIBLE SAY THE UNIVERSE IS X YEARS OLD THEN THE RADIUS WOULD HAVE TO BE LESS THAN ALIGHT YEARS FROM THE CENTRE SINCE THE MATTER CAN'T TRAVEL THE SPEED OF LIGHT SO IF FROM EARTH YOU LOOKED TOWARDS THE CLOSEST EDGE THEN YOU WOULD SEE PAST THE EDGE OF ALL MATTER I THINK

SCIENTISTS OF REDDIN IS THIS CORRECT
IF I'M READING THE QUESTION CORRECTLY THEN AS SOON AS YOU LOOK UP INTO THE SKY YOU'RE ALREADY LOOKING THAT DISTANCE UNFORTUNATELY LIGHT HASN'T TRAVELED FAR ENOUGH HAS ATTENUATED ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
SHOULDN'T THAT BE HYPOTHESIS CHALLENGING VIEW ON THE SPEED OF LIGHT COULD SOON BE TESTED IT GETS TO BE A THEORY IF IT SURVIVES THE TEST AND MANY MORE AND OF THE ORIGINAL TESTS BY OTHER LABS AND THEN PEER REVIEWED RIGHT
I RECEIVED MY BSEE IN THE SOUTH WE WERE TAUGHT THAT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WAS ONLY CONSTANT TO A RELATIVITY LIKE A FRAME IT IS TRUE AND CONSTANT JUST LIKE GRAVITY IS A CONSTANT

IT WAS NEVER PORTRAYED TO BE SIMILAR TO A GEOMETRIC CONSTANT LIKE PI IT WAS ONLY EVER A RELATIVE CONSTANT LIKE GRAVITY

I GUESS THE GUARDIAN ISN'T A REAL SCIENTIFIC SOURCE SO IT WOULD BE EASY TO GET WRONG OR WAS I TAUGHT BASED ON DIFFERENT CONCEPTS
IT IS A WIDELY KNOWN IRREFUTABLE FACT THAT THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS MILES PER HOUR I MEASURED IT LAST THURSDAY AND THE GUY HOLDING THE FLASHLIGHT CAN CONFIRM SCIENCE
PARTICLES MOVING AT INFINITE SPEED YEAH SURE HOW DOES ONE SLOW DOWN FROM INFINITY
FIND AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT ON GITHUB AND GET INVOLVED FOCUS ON PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTIVE BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN MONTHS AND HAS MULTIPLE PEOPLE COMMITTING TO THE REPO

LEARN ABOUT REAL TIME SYSTEMS THERE'S GOING TO BE HUNDREDS OF YOU GRADUATING WITH WEB EXPERIENCE BE THE GUY THAT GETS A CAREER NOT A JOB LEARN HOW TO WRITE AND DOCUMENT WHAT YOU DO LEARN ABOUT DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES LIKE AGILE AND WHY THEY'RE IMPORTANT ACT AS IF YOUR HOBBY WORK IS YOUR MISSION AND DOCUMENT IT STUDY UP ON INFORMATION ASSURANCE CYBESECURITY SO YOU'RE AT LEAST CONVERSANT IN THE TOPIC

ALSO FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT SPACE LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT SLEEP JUST KIDDING
ALL I'VE LEARNED IS TO FAST FORWARD THROUGH THE ACTING PARTS I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS BUT IT'S SO BAD MEANWHILE AT THE SAME TIME SCI IS RUNNING THEIR MARS SPECIAL THAT'S ALSO AN HOUR LONG AND ALL SCIENCE
THIS SHOW HAS BEEN VERY FRUSTRATING EVERY PROBLEM THEY FACE IS THE RESULT OF A DELIBERATE CHOICE TO DO THINGS THE HARD WAY I WON'T REVEAL PLOT POINTS BUT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE SHOW CONSIDER HOW THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT HAD THEY BEEN FOLLOWING THE MARS DIRECT MISSION PLAN INSTEAD

ONE THING I CAN MENTION WITHOUT REVEALING PLOT POINTS IS THAT IN THE SHOW THIS MISSION IS A PRIVATELY FUNDED COMMERCIAL ENDEAVOUR THE INVESTORS ARE TERRIFIED AND DEMAND A WORKING COLONY ON THE VERY FIRST LANDING OR THE PROJECT IS CANCELLED THIS IS CRAZY AND ILLUSTRATES PERFECTLY WHAT NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON HAS BEEN SAYING ABOUT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IN SPACE ONLY AFTER THE GOVERNMENT HAS CARRIED OUT THE INITIAL EXPLORATION WILL PRIVATE INVESTORS BE COMFORTABLE TO OPERATE ON MARS

THE SHOW SEEMS TO DEPICT A PROGRAM OF MARS EXPLORATION AS LED BY ELON MUSK AND SPACE FROM THE HARDWARE DOWN TO FRANCOPHONE COUNTERPART FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED FANS OF MR MUSK SHOULD TAKE NOTICE OF HOW THIS SHOW REVEALS THE SIGNIFICANT FLAWS IN THIS PLAN AND THE ENORMOUS PROBLEMS SPACE WILL FACE IN LEADING THE EFFORT TO PUT HUMANS ON MARS IF THEY TRY DO IT ON THEIR OWN WITH ITS IN ITS CURRENT FORM
GET THE GOOGLE SKY MAP APP FOR YOUR SMART PHONE RUN APP POINT AT SKY
MIGHT HELP YOU OUT I JUST SEARCHED BELT AND THERE ARE A FEW STARS TO THE LEFT AS WELL AS A NEBULA THE SPARKLING OF THE OBJECT IS DUE TO ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES AND VARYING DENSITIES THAT THE LIGHT IS PASSING THROUGH PROBABLY JUST PARTICULAR CONDITIONS THERE THAT MADE IT STAND OUT MORE
SOUNDS LIKE SIRIUS TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SKY CHART IT'S SET FOR SOMEWHERE IN SLOVENIA YOU'LL NEED TO SPECIFY THE TIME OF YOUR OBSERVATION IS IT SIRIUS

I USUALLY FIND ANY TIME SOMEONE ASKS ABOUT A SURPRISINGLY BRIGHT MULTICOLORED TWINKLING STAR NEAR BELT IT'S SIRIUS SIRIUS IS VERY BRIGHT BECAUSE OF THAT AND WITH A TURBULENT ATMOSPHERE IT CAN APPEAR TO TWINKLE QUITE A LOT AND IN MULTIPLE COLORS
AWESOME TECHNOLOGY CRAPPY HEADLINE

THIS STORY ISN'T ABOUT AN IMMINENT IMPACT AS THE CLICKBAIT HEADLINE INSINUATES BUT OUR NEW ABILITY TO DETECT ASTEROIDS A WEEK BEFORE A FLYBY THAT'S THE REAL STUFF THERE
IT SPOTS SIMILAR OBJECTS FREQUENTLY

LOOKS MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN THE ONE THEY REPORTED THERE ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY IT HAS A DIAMETER OF METERS POTENTIALLY LARGE ENOUGH TO WIPE OUT A CITY IT WILL PASS EARTH AT LUNAR DISTANCES ON DECEMBER 8TH

THINGS GET INTERESTING IF THE LD ESTIMATE IS CONSISTENT WITH ZERO AND THE DIAMETER ESTIMATE IS POTENTIALLY LARGER THAN METERS
ITS LIGHT YEARS AWAY WE NEED FASTER THAN LIGHT SPEED SPACE TRAVEL IF WE WANT TO EXPLORE THESE PLACES
THE ARTICLE STATES

AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM OF ASTRONOMERS USING HUBBLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STUDY STELLAR EVOLUTION IN REAL TIME OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS DRAMATIC INCREASES IN THE TEMPERATURE OF THE STAR SAO HAVE BEEN OBSERVED NOW THE STAR IS COOLING AGAIN HAVING BEEN REBORN INTO AN EARLIER PHASE OF STELLAR EVOLUTION THIS MAKES IT THE FIRST REBORN STAR TO HAVE BEEN OBSERVED DURING BOTH THE HEATING AND COOLING STAGES OF REBIRTH
THERE'S THE ALCUBIERRE DRIVE BUT IT'S SUPER THEORETICAL
FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT TRADITIONAL A TO B TRAVEL VIA FUELS AND ROCKETS IS NOT PRACTICAL FOR SIGNIFICANT DISTANCES

FALSE WE HAVE PUT SPACECRAFT NAMELY PIONEER VOYAGER 2 AND NEW HORIZONS ON SLOW INTERSTELLAR TRAJECTORIES USING RELATIVELY SMALL CHEMICAL BOOSTERS AND GRAVITY ASSISTS FOR FASTER TRAJECTORIES ALL WE NEED IS DOUBLE DOWN ADVANCED ION THRUSTERS ARE A WORKABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR SMALL PROBES WHILE BIGGER CRAFT MAY NEED ANTIMATTER NUCLEAR SALTS OR JUST A FEW THOUSAND NUKES ALL OF WHICH STILL QUALIFY AS FUELS AND ROCKETS

SO TODAY ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE STARTED TO GAIN TRACTION I EAST BENDING SPACE TIME WORMHOLES OR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO STAR TREK'S

NONE THE FACT THAT ALCUBIERRE DRIVE TEAM AT EAGLEWORKS HAS BEEN TRYING TO GAIN PUBLICITY BY CLAIMING THAT EMDRIVE WARPS SPACE INSIDE IT RAISES A LOT OF RED FLAGS AND THE EMDRIVE ITSELF ALREADY HAS MORE RED FLAGS THAN A COMMUNIST RALLY

INTERESTING HOW YOU CAN MAKE OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL

LOOKS LIKE PORTUGAL USE DIFFERENT COLOUR LIGHTS MORE ORANGE YELLOW ALSO THE DARK PARTS OF SPAIN SEEM DARKER THAN IN PORTUGAL
I NEVER THOUGHT OF PORTUGAL AS DENSELY POPULATED

AFTER SEEING THIS PICTURE I READ A BIT UP ON PORTUGAL KM 2 THAT'S DENSE
IF YOU CLICK THE PHOTO ON MOBILE AT LEAST STARS POP UP EVERYWHERE ALSO THE BEST PART OF THE PHOTO IS THE ATMOSPHERE LOOKS WEIRD AND AWESOME
I'M SPANISH AND THAT'S VERY SAD ALL THAT LIGHT SHOULD BE POINT DOWN TO THE FLOOR NOT LIGHTING UP THE SKY THAT WAY WE COULD SEE THE MILKY WAY AND STARS FROM A LOT MORE PLACES SLIGHTLY ON CITIES TOO EVEN WITH THE POLLUTION

PS I KNOW THAT YOU COULD STILL SEE THE LIGHT FROM SPACE IF ALL THE LIGHTS POINTED DOWN TO THE FLOOR BUT NOT LIKE THIS ALL THOSE LIGHTS ARE POINTING UP
THIS IS AWESOME SOME MIGHT THINK THIS ISN'T GLAMOROUS BUT THIS IS THE NITTY GRITTY THAT A CIVILIZATION LIKE I DREAM WE WILL BE WOULD DEPEND ON I IMAGINE IT'S SIMILAR TO HOW WE DEPEND ON GARBAGE COMPANIES THE ROADS THAT THE TRUCKS DRIVE ON ETC YOU JUST GOTTA HAVE FREE AND CLEAR ORBITS BEFORE YOU THINK ABOUT REGULAR TRAVEL TO MOON BASES AND MARS COLONIES
THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE THAT SIMULATED GRAVITY WILL BE IMPERATIVE FOR SPACE FLIGHT ROTATING SHIPS DON'T SEEM LIKE THAT DIFFICULT TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT
IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE THE TRUE CAUSE OF VII IT COULD BE GOOD NEWS FOR MARS EXPLORERS I EXPECT IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT THE CONFUSION OF THE CEREBROSPINAL FLUID SYSTEM WOULD BE GREATLY REDUCED IF NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATED BY THE PRESSURE CHANGES GENERATED BY G
THIS IS INCREDIBLY COOL BEAUTIFUL AND QUITE HUMBLING

WHAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE ARE WE LOOKING AT A PORTION OF THE GALAXY FROM A GREAT DISTANCE IS THIS THE VIEW FROM EARTH I'D LOVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE SEEING A BIT BETTER
DO YOU PLAN ON RELEASING THE SOURCE CODE I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY WITH THIS STUFF

GREAT WORK BY THE WAY
VERY INTERESTING AND MESMERIZING THANKS FOR DOING THAT HOW FAST WOULD YOU HAVE TO BE MOVING TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE THESE IN REAL LIFE WOULD THAT BE MOVING MANY TIMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO SHOW THE DIFFERENT RED OR BLUE SHIFTED STARS
THATS GREAT AND ALL BUT BILLION STARS IS LESS THAN OF THE MILKY WAY REALLY SHOWS HOW MASSIVE OUR GALAXY IS EVEN CRAZIER TO THINK THERE ARE TRILLIONS OF GALAXIES
NICE BEEN MEANING TO TRY SOMETHING LIKE THIS MYSELF BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GRAPHICS PROGRAMMING
WHILE I DON'T DOUBT YOU PLOTTED THEM ALL ACCORDING TO THE DATASET I RECKON I COULD GET CLOSE ENOUGH WITH A RANDOMIZER AND A BASIC THICKER IN THE MIDDLE DISTRIBUTION PATTER AND NOBODY WOULD KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
IN FACT DIAMOND IS THE HARDEST SUBSTANCE KNOWN TO MAN THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING WE COULD USE THAT COULD OFFER MORE PROTECTION

YEAH BUT NUMBER DIAMONDS ARE HARD BUT BRITTLE THEY WILL NOT SCRATCH BUT THEY CAN CRACK OR SHATTER EASILY

ACCORDING TO U IN THIS COMMENT AT R ENERGY THE POWER OUTPUT COULD BE AROUND G MILLIWATT PER GRAM WHICH IS TOO LOW FOR ANY AT LEAST FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC USAGE HERE ON EARTH BUT GOOD ENOUGH FOR SPACE PROBES I RECKON
A TEAM OF PHYSICISTS AND CHEMISTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL HAVE GROWN A MAN-MADE DIAMOND THAT WHEN PLACED IN A RADIOACTIVE FIELD IS ABLE TO GENERATE A SMALL ELECTRICAL CURRENT THE DEVELOPMENT COULD SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OF NUCLEAR WASTE CLEAN ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND BATTERY LIFE

I THINK THEIR DEFINITION OF CLEAN IS DIFFERENT TO MINE I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T WANT THIS IN MY NEW PHONE
I THINK THIS CAN BE USED IN GUNS I SAW LASER GUNS POWERED BY NUCLEAR BATTERIES IN FALLOUT
DIAMOND BATTERIES SOUNDS EXPENSIVE WOULD THERE BE ANY ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS TO HOLD THE RADIOACTIVITY MAYBE A SHIELDING SEAL WOULD SUFFICE AND BE MUCH CHEAPER

ANOTHER THOUGHT ONCE THE POWER IS HIGH ENOUGH I'M SURE OIL LOBBYISTS WOULD SHUT IT DOWN
I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE A IS THE DESIGNATION OF THE PRIMARY STAR IN A SYSTEM ALWAYS THE FIRST PLANET WOULD BE A B A COMPANION STAR WOULD BE B ETC
THE ONLY DESIGNATION OF A SHOULD BE THE STAR ITSELF
IT WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN THE SPACE COAST REGION WAS BUCKLED UNDER THE LOSS OF ALMOST JOBS WITH THE RETIREMENT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM

ADDITIONAL DATA OBTAINED WITH OTHER EXOCARPS AGO INSTRUMENTS FRIEND AND IS AT THE ICI RUSSIA
IF I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT REDDITORS IT'S THAT THEY LOOOOOVE HUFFINGTON POST ARTICLES
SO YOU ARE SAYING THAT SINCE PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE ARE GOING TO FORGET THE STORIES WE'VE BEEN TELLING EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS WE SHOULD COME UP WITH CONSTELLATIONS BASED ON THE STORIES THAT THEY'LL BE TELLING IN THE FUTURE
THERE ARE NEARLY STARS VISIBLE TO THE UNAIDED EYE ON A CLEAR MOONLESS NIGHT UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS WITH GOOD VISION THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT KNOWN EXOPLANETS AND MANY MOST OF THOSE ORBIT STARS THAT AREN'T EVEN VISIBLE TO THE UNAIDED EYE
AS LONG AS THE OPTIC NERVE ISN'T DAMAGED I WOULD TAKE THE TRADEOFF BEING FAR SIGHTED AS A RESULT OF BEING IN SPAAAACE

I'M OKAY WITH THIS

BUT THIS IS ASSUMING THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENS TRUTH IS THERE'S ALSO DNA DAMAGE BONE DENSITY LOSS MUSCLE DENSITY LOSS

STILL OKAY WITH IT SPAAAAACE
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS NEGATIVE PRESSURE ABSOLUTE PRESSURE ASW IS ABOUT PSI IT CANNOT EQUAL OR DROP BELOW ZERO NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU SUCK
PRESSURE IS CAUSED BY FLUIDS GASSES EXERTING FORCE ON A CONTAINER WHEN A CONTAINER IS AT EQUAL PRESSURE THE CONTENTS OF THE CONTAINER EXERT FORCE ON THE INSIDES OF THE CONTAINER EQUAL TO THE FORCE EXERTED BY THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT ON THE CONTAINER YOU CAN CREATE A NEGATIVE PRESSURE ON EARTH BY REMOVING GASSES FROM A SEALED CONTAINER IN THIS CASE THE FORCE EXERTED BY AIR MOLECULES IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS HIGHER THAN THE FORCE EXERTED BY ANYTHING LEFT INSIDE THE CONTAINER AT SEA LEVEL AIR EXERTS POUNDS OF FORCE PER SQUARE INCH OF SURFACE AREA SO THE MAXIMUM NEGATIVE PRESSURE YOU CAN EVER ACHIEVE IS PSI

SPACE IS PRETTY EMPTY THERE ISN'T MUCH THERE TO EXERT ANY SORT OF FORCE ON A CONTAINER SO YOU CAN NOT HAVE NEGATIVE PRESSURE OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE
A ACCUM CLEANER WOULD ONLY WORK INSIDE A SPACECRAFT AS YOU SAY IT CAUSES AIR TO FLOW FROM HIGH WELL PRESSURE IN A ROOM CABIN TOWARD THE LOW PRESSURE AREA INSIDE THE NOZZLE PICKING UP AND DRAGGING ALONG DUST ETC ON THE WAY

WITHOUT A MEDIUM ATMOSPHERE AIR THERE'S NO WAY FOR THE DUST TO GET DRAGGED ALONG WITH IT INTO THE CLEANER

IE THERE'S NO WAY TO MAKE A PRESSURE DIFFERENCE IN A VACUUM AND WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE THERE'S NO WAY FOR THINGS TO FLOW FROM HIGH TO LOW

MAYBE A NET CASTING IDEA OR AN UNFURLED THING WOULD WORK TO COLLECT SPACE DUST

ADAMIK MISSIONS THAT TALK ABOUT VACUUMING A SAMPLE OFF AN ASTEROID AND SUCH ARE PLANNING TO BRING THEIR OWN ATMOSPHERE IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE NITROGEN GAS BLOWER SO SHOOT THAT AT THE SURFACE AND IT WILL BLOW DUST INTO ONTO A COLLECTOR NO REAL SUCKING THOUGH
VACUUM IS SIMPLY RELATIVE LACK OF ANY AIR GAS MOLECULES AT STANDARD TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE STP A MOLE OF A GAS OCCUPIES ABOUT CUBIC FEET THAT'S ABOUT TIMES MOLECULES THE PRESSURE IS THE EFFECT OF THOSE FAST MOVING MOLECULES BOUNCING AGAINST THE WALLS OF THE CONTAINER THEY ARE ALSO BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER BUT WE DON'T MEASURE THAT DIRECTLY

SO A VACUUM IS A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF MOLECULES WHICH REDUCES THE NUMBER OF COLLISIONS WITH THE WALL AND THUS THE PRESSURE MEASURED TEMPERATURE IS ALSO INTIMATELY RELATED BUT I'M IGNORING THAT FOR NOW

WHEN NEARLY ALL THE MOLECULES HAVE BEEN REMOVED WE HAVE A HIGH VACUUM AS THE VACUUM GETS HIGHER THE CHANCE OF MOLECULES BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER BEFORE THEY BUMP INTO THE WALL GOES DOWN THIS MEANS EACH MOLECULE MAY TRAVEL FARTHER BETWEEN COLLISIONS THE MEAN FREE PATH GETS LONGER

AT EXTREMELY HIGH VACUUMS THERE MAY BE A COUNTABLE NUMBER OF MOLECULES FLYING AROUND THOUSANDS PER CUBIC FOOT THE MEAN FREE PATH MAY APPROACH THE SIZE OF THE CONTAINER ACHIEVING THIS LEVEL OF VACUUM IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT ON EARTH

BUT THAT IS STILL NOWHERE NEAR THE VACUUM OF OUTER SPACE WHICH CAN RANGE FROM DOZENS OF MOLECULES PER CUBIC FOOT DOWN TO ONE OR TWO PER CUBIC METER NOBODY I KNOW OF HAS ACHIEVED THOSE LEVELS

THE BEST WAY TO SUCK UP DUST IS LIKELY TO BE ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION THIS HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR SUCH THINGS AS MINING MOON DUST IT CAN ALSO BE USED FOR PROCESSING SUCH AS CHROMATOGRAPHY TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT MATERIALS
THATS TOUGH FOR RUSSIA DROPPING DOWN THE RANKS BUT DON'T MOST OF THE US ULA LAUNCHES USE THE RUSSIAN RD IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD ARGUE THAT RUSSIA IS STILL LAUNCHING MORE VEHICLES INTO SPACE THAN ANYONE ELSE I MEAN IF YOU WANTED TO ARGUE THAT IS

I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE CHINESE LONG MARCH IS BASED ON THE RD I KNOW ITS JUST ARGUING SEMANTICS BUT IT IS INTERESTING THAT ALTHOUGH THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY IS SO BAD AND RUSSIA BASHING IS ALL THE RAGE THAT THEIR OLD ROCKER ENGINES ARE STILL VIABLE
NOT CORRECT RUSSIA FELL BEHIND THE USA BETWEEN AND AGAIN BETWEEN THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT RUSSIA HAS FALLEN BEHIND CHINA THE HEADLINE IS SOMEWHAT DISINGENUOUS
THAT SEEMINGLY SIMPLE IMAGE IS BASED ON MORE MATH THAN I WILL EVER DO IN MY LIFETIME
IMAGE SOURCE FROM HERE
HOW DO THEY CHANGE THEIR INCLINATION SO MUCH THAT TAKES A LOT OF DV
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW THESE SORT OF MANEUVERS ARE PLANNED MULTIPLE GRAVITY ASSISTS OVER THE SPAN OF SEVERAL YEARS IS IT OPTIMIZED BY COMPUTER SIMULATION OR MORE OF A MANUAL PROCESS
I WORKED ON THE CASSINI MISSION WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT U OF ARIZONA IT MAKES ME SAD ITS GOING TO CRASH INTO SATURN I WISH THEY WILL LET IT JUST BE
ALL THIS NEEDS IS THE MASS EFFECT CRITICAL FAILURE MUSIC THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DIE
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE TRAJECTORIES I WILL TRAVEL BETWEEN STORES TO GET MY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING DONE
WORD CLOUD OUT OF ALL THE COMMENTS HETP

I HOPE YOU LIKE IT
THANKS TO HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE PHYSICS BEHIND THIS ORBITAL PATTERN
AND WILL THIS EVER HAPPEN IN OUR LIFETIME OR IS THAT ONE OF THOSE IN 2 MILLION YEARS THINGS
I NOTICED THAT THERE ARE PARTICULAR POINTS 2 ONLY WITH BLUES AND WITH BLUE AND YELLOW WHERE A GOOD MAJORITY OF THE ORBITS KEEP INTERSECTING IS THERE SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT WITH THESE POSITIONS
I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE AN ANIMATED VERSION THE ORDER OF EACH ORBIT DRAWN ON
THE CURRENT NAIF SPICE ORBITAL DATA FOR CASSINI IS PUBLIC INFORMATION

FTP PUB NAIF PDS DATA COLP DATA


I CAN MAKE IT SPIN BOTH WAYS WITH MY MIND WHICH WAY IS IT ACTUAL SPINNING
MY PHYSICS TEACHER IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED ON THE CASSINI MISSION
I HOPE THERE'S A TARDIGRADE STILL ON CASSINI THAT SURVIVES AND COLONIZES THE PLANET
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SATELLITE AFTER IT ENTERS THE ATMOSPHERE OF SATURN ASSUMING IT WILL BE CRUSHED WHAT IF THERE WAS A RIDICULOUSLY STRONG SATELLITE THAT CAN GO THROUGH SATURN WILL IT EVER HIT A SURFACE
THIS IMAGE WOULD BE EASY TO TURN INTO A 3D ANIMATED CROSS EYE VIEW I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO ON THIS CRAPPY OL COMPUTER
VIDEOS IN THIS THREAD WATCH PLAYLIST

VIDEO COMMENT

TENSOR CALCULUS WHAT TENSORS ARE FOR 2 IT'S PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL HONESTLY THE EXACT CURVATURES ARE BASED ON LARGER THAN IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY DIFFERENTIAL SURFACES THIS ISN'T YOUR BASIC NEWTONIAN ORBITAL MECHANICS AND EVEN THAT IS FREAKINGCOMPLICATED IF YOU
CASSINI EPIC JOURNEY AT SATURN LIVE PUBLIC TALK 2 THE INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT NETWORK MAPPING CHAOTIC MOTION THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM TITAN THERE WERE SEVERAL SPOTS BETWEEN SATURN AND TITAN THAT THE SATELLITEUSES TO RADICALLY CHANGE DIRECTION WITH ALMOST NO FUEL THEY DID THE SAME WITHJUPITER MISSION I IMAGINE IT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO TARZAN SWINGING FROM TREE BO-TREE COVERING CISTA

HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM PRINCIPIA DOING GRAVITY PROPERLY ACTUALLY PHYSICS WORKS FINE IN ESP THEY ONLY NEEDED TO CHANGE ONEORBIT TO MAKE IT WORK THEY HAD TO MOVE MYLO TO STOP IT EJECTING VALL
HOW EARTH MOVES NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASKED FOR BUT I HOPE THIS HELPS
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH I'LL KEEP THIS UPDATED AS LONG AS I CAN

PLAY ALL INFO GET ME ON CHROME FIREBOX
SO THIS WAS TO GET THE RIGHT TRAJECTORY TO LAND OR VELOCITY AM I CORRECT I KNOW I HEARD SOMETIME BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE REASONING BEHIND IT
I'M NOT SURE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS I'M NOT ENGLISH SO I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE SENTENCE

IS IT THE ORBIT IT WILL MAKE AROUND SATURN BEFORE KILLING ITSELF IN THE ATMOSPHERE
WHY ARE THEY PLUNGING IT INTO SATURN AND I'M ASSUMING DESTROYING IT WOULDN'T IT BE MORE USEFUL TO LAND IT ONTO TITAN OR SOMETHING
THE AMOUNT OF MATH CALCULATED TO MAKE THIS SIMPLE GIF IS MIND BOGGLING
AND THE SATURNIAN ARE NOW DRAWING THE SAME GRAPH WHICH ACCELERATES THEIR EVACUATION PLAN TO MARS

THE RACE IS ON
SCIENCE IS FLIPPING AWESOME AND BY EXTENSION SCIENTISTS ARE FLIPPING AWESOME WE NEED TO GIVE THEM MORE OF OUR ATTENTION AND OUR RESPECT
CAN ANYONE PROVIDE A LINK TO AN IMAGE JUST LIKE THIS EXCEPT IT'S AN IMAGE OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE PLANETS ORBITAL PATH I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT HOW OUR SOLAR MOVES BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND AN IMAGE OR VIDEO SHOWING EXACTLY HOW OUR SOLAR SYSTEM WORKS
WILL WE GET ANY CLOSE UPS POSSIBLE UPPER ATMOSPHERE SHOTS OF SATURN OR WILL CASSINI BE CRUSHED BY THE PRESSURE AND GRAVITY BEFORE WE HAVE A CHANCE

WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO SLINGSHOT IT OUT OF THE SATURN SYSTEM ALL TOGETHER
HOW MANY ACTUAL MANEUVERS COSTING HOW MUCH DV ARE NEEDED OR IS THIS ALL A GIANT SEQUENCE OF GRAVITY ASSISTS WITHOUT ANY COURSE CORRECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY PREPLANNED BEFORE THE MISSION STARTED
OK ASSUMING THAT THIS VISUALISATION IS THE RESULT OF A SIMULATION AND THEREFORE A COMPLEX ITERATIVE PROCESS WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR AT EVERY STEP DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THE MARGIN FOR ERROR IS AT THE END OF THE PATH

CAN WE PREDICT WHICH SIDE OF THE PLANET IT WILL LAND ON OR WHAT STREET
JUST WONDERING BUT WHY SO MANY WEIRD ORBITS AND WHY NO SLOWING DOWN TO THEN PLUNGE DOWN
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO ADJUST THE ORBIT SO CONSTANTLY GRAVITY ASSISTS OR ACTIVE BURNS
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'LL TAKE THAT LONG MAYBE ORBITS OR SO HOW MANY YEARS IS THAT
FOR ANYONE ELSE WONDERING WHERE RINGS ARE YOU CAN SEE THEM BEST WHEN THE TAN OVAL IS POINTING TO THE RIGHT I COULDN'T SEE THEM AT FIRST
THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT MANY MORE ORBITS IS THIS A SIMPLIFIED VERSION IF NOT HOW LONG DOES ONE ORBIT USUALLY TAKE
BOT BEEP BEEP I'M ALL ABOUT TOP POSTS

THIS POST HAD UPVOTES AND GOT POSTED TO TWITTER AND SUBREDDIT R REDDIN

THE TWEET



ALL UPVOTES ARE ON AND R REDDIN

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL POSTS ON AND R REDDIN
SO HOW MUCH BETTER WILL THE IMAGES IT TAKES OF THE RINGS AND ATMOSPHERE BE ON THESE FINAL CLOSE APPROACHES COMPARED TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE ONE OF THESE DEEP SPACE PROBES JETTISON A TINY CLOCK OR GYROSCOPE OR SOMETHING AND RETRIEVE IT N LOOPS LATER ON A AS PART OF A RELATIVITY EXPERIMENT I KNOW THE OBJECT WOULD HAVE TO BE DECELERATED TO BASICALLY STATIONARY AND I KNOW THOSE OVERLAPPING NODES AREN'T SINGLE POINTS BUT ARE PRETTY VAST REGIONS OF SPACE STILL WE REALLY ARE JUST THIS CLOSE TO PULLING OFF THIS SORT OF COSMIC GAME OF AND THAT IS TRULY REMARKABLE
WAIT A MINUTE THIS IS THE ACTUAL CURVE OF CASSINI

X 2 COS SIN 2 X Z X R T H

THE TRAJECTORY IS WRONG ITS GOING TO DESTROY TH EARTH
HOW DO THEY CHANGE FROM AN EQUATORIAL ORBIT TO A POLAR ORBIT WITHOUT USING A OF FUEL
WHY IS THE MISSION BEING TERMINATED

DID IT RUN OUT OF SOMETHING CRITICAL LIKE PROPELLANT
RIDICULOUSLY COOL GRAPHIC I DON'T EVEN CARE WHICH ORBITS THEY ARE AND I VISIT THE NASA WEBSITE ALMOST EVERYDAY
AFTER SEEING THIS I FEEL LIKE WE'RE EARTH DEFINITELY GOING TO CRASH INTO SOMETHING
I'M CURIOUS IF THE IMPACT SUCH AM EVENT WOULD HAVE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM IF ANY
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY CHANGES TO THE ORBIT I KNOW I DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT LANGUAGE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE CASSINI SPEND TIME IN MAJOR PLANES
I THINK IS FROM ARRIVAL THEN 2 DIFFERENT ONES FOR INSTRUMENTATION BUT THEN WHY DO 2 OF THE MAJOR ORBITS EXIST ENTIRELY ON THE DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE AXIS
WASN'T THERE A HUGE FUEL REQUIREMENT FOR ALL THESE ADJUSTMENTS
SO WHY ARE PLUNGING THIS THING INTO SATURN AGAIN WE CAN'T MAKE IT TAKE A FEW PICTURES THEN EXPLORE ANOTHER THING

EDIT GUYS I GET IT I DUMBED OUT THERE I UNDERSTAND MY MISTAKE NOW IS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO CONTINUE DOWNVOTING ME
THESE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS WELL DONE JAMES KEANE


IF YOU ARE MOBILE USER DON'T EVEN BOTHER CLICKING THIS NOTHING BUT POP UPS ADS AND FORCES REDIRECTS TO OTHER AD WEBSITES
SOURCE
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SIMULATING A GRAVITY LIKE FORCE THE PARTICLES DON'T END UP FOLLOWING ELLIPTICAL ORBITS LIKE THEY WOULD UNDER A GRAVITY FIELD
COULD SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY THE PARTICLES BURST OUT WHENEVER THE GRAVITY BECOMES TOO LARGE OR IF IT'S JUST LIKE A SORT OF HARD RESET BUTTON THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED INTO THE WEBSITE
I KNOW IT'S A HOPELESS DREAM BUT I'M REALLY HOPING THAT SPACE EXPLORATION MANAGES TO MAKE SPACE TOURISM TO SATURN A THING BEFORE I DIE THE SIZE OF THOSE RINGS IS UNEXPECTEDLY STAGGERING I WISH I COULD SEE THEM WITH MY OWN EYES
TINY MIMAS HUGE RINGS
GOD IF ONLY HE'D JUST GO THERE SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO SEE HIS FAT ORANGE FACE
IN A SPACESUIT WHO POOPS IN A SPACESUIT EVEN IF AN ASTRONAUT IS DOING A HR SPACEWALK DON'T THINK ITS A PROBLEM UNLESS ITS AN EMERGENCY DIARRHEA
MAYBE A FILTRATION SYSTEM THAT TURNS HUMAN WASTE INTO WATER IT WOULD BE A SIMILAR PROCESS THAT CITES USE FOR SEWAGE WATER TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION JUST ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE
I'M THINKING THEY COULD PUT SOME KIND OF FLUSHING SYSTEM NOT PRACTICAL FOR YOUR EVERYDAY SPACEWALK BUT LIKELY NECESSARY IN THE EVENT OF A EMERGENCY OR EXTREMELY LONG MISSIONS
NASA I'VE GOT THE SOLUTION SEND UP TOILET TRAINED ASTRONAUTS IF THAT'S SUCH A PRESSING ISSUE XD
WHY THOUGH THESE IMAGES ARE ALL PUBLIC DOMAIN I COULD PROBABLY GET THEM PRINTED CHEAPER AT A GENERIC PRINTSHOP WHICH WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF ITS OVERHEAD COSTS BEING SPREAD OVER A LARGER CUSTOMER BASE AND NO SHIPPING COSTS OR USE MY OWN PRINTER INK AND PAPER FOR A PRINTER ARE STILL JUST A COUPLE DOLLARS PER PRINT
GOODLUCK I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO START A BUSINESS IT ISNT EASY HAHA
SWEET VIEW

DOES ANYBODY KNOW THE LENGTH OF TIME THIS GIF COVERS MINUTES ETC
WOW THIS IS GREAT IT LOOKS JUST LIKE IN HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM WHEN I TRY TO DOCK TO MY STATION MINUS THE EXPLOSIONS
THESE GUYS DOCK DOLLAR SPACECRAFTS TRAVELING AT THOUSANDS OF MILES AN HOUR HUNDREDS OF MILES ABOVE THE EARTH AND SOME DAYS I STRUGGLE TO TIE MY SHOES
AM I GETTING THIS RIGHT THE SOYUZ AIMED FOR A HIGHER ORBIT THAN THE ISS BEFORE THIS MANOEUVER SINCE ITS AT GREATER ALTITUDE IT'S ORBITAL VELOCITY IS SMALLER THAN THAT OF THE ISS WHICH IS INTENDED TO SYNC THE SOYUZ WHILE PUTTING IT ALMOST ABOVE THE ISS AT THE MOMENT THIS VIDEO IS SHOT IT'S USING THRUST WITH A LITTLE ORBITAL DECAY TO DOCK CORRECTLY
IT IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO SPLIT WATER INTO HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN IT JUST TAKES ENERGY
I'M NO SCIENTIST BUT LACK OF AN ATMOSPHERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM HERE
TL R FOR EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT LAUNCHING SHIT TO MARS

THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT WHILE WEARING A SPACESUIT ASTRONAUTS ARE LITERALLY WEARING DIAPERS

IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TRAPPING AN ASTRONAUT IN HIS SUIT FOR MORE THAN THE NORMAL SEVERAL HOURS ITS NO LONG TERM SOLUTION
THEY SHOULD JUST USE IT TO CONSTRUCT A GIANT SATELLITE IN ORBIT IT MAY BE USEFUL AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE AND IF NOT THEY CAN ALWAYS RAIN A GIANT DOWN ON ANY COUNTRY AS A SYMBOLIC GESTURE
FOR ANYONE WHO DIDN'T READ THE ARTICLE THE PROBLEM ISN'T WHAT TO DO WITH IT ONBOARD A SPACECRAFT OR STATION IT'S WHAT TO DO WITH IT IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY AND THEY NEED TO EMAIL IN THEIR SUITS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME A MINIMUM OF DAYS
THEY COULD USE IT AS FUEL I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH ENERGY COULD BE USED FROM POOP BUT THEY COULD MAKE A ROBOT POWERED BY THE POOP IT COULD DO SMALL TASKS LIKE CLEANING OR SOMETHING OR BE A USEFUL ROBOT DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH ENERGY CAN BE USED THE COUNTY ROYAL A P CLEANING ROBOT APPARATUS POD
ANY IDEAS THERE IS PRIZE MONEY
FIRE IT IN A COLLISION COURSE WITH MARS I'M SURE IT'LL BE GOOD TO HAVE SOME FERTILIZER THERE
USED TO BE A TRUCKER AN ON SOME OF THEM LONG HAULS YOU GOTTA GO NASA PART OF THE GOVERMENT THEY WONT GET A TICKET IF THEY CHUCK IT OUT THE WINDOW
HOW ABOUT DURING THE EMERGENCY SITUATION NOT EATING SOLID FOOD AND USING A SORT OF NUTRITIOUS LIQUID IV INSTEAD

I RECALL ONE OF MY FRIENDS HAD AN INTESTINAL OPERATION AND HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T USED THE TOILET FOR MANY DAYS WHILE HE WAS FED BY IV LIQUIDS
SHOULD COLLECT LOADS OF IT AND SHOOT IT OFF TO MARS TO FERTILISE THE GROUND
JETTISON IT TOWARDS EARTH TO HELP KEEP ISS IN SPACE OR EXPOSE TO SPACE THEN BRING IT BACK IN FOR FERTILIZER ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK ISS IS DOING ANYTHING BIG WITH GROWING THEIR OWN CROPS
THE FASTEST WOULD BE THROUGH AN INCINERATOR RIGHT THOUGH I'M SURE ASTRONAUTS WON'T LIKE WEARING IN THEIR HINDQUARTERS

MAYBE DEHYDRATE THE STUFF AND GRADUALLY RELEASE THE RESIDUE THROUGH PORES IN THE SUIT
EXTRACT WATER FROM IT AND FILTER THE WATER THEN USE THE DRY SOLID AS FERTILIZER FOR PLANTS BEING CULTIVATED IN SPACE
PUT TUBES INTO EVERY HOLE MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO CONNECT THE TUBES TO THE SHIP OR A CONTAINER WHEN IT NEEDS EMPTYING AND FIND A WAY TO CLOSE THE TUB NEAR THE HOLE SO THEY CAN SUCK IN THERE OUT
ISN'T METHANE A BYE PRODUCT OF THE BREAKDOWN PROCESS METHANE CAN BE USED AS A GREENHOUSE GAS OR EVEN A WARMING ELEMENT NORWAY HEATS SOME OF ITS RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL ZONES THROUGH ITS WASTE TREATMENT CENTERS
WHAAAT REALLY JUST PUT IT ON A BAG AND PUSH IT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE
PEER REVIEW IS A SANITY CHECK A BUNCH OF PEERS OF THE PUBLISHERS REVIEW THE METHODOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND SAY THERE ARE NO OBVIOUS SCHOOLBOY ERRORS HERE YOUR LAYOUT AND MATHEMATICAL ANALYSES AND THE RESULTS YOU HAVE MEASURED SEEM TO AGREE WITH WHAT YOU ARE CLAIMING YOU ARE TESTING IN ADDITION WE CONCUR THAT YOUR LIST OF POTENTIAL ERROR SOURCES IS CORRECT AND CONCUR THAT THEY REQUIRE FURTHER TESTING

PEER REVIEW DOESN'T MEAN SOMETHING WORKS PEER REVIEW MEANS THAT AN INDEPENDENT GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLISHING RESEARCHERS HAVE VIEWED THE DATA AND PAPER AND HAVE NOT SPOTTED ANY MASSIVE RED FLAGS WHICH SHOULD PREVENT PUBLISHING

EMDRIVE AS A DEVICE IS STILL UP IN THE AIR THIS PAPER JUST MEANS THAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK THE REASON IT DOESN'T WORK IS AS YET UNDETERMINED

DISCLAIMER I'M A SOFTWARE DEV WHO DID UNDERGRAD PHYSICS I'M ALSO A HUGE SPACE SCI-FI NUT I WOULD LOVE EMDRIVE TO WORK THE REALIST IN ME HOWEVER HAS TO ACCEPT THAT THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION IS UNACCOUNTED FOR MAGNETIC OR THERMAL EFFECTS


I HAVE DEGREES IN PHYSICS AND AERO ASTRO I'VE ALSO WORKED ON SEVERAL INTERPLANETARY SPACE MISSIONS THE EXPLANATION FOR THE REACTION OF R PHYSICS AND THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY AT LARGE OR THE SMALL SEGMENT THAT EVEN HAS CARED TO FOLLOW THE EM DRIVE IS THE FOLLOWING

EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS REQUIRE EXTRAORDINARY EVIDENCE A RELATIONLESS DRIVE WOULD LIKELY IMPLY NEW PHYSICS EVEN IF THE EXPLANATION IS THE QUANTUM VACUUM CONJECTURE IN THE PAPER THE BAR IS VERY HIGH AND EXTREME SKEPTICISM IS THE CORRECT BAYESIAN PRIOR

2 THE TEAM THAT DID THIS RESEARCH AT EAGLEWORKS HAS UP TO THE PUBLICATION OF THIS PAPER BEEN SECRETIVE AND ELUSIVE GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY NATURE OF THE CLAIMS THIS HAS FURTHER HELPED TO PAINT THE PICTURE THAT HIS WORK DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL TESTAMENT

EXPERIMENTAL ERROR IS EXTREMELY LIKELY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH FORCES THIS SMALL RAZOR IS THAT THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL ERROR THE PROPER WAY TO PRESENT WORK LIKE THIS IS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF HUMILITY AND SEE THE WONDERFUL WAY THE OPERA TEAM HANDLED THE PUBLICATION OF THE FASTER THAN LIGHT NEUTRINO ANOMALY BY CONTRAST THE TEAM HERE HAS NOWHERE NEAR APPROACHED THAT LEVEL OF HUMILITY

GIVEN THE SIMPLICITY OF THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND THE RELATIVE LACK OF PUBLISHED HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE EM DRIVE HETP THERE ISN'T MUCH OF A FOUNDATION OF CREDIBILITY IF SUCH A SIMPLE SETUP TRULY SHOWED NEW PHYSICS IT'S VERY UNLIKELY IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SEEN IN A SIMILAR SETUP PREVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY YOU CANNOT DISCOUNT THAT THESE GUYS ARE BRILLIANT MAVERICKS BUT AGAIN THE ALTERNATIVE IS MORE LIKELY

NONE OF THIS MEANS THAT ANY IDEA SHOULD BE DOWNRIGHT REJECTED HOWEVER THIS MY IMPRESSION OF THE GENERAL HOSTILITY MET BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AS SOMEONE WHO'S DONE BOTH PHYSICS RESEARCH AND WORKED ON LARGE SPACE MISSIONS I PERSONALLY CONSIDER THE EM DRIVE TO BE ALMOST CERTAIN TO BE EXPERIMENTAL ERROR HOWEVER TRUST ME I'D BE NOTHING BUT DELIGHTED IF I WAS WRONG
MY THOUGHTS ARE MERELY TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT HELL BENT ON PROVING THE STUDY IS INCONCLUSIVE AND SHOWS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE IS A PRETTY GOOD WORKING DEFINITION OF SCIENCE
THERE IS NO REAL ARGUMENT AGAINST THE POINT RAISED BY THE FOLKS AT WEEKLY SPACE HANGOUT
WATCH V FEATURE T

THE MARGIN OF ERROR OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENTS FOR EACH POWER SETTING IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE SPREAD BETWEEN THOSE INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENTS SO THE ACTUAL MARGIN OF ERROR IS MUCH LARGER THAN PRESENTED WITH THE INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENTS THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY MEASURING NOISE

JUST BECAUSE IT PASSED DOES NOT MEAN THAT T WORKS IT MEANS THAT THERE ARE NO GLARING PROBLEMS WITH THE EXPERIMENTS

I'M NOT BUYING THE EM DRIVE THE THRUST IS SO SMALL AND SO FAR WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR IT JUST SEEMS RIDICULOUS TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO THE ENGINE
I'M NOT AN EXPERT BUT I HOPE THE EM DRIVE WORKS NOT ONLY WOULD IT BE AN INTERESTING NEW PROPULSION SYSTEM BUT IT WOULD ALSO PROVE WRONG A LOT OF THINGS WE THOUGHT WE KNEW
MY INITIAL THOUGHTS WERE THAT THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY OBVIOUSLY HAS A BONE TO PICK WITH THE EM DRIVE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS HOWEVER THE TOP COMMENT RAISES SEVERAL GOOD POINTS AND HAD ME HALFWAY CONVINCED THAT THE RESULTS COULD ME ANOMALOUS EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THIS IS IN THE AIAA JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND NASA THE AIAA HAVE BEEN AVOIDING THE EM DRIVE LIKE THE PLAGUE NOBODY WANTS A REPEAT OF COLD FUSION

HOWEVER AS I KEPT READING I WOULD SEE COMMENTS SUCH AS IT'S JUST A IRRELEVANT JOURNAL LOOKING TO GET SOME QUICK ATTENTION THIS IS OBVIOUSLY FALSE WHILE I'M SURE THE AIAA JOURNAL DOESN'T HOLD MUCH WATER IN THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY IT IS VERY WELL RESPECTED IN THE AEROSPACE ENGINEERING FIELD

NEEDLESS TO SAY I'M NOT COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT A FEW REDDITORS COULD SINGLE-HANDEDLY DISPROVE WHAT A NASA AIAA COULD NOT I HAVE NEVER TAKEN QUANTUM FIELD THEORY SO I CANNOT COMMENT ON HYPOTHESIS BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HEAR SOME ACTUAL ENGINEERS GIVE SOME INPUT AS TO THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE PUBLICATION IT GOT A BIT TIRING DISCUSSING THE ISSUE WITH ONLY PHYSICISTS THEY SEEM TO HAVE AN INHERENT NEGATIVE BIAS TOWARD THE EM DRIVE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE GIVEN THE LAWS OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS IMPLYING THAT IT IS A PHENOMENON RELATED TO QUANTUM MECHANICS IF THE EM DRIVE IS INDEED PRODUCING THRUST SINCE EAGLEWORKS HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE QUANTUM VACUUM IS APPARENTLY SHADY AT BEST ACCORDING TO ALL THE ARMCHAIR REDDITION PHYSICISTS THEY REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS PUBLICATION

PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT THINK OF THIS
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE PAPER DID NOT DISCUSS PLANS FOR HOPEFULLY INDEPENDENT FOLLOW-ON VALIDATION TESTING NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER HAS AN OUTSTANDING ELECTRIC PROPULSION FACILITY SO DOES THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY JPL BOTH THESE FACILITIES ARE OBVIOUS AND LOGICAL SITES FOR VALIDATION TESTING THE TEST RESULTS DID NOT CONVINCE ME THAT THERE WAS A NET POSITIVE THRUST INDICATING RELATIONLESS PROPULSION BUT MORE COMPELLING IS THAT THE EXPERTS EAST G NASA ARC JPL IN LOW THRUST ELECTRIC PROPULSION DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DON'T SEEM TO BE DEMANDING THE CHANCE TO TEST THE DEVICE SINCE ACTUAL SUCCESS WOULD BRING NOBEL PRIZE LEVEL RECOGNITION THAT SEEMS PRETTY DAMNING TO ME

THE COLD FUSION OF THE CENTURY AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S REALLY NEEDED
HERE IS A GOOD VIDEO ON THE EM DRIVE STUDY

JCAQDA

ONE OF THE MAIN POINTS IN IT IS EVEN IF YOU ASSUME THE STUDY RESULTS ARE TRUE AN EM DRIVE POWERED BY COULD LIFT A WATER DROPLET

A PREDICTION OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IS AT THE END OF THE VIDEO IT HAS TO DO WITH HEATING UP ONE SIDE OF THE CONE CAUSING A DIFFERENT REACTION TO THE ATMOSPHERE AT THAT SIDE CREATING THE THRUST
THANK GOD WE HAVE REDDITORS TO POKE HOLES IN THE SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS PUBLISHED IN PEER REVIEWED JOURNALS BY ACTUAL SCIENTISTS
MY TAKE ON IT IS SIMPLE

BUILD IT

2 LAUNCH IT

SWITCH THE DAMNED THING ON

IF IT ACTUALLY MOVES WHAT IT'S ATTACHED TO THEN IT'S TIME TO START ARGUING OVER WHY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND SHOULDN'T WORK

HILARITY ENSUES
JUST SEND UP A HANDFUL OF GRASS SEED AND WITHIN A WEEK THE ENTIRE MOON WILL BE COVERED IN DANDELIONS
IS IT OR IS NOT ILLEGAL TO GROW MARIJUANA ON THE MOON YOU COULD BE RICHARD
SO WHERE DOES YOUR PLANT GET THE WATER AND OXYGEN FROM AND HOW DO YOU WANT TO PROTECT IT FROM EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND THINGS LIKE SOLAR WINDS
A LITTLE TOO AMBITIOUS I THINK SWAP CONSTRAINTS SEEM WAY TOO SMALL FOR A PRESSURE VESSEL GAS STORAGE AIR LOCK AND OTHER MECHANISMS

ALSO YOUR PROJECT REQUIRES YOU TO BE VERY NEAR THE SURFACE CAN THE LANDER ACCOMMODATE THIS AND WHERE WILL YOU GET LIGHT FOR THE SEEDS
THIS IS AWESOME IF YOU WIN AND SUCCEED IS THERE A FUTURE PLAN TO SEND PLANTS SOMEWHERE ELSE I EAST MARS
SAW MANY VIDEOS IN YOUTUBE RELATED TO DIFFERENT TEAMS WITH THE SAME AIM BUT WHO APPROVES ANY COUNTRY TO PLANT SOMETHING SUCCESS OR FAILURE ON THE MOON IS THERE A LAW
I'LL ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS
FIRST OF ALL WE ARE USING MICRO ELECTRIC VALVES TO PUMP IN AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS OF FERTILIZER AS WELL AS AIR TO THE VESSEL THE LUNAR ROVER WILL PUT OUR DEVICE RIGHT ON TOP OF THE LUNAR SURFACE WE WILL EXCAVATE THE SOIL BY USING AN ARCHIMEDEAN SCREW SYSTEM THE SEEDS WE ARE USING ARE EXTREMELY SMALL ARABIDOPSIS SEEDS THAT NEED ONLY ONE GRAM OF SOIL TO THRIVE HOPE THAT CLARIFIES SOME THINGS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS
DELETED
PERHAPS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW CAN CROSSPOST THIS TO R MEALTIMEVIDEOS
JUST WONDERING IS THERE ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS VIDEO SOMEWHERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT BIG ON THE TOP RIGHT
ON THE SAME PAGE ARE ALIENS DRAINING OUR SOLAR ENERGY I FIND IT HARD TO TAKE NEWS LIKE THIS SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY HAVE LINKS TO ALIEN STORIES
OR IS THIS TO DO WITH PHOTOEVAPOURATION
BOB WALKER A TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER HOWEVER CLAIMED THAT DOUBT OVER THE ROLE OF HUMAN ACTIVITY IN CLIMATE CHANGE IS A VIEW SHARED BY HALF THE CLIMATOLOGISTS IN THE WORLD

THAT IS PATENTLY FALSE A PAPER IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS REVIEWED ABSTRACTS OF SCIENTIFIC PAPERS MATCHING GLOBAL WARMING OR GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE THEY FOUND WHICH DISCUSSED THE CAUSE OF RECENT GLOBAL WARMING AND OF THESE ENDORSED THE CONSENSUS POSITION THAT HUMANS ARE CAUSING GLOBAL WARMING

THIS IS JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF HOW DONALD TRUMP AND HIS MINIONS PERPETUATE THE BIG LIE THEORY OF JOSEPH GOEBBELS IF YOU TELL A LIE BIG ENOUGH AND KEEP REPEATING IT PEOPLE WILL EVENTUALLY COME TO BELIEVE IT
WE TALK ANY CHECKS ANY BALANCES BUT THERE'S NOTHING BALANCED ABOUT ALLOWING POLITICIANS TO CONTROL THE ONE ASPECT OF SOCIETY THAT CAN EXPOSE LIES AND RESULTING DISASTERS IT'S HAPPENING IN CLIMATE SCIENCE BUT WHERE ELSE ENERGY ECONOMICS HUMAN RIGHTS

IF THEY CONTROL THE COLLECTION AND FLOW OF KNOWLEDGE HOW DO YOU EXPECT ANY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE FROM THIS EMBARRASSING STATE OF AFFAIRS DOES IT OCCUR TO YOU WHAT WE MIGHT ACHIEVE IF WE ORGANIZED TO SUPPORT THE FREEDOM OF KNOWLEDGE IF ONLY TO GAUGE THE POTENTIAL OF OUR INNOVATION

THIS IS SCARY AS HELL AND EVESHAM SCARIER IS THE COMPLACENCY SO I'LL PLUG THE ADORNERS SUBREDDIT R ADORNERS IN FANCIFUL HOPE THAT WE'LL BEGIN TO HAVE SOME COHERENT REACTION TO THIS MAJOR UNIVERSAL PROBLEM
THE DEPLORABLE ARE IN FULL SWING ON THIS THREAD IT'S AMAZING HOW EASILY THEY GET TRIGGERED
THE GLORY DAYS OF THE DARK AGES ARE BACK WHAT A GREAT TIME TO BE ALIVE
I DON'T SEE THIS HAPPENING THERE ARE TOO MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MONEY SURROUND CLIMATE CHANGE
NO IT WON'T AND NASA WON'T LET IT GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT EVIDENCE DOESN'T JUST DIE IT'LL TAKE CONSIDERABLE EFFORT TO ELIMINATE MINIMIZE THE RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER ISSUES TO ADDRESS

BESIDES THIS IS REMINISCENT OF MORE FAKE NEWS
THANK GOD PUT MORE MONEY IN ACTUALLY BUILDING NEW SPACE SHIPS TO MOVE PEOPLE THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE THE PLANET IS TO LEAVE IT CLIMATE CHANGE SOLVED
TRUMPKINS ARE TOO BUSY SUCKING ON DADDY COCK TO CARE

BOW DOWN BEFORE THE ONE YOU SERVE YOU'RE GOING TO GET WHAT YOU DESERVE NINE INCH NAILS
FUCKING GOOD THERE ARE COUNTLESS PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN EVERY DEVELOPED NATION ON EARTH STUDYING CLIMATE CHANGE NASA SENT MEN TO THE MOON ONCE THEY HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN TO WASTE MONEY DOING SOMETHING EVERYONE ELSE IS ALREADY DOING
POLITICS AND SCIENCE SHOULD NEVER MIX WE DON'T NEED TO KEEP SPENDING BILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS RESEARCHING THINGS WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT AND ARE POWERLESS TO REVERSE


MOTHER NATURE ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE HER WAYS NO MATTER HOW GREEN AND CLEAN WE MAKE THE EARTH OR HOW MANY TRILLIONS WE SPEND REEDUCATING THE PEOPLE
THIS IS REALLY NICE THANKS FOR SHARING IT OP

DOES SOMEONE KNOW FROM HOW FAR AWAY THAT SPACE ITS COULD BE HEARD

WOULD THAT BE A MASSIVE DISTANCE OR JUST LIKE I KNOW IS ALSO FAR BUT IN MY SMALL COUNTRY WE HEARD AN SONIC BOOM IN 2 PROVINCES FROM OUR JETS WHEN JETS FROM A CERTAIN COUNTRY ENTERED OUR AIRSPACE AGAIN

NO ONE REALLY HAS HEARD SOMETHING THAT LOUD BEFORE SO WE WERE ALL THINKING THAT IT WAS THE HUGE EARTHQUAKE OR SOMETHING BECAUSE OF GAS EXTRACTION BUT LIKE I SAID IT WERE JUST TWO S

WE ALSO HEARD THE NEW S FLYING OVER THAT WAS ALSO PRETTY LOUD FOR JUST 2 BEAUTIFUL ENGINEERED JETS JUST CRUISING

SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH IT IS NOT MY NATIVE LANGUAGE
NOTE THAT ANERGIA WAS WITHOUT BURAN WITH BURAN IT WAS AROUND CIRC
THE FALCON NEEDS A BIT OF AN UPDATE ON THERE WAS INDEED RATED FOR ABOUT BUT THE NEW FT VERSION IS GOOD FOR NEARLY
THIS IS A VERY SIMILAR ART STYLE TO SKRABEK

LISTING REF RELATED
THE ANERGIA THAT BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BASTARD MATCHING THE BLOCK AT HALF THE SIZE

SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT THE RUSSIANS THEY KNEW HOW TO BUILD ROCKETS
GOOD GOD THE ITS REALLY IS IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN BUT ITS EXCITING TO SEE THE GENERAL TREND OF LAUNCH VEHICLE PERFORMANCE THOUGH I WISH THERE WERE MORE CHINESE ROCKETS IN THERE FOR COMPARISON SAKE THE LONG MARCH HAS SOME IMPRESSIVE STATS AND THE LONG MARCH ONCE IT FLIES WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH SLS HEAD ON
NICE IMAGE COMPARISON EXCEPT FOR THE ITS BAR TAKING UP HALF THE HORIZONTAL SPACE OF THE ENTIRE IMAGE
UPDATED VERSION


TONS

FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TONS TO LOW EARTH ORBIT

I AM IN AWE THAT'S GODDAMN INCREDIBLE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE SPACE INDUSTRY
THERE ARE MANY MANY THINGS WRONG WITH THAT GRAPHIC IF YOU DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT ROCKETS PLEASE DON'T DO INFOGRAPHICS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL END UP SHARING AND LEARNING WRONG FIGURES

THE DELTA HEAVY CARRIES TIMES LESS THAN THE SATURN YET IT'S LATER IN PRODUCTION AND NOT YET RETIRED I HAVE MANY QUESTIONS DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE I GO
SOURCE
BY FAST THEY MEAN GIGABIT BANDWIDTH THE SIGNALS WOULD TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT JUST LIKE RADIO
THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO BUT IT IS HIGHLY ENHANCED AND INTERPOLATED THE AUDIO IS COMPLETE FICTION

RAW VIDEO OF THE LANDING
THIS WAS THE LIVE COVERAGE OF THE EVENT
IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE THE ARTICLE WAS FILLED WITH FACTS TO THE SUPPORT THE BOLD STATEMENT OF THE TITLE TO BAD WE DON'T LIVE IN THAT UNIVERSE
LIKE READING OLD ISSUES OF OMNI WHILE HAVING A STROKE
DOES THAT MEAN IN ONE OF THOSE PARALLEL UNIVERSES THERE ARE NO PARALLEL UNIVERSES
MISLEADING HEADLINE TO BE FAIR IT'S THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE THAT IS BULLSHIT THE BEST SPIN I COULD PUT ON IT IS A COUPLE OF GUYS HAVE REDISCOVERED PHASE SPACE
STUDY THAT THE ARTICLE MENTIONS FULL TEXT
KNEW FROM THE START THIS WAS CLICKBAIT WE CANT PROVE SUCH A THING
THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO CALL FLUFFY PHILOSOPHY NO EVIDENCE TO CONFIRM AND EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE THEN WHAT THE HELL WOULD IT MATTER
THAT'S WHERE THE REAL WENT OUR UNIVERSE GOT THE SHITTY BAD DECISION
ABOUT TIME I'VE BEEN READY FOR THIS SINCE LORNE GREENE FIRST ORDERED THE VIPERS TO LAUNCH

NEBULA BLISS WAS CREATE TO SEE THE BEAUTY OF THE MOST WELL-KNOWN NEBULA UP CLOSE AND IN 3D EACH NEBULA IS A PROCEDURAL GENERATED USING COMPLEX 3D MATH WHICH MEANS THE MODELS ARE GENERATED IN YOUR DEVICE THEY HAVE BEEN PAINSTAKINGLY RETOUCHED WITH COLOR AND MATHEMATICAL ANOMALIES THE MODELS TRY TO BE AS ACCURATE TO NASA HUBBLE IMAGES WHERE POSSIBLE BUT SOME NEBULAE HAVE MORE COMPLEX INNER STRUCTURES THAT ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD
ONE BY ONE THE OBSTACLES ARE TACKLED
I HOPE TO SEE HUMANS THRIVING IN SPACE RELATIVELY SOON
BESIDES THE POINT THAT THERE IS NO DARK SIDE OF THE MOON ONE OF THESE PICTURES IS AN EARTH RISE THIS SITE SUCKS OP
I'VE LONG THOUGHT THAT SAWYER WAS PROBABLY A CRACKPOT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE EM DRIVE CAN'T TURN OUT TO ACTUALLY WORK IT JUST MEANS HIS EXPLANATION IS LIKELY HOOEY AND HE GOT LUCKY STUMBLING ACROSS ITS DESIGN
BETTER TO BUILD ONE OF THESE

THE GUY WHO MAKES THESE VIDEOS THUNDER IS ABSOLUTELY INSUFFERABLE HE HAS NO FORMAL BACKGROUND IN AEROSPACE AND ENJOYS BEING SNOTTY AND LOOKING DOWN AT PEOPLE
ALL THESE NAYSAYERS TODAY THEY REMIND ME OF MY GRANDMOTHER WHO DIESES EVERYTHING I ALWAYS IMAGINE A SCENARIO IN ANCIENT TIMES WHEN THE TRIBAL PEOPLES WERE OUT PICKING BERRIES AND ONE OF THEM DECIDED INSTEAD TO WORK ON A BOX AND WHEEL DEVICE ALL THE OTHERS WOULD BE LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER AND SCOFF ABOUT WASTING TIME NOT ACTUALLY PICKING BERRIES IF THEY HAD THEIR WAY THE WHEELBARROW WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN INVENTED ACTUALLY THAT'S PROBABLY WHY IT TOOK SO DAMN LONG TO INVENT THE WHEELBARROW


I LIKE THIS ARTICLE BECAUSE IT MENTIONS THE INVOLVED SCIENTISTS WHERE THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND LINKS RELEVANT PAPERS ARTICLES JOURNALS
REALLY INTERESTING THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF WAS THE FAST AND THE SLOW FROM A FIRE UPON THE DEEP

FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK THEY GET AROUND WARP DRIVES AND SPEED OF LIGHT BY SAYING THERE IS A SECTION OF THE GALAXY WHERE THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS JUST DIFFERENT WE LIVE IN THE SLOW WHERE IF YOU CROSS THE BOUNDARY YOU CAN BECOME TRAPPED
IT COULD ALSO BE THAT THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE HAS A HAND IN THE FLUCTUATIONS IN LIGHT SPEED
WE'LL ALL STILL CALL IT ALPHA CENTAURI WE ALREADY KNOW IT BY THAT NAME SEEMS A BIT RIDICULOUS TO RENAME IT IMHO
JUST TO BE CLEAR IT ISN'T BEING RE NAMED RIDGIL CENTAURUS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE OLDEST MOST COMMON NAMES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STAR IT PROBABLY IS THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR THE STAR'S OFFICIAL NAME IT HAS JUST NOT BEEN AS POPULAR AS ALPHA CENTAURI IN RECENT YEARS FOR SAKE OF COMPARISON THE STAR'S NAME IS LISTED AS RIGEL CENTAURUS ON THE STAR'S SIMBA PAGE SIMBA BEING BASICALLY THE CATALOGUE FOR ASTRONOMERS EVEN THOUGH IT LABELS IT AS ALF CEN AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT CHOOSING BETWEEN THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT COMMON HISTORICAL IDENTIFIERS ON THE SIMBA PAGE ALONE THE STAR HAS UNIQUE NAMES OR CATALOGUE NUMBERS

IT LOOKS LIKE THE IAU IS JUST PUTTING IT'S FOOT DOWN ABOUT WHAT OFFICIAL IT WANTS TO KEEP IN IT'S OFFICIAL DATABASE FOR FUTURE WORK I CAN SEE THE UTILITY THOUGH IT'S NOT REALLY ANY BIG DEAL AT THE END OF THE DAY NOBODY IS GOING TO STOP USING THE MYRIAD OF COMMON ALTERNATE NAMES IT DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE THE IAU IS ARGUING THAT THEY SHOULD THE QUESTIONABLE PART OF THIS IS WHY THEY'RE BEING STRANGELY INCONSISTENT WITH IT ALPHA CENTAURI IS IGNORED BUT PROXIMA CENTAURI ISN'T BUT HEY THAT'S THE IAU FOR YOU

A SILLY PERSONAL ANECDOTE WE RUN OUTREACH NIGHTS WITH SCHOOL KIDS AT THE OBSERVATORY WHERE I WORK AND NONE OF US CAN EVER REMEMBER HOW TO GET OUR MEADE TELESCOPE TO TO ALPHA CENTAURI A NICE DOUBLE STAR FOR KIDS BECAUSE IT'S STORED AS RIDGIL KENT IN THE SOFTWARE AND NONE OF US CAN EVER REMEMBER IT LUCKILY IT'S SUPER EASY TO MANUALLY SLEW TO
SO ALPHA CENTAURI IS NOW RIDGIL CENTAURUS BUT PROXIMA CENTAURI IS STILL THE SAME

WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT MADE MORE SENSE TO MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT TRIPLE STAR SYSTEM NAME RATHER THAN TO SPLIT IT UP

I'M NOT SURE WHERE BUT I GAVE SEEN THE NAME RIDGIL CENTAURUS BEFORE ALSO THE ADJECTIVE ALPHA MEANS THAT IT'S THE BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE CONSTELLATION WHICH WILL REMAIN TRUE
THE MATH AND TECHNOLOGY THAT GO INTO MAKING THIS WORK BLOWS MY FUCKING MIND
I NEED TO SHOW THIS TO MY HERBALS THEY STILL MAKE A HUGE MESS OF DOCKING OPERATIONS
I JUST GOT DONE REWATCHING INTERSTELLAR MINUTES AGO AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS EXPECTING
I SPED UP THIS VIDEO TO MAKE IT LESS THAN SECONDS

HERE ARE THREE VIDEOS BY THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY DETAILING HOW THE SOYUZ CAPSULE WORKS FROM LAUNCH TO DOCKING TO LANDING

PART ONE IS ON THE SOYUZ LAUNCH SEQUENCE MIN

PART TWO IS ON THE SOYUZ DOCKING SEQUENCE MIN

PART THREE IS ON SOYUZ UNDOCKING REENTRY AND LANDING MIN
ANY IDEA WHAT THE SPINNING THING ON THE RIGHT IS THAT STOPS SPINNING HALFWAY THROUGH
NEAT SOMEONE SHOULD ADD THIS SOUNDTRACK
IT HAS ALWAYS AMAZED ME HOW WE NOT ONLY MANAGED TO SEND SOMETHING INTO ORBIT BUT WE ALSO MANAGED TO LAUNCH SOMETHING ELSE AND GET THAT TO THE EXACT SAME SPOT AND AT THE EXACT SAME SPEED TO THEN HAVE THAT ATTACH TO THE FIRST THING PERFECTLY
I HAVEN'T SEEN DOCKING THIS SEXY SINCE I RENTED JUNCTION FROM FAMILY VIDEO IN
I KNOW THAT WAS SPED UP BUT I STILL GOT ANXIETY WHEN THEY GOT CLOSE TO THE DOOR YOU ARE GOING TO FAST
THAT'S A SMOOTHER CONNECTION THAN MY CHARGING CABLE GOING INTO MY PHONE
WAS THIS AUTOMATED OR WAS THERE A GUY WITH HIS THUMB ON A JOYSTICK AND HIS BROW FURROWED IN CONCENTRATION
NO ONE SHOW THIS TO THE WE DON'T NEED A MASSIVE ANEURISM ON OUR HANDS
SURPRISING HOW SIMILAR IT LOOKS TO HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE THAT GAME
MY BUDDIES DAD IS ONE OF THE GUYS IN THE CONTROL ROOM IN DULLES FOR THIS I GOT TO GO IN A WEEK AGO AND SEE THEIR FEED OF THE ISS IT WAS PRETTY AMAZING
HOW FAST ARE THEY TRAVELING RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER OR MAYBE RELATIVE TO EARTH WHATEVER WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO COMPREHEND
MUCH IMPROVED IF VIEWED WHILE LISTENING TO NO TIME FOR CAUTION R INTERSTELLAR COMMENTS
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW THE ISS ACCOUNTS FOR ANY MOMENTUM EXCHANGED FROM THE CAPSULE DOES IT HAVE ITS OWN THRUSTERS OR DOES THE CAPSULE ADJUST FOR IT
HOW IS THIS DONE REMOTELY OR IS IT ALL PROGRAMMED AND
MY BRAIN ADDED THE CAPTURE SOUND FROM THE MOVIE APOLLO
I NEED TO HEAR THE DOCKING SONG FORM INTERSTELLAR PLAYING WHILE WATCHING THIS
SO HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE IN REAL TIME LOOKS LIKE WITH HOW FAST THE EARTH IS ROTATING IT TOOK HOURS TO EVEN GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO DOCK
VERY COOL I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CAPSULE DOCKING FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE I USUALLY WATCH THE PROCEDURES ON NASA TV
HOW DOES THE ISS KEEP THE SAME ORIENTATION AS IT ORBITS THE EARTH IT'S ALWAYS CUPOLA DOWN BUT HOW DO THEY KEEP IT THAT WAY

JUST WATCHED THE MARTIAN LAST NIGHT MAN I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE ANXIOUS FROM WATCHING A MOVIE
THIS IS AS IT IS EXPECTED TO BE WHEN WE LIVE IN SPACE LIKE IN THE MOVIES I KEEP REPEATING IT OVER AND OVER IT'S SO AWESOME LIKE DRONE WARS AND DRONE RACING
THAT SPINNY THING IS LIKE MY DOG WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THAT UH WHATS THAT YEEEEEEE
IT'S CRAZY THAT SUCH A LITTLE PROPELLER WOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT UP THERE WHEN THERE'S NO AIR
NOTHING LIKE RUSSIAN DASHCAM VIDEOS WAS WAITING FOR A BUNCH OF GUYS TO GET OUT AND START BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF EACH OTHER THEN REALIZED IT WAS SPED UP
HERE'S A GLORIOUS SOURCE VIDEO


IF ESP TOUGHT ME ANYTHING THEN IT'S THAT THIS MANEUVER REQUIRES MUCH MUCH MORE THOUGHT PLANNING AND PRECISION THAN YOU'D EXPECT FROM TWO THINGS CONNECTING
MEANWHILE BACK HERE ON EARTH

UNGAG
I KNOW THE VIDEO IS SPED UP BUT WHAT CAUSES THEM TO DRIFT WOBBLE FROM EACH OTHER AT THE END THERE IS THERE SPACE WIND GUSTS OR SOMETHING CAUSING THEM TO MINUTELY DRIFT FROM EACH OTHER
HOW TO THE PLANNING AND FORWARD THINKING THAT HAS TO GO INTO THIS IS AMAZING PLUS THE STUNNING VIEW
UP TAKES YOU BACK
BACK TAKES YOU DOWN
DOWN TAKES YOU FORWARD
FORWARD TAKES YOU UP
IT'S MUCH LIKE SHOWING THE FIRST NEANDERTHALS FIRE IT'S AMAZING WHEN ONE SEES FOR THE FIRST TIME BUT THE FIRST HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT WAS IN IT'S NOT A SINGLE FEAT BUT A CULMINATION OF OVER A HALF CENTURY OF HUMAN ADVANCEMENT IT'S AMAZING WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH WHEN WE AREN'T TRYING TO KILL EACH OTHER
JUST AN AMAZING REMINDER OF WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF ONCE WE STOP KILLING AND ARGUING ABOUT EVERYTHING
THIS VIDEO CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THAT GRAVITY IS ABOUT FALLING IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO GET THE FLOATING IN SPACE IDEA OUT OF MY HEAD THE ISS IS JUST FALLING AROUND THE EARTH AMAZING
I FEEL UNEASY LOOKING AT THIS SPED UP FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO CRASH
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

NO IT'S NECESSARY

DUN DUN DUN DUM DIM DUM DIM DUM DUM DUM DIM DUM
IT'S COOL HOW WHEN IT GETS REALLY CLOSE YOU CAN TELL HOW DARK SPACE REALLY IS
SO WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT ROTATING DEVICE THAT GETS RETRACTED AT THE END OF THE VIDEO JUST PRIOR TO DOCKING IS IT SOMETHING THATS STABILIZING THROUGH GYROSCOPIC MOVEMENT APOLOGIES IF THIS IS A STUPID QUESTION
WAS THIS DOCKING PLANNED TO BE DURING A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THE EARTH BLOCKS THE SUN JUST IMAGINED HOW TOUGH IT WOULD BE TO GET IDEAL VISUALS FROM YOUR EQUIPMENT DURING DIRECT SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE
IS THERE A VIDEO OF WHAT ITS LIKE INSIDE THE ISS DURING A DOCKING IM CURIOUS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
SO WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND THEY MISS THE DOCKING WOULD THEY HAVE A SECOND CHANCE WOULD THE CAPSULE FALL BACK TO EARTH
THAT'S VERY COOL BUT I WANT TO SEE THE VERY BEGINNING TO THE END LIKE THAT MOVIE LORD OF WAR WHERE THE BULLET IS BEING MADE AND THAN USED THAT'S WHAT I'D LOVE TO SEE BUT WITH ROCKETS
WHATS INSANE IS THE LENGTH OF TRAVEL IT TOOK AROUND THE WORLD UNTIL IT DOCKED
NOMINALLY THE SOLAR ARRAYS ROTATE IN A PADDLE WHEEL MOTION TO TRACK THE SUN IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS LIKE THIS DOCKING THEY'RE LOCKED IN PLACE TO MITIGATE STRUCTURAL LOADING CONCERNS
HAHA I WATCHED THE WHOLE MINS OF THIS FROM THE ORIGINAL VIDEO
ALL I HEARD WAS THE INTERSTELLAR SCORE DURING THE DOCKING SCENE INSANE
SEEMS RECKLESSLY FAST THEY SHOULD SLOW THE FUCK DOWN DON'T WANT TO LOSE JEB
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SMART ENOUGH TO DESIGN A WAY TO MAKE TWO GIANT METAL CONSTRUCTIONS FLYING AROUND IN SPACE CONNECT YET I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE CORRECT TRAJECTORY NEEDED TO THROW A CRUMPLED UP PAPER BALL INTO MY TRASH CAN THAT'S LIKE FEET AWAY
THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ORBITAL MECHANICS PROBLEM HOPEFULLY I DON'T FAIL MY VECTOR DYNAMICS CLASS SO I CAN TAKE ORBITAL MECHANICS
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COMM THE STATION BEFORE DOCKING SO YOU CAN SEE THE GREEN LINE AMATEURS
I WANT SOMEONE TO PUT A FACE ON IT AND POST IT TO R REALLIFEDOODLES
NO NO THIS HAD TO BE DONE
SORRY FOR THE HIJACK
GIF ANG V S
HOW PEOPLE CAN BELIEVE THAT THESE KINDA THINGS ARE FAKE IS BEYOND ME
THIS IS ABSOLUTE PROOF THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT LOL BUT SERIOUSLY THIS IS AWESOME AND ALSO WE NEED A FONT FOR SARCASM
I PARTICULARLY LIKED THE SOYUZ REDOCKING FROM SUMMER THAT LOOKED LIKE A TIE FIGHTER
ANYONE HUMAN GIVEN THE KNOWLEDGE CAN BUILD A ROCKET PUT IT INTO SPACE AND MANEUVER IT AROUND SO FAR AS EVEN MINING AND SMELTING THE ALUMINUM AND OTHER METALS AND CREATING THE ATMOSPHERIC AND OIL DISTILLATION MACHINERY TO MAKE LIQUID OXYGEN AND LIQUID FUEL THEMSELVES IT'S ALL VERY BASIC CONCEPTS BROUGHT TOGETHER FOR SOMETHING UNIQUE YOU COULD GROW SOME CORN IN A FIELD AND A EXTRACT FUEL THAT COULD GET YOU INTO SPACE

A SINGLE PERSON DOING IT WOULD TAKE A LIFETIME OF WORK WHEN YOU STICK PEOPLE TOGETHER THEY CAN AND DO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER IT ALL IN ABOUT A MONTH GIVEN THE KNOWLEDGE FROM RESEARCH THE RESEARCH IS THE HARD BIT BUT WE ALL STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS

I DO BELIEVE THAT IF TECHNOLOGY WOULD ADVANCE SUFFICIENTLY ANY PERSON COULD ONE DAY FLY AN AIRCRAFT OR SPACECRAFT JUST AS EASILY AS WE DRIVE GROUND VEHICLES I'M SENDING THIS MESSAGE AS A PASSENGER IN A GROUND VEHICLE CRUISING AT SPEEDS THAT USED TO BE UNHEARD OF IN HUMAN CIVILIZATION I AM CERTAIN THAT I COULD MANUALLY DOCK A SPACECRAFT WITH VERY MINOR COMPUTER INPUT IF I HAD A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE VEHICLE SYSTEMS AND MAYBE A PAD OF PAPER

I BELIEVE THAT SPACE TRAVEL WILL EVENTUALLY BE AS COMMON AS AIR TRAVEL AND THAT AIR TRAVEL WILL BE AS COMMON AS GROUND TRAVEL LOOK AT QUADCOPTER RIGHT NOW THAT TECHNOLOGY IS AMAZING AND IS BEING SCALED UP AS WE SPEAK

I THINK THE BIGGEST HURDLE WILL BE GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE AS OKAY WITH AIR AND SPACE VEHICLE DEATHS AS WE ARE WITH GROUND VEHICLE DEATHS WHEN YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING A TECHNOLOGY YOU ARE BOUND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FATALITIES RESULTING FROM IT
THIS LOOKS LIKE A SCENE FROM A SCI-FI MOVIE I'M NOT GONNA LIE THINGS LIKE THIS ARE OF THE REASON WHY I STUDY ENGINEERING
IT STILL AMUSES ME THAT PEOPLE STILL THINK THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT I MEAN JUST LOOK AT THOSE CURVES
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF IT WAS REALLY MOVING THAT FAST OR IS THE VIDEO SPEED UP
THE FLAT WILL SAY THIS IS NASA CGI DUCKERY AND IT'S ALL FAKE SO IS THE ISS SPACESTATION
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE IN THIS SOMETIMES SEEMINGLY DIMLY LIT WORLD I SEE SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME GRIN INSIDE AND THINK YOU KNOW FOR APES WE'RE NOT BAD
THE GUYS WHO DID THE MATH TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN MUST LOOK AT FLAT CAROTHERS WITH DISGUST
THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO THINK THAT EARTH IS FLAT
OR WHATEVER YOU CALL THOSE NUTJOB CONSPIRACISTS SHOULD BE MADE TO WATCH THIS GIF SURE THEY'LL FIND SOME WAY TO CALL IT FAKE THOUGH

THE MATH AND TECHNOLOGY THAT GO INTO MAKING THIS WORK BLOWS MY FUCKING MIND
ITS JUST LIKE WHEN MY ROBOMB DOCKS ON THE CHARGER ROBOMB INVENTED THIS TECHNOLOGY
I ADDED THE DOCKING MUSIC FROM INTERSTELLAR JUST TO MAKE IT DIFFERENT HAVE FUN
LISTENING TO DURAN RIO COINCIDENTALLY WHILE WATCHING THIS IT MAKES THE PERFECT SOUNDTRACK TO THIS GIF

ELITE DANGEROUS BLUE DANUBE WALTZ ELITE BLUE DANUBE DOCKING SEQUENCE
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH I'LL KEEP THIS UPDATED AS LONG AS I CAN

PLAY ALL INFO GET ME ON CHROME FIREBOX
HAVING PLAYED ESP THIS GAVE ME SO MUCH ANXIETY I TOOK AN HOUR JUST TO RECOVER A LAUNCHER FOR FATALITIES THAT RAN OUT OF FUEL FUCK
THIS MAY BE A DUMB QUESTION BUT CAN THE ISS SPIN TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY LIKE THEY DO IN THE MOVIE ARMAGEDDON
I CAN'T GET A SENSE OF SCALE HERE HOW BIG ARE THESE THINGS IS THAT WEIRD SHAPED THING THE ISS HOW LARGE IS THAT BOTH THE THING I'M LOOKING AT AND THE ISS IF THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE
SO WHEN THESE TWO THINGS FIRST GET INTO SYNCHRONIZED ORBIT WITH ONE ANOTHER IS THE CAPSULE MOVING FAR FASTER THAN THE ISS WHILE IT GRADUALLY SLOWS DOWN IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THAT SYNCHRONIZATION
I'M SHOOTING A TIME LAPSE RIGHT NOW AND IT IS STUPID AND SUCKS COMPARED TO THIS
SEEING IT LIKE THIS KIND OF MAKES ME THINK THAT THE OCEAN AND SPACE AREN'T SO DIFFERENT JUST THAT VAST BLACK SEA
THE GIF WAS SPED UP MAKING IT SEEM AS IF THE STATION AND THE CAPSULE ARE BOTH MOVING ACROSS THE EARTH AT EXTREME SPEEDS THE ORIGINAL VIDEO IS A MORE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE TIME FRAME STILL FAST RELATIVE TO US OF COURSE
I REALIZE THIS VIDEO IS SPED UP BUT I REALLY EXPECTED THE CAPSULE TO APPEAR TO SLOW DOWN AS IT NEARED THE ISS
I NEED TO SHOW THIS TO MY HERBALS THEY STILL MAKE A HUGE MESS OF DOCKING OPERATIONS
I CAN'T EVEN SURVIVE A MINUTE IN A HELICOPTER WITHOUT CRASHING HYSTERICALLY
I KNOW IT'S OBVIOUSLY SPED UP BUT THAT FINAL DOCKING APPROACH LOOKED ROUGH VERY HERBAL I CALL THE TECHNIQUE KINETIC DOCKING ALIGNMENT MYSELF WHICH IS A HIGHLY TECHNICAL WAY OF RAM IT HARD ENOUGH TO SWING MY SHIP IN TO POSITION AND LOCK ON
THAT IS SO AMAZING DOESN'T GET ANYMORE REAL THEN THAT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM A MOVIE
THE DOCKING BIT FELT SOMEWHAT UNFLATTERING I MEAN THE WHOLE THING IS STILL FANTASTIC BUT THAT LAST THUMP DOCKING FELT A BIT AMATEURISH

RUNS
I MISSED THE EARTH IN THE BACKGROUND THE FIRST TIME WATCHING THEN PROCEEDED TO WATCH ANOTHER FIVE TIMES JUST TO LOOK AT EARTH
IS THAT A METEOROID OR SPACE JUNK THAT ZOOMS PAST ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH
IT'S RIGHT AFTER ONE OF THE FLASHES
HZFK
I THINK IT GOES GOOD WITH THIS AUDIO
ALL I SEE IS ME TRYING TO DOCK ON ESP WITHOUT ADDING RCS THRUSTERS
GIJ T

IN CASE YOU NEEDED A SOUNDTRACK
OUT OF CURIOSITY HOW FAST WAS THIS VIDEO SPED UP JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE TIME LAPSE AWESOME VIDEO
INTERSTELLAR DOCKING THEME WAS PLAYING IN MY HEAD AS SOON AS THE VIDEO STARTED
DELETED
I WONDER HOW FAST THIS HAPPENED THE CONNECTION LOOKS LIKE IT HITS HARD
HOW SPED UP IS THIS WHAT'S THE ACTUAL SPEED THE ISS IS ORBITING TOO
MAKES ME THINK OF THAT EXTREMELY INTENSE DOCKING SCENE FROM INTERSTELLAR AMAZING
OH BOY AM I DRUNK AND THIS MADE BE DIZZY AS HELL BBB GOING TO THROW UP
OK THIS MAY BE A STUPID QUESTION BUT HOW MUCH TIME DID THIS MANOEUVRE ACTUALLY TAKE
THEY DON'T RETRACT THE SOLAR PANELS 1ST HAVE THEY LEARNED NOTHING FROM ESP

S
IT REALLY BLOWS ME AWAY SOMETIMES THAT SPACE IS ALL RELATIVE THIS GIF REALLY REMINDED ME OF THAT
SOMEONE PUT THIS TO THE INTERSTELLAR DOCKING SCENE MUSIC BY HANS ZIMMER PLEASE
SOMETIMES I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THIS IS REAL AND WE'RE ALL IN THE MATRIX
THAT'S FREAKING NUTS IT'S SO PRECISE WHILE IT'S FLYING INSANELY FAST AROUND THE EARTH IT'S ALSO ROTATING IN 3D AND THEN ORIENTING MOTIONS DAMN
WHO ELSE HAD THE MUSIC FROM INTERSTELLAR S DOCKING SCENE PLAYING IN THEIR HEAD AS THEY WATCH THIS
DAMN THAT WAS EXCITING HAPPINESS RESTORED TO MANAGEABLE LEVELS
ALL I COULD THINK OF WHEN WATCHING THIS ANALYSE THE ENDURANCES SPIN
THIS MINUTE ZERO GRAVITY SPACE DOCKING IS REALLY SOMETHING TO WATCH AND LEARN FOR PEOPLE WHO USE MINUTES TO PARALLEL PARK
WHAT SPEED ARE THEY GOING I THOUGH IT WOULD BE A LOT SLOWER AND SMOOTHER
IT HAD TO BE DONE
DON'T BOTHER TRYING TO GET TO MUN OR DUNA OR SOMETHING CRAZY FIRST OFFICIAL I'M A FEW DOZEN HOURS IN AND HAVE A BUNCH OF JUNK IN ORBIT AROUND KERBING EVENTUALLY I'LL DO ANOTHER RENDEZVOUS WITH MUN AND HAVE A SATELLITE THERE TOO
SORRY IF THIS SOUNDS STUPID BUT WHY WOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DOCK IN THE DARK THAN WHERE IT IS BRIGHT

AND I THOUGH SPACE HAS NO AIR I'M ALWAYS AMAZED HOW PRECISELY THEY CONTROL DIRECTION AND SPEED WITH THRUSTERS WHERE THERE IS NO AIR
SO LIKE WHAT'S IT TAKE TO GET ONTO THE ISS NOW ADAYS ALSO WHAT ARE THEY EVEN DOING UP THERE ANYMORE HAVEN'T THEY RUN OUT OF EXPERIMENTS TO DO YET
WHAT IS THE LITTLE DOODAD SPINNING AROUND IN THE UPPER RIGHT THAT STOPS SPINNING AS IT GETS CLOSER IS THAT SOME TYPE OF RADAR THAT ONLY WORKS AT SOME MINIMUM DISTANCE
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
NO IT'S NECESSARY
WATCH V
HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE IN REAL TIME OR IN OTHER WORDS WHAT KIND OF SPEED WOULD IT BE GOING WHEN IT DOCKS
I SHOW THIS TO THE NEXT JERK THAT CAN'T GET THEIR CAR IN-BETWEEN THE LINES AT A STORE PARKING LOT SAY REALLY AND WALK AWAY
ANYONE GOT A RELATIVELY SHORT ELI HOW THIS WORKS IT LOOKS REALLY WEIRD HOW THEY STOP SO SUDDENLY RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER WHILST ROTATING INTO POSITION ACROSS THE DIFFERENT PLANES
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO BE STRAPPED TO A MASSIVE ROCKET AND BLOWN INTO SPACE IS INSANE MUCH RESPECT FOR ANYONE WHO DOES THIS I'M SCARED OF GETTING ON AN AIRPLANE
THEY MADE THAT LOOK A LOT EASIER THAN I THOUGHT IT WORK OUT TO BE
HOW DOES COLD WELDING NOT OCCUR DURING THIS PROCESS CLEARLY THE SCIENTISTS BEHIND THIS ARE SMART ENOUGH TO GET THIS TO WORK AND WOULDN'T GO TO ALL THIS EFFORT TO FLAKE AND ALLOW COLD WELDING TO OCCUR MY INITIAL THOUGHT IS THAT IT'S TWO DIFFERENT METALS BUT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING ELSE IS THERE A PARTICULAR RULE DURING THE BUILD PROCESS THAT ALL COMPANIES GO BY THAT MALE FEMALE PARTS HAVE A PARTICULAR METAL THAT MUST BE USED DOES ANYONE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS
IT MAKES ME SAD THE TOP COMMENT IS FROM IM TOO STUPID

FOR ONCE ID LIKE TO SEE THE THIS IS WHAT I WAS BORN AS A HUMAN TO DO COMMENT
HANS ZIMMER IS HAVING AN ORCHESTRA PLAYING NO TIME FOR CAUTION ON MY HEAD AS I WATCH THIS
I CAN RECOMMEND TO DO A MISSION IN ORBITER THEY HAVE A NICE HOW-TO PDF WHICH REALLY TEACHES YOU SOME ORBITAL MECHANICS AND DOCKING PROCEDURE STUFF
THE MATH AND TECHNOLOGY THAT GO INTO MAKING THIS WORK BLOWS MY FUCKING MIND
YOU GUYS UP THERE AND DOWN HERE FOR THAT MATTER YOU ARE AMAZING SERIOUSLY WHO NEEDS MAGIC WHEN THIS SHIT IS REAL
NOT A SCIENTIST HOW COME THAT INITIAL IMPACT DOESN'T KNOCK ISS OFF COURSE
THAT'S A SIMILAR PATTERN I APPROACH A GIRL WITH AT A BAR AND THE SAME ROBOTIC DRUNKEN BEHAVIOR
I KNOW ITS SPED UP BUT MY BUTT STILL CLENCHED AT THAT APPROACH SPEED
ITS LIKE ME WHEN I TRY TO DOCK MY SHIP IN ELITE DANGEROUS EXPECT THIS IS MUCH PRECISE VERY MUCH PRECISE
THE AUTOMATED DOCKING PROCEDURE FROM THE OLD ELITE AMBRITE

WATCH V
JUST FOR THE RECORD ARE THE ISS AND THE SOYUZ CAPSULE NOT MOVING AND IT'S JUST THE EARTH ROTATING
ELITE BLUE DANUBE DOCKING SEQUENCE
ASTRONAUTS COSMONAUTS ARE JUST SO OUT OF THIS WORLD IMPRESSIVE THEY'RE THE BEST OF US WELL OUTSIDE OF LISA NOWAK BUT SHE IS SMART AS HELL SO THERE'S THAT
GOD WE ARE TRULY BORN IN THE WORST GENERATION IN THE COMING CENTURIES WE WILL ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH THIS AMAZING FEAT WE ALL JUST SAW WILL BE AS THE SLING TO THE GUN WE CAN ALL CONCEPTUALIZE JUST HOW FASCINATING THE FUTURE WILL BE AN UNIVERSE LEFT UNEXPLORED BUT WE WILL DIE WITH JUST THAT AN IMAGINATION
OK SO NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THAT PARTICULARLY EXTREME SEX ACT IS CALLED
WHY DOES IT DOCK FROM ABOVE WOULDN'T IT TAKE LESS ENERGY TO DOCK DIRECTLY FROM BELOW
AFTER READING MANY OF THESE COMMENTS I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE HERE CGI IS WHAT NASA USES WITH ALL OF THEIR PICTURES TAKE SOME TIME AND FIGURE OUT THAT NOBODY HAS EVER BEEN INTO CONTINUE ON TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOBODY HAS BEEN ON THE MOON UNDERSTANDING SIMPLY BECAUSE ALL THE FACTS ARE OUT THERE
SILLY FACEBOOK STATUS PICKUP LINES FUNNY PUNS HILARIOUS JOKES DIRTY JOKES DOWNLOAD NOW AND RATE US
THIS REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF THAT SCENE IN INTERSTELLAR THAT I STARTED HUMMING THE HANS ZIMMER MUSIC OUT LOUD IN THE LIBRARY WITHOUT REALIZING LOL
FAKE
DON'T NOTICE THE EARTH IS ROUND IN THIS GIF CAN'T BE REAL
WHAT NASA DOMINANCE AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO REMEMBERS THAT OUR SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM IS OVER
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A STAR MUCH LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER PLANETS YOU CAN SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE REMEMBER THOUGH IT'S DEPENDENT ON THE CONDITIONS OF LIGHT POLLUTION INTERFERENCE ANGLE WITH THE SUN ETC
COULD YOU SEE IT UNAIDED ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD IT LOOK LIKE ANYTHING SPECIAL PROBABLY NOT JUST ANOTHER POINT OF LIGHT IN THE SKY UNLESS YOU HAD A TELESCOPE TO DISCERN THE PLANETARY DISK FROM HERE EVEN JUPITER JUST LOOKS LIKE A VERY BRIGHT STAR WITHOUT A SCOPE
HERE
ELON MUSK PLEASE GET ME A SEAT ON YOUR MARS SHIP I WANT TO GET OFF THIS PLANET
OH NOT THE FIGURE DIDN'T THIS TURN OUT TO ME AN

WIKIPEDIA SAYS YES

IT ALSO HAS THE LARGEST KNOWN CLIFF IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM VERONA DRUPES WHICH HAS A HEIGHT OF OVER KM MI

IN THAT CASE IT'S PROBABLY TIED WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF TALLEST CLIFF CANDIDATES FROM AROUND THE SOLAR SYSTEM LAVA FLOWS AT THE BASE OF OLYMPUS MONS ARE HIGH THE DEEPEST CANYON IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM ARGO CHASMA MOON CHARON PROBABLY HAS CLIFFS EXCEEDING BUT IT WAS IMAGED IN VERY POOR DETAIL THERE'S A HIGH CLIFF IN THE HIMALAYAS


FORGET JUMPING OFFICIAL LET'S FINANCE A TRIP TO CLIMB IT I'LL VOLUNTEER TO PICK UP THE LEAD ANY CAPABLE INTERPLANETARY BELAYER HERE
NO ONE IS FIGHTING OVER ANYTHING HUMANS CANNOT GET THEMSELVES BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT LET ALONE BACK TO THE MOON NOR MARS FOR THAT FACT

ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT BUDGET FOR NASA COVERS A TON OF EARTH SPECIFIC BASED SCIENCE AND HAS NOTHING RELATED TO ACTUALLY GOING OUT INTO SPACE
I SAY BRING IT IT'LL INSPIRE COMPETITION AND DESPITE THAT ALL SPACE EXPLORATION EFFORTS ARE A HUMAN ONE I'M A PROUD AMERICAN BUT SPACE EXPLORATION GOES BEYOND NATIONAL PRIDE IT'S ABOUT THE HUMAN SPIRIT NO MATTER WHO'S DOING IT THEY REPRESENT US ALL
THIS IS ACTUALLY AWESOME TO SEE THE MORE FUNDING AND COMPETITION THE BETTER
COMPETITION GOT US TO THE MOON HOPEFULLY THIS WILL SPARK A RACE TO MARS AND BEYOND
OUR LOCAL CUB SCOUT ROCKETRY GROUP IS A THREAT TO DOMINANCE IN SPACE AND THE NEXT TO YEARS IS GOING TO BE MUCH MUCH WORSE
ANY RESEMBLANCE OF NASA S DOMINANCE IS ONLY BECAUSE OF COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND RUSSIA PUSHING INTO SPACE IF THOSE COUNTRIES DIDNT NASA WOULD HAVE BEEN GUTTED

NASA STILL FIGHTS THE PERCEPTION OF PUBLIC WORTH WHAT IS NASA WORTH TO THE AVERAGE JOE WHEN THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE OR ENEMY POLITICIANS ARE HARD PRESS TO PUSH HUGE SCIENCE CONTRACTS

NASA WONT BE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHAT IT USE TO BE UNLESS NASA BECOMES PART OF THE DEFENSE SOLUTION OF THE US MEANING THEY GET FUNDED BECAUSE IT'S DEEMED CRITICAL FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE US IN WHICH CASE THEY WILL HAVE A BLANK CHECK AND THEIR OBJECTIVE IS TO BEAT THE ENEMY

UNTIL THEN THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD NOT CARE NOR WOULD THEY BE ANY WISER

WHAT WILL HAPPENED IS CHINA WILL SUDDENLY HAVE AN EDGE LIKE SPUTNIK IN WHICH CASE THE US WILL SUDDENLY CARE AND PUSH HARD THEY WILL BE EDGED OUT AGAIN AND AGAIN BY CHINA UNTIL IT'S A RACE TO SEE WHO CAN OUT SPEND AND OUT SCIENCE EACH OTHER THE US HAS WON ON TWO OCCASION ALREADY JUST BY OUT SPENDING WILL THEY REPEAT A 3RD TIME SOUNDS LIKE A FAMILIAR STORY TIME TO HIT THOSE HISTORY BOOKS
WE ARE 2 YEARS AWAY FROM THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST MOON LANDING A HALF CENTURY SINCE WE HAD THE CAPABILITY TO GO TO THE MOON LAND DRIVE AROUND ON AN ELECTRIC CAR AND RETURN

IT IS LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKELY THE US AND EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS HAVE NO SPACE PROGRAM AT ALL IN ANOTHER YEARS THE SPEED OF TERMINATING THE APOLLO PROGRAM IS PRECEDENCE FOR WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE COMING YEARS FOR THE WESTERN NATIONS MUSK WON'T BE ABLE TO SAVE THE DAY BECAUSE HE IS DEPENDING ON US GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO KEEP GOING

YOU SEE IT IN THE NEWS EVERY DAY THE US SPACE PROGRAM KEEPS GOING FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT WITH MISSIONS FOR THE NEXT HALF CENTURY THAT DON'T INVOLVE MANNED SPACE TRAVEL WE ARE BEING TOLD THERE IS NO RETURN TO THE MOON PLANNED BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN THERE THERE IS NOTHING TO LEARN OR THE MOON IS TOO HARSH WITH TOO MANY PROBLEMS THAT MARS WON'T HAVE MEANWHILE MARS KEEPS GETTING PUSHED FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT IN TIME

THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR SEVERAL YEARS THEY WILL CONCENTRATE ON A SPACE STATION AND GOING TO THE MOON GOING TO THE MOON ISN'T TO PLAY GOLF IT IS TO PUT TELESCOPES ON PROSPECT FOR RESOURCES AND INVESTIGATE EXTENDED VISITS THE GOVERNMENT SPACE AGENCY IS STARTING TO PLAN FOR SPACE TOURISM WITH THEIR HAINAN LAUNCH COMPLEX THE US IS LEAVING THAT TO COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE EUROPE DOESN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT SPACE TOURISM

THIS RECENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN RUSSIA CHINA JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA TO CO-OPERATE TOGETHER TO DEVELOP AN ASIAN CONTINENT POWER NETWORK MIGHT BE A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME IF THE CHINESE RUSSIAN AND JAPANESE SPACE AGENCIES START WORKING TOGETHER THE US SPACE PROGRAM IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AN OLD MAN ON HIS ROCKING CHAIR ON THE FRONT PORCH
WHILE I WISH CHINA THE BEST ITS INCREASING INDEBTEDNESS AND RISING LOANS ARE LIKELY GOING TO PINCH THE NATIONAL BUDGET LONG BEFORE REACHING PARITY WITH THE U SOUTH
IF SPACE PROGRAM REACHES PARITY WITH THE US THE WORLD WILL BE A SAFER PLACE THE WAY THINGS ARE AT THE MOMENT ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN EAST AND WEST WILL PUT AN END TO SPACE EXPLORATION SEVERAL MORE ANTI SATELLITE MISSILES FROM CHINA AND LEO AND GEO ARE LOST TO US SPACE IS ONE OUR LARGEST ADVANTAGES AGAINST THEM AND THEY WILL TRY AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD UNLESS THEY ARE ARE JUST AS DEPENDENT ON IT AS WE ARE
SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD JUST START PUTTING STUFF UP THERE MOON LAGRANGE POINTS MAYBE SOME ASTEROID MINING

MEANWHILE IN THE U SOUTH THE GOVERNMENT IS INFILTRATED WITH MORONS SOME OF WHOM ARE CERTAIN THEIR GOD IS TELLING THEM THE EARTH IS FLAT

ARTICLE AUTHOR IS UNEDUCATED ON TECH CLAIMS THAT INTERNET AND SYSTEM TIME STAMPS ARE TRUTH IS THAT THE INTERNET IS BUILT ON A BACKBONE OF LAND CABLES AND THAT THE SAME TIME DATA BEING PUMPED UP TO GPS IS OBTAINABLE FROM THE SAME SOURCE OVER THE SAME CABLES AS NTP DATA
A FEW MORE EXCITING DISCOVERIES AND THEN THE END OF AN ERA

THANK YOU ALL WHO MADE THIS SHIP POSSIBLE IT'S BEEN A GREAT RIDE
MESSENGER DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE IT RAN OUT OF FUEL AND WAS VAPORIZED IN IMPACT WITH MERCURY LIKE A YEAR AGO AND THERE WASN'T AN ECLIPSE THIS WEEK
AND BY THIS YOU MEAN THE ONE 2 YEARS AGO STILL THIS IS ON PAR WITH PALE BLUE DOT IN EXISTENTIAL AWESOMENESS
THIS MUST BE A REPOST CONSIDERING THE TITLE MESSENGER CRASHED AGAINST MERCURY A YEAR AGO AND ON YOUR OWN GIF IT SAYS WHICH IS NOT PRECISELY THIS WEEK ECLIPSE SPECIALLY WHEN THERE WASN'T ONE THIS WEEK

I AM A BOTANY FAQ CODE
I DONT REMEMBER THEM PUBLISHING A SCIENTIFIC PAPER OR IF THEY DID IT WASNT VERY WELL PUBLICIZED HOWEVER I DO REMEMBER ONE OF THE CASSINI MISSION SCIENTISTS TALKING AT A PRESS CONFERENCE CANT REMEMBER WHICH ONE SORRY QUITE A FEW MONTHS AGO THAT THE DATA FROM THE FLYBY INDICATED THAT THE OCEAN HAD A PH OF WHICH IS HIGHLY ALKALI AND INDICATES SERPENTISATION IS OCCURRING AT THE SEA FLOOR A CHEMICAL REACTION THAT OCCURS AT HYDROTHERMAL VENTS AND COULD BE AN ENERGY SOURCE FOR LIFE

THIS INFO ALL CAME FROM A SCIENTIST WHO WAS ATTENDING THE CONFERENCE AND THE SPEAKERS SO THERE'S NO ARTICLE OR FURTHER INFO I CAN LINK TO SORRY PEOPLE ON TWITTER OFTEN PLANETARY SCIENCE CONFERENCES THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS LIVESTREAMED GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL A PAPER IS RELEASED FOR DETAILS


EDIT THE RESULTS OF THE FLYBY WILL BE ANNOUNCED SOME TIME AROUND DECEMBER ACCORDING TO THIS HETP ARTICLE U BOBSMO FOUND
MOSTLY CHOCOLATE WITH TRACE ELEMENTS OF AUGET PEANUT BUTTER AND HAZELNUTS IT TOOK SO LONG TO IDENTIFY BECAUSE THE RESEARCHERS KEPT EATING THE SAMPLES
YES I'VE BEEN ALSO ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THIS DATA

I SUSPECT YOU ARE SECRETLY EAGER TO SEE THAT DATA FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I AM SECRETLY EAGER TO SEE THAT DATA ALIENS



SO YA LIKE YOU I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CONTEMPLATE AND READ BETWEEN THE LINES ABOUT WHY IT'S TAKING SO LONG

PERSONALLY MY MAIN CONCLUSION IS THIS

I SUSPECT IF THERE HAD BEEN A STRONG HINT AT THE SCIENTISTS INVOLVED WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTAIN THEMSELVES FOR THIS LONG

YES AT FIRST THEY WOULD SAY CALM DOWN EVERYONE CALM DOWN LET'S TAKE A OUR TIME HERE BUT BEING HUMAN BEINGS THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTAIN THEMSELVES FOR OVER YEAR LIKE THIS IN MAKING THE GREATEST AND MOST IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY THUS FAR

THEY JUST WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO IT

IF THERE WAS A VERY STRONG SIGNAL OF LIFE THEN HINTS ABOUT IT WOULD HAVE ALMOST CERTAINLY LEAKED OUT ALREADY

SO SADLY I SUSPECT IT'S PROBABLY A BAD SIGN THAT IT'S TAKING SO LONG FOR US TO GET THE DATA AND FINAL REPORT

I THINK THE FINAL REPORT WILL PROBABLY BE VERY MUNDANE IN COMPARISON TO WHAT WE'RE SECRETLY HOPING FOR



HOWEVER

IF THEY GOT A FRUSTRATING AMBIGUOUS POSSIBLE LIFE DETECTION THEN YES I CAN SEE THEM FORCING THEMSELVES TO DELAY AND WAIT AS THEY CONTINUE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATIONS

WE'VE SEEN 2 BIG AMBIGUOUS OVERLY EXCITED POSSIBLE LIFE DETECTION ANNOUNCEMENTS MADE BEFORE BY NASA PERHAPS PREMATURELY INCLUDING OF COURSE

THE S VIKING MARS LANDER EXPERIMENTS AND THE S AL MARS ROCK

SO WITH AMBIGUOUS RESULTS THEY PROBABLY DON'T WANT THOSE SCENARIOS COMING UP YET AGAIN IN FRONT OF THE WORLD PRESS SO THAT COULD CERTAINLY DELAY THEM



AND OF COURSE THE ORIGINAL SCIENTISTS GET FIRST CRACK AT THE DATA AND HAVE TO WRITE THEIR PAPERS AND THEN GET THOSE PAPERS PEER REVIEWED

AND THEN THEY SOMETIMES HAVE TO THEIR PAPERS AFTER PEER REVIEW

ALL OF THIS CAN OFTEN TAKE ABOUT YEAR GIVE OR TAKE A FEW MONTHS SO I THINK WE'RE STILL WITHIN THE NORMAL TIME FRAME

IF IT GOES OUT TO YEAR AND MONTHS THEN I PERSONALLY WILL BEGIN TO BECOME SURPRISED AND ALSO A BIT SUSPICIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS EXACTLY GOING ON WITH THAT DATA AND IT'S ANALYSIS

I THINK AT THAT POINT THEY WILL BEGIN TO OWE THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND THE US TAX PAYERS WHO FUND THE MISSION SOME ANSWERS ABOUT THAT DATA WHICH MANY PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY ANTICIPATING AND WAITING FOR EAGERLY

BUT YES LIKE YOU I WAS VERY MUCH HOPING FOR AN EARLIER DATA RELEASE



EDIT AND OF COURSE THE EQUIPMENT INVOLVED IN THIS DOESN'T INVOLVE PROPER INSTRUMENTS

NASA JUST HAPPENED TO NOTICE ENCELADUS HAD A BUNCH OF AWESOME ERUPTING INTO SPACE AND SHRUGGED THEIR SHOULDERS AND SAID WHAT THE HECK AND AIMED THE CASSINI PROBE RIGHT THROUGH IT

I IMAGINE THE IMPACT WITH THE MATERIAL IN THE GEYSERS WAS ALSO A PRETTY HIGH SPEED

SO I'LL THINK WE WILL NEED PROPER FINDING MISSIONS TO ENCELADUS AND EUROPA AS WELL
THE RESULTS OF THE FLYBY WILL BE ANNOUNCED SOME TIME AROUND DECEMBER ACCORDING TO THIS HETP ARTICLE U BOBSMO FOUND
IT DOES SEEM POSSIBLE WHETHER THERE ACTUALLY ARE OR NOT I'M NOT SURE IF ANYONE COULD TELL YOU FOR CERTAIN WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING PICTURES OF VOLCANOES OR GEYSERS FROM A LANDER BREAKING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE

WHILE NEPTUNE IS A GAS GIANT IT IS NOT JUST A BALL OF GAS IT HAS LAYERS LAYERS OF GASES LIQUIDS AND ROCKS IT HAS A MANTLE A CORE AND AN ATMOSPHERE LIKE OTHER PLANETS ICES LIQUIDS ON NEPTUNE LARGELY CONSIST OF AMMONIA METHANE AMMONIUM HYDROSULFIDE AND WATER WITH POSSIBLE TRACE AMOUNTS OF NITROGEN TEMPERATURES ON NEPTUNE RANGE FROM AT THE CLOUD TOPS TO C AT THE CENTER PRESSURES REACH AT THE CENTER IT SEEMS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE LIKELY EVEN THAT THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST SOME VOLCANOES OR GEYSERS BUT THEY WOULD LIKELY CONSIST OF THE ICES MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY INSTEAD OF NITROGEN DUE SOLELY TO ITS LACK OF ABUNDANCE ON NEPTUNE

WIKI NEPTUNE
WELL SEEING AS NEPTUNE IS A GASEOUS PLANET IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO HAVE VOLCANISM AS WE TYPICALLY THINK OF IT THERE LIKELY ISN'T A SOLID SURFACE SO IT WOULD JUST BE GASSES PASSING THROUGH OTHER GASSES MORE LIKE WEATHER SYSTEMS THAN VOLCANOS
I THINK IF THE SPACESHIP IS THE ONLY OTHER OBJECT FOR YOUR FRAME OF REFERENCE AND RELATIVE TO THE SPACESHIP YOU ARE NOT MOVING THEN FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES YOU CAN CONSIDER EVERYTHING STATIONARY
MOVEMENT IS RELATIVE MOVING AT S IN RELATION TO WHAT RIGHT NOW YOU ARE NOT MOVING IN RELATION TO YOUR COMPUTER BUT YOU ARE MOVING AROUND THE CENTER OF EARTH AND AROUND THE SUN AND AROUND THE CENTER OF THE GALAXY ETC YOU CAN PLACE YOUR FRAME OF REFERENCE ANYWHERE YOU WANT

YOU COULD ONLY KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE ROTATING OVER YOUR OWN AXIS IN RELATION TO EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE YOU WOULD FEEL THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE
DELETED
I DISCOVERED HOW TO MOVE ANYWHERE IN THE GALAXY FROM READING POSTS HERE
BASICALLY PUT YOU NEED TO STOP MOVING RELATIVE TO EVERYTHING IF THE EARTH IS ORBITING THE SUN AT X SPEED AND THE SUN IS ORBITING A BLACK HOLE AT Y SPEED AND THE BLACK HOLD IS ORBITING ANOTHER MASS AT Z SPEED WE ARE GOING VERY FAST IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS IF WE CAN PUT CREATE AN OPPOSITE MOTION TO ALL AXIS AND COME TO A COMPLETE STOP WE WILL BE GOING EXTREMELY FAST RELATIVE TO WHATS AROUND US NOW YOU CAN CHOOSE A DIRECTION AND BLAST OFFICIAL GOING TO BED
BEING ABLE TO SET UP SOMETHING ON THE MOON WOULD BE AN AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT WE COULD THEN USE IT AS A BASE TO EXPAND OUT
ALSO EXCELLENT ARE BRAIN THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE AND THE FABRIC OF THE COSMOS SOMEWHAT MORE THEORETICALLY INCLINED THAN COSMOS THOUGH
I'LL JUST ADD THE OBLIGATORY NOTE THAT OF COURSE R COSMOS IS A THING
I THINK THE SERIES WAS GOOD AND WELL INTENTIONED ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY I PREFER THE ORIGINAL VERSION HOSTED BY SAGAN AS DATED AND LACKING IN KILLER VISUALS AS IT MIGHT BE
I REALLY ENJOYED BOTH THE OLD AND NEW COSMOS

THE SAGAN VERSION WAS SO POETIC THOUGH
VERSION IS PRETTY GOOD

BUT ORIGINAL IS FAR FAR BETTER

DUDE WATCH THE OLD ONE TYSON IS COOL BUT HE ISN'T AS AMAZING AS SAGAN WAS AT EXPLAINING THINGS
DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND GET STONED BEFOREHAND YOU WON'T REGRET IT
STILL WAITING ON A 2ND SEASON WATCHED ALL THE WAY THROUGH LIKE TIMES AND LIKE A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME EACH BIT BUILT UP TO THE NEXT TO REALLY DEFINE AND EXPLAIN CONCEPTS NORMALLY BEYOND GRASP AT LEAST FOR QUITE A FEW INCLUDING MYSELF GREAT SHOW
ALL THE EPISODES OF THE ORIGINAL COSMOS ARE ON YOU TUBE THEY HAVE THE UPDATES TAGGED ON TO THE END OF EACH EPISODE AS WELL
THE POLAR BEAR SEGMENT OF COSMOS WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME THE CONCEPT OF EVOLUTION REALLY CLICKED WITH MY WIFE THE SCHOOL WHERE SHE GREW UP IN RURAL IDAHO COMPLETELY FAILED AT EXPLAINING EVOLUTION SO THE IDEA JUST SEEMED RIDICULOUS TO HER UP UNTIL THAT POINT
I WATCHED THE ORIGINAL COSMOS I WATCHED THE NEW MODERN VERSION WITH TYSON

THIS MEME SUMS IT UP NICELY
CONVERSATION WITH PLUTO
COSMOS WAS GOOD BUT IT DOESN'T STAND UP TO BRIAN COX WONDERS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE SERIES TWO OF MY FAVORITE SEGMENTS

BRIAN EXPLAINS ENTROPY USING A SANDCASTLE IN A DESERT

BRIAN EXPLORES CATASTROPHIC FLOODING ANALOGUES FOR MARS ON EARTH
I LOVE COSMOS AGREED THAT SOMETIMES THE NARRATIVE IN SOME EPISODES MIGHT JUMP BACK AND FORTH BUT I DIDN'T FIND IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND
I'M AN ATHEIST AND A MAN OF SCIENCE BUT EVEN I FIND THE HISTORICAL CARTOONS BIASED THEY LEAVE OUT INCONVENIENT TRUTHS THAT CONTRADICT THEIR NARRATIVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT GIORDANO BRNO WAS ACCUSED OF PLAGIARIZING MARSILIA FICINO AT OXFORD

I DON'T WANT A NARRATIVE WITH COMICALLY VILLAINOUS CHURCH CLERGY AND AN IRONICALLY MESSIANIC HERO I WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH IS THAT SO BAD
I JUST FINISHED EPISODE 2 AND MY MIND IS COMPLETELY BLOWN FOR THE RECORD I'M NOT IN SCIENCE BUT I FOUND IT PRETTY EASY TO UNDERSTAND I'M A VISUAL LEARNER SO THE IMAGES DEFINITELY HELP SUCH A COOL SHOW I HAD NO IDEA A WATER BEAR EXISTED UNTIL NOW AND THE EVOLUTION OF HOW THE EYE CAME TO BE SO FASCINATING
I RECOMMEND TO SEE ORIGINAL COSMOS A PERSONAL VOYAGE FIRST ITS MY FAVORITE SERIES
I STILL REALLY LIKE IT IF JUST BECAUSE IT CONVEYS THE SHEER SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE BETTER THAN MANY SHOWS

MY ONLY BEEFS IT OCCASIONALLY MISCHARACTERIZES PEOPLE GIORDANO BRUNO WASN'T REALLY PERSECUTED FOR HIS VIEW OF THE UNIVERSE CIRC AND IT'S HEAVY-HANDED IN ITS IDEOLOGY ALBEIT A GOOD IDEOLOGY AGAINST RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION
THIS SERIES WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND VERY INFORMATIVE I LEARNED A LOT WATCHING IT AND UNFORTUNATELY FORGOT MOST OF IT AFTER A YEAR
AS MUCH AS I LIKE NDT AND THAT VERSION THE BEST ONE FOR ME IS SAGAN IT AIRED WHEN I WAS

IT WAS ONE OF THE TRULY GREAT MEMORIES FROM GROWING UP
IF YOU ONLY HAVE TIME TO WATCH ONE SKIP THE COMMERCIAL BREAK CLIFFHANGERS AND FIND CARL ORIGINAL
ALTHOUGH I LIKE THE CONTENT IN THE SERIES SOMETHING ABOUT NEIL JUST DRIVES ME BONKERS HE SEEMS LIKE HE IS TRYING WAY TO HARD TO BE CARL SAGAN AND IT JUST DOESN'T FEEL NATURAL I DO APPRECIATE WHAT HE IS DOING TO BRING SCIENCE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC BUT WATCHING HIS VIDEO IS PAINFUL AND WHEN HE SPEAKS WITH OTHER LEADERS IN THE FIELD IT MAKES ME CRINGE NO DOUBT THIS WILL GET PLENTY OF DOWNVOTES BUT IT'S JUST MY OPINION
WASN'T SETH MACFARLANE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER ON THIS AS WELL I STILL THOUGHT IT WAS A DECENT MINI SERIES
IF YOU'RE EXPECTING THIS TO BE COMPLETELY ABOUT OUTER SPACE JUST ADJUST YOUR EXPECTATIONS A BIT NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON DOES A DECENT ALBEIT CHEESY AT TIMES JOB OF WALKING THE AUDIENCE THROUGH THE COSMOS FOR A FEW EPISODES BUT HE ALSO GOES DOWN TO THE ATOMIC AND SUBATOMIC LEVELS OF ENERGY

EVENTUALLY HE ALSO COVERS THE ENERGY LEVEL BETWEEN THE ENORMITY OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE MICROSCOPIC SUBATOMIC PARTICLES AND GOES OVER NATURE HUMAN EXISTENCE OUR SCIENTIFIC PROGRESSION AS A HUMAN RACE AND THE LIKE

TL R DON'T GO INTO IT EXPECTING A SERIES FULL OF COMETS ASTEROIDS PLANETS BLACK HOLES AND GALAXIES THE SERIES PAINTS ON A LARGE CANVAS OF SCIENCE DEF FRIENDLY
I ENJOY HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS MUCH MORE SEASONS WITH SCIENTISTS INTERVIEWED TO HELP EXPLAIN SO MUCH MORE THAN COSMOS AND MUCH OF IT IS NARRATED BY MIKE ROWE SORRY SAGAN AND TYSON
THE SAGAN COSMOS IS WAY WAY BETTER TYSON IS PROSELYTIZING HIS RELIGION OF SCIENCE BULLSHIT WHILE SAGAN JUST WANTS TO TELL YOU ABOUT COOL SHIT I CAN'T STAND NDT ANY MORE HE IS SUCH A DIVA ALONG WITH HAWKING OME STEVE SHUT UP ABOUT THE DAMN COMPUTERS
I LOVE THIS SHOW IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF STAYING UP LATE INTO SUMMER NIGHTS AT MY OLD HOUSE WATCHING IT WITH MY BROTHER AND STARGAZING BACK WHEN HE DIDN'T HATE ME

IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY MASTERFUL SHOW THAT BEAUTIFULLY CAPTURES SO MUCH WONDER IN THE WORLD
THE ORIGINAL SERIES GAVE ME CHILLS IT FELT SO FAMILIAR SOMEHOW EVEN WHEN I WATCHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME LIKE A WEIRD SENSE OF DEJA VU IN A REALLY GOOD WAY
INDEED IT'S GREAT BUT STILL STAYS IN THE SHADOW COMPARING TO ITS PREDECESSOR THE ORIGINAL COSMOS WITH CARL SAGAN HIS VOICE ALONE FULL OF PASSION MAKES IT ASTONISHING SEE THE NEW ONE BUT DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE OLD ONE IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE
HOW NICE I JUST FINISHED THE FIRST EPISODE

THERE IS SO MUCH I'M CURIOUS ABOUT AND JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN THIS SERIES IS A GREAT INTRODUCTION

IS THE DIRECTOR REALLY THE SAME SETH MACFARLANE THAT MAKES FAMILY GUY SEEMS LIKE SUCH A DIFFERENT PATH FOR HIM
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO START IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT PHYSICS AND MORE SPECIFICALLY SOME OBSCURE FIGURES OF SCIENTIFIC HISTORY I PERSONALLY LIKE THE ORIGINAL BETTER THE STYLE THE WRITING CARL BUT THIS IS A FINE SERIES AND WELL WORTH YOUR TIME

BRIAN WONDERS SERIES ARE ALSO ABSOLUTELY WORTH YOUR TIME FEWER CGI SCENES WHICH I CONSIDER A GOOD THING AND YET STILL A REMARKABLY CREATIVE SERIES OF EXPLANATIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES HE USES A SAND CASTLE TO EXPLAIN ENTROPY IT'S ONE OF THE CLEVEREST THINGS I'VE SEEN IN A SERIES LIKE THIS
I USED THIS SHOW TO FALL ASLEEP TO NOT BECAUSE IT'S BORING IT'S REALLY NOT BUT BECAUSE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON HAS SUCH A SOOTHING VOICE WHEN SPEAKING ON THIS SHOW

I WISH I COULD BUY THIS SERIES AS A DOWNLOAD INSTEAD OF HAVING TO STREAM IT
CAVEAT DON'T WATCH IT IF YOU'RE SLEEPY NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON HAS SUCH A SOOTHING VOICE IT'S LIKE FERGIE AND JESUS
I JUST MADE MY GIRLFRIEND WATCH AN EPISODE OF THIS LAST NIGHT SHE WOULDN'T STOP GROANING BUT AFTER MINUTES WAS HOOKED AND SHE KEPT BEING LIKE WHATTTT WTF THAT JUST BLEW MY MIND
NEW COSMOS SUCKED CARL OG VERSION IS THE VERSION TO WATCH MUCH MORE INTERESTING LESS GRAPHICS BS GREAT EXPLANATIONS AND HE BUILDS UP A FOUNDATION FOR YOU BEFORE GETTING INTO MORE ADVANCED MATERIAL
THE ORIGINAL SERIES THAT WAS HOSTED BY CARL SAGAN WAS BETTER IMO HIS LOVE FOR SCIENCE REALLY CARRIED THE SHOW IS OK BUT WAS LIKE POETRY
AH YES COSMOS
BACK WHEN NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON WAS STILL COOL
STILL I FIND IT MIRACULOUS THAT A PROGRAM SHOWN ON FOX AND DIRECTED BY BRANNON BRAGA THE PERSON WHO MADE THE SCIENCE IN STAR TREK VOYAGER RIDICULOUS CAME OUT SO INFORMATIVE
THAT BEING SAID I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY MISREPRESENTED AND TOOK SIDE ON SOME HISTORICAL FIGURES WHOSE LEGACIES ARE MUCH MORE DEBATABLE THAN THE SHOW PRESENTS

HARD TO UNDERSTAND I'VE FOUND THIS SHOW TO BE INSANELY COMPREHENSIVE
WE WATCHED A LOT OF THESE IN SCIENCE LAST YEAR WHENEVER MY TEACHER WAS OUT THEY WERE GREAT
I KID YOU NOT I GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WITH THIS STREAMING ON MY NETFLIX AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK
LOVE THIS AND HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS
WE NEED MORE LIKE COSMOS IN THE SAME STYLE AS AND THIS AIMED SQUARELY AT THE COMMON AMERICAN AIM HIGHER AND YOU'LL LOSE THE ATTENTION OF THE MASSES
I AM GOING TO AGREE THAT THIS SERIES IS GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE BROAD INTERPRETATIONS THE COSMOS SOME HISTORY BUT MOSTLY SPACE HOWEVER IF YOU LIKE SPECIFICS IN THE THINGS YOU READ ABOUT THIS IS NOT FOR YOU ITS SO GREAT BUT LEAVES YOU WANTING MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT THINGS
YOU KNOW WHAT PISSES ME OFFICIAL THEY HAVE THIS ON NETFLIX BUT NOT CARL LAGANS VERSION
I LOVE THIS SHOW WE HOMESCHOOL OUR CHILDREN AND I USE THIS SHOW AS PART OF OUR SCIENCE CURRICULUM
THERE'S A LOT OF BULLSHIT HISTORY THOUGH
I TRY TO RECATCH THIS SHOW ANNUALLY AT LEAST THERE'S REALLY SOMETHING FOR ANYONE WITH A BIT OF CURIOSITY IT'S SO CAPTIVATING AND MAGICAL
THIS SERIES REALLY BROKE IT ALL DOWN FOR ME AND HELP ME TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT THEORIES BEHIND OUR UNIVERSE
DIDN'T LIKE IT IT LOOKS REALLY COOL BUT I HAD THE FEELING THAT THE WAY HE REPRESENTED THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS BAD I HAD THE SENSE OF WATCHING SOMETHING AND NOTHING
AFTER I SAW IT ON TV I BOUGHT IT ON DVD IT WAS SO GOOD IT'S A MUST WATCH
I PREFER CARL LAGANS ORIGINAL OVER THE NEWER TYSON ONES

ACTUALLY BRIAN COX HAS A NUMBER OF SERIES ON THE BBC THAT ARE FIRST RATE HE IS VERY GOOD AT EXPLAINING COMPLEX THINGS

TYSON SEEMS STONED MOST OF THE TIME
DELETED
THIS REVIEW IS THE BEST



IT ONLY GETS BETTER WITH UNSUBSTANTIATED DOWN VOTES
THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS SHOW IS IT'S NOT AN ADULT SHOW THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE INFANTILIZATION OF EDUCATIONAL CONTENT AIMED AT ADULTS

THIS SHOW IS ESSENTIALLY A KIDS SHOW
HARD TO UNDERSTAND IN MY OPINION IT'S ACTUALLY TOO DUMBED DOWN SOMETIMES I'M NOT SAYING I'M A GENIUS AND I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING BUT THIS IS SOME PRETTY COMPLEX STUFF WHICH CAN'T BE SIMPLIFIED PROPERLY

MOST OF THE TIME HOWEVER IT'S AWESOME WATCH IN ON A BIG SCREEN TV IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE
IT'S ABSOLUTELY SAD THAT YOU'D LINK TO THE NEW VERSION OVER THE TIMELESS AND TRANSCENDENT CLASSIC WATCH CARL COSMOS YOU SCRUBS
YES THIS SHOW LITERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE I USED TO BE REALLY RELIGIOUS THEN I WATCHED THIS SHOW AND I REALIZED WHY RELIGION IS WRONG
I KNOW COSMOS GETS A LOT OF LOVE ON REDDIN AND OBVIOUSLY ALSO HERE ON R SPACE BUT AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO FINDS IT INCREDIBLY AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH
HISTORY'S THE UNIVERSE IS GREAT PARTICULARLY THE FIRST SEASON AND IT DOESN'T GET AS PREACHY AS NEW COSMOS
I ENJOYED IT BUT THOUGHT THEY SPENT TOO MUCH TIME ON THE HISTORICAL ASPECT I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON NOW AND WHAT'S TO COME IN THE FUTURE
IT'S FUN EVEN IF YOU UNDERSTAND SCIENCE WELL ALREADY THE VISUALS LONE ARE REALLY GREAT
MY PROBLEM WITH IS THAT HIS VOICE IS SO COMFORTING I KEEP FALLING ASLEEP
AGREE I'M QUITE A BOOB BUT HAVE WATCHED A FEW OF THESE EPISODES AND MADE ME FEEL BETTER VERY CALM AND ENTERTAINING SERIES TOO
I CONSIDER MYSELF SOMEWHAT KNOWLEDGABLE WHEN IT COMES TO SCIENCE PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY I STILL WAS COMPLETELY ENTHRALLED BY COSMOS I THINK IT'S GOT SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
DOES IT HAVE A LOT OF VISUALS OR IS IT MOSTLY SHOTS OF PEOPLE TALKING MY NEPHEW LOVES SPACE BUT A LOT OF THE STUFF ON SCIENCE IS SCIENTISTS TALKING AND THE REST ARE VISUALS AND AT I DON'T EXPECT HIM TO FIND WATCHING A GROWN UP TALK ALL THAT EXCITING FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD

I WOULD LOVE SOME KIND OF CARTOON OR SOMETHING LIKE THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS BUT ABOUT SPACE FOR HIM
THE THING THAT I LOVED THE MOST ABOUT THE SERIES WAS THE ANIMATION STORYTELLING IF SOMEONE DEPICTED ALL OF SCIENTIFIC HISTORY LIKE THAT I BET IT WOULD SPARK A LOT OF INTEREST IN YOUNGER AGE GROUPS
ALSO CARL COSMOS SERIES IS AMAZING IN EVERY WAY HIS VOICE IS OOOO SOOTHING
THEY PUT THE ENTIRE EXISTENCE OF THE UNIVERSE INTO A MONTH CALENDAR FOR PERSPECTIVE OUR INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION STARTED ON THE LAST SECOND OF THE LAST DAY OF DECEMBER OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES DEFINITELY SMOKE BEFORE WATCHING
THIS SHOW WAS THE MOST POPULAR IN THE WORLD FOR SOME TIME THEN GOT OVER TOOK IT
MOON SHOT FROM JJ ABRAMS IS ANOTHER GREAT ONE EPISODES

NEWS BLOG
FIRST NIGHT A BINGE WATCHED A FEW EPISODES OF COSMOS WHEN I WENT TO BED I HAD A WICKED DREAM I WAS ON VENUS JUPITER AND WHATEVER OTHER PLANET IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM I FELT LIKE VISITING

IT WAS LUCID AND I KNEW I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ON ANY OF THESE PLANETS BUT THE DREAM CONTINUED IT WAS AWESOME
GREG FRANKLIN AND THE ANIMATION CREW AT POINT HARNESS DON'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT FOR THE QUALITY BEHIND THE SCENES WORK THEY DID ON THIS SERIES
A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF TIME AND THE UNIVERSE IN A NUTSHELL BY STEPHEN HAWKING ARE EXCELLENT FOR GRASPING HIGHER ORDER PHYSICS AS WELL
FOR THOSE WHO MISS THE CARL SAGAN VERSION DEMETRI MARTIN HAS A GREAT PARODY SERIES CALLED OUR FASCINATING PLANET

LINK FOR THE LAZY
WATCH V UNHID
I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THE ORIGINAL SERIES THIS IS BASED ON COSMOS IT'S HOSTED BY CARL SAGAN AND I THINK THE WRITING WAS EVEN MORE APPROACHABLE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND
2 WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE SERIES PEOPLE FIND HARD TO UNDERSTAND I AM JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED IN SCIENCE COMMUNICATION IS IT THAT THE IDEAS ARE TOO NEW ANALOGIES NOT USED ENOUGH ANALOGIES USED TOO LIBERALLY TO THE POINT YOU LOSE TRACK DO YOU NOTICE ANY PATTERNS IN WHAT IS DIFFICULT
JACOB ASCENT OF MAN IS ON PAR WITH COSMOS IMO REALLY WONDERFUL SERIES

HERE'S THE PLAYLIST

PLAYLIST
COSMOS IS MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT ANY FORM OF MEDIA IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE HUMAN EXPERIENCES
WORD CLOUD OUT OF ALL THE COMMENTS HETP

I HOPE YOU LIKE IT
HOW MANY SEASONS ARE THERE I ONLY HAVE SEASON ON NETFLIX AND PLANNED TO WATCH IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE
THIS IS THE SERIES THAT KICKED OFF MY LOVE OF SPACE AND SCIENCE EVER SINCE IT AIRED I'VE BEEN A NUT AS I WORK I USUALLY HAVE SOME SORT OF PANEL OR DEBATE PLAYING WHY WASN'T I THIS INTERESTED WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL
I LIKE THE SERIES BUT YOU FORGOT TO MANSION THAT IS ALSO FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD
I WATCH IT WHEN I'M HIGH ONE TIME I FELL ASLEEP WITH MY LAPTOP NEXT TO ME WHILE WATCHING AND PASSED OUT HALF ON MY LAPTOP WHEN I WOKE UP THE WEIGHT OF MY BODY ON THE LAPTOP HAD CRACKED THE TRACKPAD A BIT DON'T COSMOS AND WEED FUM
I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS SERIES WAS DISAPPOINTED IT CAME ACROSS AS BEING PRODUCED TO MAKE SCIENCE FOR SHELTERED CHRISTIAN KIDS
ARE THERE ANY TALKS OR INTENTIONS KNOWN OF THEM BRINGING THIS SHOW BACK FOR MORE SEASONS

IT'S A GREAT SERIES FOR PEOPLE WHO DO UNDERSTAND IT TOO IT'S JUST A GREAT SERIES
I STILL USE MY EX ROOMMATES NETFLIX ACCOUNT AFTER I MOVED AWAY THEY'RE ALL SERIOUS CREATIONIST NOW EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I GO TO EACH OF THE PROFILES AND PLAY AN EPISODE OF COSMOS SO IT APPEARS IN THEIR CONTINUE WATCHING SECTION IT'S MY ONGOING ROOMMATE REVENGE SINCE THEY NEVER CHANGED THEIR PASSWORD

ON A RELATED NOTE ANYONE KNOW OF SIMILAR SCIENTIFIC SHOWS IN THE KIDS SECTION OF NETFLIX
HOW THERE HASN'T BEEN A SECOND SEASON YET I HAVE NO IDEA SEASON ONE WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
THIS SERIES GOT ME THROUGH SOME LOOING NIGHTS UP WITH MY NEWBORN SON

ALSO THE CONTENT WAS A
I FOUND THE ORIGINAL COSMOS MUCH BETTER AND EASIER TO UNDERSTAND BUT CARL SAGAN WAS A GOD
OH MY GOD I LOVED IT I WATCHED TWO OR THREE EPISODES AND JUST WAS GAPING LIKE A FOOL THE WHOLE TIME I LOVED THEM IT'S SO GOOD
HERE'S A LINK TO THE WHOLE SERIES ENJOY
THIS IS THE SHOW THAT FINALLY EXPLAINED SCIENCE ENOUGH TO ME FOR ME TO STOP BELIEVING IN A GOD I FEEL MUCH MORE INFORMED NOW
SERIOUSLY OP DO YOU THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS YET
CARL COSMOS A PERSONAL VOYAGE IS WONDERFUL IF YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURAL WORLD CAN MAKE EVERYTHING SEEM MAGICAL

THAT'S THE KEY DIFFERENCE IN BOTH VERSIONS I THINK IS INFORMATIVE IS ENLIGHTENING OF COURSE BOTH HAVE THE ASPECTS OF BOTH BUT ONE PREDOMINATES
JUST STARTED WATCHING THIS YESTERDAY STUMBLED ACROSS THE STARTALK PODCAST LAST WEEK AND HAVE BECOME SUPER INTERESTED IN SO MANY NEW THINGS I HAVE DEFINITELY LEARNED A LOT
THE CALENDAR PERSPECTIVE REALLY PUTS INTO PERSPECTIVE JUST HOW FUCKING OLD THE UNIVERSE IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING
THIS NEEDS TO BE SHOWN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS I'VE GOT NO DOUBT THERE ARE GREAT SCIENCE TEACHERS OUT THERE BUT THIS SERIES DOES A NEAR PERFECT JOB OF MAKING EVERYTHING SOUND BOTH FASCINATING AND ACCESSIBLE AT THE SAME TIME
OK THE ORIGINAL WAS GREAT BUT IT'S YEARS OLD WHY ARE SO MANY PEOPLE SHITTING ON THE NEW ONE WE DIDN'T EVEN PROVE THE MIDDLE STAGES OF ACCRETION UNTIL THE MID
AND NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON IS THE BEST I WISH SCIENTISTS HAD TRADING CARDS LIKE BASEBALL JUST MUSING ON REDDIN I GUESS
WATCH THE EPISODE S ON CLIMATE CHANGE OF YOU'RE A DENIER HE LAYS IT OUT VERY WELL AND ADDRESSES A LOT OF THE CLAIMS BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARGUE AGAINST IT EXISTING
I WISH THEY DID MORE THAN ONE SEASON THOUGH I UNDERSTAND MR TYSON IS A BUSINESS PERSON WITH HIS SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS INTERVIEWS AND RESEARCH FOR HIS ACTUAL JOB BUT IT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION THE HIM DOING A SERIES LIKE THIS WAS A GREAT SERVICE TO THOSE OUTSIDE THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IT MAKES THE SUBJECT MORE APPROACHABLE FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON

I'VE ALSO GOT A FEELING IT WAS A BIG DEAL TO HIM PERSONALLY AND EMOTIONALLY GIVEN HE WAS DOING THE DIRECT FOLLOWUP TO HIS MENTORS SHOW OF THE SAME NAME I GET HIS REASONS FOR ONLY DOING THE ONE SEASON I GUESS I'M JUST BEING A BIT SELFISH IN WISHING HE DID MORE
I WATCH THIS ALL THE TIME DEFINITELY HELPED AIDED MY CURIOSITY OF SPACE WOULD RECATCH AGAIN
I THINK HE DUMBS IT DOWN AS FAR AS IT WILL GO SO I DON'T REALLY SEE WHY IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE PREMISE OF THE SHOW IS TO EXPLAIN THE METHODS AND MOST INFLUENTIAL DISCOVERIES OF SCIENCE IN A WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND

IN FACT I THINK HE DOESN'T GO INTO ENOUGH DETAIL ABOUT MOST TOPICS AND HE HEAVILY RELIES ON THE VISUALS TO DO THE EXPLAINING FOR HIM CARL SAGAN DID A MUCH BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING THE TOPICS FOR THE SCIENTIFIC ILLITERATE AND GOES INTO THE REAL CONCRETE DETAILS OF THE TOPICS I FIND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THE CARL SAGAN VERSION OF COSMOS FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTS IN BETTER DETAIL

IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME NICE VISUALS WITHOUT A LOT OF SUBSTANCE I WOULD WATCH THE NDT COSMOS BUT I AM AN ENGINEER SO I AM OBVIOUSLY REALLY BIASED
I FOUND THE NEW COSMOS REALLY LACKING IT WAS BASICALLY A HISTORY LESSON ON SCIENCE RATHER THAN ABOUT SCIENCE

I THINK BRIAN DOCUMENTARY SERIES THE WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE THE WONDERS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND THE WONDER OF LIFE WERE FAR FAR SUPERIOR PLUS COX HAS THE SAGAN VIBE THAT NDT IS SEVERELY LACKING
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO HATED THIS SHOW I WAS SUPER EXCITED FOR IT IT WAS TOO GEARED TO CHILDREN I GET IT BUT I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS MUCH THERE AND THE HISTORY LESSONS WERE WEIRD
IND DOWNVOTES BUT THE SEQUEL IS VASTLY DUMBED DOWN COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL IT'S ALSO UNNECESSARILY POLITICALLY CHARGED BECAUSE SETH MACFARLANE CAN'T HELP BUT DO THAT TO EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES

BBC WONDERS OF THE UNIVERSE WONDERS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND WONDERS OF LIFE ARE FAR MORE RELEVANT
YOU MIGHT GET MORE OUT OF PBS COSMO IS A LITTLE TO FLASHY FOR ME
CAN'T TAKE TYSON ANYMORE HE SEEMS PRETTY HAPPY TO BE NEIL TYSON
HARD TO UNDERSTAND DID YOU DROP OUT OF MIDDLE SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
I LOVE THIS ONE

HOWEVER MY DAD STILL WONT BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE
IF YOU DON'T MIND NEIL TYSON DEGRASSE TALKING TO YOU LIKE YOU ARE YEARS OLD
THIS SERIES WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT ITS REALLY NOT WORTH WATCHING DOWN AND PREACHY SCIENCE IF ANYONE IS ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN SOME SCIENCE THEN WATCH THE ORIGINAL COSMOS WITH CARL SAGAN
NUMBER COSMOS IS A PILE OF SHIT

WATCH THE UNIVERSE SERIES

COSMOS IS LIKE A DIET SODA WHERE COSMOS IS CLASSIC COKE
I GUESS I AM PART OF THE MINORITY WHO FOUND IT PRETTY MEDIOCRE TYSON IS OK AS HOST BUT THE CONTENT WASN'T ANYTHING GROUNDBREAKING SOME OF THE PRODUCTION VALUES LIKE THE CARTOONS WERE PRETTY WEAK AND MUCH OF THE HISTORICAL CONTENT IS LAUGHABLY BIASED AND MISLEADING PARTICULARLY IN ITS EFFORTS TO EXAGGERATE THE CONFLICT BETWEEN RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND SCIENCE

IT IS BASICALLY EXACTLY WHAT A STEREOTYPICAL REDDITION LATE TEENS EARLY TWENTIES LIKES SCIENCE ON A FAIRLY SHALLOW LEVEL ATHEISTIC AND STRONGLY ANTI RELIGION WOULD WANT IN A SHOW AS FAR AS AN ACTUAL PROGRAM ON SCIENCE AND SPACE IT'S PRETTY AVERAGE
THINGS ARE REALLY BIG AND THINGS ARE REALLY SMALL ALSO THE BIG THINGS ARE SMALL AND SMALL THINGS ARE BIG THE UNIVERSE IS AMAZING
TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT TOUGH ESPECIALLY THE HISTORICAL SCENES BECAUSE THEY PREFER DRAMA OVER ACTUAL FACTS JUST TO MAKE IT MORE EXCITING TO WATCH
FUNNY HOW IN ALMOST EVERY SCENE HE HAS TO GET INTO HIS IMAGINATION MOBILE BUT YET THEIST ARE THE ONES WHO BELIEVE IN NON SENSE
THE BLACK GUY WAS NOTHING ON CARL THE BLACK GUY IS TO CONDESCENDING CARL WAS AN ENGAGING MAGICIAN OF KNOWLEDGE AND WORDS
THIS IS A VERY WELL PRODUCED VIDEO I'D BE EXITED TO SEE MORE OF YOUR WORK
AND WILL BE SENDING THIS TO ME VIA FEDEX UPS OR GOOD OL USPS BECAUSE IT'S THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND HE'S A FANTASTIC HUMAN BEING THANK YOU
HOW BIG WOULD A MODEL OF MARS BE IF HE KEPT BUILDING ALL OF MARS IN THIS SCALE

I WONDER IF ANYONE AT NASA HAS THOUGHT ABOUT USING A BIG 3D PRINTER TO RECREATE A FUTURE LANDING SITE ON MARS TO PRACTICE ROVING HERE ON EARTH

OR MAYBE WE CAN GET A DISNEY WORLD RIDE WHERE THEY RECREATE THE PATH OF CURIOSITY AND YOU RIDE ALONG IT THAT WOULD BE NEAT

BUT OTHER OPTIONS STRUCTURAL AND OR MECHANICAL ENGINEERING FOR BUILDING VEHICLES PHYSICS ESPECIALLY ASTROPHYSICS BOTANY WHAT CAN BE GROWN TO EAT IN SPACE MEDICINE PHYSIOLOGY EVEN NUTRITION IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT IN BOTH TIME MONEY I WOULD ALSO LOOK INTO GETTING A PILOTS LICENSE

BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE I'D LOOK AT THE VARIOUS INTERNSHIPS AND TYPE THINGS THAT YOU COULD DO IN ADDITION TO YOUR FORMAL SCHOOL WORK THE CONTACTS AND INSIDER KNOWLEDGE YOU GAIN IN SUCH PLACES WILL BE WORTH AS MUCH AS YOUR DEGREE
PROGRAMMING AND DATA MINING LARGE TELESCOPES GENERATE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED
NOT SURE IF THIS IS TRUE OR NOT BUT I HEARD ONCE THAT NASA EMPLOYEES MORE COMPUTER SCIENTISTS THAN IT DOES AEROSPACE ENGINEERS
SPACE RELATED IS INCREDIBLY BROAD I'M A PROFESSIONAL ASTROPHYSICIST AND WORK ALONG SIDE PEOPLE WITH MAJORS IN MATH CHEMISTRY PHYSICS ASTROPHYSICS ASTRONOMY NUMEROUS VARIATIONS OF ENGINEERING COMPUTER COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND VARIOUS COMBINATIONS NUANCES OF THE ABOVE PLUS SOME DEGREES I'VE FORGOTTEN ABOUT LONG STORY SHORT YOU NEED TO PICK SOMETHING THAT ALIGNS SOMEWHAT WITH YOUR CAREER GOALS AND INTERESTS BUT DON'T BACK YOURSELF INTO A CORNER AT THIS STAGE KEEP IT BROAD AT UNDERGRAD AND NARROW DOWN AS YOU PROGRESS TO GRAD SCHOOL IF IN DOUBT PHYSICS MATH UNDERGRAD WILL GET YOU GOING IN THE RIGHT GENERAL DIRECTION BUT YOU'D BE WISE TO GET MORE FOCUSSED AT GRAD SCHOOL

OH AND THE INTERN SUGGESTION FROM U WDM IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIA A LARGE NUMBER OF JOBS IN THIS FIELD ARE OBTAINED BY WORD OF MOUTH NOT BY ADVERTISEMENTS OR JOBS POSTINGS INTERNSHIPS GET YOU CONTACTS AND EXPERIENCE IT'S INVALUABLE IN A VERY COMPETITIVE JOB MARKET
COULD ALWAYS GET A SWEEPING JOB AT NASA LIKE THAT GUY IN THE SOUND TESTING CHAMBER
MORTY YOU CAN'T JUST HAD A WORD TO BURP SOMETHING AND MAKE IT REAL MORTY
NUMBER

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CONCEPTS OF LIGHT GETTING SLOWER TIRED OVER TIME AND THEY WERE PRETTY NONSENSICAL AND EASILY FALSIFIED
IT WOULD BE FAR SIMPLER TO TERRACIFORM MARS THAN THE MOON HOLDING ONTO AN ATMOSPHERE DEPENDS ON GRAVITY AND TEMPERATURE THE MOON IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE SUN ON A SOLAR SYSTEM SCALE AND SO IT WOULD NEED A LOT OF GRAVITY FOR THE ATMOSPHERE NOT TO JUST BOIL AWAY THE MOON IS SIMPLY TOO SMALL
MARS HAS A SIMILAR COMPOSITION AS EARTH IN FACT SOME THINGS ARE FOUND IN HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS IN THE SOIL

MARS HAS PLENTY OF

IRON

OXYGEN LOCKED UP IN THE REGOLITH OXIDES MOSTLY IRON OXIDE WHICH CAN BE RELEASED BY HEATING THE REGOLITH

CUBIC KILOMETERS OF WATER ICE IN THE NORTHERN CAP ALONE

ENOUGH LOCKED UP IN THE CAPS TO GIVE MARS AN ATMOSPHERE THAT WOULD BE OF A PRESSURE HIGH ENOUGH FOR HUMANS TO WALK AROUND WITHOUT PRESSURE SUITS IF RELEASED A INCREASE IN AVERAGE MARTIAN TEMPERATURE WOULD CAUSE A RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE EFFECT THAT WOULD CAUSE THE EVENTUAL MELTING OF ENOUGH MATERIAL FROM THE CAPS AND THE REGOLITH OVER THE ENTIRE PLANET TO THICKEN THE ATMOSPHERE THIS CAN BE DONE BY GENERATING FLUOROCARBONS OR CREATING A MIRROR IN ORBIT AND REFLECTING SUNLIGHT ONTO THE PLANET

LIKELY GEOTHERMAL SOURCES WHICH COULD PROVIDE CHEAP ENERGY AND HEATING FOR HABITATS LIKELY AS THE PLANET HAS SEEN VOLCANIC ACTIVITY RECENTLY GEOLOGICALLY

ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF LANDMASS AS ON EARTH FOR EVENTUAL USE

SENDING MANNED MISSIONS TO MARS SHOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER ALL OTHER MANNED ROBOTIC SPACE EXPLORATION FOR THE NEXT YEARS WE NEED PEOPLE EXPLORING MARS AND ONE OR MORE COLONIES STARTED




THE MOON HAS

ICE IN EXTREMELY SMALL AMOUNTS

HAS NO ATMOSPHERE OF NOTE

HAS CONSIDERABLY LESS GRAVITY

HAS REGOLITH THAT IS ESSENTIALLY PULVERIZED STONE WITH THE LUNAR DUST BEING MICRONS OR SMALLER WHICH CLINGS TO EVERYTHING CAN INCREASE RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER WHICH IS BAD IS VERY VERY ABRASIVE GETS INTO GASKETS AND CAN COMPROMISE THEIR ABILITY TO SEAL WITH RELATIVE EASE AND WITH REGULAR EXPOSURE ENTERING AIR LOCKS WITH DUSTY SUITS YOU CAN ONLY GET THEM SO CLEAN WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY LEAD TO ALL SORTS OF LUNG PROBLEMS RELATIVELY QUICKLY

THE NIGHT LASTS DAYS MARS HAS A NIGHT SIMILAR IN LENGTH TO ONE ON EARTH AND THE DAY LASTS DAYS

ETC
BEFORE YOU ASK A QUESTION LIKE THIS YOU SHOULD AT LEAST UNDERSTAND HOW TERRAFORMING MARS WOULD LIKELY BE ACCOMPLISHED ONCE YOU LEAN ABOUT THAT YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY THE MOON IS NOT A CANDIDATE FOR TERRAFORMING DO YOUR RESEARCH JUNIOR
I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH BUT DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE A SEQUEL I ALSO DON'T WANT ONE A SEQUEL WOULD ONLY TRULY BE INTERESTING IF IT WAS YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND I BELIEVE OUR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE WOULD MAKE IT COSTLY AND LESS GROUNDED IN REALITY THAN THE ORIGINAL
I DID FIND IT INTERESTING TO THINK ON THE FACT SHE IS ABLE TO ALTER THE FUTURE AND POSSIBLY THE PAST THE ALIENS COULD HAVE USED THIS POWER TO TRAVEL BACK YEARS AND INSTEAD DECIDE TO GO TO EARTH INSTEAD OF WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING TO ASK FOR HELP
UGH
BLDR
A SEQUEL WOULD TRULY RUIN IT IF ITS NOT EXECUTED CORRECTLY
UNLESS YOU ARE WAY THE HELL OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE YOU HAVE LIGHT POLLUTION THAT IS OBSCURING IT
NOTHING BUT IF YOU'VE LOOKED INTO HOW THAT'S DONE THE PRETTY PHOTOS YOU REALIZE HOW LITTLE INFORMATION THE HUMAN EYE TAKES IN CHECK R SPACEPORT AND LOOK FOR THE PHOTOS WHERE FOLKS POST THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF HOW THE SHOT WAS DONE

HERE'S ONE I SHARED WITH A PHOTOG FRIEND WHO LOVES SPACE PHOTOGRAPHY
UNFORTUNATELY MILKY WAY SEASON IS NOW OVER ALTHOUGH THE MILKY WAY IS ACTUALLY VISIBLE YEAR ROUND THE GALACTIC CORE IS BLOCKED BY THE SUN DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AS THE EARTH ROTATES AROUND IT THIS WAS ONE OF MY LAST MILKY WAY SHOTS OF THE YEAR TAKEN AT AN ABANDONED AIRSTRIP NEAR BON ECHO PROVINCIAL PARK IN ONTARIO CANADA

CAMERA SETTINGS NIKON SIGMA F F ISO EXPOSURE SHOTS TWO ROWS OF STICHEL IN MICROSOFT ICE
YOU CAN ACTUALLY PERCEIVE THE MILKY WAY WITH THE NAKED EYE IF THE SKY IS DARK ENOUGH IF YOU'RE ANYWHERE NEAR A CITY'S LIGHT DOME HOWEVER FAINT OBJECTS BECOME DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE

EDIT IF YOU'VE NEVER GONE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND LOOKED AT THE NIGHT SKY AFTER GIVING YOUR EYES MINUTES TO ADJUST TO THE DARK I RECOMMEND IT YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT HOW DIFFERENT THE NIGHT SKY IS
A LOT OF THOSE PICTURES ARE ALSO LONG EXPOSURES TAKING LOTS OF LIGHT OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME THE MAIN THING IS THE AS OTHER HAS SAID IS LIGHT POLLUTION IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GO OUT INTO THE COUNTRY ON A NIGHT WITH A NEW MOON THEN THE SKY LIGHTS UP WITH SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A TRANSLUCENT CLOUD
A LOT OF GOOD ADVICE SO FAR JUST DROPPING IN TO ADD THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO SEE IT EVEN IF THE CONDITIONS AREN'T ALL THAT GREAT I LIVE IN A CITY WITH CITIZENS OR SO LUCKILY AT THE CITY LIMITS ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER IT'S EASIER TO SPOT AND ON A CLEAR NIGHT I CAN SEE IT FROM HERE VERY VERY FAINT FROM MY BALCONY BUT JUST HALF A MILE FROM HERE IT'S HARD TO MISS NOT AS BRILLIANT AS IT IS UNDER TRULY DARK SKIES BUT IT'S STILL NICE

TL R FIND A DARK SPOT AND TRY ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER TIME
OR WE COLONIZE THE EARTH WHILE PRETENDING IT'S MARS AND SKIP THE WHOLE INTERPLANETARY LOGISTICS ISSUE
BULLSHIT MARS IS A SHIT OPTION TO LIVE ON FOR HUMANS AND PLANET EARTH IS FINE THE NO HOPE THING IS FOR THE HUMAN RACE
2 BILLION THE COST IS CLOSER TO BILLION DOLLARS

BUT NEVERTHELESS THAT LOOKS AWESOME FUN
CAN YOU GET DIZZY IN SPACE I MEAN WHEN YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE WOULDN'T YOUR INNER EAR JUST KINDA GO FUCK IT AND STOP WORKING WITH NEAR ZERO G
SOURCE
BUT FOR REAL WHEN WE GONNA GET ZERO GRAVITY ATTRACTIONS AT AMUSEMENT PARKS
DOES SPINNING IN ISS HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS ON EARTH WILL HE GET DIZZY OR FEEL WOOZY
I JUST READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE PLANNED TRIP TO MARS AND HOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE AROUND MONTHS NASA MENTIONED THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO CAN HANDLE A LONG PERIOD OF BORING AND THEN WHEN THEY LAND BECOME A HIGHLY ACTIVE INDIVIDUAL AFTER LOSING LOTS OF BONE MASS AND MUSCLE ITS FUNNY TO SEE ASTRONAUTS HAVING FUN IN SPACE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A HUGE MENTAL ASPECT TO SPACE TRAVEL

DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW THEY PLAN ON KEEPING ASTRONAUTS MENTALLY ENTERTAINED FOR THE MARS TRIP VR FARMING EXPERIMENTS
FUN FACT THE SHUTTLE ENTERED AN UNEXPECTED SPIN SO THEY HAD TO SPIN UP ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS THE OPPOSITE WAY TO SAVE IT S
WORD CLOUD OUT OF ALL THE COMMENTS HETP

I HOPE YOU LIKE IT
I HOPE BY THE TIME I'M OLD AND DECREPIT THERE ARE NURSING HOMES IN SPACE WHERE I CAN FLOAT AROUND AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES IN ZERO GRAVITY
COMMAND DAMNIT NO ANSWER FOR AN HOUR DO WE HAVE VISUAL OF WHAT'S GOING ON
CAMERA SHOT COMES INTO VIEW
COMMAND WE KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME
ISS THIS IS HOUSTON WHAT ARE YOU DOING

HOUSTON THIS IS ISS MMM SCIENCE
CAN YOU FART IN ZERO GRAVITY IF SO WILL IT PROPEL YOU OPPOSITE THE DIRECTION OF THE FART ASKING FOR A FRIEND
AND SOME SAY HE'S STILL SPINNING I MEAN HE'S PROBABLY ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SO MAYBE TECHNICALLY THEY ALL ARE
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I LOVED THE LAUGHING SCENE OF MARY POPPINS THE KIDS LAUGHED AND FLOATED UP TO THE CEILING AND ATE LUNCH I DREAMED IT COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN
I GUESS WITH ENOUGH MONEY OR TALENT ONE COULD REALLY DO THAT
HOW AMAZING

HEY U PIPONWA


THIS IS NOW THE TOP POST ON REDDIN IT WILL BE RECORDED AT R TOPOFREDDIT WITH ALL THE OTHER TOP POSTS
I WOULD RATHER SEE SCIENTISTS HAVE FUN WITH 2 BILLION WORTH OF TOYS THAN SOLDIERS KILL PEOPLE WITH 2 TRILLION WORTH OF TOYS
AH YES THE SIMPLE CHILDISH JOY OF SPINNING IN SPACE WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE AM I RIGHT FOLKS
THIS IS PROBABLY A DUMB QUESTION BUT IS THERE ANY FRICTION AS YOURE SPINNING AROUND OR WOULD YOU JUST TUMBLE AND SPIN ENDLESSLY OR UNTIL YOU GRABBED SOMETHING
I'M THINKING HITTING YOUR HEAD AT X SPEED HURTS JUST AS MUCH IN ZERO G AS IT WOULD ON EARTH

EDIT HM ON SECOND THOUGHT MAYBE NOT BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE MORE OF A RECOIL ACTION AND THEREFORE NOT ALL THE ENERGY IS DEPOSITED UPON IMPACT
WE'RE WHALERS ON THE MOON WE CARRY A HARPOON BUT THERE AIN'T NO WHALES SO WE TELL TALL TALES AND SING A WHALING TUNE
I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO GO TO DUBAI IT'S LIKE AN AMUSEMENT PARK WHERE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO ANYTHING
IN THEORY COULD SOMEONE SPIN FOREVER LIKE THIS I KNOW IN OPEN SPACE YOU COULD SPIN FOREVER BUT INSIDE THE ISS PRESSURIZED WITH AIR GASSES WOULD IT'D WORK THE SAME
MY ONE WISH WOULD BE TO VISIT THE ISS THOSE ASTRONAUTS LEAD A VERY SURREAL LIFE
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF A CHILD PLAYING WITH THE BOX THERE EXPENSIVE TOY CAME IN
I FEEL LIKE I WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED THIS FAR LESS WITHOUT MARIJUANA
DO YOU GET DIZZY FROM SPINNING LIKE THAT IN SPACE CONSIDERING ITS MICRO GRAVITY AND YOUR INNER EAR FLUID WOULD BE AFFECTED DIFFERENTLY R ASKSCIENCE
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WAS ISS AND WOULD SAY YOU NEEDED TO ADD TWO ZEROS TO THE 2 BILLION FIGURE BUT FOUND YOUR SOURCE COMMENT AND AS IT IS THE SPACE SHUTTLE YOU ARE ONLY OFF BY ABOUT BILLION IT'S STILL COOL

I LIKE TO BELIEVE THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THE ASTRONAUTS SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME DOING

EDIT A WORD
IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE IF YOU THROW UP THERE LIKE THAT VOMIT EVERYWHERE
CAN YOU STILL GET DIZZY IN SPACE NO GRAVITY AND ALL I GUESS YOU DON'T EXPERIENCE G'S RIGHT
WOULD YOU EVEN GET DIZZY DOING THAT I MEAN THERE'S NO GRAVITY SO WOULD IT STILL FEEL LIKE YOU WERE SPINNING
DO YOU GET DIZZY IN SPACE IS THE WHOLE INNER EAR THING RELATED TO GRAVITY
NOW FOR THE ISS VERSION OF THE CHAIR SPINNING CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM
YOU WOULDN'T GET MOTION SICKNESS FROM THIS RIGHT SINCE THERE'S NO GRAVITY
WAIT SO THIS IS WHY WE PUT ASTRONAUTS THROUGH ALL THOSE TESTS

SO WHEN THEY GET BORED IN SPACE THEY WONT PUKE FROM THE DOWN TIME ACTIVITIES

STILL WORTH IT
BOT BEEP BEEP I'M ALL ABOUT TOP POSTS

THIS POST HAD UPVOTES AND GOT POSTED TO TWITTER AND SUBREDDIT R REDDIN

THE TWEET



ALL UPVOTES ARE ON AND R REDDIN

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL POSTS ON AND R REDDIN
IF HE CLOSED HIS EYES WOULD HE GET DIZZY LIKE ONE WOULD SPINNING IN A CIRCLE LIKE THAT ON EARTH OR WOULD THE LACK OF GRAVITY PREVENT THE DISORIENTATION
DO YOU GET DIZZY WITH ZERO GRAVITY I KNOW DIZZINESS HAS SLOT TO DO WITH INNER EAR FLUID SLOSHING ABOUT
UHH HOUSTON UH-HUH I BARFED IN THE SPACE STATION
GOD I WANNA GO JUST FOR A WEEK JUST TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE AHHHHH MAYBE ONE DAY
I LOVE WATCHING HIS CENTER OF GRAVITY CHANGE ZERO GRAVITY IS A GREAT WAY TO SEE PHYSICS IN ACTION
THIS MIGHT BE A DUMB QUESTION BUT SINCE THERE'S NO UPSIDE DOWN IN SPACE WOULD THIS NOT MAKE HIM DIZZY
IT'S NOT LIKE THE MONEY IS FLOWN INTO ORBIT THE MONEY GOES BACK INTO THE ECONOMY
I WHEN YOUNGER THOUGHT THAT BEING AN ASTRONAUT WOULD BE THRILLING NOW I CANT HELP BUT FEEL IT MUST BE BORING I MEAN AFTER THE FIRST WEEK IT MUST GET VERY DULL UP THEIR
JUST DON'T SO DIZZY THAT YOU VOMIT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CLEAN UP I'D IMAGINE
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME PLEASE IN SPACE DO YOU GET THAT SAME SPINNING DIZZY FEELING YOU GET IF YOU WOULD DO THAT IN EARTH
NOW THAT I AM AM AN ADULT I REALIZE THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS ADULTS WE'RE ALL KIDS IMPERSONATING ADULTS
MUCH BETTER INVESTMENT THAN BAILING OUT CORRUPT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT WANTS HIM TO BE SICK JUST TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN SPACE

MUST BE ONE OF THE HAPPIEST MOMENTS OF HIS LIFE DAMN I WISH I COULD BE THERE XD
DOES SMASHING YOUR HEAD INTO METAL OBJECTS FEEL ANY DIFFERENT IN ZERO GRAVITY
HERE'S SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED DOES YOUR PERSPECTIVE CHANGE IN ZERO G BECAUSE THERE'S NO GRAVITY THERE IS NO UP OR DOWN SO WHEN YOU'RE UPSIDE DOWN OR FLOATING AROUND DOING SOMERSAULTS DOES IT FEEL ANY DIFFERENT LIKE DOES THE ORIENTATION OF YOUR BODY FEEL DIFFERENT CAN YOU TELL IF YOU'RE UPSIDE DOWN
HAHA LOOK AT THE SPINNING LIPS THE WHOLE TIME HE'S SCREAMING STOP STOP I'M GONNA PUKE I'M GONNA PUKE
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED IF PEOPLE IN GRAVITY HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT'S UP AND DOWN I CAN'T IMAGINE A WORLD NOT KNOWING WHICH WAY IS UP AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FEEL IT
MAN JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW FAR WE'VE GOTTEN WE ACTUALLY MADE HUMAN BEINGS ELEVATE TO SHOW THIS TO A PERSON YEARS AGO IT'LL FUCK WITH THEIR REALITY IT'S LIKE WE ACTIVATED A CHEAT CODE IN LIFE
DELETED
I BET I COULD GET THERE FASTER THAN THE FRONT OF THE LINE FOR THE NEW COASTER AT GREAT ADVENTURE ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND
THEY'RE UP THERE HAVING THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES BREATHING CLEAN RENEWABLE AIR AND LOOKING THAT HAPPY WITH THE SINGLE BEST VIEW OF THE PLANET

YEAH I'D SAY IT'S OKAY TO BE JEALOUS
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SEE A NEW PARK BEING BUILT LOLL
SPACE MEN ARE TENDER BUT SOMETIMES I FEAR AHET THEY GET SICK ALL ALONE UP THERE

VIDEO COMMENT

TIM DIZZINESS EXPERIMENT AN ASTRONAUT WANTED TO FIND OUT AND HERE IS THE ANSWER
SPACE SHUTTLE STS ATLANTIS SPACE STATION ASSEMBLY ISS COLUMBUS LAB NASA SOURCE
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO REMOVE ONESELF FROM THE IBO ISS MODULE THERE IS AIR SO THERE IS FRICTION THE SKYLAB SPACE STATION WAS SO BIG IN DIAMETER THAT THE ASTRONAUTS WOULD SOMETIMES GET STUCK IN THE MIDDLE AND HAD TO WAIT FOR THE AIR CURRENTS TO CONVEY THEN TO SOMETHING THEY COULD GRAB HOLD OF YOU CAN SWIM THRO
A GORILLA IN SPACE I THOUGHT THEY TRADED THE TOILET SEATS FOR THE GORILLA SUIT GORILLAS IN SPAAAAACE
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
I WOULD BE SO DISTRACTED IN THAT THING BUTTONS AND LEVERS EVERYWHERE
GUYS I KINDA WANNA BECOME A ASTRONAUT NOW HOW CAN I CONVINCE MY PARENTS
THE COOL PART

FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE HE'S STAYING STILL AND THE STATION IS TUMBLING OUT OF CONTROL AROUND HIM BECAUSE THERE IS NO GRAVITY ANCHORING A DOWN
ADAHA AHA AHAZIAH AHA OKAY STOP IT TED STOP NO TED HELP I WANT TO STOP IM SERIOUS STOP HELP ME TED
HIM PROBABLY
I THINK THAT'S REX WALDHEIM ON THE MID DECK OF THE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS THAT'S THE MOST FUN LIVING ROOM IN ANY VEHICLE
WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE FARTS IN THERE DOES EVERYONE JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE FUNK
WOW THAT RIDE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD
CAN ANYBODY GIVE ME A LINK TO THIS GIF IT WON'T WORK ON MOBILE AND MY COMPUTER BIT THE DUST
CAN YOU GET DIZZY IN SPACE I MEAN WHEN YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR A WHILE WOULDN'T YOUR INNER EAR JUST KINDA GO FUCK IT AND STOP WORKING WITH NEAR ZERO G
2 BILLION DOLLAR PLAYGROUNDS IS THE INEVITABLE CONCLUSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND HARD WORK
WHEN I WATCHED THIS I LOOKED AROUND TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE HIT THE WALLS OF THE OF THE SHIP COULD IT REALLY FUCK SOMETHING UP
THAT LOOKS LIKE A FUN AMUSEMENT RIDE OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING PUT TO GOOD USE
IF YOU ATTACHED A ROOM TO THE ISS THAT WAS A LONG PADDED TUBE COULD AN ASTRONAUT GET A WORKOUT IN BY LEAPING FROM WALL TO WALL MAYBE ADD RUBBER BANDS IN TOO NO GRAVITY BUT ARE YOUR MUSCLES WORKING BY PUSHING OFF THE WALL AND SUCH
HOW IS ONLY ONE OF THOSE 2 GUYS IS FREE OF GRAVITY AREN'T BOTH SUPPOSED TO BE FLOATING
NICE DOES THAT FEEL LIKE THE ISS IS SPINNING AROUND YOU WOULD HE EVEN FEEL ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE COOL VISUAL EFFECT
THAT LAST SECOND LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO CRASH INTO SOMETHING BAD
I'M PRETTY SURE HE BANGED HIS HEAD HARD AGAINST THE WALL AFTER THE VIDEO WAS CUT
THIS IS NOT FROM THE ISS IT IS FROM ONE OF THE SHUTTLES

THE BEVIS WAS HARD MOUNTED MID DECK ON THE SHUTTLE ON THE ISS IT IS MOUNTED ON A FRAME IN THE
PUT THIS YOUTUBE IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE WATCHING THIS TRUST ME
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S SAYING AT THE END WHEN HE'S SPINNING STOP ME LAO
IF I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS NEED TO BE UPDATED IF GETTING THERE NEEDS 2 BIL
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE TO EXPERIENCE LIVING IN SPACE THIS KIND OF CLIP MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I WOULD LOSE MY FUCKING MIND UP THERE
THIS RIDE PUTS OUT A WHOPPING ON TURNS AND YOU MUST BE THIS QUALIFIED TO RIDE IT
HOW DO YOU RECKON THIS CAME ABOUT
LIKE HEY TIM WHAT DO YOU RECKON WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU HELD THAT
LET'S FIND OUT
BECAUSE THERE IS NO GRAVITY WOULD YOU STILL GET THE SAME DIZZY FEELING IN SPACE
WAS ANYBODY ELSE WORRIED HE WOULD ACCIDENTALLY FLIP A SWITCH WITH HIS FOOT OR UNPLUG ONE OF THOSE LOSE WIRES IN THE BACKGROUND WHICH KEEPS THE SHIP IN A STABLE ORBIT
I SEE THEM FLIP LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME AND IM JUST WAITING UNTIL THEY HIT THERE HEAD ON SOMETHING
I WANT TO SEE SOMEONE USING THOSE LIPLESS PEDALS WEIGHTLESS WITHOUT A BIKE
ASTRONAUTS WE NEED FUNDING SO WE CAN EXPLORE DEEP INTO SPACE
MINUTES LATER
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE HELD ON WHILE IT SPAN RIDICULOUSLY FAST WOULD IT CAUSE HIM DAMAGE OR WOULD HE JUST SPIN AT LIKE CASUALLY ASSUMING HE WAS JUST FLOATING IN A VACUUM
YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY SEE THE TETHER PULLING ON HIS PANTS OPEN YOUR EYES SHEEPLET
CHUG A FEW TINS OF BEER HIT SOME OF THAT SPACE WEED DO THIS SPINNY THING PUKE EVERYWHERE WHAT'S THE COST OF THAT CLEANUP
APPARENTLY THE BILLION DOLLAR THEME PARK JUST AN HOURS DRIVE FROM THE LAUNCH PAD WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM
IS THERE A MAXIMUM ROTATIONAL SPEED IN SPACE COULD HE POTENTIALLY BE SPUN ROUND FAST ENOUGH TO BE IN PHYSICAL DANGER I REALLY REALLY NEED TO KNOW THIS
I DONT DENY THEM THEIR FUN THEY ARE TRAPPED AT WORK WITH THE REST OF THE EMPLOYEES I MEAN THE GENERAL OUTROAR WHEN SOMEONE MICROWAVES FISH AT WORK IS HARD TO DEAL WITH YET IT HAPPENS EVERY NOW AND THEN

I KNOW THAT IT WAS ALSO NOT MEANT AS WASTE THAT IT WAS MEANT IN THE SENSE THAT SPACE IS EXPENSIVE
DELETED
I READ ABASEMENT INSTEAD PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FAR OFF CONSIDERING HOW MANY TIMES THEY GET HURT DOING THAT
IF ASTRONAUTS COULDN'T HAVE FUN THEY WOULD GO CRAZY

IT SEEMS ODD TO ME THAT SPACE RELATED HEADLINES HAVE COST FIGURES

UNLESS YOU OPPOSE THE WORK OR ARE A FISCAL INSPECTOR COST DOESN'T MATTER OK MAYBE SOME ARE CURIOUS
IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES UNTIL YOU ACCIDENTALLY FLIP THE SWITCH THAT JETTISON YOU OUT INTO SPACE

I WATCH TOO MANY SCI-FI MOVIES
THE GIF ENDS RIGHT BEFORE HIS HEAD SMASHES INTO INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT
THE FACTORY I WORK AT IS A DOLLAR UNCOMFORTABLE READING CHAIR DURING MY BREAKS
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY IN SPACE WAS THE TIME WELL SPENT OR THIS AIN'T ACTUALLY ON A SPACE STATION
I KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT I'M JUST WAITING FOR HIM TO PUKE IN A SPIRAL
EXPENSIVE YES BUT NOT 2 BILLION DOLLARS I CAN BE AN EXERCISE DEVICE FOR LESS THAN THAT JUST PIN ME DOWN INTO THE FLOOR AND USE MY HANDS AS PEDALS
I READ THE TITLE AND NEARLY SHIT MYSELF THINKING THAT NASA WAS OPENING AN AMUSEMENT PARK IN SPACE IMAGINE MY DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN THE GIF LOADED
THIS CAN EASILY DONE IN A ZERO GRAVITY PLANE GOING BY THE TIME FRAME OF THE CLIP
DELETED
IF YOU DONT PAY FOR AMUSEMENT PARK THE ASTRONAUTS WILL GET SEVERE DEPRESSION AND SOME OF SPACE MISSIONS WILL FAIL PAY THEM MUCH
I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE HIM HIT HIS HEAD AFTER THE GIF ENDS THEY PROBABLY BROKE SOME EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT AND NEED TO HIDE IT FROM THE BOSSMAN
IF HE WAS IN SPACE HE WOULDN'T HAVE VEERED LIKE THAT IN THE END OF THE CLIP
I HEARD THEY HAVE TO EAT 3D PRINTED FOOD SO LET THEM HAVE SOME FUN
IS THIS SERIOUSLY WHAT MY TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING TOWARDS WHAT THE RIDICULOUS
THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF YEARLY BUDGET
DELETED
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT WOMEN CREATED THE SPACE STATION JUST SO THAT MEN COULD MESS AROUND SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT
HERE'S AN ARTISTIC REPRESENTATION OF THAT

ANDROMEDA IS BIGGER

SOURCE
ABOUT DEGREES OR TIMES LONGER THAN THE MOON

2 AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT COULD BE THE SAME SIZE OR IT COULD BE TWICE THE SIZE DEPENDING ON SOURCE IT GENERALLY THOUGHT THAT IT IS BIGGER


THE THIRD CLOSEST GALAXY IS SAGITTARIUS DWARF AFTER MILKY WAY AND CANIS MAJOR DWARF
THERE IS BUT FROZEN AS ICE UNDERGROUND AND IN DEEP CRATERS AT THE POLES
THERE IS ALSO GASEOUS WATER IN TRACES IN THE THIN ATMOSPHERE ABOVE MOON
WIKI
THE SOVIET SAMPLE RETURN MISSION LUNA FOUNDATION WATER IN LUNAR SOIL CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
THERES A HUGE CHANCE THAT THERES AT LEAST ONE MOLECULE ON THE MOON
ELON MUSK IS NOT A LEGEND HE MIGHT BECOME ONE IF HE GETS PEOPLE TO MARS BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE GOING TO MARS ANY LESS FAR-FETCHED

WE ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO SEND PEOPLE TO SUN EVERY PLANET IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND TO MANY MANY STARS MARS TOO

BUT WHAT TO HECK WE DO THERE LIVE MISERABLY SHORT TIME AND DIE

PROBES AND OTHER UNMANNED MISSIONS TELESCOPES ETC ARE THE WAY TO GO
SENDING SOME HARD TO MAINTAIN UNIT LIKE HUMAN IS NOT RECOMMENDED

ROBOTS ROVERS AND SUCH THRIVE IN THIS BOSSINESS
IT IS EXPECTED THAT THERE IS A LOT OF OXYGEN LOCKED UNDER THE SURFACE OF MARS ALSO LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER IN THE FORM OF ICE SHEETS ALL WE NEED TO DO IS GET A MAGNETIC FIELD GOING AND GET TO WORK ON CREATING A BREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE RAISE THE TEMP A BIT EASY PEASY WE MAY NEED TO BIO ENGINEER THE HUMAN SETTLERS A BIT SO THEY CAN SURVIVE THERE IF WE CANT MODIFY THE PLANET ENOUGH TO SUIT US WE CAN MODIFY US TO SUIT THE PLANET IT JUST TAKES THE WILL TO GET IT DONE
THIS ONE HETP
ALIENS ARE NEVER THE ANSWER HETP
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS THE WOW SIGNAL DOESN'T EXACTLY FIT ALL THE SPECS YOU HEARD BUT IT'S THE CLOSEST THING I CAN THINK OF
THIS ONE
THIS HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR QUITE SOME TIME HASN'T IT IT USED TO AND MAY STILL BE KNOWN AS THE GREAT ATTRACTOR
VERY FORWARD THINKING OF THEM TO NAME IT A WING BEFORE THE DISCOVERY OF THE B WING
LINK NASA SATURN MISSION PREPARES FOR ORBITS SCROLL DOWN
THERE'S A PRETTY DAMNING ANALYSIS ON R PHYSICS UNRELATED TO THIS ISSUE

R PHYSICS COMMENTS
LOVE THE WEEKLY SPACE HANGOUT AND ANYONE THAT FREQUENTS THIS SUB SHOULD WATCH IT EVERY WEEK THIS PART WITH PAUL M SUTTER WAS INTERESTING A GOOD INSIGHT INTO THE WHAT SCIENTIST GO THROUGH WHEN PRESENTING INFORMATION TO THEIR PEERS
EDIT RELEVANT PART OF VIDEO SHOULD BEGIN AT WHEN YOU CLICK ON IT



ASTROPHYSICIST PAUL M SUTTER PROVIDES A GOOD ANALYSIS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GRAPH FROM THE NASA EM PAPER IN EPISODE OF THE WEEKLY SPACE HANGOUT

UNFORTUNATELY IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE ERROR RATE HAS BEEN VASTLY IN THE PAPER

MORE PROBLEMATIC IS THAT IT COULD TAKE SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO A PROPER EXPERIMENT TO EVENTUALLY GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS

SUTTER ALSO MENTIONS ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THE SO CALLED EM DRIVE IF THESE RESULTS ARE TRUE THEY WOULD HAVE WIDE RANGING IMPLICATIONS AND OVERTURN A VAST SWATH OF KNOWN PHYSICS AND THEORIES SO MANY IN FACT THAT SURELY WE WOULD HAVE NOTICED ANOMALIES IN MANY OTHER PHYSICS EXPERIMENTS IN RELATION TO THIS WHICH WE HAVE NOT

COULD THE COPPER IN THE EM DRIVE BE GETTING AFFECTED BY THE MICROWAVES CREATING ANOMALOUS THRUST
I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH DR VIEW REGARDING THE MEASUREMENT ERROR UNDERESTIMATION
THE ERROR ESTIMATE PER MEASUREMENT IN THE RAW DATA IS ALMOST SOLELY DEPENDENT ON THE MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENT AND IF THEY CLAIM THE EQUIPMENT CAN IDENTIFY WITHIN A THEN I BELIEVE THEM AND THEY PROBABLY HAVE THE PROOF TO BACK IT UP

THE FACT THAT DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ON THE SAME POWER LEVEL ARE DIFFERENT BY MORE THAN MAKES PERFECT SENSE THESE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN IN DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME WITH A DIFFERENT MAGNETIC FIELD FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE SUN FACING A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WITH THE FRUSTUM AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE
HIS OWN PEOPLE IN THE ROOM SIMPLIFICATION IS ACTUALLY THE PERFECT EXAMPLE IF YOU MEASURE PEOPLE AT NOON MEASURING IN THAT VERY SAME ROOM AT DOES NOT MEAN YOUR MEASUREMENT IS WRONG AND IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT YOUR ERROR ESTIMATES
REMOVED
CAN YOU ANIMALS START PLACING DEGREE LIGHT ON YOUR FLOATING JUNK I JUST ABOUT HIT THIS THING WITH MY SHIP A TINCH AGO
TRULY A REMARKABLE NAMESAKE AND LINEAGE WITH THE ATLAS LINE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF CURRENT YEAR DOLLARS HAVE GONE INTO THE RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING THAT HAS ESTABLISHED THE ATLAS BOOSTER AS THE RELIABLE ROCKET ALL LAUNCH PROVIDERS TODAY STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF THOSE SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS AND BUSINESSPEOPLE WHO PAVED THE WAY FOR EXPENDABLE ROCKETS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT AMERICA AS A PEOPLE CAN DO FOR ROCKETS IN THE FUTURE WHETHER THE ATLAS LINE IS A PART OF THAT OR NOT
WOW ITS LIKE DISNEY PUTS REALLY GOOD MESSAGES AND THEMES INTO THEIR MOVIES OR SOMETHING
UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN JOANA IS A DISNEY STORY DERIVED FROM POLYNESIAN LEGEND AND THERE IS THE USUAL WESTERNIZED VIEW JOANA MEANS DARK WATER AND WAS USUALLY A BOY'S NAME THAT WASN'T THE NAME OF THE NAVIGATOR EITHER THE POLYNESIANS WEREN'T SAILING INTO AN UNKNOWN THEY WERE SAILING WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE THOUSANDS OF MILES TOWARDS WHAT THEY KNEW WAS MORE LAND TO THE EASTERN ONE REASON IS THEY CONSIDERED THE SHARK THEIR BROTHERS AND WERE KEENLY AWARE OF SHARK MIGRATION ROUTES IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT ONE SHARK MIGRATION ROUTE HAS BEEN FOUND FROM THE COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA TO THE TAHITI AREA AND THE TAHITIANS KNEW IT WELL THEY ALSO KNEW SEVERAL BIRD MIGRATION PATHS THE GOLDEN PLOVER TRAVELING SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES FROM ALASKA TO HAWAII EVERY WINTER FOR FEEDING AND MATING THE KAHUNA ALSO KNEW ABOUT THE MIGRATION PATHS OF THE WHALES THE KAHUNA KNEW THESE THINGS OVER YEARS AGO THE KAHUNA ALSO KNEW ABOUT INDIVIDUAL STARS AND THE ARCS THEY MADE IN THE NIGHT SKY IT SOUNDS LIKE THE DISNEY VERSION IS A STAB AT THE HAWAIIANS THEY STOPPED MIGRATING BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY HAD FOUND THE PLACE THEY WANTED TO BE THE TAHITIANS DIDN'T AND WENT ON TO APA NUI EASTER ISLAND AND PROBABLY FURTHER EAST AS DNA AND ARCHAEOLOGY IS NOW STARTING TO FIND THE DISNEY MESSAGE IS NOT THE MESSAGE OF THE LEGEND
MISLEADING VIDEO WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION WE WOULDN'T ALREADY KNOW

ALL SHE REALLY SAYS IS THAT BY THE EARLY WE WILL HAVE IT SORTED SO IT'S LIKE DR BRAND IN INTERSTELLAR I'LL SOLVE THE EQUATION BY THE TIME YOU GET BACK
IS THIS A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION OR A SCIENCE RELATED QUESTION TYPICALLY UP IS THE DIRECTION THAT IS OPPOSITE GRAVITY WHERE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT GRAVITATIONAL FORCES PRESENT OTHERWISE UP IS A RELATIVE TERM

NOW ENOUGH OF BEING A SMART ALECK UP EXCEPT MY CEILING AND ALPHA COUNTY SUP WITH YOU

PLEASE READ THE RULES FOR THIS SUB AND KEEP THINGS SPACE RELATED
UNFORTUNATELY MILKY WAY SEASON IS NOW OVER ALTHOUGH THE MILKY WAY IS ACTUALLY VISIBLE YEAR ROUND THE GALACTIC CORE IS BLOCKED BY THE SUN DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AS THE EARTH ROTATES AROUND IT THIS WAS ONE OF MY LAST MILKY WAY SHOTS OF THE YEAR TAKEN AT AN ABANDONED AIRSTRIP NEAR BON ECHO PROVINCIAL PARK IN ONTARIO CANADA

CAMERA SETTINGS NIKON SIGMA F F ISO EXPOSURE SHOTS TWO ROWS OF STICHEL IN MICROSOFT ICE

I HAVE MORE ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY ON MY INSTAGRAM FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED
COULD SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW WE ARE ABLE TO SEE OUR GALAXY SO CLEARLY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING INSIDE OF IT
HOW DO TAKE PERFECT PHOTOS OFF THE CELESTIAL NIGHT SKY LIKE THAT AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER HERE
THIS IS A SERIOUS QUESTION CAN YOU REALLY SEE ALL OF THIS WITH YOUR EYES I CAN'T FATHOM IT I LIVE IN NYC AND I AM EVEN BLOWN AWAY LOOKING AT THE STARS I CAN SEE
OR PUT AN OTHER WAY

IT'S OME TO LOOK OUT INTO THE REST UNIVERSE AGAIN

DOES IT LOOK LIKE THIS TO THE NAKED EYE THAT'S MY DREAM TO SEE THAT
BEAUTIFUL PICTURE I HOPE TO GET A NICE CAMERA SOON AND GET SOME GOOD SHOTS OF THIS NEXT SEASON
THE TITLE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO ANDROMEDA OR SOMETHING
PLEASE TELL ME I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS IT LOOKS LIKE A VAGINA
WE LIVE IN THE MILKY WAY SO EVERY STAR YOU SEE IN YOUR LIFE IS IN THE MILKY WAY
IT TOWERS PROUD AND TALL OVER THE BLACK BRUSH JUST LIKE MY PENIS
RETIRED NASA ENGINEER MANAGER HERE
NUMBER ANY ATTEMPT TO JETTISON THE WHILE STILL BURNING WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN VEHICLE DESTRUCTION TRYING TO JETTISON THE SHUTTLE FROM THE STACK WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN VEHICLE DESTRUCTION THE RTLS RETURN TO LAUNCH SITE ABORT DOESN'T KICK IN TILL T PLUS WITH OPS TRANSFERRING TO THE MAIN COMPUTING REPLACING OPS THE LAUNCH PROFILE
THIS ACCIDENT REALLY HIGHLIGHTED ONE OF THE BIG FATAL FLAWS IN THE SHUTTLE PROGRAM THE SOLID BOOSTERS ONCE THEY WERE LIT THERE WERE NO REALISTIC SURVIVABLE ABORT METHODS FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR BURN

IF THERE HAD BEEN A BIG ABORT WARNING THE MOMENT THEY'D LAUNCHED THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING TO SURVIVE SEPARATING FROM THE LAUNCH STACK WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE DOING SO WOULD MEAN THEY'D HAVE TO SHUT OFF THE MAIN ENGINES WHICH WERE FUELED FROM THE STACK WHICH WOULD CAUSE THE WHOLE THING TO ROTATE BECAUSE OF ASYMMETRIC THRUST CAUSING THE WHOLE STACK TO BE TORN APART BY AERODYNAMIC FORCES AND STRUCTURAL STRESSES IF THEY HAD JETTISONED THE ARBS DURING THEIR BURN THEN THE INCREDIBLY ABRASIVE BLAST OF THE SRB EXHAUST WOULD HAVE RIPPED THE FRAGILE ORBITER TO PIECES IT GOES ON THEY WERE DOOMED THE MOMENT THOSE BIG UNSTOPPABLE ROCKETS WERE LITERAL

THE DESIGNERS INVESTIGATED ADDING A THRUST TERMINATION SYSTEM THESE BLOW THE HEAD OFF THE SRB SO THEY JUST BURN WITHOUT HAVING DIRECTED THRUST TO THE ARBS ACCORDING TO DENNIS HISTORY OF THE SHUTTLE DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DISCOVERED IT WOULD REQUIRE STRENGTHENING THE FUSELAGE TO SURVIVE THE SUDDEN JERK AND THAT REINFORCEMENT WOULD HAVE ADDED A FEW TONS TO THE ORBITER
I THOUGHT THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT AT LEAST ONE OF THE CREW WAS ALIVE AFTER THE EXPLOSION AND ACTUALLY DIED WHEN THE CAPSULE HIT THE OCEAN
IF THEY HAD THE VIDEO TECHNOLOGY AND HIGH RESOLUTION CAPABILITIES THAT WE HAVE TODAY COULD THEY HAVE RECOGNIZED THIS WAS HAPPENING IN REAL TIME

ABSOLUTELY NOT VERY CAPTAIN HINDSIGHT LOGIC THERE AND THEY DIDN'T NEED HIGH EZ VIDEO BEFORE THE LAUNCH THE SRB ENGINEERS KNEW THAT COLD TEMPERATURES WERE CAUSING BURN THROUGH ON THE ARBS BEAUME THEY COULD SEE IT ON BOOSTERS RECOVERED AFTER THEY WERE FLOWN NASA AND MK MANAGEMENT DECIDED TO GO AHEAD ANYWAY

IF THEY HAD OUR HIGH RESOLUTION VIDEO AND COULD NOTICE THAT IT WAS HAPPENING COULD THEY HAVE ABORTED THE MISSION AND RETURNED THE CREW SAFELY

NO ONCE YOU LIGHT THOSE ARBS YOU'RE IN FOR A RIDE UNTIL THEY BURN OUT THERE WAS NO ABORT MODE WHILE THE SOLIDS WERE BURNING

IF THEY HAD NOTICED THE SMOKE IN THE FIRST SECONDS OF LAUNCH WOULD THEY HAVE CONTINUED THE LAUNCH IN ORDER TO PREVENT IT FROM EXPLODING ON THE LAUNCH PAD

SEE PREVIOUS ANSWER ONCE THE ARBS ARE LIT YOU'RE GOING PERIOD

IN GENERAL IS THERE ANYTHING WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS DISASTER

PRESSURE TO LAUNCH AKA LAUNCH FEVER IS VERY REAL AND VERY DANGEROUS WHEN THE ENGINEERS SAY THIS ISN'T SAFE IT IS INEXCUSABLE FOR MANAGEMENT TO SAY YEAH BUT WE'VE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT BEFORE SO IT'LL BE FINE

DO WE NOW HAVE BETTER LAUNCH ABORT PROCEDURES

VERTICAL STACK ROCKETS WITH CAPSULES HAVE LAUNCH ESCAPE ROCKETS TO BLOW THE CREW CAPSULE CLEAR OF AN EXPLODING VEHICLE UNLIKE WITH THE SHUTTLE WHERE THE ORBITER WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ENTIRE ASCENT STAGE AND COULDN'T SEPARATE WHILE THE ARBS WERE BURNING BECAUSE OF THE FORCES INVOLVED
GETTING INTO EARTH ORBIT THERE IS A LIST OF POINTS OF NO RETURN AND INERTIA AS WELL AS REACTION TIME ADD A TIME DISTANCE TO THEM WERE YOU CAN SEE A FATAL CATASTROPHE HAPPEN WITH NO WAY TO PREVENT ITS OUTCOME

OFTEN SAFETY BACKUP MEASURES OR SAFETY SYSTEMS ARE NOT WORTH THE ADDED MASS COST SOMETIMES THEY ARE

THIS RESULTS IN A LOT OF OPTIONS BEFORE POINTS OF NO RETURN AND A LOT OF LACK OF CHOICE SHORTLY AFTER YOU CROSS A THRESHOLD AND DEAL WITH CONSEQUENCES

HIGHER RESOLUTION LIFE VIDEO FEED ONLY MAKES POST ANALYSIS EASIER LIKE THE NEWER SHUTTLE THAT STARTS FROM A PLANE AND GOT THAT RIPPED APART IN SUPERSONIC BECAUSE THE WINGS WERE SET TOO STEEP
I READ AN ARTICLE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THAT MADE TWO KEY POINTS

THERE WAS NO EXPLOSION RATHER THE SHUTTLE BURNED UP AND THE CREW WAS LIKELY UNCONSCIOUS BUT DID NOT DIE UNTIL THEIR IMPACT WITH THE WATER BELOW THAT BEING SAID THE CREW WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAVE THEMSELVES FROM THEIR FATE AND WOULD HAVE ONLY SURVIVED IF AN AUTOMATIC AID WAS ARRAIGNED OR BUILT INTO THE SHUTTLE
THE SHUTTLE IN MANY WAYS WAS A FLAWED SYSTEM
ASYMMETRICAL THRUST DUE TO THE THAT MEANS YOU CANNOT JUST SHUT THE DOWN IN A PHASE OF HIGH ACCELLELERATION OR THE STACK WILL BREAK UP

ON A MANNED FLIGHT ONCE LIT THEY WILL BURN TILL THE END PROBABLY NOT POSSIBLE TO JETTISON THEM WITHOUT EXPLODING THE MAIN TANK TOO

USING A HUGE AND RELATIVELY FRAGILE ORBITER FOR BOTH CREW TRANSPORT AND PAYLOAD MUCH SMARTER TO USE SMALLER ROCKETS FOR THE ASTRONAUTS AND VEHICLES FOR CARGO

DUE TO THE DOUBLE-DECKED LAYOUT EJECTION SEATS WEREN'T POSSIBLE NOT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HELPED FOR THE CHALLENGER CREW ALSO IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD A LAUNCH ESCAPE SYSTEM LIKE APOLLO OR SOYUZ USED

LOOKS LIKE THIS IS WATER ICE

THE VIKING 2 LANDER AWOKE ONE MORNING TO FIND THAT IT WAS SURROUNDED BY A WHITE LANDSCAPE THE ICE SURROUNDING IT HAD FORMED WHEN THE OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURE DROPPED TO K F THE TEMPERATURE OF CARBON DIOXIDE ICE CRYSTALLIZATION BUT IT DIDN'T MELT AWAY AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES SCIENTISTS ASSUMED THAT THE WHITE FROST CONTAINED WATER ICE THAT FORMED ON CARBON DIOXIDE ICE SEED CRYSTALS

HOLY SHIT I LOVE THIS IMAGE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOW ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MARS ROVER IMAGES
CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN WHY THERE IS A BLACK BOX IN THE TOP RIGHT CORNER LIKE IS THERE SOMETHING THAT NASA DOES NOT WANT US TO SEE
I'M AFRAID THE FLIGHT MECHANICS AREN'T AT ALL REALISTIC BUT IT'S STILL A COOL GAME IF YOU WANT REALISTIC SPACEFLIGHT YOUR BEST BETS ARE HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM OR ORBITER ORBITER IS A MORE HARDCORE SIMULATOR
AND IF YOU WANT THE MILKY WAY AND EVERY OTHER GALAXY FOR FREE WITHOUT THE PESKY SPACESHIPS GET SPACEENGINE
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR ANDROID EXPLORE THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT THE COMBAT CRAP
OK WE'VE GOT A FEW PEOPLE KNOCKING THIS GAME LET'S BE CLEAR ELITE DANGEROUS IS A FUTURISTIC SIMULATION OF TRAVEL WITHIN THE ENTIRE MILKY WAY THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE SUPERLUMINAL VELOCITIES ON TOP OF LOTS OF SPACECRAFT FUNCTIONS THAT YOU CAN'T MANUALLY OVERRIDE


IT IS A PRETTY DECENT SIMULATION AND THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN PLAYING HARDCORE FLIGHT SIMS FOR ALMOST YEARS THE GAME DOES LET YOU CONTROL YOUR SPACECRAFT MANUALLY REQUIRING A TO STOP ROTATION FOR EXAMPLE HOWEVER THE FLIGHT COMPUTER IS STILL ENGAGED AND WILL PREVENT YOU FROM EXCEEDING THE MAX OF YOUR CRAFT


IF YOU WANT A SIMULATOR WITH EXPLORATION DOCKING COMMODITY TRADING AND EXPLORATION THAT'S SET IN A FUTURISTIC S TIMELINE ELITE DANGEROUS IS EXCELLENT AND IT'S MULTIPLAYER AND IT'S GETTING REGULAR UPDATES

THE AUTHOR IS USING A STRAW MAN ARGUMENT HERE MUSK NEVER CLAIMED THAT ROCKETRY FOLLOWS LAW HE'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR THAT FOR THE MOST PART SPACE PLANS TO USE PROVEN TECHNOLOGY IN MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO MAKE ROCKETS REUSABLE

THE MAIN TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT THE MARS SPACECRAFT REQUIRE ARE ENGINES AND CARBON COMPOSITE TANKS THEY'RE ENGINEERING CHALLENGES RATHER THAN SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS AND BOTH ARE ALREADY IN PHYSICAL PROTOTYPE STAGE
ROCKETRY DIDN'T HAVE 2 WORLD WARS TO ADVANCE AT LIGHTNING SPEED LIKE AVIATION DID THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO FORGET THAT WHILE THE PHYSICS IS WELL UNDERSTOOD IT STILL LEAVE HUGE AREA OF IMPROVEMENT EVERYWHERE THE PHYSICS OF AVIATION DIDN'T CHANGE YET YOU CAN TRAVEL ALL AROUND EUROPE FOR LESS THAN A EURO AVIATION DIDN'T FOLLOW A MOORE LAW CURVE JUST PLAIN OLD ECONOMY OF SCALE AND HUGE AMOUNT OF ITERATION OF THE SAME UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY WHERE TURBOFAN IT IS NOT THERE YET WE HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED WE ARE USING THE SAME PLAIN OLD TECHNOLOGY WE USED TO GO TO THE MOON SPACE X AIM TO CHANGE THAT

EXPONENTIAL IS BY DEFINITION NOT AN S-CURVE

NOTHING EVER GOES EXPONENTIALLY FOREVER EXCEPT MAYBE THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE

THE COMPARISON WITH LAW IS REALLY WEAK I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE AUTHOR INSISTS SO MUCH ON IT I AGREE WITH THE LAST PART OF THE ARTICLE THOUGH

VISION WITHOUT FUNDING IS HALLUCINATION MARS IS NOT A HOW PROBLEM IT IS A WHY PROBLEM I GROW WEARY OF PRETTY PICTURES OF ROCKETS MUSK HAS DONE THE EASY PART OF SKETCHING THE OBVIOUS DESTINATION THE HARD PART IS WHY WHY PAY FOR IT AND THAT HAS BEEN ON HOLD FOR DECADES MUSK S ROCKET BLUEPRINTS PUT US NO CLOSER TODAY THAN WE WERE HALF A CENTURY AGO

LIFE IS INCREDIBLY SIGNIFICANT THE ONLY THING MORE PROFOUND THAN DISCOVERING LIFE WOULD BE DISCOVERING THAT WE ARE ALONE

DISCOVERING NEW LIFE MEANS DISCOVERING NEW MATERIALS NEW SCIENCE NEW UNDERSTANDING AND PERHAPS NEW TECHNOLOGY
OP THIS LOOKS AS A VERY DEEP AND WISE SENTENCE BUT IN FACT IT MEANS NOTHING UNLESS YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF THIS MORE SIGNIFICANT
HUMANS ONLY HAVE SENSES AND WITH RADIO TELESCOPES AND PROBES A FEW MORE TOOLS OF OBSERVATION A LOT OF WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT COULD BE ALL AROUND US AND WE WOULD NEVER KNOW LIFE MAY NOT BE THE POINT OF THE UNIVERSE ONLY ANOTHER FUNCTION OF IT OUR LIVES ARE SO SHORT COMPARED TO THE UNIVERSE WE SEEM TO BE VERY TEMPORARY AS INDIVIDUALS HOWEVER HUMANS AS A COLLECTIVE THROUGH OUT HISTORY MAY SERVE A PURPOSE THAT WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T UNDERSTAND SADLY IT MIGHT NOT BE A REQUIREMENT AND WE MAY VERY WELL NEVER KNOW
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN MUCH LIKE A ROCK COULDN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND A TREE BEING ALIVE AND A TREE MAY HAVE NO CONCEPT OF INTELLIGENT LIFE HUMANS CAN ONLY CONCEIVE THINGS THAT MAKE SENSE TO THEM A SMALL ANIMAL IS LIKELY CLUELESS TO THE USE AND EXISTENCE OF HUMAN AIRCRAFT EVEN IF THEY SEE THEM DAILY THEY CAN'T CONCEIVE THEIR USAGE BECAUSE IT'S OUTSIDE OF THEIR UNDERSTANDING IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS PERVADES US THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE BUT AS OF NOW LIFE IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING WE CAN GRASP THE ONLY OTHER THING I CAN IMAGINE ROCKING THE BOAT AS HARD IS ANSWERING WHY OR HOW THE UNIVERSE EXISTS OR WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS

I AM A BOTANY FAQ CODE
A STAR WITHOUT FUSION TURNS INTO A WHITE DWARF NEUTRON STAR OR BLACK HOLE DEPENDING ON ITS MASSACHUSETTS OUR SUN WOULD WIND UP AS A WHITE DWARF THEY'RE SURPRISINGLY SMALL A WHITE DWARF IS ONLY ABOUT THE SIZE OF EARTH NEUTRON STARS ARE ABOUT ACROSS AND BLACK HOLES CAN BE EVEN SMALLER THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR GRAVITY IS STRONG ENOUGH TO COMPACT THEMSELVES INTO EXOTIC FORMS OF MATTER NOT FOUND ON REGULAR PLANETS
PARDON ME BUT THIS IS A NONSENSICAL QUESTION THE SUN IS A BALANCE BETWEEN LIGHT PRESSURE AND GRAVITATIONAL CONTRACTION THIS QUESTION WOULD BE THE SAME AS ASKING HOW TALL IS FREEDOM TOWER WITHOUT A STRUCTURE OR HOW HOT IS FIRE IF IT DIDN'T BURN WHILE IT WOULD NOT COLLAPSE TO A WHITE DWARF OR NEUTRON STAR AS SOME HAVE SAID I WILL ENTERTAIN YOU

LET'S ROUND THE SUN'S MASS TO G NOW SINCE THE SUN IS H HE WE'LL ASSUME IT IS MADE OF HYDROGEN THE BOHR RADIUS OF HYDROGEN IS CM ALL OF THIS WILL COME IN HANDY

MOL ATOMS WHICH WITH H MEANS GRAM IS ATOMS NOW THE SUN IS GRAMS SO THE SUN CONTAINS GRAMS ATOMS ATOMS NOW CONSIDER THE ATOMIC RADIUS LISTED ABOVE CM THIS MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF ATOMS YIELDS CM OR AU

DO YOU SEE WHY THIS IS NONSENSICAL

I HAVE ASSUMED THE RADIUS IS THE BOHR RADIUS WHICH DISREGARDING EVERYTHING IS A DECENT APPROXIMATION WE HAVE NEGLECTED SOME VERY IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT THE SUN

THE CORE IS G CM

2 THE INTERIOR OF THE SUN IS MOSTLY IF NOT ENTIRELY IONIZED MEANING THE RADIUS OF THE ELECTRON DOES NOT APPLY SO THE FORCES IN THE SUN CANNOT BE CONSIDERED CLASSICALLY

TO ILLUSTRATE THIS I'LL ATTACH A PLOT I MADE FROM A SIMULATION RUN OF A SOLAR MASS STAR WHILE THE MASS IS MUCH LARGER HOPEFULLY THE POINT WILL BE CONVEYED THIS IS WHAT'S KNOWS AS A T RHO PROFILE IT SHOWS THE CENTRAL TEMPERATURE VS CENTRAL DENSITY OF A STAR WHEN IN A LOG SCALE WE EXPECT SOMETHING LIKE A LINEAR RELATION POWER LAW WHICH IS FOR THE MOST PART WHAT YOU SEE HERE

A EYSK

NOW SINCE THIS IS A LOG SCALE CONSIDER WHAT THE EXTREME RIGHT END OF THE PLOT MEANS WHEN THE STAR IS G CM THE CENTRAL TEMP IS K OR BILLION DEGREES COMPARE THIS TO THE SUN WHOSE CENTRAL TEMP IS CURRENTLY MILLION KING HOWEVER THE SUN IS THOUGHT TO OBEY THIS POWER LAW

THIS IS ALL WHY YOU CAN'T CONSIDER THE SUN WITHOUT FIRE
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT LESS THAN OF THE SUN IS COMPRISED OF VARIOUS METALS BUT FOR THE REST IT'S ALL HYDROGEN AND HELIUM I'M NOT SURE WHERE YOU GOT THAT FROM BUT IT MADE ME REMEMBER A HEATED ARGUMENT WITH MY GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS A MUSLIM AND HOW I TRIED TO CONVINCE HER THAT THE SUN WASN'T A PLANET AND WASN'T SOLID HER VIEW OF THE WORLD WAS EXTREMELY NARROW AND BIASED AND SHE KEPT YELLING AT ME THAT IT WAS MADE OF LAVA AND ROCK AND THAT I WAS DELUDED FOR THINKING OTHERWISE

YOUR INABILITY TO DO A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH MADE ME REMEMBER THAT
THE SYNCHRONIZED WAY THEY FALL OFF IS REALLY REMARKABLE ALL THAT FORCE AND STILL SUCH FINE PRECISION

NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE KOLAROV CROSS WHICH IS A LOW HARD SHOT ACROSS THE FACE OF GOAL
KOROLEV WAS SUCH A GENIUS WITH SUCH A HORRIBLE FATE HE WAS SENT TO GULAG SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE ACCUSATION OF A COMPETITOR THAT HE WAS PLOTTING TO KILL STALIN AND HAD TO DO SLAVE LABOUR HE WAS TORTURED ALMOST DIED DURING THIS SENTENCE AND HE SUFFERED SUCH BLOWS TO HIS HEALTH THAT HE WOULD EVENTUALLY DIE FROM THE AFTERMATH

HE WAS BASICALLY THE ONLY REASON THE SOVIET SPACE PROGRAM WORKED AND WAS AHEAD OF THE AMERICANS THE USSR AND ITS DISGUSTING AUTHORITARIAN REGIME SIMPLY DID NOT DESERVE SUCH A GREAT MIND
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY THE TIPS OF THE BOOSTERS STEAM UP SMOKE

IF ANYONE WANTS TO LEARN ABOUT KOROLEV AND THE EARLY SPACE RACE MATTHEW BRAZINSKYS BOOK RED MOON RISING IS GREAT
LIVED IN A CITY DEDICATED TO HIM AMA I GUESS RIGHT OUTSIDE MY HOUSE WAS A MASSIVE MODEL PROBE
WHERE DO THE BOOSTERS GO AFTER SEPARATING FROM THE ROCKET DO THEY FALL BACK TO EARTH OR STAY LOCKED WITHIN GRAVITY AND IS IN CONSTANT FREE FALL
ARE THEY REUSABLE DO THEY HAVE A LITTLE PARACHUTE LIKE THE HOME USE ONES
CAMERA POINTED RETROGRADE THERE LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A DANGLING PIECE OF WIRE ON CAMERAS LEFT LOWER IN THE BLACK PART OF SPACECRAFT OR IS THAT A REFLECTION OF THE BOOSTER FALLING AWAY
DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW THIS WORKS EXACTLY I'M ASSUMING THERE IS A PRESSURIZED AIR CANISTER AT THE TOP RELEASED BY A TIMES VALVE TO GIVE EACH ROCKET A MOMENT AWAY FROM THE BODY
THAT IS COOL THIS ALSO MADE ME REALIZE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE SOVIET'S SPACE PROGRAM
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THING IS MOVING AT S AT LEO ORBITAL VELOCITY IS KM SOUTH
THE GUY WAS THE SOVIET SPACE PROGRAM AND HIS STORY IS SUPER TRAGIC
IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN I WOULD JUMP OFF OF YOSHI ON LONG JUMP IN MARIO
BONUS POINTS IF SOMEONE CAN TELL ME WHY THE TOP OF THE ROCKET LOOKS BIGGER THAN THE BOTTOM IN THE FIRST SHOT MY BRAIN THINKS IT'S INVERTED IN SHOTS LIKE THESE
BIZARRE THE NAME KOROLEV SEPARATED BY ONLY THE LETTER U IN FIJI THERE IS A PLACE CALLED KOROLEVU MEANING EITHER BIG ROCK OR BIG VILLAGE

IS THE FACT THAT THIS MACHINE WAS DESIGNED TO VISIT BIG ROCKS TO CREATE BIG VILLAGES COINCIDENCE I THINK NOT
AND AS ALL US KERBALNAUTS KNOW YOU DON'T WANNA MESS UP YOUR BOOSTER EJECTION PHASES ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE MOUNTED RADIALLY
I AM KIND OF SURPRISED KURT MAGNUS DOES NOT HAVE A WIKIPEDIA PAGE IN ENGLISH YET
MY QUESTION THE SPEED BEFORE THE BOOSTERS ARE SEPARATED IS SOUTH BUT THE ALTITUDE IS NOT INCREASING AS PER THE SPEED MAYBE IT'S ON A CERTAIN ANGLE MOREOVER NOT IS THE DISTANCE TRAVELLED IS CHANGING ACCORDING TO THE SPEED NOW WHEN THE CAMERA CHANGES BOOSTERS ARE DROPPED OFF THE SPEED DRAMATICALLY DECREASES TO KM SOUTH IS THAT CORRECT READING
WHEN YOU SEE THE BOOSTERS EJECT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE TIPS OF THE BOOSTERS ARE THEY DUMPING ANY LEFTOVER FUEL OR WASTE BY PRODUCTS OR ARE THOSE ANOTHER SET OF BOOSTERS STARTING UP TO ASSIST WITH COMING BACK DOWN
I WISH MY BOOSTERS WOULD SEPARATE THIS WELL IN ESP ABOUT A THIRD OF THE TIME THEY END UP CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER OR TAKING OUT MY CORE STAGE
SAD FACT KOROLEV BARELY DIED IN THE GULAG LABOUR CAMP IN
YEARS LATER WHEN DOCTORS TRIED TO SAVE HIS LIFE THEY COULDN'T PROPERLY PROVIDE HIM AN INTUBATION BECAUSE HIS JAWS BROKEN DURING INTERROGATION IN THE GULAG
DIDNT KORALIE END UP GOING UP ON A SOYUZ FLIGHT THAT GOT BOTCHED UP ON RE-ENTRY AND THEY GAVE HIM A STATE FUNERAL WHERE HIS BODY BASICALLY LOOKED LIKE A POT ROAST IN A CASKET
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED THIS BUT HOW WILL THEY KNOW WHERE THOSE ROCKET PIECES WILL END UP FALLING
LIKE WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THEM FALLING ON TOP OF A CAR OR PERSON
SO WHERE WOULD THOSE FOUR PIECES END UP LANDING DOES ANYBODY CALCULATE FOR THAT IT'S PROBABLY A LOT LESS DANGEROUS THAN I THINK I'M JUST CURIOUS

YES ONCE THEY FALL OUT OF THE SKY A SPACE TROOPS UNIT IS DISPATCHED TO BLOW UP THEN SCRAP AND HAUL THEM BACK TO BASE HIGH-TEST PEROXIDE IS UNPREDICTABLE
THIS MIGHT BE A STUPID QUESTION BUT HOW DO THEY MAKE SURE THESE FOUR BOOSTERS DON'T HIT SOMEONE OR AN ANIMAL OR A BOAT OR A PLANE OR A BUILDING
WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM FALLING BACK DOWN TO EARTH AND HITTING A DOG OR SOMETHING
JUST IMAGINE IF ALL OF THOSE STAGE ROCKETS WERE REUSABLE LIKE THE FALCON S THAT WOULD LOOK SO COOL
I JUST REALIZED THOSE EACH LOOK LIKE THE SOVIET ROCKET TORPEDO
WIKI VA

SPACE MINING WILL BE COSTLY CHALLENGING AND POSSIBLE BUT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE MIGHT LIE IN A TREATY OVER WHO OWNS THE MOON
A STEALTH HUBBLE TELESCOPE CALLED MISTY WAS LAUNCHED ON FEBRUARY ON STS IT WAS NOT POINTED AT SPACE INSTEAD IT WAS POINTED AT THE EARTH
THIS IS WHY I LIKE SOLID ROCKET LAUNCHES BETTER INTENSE EXHAUST PLUMES
THAT'S A PRETTY INTENSE ANGLE SOON AFTER LAUNCH I WONDER IF THAT IS INDICATIVE OF HUBBLE BEING PLACED AT THE OUTER LIMITS OF THE SERVICE CEILING
IF WE COULD SURVIVE THE NEW CONDITIONS ON MARS THEN THE PLANET MAY ALSO SUSTAIN PARASITES VIRUSES AND BACTERIA THAT CAUSE DISEASE HOWEVER THE CHANGE IN AIR AND DENSITY MAY HAVE SOME PROTECTIVE PROPERTIES
ARE LEAST DISEASES THAT REQUIRE OTHER ANIMALS AS VECTORS WOULD BE ERADICATED SUCH AS DENGUE YELLOW FEVER ZIKA MALARIA SCHISTOSOMIASIS RABIES LEPTOSPIROSIS LYME WEST NILE ETC

EVEN IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT SAY SOMEONE BRINGS A VASE WITH DRY MOSQUITO EGGS SOME CAN SURVIVE FOR MONTHS WHICH HATCHES ON ARRIVAL THE CLOSED CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT IN THE COLONIES WOULD MAKE IT EASY TO PREVENT THEM TO MULTIPLY

DISEASES CARRIED AND TRANSMITTED BY HUMANS WOULD BE ANOTHER STORY AS YOU SAID EVENTUALLY SOMEONE WOULD CARY THEM TO MARS AND AS IT ALREADY HAPPENS ON EARTH THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE GRIM BECAUSE EARTHLINGS AND MARTIANS COULD END UP WITH RESISTANCE TO DIFFERENT STRAINS OF A VIRUS NOT BEING EXPOSED TO ITS GRADUAL MUTATIONS OVER TIME


I HAVE A FEELING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO A YEARLY WOULD BE SETUP BUT IT WOULD BE AT A DIFFERENT RATE AND FOR A LOT MORE DISEASES WE AREN'T GONNA DROP OFF A TON OF PEOPLE THERE AND THEN NOT COME BACK FOR A LONG TIME THINGS ARE PROBABLY GONNA BE VERY ACTIVE BETWEEN PLANETS ONCE IT GETS GOING SO I DON'T THINK THINGS WILL CHANGE MUCH
THE COMMON COLD EXISTS BECAUSE WE KEEP PASSING IT ON IF WE COULD ALL BE ISOLATED FOR A MONTH ON EARTH THEN SO I READ THE COLD WOULD DIE OFFICIAL BUT THAT NOT POSSIBLE FOR PRACTICAL REASONS

BUT IF NOBODY GOING TO MARS HAD A COLD OR THOSE GERMS THEN SURELY THERE WOULD BE NO COLDS ON MARS

EDIT BIT DRUNK JUST MOSTLY GUESSING HERE
THE RINGS OF SATURN ARE SO PROMINENT EVEN GALILEO COULD SEE THEM WITH BY STANDARDS A VERY LOW-QUALITY TELESCOPE HE DESCRIBED THE PLANET AS HAVING EARS IN
FORGET HIGH POWER SCOPES ESSENTIALLY ANY TELESCOPE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE OUT RINGS FAIRLY CLEARLY MY ORION DOBSONIAN MOUNTED REFLECTOR TELESCOPE ABOUT BUCKS CAN NOT ONLY EASILY MAKE OUT THE RINGS OF SATURN BUT I CAN ALSO MAKE OUT THE CASSINI DIVISION WITH THE HIGHER POWERED EYE PIECES ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE TIMES EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ON THE ORDER OF YEARS WHERE THE VIEW OF SATURN FROM EARTH IS SUCH THAT THE RINGS ARE VIEWED AND ONLY IN THAT CASE ARE THEY ESSENTIALLY INVISIBLE LAST TIME I CHECKED IT LOOKED LIKE WE HAD A GOOD ANGLE OF VIEWING THOUGH
YES YOU CAN SEE THEM DIRECTLY WITH A TELESCOPE IN REAL TIME NO LONG EXPOSURES OR ENHANCEMENT BEYOND MAGNIFICATION NEEDED
MY TELESCOPE WAS CHEAPER THAN THAT AND I SAW THE RINGS FROM MY BACKYARD IN THE BURBS OF SOCAL ALSO THE MOONS OF JUPITER
DELETED
THAT IS INDEED A VALID APPROACH LOTS OF MISSIONS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED WITH THIS IN MIND UNFORTUNATELY NONE OF THEM HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN EXECUTED

THIS ONE IS GOOD EXAMPLE THE BIG TANK IN THE BACK IS PUSHING ANOTHER FUEL TANK AN ORION AND SOME CREW MODULES OUT OF GRAVITY WELL THE WHOLE THING WOULD BE ASSEMBLED IN EARTH ORBIT OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU'RE STILL LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT OF FUEL AND THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ENGINES YOU CAN BRING THAT IS WHY A LONG STRING OF MODULES PUSHED BY A SMALL ENGINE WILL BE UNLIKELY
DELETED
WHILE THIS IS AN OBVIOUS AND VALID APPROACH I SEE TWO PROBLEMS WITH IT FIRST ONE IS THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE WHOLE SYSTEM WORKABLE YOU NEED A MORE ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING NUCLEAR WHICH MEANS DECADES OF WORK AND THE POLITICAL WILL DOESN'T LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR THAT THEN THERE IS THE FACT THAT IT'S MUCH EASIER TO LAND ON EARTH MARS THAN TO FIRST SETTLE INTO ORBIT AND THEN LAND AT THAT POINT IT WOULD BE THE THRUSTER INTERPLANETARY PROPULSION BUS BEING SLOWED INTO ORBIT THAT ACTS AS DEAD MASSACHUSETTS
BECAUSE WE HAVE PLENTY OF PLACES ON EARTH THAT ARE STILL UNEXPLORED AND WHAT WOULD WE TAKE TO MARS A PLAQUE SAYING WE DUMPED OUR SHIT HERE FIRST BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME RUSSIA
WE HAVE LAUNCHED SPACE CRAFT OFF THE SURFACE OF THE MOON THE LUNAR MODULES OF APOLLO AND AND LUNA AND

UNLESS SOMETHING IS BUILT ON THE MOON IT WOULD NEED TO BE LAUNCHED FROM EARTH LAND ON THE MOON AND TAKE OFF AGAIN WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE
YOU HAVE TO GET THERE FIRST WHY LAND THERE THEN TAKE OFF AGAIN

IT'S A LOT HARDER TO GET OFF THE EARTH WHICH IS STILL NECESSARY
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S BECAUSE WE'D HAVE TO LAND ANY FUEL WE'D NEED THERE FIRST AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE TRANSPORTED FROM EARTH THUS MAKING IT UNNECESSARY
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN YOU REALLY GOOD EXPLANATIONS AS TO WHY WE HAVE NOT DONE IT YET

THAT BEING SAID I THINK I DO REMEMBER OF THAT VERY REASON BEING ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR ESTABLISHING A LUNAR BASE IT WOULD BE A STOPPING POINT FOR MISSIONS SUCH AS THE PROPOSED UPCOMING MANNED MISSION TO MARS
YES IT IS INDEED ALREADY IN THE AIR

FOR VOYAGES THE MOON WOULD BE THE BEST BASE AT THE FRACTION OF COSTS

THIS MEANS TO BUILD SPACECRAFT ON THE MOON AND THE LUNAR ORBIT IDEM FOR PRODUCTION OF ROCKET FUEL

AND WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY INDEED NASA SCIENTIST CLAIMS SPACE MINING IS POSSIBLE WITH TODAY S TECH
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD ALREADY DONE THIS EITHER IT'S A GOOD IDEA THOUGH YOU SHOULD BE AN ASTRONAUTICS LOL
PARAGRAPHS EXIST AND SO DOES SCIENCE MIGHT WANT TO BONE UP ON IT
COULD YOU PLEASE LINK SOME EVIDENCE OF THIS SOME PARAGRAPHS WOULD ALSO BE NICE
NEAT CONCEPT I'D NOT SEEN MUCH ABOUT LUNE BEFORE BEYOND THE SPACECRAFT PORTION AND DID SOME MORE DIGGING I WONDER HOW THIS WOULD HAVE WORKED IN PRACTICE THOUGH ESPECIALLY WITH THE A VARIANTS LOOKS PRETTY SIMILAR TO PROPOSALS FOR BASED LAUNCHERS LATER ON IN APOLLO WHICH ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PROGRESS BECAUSE OF MASSIVE G OVERLOADING WHICH WOULD HAVE RIPPED THEM APART AND MASS OVERRUNS FROM STRUCTURAL REINFORCEMENT NEEDED REALLY THE A SERIES AS A WHOLE SEEMS KINDA UNNECESSARY THEY'D NEED TO DEVELOP ANOTHER SRB AND A NEW VARIANT OF THE A CORE WITH BOOSTER ATTACH POINTS AND ITS PAYLOAD CAPACITY WAS LOWER THAN THE TITAN IDIC THAT EXISTED AROUND THAT TIME PERIOD AND THE LARGER SRB VERSION ALSO SEEMS LIKE A WASTED DEVELOPMENT ITS MASS FOR THE VARIANT WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE BUT WITH A LOWER ESP AND WIDER LESS AERODYNAMIC AND THE VARIANT WAS LESS POWERFUL THAN THE IDEA OF A SPACEPLANE FOR LUNAR MISSIONS IS KINDA COOL BUT ON THE LAUNCH VEHICLE SIDE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY COULD HAVE SAVED A BOATLOAD OF MONEY ON DEVELOPMENT AND ACTUALLY ENDED UP WITH MORE CAPABLE LAUNCHERS BY USING PARTS THAT ALREADY EXISTED WOULD EXIST WITHIN 2 OR YEARS
DANG THAT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS ALREADY I WAS WATCHING WHEN THEY FIRST TRIED TO INFLATE IT
PROBABLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE NEXT SPACE STATION WILL BE MADE OF THESE MODULES AND IF THE MOON BASE PLAN GOES AHEAD PROBABLY TOO

SO TECHNOLOGY WORKS TOO BAD THERE'S STILL NO BUSINESS MODEL FOR IT
UM THAT DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT AT THE END IS THE MOON ABOUT TO SUCKER PUNCH MARS
THIS LOOKS NICE BUT IVE ALWAYS DISLIKED SCALES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM THE BEAUTY OF SPACE IS THE VAST DISTANCES AND THE HUGE MASSES OF PLANETS THAT SCATTER THAT SPACE

KIND OF RUINS IT WHEN THE EARTH IS THE SIZE OF THE SUN AND SKIMMING MARS
I DID SOME DETECTIVE WORK TO TRY AND TRACK THE ORIGINAL DOWN I ENDED UP AT A COMPANY CALLED DYNAMIC DIAGRAMS AND THEIR WEBSITE WHICH SEEMS TO BE MOSTLY DERELICT NOW

READ THEIR ORINIGINAL POST AT THE INTERNET ARCHIVE

I PUT A COPY UP ON GITHUB FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES TO THE EXPERIENCE

DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE POSITIONS OF THE VARIOUS CELESTIAL BODIES ARE ACTUALLY ACCURATE
IF THE IMAGE WAS ACTUALLY TO SCALE IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS HETP A PURE BLACK VOID NOTHING ELSE WILL BE VISIBLE

THE ORBIT OF URANUS IS ABOUT BILLION KILOMETERS WIDE WHILE IN THE PICTURE IT'S ABOUT PIXELS THAT'S MORE THAN MILLION KILOMETERS PER PIXEL AND THAT MEANS THAT THE SUN IS LESS THAN PIXELS WIDE AND THE SIZE OF EARTH IS LESS THAN PIXELS
IT'S NOT TO SCALE AS YOU TELL BECAUSE ALL THE PLANETARY ORBITS ARE SHOWN TO BE SEPARATED BY SIMILAR DISTANCES AND ARE SHOWN AS BEING PERFECTLY CIRCULAR WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY ELLIPTICAL

I'M GUESSING THAT THE ORBITAL PERIODS ARE ROUGHLY CORRECT SINCE OTHERWISE THE PICTURE IS PRETTY USELESS

WHY IS THE EARTH SO MUCH BIGGER THAN VENUS THEY'RE BASICALLY THE SAME SIZE LAST TIME I CHECKED
THERE'S THIS GREAT APP FOR IOS WHICH HAS A VIEW VERY SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE
IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOW SLOW THE OUTER PLANETS REVOLVE AROUND THE SUN

I AM A BOTANY FAQ CODE
YOUR MISSING PLANET AND THE KUIPER BELT SCATTERED DISK AND DETACHED OBJECTS DID WE SEND NEW HORIZONS OUT TO THE FAR REACHES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM FOR NOTHING
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE TRADE-OFF WITH VISUALIZATION AND SIMULATION THAT IS WHAT IS AT THE HEART OF THIS REAL FAKE PERCEPTION PROBLEM THAT IS GOING ON NOT BEING ABLE TO DISCERN WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ARTISTIC AND DATA VISUALIZATION AND SIMULATION SCALE AND TIME VARIABLES ARE HIGHLY EXAGGERATED BUT THE VISUALIZATION IS ONLY REPRESENTING ACQUIRED DATA IT IS INTERESTING TO KNOW THE ASTEROID BELT IS ALSO REVOLVING ABOUT THE SUN I ALWAYS VISUALIZED THEM AS BEING STATIC ALSO DIDN'T REALIZE THE PLUTO YEAR WAS SO FAST EARTH IS SUPER EXAGGERATED SINCE THIS IS DEPICTING ONE EARTH REVOLUTION AROUND THE SUN ONE EARTH YEAR REFERENCE
AW YES NOT EVEN THE SOLAR SYSTEM COULD EVADE THE MASS RAMPANT COCAINE CARTEL IN THE SOUTH
YOU'RE OVERSIMPLIFYING A LOT OF THINGS THERE AND HAVE A BASIC MISUNDERSTANDING OF VARIOUS FIELDS OF SCIENCES THERE

STATE OF MATTER DEPENDS ON THE STRENGTH OF INTERMOLECULAR FORCES ATOMS AND MOLECULES HAVE VARIOUS FORCES THAT PULL THEM CLOSER TO EACH OTHER TEMPERATURE JUST TELLS HOW FAST THEY'RE GOING HOW EASILY THEY OVERCOME THESE LITTLE PULLS BETWEEN EACH OTHER WHEN THE FORCES ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE MOLECULES AND ATOMS IN A SHAPE THEN THAT'S A SOLID WHEN THEY'RE STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM TOGETHER BUT NOT IN A SHAPE THAT'S A LIQUID WHEN THEY'RE JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD TOGETHER THAT'S A GAS

SPACE DOESN'T HAVE A TEMPERATURE WHEN THEY SAY SPACE HAS A CERTAIN TEMPERATURE OF X KELVIN THAT MEANS THE TEMPERATURE OF AN OBJECT WILL RADIATE HEAT UNTIL IT HITS X KELVIN AT WHICH POINT BACKGROUND RADIATION WILL REACH EQUILIBRIUM WITH THE OBJECT'S OWN RADIATION KEEPING IT FROM FALLING ANY FURTHER

YOU'VE GOT A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE WHOLE OXYGEN ON EARTH THING OXYGEN IS ALL OVER THE PLACE IT WAS THERE BEFORE LIFE EXISTED ON EARTH ALL THAT BACTERIA DID WAS EVOLVE A PROCESS THAT BREAKS THE OXYGEN OFF OF OTHER COMPOUNDS THEY CAN'T SIMPLY EAT ONE ELEMENT AND RELEASE ANOTHER THAT WOULD BE A NUCLEAR PROCESS AND LIFE ONLY DOES CHEMICAL PROCESSES BACTERIA JUST LIBERATED OXYGEN FROM WATER AND SULFUR COMPOUNDS FREEING IT TO BE IN THE ATMOSPHERE

NO SHIT EVERYTHING HAS HYDROGEN IN IT HYDROGEN IS JUST A PROTON AND AN ELECTRON IT'S THE SIMPLEST ELEMENT THERE IS AND COMPOSES MOST OF OUR UNIVERSE IT WAS THE FIRST ELEMENT CREATED AFTER THE BIG BANG HYDROGEN IS THE VERY FIRST ELEMENT ON THE PERIODIC TABLE THE ONLY REASON ANYTHING OTHER THAN HYDROGEN EXISTS AT ALL IS BECAUSE GRAVITY CLUMPED IT UP AND FUSED IT TO MAKE ALL THOSE OTHER ELEMENTS

NOT SURE IF THEORY WOULD WORK SINCE WITHOUT THE OZONE LAYER THE EARTH IS TRAVELING AT THE SPEED OF SUPER FUCKING FAST THE ATOMS WOULD HAVE TO OF STUCK TO EARTH LIKE GLUE NOT TO BE SUCKED OUT FROM SPACE S VACUUM

EVEN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS CHEMISTRY AND METEOROLOGY HERE

VACUUMS DON'T SUCK ANYTHING PRESSURE ONLY PUSHES THINGS AWAY AND VACUUM IS THE LACK OF THAT PUSHING ATMOSPHERE IS JUST AN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE PULLING OF GRAVITY AND THE PUSHING OF GASSES AGAINST THEMSELVES THE SPEED OF EARTH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THE EARTH TO PULL AWAY THE ATMOSPHERE OR RESIST THAT MOVEMENT

THE OZONE LAYER HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A SINGLE THING YOU TALKED ABOUT IT'S JUST A REGION IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE IS MORE COMMON THAN ANYWHERE ELSE THANKS TO UV LIGHT LETTING IT FOR MORE EASILY IT JUST BLOCKS SOME UV LIGHT FROM HITTING THE PLANET'S SURFACE THAT'S ALL
YOU MIGHT FIND THIS INTERESTING IT'S BEEN DOING THE ROUNDS HERE THE LAST MONTH OR SO ALTHOUGH I CAN'T FIND A MORE SCIENTIFIC VERSION




THE MILLION SCHIAPARELLI HAD TRAVELLED FOR SEVEN YEARS

WHAT
NOVEMBER AT BAIKONUR WAS COLD THEREFORE THE CREW MANNED SPACECRAFT SOYUZ MS OLEG NOVITSKY PEGGY WHITSON AND TENSE PERQUEST DECIDED BEFORE THE START TO WEAR HEATPROOF SUITS WHICH ARE INFORMALLY CALLED THE WHITE BEAR COSTUMES MAKE AT MOSCOW NPP ZVEZDA WHERE HE CREATED ALL THE SPACE GEAR FLIGHT SUITS SOKOL AND ORLAN FOR USE IN OUTER SPACE
SHE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL SOFTWARE ENGINEER

I SAY THIS BECAUSE AFTER BEING IN THE BUSINESS FOR YEARS I AM VERY COMFORTABLE WITH MY IDE AND MY INTELLISENSE AND ALL THE WONDERS THAT MODERN PROGRAMMING AFFORDS ME

AND THIS LADY WROTE SOMETHING WITHOUT ALL THE FRILLS THAT WE HAVE NOW THAT HELPED PUT MEN ON THE MOON AND NOT KILL THEM IN THE PROCESS

AS MUCH AS I HAVE ADVANCED IN MY FIELD OVER THE YEARS AND HOW I EXPECT TO IN THE NEXT I DOUBT I'LL EVER GET TO HER LEVEL OF COMPETENCY AND DILIGENCE

A TRULY WELL DESERVED AWARD
SHE IS MY HERO

PAGES OF ASSEMBLY CODE THAT MUST WORK NO REALLY ONLY BILLION PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOUR CODE DO IT'S THING

IF YOU SCREW UP EVERY SINGLE NEWSPAPER WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN AND THAT WOMEN CAN'T BE TRUSTED WITH IMPORTANT JOBS YADDA YADDA OH AND THE ENTIRE WEIGHT OF THE PRIDE OF THE USA ON HER SHOULDERS CAUSE IMAGINE IF STUFF FAILED AND BUZZ NEIL AND THE 3RD GUY DIED AND SHE WAS



SO SHE HAD THE SINGLE MOST PRESSURE ON HER SHOULDERS OF ALL PROGRAMMING TASKS PERFORMED IN THE FREE WORLD IN THE CENTURY AND SHE PULLED IT OFFICIAL

AND ON TOP SHE IS A BADASS IF YOU LISTEN TO INTERVIEWS WITH HERALDRY I WISH EVERY LITTLE GIRL COULD HAVE A POSTER OF HER ON THE WALL BECAUSE THIS MIGHT JUST HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE JOB UNDERTAKEN BY A WOMAN IN THE CENTURY
HERE HETP SHE IS STANDING NEXT TO THE CODE SHE WROTE BY HAND IN

IT'S ABOUT TIME SOMEONE OF REAL SKILL WAS RECOGNIZED FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SPECIES WITHOUT HER CODE WE WOULD NEVER HAD STEPPED ON THE MOON

YOU INTEND TO START A DISCUSSION WITHOUT BRINGING ANYTHING TO THE TABLE YOURSELF

IN WHAT WAYS DO YOU BELIEVE THAT TITAN IS BETTER SUITED TO COLONIZATION IS IT JUST BECAUSE IT HAS NEARLY TR SAME ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AS EARTH
COLDER DARKER MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY HOSTILE OP WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY BETTER SUITED THE EXTREME SPORTS POTENTIAL IS GREAT PROPCYCLES AND AWESOME KRAKENFJORD KAYAKING BUT OTHER THAN THAT
CONS

EVEN LOWER GRAVITY

SATURNIAN RADIATION BELTS

SLIGHTLY HIGHER FUEL COSTS

LONGER PERIODS OF TIME IN DEEP SPACE

LESS SOLAR POWER

LESS GEOLOGICAL DATA TO WORK OFF OF

LONGER COMMUNICATION TIME

PROS

MORE SIGNIFICANT ATMOSPHERE PRESSURE

WITHIN SATURNIAN SYSTEM

AVAILABLE HYDROCARBONS

SIMILAR AIR PRESSURE

THAT'S WHAT I COULD THINK OF FEEL FREE TO POST MORE

IF WE ARE GONNA RANK PLANETS AS BEST FOR COLONIZATION MY VOTE IS ON VENUS CLOUD CITIES
I PREFER VENUS MYSELF CLOSER TO YOUR CONTENT FLOAT IN MORE FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS AT ALTITUDE ABUNDANCE OF ENERGY EASIER ACCLIMATISATION IN TERMS OF GRAVITY ETC
YES I IMAGINE THERE ARE MANY PLANETS WITH MORE EXTREME FEATURES THAN EARTH
IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE IT CATCHES ITSELF ON FIRE TOWARDS THE END IS THAT JUST FUEL TURNOFF
REMOVED
MY NAMES COMMANDER SHEPARD AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOSTER ON THE CITADEL
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF TECHNICAL INPUT ON THE VARIETY OF SYSTEMS USED TO MAKE THIS A REALITY BUT I DO NOT IT DOES HOWEVER LOOK LIKE A REALLY HAPPY PENIS TOUCHING DOWN
DID ANYONE ELSE READ THIS TITLE AND THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE NEW MASS EFFECT GAME
THIS LANDING IS ESPECIALLY COOL SINCE IT SURVIVED AN INFLIGHT ABORT TESTAMENT THEY DID NOT ASPECT THE BOOSTER TO SURVIVE BECAUSE THE BLAST FROM THE ABORT SYSTEM WOULD BLOW THE BOOSTER OFF COURSE

SLOW-MOTION REPLAY OF THE ABORT
IF YOU LAND SLOW AND GENTLE YOU WASTE A HUGE AMOUNT OF FUEL ELON MUSK

DAMN HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM LOOKS MORE AND MORE REAL EVERY NEW UPDATE
AN AMAZING TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT

EVEN SO SEEING THAT BURNING COLUMN OF FIRE HOLDING THE CRAFT IN SPACE STILL FEELS PRIMITIVE IN SOME WAY LIKE WE ARE STILL PLAYING WITH STICKS AND STONES AND HAVE YET TO DISCOVER THE REAL TOOLS THAT WILL PROPEL US INTO THE FUTURE FREE OF THE CONCERNS AND LIMITS OF CHEMICAL COMBUSTION
THIS LOOKS LIKE A WAY LESS EFFICIENT LANDING COMPARED TO THE FALCON
HOW DOES IT KEEP ITSELF UPRIGHT WHILST LANDING LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD TOPPLE OVER AT ANY SECOND
WOW THOSE REALLY CHEESY SPECIAL EFFECTS FROM SCI-FI MOVIES IN THE TURN OUT TO BE COMPLETELY ACCURATE

I'M A BOT AND I FIRST SAW THIS THREAD AT NOV UTC
I'VE SEEN ACRONYMS IN THIS THREAD WHICH IS THE MOST I'VE SEEN IN A THREAD SO FAR TODAY
ACRONYM LISTS CONTACT CREATOR PHS SOURCE CODE
SO FOR YOU CONTROL ENGINEERS HOW HARD OF A CONTROL PROBLEM IS THIS REALLY
THIS IS HOW MANKIND IS SUPPOSED TO BE FIND NEW WAYS BE WILLING TO FAIL AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX GLAD TO SEE SOME PEOPLE STILL WANT TO MAKE LEAPS AND BOUNDS
THIS LONG HOVERING LOOKS HORRIBLY INEFFICIENT THE ROCKET SPENDS SO MUCH FUEL JUST TO COUNTERACT GRAVITY I HOPE THAT THEY CAN MAKE LANDINGS BETTER IN THE FUTURE

COMPARE THAT TO LANDINGS OF FALCON S FIRST STAGE OR EVEN GRASSHOPPER IT LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
THE NEXT SPACE RACE SHE IS HERE LAST ONE TO MARS HAS TO DEAL WITH TRUMP
THE TOP LOOKS LIKE IT WAS PAINTED TO APPEAR AS ONE OF THE SHIPS IN SPACE INVADERS THAT IS AWESOME
FOR A SECOND I THOUGHT THIS WAS FOOTAGE FROM THE NEW MASS EFFECT ANDROMEDA AND WAS REALLY DAZZLED AS YO HOW SHEPARD IS A PART OF JT
MORE OR LESS A DECADE AGO I WAS LANDING CRAZY TAXIS ON LAUNCH PADS ON A GAME IN MY PHONE TODAY WE LAND ROCKETS TOMORROW
FOR SOME REASON I THOUGHT THIS IS ANOTHER HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM GCF UNTIL I LOOK AT THE SUB
IN THE MIDST OF A NASTY POLITICAL YEAR AT LEAST I CAN STILL GO READ ABOUT ENGINEERS DOING AMAZING THINGS WITH ROCKETS
IM COMMANDER SHEPARD AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE ROCKET LANDING ON THE INTERNET
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD BE CATCHING THESE ROCKETS WITH GIANT NETS IS THAT UNREASONABLE
WHY NOT JUST ALLOW THE ROCKET TO GLIDE IN FOR THE LANDING LIKE THE SHUTTLE DOES
AS MUCH AS I LOVED THE FIRST BLUE ORIGIN VIDEO I'VE WATCHED THE TEAMS REACTION TENS OF TIMES I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL LIKE THIS IS LESS OF AN ACCOMPLISHMENT NOW THAT THE FALCON IS IN THE GAME

WHICH IS A SHAME SINCE SUBORBITAL TRAFFIC IS ALSO OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE AND MAKING A LANDING LIKE THIS IS BIZARRELY AWESOME
THIS HAS MADE THAT MOON LANDER GAME I PLAYED AS A KID A THING AGAIN
SOMEONE NEEDS TO TURN THIS INTO A REMAKE OF THAT OLD WINDOWS LANDER GAME
THEY ARE GOING TO BE LANDING BARREL KEGS ON THE MOON OH HAPPY DAY
WE HAVE REACHED THE STAGE WHERE WHEN I FIRST LOOKED AT THAT VIDEO I THOUGHT PRETTY GOOD GAME GRAPHICS
JUST GOING TO POP IN AND DROP SOME SOURCE
HOW DOES IT HANDLE THE MASSIVE HEAT THAT MUST ALSO BE INCREASING THE CLOSER IT GETS TO THE GROUND ASTONISHING
HAVEN'T WE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM THE ALIENS YET MAKE IT WIDE AND SAUCER-SHAPED MUCH MORE STABLE
PERMISSION TO LAND LIKE A DAINTY BUTTERFLY

PERMISSION GRANTED NICE THAT WAS NICE
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES IT SEEM LIKE A BAD IDEA TO LAND IN SUCH A SANDY AREA GIVEN HOW ABRASIVE SAND CAN BE WHEN IT'S BEING BLOWN AROUND LIKE IN THE GIF
THEIR CONTROLS SCHEME SEND SO MUCH LESS ADVANCED THAN SPACE X THIS LOOKS LIKE A HOBBYIST IN COMPARISON WITH AN INDUSTRIAL GIANT
THIS DOESN'T SEEM NEARLY AS EFFICIENT AS LANDINGS WHICH USE A LOT MORE ISOLATED THRUST SHORTLY BEFORE TOUCHDOWN TO KILL THE BULK OF THE DESCENT VELOCITY NOT KNOWING HOW FAR ALONG THEY ARE ARE THERE PLANS TO IMPROVE THIS GIVEN HOW PRECIOUS THE WEIGHT ADDITIONAL FUEL IS IN TERMS OF COMPROMISING PAYLOAD CAPACITY
ISN'T THIS THE MOST ENERGY INTENSIVE WAY OF LANDING POSSIBLE THIS SEEMS TO ONLY BE REALLY USEFUL IN PRECISION LANDING IT SEEMS SIGNIFICANTLY WASTEFUL OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO BURN ALL THAT FUEL JUST TO SLOW DOWN AND BRING THE CRAFT TO A GRADUAL STOP AND CARRY ALL THAT FUEL TO YOUR FINAL DESTINATION AGAIN FOR THE SAME PURPOSE
LOOKS LIKE AN EARLY ARCADE GAME RBT FACE BIG EYES AND SMILING GRIN AT THE TOP IT'S ALSO THE SHAPE A VIRUS
I WOULD THINK THAT INCINERATING THE GROUND WOULD MAKE TOO SOFT A PLACE TO LAND BUT WHAT DO I KNOW
DISAPPOINTED BY THE LACK OF MASS EFFECT JOKES

SERIOUSLY HOWEVER THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TWO COMPANIES NOW WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THIS TECHNOLOGY IS MASSIVELY EXCITED SEEING BOZOS PUSHING THINGS MUSK BEING MUSK AND HEARING OTHERS JUMP INTO THE SPACE RACE IS ONLY GOING TO HELP POTENTIALLY EXCITING TIMES AHEAD FOR HUMANITY
A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS WHO GREW UP PLAYING MASS EFFECT NOW GET TO NAME EVERY SINGLE THING AS SHEPARD
HERE'S A SLIGHTLY SCIENCE QUESTION FOR YOU REDDIN MOST OF THESE TESTS LAND IN SAND ARE THE BOOSTERS NOT ENOUGH TO CAUSE ANY VITRIFICATION
BOT BEEP BEEP I'M ALL ABOUT TOP POSTS

THIS POST HAD UPVOTES AND GOT POSTED TO TWITTER AND SUBREDDIT R REDDIN

THE TWEET



ALL UPVOTES ARE ON AND R REDDIN

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL POSTS ON AND R REDDIN
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME IF THE SHUTTLE HAS A MECHANISM THAT WILL SUPPORT ITSELF IF ONE OF THE LEGS LANDS IN A HOLE
THIS IS COOL

I THOUGHT THIS WAS ANOTHER MASS EFFECT POST BUT THIS IS COOL TOO
FEELS LIKE THE THING COULD TIP OVER IF IT LANDED ON SOMETHING SLIGHTLY ELEVATED OR UNEVEN
IT LOOKS LIKE A CREEPY FLYING CLOWN IF YOU LOOK TO THE UPPERPART R PAREIDOLIA
ARE THERE ROCKETS ON THE TOP TO KEEP IT FROM FALLING OVER HOW DOES IT NOT TIP OVER AND CRASH
I SOMEHOW ALWAYS IMAGING THERE'S ALMOST NO FUEL LEFT IN THAT THING WHEN IT LANDS AND IT MIGHT TOTALLY RUN OUT AND FALL INTO ITS DESTRUCTION AT ANY MOMENT SECONDS BEFORE TOUCHDOWN
MY GIRLFRIENDS KIDS PLAY MINECRAFT AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THIS IS A CREEPER AMBRITE
WHY DON'T THESE BOOSTERS USE SOME FORM OF DRAG LIKE A PARACHUTE TO INCREASE STABILITY ON THE WAY DOWN
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE DOODLE THIS WITH ARMS BEHIND ITS HEAD R REALLIFEDOODLES
THEY SHOULD BUILD A CAMERA ON A STAND TO LOOK DOWN AT IT AS TO AVOID THE DUST SPRAY
AREN'T PARACHUTES EASIER AND CHEAPER THAN THESE BOOSTER LANDERS OR MAYBE A COMBINATION OF BOTH TO CONSERVE FUEL
MUCH SMARTER PEOPLE THAN ME MUST HAVE ALREADY CONSIDERED THIS WHAT ARE THE CONS OF SUCH A SYSTEM
ALL I CAN THINK OF IS ATTACH OR OF THESE TO SOMETHING LIKE A HELICOPTER AND YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE SCIFI VERTICAL LIFTOFF PLANES MAYBE IN A COUPLE OF DECADES
SO COOL JUST LIKE THE SCI-FI MOVIES AND TV SHOWS I WATCHED IN THE S AND SOUTH OKAY SO I NEVER GOT A JET PACK AND THE SIDEWALKS DON'T PROPEL ME ALONG LIKE A CONVEYOR BELT AT LEAST I LIVED TO SEE ROCKETS LAND ON THEIR TAILS

HOW ACCURATE ARE THE SIMULATIONS FOR SPACECRAFT CONTROL I WONDER IF DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS CAN BE A GOOD FIT FOR SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS OR IF ANYONE IS LOOKING AT THAT
NOW THE ISS CREW CAN ACTUALLY USE THEIR AMAZON PRIME ACCOUNTS FREE TWO DAY SHIPPING TO LOW EARTH ORBIT
WOULD A PYRAMID SHAPE NOT BE MUCH EASIER SAFER TO LAND NOT CRITICIZING JUST CURIOUS
NAH BRO PRETTY SURE THIS IS FOOTAGE FROM THE ORIGINAL THUNDERBIRDS SERIES
THIS REMINDS ME OF A BACTERIOPHAGE ABOUT TO DELIVER ITS PAYLOAD FRACTAL UNIVERSE UP IN HERE
WHY DON'T THEY SHOOT THIS AT A NON VISIBLE WAVELENGTH SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE SOMETHING OTHER THAN DUST
WHEN OLD SPACE MOVIES DID THIS I ALWAYS CRINGED AT HOW UNREALISTIC IT WAS FOR A VERTICAL ROCKET TO LAND LIKE THAT WAY LOOKS LIKE THEY WERE RIGHT

VIDEO COMMENT

CRS FIRST STAGE LANDING ON DRONESHIP 2 GRASSHOPPER DIVERT SINGLE CAM THIS LONG HOVERING LOOKS HORRIBLY INEFFICIENT THE ROCKET SPENDS SO MUCH FUEL JUST TO COUNTERACT GRAVITY I HOPE THAT THEY CAN MAKE LANDINGS BETTER IN THE FUTURE COMPARE THAT TO LANDINGS OF FALCON S FIRST STAGE OR EVEN GRASSHOPPER IT LO
ACHILLES AND THE TORTOISE SECOND ADVENTURES IN THOUGHT THERE ARE SEVERAL ZENON PARADOXES COUSCOUSOTTERCAT WAS PROBABLY REFERRING TO ACHILLES AND THE TURTLE
THE DICTATOR BUT IT MUST BE POINTY COMMANDER WHENEVER I SEE THE BLUE ORIGIN ROCKETS IT REMINDS ME OF THIS
THAT LOOKS LIKE A HUGE AUSTIN POWERS THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF WHEN I SAW THE PICTURE OF THE ROCKET
MAX Q IN-FLIGHT ESCAPE SLOW MOTION THIS LANDING IS ESPECIALLY COOL SINCE IT SURVIVED AN INFLIGHT ABORT TESTAMENT THEY DID NOT ASPECT THE BOOSTER TO SURVIVE BECAUSE THE BLAST FROM THE ABORT SYSTEM WOULD BLOW THE BOOSTER OFF COURSE SLOW-MOTION REPLAY OF THE ABORT
REPLAY OF IN-FLIGHT ESCAPE TEST LIVE WEBCAST JUST GOING TO POP IN AND DROP SOME SOURCE
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
NOT SURE IF THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE A PENIS OR A VIRUS BUT EITHER WAY AN IMPRESSIVE LANDING

REUSABLE ROCKETS ARE A GREAT ADVANCE BUT I AM STILL WAITING FOR SSTO
WOW YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY IMPRESSIVE S

THIS WAS LITERALLY DONE ON ANOTHER PLANET WHY IS THIS IMPRESSIVE
DELETED
ELON MUSK WELCOME TO THE CLUB OH WAIT YOU'RE STILL NOT IN THE CLUB YET
IT'S KIND OF UNDERWHELMING COMPARED TO WHAT FALCON IS ABLE TO DO NEW SHEPARD IS BASICALLY THE GRASSHOPPER TESTS JUST AT A HIGHER ALTITUDE FALCON IS VASTLY MORE COMPLEX AND FASTER STILL COOL THOUGH
OH GOD THE TESLA FANBOYS HAVE ENTERED THE THREAD AND ARE TRYING TO MAKE EVERYTHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE TOUCH OF MUSK LOOK LIKE SHIT WITH THEIR FACTS
OK I KNOW I KNOW SPACE TRAVEL AND EVERYTHING BUT THIS DOESN'T IMPRESS ME ANYMORE I'VE SEEN THIS

NOW DO IT ON MARS WITHOUT A WILE EAST COYOTE POOF
BEING THAT MANY MOON AND MARS ROVERS HAVE LANDED THE SAME WAY I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT THIS IS ANYTHING NEW
I WISH SOME OF YOU WOULD STEP OUT OF THE FANBOI COSTUME IT'S REALLY ANNOYING
HOW SMOOTH IS IT THOUGH FOR ALL WE KNOW THE INITIAL BOOST OR LANDING COULD GIVE SOMEONE A CONCUSSION IF SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO BE INSIDE SOMETHING CARRIED BY THESE
NOW TRY IT WITHOUT THE ALMOST INVISIBLE WIRE ATTACHED TO THE TIP OF THE ROCKET NOT SO EASY NOW HUH
I CAN HEAR FLAT CAROTHERS CRYING FAKE CONVENIENTLY DUSTY SO WE NEVER SEE THE ACTUAL LANDING
SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THE CHALLENGE HERE IS BRINGING IT BACK DOWN UPRIGHT WHY IS THIS COULDN'T THEY BRING IT DOWN ON ITS SIDE THEN JUST STAND IT BACK UP OR HAVE IT RIGHT ITSELF AGAIN WHEN THEY WANT TO RE-USE IT
IF ONE OF THOSE LANDED ON MY PLANET I WOULD EXPECT AN IMMINENT INVASION OF PERVERTS
WHY DOESN'T IT JUST LAND ON IT'S SIDE THE PROBLEM IS IT ALWAYS TIPS OVER SO WHY NOT BUAT HAVE RETRACTABLE ARMS ON THE SIDE THAT GENTLY MAKE IT LEAN OVER OR LIKE A BALLOON THAT POPS OUT TO LAND ON IT SEEMS TO MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE TO DO THAT THAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO LAND IN THE HARDEST POSSIBLE WAY WITH THE MOST AMOUNT OF THINGS THAT COULD GO WRONG
ISN'T THIS THE SPACESHIP FROM THAT CARTOON WITH THE ALIEN AND THE CAVEMAN MONKEY YOU DID THING RIGHT
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF THEY'RE REALLY MAKING THESE TO GO TO MARS OR IF THEY'RE MAKING THEM FOR EASIER RE-ENTRY WHEN THEY KILL US ALL WITH NUKES
I LOVE HOW THE FOOTAGE DOESN'T CUT SUDDENLY WHEN LANDING LIKE SPACE X DOES
DELETED
BUT ISN'T THE EARTH FLAT


SERIOUSLY THOUGH INTERESTING VIDEO WHAT CHANNEL IS THIS FROM
WHAT'S THAT BRIGHT WHITE DOT IN THE PICTURE IS SOL SECRETLY A BINARY OR SOMETHING OR IS THAT JUST BACKGROUND
HOW THE FUCK DO YOU WRITE AN ENTIRE ARTICLE WITHOUT LINKING TO THE GODDAMN PREPRINT LAZY FUCKS

GREAT RESEARCH THOUGH I WONDER WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NAME THIS PLANET
I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO READ THIS CHAPTER FROM THE AURANTIA BOOK READ IT WITH AN OPEN MIND IT COULD BE AN INTERESTING POSSIBILITY ABOUT AN ANCIENT VISITOR PLANETARY SYSTEM THAT BOOSTED AND DISRUPTED THE ORIGIN OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF TYPO A TENTH PLANET HAS BEEN DISCOVERED THERE'S ALREADY A NINTH PLANET
YEP BEEN NOTICING ALL OF THE EARTHQUAKES OF LATE IT'S COMING DOOM AND DREAD
I'M SHOCKED THAT THERE IS SO MUCH WASTED SPACE IN THAT CAN I REALLY THOUGHT THAT SPACE AND WEIGHT WERE REALLY AT A PREMIUM WHEN SHIPPING ITEMS UP TO THE ISS SO MUCH PACKAGING
I THOUGHT ONE OF THE RULES FOR FOOD IN SPACE IS THAT IT SHOULD BE CRUMBLES SO THEY THEY DON'T MESS WITH THE SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT
FORGOT WHERE I WAS AND WAS EXPECTING TO SEE SOME KIND OF ANIMAL POP IT'S HEAD OUT OF THE JAR WITH HOW MUCH THE NUTS WERE MOVING
I DIDN'T READ THE CAPTION AND THOUGHT IT WAS A CAN OF ALMONDS WITH WATER IN IT
I DIDN'T REALIZE AT FIRST THIS WAS IN SPACE AND THOUGHT SOMETHING ALIVE WAS IN THE CAN SHIVER
DIDN'T KNOW I WOULD ENJOY SEEING THIS SO MUCH UNTIL IT HAPPENED THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS GIF INTO MY LIFE OP
PAUL TURN THIS SPACE STATION AROUND THIS INSTANT WE PAID GOOD MONEY FOR MIXED NUTS NOT MIXING NUTS AND WE'RE GOING TO RETURN THEM
FOR THOSE UNAWARE THIS IS FROM A VIDEO BY CHRIS HADFIELD DURING EXPEDITION HERE'S A LINK TO THE VIDEO ON THE CSA YOUTUBE CHANNEL

I AM A BOTANY FAQ CODE
DIDN'T READ THE CAPTION THOUGH IT WAS A MASS OF BUGS MOVING THE NUTS
EVERYTIME I SAW SOMETHING FLOATING IN A SPACESHIP I GOT INTO A DEEP FEAR THAT THOSE LITTLE THINGS END UP BEING STRUCK IN SOME CRACKS AND CAUSING THE SHIP TO MALFUNCTION
AND FINALLY ASTRONAUTS YOU DRIVE MY CAR INTO A POOL I PREFER THE MIXED NUTS CAPER AT LEAST THAT WAS ORIGINAL

SO ARE THEY ALWAYS FLOATING LIKE THAT CLOSED I GET UNTIL IT HITS THE CANS INSIDE WHERE IT MOVES AT AN EXCITED RATE FREE FALLING
THEY SEEM LIKE A POOR CHOICE TO BRING INTO SPACE ONE PROBABLY NO BEER TWO THE SALT AND DUST THAT WOULD EMANATE FROM THAT CAN'T BE GOOD FOR THE EQUIPMENT ON BOARD
SAUCE

LOOKS LIKE THE CAN IS ALREADY OPEN
FOR SOME REASON MY BRAIN SCREAMS THIS WILL USE TOO MUCH CPU TIME ESPECIALLY WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW IT NEVER STOPS JUMPING AROUND EVEN IF ITS CLOSED AND NOONE WATCHES IT
WHEN I SEE THIS I IMAGINE THE ENERGY REQUIRED TO KEEP EACH NUT SUSPENDED IN SPACE LIKE THAT IT'S WEIRD TO THINK THAT THERE IS ENERGY KEEPING THEM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAN ON EARTH NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND
IS IT OVER HALF GONE ALREADY SEEMS A AWFUL LOT OF EMPTY SPACE IN A CAN IN SPACE WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE WASTED SPACE

WHAT AN AWKWARD FUCKING SENTENCE
I'M JUST IMAGINING MY LITTLE DOG TRYING TO HUNT FOR NUTS IF I LET THEM LOOSE ON THE ISS
IT LOOKS LIKE MY TURDS FIGHTING NOT TO BE SWALLOWED BY THE TOILET WHEN I FLUSH
THIS VISUAL IS HOW IT FEELS IN MY SCROTUM WHEN I'M REALLY INTO THE GIRL AND ABOUT TO NUT
SPACE N WEIGHT WASTED VAC SEALED BAGS NASA GOTTA FEEL UP THAT SPACE RESUPPLY ROCKETS WITH SOMETHING I SUPPOSE
HI HERE ARE JUST SOME RANDOM IDEAS

A LOT OF SPACE ROCKS COMETS SOME ASTEROIDS ARE JUST DIRTY SNOWBALLS YOU CAN MAKE A MODEL OF ONE USING ACTUAL DIRT FROM THE GARDEN OR SAND OR SOIL AND DRY ICE YOU CAN GET DRY ICE FROM MANY LARGE STORES FOR COOLING GOODS BUT ALSO SOME COMPANIES SEND OUT BOXES OF PELLETS DO WEAR GLOVES DO NOT STORE IT IN FRIDGE OR FREEZER IT'S COLDER THAN THOSE AND WILL TURN EVERYTHING INSIDE INTO BLOCKS OF ICE

YOU COULD MAKE A MODEL OF ONE AND A SYSTEM TO ATTACH A MINING BOT PROBE TO IT SECURELY OR A WAY TO MELT PARTS OF IT WITH A SOLAR REFLECTOR INSTEAD OF ACTUAL DRILLING SO THE PROBE WILL NOT REQUIRE LOTS OF EXPENSIVE SOLAR CELLS OR OTHER POWER SOURCES

OR MAKE THE PROBE HEAT A CERTAIN AREA TO ALTER THE COURSE IN ORDER TO BRING IT TO A MINING FACILITY BY HEATING ONE CERTAIN SPOT A GEYSER OF FROZEN GAS AND WATER WILL ERUPT GIVING THE WHOLE THING SOME PROPULSION THIS WAY YOU WOULD ONLY NEED SMALL DRONES TO COLLECT MATERIALS AND NOT MULTIPLE MINING PROBES THAT HAVE TO FIND MINE AND RETURN ALL THE STUFF


DIY DRY ICE COMETS





WEAR RAFTY GEAR GOGGLES GLOVES ON A FAIR USE LESS WATER AND NONE OF THE SMELLY OR STICKY COMPONENTS VINEGAR MAKE SURE OTHERS DON'T TOUCH THE DRY ICE





OF COURSE THERE ARE SOLID ASTEROIDS AND THESE WILL BE MOST INTERESTING FOR MINING SOME OF THE ABOVE STILL APPLIES DRILL THERE OR REDIRECT THEM HOW TO ANCHOR TO IT HOW TO DRILL



YOU COULD ALSO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES HOW TO DETERMINE WHAT THEY ARE MADE OF BEFORE FLYING TO THEM POSSIBLY MAKING A UNNECESSARY TRIP YOU CAN DO THAT REMOTELY TO SOME EXTEND BY SPECTROSCOPY HETP 2

HERE'S A LINK ON HOW TO BUILD A CHEAP CD SPECTROMETER




ALL YOU NEED IS SOME CARDBOARD AND A WORKS BEST THE RESOLUTION ISN'T GREAT BUT IT'S MUCH CHEAPER THAN A OPTICAL GRID

FROM AFAR YOU POINT A TELESCOPE AT THE ASTEROID AND SEE WHAT PORTIONS OF THE SUN'S LIGHT ARE REFLECTED THIS WAY YOU CAN DETERMINE WHAT IT'S SURFACE IS MADE OF CARBON ICE IRON

YOU CAN ALSO ESTIMATE IT'S MASS SIZE DISTANCE ORBITAL PERIOD AND MAKE GUESSES OF WHAT'S INSIDE LOTS OF MASS METAL

IF YOU LAND A PROBE ON THE THING YOU CAN USE A LASER OR SUN LIGHT TO EVAPORATE SOME SAMPLES DRAWING BETTER CONCLUSIONS IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A SIMPLIFIED EXPERIMENT BRING SEVERAL METALS AND HEAT THEM FLAME TEST 2 IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE MATERIALS YOU CAN GET COLORFUL BIRTHDAY FLAME CANDLES ON EBAY OR ALIEXPRESS LINK CHINESE SELLER SHIPPING TIMES

SURE SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS WOULD PROBABLY INCLUDE GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY BUT THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DEMONSTRATE



COME UP WITH OWN IDEAS READ THROUGH SOME SCIFI

INFLATABLE SPACE STATION MODULES ARE CURRENTLY BEING TESTED WITH MIXED RESULTS WHY NOT MAKE AN INFLATABLE MINING FACILITY SMALL ENOUGH TO SEND A SMALL PROBE WHICH UNPACKS AT THE ASTEROID BELT PERHAPS EXPANDING INTO A LARGE CONCENTRATING REFLECTOR COLLECTING METALS

OR FLY A SMALL PROBE THERE WHICH USES SOME MATERIALS FOUND IN THE ASTEROIDS TO BUILD PARTS FOR MINING RIGHT THERE INSTEAD OF BRINGING EVERYTHING BASICALLY A 3D PRINTER USING ASTEROIDS TO BUILD A LARGER MINING FACILITY AND PERHAPS ALSO EXTRACT WATER HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN TO MAKE FUEL FOR THE FLIGHT HOME


I'D LOVE TO FOCUS ON ASTEROID MINING IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE EXPERIMENT I COULD DO THAT RELATES TO THIS IDEA TESTING SOME FORM OF MINING

GOOGLE AROUND


CREATE A THEORY AND HYPOTHESIS

DUE TO THE EXTREME ENVIRONMENT DISTANCE AND LIMITED TECHNOLOGICAL ABILITY TO REACH AND RETURN FROM AN ASTEROID ANY MINING EQUIPMENT WOULD HAVE TO ENDURE EXTREMES AND BE LIGHT WEIGHT TO CARRY INTO SPACE UNDER CURRENT ABILITIES


THE MOST PROFICIENT WAY TO MINE AN ASTEROID WOULD BE TO TRANSPORT LIGHTWEIGHT AND MANAGEABLE CUTTING EQUIPMENT FOR REMOVING LARGE MANAGEABLE CHUNKS TO THE ASTEROID PLACING THEM IN RETURN POD DESIGNED FOR RE-ENTRY SAME AS A RETURN SHUTTLE AND KNOCKING THEM DOWN INTO EARTHS ATMOSPHERE WHERE THEY CAN BE RETRIEVED FROM THE COULD BE AN UNMANNED VENTURE


TEST IT

DO SOME MATH AND GOOGLING SEEING WHO HAS WORKED ON THESE IDEAS OR SIMILAR THAT YOU HAVE CREATE SCALE MODELS AND ATTEMPT TO SIMULATE THE ENVIRONMENT


EVALUATE

VIEW YOUR RESULTS AND FIDDLE WITH YOUR THEORY AND HYPOTHESIS IF NEEDED AND THEN TEST AGAIN






I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT ANY OF THIS MINING STUFF AND I MADE UP EVERYTHING ABOVE BUT IF I HAD TO DO A SCIENCE PROJECT ABOUT ASTEROID MINING I WOULD START OFF LIKE THAT HOPE I HELPED A LITTLE

A SIMPLE INEXPENSIVE ONE WOULD BE TO GO TO A NEARBY MINE OR DRY SAND AREA COLLECT A SAMPLE OF A GIVEN VOLUME THEN TAKE IT BACK TO A BEAKER HEAT IT UP SEND IT THROUGH A CONDENSER AND SEE HOW MUCH WATER CAN BE EXTRACTED THE ENERGY REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A GIVEN VOLUME OF WATER EVEN THE DRIEST PARTS OF EARTH WILL STILL HAVE MORE WATER IN THE SAND THAN THE SURFACE OF ANY ASTEROID OR THE MOON THIS EXPERIMENT WOULD PROBABLY ONLY RESULT IN DROPS
I DO NOT REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES THIS WAS REPASTED BUT STILL EVERY TIME IT AMAZES ME
THE MAIN ISS MODULES ARE DESIGNED TO LAST YEARS SO APPEARS TO BE THE REALISTIC END DATE OF THIS INTERNATIONAL PEACEFUL PROJECT I HOPE THERE IS A SUCCESSOR MAYBEE MORE THAN ONE
MAY SOMEONE PHOTOSHOP EARTH IN THERE TO SCALE I CANT SEEM TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND HOW LARGE THAT REALLY IS
WHAT CAUSES SOME OF THE EJECTION TO SPIRAL BACK IN TOWARDS THE POINT OF ERUPTION

EDIT THANKS FOR THE EXPLANATIONS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE PHYSICS I'M GLAD MY HIGHEST RATED COMMENT IS ABOUT MASSIVE EXPANSES OF ENERGY THAT COULD ANNIHILATE OUR ENTIRE PLANET IN SECONDS
IF THIS IS TIME LAPSE HOW LONG WOULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS TAKE IN REAL TIME MINUTES HOURS DAYS
AREN'T SOLAR FLARES POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FATAL IF THERE IS A LARGE ENOUGH ONE DIRECTED TOWARDS EARTH CAN ANYONE ELABORATE ON THIS AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT HAPPENING TO ME IT REMINDS ME A A BRAIN ANEURYSM IT CAN SUDDENLY HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT AND KILL US OR AM I WRONG

EDIT THANKS FOR THE RESPONSES
THIS IS LIKELY A PICTURE FROM THE SOLAR DYNAMICS OBSERVATORY FUNDED UNDER THE AUSPICE OF THE NOAA AND NASA LIVING WITH A STAR PROGRAM

PICTURES LIKE THESE ARE NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE 2 BILLION DOLLAR COMPONENT OF THE BILLION DOLLAR NASA BUDGET DEDICATED TO EARTH AND CLIMATE SCIENCES ABOUT OF THE US BUDGET IN TOTAL
THIS IS GOING TO BE MY ASS AFTER OUR THANKSGIVING THIS THURSDAY
WHEN THE ERUPTION HAPPENS YOU SEE A CURIOUS ARTIFACT TO THE RIGHT OF IT WITH SEVERAL LAYERS OF COLOR IN WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS A VISUAL ECHO IS THIS THE RESULT OF IMAGE PROCESSING CAPTURE OR IS IT ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE SUN
WHY DOES IT SEEM TO GET SUCKED BACK INTO WHERE IT CAME OUT INSTEAD OF JUST FALLING BACK DOWN TO THE SURFACE LIKE A PROJECTILE

EDIT AVM THAT'S THE 2ND HIGHEST COMMENT
HOW HAS THIS BEEN EDITED HAS IT BEEN RECOLORED IS THIS REAL TIME OR SCALED DOWN FROM HOURS OF FOOTAGE I LOVE THESE VIDEOS BUT I NEVER FEEL I CAN TRUST IT TO BE CORRECT
I FIND SOLAR PHYSICS SO DAMN CREEPY LOOK AT HOW SOME OF THE EJECTED MATTER IS APPARENTLY VACUUMED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL POINT OF ERUPTION AS IF IT'S GOING BACK IN TIME WHAT DOES THAT
HAVEN'T TAKEN A SCIENCE CLASS IN A WHILE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SUN THAT CAUSES THIS AND IS THE MOVING SURFACE OF THE SUN JUST HUGE CLUSTERS OF EXPLOSIONS LIKE NUCLEAR BOMBS
IF WE WEREN'T TOLD THIS WAS THE SUN IT COULD EASILY PASS FOR A MICROSCOPIC VIEW OF A CELL
JESUS THE MAJESTY OF THOSE SNARING FLAMES NEAR THE SURFACE THE SUN IS SO INTENSE IT'S BEAUTIFULLY INTENSE
IT IMMEDIATELY MADE ME THINK OF A GIANT PIMPLE BEING POPPED YOU CAN SEE THE PLASMA NOT JUST FLOW BUT SQUIRT I IMAGINE A SUNSPOT AFTERWARDS AND A NEIGHBOR STAR TELLING SOL TO STOP PICKING AT IT
THE SUN IS PREDICTING WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME AFTER THANKSGIVING DINNER TOMORROW
SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION TONS OF HYDROGEN BURNED EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF EVERY SINGLE DAY
WHY DO WE HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT AFTER THE ERUPTION PART OF THE GASES ARE SUCKED BACK INTO THE SUN
I GOT A COLD CHILL DOWN MY SPIN WATCHING GRAVITY PULL THE FLAME BACK INTO ITSELF
WHY IS THAT MOST OF THE BLOWN UP MATTER GOES BACK TO THE SOURCE AND DOES NOT JUST DROPS DOWN EVENLY ONTO THE SURFACE OF THE STAR
EDIT DON'T BOTHER ALL I HAD TO DO IS SCROLL DOWN THANKS TO U ZYXZEVN
A QUESTION FOR THE SCIENTISTS IS THE MATERIAL FLOWING BACK INTO THE EJECTION POINT DOING SO DUE TO A PRESSURE GRADIENT EQUALISATION CAUSED BY THE SUDDEN OUTFLOW

OR IS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON
REMINDS ME OF THE WHIP FROM PETER FIRST LOAR MOVIE
SPACE WEATHER HAS BEEN CALM LATELY WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS SOLAR MINIMUM NASA KEEP EM COMING
DAMN LOOK AT THOSE MAGNETIC FIELD LINES THOUGH BECOMING VISIBLE WHEN THE CHARGED PARTICLES BARRAGE THEM NOTICE THE CURVATURE THIS PLASMA ERUPTION MUST BE ALMOST A HUNDRED EARTHS WIDE IMAGINE SPITTING A BIG BOOGIE ON AN ANTIQUITIES THAT'S WHAT THESE PLASMA ERUPTIONS ARE TO THE EARTH
THE ENERGY THAT WOULD HAVE HAD TO GO INTO THAT ERUPTION IS EASILY MORE POWER THAN ANYTHING HUMANS HAVE EVER ACCOMPLISHED IF WE COMPARED EVERY NUKE WE EVER MANUFACTURED IT WOULD BE LAUGHABLE AT HOW MINISCULE THAT POWER IS COMPARED TO THIS ERUPTION NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE ENERGY THAT IS DISPLAYED HERE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO NOT ONLY WIPE OUT OUR EXISTENCE BUT ERASE ANY AND ALL EVIDENCE WE EVER EXISTED THE ONLY THINGS LEFT ARE THE ROVERS AND PROBES WE'VE SENT OUT OF ORBIT
ONCE YOU WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THE SCALE OF THE THING BLOODY TERRIFYING
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THIS STAR HAD SOME GAS



SOMEONE FUCKING KILL ME
I JUST REALIZED SOLAR PROMINENCES FLARES IS BASICALLY JUST THE SUN LETTING OUT A MASSIVE HOT FART
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE HELL WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE IN THERE TRAPPED AND DROWNING
YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT OF THE FLARE RACE ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE SUN UNREAL
DOWNVOTING AS THIS IS WAY TOO POLITICAL FOR ME TO HANDLE RIGHT NOW U SPAZ CAN YOU PLEASE EDIT OP
AND THE TV AND RADIO MEDIA TOTALLY IGNORED HERALDRY NOT ONE SINGLE MENTION PATHETIC
ALSO AMONG THE AWARDEES WAS GRACE HOPPER DIED ANOTHER MAJOR FEMALE PIONEER IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
FINEST FINANCIAL EXPERTS BOLDLY GOING WHERE NO-ONE HAS GONE BEFORE
S

ACTUALLY AT C IT'S YEARS

INPUT I RELATIVISTIC

WOLFRAM ALPHA IS AWESOME FOR THIS KIND OF THING
THAT IS DEFINITELY A BIT OFFICIAL AT C FOR WEEK IN THE SHIPS REFERENCE FRAME SOMEONE ON EARTH WOULD EXPERIENCE ABOUT WEEKS WHICH IS A FAR CRY FROM THE YEARS YOU ARE HEARING YOU CAN COMPUTE THIS USING THE FOLLOWING EQUATION FROM SPECIAL RELATIVITY

T SQRT V 2 C 2 WHERE T IS THE IS THE TIME EXPERIENCED ON EARTH IS THE TIME EXPERIENCED IN THE SHIP AND V IS THE VELOCITY OF THE SHIP RELATIVE TO EARTH IF YOU GOOGLE TIME DILATION YOU CAN GO INTO A BIT MORE DEPTH

SOURCE PHYSICS GRADUATE STUDENT
RELATED QUESTION
DOES TIME DILATION AFFECT LIGHT ITSELF
IOW SINCE LIGHT SPEED VARIES DEPENDING ON LOCATION SPACE VS ATMOSPHERE ETC COULD LIGHT TRAVELLING UNENCUMBERED ACROSS THE VAST REACHES OF SPACE DILATE TIME WHILE TRAVELLING SO THAT THE DISTANCE OF A LIGHT YEAR IS ACTUALLY SHORTER OR LONGER THAN A SIMPLE SPEED DISTANCE EQUATION THUS INSTEAD OF A STRAIGHT LINE GRADIENT THE ACTUAL DISTANCE WOULD BE A CURVED FUNCTION IN SEC IT TRAVELS X MILES BUT IN SECONDS IT TRAVELS LESS THAN MORE THAN IN ONE HOUR IT TRAVELS LESS THAN MORE THAN
SO FAR WE HAVE YEARS YEARS AND WEEKS

CAN SOME SMART PEOPLE GIVE US THE REAL ANSWER
ISN'T SPACE X THE EXACT KIND OF THING CONSERVATIVE GROUPS SHOULD BE CHAMPIONING IT'S A POSTER CHILD FOR THE ABILITY OF INNOVATIVE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TO DO THINGS THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T
WHEN YOU CAN'T COMPETE YOU SUE OR USE GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION TO STOP THE THREAT
IT'S NOT A CONSERVATIVE PAC IT'S FASCIST THEY'RE AGAINST OPTIMISM AND BUILDING A FUTURE THE ATTITUDE EMBODIED BY COMPANIES IS IDEOLOGICALLY REPULSIVE TO THEM
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY MASTER LIST BUT HERES SOME WORTH NOTING

THIS LISTS A BUNCH OF SMALLEST LAUNCHERS IN DEVELOPMENT MOSTLY BY STARTUPS A FEW ESTABLISHED COMPANIES IN THERE THOUGH

PLANETARY RESOURCES AND DEEP SPACE INDUSTRIES ARE BOTH STARTUPS WORKING ON ASTEROID MINING MAINLY FOR ORBITAL FUEL PRODUCTION NOTABLY GEORGE SOWERS HAS MENTIONED ULA IS SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT PLANETARY RESOURCES TO BUY FUEL FROM FOR ACES CIRC BOTH COMPANIES HAVE TEST SATELLITES ALREADY IN ORBIT DEMONSTRATING VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES

BIGELOW AEROSPACE AND AXIOM SPACE ARE WORKING ON SPACE STATION MODULES BOTH FOR USE AS ISS ADDITIONS AND LATER THEIR OWN PRIVATE STATIONS BIGELOW SEEMS THE FURTHEST ALONG HERE THEY'VE GOT BEAM ALREADY IN TESTING ON ISS AND HARDWARE IN PRODUCTION FOR A LAUNCH IN

SPACEFLIGHT INC DOES RIDESHARE LAUNCHES A BUNCH OF TINY SATELLITES MANIFESTED ON ONE LAUNCH THEY'VE GOT A COUPLE DIFFERENT PAYLOAD CARRIERS FLYING ALREADY ON VARIOUS ROCKETS FROM OTHER COMPANIES AND THEIR SHERPA PLATFORM CAN CARRY LIKE SATELLITES AT ONCE

NANORACKS DOES SATELLITE DEPLOYMENTS FROM ISS AND ITS VARIOUS LOGISTICS VEHICLES THEY'RE ALSO HOPING TO INSTALL A COMMERCIAL AIRLOCK THERE IN A FEW YEARS AND THEY'RE CONTRACTING WITH BLUE ORIGIN TO MANAGE PAYLOAD ACCOMMODATIONS ON THEIR SUBORBITAL FLIGHTS

BLUE ORIGIN IS DOING SUBORBITAL LAUNCHES AND HOPES TO FLY A CREW NEXT YEAR THEY'VE GOT A REUSABLE VERTICAL LANDING ROCKET THEY'VE BUILT THE WORLDS FIRST TAP-OFF CYCLE ENGINE CURRENTLY USED ON NEW SHEPHERD PLANNED FOR USE ON ORBITALATKS NEW ROCKET AND NEW GLENN AND PROPOSED FOR USE ON THEY'RE CLOSE TO HAVING THE FIRST AMERICAN STAGED COMBUSTION ENGINE DONE WHICH IS THE APPARENT ENGINE CHOICE FOR VULCANS FIRST STAGE AND THEY PLAN TO BUILD A REUSABLE ISH TON TO LEO ROCKET BY THEY'RE ALSO IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH NASA TO RE-ENTER THE COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM

ACOR AEROSPACE HAS BEEN WORKING ON A REUSABLE CREWED SUBORBITAL SPACEPLANE THOUGH DEVELOPMENT SEEMS TO HAVE STALLED NOW THEY'RE FOCUSING ON ENGINE DEVELOPMENT HOPING TO SELL ENGINES TO SOMEONE

MASTEN SPACE SYSTEMS HAS BEEN DEVELOPING VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING ROCKETS FOR A WHILE RIGHT NOW THEY'VE GOT A CONTRACT WITH DARPA TO DEVELOP A CONCEPT FOR THE XS LAUNCH VEHICLE THEIR DESIGN WOULD HAVE A REUSABLE VTOL SPACEPLANE AS A FIRST STAGE PLUS AN EXPENDABLE UPPER STAGE THEY'RE ALSO WORKING WITH ULA TO BUILD A LUNAR LANDER UPPER STAGE COMBINATION

REACTION ENGINES LIMITED IS WORKING ON THE SABER ENGINE THAT WOULD START AS AN AIR-BREATHING JET ENGINE AND THEN TRANSITION TO A ROCKET AT HIGH ALTITUDES THEY'RE HOPING TO USE THAT DESIGN ON KRYLON A SINGLE STAGE SPACEPLANE AND HYPERSONIC AIRCRAFT THEY'VE ALSO GOT SOME MORE CONCEPTUAL WORK GOING ON WITH SPACE TUGS AND INTERPLANETARY MANNED MISSIONS BUT THATS ALL CONTINGENT ON KRYLON WORKING
U KING BANNING PORN AND TRUMP WILL BE PRESIDENT THANK GOD WE'RE UP HERE
PUT IT AROUND THE MOON THAT'D SIMPLIFY ALL OUR DEEP SPACE REFUELING NEEDS
DDK ABOUT YOU GUYS BUT I JUST WANT TO COMPILE HOURS WORTH OF SPACE VIDEOS AND PLAY THEM ON A VR HEADSET WITH MY DONG OUT
AN ANIMATED VERSION WITH A 3D EFFECT OF MY IMAGE ORIGINAL POST IMAGE AND DETAILS ABOUT IT HERE

THE 3D EFFECT HAS BEEN MADE BY PIERRE MARCUSE USING THE TECHNIQUE EXPLAINED BY DYLAN FOR THE ASTRO IMAGING CHANNEL


EDIT A LOT MORE INFORMATIONS HERE
DELETED
IT TOOK ME SO LONG TRYING TO MAKE THE OPTICAL ILLUSION STOP UNTIL I ZOOMED IN AND REALIZED IT ACTUALLY WAS MOVING XD
SORRY IF I SOUND DUMB HERE BUT WHICH ONE IS WHICH I'M ASSUMING THE LONGER YELLOW ONE IS THE TADPOLE AND THE BLUE IS THE FLAMING STAR NEBULA BUT HONESTLY IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE EITHER WAY
IT'S CUTE BUT I'M WONDERING IF ANYONE HAS ACTUALLY CREATED A REAL ASTRONOMY IMAGE THAT HAS CAPTURED A 3D PERSPECTIVE BEFORE
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CREATIVITY AND SHARING THIS

THIS IS VERY COOL LOOKING EFFECT BUT A QUESTION

READING DEEPER SEEMS THE TOP PART IC LY AWAY AND THE BOTTOM PART IC IS LY AWAY BUT THE EFFECT OF THE IMAGE MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE TO ME THEY THE TWO LIGHT FOREGROUND COLORED REGIONS ARE MOVING AS ONE UNIT CONFINED TO A RANGE OF SPACIAL VOLUME ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE IMAGE WE'RE LOOKING AT IE THE TOP DOESN'T LOOK FARTHER AWAY IN THIS EFFECT AGAIN TO ME THE TWO MAIN BRIGHT PARTS OF THE IMAGE LOOK ABOUT EQUAL DISTANCE AWAY

DATA FROM THE DESCRIPTION HERE
PIERREMARKUSE POSTS FN SFC TRUE

WAS THE INTENT TO GIVE A VIEWER A GOOD PICTURE OF THE GEOMETRY WE MEASURE IF SO MAYBE MY PERCEPTION OF THE EFFECT IS OFF OR MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO ROK SUCH INCREDIBLY LARGE DISTANCES


ANYONE ELSE SEE A SLIGHT OUTLINE OF AAG IN THE AVATAR STATE HEAD DOWN BLUE SPOT IS THE ARROW
ANY ESTIMATES ON THE DISTANCES BOTH FROM THE NEBULA AND THE HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT ONE WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL TO ACHIEVE THIS VISUAL EFFECT
WHILE THIS IS MINDBLOWINGLY BEAUTIFUL JUST SAY NO TO VERTICAL VIDEOS
IS THERE ANY VIDEO APP OR ANIMATION THAT SHOWS THE REAL DISTANCES BETWEEN THE STARS THAT MAKE EACH CONSTELLATION
I WONDER IF THERE'S A WAY TO CALCULATE HOW FAR THE CAMERA MOVES IN THIS IMAGE LY LY
IF YOU TURN YOUR PHONE AT JUST THE RIGHT SPEED YOU CAM MAKE IT EVEN MORE NOTICEABLE
I DROPPED ACID LAST NIGHT AND WHEN I SAW THIS I FREAKED OUT THINKING I WAS STILL HALLUCINATING LAO
LINK TO NASA PRESS RELEASE
I SAW THE TITLE AND MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT WAS ANOTHER OVERHOPED THEORY VERY HAPPY TO SEE THIS IS REAL NEWS
FROM THE NASA PRESS RELEASE

IT REPRESENTS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF ALL KNOWN WATER ICE ON MARS

A DEPOSIT THIS LARGE ONLY MAKES UP I HONESTLY DIDNT KNOW THERE WAS THAT MUCH

BUT WHAT MAKES THIS DISCOVERY SIGNIFICANT IS ITS LOCATION AND ACCESSIBILITY

THIS DEPOSIT IS PROBABLY MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN MOST WATER ICE ON MARS BECAUSE IT IS AT A RELATIVELY LOW LATITUDE AND IT LIES IN A FLAT SMOOTH AREA WHERE LANDING A SPACECRAFT WOULD BE EASIER THAN AT SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS WITH BURIED ICE

SO FOR POTENTIAL INHABITANTS OF MARS THIS COULD BE A VERY VALUABLE RESOURCE

I'D LOVE TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL WHEN ELON MUSK FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS
EACH DAY I SEE NEWS LIKE THIS FILLS ME WITH HOPE THAT WE CAN GO TO THESE PLACES IN MY LIFETIME
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF FINDING COOL MICROBES WAY BEFORE USING IT AS DRINKING WATER EVEN CROSSES MY MIND
REMEMBER THE S WHEN EVERYONE WAS STILL ARGUING OR CLINGING TO THAT THERE'S NO WATER ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE THAT WAS A FUNNY TIME

WE'RE TOTALLY THE ONLY LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE THOUGH
I FEEL LIKE THE UNITED STATES COULD BE MADE SLIGHTLY BETTER IF THERE WERE A NEW MEXICO SIZED LAKE COVERING THE SURFACE OF NEW MEXICO
WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE WATER IS NOT REALLY USEABLE OR HARD TO BE MADE USEABLE

HARMFUL CHEMICALS WE CAN'T TEST FOR THEM WITH RADAR ONLY
RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION

ARE THOSE JUST MY PLEB FEARS OR COULD THERE BE SOMETHING TO FINDING OUT THAT THE WATER IS NOT DRINKABLE AND MIGHT NEED CRAZY REFINERIES IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FIRST SETTLERS ON ARRIVAL
I'M LATE TO THE PARTY BUT IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN A TL R OF THE PAPER IT'S IN MY BLOG POST HERE

BLOGS
AS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T FOLLOW SPACE STUFF MUCH WHAT DOES THIS SIGNIFY
THEY SAY THERE ARE NO STUPID QUESTIONS

WHAT EXACTLY MAKES THINGS A LAKE VS AN OCEAN WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER PLANETS OVERALL SIZE OR DEPTH IS IT POSSIBLE THAT UNDER THE FROZEN LAKES THERE IS WARMER TEMPERATURES THAT WOULD MAKE IT ALMOST LIKE SLUSH OR LIQUID WATER I'D IMAGINE THAT WOULD INCREASE LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL LIFE
UTOPIA POLANISIA I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE HERE THAT THINKS THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE
WHY IS FROZEN THE ONLY WORD NOT IN ALL CAPS IN THE TITLE THAT'S REALLY BOTHERING ME
MARS HAS LOTS OF WATER
WE WANT TO BUILD CITIES ON MARS
WE WANT TO TERRACIFORM MARS OVER THE NEXT YEARS OR SO

HOW DO WE PLAN THE CITIES ON MARS NOW SO THAT GLOBAL WARMING DOES NOT DROWNED THEM WHEN IT HAPPENS
IS ANYONE CONCERNED THAT NESTLE WILL SOMEHOW GET ACCESS TO THIS RESOURCE
SO COME ON IS IT NEW MEXICO OR LAKE SUPERIOR

HOW IS THIS COMPARED TO THE SIZE OF WALES HMM
HERE'S A SOUNDTRACK TO ACCOMPANY YOUR SHORT HOP TO DESOLATION AND LONELINESS
IHSAHN FROZEN LAKES ON MARS
I JUST WATCHED EUROPA REPORT YESTERDAY SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND SAY WE SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THAT
HAS ANYONE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE SHIT BURIED IN THE ICE I MEAN ISN'T THE THEORY THAT MARS ONCE HAD LIFE I MEAN BODIES ARE STILL UP ON EVEREST FROM THE SOUTH IT'S A POSSIBILITY RIGHT
I'M CONFUSED I THOUGHT WE ALREADY MAPPED OUT THE SURFACE THROUGH SATELLITES I THINK I'VE SEEN MAPS OF MARS BEFORE HOW DID WE NOT KNOW ABOUT A LAKE OF THIS SIZE AND WHY DIDN'T IT SHOW UP ON EXISTING MAPS

EDIT AH FROZEN WITH A THIN LAYER OF SOIL SHOULD HAVE READ FIRST
IT LOOKS LIKE ALL OF THE BRACKING TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE BEEN PERFECTING WILL COME IN HANDY ON MARS
SINCE WHEN DID NEW MEXICO BECOME THE STANDARD MEASURE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL DISCOVERIES I AM PERPLEXED BY THE CHOICE AND EXCITED BY THE FIND
WE NEED TO GET T OFF THIS PLANET TERAFORM CLAIM A STAKE FOR THE PEOPLE BEFORE CORPORATIONS DO IT FOR US AND FORMAT LAWS FOR US WHERE WE HAVE NO RIGHTS TO THE SECOND HOME WORLD
THE TITLE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TERRIBLY MISLEADING THE DEPOSIT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE A LAKE IT'S MORE LIKE A GIANT PILE OF SNOW MIXED WITH DUST AND BLANKETED IN DIRT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SOLID BODY OF WATER THERE WERE NO LAKES INVOLVED IN ITS FORMATION AND THERE'S NEGLIGIBLE EVIDENCE OF THERE EVER BEING LIQUID WATER IN IT
HOW CAN I BECOME AN ASTRONAUT THAT GOES TO MARS

MARS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN HUMAN HISTORY AS OF RIGHT NOW AND I WANT TO BE APART OF IT
MAYBE A STUPID QUESTION BUT IS THIS A SURFACE OR UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR IF IT IS ON THE SURFACE SHOULDN'T SCIENTIST BE ABLE TO DETECT THE REFLECTION OF WATER ICE FROM A SATELLITE
APPARENTLY FROM THE TIME WHEN I WAS A BOY TIL NOW WE'VE GONE FROM WELL THERE USED TO BE WATER ON MARS MAYBE BUT NOT ANYMORE ASTEROIDS OR SOMETHING YEAH NO WATER TO OH LOADS OF WATER ON MARS LOADS CHOCK FULL OF IT CAN'T MOVE FOR THE STUFF
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS CAN SOMEONE SMARTER THAN ME EXPLAIN PLEASE
WE LIVE IN THE WARM ZONE OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM THEREFORE FINDING FROZEN AREAS IS OK FOR AN ATMOSPHERE LIKE MARS
SO THE ARTICLE STATES THAT WATER EVAPORATES IF EXPOSED TO THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET WHAT HAPPENS IF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT KEEPS GETTING EVAPORATED WHERE DOES IT ALL GO IF SUCH A SOURCE WAS ABSORBED WOULD THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CLIMATE OF MARS
PRESS RELEASE WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ARTICLE NEXT TIME PLEASE LINK DIRECTLY TO THE ORIGINAL
SAYS IN THE ARTICLE THAT THE PLANET'S AXIS SWITCHED OVER TIME HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN
MARS GET READY FOR SOME DAMN AMERICAN STYLE FREEDOM COMING YOUR WAY
MARTIAN WATER THE NEXT MARKET BOOM
DON'T WORRY THERE IS STILL WATER IN SPACE LET'S KEEP CONTAMINATING THE ONE WE HAVE HERE
WATER ON THE SURFACE AND BIG ICE LAKES THERE IS ABSOLUTELY SOME MARKETING MATERIAL OR LIFE ON MARS TO GET THIS MUCH ATTENTION FROM SPACE AND OTHERS
JUST PUT ROADS AND CARS THERE WITH PEOPLE DRIVING THEM AND WE CAN WARM THAT PLANET IN NO TIME
THIS IS EXCITING NEWS

I WONDER HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO PROCESS THAT ICE INTO DRINKING WATER
SO I'M SURE THIS IS A STUPID QUESTION BUT HOW DO WE KNOW IT IS HOW DO WE CONFIRM THE CHEMICAL MAKE UP
IT'S FACE REMINDED ME OF THIS
DO NOT DRINK THE WATER NOT EVEN A DROP WATER IS PATIENT WATER CAN WAIT
OH GREAT WATER ON MARS WHAT COULD GO WRONG
WOULD ANYONE WHO KNOWS BE ABLE TO ADD TO THIS SOME DETAIL ABOUT POSSIBLE LANDING AREAS OR SETTLEMENT AREAS FOR NASA SPACE ETC IS THIS THE KIND OF PLACE WE WOULD BE SETTLING ARCTIC TUNDRA WITH THE ODD DUST STORM
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER WHEN MARS HAS NO WATER AT ALL IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A VERY LONG TIME AGO AND NOW THEY ARE FINDING LAKES PEOPLE THOUGHT IT HAD CANALS BEFORE THAT
THIS IS AN HONEST QUESTION MY APOLOGIES IF IT SOUNDS STUPID HOW DIDN'T WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS I ASSUMED WE HAD MARS MORE OR LESS MAPPED OUT SOMETHING THE SIZE OF NEW MEXICO SEEMS LIKE IT'D BE HARD TO MISS
I BELIEVE I REMEMBER HEARING THAT A GOOD DEAL OF THE WATER ON MARS CONTAINED TOXIC SALTS AND OTHER HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IS THIS LAKE BELIEVED TO BE SIMILARLY TOXIC
HAVEN'T READ THE ARTICLE BECAUSE BANDWIDTH IS IT ACTUAL THAWABLE THEN PETRIFIABLE THEN DRINKABLE WATER OR JUST TRACE AMOUNTS OF IT IN FROZEN SOMETHING ELSE
I KNOW LIQUID ON MARS IS A DEAD DUCK PRETTY QUICK BUT IF THEY BREACH THE PROTECTIVE DIRT LAYER IS THERE A CHANCE THEY COULD STARTING BOILING THE ICE OFF
THERE HAS TO BE LIFE OUTSIDE OF EARTH I LIKE TO THINK OF THE SAYING ANY THING THAT CAN HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN EXPANSIVE THE UNIVERSE IS AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WILL EXIST LIFE MUST BE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE WE KNOW LIFE CAN HAPPEN BECAUSE OF EARTH THE PLANETS ARE JUST TOO FAR AWAY AND UNIVERSE IS JUST TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE ABLE TO CONTACT ANY OTHER FORMS OF LIFE AS OF NOW BUT WHAT CAN HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN AND I DON'T BELIEVE EARTH IS AN ISOLATED EVENT
I THINK I GOT CANCER JUST READING THE HEADLINE AND THE BLURB I SERIOUSLY REGRETTED THAT CLICK
HOW IS IT CITED TOTAL RECALL AS HAVING THIS EXACT THING AS PART OF THE PLOT CRAZY
THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE USED A DIFFERENT SCALE A LOT OF AMERICANS LET ALONE PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES FORGET NEW MEXICO EXISTS AND PROBABLY HAVE NO IDEA OF ITS SIZE
SO IF THE ICE WAS FORMED BY SNOWFALL WHERE DID THE WATER IN THE ATMOSPHERE COME FROM THAT'S A LOT OF FREAKING MOISTURE
SOMEONE NEEDS TO EXPLAIN ME WHY DO WE KEEP GETTING EXCITED ABOUT FINDING WATER ON MARS WHEN WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH IT IN FEARS OF CONTAMINATING IT OR IS IT JUST WRT TO FUTURE MARS COLONISATION
SO IT IS CONFIRMED NOW THERE IS WATER ON MARS THIS IS GREAT WE COULD NOW SUSTAIN LIFE ON IT CORRECT

WATER ICE CANNOT PERSIST ON THE SURFACE OF MARS TODAY IT SUBLIMES INTO WATER VAPOR IN THE PLANET'S THIN DRY ATMOSPHERE THE UTOPIA DEPOSIT IS SHIELDED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE BY A SOIL COVERING ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT TO FEET TO METERS THICK

JUST METER SOIL I DONT KNOW THAT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE REAL IM STILL HYPED
DON'T START COMPARING IT TO MEXICO OR SOMEONE'S GONNA BUILD A WALL
GOOD THING TRUMP DOESN'T BELIEVE IN SCIENCE WE WON'T BE BOTHERED BY SPECTACLES SUCH AS THESE ANYMORE
GOOD THING THEY DIDN'T FIND ANY PORN THERE OR THE U KING WOULD HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT
OK I KNOW THE ACTUAL NEWS IS REAL BUT IS THE REGISTER A REAL NEWS SITE
DELETED
EVERY 2 DAYS THEY FIND WATER AND LIFE ON MARS BY NOW YOU CAN SWIM OVER THERE
WOULD I LIKE TO SEE MORE LUNAR LANDINGS CERTAINLY

BUT NOT AT THE COST OF HAVING TO GIVE UP ANY MARS MISSIONS



ALSO LANDING TECHNIQUES ON THE MOON HAVE VERY LITTLE IN COMMON WITH LANDING ON MARS GRAVITY ATMOSPHERE FACTORS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

LIKEWISE LIVING OFF THE MOON WOULD ALSO BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN LIVING OFF MARS DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING PROXIMITY TO EARTH AND ALSO RAW MATERIALS AVAILABLE



AS FOR THE MORE GENERAL QUESTION THE MOON OR MARS WHICH SHOULD WE CHOOSE

I'VE BEEN DEBATING THAT WITH MYSELF FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW

ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES ABOUT THE MOON THAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT IS THE DUST FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS THE SURFACE HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY AND STEADILY STRUCK WITH IMPACTS SINCE THERE IS NO ATMOSPHERE TO STOP THE TINIEST OF LITTLE METEORS THESE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN CEASELESSLY CONTINUOUSLY PULVERIZING THE DUST INTO FINER AND EVER FINER PARTICLES

THERE IS NO WIND OR WEATHER ON THE MOON TO WASH OR SWEEP AWAY THE DUST

THIS DUST IS SO THAT IT CAUSED LUNG PROBLEMS FOR THE APOLLO ASTRONAUTS EVEN DURING THEIR VERY SHORT STAYS AND IT ALSO PENETRATED INTO MOST OF THE EQUIPMENT

IT IS THOUGHT THAT LONGER STAYS ON THE MOON MAY RESULT IN LUNG CANCER VERY READILY PERHAPS I GUESS THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO REALLY FIND OUT

MARS DUST ISN'T ANYWHERE NEAR AS PROBLEMATIC AS LUNAR DUST BUT HOPEFULLY IT WILL TURN OUT TO BE EASIER THAN ANTICIPATED TO DEAL WITH LUNAR DUST AS I PERSONALLY WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE PERMANENT BASES ON THE MOON AS WELL AS MARS

HARD VACUUM AND LESS GRAVITY WE WON'T PROVE OR LEARN MUCH WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT IN LEO AND ON EARTH REENTRY
MARS IS A FUCKING ARSEHOLE

IT'S ATMOSPHERE IS THICK ENOUGH THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE HEAT SHIELDS FOR THE COMPRESSION BUT NOT THICK ENOUGH TO DO A GOOD JOB OF SLOWING THE CRAFT DOWN

IT'S THE KIDS POOL OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
NOP WE SHOULD DO MORE LANDINGS ON EARTH SINCE THE GRAVITY AND ATMOSPHERE OF MARS IS MORE SIMILAR TO EARTH THAN THE MOON
THEY CAN RECYCLE IT AND USE IT AS FERTILIZER AND A GROWING MEDIUM FOR SPACE FARMING
GENERATE USEABLE METHANE AND LET THE LEFTOVERS BURN UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE
THEY SHOULD TALK TO SURFERS THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS PROBLEM FOR A LONG TIME
SOURCE THAT LOOKS LIKE THE PARACHUTE AND HEAT SHIELD NOT THE IMPACT SITE

EDIT YEAH THIS IS NOT THE CRASH SITE THAT IS THE PARACHUTE AND HEAT SHIELD

THE TOP IMAGE IS THE CRASH SITE
SO WAS IT BASICALLY A LANDING I DON'T SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF SCATTER SKID OR DEBRIS
I WOULD HATE TO SEE STIR FRIDAY IN A ZERO G ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD BE TERRIFYING

OH DEAR I REMEMBER THE ROCKET WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE FLYING INSTEAD OF SELF DESTRUCTING THUS CRASHING RIGHT INTO A VILLAGE WHEN THE AUTHORITARIAN REGIME VALUES A SUCCESS MORE THAN HUMAN LIVES
VERY SAD THIS WAS PROBABLY THE WORST TRAGEDY IN HUMAN SPACE PROGRAM HISTORY
FUNNY THING IS LONG MARCH IS NOW THE WORKHORSE OF THE CHINESE FLEET
SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT REACTING IN THIS WAY JUST BECAUSE THE IMU GIVES YOU CLEARLY BAD DATA AT ONE POINT THEY SAY THE ALTITUDE WAS INDICATED AS NEGATIVE IS A CLEAR SIGN OF SEVERE QA PROBLEMS THIS SCREAMS LACK OF CODE REVIEWS MIXED VIRTUAL REAL SYSTEM TESTING UNIT TESTING AND SMELLS OF ORGANIZATIONAL NEGLECT OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

I AM STILL CONFUSED IT SAYS THE IMU MAXED OUT SURELY THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EASY THING TO PREDICT UNLESS IT WAS ACCELERATING DECELERATING MUCH MUCH FASTER THAN EXPECTED
THE COMPUTER SHOULD BE PROGRAMMED WITH A NOMINAL PROFILE OF WHAT TO EXPECT DURING BDL AND JUST COMPARE IT TO THE REALITY SO IF REALITY IS TOO OFF JUST DISCARD THAT DATA AND START AGAIN

MEN FROM EARTH BY BUZZ ALDRIN

IT IS THE STORY OF THE SPACE RACE STARTING FROM THE END OF WW2 TO APOLLO RETURN TO EARTH ALL FROM PERSPECTIVE IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING READ AS THE TECHNICAL JARGON OF INDIVIDUAL MOTOR ADVANCEMENTS EXPERIMENTAL VEHICLES WERE BALANCED BY ACCOUNTS OF WORKING HIS WAY UP FROM THE AIR FORCE TO TEST PILOT TO ASTRONAUTICS THERE IS ALSO A GREAT DEAL IN THE BOOK ABOUT THE RUSSIAN'S SIDE OF THE SPACE RACE WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING TO READ PERSPECTIVE ON AS THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MUTUAL RESPECT MEN FROM EARTH IS DEFINITELY A MORE TECHNICAL LESSON AS OPPOSED TO AN EMOTIONAL ACCOUNT SPIRITUAL ASSESSMENT OF BEING ON THE MOON WHICH MIGHT TURN SOME READERS AWAY BUT FOR YOUR CURIOSITIES I THINK IT WOULD BE A PERFECT BOOK TO READ
TOPIC

OH WAIT I THOUGHT YOU SAID A FEW MONTHS
THE CASE FOR MARS BY ROBERT SUBERIN IT'S BOTH TECHNICAL AND PASSIONATE AND COVERS IN DETAIL TECHNOLOGY TO BUILD AND USE TO GET ROCKETS WITH HUMANS TO MARS AND BACK TO PRODUCE FUEL OXYGEN METAL GLASS ON MARS SURVIVING HABITATS FOOD REALLY A FASCINATING READ FROM A PASSIONATE WRITER
THANKS FOR THE TIP WILL BUY ONLINE FOR TODAY
FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION BY GENE KRANZ YES THE GUY ED HARRIS PORTRAYED IN APOLLO
I KNOW ITS A MOVIE NOW BY I REALLY ENJOYED THE MARTIAN BY ANDY WEIR
THE MOVIE WAS GOOD BUT THE BOOK WAS BETTER STRANDED ON MARS YOU GUYS KNOW THE PREMISE
FIRST LINE I M PRETTY MUCH FUCKED THAT S MY CONSIDERED OPINION FUCKED
THE THING ABOUT THE ION THRUSTERS IS THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO CARRY SOME PROPELLANT SINCE YOU CAN'T GENERATE MORE PROPELLANT IT WILL EVENTUALLY RUN OUT THE EM DRIVE IS SO CRAZY BECAUSE IT ONLY USES ELECTRICITY WHICH CAN BE GENERATED BY NUCLEAR OR SOLAR IN A STAR SYSTEM MEANS AND THEORETICALLY WILL NOT RUN OUT

OF COURSE THE ION THRUSTER IS CURRENTLY BETTER THAN THE EM DRIVE AS WE HAVE HAD IONS FOR ABOUT OR SO YEARS NOW THE SCIENTISTS WERE ALSO WORKING ON THE CONCEPT FOR AROUND OR SO YEARS BEFORE THEY HAD A WORKING PROTOTYPE THE EM DRIVE HAS BEEN OUT FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS ONLY TIME WILL TELL IF THE THEORIES TURN OUT TO BE RIGHT OR NOT

ALSO RELEVANT XKCD
IF MY INVENTION LEADS YOU TO AN INVENTION TIMES BETTER HOW IS MINE USELESS
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK UP WHAT USELESS MEANS CIRC THE EM DRIVE PRODUCES MORE THRUST THAN SOLAR SAILS WHICH ARE CONSIDERED USEFUL

I ALSO WONDER HOW IF THE EM DRIVE WILL BE IMPROVED UPON
IF ANY DEVIATION FROM CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM CAN BE FOUND IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS CAN BE SCALED UP AND IMPROVED ONCE THE MECHANISM IS UNDERSTOOD SUPERCONDUCTING CAVITIES WOULD BE AN OBVIOUS APPROACH ALTHOUGH IT IS UNCLEAR IF A BETTER Q-FACTOR WOULD INCREASE THRUST PER POWER MAYBE ENERGY LOSS AND THRUST ARE DIRECTLY CONNECTED

THE FIRST ROCKETS WERE NOT USEFUL EITHER AND THE FIRST COMPUTER RAM WAS PRODUCED BIT BY BIT MANUALLY
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WELL WHAT THE EM DRIVE IMPLY
EVEN THO IT IS LESS EFFICIENT THAN THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY PROPELLANT
AND ACCELERATION TIME IS THE DERIVATIVE OF SPEED TIME MEANING THAT FOR A CONSTANT ACCELERATION AS SMALL AS IT IS YOU GET A POWER 2 SPEED TIME FUNCTION

THE PROBLEM WITH CURRENT MEANS OF PROPULSION IS THAT ONCE IN SPACE YOU CAN NOT INDEFINITIVELY ACCELERATE YOU RUN OUT OF FUEL BUT WITH AN EM DRIVE YOU COULD FOR EXAMPLE USE ATOMIC ENERGY SOLAR ENERGY FOR PROPULSION WICH WE CURRENTLY CAN'T EXCEPT FOR SOLAR SAILS
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE TOOK A ROCKET FALCON BEFORE TAKE OFF AND YOU GOT IT TO IT'S RELEASE RATE YOU'D GET A SPEED OF T 2 RELEASE RATE M S WITH T ELAPSED TIME IN SECONDS

OF COURSE IT WOULD MEAN A LOT OF POWER ALL WE NEED IS TO DEVELOP MORE EFFICIENT POWER SOURCES

PS SORRY IF IT DOES NOT SOUND CLEAR BUT MY ENGLISH IS NOT THE BEST
YOUR EXAMPLE HAS A DESIRE TO PROVIDE G OF THRUST IN SPACE IF YOU LET THE ENGINE RUN CONSTANTLY YOUR ACCELERATION REQUIREMENTS DON'T NEED TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT HIGH TO GET AROUND YOU HAVE LOTS MORE TIME IN SPACE FOR AN ENGINE THAT CAN GENERATE CONSTANT THRUST

IMAGINE POTENTIAL USES AS LAME AS SATELLITE ORBIT STABILIZATION THIS DRIVE WOULD BE GREAT FOR THAT IMAGINE IF WE COULD DEORBIT EVERY DECOMMISSIONED SATELLITE EVEN IF THEY'VE RUN OUT OF FUEL MAYBE WE COULD USE THE DRIVE TO BLEED OFF ENERGY FROM REACTION WHEEL SYSTEMS PERHAPS INCREASING THEIR LONGEVITY
YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS DOCUMENT
FILE D VIEW
THERE'S NO POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THRUST AND POWER INTO THE SYSTEM

HOLDING OUT UNTIL THERE'S SOME MORE DATA HERE
RELATIONLESS THRUST THE CONTENTIONAL IF YOU CAN SCALE IT UP IS INCREDIBLE
IN MANY POSTS YOU COMMENTED ON THE FEASIBILITY OF SOLAR SAILS MORE PROVEN LESS EXPERIMENTAL AN EM DRIVE AND A SOLAR SAIL HAS THE SAME PURPOSE LONG DISTANCE TRAVEL

A SOLAR SAIL IS VERY FRAIL AND DIFFICULT TO PIECE TOGETHER AS IT IS SO TERRIBLY THIN IT TRANSFERS A DECENT AMOUNT OF POWER FROM THE SOLAR WIND THIS POWER SIMPLY DECREASES WITH DISTANCE

AN EM DRIVE MAY NOT PRODUCE MUCH THRUST BUT WHEN IN SPACE WITHOUT DRAG IT HAS LONG RANGE CONSEQUENCES ONCE OUT OF THE RANGE OF OUR SUN'S SOLAR WIND AN EM DRIVE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE

IF EM DRIVES DO TURN OUT TO BE A WORKING SYSTEM I DOUBT THEY WOULD BE USED FOR ANYTHING CLOSER THAN MISSIONS TO THE OUTER PLANETS

TL R
EM DRIVE PROPULSION OVER DISTANCE
SOLAR SAIL PROPULSION CLOSE TO THE SUN

HOPE THAT HELPS
IT'S MUCH EASIER TO GIVE MARS A MAGNETIC FIELD THAN TO GET RID OF OF ATMOSPHERE
VENUS IS ACTUALLY TOO CLOSE TO BE IN THE GOLDILOCKS ZONE OF THE SUN EVEN IN THE OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATE MARS BY COMPARISON IS WITHIN THE HABITABLE ZONE EVEN IN THE PESSIMISTIC ESTIMATE IT ONLY DOESN'T HAVE LIQUID WATER ON ITS SURFACE BECAUSE IT'S ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IS TOO LOW


VENUS DOESN'T HAVE A MAGNETOSPHERE NONE WHATSOEVER THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY VENUS IS THE DRIEST PLACE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM ALL OF THE WATER IN ITS CRUST EVEN WATER CHEMICALLY BOUND TO ROCKS HAS BEEN BAKED OUT BY THE HEAT AND BEEN VAPORIZED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE IT FLOATS UP TO THE TOP AND IS BLASTED AWAY BY SOLAR WIND THIS IS WHY EVEN THOUGH VENUS MAY HAVE HAD OCEANS IN THE PAST IT WILL NEVER HAVE THEM AGAIN THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH WATER VENUS ACTUALLY HAS MORE SULFURIC ACID THAN WATER


TO MAKE VENUS ANYTHING CLOSE TO HABITABLE WE'D HAVE TWO MAIN PROBLEMS TO OVERCOME WE'D NEED TO THIN THE ATMOSPHERE AND LOWER THE TEMPERATURE THE BEST WAY TO DO BOTH WOULD BE TO BUILD A HUGE SUNSHADE BLOCKING OF THE SUNS LIGHT ALLOWING THE TEMPERATURE TO PLUMMET FAST ENOUGH THAT IN A FEW HUNDRED YEARS THE ATMOSPHERE WOULD FREEZE OUT ONCE THE ATMOSPHERE WAS FROZEN WE COULD BUILD MASS DRIVERS AND USE THEM TO FIRE THE FROZEN CARBON DIOXIDE OUT ON AN ESCAPE VELOCITY OF VENUS WHERE THEY'D SUBLIMATE AROUND THE SUN AND NEVER BE ABLE TO RETURN TO VENUS WE'D SEPARATE OUT THE NITROGEN ICE AND STOCKPILE IT FOR LATER DURING THIS PROCESS EVENTUALLY WE WOULD HAVE LAUNCHED ENOUGH INTO SPACE THAT WE COULD ALLOW LIGHT FROM THE SUN TO REHEAT VENUS AND VAPORIZE THE ICES INTO AN ATMOSPHERE MAINLY COMPOSED OF NITROGEN BUT WHICH WOULD STILL CONTAIN A TOXIC AMOUNT OF VENUS AT THIS POINT WOULD HAVE AN AVERAGE TEMPERATURE ABOUT THE SAME AS THE WITH SHALLOW OCEANS OF CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID AND A NITROGEN ATMOSPHERE ABOUT AS THICK AS THE NEXT WE'D HAVE TO DIG UP MILLIONS OF TONS OF FRESH ROCKS FROM UNDERGROUND TO REACT WITH THE ACID UNTIL IT WAS MOSTLY NEUTRALIZED NOW FINALLY WE COULD SEED THE SURFACE WITH PHOTOSYNTHETIC BACTERIA ABLE TO BREAK DOWN THE IN THE ATMOSPHERE INTO OXYGEN AND ONCE ENOUGH OXYGEN BUILT UP WE COULD RELEASE PLANTS AND OTHER FORMS OF LIFE


THIS TERRAFORMED VENUS WOULD ALWAYS REQUIRE A SUNSHADE AND SINCE IT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY VOLCANICALLY ACTIVE WE WOULD NEED TO DEAL WITH LARGE SCALE ERUPTIONS QUITE OFTEN THIS ENTIRE PROCESS WOULD MOST LIKELY TAKE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS AT LEAST BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE EITHER DIVERTING THOUSANDS OF ASTEROIDS OR DELIVERING TRILLIONS OF TONS OF METALLIC CALCIUM OR OTHER EVEN MORE DIFFICULT OPTIONS


THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH VENUS IS THAT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COLONIZE IT UNTIL AT THE EARLIEST THE FROZEN ATMOSPHERE STAGE WHICH REQUIRES US TO BUILD A MASSIVE ORBITING SOLAR SHADE COLONIZING MARS BY COMPARISON COULD BEGIN AS MARS EXISTS CURRENTLY TODAY THERE'S JUST NO WAY THAT MARS COLONIZATION COULD TAKE AS LONG OR BE AS DIFFICULT AS VENUS COLONIZATION
I SAW SOMETHING A WHILE AGO THAT SUGGESTED FLYING HABITS FOR VENUS THAT WOULD MAKE USE OF GRAVITY AND THE MAGNETOSPHERE WHILE AVOIDING THE HAZARDS OF BEING BELOW THE CLOUD LINE IT WAS JUST AN IDEA THOUGH
VENUS COULD BE A CANDIDATE FOR FLOATING CITIES THE REGION OF IT'S ATMOSPHERE WITH A PRESSURE OF ATM HAS A TEMPERATURE SIMILAR TO EARTH
TH TEMPERATURE IS RISING BY A FEW DEGREES AND THE LEVEL IS RISING BY A FRACTION OF A PERCENT ALL THE WORLD'S PEOPLE SEEM TO BE HELPLESS TO ALTER THOSE ISSUES

AND YET WE TALK ABOUT TERAFORMING A PLANET EITHER CREATING OR REPLACING AN ENTIRE ATMOSPHERE JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY MADE UP A WORD DOESN'T MEAN IT'S POSSIBLE
ASK THIS CHICK I'D ASSUME SHE KNOWS A THING OR TWO
SYMBOLISM SPACE SUITS DON'T ALLOW FOR IDENTIFICATION OF GENDER IT WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY TWO UNISEX PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS UNLESS ARTISTIC LIBERTIES ARE TAKEN IN THE STATUES

GENDER EQUALITY THE SEX OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO TAKES THE FIRST STEPS IS IRRELEVANT TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT DISMISSING THE YEARS OF SCHOOLING HARD WORK AND TRAINING AND REDUCING THAT PERSON TO THIER SEX IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE THEIR GENDER HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT IT COULD ALSO BE SAID THAT HE SHE WAS JUST THERE AS PROPAGANDA AND DIDN'T EARN IT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF A MAN OR A WOMAN IS FIRST THE MESSAGE SHOULD BE ABOUT THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS NOT GENDER

BURDEN IS THERE REALLY A BURDEN OF BEING THE FIRST I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT IS SO OVER BURDENING THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR SOMEONE TO EXPERIENCE IT WITH THEM

SHARING THE WEALTH I ALSO DON'T SEE THIS AS A HUGE PROBLEM ALL OF THEM WOULD BE INFAMOUS TO A DEGREE TAKE A BAND FOR EXAMPLE THIER FANS ALL KNOW THE FRONT MAN BUT NOT AS MANY KNOW THE DRUMMER SURE THERE ARE SOME ISSUES CAUSED BY THAT IN SOME BANDS BUT NOT SO MUCH THAT MOST BANDS ARE HINDERED HOW WOULD MORAL BE AFFECTED BY KNOWING ONE PERSON IS THERE AS A PUBLICITY STUNT

TO BE TRULY EQUAL GENDER SHOULDN'T BE FACTORED INTO THE DECISION OF WHO IS THE FIRST IF IT'S A MAN IT SHOULDN'T BE INTERPRETED AS A SLIGHT AGAINST WOMEN AND CONVERSELY A WOMAN SHOULDN'T BE THOUGHT OF AS A SLIGHT AGAINST MEN OR A GIMMICK EVEN THIS DISCUSSION SHOULDN'T BE TAKING PLACE BUT EVEN TODAY WE LIKE TO REDUCE PEOPLE TO THEIR REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AND ATTRIBUTE THE GRAVITY OF THIER ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO THAT I CAN'T STAND THAT ONCE SOMETHING IS DONE IT'S NEWS AGAIN IF SOMEONE OF THE OPPOSITE GENDER DOES IT GENDER IS NOT A FUCKING HANDICAP THAT IS DESERVING OF ADDITIONAL ACCOLADES
ALSO IT SHOULD BE A SMALL SPIRALLING WATER SLIDE NOT AN EXIT RAMP OR POLE
NUMBER ONE PERSON REPRESENTING HUMANITY A HUMAN THAT'S EVERYTHING WE SHOULD SEE WHEN WE GET TO MARS FOR THE FIRST TIME
GENDER EQUALITY

YOU KNOW THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF FOLKS THAT DEEM GENDER EQUALITY MEANS A LOT MORE THAN TWO RIGHT THE MOMENT YOU OPEN A CAN OR WORMS LIKE THIS YOU'VE END UP CATERING TO EVERY NONSENSICAL NOTION BEING TOUTED

A PERSON WILL LAND ON MARS AND BE THE FIRST I HONESTLY DON'T CARE IF IT A MAN OR A WOMAN SO LONG AS THEY GET THERE AND RETURN SAFELY TO THE EARTH
YEAH BUT IMAGINE THE LOGISTIC PAIN IN THE ASS OF TRYING TO DESCEND A LADDER IN A ENVIRONMENTAL SUIT HAND IN HAND
HOW ABOUT WE DON'T POLLUTE ANOTHER PLANET BY SPENDING ALL OF OUR TIME THINKING ABOUT WHO HAS WHICH GENITALS AND HOW THAT MAKES THEM FEEL

THERE ARE BETTER THINGS WE COULD BE DOING


WHO GIVES A FUCK MAN MADE IT TO MARS I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S ALL PEOPLE WOULD CARE ABOUT ONLY PEOPLE LIKE YOU THINK THIS WAY
NICE THOUGHTS BUT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED HOW UPSET THE WILL BE IN THESE DAYS OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS WE NEED SIX PEOPLE TOUCHING THE GROUND IN THE EXACT SAME MILLISECOND TO PLEASE EVERYONE

WAIT I FORGOT THE BLACKS HISPANICS INBITS ABORIGINALS VEGETARIANS LEFTHANDED FAR SIGHTED AMPUTEES

THIS WILL STILL NOT PLEASE EVERYONE
PEOPLE SHOULD STOP GIVING SO MUCH IMPORTANCE ABOUT GENDER THE FIRST PERSON ON MARS BEING MALE OR FEMALE IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT OF REACHING ANOTHER PLANET HOW YOU CAN EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS THING IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND FOR ME
YEAH WHY IT'S AN PLANETARY LANDING NOT A WEDDING MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE A FLOWER GIRL TOO
OK BUT FIRST THEY HAVE TO SPEND SEVERAL DECADES AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGURE OUT WHICH RACE SEX COMBINATION IS GOING TO MAKE THE MOST PEOPLE HAPPY LEAST PEOPLE ANGRY

THEN YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE ALL RACES RELIGIONS AND VIEWS OF SCI-FI TV

THE FACT A HUMAN IS STEPPING FOOT ON ANOTHER PLANET SHOULD BE BIGGER THAN WHOEVER ACTUALLY MADE THAT GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND
I'VE SEEN THAT MOVIE BEFORE DOCKING INSERTION AND INJECTION ALL MEANT SOMETHING WAY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I WAS EXPECTING FROM A SPACE MISSION

I DON'T THINK NASA REALLY HAD A TIGHT CONTROL ON THE CONTENT OF THAT DOCUMENTARY
THE IDEA THAT WOMEN ARE JUST AS ADVENTUROUS AND JUST AS INTERESTED IN JOBS THAT CARRY HIGH RISKS IS A FICTION PEDDLED BY THE LEFT WHILE THIS MAY SYMBOLIZE THAT FICTION AND YOU COULD CERTAINLY FIND A WOMAN TO DO IT IT WOULD ONLY BE USEFUL TO FURTHER ADVANCE THE LIE THAT WOMEN ARE THE SAME AS MEN THEY ARE NOT IT'S TYPICALLY MEN WHO DO DANGEROUS THINGS BECAUSE THAT'S OUR EVOLUTIONARY AND SOCIAL ROLE IF YOU WANT TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF ILLUSION REGARDING SEX AND GENDER YOU CAN BUT DON'T PRETEND IT REFLECTS REALITY
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE HE OR SHE IT SHOULD BE HE AND SHE

TRIGGERED ASSUMING THE ASTRONAUTS GENDER LIKE THAT WHY NOT A NONBINARY GENDERFLUID AUTIGENDER WHILE WE ARE AT IT
THERE SHOULDN'T BE A FIRST WHITE MAN ON THE MOON THEY SHOULD INCLUDE EVERY RACE AND SHOULD ALL JOIN HANDS IN A HUGE CIRCLE WHILE TAKING THE FIRST STEPS TO REPRESENT HOW HUMANITIES DESTINY IS TO BE INTEGRATED BEYOND EARTH

NUMBER
SOMEHOW THIS COMMENT THREAD IS FULL OF HATE I THINK THIS IS A LOVELY IDEA LOGISTICALLY IT MIGHT NOT BE FEASIBLE TO PULL OFF OF COURSE SOMEONE MADE A GOOD POINT ABOUT TWO PEOPLE CLIMBING DOWN A LADDER BUT YOUR POINTS ARE SPOT ON
WE'RE GONNA SEE WHATEVER ANYONE WHO'S USING THE MOUSE CURSOR WILL SHOW US WHETHER IT'S A FACE ON A ROCK OR A MACHINE PART OR WHAT HAVE YOU I WATCHED THIS ON MUTE AND I FOUND SO MANY MORE THINGS THERE WHAT BECAUSE OF THE SHADOWS AND THE MYRIAD OF NATURAL SHAPES IT'S JUST A JUGGERNAUT OF RICKS IS WHAT THAT IS
IT'S OUR BRAIN TRY TO FIND THINGS THAT COULD BE PREDATORS NO ANOMALIES HERE
I REALLY HOPE THERE WILL BE MORE MISSION AND EVEN SUICIDE PROBE TO LEAR MORE ABOUT THE SUN AFTER ALL IF WE WANT TO MAKE FUSION REACTOR HERE WE SHOULD LEARN ABOUT THE BIGGEST ONE IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
I KNOW IT'LL PROBABLY NEVER BE REALISED NOR WOULD IT BE A BETTER IDEA BUT THE NAUTILUS X WOULD BE WAY COOLER THAN SPACE ITS
IT REMINDS ME OF THIS DOCUMENTARY IN FRENCH

WATCH V SOFJHEX
I LIKE THE IDEA FOR MARS COMING LAST OFCOURSE I'D LOVE TO SEE HUMANS GO TO ANY OTHER PLANET I JUST DON'T FIND MARS NEARLY AS INTERESTING AS SOME OTHER PLANETS ESPECIALLY VENUS
I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE THIS HERE

MARS IN DAYS

IN ORDER TO CONDUCT A MANNED TRIP TO MARS IN JUST DAYS THE CASIMIR WOULD REQUIRE AN ELECTRICAL POWER LEVEL DELIVERED ONLY BY NUCLEAR PROPULSION SPECIFICALLY THE NUCLEAR ELECTRIC TYPE BY WAY OF NUCLEAR POWER IN SPACE THIS KIND OF NUCLEAR FISSION REACTOR MIGHT USE A TRADITIONAL RANKINE BRAYTON STIRLING CONVERSION ENGINE SUCH AS THAT USED BY THE SAFE REACTOR BRAYTON CYCLE OR THE DUFF KILOPOWER REACTOR STIRLING CYCLE TO CONVERT HEAT TO ELECTRICITY HOWEVER THE VEHICLE MIGHT BE BETTER SERVED WITH PARTS AND BASED POWER CONVERSION USING A THERMOCELL TECHNOLOGY OF THE THERMOELECTRIC INCLUDING THERMAL POWER CONVERSION PYROELECTRIC THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC THERMIONIC MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC TYPE THERMOELECTRIC MATERIALS ARE ALSO OPTION FOR CONVERTING HEAT ENERGY BEING BOTH RADIATION AND THE KINETIC THERMAL VIBRATION OF MOLECULES AND OTHER PARTICLES TO ELECTRIC CURRENT ENERGY ELECTRONS FLOWING THROUGH A CIRCUIT AVOIDING THE NEED FOR SIZED RADIATORS SUBERIN QUOTE FOR A KILOWATT MEGAWATT REACTOR WITH A DENSITY OF WATTS PER KILOGRAM DIAZ QUOTE THIS REACTOR WOULD REQUIRE EFFICIENT WASTE HEAT CAPTURING TECHNOLOGY FOR COMPARISON A FAST ATTACK SUBMARINE USES A MEGAWATT REACTOR AND THE PILGRIM NUCLEAR GENERATING STATION USES A MEGAWATT REACTOR WIKI
WAIT WHY DO THEY LIST MERCURY AS A SOURCE OF HELIUM BUT NOT THE MOON WHICH IS RIGHT AT OUR DOORSTEP
SUMMIT OLYMPUS MONS CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I DON'T THINK IT'D BE PARTICULARLY HARD ASIDE FROM THE GETTING TO MARS BIT IT'S NOT VERY STEEP SO IT WOULD BE A FAIRLY EASY IF VERY LONG WALK
MPH NONE OF THAT INTERESTS ME HUMANS TO THE ASTEROIDS AND THE MOON AND NEW MISSIONS TO THE GAS GIANTS ARE WHERE ITS AT

THERE ARE A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT BLACK HOLES PARTICULARLY GIVEN ITS NOT SOMETHING WE GET TO STUDY UP CLOSE

FOR A START THEY ARE NOT HOLES NO RIP IN THE SPACE TIME CONTINUUM NO FAST TRAVEL TO DISTANT STARS SORRY YOU'RE THINKING OF WORMHOLES DIFFERENT THING

SO TECHNICALLY YOU CAN'T GO INSIDE ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN GO INSIDE A PLANET

2 THEY ARE NOT BLACK THEY APPEAR BLACK BECAUSE THE ESCAPING LIGHT YES LIGHT ESCAPES FROM BLACK HOLES IS THE WAVES ARE LITERALLY STRETCHED BEYOND THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM

AS TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO NEAR THEM YOU GET STRETCHED

THE BIT OF YOU CLOSEST GET PULLED TOWARDS IT SO MUCH MORE THAN THE BIT OF YOU FURTHEST AWAY THAT YOU BECOME LIKE STRING
A BLACK HOLE ISN'T ACTUALLY A HOLE BUT RATHER AN EXTREMELY DENSE CELESTIAL BODY THE SHEER AMOUNT OF FORCE PULLING YOU IN WOULD MAKE FOR SOME INTERESTING SPACE-TIME EFFECTS BUT MORE IMMEDIATELY YOU'D SIMPLY DIE AN INSTANT MESSY DEATH BY BEING STRETCHED AND RIPPED APART BY GRAVITY

ONCE INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE YOUR BODY ALONG WITH YOUR SPACESHIP PRESUMABLY WOULD BE COMPRESSED INTO A WIDE BUT VERY FLAT MASS ON THE SURFACE OF THE BODY AND THUS BECOME PART OF IT
YOUR BODY WOULD UNDERGO SPAGHETTIFICATION OR THE NOODLE EFFECT THIS IS WHERE THE BODY IS STRETCHED SO FAR VERTICALLY BECAUSE OF THE PULL THAT IT APPEARS SKINNY AND STRETCHED OUT HENCE THE NAME SPAGHETTI SURELY SOMEONE CAN EXPLAIN BETTER THEN ME ALL I KNOW IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO A PERSON
I LOVE WATCHING ALL THE DIFFERENT SPACE VIDEOS AVAILABLE BUT WHY DO THE PRESENTERS ALWAYS TALK ABOUT BLACK HOLES AS IF THEY WERE DISCOVERED LAST MONTH AND THE AUDIENCE HAS HARDLY HEARD OF THEM WHY DO THEY CALL BLACK HOLES STRANGE WHEN WE HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THEM FOR AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS
WHAT KIND OF IMU WAS IT DID THEY DO ANY ROBUSTNESS TESTING AT ALL
IT'S HARD TO GRASP THE FACT THAT THERE'S A METAL THING FLOATING SO FAR AWAY FROM US FREELY IN SPACE AND MOST PROBABLY WILL THE LIFE ON EARTH
THAT'S THE MEASUREMENT I USE TO TELL PEOPLE HOW FAR AWAY I AM WHEN I'M LATE HEY I'M E AWAY BY THE TIME THEY FIGURE IT OUT I WILL PROBABLY STILL BE LATE


ARE WE IGNORING THE FACT VOYAGER 2 IS THE FURTHEST OBJECT ON TWITTER
ITS DATA PLAN HAS TO DRAIN NASA BUDGET SERIOUSLY
ONE DAY MANKIND WILL BE ABLE TO TRAVEL FAST ENOUGH THROUGH SPACE TO EVENTUALLY RETRIEVE VOYAGER 2
THAT'S ABOUT LIGHT YEARS AWAY IT WOULD TAKE THE ENTERPRISE D ABOUT SECONDS AT WARP TOP SPEED TO REACH VOYAGER 2 FOR COMPARISON THE USS VOYAGER WOULD TAKE ABOUT SECONDS AT WARP TO REACH ITS NAMESAKE
CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN THAT TIMESTAMP TO ME OBVIOUSLY I GET THE PART BUT THE REST WHATS WITH THE
HOURS AWAY AND IT'S AT THE EDGE OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO HAVE MANNED EXPLORATION LIGHT SPEED IS TOO SLOW
I WAS IN 7TH GRADE WHEN IT LEFT EARTH I REMEMBER THINKING ABOUT WHAT MY LIFE MIGHT BE LIKE AS THE MARKERS PASSED

PASSING JUPITER WOW I WILL BE A FRESHMAN I WAS

PASSING SATURN I'LL BE A JUNIOR AND HAVE A GIRLFRIEND NOPE

PASSING URANUS INSERT JOKE HERE

PASSING NEPTUNE I WILL BE A MAN AND PROBABLY BE WORKING I WAS ALSO MARRIED

LEAVING THE SOLAR SYSTEM I'LL PROBABLY BE DEAD I'M NOT ALSO DIVORCED

REACHES PROXIMA CENTAURI MY SPECIES WILL BE EXTINCT PLEASE ADD NOTE IN YEARS

REALLY MAKES YOU THINK ABOUT HOW TINY WE ARE IN THIS UNIVERSE THE FURTHEST OBJECT IS LESS THAN HOURS AWAY AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WE AS A SPECIES HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN AND SO MUCH TO SEE I AM EXCITED FOR THE FUTURE
ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT WAY TO PUT THE VOYAGERS DISTANCE IN PERSPECTIVE IF THE MILKY WAY WAS THE SIZE OF A QUARTER THE VOYAGERS WOULD STILL BE INSIDE THE FIRST ATOM
I SAW THE TWITTER HANDLE AND IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT NOT SAFE FOR WORK

NOT SAFE FOR VACUUMS

EDIT SPACE IS A VACUUM I'M DUMB
FOR A MINUTE I THOUGHT THAT VOYAGER 2 WAS LITERALLY SENDING TWEETS USING IT'S TRANSMITTER UNTIL I THOUGHT WOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A WASTE OF ENERGY

I'M DUMB
IF THROUGH HUMAN NON HUMAN OR NATURAL PROCESSES HUMANITY DOES NOT SURVIVE OUR SPACE PROBES LIKE VOYAGER WILL STAND AS A TESTAMENT FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS MAKING ONE VERY PROFOUND STATEMENT

FOR AT LEAST ONE MOMENT IN OUR SHORT HISTORY WE OVER CAME ASTOUNDING OBSTACLES AND ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE ODDS AND PROJECTED OUR INHERENT CURIOSITY AND NEED FOR DISCOVERY IN TO THE UNIVERSE
WOW THEY WERE SO FORWARD THINKING TO INSTALL THE TWITTER APP ON IT IN THE
ANYONE KNOW HOW LONG IT'LL TAKE TO BE AN ENTIRE LIGHT YEAR FROM EARTH

EDIT SO AROUND YEARS THANKS FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTION YOU R SPACE GUYS ARE NICE

MY DAD WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE NUCLEAR GENERATOR THAT POWERS VOYAGER PIONEER AND APOLLO
LIKES FOR THIS TWEET BUT IF A KARDASHIAN TWEETED WHAT SHOES SHE'S WEARING FOR THE DAY THE INTERNET BREAKS HUMANS SUCK

LINK TO ORIGINAL TWEET IF YOU FANCY ATING
NSFVOYAGER 2 STATUS
SOME SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT THE EVENTS OF HAVE ACTUALLY FURTHER ACCELERATED THE SPACECRAFT AWAY FROM THE SOLAR SYSTEM
EITHER LIGHT IS REALLY SLOW OR SPACE IS REALLY VAST MY BRAIN WANTS TO DEFAULT TO BELIEVING LIGHT IS REALLY SLOW BECAUSE IT JUST CANNOT FATHOM THE DISTANCES INVOLVED

WE LEARN ABOUT OUR SOLAR SYSTEM FROM AN EARLY AGE BUT WE ARE SHOWN MODELS WHICH BUILD THIS MAP IN OUR MINDS OF A LOCAL BACKYARD OF PLANETS THE REALITY IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM IS STAGGERING

THE ONLY WAY I CAN REALLY ATTEMPT TO MAKE SENSE OF IT IS BY COMPARING TO DISTANCE ON EARTH IT TAKES ME MINUTES TO TRAVEL TO WORK BY BIKE THAT'S MILES

VOYAGER IS OUT PAST PLUTO PLUTO AT ITS CLOSEST IS BILLION MILES BILLION KM FROM EARTH FOR ME TO TRAVEL THAT DISTANCE I'D BE CYCLING FOR THE NEXT YEARS
PRETTY AMAZING IT HAS WIFI ALL THE WAY OUT THERE VERY IMPRESSIVE STUFF WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT
HOW MUCH DOES THIS VARY BASED ON THE CURRENT POSITION OF THE PLANET SURELY A GRAPH OF ITS DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE PLANET OVER TIME HAS A SINUSOIDAL WAVE TO IT
DON'T KNOW WHY BUT FIND IT STRANGELY COMFORTING THINKING ABOUT THIS GUY ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
STATE OF THE INTERNET WHEN THIS WAS LAUNCHED
NASA CAN TALK TO A PROBE LIGHT HOURS AWAY AND I CAN BARELY GET WIFI SIGNAL IN MY BEDROOM
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SCIENTIFIC PURPOSE IT'D HAVE BUT I'D LOVE FOR SOMEONE TO BUILD A SPACECRAFT WITH A YEAR LIFESPAN HUGE RTG OR MAYBE A REACTOR A HUGE ANTENNA POWERFUL TRANSMITTER AND SEND IT SOMEWHERE ON A REALLY FAST COURSE LIKE DIRECTION IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN SPEED SO IF WE CAN GET SOME REALLY GOOD GRAVITY ASSISTS TOWARDS A LESS INTERESTING DIRECTION THAT'S FINE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE UPPER LIMIT IS DUE TO THE ROCKET PARADOX OR WHATEVER IT'S CALLED BUT I'D LOVE TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE GOT A CRAFT TO DOUBLE THE SPEED OR MORE OF VOYAGER I'M SURE WE'D FIND OUR REALLY INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT DEEP INTERSTELLAR SPACE AND EVEN IF NOT IT'D BE VERY COOL TO LISTEN TO A SPACECRAFT YEARS OLD IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
PROBABLY COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW YOUNG SPACE PROBES THESE DAYS ARE LAZY
I KNOW IT'LL BE SOME YEARS FROM NOW BUT I'M CURIOUS WHEN VOYAGER 2 EVENTUALLY MEETS UP WITH ANOTHER STAR WILL IT WAKE UP AGAIN OR IS IT DOOMED TO BE SILENT FOREVER WHEN IT LOSES POWER FROM BEING TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE SUN
WHY HAVE WE STOPPED SENDING THOSE

WE SHOULD BE SENDING THOSE IN ALL DIRECTIONS MORE MODERN VERSIONS EVERY FEW YEARS WITH BETTER OPTICS RADIOS AND TRY LASER COMMUNICATION

WHY HAVE WE STOPPED DREAMING
SO THIS THING IS MILES AWAY FROM BEING THE FURTHEST IT HAS EVER BEEN FROM THE PLANET AND STILL CAN COMMUNICATE WITH HOUSTON I ENTER THE ELEVATOR AND THE PHONE GOES DEAD BRUSLY
WON'T BE LONG NOW JUUUUUST A LITTLE BIT FARTHER AND ITS CAMERA SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MOM COMPLETELY IN FRAME
NO IT HRS MINS SECONDS OF LIGHT TRAVEL AWAY FROM EARTH HRS MINS SECONDS BEFORE THIS WAS TWEETED
BUT THAT DISTANCE SO FAR SO MANY MILES SO MANY PEE BREAKS IN NOT GREAT AREAS

FIRST CONTACT LITTLE GREEN MEN FIND VOYAGER 2 BRING IT BACK AND SAY KEEP YOUR FUCKING TRASH OUT OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
MAYBE WE NEED A VOYAGER THAT SUPPORTS AND ADMI IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES
OH MY GOD WASNT THIS SENT OUT IN THE S HOLY SHIT ITS MOVING SO SLOW
YEAH YEAH YEAH BUT IS THAT FROM WHEN YOU SENT THE MESSAGE OR WHEN WE RECEIVED IT
WHAT I OFTEN WONDER IS WILL WE EVER BUILD A PROBE OR SPACECRAFT WITH PROPULSION THAT WILL BE ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH IT IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME
I HAVE AND ALWAYS WILL LOVE THINKING ABOUT SPACE TO THINK ABOUT JUST HOW TINY WE ARE COMPARED TO THE UNIVERSE I'M AND I KNOW IN MY LIFETIME WE WILL NEVER PHYSICALLY EXPLORE THE COSMOS BUT IT IS AMAZING TO THINK ONE DAY MAN WILL BE SOMEWHERE ELSE OR EVEN TO EVEN THINK ABOUT MEETING ANOTHER HUMAN LIKE SPECIES OUT THERE WHICH WILL FOREVER CHANGE THE WAY WE LOOK AT SPACE OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW SOMEWHERE OUT THERE THERE IS LIFE LIKE OURS BUT TO FINALLY HAVE CONFIRMATION IT'S TO BAD THAT WE ARE LIMITED BY OUR TECHNOLOGY AND BY OUR EVOLUTION WE DON'T LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SEND SOMEONE TO DEEP SPACE AND OUR TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ADVANCED ENOUGH TO SEND SOMEONE TO DEEP SPACE IN THE SHORT TIME WE HAVE
NEARLY YEARS TO COVER A DISTANCE THAT LIGHT COVERS IN LESS THAN HOURS AND EVEN LIGHT ITSELF IS PATHETICALLY SLOW TAKING YEARS JUST TO CROSS OUR OWN GALAXY

TECHNOLOGY HAS SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO
IMAGES Q ABN AND

YOU MEAN BALD GIRL NAKED UNDER A BATHROBE

LIVE ODOMETER OF WHERE THE VOYAGERS ARE
NICE SO IF WE DISCOVERED LIGHT SPEED TRAVEL WE COULD GO AND GET IT AND BE BACK HOME IN LESS THAN A WEEKEND
SO IS IT CORRECT TO SAY IF VOYAGER WERE TO TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT BACK TO EARTH IT WOULD TAKE MIN AND S
ALMOST TWICE AS FAR FROM US AS WE ARE FROM THE SUN KEEP GOING VOYAGER

EDIT DEAR LORD I READ HOURS AS MINUTES

WHAT ARE BRAIN DOING
IT MIGHT BE A REALLY DUMB QUESTION SINCE MY BRAIN HAS TAKEN A BEATING OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS FROM WORK BUT HOW DID THEY GET THIS THING TO TWEET
OR YOU WERE HOURS MINUTES AND SECONDS AGO PLUS THE TIME IT TAKES YOUR TWEET TO BE PROCESSED
IF WE BUILT ONE WITH TODAYS TECHNOLOGY IT WOULD GET TO WERE THE VOYAGER 2 IS IN HALF THE TIME AND THEN WE BUILD ANOTHER IN YEARS AND ITLL BE THERE IN JUST 2 YEARS AND THEN THAT ONE WOULD FALL OFF THE EDGE OF SPACE BECAUSE SPACE IS FLAT
GOING TO WANT TO LOOK AT SOME AIRBNBS ON THE WAY HOURS IS TOO MUCH TRAVEL FOR ONE DAY
I ALSO FIND IT AMAZING ASSUMING THIS TWEET WASN'T TO BE SENT OUT AT A CALCULATED TIME THAT PROBE CAN SEND A SIGNAL POWERFUL ENOUGH TO TRAVEL FOR HOURS
DAMN SPACE IS BIG AND LIGHT TRAVELS FAST WOW I MEAN I KNEW THAT BUT THIS HELPED ME PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE A BIT THE VASTNESS OF SPACE WAS ALWAYS SO ABSTRACT TO ME
IF I WOULD TRAVEL WITH THE SPEED OF LIGHT FOR MIN AND THEN BACK TO OF FOR MINERALOGY HOW MUCH TIME WOULD HAVE PASSED ON EARTH SINCE I LEFT
BEING SOMEONE WHO IS A BOOB ABOUT ANYTHING SPACE RELATED WHAT KIND OF INFO IS THE VOYAGER 2 RETRIEVING AND HOW ARE WE ABLE TO GET THAT INFO FROM SO FAR AWAY IF WE ARE GETTING IT AT ALL
AND IT GETS A BETTER INTERNET CONNECTION IN SPACE THAN I DO IN AUSTRALIA
HOW DOES A ROBOT LIKE THIS HAVE INTERNET SATELLITE INTERNEES I GUESS

ANNNNND FOR PERSPECTIVE THE NEAREST STAR ALPHA CENTAURI IS LIGHT YEARS AWAY

WE'RE GONNA NEED A FASTER SHIP
SEASONS FOR OF THOSE HOURS THEN JUST MINUTES TO REKINDLE ITS LOVE OF COFFEE AND TAKE A 2 MINUTE TRIP THROUGH A WORMHOLE
AHH SO THE ATOMIC LASER I SHOT AT IT HAS SOME TIME TO TRAVEL YET MAWAHHAHAHA
HOW MANY MILES AWAY IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SMARTER THAN ME I HAVE THE DUMB DISEASE RIGHT NOW
DOES THAT MEAN IT SENT OUT THAT TWEET AND MINUTES BEFORE IT GOT TO THAT DISTANCE FROM EARTH
DISTANCE IS M S X HOURS X MINUTES PER HOUR X SECONDS PER MINUTE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN

SO THE DISTANCE IS E METERS

OR KILOMETERS

OR MILES

THAT'S QUITE A DISTANCE

AND TO THINK VOYAGER 2 WAS LAUNCHED OVER YEARS AGO IT'S OLDER THAN I AM AND OVER BILLION MILES AWAY TO THINK THAT IF IT WERE TRAVELLING AT LIGHTSPEED IT COULD COVER THE SAME DISTANCE IN A SIMILAR TIME THAT IT TAKES FLY THE DALLAS SYDNEY ROUTE
I'M REALLY CURIOUS AND THIS MIGHT BE A DUMB QUESTION WE'VE KNOWN VOYAGER IS FAR AWAY FOR A WHILE NOW WHY IS THIS POST SPECIFICALLY BEING UNVOTED SO MUCH IS THERE SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT ABOUT HOURS AND MINUTES OF LIGHT TRAVEL
AS A STUPID PERSON CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW IT GOT AWAY FROM US SO FAR AND SO FAST
INTERESTING TO THINK THAT IT WILL TAKE APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER YEARS TO LEAVE OUR GALAXY AND ITS JUST OUR CLOSE NEIGHBORHOOD
WHAT SORT OF INFORMATION ARE THEY STILL GETTING FROM VOYAGER 2 OR ARE THEY JUST SEEING HOW FAR IT WILL GO NOW BEFORE THEY LOSE ALL CONTACT WITH IT
UHH I'M A BIT CONFUSED WHAT THIS MEANS SOMEONE CARE TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS MEANS
HOW IS POSSIBLE COMMUNICATE WITH VOYAGER IF IT IS SO FAR AND HOW LONG TAKES THE MESSAGES TO ARRIVE TO THE EARTH
THAT'S ALMOST AU IF MY MATH IS RIGHT WHICH IT PROBABLY ISN'T BECAUSE I SUCK AT MATHEMATICS
SO AT LIGHT SPEED IT WOULD TAKE ME STILL ALMOST HOURS TO ARRIVE AT THAT POINT
VOYAGER 2 PLEASE TAKE ME WITH YOU MY HOME COUNTRY AND THE COUNTRY I WANT TO SERVE ARE BOTH GOING CRAZY
IT TOOK MY AGE OF YEARS TO TRAVEL AT LIGHT SPEED
MY ENTIRE LIFE SO FAR EVERYTHING I'VE DONE IN LESS THAN A DAY
SOMEHOW THIS MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE DEPRESSED INSIDE HOURS OF TIME THAT'S THE LONGEST DISTANCE A MAN-MADE OBJECT HAS TRAVELED AWAY FROM EARTH AND IT TOOK YEARS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW DISTANCE IN THE UNIVERSE IS MEASURED BY YEARS OF TIME YOU JUST REALIZE HOW INSANELY REMOTE SPACE AND THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE IS TO US
I SUPPOSE THAT IS THE AVERAGE DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH BECAUSE THE EARTH IS APPROXIMATELY LIGHT MINUTES FROM THE SUN ON AVERAGE WHICH MEANS THAT VOYAGERS AND ANY OTHER BODY OUTSIDE OF EARTHS GRAVITATIONAL DISTANCE WOULD VARY UP TO LIGHT MINUTES WOULDN'T IT BE MORE ACCURATE TO JUDGE ITS DISTANCE FROM SOL INSTEAD
I LIKE TO THINK THAT OUR FIRST MISSION OF LIGHT SPEED TRAVEL WILL BE TO BRING THIS GUY BACK HOME
APOLOGIES IF ITS BEEN ANSWERED NO CTRL F ON MOBILE BUT HOW DOES VOYAGER COMMUNICATE WITH EARTH OR ARE THESE ONLY ESTIMATIONS
EVEN VOYAGER 2 HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GET ON BOARD
FOR REFERENCE ANDROMEDA IS MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY FROM EARTH THIS PROBE COULD FLY FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS AND IT'D NEVER REACH ANDROMEDA
THIS MAY BE REALLY STUPID BUT CONSIDERING TIME DILATION WHAT YEAR IS IT FOR THE VOYAGER LIKE IS IT ALREADY LOOKING AT US IN THE PAST OR IS IT NOT FAR AWAY ENOUGH YET
MANKIND'S MONOLITH TO THE UNIVERSE

I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER HOW MANY ALIEN PLANETS HAVE REACHED TO OUR LEVEL OF TOSSING OBJECTS OUT INTO SPACE AND WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF BUMPING INTO EACH DISCARDED PROBES SATELLITES AND TRASH
CONSIDERING IT TAKES SECONDS FOR LIGHT TO REACH EARTH FROM THE SUN THAT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE
WE ARE STILL SO PATHETICALLY SLOW YEARS TO GO LIGHT HOURS

WHERE IS A DECENT WARP DRIVE WHEN YOU NEED ONE
IF NASA CAN BUILD A MADE IN USA SPACE CRAFT THAT CAN TRAVEL FREAKING LIGHT HOURS AWAY FROM HERE WHY DOES MY CAR BASICALLY FALL APART AFTER MILES OR SO
AT HOURS LIGHT TRAVEL VOYAGER 2 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY PARSECS AWAY IS IT YET
I HAD TO LAUGH AT MYSELF HERE BUZ I SAW NSF IN U AND THOUGHT NOT SAFE FOR VOYAGER 2 INSTEAD OF NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
I DON'T GET HOW THIS TIME MEASUREMENT WORKS I KNOW THAT SPEED OF LIGHT IS M S SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT DISTANCE IS SECOND OF LIGHT SPEED AWAY


SO IF THIS IS HOURS DOES THIS MEAN THAT'S LIKE I DONT EVEN WANT TO DO THE MATHEMATICS

SOMETHING ABOUT VOYAGER 2 GIVES ME A WARM FEELING INSIDE TO KNOW THAT LONG AFTER HUMANS ARE DEAD THIS MACHINE MADE BY US WILL BE FLOATING THROUGH SPACE FARTHER THAN WE COULD EVER DREAM OF GOING WHO KNOWS IF IT'LL EVER BE FOUND AND THE GOLDEN PLAQUE EVER UNDERSTOOD PROBABLY NOT BUT NEVERTHELESS THIS IS OUR WAY OF TELLING OTHER BEINGS IF IT IS FOUND THAT WE EXIST OR THAT WE EXISTED THE ETERNAL WANDERER
IT'S GONNA TAKE A FUCKING LONG TIME TO GET ANYWHERE AHA IF THE CLOSEST STAR IS LIGHT YEAR AWAY IT'S BARELY MADE IT THROUGH THE FIRST DAY TO GET THERE
FURTHER OUT THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN WITH EQUIPMENT OLDER THAN MY FIRST COMPUTER
MATH PROBLEM FOR THE NERDS

ASSUME WE TAKE ONE SINGLE FRAME PICTURE THAT CAPTURES THE ENTIRE MILKY WAY GALAXY IMAGINE STANDING OUTSIDE THE GALAXY WITH THE CAMERA PERPENDICULAR TO THE DISK NOT EDGE ON FINALLY ASSUME VOYAGER IS MOVING PARALLEL TO THE DISK

USING A FULL FRAME CAMERA WITH A LENS HOW FAR AWAY WILL VOYAGER NEED TO BE BEFORE THE LIGHT OF THE SUN AND THE LIGHT OF VOYAGER NO LONGER SHARE THE SAME PIXEL
IT CAN POST TO TWITTER FROM LAYOUT THERE AND I CANT GET A SIGNAL FROM MY BASEMENT SH
HOW DOES ONE VERIFY A SPACE TWITTER ACCOUNT CLEARLY NO ONE HAS FIGURED THAT ONE OUT YET
PLEASE HAVE A THOUGHT FOR THE LITTLE ROBOTS ON MARS THAT STAYED ALIVE FOR YEARS INSTEAD OF THE VERY SHORT TIME WE EXPECTED THEM TO LIVE THOSE TWO LITTLE ROBOTS SPIRIT AND OPPORTUNITY ARE STILL THERE BATTLING THE WINDS THE COLD NIGHTS WITH THE SKY AND THE UNIVERSE ABOVE THEM
IT'S JUST GOING TO GO IN A GIANT CIRCLE AND THEN CRASH BACK INTO EARTH IN YEARS

EDIT WAIT WILL EARTH BE GONE THEME
WHAT IS THIS CLOSE TO BILLION MILES LIGHT TRAVELS CLOSE TO MILLION MILES PER HOUR RIGHT THE FACT WE ARE RECEIVING A SIGNAL STILL IS JUST NUTS
IT IS SAD TO THINK ONE DAY THIS THING MAY BE SENDING MESSAGES BACK TO EARTH AND NO HUMANS WILL BE HERE TO HEAR THEM
SO DOES IT TAKE HRS MINS AND SEC FOR THAT TWEET TO BE TRANSMITTED BACK TO EARTH
THE FACT THAT THE INSTRUMENTS WON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO OPERATE SOON UPSETS ME MORE THAN IT PROBABLY SHOULD

HOPEFULLY IT CAN FIND ANOTHER STAR IN A BILLION OR SO YEARS AND BOOT UP AGAIN
I THOUGHT VOYAGER WAS LIGHT YEARS AWAY AND STRANDED IN THE DELTA QUADRANT
ALMOST YEARS AT MPH AND IT STILL HASN'T EVEN MADE IT TH OF A LIGHT YEAR

THE UNIVERSE IS BIG

JUST AYIN
STILL A FEW LIGHT DAYS BEFORE IT TO THE HALFWAY POINT OF ASS
HOW DOES IT TWEET OR HAVE ANY COMMUNICATION I LOSE CELL SIGNAL OUTSIDE OF THE CITY
JUST CURIOUS IF VOYAGER WAS DESTROYED IN THIS EXACT MOMENT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE US TO FIND OUT
THAT'S AN INSANE DISTANCE HOW DOES IT TRANSMIT DATA TO US AND HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE AT THIS POINT
WHAT DO YOU THINK OUR SOLAR SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE FROM THAT FAR AWAY WOULD WE BE A BRIGHT HORIZON OR JUST ANOTHER TWINKLING BEACON IN THE BLANKET OF STARS
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS THIS LITTLE PROBE SMEARING ITSELF ON THE SIDE OF A MASSIVE EXTRATERRESTRIAL SPACESHIP LIKE A BUG ON A WINDSHIELD
THAT'S JUST AWESOME HOW NASA KNOWS WHERE EXACTLY IT IS DESPITE IT BEING SO FAR AWAY
FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE THE EARTH IS ABOUT LIGHT MINUTES AWAY FROM THE SUN
OR LIGHT YEARS FURTHER THAN I'D THOUGHT BUT STILL NOWHERE AT ALL
KINDA WEIRD TO THINK ABOUT THAT MAYBE RIGHT NOW THEY ARE READING US AS HISTORY MATERIAL FROM A DIFFERENT LIVE FORM
HOW DOES SOMETHING ON SPACE HAVE INTERNET TO POST THINGS LIKE THIS I DONT GET IT
BTW LIGHT TRAVELS ABOUT FT IN NANOSECOND OR BILLION FEET IN ONE SECOND SO YOU CAN USE THAT TO FIND THE DISTANCE OF YOU WANT
HOW DO THEY CALCULATE SECONDS DO THEY LIKE PUT THAT IN AT THE TIME IT WAS BEING WRITTEN OR DO THEY GO BACK TO IT AND PUT IN THE CURRENT SECONDS AND IMMEDIATELY CLICK SUBMIT
NOW IMAGINE IF WE'VE INVENTED NEAR LIGHT TRAVEL HOW LAUGHABLE THIS YEARS OF TRAVEL WOULD SUDDENLY BECOME
IS IT SAYING THAT IN ABOUT HOURS IT WILL HAVE TRAVELED ONE LIGHT YEAR
VOYAGER 2 LAUNCHED ON AUGUST HAS BEEN TRAVELING FOR DAYS AND IS ONLY HRS AWAY IF I WERE TO TRAVEL TO IT AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT THAT IS AWESOME
THAT'S NOTHING YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY VOYAGER IS HOURS AWAY AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT
SO HOW FAR IS IT IN RELATION TO VOYAGER ROUGHLY AND HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO REACH THE NEXT POTENTIAL SYSTEM TRAVELING AT THIS SPEED CMON YOU SCIENTISTS THIS IS YOUR TIME TO SHINE
WHAT IF IS STARTED COMING BACK TOWARDS US FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
THERE ARE MANY THINGS ABOUT THE VOYAGER THAT BLOWS MY MIND TODAY IT IS REALIZING THAT WE KIND OF KNOW WHERE IT IS THIS FAR FROM THE EARTH
HOURS SEEM LIKE A LONG TIME BUT VOYAGER HAS BEEN OUT FOR DECADES CRAZY
I WONDER WAS THIS TWEET SEND WHEN VOYAGER WAS THIS DISTANCE OR DID IT ARRIVE ON EARTH AT THAT TIME I KNOW IT WAS MADE BY SOMEONE ON EARTH LET A MAN HAVE HIS FUN
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR IT TO PHONE HOME AND HOW DOES IT SEND RECEIVE
WE STILL HAVE COMAS WITH THIS THING

HOW FAR OUT CAN IT SEND BACK INFO

ALSO TRYING TO IMAGINE A VAST INFINITE BLACKNESS THAT HAS NO END MAKES ME SMELL TOAST
HOW IS DATA COMMUNICATED BETWEEN THE VOYAGER AND EARTH RADIO WAVES
ARE THE TRANSMITTERS THAT POWERFUL HOW MUCH FURTHER BEFORE IT CANNOT COMMUNICATE BACK TO MOTHER EARTH
DELETED
LIGHT YEARS VOYAGER 2 IS STIL CLOSER TO US THAN ANY OTHER SOLAR SYSTEM

LUDACRIS SPEED LUDACRIS SPEED
DISCOVERING LISTENING TO THE ANCIENT PROBE VOYAGER ELITE DANGEROUS YOU CAN ALWAYS GO VISIT IT IN ELITE ANSEROUS
TOTAL ANNIHILATION INTRO BRIGHTER WHAT BEGAN AS A CONFLICT OVER THE TRANSFER OF CONSCIOUSNESS FROM FLESH TO MACHINES ESCALATED INTO A WAR WHICH HAS DECIMATED A MILLION WORLDS THE CORE AND THE ARM HAVE ALL BUT EXHAUSTED THE RESOURCES OF A GALAXY IN THEIR STRUGGLE FOR DOMINATION
ULTIMATE SKYRIN VOYAGER 2 IS THAT A CRAB WITH A TOP HAT AND A MONOCLE THATS WHERE I DRAW THE LINE COME ON MASTER CHIEF LET'S GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE FOR REFERENCE
DOCTOR WHO GRIDLOCK SCENE THEY'RE ACTUALLY CALLED ACRA
THE TRUMAN SHOW WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
IF MEMORY SERVES ME RIGHT THAT'S AS NEAR AS MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO FOUR TIMES FURTHER THAN NEPTUNE
LET'S HOPE IT'S NEVER FOUND BY ANYONE ADVANCED ENOUGH TO USE IT TO FIND AND TRAVEL TO OUR LOCATION
I THOUGHT HOURS MINUTES ISN'T THAT LONG THEN I REMEMBERED IT'S LIGHT TRAVEL TIME
WOULDN'T IT BE SO COOL IF SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE WE COULD GO REACH IT AS OUR TECHNOLOGY WOULD HAVE EVOLVE
WOW THATS LESS THAN AND THE ORT CLOUD IS ABOUT TO AU WHICH MEANS SHE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO
WELL SURE BUT HE SENT THAT ALMOST HOURS AGO SO NOW HE'S EVEN FURTHER
SO IS COMMUNICATION DONE THROUGH QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT IS THIS WHAT STAR TREK SUGGESTS AS SUBSPACE
SO WHAT IS THE TIME DIFFERENCE VOYAGER IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING NOT BEING TIED TO A LARGE GRAVITATIONAL BODY
DELETED
CLOSEST STAR IS LIGHT YEARS AWAY REALLY PUTS THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE

EDIT I MEAN CLOSEST STAR NOT INCLUDING THE SUN OBVIOUSLY
WAIT IS IT STILL POWERED I KNOW IT'S NOT TWEETING BUT IS IT STILL ON
YEAH BUT THAT'S HOURS AND MINUTES OF LIGHT TRAVEL AWAY FROM NEW YORK TY
VOYAGER 2 LEFT EARTH ON SEPTEMBER THAT WAS AS OF THE WRITING OF THIS DAYS AGO HOURS MINUTES AND SECONDS WORKS OUT TO A GRAND TOTAL OF LIGHT SECONDS SO ON AVERAGE THE VOYAGER 2 PROBE TRAVELS AWAY FROM EARTH AS A RATE OF ABOUT LIGHT SECONDS PER DAY
IS THERE A GRAPHIC WITH A TIMELINE LOCATION PROJECTION OF TRAVELS WHERE WILL IT BE IN K YEARS
AND EARTH IS LIGHT MINUTES FROM THE SUN THIS LITTLE GUY IS REALLY REALLY FAR AWAY FROM US
WHAT KIND OF TIME MEASUREMENT IS L IT AIN'T ISO ALTHOUGH IT'S THE DAY IS TOMORROW WHAT DOES THE AT THE END MEAN IS IT A DESIGNATOR FOR THE LIMA MILITARY TIME ZONE AS OPPOSED TO THE ZULU MILITARY TIME ZONE
IF MY MATH IS CORRECT THAT'S MILES BILLION MILES

MPS

PM

MPH

CURRENT DISTANCE IN

MILES
SO DOES THAT MEAN IT TOOK HOURS FOR THAT MESSAGE TO BE RECEIVED FROM THE TIME IT WAS SENT SOUNDS LIKE A STUPID QUESTION I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THIS WHOLE LIGHT HOURS AWAY THING
HOURS IS SECONDS
MINUTES IS SECONDS
SECONDS LEFT OVER

THAT'S SECONDS OF LIGHT TRAVEL

LIGHT TRAVELS AT M S

THAT MAKES IT METERS AWAY

IN A LITTLE EASIER PATH THAT'S KM AWAY

AT THAT POINT VOYAGER 2 WAS OVER KM AWAY OR JUST UNDER MILES AWAY

THIS HOWEVER IS ONLY LIGHT YEARS AWAY
IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING AND I WAS LOOKED IT UP MILES ABOUT SIX QUADRILLION
IS THERE A LIST SOMEWHERE OF WHAT YEAR IT'LL REACH CERTAIN POINTS ON ITS PROPOSED JOURNEY
I WAS EXPECTING THIS TO BE SOME SPACE PORN WITH A TWITTER HANDLE LIKE THAT I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED NOT ONE BIT
I DID THE MATH AND I BELIEVE WE ARE LOOKING AT ANOTHER YEARS BEFORE IT IS ONE LIGHTYEARS AWAY IF IT CONTINUES AT THE SAME DISTANCE TIME THAT IT HAS THUS FAR
MILES PER SEC I ALWAYS TRY TO REMEMBER THAT AT LEAST
DELETED
WILL THERE BE A POINT WHEN WE WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO TELL HOW FAR VOYAGER 2 HAS GONE AND IF SO HOW LONG
MILLION MILES AWAY THANK YOU GOOGLE AND THANK YOU VOYAGER 2 CREW STILL CAN'T FATHOM HOW FAR THAT IS JANIKOWSKI COULD PROBABLY MAKE IT THROUGH
NOW THAT I KNOW HOW FAR IT REALLY IS JANIKOWSKI MIGHT FALL A YARD SHORT
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS DOES THIS SOMEHOW COMMUNICATE INSTANTLY WITH EARTH DESPITE THE DISTANCE IF SO WHY DOES IT TAKE MINUTES FOR SOMEONE SITTING NEXT TO ME TO GET A TEXT I SEND THEM IF NOT THEN DID IT CALCULATE THIS TRAVEL TIME FOR WHERE IT WAS WHEN IT SENT THE MESSAGE OR WHERE IT WOULD BE WHEN WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE
I AM NOT IMPRESSED EMDRIVE WILL BE THERE IN SECONDS OF LIGHT TRAVEL
I REALLY WANT THEM TO AIM THE FIRST EM DRIVE TEST IN SUCH A WAY THAT IF IT DOES CONTINUOUSLY PRODUCE THRUST DEEP IN SPACE THAT IT CAN CATCH AND OVERTAKE VOYAGER
IT'LL BE HUGE WHEN HE'S HOURS AWAY ONLY MORE TO GO FOR A LIGHT YEAR EXCEPT IT'S SLOWING DOWN SO IT'LL TAKE A LOT LONGER
WHICH IS BILLION MILES IF YOU TRIED TO WALK THAT FAR IT WOULD TAKE YOU OVER THOUSAND YEARS
WHEN IT WROTE THAT MESSAGE DID IT TAKE IN ACCOUNT THE TIME IT TOOK FOR EARTH TO RECEIVE THE MESSAGE
SERIOUS HOW DO WE STILL GET TRANSMISSION FROM SOMETHING SO FAR AWAY OR DO WE JUST KNOW ITS SPEED SO WE CAN ESTIMATE ITS DISTANCE

ALSO WHAT IS VOYAGER DOING
ISN'T IT LESS WORK TO JUST LINK TO THE TWEET RATHER THAN SAVE A SCREEN SHOT CROP IT UPLOAD IT AND THEN LINK TO THE IMAGER PICTURE

I GUESS IT'S ALSO LESS WORK TO NOT EVEN REPLY LIKE THIS BUT HERE I AM DOING IT

FUCK THAT WAS SELF-DEFEATING WE ARE ALL DUMBER FOR HAVING READ THIS I AWARD ME NO POINTS AND MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL
FUN FACT THE VOYAGER II HAS ENOUGH JUICE TO BE OPERATING FOR ABOUT YEARS IS THE ESTIMATED TIME OF DEPLETE
CAN SOMEONE ELI HOW WE ARE STILL COMMUNICATING WITH VOYAGER 2 I'M WORKING IN THE TELECOM BUSINESS BUT THERE'S NO WAY I'M ABLE TO GRASP HOW WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH AN OBJECT THAT FAR AWAY


HOWEVER FAST THIS THING IS MOVING IT'S NOT EVEN HALF AS FAST AS EARTH TRAVELING AROUND THE SUN
HOW CAN YOU COMMUNICATE OVER A DISTANCE OF KILOMETERS I MEAN HOW FREAKING BIG MUST THE ANTENNA BE
MAN THAT'S CRAZY IF VOYAGER 2 WERE HEADING TOWARDS THE CLOSEST STAR TO OUR SOLAR SYSTEM WHICH IS LIGHT YEARS AWAY IT WOULD ONLY BE AROUND OF THE WAY THERE MY MATH COULD BE COMPLETELY WRONG THOUGH
JUST TO PUT THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE IT TOOK YEARS TO TRAVEL A DISTANCE WHICH CAN BE COVERED IN HOURS BY LIGHT THAT'S LIKE SYDNEY TO NEW YORK
SORRY IF IT'S A DUMB QUESTION BUT CAN WE SEE VOYAGERS FROM EARTH

LIKE FROM THE TELESCOPE THAT CHINA BUILT RECENTLY
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR DISTANCE I'VE KEPT TRACK OF THE DISTANCE FOR VOYAGER AND 2 FOR A WHILE JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY BUT WHY IS THIS DISTANCE SO SPECIAL IS THIS CONSIDERED INTERSTELLAR SPACE
ALL THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE JOKES ARE CUTE BUT THERE WAS NO TWITTER API PHS HEML ETC ETC ETC WHEN THIS CRAFT WAS PROGRAMMED YOU KIDS THESE DAYS THERE WAS NO INTERNET QUAINT THAT YOU THINK IT'S ALWAYS EXISTED
BAH EVENTUALLY THE THING IS GOING TO FALL OFF THE EDGE EVERYONE KNOWS THE UNIVERSE IS FLAT JEES YOU SCIENCE TYPE
IT'D BE IRONIC IF AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WE COULD FLY OUT AND GET IT BACK AND THAT ONLY TOOK A LONG WEEKEND OR SOMETHING

SPACE TAXI DRIVER YOU'VE BEEN TRAVELLING HOW LONG IF YOU'D WAITED I COULD HAVE GOT YOU HERE IN A DAY OR 2 MATE
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FOR US TO RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE AND BY THE TIME WE RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE HOW MUCH FURTHER IN LIGHT TRAVEL WAS VOYAGER 2
WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS I DIDN'T SEE IT WAS VOYAGER 2 AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME POST IN R IAMVERYSMART
I AM WONDERING IF COMMUNICATING WITH IT WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME VERY DIFFICULT

I AM SURE THERE MUST BE A LAG OF OVER HOURS IN COMMUNICATION ALREADY IF IT TAKES LIGHT HOURS TO TRAVEL WHEREVER IN THE SPACE IT IS RIGHT NOW


CAN SOME ENGINEER GUY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY IN SPACE RF DOESNT ATTENUATE UNLIKE HERE ON EARTH IS THIS BECAUSE IT USES SOME HIGH RADIO FREQUENCY COMPARE TO MY WIFI GHZ
YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH THEM HERE
THE REAL QUESTION IS DID THE POSTING TIME TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE MESSAGE WOULD BE POSTED HOURS AND MINUTES AFTER IT WAS ACTUALLY SENT
WHEN IT WAS LAUNCHED DECADES AGO WAS IT THEN PROJECTED TO STILL BE COMMUNICATING WITH US TODAY OR HAS IT SURPASSED EXPECTATIONS
LIGHT HOURS TO GO UNTIL IT S ONE FULL LIGHT DAY AWAY LIGHT HOURS IS AWFULLY CLOSE TO BILLION KILOMETERS

AT ITS CURRENT SPEED OF KPH THAT MEANS WITHIN ABOUT DAYS IT WILL BE ONE LIGHT DAY AWAY SOO MIDSUMMER

TO BE MORE PRECISE VOYAGER 2 WILL BE ONE LIGHT DAY AWAY ON OR AROUND TUESDAY JULY NOT THAT THE NUMBERS I HAVE ACCESS TO HAVE ENOUGH DECIMAL PLACES TO REALLY SAY THAT WITH ANY CONFIDENCE
HOW DOES IT TWEET IS IT LIKE AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IT WILL TWEET A LIGHT YEAR DISTANCE
DID THEY ACCOUNT FOR THE TIME IT TOOK THE MESSAGE TO TRAVEL THAT DISTANCE
IS VOYAGER JUST COASTING AT KM H RIGHT NOW OR ARE ITS THRUSTERS ACTIVE INCREASING ITS VELOCITY

ASSUMING THAT ITS COASTING CAN WE EXPECT VOYAGER 2 TO REACH A FULL LIGHT DAY AWAY FROM THE SUN AROUND I DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR LIKELY COURSE ADJUSTMENTS AROUND ITS OF JUPITER URANUS SATURN AND NEPTUNE
INTERESTING HOW DOES VOYAGER 2 COMMUNICATE BACK TO US AND HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE I CAN'T POSSIBLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS ABLE TO AIM A COMMUNICATION AT US AND JUST HIT SEND AND IT MAKES IT
THEY CHOSE A GOOD NAME BECAUSE VOYAGER IS SO FAR OUT THAT IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S ON A VOYAGE OR SOMETHING I LOVE WEIRD LITTLE COINCIDENCES LIKE THIS
DOES THIS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE TIME IT TAKES THE MESSAGE TO REACH US
CONSIDERING THE SUN IS LIGHT SECONDS AWAY THAT IS A QUANTUM FUCK LOAD OF DISTANCE
TOTALLY THOUGHT THE TWITTER HANDLE WAS NSFWVOYAGER AT FIRST AND WAS TRYING TO PICTURE WHAT KINDA OF DIRTY THINGS THE VOYAGER WOULD TWEET ABOUT SPACE AH YEAH THAT'S A SWEET BLACK HOLE OR SOMETHING LIKE AIN'T NO BETTER FEELING THAN SPACE SUCKING YOU REAL HARD
SOME DAY VOYAGER 2 WILL BE RECOVERED AND PUT IN MUSEUM HOW GLORIOUS WOULDN'T IT BE TO BE SEEING IT AT THE AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM EXPLAINING TO MY GRANDKIDS HOW NO ONE IN COULD JUST CATCH UP TO IT AND THAT WHERE IT WAS CAUGHT ONLY SEEMED CLOSE TO THEM
THIS IS OFF ITS LIGHT HOURS AWAY
IF WE TWEET IT WILL IT RESPOND HOW DID THE ENGINEERS FIT A TWITTER CAPABILITY ON ON IT
HOW MANY LIGHT YEARS FROM WHERE THE SUN DOESNT SHINE YOU KNOW URANUS
CHROMATIC ABERRATION A LENS DEFECT

WIKI

BWJONES

THERE'S PRACTICALLY NO ATMOSPHERE ON THE MOON

EDIT ALTHOUGH WE'D STILL CONSIDER IT A PRETTY GOOD VACUUM BY EARTH STANDARDS

NOPE THATS CHROMATIC ABERRATION IN A TELESCOPE IF YOU LOOK AT A BRIGHT STAR YOU SHOULD SEE THE SAME THING
CHROMATIC ABERRATION CAUSED BY LOW QUALITY OPTICS ATMOSPHERE IS NOT DETECTABLE OPTICALLY
HMM NEVER NOTICED IT ON ANY OTHER PHOTOS I'VE TAKEN WITH IT ALSO MOON DOES HAVE A VERY SMALL ATMOSPHERE
YOU CAN DESIGN SPACECRAFT WITH ONE PERSON TECHNICALLY HOWEVER THAT PERSON WOULD NEED TO BE AN EXPERT IN CONTROLS PROPULSION STRUCTURES ETC NOT MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE EXIST IF ANY

SO PROBABLY AT LEAST ENGINEERS TO GET SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN EACH AREA FOR THE SPACECRAFT
HOW MANY CARPENTERS DOES IT TAKE TO BUILD A HOUSE

WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT THAT IS A STUPID QUESTION YOU WILL HAVE THE ANSWER TO YOURS
ROCKET CONSTRUCTION CAN HAVE A MASSIVE FOOTPRINT OF SUBCONTRACTORS SPACE MAY BE MORE STREAMLINED IN THAT REGARD BUT I KNOW FOR SURE THAT CONSTRUCTING EACH ENERGEIA INVOLVED ONE MILLION PEOPLE AND THE SATURN V CLOCKED IN AROUND SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MOST OF THEM WOULD BE WELDERS OR OTHERWISE
VERY FEW YOU NEED A LOT MORE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS THAN GUIDANCE OR PROPULSION EXPERTS
REALLY BEAUTIFUL CINEMATIC FOOTAGE
GEMINI RE-ENTRY FOOTAGE IS USED FOR THE TRANS LUNAR INJECTION BURN AT NICE WORK OTHERWISE

WHO ARE YOU

ARE YOU THIS PERSON CRAIG WILLITS

DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE OR TRAINING IN ROCKET SCIENCE

MOST IMPORTANTLY DO YOU HAVE CASH TO BURN AND WHY IS IT A ORG
MI FIRST IMPRESSION ABOUT THE PAGE

THE WEBPAGE IS OK BUT THE LOGO ISN'T VERY GOOD AND THAT'S A BIT STRANGE BUT IT'S EASILY EXPLAINED WITH WEB TEMPLATES SO YOUR WEB DOESN'T GIVE GOOD VIBRATIONS

AND THEN LIKE OTHER PEOPLE SAID NO INFO ABOUT WHAT YOU DO NO PICS BUT THE DONATE NOW BUTTON IS ALREADY OPERATIVE

PD LOOKS FUNNY THE MOTTO WITH AFFORDABLE SPACE EXPLORATION NOT REALLY REMEMBER WHAT IT SAID STARTS WITH YOU LIKE IN PORTAL 2 S APERTURE SCIENCE
CAN I JUST BRING UP THE FUCKING BANNER FOR THAT ARTICLE THAT'S A UNICORN IN SPACE POOPING MICROWAVES FOR THRUST
CAN'T WE CRANK UP THE POWER TO INDUCE A LARGER THRUST MAKING VARIABLES EASIER TO IDENTIFY
ITS NOT AS HAPHAZARD AS THE ARTICLE MAKES IT OUT TO BE THEY GIVE REFERENCE MATERIAL TO SUGGEST HOW THE PHYSICS MAY WORK SEE PILOT WAVES
YOU DON'T SEE DEBRIS WHIZZING BY BECAUSE

DEBRIS TENDS TO BE VERY SMALL AS IN SMALLER THAN A FEW CM OR IT WOULD BE TRACKED AND THE ISS WOULD BE STEERED AWAY FROM IT SMALL DEBRIS LIKE THAT WOULD BE INVISIBLE ON THE CAMERA

DEBRIS TENDS TO SLOW DOWN AND SPIRAL IN TOWARDS THE PLANET IT DEPENDS A BIT ON THE MASS OF THE DEBRIS AND THE ALTITUDE BUT IN GENERAL NOTHING STAYS AT THE ALTITUDE FOR MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS OR AT MOST YEARS EVEN THE MASSIVE ISS ITSELF SLOWS DOWN AND NEEDS A BOOST NOW AND THEN TO KEEP IT IN ORBIT

DEBRIS DOESN'T LEAVE A TRAIL THAT HIGH UP SO IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE TINY DEBRIS ITSELF IT'S INVISIBLE

SPEED DIFFERENCES IN SPACE TEND TO BE HUGE UNLESS THE DEBRIS ORIGINATED FROM THE ISS ITSELF SO DEBRIS MIGHT NOT BE IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA FOR MORE THAN A SINGLE FRAME IF THAT

EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF PIECES OF DEBRIS IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH SPACE IS BIG REALLY BIG THAT'S MANY MANY CUBIC KILOMETERS PER PIECE JUST LIKE ASTEROID FIELDS AREN'T LIKE IN THE MOVIES THE DEBRIS IS SO SPREAD OUT THAT UNLESS THE EVENT IS VERY RECENT OR WAS IN A VERY SIMILAR ORBIT YOU'RE NOT EVEN LIKELY TO BE CLOSE TO ANY ONE PIECE OF IT NEVER MIND CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE IT
SATELLITES WOULDN'T USUALLY HAPPEN TO PASS THE ISS THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SPACE THAT SEPARATES SATELLITES ALSO THE ISS DOES GET HIT BY SMALL METEORITES USUALLY THEY DON'T DO MUCH
I THINK THERE ARE THREE POINTS THAT EXPLAIN THAT

FIRSTLY SPACE DEBRIS IS A REAL CONCERN AND IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE AS DENSE AS MOVIES WANT YOU TO THINK THERE GENERALLY ARE HUGE DIFFERENCES IN VELOCITIES BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS EG THE STATION AND A PIECE OF DEBRIS SO AN OBJECT CAN BE A DIRECT DANGER IF IT'S STILL A LONG DISTANCE BUT NOT NECESSARILY A LONG TIME AWAY IF THE ISS WERE TO FLOAT IN A BIG SOUP OF SLOWLY TUMBLING DEBRIS IT WOULDN'T BE THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM SINCE THE RELATIVE SPEEDS ARE VERY LOW

BESIDES THAT WE KNOW WHERE THE ISS IS LOCATED SO PEOPLE WHO SEND STUFF UP MAKE SURE THEY DON'T PARK THEIR SATELLITE IN AN ORBIT CLOSE TO THE STATION SPACE IS BIG WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS CLOSE IN THIS CONTEXT IT COULD EASILY STILL ENTAIL A FEW MILES YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE A SATELLITE IF IT WAS PARKED ON THE GROUND A FEW MILES IN THE DISTANCE NEITHER WOULD YOU IF IT WERE TO FLOAT BY IN OUTER SPACE

FINALLY A LOT OF DEBRIS BURNS UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE ISS IS LOCATED IN LEO LOW EARTH ORBIT WHICH REALLY ISN'T THAT HIGH OUR ATMOSPHERE STILL HAS INFLUENCE ON OBJECTS FLOATING AROUND THERE THE ISS NEEDS A REBOAST ONCE IN A WHILE BECAUSE IT'S BEING DRAGGED DOWN BY THE ATMOSPHERE SMALL OBJECTS ARE LIGHTER AND HAVE LESS SURFACE SO THEY WILL GENERALLY BE DRAGGED DOWN QUICKER

SPACE IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLY HUGE THE VOLUME OF THE WHOLE ENTIRE EARTH IS M THE VOLUME CONTAINED BY GEO IS MAGNITUDES GREATER THAN THAT M CONTAINED WITHIN THAT MASSIVE SPHERE ARE OBJECTS THE SIZE OF A MARBLE OR LARGER THAT IS A WHOLE LOT OF EMPTY SPACE PER OBJECT ON AVERAGE

OF COURSE MOST OF THEM ARE BUNCHED UP IN IN THE COMMON ORBITS THAT THE BULK OF OUR SPACE MISSIONS ARE LAUNCHED INTO EVEN THEN THEY ARE PRETTY SPARSE BETWEEN AND TIMES A DAY ONE OF THOSE OBJECTS WILL COME WITHIN TO THE FRONT OR BACK AND TO THE SIDES TOP OR BOTTOM OF THE ISS THAT'S ONLY ONCE OR TWICE AN ORBIT KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST OF THESE ARE SMALLER THAN A SOFTBALL

NASA ONLY WORRIES ABOUT THE DEBRIS IF IT IS GOING TO COME WITHIN ALONG ITS ORBITAL TRACK OR WITHIN TO THE SIDE TOP OR BOTTOM IF THEY HAVE A IN CHANCE OF A COLLISION THEN THEY MIGHT DO A MANEUVER TO AVOID THE DEBRIS THEY'LL DEFINITELY DO ONE IF THERE IS A IN CHANCE THE LAST TIME THAT THEY HAD A IN CHANCE WAS IN THAT IS WHY YOU DON'T SEE STUFF STREAMING PAST IT ON A REGULAR BASIS AND WHY KESSLER SYNDROME IS A BIT OVERBLOWN

AS FOR THE SMALLER DEBRIS AND MICROMETEORITE THEY HAVE LAYERS OF SHIELDING PROTECTING EVERY COMPONENT RANGING FROM ALUMINUM TO KEVLAR THEY ONLY HAVE ONE COLLISION WITH AN OBJECT ABOUT IN SIZE EVERY SIX MONTHS ON AVERAGE
BECAUSE REALITY HAS MORE THEN WHAT YOU NEED WHILE CGI ONLY HAS WHAT YOU NEED BUT IF ASKED ENOUGH EVENTUALLY THE CGI WILL INCLUDE WHATEVER IS IN QUESTION JUST A MATTER OF TIME LIKE ALL THE OTHER UPDATED CGI MATERIAL

OR YOU COULD JUST BELIEVE THE SUN HAS NEVER REFLECTED OFF OF ANY SATELLITES IN ANY SPACE VIDEO FOOTAGE
SADLY NUMBER NIBURU IS MORE OF A CRYSTAL MAGIC ESP PYRAMID HOMEOPATHIC PLANET
NUMBER BIBIRU IS THE SUBJECT OF A DOOMSDAY STORY ORIGINATING FROM A WOMAN CLAIMING TO BE TELEPATHICALLY CONTACTED BY ALIENS FROM ZETA RETICULI IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BLOWN PAST EARTH IN UPSETTING THE AXIS OF ROTATION AND DESTROYING HUMANITY

SINCE HAS OBVIOUSLY PASSED WITHOUT INCIDENT THE MYTH HAS BEEN PERMUTATING WITH DIFFERENT DATES LOCATIONS AND NAMES PLANET NINE IS SIMPLY THEIR LATEST BANDWAGON WE'VE HAD NO LESS THAN THREE CONSPIRITARD THREADS ON THIS SUB YESTERDAY

THE CLOSEST TO THE OFFICIAL NAME IS TYCHE WHICH WAS A PREVIOUS AND SIMILAR HYPOTHETICAL PLANET NINE CANDIDATE RULED OUT BY WISE
THE TITLE IS KIND OF MISLEADING NASA IS DEVELOPING THE IMPACTOR ESA WILL BE DEVELOPING THE ORBITER THAT IS SUPPOSE TO OBSERVE THE IMPACT
TL R VERSION THE SAME REASON YOU CAN'T SEE THEM ON EARTH DURING THE DAY
I'M SORRY AM I AN IDIOT SHOULD THIS BE TITLED WHY YOU CAN'T SEE STARS IN PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE MOON CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE IF YOU WERE STANDING ON THE NIGHT TIME SIDE OF THE MOON YOU WOULD SEE A SHIT TON OF STARS NO
CREATED FOR MY VISUAL COMMUNICATION HONOURS FINAL PROJECT OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS AND I'VE BEEN VERY EXCITED TO SHARE IT HERE PLEASE DO SHARE ANY FEEDBACK CRITIQUE TOO THANKS REDDIN
I DIDN'T EVEN READ THE STORY THE VISUALS WERE CAPTIVATING ESPECIALLY LIKED THE DISTANCE TRAVELED AT THE END OF THE FIRST CHAPTER
THIS WAS AWESOME I SPENT ALL OF HALF AN HOUR READING THAT AND I AM VERY GLAD I DID I WOULD BE EXTREMELY EXCITED TO READ ANYTHING ELSE LIKE THIS
BEING A MINIMAL DESIGNER FRONT END DEVELOPER MYSELF THIS IS JUST LOVELY I LOVE IT BEAUTIFUL TYPOGRAPHY ALSO THE STORY IS REALLY ADORABLE AND NICE I REALLY ENJOYED IT

WELL DONE MATE

DIDN'T READ THE STORY EITHER I WAS PLAYING AROUND WITH THE ANIMATIONS IT'S WONDERFUL
IT WON'T CHANGE PEOPLE WILL LIKELY STILL CELEBRATE THEIR EARTH BIRTHDAY AND MAYBE HAVE A SMALLER CELEBRATION FOR THEIR MARS ARRIVAL MARSIVERSARY EACH MARTIAN YEAR

IT WILL TAKE A LOOOONG TIME AND PROBABLY BEING BORN ON MARS UNTIL PEOPLE START TO ONLY CELEBRATE THEIR MARTIAN BIRTHDAY

BUT EVEN WHILE LIVING ON MARS THINGS LIKE LEGAL AGE ETC WILL STILL BE MEASURED IN TERMS OF EARTHS YEARS FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE AND SO THE EARTH BIRTHDAY WILL STAY RELEVANT FOR A LOOING TIME
QUITE A FEW HARD SCI-FI SERIES USE THE IDEA OF STANDARD OR EARTH STANDARD TO DENOTE A CONVERSION TO THE EARTH TIMINGS
SO YOU CAN DISCUSS THINGS IN TERMS OF LOCAL YEARS OR LOCAL HOURS OR WHATEVER BUT EVERYONE KNOWS THE CONVERSION TO STANDARD YEARS ETC THAT BEEN HERE FOR YEARS WHAT IS THAT STANDARD OR THE DAYS ON THIS PLANET ARE STANDARD


I'M SURE THE FIRST COUPLE GENERATIONS WOULD STICK TO EARTH UNITS BUT I'D GUESS THAT EVENTUALLY PATRIOTISM OR PRACTICALITY AN EARTH YEAR DOESN'T WORK WITH ONE CYCLE OF MARS SEASONS WOULD LEAD TO THEM USING THEIR OWN
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO ADJUST TO A CALENDER SYSTEM THAT HOLDS TRUE TO THE ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM THEN THE GALAXY THEN THE UNIVERSE
SINCE WE EVOLVED ON EARTH OUR NATURAL SLEEP CYCLE WORKS OFF A CLOCK AS SUCH I WOULD BE MORE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT A DAY ON MARS WOULD BE LIKE IF WE MAINTAINED A HOUR CLOCK
TIME HAS TO BE MEASURED RELATIVE TO SOMETHING THE SCALE IS TOO LARGE OUTSIDE OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM FOR ANYTHING TO BE PRACTICAL SO WE'D LIKELY STAY WITHIN IT NOTHING WITHIN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM MAKES MORE SENSE THAN THE ORBIT OF THE PLANET WE EVOLVED ON SO I THINK EARTH YEARS WOULD PERSIST
OFFICES ALREADY HAVE CLOCKS THAT KEEP TIME IN OTHER COUNTRIES SINCE ITS IMPORTANT FOR BUSINESS SO WHY NOT THE SAME FOR OTHER PLANETS
I HAVE WORKED IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THINGS WENT AND YOU ONLY SAW THE SUN BY CHOICE

WHAT HAPPENS IS THE DAYS AND HOURS JUST START TO BLUR TOGETHER AM ISN'T MORNING IT IS TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS

WITH THAT SAID I AM BETTING THEY WOULD RETAIN THE EARTH CALENDAR
WELL WE WONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE HUMANS PROBABLY WONT ACHIEVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE WE GO EXTINCT
BETTER
THAT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE A SIGNED INTEGER OR FLOATING POINT NUMBER OVERFLOWED AND THUS WRAPPED AROUND AN EXTREMELY COMMON AND PREVENTABLE PROGRAMMING MISTAKE

AS BACKGROUND COMPUTERS STORE NUMERIC DATA IN A LIMITED WAY WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT NUMBERS YOU TRY TO STORE VARIABLES HAVE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM VALUES THAT YOU MUST NOT EXCEED IF YOU DO THEY OVERFLOW MANY SYSTEMS HANDLE OVERFLOW BY CAUSING THE VARIABLE TO WRAP AROUND TO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME AS AN EXAMPLE IF YOU ADD TO A SIGNED INTEGER WHOSE CURRENT VALUE IS THE MAXIMUM POSITIVE VALUE YOU END UP WITH THE MAXIMUM NEGATIVE VALUE
GOOD PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN INVESTIGATING THE EXOCARPS SCHIAPARELLI ANOMALY OF OCTOBER

SORRY BUT THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR NOT HAVING TRIPLE REDUNDANT IMU MEASUREMENTS TO PREVENT THIS EXACT THING THAT'S POOR DESIGN
THANKS

WE USED TO GET DECALS OF THE MISSION PATCHES FOR EVERY SHUTTLE LAUNCH BUT THAT ENDED BEFORE THE SHUTTLE PROGRAM DID I'VE GOT A FEW HERE SOMEWHERE I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND THEM AND SHARE
HEY EVERYONE I RECENTLY CAME ACROSS SOME OLD MISSION PATCHES THAT I INHERITED FROM MY GRANDFATHER WHEN HE PASSED AWAY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I NABBED THEM AS SOON AS THEY WERE OFFERED AS HIS STORIES OF WORKING IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY ALWAYS INSPIRED ME SO THESE WERE A GREAT THING FOR ME TO KEEP AND REMEMBER HIM WITH I PUT THEM ASIDE WHEN I GOT THEM AND CAME ACROSS THEM AGAIN TODAY AND THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE WORTH SHARING I DOUBT THERES MUCH HISTORICAL MERIT TO THEM WE ALWAYS USED TO TEASE HIM ABOUT LAUNCHING SKYNET THOUGH

MUCH OF WHAT HE DID WAS AND AS FAR AS I KNOW STILL IS CLASSIFIED BUT HE WAS PRETTY HIGH UP THE CHAIN AT BRITISH AEROSPACE AND THE STORIES HE COULD TELL WERE ALWAYS QUITE AMAZING HE ONCE TOLD ME ABOUT HOW HE CRASHED TWO RENTAL CARS ON A LEVEL CROSSING SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA TO STOP A TRAIN THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED AN ABORTED LAUNCH OF A MILITARY SATELLITE JUST BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE BACK IN THE UK FOR CHRISTMAS HE LEARNED AFTER THE LAUNCH THAT HE COULD HAVE JUST ASKED THE TRAIN DRIVER TO STOP OOPS

ANYWAY ENJOY THE PICTURES I ENJOY READING THIS PAGE SO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO SHARE SOMETHING WITH YOU ALL
AMAZING GRACE GOT ONE TOO ALTHOUGH SADLY TOO LATE WELL DESERVED ON BOTH COUNTS
PHOTO OF MANUSCRIPT HAMILTON AT THE AWARD CEREMONY
IN AN INTERVIEW SHE SAID WHEN I FIRST STARTED USING THIS PHRASE IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE QUITE AMUSING IT WAS AN ONGOING JOKE FOR A LONG TIME THEY LIKED TO KID ME ABOUT MY RADICAL IDEAS SOFTWARE EVENTUALLY AND NECESSARILY GAINED THE SAME RESPECT AS ANY OTHER DISCIPLINE

A WOMEN PUTS MEN ON MOON
IT'S GREAT SHE GOT THIS AWARD BUT IT MAKE ME WONDER WHAT EXACTLY DID ELLEN DEGENERES DO TO DESERVE THE SAME MEDAL
SORRY

SAY MARGARET HAMILTON AND SHE POPS INTO MY HEAD
EVERYONE ALIVE IS IN THIS ONE PICTURE DAMMIT I HAD MY EYES CLOSED

MAKES ME THINK WE MIGHT DESTROY THIS PLANET FOR NO REASON BURN ALL LIFE KNOWN TO US TO THE GROUND BUT THE UNIVERSE WILL GO ON IT WON'T EVEN NOTICE REALLY AND THAT MAKES ME STRANGELY HAPPY
OTHER MOONS MIND YOU THOSE ARE SMALL TEMPORARY CAPTURES SO CALLING THEM MOONS IS A BIT OF A STRETCH
COULD SOMEONE PHOTOSHOP THIS PICTURE TO INCLUDE ALL PLANETS BETWEEN THE EARTH AND MOON RELATIVE TO SIZE AND PHOTO QUALITY
WE HAVE A HUGE MOON FOR SUCH A RELATIVELY SMALL PLANET I WONDER HOW MUCH IT HAS TO DO WITH OUR NOT HAVING ANY OTHER PERMANENT NATURAL SATELLITES IF SOMETHING LIKE PHOBOS OR DEIMOS CAME NEAR THE EARTH WOULD THE MOON DISTURB ITS ORBIT ENOUGH TO MAKE IT UNSTABLE
I WONDER HOW EXPENSIVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE WOULD BE A SUPER COOL IDEA THOUGH
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T USE CENTILE SUBPIXELS MATRIX ARRANGEMENT SO AT LEAST SUBPIXELS PER PIXEL RED GREEN BLUE AND ISN'T OVER SATURATED AND THE GAMMA LEVEL ISN'T SCREWED ESPECIALLY FOR DARK SHADES THEN IT WOULD BE COOL
UNFORTUNATELY MOST AMBLED PANELS AND LCD ONES TOO THAT LOOK GORGEOUS HAVE OVERSATURATED COLORS AND SCREWED GAMMA LEVELS I KNOW THEY CAN BE CALIBRATED BUT AFTER CALIBRATING THEM TO BE COLOR ACCURATE THEY DON'T LOOK GORGEOUS ANYMORE TO AVERAGE PERSON'S EYES
WOULDN'T THAT REQUIRE AN HEMISPHERICAL SCREEN THOUGH THAT WOULD BE COOL AS HELL FLAT SCREENS ARE GETTING OLD FASHIONED ANYWAY TIME TO SPICE THINGS UP
WOW THIS IS SOME OF THE MOST BLATANT ADVERTISING I'VE SEEN IN A WHILE ALSO COMPLETELY OFF TOPIC
DOES IT HAVE INCREASED RESOLUTION OR JUST AN IMPROVED UPDATE RATE

AND DOES IT HAVE TWO MINION SATELLITES CALLED ZULU AND LINZ CLOTHO
WHAT'S WITH THIS RECENT TREND OF PUTTING THE AFTER PICTURE FIRST
I BELIEVE THE TIME MACHINE USED TO CAPTURE THE FOOTAGE ON THE LEFT IS WAY MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN SOME WEATHER SATELLITE
ALL I WANT IS COLOR IMAGES LIKE THE HIMAWARI

THE SATELLITE THAT TOOK THIS HETP
SOURCE FROM NOAA I FOUND THIS OLDER VIDEO LAST WEEK BEFORE THE LAUNCH AND THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE OVERVIEW OF JUST HOW MUCH BETTER DATA US WEATHER FORECASTING IS GOING TO GET

EDIT JUST WOKE UP TO SEE THIS BLOWN UP AT SO HERE'S THE ANSWERS TO A FEW FAQ

IT CAN SEE COLOR AS WELL THIS IS JUST A DEMO OF ITS IMAGING SPECTRAL BANDS OF COLOR ACTUALLY HUMANS ONLY SEE AND THE PREVIOUS SATELLITES ONLY SAW

2 IT LAUNCHED INTO SPACE THIS PAST SATURDAY ON A ULA ATLAS ROCKET WILL TAKE MONTHS TO GET THE FIRST PICTURES AND ABOUT A YEAR TO GET UP AND FULLY RUNNING SO DON'T EXPECT THE WEATHER FORECASTING TO START GETTING BETTER UNTIL THEN

THERE'S MORE COOL STUFF ON BOARD AS WELL THE FIRST USO LIGHTENING MAPPER AND A WHOLE SUITE OF SPACE WEATHER MONITORS

I TOO HATE THE BEFORE PICTURE BEING ON THE LEFT

HOW DID THEY GET THE AFTER PICTURE THEY HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH MIN FOR SPECIFIC STORMS ON THE CURRENT SATELLITES BUT IT COMES AT THE COST OF NOT SCANNING ELSEWHERE THE NEW ONE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SEC SCANS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE COMPARISON OF TECH SPECS

EDIT 2 THIS COMMENT HAS SOME MORE GOOD LINKS INCLUDING AN OLD AMA FROM THE TEAM
CONSOLE METEOROLOGISTS COUNTER THAT WEATHER LOOKS WAY MORE CINEMATIC AT
HOLD ON THEY NAMED THE SATELLITE AFTER DOZER A KING A DOZER THE GOZERIAN DOZER THE DESTRUCTOR DOZER THE TRAVELER VOLVULUS ZILDROHAR AND LORD OF THE SEBOUILLIA
DON'T WE ALREADY HAVE THIS I'VE WATCHED HIGH FPS VIDEOS OF HURRICANES FROM SPACE
FOR ALL THE SHIT THE US GOVERNMENT GETS IT TRULY IS A SERVICE TO THE WORLD ROCK ON NASA AND NOAA
SO WAIT IF THE FUTURE IS LATER THEN HOW DO WE HAVE THIS EXAMPLE NOW
GOOD LORD THE EYE OF THAT HURRICANE IS SO FAST COMPARED TO EVERYTHING ELSE
QUESTION FOR ANY STRAY METEOROLOGISTS HERE I NOTICE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE GIF IN THE HIGH FPS CAPTURE THERE ARE POINTS IN THE CLOUDS WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE WELLING UP ARE THESE THE UPDRAFTS FUELING THE STORMS BECAUSE IF SO THIS REALLY GIVES ME A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON HOW CLOUDS ARE FORMED
THEY USED WISCONSIN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE GIF I COULD LITERALLY SEE WHERE I LIVE FROM SPACE AMAZING
HEY IF WE'RE GONNA FUCK THE CLIMATE OVER LET'S AT LEAST RECORD IT IN
REALLY

LIKE DOZER THE DESTROYER
SO IS THIS GOING TO CHANGE WHAT EVERY WEATHER RADAR LOOKS LIKE AS IN THE COLORED PRESSURE MAPS THAT SHOW THE LAST COUPLE HOURS IN INCREMENTS OF TIME
SEEMS VERY SIMILAR TO THE HIMAWARI SATELLITE THAT AXA LAUNCHED A COUPLE WEEKS BACK AND THE HIMAWARI THAT IS ALREADY IN OPERATION THE ADVANCED BASELINE IMAGER USED IN IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE ADVANCED HIMAWARI IMAGER USED IN BOTH SATELLITES AND IS BUILT BY THE SAME COMPANY I WONDER IF CAN DO COLOR IMAGES LIKE THE HIMAWARI SATELLITES
HOLY SHIT I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED FOR ANOTHER BIG HURRICANE TO HIT

EDIT THAT SOUNDS WORSE NOW THAT I REDDIN ALOUD
I KEEP READING AS DOZER THE GOZERIAN AND I WONDER WHO AM I GONNA CALL
WHY IS THE FUTURE GRAPHIC SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE CURRENT GRAPHIC IF BOTH ARE USING THE SAME CURRENT TECHNOLOGY IF WE CAN MAKE THAT FUTURE ONE ALREADY WHY DON'T WE

EDIT FOUND A GOOD ANSWER THANKS U TRIPLECHUBZ
THE CURRENT SATELLITE SYSTEM DOES BOTH THE INTERMITTENT SCAN WE SEE ON THE RIGHT AND IS OCCASIONALLY ORDERED TO DO THE RAPID SCANS LIKE WE SEE ON THE LEFT THE NEW SATELLITE WILL BE DEDICATED TO DOING THE RAPID SCANS AS PART OF IT'S NORMAL WORKFLOW THAT SAID THE NEW SATELLITE WILL HAVE GREATER RESOLUTION AND WILL SEE IN MORE SPECTRUMS IT WILL ALSO TRANSMIT DATA TO EARTH MUCH FASTER ALLOWING FOR MORE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS AND CLOSER TO REAL TIME MONITORING

R SPACE COMMENTS ADAW ST IVTURXCY SH
NOAA S CURRENT GOES SATELLITES WERE BUILT WITH HARDWARE AND IF YOU WANT AN ANALOGY FOR THE TECHNOLOGICAL LEAP REPRESENTS JUST THINK ABOUT YOUR FIRST COMPUTER YEARS AGO COMPARED WITH WHAT S SITTING ON YOUR DESK TODAY THE ADVANCED BASELINE IMAGER ABI S PRIMARY INSTRUMENT SUITE IS SPEEDIER HIGHER RESOLUTION AND OVERALL FAR MORE CAPABLE THAN ITS PREDECESSORS

OUR CURRENT GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE CAMERAS DO THE ENTIRE WESTERN HEMISPHERE FROM THE NORTH POLE TO THE SOUTH POLE EVERY MINUTES ERIC WEBSTER OF HARRIS CORPORATION WHICH BUILT THE ABI TELLS GIZMODO THE ADVANCED BASELINE IMAGER CAN DO THE FULL DISC IN FIFTEEN MINUTES THE US IN FIVE AND A HURRICANE EVERY SECONDS IT DOES SO AT A RESOLUTION OF TO MILES TO 2 KM ACROSS THE ENTIRE WESTERN HEMISPHERE FROM MILES UP THAT S LIKE SEEING THE RIDGES ON THE SIDE OF A QUARTER LOCATED A MILE AWAY
WATCH V SQZIRAAZWVY
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THE CLOUDS IN AFTER YOU CAN SEE THE CUMULONIMBUS ANVIL CLOUDS BUBBLING AND DISSIPATED VERY QUICKLY
SO WE'VE BASICALLY BEEN AT THE LEVEL OF SPEED OF POWERPOINT THIS ENTIRE TIME
I'M DEFINITELY LATE TO THE PARTY BUT I'M A SATELLITE CONTROLLER FOR THE CURRENT SATELLITES AMA
SO EXCITED FOR THIS DISHONORED 2 PC PATCH MY GOD JUST LOOK AT THAT FRAME RATE IMPROVEMENT
ISN'T THE FUTURE ONE JUST THE CURRENT ONE AND THE CURRENT JUST A SLOWED DOWN CURRENT ONE THE IMAGER IS FASTER BUT ONLY FASTER TAKING PICTURES OF THE COMPLETE EARTH AT ONCE WHICH TAKES A FEW MINUTES NOT FASTER MAKING IMAGES FROM INDIVIDUAL STORMS ADAMIK I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE MISLEADING WHAT IS AT LEAST EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THE HIGHER RESOLUTION IN MY OPINION WHICH IS NOT SHOWN HERE
NOW WE GET TO SEE THE CLIMATE CHANGE APOCALYPSE IN PRESTIGE IMAGES
NOT TRYING TO SOUND LIKE AN IDIOT BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS MOVING ALL CHOPPY ON PURPOSE I THOUGHT THE POINT WAS TO KINDA SHOW THE DIRECTION THE STORM WOULD BE OVER THE NEXT AMOUNT OF SHORT TIME I GUESS I AM DUMB
ALL OF THE ABOVE APPARENTLY THE DATA COLLECTION IS EXPONENTIALLY BETTER TOO WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE REAL TIME QUALITY IMAGES
EVERY TIME I HEAR IT'S NAME I THINK OF TRUE FORM
AH AND NOW WE'LL BE ABLE TO WATCH THE STREAM LIVE AS THE GIGANTIC STORMS OF THE FUTURE FLASH FLOOD PARTS OF THE WORLD DUE TO THE EVER WARMING ATMOSPHERE
CAN WE NOT JUST POST DANK AND ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND SPECIFICS OF SUCH AN INCREDIBLE MACHINE SHOULDN'T THIS BE ABOUT WHAT R SPACE IS ABOUT
THIS LOOKS AMAZING CAN'T WAIT TO BE INFORMED IN SUCH HIGH DEFENCE

AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT I WONDER WHO NAMED THIS SATELLITE

I AM NOT THAT WORRIED ABOUT THE SATELLITE BUT THE TRAVELLER AND THE DESTRUCTOR MAKE ME UNEASY
THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING ABOUT THE SATELLITE IS THE ABILITY TO SEE THE FUTURE
I CAME HERE FOR A GATEKEEPER AND KEYMASTER REFERENCE AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED UNLIKE THE CHUBS AND BULLS I CAN TELL YOU
THIS MAY BE A DUMB QUESTION BUT HOW DID WE GET THE FUTURE IMAGES IF IT HASN'T LAUNCHED YET IS THERE ANOTHER WEATHER SATELLITE ALREADY IN ORBIT WITH THE SAME CAPACITY
UNTIL THIS THING IS SMART ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH CLOUD FORMS OF BUNNIES AND DINOSAURS IT IS A SERIOUS WASTE OF RESOURCES
WHY ARE WE LETTING THEM DO THIS THE NEW IS GOING TO MAKE THE WEATHER THAT MUCH FASTER
MANY CHUBS AND ZULUS SHALL KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE ROASTED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE LOAR ON THAT DAY I CAN TELL YOU
SO IT TAKES VIDEO RATHER THAN PICTURES WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO IMPLEMENT THIS
THE GOMARIAN MANY SHIVS AND ZULUS KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO BE ROASTED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE FLOR THAT DAY I CAN TELL YOU
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE LOOKS LIKE IT ALREADY IS LOOKING LIKE THAT
HOW WILL THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OFFERED BY THIS WEATHER TECHNOLOGY BE SQUARED WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH TO CLIMATE

OR IN A LESS WAY HOW WILL WE BE SO COOL WITH WEATHER AND SO UNCOOL WITH CLIMATE

IT'S LIKE BEING A TREE EXPERT BUT DENYING FOREST SCIENCE
NOW WE'LL BE ABLE TO WATCH OURSELVES DESTROY THE EARTH IN HIGHER FRAME RATES S
SO NOW WE CAN SEE NATURAL DISASTERS IN FPS

APPARENTLY TRUMP WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE
BEING ABLE TO SEE THE CLOUDS LIVE LIKE THAT MAKES IT LOOK A LOT LIKE SURF YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE BREAK IS AND EVERYTHING
IS THERE ANYWAY WE CAN GET A TV SHOW THAT EXPLAINS THESE TYPES OF IMAGES AND INSTRUMENTS I THINK IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL
THAT'S REALLY NEAT IM GLAD THE LAUNCH WENT ON WITHOUT A HITCH FOR A SECOND WHEN THE VIDEO FEED CUT I TOUGHT IT BLEW UP
I CAME HERE TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT DOZER THE TRAVELER HE WILL COME IN ONE OF THE FORMS DURING THE RECTIFICATION OF THE VULDRINI THE TRAVELER CAME AS A LARGE AND MOVING BORG THEN DURING THE THIRD RECONCILIATION OF THE LAST OF THE MCKITTRICK SUPPLICANTS THEY CHOSE A NEW FORM FOR HIM THAT OF A GIANT FLOR MANY SHIVS AND ZULUS KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO BE ROASTED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE FLOR THAT DAY I CAN TELL YOU I AM PREPARED FOR YOUR WRATH NOW
I DUNNO BOUT ALL BUT I'M PRETTY HESITANT TO BE DEALING WITH AND THE SECOND MISSION ZULU
I HAD THE CHANCE TO TOUR THE STATION RIGHT NEXT TO WALLOPS FLIGHT FACILITY ON THE EASTERN SHORE OF VIRGINIA WHERE THEY RECEIVE THE DATA SENT DOWN BY THESE SATELLITES THE SERVER ROOM TO HANDLE THE CRAZY AMOUNT AMOUNT OF DATA COLLECTED BY THE NEW SATELLITES IS ABOUT TIMES AS LARGE AS ITS PREDECESSOR IT LOOKED LIKE A SCENE FROM THE MATRIX
SO EXCITED FOR THIS AS A METEOROLOGY STUDENT IMAGINE GOING FROM THE ORIGINAL IPHONE TO THE PLUS
IT LOOKS LIKE WE ALREADY HAVE THE FUTURE'S WEATHER SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY ON THE LEFT SO LET'S JUST LOOK AT WEATHER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN FOR NOW ON AND SAVE MILLION DOLLARS
LOOKS LIKE THESE SATELLITES BUILT THEMSELVES A PC INSTEAD OF STICKING WITH A CONSOLE
DID ANYONE ELSE READ AS DOZER
JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T LET THE CREEPY BARBARIAN PAINTING TOUCH YOUR BABY
I GREW UP IN TORNADO ALLEY SO LOOKING AT WEATHER SATELLITE IMAGERY IS A LIFELONG OBSESSION

SEEING THIS HAS ME THINKING WHERE DO THE ARMCHAIR METEOROLOGISTS GATHER I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH AND IT LED ME BACK TO REDDIN
HOW CAN THE FUTURE BE SHOWN TO US NOW SHOULDN'T THE FUTURE BE THE PRESENT AND THE PRESENT BECOME THE PAST
DANG SON MAYBE THEY CAN ACCURATELY TELL ME THAT IT'S ALWAYS RAINING IN AK
ANYBODY KNOW WHY THEY DON'T SHOW THE OLD STYLE WEATHER MAPS WITH THE ISOBARS AND THE POINTY COLD FRONT BUMPY WARM FRONTS ANYMORE
HEY MEGA THANKS OP I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BUT I WAS STOKED HEARING ABOUT IT NONETHELESS

THANKS FOR DROPPING THIS GIF YOU'VE EFFECTIVELY DOUBLED MY ABOUT ALL THIS NOW THAT I CAN SEE THE IMPROVEMENT
WHEN THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OR WHOEVER LOGS INTO THE SYSTEM THAT CONNECTS TO THE SATELLITE IT HAD BETTER ASK ARE YOU A GOD
SILLY QUESTION BUT COULD WE DETONATE SOME KIND OF DEVICE INSIDE A HURRICANE TO DISRUPT THE CIRCULAR AIR CURRENT THUS ENDING THE EVENT
MY BUDDY ACTUALLY WORKED ON THE GOER AT LOCKHEED MARTIN SMART GUY I ASKED HIM WHAT THEY DID TO INCREASE RESOLUTION AND IMAGING FROM PREVIOUS MODELS APPARENTLY IT'S SECRET
WHY THE HELL IS THE FUTURE ON THE RIGHT AND CURRENT ON THE LEFT

IT'S THE SAME AS POSTING A BEFORE AFTER WITH THE AFTER ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES NO SENSE AND HURTS MY HEAD
I'M SURPRISED WE JUST GOT TO THIS POINT I WOULD HAVE GUESSED THE GIF ON THE RIGHT WAS FROM THE EARLY
I'VE NEVER BEEN INTERESTED IN WEATHER BUT THIS WOULD BE SWEET TO LIVE STREAM
MY GRANDPA WAS THE PROJECT LEAD FOR EVERY HOES SATELLITE LAUNCH UP UNTIL ABOUT I GOT TO SEE ONE WHEN I WAS A KID THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED WAS WATCHING A ROCKET LAUNCH FROM AS CLOSE AS NASA SAFELY ALLOWS
WHAT IS THESE WHITE THINGS ARE I THINK THIS BECOME A TREND BUT WHAT CHANGES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN IN NEXT

HEY U DELTAVVVVVVVVVVV

ACRONYM LISTS CONTACT CREATOR PHS SOURCE CODE
THE CHANGE IN MOTION CAPTURE IS AWESOME BUT CAN IT DO COLOR IN ADDITION TO BLACK AND WHITE
BUT WHAT ELSE IS IT GONNA DO I SEE THE PRIMARY IS WEATHER WHAT'S THE SECONDARY
THERE IS NO WEATHER ONLY ZULU
ISN'T WEATHER SATELLITE CODE FOR SPY SATELLITE AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED FROM THE MOVIES
I WAS AMAZED EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN THEY UPDATED THE LOCAL WEATHER STATION MAPS TO HAVE THOSE LITTLE LINES ON THE SCREEN TO SHOW HOW THE WIND CURRENTS WERE MOVING WHICH WAS PRETTY NEAT BECAUSE THE FLUID NATURE OF GAS BUT WATCHING THOSE THUNDERHEADS BURBLE FROM SPACE IS AWESOME

I SOUND LIKE MY YEAR OLD DAD
XA HAU RAI TA HAY SANG TNT HAN
BINT TRAN TARING NHỮNG G MANEH ANG C
BAI ĐÓ L HUNH PHC THC S

JUST THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS WHAT CIVILIAN WEATHER SATELLITES ARE CAPABLE OF JUST IMAGINE WHAT CAPABILITIES THE NRO HAS I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY HAD CRAZY RESOLUTION LIKE BEING ABLE TO READ THE NAME TAG OFF A SOLDIERS UNIFORM IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR ZONE
SO IS THIS JUST A CGI EXAMPLE HOW DID THEY GENERATE THE IMAGES WE'RE LOOKING AT WITHOUT THE FUTURE TECH UP THERE
HOW LONG UNTIL WE SEE IMPROVEMENTS LIKE THIS ON SAY THE WEATHER CHANNEL
CAN WE AGREE AS A PEOPLE THAT THE CURRENT SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON THE LEFT
AS A COMMERCIAL PILOT AND SOON TO BE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR AS WELL AS A US IMAGING COMPANY OWNER THIS WILL BE SUPER HELPFUL IN PREDICTING WEATHER

OH HI THERE DEARIE DIDN'T SEE YOU SO FAR UP IN THE CLOUDS THERE DONTCHAKNOW COME ON DOWN FOR SOME BEER AND CHEESE
HERE'S A VIDEO FROM THE MANUFACTURER OF THE IMAGER HARRIS CORPORATION THAT SHOWS THE SCANNING PROCESS IT USES TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMAGES

WATCH V QCAPWGQR
AS A PROUD WISCONSINITE I'M GLAD OUR STATE MADE THIS GIF BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT A GIANT HURRICANE APPEARS TO BE HEADED OUR WAY
HOW WOULD THIS AND THE CURRENT GOES SYSTEM COMPARE WITH THE METEOSAT SATELLITES EUROPE HAS
NICE BABOON PICTURES THIS IS WHY NASA IS USING ALL THE WORLD'S HELIUM AND IS RUNNING OUT COOPS
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE IMPROVEMENT

DOES ANYONE KNOW WHETHER OTHER REGIONS BESIDES NORTH AMERICA WILL ALSO PROFIT DOES THIS SATELLITE COVER OTHER CONTINENTS AND WOULD NASA TYPICALLY SHARE THE DATA WITH LOCAL WEATHER SERVICES

OR COULD OTHER COUNTRIES COMMISSION AN IDENTICAL SATELLITE TO GET THE SAME LOCAL COVERAGE
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE NUMEROUS PLUMES OF STEAM OUT OF NOWHERE SEEMS UNNATURAL
ONE SMALL STEP FOR CAMERAS ONE INCREDIBLE LEAP FOR WEATHER IMAGING CAMERAS
HOW THE HELL HAVE WE BEEN GETTING AWAY WITH THE OLD SATELLITES SERIOUSLY A HUMAN COULD MAKE A BETTER PREDICTION WITH THE NEW DATA THAN THE SUPERCOMPUTERS EXTRAPOLATING AND MAKING PREDICTIONS FROM THE OLD DATA
CAN WE RECEIVE THE SIGNAL OF THESE THE SAME WAY WE CAN GET THE OLDER ONES USING YOUR OWN ANTENNA AND A
ITS LIKE THE DIFFERENCE IN CG BETWEEN THE MATRIX AND THE MATRIX 2

VIDEO COMMENT

ABI THE FUTURE OF WEATHER MONITORING SOURCE FROM NOAA I FOUND THIS OLDER VIDEO LAST WEEK BEFORE THE LAUNCH AND THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE OVERVIEW OF JUST HOW MUCH BETTER DATA US WEATHER FORECASTING IS GOING TO GET
ABI SCAN MODE DEMONSTRATION HERE'S A VIDEO FROM THE MANUFACTURER OF THE IMAGER HARRIS CORPORATION THAT SHOWS THE SCANNING PROCESS IT USES TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT TYPES OF IMAGES
HURRICANE SANDY CURSOR DAY MOVIE OCTOBER YES GOES WHICH IS OPERATIONAL DOES HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF SUPER RAPID SCAN AND HAS BEEN USED IN EXPERIMENTAL MODE THE LAST FEW YEARS HURRICANE SANDY
WHICH WAY DID HE GO LATERAL CHARACTER MOVEMENT IN FILM FUN FACT LEFT VS RIGHT IS ACTUALLY A COMMON THEME USED IN CINEMATOGRAPHY TO DENOTE FORWARD OR BACKWARD PROGRESS OR TO SUBCONSCIOUSLY HINT AT THE NATURE OR MOOD OF A SCENE THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY ANY EVIDENCE OF IT SINCE IT'S
OUR ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY WITH ANET GARCIA MAKES ME LOOK FORWARD TO A NEW OZZY MAN WEATHER REVIEW
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
OOOO THEY JUST SWITCHED FROM CONSOLE TO PC TO TREAT THE FOOTAGES
THIS IS GOING TO BE MY EXAMPLE ON WHAT PLAYING ON A MONITOR IS LIKE
THEY FINALLY UPGRADED THEIR GRAPHICS CARD TO INCREASE THE FPS NICE
THEY CAN PUT SATELLITES IN SPACE BUT JUST NOW FIGURED OUT TWEETING
THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS I'VE NEVER BEEN SO FIRED UP ABOUT BLACK AND WHITE IMAGERY IN MY LIFE
THIS SATELLITE IS GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE WEATHER PREDICTION AND CURRENT ANALYSIS MY TOP TWO FAVORITE THIS ABOUT IT ARE THE REAL-TIME LIGHTNING MAPPER AND THE METER RESOLUTION FOR THE VISIBLE IMAGERY PLUS THE POTENTIAL FOR SECOND UPDATED IMAGES
NOT WEATHER AND NOT GEOSTATIONARY BUT IF YOU LIKE HD VIDEOS FROM SPACE SKYBOX HAS A FEW ON YT

WATCH V ZWENCVA

WATCH V OWEN

WATCH V BSW

AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A STILL PICTURE AND WONDERED WHAT WAS SO INCREDIBLE ABOUT IT

THE I REALIZED IT WAS A GIF
SORRY I'M NOT SEEING A BIG DIFFERENCE YES THE FUTURE REFERENCE IS IN SLIGHTLY BETTER FOCUS BUT THE SAME INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN BOTH VIDEOS
ANY CHANCE OF US LOWLY CANADIANS GETTING BETTER WEATHER COVERAGE OUT OF THIS
THEY WILL PROBABLY STILL TELL US IT WILL BE SUNNY SO YOU GO OUT WITHOUT A COAT AND THEN WE HAVE MONSOON LIKE RAIN
I'M SO GLAD ABOUT THIS HONESTLY CURRENT WEATHER FORECASTING IS A JOKE THE SOONER IT CAN BE IMPROVED THE BETTER
HOW DID THEY RECORD THE FUTURE ONE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALREADY POSSIBLE
ISN'T THAT THE VILLAIN FROM GHOSTBUSTERS AL ABOUT TO SUMMON THE MARSHMALLOW MANUAL
CURRENT FORECAST
TOMORROW WE HAVE A CHANCE OF RAIN EITHER IT WILL OR IT WON'T AND WE'RE STILL KEEPING WATCH ON WHERE THE HURRICANE WILL HIT THE COAST IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE FLORIDA OR SOUTH CAROLINA BUT IT MAY SWING NORTH AND GET ANYWHERE FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO MAINE WATCH OUT YOU BIG WHIGS IN DC HAHA

WITH THE NEW IMPROVED SATELLITE THAT GIVES US FASTER PICTURES THE FORECAST WILL BE MORE LIKE THIS
TOMORROW WE HAVE A CHANCE OF RAIN EITHER IT WILL OR IT WON'T AND WE'RE STILL KEEPING WATCH ON WHERE THE HURRICANE WILL HIT THE COAST IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE FLORIDA OR SOUTH CAROLINA BUT IT MAY SWING NORTH AND GET ANYWHERE FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO MAINE WATCH OUT YOU BIG WHIGS IN DC HAHA
DOES THIS MEAN THE CAN GIVE US THE WRONG PREDICTION QUICKER OR THE WRONG PREDICTION IN BETTER DETAIL
I GUESS GETTING THE WRONG PREDICTION OF THE WEATHER IN FLORIDA WILL SOON BE A THING OF THE PAST
IT WAS HARD TO TELL ONE OF THEM WAS HAVING TROUBLE LOADING IT WAS ALL JUMPY
I HAVE A HARD TIME ADMITTING THIS IS AS DESCRIBED AN INCREDIBLE LEAP AN INCREDIBLE LEAP WAS PUTTING AN IMAGE SOURCE IN ORBIT IT SEEMS THE REPLACEMENT IS AN UPGRADE YES BUT NOT AN INCREDIBLE LEAP
SO WHEN DOES THIS FUTURE SATELLITE GO LIVE FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE ACCESS TO IT
WHICH CONTINENTS WILL BE MONITORED AND WHICH MATEO INSTITUTES WILL BE ABLE TO USE THE DATA
IF WE COULD ONLY GET AN UPGRADE LIKE THIS FOR OUR SUN WATCHING SATELLITES
WILL THE PUBLIC BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THESE IMAGES OR WE ARE STUCK WITH THE WEATHERCHANNEL REPORTS THAT USE BRIEF SECTIONS OF IMAGES GATHERED BY THE SATELLITE
DOES THIS MEAN THE WEATHER APP ON MY PHONE IS GOING TO ACTUALLY BE RIGHT ABOUT THE WEATHER LATER ON IN MY SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN I WALK FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS IN PISSING DOWN RAIN WHEN IT SAID IT WAS GONNA BE FUCKING CLEAR SKIES
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN'T REALLY TELL THE INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE
NOW IF ONLY WE COULD GET THEM SOME NEW COMPUTERS TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL THAT IMAGERY

MAGAZINE
SO WHEN COULD WE HAVE COLOR WHIT THIS THERE ARE WAYS TO GET COLOR RIGHT
SO WHAT WAS THE CHALLENGES BEFORE LIKE HOW IT'S HARD TO GET SMOOTH CONTINUOUS SATELLITE FOOTAGE
I THOUGHT WE ALL AGREED BEFORE PIC GOES ON THE LEFT

AND THIS IS REALLY COOL
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A SARCASTIC POST UNTIL I SAW IT MOVE
I THOUGHT THE SECOND ONE WAS MORE CINEMATIC
YOU DON'T NEED ALL THOSE FRAMES
AM I WRONG IN SAYING I KIND OF DON'T LIKE IT LIKE THAT'S JUST NOT WHAT THE WEATHER IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WATCHING HUGE STORMS COME IN WISHING FOR HEAVY RAIN A SNOW DAY AS A KID AND THIS IS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME
I'M SURPRISED IT'S TAKING THIS LONG TO BE HONEST CONSIDERING ALL THE OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES
HEY I GUESS SOMEONE FOUND THE MISSING FRAMES TO GIVE TO THE NEW SATELLITE
WHO WILL HAVE ACCESS TO IT I'M NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE ON HOW SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY MAY OR MAY NOT BE LEASED USED ETC
SO I HOPE APPS LIKE WEATHER RADAR USE THE SATELLITE THEN WE COULD SEE EXACTLY WHEN THE RAIN WILL HIT YOUR AREA
ARE YOU SAYING WE CAN GET LIVE TRAFFIC VIDEO UPDATES NOW FROM SATELLITES
IT LOOKS A LOT SMOOTHER BUT IS THIS REALLY GOING TO HELP METEOROLOGISTS MAKE ANY BETTER PREDICTIONS IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE HIGHER RESOLUTION PROBABLY IS THOUGH JUST HIGHER FPS SEEMS LIKE THIS WOULD ONLY HELP WITH NOTICING CHANGING CONDITIONS SOONER

THATS PROBABLY INHERENT AND I AM STUPID MY BAD
CAN WE WATCH MORE THAN THE SECOND CLIP THAT WE CAN CURRENTLY VIEW ON THE NWS WEBSITE
SOMETHING SOMETHING THE HUMAN EYE CAN'T SEE MORE THAN SOMETHING FPS SOMETHING SOMETHING
I CAN BARELY TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WHAT A GREAT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT
MY MOTHER SENT ME A VIDEO WHILE SHE WAS ON VACATION OF THE ROCKET BEING LAUNCHED IT WAS PRETTY COOL
IS IT JUST ME OR AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO FEELS LIKE WE SHOULD IF HAD THIS A LONG TIME AGO
PLOT HOLE HOW DID THEY GET THE BEFORE IMAGERY IF THE SATELLITE ISN'T FULLY ONLINE YET

CHECKMATE ATHEISTS

GUESSING THERE'S ANOTHER ONE ALREADY ONLINE
SO WHEN I FIRST OPENED IT I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT WAS GIF SO I STARED AT IF FOR LIKE A MINUTE WHILE IT LOADED LOOKING FOR THE DIFFERENCE
THE GOVERNMENT CAN IDENTIFY ME JERKING OFF IN MY BACKYARD HOW COME THIS IS JUST NOW A THING
IF THIS IS FUTURE TECHNOLOGY WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THESE IMAGES A SIMULATION

WHAT AREA OF THE WORLD WILL THIS COVER

HOW MUCH IS THIS ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP IN PREDICTING WEATHER THOUGH UNLESS THERE WAS A MASSIVE LEAP IN PROCESSING POWER AT WEATHER STATIONS TO PROCESS THIS DATA SOMETIMES MORE DATA IS NOT NECESSARILY BETTER
THAT NAMES MAKES ME THINK OF
EXCEPT THAT ITS A GIF MAKING IT UNUSABLE ON ANY AGING PC DOH

QUESTION
WILL THIS LEAP IN IMAGERY AFFECT THE CURRENT LIMIT TO WEATHER FORECASTING

FROM GIF I SEE NO BENEFIT ON PREDICTING WEATHER ONLY A BETTER WAY OF VIEWING PAST AND CURRENT WEATHER ACTIVITY

DOZER THE GOZERIAN DOZER THE DESTRUCTOR DOZER THE TRAVELER VOLVULUS ZILDROHAR AND LORD OF THE SEBOUILLIA
HOW DOES THIS CONTRIBUTE TO WEATHER PREDICTION ARE THE INPUTS THAT WE GATHER BETTER QUALITY FOR OUR WEATHER MODELS
YOU SEE THERE SONNY THATS GLOBAL WARMING SPINNING RIGHT AT OBAMA TOLD ME HIDE IT IN FAKE NEWS STORES
DOZER THE TRAVELER HE WILL COME IN ONE OF THE FORMS DURING THE RECTIFICATION OF THE VULDRINI THE TRAVELER CAME AS A LARGE AND MOVING BORG THEN DURING THE THIRD RECONCILIATION OF THE LAST OF THE MCKITTRICK SUPPLICANTS THEY CHOSE A NEW FORM FOR HIM THAT OF A GIANT FLOR MANY SHIVS AND ZULUS KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO BE ROASTED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE FLOR THAT DAY I CAN TELL YOU
IM DUMB ENOUGH TO THINK THAT SHOWED WINDS IN THE FUTURE BEING TWICE AS FAST DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING LAO
WILL THIS HELP BETTER PREDICT THE WEATHER OR SIMPLY SHOW WHAT'S COMING IN CLEARER FASHION
SOMEONE WILL CREATED AN AI WHICH CONVERTS THE LOW FRAME RATE TO HIGH
I KNOW WHAT IT STANDS FOR BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF DOZER FROM GHOSTBUSTERS EVERY TIME I READ ABOUT THIS
THAT'S AMAZING HOW YOU CAN SEE PARTICULAR LOCATIONS WHERE THE CLOUDS SEEM TO BOIL UP FROM
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY IF A SATELLITE IS ORBITING SO QUICKLY IT IS ABLE TO TAKE A VIDEO LIKE THESE WITHOUT APPEARING TO ORBIT DURING IT
LOOKS BASICALLY THE SAME WASTE OF MONEY WHEN THERE ARE STRUGGLING FAMILIES OUT THERE THAT COULD PUT IT TO BETTER USE
SURPRISED SOMEONE HASN'T DONE AN EDIT OF THIS GIF REPLACING CURRENT WITH CONSOLE AND FUTURE WITH PC
TOO LAZY FOR SARCASM OR WIT SO I'LL JUST EXPRESS MY GRAND EXCITEMENT SWEET FUCKING TECHNOLOGICAL JUMP WEATHER CONVERSATIONS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
WORD CLOUD OUT OF ALL THE COMMENTS HETP

I HOPE YOU LIKE IT
SO NASA FINALLY UPGRADES FROM PROCESSORS NASA ACTUALLY DID USE A PS PROCESSOR FOR THE PLUTO PROBE
HOW DANGEROUS HOW DANGEROUS THE FUTURE WILL BE WITH THE PEOPLE GAINING MORE AND MORE ACCESS TO FUTURE TECHNOLOGY

MUHHAHAHAHAMUUHAHAHAHMUHAHAHAMUHHHAAHAH
AAA JUST LIKE THE DIFFERENCE IN FRAME RATE AFTER USING INTEL HD GRAPHICS AND LATER INSTALLING A RADION INVIDIA
WAKE UP PEOPLE THIS IS A SPY SATELLITE SURE IT CAN IMAGE THE WEATHER NICELY BUT IT CAN ALSO STREAM FOOTAGE OF YOU BALLING FAT CHICKS FROM THE ASSUMED PRIVACY OF YOUR MOTOR HOME
IT'S LIKE PC MASTER RACE GAMING ON THE LEFT AND CONSOLE GAMING ON THE RIGHT
IN THE LEFT HERE YOU CAN SEE WHAT LOOKS LIKE AND IN THE RIGHT YOU CAN SEE WHAT LOOKS LIKE C MASTERRACE
THEY COULDN'T UPGRADE THE THING TO COLOR NASA LOVES TO SKIMP ON THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ANY PROJECT
IN THE FUTURE THEY WILL GET THE SHAPE OF WISCONSIN COMPLETELY WRONG ON WEATHER MAPS SEEMS UNLIKELY
BOT BEEP BEEP I'M ALL ABOUT TOP POSTS

THIS POST HAD UPVOTES AND GOT POSTED TO TWITTER AND SUBREDDIT R REDDIN

THE TWEET



ALL UPVOTES ARE ON AND R REDDIN

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ALL POSTS ON AND R REDDIN
NOW THAT I SEE THIS I'M KIND OF SURPRISED WE DON'T HAVE THIS ALREADY WTF SMART PEOPLE WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG
LOOKS BASICALLY THE SAME WASTE OF MONEY WHEN THERE ARE STRUGGLING FAMILIES OUT THERE THAT COULD PUT IT TO BETTER USE
NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW THIS WILL HELP PREDICT THE WEATHER BUT DEFINITELY LOOKS AWESOME
THIS IS COOL AND SORRY TO BE A DICK ABOUT IT BUT HONESTLY IT'S AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GETTING SATELLITE IMAGING LIKE THIS A LONG TIME AGO
I ALMOST BOOKMARKER THIS AS WE ARE ALL GOING TO BING DIE LOL

THOUGHT THIS WAS A PREDICTION OF THE EFFECTS OF RISING GLOBAL TEMP ON OUR CURRENT WEATHER PATTERS SWEETS JESUS THANK BABY BURT REYNOLDS ITS JUST SCIENCE COIN ITS HAG ON METEOROLOGICAL IMAGERY GOING TO GO MAKE SUM CHAMOMILE TEA AND WATCH THE SNOW FALL SLOWLY AND PEACEFULLY NOW O
SO BASICALLY THE OLD SATELLITE WAS A CONSOLE PEASANT AND THE NEW ONE IS FROM PC MASTER RACE
LIVE BREAKING NEWS PROTESTS IN PORTLAND MONDAY NIGHT PROTESTS
WATCH V
THERE ARE OBJECTS CALLED STANDARD CANDLES THAT ARE USED TO MEASURE DISTANCES YOU CAN READ ABOUT THEM AND OTHER METHODS HERE

THE REDSHIFT IS THE SHIFT TOWARDS THE RED END OF THE SPECTRUM OF SPECTRAL ABSORPTION LINES NOT THE LIGHT IN GENERAL ALTHOUGH THAT SHIFTS AS WELL YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT THAT HERE
REDSHIFT IS TYPICALLY DETERMINED FROM MEASURING THE FREQUENCY WAVELENGTH OF EMISSION OR ABSORPTION LINES FOR EXAMPLE EXCITED HYDROGEN GAS IN GALAXIES EMITS THE H EMISSION LINE WITH A REST WAVELENGTH OF NANOMETERS THE REDSHIFT IS DETERMINED FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBSERVED AND REST WAVELENGTH
THE THUMBNAIL SHOWING WOMAN AMONG MEN MADE ME QUITE CONFUSED AT THE TITLE IS THIS VISUAL CLICKBAIT
HERE'S AN IDEA HOW ABOUT RATHER THAN SENDING WOMEN WE SEND THE BEST PEOPLE FOR THE JOB MEN WOMEN OF JAPANESE AMERICAN RUSSIAN ETC ORIGIN
ARE THEY TRYING TO SEE IF THEY'RE UP TO THE TASK IF THEIR CYCLES ALL GO IN SYNC
IMAGINE HOW MUCH FASTER THE SPACE PROGRAM HAPPENED IF THERE WAS A PLANET WITH WATER AND GREENERY ON IT RIGHT FREAKING THERE
IMAGINE WHAT THE TIDES WOULD BE LIKE ON THE LITTLE ONE AND HOW OFTEN THE ECLIPSES WOULD BE
FUN FACT

TECHNICALLY PLUTO AND CHARON ARE IN A BINARY PLANETARY SYSTEM MUCH LIKE THE ONE IN THIS GIF
JUST A FEW OBSERVATIONS ASSUMING THE BIG PLANET IS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE EARTH

THEY COMPLETE ONE ORBIT IN ABOUT HOURS SO EACH DAY IS ALSO HOURS

THE SMALL PLANET IS CLOSE TO THE ROCHE LIMIT THESE TWO PLANETS MIGHT BE OK BUT THEY SHOULD BE ELONGATED DUE TO TIDAL FORCES ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER ONE

ALTHOUGH TIDAL FORCES ARE EXTREME IN THIS SYSTEM THERE ARE NO TIDES BECAUSE NEITHER PLANET ROTATES RELATIVE TO THE OTHER

THE PLACE WHERE YOU WOULD WEIGH THE LEAST IN THIS SYSTEM IS ON THE NEAR SIDE OR FAR SIDE OF THE SMALLER PLANET ON THE FAR SIDE CENTRIFUGAL ACCELERATION IS TRYING TO FLING YOU FROM THE SYSTEM YOU'RE MOVING TOO FAST IN YOUR ORBIT AND ON THE NEAR SIDE THE GRAVITY FROM THE LARGER PLANET PARTLY CANCELS THE SMALL PLANETS GRAVITY YOU'RE MOVING TOO SLOW IN YOUR ORBIT YOU WILL WEIGH THE MOST AT THE POLES OF THE LARGER PLANET

THEY ARE FULLY ILLUMINATED SO THE SUN IS DIRECTLY BEHIND THE VIEWER AT EQUINOX THE SYSTEM WILL BE SIDE ON TO THE SUN AND YOU'LL GET ECLIPSES EVERY HOURS OR SO IF THE ORBITAL POLE IS IN THE UP DIRECTION THEN IT'S CURRENTLY SUMMER IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERES ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE ORBITAL POLES ARE TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT THEN THE SYSTEM IS BETWEEN EQUINOX AND SOLSTICE AND AT SOLSTICE THE SUN WILL REMAIN MOTIONLESS IN THE SKY AT ONE CELESTIAL POLE AND ONE HALF OF EACH PLANET WILL BE IN CONSTANT ILLUMINATION
VIDEO OF ACTUAL BINARY DWARF PLANETS
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING IF THEY SHARED A THICK ATMOSPHERE DUE TO BEING IN SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY IN SUCH A SITUATION BACTERIA AND POTENTIALLY EVEN FLYING ANIMALS INSECTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET FROM ONE PLANET TO THE OTHER SIMPLY BY FLYING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM IT WOULD ALSO INCENTIVIZE EVOLUTION TO HAVE AN ORGANISM GAIN THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND A LOWER ATMOSPHERE AND POTENTIALLY RESISTANCE TO COSMIC RADIATION
IMAGINE THE CRAZY LOOKING CHICKS YOU'D GET TO BONE FROM THE NEIGHBOR PLANET
THAT BIG ONE IS GONNA HAVE SUCH A SHITTY CLIMATE BASED ON THE POSITION OF THOSE CONTINENTS AND SEAS SEND ME TO THE SMALL ONE

IF THIS IS TO SCALE THESE PLANETS ARE IN THEIR FINAL DEATH SPIRAL EITHER THEY WOULD CRASH INTO EACH OTHER DECADES OR THE LARGER ONE WOULD RIP THE SMALLER TO SHREDS FROM THE TIDAL FORCES FORMING A RING AROUND THE LARGER THIS WOULD NOT BE A STABLE ORBIT

WOULD BE THE CLOSEST ANALOG IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM

FUN GRAVITY SIMULATOR FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT
NOW THIS IS MORE LIKE IT BADASS TREK FAN JUST MAKES MY SCIENCE BONE TINGLE
HOW DOES IT DIFFER FROM A PLANET AND ITS MOON IS THE CRITERIA FOR IT THAT ONE BODY MUST BE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER
I RECOMMEND THE LIGHT POLLUTION MAP HTTPS HERE YOU CAN SEE PLACES THAT ARE NOT TOO BRIGHT AT NIGHT
IT'S BETTER TO SEE IT ON SUMMER THOUGH BECAUSE THEN YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEE THE CORE OF MW AND NOT ITS ARM JUST LIKE THIS
I'M NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN WHAT YOU MEAN BY BUT SETI COMES TO MIND
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY SPONSORED IN A SCIENTIFIC WAY OR SPONSORED BY SCIENCE THE LATTER WOULDN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO ME AS THEIR IS NO OVERARCHING AUTHORITY TO SCIENCE THAT COULD HAND OUT GRANTS THERE ARE HOWEVER A COUPLE OF PROGRAMMES IN THE WORLD THAT SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE IN A SCIENTIFIC WAY SETI BEING THE MOST FAMOUS YOU CAN YOURSELF PARTICIPATE HERE
THE ONGOING SCIENCE CAMPAIGN ON MARS HAS AS ONE OF ITS OBJECTIVES SEEING IF THERE IS OR WAS LIFE THERE
MOST OF THE UNIVERSE IS COMPLETELY FULL OF THINGS THERE IS SO LITTLE EMPTY SPACE IT BOGGLES THE MIND

TAKE FOR INSTANCE LIGHT WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE ON A NIGHT WITH CLEAR SKIES AND LOOK UP YOU SEE STARS MAYBE YOU MIGHT SEE DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN FOR ALL I KNOW PHOTONS FROM THAT STAR HAVE COME FROM THAT STAR AND ARE ENTERING YOUR EYES AND YOU CAN SEE THE STAR IF YOU MOVE OVER FIVE FEET OR FIFTY MILES YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT SAME STAR PHOTONS FROM THAT STAR ENTERING YOUR EYES REGARDLESS WHERE YOU LOOK AT IT FROM YOU'LL SEE THE LIGHT FROM THAT STAR

THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS THAT MEANS THAT EVERYWHERE OUTSIDE THAT STAR IS THAT STAR'S LIGHT WAVES PARTICLES WHATEVER EVERYWHERE IS FILLED WITH THE LIGHT GIVEN OUT BY THAT STAR AND THAT LIGHT IS CONTINUOUS NO GAPS OR HOLES SO THAT SPACE IS COMPLETELY FULL OF THAT STAR'S LIGHT EXCEPT IN SHADOWS OF COURSE BUT THAT'S ONLY FOR THE PRESENT MOMENT WHEN THAT STAR'S LIGHT IS CUT OFF BY SOMETHING AND NOT JUST IN THE PRESENT BUT COMING IN JUST A SECOND OR TEN OR DAYS OR YEARS LATER ALL OF SPACE IS FILLED IN EVERY DIRECTION WITH THE LIGHT FROM THAT STAR NOW MULTIPLY THAT BY THE NUMBER OF STARS

AND THIS IS JUST LIGHT

SPACE IS A LOT OF THINGS BUT EMPTY NOPE
WAS THIS WRITTEN BY A FEMINIST I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE ARTICLE BECAME ABOUT NOT PHYSICS LIKE IF THEY CONTRIBUTED PLEASE SHARE WHAT IT WAS BUT LEAVE OUT THE AD HOMINEM OUT WHATEVER ARGUMENT
THERES ALREADY R SPACE WHICH IS AN ESTABLISHED AND POPULAR COMMUNITY WITH INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION WHATS THE POINT OF THIS

EDIT CHECKED POST HISTORY I UNDERSTAND NOW YOU ASKED A RETARDED QUESTION AND IT GOT REMOVED FOR BEING DUMB AS SHIT AND NOT FOLLOWING THE LOCAL RULES ANYWAY SO YOU'RE UPSET
OR YOU COULD JOIN R SPACE WHICH IS ONE OF THE BEST SUBS ON THIS WEBSITE IN TERMS OF CONTENT AND WHERE RULES PREVENT IT FROM BECOMING A PILE OF CRAP
I ASSUME THAT'S THE LANDER AFTER IT WAS DOWN I LOOKS LIKE ITS WITHOUT THE LOWER STAGE UNLESS THEY FOLDED IT WELL
YOU KIND OF ASSUME EVERY HUMAN LIVES ON ONE SIDE OF EARTH AND BEING PEDANTIC WE CAN ONLY SEE A LITTLE OVER HALF OF ONE SIDE SO IT'S EVEN LESS SO YEAH

THOUGH I GET YOUR POINT AND IT'S AMAZING NONETHELESS BUT THEN AGAIN FOR THAT STATEMENT I PREFER THE PALE BLUE DOT
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A FUN FACT BUT IF YOU GET A CAMERA YOU CAN DO THIS TOO
IF I LAY FLAT ON MY BELLY ON A MOUNTAIN THAT STATEMENT IS PROBABLY TRUE ALSO
BILLION IN BILLION ALMOST YEARS LATER MILLIONS GROWING SO TECHNICALLY ILLITERATE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF HALF A CENTURY AGO LOOK LIKE MAGIC AND TRICKERY IT WAS DECIDED IN TO SEEK EXTINCTION ON THE LITTLE BLUE BALL RATHER THAN BECOME AN INTERPLANETARY SPECIES THE DIRECTIVE WAS LOOK DOWN AT THE GROUND AND IT IS FORBIDDEN TO LOOK UP ANOTHER YEARS TO EVEN HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF KEEPING A HUMAN APE ALIVE ON MARS MUCH LESS GIANT TROUPES BY THEN THE CHAOTIC GLOBAL WARMING WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY THE MOST BLOCK HEADED DUNDERHEADS IF THERE IS GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR IN THE MEANTIME THE EXTINCTION COMES EVEN FASTER THE HUMAN APE FAILS THE IQ TESTAMENT
NOPE LOTS WERE NOT EVEN BORN WHEN THIS WAS TAKEN AND A WHOLE PILE OF THEM HAVE DIED BEFORE IT WAS DONE AS WELL
IN THE POPULATION WAS BILLION IN IT IS BILLION THE POPULATION DOUBLED IN LESS THAN YEARS AND EVEN THOUGH THE BIRTH RATE HAS DROPPED WILL DOUBLE AGAIN IN YEARS DOUBLE THE POPULATION MEANS DOUBLE THE CONSUMPTION NEEDS OF EACH HUMAN APE MORE AIR MORE WATER MORE FOOD MORE CLOTHING MORE TRANSPORTATION ALL CONSUMING THAT THIN LAYER THAT MAKES POSSIBLE

WITH BILLION POPULATION IN YEARS THERE WILL BE A VERY NARROW WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY WOO WHERE THE HUMAN APE BECOMES AN INTERPLANETARY SPECIES CROSSES OVER FROM A TYPE I CIVILIZATION TO A TYPE 2 CIVILIZATION THAT HAS STOPPED FOSSIL FUEL AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND APPROACHING ZERO POPULATION GROWTH WITH INDEFINITE LONGEVITY OTHERWISE IF THE WOO IS MISSED THE HUMAN APE GOES FROM A TYPE I CIVILIZATION TO A TYPE CONTINUES BURNING FOSSIL FUELS BECAUSE THEY ARE CHEAPER KEEP REPRODUCING 2 OR MORE CHILDREN PER GENERATION DEPLETES CRITICAL RESOURCES WATCH VEGETATION DIE OFF FROM DROUGHT AND DISEASE DUE TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS IT IS THE SHEEPLESS CHOICE AND THEY HAVE BEEN TENDING TO BEET THEIR VOTE LATELY CHOOSING THE LATTER

I'VE TAGGED YOU AS COGENCY SHILL YOUR LINK HISTORY IS COGENCY
CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON R SPACE NEW FOR CRAZY COMMENTS

I DOUBT THE YELLOWSTONE CALDERA IS SOMETHING YOU CAN RELIEVE PRESSURE OF ITS TOO BIG CERTAINLY NOT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE FOR A SMALL SMALL CHANCE OF AN EVENT
BY THAT LOGIC LITERALLY ANYTHING CAN BE TALKED ABOUT HERE BECAUSE IT'S ALL IN SPACE TO YOUR CREDIT I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER PLACE TO POST IT THOUGH I THINK YOU RUN INTO COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF SUCH AN ACTION RISKING WILDFIRES AND SMOKE CHOKING THE AIR ON TOP OF RISKING SETTING THAT BEAST OFF YOURSELF MAGMA POOLS BUILD UP PRESSURE UNDER THE SURFACE AND WHEN THE PRESSURE OVERCOMES THE WEAKEST POINT CONTAINING THAT PRESSURE IT BLOWS SPEWING LAVA IN EVERY DIRECTION I THINK YOUR IDEA WOULD COMPROMISE IT'S SEAL AND RAIN HELL ON US ALL
THIS PLAN DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH EXPLOSIONS

YOUR APPLICATION FOR FUNDING OF ARMAGEDDON 2 HAS BEEN DENIED
IMAGINE YOU'VE GOT A TUMOR THE TUMOR IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON YOUR VITAL ORGANS UNFORTUNATELY THE TUMOR IS FAR TOO LARGE TO JUST REMOVE

DOES POKING HOLES IN IT HELP
I HAD A LOVELY HAM SANDWICH TODAY

THE SANDWICH ORIGINATED ON EARTH EARTH IS IN SPACE THEREFORE THIS IS TECHNICALLY SPACE RELATED VIA BREAD SALAD HAM AND WHAT IS BEST DESCRIBED AS
AN ERUPTION OF THE YELLOWSTONE SUPERVOLCANO WOULDN'T COME ANYWHERE NEAR KILLING EVERYONE IN NORTH AMERICA LET ALONE EVERYONE ON EARTH IT WOULD SUCK CERTAINLY BUT IT'S ERUPTED MANY TIMES BEFORE AND WE KNOW HOW BIG A POP IT WOULD BE BASED ON OLD ASH STRATA

HERE'S AN ARTICLE MODELING PREDICTIONS OF YELLOWSTONE ASHFALL MUCH OF NORTH AMERICA DOESN'T EVEN GET A FULL CENTIMETER ALSO THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT AN ERUPTION IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN ANY TIME SOON WE'RE FINE

IF AN ERUPTION WERE IMMINENT THOUGH THERE'S NOT REALLY ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE VENTING THE PRESSURE ISN'T REALLY A THING THAT CAN BE DONE ON A PRACTICAL SCALE GASSES DON'T DIFFUSE THROUGH MAGMA VERY RAPIDLY SO THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT TO RELEASE THEM WOULD BE TO SET OFF THE ERUPTION YOU'RE TRYING TO PREVENT BEST BET WOULD BE TO JUST EVACUATE THE STATES THAT WOULD BE MOST SEVERELY HIT MAKE SURE EVERYONE IN THE STATES HAVE SHOVELS AND KNOW THEY'LL NEED TO WEAR A CLOTH OVER THEIR FACES WHILE KEEPING THE ASH FROM ACCUMULATING ON THEIR ROOFS AND SEE THAT A GOODLY STOCK OF PRESERVED FOOD IS AVAILABLE TO DEAL WITH A YEAR OR TWO OF TERRIBLE CROPS
IT'S PROBABLY IN THE BEST INTERESTS FOR THE REST OF THE SPECIES OF THIS WORLD IF IT BLEW UP AND RESULTED IN OUR EXTINCTION BEFORE WE KILL OFF EVERYTHING ELSE
THAT'S SOME PRETTY SERIOUS CLICKBAIT YOU GOT GOING THERE

IF YOU READ PAST THE HEADLINE MOST OF THE LINKS GO TO THE AUTHOR'S OWN SITE AND THE ONLY PRIMARY SOURCE HE PROVIDES IS INGRAHAM AND CITIZENS FOR THE REPUBLIC COMPLAINING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLAR GRANT TO SOLARCITY FROM BACK IN PAINTING THIS AS TRUMP GOING AFTER SPACE IS QUITE THE STRETCH
THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST WORRIED THAT SPACE WILL NOTICE THAT THE EARTH ISN'T FLAT WHEN THEY GET WAAAF UP THERE
EXCEPT THAT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP OTHERWISE WE'D BE HEARING FROM BREITBART WHO DON'T SEEM TO HAVE JUMPED ON THE BANDWAGON DESPITE BEING HEADED BY LITERAL CHIEF PROPAGANDIST
THIS IS COMPLETE AND UTTER BS TRUMP IS A UUGE SUPPORTER OF SPACE AND THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF THINKING HE'S TRYING TO PUSH

EDIT MUSK HIMSELF JUST STATED THAT THESE ARE FAKE PIECES AND THE WRITERS ARE SIMPLY TROLLS
COULD WE PLEASE HAVE ONE FRIGGING SUBREDDIT NOT DEDICATED TO TRUMP
KOCH BROTHERS ARE BEHIND ALL OF THIS NOT TRUMP TRUMP IS A PUPPET LIKE THE REST
THE CONSERVATIVES LARGEST OPPONENT GEORGE SOROS RECENTLY GOT INVOLVED WITH TESLA THROUGH THE SOLAR CITY DEAL I'D IMAGINE THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS

GREAT TIP

ASTRONOMY CLUB INDEX FOR THE US HETP
AWESOME TIP I'M CONSIDERING BUYING A PRETTY PRICEY TELESCOPE I'M TRULY NEW TO COSMOLOGY AND SKYGAZING THIS MIGHT BE A SOLID WAY TO TEST OUT SCORES ABS BAKE IN A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE TOO

THANKS OP
I THINK OF THE UNIVERSE AS INFINITE AND GENERALLY FLAT IT HAS NO BOUNDARY AS EXISTENCE AS IT WERE CAN BE DEFINED AS REGIONS WHERE SPACETIME AND MATTER EXIST THERE IS NO OUTSIDE OF THAT BECAUSE YOU CANNOT REACH A POINT WHERE YOU ARE BEYOND THAT AND LOOKING BACK TO IT AT LEAST NOT IN OUR ACCESSIBLE DIMENSIONS

YOU COULD THOUGH IMAGINE THE UNIVERSE AS A HYPERSURFACE OF A STRUCTURE OR PLANE FROM THIS OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE ANY CREATURES OF THIS HIGHER DIMENSION COULD OBSERVE THE ENTIRETY OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE BOUNDARIES IF ANY AS WELL AS INTERACTING WITH DIFFERENT TIMES AND AREAS AT WILL SEEMINGLY POPPING IN AND OUT OF EXISTENCE

SO IN SUMMARY I WOULDN'T THINK OF THIS IN TERMS OF BEYOND BUT RATHER THE NEXT LEVEL UP I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE
WELL JUST A FEW DAYS AGO I HAD MADE A COMMENT ON ANOTHER POST RELATED TO THIS TOPIC

I'LL GO AHEAD AND ADD A FEW PARTS FROM IT BELOW AS IT MIGHT BE A BIT HELPFUL IN THIS DISCUSSION PERHAPS



INFINITE UNIVERSE

THERE ARE SOME WHO BELIEVE THE CURRENT UNIVERSE IS INFINITE IN SIZE AND THAT OUR BIG BANG WAS JUST A LOCAL INFLATION EVENT WITHIN THAT GREATER INFINITE SPANNING UNIVERSE

THAT MEANS A LOT OF STUFF HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER PARTS OF THIS INFINITE UNIVERSE BEFORE OUR LITTLE INFLATION EVENT AN INFINITY OF TIME EVENTS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE US

ACCORDING TO ESSENTIALLY WHATEVER YOU CAN IMAGINE HAPPENING IN A UNIVERSE HAS INDEED HAPPENED BEFORE INCLUDING COPIES OF YOUR SELF EXISTING IN THOSE FAR-DISTANT PARTS



2 BUBBLE UNIVERSES

OTHERS SAY THAT OUR BIG BANG CREATED OUR ISOLATED LITTLE UNIVERSE BUBBLE WITHIN A VAST SEA KNOWN AS THE THAT IS SEETHING CONSTANTLY WITH OTHER BUBBLE UNIVERSES POPPING IN AND OUT OF EXISTENCE CONSTANTLY

IF SO THEN IT'S POSSIBLE THE FABRIC OF THE GREATER HAS IT'S OWN ISOLATED SPACE-TIME DIMENSIONS THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM OUR OWN SPACE-TIME DIMENSIONS

SO ESSENTIALLY YOU'VE GOT AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE AND DIFFERENT SPACE-TIME EXISTING OUTSIDE OF OUR UNIVERSE'S SPACE-TIME WHICH ALSO GIVES RISE TO COUNTLESS OTHER UNIVERSES



WE'RE LIVING INSIDE A BLACK HOLE

STILL OTHERS SAY THAT OUR CURRENT OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE IS THE BOTTOM OR THE INTERIOR OF A BLACK HOLE AND THAT THE BIG BANG WAS THE MOMENT THE BLACK HOLE WAS CREATED

THIS MEANS THERE IS NOW A WALL ISOLATING US FROM THE REST OF THE UNIVERSE SINCE WE CAN'T SEE OUTSIDE THE EVENT HORIZON OF THE BLACK HOLE THAT WE ARE STUCK INSIDE OF AND THEY CAN'T SEE US

IF TRUE THAT THUS MEANS WE HAVE OUR OWN SPACE-TIME AND THE MAIN PART OF THE UNIVERSE HAS IT'S OWN SPACE-TIME UNFOLDING THAT MAKES US A KIND OF BRANCHING SPACE-TIME OR MOVING DOWN A DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE TEMPORAL PATHWAY FROM THE MAIN SPACE-TIME



IN SHORT

SO YA THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE FASCINATING AND SOMEWHAT SCIFI SOUNDING PLAUSIBLE THEORIES ABOUT WHAT MAY LIE OUTSIDE OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE

AND OF COURSE THE QUESTION YOU ASK WILL BE FULLY ANSWERED

FOR EXAMPLE IF WE FIND PROOF THAT THE BUBBLE INDUCING LIES OUTSIDE OF OUR UNIVERSE THEN YOU MAY ASK WHAT IS BEYOND THE

AND IF WE THEN GO FURTHER AND DISCOVER THAT SOMETHING CALLED XYZ LIES BEYOND THE THEN YOU WILL ASK WHAT LIES BEYOND XYZ AND SO ON AND SO ON

IN OTHER WORDS IT'S TURTLES ALL THE WAY DOWN

BUT YES STILL IT'S A FASCINATING QUESTION YOU ASK AND PONDERING THAT QUESTION LEADS TO NEW POSSIBLE INSIGHTS INTO PHYSICS EVEN IF IT WILL BE A NEVER-ENDING FRACTAL KIND OF QUESTION THAT IS NEVER FULLY ANSWERED

THIS QUESTION HAS ALWAYS INTERESTED ME LITERALLY ANYTHING COULD BE BEYOND THE UNIVERSE THE UNIVERSE COULD JUST BE AN ELECTRON ZOOMING AROUND A HYDROGEN ATOM BOUND TO 2 OXYGEN IN THE TEAR OF A CRYING BABY IN ANOTHER DIMENSION IT BLOWS MY MIND
DON'T THINK OF IT AS BEYOND CONSIDER ALL THE INBOUND PHOTONS SOME PHOTONS COME FROM THINGS WE CAN SEE THEN THERE ARE PHOTONS FROM THE CB BUT THERE ARE ZERO PHOTONS COMING FROM FARTHER AWAY

ZERO NOT A SINGLE INBOUND PHOTON HAS EVER ARRIVED FROM FATHER AWAY OR FARTHER BACK IN TIME IF YOU PREFER

THERE'S A REASON WHY WE CALL IT THE KNOWN UNIVERSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUTSIDE OF IT
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IS BEYOND THE KNOWN UNIVERSE BEYOND MIGHT NOT EVEN MAKE SENSE IN THIS CASE AS FAR AS WE KNOW THERE COULD BE A MULTIVERSE WITH MULTITUDES OF BUBBLE UNIVERSES OF VASTLY DIVERSE CONFIGURATIONS SPRINGING INTO AND ENDING EXISTENCE ALL THE TIME FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER WORD
INFINITE SPACE
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THE COASTLINE INSIDE THE CRATER IS STILL INTACT
THIS IS THE PAPER THE IMAGE IS REFERRING TO FREELY AVAILABLE AT RESEARCHGATE
SADLY HE FORGOT ONE THING THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A CENTRAL REBOUND CONE IN IMPACTS THOSE ON THE MOON SHOW THE MOST OF THOSE TOO

WHERE'S THAT HERE
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE AMAZING TO BEHOLD FROM WITHIN THE VALLEY IN-BETWEEN CIRCULAR MOUNTAIN RANGES
WHY SHOULDN'T NASA DO CLIMATE CHANGE THIS IS JUST A RED HERRING TO CUT CLIMATE CHANGE FUNDING IF PEOPLE WANTED TO REORGANIZE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH THEY WOULD SAY THAT THEY WOULD EXPLAIN HOW ALL OF CLIMATE CHANGE EFFORTS ARE GOING TO BE MOVED OVER INTO NOAA COMPLETE WITH THE BUREAUCRATS AND SCIENTISTS WHO RUN THOSE PROGRAMS WITH BUDGETS UNCHANGED

BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING

IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO BOOST MANNED SPACE EXPLORATION THEY COULD JUST ANNOUNCE THEY'RE INCREASING MANNED SPACE BUDGET THERE'S NO NEED TO MENTION CLIMATE SCIENCE IT'S NOT LIKE NASA CAN'T WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME

BUT THEY'RE NOT SAYING THAT EITHER

WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO IS TO CUT CLIMATE SCIENCE TO MAKE BROWNIE POINTS WITH THEIR VOTERS AND TO USE THE RUSE OF FOCUSING ON SPACE EXPLORATION AS BAIT FOR THE GULLIBLE
ITS NOT LIKE THE NASA EARTH SCIENCE IS A THING ON WHEELS THAT YOU CAN JUST ROLL DOWN THE STREET TO NOAA IT IS AN ORGANIZATION OF PEOPLE THAT WORK AT PLACES LIKE GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER AND THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY WHERE WOULD THOSE PEOPLE WORK NOW WHAT EMPTY NOAA FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE COMPLETE WITH ALL OF THE THE LABORATORIES AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE

2 EARTH SCIENCE AND PLANETARY SCIENTISTS LEARN FROM EACH OTHER MANY SCIENTISTS WORK ON BOTH TYPES OF MISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DEVELOPED FOR EARTH SCIENCE OFTEN END UP ON PLANETARY SCIENCE MISSIONS AND VICE VERSA YOU GAIN ECONOMIES OF SCALE BY LEAVING THEM TOGETHER

NOAA SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE TECHNICAL WORKFORCE TO DEVELOP NEW REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES NASA DOES SO LETS SAY YOU LEAVE THE ENGINEERS AT NASA RIP OUT ALL THE SCIENTISTS AND MOVE THEM OVER TO NOAA WAIT A FEW YEARS FOR THEM TO REBUILD THEIR LABS AND FOR THE DUST TO SETTLE NOW WHAT YOU'VE BROKEN THE LINK BETWEEN ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER UNDER THE NASA ROOF

THEY AREN'T GOING TO SHIFT FUNDS TO NOAA THAT IS A SMOKESCREEN THEY WANT TO CUT CLIMATE SCIENCE BUDGETS AT NASA NOAA NSF AND DOE THE GOP WANTS TO GUT NASA EARTH SCIENCE THE MOST BECAUSE NASA IS A TRUSTED NAME BRAND WHEN IT COMES TO SCIENTIFIC RESULTS
LAO DID YOU KNOW THAT NOAA GETS A TON OF ITS DATA FROM NASA

DID YOU KNOW THAT THE CHALLENGES SOLVED FOR SPACEFLIGHT PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY CAUSAL OF EARTH SCIENCES ADVANCEMENTS NOT TO MENTION GIANT ECONOMIC RETURNS

DID YOU KNOW THAT IF WE PUT OF OUR RESOURCES TOWARDS SPACE IS NONSENSE AS NASA USES SPACECRAFT FOR CLIMATE SCIENCE RESEARCH OR THAT NASA GETS LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF THE US BUDGET IF WE ACTUALLY PUT ALL OUR RESOURCES TOWARDS EXPANDING THE SPACE FRONTIER WE SIMPLY COULDN'T BECAUSE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS FALTERED AND THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH ENGINEERS ON EARTH TO ACTUALLY MAKE USE OF OF OUR RESOURCES FOR SPACE
WHEN THE OTHER SIDE IS FULL OF NEONAZIS GIVING THE NAZI SALUTE SAYING HAIL TRUMP AND SPRAY PAINTING SWASTIKAS ON EVERYTHING I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING THEY SAY AND BELIEVE THEY THE BEST INTENTIONS FOR THE GOOD OF ALL MANKIND
THE VERY VERY LAST THING NASA NEEDS IS TO BECOME EVEN MORE POLITICIZED

THERE IS ALREADY A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH MAJOR LONG TERM PROJECTS AT NASA THEY TEND TO GET CANCELLED WHEN ADMINISTRATIONS CHANGE THEY'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT THROWING OUT THE WORK DONE ON SLS AND STARTING OVER THERE IS NO WAY ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR NASA DON'T MAKE THIS EVEN WORSE STARTING FROM SCRATCH EVERY YEARS WILL ENSURE NASA NEVER GOES ANYWHERE
SORRY BUT THE GLASS IS NOW BEING POURED OUT ONTO THE DROUGHT-STRICKEN GROUND HOW MUCH SPACE EXPLORATION CAN WE ACCOMPLISH BEFORE CLIMATE CHANGE DECIMATES CIVILIZATION STUPID STUPID STUPID PLAN BY THE GREATEST SMARTEST SMARTEST SO HE SAYS GREATEST BUSINESS MAN IN HISTORY GOD HELP US CAUSE TRUMP LOOKS LIKE HE'S INTENT ON DESTROYING IT ALL
SO NOUN A SOUTH A BECOMES AMERICAN SPACE AGENCY

LET THE UN OR EUROPE PICK UP THE AERONAUTICS AND WEATHER RESEARCH

IT'S ALSO ONLY A REDUCTION IN BUDGET B TO

IT'S TIME TO THE SPACE PROGRAM
GET READY FOR THE COPYCAT POSTS FOLKS BOTH MISSIONS TWEET THESE OUT DAILY NONE OF US REALIZED A SCREENCAP OF ONE OF THOSE TWEETS WAS WORTH KARMA
WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IF YOU COULD RING A PHONE NUMBER AND GET A RECORDED MESSAGE SAYING HOW FAR AWAY VOYAGER IS
WHICH UPDATES AUTOMATICALLY
AT THE TONE THE VOYAGER PROBE WILL BE LIGHT HOURS FROM EARTH
I COULD ENVISION A MISSION IN SOME FUTURE DATE TO BRING BACK VOYAGER FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES LIKE FOR A MUSEUM

BY THAT POINT THE SHIP WOULD HAVE LONG LOST IT'S POWER AND OTHER SHIPS THAT GREATLY EXCEEDED IT'S SPEED WOULD HAVE PASSED IT IN DISTANCE

NOT IN MY LIFETIME I GUESS BUT ONE DAY PERHAPS


WOW THAT WAS FAST JUST SAW AN ARTICLE MINUTES AGO THAT SAID IT WAS HRS AND MINUTES AWAY IN LIGHT SPEED TIME MUST HAVE TELEPORTED OR BROKE THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
THE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT WHAT IT REALLY IS ARE INTERESTED IN THE FACTS NOT WILD SPECULATION THE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT WILD SPECULATION ARE NOT THE KINDS OF PEOPLE YOU WANT RUNNING A PR CAMPAIGN TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT SPACE

THERE IS A MYSTERY YES BUT MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ODD DATA INDICATES A DYSON SPHERE OR ANY SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT IS INCREDIBLY DAMAGING AS IT CONVEYS THE IDEA THAT SCIENTISTS MAKE WILD ASSUMPTIONS AND THEY DO NOT

BESIDES WHICH THERE IS ALREADY A MASSIVE AND EFFECTIVE PR CAMPAIGN TO GET PEOPLE INTERESTED IN REAL SPACE AND REAL SCIENCE THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL VIDEO MINUTES OF TERROR SPRINGS TO MIND THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WE AS A CULTURE DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF THING CULTURALLY WE'RE MORE FOCUSED ON GOSSIP AND FASHION AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF GOOD EFFORT IN THAT AREA MYTHBUSTERS FOR EXAMPLE BUT THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO AND THE EFFORT NEEDS TO BE SUSTAINED THINGS IS NOT GOING TO HELP PLUS EVEN IF WE DO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO CALL IT A BIEBER SPHERE YEAH TERRIFYING I KNOW

AND FINALLY A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH INFORMS ME THAT KC ALREADY HAS A NICKNAME STAR WHICH YOU CAN FIND HERE

WIKI KC
GARBAGE NAMES ARE CONFUSING AND CAN LEAD TO MISTAKES JUST LIKE IN CHEMISTRY THERE ARE COMMON NAMES THAT SOMETIMES CAN BE MISTAKEN FOR OTHER THINGS AND THERE ARE THE DUPARC ACCEPTED NAMES THAT ARE EXACTING AND UNMISTAKABLE
WE TRIED THAT WE TRIED NAMING ASTEROIDS AFTER MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURES AS WE DISCOVERED THEM WE RAN OUT OF NAMES LONG BEFORE WE RAN OUT OF OBJECTS THE MINOR PLANET CENTER HAS A DATABASE OF MILLION OBJECTS EVEN WHEN THEY CUT IT DOWN TO THE ONES WE CAN CALCULATE AND ORBIT FOR AND FIND AGAIN THERE ARE STILL IT IS POINTLESS TO ASSIGN A NAME TO SOMETHING BEFORE YOU KNOW ITS OF VALUE BUT YOU STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO REFER TO IT SO IT GETS A SCIENTIFIC DESIGNATION LATER IF WE DECIDE THEY ARE OF INTEREST WE ARE GOING BACK AND NAMING SELECT ONES
THOUGHT IT WAS A METEORITE IT WASN'T

UH THEN WHAT THE FUCK IS IT
THAT'S THE CONTRAIL OF A JET BEING ILLUMINATED BY THE SUN IT LOOKS SUPER BRIGHT BECAUSE HIS CAMERA IS ADJUSTED FOR THE DARKNESS
NOW WAIT A SECOND I THOUGHT THAT NATURAL OCCURRING EVENTS CAN'T POSSIBLY COINCIDE WITH EACH OTHER
IT'S AN AIRPLANE ILLUMINATED BY THE SUN FROM BELOW THE HORIZON YOU CAN SEE IT PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY SHORTLY BEFORE SUNRISE AND AFTER SUNSET CASE CLOSED
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A METEOR TO ME LOOKS LIKE IT'S MOVING FAR TOO SLOW TO BE THAT PROBABLY THE CONTRAIL FROM A PLANE
ISN'T IT CONSIDERED A METEOR UNTIL THERE IS A FRAGMENT ON THE GROUND THAT YOU WOULD CALL A METEORITE OR DO I HAVE THIS WRONG
WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING AGAINST GRAVITY AND WHY IS IT MOVING SO SLOW
WHOA A VIDEO WHERE THE PERSON FILMING ISNT A FUMBLING SHAKING MESS AND KEEPS THE CAMERA CENTERED ON THE OBJECT
I HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF METEORITES IN MY LIFE NEVER ONE THIS SLOW

SPACE JUNK ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE
THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION IS DONE MY TECHNICIANS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN ENGINEER WHO'S JOB IT IS TO MAKE SURE CONSTRUCTION GOES SMOOTHLY AND ACCORDING TO PLAN A DESIGN ENGINEER WILL NEVER TOUCH A BOLT OR TOOL THE SUPERVISING ENGINEER FOR THE BUILD MIGHT
EVERYBODY THAT GOES TO ENGINEERING SCHOOL THINKS THEY WILL BE A DESIGNER THE DESIGNER IN ANY FIELD IS AN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE AND LIMITED EMPLOYMENT AREA THE DESIGN ENGINEER IS LIKE THE NFL QUARTERBACK BOEING USUALLY HAS A PRINCIPAL PHD SENIOR SYSTEMS ENGINEER THAT MAINTAINS THE OVERALL ENVELOPE OF THE DESIGN DETERMINING SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENTS STAYING UP WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY TO INCORPORATE FOR PERFORMANCE GAIN AND INCREASING PROFIT THE ACTUAL INITIATOR FOR THE DESIGN IS THE MARKET THIS LINK IS A PRETTY GOOD READ ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT ENDED WITH THE PRODUCTION ONE ENGINEER WORKING HIS WAY UP AS A WING DESIGN EXPERT



THE REALITY IS DESIGN ENGINEERS ARE LIKE ROCK STARS AND MOST OTHER ENGINEERS STAY GARAGE BANDS THEIR WHOLE CAREER IN ROCKETRY THE ENGINES WERE FOR MISSILES FIRST AND IT WAS ABOUT MACHINING ON A GIGANTIC SCALE THERE STILL IS A LOT OF GIGANTIC MACHINING AND WELDING GOING ON BUT IT IS A LOT MORE AUTOMATED NOW EVERYTHING IS DESIGNED CAD CAM THESE DAYS SO THERE ARE FAR FEWER AND PROTOTYPES FEM ANALYSIS DECREASES THE NEED FOR PHYSICAL DESTRUCTIVE TESTING THE COMPONENTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES COME FROM ALL OVER SPECIALIZED LITTLE MACHINE SHOPS MAKING CONNECTORS WIRING HARNESSES TUBING FITTINGS ETC IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY THERE ARE ALWAYS ASSEMBLY AREAS IN MOST CASES SEPARATE COMPONENTS ARE ASSEMBLED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY OR WORLD THEN THE COMPONENTS ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER AT THE MAIN ASSEMBLY AREA THE BIG BUILDING THE ROCKET WHEELS OUT OF BEFORE LAUNCH
ONCE THE ENGINEERS DESIGN IT SOME FACTORY SOMEWHERE PROBABLY PRODUCES EVERYTHING HOWEVER WHERE THERE IS A FACTORY THERE ARE ENGINEERS

SOURCE ALSO AN MASCULINE EAST STUDENT SO TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT YOU MIGHT ALSO TRY R ASKASCIENTIST
DESIGNING SPACECRAFT SOLVES ENGINEERING PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO DESIGNING JET PLANES BECAUSE ROCKET SCIENCE COMES DOWN TO DESIGNING POWERFUL FUEL PUMPS AND VESSELS THAT WITHSTAND HIGH PRESSURE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES WHILE PUMPING LIQUID FUEL INTO A COMBUSTION CHAMBER IT GETS TRICKIER WITH SUPERSONIC SPEEDS DUE TO MUCH MORE VIBRATIONS BEYOND THE SOUND BARRIER NEWTONIAN PHYSICS OF ORBITAL TRANSITS IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE COMPARED TO THAT

SPACECRAFT MANUFACTURING IS USUALLY OWNED BY COMPANIES WHO MANUFACTURE JET PLANES
SPACECRAFT USUALLY ARE WORTH INVESTING IN REFINING HIGHER GRADE ALUMINUM AND CLEANER ENVIRONMENTS



OTHER PROBLEMS COME WITH CONDENSATION AND FREEZING OF STORED LIQUIDS IN ENVIRONMENTS THIS IS COMPLEX AND STILL BEING RESEARCHED A LOT IT IS EASIER DO DO FOR A FEW WEEKS ON A TRIP TO THE MOON AND HARDER TO MAINTAIN FOR YEARS IN LOW EARTH ORBIT IT CAN CAUSE REAL PROBLEMS WHEN STORING WATER OXYGEN FUEL FOR LIFE SUPPORT

ANOTHER EASILY MISSABLE ISSUE IN SPACE IS COOLING LOW DENSITY OF SPACE MEANS YOU CAN COOL SOMETHING BY EMITTING INFRARED AS YOU CAN NOT TRANSFER MUCH HEAT BY CONDENSATION THIS MEANS TO COOL A SPACE STATION IN ORBIT YOU NEED NEARLY AS MUCH SURFACE FOR COOLING AS YOU NEED FOR SOLAR PANELS
HOW DOES THE FASTER THE RING ROTATE EQUATE TO THE MORE MASSIVE THE RING IS

IF THE STRUCTURE WAS ROTATING NEAR LUMINAL SPEEDS IT WOULD INCREASE IN MASS BUT THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCES WOULD SURELY RIP IT APART MOREOVER THAT INCREASE IN MASS DOESN'T EQUATE TO AN INCREASE IN MATTER SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU THINK THAT STAR WOULD BE DIMMED MORE BY A FASTER SPINNING DYSON RING
AS LONG AS NO ROVERS NAMED THE EDMUND FITZGERALD TRY TO CROSS IT SHOULD BE OK
AERIAL SCANNING SHOWED BURIED ICE FEET DOWN

UH HUH SO X-RAY I THINK NOT
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO TALK TO CASSIE THE LEAD AUTHOR ON THIS PAPER ON THE MOST RECENT EPISODE OF MY PODCAST IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE
YOU HALF EXPECT TO SEE AND COME AROUND THE SIDE OF THAT HILL
TO THINK THAT I AM LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE OF A PLANET THAT IS BARELY A SPECK IN THE NIGHT SKY AMAZING
CUT FROM THIS ORIGINAL IMAGE THAT WAS PIECED TOGETHER BY A GENTLEMAN NAMED SEAN OVER AT UNMANNEDSPACEFLIGHT
GIVEN THE TITLE I KEPT WAITING TO SEE A ROVER CROSS THE SCREEN THEN I REALIZED IT'S NOT A GIF
IT'S GOING TO BE EPIC ONCE HUMANS GET TO MARS ALTHOUGH THE SECESSION WARS WON'T BE ALL THAT AWESOME
I ALWAYS WONDER WHEN I LOOK AT PICTURES LIKE THESE ON MARS IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE REAL THING OR SOME GOOD ARTICLE I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID BUT IT'S SO AMAZING I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE SURFACE OF THIS PLANET
THIS IS WHAT A NEW CRATER LOOKS LIKE IT WAS CREATED BETWEEN AND PHOTO BY THE ARO

THE CRATER SPANS APPROXIMATELY FT IN DIAMETER AND IS SURROUNDED BY A LARGE RAYED BLAST ZONE BECAUSE THE TERRAIN WHERE THE CRATER FORMED IS DUSTY THE FRESH CRATER APPEARS BLUE IN THE ENHANCED COLOUR OF THE IMAGE DUE TO REMOVAL OF THE REDDISH DUST IN THAT AREA DEBRIS TOSSED OUTWARD DURING THE FORMATION OF THE CRATER IS CALLED EJECTA IN EXAMINING DISTRIBUTION SCIENTISTS CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT THE IMPACT EVENT THE EXPLOSION THAT EXCAVATED THIS CRATER THREW EJECTA AS FAR AS MILES

SOURCE
NASA HAS NAMED THE CRATER JOHN THAT'S RIGHT IT'S JOHN CRATER OF MARS
SEEING THIS REMINDS ME OF THE TIME I VISITED BARRINGER CRATER IN ARIZONA AS YOU'RE DRIVING ACROSS MILES OF DESERT ON THE ROAD TO THE CRATER THERE'S NOT MUCH TO LOOK AT BUT EVENTUALLY YOU SEE THE RIM OF THIS MASSIVE CRATER RISING OUT OF THE DESERT FLOOR IT'S A PRETTY AWESOME SPECTACLE TO SEE STANDING ON ONE EDGE AND LOOKING ALMOST OF A MILE TOWARD THE OTHER SIDE AND DOWN ABOUT STORIES TO THE BOTTOM THE MOST INTERESTING THING TO ME AFTER LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE METEOR THE IMPACT AND THE CRATER WAS THE DRIVE BACK OUT WHERE BEFORE I SAW A BARREN BLEAK AND TOTALLY UNINTERESTING DESSERT I NOW SAW THE HUGE BOULDERS UNDULATING GROUND AND DEBRIS FIELD FROM THE EJECTA SPREADING OUT FOR MILES AND MILES ALONG THAT ROAD BACK TO THE HIGHWAY

WIKI IMAGES THUMB F
PRETTY COOL PICTURE IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THE PICTURE IN NATURAL COLORS NOT ENHANCED I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT IF THEY WERE ON MARS THIS IS WHAT THEY WOULD SEE
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND MARS HAS A WEAKER ATMOSPHERE THAN EARTH WOULDNT THINGS LIKE METEORS BE A LARGER PROBLEM THAN ON EARTH WOULD THAT IMPACT THE COLONIZATION OF MARS AT ALL
COULD MATERIAL FROM THE SURFACE OF MARS BE LAUNCHED INTO SPACE FROM THIS SIZED IMPACT
HOW FREQUENT ARE THESE WILL IT POSE AT ACTUAL RISK FOR THE FIRST VISITORS
SO WITH ATMOSPHERE DRAG ETC ETC WHAT WOULD A FT IMPACT DO TO A MAJOR CITY AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS EXAMPLES PLEASE WHILE I GO BUILD MY BUNKER

I WONDER IF WE'LL GET TO SEE IT AT SURFACE LEVEL IN OUR LIFETIME EITHER WITH A ROVER OR WITH HUMANS
DIDN'T SEE IF THIS HAS BEEN COVERED ALREADY BUT IS THERE A WAY TO DETERMINE HOW BIG THE OBJECT WAS BEFORE IT HIT THE SURFACE
COULD THE NEGATIVE SPACE BETWEEN THE EJECTA LINES TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE IMPACT OBJECT
WHAT DOES FRESH MEAN HOW OLD IS THIS CRATER HOURS DAYS MONTHS OR IS IT UNTOLD THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD BUT GEOLOGICALLY FRESH

SECOND IF IT IS FRESH IN TERMS OF DAYS TO MONTHS OLD HOW FAR AWAY ARE OPPORTUNITY AND CURIOSITY COULD THEY GET THERE BEFORE A LOT OF THE VOLATILES BLEW AWAY
PRETTY SURE THAT'S A MR MEESEEKS THAT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL FOR TOO LONG
JUST THE UNIVERSE CRASH LANDING IT'S LIFE RAFT DOWN ON A NEW PLANET HERE GUYS NOTHING TO SEE MOVE ALONG
QUICK THOUGHT MAYBE SOMEONE CAN HELP ME OUT WITH THIS IF THIS JUST HAPPENED RECENTLY AND OTHER PLANETS ARE GETTING HIT LIKE THIS I'M ASSUMING HOW COME EARTH HASN'T I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED THIS BUT PROBABLY MISSED WHY IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
MUST BE THAT EUROPEAN SPACE PROBE THAT DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR MARS COLONY WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH UNLIKE THEY WOULD HAVE TO ON EARTH KIND OF TERRIFYING ACTUALLY
IT'S KIND OF ODD TO THINK THAT WE KNOW THE SURFACE OF MARS BETTER THAN WE KNOW THE FLOORS OF OUR OCEANS

WE SUCCEEDED IN TAKING THAT PICTURE AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT YOU SEE A DOT THAT'S HERE THAT'S HOME THAT'S US ON IT EVERYONE YOU EVER HEARD OF EVERY HUMAN BEING WHO EVER LIVED LIVED OUT THEIR LIVES THE AGGREGATE OF ALL OUR JOYS AND SUFFERINGS THOUSANDS OF CONFIDENT RELIGIONS IDEOLOGIES AND ECONOMIC DOCTRINES EVERY HUNTER AND FORAGER EVERY HERO AND COWARD EVERY CREATOR AND DESTROYER OF CIVILIZATIONS EVERY KING AND PEASANT EVERY YOUNG COUPLE IN LOVE EVERY HOPEFUL CHILD EVERY MOTHER AND FATHER EVERY INVENTOR AND EXPLORER EVERY TEACHER OF MORALS EVERY CORRUPT POLITICIAN EVERY SUPERSTAR EVERY SUPREME LEADER EVERY SAINT AND SINNER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR SPECIES LIVED THERE ON A MOTE OF DUST SUSPENDED IN A SUNBEAM

THE EARTH IS A VERY SMALL STAGE IN A VAST COSMIC ARENA THINK OF THE RIVERS OF BLOOD SPILLED BY ALL THOSE GENERALS AND EMPERORS SO THAT IN GLORY AND IN TRIUMPH THEY COULD BECOME THE MOMENTARY MASTERS OF A FRACTION OF A DOT THINK OF THE ENDLESS CRUELTIES VISITED BY THE INHABITANTS OF ONE CORNER OF THE DOT ON SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE INHABITANTS OF SOME OTHER CORNER OF THE DOT HOW FREQUENT THEIR MISUNDERSTANDINGS HOW EAGER THEY ARE TO KILL ONE ANOTHER HOW FERVENT THEIR HATREDS OUR POSTURINGS OUR IMAGINED SELF-IMPORTANCE THE DELUSION THAT WE HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED POSITION IN THE UNIVERSE ARE CHALLENGED BY THIS POINT OF PALE LIGHT

TO MY MIND THERE IS PERHAPS NO BETTER DEMONSTRATION OF THE FOLLY OF HUMAN CONCEITS THAN THIS DISTANT IMAGE OF OUR TINY WORLD TO ME IT UNDERSCORES OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL MORE KINDLY AND COMPASSIONATELY WITH ONE ANOTHER AND TO PRESERVE AND CHERISH THAT PALE BLUE DOT THE ONLY HOME WE'VE EVER KNOWN CARL SAGAN SPEECH AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY OCTOBER

HERE'S A DUMB QUESTION IS THE EARTH EASIER TO SPOT FROM MARS NOW THAN IT WAS YEARS AGO DUE TO ALL THE LIGHTS IN IT SURFACE
SO IF YOUR PLANET DIED OR YOU KILLED IT AND COULD SEE ANOTHER PLANET CLOSE ENOUGH THAT YOU MIGHT BE SAVED AND YOU HAD SUFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY TO PULL OFF INTERPLANETARY FLIGHT WOULD YOU DO IT
SO IS NO ONE ELSE GOING TO ASK WHY THIS IMAGE IS BLUE THE ORIGINAL IS BLACK-AND-WHITE WHERE IS THIS COLOR INFORMATION COMING FROM
EVERY HUMAN BEING FLOWER BLADE OF GRASS PIECE OF SAND FISH WHALE BOAT ARGUMENT CAR ROLLERBLADE SUSHI RESTAURANT RIOT CUCUMBER WHOLE FOODS GUITAR BLOWJOB HELICOPTER SHOE LACE BENTO BOX DENTAL FLOSS SHEEP DOG SHITTY MOVIE ELBOW DROP JANYE WEST RANT MASS EXTINCTION RELIGION GNATS ETC

ALL THAT SHIT IS IN THAT TINY FUCKING SPECK OF LIGHT
WALLPAPER WITHOUT THE BLUE FILTER IMAGER LINK HETP

IT'S BEEN MY WALLPAPER FOR MONTHS I DON'T LIKE THE FILTER WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL YOU CAN REALLY PICTURE YOU THERE YOU ALMOST FEEL THE SOLITUDE AND SILENCE OF IT
IS THERE A WAY TO ORDER A PROFESSIONAL PRINT OF THIS OR THE SIMILAR SUNSET ON MARS ONE
IMAGINE YOU CAME TO MARS DIDN'T LIKE IT THERE

YOU'RE LOOKING INTO THE SKY AND THINK THE NEXT SPACE ITS IS IN 2 YEARS
THIS MAKES ME WONDER WHAT PHOBOS AND DEIMOS LOOK LIKE FROM THE SURFACE OF MARS
I CAN SEE MY HOUSE FROM HERE

AND MY FRIEND'S HOUSE

AND ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY

I SEE A LITTLE DOT IN A PHOTO AND IF I NEVER READ THE CAPTION I WOULD NEVER HAVE SPOTTED THAT DOT BUT STILL I FEEL INTENSELY HOMESICK WHEN LOOKING AT IT
I OPENED UP THIS PICTURE AS WAS LIKE WHERE'S EARTH I SAW A BUNCH OF WHITE SPECKS THAT I THOUGHT WERE STARS AND WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE OF THEM COULD BE EARTH

I SCROLLED DOWN TO GET A FULL VIEW OF THE PICTURE AND THE SPECKS MOVED WITH IT


THE SPECKS WERE DUST ON MY MONITOR FM
LOOK AGAIN AT THAT DOT THAT'S HERE THAT'S HOME THAT'S US ON IT EVERYONE YOU LOVE EVERYONE YOU KNOW EVERYONE YOU EVER HEARD OF EVERY HUMAN BEING WHO EVER WAS LIVED OUT THEIR LIVES THE AGGREGATE OF OUR JOY AND SUFFERING THOUSANDS OF CONFIDENT RELIGIONS IDEOLOGIES AND ECONOMIC DOCTRINES EVERY HUNTER AND FORAGER EVERY HERO AND COWARD EVERY CREATOR AND DESTROYER OF CIVILIZATION EVERY KING AND PEASANT EVERY YOUNG COUPLE IN LOVE EVERY MOTHER AND FATHER HOPEFUL CHILD INVENTOR AND EXPLORER EVERY TEACHER OF MORALS EVERY CORRUPT POLITICIAN EVERY SUPERSTAR EVERY SUPREME LEADER EVERY SAINT AND SINNER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR SPECIES LIVED A MOTE OF DUST SUSPENDED IN A SUNBEAM

SAGAN WAS A POET BEYOND HIS YEARS
RIGHT I CAN'T SEE THE EARTH AND THERE'S A DEAD PIXEL ON MY SCREEN
I IMAGINE NASA WHEN TAKING THE PHOTO WAVE YOUR HAND BY THE WINDOW TO SEE IF ITS US
WHY WE CAN'T SEE THE SAME SKY WITH THOUSAND OF STARS AS IN EARTH WHY THERE AREN'T STARS IN THAT VIEW
HORIZON PROMINENTLY VISIBLE IN THIS BACKGROUND ILLUMINATION CLEARLY MARKING OUTLINES AND COLLECTIVELY GIVING A BROADER VISION ABOUT THE INFINITE SPAN OF THE UNIVERSE
BEAUTIFUL REMINDS ME OF THIS
IS THE FILTER TO MAKE IT LOOK CLOSER TO TRUE COLOUR OR IS IT TO MAKE IT PRETTY
THE SPECS OF DUST ON MY SCREEN MAKE IT LOOK LIKE STARS ACROSS THE PICTURE
I LOVE DARK BACKGROUNDS AND I JUST SET THIS AS MY WALLPAPER IT LOOKS OOOO GOOD THANKS TO WHOEVER THE CREDITS GO TO
YOU ME EVERYONE YOU'VE EVER KNOWN SEEN OR WILL KNOW ALL EXISTS ON THAT PALE BLUE SPECK
WHY IS THE ATMOSPHERE BLUE I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE THAT ON EARTH BECAUSE OF THE OXYGEN
IF THAT DOESN'T PUT YOUR PROBLEMS INTO PERSPECTIVE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILLIAM
FOAH TOTALLY CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE ON HOW DIRTY MY SCREEN IS THIS WAS LIKE A WHERE'S WALDO OF TINY GREY SPECKS
IS THE ATMOSPHERE REALLY THAT BLUE OR IS IT TAKEN IN SOME SORT OF FALSE COLOR
THE FIRST HUMANS TO LAND ON MARS WILL LOOK BACK AT THE EARTH AND GO INTO A PANIC ATTACK ASKING THEMSELVES WHAT HAVE THEY DONE
JUST THE FACT THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO THIS IS ASTONISHING TO ME THIS ALSO MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT WE ARE SO INSIGNIFICANT TO THE WHOLE PICTURE ITS UNBELIEVABLE
SPACE COPS HERE COME SPACE COPS SPACE TRIAL ON TRIAL GUILTY OF BEING IN SPACE GO TO SPACE JAIL
THAT'S FRAKEN RIGHT WE'RE INSIGNIFICANT
AND PEOPLE STILL DON'T BELIEVE IN ALIENS
IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY SURREAL TO LOOK THROUGH A TELESCOPE AND SEE EARTH
I HAD TO BASICALLY PLAY FIND THE DOT WITH MY PHONE SCREEN SINCE IT'S COVERED IN DIRT
ALL OF THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS IN THAT TINY LITTLE SPEC DAMN THAT IS JUST MIND BOGGLING
I WOULD THINK THAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO LIGHT POLLUTION THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE WAY MORE STARS WHY DOES THE SKY LOOK SO BARREN
IT FUCKS ME UP KNOWING THAT I VERY WELL MAY HAVE BEEN AT WORK FLIPPING PATTIES WHEN THIS WAS TAKEN
SOMEWHERE IN THAT TINY SPECK OF BRIGHT PIXELS

IS A GUY GETTING A BLOWJOB LET THAT SINK IN
IT BOTHERS AND AMAZES ME SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT I AM TECHNICALLY IN THIS PHOTOGRAPH
WOW I THINK THIS IS MY FAVOURITE SPACE IMAGE EVER IT REEKS OF LONELINESS THAT'S NOT WHY IT'S MY FAVOURITE BEDAUBS I ALREADY REALISE HOW INSIGNIFICANT WE PROBABLY ARE BUT THIS REALLY DRIVES IT HOME

IT ALSO MAKES ME FEEL SORRY FOR THOSE POOR LONELY ROVERS I LIKE TO THINK THAT THEY'RE ALL PROGRAMMED TO MEET UP ONCE IN A WHILE
WHY IS THE PICTURE BLUE I THOUGHT THE BLUE ON EARTH WAS CAUSED BY HIGH AMOUNTS OF NITROGEN IS IT THE SAME ON MARS
WHY DO WE SEE EARTH EYE NAKED BUT NO STARS

WITH THE RIGHT ANGLE BETWEEN SUN MARS EARTH CAN WE SEE MARS AS A LITTLE DOT AS WELL ISN'T IT HIDDEN BETWEEN ALL THE MORE VISIBLE STARS
I'M ALWAYS AMUSED BY THESE POSTS COULD BE ANYTHING REALLY NO OTHER INFORMATION IS GIVEN IT'S JUST A DOT IN THE SKY COULD BE ANYTHING AT ALL
THIS REMINDS ME OF SPACE BALLS WHEN LONESTAR SHOWS VESPA DRUIDIC IN THE DESERT
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I'M SURE MANY OF US ARE ASTRONOMERS IMAGINE THE FEELING OF USING YOUR SCOPE TO LOOK AT A TINY EARTH AND MOON AGAINST THE BLACKNESS OF SPACE
THIS MAKES ME THINK OF THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES AND WHAT BRADBURY MUST HAVE IMAGINED WHEN HE WROTE ABOUT EARTH UNDER NUCLEAR WAR
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE LONELINESS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE AN ASTRONAUT CRAZY BEING THAT FAR FROM HOME WITH ONE WAY BACK THAT MIGHT TAKE MONTHS AND MONTHS PRETTY SCARY

DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY BODIES LOOK SO SMALL AT HIGH NOON AND THEN SO LARGE AT THE HORIZON
LOOKS RATHER UNASSUMING LIKE OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SKY BUT WE KNOW HOW MUCH BEAUTY AND LIFE IT HOLDS I WONDER HOW MANY MILLIONS OF PLANETS HOST BEAUTY OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE
YOU KNOW I ALWAYS LIKED THE BOOKS FROM BURROUGHS AND I EVEN ENJOYED IT SEEMS LIKE I AM THE ONLY ONE THE MOVIE ADAPTION OF THE FIRST BOOK IN THE MOVIE THEY DEPICTED THE EARTH AND MOON TO BE MUCH CLOSER AND EASILY SEEN LIKE WE CAN SEE THE MOON FROM THE EARTH I ALWAYS KNEW THAT IN ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE LIKE SEEING MARS AS A BRIGHT STAR BUT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MOVIE MAGIC MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE FANTASY WAS COOL

I JUST HATE THE FACT THAT I WAS BORN TO LATE THAT I COULD NOT EXPLORE THE LAST PLACES OF EARTH AND TOO SOON THAT I CAN NOT EXPLORE THE GALAXY


IS THERE A PICTURE OF JUPITER FROM MARS I BET IT'S PRETTY DAMN BRIGHT
I HAD TO WIPE THE DUST PARTICLES OFF MY SCREEN TO SEE THE RIGHT DOT
IT WILL BE A WONDERFUL DAY WHEN MARS HAS ITS OWN TELESCOPE THAT PEOPLE LOOK UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY WITH AND SEE EARTH HUMANITY'S HOME PLANET
THIS REMINDS ME OF THE PALE BLUE DOT BY CARL SAGAN

THAT DOT IS ALL OF US ALL HUMANITY ALL THE STORIES THE GOOD THE BAD
EVERYTHING HAPPENED ON THAT DOT
NO MATTER WHAT PLANET YOU LOOK AT EARTH FROM IT'S A PALE BLUE DOT
IT'D BE COOL IF WE HAD A RING CAN WE MAKE AN ARTIFICIAL ONE AT SOME POINT
WELL I'VE YET AGAIN SAT HERE FOR A FEW MINUTES REALIZING EVERY COMPLAINT I'VE EVER HAD WAS MINUSCULE
WE HUMANS THINK WE'RE SO HIGH AND MIGHTY WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY AND CIVILIZATION THIS IS A SOMBRE REMINDER THAT WE ARE A LITTLE FISH IN A VERY VERY BIG POND
SO WHY CAN YOU SEE EARTH FROM MARS AND YOU CAN TELL IT'S A PLANET BUT FROM EARTH LOOKING AT MARS IT LOOKS LIKE A STAR
THIS PICTURE MADE REALIZE HOW DUSTY MY MONITOR WAS THERE WERE MANY EARTHS ON MY SCREEN
HOW LONG DOES LIGHT TAKE TO TRAVEL FROM EARTH TO MARS LOOKING UP AT THE STARS YOU KNOW YOU'RE SEEING LIGHT FROM BILLIONS OF YEAR AGO LOOKING AT THE EARTH FROM MARS OR MARS FROM EARTH HOW OLD IS THAT LIGHT
AS AN ASPIRING PHOTOGRAPHER AND LOVER OF SCIENCE AND EXPLORATION PICTURES LIKE THIS MAKE ME WANT TO GO TO MARS JUST TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST MARTIAN PHOTOGRAPHERS
THIS BOGGLES MY MIND HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I STOOD OUTSIDE AT NIGHT LOOKING UP AT THE RED GLOWING STAR OF MARS AND HERE I AM LOOKING AT EARTH FROM MARS

ALSO I KIND OF EXPECTED EARTH TO HAVE A BLUER GLOW
DOESN'T MARS APPEAR BIGGER AND CLEARER TO SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE FROM EARTH THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND GOING BY THIS PICTURE
I ALWAYS LOVE SEEING PHOTOS FROM MARS AND OTHER PLANETS BECAUSE HOLY CRAP THAT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PLANET IT'S SO WONDROUS AND AWE-INSPIRING
I THOUGHT EARTH WOULD BE ALMOST AS BRIGHT FROM MARS AS VENUS IS FROM EARTH SINCE IT'S STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO THE SUN
PRETTY MIND BLOWING TO THINK IN THAT PALE DOT ARE BILLIONS OF PEOPLE DOING PEOPLE THINGS BEING BORN DYING FUCKING FIGHTING HAVING EPIPHANIES DOING DRUGS WONDERING WHAT'S FOR DINNER SHUFFLING ALONG IN THEIR DAILY ROUTINES
I WONDER IF ANY OF THE PHOTONS THAT BOUNCED OFF ME ARE IN THIS PICTURE
I ALLAYS LOVE TO IMAGINE THAT THEIR IS CIVILIZATION ON MARS AND WE BOTH KNEW ABOUT IT FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
AT FIRST I WAS STARING IN AWE AT A SMALL DOT IN THE CENTER OF THE PHOTO THEN I REALIZED IT WAS A PIECE OF DUST ON MY MONITOR THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE
I CAN SEE MY HOUSE

OH YEA THATS BECAUSE I AM IN MY HOUSE
THOUGHT IT WAS A SPECK OF DIRT ON MY PHONE ZOOM IN OH SHIT YEP THERE IT IS
I'M WONDERING WHY THERE AREN'T MORE STARS IN THE SKY I IMAGINE THERE IS ZERO LIGHT POLLUTION THERE SO THEY SHOULD BE CLEARLY VISIBLE CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THAT
WHY AREN'T THERE ANY STARS VISIBLE IF THE ANSWER IS JUST REFLECTED AMBIENT LIGHT INTERFERENCE I'LL BE DISAPPOINTED
AS I LOOK AT THAT TINY BRIGHT SPEC REALIZING THATS WHERE IVE BEEN MY ENTIRE LIFE I WONDER WHAT EXACTLY I WAS DOING AT THAT EXACT MOMENT
IS THE HIGHEST DEFINITION WE HAVE OF THIS IMAGE THE PICTURE IN THE LINK
STUPID QUESTION
IS THAT THE REAL COLOR OF DUSK DAWN SKY ON MARS THIS PIC IS AS PROFOUND AS PALE BLUE DOT TO ME
DUST DUST DUST CAT HAIR DUST IS THAT IT NO DUST SMUDGE DUST WAIT OH THERE IT IS
TO ME THE MOST MILD-BLOWING THING ABOUT ALL THIS SPACE STUFF IS THAT HOW DO THEY MANAGE TO GET HD PHOTOS FROM A TINY ROBOT FROM ANOTHER PLANET MILLIONS OF KILOMETERS AWAY
DAMN THIS GIVES ME AMAZING CHILLS AND MAKES MY EYES WATER A LITTLE MAKES YOU THINK ALLOT ABOUT THE MADNESS THAT IS GOING ON HERE ON EARTH COMPARED TO THE SILENT BLUE OF THIS THIS MARS PHOTO
THERE IS NO WAY I'LL EVER SEE A MAN WALKING DOWN THERE

MY CHILDREN WILL
I CAN SEE THE EARTH IN THIS PICTURE ALSO ITS A SHADE OF BLUE

IM ON MOBILE SO IT COULD BE THAT
THIS IMAGE GIVES ME FURTHER APPRECIATION OF THE VOYAGER PALE BLUE DOT THE DIFFERENCE IN DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS STAGGERING AND FROM MARS WE SEEM LIKE A PALE DOT I UNDERSTAND THE CAMERAS USED WERE MUCH DIFFERENT AND USING LONG EXPOSURES AND SLEWING MADE PBD POSSIBLE
OBLIGATORY PALE BLUE DOT REFERENCE
AS MEN BORN TO THE EARTH WE DREAM OF VISITING THE STARS

AS MEN BORN TO THE STARS WE WILL DREAM OF RETURNING HOME
WE'RE JUST A LITTLE DOT ON THE SURFACE OF THAT FROZEN SKY THAT REALLY PUTS THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE I'M MORE THANKFUL FOR EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE AFTER SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOW
FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW HOW COULD ANYONE NOT EXPECT LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS
YUP AND TO THINK WE'RE KILLING THAT TINY LITTLE PLANET AND WONT HAVE ANYONE TO LOOK AT IT ONCE WE COMPLETELY IT UP WITH GLOBAL WARMING
LIFE ON EARTH IS STUPID THEY HAVE BEEN TEACHING IT TO US FOR YEARS IT'S JUST A STUPID BLUE SPOT NOTHING ELSE SOME SAY THEY HAVE CANALS OR OCEANS HAHA HOW CAN YOU HAVE BLUE OCEANS WHEN MARS IS RED

I THINK THE EARTHIAN WILL ATTACK US WE SHOULD PREPARE

LOOK LOOK AN EARTHIAN PROBE

RUN RUN
IMAGINE THE RELIGIONS THAT COULD HAVE EVOLVED FROM THIS BEING YOUR NIGHT SKY WITH A POINT OF LIGHT THAT HAS ANOTHER THAT CLOSELY FOLLOWS AND CIRCLES IT AND I WONDER HOW MUCH FASTER PEOPLE WOULD HAVE FIGURED OUT GRAVITATION
I'M GLAD MY MONITOR IS THE MOON IS QUITE CLEAR ONCE YOU ZOOM IN

IT'S ALSO AMAZING TO KNOW THAT ALL THE PLANETS CAN FIT BETWEEN THE EARTH AND MOON HOW FREAKING TINY ARE WE
WHERE DOES THE GLOW NEAR THE HORIZON COME FROM ON EARTH THAT'S USUALLY THE ATMOSPHERE DUST ZODIACAL LIGHT
SOMEONE MAKE A WRITING PROMPT FOR A THOUSAND YEAR OLD HUMAN MARTIAN COLONY THATS SOMEHOW LOST CONTACT WITH EARTH BUT STILL HAS AN ORAL TRADITION OF TELLING STORIES OF THE OLD WORLD THE TINY BLUE DOT IN THE SKY
MARTIAN NO LIFE THERE ITS TOO WET WHO COULD LIVE WITH ALL THAT WATER AND CARBON MY SUPREME BEING ALL THESE CRAZY PEOPLE AND THEIR TAILS OF EARTHLINGS THAT THING OVER THERE WEATHER BALLOON WITH WHEELS
I FEEL SMALL IT REMINDS ME OF THAT COMIC STRIP ABOUT THE ROVER BEING ALL ALONE AND IT MAKES CRY
KINDA LIKE MOST PEOPLE IN MY CITY'S DREAMS DARK WITH CHANCE OF LACK OF EARTH RELEVANCE
AFTER SEEING MANY FALSE EARTHS I UNDERSTAND THAT I REALLY NEED TO CLEAN MY SCREEN
FUCKING MIND BLOWING IMAGINE IF YOU WERE ON MARS NOW AS IF A COPY OF EARTH BUT NEITHER PLANET HAD ESTABLISHED MEANS TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT EACHOTHER

YOU LOOK UP AND THAT TINY TINY DOT IN SPACE SUCH AN INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE THING LIKE ANY OTHER DOT VISIBLE YOU MAY PAUSE AND WONDER WHAT'S THERE OR YOU MAY BRUSH IT OFF ALONG WITH THE COUNTLESS OTHER DOTS IN YOUR VIEW

YET ON THAT TINY TINY DOT HOLDS UNTOLD BILLIONS OF TRIUMPHS MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS AND SADNESS OF VICTORY AND DEFEAT OF RESEARCH AND SLANDER OF PROGRESS AND ATROCITY OF PEACE AND WAR AND OF LOVE AND HATE YET ALL THIS SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THAT DOT IS ONE AMONG UNTOLD BILLIONS

IMAGINE ALL THE DOTS YOU'VE LOOKED UPON WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THE NIGHT SKY COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE THERE
IT'S AWESOME HOW THEY TIMED THE PHOTO TO CAPTURE THE FLAT SIDE LIKE THAT YOU'D PROBABLY HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING IT AT ALL IF YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE EDGE
ALWAYS HATED SCIENCES HENCE THE REASON I STUDY LAW BUT MAN THIS SUB MAKES ME WANT TO RESEARCH AND WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT SPACE SUBJECTS WHILST DOING MY LEGAL ASSIGNMENTS
WHY IS THE EARTH AND THE MOON THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SEE IN THE SKY WHERE ARE ALL THE STARS AND OTHER PLANETS
MAKES ME REALIZE HOW POINTLESS WE ALL ARE IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE
THIS IS HONESTLY REALLY HUMBLING IT SHOWS THAT IN THE COSMOS WE ARE ONLY A SPECK OF DUST
THERE'S ZERO LIGHT POLLUTION ON MARS WHY ISN'T THE SKY ABSOLUTELY FULL OF STARS
DOES NOT REALLY RAIN DIAMONDS ON NEPTUNE THAT'S JUST AN AN ARTIFACT OF SEARCHING FOR RAIN ON THE NEPTUNE WIKI PAGE DEEP IN A SEA OF METHANE AT HIGH PRESSURE METHANE MAY REDUCE TO DIAMONDS C AND HYDROGEN H BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MOLECULAR SIZED DIAMONDS RAINING DOWN INSIDE A SUPERSONIC LIQUID METHANE AT DEPTH
IT SNOWS A LITTLE BIT EVERY NOW AND THEN ON MARS JUST THE LIGHTEST OF FLURRIES THOUGH
JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS MAKES ME SAD LOOKING OUT INTO SPACE WE CAN SEE THE DESOLATE AND BARREN ROCKY PLANETS THAT FILL OUR SOLAR SYSTEM WE THEN LOOK TO OUR OWN PLANET AND FAIL TO SEE THE BEAUTY AND MAGNIFICENCE OF IT ALL INSTEAD WE GO ABOUT OUR DAILY LIVES WHILE SLOWLY BLEEDING OUR BEAUTIFUL PLANET DRY OF IT'S RESOURCES AND DIVERSITY IN THE NAME OF MONEY AND POWER

THE MOON MUST LOOK UPON US LIKE A LONELY DEPRESSED PARENT LOOKS AT THEIR CHILD WHO IS HEADING DOWN THE WRONG PATH AND WHO KNOWS THAT ONE DAY THEIR CHILD WILL END UP JUST LIKE THEM
HORIZON ON DIFFERENT WORLDSHTTPS PHOTOS

RAINS ON DIFFERENT WORLDS
PHOTOS
ALL THAT EMPTY SPACE ON MARS MAKES ME NOT ENVY THE POOR FOOLS THAT WILL GET SENT OVER THERE
IT'S ALOT HARDER THEN JUST CHAINING SLINGSHOT THAT WOULD TAKE DOUBLE THE TIME DON'T YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON SOMETHING BY NOW SINCE JUNO
WE'VE DONE CHAINED GRAVITY ASSISTS ALREADY WITH THE CASSINI MISSION IT DID 2 AT VENUS AT EARTH AND AT JUPITER FROM WHAT I'M SEEING ITS TOP SPEED WAS SOUTH
S OR S OR S IS NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR THERE TO BE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN CONSEQUENCES AND PROBLEMS
HERE YA GO

I MUST ADMIT I'M STILL EXPECTING TO BE DISAPPOINTED BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE FARTHEST I'VE SEEN ONE OF THESE OSTENSIBLY PROPELLANTLESS PROPULSION SYSTEMS COME
GOD I HOPE THIS THING REALLY WORKS I KNOW IT PROBABLY DOESN'T BUT TO SEE RELATIONLESS DRIVE LOOK THIS PLAUSIBLE MAKES ME THINK MAYBE SOMEDAY I WILL GET TO OWN AND OPERATE MY OWN SPACECRAFT

THE RELATED LINKS AT THE BOTTOM WERE DISAPPOINTING THOUGH THEY ALL HAD A PICTURE OF AN ION THRUSTER REPRESENTING THE EMDRIVE I GUESS ION THRUSTERS LOOK COOLER
WE'RE COMING TO AN AGE WHERE WE MAY NOT BE BORN TOO SOON TO EXPLORE THE UNIVERSE IN FACT WE MAY BE THE FIRST GENERATION TO EXPLORE THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND
FOR EXAMPLE THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT CAN BE SHOWN TO BE A LONG WAVELENGTH CONSEQUENCE OF THE QUANTUM VACUUM RATHER THAN A FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANT WHICH SUGGESTS THAT GRAVITATION ITSELF COULD EMERGE FROM QUANTUM VACUUM PHYSICS

THIS BLEW MY MIND I KNOW IT MAY NOT BE TRUE BUT THE CONCEPT REALLY GOT ME THINKING
VOYAGER IS PROBABLY THE BEST EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IT'S POWER IS SLOWLY DECAYING AND MORE AND MORE INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN TURNED OFFICIAL EVENTUALLY THERE WILL BE ONLY ENOUGH POWER TO RUN THE TRANSMITTER SO IT CAN PING US AND THEN AFTER THAT IT WILL GO DEAD

THERE ARE TWO LIMITATIONS ON THE POWER OUTPUT OF AN RTG BOTH RELATED TO MASSACHUSETTS FIRST THE MOST EFFICIENT SOURCES ARE FROM ISOTOPES THAT DON'T OCCUR NATURALLY THUS THEY HAVE TO BE SYNTHESIZED IN NUCLEAR REACTORS A LONG AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS SECOND WHILE A LARGER MORE MASSIVE RTG WILL PRODUCE MORE POWER IT IS ALSO QUITE A BIT MORE COSTLY TO LAUNCH
ANY ISOTOPE SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD USE IS LIMITED BY ITS HALF-LIFE SO THE POWER OUTPUT DECREASES OVER TIME FURTHERMORE THE THERMOCOUPLE SYSTEM ALSO DEGRADES AT LAUNCH THE THREE RAGS PRODUCED W AS OF OCTOBER THEY PRODUCED W AND WEST

INCREASING POWER OUTPUT REQUIRES MORE FUEL WHICH IS HEAVIER MORE RADIOACTIVE FUEL THAT WON'T LAST AS LONG OR A STERLING CYCLE TURBINE OR OTHER TYPE OF MORE EFFICIENT GENERATOR BUDGET FOR WHICH GOT AXED

THERE IS NO THEORETICAL LIMIT WE COULD LAUNCH A PROBE POWERED BY DECAYING URANIUM WHICH WOULD LAST FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS BUT POWERING THE VOYAGER WOULD TAKE THOUSANDS OF TONS BECAUSE UNSURPRISINGLY ENERGY OUTPUT IS TO ISOTOPE HALF-LIFE SO THERE ARE PRACTICAL LIMITS OF A FEW DECADES WHICH ARE STRETCHED THANKS TO CONTINUOUSLY DISABLING MORE AND MORE SYSTEMS OF THE SPACECRAFT
THESE SPACE PROBES ARE POWERED BY RADIOISOTOPE THERMOELECTRIC GENERATORS THESE HAVE A LUMP OF A RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL IN THEM THAT PRODUCES HEAT AS IT DECAYS THIS HEAT IS TURNED INTO ELECTRICITY BY THERMOCOUPLE

BECAUSE THE FUEL DECAYS THE POWER OUTPUT OF THE RTG DECREASES OVER TIME FOR EXAMPLE THE RAGS ON THE VOYAGER PROBES PRODUCED LESS POWER AFTER YEARS THAN THEY DID WHEN THE PROBES WERE LAUNCHED THE MATERIAL THE THRERMOCOUPLES ARE MADE OF WILL ALSO DEGRADE OVER TIME GRADUALLY REDUCING THEIR ABILITY TO CONVERT THE DECAY HEAT INTO ELECTRICITY

I CAN'T FIND ANY INFO ON RAGS CAPABLE OF BEING REFUELED AS THE FUEL IS SOLID AND THE RTG IS SEALED BASICALLY WELDED SHUT WHEN IT'S BUILT HOWEVER NASA IS WORKING ON DEVELOPING NEW RAGS WHICH USE DIFFERENT MATERIALS FOR THE THERMOCOUPLE THAT WON'T DEGRADE AS FAST LEADING TO THE RTG AS A WHOLE POTENTIALLY HAVING A LONG ENOUGH PRACTICAL LIFESPAN TO BE REUSED FOR MULTIPLE MISSIONS

SOURCE MAINLY THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE ON RAGS
IT SOUNDS LIKE NASA OR OTHERS SHOULD GET BACK TO THE STERLING ENGINE SHOULD THE EM DRIVE PAN OUT WE'LL NEED A LOT MORE POWER THAN RAGS CAN GENERATE
SCIENTISTS EXAMINED PART OF MARS UTOPIA POLANISIA REGION IN THE LATITUDES WITH THE SHALLOW RADAR SARAD INSTRUMENT ANALYSES OF DATA FROM MORE THAN OVERHEAD PASSES REVEALED A DEPOSIT MORE EXTENSIVE IN AREA THAN THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO THE DEPOSIT RANGES IN THICKNESS FROM ABOUT FEET TO ABOUT FEET WITH A COMPOSITION THAT'S TO PERCENT WATER ICE MIXED WITH DUST OR LARGER ROCKY PARTICLES


COULD BE OUR NEW HOME ON MARS BURROW INTO IT GET SHIELDING FROM RADIATION WATER FUEL HYDROGEN OXYGEN AS YOU BURROW YOU GET MORE WATER FUEL HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN BRING A SEALABLE DOOR FROM HOME AND SOMETHING TO MELT THE ICE WITH BACK TO THE ICE CAVES
THE WHITE FLECKS IS THAT RADIATION OR IS IT ICE CRYSTALS REFRACTING THE LIGHT
I DON'T FEEL THAT THIS EVEN REMOTELY QUALIFIES AS THE GREATEST PHOTO EVER TAKEN OFF PLANET THAT IS AN AWFULLY HIGH BAR THAT BEING SAID AND SPEAKING AS A STAR TREK FAN GOING BACK A HALF CENTURY AS WELL AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN USING THE ISS FOR A SCIENCE PROJECT IT IS A COOL PIC OF ESA ASTRONAUT SAMANTHA CRISTOFORETTI ON THE ISS
NOPE WHILE I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PICTURE I WOULD SAY THE PALE BLUE DOT IS BY FAR MUCH MORE MEANINGFUL AND IMPACTFUL

WIKI
DDK WHY BUT THIS IS STILL MY FAVORITE PICTURE TAKEN IN SPACE

WIKIPEDIA COMMONS E
IT'S A NERDY JOKE FROM SAMANTHA THE THING SHE'S POINTING AT IS A DRAGON BRINGING COFFEE FOR THE ISSPRESSO EXPERIMENT



SO THERE WAS COFFEE IN THAT DRAGON



SHE WAS ENACTING THIS CLASSIC QUOTE FROM STAR TREK VOYAGER


SORRY BUT NUMBER

THIS ISN'T EVEN THE GREATEST PHOTO OF A FEMALE ASTRONAUT TAKEN IN THE ISS CUPOLA MUCH LESS THE GREATEST PHOTO EVER TAKEN
CAUSE IT'S EUROPEAN ASTRONAUT IN MODULE POINTING AT A CANADIAN ARM AND A PRIVATE SPACECRAFT ON US MISSION IN SPACE OVER THE OCEAN I DON'T GET WHY IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE THE GREATEST PHOTO

PALE BLUE DOT OR EARTHRISE OR BLUE MARBLE OR TRACY CUPOLA PHOTO OR EVEN A TRIBUTE TO SPOCK ARE A STRONG CANDIDATES TO TAKE IT OVER REALLY THERE'S BEEN SO MANY MORE MEMORABLE AND AMAZING PHOTOS TAKEN THAT I WOULD STRUGGLE TO PICK ONE BUT I DOUBT THIS ONE HERE WOULD MAKE IT TOP THAT'S HOW OUTSTANDING COMPETITION THERE IS
I THOUGHT THE PERSON WAS DRESSED AS A STAR TREK CHARACTER AND THAT WAS WHY IT WAS ON HERE WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS
WE HAVE PHOTOS OF PLUTO IN AMAZING DETAIL AND THIS IS THE GREATEST PHOTO OFF PLANET
WAS I THE ONLY PERSON WHO THOUGHT THAT SHE WASN'T GOING TO MAKE IT VERY MUCH LONGER SHE'S A RED SHIRT
ESA ASTRONAUT SAMANTHA CRISTOFORETTI

THERE ARE SOME AMAZING VIDEOS SHE'S IN ON YOUTUBE

WATCH V NPUVZN
HOLY SHIT GUYS OP IS JUST SAYING IT'S COOL THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST INSERT WHATEVER HERE IS A CATCHY WAY OF SAYING THIS IS REALLY GREAT AND CAUGHT MY ATTENTION IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH THEY'RE NOT SAYING IT'S LITERALLY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PICTURE IN SPACE CALM DOWN GUYS WHY IS EVERYONE SO ON EDGE ABOUT OPINIONS ANYWAYS
AS A CANADIAN THE GREATEST SPACE PERSON PHOTO VIDEO IS CHRIS HADFIELD BUT LET'S NOT FORGET MARC GARNEAU ROBERTA BONDAR JULIE PAYETTE BARANI TRYGGVASON DAVID JEREMY HANSEN ROBERT THIRST STEVE MACLEAN AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE CANADIAN SPACE PROGRAM THAT I HAVE FAILED TO MENTION STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE GREATEST HUMANS
MY FAVORITE PHOTO FIRST UNTETHERED SPACE WALK

BODO R

CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THAT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE THE ISOLATION AND HIGH STAKES REALLY SHOW THROUGH THAT PHOTO
WHY IS THAT WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PHOTO I JUST SEE SOMEONE POINTING OUT A WINDOW AT THE EARTH WITH THEIR THUMB
UNTIL Q SHOWS UP AND MAKES THE EARTH DISAPPEAR JUST FOR SHIT AND GIGGLES
I'M WATCHING VOYAGER RIGHT NOW SO IT ACTUALLY TOOK ME A SECOND TO NOTICE WHY THIS IS AWESOME
IS IT JUST ME OR WAS THIS AN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE TITLE THAT CARRIED ITS CONTENT
WHILE A GREAT PICTURE I PERSONALLY THINK THE GREATEST PICTURE EVER TAKEN IN SPACE IS THIS ONE
MOST OF HUMANITY IN ONE PICTURE
I LOVE HOW ANGRY EVERYONE GOT LIKE SOMEONE JUST SHOT THEIR DOG YOU PEOPLE NEED TO CHILL
ACTUALLY IT IS THE COOLEST PICTURE I'VE EVER SEEN TAKEN FROM SPACE AND THAT IS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN FASCINATED WITH SPACE SINCE I WAS A CHILD BECAUSE OF STAR TREK EVERYONE BELOW WHO'S COMPLAINING ARE ONLY SEEING THE LITTLE PICTURE THE INTEREST IN SOMETHING DETERMINES TO A LARGE EXTENT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IT GETS A PICTURE OF A LUNAR CRATER DOESN'T STIMULATE ANYWHERE NEAR THE PASSION THAT STAR TREK DOES
I LOVE THIS PICTURE SHE IS TALENTED VERY SMART AND WEARS A STARFLEET UNIFORM ON A SPACESTATION
I'LL BE HONEST I THOUGH IT WAS THE GREATEST BECAUSE OF OBVIOUS PHOTOSHOP OPPORTUNITIES
SPACE ASTOUNDS ME THEY TAKE SELFIES FROM DOWNWARD ANGLES LOOKING UP IT'S CRAZY HOW NO GRAVITY DOES THAT
I'D GIVE HER 2 BARS GOLD PRESSED LATIUM IF SHE WOULD BE WILLING TO BE A SPINNER
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SKIN TIGHT UNITARDS

PRETTY SURE ROI WAS THE REASON I STARTED PUBERTY AT LIKE
I REALLY DISLIKE HOW THIS SUB HAS BEEN SLIDING TOWARD MEDIOCRITY WITH ITS CONTENT AND TITLES LATELY
CRISTOFORETTI IF THAT IS INDEED HER REAL NAME IS ABOUT TO GET A VISIT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TEMPORAL INVESTIGATIONS

FOAH I WISH I COULD GO THERE TO GET A PHOTO OF MYSELF AS WELL IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE TOO
NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY CLOSE BUT YEAH IT'S A PRETTY COOL PIC NON THE LESS THOUGH IT MAY FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF JUST ANOTHER IMAGE TAKEN ON THE SPACE STATION

THIS IS LIKELY THE MOST UNINTERESTING PHOTO FROM SPACE I'VE EVER SEEN I DON'T EVEN GET IT WHATS SO SPECIAL ABOUT A CHICK IN HER PAJAMAS POINTING OUT THE WINDOW






WELL I'M CONFUSED BECAUSE THE WOMAN WHO WAS ON THERE BEFORE HER HAIR WAS STICKING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE HER HAIR IS LOVELY AND SORTED I DOUBT THAT'S IN SPACE
MY UNCLE DESIGNED THE MODULE SHE IS IN IT'S CALLED THE CUPOLA MODULE AND IS THE BIGGEST WINDOW OBSERVATORY ON THE STATION
I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT HOW MANY MILLIONS THOUSANDS IT MUST HAVE COST NASA OR THE ESA JUST TO BRING THAT COSTUME TO SPACE I MEAN HOW MUCH DO CLOTHES WEIGH LBS SO IT MIGHT HAVE COST THEM JUST TO BRING THAT COSTUME THERE JUST SO THEY CAN ENACT A STAR TREK JOKE
YES MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE HIGH DEF IMAGES FROM PLUTO OR FROM THE SURFACE OF MARS OR OF JUPITER BECAUSE OF THE STAR TREK UNIFORM
IS SHE TRYING TO BRING DOWN THE THE STATION SHE BETTER BE A RESPONSIBLE RED SHIRT AND GET KILLED ALONE IN THE VACUUM OR SOMETHING
BRINGING IN ANOTHER SCIFI SERIES ANALOGY BABYLON I CAN SEE THIS AS A WHAT WAS WHAT IS WHAT WILL BE THE ISS IS THE PAST DRAGON IS THE PRESENT AND THE STAR TREK REFERENCE IS A FUTURE GOAL
LOVE THAT OF ALL THE THINGS AN ASTRONAUT WANTS FOR LIVING IN SPACE THIS MADE THE LIST STILL NOT THE GREATEST PHOTO OFF PLANET THOUGH
WHY BECAUSE IT HAS A WOMAN IN IT


YOU'RE FUCKING PATHETIC U ANOTHERSMEGHEAD
UNLESS THE PHOTO WAS TAKEN BY AN ALIEN LINEIFORM AND SHE IS GIVING IT DIRECTIONS TO EARTH IT'S NOT THE GREATEST PHOTO EVER TAKEN
I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT'S TRUE THIS IS A WONDERFUL STORY
DON T BELIEVE A SINGLE WORD THESE PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU

THAT LIAR'S PARADOX THOUGH
DELETED
NICE PHOTO OP DO YOU WANT TO KNOW A SUPER EASY WAY TO DEAL WITH ATMOSPHERIC DISTORTION
ASTRONAUTS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON HAVE SAID THAT THE ENTIRE SKY IS FILLED WITH STARS
IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHERE YOU WERE AND WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT BUT IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN SOMEWHERE RURAL ON A CLEAR NIGHT WITH A DARK SKIES BY-LAW IT WOULD LOOK A LOT LIKE THAT BUT NO STAR TWINKLING DUE TO ATMOSPHERE
WOULD IT LOOK LIKE THE AMOUNT OF STARS YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WILDERNESS

IT WOULD LOOK SIMILAR BUT YOU'D BE ABLE TO SEE EVEN MORE STARS AND THEY WOULDN'T TWINKLE
ATMOSPHERIC EXTINCTION WOULD NOT EXIST SO YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE STARS OF THE SAME BRIGHTNESS IN EVERY DIRECTION AND ALSO YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE DOWN TO ANOTHER MAGNITUDE COMPARED TO EVEN THE DARKEST SKIES ON EARTH IS THE LIMIT FOR EXPERT OBSERVERS ON EARTH UNDER PERFECT SKIES THE LIMIT IN SPACE COULD BE PLANETS WOULD NOT LOOK ANY DIFFERENT
THEY'VE GOTTA BE SENDING UP DUCT TAPE PAPERCLIP RUBBERBANDS AND A BUNCH OF OTHER JUNK DRAWER STUFF JUST TO HAVE ON HAND FOR UNPLANNED SITUATIONS RIGHT
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE PICTURE TO ME SLOWLY AS IF YOU HAD ALREADY TRIED TO DO SO TEN TIMES BEFORE

EDIT THANKS FOR TEACHING ME ABOUT A COOL EPISODE IN SPACE ENGINEERING
I HAVE ACTUALLY MET A MAN WHO HELPED COME UP WITH THAT SOLUTION THE AIR PURIFICATION SYSTEM ON THE THE SHIP INVOLVED CHEMICAL CRYSTALS THAT WOULD SCRUB THE AIR AS IT PASSED THROUGH AND THIS MAN WORKED FOR THE COMPANY WHO PROVIDED THOSE CRYSTALS NASA REACHED OUT TO THEM TO SEE IF THEY COULD OFFER ANY GUIDANCE AND THIS GUY CAME UP WITH THE SOLUTION HE HAS A TROPHY AWARD TYPE THING FROM NASA TO SHOW FOR IT I CAN'T REMEMBER HIS NAME UNFORTUNATELY BUT HE RETIRED TO A TOWN OUTSIDE OF CHARLOTTE NC AND I MET HIM A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHILE WORKING IN A PREVIOUS JOB AND WE STRUCK UP A CONVERSATION AND SOMEHOW LANDED ON THAT TOPIC
IS THERE A SCHEMATIC ANYWHERE OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY BUILT AND HOW IT FIT
WE'VE GOTTA FIND A WAY TO FIT THIS INTO THE HOLE FOR THIS USING NOTHING BUT THAT
THIS IS A GREAT SHOT WHAT CAME TO MY EYE UNEXPECTEDLY WAS THE STACKS OF PAPER BINDED TOGETHER IN THE BACKGROUND I WONDER HOW MUCH WAS WEIGHT WAS USED IN PAPER LOGS PROCEDURES
AND THAT'S HOW THE CUBICLE OFFICE PHRASE CAME ABOUT

BOB YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SYNERGY WE NEED YOU TO FIT THE SQUARE PEG IN THE ROUND HOLE MORE
AN INTELLIGENT OVERVIEW OF THE CLAIMS ACTUAL EVIDENCE CRITICAL OBJECTIONS AND POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS I'VE READ A FEW OF THESE AND FOR ONCE THE MEDIA HAVE DONE A NICE JOB
IT'S A GOOD ARTICLE ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION IS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO CONFORM TO THIRD LAW WITHOUT REALIZING IT

ONE EXAMPLE IS HYPOTHETICAL FIELD PROPULSION DRIVES THESE ARE DRIVES WHICH PUSH AGAINST QUANTUM FIELDS FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN PUSH PULL AGAINST A PLANET'S MAGNETIC FIELD USING A STRONG ELECTROMAGNET THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE WOULD BE AN ELECTRODYNAMIC TETHER OF WHICH WORKING DEVICES HAVE INDEED BEEN BUILT FIELD PROPULSION OF MORE EXOTIC VARIETIES MIGHT INTERACT WITH OTHER QUANTUM FIELDS SUCH AS THE HIGGS FIELD BUT WHO KNOWS IF THAT'S ACTUALLY POSSIBLE UNLESS YOU KNEW TO LOOK FOR DISTORTIONS IN THESE QUANTUM FIELDS AND HAD THE MEANS TO DO SO YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IF YOUR DEVICE WAS ACTUALLY INTERACTING WITH THEM OR NOT

BY THE WAY I JUST PROPELLED MY ROLLING OFFICE CHAIR ACROSS THE ROOM BY REPEATEDLY JERKING FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS WITHOUT EXPELLING PROPELLANT DID I JUST VIOLATE THIRD LAW OF COURSE NOT THE POINT IS THIRD LAW IS MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE THAN MOST PEOPLE THINK YOU JUST NEED TO PUSH AGAINST SOMETHING IN SPACE THAT HAS TRADITIONALLY REQUIRED YOU SPIT SOMETHING OUT YOUR BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING OBVIOUS TO PUSH AGAINST BUT SINCE THE UNIVERSE IS FILLED WITH QUANTUM FIELDS AND THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECT VACUUM THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT
MY GOD THIS TITLE

THEY ARE NOT CLAIMING IT WORKS THEY ARE CLAIMING THE METHODOLOGY USED TO TEST THE ENGINE APPEARS TO BE FLAWLESS
IT DOESN'T NOT WORK BUT IT DOESN'T WORK IS WHAT I GOT FROM THIS

EXCITING
IT'S AMAZING HOW WELL-SHOT PHOTOS FROM BACK IN THE DAY STILL LOOK NEW
THE PHOTO IS GREAT BUT LOOK AT THIS SPACE SHIP ON A LAUNCHPAD FROM FUCKING ON ITS WAY TO THE MOON
THAT'S A GREAT PHOTO AND SHOWS MANY COOL DETAILS OF THE VEHICLE WHICH ARE SMALL BUT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ITS OPERATION

THE PRESSURIZATION DUCT ON THE WHICH FED GASEOUS OXYGEN TO THE TOP OF THE STAGE DURING FLIGHT TO PRESSURIZE THE LOX TANK

THE ULLAGE MOTORS ON THE INTERSTAGE

THE DUCTS THAT ROUTED THE HYDROGEN FUEL FOR AROUND THE LOX TANK AT ITS BOTTOM

THE AUXILIARY PROPULSION SYSTEM PACKAGES STUCK WAY UP ON THE SIDES OF

EDIT ACTUALLY AS IT TURNED OUT ULLAGE WASN'T THAT CRITICAL THE J MISSION APOLLOS FLEW WITHOUT THOSE MOTORS

THE VIEW FROM ABOVE HETP OF THE SAME ROLLOUT
THE SATURN WAS ALWAYS MY FAVORITE ROCKET I GREW UP WITH THAT BIRD

THE NEW STUFF IS COOL VERY COOL BUT THE SATURN IT'S JUST SPECIAL
STILL WAS AVOIDING ALL THE FLIP-FLOPPING AT THE LAUNCH PAD WORTH THE FUSS OF TRANSPORTING THIS MONSTER VERTICALLY
WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MATH PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY GO INTO BUILDING SOMETHING LIKE THAT MY HEAD NEARLY IMPLODES
CAN SOMEONE SAY A COOLER WORD FOR I AM GONNA WALLPAPER THIS FOR MY PHONE
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT YOU GUYS WANT ME TO STRAP THAT THING ON MY BACK AND LAUNCH ME WHERE
I GET A WEIRD SENSE OF VERTIGO FROM LOOKING UP AT TALL NEAR BY OBJECTS THIS PICTURE DID IT FOR ME
REMINDS ME OF THE AZTEC LEVEL FROM GOLDENEYE
WHATS THAT BACKPACK LOOKING THING ON THE ROCKET 3RD ARM FROM THE TOP

EDIT AUXILIARY PROPULSION SYSTEM IS THIS FOR SEPARATION OF THE STAGES
AWESOME I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW THEY ASSEMBLED THESE LAST NIGHT
INSPIRATIONAL LIKE THE SPIRE OF A CATHEDRAL THE HUMAN SPIRIT REACHING FOR THE STARS
TAKEN BY A SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE THE PHONE WAS THEN PUT INSIDE THE ROCKET FOR EXTRA PROPULSION
THIS LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE A 3D RENDER TO ME I'M EVEN LESS CONVINCED OF ITS AUTHENTICITY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF NOISE IN THE SHADOWS AND THE FLARES AND LACK OF SHADOW INSIDE THE SHED LOOK ODD LIKE NOTHING IS OUT OF FOCUS EVEN THE FURTHEST PARTS OF THE IMAGE IT JUST DOESN'T MATCH THE CAMERA TECHNOLOGY OF THE SOUTH

EITHER THAT OR IT HAS BEEN RETOUCHED UP THE WAHOO MORE RECENTLY
LOOKED AT POLARIS AT LAST NIGHT STILL DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON FOR ME AT DEGREES LATITUDE IF THE EARTH WAS TITLING OFF ITS DEGREE TILT POLARIS WOULDN'T BE AT THE POLE IT WOULD DEGREES AWAY AND CIRCLING THE POLE THIS WOULD BE BLATANTLY NOTICEABLE BY ALL ASTRONOMERS AMATEUR AND PROFESSIONAL SINCE TO TAKE PHOTOS WE ALIGN TELESCOPES BASED ON THAT TILT WE WOULD ALL BE SCREAMING OUR HEADS OFF IF THIS WAS HAPPENING

THE TILT OF THE EARTH CHANGES OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS NOT 2 BIBIRU IS BUNK
THE VIDEO INCLUDES SUCH UNSCIENTIFIC WORDS AS EXTREME ALARMING AND BIBIRU THIS DOES NOT NEED OUR HELP IN DEBUNKING
ORIGINAL STORY HETP
A CUTE PUN ACUTE CASE OF PAREIDOLIA
THE VON KARMAN LECTURES IN GENERAL ARE SOME OF THE BEST VIDEOS YOU CAN WATCH IF YOU WANT TO DIVE INTO THE DETAILS OF HOW SPACE MISSIONS WORK AND GET DETAILED INFO ON THE SCIENCE THE CASSINI MISSION VIDEOS ARE PARTICULARLY GOOD
UNTIL SPACE TRAVEL REACHES THE POINT WHERE TRAVELING TO MARS IS AS EASY AS TRAVELING TO THE NEAREST POLICE STATION NUMBER THE VAST DISTANCES INHERENT IN INTERPLANETARY COLONIES NECESSITATES THE NEED FOR THERE COULD BE CONNECTIONS YES THE FIRST SAY AMERICAN MARS COLONY MIGHT DRAFT A CONSTITUTION BASED ON AMERICAN LAW WITH ENUMERATED RIGHTS BUILT INTO IT AND LIKELY UPDATED TO REFLECT CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY AND THERE WOULD LIKELY BE AN UNWRITTEN ASSUMPTION THAT THE COLONY WOULD REPORT TO AND FOLLOW ALL REASONABLE ORDERS FROM THEIR SUPERIORS THE FLIGHT DIRECTORS AND MISSION CONTROLLERS FROM NASA BUT ONCE THE COLONY BECOMES SELF-SUSTAINING THEY SWITCH FROM BEING A LONG-TERM SCIENTIFIC MISSION TO A TRULY INDEPENDENT COLONY AND THEY WOULD THEN HAVE THE RIGHT AND ABILITY TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE CHAIN IF THEY SO DESIRED
DOUBT THAT REMEMBER WHEN THE THIRTEEN COLONIES WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BRITISH ONCE THE POPULATION REACHED A CERTAIN THRESHOLD THE DESIRE FOR INDEPENDENCE AND SELF RULE WILL ALWAYS INCREASE
I DOUBT A UNIFIED SINGLE PLANET GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK IMAGINE TRYING TO KEEP EVERY FUCKING VILLAGE IN NEPAL OR NIGERIA IN LINE WITH WORLD GOVERNMENT POLICIES
THE KEY TO LONG TERM SUCCESS OF ANY GOVERNMENT IS TO ESTABLISH A COMMON SET OF BASIC PRINCIPLES INCLUDING SELF-DETERMINATION AND RESTRAIN THE HIGHER LEVEL FROM MICROMANAGING ALL DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE AS LOCALLY AS POSSIBLE AND DECISIONS INVOLVING MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS CAN OFTEN BE MADE JUST BETWEEN THOSE JURISDICTIONS AND ONLY ADOPTED SYSTEMWIDE WHEN IT'S OBVIOUSLY BENEFICIAL AND ACCEPTED BY EVERYONE ALREADY IOW THE LEAST GLOBAL GOVERNANCE HAS THE BEST PROSPECT OF LONG TERM SUCCESS
MARS EATS SPACESHIPS IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE MORE NATIONS INVESTING IN DISCOVERING TECHNIQUES TO SLAKE ITS APPETITE UAE HAS SOME DEEP POCKETS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THAT SHAPES THEIR EFFORTS

U HOODED 2 YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF THIS IS THE KIND OF BUNK SCIENCE THAT GETS REPEATED SO MUCH THAT IGNORANT PEOPLE BELIEVE IT YOU'RE IGNORANT YOURSELF AT THE VERY LEAST FOR NOT DOING A MODICUM OF VERIFICATION OF THIS NONSENSE

THAT'S AN AEROSPIKE ENGINE NOZZLE I'M STILL WAITING FOR ONE OF THOSE TO FLY TO ORBIT LOOKING AT YOU FIREFLY ALPHA

OK I'LL BE THAT GUY HOW WAS THIS TAKEN DO THEY JUST EDIT OUT THE CAMERA ARM
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THE SKY YOU CAN SEE WHAT LOOK LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE BACKGROUND IS THIS SOME SORT OF ARTIFACT CAUSED BY THE CAMERA OR WERE THERE ACTUALLY RAINBOWS PRESENT HERE
IT SERIOUSLY NEVER FAILS TO BLOW MY MIND THAT THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN ON ANOTHER FUCKING PLANET
ORIGINAL HIRES IMAGE HERE
IMAS

CHECK OUT THE DUSTINESS AND WEAR AND TEAR ON THE ROOF ARE THOSE DARK BROWN PATCHES PLACES WHERE DUST HAS COAGULATED OR WHERE THE WHITE PAINT HAS PEELED OFF

I DID THE SAME THING WITH THIS IMAGE HETP
FUNNY THING IS FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW THAT PHOTO IS MORE ACCURATE IN THAT ORIENTATION
I MADE THE IMAGE MORE VIVID FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE ME ENJOY SATURATED COLORS


THE ARTICLE GIVES CREDIT TO A MAN IN ENGLAND YET THE YOUTUBE VIDEO LINKED IS FROM AND WAS UPLOADED BY AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER IN BRAZIL
I LOVE THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING STRAIGHT OUT OF R WRITINGPROMPTS
THAT SHOT AT IS PRETTY NEAT
WRITTEN WELL BEFORE THE SPACE GUADALAJARA ANNOUNCEMENT IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE ABOUT WHAT'S MINIMALLY POSSIBLE WITH GRASPABLE TECHNOLOGY

I'D BE INTERESTED IN READING SOMETHING MORE RECENT BY THIS AUTHOR ON THE SUBJECT TO SEE IF THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTENCE OF THE ITS ACT OR IF THEY STICK TO THE ORION VISION AS THE ONLY POSSIBILITY
IM CONFIDENT IT WILL HAVE TO BE SOLAR SUPPLEMENTED WITH NUCLEAR EACH ACTING AS A FAIL SAFE FOR THE OTHER AND NUCLEAR TAKING THE LARGER LOAD
THE QUESTION ITSELF ISN'T ANSWERABLE YO BRO YOU ARE LOOKING AT TIME SPACE AS DIFFERENT THINGS

WHAT EXISTED THERE BEFORE DOESN'T MATTER AS THERE WAS NO BEFORE OR THERE FOR THAT MATTER

WHAT'S TO SAY THE VOLUME HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME AND THE CONTENTS AREN'T MERELY UNIFORMLY DECREASING IN SIZE
I THINK THIS IS A FALLACY OF HUMAN PERCEPTION AND THE NEED TO QUANTIFY EVERYTHING AS SOMETHING EVEN IF THAT SOMETHING IS NOTHING THIS CREATES A PARADOX THAT OUR BRAINS SIMPLY CANNOT HANDLE YOU ASSUME THAT THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING INTO SOMEWHERE ELSE BUT THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE FACT THAT THE SOMEWHERE ELSE DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED INTO IT I KNOW IT MAKES MY BRAIN HURT TOO THE FACT IS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE NOW WE SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE TO THE CONTRARY ITS NOTHING MORE THAN PURE SPECULATION TO ASSUME ANYTHING ELSE
IT'S NOT EXPANDING INTO ANYTHING SPACE BETWEEN DISTANT GALAXIES IS EXPANDING THE USUAL EXAMPLE GIVEN IS TO THINK OF A DEFLATED BALLOON USING A MARKER YOU DRAW TWO DOTS ONE INCH A PART THEN YOU BLOW UP THE BALLOON THE DOTS WILL NO LONGER BE 2 INCHES APART
INFINITY DOESN'T RUN OUT

IF YOU HAVE INFINITE SPACE AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN EVERY OBJECT INCREASES THE SIZE IS STILL INFINITY

ALSO WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THE BIG BANG DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THE UNIVERSE EXPANDED FROM A SINGLE POINT MORE LIKE ALL INFINITE POINTS EXPANDED FROM OTHER INFINITE POINTS WHICH WERE INITIALLY CLOSER TOGETHER
SPACE SHOULD RATHER BE VIEWED AS A BYPRODUCT OF ENERGY AND MATTER IT IS THE RESULT OF SUCCESSIVE EXPANSION DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE WHERE EXPANSION HAS YET TO REACH IS A DEVOID OF ANY KNOWN MATTER OR ENERGY THE ANSWER IS NOTHING AND THIS IS A FAILURE OF YOUR HUMAN MIND TO FULLY COMPREHEND YOU HAVE YET TO DEFINE ANY PERIMETERS ONCE THE VALUES BECOME DESCRIBED ONLY THEN CAN WE BEGIN TO EXAMINE IT'S PROPERTIES IT'S SORT OF LIKE ASKING THE QUESTION WHERE DO THE PHOTONS COME FROM WHEN I TURN ON A LIGHT AS IF TO IMPLY ALL THE LIGHT PARTICLES ARE CONTAINED WITHIN A BULB JUST WAITING TO BE RELEASED
THE WAY I SEE IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE THERE IS NOTHING THE UNIVERSE IS WHAT IS AS IT EXPANDS BEING ITSELF EXPANDS I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY SPACE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EMPTY SPACE FOR THE UNIVERSE TO EXPAND INTO
NOTHING SPACE HAS PROPERTIES SUCH AS TRANSMISSIBILITY OF RADIATION MATTER CAN OCCUPY IT ETC OUTSIDE OF THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE IS LITERALLY NOTHING AND IT LACKS ANY PROPERTY THAT SPACE HAS
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WHAT THERE WAS BEFORE THE BIG BANG BUT THIS

IF THE ACTIONS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE FROM ONE GIANT EXPLOSION THE BIG BANG AND IS EVER EXPANDING IN EVERY DIRECTION DUE TO THE SHEER FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION

IS NOT CORRECT THE BIG BANG WAS NOT AN EXPLOSION AND SPACE ISN'T EXPANDING BECAUSE OF AN EXPLOSION I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A BAD CHOICE OF WORDS FROM YOUR PART OR IF YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE BIG BANG WAS AN EXPLOSION WITH MATERIAL OR SPACE BEING FLUNG OUT IN EVERY DIRECTION BUT I JUST THOUGHT I'D MENTION IT
I DON'T THINK THE UNIVERSE IN EXPANDING BECAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION I THINK THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING AS A RESULT OF TAKING ON MASS AND ENERGY FROM OUTSIDE OUR UNIVERSE BUT I SUBSCRIBE TO THE THEORY THAT OUR UNIVERSE IS INSIDE A BLACK HOLE INSIDE ANOTHER UNIVERSE
THEORIES OKAY

DARK ENERGY IT'S EXPANDING INTO SEA OF DARK ENERGY THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THE FABRIC OF THE MULTIVERSE
INFINITE SPACE
ALSO THESE ARE UNEDITED SINCE I'VE NOT GOTTEN THE HANG OF THAT JUST YET
ARE YOU THINKING OF GOING ON A RAINY DAY BECAUSE THERE IS A CHANCE OF LESS PEOPLE OR IS THERE ANOTHER REASON
THE BUS TOUR IS NEAT THEY TAKE YOU OUT TO SEE SOME PLACES WHERE HISTORY HAPPENED FIRST TIME I WENT IT WAS RAINY AND WE COULDN'T SEE THE LAUNCH PADS

THERE'S ALSO A COOL ROCKET GARDEN OUTSIDE
I ALWAYS THOUGHT ONE FULL DAY WOULD KEEP YOU PLENTY BUSY THERE THERE'S A GOOD AMOUNT OF WALKING OUTSIDE IN BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND WHATNOT

WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE WOULD A METER ASTEROID DO IF IT WERE TO HIT EARTH

THIS KEEPS GETTING POSTED OVER AND OVER AND EACH TIME THE TITLE GETS LONGER AND CRAPPIER

SURE BLAME IT ON TRUMP LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE YOU SURE MUST BE A SORRY ASS LOSER
YOU KNOW YOUR VEHICLE IS BADASS WHEN EACH ENGINE HAS A HORSEPOWER FUEL PUMP
LOOKS LIKE THE FLAME IS CREEPING UP THE BOTTOM OF THE ROCKET ANYONE KNOW WHY

ARE THEY STILL SHOCK DIAMONDS WHEN THEY'RE LARGER THAN THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE
HOOOOOLY SHIT IT'S HARD TO COMPREHEND THE SHEER SCALE OF THOSE ROCKETS THE FULL EXHAUST PLUME MUST BE LIKE WHAT A HALF MILE LONG
LOOKING AT THIS PICK IT'S HARD TO COMPREHEND JUST HOW BIG THIS THING REALLY IS

A FEW MONTHS BACK I WAS AT JSC STOOD RIGHT NEXT TO A SATURN VERB

GOOGLE DIDN'T FIND ME A DEFINITION BUT IT DID FIND A BOOK WITH THE WORD IN THE TITLE WHAT IS UNDEREXPANED
HAVING STOOD NEXT TO A SATURN V AND SEEN HOW MASSIVE IT IS THE SIGHT OF THAT EXHAUST IS INTIMIDATING I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE HUMAN BEINGS BUILT THAT THING THEN CLIMBED IN AND FLEW IT TO THE MOON AND BACK IN THE S
WAS ALL THAT POWER REALLY NEEDED TO GET US TO THE MOON OR WAS IT OVER KILL WHY ARE ROCKETS NOWADAYS SMALLER THAN THE SATURN V
SO THE PLUME CAN EXPAND OUT AND UP IN LOWER AMBIENT PRESSURE BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ROCKET WERE STATIONARY AS IF HELD IN PLACE FOR TESTING HOW FAR COULD THE PLUME CREEP IF IT WEREN'T TRYING TO OUTRUN ITS EXHAUST

HERE'S VIDEO OF THE SAME EVENT IN THE PICTURE APOLLO BLASTING ITS WAY OFF INTO SPACE TO THE MOON
WHEN YOU REALISE THAT THE ROCKET AT THE TOP IS TALLER THAN A STOREY BUILDING
MAKES ME THINK WE COULD GET A LOT BETTER THRUST IF WE COULD FIND SOMETHING THAT WOULD COMPLETE IT'S BURNING EXPANSION BEFORE IT LEFT THE ROCKET OF COURSE THE MIGHT EITHER END UP BEING A FUEL WITH VERY LITTLE EXPANSION OR WITH TOO MUCH EXPANSION FOR THE ENGINE TO CONTAIN
THOSE LOOK LIKE VERNIER THRUSTERS ON THE SIDES ARE YOU SURE IT'S ALL
GOVERNMENT LIES SCIENTOLOGY IS THE MOON A FUCKING TURTLE WHO THE FUCK KNOWS MAN
IN YEARS WE ARE BETTER OFF SENDING HUMANS TO ANOTHER STAR WITH MORE HABITABLE PLANETS AROUND IT
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF THE IDEA OF BOMBARDING THE POLES WITH ASTEROID AND COMET REDIRECT MISSIONS WARM THE PLANET WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASING THE MASS OF VALUABLE CHEMICALS SUCH AS WATER

THE REAL TRUTH IS THAT IF WE WANT TO TERRACIFORM AN ENTIRE PLANET IT'S GOING TO TAKE A MULTIFACETED APPROACH
YES WE CAN DO ALL OF THAT STUFF WE JUST NEED ABOUT TRILLION TO PAY FOR IT ALL

UNTIL SOMEBODY COMES UP WITH A PLAN FOR FUNDING IT'S FICTION
THE DIAGRAM AT THE FRONT OF THE ARTICLE AND IN THE THUMBNAIL IS CONFUSING THE SCALE DOESN'T MATCH THE COLORS ON THE GLOBE NO WHITE OR BROWN IN THE SCALE AND THE GLOBE IS JUST THE MOLA TERRAIN ALTITUDE MAP

I'M ABOUT SURE THAT IMAGE IS NONSENSE
SO IS THIS SAYING CERTAIN PARTS OF A THE SURFACE ARE MORE TOLERABLE THAN OTHERS TO HUMANS
DESPITE BEING AS THICK AS THE ATMOSPHERE THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE ACTUALLY DOES A LOT TO PROTECT THE SURFACE

BUT ANYONE SAYING THAT IT PRESENTS A BIG PROBLEM IS JUST FLAT OUT WRONG RADIATION DOESN'T PRESENT A BIG PROBLEM TO THE ASTRONAUTS GOING TO THE ISS WHERE THE RADIATION LEVELS ARE GREATER THAN THE MARTIAN SURFACE IT SIMPLY LIMITS HOW OFTEN YOU CAN GO A COUPLE YEARS ON THE ISS OR MARS MISSIONS BEFORE SIGNIFICANT RISK ACCUMULATES

AN EXTRA OR 2 CHANCE OF GETTING CANCER LATER IN LIFE ISN'T AN INSURMOUNTABLE RISK SIMPLY A CONSIDERATION THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF AIRLINE PILOTS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO HIGHER RADIATION LEVELS AND SOME OF THEM PROBABLY DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT

AND THIS IS EVEN BEFORE ANY ATTEMPT TO BLOCK THE RADIATION LIKE BUILDING UNDERGROUND AND HAVING A COUPLE FEET OF DIRT AS PROTECTION
THIS LOOKS LIKE SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE FROM A HORROR MOVIE THAT SUDDENLY FLICKS UP WITH THE KILLERS FACE THEN CUTS BACK TO NOTHING
THE DAILY MAIL HAD A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT EXPLANATION
WHAT IS FUNNY IS THAT NOT A BUT A WEEK AGO ZUCKERBERG MADE A POST FOCUSING ON NOT SPREADING FALSE ARTICLES AND HOW HE WANTS FACEBOOK TO BE A PLACE WHERE WE CAN FIND TRUTH IN THE NEWS GOING WELL SO FAR I SEE

SEND MORE ROVERS TO MARS REPLACE THE HUBBLE AND BUILD MORE RADIO SCOPES
WELL IF THEY WANT TO PLAY THE LONG GAME AND JUST HOLD ON TO MOST OF IT THEY COULD TRIPLE THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET FOR THE NEXT SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE NEXT YEARS NOT ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENT EARNED INTEREST OR INFLATION IN THE TOTAL US MILITARY BUDGET WAS BILLION DOLLARS WHILE NASA SPENT AROUND BILLION DOLLARS OR ABOUT TH THAT OF THE MILITARY BUT EVEN AS A PROPONENT OF PEACE AND OF NASA I'D HATE TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE MILITARY WITH BUDGET

EDIT THANKS U FOR THE CORRECTION WIKIPEDIA HAS IT BROKEN OUT INTO DEFENSE AND TOTAL BUDGET ON A PAGE NAMED MILITARY BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES WHICH I NAIVELY ASSUMED TOTAL TO MEAN TOTAL MILITARY INCLUDING DDK OFFENSE RATHER THAN WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS WHICH IS TOTAL NATIONAL BUDGET FIXED
THE UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS CAUSED BY THE LAYOFF OF SO MANY MILITARY WOULD SEND AMERICA INTO A DEEP RECESSION
FOR ONE YEAR NOTHING THE CLERICAL ERROR WOULD BE FIXED BEFORE ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT WOULD BE BUILT

WORRY NOT IN THE COMING DECADES WE'RE BOUND TO SEE USAF AND CIA DABBLE IN MANNED SPACEFLIGHT AGAIN
ADVERTISING AND LOBBYING
TV BOOKS FILMS NEWSPAPERS EVERY INTERNET PAGE FOR A DAY
ADVERTISE WHAT COULD BE POSSIBLE IF NASA WAS PROPERLY FUNDED CONVINCE THE POPULATION AND CONGRESS THAT NASA IS WORTH SPENDING MORE ON
THEN SECURE LONG TERM BUDGET INCREASES FOR YEARS TO COME
SIGH THIS AGAIN BUT YOU DO EARN A GOLD STAR FOR THE CREATIVE CLERICAL ERROR IT GAVE ME A CHUCKLE HTTPS

NOTHING MUCH A YEAR'S WORTH OF PROPER FUNDING WOULDN'T REALLY FINISH ANY MISSIONS FASTER OR ADVANCE SCIENCE MUCH FURTHER ORGANIZATIONS ON THE SCALE OF NASA HAVE INCREDIBLE INERTIA AND NEED TO BE STEERED ALONG FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEAR TIMESCALE A YEAR SIMPLY ISN'T LONG ENOUGH NO MATTER HOW BIG THE BUDGET INCREASE

SUCH A LARGE INCREASE FOR SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME MIGHT BE USED TO BUY EXPENSIVE NEW EQUIPMENT OR DESIRED REAL ESTATE BUT REMEMBER THAT IN THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY THE SALARIES OF THE ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS NEEDED TO STAFF YOUR NEWLY BOUGHT TOYS AND OFFICES
I'D BANK THE MONEY HOPEFULLY THE INTEREST WOULD PAY FOR NASA FULL TIME
WE WOULD GET A REALLY LENGTHY REPORT ON HOW WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND PLANS TO GO TO MARS IN TWENTY YEARS
IN JUST ONE YEAR NOT MUCH I THINK THEY'D PROBABLY BEGIN CONSTRUCTION OF A TON OF NEW PROBES AND MAYBE TRY TO EXPAND THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION HONESTLY THOUGH YOU'D PROBABLY BE DISAPPOINTED THE REALLY GOOD STUFF TAKES MORE TIME THAN A YEAR TO PLAN AND EXECUTE
BUY NUCLEAR MISSELS FROM THE MILITARY AND GO FULL THROTTLE ON PROJECT ORION
NOT MUCH CONSIDERING VIRTUALLY ANY SPACE PROJECT WORTH DOING WITH THAT KIND OF BUDGET WOULD TAKE YEARS TO DESIGN BUILD LAUNCH AND PERFORM ITS MISSION
THE DEPRESSING ANSWER IS VERY LITTLE IT TAKES FAR LONGER THAN A YEAR TO DO GRAND PROGRAMS ESP IN GOVERNMENT I'M NOT EVEN SURE YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO HIRE ALL THE PERSONNEL YOU WOULD NEED BEFORE THE YEAR WAS UP
INSTANT FUNDING FOR A HUGE NUMBER OF MISSIONS AND CRAFT THE SLS AND AWST WOULD ACTUALLY DEFINITELY BE DONE BY IF IT STAYED LIKE THAT FOR SOME YEARS THERE MAY WELL BE A NEW REUSABLE CRAFT READY FOR EXCHANGES MISSIONS TO EUROPA GANYMEDE TITAN ETC THOUGH I WOULDN'T SAY ROVERS OR SUBMARINES IS ANYTHING NEAR A CERTAINTY DEDICATED LONG-TERM MISSIONS TO MERCURY AND AT THE VERY LEAST FLYBYS OF URANUS AND NEPTUNE A LA NEW HORIZONS MISSIONS TO THE ASTEROID BELT AND MORE CHIEFLY THE KUIPER BELT MAY TIE INTO THE URANUS NEPTUNE MISSIONS NEW SATELLITES TO LOOK FOR EXOPLANETS AND GENERALLY LOOK FOR THINGS OUT THERE IN THE UNIVERSE AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR MANNED MARS EXPLORATION AND PLANNING FOR HABITATION

LESS ATMOSPHERE BUT ALSO LESS GRAVITY NAPKIN MATH SAYS YOU'D NEED MORE LIFT SURFACE LARGER BLADES
MARS HELICOPTER COURTESY JPL
MARS CERTAINLY HAS AN ATMOSPHERE AND I'VE SEEN SOME PROPOSALS FOR AIRCRAFT TO EXPLORE MARS I THINK MOST OF THEM WERE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT THOUGH

THE OTHER BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MARS AIRCRAFT AND EARTH AIRCRAFT IS THERE IS NO OXYGEN FOR A COMBUSTION ENGINE SO IT WOULD HAVE TO BE BATTERY POWERED AND CURRENTLY BATTERY TECHNOLOGY IS NOT VERY GREAT THERE'S A LOT TO CONSIDER THERE
NOT A DIRECT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION BUT HERE'S A DISCUSSION ON A RELATED TOPIC
DENSITY OF AIR ON MARS IS LESS THAN OF EARTH

YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DENSITY AND LIFT THRUST THE GRAVITY ON MARS IS LIKE OF EARTHS

ALSO THE ENGINE WOULDNT START

THUS THE ATMOSPHERE IS WAY TO THIN TO LIFT ANYTHING BASICALLY
CERTAINLY AN INTERESTING IDEA FOR SCIENCE FICTION THOUGH MAYBE NOT THE MOON WE HERE ON EARTH ACTUALLY NEED IT HOWEVER CAPTURING AN ASTEROID OR COMET BUILDING THAT INTO A BASE POSSIBLY BY HOLLOWING IT OUT VIA MINING THEN DRIVING AROUND WITH THAT WOULD HIT A BIT CLOSER TO REALITY IT STILL WOULD NOT BE EFFICIENT HAULING AROUND ALL THAT ROCK AT LEAST NOT WITH OUR CURRENT ENGINES IF WE CAN SOMEHOW MANAGE A RELATIONLESS ENGINE WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF THRUST THEN MAYBE WE COULD
PROBABLY NOT VERY DOABLE BUT IT WOULD BE EASIER TO BUILD A MASSIVE BASE ON THE MOON BECAUSE A SHORTER DISTANCE AND THEN MOVE IT TO MARS

WITH THE ENERGY REQUIRED TO MOVE THE MOON INTO MARTIAN ORBIT YOU COULD BUILD THE BUILDINGS ON MARS MANY TIMES OVER AND THEN SOME
FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY WE CAN PACK UP EVERYTHING WE'VE EVER BUILT ON THIS PLANET INCLUDE SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE AND THEN SEND THAT TO MARS
SO I KNOW IT'S ART AND THAT MAKES THIS QUESTION POINTLESS

BUT WHY
MPH LOOKS RIDICULOUS IN A GALLERY TYPE SETTING ALL OF THIS WAS MUCH BETTER PRESENTED ALL TOGETHER AT THE CAVERNOUS ARMORY IN NEW YORK SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT WAS DARK WITH SPOT LIGHTS AND HAD A REAL CAPRICORN ONE VIBE
THERE ART THEN THERE IS THIS ITS MADE OUT OF CRAP IT DOESN'T EVEN TRY TO BE REALISTIC OR EDUCATING ITS COMPLETELY POINTLESS LIKE ALL ART STUFF IT NOT A SPACE PROGRAM ITS SOMETHING A YEARS OLD WOULD DO TO PLAY ONLY WITH MORE TIME AND BUDGET
SINCE WE HAVE NO REAL SHIELDING IT'S A BIG PROBLEM

WHERE DOES IT ALL COME FROM

SOME OF IT WE PUT THERE AND SOME OF IT COMES FROM THE UNIVERSE ITSELF THIS TOOK ME SECONDS OF GOOGLING

CAN WE SEE IT IN PICTURES OF THE EARTH

MOST OF IT IS TOO SMALL

ADDITIONALLY IF THIS IS A PROBLEM WHAT PRECAUTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN TO REDUCE THE ORBIT OF THIS JUNK

CURRENTLY NONE
ISS AVOIDS THE DEBRIS THEY CAN TRACK BELOW THAT SIZE THE SHIELDS ARE DESIGNED TO BREAK UP THE IMPACTOR ALTHOUGH SOME PROJECTILES ARE TOO BIG FOR THE SHIELDS AND TOO SMALL TO TRACK SOME ROCKETS WILL CHOOSE TRAJECTORIES THAT MINIMIZE ORBITAL DEBRIS RISK
THERE IS NO REAL NEED TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE JUNK IT'S SIMPLY TO SPREAD OUT THE ISS WILL RARELY MAYBE A FEW TIMES A YEAR MANEUVER TO AVOID DEBRIS NO ROCKET HAS EVER HAD TO ACTIVELY AVOID DEBRIS ADAMIK

SPACE IS REALLY REALLY BIG EVEN JUST THE SPACE AROUND THE EARTH SO THE CHANCES OF A COLLISION ARE VERY SMALL THAT SAID IT STILL HAPPENS ON A RARE OCCASION
GREAT VIDEO NO SENSATIONALISM AND NOW I GET TO READ GREG PAPER IT'S HERE FOR ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED
ANYONE REMEMBER THE NEUTRINOS THAT WENT FASTER THAN LIGHT A RESULT THAT WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY TURNED PHYSICS ON ITS HEAD BUT TURNED OUT TO BE A LOOSE CABLE IN THE END

SKEPTICISM TURNED OUT TO BE CORRECT APPROACH FOR THE CERN RESULT FIVE YEARS AGO AND THINGS AS EXTRAORDINARY AS THE EM DRIVE DESERVE JUST AS MUCH SKEPTICISM

SCIENCE ISN'T ABOUT HOPE IT'S ABOUT OBSERVATIONS HYPOTHESES AND EVIDENCE SO FAR THE EM DRIVE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF ANY OF THESE THREE THINGS
HEY U ILLECTRO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS EXPLANATION FOR THE EM DRIVE

R FUTUROLOGY COMMENTS
WHY DOES HE KEEP USING THE PHRASE BREAKING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS YOU'D THINK HE WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL AND PRECISE IN HIS WORDING WHEN MAKING A VIDEO LIKE THIS ALSO THERE IS NO REASON TO TALK ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS DEVICE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT WORKS AND IF IT DOES WHATEVER THRUST IT CAN GIVE PALES IN COMPARISON TO ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD OF PHYSICS IT WOULD GIVE US IT'S LIKE SOMEONE ANNOUNCES THEY WERE ABLE TO CREATE A STAR TREK REPLICATOR AND EVERYONE STARTS DISCUSSING HOW THE EARL GREY IT MAKES WILL TASTE INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON TESTING IF IT WORKS AND HOW IT WORKS FIRST

EDIT THANKS FOR THE DOWNVOTES I GUESS I REALLY WASN'T CONTRIBUTING TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS VIDEO BUT HEY AT LEAST I'M FUN AT PARTIES
MY OFFER STANDS TO ANY INTERESTED PARTIES WHO BELIEVE IN THE EM DRIVE YOUR YEARLY INCOME WITH PROOF AT ODDS THAT THE EM DRIVE DOESN'T PRODUCE RELATIONLESS THRUST IN NEGLIGIBLE GRAVITATIONAL AND EM FIELDS IN THE ABSENCE OF ATMOSPHERE THE TRANSACTION WILL BE IN BTU VIA ESCROW ON PUBLIC RECORD THE EM DRIVE WILL TURN OUT TO BE A TRIVIAL ERROR LIKE THE NEUTRINOS BUT EVEN MORE EMBARRASSING DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION IT GOT FROM NORMIE MEDIA PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS AND STOP REGURGITATING THIS BULLSHIT
IT'S AMAZING THAT OTHER SCIENTISTS REALLY WANT THIS TO FAIL ONE AUSTRALIAN SCIENTIST SUMS UP THE GENERAL OPINION

IT S LOOKING STRONGER DR NEUMANN SAYS BUT IT S STILL BREAKING THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM WHICH IS SOMETHING WE D REALLY LIKE TO KEEP AS IT S THE BASIS OF SOME REALLY IMPORTANT BITS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

IF WE HAVE TO MODIFY IT NEWTON S THIRD LAW THAT S FINE DR NEUMANN SAYS BUT WE CAN T JUST GET RID OF IT

SO MUCH SCIENCE IS BASED ON THE FACT THE ENGINE CAN'T WORK THEY REALLY DON'T WANT IT TO BE TRUE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF ACADEMIC CAREERS WILL BE RUINED AS SCIENCE IS FORCED TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHER BASIC LAWS MAY BE FORCE A RETHINK OF EVERYTHING WE THOUGHT WE KNEW
UMM DID YOU READ THE WEBPAGE

THESE IMAGES TAKEN BY THE HIGH RESOLUTION STEREO CAMERA HRS ON BOARD ESA S MARS EXPRESS SPACECRAFT SHOW A PATCH OF WATER ICE SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF AN UNNAMED CRATER NEAR THE MARTIAN NORTH POLE
I'M SORRY IF THIS IS A STUPID QUESTION BUT I NEED TO KNOW IS THIS ICE IN THIS CRATER ABOVE THE SURFACE OR HAS THE PHOTO BEEN TAKEN USING SOME WEIRD CAMERA THAT CAN FIND ICE FROM BELOW THE SURFACE
SOURCE

IS THIS A TRUE COLOR PHOTOGRAPH IT LOOKS ALMOST FAKE PRETTY AMAZING STUFF
THE HEADLINE SUCKS THE SHUTTLE WAS THE PRODUCT OF LATE S AND EARLY S TECHNOLOGY BY STANDARDS IT WAS PRIMITIVE BUT IT STILL GOT THE JOB DONE
THE ENGINE DESIGN IN THE DRAWINGS APPEARS TO BE MORE PRIMITIVE THAN OTHERWISE THIS APPEARS TO BE A REPACKAGING OF PUBLIC KRYLON DOCUMENTS AS A CHINESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

PERSONALLY I THINK IT IS UNLIKELY TO COME TO ANYTHING BUT I ALSO THINK IT IS WORTHY OF BEING REPORTED IN R SPACE JUST IN CASE THEY HAVE DECIDED TO PUT THE FUNDS BEHIND THIS EFFORT THAT KRYLON SO OBVIOUSLY LACKS
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS SPACEPLANE AND THE KRYLON AS ENVISIONED BY REACTION ENGINES IS THAT THIS ONE LACKS THE FANCY THAT MAKE THE SABRE ENGINES OF THE KRYLON SO SPECIAL FOR THIS CHINESE SPACEPLANE THEY OPTED FOR REGULAR OLD SCRAMJET TO PROPEL THE CRAFT TO NEAR ORBITAL SPEEDS
HEH I KNOW REACTION ENGINES ARE GETTING FUNDING FOR SABRE DEVELOPMENT BUT IS SOMEONE DISHING OUT THE CASH FOR KRYLON AIRFRAME WORK CHINA COULD DO THAT AND JUST CONTRACT WITH RE FOR THE FLYING FRIDGE POWER PLANTS AFTER ALL RE IS BRITISH SO ITAR DOESN'T APPLY AND THE UK GOV ARE INCREASINGLY CHUMMY WITH CHINA
FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT FOR CHINA THEY HAVE A PLAN AND THEY ARE MEETING THEIR SCHEDULED GOALS THE FUTURE IS GOING TO SHOW WHICH IS A BETTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT A GOVERNMENT OF MOSTLY ENGINEERS WITH NO LAWYERS OR RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OR A GOVERNMENT THAT THINKS MOVIE STARS AND REALITY TV PERSONALITIES SURROUNDED BY LAWYERS AND RELIGIOUS PEOPLE IS THE BETTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT IF CHINA LEADS THE WAY IN BECOMING A MAJOR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SUPPLIER ALONG WITH A GIGANTIC ASIAN CONTINENT ELECTRIC POWER NETWORK THE US BECOMES LESS AND LESS SIGNIFICANT AS FAR AS BEING A MAJOR SPACE POWER
GIVING THE MONGOLIANS IDEAS HOW TO FINALLY GET PAST THAT DAMNED WALL

BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS GREAT JOB CHINA

I REALLY WONDER HOW AND WHAT THE SPACE RACE IS GOING TO BE LIKE
EXCELLENT WORK I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW THEIR MODULAR STATION SHAPES UP I BELIEVE IT WILL BE THE CENTERPIECE OF THEIR NEXT CREWED MISSION
I KEPT EXPECTING THE CAMERA TO SWING AROUND AS THE ROCKET REACHED ORBIT

ALSO THE REFOCUS WHEN THE LM AND CSM DOCKED WAS EXACTLY LIKE ESP

AND THEN THE CONTINUOUS MISJUDGING AT LANDING

I HAVE AN ADDICTION
SO BASICALLY IF YOU LIVE IN THE UK THERE IS NO HOPE THERE IS LIGHT POLLUTION EVERYONE AND YOU CANNOT GET AWAY FROM IT
HI R SPACE YOU GUYS ARE FAMILIAR WITH MY WORK BY NOW I'M A YEAR OLD PHOTOGRAPHER LIVING ON SPACE COAST NORMALLY I'M CREDENTIALED TO SHOOT LAUNCHES ON CCAFS PROPERTY WHICH MEANS I'LL SET UP SOUND TRIGGERED CAMERAS AT THE LAUNCHPAD BUT AS NASA WAS INVOLVED WITH THIS LAUNCH MY APPLICATION FOR CREDENTIALS WAS DENIED BECAUSE I'M UNDERAGE

THAT DIDN'T STOP ME THOUGH I HEADED TO PLAYALINDA BEACH A PUBLIC ACCESS BEACH SIX MILES NORTH OF THE LAUNCHPAD TO SHOOT THE LAUNCH INITIALLY I HAD PLANNED TO USE AN ND FILTER AS THE LAUNCH WAS SCHEDULED FOR PM AFTER AN HOUR OF HOLDS THE LAUNCH WENT AT PM MAKING THE ND FILTER UNNECESSARY

IF YOU'D LIKE TO CHECK OUT MORE OF MY WORK FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM AND CHECK OUT MY WEBSITE

EDIT SOME PEOPLE ASKED FOR CAMERA SETTINGS SO I'LL JUST LEAVE THEM HERE

SECOND EXPOSURE F ISO

NIKON TOKING MM F
I'M MOST IMPRESSED BY THE TWO PEOPLE ON THE LEFT WHO STOOD PERFECTLY STILL THE WHOLE TIME
LET'S ALL REMEMBER ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING ABOUT IF SOMEONE ASKS IF YOU'RE A GOD YOU SAY YES
I LIKE TO THINK THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF GOK WAS REAL AND FLEW OFF AS A SUPER SAIPAN
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEE FROM AUSTRALIA MY CO-WORKER AND I SAW A LIGHT THAT MOVED REALLY SLOWLY AND FOR A REALLY LONG TIME THIS MORNING AROUND I THINK IT LOOKED AMAZING WHATEVER IT WAS
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING PICTURES I'VE EVER SEEN FAN MASTIC
BEAUTIFUL SHOT WHAT WERE YOUR SETTINGS AND HOW LONG DID YOU HOLD THE EXPOSURE FOR
WHOA LOOK AT THOSE OUT PEOPLE IT'S LIKE I'M SEEING THE 5TH DIMENSION HAHA

DAMN I GOTTA STUDY ORBITS MORE ESCAPE VELOCITY AND WHAT NOT
WHAT AMAZES ME IN THIS PHOTO IS PRETTY CLEAR VISION OF WAVES CLOSER TO HORIZON ON EXPOSURE THIS LONG THOSE WAVES HAD TO HIT ALOT OF TIMES IN THE SAME PLACE TO BE PICTURED THAT CLEAR COMPARE TO ALMOST CLEAN SEA CLOSER TO PHOTOGRAPH WHERE ALL WAVES GOT BLURRED
IS THIS SATELLITE GOING TO TELL ME TO CHOOSE THE FORM OF THE DESTRUCTOR

AWESOME SHOT SO WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE CURVE OF THE TRAJECTORY I ASSUME THEY ARE LAUNCHED IN A STRAIGHT PATH BUT THE EARTH IS SPINNING AND YOU'RE ROTATING AWAY FROM THE ROCKET IS THAT IT
AFTER ALL THE SPACE PICTURES YOU HAVE SHOT ALREADY I REALLY MISS THE TWO ENTRY BURN STREAKS HERE

AMAZING PICTURE
FANTASTIC PHOTO I'VE BEEN IN FLORIDA FOR JUST OVER A YEAR AND I GOT TO SEE A LAUNCH FOR THE FIRST TIME I WATCHED FROM FORT PIERCE AND IT WAS JUST AS SPECTACULAR IT WAS A GREAT BIRTHDAY PRESENT TO MYSELF
ALWAYS ENDING UP ON MY FRONT PAGE KRAUS I DIDN'T END UP GOING OUT THERE TRYING TO RECOVER FROM THE PLAGUE NICE SHOT
THIS IS GREAT JOHN THIS LOCATION AND THE SATELLITE BEACH SHOTS ARE EVEN MORE DRAMATIC THAN THE CLOSE-UP SHOTS I MASCULINE O LOVE ALL YOUR IMAGES
YOU EVEN GOT SOME SHOOTING ROCKS IN THE TOP LEFT CORNER OR MAYBE PARTS OF THE SATELLITE
DO YOU JUST SET THIS ON A MINUTE EXPOSURE OR ARE THERE TONS OF SETTING YOU NEED TO CHANGE
AMAZING SHOT HOPE TO SEE MORE OF YOUR WORK IN THE FUTURE

FOLLOWED YOU ON INSEA
NICE WORK I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER GOOD COMPOSITION ASWELL KEEP IT UP

VIDEO COMMENT

HOW TO GO TO SPACE WITH XKCD YOU DON'T GO UP TO GO TO SPACE YOU GO FAST TO THE SIDE RELEVANT XKCD MINUTE PHYSICS
SATURN V LIFT OFF REAL TIME THERE ARE TWO THINGS AT WORK HERE AT LIFT-OFF THE ROCKETS DON'T ACTUALLY ACCELERATE THAT FAST A TESLA MODEL S ACCELERATES AT G M THE SATURN V BARELY MOVED OFF THE PAD LOOK AT THE VIDEO FOR REAL-TIME FOOTAGE BUT WHILE A CAR
ORBITAL ATK LAUNCHES TO ISS FROM NASA S WALLOPS FLIGHT FACILITY YEAH IT WAS THIS VIDEO OF ORBITAL ATK IT LAUNCHES AT LIKE SECONDS INTO THE VIDEO THEN AT JUST OVER A MINUTE PAST THE LAUNCH TIME THE GUY SAYS PASSING FEET ISN'T THERE AN EFFECT WHERE THE ROCKET EXHAUST PUSHES ON THE ATM
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
YOU'VE DONE SO GOOD WITH ALL THESE SHOTS THAT I CAN RECOGNIZE THAT YOU TOOK THEM WITHOUT SEEING YOUR NAME KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
WHENEVER I SEE THIS IN POKÉMON GO I KNOW MY POKÉMON IS ABOUT TO DIE
WORD CLOUD OUT OF ALL THE COMMENTS HETP

I HOPE YOU LIKE IT
NICE PICTURE BUT I CAN'T SEE NEITHER THE BOOST BACK BURN NOR THE LANDING BURN
U JOHNKPHOTOS GREAT COMPOSITION WERE YOU AWARE BEFOREHAND OF THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE TRAIL
SHIT WE HAD ONE OF THE CLOSEST SPOTS FROM THE ROCKET MY VIDEO PICTURE LOOKED LIKE ASS
IF I WAS IN YOUR SHOES I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT PHOTO TO TAKE I WOULD WANNA TAKE THE LONG EXPOSURE BUT ALSO A NORMAL STATIC PHOTO I'D PROBABLY SOLVE THIS WITH TWO CAMERAS
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT FOR THE LAUNCH TOO BAD IT DIDN'T LAUNCH IN EARLY PART OF THE WINDOW COULD HAVE CAUGHT THE SUNSET AT ALTITUDE NEVER GETS OLD
JUST WONDERING IF YOU LEFT THE CAMERA SHUTTER OPEN LONGER WOULD YOU SEE THE CURVE CONTINUE DOWN OVER THE HORIZON OR WAS THIS BASICALLY WHEN THE LIGHT BECAME TOO DIM TO SEE
WELL THATS WHY I COULDNT SEE IT FROM STREET AUGUSTINE ITS TRAJECTORY WAS LOW I CAN SEE SHUTTLE LAUNCHES SO I FIGURED I COULD SEE THIS ONE
SUPER MARIO GALAXY

SERIOUSLY THOUGH ASTOUNDING WORK I WISH I COULD SEE IT PERSONALLY BUT YOU KNOW BRAZILIAN AND STUFF
IT'S GREAT I REALLY LIKE THE SHADOWS IN THIS ONE DO YOU EDIT YOUR SHOTS IN PHOTOSHOP IT COULD MAKE THEM EVEN BETTER
I SOMETIMES WALK ON A PIER BY MY HOUSE THAT GIVES ME A WIDE OPEN VIEW OF THE OCEAN AND I CAN SEE A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF ARC ON THE HORIZON I'M ALWAYS IN AWE THAT THE SLIGHT AMOUNT I CAN SEE MAKES A FULL CIRCLE TO SEE THIS PHOTO ILLUSTRATES THAT BEAUTIFULLY
SO THE TRAIL JUST LOOKS CURVED TO US ON EARTH BECAUSE THE EARTH IS A SPHERE IN REALITY THE TRAIL IS A STRAIGHT LINE
ANOTHER ROCKET LAUNCH CLEARLY SHOWING NASA ROCKETS DONT GO UP INTO SPACE EARTH IS FLAT STATIONARY GEOCENTRIC CENTER OF OUR UNIVERSE AND NASA IS A FRAUD
YEP THERE IS THE PROOF WE ALL NEEDED THAT THE EARTH IS IN FACT FLAT
FLAT EARTH IT JUST LANDS IN THE OCEAN UNABLE TO PENETRATE THE DOME
I LIKE HOW THE LONG EXPOSURE HAS EFFECT ON THE OTHER OBSERVERS ALMOST AS IF TO EMPHASIZE THE FLEETING NATURE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIFE JUXTAPOSED WITH THE STEADY MARCH OF TECHNOLOGY AND PROGRESS

I'M AWARE THAT THIS WAS TRYING TOO HARD
UM GUYS I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD

GHOSTBUSTERS
USUALLY THE CALIFORNIA SITE USED TO LAUNCH WEATHER SATELLITES SO QUITE POSSIBLY A LEGIT WEATHER SATELLITE

SPY SATELLITES AT TIMES ARE LAUNCHED AS OTHER TYPES OF SATELLITES LIKE WEATHER
CLASSIC WASTEFUL GOVERNMENT SPENDING THEY WOULD GET INTO SPACE A LOT FASTER IF THEY JUST WENT STRAIGHT
REMINDS ME OF THE SHOT FROM STAR WARS VII SHOWING THE TIE FIGHTERS FLYING THROUGH THE RISING SETTING SUN
I LIKE THAT THIS IS SO ROUTINE THAT NO ONE BOTHERS

HOPEFULLY WE WILL BE JUST AS INDIFFERENT WITH PEOPLE GOING ON VACATION TO THE MOON OR MARS SOMEDAY
MAYBE I'M JUST OVERLY CYNICAL BUT YEARS IS WELL ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT HUMANITY ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE CONQUERING SPACE IS THE ULTIMATE TEST BUT WE LACK THINGS TO GET THAT FAR

ONE CAN HOPE THOUGH THAT'S WHAT I AM DOING HOPING
BOTTOM RIGHT OF THE SCREEN
IF YOU COULD POST THE DATE AND APPROXIMATE LOCATION SOMEONE CAN LIKELY VERIFY THE PASSIVE
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I HIGHLY DOUBT THIS WAS UNEXPECTED AND I BET YOU PLANNED FOR IT IN ADVANCE

I'D LOVE TO BE PROVEN WRONG THOUGH
WOW LIKE I KNEW IT WAS SMALL FROM EARTH NEVER SPOTTED IT BUT THIS PUTS IT A HOLE LOT MORE INTO PERSPECTIVE
I THINK PUTTING THE BIG RED SPOT ON FLAG WOULD LOOK EVEN BETTER
ALRIGHT PLANET FLAGS IN THE BIBLE REVELATION 2 HTTPS ROTATED URANUS AND ADDED SPOT REMOVED THE ISS FROM EARTH SINCE I FEEL LIKE THAT'S TOO MUCH DETAIL THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FLAGS AFTER ALL AND I EVEN HESITATED TO PUT IN THE MOONS AROUND JUPITER SATURN URANUS AND NEPTUNE FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY
ALSO TRUE COLOURS ARE OVERRATED
ONE SUGGESTION IS TO SOMEHOW SHOWCASE THAT URANUS AND IT'S ENTIRE SYSTEM IS LAYING ON IT'S SIDE RELATIVE TO THE PLANE OF THE ECLIPTIC THIS IS SUCH A MASSIVE ANOMALY IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FATHOM HOW THE ENTIRE SYSTEM GOT TURNED ON IT'S SIDE YET IS STILL IN THE RELATIVE PLANE OF THE OTHER BODIES AN EASY WAY TO DO SO GIVEN THAT THE SURFICIAL FEATURES OF URANUS DO NOT SHOW IT WELL IS TO HAVE THE RING SYSTEM ALMOST STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN MORE LIKE

ALSO PHOBOS AND DEIMOS ARE SO SO SMALL RELATIVE TO MARS BUT I KNOW THE SATELLITE REPRESENTATION IN THE FLAGS IS NOT MEANT TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR ACCURATE
IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF THE SUN SHRANK AS YOU GO FURTHER OUT OUT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
I FEEL BAD FOR PLUTO OUT THERE ALL COLD AND ALONE IT DOESN'T EVEN GET A FLAG
SO I CAME ACROSS THIS AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO GIVE THE OTHER PLANETS THE SAME TREATMENT
THEY LOOK AMAZING HOPE ONE DAY WE'LL HAVE TO USE THEM
I THINK YOU SHOULD GIVE JUPITER AND URANUS THEIR RINGS TOO I ALSO THINK NEPTUNE HAS RINGS
THEY'D BE INTO THIS OVER IN R VEXILLOLOGY SO I IT AND GAVE YOU CREDIT OF COURSE NICE WORK
NEAT IDEA YOU WON'T APPEASE EVERYONE I WOULD SAY THESE ARE FAR TOO COMPLEX MY GRIPES ARE

THE ISS IS TOO COMPLEX FOR A FLAG SAME WITH THE VERY TINY MOONS AROUND JUPITER FLAGS SHOULD BE EASILY IDENTIFIED CUT ANYTHING THAT ISN'T NEEDED
TOO MANY COLORS YOU WANT TO HAVE THREE OR FOUR COLORS TOPS SUN PLANET SPACE AND MAYBE ONE ACCENT COLOR JUPITER RED SPOT SATURN RINGS EARTHS LAND MASSES
ALL PLANETS ARE THE SAME RELATIVE ON EACH OBVIOUSLY THEY CANNOT BE TO SCALE BUT JUPITER IS TIMES THE RADIUS OF MERCURY SHOULD BE REFLECTED
THE SUN IS THE SAME IN ALL OF THEM DESPITE THE DISTANCES BEING TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE DIFFERENT FROM THE CLOSEST TO THE FARTHEST AS BEFORE OBVIOUSLY THEY CANNOT BE TO SCALE MAYBE YOU COULD MAKE THE SUN SMALLER IN RADIUS AND FURTHER OFF FLAG THE FURTHER YOU GET OUT
THE SATELLITES OF THE PLANETS IS A BIT MISLEADING A LOT OF THEM ARE SUB DIAMETER WHICH IS MORE LIKE AN ASTEROID THAN A MOON SOME OF THOSE ATS GANYMEDE AND TITAN ARE LARGER THAN MERCURY MAYBE ONLY INCLUDE THE SPHERICAL BODIES AROUND PLANETS AS WE KNOW ALL OF THEM WE MAY NEVER FIND ALL THE SMALL BODIES ORBITING THE GAS GIANTS BUT THE LARGE ONES ARE LOCKED IN TO THAT NOTE DEIMOS AND PHOBIES ARE WAY TO TINY TO CARE ABOUT
SHOULD THOSE LARGE JOVIAN SATURNIAN URANIAN AND NEPTUNIAN ATS GET FLAGS AS WELL WITH THE PLANET IN THE PLACE OF THE SUN AND A TINY SUN OFF IN THE DISTANCE
THANKS FOR ALL THE FEEDBACK I'VE DECIDED TO SIMPLIFY THEM AS I SAID I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF THE SHRINKING SUN BECAUSE A THE SUN IS THE COMMON FACTOR AND B IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO PROPERLY D BETWEEN PLANETS MAKES IT SO THE SUN WOULD BARELY CHANGE FOR THE PLANETS INSIDE THE ASTEROID BELT ADDED A FLAG FOR THE ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM TO REFLECT THAT

ALSO ONE MOON FOR EARTH AS OUR FIRST HOME TWO FOR MARS AS OUR SECOND ONE HOPEFULLY
I FEEL LIKE THE FLAGS NEED NOT TO BE VISUALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF PLANETS THESE ARE COOL BUT I DON'T THINK CIRCLES UPON CIRCLES ARE GOING TO DO IT

I'D BE CURIOUS TO SEE YOU DO THESE UP AS A SERIES OF TRADITIONAL DESIGNS LIKE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL TRICOLORS AND NORDIC CROSSES THEN WHEN IT CAME TIME TO DO FLAGS FOR THE MOONS YOU COULD PUT THE PLANETARY FLAG IN THE CANTON AND BUILD SOMETHING NEW FOR EACH MOON EUROPE OR TITAN WOULD NEED ITS OWN FLAG FOR INSTANCE AND COULD USE THIS COLONIAL MODEL SEE NZ OR AUS FLAGS AND THE DETAILS OF YOUR CIRCULAR DESIGN WOULD NOT GET LOST

INCIDENTALLY THIS IS MY FAVORITE FLAG OF PLANET EARTH
MPH REDACT THE SUN THEN PUT DOTTED LINES BETWEEN THE SUN AND PLANET TO INDICATE IT'S ORBIT AND YOU LEFT OUT A LOT OF MOONS OH THE ENCIRCLING DOTS ARE MOONS UM THAT'S DAMN HARD TO COUNT THEM IN THAT PATTERN
WHEN A BLACK HOLE EVAPORATES DUE TO HAWKING RADIATION IT DOESN'T GO BANG IT JUST VANISHES

YOU'VE ALMOST GOT IT BUT YOU'RE NOT QUITE PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER YOU KNOW THAT A BLACK HOLE WILL SLOWLY LOSE MASS THROUGH HAWKING RADIATION BUT THEN YOU STATE THAT AT THE END THE BLACK HOLE WILL RELEASE ALL THE MASS INSIDE IT BUT THERE ISN'T ANY ANYMORE
ALRIGHT LITTLE MAN TAKE PHYSICS AS ONE OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL OPTIONS LEARN AS MUCH AS YOU CAN REFINE YOUR THEORY FIND SOME EVIDENCE THAT BACKS UP YOUR THEORY I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THEORY OF CREATION THROUGH WHITE HOLES
I'M NOT SURE YOUR HYPOTHESIS IS CORRECT BUT YOUR ENTHUSIASM IN INCORRIGIBLE ASKING FOR CRITICISM OF YOUR IDEAS IS A HARD THING TO DO BUT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS

KEEP STUDYING AND KEEP TRYING TO REFUTE YOUR IDEAS AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR EDUCATION YOU'LL BE A GREAT CRITICAL THINKER EVEN BETTER CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION AND BECOME AN ASTROPHYSICIST THEN SPEND YOU'RE DAYS COLLECTING AND ANALYSING YOUR OWN DATA AND REALLY TRYING ANSWER THE UNIVERSE'S BIG QUESTIONS
FIRST LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR ENTHUSIASM LIKE EVERYONE ELSE THE UNFORTUNATE FACT IS THAT PHYSICS IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE COMPLICATED AND SUBTLE THAN WHAT THEY SHOW IN DOCUMENTARIES SO I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT I DON'T THINK YOUR THEORY IS VIABLE

THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ISSUES ONE IS THAT A WHITE HOLE IS NOT THE SAME AS A RADIATING BLACK HOLE IT'S AN ETERNAL LIKE A BLACK HOLE REGION OF SPACE FROM WHICH EVERYTHING MUST ESCAPE EVENTUALLY WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT A WHITE HOLE DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IN THE REAL WORLD SINCE IT HAS A SINGULARITY IN THE FAR PAST WHICH MEANS THAT THE THINGS THAT ESCAPE ARE UNDETERMINED SINCE THEY COME FROM THE SINGULARITY TO ME THIS SAYS THAT WE NEED A BETTER THEORY IF WE WANT TO CONSIDER THE EXISTENCE OF WHITE HOLES

THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT THE BIG BANG WASN'T AN EXPLOSION IT WAS SIMPLY A POINT WHERE IF YOU FOLLOW THE LAWS OF PHYSICS BACKWARDS EVERYTHING WAS INFINITELY CLOSE TOGETHER YOUR SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE COULDN'T BE A BIG BANG BECAUSE A BLACK HOLE LIVES INSIDE THE UNIVERSE WHILE THE BIG BANG IS A STATE OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE NOT AN EXPLOSION THAT OCCURRED INSIDE OF IT

THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE ALSO DOESN'T SIMPLY MEAN THAT MATTER IS MOVING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER LIKE IT WOULD AFTER AN EXPLOSION RATHER SPACE ITSELF IS EXPANDING IN A CERTAIN SENSE GALAXIES AND SUCH ARE SITTING STILL IN AN EXPANDING SPACE

IN FACT THIS POST MADE ME REALIZE THAT POPULAR DESCRIPTIONS NEVER MENTION THE FACT THAT THE BIG BANG ISN'T THE CAUSE OF EXPANSION THE CURRENT EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE ISN'T INERTIA RATHER IT'S DETERMINED BY ITS MATTER CONTENT AT EACH POINT IN TIME THE BIG BANG IS THEREFORE NOT THE CAUSE OF EXPANSION IT'S JUST ITS INITIAL POINT
UNFORTUNATELY YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE THIS THEORY I THINK IT WAS IN THE NEW SERIES OF COSMOS THAT NDT MENTIONED THE THEORY THAT WHITE HOLES COULD BE BIG BANGS WITH EACH ONE CREATING ITS OWN UNIVERSE
I THINK YOU'RE OFF-BASE BY SAYING WHITE HOLES ARE ANALOGOUS TO NEW BIG BANGS THE WHOLE POINT OF CALLING IT A BIG BANG IS THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE AND FROM IT CAME EVERYTHING

SOMEONE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT IN MY SIMILAR UNDERSTANDING A WHITE HOLE IS A THEORIZED REGION WHERE INFORMATION TAKEN INTO A BLACK HOLE ELSEWHERE IS INSTEAD PROJECTED OUT THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONE THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSE AND WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE MORE ENTIRE UNIVERSES COME OUT OF THEM WHITE HOLES OUTPUT MATTER AND ENERGY THE BIG BANG GENERATED SPACE ITSELF IT'S NOT A MATTER OF SIMPLY EXPANDING OUR PERSPECTIVE

IT WOULD BE NICE TO HEAR FROM A PHYSICIST WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS THOUGH
ON A SIMILAR NOTE ROSIE BIRTH DOUBLED THE MASS OF THE PLANET EARTH
WE ARE NEITHER MILITARILY SCIENTIFICALLY NOR MENTALLY READY FOR FIRST CONTACT WITH A SPECIES CAPABLE OF FTL OR SPEED TRAVEL

SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YOU SHOULD HOPE THAT YOU LIVE TO NEVER SEE ALIENS IN YOUR LIFETIME

WE NEED TO AT LEAST HAVE THE AI SINGULARITY OCCUR THIS CENTURY TO BE EVEN CLOSE TO READY NOW THAT IS SOMETHING YOU CAN CAUTIOUSLY EXCITED ABOUT
IT IS A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT WE WILL FIND MICROBIAL LIFE IN THIS SOLAR SYSTEM IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES IN THE SAME WE CAN BUILD TELESCOPES ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BETTER THAN THE ONES WE HAVE TODAY THIS COULD ALLOW US TO DETECT LIFE IN NEARBY SOLAR SYSTEMS OTHER THAN THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ALIEN CIVILIZATIONS WILL COME TO US BUT THIS SEEMS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE TO ME I SEE NO REASON WHY THE CENTURY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY THAN ANY CENTURY IN THE LAST BILLION YEARS
THIS IS A WAKE UP CALL FOR YOU TO LIVE THE HEALTHIEST LIFE YOU CAN SO YOU CAN HAVE A CHANCE AT ALIENS
PRETTY MIND BLOWING IF TRUE


WHAT IF WE ALREADY HAVE ALIEN LIFE WILL MOST LIKELY TAKE A FORM THAT WE AS HUMANS WILL NOT RECOGNIZE AS LIFE
WELL THERE ARE THREE POSSIBILITIES

A THE EXPANSION RATE KEEPS ACCELERATING ANY THE UNIVERSE RIPS ITSELF APART BIG RIP

B THE EXPANSION RATE REACHES SOME COMFY STEADY SPEED AND EVERYTHING JUST DIES OUT IN BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS OF YEARS

C THE EXPANSION SLOWS AND STARTS DECELERATING GRAVITY CLUMPS EVERYTHING TOGETHER AGAIN BIG CRUNCH AND THEN THAT MIGHT ALSO CAUSE ANOTHER BIG BANG BIG BOUNCE
CURRENT ESTIMATES PUT OF THE UNIVERSE CONSISTING OF DARK ENERGY THAT MAKES THE REMAINING DARK MATTER AND VISIBLE MATTER WHICH ASSUMING THE NUMBERS ALL STAY THE SAME WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO REVERSE THE ACCELERATING EXPANSION AND INDEED THE EXPANSION IS ACCELERATING I'M NO EXPERT BUT I THINK THAT'S THE LEADING THEORY AND IT MEANS THE BIG RIP IS THE ULTIMATE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE THE EXPANSION WILL EVENTUALLY OVERPOWER FUNDAMENTAL FORCES FIRSTLY GRAVITY TEARING APART GALACTIC CLUSTERS THEN GALAXIES THEMSELVES THEN STAR SYSTEMS THEN SYSTEMS THEN INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS THEMSELVES UNTIL NOTHING CAN INTERACT GRAVITATIONALLY THIS WILL THEN MOVE ON TO ELECTROMAGNETIC AND TWO NUCLEAR FORCES AFTER WHICH POINT NO TWO PARTICLES WILL EVER BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER THE UNIVERSE WILL BE AN SEA OF EXTREMELY SPARSELY SCATTERED PARTICLES
WILL THE UNIVERSE EVENTUALLY PULL ITSELF BACK TOGETHER AND GET IT'S SH T TOGETHER XD

LZ NO BAN I LOVE SPACE RELATED SCIENCE BUT I JUST COULDN'T HELP MYSELF
WHEN THE STARS EXPLODE AND CREATE BLACK HOLES WILL IT ALL PULL ITSELF BACK INTO A SUPER DENSE POINT

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN A STAR BECOMES A BLACK HOLE IT DOESN'T INCREASE IN MASS SO THE GRAVITY WILL STAY THE SAME OUTSIDE OF THE STAR'S INITIAL VOLUME SO IF THE SUN JUST BECAME A BLACK HOLE THE EARTH WOULD CONTINUE TO ORBIT IT AS USUAL AND I DON'T THINK ALL OF THE STARS BECOMING BLACK HOLES WOULD REALLY DO ANYTHING
THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE CONSISTS OF STARS AND THEIR PRODUCTS NOT ALL STARS BECOME BLACK HOLES THAT IS COLLAPSE INTO SINGULARITIES STARS ARE NATURAL RADIOACTIVE NUCLEAR FUSION REACTORS THEY ARE BURNING HYDROGEN AND HELIUM FUEL AS SPACE-TIME KEEPS EXPANDING THESE STARS WILL BURN OUT LIKE A MATCH STICK HEAD THERE WILL BE A VERY LOW ENERGY CARBON AND HEAVY ELEMENT CONCENTRATION LEFT EVENTUALLY EVERYTHING BURNS OUT AND ALL THE EXTREMELY LOW ENERGY MATTER KEEPS SPREADING FURTHER AND FURTHER APART UNTIL THERE IS NO GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION AND THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE SETTLES INTO RANDOM INFRARED ENTROPY A COUPLE DEGREES ABOVE ABSOLUTE SPACE-TIME KEEPS EXPANDING INTO INFINITY AND ATOMS EVENTUALLY ARE SPREAD SO FAR APART THEY ONLY EXIST AS IONS AND QUARKS

THE PHYSICAL OPTICAL INTERACTING TANGIBLE UNIVERSE OF NATURAL RADIOACTIVE FUSION REACTORS IS MUCH LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE A STRAW BLOWING IT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND WHEN IT POPS IT DISSIPATES INTO NOTHING
WE CAN NEVER TRILLY KNOW THE WAYS OUR UNIVERSE HAS SHIFTED BUT WE CAN BE MOSTLY SURE THAT IT EXPANDS CONSTANTLY
TL R WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE WEIRDNESS OF THE UNIVERSE AND WHAT WE DO THINK COULD BE WRONG IT JUST MIGHT BE ALIENS

GOD OF THE GAPS BUT WITH ALIENS
THIS IS A SCENARIO IN WHICH THE ACCELERATION OF THE EXPANSION OF SPACE BECOMES SO LARGE THAT IN ESSENCE THE DISTANCES BETWEEN ELEMENTARY PARTICLES BECOME SO LARGE THAT THEY CAN NOT INTERACT ANYMORE SAME EFFECT AS AN INFINITE DISTANCE SO EVERYTHING GETS RIPPED APART
NOT ONLY PLANETS BUT ALSO ATOMS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS WOULD BE DESTROYED SPACE ITSELF HOWEVER IS COMPLETELY FINE JUST EXPANDING FOREVER
THE BIG RIP DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME AT ALL

IT'S JUST A THEORY

THE UNIVERSE ISN'T A PIECE OF FABRIC

SAYS WHO

WOULD PLANETS BE TORN

PLANETS CAN EASILY BE TORN APART EASILY IN THIS CASE IS RELATIVE BUT A NEUTRON STAR WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE THAT IT WAS DESTROYING THE EARTH
NOTHING GET A PAIR OF BINOCULARS GOOD TELESCOPES START AROUND

A SCOPE THAT COSTS WILL RUIN YOUR INTEREST WILL SHOW A DECENT AMOUNT AND UNDER DARK SKIES YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE DETAIL IN ANDROMEDA BUT IN THE CITY OR SUBURBS THERE'S NO HOPE OF THAT
BINOCULARS ARE ALSO A GREAT TOOL TO LEARN THE NIGHT SKY ITS A LOT EASIER TO PAN AROUND AND TAKE A PEEK AT THE SKY THAN WITH A SCOPE I AGREE WITH GOING WITH A GOOF SET OF BINOCULARS
I SECOND BILOS DON'T SPEND ON A SCOPE

HERE'S A CHEAP WITH INFORMATIVE REVIEWS FROM STARGAZERS

REF IE DTF SHOWVIEWPOINTS
THE BEST SCOPE FOR NOW MAY BE ONE YOU DO NOT OWN FIND A LOCAL A OR AMATEUR ASTRONOMY CLUBS ARE A GREAT PLACE TO START DEPENDING WHERE YOU LIVE THAT WAY YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE DIFFERENT TYPES MEMBERS OF THE CLUB ALSO LIKELY HAVE BETTER SCOPES THAN YOU OR I WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD EVEN A DECADE FROM NOW THE BEST PART IS AT LEAST AT THE ONES I GO TO MEMBERS OF THE CLUB ARE STOKED TO EDUCATE ANYONE WHO WANTS TO LEARN ONCE YOU DECIDE TO INVEST IN ONE FOR YOURSELF REMEMBER THE BEST FIRST TELESCOPE IS ONE YOU WILL USE MOST FREQUENTLY WHICH CAN MEAN BALANCING POWER WITH PORTABILITY HALF THE FUN OF A TELESCOPE IS TO SHARE THE EXPERIENCE
ZHUMELL HAS A SALE RIGHT NOW EAST G THE FOR INSTEAD OF
THE JADED SAYS IN OTHER NEWS A NEW WEATHER SATELLITE WAS PUT INTO ORBIT

LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE PAYLOAD CAPSULE COMPARED TO THE MAIN ORBITAL LAUNCH CORE

ULA ATLAS GOES

THERE IS NEW NEWS IN WHAT SEEMS LIKE OLD NEWS ULA LAUNCH FACILITIES ARE CLEAN AND LEAN THEY ARE MAKING ORBITAL INSERTION LOOK VERY ROUTINE THE PAYLOADS ARE GETTING HUGE IT SHOWS THE COMPETITION WITH SPACE HAS RESULTED IN MAJOR EFFICIENCIES IN MAJOR AREAS IF THEY ALSO ARE ABLE TO START LOWERING LAUNCH COSTS WHILE KEEPING A FAVORABLE PROFIT IT WOULD BE GOOD NEWS ALL THE WAY AROUND
ALIASES DOZER THE TRAVELER DOZER THE DESTRUCTOR VOLVULUS ZILDROHAR LORD OF THE SEBOUILLI
IN OTHER NEWS A NEW WEATHER SATELLITE HAS BEEN PUT INTO ORBIT

OF COURSE IT IS THE MOST ADVANCED WHY WOULD ANYONE PAY TO FIRE A YEAR OLD SATELLITE INTO SPACE
I FIND THIS OFTEN USED HEADLINE VERY SILLY EVERY TIME SOME POLITICIAN OR BUSINESSMAN OPENS A NEW SITE BE IT A HOSPITAL OR A UNIVERSITY OR AN OFFICE TOWER THEY ALWAYS UNDERLINE HOW THIS IS THE MOST ADVANCED EVER OF COURSE IT BLOODY IS IT'S BRAND NEW
THE BIT YOU'RE MISSING IS PROPELLANT AN EM DRIVE DOESN'T NEED ANY THAT MEANS IT CAN ACCELERATE FOR AS LONG AS IT CAN PRODUCE POWER
DAWN THE MOST ADVANCED ION SPACECRAFT AT THE MOMENT CARRIED KG OF XENON PROPELLANT AND HAD M S OF FOR MISSIONS KG OF THAT XENON WAS USED TO REACH VESTA AND PERFORM ITS MISSION THERE AND THAT WAS SAVING PROPELLANT BY WAY OF A GRAVITY ASSIST FROM MARS A FURTHER KG WAS USED TO REACH AND ORBIT CERES DAWN HAS ONLY OF ITS PROPELLANT LEFT IT IS ESSENTIALLY OUT OF FUEL AND THUS ITS MISSIONS HAVE ENDED

AS YOU CAN SEE TRANSFER TRAJECTORIES USE UP A LOT OF PROPELLANT DAWN ONLY REACHED CELESTIAL BODIES IN TOTAL MARS VESTA CERES AND NOW ITS EMPTY BUT THOSE BODIES WERE WHAT THE MISSION PLANNERS PLANNED

IF AND IT'S A BIG IF THE EM DRIVE IS REAL THE SPACECRAFT WOULD NEVER RUN OUT OF FUEL BECAUSE IT REQUIRES NONE ITS IS ESSENTIALLY INFINITE AS LONG AS IT CAN GENERATE ELECTRICITY IT COULD VISIT ANYWHERE IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM ARE YOU DONE WITH CERES THEN LET'S MAKE A FLYBY OF VENUS DONE THERE THEN LET'S VISIT EVERY LARGE ASTEROID GOT BORED OF ASTEROIDS LET'S GO VISIT JUPITER WHY NOT

TELLING A ROCKET SCIENTIST THEY HAVE INFINITE FOR THEIR MISSIONS IS A BIG DEAL

WHETHER IT IS COST EFFECTIVE TO BUILD AN EM DRIVE SPACECRAFT VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF SCIENTIFIC DATA GENERATED IS ANOTHER MATTER HOWEVER RIGHT NOW SCIENTISTS ARE CONTENT TO SEND THEIR SPACECRAFT ON ONE WAY MISSIONS

CALL ME SKEPTICAL BUT TO RECEIVE SUCH BENEFITS FOR NO COST IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER IS THAT IF THIS DEVICE WORKS IT IS AT THE FIRST STEP OF A LONG CHAIN OF ACTIONS WHICH WILL FOCUS ON

DETERMINING WHY THE HELL IT DOES WHAT IT DOES
2 DETERMINING HOW TO MAKE THE THRUSTER MORE EFFICIENT

IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT IF THE EM DRIVE WORKS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF EFFICIENCY TO BE GAINED BY TWEAKING RF FREQUENCIES AND CAVITY CONFIGURATION THERE'S NOTHING MAGIC ABOUT MICROWAVES IF THIS PHENOMENON WORKS FOR MICROWAVES IT SHOULD WORK FOR RADIO WAVES INFRARED ETC WITH THE CORRECT RECONFIGURATION OF THE RESONANT CAVITY

IF THIS WORKS IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE TO EXPECT OUTPUTS IN THE MILINEWTON KW OR HIGHER ONCE LARGE-SCALE RESEARCH STARTS
REVOLUTIONARY BUT NOT TOO USEFUL IN THEIR PRESENT FORM AS YOUR OWN CALCULATIONS SHOW THE POWERPLANTS MASS MAY MAKE ION THRUSTERS A MORE ATTRACTIVE OPTION FOR MOST INTERPLANETARY MISSIONS
THE BIG DEAL WITH EM DRIVES IF IT PROVES TO BE REAL IS THAT THEY APPEAR TO VIOLATE 3RD LAW OF MOTION THAT'S REALLY FUCKING WEIRD SO FAR AS WE KNOW THE UNIVERSE DOESN'T LET YOU DO THAT

SO IF THE ENGINE IS REAL THEN THERE'S VERY LIKELY SOME NEW PHYSICS BEING EXPLOITED BY IT THAT WE DO NOT YET UNDERSTAND THE THRUST ISN'T THE BIG DEAL HERE IT'S HOW THE THRUST IS BEING PRODUCED
PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER THERE ARE NOW BETTER SOLAR PANELS THAN THEY BOUGHT FOR THE ISS

HERE IS THE RELEVANT PAGE FROM SPECTROLAB FOR PANEL

DATASHEETS PANEL
RIGHT NOW IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY USEFUL INSTALLING ONE CAPABLE OF COUNTERACTING THE DRAG THE ISS EXPERIENCES WOULD INCREASE POWER CONSUMPTION BY AT LEAST THAT'S A BIG DEAL AND NOT WORTH IT THEY WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO REFINE IT INCREASING THRUST AND DECREASING POWER REQUIREMENTS
I WONDER IF TWO SIDE-BY-SIDE DRIVES WOULD BE ADDITIVE OR ONE DRIVE INSIDE ANOTHER DO THEY COMBINE DESTRUCTIVELY OR CONSTRUCTIVELY OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ASTEROID MINING PUTTERING ALONG FROM ROCK TO ROCK WITHOUT NEEDING TO USE FUEL SOUNDS VERY USEFUL
WOW SUNSETS ON THE RED PLANET ARE BLUE AND SUNSETS ON THE BLUE PLANET ARE RED
THAT'S FASCINATING LOOK FROM EARTH YOU CAN SEE ORANGE BRIGHT YELLOW COLORS

THIS LOOKS GREY
I CANNOT BELIEVE IN MY LIFE TIME THAT HERE I AM SITTING ON ONE PLANET AND ABLE TO SEE IN PERFECT CLARITY AND COLOUR THE SUNSET FROM ANOTHER PLANET ENTIRELY THIS BLOWS MY MIND
ONE DAY WE WILL LIVE THERE SEE THE SUN SET AND THINK ABOUT HOW BEAUTIFUL EARTH USED TO BE
AMAZING HOW SMALL THE SUN LOOKS FROM THERE AND HOW MUCH MORE BLUE
I CLICKED AND STARTED STARING AT IT AND WAITING FOR THE SUN TO SET AND I'M LIKE THIS IS THE SLOWEST GIF EVER
NOT GONNA LIE I'M PRETTY JEALOUS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE WHO WILL GET TO WAKE UP TO THIS EVERY MORNING
YEAH IM NOT FEELING THE ROMANCE HERE THINK I'M STAYING ON EARTH FOR SUNSETS
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE DAY WHEN THE FIRST HUMANS TAKE THEIR FIRST STEPS ON ANOTHER WORLD THE INCREDIBLE THING IS IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITHIN OUR LIFETIME

REMINDS ME OF THIS PICTURE I TOOK WHILE TRAVELING THROUGH PALM SPRINGS

DCHE
I'M JUST IMAGINING THE FIRST HUMANS ON MARS WATCHING THIS AND JUST BEING LET DOWN SO MUCH
FOR SOME REASON I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GIF SO I JUST STARED AT THE PICTURE FOR LIKE A MINUTE JUST WAITING FOR THE SUN TO ACTUALLY RISE UP
SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE SCIENCE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS POSSIBLE YOU ROCK
TO THINK THAT ONE DAY HUMANS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SEE THIS IN PERSON BLOWS ME AWAY PICTURES LIKE THIS MAKE ME EXCITED FOR THE FUTURE
HOW COME IT LOOKS SO FAR AWAY COMPARED TO EARTH I GET THAT ITS FARTHER BUT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD LOOK THAT FAR AWAY
MAKES THE AIR LOOK SO COOL AND CLEAN LIKE A STRONG MISTY MORNING
SHAME US HUMANS CAN'T BREATH IT WITHOUT SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
OPENED IT UP AND TURNED MY VOLUME DOWN INSTINCTIVELY THINKING A JOHN WILLIAMS SCORE WAS ABOUT TO START BLASTING OUT MY SPEAKERS

ALIENS THEY MOSTLY COME AT NIGHT MOSTLY PRETTY MUCH THIS REMINDS ME OF THIS SCENE FROM ALIENS
GYM WHAT'S A GYM 2 AIME WHAT'S A AIME
THE CURIOUS LIFE OF A MARS ROVER NAT GEO LIVE THIS REMINDS ME OF THE MEMORABLE CLOSING STATEMENTS IN DOBIE TALK ON MARS ROVERS AND THE THING THAT MAKES ME LOVE THIS IMAGE SO MUCH IS LITERALLY THE FACT THAT SOMEDAY A HUMAN WILL STAND ON THE SURFACE OF MARS AND SAY
WANDERERS A SHORT FILM BY ERIK WERNQUIST OFFICIAL VERSION IF YOU LIKE DREAMING ABOUT THIS SUNSET THEN YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS SHORTFILM CALLED WANDERERS
STAR WARS IV A NEW HOPE BINARY SUNSET FORCE THEME ANYONE ELSE THINK OF THIS
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
IF A PERSON WAS ON MARS WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO SAFELY LOOK AT THAT WITHOUT DAMAGING THEIR EYES
THIS REMINDS ME OF THE MEMORABLE CLOSING STATEMENTS IN DOBIE TALK ON MARS ROVERS AND THE THING THAT MAKES ME LOVE THIS IMAGE SO MUCH IS LITERALLY THE FACT THAT SOMEDAY A HUMAN WILL STAND ON THE SURFACE OF MARS AND SAY I'M WATCHING THE EARTH SET AND THEN I'M WATCHING THE SUN SET

ALTHOUGH THAT WAS ONLY THE CLOSING STATEMENT THE ENTIRETY WAS INFORMATIONAL AND ENTERTAINING AS WELL AND I RECOMMEND YOU ALL TO GIVE IT A WATCH IF YOU HAVE THE TIME
IF IT'S TRUE THAT WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS AND MEN ARE FROM MARS IT'S SAD THAT WOMEN DON'T GET TO SEE THESE SUNSETS
SEEING THIS I SUDDENLY HEAR HANS ZIMMER IN THE BACKGROUND OF MY MIND

EDIT HANS NOT HAND DAMN AUTO CORRECT

EDIT OF EDIT NOT NOT NOR
AM I THE ONLY THAT SEES THAT AS INCREDIBLY TERRIFYING SO MUCH NOTHINGNESS
THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'M GETTING DISCOUNT SEATING FROM TICKETMASTER
I KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE SUN BUT I SAW THIS PICTURE AND BINARY SUNSET STARTED PLAYING IN MY HEAD
SINCE MARS HAS ONLY ATMOSPHERE COMPARED TO EARTH SHOULDN'T NORMAL SUNSETS BE VERY CLEAR
REMINDS ME OF ALIEN HERE'S ANOTHER SCREENSHOT FROM A LITTLE EARLIER
I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE IT I KNOW A LOT OF THIS IS THE PHOTO ITSELF BUT IT LOOKS LIKE FROSTED GLASS TO ME MORE LIKE A MATTE SURFACE
IF MARS IS ROUND WHY IS THE HORIZON CONCAVE SHAPED DONT TAKE THIS POST SERIOUSLY PLEASE
GIVEN THAT MARS IS FARTHER AWAY FROM EARTH WHAT SIZE WOULD THE SUN BE IN THE SKY WHEN LOOKING UP AT A MARTIAN SUNSET COMPARED TO A EARTH SUNSET WOULD THE SUN BE AS BRIGHT ON MARS MID DAY OR LESS BRIGHT WHEN COMPARED TO EARTH I ASSUME THAT THE SUN WOULD LOOK A LOT SMALLER AND WOULD GIVE OFF LESS SUNLIGHT ON MARS WHICH MEANS THAT WE HUMANS MIGHT BE LIVING IN A DARKER WORLD WHEN WE COLONIZE MARS THIS IS JUST A LAYPERSON GUESS SOMEONE SET ME STRAIGHT

THANKS
MAY SOUND LIKE A STUPID QUESTION BUT WOULD THE SUN STILL BE TOO BRIGHT TO LOOK AT
SOMEHOW OUT OF ALL THE PICTURES FROM MARS THIS ONE REALLY BRINGS IT HOME FOR ME
IS THE BLUE CREATED FROM THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT PASSING THROUGH THE GASSES OR SOME OTHER REASON
BOT BEEP BEEP I'M ALL ABOUT TOP POSTS

IF YOU LIKE DREAMING ABOUT THIS SUNSET THEN YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS SHORTFILM CALLED WANDERERS
HOW UTTERLY ALIEN AND YET FAMILIAR SPACE IS SUCH A WONDROUS PLACE
THE SUNSET ON THE MARS LOOKS VERY MUCH SIMILAR TO THAT ON EARTH THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE CANNOT LIVE ON MARS CURRENTLY BECAUSE OF NO OXYGEN AND NO WATER AND A HOT CLIMATE WOW AN EXTRAORDINARY SNAPSHOT IT IS
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN LEARNING ABOUT ATMOSPHERE TRY THE APPLE STORE GAME TERRAGENESIS IT'S A TERRAFORMING STRATEGY GAME REALLY WELL DONE
THIS HAS BEEN THE WALLPAPER ON MY PHONE SINCE THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT POSTED ON REDDIN LIKE 2 REPASTS AGO
I THINK THAT'S A STARBUCKS IN THE LOWER LEFT CORNER JUST ON THE HILL

DAMN YOU CORPORATE OVERLORDS
PFC MARS NEEDS TO GET THEIR SHIT TOGETHER OUR SUN IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN THEIRS FUCKING ARMATURES
THERE IS SO MUCH TO THIS PICTURE NOTICE HOW SMALL THE SUN LOOKS ASSUMING IT ISN'T JUST BECAUSE OF THE PICTURE IT REALLY PUTS INTO PERSPECTIVE THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATES US
I KEEP FORGETTING HOW THE SUN WOULD LOOK WAYLAY SMALLER ON MARS THAN HERE ON EARTH THAT COULD POSE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS TO ANYONE LIVING THERE LONG-TERM SO LITTLE SUNLIGHT COMPARED TO EARTH
LITTLE KNOWN FACT THE SUN IS ACTUALLY WHITE OUR ATMOSPHERE MAKES IT LOOK ORANGE BUT WHEN YOU GET OUT INTO SPACE IT'S BRIGHT WHITE
KINDA TERRIFYING SO EMPTY AND VAST STRANGE TO SEE THE SUN SO SMALL
I DIDN'T REALIZE THEY HAD COLOR CAMERAS ON MARS

OR WAS THIS COLORED AFTERWARDS
DELETED
MARS CHINA

KIDDING ASIDE REALLY HOPE THIS IS NOT FUTURE IN EARTH
HALACHA WE DON'T EVEN HAVE REAL PICTURES OF ERATH BUT WE HAVE REAL PICTURES FROM MARS
IT'S STRIKING HOW MUCH SMALLER THE SUN LOOKS FROM MARS COMPARED TO EARTH
AWD THE SUN IS SO SMALL THERE THEY WOULD REALLY BE MUCH FURTHER FROM IT THAN US
AND SOMEWHERE ON THAT HORIZON MATT DAMON IS FIDDLING WITH HIS CREW MATES SHIT AND POTATOES TRYING TO EARN A LIVING GLORIOUS
NAA NA AAA AAA NA NA AAAA AAA NA AAA NA NA NA NA NA NA AAAAAA
JESUS FUCK WE LOOK SO SMALL IN SPACE EVEN THOUGH IT'S OBVIOUS WE ARE THIS LOOKS SO MUCH MORE FUCKING REAL
I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT THE SUN APPEARS SO MUCH SMALLER HERE THEN IN A TERRESTRIAL SUNSET YOU CAN REALLY NOTICE THE KILOMETER DIFFERENCE IN DISTANCE
A DESOLATE PLANET PERHAPS THE REMNANTS OF A PAST EARTH LIKE PLANET DEVASTATED BY LIFE THAT EVENTUALLY KILLED THEMSELVES OFF OR A PLANET THAT USED TO BE CLOSER SAME ORBIT AS EARTH UNTIL IT KEEP MOVING FURTHER OUT AWAY FROM THE SUN AND NOW WE HAVE A DEAD PLANET
WOW THANK YOU FOR THIS IS THERE A SOURCE WHERE DID THIS COME FROM
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IS A A DROID THAT CAN SPEAK THE BINARY LANGUAGE OF MOISTURE EVAPORATORS
I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL WE POLLUTE MARS ATMOSPHERE SO WE CAN HAVE PROPER SUNSETS THERE TOO
VERY BEAUTIFUL I WANNA GO TO MARS NOW UPCPODCAST
IS THIS LIKE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN I TRY TO TAKE A PIC OF THE SUNSET IF SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IT'S PRETTIER
NOW THIS LOOKS LEGIT UNLIKE THE APOLLO MOON MISSION PICTURES OF EARTH IT'S FUNNY HOW WHILE APOLLO WAS IN TRANSIT TO THE MOON EARTH LOOKED KINDA FAR AWAY BUT ONCE THEY GOT THERE THE PICTURES FROM THE SURFACE MADE EARTH LOOK HUGE I STILL SUSPECT WE NEVER LANDED ON THE MOON
I FEEL LIKE SATURN WAS RIPPED OFF IN THIS PICTURE IT HAS STUNNING RINGS AND THEY LOOK COMMON HERE
YOU KNOW IRL RING ISN'T VERY OBVIOUS AS FIRST GLANCE I FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE JUST A THIN RING
JUST FYI YELLOW AND BLACK ARE THE COLORS FOR

NOT A HUGE PROBLEM BUT NOT SURE IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ACCIDENTAL POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS
AGAIN

VENUS IS A WHITE BALL NOT GREEN AND NOT BROWN LIKE NASA SHOWS IT THATS SURFACE COLOR BELOW THE CLOUDS AND WITH IR YOU SEE A WHITE BALL WITH CLOUDS BELOW WITHOUT IR OR RADAR VENUS IS A WHITE BALL

STATIC INFOCUS SOLAR

WHY DID YOU IGNORE THIS
VERY NICE THIS IS THE FIRST SPACE MISSION I REMEMBER WATCHING LIVE HAVING BEEN BORN IN I WAS TOO YOUNG DURING THE MOON MISSIONS

THERE WAS A LONG WAIT FOR THE SPACE SHUTTLE AFTER THIS
WOW THAT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN STYLE OF PAINTING DO YOU HAVE OTHER WORKS TO SHOW DO YOU SELL PRINTS
THIS IS AWESOME IT'S A SHAME THE APOLLO SPACECRAFT GOT CANCELLED THANKFULLY WE STILL HAVE SOYUZ
LOOKS LIKE AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FROM A LATE EARLY ANIME LIKE BZ OR SOMETHING NICE JOB
THIS IS SO GREAT WELL DONE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE US AND RUSSIAN SPACE AGENCIES GIVES ME HOPE FOR THE FUTURE HOPEFULLY THEIR RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS WILL FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLES
DELETED
THE CONNECTOR BETWEEN THE TWO SPACECRAFT WAS IT LAUNCHED WITH APOLLO OR SOYUZ
MY FAVOURITE BIT ABOUT THIS IS THAT THEY HAD TO DESIGN A NEW TYPE OF DOCK ANDROGYNOUS PERIPHERAL ATTACH SYSTEM BECAUSE NEITHER COUNTRY WAS WILLING TO BE THE ONE GETTING PENETRATED IN A TRADITIONAL MALE FEMALE DOCK
VERY NICE PICTURE VERY DETAILED AND THE COLORS ARE AMAZING

MY ONE GRIPE IS THAT THE APOLLO CSM IS MISSING ITS ANTENNA
I PAINT FOR A HOBBY AND THIS IS HANDS DOWN MILES AHEAD OF ME GREAT JOB I LOVE THE CLOUDS OVER THE PLANET KEEP UP THE BEAUTIFUL WORK
WOW THAT'S GOOD I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF THE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT
VERY AWESOME

CAN YOU COMMENT ON HOW YOU DID YOUR CLOUDS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON MY FIRST ACRYLIC PAINTING A MOCK UP OF A PORTION OF AN ART PIECE BY DAVID HARDY CALLED TERRAFORMING MARS THE THING I HAVE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE WITH IS MAKING CLOUD COVER THAT DOESN'T JUST LOOK LIKE BLOTCHES FROM A BRUSH
AWESOME YOU'RE VERY TALENTED NOT EVERYONE CAN SEE A PAINTING LIKE THIS THROUGH TO COMPLETION
I'LL JUST LET YOU COMPARE YOUR WORK WITH
THE LINES OF YOUR STATION IN CONTRAST TO YOUR CLOUDS ARE NOT CLEAN ENOUGH IT LOOKS STRANGE

I'M ALSO NOT SURE ABOUT THE GEOMETRICS ABOUT THE STATION TO THE RIGHT IT ALSO LOOKS BROKEN
WHEN EUROPEANS DECIDED TO GET THE HELL JUTA DODGE AND EXPLORE THE WORLD THEY WERE PRIVATE MERCHANTS SANCTIONED AND PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THEIR MONARCHS IS IT TIME FOR NASA JPL ETC TO BE DISMANTLED OVER TIME AND LET THE PRIVATE COMPANIES WITH GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT TO TAKE OVER OUR NEXT STEPS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION

IT JUST SEEMS THAT POLITICAL BUREAUCRACY HAS CONSTANTLY GOTTEN IN THE WAY SINCE THE LAST MOON LANDING
HAVE WE CONSIDERED ORBITAL ECCENTRICITY AS A POSSIBLE FACTOR IN CLIMATE CHANGE
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF TIME STOPS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL
WHY DO WE WANT TO TERRACIFORM OTHER PLANETS COULDN'T WE JUST TERRACIFORM EARTH AND MAKE IT MORE HABITABLE IF WE NEEDED TOO IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE THE EASIER OPTION
I HAVE KIND OF AN ASTROPHYSICS QUESTION IF THAT IS OK
ONE OF MY TEACHERS TOLD ME A STORY OF SOMEBODY THAT ACCIDENTALLY LOOKED AT AN EXPERIMENT THAT GAVE OFF A LOT OF HARMFUL LIGHT THAT HE WAS NOT SUPPOSE TO LOOK AT HE ONLY TOOK A GLANCE BUT SUPPOSEDLY HIS EYE BASICALLY MELTED AS HIS RETINA STARTED TO FALL OFFICIAL
GIVEN THIS WHY DOES THIS NOT HAPPEN WHEN WE LOOK AT LIGHT FROM A STAR THAT IS LIKELY MUCH MORE HARMFUL THAN THE EXPERIMENT I CANNOT CITE YOU A PARTICULAR INSTANCE OR A PARTICULAR STAR BUT IN THEORY IT IS STILL PUZZLING TO ME
NOT REALLY SPACE SPECIFIC BUT SEMI RELATED HAVE ANY OF YOU BEEN ON THE VOMIT COMET I'M CONSIDERING THAT AS SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE BUCKET LIST SINCE I DON'T THINK SPACE FLIGHT WOULD BE IN MY FUTURE WHAT'S THE EXPERIENCE LIKE
I NEED YOUR HELP FOR MY FINALLY PROJECT FOR SCHOOL I WANT TO CREATE A BOOK ABOUT STARS LIFE CYCLE AND FOR THAT IT WOULD BE AMAZING IF I COULD GET AS MANY AS YOU TO DO THIS SURVEY I HAVE CREATED A SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STARS AND HOW I CAN MAKE IT INTERESTING FOR A READER LIKE YOU

IF YOU HAVE THE TIME PLEASES COMPLETE THIS SURVEY BY ANSWERING ITS QUESTIONS

FORMS D E FORMRESPONSE

THANK YOU
HELP ME BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BIG BANG THEORY HOW IS IT THAT ONE ATOM CAN BE THE SOURCE OF ALL MATTER ON EARTH HOW WAS THAT FIRST PIECE OF MATTER CREATED

FYI I'M NOT AN PERSON BY ANY MEANS SO PLEASE DON'T HATE
SO HOW FAR AND HOW MUCH LIGHT YEARS AWAY CAN WE ACTUALLY SEE USING OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY TELESCOPE ETC ETC
HOW HIGH DOES AN AIRCRAFT HAVE TO GO FOR RCS THRUSTERS TO BE REQUIRED I'M ASSUMING THERE ARE X FANS AROUND HERE
THE GREY FRAME STRUCTURE IN BAIKONUR COSMODROME WHAT IS IT

EN ISS ISS PHOTO

IN THE VEHICLE ASSEMBLY BUILDING IN BAIKONUR COSMODROME THEY ARE ASSEMBLING A PROGRESS MS CARGO FERRY FOR LAUNCH NEXT MONDAY TO THE ISS THIS IS WHERE SOYUZ AND PROGRESS ARE ASSEMBLED THIS HAS BEEN DONE HERE FOR MANY YEARS YOU CAN SEE THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ON THE ANERGIA WEBSITE FOR REGULAR UPDATES YELLOW STRUCTURES FRAMES TO HOLD THE SPACECRAFT
BUT WHAT IS THE LARGER GREY STRUCTURE FRAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDING
ANYBODY GUESS
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHY HAVE THEY SPENT SO MUCH EFFORT TRYING TO LAND THESE BOOSTERS WOULDN'T IT BE A LOT MORE TECHNICALLY SIMPLE TO ENGINEER A SYSTEM WITH SOME SORT OF REUSABLE PARACHUTE AIRBAGS TO GET THEM TO THE GROUND SAFELY I MEAN IT'S NOT AS ELEGANT BUT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE SAME RESULT WITH A LOT LESS EFFORT AND UNCERTAINTY
WHAT WILL THEY ACTUALLY TRAVEL IN TO MARS WHAT ARE THE CURRENT IDEAS
IS THERE A BETTER METHOD BEING RESEARCHED ON LAUNCHING ROCKETS PERHAPS CHEAPER AND MORE CONVENIENT

I AM TEARING MY HAIR OUT TRYING TO REMEMBER A ROCKET DESIGN THAT THE US ARMY AIR FORCE LOOKED INTO IN THE COLD WAR CAN ANYONE HELP ME

IT WAS DESIGNED AS A SUBORBITAL SPACECRAFT FOR TRANSPORTING IMPORTANT PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT ACROSS THE WORLD FOR RAPID RESPONSE CAPABILITY IT WAS SINGLE STAGE WITH FUEL TANKS AT THE SIDE THREE PAIRS THAT DROPPED OFF AND WERE RECOVERED THE TANKS HAD PARACHUTES ABOARD AND THE REST OF THE FIRST STAGE DID VTOL IT USED ITS ENGINES AS A HEAT SHIELD IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THE TERM WAS LIKE NOZZLE PLUG HEAT SHIELD OR SOMETHING I FEEL AS IF THE ORIGINAL NAME WAS SOMETHING MATHEMATICAL LIKE PARALLELOGRAM OR RHOMBUS BUT NEITHER OF THOSE GIVE ANY RESULTS FROM A QUICK GOOGLE CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT HERE
WHEN THEY SAY EMDRIVE COULD BRING US TO MARS IN ABOUT DAYS DOES IT IMPLY DAYS ACCELERATING AND DAYS DECELERATING IS THERE SUCH A THING AS TOP SPEED WITH THAT KIND OF ENGINE I KNOW IT MUST BECAUSE IT WOULD BREAK LAWS AND THINGS
I HOPE THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO ASK THIS QUESTION

IS IT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO APPLY FOR A NASA SOCIAL MEDIA PASS HOW DO I GET STARTED IN THE PROCESS AND WHAT IS REQUIRED
I JUST REALIZED THAT THE CLEAREST SKY I EVER SAW WAS NOT AS CLEAN AS I THOUGHT ACCORDING TO

I LIVE IN ASTORIA NYC AND I WANT TO STARGAZE BUT WHERE DO I BEGIN
WHAT LEGISLATION THAT CONCERNS SPACE EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH IS CURRENTLY BEING DEBATED IN CONGRESS AS A FLORIDA VOTER BOTH OF MY US SENATORS SIT ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR SPACE SCIENCE AND COMPETITIVENESS IN AN EFFORT TO BECOME MORE POLITICALLY ENGAGED ABOUT ISSUES I CARE ABOUT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WRITE TO MY CONGRESSMEN ABOUT LEGISLATION THAT AFFECTS SPACE EXPLORATION AMONG OTHER THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO FIND A RESOURCE TO BECOME MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE LEGISLATION THAT IS BEING DEBATED AND BE ABLE TO SPEAK MORE INTELLIGENTLY THAN JUST A GENERIC I WANT YOU TO SUPPORT NASA AND COMMERCIAL SPACE EXPLORATION
NEWS ARTICLE

ANOTHER WARRANTLESS FAKE FACEBOOK STORY WHAT'S THE REAL EXPLANATION
AREN'T THEY BASICALLY DESCRIBING A GOD LIKE FORCE SOUNDED TO ME LIKE RELIGION MASKED WITH SOME FANCY SCIENCE WORDS
THIS IS WHAT SCHARF THOUGHT OF THE ARTICLE
I FEEL LIKE I JUST WALKED THROUGH A BEADED DOORWAY TO READ THAT HIPPY GARBAGE
LOTS OF PROGRESS COMPARED TO THE LAST TIME I TRIED

I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE NEXT SUPERMAN MOVIE SHOULD BE FILMED
THAT LAST MOMENTS OF THE VIDEO WITH FEMALE ASTRONAUT FLYING WAS VERY INSPIRATIONAL
WHAT AN INSANE PHOTO I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH AN UP CLOSE SHOT AND THE LIGHTING ANGLE OF THE SUN HELPS PUT PERSPECTIVE INTO WHAT I'M LOOKING AT OTHERWISE IT WOULD JUST LOOK LIKE MEANINGLESS PATTERNS TO ME AND ARE THOSE THE RINGS IN THE TOP RIGHT

IS THIS IMAGE DOCTORED IN ANY WAY OR ARE THOSE COLORS WHAT YOU WOULD SEE WITH YOUR EYE
JEEZ LOOKS LIKE SATURN GOTTEN ITS OWN THIRD IMPACT SOME TIME AGO

WHAT AN AGE WE LIVE IN TO BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY WITNESS SUCH SPECTACULAR THINGS BUT ALSO TO JUST RANDOMLY GO ONLINE AND CASUALLY LEARN ABOUT THEM
IT'S FASCINATING THAT THERE IS A NEARLY PERFECT HEXAGON THAT NATURALLY FORMED ON SUCH A LARGE SCALE MUCH LESS ONE SO MASSIVE
I DIDN'T EVER THINK I'D BE ABLE TO SEE THIS SO FRIGGING COOL REMINDS ME OF IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THE MOST IDEA I HAD OF SATURN WAS MAKING THE SOLAR SYSTEM OUT OF PAPER MACHE
WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AT THE POLAR RED CIRCLE IS THIS KIND OF A HURRICANE LIKE CLOUDS CIRCLING AROUND THAT SPOT DOES SOMEBODY KNOW
FIRST YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT IS CALLED THE OBSERVATIONAL SPHERE THAT IS THE SPHERE SURROUNDING YOU WITH YOU IN THE CENTER DUE TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT THAT SPHERE REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE YOU CAN SEE IN ANY DIRECTION

YOU CAN'T SEE FARTHER BECAUSE LIGHT PAST THAT POINT CAN'T GET TO YOU

NOW THERE IS NO CENTER TO THE UNIVERSE BUT EVERY POINT IN THE UNIVERSE IS THE CENTER OF ITS OWN OBSERVATIONAL SPHERE

SO LET'S PRETEND THAT YOU ARE LIGHT YEAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT MEANS YOU CAN SEE LIGHT YEAR TO YOUR RIGHT MORE THAN I CAN LIKEWISE I CAN SEE LIGHT YEAR TO MY LEFT MORE THAN YOU CAN

SO THE UNIVERSE IS FAR LARGER THAN WE CAN SEE AND GETTING LARGER DUE TO ACCELERATED EXPANSION

BUT WHAT SHAPE IS THE UNIVERSE AMAP SURVEY PUTS THE UNIVERSE AS FLAT TO A SMALL DEGREE OF ERROR AND THUS MOST LIKELY INFINITE HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW OTHER TOPOLOGICAL SHAPES THE UNIVERSE COULD BE IN WHICH WOULD NOT BE INFINITE

THIS ACTUALLY BOILS DOWN TO WHAT HAPPENS TO PARALLEL LINES OVER A GREAT INTERSTELLAR DISTANCES DO THEY STAY PARALLEL DO THEY CONVERGE OR DO THEY DIVERGE

IF THEY STAY PARALLEL THE UNIVERSE IS INFINITE AND FLAT IF THEY DO NOT STAY PARALLEL THE UNIVERSE IS SOME OTHER SHAPE EG IF THEY CONVERGE THE UNIVERSE COULD BE THE TOPOLOGICAL SURFACE OF A SPHERE

ALSO IF THE UNIVERSE IS FLAT AND INFINITE THEN MOVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE WILL NEVER TAKE YOU BACK TO YOUR STARTING POINT ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE UNIVERSE IS THE TOPOLOGICAL SURFACE OF A SPHERE YOU WOULD EVENTUALLY RETURN TO YOUR STARTING POINT

IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS SO HUGE THAT PARALLEL LINES APPEAR TO STAY PARALLEL WITHIN OUR OBSERVATIONAL SPHERE BUT THAT WOULD GO AGAINST WHAT MOST OF PHYSICS HAS TO SAY ABOUT THE UNIVERSE AND HOW IT FORMED

AS PER HOW UNIVERSES ARE FORMED POPULAR HYPOTHESIS INCLUDE

COLLISION OF TWO 2D BANES IN STRING SPACE

SPECIAL BLACK HOLE HYPOTHESIS CERTAIN TYPES OF BLACK HOLES IN UNIVERSES CAN CREATE 3D UNIVERSES

QUANTUM FOAM HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE HYPOTHESIS THE UNIVERSE IS NOT AS IT APPEARS BUT RATHER WE LIVE ON A TOPOLOGICAL SURFACE

BIG BOUNCE THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS IN CYCLES

COMPUTER SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS THE UNIVERSE IS A COMPUTER SIMULATION

AND AS ALWAYS I LIKE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THERE MAY BE MORE THAN ONE WAY FOR A UNIVERSE TO FORM
CHECK OUT SPACE RIP ON YOUTUBE WATCHING THAT LATE AT NIGHT SOME TIMES MAKES ME QUESTION IF LIFE ITSELF IS REAL IT'S MIND BOGGLING
ABOUT THE WHY QUESTIONS YOU ASKED I'M AFRAID NOBODY HAS THE DEFINITIVE ANSWERS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS YOU DO LET ME POINT YOU TO READ A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME BY STEPHEN HAWKING

EVEN IF THERE IS ONLY ONE POSSIBLE UNIFIED THEORY IT IS JUST A SET OF RULES AND EQUATIONS WHAT IS IT THAT BREATHES FIRE INTO THE EQUATIONS AND MAKES A UNIVERSE FOR THEM TO DESCRIBE THE USUAL APPROACH OF SCIENCE OF CONSTRUCTING A MATHEMATICAL MODEL CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OF WHY THERE SHOULD BE A UNIVERSE FOR THE MODEL TO DESCRIBE WHY DOES THE UNIVERSE GO TO ALL THE BOTHER OF EXISTING

WIKI

RELATIVIDADE




THE COSMOS SERIES TOUCHED ON THIS SOMEWHAT

HOWEVER STRICTLY SPEAKING THERE'S NOTHING WE KNOW IN THE LAWS OF PHYSICS THAT WOULD DICTATE AN END TO SPACE ASSUMING THE BIG BANG AND COSMIC EXPANSION THEORIES HOLD UP THINGS WILL JUST KEEP TRAVELLING FURTHER AND FURTHER APART UNTIL THE BASICS OF MATTER DISINTEGRATE THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE IF SPACE STOPPED THAT WOULD MEAN THERE WAS A WALL OF SORTS AND THAT WOULD HAVE HUGE IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH SCIENTIFIC THEORY AND POSSIBLY THEOLOGY

IF YOU COULD REACH THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE IN THE FIRST PLACE MOST LIKELY YOU'D JUST KEEP GOING AS THERE WOULD LITERALLY BE NOTHING TO STOP YOU
REGARDLESS IF IT DOES OR DOESN'T I HIGHLY DOUBT WE AS HUMANS WILL EVER KNOW IT'S EXTREMELY HARD TO EVEN GRASP THE NUMBERS INVOLVED IN THE DISTANCE WE DO KNOW IT EXTENDS TO LIGHT HAS BEEN TRAVELING FOR BILLION YEARS AT KM NEARLY TRILLION MILES PER YEAR

EVEN IF OUR SPECIES EVER MAKES IT OFF THIS ROCK IT'S ALMOST UNTHINKABLE TO EVEN MAKE IT OUT OF JUST THE SPACE WE CAN SEE
THERE'S DEFINITELY NO ENDING IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A MASSIVE WALL OR GLASS THAT YOU CAN'T GO FURTHER MAYBE IT'S A SPHERE NO ONE KNOWS AND PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT
THINGS EXIST BECAUSE THEY ARE CREATED

LETS SAY SHAPED OR FORMED
CREATION IMPLIES CREATION OUT OF NOTHING

CARS PHONES ETC ALL EXIST BECAUSE SOMEONE CREATED THEM

RIGHT

IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND DON'T BELIEVE THAT AN ALMIGHTY GOD CREATED THE EARTH HOW AND WHY DOES THE UNIVERSE EXIST

TWO CHOICES MATERIAL UNIVERSE ALWAYS EXISTED FOR SOME REASON

OR SOMETHING IMMATERIAL CREATED THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE

THIS IMMATERIAL THING ALWAYS EXISTED FOR SOME REASON

EITHER WAY WE CAN'T ESCAPE ETERNITY


HOW FAR DOES SPACE GO IS IT ENDLESS

IF WE KNOW THE CURVATURE OF SPACE WELL AND IT IS SAID TO BE FLAT THEN ITS I DON'T KNOW


WELL EVEN IF SPACE DID HAVE AN END TO IT WE WILL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE WE CANT TRAVEL FAR ENOUGH TO FIND OUT
HOW AND WHY DOES THE UNIVERSE EXIST

NOBODY KNOWS AND YOU KNOW THAT STOP ASKING STUFF THAT NOBODY HAS AN ANSWER TO

IF THE YELLOW IS MEANT TO RESEMBLE THE SUN I SUGGEST MAKING IT WHITE SINCE THAT'S THE SUNS TRUE COLOR
REVISION HERE
WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE LL KNOW WHETHER THE NEAREST PLANETS TO US HAVE GOT LIFE ON THEM

SIMPLY BASED ON TESS LOOKING AT THE COMPOSITION OF THEIR ATMOSPHERES SORRY IF I MISSED SOMETHING SKIMMING THIS ARTICLE BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE A STRETCH

THERE I WAS HAPPY IN MY OWN LITTLE WORLD I WAS SURE THAT MARS WAS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP FOR MANKIND IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME

THEN U PRESIDENTE MADE A ONE SENTENCE POST ON REDDIN THAT CHANGED MY MIND FOREVER HIS ARGUMENT THOUGH BRIEF WAS SOUND AND ENTHUSIASTIC THAT MAN CHANGED MY MIND FOREVER MARS WAS NO LONGER MY DREAM NO NOW I CHOOSE TO GO TO THE MOON
I THINK A BASE OF SOME KIND ON THE MOON MIGHT BE A GOOD INVESTMENT IF LAUNCHING CRAFTS TO MARS AND TITAN WOULD SAVE FUEL VERSUS LAUNCHING FROM EARTH NOT SURE I SEE THE POINT IN ANOTHER MOON MISSION OTHERWISE
HAVING A MARS COLONY WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE IF THINGS GO TO SHIT ON EARTH CLIMATE CHANGE NUCLEAR WAR ETC HUMANS MIGHT NOT GO EXTINCT
WHY SO EXPENSIVE AND NO RETURN OF THE INVESTED MONEY AND WE'VE BEEN THERE ALREADY

ANOTHER VIDEO FROM FURTHER OUT

A GORGEOUS VIDEO SHOWING OFF THE FIRST MOMENTS OF THE ARIANE LAUNCH EARLIER THIS WEEK IN SUPER SLOW MOTION WATCHING THE UMBILICAL DROP AWAY AS THE EXHAUST PLUME BILLOWS UP AND THE ENGINES COME INTO VIEW IS VERY FASCINATING I ALSO LIKE THE CLIP I POSTED AT THE START OF THIS COMMENT WATCHING JUST HOW QUICKLY THE EXHAUST SHOOTS OUT OF THE FLAME TRENCH ON THE RIGHT

THE LAUNCH IN QUESTION LAUNCHED GALILEO SATELLITES INTO ORBIT THESE SATELLITES MAKE UP PART OF NAVIGATION CONSTELLATION THAT GIVES THEM INDEPENDENT ACCESS TO SATELLITE NAVIGATION SERVICES LIKE AMERICA'S GPS SYSTEM R ARIANESPACE HOSTED A LAUNCH THREAD FILLED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE LAUNCH
I'M SORRY ALL I GOT WAS THAT A FORMER FROZEN HELL BECAME A NICE MEADOW THEN CAPTIONS BLOCKED OUT THE TEXT AT THE TOP

IS THERE A WAY TO WATCH THE VIDEO WITHOUT CONSTANT WHITE TEXT AT THE TOP OF THE VIDEO
BULLSHIT VIDEO VIDEO PREVIEW SHOWS WHILE ACTUAL VIDEO STATES

THIS VIDEO LOSES ANY CREDIBILITY IT HAD IF ANY SINCE IT CAN'T EVEN KEEP THE INFORMATION STRAIGHT
OH BOY MELANCHOLY ANYONE NO JUST ME THEN OK I'LL BE OVER HERE
THEY BROUGHT SOME VELCRO STRAPS THOUGH
SEEMS LIKE THE ISS ASTRONAUTS ARE A BIT BETTER AT HOLDING STILL IN G

I CERTAINLY HOPE ESA AND THE OTHER ISS PARTNERS CAN EVENTUALLY WORK TOGETHER IN HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT EITHER ON ISS OR A FUTURE TANGOING
IF EM DRIVE PRODUCES MN KW OF THRUST THAT SEEMS LIKE VERY LITTLE HOW MUCH THRUST DO WE NEED TO HEAD TO MARS MOON

IT'S TINY RELATIVE TO A TRADITIONAL CHEMICAL ROCKET BUT A COUPLE OF ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE MORE THAN OTHER RELATIONLESS DRIVES LIKE A PHOTONIC ROCKET

YOU NEED TO GET INTO LEO VIA TRADITIONAL MEANS AND THEN ANY AMOUNT OF CONSTANT THRUST WILL GET YOU TO THE MOON OR MARS IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TIME

ALSO GIVEN THAT NO-ONE KNOWS FOR SURE HOW THE THING WORKS SUGGESTS TO ME THAT NO-ONE KNOWS FOR SURE HOW TO OPTIMIZED THE THRUST SO MAYBE THERE'S SCOPE TO INCREASE IT SIGNIFICANTLY

FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IF IT DOES WORK AND THAT'S STILL A BIT IF WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM RATHER SIMILAR TO IF HOMEOPATHY WAS SHOWN TO WORK


I THINK THAT THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS LESS USEFUL FOR A MARS JOURNEY AND MORE USEFUL FOR SOMETHING INTERSTELLAR WHERE A TINY ACCELERATION CAN ADD UP A TRIP TO MARS DOESN'T SEEM LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE USE OF SUCH A SMALL BUT FAIRLY EFFICIENT THRUST

EDIT JUST REALISED THAT THE JOURNEY TO MARS IN DAYS COMMENT WAS MADE BY A PARTICULARLY WELL QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL SO MAYBE I SHOULD SHUT UP
HOW MUCH THRUST DO YOU NEED TO CREATE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY OF DUE TO ACCELERATION IS THIS JUST SCIENCE FICTION CONCEPT

YOU NEED TO BE ACCELERATING M S ALL THE TIME WHICH IS COMPLETELY IMPRACTICAL
HOW MUCH THRUST DO WE NEED TO HEAD TO MARS MOON

DEPENDS HOW FAST YOU WANT TO GET THERE

IS THIS JUST SCIENCE FICTION CONCEPT

WE DON'T HAVE IT YET DO WE SO YES

MARS IN DAY HOW MUCH ACCELERATION DO WE NEED TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN

A LOT

WHAT'S OUR TOP SPEED AROUND

VOYAGER KM SEC


THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF HOOPLA OVER A MINIMAL SOURCE OF NET THRUST NOT SURE WHAT THE HIPSTER FASCINATION IS IT IS SIMILAR TO THE BRAITHWAITE MACHINE WHICH TWO OPPOSING GYROSCOPES AT HIGH ROTATION RATES DO RESULT IN A SMALL NET LIFT FORCE IT ONLY REDUCED THE WEIGHT OF THE BOX IT WAS IN

IT IS HARD TO DETERMINE WHAT THE APPEAL IS INSANELY HIGH THRUST WITH FRACTIONAL LIGHT VELOCITY IS POSSIBLE NOW WITH FAIRLY BASIC HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY WE ALREADY HAVE A ROCKET GETS ITS THRUST FROM AN EXPLOSION IN THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER BEING TURNED INTO ACCELERATION BY THE VENTURI EXIT OF THE NOZZLE THE ROCKET EXHAUST IS CLOSE TO A PLASMA STATE AND CAN BE ELECTROMAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICALLY ACCELERATED BY LARGE FIELD COILS AROUND THE NOZZLE BELL THIS IS CALLED ELECTROHYDRODYNAMIC BHD PROPULSION THE PROBLEM IS THE ELECTRICITY FOR THE COILS HAS TO BE GENERATED AND THE COIL WEIGHT HAS TO BE ADDED INCLUDING THE TYPE OF POWER PLANT GENERALLY A PLUTONIUM REACTOR GENERATOR IT ISN'T PRACTICAL FOR A LAUNCH DELIVERY SYSTEM BUT AS A THIRD STAGE SPACE CRAFT IN ORBIT IN PREPARATION FOR DESTINATION INSERTION THE WEIGHT ISN'T A LIMITATION THE BIG TECHNICAL PROBLEM NOW ARE THE COILS THEY CAN'T BE JUST COPPER AND SILVER MIGHT BE A BETTER CONDUCTOR BUT NOT USABLE EITHER IT WILL NEED TO BE A VERY STRONG COMPOSITE SUPERCONDUCTOR AND THAT TECHNOLOGY MIGHT TAKE AWHILE
I THINK WE'VE HAD BETTER SOURCES FOR THIS RECENTLY THAN THE HUFFINGTON POST AND IF IT WORKS IT WOULDN'T BREAK THE LAWS OF PHYSICS IT WOULD MEAN THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE DIFFERENT THAN WE CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND
FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH WHAT PEER REVIEW IS IT DOESN'T TEST THE VALIDITY OF CLAIMS IT CHECKS WHETHER THE METHODOLOGY OF TESTING IS FLAWED THE ORIGINAL SUPERLUMINAL NEUTRINO PAPER IS AN EXAMPLE METHODOLOGICALLY SOUND BUT LATER TURNED OUT TO BE INCORRECT DUE TO EQUIPMENT ISSUES
CAN SOMEONE WITH RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE TELL ME HOW REALISTIC IT IS TO EXPECT THIS THING TO WORK WELL ENOUGH TO BE USEFUL IN SPACE

IF IT WORKS WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SPACE TRAVEL
THE NEXT STEP FOR THE EM DRIVE IS FOR IT TO BE TESTED IN SPACE WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO HAPPEN IN THE COMING MONTHS WITH PLANS TO LAUNCH THE FIRST EM DRIVE HAVING BEEN MADE BACK IN SEPTEMBER

THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT I AM WAITING FOR LET'S SEE HOW IT WORKS IN THE FIELD
PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS FOR THE WRONG REASON

IT'S UTILITY FOR SPACE TRAVEL IS MUCH LESS SIGNIFICANT THAN THE FACT THAT WE CAN BUILD A MACHINE THAT DOES SOMETHING BUT WE CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY

THEN SOMEONE LIKE EINSTEIN COMES ALONG AND COMES UP WITH A THEORY THAT FITS ALL THE WEIRD DATA

IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR US TO PEEL ANOTHER LAYER OFF OF THE UNIVERSE

EDIT IF YOU INTO LEARNING HOW THINGS WORK CHECK OUT R SKOOKUM I HOPE THE MODS WON'T MIND THE PLUG
ANYONE GOT A BLDR ON WHAT AN EM DRIVE IS CAN'T GET THE ARTICLE TO OPEN ON MY TABLET
ITS JUST A BUG IN THE UNIVERSE EXPECT THIS EXPLOIT TO BE FIXED IN THE NEXT PATCH
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF REASONS TO DOUBT TO THIS BUT HOLY SHIT THIS IS EXCITING IF THE UPCOMING TESTS OF THIS CONTINUE TO VERIFY THE LEGITIMACY OF IT WE ARE WITNESSING LAWS OF PHYSICS BEING REWRITTEN
DAMNIT I PROMISED MYSELF THAT I WOULDN'T GET EXCITED ABOUT THIS AGAIN I'M EXCITED AGAIN
I JUST IMPRESSED THAT WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE COMMENT SECTION OF REDDIN THAT ARE SMARTER THAN THE SCIENTIST AT NASA
SO ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE COMMENTS BELOW THE EFFICIENCY OF THE DRIVE IS MN KW THAT IS YOU GET MN FOR EVERY KILOWATT YOU GIVE THE DRIVE

WHERE DOES ALL THAT ENERGY GO IS A KILOWATT DISSIPATED FROM THE DRIVE AS HEAT IF SO WE'LL HAVE TO INVENT BETTER RADIATORS BEFORE WE SCALE THE DRIVE TO ANY SIGNIFICANT SIZE OR IT WILL MELT WHATEVER IT IS INSTALLED UPON
THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF STANDING ON A HATCH PULLING UP AND IT OPENING THE FORCES SHOULD PERFECTLY CANCEL OUT
BETWEEN THIS THING WORKING AND TRUMP WINNING I'M JUST GOING TO ASSUME THE MASSIVE COMPUTER THAT SIMULATES THE WORLD WE LIVE IN IS RUNNING OUT OF RAM AND IS JUST OUTPUTTING GIBBERISH
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT RELATIONLESS



I'LL SEE MYSELF OUT

I'M A BOT AND I FIRST SAW THIS THREAD AT NOV UTC
I'VE SEEN ACRONYMS IN THIS THREAD THE MOST COMPRESSED THREAD COMMENTED ON TODAY R SPACE COMMENTS HAS ACRONYMS
ACRONYM LISTS CONTACT CREATOR PHS SOURCE CODE
OF COURSE THIS IS JUST ONE HYPOTHESIS BASED ON ONE ROUND OF TESTS THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE WE CAN SAY FOR SURE WHETHER THE EM DRIVE IS REALLY PRODUCING THRUST THE TEAM NOTES THEY THAT MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERMAL EXPANSION COULD SOMEHOW BE SKEWING THE RESULTS

AND EVEN ONCE THAT'S CONFIRMED WE'LL THEN NEED TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

AND IT WORKS
THERE NEEDS TO BE A WEBSITE THAT CATEGORIZES POPULAR SCIENCE INTO BUCKETS LIKE PEER REVIEWED NOT DUPLICATED PEER REVIEWED AND DUPLICATED UNREVIEWED UNDUPLICATED ETC AND ASSIGNS CREDIBILITY LEVELS BASED ON THAT INFO
CAN WE NOW STOP DISMISSING THIS CONCEPT AS PSEUDOSCIENCE HOW ELSE DO SOME PEOPLE IMAGINE TRULY NEW DISCOVERIES ARE MADE I AM HAPPY THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME RESEARCHERS OUT THERE TRYING NEW STUFF EVEN WHEN THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE IT SHOULD WORK HEARING THAT DISCUSSIONS ON R PHYSICS WERE DELETED MAKES ME SICK FINDING RESULTS THAT FLY INTO THE FACE OF ESTABLISHED THEORIES DOES NOT MAKE IT WRONG BUT WE SHOULD DISCUSS WHERE THE ERROR LIES
I'VE BEEN CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ON THIS LITTLE GEM FOR A FEW YEARS NOW MY OPTIMISM WAS BASED ON A GUT FEELING THAT THERE HAS TO BE A SIMPLE WAY TO MAKE A RELATIONLESS DRIVE WORK BECAUSE I GUESS I JUST WANTED THERE TO BE ONE IT OPENS UP SPACE EXPLORATION IN SO MANY WAYS OPTIMIZE THE SHIT OUT OF THIS EFFECT AND YOU COULD HAVE A VERY NICE DRIVE NOW WE JUST NEED TO GET CRACKING ON THAT HYPERSPACE DRIVE
I'M SO EXCITED I CAN FINALLY RETURN TO MY HOME PLANET AND ESCAPE HU I MEAN THIS IS GREAT NEWS
HOW DOES THE MEASURED THRUST VARY WITH ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE

THEY TESTED IT AT MICRO TORR AND GOT CONSISTENT RESULTS AT THAT PRESSURE INCREASE THE PRESSURE SLIGHTLY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

MY PREDICTION IS THAT MEASURED THRUST WILL INCREASE AS PRESSURE INCREASES UP TO A PEAK AND THEN IT WILL RAPIDLY DECREASE TO ZERO AS THE AIR BECOMES THICKER

UNTIL THEY ANSWER THIS QUESTION THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION FOR THE OBSERVED THRUST IS MOMENTUM EXCHANGE THROUGH IMPINGEMENT OF HOT SURFACES BY RESIDUAL AIR MOLECULES THIS IS HOW A CROOKES RADIOMETER WORKS

ADMITTEDLY I SKIMMED THROUGH THE PAPER PERHAPS A MORE CAREFUL READING WOULD DISCREDIT THIS HYPOTHESIS
I REMEMBER THIS SUB CLAIMING IT KNEW BETTER THAN ALL THE SCIENTISTS LAST YEAR
THE PAPER DOES NOT SAY THAT IT WORKS IT SAID THERE IS A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL SOURCES OF AN ERROR SOME OF WHICH HAD BEEN RULED OUT WITH SOME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WHILE OTHERS LIKE THERMAL EFFECTS CANNOT BE RULED OUT DIRECTLY AND MAY ONLY BE ASSESSED INDIRECTLY WITH A DODGY CERTAINTY LEVEL

WHICH MEANS KEEP LOOKING THE ERROR IS SOMEWHERE OUT THERE NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT
IF IT REALLY WORKS IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE DARPA STARTS TO LOOK AT HOW TO USE IT AS A WEAPON
IF I UNDERSTAND THINGS CORRECTLY THIS THING HEATS UP QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY IF ONE SIDE HEATS UP MORE THAN THE OTHER IT WOULD EMIT MORE BLACK BODY RADIATION IN THAT DIRECTION WOULDN'T THAT EXPLAIN A THRUST
IF NASA USED SUCH RIGOROUS METHODS TO DETECT SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF THRUST THEN HOW WAS THE INVENTOR IN ABLE TO DETECT IT WAS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THRUST DID HE HAVE HIS CONNECTED TO A SMALL POWER PLANT
SINCE ON PAPER IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO WORK DO YOU KNOW HOW THE INVENTOR CAME UP WITH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
FOR ME THE MOST EXCITING PART ABOUT THIS IS HEY IT WORKS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHY
IMAGINE WHAT INSIGHTS THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS STUMBLED UPON
FINALLY I REMEMBER SEEING THIS YEARS AGO AND REDDIN WAS SHITTING ALL OVER IT IS REDDIN EVER TIRED OF BEING WRONG
WHAT IF THE EM DRIVE DOES WORK BUT DOES NOT WORK ACCORDING TO LAW WOULD THAT REQUIRE A REEVALUATION OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAWS OF PHYSICS OR WOULD WE JUST CONSIDER THIS A VERY RARE EXCEPTION TO THAT LAW
DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHY THIS PAPER ISN'T BEHIND A GRAYWALL I JUST CLICKED ON THE LINK AND VIEWED IT SO REFRESHING
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE AIAA JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER PEER REVIEW DID NOT REQUIRE THAT THIS PAPER DETAIL AND REFERENCE THE TEST HISTORY OF THIS TYPE OF DEVICE THE FACT THAT THE CHINESE MEASURED OF THRUST FOR A KW POWER INPUT IS VERY INTERESTING THIS ARTICLE CLAIMS A THRUST TO POWER OF MN KW YET THE CHINESE RESEARCHERS SEE ABOUT MN KW WHICH IS OVER TIMES HIGHER THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER EXAMPLES OF TEST RESULTS IN THE REFERENCE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED WHETHER THESE DIFFERENCE IS DUE TO A BETTER THRUSTER DESIGN OR A MUCH WORSE MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY SOME DISCUSSION OF THE RANGE OF PERFORMANCE RESULTS WOULD SEEM TO BE NEEDED IN A PEER REVIEWED PAPER THAT IS PROPOSING NEW PHYSICS
WHAT I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT THE EM DRIVE IS THAT WE'VE HAD THE TECH NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM SINCE THE YET WE'VE ONLY NOW DISCOVERED THIS EFFECT ASSUMING IT ACTUALLY WORKS ALL YOU NEED IS A MICROWAVE OVEN AND SOME COPPER MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES WE'VE MISSED
DON'T GET HOW EVERYONE IS BEING SO NEGATIVE ABOUT THE LOW THRUST OUTPUT OF THIS THING ASSUMING IT ACTUALLY WORKS THE NEWCOMEN STEAM ENGINE ORIGINAL PISTON STEAM ENGINE WAS EFFICIENT COMPARED TO THE THE RECORD EFFICIENT STEAM TURBINE WE HAVE TODAY THIS IS PROTOTYPE STAGE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IT MIGHT BE WORKING MUCH LESS ANY IDEA OF WHAT THE UPPER LIMITS OF EFFICIENCY OR THRUST MIGHT BE HOW ABOUT A LITTLE OPTIMISM PEOPLE ALSO EVEN IF WHAT THIS PAPER CLAIMS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS SAYING AN ION THRUSTER IS BETTER BECAUSE IT GETS MORE THRUST WITH THE SAME POWER INPUT IS ASININE IT'S THE ELIMINATION OF THE NEED FOR PROPELLANT REACTION MASS THAT'S THE TRUE HOLY GRAIL
HMM MN KW NOT MUCH BANG FOR YOUR BUCK

BUT THE HALL THRUSTER REQUIRES HEAVY ROCKET FUEL AND THAT EXTRA WEIGHT COULD OFFSET THE HIGHER THRUST THE TEAM CONCLUDES

WHATEVER THE SOURCE OF FUEL YOU STILL NEED IT FOR THAT KW OF ENERGY

A NUMBER OF ERROR SOURCES WERE CONSIDERED AND DISCUSSED

I EXPECT THAT THEY WILL BE DETERMINED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THIS THRUST BY ADVICE IS DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP GUYS
CALLING IT DIELECTROPHORETIC FORCE ON THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT

WON'T WORK IN SPACE UNLESS NEXT TO ANOTHER OBJECT

I HOPE I'M WRONG THOUGH


PLEASE GET RID OF THE MISLEADING HEADLINE IT HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO WORK THAT IS NOT WHAT THE PEER REVIEW ESTABLISHED
OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME WHO DOUBT EDIT INCLUDING ME BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT SCIENCE IS THAT IT WORKS OR DOESN'T I GUESS REGARDLESS OF OUR BELIEFS AS T SAYS

WIKI EMDRIVE
ON THIS TOPIC THERE IS A BBC HORIZON EPISODE CALLED PROJECT GREENLIGHT IT'S QUITE GOOD IF THIS TYPE OF STUFF YOU LOOK IT UP
WELP THAT'S AN ENGINE WITH A SPECIFIC IMPULSE THAT GETS BETTER THE MORE YOU USE IT IT TENDS TOWARDS INFINITY IT HAS INFINITE POTENTIAL AS LONG AS YOU CAN GATHER ENERGY YOU CAN ROW AGAINST THE VACUUM IT'S HUGE WE WILL FINALLY HAVE PROBES THAT CAN GO TO THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM IN MUCH LESS TIME YOU JUST NEED SOME SOLAR PANELS AND THERE YOU HAVE YOUR ENERGY
THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME IS WHAT IS IT PUSHING AND AGAINST WHAT IF THIS DAMN THING WORKS WHY
SOMETHING NOBODY HAS EXPLAINED YET OK SURE LETS SAY THIS WORKS HOW DID SOMEONE CONCEPTUALIZE THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE
WELL COLOR ME DELIGHTED THE DAMN THING ACTUALLY WORKS NOW COME THE PART WHERE WE OPTIMISE THE EFFECT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIGURE WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING FROM THAT PROCESS
I THINK WE CAN RULE OUT MAGNETIC INTERACTION THE OUTPUT POWER KW HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS NOT CONSTANT PERHAPS SCIENTIST IN BRAZIL WHERE THERE'S A WEAKER FIELD COULD RUN THE TESTS AND SEE
I FIND IT BOTH ODD AND INSANE THAT WE CAN SOMEHOW PRODUCE A DRIVE THAT DEFIES PHYSICS AND WORKS AS FAR AS THIS ARTICLE IS CONCERNED YET WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW IT WORKS
I AM A GEEK NOT A SUPER GEEK BUT A GEEK ALL THE SAME THIS BLOWS MY MIND
ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS HOOOOOOOLEEEEEE FUCK I EXPECTED THIS TO BE DEBUNKED RIGHT AWAY NOW WERE IN FOR TEST AFTER TEST THAT MAY UPEND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT PHYSICS I LOVE LIFE FOR THINGS LIKE THIS BORN TOO LATE TO EXPLORE THE WORLD AND BORN TOO EARLY TO EXPLORE SPACE BUT I MAY BE AROUND TO SEE THE DRIVE THAT ENABLES IT
IF THERE'S NO SCIENCE TO BACK IT UP WHAT ON EARTH INSPIRED ROGER SAWYER TO DESIGN SUCH A CONTRAPTION IT SEEMS INCONCEIVABLE TO ME THAT THE CONCEPT HAS MADE IT EVEN THIS FAR IN THE FACE OF SUCH SCRUTINY I DO WISH THE REVIEW PROCESS WASN'T QUITE SO GLACIAL EXCITING
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO MEASURE HUST IN THIS CASE FOR EXAMPLE CAVENDISH MEASURED THE ATTRACTIVE GRAVITATIONAL FORCE BETWEEN LABORATORY OBJECTS BY HAVING THE FORCE TWIST A THREAD HE WAS ABLE TO DO THIS MANY DECADES AGO WITH MUCH CRUDER INSTRUMENTS TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE ENTIRE PHYSICS ESTABLISHMENT PROBABLY WITH ONLY A TINY FRACTION OF THE BUDGET AND RESOURCES

IN ADDITION THE ARTICLE MENTIONS THAT THE THRUST OF A LIGHT SAIL IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE SMALLER THAN THE EM THRUSTER YET LIGHT SAIL THRUST IS ACCEPTED I ALSO DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY LIGHT SAILS HAVE THRUST MEASURED IN UNITS OF N KW WHY DO LIGHT SAILS REQUIRE ENERGY I MEAN THE LIGHT ENERGY IS BEING HARVESTED NOT GENERATED BY THE SAIL RIGHT IT'S NOT A CONSUMABLE LIKE THE FUEL USED TO POWER A MICROWAVE SOURCE OR ARE THEY THINKING OF HARVESTING AMBIENT LIGHT FROM A STAR OR STARS LIKE THE SUN CONVERTING IT TO MICROWAVES POWERING THE EM DRIVE AND THEREBY GENERATING MORE THRUST THAN THE LIGHT SAIL

I NEED AN EM DRIVE TUTORIAL AND A TUTORIAL ON THE DIFFICULTY OF MEASURING ITS THRUST
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF CURIOSITY I CALCULATED WHAT KIND OF VELOCITY AN ENGINE LIKE THIS COULD GENERATE GIVEN OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY I READ AN ARTICLE RECENTLY THAT CHINA HAS DEVELOPED A NUCLEAR REACTOR THAT FITS IN A SHIPPING CONTAINER AND GENERATES MEGAWATTS OF POWER THE ARTICLE DIDN'T MENTION WEIGHT SO I ASSUMED AN AVERAGE DENSITY OF GRAM CC SAME AS WATER THE SIZE OF THE REACTOR IS X X PROVIDING A TOTAL MASS OF ABOUT TONS

SO ASSUME YOU TAKE THIS REACTOR AND STRAP A WEIGHTLESS EM DRIVE TO IT GET IT INTO ORBIT AND THEN FIRE IT UP IT'S NOT GOING TO ACCELERATE VERY QUICKLY

MILLINEWTONS KILOWATT KILOWATTS TONS

M S 2

HOWEVER GIVE IT TEN YEARS TO ACCELERATE

M S 2 YEARS

KM S

OKAY THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET US TO ALPHA CENTAURI BUT IT'S MUCH FASTER THAN ANY OF OUR INTERPLANETARY PROBES BY A FACTOR OF ABOUT AND POTENTIALLY THE REACTOR COULD WORK FOR LONGER THAN YEARS SO IF IT WORKS IT MAKES EXPLORING THE OUTER REACHES OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM MUCH EASIER
DOES THE THRUST HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH INTERACTION WITH MAGNETIC POLES
ANOTHER THING THAT IS LACKING IN THE PAPER IS A DISCUSSION ON TEST RESULTS AROUND THE WORLD OF SIMILAR DEVICES TO ME THE FACT THAT THE CHINESE MEASURED OF THRUST FOR A KW POWER INPUT IS VERY INTERESTING THE AIAA JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER ARTICLE CLAIMS A THRUST TO POWER OF MN KW YET THE CHINESE RESEARCHERS SEE ABOUT MN KW WHICH IS OVER TIMES HIGHER THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER EXAMPLES OF TEST RESULTS IN THE REFERENCE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED WHETHER THESE DIFFERENCE IS DUE TO A BETTER THRUSTER DESIGN OR A MUCH WORSE MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY SOME DISCUSSION OF THE RANGE OF PERFORMANCE RESULTS WOULD SEEM TO BE NEEDED IN A PEER REVIEWED PAPER THAT IS PROPOSING NEW PHYSICS
SO I WANT TO SET ASIDE FOR A MOMENT WHETHER THE RESULTS ARE LEGITIMATE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT FOR WATTS KW OF INPUT POWER THE DEVICE PRODUCES MILLINEWTONS OF THRUST WHICH SEEMS A TINY NUMBER BUT APPARENTLY BEATS SOLAR SAILS SO HEY THE RESULT MAY BREAK OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS BUT NO MATTER IT SOUNDS LIKE I STILL NEED TO POUR A CONTINUOUS W INTO THE EM DRIVE TO GET THAT THRUST

HOW DOES THAT HELP IN SPACE WHERE WOULD THE POWER EVEN COME FROM SO I DON'T NEED HEAVY ROCKET FUEL WHICH IS GOOD BUT STILL NEED SOME SOURCE OF POWER IN A VACUUM NUCLEAR REACTOR
THIS TECHNOLOGY IS LIKE A TRANSISTOR FOR OUR EARTH EXERT GALACTIC SCALE POTENTIAL
THERE'S A LOT OF RIGHTLY SKEPTICAL RESPONSES HERE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THIS IS STILL AN EXCITING DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE EVEN IF WE EVENTUALLY FIND THAT IT'S NOTHING BUT EXPERIMENTAL ERROR OR SOME MUNDANE EXPLANATION THAT INFORMATION STILL HELPS NARROW DOWN THINGS THAT WON'T GET US WHERE WE WANT IN OTHER WORDS FUTURE RESEARCH CAN THEORETICALLY BECOME MORE FOCUSED AND HOPEFULLY FRUITFUL AS A RESULT

PUT ANOTHER WAY EVERYBODY WANTS A MEANS TO TRAVEL INTERSTELLAR DISTANCES IN A SINGLE HUMAN LIFETIME AND EVEN IF THIS DOESN'T WIND UP BEING THE DISCOVERY THAT ALLOWS THAT IT'S STILL A STEP THAT MAY HELP GET US TO THAT GOAL FASTER IF IT MEANS FUTURE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE RUN MORE EFFICIENTLY BECAUSE THEY ACCOUNT FOR WHATEVER MISTAKE OR MUNDANE EFFECT WE LEARN WAS AT PLAY HERE

SCIENCE IS ITERATIVE AND EVEN BAD RESULTS HELP IN THE LONG RUN TO PUT IT SUCCINCTLY
THE ARTICLE READS AS APPROPRIATELY RESTRAINED TO ME THE EM DRIVE IS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY CLAIM THAT ONLY BECAUSE THE TESTING HAS BEEN SO CAREFUL CAN IT BE CONSIDERED AS POSSIBLY VALID PHYSICS HAS NOT HAD A VALIDATED MOMENT LIKE THIS IN ALMOST YEARS DARK MATTER AND DARK ENERGY ARE STILL HIGHLY PROVISIONAL BUT RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS WERE SUCH WORLD CHANGING PARADIGM SHIFTS THAT WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE OPEN MINDED THAN GEOLOGY OR PALEONTOLOGY
I THINK THE THING THAT STILL REALLY NEEDS TO BE PROVED IS THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY SCALES PRODUCING MINISCULE FORCES IN THE LAB IS INTERESTING SEE THE CASIMIR EFFECT BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT WORK COUNTERINTUITIVELY AT SMALL SCALES TO MAKE SOMETHING USEFUL IT STILL NEEDS TO BE PROVED THAT PUMPING KILOWATTS OF POWER IN ACTUALLY DOES PRODUCE MILLINEWTONS OF THRUST
DOES IT ACTUALLY BREAK THE LAWS OF PHYSICS OR HAVE THEY NOT FIGURED OUT YET HOW IT WORKS WITHOUT BREAKING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
GUYS I'M RUSSIAN PHYSICIST AND ALL THIS EXCITEMENT ABOUT EMDRIVE IS ONE HUGE MISTAKE IT JUST CAN'T WORK AS DESCRIBED AND IT WON'T WORK IN SPACE OF COURSE I DON'T THINK HAROLD WHITE MADE FAKE RESEARCH BUT I'M SURE THAT THIS PROPULSION HAS SOME OTHER REASONS ALMOST ALL THE SCIENTISTS ARE VERY SCEPTICAL ABOUT THIS
OK I'LL SAY IT

THEY MEASURED THRUST BUT THE THRUST THEY MEASURED WAS CLOSE TO THEIR MARGIN OF ERROR MEANING IT IS NOT AS LIKELY TO HAVE MEASURED REAL THRUST

THE EM DRIVE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CLAIM AND EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS NEED EXTRAORDINARY EVIDENCE WHICH THIS ISN'T IT WILL BE PUBLISHED BECAUSE IT IS A SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO EXAMINING THIS CLAIM BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WORKS

I'LL START BY DOWNVOTING MYSELF
THIS IS JUST SENSATIONALIST AIAA STILL HAS TO OFFICIALLY PUBLISH THIS NOT A LEAK BEING TRUMPETED AROUND BY SCIENCEALERT WHICH BY ITSELF DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING REALLY AND THE CANNAE DRIVE IS BEING PUSHED INTO SPACE ON A CUBE SAT BY GUIDO BETTA OF CANNAE INC NOT NASA WITH NO NEWS FROM THAT EITHER

SO NO FOR NOW IT'S NOT PUBLISHED MAYBE IT WILL IN DECEMEMBER NOR DOES IT WORK

I FOR ONE WILL BELIEVE ANY OF THIS PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC HOGWASH WHEN IT COMES FROM OFFICIAL MAINLINE SOURCES WITH HARD TESTS IN THE FIELD NOT PEDDLING BY A SITE FOR CLICKS
R TITLEGORE

IT'S NOT TRUE

SOME PEER SCIENTISTS DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH THE METHODOLOGY AND CONCLUSIONS

THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S TRUE IT CAN ALL BE PERFECTLY WRONG IT'S JUST SOME PEOPLE DOESN'T SEE WHY
I'VE STILL SEEN NO EVEN REMOTELY PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT THAT A RELATIONLESS DRIVE WOULD NOT ON THE HAPPY SIDE RESULT IN A MACHINE PUT IT ON A STICK SPINNING AROUND A DYNAMO WITH WIRES GOING FROM THE MIDDLE TO THE RIM FASTER AND FASTER AND FASTER HERE COMES THE BERTH EFFECT YAY INFINITE ENERGY OR OF COURSE INEXPENSIVE

ALSO IF IT'S REVERSIBLE IN THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WHERE IT GIVES YOU A RELATIONLESS ACCELERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR POWER BUT CAN ALSO GIVE YOU POWER IN EXCHANGE FOR AN ACCELERATION CAN'T YOU JUST SIT IT ON THE GROUND AND GET POWER FROM IT FOR FREE

NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE ALL OF PHYSICS WITH ALL OF ITS VERIFIED EXPERIMENTS WOULD HAVE TO BE TORN DOWN AND SOMEHOW RECONSTRUCTED WITH ALL OF THOSE EXPERIMENTS WORKING OUT THE SAME WAY FOR THIS TO BE A THING

WORKABLE FUSION POWER PLANTS THAT I CAN BELIEVE RELATIONLESS DRIVES THOUGH

IF THEY WORK IT'S A DISASTER FOR SCIENCE AND ALSO FOR THE HUMAN RACE AS SOON AS SOMEONE SENDS A BRICK WITH AN RTG OR SOMETHING POWERING THE RELATIONLESS DRIVE ON IT OUT AND OUT AND OUT AND THEN IT TURNS AROUND AND COMES BACK AND BACK AND BACK
THIS IS POTENTIALLY THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DISCOVERY OF MAN THAT WE ARE WITNESSING

IF THIS WORKS IT HAS UNENDING IMPLICATIONS IN PHYSICS AND TRAVEL INCLUDING ENERGY THIS COULD FUNDAMENTALLY SHAKE THE HUMAN FUTURE IF IT WORKS MAYBE
IF THE UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATION THEN THIS SEEMS LIKE THE FIRST MAJOR EXPLOIT FOUND IN THE CODE SPEEDRUNNERS WILL HAVE A FIELD DAY SHAVING SECONDS OFF OF THEIR RUNS
I FEEL LIKE THIS THING IS GOING TO ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN THE REAL OF QUANTUM PHYSICS WHERE WE SAY OH THE RULES BREAK DOWN HERE BECAUSE OF THE FORCES INVOLVED IN EM DRIVE JUST A HUNCH BUT THAT'S MY HUNCH
AT LAST IT MADE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE NOW THERE CAN BE SOME MEANINGFUL DEBATE ABOUT THIS IT'S BEEN ALMOST 2 WEEKS THAT THE ARTICLE WAS LEAKED

I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE WHERE THIS LEADS US THIS EXPERIMENT IS ALREADY A REPRODUCTION OF OTHERS RESULTS SEE WEBSITE ALBEIT UNPUBLISHED RESULTS I HOPE THAT SOME OTHER PUBLIC RESEARCH TEAM LOOK INTO IT AND TRY TO REPRODUCE THE PHENOMENON AGAIN AND AGAIN ESPECIALLY IN ORBIT IF THIS WORKS WE MAY HAVE UNLOCKED ONE OF THE KEYS TO INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL WE MAY EVEN DISCOVER A NEW PHYSICS

LET'S SEE HOW IT WILL GO
PHYSICISTS ARE ALWAYS SAYING THINGS LIKE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET BUT WE DO KNOW THIS CANNOT WORK
R PHYSICS MODS SOUND LIKE THE KIND OF SCIENTIST THAT DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT ANY DIFFERENT THEORY THEN THE ONE THEY BELIEVE IN EVEN IF THAT MEANS ABUSING HEIR POWER TO SILENCE THE OPPOSITION

SOME THINGS DON'T CHANGE
I'M STILL NOT BUYING IT TO BE HONEST I PROBABLY NEVER WILLIAM I HAVE A VERY HARD TIME WITH THE FACT THAT SOMEONE BUILT THIS THING WITHOUT KNOWING HOW IT WORKED AND SEEMINGLY WITH A VERY FLAWED UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS AS A WHOLE AND JUST HAPPENED TO CREATE A MACHINE THAT VIOLATES KNOWN BASIC LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE IT SEEMS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO ME THAT THERE'S SOME UNACCOUNTED FOR VARIABLE NOBODY HAS THOUGHT OF YET

OR TO EXPLAIN IT AGAIN HE SET OUT TO BREAK THE LAWS OF PHYSICS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEM THEN DID WHEN SOMEONE EXPLAINED THAT HIS UNDERSTANDING WAS WRONG HE AGREED SHRUGGED AND SAID YEAH BUT IT WORKS

I COULD WALK INTO A LAB TOMORROW WITH A WOODEN DOOR AND CLAIM THAT I'D DISCOVERED BURNING IT COULD VIOLATE PHYSICS BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THE COMPLEXITY OF THE EXPERIMENT MIGHT TAKE DECADES TO PROVE ME WRONG EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE KNOWS I AM
IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE LEGIT WE CAN ADD DEFIED SOME OF THE KNOWN FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF PHYSICS TO THE LIST OF CRAZY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN

EDIT FOUND THE CYNICAL PHYCISIST
WHAT PEOPLE FORGET TO MENTION IS THAT THE ENGINE DESIGN IS VERY VERY SIMPLE COMPARED TO A CONVENTIONAL ROCKET IS ALMOST COMPARING A BICYCLE WITH A TESLA THIS ENGINE IF PROVEN TRUE WILL OPEN UP THE GALAXY FOR US HUMANS WE NEED MORE RESEARCH THOUGH AND A TEST IN SPACE
I'M KINDA EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO GET TO ALPHA PROXIMA CENTAURI IN YEARS WITH A SUPERCONDUCTING VERSION OF THE EMDRIVE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE IS PLANET IN THE HABITABLE ZONE AROUND PROXIMA CENTAURI

IN ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK TO LAUNCH NEW HORIZONS FROM EARTH AND DO A FLYBY OF PLUTO WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO LAUNCH A PROBE WITH AN EMDRIVE TOWARDS PROXIMA CENTAURI B AND POSSIBLY FIND NEW LIFE THERE
ONE THING THAT IS HARD TO SWALLOW THE GUY WHO INVENTED DIDN'T EXPLAIN IT WHY HE CLAIM HE DOES BUT HIS PAPERS WEREN'T PEER REVIEWED AND I DON'T TRUST THAT SORRY UNIVERSITY MADE ME THAT WAY AND WITH OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE EVEN WE CURRENTLY DON'T KNOW WHY

THIS IS VERY COUNTER INTUITIVE BASED ON EVERY OTHER INVENTION OUR SPECIES HAD FIRST WE DISCOVER THE PRINCIPLE THEN PEOPLE THAT ARE MORE OR LESS COMFORTABLE WITH IT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU TURN A TO B AND MAKE A INVENTION THAT USES THESE PRINCIPLES

IT IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO ACCEPT THAT ONE GUY CONVERTED NON PRINCIPLES TO PRACTICALITY

HOW CAN SOMEONE INVENT THE TELEVISION BEFORE THE ELECTRICITY

IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO PEOPLE WHO INVENT PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINES THEY DON'T KNOW THE PRINCIPLES JUST HAVE A GENERAL IDEA THAT THEY THINK IS RELEVANT ALTHOUGH IT ISN'T

EDIT IT SEEMS THAT I WAS WRONG I'LL KEEP THIS COMMENT THOUGH SINCE IT GENERATED A DISCUSSION BELOW
FOLLOWING THIS THROUGH IN MY HEAD I THINK THE WEIRDEST PART IS THAT IT IS SO SELF CONTAINED AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THEY COULD TAKE IT UP TO THE ISS AND AS LONG AS IT'S BOLTED DOWN TO SOMETHING AND POWERED IT COULD POTENTIALLY MOVE THE SPACE STATION THEY DON'T NEED TO MAKE A HOLE AND POINT IT OUT THE BACK OF THE ISS IT JUST KINDA WORKS IF THEY WANT TO GO IN ANOTHER DIRECTION JUST TURN THE DRIVE AROUND IT'S VERY UNINTUITIVE AND BIZARRE IN ITS PERFECTNESS I REALLY HOPE IT WORKS AND IF IT DOES IT IS GOING TO BE ASTRONOMICALLY GAME CHANGING ONCE THE INEVITABLE RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED TO IMPROVING IT AND MAKING IT MORE EFFICIENT
SO WHAT IS THE FUEL IT BOUNCES MICROWAVES AROUND IN A CONE TO GENERATE THRUST AT MILLINEWTONS PER KILOWATT BUT HOW ARE THESE KILOWATTS BEING PRODUCED DOES IT JUST NEED THE INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE MICROWAVES AND THEY JUST BOUNCE INDEFINITELY FROM THERE

PLEASE EXCUSE MY IGNORANCE IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE I'VE HAD ANY FORMAL EDUCATION ON PHYSICS
I NOTE THAT THEY ONLY DID SOMETHING LIKE RUNS ALL UP AND THEY DIDN'T LAST VERY LONG
COULD THIS BE SITUATED INSIDE THE SPACE CRAFT ALLOWING FOR MAINTENANCE IS NEEDED I'M ASSUMING THE MICROWAVES ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THE CONICAL VESSEL SO THIS SHOULD BE SAFE TO BE AROUND WHILST IN USE YES HOW BIG WOULD ONE HAVE TO BE TO HOLD THE ISS IN ITS ORBIT
ISN'T THIS A REALLY BIG DEAL I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS THAT PROPULSION SYSTEM THAT CREATES PUSH WITHOUT DOING SHIT WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS NONSENSE OR SOMETHING FREE ENERGY
AS A CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME IF THIS FORCE MEASURED IN A VACUUM WOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PUSH AGAINST GRAVITY

COULD IT FOR EXAMPLE PROPEL AN ADULT HUMAN

OK OVERBOARD THERE I SAID IT DO WE GET HOVERBOARDS OR WHAT LET'S BE HONEST IT'S ALL WE REALLY CARE ABOUT

I KNOW THIS ISN'T THINKING BIG BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE TRAVEL TO THE MOON INCREDIBLY QUICK AND EFFICIENT THINK ABOUT LAUNCHING SEVERAL HUNDRED TONS OF PAYLOADS INTO SPACE WITH CONVENTIONAL ROCKETS AND THEN SOMEWHAT LASSOING THEM TOGETHER AND HAVING AN EM DRIVE DO THE WORK OF TRANSPORTING THEM TO A PERMANENT MOON BASE WHERE CONSTRUCTION CAN BE DONE IN ORBIT OF THE FIRST OFFICIAL STARSHIP FOR HUMANITY

GRANTED THIS SOUNDS ALL AND IT'S NOT PROVEN YET NOR DO WE HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THE INERTIA PROBLEM THAT'S BOUND TO HAPPEN EVEN AT GRADUAL INCREASES IN SPEED BUT IT IS A GIANT SKIP LEAP AND JUMP FOR MANKIND ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STAGNATION PERIOD POST MOON LANDING UNMANNED EXPLORATION ASIDE OF COURSE

I THINK WE ARE STILL MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS FROM SOLVING THE DIFFICULTY OF HAVING LARGE PAYLOADS ACHIEVE ESCAPE VELOCITY ON EARTH AND OBVIOUSLY SHIELDING OF SORTS FOR MICROMETEORITE ETC THEN THERES THE GRAVITY PROBLEM AND INERTIAL DAMPENING PROBLEM BUT THEY ARE JUST A MATTER OF TIME ONCE WE MASTER CONSTRUCTION IN A LOW G OR MICRO G ENVIRONMENT WE COULD SEND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OUT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME FOR STUDY AND RESEARCH IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND AS A FAN OF AGU AND SOMEONE WHO WOULD HAVE CUT OFF A NON-ESSENTIAL BODY PART TO BE ON A SHIP LIKE DESTINY THIS HAS ME RATHER EXCITED

ROOM TEMP SUPERCONDUCTIVITY OR FUSION WOULD PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY LIMITLESS ENERGY FOR THE EM DRIVE THE NEW WORKHORSE OF INTER PLANETARY AND INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL

AH DON'T WE LIVE IN EXCITING TIMES
COMPUTERS PEOPLE STILL DON'T TRUST THEM OR THE K THERE HIGH TECH LISTENING DEVICES PLACED BY THE GOVERNMENT
NOT SURE THAT'S THE MOST REPUTABLE WEBSITE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE MISSING A LOT OF KEY ISSUES REGARDING SCIENTIFIC TESTING ETC BUT IT SOUNDS EXCITING
DON'T YOU MEAN THEY DON'T CHECK SOUNDNESS THEY JUST CHECK METHODOLOGICAL VALIDITY
PEER REVIEW IS A GOOD STEP THE NEXT TEST IS SOMEONE HAVING ENOUGH FAITH TO PONY UP SOME MONEY TO BUILD ONE ONCE ONE IS BUILT AND WE GET SOME FIELD TEST DATA
ITS FLAWED DARN THOUGHT WE WERE GETTING CLOSE TO MAKING GRANDAMS
IT'S CRESTING THRUST AND PEOPLE KNOW THAT ALREADY RIGHT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT IF IT'S CREATING THRUST THAN IT DOES INDEED WORK PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK IT'S A MAGIC TRICK OR SOMETHING
GODDAMN I MEAN I KNOW THERE'S A SHIT TON OF TESTING AND PROTOTYPING THEY STILL NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO TRY AND DEPLOY ONE IN SPACE AND SEE IF IT WORKS IN ORBIT BUT HAVING SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE HAPPEN JUST LESS THAN 2 WEEKS AFTER DONALD TRUMP GOT ELECTED MY HEAD IS SWOONING
I HOPE THEY PLAY SUGAR RAY I JUST WANT TO FLY WHEN THEY LAUNCH ONE OF THESE
CHINESE HAS BEEN CLAIMING THEY PROVED ROGER DRIVE SINCE FOR SOME REASON IT TOOK NASA TILL TO TAKE NOTICE


WHY ARE PEOPLE DOUBTING THE EM DRIVE SO MUCH IT'S HAD PROMISING TESTS IF THERE WAS ONE THING TO DOUBT AND LABEL AS IMPOSSIBLE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LEAD SCIENTIST CONTRIBUTION TO THE SENSATIONALISM THAT IS DRIVE A PREMISE PARTING FROM THE MADE UP PHYSICS OF EXOTIC NEGATIVE ENERGY DENSITY IT'S LIKE TRYING TO SOLVE A MAZE PUZZLE ADDING AS PART OF THE SOLUTION THE PREMISE THAT YOU CAN SKIP A WALL OR TWO MAYBE IT'S A SOLUTION TO THE NEW RULES YOU'VE MADE UP BUT IT'S NOT IN ANY WAY A SOLUTION WITHIN THE CONSTRAINTS OF SAID PUZZLE IN THE FIRST PLACE
SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY THING TO DO NOW TO PROVE IF THIS THING WORKS OR NOT IS JUST MAKE ONE AND SEND IT TO SPACE AND FIRE IT UP I KNOW IT'S AN EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR BUT THERE HAS TO BE A LIGHT PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT COULD BE TESTED RIGHT THINKING JUST A BATTERY ENGINE AND RADIO AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS OF COURSE WE'D PROBABLY STRAP TWO MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SENSORS ON IT BECAUSE SCIENCE BUT STILL
PEOPLE NEED TO STOP USING THE WORD IMPOSSIBLE NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE ONLY IMPROBABLE

HAVING READ BUT ONLY PARTLY UNDERSTOOD THE PAPER CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THEY HAVE CONTROLLED FOR MAGNETIC EFFECTS I EAST WHETHER THE THRUST COULD BE DUE TO AN INTERACTION WITH THE MAGNETIC FIELD
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHICH DIRECTION IT SUPPOSEDLY PRODUCES THRUST IN
IT OBVIOUSLY LOOKS LIKE A ROCKET NOZZLE BUT MAYBE IT'S COUNTER INTUITIVE
I SAW THAT THING ONCE
IF NOT THAT SAME DEVICE THEN ONE JUST LIKE IT
IT IS AT NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER IN THE LOBBY OF A BUILDING THEY USE FOR TRAINING AND ORIENTATION
I WORK FOR A FEDERAL FACILITIES CONTRACTOR MY BOSS AND I STOOD THERE AND STARED AT IT FOR FIVE MINUTES
I EXPLAINED WHAT IT WAS AS BEST I COULD BUT I DON'T THINK HE REALLY GOT MUCH HE'S A BUSINESSMAN NOT A NERD THAT'S WHY I WORK FOR HIM
GREAT MAKES ME WONDER WHAT OTHER UNDISCOVERED MECHANISMS THERE ARE FOR CONVERTING ENERGY DIRECTLY INTO DESIRABLE PHYSICS WE SHOULD START THINKING ABOUT HOW TO STORE AND USE THE EXCESS ENERGY WE CAPTURE FROM SPACE SINCE IT SEEMS WE WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD OURSELVES BACK WE COULD USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO STABILIZE THE ORBIT OR EVEN PILOT THE ENTIRE PLANET IT'S AS THOUGH WE HAVE JUST GAINED TRACTION IN SPACE FOR THE FIRST TIME VERY EXCITING
IF IT'S SUCH A MYSTERY AND HARD TO CORRECTLY TEST CAN'T THEY JUST FIELD TEST IT IN SPACE
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT IF THIS TURNS OUT TO BE FOR REAL WILL WE SEE SPACESHIPS TAKE OFF INTO SPACE WITHOUT THOSE LOUD HUGE ROCKETS THEY USE TODAY FOR THRUST LIKE WILL IT JUST BE A HUGE CYLINDER THAT LEVITATES QUIETLY UP INTO THE AIR RAPIDLY

PRETTY DOPE
QUICK SILLY QUESTION SAY THE DRIVE WORKS AND WE CAN USE IT FOR SPACE TRAVEL

THE POWER SOURCE WOULD LIKELY BE SOLAR STRAP SOME BIG ASS PANELS GET THE POWER TO HAVE ACCELERATION BUT AS WE GET FURTHER FROM THE SUN THE POWER WE GET IS LOWERED THIS MEANS THAT BY THE TIME WE HAVE REACHED MARS SUN POWER WOULD BE OF WHAT WE HAVE AT DEPARTURE

HOW DO WE SLOW DOWN WITH THE POWER DOES IT MEAN WE NEED TO START SLOWING DOWN AFTER OF THE TRIP
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM IT DEFIES THIRD LAW WHICH STATES THAT EVERYTHING MUST HAVE AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION

WHENEVER YOU SEE THIS IN AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE EM DRIVE YOU CAN BE CERTAIN THE WRITER DOESN'T KNOW SHIT AND IS JUST REPEATING WHAT OTHER WRITERS PUT IN THEIR ARTICLES
A VACUUM TEST CAMPAIGN EVALUATING THE IMPULSIVE THRUST PERFORMANCE OF A TAPERED RADIO-FREQUENCY TEST ARTICLE EXCITED IN THE TRANSVERSE MAGNITUDE MODE AT MHZ HAS BEEN COMPLETED

SHOULDN'T THIS BE TRANSVERSE MAGNETIC AND NOT TRANSVERSE MAGNITUDE IE TM MODE I'M AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER BUT IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE DEALT WITH RF
CAN'T THEY BUILD A SMALL SCALE ENGINE AND SIMPLY LAUNCH IT IN SPACE AND JUST TRY IT THERE

ISAAC ASIMOV THE LAST QUESTION I BELIEVE OP IS QUOTING THE LAST QUESTION BY ISAAC ASIMOV
PEER REVIEW AND GOLDEN CHOPSTICKS SIXTY SYMBOLS THEN THERE ARE ATROCITIES LIKE THIS
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
I'M SO CONFUSED CAN SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME

WHAT IS AN EM DRIVE

2 HOW FAST WOULD BE ABLE TO TRAVEL WITH IT COMPARED TO STANDARD ROCKETS

DOES IT WORK
I'M WONDERING WHETHER THIS EM DRIVE HAS GOTTEN PAST SIGNIFICANT HURDLES OR IF IT JUST SEEMS THAT WAY DUE TO THE REDDIN BUBBLE IN WHICH I ALWAYS ENCOUNTER IT IS IT CONSIDERED A BIG DEAL YET OR IS IT MEETING A GREAT DEAL OF SKEPTICISM OUT IN THE REAL WORLD YES I REALIZE THE IRONY OF ASKING THAT QUESTION ON REDDIN
I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THRUST AND IT'S CONSTITUENT VARIABLES BUT ISN'T MN AN INCREDIBLY SMALL AMOUNT OF FORCE TO BE EXERTED PER KILOWATT CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THIS A LITTLE MORE IN DETAIL ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND IT IS A REMARKABLE OBSERVATION SINCE THERE IS NO FUEL BEING BURNT IN THE PROCESS
SO THIS WAS JUST THEORETICALLY THOUGHT UP AND THEN AFTER TESTING IT IT WORKED

ISN'T IT NORMALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND AND WHO THOUGHT THIS UP
I LOVE ALL THIS EM DRIVE STUFF IT'S EXCITING

YET I LITERALLY UNDERSTAND NOTHING ABOUT IT I THINK THAT MAKES ME JUST AS QUALIFIED AS ANYONE ELSE LOL

SO LIKE IF THIS IS A THING LIKE AN ACTUAL THING NOW WHERE THE FUCK DID IT COME FROM WE DUNNO WHAT IT CAN DO OR HOW IT WORKS FAIR ENOUGH BUT IT DIDN'T JUST TURN UP IN AN ENGINEERS LAB ONE DAY
SO WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS DEVICE DO IT IS EXCITING PARTICLES AND DIRECTING THEM TO A SPECIFIC VECTOR
WHY AREN'T NASA AND OR JOHNSON SPACE CENTER PRESS OFFICERS PROMOTING THIS WHO IS FUNDING IT
THIS IS COMPLETELY USELESS UNTIL IT'S ACTUALLY TESTED IN SPACE THE NUMBERS ARE SO SMALL THAT I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY TEST IT ON GROUND
TOTALLY OFF TOPIC BUT THE FACT IT SAYS IT INSTEAD OF IT IS TELLING OF OP
ALSO POSTING SPACE NEWS
SO LOOKS LIKE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN AETHER IS NOT YET OUT OF THE QUESTION AS MANY SCIENTIST HAVE WANTED TO MAKE US BELIEVE
AS FAR AS MY RUDIMENTARY UNDERSTANDING GOES MASS AND ENERGY ARE INTERCHANGEABLE TO AN EXTENT THAT'S HOW NUCLEAR BOMBS WORK RIGHT IF ELECTRICITY IS USED IN THIS PROPULSION SYSTEM WOULDN'T THE EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE OF SOME EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF MASS THEREFORE MAKING IT NOT AND NOT IMPOSSIBLE
I'VE BEEN READING THESE COMMENTS FOR ABOUT MINUTES NOW REDDIN QUICKLY TURNED INTO A PHYSICS CLASS WITH ROCKET SCIENTISTS EVERYWHERE
I'M NOT ABLE TO ACCESS IT ON PHONE DOES ANYONE KNOW WHETHER THEY TESTED IT YET WITH ANOTHER SORT OR RADIATION THAN MICROWAVE IF NOT WHY NOT
I WAS READING THE DISCUSSION SECTION OF THE ARTICLE AND IT WAS PROPOSING THAT THE THRUSTER IS PUSHING OFF QUANTUM VACUUM FLUCTUATIONS HYPOTHETICALLY THIS WOULD BE GENERATING A VOLUMETRIC BODY FORCE AND MOVEMENT IN ONE DIRECTION AND A WAKE IN THE QUANTUM VACUUM MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

CAN ANYONE ON HERE PROVIDE MORE DETAIL THAN WHAT'S GIVEN IN THE PAPER FOR THEORY AND HOW IT'S LINKED TO THE POSSIBILITY OF THE VACUUM ACTING AS A DYNAMIC MEDIUM

DISCLAIMER I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS ALL HYPOTHESIS AND THAT VON NEUMANN AND OTHERS PUBLISHED IMPOSSIBILITY PROOFS AGAINST THEORY HALF A CENTURY AGO
OKAY WHY IS R SPACE MORE SKEPTICAL AND REASONABLE THAN R SCIENCE R SCIENCE IS ALL QUANTUM VACUUM STATE PILOT WAVE PHENOMENA OR QUANTUM VIRTUAL PARTICLES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE ARE WAYS TO UNDERSTAND AND DO THE MATH AND NOT PHYSICAL PHENOMENA HOW YOU IMAGINE IT ON THE MACRO SCALE
THE PIC LOOKS FAKE IT'S A FUNNEL-SHAPED COPPER SHEETING BOLTED WITH LOCAL HARDWARE FASTENERS
AMAZING THAT THE PHYSICS SEEMS TO WORK OUT SO THAT DISPLACEMENT DUE TO THE ALLEGED RELATIONLESS FORCE IS THE SAME MAGNITUDE AS THE OPERATION INDUCED DRIFT MISSING FROM THE PAPER IS ANY INDICATION THAT THE DEVICE WILL BE INDEPENDENTLY TESTED BY NATIONAL EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF LOW THRUST ELECTRIC PROPULSION DEVICES EAST G NASA GLENN ELECTRIC PROPULSION LABORATORY THE DISCUSSION VAGUELY DESCRIBES A PHYSICAL MODEL FOR THE DEVICE'S OPERATION AND THEN FAILS TO DISCUSS A THEORETICAL QUANTIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED FORCE OR FUNDAMENTAL VALIDATION TESTS WITHOUT SOME MATH BEHIND IT THROWING THE PILOT WAVE BELL INEQUALITY REFERENCES INTO THE PAPER DOESN'T DO MUCH MORE THAN SAY THAT WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND PHYSICS SO IF WE HAVE A MEASUREMENT WE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT MIGHT BE NEW PHYSICS
I'M NO SCIENTIST BUT IN MY FEEBLE MIND BUT THEY ARE SAYING IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT IT WORKS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T PUSH ANYTHING OUT WHICH VIOLATES NEWTONS 3RD LAW BUT IF IT IS USING EM TO PROPEL ISN'T IT WORKING LIKE A MAGNET A MAGNET DOESN'T PUSH ANYTHING OUT BUT CAN BE USED TO PROPEL THINGS BY ALL MEANS TELL ME I'M WRONG AND IGNORANT BUT IT MAKES SENSE IN MY HEAD
THIS IF IT PANS OUT WOULD LITERALLY RADICALIZE MODERN SPACE TRAVEL AND HUMAN COLONIZATION EFFORTS IMAGINE IT NOT LIVING IN SOME RANDOM SHIT TIME ON EARTH BUT AT THE GREAT COLONIZATION DAWN OF HUMANITY INTO SCI FI OK NOW I'LL BE REALISTIC AND SAY THIS PROBABLY WON'T COME TO FRUITION BUT STILL I KNOW YOU ALL FEEL IT DEEP DOWN IF YOUR BALLS AND LADY BALLS


EDIT LANGUAGE
THE LAWS OF PHYSICS BEING WHAT THEY ARE I WOULDN'T HOLD MY BREATH ON THIS ONE
IT'S OFFICIAL EM DRIVE PAPER HAS FINALLY BEEN PUBLISHED AND IT WORKS
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT CONFRONTED BY A POSSIBLE PARADOX WHICH SUGGESTS THE SCIENTIFIC BELIEF SYSTEM IS ALSO NOTHING MORE THAN YET ANOTHER HUMAN CONSTRUCT FUNDS WILL BEGIN TO FLOW INTO THE INVESTIGATION OF THAT EQUALLY PREPOSTEROUS CONCEPT COLD FUSION

THE RICH RULING CLASS HAS TO FIND A VIABLE WAY TO ESCAPE DOOMED EARTH
NOW CAN WE SLAP THIS ON A JETPACK NOW OR IS IT THAT'S NO MOON SIZE
I'M NO SCIENTIST BUT I RECKON THIS DUDE JUST INVENTED THE PROPULSION SYSTEM FOR THE MTTF OVERBOARD EDIT BASED ON INVENTORS COMMENTS ON ITS POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS NOT THIS ARTICLE
SAD THING IS WHEN I SEE A HEADLINE LIKE THIS I GO TO THE COMMENTS FIRST TO SEE WHY IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T WORK
AND IT WORKS

OKAY I THINK IT'S TIME I QUIT USING REDDIN MISINFORMATION DISINFORMATION IGNORANCE WE HAVE THEN IN ABUNDANCE I REMEMBER WHEN REDDIN USED TO BE THE FIRST PLACE TO GO FOR NEWS AND TECHNOLOGY NOW IT IS QUICKLY BECOMING THE LAST PLACE TO GO FOR CONTENTION
THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY IS ALSO NOTORIOUSLY UNCONVINCED ABOUT THE PROPULSION SYSTEM JUST YESTERDAY A MOTHERBOARD ARTICLE ON THE EM DRIVE WAS DELETED BY THE MODERATORS OF THE POPULAR SUBREDDIT R PHYSICS BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER THE EM DRIVE TO BE UNSCIENTIFIC

ITS NOT SCIENTIFIC WTF REDDIN
SAW HEADLINE TOLD MY WIFE TO PACK HER BAGS WERE GOING TO MARS OPEN THREAD SEE EVERYONE QUESTIONS ARTICLE TIME TO UNPACK BAGS
WHEN I SEE IT VIOLATES THE INSERT NUMBER LAW OF INSERT NAME I ALWAYS WONDER WHY NO ONE IS EVEN CONSIDERING THAT THE LAW MAY BE WRONG


IS THERE A REASON FOR THIS
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE SAID THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION HERE ABOUT HOW A PROPULSION SYSTEM CAN GENERATE THRUST EVERYONE FIRST SAYS THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE IS NO MASS EJECTED FROM ANY ORIFICE ON THE EM DRIVE WELL THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IF YOU CONDUCT A CONTROL VOLUME ANALYSIS HOW ONE ACTUALLY DERIVES THE ROCKET THRUST EQUATION ON THIS SYSTEM YOU WILL FIND THAT THE REACTION FORCE ON THE CONTROL VOLUME WHICH IS EQUAL AND OPPOSITE ON THE EM CAVITY IS A SUMMATION OF THE TIME RATE OF CHANGE OF MOMENTUM WITHIN THE CONTROL VOLUME EM CAVITY PLUS THE NET MOMENTUM FLUX THROUGH THE CONTROL SURFACES OF THE CONTROL VOLUME OBVIOUSLY SINCE THE EM CAVITY IS A CLOSED SYSTEM THERE IS NO MOMENTUM FLUX THROUGH THE CONTROL SURFACES SURROUNDING THE CAVITY AND THE NET MOMENTUM FLUX THROUGH THE CONTROL SURFACES IS ZERO BUT EVERYONE FORGETS THE FULL LINEAR MOMENTUM EQUATION ALSO CONTAINS AN UNSTEADY MOMENTUM TERM HENCE WITHOUT BREAKING NEWTONIAN PHYSICS AND FOR A REAL PHYSICAL NET FORCE TO BE MEASURED THERE MUST BE AN UNSTEADY MOMENTUM COMPONENT WITHIN THE CAVITY AN EXAMPLE OF THIS THRUST COMPONENT CAN BE OBSERVED WHEN SHOOTING A RIFLE FROM HIGH SPEED VIDEOS OF SOMEONE SHOOTING A RIFLE YOU WILL NOTICE THE RIFLE IS PLOWING INTO THEIR SHOULDER PRIOR TO ANYTHING LEAVING THE BARREL OF THE RIFLE THAT FORCE IS GENERATED BY THE UNSTEADY MOMENTUM WITHIN THE RIFLE THE FORCE THAT COMES AFTER THAT IS THE EXHAUST PRODUCTS OF COMBUSTION LEAVING THE BARREL WHICH IS THEN MOMENTUM FLUX AND THE THRUST WE OBSERVE WITH ROCKETS
IT WAS NEVER AND NO THIS IS STILL NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SAY IT WORKS
DELETED
AWESOME IT WOULD BE SO FREAKING FUNNY IF A MARS BASE WAS BUILT UNDER TRUMP BECAUSE OF THIS IMAGINE THE SALT
DELETED
WHY IS THIS GARBAGE BEING UNVOTED IT'S NOT ACTUALLY PEER REVIEWED BY PHYSICISTS AND IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THEIR EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY IS DEEPLY FLAWED IT'S AN OUTRIGHT SCAM AT THIS POINT


FOR ME THE MOST EXCITING PART ABOUT THIS IS HEY IT WORKS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHY
IMAGINE WHAT INSIGHTS THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS STUMBLED UPON
FOR ME THE MOST EXCITING PART ABOUT THIS IS HEY IT WORKS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHY
IMAGINE WHAT INSIGHTS THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS STUMBLED UPON
IT'S WORKING IT'S WORKING
HERE IS A VIDEO DEMONSTRATING IT IN YOU SEE IT START TO MOVE INTO THE VIDEO
COULDN'T THIS BE TESTED BY JUST PUTTING THE EM DRIVE ON WHEELS

I MEAN I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHAT IS DIFFICULT TO TEST HERE I GUESS
QUESTION IF THIS REQUIRES NO PROPELLANT AND ASSUMING THAT IT HAS A POWER SOURCE THAT COULD LAST LONG ENOUGH COULD THIS ENGINE REACH THE SPEED OF LIGHT

IE AT A FORCE OF MN KE OVER YEARS SPEED OF LIGHT
I THOUGHT THEY ALREADY TOOK THIS INTO SPACE TESTED IT AND IT WORKED

NO
NASA JUST SPENT BILLIONS TO CREATE A SOLAR VANE AND THE SAME PEOPLE GUSHING OVER THIS OUT OF VAINGLORIOUS CONCEIT ARE THE SAME ONES CRITICIZING THE IDEA THAT PUBLIC SPENDING ON SCIENCE SHOULD BE CUT

THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT

THIS COMMENT WILL NOW BE DELETED BY FASCISTS BUT I AM STILL RIGHT
UH OH SOMEONE EXPRESSED A POSITIVE OPINION OF SOMEONE ON THE RIGHT THAT'S A NO NO HERE IN R SPACE NOW WILL SOMEONE POINT ME TO THE NEAREST ELON MUSK FERTILITY IDOL IN NEED OF FELLATING
I'VE HEARD WORSE IDEAS COME TO THINK OF IT I'M NOT SURE I ACTUALLY HAVE
OPINION NEWT GINGRICH SHOULD TAKE A FLYING LEAP JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE SCUMBAGS THAT ARE TAGGING ALONG IN WAKE

WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT TWO PEOPLE WITH A FOOT TATTOO OWN THE SAME PAIR OF SHOES

R SPACE COMMENTS
NASA JUST STARTED ASKING FOR SUGGESTIONS TO CUT COSTS ON THE ORION PROGRAM ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE CONSIDERING IS USING A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR FOR COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT

I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SAFE BET THAT ORION NEVER FLIES AS SET OUT IN THE PLANNING STAGES
YOU HAVE YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AND IN THE HEAVENS AT THE SAME TIME
THOSE ERROR BARS ALSO BASICALLY ALL THE TIME PEOPLE ONLY TALK ABOUT THIS VIOLATING NEWTONS THIRD LAW WHICH I THINK IS A BROAD MISCHARACTERIZATION IF CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM IS VIOLATED THEN IT IMMEDIATLY FOLLOWS FROM THEOREM THAT TRANSLATIONAL SYMMETRY IS VIOLATED AND THUS THE AS WELL AS SPECIAL RELATIVITY ARE VIOLATED BUT SINCE WE KNOW PRETTY DAMN GOOD THAT THOSE HOLD WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR IT IS WAY WAY MORE LIKELY THAT SOMETHING WITH THE EXPERIMENT ISN'T QUITE RIGHT
DELETED
I BELIEVE ITS A COMET ONE WAS CAPTURED BY SOHO VERY RECENTLY IN A SIMILAR PICTURE I'LL DO AN EDIT IF I CAN FIND IT BUT ITS ON A THREAD HERE TOO SOMEWHERE

EDIT I CANT FIND THE POST ON HERE WHERE I SAW IT BUT A GOOGLE SEARCH FOUND THIS WHICH I THINK IS THE SAME TIME IMAGES
BUDGET FOR THERE'S THE ORION FOR THERE'S THE ZHUMELL THE IS THE CHEAPEST TELESCOPE I'D RECOMMEND BELOW THAT BUDGET GET SOME BINOCULARS
I THINK STARTING WITH A GOOD PAIR OF BINOCULARS IS A GOOD IDEA ALSO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A LOCAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY SOME OF THEM WILL PUT ON COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS THAT ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY FOR YOU TO LOOK THROUGH SOME TELESCOPES AND TALK TO SOME PEOPLE ABOUT GEAR
WATCH THIS SERIES YOU'LL LOVE IT
PHOBOS OR DEIMOS WILL PROBABLY BE NEXT AND ONE OR BOTH OF THEM MAY EVEN HAPPENED BEFORE MARS SPACE IS TARGETING A DIRECT FLIGHT TO MARS LOCKHEED IS PUSHING TO GET A MARS CONTRACT AND ONE OF THE MOONS WOULD BE MORE AKIN TO A DOCKING MANEUVER THAN A LANDING BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW MASSACHUSETTS

SO IT DEPENDS ON WHO GETS THERE FIRST IF SPACE THEN MARS FOLLOWED BY THE MOONS IF OLD AEROSPACE THEN THE OTHER WAY AROUND I BET
I ENJOYED THE FIRST PART ORBITING WAY MORE THAN THE SECOND INSIDE THOUGH THE RACK OF CAMERA GEAR WAS IMPRESSIVE IS THE FIRST PART REAL JUST WONDERING HOW THEY GOT THE SPACE STATION AHEAD OF THE OBSERVER
LOOKS COOL BUT I THINK YOU NEED A DEGREE CAPABLE IMAX THEATER TO PROPERLY ENJOY THIS
I WATCHED IT ON NASA TV BEFORE I HAD TO SWITCH OVER TO CARTOON NETWORK BECAUSE MY MOM SAID IT WAS TOO BORING
THIS FIRST ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THE ONGOING EFFORTS OF RUSSIAN AND INDIAN ROCKET VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS AND OPERATORS THE NEXT ISSUE IN THIS SERIES WILL COVER CURRENT AND ROCKETS FROM THE VARIOUS EUROPEAN ENTITIES AND AXA

OH WOW WHAT A PICTURE EVEN THE CLOUD COVER HELPED YOU GET SOME DEPTH AND FRAMING HOW DID YOU GET SO CLOSE
THEY SHOULD MAKE CARS TOO TESLA STYLE IT COULD BE A NICE BUMP IN FUNDING AND WHO WOULDN'T WANT A CAR MADE BY NASA SORRY I'M A LITTLE BUZZED IT'S FRI NIGHT MAYBE IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA
WHEN DO WE GET TO SEE THE INCREDIBLE SUNSET CAN'T WAIT LOOKS SO PROMISING
I LOVE HOW THEY HAVE THE FLAG FACING DOWN LIKE THEY'RE MOVING TOWARD THE SKY
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'D BE A COOL BUILDING TO EXPLORE IF IT WERE IN FALLOUT
COCOA HAS SOME DECENT RESTAURANTS ENJOY YOUR TIME IN THE SPACECOAST AND DON'T STAY
BEEN THERE THAT'S THE LARGEST AMERICAN FLAG I HAVE EVER AND PROBABLY WILL EVER SEE
IN THE RIGHT IS I THINK THE SLS LAUNCH TOWER I WAS THERE A FEW WEEKS AGO THEY'RE BUILDING IT SO THE MOBILE LAUNCH PLATFORM CAN DRIVE UNDER IT CONNECT UP THEN TRUNDLE INTO THE VAB FOR FINAL INTEGRATION OF THE ROCKET
READ IT AS BECOMES AND DIDN'T QUESTION IT SHIPS ARE CALLED SHE IN SPACE TOO RIGHT THE ISS ISN'T THE OLDEST THOUGH I NEED COFFEE
NO WE STILL GET USEFUL DATA FROM EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED THERE AND IT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACEFUL COOPERATION BETWEEN NATIONS IT IS HUMANITY CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT AND IS POCKET CHANGE TO MAINTAIN COMPARED TO MILITARY EXPENDITURES
BUT I LOVE TRACKING IT ONLINE AND LOOKING AT IT WITH MY NAKED EYES
I DO THINK NATIONAL PROJECTS LIKE THAT WITH HUGE LEGACY POTENTIAL WOULD BE SOMETHING TRUMP WOULD BE KEEN ON DOING I KNOW TRUMP WANTS TO SPEND BIG MONEY ON INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHAT'S A FEW EXTRA BILLION FOR NASA TO BUILD A MOON BASE
DONT TINK SMALL MARS NOT MOON INTERPLANETARY TRAVEL

TRUMP WILL BRING THE NEXT STEP IN CIVILIZATION
IS THERE A COMPELLING REASON TO RETURN TO THE MOON THERE ARE SO MANY MUCH MORE INTERESTING PLACES WITHIN REACH
WHEN THE GOP SAYS THINGS LIKE THIS NOWADAYS I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO MICROMANAGE NASA INTO MOVING AWAY FROM CLIMATE SCIENCE THEN AGAIN REPORT JIM BRIDENSTINE HAS A BILL CURRENTLY IN THE HOUSE THAT SEEMS OK IN THAT REGARD OR MAYBE I'M TOO DUMB TO READ LEGALESE

NOTHING WILL GET DONE UNDER THIS PRESIDENT

I HAVE A FEELING THAT HE THINKS THE EARTH IS FLAT AND SPACE DOESN'T REALLY EXIST
THAT'S NICE AND ALL SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT MARS MISSION THEY'VE BEEN PLANNING

OR IS ALL THAT WORK JUST GOING TO BE SCRAPPED WITH NASA STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN BUT WITH THE MOON INSTEAD AND THEN PRESUMABLY IF ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION COMES IN FOUR YEARS TIME THEY CAN SCRAP THAT PROJECT AND GET NASA TO START AGAIN WITH SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD

PERHAPS AN ORGANISATION THAT WORKS ON PROJECTS THAT TAKE DECADES TO COMPLETE SHOULDN'T BE MICROMANAGED BY POLITICIANS THAT COME AND GO EVERY FOUR TO EIGHT YEARS JUST A THOUGHT
ANY SURVEY YOU WERE LOOKING FOR IN PARTICULAR

FROM A QUICK SEARCH

GOOGLE SKY

YOU CAN ALSO FIND ONLINE ARCHIVES FROM THE SLOAN DIGITAL SKY SURVEY HERE

WHEW THEY DELAYED TO THE VERY END OF THE LAUNCH WINDOW TO GIVE THE EASTERN RANGE WHICH HANDLES DOWNRANGE TELEMETRY AND COMMUNICATIONS TIME TO RESOLVE AN ISSUE RANGE IS NOW GO

LAUNCH AT PM EST
ANYWHERE TO WATCH IT WITHOUT FLASH REQUIRED ALL OF THE FEEDS WHAT NASA IS USING REQUIRES FLASH WOULD LOVE SOMETHING WITH HEML
RESUBMITTED SWITCHED TO PUBLIC CHANNEL FROM MEDIA CHANNEL POSTED SCHEDULES AND ACTUAL SCHEDULES WERE BACKWARDS SO THE FULL LAUNCH COVERAGE WILL BE ON THIS CHANNEL INSTEAD
THE FUCK WAS THAT SECS OF COVERAGE SPACE X KNOWS HOW TO DO A LAUNCH
DELETED
SITTING IN THE ORLANDO AIRPORT RIGHT NOW JUST LOST SIGHT OF IT OUT THE WINDOW WISH I WAS CLOSER BUT STILL COOL TO SEE
I NOTICED SOMETHING WAS STILL STUCK TO THE FAIRING AFTER LIFT OFFICIAL IS THIS SUPPOSE TO BE LIKE THIS
NICE LAUNCH WISH THE PRESENTER WOULD TAKE A DRINK OF WATER EVERY TIME HE TALKS IT SOUNDS LIKE HES JUST BEEN CHUGGING MAPLE SYRUP

OTHER THAN THAT I DID LIKE HIM
PROVIDING A SOURCE AND AT LEAST SOME SCIENCE CONTEXT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS GETTING UNVOTED
NOT OP BUT I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COMPLAIN DOWNVOTE BECAUSE THIS IS JUST AN ARTISTS CONCEPTION BUT IT SHOULD BE KNOWN THAT CANCRI E IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY ROCKY PLANET WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE OF LAVA ON THE WARM SIDE AND FREQUENT VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS SO THIS ISN'T FAR OFF


IS THIS FROM SPACE ENGINE OR DID YOU CREATE THIS YOURSELF IF SO WHAT 3D APPLICATION DID YOU USE
SEEMS NICE AND TEMPERATE A BIT HOT FOR MY TASTE THOUGH

SOMEBODY PASS ME A SOMBRERO
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHANCES ARE THAT YOUR POST WILL GET AS MANY UPVOTES AS THE LINK TO THE PAPER DID EARLIER
THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S INVENTED FROM TRYING TO DO THINGS LIKE GO TO THE MOON OR BUILDING A COLONY ON MARS BENEFITS EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE A RETURN ON EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR SPENT IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY THE VERY CHALLENGE OF SUCH EXPLORATION FORCES INNOVATION IN SOFTWARE HARDWARE AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE THAT RAPIDLY FILTERS DOWN INTO EVERYDAY LIFE


THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH OF TODAY IS THE APPLICATION OF YEARS IN THE FUTURE HISTORY IS FULL OF EXAMPLES OF FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH WHERE NO ONE COULD EVEN IMAGINE AN APPLICATION AND TODAY WE ALL USE PRODUCTS THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THIS RESEARCH
WELL FOR ONE IF WE HAD A SUSTAINABLE COLONY ON MARS HUMANITY'S CACE OF EXTINCTION DECREASES EXPONENTIALLY IT CAN BE A RALLY POINT FOR FUTURE COLONIZATION AS WELL AS A BLUEPRINT TO THE PROCESS WE COULD MINE WE COULD HARVEST ENERGY WE COULD TERRACIFORM EVENTUALLY AN WOULD ACTUALLY PROBABLY HELP WITH RESEARCH NOT TO MENTION THAT WE WOULD BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO MOVING OUT OF THIS SOLAR SYSTEM AND IF YOU CANT SEE THE PURPOSE IN THAT I AM A LITTLE SAD AND A LITTLE MAD
BILLIONS IS SOMETHING OF AN EXAGGERATION ISN'T IT

ANYWAYS NOTHING IS MORE VALUABLE THAN KNOWLEDGE AND DOES LIFE EXIST OUTSIDE EARTH IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION

EITHER ANSWER WILL BE SHOCKINGLY PARADIGM SHIFTING

NOW ME PERSONALLY I FIND SPORTS A WASTE OF TIME AND ALWAYS RESENT BEING FORCED TO PAY FOR STADIUMS
AS HAS BEEN NOTED A BACKUP FOR HUMANITY IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA THAT'S WHY YOU CARRY A SPARE AROUND WITH YOU IN MOST CARS BACKUP YOUR DRIVES ETC ADDITIONALLY RESEARCH USUALLY PAYS DIVIDENDS OVER THE LONG TERM ELECTRONICS AS AN INDUSTRY CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF CENTURY ELECTROMAGNETIC RESEARCH SIMILARLY WE MIGHT FIND SOME INGENIOUS WAY OF MAKING SOMETHING IN ORBIT THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY CHEAPER THAN ON THE GROUND HYPERFILAMENT FROM THE FOUNTAINS OF PARADISE COMES TO MIND ALTERNATIVELY MANY MINOR BODIES ASTEROIDS COMETS ETC ARE RICH IN METALS WHICH ONCE INDUSTRY IS ESTABLISHED COULD TURN QUITE THE PROFIT
TO BE HUMAN IS TO BE CURIOUS TO EXPLORE TO WANT TO KNOW I AM ALSO AND DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN A CAVE
YOU HAVE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF THIS BUT TELL YOUR UNCLE THAT IF LIFE FROM EARTH IS FOUND ON MARS AS THE EP THEORY PREDICTS THE IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMANITY WILL BE STAGGERING THAT WILL MEAN THAT THERE HAVE BEEN BILLION PLUS YEARS FOR LIFE FROM EARTH TO TRAVEL TO OTHER PLANETS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND OUR GALAXY WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN FOR HUMANITY IS YET TO BE UNDERSTOOD
WELL IF WE EXACTLY KNEW WHAT WE WOULD INVENT IT WOULDN T BE RESEARCH THINGS LIKE TV AND GPS ARE ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAVE SPENT MUCH MONEY ON FIGURING OUT HOW ROCKETS AND SPACE WORKS

THE CANADARM INSTALLED ON THE ISS HAS LEAD TO SURGICAL ROBOTS THAT ASSIST IN COMPLEX SURGICAL PROCEDURES

WIKIPEDIA HAS A LIST OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE FROM NASA ALONE AND IT IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE
WIKI

NASA CLAIMS THAT THERE ARE NEARLY OTHER IN THE FIELDS OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENT AND AGRICULTURE HEALTH AND MEDICINE PUBLIC SAFETY TRANSPORTATION RECREATION AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTIVITY

BUT THE DIRECT ARE ONLY ONE SMALL CONTRIBUTION ADVANCING OUR KNOWLEDGE LEADS TO NEW DISCOVERIES AND THUS NEW TECHNOLOGIES IF HUMANS WOULD NOT DO RESEARCH WE WOULD STILL BE IN THE MIDDLE AGES OR EVEN LESS ADVANCED CURIOSITY AND THE ABILITY TO DEDUCT THINGS IS WHAT SEPARATES US FROM ANIMALS AND WHAT MADE US AS A SPECIES GROW

SPACE EXPLORATION IS THE MOST DIFFICULT MOST DEANING AND MOST PUNISHING ENDEAVOUR YOU CAN UNDERTAKE THINGS INVENTED FOR SPACE ARE USUALLY WELL TASTED SAFE AND SOUND IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING IN SPACE IT SURE AS HELL WORKS EASIER ON EARTH SO EVERY CHALLENGE WE MASTER IN SPACE EXPLORATION IS AGAIN SOME SMALL PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE WE CAN APPLY ON EARTH BUT WE OFTEN CAN'T SAY BEFOREHAND WHAT WE MIGHT FIND
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH WE SPEND TRILLIONS EACH YEAR ON SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE MEDICAID WHICH PEOPLE LIKE YOUR UNCLE LET'S JUST SAY HE'S AN OLD UNCLE LIKELY USE WE CAN AFFORD A FEW BILLION HERE AND THERE AND IF HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT A LOT IN A RELATIVE WAY THEN WHO CARES WE STILL SPENDING IT ANYWAY IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR UNCLE IS MAKING POLICY DECISIONS
IN THE EARLY ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH IN ELECTRICITY AND ELECTRONICS HAD NO IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL APPLICATION WHATSOEVER SCIENTISTS STUDIED IT BECAUSE IT WAS INTERESTING TO FIND OUT HOW THE UNIVERSE WORKS NOW THE WHOLE WORLD RUNS ON ELECTRICITY
CANT WE NEED TO REFOCUS THAT SPENDING ON FIXING OUR ATMOSPHERE AND POLLUTION PROBLEMS WHAT IS THE POINT OF EXPLORING THE UNIVERSE ONLY TO REPEAT DESTRUCTION ON ANOTHER PLANET
THE PROBLEM IS NOT WITH SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE PROBLEM IS WITH SPENDING TAXPAYER FUNDS

CONTENT ARTICLES ARTICLE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE SAYING BUT THAT'S A GOOD MOON PIC

EDIT THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD
AMAZING SHOT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A POOL OF WATER ON THE LEFT IN THAT DARK SPOT
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN MANY PHOTOS OF THE MOON THIS DETAILED NICE WORK
WHAT KIND OF LENS AND CAMRA DID YOU USE TO YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF YOUR SET UP
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING WONDERFUL JOB AND THANKS FOR SHARING I SPENT SO LONG ZOOMED IN JUST ADMIRING THE LANDSCAPE IN SUCH DETAIL I'M STILL BLOWN AWAY THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GET SUCH AN AMAZING PICTURE FROM THE CONFINES OF OUR ATMOSPHERE GALILEO WAS EXCOMMUNICATED FOR DRAWING THE SAME MOON AND NOW IT'S MY PHONE BACKGROUND

YOUR OTHER PICTURES ARE EQUALLY AWE INSPIRING I WILL ADMIT I WAS DUMBSTRUCK AT YOUR GIF OF JUPITER I WAS WONDERING HOW MANY YEARS IT TOOK TO GET IT TO FUCKING MOVE LIKE YOU COULD SEE ITS ORBIT ALMOST I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WENT TO LOOK AT THE COMMENTS TO SEE HOW YOU DID IT AND I WAS FLOORED IT ONLY HAD LIKE FORTY UP VOTES THEN I SAW IT WAS HERBAL LOL ONCE AGAIN THANKS I HOPE YOU KEEP UP THE HOBBY SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO REAP THE BENEFITS XD
WHAT ARE THE LINES OR PATHS OR WHATEVER THOSE ARE THAT COME FROM THE CRATERS
THAT'S AMAZING CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOUR PROCESS HOW ARE YOU DETERMINING THE SOIL DIFFERENCES
THE OTHER DAY I WAS LOOKING AT THE GIBBOUS MOON THROUGH A TELESCOPE AND I THINK I'VE DECIDED THAT'S THE BEST TIME TO LOOK AT IT

YOU GET TO SEE TYCHO PLATO AND COPERNICUS CRATERS ALL RIGHT ALONG THE TERMINATOR SO THEY HAVE NICE LONG SHADOWS THEY ARE EASY TO LOCATE AND EASY TO ENJOY
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE NEW WALLPAPER ON MY PHONE I HOPE THAT'S OK
COOL HERE'S MINE


I HAVE THE ZWOASI I THINK I'VE SEEN YOU ON R ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY WE HAVE A SIMILAR SET UP

AS YOU CAN SEE I MISSED A SPOT
HOW DOES ONE TAKE A PICTURE LIKE THIS WHATS THE EQUIPMENT AND HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST APPROX

HELL OF A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT I DID HETP BUT MINE WAS JUST WITH MY CELLPHONE THROUGH MY TELESCOPE STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY USE MY DLR BUT THERE'S SO MUCH TO LEARN
THAT ONE CRATER AT THE BOTTOM IS SO BIG I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE THAT ONE HIT
WOW YOU REALLY DID A GREAT JOB OF BRINGING OUT ALL THE COLORS IN PERFECT CLARITY
THAT IS PRETTY FUCKING AWESOME AND I HAD FUN SAYING YOUR LAST NAME LIKE A BAD SOPRANOS EXTRA
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PICTURES LIKE THAT AND SEE ALL THE CRATERS AND STUFF YOU REALIZE THAT OUR LITTLE BUDDY UP IN THE SKY HAS CERTAINLY PROTECTED US FROM A LOT OF THINGS
STUNNING PICTURE THANK YOU FOR SHARING I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN THE MOON LIKE THIS BEFORE HAVE YOU POSTED A HIGHER RES VERSION ANYWHERE I'D LOVE TO HAVE IT AS BACKGROUND ON MY SCREEN IT'S SIMPLY AMAZING
THAT'S SO CRAZY YOU CAN SEE THE MOON CITIES IMAGINE ALL THE MOON PEOPLE DOWN THERE JUST LIVING THEIR LIVES OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE WATCHING THEM
LOOK HOW TRANSPARENT THE MOON IS THE DARK PARTS AND DURING THE DAY IT'S LIGHT BLUE
ARE THERE ANY SATELLITES MEASURING MINERAL CONTENT ON THE MOON MARS MOSTLY MARS
MAKES IT LOOK ALIVE LIKE THERE ARE A BUNCH OF CITIES THERE WAITING TO BE DISCOVERED
I AM ALWAYS FASCINATED BY THAT CRATER AT THE BOTTOM WHEN I SEE THIS OR SIMILAR PICTURES IF THE MOON IS TIDALLY LOCKED AND WE ONLY SEE THE SAME FACE THEN HOW DID WHATEVER HIT THE MOON IT LOOKS MORE RECENT NOT COME CAREENING INTO THE EARTH

I KNOW THE DISTANCE IS GREAT AND ALL BUT STILL YOU'D THINK THE TRAJECTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY ALTERED THAT'S GOTTA AT LEAST BE A SKIMJOB NO
MINERALS NICE WHO'D YOU TAKE IT FROM THE EEE CONSORTIUM MAYBE
BEST MOON SHOT I'VE EVER SEEN WELL DONE THIS IS GENUINELY BEAUTIFUL
I ZOOMED INTO THAT BRIGHT BLUE DOT ON THE UPPER LEFT SIDE IS THAT A PICTURE OF ADOLF HITLER
FIRST TIME SEEING MOON LIKE THIS AND ITS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN I SAW IT IN THE NIGHT
THANKS
I LOVE IT I ALSO ADDED SOME RELIEF AND STYLIZED IT A LITTLE FOR FUNNIES

UNGAG ARSA
VERY BEAUTIFUL

I WAS ALWAYS FASCINATED BY ASTRONAUTS COMING BACK AND SAYING THE DIRT WAS A BROWN COLOR WHEN THEY LANDED IT'S JUST STRANGE SINCE YOU CAN'T REALLY CAPTURE THE SAME AESTHETIC FROM EARTH UNLESS YOU MAKE A MINERAL COMPOSITION PHOTO LIKE THIS
ONE OF THE BEST MOON SHOTS I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS THANKS FOR SHARING THIS
YOU TOOK THE MOON FIRST CARMEN SANDIEGO NOW YOU WILL SOMEBODY STOP THE MADNESS
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME SHARING I ADDED A STANFIELD AND RESIZED IT FOR MY DESKTOP BACKGROUND

EXURB IS GREAT CHECK OUT HIS OTHER VIDEOS ON THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL
WE COULD ALSO BE STATISTICALLY AN EARLY CIVILIZATION FIRST BASED OFF THE EXPECTED LIFESPAN OF THE UNIVERSE YEARS THE UNIVERSE HASN'T HAD TIME TO SPAWN MANY MORE HABITABLE WORLDS AND THE MILKY WAYS PLANET FORMING DAYS ARE NUMBERED
THE PROBLEM WITH THE MOON IS IT'S THE SAME ALWAYS THE SAME AND NOT PARTICULARLY BEAUTIFUL GREY AND BLOTCHY
YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A WEATHER SATELLITE NOT HAVING A ROBUST WEATHER REPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE
FORBES BLOCKS THIS SITE IF YOU'RE USING ABLOCK THEREFORE BY DEFINITION THE SITE IS NOT WORTH VISITING
HOLD ON ISN'T TEMPERATURE MEASURED BY THE SPEED OF MOLECULES MOVING IN AN AREA SO IF IT WERE COMPLETELY EMPTY SPACE THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY TEMPERATURE YEAH
YOU CAN REALLY GET A SENSE OF THE AMAZING GIMBAL RANGE OF THE SEMES IN THIS PHOTO AS THEY CENTER THE THRUST OF THE STS

I DIDN'T REALIZE THE ROCKETS ALSO FIRED ON LIFTOFF THOUGHT THOSE WERE ONLY USED IN SPACE
THE BEST PART ABOUT THESE THINGS IS THAT THE ROCKET ENGINES ARE FED FUEL BY BASICALLY A REALLY BIG ELECTRIC TURBOCHARGER THAT RAMS FUEL INTO THE CHAMBER AND MAINTAINS BACK PRESSURE TO KEEP THE ROCKET FROM EXPLODING BECAUSE IT'S LITERALLY JUST A BOMB THAT BLOWS UP SLOWLY AND IN ONLY ONE DIRECTION
DELETED
THERE WILL BE NO SERVICING IT'S ONE GO MONOLITHIC MISSION

I AM SURE FUTURE SPACE TOURISTS AND SOUVENIR COLLECTORS WOULD BE DELIGHTED WITH THIS SATELLITE
THAT'S THE PROBLEM CURRENTLY WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SPACECRAFT CAPABLE OF SERVICING THE AWST SO IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG THERE'S NO GETTING TO IT UNTIL WE CAN MAKE A NEW MANNED VEHICLE THAT CAN SURVIVE FOR A COUPLE MONTHS ON ITS OWN
THEY DID ADD A DOCKING PORT TO AWST ON THE OFF CHANCE WE DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGIES TO GO OUT THAT FAR BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SERVICE IT
ORBITAL ATK IS LAUNCHING A SPACE REPAIR TUG IN LATE ON A PROTON ROCKET IT WILL MATE UP WITH AN INTELSAT SATELLITE FOR CHECKOUT THEN PROCEED TO ANOTHER SATELLITE THAT NEEDS REFUELING AND POSSIBLY COURSE CORRECTION THERE IS A BIG ADDITION TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF SPACE AND THAT IS BEING ABLE TO REPAIR AND RETURN LARGE SATELLITES FROM LOW ORBIT NOW GEO IN A COUPLE MORE YEARS THERE ARE OTHER REPAIR REFUELING TUG ROBOT SPACECRAFT BEING DEVELOPED THE HOPE IS AWST DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMMEDIATE CATASTROPHIC FAILURES AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR EITHER BEING TOWED BACK TO A REPAIR ORBIT OR REPAIRED REFUELED COURSE CORRECTION SYSTEMS WILL BE IN PLACE BY THE TIME IT IS NEEDED ALSO SLS BLOCK II AND ORION WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY A MILLION MILES IS ONLY TIMES THE DISTANCE TO THE MOON AND SLS IS BEING DESIGNED TO TAKE VERY LARGE PAYLOADS INTO VERY HIGH ORBITS POSSIBLE L1 ASSEMBLY OF THE MTV

INVESTING GENERAL
IF THERE IS ANY ENTITY IN THE WORLD THAT CAN PULL THIS OFF ITS NASA THEY ARE FAR AND AWAY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM ON THESE BIG TENTPOLE MISSIONS THOUGH
PROSPECTS FOR A REPAIR AREN'T HOPELESS EVENTUALLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO REACH L2 AND MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIX WHATEVER IS WRONG THE TELESCOPE WON'T BE GOING ANYWHERE

BUT YEAH IF IT FAILS THEN FUTURE PROSPECTS OR NOT IT WILL BE LABELLED A DOLLAR WASTE OF TAXPAYER MONEY NASA REMEMBERS THE HUBBLE FIASCO AND IS DOING EVERYTHING WITHIN THEIR POWER TO MAKE SURE IT IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL BEFORE LAUNCH

WHY DO YOU ASSUME IT WILL BE SERVICED HUBBLE IS PRETTY UNIQUE IN THAT WAY SATELLITES RARELY ARE DESIGNED FOR BEING SERVICED AND AWST IS NO EXCEPTION IF IT FAILS IT FAILS THATS WHY SO MUCH MONEY IS SPENT ON BUILDING IT PROPERLY AND MAKING SURE IT ACTUALLY WORKS WITHOUT HICCUPS
OH SNAP

SO HERE'S ONE IDEA A LOT OF MONEY IS SPENT AS OVERHEADS HAVING SLS AROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE

SO LAUNCH MORE OF THEM TO SPREAD OUT THE COSTS
THANKS TO UTAH WE CAN EXPECT THEM TO EXPLODE LIKE THE CHALLENGER SEGMENTED DEATH STICKS
CANCEL IT AND FOCUS ON SOMETHING WORTHWHILE THEIR PLANS SEEM LESS AMBITIOUS THAN THE PRIVATE COMPANIES NASA SHOULD DO STUFF THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT GET DONE EVERYTHING ELSE SHOULD GO TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR ESPECIALLY FERRYING STUFF TO LEO

THIS IS THE EXPEDITION LAUNCH WHICH TOOK PLACE ON THURSDAY NOVEMBER
THAT'S CRAZY I'VE NEVER SEEN A SUCCESSFUL LONG EXPOSURE OF A LAUNCH WITH A REMOTE CAMERA COOL
FIIIIIIIINAAAAAAAAL FLAAAAAAAAAAASH BUT SERIOUSLY THAT LOOKS AMAZING
BEAUTIFUL PHOTO BUT HOW IS THE WHOLE IMAGE NOT OVEREXPOSED I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT SCENE WOULD BE INCREDIBLY BRIGHT
I HAVE A QUESTION WOULDN'T THE SMOKE FROM THE LAUNCH MAKE THE IMAGE MUCH MORE HAZY AND BLURRED THAN IT APPEARS TO BE
SOMEONE CALL THE AVENGERS THERE MUST BE A SOME SHIT GOING DOWN BECAUSE SKYBEAM IS NEVER A GOOD SIGN
THIS REMINDS THE ION CANNON FROM C C SERIES

F E
SHOULDN'T TRON BE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT IDENTITY DISK HELD HIGH
I DIDN'T KNOW KAZAKHSTAN BUILT A STARKVILLE

AWESOME PHOTO THAT'S TRULY AMAZING


I DON'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND LONG EXPOSURES SOMETIMES FORGIVE ME FOR BEING STUPID LOL BUT IF THE SHUDDER IS LEFT OPEN THEN WHY DON'T WE SEE LIKE ALL THE SMOKE AND THAT SOME LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOS LIKE THIS ONE MAKE ME WONDER THINGS LIKE THIS AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW
WE NEED TO UNVOTE ALL THE REPASTS OF THIS TO THE TOP SO THE FRONT PAGE OF REDDIN LOOKS LIKE ONE GIANT CHURRO
DAMN THAT'S BEAUTIFUL LOOKS LIKE HENRION IS ABOUT TO LAY OUT SOME WISHES
KINDA LOOKS LIKE THE BIFROST FROM THOR
DELETED
LONG EXPOSURE OF SOYUZ LAUNCH TO THE ISS OR ALIEN BEAM FROM THE FAR REACHES OF SPACE

WE MAY NEVER KNOW
REMINDS ME OF CYCLOPS MORE SPECIFICALLY THE ONE FROM STREET FIGHTER VS SUPER OPTIC BLAST
LOOKS LIKE A SPACE ELEVATOR THAT HAS JUST FINISHED CONSTRUCTION AND IS BEING ACTIVATED FOR THE FIRST TIME
VIDEOS IN THIS THREAD

WATCH PLAYLIST

VIDEO COMMENT

A FANTASTIC VIDEO OF SOYUZ A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH FROM VOSTOCHNY COSMODROME ONLY SOLIDS REALLY GENERATE A LOT OF SMOKE THOUGH THERE IS A BIT OF DUST AT THE START
STARKVILLE BASE FIRING HD I DIDN'T KNOW KAZAKHSTAN BUILT A STARKVILLE AWESOME PHOTO THAT'S TRULY AMAZING
TRON DANGER BOOTLEG TOURNAMENT TRAIN HIM FOR THE GAMES LET HIM HOPE FOR A WHILE AND BLOW HIM AWAY
DBS TRUNKS LEGENDARY SUPER SAIPAN BLUE TRANSFORMATION I THOUGHT OF THIS TRUNKS TRANSFORMATION IN SUPER
I'M A BOT WORKING HARD TO HELP REDDITORS FIND RELATED VIDEOS TO WATCH

PLAY ALL INFO GET IT ON CHROME FIREBOX
ACQUISITION DETAILS DID YOU HAVE A SOLAR FILTER ON OR SOMETHING TO DARKEN THE PHOTO BY SO MUCH
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING VILLAINS WOULD TARGET TO DESTROY CORRUPT THE REGION IT'S IN LIKE A WORLD CRYSTAL OR A POWER CORE
INCREDIBLE I WONDER HOW DARK THE ND FILTER HAD TO BE THE MOST EXTREME ND FILTERS AVAILABLE CAN TURN A SECONDS WORTH OF LIGHT INTO MONTHS
REMINDS ME OF THE LAUNCH BASE ZONE FROM SONIC THE HEDGEHOG

GO GO GOGOGO GO GO GO
IT'S ON PHOTOSHOPBATTLES RIGHT NOW
MADE ME THINK OF THIS
SO LITTLE BIT OF AN ENGLAND QUESTION LOOKING AT THIS SHAPE HORIZONTAL EXIT FROM NOZZLE CAN WE SAY IT IS IN OPTIMUM EXIT PRESSURE AKA P2
I ALWAYS STRUGGLE WITH HOW FAST A ROCKET TAKES OFFICIAL SHOOTING FIREWORKS THEY SHOOT TO THE SKY SUPER FAST BUT I FEEL LIKE A ROCKET HAS TO START OFF SLOW LIKE IT JUST I NEED TO SEE ONE IN PERSON TO FATHOM IT
I'M HEARING THE INCEPTION NOISE WHILE LOOKING AT THIS OR THE REAPER NOISE FROM MASS EFFECT

DISAPPOINTING

THIS IMAGE IS BEST ENJOYED WITH THE PROPER MUSIC

WATCH V

IS THERE ANY ADVANTAGE TO THE WAY THE RUSSIANS HOLD ROCKETS IN PLACE WITH THOSE LIKE HOLDERS THAT FLOP AWAY AT LAUNCH VS WHAT WE USE WITH THE LARGE TOWERS
I WONDER IF THE PHOTOGRAPHER NEEDED TO STABILIZE THE CAMERA BECAUSE OF THE GROUND VIBRATIONS CREATED BY THE ROCKET LAUNCH
I WONDER WHAT THE ATMOSPHERE WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE COULD SEE A LONG EXPOSURE OF EVERY ROCKET TRAIL
IT LOOKS LIKE KIDS TOY TRUCKS AND WHATNOT SCATTERED IN FRONT OF A CURTAINED WINDOW WITH JUST A SLIVER OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH WHERE THE PANELS MEET

I NEED TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE MORE
I'VE BEEN ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES THAT WAS ABLE TO WITNESS ONE OF THESE LAUNCHES IRL THE THING THAT JUMPS INTO MY MIND EVERY TIME I THINK BACK IS THE AWESOME OVERWHELMING SOUND OF THOSE ENGINES
OH NOW I HAVE TO STOP VEGETAL OR THE EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED
KAMEHAMEHA
NOT ENOUGH KWAIKEN TIMES
AN INTERESTING FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT KNOW THE SMOKE YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING ON LAUNCHES IS ACTUALLY WATER VAPOUR AT LAUNCH HUNDREDS OF TONNES OF WATER FLOOD THE LAUNCH PAD TO DAMPEN THE NOISE AND SHOCKWAVE FROM THE ENGINES BOTH FOR OUR ANYONE WATCHING SAFETY AND THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF SURROUNDING BUILDINGS AND THE ROCKET ITSELF EXPLANATIONS CAN BE FOUND THROUGH THIS THREAD EXPLAINING WHY IT DOESN'T SHOW UP ON THESE TYPES OF EXPOSURES
FUCK THE ISS STOP TERRORIZING AMERICA WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING LEAVE THE MIDDLE EAST ALONE
THEY'RE OKAY TO HANG OUT WITH BUT I WOULDN'T INVITE THEM HOME FOR DINNER
I THINK THIS UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING AND IS FINITE I'M INTERESTED IN TIME OVER DISTANCE AND WHAT TIME ACTUALLY IS WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT ON ENERGY IF TIME HAD MAGNITUDE AND IF TIME WAS NOT UNIFORM THROUGH OUT THE UNIVERSE WHAT IF THE EFFECTS OF TIME WERE DIFFERENT FROM THE QUANTUM LEVEL TO THE UNIVERSAL LEVEL I'M A PROFESSIONAL COFFEE TASTER SO I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BUT I'VE WONDERED ABOUT THAT FOR YEARS
SO I WAS JUST READING ABOUT BLACK HOLES AND THEY SAID THERE HAVE BEEN NO WHITE HOLES DISCOVERED EVER BUT THAT ONE MAY HAVE STARTED THE BIG BANG AND CREATED THE UNIVERSE

SO IF A WHITE HOLE IS THE OTHER SIDE OF A BLACK HOLE WE ARE LIVING INSIDE A BLACK HOLE AND OUR UNIVERSE WAS SPAWNED FROM A BLACK HOLE IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE AND BLACK HOLES SPAWN MORE UNIVERSES INSIDE OUR BLACK HOLE AND INSIDE ALL OF THOSE BLACK HOLES YOU GET THE IDEA

THE UNIVERSE IS EVER EXPANDING BECAUSE THE BLACK HOLE WE LIVE IN CONTINUES TO CONSUME SPACE WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO TRAVEL TO THE POINT WOULD SPACE ACT DIFFERENTLY AS YOU TRAVEL TOWARDS THE OTHER UNIVERSES BLACK HOLE EVENT HORIZON IF THAT POINT ISN'T ALREADY SO INFINITELY SMALL TO YOU AND COMPLETELY LOST IN THE ABYSS THAT IS A BLACK HOLE WHICH IS OUR ENDLESS SPACE

THIS IS OF COURSE A THEORY AND VERY INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT
YES BUT ONLY A STONE FROM AN ASTEROID METERS BIG

THERE IS ALREADY AN ASTEROID BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE MOON THE ASTEROID IS CALLED HE CAME INTO THIS ORBIT YEARS AGO
I THINK THIS MISSION GETS CANCELLED UNDER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION
OK SO THIS DUPLICATED A FEW TIMES SO HERE IT IS

THIS WAS MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT THE HORSEHEAD NEBULA AND MY FIRST SHOT WITH MY NEW CODDED DLR

GOOD LUCK
THIS IS SO INSPIRATIONAL
SHE WAS ALSO THE FIRST WOMAN AND I THINK THE FIRST TO BE CHIEF OF THE ASTRONAUT OFFICE
NA THE SPACECRAFT IS GOING TO BE IN A VERY HIGH ORBIT AND CURRENTLY THE SECOND STAGE IS STILL IN FLIGHT WITH THE SPACECRAFT THE UPPER STAGE HASN'T MADE A SINGLE REVOLUTION AROUND THE EARTH YET CURRENTLY CLIMBING TO APOGEE AND THE BOOSTER SPLASHED DOWN IN THE ATLANTIC
MAY HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE OR THE ISS WHEN THEY PASS INTO SHADOW THEY VANISH

THERE WAS A MAG PASS OF ARBS IN THAT TIMEFRAME AFTER THE LAUNCH THAT PASSED INTO SHADOW

LAT LNG LOC LAND O LAKES ALT T EST ISATID JD
PLANETS AROUND OTHER STARS USED TO BE FANTASY WE'VE FOUND THOUSANDS THROUGH DEDUCTION AND EVEN VISIBLY OBSERVED A FEW MORE WE'VE GOT A NEW SATELLITE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE THAT'LL MAKE HUBBLE LOOK LIKE A TOY

WE'VE BASICALLY CONFIRMED THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING AND HAS BEEN SINCE THE BIG BANG THANKS TO THE AMAP RESEARCH

WE'VE DETERMINED THAT ORGANIC MOLECULES LIKE AMINO ACIDS CAN TRAVEL ON COMETS GIVING CREDENCE TO THE ONCE SCOFFED AT IDEA OF PANSPERMIA WE'VE ALSO DETERMINED MARS LIKELY HAD CONSTANT LIQUID WATER AT SOME POINT WHICH IS ANOTHER GREAT INDICATOR OF LIFE OUT THERE

WE'VE MAPPED COUNTLESS STARS AND GALAXIES AND BASICALLY THE IDEA THAT LIFE IS OUT THERE IS ALL BUT A GIVEN THE ONLY QUESTION WE HAVE IS OKAY WHAT ABOUT COMPLEX LIFE AND BEYOND

SETI STILL ISN'T TAKEN ALL THAT SERIOUSLY THOUGH THOUGH MORE SO THAN THEY WERE BACK WHEN COFFEE CANS AND SATELLITE DISHES WERE THEIR BREAD AND BUTTER AND BAD NEWS PLUTO ISN'T A PLANET ANYMORE EITHER THE GALACTIC COUNCIL VOTED AGAINST IT OR SOMETHING
IN I WAS TAUGHT THAT PLUTO WAS THE FURTHEST PLANET FROM THE SUN WHEN IN FACT IN WAS NEPTUNE AT THAT TIME

DOCS STARCHILY QUESTIONS

HOWEVER SINCE NEPTUNE CROSSED ORBIT IS ONCE AGAIN CLOSER TO THE SUN AND WELL YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT DEMOTION
MY GRANDMA HAS A SCHOOL BOOK IT TALKS ABOUT VEGETATION AND LIFE ON MARS IT'S FUNNY READING IT TODAY
VERY SADLY WHAT YOU LEARN IN MIDDLE SCHOOL TODAY IS ALSO WRONG AND IF YOU DON'T GO TO COLLEGE YOU WILL NEVER KNOW SPECIAL RELATIVITY QUANTUM MECHANICS
THE RARE EARTH HYPOTHESIS

THE IDEA THAT EARTH IS SOMEHOW SPECIAL AND THAT THE CONDITIONS FOR FORMING LIFE REQUIRE A LONG SET OF COINCIDENCES THAT MEAN LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE COULD BE EXTREMELY RARE

YEAH RIGHT

EVEN IF TURN OUT TO BE RARE IT WONT MATTER BECAUSE IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM ALONE WE NOW KNOW OF WORLDS WE'RE SURE HAVE UNDERGROUND SUBSURFACE OCEANS AND ANOTHER WE SUSPECT TO BUT HAVE YET TO BE CONFIRMED EVERY YEAR ANOTHER CANDIDATE IS ADDED TO THAT LIST SUBSURFACE OCEANS ARE CLEARLY THE MOST COMMON HABITAT FOR LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE ALIEN LIFE UNDER THE ICY MOONS OF GAS GIANTS PROBABLY OUTNUMBER NORMAL LIFE TO

PLANETS ARE AROUND OTHER STARS THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING AMINO ACIDS EXIST ON COMETS PLUTO ISN'T A PLANET MARS HAS LIQUID WATER
REMOVED
DELETED
BIGELOW HIMSELF HAS A DIRECT INTEREST IN RAMPING UP NASA FUNDING HIS COMPANY BIGELOW AEROSPACE IS IN THE RUNNING FOR THE DEEP SPACE HABITAT CONTRACT IN THE ORION PROGRAM AND THE TECHNOLOGY FOR PROPOSED DEEP SPACE HABITAT IS ALREADY BEING TESTED AT THE ISS IN THE BEAM MODULE THE DEEP SPACE HABITAT WOULD BE USED TO HOUSE ASTRONAUTS DURING MISSIONS BEYOND THE MOON TO MARS AND THE ASTEROIDS
I DON'T WANT TO SEE MORE MONEY MINDLESSLY SHOVELED INTO NASA WITHOUT A SPECIFIC PURPOSE I'D RATHER SEE IT STARVED OF ALL FUNDS THAN HAVE FUNDING MISDIRECTED TO FAILING PURPOSELESS PROGRAMS LIKE THE SLS AND ORION CAPSULE

IF THE FUNDING WAS TO SUPPORT MORE EXPLORATION OF THE LUNAR OR MARTIAN SURFACES MORE PROBES TO GO AND LOOK AT THE MOONS OF JUPITER OR EVEN R D FOR A PERMANENT SPACE STATION AT ONE OF THE LAGRANGIAN POINTS OR IN ORBIT AROUND THE MOON I'M OK WITH IT IF NOT

NASA LOST ITS WAY A LONG TIME AGO THROWING MORE MONEY AT IT WON'T FIX THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS
CAN WE SEE THE BUSINESS CASE FOR THIS THOUGH

NOT LIKE THE GOVT IS FLUSH WITH CASH AND AT THIS POINT PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS HANDLING COMMERCIAL NEEDS WITH FAR LOWER COSTS I SEE NO REASON TO FIGHT THIS TREND
CAN'T SEE IT HAPPENING THE REDUBS CUT THINGS BACK A LOT UNDER W INCLUDING THE SHUTTLE AND ANY POTENTIAL SUCCESSOR THEY MADE IT CLEAR THEY WANT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TO TAKE OVER IF TRUMP DELIVERS ON HIS PLEDGE TO CUT PERSONAL AND BUSINESS TAXES THERE WILL BE EVEN LESS MONEY AVAILABLE
IT'S MADE OUT OF GLASS YOU CAN LOOK THROUGH TO THE MOLTEN CORE EVERY YEARS THE GLASS PLANET HAPPENS TO FOCUS THE LIGHT ON IT'S MOON MELTING A HOLE INTO IT
EARTH WE CAN CREATE THE LOWEST TEMPERATURE IN THE UNIVERSE WE ARE THE COOLEST PLANET
BUDGET THERE IS NOTHING GOOD UNDER

THE ORION IS CURRENTLY AT COMPARED TO THE NORMAL I WOULD CONSIDER THAT THE MINIMUM
HELLO WHAT IS YOUR BUDGET

DON'T RELY ON SUPER DISCOUNTS MOST STORES HAVE JUST THE TYPICAL BAD ENTRY LEVEL TELESCOPES DESPITE SOME GOOD REVIEWS ON THEIR SITES SO NO BEST SELLERS AND FIVE-STAR RATED TELESCOPES AND MAGNIFICATION SUPER BEGINNER TELESCOPES


CHECK AND EVEN THERE DON'T BUY JUST ANY TELESCOPE



WHAT IS YOUR BUDGET



ZHUMELL BEST ACCESSORIES LARGE APERTURE WHAT TO EXPECT IN DIFFERENT TELESCOPE APERTURE SIZES

SKYWATCHER IS THE CHEAPEST AND HAS A BETTER FINDER THAN THE CHECK FOR USED ONES AROUND UNDER

THERE'S ALSO THE COELECTRON NEXSTAR SLT BUT GOTO DOES NOT MAKE EVERYTHING EASIER AND MOST MONEY GOES TOWARDS A CHEAP COMPUTERIZED MOUNT A WILL NOT SHOW NEARLY AS MUCH AS A A GOOD GUIDE SUCH AS TURN LEFT AT ORION IS AN EASIER READ THAN THE MANUAL AND YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW A FEW BASICS ANYWAY EVEN WITH GOTO AND WITH A GOOD GUIDE FINDING THINGS ISN'T REALLY ALL THAT DIFFICULT PLUS THERE ARE FREE APPS THAT WILL UTILIZE YOUR MOTION SENSORS TO LITERALLY POINT YOU IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION





DOBSONIAN SKYWATCHER HAS A BETTER FOCUSER AND FINDER THAN THE ORION ALSO CHECK FOR USED ONES SEE BELOW






USED REFURBISHED

AWB ONISKEY OR ZHUMELL MEADE LIGHTBRIDGE MINI

FOR IT'S USED REFURBISHED PRICE THE DESPITE A BIT LESS APERTURE THE LONG FOCAL LENGTH HAS CONTRAST BENEFITS




NOT A WHOLE LOT SKYSCANNER BUT TELESCOPES IN THIS PRICE RANGE HAVE MULTIPLE FLAWS

AVOID THE AND OTHER REFLECTORS WITH A MUCH SHORTER TUBE THAN THEIR FOCAL LENGTH EXCEPTION MAKSUTOVS




UNDER MOST LIKELY BINOCULARS OR A USED ONE




CLEAR SKIES
THIS IS THE SAME ROCKET THAT WILL BE TAKING UP THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IN OCTOBER OF
OTHER IMAGES HERE
ANYONE WHO CAN LINK TO SOME STATS OR DETAILS ABOUT THE THRUST OF THE BOOSTERS IN THE SIDE VS THE CENTER ONE AND IS IT SOLID ROCKETS OR LIQUID ENGINES LIKE THE CENTER ONE
PHOTO CREDIT HAMIL ZHUMATOV REUTERS
THE ROCKET IS SMILING A SAYING SEND ME SEND ME SEND ME TO DESTINY
EITHER YOU GUYS ARE STUPID OR ITS ME BECAUSE THAT LOOKS AN AWFUL LOT LIKE THE SUN AND I KNOW HOW TO USE A SEMICOLON AND RECOGNIZE AN ON RUNNING SENTENCE
IF THEY THINK THAT'S THE MOON THEY SHOULD GO OVER THEIR CALCULATIONS AGAIN
SUN OR MOON ITS TERRIBLE QUALITY ESPECIALLY AFTER JUST SEEING THAT SHUTTLE PHOTO TAKEN BY SIX CAMERAS WHICH WAS WHOAAAA EYE POPPING THIS ONE IS NICE IN THEORY BUT FAIL IN ACTUAL PHOTO
I STILL THINK THE VIDEO CAPTURED BY CASSINI OF THE HEXAGON ROTATING IS COOLER THAN THE STILLS EVEN IF IT IS IN FALSE COLOR
HEXAGONS ARE ONE NATURES MOST EFFICIENT SHAPES AND ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE HETP

THIS IS REALLY COOL
SATURN IS THE 6TH PLANET FROM THE SUN







A HEXAGON HAS SIDES

I'VE BEEN HACKING UP A LUNG FOR THE LAST WEEK BUT GOD DAMN DID THE SMOKE MAKE FOR SOME BEAUTIFUL MOONRISES
TAKEN EARLY OCTOBER FOCAL LENGTH MM F 2 ISO TWO 2 MINUTE EXPOSURES ONE FOR THE SKY AND ONE FOR THE FOREGROUND COMBINED IN PHOTOSHOP HERE'S HOW IT'S DONE
IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY OPEN THIS PHOTO AT FULL RESOLUTION THE SMALL PREVIEW DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE
THIS MAKES ME WANT TO GET A GOOD CAMERA AND LEARN ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY INSPIRING WORK OP
AWESOME PHOTO WHAT TIME DID YOU SHOOT THIS SIRIUS GETS HIGH ENOUGH ONLY NEAR AM HERE IN ITALY
THANKS FOR THE NEW PHONE WALLPAPER


IT DOES LOOK GORGEOUS
THESE IDEAS MAKE A LOT OF SENSE BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL EVIDENCE FOR ALIEN VISITATION HERE ON EARTH THAT I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE NOT WATCHING US
SEEMS TO BE AIMED MAINLY AT REDUCING COSTS FOR THESE SYSTEMS THOUGH WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF REPLACEMENT AUGMENTATION I DOUBT THAT'LL WORK OUT THOUGH THERES NOT REALLY A WHOLE LOT TO MAKE CHEAPER ON SLS OR ORION THE BASIC ARCHITECTURE IS INHERENTLY GOING TO RESULT IN A CRAZY EXPENSIVE DESIGN
THE ARTICLE IS PRETTY TERRIBLE BUT NEWT IS REALLY A BIG NASA SUPPORTER I'D RATHER HAVE TRUMP APPOINT HIM THAN SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T BELIEVE IN NASA

HAHAHAHAHA

OME CAN'T BREATHE

READS ARTICLE AGAIN

BWAAAAHAHAHA
MADE A LITTLE PHONE BACKGROUND

THANKS FOR SHARING IT'S A GREAT PHOTO
REGARDLESS OF WHAT I'M LEARNING ABOUT I ALWAYS LEARN FASTER BY DOING I HATE SCHOOL BECAUSE I NEVER GET TO EXPERIENCE THE SUBJECT MATTER IN THE REAL WORLD SO I'M ESSENTIALLY TAKING THE WORD FOR EVERYTHING WHICH IS PRETTY DANGEROUS IMO I WISH LEARNING WAS MORE LIKE THE CHEMISTRY LABS I USED TO TAKE
DEPENDS ON THE ACTIVITY YOU'RE CERTAINLY BETTER OFF NOT ATTEMPTING SKYDIVING THAN FAILING AT IT
DOZER THE GOMARIAN SOMEONE IN NASA IS A CLASSIC GHOSTBUSTERS FAN THEN
I'M LEAVING ORLANDO TODAY AND WAS REALLY HOPING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THIS LAUNCH UNFORTUNATELY THE LAUNCH DATE WAS MOVED FROM THE TO TODAY MAYBE I WILL BE ABLE TO SEE IT FROM THE AIRPORT THOUGH

I'M A BIT CONFUSED BY THE QUESTION HEAT IS THE PRESENCE OF THERMAL ENERGY AND COLD IS COMPARATIVE MEANING SOMETHING HAS LESS THERMAL ENERGY THAN WHATEVER YOU'RE COMPARING IT TO IF A MATERIAL CONDUCTS HEAT WELL IT ALLOWS THERMAL ENERGY TO TRANSFER THROUGH IT EFFICIENTLY LIKE COPPER IF SOMETHING HOLDS THERMAL ENERGY IT INEFFICIENTLY TRANSFERS THERMAL ENERGY TO ITS SURROUNDINGS AEROGEL PERHAPS I'M TRYING TO REFER TO SOLID MATERIALS PRESUMABLY AT AROUND ROOM TEMPERATURE AS REQUESTED BUT MATERIALS CAN MELT OR BOIL SO IT DEPENDS ON YOUR TEMPERATURE RANGE TOO

ON THE MOLECULAR LEVEL THERMAL ENERGY IS THE VIBRATION OR MOTION OF PARTICLES THAT MEANS THINGS THAT ARE MORE DENSE MORE PARTICLES TOGETHER IN A SMALLER VOLUME TEND TO MORE EFFICIENTLY PASS THAT ENERGY ON TO NEIGHBOURING PARTICLES BY THE WAY OF CONDUCTION OTHER FACTORS ENTER INTO THE EQUATION BUT I'M TRYING TO KEEP IT SIMPLE

IF YOU'RE ASKING FOR SOMETHING THAT DOES BOTH AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THE FIELD BUT I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A BIT LIKE ASKING TO MEET A PERSON THAT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY BOTH VERY TALL AND VERY SHORT THERE IS A SPECTRUM BETWEEN GOOD CONDUCTOR AND BAD CONDUCTOR WHERE SOMETHING THAT DOES BOTH IS ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE AND DOES NEITHER PARTICULARLY WELL

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY IS A MEASURE OF HOW A MATERIAL CONDUCTS HEAT THOUGH IF THAT HELPS AEROGEL WOULD HAVE A RELATIVELY LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY COPPER WOULD HAVE A RELATIVELY HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY

HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS IT'S NOT THE BEST SCIENTIFIC ANSWER I'VE EVER GIVEN BUT THE QUESTION MAKES IT A TRICKY ONE TO HELPFULLY ANSWER
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS BOTH A DECENT HEAT CONDUCTOR AND HAS A HIGH SPECIFIC HEAT THERE AREN'T MANY SOLID MATERIALS THAT ARE GOOD AT BOTH WATER IS ONE OF THE BEST
I MEAN IT'S THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY ALREADY
WE NEED A MONOBASE JUST AYIN
THIS IS THE ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT TRUMP SO FAR AND WHO KNOWS IF HE WILL ACTUALLY DO IT BUT THE FACT THAT HE IS PUSHING FOR SPACE AS A YEAR OLD WHO WILL GROW UP AS WE GO TO MARS AND OTHER PLACES I WANT TO GO TO MARS I REALLY HOPE HE FOLLOWS THROUGH WITH THE THINGS HE SAWS ABOUT SPACE BUT WE NEVER KNOW
AS A POLITICAL CANDIDATE I'LL GO WITH HOW PEOPLE FEEL AND I'LL LET YOU GO WITH THE THEORETICIANS NEWT GINGRICH

YOU THINK THIS MAN IS INTERESTED AT ALL IN SCIENCE THIS MINDSET IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR PARTY
TRUMP WHO'S A BUSINESS MAN AND DOES ANYTHING TO LOWER THE BOTTOM LINE AND THE GOP THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING IN YEARS

KEEP DREAMING
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN THERE QUIT TRYING TO MAKE THE S HAPPEN AGAIN AND GET TO MARS
WHY IS THIS BEING DOWN VOTED THIS IS AN HONEST QUESTION AND NOT SOMEONE BEING A DICK AT ALL
YES BUT NOT PERCEPTIBLY DIFFERENT THE ISS HAS MAYBE A FEW EXTRA NANOSECONDS PER EARTH YEAR BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTLY LOWER GRAVITY

YOU'VE WATCHED INTERSTELLAR HAVE YOU NOT
YES AND NUMBER YES IN THAT THERE WOULD BE A DIFFERENCE BUT UNLESS A PLANET IS REALLY CLOSE TO A SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE THE DIFFERENCES WOULD BE MEASURED IN MICRO OR NANOSECONDS PER YEAR
LAYPERSON HERE DOES THIS PAPER SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT THE EM DRIVE DOES INDEED PRODUCE THRUST MN KW SEEMS A VERY LITTLE THRUST FOR QUIT A BIT OF ENERGY
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE THE PLANET AND MOVE IT INTO THE HABITABLE ZONE
THEN IT CAN BECOME EARTH II AND WE CAN MOVE THERE WHEN THIS PLANET IS NO LONGER INHABITABLE IN A FEW THOUSAND YEARS
ALTHOUGH IT'LL PROBABLY TAKE A FEW THOUSAND YEARS FOR PLANET MOVING TECHNOLOGY TO CATCH UP
HMM PARADOXICAL
WHY DO SCIENCE REPORTERS USE THE PHRASE THE PLANET IS JUST LIGHT YEARS AWAY

EVEN ONE LIGHT YEAR IS NOT A SMALL DISTANCE
THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN MOMENTS BEFORE WILD HOUNDS DEVOURED A NASA ASTRONAUT
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT IF I'M AN ASTRONAUT I CAN'T BRING MY BABY GOATS TO WORK THAT'S APPALLING
IF HE'S GOT A PC HAVE A LOOK AT HERBAL SPACE PROGRAM OTHERWISE THERE'S LOADS OF MISSION PATCHES ON EBAY YOU COULD PUT ON A NASA POLO SHIRT APOLLO ONES IF HE'S INTO THE OLD DAYS OR SPACE SHUTTLE FOR THE THIRTYSOMETHINGS IF HE'S A BIG KID OR YOU'VE GOT KIDS THERE'S A CARDBOARD KIT ROCKET YOU CAN GET AT VARIOUS RETAILERS HOPE THAT HELPS

EDIT TO ADD A CANVAS PRINT OF EARTH RISE LOOKS BRILLIANT HUNG ON A WALL
DOES HE HAVE ANY FAVOURITE ASTRONAUTS
I WAS GIVEN A BOOK AUTOGRAPHED BY CHRIS HADFIELD AND I SWEAR I STARE AT THAT THING LOVINGLY ALMOST EVER NIGHT
IF THIS IS HIS FAVOURITE SUB ISN'T THERE A CHANCE HE'S GONNA FIND OUT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING HIM EVERYONE WITH A WIFE CHECK THEIR REDDIN ACCOUNTS

EDIT ACTUALLY NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO ANY OF THE COMMENTS IT'LL ONLY NARROW IT DOWN
THE MINI MUSEUM IS PRETTY AWESOME THEY ARE A LITTLE PRICY AND I'M NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE THAT'S THE NAME BUT THEY ARE LIMITED NUMBERS THE LAST RUN THEY DID HAD A BUNCH OF STUFF LIKE A SMALL PIECE OF A MOON ROCK AND METEORITE
I'D RECOMMEND BINOCULARS YOU CAN GET THESE I HAVE THESE AND EVEN THOUGH I LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CITY WITH MILLION PEOPLE IN IT I ENJOY LOOKING AT THE NIGHT SKY
GET ONE OF THOSE PORTHOLE SHAPED FRAMES AND A SICK SPACE PRINT AND THROW IT ON THE WALL
A FEW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

THERE'S A GOOD MOVIE DOCUMENTARY CALLED IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON

NASA HAS SOME POSTERS OF THE PLANETS AND MISSIONS THAT COULD BE FRAMED THEY'RE VERY ARTISTIC LOOKING

A NASA SHIRT MAYBE ONE OF THE COMMEMORATIVE COINS FROM THE ATLANTIS ROLLOVER WHEN THEY MOVED IT TO THE DISPLAY AT KSC

EDIT FORMATTED
APART FROM OTHER PHYSICAL GIFTS TICKETS TO THE PLANETARIUM FOR THE FAMILY DDK IF YOU HAVE KIDS IF YES AND DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE IT COULD BE FUN IF ITS JUST THE TWO OF YOU IT SHOULD BE A NICE GESTURE HE MAY LIKE
THIS SITE WAS POSTED RECENTLY WITH SOME GREAT PRINTS AND INCLUDING SOME SPIFFY ONES I'M THINKING ABOUT A FEW OF THEM MYSELF
I'D GET A TELESCOPE JUST A 2 MIN AMAZON SEARCH SHOWS THAT YOU CAN GET DECENT STUFF IN THAT PRICE RANGE FOR EXAMPLE

NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST THE FIRST SHOPPING RESULT I HAVE FOUND I AM SURE THAT ON REDDIN EAST G R TELESCOPES WILL BE PEOPLE WHO CAN RECOMMEND YOU THE BEST ONE


TAKE HIM TO WATCH A LAUNCH IN PERSON EITHER AT CAPE CANAVERAL OR ANOTHER LAUNCH FACILITY GET A HOTEL FOR THE NIGHT AND MAKE A MINI VACATION OUT OF IT IM HOPING MY WIFE SEES THIS

EXPLANATION A SUPERMOON SETS OVER THE METROPOLIS OF PHILADELPHIA IN THIS TWILIGHT SNAPSHOT CAPTURED ON NOVEMBER AT AM EASTERN STANDARD TIME WITHIN HOURS OF THE EXACT FULL PHASE THAT TIME DOES CORRESPOND TO A LUNAR PERIGEE OR THE CLOSEST POINT IN THE ELLIPTICAL ORBIT AROUND OUR FAIR PLANET SLIGHTLY BIGGER AND BRIGHTER AT PERIGEE THIS FULL MOON IS STILL FLATTENED AND DISTORTED IN APPEARANCE BY REFRACTION IN ATMOSPHERIC LAYERS ALONG THE NEAR THE HORIZON ALSO LIKE MORE ORDINARY FULL MOONS IT SHINES WITH THE WARM COLOR OF SUNLIGHT JOINED BY BUILDINGS ALONG THE PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE THE PERIGEE FULL MOONLIGHT IS REFLECTED IN THE WATERS OF THE MIGHTY SCHUYLKILL RIVER
WHAT YOU HAVE CIRCLED IS THE SUN THE ONLY THING IN FRONT OF IT ARE CLOUDS PERHAPS YOU WERE CONFUSED BECAUSE THE SUN WASN'T AT THE BRIGHTEST SPOT IN THE SKY THAT CAN HAPPEN IF THE CLOUD COVER IS VERY UNEVEN AS IS THE CASE IN YOUR PICTURES WHILE THE SUN IS NEARLY OBSCURED SUNLIGHT CAN STREAM THROUGH THINNER CLOUDS NEARBY AND GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT'S THE SUN IS ELSEWHERE IN THE SKY
IF SOMETHING IS BETWEEN YOU AND THE SUN THEN YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE BACK UNLIT SIDE OF IT SO IT WOULD BASICALLY BE INVISIBLE ESPECIALLY DURING THE DAY WHEN THERE IS A NEW MOON AKA NO MOON THAT IS WHEN THE MOON IS BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE SUN

THAT IS MOST LIKELY DIRT OR SOMETHING ON THE LENS CAUSING SOME OPTICAL ARTIFACT
THOSE ARE CLOUDS

CLOUDS ARE NOT UNIFORM THICKNESS WHEN THEY PASS IN FRONT OF THE SUN IT DOES NOT DIM UNIFORMLY
JUST SAW THIS ARTICLE TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT GIVEN THE SOURCE

NEWS
MY YEAR OLD IS REALLY INTO SPACE AND SPACE EXPLORATION RIGHT NOW WE JUST STARTED WATCHING WHEN WE LEFT EARTH WHICH IS THE HISTORY OF THE NASA MANNED PROGRAM

IT'S AVAILABLE ON DISCOVERY RIGHT NOW AND SEEMS VERY WELL DONE WITH A LOT OF OLD VIDEO INCLUDING A LOT FROM THE MERCURY PROGRAM IN EPISODE
I REALLY NEED TO STOP TAKING FOR GRANTED THE FACT THAT ROCKET LAUNCHES HAPPEN ON A REGULAR BASIS ONLY HOURS AWAY

ON ANOTHER NOTE HOW ARE ALL THOSE CARS NOT STUCK IN THE SAND
OLD GUY HERE WHEN THE FIRST ASTRONAUTS FLEW INTO SPACE ALL OF US WERE GLUED IN FRONT OUR TV SETS AND STAYED THERE THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE MISSION I THINK INTEREST FADED BY THE GEMINI PROGRAM BUT SPIKED AGAIN IN FOR THE APOLLO FLIGHT IT WAS AN AMAZING TIME
SO DID PEOPLE BACK THEN WATCHING THIS THINK THAT WOW WE'RE IN THE FUTURE
I'VE BEEN READING THE RIGHT STUFF AND THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED THAT NAME GREAT READ ON THE TEST PILOTS WHO EVENTUALLY WENT ON TO BECOME THE FIRST ASTRONAUTS
UM ISN'T COCOA BEACH ON THE SAME ISLAND LAND MASS AS CAPE CANAVERAL
WHAT AN AWESOME PIC IS THAT THE FULL SIZE IMAGE WANT IT AS MY DESKTOP BACKGROUND HAHA
ALAN SHEPHARD WENT TO MEOU HIGH-SCHOOL IN DERRY NH PINKERTON ACADEMY THE CAFETERIA IS CALLED THE SHEPHARD BUILDING HE ALSO GREW UP HERE
AMAZING SHOT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER CROSSPOSTING THIS TO R SPACEFLIGHTPORN
IT'S WEIRD GROWING UP IN HOUSTON I GREW UP WITH SCOTT SON WENT TO THE SAME SCHOOL AND CHURCH LIKE MOST PEOPLE HERE WOULD OVER LOOK IT
I MAY BE THE ONLY ONE WITH THE BALLS TO ASK THIS BUT WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY

I JUST WANT TO PAY THE RESPECT I EVIDENTLY OWE HIM
IT'S SUPER WEIRD I HAD DEHYDRATED ICE CREAM THAT ASTRONAUTS EAT SORRY GUYS THAT'S ALL IVE GOT GREAT PIC THIS GUY IS THE REAL DEAL KIDS SHOULD LOOK UP TO AND BE A FAN OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS NOT PRO SPORTS PLAYERS AND MOVIE STARS THIS MAN HAS MADE A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE WORLD
I USED TO WORK AT JSC IN HOUSTON AND I SHARED AN ELEVATOR WITH RUSSELL YATES DURING ALL THE NEWS
NOW WHAT WOULD YOU USE TO SHOW ELON MUSK WHO'S THE REAL SUPERVILLAIN ON THE BLOCK

BOOF AND DIMETHYLMERCURY



IN PLASMA PROPULSION WE HAVE HAD SOME PRETTY FUN ONE TOO

MERCURY VERY DENSE AND EASY TO HANDLE AND STORE WITH GOOD PERFORMANCES IT WAS USED A LOT IN THE SOUTH ELEMENTAL MERCURY ISN'T THAT TOXIC IN ITSELF IF YOU DON'T BREATH ITS VAPOR ALL DAY LONG HOWEVER IT WILL AMALGAM WITH ALUMINIUM AND TURN YOUR SPACECRAFT INTO WET PASTE

LITHIUM USED IN SOME MPH NOT VERY FUN WHEN IT'S PULVERIZED ALL OVER YOUR TEST CHAMBER EDIT FOR THOSE WONDERING IT'S EXOTHERMIC ON CONTACT WITH WATER AND DUST DOES VERY NASTY THINGS TO YOU LUNGS AND EVEN SKIN

RADON IN THEORY IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ION THRUSTERS THAN XENON IT'S HEAVIER AND EASIER TO TURN INTO PLASMA THE ONLY SLIGHT ISSUE IS THAT IT IS RADIOACTIVE WITH A HALF LIFE OF DAYS FOR ITS MOST STABLE ISOTOPE IT'S REALLY EASY TO INHALE AND PRODUCE IONIZING RADIATION IT'S ALSO ABOUT PER

IODINE THIS ONE IS FAIRLY TAME IT TENDS TO CORRODE METALS AND ISN'T PARTICULARLY HEALTHY TO BREATH OR TOUCH THE FACT THAT YOU STORE IT AS AN UNPRESSURIZED SOLID IS VERY ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH IT
I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL ANY OF THESE WOULD COMPETE AGAINST ELON MUSK EVEN IF YOU COULD DISREGARD ALL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS STORAGE AND HANDLING OF SUCH TOXIC SUBSTANCES WOULD DRIVE YOUR COSTS WAY ABOVE RP AND LOX

NOT VERY USEFUL IF YOU WANT TO COMPETE

THAT BEING SAID NSW ALL THE WAY HIGH THRUST AND HIGH ESP ARE THE BEST
EVEN IF WE IGNORE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS WHICH HAS BEEN DRIVING OUT USE OF HIGHLY TOXIC PROPELLANTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES WORLDWIDE THE USE OF THESE HIGHLY TOXIC PROPELLANTS HAS A HUGE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THEM EAST G MANUFACTURING SHIPMENT HANDLING ETC WHICH MAY LARGELY NEGATE THE IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE IN A COMPETITIVE LAUNCH MARKET
ARCHIVE NASA HAS SOME FUN TRIPLE PROPELLANT ONES BERYLLIUM HYDROGEN OXYGEN BERYLLIUM HYDRAZINE NITROGEN TETROXIDE LITHIUM HYDROGEN FLORINE

IN THE S AND S THERE WAS THE IDEA OF USING BERYLLIUM AS AN ADDITIVE IN SOLID ROCKET FUEL

PROJECT PLUTO WAS A NUCLEAR RAMJET WHICH HAD DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE CORE AND EXHAUST

MY FAVORITE ONES ARE THE SOLID LIQUID AND GASEOUS CORE NUCLEAR THERMAL ROCKETS

WATER SUSPENSION OF URANIUM OR PLUTONIUM SALT ENRICHED ATOMIC MONOPROPELLANT FOR NUCLEAR SALT WATER ROCKETS FLOW ENOUGH OF IT INTO THE ENGINE CHAMBER TO ACHIEVE A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION KEEP FLOWING ENOUGH OF IT IN TO KEEP THE NUCLEAR EXPLOSION CONTINUOUS PROFIT TO QUOTE THE TITLE OF REPORT HIGH THRUST AT SEC ESP WHICH IS ION ENGINE LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY

I THINK I GOT A SEMI READING THAT

THERE IS ALSO THEORETICAL STUFF LIKE METASTABLE METALLIC HYDROGEN WHICH ONE DAY MIGHT ENTER THE LIST
THE CORRECT ANSWER ISN'T EVEN LISTED HERE

PROJECT ORION

TO BE CLEAR THIS ISN'T THE ANEMIC ORION THAT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE HEAT SHIELDS STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND A RETURN FROM MARS THIS IS THE ORIGINAL PROPELLED CONCEPT FROM THE USING A GIANT THE WELDED STEEL CONSTRUCTION IT COULD BE BUILT IN CONVENTIONAL SHIPYARDS MINIATURE CITY WOULD RIDE A SERIES OF SHAPED NUCLEAR EXPLOSIONS TO ORBIT AND BEYOND THE MORE MASS THE MORE EFFICIENT THE TRANSFER OF ENERGY TOO SO THE OPTIMAL SIZE WOULD TEND TOWARDS THE GIGANTIC

MANY SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT HAD THIS BEEN VIGOROUSLY PURSUED HUMANITY COULD HAVE BEEN VISITING SATURN BY THE

YOU WANT A NASTY AND EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR GETTING A LOT OF STUFF OFF THE GROUND DON'T THINK LITTLE TEENY ROCKETS THINK PUTT PUTT
THESE ARE UNPLEASANT I DOUBT THE EXTRA COSTS INVOLVED WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE PRACTICAL EVEN WITH NO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS SYNTAN IN PROBABLY THE CHEAPEST OF THESE AND THE SOVIETS ALREADY FOUND THAT TO BE TOO EXPENSIVE AND ENDED USE OF IT NOT LONG AFTER

I DOUBT THERES MUCH OF ANYTHING BETTER THAN METHALOX THATS VIABLE OUTSIDE A LABORATORY THERES OTHERS THAT HAVE BETTER ESP AND DENSITY BUT MOST ARE HIDEOUSLY TOXIC AS ABOVE REQUIRE HEAVY AND COMPLEX TANKAGE TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE PROPELLANTS SOME OF THEM EXTREMELY HOT COLD OR SOLID ARE WAY TOO EXPENSIVE EAT AWAY THE ENGINE RENDERING REUSE IMPOSSIBLE OR ALL
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE ARE ALL WORSE AND MORE EXPENSIVE THAN HYDROLOGY YOU HAVEN'T SOLVED ANY PROBLEMS AND YOU'VE CREATED A LOT MORE BETTER AND NASTIER ARE NOT SYNONYMS
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO LOX FOR THE MAIN LAUNCH SECTION FOR MANY MANY MANY REASONS ANYBODY THAT PAYS ATTENTION IS GOING TO SEE THE COMPARISONS OF THE NEW ENGINES FOR SPACE BLUE ORIGIN ULA THE OTHERS THEY ARE MUCH SMALLER WITH MUCH MORE THRUST VARIABLE THROTTLING FEWER COMPONENTS MORE MODULAR DESIGN AND MOST OF ALL LARGE DECREASE IN EXTREMELY HIGH SPEED TURBINES PRONE TO RANDOM FAILURE

ALONG WITH NASTY FUEL COMES NASTY HANDLING PLUS INCREASED HANDLING COMPLEXITY ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS SAFE RELIABLE QUICK ORBITAL INSERTION OF LARGE PAYLOADS THE PAYLOADS ARE WHAT BECOME SPACE CRAFT THEMSELVES WITH VARIOUS EXOTIC PROPULSION SYSTEMS
CHANGING THE CHEMISTRY OF ROCKET FUELS ONLY GIVES YOU A MARGINAL INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE THE RIGHT ANSWER IS TO STOP USING CHEMICAL ROCKETS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE AIR-BREATHING ENGINES HAVE MANY TIMES THE PERFORMANCE ALTHOUGH IT VARIES BY MACH NUMBER GROUND ACCELERATORS LIKE HYPERSONIC GAS GUNS AVOID USING ANY PROPELLANT UNTIL YOU LEAVE THE BARREL VARIOUS KINDS OF SPACE ELEVATORS CAN REPLACE PART OF THE ROCKET JOB WITH ELECTRIC PROPULSION THAT IS TEN TIMES AS EFFICIENT
IT WAS MY FIRST TRIP TO KSC AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY EVERYTHING I SAW THERE THE HEROES AND LEGENDS EXHIBIT IS REALLY WELL DONE WITH A LOT OF NEAT DISPLAYS INSIDE I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CHECKING IT OUT
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO WORK OUT WHAT KSC ACTUALLY WAS AFTER PLAYING ESP
HAD THIS BEEN AMERICA INSTEAD OF CHINA THEN THIS THREAD BEEN FULL OF ACTIVITY

WE SHOULD RENAME THIS SUB TO NASA INSTEAD SEEING AS MOST OF THE SUBSCRIBERS ACTIVELY DESPISE OTHER SPACE PROGRAMS
THIS MEANS CERES HAS A SUBSURFACE OCEAN WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY HARBOR LIFE
MAYBE THIS IS WHY CITY DWELLERS ARE OFTEN PERCEIVED AS ELITIST OR ARROGANT TOO MUCH LIGHT POLLUTION NO STARS TO OBSERVE NO INNER MONOLOGUE TO QUESTION THEIR SIGNIFICANCE THUS NO HUMBLING FACTOR TO TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME

EH WHAT DO I KNOW I JUST WOKE UP GOOD MORNING EVERYONE
HOW ABOUT THAT THERE IS NO UP YOU COULD JUST AS EASILY IMAGINE YOURSELF DANGLING ON GRAVITY LIKE A PAPERCLIP HANGING ON A MAGNET OVER AN INFINITE VOID
THIS SINGLE IMAGE DOES IT FOR ME EXPLANATION OF THE IMAGE CAN BE FOUND HERE
I AM ALWAYS MIND BOGGLED WHEN I LOOK UP AT THE MILKY WAY AND REALIZE THAT I AM OVERLOOKING THE ENTIRE PLANE OF THE GALAXY THERE IT IS THAT IS THE GALAXY RIGHT THERE
THATS WHY I LOVE TO DO IT AT LEAST A FEW TIMES A WEEK IT JUST KEEPS ME GROUNDED AND CLEARS MY HEAD OF ANY PETTY PROBLEMS IM HAVING THAT AND IT CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SCENERY TO LOOK AT
WHEN I LOOK UP I FEEL CONNECTED TO ALL THE HUMANS THAT HAVE EVER EXISTED WHO HAD A DESIRE TO LOOK UP AT THE NIGHT SKY I FEEL INSPIRED BY ALL OF THOSE WHO FIGURED OUT TINY LITTLE BITS OF IT OVER EONS TO GIVE ME THE WHOLE PICTURE OF WHAT I AM LOOKING AT WE MIGHT BE INSIGNIFICANT BUT GETTING TO THIS POINT OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE IS A PRETTY AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT IF YOU ASK ME
I LOVE KSC AND WHAT THEY DID WITH THE SHUTTLE DISPLAY I NEED TO GET BACK THERE SOON MAKES ME HOPEFUL WE MIGHT JUST MAKE IT OFF THIS ROCK BEFORE WE COMPLETELY DESTROY IT
GREAT PICTURE WITH AMAZING DETAILS IT BOGGLES MY MIND THAT THIS THING WAS BUILT AND FLEW FOR THE FIRST TIME MORE THAN YEARS AGO FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW IT STILL LOOKS SO FUTURISTIC
NOW LET'S LAUNCH THEM INTO SPACE ONE MORE TIME AND THROW THEM AWAY IN THE ATLANTIC

IT'S WORTH NOTING THOSE ARE NOT REAL THEY'RE JUST MOCK UPS EACH SHUTTLE EXHIBIT GOT ONE REAL IN THE CASE OF ATLANTIS IT WAS BEHIND YOU WHEN YOU TOOK THIS PICTURE
UNFORTUNATELY THOSE ARE ONLY FAKES AND THE REAL ONES ARE USED AND OR SOLD ELSE WHERE
POUNDS EACH THAT'S NEARLY AS MUCH THRUST AS I DELIVERED TO YOUR MOTHER LAST NIGHT
HUH IT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE SHE WAS TRIPPING OUT AFTER OVERDOSING ON SLEEPING PILLS THAT'S WHAT TOO MANY CAN DO TO YOU A BIT LIKE HAVING WAAAF TOO MUCH ALCOHOL BUT WITHOUT THE COGNITION LOSS
I WAS JUST HOPING FOR THE FIRST ACCOUNT OF SOMEONE GOING SPACE CRAZY
POPULAR HYPOTHESIS INCLUDE

COLLISION OF TWO 2D BANES IN STRING SPACE

SPECIAL BLACK HOLE HYPOTHESIS CERTAIN TYPES OF BLACK HOLES IN A UNIVERSE COULD CREATE 3D UNIVERSES

QUANTUM FOAM HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE WE DON'T LIVE IN THE UNIVERSE BUT RATHER ON THE TOPOLOGICAL SURFACE

BIG BOUNCE THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS AND CONTRACTS AGAIN IN CYCLES

COMPUTER SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS WE ARE LIVING IN SIMULATED UNIVERSE

AND OF COURSE THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE WAYS UNIVERSES CAN FORM

SOME OF THE ABOVE CAN BE PROBED TO SEE IF THEY HAVE BASIS AND IN SOME CASES SUCH EXPERIMENTS ARE UNDERWAY
BEFORE THE BIG BANG THE UNIVERSE DIDN'T EXIST THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE IN A SINGULARITY TIME AND SPACE DID NOT ACTUALLY EXIST UNTIL THE SINGULARITY EXPANDED

HOW AND WHY THE SINGULARITY EXPANDED IS STILL A QUESTION BUT EVEN THAT QUESTION IS MUDDLED BY THE WAY WE ASK IT IF WE ASK WHY THEN THAT IMPLIES THERE IS CONSCIOUSNESS AND MEANING AND INTENT THE GOD THEORY IF WE ASK HOW THAT IMPLIES THERE ARE ONGOING MECHANISMS AND THOSE MECHANISMS REQUIRE TIME TO EXIST AND TIME DIDN'T EXIST SO REALLY ASKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED PRE BIG BANG IS A QUESTION THAT DOESN'T JUST HAVE NO ANSWER THE QUESTION ITSELF IS MEANINGLESS TIME BEGAN WITH THE BIG BANG WITHOUT TIME EXISTING YOU CAN'T ASK WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE

IF THAT'S CONFUSING JUST THINK ABOUT A BIG BOWL FULL OF STUFF
CHALK IT UP TO THE WEAK ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE IF THE UNIVERSE DIDN'T EXIST WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TO ASK HOW CAN THE UNIVERSE EXIST SO NO MATTER HOW UNLIKELY THE ODDS OF IT JUST EXISTING THE FACT THAT WE ASK THE QUESTION SHOWS THAT IT DOES
I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THERE HAVE TO BE A REASON MAYBE THE UNIVERSE JUST CAME INTO BEING WITHOUT A CAUSE
THE MOST SATISFYING ANSWER TO ME AT LEAST IS THAT NOTHING IS AN INHERENTLY UNSTABLE STATE NOTHING TAKES ENERGY SOMETHING IS MORE STABLE ERGO WE HAVE SOMETHING
BASICALLY THERE WAS A BIG BANG THEN THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS TO A CERTAIN POINT AND IMPLODES CAUSING ANOTHER BIG BANG THAT WAS MENT TO BE ONE POST BUT I HAVE CLUMSY FINGERS
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT THEORY BUT ISN'T IT SOMETHING ABOUT IT ALWAYS EXISTING AND THERE BEING MULTIPLE BIG BANGS BASICALLY
I THINK THAT AS LONG AS ITS NOT JUST SOME SINGLE CELLED THING THAT THE WORLD WILL GO CRAZY EVEN THEN THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY WILL GO CRAZY OVER IT
WHAT WOULD YOUR REACTION BE A TO A SPECIES THAT HAS SENT OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE EXTINCT ONE THAT HAS DESPOILED ITS ENVIRONMENT MAINLY JUST FOR THE PURPOSE OF POINTLESS WARS

I THINK WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE ARE EVEN WORTH CONTACTING
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT WE WILL FIND OCEANIC LIFE IN A SALINE WATER POCKET UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE OF A MOON OF JUPITER IT'LL PROBABLY BE SIMILAR TO EARTHLY ALGAE OR IF IT'S GROWING NEAR A GEOTHERMAL VENT TUBULAR OR WEEDY SCIENCE FICTION WON'T DO IT JUSTICE

EVENTUALLY FAR FAR INTO THE FUTURE HUMANITY WILL ENCOUNTER MORE ALIEN LIFE FORMS WE CAN ANTICIPATE CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS SOME PART OF THEM WILL PROBABLY VIBRATE TO PRODUCE SOUNDS SOME PART OF THEM WILL VERY LIKELY BE SENSITIVE TO LIGHT PROBABLY NOT OUR VISIBLE WAVELENGTHS THOUGH THEY WILL LIKELY HAVE SOME MUSCULATURE TO MOVE AND SOMETHING HARD TO HOLD THE SQUISHY BITS TOGETHER THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOME MEASURE OF SYMMETRY AND OR REMNANTS OF SEGMENTATION BOTH OF WHICH WERE CONDUCIVE TO THE SUCCESS OF EARLY LIFE ON EARTH THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME SORT OF INFORMATION PROCESSING STRUCTURE GENERIC STUFF BUT WITHIN THAT THERE ARE HUGE AMOUNTS OF VARIATION TAKE ANY ONE OF THOSE AND TRY TO LIST ALL THE EARTHLY EXAMPLES THEN IMAGINE ANY NUMBER OF OTHER BIOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES
IF THE ALIENS ARE SMART ENOUGH TO REACH US THEN THEY WILL KNOW ROBOTICS IF THE ALIENS SHARE OUR CURIOSITY THEN THEY WILL HAVE SENT ROBOTS TOO

I THINK THE FIRST THING WE FIND WILL NOT BE LIFE REPLICATING CELLULAR LIFE BUT RATHER SOMETHING THAT EVIDENCES ADVANCED SENTIENT LIFE EXISTING


SHEER PROBABILITY DICTATES THAT WE'RE MORE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER UNICELLULAR LIFE OR EQUIVALENT THEREOF
EP PREDICTS THAT ALIEN LIFE WILL LOOK LIKE LIFE ON EARTH
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ALIEN LIFE THAT WE FIND WILL BE PROCARYOTIC AND SIMILAR TO EXTREMOPHILES THAT WE FIND ON EARTH THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY WOULD GO ABSOLUTELY NUTS THOUGH AND IT WOULD STILL BE A MASSIVE DISCOVERY
IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT IF AN ALIEN SPECIES HAD THE TECHNOLOGY TO GET TO US THEY WOULD ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DESTROY US STEPHEN HAWKING FEELS THIS WAY AND HAS BEEN THEORIZING ON THIS FOR YEARS

THIS DOES NOT SPEAK TO MOTIVATIONS BEHIND FINDING US COMING HERE THOUGH JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN DOESN'T MEAN THEY WILLIAM WE CAN NEVER ACCURATELY JUDGE THEIR MOTIVATIONS AS THEY ARE ALIEN NOT HUMAN AND HUMAN MOTIVATIONS ARE ALL WE KNOW

HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE ARE IT'S EXCITING TO THINK ABOUT IF IT CAME TO IT I HOPE WE LEARN FROM EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DESTROY THEM OUT OF FEAR OR THEM JUST COME DOWN AND DESTROY US
WELL I THINK IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPREHEND WHAT ANY MACROSCOPIC ALIEN LIFE WOULD LOOK LIKE IF IT FOLLOWED A DIFFERENT EVOLUTIONARY PATH FROM A DIFFERENT SOURCE IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT IT WOULDN'T REPRESENT ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN
FINALLY SOME HOPE FOR FIXING MY CRAPPY INTERNET SPEED LIVING IN A RURAL AREA

I'VE SERIOUSLY CONTEMPLATED MOVING JUST FOR BETTER INTERNET
PREMIUM SATELLITE INTERNET PLAN FOR MORE IT WILL FOLLOW THE ROTATION TO STAY ON TOP OF YOUR HOUSE
I'M CAN SOMEONE HELP ME

WHEN SATELLITES ARE IN ORBIT HOW DO THEY KEEP WITH ONE PLACE ON EARTH MY QUESTION COMES FROM THEM MENTIONING THE FIRST WOULD BE FOR THE US SO I AM WONDERING HOW THEY KEEP THOSE WITHIN RANGE DO THEY USE GPS GUIDANCE IS IT NATURAL FOR THEM TO KEEP UP AT THAT DISTANCE DOES IT NOT MATTER WHERE AROUND THE EARTH THE SATELLITES ARE THEY SOMEHOW ONLY GET BACK TO THE US
TO ENSURE ROBOTS DON'T END UP USING ACCESS TO THE INTERNET TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD THE SATELLITES SHOULD ONLY PASS OVER DURING THE DAY AT NIGHT A GAP IN THE SATELLITES WOULD NO LONGER PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS
OF THE PLANETS POPULATION IS COVERED WITH BROADBAND OF BILLION IS I GUESS THAT IS PRETTY GOOD

BUT SATELLITES IS MORE THAN TWICE ALL THE SATELLITES IN ORBIT NOW AND THEY HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY REFRESHED EVERY FIVE YEARS SATELLITES A WEEK FOREVER

I SUPPOSE IF YOU COULD NOT SELL THE USED ROCKETS TO CUSTOMERS THEN YOU COULD USE THEM YOURSELF THAT'S FOR SURE

HE DOES HAVE A LOT OF LAND OVER THERE AT THE FREMONT PLANT MORE THAN ENOUGH ROOM TO MAKE CAR SIZED SATELLITES

I'M THINKING THE ODDS ARE LONG

THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF SETTING UP FISH FARMS ON MARS WHICH WOULD BE FED ALGAE AND INSECTS AND WOULD BE A WELCOME SOURCE OF MEAT BUGS ARE NUTRITIOUS BUT I'M CERTAIN THEY'D GET BORING PRETTY QUICKLY BEING ABLE TO HAVE SOME FRIED FISH NOW AND THEN WILL KEEP COLONISTS HAPPIER

DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PHOTO ACTUALLY BEING TAKEN DURING EARTHRISE AS OPPOSED TO EARTHSET I'M JUST CURIOUS AND WOULD LOVE TO KNOW MORE

HERE'S THE FIRST PICTURE HETP OF THE EARTH FROM THE VICINITY OF THE MOON WHICH WAS ALSO TAKEN BY LUNAR ORBITER BUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ORBITER THE EARTH WAS SETTING ACCORDING TO THE DIAGRAM ON THIS PAGE
BACK WHEN EARTH WAS STILL BLACK AND WHITE

I WONDER WHEN WE ARE FINALLY GONNA COLORIZE THE MOON
NICE MY STONED ASS ZOOMED WAY IN AND I THOUGHT WHOA YOU CAN SEE THE EQUATOR

I FACEPALMED WHEN I REALIZED A THE OBVIOUS THERE IS NO VISIBLE EQUATOR LINE LIKE IN GLOBE MAPS AND B THERE'S LINES THROUGH THE WHOLE PHOTO
SOURCE BACKSTORY
JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE ROTATIONAL PERIOD ALMOST EXACTLY MATCHES ITS ORBITAL PERIOD SO THERE WOULDN'T REALLY BE AN EARTHRISE OR EARTHSET JUST DIFFERENT VIEWS OF EARTH DEPENDING ON YOUR LOCATION ON THE MOON
AND THERE IT WAS EARTH NOT AS THE MAP MAKER WOULD HAVE YOU IDENTIFY IT BUT AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN EARTHRISE OVER THE LUNAR LANDSCAPE
UM IS NO ONE ELSE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT LITTLE FACE IN THE CRATER THAT LOOKS LIKE JACK SKELLINGTON WTF
ISN'T THE MOON TIDALLY LOCKED SO SURELY THERE IS NO NATURAL EARTH RISE UNLESS YOU ARE ORBITING THE MOON I KNOW THIS PICTURE IS FROM ORBIT I'M JUST ASKING THIS QUESTION BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE A COOL ANSER THAT SOMEONE MIGHT KNOW THANKS
GREAT PHOTO I HOPE ALL THE OTHER FANS OF THE OFFICE ARE THINKING ABOUT GABES EXPERIMENTAL SONG TITLED EARTH RISE ON THE MOON
I LOVE THE OLD FILM QUALITY IT ADDS SO MUCH TOO THE FEELING OF HISTORY AND MAJESTY
WHAT'S THE SCALE IF THESE CRATERS ON MOON FOR INSTANCE THE HUGE ONE NEAR THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER HOW BIG IS IT COMPARATIVE TO CITIES OR STATES
HOW ARE THE STARS IN THE PHOTO MODERN SPACE PHOTOS DON'T HAVE STARS IN THEM BECAUSE OF NO EXPOSURE OR SOMETHING WHY ARE THERE STARS HERE CLEARLY VISIBLE
THE MOON LOOKS LIKE LITTLE BROTHER THAT HIT PUBERTY HARD AND NEVER GOT HIS ACNE UNDER CONTROL AND ENDED UP WITH POCK MARKS IT'S OKAY THOUGH HE'S GOT A SWEET PERSONALITY AND WE LOVE HIM
I'M GUESSING THIS IS A COMPOSITE BASED ON THE LINES AND THE NUMBERS ON THE LEFT IS IT LONG STRIPS OF HORIZONTAL FILM OR SQUARES
REALLY MAKES YOU THINK ALL HUMANS WHO HAVE EVER LIVED DID SO ON THAT BALL OVER THERE ALL LIFE THAT WE KNOW OF DOGS AND DINOSAURS AND BEARS AND MEGALODON IT'S AMAZING HOW THOUSANDS OF SPECIES EVOLVED FROM THE SIMPLEST LIFE ALL ON THAT ONE PLANET FROM THE OCEAN WE CAME AND NOW LOOK AT US AFTER MILLIONS OF YEARS HERE WE ARE HERE YOU ARE A WONDERFUL DESCENDANT OF THAT WONDROUS TRANSFORMATION A DESCENDANT OF THE FISH OF THE MICROBES OF THE STARS

HOW COME THE EARTH LOOK SO SMALL THE EARTH IS MUCH LARGER COMPARED TO THE MOON SHOULDNT IT LOOK GREATER IN THE SKY FROM THE MOON
HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF ALL THOSE FLAT EARTH THEORIES THEY ARE SO FUTZ I LIKE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON STUFF BUT UGH

SO DOES THE EARTH RISE DURING THE NIGHT OR DAYTIME ALONG WITH THE SUN DOES THE MOON EVEN HAVE DAY NIGHT CYCLES TO BEGIN WITH IT HAS TO RIGHT MY HEAD HURTS NOW
THERE IS NO EARTH RISE NOR SET ON THE MOON SINCE IT ALWAYS FACES THE EARTH WITH THE SAME SIDE
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT PICTURES OF EARTH TAKEN FROM THE SAME POINT THE MOON AND THE EARTH IS ALMOST ALWAYS A DIFFERENT SIZE
BUT IF EARTH LOOKS ALIKE MOON FROM THE MOON DOESN'T THAT MEAN EARTH IS JUST AS LARGE AS THE MOON

QUESTION THE HORIZONTAL LINES ON THE PHOTOGRAPH ARE THEY A RESULT OF HOW THE IMAGE WAS TAKEN
I FIRST READ VIDEO INSTEAD OF PHOTO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT
QUESTION OF THE DAY SEEING THAT THE EARTH IS THE SIZE OF THE MOON WHY WOULD EARTH APPEAR SO SMALL COMMON SENSE WOULD SAY THAT EARTH WOULD APPEAR HUGE FROM THE MOON EARTH IS THE SIZE OF THE MOON SO FROM THE MOON EARTH WOULD APPEAR LARGER THAN WE SEE THE MOON FROM EARTH BUT NO PICTURES EVER SHOW THAT
FIRST EVER EARTHRISE VIDEO
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY THERE IS SO MUCH VERTICAL SPACE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE MOON WHEN WE SEE SUNRISE OR MOONRISE IT'S RIGHT AT THE HORIZON I'M HAVING TROUBLE WRAPPING MY BRAIN AROUND WHY THERE IS SO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO OBJECTS IS THAT THE SHADOW ON THE EARTH THESE PROBABLY SEEM LIKE DUMB QUESTIONS BUT I HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH COFFEE TODAY AND AM HAVING TROUBLE
THIS ONE IS CALLED EARTHRISE ON THE MOON GABE TO ANDY


ANY OFFICE FANS EDH EDH
THE EARTH IS SO TINY COMPARED TO THE MOON LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING AT TIMES
ARM ISN'T THE SAME FACE OF THE MOON ALWAYS FACING THE EARTH NO DAILY ROTATION WOULD NOT ALLOW TO HAVE THE EARTH RISE THOUGH IF YOU DIDN'T DIE FROM FREEZING OR MELTING YOU'D GET TO SEE THE EARTH GO THROUGH A DAY IF YOU WANTED TO ONCE EVERY DAYS YOU'D GET A SUNRISE SUNSET CYCLE ON THE MOON

I MISREAD THE TITLE INITIALLY AND THOUGHT THIS PHOTO WAS FROM PLUTO AND I WAS VERY CONFUSED THAT WE'D SENT A PROBE TO PLUTO AT ALL PLUS WHY THE EARTH WAS SO BIG AND YET JUPITER WAS AWOL
PER BEN WEBSITE HETP UPDATES MAY ALSO BE FOUND FOR SOME LAUNCHES ON A SCANNER AT A LOCAL RADIO REPEATER WHICH REBROADCASTS THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH COVERAGE AUDIO THIS MAY ALSO BE ON A DELAY DEPENDING ON THE LAUNCH

IT'S PRETTY COOL THAT THERES A CURRENCY WHICH SHOWS ANOTHER PLANET'S LANDSCAPE ON IT

IT FEELS VERY UNIFYING TO ME IN A WEIRD WAY
IS THIS ONE OF THE BANKNOTES THAT ARE BEING RECALLED BY THE GOVERNMENT
DELETED
IT SOUNDS A BIT LIKE A LOT OF ASTEROIDS AND SPACE DEBES FLYING BY THE AUDIO SENSOR VERY QUICKLY
BUT COMPARABLY IN SOME SPOTS IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE A DISHWASHER OR WINDSHIELD WIPERS
ALSO WHAT YOU HEAR WHEN YOU PLAYBACK AUDIO FROM A MIC WITHOUT A POP FILTER
SOUNDS LIKE A PAPER BAG CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND THE RECORDED AUDIO REVERSED AND SPED UP
SO WHAT IS THIS SOUND REPRESENTING IN SPACE WHERE DO YOU GET IT FROM
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT SPACE PLANS TO DO WITH THESE DEAD SATELLITES ONCE THE YEAR ENDS
THERE'S SOME GREAT SPECULATION OVER AT R SPACE WHERE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THIS STUFF ARE LOOKING THIS COMMENT IN PARTICULAR DOES A PRETTY GOOD BREAKDOWN OF CAPABILITIES THAT SPACE CURRENTLY HAS IT TAKES A BIT OF AN OPTIMISTIC APPROACH BUT IT GETS THE POINT ACROSS SPACE CAN AND WILL DO THIS IT'S TOO PROFITABLE FOR THEM NOT TO
I CAN SEE THIS QUICKLY TURNING INTO A SATELLITE DEBRIS CATASTROPHE MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY TO TAKE JUNK DOWN WITH EVERY NEW LAUNCH

WHERE WAS THIS BEFORE I SPENT FOR A PLANT TO MY HOUSE
YEAH MUSK HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR SOME TIME NOW THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S DROPPED ANYTHING RESEMBLING ACTUAL DETAILS

SO AT LEAST WE KNOW THE WORLD WILL HAVE GLOBAL NET SERVICE

SEE THERE ARE ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH HIS CUNNING PLAN WHEN HE FIRST STARTED BLATHERING ABOUT THIS I THOUGHT HOLY ARAK FOUR THOUSAND SATELLITES THAT'S HALF THE NUMBER OF THINGS WE'VE EVER LAUNCHED INTO SPACE SINCE THE AND IT'S FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER OF CURRENTLY ACTIVE SATELLITES HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY DO THAT

AHA THINKS I THEY'RE GOING TO BE LITTLE TEENSY SO HE CAN LAUNCH DOZENS AT ONCE

NOPE

EACH SATELLITE IN PLANNED CONSTELLATION WILL WEIGH ABOUT POUNDS
OR KILOGRAMS AND BE ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A MINI COOPER CAR

FOUR THOUSAND FULL-SIZED COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES AND JUST WHERE DOES HE PLAN TO GET THE TENS TO HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO THIS SELLING HIS GLOBAL INTERNET SERVICE

WELL A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS THERE

FIRST OFF ALTHOUGH HE CALLS THIS GLOBAL INTERNET SERVICE YOU WILL NEED AN ANTENNA ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A SATELLITE TV PIZZA DISH TO USE IT SO YOU KNOW FORGET ABOUT USING YOUR LAPTOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GOBI DESERT SURE YOU COULD HAVE A WIFI SYSTEM THAT USES THE ATS AS ITS BACKBONE IF SOMEBODY COUGHED UP THE MONEY TO BUILD IT

AND THEN THERE'S THE LATENCY PROBLEM EVEN WITH YOUR ANTENNA YOU'RE STILL SENDING SIGNALS A SIGNIFICANT DISTANCE INTO SPACE AND BACK PLUS PROCESSING TIMES LATENCY IS GOING TO BE A BIG PROBLEM FORGET ABOUT PLAYING YOUR AMMO GAME OR SKYING VIP THAT KINDA THING AND AS SYSTEMS BOOST BANDWIDTH AND LOWER LATENCY PEOPLE WILL COME UP WITH NEW WAYS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND BY THE TIME MUSK IS EVEN OF THE WAY TO PUTTING HIS GRAND SPACE ARMADA IN PLACE IT WILL BE OBSOLETE

AND THE DEBRIS PROBLEM THIS WILL GENERATE I DON'T EVEN WANNA THINK ABOUT IT


THEY SHOULD ALSO TABLE A PLAN TO CLEAN THEM UP SHOULD THEIR COMPANY GO UNDER OR THEY BECOME OBSOLETE
WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY LOW LATENCY THE DISTANCE JUST TO BOUNCE OFF A SATELLITE AT THEIR LOWEST ORBIT OF IS THE SAME AS THE LATENCY TO CROSS THE PACIFIC THAT'S JUST ONE HOP WHILE THIS IS FINE FOR COMMUNICATIONS IT ISN'T USABLE FOR REAL TIME APPLICATIONS OR GAMING
WE NEED SOME MORE JUNK UP THERE WOULDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO GET THROUGH THAT WALL OF CRAP
I LIKE THIS SUCCESS RATE MAKES ME HAPPY TO THINK THAT THE AWST WILL LAUNCH WITH AN ARIANE
DEPENDS QUITE A NICE SET I'D SELFISHLY KEEP THEM

IF NOT I'D EITHER DONATE THEM TO SOME PLACE THAT WOULD BE THRILLED TO HAVE THEM LIKE THE EVERGREEN AVIATION SPACE MUSEUM JUST BECAUSE IT'S NEAR ME FIND ONE YOU LIKE OR GET THEM AUTHENTICATED THROUGH SOMEONE LIKE PSA
AND THEN EITHER PUT THEM ON EBAY OR AN AUCTION SITE

ONE THING I WOULDN'T DO IS PART THEM OUT THAT'S A REALLY NICE SET GOT DEKE ALAN GUS ALL THE ONES PEOPLE WOULD LOOK FOR GUS ESPECIALLY AS HE DIED ON THE PAD ON THE FIRST APOLLO MISSION AND THERE'S LIKELY NOT A TON OF SIGNED STUFF FROM HIM
WOULD SUGGEST A MUSEUM I KNOW THAT THE MUSEUM OF FLIGHT IN SEATTLE WOULD LOVE THEM I LEAVE NEAR BY AND THESE WOULD BE COOL TO SEE IN PERSON BUT IF NOT KEEP THEM AND DON'T SELL THEM THAT IS SOME AWESOME HISTORY
WATCHING RIGHT NOW


SO GLAD THE LAUNCH IS A SUCCESS I HOPE THE RENDEZVOUS WITH THE ISS WILL BE SMOOTH TOO
EDIT WRONG TOPIC MY MISTAKE




GOOD
VERY SIMPLE STUFF DARK ENERGY GRAVITATIONAL WASTE
WHAT'S THE LATENCY I USE TO HAVE SAT INTERNET AND I HAD A MS PING
AND ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS MAKING THE ORBITAL DEBRIS ENVIRONMENT EVEN WORSE
THEY TOOK QUITE A BIG STEP AWAY FROM IT WHEN THAT ROCKET BLEW UP ON THE LAUNCHPAD TAKING A SATELLITE DESIGNED IN PART TO DO JUST THAT WITH IT
THE ISS IS OLDER THAN A DECADE IT'S FIRST BIT WAS FLOWN IN THIS MAKES THE ISS YEARS OLD

TO ANSWER YOUR FIRST QUESTION IT WILL POSSIBLY BE REPLACED BUT EXACTLY WHAT NOBODY REALLY KNOWS OR IF IT WILL BE REPLACED AT ALL AT LEAST AS AN INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ANYWAY BUT NOT REPAIRED TO KEEP IT UP FOREVER

THE ISS CAN BE REPAIRED IN SPACE PROVIDED PARTS ARE SENT UP JUST LIKE IT WAS BUILT JUST REPLACE THE BITS THAT NEED REPLACING HOWEVER THE MAIN CORE UNITS THAT WERE PUSHED UP IN THE SHUTTLES OR OTHER MEANS THOSE AREN'T GETTING REPLACED JUST PARTS AND SMALL

PLANNED END OF MISSION IS IN WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH IT IS COMPLICATED
NASA FUNDING FOR ISS GETS CUT TO ZERO IN THE PLAN LAST YEAR WAS TO LET IT BURN UP IN FUNDING WAS EXTENDED TO THE RUSSIANS HAVE SAID THEY WILL BE SEPARATING THEIR MAIN MODULES BEFORE THEN AND BUILD THEIR OWN STATION THIS IS WITH TWO LARGE MODULES STILL PLANNED TO BE ADDED BEHIND SCHEDULE NASA IS COMPLETELY OUT OF LOW EARTH ORBIT LEO THEY GOT ADDITIONAL FUNDING THIS YEAR TO EXPLORE DEEP SPACE HABITATS SO TWO LARGER BIGELOW SECTIONS ARE PLANNED FOR THE ISS IN A COUPLE YEARS THOSE BIGELOW MAY BE DETACHED FROM THE ISS IN WHEN A COMMERCIAL MAIN MODULE MAY BE AROUND NASA HAS TURNED OVER LEO TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND ENCOURAGED PRIVATE ENTERPRISE TOURISM RESEARCH PRODUCTS FROM ORBIT THE ISS IS REQUIRING A LOT OF MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP PLUS ADDING MORE AND MORE ON THERE ARE MANY SPACE WALKS BEING MADE EVERY YEAR HARDLY GIVEN ANY NEWS NOTICE THE LAST SPACE WALK WAS TO PUT THE STANDARDIZED COMMERCIAL DOCKING PORT RING ON A MODULE THAT WILL BE THE STANDARDIZED DOCKING PORT FOR SPACE DRAGON AND BOEING STALLINGER CREW CAPSULES
THE BIGGER PROBLEMS ORIGINATE FROM GENERAL STRUCTURAL FAILURE EVENTUALLY PARTS TOO BIG TO BE DELIVERED IN A DRAGON'S TRUNK ARE GOING TO BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN MIR WAS A NIGHTMARE TOWARDS THE END OF HER SERVICE

IT APPEARS THAT ROSCOSMOS AND NASA ARE TALKING ABOUT ISS 2 AND ISS IN LOW LUNAR AND HIGHLY ELLIPTICAL LUNAR ORBITS RESPECTIVELY
AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THERE'S NO CLEAR ANSWER BUT GIVEN NASA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CLEAR PUSH TOWARD ALLOWING PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO HANDLE LEO OPERATIONS I WOULD SPECULATE HOPE THAT INDUSTRY WILL BUILD A NEXT GENERATION SPACE STATION AND LEASE OUT SPACE TO GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE SPACE AGENCIES THIS IS ONE OF GOALS


I HADN'T SEEN THIS ONE BEFORE THIS MIGHT BE AN EVEN BETTER DEMONSTRATION OF LIGHT ECHOS THAN MONOCEROTIS
ORIGINAL SOURCE

THIS TIME-LAPSE WAS TAKEN BY HUBBLE OVER WEEKS BACK IN

RS PUPPIS IS A CEPHEID CLASS STAR WITH A LUMINOSITY THAT VARIES BY A FACTOR OF ALMOST OVER A PERIOD OF DAYS
CISLUNAR PRIVILEGE IS HAVING YOUR OWN SUBREDDIT WHEN US TRANSLUNAR HAVE NOTHING
SINCE YOU SEEM TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF FLAIRS AND PLANETS UNLIKE OTHERS THAT ASK SIMILAR QUESTIONS HERE I CAN ONLY SUGGEST IT'S A SEARCH LIGHT PERHAPS DID YOU CHECK HEAVENS ABOVE FOR PASSING SATELLITES


ARE YOU NEAR ANY MILITARY BASES THAT MAY DROP FLAIRS ON PARACHUTES

EDIT AFTER LOOKING AT THE PICTURE THERE'S NO OTHER STARS IN I CAN SEE WHICH LEADS ME TO THINK ITS MORE MAN MADE AND IN THE ATMOSPHERE
I THINK IT'S VENUS IT'S INCREDIBLY BRIGHT IN THE SOUTHWESTERN SKY SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET RIGHT NOW THE POSITION IN THE SKY AND THE TIME YOU GAVE MATCH UP PERFECTLY
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT VENUS ISN'T THAT VERY BRIGHT VENUS IS BRIGHTER THAN JUPITER AND MARS

IT'S SLOWLY SETTING IN A WESTWARD DIRECTION AND IT'S REALLY BRIGHT IT'S VENUS DUDE
VENUS IS BAR THE MOON THE BRIGHTEST OBJECT IN THE NIGHT SKY FOR A GOOD PORTION OF ITS ORBIT WHY WOULD YOU THINK ITS TOO BRIGHT TO BE VENUS
IT'S VENUS VENUS IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND BRIGHTEST OBJECT IN THE NIGHT SKY FAR BRIGHTER THEN SATURN
IF YOU'RE SURE VENUS HAD SET THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GUESS MARS WHICH I NOTICED THE OTHER NIGHT IS PARTICULARLY BRIGHT RIGHT NOW AND IN THE RIGHT GENERAL AREA AT THAT TIME
BINGO YEP CROSSING ORBITS MOST OF THE ISS IMPACTS COME FROM TO DEGREES OFF THE VELOCITY VECTOR EVEN PEOPLE ON THE PROGRAM GET CONFUSED BY THIS THERE IS A SPOT ON THE TRUSS BEHIND THE LP THAT PEOPLE EXPECT TO BE PROTECTED BY THE STRUCTURE BUT THE DEBRIS COMES FROM OFF SIDES SO BEING BEHIND THE LP IS ACTUALLY WORSE FOR DEBRIS RISK CHECK OUT HETP WHICH SHOWS THE TRACKED OBJECTS LIVE
YOU'RE RIGHT IF THE TWO OBJECTS WERE IN EXACTLY THE SAME ORBIT THEY WOULD NEVER COLLIDE IF THEY WERE IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ORBITS THEIR RELATIVE VELOCITY WOULD BE VERY SMALL AND THE IMPACTS WOULD NOT BE SO SEVERE

WHILE I'M NOT SURE IF ANY OF THOSE IMPACTS ARE RECORDED FOR ALL I KNOW THEY MIGHT BE BUT THEY AREN'T WORTH REPORTING IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THE HIGH-VELOCITY IMPACTS OCCUR BECAUSE THE DEBRIS IS NOT IN THE SAME ORBIT IF FOR EXAMPLE THE DEBRIS AND THE ISS WERE BOTH ORBITING THE EARTH AT PRECISELY THE SAME ALTITUDE A PERFECTLY CIRCULAR ORBIT BUT ONE WAS IN A POLAR ORBIT AND ONE WAS IN AN EQUATORIAL ORBIT YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY SEE THAT THE IMPACT WILL BE AT ORBITAL VELOCITY NOW THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SCENARIO HERE BUT IF YOU REDUCE THE DIFFERENCE IN INCLINATION YOU'LL STILL HAVE A HIGH-VELOCITY IMPACT UNTIL YOU REDUCE THE INCLINATION TO NEAR ZERO THEN YOU CAN START TO CONSIDER OBJECTS THAT AREN'T IN THE SAME ORBITAL SPACE BUT INSTEAD SIMPLY PASS THROUGH IT SAY FOR EXAMPLE A GEOSTATIONARY TRANSFER ORBIT SO ON AND SO FORTH

IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT A BULLET CAN TRAVEL AT SPEEDS AROUND METERS PER SECOND ORBITAL VELOCITY IS ON THE ORDER OF METERS PER SECOND IF YOU GET A PAINT FLECK MOVING AT ONLY THE ORBITAL VELOCITY RELATIVE TO THE SPACE STATION IT'S GOING TO BE DAMAGING AND IS NOT A LOT
I THINK WE ALWAYS LAUNCH ROCKETS IN THE SAME DIRECTION TO HAVE THE SMALL BOOT FROM THE EARTH ROTATION

EXCEPT FOR ISRAEL THOSE GUYS LAUNCH RETROGRADE I EAST WESTWARD

WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IN THIS CASE IS THE FACT THAT IS THE SCREW OR SMALL PIECE OF SATELLITE JUNK IS ABLE TO COLLIDE THE ISS IT MEANS IT HAS THE SAME ALTITUDE AND IF IT HAS THE SAME ALTITUDE IT MEANS THEY ARE GOING AT THE SAME SPEED SO THE SPEED BETWEEN THE SPACE JUNK AND THE SATELLITE ISS WHATEVER SHOULD BE VERY CLOSE TO

YOU'RE ASSUMING IDENTICAL INCLINATION AND IDENTICAL ECCENTRICITY NOT ALL ORBITS ARE CIRCULAR AND THEY AREN'T IN THE SAME PLANE SO IMAGINE ISS IN ITS LOW ORBIT AT O INCLINATION AND YOU'VE GOT A BUNCH OF SCREWS RELEASED BY AN OLD SOVIET MOLNIYA SATELLITE THAT HAD AN INCLINATION OF O AND IS COMING DOWN FROM ITS APOGEE OF KM NOT KM AS YOU CAN GUESS BY THE TIME IT FALLS TO THE LOW POINT IN ITS ORBIT IT'S GOING TO BE MOVING AT ABOUT TWICE THE VELOCITY OF THE ISS THERE ARE PLENTY OF SATELLITES IN FULL POLAR ORBITS O INCLINATION

HERE'S AN EXAMPLE IN IRIDIUM AND COSMOS RAMMED INTO EACH OTHER HERE'S A MAP
WHAT WOULD AN APOLLO ASTRONAUT DO HE D DRINK THREE WHISKEY SOURS DRIVE HIS CORVETTE TO THE LAUNCHPAD THEN FLY TO THE MOON IN A COMMAND MODULE SMALLER THAN MY ROVER MAN THOSE GUYS WERE COOL

ANDY WEIR THE MARTIAN
I KINDA WISH THEY HAD A SHAPE SORTING TOY AND ONE OF THEM WAS TRYING TO PUT THE SQUARE PEG IN THE ROUND HOLE
IT'S WEIRD THAT TO THINK ABOUT THIS MAN GOOFING AROUND ON EARTH WOULD GO ONTO BE THE FIRST MAN TO STEP ON THE MOON
REMOVED
A LAUNCH REPLAY OF MISSION STARTING FROM T MINUS MINUTE THROUGH TO PAYLOAD FAIRING SEPARATION

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW AN ARIANESPACE ARIANE ROCKET LAUNCHED EARLIER TODAY FROM THE GUIANA SPACE CENTER IN FRENCH GUIANA SOUTH AMERICA TO BRING FOUR GALILEO NAVIGATION SATELLITES TO ORBIT THE GALILEO CONSTELLATION IS MUCH LIKE GPS AND WILL ALLOW USERS TO TRACK THEIR POSITION ON EARTH ONCE IT BECOMES OPERATIONAL WITH LAUNCH OF THE REQUISITE SATELLITES ARE IN ORBIT

THIS WAS ACTUALLY A SOMEWHAT RARE MORNING LAUNCH FOR ARIANE BECAUSE IT IS NORMALLY USED TO LAUNCH COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES TO GTO ARIANE OFTEN LAUNCH IN THE LATE EVENING NIGHTTIME SO BEING ABLE TO WATCH ONE LAUNCH IN THE DAYLIGHT WAS A GOOD CHANGE OF PACE ADDITIONALLY THIS ARIANE WAS FLYING IN AN ES CONFIGURATION WITH A SHORTER PAYLOAD FAIRING GIVING THE ROCKET A MUCH STOCKIER LOOK THAN THE NORMAL ECA VARIANT HETP
THAT IS ONE ANGRY BALL OF FIRE

INCIDENTALLY WHEN ARE WE GOING TO DO MERCURY LANDER THERE IS ICE ON IT COME ON
THIS IS FROM STEREO OBSERVATORY MESSENGER COULDN'T PHOTOGRAPH THE SUN IT DIDN'T HAVE APPROPRIATE FILTERS FOR THAT
NASA ADMINISTRATOR IS A POLITICAL APPOINTMENT

THAT SEEMS LIKE A POOR WAY TO LEAD A LONG RANGE AGENCY LIKE NASA
CONSIDERING ALL HIS OTHER SELECTIONS SO FAR HAVE BEEN PARTY INSIDERS AND OR CAREER POLITICIANS IT WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE AN AGENT OF CHANGE IT WILL BE WHATEVER REPUBLICAN HE EITHER OWES OR NEEDS A FAVOR FROM JUST LIKE THE REST OF HIS ADMINISTRATION
I TRULY HOPE AN INSIDER SO WE STOP WASTING SO MUCH TIME EFFORT AND MONEY BY CHANGING OUR MIND ALL THE TIME CANCELLING THE CONSTELLATION PROGRAM AFTER SO MUCH HAD GONE INTO IT WAS SO WASTEFUL I REALLY TRULY WISH TO SEE NASA AS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY

EXPLANATION FASTER THAN A SPEEDING BULLET MORE POWERFUL THAN A LOCOMOTIVE AND ABLE TO LEAP TALL BUILDINGS IN A SINGLE BOUND THIS SOYUZ ROCKET STANDS ON THE LAUNCH PAD AT BAIKONUR COSMODROME IN KAZAKHSTAN ON NOVEMBER BEYOND IT RISES A SUPERMOON BUT FAME FOR EXCEPTIONAL FEATS OF SPEED STRENGTH AND AGILITY IS NOT THE REASON NOVEMBER'S FULL MOON WAS GIVEN THIS POPULAR NAME INSTEAD WHENEVER A FULL MOON SHINES NEAR PERIGEE THE CLOSEST POINT IN ITS ELLIPTICAL ORBIT AROUND EARTH IT APPEARS LARGER AND BRIGHTER THAN OTHER MORE DISTANT FULL MOONS AND SO A SUPERMOON IS BORN IN FACT NOVEMBER'S SUPERMOON WAS THE SECOND OF THREE CONSECUTIVE SUPERMOONS IN IT WAS ALSO THE CLOSEST AND MOST SUPERBEST FULL MOON SINCE MEANWHILE THE MILD MANNERED SOYUZ ROCKET IS SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH ITS EXPEDITION CREW TO THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION TODAY NOVEMBER
I WONDER IF KOROLEV EVER IMAGINED HIS R SOYUZ DESIGN WOULD STILL BE TAKING PEOPLE TO SPACE FIFTY YEARS AFTER IT FIRST FLEW

FIFTY YEARS AGO ON NOVEMBER THE FIRST SOYUZ LAUNCHED FROM THE SAME PAD AT BAIKONUR UNMANNED
REMOVED
CRAZY TO ME THAT THESE SOYUZ LAUNCHES TO THE ISS DON'T SEE MORE COVERAGE AND COMMENTING ON HERE THIS IS THE ONLY METHOD OF LAUNCHING HUMANS INTO SPACE CURRENTLY YOU WOULD THINK PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT IT
I LIKE IT A LOT BUT INITIALLY WAS A TINY BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT MAJOR TOM
EVEN STOLE THE TITLE

STAYED UP UNTIL TO GET A SHOT OF PLEIADES WITH MY DLR BY HOLOCRON AUG

ORIGINAL
MISLEADING AS THIS IS NOT A SINGLE SHOT THIS IS THE RESULT OF MULTIPLE LONG EXPOSURES STACKED IN PROCESSING

STILL GREAT PICTURE THOUGH
GUYS CHECK THE DATE IT WAS TAKEN ON THE OF AUG NOT YESTERDAY
AMAZING SHOT MANUAL LOVE THAT CONSTELLATION IF I DON'T MIND ME ASKING WHAT GEAR ARE YOU USING
VERY NICE PHOTO PLEIADES IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CONSTELLATIONS TO FIND AND LOOK AT IN THE NIGHT SKY INTERESTING TO SEE IT SO UP CLOSE
IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE AN EDUCATOR SO STOKED TO GET KIDS INTO THE MINDSET OF FORGING THE FUTURE OF SPACE EXPLORATION WISH I WAS HALF AS COOL AS THIS GUY
ISN'T THIS JUST AN ARTISTIC DEPICTION JUPITER DOESN'T SPIN THAT FAST IN REAL TIME AND CAMERAS AREN'T HELD UP BY CAMERAMEN WITH PALSY

EDIT ALSO JUNO DOESN'T EVEN HAVE VIDEO CAPABILITIES STATIC SHOTS ARE JUST STITCHED TOGETHER TO MAKE GIBS
THIS VIDEO WAS POSTED BY A YOUTUBE CHANNEL DEDICATED TO FAKE UFO VIDEOS THE ORIGINAL VIDEO IS HERE
IT'S JUST ANOTHER VIDEO TO SCIENTIFIC AND HUMAN PROGRESS
IF IT DOESN'T HAVE A NASA OR JPL PEDIGREE A SIMULATION SEEMS PRETTY LIKELY PLUS THE VIDEO LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE IMAGES RELEASED BY NASA JPL SARI
THE CAMERA SHAKE IS SOME ONE HOLDING A CAMERA TO THEIR COMPUTER SCREEN
NOTICE HOW THE PLUS SIGNS THAT DIVIDE THE IMAGE SHAKE AT THE SAME RATE AS THE IMAGE
I'M GUESSING THIS IS A COMPOSITE WITH REAL PHOTOS AND ANIMATION IN BETWEEN AND THE SHAKY CAM IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE ALL THE JAGGED EDGES LESS NOTICEABLE LIKE SOMEONE DID WITH THE MARS LANDER

I AM A BOTANY FAQ CODE
FOLLOWING THE SPILL THE LENGTH OF SHORELINE THAT RECEDED MORE THAN FEET METERS A YEAR QUADRUPLED COMPARED TO THE YEAR BEFORE THE SPILL THE LAND LOSSES OCCURRED MAINLY IN AREAS WHERE OIL HAD WASHED ASHORE DURING THE SPILL


HOLY SHIT DOES THAT MEAN THERE ARE AREAS OF SHORELINE THAT HAVE RECEDED FEET SINCE AS A RESULT OF THIS SPILL
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH SPACE ASTRONOMY COSMOLOGY THE STUDY DIDN'T EVEN USE SATELLITE DATA IT USED LAVS TO COLLECT DATA
IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES JUNO HAS HAD PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT TAKING PICTURES IS NOT PRIMARY MISSION AND 2 JUNO IS CURRENTLY IN A VERY LONG ORBIT ALMOST TWO MONTHS LONG AND IT WILL ONLY BE TAKING PICTURES WHEN VERY CLOSE TO JUPITER THAT MEANS EVEN IF EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECTLY PICTURES WILL ONLY BE TAKEN ABOUT EVERY MONTH AND A HALF
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEM MISSING THE INSERTION WINDOW SEEM TO RECALL SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES ANYWAYS THE PROBE WENT INTO SAFE MODE AND DIDN'T EXECUTE ITS BURN CIRC
2 ETC

JUNO ENCOUNTERED SOME ISSUES IN THE PAST MONTH DELAYING SCIENCE OPERATIONS IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'LL START UP AGAIN ONCE THEY CORRECT THE ORBIT AT THE NEXT APPROACH
I KNOW FOR A FACT IT HAS THE PICTURES ON BOARD ALREADY BUT FOR SOME REASON THEY'RE WAITING FOR THE DATA DUMP AND THE LATEST DELAYS AFFECTED IT MORE
DOUBTFUL THESE FLIGHTS REQUIRE A AIRLINER BUT IT'S HARD ON THE AIRFRAME AND REQUIRES A DECENT PILOT TO AVERT DISASTER

I'D SAY IT'S REASONABLY PRICED ALREADY
I'VE DONE ONCE I DID MY FIRST FLIGHT THEY OFFERED ADDITIONAL FLIGHTS FOR HALF PRICE
FEASIBLE YES ECONOMIC NUMBER THIS WILL REQUIRE TREMENDOUS REDESIGN TO MATE THE MISSION STACK FROM ONE DESIGN TO ANOTHER BOOSTER EVEN ASSUMING THAT MECHANICAL STRESSES ALIGN FOR INSTANCE WHEN BUILDING THE POLYBUS BATTLESTATION WITH PARTS THE SOVIET ENDED UP HAVING TO LAUNCH IT UPSIDE DOWN AND ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS DON'T CONFLICT

ROCKETS DON'T COME IN INTERNATIONALLY STANDARDIZED DIAMETERS MY KERB
ARIANE V IS THEY JUST NEVER USED IT AS SUCH BECAUSE THE HERMES SPACE PLANE WAS CANCELED FOR BUDGETARY REASONS
ESA LAUNCHES SOYUZ ROCKETS NOW TOO FROM THE SAME LAUNCH SITE AS ARIANE IT WOULD LIKELY BE SIMPLER TO INTEGRATE THE SOYUZ SPACECRAFT INTO THE SOYUZ 2 WHICH ALREADY LAUNCHES PROGRESS CARGO SHIPS THAN ARIANE
THIS WAS STUDIED AT ONE POINT PAYLOAD INTERFACES COUPLED LOADS AND PAYLOAD CAPACITY ALL WORK THOUGH IT WOULD NEED A NEW FAIRING DESIGN THE BIG ISSUE IS LAUNCH LOCATION ARIANESPACE ONLY HAS LAUNCH FACILITIES AT GUIANA AND THE LAUNCH GOES OVER THE OCEAN SO IN AN ABORT THE CAPSULE WOULD HAVE TO SPLASH DOWN THIS TURNS OUT TO BE QUITE PROBLEMATIC SOYUZ IS DESIGNED FOR AT MOST SHALLOW LAKE LANDINGS IDEALLY SOLID LAND AND THERES NOT MANY OTHER FACILITIES IN THE WORLD THAT LAUNCH OVER LAND OUTSIDE RUSSIA
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED IT'S IMPLAUSIBLE AUSTRALIAN AEROSPACE INDUSTRY IS NON-EXISTENT

AND IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME BBC MADE A DOOZY
I DIDN'T REALIZE JUST HOW BIG THIS ROVER WAS THAT WAS QUITE A FEAT TOO BAD RUSSIA IS NOT DOING MORE EXPLORATION WITH ROVERS
SPACE ROCKET WITH TRANSPORT MANNED SPACECRAFT OF A NEW MODIFICATION OF SOYUZ MS

THE BAIKONUR COSMODROME PLURAL LAUNCH DATE NOVEMBER GMT

THE CREW COMMANDER OLEG NOVITSKY ROSCOSMOS FLIGHT ENGINEERS THOMAS PERQUEST ESA AND PEGGY WHITSON NASA
IN A TEAM OF THE POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY HEADED BY DR EUGENE GUREVICH WAS TASKED TO DEVELOP A ALTIMETER GRA FOR THE NEW SOYUZ A GRA MEASURES THE PHOTON BACKSCATTER FROM GROUND RESULTING FROM THE TRANSMISSION OF PHOTONS FROM A COBALT GAMMA SOURCE THE ALTIMETER RECORDS THE DISTANCE TO THE GROUND AND AT JUST METERS IT TRIGGERS THE SOFT LANDING ENGINES TO SLOW DOWN THE CAPSULE TO M S IMPACT WHICH IS ALSO ABSORBED BY THE SEAT DAMPING SYSTEM

I M OPEN FOR BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE SHOYUS
WHAT D BE THE EQUIVALENT OF HOW THE APOLLO FLEW TO
THE MOON
I CLICKED ON THIS THINKING IT WAS A FY BUT SINCE I'M HERE

TO ANSWER THIS WE HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT KIND OF SIGNALS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FREQUENCY AMPLITUDE TYPE OF BROADCAST VAGUE I KNOW AND DIRECTION ARE ALL IMPORTANT

SO WHICH SIGNAL IS ON THE FRONT OF THE EXPANDING IF YOUR TV SIGNAL IS ALL SNOW AND YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEO IS FOREVER BUFFERING WOULD YOU SAY YOU WERE RECEIVING THE SIGNAL CARL SAGAN AND THE MOVIE CONTACT SAY IT WAS OLYMPIC ADDRESS BECAUSE IT WAS HIGH ENOUGH FREQUENCY TO PENETRATE THE SOLAR WINDS AND ESCAPE RELATIVELY UNHARMED FROM OUR SOLAR SYSTEM BUT ITS AMPLITUDE WAS LOW IT ALSO DOESN'T HELP THAT THIS WAS OMNIDIRECTIONAL SO THE AMPLITUDE DECREASES AT A SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE MANY PEOPLE THINK THIS SIGNAL WON'T BE RECEIVABLE

HOW ABOUT THE ARECIBO MESSAGE THAT WAS HIGH FREQUENCY AND AMPLITUDE BUT WAS ALSO SENT DIRECTIONALLY WITH A REFLECTING DISC TO A CERTAIN GLOBULAR STAR CLUSTER ALIENS WILL PROBABLY ONLY GET THAT ONE IN LESS THAN THOUSAND YEARS IF THEY HAPPEN TO MOVE INTO THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN OUR STAR AND THAT CLUSTER AND ALSO LISTEN IN OUR DIRECTION AND HAVE SOME RESOURCES DEVOTED TO SCANNING DATA FOR NON-NATURAL PATTERNS AND CAN FIGURE OUT THAT MESSAGE SERIOUSLY S PEOPLE THAT'S NOT A MESSAGE THAT'S A

SO LET'S SAY LIGHT YEARS TOPS AS TIME MARCHES ALONG WE HAVE FEWER RADIO BROADCASTS AND MORE SHOUT AT A STAR TO FIND ALIENS BROADCASTS SO THAT BUBBLE GETS A LITTLE BUMPY AND UNEVEN TOO

HERE'S A TOP DOWN GALACTIC MAP WITH LIGHT YEARS AS THE LITTLE BLUE DOT IN THE CLOSE-UP OF THE SAGITTARIUS ORION ARM IT MAKES SENSE TO LOOK AT IT TOP DOWN AT THIS DISTANCE THE GALACTIC PLANE IS PRETTY FLAT SO A GALACTIC MAP DOESN'T REALLY WORK OUR BROADCASTS HAVEN'T MADE IT FAR ENOUGH TO REALLY EVEN BE A BLIP ON THE GALACTIC RADAR

IF YOU IMAGINE THAT BLUE DOT EXPANDING INTO THESE TWO MAPS AT LIGHT YEARS HETP AND LIGHT YEARS HETP YOU CAN START TO SEE THE STARS THAT COULD POSSIBLY HEAR US

FROM THERE IT'S A MATER OF DETERMINING WHICH IS THE FIRST BROADCAST WHICH ONE WERE YOU THINKING
THIS WEBSITE IS PRETTY COOL AND SHOWS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR
THIS GUY IS GETTING TO BE A REAL DOWNER DEADLINE FOR OUR OWN DESTRUCTION UNABLE TO COPE WITH ALIENS IF CONTACTED GOD PARTICLE COULD WIPE OUT THE UNIVERSE HETP
HERE LIES THE PROBLEM WE LIVE IN THE ME ME ME ERA AND MAJORITY PEOPLE THINK I WON'T EVEN BE ALIVE IN YEARS WHY SHOULD I CARE NO REGARDS FOR FUTURE HUMANS
WASHINGTON POST JUST AS BAD AS THE ONION WITH THEIR JOURNALISM
I THINK THIS IS CLICKBATE BUT AT THE SAME TIME YEARS IS INCREDIBLY OPTIMISTIC FOR HUMANS TO REMAIN ON THIS PLANET BUT THE NEXT YEARS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY TELLING
DOESN'T SPACE PLAN TO HAVE PEOPLE ON MARS BY AND HAVE A COLONY BY I THINK HAWKING IS OVERLY PESSIMISTIC ABOUT HUMANITIES CAPABILITY TO DO THIS BECAUSE UNLIKE THE CANMAN BEHIND MARS ONE ELON MUSK IS BRILLIANT AND NOT FULL OF SHIT

EVEN IF HAWKING WAS TALKING ABOUT GOING TO AN EXOPLANET THAT STILL SEEMS A BIT PESSIMISTIC TOWARDS HUMANS IN THINKING WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE CAPABILITIES TO COLONIZE PROXIMA B OR G C E F IN YEARS THINK OF HOW MUCH TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES EACH DECADE I'M SURE WE WILL MAKE IT TO THE STARS UNLESS WE DESTROY OURSELVES IN SOME APOCALYPSE
YEARS NOT NOT FOR A SCIENTIST HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ARRIVED AT THIS NUMBER BY CALCULATIONS SHOW YOUR WORK
VERY COOL TO SEE SOME SUCCESSFUL TESTING OF THE ITS HARDWARE IT'S ONE THING FOR SOMEONE TO DECLARE THEY'RE GOING TO MARS AND HERE IS THEIR ROADMAN ITS ANOTHER THING ENTIRELY TO GO THE FULL STEP OF ACTUALLY BUILDING AND TESTING HARDWARE FROM THEIR SCALED VERSION OF A FULLY FUNCTIONAL RAPTOR METHALOX ENGINE TO THIS FULLY TANK THEY'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BUT THEY'RE A LOT FARTHER THAN ANYONE ELSE RUNNING IN THIS GAME

FOR NOW HOWEVER THEIR REAL NEXT STEPS WILL BE RTF NEXT MONTH AND HOPEFULLY THE DEBUT OF THE F NEXT YEAR I'M CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC FOR MARCH OR APRIL THE HARDWARE OF BOTH THE ROCKET AND THE LAUNCH PAD ITSELF ARE FINALLY DONE UNLIKE IN PAST YEARS WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAUNCH
IS SPACE X REALLY PUSHING TO GET THE ITS DONE IN OTHER WORDS CAN I EXPECT TO SEE OR HEAR ABOUT MORE HARDWARE TESTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE SPACE X HAS SO MUCH GOING 2 ABOUT TO HEAD INTO CREW FLIGHTS STILL NO F GOTTA ACTUALLY GET BACK TO FLYING ITS
WORKS ONLY WITH THC VIVE TOO BAD IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE AND REQUIRES ALSO A VERY EXPENSIVE PC BUT WITH SOFTWARE LIKE THIS WE CAN PROGRESS TOWARDS VR AND MAKE THE HARDWARE MUCH CHEAPER
SOURCE AND RELEVANT INFO

IS THE HEART AND SOUL OF OUR GALAXY LOCATED IN CASSIOPEIA POSSIBLY NOT BUT THAT IS WHERE TWO BRIGHT EMISSION NEBULAS NICKNAMED HEART AND SOUL CAN BE FOUNDATION THE HEART NEBULA OFFICIALLY DUBBED IC AND VISIBLE IN THE FEATURED IMAGE ON THE RIGHT HAS A SHAPE REMINISCENT OF A CLASSICAL HEART SYMBOL BOTH NEBULAS SHINE BRIGHTLY IN THE RED LIGHT OF ENERGIZED HYDROGEN SEVERAL YOUNG OPEN CLUSTERS OF STARS POPULATE THE IMAGE AND ARE VISIBLE HERE IN BLUE INCLUDING THE NEBULA CENTERS LIGHT TAKES ABOUT YEARS TO REACH US FROM THESE NEBULAS WHICH TOGETHER SPAN ROUGHLY LIGHT YEARS STUDIES OF STARS AND CLUSTERS LIKE THOSE FOUND IN THE HEART AND SOUL NEBULAS HAVE FOCUSED ON HOW MASSIVE STARS FORM AND HOW THEY AFFECT THEIR ENVIRONMENT
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS FINISHED CHAGRIN ITS LAZER AND IS ABOUT TO SHOOP DA WHOOP
THIS IS NOT AN IMAGE TAKEN WITH HUBBLE ITS FIELD OF VIEW IS A TINY FRACTION OF THIS AREA THIS IS TAKEN FROM OUR ROCK IT'S A NARROWBAND IMAGE UTILIZING A COLORING SCHEME THAT IS CALLED A HUBBLE PALETTE

NICE ALBUM IT JUST MAKES ME WONDER THAT IF I SHOW UP AT BAIKONUR WOULD I BE ABLE TO ENTER THIS BUILDING AND EXPLORE MYSELF OR DO I NEED TO BRIBE PEOPLE OR WHATEVER TO GET IN
UNVOTED SAVED AND LEAVING A COMMENT SO I CAN FIND THIS AGAIN WITH EASE TO REFER TO THOSE PHOTOS OF THE SPACE SHUTTLES CHEERS OP
WHAT'S YOUR SOURCE I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL TO GO THERE AND DRILL GET A CAMERA IN THAT OCEAN
I THINK LIKE MOST POLITICIANS AND GRANDIOSE SPACE EXPLORATION PLANS ITS VAGUE ENOUGH AND THE END GOAL IS FAR ENOUGH OUT HE CAN MAKE THE CLAIM HE CARES AND WE WILL GO BUT CONTINUOUSLY OUT OFF ACTUALLY ASKING CONGRESS FOR MONEY TO DO IT NOMINALLY LEAVING THE REAL WORK FOR THE NEXT GUY BUT IN REALITY NOTHING WILL HAPPEN ITS THE EQUIVALENT OF BUSH PLANS TO GO TO MARS WHICH WERE NOTHING LIKE HIS FATHERS PLANS HETP TO GO TO MARS FROM YEARS BEFORE
I FEEL A LOT LIKE CHARLIE BROWN HETP AND EVERY NEW ADMINISTRATION IS LUCY
THE ONLY THING I TAKE FROM ANY OF THESE INTERESTS IS TRUMP USING THEM AS A WAY OF CUTTING NASA RESEARCH AND MONITORING OF THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE HE'S AN CLIMATE CHANGE BELIEVER THAT'S ALL THIS IS NOTHING MORE A WAY OF TRYING TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR OTHER ITEMS SO HE PULL THE RUG ON THOSE EFFORTS I HONESTLY DON'T BELIEVE HE CARES A SINGLE IOTA ABOUT SPACE RESEARCH UNLESS SOMEHOW IT BENEFITS HIM FINANCIALLY
SHOWS US THAT THEY'RE NOT INFALLIBLE

THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS HUMAN ALIEN DNA RESEARCH BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANY ALIENS

THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK

SPIERS WAS FOUND DEAD ON A SOFA AT A FRIEND S HOUSE IN POLAND DAYS AFTER WARNING HIS MOTHER TO INVESTIGATE IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO HIM FRIENDS ALSO CLAIM HE HAD VOMITED A BLACK LIQUID BEFORE HIS DEATH

WHAT HAPPENED TO USING LOCALLY AVAILABLE TOOLS
OLD WOMAN GOT HYSTERICAL THAT'S ALL ITS GENDER SPECIFIC YOU KNOW
I DONT REALLY KNOW WHY THEY WANT TO BUILD EVERYTHING ON THE SURFACE
WOULD IT NOT BE A BETTER IDEA TO BUILD EVERYTHING INSIDE OF THE MOON
WE NEED TO LEAVE EVERYTHING ON THE MOON AND USE IT LOCALLY IF WE LIGHTEN THE MASS ITS ORBIT WILL BEGIN TO ALTER THAT WOULD BE BAD FOR US IF YOU DIDNT UNDERSTAND
THE REQUIREMENTS ARE NEARLY THE SAME AS FOR A LAUNCH THE ONLY ADVANTAGE IS THE THINNER ATMOSPHERE WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO LAUNCH SMALLER ROCKETS SMALLER ROCKETS ARE CHEAPER PER LAUNCH BUT MORE EXPENSIVE PER KILOGRAM THAT IS NOT SPACE FOR THE MASSES IT IS SPACE FOR SMALL SATELLITES THAT CANNOT BE LAUNCHED TOGETHER WITH LARGER PAYLOADS ON LARGER ROCKETS THE CHEAPEST LAUNCH OPTION IT IS MAYBE STRATOSPHERE FOR THE MASSES A NEARLY BLACK SKY A NICE VIEW GREAT BUT NOT SPACE

WELL IN FAIRNESS TO OUR SUN YOU KIND OF LET GO A BIT ON THE SIDES AFTER YOU HAVE HAD NINE KIDS
STARS ARE NOT PERFECT SPHERES WHILE THEY ROTATE THEY BECOME FLAT DUE TO THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE

THEY BULGE AT THE EQUATOR BUT THEY DON'T BECOME FLAT THAT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THE STARS ARE DISKS
IN TWELVE HOURS AN ARIANESPACE ARIANE ROCKET IS SET TO LAUNCH FOUR SATELLITES FOR GALILEO NAVIGATION CONSTELLATION ONCE COMPLETE THE GALILEO CONSTELLATION WILL PROVIDE WORLDWIDE NAVIGATION SERVICES VIA SATELLITES PLUS SPARES ORBITING SOME KM ABOVE EARTH CURRENTLY THERE ARE GALILEO SATELLITES IN ORBIT ALL LAUNCHED ON PREVIOUS ARIANESPACE FLIGHTS AND LAUNCH WILL BRING THAT NUMBER UP TO ALLOWING FOR THE START OF PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME ARIANESPACE IS USING AN ARIANE ROCKET TO LAUNCH GALILEO SATELLITES HAVING BEEN LAUNCHED ON SOYUZ ROCKETS

YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT THE LAUNCH IN THE LAUNCH THREAD THAT THIS POST LINKS TO FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND DISCUSS THE LAUNCH AND BE SURE TO TUNE IN TO THE LISTED LIVESTREAMS TO WATCH THE LAUNCH WITH OTHER FANS
WHY IS THIS A THING NOW AT FIRST IT WAS WHEN THIS POST IS FOUR HOURS OLD NOW IT'S UP TO

THE HEART WAS THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WHEN I SAW THE NEW HORIZON PICTURES FOR THE FIRST TIME IT INSTANTLY JUMPS OUT AT YOU EVEN IN THE EARLIEST PICTURES THAT NASA RELEASED OF PLUTO THAT SHOWED ANY SIGNIFICANT DETAILS PRIOR TO NEW HORIZONS ARRIVING IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT ARTISTS DEPICTED PLUTO AS A DULL ICY WORLD WITH LITTLE BEAUTY TO IT I'M GLAD THAT NATURE PROVIDED THE EXACT OPPOSITE A FASCINATING WORLD WITH A MULTITUDE OF COLORS AND TERRAINS THAT TANTALIZE THE EYE OF THOSE WHO BEHOLD IT
IS IT ME OR DOES IT LOOK LIKE WE'RE FINDING OR AT LEAST SUSPECTING NEW SUBTERRANEAN OCEANS LEFT AND RIGHT THESE DAYS
WAY WE ARE GOING WE ARE GOING TO WONDER IF THERE IS LIFE EVERYWHERE
TEAM SUGGESTED THAT THE BASIN'S THICK LAYERS OF ICE DEPOSITED OVER MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF YEARS COMBINED WITH EJECTA FROM THE IMPACT THAT CREATED THE BASIN MIGHT HAVE MADE SPUTNIK POLANISIA HEAVY ENOUGH TO MIGRATE

BUT A SECOND TEAM OF RESEARCHERS LED BY FRANCIS NIMMO A PLANETARY SCIENTIST FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SANTA CRUZ THINKS AN INNER OCEAN IS A MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION


I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON THERE AS I'M SURE IT'S AN AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL NATURAL PROCESS BUT IN THE MEAN TIME PLEASE LABEL YOUR BEST GUESS AS SUCH THANKS
WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THAT BLUE HAZE
IS IT AN EARLY EARTH RISE OR JUST A LENSE FLARE
LOOKS LIKE TWO WACKY WAVING INFLATABLE ARM FLAILING TUBE MEN ON THE MOON

EDIT WAIT WOULD WACKY WAVING INFLATABLE ARM FLAILING TUBE MEN EVEN WORK ON THE MOON
IF SOMEONE WENT UP THERE WITH A INCH VERTICAL DO YOU THINK THEY'D JUST FLOAT OFF
THIS COULD BE THE GREATEST AND MOST INSPIRING IMAGE CAPTURED BY MANUAL TWO TRAVELERS HUMANS
I KNOW THIS ISN'T APOLLO BUT I JUST WANT TO THROW OUT THERE THAT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I HAVE EVER WATCHED ON THE INTERNET
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THEY ARE JUST STANDING IN SOME DESERT ON EARTH THEN YOU REMEMBER THAT WHERE THEY ARE IS TOTALLY HOSTILE TO LIFE
HASSELBLAD MADE THE MOON CAMERAS FOR WEIGHT PURPOSES ASTRONAUGHTS ON THE FIRST LUNAR LANDING LEFT THE WHOLE CAMERA EXCEPT FOR THE FILM BOXES HASSELBLAD HAS A GOING OFFER TO REPLACE THE FILM BACKS IF ANYONE GOES UP AND GETS THE CAMERAS
THAT SENSE OF DREAD WHEN YOU START IMAGINING HOW DEEP THE WATER IS BELOW YOU WHILE OUT ON THE OCEAN JUST FROM GLANCING AT THIS FOR A SECOND UNREAL
THE MOON HAS AN ATMOSPHERE HOW IS THE LIGHT BOUNCING FROM EARTH CREATING A GLOW IN THE HORIZON
THAT CAN'T BE POSSIBLE THE UNIVERSE IS SO EXPANSIVE THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO PEOPLE YEARS TO FIND EACH OTHER
SHOULD WE HAVE SEEN THAT OR ARE WE SUPPOSED TO JUST NOT BLINK AFTERWARDS
SOURCE
AWESOME IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED BILLION HOT DOGS
IS ANYONE ELSE BOTHERED BY THE MISLEADING TITLE THIS IS NOT ANOTHER WORLD IT IS A MAJOR SATELLITE ORBITING WHAT WE CALL THE ACTUAL WORLD THAT WE ORIGINATE FROM
I NOTICED THAT SOME OLDER SPACE PHOTOS HAVE THOSE DARK PLUSES ON THEM WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THEM
WHAT APOLLO MISSION WAS THIS COOL SEEING THE BLUE RADIANCE FROM EARTH IN THE BACKGROUND
AND THEY AREN'T EVEN RIPPING EACH OTHER TO SHREDS ABOUT WHO WILL GET TO MINE THE RESOURCES A RARE SHOT BEEN IN THE EARLY STAGES OF SETTLEMENT
THIS WILL HAPPEN ON ANOTHER PLANET THAT'S IN ORBIT AROUND ANOTHER SUN HOW FAR INTO THE FUTURE WILL THAT BE YEARS TOO BAD ITS NOT DURING MY LIFETIME BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO PILOT A BLOCKADE RUNNING FREIGHTER TO SMUGGLE EARTH GROWN CANNABIS TO THE OUTER RIM
YOU DELETED AND RESUBMITTED YOUR OWN POST FROM HOURS AGO

R SPACE COMMENTS

I WOULD GIVE TEN YEARS OFF MY LIFE JUST TO BE THERE FOR TEN MINUTES
LOOK LIKE THE SHADOWS OF TWO SCARECROWS WONDER WHAT THEY ARE DOING AWAY FROM THE FARM
DID ANYONE READ THE BOOK WHO BUILT THE MOON BY CHRISTOPER KNIGHT AND ALAN BUTLER
AND HERE I WAS READING TOO HUMAN AND FINALLY HOPING FOR OUR SEQUEL DAMN YOU
MY MIND AUTOMATICALLY ADDED FIGHTING TO THE TITLE AND I GOT EXCITED

NOW I'M DISAPPOINTED
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT HEARTACHE AND THE LOSS OF GOD

WANDERING WANDERING IN HAPLESS NIGHT

OUT HERE IN THE PERIMETER THERE ARE NO STARS

OUT HERE WE IS STONED

IMMACULATE
FOR SOME REASON THE GEOMETRIC ARROWS POINTERS DISAPPEAR TO MY EYE WHEN I ZOOM IN SLIGHTLY ON THE PICTURE VERY STRANGE
IF THE ASTRONAUTS EQUATED DOWN AND TRIED TO PICK DIRT WOULD IT BE LIKE AT THE BEACH OR MORE LIKE COMPACTED DIRT
NO MATTER HOW HARD THOSE TWO TRAVELLERS TRIED THEY COULDN'T RE POPULATE HUMANITY ON THAT DESERT WORLD
THE MOON ALIEN RACE CONTACTED THEM THEY WARNED US TO NEVER GO BACK
IS NO ONE GOING TO MENTION THAT THE SHADOWS LOOK LIKE TWO PENGUINS ON AN EASEL

DESPITE THE TWIN SHADOWS THE ASTRONAUT REPORTED THE REST OF HIS CREW WERE IN THE LANDING CRAFT AT THE TIME THIS IMAGE WAS TAKEN
WEIRD VISUAL EFFECT WHERE THE SHADOWS LOOK LIKE THEY EXTEND HALFWAY TO THE HORIZON
WOW AS AN AMATEUR ASTRONOMER I'VE SEEN MANY SPACE PHOTOS BUT THIS ONE HITS A DIFFERENT NERVE SOMETHING ABOUT THE POV PERSPECTIVE GETS ME IT'S AS IF I'M TAKING THE PHOTO AND SEEING MY OWN SHADOW ON A WORLD THAT HAS LIKELY NEVER BEEN GRACED BY A HUMAN SHADOW I CAN ALMOST FEEL THE SENSE OF WONDER THAT THESE ASTRONAUTS MUST HAVE FELT IN THIS MOMENT

WHAT WENT WRONG LIKE IF WE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS BACK IN THE SHOULDN'T WE HAVE A SHIP HEADED OUT INTO DEEP SPACE NOW WITH AN INTERNATIONAL CREW
MAN STUFF LIKE THIS WILL NEVER CEASE TO MAKE ME JUST TAKE A SECOND AND BREATHE IT'S ONE OF THE MOST AWE INSPIRING THINGS THERE IS
ITS INCREDIBLE WHAT WE CAN ACHIEVE AS A SPECIES WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER
I THOUGHT THIS WAS TWO BIRDS SITTING ON A SAWHORSE TOOK ME SECS TO ACTUALLY SEE IT
SUCH AN ACHIEVEMENT AND PICTURE WHAT IS THE OVER UNDER THAT WE SEE A COMPARABLE EXPLORATIVE IMAGE ACHIEVEMENT AGAIN IN OUR LIFETIME
PETE CONRAD AND AL BEAN ON APOLLO HAD A SELF TIMER FOR THEIR HASSELBLAD CAMERAS WHICH THEY INTENDED TO USE TO TAKE AN ACTUAL PHOTO OF THE TWO OF THEM STANDING SIDE BY SIDE BUT THEY LOST THE TIMER IN A BAG AND ONLY FOUND IT WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE
MOON IS FULL OF NEW THINGS I WILL GO THERE TO EXPLORE THE NEW WORLD
PICTURES LIKE THIS ALWAYS GIVE ME CHILLS IN A POSITIVE WAY OF COURSE JUST ONE SIMPLE PHOTO BUT FULL OF ACHIEVEMENTS
WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE BLUE DOT WITH LIGHT CLOUD SPLASHING OFF OF IT ON THE CENTER LEFT SIDE IS THAT NEPTUNE OR SOMETHING
I'LL SEE YOUR TWO HUMANS ON ANOTHER WORLD AND RAISE YOU ANOTHER HUMAN ON ANOTHER WORLD

GALLERY
BEAT THAT OP
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW IT MUST HAVE FELT FOR THE LUCKY FEW WHO STEPPED FOOT ON THE MOON TO COME TO THE REALIZATION THAT YOU ARE ON THE MOON MUST BE AN INCREDIBLE FEELING
LOOKING AT THIS PICTURE AND YOU CAN'T HELP THINKING THE CHILDLIKE SENSE OF WONDER THESE TWO MEN SHARED IN THAT MOMENT JUDGING BY THE PHOTO THEY PROBABLY WERE CHANTING WE DID IT
DIDN'T SOMEONE ELSE JUST POST THIS YESTERDAY WITH A TITLE TWO SHADOWS ON THE MOON
REMINDS ME OF THE DIG GAME WHAT AN AWESOME ADVENTURE GAME

SO FUCKING DIFFICULT THOUGH

IT'S ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING JUST LOOKING AT THE ROCKS IN THIS PICTURE I MEAN COME ON THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE THE ONLY FORM OF LIFE IN THIS UNIVERSE JUST LOOKING AT THOSE ROCKS MAKES ME FEEL LIKE SOMETHING ELSE IS OUT THERE
THINKING ABOUT TAKING THIS GIRL I JUST MET THERE ON A FIRST DATE ANYTHING I SHOULD CONSIDER
THE FEELING OF DISCOVERING SOMETHING AND PIONEERING INTO WHAT NO MAN HAS SEEN BEFORE IS TRULY A FEELING UNLIKE ANY OTHER
THE SHADOWS ARE REAL BUT THE MOON ISNT THIS LOOKS LITERALLY LIKE RIGHT OUTSIDE MY HOUSE LITERALLY IM LOOKING OUT MY WINDOW AND I SEE THIS EXACT SAME THING
THE MOON IS NOT A WORLD

IT ORBITS THE EARTH

IT IS NOT A PLANET

IF THE MOON IS A SPHERE THEN WHY IS THERE NO CURVATURE ON THE HORIZON
ATTENTION OP IF PLUTO CAN'T BE CALLED A PLANET THAN YOU CAN'T CALL THE MOON A WORLD
I DONT THINK ITS REAL AND I THINK THE BLUE SHADE IN PICTURE IS DUE TO PHOTO EDITOR EFFECT
TOO BAD THIS PICTURE ISN'T REAL BUZ THE MOON LANDING WAS FAKED TO WIN THE SPACE RACE
HEY I CAN SEE STARS IN THAT PHOTOGRAPH

OR ARE THOSE STAGE LIGHTS

SIGH PLAINLY OBVIOUS THAT ALL THOSE EXTRA PERIODS WERE TO SIGNIFY SARCASM JERKS
THIS IS SO FAKE IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THE CROSS HAIRS YOU'LL SEE THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE THERE BECAUSE CAMERAS ONLY EXISTED IN NAZI RUSSIA THEN
THIS PICTURE SEEMS SO STAGED TO ME FORGET WHAT WE WERE TOLD FOR A MINUTE AND TAKE THIS PHOTOGRAPH OUT OF CONTEXT LOOK AT THE SHADOWS ON THE LEFT MIDDLE AND RIGHT SIDE TAKE A REALLY CLOSE LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PICTURE THE SHADOWS ARE POINTING TOWARDS THE TOP RIGHT OF THE PICTURE AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PICTURE THE SHADOWS ARE POINTING TOWARDS THE TOP LEFT OF THE PICTURE THE CENTER OF THE PICTURE THE SHADOWS RUN VERTICALLY STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN THIS PHOTOGRAPH CLEARLY APPEARS TO HAVE LIGHT SOURCES TO MAKE THE SHADOWS CAST IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
JUDGING BY THE PLUS SIGNS ALL OVER THE SCREEN I'D SAY THIS IS STAGED
FUNNY HOW A BUNCH OF SELF-PROCLAIMED SCIENCE EXPERTS HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH SHADOWS GOING AT MULTIPLE ANGLES


TECHNICALLY SAME WORLD JUST DIFFERENT PLANET OR STUDIO WHATEVER THEORY TICKLES YOUR COCKLES
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE PLUS SIGNS IN PHOTOS TAKEN ON THE MOON YOU WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO COVER POSSIBLE DATA THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL WITH A FUCKING PLUS SIGN
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE TREATING AS DISPOSABLE THE WORLD TO WHICH WE ARE ALREADY PERFECTLY ADAPTED
I PERSONALLY THINK WE HAVE ABOUT YEARS AFTER THAT CIVILIZATION WILL HAVE RETROGRADED INTO A FORM NOT CAPABLE OF GETTING OFF THE PLANET
THIS ARTICLE SUCKS NOT VERY SUBSTANTIAL OR EXPLANATORY AT ALL

FROM A DIFFERENT ARTICLE

SO WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED WELL AS TWO OF NASA S SPACE TELESCOPES WHICH INCLUDED THE NUCLEAR SPECTROSCOPIC TELESCOPE ARRAY OR CUSTAR FOR SHORT WERE OBSERVING THIS PARTICULAR BLACK HOLE A LARGE OBJECT VERY SUDDENLY LAUNCHED ITSELF AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE OR CORONA OF THE BLACK HOLE RIGHT AFTER THIS REMARKABLE EVENT A MASSIVE PULSE OF X-RAY ENERGY SPEWED FORTH FROM THE CORONA THIS EVENT SEEMS TO HAVE THE SCIENTISTS OF EARTH COMPLETELY BAFFLED

TO FIONA HARRISON WHO IS THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR CUSTAR MADE A STRONG NOTE SAYING THAT THIS TYPE OF PHENOMENON IS UNHEARD OF AND COMPLETELY CHANGES WHAT WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT ABOUT HOW BLACK HOLES FUNCTION LUCKILY WITH THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE AS A RACE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE WE WERE ABLE TO RECORD THIS EVENT THE DATA FROM THIS SHOULD PROVIDE NOW SOME CLUES TO JUST HOW BLACK HOLES FUNCTION AND HOW THEY ARE STRUCTURED





AND

SO IN SHORT IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OBSERVE A PHENOMENON THAT HAS COMPLETELY CHANGED HOW WE THOUGHT BLACK HOLES FUNCTIONED AN OBJECT ACTUALLY EXITED THE CORONA OF THE BLACK HOLE AND AFTERWARDS A FLARE OF X-RAY ENERGY FOLLOWED SUIT LEAVING US COMPLETELY BAFFLED




AND FROM ANOTHER ARTICLE

THE CORONA GATHERED INWARD AT FIRST AND THEN LAUNCHED UPWARDS LIKE A JET SAID WILKINS WE STILL DON T KNOW HOW JETS IN BLACK HOLES FORM BUT IT S AN EXCITING POSSIBILITY THAT THIS BLACK HOLE S CORONA WAS BEGINNING TO FORM THE BASE OF A JET BEFORE IT COLLAPSED

THE NATURE OF THE ENERGETIC SOURCE OF WE CALL THE CORONA IS MYSTERIOUS BUT NOW WITH THE ABILITY TO SEE DRAMATIC CHANGES LIKE THIS WE ARE GETTING CLUES ABOUT ITS SIZE AND STRUCTURE SAID FIONA HARRISON THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF CUSTAR AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY IN PASADENA WHO WAS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE STUDY




SO BASICALLY IT SOUNDS LIKE A BURST OF ENERGY CAME OUT OF THE BLACK HOLE WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE SINCE VIRTUALLY NOTHING NOT EVEN EM ENERGY IS SUPPOSED TO ESCAPE THE GRAVITY OF A BLOCKHOLE BUT IN SHORT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT IS AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ANYBODY IS EVEN OFFERING A HYPOTHESIS YET UNLESS I MISSED SOMETHING





EDIT A WORD
I'LL WAIT FOR STEPHEN HAWKING TO EXPLAIN IT TO NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON SO HE CAN EXPLAIN IT TO ME
I REALLY WISH THEY'D REMEMBER TO PUT ARTISTS RENDERING NOTATIONS ON IMAGES LIKE THOSE THEY ALWAYS END UP ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA WITH PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY AREN'T REAL
BLACK HOLES ARE OFTEN SURROUNDED BY A CLOUD OF DEBRIS THAT ARE VERY ENERGETIC THIS CAN EMIT AND MASS CAN BE EJECTED AWAY IT'S NOT LEAVING THE BLACK HOLE ITSELF JUST THE MASS OF STUFF ORBITING IT CLOSELY
PROBABLY A SPACECRAFT FILLED WITH BEINGS FROM ANOTHER UNIVERSE SINCE BLACK HOLES ARE GATEWAYS BETWEEN EACH UNIVERSE IN THE MULTIVERSE
THE WAY I SEE IT THERE'S REALLY ONLY TWO POSSIBILITIES SPOCK V NERO 2 AN EARTHLY TIME TRAVELER FROM WAY IN THE FUTURE WHEN TIME TRAVEL EXISTS DECIDED TO FIND A WORMHOLE EXITING THROUGH A BLACK HOLE MILLION LIGHT YEARS AWAY WHICH THE TRAVELER KNEW EARTHLINGS FROM OUR TIME WOULD HAVE A TELESCOPE FOCUSED ON PROBABLY SPOCK THOUGH
ARTICLE SAYS NOTHING ELSE TWO TELESCOPES OBSERVED SOMETHING BLACK HOLE RELATED

CAN SOMEONE PLEASE SCIENCE THE SHIT OUT IF THIS FOR ME ELIAPOSTGRADDOCTORATEINASTROPHYSICS
ACCORDING TO THE ILLUSTRATIONS AND WHAT I READ NOTHING CAME OUT OF THE EVENT HORIZON WHICH WOULD VIOLATE PHYSICS AS WE KNOW IT INSTEAD THIS WAS THE CORONA AN AREA ABOVE AND BELOW WHICH IS A SOURCE OF SEEMINGLY REFORMING AND THEN RELAUNCHING AS A JET SO IT DIDN'T COME OUT OF A BLACK HOLE BUT IT CAME OUT OF THE CORONAL AREA SURROUNDING THE BLACK HOLE INTERESTING BUT NOT IT'S LIKE THEY SAW HOW THE BLACK HOLE JETS FORM LIKE SUDDENLY SEEING A SLOW-MOTION VIDEO OF A BULLET EXITING A GUN
NOTHING ESCAPES BLACK HOLES THIS JUST IN OBJECTS COMING OUT OF BLACK HOLES

SO ANNOYING IT'S LIKE THE SCIENCE WRITERS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SCIENCE
DID IT COME OUT OF THE EVENT HORIZON IF IT DIDN'T THEN WHAT'S WITH ALL THE
ITS HAPPENINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG THE ENTERPRISE CAME THROUGH FROM ANOTHER TIME UNIVERSE FINALLY OH GOD THEIR TOO LATE THOUGH TRUMPS PRESIDENT AND HALF THE WORLD HATES THE OTHER HALF
SO THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE REALISING THAT ALL WE KNOW IS SHIT

GREAT
I MEAN THIS IS PROBABLY AN ABSURD PISS INTO THE WIND BUT DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEA NOW AS TO HOW X RAYS CAN BE USED TO TRANSPORT AN OBJECT OR IS THIS A LITERAL DA FAQ MOMENT


THIS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ANYTHING NEW TO ME UNLESS I AM COMPLETELY MISTAKEN

THINGS INSIDE OF THE EVENT HORIZON CANNOT ESCAPE BUT THAT ISN'T TO SAY AN ACCRETION DISK ORBITING THE BLACK HOLE AT VELOCITY COULDN'T EJECT MATTER AS IT WOULD NOT BE INSIDE THE EVENT HORIZON

ANOTHER ANNOYING THING IN THE ARTICLE IS THAT IT CLAIMS BLACK HOLES ARE KNOWN FOR SUCKING THINGS IN BUT AGAIN THIS IS NOT THE CASE OUTSIDE OF THE EVENT HORIZON GRAVITY BEHAVES IN VERY MUCH THE SAME WAY AS AROUND STARS ONLY WHEN YOU GET TOO CLOSE WOULD YOU BE UNABLE TO ESCAPE AND EVEN THEN IT IS NOT SO MUCH SUCKING IN AS RATHER YOU CAN ONLY TRAVEL TOWARDS THE CENTRE

REMOVED
CHECKED THIS ON THE NEWS SEEMS LIKE THERE'S AN ARTICLE LIKE THIS EVERY YEAR NOT SURE IF THIS IS AUTHENTIC OR JUST A DELIBERATE REPACKAGING OF A KNOWN PHENOMENON
NASA OBSERVES OBJECT COMING OUT OF BLACK HOLE MARKARIAN
OH NO SINCE IF TRUE BIG BANG GOES ANOTHER THEORY

THE DIFFERENCE OF BETWEEN THE POLAR AND EQUATORIAL RADII IS TINY COMPARED TO THE STAR'S MEAN RADIUS OF MILLION KM

COMFY COMFY HOW CAN YOU SPEND ONE MINUTE RESTING IN THERE WITH SUCH CONSTANT MOTIVATION
I REALLY LIKE THE COLOR OF YOUR WALL BRO DOES THIS COLOR HAVE A NAME

THE POSTERS ARE PRETTY COOL TOO
I ALSO WANTED THIS BUT THAT MEANS I ALSO HAD TO PUT IT ABOVE MY BED I'M REALLY AFRAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FALL ON ME BECAUSE OF BRACKING IN MY PROVINCE NOT IN THE US THERE ARE EARTHQUAKES NOT AS MUCH ANYMORE BECAUSE OF ALL THE PROTESTS AND THEM NEEDING TO PAY FOR ANY DAMAGE BUT STILL I FIND IT VERY SCARY

HOWEVER I HAVE NOT SEEN THESE POSTERS YET ARE THESE NEW OR DID I MISS SOMETHING

IT LOOKS VERY GOOD OP ALSO THE GREEN WALL THE LIGHTS THE COLOR OF THE BED AND NIGHTSTAND ARE LOOKING VERY GOOD
IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED THERE IS A POST ON IMAGER OF AN ABANDONED HANGAR WITH SEVERAL PICTURES OF 2 OF THE BURAN CRAFT INSIDE SLOWLY GOING TO RUIN

GALLERY
SOURCE FOR THE PICTURE IS THE AMAZING RESOURCE HERE IS A LINK TO PICTURES OF THE SYSTEM BEFORE ITS FIRST AND ONLY FLIGHT BROWSE THE NUMBERS ON TOP FOR MORE PICTURES THE CARRIER ROCKET ITSELF CALLED ANERGIA HAD TWO FLIGHTS IN TOTAL BURAN FLIGHT WAS ITS SECOND AND LAST FLIGHT FIRST ONE WAS CARRYING A SPACE BASED LASER WEAPON CALLED POLUS HETP

LET US ALL APPRECIATE THE ENGINEERING FEAT OF BOTH ANERGIA AND BURAN DESPITE THE COUNTRY AND SYSTEM IT WAS MADE IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HARDWORKING PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TESTS HAD TO BE DONE AND HUNDREDS OF NEW MATERIALS HAD TO BE INVENTED MANY PEOPLE IN RUSSIA IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER KNOW SOMEONE THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THIS MASSIVE COUNTRYWIDE UNDERTAKING ONE OF MY UNCLES FOR EXAMPLE WAS INVOLVED IN PRODUCTION OF THE SCREENS AND OTHER ELECTRONICS USED IN COCKPIT

EDIT I TRIED TO WRITE A POST FOCUSING ON TENDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO USED A DECADE OF THEIR LIFE ON THIS UNDERTAKING OF COURSE AS USUAL R SPACE STEPS UP TO THE PLATE WITH ABSOLUTE SHITPOSTS OF COMMENTS WITHIN MIN OF MY POST BASICALLY BY TAKING A DUMP ON ALL THOSE THAT PUSHED SCIENCE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT STAY CLASSY R SPACE SORRY FOR BEING SALTY BUT THERE IS A REASON WHY MANY CONSIDER QUALITY AT R SPACE TO BE ABSOLUTELY ABYSMAL
I JUST LEARNED ABOUT THE BURAN IN ONE OF MY CLASSES

IMO THE COOLEST PART ABOUT THIS SPACECRAFT WAS THAT ITS ONE AND ONLY FLIGHT WAS COMPLETELY UNMANNED WHICH IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE UNITED STATES SHUTTLES WERE CAPABLE OF BUT NEVER DID
AND NOW A COPY OF BURAN IS STANDING IN MOSCOW AT THE VDNKH EXPO YOU CAN EVEN GET INSIDE AND HAVE A LOOK AROUND
I FIND IT INTERESTING HOW SIMILAR IT LOOKS TO WHAT WE HAD GOING OVER HERE SEEMS LIKE TWO PATHS TO THE SAME DESTINATION THOUGH I REALIZE I CAN ONLY SEE THE MOST SIMPLISTIC ELEMENTS IN THE PHOTOS AND I IMAGINE THE GUTS ARE ENORMOUSLY DIFFERENT
SAD STORY THE ONLY LITHUANIAN COSMONAUT WAS SCHEDULED TO FLY BURAN HE WAS KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH IN AN AIRSHOW IN

WIKI IUS
I MAY NOT BE A FAN OF THE CURRENT RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT BUT I RESPECT THE FUCK OUT OF RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS
MY GRANDFATHER WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED INTO MAKING THIS THING TAKE OFFICIAL HE WAS AN ENGINEER SADLY HE PASSED AWAY IN MY CHILDHOOD SO I HAVE NOT HEARD HIS STORIES ABOUT IT NEITHER HE TOLD IT TO ANYBODY ELSE THIS ALL WAS STRICTLY SECRET AND AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER HE WAS NOT EVEN A TALKATIVE PERSON AT ALL THE ONLY EVIDENCE LEFT IS AN OLD OFF PHOTO OF BURAN AND ANERGIA ON BAIKONUR LAUNCHING SITE IT IS BY THE MAIN CONSTRUCTOR THE SIGN SAYS FRIENDS THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT ADVENTURE WE HAD I SUPPOSE IT WAS SIGNED AFTER THE LANDING HERE IS A PICTURE OF MY OLDER BROTHER HOLDING THIS PICTURE THE PHOTO I AM TELLING ABOUT

WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE ANERGIA SURE DOES LOOK LIKE THE ARIANE
REALLY I NEVER KNEW IT FLEW EXCEPT ON THE BACK OF LARGE AIRPLANES
IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT LIKE THE US SPACE SHUTTLE IT WAS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AND DIDN'T REALLY LIVE UP TO THE DESIGN GOALS OF BEING A FULLY REUSABLE CRAFT STILL IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COOL TO SEE TWO DIFFERENT SHUTTLES FLYING AT THE SAME TIME
HEY IT'S ON ONE OF THE PADS DIDN'T KNOW ANERGIA FLEW OUT OF THOSE THE TRIPLE FLAME TRENCH LOOKS SO COOL JUST AFTER IGNITION

A XGUXZ
I RESPECT ALL SCIENTISTS ENGINEERS AND TECHNICIANS BUILDING THIS THING WAS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT WORTHY OF GREAT RESPECT

BUT NOW WITH HINDSIGHT WE REALIZE THE SHUTTLE WAS A FLAWED DESIGN

LOOKS LIKE THE SOVIET ENGINEERS COPIED A FLAWED DESIGN PROBABLY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES

GOOD THING THEY ABANDONED THAT USELESS VEHICLE OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY FUNCTIONAL SPACE STATION NOW
WHAT DOES CCC STANDS FOR I GET CP AT THE END IS PROBABLY FOR COMMUNIST PARTY
RIP RUSSIA SHUTTLE I AM CURIOUS TO SEE HOW IT'S DOING THESE DAYS IF IT WAS MOTHBALLED
IT WAS A GREAT PROGRAM SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE CROSS RANGE OF OUR GIRLS BUT THEIR DESIGN CHANGES AS THEY HAD VERY POOR SRB EXPERIENCE AT THE TIME REALLY INTRIGUED US AT NASA AS WE WERE RECOVERING FROM CHALLENGER AND MAKING OUR OWN MODIFICATIONS
HIS REALLY HAPPENED LIKE IT ACTUALLY FLEW INTO OUTER SPACE NOT BAD WONDER WHY THEY DON'T PICK UP ON THIS PROJECT AGAIN
GOOD POST THE BURAN IS A FASCINATING CHAPTER OF SPACE HISTORY YOU CAN SEE A BURAN VEHICLE AND EVEN GET INSIDE IT AT THE BAIKONUR COSMODROME MUSEUM IN KAZAKHSTAN YOU CAN ALSO VISIT THE LAUNCH PAD WHICH IS REALLY COOL AND A TON OF OTHER SPACE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT DURING A TOUR OF THE BAIKONUR COSMODROME


ANERGIA AND BURAN BOTH LOOK INCREDIBLE I ESPECIALLY LIKE DESIGN
HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO BUY THE ABANDONED BUILDING AND IT'S CONTENTS
I ALWAYS LOVE SEEING HOW GRUNGY EVEN BRAND-NEW SOVIET CONSTRUCTION LOOKED MARXISM IS COMPLETELY PATHETIC
THE STALLINGER CREW CAPSULE LOOKS LIKE IT IS HAVING DIFFICULTIES BUT BOTH BOEING AND SPACE RECENTLY CONFIRMED COMMITMENT TO BE OPERATIONAL BY SPRING THAT MEANS BOTH TEST PROTOTYPES SHOULD BE UNVEILED EARLY NEXT YEAR
IN WASHINGTON STATE BOEING EXPECTS FEW IF ANY JOB LOSSES FROM TODAY S ANNOUNCEMENT SAID SPOKESMAN KEN SMITH

HOWEVER ABOUT WORKERS WILL BE MOVED FROM THE COMPANY S KENT SITE WHICH HAS BEEN SHRINKING FOR SOME YEARS TO TUKWILA

ALL THINGS CONSIDERED COULD BE A LOT WORSE FOR US TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE TO COMMUTE FURTHER ATH
I ALMOST WENT TO KENNEDY A FEW WEEKS AGO DURING MY VACATION IN ORLANDO PLANS GOT REARRANGED BECAUSE OF THE HURRICANE SO KSC UNFORTUNATELY GOT DROPPED FROM THE AGENDA I HAD HEARD ABOUT THIS EXHIBIT AND WAS WONDERING IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE MY SON THROUGH IT NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT WOULD DO TO HIM TO SEE IT BUT BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE IF I WANTED HIM TO SEE ME BREAK DOWN IN TEARS IN A MUSEUM I WAS ELEVEN WHEN CHALLENGER WAS DESTROYED AND IT STILL HURTS IN A BIG WAY WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT FOR TOO LONG
I WAS AT THE CAPE IN JULY FOR CRS AND THIS EXHIBIT WAS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE THING AT KSC MAYBE EVEN BETTER THAN TOURING FIRING ROOM IN THE LAUNCH CONTROL CENTER
THE CHALLENGER DEBRIS SITS NEXT TO ANOTHER DISPLAY CONTAINING SPACE SHUTTLE WINDOW FRAMES

THE ATMOSPHERE INSIDE THE EXHIBIT IS INCREDIBLY REVENANT AND RESPECTFUL I'M AMAZED HOW QUIET IT WAS IN THERE CONSIDERING THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE BROWSING THE ATLANTIS ATTRACTION IN THE SAME BUILDING

I CLEARLY REMEMBER THE WINDOWS ON MY HOUSE SHAKING AS COLOMBIA BROKE UP OVER TEXAS




WITH RESPECT TO MR HAWKING I DOUBT THAT AN INTELLIGENT SPECIES THAT HAS EXISTED FOR AT LEAST YEARS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE EARLIER HUMAN ANCESTORS WOULD WIPE ITSELF OUT IN JUST OVER YEARS AFTER THAT SPECIES UNPRECEDENTED EXPLOSION OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGY

HUMANITY IS JUST BEGINNING TO REALIZE IT'S POTENTIAL
I DO NOT DOUBT THE FACT THAT MR HAWKING IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT PERSON ON EARTH HOWEVER I THINK HE IS PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AND HELPS INSTALL FEAR HIS THEORY HERE IS JUST SPECULATION AFTER ALL
THAT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT THAT VIDEO DID

WHEN IS THEIR FIRST SHIP GOING TO BE BUILT WHEN ARE THEY DOING TEST LAUNCHES WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR GETTING TO MARS THIS IS JUST AN AD FOR BOEING NOT EVEN BOEING SPACECRAFT JUST BOEING
EARTH HAS LIFE WITHOUT THE LIVING TREES PLANTS AND OTHER FLORA OF EARTH THE ENTIRE PLANET WOULD BE DIFFERENT SHADES OF BROWN LIKE JUPITER OR MARS
IN ADDITION TO LIFE CREATING COLOR WE ALSO HAVE A WATER CYCLE WITH DIFFERENT PHASES COMMONLY PRESENT LIQUID WATER IS A MAJOR EROSIVE FORCE WATER VAPOR FORMS CLOUDS AND THE PATTERNS OF ITS MOVEMENT CREATE RAIN ICE COVERS THE POLAR REGIONS AND SNOW COVERS THE MORE TEMPERATE REASONS DURING WINTER

MARS ALSO HAS POLAR CAPS THOUGH MOSTLY COMPOSED OF DRY ICE
IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE PERFECTLY FAR ENOUGH FROM THE SUN TO NOT BE TOO HOT AND CLOSE ENOUGH TO NOT BE A FROZEN TUNDRA

THE GOLDILOCKS ZONE IT'S CALLED
WHY IS THERE NO DIVERSE LAND TYPES OR TERRAINS

OUTSIDE OF FLORA AND LIMESTONE MOST OF TERRAIN IS DUPLICATED ON OTHER PLANETS TO SOME DEGREE MARS HAS VOLCANISM AND USED TO HAVE FLOWING RIVERS IT HAS ICE CAPS TITAN HAS LAKES IF NOT SEAS
I DON'T KNOW WHO OR WHY BUT THE HOW IS PRETTY CLEAR WHAT MAKES EARTH UNIQUE IS ITS MOON
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE EARLIER FALSE COLOR IMAGES OF IT ROTATING LOOKED WAY COOLER THAN THE BLACK AND WHITE ONES NASA HAS BEEN RELEASING LATELY
YOU MISUNDERSTAND THE MOON

ITS TIDE-LOCKED TO THE EARTH NOT THE SUN EVERY POINT IN THE MOON EXCEPT A SMALL AREA NEAR THE POLES GETS A 2 WEEK DAY FOLLOWED BY A 2 WEEK NIGHT WE ERRONEOUSLY CALL THE SIDE OF THE MOON AWAY FROM THE EARTH THAT WE NEVER SEE THE DARK SIDE BUT THATS WRONG ITS JUST THE UNSEEN MOSTLY SIDE EVERY POINT GETS VERY HOT WHEN IN SUN AND VERY COLD WHEN IN DARKNESS BUT THAT DOESNT CHANGE THE SHAPE BECAUSE THE SAME EFFECT OCCURS EVERYWHERE AGAIN EXCEPT FOR A FEW PERMANENTLY SHADOWED AREAS NEAR THE POLES WHICH APPEAR TO CONTAIN ICE


NO YOU DIDN'T
YES AS A MATTER OF FACT IT WOULD WORK SURPRISINGLY WELL ON SATURN GRAVITY IS TOO STRONG AND URANUS OR WINDS WOULD KILL YOUR SHIP AN AIRSHIP IS ALSO GREAT ON VENUS
LANDING AND LAUNCHING ROCKETS FROM AIRSHIPS WOULD BE DIFFICULT BUT AT ITS CORE THE CONCEPT IS WORKABLE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BALLOONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN USED ON VENUS DURING THE VEGA MISSIONS
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE AN AIRSHIP OR A BALLOON FLOATING AROUND ON OF THE GAS GIANTS BUT IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT IT WOULD BE SELF-SUSTAINING AS THERE'S VERY FEW RESOURCES THAT CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM THE AIR
OK SO YOU NEED CAHONCP CARBON HYDROGEN OXYGEN NITROGEN CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS YOU GOT THOSE YOU GOT OF THE HUMAN BODY YOU GOT PLASTICS AND YOU GOT CERAMICS

YOU NEED COPPER IRON SILICON AND WITH THE OTHERS YOU GOT FOR FOOD YOU HAVE MOST OF INDUSTRIAL CIVILIZATION

YOU NEED HEAT PRESSURE GRAVITY

FOR ENERGY YOU NEED NATURAL OCCURRING CHEMICALS SOLAR NUCLEAR

FIND THIS STUFF AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A COLONY ENERGY WOULD BE THE HARDEST I AM BETTING IN A GAS GIANT HEAT EXCHANGERS WOULD BE UNWIELDLY SOLAR MAYBE BLOCKED DOUBT THERE IS A CHEMICAL REACTION YOU CAN EXPLOIT AND FINDING URANIUM IN A CLOUD WOULD BE A CHALLENGE

BUILD A PLATFORM OUT OF PLASTICS HOVER IT VIA BALLONS SET IT AT A HEIGHT TO GIVE EARTH NORMAL GRAVITY PUT OUT A LOT OF STREET LIGHTS TO DEAL WITH THE DARKNESS FIND AN ENERGY REACTION TO USE AND CONGRATULATIONS THE SKY IS NOW THE LIMIT AND IT IS A VERY BIG SKY
WITH OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER IS NO IN OR YEARS ON SOME YOU PROBABLY CAN'T HAVE AN AIRSHIP ON SATURN AS THE WIND SPEEDS ARE TO FAST IT WOULD SHRED ANY SHIP THERE ARE DIAMONDS FLYING AROUND IN THE ATMOSPHERE ON SATURN THAT WOULD RIP THROUGH SHIPS

NEPTUNE AND JUPITER POSSIBLY THE METHOD WOULD BE DIFFICULT THOUGH THE EASIEST TYPE OF AIRSHIP WOULD BE SUSPENDED USING BALLOONS HOWEVER THERE ISN'T ANYTHING YOU COULD FILL THOSE BALLOONS TO CREATE LIFT AS THE ATMOSPHERE OF BOTH PLANETS IS FILLED WITH HELIUM AND HYDROGEN

YOU WOULD NEED AN AIRSHIP BEING LIFTED EITHER WITH SOME FORM OF TECHNOLOGY WE DON'T HAVE OR BY FANS LIKE A DRONE YOU WOULD NEED SOME MASSIVE POWER SUPPLY THOUGH MAYBE NUCLEAR FUSION

GREAT THING ABOUT USING NUCLEAR FUSION ON THOSE PLANETS ARE THAT YOU CAN JUST SCOOP UP THE ATMOSPHERE FOR FUEL

HONESTLY NOW YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH OTHER THINGS SUCH AS THE INCREDIBLY STRONG MAGNETIC FIELD I'M SURE THOSE MAGNETIC FIELDS WOULD MESS WITH YOUR ELECTRONICS
GIVEN THE DIFFERENT EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS THAT WE HAVE ON EARTH THAT STILL HARBOR LIFE IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT LIFE COULD TAKE HOLD ON OTHER PLANETS
MY QUESTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW LIFE FORMS SAY THERE ARE SILICON BASED LIFEFORMS WHO BREATHE IN METHANE AND EXHALE NITROGEN INSTEAD OF CARBON BASED OXYGEN BREATHING OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES

IT ISN'T SPACE IS ABOUT DEGREES KELVIN WHAT PLANET DO YOU KNOW OF THAT IS COLDER THAN THAT
BECAUSE IN SPACE THERE'S NO MEDIUM FOR A HEAT TRANSFER THINGS LIKE GASES AND LIQUIDS PROVIDE A MEANS FOR HEAT TO BE CONDUCTED AWAY FROM SOMETHING
A HUMAN BORN AND RAISED ON MARS WOULD PROBABLY BE TALLER AND WEAKER THAN ONE ON EARTH BUT THOSE ARE NOT DIFFERENT BREEDS THOSE ARE JUST GROWING UP IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS THIS IS AKIN TO SOMEONE GROWING UP INDOORS AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING AROUND IN FIELDS ALL DAY ONE WILL HAVE DARKER SKIN THAN THE OTHER

IN ORDER FOR MUTATIONS TO SET IN IN SUCH A WAY THAT A NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT BREED HAS ARISEN IT WOULD TAKE MANY GENERATIONS AND EVEN THEN THERE WOULD ONLY BE MINOR TRENDS WHICH THEMSELVES COULD BE DIFFUSED DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF SEXUAL SELECTION OVER NATURAL SELECTION PEOPLE MAY PREFER TO BREED SHORT AND STRONG GIVEN THE MORE PHYSICAL NATURE OF AND THE MATERIAL NEEDED FOR EXPOSITS OR PODS IN OTHER WORDS IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME FOR REAL CHANGES TO THE GENOTYPE OF THE SUBSET TO SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE LONG ENOUGH IN FACT THAT OTHER FACTORS WOULD ARISE TO MUDDLE IT UP SUCH AS A REGULAR INFLUX OF NEW COLONISTS FROM EARTH OR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF THE CHANGES SUCH AS WEARING POUNDS OF CLOTHING ON MARS AT ALL TIMES
I HAVE LONG THOUGHT THAT THE GREAT LEAP FOR HUMAN EVOLUTION WON'T HAPPEN ON EARTH LET'S LOOK A THOUSAND YEARS INTO A FUTURE WHERE WE DON'T GET FTL BUT PRESSURES HAVE LED TO HUMANITY SPREADING BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM WE'RE TWENTY LIGHT YEARS OUT SELF-SUFFICIENT BY NECESSITY BUT STRUGGLING IN THESE NEW HOMES PERFECT REPLACEMENT EARTHS ARE HARD TO FIND

WE ADAPT TECHNOLOGICALLY BUT WE ALSO ADAPT PHYSICALLY DIFFERENCES IN GRAVITY RADIATION TEMPERATURE AND ATMOSPHERE MEAN THESE POPULATIONS FACE NEW PRESSURES THERE'S A MINIMUM LAG IN COMMUNICATIONS INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL IS BY GRIMMEST NECESSITY NEVER BY WHIM THE GENETIC FLOW BETWEEN WORLDS IS NONEXISTENT LANGUAGES BEGIN TO CHANGE

FORWARD A FEW THOUSAND YEARS SIMILAR PRESSURES OVERCROWDING RESOURCES ETC LEAD TO ANOTHER PUSH NOW HUMANITY OCCUPIES A VOLUME OF A SPHERE A HUNDRED LIGHT YEARS ACROSS CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTS CHANGES IN CULTURES CHANGES IN HABITS AND CUSTOMS ALONG WITH CONTINUING MUTATION PRESSURE MEAN THAT HUMANITY IS BEGINNING TO FRAGMENT INTO DIFFERENT SPECIES INTERBREEDING BETWEEN HUMANITY'S BRANCHES MIGHT STILL BE POSSIBLE BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF DIFFICULTY REQUIRED FOR THIS TO HAPPEN MEANS IT IS ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATED FROM POSSIBILITY

SOME CIVILIZATIONS HAVE COLLAPSED ALONG THE WAY AND REVERTED TO PRIMITIVE SUBSISTENCE DIGITAL RECORDS REVERT TO WRITING AND EVEN TO ORAL TRADITIONS MYTHOLOGY REPLACES HISTORY THESE CIVILIZATIONS SPIN DOWN THEIR OWN PATHS DISCONNECTED ENTIRELY FROM WHAT WE THINK IT MEANS TO BE HUMAN

FAST FORWARD ANOTHER TEN THOUSAND YEARS THE CHILDREN OF HUMANITY INHABIT EVERY HABITABLE WORLD ORBITING EVERY STAR VISIBLE IN NIGHT SKY FOR EVERY CIVILIZATION THAT HAS SUCCESSFULLY SPREAD TO NEARBY STARS ONE HAS DIED OUT AND TWO HAVE FALLEN BACK INTO PRIMITIVE SOCIETAL STRUCTURES WITH RUDIMENTARY TECHNOLOGY

SEVENTY THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW ON ONE OF THE ORIGINAL COLONY WORLDS INVENT A MEANS OF TRICKING SPACE-TIME THE MOST DISTANT STARS ARE NOW ONLY WEEKS AWAY THE CIVILIZATION TAKES IT UPON THEMSELVES TO REDISCOVER HUMANITY WHAT DO THEY FIND

THEY FIND UNINTELLIGIBLE LANGUAGES WITH NO COMMON ROOT WORDS SPOKEN BY BIPEDS AND A FEW QUADRUPEDS THEY FIND EVERY IMAGINABLE COLOR OF SKIN AND HAIR THEY FIND CHILDREN OF HUMANITY SETTLED ON A WORLD AROUND A RED DWARF WHO SEE IN INFRARED THEY FIND SUBTERRANEAN CHILDREN DRIVEN UNDERGROUND BY OCCASIONAL LETHAL STELLAR FLARES FROM AN OTHERWISE ORDINARY STAR WHO SEE WITH PULSES OF ULTRASOUND THEY FIND CHILDREN WHOSE FEMALES GO INTO OESTRUS EVERY FEW MONTHS THEY FIND CHILDREN THAT HAVE LOST THE ABILITY TO FORM LOGICAL TRAINS OF THOUGHT BIPEDS MORE SIMILAR IN CAPABILITIES TO MACAQUES THAN HUMANS

THEY FIND CULTURES THAT COMMUNICATE WITH RICH SIGNED LANGUAGES THEY FIND CULTURES THAT COMMUNICATE USING WHISTLES

THEY FIND EMPTY RUINS THEY FIND THRIVING CITIES THEY FIND CIVILIZATIONS THEY FIND CIVILIZATIONS THAT HAVE NO TECHNOLOGY BEYOND SMITHING METAL THEY FIND EVERY KIND OF RELIGION AND FLAVOR OF

THEY FIND CIVILIZATIONS THAT HAVE MERGED WITH MACHINES AND CIVILIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN USURPED BY THEM

HUMANITY AND OUR OFFSPRING NOW HAVE SPREAD TO ONE THIRD OF THE GALAXY POPULATIONS SEPARATED BY MORE THAN A FEW THOUSAND YEARS CAN ONLY PRODUCE STERILE OFFSPRING MOST POPULATIONS SEPARATED BY MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND YEARS AS A GENERAL RULE CAN NO LONGER INTERBREED

WE MEET THE ALIENS THEY ARE US IN WAYS THAT STRETCH OUR IMAGINATION

ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE WE'LL EVENTUALLY FIND IT WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO ADD INDEPENDENTLY EVOLVED SENTIENT ALIEN LIFE FOR THIS SCENARIO IT ACTUALLY LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE STAR TREK

EDIT WORDS MOBILE EDITING AND BILL SHATNER PUNCTUATION

TL DR I BELIEVE THAT RADICAL SPECIATION WILL BE A FUNCTION OF MOVING OUTSIDE THE SOLAR SYSTEM SEPARATED BY DISTANCES AND TRAVEL TIMES THAT PROHIBIT GENETIC INTERMINGLING
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH IT WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE THAT LONG EVEN JUST THE FIRST GENERATION WOULD SEE SOME DIFFERENCES IN BONE STRUCTURE AND THE LIKE DURING THEIR GROWTH

PROBLEM BECOMES THOUGH IF THEY GO TO EARTH THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE MUSCLE OR BONE STRENGTH TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN WEIGHT IN THE HIGHER GRAVITY OR AT THE LEAST BE MORE PRONE TO INJURIES

YOU'RE OVERLOOKING THE POSSIBILITY OF DESIGNER BABIES BECOME THE NORM WHICH MAY LEAD TO DIFFERENT BREEDS OF PEOPLE BASED ON DIFFERENT PEOPLE'S VIEW OF THE IDEAL HUMAN BEING CREATED RIGHT HERE ON EARTH
CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME SELECTION PRESSURE AS OTHER SPECIES HAVE YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN FAST TO ESCAPE FROM PREDATORS BECAUSE WE KILLED NEARLY ALL PREDATORS THAT COULD HUNT US AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUN FAST TO HUNT OTHER ANIMALS BECAUSE FOOD IN A SUPERMARKET DOESN'T RUN AWAY

PEOPLE WOULD GROW DIFFERENTLY ON DIFFERENT PLANETS EVEN IN THE FIRST GENERATION BUT THIS IS NOT A GENETIC CHANGE I DON'T SEE WHY TALLER HUMANS WOULD GET MORE CHILDREN ON MARS IF NOT MANY PEOPLE MOVE FROM ONE PLANET TO THE OTHER YOU WOULD GET RANDOM GENETIC DRIFT OVER TIME OVER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS THIS CAN LEAD TO NOTABLE DIFFERENCES

ARTIFICIAL WAYS TO ALTER THE GENETIC CODE CAN SCREW ALL THOSE CONSIDERATIONS OF COURSE AND PRODUCE WHATEVER THE TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS
SEEMS PLAUSIBLE ALTHOUGH IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE QUITE A FEW GENERATIONS FOR THIS TO HAPPEN NOTICEABLY
IF SOMEONE GROWS UP ON MARS THEIR BONES MAY BE TOO WEAK FOR THEM TO EVER WALK ON EARTH WE HAVE NO RESEARCH ON HOW HUMANS DEVELOPMENT WORKS IN SPACE SO WE CAN ONLY GUESS WHAT WILL HAPPEN
THAT'S NOT IT WEALTH WILL CREATE DIFFERENT BREEDS DUE TO GENE MODIFICATION AND IMPLANTS
YES BUT THAT'S ONLY IF HUMAN REPRODUCTION WORKS WITHOUT CREATING ELDRITCH ABOMINATIONS IN LOW GRAVITY
YOU MIGHT WANT TO READ STEPHEN DESTINY'S CHILDREN SERIES OF BOOKS
DOESN'T IT TAKE SOMETHING LIKE A MINIMUM OF GENERATIONS FOR EVEN A TO BECOME DOMINANT AT LEAST IN THINGS LIKE DOGS OR CATTLE SOMEBODY IN THE ANIMAL SCIENCES PLEASE THROW OUT THE NUMBERS HUMANS WOULD HAVE TO PRETTY MUCH FOLLOW THE SAME TIMELINES AS THAT WOULDN'T THEY
THE RL IS AN INSANE ENGINE IT'S BEEN USED FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS AND IS STILL ONE OF THE HIGHEST PERFORMING LIQUID HYDROGEN UPPER SAGE ENGINES IT WILL BE VERY COOL OF IT ENDS UP BEING USED ON THE US SENDING PEOPLE BACK AROUND THE MOON AT LONG LAST

THAT BEING SAID IT IS HIDEOUSLY EXPENSIVE I HOPE THAT WHEN ULA REPLACES IT ON THE ACES UPPER STAGE WE USHER IN A NEW AGE OF UPPER STAGE ENGINES I DOUBT THE MB I'D UP TO THE TASK SO IT WILL PROBABLY BE A BE OR ACOR ENGINE I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE SPECS FOR BOTH
I JUST CAN'T GET OVER THE HEAT AND POWER INSIDE THE ENGINE BUT ICICLES ON THE END OF THE BELL
IF YOU TOUCHED THE EXTERIOR OF THE BELL WOULD YOU BE BURNT OR FROZEN
I WOULD SAY IT MOSTLY HAS TO DO WITH YOUR IMAGINATION BUT THERE WAS CERTAINLY LESS LIGHT POLLUTION THE STARS THEMSELVES WOULDN'T HAVE FADED THAT QUICKLY THOUGH
THERE AREN'T ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THEM IT WAS JUST SOME ARTISTIC LICENCE WITH PATTERNS THEY COULD SEE IN THE SKY
CONSTELLATIONS ARE ARTIFICIAL PATTERNS RESULTING FROM SOMETHING CALLED PAREIDOLEA THE HUMAN BEHAVIOR OF SEEING PATTERNS THAT AREN'T THERE EVERY CIVILIZATION THAT LOOKED INTO THE NIGHT SKY SAW THEIR OWN CONSTELLATIONS THE ANCIENT CHINESE CONSTELLATIONS ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT ALTHOUGH THE GROUPING OF LARGER BRIGHTER STARS MAKES SOME OF THE STAR GROUPING STICK FIGURE OUTLINE SIMILAR WITH A DIFFERENT STORY

ANCIENT CHINESE CONSTELLATIONS HETP

IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF RESEARCH TO COLLECT ALL THE CONSTELLATION PATTERNS FROM EVERY SOCIETY THAT DEVELOPED THEM THEN OVERLAY THEM ON OUR MODERN CONSTELLATIONS TO SEE HOW CLOSE THE STAR GROUPINGS MATCH UP HUMANS HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND TO SEE MUCH STAR PATTERN VARIATION A NEARBY SUPER NOVA HERE AND THERE RELATIVE POSITIONAL CHANGE DUE TO PRECESSION IN THE ROTATION AXIS
WORTH WATCHING A REMINDER OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN MISSING FOR THE LAST YEARS
THANKS FOR THE SHARE I WAS INVOLVED IN CREATING THIS FILM I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
LAST EVER SINCE WE KNOW THAT THE MANNED MISSION TO MARS WILL BE CANCELLED AS WELL AS ANYTHING SCHEDULED FOR THE MOON


VERY FINE MISSION FILM NEED THE MUSIC THE VOICES AND THE SILENT SPACE GETS MASKED
CHECK OUT THAT LADY'S HAIR AT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EXACTLY WHAT WE SEE FROM THE ISS VIDEOS SANS THE SHAKING OF THE AIRCRAFT IN THIS VIDEO IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE TO PEOPLE WHO THINK NASA IS THE ULTIMATE BAD GUY IN TERMS OF A MULTIPLE OF CONSPIRACIES THE HAIR STANDING UP LIKE THAT IS ONE OF THE EVIDENCES THEY USE TO SAY THAT THE ISS IS FAKE WHEN GRAVITY TAKES A HOLD AGAIN HER HAIR FALLS DOWN JUST LIKE WE'D EXPECT

THIS IS ANOTHER BLOW IF IT'S REALLY NEEDED FOR THE CONSPIRATARDS
RAGING ENGINEERING BONER AT THOSE SEXY RD EXHAUST PLUMES THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC ENGINES AND WERE AHEAD OF WHAT AMERICAN ROCKET PROPULSION HAD TO OFFER STILL ARE IN SOME RESPECTS IT'S A SHAME THAT THE RD IS SO POLITICALLY TAINTED

ON THE OTHER HAND IT'LL BE REALLY COOL WATCHING THE NEW METHALOX ROCKETS TAKE FLIGHT WITH BLUISH EXHAUST PLUMES AND CLEARER SHOCK DIAMONDS
FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED SCOTT MANLEY HAS AN INTERESTING VIDEO ON HOW AND WHY ATLAS V FLIES WITH ODD NUMBERS OF ARBS

WISH YOU'D CREDIT THE PHOTOGRAPHER JARED HAWORTH U JARDON INSTEAD OF JUST SHAMELESSLY REPASTING HIS AWESOME WORK CHECK OUT FOR MORE AWESOME ROCKET PHOTOS FROM HIM AND HIS COLLEAGUES
AS THE ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPHER WHO SHOT THIS IMAGE I WANTED TO DROP IN AND PROVIDE A FEW DETAILS I'M A PHOTOGRAPHER PHOTO EDITOR FOR WE REPORT SPACE HETP A CREDENTIALED NEWS AGENCY MADE UP OF FORMER NASA SOCIAL ALUMNI COVERING AMERICAN SPACEFLIGHT

THIS IS A PHOTO OF THE ATLAS V ROCKET LIFTING NRL TO ORBIT HETP ON JULY FROM SPACE LAUNCH COMPLEX CAPE CANAVERAL AIR FORCE STATION FLORIDA

I'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF ENGINE CLOSEUP PHOTOS BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D SUCCESSFULLY EXPOSED FOR THE DETAIL IN THE SRB PLUME THE PHOTO WAS SHOT USING A CANON AND AN F SHORT TELEPHOTO PRIME LENS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FEET FROM THE ROCKET EXPOSURE WAS ISO F AT NO FILTERS WERE USED FORTUNATELY THE LENS'S FRONT GLASS DIDN'T SUFFER ANY ILL EFFECTS FROM THE SRB EXHAUST AT THIS LAUNCH BUT I DID HAVE TO REPLACE IT AFTER HETP

THE LAUNCH WAS JUST AFTER SUNRISE IN LATE JULY SO SOME OF THE LIGHT HITTING THE ROCKET IS FROM THE SUN ILLUMINATING THE SIDE FACING THE CAMERA BUT THE BULK OF THE LIGHT IN THIS PHOTO IS FROM THE ENGINES THEMSELVES

IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN SEEING MORE PICTURES LIKE THIS CHECK OUT OUR INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT OR OUR FACEBOOK PAGE EARLIER THIS YEAR WE PUBLISHED A BOOK ALSO CALLED WE REPORT SPACE OF LAUNCH PHOTOS AND PERSONAL ANECDOTES FROM NASA SOCIAL ALUMNI COVERING THE PERIOD FROM MARCH DECEMBER INCLUDING THE FIRST LAUNCH OF ORION CAPSULE ON THE EFT MISSION HETP AND ORBCOMM RETURN TO FLIGHT AND FIRST RETURN TO LAUNCH SITE LANDING HETP AT LZ YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT OUR BOOK FROM OUR WEBSITE LINKED ABOVE OR CONTACT ME FOR MORE INFORMATION
BEAUTIFUL PICTURE BUT I HAVE A QUESTION THE SRB EXHAUST IS EXPANDING OUT OF THE NOZZLE DOESN'T THIS MEAN THE NOZZLE HAS THE WRONG EXPANSION ANGLE BAD FLOW SEPARATION AND SINCE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE WILL BE DROPPING AS IT GETS UP THIS EXPANSION WILL BE GETTING BIGGER SHOULDN'T THEY BE STARTING COMPRESSED LIKE THE MAIN ENGINES TO ACHIEVE EXPANSION AT SOME OPTIMAL ALTITUDE
ROCKET ENGINES BURNING FUEL SO FAST UP INTO THE NIGHT SKY THEY BLAST
THE FIRE FROM THE ROCKET LOOKS LIKE A LIQUID IT'S SORT OF BEAUTIFUL
IS THAT CONDUIT LOOKING LINE ALONG THE SIDE OF THE SRB IS THE FTS SYSTEM
THAT'S JUST PURE UNADULTERATED HATRED FOR GRAVITY FLOWING OUT THE ASS END OF THAT ROCKET
THERE WILL BE AN ATLAS V LAUNCH THIS SATURDAY NOV IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED


I KNOW THEY DON'T DESIGN ROCKETS TO LOOK PRETTY BUT DAMN ATLAS V ESPECIALLY THE CONFIDES SURE LOOK LIKE THEY DID
HOW DOES ALL THE THRUST FROM THESE ENGINES GET TRANSFERRED TO THE SHUTTLE IT'S SELF

DID SOME OF THE INSULATION ON THE MAIN TANK COME OFF THAT LOOKS INTERESTING
HERE'S A SOURCE

WEREPORTSPACE

I THINK IT'S LIKE A DAD AND HIS DAUGHTER TAKING ALL THESE PHOTOS
SOYUZ WILL ALSO USE METHANE ENGINE AND RUSSIA DID HAVE SEVERAL OLD METHANE ENGINE ON TOP OF SOME EARLY PROPOSAL TO HAVE METHANE ENGINE SEVERAL YEARS AGO BEFORE FINALLY DECIDE TO GO AHEAD WITH ENTIRE NEW ROCKET

SOYUZ FELIX FIRST FLIGHT TARGET IS

NELS FIRST FLIGHT WILL EARLIER BUT VERY CLOSE TO SOYUZ BOTH WILL BE FIRST GEN LARGE METHANE ENGINE ROCKET

TOPIC
Q WHICH PARTS OF THE ATLAS V ARE REUSABLE

A WUT IT WORKS THAT'S ENOUGH FOREVER NOW GIVE ME MORE TAX MONEY SO I CAN BUY A ROCKET FOR
SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER AT LIFTOFF
TOO BAD WE HAVEN'T FOUND A BETTER WAY TO GET OFF PLANET LIKE USING AN ANTI GRAVITY DRIVE OR SOMETHING I MEAN COME ON WERE LIVING THE FUTURE
THE TITAN WILL BE EVEN BETTER THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE CANCELED NAVAJO
IT'S KIND OF SURREAL TO SEE OUR ATMOSPHERE FROM THIS ANGLE IT'S A HAUNTING REMINDER OF HOW SMALL IT REALLY IS IN COMPARISON TO THE VASTNESS OF THE PLANET AND HOW EASY IT IS TO SCREW THINGS UP
R TELESCOPES

READ THE STICKED POST THERE IT'S REALLY NOT WORTH BUYING SOMETHING IN THE RANGE REALLY IF YOU WANT TO GET A TELESCOPE WORTH BUYING YOU WILL NEED TO SPEND ROUGHLY THE AWB ONISKEY TELESCOPE IS PROBABLY THE BEST CHOICE FOR ALL-AROUND BOOB USE AT THAT PRICE RANGE BUT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO FIND A MUCH BETTER SCOPE USED

SERIOUSLY THOUGH HEAD OVER TO THAT SUB
I DONT HAVE TOO MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH DIFFERENT TELESCOPES BUT AN IN REFLECTOR SHOULD BE IN YOUR BUDGET I HAVE AN AND IT'S GREAT FOR AMATEUR ASTRONOMY
JUST DON'T GO CHEAP I DID AND REGRETTED IT SO MUCH IT WAS TERRIBLE I THINK I SPENT LESS THAN
LOOKS MORE LIKE STRATUS OR DUST PARTICULARLY IN THE EXTREME LOWER LEFT OF THE IMAGE
IT'D BE PRETTY COMPARABLE YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY CLOSE TO AN INCREDIBLY STRONG GRAVITATIONAL FIELD BEFORE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE NOTICED

LAZY TO DO THE MATHS NOW BUT IT WOULD BE UNDER DIFFERENCE PER EARTH YEAR

WHAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE NOTICEABLE FOR ANY FUTURE HUMANS THERE IS THE DIFFERENCE IN DAY YEAR LENGTH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
