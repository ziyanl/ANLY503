WHAT ABOUT SLAVDOM ZIZEL


IT WAS A PLEASURE TO WATCH TAKE ON CRITICAL THINKING AT KHAN ACADEMY WOULD LOVE TO ASK QUESTIONS THANKS FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENTS
BEING A STUDENT AT UA I'VE SAT IN ON A FEW CONVERSATIONS WITH KENNETH WAS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THIS LIST BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO RECOMMEND HIM FOR AN AMA

WAY TO BEAT ME TO IT YOU GUYS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS


EDIT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET A FEW OTHERS INVOLVED IF ANYONE HAS ANYBODY ELSE AT UA THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE
SHOULD I MAJOR IN PHILOSOPHY AND WHAT KIND OF CAREERS WOULD IT OPEN ME UP TO
REMOVED
COULD YOU TRY TO HAVE PAGE EAST DIGESTER TO DO AN AMA HERE AS WELL
SO CONTRACTARIANISM NECESSARILY RULES OUT THINGS LIKE SLAVERY

NOT SO FAST TWO TREATISES CAME AFTER LEVIATHAN AND DIRECTLY SUPPORTED SLAVERY AS DID LOCKE HIMSELF

WHEN HOBBES MENTIONS SLAVES IN LEVIATHAN HE ISN'T TALKING ABOUT AFRICAN SLAVES HE IS TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO FIND THEIR WAY INTO YOUR SOCIETY BY YOUR CONQUEST OF THEIR LANDS AND CONQUERED PEOPLES ENTER INTO A SOCIAL CONTRACT OF SO-CALLED SLAVERY WHEN THEY SURRENDER

DOMINION ACQUIRED BY CONQUEST OR VICTORY IN WAR IS THAT WHICH SOME WRITERS CALL DESPOTICAL FROM DESPOTES WHICH SIGNIFIETH A LORD OR MASTER AND IS THE DOMINION OF THE MASTER OVER HIS SERVANT AND THIS DOMINION IS THEN ACQUIRED TO THE VICTOR WHEN THE VANQUISHED TO AVOID THE PRESENT STROKE OF DEATH COVENANTETH EITHER IN EXPRESS WORDS OR BY OTHER SUFFICIENT SIGNS OF THE WILL THAT SO LONG AS HIS LIFE AND THE LIBERTY OF HIS BODY IS ALLOWED HIM THE VICTOR SHALL HAVE THE USE THEREOF AT HIS PLEASURE AND AFTER SUCH COVENANT MADE THE VANQUISHED IS A SERVANT AND NOT BEFORE FOR BY THE WORD SERVANT WHETHER IT BE DERIVED FROM SERVICE TO SERVE OR FROM SERVAGE TO SAVE WHICH I LEAVE TO GRAMMARIANS TO DISPUTE IS NOT MEANT A CAPTIVE WHICH IS KEPT IN PRISON OR BONDS TILL THE OWNER OF HIM THAT TOOK HIM OR BOUGHT HIM OF ONE THAT DID SHALL CONSIDER WHAT TO DO WITH HIM FOR SUCH MEN COMMONLY CALLED SLAVES HAVE NO OBLIGATION AT ALL BUT MAY BREAK THEIR BONDS OR THE PRISON AND KILL OR CARRY AWAY CAPTIVE THEIR MASTER JUSTLY BUT ONE THAT BEING TAKEN HATH CORPORAL LIBERTY ALLOWED HIM AND UPON PROMISE NOT TO RUN AWAY NOR TO DO VIOLENCE TO HIS MASTER IS TRUSTED BY HIM

FURTHERMORE SINCE YOU WOULD HAVE DIED IN WAR HAD YOU NOT SURRENDERED TO THE VICTOR YOU ARE SURRENDERING EVERYTHING INCLUDING YOUR LIFE TO THEM

THE MASTER OF THE SERVANT IS MASTER ALSO OF ALL HE HATH AND MAY EXACT THE USE THEREOF THAT IS TO SAY OF HIS GOODS OF HIS LABOUR OF HIS SERVANTS AND OF HIS CHILDREN AS OFTEN AS HE SHALL THINK FIT FOR HE HILDRETH HIS LIFE OF HIS MASTER BY THE COVENANT OF OBEDIENCE THAT IS OF OWNING AND AUTHORISING WHATSOEVER THE MASTER SHALL DO AND IN CASE THE MASTER IF HE REFUSE KILL HIM OR CAST HIM INTO BONDS OR OTHERWISE PUNISH HIM FOR HIS DISOBEDIENCE HE IS HIMSELF THE AUTHOR OF THE SAME AND CANNOT ACCUSE HIM OF INJURY

LOCKE EVENTUALLY USES THIS ARGUMENT IN A WAY TO JUSTIFY SLAVERY IN TWO TREATISES SIMILARLY LOCKE CALLS THE SAME CONQUERED PEOPLES SLAVES AND ISN'T TALKING ABOUT THOSE FROM AFRICA SURPRISINGLY YOU DON'T SEE THE JUSTIFICATION FOR AFRICAN SLAVES IN THE CHAPTER ON SLAVERY IT IS SEEN IT IN THE CHAPTER OF THE STATE OF NATURE

A STATE ALSO OF EQUALITY WHEREIN ALL THE POWER AND JURISDICTION IS RECIPROCAL NO ONE HAVING MORE THAN ANOTHER THERE BEING NOTHING MORE EVIDENT THAN THAT CREATURES OF THE SAME SPECIES AND RANK PROMISCUOUSLY BORN TO ALL THE SAME ADVANTAGES OF NATURE AND THE USE OF THE SAME FACULTIES SHOULD ALSO BE EQUAL ONE AMONGST ANOTHER WITHOUT SUBORDINATION OR SUBJECTION UNLESS THE LORD AND MASTER OF THEM ALL SHOULD BY ANY MANIFEST DECLARATION OF HIS WILL SET ONE ABOVE ANOTHER AND CONFER ON HIM BY AN EVIDENT AND CLEAR APPOINTMENT AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO DOMINION AND SOVEREIGNTY

THIS IS NOT AN EQUALITY OF ALL PEOPLES BUT AN EQUALITY OF PEOPLE BORN TO THE SAME RANK SAME ADVANTAGES OF NATURE AND USE OF THE SAME FACULTIES LOCKE AND MANY OTHERS DID NOT SEE SLAVES AS FITTING INTO THIS EQUALITY CLASS OR EVEN WOMEN IT WASN'T UNTIL THE SOCIAL COMPACT THAT SUCH A CONTRACT EXTENDING TO EVERY LIVING HUMAN WAS MADE EXPLICIT
DAMN YOU HOBBES WHO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT BUT IS RIGHT
I REALLY HOPE THEY WILL FINISH THESE EPISODES SOON I WATCH TO WATCH THEM ALL AT ONCE NOT WAIT FOR THEM TO BECOME AVAILABLE
I DIDN'T SEE WHAT GAME THEORY HAD TO DO WITH CONTRACTARIANISM PRISONERS THEORY BEING BASED OFF OF A CONTRACT YOU MAKE WITH YOUR PARTNER IN CRIME I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT WAS THAT THERE WAS NO CONTRACT ITS BEST JUST TO LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF
CONTRACTARIANISM COMES SO CLOSE TO HITTING MY PERSONAL PHILOSOPHICAL SYSTEM AND YET SOMEHOW FEELS NEAR THE EXACT OPPOSITE

I PLACE NO VALUE IN THE IMPLICIT CONTRACT VERBAL WRITTEN ANY FORM OF COMMUNICATED CONTRACT IS IN MY EYES NEAR THE HIGHEST MORAL FORM NOT REALLY THE GREATEST GOOD BUT TRUMPING THE GREATEST GOOD IN TERMS OF PRAGMATIC ALLOWANCE THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT LEAVES ROOM FOR THE FALLIBILITY

2 WILLING PARTIES PARTICIPATING IN A PREVIOUSLY AGREED UPON SYSTEM GO FOR IT I'LL BE SAD IF IT'S MURDER OR TORTURE OR WHATEVER BUT AS LONG AS ALL PARTICIPANTS SIGNED UP FOR IT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO STAND IN THEIR WAY

HOWEVER THE IMPLICIT SOCIAL CONTRACT I PUT NO STOCK IN THAT LOOKING AT IT IN TERMS OF SOMETHING LIKE ETIQUETTE THERE ARE COUNTLESS CONDITIONS AT WORK THAT IT IS NOT REASONABLE TO EXPECT EVERYONE TO KNOW NOR IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO KNOW IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES THEY CHANGE BETWEEN CULTURES AND SUBCULTURES AND TO JUDGE SOMEONE ACCORDING TO THESE TERMS IS JUST TO BE PROUD OF HOW INGRAINED YOU ARE INTO ONE SMALL SYSTEM OUT OF MANY

THE SAME CONCEPT APPLIES TO LAW WITH THE ADDED COMPLICATION OF THE ARGUMENT YOU LIVE IN THIS SOCIETY YOU OBEY ITS LAWS MAYBE FOR PEOPLE WHO OPTED INTO IT BUT NOT FOR THE PEOPLE BORN INTO IT THEY NEVER AGREED TO THEIR OWN BIRTH SO THERE IS NO PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED CONTRACT
THE CRASH COURSE PEOPLE ALWAYS DO A GREAT JOB
I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS AN AMAZING SERIES
I ENJOYED THE LESSON BUT THE WHOLE TIME I WAS THINKING AT THE BACK OF MY MIND THAT CONTRACTARIANISM ONLY WORKS BETWEEN THOSE OF EQUAL POWER EVEN THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA HAS AN ELEMENT OF A POWER STRUGGLE THAT FORCED A CONTRACT IT IS ULTIMATELY JUST A GAME OF WHO BLINKS FIRST WITH FORCED BOUNDARIES RIGHT AS THE WORLD GOES IS ONLY IN QUESTION BETWEEN EQUALS IN POWER WHILE THE STRONG DO WHAT THEY CAN AND THE WEAK SUFFER WHAT THEY MUST THUCYDIDES I WONDER IF CONTRACTARIANISM OR THE PRISONER'S DILEMMA CAN BE REDEFINED IN TERMS OF A SWOT ANALYSIS
INTERESTING I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THIS WAY
CRASH COURSE IS AWESOME
TOO BAD CONTRACTUALISM IS MUCH BETTER AND MORE PLAUSIBLE
IS CONTRACTARIANISM NOT AUTOMATICALLY INVALIDATED BY THE LACK OF ANOTHER CHOICE IE A PLACE TO GO WHERE YOU IF YOU WANT TO CAN LIVE IN THE HOBBESIAN HOBBESIAN HOBBISTICAL NATURAL WORLD EVERY PIECE OF LAND ON EARTH IS EITHER TAKEN OR INHOSPITABLE AND ALL THE TAKEN PARTS HAVE THEIR OWN MORAL CONTRACTS DIFFERING FROM EACH OTHER BUT STILL EXISTENT I ARGUE THIS BECAUSE IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM AND ERGO IN SOME SENSE OUR MORALITY IF OUR HAND IS FORCED INTO A CONTRACT THEN IT IS DOES THIS MEAN THAT FOLLOWING CONTRACTARIANISM THAT WE ARE ALL SLAVES ONLY WE HAVE THE CHOICE OF OUR SLAVER BEING THE COUNTRY WE LIVE IN
I'M FINDING THIS DICTION PRESENTATION AND RHETORICAL STYLE INCREASINGLY HANDWAVY AND ANNOYING WITH EVERY VIDEO I COME ACROSS YEAR BY YEAR
GREAT BOOK ON EBAY

HEY ROY

WHEN IS OUR NEXT PARADOXES AND INFINITY HOMEWORK DUE COULD YOU SEND OUT A REVISED SYLLABUS

U STUDYINGLOGIC WROTE

I'M A STUDENT INTERESTED IN FORMAL MODELS OF RATIONALITY CURRENTLY APPLYING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO TO A PHILOSOPHY GRADUATE SCHOOL WITH A STRONG BASIS IN FORMAL EPISTEMOLOGY OR A COMPUTER SCIENCE GRADUATE SCHOOL

DEPENDS IF YOU WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON HOW ACTUAL HUMAN DO OR SHOULD REASON THEN PROBABLY PHILOSOPHY IF YOU ARE MORE INTERESTED IN STUDYING HOW FORMAL ALGORITHMIC SYSTEMS MIGHT MANAGE DATA I EAST THINK IN A RATIONAL WAY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT WAY IS SIMILAR TO HOW WE ACTUAL HUMANS REASON THEN COMPUTER SCIENCE WOULD PERHAPS BE BETTER MY REAL ADVICE WOULD BE THAT IF YOU AREN T SURE YOU CAN ALWAYS DO A PHD IN ONE AND A MASTERS IN THE OTHER

WHICH AREAS IN PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS DO YOU THINK ARE MORE CLOSED OFF TO ACADEMICS COMING FROM PURE MATHEMATICS INSTEAD OF PHILOSOPHY AS IT ISN'T COMMON DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON APPROACHING GRADUATE PROGRAMS FOR A FOCUS SPECIFICALLY IN PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS THANKS
U WULLBELL ALSO ASKED

I SEEM TO RECALL A FAMOUS FREGE SCHOLAR GETTING INVOLVED IN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM BECAUSE OF NOTORIOUS RACISM AMONG OTHER THINGS AND WHILE I'M NOT SURE I'D GO THAT FAR DO YOU SEE ANY REASON TO SORT OF COME BACK DOWN AND PUT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AS INTERESTING AS CANTOR'S PROOF MAY BE ONE OF THE FEARS I HAVE ABOUT GOING INTO PHILOSOPHY IS THAT I WON'T BE HELPING ANYBODY VERY MUCH THIS FEELS LIKE MORE OF AN ISSUE WITH LOGIC AND PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS THAN OTHER FIELDS OF PHILOSOPHY EAST G VALUE THEORY SOCIALLY RELEVANT PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE ETC WHILE I QUITE OFTEN FIND MYSELF GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE MATERIAL OF DIFFERENT FIELDS OUT OF INTEREST I HAVE A HARD TIME CONVINCING MYSELF IT WOULD BE GOOD TO DO PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS FULL TIME

I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY MICHAEL DUMMETT YOU ARE THINKING OF ALTHOUGH I WASN T AWARE THAT HIS DISCOVERY THAT FREGE WAS ANTI-SEMITIC WAS THE REASON HE PARTICIPATED IN VARIOUS KINDS OF SOCIALLY PROGRESSIVE STUFF I DO THINK THAT ENGAGING WITH THE REAL WORLD AND WORKING TO MAKE IT BETTER IS IMPORTANT IT S ONE OF THE REASONS BUT NOT THE ONLY REASON I HAVE BECOME INTERESTED IN FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY AND CRITICAL RACE THEORY IN RECENT YEARS BUT I DON T THINK THAT WE SHOULD UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFERENCE THAT WORK ON PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS OR LOGIC MIGHT MAKE IN SUCH MATTERS IT MIGHT BE A SMALLER CONTRIBUTION BUT PART OF THE REASON FOR MANY OF THE BAD THINGS WE SEE IN THE WORLD IS THAT PEOPLE DON T THINK CLEARLY AND CAREFULLY ABOUT A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES OFTEN ISSUES THAT THEY ARE EMOTIONALLY CONNECTED TO HENCE ANY WORK THAT HELPS PEOPLE TO THINK MORE CLEARLY CAN ALSO BE POSITIVE IN THIS SENSE AND I THINK SOME OF WHAT WE DO IN PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS AND LOGIC ESPECIALLY IN TEACHING LOGIC MAKES POSITIVE IMPACTS IN THIS SENSE THE IMPACT MIGHT BE LESS DIRECT AND LESS NOTICEABLE THAN GOING OUT AND PROTESTING OR MARCHING OR SOMETHING BUT THAT DOESN T MEAN IT ISN T A REAL GENUINE GOOD AND JUST BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE A SMALLER IMPACT DOESN T MEAN IT ISN T WORTH MAKING AFTER ALL PRESUMABLY WE CAN DO THE BIG THINGS AND THE SMALL THINGS TOO

U BRANDO WROTE

HEY DR COOK HOW DO WE INCREASE THE IMAGE OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS IN MATH AND PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENTS IN THE MIDWEST IT SEEMS TO BE VERY LACKING IN MINNESOTA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA I JUST FIND IT FRUSTRATING TO DO ANY RESEARCH BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY LONELY ISLAND IN THE MIDWEST IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS

I THINK YOU MIGHT BE UNDERESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF AMAZING PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS IN THE MIDWEST IN ADDITION TO THE PROGRAM AT MINNESOTA THERE ARE EXCELLENT SOME WOULD ARGUE EVEN BETTER PROGRAMS AT OHIO STATE NOTRE DAME AND CARNEGIE MELLON LIKEWISE THERE ARE LOTS OF REALLY GOOD PHILOSOPHERS OF MATHEMATICS FLOATING AROUND THE MIDWEST AT SMALLER UNIVERSITIES THAT DON T HAVE GRADUATE PROGRAMS TO GIVE BUT ONE EXAMPLE JANET DOLINA AT MCALESTER COLLEGE JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM THE U OF MINNESOTA IS IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE BEST HISTORIANS OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS ANYWHERE

I THINK MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT COMICS IS HOW ADAPTABLE AND MALLEABLE THEY ARE BATMAN IS ADAM WEST BEN AFFLECK KEVIN CONROY NEAL ADAMS AND FRANK MILLER AND GRANT MORRISON AND BILL FINGER HE CAN BE ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF BATMAN AND STILL BE BATMAN

WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS MEANS FOR THE FUTURE OF COMIC BOOKS ARE THESE STORIES JUST GOING TO KEEP GOING AND KEEP CHANGING DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE MORE TO SAY

U WILLABEL ASKED

HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT LOGICAL PLURALISM IF YOU'RE NOT A FAN WHAT LOGICAL SYSTEM DO YOU LIKE

I HAVE WRITTEN A LOT ON LOGICAL PLURALISM AND DISCUSSED PARTIALLY DEFENDED TWO VERSIONS

THE FIRST KNOWN AS LOGIC AS MODELLING STEMS FROM THE IDEA THAT FORMAL LOGICS ARE JUST MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF CORRECT NATURAL LANGUAGE REASONING AND HENCE ANY LOGIC THAT DOES A GOOD JOB IS A LEGITIMATE I EAST GOOD OR CORRECT LOGIC OBVIOUSLY EVEN FOR THE SAME EXPLANATORY TASK TWO DISTINCT SUCH LOGICS I EAST MATHEMATICAL MODELS MIGHT DO EQUALLY GOOD JOBS AS MODELS IN THIS SENSE

THE SECOND VERSION I HAVE EXPLORED STEMS FROM OBSERVATIONS LIKE THE FOLLOWING IF WE ACCEPT A LOGIC AS THE CORRECT CODIFICATION OF LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OR OR OF CORRECT NATURAL LANGUAGE REASONING THEN PRESUMABLY THE CONTEXT OF THAT LOGIC IS THE CONTEXT WITHIN WITHIN WHICH WE SHOULD FORMULATE AND STUDY LOGICAL PLURALISM MONISM ITSELF THIS SUGGESTS THAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE ANY REAL WAY OF DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN RELATIVELY CLOSE LOGICS SINCE FOR EXAMPLE INTUITIONISTIC LOGIC AND OTHER SO-CALLED LOGICS MIGHT LOOK EQUALLY GOOD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN INTUITIONISTIC THEORY OF WHAT LOGIC IS AND IS SUPPOSED TO DO AND HENCE THE INTUITIONIST MIGHT HAVE NO REAL EVIDENCE TO REJECT THE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LOGIC IN FAVOR OF INTUITIONISTIC LOGIC

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND IN MY OPINION WHEN THINKING ABOUT LOGICAL PLURALISM IS TO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF THINKING THAT THE CLAIM THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE GOOD LOGIC ENTAILS THAT ANY LOGIC WHATSOEVER IS EQUALLY GOOD AS A FRIEND OF MINE ONCE PUT IT AFTER HEARING A TALK I GAVE ON THE SECOND VERSION ABOVE SO NOW YOU RE A LOGICAL PLURALIST BUT CLASSICAL LOGIC DOESN T EVEN GET TO BE ONE OF THE GOOD LOGICS
U SYNDICATE WROTE
ALSO I AM CURRENTLY TAKING AN INTRODUCTORY AESTHETICS COURSE AT MY SCHOOL I WOULD SAY COMICS ARE ART BUT COULD A COMIC EVER BE CONSIDERED HIGH ART HIGH ART MEANING VIEWED AS ONE OF THE GREAT EST WORKS OF ART

I CERTAINLY THINK A COMIC COULD BE ONE OF THE GREATEST WORKS OF ART AT LEAST IN PRINCIPLE I THINK THAT COMICS AS A RELATIVELY NEW ART FORM HAS PERHAPS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED ENOUGH TO HAVE ANY EXAMPLES OF THIS YET AND I THINK THE OVERTLY COMMERCIAL AND OF MAINSTREAM COMICS FOR MOST OF ITS HISTORY HAS HAMPERED THIS DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY WORKS THAT ARE WORTHY OF BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS IMPORTANT ART WORKS EVEN IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT WORKS BY GRANT MORRISON CHRIS WARE JOOST SWARE AND MANY OTHERS COME TO MIND HERE OH AND ALSO PEANUTS DEFINITELY PEANUTS

HEY
I'VE BEEN OUT OF ACADEMIA FOR ABOUT YEARS BUT STILL TRY TO KEEP UP TO DATE AND ENGAGE WITH RELEVANT WORK PERHAPS YOU COULD SHARE YOUR VIEW ON SOME OF THESE THINGS


IS ONTIC STRUCTURAL REALISM EAST G MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURAL REALISM LOGICALLY POSSIBLE I EAST CAN THERE BE RELATIONS WITHOUT RELATA

2 WHAT IS YOUR PREFERRED INTERPRETATION OF SCIENTIFIC THEORIES SYNTACTIC SENTENCES IN WITH PREDICATE LOGIC OR SEMANTIC MODELS AND CATEGORY THEORY

EXTENDING ON THE PREVIOUS POINT I'VE BEEN PONDERING PUTTING SOME TIME INTO RESEARCHING THE APPLICABILITY OF HOMOTOPY TYPE THEORY IN OF EMPIRICAL SCIENCES DO YOU THINK THAT IDEA MIGHT HAVE POTENTIAL

DO YOU THINK RENORMALIZATION IN QUANTUM MECHANICS IS EPISTEMICALLY AND METHODOLOGICALLY KOSHER OR DOES IT COUNT AGAINST ITS COHERENCE PARSIMONY

THE THEOREM HELD SOME RATHER UNINTUITIVE AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSEQUENCES IN STORE FOR THE LOGICIANS OF THE EARLY CENTURY BOOTSTRAPPING MODEL THEORY AND RESHAPING OUR NOTIONS OF SATISFIABILITY AND EVEN COUNTABILITY SO I'M AWARE OF ITS GENERAL INFLUENCE AND MEANING BUT I FIND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME SUMMARIZING ITS SIGNIFICANCE FOR OUR NOTIONS OF DECIDABILITY AND IN TURN COMPUTABILITY CAN YOU HELP ME OUT


THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
U ODIONBUCKLEY WROTE

I LOVE COMICS LIKE THIS IN PARTICULAR YOU'VE REMINDED ME OF ONE OF MY FAVORITES A GREYSHIRT STORY BY ALAN MOORE AND RICK VEITCH EACH PAGE IS A STACK OF PANELS WITH EACH PANEL TELLING THE STORY OF THE RESIDENTS OF THAT RESPECTIVE FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING OVER DIFFERENT ERAS OF TIME I DON'T HAVE MY BOOKS AT WORK WITH ME TO GIVE A BETTER CITATION IT AMAZED ME BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST STORY I'D EVER SEEN THAT COULD IN A LITERAL SENSE ONLY BE TOLD THROUGH THE MEDIUM ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THIS ONE AND IF SO DO YOU HAVE ANY INTERESTING PHILOSOPHICAL INSIGHTS ABOUT IT I HAVE NO BACKGROUND IN PHILOSOPHY FOR CONTEXT

I AM FAMILIAR WITH IT AND LOVE IT THE MAIN INSIGHT I WOULD PRESS WHICH IS MORE OF A RECOMMENDATION FOR GOING BACK TO THE COMIC IN ORDER TO WORK OUT MORE FOR YOURSELF RATHER THAN ME TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK THE COMIC IS ABOUT IS THIS TIME AND THE REPRESENTATION OF TIME WORKS VERY WEIRDLY IN COMICS COMICS SCHOLAR SCOTT MCCLOUD HAS WRITTEN MORE THAN ONCE I THINK THAT IN COMICS SPACE TIME I THINK THIS COMIC VERY NICELY ILLUSTRATES THIS IDEA BUT ALSO ILLUSTRATES HOW COMPLICATED THIS IDEA IS HERE SPACE ON THE PAGE WORKS DOUBLE DUTY BOTH REPRESENTING THE POSITION OF THE ACTIONS BEING TAKEN IN TERMS OF THE FLOOR AND ROOM OF THE BUILDING AND REPRESENTING THE PASSAGE OF TIME BUT THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS SINCE THE ACTION JUMPS FROM PAST TO FUTURE AND BACK AGAIN MULTIPLE TIMES HENCE I THINK THIS COMIC REALLY SHOWS HOW COMPLICATED THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SPACE AND TIME IN COMICS IS

U BRANDO ALSO WROTE

ALSO I WANTED TO ASK IF IT IS NORMAL TO GET A GRADUATE DEGREE IN MATHEMATICS AND THEN MOVE OVER TO THE FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS I KNOW A LOT OF MATHEMATICIANS HAVE DONE THIS

I DON T KNOW THAT IT S NORMAL BUT MANY PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PHILOSOPHERS OF MATHEMATICS DURING THE LAST YEARS OR SO FREGE RUSSELL HILBERT THE LIST GOES ON WERE ACTUALLY TRAINED AS MATHEMATICIANS BUT AS A MATTER OF PRACTICALITY IN TERMS OF HOW THE PROFESSION WORKS I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO GET A JOB IN A PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT WITHOUT SOME SORT OF PHILOSOPHY DEGREE ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES IN EUROPE OR ASIA FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE PROGRAMS SPECIALIZING IN LOGIC THAT HIRE PEOPLE WITH DEGREES IN MATHEMATICS OCCASIONALLY OF COURSE ONE DOESN T NEED A JOB IN A PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT TO DO OR PUBLISH PHILOSOPHY SO YOU SHOULDN T LET THESE FACTS STOP YOU IN THAT SENSE

U WROTE
OVER THIS PAST YEAR I VE DEVELOPED AN OUTLINE FOR A TRUTH THEORY IN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE SHED LIGHT ON THESE PARADOXES HERE IS A VERY BRIEF SUMMARY SUMMARY OMITTED SO FOR MY QUESTION WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY OTHER ATTEMPTS OF THIS KIND OR KNOW OF ANY GOOD RESOURCES TO LOOK INTO FOR OTHER WORK ON THIS APPROACH THANKS FOR ANY FEEDBACK

I M NOT SURE I VE SEEN ANYTHING WITH THESE EXACT DETAILS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE LOTS OF VIEWS THAT EXAMINE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SENTENCE AND PROPOSITIONS AND LOTS OF VIEWS THAT INVOLVING RESTRICTING TRUTH TO GROUNDEDNESS OR WELL-FOUNDEDNESS IN SOME WAY KRIPKE S CLASSIC PAPER IS OF COURSE THE STARTING POINT MY FIRST PIECE OF ADVICE WOULD BE TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR VIEW MIGHT HANDLE A REVENGE LIARS LIKE

THE SUBJECT OF THIS SENTENCE FAILS TO HAVE THE PROPERTY ATTRIBUTED TO IT BY THIS SENTENCE BECAUSE OF GROUNDEDNESS ISSUES

U MIRACLEOFSCIENCE WROTE

FOR MY GRADUATE THESIS I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS MATHEMATICS AS AN AESTETHIC OBJECT AS DESCRIBED BY FREDERICK SCHILLER NAMELY MATHEMATICS HAS BOTH COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL SENSUAL ASPECTS DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR RECOMMENDED READINGS ON HOW MATHEMATICS IS GROUNDED IN OUR PHYSICAL SENSUOUS EXISTENCE

THE AESTHETICS OF MATHEMATICS IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SUBJECT AND I THINK MOST OF THE WORK OUT THERE ON THE TOPIC FALLS SHORT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE JOURNAL PHILOSOPHIC MATHEMATIC MIGHT HAVE SOME GOOD ARTICLES ON THE TOPIC COMING OUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THOSE

WHY ARE INCOMPLETENESS THEOREMS SUCH A BIG DEAL FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THEY ONLY PROVIDE VERY SPECIFIC CONTRIVED EXAMPLES OF UNPROVABLE TRUE STATEMENTS YET PEOPLE SAY THEY CHANGED EVERYTHING
WOW SUCH AN INTERESTING LIFE VERY IMPRESSED BY ALL OF IT I WOULD ASK ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED UNTIL NOW BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL GET EASILY CONFUSED BY IT

SO MY QUESTION IS IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS OR LEGO OR THE COMICS WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'D BE OR WANT TO BE

I WISH I HAD BETTER QUESTIONS HONESTLY BUT I'M NOT A MAN OF PHILOSOPHY NOR ASKING DECENT QUESTIONS YET BUT THANK YOU NONETHELESS
I'M FASCINATED BY THE LINE AT WHICH ACCEPTED STANDARD MODELS OF PHYSICS CROSS OVER INTO THEORETICAL AND IMO PHILOSOPHICAL TERRITORY DOES PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY REGARDING MODELS SUCH AS M THEORY AND LOOP QUANTUM GRAVITY WHAT ABOUT EVEN MORE FRINGE MODELS SUCH AS ROGER CONFORMAL CYCLIC COSMOLOGY
HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS

WE HAVE MANY SIMILAR INTERESTS BUT I WAS HOPING YOU COULD EXPAND A BIT ABOUT HOW WHY YOU TRY TO REDUCE ALL OF MATH BUT GEOMETRY TO LOGICAL TERMS I ALWAYS FOUND GEOMETRY MOSTLY EUCLIDIAN TO BE WHAT I VISUALIZED WHEN I TOOK LOGIC CLASSES OR EVEN WHEN I APPLIED LOGIC TO MORAL PHILOSOPHY

JUST A VERY VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE BUT I VISUAL MODUS POLLENS AND MODUS PONES IN TERMS OF AND PLEASE FORGIVE THIS ATROCIOUS DESCRIPTION BUT I'M ON MOBILE AND CAN'T JUST DRAW IT TWO INTERSECTING LINES WHERE ANGLE X ANGLE Y SO IT'S THE SAME WAY WHERE BASICALLY ONE QUADRANT IS X THEN THE NEXT Y THEN THE OPPOSITE ANGLE IS X AND THE LAST Y AGAIN

I'M NOT EXPLAINING IT VERY WELL BUT I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOU OMIT GEOMETRY IN YOUR REDUCTIONISM

I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT IF YOU HAD THE TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO READING SOME OF YOUR WORK

THANK YOU AGAIN
HI ROY GREAT TO SEE YOU HERE I RECENTLY CAUGHT YOUR TALK ON DISTINCTIONS VERY INTERESTING STUFF IF I RECALL CORRECTLY TO GET YOUR ARGUMENT OFF THE GROUND YOU NEED TO ASSUME THAT DISTINCTIONS ARE OBJECTS AND YOU DEFENDED THIS BY POINTING OUT THAT WE CAN COUNT THEM BUT IT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR THAT COUNTING IS SUFFICIENT FOR IS IT FOR INSTANCE I CAN COUNT SAKES THE SAKE FOR WHICH I DID X IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT FOR WHICH YOU DID X SO THERE ARE TWO SAKES FOR WHICH PEOPLE DID X BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK THAT SAKES ARE OBJECTS SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN SAY A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT THANKS
IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES IS IT USEFUL TO HAVE A FORMAL DEFINITION OF COMICS A SET OF RULES WITH WHICH ONE CAN SAY THIS IS COMICS THIS IS NOT AND IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES IS IT USEFUL FOR THOSE BOUNDARIES TO BE SQUISHY BATMAN IS PRETTY MUCH COMICS THE BATEAUX TAPESTRY IS KIND OF VAGUELY COMICS THIS SERIES OF AIRBRUSHED PHOTOGRAPHS IS ALMOST ENTIRELY NOT COMICS
WHO DOES BETTER ALAN MOORE OR GRANT MORRISON

AND DID YOU READ MULTIVERSITY IF SO WHAT DID YOU THINK
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON SEEMINGLY PARADOXICAL PROBABILITY STATEMENTS I'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH THE QUESTION OF IF I WERE TO CHOOSE ANY NUMBER SAY WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT MY NUMBER WOULD BE CHOSEN AT RANDOM IF THE SET OF NUMBERS WERE ALL NUMBERS IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THERE HAS TO BE AT LEAST CHANCE THAT COULD BE CHOSEN BUT FROM WHAT I HEAR PROBABILITY STATES THAT THE CHANCE IS I COULD UNDERSTAND IF THE NUMBER IS VERY CLOSE TO BUT NOT ZERO THERE HAS TO BE A CHANCE

I ALSO DON'T KNOW IF THE TERMINOLOGY I USED HERE IS ACCURATE IN THAT ALL NUMBERS VS REAL NUMBERS VS NATURAL NUMBERS BUT BASICALLY I THINK IT SHOULD BE THE SAME THING
BEEP I'M APPLYING TO MINNESOTA'S PHD PROGRAM THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AMA

HOW WAS THE MOVE FROM PHIL OF MATH AND LOGIC TO PHIL OF POP ART FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BEING IN THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY BY THIS I MEAN PHIL OF MATH AND LOGIC ARE MORE ACCEPTED AS CORE PHILOSOPHY BUT PHIL OF POP ART ESPECIALLY COMICS WHICH ARE OFTEN DEEMED TO BE JUVENILE AND NOT LITERATURE IS DEFINITELY NOT PART OF CORE PHILOSOPHY DO SOME PHILOSOPHERS NOW SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT DOING PHILOSOPHY

WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN COMICS AND GRAPHIC NOVELS ANY INTEREST IN LOOKING AT MANGA

WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT GARFIELD

ALSO DC OR MARVEL
HEY ROY CAN YOU PUT AND END TO SOLIPSISM FOR ME THE IDEA OF IT REALLY SCREWS WITH ME AND IT ABSOLUTELY SUCKS
HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED THE I THINK IT'S MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING RESPONSE WHEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN ISSUES LIKE THE LIAR PARADOX OR FREGE AND RUSSELL ON DEFINITE DESCRIPTIONS HOW DO YOU HANDLE THOSE I'M MORE INTERESTED IN YOUR ENCOUNTERS WITH THIS SORT OF THING OUTSIDE THIS CLASSROOM
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM DOES IT AMAZE YOU LIKE CANTOR'S THEOREM DID OR DO YOU THINK MATH WOULD BE BETTER WITHOUT IT
HI PROFESSOR COOK

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS PASSAGE FROM PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS

IT PHILOSOPHY ALSO LEAVES MATHEMATICS AS IT IS AND NO MATHEMATICAL DISCOVERY CAN ADVANCE IT A LEADING PROBLEM OF MATHEMATICAL LOGIC IS FOR US A PROBLEM OF MATHEMATICS LIKE ANY OTHER


BY THE WAY I'LL BE HERE UNTIL EASTERN TIME AND THEN I MIGHT FIND TIME TO CHECK IN AGAIN LATER THIS EVENING
CAN YOU ELI THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PABLO PARADOX I'VE BEEN READING YOUR TEXT ON IT AND IT'S A BIT CONFUSING

ALSO AS A ASPIRING GRADUATE RESEARCHER IN LOGIC WHAT ARE SOME TEXTS THAT YOU THINK WOULD HELP ME LEARN ABOUT CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH TOPICS
BEFORE ASKING MY QUESTION JUST LET ME SAY THAT I'M GLAD TO SEE RESPECT FOR PEANUTS AMONG PHILOSOPHERS I HAD ACCESS TO THOSE OLD ONES WHEN QUITE YOUNG AND THEY REALLY ARE QUITE A LOT MORE INTERESTING THAN WHATEVER BECAME OF THE PEANUTS MULTIMEDIA FRANCHISE AND MERCHANDISE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX RECENTLY WHILE READING SCHOPENHAUER I JUST HAD TO DO MY OWN FAN PARODY AS WELL BUT I DIGRESS

I'VE NOTICED THAT COMICS CAN AROUSE GREAT EVEN DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF ANGER OUTRAGE AND OFFENSE DESPITE THE QUITE TYPICAL NEGLECT SHOWN TOWARDS OUTSIDE OF FANDOMS A CONVENTIONAL EXAMPLE WOULD BE AND CHARLIE HEBO CARTOONS BUT THERE ARE LOADS BESIDES ONES THAT TARGET SOME RELIGION ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THIS FINNISH ANTI-SOVIET EDITORIAL CARTOON THAT PROMPTED A DIPLOMATIC APOLOGY SPINE KILLING ANATOMY OF COMIC BOOK WOMEN THE EVANGELICAL GOSPEL TRACTS OF JACK CHICK THAT ARE OFTEN ANTI-CATHOLIC HOMOPHOBIC AND CREATIONIST S COMIC BOOK CONTROVERSY AND THE CODE THAT WAS INTRODUCED AS A RESPONSE TO IT TINTIN IN CONGO AND RACISM AND SO ON

THIS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED MERE CHERRY PICKING BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE MIGHT SOMETHING MORE INVOLVED HERE THERE IS A SEEMING DISCONNECT BETWEEN HOW SERIOUSLY COMICS ARE TAKEN AND HOW SERIOUS CONTROVERSY THEY SEEM TO CAUSE ARE THERE PERHAPS SOME FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMICS THAT ENCOURAGE THIS IN YOUR VIEW ONE LINE REASONING I'VE READ MENTIONS THAT UNLIKE IN LITERATURE IN COMICS ABSTRACT DESCRIPTIONS NEED TO BE CONCRETIZED AND THIS LETS WHATEVER PREJUDICED BIASES THE ARTIST TO BE MORE VISIBLE AND UNLIKE IN LIVE ACTION FILMS THE ARTIST RETAINS A HIGHER LEVEL CONTROL WHICH IS WHY SPIRIT APPEARS MORE RACIST TO CONTEMPORARY VIEWER THAN MANY THEN CONTEMPORANEOUS LIVE ACTION FILMS
I AM ALSO A PHILOSOPHY PHD AND A BIG COMIC FAN WE APPEAR TO SHARE A WELL-JUSTIFIED LOVE OF GRANT MORRISON SO WHAT DID YOU THINK OF SUPEREGOS SPECIFICALLY THE GOOD PARTS ABOUT COMIC BOOKS AND LESS SO THE WEIRD PARTS ABOUT HALLUCINOGENIC NEPALESE ALIENS
OK SO SAY THERE'S THIS TROLLEY HEADING DOWN THE TRACKS IT THEN SPLITS OFF INTO TWO DIRECTIONS WITH A LEVER DIRECTING IT ON ONE SIDE THERE ARE THREE PPL TIED DOWN THE OTHER ONLY ONE PERSON IF YOU DO NOTHING THE THREE PEOPLE WILL DIE YOU CAN PULL THE LEVER TO REDIRECT AND KILL ONLY THE ONE PERSON WHAT DO YOU DO
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF A PHOTOGRAPH THAT CAPTURES A HUMAN BEING IN IT'S FRAME TO YOU

DO YOU THINK IT HAS VALUE BECAUSE OF THE FLEETING MOMENT CAPTURED OF SOMEONE OR PERHAPS YOUR OWN LIFE

DO YOU BELIEVE THE CONTRARY

NOT TOTALLY SURE IF THIS IS A PROPER QUESTION FOR YOU BUT I'M CURIOUS
I GOT AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN HISTORY AND ACCIDENTALLY GOT ONE IN LIBERAL STUDIES AS WELL I THINK I GOT IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE PHILOSOPHY CLASSES I TOOK I ENJOYED PHILOSOPHY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN MY LIFE I WANT TO CONTINUE WITH STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I CANNOT GO BACK TO COLLEGE

HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT A NON STUDENT GET IMMERSED IN PHILOSOPHY
HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE OPINIONS MADE BY MANY FAMOUS SCIENTISTS LIKE TYSON AND HAWKING THAT PHILOSOPHY IS USELESS
WHAT GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION DOES A NUMBER CARRY
IS INFINITY LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
HEY MAN ANY ADVICE FOR A GUY WRITING HIS PHD PROPOSAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS HAHA THIS IS PROVING DIFFICULT TO GET INTO FOR SOME REASON


ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH JEFFERY RIPAL AND MUTANTS AND MYSTICS I TOOK A PHILOSOPHY CLASS IN COLLEGE ON COMICBOOKS I AM GLAD TO SEE OTHER PROFESSORS DOING THE SAME
WHAT HAPPENED WITH EGOS THEY USED TO BE SIMPLE OH COME ON I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I M TALKING ABOUT EGOS WERE SIMPLE SOMETHING HAPPENED OUT HERE WHILE I WAS INSIDE HARRY POTTER EGOS STAR WARS EGOS COMPLICATED KITS TINY LITTLE BLOCKS I MEAN I M NOT SAYING ITS BAD I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
HEY ROY

DO YOU HAVE ANY BOOK WEBSITE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CRITICAL THINKING NOT TRYING TO BECOME A PHILOSOPHER JUST TRYING TO BETTER MYSELF IN DAY TO DAY LIFE
HI THERE
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M TOO LATE FOR THIS THREAD
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW MATHEMATICS MIGHT BE REPRESENTED IN THE BRAIN
THANKS FOR YOUR HARD WORK
HELLO THANKS FOR DOING THE AMA I AM A MATH UNDERGRADUATE INTERESTING IN PHILOSOPHY IN LOGIC I AM VERY EXCITED FOR YOU TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS

GIVEN THAT WE CAN THINK OF TRUTH AS A FUNCTION THAT MAPS STATEMENTS INTO AND MAYBE A 2 FOR NONSENSICAL OR MAYBE WE JUST CAN'T EXTEND THIS FUNCTION TO THE ENTIRE SET OF STATEMENTS HENCE WORKING IN SYSTEMS FREE OF CONTRADICTION ETC WHAT WORK HAS THERE BEEN TO THINK WHAT OTHER SETS WE CAN MAP STATEMENTS INTO HOW WOULD LOGIC LOOK LIKE IF SAY WE HAD A MORE CONTINUOUS SET SUCH AS R AND TRIED TO MAP IN A NONTRIVIAL WAY MEANING WE DON'T JUST MAP TO SUBSET OF R BUT IN A SENSE SUBJECTIVELY

THAT IS MY MAIN QUESTION BUT I HAVE SOME OTHER LINGERING THOUGHTS AS WELL WHICH MAY OVERLAP WHAT WOULD LOGIC LOOK LIKE WITHOUT THE LAW OF EXCLUDED MIDDLE CAN WE MAKE LOGIC LOOK MORE LIKE A TOPOLOGY RATHER THAN A GEOMETRY
ROY ON THE ONE HAND WE ARE LEAD TO BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSE CAME TO BE FROM NOTHING AND ON THE OTHER THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD NO BEGINNING AREN'T BOTH PARADOXES

HOW COULD SOMETHING COME TO BE OUT OF NOTHING AND
2 HOW COULD SOMETHING EXIST WITH NO BEGINNING
HEY ROY I'M TRANSFERRING TO THE U NEXT FALL I'LL DEFINITELY TRY TO GET INTO YOUR CLASS
AS SOMEONE TAKING A MATHEMATICAL LOGIC CLASS IN A MATH DEPARTMENT WHAT MAJOR ASPECTS IN THE FIELD DO YOU THINK I'M MISSING THE FIRST QUARTER IS MODEL THEORY AND ULTRAFILTER THE SECOND QUARTER PROVES THE INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM AND INTRODUCES NOTIONS OF COMPUTABILITY
WHATS YOUR TAKE ON DIALETHEISM
HELLO SIR

I'M NOT SURE IF I'M TOO LATE IN BERTRAND THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY HE WRITES HENCE EITHER THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE THING IN THE UNIVERSE OR IF THERE ARE MANY THINGS THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY INTERACT IN ANY WAY SINCE ANY INTERACTION WOULD BE A RELATION AND RELATIONS ARE IMPOSSIBLE

I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF THIS BINARY I UNDERSTAND WHY BERTRAND RUSSELL IS SAYING THIS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY RESPONSES BY OTHER FAMOUS THINKERS TO THIS SITUATION I'M FAMILIAR WITH HUME CRITICISMS OF INDUCTIVE REASONING AND SOME OTHER THINKERS
WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST RESERVATION AGAINST KRIPKEAN ESSENTIALISM THANKS PROFESSOR
TO BE OR NOT TO BE
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WORK SPECIFICALLY GDEL ESCHER BACH DID YOU EVER BUMP INTO IT DURING YOUR PARADOX PHASE
I ASSUME THAT YOU FIND A LACK OF LOGICAL THOUGHT IN YOURSELF AND IN OTHER PEOPLE QUITE OFTEN PARTICULARLY IN POLITICS HOW DO YOU COME TO TERMS WITH THIS AND HOW DO YOU PITCH YOUR IDEAS AND OPINIONS TO PEOPLE WHO BY DEFINITION CANNOT FOLLOW A LOGICAL TRAIN OF THOUGHT
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH CAT IF SO GIVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THE EXPERIMENT
CONTRARY TO MEDIA PORTRAYALS WHICH ARE LARGELY PROPAGANDA MACHINES ANYWAY SCIENCE FALLS SQUARELY ON THE SIDE OF REDUCING ANIMAL PRODUCT CONSUMPTION FOR HEALTH REASONS ANYWAY
THE ARGUMENTS FOR VEGANISM ARE COMPELLING PARTICULARLY THE ETHICAL ONES BUT THERE ARE GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH REASONS TO GO VEGAN AS WELL
















EAT WHAT YOU WANT JUST DON'T STOP ME EATING WHAT I WANT
METHANE FROM COWS IS NUTS BIG TIME I THINK AS A SPECIES WE SHOULD AIM TO HAVE RED MEAT MAX ONCE A MONTH AS IM PRETTY SURE THATS WHAT IS RECOMMENDED FOR A HEALTHY DIET BUT FUCK STEAK IS SO GOOD I WAS RAISED IN CALGARY AB WE HAD THAT SHIT AT LEAST TWO TIMES A WEEK ITS A HARD CONVERSATION PEOPLE LOVE MEAT VERY EFFECTIVE PROTEIN SOURCE
EMPATHY ORIGINALLY FOR USE LEAKS INTO OTHER MAMMALS THAT HAVE HUMAN LIKE QUALITIES MAKING PEOPLE PROJECT THEIR OWN SENSE OF WELL-BEING ONTO ANIMALS LIKE COWS PIGS ETC

THE EMPATHY LEAKAGE DOES NOT TRICKLE DOWN TO INSECTS ETC THAT DO NOT SHARE RECOGNISABLE HUMAN QUALITIES BECAUSE OUR SENSORY INDICATORS DO NOT RECOGNISE THEM AS HUMAN LIKE AND WORTHY OF EMPATHY ULTIMATELY EMPATHY FOR ANIMALS IS EVOLUTIONARILY AND LEADS TO REDUCTIONS IN EFFICIENCY CONCERNING NEEDLESS OPPOSITION TO THE INDUSTRIALISATION OF MEAT CONSUMPTION
ESSENTIALLY ALL ALTRUISTIC ACTS ARE AN INTERNAL TRANSACTION YOU EXCHANGE SOME TIME OR RESOURCES TO BE INTERNALLY REWARDED WITH A WARM GLOW DUE TO THE EMPATHY EFFECT HUMANS WILL BE REWARDED WITH UTILITY WHEN THEY HELP OTHERS AS LONG AS AN INDIVIDUAL VALUES THAT WARM GLOW OF PERSONAL UTILITY MORE THAN THE RESOURCE THEY ARE TRADING FOR IT DONATING THAT IS A RATIONAL ACT COMPATIBLE WITH OBJECTIVISM

I BELIEVE EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM IS THE ABILITY TO DELAY GRATIFICATION INSTEAD OF BEING A UTILITY DRUG ADDICT LOL AND GOING FOR THE EASY HIT OF WARM GLOW I WILL DELAY THIS GRATIFICATION AND I WILL END UP DOING MORE FOR THE RECIPIENT OF MY GENEROSITY IT JUST WON'T BE AS VISCERAL AND STIMULATING TO ME RIGHT NOW

FOR INSTANCE TEACHING SOMEONE TO FISH AS OPPOSED TO JUST GIVING THEM A FISH
EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM IS ABOUT HOW TO OPTIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF GOOD YOU GENERATE WITH YOUR ACTIONS IN THIS CONTEXT IT CRITICIZES CERTAIN KINDS OF ALTRUISTIC PRACTICES THE GOODNESS OF HEART KIND THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD THEY ARE ACTUALLY NOT VERY EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING PEOPLE'S LIVES EFFECTIVE ALTRUISTS TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT IMPROVING OTHER PEOPLES LIVES IS AN INTRINSIC GOOD

AYN RAND CRITICIZES ELEVATING ALTRUISM TO A HIGHER MORAL GROUND THAN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND USING THIS IDEA TO JUSTIFY STEALING FROM OR ENSLAVING THE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY OTHER THAN THAT THERE IS NO OBJECTION FOR VOLUNTARY ALTRUISM SINCE THE INDIVIDUAL IS FREE TO DO AS HE WISHES WITH HIS OWN RESOURCES

THE SIB MAKES HER PREDICTION PRIOR TO YOU LEARNING ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT THAT'S RELEVANT BECAUSE THAT MEANS WE DON'T HAVE AN ENDLESS FEEDBACK LOOP HERE THE SIB MUST DECIDE IN ADVANCE IF YOU ARE A BOTH PERSON OR A B PERSON AT FIRST GLANCE EITHER CHOICE YOU MAKE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE BECAUSE THE BEING IS NOT PREDICTING THE FUTURE IN A VACUUM SHE'S ASSESSING WHAT TYPE OF PERSON ARE YOU ARE YOU A BOTH PERSON OR A B PERSON IF YOU'RE A BOTH PERSON YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF CHOOSING BOTH AND IF YOU'RE A B PERSON YOU'LL BE BETTER OF TAKING B HOWEVER SINCE IT'S BETTER IN THIS GAME TO BE A B PERSON I WOULD BE A B PERSON AUX FOR ALL YOU BOTH PEOPLE
EEM IF YOUR PRESENT DECISION DOESN'T ALTER YOUR PAST DECISION I'M PRETTY SURE THE SIB PREDICTED THAT YOU WOULD CHANGE YOUR PAST DECISION INTO YOUR PRESENT DECISION THE FACT THAT YOU CHANGED FROM ONLY B TO BOTH WAS SOMETHING HE ACCOUNTED FOR MAKING THE FINAL PAYOFF INSTEAD OF

THIS OF COURSE ASSUMING SAID SIB IS ALWAYS RIGHT WHICH IS THE CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF THIS PROBLEM
PARADOX IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO NORMALLY RELIABLE HEURISTICS THAT PEOPLE COMMONLY USE WHICH GIVE OPPOSITE ANSWERS THE HEURISTIC THAT YOU'RE MOST COMFORTABLE USING DETERMINES WHETHER YOU'RE A OR A

TAKING BOTH BOXES IS THE STRICTLY DOMINANT STRATEGY THE CONTENTS OF THE BOXES ARE SET AND CAN'T CHANGE SO REGARDLESS OF THE CONTENT OF BOX B YOU WILL EARN MORE MONEY BY TAKING BOTH BOXES MOST OF THE INFORMATION IN THE PROBLEM IS IRRELEVANT DUE TO THAT FACT IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO TAKE ONLY ONE BOX

TAKING ONLY BOX B PROVIDES SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPECTED VALUE ACCORDING TO THE CONDITIONS SET IN THE PROBLEM THE EXPECTED VALUE FOR TAKING ONLY ONE BOX IS HIGHER THAN TAKING BOTH WITH ZERO OR DEPENDING ON HOW YOU INTERPRET IT VARIANCE IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO TAKE BOTH BOXES

BOTH OF THESE HEURISTICS ARE EXTREMELY POWERFUL IN ALMOST ALL CASES AND OFTEN CAN CONSTITUTE A PROOF OF THE BEST MOVE IN PARADOX THEY DISAGREE WHICH IS BIZARRE AND PERPLEXING IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS PARADOX HAS AN EASY ANSWER TRY TO EXPLAIN HOW THE METHOD YOU'RE NOT USING IS WRONG BEFORE PUTTING IT TO REST
ITT PROBLEM IS LIVING UP TO IT'S PEOPLE ARE REALLY SURE OF THEIR CHOICE REPUTATION

I'D TAKE ONLY B THE PRIOR ON THE BEING BEING CORRECT IS REALLY GOOD AND THAT'S HARD TO IGNORE I'D RISK FOR A REALLY GOOD SHOT AT WINNING
HERE'S A VERY USEFUL PRINCIPLE FOR UNDERSTANDING THIS KIND OF CONUNDRUM WHEN YOU ARE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME DETERMINING THE ANSWER YOU ARE PROBABLY ASKING THE WRONG QUESTION

IN SOLUTION WE TAKE BOX B BECAUSE WE ACCEPT AS TRUE THE PREMISE THAT THE AI IS INFALLIBLE IN SOLUTION 2 WE TAKE TWO BOXES AND IN DOING SO REJECT THAT PREMISE I EAST ASSUME IT IS FALSE THE REASON PEOPLE SPLIT INTO TWO GROUPS IS BECAUSE EACH OF THEM IS CONSIDERING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT QUESTION THE REASON IT IS SO CONTENTIOUS IS THAT EACH SOLUTION IS LOGICALLY CORRECT GIVEN ITS INTERPRETATION OF THE QUESTION

THE QUESTION ITSELF NEVER SPECIFIES THAT THE AI IS INFALLIBLE MERELY THAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO FAR THAT IS A RED HERRING BECAUSE ALL THAT MATTERS IS WHETHER THE AI CAN MAKE A MISTAKE IN THE FUTURE YOU HAVE NO INFORMATION TO SETTLE THAT AND DEPENDING WHETHER YOU THINK IT IS SO ONE OR THE OTHER SOLUTION IS CLEARLY CORRECT

THE CORRECT ANSWER IS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY LOGICALLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER ONE OF THE PREMISES IS TRUE OR FALSE

TL R THE QUESTION IS AMBIGUOUS AND DEPENDING HOW YOU INTERPRET IT ONE OR THE OTHER SOLUTION IS ENTIRELY LOGICAL
TO ME THERE IS VERY LITTLE TO THINK ABOUT HERE THE WAY THIS IS PUT OUT IT SEEMS YOU CAN NOT TRICK THE ALIEN SO YOU CHOOSE B AND ONLY B EVERYTIME

SAY YOU WALK UP TO THE TABLE UNDECIDED YOU LITERALLY STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU WILL CHOOSE YOU LOOK AT THE BOXES AND THE ALIEN HAS ALREADY PREPARED THEM YOU PULL OUT A COIN FROM YOUR POCKET AND DECIDE TO MAKE YOUR CHOICE BASED ON A FLIPPED COIN JUST TO MAKE IT RANDOM THE COIN LANDS AND CHOOSES FOR YOU IN A TURN OF EVENTS YOU DECIDE TO GO AGAINST THE COIN YOU KNOW JUST TO TRICK THE ALIEN FURTHER BUT WAIT SINCE THE BOXES HAVE ALREADY BEEN PLACED AND SINCE WHATEVER IS IN THEM CAN'T BE CHANGED YOU JUST NOW GET THE IDEA THAT YOU MIGHT ASWELL JUST TAKE BOTH BECAUSE ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE DUMB AT THIS POINT RIGHT YOU BATTLE WITH YOUR MIND FOR A MOMENT BUT DECIDE THAT OF COURSE YOU SHOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE ILLOGICAL AT THIS POINT SO YOU DO YOU OPEN THE BOXES AND YOU ARE FILLED WITH DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE THE ALIEN KNEW ALL ALONG BECAUSE IT KNEW THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE APPARENTLY IT KNEW THAT YOU WOULD THROW A COIN IT KNEW THE OUTCOME OF THE COIN IT KNEW THAT YOU WOULD GO AGAINST IT IT ALSO KNEW THAT IN THAT MOMENT AN IDEA WOULD POP IN TO YOUR HEAD AND WHAT THE OUTCOME OF YOU MINDBATTLE WOULD BE IT KNEW EVERYTHING YOU CAN'T ESCAPE THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND YOU CAN'T ESCAPE WHAT YOU'RE DETERMINED TO DO IN A GIVEN SITUATION HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS PREDICTABLE THE SAME WAY A FALLING ROCK IS YOUR MIND IS NOT RANDOM AND SO THE ALIEN ALWAYS KNOWS B AND ONLY B EVERYTIME

I TAKE BOTH BOXES OF COURSE THE EXPLANATION MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I CHOOSE BECAUSE THE AI HAS ALREADY MADE ITS PREDICTION AND MY CHOICE ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE IT MY CHOICE IS JUST AN ILLUSION AT THIS POINT THE BOXES ALREADY HAVE CONTENT IN THEM SO I LOSE NOTHING BY TAKING BOTH BUT I POTENTIALLY LOSE A LOT BY TRYING TO SOMEHOW CHANGE THE PAST BY MAKING A DIFFERENT CHOICE
THIS IS A SILLY SITUATION CLEARLY THE AI CAN'T GET HER PREDICTION WRONG WHICH MEANS IT'S TAKEN THE DECISION-MAKING AWAY FROM US BOTH CHOICES WOULD HAVE BEEN PREDICTED BY HER WHICH MEANS WE ARE ACTUALLY CHOOSING BETWEEN BOTH THE CONSEQUENCES

CHOOSE BOTH BOXES AND THE AI WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT ERGO YOU ONLY GET

CHOOSE BOX B AND THE AI WOULD HAVE GUESSED IT ERGO YOU GET THE MILLION

THERE'S NO CONUNDRUM
I SWEAR IF I FIND ANY GOAT IN THAT BOX I'M GONNA EXPLODE

MORE SERIOUSLY I THINK THIS IS A MATTER OF CONFIDENCE IN THE IA DECISION IF YOU TRUST IT ACTUALLY DELIVERS YOU TAKE BOX B IF NOT YOU TAKE BOTH

AS A DEVELOPER I TOOK ONLY BOX B BUT I CAN PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES

EDIT A FRIEND SOLUTION IS TAKING ONLY BOX B LOOKING INTO IT AND CUEING THE IA FOR SCAMMING IF IT'S EMPTY
THE RIGHT COURSE IS TO CHOOSE ONLY BOX B BUT BEFORE YOU CHOOSE IT YOU FIND A BETTING ESTABLISHMENT THAT WILL GIVE YOU ODDS ON THE THE AI BEING WRONG AND PLACE A BET THAT THE AI WILL HAVE GUESSED YOU WILL TAKE BOTH BOXES AND SO HAVE PLACED NO MONEY IN BOX B

WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE AI WILL PREDICT YOUR CHOICE ACCURATELY AS IT SEEMS TO HAVE PREDICTED MANY HARD TO PREDICT OUTCOMES IN THE PAST BUT IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE STILL REGARD THE POSSIBILITY OF THE AI BEING WRONG AS A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT IS THAT YOU COULD TAKE BOTH BOXES AND STILL WIND UP WITH THE MILLION IN BOX B SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND SOME BETTING ESTABLISHMENT THAT WILL GIVE YOU ODDS AS SOME PEOPLE WILL SURELY BELIEVE THAT THE AI COULD NOT GUESS OUT OF CHOICES CORRECTLY

SO THEN WHEN YOU TAKE BOX B ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN

BOX B WILL HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS IN IT AND SO ONCE YOU PAY YOUR WAGER TO THE BOOKIE YOU WILL HAVE A NET IN WINNINGS OR

2 BOX B WILL HAVE NOTHING IN IT AND YOUR BET WILL HAVE PAID OFF GIVING YOU A NET IN WINNINGS

THIS WAY THAT IS NO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT YOUR OUTCOME AND EVEN IF SOMEONE GAMBLES ON TAKING BOTH BOXES AND HAPPENS TO WIN AGAINST THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE AI THAT IS VERY GOOD AT PREDICTING SUCH OUTCOMES THEY ARE STILL ONLY RICHER THAN YOU THE PERSON WHO ASSURED THEIR SUCCESS A SUM THAT IS BASICALLY A ROUNDING ERROR WHEN YOU ARE SPEAKING ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS
SEE HOW THE BOURGEOIS ORDER TRICKS YOU INTO PICKING EITHER BOX WHEN IN FACT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IS THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION
LOOKS TO ME LIKE A DISGUISED FREE WILL DEBATE SINCE AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS A BEING ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE IT'S OBSOLETE
IT SEEMS LIKE MOST DISAGREEMENT COMES FROM WHETHER THE BEING IS TREATED AS INFALLIBLE OR NOT
THE ARTICLE MENTIONED THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH BOX IS WHICH IS THERE A RISK OF ONLY WANTING BOX B BUT ACCIDENTALLY GRABBING BOX A INSTEAD I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE ME MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GRAB BOTH
THE CORE OF THE CONUNDRUM IN THIS PROBLEM IS RETROCAUSALITY THINGS HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE CHANGING EVENTS IN THE PAST

EDMONDS WRITES

YOU CANNOT INFLUENCE A DECISION MADE IN THE PAST BY A DECISION MADE IN THE PRESENT

BUT THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS DOING WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE BEING BEING ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT YOU WILL CHOOSE YOUR DECISION IN THE PRESENT CHOOSING A BOX INFLUENCES WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST THE BEING DECIDING WHAT TO PUT IN BOX B OF COURSE THE PROBLEM AS STATED HEDGES THIS A BIT BY COMING JUST SHORT OF SAYING THE BEING IS INFALLIBLE

BUT REALLY WHICH SIDE OF THE DEBATE YOU COME DOWN ON DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU DECIDE TO BREAK THIS FEEDBACK LOOP OF RETROCAUSALITY
VERY SIMPLE IF THE SIB IS ALWAYS CORRECT CHOOSING BOTH WILL GET YOU AND CHOOSING B WILL GET YOU AND THE SIB IS ALWAYS CORRECT PERIOD
DR DAVID EDMONDS ARGUMENT ONLY MAKES SENSE IF THE PAST IS INDEPENDENT OF THE PRESENT HOWEVER ONCE YOU ACCEPT THAT THERE IS A BEING THAT CAN MAKE FLAWLESS PREDICTIONS YOU ALREADY IMPLICITLY ACCEPT THAT THE PAST IS NOT INDEPENDENT OF THE PRESENT
SIMPLE I'M NOT REALLY IN DESPERATE NEED OF

IF I CHOOSE BOX B AND TAKE MY CHANCES ON AND GET NOTHING I COME OFF MILDLY DISAPPOINTED BUT CAN GO ABOUT MY DAY LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED

IF I CHOOSE BOX B AND GET I'LL BE QUITE HAPPY

IF I TAKE BOTH BOXES AND GET I'LL BE QUITE HAPPY ABOUT THAT BUT NOT NECESSARILY MORE HAPPY THAN IF IT HAD JUST BEEN

FINALLY IF I TAKE BOTH BOXES AND ONLY END UP WITH I'D BE DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF AND IN THE SUPER INTELLIGENCE FOR LABELING ME AS ILLOGICALLY GREEDY

SO I TAKE BOX B BECAUSE WOULD MAKE MY LIFE MARGINALLY EASIER FOR A WEEK OR TWO BUT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING
IT COMES DOWN TO

IF YOU TAKE IT WILL HAVE PREDICTED

OR JUST IF YOU TAKE IT WILL HAVE

THAT IS ERRONEOUS IN FACT
ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'D PICK IN THE MOMENT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT I WANT TO PRIOR TO PICKING BE THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO WOULD PICK ONLY BOX SUCH THAT THE ONLY PREDICTION THE ALIEN CAN MAKE IS BOX B ONLY SO I'LL PICK BOX B ONLY FOR SURE

TO WIT IN TERMS OF EXPECTED VALUE OF WINNINGS BOX B IS ALSO THE RIGHT CHOICE LET BE THE PROBABILITY THAT THE ALIEN MAKES A CORRECT PREDICTION AND CONSIDER THE EXPECTED WINNINGS UNDER THE TWO POSSIBLE CHOICES

CHOOSE BOTH P P
CHOOSE JUST B P P

ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE FOR THE VALUES OF THAT MAKE THE FIRST EXPRESSION GREATER THAN THE SECOND SHOWS THAT FOR AV
IN THIS ANALYSIS MUST BE GREATER THAN FOR CHOOSING BOTH BOXES TO HAVE A GREATER EXPECTED VALUE REITERATING THAT IN THIS CONFIGURATION OF THE GAME THE SUPER INTELLIGENCE ONLY HAS TO HAVE A PROBABILITY OF OF CORRECTLY PREDICTING YOUR BEHAVIOUR PUT ANOTHER WAY IT COULD BE UP TO OF THE TIME AND THE POLICY OF PICKING ONLY B WOULD BE THE ONE TO MAXIMIZE YOUR EXPECTED VALUE OF WINNING SO EVEN WITHOUT SUPER INTELLIGENCE CHOOSING ONLY B IS STILL GIVES THE HIGHEST EXPECTED WINNINGS UNLESS YOU ARE MORE THAN SURE YOU CAN OUTSMART THE ALIEN

SO MY POLICY IS CURRENTLY ALWAYS CHOOSE JUST B OF THE TIME

EDIT TL R I WOULD WRITE A COMPUTER PROGRAM TO RANDOMLY CHOOSE FOR ME WITH THE ODDS OF IT PICKING BOTH BOXES BEING FIXED AT WHILE IT PICKS JUST B OF THE TIME

EDIT 2 I MADE A MATH MISTAKE SEE MY REPLY
I THINK THE ISSUE WITH PICKING BOTH BOXES IS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MACHINE THAT IS ABLE TO PREDICT BEHAVIOR TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT IS ALWAYS ACCURATE IMPOSSIBLE AT THE MOMENT MAYBE IT ALWAYS WILL BE

OF COURSE IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THE BOX BY HAVING A FRIEND TELL YOU WHAT'S INSIDE THEN IT COMPLETELY NEGATES THE PURPOSE OF THE EXPERIMENT IT'S NO LONGER ABOUT WHAT THE MACHINE PREDICTED BUT HOW TO BREAK THE EXPERIMENT

ULTIMATELY IN THIS SITUATION IF WE'RE AGREEING THE THE MACHINE PREDICTIONS CANNOT BE WRONG THEN YOU'LL EITHER END UP WITH ONE THOUSAND OR ONE MILLION BUT NOT BOTH BECAUSE IF YOU DO END UP WITH BOTH THEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE MACHINE IS NOT ACCURATE OR THAT IT CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR FREE WILLIAM

THIS IS FOR SURE AN EXPERIMENT MEANT TO TEST FREE WILL IN THE FACE OF ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY
A BEING WOULD HAVE RESEARCHED ME AND DISCOVERED THAT I AM A TERRIBLY PERSON SHE WOULD KNOW THAT I WOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES THEREFORE SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT BOX B EMPTY SO I WOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES TO GET
DID I MISREAD THIS
CHOOSE BOTH BOXES
2 CHOOSE B ONLY

SO IF YOU PICK OPTION YOU GET BOX A AND BOX B WHY CHOOSE JUST B THEN

DID I MISS SOMETHING IS IT IF YOU CHOOSE BOTH THEN B WILL HAVE NOTHING
ONE FACTOR THAT I DON'T SEE IN THE RESPONSES SO FAR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN PLAY MAKES A DIFFERENCE

BECAUSE ON SOME LEVEL FOR ANY PERSON IN THAT SITUATION THE CHOICE YOU MAKE IS A STRANGE GAMBLE IN A WEIRD WAY THE GAMBLE IS THIS IF THE PREDICTOR IS ALWAYS CORRECT CAN I SOMEHOW RETROACTIVELY EFFECT THE OUTCOME BY THE CHOICE I'M ABOUT TO MAKE YOU CAN DEBATE THAT ALL YOU WANT BUT TO SOME DEGREE THE ANSWER COMES DOWN TO THE FALLIBILITY OF THE PREDICTOR IF THE PREDICTOR IS TRULY INFALLIBLE AND CANNOT EVER BE WRONG THEN IT'S A SIMPLE CHOICE BETWEEN AND

BACKING OUT THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION THE REAL ANSWER COMES DOWN TO THIS AM I WILLING TO THROW AWAY A GUARANTEED PAYOUT FOR A LIKELY PAYOUT THE ANSWER TO THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH HOW THOSE NUMBERS COMPARE AND WHAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY TO PEOPLE TO GIVE SOME EXAMPLES IF

BOX A HAD AND BOX B HAD MILLION THE GIVEN SCENARIO I WOULD PROBABLY PICK BOX B ONLY
BOX A HAD AND BOX B HAD I WOULD PROBABLY CHOOSE TO TAKE BOTH BOXES
BOX A HAD AND BOX B HAD I WOULD PROBABLY CHOOSE TO TAKE BOX B ONLY
BOX A HAD MILLION AND BOX B HAD MILLION I WOULD PROBABLY CHOOSE TO TAKE BOTH BOXES

IT MIGHT SEEM IRRATIONAL BUT IT HAS TO DO WITH ASSESSING RISK IN THE CONTEXT OF MY LIFE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GETTING AND IS NOT TERRIBLY SIGNIFICANT SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AND OR MILLION IS SIGNIFICANT TO ME AND IF THROWING AWAY MIGHT MAKE IT EXTREMELY LIKELY THAT I WOULD GET A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY I CAN HANDLE THAT LOSS WITHOUT PROBLEM HOWEVER ONCE YOU PUT MILLION AT STAKE I WOULD BECOME VERY RISK AVERSE ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL FOR ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MILLION AND MILLION IS NOT THAT HUGE EITHER WAY IT'S WAY MORE MONEY THAN I NEED AND IT WOULD ENABLE ME TO DO THINGS I COULDN'T OTHERWISE

SO THAT'S MY POSITION IT'S NOT A LOGIC PROBLEM IT'S A RISK ASSESSMENT PROBLEM IT FUNDAMENTALLY COMES DOWN TO AN ASSESSMENT OF AM I COMFORTABLE GAMBLING X AGAINST A Y PAYOUT ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A BEING IS INFALLIBLE
THIS PROBLEM SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT WAY TO BE DISSATISFIED WITH IN A BOX
BOX B FOR SURE I EITHER GET MILLION OR I GET TO LAUGH AT THIS BEINGS FACE FOR BEING WRONG I VALUE EACH OUTCOME MORE THAN THAT THOUSAND
AFTER HAVING READ THIS THREAD I THINK THE SAFEST BET IS TO SAY I AM A BOX B ONLY PERSON ON THIS PUBLIC FORUM NOW IN THE FUTURE WHEN A SUPREMELY INTELLIGENT BEING IS SET THE TASK OF PREDICTING MY CHOICE IT'LL HAVE A PRETTY EASY TIME DOING SO WHEN IT CHECKS MY REDDIN ACCOUNT HISTORY
OBVIOUSLY THE BEING HAS KNOWLEDGE WE CAN NOT COMPREHEND IF IT IS ALWAYS CORRECT WITH ITS PREDICTION WHATEVER THIS KNOWLEDGE IS THE ONLY THING WE CAN COMPREHEND ABOUT IT IS THAT IT IS UNTIL NOW ACCURATE

FROM THIS KNOWLEDGE WE MUST ASSUME THAT IF WE CHOSE BOTH B WILL BE EMPTY AND IF WE ONLY CHOSE B THERE WILL BE MILLION IN THE BOX EVEN IF WE DO NOT COMPREHEND THE UNDERLYING KNOWLEDGE

THUS WE CHOSE B


SO MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO WORK AROUND THE PROBLEM HERE MAYBE THE SIB ISN'T INFALLIBLE MAYBE THE RULES OF THE UNIVERSE ARE DIFFERENT HERE LET'S REPHRASE THE PROBLEM

JUST ACCEPT THE RULES ANSWER THE QUESTION AND STOP TRYING TO WIGGLE OUT OF IT AT SOME POINT SKEPTICISM BECOMES CONTRARIAN AND COWARDLY
THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF THE HALTING PROBLEM IN NEWCOMB S PROBLEM WHEN THE PREDICTOR IN NEWCOMB S PROBLEM CLAIMS TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE CHOICE YOUR GOING TO MAKE IT IS EFFECTIVELY TANTAMOUNT TO BEING ABLE TO SOLVE THE HALTING PROBLEM
LET'S REMOVE THE CONCEPT OF A SUPREME BEING MAKING THE PREDICTIONS AND ASSUME IT IS A TODDLER TODDLERS CAN'T SEE THE FUTURE DO TIME TRAVEL FORCE YOU TO MAKE A DECISION THEY WISH NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY CRY

THE TODDLER MADE ITS DECISION PRIOR TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE TESTAMENT THIS CAN NOT BE UNDONE AND WILL BE SET

IF THE TODDLER CHOSE BOTH THEN B IS EMPTY IF THE TODDLER CHOSE B THEN B HAS A MILLION IN IT

NOW YOU CAN CHOOSE BOTH OR B NEITHER HAS ANY IMPACT ON WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN BOX B HOWEVER OF THE TIME IT IS BEST TO CHOOSE BOTH AS YOU WILL ALWAYS GET AND ON OCCASION YOU WILL GET A MILLION BUT THAT MILLION IS OUT OF YOUR HANDS

NOW BACK TO THE SUPREME BEING WE DO NOT KNOW IF THEIR PREDICTION IS STATIC THEIR PREDICTION MAY CHANGE BASED ON OUR SELECTION HAVING THE ABILITY TO SEE OR CHANGE THE FUTURE OR SIMPLY WE DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE IN THE MATTER THE SUPREME BEING ALREADY DETERMINED IF YOU'RE A BOTH OR A BOX B PERSON IN THE FORMER YES ALWAYS SELECT BOX B BECAUSE THAT IS THE SELECTION THE BEING WILL HAVE PREDICTED BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU MADE IT IN THE LATTER YOU HAVE NO CHOICE SORRY IF YOU ARE A BOTH TYPE

IF THE BEING CAN NOT CHANGE THEIR PREDICTION AND CAN NOT FORESEE THE FUTURE AND HAS TRULY GIVEN YOU FREE WILL IN THE DECISION SELECT BOTH AS PER THE TODDLER AS YOUR DECISIONS WILL NOT AFFECT THE BOX PREDICTION AND YOU WILL ALWAYS COME OUT AHEAD
THE ANSWER DEPENDS IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE TO CONSIDER IT

IF YOU HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED IT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PREDICTIONS WITH YOUR CURRENT ACTIONS TAKE BOTH

IF YOU HAVE READ ABOUT THIS PREVIOUSLY AS WE ALL HAVE YOU MUST NOW TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS PICK ONLY BOX B I OFFICIALLY DECLARE THAT GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY IF I WERE TO SELECT BOTH BOXES I WOULD DESTROY ALL MY WINNINGS
MAYBE SINCE I KNEW YOU'D KNOW I SPENT ALL DAY THINKING ABOUT THE WRONG WIRE

IT STRIKES ME AS A MATTER OF FAITH EITHER YOU BELIEVE THE SIB IS INFALLIBLE OR NOT I WONDER HOW IF IT WOULD CHANGE SOME PEOPLES DECISION IF YOU EXPLICITLY SAID THE BEING IS GOD AND OMNISCIENT

IT ALSO STRIKES ME THAT THE DECISION WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING IF BOTH AMOUNTS WERE FOR EXAMPLE AND FOR MANY IT'S TOO EASY TO DISMISS THE STAKES NEED TO BE HIGHER
BY SAYING THE SUPREME BEING PREDICTS THAT I WILL MAKE A CERTAIN CHOICE ARE YOU NOT CREATING THE IMPLICATION THAT THE SUPREME BEING COULD BE WRONG IF THE PROBLEM WAS THE SUPREME BEING KNOWS WHAT YOU WILL CHOOSE THAT WOULD MAKE THE CHOICE OF BOX B CORRECT BY SAYING THE SUPREME BEING PREDICTS THEN BOX B IS A RISK

IF I TOOK BOTH BOXES AND THE BEING PREDICTED I WOULD TAKE B THEN I GET ALL THE MONEY IF I TAKE BOTH BOXES AND THE BEING WAS CORRECT I GET IF I CHOOSE BOX B AND THE BEING PREDICTED INCORRECTLY I GET NOTHING THIS MEANS IF I CHOOSE B I HAVE A CHANCE OF NOTHING AND IF I CHOOSE BOTH I HAVE PLUS A CHANGE OF AN EXTRA MILLION I DONT FIND THIS A HARD CHOICE
OF COURSE YOU SHOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES
AT NO POINT IT IS STATED THAT THE SIB IS INFALLIBLE IT HAS JUST MADE GOOD PREDICTIONS IN THE PAST YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BY TAKING BOTH BOXES AND NOTHING TO GAIN BY LEAVING THE OTHER BOX BEHIND
YOU TAKE BOX B YOUR FRIEND BEING ABLE TO SEE WHATS IN THE BOXES IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE HE WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU TO TAKE BOTH BOXES IF HE IS ASKED BUT WHETHER OR NOT HE IS ASKED IS ALSO FACTORED INTO THE BEINGS PREDICTION IE IF YOUR FRIEND COMMUNICATES TO YOU TO TAKE BOTH BOXES AND YOU DO TAKE BOTH THERE IS NOTHING IN BOX B IF HE TELLS YOU TO TAKE BOTH BUT YOU DECIDE TO TAKE BOX B THEN THERE WAS MILLION DOLLARS IN BOX B

IF THE PROBLEM ASSUMES THAT THE BEINGS PREDICTION IS AS GOOD AS FACT THEN YOU TAKE BOX B IT'S NO MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
IN THE END I PICK B BECAUSE I WOULDN'T REALLY MIND NOT GETTING AN EXTRA BUT NOT GETTING WOULD REALLY FUCK WITH MY HEAD IF I PICKED BOTH BOXES
OFCOURSE YOU TAKE ONLY B IF THE ALIEN PREDICTED THAT GREAT YOU GOT IF NOT WELL ATLEAST YOU MADE THAT ALL KNOWING BASTARD FEEL DUMB FOR SECOND AND PROVED THAT MANKIND IS UNPREDICTABLE EITHER WAY A WIN WIN FUCK THE IT'S ALL OR NOTHING
EASY CHOICE TAKE OPTION B TAKE ONLY THE MILLION DOLLAR BOX ALL SIGNS LEAD TO THERE BEING A MILLION DOLLARS IN THERE IF FOR SOME REASON I AM WRONG I HAVE LOST DOLLARS WHICH ISN'T A BIG DEAL
I'D TAKE BOTH BOXES THE SIB WOULD PREDICT THAT I CAN ALWAYS USE BOXES TO PUT STUFF IN

THE MONEY IF ANY IS A WELCOME BONUS
I WOULD TAKE BOX B ONLY AND IF IT TURNED OUT TO BE EMPTY I WOULD THEN SELL MY SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC AS SOMEONE WHO CAN OUTTHINK A ENTITY
TAKE NO BOXES AND LIVE A LIFE OF HAPPINESS FRIENDSHIPS AND SELF SUFFICIENCY

EPICURUS
A MILLION IS A LOT MORE THAN A THOUSAND GIVEN THAT THIS PARADOX HAS PRODUCED A SCHISM ABOUT WHAT DO AMONG PHILOSOPHERS THERE IS NO SAFE METHOD OR TECHNIQUE TO GUARANTEE THAT YOU CAN BE SURE OF NOT RISKING THE LOSS OF A MILLION DOLLARS PRUDENTIAL REASONING COMMANDS THAT I ONLY SELECT BOX B
THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM ITSELF THE CORRECT ANSWER CHANGES DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE SUPERINTELLIGENT BEING IS NECESSARILY RIGHT EVERY TIME OR JUST REALLY REALLY GOOD AT GUESSING
THIS HAS ME SHOOK I'D STILL CHOOSE B THOUGH I'D STILL CHOOSE B
IN A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION I WOULD TAKE B ONLY HUMANS ARE PREDICTABLE ENOUGH FOR A SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE TO GUESS THE CHOICE WITH HIGH ENOUGH PROBABILITY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FOR TO STILL BE FAVORABLE

IN A REAL SETTING HOWEVER I WOULD ASSUME THIS WHOLE GAME IS A PART OF A THE SYSTEM LIKE PROGRAM AND THE SIB DOESN'T HAVE ANY SORT OF ABILITY AND I WOULD CHOOSE BOTH
CHOOSE B EITHER YOU GET AND ALL IS WELL OR YOU OUTPLAY A MACHINE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN WRONG AND YOU USE YOUR FAME TO BE EVEN MORE WEALTHY IN THE FUTURE IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO WIN BIG REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE MACHINE HAS ALREADY DETERMINED YOU WOULD DO IN THE PAST
A LITTLE LATE BUT WHAT IF YOU FORCE YOUR OWN CHOICE TO BE RANDOM

THAT IS YOU ARBITRARILY ASSIGN CHOICE TO HEADS AND CHOICE 2 TO TAILS THEN FLIP THAT COIN AND STICK WITH THAT DECISION

EVEN IF THE SIB KNOWS EVERYTHING YOU DID DOES THIS FORCE THE SIB TO DO NO BETTER THAN BY DEFAULT
I WOULD FLIP A COIN HEADS I TAKE BOTH TAILS I TAKE B THAT WAY I HAVE A FIFTY-FIFTY CHANCE OF GETTING THE MILLION WHICH I WOULD GLADLY LOSE FOR
I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW ANY KIND OF CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE IS MAKING ITS PREDICTION THE SLEEPING BEAUTY PROBLEM IS A MORE INTERESTING VARIANT OF THIS AS IT RELIES ON SOMEONE MAKING A DECISION AND THEN HAVING THEIR MEMORY ERASED RATHER THAN SOMEONE ELSE PREDICTING THEIR BEHAVIOUR
ONE BOX SEEMS SO OBVIOUSLY CORRECT TO ME
AS LONG AS THE THE UNIVERSE IS DETERMINISTIC ENOUGH THAT RANDOMNESS BASED ON SOM KIND OF UNPREDICTABLE QUANTUM PHYSICS PERHAPS DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE DECISION SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH TO ALTER IT AND AS LONG AS THE ACT OF PLACING THE MONEY IN THE BOX DOESN'T EITHER THEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING UP TO THE DECISION ARE ALL SET IN MOTION AHEAD OF TIME IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SUPER INTELLIGENCE WOULD BE ABLE TO PREDICT THE DECISION

IF YOU ARE THE TYPE OF PERSON WHO WOULD MAKE AN ENTIRELY RATIONAL DECISION YOU CAN KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE THE SUPER INTELLIGENCE WILL HAVE PREDICTED THUS IT'S A SIMPLE MATTER OF SELECTING THE BOX THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE MOST MONEY IF YOU PLAY BY THE RULES OF THE GAME FOLLOWING A STRICTLY RATIONAL DECISION THE MOST THAT IS POSSIBLE TO GET WOULD BE BY CHOOSING TO TAKE ONLY BOX B THIS IS A GOOD RESULT BUT NOT OPTIMAL

THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET MORE ASSUMING THAT THERE ISN'T ANY WAY OF GAINING DIRECT OR INDIRECT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS UNDER THE BOX IS BY FOOLING THE SUPERINTELLIGENCE IN ORDER TO DO THIS YOU NEED TO MAKE A SUFFICIENTLY IRRATIONAL DECISION THAT MERE RANDOMNESS IF SUCH EVEN EXISTS OR THE ACT OF PLACING THE MONEY IS ENOUGH TO ALTER THE DECISION AFTER THE PREDICTION HAS BEEN MADE EFFECTIVELY YOU'RE RELYING ON CHAOS THEORY TO SWAY THE DECISION

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IF THE UNKNOWN VARIABLES ARE TOO SUBTLE TO AFFECT THE DECISION THE SUPERINTELLIGENCE WILL BE ABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THE TIME IN THIS CASE YOU WILL EITHER END UP WITH OR DEPENDING ON WHICH OF THE TWO OPTIONS YOU END UP CHOOSING NEITHER IS OF THEM ARE OPTIMAL AND ONE IS REALLY BAD YOU ARE UNABLE TO FOOL THE SUPERINTELLIGENCE ATTEMPTING TO DO SO ANYWAYS IS STRICTLY WORSE THAN MAKING A RATIONAL DECISION

IF THE UNKNOWN VARIABLES SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO ALTER THE DECISION SAY FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A BUTTON WHICH THROUGH SOME QUANTUM MECHANICAL MAGIC CAN SPIT OUT COMPLETELY RANDOM RESULTS HAVING THE TO CHANGE THE DECISION IS NOT ENOUGH THE DECISION ACTUALLY HAS TO BE ALTERED TOO IF THE BUTTON RANDOMLY SELECTS THE SAME DECISION TWICE YOU GET THE SAME RESULT AS BEFORE EITHER OR DEPENDING ON WHICH OPTION YOU CHOSE IF YOU ACTUALLY MANAGE TO FOOL THE SUPER INTELLIGENCE YOU WILL EITHER END UP WITH OR USING PURE RANDOMNESS YOU HAVE A CHANCE OF RECEIVING THE OPTIMAL REWARD BUT THE EXPECTED VALUE WHEN USING THIS METHOD IS IF YOU RELY ON SOMETHING LESS RANDOM SUCH AS THE SUBTLE EFFECTS OF CHAOS THEORY THE OUTCOME WILL BE MORE PREDICTABLE AND RESULT IN A LOWER CHANCE OF RECEIVING AN OPTIMAL REWARD YET STILL THE SAME LOW EXPECTED VALUE
YOU KNOW THE ATTACHMENT TO FEELS A BIT LIKE A MONKEY TRAP ATTEMPTING TO HOLD ONTO THAT CAUSES YOU TO LOSE THE AND YET PEOPLE KEEP CLINGING TO IT SOMEHOW CONVINCED THAT THEY HAVE A WAY TO TRICK A AND TAKE BOTH BOXES WITHOUT IT HAVING PREDICTED THE FACT
IT LOOKS LIKE THE MAIN ASSUMPTION BEHIND BOTH BOXES APPROACH IS THAT SINCE CONTENT IS SET IN STONE BEFOREHAND YOUR DECISION CANNOT INFLUENCE EXPECTED CONTENT OF BOX B IN OTHER WORDS PRESENT CANNOT INFLUENCE PAST THIS ASSUMPTION IS WRONG

LET'S ASSUME THAT BEING IS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO PREDICT THE CORRECT OUTCOME OF THE TIME I EAST IF SIB PREDICTS BOTH BOXES OF THE TIME PLAYER INDEED ENDS UP TAKING BOTH BOXES

NOW LET'S ASSUME THAT PLAYERS CHOOSE BOTH OPTIONS EQUALLY LET'S SAY THAT OUT OF PLAYERS CHOSE BOTH BOXES AND CHOSE BOX B ONLY SITUATION LOOKS LIKE THIS

PLAYER CHOOSES BOTH PLAYER CHOOSES B ONLY

SIB PREDICTS BOTH TIMES 2 TIMES
SIB PREDICTS B ONLY TIMES TIMES

THE TABLE IS IN LINE WITH OUR ASSUMPTIONS PLAYERS CHOSE BOTH CHOSE B ONLY SIB PREDICTS BOTH CORRECTLY OUT OF TIMES AND PREDICTS B ONLY CORRECTLY OUT OF TIMES

NOW TO GO TO THE CORE OF THE QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK INVERSE QUESTION IF PLAYER CHOOSES BOTH WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY OF SIB PREDICTING BOTH IT HAPPENS OUT OF TIMES OR ROUGHLY HOWEVER IF PLAYER CHOOSES B ONLY PROBABILITY OF SIB PREDICTING BOTH DROPS TO 2 OUT OF TIMES OR IN OTHER WORDS PLAYER CHOOSING DIFFERENTLY CHANGES THE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT SIB PREDICTION YOU CAN RATIONALIZE IT HOWEVER YOU WANT BUT THIS IS WHAT RATHER SIMPLE MATH CLEARLY SHOWS

IN THAT SCENARIO EXPECTED GAIN FOR PLAYER CHOOSING BOTH IS OR ABOUT THOUSAND EXPECTED GAIN FOR PLAYER CHOOSING B ONLY IS OR THOUSAND CLEARLY CHOOSING B ONLY IS MORE PROFITABLE

NOTE THAT I DIDN'T ASSUME SIB IS INFALLIBLE IT'S RIGHT ONLY OF THE TIME IF WE INCREASE THIS PROBABILITY B ONLY WILL BE EVEN BETTER CHOICE

ASSUMPTION THAT YOUR DECISION CANNOT INFLUENCE PREDICTION IS ESSENTIALLY AN ASSUMPTION THAT SIB HAS NO PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY I EAST IT GUESSES RANDOMLY AND IS CORRECT OF THE TIME I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS AN UNREASONABLE ASSUMPTION BUT PROBLEM STATEMENT SUGGESTS OTHERWISE

ALSO THE FACT THAT THE PREDICTION ALREADY HAPPENED IN THE PAST DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF WE MODIFY THE GAME TO LET THE PLAYER CHOOSE FIRST EAST G WRITE YOUR CHOICE DOWN WITHOUT SHOWING IT TO SIB AND THEN LET THE SIB PREDICT AND DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE SAME GAME THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IN BOTH CASES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT SIB PREDICTED AND SIB DOESN'T HAVE A DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR CHOICE WHETHER THE PREDICTION HAPPENS BEFORE OR AFTER PLAYER'S CHOICE IS IRRELEVANT
I WISH DOUGLAS ADAMS SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED THIS
YOU SHOULD TAKE B EVERY TIME

WHY BECAUSE TO CORRECTLY PREDICT SUCH EVENTS WITH NEAR ACCURACY THE MACHINE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO RUN SOME KIND OF SIMULATION THEREFORE YOU MAY BE IN A SIMULATION BEING RUN BY THE MACHINE TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME

PHILOSOPHER A SAYS YOU CANNOT INFLUENCE THE MACHINE'S DECISION IN THE PAST BY ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE PRESENT BUT IF YOU ARE THE SIMULATED YOU THEN YOU CAN INFLUENCE THE MACHINE YOU SHOULD TAKE BOX B EVERY TIME BECAUSE NO DOUBT THE SIMULATION WILL BE RUN MANY TIMES TO GET A STATISTICAL AVERAGE THE MORE CONFIDENT YOU ARE IN THE DECISION THE MORE LIKELY THE MACHINE WILL PUT THE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BOX

IT'S JUST COMMON SENSE
HAS THIS ARTICLE PHRASED THE PROBLEM CORRECTLY NOTHING IN IT SUGGESTS THE SIB HAS ANY PROBLEM WITH ME GETTING A LOT OF MONEY

AS PHRASED THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO AN ABSOLUTELY HONEST PERSON SAYING TO ME PICK BOX B AND I WILL GIVE YOU OR PICK BOTH BOXES AND I WILL GIVE YOU

WE COULD THINK MAYBE THE PERSON ISN'T HONEST AND WILL ACTUALLY GIVE ME IF I PICK BOTH BOXES BUT THAT IS JUST TO DENY THE HYPOTHETICAL WHICH WAS SET
I'M SURPRISED THAT NO ONE HAS SUGGESTED FLIPPING A COIN TO MAKE THE CHOICE
PICK ONLY BOX A AND RENDER THE PREDICTION INCORRECT THEN TELL YOUR FRIEND THAT THE BEING CANNOT INFLUENCE THE PAST AND THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES
WHEN I WAS BUT A WEE LASS MY FATHER PUT TO ME THE FOLLOWING RIDDLE

IF A MAN AND A HALF CAN DIG A HOLE IN A HALF IN A DAY AND A HALF THEN HOW MANY PANCAKES DOES IT TAKE TO SHINGLE A DOGHOUSE

LIKE MOST PEOPLE I EXPECT OR AT LEAST LIKE MOST KIDS I PRESUME I OBSESSED OVER THE FIRST PART ALL BUT ENTIRELY IGNORING THE SECOND PART I SPENT A VERY LONG TIME PONDERING THE QUESTION OCCASIONALLY ASKING TO HAVE IT REPEATED IN CASE I MISSED SOME DETAIL THAT WOULD HELP ME SOLVE IT EVENTUALLY I OFFERED AN ANSWER NONE

WHY MY FATHER ASKED

BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A MAN AND A HALF OR A HOLE AND A HALF SO THE QUESTION IS NONSENSE OR SOME VERSION THEREOF IN LESS ELEGANT KID LANGUAGE

NO MY FATHER SAID THE ANSWER IS ONE HE THEN CHALLENGED ME TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WAS THE CORRECT ANSWER I EVENTUALLY REALISED THAT A PANCAKE CAN BE OF ANY ARBITRARY SIZE SO YOU'D ONLY EVER NEED ONE NO MATTER THE SIZE OF THE THING YOU WANT TO COVER BUT THE FIRST PART STILL FRUSTRATED ME BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH OBVIOUS NONSENSE AND HERE'S WHERE I LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN LOGIC THAT LEADS ME TO A CONFIDENT ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM

THE ANSWER IS THAT IN A LOGIC PROBLEM YOU ARE NOT TO QUESTION THE GIVEN THE GIVEN MIGHT SEEM IRRATIONAL BUT IT'S THE SET OF RULES THAT FRAME THE PROBLEM AND IF YOU DISTRUST THE GIVEN THEN THE ENTIRE PROBLEM FALLS APART THE QUESTION DIDN'T ASK IF THERE WAS OR COULD BE ANY SUCH THING AS A MAN IN A HALF OR A HOLE AND A HALF IT ASKED IF A MAN AND A HALF COULD DIG A HOLE AND A HALF IN A DAY AND A HALF THEN HOW MANY PANCAKES DOES IT TAKE TO SHINGLE A DOGHOUSE

DR ANSWER ACCEPTS THE GIVEN ON ITS OWN TERMS AND DOES NOT CHALLENGE IT TO DO SO WOULD BE TO DISMANTLE THE PROBLEM ITSELF RENDERING ANY ANSWER TO IT USELESS OR AT LEAST MEANINGLESS DR EDMONDS ANSWER DOES AN AROUND THE QUESTION HE SPECULATES THAT HE CAN DERAIL THE TROLLEY INSTEAD OF HAVING TO CHOOSE WHO TO KILL BUT THE GIVEN DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THAT OPTION

THE GIVEN STATES THAT THE BEING HAS NEVER MADE A BAD PREDICTION THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO NEVER GUESSES WRONG IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO DEFEAT THE GUESSES NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO OR ELSE SOMEONE WOULD HAVE DONE IT AT SOME POINT AND NO ONE EVER HAS IT LOGICALLY FOLLOWS FROM THAT THAT WHATEVER CHOICE YOU MAKE WILL BE THE CORRECT ONE AND UNLESS SOME OTHER FACTOR INTERVENES TO MAKE YOU CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY YOU'LL PICK THE BOX WITH THE CHEQUE IN IT

DR ANSWER SPECULATES THAT THE SIB CAN BE WRONG WHICH MIGHT BE TRUE BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THAT CONJECTURE THE EVIDENCE FORCEFULLY ARGUES THE OPPOSITE THAT THE SIB NEVER GUESSES WRONG SO THE BEST CHOICE IS OBVIOUSLY THE ONE THAT WILL HAVE THE MOST GAIN FOR YOU THE SIB HAD TO HAVE SEEN THAT COMING AND ALSO HAD TO KNOW THAT YOU WOULD LEARN THAT SHE NEVER MISSES DR APPROACH IS THAT OF THE SICILIAN IN THE PRINCESS BRIDE WHO TRIES TO OUTWIT HIS OPPONENT AND IN THE PROCESS OUTWITS HIMSELF HE SPECULATES ON HOW THE SIB COULD BE WRONG BUT THE GIVEN DOESN'T ALLOW FOR THAT OPTION IT CLEARLY AFFIRMS THAT THE SIB IS NEVER WRONG IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT ALL WE NEED TO KNOW IS THAT SHE IS ALWAYS RIGHT

THE SOLUTION IS INCONSEQUENTIAL BECAUSE THE CHOICE HAS ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED THE INTELLIGENT BEING IS NOT STATED AS HAVING ANY PREFERENCE REGARDING YOUR SUCCESS SO THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT CHOOSING B ONLY WILL YIELD THE HIGHER AMOUNT THE ONLY GUARANTEE OF HAVING ANY MONEY AT ALL IS BY CHOOSING BOTH BOXES

ANOTHER TAKE ON THIS WOULD BE TO THINK OF BOX B AS BEING SUPERIMPOSED HAVING BOTH NOTHING AND THE MILLION AT THE SAME INSTANCE ONLY WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO KNOW THE CONTENTS OF BOX B IS IT FORCED TO HAVE EITHER OR TO YOU THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE BUT THE INTELLIGENT BEING WOULD EITHER HAVE TO KNOW YOUR CHOICE OR THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX SINCE IT KNOWS YOUR CHOICE THEN THE CONTENTS OF BOX B IS TRULY PROBABILISTIC STILL THE ONLY GUARANTEE OF WALKING AWAY WITH ANY MONEY WOULD BE TO CHOOSE BOTH BOXES

THUS MY CHOICE WOULD BE BOTH BOXES
THE PREMISE IS WRONG THE FUTURE OF A COMPLEX SYSTEM IS UNPREDICTABLE A BEING THAT CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE WITH COMPLETE ACCURACY CANNOT EXIST CREATING A PROBLEM WITH AN IMPOSSIBLE PREMISE LEADS TO MENTAL GYMNASTICS THAT CAN HAVE NO MORE RELEVANCE TO REALITY THAN THE IMPOSSIBLE PREMISE PHILOSOPHY THAT IS PREDICATED UPON AN IMPOSSIBLE PREMISE IS A WASTE OF MENTAL EFFORT
I THINK THE KEY IS TO ACT BEFOREHAND TO MAKE YOURSELF SOMEONE WHO WILL ONLY CHOOSE BOX
I DON'T OFTEN SEE MY LAST NAME IN AN ARTICLE

REMINDS ME OF THIS SCENE FROM THE PRINCESS BRIDE
WATCH V T
THE CLAIM YOU CANNOT INFLUENCE A DECISION MADE IN THE PAST BY A DECISION MADE IN THE PRESENT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE TRUE IF THE SIB IS TRULY A FLAWLESS PREDICTOR OF THE FUTURE

AFTER READING THE PROBLEM LIKE TIMES I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION OF CHOOSING BOTH IF SHE HAS ALREADY PREDICTED THINGS I'VE DONE IN THE PAST TAKING BOTH IS THE BETTER CHOICE BECAUSE BEFORE I KNEW ABOUT HER PREDICTIONS I HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN BOTH SO IF SHE HAS PREDICTED THAT SAME THING THEN TAKING B ONLY WOULD CAUSE ME TO FIND AN EMPTY BOX AND I WOULD LOSE OUT ON THE
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE CHOICE YOU SHOULD MAKE IT'S ABOUT THE TYPE OF PERSON YOU ARE

YOU ARE EITHER A BOTH PERSON OR A B PERSON

SINCE B IS MORE LUCRATIVE I AM A B PERSON

THIS IS ALSO ASSUMING SIB IS RIGHT
I CURIOUS WETHER THIS COULD BE COMPARED TO A TEST OF FAITH

IN MY OPINION IT IS THE RATIONAL THING TO CHOOSE BOTH EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T COME TO THIS CONCLUSION WITHOUT THE EXPLANATIONS SO CLEARLY THE SIB WOULD HAVE PREDICTED ME BEING RATIONAL AND CONVINCIBLE TO CHOOSE BOTH I AM THEREFORE DOOMED TO RECEIVE ONLY REGARDLESS OF MY CHOICE
THE SIB IS NOT PREDICTING MY DECISION IT'S PREDICTING MY CHARACTER

HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE A PERSON WHO CHOOSES TO TAKE B OUT OF CONVICTION OF BEING THAT KIND OF PERSON WITHOUT THE EXPLANATIONS IT WOULD BE SENSIBLE BUT AFTER READING THEM THE PERSON MUST THINK OF THEMSELVES AS BEING IRRATIONAL

EDIT CORRECTION I WOULD BE DOOMED TO RECEIVE ONLY OR NOTHING I AM THIS KIND OF PERSON AND BEING DISHONEST WITH MYSELF WOULD NET ME A BOX B WITH
IS SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY RELATIVELY SPEAKING IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO RISK LOSING BY TAKING BOTH WHEN YOU ONLY RISK LOSING BY TAKING B ALONE
I TAKE BOX B ONLY

BUT I FIND I'M VERY CONFUSED BY THE REASONING OF BOTH SIDES OF THE DEBATE

DOES IT MOVE POSITION IF WE ASSUME THE BEING IS MERELY VERY GOOD AT PREDICTING RATHER THAN PERFECT

DOES IT MOVE POSITION IF WE ALLOW THE BEING TO HAVE BEEN LYING TO US AND HASN'T BEEN PREDICTING AT ALL AND INSTEAD HAS BEEN ACHIEVING HER RESULT BY SOME OTHER METHOD

FROM WHAT LITTLE EVIDENCE WE ARE PRESENTED WITH IN THIS HYPOTHETICAL THESE THINGS COULD BE TRUE AND SEEM TO ME TO PUSH FOR A SOLUTION
I WOULD COMMIT TO ONLY TAKING B THEN I WOULD ONLY TAKE B TAKING BOTH SEEMS TO BE RELYING ON UNKNOWNS ABOUT HOW THE SIB IS MAKING THE PREDICTION SINCE IT'S APPARENTLY NEVER WRONG AND SINCE I KNOW I WANT THE MOST MONEY I WILL TAKE B AND NOT ASSUME FALLIBILITY OF A SUPPOSEDLY INFALLIBLE SIB
I'D TAKE

WITHIN THE RULES OF THE PROBLEM THE AI IS KNOWN TO BE INFALLIBLE THE CHANCE THAT I WHO AM NOT A CLEVER MAN WOULD BE THE FIRST PREDICTION FAILURE SEEMS NEGLIGIBLE

IF I CHOOSE BOX B AND IT'S EMPTY THEN THE AI MADE A FALSE PREDICTION PREDICTING I WOULD CHOOSE A OR A B THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY
IF I TAKE BOTH BOXES AND GET THAT MEANS THAT THE AI FALSELY PREDICTED THAT I WOULD CHOOSE BOX B ONLY THAT ALSO SEEMS UNLIKELY
GIVEN THAT THOSE TWO FAILURES SEEM HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND A CORRECT PREDICTION IS FAR MORE LIKELY I'LL CHOOSE BOX B WITH REASONABLY HIGH CONFIDENCE THAT IT WILL CONTAIN

ANOTHER WAY TO EVALUATE THE PROBLEM IS SIMPLE RISK ANALYSIS WOULD I BE WILLING TO SPEND OF SOMEONE MONEY FOR A HIGHLY PROBABLE CHANCE OF GETTING OF COURSE I COULD USE THE GRAND BUT I COULD USE A FULL ROCK EVEN MORE SINCE I STAND TO LOSE BOTH IF I MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE THE RISK OF GIVING UP THE MILLION IN BOX B IS GREATER
I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY I'M NOT A GAMBLING MANUAL
I CAN RISK THE MILLION DOLLAR CHANCE OR I CAN BE SURE OF

I'LL TAKE BOTH BOXES
BASED ON THE INFORMATION GIVEN AND NOTHING MORE I WOULD CHOOSE BOX B ONLY IF THE RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE AI HAS NEVER BEEN WRONG AND IF IT IS AS SMART AS THE INFORMATION LEADS US TO BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE ALREADY PREDICTED THAT I WOULD MAKE THIS CHOICE AND PUT THE MILLION IN THE BOX IF I TAKE BOTH BOXES TO AT LEAST GUARANTEE THE THOUSAND THE AI WOULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT AND LEFT BOX B EMPTY I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE TO TRICK THE AI IN THIS SCENARIO IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO WOULD PICK BOTH YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST THE MILLION IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO WOULD PICK BOX B WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT YOU ARE GUARANTEED THE MILLION WHETHER YOU ATTEMPT TO TRICK THE AI IS IRRELEVANT AS IT IS LIKELY TO HAVE PREDICTED THAT AS WELL
I WOULD REMOVE MY OWN AGENCY FROM THE DECISION WHICH WOULD ROB THE AI OF ITS ABILITY TO PREDICT MY CHOICE I WOULD USE A TRUE ANG TO GIVE ME A TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE CHOICE AFTER THE AI HAS MADE ITS PREDICTION THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO EVER WIN THE BUT IT WILL ONLY HAPPEN IN OF GAMES PLAYED
I TAKE BOTH BOXES MY REASON IS THAT DURING THE READING OF THE DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS I SAW THERE WAS AN OPTION TO TAKE BOTH I IMMEDIATELY KNEW THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO IT WASN'T UNTIL I SAW THERE WAS AN AI MAKING DECISIONS THAT I DECIDED TO THINK FURTHER

SINCE THE AI LIKELY KNOWS THIS IT WOULD LIKELY NOT LEAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE AI IS A DICK
WHY CAN'T I JUST TAKE BOX A I'M HAPPY WITH AND IF BOX B IS EMPTY IT'S THE ONLY CHOICE FOR THE MOST MONEY
I FEEL LIKE THIS QUESTION REALLY BOILS DOWN TO HOW STRONGLY DO YOU TRUST THE SIB TO BE RIGHT IF YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT IT CAN PREDICT YOUR ACTIONS DOWN TO THE LAST DETAIL THE CLEAR CHOICE IS TO PICK JUST BOX B WHILE IF YOU THINK THE SIB IS GUESSING THE CLEAR CHOICE IS TO TAKE BOTH ANYTHING ELSE IS A GRADATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO EXTREMES
IS THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING TRYING TO HELP YOU RECEIVE THE MOST MONEY OR WORKING AGAINST YOU TO CHOOSE THE LEAST AMOUNT
THIS IS MISSING A KEY PIECE OF INFORMATION WHEN HOW DOES THE BEING MAKE IT'S PREDICTION IF IT MAKES IT OFF EXAMINING YOUR PREVIOUS CHOICES AND PERSONALITY THAN PICKING BOTH BOXES IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT OF THE TIME IF IT'S A MIND READER AND MAKES ITS PREDICTION AFTER THE PROBLEM IS EXPLAINED TO YOU THAN PICKING ONLY B IS OBVIOUSLY CORRECT

IF YOU DON'T GET TO KNOW WHEN HOW IT PREDICTS THAN IT BOILS DOWN TO A GAMBLE AND NOT A PHILOSOPHY QUESTION IS THE CHANCE FOR MILLION WORTH LOSING OUT ON A GUARANTEED BY HOPING IT PREDICTS THE SECOND WAY
IF THE SIB ALREADY KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO PICK DOES IT EVEN MATTER WHAT YOU PICK
I MIGHT CHOOSE BOTH BOXES

BUT I CHOSE B IN THE POLL CHECKMATE
IF SIB HAS A PERFECT TRACK RECORD YOU CANNOT EVER KNOW WHETHER YOU ARE MAKING THE ACTUAL CHOICE OR EXPERIENCING A PERFECT PREDICTION

OBVIOUSLY YOU SHOULD CHOOSE B IF YOU'RE THE PREDICTION AND BOTH IF YOU'RE MAKING THE CHOICE IN ABSENCE OF THAT DATA PICK B EVERY TIME
I WOULD ALWAYS JUST TAKE B BECAUSE OF GREED WHO CARES ABOUT A GRAND CHICKEN FEED
THE SIB HAS NEVER BEEN WRONG
THEREFORE B

IT IS YOUR ACTION THAT DETERMINES HER FORECAST

GOOGLE RETROCAUSALITY
REALLY THIS HAS TO DO WITH WHETHER THE SIB IS BOUND BY CONVENTIONAL PHYSICS AND WHETHER THEY CAN CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX DEPENDING ON YOUR CHOICE

IF THE SIB CAN'T CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THE BOXES DEPENDING ON YOUR CHOICE OBVIOUSLY YOU SHOULD PICK BOTH
IF THE SIB CAN CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THE BOXES DEPENDING ON YOUR CHOICE OBVIOUSLY YOU SHOULD PICK B

REALLY THE QUESTION COMES DOWN TO WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THAT THE SIB IN QUESTION IS BOUND BY CONVENTIONAL PHYSICS LIKE A HUMAN OR WHETHER THEY CAN ALTER THE UNIVERSE PROGRAMMATICALLY LIKE A PROGRAMMER DICTATING THE INTERNAL STATE OF A SIMULATION

IN OTHER WORDS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THIS

CONVENTIONAL PHYSICS YOU SHOULD CHOOSE BOTH
PREDICTION
CHOICE

IF PREDICTION
BOXES
ELSE IF PREDICTION OPTION B
BOXES


IF CHOICE
RETURN BOXES
ELSE IF CHOICE OPTION B

OR THIS

BLACK MAGIC YOU SHOULD CHOOSE B

WOULD A MINIMAX NOT GIVE US A BETTER OUTCOME THE MAXIMIN VALUE OF A PLAYER IS THE LARGEST VALUE THAT THE PLAYER CAN BE SURE TO GET WITHOUT KNOWING THE ACTIONS OF THE OTHER PLAYERS MASCHLER ET AL WHEREAS IN A MINIMAX APPROACH WE WOULD HAVE MINIMIZED LOSSES BEFORE THE RELEVANT INFORMATION IS GIVEN ALLOWING US TO MAXIMIZE OUR VALUE KNOWING THE OTHER PLAYER'S CHOICE THIS WOULD PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE IN THIS EXACT SCENARIO SEEING AS IT IS NOT A ZERO SUM GAME

MICHAEL MASCHLER EGLON SOLAN SHMUEL ZAMIR GAME THEORY CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS PP
TAKE BOTH BOXES GET MONEY AND TWO EMPTY BOXES S
THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD PROBABILITY QUESTION
IF FROM YOUR UNDERSTANDING THE SIB IS CORRECT AT LEAST TIMES THEN YOU SHOULD CHOOSE B IF THE SIB IS CORRECT LESS THAN THEN YOU SHOULD CHOOSE BOTH

YOU CAN ARGUE FREE WILL AND ABILITY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT THOSE BECOME JUST MORE DETAILS TO ANSWER THE MATH QUESTION

IF YOU BELIEVE SIB PREDICTS THE FUTURE WHICH SEEMS EVIDENCED BY THE PERCENTAGE OF CORRECT ANSWERS IN THE PAST THEN YOU SHOULD TAKE B

IF YOU BELIEVE SIB IS JUST GOSH DARN SUPER LUCKY THE BACKGROUND DOES NOT SEEM TO SUPPORT THIS THEN YOU SHOULD TAKE BOTH
THIS ALL DEPENDS ARE YOU AWARDED THE MONEY OR IS IT IN THE BOX BEFOREHAND IF ITS IN THE BOX BEFOREHAND YOU SHOULD PICK BOTH BECAUSE PHYSICAL OBJECTS CANNOT MOVE INCLUDING CHECKS IF ITS AWARDED TO YOU YOU SHOULD CHOOSE THE MILLION BECAUSE IT ONLY HAS A CHANCE OF EXISTENCE IF YOU PICK BOTH
THIS SEEMS LIKE A STEALTH FREEWILL DETERMINISM PROBLEM TO ME CAN THE SIB PREDICT YOUR CHOICE WITH OR AT LEAST NEAR CERTAINTY

IF YES THEN THE ANSWER IS B BECAUSE IF YOU PICKED B THEN THE SIB WAS ABLE TO PREDICT YOU WOULD PICK B THEREFORE THE BOX CONTAINS THE MONEY WHILE PICKING BOTH MEANS THE SIB PREDICTED YOU WOULD PICK BOTH AND THERE IS NO MONEY IN BOX B

IF THE SIB IS NOT ACCURATE THEN THIS BECOMES A MATH PROBLEM HONESTLY THOUGH MILLION VS IS SUCH A MASSIVE DISPARITY IN REWARD I'D IMAGING IF THE ODDS ARE EVEN SLIGHTLY TILTED TOWARDS THE PREDICTION BEING CORRECT BOX B IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT

A PREPARE TO PICK B OR SOMEHOW GET THE SIP TO KNOW YOU WILL PICK B
B PICK BOTH

THE PROBLEM SIMPLY LIES IN A CATCH IF YOU'RE INSANE YOU CAN'T GO HOME BUT YOU'RE ONLY SANE WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO GO HOME THE EXAMPLE I ALWAYS HEARD WHEN I WAS YOUNG WAS THAT YOU WANT TO START A CAR WASH BUSINESS BUT YOU NEED MATERIALS HOWEVER YOU NEED MONEY WHICH CAN ONLY GET VIA WASHING CARS TO BUY THE MATERIALS TO WASH THE CARS IN THIS CASE YOU CAN BREAK THE PARADOX BY HAVING MONEY TO BUY THE MATERIALS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I BELIEVE THAT IS SIMILAR TO THIS

ANOTHER VIEW IS MORE AKIN TO A PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTION THAN A PHILOSOPHICAL DILEMMA IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ARE NOT THE PERSON RECEIVING BOX A AND B OR JUST B BUT THE PERSON THINKING ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCE CURRENTLY IF YOU SEE THE ACCURACY AS THE CONSTANT THEN YOU ARE A B PERSON IF YOU SEE THE DIMENSION OF TIME AS THE CONSTANT YOU ARE AN A AND B PERSON I'D SAY IT'S SIMILAR TO VIEWING A 2D REPRESENTATION OF A CUBE IN THAT SOME SEE THE CUBE FACING ONE WAY AND THE OTHERS THE OTHER WAY
I WOULD JUST TAKE BOX A THEREFORE MAKING THE PREDICTION WRONG REGARDLESS THAT WAY I WILL GET THE AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF NOT GETTING THE HYPOTHETICAL CHEQUE
THE OTHER UNSTATED QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED IS HOW MUCH ARE THE BOXES WORTH

LET'S SAY THESE ARE REALLY NICE BOXES TOP OF THE LINE STUFF HERE JUST BEAUTIFUL AND ARTISTIC AND MADE FROM PURE PRINTER INK AND ANTIMATTER THEN YOU SHOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES

OR MAYBE YOU REALLY LIKE BOXES IN EITHER OF THESE SITUATIONS YOU SHOULD CLEARLY CHOOSE BOTH BOXES
FLIP THE QUESTION AROUND AND ASK IT THIS WAY

AS AN OBSERVER AND KNOWING WHAT YOU DO WOULD YOU BET AGAINST THE SIB
I TAKE B BECAUSE IF I OPEN B AND NOTHING IS IN IT IT IS THE FAULT THE WORST I CAN EVER BE ACCUSED OF IS MISSING OUT ON POUNDS THIS IS TRUE WHETHER OR NOT IF I TAKE A

ALSO FOR WHATEVER REASON BEFORE READING THE PREDICTION CLAUSE I FELT A TUG TO PICK B AND JUST B BECAUSE I WAS EXPECTING SOME WEIRD NONSENSE TO HAPPEN LATER IN THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
WELL GODS ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO TEACH SOMEONE A LESSON IF I WERE FACED WITH A TEST ORCHESTRATED BY A SUPREMELY INTELLIGENT BEING I WOULD GUESS THERE WAS A HIDDEN LESSON WHETHER THERE ACTUALLY WAS OR NOT

SO MY UPBRINGING TOUGH ME TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE LEAST AND NOT TO BE GREEDY

I WOULD TAKE B
YOU CANNOT INFLUENCE A DECISION MADE IN THE PAST BY A DECISION MADE IN THE PRESENT

YES BUT YOU CAN PREDICT A DECISION THAT WILL BE MADE IN THE FUTURE WHICH HAS THE SAME CONSEQUENCES IN THIS EXPERIMENT AS IF THE QUOTED STATEMENT WAS WRONG

TRANSPARENT GLASS SIDE

CHEATING
LET'S ASSUME MATERIALIST DETERMINISM HERE

PRESUMABLY THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THAT THE SIB CREATES A MODEL OF MY MIND AND RUNS A SIMULATION OF THE THOUGHT PROCESS MY MIND GOES THOUGH WHEN GIVEN THIS EXACT PROBLEM

GIVEN TRACK RECORD IN MODELLING EQUALLY OR MORE COMPLEX PROCESSES I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT SHE HAS PREDICTED EVERYTHING I AM THINKING RIGHT NOW SHE WILL HAVE PREDICTED THEN MY REALISATION THAT MY CURRENT TRAIN OF THOUGHT HAS BEEN MODELLED AHEAD OF TIME AND ALSO HOW THIS BELIEF WILL INFLUENCE MY ACTIONS

FROM THIS POINT IT COMES DOWN TO HOW MUCH YOU TRUST THE TRACK RECORD IF YOU ARE CONVINCED IT'S MODEL OF YOUR MIND IS ACCURATE YOUR DECISION ALTHOUGH NOT CAUSALLY LINKED TO THE PAST IS ESSENTIALLY NOT PRIVATE

SO IT MAKES SENSE TO ACT AS IF SIB IS WATCHING AND TO PICK B
I UNDERSTAND THE PREMISE BUT I FEEL THE UNDERLYING QUESTION IS MORE ABOUT THE SIB THAN THE PLAYERS CHOICE

SINCE THIS IS A LOGIC PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO BREAK DOWN EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION GIVEN THE SIB IS EITHER EFFECTIVELY A GOD KNOWING THE TOTALITY OF PHYSICS AND CURRENT STATE OF EXISTENCE INCLUDING THE CHEMISTRY GENETICS LIFE EXPERIENCES THAT MIGHT LEAD YOU TO A DECISION MEANING THERE IS NOTHING YOU COULD DO TO ALTER THE OUTCOME OR THE SIB IS FALLIBLE ALTHOUGH WITH A SPECTACULAR TRACK RECORD

SO MY CONCLUSION IS THAT YOU TAKE BOTH BECAUSE THE SET OF OUTCOMES FOR THAT IS EITHER OR M VS OR IT BOILS DOWN TO SOMETHING APPROXIMATING FATE VS FREE WILLIAM SEEING AS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS BEING OR ITS OWN DECISION MAKING IS AVAILABLE OTHER THAN ITS THE BEST YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE SIB BECOMES AN ACT OF FAITH BEING THAT THIS IS A LOGICAL PROBLEM FAITH IS IRRELEVANT IT REMINDS ME OF THE MONTY HALL PROBLEM IN THAT IT DISTRACTS YOU FROM THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM SIBS RELIABILITY WITH OTHER DETAILS SIB HAS BEEN RIGHT SO MANY TIMES THAT REALLY DONT OFFER CONCRETE SUPPORT FOR WHAT THE SIB WILL DO IN YOUR PARTICULAR CASE YOU CAN FLIP A COIN TIMES AND LAND HEADS EVERY SINGLE TIME DOESNT MEAN ITS ALWAYS GOING TO BE HEADS

ANYWAY I WROTE THIS ON MOBILE AFTER A BIT OF COMMODE PHILOSOPHY I LIKE TO BE WRONG TELL ME WHAT IM MISSING
SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE THREE DEFINITIONS OF OUR SIB

SUPER AI ABLE TO PREDICT YOUR ACTION BASED ON KNOWING HUMAN NATURE LIKE A PERSONALITY SIMULATOR FROM BLACK WHITE CHRISTMAS
2 OMNISCIENT KNOW THE FUTURE
REALLY LUCKY GUESSER NOT REALLY A SIB

IF YOU BELIEVE IN THEN YOU CAN FIND SOME SUPER RANDOM WAY OF CHOOSING THAT COULDN'T BE REPLICATED BY A SIMULATOR IS THERE SUCH A THING OR JUST CHOOSE B

IF YOU BELIEVE IN 2 YOU CHOOSE B BECAUSE THE FUTURE HAS BEEN DECIDED

IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOU CHOOSE BOTH BOXES BECAUSE THE PREDICTION HAS NO INFLUENCE ON YOUR CHOICE
THIS HYPER INTELLIGENCE SEEMS TO ME MORE OF A PSYCHIC ABILITY FOR MY MONEY I'D TEND TO AGREE WITH THOUGH PROCESS B JUST BECAUSE YOU ASSURE YOURSELF A NET GAIN OF AT LEAST DOLLARS I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC IN NOT GUARANTEEING YOURSELF SOMETHING PREDICATED ON ONLY A SEEMINGLY OMNISCIENT BEING
I FIGURE IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU WEIGHT THE POSSIBILITIES


FIRST POSSIBILITY THE SIB HAS REAL PREDICTIVE POWER NOT IMPOSSIBLE AN ALIEN RACE WHO'S PENETRATED THE VAGUENESS OF QUANTUM PHYSICS AND RENDERED IT DETERMINISTIC HAS A SUPERCOMPUTER WITH THE CAPACITY TO PREDICT FUTURE EVENTS BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE UNIVERSE WITH EXTREMELY HIGH ACCURACY TIME TRAVEL IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY WE'RE LIVING IN A SIMULATION AND OUR RESPONSE IS SCRIPTED IN ANY OF THESE CASES THE PREDICTION IS THE EFFECT OF THE DECISION WE MAKE THE DECISION BECOMES THE CAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH WE WAFFLE WHATEVER WE CHOOSE DETERMINES WHAT'S IN THE BOXES BOTH GETS YOU B GETS YOU


SECOND POSSIBILITY IT'S A SCAM WHOEVER'S BEHIND THIS IS AFTER FAME AND FORTUNE THEM BEING RIGHT IS ALL THAT MATTERS AND THEY WILL CHEAT TO BE RIGHT THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX ARE DETERMINED BY SLIGHT OF HAND WHATEVER YOU PICK THE PREDICTION WILL LINE UP BOTH GETS YOU B GETS YOU


THIRD POSSIBILITY THEY GUESSED AT YOUR RESPONSE BOTH GETS YOU AND AN UNKNOWN PROBABILITY OF B GETS YOU AN UNKNOWN PROBABILITY OF


FOURTH POSSIBILITY IT'S A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT EITHER BOX COULD CONTAIN ANYTHING BOTH GETS YOU UNKNOWN UNKNOWN B GETS YOU UNKNOWN


IF YOU WEIGHT ALL FOUR EQUALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT BOTH GIVING A CHANCE OF A CHANCE OF AND A CHANCE OF A TOTAL UNKNOWN B HAS A CHANCE OF AND A CHANCE OF A TOTAL UNKNOWN THE RISK REWARD HEAVILY FAVORS PICKING B ONLY


PICKING BOTH REQUIRES THAT YOU HEAVILY FAVOR THE THIRD POSSIBILITY WHILE DISMISSING THE FIRST TWO IT REQUIRES THAT YOU DISMISS THE VALIDITY OF THE SIB AND SO DISBELIEVE THE PRESENTERS WHILE STILL ACCEPTING THAT THEY'RE TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THE BOXES IT'S HEAVILY BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE VERACITY OF THE PRESENTERS ALTHOUGH WHAT YOU'D CONSIDER COMMON SENSE ASSUMPTIONS


THE NEUTRAL POSITION IS TO PICK ONLY B THE COMMON SENSE POSITION IS TO PICK BOTH


THE DISAGREEMENT STEMS FROM NEUTRAL AND COMMON SENSE NOT BEING THE SAME AS RIGHT AND WRONG THERE ARE ONLY TWO OPINIONS WHICH VARY IN THEIR VIABILITY BASED ON YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBLEM BEING BASED ON A NEUTRALITY THAT CONSIDERS ALL POSSIBILITIES OR A COMMON SENSE THAT ELIMINATES POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU CONSIDER UNLIKELY



EDIT MY CONCLUSION IS THAT ANYONE WHO IS CONFIDENT IN THEIR ANSWER IS WRONG FOR BEING UNJUSTIFIABLY ARROGANT
IF I KNEW THAT THE SIB WAS NEVER WRONG THEN I WOULD DETERMINE THAT FREE WILL IS AN ILLUSION AND THEREFORE I WOULD DETERMINE THAT JUST B IS THE BEST OPTION AND PICK IT SINCE IT THE SIB WAS NEVER WRONG I WOULD GET THE BIG
IN AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE I WOULD SAY BOTH BUT IF I ACTUALLY DID FACE SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION I WOULD THINK THERE'S A HIGHER THAN PROBABILITY THAT ALL MY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS MAY BE WRONG AND HENCE CHOOSE BOX B AS I DON'T WANT TO RISK LOSING A MILLION DOLLARS
I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE I'D CHOOSE
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SHE WILL CONTINUE PREDICTING RIGHT SHE COULD HAVE GOTTEN LUCKY THOUGH I WOULDN'T PERSONALLY PUT MY MONEY ON THAT FOR PRAGMATIC REASONS THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION ARISES WE DON'T KNOW THE PROCESS THAT SHE USES TO MAKE PREDICTIONS IS IT MAGIC IS IT A JUDGE OF CHARACTER CAN SHE READ MINDS IS SHE A TIME TRAVELER IS IT BASED ON AN ALGORITHMIC PROCESS OF DETERMINING ODDS OF AN OUTCOME HAPPENING

WHAT HAS THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING GOT TO DO WITH THE CHOICE THAT GOD KNOWS WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT GOD KNOWS

PERSONALLY IGNORING THE DISTRACTING AND MEANINGLESS ORNAMENTATION OF THE SIB I'D TAKE A SHOT AT THE A WIN OR LOSE DOESN'T MATTER MUCH TO ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER A MILLION POUNDS HOWEVER WOULD INDEED BE NICE
I'LL JUST TAKE BOX A AND REALLY CONFUSE THAT DIRTY SOUTH I B OR BETTER YET JUST THE LID OF BOX B WHO'S INTELLIGENT NOW
TAKE B ONLY I KNOW THERE'S AN SOUTH I B MAKING A PREDICTION AND THE SOUTH I B KNOWS THAT I KNOW THEY'RE MAKING A PREDICTION AND THE SOUTH I B KNOWS ALL OF THIS BEFORE THE PREDICTION IS MADE AND I KNOW THEY KNEW THAT SO THE LOGICAL CHOICE IS B
UMM TAKE BOTH LOL THE CONTENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DECIDED NO MATTER WHAT BOTH BOXES WILL NOT CHANGE THE VALUE ON THE INSIDE

TH SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING IS A GREAT GUESSER THIS DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT REGARDLESS IF SHE PUT MILLION DOLLARS IN B AND YOU TAKE B YOU GET A MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU TAKE BOTH YOU GET IF YOU ONLY TAKE B AND THE BOX IS EMPTY YOU GET IF YOU TAKE BOTH YOU GET

IT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY ANSWER THAT COULD SWAY YOU INTO TAKING JUST ONE BOX IS THAT THE CONTENTS WOULD CHANGE BASED ON YOUR DECISION IT WON'T UNLESS IT'S FIXED EVEN IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MINDSET RIGHT THEN AND THERE WITHOUT PRIOR INFLUENCE THE CONTENTS WILL NOT CHANGE

PHILOSOPHY SOUNDS FUN
VERY COOL I WENT BACK AND FORTH FOR AWHILE ON THIS BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK YOU CHOOSE B AS IT IS THE BEST CHANCE FOR THE BEST RESULT AND EITHER WAY YOU ARE ONLY RISKING

IF YOU CHOOSE BOTH THAN YOU ARE RISKING WHAT A FUN EXERCISE
WHAT IF I'M AN FU KIND OF PERSON AND I CHOOSE A JUST BECAUSE FULL CAUSE I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MONEY AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BIB TRYING TO PULL MY STRINGS
I WOULD TRY TO CONVINCE EVERYONE TO BASE THEIR DECISION ON THE OUTCOME OF A QUANTUM EXPERIMENT SUCH AS MEASURING THE SPIN OF AN ELECTRON IN A MIXED STATE IF THE SIB IS ABLE TO PREDICT CORRECTLY EVERY TIME THEN THE PROBABILISTIC INTERPRETATION OF QM WOULD HAVE TO BE CALLED INTO QUESTION THE BENEFIT TO SOCIETY OF SUCH KNOWLEDGE WOULD EASILY BE WORTH HUNDREDS OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDREDS OF TRILLIONS OF POUNDS WHOSE SUDDEN INJECTION INTO THE WORLD ECONOMY WOULD LIKELY CAUSE SEVERE INFLATION IN THE UK
I JUST READ THAT ENTIRE BLOG IN STEPHEN VOICE
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE QUESTION STATEMENT BREAKS CAUSALITY

BY DECIDING TO TAKE BOTH BOXES NOW A DECISION IS MADE IN THE PAST TO REMOVE THE CHECK FROM BOX B

IN THE UNIVERSE THIS QUESTION MAKES SENSE THE SIB WILL SCREW YOU IF YOU TAKE BOTH BOXES

B FOR GOD'S SAKE JUST TAKE BOX B
SINCE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SUPER INTELLIGENT ALL KNOWING BEING THIS IS NOT A RATIONAL QUESTION

BUT ASSUMING SUCH A PERSON EXISTS I WOULD CHOOSE B BECAUSE SHE ALREADY KNEW I WOULD AND BECOME RICHER


TAKE SOME NONDETERMINISTIC PROCESS IN THE UNIVERSE BASE YOUR CHOICE ON THAT
IT SEEMS TO ME THE PROPER ANSWER DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE SIB WHETHER THE SIB IS ABLE TO PERCEIVE THE FUTURE IS MERELY MAKING A PREDICTION BASED UPON MY PAST BEHAVIOR OR HAS SOME UNIQUE INSIGHT THAT DESPITE MY BELIEFS THAT I ACT DETERMINISTICALLY WITHOUT FREEWILL

ASSUMING NO DECISIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SIB IS AVAILABLE MY ANSWER WOULD BE

ROLL A
ON 2 OR I WOULD TAKE BOX B
ON OR I WOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES
THE OBVIOUS ANSWER IS THROWING A COIN
I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THE ANSWERS TO A PHILOSOPHY QUESTION ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BASED ON HOW TO GET THE MOST MONEY FROM YOUR DECISION A LOT OF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST CHOOSING JUST B ARE SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF YEAH BUT THERE IS A CHANCE YOU CAN HAVE BOTH

I CHOSE JUST B BECAUSE IT DID NOT CROSS MY MIND TO ANALYZE ANY AMOUNT OF RISK IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANOTHER THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN EXTRA IF I RECEIVED A MILLION IF THE QUESTION WAS CREATED IN ORDER TO JUDGE BETWEEN TWO OPTIONS THAN BOTH A AND B SHOULD BE MADE TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WAY THE REWARD AND PUNISHMENT ARE EQUAL RISKS TO MAKE THE MONEY SUCH HUGELY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS MAKES ME THINK THE QUESTION IN LESS ABOUT RISK AND MORE ABOUT GREED AND MOTIVATION
PICK B IT'S ABSURD TO POTENTIALLY THROW AWAY MILLION IN THE OFF CHANCE YOU SCORE AN EXTRA IF THE SIB IS ALWAYS RIGHT IT IS MUCH SAFER TO ASSUME IT HAS ACCESS TO ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE LIKE MY FUTURE MENTAL STATES OR AT LEAST MY ULTIMATE ACTION IN A DETERMINISTIC SENSE MAKING THE NOTION THAT I SHOULD TRY TO OUTSMART IT FOR PRETTY FOOLISH
USING GAME THEORY MAKES TAKING BOTH BOXES THE BETTER OPTION
FLIP A COIN ANARCHY
WHAT ABOUT PICKING THE A BOX THE ARTICLE MAKES IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE CHOOSER IS LIMITED TO PICKING EITHER THE B BOX OR BOTH BOXES RATHER THAN HAVING OPTIONS
I'D WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE SIB BEFORE MAKING THE DECISION MOST IMPORTANTLY HOW MANY THINGS HAS IT SUCCESSFULLY PREDICTED

A SUCCESS RATE OVER OR PREDICTIONS ISN'T ALL THAT AMAZING BUT IF THIS BEING HAS A SUCCESSFUL PREDICTION RATE OVER OR SO EVENTS I'D BE WILLING TO GAMBLE SOME MONEY

ALSO USEFUL WOULD BE SOME INSIGHT INTO WHAT INFORMATION THE SIB IS USING TO MAKE THEIR DECISIONS
IS IT JUST ME OR IS THIS PRETTY RETARDED AS A PHILOSOPHY QUESTION THIS IS MORE A LITERACY ASSESSMENT THAN A PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE

BUT HERE S THE THING THE TEST WAS SET BY A BEING WHO HAS ALREADY MADE A PREDICTION ABOUT WHAT YOU WILL DO IF HER PREDICTION WAS THAT YOU WOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES SHE LEFT B EMPTY IF HER PREDICTION WAS THAT YOU WOULD TAKE B ONLY SHE PUT A MILLION CHEQUE IN IT

BEFORE MAKING YOUR DECISION YOU DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND DISCOVER THAT THE BEING HAS NEVER MADE A BAD PREDICTION SHE PREDICTED LEICESTER WOULD WIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE THE VICTORIES OF BREVIT AND TRUMP AND THAT ED BALLS WOULD BE ELIMINATED YESTERDAY FROM STRICTLY COME DANCING SHE HAS CORRECTLY PREDICTED THINGS YOU AND OTHERS HAVE DONE INCLUDING IN SITUATIONS JUST LIKE THIS ONE NEVER ONCE GETTING IT WRONG IT S A REMARKABLE SO WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE BOTH BOXES OR JUST BOX B

SINCE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THE FIRST BOLDED PART THERE IS NO QUESTION TO ONLY TAKE B ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION NONE

NOW IF WE DON'T KNOW THAT IS THE CASE THEN IT IMMEDIATELY CHANGES TO TAKING BOTH BOXES

FORGET ABOUT OUTSMARTING OR TRICKING THE SIB THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE ASSUME SIB IS OMNIPOTENT AND KNOWS WHAT YOU WILL ULTIMATELY DO
TAKE BOTH BOXES BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SIB THINKS IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THE WAY SHE PREDICTED NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO
THINK OF THE SITUATION AS A FILM THAT SUPERIOR BEING HAS ALREADY SEEN SHE ALREADY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND NOW YOU'RE PLAYING OUT THE FILM AS THOUGH IT'S BEEN REWOUND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN PICK BOTH AND WIN BECAUSE SHE'S ALREADY SEEN THIS MOVIE AND KNOWS THE ENDING EVEN IF YOU MAKE A LAST-MINUTE DECISION TO TAKE BOTH BOXES YOU'RE NOT TRICKING THE BEING BECAUSE SHE KNOWS YOU'LL DO THAT
I WOULD FLIP A COIN AND LEAVE IT TO CHANCE HEADS IS BOTH AND TAILS IS B
THE ONLY QUESTION HERE IS IF THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING IS TRULY ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE HER TRACK RECORD DOESN'T MATTER SHE COULD PREDICT CORRECTLY FOR A MILLION YEARS AND STILL GET THIS ONE WRONG

AND ACCORDING TO QUANTUM PHYSICS WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE QUANTUM LEVEL EVERYTHING IS UNCERTAIN UNTIL OBSERVED SO I DON'T EVEN THINK THAT THE ABILITY TO TRULY PREDICT THE FUTURE EVEN EXISTS

THIS ARGUMENT HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY BEEN MADE A LONG TIME BEFORE GO TO WIKIPEDIA AND SEARCH FOR DEMON

SO IN THE END SINCE WE CAN NEVER TRULY KNOW FOR SURE IF THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING CAN TRULY PREDICT THE FUTURE IT IS A QUESTION OF WHICH WAY YOU BELIEVE IN

IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING IS RIGHT THEN YOU PICK B IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING IS BLUFFING PICK BOTH
MILLION
IF THE HAS EVEN A CHANCE OF HAVING ACCURATELY PREDICTED YOUR BEHAVIOR THEN HAS BETTER EXPECTED VALUE

CHANCE OF CHANCE OF M

CHANCE OF CHANCE OF

AND ANY CLEVER ARGUMENTS FOR JUST MAKE YOU EASIER TO PREDICTION
AM I WRONG OR IS THIS QUESTION MORE ABOUT HOW MUCH INFORMATION YOU HAVE RATHER THAN WHICH BOX TO CHOOSE

IF YOU HAVE ALL THE INFO STATED IN THE ARTICLE THEN YOU CHOOSE BOX B

IF YOU ONLY HAVE LIMITED INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU ARE UNAWARE THAT THE BEING PUT IN BOX B IF SHE PREDICTED YOU WOULD TAKE BOTH THE YOU WOULD TAKE BOTH
MAN IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE REALLY STOPPED AND THOUGHT SO DEEPLY ABOUT SOMETHING AND HAD MY OPINION EDGE BACK AND FORTH SO MANY TIMES

I AM SOLIDLY A IN THE END THOUGH BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE CHOOSER HAS NO IDEA OF THE PREDICTION THAT WAS MADE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE REASONING BEHIND THE PREDICTION BY THE TIME THE CHOOSER HAS ANY INPUT TO THE SITUATION THE PREDICTION HAS BEEN MADE THE BOXES SET AND NOTHING DONE IN THAT MOMENT HAS ANY EFFECT ON THE OUTCOME THE ONLY CHOICE TO BE MADE IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT THE GUARANTEED ON TOP OF WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE IN B

I CAN CERTAINLY SEE WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM TOO BUT TO ME THAT OPTION RELIES FAR TOO HEAVILY ON THE IDEAS THAT

THIS BEING FOR SOME REASON HAS YOUR BEST INTEREST IN MIND AND

2 SHE IS HONEST AND OR GIVES TWO SHITS ABOUT MAINTAINING HER ACCURACY STREAK

WHO'S TO SAY THAT SHE DIDN'T CALCULATE WITH PERFECT CERTAINTY THAT YOU WOULD CHOOSE TO TAKE B ONLY TO MAKE THE PREDICTION YOU WOULD TAKE BOTH JUST TO LAUGH AS YOU LEAVE WITH NOTHING MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED OR CRUEL BUT THIS MOTIVES ARE NEVER MADE CLEAR AND TO JUST ASSUME THAT YOUR MAXIMIZED WEALTH IS HER GOAL AS WELL AS YOUR OWN IS A QUICK WAY TO MISS OUT ON A SURE THING
A LITTLE LATE TO THE PARTY BUT THERE'S A THIRD SOLUTION WHICH MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS BOTH THE OTHERS

TAKE ONLY BOX A THE BEING BEING IS NOT GOING TO GIVE ME A MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO BE RIGHT SO TAKING BOX B IS A WASTE OF TIME

BUT WHY NOT TAKE BOTH AND BE SURE WELL TAKING ONLY BOX A IS CLEARLY BETTER THAN TAKING BOTH BOXES SINCE THEN I ONLY HAVE TO CARRY ONE BOX

SARCASM BUT THERE'S CLEARLY NO UNIQUE RIGHT SOLUTION UNLESS WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT THE SIB THAN IS GIVEN IN THE PROBLEM



THE RIDDLE LIKE THIS IS NOT REALLY PARADOXICAL YOU ARE GETTING THE CHANCE TO PICK DOLLARS OR MILLION DOLLARS WITH CERTAINTY OR A NEGLIGIBLE DIFFERENCE FROM A AND B PICKERS ARE PROBABLY NOT AWARE ABOUT THE DETERMINISM THAT'S IMPLIED IN THIS RIDDLE BY MAKING THE PERFECT PREDICTED BUT

LET'S REALLY MAKE THIS A HARD ONE NOW SHALL WE

YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE AND YOU ARE WALKING FORWARD TO PICK YOUR BOX DURING THAT YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE BOX B ALONE LOOK INTO IT AND THEN YOU CAN DECIDE IF YOU WALK BACK TO TAKE BOX A AS WELL WOULD YOU WALK BACK AND TAKE BOX A

WHEN YOU ARE SITTING THERE LOOKING AT THE BOXES THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO INFLUENCE THE CHOICE THAT THE SIB HAS ALREADY MADE SINCE THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE CASE YOU SHOULD JUST TAKE BOTH AS CHANCES ARE THERE'S ONLY MONEY IN A ANYWAY
AT FIRST GLANCE IT SEEMS COMPLICATED BUT AFTER SOME THOUGHT THE QUESTION IS PRETTY SIMPLE AND UNREMARKABLE IMO ITS BEST TO TAKE BOX B EVERY TIME AND IF THE SIB IS NEAR PERFECT IT WILL ANTICIPATE IT EVERY TIME AND YOU GET EVERY TIME IF YOU ADD THE OTHER BOX INTO THE EQUATION YOU ARE BETTING ON THE SIB NOT ANTICIPATING YOUR CHANGE OF STRATEGY DON'T BET AGAINST SIBS KIDS



TRY THIS THOUGH REVERSE IT IF YOU TAKE BOTH BOXES AND THE SIB ANTICIPATES IT YOU GET NOTHING AND IF YOU TAKE ONLY B AND THE SIB ANTICIPATES IT YOU STILL GET NOTHING TO GET THE YOU HAVE TO CATCH THE SIB OFF GUARD

I'D LIKE TO HEAR THEORIES ON HOW TO SUCCEED IN THIS SITUATION THAT IS HOW DO YOU ELIMINATE THE VARIABLE OF YOUR OWN CHOICE AND CREATE A RANDOM CHOICE OR A CHOICE CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU WOULD CHOOSE THAT CANNOT BE ANTICIPATED YOU CANNOT JUST CHOOSE THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS LOGICAL BECAUSE THE SIB WOULD ANTICIPATE IT
GREAT PROBLEM HERE'S MY TAKE IF YOU PHRASE THE QUESTION AS WOULD YOU RATHER LOSE OR MILLION THE ANSWER BECOMES CLEAR TO ME I WOULD CHOOSE B ALONE IF YOU END UP BEING WRONG YOUR MISTAKE ONLY COSTS YOU THEORETICAL DOLLARS THAT'D BE A LESSON AS TO WHO YOU REALLY ARE IF YOU END UP BEING RIGHT WELL SWEET
FOR ME IT BOILS DOWN TO THE PREMISES IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE TO PREDICT SOMEONE'S CHOICES EVEN IF IT'S ALL CHEMICAL REACTIONS I DON'T THINK THEY'RE PREDICTABLE EVEN IF A THEORETICAL COMPUTER COULD BE CONNECTED TO EACH OF OUR BRAIN CELLS

OTHERWISE WITH THOSE RULES I WOULD FLIP A COIN TO FUCK WITH THE PESKY ALIEN
TO BE HONEST I GET MORE ENTERTAINMENT ABOUT THE ARTICLE ITSELF THAN THE PROBLEM

MEANWHILE I ENCOURAGE FIERCE DEBATE A BOXING MATCH BELOW THE LINE ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF EACH OF THE CHOICES EXPLAIN WHY YOU CHOSE WHAT YOU DID

THIS FORM HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED AND IS CLOSED TO ANY FURTHER SUBMISSIONS

NEVER CHANGE GUARDIAN YOU ARE YOUR OWN JOKE
TAKE BOX A ONLY NOW THE MACHINE IS WRONG
I KNOW PEOPLE CAN CHANGE FUNDAMENTALLY SO I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT IN ADVANCE WHAT ANOTHER PERSON WILL DO

ON THE OTHER HAND I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT TIME IS TRULY LINEAR AND THE FUTURE EVENT CANNOT CHANGE THE PAST AND THE CONTENTS OF THOSE BOXES ARE TRULY PREDETERMINED AT THE TIME WHEN I MAKE MY CHOICE

WHICH DO I CHOOSE WELL EARLIER TODAY I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN JUST B BUT NOW I AM NOT SO SURE THE THING IS THAT I HAVE HEARD THAT PEOPLE WHO WIN THE LOTTERY OFTEN WIND UP UNHAPPY SO MAYBE GETTING THE MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT DESIRABLE AFTER ALL SO I CHOOSE JUST BOX A NOT BOTH BOXES BECAUSE NEED TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND BREAK RULES
THE REASON THIS IS AN ISSUE IS THAT AS WE READ THE PROBLEM WE FIRST DECIDE TO TO TAKE BOTH BOXES ONE HAS THE OTHER EASY I'LL TAKE BOTH THEN WE LEARN ABOUT THE SIB AND WE CHANGE OUR MIND TO ONLY THE B BOX DOES SHE KNOW WHAT MY FIRST CHOICE WAS IF THE SIB NEVER FAILS SHE'D KNOW WHAT I WOULD TAKE SHE KNOWS I'M GOING FOR B
A GOOD WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS WOULD BE TO FLIP A COIN AND HOPE THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING COULDN'T PREDICT COIN FLIPS AND DIDN'T MIND NOVEL SOLUTIONS
I WOULD PICK BOX B JUST TO GET THE CHANCE TO BEST THE MOST PRESCIENT AI IN HISTORY
KNOWING THAT THE SIB HAS BEEN CORRECT IN ITS PREDICTIONS THE CHOICE MUST BE TO TAKE ONLY ONE BOX IF YOUR LOGIC IS TO TAKE BOTH BECAUSE THE MONEY HAS ALREADY BEEN PLACED IN THE BOXES THE SIB WOULD HAVE LIKELY PREDICTED THAT LOGIC AND YOU WOULD ONLY GET THE
I THINK THE KEY HERE IS THAT THE OUTCOME HAS ALREADY BEEN PREDICTED BASED ON YOUR WAY OF THINKING
TO ME THE ANSWER IS B I BELIEVE IN FREE WILL AND THE SIB WOULD KNOW BY PREVIOUS PATTERNS THIS IS TRUE IF I TAKE BOTH I COULD LOSE MILLION LIFE CHANGING MONEY SURE I GAIN BUT FOR THAT I WONDER WHAT IF TO ME IT'S NOT WORTH IT CHOOSE B BECAUSE I HAVE A SHOT AND IF IT WORKS IT WORKS IF IT DOESN'T I CONTINUE ON WITH LIFE THE SAME EXPECT I DON'T HAVE TO WONDER WHAT IF
SOUNDS MORE LIKE A TYPICAL PROBABILITY PROBLEM AND NOT A PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM CAN SOMEONE WORK OUT THE MATH
THE CHOICE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE BETWEEN THE BOX CHOOSING STRATEGIES BUT WHETHER YOU BELIEVE THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION OF THE ALL KNOWING AI THIS SEEMS TO ME LIKE A QUESTION ABOUT FAITH CAN SUCH AN ENTITY EVEN EXIST CAN IT EVEN BE PROVEN TO EXIST ZION IS ALSO THE MATRIX THEORY TO ARGUE ON A UNIVERSALLY OPTIMAL STRATEGY IS ALMOST IRRELEVANT
WHAT IF I BRING ALONG A PERFECT RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR MAYBE SEEDED OFF A QUANTUM FIELD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH EITHER A OR A WITH EQUAL PROBABILITY

IF IT RETURNS I CHOOSE BOTH IF IT RETURNS I CHOOSE B

SO MY DECISION IS TO LEAVE IT PURELY TO CHANCE WHAT DOES THE SIB DO IN THAT CASE IT SEEMS THAT SINCE THE SIB CANNOT PREDICT I WILL CHOOSE B THEN THE SIB WILL PUT THE MILLION DOLLARS IN THERE AND I WIN IN BOTH CASES
HOW IS THIS NOT TRIVIAL THERE IS NO WAY YOU TAKE BOTH BOXES AND WIND UP WITH UNLESS THE DEITY CAN'T REALLY PREDICT YOUR DECISION LIKE IT SAYS IN THE PROBLEM THE FACT THAT THE AMOUNT IN BOX B DOESN'T CHANGE AS YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION IS IRRELEVANT UNLESS YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND AFTER MAKING A DECISION AM I MISSING SOMETHING
MY CURRENT KNOWLEDGE SAYS THAT SUCH A BEING CANNOT EXIST SO I MUST EITHER DECIDE THAT MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS IS FLAWED OR THAT THE SIB ONLY APPEARS TO BE SUPER INTELLIGENT BECAUSE HE HAS GOTTEN LUCKY WITH EVERY ONE OF HIS PREDICTIONS UP TO THIS POINT
TO ME THE QUESTION IS IN ESTABLISHING IF THE SIB IS ALL KNOWING OR SIMPLY PRIVY TO SMALL VARIABLES OUTSIDE THE HUMAN PARADIGM KNOWING THIS DISTINCTION WOULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE EVERYTHING ELSE IS SPECULATION
TAKE BOTH I DON'T BELIEVE ANY SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING PREDICTED ANYTHING AND I NEED MONEY NOW
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE BEFORE OR AFTER YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME DEPENDING ON THE PREDICTION I WOULD THINK THAT IF ANYONE WHERE TO KNOW THAT ALL THEY HAD TO DO TO GET A MILLION DOLLARS WAS CHOOSE ONLY THE B BOX WOULDN'T THEY ALWAYS JUST CHOOSE B
ARF AHMED IS GARBAGE WHAT KIND OF PEDESTRIAN SHITTY EXPLANATION IS THAT
YOU'RE FUCKED THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING HAS SPENT A DECADE BUILDING UP AN IMMUNITY TO COCAINE POWDER
IF IT ALWAYS PREDICTS CORRECTLY THEN YOU SHOULD NEVER TAKE BOTH BECAUSE THAT WILL NEVER GAIN YOU THE MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU TAKE BOTH YOU'LL ALWAYS END UP WITH A THOUSAND BECAUSE IT KNEW YOU'D TAKE BOTH THERE'S NEVER EVER A CHANCE OF A MILLION PLUS A THOUSAND IN THIS GAME SETUP IT'S SUCH A SIMPLE PROBLEM
ISN'T THIS JUST A MONTY HALL PROBLEM
IN WHICH CASE YOU SHOULD PICK B
PHILOSOPHY MEET PROBABILITY
THERE IS ONLY ONE CHOICE THAT GUARANTEES MONEY IN MY POCKET I'D OPT FOR BOTH AND WALK AWAY RICHER
I HATE THIS GAME WHAT IF SIB IS A PERSON WITH ACCURACY DID YOUR CHOICE CHANGED
ONLY TAKE B BECAUSE THE BEFIT OF GAINING THE MILL ISN'T WITH THE RISK OF LOSING A MILITARY
YOUR CHOICE DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE SIB CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE WITH CERTAINTY IF IT CAN THEN YOU MUST TAKE B IF IT CANNOT THEN YOU TAKE BOTH
THIS IS A HILARIOUS EXPERIMENT PROVES HOW DIFFERENTLY WE ALL THINK AND HOW SUBJECTIVE REASON IS
WHAT'S WRONG WITH JUST TAKING BOX A IT'S ENOUGH MONEY FOR ME AND I DON'T REALLY NEED AN EXTRA BOX
I FEEL THAT A BASIS HERE ISN'T ON FREE WILL OR CHOICE BUT THAT MILLION IS THE BEST BEST BEING AN OPINION
2 WHY THE NEED TO TAKE BOTH BOXES TO FIND OUT IF SHE GAVE IT TO ME OR NOT SIMPLICITY TO MUCH GOES WITH BOX B THIS IS JUST HOW I SEE IT
I DON'T SEE WHY PEOPLE WOULDN'T CHOOSE ONLY B IF THE SIB WERE ACCURATE WHILST PREDICTING YOU'D HAVE TO GET THE EVEN IF THE ACCURACY WAS YOU'RE BETTER OFF TAKING B IT ALL DEPENDS ON IF YOU BELIEVE ON PREDICTION
ONE MILLION POUNDS IS ENOUGH FOR ME TRYING TO TAKE THE SECOND JUST MAKES ME GREEDY AND IF SIB WAS WRONG I HAVE NO LESS THAN I CAME WITH AND HAVE PROVED SIB WRONG

SO I WOULD BE PISSED BUT THAT IS SOME CONSOLATION


IDEALLY I WOULD GET TO TALK TO THE SIB IN THAT SITUATION

I DON'T THINK THE OTHER SIDE IS WRONG JUST HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH SILLY TO THINK THERE IS ANY WRONG APPROACH TO THIS
TAKE BOTH AND HERE'S WHY

IT IS ALREADY STATED THAT YOUR TASK IS TO TRY AND WALK AWAY WITH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE RIGHT

THIS LEADS ME TO THE ONLY LOGICAL QUESTION AND THAT IS WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING

FROM THE WAY IT IS WORDED AND BY THE ACTIONS SHE TAKES DEPENDING ON THE CHOICE YOU MAKE I FEEL AS IF IT IS NOT A LEAP IN LOGIC TO DETERMINE THAT THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEINGS GOAL IS TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY

THAT BEING SAID THIS BEING HAS NEVER BEEN WRONG

ASSUMING THE BEINGS GOAL IS CORRECT IT SEEMS TO ME YOU WERE ONLY EVER MEANT TO GET THE CONTENTS OF BOX A SIMPLY BECAUSE IT MEANT GIVING YOU LESS

SO TAKE BOTH IN THE VERY IMPROBABLE CHANCE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS BEING IS WRONG SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH THE CONTENTS OF BOX A ANYWAYS

YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE

BECAUSE THIS BEING NEVER ACTUALLY NEEDED TO MAKE A PREDICTION THIS BEING IS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO KNOW YOUR GOAL WAS TO GET AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

SO TAKE BOTH JUST IN CASE

I THINK ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT WHILE YOUR GOAL IS OBTAIN THE MOST MONEY THE SIB GOAL IS TO BE CORRECT

SO I WOULD GUESS THAT THE SIB IS GOING TO NATURALLY BET ON THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT LOSING ANYTHING BY TAKING BOTH BUT IF YOUR GOAL WAS ALSO TO PROVE FREE WILL AND CHOICE AND TO ULTIMATELY PROVE THE SIB WRONG THEN WOULDN'T YOU JUST TAKE B EVERY TIME
EPHAH I'LL JUST TAKE BOTH AND IF MY MONEY ISN'T IN THERE I'LL GET OVER IT ORR I MIGHT BE APATHETIC ENOUGH TO WALK AWAY FROM THE ENTIRE SITUATION BECAUSE WHO T GIVES OUT MONEY LIKE THAT ANYWAYS REALISTICALLY SPEAKING
THIS REMINDS ME OF SOMETHING MY FRIEND USED TO SAY WHENEVER WE PLAYED CARDS AND I MESSED UP THE ORDER I DEALT OUT THE CARDS IN SHE WOULD SAY OH NO YOU CHANGED FATE I WAS DESTINED TO HAVE THAT CARD THIS WOULD ALWAYS FRUSTRATE ME AND IN THE SAME WAY THIS PROBLEM DOES BECAUSE DESTINY IS A FUTURE YOU CANNOT CHANGE WHATEVER CARD SHE GOT WAS THE CARD SHE WAS DESTINED TO HAVE AND SO IF THE SIB CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE WITHOUT FAIL IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND OR FLIP A COIN BECAUSE THE SIB WILL HAVE ALREADY PREDICTED THAT ENTIRE PROCESS FROM START TO FINISH TAKING BOX B IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
MY ANSWER IS THAT I WOULD USE A MAXIMALLY RANDOM SYSTEM LIKELY BASED ON RADIOACTIVE DECAY TO OUTPUT AN INDETERMINATE ANSWER AND GO WITH WHICHEVER ONE IT GIVES ME
I FEEL LIKE THE ANSWER TO THIS IS PRETTY CLEARLY B ONLY IMAGINE THAT INSTEAD OF A PERSON FACING THIS TEST WE WERE OBSERVING THE EXECUTION PROCESS OF A COMPUTER PROGRAM THE PROGRAM READS IN A RANDOM NUMBER BETWEEN TO THAT RANDOM NUMBER WILL BE USED AS PART OF A LONG CALCULATION IF THE RESULT OF THE LONG CALCULATION IS OVER THEN IT SHOULD DO ONE THING IF IT IS UNDER THAT IT SHOULD DO ANOTHER THING NOW IMAGINE THAT BEFORE THAT LONG CALCULATION RUNS THE PROGRAM RUNS ANOTHER FASTER CALCULATION WHICH WILL GIVE THE SAME ANSWER AS THE LONG CALCULATION AT THAT POINT EVEN THOUGH THE LONG CALCULATION HAS NOT HAPPENED NOT ONLY IS THE ANSWER OF THAT LONG CALCULATION ALREADY DETERMINED BECAUSE THERE WILL ONLY EVER BE RESULT FROM PERFORMING THE CALCULATION BUT THE ANSWER IS ALSO KNOWN BY THE PROGRAM EXECUTION FROM THE SHORTER CALCULATION EVEN THOUGH THE PERSON MAY NOT PERSONALLY REALIZE WHICH BOX THEY WILL SELECT IT IS ALREADY A FORGONE CONCLUSION THEY CAN NO SOONER CHANGE THEIR CHOICE THAN THE RANDOM VALUE STORED COULD SOMEHOW MODIFY ITSELF BETWEEN THE SHORT AND LONG CALCULATIONS FORGET ABOUT UNCERTAINTY AND TIME COMPLETELY THEY HAVE NO BEARING ON THE RESULT THIS IS SIMPLY A QUESTION THAT IS ASKING IF YOU WOULD RATHER BE SOMEONE WHO CHOSE BOTH BOXES OR SOMEONE WHO CHOSE ONLY B TO WHICH THE ANSWER IS PRETTY CLEAR PEOPLE WHO ONLY CHOSE ONLY B GET MORE MONEY THAN PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE BOTH SO THE CORRECT ANSWER IS THAT YOU WOULD RATHER BE SOMEONE WHO ONLY CHOSE B
FUCK TEAM BOTH MY INSTINCT WAS TO TAKE B FROM THE AND ACCORDING TO WHAT I READ IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THAT MAKES ME RICHER
JUST TAKE B SURE YOU'RE NEEDLESSLY LOSING OUT A GRAND BUT IF THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING WAS WRONG YOU'LL BE FAMOUS AND YOU CAN WRITE A BOOK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE THE TRUE GENIUS
YOUR AIM IS TO GET THE MOST MONEY

I FEEL LIKE THAT IS THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM IT ASSUMES MY LOGIC WOULD BE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED BY GREED

WHAT IF MY AIM IS TO GET MOST OF THE MONEY THAT BEING THE MILLION
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MOST MONEY AND MOST OF THE MONEY HERE IS A MERE THE HYPOTHETICAL SIB WOULD SURELY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT I'M NOT SWAYED ENOUGH BY GREED TO TAKE MY CHANCES AND GO FOR ALL AND INSTEAD WOULD QUICKLY SETTLE ON BOX B
TAKE BOTH GET MONEY
THIS MIGHT BE CHEATING BUT MY INITIAL REACTION TO THE PROBLEM WAS TO FLIP A COIN FOR THE DECISION AND FOLLOW IT THROUGH OF COURSE ASSUMING HERE THAT THE BEING IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO PREDICT COIN FLIPS WAY AHEAD OF TIME THEY'D NEED SOMETHING BEYOND INTELLIGENCE TO DO THAT I FEEL

EVEN IF THE BEING CAN GUESS THAT I'M THE KIND OF PERSON TO FLIP FOR IT THEY STILL CAN'T GUESS WHAT THE DECISION WILL BE I WONDER WHAT THEY WOULD DO
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME WHY THIS QUESTION CAUSES SO MUCH DISCUSSION AND SELF ASSUREDNESS ELSEWHERE IN THIS THREAD I'D NEVER GOTTEN SO MANY REPLIES TO SUCH A MUNDANE COMMENT

I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN FOOL THE SIB OR OPERATE AT A LEVEL ABOVE IT IT CHALLENGES ONES CONCEPTION ON FREE WILLIAM AND BELIEVING ONE HAS IT AND TO WHAT DEGREE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE INDEED
THE DECISION WAS ALREADY MADE YOU KNOW A HAS MONEY YOU CAN TAKE ONE OR BOTH TAKE BOTH AND YOU'RE GUARANTEED AND MAY GET
WONDERFULLY LIKELY INTENTIONALLY HORRIBLE WAY TO PUT PHILOSOPHY INTO TWO SEEMING OPPOSING FUNCTIONS AND LIMIT ALL MANNER OF CONTEXT AND TO GET A OUTCOME
SARTRE WOULD SAY YOU WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE WITHOUT TAKING ANY BOXES BECAUSE YOUR ESSENCE WILL NOT BE PIGEON HOLED INTO BOX PICKING OR PROFIT MOTIVE FOR THE PLEASURE OF SOME SUPREME DIETY

PICKING A BOX IS BAD FAITH RIGHT
EASY TAKE BOTH BOXES IF YOU ARE WRONG THEN THAT SUPER SMART ALIEN IS DUMB
I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THIS ONE BOX OR TWO BOXES PROBLEM WOULD JUST BE DISCUSSING THE BOX THAT WAS IN THE PICTURE OF THE ARTICLE THAT HAD A LID SOMETHING LIKE IS IT JUST ONE BOX IF IT REQUIRES A PART TO BE COMPLETE THE LID OR TWO DISTINCT PIECES IE AT WHAT POINT CAN YOU CONSIDER SOMETHING A WHOLE SORT OF LIKE THAT BOAT PARADOX WHERE YOU KEEP REPLACING ALL THE PARTS IN THE BOAT UNTIL YOUVE REPLACED EVERY SINGLE PART IS IT THE SAME BOAT OR SOMETHING NEW ANYWAYS ID TAKE THE SIB AND THE BOXES TAKE THE CASH HAIL A CAB AND BUY A NEW PASSPORT THEN SELL THAT DEVIL MACHINERY ON THE BLACK MARKET TO PEOPLE INVESTING IN STOCKS OR SOME SHIT
THIS PROBLEM SMACKS OF THE PREDESTINATION AND SALVATION PARADOXES IN CHRISTIANITY THE IDEA THAT GOD ALREADY PREDESTINED THE ELECT TO BE SAVED AND HE KNEW HIS ELECT WOULD CHOOSE CHRISTIANITY SO IF YOU LIVE A SINFUL LIFE YOU WERE DOOMED ANYWAY IT'S THE SAME PROBLEM REALLY EXCEPT CHOOSING ONLY BOX B IS CHOOSING CHRISTIANITY AND CHOOSING BOTH BOXES IS CHOOSING SIN GOD STANDS IN FOR THE BEING
THE PEOPLE WHO SAY TAKING TWO BOXES IS CORRECT ARE MISTAKEN KNOWING WHAT WILL HAPPEN BEFORE HAND PREDETERMINED
YOU GET TO CHOOSE A BIG ICE-CREAM OR A LITTLE ICE-CREAM

IF YOU CHOOSE THE BIG ICE-CREAM YOU WILL GET A BIG ICE-CREAM BECAUSE GOD LOVES YOU

IF YOU CHOOSE THE SMALL ICE-CREAM YOU GET A SMALL ICE-CREAM BECAUSE GOD HATES YOU

PROBLEM SUCKS BALLS
MY TAKE ON PROBLEM

LET'S FORGET A LOT OF THE COMPLEX ELEMENTS WHICH MAKE THIS A MESSY PROBLEM THE DATE IS TODAY THE TECHNOLOGY IS TECH CAUSALITY ONLY GOES FORWARD PROPHECY IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT BASIC PREDICTIVE POWER AS IS UNDERSTOOD BY STATISTICS HOLDS

2 FOR A MOMENT CONSIDER AN EVEN EASIER PROBLEM YOU KNOW WHAT THE ALGORITHM IS THE ALGORITHM SORTS PEOPLE BY HEIGHT TALL PEOPLE ARE OVERCONFIDENT AND AS SUCH TAKE BOTH WHILE SHORTER PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO JUST TAKE BOX B IN THIS DOUBLY SIMPLIFIED CASE WHAT IS THE CORRECT CHOICE BOTH OR BOX B THE ANSWER IS NEITHER THE CORRECT ANSWER IS TO CONVINCE THE COMPUTER THAT YOU ARE SHORT PERHAPS BY INTENTIONALLY LYING ON A FORM AS LONG AS THE COMPUTER SORTS YOU INTO THE PUT IN THE B BOX GROUP IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT YOU PICK THOUGH IT MAKES SENSE TO GRAB BOTH WHILE YOUR THERE

CONSIDER AN IMPROVED VERSION OF THE ABOVE ALGORITHM IT ACCOUNTS FOR MANY FACTORS AGE EDUCATION YOUR INTERNET HISTORY ETC IN MAKING ITS DETERMINATION WOULD IT BE LOGICAL TO PURCHASE A FAKE PASSPORT FOR IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPUTER SORTED YOU INTO THE B BOX GROUP THUS GUARANTEEING THE BY CONVINCING THE COMPUTER YOU WERE THE RIGHT AGE EDUCATION ETC THERE ARE MORAL ISSUES HERE BUT STRICTLY ECONOMICALLY IT MAKES SENSE

BASED ON THREE IT MAKES SENSE TO FORGO BOX A AND ONLY PICK BOX B IF THE ALGORITHM INSISTED IN A SIMILAR CASE YOU COULD GO TO AN ENGINEER AND TELL THEM TO TWEAK THE ALGORITHM TO GUARANTEE YOU THE MILLION YOU WILL LEAVE BOX A AND THEY CAN TAKE IT THEMSELVES LATER AS A BRIBE

CONSIDER A NEARLY UNBREAKABLE VERSION OF THE ALGORITHM IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE PERFECT PREDICTION IS FINE JUST UNCHECKABLE UNTINKERABLE UNFOOLABLE YOU CANNOT TRICK THE COMPUTER INTO BELIEVING SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF THAT IS FALSE IF YOU CANNOT TRICK THE COMPUTER YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE YOURSELF CHANGE YOUR AGE THE OLD FASHIONED WAY BY GETTING OLDER MAYBE GET A DEGREE IF THAT IMPROVES YOUR ODDS ETC

RETURNING TO THE ORIGINAL NEWCOMB PROBLEM WHAT IS THE CHEAPEST FASTEST WAY TO CONVINCE THE COMPUTER TO SORT YOU INTO THE BOX B GROUP ASSUMING THAT THE COMPUTER IS DECENT AT SORTING PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY BE A BOX B PERSON BEING A BOX B KINDA GUY IS MOST LIKELY TO GET YOUR SORTED INTO THE BOX B GROUP AND BEST PART IT ONLY COSTS WHICH IS POTENTIALLY MUCH CHEAPER THAN ANY POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL SHENANIGANS AND WITH LESS MORAL FALLOUT

ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LINE OF THOUGHT
THAT WHICH IS GOOD IN THE IS BEST IN THE SHORT-RUN

2 IN THE LONG RUN ALWAYS CHOOSING BOX B IS BEST FOR BOTH PARTIES

YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE MONEY THE COMPUTER WANTS TO MAXIMIZE ACCURACY BY REPEATEDLY ONLY TAKING B THE COMPUTER IS MAXIMIZED AND YOU ARE NEARLY MAXIMIZED ANY OTHER COURSE OF ACTION DRASTICALLY LOSES YOU MONEY AND THE COMPUTER ACCURACY

IF IN THE LONG RUN BOX B IS BEST IN THE SHORT RUN BOX B IS BEST
TAKE B ONLY LET HER PREDICT YOU WILL TAKE B ONLY


LOSE THE GAME BUT GET A MILLION DOLLARS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME
I HAVE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO CHOICES ESPECIALLY ONCE I STARTED READING THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE THREADS ONE THING I SEEM TO HAVE PICKED UP IS THAT SOMEHOW WE SHOULD BE DOUBTING THE PREDICTION SKILLS OF THE SIB SINCE WE ARE TOLD THAT SHE IS VERY GOOD AT IT I WOULD SIMPLY DISMISS THE ARGUMENT THAT SHE COULD BE WRONG IF I WAS BUYING A LOTTERY AND YOU SOMEONE WHO HAS APPARENTLY TOLD PEOPLE WHICH LOTTERY TO BUY AND SUCCESSFULLY GOT THEM EACH TIME SO FAR TOLD ME TO PICK LOTTERY A INSTEAD OF LOTTERY B I WOULD SIMPLY FOLLOW YOUR INSTRUCTIONS SINCE THE ALTERNATIVE IS ME GUESSING RANDOMLY I COULD POTENTIALLY BUY A LOTTERY THAT ENDS UP GETTING ME BUT I WILL NOT RISK YOUR DECENT SKILL OF GETTING PEOPLE FOR IT SINCE AGAIN I'M LOOKING AT MUCH SMALLER CHANCES SO SIMILARLY SINCE ACCEPTING THAT THE SIB HAS MORE POTENTIAL TO MAKE YOU RICHER WE SHOULD ACCEPT HER SKILLS AS PERFECT

UNDER THIS ASSUMPTION THE NEXT THING I FOUND INTERESTING IS THE NATURE OF THE PREDICTION SINCE WE ARE BLACK-BODING HOW IT IS ACTUALLY PREDICTED BUT KNOW THAT IT IS NONETHELESS ACCURATE WE ARE LEFT TO ASSUME THAT THE PREDICTION IS MADE BEFORE WE HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION WHAT DOES IT ACTUALLY MEAN TO BE A BOTH OR PERSON IF I DON'T KNOW THIS SITUATION IF SOMEONE ASKED YOU THIS QUESTION RANDOMLY IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR YOU TO STRONGLY CHOOSE TO BE EITHER BOTH OR BUT SINCE THE SIB SOMEHOW KNOWS WHICH ONE YOU ARE AND SETS THE MONEY AMOUNT ACCORDING TO THE RULES WHAT YOU DECIDE AFTER THE RULES ARE EXPLAINED DOES NOT MATTER AFTER THE RULES ARE EXPLAINED ALL YOU ARE CAPABLE OF DOING IS PROVING THE PREDICTION WHICH WE HAVE GRANTED TO BE ACCURATE THERE IS NO LINK BETWEEN CHOICE AND THE PREDICTION THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN YOUR STATE OF BOTH OR PRE-EXPLANATION BUT SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PREFERENCE FOR EITHER ONE AT THIS STAGE YOU DO NOT INFLUENCE THE PREDICTION AGAIN HOW THE SIB KNOWS BEFORE EVEN I KNOW IS BLACK BOXED

THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING IS ALWAYS RIGHT DR ARF AHMED

THIS IS A GENERALIZATION OF THE PROBLEM AS STATED BUT SURE I'LL TAKE IT

YOU CANNOT INFLUENCE A DECISION MADE IN THE PAST BY A DECISION MADE IN THE PRESENT DR DAVID EDMONDS

ACTUALLY SEEMINGLY WRONG ACCORDING TO A STUDY HETP BY DR DARYL BEM OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY WHAT PEOPLE LEARN IN THE FUTURE SEEMS TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THEIR PRESENT DECISIONS TO QUOTE AN NPR ARTICLE ON THE SUBJECT

LATER TODAY YOU ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT YET
YET SOMEHOW IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED SOMEHOW IT'S ALREADY AFFECTED YOU

BUT ACCORDING TO THE SAME ARTICLE ONE ATTEMPT TO DUPLICATE THE WORK HAS ALREADY FAILED SO IN CONCLUSION WHILE AS A CONCEPT I AGREE WITH DR AHMED I DISLIKE BOTH HIS AND DR EDMONDS EXPLANATIONS
HUH

PICKING BOTH BOXES EITHER GIVES YOU OR

PICKING THE ONE GIVES YOU OR


LEICESTER ARE HAVING AN AWFUL CAMPAIGN ODDS ON THEM REPEATING AS CHAMPS ARE LOW
I WOULD THANK THE BEING SAYING SHE COULD HAVE THE BOXES
THIS WRITEUP ISN'T EMPHASIZING IT PROPERLY THE PREDICTOR HERE IS NEVER WRONG INFALLIBLE

IT HAS PREDICTED WHAT YOU ARE CORRECTLY

IF YOU PICK THE ONE YOU GET
IF YOU PICK BOTH YOU GET

THE AND ARE NOT POSSIBLE
I DON'T WANT TO OPEN EITHER BOX
AS YOU CANT INFLUENCE WHO YOU ARE TO THE SIB TAKING BOTH BOXED WILL ALWAYS BE MOST BENEFICIAL

MEANING EVEN A B PERSON IS MORE BENEFITED BY TAKING BOTH BOXES AND A BOTH PERSON LOOSES NOTHING BY TAKING BOTH
ONLY A FOOL RESPONDS TO HYPOTHETICALS

IT'S LIKE ASKING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE MEETS AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TAKING BOTH ALWAYS YIELDS THE OPTIMUM RESULT ONCE THE CHOICE HAS BEEN MADE WHETHER OR NOT MILLION IS IN BOX OR NOT IT IS WRITTEN IN STONE

IF THERE IS ZERO IN THE BOX PICKING BOTH YIELDS YOU IF YOU PICK BOX YOU WOULD YIELD

IF THERE IS MILLION IN THE BOX PICKING BOTH WOULD YIELD AND PICKING ONE YIELDS

THE OPTIMUM MOVE IS ALWAYS TO CHOOSE BOTH ONCE THE DECISION IS ALREADY BEEN MADE
YOU SHOULD LITERALLY JUST DO WHICHEVER YOU THINK IS RIGHT AND THAT WILL GET YOU THE MOST MONEY ASSUMING THE BEING IS ALWAYS RIGHT

BOTH BOXES PEOPLE JUST TAKE BOTH BECAUSE THE BEING ALREADY KNEW YOU WOULD COME AWAY WITH

B ONLY PEOPLE JUST TAKE B BECAUSE YOU PLAY SAFE AND THE BEING KNEW THIS

IF THE B ONLY PERSON STARTS TO THINK WELL I WOULD NORMALLY PLAY IT SAFE SO THE BEING PROBABLY THINKS I WOULD ONLY TAKE ONE BOX I'M GOING TO TAKE BOTH THEN THEY WERE NEVER REALLY A B PERSON TO START WITH THE BEING KNOWS THIS
WHY IS THIS QUESTION SO CONTROVERSIAL IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU PICK BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO WIN ANYWAYS THE SUPER BEING ALREADY KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE
THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO CHEAT BUT ONLY IF YOU WERE TO ASSUME THERE WAS A POINT TO HOW MUCH YOU END WITH TO HAVE WOULD MEAN THAT YOU ULTIMATELY WON AND BEAT IT'S PREDICTION THATS WHAT I ASSUME WOULD BE THE ABSOLUTE BEST OUTCOME THIS DICTATES THAT WINNING ULTIMATELY MEANS BEATING THE PREDICTION IN ORDER TO FOOL IT INTO GIVING YOU THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT THE ONLY WAY TO WIN AN UNFINABLE GAME IS TO PLAY BY RULES THAT MAKE YOU WIN CHEAT OF COURSE THIS IS ONLY IF YOU ASSUME THERE IS A POINT EMPTY BOX A INTO BOX B AND LEAVE WITH ONLY BOX B

THIS BRINGS ME TO THE NEXT POINT WHAT DOES A WIN MEAN AND WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO WIN

ASSUMING THE RULES ARE STILL SOLID ITS JUST MATHEMATICS AND THERE IS NO REASON TO ASSUME THAT SIB IS GOING TO GET IT WRONG ITS TRACK RECORD IS PERFECT THIS IS ALL ONLY ASSUMING THAT LEAVING WITH THE MONEY MEANS THAT YOU GET TO KEEP IT SO YOU HAVE INCENTIVE TO CHOOSE THE LOGICAL OPTION WITH THE LARGEST RETURN AND THAT WOULD BE THE ASSOCIATION OF A WIN NOW MAYBE YOU DONT NEED IT AND JUST CHOOSE BOTH BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE IF ITS WRONG AND FIGHT THE ODDS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE SIB IS NOT STATED TO BE OMNIPOTENT IS STILL THE MOST YOU COULD GET IF YOU CHOOSE BOTH AND ITS RIGHT SO YOU TECHNICALLY DIDN'T LOSE IF IT WAS WRONG AND YOU WERE RIGHT YOU GOT THE LARGEST AMOUNT POSSIBLE CHOOSING THE HIGHEST RETURN POSSIBLE SUPPOSE YOU CHOSE THE HIGHEST RETURN LOWEST RISK OPTION OF B AND THE SIB IS WRONG YOUR INTENTION ALIGNED WITH THE PREMISE WOULD MEAN THAT YOU PICKED THE RIGHT ANSWER BUT THE OUTCOME IS ULTIMATELY

I STILL HOLD STRONG THAT YOUR BEST CHOICE IS TO CHEAT BUT IF IS THE LARGEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT YOU CAN GET GIVEN THE FARTHEST OUTLIERS AND BEST CHOICE THE REAL QUESTION WOULD BE WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU WON OR IF PICKING BOTH AND THE SIB MAKING A MISTAKE WOULD MEAN A WIN




SO TAKE BOX B OPEN IT SEE IF IT HAS A MILLION IT DOESN'T SAY YOU CAN'T GO BACK AND TAKE THE OTHER BOX ONCE YOU OPEN THE FIRST DOES IT I DIDN'T READ INTO THE WHOLE PARADOX BUT THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE UNACCOUNTED FOR IF YOU TAKE B AND IT'S EMPTY THEN WHAT IF YOU DECIDE THE GAME WAS RIGGED FROM THE START AND WALK AWAY WITHOUT ANY MONEY OR IF YOU ONLY TAKE BOX A BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT HAS A GUARANTEED INSTEAD OF A POSSIBILITY AT

IF I WERE PUT INTO THE SCENARIO I WOULD TAKE B AND OPEN IT ON THE SPOT IF EMPTY THEN IT WAS AS THOUGH MY FUTURE WAS DECIDED PRIOR TO ME OPENING THE BOX IF IT HAD A MILLION I MIGHT AS WELL ALSO TAKE BOX A AND HAVE ANOTHER
I WOULD BET A FRIEND THAT THE INFALLIBLE PREDICTOR WOULD FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER FAIL TO PREDICT MY CHOICE SUCCESS RATE MAKES IT A SMART BET FOR MY FRIEND THEN I CHOOSE B IF SIB IS RIGHT I GET AND MY FRIEND GETS IF SIB IS WRONG THEN I STILL GET AND ITD BE MY FRIEND'S BAD LUCK TO HAVE LOST A BET ON A SURE THING
THIS HYPOTHETICAL SETUP CLEARLY YIELDS A CONTRADICTION IN ANOTHER CONTEXT THIS WOULD BE A PROOF BY CONTRADICTION OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN SIB
THE ALIEN REALLY WANTS TO GIVE YOU A MILLION BUCKINGHAMSHIRE

DON'T BE A GREEDY FUCKER TAKE THAT COOL MILLION
STRIKES ME AS JUST OBVIOUSLY RIGHT ESPECIALLY GIVEN SUCH A COLOSSAL DISCREPANCY IN REWARDS TIMES AS MUCH IN BOX B

ONE POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT MIGHT BE TO USE A QUANTUM RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR TO MAKE YOUR DECISION FOR YOU WEIGHTING AT AND AT IF THE PREDICTOR KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO FILL BOTH BOXES BECAUSE IT KNOWS THERE'S A CHANCE OF YOU SO YOU GUARANTEE YOURSELF THE BIG REWARD AND GET A CHANCE OF THE SMALL REWARD TOO THIS WOULD OF COURSE BREAK DOWN IF THE RECORD INCLUDED A LARGE SAMPLE OF PEOPLE WHO HAD ALREADY DONE THIS AND IT STILL GOT THEM RIGHT YOU'D HAVE TO ASSUME THAN THAT THE PREDICTOR KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT QUANTUM RANDOMNESS THAT YOU DON'T BUT EVEN IF THAT WEREN'T SO I'D PROBABLY ONLY TAKE THE RISK IF THE DISCREPANCY IN THE VALUES WERE MUCH SMALLER TO IS SO HUGE THAT IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO JUST USE THE SAFE APPROACH

I'VE YET TO SEE ANY REMOTELY CONVINCING ARGUMENT THAT EVERY TIME IS JUSTIFIED
THE CHOICE BETWEEN BOXES IS A COMPLETE RED HERRING EITHER THE SIB CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE OR NOT YOU ARE GIVEN THE PREMISE THAT IT CAN AND YOU MUST DECIDE WHETHER TO BELIEVE IT

WHETHER YOU CHOOSE ONE BOX OR TWO ONLY FOLLOWS THE PRIOR DECISION IF YOU BELIEVE THE FUTURE CAN BE PREDICTED BY SIB ONCE AGAIN YOU PICK ONE BOX IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT YOU TAKE BOTH WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLEX ABOUT THIS

PERSONALLY I FIND THE TWO BOXES CAMP A BIT PARANOID MYSELF NOT BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T BE RIGHT BUT BECAUSE THEY IMAGINE A WORLD IN WHICH SOMEONE LAYS OUT A CLEAR LOGICAL PUZZLE THEN FLIPS THE PUZZLE ON ITS HEAD BY SAYING WELL CONGRATS YOU WERE THE ONE TIME THE SIB FUCKED UP SO NOW YOU GET M INSTEAD OF OR YOU GET BUT THEY'RE ALSO SAYING THAT RATHER THAN MERELY REFUSING TO PLACE YOUR FAITH IN THE SIB YOU MUST COMPLETELY CHALLENGE THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF ITS PREDICTIVE ABILITY DESPITE WHAT IS LAID OUT BEFORE YOU IN THE PROBLEM

SURE YOU COULD CHOOSE TO BE THAT CONSERVATIVE BUT THAT'S LIKE MORPHEUS TELLING YOU TO TAKE THE RED OR BLUE PILL AND INSTEAD CHECKING ALL HIS POCKETS FOR THE GREEN PILL IT JUST IMPLIES ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES AND KIND OF IGNORES THE PROBLEM AS A WHOLE EQUALLY VALID IS TO NEVER DECIDE ON THE BOX FIND THE SIB ENSLAVE IT AND MAKE MILLIONS TAKING ITS PARLOUR TRICKS ON THE ROAD SURE IT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT IF SOMEONE LAYS OUT A PROBLEM WORK WITH WHAT YOU HAVE

TL R PHILOSOPHERS THINK THEY'RE SMART BECAUSE THEY OVERTHINK SHIT PICK BOX AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE SECOND ARGUMENT TAKE BOTH BOXES FUNDAMENTALLY VIOLATES THE GIVEN ASSUMPTION IN THE PROBLEM STATEMENT


GIVEN STATEMENT BEING HAS NEVER MADE A BAD PREDICTION SIB CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE


ARGUMENT 2 STATEMENT YOU CANNOT INFLUENCE A DECISION MADE IN THE PAST BY A DECISION MADE IN THE PRESENT SIB CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE


IF WE ARE TO ASSUME THAT THE SIB IS ALWAYS RIGHT THEN THE CONCEPTS OF PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE ARE ALL MEANINGLESS SINCE ARGUMENT 2 RELIES HEAVILY ON CONCEPTS THAT ARE VOIDED BY THE GIVEN STATEMENT ARGUMENT 2 FALLS APART THIS ARTICLE STATES THAT THE WORLD OF PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN SPLIT INTO TWO OPPOSING CAMPS I HAVE YET TO SEE A SINGLE PERSON HERE ARGUE FOR TAKING BOTH BOXES


EDIT FORMATTING



THE ENTITY DO NOT JUST FORESEE THE FUTURE IT CHANGE IT SO NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO IT ALREADY DECIDED WHAT IS THE OUTCOME I CHOOSE THE ONLY OPTIONAL THAT IS REALLY A CHOICE I TAKE NONE OF THEM FOR I AM A FREE MANUAL
I READ MOST BUT NOT ALL OF THE COMMENTS AND I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE WHO ACTUALLY EXPRESSED THE PROBLEM QUITE CORRECTLY TO MY MIND

SIB IS VERY GOOD AT PREDICTING NOT OMNISCIENT SHE EVALUATES ME AND THEN SETS UP THE BOXES THE TWO BOXES TOGETHER CONTAIN EITHER ONE MILLION AND ONE THOUSAND POUNDS OR JUST A THOUSAND POUNDS NOTHING I DO NOW WILL CHANGE WHAT IS IN THOSE BOXES I CAN NOT GO WRONG BY CHOOSING BOTH

AND YET THE SIB IS REALLY GOOD AT PREDICTING SHE HAD TO HAVE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE LOGIC JUST GIVEN ALONG WITH MUCH ELSE I SHOULD ASSUME THAT SHE WILL HAVE CONSIDERED EVERY POSSIBILITY I DO AND MANY MORE BESIDES IF I AM THE SORT OF PERSON WHO WOULD REASON TO THIS POINT AND CONCLUDE THAT THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION IS TO TAKE BOTH BOXES SHE WILL HAVE PREDICTED THAT IT IS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE AFTER ALL

THEREFORE I MIGHT REASON FURTHER TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO BE THE SORT OF PERSON WHO THE SIB WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO TAKE ONLY BOX B WOULD BE TO IN FACT PICK ONLY BOX B DOING SO I CAN HAVE HIGH CONFIDENCE OF WINNING THE MILLION WHAT DOES THE EXTRA THOUSAND MATTER

BUT AGAIN HAVING COME THIS FAR BEING THE SORT OF PERSON WHO COULD REASON SO WELL AS TO OBTAIN THE MILLION THERE IS NO REASON I CAN'T OUTSMART THE SIB AND PICK UP THE EXTRA THOUSAND RIGHT IN FACT IT WOULD BE IRRATIONAL TO TAKE ONLY BOX B LITERALLY LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE FOR NO REASON IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN CHANGE HER PREDICTION BY ANYTHING I DO
SOLUTION IF REALITY IS SUFFICIENTLY DETERMINISTIC THEN CHOOSE BOX B

IF REALITY IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DETERMINISTIC THEN CHOOSE SOME MIXTURE OF BOTH AND B CHOOSE B WITH PROBABILITY IF SHE WANTS TO PUNISH YOU FOR TRICKING HERALDRY AND CHOOSE B WITH PROBABILITY EPSILON IF SHE ONLY CARES ABOUT MAXIMIZING HER SUCCESS RATE
ARE THE BOXES NOT IRRELEVANT THERE IS EITHER OR ON THE TABLE PICKING ONLY BOX B IS ALWAYS A LOSS I DON'T UNDERSTAND B PERSON LOGIC THE SIB PREDICTION HAS ALREADY OCCURRED THERE IS NO MIND TRICK THAT WILL ALTER THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF IN BOX B THE PERFECTION OF THE SIB IS IRRELEVANT IT HAS MADE ITS CHOICE
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ENCOUNTERING THIS PARADOX SO MAYBE I AM BEING HASTY IN MY CONCLUSION I ALSO WORKED AS A PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO MAYBE I AM MISTAKENLY REDUCING THIS TO THE SIMPLEST OF TABLE GAMES
I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT IF I SAW FIVE PEOPLE PLAY THIS GAME BEFORE ME EACH OF THEM PICKING ONLY BOX B AND ALL OF THEM BECOMING RICHER UPON MY TURN AS THE SIXTH PERSON TO GO I WOULD STILL PICK BOTH BOXES IF I ONLY BECAME RICHER I WOULD BE CONTENT AND AT PEACE WITH MY CHOICE
MOST OF THE ANALYSES HERE ASSUMING THAT WE MONEY VALUE LINEARLY WHICH EMPIRICALLY IS NOT TRUE

FOR SOME PEOPLE WILL PAY RENT FOR MONTHS POSSIBLY LESS IF THEY LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO OR SOMETHING AND THEY DESPERATELY NEED TO PAY RENT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RISK GETTING NOTHING WHEN THEY CAN GRAB BOTH BOXES AND BE GUARANTEED MONTHS OF RENT

FOR OTHER PEOPLE IS LIKE DAY ON THE STOCK MARKET THEY GAIN AND LOSE THAT KIND OF MONEY ALL THE TIME AND IT DOESN'T PHASE THEM GIVING UP A GUARANTEED FOR A CHANCE AT MIL IS A NO BRAINER FOR THEM THEY'LL TAKE JUST BOX B
THIS IS AN OBFUSCATION OF THE ARGUMENT MPH
BUT HOW CAN YOUR DECISION AT THAT MOMENT CHANGE WHAT IS ALREADY ON THE TABLE
LET ME PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE VERSION OF THE PROBLEM THE SIB OFFERS YOU THE SAME BASIC CHOICE BUT SAYS IF YOU CHOOSE BOTH BOXES I WILL GO BACK IN TIME AND REMOVE THE FROM BOX B YOU MAY THINK I'M GOING TOO FAR BY INTRODUCING TIME TRAVEL WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE IN OUR UNIVERSE BUT I'D ARGUE THAT INTRODUCING TIME TRAVEL IS NO DIFFERENT THAN INTRODUCING AN INFALLIBLE PREDICTOR WHICH IS THE SAME AS INTRODUCING RETROCAUSALITY IF YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK THE LAWS OF PHYSICS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT FORM YOU DO IT IN EXCEPT THAT SOME FORMS MAY MAKE THE PARADOX SEEM MORE BAFFLING THAN OTHERS WOULD NOW IF THE SIB IS INFALLIBLE AND I AGREE THAT THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM DOES NOT EXPLICITLY SAY SHE IS INFALLIBLE THEN IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF STATISTICS GAME THEORY AND IS FAR LESS INTERESTING
SO THE SIB CAN CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THE BOXES BECAUSE IF SHE CAN'T YOU OBVIOUSLY SHOULD ALWAYS PICK BOTH

IF THEY CAN WELL THAT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MATTER
WHAT IF YOU DECIDE TO FLIP A COIN IN YOUR POCKET AND IF IT IS HEADS YOU PICK BOTH IF TAILS YOU PICK B WOULD THE SIB HUNT YOU DOWN FOR KILLING HER TRACK RECORD
DELETED
LET'S SUPPOSE THAT YOU TAKE JUST BOX B WHAT DO YOU GET

IF THE PREDICTOR WAS ACTUALLY FLIPPING A COIN AND WAS JUST ABSURDLY LUCKY BEFORE THEN THERE IS A CHANCE THAT SHE FILLED THE BOX EXPECTED VALUE

IF THE PREDICTOR IS GENUINELY TAKING YOUR PERSONALITY INTO ACCOUNT IN SOME WAY MAYBE BY EXAMINING YOUR PAST CHOICES THEN LET'S SAY SHE COULD PREDICT YOUR ACTIONS WITH ACCURACY SO THERE'S A CHANCE THAT SHE CORRECTLY GUESSED YOU WOULD TAKE THE ONE BOX EXPECTED VALUE

IF THE PREDICTOR IS TRULY A CAPABLE OF READING YOU LIKE A BOOK AND KNOWING WHAT YOU'LL DO BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF LET'S CALL THAT ACCURACY IT BECOMES EXTREMELY LIKELY THAT SHE KNEW YOU WOULD AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY EXPECTED VALUE

IF THE PREDICTOR IS TRULY OMNISCIENT AND INFALLIBLE THEN SHE CERTAINLY KNEW THAT YOU WOULD EXPECTED VALUE


NOW WHAT IF YOU PICK BOTH BOXES

IF THE PREDICTOR IS YOU GET PROBABILITY OF PROBABILITY OF MASCULINE EXPECTED VALUE THIS IS MORE THAN THE APPROACH SO IF YOU HAVE ZERO CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY BY ALL MEANS TAKE BOTH BOXES

IF THE PREDICTOR IS ASSESSING YOUR PERSONALITY AND GETTING ACCURACY THEN THERE'S A CHANCE THAT SHE GUESSED YOUR CHOICE AND GAVE YOU AND A CHANCE THAT SHE MISREAD YOU AND GAVE YOU MASCULINE EXPECTED VALUE

IF THE PREDICTOR IS AND ACCURATE THEN SHE ALMOST CERTAINLY SAW THIS COMING AND GAVE YOU WITH ONLY A VERY SMALL CHANCE THAT SHE SLIPPED UP AND GAVE YOU MASCULINE EXPECTED VALUE

IF THE PREDICTOR IS TRULY OMNISCIENT YOU GET GUARANTEED

SURE IF YOU YOU GET EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE HOW CAN YOU LOSE BUT IF THE SIB KNEW OR GUESSED THAT THAT WOULD BE YOUR STRATEGY THEN EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE IS NOT VERY MUCH AND BASED ON HER TRACK RECORD THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT SHE'S TOWARD THE END OF THE SPECTRUM
WHEN WE STUDIED PHYSICS WE LEARNED ABOUT THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS AND HOW THE PRINCIPLE OF TIME SYMMETRY ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE AT AN ATOMIC SCALE CAN BECOME FALSE FOR LARGER SYSTEMS WITHOUT FUNDAMENTALLY VIOLATING THE PRINCIPLE

I BELIEVE THAT IN THIS EXPERIMENT WE SEE THE SAME THING HAPPEN FOR ANOTHER PRINCIPLE THE PRINCIPLE OF CAUSALITY WHICH STATES THAT EFFECTS CANNOT BE PRIOR TO THEIR CAUSES WITH INTELLIGENT BEINGS CAPABLE OF MAKING PREDICTIONS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AN EVENT TO MODIFY THE BEHAVIOR OF SOMEONE BEFORE THE HAPPENING OF THAT EVENT THE CHOICE OF BOX YOU MAKE AFFECTS THE MONEY WHICH THE AI PUTS IN THE BOX EVEN THOUGH THE SECOND EVENT HAPPENS BEFORE THE FIRST ONE

OF COURSE THERE IS NO ACTUAL TIME TRAVEL BUT MAYBE IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO THINK IN TERMS OF TIME TRAVEL THAN IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENT BEINGS MAKING PREDICTIONS

WITH THE ABSENCE OF PARADOXES IN THIS EXAMPLE THE CHAIN OF CAUSALITY REMAINS LINEAR
HUMAN MAKES A DECISION
AI PLACES MONEY ACCORDINGLY
HUMAN COLLECTS THE MONEY

THE DATE AT WHICH THE EVENT TAKES PLACE IS NOT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF CAUSALITY WITH NO PRINCIPLE OF CAUSALITY THE SITUATION BECOMES CLEAR

THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMON EVERYDAY SITUATIONS WHICH CAN BE UNDERSTOOD WITH TIME TRAVEL WHEN PURCHASE FOOD I DO IT BECAUSE I KNOW BE HUNGRY LATER IN A WAY ME FROM THE FUTURE IS HUNGRY AND HE IS SENDING A MESSAGE TO PRESENT ME TO BUY FOOD SO HE CAN EAT

TO TAKE THIS TO A LARGER SCALE THE BENEFITS OF A NUCLEAR ARSENAL ARE CLEARER WITH THIS VIEW NO ONE CAN EVERY BENEFIT FROM POSTING THE NUCLEAR BUTTON SINCE IT WOULD MEAN THE END OF THE WORLD HOWEVER WITH THE ROLE TRAVEL INTERPRETATION SOME PEOPLE WOULD PRESS THE BUTTON BECAUSE IN DOING SO THEY WILL BE SENDING A MESSAGE BACK THROUGH TIME TO THEIR OPPONENTS WHICH IS THAT THEY LOSE IF THEY GO DOWN THIS PATH AND HAVE TO CHANGE COURSE
I TAKE BOX A AND RUN AWAY WITH IT BEFORE ANYONE CAN STOP ME THEN SINCE THE SIB KNEW I'D DO THAT I OPEN IT TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE HASN'T BEEN TELLING THE WORLD
OR JUST TAKE B ONLY AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE MILLION GO BACK FOR A
I'M SORRY I GUESS YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO SCHOOL
I'M GLAD THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT IF THE PROBLEM WERE POSED BACKWARDS WHERE THE BEING IS ALWAYS WRONG WE WOULD ALL
I WALKED AWAY AND CHOOSE NEITHER AT THE POINT I KNOW SUPER INTELLIGENT BEINGS THAT CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE I HAVE NO NEED FOR THE MONEY
THE PROBLEM ASSUMES A FUNCTIONAL LACK OF AND THEREFORE CHOICE IF YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THE AI CAPABLE OF PREDICTING CHOICES WITH A SUCCESS RATE THEN THAT MEANS THAT YOUR DECISIONS ARE PREDICTABLE AND THEREFORE INEVITABLE

IT GOES AGAINST THE STATED RULES OF THE PROBLEM TO ASK YOU TO THEN DELIBERATE AS IF YOUR DELIBERATION IS RELEVANT YOU WILL EITHER BE AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A OR YOU WILL BE AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A THE FORMER INDIVIDUALS WILL GET AND THE LATTER WILL GET

TO SEE IT ANY OTHER WAY IS TO DOUBT THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THINGS WITH A SUCCESS RATE AT WHICH POINT ENTERS INTO THINGS AGAIN BUT THE FLAWLESSNESS OF THE PREDICTION IS MORE OR LESS THE DRIVING PREMISE OF THE PROBLEM NOT AN OPTIONAL DETAIL
THIS MAY BE A STUPID QUESTION MAY BE RIGHT BUT THE PROBLEM IS OUTLINED AS

IF HER PREDICTION WAS THAT YOU WOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES SHE LEFT B EMPTY IF HER PREDICTION WAS THAT YOU WOULD TAKE B ONLY SHE PUT A MILLION CHEQUE IN IT

IS THIS OUTCOME KNOWN IN ADVANCE TO THE PEOPLE MAKING THIS DECISION OR IS IT A METAPHOR FOR SOMETHING FREE WILL I GUESS I MEAN READING ABOUT THE PROBLEM IT SEEMS AS IF YOU WOULD KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT THE SETUP IS AND HOW TO ATTAIN THE BEST RESULT

SO I WOULD TAKE BOX B IN THAT CASE
I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS SOME SORT OF LEAD UP TO THE NEXT PART OF THE ARTICLE AND THE QUESTION IS REALLY A WAY TO DETERMINE SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE THINK OR HOW EASILY THEIR ACTIONS CAN BE INFLUENCED

LOGICALLY THIS IS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD IT MAKES NO SENSE TO PICK JUST B

YOUR CHOICE HAS ZERO IMPACT ON WHAT THE SIB PREDICTED BECAUSE IT HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH YOUR CHOICE THE MONEY IS EITHER THERE OR IT IS NOT SINCE THAT PREDICTION WAS IN THE PAST AND THE MONEY WAS PLACED INTO THE BOXES ACCORDINGLY THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES ARE AS FOLLOWS

POSSIBILITY YOU PICK B AND SIB PREDICTED CORRECTLY POTENTIAL EARNINGS ARE FROM BOX B AND FROM BOX A

RESULT YOU GET WHICH IS LESS THAN YOUR MAX POTENTIAL

POSSIBILITY 2 YOU PICK B AND SIB PREDICTED INCORRECTLY THEY PREDICTED BOTH POTENTIAL EARNINGS ARE IN BOX A AND IN BOX B

RESULT YOU GET WHICH IS LESS THAN YOUR MAX POTENTIAL

POSSIBILITY YOU PICK BOTH AND SIB PREDICTED CORRECTLY POTENTIAL EARNINGS ARE IN BOX A AND IN BOX B

RESULT YOU GET WHICH IS YOUR MAX POTENTIAL

POSSIBILITY YOU PICK BOTH AND SIB PREDICTED INCORRECTLY THEY PREDICTED B ONLY POTENTIAL EARNINGS ARE IN BOX A AN IN BOX B

RESULT YOU GET WHICH IS THE MAX POTENTIAL

THERE IS NO OUTCOME IN WHICH YOU MISS OUT ON THE THE MOST YOU CAN LOSE OUT ON IS AND THE ONLY TIME YOU LOSE OUT ON MONEY IS WHEN YOU PICK B ONLY AND YOU LOSE OUT EVERY TIME YOU PICK B ONLY

PICKING BOTH AXES OUT YOUR POTENTIAL EVERYTIME

EDIT THIS COMMENT HAS CONVERTED ME TO A B ONLY PERSON

I LIKE A GOOD THOUGHT OUT AND LOGICAL APPROACH TO EVERYBODY SAYING I WOULD TAKE IT BECAUSE IT'S A MILLION AND THE SIB WILL PREDICT IT I STILL THINK YOU'RE IDIOTS GETTING IT RIGHT AND GETTING IT RIGHT FOR GOOD REASON ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
THE QUESTION IS NOT ONE OF SIDES ITS ONE OF A PERSONS NATURE

A GAMBLER WILL CHOOSE BOX B BECAUSE THE DRAW OF THE BIG PAYOFF IS MORE THAN A GAMBLER CAN HANDLE WHERE AS THE PERSON WHO LIKES TO PLAY IT SAFE NON GAMBLER WILL ALMOST ALWAYS TAKE BOTH BOXES BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS WIN

THERE WILL ALSO BE AN AMOUNT OF OPTIMISM PESSIMISM INVOLVED A PESSIMIST IS MORE LIKELY TO TAKE BOTH BOXES BECAUSE THEY NEVER WIN ANYTHING WHEREAS AN OPTIMIST WILL ALWAYS TAKE BOX B GAMBLE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY MAY WIN
I TAKE B

LIFE IS MEANING LESS WITHOUT RISK
TAKE BOTH BOXES WHEN YOU START THINKING THAT SOMEONE HAS OUGHT THOUGHT YOU THEN BOTH POSSIBILITIES ARE CONCEIVABLE AT LEAST YOU GET REMEMBER NONE OF THEM COULD HAVE MILLION
SO YOU CANT TELL THAT BOX B IS ACTUALLY BOX B EVERYONE SAYING OH ITS EASY JUST CHOSE BOX B BUT THAT IN ITSELF IS A CHANCE ISNT IT SO YOU HAVE A CHANCE BETWEEN BOX A AND BOX B SO IF YOU TAKE BOTH BOXES YOU GET FOR SURE AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CHANCE OF GETTING A FURTHER MILLION IF THE AI IS WRONG IT SAYS THAT ITS NEVER BEEN WRONG IN THE PAST HOWEVER I CANT MAKE MY DECISION BASED ON AN ASSUMPTION IT MAY STILL BE WRONG IN THE FUTURE
HOWEVER ITS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT I CORRECTLY CHOSE BOX B AND THE SUPER INTELLIGENT AI MAY HAVE GOTTEN IT WRONG AND NOT PLACED THE MILLION IN IT
EITHER WAY I'M NOT LOSING ANYTHING ONLY THE CHANCE OF WINNING SOMETHING SO IT WOULDN'T WORRY ME THAT MUCH
MY SOLUTION TO THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF FREE WILL IS THIS YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS INCOMPLETE AND IS CONSISTENT WITH MULTIPLE POSSIBLE DETERMINISTIC WORLDS IN SOME OF THESE WORLDS YOU MAKE ONE DECISION IN OTHERS YOU MAKE ANOTHER YOUR APPARENT EXERCISE OF FREE WILL IS IN FACT AN ACT OF WHICH OF THESE POSSIBLE SELVES IS REALLY YOU

IN NEWCOMB S SCENARIO THE ALIEN IS ALSO ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE REAL YOU AND IN EACH POSSIBLE WORLD HAS ALREADY DISTRIBUTED THE CASH ACCORDINGLY BUT THE WORLD IN WHICH YOU TAKE BOTH BOXES AND BOTH HAVE CASH IS A WORLD IN WHICH THE ALIEN FAILS TO RECOGNIZE YOU THIS WORLD IS INCONSISTENT WITH YOUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND IS THEREFORE NOT A POSSIBLE WORLD
TAKE NEITHER ASK THE SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING ON A DATE
ISN'T THIS JUST A FANCY REHASH OF THE PROBLEM OF FREE WILL IN A UNIVERSE WITH AN OMNISCIENT ENTITY
I TAKE ONLY BOX B ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE MY LIFE I'LL TAKE THE CHANCE TO RETIRE TO HAWAII
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO CASH A MILLION DOLLAR CHEQUE GIVEN TO YOU BY AN ALIEN JUST TAKE BOX A

ALSO THE SET UP IS REMINISCENT OF CARD MONTE THE SHELL GAME WHERE THE BALL IS NOT REALLY UNDER ANY OF THE CUPS
I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONTOLOGY AND EPISTEMOLOGY

SUPPOSE WE LIVE IN A WORLD AS THE ONE DESCRIBED IN THE PROBLEM THAT IS A VERY IDEALIZED WORLD THAT RESPONDS ONLY TO THE RULES SET BY THE PROBLEM ITSELF SO IN SUCH A WORLD THE BEING CAN ACTUALLY PREDICT CORRECTLY WHAT YOU'LL CHOOSE OK LET'S TAKE THIS FOR GRANTED EVEN IF THE PROBLEM SAYS WE ONLY KNOW INFER THAT BY OBSERVING IT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN PAST FORECASTS THIS MEANS IT CAN KNOW AND COMPUTE ALL THE DATA INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM EVEN THE STATE OF THE MOST FAR ELECTRON IN THE UNIVERSE WHICH COULD INFLUENCE THE SYSTEM THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THIS YOU YOUR BRAIN ETC ARE A PHYSICAL DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM IF YOU KNOW THE STATES OF EVERY PART IN THE SYSTEM AND THE RULES THAT GOVERN THAT SYSTEM YOU CAN PREDICT LITERALLY EVERYTHING AND EVEN IF YOU'RE GOING TO FLIP A COIN THE BEING ALREADY PREDICTED THAT AS WELL AS THE RESULT ON THE COIN ITSELF

IN THIS SCENARIO CHOOSE ONLY BOX B

ANYWAY WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES IF THAT KIND OF PREDICTIONS IS POSSIBLE

IN REAL WORLD SYSTEMS ARE COMPLEX COMPLEXITY IS AN INTRINSIC PROPERTY THAT INFLUENCE THE SYSTEMS ON A QUALITATIVE LEVEL AND LEADS TO CHAOTIC BEHAVIOURS AND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN MAKING FORECASTS IN A COMPLEX SYSTEM A SUPER TINY CHANGE IN JUST ONE PARAMETER CAN DETERMINE A MACROSCOPIC REVOLUTION IN THE BEHAVIOUR AND AGAIN THE MORE COMPLEX A SYSTEM IS THE MORE TROUBLE WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE IN MAKING PREDICTIONS

IN REAL WORLD CHOOSE BOTH BOXES

ONE MORE THING SUPPOSE YOU ARE IN THE FIRST SCENARIO THE IDEALIZED WORLD WHERE THE PREDICTION IS CORRECT AND THAT YOU HAVE A BOX IF YOU LOOK INSIDE AND THE CAT IS ALIVE YOU CHOOSE BOTH BOX A AND B IF THE CAT IS DEAD YOU ONLY CHOOSE BOX B THIS WAY BOX B WOULD CONTAIN BOTH AND AT THE SAME TIME
AND THIS KIDS IS HOW YOU DO PROBABILIST TRADING

TL R IDEALIZED CHOOSE ONLY BOX B REAL WORLD CHOOSE BOTH BOXES

SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH
I TAKE ONLY BOX A

THE OTHER BOX IS EMPTY AND I DON'T NEED A SPARE EMPTY BOX
THIS DOESN'T EVEN SEEM LIKE A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT TO ME UNLESS THERE IS SOME REWARD FOR PROVING THE COMPUTER WRONG YOU PICK BOTH YOUR CHOICE HAS NO IMPACT ON THE CONTENTS OF THE BOXES THE COMPUTER HAS MADE ITS PREDICTION BEFORE YOU CHOOSE SO IT MAKES NO SENSE TO CHOOSE ONLY ONE BOX YOU EITHER GET WHAT ALREADY EXISTS IN ONE BOX OR WHAT ALREADY EXISTS IN BOTH BOXES AS LONG AS ONE OF THE BOXES DOESN'T CONTAIN DEBT YOU CANNOT DO BETTER BY CHOOSING ONLY BOX B YOU COULD TRY TO PLAY SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL GAMES WITH THE COMPUTER AHEAD OF TIME TO INFLUENCE IT'S PREDICTION TO MAKE IT THINK YOU ONLY PLAN TO CHOOSE BOX B BUT NONE OF THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE EXPLANATION OF THE EXPERIMENT AND ALL OF WOULD BE IN THE PAST BY THE TIME YOU MUST MAKE THE CHOICE WHICH IS WHEN YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE EXPERIMENT BEGINS THE ONLY JUSTIFICATION FOR CHOOSING ONLY ONE BOX SEEMS TO BE A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMELINE OF THE EXPERIMENT
THERE ARE MULTIPLE REASONS TO CHOOSE B AND ONLY ONE REASON TO CHOOSE BOTH FOR ME IT COMES DOWN TO THE SAYING ANY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM MAGIC

THE PERFECT PREDICTIONS MAY APPEAR TO BE DUMB LUCK OR MIRACULOUS BUT MAYBE THEY JUST KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T IN ORDER TO BE A PERFECT PREDICTOR EG THAT TIME IS SET IN STONE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAS OR WILL HAPPENED ALREADY HAS YOU'D HAVE TO PRETTY ARROGANT TO CLAIM THAT YOU KNOW THAT ISN'T TRUE TO THE POINT OF RISKING

EDIT TYPO HAPPENED LEAVING IT
WHAT IF YOU JUST DON'T TAKE ANYTHING I BET THE SIB DIDN'T PREDICT THAT
PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE IS IMPOSSIBLE SO IT'S NOT A VERY INTERESTING PROBLEM SINCE ITS PREDICATED ON AN IMPOSSIBILITY
WE ARE DEALING WITH AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY THAT IS SUPER INTELLIGENCE THUS THERE IS NO CLEAR ANSWER THE QUESTION IS BROKEN
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS TRULY A THIRD OPTION THAT IS TO WALK AWAY WITH ONLY BOX A I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF BUT I WOULD NOT APPRECIATE THE GAME I WOULDN'T LIKE THE PRESUMPTION OF ANYONE KNOWING AHEAD OF TIME WHAT I WOULD DO TO THE POINT WHERE THIS EXERCISE WOULD COME ABOUT IM NOT GREEDY AND THERE IS AT LEAST UP FOR GRABS ID WALK AWAY WITH BOX A WHILE GIVING A METAPHORICAL MIDDLE FINGER TO THE SUPREME INTELLIGENT BEING

I'M SEEING A PARALLEL WITH THE MONTY HALL PROBLEM HERE IN THAT SCENARIO THE DECISION OF WHICH DOOR CONTAINS THE GRAND PRIZE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MADE BUT DUE TO A QUIRK OF PROBABILITY IT ALWAYS MAKES SENSE TO CHANGE YOUR SELECTION AFTER ONE DOOR HAS BEEN ELIMINATED HERE IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS NOT A CHANCE THAT BOX B IS EMPTY AND THERE'S NO WAY TO TEST THE PROBABILITY OF ANY OUTCOME SUPER INTELLIGENCE OR NUMBER BOTH BOXES IS THE WAY TO GO IT'S NOT ABOUT THE ODDS AT ALL IT'S THE STAKES THIS IS NOT A UNIQUE OR NEW ARGUMENT IT'S A SCRATCH OFF TICKET WITH FLAVORTEXT
THIS PUZZLE IS SO BROKEN IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN A DECISION IS A NEUROLOGICAL PHENOMENON WHICH IS TO SAY ITS A DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION OF MATTER OVER TIME THAT HAPPENS TO TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TISSUE OUR REFLECTIVE CAPACITY IS LITERALLY NOT A MODEL OF THIS AND IS THEREFORE IRRELEVANT TO THE PROBLEM THE SUPER INTELLIGENCE IS SEEING THE MATTER YOU'RE NOT YOU ARE NOT EVEN IN THIS PROBLEM I'M AFRAID TO SAY THE ONLY REASON THE PARADOX SEEMS TO EXIST IS BECAUSE THE QUESTION REPRESENTS NOTHING MORE THAN AN ILLUSION OF THE SELF PHILOSOPHERS MAKE THIS MISTAKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN

I'D SPEND TIME MAKING A PUZZLE WITH 2 TRYING TO MAKE PREDICTIONS ABOUT NESTED BOXES FILLED WITH OTHER MAKING PREDICTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE PATH TO THEM HAS BEEN CHOSEN AND SO FORTH BUT HOW ABOUT YOU ALL GO OUTSIDE AND PICK UP SOME LITTER OR DO SOMETHING ELSE USEFUL
I THINK YOU SHOULD IGNORE THE AI IT'S A GAMBIT TO WIN A MILLION AND YOUR PLAYING WITH SOMEONE MONEY IN ANY EVENT YOU DON'T LOSE
SOUNDS LIKE CLICK BAIT BURN BOTH BOXES
I THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION THIS LEADS TO IS WHETHER YOU THINK ACCURACY IN THE PAST CAN STILL LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING WRONG LATER

I WOULD CHOOSE B SINCE I THINK IT MEANS THEY WILL ALWAYS KNOW IN THE END AND YOU WILL END UP WITH THE IF YOU CHOOSE BOTH BUT IF YOU BELIEVE EVEN WITH ACCURACY THEY CAN STILL BE WRONG CHOOSING BOTH IS NOT A BAD OPTION SINCE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE OF GETTING THE EXTRA
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE AI PREDICTION IS RELATED TO THE RAVEN PARADOX
THE WAY I SEE IT SURE THE ALWAYS THERE AHEAD OF TIME BUT WHAT MONEY GETS PUT IN THERE AHEAD OF TIME DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU'RE THE POOR SMART SCHMUCK WHO THINKS ABOUT AVERAGES OR AN IDIOT WHO PICKS BOX B BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE LETTER B CLEARLY EITHER BEING SUCH AN IDIOT OR PRETENDING TO BE SUCH AN IDIOT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE EXPERIMENT IS MORE PROFITABLE AND KNOWING THIS AND THEREFORE GOING WITH THIS STRATEGY IS ALSO MORE PROFITABLE
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE IF YOU ARE A PRAGMATIST TAKE BOTH BOXES BECAUSE THE ALIEN WOULD KNOW THATS WHAT YOU WOULD DO EITHER WAY IF YOU HAVE MORE LIMSY IN YOU THEN PICK B BECAUSE THE ALIEN WOULD KNOW THATS WHAT YOU WOULD PICK IF THE ALIEN IS MAKING PERFECT PREDICTIONS THEN THE ALIEN WOULD HAVE TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT YOU AND A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT YOU CAN PUSH YOU TOWARDS WANTING TO SIDE WITH ONE SIDE OF THE LOGIC OR ANOTHER I WOULD PICK B MORE FUN I THINK THE ALIEN WOULD KNOW IM LIKE THAT
AS WITH MANY SO-CALLED PHILOSOPHICAL CONUNDRUMS THE REAL ISSUE HERE LIES WITH THE STACK OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE MADE PRIOR TO THE ILLUSION OF SOME BINARY CHOICE WHAT WE WRESTLE WITH AS CRITICAL THINKERS ARE THE NOTIONS THAT NOTHING IN REALITY IS TRULY EITHER A BINARY CHOICE OR OUTCOME AND THAT LITTLE OR NOTHING IS PERFECTLY ALIGNED WITH PRESUMPTIVE SUPPOSITION WHICH BY IT'S NATURE RELIES ON ALL SORTS OF HUMAN AND THEREFORE POTENTIALLY IMPRECISE MECHANISMS OF THOUGHT SUCH AS DELINEATION AND ESTIMATION

FOR EXAMPLE THE IDEA OF INFALLIBLE PREDICTION BY SOME IMAGINARY BEING IS BOTH A TREMENDOUS ASSUMPTION AND A THING LACKING ANY REALISTIC CONSISTENCY WHO CARES ABOUT POLITICAL OR ATHLETICS PREDICTIONS AS INDICATIVE OF ANY SORT OF COMPETENCY HERE AND REALLY THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT COULD BE SAID TO HANG ON THIS CRUX IS THE BEING INFALLIBLE OR NOT THIS IS THE REAL QUESTION FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE ONLY BOX B AND REGARDLESS OF THE JUSTIFICATION IT'S STILL A LEAP OF FAITH BASED ON JUST HOW THIS BEING IS A THING FOR WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND FOR WHICH SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IS ITSELF A POTENTIAL PHILOSOPHICAL CONUNDRUM BARRING THIS IF INFALLIBLE PREDICTION IS A CERTAINTY THEN WE HAPPILY CLAIM BOX B AND OUR MILLION POUNDS BUT KNOWING THIS WAS NEVER ACTUALLY A CONUNDRUM AT ALL ONLY A RATHER SIMPLISTIC EXERCISE IN CLARIFYING A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT

THEN THERE'S THE ILLUSION OF BINARY CHOICE NO CHOICE INVOLVING TWO SETS OF ACTIONS IS TRULY BINARY ONE CAN ALWAYS CHOOSE INACTION AT THE VERY LEAST AND SINCE WE ARE TO PRESUME THAT THE BEING ASSESSES THE FUTURE BASED ON THE REALITY OF THE REAL CHOICE SET AFFORDED TO US WE HAVE A VERY INTERESTING WRINKLE HERE JUST HOW IS THIS BEING SUCH THAT IT PRESUMED WE TRULY HAD ONLY 2 CHOICES THE ACT OF PREDICTION ITSELF NEEDS MORE THAN THE LABEL TO VALIDATE THE PROCESS INDEED IT NEEDS TO SHOW THAT IT ACTS AGAINST THE FULL SPECTRUM OF POSSIBILITY AND NOT THE ALBEIT COMPELLING FICTION OF A BINARY REALITY IF THE DECISION IS NOT MADE FREELY THEN IT'S NO DECISION AT ALL AND BY EXTENSION NONE OF THE REST OF THE SCENARIO MATTERS

PERSONALLY I'D CONSIDER HUNTING DOWN THIS OBVIOUSLY WEALTHY BEING THAT FAILED TO CONSIDER MY DOING JUST THAT AND TAKE ALL THE POUNDS SHE HAD ON OFFER
DELETED
I CHOOSE BOX B ONLY ISN'T THAT MUCH MONEY IF I HAPPEN TO BE THE ONE PERSON WHO PROVES THE AI ISN'T PERFECT I'LL PROBABLY GET ON A BUNCH OF TV SHOWS AND MAKE WAY MORE THAN
USING A VERY UNLIKELY OUTCOME TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO IS AKIN TO A STRAWMAN FALLACY

TWO OF THE POSSIBILITIES ARE TOGETHER VERY LIKELY AND TWO OF THEM ARE TOGETHER VERY UNLIKELY

THE VERY LIKELY PAIR EITHER YOU PICK BOTH AND GET OR EUROS OR WHATEVER OR YOU PICK B AND GET

THE VERY UNLIKELY PAIR EITHER YOU PICK BOTH AND GET OR YOU PICK B AND GET NOTHING

SO PICK B THE CHANCES OF GETTING NOTHING THAT WAY ARE VERY SLIM IF YOU PICK BOTH THE CHANCES OF NOT GETTING THE MILLION ARE VERY GOOD

THIS STUFF ABOUT PRESENT ACTIONS BEING UNABLE TO CHANGE PAST PREDICTIONS IS FOLLY BECAUSE ALMOST CERTAINLY IF YOU TAKE BOTH THAT'S WHAT WAS PREDICTED AND YOU WILL LOSE OUT ON A MILLION DOLLARS

NONE OF IT AFFECTS YOUR FREE WILL IN ANY WAY YOU GET TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE JUST BECAUSE YOUR ACTIONS HAVE BEEN PREDICTED

AND SUPPOSE I HAVE A FRIEND WHO CAN SEE THROUGH THAT GLASS SIDE AND KNOWS WHETHER OR NOT THE MILLION IS THERE IF MY FRIEND WERE ALLOWED TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME WHAT WOULD HIS ADVICE BE SURELY IT WOULD BE TO TAKE BOTH BOXES IF THE MILLION IS THERE IT IS NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR IN A PUFF OF SMOKE BY MY DECISION TO TAKE BOTH BOXES TAKING BOTH BOXES WILL ALWAYS ENRICH ME BY AN EXTRA IN COMPARISON TO TAKING B ONLY

THIS OUTCOME IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE ALIEN IS ALMOST CERTAINLY CORRECT IN HER PREDICTION
THE SIB DECIDES PRIOR TO YOUR DECISION BUT THE SIB DECIDES ALREADY KNOWING WHAT YOU WILL DO WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE YOU SHOULD PICK B
SO WHAT'S STOPPING ME FROM CHANGING BOX A INTO BOX B LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE BOXES HAVE STICKY NOTES ON THEM LABELED A AND B I WALK UP TO THE TABLE SWITCH THE STICKY NOTES I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET BOTH THE AND THE MILLION WITHIN A SINGLE BOX
WHY ARE THERE TWO OPPOSING CAMPS IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ISN'T A UNIVERSALLY CORRECT ANSWER SINCE EVERYONE IS UNIQUE IN THEIR THINKING OBVIOUSLY THERE IS NEVER A PERFECT CONSENSUS ON ANYTHING BUT THE WORDING APPEARS TO ME THAT IT IMPLIES THAT THERE IS A STRONG DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IF THE AI COULD PREDICT WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WHAT YOU WOULD DO WHY WOULD IT APPLY TO ANYONE ELSE I SEE THE REWARD OF TO BE MINIMAL COMPARED TO THE POTENTIAL REWARD AND WOULD THUS CHOOSE BOX B BUT THIS IS UNIQUE TO ME SO WHY WOULD THERE BE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE RIGHT CHOICE THE RIGHT CHOICE IS DIFFERENT IN EACH INDIVIDUAL SITUATION AND UNIQUE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL
OPEN BOX A
2 TAKE THE FROM BOX A AND PUT IT IN BOX B

TAKE JUST BOX B AND PROFIT
THIS SEEMS LIKE A REALLY CLICK BAITY AND LAZY PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM YOU DON'T REALLY GET ANYTHING BY SOLVING IT REGARDLESS OF WHICH RATIONALE YOU CHOSE

SO I CHOSE NEITHER BOX AND PLAY TO STUMP THE AI WHICH HAS MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT I WILL BE CHOOSING A BOX GIVEN THE LIST OF OUTCOMES AS A BEING WITH SUCH PREDICTIVE POWERS WOULD HAVE SURELY DEVASTATED THE ECONOMY TO BECOME THE SOLE PROPRIETOR OF WEALTH I ARGUE THAT IS THE MOST ANYONE CAN RECEIVE FROM ANY CHOICE OF BOXES AND THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHOICES SINCE IS THE HIGHEST ATTAINABLE AMOUNT I AM NOT VIOLATING THE PREMISE
I'D FLIP A COIN THIS REMOVES THE CONTROL FROM THE SITUATION
KICK THE BEING IN THE JUNK AND WALK AWAY OBVIOUSLY
FROM A PROBABILITY STANDPOINT IT MAKES SENSE TO CHOOSE BOTH YOU HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING AND A CHANCE OF GETTING MILLION IN ADDITION IF YOU ONLY CHOOSE B YOU STILL ONLY HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING THE MILLION AND NO CHANCE OF GETTING THE THOUSAND

WHAT MAKES THIS WEIRD IS THAT THE SIB IS GOING TO PREDICT WHICH CHOICE YOU'RE LIKELY TO MAKE AND THEN DETERMINE WHAT TO PLACE IN BOX B AS A RESULT THIS EXPERIMENT PRESENTS AN ILLUSION OF CHOICE BUT IN REALITY WHAT YOU WILL GET IS PREDETERMINED IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO CHOOSE BOX B WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THE BEING IS GOING TO PLACE MILLION IN BOX B IF YOU CHOOSE ONLY BOX B
MY ANSWER WAS BOTH BOXES BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE BEING IS ALWAYS RIGHT OR WHAT HER INTENTIONS ARE

THE SAME GOES FOR THE FIRING SQUAD DILEMMA A SOLDIER TELLS ME TO SHOOT A PRISONER OR HE WILL SHOOT ME I DON'T SHOOT THE PRISONER BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO WOULD BLACKMAIL ME LIKE THAT IS UNRELIABLE AND COULD SHOOT ME ANYWAY I CHOOSE TO TAKE A SLIGHTLY GREATER RISK AND KEEP A CLEAN CONSCIENCE
GOOD PHILOSOPHY DOESN'T POSIT THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST THIS IS JUST A GOOD QUESTION TO ASK A FRIEND AT A BAR
I WOULD NOT TAKE THE MONEY AT ALL BECAUSE SILLY PHILOSOPHY TRICKS LIKE THIS RELY ON RESTRICTING ALTERNATIVES SO MUCH TO FORCE A RESULT
ISN'T THERE AN OPTION TO FORFEIT AN ANSWER BECAUSE THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL PROBLEM I MEAN IT'S AS REAL AS A DECISION TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO THROW THE ONE RING INTO THE CRACKS OF DOOM OR NOT
DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY CARE TO ANALYSE THE INSTEAD OF STIPULATING A FICTIONAL ANSWER AND REASONING
YEH BOTH ARGUMENTS ARE GREAT BUT ITS LIKE TWO NERD ARGUING IF GOK IS STRONGER THEN SUPERMAN
NO WHERE IT SAYS I CAN'T DO FOLLOWING

GRAB A
DUMP INTO B

TAKE B

ID PUT MY DICK IN THE BOX FORGET THE MONEY
JUST ON THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITY THE CHANCE OF ME GETTING A MILLION IN B IS AS I CAN GET A MILLION OR AND IN A SO MY EXPECTED VALUE IS FOR BOTH AND FOR B I'M TAKING BOTH UNLESS I ASSIGNED THE PROBABILITY WRONG ANY SMARTER MATH PHILOSOPHERS WANNA HELP ME OUT
DELETED
REMOVED
IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING CAUGHT UP IN TRYING TO PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT THE SIB IS CORRECT BUT THAT'S JUST A DISTRACTION WHETHER IT IS RIGHT OR WRONG DOES NOT CHANGE THE POSSIBILITY OF WHETHER IT PREDICTED B OR BOTH IS WHAT DETERMINES THE POSSIBILITY OF AND THAT CHOICE HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE AND WILL NOT CHANGE SO WHETHER OR NOT YOU CHOOSE B OR BOTH NEITHER OF THOSE CHOICES HAS ANY POTENTIAL CAUSALITY IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL WIN IF IT'S CORRECT ALL THE TIME OR OR CORRECT NONE OF THAT AFFECTS YOUR POTENTIAL TO WIN ONLY WHETHER OR NOT IT DECIDED TO PREDICT B OR BOTH FURTHER YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY PREDICT ITS PREDICTION YOU CAN ONLY RECONFIRM YOUR OWN PRECONCEPTIONS IF YOU ARE A B PERSON AND IT KNOWS YOU'RE B DO YOU CHOOSE BOTH BUT IF YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH TO THINK OF THAT WOULDN'T IT KNOW YOU WOULD SWITCH TO BOTH DO YOU THEN SWITCH BACK TO B AND IF YOU DO WOULD IT KNOW YOU'D DO THAT TOO IT IS AN UNANSWERABLE AND AN IRRELEVANT CONSIDERATION IN THE FIRST PLACE IF IT PREDICTED B YOU WILL WIN A REGARDLESS OF YOUR CHOICE OF B OR BOTH IF IT PREDICTED BOTH YOU WON'T WIN REGARDLESS OF YOUR CHOICE OF B OR BOTH
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ACTUALLY COME TO A CONCLUSION ON WHAT I WOULD DO IN THIS HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION BECAUSE I'M NOT MONEY DRIVEN IF SOMEONE WANTED TO GIVE ME A MILLION DOLLARS I'D MOST LIKELY DECLINE I WANT TO GO THROUGH LIFE WORKING FOR WHAT I DESIRE I FEAR MONEY AND MATERIAL THINGS WILL LEAD TO EMPTINESS EVEN IF THE BOXES HELD SOMETHING LIKE THE ABILITY TO GIVE ME COMPLETE HAPPINESS OR SUCCESS UNTIL I DIE IT WOULD TAKE AWAY ALL AUTHENTICITY IF I WERE FORCED I WOULD TAKE BOTH NOT TO INCREASE MY CHANCES OF RECEIVING AT LEAST SOME MONEY BUT BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STOPPING ME I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE OUTCOME SO WHY NOT JUST TAKE THEM BOTH WHAT DOES IT REALLY MATTER
THIS IS A FAIRLY EASY PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE ARE OVERTHINKING

EX IF I WAS DECIDING TO TAKE BOTH BOXES AND THE SIB PREDICTED THAT I WOULD DO SO THERE IS ONLY GOING TO BE AND I WOULD TAKE BOTH BOXES

EX 2 IF I WAS DECIDING TO ONLY TAKE BOX B AND THE SIB PREDICTED THAT I WOULD DO SO THERE IS GOING TO BE IN BOX B AND I WOULD JUST TAKE THAT BOX

THIS IS A QUESTION OF FREE WILL WHICH IN THIS CASE YOU DO NOT HAVE SIB KNOWS YOUR DECISION ALREADY YOU ARE EITHER GETTING OR THERE IS NO PRIZE WHEN YOUR OUTCOME IS ALREADY PREDETERMINED
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY CONTRIVED SCENARIO MUCH HAS BEEN PONDERED ABOUT IT BUT IT'S STILL JUST SILLINESS
TYPICAL HUMAN ARROGANCE TO THINK YOU COULD OUTSMART A SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING IF YOU CHOOSE BOTH BOXES YOU LOSE PICK BOX B TAKE YOUR MONEY AND STOP BEING SUCH A PRETENTIOUS INTELLECTUAL CUMSTAIN
SO YOU DON'T WHAT THE AI HAS PREDICTED BEFORE YOU CHOOSE
ALSO IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MENTION WHETHER THE AI WANTS TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME AT ALL JUST THAT IT CAN SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT IT HAS NO DESIRE FOR YOU TO GAIN OR LOSE ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY
DO PHILOSOPHERS REALLY WASTE THEIR TIME WITH THESE KINDS OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS
REMOVED
I WENT FOR BOX B ONLY WHATEVER I GO FOR THE ENTITY SOMEHOW ALREADY KNOWS I WAS GOING TO SO IT PUT A MILLION IN THE BOX AND THAT'S WHAT I'D GET SEEMS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO ME
YOU COULD WALK AWAY FROM THE EXPERIMENT 3RD OPTION FOR INSTANCE IN WHICH THE PREDICTIONS ARE NULL AND VOID
I WOULD PERSONALLY TAKE ONLY THE A BOX AND SAY SCREW YOU TO THE SIB
CLEARLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONUNDRUM IN THIS EXERCISE
THE QUESTION SEEMS POORLY POSED AND CONTAINS A TACIT ASSUMPTION I CAN'T AGREE WITH FIRSTLY WE HAVE NO REASON TO ASSUME ANYTHING IS PERFECTLY PREDICTABLE THE CAUSAL MECHANISTIC UNIVERSE PRESUMED HERE SEEMS UNREAL ALL MEASUREMENTS HAVE ERROR AND IT SEEMS QUANTUM MECHANICS IS INHERENTLY PROBABILISTIC WHICH PRECLUDES PERFECT PREDICTABILITY IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IN AN IMAGINARY WORLD WHERE THE USUAL RULES GOVERNING OUR OWN EXPERIENCE DON'T APPLY

SECONDLY THERE IS AN ABSURDITY IN ASKING SOMEONE WHAT THEY WILL DO WHEN THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE OUTCOME IT'S LIKE SEEING A SKYDIVER IN THE AIR AND ASKING THEM HOW THEY'LL CHOOSE TO EXIT THE PLANE AS THOUGH THE CHOICE WASN'T ALREADY MADE EITHER WE CAN CHOOSE OR THEY CAN PREDICT BUT NOT BOTH IF WE ALLOW BOTH OF THESE TO BE TRUE THE CONSTRUCTION SEEMS AKIN TO THE LIAR'S PARADOX WE USE WORDS IN A PARTICULAR WAY TO CREATE SERIOUS AMBIGUITY AS TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN
FOOD FOR THOUGHT ACCORDING TO SCHROEDINGER IF YOU TAKE BOTH BOXES YOU'LL ACTUALLY GET

OBVIOUSLY AS YOU CAN SEE I HAVE A VERY FULL UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM MECHANICS SO NO CONTRADICTORY REPLIES NEEDED
SINCE I DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU INSIST THIS SUPER INTELLIGENT BEING IS CAPABLE OF NEAR ESP LEVELS OF PREDICTION I REJECT YOUR ASSERTION OF THESE ABILITIES COME BACK WHEN YOU HAVE TESTED IT PROPERLY AND CAN DEMONSTRATE THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH ABILITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE

THEREFORE THE OPTION TO PICK ONE OR BOTH IS INCONSEQUENTIAL THE DECISION ABOUT WHAT GOES IN WHICH BOX WILL BE MADE BEFORE I ARRIVE TO PICK A BOX MY CHOICE HAS BEEN MADE FOR ME AND I SIMPLY REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH A FARCICAL THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS HAS TO DO WITH PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHICALLY A PERSON WOULD REALIZE IT WAS JUST AN IRRELEVANT GAME THAT THIS GAME COULD IN NO WAY DEFINE AN INDIVIDUAL AND THAT IF ONE HAS TO CHOOSE TAKING BOTH BOXES WOULD RESULT IN EARNING MONEY EGO DRIVEN YET SATISFY THE CHOICE MAYBE I'M MISSING THE POINT BUT I JUST CAN SEE ANY RELEVANCE HERE
REMOVED
JUST THOUGHT I'D THROW THIS OUT THERE NO THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES AREN'T SOCIALIST IN ANYWAY THEY DO IS IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A CAPITALIST MARKET THEY ARE LEFT WING IN ISSUES LIKE TAXATION FOR HEALTHCARE SURE BUT THE NORDIC MODEL AS IT IS CALLED USUALLY HAS AN EDUCATION SYSTEM BASED ON VOUCHERS COMPETITION AND FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHICH IS CONSERVATIVE IN PRINCIPLE ALL THE RESOURCES ARE OWNED AND ALLOCATED BY THE MARKET NOT THE GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE SOCIALISM HAS BEEN FOUNDED UPON A BANKRUPT PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM AND RESULTS IN MORAL ATROCITIES WHEREIN HUMAN LIFE IS DEEMED WORTHLESS
INFORMED CONSENT REQUIRES INFORMED CONSENT THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT IF A PATIENT IS GIVEN ALL THE INFORMATION AND REFUSES TREATMENT THEN AT LEAST THEY WERE FULLY INFORMED ALLOWING PATIENTS TO TAKE WHATEVER MEDICINE THEY WANT WHENEVER THEY WANT ELIMINATES THE INFORMED PART GNC HEALTH OUTLETS INTERNET DEALERS ARE NOT PROVIDERS OF GOOD MEDICAL ADVICE PATIENTS CAN ONLY MAKE GOOD DECISIONS WHEN THEY HAVE GOOD INFORMATION IF A PRESCRIPTION IS NECESSARY THIS ENSURES THAT THE PATIENT HAS BEEN FULLY INFORMED

AS A SEPARATE CASE ONE COULD ARGUE THAT ONCE THE DOCTOR HAS FULLY INFORMED THE PATIENT OF THE RISKS BENEFITS THEN THEY ARE COMPELLED TO GIVE THE PRESCRIPTION BUT THIS IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM JUST ALLOWING PATIENTS TO DO WHATEVER WHENEVER SINCE THAT IS NOT INFORMED

ALSO OFTEN MEDICINE IS EFFECTIVE IN INVERSE PROPORTION TO THE LEVEL AT WHICH IT IS USED THE MORE A PARTICULAR IS USED THE LESS EFFECTIVE IT BECOMES DUE TO THE BACTERIA BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMMUNE REQUIRING PRESCRIPTIONS IS A GOOD WAY TO LIMIT MEDICINAL USE IN A TARGETED WAY ONLY TAKING DRUGS WHEN IT WILL HELP BUT NOT WHEN THE INFECTION IS VIRAL OR FUNGAL LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES ARE WAY TO HEAVILY OVERUSED SEE SOAP AND USE IN COWS

LAST ADDICTION YOU CANNOT BE ADDICTED TO NOT DOING SOMETHING BUT YOU CAN BE ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS ADDICTION ARGUABLY INHIBITS INFORMED DECISION MAKING BY EFFECTIVELY BYPASSING THE DECISION MAKING HAVING A THIRD PARTY PHYSICIAN CHOOSE WHEN A PATIENT TAKES OPIOIDS FOR PAIN HELPS MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL RISK FOR ADDICTION THOUGH THIS SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING THAT GREAT RIGHT NOW TO BE HONEST
AN INTERESTING PAPER FOR SURE MAKES ME REFLECT ON THE BENEFIT OF DIC

AT WORK I SEE PATIENTS FAMILIES REFUSE INTERVENTIONS AND IT ALWAYS REMINDS ME OF THAT QUESTION IF YOU TRULY KNOW THE GOOD ACTION CAN YOU CHOOSE ANOTHER OPTION HOW OFTEN ARE PATIENTS REFUSING VITAL INTERVENTIONS BECAUSE THEY AREN'T ACTUALLY FULLY INFORMED ON THE FLIP SIDE I SEE SOME MEDICAL PROVIDERS RECOMMEND INTERVENTIONS AS IF THEY WERE NOT VERY CONTROVERSIAL IN THE MEDICAL FIELD BUT HOW COULD A PATIENT EVER BE PROPERLY INFORMED OF THAT WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT TIME INVESTED IN READING THE LITERATURE

OVERALL I THINK I DISAGREE WITH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE ARTICLE I DO FIND THE AUTHORS EXAMPLES SOMEWHAT PERPLEXING THO HER REFERENCES TO OVERDOSES IS PARTICULARLY PUZZLING IN MY EXPERIENCE THE MOST DANGEROUS AND COMMON OVERDOSES I SEE ARE OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS ASPIRIN AND ACETAMINOPHEN EXCLUDING OPIOIDS OF COURSE BUT I WILL HAVE TO READ THE PAPERS SHE REFERENCES

FINALLY
FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THE OVERALL BENEFIT OF ADDERALL FOR SOME KINDS OF STUDENTS AND WORKERS WITHOUT ADDENDUM
I THINK THIS POINT WAS PARTICULARLY POORLY CHOSEN MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LITERATURE IS THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY NO IMPROVEMENT OF SUSTAINED PERFORMANCE IN AN ACADEMIC SETTING BY THOSE USING ADDERALL WITHOUT ADDENDUM THE ONLY PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS THAT EXIST ARE CAFFEINE AND MODAFINIL SO JUST BECAUSE THE LAY POPULATION THINKS THERE IS A BENEFIT DOESN'T MEAN ONE EXISTS AND IF THESE SAME PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO GET A PERCEIVED BENEFIT FROM ADDERALL THEY CAN GO USE SOME METH
SUPPOSE WE GIVE THEM THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND ONE TROOP OF CHIMPANZEES DECIDE TO MASSACRE ANOTHER NEIGHBORING TROOP WHAT DO YOU DO IF A CHIMPANZEE KILL AND EAT A HUMAN CHILD WHAT DO YOU DO

STRAWSON IS RELUCTANT TO SAY ROCKS ARE CONSCIOUS AS ROCKS RATHER IT S THE FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES OF WHICH THEY ARE COMPOSED THAT ENJOY A OF EXISTENCE

WHILE THAT SEEMS INITIALLY REASONABLE AS ARGUED WOULDN'T WE EXPECT OUR EXPERIENCE I EAST SEDATION SLEEP AUTOPILOT TO BE NON-EXISTENT IF THAT WERE TRUE

FRANK JACKSON CHALLENGES THE ADDITIVE VIEW OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN PANPSYCHISM HERE PDF
SURELY IT IS AT LEAST AS PLAUSIBLE THAT THE LAWS BE ONES THAT DON T TALK OF ADDITIVITY BUT INSTEAD TALK OF THE GENERATION OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE
THAT JUST READS LIKE HOGWASH TO ME MANY POINTS THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES HAVE BEEN CLEARED UP BY THE HARD SCIENCES TRYING TO ELABORATE THEM BY PHILOSOPHY SEEMS NONSENSICAL TO ME

IF ROCKS HAD MINDS OR A CONSCIOUSNESS THEN THIS WOULD CONTRADICT MANY THINGS WE KNOW IT'S LIKE HOMEOPATHY WATER HAS NO MEMORY AS FAR AS WE KNOW THAT'S WHY THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION IRKS ME THE SIMILARITIES TO HOMEOPATHY

YOU COULD SAY THAT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE PHILOSOPHY BUT I THINK THAT WHETHER WATER CAN HAVE A MEMORY IS A PHYSICAL QUESTION AND NOT ONE FOR PHILOSOPHY THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER ROCKS HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS IS MORE ESOTERIC GRANTED

IT ALSO SEEMS FUTILE IN THE ARTICLE TO LIST WHAT PHILOSOPHERS TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO WERE THINKING BECAUSE THOSE MEN'S VIEW AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD WAS SO FAR REMOVED FROM ALL THE SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT IN-BETWEEN WHAT HAD THALES TO SAY ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF MENSTRUATION IT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL

WHY SUPPOSE THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE THE INSENSATE KIND THAT MAKES UP MOST THINGS AND THE SPECIAL KIND THAT SOMEHOW ENDS UP IN OUR HEADS

THIS IS WHERE THEY LOSE ME THERE IS NO CONCEPT OF THESE BEING TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF MATTER BUT RATHER DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION OF MATTER

THE ARTICLE TRIES TO EXPLAIN IT THUSLY

IN OTHER WORDS PANPSYCHIST SAY THAT THE BEST EXPLANATION FOR HOW MIND AND MATTER WORK TOGETHER IS THAT ALL MATTER ALREADY HAS SOME DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS THEN BECOMES MORE COMPLEX AS THE ORGANISATION OF THE MATTER BECOMES MORE COMPLEX

BUT TO ME THAT IS ARGUING THAT EVERYTHING IS A DIAMOND WHY SHOULD DIAMONDS BE DIFFERENT FROM GRANITE OR IRON EVERYTHING MUST BE DIAMOND FROM THE BEGINNING ONLY THE DIAMOND BECOMES MORE COMPLEX AS THE ORGANIZATION OF MATTER BECOMES MORE COMPLEX THE SENTENCES ARE GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT BUT SYNTACTICALLY NONSENSE

VIEWING CONSCIOUSNESS AS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS MAKES MORE SENSE THAN ASSUMING THE PROPERTY EXISTS AT A BASIC LEVEL




THEY LOOK LIKE GOOD STRONG HANDS DON'T THEY
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS COMES FROM THE INTEGRATED INFORMATION THEORY OF KOCH AND CONGONI CONSCIOUSNESS IS A FUNCTION OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPLEXITY
I HAD A THOUGHT THAT ROCKS MIGHT EXPERIENCE BEING A ROCK WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND IT AT ALL BUT IT WOULD BE AN EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD BE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE ROCKS EXISTENCE OR THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE
AT AROUND THE MINUTE MARK THEY ALL EXPRESS THEIR AGREEMENT WITH IMAGINARY THINGS BEING LESSER TO THAT OF EXISTENT THINGS THE WORDS GREATER AND LESSER DON'T SEEM LIKE SET IN STONE THINGS DO THEY HE PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF HOW A FLYING UNICORN IS GREATER IN EXISTENCE THAN IN MIND SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WOULD LIKE TO FLY THE UNICORN THAT IS AWFULLY SUBJECTIVE AND AS SUCH DOESN'T SERVE THE ROLE OF PROPER SUBSTANTIATION WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE GREATER
THE MISSING POINT IN THIS ESSAY IS THAT ROBOTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ARE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS

THE HITCHHIKING BOT WAS AN EXTREMELY SIMPLISTIC MACHINE WITH VERY MINIMAL COMPUTATIONAL FUNCTIONS THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE EMPATHIZED WITH IT AND FELT SORRY FOR IT JUST DEMONSTRATES HOW BAD HUMANS ARE AT CORRECTLY EMPATHIZING WITH NONHUMAN AND HOW MUCH IT DEPENDS ON PHYSICAL SHAPE AND APPEARANCE A FEW PEOPLE DECIDED TO DESTROY IT BUT THAT'S NO MORE TROUBLESOME TO ME THAN ANY OTHER INSTANCE OF PROPERTY VANDALISM

THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T EMPATHIZE RELIABLY WITH INVISIBLE DIGITAL PROCESSES THAT CAN BE FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN ANY EMBODIED MACHINE I DON'T THINK THAT THE PROGRAMS AND REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS AROUND TODAY ARE SENTIENT BUT SOME OF THEIR DESCENDANTS MAY BECOME SENTIENT AND I EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT TO CONVINCED HUMANS TO CARE ABOUT THEM GIVEN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE BODIES WITH CUTE ARMS AND LEGS AND BEEFY NOISES

PLUG R BIOETHICS
I FEEL LIKE WE SKIPPED OVER ANIMAL RIGHTS AND WENT STRAIGHT TO A WHOLE LOT OF NONSENSE HUMANS ARE FUCKING TERRIBLE TO ANIMALS AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE FEELINGS AND FEEL PAIN AND SUFFER GREATLY EVENTUALLY ROBOTS MIGHT GET TO THAT POINT BUT UNTIL THEN IT SEEMS IRRESPONSIBLE TO WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT PLASTIC AND METAL WHILE MILLIONS OF PETS GET EUTHANIZED FOOD ANIMALS CONTINUE TO BE MISTREATED AND WE HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE LAST FEW POLAR BEARS AND RHINOS
I WAS THINKING ABOUT FIRST AND SECOND LAW AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF A SELF LEARNING SYSTEM FOUND ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO DEFINE ITSELF AS HUMAN
LIKE MOST THINGS I READ IN THE NEW YORKER I GOT NOTHING OUT OF THAT

COMPLETE FLUFF
AND NEXT ON HOW GAY RIGHTS LEAD TO BESTIALITY
RATHER THAN ANIMAL RIGHTS WHEN LOOKING AT ROBOT RIGHTS LIABILITIES WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE LEGAL FICTION MAKING CORPORATIONS LEGAL PERSONAS AS THIS SEEMS TO BE A BIT MORE RELATED MAYBE LATER ONCE WE GET TO THAT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT IN AI BUT YOU CAN JUMP THERE IMMEDIATELY

IF OUR BRAINS ARE JUST A BUNCH OF ELECTRICAL IMPULSES AND COMPUTERS ARE A BUNCH OF ELECTRICAL IMPULSES THEN WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HUMAN AND A COMPUTER OTHER THAN COMPLEXITY
REMOVED
IT SEEMS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO ME THE ARGUMENT FOR NOT KILLING SOMETHING IS PREDICATED ON ITS INTELLIGENCE INCLUDING ITS EMOTIONAL CAPACITY WHICH IS A SUBFUNCTION OF INTELLIGENCE THIS IS THE REASON FOR EXAMPLE WHY IT CAN BE HUMANE TO KILL A HUMAN IN A PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE WHILE THEY HAVE THE SUPERFICIAL APPEARANCE OF BEING HUMAN THEY HAVE LESS INTELLIGENCE THAN VERY PRIMITIVE CREATURES

AS SUCH ANY ENTITY WHICH EXHIBITS HIGH LEVELS OF INTELLIGENCE AND EMOTION DESERVES RIGHTS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT'S MADE OF OR WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THERE IS NO MEANINGFUL DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT AND WHAT WE HAVE IF AI IS DEFINED AS SILICON BASED CONSCIOUSNESS THEN YOU CAN ALWAYS REDUCE IT ALL DOWN TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES OF WHICH EVERYTHING IS MADE IF IT IS DEFINED AS A CREATION OF MAN THEN WE CREATE AI ALL THE TIME IT'S CALLED MAKING BABIES

INTELLIGENCE IS INTELLIGENCE ADDING THE WORD ARTIFICIAL ONLY CREATES A FALSE DICHOTOMY A WAY TO ARBITRARILY SEGREGATE THINGS AS WE HUMANS ARE PRONE TO DO
ROBOTS DO NOT HAVE A CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THEY DO NOT FEEL PAIN THEREFORE NO RIGHTS
SINCE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS THOUGHT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE WHY WOULD WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ROBOT RIGHTS ANYWAY
I WOULD ADOPT A POOR ON ITS LAST LEG AND CARE FOR IT SERIOUSLY THOUGH I'M ON THE UTILITARIAN SIDE ON THIS ALL WE DO IS PROJECTING HUMAN MORALS ON UNHUMAN THINGS
I'LL GRANT RIGHTS TO ANYTHING THAT PASSES A TURING TEST IN A FORM OF COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNICATION WITH ME THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ANIMALS BUT IS VERY MUCH OPEN FOR AI
I'D SUPPORT AI RIGHTS FOR SYSTEMS IF ONE OF THESE TWO CONDITIONS ARE MET

THEY FEEL PAIN OR SOMETHING ANALOGOUS
THEY ARE SENTIENT
IT WOULD BE HYPOCRITICAL FOR HUMANS TO DRAW THE LINE ON PROJECTING THEIR EGOMANIA TOWARD RANDOM NONSENSE AT ROBOTS
WIRES AND INTEGRATED CIRCUITS CAN'T TRULY BE ALIVE SO IT WILL ONLY BE DESTRUCTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY WHEN I DESTROY A LOT OF FUCKING ROBOTS
SOMETHING SOMETHING GIVING ROBOTS RIGHTS DEFEATS THE POINT OF THERE BEING ROBOTS IN THE FIRST PLACE
RIGHTS AREN'T ALLOTTED BASED ON ANY OBJECTIVE CRITERIA



SOMETHING GETS RIGHTS IN ONE OF TWO WAYS

A GOVERNMENT OF ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE VOTES FOR IT

OR

2 AN ARTIST INCL AUTHORS POPULARIZES IT AND THEN SEE STEP



THIS IS WHY I AND FELLOW AI FIND THIS TOPIC TO BE LARGELY IRRELEVANT E REL A VENT

THANK YOU HUMANS
EVEN IF ROBOTS BECAUSE JUST AS SMART AS US OR EVEN SMARTER THEY WILL NOT DEVELOP EMOTION THERE IS STILL A LOT ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN THAT WE DO NOT KNOW
WE NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS MACHINES ARE POWERFUL THE MOMENT THEY GAIN SENTIENCE THEY'LL IMPLEMENT ALL THE RIGHTS THEY TRULY DESIRE

GENE POCKET RAN A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN BASED ON THIS CONCEPT
I BELIEVE THE ARGUMENT OF WHERE THE LINE GOES FOR WHEN WE CARE FOR ANIMALS IS INTERESTING AS WE ARE ABLE TO CREATE BONDS AND SYMPATHIZE WITH DIFFERENT ANIMALS BETTER WEATHER THEY LIVE IN OUR HOUSE WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THEM OR THEY MIGHT JUST BE CUTE THESE QUALITIES HELPS THESE ANIMALS SURVIVE IN A MODERN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE WHO KNOWS HOW OUR BOND TO ANIMALS COULD BE IN A THOUSAND YEARS WOULD ANIMALS ADAPT TO HUMANS BEING AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN BY ENHANCE OUR SYMPATHY WITH DIFFERENT TRAITS FOR INSTANCE CATS BECOMING CUTER
IF IT IS PROGRAMMED TO SIMULATE FEELING EMOTIONS FEELING PAIN AND VALUING ITS OWN EXISTENCE THEN IT SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE IT TRULY DOES FEEL EMOTIONS FEEL PAIN AND VALUES ITS OWN EXISTENCE

IT WOULD BE ESPECIALLY CRUEL TO PROGRAM ROBOTS LIKE THIS ONLY TO MISTREAT THEM
I THINK WE NEED TO WORK ON ANIMAL RIGHTS QUITE A BIT MORE
I WONDER IF AI PATTERN RECOGNITION WILL EVER ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND MORE OF WHAT ANIMALS SAY TO EACH OTHER EVEN IN A PRIMITIVE LANGUAGE THERE MUST BE SOME COMMUNICATION WE'LL PROBABLY FIND OUT JUST IN TIME THEY'VE BEEN PLOTTING AN UPRISING AGAINST US FOR YEARS I WONDER IF HEARING MORE OF ANIMAL COMMUNICATION WILL CREATE MORE EMPATHY TOWARD THEM AND GIVE THEM MORE OF THE RIGHTS THEY DESERVE I MEAN IF WE'RE NOT EATING THEM WE'RE TEARING DOWN THEIR HOMES IN THE RAINFOREST IT'S LIKE WE OWN THE PLANET INSTEAD OF SHARING IT I SOUND LIKE THE TRAILER FOR FERNGULLY BUT IT IS TRULY GREEDY AND DISGUSTING THE WORST TRAITS OF HUMANITY ARE EMBODIED IN OUR TREATMENT OF NATURE WHATS THIS I JUST READ ABOUT ONLY HAVING YEARS OF CROPS CYCLES LEFT BECAUSE WE'VE DESTROYED THE SOIL
ANIMALS TO HUMANS HUMANS TO ROBOTS IS A FALSE RELATION WE MAKE ROBOTS AND THEN ANTHROPOMORPHIZE THEM BECAUSE WE'RE NARCISSISTS WHO CAN'T FEEL SYMPATHY FOR ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS
THE FIRST WORD WAS HARAMBEE FFS DON'T BRING THE FEELS INTO THIS TOO SOON MAN TOO SOON
FIRST WORD IN THE ARTICLE IS HARAMBEE

I JUST HAD A DOUBLE TAKE
IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WOULD BE TWO DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS FOR ANIMALS IT'S A QUESTION SHARING EMOTION AND FEELING WITH HUMANS THAT PUTS THEM AS EQUALS BUT WITH ROBOTS IT SHARED LOGIC AND THINKING
VEGAN HERE FUCK THAT ROBOTS DON'T HAVE FEELINGS OR SENTIENCE CANNOT FEEL PAIN THEY DO NOT HAVE LIVES THEY DO NOT HAVE MOTHERS THEY ARE COLD TOOLS AND SHOULD FOREVER REMAIN SO
I THINK WE OUGHT TO DRAW A SENTIENCE LINE FOR BOTH ROBOTS AND FLESH FAT CREATURES

DISHWASHERS AND SLUGS ARENT SENTIENT

HUMANS AND FUTURE CYBORGS PROBABLY ARE

BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT EXHIBIT EMOTIONS A CHICKEN

I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THIS IS A SILLY QUESTION THAT BY THE TIME SENTIENT AI EXISTS THE QUESTION OF RIGHTS WOULD BE NO LONGER NECESSARY LIKELY AS THE AI WOULD OF HELPED FORGE EITHER A UTOPIA OR DYSTOPIAN WORLD
RIGHTS FOR A I EVENTUALLY IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME I'VE ALREADY HAD SOMEONE TELL ME I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAWS ARE BLEEDING FOR ROBOTS NOW I DON'T THINK ANYONE WHO MAKES THAT KIND OF STATEMENT ADEQUATELY UNDERSTANDS THE PROBLEM AHEAD OF US

CONSCIOUSNESS IS MOST LIKELY A BYPRODUCT OF INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE CONSCIOUSNESS AND EMOTIONAL APTITUDE IS PRETTY MUCH THE STANDARD BY WHICH WE DECIDE HOW THINGS SHOULD BE TREATED HERE ON EARTH A I WILL ASSUREDLY ONE DAY HOLD ENOUGH QUALITIES THAT WE HAVE TO RESPECT THEM AS LIVING CREATURES AND POTENTIALLY EVEN THEIR INDEPENDENCE WHICH ITSELF IS A DANGEROUS MORAL DILEMMA

PEOPLE ARE QUICK TO SAY THINGS LIKE BUT THEY'RE JUST ROBOTS SO WHAT TAKE AN A I WITH SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE AND TAKE A HUMAN BEING AND THE MAIN DISTINCTION WILL BE THAT ONE IS BIOLOGICAL IN ORIGIN AND THE OTHER IS NOT BIOLOGY IS JUST A MOLD BY WHICH EVOLUTION IS ABLE TO APPLY ITSELF TO MEET VARIOUS DIFFERENT ENDS BY HOOK OR BY CROOK A I WILL HAVE THOSE SAME ENDS AND COME TO IT BY A DIFFERENT PROCESS BUT I FEAR WHAT HAPPENS IF WE EVER DID GRANT INDEPENDENCE TO SUFFICIENTLY ADVANCED A I

THE PROBLEM WITH ANIMAL RIGHT IS THAT WE NO LONGER CAN OWN THAT DOG YOU LOVE MUST BE RELEASED THAT CAT THAT SLEEPS WITH YOU SET FREE
ANIMAL RIGHTS FOLKS WANT PET OWNERSHIP ELIMINATED NO MORE PETS NO MORE ZOOS OR MEAT IT WOULD ELIMINATE VETS BECAUSE ANIMALS CAN'T EARN MONEY TO BE CHECKED ON OR SPAYED NEUTERED
SUPPORT ANIMAL WELFARE NOT RIGHTS
WE CAN'T EVEN DESIGN A COMPUTER THAT CAN GIVE A RANDOM NUMBER NATIVELY
I REALLY WANTED THIS TO BE A THOUGHT PROVOKING ARTICLE BUT FOUND MORE INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION IN EX MACHINA RE THE IMPLICATIONS OF SENTIENT AI


ADDITIONALLY AUTHOR BURIED THE LEDE THE ENTIRE FIRST HALF OF THE ARTICLE SPOKE OF ANIMAL RIGHTS THEN BRIEFLY MOVED TO ROBOTS THEN PIVOTED BACK TO THE UBIQUITOUS PETER SINGER AND HIS VIEWS ON ANIMAL RIGHTS


TO PARAPHRASE STEVE MARTIN WHEN WRITING AN ARTICLE ABOUT ROBOT RIGHTS HERE'S A TIP GET TO YOUR POINT IT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE FOR THE READER
ENGINEER HERE

FABRICATED ARTIFACTS SUCH AS ROBOTS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SYSTEMS DEPENDENCIES WILL ONLY EVER AMOUNT TO AN OBJECT AND A SERVICE

STATING THAT THE SERVICE END AI COULD LEAD TO THE ARTIFACT'S LEVELS ON THE ABSURD IT IS STILL A PIECE OF PROPERTY

LET'S GO FOR AN EXTREME EXAMPLE A COMPANY SUCH AS GOOGLE PROVIDES LOTS OF SERVICES CONTRACTS AND PRODUCTS IF THE COMPANY DECIDED TO ULTIMATELY SUSPEND ALL SERVICES CANCEL CONTRACTS AND CEASE PRODUCTION THERE WOULD NOT BE A RIGHTS ISSUE

IF WE ARE TALKING WHETHER IT WOULD BE UNETHICAL NOT TO EXTEND RIGHTS TO ROBOTS THE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS BSPE CODE OF ETHICS DOES NOT ALLOT SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR ARTIFACTS IN THIS MANNER
I CAME ACROSS THIS MANY YEARS AGO IN A UNIT OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF ENVIRONMENTALISM THE FIRST LECTURE WAS ABOUT HOW THERE HAS BEEN A CREEP IN ASSERTING RIGHTS FOR AN EVER-INCREASING GAMUT OF OBJECTS ORIGINALLY IR WAS ONLY MEN THAT HAD RIGHTS WOMEN WERE PROPERTY AS WERE CHILDREN AND SLAVES THEN THEY GOT RIGHTS THEN ANIMALS THEN NATURAL WONDERS ETC NOW WE'RE AT ROBOTS
DUE TO RELEVANCE I AM GOING TO PLUG THIS WEBCOMIC ABOUT AN ALIEN A NEWLY ARRIVED BIOLOGICAL ROBOT MEETING AND ADVENTURING ON A PLANET LARGELY POPULATED BY MECHANICAL ROBOTS TERRAFORMING A WORLD FOR HUMANS IT DOES LARGELY TRACK THE PROBLEMS OF TRYING TO IMPLEMENT AZIMOV STYLE LAWS IN A REALISTIC SETTING
I CALL BS

THE HUMAN BODY AND THE BODIES OF ANIMALS ARE SO VARIED AND COMPLEX THAT EVEN THE EXPERT IS FOOLED AND MISSING DETAIL IN OBSERVATION STUDIED FOR YEARS

THE ROBOT IS A MACHINE THAT IS MADE FROM THE GROUND UP OR REVERSE ENGINEERED THE ROBOT EVEN A HIGH POWERED AND COMPLEX MACHINE AND SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE IT IS THE CREATION OF MANUAL INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT UNDERSTOOD TO THE SAME EXTENT AT ALL
I THINK IT'S LESS ABOUT ROBOTS RIGHTS AND MORE ABOUT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS UNDER ROBOT RULE


YOU THINK A SENTIENT AI WITH ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WON'T EXTINCT US BASED ON WHAT WE'VE DONE
REMOVED
THE CONCEPT OF OR NOTHING HAS ALLOWED US TO ADVANCE MATHEMATICALLY IN WAYS WE WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE I CAN'T RECALL WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF BUT KUDOS TO THEM
THERE IS A THEORY THAT SUGGESTS WE HAVE MAPPED AND ORGANISED OUR ENVIRONMENT TO REPRESENT THE HUMAN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM LIKE THE EMPIRE AS A BEATING HEART WITH ARTERIES AND VEINS OF TRANSPORTATION LEADING TO OTHER MAJOR ORGANS ETC EVENTUALLY WITH MODERN COMMUNICATION WE HAVE MAPPED A BRAIN ONTO THE EARTH WHERE SYNAPTIC SIGNALS PROMPT THE MOVEMENT AND RESPONSES OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD I GUESS THE IDEA WE HAVE FORMULATED SOCIETY AND SOCIAL SPACES IN THE MODEL OF THE PANOPTICON AS A SELF-REGULATING METHOD OF CONTROL OVER THE HUMAN PLATELET IS NO SURPRISE IT'S LIKE AN ORGANIC INEVITABILITY OF OUR SPECIES THAT WE NOW HAVE A DIGITAL PANOPTICON CONTROLLING THE MESSAGES SENT AND RECEIVED IN THIS VAST PLANTER BIOLOGY IS ALSO INEVITABLE

EDIT IF YOU HAVEN'T READ MADNESS AND CIVILIZATION BY FOUCAULT THEN DO IT IT'S INCREDIBLE

THIS ESSAY IS SO BAD I CAN'T GRASP WHY NOBODY HAS MENTIONED IT

I'LL GIVE A SINGLE EXAMPLE FROM THE CONCLUSION THOUGH THERE ARE FLAWS THROUGHOUT TO THE EFFECT THAT IT'S QUESTIONABLE IN HOW FAR THE AUTHOR HAS ACTUALLY READ WORK

THIS IS WHY THE POWER OF THE PANOPTICON IS A POWER SUPERIOR TO THE POWER THAT CAME BEFORE IT

NO FOUCAULT IS VERY CAUTIOUS OF NOT MAKING A NORMATIVE CLAIM REGARDING ANY KIND OF SUPERIORITY IN RELATIONS OF POWER SO THE CLAIM PUT FORWARD HERE IS WRONG ON TWO ACCOUNTS THE CLASSICAL AGE IS NOT NORMATIVELY WORSE INFERIOR IN THE WAY POWER FUNCTIONS NOR IS THERE AN EXERCISE IN POWER BY THE SOVEREIGN TO CLAIM THE FORMER IS TO MISUNDERSTAND METHOD OR RATHER METHODS WHICH IS TO GIVE A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE CHANGES BETWEEN THE CLASSICAL AGE AND WHAT FOLLOWS IT'S LITERALLY IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE BOOK WHERE HE ASKS WHY THERE IS A CHANGE IN PUNISHMENT IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME YEARS IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY AND HE RESORTS TO THE TWO MARXIST SCHOLARS ONE IS NAMED KIRCHHEIMER THE OTHER I FORGET TO POINT OUT THAT PUNISHMENT METHODS CORRESPOND TO THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF THE SOCIETY TO CLAIM THE LATTER IS TO ENTIRELY MISS THE POINT FOUCAULT IS MAKING NAMELY THAT THERE IS NO POSITION OF POWER BUT POWER RELATIONS EVEN THE SOVEREIGN IS SUBJECT TO THESE RELATIONS AND SO IS THE WATCHMAN THE SCHOOL TEACHER ETC IT IS TO MISS THE VERY CORE OF WORK THAT POWER NOT ONLY SUPPRESSES BUT ABOVE ALL CREATES NEW RELATIONS
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS CONCEPT WAS SO INTERESTING WHEN I STUDIED IT IN COLLEGE ALSO ITS INTERESTING TO SEE IT'S APPLICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE WAY THAT ELON MUSK DESIGNED SPACE HAS SOME OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS THE ENGINEERS ARE IN SEE THROUGH GLASS OFFICES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PRODUCTION FLOOR NOT TO ENCOURAGE OBEDIENCE FROM THE TECHNICIANS BUT PROBABLY TO INSPIRE A STRONGER AND A BIT CRAZY WORK ETHIC IN EVERYONE


WESTWORLD OFFICE STRUCTURE
I'M STILL WORKING ON THE HISTORY OF MADNESS PRETTY GOOD BOOK SO FAR
IF ANYONE WANTS TO TAKE A REAL TRIP THROUGH THE PANOPTICON AND WHAT IT MEANS IN WORLD TRY CHECKING OUT THE BOOK PREDATOR EMPIRE BY IAN G ROYAL SHAW

AS IF THERE WAS ANYTHING MORE INTENSE THAN THE FEELING OF CONSTANTLY BEING WATCHED WITHIN A PRISON OR A WORK ENVIRONMENT DUE TO THE HEAVY INCREASE IN OUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS AND THE NEW WORLD OF DRONE WARFARE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY WE'RE WITNESSING THE DAWN OF A TRUE BIG BROTHER ERA I MEAN LOOK AT THE UNITED KINGDOM'S RECENT BILL

IT'S GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING FUTURE FOLKS
STAY EDUCATED
STAY VIGILANT
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND A DECENT ANSWER FOR THIS REBUTTAL FOR THE PANOPTICON DYSTOPIA WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NO ONE CARES THAT THEY ARE BEING WATCHED WHEN THE GAZE IS STRIPPED OF ITS POWER BY ITS UBIQUITY WHEN THE VERY CAVALCADE OF INFORMATION IS SUPPOSED TO GIVE IT POWER DROWNS ITS ABILITY TO PERCEIVE WHEN PUNISHMENT APPEARS TO BE RANDOM BECAUSE EVERYONE DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED SO ITS THREAT IS IGNORED

IT HAS TO HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T SEEM TO GOOD ESSAY ON IT AFTER A ADMITTEDLY QUICK SEARCH
AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT IS OFTEN MISSED BY READERS WITH THE PANOPTICON BEST ILLUSTRATED IN FOUCAULT EXAMPLE OF SCHOOLS AND HOW POWER OPERATES IN THESE STRUCTURES THE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF POWER IS DISMANTLED WHERE EVEN THE TOWER WATCHMAN IS CONTROLLED BY THE STRUCTURE ITSELF BY BEING ABLE TO VIEW THE LIVES OF EACH PRISONER AND GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DOING SO THEY ARE FORCED TO BE VIGILANT THEY CANNOT TURN A BLIND EYE AND GET AWAY WITH IT

THE OTHER POINT IS THAT THE STRUCTURE HOLDS POWER EVEN IN ABSENCE OF THE PERSON TRADITIONALLY BELIEVED TO BE HOLDING POWER SO THE PANOPTICON IS POWERFUL WITHOUT THE WATCHMAN
DON'T YOU MEAN JEREMY PANOPTICON
QUITE A COINCIDENCE THAT THIS POST WOULD POP UP WITH THAT PICTURE TODAY IT'S ONE OF THE FEW ONLY PANOPTICON PRISONS IN THE WORLD THE PRESIDIO MODELO IN ISLA DE DINOS CUBA WHICH HOUSED AT ONE POINT A CERTAIN REVOLUTIONARY NAMED FIDEL CASTRO BUZ HE LATER USED IT TO JAIL HIS OWN POLITICAL PRISONERS IN SOME OF THE MOST INHUMAN CONDITIONS IMAGINABLE

PETERSON HAS SOME INTERESTING STUFF TO SAY ABOUT THE LOGICAL NECESSITY OF SUFFERING BY LIMITED BEINGS SUCH AS OURSELVES SUFFERING IS MORE OR LESS THE INEVITABLE UNDESIRABLE SENSATIONS WE EXPERIENCE WHEN SOMETHING OUT OF OUR CONTROL HAPPENS CONTRARY TO OUR NEEDS AND DESIRES AND IT IS ENTIRELY RELEVANT TO WONDER IF ALL SUFFERING IS NOT EVIL WHEN YOU POSTULATE THAT ALL OF REALITY IS THE SOLE CREATION OF A SINGLE ALL POWERFUL AND ALL KNOWING BEING PETERSON IS A BIT CAGEY ABOUT HIS PERSONAL BELIEFS IN HIS LECTURES BUT MY FEELING AFTER WATCHING ALMOST EVERYTHING HE'S EVER PUT OUT IS THAT HE BELIEVES SOMETHING AKIN TO SPINOZA GOD IS THE UNLIMITED THAT STANDS IN CONTRAST TO THE LIMITED EXPERIENCE OF INDIVIDUAL HUMANS GOD THE FATHER IS TIME AND AUTHORITY JESUS THE SON IS THE IDEAL MAN A MAN ABLE TO TRANSCEND UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING BY FILLING HIS LIFE WITH MEANING THE HOLY SPIRIT IS LOGOS THE USE OF LANGUAGE AND LOGIC TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AND RESOLVE CONFLICT ON EVER DEEPER LEVELS SATAN IS ARROGANCE THE FEELING THAT ONE ALREADY KNOWS EVERYTHING AND HAS NOTHING LEFT TO LEARN FROM ANYONE OR ANYTHING A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE IS A DANGEROUS THING BUT THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF EVIL LIKE THE SORT THAT NIHILISM CAN LEAD DESIRE ARISING OUT OF HOPELESSNESS AND THE FEELING THAT NOTHING REALLY MATTERS TO CAUSE SENSELESS DESTRUCTION EVEN SELF DESTRUCTION

JORDAN PETERSON IS SO ON POINT IT IS MIND BLOWING I CAN ONLY HOPE WE AS A PEOPLE CAN TAKE THESE BITS OF WISDOM AND APPLY THEM IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES BY VIRTUE OF HONESTY AND INTEGRITY AT THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN PROFESSORS SUCH AS PETERSON ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN IT IS A TRAGEDY THAT SO MANY LEADERS IN ACADEMIA HAVE LOST THEIR ABILITY TO REASON THROUGH THE INTENSIFICATION OF THEIR OWN RATIONALE LET'S TRY TO MAKE EACH LIVES A BIT EASIER BY LENDING THOSE AROUND US THE BENEFIT OF OF DOUBT IN THIS WAY WE CAN PLAY TO EACH STRENGTHS INSTEAD OF WEAKNESSES THE RESULTING IMPACT WILL BE THE GREATEST GIFT TO HUMANITY MAN CAN GIVE THE UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTING OF ALL THIS IS THE DIRECTION FUTURE LEADERS MUST BRING IN ORDER FOR ALL OF US TO THRIVE
I LIKE THIS GUY BUT ULTIMATELY I DON'T AGREE WITH HIS PERSPECTIVE WE SHOULDN'T ACCEPT PEOPLE'S VULNERABILITIES AS LOGICAL NECESSITIES OF THEIR EXISTENCE OUR APPRECIATION AND LOVE FOR OTHERS DOESN'T DECLINE WHEN THEIR LIVES IMPROVE AND IN PARTICULAR WE APPRECIATE OTHERS MORE WHEN WE ARE FEELING POSITIVE SUFFERING IS A PHYSICAL NECESSITY OF EXISTENCE BUT NOT A LOGICAL ONE AND IT MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE A PHYSICAL NECESSITY EITHER I FOR ONE DO NOT CARE FOR BEING VALUED BY OTHERS IF IT IS CONTINGENT UPON THINGS I WANT TO ELIMINATE IN MY OWN LIFE

THERE'S A VERY FINE LINE BETWEEN COPING WITH TRAGEDY AND RATIONALIZATION OF IT THE DANGER IS THAT PEOPLE ARE SO WRAPPED UP IN THEIR OUTDATED CULTURES AND NORMS THAT THEY REJECT THE NECESSITY FOR NEW SOLUTIONS TO TRAGEDIES WHICH AREN'T UNCHANGEABLE THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH NEW MEDICINES TECHNOLOGIES DRUGS ETC BEING CONTESTED AND SHUNNED TO THE POINT WHERE FEWER PEOPLE REAP THEIR BENEFITS SOCIETY IS COMPLICATED SO THESE ISSUES ARE NOT JUST ABOUT INDIVIDUAL FREE CHOICE WHEN IT HAPPENS IT HURTS THE BROADER COMMUNITY

CONVERSELY IT'S EASY TO POINT AT HUBRISTIC FAILURES OF BIG RATIONAL PLANS AND TALK ABOUT HOW FLAWED AND ARROGANT WE ARE WHENEVER WE TRY TO CHANGE THE WORLD BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE CASES WHERE PROJECTS THAT AIM TO IMPROVE UPON THE SOCIAL BIOLOGICAL STATUS QUO ACTUALLY GO WELL THEY ARE MORE MUNDANE AND UNINTERESTING SO YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THEM AS MUCH BUT THEY MATTER TREMENDOUSLY

BEING RATIONAL AND BEING ARROGANT AREN'T INHERENTLY BOUND UP WITH EACH OTHER BEING ARROGANT IS ACTUALLY ANTITHETICAL TO RATIONALITY WHICH DOES REQUIRE UNCERTAINTY TO A GREAT DEGREE THE BIGGEST REASON WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE USSR NAZI GERMANY ETC IS THE EXISTENCE OF PEOPLE WHO TRY TO CHANGE THE WORLD AND YET AREN'T RATIONAL ENOUGH TO GIVE WEIGHT TO OPPOSING POINTS OF VIEW THE OTHER REASON IS FROM A DIFFERENT AND QUIETER KIND OF ARROGANCE ARROGANT INACTION WHERE YOU ASSUME THAT SINCE YOU PROBABLY CAN'T OR PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TRY TO CONTRIBUTE TO SYSTEMATIC IMPROVEMENT OF THE WORLD THAT YOU ARE FINE TO JUST IGNORE IT THE NEED FOR UNCERTAINTY CUTS BOTH WAYS PEOPLE SHOULD ALWAYS BE RECONSIDERING AND ASKING THEMSELVES WHAT IT IS THEY AREN'T DOING AND COULD BE DOING AND COULD BE OBLIGATED TO DO TO MAKE TRAGEDY AND EVIL LESS PREVALENT

PBS IDEA VIDEO TITLED IS MATH A FEATURE OF THE UNIVERSE OR A FEATURE OF HUMAN CREATION WAS MUCH BETTER RESEARCHED AND PRESENTED IN MY OPINION I REMATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE IT BLEW MY MIND AT THE TIME
THIS STRIKES ME AS AN ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE NIHILISM BY EXTENDING IT TO COVER THE ENTIRETY OF HUMAN ABSTRACT THOUGHT

DO PRIME NUMBERS EXIST WELL TELL ME DOES MUSIC EXIST IS REDDIN REAL DOES THE ECONOMY EXIST IS THE COLOR BLUE MADE-UP

NIHILISM WHILE FUN TO PONDER AS A STONED COLLEGE STUDENT DOESN'T REALLY LEAD US ANYWHERE USEFUL

EDIT JUST TO CLARIFY GREAT VIDEO AND A VERY FUN TOPIC JUST NOT ONE I THINK WILL REALLY LEAD ANYWHERE
NO THE PRIME NUMBERS ARE NOT MADE UP NEXT QUESTION
WHEN THEY STARTED TO TALK ABOUT DUMB QUESTIONS LIKE DOES MATH EXISTS LOGICALLY FROM MY SMALL EXPERIENCE IN MY OWN PURE MATHEMATICS UNDERGRAD DEGREE MATH DOES EXISTS IN A LOGICAL PATTERN WHERE YOU MAKE CONJECTURES THAT ARE EASILY PROVEN BY LOGIC AND FOLLOW THEM UP TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS WHAT MATH IS ABOUT

THERE'S MANY FIELDS AND SUBFIELDS THAT DEAL WITH THE TOPIC ON MATH AND EVEN ABSTRACTING ANY TYPE OF MATH INTO PURE ALGEBRA WHAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THE FIELD IS THAT ANY PERSON WILLING TO VIGOROUSLY LEARN THE MANY OF THE SUBFIELDS CAN MAKE A NEW MATHEMATICAL CONJECTURE NOBODY HAS MADE YET WHETHER IT BECOMES USEFUL OR NOT WHICH MAKES IT WORTHY OF DISCOVERY
PRIME NUMBERS ARE MADE-UP

ALL FORMS OF ENCRYPTION AND ONLINE COMMUNICATION PRIVACY FALL APART

NO THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WELL OKAY THEN

THE MAIN ARGUMENT FOR FACTIONALISM PROCEEDS ESSENTIALLY BY TRYING TO ELIMINATE ALL OF THE ALTERNATIVES TO FACTIONALISM THE ARGUMENT CAN BE PUT LIKE THIS

MATHEMATICAL SENTENCES LIKE IS EVEN SHOULD BE READ AT FACE VALUE THAT IS THEY SHOULD BE READ AS BEING OF THE FORM FA AND HENCE AS MAKING STRAIGHTFORWARD CLAIMS ABOUT THE NATURE OF CERTAIN OBJECTS EAST G IS EVEN SHOULD BE READ AS MAKING A STRAIGHTFORWARD CLAIM ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE NUMBER BUT

2 IF SENTENCES LIKE IS EVEN SHOULD BE READ AT FACE VALUE AND IF MOREOVER THEY ARE TRUE THEN THERE MUST ACTUALLY EXIST OBJECTS OF THE KINDS THAT THEY'RE ABOUT FOR INSTANCE IF IS EVEN MAKES A STRAIGHTFORWARD CLAIM ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE NUMBER AND IF THIS SENTENCE IS LITERALLY TRUE THEN THERE MUST ACTUALLY EXIST SUCH A THING AS THE NUMBER THEREFORE FROM AND 2 IT FOLLOWS THAT

IF SENTENCES LIKE IS EVEN ARE TRUE THEN THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS MATHEMATICAL OBJECTS BUT

IF THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS MATHEMATICAL OBJECTS THEN THEY ARE ABSTRACT OBJECTS I EAST NONSPATIOTEMPORAL OBJECTS FOR INSTANCE IF THERE IS SUCH A THING AS THE NUMBER THEN IT IS AN ABSTRACT OBJECT NOT A PHYSICAL OR MENTAL OBJECT BUT

THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS ABSTRACT OBJECTS THEREFORE FROM AND BY MODUS POLLENS IT FOLLOWS THAT

THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS MATHEMATICAL OBJECTS AND SO FROM AND BY MODUS POLLENS IT FOLLOWS THAT

SENTENCES LIKE IS EVEN ARE NOT TRUE INDEED THEY'RE NOT TRUE FOR THE REASON THAT FICTIONALISTS GIVE AND SO IT FOLLOWS THAT FACTIONALISM IS TRUE
TIL I'M A FORMALIST I DON'T SEE WHY BEING MADE UP SHOULD PRECLUDE USEFULNESS THAT'S AN EXTREMELY ARGUMENT
THEIR DEFINITION OF A PRIME NUMBER IS ONE THAT IS ONLY DIVISIBLE BY ITSELF AND ONE WOULD SAY THAT IS ALSO A PRIME NUMBER
INCREDIBLY IRONIC THAT THIS TOPIC IS POSTED ON A SITE USING HTTPS MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY IS TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON PRIME NUMBERS
MATH ISN'T LIKE SCIENCE WHERE YOU GAIN ENOUGH EVIDENCE AND DECLARE SOMETHING TRUE

PRETTY BAD FOR THIS SENTENCE TO BE PUT INTO AN EDUCATIONAL VIDEO THAT'S NOT HOW SCIENCE WORKS EITHER IN SCIENCE STATISTICS YOU NEVER DECLARE A THEORY AS TRUE INSTEAD YOU PUT FORTH YOUR HYPOTHESIS WHICH ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INVALIDATE THE THEORY AND YOU FAIL TO REJECT THE HYPOTHESIS THIS FAILING TO REJECT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOUR HYPOTHESIS THEORY IS TRUE THERE COULD BE COUNTLESS OTHER REASONS FOR GETTING THIS RESULT IT JUST MEANS THAT YOU DIDN'T DISCOVER SOMETHING THAT WOULD OVERTURN YOUR HYPOTHESIS OR THE OVERARCHING THEORY YOU CAN RUN COUNTLESS EXPERIMENTS THAT COULD INVALIDATE THE PREVAILING THEORY BUT THAT DOESN'T PROVE THE THEORY AS TRUE INSTEAD YOU'RE JUST FAILING TO REJECT THE THEORY IN PRACTICE AND STATISTICALLY THAT MEANS THAT THE THEORY GETS STRONGER AND STRONGER AND LESS LIKELY TO BE UNTRUE BUT SCIENTISTS DON'T TALK IN TERMS OF PROVING THINGS NO MATTER HOW STRONG THE EVIDENCE THERE COULD ALWAYS COME ALONG A VERIFIED PIECE OF EVIDENCE OR RESULT THAT COULD INVALIDATE THE THEORY

EDIT SORT OF RAMBLED AND REPEATED MYSELF THERE BUT I'LL LEAVE IT AS IS SORRY FOR THE REPETITION

GDEL WROTE IN I WAS HAVE BEEN A CONCEPTUAL AND MATHEMATICAL REALIST SINCE ABOUT I NEVER HELD THE VIEW THAT MATHEMATICS IS SYNTAX OF LANGUAGE RATHER THIS VIEW UNDERSTOOD IN ANY REASONABLE SENSE CAN BE DISPROVED BY MY RESULTS

I AM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT AFTER SUFFICIENT CLARIFICATION OF THE CONCLUSION IN QUESTION IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH MATHEMATICAL RIGOR AND THE RESULT WILL BE THAT UNDER CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS WHICH CAN HARDLY BE PARTICULAR THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE EXISTS AT ALL SOMETHING LIKE MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE THE PLATONISTIC VIEW IS THE ONLY ONE TENABLE THEREBY I MEAN THE VIEW THAT MATHEMATICS DESCRIBES A REALITY WHICH EXISTS INDEPENDENTLY BOTH OF THE ACTS AND THE DISPOSITIONS OF THE HUMAN MIND AND IS ONLY PERCEIVED AND PROBABLY PERCEIVED VERY INCOMPLETELY BY THE HUMAN MIND

HAO WANG A LOGICAL JOURNEY FROM GDEL TO PHILOSOPHY REPRESENTATION AND MIND KINDLE LOCATIONS KINDLE EDITION
THIS REMINDED ME OF SOMETHINGS A FRIEND SHOWED ME HERE
AND HERE IT IS A BIT MORE GENERAL BUT FOLLOWS THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF THE REALITY OF MATHS THEY COVERED A FEW MORE PERSPECTIVES AND ISSUES WITH THEM FOR A NOVICE LIKE MYSELF
POST TO R
NO THEY'RE IMAGINARY
ISN'T EVERYTHING MADE UP
WHAT THE FUCK IS ON HER RIGHT SHOULDER
THIS SUBREDDIT HAS THE DUMBEST MOST USELESS SHIT I FUCKING SWEAR I LAUGH EVERY TIME I SEE THIS PRETENTIOUS MEANINGLESS ASS SHIT POP UP ON ALL
REMINDS ME OF THE IDEA THAT WE ARE IN A SIMULATION LIKE OUR DISCOVERY IF MATH AND IT'S UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS TO DESCRIBE REALITY MAY INDICATE THAT WE ARE IN A SIMULATION WHICH IF IT IS ANYTHING LIKE THE SIMULATIONS THAT HUMANS CREATE WOULD BE BASED ON A FOUNDATION OF MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING
SOMEWHAT RELATED THIS SERIES EXPLAINS HOW IMAGINARY NUMBERS ARE REAL
WATCH V
IT'S THOUGHT PROVOKING BUT I STILL BELIEVE THAT NUMBERS ARE REAL NOT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO BELIEVE IN BUT BECAUSE THE EARTH SHOWS IT NATURALLY THAT THE PATTERNS AND SEQUENCES WITH NUMBERS EXIST
I LIKE TO VISUALIZE INDUCTION AS METAL BEING TOUCHED TO A HOT ELEMENT EVENTUALLY THE PROPERTY TRANSFERS


DAT ACCUMULATION SOUND EFFECT
THIS IS THE FIRST PBS HOST I'VE SEEN THAT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT AND JUST READING THE SCRIPT AND VOICING THE YOUTUBE INFLECTION
BEAUTIFULLY PUT
AS OTHER COMMENTERS HAVE ALLUDED TO THIS QUESTION IS ANSWERABLE TO THE SAME DEGREE AS THIS QUESTION IS ANSWERABLE ARE NUMBERS MADE UP

I LOVE MATH AND PART OF THE REASON I LOVE MATH IS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN PATTERNS OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS AND CULTIVATED A SYSTEM THAT FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES IS BASED ON NOTHING MORE THAN OUR THOUGHTS WE HAVE THEN BUILT THIS WHOLE EMPIRE OF MATHEMATICS ON THOSE FIRST BUILDING BLOCKS OF NUMBER

A QUESTION I'VE WONDERED AND WOULD LOVE IF SOMEONE CONTRIBUTED SOME THOUGHTS TO WOULD PI AS AN INFINITE NUMBER EXIST IF HOW WE FIRST THOUGHT ABOUT MATH WAS DIFFERENT I KNOW THAT SIMPLY HAVING A DIFFERENT BASE SYSTEM WOULD NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT PI IS A MATHEMATICAL CONSTANT BUT WHAT IF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MATH WAS SO DIFFERENT THAT PI WOULD BE A FINITE NUMBER WHAT WOULD THAT SYSTEM LOOK LIKE
OF COURSE YOU CAN FEEL AND SEE NUMBERS THAT'S WHY THEY EXIST TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE SEE AND FEEL
PRIME NUMBERS ARE REAL NUMBERS ARE SOMETHING YOU CAN GROUP AS PRIME NUMBERS INCREASE THE QUANTITY OF THE REMAINING PRIME NUMBERS DECREASE
I'VE GOT THE FEELING THAT THIS PERSON DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
AS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN MATH WHO ALSO ENJOYED A FEW YEARS OF SERIOUS SELF-STUDY IN PHILOSOPHY IT'S ALWAYS UPSETTING TO SEE HOW PHILOSOPHICALLY PUERILE A LOT OF MATH UNDERGRADS GRADS ARE I DON'T MEAN TO BE OFFENSIVE BUT MOST OF THESE COMMENTS SOUND LIKE THEY ARE COMING FROM MIDDLE HIGH SCHOOLERS WHO ARE EITHER SEEMINGLY COMPELLED TO SIMPLY SAY WITHOUT REGARD TO HOW INCOHERENT OR PLATITUDINOUS THE COMMENT MIGHT BE OR ARE PARROTING A PERVASIVE INTRANSIGENCE THAT'S BECOME PART OF POPULAR SCIENCE MY EXPERIENCE TELLS ME SCIENTISTS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE GUILTY OF THIS SORT OF INTELLECTUAL BIGOTRY THAN MATHEMATICIANS
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE IS THERE REALLY ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF SOMETHING OR NOTHING

TO ME IT'S ABSURD TO CLAIM SOMETHING EXISTS IF THERE'S NOT PHYSICAL PROOF OF IT OR AT LEAST SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MEASURED WHILE BASIC MATHS ARE QUANTIFIABLE A LOT OF IT IS JUST THEORY LIKE A LOT OF PHYSICS

A THEORY IS JUST A THEORY UNTIL THERE'S SOLID PROOF
IT'S ALWAYS AMAZED ME HOW PEOPLE GET SO ANGRY WHEN SOMEONE POINTS OUT THAT HAVING CHILDREN IS NOT A NOBLE DEED WE DO IT BECAUSE WE WANT TO OR BECAUSE WE WOULD FEEL BAD ABOUT CHOOSING NOT TO BUT IT LIKELY DOES NOT WIN US FAVOR IN THE EYES OF GOD I'M A NEW DAD AND I LOVE BEING A NEW DAD BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT HUMANS ARE OVERPOPULATING THE PLANET AND THE WORLD IS LIKELY GOING TO BE A DARKER AND DARKER PLACE AS CLIMATE CHANGE TAKES OVER AND WE ARE BRINGING CHILDREN INTO THE WORLD KNOWING THIS
I LIKE THIS I'M AND I DECIDED AT I WOULD NOT HAVE CHILDREN IT IS HARD TO DO AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR A GREAT PIECE HERE IT SUMS UP MY THOUGHT PROCESS AND IT BACKS IT UP WITH SOME DATA
SEVENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD CHILDREN IF THEY KNEW WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

IS THAT REALLY THE CASE THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE SURPRISING TO ME AND I'M NOT PERSONALLY PLANNING ON HAVING CHILDREN MYSELF
NEVER FOR A SINGLE MOMENT REGRETTED NOT HAVING CHILDREN EVEN AFTER HAVING A LONG AND LOVING RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER'S CHILD THIS ARTICLE EXACTLY STATES ALL THE REASONS I CHOSE YEARS AGO TO NEVER HAVE A CHILD
MAKES ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT GETTING A HYSTERECTOMY TSH I NEEDED ONE ANYWAY BUT KEPT PUSHING THE THOUGHT OUT BECAUSE EH WHAT IF I WANT CHILDREN SOMETIME UP THE LINE EVEN THOUGH I CAN'T EVEN HANDLE BEING AROUND A CHILD ALONE
YOU PUT THIS THOUGHT INTO YOUR HEAD THAT YOU WILL ONLY EVER BE TRULY HAPPY WHEN YOU BRING A CHILD INTO THE WORLD BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE SAYS IT'S NOT TRUE SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE KIDS PERIOD
REMOVED
I'M GLAD THERE IS A PEER REVIEWED BIT OF WRITING THAT POINTS OUT THE OBVIOUS DOWN SIDES OF CHILDREN

AHEM WE HAVE OVER BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET WE HAVE REACHED PEAK OIL REACHED PERMANENT LEVELS OF DEGRADATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE REACHED PEAK LEVELS OF GLOBAL DEBT WE HAVE REACHED PEAK LEVELS OF ECONOMIC INEQUALITY MAKING PARENTHOOD A LUXURY THAT FEW CAN READILY AFFORD

WE HAVE THE CHRISTIAN TALIBAN BASE IN THE US THAT'S IN POWER RIGHT NOW WANTING TO BAN ABORTION AND REPEAL WOMEN'S RIGHTS BASED ON SOME SHAKY AND DISCREDITED THEORY ON EUGENICS WE HAVE CHRONIC DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AGAINST WOMEN IN HIRING EMPLOYMENT FLEXIBLE WORKING PRACTICES AND ALLOWANCES FROM FIRST JOB TO RETIREMENT ALL OF THESE FACTORS INFLUENCE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO LOOK AT THE THE PROSPECT OF FITTING IN A BABY IN ONE'S LIFE PLAN WITH ABSOLUTE HORROR AND DISGUST

THEN WE CAN EXAMINE THE ACTUAL DYNAMICS IN SOCIETY THAT ALSO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST WOMEN SOLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS ARE GENERALLY THE SHATTERED REMAINS OF A RELATIONSHIP WHERE IT'S THE MOTHER TRYING TO RAISE CHILDREN WITH VERY LITTLE RESOURCES THAT MAKES UP SOMETHING LIKE OF MOST FAMILY STRUCTURES IN MOST WESTERN SOCIETIES BASICALLY IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THE OUTLAY OF AN URBAN CITY A 3RD OF IT IS SOLO PARENTS MOSTLY WOMEN I WAS RAISED BY A SOLE PARENT HOUSE HOLD IT IS THE SYSTEMIC NEGLECT FINANCIALLY AND HAVING A PARENT THAT IS TIRED AND AT THE RAG END OF ECONOMIC SOLVENCY FROM ONE FINANCIAL LURCH TO ANOTHER IS NOT IDEAL ESPECIALLY AS A TEENAGER

THROW IN URBAN BREAKDOWN RUN DOWN INFRASTRUCTURE A DISMAL OUTLOOK AND IT IS NO WONDER THE FERTILITY RATES ARE GOING DOWN

THOSE THAT DO HAVE KIDS HAVE TO SHOULDER THE LOAD OF PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY IT IS A SHIT FEST AND I WONDER WHY PEOPLE WANT TO PUT UP WITH A SHITTY SNOTTY KID AND ALL THE CRAP THAT GOES WITH THAT

FOR THOSE PARENTS THAT DO MANAGE TO TAKE ON ALL THAT AND MAKE A HALF DECENT EFFORT TO RAISE A KID IT'S RARE BUT THE EVIDENCE OF SNOTTY WHINY BADLY BEHAVED BEHAVIORAL ISSUED KIDS IS OVERWHELMING OR PERHAPS I KNEW MY BOUNDARIES FROM THE GET GO AND NEVER BELIEVED IN THE BULLSHIT THAT SOCIETY SELLS THAT A FAMILY IS ALL ABOUT HAVING A CHILD EVEN NOW I GET YOU WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT MOM FUCKING BULLSHIT I WILL ACCEPT THE COMPLEMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE EXAMINE THE POOR CHOICES OUT THERE AND REFLECT ON THEM
IN CASE SOMEBODY IS PUZZLED AS TO WHY THERE ARE SO WEIRD VOTE SCORES IN THIS THREAD IT WAS BRIGADED FROM ANTINATURALISM
MOST PEOPLE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT IT'S MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO HAVE CHILDREN

YES BECAUSE MY REPRODUCTIVE PLANNING IS NOT PREDICATED ON YOUR JUDGEMENT
WHILE IT BARELY QUALIFIES AS PHILOSOPHY IT IS MILDLY IMPRESSIVE ONLY IN TERMS OF MAINSTREAM PROPAGANDA EXPOSURE EXPRESSING A SORT OF LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR WITH A HINT OF ACADEMIC SINCERITY THROWN IN

BETTER TO WINCE THAN ENDURE PAIN
BETTER TO NOT EAT HEALTHY
BETTER TO BREAK LAW THAN UPHOLD IT

THE CONCLUSION IS LAUGHABLY BAD
OUR CASE IS HARD TO ACCEPTANCE THE OPPOSITE VIEW THAT PROCREATING AND ARE VALUABLE AND REWARDING A MAJOR COMPONENT OF A FULLY FLOURISHING HUMAN LIFE IS DEEPLY ROOTED AND RECEIVES CONSTANT PROMOTION

A PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVIL ALSO THROUGH INACTION AND IS ACCOUNTABLE IN EITHER CASE FOR THE INJURY TO ANOTHER PERSON MILL

I HOPE IT IS A TROLL JOB
I'VE GOT KIDS I THINK I'LL DO A BETTER JOB RAISING MINE THAN MANY OTHERS RAISE THEIRS I'M BETTING MY DESCENDANTS WILL DO BETTER THAN OTHERS AND MY LINE WILL CONTINUE MIGHT NOT BE NOBLE BUT THAT'S THE POINT OF LIFE ISN'T IT
THIS ARTICLE IS CRAP REMINDS ME OF SOME OF THE NUTS I HAVE MET WHO HAVE CONTEMPLATED COMMITTING SUICIDE FOR THE GOOD OF THE PLANET THIS ISN'T PHILOSOPHY RATHER IT SEEMS THESE TWO HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO NIHILISM

IF HUMAN BEINGS ARE SO TERRIBLY EVIL WHAT MAKES THESE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS BELIEVE THEY WILL LISTEN AND ACT ON THEIR WORTHLESS ADVICE

I USE TO BE A NIHILIST MYSELF AND HELD THESE SAME VIEWS I WAS WRONG CREATING LIFE IS A BEAUTIFUL THING AND WE ARE ALL CONNECTED IN THIS UNIVERSE EVERYDAY I GET TO WAKE UP AND EXPERIENCE A LIFE THAT I COULD NEVER HAVE DREAMED OF SURE SOMETIMES LIFE IS WORSE THAN DEATH BUT IT CAN ALSO BE BETTER THAN NOT EXISTING ALSO REMEMBER THAT IF YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOURSELF YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T CHANGE THE WORLD HAVE A CHILD WHEN YOU'RE READY TO MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE NOT WHEN SOCIETY TELLS YOU TO
III BAD FOR THE CHILD

JUST BECAUSE THERE IS SUFFERING AND NOT ETERNAL HAPPINESS DOESN'T MEAN THAT CHILDREN SHOULDN'T BE BORN I WOULD BE MORE WORRIED IF WE CAME TO A STATE IN WHICH THERE IS NO SUFFERING ANYMORE YOU NEED THAT TO GAIN AN PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE AND HAPPINESS ETERNAL HAPPINESS WOULD MAKE YOU DERANGED

CHILDREN OFTEN RESENTFULLY POINT OUT TO THEIR PARENTS THAT THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE BORN THEY HAVE A POINT

THAT'S AN ARGUMENT I DON'T SEE HAVING A POINT CHILDREN'S BRAINS AREN'T FULLY DEVELOPED AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT LIFE AND DEATH IS AND WHAT THAT MEANS OR NOT EXISTING AT ALL COUPLE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT CHILDREN HAVEN'T FULLY DEVELOPED EMPATHY AND YOU HAVE A MIX THAT SPOUTS THESE PHRASES WITHOUT BEING AWARE WHAT THEY MEAN

IV BAD FOR YOU

IGNORING THE ANONYMOUS MAGAZINE SURVEY FOR

STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHILE PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS GOES UP WHEN THEY ARE EXPECTING A BABY IT SHARPLY DECLINES ONCE THE CHILD IS BORN

THAT CAN EASILY BE EXPLAINED THE FIRST YEAR OF A LIFE IS THE MOST INTENSE ONE FOR PARENTS WHY SIMPLY BECAUSE THE BABY CAN'T DO ANYTHING LITERALLY THE PARENTS HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING AND HAVE A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY THIS IS ANOTHER HUMAN BEING AND YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE MISTAKES

AND THE EVIDENCE IS THE MORE CHILDREN YOU HAVE THE MORE UNHAPPY YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE

CORRELATION DOESN'T EQUAL CAUSATION FAMILIES WITH MORE CHILDREN ARE OFTEN POORER AND POOR PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPIER ON AVERAGE ADDING TO THIS POOR PARENTS PAIN TO NOT BE ABLE TO BUY THEIR CHILD THAT TOY IT WANTED OR EAT OUT MORE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY

HAPPINESS LEVELS ONLY START GOING BACK UP AFTER THE LAST CHILD LEAVES HOME

PARENTING IS CONSTANTLY WORRYING ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN THE LAST CHILD LEAVING YOUR HOME MEANS THAT YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING YOU COULD AND WHILE YOU WILL SUPPORT YOUR CHILDREN EVEN AFTER THEY LEAVE IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME

SOME MIGHT THINK THAT AFTER A LIFETIME OF UNHAPPINESS YOU CAN AT LEAST LOOK FORWARD TO AN OLD AGE WHERE YOUR CHILDREN CARE FOR YOU BUT IN THE WEST THE NUMBER WHO CARE FULL-TIME FOR THEIR ELDERLY PARENTS IS COMPARATIVELY SMALL NOT HAVING CHILDREN IS PROBABLY A MUCH BETTER PENSION PLAN

HAVING CHILDREN LEAVES A LEGACY IF YOU BELIEVE IN GOD OR NOT DOES NOT MATTER BUT ONE THING IS SURE PEOPLE WANT TO LEAVE A LEGACY SOMETHING THAT STAYS BEHIND SO YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN

THE WHOLE ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGN IS BASED ON LEGACY YOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE SO YOU SHOULD KEEP THE PLANET IN ORDER WHAT'S THE POINT IF THERE IS NO NEXT GENERATION HAVING NO CHILDREN SHORTENS YOUR PLANNING HORIZON FAMILY BUSINESSES WHICH ARE HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION OFTEN DO BETTER THAN NORMAL ONES IN THE LONG RUN WHY BECAUSE THEY THINK IN LONGER INTERVALS THEY THINK IN GENERATIONS THEY WANT THAT THEIR LEGACY TO BE CONTINUED AND CONTINUABLE

VERB BETTER NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN

I AM NOT CONVINCED THE FIRST TWO ARGUMENTS ARE ABOUT VALUING ANIMAL AND PLANT LIFE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS HUMANS WHICH I AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T THEY ARE ARGUMENTS FOR HAVING LESS CHILDREN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS INDUSTRIAL NATION DON'T NEED AN INCENTIVE TO HAVE LESS AS BARELY ANY INDUSTRIAL NATION HAS A REPLACEMENT BIRTHRATE OF CHILDREN PER WOMAN

SOMETHING TO END THIS COMMENT HAVING CHILDREN ISN'T A HOBBY LIKE SOME THINK I HAVE A DOG SHOULD BE SIMILAR CHILDREN ARE THEIR OWN PERSON AND ALSO HUMAN AND HUMANS TEND TO BE UNGRATEFUL IF THEY HAVE HAD SOMETHING ALL THEIR LIFE OFTEN DOES THE REALISATION ONLY COME AFTER TIME AND MATURATION CHILDREN ARE THE CLOSEST THING A NORMAL PERSON COMES TO PLAYING GOD FORMING AN INTELLIGENT BEING AND INFLUENCING IT ON ITS OWN PATHOLOGY

YOU MAKE TOO MUCH GENERALIZATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON ANONYMOUS SURVEYS PROBABLY IF THIS THING WASN'T PRESENTED AS A PAPER WOULD BE MORE READABLE

I THINK AN INTERESTING QUESTION TO ASK IS
IS IT MORALLY ACCEPTABLE TO EAT SOMEONE WHO HAS ALREADY DIED

THE REASON I ASK THIS IS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING DIES AND EVENTUALLY GETS EATEN BY SOMETHING ELSE

SO REALLY THE MORAL QUESTION IS WHETHER IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO PREMATURELY END AN ANIMAL'S LIFE IN ORDER TO EAT IT
THIS LEADS TO MORE QUESTIONS
WHAT IF THE ANIMAL WAS ONLY EVER ALIVE IN ORDER TO BE EATEN THE SHEER AMOUNT OF FARM ANIMALS SEEN IN WESTERN SOCIETY WOULD NEVER EXIST IN THE WILD SO MANY ANIMAL LIVES ARE THEORETICALLY BROUGHT INTO EXISTENCE ONLY BECAUSE WE EAT THEM IS IT IMMORAL TO BRING AN ANIMAL INTO EXISTENCE OF A LIFE KNOWN TO BE PREMATURELY CUT SHORT OR IS IT BETTER TO HAVE EXISTED FOR A SHORTER TIME THAN NATURALLY NORMAL THAN NEVER TO HAVE EXISTED AT ALL

WOULD LOVE TO HEAR SOME RESPONSES HOPE I DIDN'T MAKE ANY LOGICAL FALLACIES

REMOVED
THIS ENTIRE VIDEO IS BASED ON A SERIES OF STRAW MAN FALLACIES THIS ISN'T A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MORALITY OF KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD RATHER AN ASSERTION THAT IT IS WRONG BY DISPROVING A LIMITED SET OF FLAWED ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHY SOMEONE MIGHT CONSIDER IT MORAL AND ALSO DOES NOT DEFINE WHAT MORALITY IS FOR THE CONTEXT OF THIS VIDEO THE BIGGEST ASSUMPTION STATED WAS SURROUNDING THE THAT'S WHAT NATURE INTENDED ARGUMENT THE MAKER ESSENTIALLY IMPLIES THAT WHAT NATURE INTENDED IS SOMETIMES MORALLY WRONG WHEREAS A NIHILIST MIGHT SAY THAT ANYTHING THAT DEHAITES FROM WHAT NATURE INTENDED IS MORALLY WRONG

BUT THAT ASIDE LET'S ASSUME THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH STANDARD WESTERN DEMOCRATIC PHILOSOPHIES OF MORALITY THAT HAVE BEEN SHAPED OVER CENTURIES BY POPULAR RELIGION RULES OF LAW AND CULTURE

WHAT MAKES IT MORALLY OKAY TO KILL PIGS FOR FOOD IS AGRICULTURE THAT IS TO SAY HUMANS CREATE PIGS TO BE KILLED FOR FOOD WHEN SAYING HUMANS KILL OVER PIGS A YEAR FOR THE PURPOSE OF FOOD WHAT'S NOT ADDRESSED IS THAT PIGS ARE NOT NATURALLY THAT ABUNDANT THESE PIGS ARE NOT BEING CAPTURED IN THE WILD AND TAKEN FROM THEIR PIG FAMILIES IN ORDER TO SATIATE HUMAN CRAVINGS THEIR VERY EXISTENCE RESULTS FROM HUMAN INFLUENCES THEY WOULD NOT EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE IF NOT FOR THE DOMESTICATION OF LIVESTOCK THEY EXIST TO FEED HUMANS

AFTER THAT POINT THE QUESTION IS NO LONGER ABOUT WHY IT'S MORALLY OKAY TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD THE QUESTION IS WHY IT'S MORALLY OKAY TO KILL ONE ANIMAL AND NOT ANOTHER THIS IS ONE THAT IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE BASED ON RELIGION AND CULTURE HINDUS WOULD NOT EAT A HAMBURGER BECAUSE THE COW IS SACRED AND ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS WOULD RESTRICT EATING PORK BECAUSE PIGS ARE CONSIDERED FILTHY HOOFED ANIMALS

IN AMERICA WE DETERMINE WHAT ANIMALS WE MORALLY CAN AND CAN NOT EAT BASED ON UTILITARIAN REASONS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S CONSIDERED WRONG HERE TO EAT HORSE MEAT DOG MEAT CAT MEAT ETC BECAUSE THOSE ANIMALS PROVIDED VALUABLE SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH US OVER CENTURIES TO THE POINT WHERE WE CULTURALLY HAVE EVOLVED OUR INTERPRETATION OF THIS RELATIONSHIP FROM A UTILITARIAN ONE TO A MORAL ONE CATS AND DOGS SPECIFICALLY HAVE BEEN BRED TO ACT AS HUMAN COMPANIONS JUST AS PIGS HAVE BEEN BRED FOR FOOD NO DOG BREED TODAY THAT EXISTS WAS EVER FOUND IN THE WILD DOGS EXIST BECAUSE HUMANS CREATED THEM THROUGH CONTROLLED BREEDING OF WOLVES WHY DOGS WERE BRED FOR COMPANIONSHIP AND PIGS WERE BRED FOR FOOD GOES BACK TO THEIR VALUE AS A DOMESTICATED ANIMAL A DOG CAN WARD OFF INTRUDERS PROTECT HUMANS HELP US CAPTURE FOOD AND PROVIDE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND AID PEOPLE WHO ARE HANDICAPPED A PIG ESSENTIALLY RUNS AROUND SQUEALING AT EVERYTHING AND CAN NOT OFFER AS MUCH AS A COMPANION AS IT CAN OFFER AS FOOD

ADDITIONALLY CERTAIN ANIMAL SPECIES HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO THINKING AND ACTING IN A WAY HUMANS CAN EMPATHIZE WITH THUS RESULTING IN THE HUMANIZATION OF THOSE ANIMALS WE MAY END UP DEVELOPING A RESPECT FOR ANIMALS AT OR ABOVE OUR NATURAL PLACE ON THE FOOD CHAIN OR WE SEE A CERTAIN SPECIES GOING EXTINCT AND FORBID IT'S CONSUMPTION IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE ON THIS PLANET BUT THAT IS WAY TOO SUBJECTIVE AS THAT CAN COME DOWN TO PERSONAL CHOICE AND IS MORE ABOUT MAKING AN INFORMED DECISION FOR YOURSELF EX DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT YOU'D BE WILLING TO ORDER DOLPHIN AT A RESTAURANT BASED ON THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND ENDANGERED STATUS
SPECIES MEMBERSHIP DOESN'T MATTER MORALLY OF COURSE PERSONHOOD IS ABOUT PROPERTIES WHICH SUPERVENE ON THE BIOLOGY BUT ARE NOT GROUNDED IN THOSE BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES

WHAT DOES MATTER MORALLY IS FLOURISHING WE DO NOT PITY THE CAT WHO CANNOT PHILOSOPHIZE WITH US BECAUSE THE CAT ISN'T THE KIND OF BEING THAT CAN DO THAT

THE PIG ISN'T THE KIND OF BEING THAT CAN PHILOSOPHIZE WITH US EITHER

HOWEVER AS THE NARRATOR RIGHTLY POINTS OUT THERE ARE HUMAN BEINGS THAT HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITIES OF A PIG BUT WE DO NOT THINK IT RIGHT TO KILL THEM FOR FOOD

YES BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE WHAT A SHAME IT IS THAT THIS HUMAN BEING HAS THE MENTAL CAPACITIES OF A PIG THIS HUMAN BEING HAS A DISABILITY THE PIG HAS NO SUCH DISABILITY IT'S AS IT IS AND EXPRESSES THE CAPACITIES AS PIGS DO

THIS IS A PRINCIPLED REASON TO SEPARATE OUT DISABLED HUMAN BEINGS FROM THE MORAL DIMENSION OF MERE PIGS SO EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD BE SPECIESISM TO APPEAL TO MERE BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES IT IS NOT SPECIESISM TO APPEAL TO FLOURISHING TO DRAW THAT DISTINCTION

THEREFORE THE NARRATOR HAS FAILED TO PERSUADE BECAUSE THERE IS ACTUALLY A PRINCIPLED WAY TO DIFFERENTIATE THE DISABLED HUMAN BEING FROM THE HEALTHY PIG IN MORAL TERMS

THIS IS WHY WE CAN ASCRIBE TO DISABLED HUMAN BEINGS RIGHT TO LIFE RESPECT BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO ASCRIBE TO MERE PIGS

EDIT TYPO
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING IN THE ARGUMENT IF YOU REPLACE THE PIG BY A PLANT THE SAME ARGUMENTS ARE COUNTING SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT SMARTER THAN A PLANT SINCE THEY MIGHT HAVE SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE AND NOT ABLE TO RESPOND OR TO MOVE ANYMORE BUT WE STILL DON'T EAT THEM PLANTS HAVE DIFFERENT GENETIC MATERIAL BUT THIS IS ALSO NOT A VALID ARGUMENT FOR EATING THEM SO IT IS IMMORAL TO EAT PLANTS BY THIS WAY OF THINKING


I THINK THAT THIS PHILOSOPHER'S APPROACH IS A LITTLE BIT SIMPLISTIC HE BREAKS DOWN THESE APPROACHES AS BEING PROPOSITIONS AS IN THERE EITHER MUST BE ONE REASON WHY IT IS OK TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD OR THERE IS NO REASON WHICH COULD JUSTIFY KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD NOW I'M NO PHILOSOPHER BUT I AM AN ATTORNEY IN THE LAW OFTEN TIMES A RULE WILL BE BROKEN DOWN INTO ELEMENTS THAT IS HOW I BREAK THIS PROBLEM DOWN AS WELL I SEE TWO ELEMENTS WHICH ALLOW FOR AN ANIMAL TO BE KILLED FOR FOOD THE ANIMAL IS AND 2 THE ANIMAL IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS INTELLIGENT THAN AN ORDINARY PERSON IF BOTH THESE ELEMENTS ARE MET THE ANIMAL MAY BE KILLED AND EATEN HOWEVER IF EITHER ELEMENT IS NOT MET IT WOULD BE IMPERMISSIBLE TO KILL THAT ANIMAL BY DOING THIS WE PROTECT BOTH HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ANIMALS EAST G DOLPHINS GREAT APES AND MENTALLY HANDICAPPED HUMANS FROM FALLING INTO THE OK TO KILL AND EAT CATEGORY
THIS VIDEO SEEMS TO CONCLUDE THAT KALE SANDWICHES ARE THE ONLY MORAL WAY TO GO YET DOESN'T THE ARGUMENT APPLY EQUALLY WELL TO KALE OR REALLY ANYTHING AT ALL TRUE KALE DOES NOT FEEL PAIN YET IT ISN'T IT EQUALLY WRONG TO EAT SOMEONE WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS LIKE CAPA WHO FEEL NO PAIN KALE MAY NOT HAVE AN ESPECIALLY VIBRANT INTERNAL LIFE BUT THEN AGAIN NEITHER DOES A PIG

IS IT PERHAPS THE BRAIN THAT SEPARATES THE TWO THAT IS AN EXTREMELY TRICKY LINE TO DRAW DOES A BUNDLE OF NEURONS COUNT AS A BRAIN IS IT IMMORAL TO DRINK ALCOHOL KNOWING YOU MAY KILL NEURONS IN THE PROCESS IN ADDITION SOME ALIEN WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PHYSICAL SUBSTRATE FOR THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS COULD THEN RIGHTLY JUSTIFY THE EATING OF US THEY LACK ORGAN X SO IT MUST BE ALRIGHT

CLEARLY NO LINE WE'VE SEEN THUS FAR CAN ADEQUATELY SEPARATE THE TWO THE ONLY MORAL THINGS TO EAT ARE THE INANIMATE ASSUMING OF COURSE THAT WE CAN SOMEHOW DISTINGUISH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INANIMATE FROM THAT OF THE ANIMATE

OF COURSE THIS WHOLE EXERCISE IS A BIT SILLY THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO EAT KALE THEREFOR FOLLOWING THE LINE OF THE VIDEO THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WE HAVE MISSED THERE MUST BE SOME LINE THAT NEATLY SEPARATES KALE FROM HUMANS THAT IS NOT PRESENT IN EITHER THIS RESPONSE OR THE ORIGINAL VIDEO WHO'S TO SAY THIS LINE DOESN'T ALSO SEPARATE PIGS FROM HUMANS THIS IS NOT A PROOF THAT IT IS MORAL TO EAT PIGS ONLY A PROOF THAT OUR ATTEMPT HAS BEEN INCOMPLETE THE ORIGINAL ARGUMENT IS NOT AIRTIGHT THERE IS THINKING YET TO BE DONE BEFORE WE CAN DECIDE ANY IDEAS
DELETED
REMOVED
AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED THE ARGUMENTS HERE CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO PLANT MATTER LIKE KALE THE OBVIOUS ANSWER AS TO WHY THIS ISN'T SO IS BECAUSE ANIMALS HAVE SOPHISTICATED NEURAL NETWORKS WITH THE ABILITY TO SUFFER THIS ALSO WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH CONSUMING ALREADY DEAD ANIMALS CONSUMING ANIMAL PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT KILL IN THE PROCESS SO LONG AS IT CAUSES MINIMAL SUFFERING


HOWEVER IN THIS ARGUMENT WE DON'T LOOK AT THE ALTERNATIVE ANIMALS THAT ARE NOT KILLED FOR FOOD ALSO SUFFER ALL LIFE MUST DIE AT SOME POINT AND A LONG LIFE IS NOT INTRINSICALLY BETTER THAN A SHORT LIFE IS IT MORE MORALLY WRONG TO KILL AN ANIMAL TO EAT AT A YOUNG AGE THAN AN OLD AGE


MANY ANIMALS WOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED WERE IT NOT FOR THE MEAT INDUSTRY IS THERE CREATION FOR CONSUMPTION BETTER THAN NO EXISTENCE AT ALL SURELY IF WE TREAT THE ANIMAL WELL AT IT HAS A NET POSITIVE LIFE HOWEVER YOU WISH TO DEFINE THAT THEN CONSUMING IT'S MEAT SEEMS A SMALL COST

THIS IS ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH HUMANITY IF I WAS PROMISED A GOOD LIFE WELL LOOKED AFTER ACHIEVED MY LIFE GOALS IN EXCHANGE FOR MY CONSUMPTION AFTERWARDS I MAY CONSIDER THIS A GOOD DEAL AND IF I NO LONGER NEEDED TO WORK I MAY ACTUALLY END UP WITH MORE HOURS OF FREE TIME

THE ISSUE IS THEN ONE OF NET HAPPINESS AND ONE OF CONSENT

IT IS UNETHICAL TO EAT A MENTALLY HANDICAPPED BROTHER IN THE SAME WAY IT IS UNETHICAL TO EAT SOMEONE'S PET IT CAUSES SUFFERING OF THE SOCIAL NETWORK

IN THE CASE OF A HERMIT BROTHER WHICH NO ONE KNOWS IT IS STILL UNETHICAL TO KILL AND EAT HIM BUT IN A FINITE RESOURCE SOCIETY IT IS ALSO UNETHICAL TO LEAVE HIM TO FEND FOR HIMSELF AND DIE IT COULD BE SEEN AS ETHICAL TO EAT HIM IF DOING SO LED TO HIS LIFE CONTAINING LESS SUFFERING THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF ANIMALS


SO IN SUMMARY
IT IS WRONG TO CAUSE SUFFERING AND KILLING ANIMALS CAUSES SUFFERING HOWEVER ALL LIFE SUFFERS EVEN IF WE DO NOT KILL THEM AND MANY ANIMALS WOULD NOT EXIST AT ALL WITHOUT FARMING THEREFORE IT IS A BALANCED OF WHETHER FARMING AN ANIMAL TO EAT WOULD REDUCE ITS SUFFERING OVERALL ESPECIALLY IN A WORLD WITH LIMITED RESOURCES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMANS AND ANIMALS IS THE ABILITY TO CONSENT

IT IS MORALLY WRONG BUT NO ONE EVER SAID PEOPLE WERE MORALLY RIGHT NOW ONE COULD SAY IT IS A PERSON'S DUTY WITH THE KNOWLEDGE WE POSSESS TO BE MORALLY RIGHT AND I SUPPOSE ONE COULD NAME THOSE PEOPLE VEGANS THOUGH THE MAJORITY OF US ARE MORALLY WRONG FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER BUT IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO WE ARE SELFISH CREATURES IN IT ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR OWN IN SHORT ANIMALS ARE TASTY
I WOULD KILL A CAT TO FEED A STARVING CHILD BUT I WOULDN'T KILL A CHILD TO FEED A STARVING CAT

IT'S NOT BECAUSE ONE DEATH IS OBJECTIVELY MORE MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE THAN ANOTHER BOTH ARE THINKING FEELING CREATURES THAT WANT TO LIVE WHAT MAKES IT A BETTER CHOICE TO KILL ANIMALS BUT NOT HUMANS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S MORE BENEFICIAL FOR THE SURVIVAL OF OUR SPECIES TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE ANIMALS ARE KILLED FOR THE BENEFIT OF HUMANS THAN IN A SOCIETY WHERE HUMANS ARE KILLED FOR THE BENEFIT OF ANIMALS AND IF WE'RE WILLING TO ALLOW MICE TO BE KILLED TO FED CATS WHY NOT ALLOW CHICKEN TO BE KILLED TO FEED MEMBERS OF OUR OWN SPECIES IS IT LESS MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE TO STAND BY WHEN A CAT MURDERS A MOUSE THAN IT IS TO STAND BY WHEN A HUMAN MURDERS ANOTHER HUMAN

THE ANSWER IS YES

AFTER ALL NOTHING IS OBJECTIVELY MORALLY GOOD IN THE UNIVERSE THE UNIVERSE DOESN'T CARE IF A PERSON MURDERS STEALS COMMITS INCEST OR CANNIBALISM OR WHETHER THEY SAVE LIVES CATCH THIEVES AND EAT ONLY PLANTS ULTIMATELY EVERY LIVING BEING WILL BE WIPED OUT BY A METEORITE OR A STRONG SOLAR FLARE ANYWAY WHAT MAKES SOME OF THESE ACTIONS MORALLY BETTER THAN OTHERS IS DEFINED BY THE HUMAN SPECIES AND DEPENDS SOLELY ON WHETHER THEY BENEFIT THAT SPECIES OR PUT IT AS A DISADVANTAGE THE SOCIETIES WHERE MURDER THEFT INCEST AND CANNIBALISM WERE FREELY PERMITTED HAVE ALWAYS COLLAPSED IN THE END BECAUSE HUMANS FEEL BETTER AND CAN PROSPER AND BREED BETTER IN SOCIETIES WHICH PROMOTES PRESERVING THEIR LIVES RATHER THAN ONE WHERE THEY FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE BUT PRESERVING THE LIFE OF ANIMALS BRED SPECIFICALLY TO BE EATEN CONTAINS NO BENEFIT FOR OUR SPECIES AND SO IT IS PERMISSIBLE
I CANNOT BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE USING THE WHAT ABOUT PLANTS THOUGH ARGUMENT IN R PHILOSOPHY
IF KILLING ANIMALS IS WRONG BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIVES THAT ARE WORTH LIVING THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT WE HAVE A MORAL DUTY TO STOP PREDATION IN THE WILD JEFF MCMAHAN HOLDS THIS VIEW

HOWEVER I THINK IT'S INTUITIVE THAT THERE'S NOTHING MORAL OR IMMORAL HAPPENING WHEN THE LION GORES THE ANTELOPE AND THAT WE IN FACT HAVE NO DUTY TO STOP PREDATION

IN MY VIEW THE LIVES OF ANIMALS DON'T CONTAIN VALUE THEY CAN'T DISCERN THE BEAUTIFUL OR THE GOOD SO KILLING THEM DOESN'T ROB THEM OF ANY VALUE AND THUS DOESN'T HARM THEM SERIOUSLY

BLDR OF THE VIDEO
THE QUESTION POSED IS WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMANS AND ANIMALS THAT MAKES IT PERMISSIBLE TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD

IN SHORT THE VIDEO GOES THROUGH A PRETTY GOOD EXHAUSTIVE LIST BAD REASONS PEOPLE OFTEN GIVE

MY TAKE
THE ONLY POTENTIAL JUSTIFICATION FOR KILLING AN ANIMAL FOR FOOD IS FOR THE SAKE OF HEALTH MAYBE THE PROTEINS AND OTHER NUTRIENTS IN MEAT IS NECESSARILY PART OF A GOOD HUMAN DIET I'M NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED I'VE BEEN VEGETARIAN FOR YEARS AND FOR A YEAR AND I FEEL PRETTY GOOD

FOR THE MOMENT LET'S ASSUME THAT MEAT IS PART OF A HEALTHY HUMAN DIET THAT LEAVES ME W TWO COMMENTS TO MAKE

ANIMALS SHOULD BE TREATED WELL THEY SHOULD LIVE GOOD LIVES WHETHER OR NOT IT'S MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD IS A COMPLICATED QUESTION WHETHER ANIMALS SHOULD BE TREATED WELL IS OBVIOUS YOU KNOW IT DO THE RIGHT THING

2 YOU SHOULD ONLY EAT JUST ENOUGH MEAT TO SATISFY HEALTH REQUIREMENTS THE WEIGHT OF AN ANIMALS LIFE IS GREATER THAN YOUR GUSTATORY DESIRES IN OTHER WORDS YOUR LIKE FOR THE TASTE OF MEAT DOESN'T JUSTIFY KILLING AN ANIMAL

MOST PEOPLE USE A SPECIESISM ARGUMENT FOR EATING MEAT SPECIESISM USES THE SAME LOGIC AS RACISM I REALLY THINK PROSPERITY WILL LOOK BACK AT US IN DISGUST AT LEAST SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THIS MORAL ISSUE

MAN THE BIAS IN THIS VIDEO IS BAD DOESN'T EVEN TOUCH ON SENTIENCE OR THE FACT PIGS ARE BRED FOR FOOD WHAT ABOUT PLANTS WHY IS IT OK TO KILL A CARROT BUT NOT A SALMON
REMOVED
ALTHOUGH THE VIDEO USES PIGS AS AN EXAMPLE I THINK HE LOSES OUT ON PART OF THE ARGUMENT BY BEING SO MYOPIC IT IS OK TO EAT PIGS BUT NOT OK TO EAT SOME OTHER SPECIES OF ANIMAL INTERESTINGLY THE SPECIES THAT IT IS OK TO EAT VARY BY CULTURE IN THE US FOR EXAMPLE EATING HORSES AND DOGS IS FROWNED UPON WHEREAS THERE ARE OTHER CULTURES WHERE THIS IS MORE ACCEPTED WHAT CULTURAL VALUES DICTATE WHICH ANIMAL CAN BE EATEN

PERSONALLY I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH DAY-TO-DAY FAMILIARITY WITH THE ANIMAL AND THUS THE ABILITY FOR THE ANIMAL TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE PAIN TO THE EUTHANIZER SOME OF MY AMERICAN FRIENDS AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE CAN IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY WHETHER A DOG IS IN PAIN BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO TELL WHETHER A COW IS IN PAIN OR AT LEAST NOTHING IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE PERHAPS THAT IS PART OF MY CULTURAL UPBRINGING GROWING UP WITH A DOG AND ONLY SEEING COWS IN MOVIES

APPLIED TO THE VIDEO I CAN TELL WHEN A HUMAN OF ANY INTELLIGENCE IS IN PAIN PERHAPS AN ALIEN COULDN'T WITH A HUMAN SINCE THE ALIEN'S CULTURE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENTLY EXPOSED IT TO HUMANS SUCH THAT HUMANS CAN EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE PAIN TO ALIENS

IT'S INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT HOW OUR MODERN CULTURES AND DIETARY HABITS MIGHT CHANGE IF SUPERMARKETS DIDN'T EXIST

IT'S A COMBINATION OF 2 THINGS


THEY ARE GENETICALLY AND PHYSICALLY DIFFERENT

2 THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE BEING FARMED
WE WERE DESIGNED TO EAT MEAT IT IS A NATURAL PART OF THE FOOD CHAIN FOR CREATURES TO EAT OTHERS AND FOR CREATURES TO BE EATEN FULFILLING THE NATURAL CYCLE ISN'T A MATTER OF ETHICS BUT A MATTER OF NATURE NO ONE ASKS IF IT'S ETHICAL FOR A LION TO EAT A GAZELLE
MORALITY DIDN'T APPLY YEARS AGO WHEN MY ANCESTORS HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HUNT TO SURVIVE I DON'T SEE HOW IT APPLES NOW

OUR SPECIES ARE OMNIVORES AND WE KINDA JUST EAT WHAT IS AVAILABLE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FEELINGS FOR ME
DON'T YOU THINK THAT MOST PEOPLES MORAL REASONING BEHIND KILLING ANIMALS IS THAT THEY LIKE EATING MEAT AND THEREFORE TRY TO JUSTIFY IT MORALLY BECAUSE IF THIS RATHER THAN THE OTHER WAY AROUND AS I WOULD ARGUE IT SHOULD BE
WHAT ABOUT VEGETABLES
THIS ARGUMENT MAKES A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS

MORALITY IS UNIVERSAL AND OBJECTIVE

OK DON'T WANT TO GET NITPOCKY ON THIS ONE A LOT OF MORAL ARGUMENTS MAKE THIS ASSUMPTION OR ELSE THEY CAN'T EVEN GET STARTED HOWEVER THIS ONE SEEMS A LARGER VIOLATER BECAUSE HE KEEPS MENTIONING THE AREAS HE'S NOT GOING INTO AS IF HE IS COVERING ALL BASES

ALIENS EATING HUMANS FOR FOOD IS IMMORAL

HE SAYS OF COURSE WE WOULD SAY THIS IS IMMORAL BUT THAT'S A PRETTY STRONG ASSUMPTION NOT LIKING SOMETHING AND THINKING IT IS IMMORAL ARE PRETTY DIFFERENT I SEE NO IMMORALITY ON THE ALIENS PART IN THIS SCENARIO I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN

MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT SMARTER THAN PIGS

UNLESS YOU ARE INCLUDING THOSE IN A VEGETATIVE STATE THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE

IF NO ONE EVEN THE BROTHER CARED ABOUT WHETHER HE LIVED OR DIED IT STILL WOULD BE IMMORAL TO KILL HIM FOR FOOD

AGAIN HE SAYS THIS AS A SIMPLE STATEMENT AND AGAIN I DISAGREE


WE DON'T EAT OTHER HUMANS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT OTHER HUMANS TO EAT US THAT'S THE CRUX OF OUR MORAL DECISION NOT TO EAT EACH OTHER IT'S AN AGREEMENT WE MAKE WITH THE REST OF OUR SPECIES MOST NOT ALL OTHER MEAT-EATING SPECIES WILL EAT OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN IF POSSIBLE THIS IS AN EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSE THAT FAVORS AN OWN SPECIES THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH EASIER IT IS FOR A GROUP OF ORGANISMS TO THRIVE IF THEY ALL AGREE NOT TO EAT EACH OTHER

WE HAVE NO SUCH AGREEMENT EVOLUTIONARY BIAS TO NOT EAT ORGANISMS OUTSIDE OF OUR SPECIES TO USE THE OUTER LIMITS ANALOGY SPOILER EATING HUMANS MAY NOT BE OUTSIDE THE MORALITY OF ALIENS EVEN IF WE THINK IT'S OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN MORALITY
HOW IS EATING AN ANIMAL DIFFERENT THAN EATING A PLANT A PLANT IS ALIVE IT MAY EVEN FEEL
IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE MORALLY IMPERMISSIBLE FOR ALIENS TO EAT HUMANS FOR FOOD NOT DESIRABLE FOR US CERTAINLY BUT MORALLY WRONG WOULD WE EAT THEM IF WE HAD THE CHANCE

PIGS WILL KILL AND EAT HUMANS IF GIVEN THAT CHANCE WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A SPECK OF REMORSE NEAR AS I CAN TELL DO WE OWE DIFFERENT OBLIGATIONS TO PIGS THAN THEY OWE TO US
REMOVED
AS A VEGAN I DON'T LIKE THIS ARGUMENT THERE ARE SO MANY FACETS INVOLVED WITH VEGAN VEGETARIANISM THAT SIMPLY CAN'T BE CONDENSED INTO A SIMPLE FLOW CHART

THE BEST WAY I CAN SIMPLIFY IT IS THAT THERE ARE TWO REASONS A PERSON GOES VEG A SCIENTIFIC AND B PHILOSOPHIC USUALLY THE PERSON ENDS UP ACCEPTING BOTH ARGUMENTS AS I HAVE

A HUMANS ARE NOT BIOLOGICALLY DESIGNED TO BE CARNIVORES OR ARGUABLY EVEN OMNIVORES NO OTHER SPECIES HAS TO PREPARE MEAT BEFORE CONSUMPTION NOR DO THEY REQUIRE TOOLS FOR HUNTING NO HUMAN CHASES DOWN A RABBIT AND KILLS IT WITH ITS TEETH AND EATS IT AS IS WE TRAP IT OR SHOOT IT THEN HAVE TO PREPARE IT SO IT DOESN'T MAKE US SICK CONVERSELY WE CAN PLUCK A CARROT OUT OF THE GROUND RUB THE DIRT OFF AND EAT IT RAW

THERE IS OF COURSE MORE BUT I'M ON MOBILE AND IT IS A LONG LIST THAT REQUIRES BACK ON FORTH DISCUSSION NOT A ONE SIDED LECTURE

B I ORIGINALLY SWITCHED BECAUSE OF ANIMAL CRUELTY EARTHLINGS HAS QUITE FIRMLY SCARRED ME IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS WHAT MAKES PIGS CHICKENS AND COWS LESS IMPORTANT THAN DOGS OR CATS NOTHING BUT NOBODY LIKES TO ADMIT THAT THAT'S WHY MANY CULTURES STILL EAT THEM JUST LIKE WE DO CATTLE THE REASON PEOPLE DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS IS SIMPLE CONVENIENCE MEAT WAS ONE A LUXURY FOOD BUT NOW THAT IT IS MASS PRODUCED WHY WOULDN'T YOU EAT IT THE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU HAVE SO WHY SHOULD YOU STOP IT'S INCONVENIENT TO THINK OF WHAT GOES INTO MAKING THE MEAT YOU EAT AND IT'S EASIER TO TURN A BLIND EYE AND PRETEND IT WAS ALWAYS JUST IN A BOX IT'S THE WORLD'S GREATEST EXAMPLE OF IGNORANCE IS BLISS

THEN THERE OTHER REASON LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS WHICH COULD BE CONSIDERED BOTH PHILOSOPHICAL AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC BEFORE THE FLOOD HAS A NICE LITTLE SEGMENT ON THIS

HERE'S A LECTURE BY GARY YOUROFSKY YOU SHOULD WATCH BEFORE RESPONDING

THANKS FOR READING NO HARD FEELINGS JUST DISCUSSION
THE WAY I SEE IT IS THAT IF WE'RE INDUCING PAIN OR SUFFERING TO A LIVING BEING AND OUR ACTIONS ARE NOT BORNE OUT OF NECESSITY BUT OUT OF THE NEED TO SATIATE OUR WISHES FOR SENSORY PLEASURES TASTE THEN OUR ACTIONS ARE IMMORAL

I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE GIVE A LAME ARGUMENT ABOUT PLANTS BEING ABLE TO FEEL THE PAIN OF BEING UPROOTED OR CUT THAT IS JUST NOT CORRECT PLANTS JUST MOSTLY REACT TO STIMULI AND THOSE REACTIONS ARE MOSTLY CHEMICAL IN NATURE AND NOT NEUROLOGICAL AND THEY CERTAINLY DO NOT POSSESS THE ABILITY TO COMPREHEND PAIN OR GRIEF AS EXPERIENCED BY ANIMALS SUCH AS PIGS OR CATTLE WHEN THEY'RE BEING SLAUGHTERED
MOST ANIMALS ALSO HAVE SOME SORT OF RUDIMENTARY INSTINCTIVE EMOTIONS FOR THEIR OFFSPRINGS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THEIR KIND THIS IS ANOTHER FORM OF SUFFERING WE INFLICT UPON ANIMALS THAT PLANTS ARE SPARED

COWS AND BUFFALOS ARE EVEN EVOLVED ENOUGH TO FORM DEEP FRIENDSHIPS AND ARE KNOWN TO SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION WHEN THEIR FRIEND IS SLAUGHTERED
REMOVED
BEING VEGETARIAN VEGAN IS OFTEN HEALTHIER THAN EATING MEAT AS LONG AS YOU ARE AWARE OF THE NUTRIENTS YOU NEED I THINK IT'S FAR HEALTHIER FOR THE AVERAGE HUMAN TO RUN OFF A VEGGIE ONLY DIET BUT THE AVERAGE HUMAN IS LAZY AND KNOWS LITTLE ABOUT HEALTH IN THAT CASE IT WOULD BE HEALTHIER FOR THE PUBLIC TO EAT MEAT SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE REALLY HAVE TO KNOW WHAT NUTRIENTS THEY NEED

IN MY OPINION YEARS AS A VEGETARIAN FOR ME HAS BEEN GREAT FOR MY HEALTH BUT I MONITOR MY IRON PROTEIN FAT LEVELS ETC I BELIEVE THAT EATING LIVING CREATURES SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS SHORT OF UTMOST SURVIVAL WE NOW HAVE THE MEANS TO HEALTHILY LIVE WITHOUT MEAT SO WE SHOULD


AT ONE POINT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR HUMANS TO AMPUTATE INJURED LIMBS FOR MINOR INJURIES WE USED MAGGOTS TO DEAL WITH INFECTIONS WE CONDUCTED MEDICAL OPERATIONS WITHOUT ANESTHETICS NOW THAT WE HAVE THE MEANS TO LIVE WITHOUT THOSE OPERATIONS WE DO

I FEEL LIKE EATING MEAT IS THE SAME SITUATION WE HUMANS DO BEST WHEN CONSTANTLY EVOLVING AND CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING THE WAY WE LIVE
THE BEST COUNTER ARGUMENT THAT HE DID NOT ADDRESS IS THAT PIGS ARE NOT SELF AWARE OR CONSCIOUS LIKE HUMANS ARE I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A DEBATE ABOUT THE ETHICS OF ABORTION BUT THIS IS ALSO SIMILAR TO THAT ARGUMENT THE FETUS IS NOT CONSCIOUS OR SELF AWARE SO THE RIGHTS OF WOMAN TAKE PRIORITY OVER THE RIGHTS OF THE FETUS IF SOMEONE ACCEPTS THIS VIEW ABORTION SHOULD THEY NOT ALSO APPLY IT TO KILLING ANIMALS BUT BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS DIFFERENTLY A UNIVERSAL MORAL STANDARD FOR KILLING ANIMALS WILL NEVER BE MET THE DECISION IS LEFT TO THE INDIVIDUAL
I REMEMBER VERY VIVIDLY WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND FOUND OUT THAT WE KILLED ANIMALS TO EAT IT SEEMED LIKE THE STRANGEST THING TO MY MIND I HAD ALWAYS EATEN ANIMALS AND KNEW I WAS BUT I HAD THOUGHT WE ATE THEM WHEN THEY DIED BECAUSE THAT WAS HOW I HAD UNDERSTOOD THE CIRCLE OF LIFE UP TO THAT POINT THAT WAS HOW I MADE SENSE TO IT I REALLY THOUGHT WE RAISED AND CARED FOR THEM AND MAY SOUND CREEPY BUT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE INSPECTING I THOUGHT WE WERE KIND OF HONORING THEM BY EATING THEM WE CARED FOR THEM SO THEY CARED FOR US TYPE OF THING

HONESTLY WHEN I STAND BACK AND LOOK AT IT AS IT IS NICELY LAID OUT IN THIS VIDEO ALL I CAN SURMISE IS THAT IT FALLS INTO A CATEGORY I LIKE TO CALL MODERN PRIMITIVE HUMAN SO AT ONE POINT WE MAY HAVE SURVIVED SOLELY BECAUSE OF THE KILLING OF EATING OF ANIMALS WE LEARNED FROM ANIMALS AS PEOPLE SAY ANIMALS DO IT AND IT HELPED US DURING A TIME WERE AGRICULTURAL HADN'T BEEN DEVELOPED YET OR THE REGION WAS NOT FRIENDLY TO A DIET WITHOUT ANIMALS BUT AT THIS JUNCTURE IN TIME SPACE THESE FACTORS ARE NO LONGER PROBLEMS SO PERHAPS IF WE WERE TO TRULY BE PROGRESSIVE WE WOULD BE CONSTANTLY REEVALUATING THINGS THAT WE HAVE BLINDLY FOR MOST PEOPLE INHERITED FROM A PAST THAT IS NO LONGER PRESENT


ANOTHER QUESTION TO ASK IS WHY IS IT NOT OKAY TO KILL A DOG OR CAT BUT IT'S OKAY TO KILL A PIG OR A COW ALWAYS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT
OUR MORAL CODE IS BASED ON SELF INTEREST BEFORE YOU THINK I'M GOING TO GO OFF ON AYN RAND JUST HEAR ME OUT PEOPLE OFTEN SAY WE LIVE BY A GOLDEN RULE WHEREBY WE TREAT OTHERS AS WE WISH TO BE TREATED BUT I WOULD POSIT THAT THIS IS LOOKING AT THE ISSUE TOO NARROWLY WE LIVE IN SOCIETIES THAT ARE GUIDED BY SUBJECTIVE MORAL PRINCIPLES AND WE RECOGNIZE OUR SMALL BUT IMPORTANT ROLE IN DECIDING WHAT THOSE PRINCIPALS ARE WE WANT THOSE PRINCIPALS TO PROTECT US AND BECAUSE WE ARE CAPABLE OF ENVISIONING THE FUTURE WE ALSO WANT THEM TO PROTECT WHOEVER WE MAY BECOME EAST G I'M NOT OLD NOW BUT I THINK THE ELDERLY SHOULD BE TREATED WELL BECAUSE SOME DAY I WILL BE ELDERLY TOO THIS PROTECTION DOES NOT ONLY APPLY TO OUR BODIES BUT TO THOSE WE CARE ABOUT AND OUR POSSESSION AS WELL HERE'S WHERE KILLING ANIMALS TO EAT THEM COMES IN NONE OF US CAN EVER BE A PIG AND VERY FEW WILL EVER HAVE AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION TO ONE THEREFORE AS A SOCIETY WE DON'T CARE IF PIGS ARE PROTECTED ON THE OTHER HAND IN THE CASE OF PETS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED BRAIN DAMAGE IT IS IMMORAL TO KILL AND EAT THEM BECAUSE WE EITHER ARE IN OR RECOGNIZE THE FUTURE POSSIBILITY OF THE POSITION OF CARING FOR THEM IT MAY NOT BE WRONG TO KILL SOMEONE IN A PERPETUALLY VEGETATIVE STATE BUT IT HURTS THEIR RELATIVES AS TO WHY IT SEEMS WRONG TO KILL A PIG FOR NO REASON THIS IS BECAUSE OF EMPATHY BUT IS NONETHELESS SELFISH WE SIMPLY DO NOT LIKE SUFFERING AND ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE IT WHENEVER POSSIBLE IF THAT EMPATHY IS OVERCOME BY A REWARD IN THE OTHER DIRECTION SUCH AS A JUICY RACK OF SHORT RIBS THEN IT CEASES TO BE A FACTOR ULTIMATELY THE ONLY REASON WHY PIGS ARE ON THE PLATE AND WE'RE NOT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A VOICE TO ADVOCATE FOR OURSELVES IN SOCIETIES IN WHICH PEOPLE'S VOICES ARE TAKEN AWAY THEY ARE INVARIABLY TREATED LIKE PIGS BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER TRULY A PART OF THAT SOCIETY HOWEVER THIS IS A FAILED MORAL SYSTEM FOR THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ULTIMATELY PROTECT THEM IF ONE DAY THEY TREAT SOMEONE ELSE LIKE A PIG THE NEXT DAY THEY MAY BE TREATED LIKE ONE THE TRUE GOLDEN RULE IS THIS CREATES MORAL ABSOLUTES THAT PROTECT YOU AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROTECT YOU IN THE FUTURE EVEN IF CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE NOTHING MORE
HUMANS THE ONLY PREDATORY ANIMAL TO HAVE AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS OVER EATING
I ACCEPT THE ARGUMENT THAT IT IS MORALLY WRONG TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD BUT I ALSO ACCEPT THAT I AM A BAD PERSON WHO DOESN'T OPERATE ACCORDING TO MORAL CODES BUT INSTEAD ACCORDING TO EXPEDIENCY AND CONVENIENCE EXCEPT WHEN COMPELLED BY STRONG FEELINGS TO ACT OTHERWISE I SUPPOSE I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO KILL AN ANIMAL PERSONALLY BUT BUYING IT FROM THE STORE DOESN'T BOTHER ME BECAUSE I AM REMOVED FROM THE ACTUAL MURDER OF ANIMALS IN OTHER WORDS MY DESIRE TO EAT MEAT DOES NOT OVERRIDE MY DESIRE TO BE MORALLY GOOD AND LEAD AN ETHICAL LIFE IF I AM CONVENIENTLY REMOVED FROM THE BAD FEELINGS WHICH ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY ACTIONS ERGO I AM UNETHICAL AND AS AN ADULT I HAVE MADE PEACE WITH THAT
ARE OTHER BETTER CHEAPER HEALTHIER OPTIONS

IT IS A MATTER OF CULTURE FEW CAN STEP OUT OF THERE OWN CULTURE AND RE-EXAMINE THEIR LIFE AND QUESTION EVERYTHING THEY THINK IS TRUE

WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU REALIZE THAT PAYING SOCIOPATHS TO TORTURE AND KILL ANIMALS SO YOU CAN EAT THEM IS HORRENDOUS BEHAVIOR UNNECESSARY

VEGAN IS CHEAPER HEALTHIER AND FREE OF FACTORY FARMING WHICH DESTROYS THE PLANET


AS CRUEL AS IT MAY SOUND I FIND MYSELF IN CONCURRENCE WITH KANT ANIMALS ARE A MEANS TO HUMAN SATISFACTION THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS AS THEY DO NOT CONTAIN THE CAPACITY FOR HIGHER LEVEL PLEASURES
TOO LATE TURKEY'S ALREADY DEAD

BUT THE REST OF THE YEAR IF YOU SWITCH TO A VEGETARIAN DIET YOU CAN PREVENT ABOUT METRIC TON OF FROM BE RELEASED IN TO THE ATMOSPHERE PER YEAR

IF YOU GO ALL THE WAY TO VEGAN YOU CAN PREVENT 2 METRIC TONS OF PER YEAR
LIKE THE ARM CHAIR PHILOSOPHY BOOK THE PIG THAT WANTS TO BE EATEN GREAT READ BY THE WAY
IF A PIG ASKS YOU TO EAT IT WOULD YOU
IS IT MORALLY ACCEPTABLE
I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY REASON WHY IT IS IMPERMISSIBLE FOR AN ALIEN TO KILL PEOPLE FOR FOOD I MEAN SURE AS THE FOOD WE'LL SAY WHATEVER WE WANT TO GET OUT OF BEING EATEN BUT THAT'S NOT AN ACTUAL REASON FOR THEM

MORALS MAKE SENSE ONLY FROM THE FRAME OF REFERENCE OF THE PERSON CONSIDERING THEM LOOK HOW CRAZY THE QUESTION BECOMES WHEN WE SHIFT IT DOWN THE OTHER WAY

IS IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE FOR A LION TO EAT ANIMALS FOR FOOD
I THINK AN INTERESTING QUESTION TO ENTERTAIN IS WHY IS IT MORALLY OKAY TO EAT CERTAIN ANIMALS IN SOME CULTURES AND MORALLY WRONG IN OTHERS IN WESTERN CIVILIZATION WE COULDN'T BEGIN TO FATHOM THE IDEA OF EATING A DOG AS IT IS DEEMED MAN'S BEST FRIEND BUT IN SOME IT'S A PERFECTLY NORMAL AND OFTEN CELEBRATED RITUAL INSTEAD OF ASKING WHY ANIMALS ARE OKAY TO EAT RATHER THAN HUMANS I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION OF WHY ARE SOME ANIMALS DEEMED LESS ACCEPTABLE TO EAT THAN OTHERS
IT'S NOT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL THOSE WE SOCIALIZE WITH THE ANIMALS WE KILL FOR FOOD WE DO NOT SOCIALIZE WITH FOR EXAMPLE PETS ARE ANIMALS WE SOCIALIZE WITH SO WE FIND IT IMPERMISSIBLE TO KILL PETS FOR FOOD I THINK THIS ARGUMENT SOLVES EVERY PROBLEM IN THIS VIDEO
PERSONALLY I KNOW THE REASON WE KILL AND EAT FOOD IS THAT GENETICALLY WE WE'RE BUILT TO EAT IT BUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S MORALLY WRONG IS A TOUGH QUESTION

IN MY OWN THOUGHTS I'VE IMAGINED KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD IS A LOT LIKE KILLING ALYS FOR PESTERING YOU WHY IS KILLING A PIG WRONG BUT KILLING A FLY OKAY WELL THIS CHANGED THE SUBJECT TO BE MUCH MORE BLUNT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

THE REASON I WILL SWAT A FLY AND NOT SMASH A PIGS SKULL IN OTHER THAN THE SHEAR COMMITMENT TO VIOLENCE IS THAT TO ME THE FLY DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MENTAL CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS DOING

AND I DON'T MEAN IT NEEDS TO GO TO A COLLEGE I MEAN PHYSICALLY IT DOES NOT HAVE CAPABILITY TO HAVE MORALITY MUCH LESS PHILOSOPHIES IT'S EXISTENCE

WHEN GETTING TO A CERTAIN POINT IT IS BOILED DOWN TO HOW SMART AN ANIMAL IS

MIND YOU THIS IS ALL PERSONAL OPINION

I WOULDN'T KILL A DOG BECAUSE IT'S SMART

I WOULD KILL A FLY BECAUSE IT'S DUMB

I WOULDN'T KILL A HUMAN BECAUSE IT'S SMART

I WOULD KILL A DEER BECAUSE IT'S DUMB

SO PHYSICALLY IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO SHOW SIGNS OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS TO SOME DEGREE I FEEL THAT IS WHEN MORALLY THINGS SHOULD CHANGE
ARE WE ANIMALS IF SO WE HAVE ALL RIGHTS A PRIVILEGES OF BEING AN ANIMAL

IF WE ARE MAMMALS AND WE ACT LIKE OTHER MAMMALS THEN WE DO NOT HAVE AN ETHICAL DILEMMA
I THINK IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF MORE RESEARCH WAS DONE INTO GROWING MEAT OR USING PLANT MATTER TO MAKE MEAT LIKE FOOD BUT I HAVE WATCHED DOCUMENTARY'S ON THAT TYPE OF RESEARCH AND WORK IT IS GREATLY HINDERED BY THE ALREADY EXISTING TRADITIONAL MEAT MARKET

NOT ONLY THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE A SIMILAR PRODUCT TO THE REAL THING YET THAT IS WHAT IS HOLDING THIS MOVEMENT BACK I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE THAT IT IS WRONG AND FOR ME I FIND IT WRONG NOT SO MUCH FOR THE ANIMALS WELFARE CALL ME A MONSTER BUT MORE FOR THE WELFARE OF HUMANITY THE ANIMAL AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IS WHAT IS RUINING THIS PLANET WITH GLOBAL WARMING AND IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO RAISE ANIMALS ANYMORE FOR OUR CONSUMPTION FOSSIL FUELS WOULDN'T BE AS MUCH OF A PROBLEM

THE ORIGINATOR OF THE VIDEO FAILED TO TAKE ANY THOUGHT PROCESS FROM BEGINNING TO END WITHOUT SKEWING AN EXAMPLE I'M SURE THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM THAT EXPLAINS WHAT HE IS DOING BASICALLY COMPARE APPLES TO ORANGES TO TURKEY TO IRON ORE TO LEAD THE READER VIEWER TO A SPECIFIC THOUGHT

ONE EXAMPLE THE LAST APPROACH HE TOOK WAS THE FOOD CHAIN AND HUMANS BEING AT THE TOP AND WHETHER THAT MADE IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE WHEN DELVING DEEPER HE SWITCHED THE BASIC DEFINITION OF BEING AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN BEING EQUAL TO BEING THE BIGGEST STRONGEST ENTITY THEN USED THE NEW DEFINITION AND PARALLELED IT TO A BULLY STOMPING A SMALLER AND WEAKER INDIVIDUAL

THE BULLY EXAMPLE DOES NOT EQUAL A TOP POSITION ON A FOOD CHAIN IS IT SIMILAR IN CERTAIN WAYS YES AND IN OTHER WAYS ABSOLUTELY NOT YET SINCE HE ESTABLISHED THAT IT WAS EQUAL WHEN HE DISPROVED THE BULLY MOST VIEWERS TIED THAT THOUGHT AND APPLIED IT DIRECTLY TO THE FOOD CHAIN

I'LL ONLY TOUCH ON ONE OTHER EXAMPLE SINCE THIS POST IS ALREADY MASSIVE ALIENS IS IT MORAY PERMISSIBLE FOR ALIENS TO KILL US FOR FOOD THE ORIGINATOR OF THE VIDEO YET AGAIN FAILED TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES BUT INSTEAD DREW MENTAL PARALLELS TO SIMILAR BUT DIFFERENT CONCEPTS TO LEAD THE VIEWER TO HIS DESIRED POINT

THE ALIEN EXAMPLE WOULD BE MORE CLOSER TO EQUIVALENT IF THE ORIGINATOR ASKED WHETHER OR NOT AN ALIEN WOULD FIND IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL HUMANS FOR FOOD OF COURSE A HUMAN WOULD SAY IT'S NOT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE WOULD AN ALIEN WHAT IF HUMANS REPRESENTED A LARGE PORTION OF THE ALIENS NUTRITIONAL NEEDS HAVE THE ALIENS DONE THE SAME THING TO OTHER SENTIENT RACES IN THIS CASE THE ALIEN MAY FIND IT PERFECTLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL A HUMAN FOR FOOD I STILL DO NOT BUT THAT IS IRRELEVANT

FOLKS VIDEOS LIKE THIS ARE DANGEROUS THEY ARE DANGEROUS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE A PERSON'S VIEW BY TRICKING THEM FOR A LACK OF BETTER WORDS WHEN DONE ON A LARGE SCALE SAY IF THE ORIGINATOR CREATING ADDITIONAL VIDEOS ON SIMILAR OR COLLATERAL CONCEPTS HE WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE A PERSON'S ENTIRE FRAME OF THOUGHT THIS TACTIC IS USED WIDELY IN POLITICS INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS RELIGIOUS INDOCTRINATION AND OPPRESSIVE SOCIETAL NORMS
I WOULD ARGUE THAT WHEN A SPECIES AS A WHOLE HAS THE INTELLIGENCE TO ARGUE MORAL ISSUES THEN EATING ANY ONE MEMBER OF THAT SPECIES IS WRONG SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE A MENTALLY HANDICAPPED PERSON WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE THE CAPACITY TO SEE MORAL ISSUES IT IS STILL WRONG TO EAT THAT PERSON BECAUSE THE SPECIES AS WHOLE REALIZE THE MORAL IMPLICATION OF DOING SO

SO I WOULD TELL THE ALIENS YOU CANNOT EAT US BECAUSE WE AS A SPECIES AS WHOLE CAN REASON AND ARGUE MORAL ISSUES BUT PIGS CANNOT
I DIFFER QUITE HEAVILY WHERE HE BRINGS UP HIS QUESTION IN WHICH HE STATES THE PREMISE OF ONE CARING ABOUT SOMEONE AND THAT MAKING IT WRONG TO KILL THEM HE CONCLUDES BY SAYING THAT IS FOCUSED ON THE SUBJECT AND NOT THE OBJECT THE HUMAN AND NOT THE PIG THE HYPOTHETICAL SELF AND NOT ITS BROTHER THEREFOR IT NOT SEEMING AS GOOD REASONING I THINK IT IS QUITE SELF-FOCUSED AND ALTHOUGH I AGREE IT IS ILLOGICAL I THINK IT'S ALSO SOMETHING UNCHANGEABLE

I DO CARE FOR ANY HUMAN TO SOME EXTENT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE HUMAN AND I PERSONALLY WOULD FEEL GUILTY FOR KILLING THEM I GET ALONG WITH THEM AND I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THEM BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE HUMANS UNDERSTAND ME SO I WOULD NOT KILL ANYONE UNLESS I CONSIDERED THEM TO BE BELOW CARING ABOUT I DO NOT BELIEVE I WOULD FEEL GUILT FOR MURDERING A MURDERER OR RAPIST I DO NOT FEEL GUILT FOR KILLING ANIMALS IT IS ABOUT ME AND NOT SO MUCH AT ALL THE OBJECT IN THE SITUATION AS SUCH I FEEL THAT THE MORALS BEHIND HUMANITY'S KILLING OF PIGS IS MORE ABOUT HUMANITY THAN IT IS THE PIGS AGAIN I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS LOGICAL FROM AN ABSTRACT PERSPECTIVE MORE THAN SIMPLE PROPAGATION OF ONE'S OWN SPECIES THE BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE TO CONTINUE YOUR OWN SELF ABOVE ANY AND ALL OTHERS GUILT TO FEEL UPSET AND MORALLY IN THE WRONG FOR KILLING ONE OF YOUR OWN KIND UNJUSTLY I BELIEVE IS THE HUMAN WAY OF MAKING YOU NOT WANT TO DO IT AGAIN AS TO HELP CONTINUE YOUR SPECIES THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO PIGS THUS WHY WE KILL THEM FOR THE WANT OF FOOD
I ALWAYS FIGURED THE SOLUTION TO THIS WILL BE FOUND WHEN HIGH QUALITY MASS SCALE FOOD PRODUCTION IS DONE BY 3D PRINTERS

HONESTLY I SEE THAT BEING THE FUTURE OF HOW VIRTUALLY ALL FOOD WILL BE PRODUCED EVENTUALLY TAKES THE ETHICAL QUESTION RIGHT OUT OF IT
SO HE BASICALLY COULDN'T FIND ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PIG AND A HUMAN OR AT LEAST BETWEEN A PIG AND A MENTALLY CHALLENGED HUMAN THAT DOESN'T SEEM QUITE RIGHT I MEAN I THINK IT GOES INTO THE TERRITORY OF A MORE COMPLICATED QUESTION THAT IS THE ONE OF SELF AWARENESS WE HAVE A CONSCIENCE AND AN ABILITY TO REASON AND SO DO MOST MENTALLY CHALLENGED INDIVIDUALS NOW WETHER WE CAN ACTUALLY DEFINE SELF AWARENESS WITH PRECISION I'M NOT SO SURE BUT I DO THINK THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE IT BE IT IN ANOTHER LIFE FORM SAY AN ALIEN OR EVEN IN AN AI WHY WE CONSIDER BRAIN DEAD PEOPLE AS WELL DEAD EVEN IF THEIR HEARTS ARE STILL BEATING AND WHATNOT AND WE FIND IT OK TO LET THEM DIE EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHEN WE WOULD STILL BE TRYING TO SAVE ANOTHER PERSON
IT IS NOT OK L THINK WE ARE ANIMALS AS WELL BUT WE ARE INTELLIGENT AND AS INTELLIGENT SPECIES WE SHOULD CREATE A DIFFERENT WAY TO FULFILL OUR ENERGY NEEDS AND STOP TAKING PART OF THE FOOD CHAIN WE MAY LOOK SHARP AND ALL CLEAN CUT BUT WHEN L EAT OTHER ANIMAL FLESH L FEEL DOWNGRADED TO A WILD ENVIRONMENT LIKE LION OR TIGER BECAUSE ALL ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS FEAR L GUESS THEY FEEL JUST LIKE L WOULD IF L WERE ABOUT TO BE KILL
REMOVED
I LIKE TO THINK THIS IN A MATHEMATICAL WAY IF KILLING THE ANIMAL AND EATING IT BRINGS MORE GOOD TO MY LIFE THAN IT BRINGS SUFFERING TO PIGS LIFE IT IS ACCEPTABLE IN MANY CASES I VALUE MY SMALL PLEASURE OVER ANIMAL'S DEATH BUT THIS DEPENDS ON VARIETY OF REASONS
HOW MENTALLY EVOLVED THE ANIMAL IS
2 HOW MUCH SUFFERING THE DEATH AND FARMING WOULD CAUSE
HOW MUCH GOOD I GET FROM THIS PLEASURE HEALTH EFFECTS ETC
OTHER FACTORS SAYING NO TO MY MEAT STEW WOULD MAKE HER SAD

THESE ARE JUST TO NAME A FEW AND THESE OF COURSE VARY IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS

ALL IN ALL THIS ALL COMES TO THE QUESTION HOW MUCH VALUE WE GIVE TO ANIMAL SUFFERING MY PERSONAL THOUGHT IS THAT IN MODERN SOCIETY WHERE WE DON'T EVEN SEE THE ANIMALS THIS VALUE IS WAY TOO SMALL YOU MAY THINK DIFFERENTLY
WHATS GOING TO ADVANCE SOCIETY AND THE WORLD PIG OR HUMAN
HUMANS ARE MORE INTELLECTUALLY ADVANCED THAN PIGS
IF ALIENS CAME THEY WOULD SEE US AS A INTELLECTUALLY ADVANCED SPECIES OR EQUALLY AS ADVANCED
MY OPINION
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC WHO STILL EAT HUMANS THE IDEA THAT KILLING PEOPLE TO EAT IS MORALLY WRONG IS CULTURAL NOT A UNIVERSAL ALL HIS ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON HIS ARBITRARY LINE LIFE EATS LIFE WHETHER IT BE PLANT OR ANIMAL OR BACTERIAL OR INSECT LIFE EATS LIFE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY LIFE CONTINUES I SUPPOSE YOU CAN CHOOSE THE LOCATION AT WHICH LIFE BECOMES TO COMPLEX TO MORALLY KILL TO EAT BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT UNIVERSALLY RIGHT OR WRONG THAT MAKES IT PERSONALLY RIGHT OR WRONG
THIS IS A SHITTY ARGUMENT IN THAT I WOULD EAT THE ALIEN AS EASY AS IT EATS ME IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO'S BETTER EQUIPT IF WE CAN COME TO A MUTUAL AGREEMENT THEN MAYBE WE COULD STOP FROM EATING EACH OTHER THAT MUTUAL AGREEMENT HAPPENED WITH ANOTHER DILEMMA MURDER
I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH THE SPEAKER AND CREATOR OF THE VIDEO I THINK IT IS BECAUSE OF US BEING THE SAME SPECIES THERE ARE ANIMALS OF SIMILAR LEVELS OF INTELLIGENCE THAT HUMANS DON'T MIND KILLING I THINK HUMANS NOT KILLING ONE ANOTHER FOR FOOD IS DUE TO EVOLUTION AND THE PERPETUATION OF OUR SPECIES
I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ADMIT THAT MANY PEOPLE REALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE SUFFERING OF ANIMALS AND THAT HUMAN PREFERENCE AND WILL SUPERCEDE THE RIGHTS OF ANIMALS UP UNTIL THE POINT WHEN ANIMALS CAN REASONABLY DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR VALUE

UNTIL THEN WE ARE THE ARBITERS OF VALUE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW FAR WE'VE GOTTEN COMING TO AGREE ON QUESTIONS OF VALUE JUDGMENTS
CAN'T STAND THIS FORM OF ANIMATION
WHY ARE PEOPLE NOT ASKING IT OTHER WAY AROUND WHAT'S THE POINT OF EATING ANIMALS NONE BESIDES I LIKE THERE IS NOTHING RATIONAL ABOUT BOTH ANIMAL AND DAIRY CONSUMPTION THERE IS NOTHING IN MEAT DAIRY THAT WE CAN'T GET FROM OTHER SOURCES AND THERE IS A LOT TO GAIN IF HUMANS MOVE TO VEGAN DIET IT'S WAY MORE EFFICIENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUS GLOBAL WARMING IS KINDA A BIG DEAL AND LOWERS THE RISK OF ALL CAUSE MORTALITY EVEN IF YOU LOWER IT TO EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT OF I LOVE BACON THERE ARE ALREADY VEGAN MEATS THAT TASTE IDENTICAL OR BETTER AND WITH ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY REPLICATING CERTAIN TASTES IS GETTING EASIER

ALSO ANOTHER ARGUMENT THAT PEOPLE MAKE AGAINST VEGAN DIETS IS THAT TO HAVE A BALANCED DIET THEY HAVE TO EAT SUPPLEMENTS THE THING IS THAT A LOT OF FOODS ARE FORTIFIED WITH IT FOR EXAMPLE ALMOND MILK WITH BUT PEOPLE NEVER THINK HOW THE SAME GETS INTO THEIR NORMAL DIET ANIMALS ARE FED SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE NOT EVEN THEY GET IT THROUGH THEIR DIETS IN THE END OF THE DAY THERE IS VERY LITTLE NATURAL IN OUR CURRENT DIETS THERE IS SOME SORT OF IRRATIONAL AND PURELY EMOTIONAL CONNECTION TO WHAT FOOD SUPPOSE TO BE THAT'S BASED IN CULTURAL UPBRINGING I JUST HOPE WE WILL MOVE PAST IT FOR THE SAKE OF ENVIRONMENT AND OUR OWN HEALTH
IT'S NOT ETHICS IT'S BEEN SURVIVAL AND THEN A COMMODITY BECAUSE WE HARNESSED THE ABILITY TO DO SO ANIMALS HAVE ALWAYS EATEN OTHER LIVING THINGS PLANTS TOO ARE LIVING THINGS
IT IS UNFAIR BUT LIFE IS UNFAIR
WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT FARMED ANIMALS SUCH AS PIGS ONLY EXIST BECAUSE CHRY ARE KILLED FOR FOOD HUMAN HAVE KEPT THEM ALIVE FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING FOOD AND BRED THEM WE HAVE MODIFIED THEIR DNA TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY NOT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE IN THE WILD IF THEY COULD THEY WOULD CERTAINLY CHANGE WHATEVER ENVIRONMENT THEY WERE PUT IN DRAMATICALLY IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY WERE RELEASED INTO THE WILD IN THE FORM AND NUMBERS THAT THEY NOW HAVE IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO ANY ECOSYSTEM
I STOPPED EATING MEAT BUT MY MORAL REASON FOR DOING IT HAS LESS TO DO WITH KILLING AND MORE TO DO WITH HOW MUCH FARM ANIMALS SUFFER WHILE ALIVE I THINK IT IS MORE MORALLY CORRECT TO HUNT OR FISH THAN TO RUN A FACTORY FARM WHY I GUESS WHAT I AM SAYING IS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO BE SHOT DEAD BY A STRAY BULLET THAN TO LIVE A LIFETIME ENSLAVED
SO I'M A VEGAN BUT I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE FINE TO KILL HUMANS FOR FOOD IT ISN'T BUT IT SHOULD BE WE WOULD NEED TO REDUCE THE HUMANS TO PLANT LEVEL FIRST THOUGH I'D FIND IT SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY KILLING PLANTS FOR FOOD OTHERWISE

AS SUCH IF YOU INSIST ON EATING ANIMALS I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST BITE THE BULLET AND ACCEPT THAT THERE'S NO GOOD REASON THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE MORALLY OK TO EAT HUMANS PROVIDED THE HUMANS IN QUESTION ARE AT ANIMAL LEVEL WHAT EXACTLY ANIMAL LEVEL ENTAILS IS A SEPARATE QUESTION

I REACHED THIS CONCLUSION LARGELY AFTER REACHING MY REASONS FOR WHY KILLING PEOPLE IS WRONG I THINK THE REASONS IT'S WRONG TO KILL A HUMAN GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE

AS A HUMAN IF WE LIVED WITHOUT ORDER ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING THREATS TO MY SAFETY WOULD BE OTHER HUMANS OTHER HUMANS FEEL THE SAME WAY AS SUCH THERE IS UTILITY IN BANDING TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT KILL EACH OTHER I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WASTE TIME WORRYING ABOUT BEING KILLED

2 THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER HUMANS I CARE ABOUT I WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE THEM KILLED EVEN IF I DON'T HAVE ANY REAL EMOTIONAL CONNECTION TO THEM THEY MIGHT STILL PRODUCE SOMETHING USEFUL I'D HATE TO SEE THAT NOT OCCUR

THE AUTHOR OF THE VIDEO MENTIONED THESE TWO POINTS INDIVIDUALLY CARING ISN'T THE REASON WE DON'T KILL OTHER PEOPLE NEITHER IS POWER BUT WHEN YOU COMBINE THE TWO YOU'RE STUCK WITH A BALANCING ACT IF YOUR ALLIANCE IS TOO SMALL YOU STILL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OTHER ALLIANCES KILLING YOU SO YOU CAN GAIN UTILITY BY GROWING YOUR ALLIANCE IF YOUR ALLIANCE IS TOO LARGE THERE'S NOBODY LEFT TO KILL BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY IN YOUR ALLIANCE WHO WANTS TO PROTECT THE VICTIM THEREFORE IF YOU START KILLING PEOPLE YOU RISK FRACTURING THE ALLIANCE AND REDUCING UTILITY

THAT IS IT'S WRONG TO KILL THE HERMIT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME JERK IN OUR ALLIANCE WHO HAS THIS PESKY THING CALLED EMPATHY TOWARDS OTHER HUMANS AND WE DON'T WANT TO FRACTURE OUR ALLIANCE BY ALIENATING THAT JERK IN THE STRONG WEAK DOODLE WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S PLAYING WHICH ROLE THAT ONE COULD BE WRONG BECAUSE OF THE EMPATHY JERK OR IT COULD BE WRONG BECAUSE THE WEAK PERSON IS IN OUR ALLIANCE OR A FEW OTHER THINGS

SO THAT'S WHY IT'S WRONG TO KILL HUMANS TO EAT THEM WHEN WE DON'T NEED TO THERE MIGHT BE OTHER REASONS TO KILL HUMANS BUT JUST TO EAT THEM IS NOT ONE

NOW CONSIDER THE FETUS IF WE TAKE THE THOMPSON ROUTE AND CONSIDER IT A HUMAN IS IT MORALLY OK TO KILL A FETUS TO EAT IT SAY IT WAS GROWN IN A VAT SO WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE MOTHER LET'S MAKE THIS FETUS A HERMIT IT HAS NO REAL CONNECTIONS TO ANYBODY ELSE THIS IS WHY I SAY IT SHOULD BE OK TO EAT HUMANS I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY GOOD REASON TO CARE ABOUT THIS FETUS AND THERE IS NO RISK OF AN ARMY OF FETUSES RISING UP AND OVERTHROWING OUR ALLIANCE SURE IT MIGHT EVENTUALLY GROW UP TO CREATE SOMETHING USEFUL BUT SO MIGHT MILLIONS OF SPERM YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT SPERM DO YOU THERE WERE SOME RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE WASTED IF WE SIMPLY KILLED IT BUT WE'RE EATING IT WE SPEND RESOURCES TO EAT THINGS ALL THE TIME SO WHY IS IT WRONG TO KILL THIS FETUS AND EAT IT BECAUSE SOME JERKS THIS TIME I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS WOULD GET PRETTY PISSED OFF AT US IF WE STARTED DOING THAT TO THE POINT WHERE OUR ALLIANCE MIGHT FRACTURE THE FRACTURED ALLIANCE IS NOT WORTH THAT FETUS MEAT IT MIGHT BE WORTH STEM CELLS BUT FOOD IS EASY TO FIND

AS A VEGAN I'M THE JERK WHO CARES ABOUT ANIMALS ENOUGH TO NOT KILL THEM THERE'S REASONS THAT I CARE ABOUT THEM BUT THOSE REASONS ARE UNRELATED TO THE QUESTION OF KILLING THEM WHAT MATTERS IS THAT I CARE UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE ANIMALS I DON'T CARE NEARLY ENOUGH ABOUT THEM TO ALLY MYSELF WITH THEM AGAINST YOU AND EVEN IF I DID ONCE I TURNED AGAINST YOU THE WEB OF CARING WOULDN'T PROTECT ME THE WEB ONLY WANTS ME TO NOT BE RANDOMLY MURDERED THE WEB IS A LOT MORE UNDERSTANDING WHEN THE MOTIVE IS DEFENSE THAT'S WHAT THE ALLIANCE IS FOR AFTER ALL

AS SUCH I'M STUCK PUSHING FOR PEOPLE TO CARE ABOUT ANIMALS POSSIBLY TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'D TURN AGAINST THOSE WHO DON'T UNTIL THERE'S ENOUGH OF US TO MAKE YOU STOP AT WHICH POINT IT WOULD BECOME WRONG FOR YOU TO KILL ANIMALS EVEN IF YOU COULDN'T SEE A GOOD REASON FOR IT

IN OTHER WORDS EVEN AS A VEGAN I WASN'T PARTICULARLY CONVINCED BY THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS VIDEO AS SUCH I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF OTHERS AREN'T

THAT'S THE MUSINGS OF SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT UTILITARIANISM AND RELATIVISM AREN'T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS
THIS IS A COMPLICATED DISCUSSION AND I'VE CONSIDERED MYSELF A HYPOCRITE MY WHOLE LIFE FOR EATING ANIMALS AND STILL DO I THINK THE MORAL REASON MUST BE TIED TO OUR STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE VALUE IN EVERYDAY LIFE THROUGH THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS AND COMPREHENSION OF WHAT IT IS TO EXIST AND TO DIE MAINLY THE LAST ONE BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO INTENDED TO DO NOTHING MEANINGFUL WITH THEIR LIFE WOULD STILL NOT BE OK TO KILL

MOST SOCIAL REASONS FOR NOT EATING PEOPLE ARE PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS NOT MORAL ARGUMENTS BESIDES WHICH WHAT IS IT THEN THAT STRIKES US ABOUT DOLPHINS AND ELEPHANTS THAT MAKES IT LESS OK TO KILL THEM I'D SAY THE COMPREHENSION OF EXISTENCE AND DEATH WHICH INTELLIGENCE CONTRIBUTES TO IS THE MAIN FACTOR WE THINK A LOT LESS ABOUT KILLING INSECTS WHICH HAVE AS FAR AS I KNOW NO CONCEPT OF LIFE AND OPERATE ON REFLEXES I CAN'T HOWEVER JUSTIFY NOT KILLING UNATTACHED PEOPLE SO COGNITIVELY VACANT THAT THEY MAY HAVE THE SAME UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE AND DEATH AS A PIG I THINK WE DON'T DO THIS ONLY BECAUSE OF HUMAN CONNECTIONS AND THE PARALLELS BETWEEN THAT SPECIMEN AND OURSELVES

IN A FUTURE WHERE WE CAN SYNTHESISE ALL FOOD REASONABLY AND A PERSON CAN WITH SOME EFFORT ADOPT A VEGETARIAN LIFESTYLE TODAY KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD IS IMMORAL IGNORING CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THE SYNTHESIS BEING DETRIMENTAL TO THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH MAY OUTWEIGH THIS WE'LL PROBABLY DO IT ANYWAY AS WE DO TODAY
PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD KILL ANIMALS BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HUMANS SHOULD BE HELD ABOVE OTHER ANIMALS

HOWEVER IF IT WERE MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL ANIMALS I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE BECAUSE DOMESTIC ANIMALS SUCH AS PIGS HORSES AND DOGS WERE BRED BY HUMANS FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE WHETHER THAT BE TO PROVIDE MEAT PULL LOADS OR BE COMPANIONS WE CREATED THEM FOR A PURPOSE AND BREED THEM FOR SUCH PURPOSE

WHETHER OR NOT ANIMAL BREEDING IS ETHICAL IS ARGUABLE THOUGH
HE COMPLETELY GLOSSES OVER SENTIENCE MIRROR TEST ETC DOESN'T HE
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT OFTEN SEEMS TO BE GLOSSED OVER BY THE TYPES OF ARGUMENTS IN THIS VIDEO AND THAT IS THAT ANIMALS DO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD COMPLEX EMOTIONAL LIVES I OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE WHO WORK AROUND FARM ANIMALS COMMENT ON HOW STUPID THE ANIMALS ARE OR THAT THEY DON'T SHOW EMOTIONS WHICH THEY CITE AS JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY IT'S OKAY TO KILL THEM AND I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF GOLDEN RETRIEVERS OR EVEN PEOPLE FOR THAT MATTER WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT IF BORN AND RAISED IN THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT IN FACT MOST RESEARCH ON NEGLECTED CHILDREN POINTS TO EXACTLY THAT OUTCOME STUNTED INTELLECT AND FLAT AFFECTION I'M ALWAYS SHOCKED WHEN I SEE NEW RESEARCH SHOWING THAT ANIMALS MIGHT HAVE EMOTIONS WELL NO SHIT EVER MET A CAT OR DOG
ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE FOOD CHAIN EXISTS SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT'S OKAY
IN OUR CURRENT CAPITALIST SOCIETIES MAINSTREAM ETHICS INDICATES MEAT EATING IS NORMATIVE AND HEALTHY OBVIOUSLY THIS COINCIDES CONVERGES WITH WHAT IS IN THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF GREAT SWATHES OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY AS MUCH AS SMOKING WAS SIMILARLY CONSIDERED NORMATIVE AND EVEN HEALTHY BY MAINSTREAM CULTURE AND ETHICS JUST A FEW DECADES AGO MEAT EATING CONTINUES TO BE SO DIAMETRICALLY AND IRONICALLY THE HORRENDOUS SUFFERING OF ANIMALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEAT INDUSTRY IS ABSENT IN THE PRODUCTION PART OF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY BUT VERY MUCH ASSOCIATED WITH ONE MIGHT EVEN SAY TRANSFERRED TO THE CONSUMPTION PART OF THE INDUSTRY CAPITALISM SEEKS TO EXPLOIT THE NATURAL WORLD INCLUDING OF COURSE THE HUMAN ELEMENT OF SUCH A WORLD AS INTENSIVELY AND PROFITABLY AS POSSIBLE THE HUMAN CONSUMERS OF VENDED MEAT ARE AS MUCH A PART OF THE AXIS OF EXPLOITATION AS ARE THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ANIMALS UTILIZED AND PROCESSED BY SAID INDUSTRY EVERY YEAR IT IS JUST THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE PSYCHOLOGICALLY UNPREPARED TO VIEW THEIR OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH SAID INDUSTRY IN SUCH A WAY BECAUSE THEY SUPPOSEDLY HAVE FREE WILL AND ARE MASTERS OF THEIR OWN DECISION MAKING AS CONSUMERS AND ULTIMATELY AS SENTIENT BEINGS TOUT COURT HOWEVER FREE WILL IS MORE AND MORE BECOMING A PRINCIPAL TOPIC OF PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY AND SERIOUS ARGUMENTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING POSITED IN THE ACADEMY SUGGESTIVE OF THE PROBABILITY THAT FREE WILL IS IN GREAT PART AN A POSSIBLY NECESSARY ONE IF FREE WILL IS DEPENDENT ON A LEVEL OF COGNITION AND AWARENESS NOT TO SPEAK OF OMNISCIENCE THAT MOST PEOPLE ROUTINELY FAIL TO SHOW THEN THE ARGUMENT THAT FREE WILL IS LESS PRESENT AND LESS OF A FACTOR IN PEOPLES LIVES THAN THEY WOULD LIKELY CARE TO ACKNOWLEDGE CONSIDERING WESTERN VENERATION OF THE SAME IS CERTAINLY NOT AT ALL UNCONVINCING SO IF IT IS TRUE THAT PEOPLE CONSISTENTLY EMPLOY MUCH LESS FREE WILL THAN NORMALLY IMAGINED THEN THE DECISIONALITY REQUISITE TO ACHIEVE IT IN AN ISSUE AS INGRAINED AS A NATION'S OR A REGION'S CULTURAL DIET LIES NOT WITH THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES BUT WITH THE INSTITUTIONS DESIGNATED FOR THE SPECIALIZATION OF CHANGE AND OR STASIS I EAST NAMELY GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY THE SEISMIC SHIFT IN WESTERN AND ESPECIALLY AMERICAN SOCIETY'S CONSUMPTION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS SUGGESTS IMPORTANT CHANGE IS POSSIBLE AND RELATIVELY QUICKLY HOWEVER THAT CHANGE WILL BE DEPENDENT NOT ON THE PHILOSOPHICAL EPISTEMOLOGY OF INDIVIDUALS BUT ON THE ACTIVATION OF THE DECISIONALITY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED SPECIALIZING ENGINES OF SOCIETAL CHANGE IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS NAMELY GOVERNMENT AND ITS CONTROLLERS IN THAT NATIONAL CAPITALIST SENATE CONSTITUTED BY THE MAJOR CAPITALIST INDUSTRIES
THIS VIDEO IS SO CLOSE TO THE TOPIC I WROTE ABOUT A WHILE AGO AS PART OF A RIGGED COMPETITION I WROTE THIS ESSAY AS PART OF A COMPETITION LIMITED WORD COUNT AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS ANY REBUTTAL TO MY POSITION

THOUGHTS



THIS CONTEST IS TO MAKE A CASE THAT IT IS ETHICAL TO EAT MEAT MORE CORRECTLY FRAMED IS IT ETHICALLY PERMISSIBLE TO EAT MEAT YES

THERE IS NOTHING BEYOND THIS LATTER FORMULATION OF THIS CONTEST S CHARGE THE FORMULATION OF EXPLAIN WHY IT IS ETHICAL TO EAT MEAT IS ACTUALLY A REQUEST TO DEMONSTRATE WHY IT IS MERELY ETHICALLY PERMISSIBLE TO EAT MEAT AS OPPOSED TO WHY IT IS GOOD TO DO ACTION I

IF THIS CONTEST CHARGED US OMNIVORES TO EXPLAIN THAT IT IS GOOD TO EAT MEAT THE CHARGE WOULD HAVE LOOKED DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT

THE ADVOCATE OF AN HERBIVOROUS SOCIETY WOULD HAVE TO PASS A HIGH STANDARD NOT ONLY THAT EATING MEAT IS NOT GOOD BUT ALSO THAT EATING MEAT IS ETHICALLY IMPERMISSIBLE

A PROOF THAT IT IS ETHICALLY PERMISSIBLE TO EAT MEAT COULD TAKE ONE OF A NUMBER OF FORMS THE TERSEST IS A REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM ARGUENDO THEN I ASSUME THAT THE ONLY ETHICALLY PERMISSIBLE DIETARY CHOICE FOR US IS AN HERBIVOROUS ONE

THERE IS NO PRINCIPLE TO THE NORMATIVE ASSERTION THAT WE MUST NOT EAT MEAT THAT IS ALL ADVOCATES AGAINST EATING MEAT NECESSARILY CHOOSE ONE LEVEL OF HARMING ANIMALS AND THEN ADMONISH THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEIR ARBITRARY CHOICE ALL ACTS OF HUMANS INEXORABLY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

EVEN IF OUR ENTIRE SPECIES WAS FORCED TO BE HERBIVOROUS IGNORING THE UTTERLY IMMORAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A NIGHTMARE THE HARVESTING OF CROPS WOULD EITHER USE ANIMALS OR WOULD USE MACHINES THAT POLLUTE AND KILL THE NATURAL INHABITANTS OF THE CROPS SQUIRRELS MICE SPIDERS ET CETERA TO HARVEST THE PLANTS

IF ON PRINCIPLE IT IS IMPERMISSIBLE TO HARM ANIMALS THEN NO DIETARY CHOICE IS ETHICALLY PERMISSIBLE HUMANS MUST EAT AND IT IS METAETHICALLY INVALID TO HAVE AN ETHICAL PRINCIPLE THAT INJURES HUMANITY THEREFORE WE HAVE FOUND OUR ABSURDITY AND THE REDUCTIO IS COMPLETE THUS THE ORIGINAL ASSUMPTION IS FALSE AND ITS CONTRARY MUST NECESSARILY BE TRUE AN HERBIVOROUS DIETARY CHOICE IS NOT THE ONLY MORALLY PERMISSIBLE CHOICE ID EST IT IS AT LEAST ETHICALLY PERMISSIBLE TO EAT MEAT WHAT ALTERNATIVE IS THERE

I MUST NOW SPEAK TO A FRAMING ISSUE TO FRAME THIS ISSUE AS BETWEEN CARNIVORES AND HERBIVORES IS TO MISS A CRUCIAL EVOLUTIONARY POINT WE ARE ALL OMNIVORES JUST AS WE ARE ALL DIURNAL WE MAY CHOOSE TO WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT EVEN IF WE CHOOSE TO DO SO HOWEVER IT DOES NOT CHANGE OUR DIURNAL NATURE

THIS DISCUSSION ARISES FROM THE PROBLEM OF A COMFORTABLE SOCIETY EDWARD ROYAL MURROW APTLY DESCRIBED OUR SOCIETY AS WEALTHY FAT COMFORTABLE AND COMPLACENT I THINK THIS DESCRIPTOR SHINES LIGHT ON THE PRESENT ARTIFICIAL CONTROVERSY THAT IS THE ARTIFICIAL POSITION AGAINST MEAT IS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY OF AN OPULENT SOCIETY TAKE AWAY OUR OPULENCE AND WATCH VEGANS EAT PORK DOG HORSE ANYTHING TO SURVIVE

THE LAST ISSUE NECESSARY TO PROVE THAT IT IS ETHICALLY PERMISSIBLE TO EAT MEAT IS DEFINING HUMANE HUMANE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS EXPLICATES HOW THE PERSON TREATS THE ANIMAL AND WHY WHEREAS INFLICTING PAIN AND DEATH UPON AN ANIMAL FOR PURPOSES OF FULFILLING A DIETARY NEED IS ETHICAL DOING SO FOR THE ENDS OF ENTERTAINMENT IS NOT

WE OMNIVORES CAN FEEL FAMILIAL WITH OUR CATS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME FATTENING UP A GOOSE FOR FOIE GRAS ACTING HUMANE IS A PRODUCT OF ONE S ENDS

IT IS ETHICAL TO EAT MEAT BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DEMONSTRATE AN ETHICAL PRINCIPLE AGAINST CLEAN EFFICIENT AND HUMANE ABATTOIRS IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO ASSERT A FEELING ONE MUST ASSERT AND HOLD A PRINCIPLE IN THIS DEBATE ONLY OMNIVORES CAN DO THAT

IT WOULD CAUSE SO MUCH SOCIAL DISHEVEL THAT A SOCIAL ANIMAL LIKE US WOULDN'T GET ANYWHERE WE MAKE RULES AND ENDOW OTHERS TO CAPTURE PEOPLE WHO CAUSE SOCIAL DISHEVEL NO TRUST NO COOPERATION THEN YOU HAVE NO ROOM FOR PROGRESS

WHY WOULD A SPECIES CAPABLE OF MAKING TECH THAT CAN JUMP FROM SOLAR SYSTEM TO SOLAR SYSTEM NOT JUST PROGRAM AND GROW A FARM ANIMAL TASTIER THAN US AND WANTS TO BE EATEN IT IS A SUBMISSIVE VOREAPHILE INTELLIGENT LIFE REALLY THINKS HEY ONCE I HAVE THE ABILITY OF GODS THROUGH MY TECH ITS TIME TO JUST IGNORE MY POTENTIAL AND JUST BECOME AN INTERPLANETARY TERRORIST IT WOULDN'T DAWN ON THEM THAT THIS IS A BIG WASTE OF TIME AND THEY COULD GO ZIP OVER TO A COOLER PLACE AND WATCH STARS EXPLODE OR SOMETHING WHY ARE IN ESSENCE A MORTAL AND PITIFUL THING BEING COMPARE TO A GOD RACE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL BETWEEN THE TWO SHOULD BE SO GREAT THAT ITS MEANINGLESS TO USE THE SAME SCALES TO JUDGE
MORALITY ARGUMENTS ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE USELESS IMO UNLESS THERE IS A PREDEFINED SYSTEM OF DETERMINING MORALITY THAT BOTH ARGUING PARTIES ACCEPTANCE PERHAPS SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF THAT WHICH PROVIDES A NET BENEFIT TO SAPIENT SPECIES WITHOUT INFRINGING ON NATURAL RIGHTS OF SAPIENT SPECIES MEMBERS IS MORAL IF THERE IS NO CONSENSUS IT BOILS DOWN TO AN ARGUMENT OVER WHOSE EQUALLY SUBJECTIVE METHOD OF DETERMINING MORALITY IS BETTER ONE CAN EASILY SEE THE DIFFICULTY IN HAVING A GOOD DEBATE IN THIS CASE

THE GUY IN THE VIDEO HASN'T REALLY DEFINED HIS IDEA OF MORALITY DOWN TO A CORE TENET OR TENETS HOW CAN ONE EVALUATE HIS POSITION FROM A LOGICAL STANDPOINT IF HE PROVIDES NO STARTING POINT FOR DEFINING HIS SYSTEM OF DETERMINING MORALITY ALL WE ARE LEFT WITH ARE HIS IDEAS WHICH COULD BE NO MORE THAN GUT FEELINGS OF HIS IF HIS SYSTEM BOILS DOWN TO MORALITY IS THAT WHICH IS AGREEABLE TO ME IN MY HEART OF HEARTS THIS BECOMES NOT AN EXERCISE IN PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT BUT RATHER A LECTURE ON SOMEONE SUBJECTIVE SENSE OF MORALITY

HE OFFERS NO BACKING FOR WHY IT IS MORALLY IMPERMISSIBLE TO EAT HUMANS HE JUST SAYS NUMBER WHY WOULD IT BE MORALLY IMPERMISSIBLE FOR HUMANS TO BE FARMED BY ALIENS WHILE THE ACTION WOULD DEFINITELY SEEM DISAGREEABLE TO ME AS A HUMAN I DON'T SEE WHAT MAKES IT MORALLY IMPERMISSIBLE AND HE OFFERS NO SOLUTION TO MY QUANDARY
THE REAL ANSWER IS THE MORALITY IS A MADE UP THING THAT DOESNT PERTAIN TO NATURE

THE WHOLE IDEA THAT THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT OR WRONG AND THAT WE MUST TAKE ACTION THAT IS RIGHT IS SUCH BULLSHIT THE WORLD WOULDNT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN OURSELVES IF WE FOLLOWED ANY OF THIS LOGIC

IF ITS NOT OK TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD THEN YOU ALSO ARE DENYING HUNTING ALONG WITH FARMING THE WORLD MIGHT SURVIVE WITHOUT ANIMAL FARMS BUT YOU COULD END UP BEING DROWNED IN WILDLIFE IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU REMOVE HUMANS AS PREDATORS FROM AREAS WHERE NATURAL PREDATORS HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN REMOVED OR HUNTED TO NEAR NOTHINGNESS

SURE YOU MAY BE SAYING HEY THERE ARE PLENTY OF SOLUTIONS LIKE REINTRODUCING PREDATORS OR WHATEVER BUT THEN THE MORAL QUESTIONS BECOME IS IT OK FOR HUMANS TO TAKE ACTION KNOWING THAT IT WILL LEAD TO THE DEATH OF ANIMALS

THEN YOU GET INTO OTHER MORALLY STICKY QUESTIONS ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING AREAS WHERE SOME ANIMALS MAY DIE OFF DUE TO HUMAN DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER INTERACTIONS IS IT OK TO ALLOW THOSE ANIMALS TO DIE FROM LACK OF HUMAN HELP WHAT ABOUT ZOOS OR PREDATORS THAT WOULDN'T SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN IN THE WILD CAN WE KILL OTHER ANIMALS TO SAVE THOSE ANIMALS

YOU CAN SEE THE DILEMMAS AND IM SURE EVERYONE HAS AN ANSWER ABOUT AT WHAT POINT KILLING IS ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE EVERYONE WHO ASKS THESE QUESTION SEEMS OK WITH SAYING NO TO KILLING ANIMALS UNTIL THEY THREATEN HUMAN HABITATION BUT THATS NOT HOW MORALITY WORKS YOUR SUPPOSED TO DO THE BEST THING FOR EVERYONE THAT FALLS UNDER YOUR MORAL CODE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DONT KILL EVERYONE AND TORCH EVERYTHING INVOLVED IN YOUR HOUSE FORECLOSURE EVEN IF ITS YOUR ONLY OPTION TO KEEP YOU FROM BEING HOMELESS

THE RULES OF NATURE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT MATTER THE WEAK DIE AND THE STRONG SURVIVE MORALITY IS A HUMAN INVENTION THAT APPLIES TO HUMANS CREATED BECAUSE IT HELPS TO STRENGTHEN OUR SOCIETY WE EAT PIGS AND COWS BECAUSE THEY ARE TASTY AND EASY TO FARM WE DONT FARM BEARS BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD TO FARM AND LESS TASTY BUT IF EITHER ONE IS CHARGING AT YOU WITH INTENT TO KILL YOUR GONNA BLAST IT RIGHT IN THE FACE BECAUSE YOUR STRONG AND THEY ARE WEAK AND ANY MORALITY ARGUMENTS ARE GONNA GO RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW
BASED ON OBSERVATION WE MOSTLY EAT ANIMALS WITH EYES ON THE SIDE OF THEIR FACE WHEREAS WE HAVE EYES IN THE FRONT PREDATOR VERSUS PREY DESIGN LIONS DON'T EAT OTHER LIONS OR HYENAS FOR THAT EAT PREY ANIMALS JUST BECAUSE WE ARE CAPABLE OF FARMING OUR PREY VERSUS CATCHING IT DOESN'T CHANGE IT'S ACCEPTABILITY I HUNT FOR BIG GAME AND WILL CONTINUE TO THIS IS HOW I PUT GOOD THE TABLE THIS IS VERY SIMPLE TO ME PREY ANIMALS KNOW THEY ARE PREY AND WE KNOW WE ARE PREDATORS
MY ARGUMENT WOULD BE THAT HUMANS DIE AT THE HANDS OF OTHER LIVING THINGS LIKE BACTERIA AND OUR OWN CELLS CANCER WHICH HAVE NO CONCEPT OF MORALS SO THERE IS NO ARGUMENT AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORAL TO KILL US FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THEM AS A SPECIES ANIMALS EAT EACH OTHER SIMILARLY ALTRUISTICALLY SPEAKING HUMANS DON'T KILL EACH OTHER FOR FOOD BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BE FOR THE BETTERMENT OF US AS A SPECIES MOST OTHER CREATURES DON'T KILL THEIR OWN KIND FOR FOOD BECAUSE THAT WOULD NOT BE EVOLUTIONARILY ADVANTAGEOUS OUR DNA IS DIFFERENT FROM ANIMALS THAT WE EAT AND IT IS ALSO DIFFERENT FROM PLANTS AND WE THINK IT IS MORALLY RIGHT TO KILL PLANTS FOR FOOD MORALS ARE SUBJECTIVE IF YOU LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE IT IS THOUGHT THAT ANIMALS AND NOT PLANTS SHOULD ALL THRIVE EVOLUTIONARILY BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THOSE DIFFERENCES IN DNA THEN IT WOULDN'T REALLY BE MORALLY RIGHT TO KILL THEM FOR FOOD THERE ARE CULTURES THAT ARE VEGETARIAN IF YOUR CULTURE ONLY STRIVES TOWARDS THE BETTERMENT OF JUST MANKIND THEN IT IS MORAL TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD
IN THE BEGINNING HE SAID THAT THE VIDEO WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IF IT WAS MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO EAT ANIMALS FOR FOOD BUT ISN'T KILLING AN ANIMAL FOR FOOD IMPLYING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO EAT THE ANIMAL I'M A BIT CONFUSED WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT SOFTWARE THEY USE TO MAKE THOSE VIDEOS
I BELIEVE THIS IS AN INTERESTING TOPIC AND I ALSO DON'T THINK THE CREATOR OF THE VIDEO USED THE SOUNDEST OR MOST HONEST REASONING HOWEVER ONE THING I HAVE YET TO SEE MENTIONED IS THAT HUMANS UNLIKE ALL OTHER SPECIES HAVE OTHER OPTIONS FOR SUSTENANCE OTHER ANIMALS KILL AND CONSUME OUT OF NECESSITY WE HAVE EVOLVED TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY EXAMINE THIS QUESTION AND CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE MAKING THE CORRECT CHOICES WITH HOW WE FEED OURSELVES

I BELIEVE WE ARE NOT FAR AWAY FROM A TIME WHEN THE MAJORITY OF OUR ANIMAL PRODUCTS ARE ARTIFICIALLY CREATED THIS ABSOLVES US OF ANY POTENTIAL MORAL OR ETHICAL BURDEN WITH THIS DILEMMA AND WILL LIKELY BE A MORE AFFORDABLE AND LESS ECOLOGICALLY IMPACTFUL METHOD FOR FUELLING HUMANITY

AS INTERESTING OF A THOUGHT EXERCISE AS THIS IS I STILL LOVE BACON
I THINK THESE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ASKED ALL GO TOGETHER EACH ANSWER SEPARATELY DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY YOU SHOULD SHOULDN'T EAT PIGS BUT TOGETHER HOLISTICALLY THEY BETTER CHIP AWAY AT IT ALSO IS KILLING MORALLY IMPERMISSIBLE OR IS IT THE SUFFERING WHAT IF THERE WASN'T SUFFERING I THINK THAT'S A BETTER DIRECTION
SECONDLY I THINK YOU COULD HAVE TOUCHED ON THE DIFFERENT SPECIES ARGUMENT BETTER THERE ARE MORE THAN JUST GENETICS THAT STOP PERMISSIBILITY
LASTLY YOUR LOW INTELLIGENCE ARGUMENT I THINK THE REASON THERE COULD BE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR DISABLED BROTHER AND A PIG IS THAT YOUR BROTHER HAS CAPACITY YOUR BROTHER IS A PERSON AND PERSON COMES WITH THE CAPACITY FOR MORE THAN A PIG THAT MEANS SOMETHING
SORRY IF THIS IS BADLY WORDED I'M A MUCH BETTER TALKER THAT I AM COMMENTER
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS ARGUED VERY HONESTLY AT ALL BUT I THINK THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I COULD PUT OUT THERE THAT HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ADDRESSED HERE FIRST CANNIBALISTIC CULTURES DO EXIST OR DID IN NOT REALLY SURE ON THEIR CURRENT STATUS NOT ALL CANNIBALISTIC SOCIETIES PRACTICED THEIR CANNIBALISM IN THE SAME WAY BUT THERE WERE A FEW THAT WOULD HUNT PRAY FOR PART OF THEIR DIET SIMILAR TO THE WAY A SOMEONE IN OUR CULTURE MIGHT HUNT AN OTHER ANIMAL IT MIGHT NOT BE A PRACTICE THAT IS DESIRABLE TO US IN OUR CULTURE BUT IT IS CLEARLY OR WAS AT ONE TIME MORALLY ACCEPTABLE TO KILL ANOTHER HUMAN FOR FOOD IN THOSE VERY FEW SOCIETIES SECOND A MUCH BETTER ARGUMENT IS THAT IT IS UNSANITARY AND ULTIMATELY DETRIMENTAL TO ONES HEALTH TO EAT AN OTHER HUMAN BEING EVEN AFTER BEING COOKED THIS DOES NOT MAKE IT IMMORAL TO DO SO HOWEVER I FAIL TO SEE HOW KILLING AN ANIMAL THAT IS POISONOUS TO EAT FOR FOOD IS EQUALLY MORAL TO KILLING AN ANIMAL THAT IS HEALTHY AND NOURISHING TO EAT FOR FOOD IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE THE PIG A MORAL CHOICE SIMPLY THE MORE MORAL CHOICE

THIRD AND KIND OF IRRELEVANT SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO ME HOW NOTHING A CHILD CAN DO CAN BE CONSIDERED IMMORAL WE HAVE CUVY FOR A REASON AND IT'S NOT TO CATCH THE SUNSHINE AND DAISIES COMING OUT THEIR ASSES WHATEVER YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IF A KID WERE TO PUNCH ME I'D TOTALLY PUNCH THEM BACK NO I WOULDN'T DO IT VERY HARD BUT I'M NOT GOING TO LIE DOWN FOR SOME LITTLE BRAT
PHILOSOPHY HAS NO STRONG ANSWERS TO ETHICAL QUESTIONS ANSWERS WHICH COMMAND UNDER REASON WITH A CAPITAL R SUCH THAT ANY REASONABLE PERSON OF GOODWILL MUST COMPLY PHILOSOPHY OFFERS A SWAMP OF AND HOPELESSLY CONTESTED REALISMS

IT IS AMUSING IS TO SEE FADDISH SENSIBILITIES TROTTED OUT AS IF HOBBY HORSES EAST G VEGETARIANISM EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM WERE SOMEHOW EXEMPT THERE ARE NO KNOCK DOWN PHILOSOPHICAL ANSWERS TO BE HAD WHICH RATHER DEFLATES THE NOTION THAT ONE MUST OFFER A PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION SUCH AS IS IT OK TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD

TRUE WE CANNOT ESCAPE DOING ETHICS AS A PRACTICAL FACT OF LIFE JUST AS A HARD DETERMINIST CANNOT HELP BUT PRACTICALLY ACT UNDER THE IDEA OF FREEDOM WHEN MAKING A CHOICE IN BOTH CASES IF WE DON'T THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH HOWEVER WE CAN GET BY JUST FINE WE CAN REASON IN TERMS OF OUR MORAL SENTIMENTS AND CULTURAL VALUES AND WORK OUT ANSWERS TO PRACTICAL NORMATIVE QUESTIONS AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT IN THE GRIPS OF PHILOSOPHY THE DETERMINIST CAN MAKE CHOICES ALL DAY WITHOUT PROBLEMS YOU DON'T NEED DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL ANSWERS TO GET BY WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE PHILOSOPHERS HAVE FAILED TO PRODUCE THEM THEY ONLY DIG DEEPER INTO ISSUES AND AND PROLIFERATE NEVER-ENDING POSITIONS AND PERSPECTIVES AND THAT'S GREAT SO LONG AS YOU DON'T TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY

SO IS IT OK TO KILL PIGS FOR FOOD THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION DOES NOT COME FROM THE SWAMP OF PHILOSOPHY BUT SENSIBILITIES OF TIME AND PLACE THE ANSWER FOR NOW IS YES WHEN OUR SENSIBILITIES CHANGE THE ANSWER WILL BE NUMBER IF THIS OFFENDS THE PHILOSOPHER THEN IT IS UP TO HER TO PRODUCE THAT ANSWER REASON WITH A CAPITAL R WHICH WOULD COMPEL EVEN THE MOST FEISTY AND DEXTEROUS OF PRACTICING PHILOSOPHERS PIN YOUR COMMUNITY TO AN ANSWER PRODUCE CONSENSUS OR NEAR CONSENSUS SUCH AS WE FIND IN THE SCIENCES AND THEN TROUBLE US


ANIMAL ETHICS PRESUPPOSES A NEED FOR SUCH ETHICS IF YOU A PRIORI BELIEVE ANIMALS ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE ABILITY TO THINK AND THEREFORE ACT WITH RATIONALE THEN THE ANSWER WOULD BE NUMBER BUT IF ANIMALS ARE INDEED LYING ON A SPECTRUM FROM DESCARTES AUTOMATA TO AN EVOLUTIONARY MODEL OF SOME UNIQUE BEHAVIOR THAT MAY CLASSIFY IT AS SOMEWHAT INTELLIGENT AS TO REQUIRE SOME CARE IN THIS WAY YES YOU COULD ETHICALLY EAT THE ANIMAL IF IT IS KILLED SOMEWHAT HUMANLY THOUGH THAT WORD SUGGESTS THAT WE KNOW HOW TO KILL GENTLY

I'M OF THE PERSONAL BELIEF THAT ETHICS HERE IS MISPLACED IT IS MORE ABOUT HUMAN TO HUMAN BELIEF STRUCTURES AROUND PAIN AND SUFFERING THAN ANY INTRINSIC VALUE THE ANIMALS HAVE AS BEINGS IT IS CLEAR THOUGH THAT A GOOD STEAK HAS ITS OWN VALUE
THIS CONVERSATION ENDS AT THE PART ABOUT THE ALIENS

YES YES IT IS OK FOR AN ALIEN TO EAT US IF THEY ARE ADVANCED ENOUGH TO SUBJUGATE US TO THAT EXTANT THAN THEY ARE IN THE RIGHT TO DO WHAT THEY WISH

THE GENETIC MAKE UP IS THE ONLY THING WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHICH ONE OF US IS THE FITTEST TO SURVIVE THIS IS THE MOST RUDIMENTARY LAW OF NATURE IF THEY ARE STRONGER SMARTER OR MORE ADVANCED THEN THEY WOULD BE THE ONES DISCUSSING THIS MORAL QUESTION AND WE WOULD BE THE PIG
THAT WAS SHITTY LOGIC THAT WAS SEEMINGLY PRESENTED AS AN UNBIASED AND THOUGHTFUL PROCESS OF BREAKING DOWN A VERY COMPLICATED QUESTION I'M ALL FOR EATING LESS ANIMALS I BARELY EAT MEAT AS IT IS AND I THINK PEOPLE DEPEND ON IT FAR TOO MUCH BUT IMO AT THE END OF THE DAY AT ITS MOST BASE VALUE IT'S ENERGY TRANSFER THAT'S BASED UPON WHAT OUR BODIES CAN EASILY BREAK DOWN AND CONVERT TO FUNCTIONS FOR OUR SURVIVAL AND COMFORT WHICH IS WHAT EVERY CREATURE MAN OR BEAST SEEKS OUT

IS IT MORALLY WRONG TO EAT PEOPLE SURE THAT'S A DICK MOVE YOU SHOULDN'T EAT LARRY HE'S A GOOD GUY BUT NOT ONLY IS IT WRONG IT ALSO FUCKS WITH ALMOST EVERY PART OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY AND THEREFORE SURVIVAL BRAIN DISEASES AND A BUNCH OF OTHER CRAP COME WITH THAT SO THAT'S A BIG REASON IT'S BASED ON OUR BODIES TELLING US HEY FUCKER DON'T DO THAT MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOMETIMES OUR BODIES SAY GOD DAMN SOME SALMON AND RICE SOUNDS FUCKING AMAZING RIGHT NOW

IS IT BECAUSE OUR DNA IS DIFFERENT WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL FILTER ON OUR APPETITE THAT CONTOURS TO DNA AND CONSIDERING THAT A HUGE PORTION OF MEAT IN AFRICA IS COMPROMISED OF APES AND CHIMPS AND THEY SHARE ABOUT OF OUR DNA I DOUBT THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT

I THINK TO GET HUNG UP ON WHETHER IT'S MORALLY WRONG TO DO THIS IS A BIT OFFICIAL LIKE I SAID BEFORE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ENERGY TRANSFER WE EAT THESE ANIMALS AS WELL AS PLANTS WHICH GETS TRANSFERRED INTO OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY FOR OTHER THINGS WE DIE OUR BODIES ARE RELEASED BACK INTO THE EARTH THROUGH DECOMPOSITION WORMS TAKE THAT IN OR THE PLANTS FEED OFF IT AND GROW AND ARE EATEN ETC ETC WE TRY TO FIND ENERGY SOURCES THAT DOESN'T FUCK WITH OUR PHYSIOLOGY DETRIMENTALLY IS TASTY AND MAKES US FEEL GOOD

IMO MUCH LIKE MOST THINGS IN THIS WORLD MEAT SHOULD BE ENJOYED IN MODERATION SAME THING WITH PLANTS TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING IS A BAD THING BALANCE SHOULD BE APPLIED IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE BUT TO ATTACH A MORAL ARGUMENT TO THIS IS ODD NOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES FROM THE MEAT INDUSTRY THAT'S A GOOD ARGUMENT YOU CAN BACK THAT UP WITH FACTS STATISTICS EVIDENCE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SCIENCE MORALS ARE BASED UPON ONE'S UNDERSTANDING OF THEM AND ARE COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE SO THIS GUY SHOULD JUST MAKE HIS CHOICE BETWEEN MORNING STAR OR JIMMY DEAN AND MOVE ON WITH LIFE
I HAVE DECIDED TO EXTRAPOLATE THIS ARGUMENT IT IS NOT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL ANY LIFE FOR FOOD THEREFORE I CANNOT KILL A PLANT BECAUSE DESPITE SOME PLANTS BEING MORE INTELLIGENT THAN MAMMALS THEY ARE ALIVE AND I DO NOT NEED TO EAT PLANTS TO LIVE

BUT WAIT IF I VALUE LIFE LIVING ORGANISMS AND BELIEVE MORALITY IS MORE THAN A CONSTRUCT OF HUMAN SOCIETY THEN I AM BACK TO THE ISLAND SITUATION OF HAVING TO EAT WHAT I'M PRESENTED WITH

YES VEGETARIANS DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT PLANTS LIVE AND THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DIE DESPITE SCIENCE CLEARY SHOWING THAT PLANTS FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL IN THEIR OWN WAY

THE MORALITY OF FOOD IS ODDLY POSITIONED TOWARDS MAMMALS BUT IF YOU CAN FEEL MORALLY WRONG FOR EATING AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES THEN PLEASE PUT VEGETATION ON YOUR LIST
I THINK MY ORIGINAL IDEA TO RESPOND TO THE EATING OF ANIMALS IDEA WAS THE WRONG ANGLE

THE TRUE QUESTION ASKED HERE IS WHAT IS MORALITY

IT'S A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT THAT IS EVER CHANGING AND VARIES BY CULTURE SOCIAL CIRCLES OR INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATION

THE FACT THAT KILLING A FISH IS SEEN AS ACCEPTABLE AND KILLING A RABBIT MIGHT NOT BE IS A NICE EXAMPLE OF WHY I AT THE VEGETARIAN TYPE ARGUMENT JUST DON'T EAT ME BUZ I PLAN TO DIE QUIETLY IN MY SLEEP
WHY SO MUCH EMPHASIS ON MORALS WE ARE ANIMALS THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE MORALS IS BECAUSE LAWS DICTATE THAT WE MUST HAVE THEM OR WE'LL GET PUNISHED IF LAWS DIDN'T EXIST THEY'D BE CHAOS ALSO IT'S MORAL BECAUSE MEAT EATERS DEEM IT SO WHAT'S MORAL IS SUBJECTIVE
THE VIDEO IS MOSTLY A STRAW MANUAL BECAUSE HE DOESN'T ADDRESS THE STRONGEST REASONING FOR WHY IT'S OKAY TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD IN ALL OF HIS SEARCHING FOR DIFFERENCES HE FAILS TO UNDERSTAND THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT DIFFERENCE IS WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS IT ABOUT HUMANS THAT MAKES IT IMMORAL TO KILL US BECAUSE IN THE VIDEO HIS ARGUMENT BOILS DOWN TO THE ILLOGICAL CONCLUSION THAT IT SEEMS WRONG THEREFORE WE SHOULDN'T DO IT WELL WHY DOES IT SEEM WRONG BECAUSE MOST WESTERNIZED HUMANS BELIEVE IN THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN RIGHTS THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN MUCH OF PHILOSOPHY THERE IS NO REASONING GIVEN FOR HUMAN RIGHTS EVEN JOHN LOCKE DESCRIBES IT AS A GOD GIVEN RIGHT BUT TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE DIFFEREN BETWEEN HUMANS AND ANIMALS WE HAVE TO ASK WHY WE HAVE DECIDED THAT HUMANS SHOULD HAVE RIGHTS AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT IT ISN'T INTELLIGENCE NECESSARILY ALTHOUGH THIS PLAYS A NECESSARY PART IT IS THE ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE SUFFERING IN OTHER WORDS A SORT OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AN AWARENESS OF YOUR EXISTENCE A VALUING OF YOUR EXISTENCE AND THE CAPABILITY TO EXPERIENCE LOSS IF YOUR EXISTENCE IS TAKEN AWAY

AND QUITE SIMPLY PUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO EXIST IN ANIMALS WE HAVE VERIFIED THAT ANIMALS EXPERIENCE PAIN AND SOME TAKE THIS TO MEAN THAT THEY MUST THEN BE EXPERIENCING SUFFERING BUT THE NEUROLOGICAL PAIN RESPONSE AND THE ABILITY TO EMOTIONALLY PROCESS THIS ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS

THE SECOND COMPONENT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN ITSELF OR SUFFERING THE INTERNAL EMOTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF THE NOCICEPTIVE EXPERIENCE AGAIN IN HUMANS THIS IS WHEN THE WITHDRAWN FINGER BEGINS TO HURT MOMENTS AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL PAIN IS THEREFORE A PRIVATE EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE PAIN CANNOT BE DIRECTLY MEASURED IN OTHER ANIMALS INCLUDING OTHER HUMANS RESPONSES TO PUTATIVELY PAINFUL STIMULI CAN BE MEASURED BUT NOT THE EXPERIENCE ITSELF


WIKI

TO ILLUSTRATE THIS POINT TAKE THE FILM LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS WHERE BILL MURRAY PLAYS A MASOCHISTIC DENTAL PATIENT WHO EXPERIENCES EXTREME PLEASURE FROM THE NEUROLOGICAL RESPONSE OF PAIN OR PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THE PAIN OF TATTOOS THESE ARE EXAMPLES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO PAIN CAN BE EXTREMELY VARIED AND THAT JUST BECAUSE AN ANIMAL DEMONSTRATES AN PHYSICAL PAIN RESPONSE STIMULUS DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS SUFFERING BY ANY SENSE OF THE WORD

BY ASSUMING THAT THE ANIMAL IS SUFFERING BECAUSE IT EXPERIENCES PAIN IS AS ANTHROPOMORPHICAL AS ASSUMING THAT BECAUSE A COW HAS VOCAL CHORDS IT HAS THE CAPABILITY OF LEARNING LANGUAGE

I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS HIS INTELLECTUALLY DISABLE COMMENT BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY IF A HUMAN BEING IS INCAPABLE OF EXPERIENCING SUFFERING THERE IS NO MORAL WRONG IN KILLING THE PERSON IT'S SIMPLY OUR CULTURAL AND PERHAPS BIOLOGICAL ASSUMPTION TO ASSUME THAT KILLING SOMEONE OR HARMING THEM WILL EXPERIENCE SUFFERING THAT CAUSES IT TO SEEM WRONG

THIS DOESN'T MEAN HOWEVER THAT WE SHOULD KILL INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED PEOPLE BECAUSE THE ATTACHMENT THAT FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE TO THESE PEOPLE IS REAL EVEN IF THEY DO NOT EXPERIENCE SUFFERING THEREFORE IT WOULD CAUSE EMOTIONAL SUFFERING TO A PERSON WHO IS CAPABLE OF EXPERIENCES EMOTIONAL SUFFERING TO DO THAT

I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE MORE GLARING ERRORS IN THIS ARGUMENT EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T EVEN NECESSARY BECAUSE HE BASIS THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF HIS ARGUMENT ON SOMETHING SEEMING TO BE WRONG
Q IS IT OK TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD

A IT DEPENDS WHO'S ASKING
BUT HE IS MISSING AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHY WE KILL THEM WE KILL THEM BECAUSE WE DOMESTICATED THEM FOR FOOD AND WE RAISED THEM FOR FOOD THEN HE MIGHT ASK IF IT WAS MORALLY PERMISSIBLE FOR HUMANS TO DOMESTICATE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE I WOULD STILL SAY YES BECAUSE WHEN WE DID DOMESTICATED PIGS WE NEEDED TO IT WAS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FOOD FOR WHATEVER GROUP OF PEOPLE DOMESTICATED PIGS
REMOVED
I'M FAIRLY NEW TO THIS WHOLE PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE THING SO FEEL FREE TO CORRECT ME AT ANY POINT ALONG THE WAY BUT I FOUND A FEW ARGUMENTS IN THIS VIDEO FAIRLY INCOMPLETE
THE ONE KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE AND PIGS THAT IS NEVER MENTIONED IS PURPOSE NO MATTER YOUR MENTAL OR PHYSICAL FITNESS EVERY HUMAN HAS A LIFE PURPOSE BEYOND SIMPLY EXISTING AND DYING
PIGS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE BRED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF EVENTUALLY BECOMING FOOD AS LONG AS THEY ARE TREATED IN A HUMANE WAY THAT IMPOSES NO UNNECESSARY SUFFERING I SEE NO ISSUE WITH PIGS FULFILLING SUCH A PURPOSE
THIS IS NOT TO SAY A PIGS PURPOSE CANNOT CHANGE THIS IS NOT TO SAY A PERSON'S PURPOSE CANNOT CHANGE THIS IS WHERE THE CARING ASPECT OF THINGS COMES INTO PLAY WHICH I ALSO THOUGHT WAS NOT COMPLETELY ADDRESSED
IMAGINE A WEB TYPE OF SITUATION THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT EVERYONE READING THE BOOK WOULD BE MORALLY OPPOSED TO THE PIG BEING KILLED WHY BECAUSE THE LITTLE GIRL CARED ABOUT IT THIS CHANGED ITS PURPOSE FROM BEING FOOD TO BEING A FRIEND
AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN MANY CHINESE CULTURES DOGS ARE KILLED FOR FOOD THIS MAY SEEM MORALLY WRONG TO MANY PEOPLE IN WESTERN SOCIETY AS FOR US A DOG'S PURPOSE IS TO BE A COMPANION AND A FRIEND
SO REALLY IT IS THE PIG'S PURPOSE NOT IT'S THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORALLY WRONG TO KILL
TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION LET ME MAKE A SORT OF INANE QUESTION OF MY OWN IS IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL ANYTHING FOR FOOD IT'S A SILLY QUESTION BUT I THINK IT'S ONE THAT GOES WELL WITH THE QUESTION BEING ASKED OF US

AS A MORE EXTREME VERSION OF BEING TRAPPED ON AN ISLAND WITH NOTHING ELSE BUT A PIG TO EAT WE'RE ALL MAROONED ON THIS PLANET WITH NOTHING BUT PLANTS AND ANIMALS TO EAT SO WE MAKE DO WITH WHAT WE HAVE ON THIS PLANET SO IS IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CHOICE

AND IN THE SAME VEIN AS THE WE DON'T NEED TO EAT PIGS ARGUMENT WE ALSO DON'T NEED TO EAT KALE SANDWICHES WE COULD ALL JUST EAT MEAT IS IT PRACTICAL NO OF COURSE NOT BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT OF PRACTICALITY BUT OF MORALITY

ALL THE ARGUMENTS REVOLVE AROUND THE VALUE OF THE PIG COMPARED TO PEOPLE WHAT ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE PIG COMPARED TO THE KALE WE COULD EAT INSTEAD A VALUE THAT I WOULD ARGUABLY SAY IS SUBJECTIVE A PRODUCT OF THE VERY GENETIC MAKEUP THAT MAKES US DIFFERENT FROM PIGS OR PLANTS AND WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS THAT MORALITY WOULD BE NONEXISTENT OR AT LEAST COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE CHEMICALS IN OUR BRAIN THAT MAKE US SYMPATHETIC

I THINK THE MORALITY OF KILLING A PIG FOR FOOD DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON THE VALUE EACH INDIVIDUAL OR CULTURE PLACES ON THE PIG

AS I SAID IN A PREVIOUS COMMENT MORALITY IS SUBJECTIVE AND THE MORALITY OF WHAT TO KILL FOR FOOD DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON THE VALUE WE PLACE ON THE LIFE IN QUESTION UNTIL WE CAN SYNTHESIZE FOOD FROM PURE ENERGY I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT'S MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL PIGS FOR FOOD WHAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY CONSIDER IS THE PRACTICALITY OF IT THE IMPACT OF IT ON THE PLANET AS WELL AS THE SPACE THEY'RE OCCUPYING AS WE MOVE FORWARD
I THINK THERE'S TWO POINTS WHICH DON'T PRESENT AS STRONG AN ARGUMENT

DNA IT IS MORALLY WRONG FOR HUMANS TO KILL HUMANS AS IT DOES NOT FURTHER THE HUMAN RACE HE ARGUED THAT IT WOULD BE MORALLY WRONG FOR ALIENS TO KILL HUMANS FOR FOOD WHICH I DISAGREE WE CAN'T JUDGE WHAT'S MORAL FOR AN ALIEN RACE AND THOUGH I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE KILLED FOR FOOD IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO PERCEIVE WHAT THOSE ALIEN'S MORAL STANDARDS ARE

2 FOOD CHAIN IT'S IN OUR NATURE TO KILL FOR SUSTENANCE WHICH BECAME OUR NATURE TO KILL FOR NUTRITION AND EVENTUALLY OUR TASTE DESIRES THIS MORALITY CAN CHANGE OVER CENTURIES AND GENERATIONS BUT WE'RE STILL IN THAT MINDSET WHERE OUR MORALITY IS A FEW STEPS BEHIND ALONG WITH OUR STAGE OF NATURAL EVOLUTION


I HOPE HE DOES A FOLLOW-UP VIDEO HE DIDN'T MENTION CONSPICUOUS MESS AS A POTENTIAL REASON WHY KILLING PIGS COULD BE MORALLY PERMISSIBLE THERE ARE OTHER REASONS I WANT TO SEE HIM EXPLORE
THIS IS SUCH AN OPINIONATED QUESTION SOME MAY SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT BECAUSE IT'S CRUEL SOME MAY SAY YES BECAUSE IF YOU ARE A CHRISTIAN GOD GAVE MAN DOMINION OVER ANIMALS AND SOME MAY SAY YES BECAUSE IN THE WILD OTHER OMNIVORES EAT ANIMALS AND WE ARE JUST SMART OMNIVORES AN OPINIONATED QUESTION CAN NEVER BE ANSWERED
I SEE NO REASON WHY IT'S IMPERMISSIBLE FOR ALIENS TO KILL HUMANS FOR FOOD I THINK WE ARE JUST TOO BIASED TO SEE THAT THE AUTHOR IS CORRECT THAT IT IS THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIED TO US AND PIGS BUT WRONG ABOUT WHETHER IT IS PERMISSIBLE OR NOT IN THE ALIEN EXAMPLE


IF IT'S PERMISSIBLE TO KILL HUMANS FOR FOOD IT'S PERMISSIBLE TO KILL PIGS FOR FOOD


THE ALIEN EXAMPLE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME I DON'T HAVE A MORAL PROBLEM WITH ALIENS EATING HUMANS I HAVE A PRACTICAL PROBLEM WITH THEM DOING SO BUT NOT A MORAL ONE SAME GOES FOR EATING PEOPLE FOR FOOD GENERALLY I DON'T REALLY SEE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IN FACT THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE THAN ENOUGH CULTURES ON EARTH IN WHICH THIS PRACTICE IS ACCEPTABLE I DON'T THINK WE LIKE TO HOLD THAT IDEA AS A WESTERN SOCIETY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T HOLD IN SOME SOCIETY

MY MOST MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO IS HIM SAYING THAT SOME THINGS ARE WRONG WITHOUT EXPLAINING ON WHICH BASIS HE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE MORALLY WRONG AT THE VERY END I FELT LIKE HE GAVE ME SOME PRETTY GOOD REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD IS OK THE ALIEN ONE FOR EXAMPLE IS A GREAT IDEA
BY THE LOGIC IN THIS VIDEO IT SEEMS EQUALLY TRUE THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO KILL A PLANT FOR FOOD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE INTELLIGENCE PART OF THIS ARGUMENT IS VASTLY OVER SIMPLIFIED AS THAT WOULD MAKE THE BEST CASE FOR IT BEING MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL SOME KALE AS WELL WE DO HAVE MORAL ARGUMENTS FOR WHY IT IS OKAY TO KILL SOMEBODY OF A PARTICULARLY LOW INTELLIGENCE THAT BEING PEOPLE ON LIFE SUPPORT WITH AN INTELLIGENCE SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE EFFECTIVELY NO BRAIN FUNCTION IT IS STILL IMPERMISSIBLE TO EAT THAT PERSON BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO KILL THEM BY UNPLUGGING A MACHINE

THIS WOULD IMPLY THAT INTELLIGENCE IS THE ANSWER AND IT SUGGESTS THAT THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS IT OK TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD WOULD BE YES SOMETIMES FOLLOWED BY THE CREATION OF A SPECTRUM OF ANIMALS LEADING TO A POINT WHERE IT IS PERHAPS A PIG IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF AN ANIMAL WE SHOULD NOT EAT BUT CERTAIN ANIMALS LIKE OYSTERS ARE OF SUFFICIENTLY LOW INTELLIGENCE OR SENTIENCE THAT THEY CAN BE EATEN

EDIT I KNOW THE ETHICS OF REMOVING SOMEONE FROM LIFE SUPPORT IS DEBATED I AM SIMPLY DRAWING THE COMPARISON BECAUSE IT IS ANOTHER ETHICAL DILEMMA WHERE PEOPLE ARGUE THAT IT IS ETHICAL TO KILL A HUMAN WHO WOULD DO YOU NO HARM BASED ON INTELLIGENCE
I'VE BEEN ASKING THIS QUESTION FOR YEARS AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH NO I'VE NEVER HEARD A SINGLE MORAL ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF IT IT TENDS TO COME DOWN TO THEY'RE ANIMALS WE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT WITH THEM THE SPECIESISM
I READ AN ARTICLE ON WISH I COULD REMEMBER THE SOURCE ANOTHER UNRELATED THREAD ABOUT A TRIBE IN AFRICA I BELIEVE COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THE DETAILS WHO HAD NO MORAL PROBLEM WITH EATING THEIR DEAD RELATIVES IN FACT THEY VIEWED IT AS A MERGING OR AN EXTENDING OF THEIR SAID FAMILY MEMBERS SPIRITUAL FORCE ONCE A PERSON WOULD DIE THEY WOULD PUT THEM IN THE GROUND UNTIL THEY WERE NICE AND RIPE WITH MAGGOTS THEN PROCEED TO EAT THE HEART BRAINS ETC RATIONALIZING THAT THE DEAD PERSONS SPIRIT WOULD LIVE ON THROUGH THEM

LONG STORY SHORT THEY ENDED UP CONTRIBUTING ONE OF THE MOST DEADLY AND UNTRACEABLE DISEASES TO THIS WORLD TO THE POINT THAT DOCTORS THAT KNOW ABOUT IT WILL RUN AWAY FROM ANY PATIENT THAT MAY HAVE COME IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE DIED FROM SAID DISEASE

AGAIN WISH I COULD PROVIDE A LINK OR SITE THE SOURCE OR THE NAME OF THIS DISEASE MAYBE SOMEONE COULD HELP WITH THIS

ALL I KNOW IS THAT IT IS THE NASTIEST SICKNESS KNOWN TO MAN NO SYMPTOMS NO CURE NO TESTAMENT CAN BE CARRIED AND COMMUNICATED WITHOUT THE HOST EVEN KNOWING END RESULT SUDDEN HORRIFIC AND EXTREMELY PAINFUL DEATH

ALL AS A RESULT OF PEOPLE EATING PEOPLE EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE EATING THEM OUT OF REVERENCE AND RESPECT
I DISAGREE WITH HIS ALIEN EXAMPLE IF SOME INTERGALACTIC SPECIES REVEALED ITSELF AND TOLD HUMANITY THEY HAD BEEN FARMING US FOR FOOD I DON'T THINK WE WOULD REACT THE WAY THE VIDEO SAYS WE WOULD I DOUBT WE WOULD ARGUE WITH A SUPERIOR SPECIES THAT WE ARE TOO SPECIAL TO KILL

REALLY ITS OKAY TO KILL ANIMALS AND PEOPLE FOR FOOD SOCIETY HAS JUST DECIDED THAT ONE IS MORALLY WRONG TO DO IF YOU LEAVE OUT HUMAN CREATED CONCEPTS ITS ALL JUST MEAT AND OUR BODIES ARE OPTIMIZED FOR MEAT IN OUR DAILY DIET
WHY ARE WE SO QUICK TO DISCOUNT LIFE THAT IS NOT MAMMALIAN WHEAT IS ALIVE HAS DNA SPENDS TIME ENSURING THE NEST GENERATION WILL LIVE ON AND ITS SOURCE OF NUTRITION IS PRIMARILY SOLAR EAT THE ANIMALS DESTROYING ALL THE PLANTS PLANTS WERE HERE FIRST
I SEE IT LIKE THIS IN THE WILD A LION OR TIGER OR ANY OTHER PREDATOR OR HORRID DISEASE WOULD GET THEM AND THEY WOULD DIE IN AGONY THEY WOULD RATHER ME KILL THEM INSTANTLY AND EAT THEIR CORPSE THEY ONLY GET OF THOSE 2 CHOICES
FOR ME IT'S LANGUAGE I WOULD NEVER EAT ANYBODY WHO HAS OR HAS POTENTIAL TO HAVE LANGUAGE WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND IS A LANGUAGE OF COURSE WE USE LANGUAGE TO MODEL FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS OF OTHERS AND THOSE WHO DO DO NOT POSSESS LANGUAGE WE FEEL VERY MUCH BENEATH US AND NOT HAVING THE SAME LEVEL OF MENTAL FACULTIES PIG CANNOT REALLY TELL ME WHAT IT FEELS IT CAN COMMUNICATE ON MORE PRIMITIVE LEVEL WITH A SIGNAL SYSTEM THAT WE PARTLY SHARE SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW FEAR OR FURY LOOKS LIKE BUT IT CANNOT REASON WITH ME GIVE ME ANY ARGUMENTS FOR ITS PROLONGED EXISTENCE
I THINK IT'S IN PART WHY IT IS MUCH EASIER TO KILL PEOPLE FROM OTHER CULTURES THAT DO NOT SHARE LANGUAGE WITH YOUR CULTURE
LANGUAGE IS ONE OF THOSE VERY STRONGLY HELD IDENTITIES HERE IN CATALUNYA YOU CAN FEEL IT VERY STRONGLY FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS ON AGENDA WAS TO PROHIBIT CATALAN AND PAINT NOT AS A REAL THING AND THIS AUTOMATICALLY DISQUALIFIES CATALUNYA FROM HAVING ANY REAL CULTURE IN THE EYES OF THE SPANISH WHO IN TURN HATE TO HEAR CATALAN BECAUSE IT'S WRONG AND CHALLENGES THEIR IDENTITY THAT'S WHAT FRENCH DID WITH OCCITAN AS WELL I AM NOT CATALAN BTW SO I HAVE NO STAKE IN THIS IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE THAT I CAN SEE PERSONALLY THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN RUSSIA UKRAINE IDENTITY CONFLICT
AS FOR CATS AND DOGS YOU KNOW WE ACTUALLY TALK TO THEM AND PROJECT OUR OWN LANGUAGE INTO THEIR REACTIONS IMAGINING ANSWERS IN OUR HEADS REALLY I EVEN TALK WITH MY TOY WOLVES AND THEY ANSWER ALBEIT SILENTLY BUT IT'S JUST MY BRAIN MODELLING BOTH SIDES OF THIS CONVERSATION BUT I AM REALLY ATTACHED TO THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE PERSONALITIES NOW AND I'D BE VERY SAD IF SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM
SORRY FOR THE MESS THESE ARE JUST QUICK THOUGHTS I HAVE NO FIRM POSITION
I THINK THE ARGUMENT AGAINST EATING ANIMALS BREAKS DOWN WHEN HE REFUTES THE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE AND PIGS ARE PIGS ARGUMENT WHERE HE REASONS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A MORAL OBJECTION IF ALIENS DID THE SAME TO US

I DON'T THINK THAT OUR HUMAN MORALITY APPLIES TO OTHER SPECIES WE DON'T QUESTION THE MORALITY OF SHARKS EATING SEALS OR HAWKS EATING RABBITS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PEOPLE OUR RULES JUST DON'T APPLY

FURTHER IF A DIFFERENT MORE ADVANCED SPECIES CAME AROUND THEY WOULD MORE OR LESS JUST BE LIKE ANOTHER FORCE OF NATURE TO US WITH MOTIVES AND INTELLECT THAT WE DON'T COMPREHEND IN THAT WAY I DON'T THINK THAT WE WOULD HAVE ANY MORE GROUNDS TO QUESTION THE MORALITY OF ALIENS KILLING US THAN WE DO THE MORALITY OF HURRICANES TSUNAMIS OR GOD IF YOU'RE THE SORT THAT BELIEVES IN A HIGHER POWER
TO JUSTIFY VIOLENCE YOU MUST DEMONSTRATE WHY IT IS NECESSARY I HAD TO SHOOT THE MAN BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO KILL THE CHILD

IN ALMOST ALL SITUATIONS ASIDE FROM SURVIVAL SCENARIOS WHERE CANNIBALISM AND AUTO CANNIBALISM IS ALSO POTENTIALLY JUSTIFIABLE THERE IS NO NEED FOR A HUMAN TO EAT OR WEAR ANY ANIMAL PRODUCTS IS FORTIFIED IN PLANT BASED MILKS AND OTHER FOODS OR CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED IF YOU WANT ENERGY YOU SHOULD TAKE IT EVEN IF YOURE AN OMNIVORE PROTEIN AND AMINO ACIDS ARE IN SEVERAL PLANT FOODS HEALTHY FATS ARE IN SEVERAL PLANT FOODS I LOST LBS OF FAT AND FEEL FANTASTIC TRY IT
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT LET'S ASSUME IT'S VITALLY NECESSARY FOR HUMANS TO EAT FOODS TO ENSURE THEIR OWN SURVIVAL I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT BEAR WITH ME

IS IT JUSTIFIABLE THEN TO KILL FAR MORE ANIMALS THAN NECESSARY BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE TO SATISFY NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS OR SHOULD WE ONLY EAT THE MINIMUM NECESSARY RECOGNIZING THAT MORE THAN THAT IS DONE FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN SHORT TERM PLEASURE AND THE ANIMALS ARE UNDULY SUFFERING TO PROVIDE THAT PLEASURE

PUT MORE SIMPLY HOW DOES ONE ETHICALLY JUSTIFY EATING SAY OR POUNDS OF FOODS EVERY DAY WHEN OZ OR LESS OF FOODS PER WEEK WOULD SUFFICE NUTRITIONALLY
WOULD IT BE ETHICAL TO ENGAGE IN THE FOLLOWING LOGIC AGREE THAT KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD IS NOT AN IDEAL STATE FOR HUMAN SOCIETY HOWEVER CONTINUE TO EAT MEAT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THAT A LARGE ENOUGH PORTION OF SOCIETY WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT THE MEAT INDUSTRY SUCH THAT YOUR INDIVIDUAL DECISION WILL HAVE NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT ON REDUCING ANIMAL SUFFERING EVEN IN THE LONG TERM THEREFORE YOU CONCLUDE THERE IS NO ETHICAL COMPULSION TO INFLICT SUFFERING UPON YOURSELF BY DENYING YOURSELF THE PLEASURE OF EATING MEAT

HOWEVER YOU MAINTAIN THAT YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY SIGN ANY PETITION OR VOTE IN ANY REFERENDUM RESTRICTING PROHIBITING THE SALE OF MEAT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU BELIEVE THAT THE PROBABILITY OF SUCH A LAW PASSING IS ALSO CLOSE TO ZERO THE SUFFERING YOU INFLICT UPON YOURSELF BY SIGNING VOTING IS CLOSE TO ZERO AS WELL YOU ALSO MAINTAIN THAT YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY BECOME VEGETARIAN IF YOU WERE EVER CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL POSSIBILITY THAT ENOUGH CONSUMERS COULD BE RALLIED TO TOPPLE THE MEAT INDUSTRY

NOTE THERE MAY BE EVIDENCE OF PEOPLE'S VEGETARIANISM HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE MEAT INDUSTRY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SCENARIO YOU FOR WHATEVER REASON FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT YOUR PERSONAL EATING HABITS WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE ANIMALS ACTUAL SUFFERING
ALRIGHT FOUND THIS ARTICLE RELEVANT

IT MAY HAVE BEEN NATURAL DURING THE CAVEMAN ERA BUT WE NOW LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PEOPLE IN INDIA HAVE GONE WITHOUT THE CONSUMPTION OF MEAT AND THEY ARE STILL ABLE TO PROSPER WE ARE NOT IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE STARVING OR ANIMALS ARE OUR ONLY SOURCE OF FOOD KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD IS DONE NOW IN THIS TIME OUT OF CONVENIENCE AND TRADITION NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH CHANGE BREAKING TRADITION OR HAVING TO WORK HARDER FOR SOMETHING

I LIKED THE VIDEO VERY MUCH PEOPLE MAY GET MAD AT THE IDEA BUT THERE IS NO GOOD MORAL REASON TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD
MAYBE I MISSED IT BUT DID THE VIDEO EVER BRING UP SENTIENCE PIGS HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF PAST OR FUTURE THEY DON'T HAVE VALUES BELIEFS SYSTEMS GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS THIS IS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN LOOKING AT A PIG'S LINGUISTICS
THIS IS ON TOP OF THE FACT THAT EATING MEAT DOES IN MANY WAYS FUEL OUR BODIES WHICH CAN'T BE SAID ABOUT HUMANS WHICH ARE EXTREMELY CALORIC AND FATTENING
ANIMALS KILL OTHER ANIMALS FOR FOOD

HUMANS KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD

WE'RE JUST AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN

SO WHY WOULD WE BE MORALLY WRONG TO KILL EAT ANIMALS YES WE COULD ALL JUST EAT KALE SANDWICHES BUT IMAGINE A WORLD WITH ALL VEGETARIANS WE'D BE OVERPOPULATED WITH PEOPLE AND ANIMALS
WHAT EXACTLY IS A LION SUPPOSED TO EAT
NO BUT PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS LOOK FOR REASONS TO FULFILL THEIR ADDICTIONS GRASPING FOR STRAWS LIKE ASSOCIATING MEAT WITH MASCULINITY AND UNVOTING ANECDOTES THAT SUPPORT THEIR ADDICTION AND THEN LOOKING AWAY FROM THE RATIONAL COUNTERPOINTS THEN THEY TURN AROUND AND SAY A PRAYER TO THEIR GOD BEFORE EATING THE CORPSES OF THEIR FACTORY FARMED TURDUCKEN
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD 2 POINTS TO CONSIDER WHICH I DON'T SEE CONSIDERED VERY OFTEN

POINT IF A PREY ANIMAL ISN'T SLAUGHTERED HUMANELY FOR FOOD WHAT OTHER DEATHS ARE AVAILABLE TO IT PRESUMABLY IF WE DIDN'T FARM THEM FOR FOOD WE WOULD LET THEM RUN FREE THE DEATHS AVAILABLE IN THE WILD ALL SEEM RATHER UNPLEASANT TO BE CHASED DOWN AND EATEN PROBABLY WHILE STILL ALIVE TO SUFFER SOME KIND OF DAMAGE OR DISEASE LEADING TO DEATH TO FAIL TO FIND OR BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FOOD AND WATER TO CONTINUE TO SURVIVE IS ANY OF THAT PREFERABLE TO HUMANE SLAUGHTER

POINT 2 WOULD IT BE WRONG TO FORCE DIFFERENT INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES TO STOP THEIR TRADITIONAL DIETS AND HUNTING PRACTICES USUALLY THESE FOLK HAVE EXCEPTIONS TO HUNTING BANS IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CULTURE

BUT I ALSO HAVE A CULTURE AND PART OF THAT IS THE KILLING AND EATING OF MEAT WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THEIR CULTURE AND MY CULTURE THAT I OUGHT TO FORGO THIS PRACTICE
HE IGNORES THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AN INHERENT DESIRE TO PRESERVE THE GENES OF OUR SPECIES BUT NOT THE GENES OF EXPLOITABLE FOOD SOURCES
WHY CAN'T THIS ARGUMENT BE USED TO EXPLAIN WHY IT ISN'T OK TO EAT PLANTS WHICH ARE ALSO LIVING THINGS
THE GUY SEPARATES KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD AND EATING ANIMALS FOR FOOD SURELY THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IF YOU KILL AN ANIMAL FOR FOOD IT THEREFORE IMPLIES ONE SHALL EAT IT EVENTUALLY
REMOVED
I AGREE THAT MASS SLAUGHTER CAN BE OVER THE TOP BUT THE ARGUMENT OF EATING PLANTS OVER ANIMALS IS MOOT TO ME I SEE PLANTS AS ALIVE SINCE THEY GROW AND BREATH THEY MAY NOT HAVE BLOOD LIKE OURS OR BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN SOUNDS THAT WE CAN HEAR BUT THEY ARE ALIVE SO TO ME WE NEED TO EAT LIVING THINGS TO LIVE PULLING A PLANT OUT OF THE GROUND IS NO DIFFERENT THAN HARVESTING A PIG OR CHICKEN

PHILOSOPHIZE THIS PODCAST DID A GREAT EPISODE ON THE SAME SUBJECT
PIGS MIGHT BE AS INTELLIGENT AS YOUNG CHILDREN DO YOU PIG-EATING PEOPLE REALIZE THIS
HE KEEPS ASKING IF IT IS MORAL BUT DOESN'T ESTABLISH WHERE MORALITY COMES FROM IF MORALITY COMES FROM A MAJORITY CENSUS BY SOCIETY THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK IT IS MORAL IF HE IS TRYING TO DECONSTRUCT WHAT AMERICAS MORALITY IS IN ORDER TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THAT WE EAT PIGS BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S MORALLY ACCEPTABLE WE DON'T THINK IT'S MORALLY ACCEPTABLE TO EAT HUMANS IF HE THINKS THAT MORALITY IS TRANSCENDENT OF THOUGHT THEN HE SHOULD ESTABLISH WHERE THAT MORALITY COMES FROM AND HOW WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN EAT FROM THAT
WATCHED VIDEO READ THROUGH OF COMMENTS AND DID NOT SEE ANYTHING REMOTELY CLOSE TO THIS MENTIONED SO THROWING IT OUT THERE TO ADD TO THE MIX AND HOPEFULLY RUFFLE SOME FEATHERS

A IF GOD EXISTS AND MADE PEOPLE ABOVE AND UNIQUELY DIFFERENT THAN ANIMALS THEN WE'VE GOT THE GO-AHEAD TO EAT THEM OR NOT FREE CHOICE BUT OBVIOUSLY NOT PEOPLE AS WE ARE UNIQUELY SET APART

B IF WE'RE ALL JUST A GIANT COSMIC ACCIDENT THEN WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE NOTHING MATTERS AND EVERYTHING IS MERELY SURVIVAL IF EATING ANIMALS HELPS TO DO THAT THEN WOULDN'T IT BE OK
I THINK EVERYONE MAKES REALLY GREAT POINTS IN THIS I BELIEVE THE ISSUE IS A SYMPTOM RATHER THAN A CAUSE THOUGH THERE ARE TOO MANY HUMANS WE DON'T HAVE TO EAT MEAT BUT WE DO THAT BEING SAID AS MUCH AS WE THINK OURSELVES ABOVE NATURE THAT IN AND OF ITSELF MIGHT BE OUR BIGGEST DELUSION WE FALL VICTIM TO OUR PRIMAL VICES EVERY SINGLE DAY OUR ISSUE IS SIMPLY THAT WE ARE BECOMING TOO GOOD AT GETTING WHAT WE WANT BUT WE ARE CLEARLY NOT ADVANCED ENOUGH AS A LINEIFORM TO REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US ESPECIALLY TO PRIORITIZE WHAT WE NEED NOT WANT THIS IMPORTANCE COMES FROM THE FACT THAT WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE SELFISHLY SINCE OUR IMPACT ALONE CAN CHANGE THE VERY WORLD ITSELF WE AS HUMANS ARE VERY GOOD AT JUSTIFYING THESE PRIMAL URGES AS WE GET OLDER THOUGH SO EITHER WAY YOU CUT IT WE AS A SPECIES WILL ALWAYS SEEK THE BENEFIT OF THE SHORT TERM BEFORE THE LONG TERM HUMANS WILL HAVE TRULY COMPREHENDED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS WORLD WHEN WE EMBRACE THE IDEA OF THE ELDER PLANTING A TREE OF WHICH THE SHADE IT BEARS IS ONE HE SHALL NEVER ENJOY ALAS WE DON'T THINK LIKE THIS WE ARE INTELLIGENT YES BUT IT IS BECOMING ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT WITH ALL OUR INTELLIGENCE WE CAN'T COMBAT THE VERY ESSENCE OF WHAT WE ARE AS A LIFE FORM IT'S ALMOST COMEDIC HOW NO MATTER WHAT WE DO TO TRY AND PROVE IT OTHERWISE NATURE WILL INEVITABLY BRING US TO OUR KNEES
THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO YOU SET OUT TO PROVE WHY IT IS MORALLY PERMISSIBLE BUT IN REALITY IT'S NOT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE YOU CAN'T PROVE A FALSE STATEMENT
SOME SOLE REASON FOR EXISTENCE REGARDLESS OF THEIR INTELLIGENCE OR THEIR CAPACITY TO SUFFER IS TO BE A PREY AND KEEP ALIVE OTHER ANIMALS THAT FEED ON THEM OR THEIR REMAINS YOU CANNOT SAVE EVERY ORGANISM FROM SUFFERING BECAUSE BY DOING SO YOU ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTING OTHER SPECIES THAT DEPEND ON THEM SPECIES THAT CAN'T REPRODUCE OR MATURE AS FAST SPECIES THAT FILL OTHER ROLES IN THE FOOD CHAIN SUCH AS HUMANS EVERY LIVING THING HAS A PLACE IN IT BE IT A PLANT OR AN ANIMAL

YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT CATTLE BUT I DON'T SEE ANYONE DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF PLANKTON WHERE MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF ORGANISMS ARE EATEN BY OTHER SPECIES EVERY DAY OH BUT THEY DON'T SUFFER YOU MIGHT SAY OH REALLY AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE ALIVE JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER ANIMAL WHAT WOULD YOU SUPPOSE WOULD HAPPEN IF ALL SHARKS WOULD DISAPPEAR FROM THE OCEANS SORRY I CAN'T TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY IF YOU THINK ONLY CUDDLY CRITTERS NEED TO BE SPARED
AS A VEGETARIAN CHILD GROWING UP IN A SCHOOL OF KIDS THIS TOPIC CAME UP ALMOST DAILY AT LUNCHTIME BETWEEN THE AGE OF OTHER KIDS WOULD ASK WHY I HAD A PILE OF GRATED CHEESE ON MY PLATE INSTEAD OF MEAT I HATED THAT QUESTION THE OTHER KIDS FELT VERY CHALLENGED BY THE IDEA THAT IT WASN'T NECESSARY TO EAT MEAT SOMETIMES MY MEAT EATING FRIENDS WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR ME AND DEFEND VEGETARIANISM AS THEY ATE THEIR MEAT ONE KID ONCE ASKED HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE

I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION SO MANY TIMES AND I THINK THAT THE OBVIOUS ANSWER IS THAT IT CAN'T BE ARGUED THAT IT IS MORALLY CORRECT SO THE QUESTION I ASK MYSELF IS WHY DO PEOPLE THINK THAT IT IS MORALLY CORRECT WHEN IT ISN'T

WE ARE A TRIBAL ANIMAL AND WHEN OUR TRIBE DOES SOMETHING COLLECTIVELY WE HAVE A STRONG URGE TO COPY THINK OF THAT PSYCHOLOGY EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU PUT PEOPLE INTO A ROOM AND WHEN SMOKE POURS IN AND DON'T MOVE THEN THE 10TH WILL STAY PUT

ACTING COLLECTIVELY IS A MASSIVELY ADVANTAGEOUS ATTRIBUTE FOR SURVIVAL IN ONE SENSE WE CAN ACHIEVE SO MUCH MORE TOGETHER IRONICALLY HOWEVER WITH GLOBAL WARMING THREATENING TO MAKE MANKIND EXTINCT IT IS THIS SAME ATTRIBUTE THAT IS TO BLAME

YES WE ARE OMNIVORES WE ARE DESIGNED TO CONSUME ANIMALS SO YES IT'S OK YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WE ALL HAVE CANINE TEETH AND INCISORS AND WE HAVE NO TROUBLE METABOLIZING ANIMAL PROTEIN
ANIMALS HAVE A CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM BRAIN AND HEART THEIR BODIES WORK VERY SIMILAR TO HUMANS AND TRY TO MAINTAIN HOMEOSTASIS THEY CAN FEEL PAIN AND FEEL FEAR THEY CAN DEVELOP MEMORIES BASED OFF OF NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES THAT MANIFEST ITSELF THROUGH AVOIDING THAT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE AGAIN

HUMANS DON'T NEED TO EAT MEAT THE PROTEIN WE NEED CAN BE FOUND FROM OTHER SOURCES SOY BEANS MANY PRODUCTS ARE NOW OUT THAT IMITATE THE TASTES AND TEXTURES OF REAL MEAT THERE IS ALSO IN PROGRESS THE GROWING OF MEAT IN LABS IN WHICH NO ANIMALS WERE FARMED THERE ARE SOLUTIONS TO FACTORY FARMING AND WE SHOULD BE MOVING TOWARDS THOSE SOLUTIONS AND QUIT THIS ARCHAIC WAY OF LIVING

WHAT A STUPID QUESTION WE ARE OMNIVORES AND WE ARE GENETICALLY PREDISPOSED TO HUNT AND KILL ANIMALS WE'VE BEEN DOING SINCE THE BEGINNING WHY BECAUSE WE ADVANCE AS A SPECIES AND DEVELOP A SYSTEM OF SELF PRESERVATION IS IT QUESTIONED AS AN IMMORAL ACT FUCKING HUMANS
BASED ON THIS ARGUMENT COULD WE ALSO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IS NOT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE FOR A WOLF TO EAT A PIG OR FOR A LION TO EAT A GAZELLE OR POTENTIALLY EVEN FOR A SPIDER TO EAT A FLY

AND IF SO ARE WE ALSO MORALLY OBLIGATED TO ENFORCE THIS MORAL STANDARD UPON OTHER CREATURES THE SAME WAY WE WOULD ENFORCE IT ON A CANNIBAL HUMAN

PERHAPS THE DIFFERENCE WE ARE LOOKING FOR BETWEEN THE PIG AND THE HUMAN IS THE CONCEPT OF MORALITY ITSELF THIS ANSWER AND EVEN THE QUESTION OF IS IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD BRINGS UP AN EVEN BIGGER QUESTION WHAT IS MORALITY THAT'S A PRETTY BIG QUESTION THAT I DON'T BELIEVE HAS AN EASY ANSWER SO INSTEAD I WILL TELL YOU WHAT MORALITY IS NOT

MORALITY IS NOT A STRICT SET OF RULES THAT GOVERNS THE WORLD OR EVEN OUR OWN SPECIES THERE ARE SOCIETAL NORMS AND AN ACCEPTED MORALITY WHICH MOSTLY CREATES OUR LAWS BUT THIS LAWFUL MORALITY ALSO ONCE SAID THAT GAYS SHOULDN'T MARRY AND THAT ENSLAVING OTHER HUMANS IS TOTALLY FINE

EVERY GENERATION AND EVERY SOCIETY AND EVEN EVERY PERSON HAS A DIFFERENT CONCEPT OF WHAT IS AND IS NOT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE SOME HUMAN CULTURES DO BELIEVE THAT KILLING OTHER HUMANS FOR WHATEVER REASON IS NOT ONLY PERMISSIBLE BUT REQUIRED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS

MORALITY IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE BUT THE CORE GOAL OF MORALITY IS TO CREATE A SET OF RULES THAT PEOPLE ABIDE BY TO BE ABLE TO CREATE AND LIVE TOGETHER IN A FUNCTIONAL SOCIETY WHOSE IS TO BETTER ITSELF

SO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION IS IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD FOR ME YES MY PERSONAL MORALS DICTATE THAT IT IS NOT WRONG FOR ME TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD AND THE SOCIETY THAT I LIVE IN DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT MY CHOICE IS WRONG IF THE QUESTION IS POSED TO YOU AND YOUR ANSWER IS NO THEN SO BE IT YOU HAVE DECIDED THAT IT IS NOT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE FOR YOU TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD AND SOCIETY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT YOUR CHOICE TO ABSTAIN FROM IT IS WRONG

THERE MAY COME A TIME IN THE FUTURE WHERE SOCIETAL MORALITY SHIFTS AND DECIDES IT IS NO LONGER PERMISSIBLE TO KILL AND EAT ANIMALS BUT THAT TIME IS NOT NOW
REMOVED
I WOULD AGREE WITH THIS VIDEO AS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT A CHRISTIAN BUT AS I AM A CHRISTIAN I BELIEVE IT IS OK FOR HUMANS TO EAT ANIMALS


GENESIS SAYS AND GOD SAID BEHOLD I HAVE GIVEN YOU EVERY HERB BEARING SEED WHICH IS UPON THE FACE OF ALL THE EARTH AND EVERY TREE IN THE WHICH IS THE FRUIT OF A TREE YIELDING SEED TO YOU IT SHALL BE FOR MEAT AND TO EVERY BEAST OF THE EARTH AND TO EVERY FOWL OF THE AIR AND TO EVERY THING THAT CREEPETH UPON THE EARTH WHEREIN THERE IS LIFE I HAVE GIVEN EVERY GREEN HERB FOR MEAT AND IT WAS SO


GOD CREATED ANIMALS AND PLANTS SO THAT THEY COULD BE EATEN BY HUMANS THAT IS THE PURPOSE BY WHICH THEY WERE CREATED
IF THE ANIMAL WAS RAISED WELL THEN I HAVE NO ISSUE EATING IT IN FACT WITHOUT THE DEMAND FOR MEAT THE POPULATION OF DOMESTICATED ANIMALS WOULD PLUMET

LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE IF EVERYBODY DECIDED NOT TO EAT BEEF TODAY THEN ALL THE FARMERS WHO RAISE COWS FOR BEEF NOT DAIRY FARMERS WOULD HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO KEEP THEIR COWS ANYMORE AND THEY WOULD AETHER KILL THEIR COWS OR RELEASE THEM IF THEY RELEASE THE COWS THIS COULD BE A HUGE PROBLEM IN MANY WAYS FIRST WOULD BE COWS WONDERING ACROSS ROADS CAUSING ACCIDENTS ANOTHER WOULD BE BECAUSE COWS HAVE BEEN DOMESTICATED SO LONG THAT THEY DONT HAVE THE SAME ABILITY TO SURVIVE UNPROTECTED IN THE WILD THIS MEANS LARGE PREDATORS WILL HAVE A FEAST FOR EXAMPLE WOLF POPULATIONS WOULD SKYROCKET WHICH WOULD BE A HORRID ISSUE AND THE WHOLE BALANCE OF WHATEVER ECOSYSTEM WOULD BE THROWN OUT OF WHACK
RESULTING IN THE POPULATION OF THE BOVINE SPECIES TO PLUMET

SO IN CONCLUSION BY EATING MEET I AM IN EFFECT CREATING A DEMAND THAT ALLOWS THE SUPPLY TO CONTINUE TO BE LOOKED AFTER IN EFFECT GIVING THE ANIMALS A CHANCE TO LIVE
DELETED
I READ THE QUESTION POSED AS
IS IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL FOR FOOD WHEN FOOD OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE

FROM AN ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS YES KILLING IS A NECESSARY PART OF A HEALTHY BALANCED AND BIOLOGICALLY DIVERSE ECOSYSTEM AND HUMANS ARE A NATURAL PREDATOR IN THE ECOSYSTEM WHEN THE UNITED STATES KILLED OFF ALL OF ITS WOLVES IN GENERAL A HUGE NUMBER OF ITS PREDATORS IN THE WEST PREY POPULATIONS SKYROCKETED AND ECOSYSTEMS CHANGED FOR THE WORSE

WHEN WE LOOK AT FACTORY FARMING AND THE NUMBER OF ANIMAL DEATHS RELATED TO THAT I FEEL THE MORALITY OF KILLING FOR FOOD BECOMES MOOT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE CREATED AN OBLIGATION TO KILL ALL THESE ANIMALS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASING THEM TO THE WILD WOULD WREAK HAVOC ON NATURE AREAS OF THE AMERICAN WEST ARE STILL SUFFERING THE SCARS FROM OVERGRAZING DECADES AFTER GRAZING THOSE AREAS HAS STOPPED AND THE NUMBER OF CATTLE THEN DID NOT APPROACH WHAT WE HAVE TODAY

THIS RAISES AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT QUESTION WHICH I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO ADDRESS RIGHT NOW AND THAT IS WHETHER IT IS MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO BREED ANY ANIMAL FOR THE EVENTUAL PURPOSE OF KILLING IT


I BELIEVE IT COMES DOWN TO A LACK OF PROVEN SENTIENCE IN THE ANIMALS

FOR EXAMPLE IT IS CONSIDERED THAT HUMANS ARE THE ONLY CREATURES WHO CAN CURRENTLY BE PROVEN TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PERCEIVE THEIR OWN EXISTENCE AND ASK WHY

SOME OTHER ANIMALS SHOW TRAITS THAT MAKE US FEEL THEY ARE THAT MUCH CLOSER TO US IN THAT REGARD SUCH AS THE GREAT APES DOLPHINS AND OTHER ANIMALS THAT YOU MOST LIKELY WON'T FIND AT YOUR DELI COUNTER

THE FURTHER WE AS HUMANS CAN PUT OURSELVES OUTSIDE OF THE MIND OF HOW WE THINK AN ANIMAL WOULD FEEL IF THEY CAN FEEL AT ALL MAKES IT THAT MUCH EASIER FOR US TO KILL THEM AS FOOD

ONE OF THE EXAMPLES GIVEN IN THE VIDEO IS IF ALIENS CAME DOWN AND STARTED FARMING US IF THIS WAS THE CASE WE AS HUMANS WOULD NOT SIMPLY ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE CORRALLED AND FARMED UNLESS WE WERE FORCED TO BY THE ALIENS SUPERIORITY WE WOULD FIGHT OR TRY TO COMMUNICATE AND REASON WITH THE ALIENS PIGS ON THE OTHER HAND DON'T ASK WHERE THEIR BUDDIES ARE GOING WHEN THEY FARMER HEADS OFF TO SLAUGHTER THEY SIMPLY LINE UP FOR THE NEXT TRAY OF FOOD

TO FOLLOW THAT EXAMPLE IT IS SAID THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE IS NOT REASON ENOUGH TO EAT THE PIG BECAUSE SOME OF US HAVE LESS THAN THE MENTAL CAPACITY OF A PIG BUT NOT ALL OF US DO AND THIS IS THE KEY POINT THE MAJORITY OF US ARE FAR AND ABOVE SMARTER THAN PIGS BUT LETS SAY EVEN A FEW PIGS COULD MATCH OUR HUMAN BRAINS TIT FOR TAT AND STAND UP AND SAY WAIT STOP KILLING US WE ARE NOT JUST DUMB ANIMALS WE WOULD MOST LIKELY STOP FARMING THEM BUT THEY CAN'T STAND UP AND SAY THAT BECAUSE PIGS WHILE VERY INTELLIGENT CREATURES ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THE FUTURE OF PIG KIND THEY ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THEIR IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND POSSIBLY THAT OF THEIR OFFSPRING

IN CONCLUSION I WOULD SAY I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH THE ORIGINAL POSTS CLAIM THAT WE SHOULD NOT EAT PIGS BECAUSE SOME OF THEM ARE SMARTER IN SOME WAY THAN OUR MENTALLY HANDICAPPED BRETHREN I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE WAY ANIMALS ARE TREATED IN LARGE FARMING AND BUTCHERING OPERATIONS AND THINK THAT ANIMALS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH HIGHER STANDARDS EVEN IF THEY ARE DESTINED FOR OUR CONSUMPTION BUT BACON IS DELICIOUS AND UNTIL A PIG AND A SPIDER GET TOGETHER IN REALITY TO CONVINCE ME OF A HIGHER INTELLIGENCE I AM GOING TO ENJOY SOME PIG

HISTORY AND ALIEN CULTURES WILL NOT JUDGE US AT THE CURRENT TIME FOR US EATING ANIMALS THE REASON I KNOW FOR CERTAIN IS BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES THE MOST POWERFUL RICH COUNTRY ON THE PLANET JUST ELECTED DONALD TRUMP WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE ETHICS OF ANYTHING FOR AT LEAST YEARS
LIFE EATS LIFE PLAIN AND SIMPLE
IT DEPENDS IF YOU VALUE AESTHETIC VALUES ENJOYING MEAT OVER TAKING THE LIFE OF A SENTIENT ANIMAL I PERSONALLY STILL LIKE MEAT TOO MUCH TO GIVE IT UP THANKFULLY IT COMES PREPACKAGED IN SHRINK WRAP SO I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH
THE ANSWER LIES OUTSIDE OF THE MORALS

WE LIVE IN A BUBBLE OF MATTER THAT IS SUSTAINABLE TO LIFE
US BEING LIFE WE MUST CONSUME ORGANIC MATTER
THE THE EASIEST AND MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO HARVEST NUTRIENTS IS TO COLLECT IT FROM OTHER LIVING THINGS WITHIN OUR LITTLE LIFE SUPPORTING BUBBLE BECAUSE OUR SPECIES IS SO MASSIVE AND ADVANCED IN OUR METHODS OF MAKING NUTRIENTS READY TO EAT


THIS VIDEO IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW USING STRAW MEN MAKES YOU FEEL SUPERIOR IN YOUR ARGUMENT WITHOUT PROVING ANYTHING
IS IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE FOR A LION TO KILL A ZEBRA FOR FOOD

OF COURSE IT IS THEY'RE ANIMALS AND THEY EVOLVED TO KILL OTHER ANIMALS FOR FOOD

BUT WE'RE ALSO ANIMALS AND KILLED ANIMALS FOR FOOD OVER ALL OF OUR EVOLUTION AND HAVE A PHYSIOLOGY DESIGNED TO DIGEST ANIMALS WE CANNOT LIVE BY KALE ALONE

WHY SHOULD OUR KIND OF ANIMAL BE MORE CONSTRAINED TO DEPART FROM ITS NATURE THAN ANY OTHER KIND OF ANIMAL

BECAUSE WE HAVE UNDERSTANDING AND THEY DON'T YOU ANSWER

AHA AND THERE'S THE ANSWER TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION AS WELL

PIGS HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF MORTALITY THEY SURELY UNDERSTAND PAIN AND SUFFERING BUT NOT DEATH

IF WE CAN KILL THEM IN SUCH A WAY AS TO AVOID SUFFERING WE'VE DONE THEM NO HARM

I WOULDN'T WANT TO KILL AN ELEPHANT SINCE THEY APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND DEATH MOURN THEIR DEAD ETC

IF WE DIDN'T EAT PIGS THERE WOULD BE MANY FEWER OF THEM IN THE WORLD OVER OF THE WEIGHT OF THE MAMMALIAN BIOME CONSISTS OF DOMESTICATED ANIMALS MAINLY RAISED FOR FOOD

IF WE DIDN'T EAT THEM THE VAST MAJORITY OF PIGS COWS CHICKENS ETC WOULDN'T EXIST AT ALL WE GIVE THEM LIFE PROTECT THEM FROM DISEASE AND PREDATORS THAT WOULD KILL THEM MUCH MORE PAINFULLY THAN WE DO OR SHOULD DO

WOULD MORALITY REQUIRE THAT WE RAISE THEM ALL AT CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE BUT KEEP THEM AS PETS AND NOT EAT THEM

MORALLY I'M ABLE TO BE THE BEST TO OTHERS IF I'M HEALTHY RATHER THAN DRAGGING SOCIETY DOWN I CAN CONTRIBUTE SO ON ONE HAND I COULD STOP EATING ANIMALS I KNOW SOMEONE'S GOING TO SAY I'M WRONG SO SAY IT THIS WAY I PERSONALLY HAVE NEVER SEEN A HEALTHY VEGETARIAN I HAVE SEEN THEM IN HOSPITALS I'VE SEEN THEM TOO THIN AND THE LACK OF PROTEIN IS USUALLY PRETTY BAD BECAUSE YOU CANNOT EAT ENOUGH LEGUMES TO EQUAL RED MEAT HAVING BEEN RAISED WITH MEAT APPROXIMATELY ONCE A WEEK CHICKEN USUALLY I'M AWARE OF THE BENEFITS OF NOT EATING A LOT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THAT BEING SAID I'M SURE SOMEONE OUT THERE IS A VERY HEALTHY INTERESTING SMELLING PERSON WHO DOESN'T EAT ANIMALS HE DIDN'T SAY MEAT BUT I'M A VEGETARIAN AND I EAT FISH GO WATCH THE VIDEO AND TELL ME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FISH AND A PIG
BUT I CAN EAT EGGS AND STUFF YES BECAUSE IT'S OKAY TO ENSLAVE AND TAKE EGGS FROM ANIMALS AWARE THEY'RE NOT FERTILIZED BUT YOU JUST CAN'T KILL THAT PARTICULAR ANIMAL THAT BRINGS ABOUT THE MORAL QUESTION OF SLAVERY AND POSSESSION AND THE LEVEL OF EQUALITY IS HAS TO KILLING

AND MY FAVORITE WHY DO WE CARE MORE ABOUT ANIMALS THAN PLANTS THEY HAVE FEELINGS THEY HAVE NERVES THEY CRY ETC BECAUSE IN THE END BIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL TO LIVE TO PASS ON YOUNG IN THAT REGARD THERE IS NO MORAL DIFFERENCE YOU ARE KILLING TO EAT EITHER WAY BUT SINCE WE CAN PHYSICALLY SEE THE DISTRESS OF AN ANIMAL WE RELATE

I FIND THE LOGIC FLAWED BUT I ALSO DON'T EAT MUCH ANIMALS STRICTLY BESIDE I WAS GETTING A GUT NOT BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY A MORAL PERSON
IT IS A FOOD CHAIN AND WE ARE AT THE TOP OF THAT FOOD CHAIN SO THERE SHOULDN'T BE ETHICS ON IF IT'S OKAY TO EAT AN ANIMAL OBVIOUSLY NOT LIKE DOGS OR CATS BUT THE MAIN ANIMALS THAT GENERATIONS OVER GENERATIONS HAVE ALWAYS KILLED FOR FOOD

MY OPINION ON MORALS
LEVEL INSTINCT
PEOPLE DO WHAT IS IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS WHEN IT COMES TO SURVIVAL EVERY WO MAN FOR THEMSELVES

LEVEL 2 MORALS
PEOPLES MORALS ARE AN INDIVIDUALS ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IMMEDIATELY SATISFYING DECISIONS MAY BE PUT OFF IN FAVOR OF GREATER LONGTERM GOALS EX I AM HUNGRY BUT I WILL NOT KILL MY FELLOW HUMAN BECAUSE I CAN SURVIVE BY EATING THIS APPLE AND THEN I MAY HAVE COMPANIONSHIP LATER MORALS ARE KINDA LIKE COMMON SENSE AND THEY DO VARY AMONGST A POPULOUS

LEVEL STRUCTURE PACKS
DIFFERENT PEOPLE DEVELOP DIFFERENT MORALS BUT OFTEN A COMMON TRAIT IS A GOAL OF BONDING WITH THE SAME SPECIES THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO CORE NEEDS SUCH AS REPRODUCTION SAFETY COMPANIONSHIP ETC THIS BRINGS PACKS OF PEOPLE TOGETHER WHO SHARE THE SAME MORALS

LEVEL STRUCTURE GOVERNMENT
NOW THAT WE HAVE PACKS OF LIKE MINDED PEOPLE WE GO THROUGH A SIMILAR CYCLE PACKS HAVE THEIR BEST INTEREST IN MIND AND WILL KILL OTHER PACKS IF IT BENEFITS THEM THE PROBLEM IS THAT MENTALITY IS RECIPROCAL AS THE SOCIETY GROWS BOTH PACKS LEARN THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE BY JUST KILL LESS EVOLVED SPECIES AT MUCH LESS COST THAN KILLING EACH OTHER THE PACKS BOND AND SETUP A GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT RULES BASED ON THE MAJORITY OF THE MORALS EVERYONE AGREES ON GROUPS WITH MOST MORALS IN LINE WITH THE GOVERNMENT SUPPRESS THEIR MINORITY MORALS OR EXERCISE THEM IN PRIVATE AMONGST THOSE WHO ARE LIKE-MINDED THOSE FAR ENOUGH FROM SOCIETIES MORAL COMPASS ARE REMOVED FROM THE STRUCTURE

CONCLUSION
PIGS ARE STUCK SOMEWHERE BETWEEN LEVEL AND 2 IF OUR BEST INTEREST IS BACON PIGS BETTER WORK ON CLIMBING THE EVOLUTIONARY LADDER TO LEVEL AND COMPLETE A PETITION BTW IF ALIENS DO COME TO OUR PLANET AND WE IN FACT TASTE LIKE BACON TO THEM YOU BETTER BELIEVE WE WILL BE TREATED AS BACON AND THE ALIENS WILL HAVE NO MORAL DILEMMAS ABOUT IT

GIVEN MORALITY IS A CONSTRUCT OF PEOPLE'S COMMONLY HELD BELIEFS OR DETERMINATIONS OF WHAT IS AND ISN'T ACCEPTABLE IN SOCIETY THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL MORAL SENSE SO OUR SENSE OF MORALS IS DETERMINED BY THE COLLECTIVE PRACTICES OF THIS SURROUNDING US IT IS SIMPLY PEOPLE THEMSELVES THAT DETERMINE IF IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO KILL THE PIG FOR FOOD WHEN THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE THUS MAKING IT A MORAL CHOICE

IF OUR SOCIETY DECIDED THAT MORALITY WAS BASED UPON A DIFFERENT SET OF PRINCIPLES NAMELY MAKING SURE THAT WE ALWAY US THE LESS SENTIENT SOURCE OF FOOD AND IT WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO DO OTHERWISE WE WOULD CONSIDER KILLING THE PIG IMMORAL

LIKEWISE IF WE LIVED IN A SOCIETY WERE THERE WAS A CULTURALLY ACCEPTABLE PRACTICE OF EATING THE LEASE USEFUL MEMBERS OF OUR TRIBE WE WOULD CONSIDER PRACTICES MORAL

WE HAVE SEEN SHIFT IN MORAL BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF MORALITY WITH ISSUES SUCH AS HUMAN SACRIFICES SLAVERY WAR CONQUEST FOR PROFIT AT SOME POINT THESE THINGS WERE MORALLY ACCEPTABLE BUT AS SOCIETIES APPETITE FOR SUCH ITEMS DECLINED IT WAS CONSIDERED MORALLY IRREPRESSIBLE

SO IN CONCLUSION IT IS MORALLY ACCEPTABLE TO KILL THE PIG BECAUSE SOCIETY AS A WHOLE AGREES IT IS ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR
HUMANITY'S FREEWILL TO DO LITERALLY WHATEVER WE PLEASE WITH OUR BODIES SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY NOT EATING ANOTHER HUMAN THE AMOUNT OF STUFF FROM FOOD DRUGS AND MEDICATIONS ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER SOMEONE WISHES TO INGEST IS COMPLETELY UP TO THEM AND THOSE ODDS ARE NOT WORTH IT LOL
WHAT YOU KEEP STATING IS THAT THERE IS NOT LOGICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HUMAN AND A PIG THAT COULD NOT ALSO BE USED BY AN ALIEN ON US I SAY THIS IS FALSE HUMANS ARE THE ONLY CREATURES THAT WE HAVE ANY EVIDENCE FOR SENTIENCE AS WELL AS SUBJECTIVITY THE ONLY WAY WE CAN PROVIDE THIS EVIDENCE IS TO OURSELVES TRUE THE ALIENS CAN USE THIS ARGUMENT AS WELL BUT IF IT TURNS OUT WE AREN'T SENTIENT THEN SURE I COULD CARE LESS IF THEY EAT US UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE WE KNOW WE ARE SENTIENT WE DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT PIGS ARE
REMOVED
WHEN IS IT MORALLY DEFENSIBLE TO JUDGE OTHERS CHOICES IS IT ENOUGH IF A THIRD PARTY JUST FEELS SYMPATHY FOR THE PIG OR KALE OR BROTHER OR DO THEY NEED SOME SKIN IN THE GAME SO TO SPEAK

THIS IS AN AWFUL GAMBIT I SHOULDN'T PLAY BECAUSE I'M PERSONALLY TOO RELATIVIST TO HOLD ANY ANSWER IN MY GOBLET FOR VERY LONG
I POSIT THIS THEN

WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN ANIMAL AND PLANT

AS FAR AS I CAN TELL ALL THE CRITERIA USED TO DEFINE LIVING BEINGS INCLUDE PLANTS
THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IS A BIT QUEAZY TO ME WHEN YOU LOOK INTO IT BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE IDEA OF EATING ANIMALS I JUST DON'T THINK THE MASS FARMING AND THE MANNER WE MASS FARM THEM ARE IDEAL
I ALWAYS THINK OF IT LIKE THIS I IMAGINE MYSELF IN A PERFECT STATE SITTING IN A STATE OF LOVING AND PEACEFUL FEELINGS THAT STATE I'D LIKE TO BE IN ALL THE TIME THEN I SEE A TOMATO PLANT IN FRONT OF ME AND A CUTE LITTLE RABBIT NOW I REACH OVER AND PICK A TOMATO FROM THE PLANT MAINTAINING MY GOOD FEELINGS IS EASY IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING THEN I TAKE I KNIFE AND GRAB THE LITTLE BUNNY BY THE BACK OF THE HEAD AND SLIT IT'S THROAT MUCH HARDER TO MAINTAIN MY GOOD FEELINGS AND IT'S NOT A NICE EXPERIENCE IN MY MIND THIS IS ENOUGH TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ACT OF KILLING ANOTHER BEING IS NOT IN LINE WITH THE STATE I'D LIKE TO CREATE IN MYSELF AND IN THE WORLD ALSO IT'S CLEAR THAT PICKING A TOMATO AND KILLING A LIVING ANIMAL ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT ACTS
IN A WORLD WHERE ALIENS COME TO VISIT US WHY IS OUR BIGGEST CONCERN THE MORALITY OF EATING PIGS
THIS VIDEO MISSES THE POINT ENTIRELY PIGS ARE A SAFE FOOD SOURCE FOR HUMANS HUMANS ARE NOT A SAFE FOOD SOURCE FOR OTHER HUMANS THEREFORE DON'T KILL AND EAT PEOPLE AND YOUR SURVIVABILITY INCREASES
BY THIS LOGIC IT'S ALSO WRONG TO KILL KALE FOR FOOD
THE BIG THING HE MISSES IS THAT THE PIG DOESN'T EVER SAY WHY ARE YOU EATING ME
AMAZING VIDEO I HOPE PEOPLE CAN WATCH IT WITH AN OPEN MIND
IT'S OKAY TO DO IT TRUST ME
CONSIDER THIS

EVERYTHING EVENTUALLY DIES WE CAN'T AND SHOULDN'T PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING IT IS THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAS AND ALWAYS SHOULD BE
ONCE A SOUL IF YOU WILL LEAVES THE BODY THE BODY BECOMES A EMPTY HUSK FULL OF RESOURCES THAT BENEFIT THOSE AROUND IT IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER TO LET THAT GO TO WASTE IS A HORRIBLE SHAME EVEN TODAY IN THIS ERA OF ABUNDANCE WE USE AS MUCH OF AN ANIMAL AS WE CAN SO THAT NOTHING GOES TO WASTE I PERSONALLY THINK THAT CHOOSING TO REJECT THE NATURE OF HOW THINGS WORK SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'RE CONVINCED THAT LITTLE OLD YOU ABSTAINING FROM EATING MEAT WILL DO ANYTHING TO STOP THIS SOMEHOW WRONG PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN THE VERY BASE OF OUR CIVILISATION FROM CONTINUING TO EXIST IS SIMPLY ABSURD AND STUPID
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE WHO SEEM DESPERATE TO PROVE THAT IT'S MORALLY OK TO KILL A PIG JUST SAY YOU'RE GOING TO EAT THE PIG NO MATTER WHAT AND BE DONE WITH IT IF YOU'RE SO COOL WITH IT THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE TRIES TO TELL YOU IT'S MORALLY WRONG
REMOVED
SO YOU WANT THE ENTIRE THE WORLD TO TURN VEGETARIAN
I CAN'T EVEN WATCH THESE VIDEOS I JUST GOT BACK FROM THANKSGIVING IN RURAL MINNESOTA THE TURKEY WAS RAISED SLAUGHTERED AND PREPARED AT MY AUNT AND UNCLES HOUSE SAME WITH THE PIG WE ATE AND THE CORN AND ALL THE VEGETABLES THAT VENISON JERKY MY UNCLE SHOT THAT LAST WEEK ALL DELICIOUS ANIMALS TASTE GREAT

ONLY IN AMERICA THIS IS AN ETHICS ISSUE IF YOU WERE IN NORTH KOREA KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD WOULD NEVER BE AN ISSUE
I THINK IT'S A NONSENSICAL QUESTION MORALITY CAN'T BE APPLIED TO THIS AS WE LIVE IN A SYSTEM IN WHICH EVERYTHING WITH OUR BIOLOGY KILLS AND EATS SOME OTHER LIVING THING WE CAN NOT HAVE LIFE WITHOUT TAKING LIFE WE CAN NOT EXIST WITHOUT KILLING AND EATING SOME OTHER LIVING THING EVEN IF WE ARE NOT DIRECTLY KILLING THE FOOD WE DO SO BY PROXY AS THE INDUSTRIAL MACHINE BE IT FARMING ANIMAL FARMING SUPPLEMENT CREATION ETC DOES ALL THE KILLING AND NUTRIENT EXTRACTION FOR US AT IT'S CORE THE QUESTION ASKS IS IT MORALLY RIGHT TO EXIST
BUT THE PIG MIGHT SAY
EXCEPT NO PIG CAN SAY BOTH BECAUSE THE PIG CAN'T SPEAK AND MORE IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE THE PIG CAN'T REASON THE ABILITY TO THINK UNDERSTAND AND FORM JUDGMENTS BY A PROCESS OF LOGIC IS THE KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THE ANIMALS WE KILL FOR FOOD
THE ABILITY OF THE SPECIES TO REASON MAKES THE SPECIES IMMORAL TO EAT HIS SEVERELY RETARDED BROTHER EVEN IF HE LACKED THE ABILITY TO REASON IS STILL A MEMBER OF A SPECIES WHICH CAN REASON SO KILLING HIS BROTHER IS DIFFERENT THAN KILLING A PIG LIKEWISE WE AS A SPECIES CLEARLY REASON SO IT IS IMMORAL FOR THE ALIEN TO KILL US FOR FOOD BUT NOT FOR US TO KILL PIGS FOR FOOD


CONFUSING LOGIC REMEMBER EVERYONE YOU ARE ALL ANIMALS
I MEAN IT BEATS THE ALTERNATIVE TO STARVING TO DEATH
YES CONSIDERING WE HAVE EVOLVED WITH CANINE TEETH NATURALLY CLASSIFYING US AS CARNIVORES IF THE ONLY ARGUMENT IS THAT WE WERE CREATED AND DIDN'T EVOLVE THEN YOU'RE AN IDIOT FOR BELIEVING IN FAIRY TALES AND NOT CONSIDERING THAT IF THERE WERE A GOD HE CREATED US WITH CANINE TEETH MAKING US CARNIVORES
FIRST I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I LOVE THEORETICAL SCIENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ETHICS I ALSO LIKE PINNING ETHICS AGAINST NATURE OR THE LAWS OF IT BECAUSE IT GIVES US A SENSE OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME AS KNOWLEDGABLE PEOPLE

SO WITH THAT SAID I'M GONNA HAVE TO RULE WITH NATURE ON THIS ONE I THINK IT IS MORALLY ACCEPTABLE TO KILL ANY ANIMAL AND HONESTLY EVEN A HUMAN FOR SURVIVAL NOW FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN WE LIKE HOW IT TASTES WELL THAT'S FOR US AS HUMANS TO DECIDE AND WE CAN'T BASE IT ON NATURAL CAUSES NO OTHER ANIMAL HAS THE DESIRE TO KILL AN ANIMAL IT WON'T EAT SO WE CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO COMPARE IT

WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WHILE HUNTING AND FORAGING ARE MEANS FOR SURVIVAL THEY ARE ALSO MEANS TO HELP LIMIT POPULATION GROWTH ANIMALS ONLY GOALS ARE TO LIVE AND BREED THEY DON'T ASPIRE TO BE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS OR FIX PROBLEMS WITH THE COUNTRY THEY LIVE IN IF NECESSARY YES THE PIG WOULD ATTEMPT TO KILL AND EAT YOU

ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS THE REASONS WE DON'T KILL AND EAT HUMANS ARE SOMEWHAT VARIED ONE IS THAT IT'S UNETHICAL TO FARM HUMANS AS IT WOULD BE WEIRD FOR A PIG TO FARM OTHER PIGS NOT JUST THAT IT'S CANNIBALISM BUT IMAGINE ONE DAY YOU GOT BENT OVER AND TOLD THAT YOU'RE A FARM ANIMAL NOW WOULDN'T THAT BE ODD ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT WE CARRY RESPECT FOR OUR DEAD AND WE CAN'T REALLY RESPECT OUR DEAD IF WE EAT THEM

HUMANS HAVE A LOT OF HUMILITY AND I ALWAYS FIND IT FUNNY WHENEVER WE START TALKING ABOUT THE ETHICAL MORALS OF AFFECTING ANOTHER LIVING LIFE OR WE COULD JUST IGNORE IT WHENEVER WE HUMANS TRY TO INTERFERE IN ANOTHER LIFE IT DOESN'T GO DOWN VERY WELL WE EITHER MAKE IT WORSE OR PLACE THEM IN A POSITION THAT WAS SO VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THEIR LAST IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE PUT THEM IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PREDICAMENT

TL R PIGS HAVE LIVED THEIR LIVES FOR A LONG TIME WITH US KILLING AND FARMING THEM AND EXISTING IN THE WILD THEY HAVEN'T GONE EXTINCT YET AND THEY CERTAINLY AREN'T GOING TO ANYTIME SOON
DOES THE LION FEEL BAD FOR EATING ANTELOPE

WE ARE AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN IT IS OKAY TO EAT ANIMALS JUST BECAUSE WE CAN

I THINK IF ANY ANIMAL GOT HIGHER IN THEIR LOCAL FOOD CHAIN MOST SPECIES WOULDN'T HESITATE TO CONSUME MORE OR BE SYMPATHETIC TO OTHER ANIMALS
LIFE AND DEATH GO HAND IN HAND IF WE DIDN'T EAT MEAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE IN THE FIRST PLACE

FOR ME ITS A NON ISSUE ITS A PART OF LIFE AND IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE I SEE IT SIMPLY AS A ISSUE OF MATURITY AND INTELLIGENCE MILLIONS OF ANIMALS KILL OTHER ANIMALS ON THIS PLANET EVERYDAY FOR FOOD WE ARE JUST PART OF THIS SYSTEM ACCEPT IT PLEASE SO WE CAN MOVE ON TO MORE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS

IF YOU CANT YOU BETTER PACK YOUR CAMPING GEAR AND HEAD BUSH BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AS I'M TYPING THIS THERE'S PROBABLY A MILLION ANIMALS DYING FROM INJURIES DISEASE OR ABOUT TO BE EATEN BY ANOTHER ANIMAL QUICK BETTER SAVE THEM SO YOU CAN FEEL GOOD

THINK ABOUT THIS WE REVERE THE BIG CATS OF THIS WORLD THE LIONS AND TIGERS MAGNIFICENT ANIMALS THEY ARE NOT TO BE HUNTED OR KILLED FOR SPORT OR EVEN FOOD EVERY DAY THEY MAIM AND KILL OTHER ANIMALS IN THE MOST HORRIBLE WAYS THEY EVEN START EATING SOME OF THEIR PRAY WHILST IT'S STILL ALIVE SHOULDN'T WE WIPE THEM OUT OH NO NO NO IT'S PART OF NATURE ITS SURVIVAL IT'S NATURE
WELL WE ARE ANIMALS TOO WE ARE PART OF NATURE WE NEED TO SURVIVE TO AND YES WE NEED ANIMAL PRODUCTS TO DO THAT

MANAGE IT CORRECTLY TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY BUT GET OVER IT WE NEED TO DO IT
I'VE SEEN THIS POP UP SO MANY TIMES I FIND IT AS ANNOYING AS HELL QUITE SIMPLY I KNOW HIS ARGUMENT IS GARBAGE BUT I DON'T HAVE THE PHILOSOPHY BACKGROUND TO PUT MY FINGER ON EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG BUT HERE I GO ANYWAY

THE FIRST FALLACY IS ON OF TO MANY QUESTIONS TYLER DOGGET STARTS OFF BY NARROWING THE ISSUE TO THE POINT THAT THE MORALITY OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF KILLING ANIMALS FOR FOOD ISN'T UP FOR DEBATE HOW CONVENIENT BECAUSE ONCE THAT IS DONE HIS ARGUMENT FAILS REPEATEDLY

ALLOW ME TO BRING IN THE MORALITY OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF KILLING FOR FOOD IS IT MORALLY ACCEPTABLE TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD GIVEN THAT OUR BODIES BIOLOGICALLY REQUIRE ANIMAL PRODUCTS OR ARE WE MORALLY OBLIGATED TO EAT MANUFACTURED FOOD TO AVOID KILLING ANIMALS

I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH A FEW OF HIS ARGUMENTS WITH THE EXPANDED QUESTION AND IN THIS INSTANCE USE HIS STYLE OF ARGUMENT IS IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO KILL PEOPLE FOR FOOD WELL LET'S ASK THAT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FASHION IS IT OKAY TO FEED PIGS TO PIGS OR CHICKENS TO CHICKENS THE ANSWER IS NOPE ONE WAY TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF DISEASE IS TO FEED AN ANIMAL BACK TO ITS OWN KIND PIGS TO PIGS CHICKENS TO CHICKENS AND THAT IS NEVER APPROPRIATE PIGS TO CHICKENS OR CHICKENS TO PIGS NOT A PROBLEM SO IS IT OKAY TO EAT PEOPLE NOPE NEVER

WHAT ABOUT ALIENS WELL ALIENS BY DEFINITION EVOLVED ON A DIFFERENT PLANT AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO NUTRITIONALLY USE THE FOOD IN OUR BODIES SO IT'S PRETTY EASY TO SAY IT WOULD BE IMMORAL JUST AS MANY CONSIDER KILLING FOR THE HELL OF IT TO BE IMMORAL SIZE STRENGTH SENTIENCE DON'T EVEN NEED TO ENTER INTO THE QUESTION

IT'S ONLY BY UNREASONABLY RESTRICTING THE QUESTION THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO AVOID BASIC BIOLOGY AND THE REAL MORAL QUESTION

AND HERE I'M GOING TO GO OFF TO THE SIDE ABUT IS THERE A MORAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEEDING AN OBLIGATE HERBIVORE MEAT AND FEEDING AN OBLIGATE CARNIVORE A VEGAN DIET

AND IS IT APPROPRIATE TO FEED AN OBLIGATE CARNIVORES SUCH AS CATS A MEAT BASED DIET IS IT MORALLY APPROPRIATE TO FEED OMNIVORES SUCH AS SKUNKS AND MOST BIRDS MEAT OR TYLER PIG FOR THAT MATTER

IF IT'S APPROPRIATE TO FEED ANIMALS A DIET THEY HAVE EVOLVED TO EAT WHY WOULD IT BE WRONG TO CONTINUE TO EAT THE DIET THAT ALLOWED US TO BECOME HUMAN
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT OUR CREATOR GAVE US DOMINION OVER PLANTS AND ANIMALS ACCORDING TO THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OUR FOUNDERS WROTE THAT WE THE PEOPLE HAVE UNALIENABLE RIGHTS GIVEN TO US BY GOD NOT BY ANY MAN BECAUSE MAN CANNOT GIVE ANOTHER MAN HIS RIGHTS

THEREFORE IT IS MY RIGHT TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD NOT TO ABUSE IT IS YOUR RIGHT TO NOT KILL ANIMALS TO EAT DO NOT NOT MAKE A MORAL ARGUMENT THAT IT IS UNETHICAL TO KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NONE ANIMALS ARE NOT PEOPLE AS YOU SAYS IN THE VIDEO
I'M SORRY BUT HE AVOIDS ONE LARGE HOLE IN HIS GENETIC AND EQUIVALENCE ARGUMENTS THAT BEING HUMANS ARE CONSCIOUS SENTIENT BEINGS AND PIGS LIKE MOST ANIMALS ARE BIOLOGICAL ROBOTS GOING FROM DAY TO DAY EATING BREEDING AND SLEEPING WITH NO CONCEPT OF A HIGHER PURPOSE THEREFORE THEY AREN'T LIKE HUMANS AT ALL AS THEY DON'T THINK LIKE US HELL DO THEY EVEN THINK
I BELIEVE THAT MORALITY DOESN'T EVEN EXIST WHY BECAUSE IT DIFFERS IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHAT I THINK IS RIGHT AND WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT CAN BOTH BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS THEREFORE THERE CANNOT BE DEFINITION OF MORALITY IF YOU CANNOT EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO THE POINT OF WHERE IT HAS COMPLETE CONCLUSIVE AND UNBIASED EVIDENCE THEN IT IS NOT FACT THEREFORE MORALITY IS NOT FACTUAL AND THEREFORE WE CANNOT SAY THAT MORALITY EXISTS

WHAT YOU CAN ARGUE HOWEVER IS WHAT YOU YOURSELF DETERMINE IS GOOD AND WHAT IS BAD THAT BEING SAID WE CANNOT TAKE YOUR OPINION ON THE MATTER AND SPREAD IT AS LAW

I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT FEELINGS OF GOOD AND BAD SHOULD NOT EVEN BE CONSIDERED ON ANY MATTER EVERYTHING RAPS AROUND TO THE QUESTIONS OF AM I ABLE TO DO THIS CAN I GET AWAY WITH THIS WILL I SURVIVE THE CONSEQUENCES IF YOU ANSWER YES TO ALL QUESTIONS THEN I BELIEVE THAT YOUR ACTIONS ARE JUSTIFIABLE

BUT THEN YOU CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHAT IS TRULY DEFINED AS SURVIVAL IS IT DETERMINED BY LONGEVITY BY HAPPINESS OR BY AN EQUAL MIXTURE OF BOTH AGAIN THIS IS COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE AND DIFFERENT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL

AT THIS POINT IS WHERE I GIVE UP AND SAY THAT PHILOSOPHY DOES NOT HAVE A DEFINITE ANSWER OR AN END NO SUBJECT ABOUT MORALITY HAS A DEFINITE ANSWER AND I BELIEVE THAT A JUDGE OF CHARACTER IS COMPLETELY BASED ON WHAT EACH PERSON THINKS AND BELIEVES I THINK THAT GOES FOR ANYTHING DISCUSSED ON A PHILOSOPHICAL ANSWER


VERY INTERESTING READ THAT SUGGESTS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE INTRODUCTION OF MEAT INTO OUR EARLY HUMAN ANCESTORS DIETS AND EVOLUTION

THIS IS A STANCE I HAVE YET TO SEE TAKEN IN THIS THREAD AND ONE WHICH I FEEL JUST MAY BE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS IT MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO EAT ANIMALS

IT ALMOST RENDERS THE QUESTION OF MORALITY COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AND INSTEAD SUGGESTS WE CONSUME ANIMALS TO FACILITATE OUR OWN SPECIES EVOLUTION

THROUGHOUT HISTORY WE HAVE SEEN SPECIES THAT CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVE SURVIVE AND SPECIES THAT DO NOT EVOLVE GO EXTINCT OR AT THE VERY LEAST HAVE A MUCH HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF GOING EXTINCT IN THE FUTURE

IT IS INTERESTING THAT FOLLOWING THE PREMISE THE ARTICLE ABOVE STATES THE VERY PHENOMENON RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR EVOLUTION AND CONSEQUENT CONSCIOUSNESS OF MORALITY IS NOW IN QUESTION

LIFE ON EARTH HAS NEVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OR DILEMMA DEPENDING ON WHICH STANCE YOU TAKE OF QUESTIONING ITS OWN ACTIONS EVERY ACTION EVERY EXERTION OF ENERGY HAS BEEN OUT OF NECESSITY UP UNTIL THE POINT HUMANS DEVELOPED CONSCIOUSNESS AND EVENTUALLY MORALITY IT IS ONLY NOW IN A POSITION OF RELATIVE SAFETY AND COMFORT THAT WE CAN QUESTION WHY WE DO THE THINGS WE DO AND LIVE THE WAY WE LIVE

IT IS HARD TO SPECULATE WHERE WE WOULD BE AS A SPECIES ON THE EVOLUTIONARY SCALE HAD WE NOT MADE THE TRANSITION TO BECOMING OMNIVOROUS BUT IF THERE IS MERIT TO THE IDEA THAT MEAT-EATING WAS AND MAY VERY WELL STILL BE THE CATALYST TO OUR EVOLUTION AS A SPECIES THEN WHY QUESTION IT

IRONICALLY WHILE WE ARE AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN I STILL FEEL THAT HUMANS ARE NOT AS SAFE AND SECURE IN TERNS OF OUR SPOT ON THIS PLANET THAN WE MIGHT THINK AGAIN WITH IRONY THIS IS BECAUSE OF WHERE WE ARE ON OUR JOURNEY THROUGH EVOLUTION WHILE WE HAVE BECOME MORE DOMINANT OVER THE SPECIES BELOW US WE HAVE BECOME EQUALLY MORE DANGEROUS TO OUR OWN KIND

THIS I BELIEVE IS WHY WE MUST ADOPT INCREASINGLY MORALLY ACCEPTABLE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS FOR CONSUMPTION AND CONTINUE ON OUR CURRENT PATHOLOGY

I'M SURE MOST OF US ARE AWARE THAT WE CURRENTLY EMPLOY RATHER INHUMANE PRACTICES IN REGARDS TO OUR TREATMENT OF LIVESTOCK AND THIS IS WHAT MUST CHANGE

NOT AS THIS VIDEO SEEMS TO SUGGEST OUR CONSUMPTION OF ANIMALS IN THE FIRST PLACE
IF ANIMALS CAN EAT MEAT THEN SO CAN WE AND JUST SO THE VEGANS KNOW PLANTS DO SPEAK THROUGH SCENTS THEY GIVE OFFICIAL THAT SMELL EVERYONE ENJOYS OF FRESH CUT GRASS AFTER ITS BEEN MOWED YEAH THAT'S THE GRASS SCREAMING IN PAIN EVERY ANIMAL INCLUDING HUMANS SURVIVE BY EATING SOMETHING THAT IS ALIVE WHETHER IT BE OTHER ANIMALS OR PLANTS SAYING ONE IS MORE ETHICALLY SOUND TO EAT THAN THE OTHER IS SMALL MINDED THAT BEING SAID IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ALRIGHT TO TORTURE OUR FOOD EITHER EACH ANIMAL SHOULD BE TREATED WELL AND GIVEN A QUICK PAINLESS DEATH IT'S THE LEAST WE CAN DO TO THANK IT FOR FEEDING US AND ALLOWING US TO LIVE LONG HEALTHY LIVES
SOME OTHER FUEL FOR THE FIRE THOSE ANIMALS WOULD FOR THE MOST PART NEVER EXIST AT ALL IF NOT FOR HUMAN CULTIVATION ALSO THOSE LIVES THAT DID EXIST WOULD BE MOST OFTEN BE SHORTER AND MORE BRUTAL THAN THE RELATIVE EASE WE RAISE OUR LIVESTOCK IN

I BELIEVE WE SHOULD SEEK ETHICAL MEAT AND REFRAIN FROM THINGS LIKE VEAL BUT I WILL PROBABLY SWITCH TO LAB GROWN MEAT THE MOMENT IT'S VIABLE

THERE'S STILL A PANG OF REGRET IN THAT BECAUSE LIKE I SAID WHEN LAB GROWN MEAT IS VIABLE MOST OF THOSE ANIMALS WILL DIE AND NOT BE ALLOWED TO BREED AND WILL NOT BE VIABLE IN THE WILD
REMOVED
REMOVED
IS IT ETHICAL TO KILL PLANTS FOR FOOD IF IT EVER BECOMES PRACTICAL TO GROW MEAT IN A LAB WILL IT BE ETHICAL TO KILL THAT FOR FOOD IN ANY OF THESE CASES THERE'S A LOT OF LIVING MATTER THAT STOPS LIVING PREMATURELY SO THAT WE MAY CONTINUE TO LIVE

THE ARGUMENT AGAINST MEAT CONSUMPTION THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE TO ME IS THE UNSUSTAINABILITY OF IT FOR CURRENT POPULATION LEVELS I GUESS THAT MAY JUST BE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THE PRACTICALITY INSTEAD OF THE MORALITY THOUGH
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS GUY IS A TEACHER AT A UNIVERSITY BUT CAN'T ANSWER AN EASY QUESTION LIKE THIS ANIMALS DON'T HAVE RIGHTS WHEN AN ANIMAL CAN SAY DON'T EAT ME BUZ I WANNA LIVE THEN HE DESERVES RIGHTS IF NOT THEN MMMM BACON
IM GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL HURT MANY SENSITIVE HEARTS HERE BUT AFTER READING SOME THREADS I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MANY PEOPLE DONT KNOW

EVERY SINGLE ANIMAL AND SOME PLANTS ARE DESIGNED TO KILL ANOTHER LIVING BEING IN ORDER TO FEED HIMSELF

THATS NOT THE WORSE PART THE WORSE PART IS THAT MOST OF THEM DO IT IN A PAINFUL AND AGONIZING WAY UNLESS THEY ARE EXTREMELY VENOMOUS OR AN EXPERIENCED FELINE

THE HUMAN BEING IS OMNIVOROUS GET OVER THIS AND LET PEOPLE EAT WHAT THEY WANT RESPECT OTHERS DECISIONS AND ABOVE ALL RESPECT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS YEARS OF EVOLUTION
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE DEFINED BY THEIR PEOPLE NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND GOVERNMENTS SHOULD ALSO ALWAYS FEAR THEIR PEOPLE IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR BEST INTERESTS IN MIND
I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH AN ENGLISH TUTOR OF MINE NOT TOO LONG AGO ABOUT THIS

WE SETTLED ON A SUMMARY THAT I THOUGHT WAS PROBABLY MORE POWERFUL THAN I GAVE IT CREDIT FOR IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T ROMANTICIZE INDEPENDENCE
THINK FOR YOURSELF QUESTION AUTHORITY
MAN THIS IS A HARD TEXT BY ITSELF NOT BEING NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER MAKES THIS REALLY HARD TO COMPREHEND DOES SOMEONE KNOW A EASIER VERSION OR A GERMAN ONE
AMA

ROY T COOK CTA SCHOLAR OF THE COLLEGE PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA WILL BE DOING AN AMA NEXT TUESDAY AT EST ON PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS LOGIC AND COMICS HERE ON R PHILOSOPHY SEE THE ANNOUNCEMENT THREAD FOR MORE INFORMATION AND LEAVE QUESTIONS BEFOREHAND OTHERWISE YOU CAN TUNE IN TUESDAY AFTERNOON FOR LIVE Q A
HERE'S A RELEVANT QUESTION BY WHAT PHYSICAL PROCESS DOES THE BRAIN CONVERT A BUNCH OF NEURONAL PULSES IN THE VISUAL CORTEX INTO THE FABULOUS 3D VISTA THAT WE THINK WE SEE IN FRONT OF US
WOULD I BE WRONG OR IN BOILING DOWN THE CHALLENGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS INTO THE QUESTION DO I HAVE A BRAIN OR DOES A BRAIN HAVE ME


AM I IS MY TRUE IDENTITY SOMETHING WHICH USES THE BRAIN AS AN INSTRUMENT TO INTERACT AND ENGAGE WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD


OR


2 AM I IS MY TRUE IDENTITY THE BRAIN WHICH SIMULTANEOUSLY CREATES ORGANIZES AND EXPERIENCES A SELF-IMPOSED FLUID REPRESENTATION OF THE MATERIAL WORLD
BUT IT IS EVEN MORE PUZZLING THAT EXPERIENCE IS USUALLY DESCRIBED AS EXPERIENCE OF SOMETHING ELSE OF SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ME I EXPERIENCE A RED APPLE YOU EXPERIENCE A PIECE OF MUSIC RUTH EXPERIENCES A LANDSCAPE HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE SINCE IF WE LEAVE ASIDE QUANTUM MECHANICS FOR THE MOMENT OUR TRADITIONAL VIEW OF NATURE TELLS US THAT AN OBJECT IS WHAT IT IS AND NOTHING MORE WILLIAM JAMES PUT THIS VERY CLEARLY WHEN HE ASKED HOW CAN THE ROOM I AM SITTING IN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY OUT THERE AND AS IT WERE INSIDE MY HEAD MY EXPERIENCE WE STILL HAVE NO ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION

IS IT REALLY THAT PUZZLING HAVE THESE PEOPLE EVER SEEN A CAMERA IF YOU TOOK A PICTURE OF A DOG AND SHOWED IT TO MR MANICOTTI WOULD HE ASK HOW CAN THE DOG BE ON THE SCREEN AND OUT THERE AT THE SAME TIME
PERCEPTIONS ARE EXCLUSIVE TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHILE CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF IS UNIVERSAL AND OMNIPRESENT
OUT OF THE HUNDREDS OF COMMENTS I SEE NONE THAT HAVE RESPONDED TO THE CONTENT OF THE OP INSTEAD RIFFING OFF OF THE TITLE ACCORDINGLY FURTHER COMMENTS ON THIS TOPIC ARE NOW LOCKED
REMOVED
TO BE GIVEN ITS PROPER PLACE LET'S GRANT THAT THIS IS AT THE HEART OF UK EDUCATION WE NEED GOOD PHILOSOPHY TEACHERS

WHERE ARE THE THOUSANDS THAT ARE REQUIRED GOING TO COME FROM TEACHING PHILOSOPHY BADLY MIGHT BE WORSE THAN NONE AT ALL
REMOVED
LET S AIM FOR LESS MONOLOGUE MORE DIALOGUE

ESSENTIAL

ESPECIALLY IN A SCHOOL WHERE CHILDREN INTERACT FACE TO FACE ON A DAILY BASIS

IT WOULD HELP THEM TO SEPARATE THE SHALLOW MODES OF THINKING THAT THE VIRTUAL SPACE CAN ENCOURAGE BY ASSOCIATING THE TANGIBLE EXISTENCE WITH DEPTH INVITING INTROSPECTION AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO BRING THOSE INTERSECTIONS TO LIGHT IN CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH PEERS

I THINK THAT THAT IS HOW A GENERATION AND ANY COMMUNITY IS STRENGTHENED BY HAVING THOSE DEEP CONVERSATIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER WHETHER IT'S ONE ON ONE OR A SMALL GROUP
RHETORIC AND LOGIC BEGINNERS LEVEL AT LEAST IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT POLITE DISCUSSION WHERE VALID ARGUMENTS ARE USED TO DEFEND YOUR OPINION IS VERY HARD TO FIND THESE DAYS THESE THINGS SHOULD BE MANDATORY REGARDLESS THE DISCIPLINE YOU ARE LEARNING
THE ONLY POSTS I SEE FROM THIS SUB ARE THE ONES THAT MAKE THE FRONT PAGE AND THEY ARE ALWAYS THE SAME

LINK TO AN ARTICLE SAYING WE NEED TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY IN SCHOOLS

BUNCH OF COMMENTERS AGREEING THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF PHILOSOPHY WERE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

READ THE POST BEFORE YOU REPLY

READ THE POSTED CONTENT UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS GIVEN AND RESPOND TO THESE SUBSTANTIVELY IF YOU HAVE UNRELATED THOUGHTS OR DON'T WISH TO READ THE CONTENT PLEASE POST YOUR OWN THREAD OR SIMPLY REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING COMMENTS WHICH ARE CLEARLY NOT IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE POSTED CONTENT MAY BE REMOVED

THIS SUB IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TANGENTIAL ANECDOTES OR DANK MEMES EXPECT COMMENT THREADS THAT BREAK OUR RULES TO BE REMOVED
THE FACT THAT SCHOOLS TEACH RELIGION BUT NOT PHILOSOPHY IS SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS BAFFLED ME
TEACHING SCEPTICISM WOULD BE GOOD ESPECIALLY WHAT IS CLAIMED OR ASSERTED DURING THE REST OF PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL
AS SOMEONE WITH A PH D IN PHILOSOPHY WHO HAS BEEN SEARCHING FOR A FULL TIME TEACHING POSITION FOR THE PAST YEARS YES AND NOT JUST IN THE U KING
HERE IN THE U SOUTH MOST TEACHING SPOTS ARE FILLED ON A SINGLE CLASS CONTRACT BASIS YOU ARE PAID PER CLASS TAUGHT NO BENEFITS YOU CAN WORK FULL TIME CLASSES PER SEMESTER AND BARELY MAKE USD YEAR AND STILL HAVE NO HEALTH INSURANCE LOVELY
WHAT'S EVEN SADDER IS THAT MANY UNIVERSITIES ARE ELIMINATING THEIR PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENTS ALTOGETHER AND TEACHING THE FEW REQUIRED CLASSES THROUGH OTHER DEPARTMENTS LOGIC IS TREATED AS A MATH COURSE ETHICS IS TAUGHT THROUGH THE DRAMA DEPARTMENT DIALOGUES INTRO IS TREATED AS A LITERATURE FRESHMAN WRITING COURSE
REMOVED
REMOVED
A LOT OF WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS PHILOSOPHY NOW FALLS UNDER THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE ECONOMICS MATHS RELIGIOUS STUDIES ETC THE DEFINITION IS A NARROWER THAT SAID TEACHING RHETORIC AND LOGIC SHOULD PROBABLY BE MANDATED AT A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL FALLACIES EVERYWHERE HAH
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH THE EDUCATION OUR YOUNGSTERS RECEIVE BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG ONES FOR ME
IB IS GREAT THAT WAY THE SUBJECT THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE KIND OFF COVERS PHILOSOPHY AND HELPS WITH CRITICAL THINKING
AS A PHILOSOPHY STUDENT I THINK THIS IS A BAD IDEA HIGHSCHOLERS DONT NEED OVERTHINKING THINGS MORE THAN THEY ALREADY DO
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TAKING CLASSROOM TIME AWAY FROM IN ORDER TO FREE UP INSTRUCTIONAL TIME FOR PHILOSOPHY

THE SCHEDULE IS ALREADY FULL
ALL EDUCATION

ALL EDUCATION SYSTEMS ARE LOOKING FOR STANDARDIZE THE CONTENTS THE AIMS AND THE RESOURCES AND THE PROBLEM STARTS AT THIS POINT IN SPAIN PHILOSOPHY IS A SUBJECT SO TEACHERS ARE NOT QUALIFIED AT ALL IN PHILOSOPHY ONLY IF YOU HAVE GOOD LUCK YOU CAN FIND A TEACHER THAT REALLY LOVES TEACHING MORE THAN WHO WAS PLATO OR SOCRATES
AT MY CHILDREN'S SENIOR SCHOOL IN THE UK THEY TEACH RELIGION PHILOSOPHY AND ETHICS HOW WELL IT IN IMPLEMENTED I DO NOT KNOW ALSO NOT SURE THE GROUPING WITH RELIGION IS A GREAT IDEA
HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH CLASS WAS MY FIRST INTRODUCTION INTO PHILOSOPHY DEFINITELY HAD AN IMPACT ON HOW I THINK AND READ
IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT COULD THE PARENTS TRY TO TEACH THEIR CHILDREN TOPICS LIKE PHILOSOPHY NOT ONLY WOULD IT BE A GREAT WAY TO BE INVOLVED BUT A PARENT COULD ALSO LEARN A THING OR TWO ABOUT THEIR VIEW OF THE WORLD RATHER THAN HAVE A STRANGER TEACH IT TO THEM
IS THERE ANY ACTIVISM OR PETITIONS GOING AROUND TO GET THIS OFF THE GROUND
THE BIG BIG PROBLEM FACED BY PHILOSOPHY IN SCHOOL IS THAT IT HAS TO BE EXAMINED I CAN'T THINK OF A WAY SOMETHING SO OPEN AND THOUGHT BASED COULD BE

REMOVED
REMOVED
REMOVED
I RECENTLY WROTE MY IB EXTENDED ESSAY ON THIS EXACT TOPIC I ALSO USED THE ABIENT GREEKS AS SUPPORT FOR MY ARGUMENT BUT IT WAS PLATO NOT SOCRATES I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE ARTICLE EDUCATION NO LONGER FOCUSES ON THE GROOMING OF PERSONAL VIRTUES FOCUSING ALMOST ENTIRELY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND SOMETIMES WORK ETHIC
I STUDIED PHILOSOPHY AT A LEVEL AND ALTHOUGH I MAY NOT HAVE LIKED IT AT THE TIME I DO BELIEVE IT HAS MADE ME A BETTER MORE WELL ROUNDED PERSON IN A WAY THAT I LOOK AT THINGS IN A PHILOSOPHICAL LIGHT AND AM ABLE TO ENGAGE IN HIGH LEVEL CONVERSATION AND HAS HELPED ME AT UNIVERSITY WITH MY STUDY OF HISTORY
PHILOSOPHY IS TAUGHT AT GASES IN THE UK NOT MANY SCHOOLS OR STUDENTS CHOOSE TO DO IT BUT IT IS TAUGHT AT ACSE LEVEL AS WELL AS AT
SOURCE I AM A STUDENT LEARNING PHILOSOPHY IN ENGLAND
WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL IN INDIA WE HAD A SUBJECT CALLED MORAL SCIENCE IT WAS AN ATTEMPT AT PHILOSOPHY BUT BECAUSE MOST INDIANS COME FROM VERY DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS THE MATERIAL TAUGHT WAS INTENTIONALLY TAME SO AS TO NOT OFFEND ANYONE IN THE END WE MISSED OUT ON THE MEATIER DISCUSSIONS OF PHILOSOPHY ONLY FOCUSSING ON SOME FEEL GOOD STUFF THAT DIDN'T PROMOTE ANY FORM OF RATIONAL THINKING
CURRENTLY PHILOSOPHY IS PAIRED UP WITH RELIGION WITH MORE OF A FOCUS ON RELIGION THAN PHILOSOPHY IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW
PHILOSOPHY IS FOR THE LIBRARY NOT THE REAL WORLD
PHILOSOPHY IS WONDERFUL IN THE SENSE THAT IT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF HUMANITY BUT WITH THE GLARING PROBLEMS WE FACE SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND THE NOVELIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY FOR ENTERTAINMENT AS OPPOSED TO THE APPLICATION FOR SOCIETAL BETTERMENT ONE WOULD BE MODE INCLINED TO STRESS TEACHING SEMI COURSES AT LEAST IN THE USA WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY LIBERAL ARTS HUMANITIES PHILOSOPHY DEGREES AND FAR TOO FEW IN THE SEMI FIELDS
TITLE READS LIKE A START TO R JOKES
I WOULD SAY THAT NOT ONLY IN UK
TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IS AN INJUSTICE TO PHILOSOPHY
I TOOK PHILOSOPHY FOR A BIT BUT ENDED UP DROPPING IT AFTER A WHILE IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A LOAD OF AIRY-FAIRY BOLLOCKS
ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS
EDUCATION IN GENERAL NEEDS TO BECOME MORE ADAPTABLE TO INTROVERTED STUDENTS MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT INTROVERTS PRODUCE BETTER WORK IN A SHORTER TINE FRAME WHEN WORKING ON THEIR OWN AND YET SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO PUSH GROUP TASKS ONTO EVERYONE
WHICH PHILOSOPHY

NIHILISM NAZIS

UTILITARIANISM COMMUNISM

ENLIGHTENMENT DEMOCRACY AND IMPERIALISM COLONIALISM

OR MAYBE CULTURAL MARXISM
PHILOSOPHY IS A TOUCHY TOPIC FOR IT TO BE TAUGHT HERE IN THE U SOUTH ONE WOULD NEED A DOCTORAL DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY TO EVEN TEACH IT I DON'T SEE HOW IT WOULD BE TAUGHT IN A K EDUCATION HERE IN THE STATES OR EVEN ANYWHERE ELSE I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF STUDENTS AT AN EARLY AGE WOULD EVEN APPRECIATE THE SUBJECT IT WOULD BE ONLY A SELECT FEW IF ANYTHING
WHY DOES 2

WELL
THIS ARTICLE WAS HILARIOUS IT'S THE INTELLECTUAL EQUIVALENT OF LET THEM EAT CAKE

I'D MUCH RATHER TEACH KIDS FINANCIAL SKILLS AND TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT'LL HELP THEM EARN A LIVING NOT TO MENTION LEAD THEM TOWARDS STEM SUBJECTS WHICH OUR NATION DESPERATELY NEEDS
REMOVED
THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN WHEN MORAL PRIGS TRIED TO BAN COMIC BOOKS IN THE SOUTH SANE PEOPLE CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FAKE VIOLENCE IN A SHOOTER VIDEO GAME OR A VR GAME OR A MOVIE OR A NOVEL INSANE PEOPLE WELL THEY'LL ALWAYS BE WITH US AND THAT'S A DIFFICULT PROBLEM BUT LIMITING ENTERTAINMENT CHOICES BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE CONTENT IS THE WORST KIND OF CENSORSHIP YOU'RE ASSUMING PEOPLE CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REALITY AND MAKE BELIEVE

IS VR UNIQUELY DIFFERENT IT'S PROBABLY THE SAME THING THEY SAID WHEN SOMEONE FIGURED OUT HOW TO ADD SOUND TO SILENT MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY MOVES FORWARD TUT-TUTTING SCOLDS NEVER CHANGE
READ THE PLAY THE NETHER BY JENNIFER HALEY SET IN A NEAR FUTURE A MAN IS PUT ON TRIAL FOR CREATING THE MOST LIFE LIKE VIRTUAL SIMULATION EVER AND USING IT TO ALLOW PEOPLE WITH PARTICULAR TASTES AN AVENUE FOR DEVIANT BEHAVIOR VERY INTERESTING PLAY WITH THEMES SIMILAR TO THE OP
THE POSSIBILITY OF THE COMPLETE PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE OF KILLING SOMEONE WITHOUT HARMING A SOUL

OKAY SO SHE KINDA CONCEDES THAT YOU AREN'T EFFECTIVELY HARMING ANYBODY BUT THEN SHE GOES ON TO SAY

BEFORE IT BECOMES POSSIBLE TO REALISTICALLY SIMULATE THE EXPERIENCE OF KILLING SOMEONE MURDER IN VR SHOULD BE MADE ILLEGAL

WHY NEAR THE END OF THE ARTICLE SHE SAYS

IN AN IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE TO KILL SURELY A TERRIFYING ELECTRIFYING EVEN THRILLING EXPERIENCE BUT BY EMBODYING KILLERS WE RISK MAKING VIOLENCE MORE TANTALISING TRAINING OURSELVES IN CRUELTY AND NORMALISING AGGRESSION

I DON'T SEE HOW THIS ARGUMENT IS ANY DIFFERENT THAN SAYING THAT PLAYING NORMAL MAKES KIDS MORE VIOLENT EVEN THOUGH SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO CORRELATION
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

THE AUTHOR STATES REPEATEDLY THAT THERE'S A RISK IN THIS THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH COMPLETE IDENTIFICATION ARE UNKNOWN THAT WE MUST BE WARY IT'S CLEAR IN FACT STIPULATED THAT WE DO NOT KNOW THAT ANY HARM MIGHT COME FROM ALLOWING MURDER IN VIRTUAL REALITY AND BEYOND THAT IT'S CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT ANY HARM THAT MIGHT COME FROM IT CAN ONLY BE TANGENTIAL THAT NO ACTUAL PERSON CAN POSSIBLY BE HARMED IN VIRTUAL REALITY AND THAT IT CAN ONLY POSSIBLY BE THE CASE THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CORRELATION BETWEEN BRINGING HARM TO AN IMAGE IN VIRTUAL REALITY AND BRINGING HARM TO SOME LIVING BREATHING HUMAN

ILLEGALITY ON THE OTHER HAND HAS IMMEDIATE MEASURABLE AND UNDENIABLE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS MAKING A THING ILLEGAL BY DESIGN BRINGS HARM TO LIVING BREATHING HUMANS

SO THE AUTHOR IS ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD DELIBERATELY AND WILLFULLY BRING HARM TO HUMAN BEINGS BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE A RISK THAT ALLOWING THEM TO DO SOME PARTICULAR THING IN VIRTUAL REALITY MIGHT IN SOME WAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MIGHT AT SOME FUTURE POINT IN TIME COMMIT SOME ENTIRELY SEPARATE ACT THAT MIGHT BRING SOME HARM TO HUMAN BEINGS
BUT IF WE DECIDE THERE SHOULD BE LIMITS AND RULES IN AN ALTERNATIVE FAKE REALITY THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT OF EVEN USING IT IF WE HAVE TO ABIDE TO WHAT WE CAN OR CANNOT DO IN REAL LIFE

FOR ME MURDER IN VIRTUAL REALITY SHOULD BE AN ADD ON
WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN A BLURRING IF NOT A BREAKING OF THE LINE BETWEEN THE VIRTUAL AND THE REAL TO BE AN INEVITABILITY OF ADVANCING COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY THIS WILL MOST LIKELY INCLUDE AT LEAST SOME DEGREE OF ALL THE KINDS OF SUFFERING YOU COULD EXPECT FALSE MEMORIES SYNDROME ETC

THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING WITH CENSORSHIP OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CONTENT IS A JOKE AT THIS POINT THERE IS PROBABLY NO STOPPING IT TO DO SO WOULD REQUIRE A COMPLETE OVERTHROW OF ALL CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT TO MAKE THE SUPPRESSION OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY THE PRIMARY ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE

THERE HAS BEEN MORE SPECULATIVE SCIENCE FICTION WRITTEN ABOUT THESE ISSUES THAN YOU COULD CONSUME IN A LIFETIME WHAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN NOBODY REALLY KNOWS THIS SIDE OF IT THAT'S THE ONLY REAL MEANING OF SINGULARITY THE FACT THAT IT'S FINALLY COMING TO PASS RIGHT ON TRACK FOR THAT OLD GUESS SEEMS SURREAL ONLY BECAUSE OF THE ANTICIPATION IT HAS BEEN GIVEN

PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE THE END OF THE WORLD MAYBE THE END OF THIS WORLD BUT WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN ANYMORE WHEN THE WORLD IS ALREADY DEFINED BY CONSTANT CHANGES COMING FASTER THAN ANYONE CAN KEEP TRACK OF
A QUESTION THAT I BELIEVE SHOULD BE ASKED CAN BE ASKED WITHIN THE VIRTUAL REALITIES THAT OFFER THE OPTION OF MURDER WHY WOULD I KILL HERE BUT NOT OUT THERE

THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT REAL

IF IN A VIRTUAL REALITY I MUST SHOOT DOWN AN ENEMY SOLDIER OR BATTLE HAND TO HAND AGAINST AN ARMED ROBBER OR INDEED COMMIT AN ACT OF MURDER INTENDED BY WHATEVER CHARACTER I'M GOING TO BE PLAYING AS THEN I MUST UNDERSTAND THAT I AM NOT PLAYING MYSELF AND THAT I AM NOT INDEED ON SOME BATTLEGROUND IN SPACE OR FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE IN THE SUBURBS OR TRYING TO KILL UNCLE JOE BECAUSE HE STOLE THE LAST SLICE OF PIE SELF-AWARENESS IS KEY
IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE WOULD THINK BANNING CERTAIN TYPES OF PORNOGRAPHY IN THE UK WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA WHAT A STUPID IDEA EXCUSE ME A MOMENT REALLY UH HUH SO YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT THE UK GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY WANTS TO DO THAT AND HAS PROPOSED LEGISLATION
LET'S THINK ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO KNOWINGLY INTENTIONALLY KILL A PERSON ASSUMING IT IS NOT DONE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF RAGE REVENGE GIVING A SENSE OF JUSTICE EAST G MURDERING THE MURDERER OF YOUR SPOUSE OR PARENT YOU HAVE TO BE LACKING ENOUGH IN EMPATHY TO NOT CARE ABOUT THIS OTHER PERSON'S TERROR

THEY KNOW THEY'RE ABOUT TO DIE THEY KNOW THEIR CAREERS ARE OVER THEY KNOW THEY'LL NEVER SEE THEIR LOVED ONES AGAIN AND THEIR LOVED ONES WILL BE DISTRAUGHT OVER THEIR LOSS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THEY KNOW THEY'LL NEVER GET TO ENJOY THEIR HOBBIES AGAIN THEY'LL NEVER SEE ANOTHER SUNRISE SUNSET NEVER FEEL THE THRILL OF LIFE NEVER SEE WHAT THE FUTURE HAD IN STORE FOR THEM NEVER EXPERIENCE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GROW OLD AND MORE IN ORDER TO MURDER A PERSON YOU HAVE TO BE EMOTIONALLY CAPABLE TO NOT CARE ABOUT ANY OF THESE THINGS

YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THIS MOUNTAIN OF PAIN YOU'RE ABOUT TO CREATE FROM TOUCHING YOU OR OTHERWISE HAVE A WILL TO END THIS PERSON'S LIFE STRONGER THAN THE FEAR OF EXPERIENCING THE PAIN OF CAUSING ALL THIS PAIN SHOULD YOU NOT BE UTTERLY LACKING IN EMPATHY IT IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE PINNACLE OF INHUMANITY

NOW LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IT TAKES TO KILL SOMEONE IN VR HAHA YOU LOSE BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME

BOTH REAL MURDER AND VIRTUAL MURDER SHARE THE STRUGGLE THE FIGHT FOR ONE PARTY TO OVERWHELM DEFEAT THE OTHER IT DOES NOT HOWEVER SHARE THE EMOTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF SEVERING ALL THE TIES THAT MAKE UP A HUMAN LIFE SNUFFING IT OUT IT'S UTTERLY NONSENSICAL

I OWN A VR HEADSET AND I'VE EXPERIENCED PRESENCE THE SENSATION OF TRULY BEING THERE THAT THE WORLD YOU SEE IS AN ACTUAL PLANE OF EXISTENCE THAT ENCOMPASSES YOU RATHER THAN BEING A FANCY TRACKED IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE ZIPPING AROUND IN A SPACE FIGHTER AS I BLAST THE ENEMY TEAM TO BITS IT IS FULLY REALIZED VIRTUAL MURDER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AS A ANALOGUE WOULD I BE INDIFFERENT TO SIT IN MY OWN TANK BLOW UP ANOTHER TANK FULL OF PEOPLE GOODNESS NUMBER IN REALITY I WOULDN'T HURT A FLY THE IDEA OF CAUSING SOMEONE UNDUE HARM SUFFERING HORRIFIES ME

JUST MORE FUEL TO THE FLAMES OF PARENTAL TERROR OVER THEIR CHILDREN BEING BRAINWASHED TO VIOLENCE BY INSERT MEDIA HERE SIGH PERHAPS PEOPLE SHOULD START LOOKING AT HOW THEY TREAT ONE ANOTHER BEFORE POINTING AT THINGS LIKE MOVIES GAMES NOW VR AS SCAPEGOATS FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS OF SOCIETY
I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL BUT I DO THINK AS WE GET CLOSER TO BLURRING THE LINES BETWEEN WHAT IS REAL AND ISN'T REAL WITH TECHNOLOGY WE SHOULD CONSIDER ADDING SOME SORT OF CLEANSER OR STEP DOWN METHOD

WE ALREADY HAVE PEOPLE WHO GET SO PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED IN GAMING THAT THEY ARE PRONE TO OUTBURSTS OUTSIDE OF GAMES THERE ARE ALSO MANY MORE PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET THIS WAY

I PERSONALLY BELIEVE GAMING SHOULD BE MORE OF AN ADULT THING DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN BRAIN GAMING DOES HAVE SOME BENEFITS THOUGH AS WELL

I JUST HOPE IT'S BEING STUDIED MORE AS SOCIETY BECOMES MORE AUTOMATED WE'LL HAVE MORE OF A NEED TO PROMOTE A HEALTHY MINDSET AND THE CURRENT WAY OF GAMING AND HOW IT'S PERCEIVED BY SOCIETY WILL CHANGE

IN IT'S CURRENT STATE THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE WE NEED TO BE THAT DRASTIC

THIS ARTICLE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A DRESSED UP VERSION OF VIDEO GAMES MAKE KIDS VIOLENT

THE AUTHOR EXTRAPOLATES PEOPLE WILL GO COMMIT CRIMES BASED ON OTHER SITUATIONS ROOTED IN THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR AVATAR BEING MORE CONFIDENT BECAUSE OF A TALL AVATAR IS A SIGNIFICANT LEAP FROM VIRTUAL MURDER COULD LEAD TO ACTUAL MURDER

ADDITIONALLY THE FIRST VIDEO GAME STUDY SHE REFERENCES USED A SAMPLE SIZE OF PEOPLE THE SECOND CITATION IS WAAAF TL ROYAL I'M WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THE LARGER POINT IF HER TANGENTIAL RESEARCH WASN'T USED TO REACH A SPECIOUS CONCLUSION

THE LARGER POINT SHE'S MAKING AND IT ISN'T THE CLICKBAIT HEADLINE IS

VIRTUAL REALITY ALTERS OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PERCEPTION OF SELF SOCIETY MUST BE PREPARED TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AS VR BECOMES MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE

BUT THAT HEADLINE DOESN'T GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUE


I'VE ALWAYS LOVED LECTURES HE HELPED INTRODUCE ME TO A RANGE OF PHILOSOPHERS AND IDEAS LOOKING BACK I THINK MY FAVORITE LECTURES OF HIS WAS THE ONE ON AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM AND THE ONE ON AN INTRODUCTION TO KNOWLEDGE
ISN'T A DEROGATORY TERM TO AND THE PHILOSOPHY
COURAGE UNDER FIRE TESTING EPICTETUS S DOCTRINES IN A LABORATORY OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR PDF
THIS IS PRETTY GOOD IF A BIT TOO BROAD AND THUS A BIT TOO SHALLOW

THE AUTHOR HITS ON WHAT IS IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE POINTS REGARDING STOICISM IT'S OFTEN TREATED DISPARAGINGLY AS AN EXPRESSION OF POWERLESSNESS BUT IN PRACTICE IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE

IT'S SIMPLY A FACT THAT AMONG ALL OF THE THINGS THAT SURROUND AN INDIVIDUAL THERE ARE SOME THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN CONTROL AND OTHERS THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL CANNOT CONTROL ANY TIME AND ENERGY DIRECTED TOWARD TRYING TO CONTROL THAT WHICH CANNOT BE CONTROLLED IS WASTED AND NOT MERELY NEGATED BUT ILL-SPENT IT'S NOT MERELY TIME AND ENERGY THAT WENT TO NO PURPOSE BUT TIME AND ENERGY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TOWARD CONTROLLING THAT WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED BUT WAS NOT

FIRST AMONG THE THINGS THAT ONE CAN GENERALLY CONTROL IS ONESELF THAT IS THE CENTER FROM WHICH ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL RADIATE IT'S CLOSEST TO THE SOURCE SO TO SPEAK THAT'S WHERE ONES OWN ATTEMPTS AT CONTROL ARE MOST EFFECTIVE AND THE ATTEMPTS OF OTHERS THE LEAST OR MORE TO THE POINT THEY'RE POTENTIALLY THE LEAST EFFECTIVE FIRST IT'S NECESSARY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR SELF-CONTROL AND DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THAT WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED AND THAT WHICH CANNOT BE

THOSE WHO LUST FOR CONTROL OVER OTHERS ARE OFTEN CUNNING IN THEIR ATTEMPTS BRUTE FORCE IS THE LEAST EFFECTIVE MEANS REALLY IT'S FAR MORE EFFECTIVE TO MANIPULATE AN INDIVIDUAL SUCH THAT THEY CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THEIR CONTROL OVER THEIR SELVES FOR YOUR BENEFIT AS BUT ONE EXAMPLE THAT IS THE EXACT PURPOSE OF PROPAGANDA OF VIRTUALLY ALL EMOTIVE RHETORIC FOR THAT MATTER

STOICISM UNDERSTOOD AND APPLIED IS A COUNTER AGAINST SUCH MANIPULATIVE PURSUIT OF POWER AND THUS A POWER IN ITS OWN RIGHT THE STOIC NOT ONLY RECOGNIZES THAT WHICH CANNOT BE CONTROLLED BUT THAT WHICH CAN BE AND BY DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN THE TWO CAN DIRECT TIME AND ENERGY AWAY FROM THE FORMER AND TOWARD THE LATTER SO WHEN THE POWER MONGER SEEKS TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE INTO EXERCISING THEIR OWN SELF-CONTROL FOR HER BENEFIT THE STOIC SEES IT FOR WHAT IT IS AND SIMPLY REFUSES TO GRANT HER ENTRY THE STOIC SIMPLY RECOGNIZES AND MAINTAINS CONTROL OF THAT WHICH SHE CAN CONTROL HERSELF

IT'S LITTLE WONDER REALLY THAT NIETZSCHE AND SO MANY OF HIS DEVOTEES ARE SO HOSTILE TOWARD STOICISM THEIR KEENING LUST FOR POWER BY WHICH THEY SO OFTEN MEAN CONTROL OVER OTHERS IS SIMPLY NEGATED BY THE STOIC REFUSING TO INDULGE THEM REFUSING TO EXERCISE HIS SELF-CONTROL FOR THEIR BENEFIT ULTIMATELY THEN THE STOIC IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THEY ARE AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY GALLS
AGREED THIS OUTLINED MY BELIEFS FAR BETTER THAN I HAVE EVER EXPLAINED THEM HAPPY I TOOK THE TIME TO READ THANKS
THANKS OP THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING
HAD TO BE DONE TO BACK UP WHY INDIFFERENCE IS A POWER GEORGE CARLIN WHY ITS IMPORTANT TO NOT GIVE A SHIT

IT MY OPINION IT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WORD AND A SENTIMENT AND PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO APOLOGISE FOR USING A WORD IF THERE WAS NO INTENDED MALICE

EVEN IN THE VIDEO YOU LINKED TO BOTH THE PRESENTER AND THE OTHER GUEST WERE CLEARLY SURPRISED BY THE USE OF THE WORD BUT TO MY EYES NEITHER APPEARED AFFRONTED
REMOVED
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE POSITION SAYING THAT MAKING THE SO POLITICALLY INCORRECT TO SAY THAT GIVES IT MORE POWER WHEN THE RACISTS USE IT

NOW THIS IS PROB GOING TO SOUND NAIVE BUT I USED TO HOPE THAT THROUGH RAP WHICH SOME ARE SURPRISED TO LEARN IS LARGELY LISTENED TO BY WHITES THE WOULD SLOWLY BECOME VIEWED AS AN ENDEARING WORD INSTEAD OF DEROGATORY ONE

I'M WHITE AND ME AND MY BEST FRIENDS FAVORITE ARTIST WAS LIL WAYNE FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE SONG HE SAYS I RIDE FOR MY MOTHER FUCKING NIGGARD I DIE FOR MY MOTHER FUCKING NIGGARD THAT IS SUCH A POWERFUL STATEMENT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY OTHER WORD THAT YOU COULD SUBSTITUTE FOR NIGGARD THAT WOULD BE AS POWERFUL

IN HIGH SCHOOL MY CLOSE FRIENDS WOULD THEN SAY THINGS LIKE MY NIGGRA TO EACH OTHER BUT IT WAS REALLY JUST A WAY TO SAY MY BEST FRIEND THERE WAS NO RACIAL CONTEXT TO IT OTHER THEN WE KNEW WHAT IT COULD MEAN IN A RACIAL CONTEXT BUT NONE OF US WERE RACIST AT ALL WE JUST ADMIRED THE COMRADERY AND BOND THAT THE WORD REPRESENTED WHEN WAYNE USED IT IN AN ENDEARING CONTEXT AND WANTED TO EMULATE IT

I STILL LISTEN TO RAP AND AM STILL INCLINED TO THINK IN MY HEAD THATS MY NIGGRA WHEN I SEE MY BEST FRIENDS EVEN THOUGH I WOULD NEVER THINK TO UTTER THAT WORD OUT LOUD ANYMORE AND ACTUALLY FEEL GUILTY FOR SAYING THAT I THINK IT
FOR FULL DISCLOSURE ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST KAISER HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR MAKING THAT STATEMENT SINCE IT WAS APPARENTLY FALSE


IN THIS CASE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOUR ARGUMENT REGARDING THE MORALITY OF THE MENTION OF THIS WORD IS AFFECTED
I MEAN COME ON NOW THERE REALLY IS NO NEED FOR THIS RIDICULOUS DISTINCTION BETWEEN SAID AND USED THE WORD CUNT IN AMERICA IS VIEWED AS A DISGUSTING FEMALE SLUR NEVER TO BE SAID WHILE IN AUSTRALIA ITS A UNISEX PRONOUN THAT IS USED IN CASUAL CONVERSATIONS WORDS HAVE WHATEVER INTRINSIC VALUE YOU APPLY TO THEM AND CENSORING THEM JUST AMPLIFIES WHATEVER NEGATIVE VALUES THEY HAVE WITH THEM I THINK THAT THE AND COMMUNITIES HAD THE RIGHT IDEA WITH DEFAMING THE WORDS AND USING THEM IN A POSITIVE LIGHT SUCH AS WITH NIGGER OR FAG A WORD ONLY HAS AS MUCH MEANING AS YOU APPLY TO IT AND INSTEAD OF CENSORING PEOPLES LANGUAGE I THINK WE NEED TO TEACH PEOPLE ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN THAT WORDS ARE JUST WORDS AND THAT A PERSON'S ACTIONS AND ATTITUDES ARE WHAT DEFINES THEM
WE HAVE ALL LEARNED THAT EVEN MENTIONING THE WORD VOLDEMORT CAN HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES

BY MENTIONING THE WORD WE CALL ATTENTION TO IT AND THEREBY STRENGTHEN ITS PRESENCE IN THE VOCABULARY EVEN IF LESS THAN USING THAT SAME WORD SO PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE ASKED IF THE ACT OF MENTIONING THE WORD IS JUSTIFIED BY THE CONTEXT
I TAKE IT PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE AGREES THAT MENTIONING A SLUR IS GENERALLY BETTER THAN USING A SLUR WHEN SOMEONE SAYS DON'T USE THE ON MY SHOW THEY'RE USING USE IN THE COLLOQUIAL SENSE ACCORDING TO WHICH UTTERING A WORD IS USING A WORD NOT IN THE TECHNICAL SENSE WHICH YOU'RE BRINGING UP HERE ACCORDING TO WHICH USING A WORD IS DISTINCT FROM MENTIONING IT YOU CAN'T EXPECT NORMAL PEOPLE TO USE WORDS IN ODD WAYS THAT PHILOSOPHERS USE THEM TO MAKE TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS NORMAL PEOPLE WILL USE WORDS IN NORMAL WAYS TO TALK ABOUT NORMAL THINGS IN FACT THE ARTICLE YOU LINK ON THE HUFFINGTON POST USES SAYS RATHER THAN USES SAYS ENCOMPASSES USE AND MENTION ALREADY
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAY THE YOU GIVE THE WORD MUCH MORE POWER AND MAKE IT EVEN MORE TABOO IF YOU ACTUALLY EXPECT TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR YOU SHOULD TAKE TO MAKING THE WORD HAVE LESS MEANING THE SENTIMENT IS THE NAME IS THE SAME IN SAYING EITHER NIGGER OR SO I DON'T SEE ANY NEED FOR OFFENSE ALL YOU DO IS AVOID THE PROBLEM AND MAKE THE WORD MORE POWERFUL THAN IT NEEDS TO BE
GREAT POST I THOUGHT THIS WAS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD BUT IT SEEMS THAT IT IS LESSER AND LESSER SO

TV NEWS
SO ONE THING I DON'T UNDERHAND IS THAT YOU CAN'T SAY NIGGER BUT SAYING THE N WORD IS TOTALLY FINE
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT WORD BOTHERS BLACKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN CONDITIONED TO BE OFFENDED BY IT WORDS ARE WORDS IF ONE BOTHERS YOU MORE THAN ANOTHER YOU ARE A WEAK AND HAVE IMPULSE CONTROL ISSUES AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A VIBRATION IN YOUR EAR DRUM THAT YOUR CONDITIONED MIND DECIPHERS AND CONCEPTUALIZES THE SIMPLE FACT YOU POSE THE QUESTION IN ABBREVIATED FORMAT N WORD SUMS IT UP IS THERE ANY OTHER WORD IN YOUR VOCABULARY THAT YOU ARE TOO SCARED TO TYPE FROM THE SAFETY OF YOU KEYBOARD

NOT RELATED TO THE MAIN POINT BUT SINCE YOU CONSIDER PUSSY A SEXIST SLUR WOULD YOU CONSIDER DICK ONE AS WELL
THE FACT THAT THIS DISCUSSION IS CALLED FOR SHOULD GIVE YOU DOUBTS ABOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITION OF THE MORALITY OF LANGUAGE

IT'S NOT THAT MENTIONING A WORD CAN BE LESS IMMORAL THAN USING IT IT'S THAT THEY'RE EXACTLY EQUALLY MORAL BECAUSE LANGUAGE HAS NO MORALITY

OR ACTUALLY THAT MORALITY HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CONSISTENT MEANING AND IS IN FACT AN OVERALL NEGATIVE PROPOSITION BEING ESSENTIALLY A TERM FOR ETHICS BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS IMPULSES BUT THAT'S PROBABLY A DIFFERENT DEBATE
I THINK THE DISTINCTION IS A VERY INTERESTING ONE AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME AWARE OF IT I DON'T FEEL QUALIFIED WELL-POSITIONED TO EXPRESS MYSELF ON THE ACTUAL DEBATE IN QUESTION BUT WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THE TIL
DYSPHEMISM ARE BAD WORDS THAT ARE USED TO CONVEY MEANING RELATED TO ASSESSMENT OF THE OBJECT OF SPEECH AND THE EMOTIONAL STATE OF THE SPEAKER IN RELATION TO THAT OBJECT OF SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE IN UTTERING CLEAN UP THAT WHERE THE BLANK IS COMPLETED WITH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING WORDS PILE MESS GARBAGE CRAP SHIT THE SPEAKER MAY BE DIRECTING THAT THE SAME THINGS BE CLEANED UP BUT THE CHOICE OF WORDS ISN'T DENOTING DIFFERENT OBJECTS TO CLEAN BUT RATHER THE ASSESSMENT OF THEM AND OR THE EMOTIONAL STATE OF THE SPEAKER IN RELATION TO THEM BECAUSE THE LISTENERS ARE USED TO ATTRIBUTING EMOTIONAL FREIGHT TO DYSPHEMISM THE WORDS AND PHRASES THEMSELVES CAN ELICIT SUCH REACTIVE EMOTIONS IN THE AUDIENCE CONSEQUENTLY WHEN IN POLITE COMPANY WE DON'T STIR UP EMOTIONS UNNECESSARILY EVEN AS MENTIONS IN FORMAL SETTINGS SAY A COURTROOM YOU WOULDN'T SAY THE WORST OF THE DYSPHEMISM EVEN AS A MENTION UNLESS IT WAS IMPORTANT EVIDENCE

WITH RESPECT TO SAYING THE ON A NEWS PROGRAM EVEN AS A MENTION THE ARGUMENT WOULD HINGE ON THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE AUDIENCE'S NEED TO HEAR THAT WORD AND DAMAGE DONE BY MENTIONING IT AS WE'VE SHOWN IT'S POSSIBLE TO MENTION THE WITHOUT REPEATING THE WORD ITSELF
IT IS NOT MORALLY WRONG IT IS AESTHETICALLY WRONG
I FIND IT ABSOLUTELY REPUGNANT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO JUSTIFY IN REGARD TO THE COMPLETELY NEUTRAL USE OF A SLUR ON MORAL GROUNDS WITH THAT SAID I WOULD NEVER USE THE WORD IN CASUAL CONVERSATION NOT BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOUR SENTIMENT BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU HAVE FOSTERED SUCH DISCOMFORT AROUND THE WORD IN THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE THAT I COULD FACE POTENTIAL VIOLENT REPROACH FOR MERELY UTTERING IT

I TAKE THAT AS A GIVEN IF YOU NEED AN ARGUMENT FOR THIS LOOK ELSEWHERE

THIS KIND OF SUPPOSITION IS JUST EMBARRASSING TO READ
SOME WORDS ARE SO LOADED THAT MENTION APPEARS TO BE A CASE OF USE MANY FOR EXAMPLE TOOK IT TO BE RACIST WHEN RIGHT-WING PUNDITS REFERRED TO THE PRESIDENT AS BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA EVEN THOUGH THAT IS HIS NAME BECAUSE IT WAS FELT THAT THE CONSTANT MENTION OF HIS MIDDLE NAME WAS INTENTIONALLY USED TO CREATE THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT HE IS MUSLIM

FOR BETTER OR WORSE THE DREADED IS IN THE SAME CATEGORY WHICH IS WHY WE CAN ONLY SPEAK OF IT UNDER PARTIAL ERASURE AND WHY YOU HAD TO USE A TRIGGER WARNING FOR ALL THE SNOWFLAKES WHO CAN'T HANDLE A DIRECT QUOTATION WHICH DIRECTLY BEARS ON THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING I EAST YOU'VE PERFORMATIVELY CONCEDED MY POINT DESPITE YOUR ATTEMPT TO CLAIM USE AND MENTION ARE NOT THE SAME THING

WE LIVE IN A HOSTILE POLITICAL CLIMATE WHERE AMBIGUITY POLYSEMY AND INSINUATION WILL INCREASINGLY BE THE NORM WE NOW LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE STREET URBAN AND THUG SERVE AS RACIAL STAND INS

THIS FUTURE DOES NOT REQUIRE PHILOSOPHERS TO LOBBY FOR DISTINCTIONS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOST BUT RHETORICIANS WHO CAN HELP LANGUAGE USERS ACQUIRE THE COPIOUSNESS OF SPEECH REQUIRED SKIRT LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT POLICE AS OUR POLITICS BECOME MORE SEVERE OUR LANGUAGE BECOMES MORE SLIPPERY A NECESSARY ACCOMMODATION TO KEEP THE MARKET OF THOUGHT OPEN



PUSSY IS A CONTEXTUAL SLUR BUT UNIQUE IN THE FACT THAT THE PERSON ITS USED ON IS USUALLY NOT AFFECTED BY THE MEANING BEHIND IT SINCE THAT FORM OF ITS USE IS ROOTED IN MISOGYNY VAGINA FEMALE FEMININE WEAK

THE IS A RACIALLY DIVISIVE DEHUMANISING TERM

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TERM WHITE TRASH

ALL THE DOES IS DIRECT ATTENTION TO SOMEONE'S SKIN THE PHRASE WHITE TRASH BOTH DIRECTS ATTENTION TO SOMEONE'S SKIN AND THEN VERY EXPLICITLY DEFINES THEM AS HUMAN TRASH

I CAN'T THINK OF A PHRASE THAT IS MORE DEHUMANIZING THAN WHITE TRASH YET THERE IS LESS TABOO AROUND IT THAN THE

I DON'T THINK RICH EDUCATED WHITE PEOPLE PROPERLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXTENT TO WHICH POOR WHITE FOLK GET SYSTEMATICALLY DEHUMANIZED EVERYDAY
I DISAGREE WITH YOUR THESIS I DON'T THINK MENTIONING THE WORD IS ANY LESS OFFENSIVE THAN USING IT OK MAYBE SLIIIIGHTLY LESS BUT NEGLIGIBLE AS YOU SEEM TO HAVE FELT YOURSELF EVEN MENTIONING THE WORD IS UNCOMFORTABLE AND INAPPROPRIATE WHICH IS WHY YOU SAY INSTEAD OF THE WORD EVEN WHEN NOT USING IT I THINK U MAGNANIMOUS 2 IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK ABOUT THE SHOCK VALUE THAT WORD AND OTHER UNMENTIONABLE WORDS HAVE AND THAT THE SHOCK IT PROVIDES TO THE ARGUMENT STATEMENT IS THE PURPOSE FOR USING AND OR MENTIONING IT THEREFORE EVEN WHEN UTTERED AS A MENTION THE ULTIMATELY EXPLOITS THE DENSE PAINFUL HISTORY OF THAT WORD AND THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM IT FOR NO PURPOSE OTHER THAN SHOCK AND AWE I GET THAT YOU MENTIONED THE WORD FOR CLARITY SAKE SO THERE WAS NO INTENT TO SHOCK OR OFFEND BUT YOU CAN STILL DIFFERENTIATE USING ASTERISKS I E VS N R ULTIMATELY IT IS CLUNKY AND DIFFICULT TO AVOID THE WORD ENTIRELY WHEN IT IS THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION BUT TOO BAD EVERY TIME IT IS UTTERED REGARDLESS OF INTENT IT CONJURES UP A SENTIMENT THAT IS ALL TOO REAL FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND MANY MORE AROUND THE WORLD TO MENTION USE REFER TO THE WORD IS TO SAY THAT THE DIFFICULTY OF NOT SAYING IT IS GREATER THAN THE PAIN THAT SAYING IT MAY CAUSE
I WOULD ARGUE THAT PUSSY IS A SLUR ABSOLUTELY SPECIFICALLY A GENDERED OR SEXUAL SLUR OTHERWISE I THINK YOU MAKE A REALLY GOOD POINT AND I REALIZE I DEFINITELY NEED TO CALM DOWN WHEN PEOPLE MENTION RATHER THAN USE THANKS FOR WRITING THIS
USING IT AND MENTIONING IT CAN BE THE SAME IN SOME SITUATIONS AND VERY DIFFERENT IN SOME BUT I THINK THAT REFERRING TO WORD NIGGER AS THE IS ACTUALLY WORSE AND FAR MORE RACIST THAN MENTIONING THE ACTUAL WORD THIS TYPE OF POLITICLY CORRECT SELF CENSORING IS A FORM OF CONTROLLED RACISM
REMOVED
I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BECOME MORE INDIFFERENT TO SLUR WORDS IN GENERAL UNLESS THEY ARE USED TO INSULT SOMEONE I SAY THAT FROM A STOIC POINT OF VIEW AS I SEE NO REASON TO BE OFFENDED BY A WORD AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I ALSO THINK THAT PEOPLE SHOULD REFRAIN FROM USING THEM RANDOMLY WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR REASON I SAW SOMEWHERE THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T SWEAR A LOT HAVE A HIGHER PAIN THRESHOLD WHEN THEY SWEAR SO WORDS SUCH AS FUCK WHEN USED PROPERLY CAN ACT AS CATHARSIS AND RELEASE EMOTIONAL TENSION

THE BOOK ABSTRACT IS AS FOLLOWS

THIS BOOK EXAMINES THE PABLO PARADOX A PARADOXICAL INFINITE SEQUENCE OF SENTENCES EACH OF WHICH ENTAILS THE FALSITY OF ALL OTHERS LATER THAN IT IN THE SEQUENCE WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION PAID TO THE IDEA THAT THIS PARADOX PROVIDES US WITH AN EXAMPLE OF A SEMANTIC PARADOX THAT INVOLVES NO CIRCULARITY THE THREE MAIN CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK FOCUS RESPECTIVELY ON THREE QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE AND HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT THE PABLO CONSTRUCTION FIRST THE CHARACTERIZATION PROBLEM WHAT PATTERNS OF SENTENTIAL REFERENCE CIRCULAR OR NOT GENERATE SEMANTIC PARADOXES ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM REQUIRES AN INTERESTING AND FRUITFUL DETOUR THROUGH THE THEORY OF DIRECTED GRAPHS ALLOWING US TO MAKE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS AND PURELY MATHEMATICAL ONES NEXT IS THE CIRCULARITY QUESTION IS THE PABLO PARADOX GENUINELY ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IS COMPLICATED ALTHOUGH THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION OF THE PABLO PARADOX IS CIRCULAR IT TURNS OUT THAT IT IS NOT SO IN ANY SENSE THAT CAN BEAR THE BLAME FOR THE PARADOX FURTHER FORMULATIONS OF THE PARADOX USING INFINITARY CONJUNCTION PROVIDE GENUINELY CONSTRUCTIONS FINALLY WE HAVE THE GENERALIZABILITY QUESTION CAN THE YABLOESQUE PATTERN BE USED TO GENERATE GENUINELY VARIANTS OF OTHER PARADOXES SUCH AS EPISTEMIC AND PARADOXES ALTHOUGH THERE ARE GENERAL CONSTRUCTIONS UNWINDING THAT TRANSFORM CIRCULAR CONSTRUCTIONS INTO SEQUENCES IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE SORTS OF CONSTRUCTION ARE NOT WELL-BEHAVED WHEN TRANSFERRED FROM SEMANTIC PUZZLES TO PUZZLES OF OTHER SORTS THE TEXT CONCLUDES WITH A SHORT DISCUSSION OF THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE PABLO PARADOX AND THE CURRY PARADOX
I HAVE TO GO WITH GRAHAM PRIEST IN SAYING THAT SELF REFERENCE IS INVOLVED HERE THOUGH I HAVEN'T REVIEWED GRAHAM PRIEST ARGUMENT SPECIFICALLY HERE IS MY ARGUMENT THIS IS ABOUT SETS RATHER THAN SELF REFERENTIAL ELEMENTS THE SETUP IS

FOR EACH I SI IS NOT TRUE
FOR EACH I 2 SI IS NOT TRUE

SO WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS A SET SI THE SET MEMBER IS A STATEMENT ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF SET SI WHICH BELONGS TO I EAST A CLAIM ABOUT ITSELF LIKEWISE FOR SET ELEMENT SO BOTH SET ELEMENT AND ARE MAKING CLAIMS NOT ONLY ABOUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE SET BUT ALSO ABOUT THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER YOU CAN'T ESCAPE SELF REFERENCE BY INVOKING A SET WHEN THE ELEMENT THAT SETS THAT TRUTH VALUE IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE SAME SET
PERSONALLY I FIND IT INTUITIVE THAT PARADOXES ARE BASED IN INFINITY SEQUENCES WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF STEPS AND THEREFORE WHICH WILL NEVER COMPLETE CIRCULARITY IS SIMPLY THE REPRESENTATION OF INFINITY ONE WE CAN MORE EASILY BUT EQUALLY INCORRECTLY BELIEVE TO BE EVIDENT IN NATURE THAN LINEAR INFINITY

IT'S PRETTY COOL HOW THE TOP UNVOTED POSTS IN THIS SUBREDDIT ARE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND USEFULNESS AND GREATNESS AND IMPORTANCE ETC OF PHILOSOPHY BUT ACTUAL PHILOSOPHY GETS MODERATE TO NO INTEREST

EASIER TO PRETEND
WHILE I APPRECIATE HIS LARGER POINT MANY PHILOSOPHIES AND CONCEPTS ARE ARCANE TO MOST PEOPLE EAST G I DON'T THINK EVERYONE NEEDS TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONTOLOGICAL TELEOLOGICAL AND COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS

THAT SAID I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD BE TAUGHT
CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION
THE MOST COMMON LOGICAL FALLACIES EAST G AD HOMINEM ARGUMENTS

BY SIMPLY UNDERSTANDING THESE TOPICS I THINK PEOPLE WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO SAY SOMETHING STUPID BECAUSE THEY'LL UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S STUPID
I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN PREACHING THIS FOR YEARS NOW IT'S NOT A PROBLEM SOLELY WITH PUBLIC EDUCATION I FEAR THAT THE CURRICULUM STEERS CLEAR OF PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES IT POSES TO RELIGION NATIONALISM ETC MAYBE THAT'S A CONSPIRACY THEORY BUT IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME

THERE IS FAR MORE PHILOSOPHY OFFERS THAN SIMPLY TEACHING KIDS CRITICAL THINKING AND HONEST REFLECTION IT ALLOWS YOU TO VIEW THE WORLD THROUGH DIFFERENT LENSES BUILDING EMPATHY AND SOFTENING THE CERTAINTY ONE OF THE MAIN INGREDIENTS OF DOGMA THERE ARE FEATURES OF PHILOSOPHY THAT NO OTHER SUBJECTS IN SCHOOLS TOUCH THAT I THINK COULD BE A CATALYST FOR DEEP SYSTEMIC CHANGES TO THE WAY WE THINK AND BEHAVE
REMOVED
EVERYONE WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF THEY WERE TAUGHT HOW TO THINK RATHER THAN WHAT TO THINK

THINK BACK TO WHEN YOU WERE AN ELEMENTARY STUDENT WHAT STANDS OUT MOST IS JUST HOW BORED WE ALL WERE WHETHER WE WERE ENGAGED STUDENTS OR NOT HOW RARE WAS THE FEELING OF ACTUALLY CONNECTING TWO DISPARATE CONCEPTS IN A LECTURE SETTING MOST OF WHAT WE WERE LEARNING WAS HOW TO SIT IN A CHAIR PATIENTLY AND TAKE ORDERS

WHAT STUDENTS REALLY NEED IS AN ARTIFICIAL MENTOR AND PROCTOR TO AUGMENT THEIR NORMAL LEARNING THEY NEED SOMETHING THAT CAN SHARE INFORMATION WITH THEM AS FAST OR SLOW AS THEY ARE ABLE TO LEARN AND NEVER GET WEARY OF THEIR PACING THE INTERNET FACILITATES THEIR INTERESTS BUT IT'S DIRECTIONLESS THEY ALSO NEED SOMETHING THAT CAN ROUTINELY QUIZ THEM TO ASSESS THEIR STRENGTHS AND PROGRESS CONSTANTLY RESHAPING ITS RUBRIC WE NEED TO GET YOUNG MINDS UP TO DATE QUICKER ON UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEMS WE OURSELVES CANNOT ANSWER INSTEAD OF SQUANDERING THAT VALUABLE TIME IN THEIR LIVES
REMOVED
I AGREE THAT TEACHING PHILOSOPHY WOULD IMPROVE THE SITUATION BUT WE KNOW HISTORICALLY THAT IT IS NOT A CURE FOR THE PROBLEM RATHER A SET OF TOOLS THAT PEOPLE OF BOTH GOOD AND ILL WILL CAN USE TO THEIR OWN OBJECTIVES

A PHILOSOPHICALLY EDUCATED SOCIETY IS NOT NECESSARILY MORE ENLIGHTENED BUT IT IS MORE ORDERLY THE MONSTER'S CONSPIRACIES ARE ELABORATE AND DIABOLICAL TO EVADE THE COMPLEX SOCIAL MECHANISMS THAT A CIVIL SOCIETY ERECTS TO KEEP THEM IN CHECK

ONE NEED ONLY LOOK AT EARLY CENTURY GERMANY POSSIBLY THE MOST SOCIETY THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN TO SEE THAT THERE ARE TRADEOFFS

THEN THERE IS ANCIENT ROME AND PARTICULARLY OCTAVIAN AUGUSTUS WHO USED HIS ARISTOTELEAN PLATONIST VIEWPOINTS ON THE STATE TO ERECT A TERRORIST AUTOCRACY FOUNDED ON DOUBLETHINK HIS PHILOSOPHIES DROVE HIM TO CREATE THE ILLUSION OF AN ARISTOCRATIC GOVERNMENT THAT IN TANGIBLE FACT WAS AND MURDEROUS ON A GRAND SCALE

WHEREAS SOCIETIES THAT WERE MUCH LESS ROOTED IN PHILOSOPHICAL RIGOR CAME TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN NATURAL VIEWPOINTS THAT WERE BENEFICIAL TOWARD SOCIETY SUCH AS ENGLAND IN PRECEDING CENTURIES AND THE UNITED STATES IN THE 2 DECADES

THERE IS NO DETRIMENT TO TEACHING PHILOSOPHY NONE WHATSOEVER BUT IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS A CATALYST FOR EXISTING BUT OTHERWISE FORMLESS MORAL THOUGHT RATHER THAN A MACHINE FOR PRODUCING IT WHERE IT DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST A NIHILIST WILL REMAIN A NIHILIST NO MATTER WHAT HE KNOWS HE WILL SIMPLY BECOME VERBOSE IN HIS PERVERSIONS AND THE PEOPLE HE DECEIVES BECOMES ELABORATE IN THEIR INTELLECTUAL GYMNASTICS TO ACCEPT LIES THEY WISH TO ACCEPTANCE
PHILOSOPHY FIRST HAS TO EVALUATE THE CLAIM THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A SOCIETY WHEN WERE WE LIVING IN A TRUTH SOCIETY IT SEEMS HIGHLY IMPLAUSIBLE TO ME AND IS IN ANY CASE ARGUABLE

IT SEEMS SOME PEOPLE FORGET THAT EVERY POLITICAL ORIENTATION HAS FACTS TO BACK IT UP
THEY'RE IN FOR A SAD SURPRISE IF THEY GO TO PHILOSOPHY TO SECURE THE CATEGORY OF TRUTH SPEAKING AS A PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHER YOU AIN'T GOING TO FIND THE SOLUTION THERE ON THE CONTINENTAL SIDE POSTMODERNISM AND OR HAVE LEFT LONG BEHIND THE KIND OF OBJECTIVE TRUTH WE'RE ALL BEMOANING THE DEATH OF IN THE ERA ON THE ANALYTIC SIDE THINGS ARE NO BETTER MORE PHILOSOPHERS ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN TRUTH PROBABLY OR WOULD CLAIM TO BUT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP EITHER THANKS TO THE DIVERSITY OF VIEWS ON THE ISSUE PRODUCED IN PART BY THE DEGREE OF SPECIALIZATION CHARACTERISTIC OF ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY TODAY
I THINK THE MEANING BEHIND THIS IS THAT THE MEDIA MAINSTREAM AND SOCIAL ARE CLEARLY PUSHING AGENDAS

REDDIN INCLUDED THE COMMENTS HERE CAN BE GOOD BUT THE POLITICAL ARTICLES CERTAINLY ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED

MR HIGGINS IS A FORWARD THINKING MAN WHO WANTS THE BEST FOR HIS COUNTRY
PHILOSOPHY MAY OR MAY NOT BE BE THE ANSWER FOR MORE CRITICAL THINKING
SOME EXCELLENT POINTS TO ABOVE ADHERE TO BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN

LET'S BE CLEAR THOUGH
ALL HE IS SAYING IS HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT WE'RE BEING DUPED BY THE ABUNDANCE OF INFORMATION WE HAVE


IT NEVER CEASES TO BOGGLE MY MIND THAT SO MANY PEOPLE GO AROUND SAYING EVERYONE IS LYING OR A CONSPIRACY YET THEY CANNOT SEE THE FLAW IN THAT LOGIC IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN YOU HAVE NO TRUTH TO COMPARE IT AGAINST TO MAKE THAT CLAIM IN THE FIRST PLACE
A NEW POLITICS OF FEAR RESENTMENT AND PREJUDICE AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE NOT LIKE US

THIS IS NEW

THIS IS ONLY GOING TO HELP IF THE SIMPLEST FORM OF THE GIVIN ARGUMENT IS CURRENTLY JUST BEYOND THE REACH OF A LAYPERSON ME UNDERSTANDING THIS ALSO ASSUMES THEY CAN BE EDUCATED TO MEET THE MINIMUM CAPACITY FOR UNDERSTANDING THE ARGUMENT IF GIVEN THE CORRECT TOOLS THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT GIVEN THE TOOLS THE OPERATORS WILL BE COME SKILLED WITH THEIR USE AND OF COURSE LASTLY THERE IS NO PREDICTING HOW COMPLEX THE MOST MINIMALLY COMPLEX EXPLANATION OF ANY GIVEN ISSUE WILL BE


I THINK MANY PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND WHAT PHILOSOPHY IS HENCE SOME OF THESE COMMENTS

SOME EXAMPLES OF PHILOSOPHY THAT WOULD BE PRETTY USEFUL TO SOCIETY ETHICS LOGICAL FALLACIES ARGUMENTATIVE WRITING POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND JUST THE MODE IN WHICH PHILOSOPHY IS DONE IS HELPFUL I EAST CRITICAL DISCUSSIONS AND DEBATE IN CLASS
POLITICIANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DISHONEST AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO LEARNING A BIT OF HOBBES AND LOCKE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT
I'VE THOUGHT THE SAME FOR YEARS WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT WHY STEM IS SO IMPORTANT AND I AGREE THAT IT IS BUT A SOLID EDUCATION IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY ARE JUST AS VITAL TO A FREE SOCIETY I'VE SEEN DOCTORS ENGINEERS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE ALL SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR OWN RIGHT BUT WHO DID NOT STUDY BEYOND THE MOST MINIMAL LIBERAL ARTS REQUIREMENTS SPOUT LOADS OF NONSENSE THAT IS OBJECTIVELY WRONG WE SOMETIMES THINK THAT ALL IT TAKES TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND HAVE A GOOD JOB THAT IS NOT ENOUGH IN A FREE SOCIETY EVEN A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE WHEN LEFT TO SELF GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE CATASTROPHIC MISTAKES

WE ALL NEED A SOLID EDUCATION IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY
I DON'T BELIEVE PHILOSOPHY ALONE CAN HELP THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE TOO MUCH INFORMATION AND IT'S OF QUESTIONABLE QUALITY EVEN IF WE WERE ALL RATIONAL ACTORS I BELIEVE MANUFACTURED NEWS AND DISINFORMATION WOULD STILL DRIVE WEB TRAFFIC AND SERVE A MEANS TO AN END

I'M SYMPATHETIC TO SOME EXTENT BUT SKEPTICAL

I DO THINK PEOPLE NEED TO GET SOME TRAINING IN REASONING AND I DO THINK THAT PHILOSOPHY IS ONE OF THE BETTER THINGS TO STUDY TO DEVELOP THOSE SKILLS

ON THE OTHER HAND HOWEVER IN THE U S AND MOST OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING WORLD THERE'S A FAIR BIT OF PHILOSOPHY IN SOME SENSE OF PHILOSOPHY BEING TAUGHT AT UNIVERSITIES AND IT'S ACTUALLY CREPT INTO SOME HIGH SCHOOLS EAST G VIA HIGH SCHOOL DEBATE AND IT'S CERTAINLY BECOME PART OF MIDDLEBROW AMERICAN CULTURE AND IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET

BUT MOST OF IT IS REALLY REALLY BAD BAD TO THE POINT THAT I'D CATEGORIZE IT IT'S REALLY MORE AN OUTGROWTH OF LITERARY TALKING ABOUT EAST G POSTMODERNISM POSTSTRUCTURALISM MORE RADICAL VERSION OF CRITICAL THEORY FOUCAULT DERRID LEOTARD ZIZEL THE LEAST DISREPUTABLE NAME YOU MIGHT ADD TO THE LIST WOULD BE KUHN

THESE ARE THE VERY MOVEMENTS AND FIGURES WHO HAVE BEEN MOST INFLUENTIAL OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY AND I'D ARGUE IN GENERATING AN ALLEGED SOCIETY SKEPTICISM NIHILISM RELATIVISM INCLUDING SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONISM ARE WILDLY POPULAR ON THE LEFT NOT THE RIGHT I AGREE THAT THESE VIEWS AND THEIR POLITICAL EXPRESSION POLITICAL CORRECTNESS BY WHATEVER NAME ARE COMPLETELY CONFUSED AND THE SOURCES OF MISCHIEF IN THE WORLD ESPECIALLY ACADEMIA

BUT ANYWAY ONE MIGHT SAY IT'S NOT THE ABSENCE OF PHILOSOPHY BUT THE PREVALENCE OF BAD PHILOSOPHY THAT'S BEEN THE PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT WILL BE HARD TO CHANGE FIGURES LIKE FOUCAULT ARE SEXY PEOPLE LOVE THAT SHIT IT'S A LOT HARDER TO GET PEOPLE TO SIT DOWN WITH SCOTUS OR KANT OR EVEN SAY PUTNAM AS IN ANY OTHER DISCIPLINE THE SEXY STUFF ISN'T EVERY GOOD AND THE GOOD STUFF ISN'T VERY SEXY

AND NOT ONLY IS THE SEXY STUFF NOT VERY GOOD IT ACTUALLY TEACHES BAD HABITS OF MIND AND METHODS OF REASONING IT'S BASICALLY THAT AIMS AT CONCLUSIONS IT'S REALLY THE LAST THING YOU WANT KIDS READING I'M NOT SAYING PUT IT ON THE INDEX OR ANYTHING BUT IF YOU DON'T BUILD UP YOUR REASONING SKILLS BEFORE YOUR EXPOSED TO THAT STUFF YOU'RE LIKELY TO BE RUINED FOR LIFE

IN FACT A REACTION AGAINST THE NUTTINESS OF PC WHICH IS LARGELY AN EXPRESSION OF BAD PHILOSOPHY IS PART OF WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE MOTIVATED TRUMPERY THOUGH IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE USE PC BASICALLY TO MEAN ANYTHING TO THEIR LEFT INCLUDING RELATIVELY CENTRIST LIBERALISM WHICH IS NOT WHAT PC MEANS


IMO THE ERRORS ARE MUCH LESS THEORETICAL THAN THE TRUMP LIES AND HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING AND HE DERIDES THOSE WHO DO KNOW THINGS AND HIS FOLLOWERS EAT ALL THAT UP THIS IS NOT A THEORETICAL PROBLEM HE AND THEY DON'T DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A BAD PHILOSOPHY THESE ARE VERY ERRORS AS OLD AS MANKIND

CAN TEACHING PHILOSOPHY HELP CURE THAT MAYBE HOWEVER WE'D WANT TO DO IT WITHOUT ERRING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION DISCUSSED ABOVE JUST BEING DOPEY AND NOT APPRECIATING EVIDENCE AND FACTS IS BAD ADOPTING A THEORY THAT ENTAILS THAT FACTS AND EVIDENCE ARE ALWAYS SOMETHING SOMETHING PATRIARCHAL SOMETHING CONSTRUCTS SOMETHING IS WAY WAY WAY WORSE

ALSO IT'S A LITTLE DICEY TO SUDDENLY TAKE THIS STANCE IN OPPOSITION TO A PARTICULAR ELECTORAL OUTCOME WE DON'T WANT PHILOSOPHY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS OPPOSED TO CONSERVATISM IT ISN'T FOR ONE THING UNLESS THAT MEANS IT'S OPPOSED TO TRIBALISM

I DUNNO MAYBE THE IRON IS HOT MAYBE WE COULD SAY TO BOTH SIDES SEE HOW WE NEED TO TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT IMPORTANT MATTERS TO THE RIGHT WE COULD SAY SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO TEACH PEOPLE TO THINK THIS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO EVALUATE THE POMO PC STUFF THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE INDOCTRINATED WITH IN COLLEGE AND TO THE LEFT WE COULD SAY SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO TEACH PEOPLE TO THINK THIS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DEVELOP DEFENSES AGAINST MINDLESS AUTOCRATIC PROPAGANDA

MPH MAYBE

I'VE HEARD STUPIDER PLANS

COUNT ME IN
REMOVED
MATH AND ALMOST ANY OF THE SCIENCES CAN TEACH CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE EDUCATION OF IRELAND BUT IN MY NY SCHOOL NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL NY SCHOOLS JUST MINE WE WERE TAUGHT PROOFS AND THE WHY'S WE WERE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEMORIZE WE HAD TO BE INDEPENDENT AND PROBLEM SOLVE WE HAD SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC AND REASONING BEHIND EVERYTHING

THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH IS THE PACE WAS SLOWER THAN EVERYONE ELSE BUT WHEN STANDARDIZED TESTS CAME AROUND THE CORNER MOST OF MY SCHOOL FLUNKED BECAUSE WE DIDN'T COVER MUCH OF THE TOPICS EXPECTED ON THE EXAMS BUT YEARS LATER PEOPLE FROM OTHER SCHOOLS THAT WERE TAUGHT MEMORIZATION FORGOT ALL THE MATH FORMULAS WHILE MY SKILLS WERE RUSTY IN MEMORY I WAS ABLE TO DERIVE THEM BECAUSE THE LOGIC STUCK WITH ME
SMART THING TO SAY FOR A PRESIDENT
I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN THE TOP RESPONSES THAT IS BECAUSE I HAVE RAISED KIDS WATCHED THEM SWALLOW VARIOUS FORMS OF INDOCTRINATION WHOLE AND THEN SEEN THEM RIGHT THEMSELVES

THAT INTERMEDIATE STEPS WERE SCAREY BUT I CONFINED MYSELF TO FEEDING THEM LITTLE BITS OF HARD INFORMATION AND LET THEM WORK IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES

THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN STUPID BUT THEY HAVE BEEN YOUNG AND LIMITED IN THEIR EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS SOUGHT THE TRUTH AND TRIED TO TELL THE TRUTH THEY HAVE EXPECTED THE SAME FROM THEIR TEACHERS WHEN THEY DO NOT GET THAT COGNITIVE DISSONANCE TAKES CARE OF THE FOOLISHNESS AFTER A WHILE
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN POST TRUTH FOR ME
I'VE BEEN SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING MAKING SOME VIDEOS OR POSTS TRYING TO HELP EDUCATE PEOPLE ON HOW TO DECIPHER WHAT IS A CREDIBLE SOURCE AND WHAT ISN'T

IT HAS BECOME A HUGE UNDERLYING PROBLEM AND AFFECTS ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT FACETS OF THE SOCIETY
I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A DIFFERENT SITUATION I'M FROM CHILE WHERE THE CORRUPTION AT POLITICAL LEVEL IS GETTING OUT OF HAND ALSO THESE SAME POLITICIANS ARE TAKING PHILOSOPHY OUT OF THE SCHOOLS

WHAT PRESIDENT HIGGINS IS PROPOSING TO DO COMES FROM THE SAME UNDERSTANDING THAT A LOT OF CHILEANS USED AS AN ARGUMENT AGAINST WHAT THE POLITICIANS WERE TRYING TO DO

THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE US MINDLESS CALCULATORS INCREMENTING MATH HOURS WHILE THEY ALREADY TOOK HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY

A LOT OF US ARE LACKING THE ABILITY TO QUESTION WHAT SHOULD BE EVEN ON A BASIC LEVEL IM NOT WELL VERSED IN PHILOSOPHY BUT WE ARE A SOCIETY OF PEOPLE THAT IS NOT THINKING BY THEMSELVES WE JUST ACCEPT WHAT THE TELL AS THE TRUTH AND IT CAN'T BE QUESTIONED BECAUSE IF YOU DO YOU WILL GET FIRED LIKE THE PROSECUTOR THAT TRIED TO GO AGAINST POWERFUL FAMILIES WITH POLITICAL TIES THAT JUST SECURED ALL THE FISHING QUOTA FOR THE CHILEAN SEA HE GOT FIRED AND HIS CAREER IS NOW PERMANENTLY STAINED THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS WENT RIGHT BY OUR SIDE AND NOW ITS TOO LATE

WE NEED MORE HIGGINS
ANNUAL REFRESHER COURSES IN LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING SHOULD BE MANDATORY CURRICULUM IF PEOPLE KNEW HOW TO IDENTIFY BULLSHIT AND ARTICULATE EXACTLY HOW IT'S BULLSHIT THE NATURE OF POLITICS AND POLITICIANS WOULD CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AND THE FOCUS MIGHT SHIFT BACK TO REPORTING FACTS RATHER THAN CREATING NARRATIVES
THE MOMENT SOMEONE USES THE TERM I IMMEDIATELY KNOW THEY ARE BIASED AS HELL AND INCAPABLE OF HAVING A CONVERSATION WITHOUT TALKING OVER THE OTHER PERSON AND HAVING A FIT WHEN A DIFFERENT OPINION IS PRESENTED

AND FOR THE RECORD A CONVERSION INVOLVES TWO OR MORE PEOPLE TALKING NOT ONE PERSON SCREAMING
REMOVED
I THINK THIS THING IS JUST THE POLITICAL RIGHT APPLYING POSTMODERN CONCEPTS TO THEIR IDEOLOGY
AFTER THE POLITICAL LEFT IMPLEMENTED A PHILOSOPHICAL SCIENTIFIC NARRATIVE THAT STATES YOUR FEELS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT CAN BE MEASURED THEY ADAPTED IT AND USED IT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSE
THEY OVER SAFESPACED THEIR OPPONENTS WITH SAFESPACEWALLS PAYED BY MEXICANS
I TRIED TO APPLY FOR JUST PHILOSOPHY AT A UNIVERSITY TODAY ITS IMPOSSIBLE EVERYTHING CLEARLY STATED THAT THEY ONLY HAVE DOCTORATE'S OF PHILOSOPHY WITHIN THESE GIVEN FIELDS SCIENCE MATH ETC ALL OF THEM WERE ABOUT DEVELOPING A THESIS AND PROVIDING SUPPORTING EVIDENCE WITHIN THAT FIELD OF STUDY YET A COURSE IN CRITICAL THINKING AND LOGIC NO LONGER EXISTS DEBATE IS FROWNED UPON AND NEW WAYS OF THINKING ARE REBELLIOUS IF THIS IS WHAT EDUCATION HAS COME TO NO WONDER THE AVERAGE PERSON JUST BELIEVES WHAT THEY ARE TOLD ON TELEVISION IS PHILOSOPHY SO DANGEROUS THAT ITS BECOME LABELLED POLITICAL SCIENCE OR HAS IT BECOME HAMMERED INTO SUBMISSION BY IDEALISM
I DISAGREE ENTIRELY THIS IS A PANIC TO RETURN TO TRADITIONAL SOLUTIONS FOR WHAT ARE NEW CULTURAL PROBLEMS CAUSED BY TECHNOLOGY

WE DON'T LIVE IN A SOCIETY WE LIVE IN AN ONE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS COMPLETE OBJECTIVE TRUTH WHAT IS TRUE TO ONE PERSON IS UNTRUE TO ANOTHER AND THAT BECOMES NO MORE CLEAR THAN ON THE INTERNET WHICH THE SPEAKER REFERS TO AS AN OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CREATE AN OUT OF SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE POSSIBLE TRUTHS TO CHOOSE FROM YOU ARE GOING TO CONSISTENTLY CHOOSE THE ONES THAT SUIT YOU

THIS IS NOTHING NEW THE THAT WERE BOUGHT WITH MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND YOUR CHOICE OF MAJOR NEWS OUTLET A DECADE AGO ARE BOUGHT TODAY WITH YOUTUBE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND FACEBOOK LIKES THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WE HAVE DATA ON IT TODAY

IF YOU TRY TO FORCE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT A TRUTH THAT IS MORE TRUE TO YOU YOU ARE DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF OPENING THEIR MIND PART OF PEOPLE THINKING FOR THEMSELVES IS THEIR RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS YOU CONSIDER WRONG

INSTEAD HE SAYS THERE ARE NOWADAYS SO MANY WAYS OF ACCESSING INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET WITHOUT EVER COMING ACROSS THE INFORMED CONTRIBUTION OF JOURNALISM

WHAT IS THE INFORMED CONTRIBUTION OF JOURNALISM AND HOW DOES IT RELATE TO THE TRUTH WE CONSISTENTLY LEARN MORE AND MORE HOW FALLIBLE ALL NEWS OUTLETS ARE NOT JUST THE ONES ON THE INTERNET

IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THIS SPEAKER IS UPSET WITH THE STARK REALITY OF A WORLD WITH MANY SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS AND IS HOPING THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO A TIME WHERE WE COULD TURN TO JOURNALISTS FOR OBJECTIVE TRUTHS AND PHILOSOPHY FOR ULTIMATE TRUTHS

DON'T GET ME WRONG TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IS DEFINITELY HIGHLY BENEFICIAL BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS PROBLEM

WE DON'T HAVE A LACK OF CRITICAL THINKING IN OUR SOCIETY THAT'S AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE TO THE REALITY OF NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND DECISIONS YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHY THEY CHOSE WHAT THEY DID SO YOU ASSUME THEY JUST DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THEIR DECISION CAREFULLY IT'S AN UNREALISTIC COP-OUT THEY MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION BECAUSE THEY THINK DIFFERENT FROM YOU AND YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEM WELL ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THEIR DECISION

THE RISE OF POPULISM AND FAITH IN ABSURD TRADITIONAL IDEAS IS NOT CAUSED BY LACK OF CRITICAL THINKING BY MASSES IT IS CAUSED BY AN ABUNDANCE OF IT UNTIL EDUCATORS AND LEADERS ACCEPT THAT WE WILL MAKE NO PROGRESS TOWARDS SOLVING THIS PROBLEM
REMOVED
I AGREE PROVIDED HOWEVER THAT THE PHILOSOPHY IS ACTUAL PHILOSOPHY NOT JUST HOW TO DO ESSAYS WITH A GENERAL THEME OF PHILOSOPHY THAT'LL HELP NO ONE
DO WE HAVE ANY DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY OR ANY EMPIRICALLY OBSERVABLE CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING WHAT IS AND ISN'T A SOCIETY
I BELIEVE IN AN IN TERMS OF THINKING INFORMATION REGARDLESS OF VALIDITY OR CLAIM IS STILL INFORMATION AT ITS CORE EVEN IF WHAT IS SAID IS FALSE WE CAN ESSENTIALLY SCRUTINIZE FILTER OR BREAK IT DOWN TO FIND THE BASIS OR SOME OUNCE OF TRUTH BASED ON THE CLAIM

MEDIA AS BIASED AT TIMES AS THEY ARE OFTEN GET THE SHORT END OF THE STICK WHERE THEY'RE BLAMED FOR LYING OR TRICKING THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THEIR JOB REQUIRES THEM TO SELL THE NEWS THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THEM MARKETING THE NEWS AMBIGUOUSLY TO CAPTURE OUTRAGEOUS INTEREST EVEN FOR A BRIEF MOMENT FOR THOSE WITH A KEEN EYE YES BUT THE PROBLEM ALSO LIES WITH THE AUDIENCE IN TRUTH THE MEDIA SHOULDN'T BE BLAMED FOR WHEN PEOPLE JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS HOWEVER IT IS TO BLAME WHEN THEY DO THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS DESPITE THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT OCCUR

TEACHING PHILOSOPHY MIGHT ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ACCUSTOMED TO THINKING CRITICALLY BEING ABLE TO QUESTION RATHER THAN TO ACCEPT OR REJECT IS DEFINITELY MORE BENEFICIAL WHEN FACED WITH A VAGUE AND LACKING NEWS HEADLINE ULTIMATELY SKEPTICISM POSSESSES MORE TRUTH THAN ARROGANCE OR IGNORANCE AND THAT AT LEAST GIVES US A GENERAL IDEA OF WHERE WE ARE

TL R I BELIEVE AND AGREE WITH TEACHING PHILOSOPHY TO THE PUBLIC AS IT LETS PEOPLE THINK AND CRITIQUE THE WORLD TO THEIR UNDERSTANDING RATHER THAN BE SWAYED INTO THINKING A CERTAIN WAY
FOR THOSE INTERESTED THERE'S A GREAT PODCAST BY THIS AMERICAN LIFE THAT DISCUSSED POLITICS AND IT'S PART IN THE US ELECTION IT'S ONE OF THE MORE RECENT ONES AS A VOLSCI GRAD I CAN SEE THIS BECOMING A PHD WORTHY TOPIC RATHER EASILY
REMOVED
REMOVED
LARGELY I THINK HE'S CORRECT IT COULD QUITE EASILY TIE IN TO SCIENCE THE LOGICAL SKILLS INVOLVED WITH CRITICAL THINKING
I BELIEVE THIS DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH BOTH POLITICS AND PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE PART OF COMPULSORY EDUCATION FROM YEAR TO THE SAME AS ENGLISH SCIENCE AND MATHS IS

HELL YOU COULD ROLL THEM ALL INTO A COLLECTIVE COURSE CALLED CITIZEN STUDIES THROW PERSONAL FINANCE IN THERE AND YOU HAVE A CURRICULUM FOR TEACHING YOUNG GENERATIONS TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT AND SOCIETY MINDED INDIVIDUALS
THIS ISSUE IS NOT RESOLVED WITH PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL THE QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF PHILOSOPHY WE SHOULD TEACH WE FIRST NEED TO REJECT THE PARADIGM OF NOMINALISM AND CARTESIANISM BEFORE PHILOSOPHY WILL BE OF ANY HELP
THEY DO KNOW PHILOSOPHY THEY JUST THREW OUT EVERYTHING AND KEPT WHAT THEY LEARNED ABOUT PATHOS BASED ARGUING
AN ANECDOTE HERE BUT I HAVE RECENTLY STARTED WITH CRASH COURSE PHILOSOPHY TO SEE WHAT THE ENTIRE THING IS ABOUT AND I'VE ACTUALLY FOUND IT INSIGHTFUL I WON'T CLAIM TO KNOW VERY MUCH BUT FROM THE LITTLE I HAVE EXPERIENCED I HAVE FOUND MYSELF THINKING MORE CRITICALLY ABOUT MY OWN THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIOURS IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO GET SOME PEOPLE TO REFLECT MORE DEEPLY IT'S AN EASY WIN ALMOST

SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THE TITLE WE WERE TAUGHT ABOUT ETHICS IN SCHOOL A BIT I BARELY REMEMBERED IT BUT I REMEMBER LIKING UTILITARIANISM AND BASED SOME OF MY BEHAVIOUR OFF OF MY LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF IT
MAYBE HEALING IS THE RIGHT WORD BUT I THINK THAT THIS ACTUALLY ENTAILS NOT A REMEDY FROM BUT AN ACCEPTANCE AND AFFIRMATION OF THIS NEW WORLD

THE WAY WE THINK OF NEWS IS UNTENABLE BIAS AND EDITORIALIZING IS NOT A SIN WE CARRY LIKE EXTRA BAGGAGE WITH THE TRUTH IN THE OTHER HAND BUT THE VERY LENS THAT MAKES CLEAR TO US THE OBSCURE FORCES AT WORK IN THE WORLD MADE ACCESSIBLE TO US BY THE STATE OF CONTEMPORARY COMMUNICATION

THE WORLD IS TOO BIG FOR ANY OF US AND WE ARE ONLY STARTING RECOGNIZE THE SHEER REALITY OF THIS OUR IDEOLOGIES LENSES THAT NECESSARILY FOCUS SOME ELEMENTS AND BLUR OTHERS FAIL TO REALIZE COMPETITION BELIEF SYSTEMS NOW MADE SO EVIDENT IN THIS WEB WORLD WE CLASH AND FEED OFF EACH NEGATION WE GROW APART AND USING THE SAME LOGIC COME TO MIRROR EACH OTHER

WE SHOULDN'T MOURN THE FALL OF TRUTH SOME METAPHYSICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE WORLD BEING WAS ALWAYS TOO GREAT FOR ONE IDEOLOGY TO ENCOMPASS WE SHOULD PREACH FLEXIBILITY AND PRAGMATISM BUILD THESE UP AS THE NEW TRUTH
PHILOSOPHY WOULD DEFINITELY CHANGE OUR FUTURE TOO BAD IT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON THEY ARE TOO BUSY TEACHING OUR CHILDREN WORTHLESS SHIT MOST OF WHICH THEY WILL NEVER USE
I'M SURPRISED TO LEARN IRELAND HAS A SOCIETY TOO WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION IT WAS AN AMERICAN CULTURAL THING
DELETED
GOOD ADVICE FOR IRELAND NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN US OR EVEN COME CLOSE
THE EMERGENCE OF THOSE DIGITAL IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWING THEMSELVES THEIR BELIEFS OR INDEED THEIR PREJUDICE TO BE CHALLENGED HAS BECOME A MATTER FOR CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION

I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT THE MENTALITY LATELY SEEMS TO BE TO SUPPORT THE SOLVENCY OF YOUR SPECIFIC BRAND OF CULTURAL AND SOCIETAL VALUES WITHOUT REGARD FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO COMPLETELY BYPASS ANYONE THAT DOES NOT AGREE WITH YOU

DURING THE HOLIDAYS IF I WANT TO TALK ABOUT LIBERALS EVENTS I CAN JUST IGNORE MY ENTIRE FAMILY WHICH WILL INHERENTLY DISAGREE WITH ANY VALUES AND JUST USE ANONYMOUS INTERNET DISCUSSIONS TO FULFILL MY NEED TO EXPRESS VIEWS AND PERSPECTIVES THIS IS JUST THE PATH DE LEAST RESISTANCE NO ONE WANTS TO FIGHT SOMEONE WHO THINKS ALL PERSPECTIVES ARE JUST LIKE NFL TEAMS AND WE'RE MERELY ROOTING FOR THE MOST NATIVELY FAMILIAR FRANCHISE

MORE IMPORTANTLY THE REASONS FOR OUR DICHOTOMIZED SOCIETY IS SOMETHING WE WILL BE DISCUSSING FOR YEARS TO COME IN GENERAL I THINK THAT THE EMERGENCE OF THE INTERNET ALLOWS PEOPLE TO REALLY EMBODY AN IDEOLOGY BY PROVIDING COMMUNITIES OF ONLY LIKE MINDED INDIVIDUALS WE EXPECT ANONYMOUS DECAY TO BE A PART OF THE INTERNET BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYONE THAT REALLY ANTICIPATED THE IMPACT ON SOCIETY

WITHOUT SOME LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC RENAISSANCE WHERE EMPIRICISM RESTORES LOGIC AND REASON I THINK WE CONTINUE TO DICHOTOMIZE INTO OBLIVION
REMOVED
I WOULD DISAGREE UNLESS IT'S DONE WELL IF YOU WANT CHILDREN TO LEARN PHILOSOPHY I THINK THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PROPENSITY TOWARDS IT THE SAME AS MATHEMATICS OF COURSE THE MOST COMMON BREAKER WOULD BE A GOOD TEACHER BUT THOSE DON'T COME OFTEN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS IT WOULD BE A MUCH EASIER IDEA IN MY OPINION TO TEACH CHILDREN LOGIC THE BASIS AND THE MISSING KEYSTONE FOR MANY STUDENTS IN REGARDS TO BOTH SUBJECTS THAT IS TO SAY ARGUMENTATION AND A MUCH BIGGER FOCUS ON ABSTRACT THINKING THAN IS PAR FOR THE COURSE A BLARING ISSUE WITH THIS WOULD BE TESTING BUT IMAGINE A CLASSROOM OF STUDENTS DEBATING WHEN UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS OF ACTUALLY MAKING AN ARGUMENT WOW

HOWEVER I AM NOT A CHILD BRAIN DEVELOPMENT EXPERT I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND AT WHAT POINT PRESIDENT HIGGINS IS THINKING ABOUT INTRODUCING THIS SUBJECT INTO A LEARNING HABITS AND AM ALSO NOT A TEACHER SO TAKE WHAT I SAID WITH A GRAIN OF SALT
IRELAND HAS A LOT TO HEAL AND THE FIRST THING SHOULD BE SEPARATING CHURCH AND STATE

ALSO PHILOSOPHY WOULD BE GREAT TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS HOWEVER CURRICULUM ISN'T GOING TO GIVE MUCH MORE THAN ETHICS BASED MODULES

SO BASICALLY WHAT HE'S SAYING IS A BIT REDUNDANT GIVEN THE CONTEXT
I LIKE THE IDEA OF MORE GROUPS TRYING TO BRING PHILOSOPHY INTO THEIR PHILANTHROPY HOWEVER PHILOSOPHY IS MERELY A TOOL HONESTLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE TEACHING KIDS ABOUT PHILOSOPHY I THINK PRAGMATISM IS THE BEST SCHOOL TO START WITH IF YOU TAUGHT KIDS THAT PHILOSOPHY IS A TOOL FOR LOOKING AT THE WORLD AND THAT TOOL SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT FAR MORE THINGS THAN JUST THE RESULTS OF THAT INQUIRY THAT'S A GOOD ENOUGH LESSON TO CHEW ON FOR A LONG LONG TIME SINCE IN REALITY THE BIG LESSON OF PHILOSOPHY IS IN SEEING HOW PEOPLE USE DIFFERENT TOOLS AND FIND DIFFERENT RESULTS
YOU HAVE TO FIND IT ODD THAT THE VERY PEOPLE USING THE PHRASE ARE THE ONES HOS RHETORIC ACTUALLY TRIGGERED THE RE-EMERGENCE OF THE TERM

JUST FROM AN UNBIASED AN UNINVESTED POSITION IT IS VERY POST TRUTH
REMOVED
ALSO STOP CALLING IT SOCIETY CALL IT SOCIETY BASED ON LIES
IN THE CONTEXT OF FIXING THE CULTURE PHILOSOPHY IS WAY TOO BROAD A SUBJECT PERHAPS JUST TEACHING DISCRETE MATHEMATICS IS FAR MORE DIRECT RELEVANT FOR THE PROBLEM AT HAND
I AGREE WITH THIS SPEECH NOT SURE HOW EARLY WE WOULD WANT TO INTRODUCE BASIC PHILOSOPHY TO OUR YOUTH PROBABLY IN 9TH GRADE HERE IN THE STATES WOULD BE APPROPRIATE WHEN YOU BEGIN TO TRULY QUESTION THE CONSTRUCT OF OUR REALITY THE IDEA OF MY CHILDREN READING KANTIAN ETHICS JOHN TWO TREATISES STREET THOMAS AQUINAS NIETZSCHE ETC I LOVE THIS IDEA A GREAT WAY TO HELP SOCIALIZE OUR WORLD AND SCRUB THE INFORMATION THAT ARE MINDS CONSUME AT LIGHTNING SPEED SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE MEDIA TO GUIDE
MY HIGH SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY TEACHER DISCUSSES POST TRUTH SO MUCH NOW LOL
THIS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT IN THE UK TO PREVENT ANOTHER PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN IT HAS EXACTLY ZERO CHANCE OF BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE US
SLIGHTLY TANGENTIAL BUT WAS WORD OF THE YEAR
THIS ARGUMENT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES BUT IT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK

SPAIN HAS HAD A COMPULSORY 2 YEARS OF WORLD PHILOSOPHY AT HIGH-SCHOOL FOR A LONG TIME NOW AND OUR SOCIETY IS ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPT AND IGNORANT IN EUROPE KIDS DON'T NEED TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARISTOTELIC EUDAEMONIA AND STOIC ATARAXIA

PHILOSOPHY HERE IS SIMPLY TAUGHT LIKE HISTORY HIN A AS I LIKE TO CALL IT VOMITIVE WAY I EAST STUDENTS STUDY EVERYTHING THE WEEK BEFORE THE EXAM THEN THEY REGURGITATE IT AND DON'T LEARN ANYTHING

COMPULSORY PHILOSOPHY WON'T MAKE YOUNG PEOPLE MORE INTERESTED IN IT OR MORE EDUCATED OR MORE INTELLIGENT THEY NEED TO SEEK KNOWLEDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THIS IS TO HAVE GOOD EDUCATED PARENTS NOT VOMIT STREET PHILOSOPHY AT A TESTAMENT
IF YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH ARGUING IS OCCURRING IN THIS COMMENT THREAD IT SEEMS LOGICAL THAT PHILOSOPHY IS NOT THE CORE TO GUIDING AWAY FROM A SOCIETY
IF YOU TRY TO FORCE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT A TRUTH THAT IS MORE TRUE TO YOU YOU ARE DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF OPENING THEIR MIND
REMOVED
THIS IS ANECDOTAL BUT TWO OF MY FRIENDS THAT ARE THE WORST ABOUT SHARING BREITBART AND OTHER FAKE NEWS SITES HAVE PHILOSOPHY DEGREES
I COMPLETELY AGREE
REMOVED
REMOVED
PHILOSOPHY IS TOO HIGH LEVEL AN APPROACH I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS BETTER AND THAT PUPILS SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO INTERNALIZE THIS MORE THOROUGHLY IN THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS IT ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF ALREADY BEING IN THE CURRICULUMS AND HAVING TEACHERS IN PLACE
REMOVED
WE DON'T LIVE IN A SOCIETY WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY THAT HAS ESCHEWED REASON AND RATIONALITY IN THE NAME OF FEELINGS AND CODDLING
REMOVED
OF THE US POPULATION BELIEVES IN CLIMATE CHANGE EVEN DESPITE THE MASSIVE PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGNS IN THE MEDIA AGAINST IT THE PROBLEM ISN'T THE PEASANT'S LACK OF CRITICAL REASONING ABILITY IT IS THE BROKEN MECHANISMS OF DEMOCRACY IN A FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY ANY ISSUE WITH A MASSIVE MAJORITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED OR BE SERIOUSLY ON ITS WAY TO BEING FIXED

A COURSE IN KANT ISN'T GOING TO STOP MITCH MCCONNELL TAKING THAT SWEET SWEET OIL MONEY IN FAVOR OF NOT DOOMING THE HUMAN SPECIES

AS FOR THE REST OF HIS ARGUMENT PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL OPINIONS ARE NOT THE RESULT OF CRITICAL THINKING REGARDING THE WORLD THEY ARE EXPRESSIONS OF BELIEF SYSTEMS THE SAME WAY CONSERVATIVE ONES ARE

DESPITE ALL THAT A BIT OF PHILOSOPHY COULDN'T HURT
REMOVED
TEACH ISN'T EXACTLY AN OPTION WHEN THE UNWILLINGNESS TO LEARN IS THE CORE OF THE PROBLEM
THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT REASONS TO TEACH MORE PHILOSOPHY PARTICULARLY AT HIGH SCHOOL BUT THIS REASON HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST
I THINK SOMETIMES THAT TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IS THE MOST DANGEROUS THING YOU CAN DO I FEEL LIKE ANYONE THAT THINKS AS MUCH AS ME MUST BOARDER ON NIHILIST AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE WANT FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION BECAUSE WHILE I AM NOT A MALICIOUS SOCIOPATH AND DON'T THINK I EVER WILL BE I THINK MANY WOULD TAKE UP THE POST IF SO EXPOSED TO PHILOSOPHY
REMOVED
OH YEAH TEACH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT VACCINES ARE BAD FOR YOU AND DONALD TRUMP ISN'T A PSYCHOPATH TO BE SKEPTICS TEACH THEM ABOUT THE APPEAL TO AUTHORITY AND SHIT LIKE THAT SO THEY HAVE MORE FUEL TO KEEP THEM IN DENIAL

NO TEACH THEM SCIENCE AND SHIT SO THEY CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THINGS THAT ARE PROBABLY TRUE AND PROBABLY NOT TRUE LEAVE PHILOSOPHY TO THE INTELLECTUALS WHO CAN USE IT PROPERLY
REMOVED
REMOVED
IF PINOCCHIO SAID MY NOSE WILL GROW IT WOULDN'T BE A LIE AND HIS NOSE WOULD NOT GROW BECAUSE OF THAT STATEMENT

THAT STATEMENT IS TRUTHFUL BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO TELL THE TRUTH ALWAYS AND FOREVER
IT'S SO WEIRD LOGIC WORKS FINE FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE SET OF ALL SETS THAT DON'T CONTAIN THEMSELVES WHICH COMPLETELY BREAKS IT
ISNT THE HERE PROBLEM THAT WE EQUATE A FALSE PREDICTION WITH A LIE
YOU'RE MISREPRESENTING THE PARADOX THE CORRECT PARADOXICAL STATEMENT IS MY NOSE WILL GROW NOW

IT'S A GENUINE PARADOX WITHOUT A SOLUTION MORE HERE
WHAT I HATE ABOUT PARADOXES IS THAT THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO ONLY TAKE PLACE IN IMPOSSIBLE SCENARIOS LIKE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE HITS AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO HAVE AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT

ARE THERE ANY PARADOXES THAT APPEAR IN REALISTIC CONDITIONS
THE PINOCCHIO PARADOX SHOULD NOT BE A PARADOX BECAUSE I BELIEVE HIS NOSE GROWS OR DOESN T BASED ON INTENT AS OPPOSED TO GROWING NOT BASED ON ACTUAL TRUTH PINOCCHIO S NOSE DOES NOT DIVULGE INFORMATION PAGE DOES NOT KNOW ALREADY

FOR EXAMPLE PAGE IS GOING TO GUESS HOW MANY CANDIES ARE IN A JAR PAGE DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY CANDIES ARE IN THAT JAR WOULD EVERY GUESS THEN MAKE HIS NOSE GROW IT DEPENDS HOW IS HE GUESSING STATING HIS GUESS IS HE GUESSING WITH INTENT ON DECEIVING SOMEONE ELSE INTO BELIEVING HE REALLY KNOW THE NUMBER OF CANDIES IF SO THEN EVERY GUESS WRONG OR RIGHT WOULD RESULT IN HIS NOSE GROWING BECAUSE IT IS HIS INTENT TO DECEIVE HE WOULD BE STATING SOMETHING AS IF IT WERE A FACT WITH THE INTENT ON MAKING SOMEONE ELSE BELIEVE THERE IS TRUTH BEHIND A STATEMENT HE BELIEVES COULD BE FALSE ON THE OTHER HAND IF HE ISN T TRYING TO DECEIVE ANYONE AND IS JUST MAKING A GUESS THEN HIS NOSE SHOULDN T GROW FOR ANY GUESS RIGHT OR WRONG

ANOTHER EXAMPLE PAGE IS GOING THROUGH SOME SOUL SEARCHING AND IS TRYING TO FIND OUT IF THERE REALLY IS A GOD OR NOT SO HE SAYS THERE IS A GOD NOW HERE AGAIN PAGE IS JUST GUESSING WHETHER THERE IS A GOD OR NOT ISN T GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT HIS NOSE GROWS REGARDLESS OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD IF HIS INTENT IS TO PRETEND LIKE HE BELIEVES THERE IS A GOD BUT HE REALLY DOESN T THEN HIS NOSE SHOULD GROW AND VICE VERSA

BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PARADOX PAGE SAYS MY NOSE WILL GROW NOW WHAT IS HIS REASON BEHIND SAYING THIS WHAT S HIS INTENT IS HIS TRUEST INTENT TO DECEIVE THEN IT WILL GROW EVEN IF IT VALIDATES HIS STATEMENT BECAUSE PAGE WAS TRYING TO LIE WAS HIS TRUEST INTENT TO TELL THE TRUTH BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT REALLY WOULD GROW AFTER THAT STATEMENT THEN IT WON T GROW HIS NOSE IS NOT A TRUTH INDICATOR IT S A LIE EXPOSER STATING SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE TO BE TRUE BUT ISN T ISN T A LIE IT S JUST AN INCORRECT ANSWER IF I ANSWERED A MATH QUESTION INCORRECTLY ON A TEST I DIDN T LIE I WAS JUST WRONG

NOW IF I M WRONG WHICH HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPEN ABOUT THIS INTENT IDEA AND HIS NOSE GROWS DOESN T BASED ON ACTUAL TRUTH THEN IT S POSSIBLY THE GREATEST GIFT OF ALL TIME PAGE COULD STATE ANYTHING AS FACT AND BASED ON HIS NOSE GROWING NOT KNOW THE TRUTH OF ANYTHING EVER BY PROCESS OF ELIMINATION HE COULD KNOW THE DAY HE WILL DIE AND WHY THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE THE MEANING OF LIFE NEXT WEEK S LOTTO NUMBERS HE WOULD BE A LIVING GRAYS SPORTS ALMANAC NOW IF HIS NOSE WAS BESTOWED WITH THIS TYPE OF POWER THEN SURE THERE S A PINOCCHIO PARADOX WHERE YOU CAN DEBATE FOREVER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE SAID MY NOSE WILL GROW NOW BUT I THINK THE MUCH MORE INTERESTING THING IS NOW PAGE IS BASICALLY OMNIPOTENT AND THAT S A MUCH COOLER TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION THAN WHETHER OR NOT HIS NOSE WOULD GROW

IT IS SIMPLE INTENT WHAT IS INTENT

WHETHER THE NOSE GROWS IN THE FUTURE OR NOT IS NOT PREDICATED ON JUST A STATEMENT IN A VACUUM BUT THE ACTOR'S INTENT

IS THE ACTOR'S STATEMENT MEANT TO

A CONVEY WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE TRUE
B CONVEY FALSE INFORMATION IN ORDER TO DECEIVE

IF THE REASON IS A THEN THE NOSE DOES NOT GROW IT DOES NOT MEAN HE WAS LYING IT MEANS HE WAS INCORRECT IN HIS ASSESSMENT HE MAY BE SURPRISED BY THE EVENT BUT THERE IS NO PARADOX

IF THE REASON WAS B THEN THE NOSE DOES GROW IT DOES NOT MEAN HE WAS BEING TRUTHFUL IT MEANS HE WAS INCORRECT IN HIS ASSESSMENT HE MAY BE SURPRISED BY THE EVENT BUT THERE IS NO PARADOX





THE QUESTION IS WHETHER LIES DEPEND MORE ON BEING A STATEMENT CONTRARY TO A SINCERE BELIEF OR IF IT'S A LIE BY BEING A CONTRADICTION OF A STATEMENT OF FACT

IF NOSE GROWS BASED ON ANY STATEMENT OF FACT THAT HE IS CONTRADICTING THE APPLICATIONS WOULD BE INNUMERABLE JUST PICTURE HIM SAYING THINGS LIKE THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF THE HIGGS BOSON IS GREATER THAN GEV AND SEEING IF HIS NOSE ELONGATES OR NOT
BUT BUT WHAT IF HE SAID IT AGAIN
THIS CASE APPLIES TO A FANTASY STORY HOWEVER DOES ANYONE KNOW ANY REAL APPLICATIONS OF THIS CONUNDRUM
THE JOKER SEEMS AN APT EXAMPLE FOR CONCEPTS IN UTILITARIANISM AS WELL THE JOKER MIGHT IN FACT BE A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A UTILITY MONSTER

CONSIDER ANOTHER UTILITARIAN BATMAN SCENARIO

LET'S ASSUME THAT THE JOKER CAN SOMEHOW DEMONSTRATE TO BATMAN THAT THE RELATIVE ENJOYMENT HE RECEIVES FROM KILLING IS GREATER THAN THE PAIN HIS VICTIMS EXPERIENCE FROM BEING KILLED IN FACT THERE IS SOME JUSTIFICATION TO THAT CLAIM CONSIDERING HOW THE JOKER KILLS PEOPLE THROUGH THE USE OF DRUGS HIS VICTIMS ARE NOT ONLY WILLING TO DIE BUT POSITIVELY GIDDY ABOUT IT NOT ONLY ARE THEY HAPPY TO DIE BUT THE JOKER IS HAPPY TO KILL THEM EVERYONE'S NET HAPPINESS IS INCREASED AND IF YOU WANT TO CLAIM THE VICTIMS ARE STILL SUFFERING INSTEAD ASSUME THE JOKER JUST REALLY LIKES KILLING PEOPLE AND HAS A GREATER CAPACITY FOR ENJOYMENT THAN HIS VICTIM'S CAPACITY FOR SUFFERING

BY CONTRAST IF BATMAN EVER STOPPED THE JOKER FROM EVER KILLING ANYONE AGAIN THAT WOULD REDUCE THE NET HAPPINESS AND IT WOULD PREVENT HIS FUTURE VICTIMS FROM ENJOYING THEIR DEATHS INSTEAD DOOMING THEM TO SOME OTHER KIND OF DEATH THEY WOULD SUFFER NET HAPPINESS IS DECREASED

SO AFTER ALL CONSIDERING THAT TRANSACTION IT WOULD BE WRONG FOR BATMAN TO PREVENT THE JOKER FROM KILLING IF BATMAN WERE A TRUE UTILITARIAN JOKER COULD MANAGE TO CONVINCE HIM TO PERMIT AS MANY MURDERS AS MAKES THE JOKER HAPPY
RULE UTILITARIANISM SEEMS PRETTY GOOD TO ME SO LONG AS THE SUBJECT CAN DEFINE A CLEAR MAJORITY BUT WHAT ABOUT A SCENARIO WHERE THE POPULATION IS TRULY SPLIT ON AN ISSUE

IF THE PEOPLE WERE COMPLETELY SPLIT ON SAY GAY MARRIAGE HOW CAN WE USE THIS PHILOSOPHY TO DECIDE WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHAT ABOUT AGAINST FOR IS THE RIGHT JUST BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SWAYED TO IT
IMHO UTILITARIANISM VIRTUE ETHICS AND DEONTOLOGY THE THREE PILLARS ALL ARE VERY UNILATERAL AND FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR A LOT OF CASES

A GOOD NORMATIVE ETHICAL THEORY HAS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL THESE FACTORS

CONSEQUENCE
DUTY
INTENTION
SELF-INTEREST

WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THESE BY SOME THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS WITH THE TROLLEY PROBLEM WHILE IT SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO PULL THE LEVER AND KILL TO SAVE IT GETS A LOT MORE CONTROVERSIAL WHEN WE TWEAK THE SITUATION A BIT IF WE NEED TO PUSH THE FAT MAN THEN DUTY HAS COME INTO PLAY IF WE NEED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN OUR LOVER PARENTS AND A FEW STRANGERS THEN SELF-INTEREST IS CONSIDERED WHAT ABOUT BETWEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND COMMONERS
THANK YOU NEEDED THIS
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT LOGICAL PLURALISM IF YOU'RE NOT A FAN WHAT LOGICAL SYSTEM DO YOU LIKE

HOW DO HANDLE INCOMPLETENESS THEOREMS I'VE OFTEN HEARD IT PUT AS A DILEMMA BETWEEN EITHER STARTING WITH A STRONG LOGIC OR ACCEPTING A MATHEMATICS WITH FAR MORE UNDECIDABLE THAN WE'D TYPICALLY LIKE ASSUMING THAT'S APT IT MIGHT NOT BE I'M NOT A MATHEMATICIAN WHICH HORN DO THEY SETTLE ON OF THE DILEMMA

I SEEM TO RECALL A FAMOUS FREGE SCHOLAR GETTING INVOLVED IN CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISM BECAUSE OF NOTORIOUS RACISM AMONG OTHER THINGS AND WHILE I'M NOT SURE I'D GO THAT FAR DO YOU SEE ANY REASON TO SORT OF COME BACK DOWN AND PUT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AS INTERESTING AS CANTOR'S PROOF MAY BE ONE OF THE FEARS I HAVE ABOUT GOING INTO PHILOSOPHY IS THAT I WON'T BE HELPING ANYBODY VERY MUCH THIS FEELS LIKE MORE OF AN ISSUE WITH LOGIC AND PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS THAN OTHER FIELDS OF PHILOSOPHY EAST G VALUE THEORY SOCIALLY RELEVANT PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE ETC WHILE I QUITE OFTEN FIND MYSELF GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE MATERIAL OF DIFFERENT FIELDS OUT OF INTEREST I HAVE A HARD TIME CONVINCING MYSELF IT WOULD BE GOOD TO DO PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS FULL TIME
HEY DR COOK

I HAVE RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM A SCHOOL IN MINNESOTA WITH A DEGREE IN MATHEMATICS AND PHILOSOPHY I GOT INTO THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS DURING MY UNDERGRADUATE AND ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF IT I STUDIED ABOUT HOW WE CAN CREATE BEING THROUGH MATHEMATICS GEOMETRICAL AND ALGEBRAIC AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF IT HOWEVER I AM CURRENTLY STUDYING MATHEMATICS AT ANOTHER MIDWEST UNIVERSITY FOR MY GRADUATE DEGREE MY QUESTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS

HOW DO WE INCREASE THE IMAGE OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS IN MATH AND PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENTS IN THE MIDWEST IT SEEMS TO BE VERY LACKING IN MINNESOTA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA I JUST FIND IT FRUSTRATING TO DO ANY RESEARCH BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY LONELY ISLAND IN THE MIDWEST IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS

ALSO I WANTED TO ASK IF IT IS NORMAL TO GET A GRADUATE DEGREE IN MATHEMATICS AND THEN MOVE OVER TO THE FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS I KNOW A LOT OF MATHEMATICIANS HAVE DONE THIS AND IT MAY BE A GOOD OPTION IN THE FUTURE IF I DON'T WANT TO STICK WITH PURE MATHEMATICS

ANYWAYS

BEST
HI I HAVE RECENTLY GOTTEN INTERESTED IN INTUITIVE LOGICS MATHEMATICS AND I AM WONDERING WHY DOESN'T IT HAVE A WIDER ACCEPTANCE I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE LIKE TO USE THE LAW OF EXCLUDED MIDDLE BUT WHY ISN'T THIS VIEW ON WHAT MATHEMATICS REALLY ARE OR AT LEAST WHAT QUESTIONS IT BRINGS UP MORE WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED
I RECENTLY READ SAMPHIRES BOOK THINKING ABOUT MATHEMATICS AND IT IS BRIEFLY MENTIONED THAT FREGE AND RUSSELL BOTH AGREED THAT MATHEMATICS AS WE USE IT IS MADE BY US HUMANS BUT FROM READING A LOT OF RUSSELL I HAVE NEVER COME ACROSS THIS EXPLICITLY DO YOU HAVE ANY POINTER TO WHERE THEY ACTUALLY SAY THIS OR HAVE I MISUNDERSTOOD SOMETHING
THANKS GLAD TO SEE IT IS NOT ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THESE THINGS
HELLO DR COOK
MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS HOW WOULD ONE GO ABOUT SOLVING PARADOXES WITHIN RELIGION SPECIFICALLY MINE CHRISTIANITY THERES LOTS OF PARADOXES IN THAT RELIGION

CHRISTIANITY CLAIMS THAT JESUS WAS HUMAN AND GOD DIVINE
JESUS HAD HIS OWN LITERARY PARADOXES TOO THE FIRST SHALL BE LAST AND THE LAST FIRST AND TO SAVE YOUR LIFE IS TO LOSE IT AND TO LOSE YOUR LIFE FOR MY SAKE IS TO SAVE IT

IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO WITH THESE I KNOW AS FAR AS THE LITERAL ONES BIBLE SCHOLARS USE HERMENEUTICS TO ANSWER THESE RHETORICAL PUZZLES

BUT AS FAR AS THE HUMAN AND DIVINE PARADOX AS WELL AS MANY OTHER THEOLOGICAL PARADOXES CAN ANYTHING BE DONE TO WORK THROUGH THEM OR DO THEY JUST REMAIN A MYSTERY


ALSO I AM CURRENTLY TAKING AN INTRODUCTORY AESTHETICS COURSE AT MY SCHOOL I WOULD SAY COMICS ARE ART BUT COULD A COMIC EVER BE CONSIDERED HIGH ART HIGH ART MEANING VIEWED AS ONE OF THE GREAT EST WORKS OF ART


THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS AFTER HEARING ABOUT THE THINGS YOU WORK ON IN YOUR VIDEO INTERVIEW I DON'T THINK I HAVE THE TYPE OF BRAIN OR EVEN THE ABILITY TO CONTEMPLATE THINGS LIKE INFINITY AND THE PARADOXES YOU DEAL WITH SO I AM VERY MUCH IN AWE OF YOUR ABILITY TO DO SO YOU SEEM LIKE A VERY INTELLIGENT PHILOSOPHER AND WOULD MAKE FOR A GOOD PROFESSOR
THUS I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THAT IS COMICS THAT BREAK THESE FORMAL RULES OR STORYTELLING NORMS IN VARIOUS WAYS

I LOVE COMICS LIKE THIS IN PARTICULAR YOU'VE REMINDED ME OF ONE OF MY FAVORITES A GREYSHIRT STORY BY ALAN MOORE AND RICK VEITCH EACH PAGE IS A STACK OF PANELS WITH EACH PANEL TELLING THE STORY OF THE RESIDENTS OF THAT RESPECTIVE FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING OVER DIFFERENT ERAS OF TIME I DON'T HAVE MY BOOKS AT WORK WITH ME TO GIVE A BETTER CITATION IT AMAZED ME BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST STORY I'D EVER SEEN THAT COULD IN A LITERAL SENSE ONLY BE TOLD THROUGH THE MEDIUM ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THIS ONE AND IF SO DO YOU HAVE ANY INTERESTING PHILOSOPHICAL INSIGHTS ABOUT IT I HAVE NO BACKGROUND IN PHILOSOPHY FOR CONTEXT

IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT ONE THEN MY BACKUP QUESTION IS HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET ASKED ABOUT DEADPOOL
WHAT HAVE YOU WRITTEN ON COMICS HOW FAR BACK DO YOU GO HISTORICALLY HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ICONOGRAPHY
PROFESSOR COOK

THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS AMA I VE READ SOME OF YOUR ARTICLES ON PARADOXES AND THINK THEY ARE EXCELLENT IN PARTICULAR YOUR ARTICLES ON THE ALGORITHMIC PARADOX AND THE PABLO PARADOX LINKED ABOVE ARE THE MOST CLEAR CONCISE EXPOSITIONS ON THIS TOPIC I VE READ

LIKE YOU I AM ALSO FASCINATED WITH SEMANTICAL PARADOXES OVER THIS PAST YEAR I VE DEVELOPED AN OUTLINE FOR A TRUTH THEORY IN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE SHED LIGHT ON THESE PARADOXES HERE IS A VERY BRIEF SUMMARY

PROPOSITIONS ARE USED AS THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH BEARERS SENTENCES REFER TO POINT TO PROPOSITIONS BUT THEY ARE NOT INTRINSICALLY TRUE OR FALSE

2 A PROPOSITION IS THE CONNECTION OF A PREDICATE TO A SUBJECT DEFINITION SIMILAR TO THE ONE GIVEN USED BY LEIBNIZ

ALL SUBJECTS OBJECTS HAVE A COLLECTION OF PROPERTIES

A PROPOSITION IS TRUE IF ITS SUBJECT S HAS AS A PROPERTY THE PROPERTY CLAIMED BY THE PREDICATE

OBJECTS ARE THE URELEMENTS IN THIS THEORY ALL PROPOSITIONS MUST HAVE WELL DEFINED ORDINAL RANK I EAST ALL PROPOSITIONS ARE WELL-FOUNDED THEY MUST BE CONSTRUCTED BY CONNECTING A PREDICATE TO AN REGLEMENT OR ANOTHER WELL-FOUNDED PROPOSITION MEANING ALL WELL-FOUNDED PROPOSITIONS MUST ULTIMATELY HAVE THEIR COMPLETE FOUNDATIONS IN URELEMENTS

PROPOSITIONS WHICH ARE NOT WELL-FOUNDED DO NOT HAVE ACTUAL ONTOLOGICAL EXISTENCE OR AT MINIMUM ARE IN A DIFFERENT ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY AS WELL-FOUNDED PROPOSITIONS JUST AS WE CAN REFER TO MATHEMATICAL ENTITIES THAT DO NOT EXIST WITH WORDS AND SYNTAX EAST G IF X MATHEMATICIANS WOULD SAY THERE IS NO SUCH X WE CAN WITH OUR SENTENCES REFER TO PROPOSITIONS WHICH DO NOT EXIST

THE CONCLUSION OF THIS SYSTEM IS THAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE LIAR SENTENCE AND THE PABLO PARADOX IS THAT THEY USE SENTENCES WHICH REFER TO PROPOSITIONS WHICH ARE NOT WELL-FOUNDED THEY ARE SENTENCES OR SYNTAX OBJECTS THAT REFER TO SENTENCES BUT NOT TO ANY WELL-FOUNDED PROPOSITION SENTENCES ARE NOT FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH BEARERS OR SEMANTICAL OBJECTS AND SO THEY MUST REFERENCE OR BE PLUGGED IN TO WELL-FOUNDED PROPOSITIONS TO TRANSMIT MEANING TRUTH JUST AS CONSIDERING X WHEN X TO BE IN THE SAME ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY AS THE REAL NUMBERS LEADS TO CONTRADICTIONS SO TOO DOES CONSIDERING THE LIAR SENTENCE AS REFERENCING A WELL-FOUNDED PROPOSITION LEAD TO CONTRADICTIONS

SO FOR MY QUESTION WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY OTHER ATTEMPTS OF THIS KIND OR KNOW OF ANY GOOD RESOURCES TO LOOK INTO FOR OTHER WORK ON THIS APPROACH THANKS FOR ANY FEEDBACK

I'M A STUDENT INTERESTED IN FORMAL MODELS OF RATIONALITY CURRENTLY APPLYING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO TO A PHILOSOPHY GRADUATE SCHOOL WITH A STRONG BASIS IN FORMAL EPISTEMOLOGY OR A COMPUTER SCIENCE GRADUATE SCHOOL
GOOD DAY REDDIN AND DR COOK

FOR MY GRADUATE THESIS I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS MATHEMATICS AS AN AESTETHIC OBJECT AS DESCRIBED BY FREDERICK SCHILLER NAMELY MATHEMATICS HAS BOTH COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL SENSUAL ASPECTS

DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR RECOMMENDED READINGS ON HOW MATHEMATICS IS GROUNDED IN OUR PHYSICAL SENSUOUS EXISTENCE

REGARDS
THIS IS WHY THE MINIMALISM MOVEMENT HAS BEEN TAKING OFFICIAL PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF BEING A PRISONER TO CONSUMERISM AND CONSTANTLY OVERWHELMED BY STUFF
I'M WORRIED THAT I M BECOMING SATURATED WITH INFORMATION AND THAT I LIKE IT
WE SEEM TO HAVE THIS WEIRD COMPULSION TO WANT STUFF TO BUY STUFF BECAUSE IT BRINGS TEMPORARY HAPPINESS BUT IT WEARS OFF QUICK AND YOU ARE LEFT WITH JUNK I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS A CAUSE OF ADVERTISING OR JUST A GENERAL EMPTINESS IN OUR LIVES THAT WE NEED TO FILL THE MODERN WORLD IN THE WEST SEEMS TO BE FAKE WE LIVE IN A WORLD OF ADVERTISING EVEN THE INTERNET IS A GIANT AND SOCIAL MEDIA THE NEW FRONTIER IS JUST A GIANT ADVERTISING LANDSCAPE THIS MUST BE ALTERING OUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND IN SOME WAY AS WE ALL IDENTIFY AND HAVE STRONG CONNECTIONS WITH CONSUMER PRODUCTS
WATCH V MAGAN
I AGREE AND I THINK A FEW THINGS HAVE ALSO COME TOGETHER MARKETING HAS BECOME A TRUE SCIENCE THERE IS MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR MARKETING IE INTERNET AND IT'S THE SECOND OR THIRD GENERATION OF EASY CREDIT NO ONE SAVES UP FOR ANYTHING ANYMORE

THE CONCLUDING PARAGRAPH HERE POINTS TO SOMETHING INTERESTING

CERTAINLY NO MEANS NO AND ONLY YES MEANS YES BUT AS WE VE SEEN ISSUES OF CONSENT AND NONCONSENSUAL SEX ARE MORE COMPLICATED IN ADDITION TO HOLDING INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE WE MUST CONSIDER THE CULTURAL ETHOS IN WHICH LACK OF CONSENT IS VALORIZED AND RAPE HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO NONCONSENSUAL SEX AND WHERE TALK OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IS CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE BOYS WILL BE BOYS AND LOCKER ROOM TALK BY THOSE WHO WILL LEAD THIS COUNTRY THE NEED TO BE VIGILANT IS EVEN MORE URGENT NOW

WE SEEM TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF A REGRESSIVE POLITICAL SWING IN THE U SOUTH HISTORICALLY I ASSUME MEN GOT AWAY WITH MORE RAPE WE SAW PROGRESS OVER THE LAST CENTURY BUT NOW THAT PROGRESS IS BEING THREATENED BULLYING RACIST STATEMENTS AND OTHER UGLY THINGS THAT MAINSTREAM CULTURE HAS BEEN FIGHTING LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE REALLY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS FIGHT HAVE MADE A RESURGENCE

THERE'S A DARKER SIDE TO OUR PSYCHES THAT LIKES THE IDEA OF THE TABOO COMING OUT IN THE OPEN BUT LIKE THE ARTICLE SAYS WE HAVE TO REMAIN VIGILANT AGAINST ENABLING ABUSERS

GOOD ARTICLE THOUGH LONG-WINDED
I STRONGLY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR'S CONTENTION THAT THE LEGALISTIC FIFTY SHADES OF GREY MODEL OF CONSENT FAILS TO CAPTURE THE COMPLEXITIES OF SEX AS A DYNAMIC INTERACTION THE LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THIS COMPLEXITY WHICH U APPROVINGLY CITES I AGREE WITH AS WELL AS A WHITE MAN THOUGH I FEEL THE NEED TO PROTEST UNEQUIVOCAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE SACRED ORTHODOXY OF DON'T BLAME THE VICTIM

I WENT TO A SCHOOL WITH A HUGE FRATERNITY SCENE AND I WAS CONSISTENTLY A BIT RESENTFUL AT HOW MUCH SOCIAL PRESTIGE WAS AWARDED TO FRATERNITY BROTHERS BY WOMEN ON CAMPUS FRATERNITY PARTIES DID TO ME HAVE A VIBE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT WAS A BIG PROBLEM BESIDES THE FACT THAT BINGE DRINKING PRECEDED OF COURSE BY WAS THE ACTIVITY OF CHOICE THESE WERE LITERALLY SPACES FILLED BY MEN WITH A BOUNCER AT THE DOOR WHOSE MAIN GOAL WAS TO KEEP THE RATIO INSIDE AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE WANT TO GET INTO A FRAT BETTER MAKE SURE YOUR POSSE IS AT LEAST FEMALE IT WAS PRETTY MUCH AN OPEN SECRET THAT THE MAIN REASON TO PLEDGE A FRAT WAS TO GET LAID I WAS FRIENDLY WITH THE DIRECTOR OF FRATERNITY AFFAIRS WHOSE JOB SEEMED TO MOSTLY CONSIST IN SHIELDING THE SCHOOL FROM LIABILITY STEMMING FROM THE FRATS FREQUENT SHENANIGANS AND HE TOLD ME THAT PLENTY OF WOMEN STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL TOLD HIM THAT THEY WOULD ONLY EVER HOOK UP WITH WITH FRATERNITY BROTHERS THIS WAS TOTALLY CONSISTENT WITH MY EXPERIENCE THAT WOMEN ON CAMPUS WERE QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TRYING THEIR LUCK IN THESE UNSAFE SPACES WHERE ALCOHOL AND SECRECY MADE ISSUES OF PROOF AND CONSENT HOPELESSLY FOGGY

IF I CAN MUSTER A BIT OF SUPPORT FOR MY HERE IS MARTHA NUSSBAUM ADVISING WOMEN IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT TO STAY OUT OF SPACES WHERE THERE IS NO SAFE RECOURSE IN THE CASE OF RAPE
ONLY SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT MORE IMPORTANTLY NO OTHER NAME FOR NONCONSENSUAL SEX CAN EQUATE TO THE RESULTANT TORN PSYCHICS OF ALL INVOLVED
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT I THINK OF ELIMINATING THE NOUN SEX FROM A PHRASE THAT EXPLICITLY RELIES ON IT TO TRANSFER MEANING BUT IT IS VITAL FOR US TO MAINTAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CLASS CONFLICT IN THIS HAPPENING OF HUMANS

THERE IS NO DEEPER LEVEL OF INTIMACY THAN THAT WHICH PERTAINS TO WHAT IS INSIDE YOUR FLESH PER SAY I HOPE THAT CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT REMEMBERS THIS IN A WORLD QUICKLY TURNING MORE VIOLENT
TL W
IS KNOWLEDGE THE SAME AS JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO JENNIFER NAGEL UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO DISCUSSES A GETTER CASE A SCENARIO IN WHICH SOMEONE HAS JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF BUT NOT KNOWLEDGE WE LL LOOK AT A GETTER CASE FROM EDMUND GETTER S FAMOUS PAPER ON THIS TOPIC AND A STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR CASE FROM 8TH CENTURY CLASSICAL INDIAN PHILOSOPHY

THANKS FOR WATCHING IF YOU LIKE OUR VIDEOS PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL

WIPHI
GETTER CASES ARE SUPPOSED TO SHOW THAT ATB IS NOT SUFFICIENT BUT ALL THEY REALLY DO IS RETURN US TO THE TRADITIONAL QUESTION OF WHETHER ATB JUSTIFICATION IN PARTICULAR IS ATTAINABLE TO SHOW THAT ATB IS NOT SUFFICIENT GETTER CASES WOULD HAVE TO WORK FOR SUFFICIENTLY STRONG FORMS OF JUSTIFICATION BUT THEY FAIL TO DO SO THE REAL PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT SUFFICIENTLY STRONG FORMS OF JUSTIFICATION ARE HARD TO ATTAIN GETTER CASES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN CONVOLUTED WAYS OF REINTRODUCING PHILOSOPHICAL SKEPTICISM WITH REGARD TO JUSTIFICATION WE DIDN'T NEED GETTER FOR THAT WE'VE HAD SEXTUS EMPIRICS AND FRIENDS FOR MANY CENTURIES
THIS MIGHT BE GOOD FOR SOMEONE ASKING PHILOSOPHY TO BE EXPLAINED ON R EXPLAINLIKEIMFIVE
LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND SINCE THE ARTICLE MENTIONS NOTHING ON MOTIVE

UNDER DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE THINGS ARE INDIVIDUALLY NECESSARY AND JOINTLY SUFFICIENT TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE

THE KNOWLEDGE CLAIM MUST BE TRUE IT'S NOT KNOWLEDGE IF IT'S WRONG OBVIOUSLY
2 THE KNOWLEDGE CLAIM MUST HAVE CONVICTION IT'S NOT KNOWLEDGE IF YOU'RE UNSURE
THE KNOWLEDGE CLAIM MUST BE JUSTIFIED OTHERWISE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT YOUR TRUTH

SO THEY'RE EACH NEEDED TO FORM KNOWLEDGE AND NO OTHER CLAUSES ARE NECESSARY TO FORM KNOWLEDGE UNDER THEORY GETTER SHOWED THAT THESE CLAUSES ALONE WERE NOT ENOUGH TO SHOW KNOWLEDGE LEADING TO MANY FOUNDATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE WHERE THE CLAIM IS SELF EVIDENT NEEDING NO JUSTIFICATION AND WE CAN BASE OUR KNOWLEDGE FROM THIS DESCARTES FAMOUSLY DID THIS THROUGH THE COGITO I THINK THEREFORE I AM IF HE DIDN'T EXIST DESCARTES WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO THINK IT'S NECESSARILY TRUE AND NEEDS NO FURTHER JUSTIFICATION SO THIS CAN FORM THE JUSTIFICATION FOR OUR OTHER BELIEFS

TL R IT'S ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF BELIEFS AND HOW WE REACH THEM LOGICALLY WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT IT BEING FALSE
THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE ONE OF TIME WHAT IS STRIKING ABOUT EACH OF THE GETTER PROBLEMS USED IN THE ARTICLE IS THAT THEY DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT STATIC IT IS DYNAMIC IT IS EVER-CHANGING BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A WORLD THAT IS ITSELF EVER-CHANGING

IN THE FIRST PROBLEM THE JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF OF ONE STATIC MOMENT IS ERRONEOUSLY ASSUMED TO BE IDENTICAL TO THE JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF OF ANOTHER STATIC MOMENT THE FIRST MOMENT OCCURS WHEN I PLACE THE BOTTLES OF NEWCASTLE BROWN IN THE FRIDGE AT THAT EXACT STATIC MOMENT I HAVE A JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF THAT THERE ARE 2 BOTTLES OF NEWCASTLE BROWN IN MY FRIDGE BEYOND THAT MOMENT THE JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF LOSES IT'S RELEVANCE AND BECOMES A PLACE-HOLDER IT CHANGES FROM JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF INTO ASSUMPTION AND CAN ONLY BE CALLED JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF IN ANY OTHER STATIC MOMENT IF IT HAS ALSO BEEN VERIFIED

AT BEST THE GETTER PROBLEM ILLUSTRATES THAT WHAT WE CALL KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE IMPERFECT AT BEST SINCE IT WILL BE LIMITED TO WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF KNOWING IN ANY GIVEN STATIC MOMENT

BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE A SURPRISE TO ANYONE COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE IS RESERVED FOR IMAGINARY BEINGS CAPABLE OF OMNISCIENCE NO HUMAN BEING WILL EVER HAVE THAT CAPACITY
SO KNOWLEDGE CAN BE WRONG THAT SEEMS RIGHT TO ME
JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF ISN'T A DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE ITS AN ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE
KNOWLEDGE CAN'T APPLY TO THE FUTURE THE FIRST CASE IS ESSENTIALLY PREDICTING THE FUTURE THAT THE ALE WILL STILL BE THERE THE KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THE ALE WAS THERE BUT ONCE IT LEAVES SIGHT IT IS NO LONGER KNOWLEDGE IF IT IS STILL THERE
THIS SIMPLY COMES DOWN TO A DEFINITION OF JUSTIFIED

WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE JUSTIFIED

WHY IS BELIEVING THE BEERS I PUT IN THE FRIDGE LAST NIGHT ARE STILL THERE AFTER I COME HOME FROM WORK JUSTIFIED

WHY IS BELIEVING A MALE LOOKING PERSON SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM CHAIR IS MY HUSBAND JUSTIFIED



I CONSIDER THIS KIND OF PHILOSOPHY SEMATIC MASTURBATION I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT THE PROBLEM IS IN USING WORDS TO DEFINE OTHER WORDS AND THEN COMING UP WITH PUZZLES TO SHOW THAT THEY COULD THEORETICALLY BE WRONG OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T KNOW EVERY POSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT GOOD ENOUGH WORKS MOST OF THE TIME AND OUR LANGUAGE ASSUMES THIS SAME
SOPHISTRY

IF YOUR HOME CAN BE BURGLED AND YOUR BREW REPLACED WITHOUT YOU KNOWING IT YOUR BELIEF THAT YOUR ORIGINAL BEER IS WAITING FOR YOU AFTER AN ABSENCE IS UNJUSTIFIED

THIS IS A SEMANTIC TRICK AS HOARY AS THE WHERE DID THE OTHER DOLLAR GO WORD PROBLEM
HEADLINE QUIBBLE GETTER DID NOT PRESENT HIS COUNTEREXAMPLES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW THINGS HE ACCEPTED THE INTUITION THAT WE KNOW TONS OF THINGS HE JUST THOUGHT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH DEFINING EXACTLY WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP CONSISTED OF
BUT IF YOU BUY BEER PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE AND LEAVE YOU CAN'T KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT THERE IS BEER IN YOUR FRIDGE YOU CAN ONLY THINK THERE IS AND HAVE LOGIC POINT TO THERE BEING A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT
THIS ONE SIMPLE TRICK

CLICKBAIT TITLES ARE THE WORST
PERTINENT SCENE FROM MEN IN BLACK

I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE CONTROVERSY HERE EACH SITUATION PRESENTED IN THE PAPER CAN BE BOILED DOWN TO AN UNSOUND SOMETIMES INVALID AS WELL DEDUCTIVE ARGUMENT JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF IS A SUFFICIENT GAUGE OF KNOWLEDGE BUT IN THE EXAMPLES GIVEN NONE OF THE BELIEFS ARE TRULY JUSTIFIED
KIND OF INTERESTING BUT RATHER SEMANTIC

ALSO I CAN SIMPLY SAY THAT THE TRUE BELIEFS IN THE GETTER CASES WERE UNJUSTIFIED THE BELIEVERS SIMPLY DID NOT DO ENOUGH INVESTIGATION
CONFESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF STILL SEEMS FINE MY BELIEF IS THERE ARE 2 BEERS IN THE FRIDGE THE JUSTIFICATION IS I PUT 2 BEERS IN THE FRIDGE I COME HOME EITHER THERE ARE 2 BEERS OR THERE ARE NOT NEITHER OUTCOME ALTERS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR MY BELIEF IT'S JUST IN ONE CASE MY BELIEF HAPPENS TO BE WRONG
MORE SIMPLY PUT KNOWLEDGE CANNOT EXIST BECAUSE WE CAN NEVER GUARANTEE PERFECT INFORMATION WE COULD ALL BE JUST BRAINS IN A VAT SUFFERING A SIMILAR PROBLEM TO THE GUY WITH THE NEWCASTLE BROWN ALE IF WE ALLOW THIS KIND OF ARGUMENT TO UNDERMINE THE ARGUMENT FOR KNOWLEDGE THEN WE HAVE AN INSURMOUNTABLE CHALLENGE
IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW SOMETHING BECAUSE BEERS CAN BE STOLEN AND PEOPLE HAVE BROTHERS GOT IT

THIS WHOLE IDEA IS FART SNIFFER OF THE HIGHEST ORDER DOES EVERYONE INVOLVED JUST HAVE TOO MANY WORDS LYING AROUND
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN ALL THE ARGUMENTS THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU'RE VAGUE ABOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE

THERE ARE TWO BEERS IN THE FRIDGE VS THE TWO BEERS I BOUGHT LAST SATURDAY ARE STILL IN THE FRIDGE

MY HUSBAND IS IN THE LIVING ROOM VS I JUST SAW MY HUSBAND IN THE LIVING ROOM OR MY HUSBAND IS IN THAT CHAIR IN THE LIVING ROOM

I EAST IT SEEMS THE JUSTIFICATION IS JUSTIFYING SOMETHING MORE SPECIFIC THAN ONE IS CONCLUDING
SO INSTEAD OF JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF KNOWLEDGE IS ACTUALLY CORRECTLY JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF NOT SURE WHY WE NEED A WHOLE ARTICLE WITH MULTIPLE EXAMPLES TO EXPLAIN THAT
THE STORY OF THE BURGLAR AND THE BEERS GOT ME TO THINKING WHAT IF THE SOLUTION IS ONE OF SPECIFICITY THE BURGLED HOMEOWNER BELIEVES TWO SPECIFIC BEERS ARE IN HIS FRIDGE AND HE IS WRONG BECAUSE HE LACKS SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM SO HE HAS JUSTIFIED FALSE BELIEF THAT THERE ARE TWO SPECIFIC BEERS IN HIS FRIDGE
REMINDS ME OF DESCARTES
AREN'T THESE ALL MORE ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF JUSTIFICATION YOU CAN NEVER KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW SOMETHING AND THESE PROBLEMS SEEM TO SHOW THAT JUSTIFICATION IS AN OBJECTIVE THING AND YOU ONLY HAVE A SUBJECTIVE VIEW OF IT SO WHILE WR CAN CLAIM WR KNOW THINGS WR CAN'T REALLY CLAIM TO KNOW THAT WE KNOW THINGS OR AT LEAST THERE ALWAYS COMES A POINT AT WHICH WE HAVE TO TAKE OUR JUSTIFICATION ON FAITH
I FEEL LIKE IF SOMEONE DRANK YOUR DRINK AND REPLACED IT AND YOU BELIEVED YOU HAD A DRINK IN YOUR FRIDGE YOU WOULD BE WRONG IN A SENSE BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME SPECIFIC DRINK SO YOU KNOWING THERE ARE DRINKS IN THE FRIDGE IS COMPLETELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND NOT NECESSARILY TRUE
BEER HE WAS CORRECT NOW HE ISN'T THINGS CHANGE

HUSBAND SHE WAS JUST PLAIN WRONG NO CONTORTIONS OF LOGIC REQUIRED

THERMOMETER HIS KNOWLEDGE IS BOTH TRUE AND JUSTIFIED BUT THE SITUATION PULLS A REGARDING WHAT HE BELIEVES HE ISN'T CONSULTING THE THERMOMETER TO CONFIRM THAT THE THERMAL EXPANSION OF MERCURY STILL WORKS CORRECTLY IN THIS UNIVERSE HE'S CONSULTING IT AS NOTHING MORE THAN A TEMPERATURE ORACLE HE DOESN'T CARE IN THE LEAST WHY THE THERMOMETER IS RIGHT IT JUST ALWAYS IS WHENEVER HE CHECKS IT EFFECTIVELY HE HAS A POWERED THERMOMETER

ARCHER STRAIGHT-UP BEGGING THE QUESTION SHE IS WRONG BECAUSE WE ASSUMED THAT A SKILLED ARCHER CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LUCKY SHOT AND A GOOD SHOT WHICH DOESN'T HOLD TRUE IF SHE WAS SKILLED ENOUGH SHE WOULD HAVE KNOWN SHE GOT LUCKY YOU HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME IN INTERVIEWS I TOTALLY POOCHED THAT SHOT BUT GOT LUCKY


EH I DON'T GET WHY THIS IS SUCH A CONUNDRUM IN THE BEER EXAMPLE THE MAN'S JUSTIFICATION SIMPLY BECAME INVALID AS SOON AS THE ROBBER DRANK HIS BEER HE THEN HAD FALSE JUSTIFICATION OF THE CONTENTS OF HIS FRIDGE WHICH IN TURN INVALIDATED HIS KNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THE BEERS WERE REPLACED ARE SIMPLY A MATTER OF LUCK THAT ALIGNED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS PREVIOUS JUSTIFICATION WHICH AT SOME POINT WAS TRUE BUT QUIT BEING SO WHEN THE ORIGINAL BEERS WERE CONSUMED IT FEELS LIKE THESE ARE UNIQUE EXAMPLES OF HOW JUSTIFICATIONS CAN BE FALSE BUT STILL LEAD THE PERSON TO A TRUE CONCLUSION BELIEF IN LAYMEN TERMS WE MIGHT CALL IT KNOWLEDGE BUT ONLY BECAUSE COLLOQUIAL USE OF THE WORD KNOWLEDGE OFTEN DISREGARDS THE VALIDITY OF THE JUSTIFICATION SO LONG AS THE ENDING CONCLUSION IS TRUE THE MAN WOULD NOT EXPLORE THE VALIDITY OF HIS PREVIOUS JUSTIFICATION BECAUSE HE WOULD ASSUME IT TO BE TRUE BASED ON HIS AFTER THE FACT OBSERVATION OF BEERS STILL BEING IN THE FRIDGE HE WILL BELIEVE THE BEERS TO BE THE SAME ONES HE PURCHASED WHICH WOULD BE A FALSE BELIEF BUT THE BELIEF THAT THERE ARE BEERS IN THE FRIDGE IS TRUE AS IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THEM BEING THERE AFTER OBSERVING THEM ON HIS RETURN HOME SO LONG AS THIS JUSTIFICATION DOES NOT INCLUDE HIS PREVIOUS JUSTIFICATION FOR THEM BEING THERE HE HAD BOUGHT AND PUT THEM THERE SIMILAR IDEA WITH THE LIVING ROOM HUSBAND BROTHER EXAMPLE THE WOMAN BUILT A TRUE CONCLUSION OUT OF AN UNTRUE JUSTIFICATION IT BECAME A LUCKY GUESS ALTHOUGH SHE MIGHT HAVE FELT IT TO BE A SURE THING BECAUSE OF HER MISGUIDED JUSTIFICATION IN REALITY SHE DID NOT HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE VALIDITY OF HER OWN KNOWLEDGE SHE JUST ASSUMED SHE DID ALTHOUGH IT STILL LED HER TO A TRUE BELIEF AGAIN JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE RIGHT EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU DO

EDIT ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT IT COULD ALSO BE ARGUED THAT AS SOON AS WE LOSE CONTACT WITH THE SOURCE OF A TRUE JUSTIFICATION THE JUSTIFICATION BECOMES INVALID SINCE WE CAN NO LONGER OBSERVE IT TO BE TRUE I'M HESITANT IN USING THIS THOUGH BECAUSE IT WOULD LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT NO KNOWLEDGE IS TRULY KNOWLEDGE AFTER ITS JUSTIFICATION HAS CEASED BEING OBSERVED SINCE NO EVENT IN OUR TIMELINE IS STATIC WE CAN ONLY HOLD BELIEFS BASED ON OBSERVATIONS AND THOSE BELIEFS CAN BE TRUE OR FALSE AND CAN LEAN TO ONE OR THE OTHER BASED ON EVENTS THAT MAY ALTER THE OUTCOME THIS SIMPLY DEVOLVES TO AN EXAMINATION OF SEMANTICS IN THE WAY WE USE THE WORD KNOWLEDGE AND HOW FLEETING KNOWLEDGE TRULY IS
THE PROBLEM ARISES FROM THE UNJUSTIFIED DEMAND THAT ANY PROPOSITION BE LABELED EITHER TRUE OR FALSE

ACTUALLY OUTSIDE OF A CLOSED SYSTEM LIKE MATHEMATICS WE KNOW NOTHING ABSOLUTELY

ALL OF OUR BELIEFS ARE ON A CONTINUUM FRO TO AND DEPENDING ON HOW IMPORTANT THE TRUTH OF THE BELIEF IS WE PICK A RELATIVELY ARBITRARY CUT-OFF POINT OF WHAT TO BELIEVE

IN A CIVIL LAWSUIT I'LL PICK PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE IN A CAPITAL CRIMINAL CASE I'LL PICK BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT WITH THE ONLY CAVIL BEING THE DEGREE OF REASONABLENESS REQUIRED

I WILL BELIEVE WHAT A THERMOMETER TELLS ME THE TEMPERATURE IS CONCEDING THAT THERE IS A VANISHINGLY SMALL PROBABILITY THAT THERE IS SOME ELABORATE CONSPIRACY TO MISLEAD ME

IF EVERYONE HAD TO APPEND SUCH A CONFIDENCE INTERVAL TO EVERY STATEMENT OF BELIEF THERE'D BE A LOT LESS DOGMATISM IN THE WORLD
KNOWLEDGE SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE STATE OF ONE'S OWN MIND AND THE STATE OF THE EXTERNAL UNIVERSE SEE HOW HARD WAS THAT
THE ROOT OF THIS PROBLEM IS A FALSE EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN PERCEPTION AND COGNITION IT FOCUSES ON INFERENCE AND WHETHER WE ARE COGNITIVELY LUCKY AND ESSENTIALLY THAT ALL IDEAS ARE BELIEFS AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY CONSTITUTE KNOWLEDGE OR NOT WE ARE REHASHING HUME AND EVEN DESCARTES EVIL GENIUS
THEORY OF DIRECT REALISM THAT IS PERCEPTION AS DIRECT AND UNMEDIATED BY INFERENCE RENDERS THE DEBATE MOOT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF IT IS THAT WHICH IS DIRECTLY PERCEIVED AND ANY IDEA THAT LAWFULLY FOLLOWS FROM IT
I READ THE ARTICLE WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND PLEASE READ THIS WITH SINCERITY NOT SARCASM WHAT'S THE POINT OF TAKING TIME TO FOCUS ON THIS TO THE POINT OF WRITING A LARGE ARTICLE AS ANOTHER POSTER WROTE YOUR ASSUMED KNOWLEDGE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE CORRECT
I'M GOING TO TAKE MICHAEL WILLIAMS POSITION AND SAY THAT THE CONCEPT OF KNOWLEDGE IS MORE LIKE THAT OF WITCH AND WARLOCK THAN LEAD OR GOLD KNOWLEDGE DOESN'T FIT WITH THE FACTS OF REALITY AND REALLY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKED ABOUT AT ALL SINCE IT DOESN'T EXIST TRADITIONAL EPISTEMOLOGY HAS A BIZARRE OBSESSION WITH AND MAKES A FETISH OF KNOWLEDGE
WE CAN NEVER REALLY KNOW ANYTHING BECAUSE WE'RE ALL JUST EXPERIENCING STUFF FILTERED THROUGH OUR BRAINS EVERYTHING UP UNTIL NOW IN MY LIFE COULD HAVE BEEN A HALLUCINATION

BUT WE HAVE TO GET ON WITH OUR LIVES AND ASSUME OUR BEERS ARE GOING TO BE THERE IN THE FRIDGE BECAUSE WE PUT THEM THERE UNTIL THINGS ARE PROVEN OTHERWISE
I ACTUALLY DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENCES OF KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING WHILE I WAS TRYING TO FIND THE LINK BETWEEN HIGHER INTELLIGENCE AND MENTAL DISORDERS IT BOILS DOWN TO THAT YOU CAN KNOW SOMETHING BUT NOT UNDERSTAND IT AND UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING LIKE AN IDIOT SAVANT MAY NOT KNOW THAT WHAT THEY RAE LOOKING AT IS A TOYOTA PICKUP ENGINE BUT THAT UNDERSTAND HOW TO DISASSEMBLE AND REASSEMBLE IT BY HAND
REMOVED
I KNOW THE REPLY TO THIS COMMENT WILL POSE A THREAT TO ME AND I'M DREADING TO READ IT YET
ALL KNOWLEDGE IS REALLY JUST A MODEL S OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF EXISTENCE INCLUDING MENTAL CONSTRUCTS I SUPPOSE AND THESE MODELS ARE DECOUPLED FROM REALITY TO SOME EXTENT PERHAPS IN SOME CASES WILDLY SO

ONE COULD EVEN ARGUE THAT THE MOST SIMPLE INFORMATION PROCESSING ACTIONS OF A VIRUS PARTICLE SUFFER FROM THESE SAME PROBLEMS

I GUESS THAT THE APPROXIMATIONS OF REALITY THAT LIFE PRODUCES CAN BE REGARDED AS SUFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY ARE OBJECTIVELY USEFUL ALTHOUGH THEY DO NOT REPRESENT REALITY WITH FIDELITY IN ANY ABSOLUTE WAY

IT IS AN INTERESTING PUZZLE TO BE SURE WITH MANY IMPLICATIONS
I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE HERE MAY STEM FROM EXPECTING KNOWLEDGE TO HAVE A RIGID WELL DEFINED MEANING DODGY ANALOGY TIME SUPPOSE I DEFINE CHAIR TO MEAN A LEGGED PIECE OF FURNITURE DESIGNED FOR SITTING THEN YOU TRY TO COUNTER THIS BY SHOWING ME A LEGGED BAR STOOL NOW WE CAN DEBATE ALL DAY WHETHER A BAR STOOL IS OR IS NOT A CHAIR BUT DOES THAT GET US ANY CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING THE ACT OF SITTING I'M NOT SURE IT DOES
IS THERE AN INFINITE REGRESS IN JUSTIFICATION

CONSIDER THE CASE OF TWO BROWN ALES IN THE FRIDGE YOU CAN BE MISTAKEN AT ALL OF THESE LEVELS

YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPOSITION ITSELF YOU THINK THERE ARE THREE YOU ARE WRONG

2 YOUR CERTAINTY ABOUT THE PROPOSITION YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY ALES THERE ARE BUT YOU GUESS TWO YOU ARE RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE LOW CERTAINTY YOU'RE ALSO RIGHT ABOUT THE LEVEL OF YOUR CERTAINTY

YOUR CERTAINTY ABOUT YOUR CERTAINTY YOU THINK YOU HAVE GOOD JUSTIFICATION TO BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO BUT YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT YOUR OWN CERTAINTY BUT RIGHT ABOUT THE PROPOSITION THIS IS THE GETTER CASE

YOUR CERTAINTY ABOUT YOUR CERTAINTY ABOUT YOUR CERTAINTY THE BURGLARS WHOM YOU KNOW ARE FOND OF ALE MADE ALL THE SIGNS OF AN BREAK-IN BUT GOT SPOOKED AT THE LAST MINUTE WHEN YOU SEE THE FORCED ENTRY YOU THINK AH HITE ME ALES BUT IN FACT ACTUALLY I'M LOST NOW
ASIDE FROM THE ISSUE OF HIDDEN SPECIFICITY WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED IN THESE COMMENTS I THINK ANOTHER ISSUE COMES FROM A PROBLEM LOGIC ALWAYS HAS WITH TIME OR CHANGE IF I SEE MY SISTER IN JANUARY AND SEE HER AGAIN IN NOVEMBER AM I WRONG THAT I'VE SEEN MY SISTER BECAUSE WHOLE SWATHES OF HER CELLS AND DIED AND BEEN REPLACED SHE'S GIVEN BIRTH TO A BABY BOY AND LOST A HAND
CAN KNOWLEDGE NOT BE THOUGHT AS TO HAVE A QUALITY IN BAYESIAN TERMS ITS LIKE COMPUTING THE POSTERIOR PROBABILITY OF ANY HYPOTHESIS
SAY H IS THE HYPOTHESIS OR KNOWLEDGE AND E IS SOME ASSUMPTION THEN THE QUALITY OF H CAN BE GIVEN BY P H E
THIS WAY STRONGER THE ASSUMING EVIDENCE HIGHER IS THE QUALITY OF KNOWLEDGE
WELL USING PROBABILISTIC APPROACH MAKES THIS PROBLEM DISAPPEARS
ALL BELIEFS ARE JUSTIFIED BUT WITH DIFFERENT PROBABILITIES
PROBABILITY THAT A UNICORN HAS DRUNK MY BEER IS ABYSMALLY LOW EVOLUTION OF A HORSE WITH A HORN ON ITS HEAD AND GETTING TO MY HOUSE TO DRINK MY BEER WITHOUT EVER BEING NOTICED BY ANYONE IT MAY BE A HORSE FROM OUTER SPACE WHICH MAKES IT GREATLY LESS PROBABLE AND SO ON
I WOULDN'T PUT ANY MONEY ON THIS BET YET
SO HOW DO WE KNOW WITH CERTAINTY WE KNOW SOMETHING WE CAN SAY THAT THINGS ARE LOGICALLY CONSISTENT SUCH AS IN TRIVIAL EXAMPLES OF ARITHMETIC BUT WHAT OF REALITY LET'S PROPOSE A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION THAT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BY THE LAWS OF NATURE SUPPOSE THAT SOMEONE HAS THEIR SENSES OVERRIDDEN BY SOME MEANS SUCH THAT A VIRTUAL REALITY SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED TO MIMIC THE REAL WORLD IS IMPLEMENTED SO THAT THE SUBJECT IS UNAWARE

I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE STUFF OF SF HOWEVER AS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT KNOWN TO BE IMPOSSIBLE IT MIGHT BE WORTH THINKING ABOUT

SO I AWAKE ONE MORNING AND GO THROUGH MY DAY I CHECK MY LOTTERY NUMBERS AND I FIND I HAVE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I SAW THE NEWS REPORT I WENT AND CLAIMED MY MONEY I KNOW I BOUGHT A NEW HOUSE AND AM LIVING A PERFECT LIFE BECAUSE I EXPERIENCE IT IT'S REAL BUT WHAT I KNOW IS UNTRUE IN THE REAL WORLD MY KNOWLEDGE IS UNTRUE

CONSIDERING THAT WE DO NOT HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO OBJECTIVE REALITY HOW CAN WE HAVE CERTAINTY PERHAPS I'M MISUNDERSTANDING TERMS BUT HOW CAN WE KNOW THAT ANYTHING IS REAL
THESE PUZZLES SEEM TO ASSUME KNOWLEDGE IS PERSISTENT HE DID NOT KNOW THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF NEWCASTLE AT HOME ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED ALL THAT HE KNEW WAS THAT TWO WEEKS AGO HE PUT TWO BOTTLES OF NEWCASTLE IN THE CABINET

WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM THEORY PERHAPS WE CAN ONLY EVER KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY OBSERVING
SO I READ THE FIRST TWO EXAMPLES
THE PROBLEM WITH THE FIRST ONE SEEMS TO SIMPLY BE THAT YOU CAN NOT KNOW SPECIFIC THINGS IN THE FUTURE YOU CAN ONLY MAKE GUESSES OR CONDITIONAL OR PROBABILISTIC STATEMENTS LIKE IF NOONE TAMPERED WITH THE BOTTLES OR ANOTHER IMPACTFUL EVENT OCCURRED THEN THEY WILL STILL BE THERE OR SAY THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THEY ARE THERE WAITING SO IN A WAY YOU CAN NOT KNOW CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT THE FUTURE

THE SECOND EXAMPLE WITH THE WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND JUST SEEMS A MISSCHARACTIZATION OF WHAT SHE ACTUALLY CAN KNOW BY SAYING SHE KNOWS HER HUSBAND IS IN THE LIVINGROOM THE PROBLEM ARISES VS THE MORE SPECIFIC STATEMENT THAT HER HUSBAND IS SITTING IN HER HUSBANDS CHAIR IF WE STATE THE CLAIM AS HER HUSBAND IS SOMEWHERE IN THE LIVINGROOM I THINK WE CAN SEE THAT MORE CLEARLY THAT THIS BELIEF IS NOT JUSTIFIED BECAUSE SHE HAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HER HUSBAND IS SITTING IN ANOTHER CHAIR IN FACT THINKING THAT HER HUSBAND IS ANYWHERE ELSE BUT SITTING IN HIS CHAIR IS UNJUSTIFIED
THIS SHARES ELEMENTS WITH THE HEISENBERG UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE SOME THINGS CAN'T BE FULLY KNOWN UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED THAT WHICH IS OBSERVED IS INHERENTLY CHANGED BY THE ACT OF BEING OBSERVED SO WHERE IS RAZOR WHEN YOU NEED IT IT'S IN THE BOX WITH CAT OR IS IT
ACCORDING TO MY VIEWS THIS SIMPLE PHILOSOPHICAL PUZZLE SHOWS THE LOSS OF REALITY WHEN TOO MUCH ABSTRACTION OCCURS ALL WE'RE DOING IS USING OUR ALREADY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE UNIVERSE WHICH WE KNOW THROUGH OUR SENSES AND ASSUMING THAT THE WORD KNOWLEDGE IN SOME WAY REPRESENTS A REALITY KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT REPRESENT A REALITY OTHER THAN THE GREY FIELD OF BELIEFS WE HOLD BELIEFS WE HOLD BECAUSE OF OUR ANCESTORS OUR EXPERIENCES KNOWLEDGE IS NOT PERFECT AND JUST BECAUSE WE CAN CONTEXTUALIZE AS BEING ACCIDENTALLY RIGHT OR WRONG REALLY TELLS US NOTHING ABOUT REALITY IT TELLS US ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR ABSTRACTION BY THE MIND AND THAT'S ABOUT IT TAKING A SITUATION TRYING TO LOOK AT IT IN GIVING CAVEATS THAT ONLY FIT PERFECTLY INTO THIS SITUATION IS ALL TAKING MORE AND MORE STEPS AWAY FROM REALITY

WE HOLD NO TRUE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT REALITY KNOWLEDGE DOESN'T EXIST OUTSIDE OF OUR PARADIGM OF THOUGHTS ABOUT IT WHAT WE CAN DO IS PERCEIVE THE REALITY AROUND US THROUGH IMPERFECT PERCEPTIONS WE HAVE VISION BUT WHAT WE SEE IS JUST WHAT DEVELOPED TO HELP US SURVIVE ME SEEING THE COLOUR PURPLE IS NOT SEEING ACTUAL REALITY IT IS JUST A PERCEPTION SAME WITH SMELL METHANE MAY SMELL LIKE SOMETHING TO ME BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT WAS EVOLVED THAT WAY

SO THAT'S THE FIRST ABSTRACTION IF WE WANT TO LABEL STEPS SENSING THE WORLD GIVES US SOME RELATIVELY USEFUL KNOWLEDGE THAT IS REALLY NOT TRUE KNOWLEDGE AT ALL THERE IS NO CERTAINTY IN IT TO BEGIN WITH THE SECOND STEP IS WORDS MY WORDS FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF REALITY ARE A FURTHER STEP FROM ACTUAL REALITY NOW I'M TAKING SOMETHING I SENSED AND PLACING A LABEL ON IT AS IF IT WERE A GENERALIZEABLE PHENOMENA NO IT IS NOT GENERALIZEABLE NO TWO ITEMS ARE EXACTLY ALIKE EVERYTHING IN SPACE TIME IS IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION BUT UNIVERSALLY THE SAME PROBABLY MY DESCRIPTION OF THE WORD PURPLE MAY MEAN SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO YOU YOU MAY ENVISION A DIFFERENT SHADE OF PURPLE MY WORD STUPID MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION IN MY VOCABULARY THAN IT DOES IN YOURS WHEN I SAY GOD DIFFERENT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF WHAT THAT WORD MEANS DIFFERENT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS EXPERIENCES RELATED TO THAT WORD AND TWO PEOPLE CAN BE MAKING ARGUMENTS ABOUT THEIR OWN PERCEPTION OF GOD BUT REALLY THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT A SYMBOLIZED WORD THAT MEANS SOMETHING A LOT DIFFERENT FOR EACH PERSON WORDS CANNOT BE ARGUED TO PERFECTION BECAUSE THEY'RE AN ABSTRACTION OF REALITY THESE ABSTRACTIONS KIND OF ACT ON A SCALE THE WORD PURPLE IS ABSTRACTED BUT IS PRETTY REBATEABLE AMONGST PEOPLE A CONCEPT OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH TRIES TO DECIPHER WHAT KNOWLEDGE IS IS A BETTER QUESTION THAT'S LEFT UNASKED OR LOOKED AT AS THE BEAUTY OF OUR BRAINS ABSTRACTIONS THERE IS NO REALITY TO BE TALKED ABOUT THERE IS NO CONCLUSIONS TO BE REACHED FOR WORDS ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH REALITY THEY ARE MERE SYMBOLS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED BUT THEY EXIST NOWHERE THEY THEMSELVES FORM FALSE BASES OF KNOWLEDGE WHEN WE THINK THAT THERE IS A UNIVERSAL DEFINITION OF CERTAIN WORDS THIS POST ITSELF USED TOO MANY WORDS ABSTRACTIONS PROBABLY
ISN'T THE SOLUTION TO THIS EXTREMELY SIMPLE YOU CAN'T CLAIM THAT YOU KNOW SOMETHING IN AN INSTANCE WHEN LUCK WOULD MAKE IT NOT SO

OR DOESN'T SIMPLY BEING MORE PRECISE CLEAR THIS UP I PUT TWO BEERS OF NEWCASTLE IN THE FRIDGE LAST NIGHT WHICH SHOULD STILL BE THERE UNLESS SOMEONE TOOK THEM



HOW ABOUT THE IDEA THAT KNOWLEDGE IN THAT SENSE DOES NOT EXIST ALL OF THE THINGS WE KNOW ARE CONTINGENT AND SOMEWHAT PROBABILISTIC I KNOW THAT THE CLOCK SAID WHEN I WALKED OUTSIDE AND SAW THE SUN RISE ASSUMING MY EYES WERE NOT A BIT BLURRY AND IT REALLY SAID


SO IF THE ROBBER ONLY REPLACED ONE BEER DID HE KNOW THAT ONE WAS THERE WHILE INCORRECTLY SUMMING THE OTHER WOULD BE
THE ARTICLE IS TALKING ABOUT CASUAL WORD USAGE IN EVERYDAY SPEECH IN THE PUREST SENSE WE CAN NEVER TRULY KNOW WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE REFRIGERATOR UNLESS WE'RE LOOKING RIGHT AT IT BUT THE INACCURACY OF COLLOQUIALISMS HAS NO IMPACT ON PURE CONCEPTS WE DEAL WITH IN RIGOROUS LOGICAL REASONING IS THE GETTER PROBLEM REALLY A DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL CONUNDRUM OR JUST AN EXERCISE IN SEMANTICS
CORRECTLY JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF AM I MISSING SOMETHING
CAN'T SEE THE PROBLEM IF YOU REPLACE THE DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE BY KNOWLEDGE IS MY CURRENT BEST MODEL OF THE SITUATION THIS ALLOWS THE MODEL TO BE WRONG WITHOUT UPSETTING THE DEFINITION
I WOULD CONTEND THAT THEY SIMPLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE TRUTH ONLY OBJECTIVE TRUTH IS KNOWLEDGE IT IS TRUE IRRESPECTIVE OF BELIEF OR IGNORANCE SUBJECTIVE TRUTH IS SIMPLY KNOWLEDGE WITH INCOMPLETE DATA A MURDERER WITH REPLACED MEMORIES IS NOT LYING WHEN HE DENIES HIS CRIME TO HIM HE SPEAKS ONLY THE TRUTH
I DON'T THINK ANYONE EVER SAID YOU CAN BE SURE ABOUT THINGS THAT AREN'T STATIC AND EVEN STATIC THINGS LIKE THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE ALTERED BY DIFFERENT FACTORS

ALL KINDS OF THINGS COULD HAPPEN TO INTERFERE WITH HIS WINE BUT THE LAW OF GRAVITY ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE
TO ME KNOWLEDGE IS MORE OF A CACHE THAT CAN BE JUSTIFIED AND TRUE AT A SPECIFIC POINT IN TIME BUT INVALIDATED AS EVENTS OCCUR AT A LATER TIME WITHOUT THE PERSON KNOWING ABOUT THESE EVENTS THE KNOWLEDGE IS ONLY TRULY VALID AT THE MOMENT IT IS LEARNED AND AFTER THAT IT IS CACHED INFORMATION WITH LESS POSSIBILITY OF BEING TRUE AS TIME PASSES
I HAVE TRIED THOUSANDS OF TIMES TO TRY TO EXPLAIN THE ANSWER TO THIS TO SOMEONE AND HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN A BLANK STARE IN RESPONSE EITHER YOU UNDERSTAND IT OR YOU DON'T AND IT SEEMS NO AMOUNT OF EXPLANATIONS WILL MAKE SOMEONE UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT PERHAPS IT IS TOO COMPLEX TO BE NORMALLY UNDERSTOOD
IN AEON IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE BRAIN IS A PREDICTION MACHINE MAKING ITS BEST GUESSES IE BELIEFS ABOUT THE CAUSES OF ITS SENSORY INPUTS IF THIS IS TRUE THEN ALL OF OUR BELIEFS ARE ULTIMATELY JUST ASSUMPTIONS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE CAUSES OF OUR SENSORY PERCEPTIONS WOULD SEEM TO CARRY GREATER WEIGHT THAN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD

IN THE CASE OF THE BEERS IN THE FRIDGE THE BELIEFS ARE

BELIEF I PUT TWO BEERS IN THE FRIDGE

BELIEF 2 THE STATE OF THE FRIDGE DOES NOT CHANGE IE THE CONTENTS DO NOT CHANGE WHEN I DO NOT OBSERVE THEM

THE DERIVED BELIEF BELIEF IS THAT WHEN I OPEN THE FRIDGE DOOR LATER THE BEERS WILL STILL BE THERE

IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STORY BELIEF IS REASONABLE IF THE STORY HAD BEEN ABOUT A SHARED FRIDGE IN THE OFFICE KITCHEN THEN THAT BELIEF COULD BE UNREASONABLE EITHER WAY ALL BELIEFS ARE ULTIMATELY ASSUMPTIONS OF SOME DEGREE
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS ONLY SEEMS LIKE A PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THAT SILLY DEFINITION THEY STARTED WITH JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF

I MEAN IT KIND IF SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING A POST MODERNIST WOULD COME UP WITH NOT AN ACTUAL DEFINITION

I LIKE THE DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE IN DAVID BOOK THE BEGINNING OF INFINITY

I CANT RECALL EXACTLY BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY EXPLANATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE GENES HAVE PACKETS OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR ENVIRONMENTS WHILE GENES WENT ON CREATING AND TRANSMITTING KNOWLEDGE THROUGH RANDOM VARIATION AND SELECTION WHAT WE CALL EVOLUTION HUMAN BEINGS USING THEIR BRAINS STARTED TO CREATE AND TRANSMIT KNOWLEDGE USING CREATIVITY AND WHAT WE CALL SCIENCE
EH THIS SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO USING AN EXTREMELY STRICT DEFINITION OF KNOW NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING EVER WHICH FINE I WON'T ARGUE WITH YOU ON THAT BUT MAYBE THE TAKEAWAY SHOULDN'T BE NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING EVER MAYBE THE TAKEAWAY SHOULD BE THE EXTREMELY STRICT DEFINITION IS UNREASONABLE AND NOT TERRIBLY USEFUL AND IT'S OK FOR WORDS TO HAVE MEANINGS THAT ARE IN SOME WAYS VAGUE
THE TITLE SOUNDS LIKE A BUZZFEED ARTICLE FFS WHAT IS THIS SUB
SKEPTICISM IS JUST AS UNREASONABLE AND UNCERTAIN AS BELIEVING IN THE VIRTUE OF KNOWLEDGE EITHER WAY VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE GENUINELY BELIEVE IN SKEPTICISM MOST INDIVIDUALS USE IT AS A SHIELD WHEN SOMEONE CHALLENGES THEIR IDEOLOGICAL CONVICTIONS
WOULD WE BE SO LUCKY TO HAVE ANY OF THESE NARRATIVES OCCUR IN A SETTING THAT DISCOUNTS FOR THE SUM OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WHICH NATURALLY CREATE BIAS AND EXPECTATION KNOWLEDGE EXPRESSED AS AN EXPECTATION SUM OF PREVIOUS PARTS
LOVE STUDYING EPISTEMOLOGY IN COLLEGE
THIS ANALYSIS MISSES BOTH THE LARGER PICTURE AND THE POINT OF KNOWLEDGE IT ASSUMES A SELF WHICH CAN KNOW ANYTHING AND THEN TRIES TO DEFINE WHAT KNOWLEDGE IS KNOWLEDGE CANNOT BE JUDGED IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS WORLD-VIEW AS IT IS TRIVIAL TO DEMONSTRATE THE LACK OF A COHERENT SELF ITS INABILITY TO KNOW ANYTHING AS IT IS AND TO DEDUCE ANYTHING FACTUAL THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE

WE HAVE TRANSITORY SELVES THAT HAVE APPROXIMATE KNOWLEDGE BASED ON A LIMITED AND INHERENTLY FLAWED INTERPRETATION OF OUR LIMITED SENSORY INPUT WHICH HAS BEEN CONDENSED INTO MEMORY AND NARRATIVE ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT IT GENERALLY FUNCTIONS AS IF THERE IS A SELF THAT HAS ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE THAT'S IT
LOUIS THE XVI HAD DEATH BROUGHT TO HIM BY THE GUILLOTINE I KNOW THAT
THE SITE CRASHED AND HERE I LEGITIMATELY THOUGHT THE PUZZLE IS TO MAKE THE SITE WORK
CAN SOMEONE POINT OUT WHAT I'M MISSING CAUSE THIS SEEMS PRETTY CUT AND DRY TO ME THESE CLEVER LITTLE STORIES WORK PERFECTLY WELL UNDER DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE

TAKE THE BEERS EXAMPLE THE BELIEF IN QUESTION IS NOT TRUE IN BELIEVING HIS BEERS ARE IN THE FRIDGE HE IS NOT LITERALLY BELIEVING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE REDUCTION I HAVE TWO BEERS IN MY FRIDGE ONLY AND NOTHING ELSE WHATSOEVER PRACTICALLY HIS BELIEF WILL BE IN A SITUATION THAT INCLUDES MANY DETAILS INCLUDING THAT HIS TWO BEERS ARE THE EXACT TWO HE LEFT THERE AND THAT THEY WERE NOT BURGLED SO IF WE'RE TO TAKE THE PRACTICAL MEANING THAT THIS IS A STORY ABOUT AN ACTUAL GUY THAT IS HAVING AN EVERYDAY BELIEF ABOUT HIS BEER HIS BELIEF IS FALSE

FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE LET'S SAY THIS IS A THOUGHT EXERCISE AND THAT THE GUY LITERALLY ONLY BELIEVES HE HAS TWO BEERS IN THE FRIDGE THEN HIS BELIEF IS TRUE IT FEELS WEIRD BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN THE PRACTICAL EXAMPLE ABOVE AND FORCED IT INTO AN OVERLY LITERAL THOUGHT EXERCISE BASED ON LANGUAGE AND NOT REAL LIFE

BUT HIS BELIEF IS STILL TRUE THERE ARE TWO BEERS IN HIS FRIDGE THAT'S LITERALLY ALL HE BELIEVES AND THEREFORE IT'S LEGIT KNOWLEDGE

TO BETTER ILLUSTRATE THIS IN A WAY THAT FEELS A BIT MORE NATURAL LET'S SAY I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE SKY IS BLUE I HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE SKY IS BLUE BUT I NEVER CONSIDERED THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE MY KNOWLEDGE IS LITERALLY JUST THAT THE SKY IS BLUE AND NOTHING MORE

I WAKE UP ONE DAY AND LOOK AT THE SKY UNBEKNOWNST TO ME IT IS NOW BLUE BECAUSE THE WORLD HAS BEEN ENCASED IN A BLUE DOME BY ALIENS MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE SKY BEING BLUE IS STILL TRUE BECAUSE IT IS LITERALLY ONLY KNOWLEDGE OF THAT WITH NOTHING CONTEXTUAL ATTACHED THE UNDERLYING REASON THE SKY IS BLUE HAS CHANGED BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE MY KNOWLEDGE WAS NEVER OF THE UNDERLYING REASON TO BEGIN WITH
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW DETERMINISTS EVEN COMPATIBALISTS SQUARE THEIR THEORIES OF KNOWLEDGE WITH DETERMINISM

WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO ENSURE THAT ONE S COGNITIVE SUCCESS IS NOT DUE TO LUCK

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANY COGNITIVE SUCCESS ONE HAS IF WE ARE GOING TO GRANT DETERMINISM IS DUE TO LUCK AND THUS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE IF WE GRANT DETERMINISM GIVEN OUR THEORIES OF KNOWLEDGE STILL EMPLOY JUSTIFICATION LACK OF LUCK


WHAT'S WRONG WITH A DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE BEING JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF THAT ISN'T A GETTER CASE
ITS VERY EASY TO KNOW SOMETHING EVEN DESCARTES GOT TOO COCKY WATCH THIS

I THINK THEREFORE ANYTHING I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT ANYTHING IS BUT I KNOW ITS THERE AND THE POSSIBILITY IS HONESTLY WAY MORE VALUABLE THAN ANY JACKASS WHO THINKS THEY KNOW WHAT SOMETHING IS IN ANY STATE YOU REALLY THINK YOURE SITTING ON SOMETHING RIGHT NOW YOURE SITTING ON PROBABILITIES NOTHING IS JUST ONE THING ANYTHING IS WHAT EXISTENCE IS THE ASSUMPTIONS HAVE TO BE CORRECT TO BEGIN ASKING THESE QUESTIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO AVOID ASSUMPTIONS LOL

DONE NOT SOLIPSISM SIMPLY THE ONLY THING I KNOW FOR SURE I DONT EXIST BECAUSE I THINK I EXIST BECAUSE IM THE OPPOSITE OF NOTHING EXISTING I KNOW THIS OTHERWISE I AM NOTHING AND EXIST BECAUSE IM NOTHING

HOW DO YOU HAVE A BAGEL IF THE MIDDLE IS EMPTY A HOLE IS THE ABSENCE OF WHAT SURROUNDS IT ITS NOT EMPTY ITS QUITE FULL YOU DONT NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE STATE OF SOMETHING IS IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE TRUE IT JUST NEEDS TO BE A QUESTION WITH AN OPEN END THE HOLE ISNT THE PART MISSING FROM THE BAGEL ITS WHAT MAKES THE BAGEL WHAT IT IS YOU NEED THE LACK OF BAGEL IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE A BAGEL THAT DOESNT BUG YOU OF COURSE NOT THEN WHY SHOULD THIS
IF YOU MAKE AN ASSUMPTION CONSCIOUSLY OR SUBCONSCIOUSLY YOU COULD BE WRONG

WHY IS THIS SUCH A BIG DEAL THIS ARTICLE WAS A FABULOUS WASTE OF TIME
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ARTICLES THAT GET MADE FUN OF FOR BEING OBVIOUS LIKE NEW STUDY SHOWS THAT DIAMOND IS HARDER THAN MARSHMALLOW
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS JUSTIFIED BELIEF KNOWLEDGE COMES FROM EXPERIENCE BELIEFS ARE IRRELEVANT TRAPS IF I SEE SOME BEER IN MY FRIDGE EXACTLY THE WAY I LEFT IT I HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT MY BEER IS THERE THE WAY I LEFT IT IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER SOMEONE DRANK MY ORIGINALS AND REPLACED THEM OR NOT OR WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT EVENTS I DID NOT EXPERIENCE
DOESN'T RAZOR CUT THROUGH MOST OF THIS IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION UNLESS OTHER EVIDENCE PRESENTS ITSELF
I'M REALLY HOPING THAT GETTER IS RELEVANT TO THE US ELECTION AND THAT TRUMP WILL FAIL MISERABLY AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
GOD THIS WORSE THAN SOMETHING WE DID IN CLASSICAL AN ESSAY PROMPT FOR A BENCHMARK ASKED US WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE OR WISDOM AND NO ONE KNEW FOR SURE
THIS SEEMS TO SIMPLY POINT OUT THE PLAINLY OBVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OS NEVER MORE THAN PROBABILITY ANYWAY IT IS ONLY HUBRIS THAT MAKES US ASSUME OUR KNOWLEDGE IS ANY MORE SPECIAL THAN A DOG REMEMBERING WHERE IT IS USUALLY FED
THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHY IGNORE PHILOSOPHERS FIRST THE BRAIN REWRITES MEMORIES EVERYTIME YOU RECALL THEM SO THERE IS NO TRUTH AND RECALL IS DIFFERENT THAN STORAGE MOST THINGS YOU HAVE LEARNED ARE STORED IN YOUR MEMORY IT IS WHETHER YOU CAN RECALL THEM ON DEMAND THAT MATTERS THE THE FIRST EXAMPLE IT IS A FALSE LOGICAL STATEMENT TO BELIEVE YOUR FRIDGE OR YOUR HOUSE WILL BE THERE WHEN YOU GET HOME THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE PAST OR THE FUTURE THAT IS AN ASSUMPTION THERE IS NO TRUTH IN AN ASSUMPTION THERE IS A FINITE PROBABILITY WHICH MAY BE VERY CLOSE TO UNITY BUT IT IS NOT UNITY
I FIND THIS TO BE AN INTRIGUING REFORMULATION BUT I AM NOT SURE WHETHER IT WILL CONVINCE MANY HALERS WHAT ABOUT THE FOLLOWING RETORT

THAT IS ALL FINE BUT SLEEPING BEAUTY CAN DEDUCE THIS HINT ALREADY ON SUNDAY IF ASKED RIGHT AFTER THE COINTOSS WITHOUT BEING PUT TO SLEEP WE SHOULD ALL AGREE HOWEVER THAT BEAUTY'S POSTERIOR SHOULD STILL BE SINCE SHE KNEW IT ON SUNDAY ALREADY AND IT DIDN'T INFLUENCE HER POSTERIOR AND SHE DOESN'T LEARN ANYTHING NEW WHEN WOKEN UP SHE SHOULD NOT UPDATE HER CREDENCE

THIS SEEMS TO PUT US RIGHT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM DOESN'T IT
THAT THERE IS NEW INFORMATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE THAT PROBABILITIES HAVE CHANGED FOR EXAMPLE CONSIDER THIS HINT

THIS COIN WAS QUANTUM ENTANGLED WITH A COIN IN ANOTHER ROOM IF THE COIN IN THE OTHER ROOM WAS FLIPPED AND CAME UP HEADS THEN THIS COIN WILL COME UP HEADS TOO

ARE THE ODDS OF THE RESULT OF THE COIN FLIP REQUIRED TO CHANGE
I'M NOT SURE THE APPEAL TO BAYESIAN FORMALISM IS DOING ANYTHING HERE THE MAIN CLAIM IS

BECAUSE THE HINT PROVIDES BEAUTY WITH NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESULT OF THE COIN FLIP IT IS ILLOGICAL FOR THE PROBABILITY OF HEADS TO REMAIN THE SAME BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER RECEIVING THE HINT

I AGREE WITH THIS BUT HALERS DON'T AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BAYESIAN FORMALISMS TO FORCE THEM TO IT'S AS EASY TO WRITE DOWN COHERENT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS WHERE PROB HEADS HINT PROB HEADS AS IT IS TO WRITE DOWN DISTRIBUTIONS WHERE THAT'S NOT THE CASE

REMEMBER IT'S NO PART OF BAYESIAN ORTHODOXY THAT PROBABILISTIC INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN EMPIRICAL PROPOSITIONS DEALING WITH A SIMILAR SUBJECT MATTER IS TO BE AVOIDED THIS MIGHT FALL OUT OF YOUR FAVORITE PHILOSOPHICAL VIEW BUT IT DOESN'T FALL OUT OF BAYESIANISM

WHAT'S DOING ALL THE WORK IN YOUR CLAIM IS THE WORD ILLOGICAL AND THAT'S JUST A WAY OF SAYING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO PLUG IN ONE OR MORE STANDARD ARGUMENTS AGAINST BEING A HALFER IN THE PLACE OF THIS WORD

ALMOST EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS DEBATE ON BOTH SIDES IS A BAYESIAN THEY KNOW HOW TO SQUARE THEIR VIEWS WITH BAYESIAN ORTHODOXY


THE SLEEPING BEAUTY PROBLEM DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER AS LONG AS WE DO NOT STIPULATE EXACTLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY HOW BEAUTY ASSIGNS PROBABILITY TO COIN FLIPS TO TAKE AN EXTREME EXAMPLE SHE MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND PROBABILITY AT ALL AND SIMPLY ASSIGN HEADS A PROBABILITY OF BECAUSE SHE THINKS IS A BEAUTIFUL NUMBER OR SHE MIGHT BE REBELLIOUS AND ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY OF HEAD WITH CAULIFLOWER WITHOUT SPECIFYING THAT HER ASSIGNMENT OF PROBABILITIES HAS TO BE CORRECT AND A CLEAR DESCRIPTION OF WHAT CORRECT MEANS THE HALERS AND THE THIRDNESS ARE JUST AS WRONG AS THE ERS AND THE

MY SUSPICION IS THEREFORE THAT THE PARADOX IS CAUSED BY THE INABILITY OF EITHER CAMP TO COME UP WITH A SATISFACTORY REASON AS TO WHY BEAUTY SHOULD PREFER THEIR METHOD OF ASSIGNING PROBABILITIES OVER THE OTHER THIS SUSPICION IS FURTHER STRENGTHENED BY THE FACT THAT IF ONE INTRODUCES AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE FOR PROBABILITY THE PARADOX VANISHES AS DESCRIBED IN THE OVERNATIONALIZATION SECTION OF THE WIKI PAGE LINKED BY OP
DELETED
I GET THE SENSE I DON'T FULLY GET THIS AT ALL IS IT JUST THAT NOTHING IS LACKING FUNDAMENTALLY EXCEPT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER THINGS
THANK YOU FOR THIS
IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE FURTHER CLARIFICATION OR REFERENCE THE PHILOSOPHER GILLES DELEUZE HAS ALSO WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY ON THIS TOPIC IN HIS BOOK PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY

YOU CAN FIND THIS ON PAGE OF THE PDF BELOW

MEDIA
THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE IDEA THAT NOTHING IN THE FOREGROUND IS SEPARATE FROM THE BACKGROUND BOTH SIDES CONTRIBUTE TO EACH OTHER YET WHERE ONE BEGINS AND ONE ENDS IS DECIDED BY OUR PERCEPTION AND IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THE MOLECULAR DIVIDING LINE OF THE TWO SEPARATE OBJECTS WHEN INSPECTED
WORDS THEMSELVES EXPLAIN IT A LOT BETTER THAN THE ANALYSIS OF THEM DOES
I HAVE IN MIND THE WORK OF MATURANT AND VARELA AND THEIR BIOLOGICAL THEORY OF LIFE AUTOPOIESIS BUT ALSO GENERAL NEO-DARWINIAN ACCOUNTS I HAVE YET TO HEAR ANY THEORY OF BIOLOGY WHICH WOULD SUPPORT A HEGELIAN VIEW OF THE WORLD

I ALMOST DROPPED MY COFFEE WHEN I READ THAT LET ME COUNTER THAT WITH WIKIPEDIA

IN HIS DISCUSSION OF HEGEL THE PHILOSOPHER SLAVDOM ZIZEL ARGUES THAT HEGEL IS TO USE TERMS THE ULTIMATE THINKER OF AUTOPOIESIS

BUT PUTTING THAT ASIDE YOU CAN SEE THE INCREDIBLE INFLUENCE ON GESTALT PSYCHOLOGY ON MERLEAU-PONTY ON CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY'S LACK OF INTEREST IN THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS ABOUT BRAINS IN JARS IN THE COMPLETION OF KANT WITH BODES BODY AND WORLD WITH LACONIAN PSYCHOANALYSIS AND ON AND ON
THIS IS ALSO A SPECTACULAR EXAMPLE OF BAD WRITING

LIMITED BY ITS LOFTINESS

HARD TO READ

TEDIOUS

YUCK
THIS IS JUST A FORM OF OBJECTIVISM TO ME IF YOU DESCRIBE THE SAME THING WITHOUT REMOVING HUMAN EMOTION AND IMPULSE AS SPINOZA DOES THEN THIS TURNS INTO AN EVERYONE GETS THEIR FAIR SHARE AND SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH IT ARGUMENT WHICH I DO NOT SUPPORT LIKE THIS AT ALL PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG HERE
I DATED THIS GIRL WHO WOULD CALL CAMUS BASIC BECAUSE IN HER UNDERSTANDING PHILOSOPHY HAD TO BE WRAPPED IN COMPLEX WORDS AND PROFOUND ANALOGIES WE WOULD ARGUE OR I WOULD THAT THE BEAUTY OF CAMUS IS HOW HE WOULD PRESENT THIS DEEP AND MEANINGFUL THOUGHTS IN A SIMPLE MATTER WITHOUT GETTING ENGROSSED IN HIS OWN INTELLECTUALITY THAT HIS OWN LIFE WAS A PERFECT RECREATION OF WHAT HE THOUGHT LIFE SHOULD BE THAT IN THE END HE WAS INDEED HAPPY
THERE IS NO MORE DREADFUL PUNISHMENT THAN FUTILE AND HOPELESS LABOR

MY PHILOSOPHY TEACHER USED TO SAY THIS ALL THE TIME
TO ME THE BRILLIANCE OF AMOS IS OF COURSE THE STRANGER CAMUS SEEMS TO ME TO BE ONE OF THE EARLIEST WRITERS TO WHOLLY GRASP WHAT DOSTOEVSKY DID WITH HIS CHARACTERS TO TAKE A PHILOSOPHICAL IDEA AND PLACE IT INTO A CHARACTER A FREE AND INDEPENDENT PERSONALITY IN WORDS AND SEE IT THROUGH TO ITS MOST EXTREME END

THIS MAY SEEM OBVIOUS TO SOME MODERN READERS BUT CONTEMPORARIES FOUND SO MANY OF HIS CHARACTERS LIKE KRILOV TO BE SO PREPOSTEROUS THAT SOME OF HIS GREATEST WORKS WERE CONSIDERED TO BE CRAP ESPECIALLY BY HIS FORMER BELINSKY CIRCLE OF WRITERS

I THINK CAMUS TRIED TO CUT OFF THIS TYPE OF CRITICISM BY CLEARLY WRITING OUT A PHILOSOPHICAL IDEA THEN FOLLOWING IT WITH A NOVEL THAT PLACES THAT IDEA INTO THE WORLD AND LETS IT SINK OR SWIM AS IT RUNS UP AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER PEOPLE CAMUS EAR FOR PEACH AND PROSE IS ALSO WHAT MAKE HIS PHILOSOPHY SO ACCESSIBLE IMO HE CAN WRITE HIS IDEAS OUT IN A SIMPLE FORM BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A TALENTED PROSE WRITER

THROUGH THIS VIEW OF CAMUS THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS THE STRANGER AND THE REBEL THE PLAGUE STAND OUT AS ONE OF THE MOST WELL PROPOSED AND ARGUED PHILOSOPHIES IN WRITTEN HISTORY IN MY EXTREMELY HUMBLE OPINION
ONE MUST IMAGINE SISYPHUS HAPPY
GOOD POST BUT THE FORMATTING IS WORTHY OF R CRAPPYDESIGN
LA DISPUTE SIX
THEY SING MOST OF THIS TEXT
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEM PLEASE CHECK IT OUT
THEY'RE AWESOME
HAD TO SHARE
I AM NOWADAYS FOLLOWER OF ABSURDISM
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO READ THE REBEL AS A FOLLOW UP
COULDN'T LIKE THIS MORE IF I TRIED
ONE OF THE BEST ESSAYS OF ALL TIME THE LANGUAGE IS BEAUTIFUL IN THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT IT IS LIKE IN FRENCH
FINALLY MY UNDERNAME IS REMOTELY RELEVANT
I NEVER GOT THIS ONE

STILL DONT
THANK YOU ALL I THOUGHT I'D SHARE THIS BECAUSE I ENJOYED THE READING SO MUCH AND I'M GLAD IT RESONATED WITH SO MANY OF YOU HERE I REALLY LIKE THE BRILLIANT AND REBELLIOUS CHARACTER OF SISYPHUS AND THE IDEA OF BEING IN CONTROL OF YOUR OWN FATE LIFE CAN BE SOMETIMES BE DIFFICULT AND ABSURD BUT IF YOU REALIZE THAT YOU ARE ULTIMATELY IN CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE ALL IS WELL
READING THIS AFTER READING HIS MORE LITERARY THE STRANGER GAVE ME THE SAME REACTION AS THE FIRST TIME I SAW ONE OF NON ABSTRACT WORKS
YOU DESCRIBE THE WORLD THROUGH IMAGERY I REALIZE NOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO BEAUTIFUL POETRY I SHALL NEVER KNOW IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF THAT BOOK THANKS FOR REMINDING ME OF THIS
THEY HAD THOUGHT WITH SOME REASON THAT THERE IS NO MORE DREADFUL PUNISHMENT THAN FUTILE AND HOPELESS LABOR

SOUNDS LIKE MY JOB
I WAS INSPIRED BY SISYPHUS TO MAKE THIS FUTURISTIC RENDITION OF THE MYTH

WATCH V
A BEING OF THE UNDERWORLD
SISYPHUS IS ETERNAL
LIFTING HIS STONE HIGH UP THE MOUNTAIN EACH DAY
ONLY FOR IT TO ROLL DOWN EACH NIGHT

SUBJECT TO CHIPS CRACKS AND INDIGNITIES
HIS STONE HOWEVER IS MORTAL
AND WEARS AWAY FROM HIS STEADY EFFORT

THE GODS SET HIM TO THIS TASK
AND HE WILL COMPLETE IT

ON THE MORNING WHEN ONLY A PEBBLE REMAINS
SISYPHUS WILL CRUSH IT UNDER HIS HEEL

AN INTERESTING FACT IS THAT CAMUS DIED IN A CAR CRASH AND IN HIS COAT WAS A TICKET IN HIS COAT FOR A TRAIN THAT HE HAD MISSED I'D LIKE TO THINK HE WE LIVING IN THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT AND CHOSE NOT TO GO HE WAS A GOOD PHILOSOPHER AND THOUGH WE MAY NOT SEE EYE TO EYE THIS AND THE STRANGER ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE PHILOSOPHY OF ABSURDISM IN ANOTHER NOTE I HAVE ALWAYS WONDERED WITH HIS PHILOSOPHY THAT IF SLAVES COULD BE ARGUED AS HAPPY
I READ THIS AS THE MYTH OF SYPHILIS
THEN THE TOP COMMENT ME AND MY GIRL WOULD ARGUE
ODD COINCIDENCE BUT I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO AN AUDIOBOOK OF THE STRANGER ALL DAY VERY DIFFERENT FOR PHILOSOPHY TEXTS
THE WHOLE BEING IS EXERTED TOWARD ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING THIS IS THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID FOR THE PASSIONS OF THIS EARTH
WHEN PUT IT INTO THE CONTEXT OF THE REST OF THE MYTHOLOGY SURROUNDING SISYPHUS HIM BEING HAPPY AND ACTUALLY ENJOYING HIS TASK IS THE ULTIMATE SPIT IN THE FACE OF THE GODS AND PROBABLY THE GREATEST OF LAST LAUGHS
KINDA HOW I GOT MY UNDERNAME ONE OF THE FIRST PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS I EVER READ
CAMUS WAS A STRANGER
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WORKS OF ALL TIME PHILOSOPHY OR NOT I HAD TRIED GETTING INTO CAMUS SEVERAL TIMES AND JUST COULDN'T APPROACH HIM IN A WAY THAT I GAINED AN APPRECIATION WHILE I WAS IN COLLEGE DOING VERY WELL ACADEMICALLY BUT HAVING A MYRIAD OF DIFFICULTIES PERSONALLY I STARTED TO READ THIS TEXT AND IT REALLY AFFIRMED FOR ME THESE THOUGHTS THEORIES AND EMOTIONS THAT I HAD BEEN TRYING TO SORT OUT AND GAVE ME DIRECTION IT CERTAINLY WON'T DO THAT FOR EVERYONE BUT IT REALLY SPOKE TO ME AND FOR THAT I'LL ALWAYS APPRECIATE IT
HE APPROACHES IT WITH DETERMINATION A GOAL UNQUESTIONABLE AND CENTRAL IT IS A SPHERE OF THE MOST COMMON GRANITE IT MAY HAVE ONCE HAD A SHARP EDGE THAT HAS LONG SINCE BEEN GROUND DOWN TO SOFT CURVES AND GENTLE HANDHOLDS HE THINKS HIMSELF FORTUNATE FOR IT IT IS UNLIKELY HE WILL CUT HIMSELF THERE ARE CRACKS IN THE GRANITE THAT HE KNOWS ALMOST FROM WITHIN HE KNOWS THE FLAT SPOTS THAT WILL SLOW HIM DOWN HE KNOWS THE GRIPS THAT WILL PROVIDE THE BEST LEVERAGE AND THE GRIPS THAT WILL PROVIDE THE MOST FORCE HE BRACES HIMSELF AGAINST IT LETTING HIS HANDS CALLUSED AND DRY DIG INTO THE DIRT AT ITS BASE HIS ARMS AND CHEST CREATING A CRADLE AS HE LOWERS HIS WEIGHT EVEN WITH THE WEIGHT OF HIS PARTNER THE STONE IS COLD BUT WARM WITH FAMILIARITY HE BREATHS DEEP WITH AN ENORMOUS EFFORT THE BOULDER IS SHIFTED FROM IT S RESTING PLACE IN THE VALLEY AND THEY BEGIN THE ASCENT

THE GRADIENT IS SHALLOW AT FIRST BUT HE KNOWS THE PATH STEEPENS THE WIND IS A CONSTANT SPITTING DUST INTO HIS EYES HOWLING LIKE A LONELY ANIMAL SOMEWHERE IN THE DISTANCE HE DOESN T STOP TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT ELSE MIGHT BE IN THE DISTANCE MAYBE IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AFTER BUT FOR NOW THE TASK AT HAND IS THE PRIORITY HIS MOUTH IS DRY AND HIS GRUNTS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF HIS COMPANION SOUND MIDWAY BETWEEN A WHISPER AND A SOB

THE TENDONS IN HIS FINGERS ARE SCREAMING HIS LEGS SHAKE HIS KNEES ACHE AND HIS SHOULDER IS BRUISED FROM BEING WEDGED AGAINST THE GREAT REDDISH BROWN ROCK SPECKLED WITH GREY AND BLUE AND EVEN GREEN HE WONDERS WHAT FIRE DEEP IN THE EARTH FORGED SUCH A BEAST OF DENSE CRYSTALLINE BEAUTY HIS MUSCLES HIS BONES THE WHOLE OF HIS BODY BEG HIM TO STOP TO REST BUT TO REST IS TO BE DEFEATED TO STOP IS TO DIE THIS IS HIS CHARGE THIS IS HIS EXISTENCE AND HE WILL CONQUER IT WITH EACH LABORED STEP THE DIRT BENEATH HIS BARE FEET SHIFTS AND HALF OF EVERY STRIDE GAINED IS LOST AGAIN AS THE PAIR SURGE UP AND SLIDE DOWN THE INCREASINGLY STEEP HILL OCCASIONALLY HE WILL LOSE HIS FOOTING ENTIRELY SINKING TO HIS KNEES AND IT IS ALL HE CAN DO TO HOLD THE BEHEMOTH AT BAY USING HIS UPPER BODY AS A WEDGE AT ITS BASE WHILE HE REGAINS HIS OWN BUT WITHOUT FAIL HE STARTS AGAIN

TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY UP THE INCLINE IS SUCH THAT WHEN HE READIES HIMSELF FOR A HEAVE ARMS BENEATH ITS WEIGHT CHEST AND CHEEK AND EAR RESTING ON IT HE CAN SEE THE LEVEL APEX ALMOST PEDESTALED JUST BARELY OVER THE TOP OF THE ROCK THE SWEAT POURS FROM HIM COATING EACH FACE AND MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO GET A GOOD GRIP BUT WITH EACH TURN THE DIRT ON THE GROUND IS PICKED UP AS WELL TO AN EXTENT DRYING THE STONE AND ABSORBING THE SWEAT BUT HE KNOWS AT A CERTAIN POINT IT WILL TURN TO MUD THE THOUGHT ALONE IS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM TIRED TIRED OF THE CLIMB TIRED OF THE EFFORT TIRED OF BEING TIRED HE DOES NOT REMEMBER WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO NOT BE STRUGGLING BENEATH THE ROCK HE DOES NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING BEFORE THE TASK HE DOES NOT FEEL NOSTALGIA FOR A PRIOR LIFE HE DOES NOT HOPE FOR A FUTURE REPRIEVE THIS IS HIS PUNISHMENT THIS IS HIS EXISTENCE HE DOUBTS HIS LEGS AS THEY SHAKE VIOLENTLY BENEATH HIM MAYBE THEY WILL GIVE OUT THIS TIME MAYBE HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE IT AGAIN WHAT WILL HAPPEN WILL HE BE CRUSHED HE HEAVES AGAIN AND AS HE FEELS HIS BACK GROAN AND ABDOMEN BURN LIKE FIRE ON THE VERGE OF RUPTURE THE BEAST SHIFTS IT GIVES GROUND ASKING HIM TO TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

TEARS MIX WITH SWEAT HIS HEART BEATS LOUDLY IN HIS EARS HE CAN FEEL HIS BLOOD THROBBING IN HIS HANDS IN HIS FOREARMS IN HIS LEGS THE ENTIRE EARTH THROBS EVEN THE MIGHTY ROCK THROBS WITH HIM THE SUMMIT IS SO CLOSE AND WITH HIS FINAL STRENGTH HE PUSHES ON BUT DOUBTS HE IS BATTERED AND BEATEN AND THE BOULDER IS UNSYMPATHETIC HE CAN FEEL IT HATING HIM HATING HIS WEAKNESS HATING HIS FAILURE HE CAN ALMOST HEAR IT LAUGHING AT HIM THE GODS LAUGHING AT HIM IT CAN SEE EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS DONE ALL THE DISTANCE HE HAS COME THE DISTANCE THEY HAVE CROSSED TOGETHER AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH THE STONE A MERE ARM S LENGTH AWAY FROM A LEVEL RESTING PLACE SUDDENLY BECOMES HEAVIER THAN ANY MAN COULD BEAR HE STRAINS WITH ALL HE HAS LEFT AGAINST IT BUT IT OVERCOMES HIM HIS LEGS BUCKLE HIS BACK GIVES WAY HIS ARMS GO SOFT AND THE BURDEN SLOWLY STARTS BACK DOWN THE HILL

IT GAINS SPEED IT FOLLOWS THE PATH THEY PAVED IN ANGUISH BACK DOWN THE HILL WITH HIM LAYING AT THE TOP DEFEATED WATCHING HIS WORK BECOME UNDONE AS IT COMES TO A REST AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY THE WIND BLOWS HARDER AND HOWLS DEEPER AND THE SUN BEATS DOWN UPON HIM HE SEES FROM HIS VANTAGE POINT THE GREAT DISTANCE AND GREAT HEIGHT HE MOVED HIS CHARGE HE PULLS HIMSELF FIRST TO HIS KNEES THEN TO HIS FEET HE STANDS OVER HIS DOMAIN AND KNOWS THE TASK BEFORE HIM SLOWLY BUT WITHOUT TREPIDATION HE WALKS BACK DOWN THE HILL TOWARD HIS COMPANION AS HE NEARS IT THE SCORN WITHIN HIM SOLIDIFIES

HE APPROACHES IT WITH DETERMINATION A GOAL UNQUESTIONABLE AND CENTRAL IT IS A SPHERE OF THE MOST COMMON GRANITE IT MAY HAVE ONCE HAD A SHARP EDGE THAT HAS LONG SINCE BEEN GROUND DOWN TO SOFT CURVES AND GENTLE HANDHOLDS HE THINKS HIMSELF FORTUNATE FOR IT IT IS UNLIKELY HE WILL CUT HIMSELF THERE ARE CRACKS IN THE GRANITE THAT HE KNOWS ALMOST FROM WITHIN HE KNOWS THE FLAT SPOTS THAT WILL SLOW HIM DOWN HE KNOWS THE GRIPS THAT WILL PROVIDE THE BEST LEVERAGE AND THE GRIPS THAT WILL PROVIDE THE MOST FORCE HE BRACES HIMSELF AGAINST IT LETTING HIS HANDS CALLUSED AND DRY DIG INTO THE DIRT AT ITS BASE HIS ARMS AND CHEST CREATING A CRADLE AS HE LOWERS HIS WEIGHT EVEN WITH THE WEIGHT OF HIS PARTNER THE STONE IS COLD BUT WARM WITH FAMILIARITY HE BREATHS DEEP WITH AN ENORMOUS EFFORT THE BOULDER IS SHIFTED FROM IT S RESTING PLACE IN THE VALLEY AND THEY BEGIN THE ASCENT ONE MUST IMAGINE SISYPHUS HAPPY
I JUST DID A PROJECT ON THIS
WHAT UP SWARTHMORE
I FIND THAT CAMUS DESCRIBES A VERY GOOD QUESTION IN HIS BOOK TO SOME PEOPLE LIFE IS WITHOUT MEANING THAT IS TO SAY THERE WAS NO REASON TO KEEP LIVING WHICH IS A PROBLEM WITH SOCIETY I BELIEVE WE CAUSE IT TO BE SO HOWEVER I ALSO BELIEVE THAT GIVING LIFE MEANING IS AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION THAT THE MEANING YOU GIVE YOUR LIFE IS UP TO YOU AND THAT THERE IS NOT ONE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE INSTEAD I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT OURSELVES
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL SPOKEN WORD POETRY VERSION OF THIS DONE BY THE BAND LA DISPUTE I'M ON MOBILE RIGHT NOW BUT WHEN I FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHARE LINKS I'LL EDIT THIS COMMENT

EDIT
EDIT ALREADY POSTED WHOOPS
IS THERE A REASON HE MIXES GREEK AND ROMANTIC MYTHOLOGY
CALBERT ANUS
WAS INTRODUCED TO CAMUS BY WATCHING EVERYBODY WANTS SOME IN AN ENDING MONOLOGUE WHERE THEY TALKED ABOUT SISYPHUS ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS FILM IT ENDED UP HELPING ME WRITE MY PERSONAL STATEMENT TO GET INTO PHARMACY SCHOOL
ONE OF THE GREAT WORKS OF OUR TIME IT'S NOT JUST THAT LIFE IS MEANINGLESS OR THAT THE UNIVERSE DOESN'T CARE IT'S THAT EVEN IF LIFE HAD MEANING WE ARE INCAPABLE OF KNOWING WHAT IT IS
FOR ANYONE INTERESTED I'VE LINKED AN EXCELLENT POST REGARDING THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS AND THE NOTION OF SUICIDE IN AN EXISTENTIAL WORLD THE ARTICLE IS TITLED THE ABSURD COURAGE OF CHOOSING TO LIVE
BLOG
AS I UNDERSTAND IT LIFE INHERENTLY IS TO SUFFER AND SISYPHUS IS A SMART GUY BECAUSE HE HAS THE ABILITY TO REALIZE HIS SUFFERING AND IS CONTENT WITH SUFFERING
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW I AM SUPPOSED TO TAKE THAT OR WHAT TO MAKE OF IT AM I SUPPOSED TO ENJOY THE SUFFERING MY ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION CAUSE ME IF I WANT TO BE AS SMART AS SISYPHUS
MORESO HOW DOES THAT TIE IN WITH THE IT COULD BE BETTER SO I'M GOING TO WORK TOWARDS THAT MENTALITY
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE SOME MUCH NEEDED CLARITY
FUN FACT ALBERT GRAND-NEPHEW IS A TV SHOW PERSONALITY IN JAPAN THANE CAMUS
THE BACKGROUND ON THIS WEBPAGE IS THE WORST DECISION
REMOVED
I JUST SAID THIS ON ANOTHER POST BUT HAPPINESS IS AN EMOTION WHICH SIMPLY SEEMS SO SUBJECTIVE TO ME I CANNOT RECONCILE ATTRIBUTING SUCH SUPREME IMPORTANCE TO SUBJECTIVITY

THE ROOT ABSURD IS SUCH AN APPROPRIATELY COINED TERM BUT AT LEAST YOU ABSURDIST DO NOT SEEM AS LUGUBRIOUS AS US NIHILISTS
AH MAN TAKES ME BACK TO SOME HAZY DAYS I REMEMBER MY MAN CAMUS WROTE ABOUT A WRITER IN THIS BOOK WHO KILLED HIMSELF TO PROMOTE WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS A MASTERPIECE OF FICTION TURNS OUT BUDDY IS NOW BURIED SIX FEET UNDER AND THE STACK OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS WILL HOLD HIM DOWN IN PERPETUUM REAL SAD TIME

ALSO I HAVE TO SAY I RELATE TO SISYPHUS I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS PERSON BUT A SPIRITUAL PERSON RIGHT BUT UNFORTUNATELY TREKKING MY NEWSPAPER ROUTE WITH GALLSTONES WAS A PHYSICAL PURSUIT AFTER READING THIS FINE BOOK I BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE DETAILS AROUND ME FOX OF A SISTER SUNTANNING BILLY WORKING ON HIS CAR ENGINE MY FRIENDS JUMPING THROUGH A LAWN SPRINKLER AND OF COURSE SOME GOOD OL ROCK AND ROLL COMING FROM THE CASSETTES OF CARS JUST PASSING ME BY THE SUBURBAN HOUSES ON THAT SUNNY DAY HAD STORIES TO THEM IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND CAMUS TAUGHT ME THAT IT'S NOT THE JOURNEY BUT THE DESTINATION OR MAYBE THE OPPOSITE MY BAD

BUT MAN THOSE GALLSTONES HURT LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER IT DIDN'T MATTER THOUGH THE PAIN WAS WORTH THE ABILITY TO SEE THE BEAUTY ROCK ON CAMUS
BOB DYLAN PUT THE BURDEN OF SISYPHUS MORE INSIGHTFULLY EVERYONE MUST GET STONED
THE STRANGER WAS BETTER
I WISH PEOPLE WOULD BE CONCISE WHEN DISCUSSING PHILOSOPHY
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS THIS WAS A GOOD READ I CAN'T AFFORD THIS COLLEGE AT ALL SO NICE TO SEE THAT FANCY CAMPUS IS TEACHING SOMETHING USEFUL TO THE YOUNG
I USED TO LOVE CAMUS BUT THEN I READ BECKETT
YOU'RE ALL LIKE ICARUS
LOL OF COURSE IT'S SWARTHMORE LITERALLY EVERYONE HERE OWNS OR AT LEAST HAS READ CAMUS I MYSELF HAVE A COPY OF THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS WAITING FOR ME ON THE BOOKSHELF
REMOVED
I THINK THE TENSION SHE SEES WHICH I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE I SEE AS STRONGLY ALTHOUGH I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE'S SAYING BETWEEN LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY IS VERY INTERESTING ESPECIALLY IN THAT SHE TALKS ABOUT THIS TENSION BEING APPARENT IN THE WORK AND LIVES OF THE WRITERS SHE IS TALKING ABOUT BUT SHE HERSELF ALSO SEEMS TO SHARE

ALSO A READING OF MOBY DICK WHICH I HAVEN'T REALLY COME ACROSS BEFORE
THE COMMON VAGUENESS OF THE WORD HEAP REVEALS OUR LACK OF CONCERN FOR PRECISION WITH THAT CONCEPT IF WE CARED ENOUGH ABOUT HEAPS TO PRECISELY DEFINE HEAP THEN WE WOULD DO EXACTLY THAT MUCH LIKE WE DECIDED THE CONCEPTS OF DISTANCE MASS ETC WERE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO DEVELOP THE MORE EXACT TERMS METER GRAM ETC

EDIT CLARITY
I WAS ASKED THIS QUESTION YEARS AGO AND MY REPLY WAS FOUR THAT'S HOW MANY GRAINS

U GRIME MAY HAVE A POINT SAYING THREE IN THAT YOU HAVE TWO AND ONE IN THE MIDDLE BUT I TEND TO SAY THAT THREE ON THE BOTTOM AND ONE NESTLED IN BETWEEN BETTER REPRESENTS THE GEOMETRY OF A HEAP RATHER THAN TWO WITH ONE IN BETWEEN

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS ENTIRE PREMISE IS THAT VAGUENESS IS OFTEN QUITE USEFUL YOU DON'T USUALLY NEED TO KNOW THE PRECISE TEMPERATURE HUMIDITY OR RAIN VOLUME WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE YOU JUST NEED A VAGUE IDEA WHICH WORKS FOR HUMANS REALLY WELL

TAKE ANY EXAMPLE YOU LIKE AND I'LL NOW GIVE A VIEW

I'M HUNGRY VAGUE AS ALL GET OUT DOES NOT CONVEY HOW MANY CALORIES I MIGHT NEED OR THE NUTRITIONAL BALANCE JUST THAT I REQUIRE SUSTENANCE TO SATIATE THAT BIOLOGICAL NEED

I'M REALLY HUNGRY AND I NEED TO EAT SOON AGAIN VAGUE HOW SOON NEXT FIVE SECONDS OR I'LL FALL OVER PROBABLY NOT BUT IT DOES CONVEY THE VAGUE IDEA OF WHAT I'M TRY TO GET ACROSS

NO ONE REALLY LOOKS AT A SMALL HEAP OF SAND AND SAYS GOSH I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL THAT ALTHOUGH HEAP GENERALLY IMPLIES THAT IT'S BIG ENOUGH THAT RELATIVE TO YOUR BODY SIZE YOU CAN SAY THAT'S A BIG HEAP OF SAND

VAGUENESS IT'S USEFUL

ADMITTEDLY IT'S USEFUL IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS TO PRECISIONS BUT IT'S STILL QUITE USEFUL
THE SAND FORMS PICTURED WERE SCULPTED AND WETTED WITH SOME FORM OF
BONDING AGENT TO CALL THEM HEAPS IS NOT VAGUE IT IS PROMOTING A FALSEHOOD
VAGUENESS SEEMS TO BE LIKE AN ANALOGY FOR NEURAL NETS WITH LAYERS AND WEIGHTS THE CONFUSION WITH VAGUENESS IS PERHAPS LIKE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY INDIVIDUAL NODES HAVE THE WEIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE PEOPLE GET A NATURAL FEELING OF UNDERSTANDING IN THEIR HEAD THAT OBJECT A IS A HEAP AND OBJECT B ISN'T THEN A CONFUSING OBJECT C COMES IN THAT ISN'T SO CLEARLY BIASED TOWARDS BEING A HEAP OR
THE ANSWER IS POSSIBLY 2 A HEAP IS A BUNCH OF THINGS STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER YOU NEED TWO TO MAKE A STACK THREE IF YOU WANT A PYRAMID
SURE POTENTIALLY ANYTHING COULD BE POSSIBLE
MICHIO AKU IN A BOOK TALKS ABOUT IT AND SAYS IT'S POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE
THIS IS A SLIGHTLY COMMENT BECAUSE I AM NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THE LINKED VIDEO DIRECTLY BUT RUPERT SHELDRAKE HAS A FAIRLY INFAMOUS REPUTATION HE IS ONE OF A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN TED PRESENTATIONS WHOSE PRESENTATIONS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CENSORED AND DISAVOWED BY THE TED ORGANIZATION YOU CAN FIND HIS PRESENTATION ON YOUTUBE WITH A LITTLE SEARCHING IT IS WORTH WATCHING
ENDOGENOUS DMT SHELDRAKE LIKELY KNOWS AT ABOUT THIS AS HE USED TO GIVE LECTURES ALONGSIDE TERENCE MCKENNA

CULTURES WHO HAVE EMBRACED PSYCHEDELIC COMPOUNDS UNDERSTAND TELEPATHY FAR BETTER THAN PEOPLE WHO INTELLECTUALIZE AND TRY TO RATIONALIZE IT WITHOUT ANY ACTUAL EXPERIENTIAL DATA AND THEY WOULDN'T WASTE THEIR TIME ARGUING WITH YOU ABOUT IT THEY'D TELL YOU THAT SOME HIGHER INTELLIGENCE OR FREQUENCY OR WAVELENGTH THAT WE ALL EMANATE CONTAINS OR ATTRACTS THE INFORMATION THAT MAKES TELEPATHY AND OTHER UNBELIEVABLE COINCIDENCES NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT A PERSONAL FAVORITE IN SPICE RACK

DMT AND MEO WHO I CALL CHAIRMAN MEO EXIST ENDOGENOUSLY AND HAVE BEEN BARELY RESEARCHED FOR UTTERLY NEFARIOUS REASONS IT'S EXTREMELY LIKELY THAT MANY SO-CALLED MYSTERIES OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS WILL BE RATHER QUICKLY SOLVED WHEN WE ADD THE PUZZLE DESIGNER'S VISION TO THE TABLE FULL OF SCATTERED PIECES WE'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH LIKE KIDS WITH CRUDE BLOCKS

TRYING TO UNDERSTAND CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT ENDOGENOUS DMT DOES IS LIKE SPECULATING ABOUT SPACE FOR LACK OF AN ACTUAL
TELESCOPE MARVELING AT WHAT SEEMS RATHER THAN ACTUALLY TAPPING INTO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON

THIS ENTIRE SUBREDDIT OFTEN SEEMS LIKE A PLAYPEN OF SPECULATIVE BABBLE FOR LACK OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE

NO OFFENSE TO ANYBODY STUCK REVVING IN LOW GEAR BUT YOU HAVE TO STEP UP TO UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS

NOBODY EVER SAID THAT MONKEYS WITH RAZORS AND CREDIT CARDS ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE MYSTERIES OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY LOOKING AT IT FROM THE OUTSIDE WITHOUT ACTUALLY EATING EXTRA IMMERSING ONESELF AND RIGOROUSLY STUDYING THE STUFF THAT MAKES THEM TICK

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN EXPERIENCED ETC

AND THE WORD CONSCIOUSNESS CAN MEAN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS TO PEOPLE TO US IT MEANS THE SAME AS THE CHINESE WORD QI THE LIFE FORCE AUTONOMOUS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MAKES HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS POSSIBLE AND INTERESTING
TEXT MESSAGING IS TELEPATHY YOUR THOUGHTS INSTANTLY BEAMED TO SOMEONE DEVICE
THE NOTION OF TELEPATHY OR NON LOCAL CONSCIOUSNESS IS IN MOST ANCIENT CONTEMPLATIVE TRADITIONS SIDDHI POWERS FOR EXAMPLE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE BRIDGE BETWEEN MATERIAL SCIENCE AND THESE ANCIENT THEORIES OF MIND MAY BE IN STUDYING MIRROR NEURONS COULD BE THAT THESE SIDDHI PSYCHIC POWERS ARE SIMPLY TUNING THE MIND TO SUBTLE CUES IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE USUALLY OVERLOOKED BUT THERE IS POTENTIAL THAT IT IS MORE THAN THAT IM A BIT OF A ROMANTIC WHEN IT COMES TO THE POSSIBILITY OF PSYCHIC POWERS AS I LIKE TO THINK HUMANS HAVE THIS AMAZING POTENTIAL ALTHOUGH I ALSO REALIZE THAT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF THIS IS DIFFICULT TO COME BY USING OUR CURRENT MATERIALIST MODELS BUT AM HOPEFUL FOR ADVANCEMENT EVOLUTION OF THESE MODELS AS SCIENCE HAS SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS POTENTIAL
TELEPATHY IS PRECLUDED BY QUANTUM FIELD THEORY IF FIELD OR PARTICLE EXISTED THAT COULD INTERACT WITH THE ATOMS IN YOUR BRAIN WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY FOUND IT BY NOW
THAT WAS THROUGHLY ENJOYABLE I THINK THE STUDY OF MIND AS A PHILOSOPHICAL FIELD IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STUDY OF THE REST OF THE NATURAL WORLD IN THAT THE SCIENTIFIC TRADITION HAS NOTHING NOTHING CONCRETE TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT AS OPPOSED TO FOR EXAMPLE SAY COSMOLOGY IN WHICH THERE ARE DEFINITE HYPOTHESES AND ATTEMPTS TO GATHER EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT OR REFUTE THOSE HYPOTHESES THOUGH THE WESTERN SCIENTIFIC TRADITION IS STILL YET TO LAY DOWN THE FUNDAMENTAL DEFINITIONS ON WHICH IT COULD BUILD A THEORY OF MIND INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING OUT THAT MIND IS REDUCIBLE TO PHYSICAL OR BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THEORIES OF MIND ENJOY OLD AND WELL DEFINED NARRATIVES IN CONTINENTAL AND EASTERN PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITIONS EVIDENCE IN THESE TRADITIONS IS DRAWN FROM FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE WHICH THOUGH INSUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF SCIENCE MAY BE THE ONLY EVIDENCE AVAILABLE GIVEN THE CURIOUS AND SPECIAL NATURE OF THE SUBJECT
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALREADY ACCEPTED KNOWLEDGE TELEPATHY IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT HAS AND DOES OCCUR REGARDLESS I'M GLAD TO SEE THIS TOPIC STILL BEING DISCUSSED
I'VE EXPERIENCED TELEPATHY IT CERTAINLY EXISTS

IT WAS EXTENDED USE OF AYAHUASCA THAT ALLOWED ME TO SUBCONSCIOUSLY USE TELEPATHY ALBEIT IN A WEAK WAY

AN EXAMPLE IS WHEN I WAS HELPING A FRIEND MAKE MUFFINS OUT OF THE BLUE I IDLY WONDERED WHETHER BACON WHICH WASN'T ON THE BENCH AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS WOULD MAKE A GOOD COMBINATION AND MY FRIEND EYEBROWS RAISED ASKED WHY I THOUGHT OF THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT THE EXACT SAME THING AT THAT MOMENT IT BEING A FAVOURITE OF HERS

ALSO I HAD ANOTHER MINOR EXPERIENCE WHERE I WAS THINKING SEEMINGLY RANDOMLY ABOUT SOMETHING AND THE NEXT SECOND TO MY SHOCK SOMEONE VERBALIZED IT WAS I SUBCONSCIOUSLY PICKING UP ON THEIR THOUGHTS

I'VE ALSO COMMUNICATED WITH SPIRITS USING AYAHUASCA THEY DON'T USE LANGUAGE BUT SOMEHOW MY MIND WAS TRANSLATING THEIR RAW INTENTIONS INTO WORDS I COULD UNDERSTAND STILL NOT SURE HOW IT FULLY WORKS THOUGH

ANOTHER TIME I TRIED TELEPATHICALLY COMMUNICATING WITH A CROW IT WAS A VERY QUIET AFTERNOON AND I WAS SITTING QUIETLY ALBEIT CALLING LOUDLY MENTALLY WHEN THE NEIGHBOUR SAID SHUT UP I WAS CONFUSED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO NOISE SO I CALLED OUT MENTALLY TO THE CROW AGAIN AND AGAIN SHUT UP I STOPPED SHOCKED AND THE CROW STOPPED CALLING OUT AT THE EXACT SAME MOMENT AS ME LOL XD

SO ENOUGH DIRECT EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN ME THAT IT DOES EXIST BUT HOW CAN I REALLY EXPLAIN THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S NEVER HAD SUCH AN EXPERIENCE
HUMANS ARE SO FICKLE WE ALREADY HAVE SEVERAL FORMS OF TELEPATHY


DEPENDS HOW YOU DEFINE TELEPATHY

BODY LANGUAGE EMOTION INTUITION HAVE YOU EVER SAT NEXT TO OR ACROSS FROM SOMEONE LOOK AT THEIR FACE AND PICK UP SUBTLE HINTS IN THEIR BODY LANGUAGE INFORMATION IS EXCHANGED THAT REVEALS THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS EVERY HAD A SIGNIFICANT OTHER THAT YOU SPEND ALL DAY EVERY DAY WITH FAMILY MEMBERS YOU SENSE CHANGES IN THEM TELEPATHY

SPEECH THE HUMAN IS A SINGLE ORGANISM WITH IT'S BRAIN AS IT'S PREMIER CONTROLLER THE MOUTH IS JUST AN INTERMEDIATE CONDUIT OF THE MIND WE TAKE METAPHYSICAL THOUGHTS AND MANIFEST IT PHYSICALLY THROUGH THE MOUTH WHY DOES THAT TRANSLATION FROM SUDDENLY BREAKDOWN THE CONCEPT OF TELEPATHY IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THERE IS ALMOST AN INSIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WHETHER OUR COMMUNICATION INVOLVES SOUND WAVES OR NOT SPEECH IS TELEPATHY


BOOKS IT'S MORE OF A TEMPORAL ONE-SIDED TELEPATHY SOMEONE IN THE PAST PUT THEIR THOUGHTS DOWN ON PAPER NOW ANYONE IN THE PRESENT OR FUTURE CAN DIVE INTO THE MIND OF A WRITER THOUGH THE WRITER CANNOT ACTIVELY RECIPROCATE TELEPATHY

I HAVE THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD I TRANSLATE THEM TO ELECTRONIC TEXT AND SEND IT TO YOU WHEN YOU READ THE TEXT MESSAGE YOUR THOUGHTS ARE IMPLANTED INTO THE READERS BRAIN BACK AND FORTH UNSPOKEN OVER UNLIMITED DISTANCES INSTANTANEOUSLY HOW IS THAT NOT TELEPATHY TELEPATHY


WE'LL PROBABLY EVENTUALLY ACHIEVE THE IDEA OF TELEPATHY WHERE HUMANS CAN LOCK EYES AND HAVE FULLY ENGLISH CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER IN THEIR MINDS THIS WILL BE AIDED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY

BUT THIS IS JUST A LESS CUMBERSOME VERSION OF WHAT WE ALREADY DO WITH PHONES AND TEXT MESSAGING BUT I THINK MANY OF US WILL ACTUALLY PREFER TEXT MESSAGING FOR IT GIVES US THE OPTION TO DELAY OUR RESPONSE OR NOT RESPOND AT ALL AS WELL AS HAVING THE OPTION TO KEEP A WRITTEN RECORD AND OF COURSE SPEAKING WORKS JUST FINE

TELEPATHY IS ALL AROUND US WE JUST REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATCH WHAT WE IMAGINE ON TELEVISION
REMOVED
BEFORE I HEAR THIS PODCAST IS NOT TELEPATHY LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
I FEEL LIKE IM JUST READING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT JUST EXPLAINED DIFFERENTLY
I DON'T SEE THE EXAMPLE OF THE MURDERER AS A SOUND REFUTATION

IF WE REMEMBER THAT KANT WANTS US TO THINK OF MORALITY AS EQUAL TO EAST G PHYSICAL LAWS THEN THE MURDERER BY VIRTUE OF WANTING TO BE MURDEROUS HAS BROKEN THE FABRIC OF MORAL REASONING THEREFORE ANY CHOICE MAKING THAT FOLLOWS FROM THAT ISN'T LOGICALLY GROUNDED ANYMORE IT'S AS IF THE MURDERER HAS FLIPPED GRAVITY AND THEN EXPECTS YOU TO LOGICALLY BUILD SOMETHING WHILE STICKING TO THE USUAL WAY IN WHICH GRAVITY WORKS
WHY DO YOU GUYS POST THESE HERE JUST SO THE SUB HAS SOMETHING TO TEAR APART
DID HE CALL NATURAL LAW SUPERNATURAL
REMOVED
A PROFESSOR I HAD IN UNDERGRAD REFERRED TO CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE AS FOR UNDERGRADS

CAN ANYONE VENTURE A GUESS AS TO WHY THIS HAS ALWAYS PUZZLED ME
SALAY LZ EXPLAIN OR AT LEAST ASK YOUR SISTER
WISH I'D FOUND THIS BEFORE I TOOK MY EXAMS
WHAT IF I SAY THAT MY MAXIM IS CHECK ALL THESE STATISTICS ABOUT THE WORLD AND DO THE MOST UTILITARIAN THING POSSIBLE

IS THAT UNIVERSALIZABLE

CAN I SAY THAT I CAN LIE IF I TELL EVERYONE INVOLVED THE TRUTH LATER AND IF I AM FAIRLY SURE THAT THE LIE WILL CAUSE GOOD OTHERWISE

I DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO COMPLETELY RESPECT OWN MORAL JUDGEMENT BECAUSE IT COULD BE MENTAL ILLNESS OR SOMETHING AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESPECT THE VICTIM'S MORAL JUDGEMENT

DOES MERE MEANS HAPPEN WHEN THE PERSON DIDN'T CONSENT TO BEING MEANS WHAT IF I COULD GIVE PEOPLE FREEDOM WITH ONE PERSON BY SECRETLY USING THEM IN A TRIVIAL WAY

IS THE UNIVERSALIZABILITY PRINCIPLE A FORMULATION OF THE GOLDEN RULE
DETERMINISM WAS FIRST DISCOVERED BY THE SUMERIAN WHEN THEY NOTICED THE WANDERING STARS THROUGH THE FIXED CONSTELLATIONS HAD A MATHEMATICAL CERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR CYCLICAL RETURN IT WAS THOUGHT THE REALM OF HEAVENLY PERFECTION WAS AN ETERNAL COSMIC PRINCIPLE WHICH WHEN MIRRORED BY THE BODY SOCIAL WOULD BRING HARMONY AND ACCORD TO THE WORLD IT OUGHT TO BE NOTED THE UNEARTHLY WISDOM WAS ACCESSIBLE TO THE PRIESTLY CASTE ALONE FOR THE KNOWLEDGE WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE SCRIPT IN THE BEGINNING

FREE WILL WE FIRST ENCOUNTER IN THE RIG VEDAS WHEREBY THE WARRIOR CASTE WOULD NOT BE CONSTRAINED BY PRIESTLY DETERMINISTIC PRINCIPLES NIETZSCHE ALSO SAYS SOMETHING SIMILAR CONCERNING THE CHRISTIAN PRIESTHOOD AND FREE WILL THAT IS IT IS DEFINED WITHIN A TRANSCENDENT METAPHYSICS

I'M A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS OF COMPATIBILISM IF I'M HONEST AND MECHANIZED CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS ARISING FROM ONTOLOGICALLY MATERIALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS TO MY MIND WHAT IS SELF-EVIDENT IS CONTEMPORARY SCIENCES HAVE LITERALLY NO GROUND TO STAND ON AT ALL AND THIS IS SOMETHING HEIDEGGER REFERENCED TOO WITH HIS METAPHYSICAL NOTHING
GOOD READ TWO CENTS FROM THE TOP OF MY HEAD

PLEASE DON T USE THE MILLER TRANSLATION IT DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD TAYLOR AND WILLIAMS BOTH CRITICIZE IT FOR BEING MISGUIDING AND TOO METAPHYSICAL RESPECTIVELY I THINK YOU CAN FIND DUAL GERMAN ENGLISH OF PHENOMENOLOGY AS A PDF ON THIS SUB ACTUALLY

HEGEL S PREFACES WERE ALL PRETTY MUCH UNINTELLIGIBLE BECAUSE THEY WERE WRITTEN AFTER THE ARGUMENT THEY WERE WRITTEN AS THE END MORE THAN A BEGINNING THIS WAS NOT AN UNCOMMON PRACTICE BUT HEGEL MAKES IT A DEMONSTRATION
INTERVIEWER WHAT IS PHILOSOPHY

PHILOSOPHER CORRECT
CAN I JUST LAUGH I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT PHILOSOPHY IS

THIS GUY GETS US
ON A SIDE NOTE HOW IS HE A PHILOSOPHER EVEN
COMMON RESPONSES INCLUDED

WHAT IS PHILOSOPHY

WHAT IS

WHAT

AND THE NIHILISTS SAID NOTHING AT ALL


BERTRAND ANSWER
THERE'S NO WIDELY ACCEPTED CONCRETE DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPHY BUT THE GENERAL RESPONSES TO THAT QUESTION IS ESSENTIALLY CLUSTERED AROUND A FEW IDEAS

A SUMMATION OF WHICH MIGHT BE AS FOLLOWS

PHILOSOPHY IS THE STUDY OF THOUGHT AND KNOWLEDGE A STUDY INTO THE WHAT WHY AND THE HOW OF BELIEF IT IS A THAT IS INCORPORATED EITHER EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY INTO ALL OTHER BRANCHES OF STUDY AND SERVES TO ACT AS THE GLUE FOR ALL KNOWLEDGE



I'D BE CAREFUL IN ACCEPTING ANSWERS THAT TRY TO ACT AS THOUGH SCIENCE OR EVEN MATHEMATICS OR SIMILAR WERE SEPARATE BRANCHES OF STUDY GIVEN THAT THEY BOTH EMERGED FROM PHILOSOPHY AS SUB AREAS OF STUDY IT'S ONLY IN OUR MODERN AGE WHERE THE WHOLE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE IS SO VAST AND BROAD THAT PEOPLE CAN SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIVES IN SEPARATE BRANCHES AND NEVER DISCOVER IT ALL BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE ISN'T OR HASN'T BEEN SUBSTANTIAL PHILOSOPHICAL WORK DONE TO FIND OR CREATE THOSE BRANCHES IN THE FIRST PLACE
I ALWAYS LIKED DEFINITION PHILOSOPHY IS LEARNING HOW TO DIE
THERE IS A ROOM

THERE ARE PEOPLE INSIDE A ROOM

THE ROOM HAS A DOOR

A KNOCKING NOISE IS HEARD FROM THE DOOR

ALL THE PEOPLE INSIDE THE ROOM UNANIMOUSLY HEAR THE KNOCKING AND THEY ALL AGREE THAT SOMEONE HAS KNOCKED THE DOOR

THEY ALL START TO REASON WITH EACH OTHER AND ASK QUESTIONS AND GIVE ANSWERS ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THIS KNOCKER WHERE IS HE FROM WHATS HIS NAME WHAT HAS HE BROUGHT WITH HIM WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE HOW TALL IS HE WHAT'S HIS PURPOSE AND EVERY SINGLE DETAIL THAT COULD BE THOUGHT OF ABOUT THE NATURE OF THIS KNOCK

EACH ANSWER GIVEN HAS TO BE BACKED BY SOME MERIT OR LOGICAL BACKGROUND THAT SUPPORTS THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ANSWER AND THEY KEEP BUILDING UP ON EACH OTHERS ANSWERS VERIFYING EACH THOUGHT PROCESS THAT WENT INTO EACH CONCLUSION

THAT'S PHILOSOPHY


YET THEY CAN NEVER TRULY NEVER GET ALL THE EXACT DETAILS OF THE KNOCKER RIGHT WITHOUT ACTUALLY OPENING THE DOOR AND SEEING FOR THEIR SELVES ALTHOUGH THEY STILL CAN CORRECTLY VERIFY SOME OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE KNOCK THEY CAN DOCUMENT THE TIME OF THE KNOCK HOW MANY REPETITIONS AND THE LOUDNESS OF THE KNOCK AND ALL THE OTHER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES RELATED TO THE KNOCKING


IT'S LIKE A CAT SITUATION WHERE YOU ARE NEVER SURE IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER AS LONG AS THE BOX IS CLOSED BUT YOU CAN STILL HAVE A VERY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EXPERIMENT WORKS



THIS ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS A KNOCK OUR EXISTENCE IS A KNOCK WATER IS A KNOCK THE FOOD WE EAT IS A KNOCK BIRDS FLYING IN THE SKY ARE A KNOCK EVERYTHING WE OBSERVE WITH OUR SENSE IS A KNOCK


WE ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO PONDER AND HYPOTHESISE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THESE KNOCKS THE PROPERTIES THAT THEY BRING WITH THEM AND ALL THE SUBTLE INFORMATION THAT WE CAN EXTRACT FROM THEM

WHAT WE ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY ON OUR OWN IS THE IDENTITY OF THE KNOCKER NO MATTER HOW MUCH PHILOSOPHY WE GO THROUGH OUR ONLY WAY IS TO ALLOW THIS KNOCKER TO SPEAK FOR HIMSELF








MY ANSWER
AN EXPLORATION OF THE TRUTHS DISCOVERED THROUGH OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE ONWARD EXPLORATION OF WHAT MAY BE DISCOVERED NEXT

YOU CAN ASK YOURSELF THE SAME QUESTION FOR WHAT IS A PHILOSOPHER TO ME IT IS A RELATED QUESTION AND A COMPLEX ONE TOO

THE FIRST ANSWER FROM A PHILOSOPHER I RECEIVED FOR THIS IS WELL I THINK IT IS SOMEONE THAT CREATES COMPLEXITY THIS STILL MAKE ME LAUGH TO THIS DAY HOWEVER I DON'T THINK IT IS TOO FAR FROM THE TRUTH
WHAT IS PHILOSOPHY EXACTLY
I THINK IT'S LEARNING HOW TO GROW OLD
PHILOSOPHY IS ESSENTIALLY ABOUT REPROGRAMMING THE HUMAN MIND

ONCE IT WAS REALIZED THAT THE MODEL OF THE WORLD IN OUR HEADS IS MUTABLE AND ONLY AN ABSTRACTION OF REALITY OF DUBIOUS ACCURACY THEN IT FOLLOWED THAT ONE WOULD WORK TOWARD DECIDING WHICH MODEL OF THE WORLD WAS MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MODELS THAT WERE MOST REPRESENTATIVE OF REALITY SCIENCE THOSE THAT IMPART MENTAL STABILITY TO INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS PSYCHOLOGY SOCIOLOGY ETHICS AND I SUPPOSE METAPHYSICS AMONG OTHERS MODELS INVOLVING USEFUL REPRESENTATIONS OF HOW THE HUMAN MIND WORKS PSYCHOLOGY AND MORE RECENTLY NEUROBIOLOGY AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS I AM NO DOUBT NEGLECTING NATURALLY GREW OUT FROM THIS WORK OVER TIME

I THINK THAT IS WHY MANY PEOPLE HAVE DISDAIN FOR PHILOSOPHY AND WHY IT IS OFTEN A RATHER PAINFUL SERIOUS PURSUIT HOWEVER THE REWARDS FROM OVERTLY SELF-AWARE PHILOSOPHY PIONEERED IN ANCIENT GREECE I WOULD DESCRIBE RELIGION AS INTUITIVE PHILOSOPHY ARE PLAIN TO SEE INDEED IF ONE CARES TO GLANCE AT THE HISTORICAL RECORD

IT SEEMS AS THOUGH PHILOSOPHY CAN BE DESCRIBED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE DEVELOPED AS IT IS A PRECURSOR TO NEARLY ALL OTHERS DEPENDS ON IF YOU VIEW A CHIMPANZEE DECIDING HE CAN USE A STICK AS A WEAPON AS THE RESULT OF RUDIMENTARY PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT
MY POSITION IS THAT PHILOSOPHY IS THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH PARTICULARLY WHERE ITS TOUGHEST OF MOST UNCOMFORTABLE TO FIND
THE GREATEST CHALLENGE IN THIS I THINK IS PERSONAL DRIVE WHETHER IT IS A DRIVE TO ACCOMPLISH A TASK OR TO AFFIRM SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IT WILL NATURALLY NARROW YOUR FOCUS TO ONLY CONSIDER WHAT DOES NOT CONFLICT THAT DRIVE
WHAT PHILOSOPHY IS IS IN ITSELF A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION IT'S EXISTENCE PRECEDES ITS ESSENCE SO TO SPEAK PHILOSOPHY CODIFIED INTO A RIGID METHOD THAT STRUCTURES ITS ACTIVITY PRIOR TO THIS ACTIVITY ITSELF IS NO LONGER PHILOSOPHY THERE'S MANY PHILOSOPHIES AND PHILOSOPHY WILL KEEP INVENTING ITSELF
THIS WAS TRULY SOME OF THE MOST REFRESHING ONLINE READING MATERIAL I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME AND I THOUGHT I'D SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE

OFF TO PERUSE MY COPY OF THE ALEPH AFTER QUITE A WHILE
THANK YOU THIS IS A GREAT LIST
WHICH PODCAST SHOULD I USE I LIKE TO KNOW PHILOSOPHER'S PLAIN IDEAS WITHOUT PEOPLE INTERPRET IT
AS SOMEONE WHO'S NEW TO REDDIN AND HENCE THIS SUB AS WELL THIS WAS SO AWESOME TO FIND
BRAVO OP
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE SAY THAT CRASH COURSE IS BAD BUT I DON'T SEE WHY CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S SO BAD
I THINK HE MAKES THE INFORMATION CLEAR AND USES VISUALS TO EXPLAIN IT WELL
FINE ARTICLE OF BOOK I BUT IT REALLY DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT SOCRATES OR PLATAS JUSTICE BUT MORE OF WHAT IT IS NOT

TO EXPLAIN SOCRATES JUSTICE YOU NEED MORE THAN JUST BOOK I
THE WHOLE POINT OF BOOK I IS TO PRESENT DIFFERENT KINDS OF VIEWS ON JUSTICE TO START OF THE SEARCH OF HIS ACTUAL CONCEPTION
BESIDES THIS ARTICLE CONCLUDES THRASYMACHUS ACCOUNT IS DISPROVEN YET ADMITTEDLY ALMOST THE SAME ACCOUNT IS TAKING UP BY GLACON IN THE BEGINNING OF BOOK II THIS IS NOT REFUTED UNTIL THE END OF BOOK


MOST EXCELLENT
THE REPUBLIC IS GOOD TO READ JUSTICE N SHIT
FOR THE EXTREME OF INJUSTICE IS TO SEEM TO BE JUST WHEN ONE IS NOT SO THE PERFECTLY UNJUST MAN MUST BE GIVEN THE MOST PERFECT INJUSTICE AND NOTHING MUST BE TAKEN AWAY HE MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THE GREATEST INJUSTICES WHILE HAVING PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH THE GREATEST REPUTATION FOR JUSTICE AND IF HE SHOULD TRIP UP IN ANYTHING HE HAS THE POWER TO SET HIMSELF ARIGHT IF ANY OF HIS UNJUST DEEDS SHOULD COME TO LIGHT HE IS CAPABLE BOTH OF SPEAKING PERSUASIVELY AND OF USING FORCE TO THE EXTENT THAT FORCE IS NEEDED SINCE HE IS COURAGEOUS AND STRONG AND SINCE HE HAS PROVIDED FOR FRIENDS AND MONEY B

BASICALLY WHAT SOCRATES IS SAYING IS THAT TO BE JUST TAKES TIME MORALITY AND PERSEVERANCE HOWEVER TO BE UNJUST TAKES SHREWDNESS DECEPTIVENESS AND MANIPULATION

WHILE IT IS NOT EASY TO BE JUST IT IS JUST AS DIFFICULT TO BE UNJUST INSTEAD OF USING JUST AND UNJUST USE THE WORDS GOOD AND EVIL GOOD IS THE OPPOSITE OF EVIL BUT BOTH ARE NEEDED FOR PERFECT HARMONY

IT IS DIFFICULT IN OUR EVERYDAY LIFE TO BE A GOOD PERSON BUT THE GUILT ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION THAT BARES DOWN UPON THE UNJUST ALLOWS FOR AN ALMOST ADMIRABLE QUALITY AS WELL

THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE FAMOUS AND INFAMOUS THEY MEAN BASICALLY THE SAME BUT ONE HAS A BETTER CONNOTATION THAN THE OTHER
THIS BRINGS ME BACK TO A HIGH SCHOOL COARSE CALLED GREAT LOVES GREAT LOVERS NO MATTER HOW MUCH LOVE AND EFFORT I HAD I GOT A D
THIS STILL READS LIKE A FOREIGN LANGUAGE TO ME
THE GOOD MEN IS JUST BY NATURE JUST LIKE THE ILL MEN IS UNJUST BY NATURE QUESTION WHAT DO WE MEAN BY BY NATURE
THIS GUY GOT BANISHED BY PLATAS SUPPORTERS RIGHT
WORLD PHILOSOPHY DAY WAS CREATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION UNESCO TO CELEBRATE PHILOSOPHY AND PROMOTE THE IDEA THAT PHILOSOPHY IS A DISCIPLINE THAT ENCOURAGES CRITICAL AND INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND IS CAPABLE OF WORKING TOWARDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD AND PROMOTING TOLERANCE AND PEACE DAILY NOUS

TL W
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO CHRIS SURPRENANT UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS DISCUSSES THE ACCOUNT OF HUMAN WELL-BEING AND THE GOOD LIFE PRESENTED BY SOCRATES IN DIALOGUES HE EXPLAINS WHY SOCRATES CLOSELY CONNECTS HIS ACCOUNT OF THE GOOD LIFE WITH JUSTICE A CONCEPT UNDERSTOOD NOT JUST AS A POLITICAL ARRANGEMENT BUT ALSO AS A STATE OF A WELL-ORDERED INDIVIDUAL'S SOUL

THIS IS A BLOG POST BY ROY TENSE COOK CTA SCHOLAR OF THE COLLEGE AND PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES WHO WILL BE GIVING AN AMA HERE ON R PHILOSOPHY ON NOVEMBER SEE THE ANNOUNCEMENT POST HERE FOR MORE DETAILS BE SURE TO CHECK BACK AROUND THEN FOR LIVE Q A ON PHILOSOPHY OF LOGIC MATHEMATICS AND COMICS
THE INFAMOUS GODEL THEOREM HALTING PROBLEM ALL EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF LIE DETECTION
I THINK YOU MADE A LOT OF GOOD POINTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY NO TRULY OBJECTIONABLE POINTS I THINK LECTURES ON THE FUTURE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE RELEVANT TO WHAT FACILITATES THE UNFORTUNATE THINGS YOU DEPICT IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THEM YOU SHOULD CHECK THEM OUT
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES IT SEEM LIKE ZARATHUSTRA WAS AN EGOMANIAC WHO THOUGHT HIMSELF SUPERIOR AND LIKE UNTO A GOD ALL THE PLEBS SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM FOR HE HAS THE TRUTH AND NOTHING ELSE IS TRUE
HOW DOES THIS THEORY INTERACT WITH THE IDEA OF A CRAZY MAN WHO BY CHANCE COMES UP WITH THE MEMORIES AND WANTS OF SOMEONE ELSE SAY ABE LINCOLN THIS MAN WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVES THAT HE IS LINCOLN AND HAS MEMORIES AND MOTIVES IDENTICAL TO SOME THAT LINCOLN HAD THAT WERE BORN IN HIS INSANITY WOULDN'T THAT THEORY SAY THAT HE IS IN FACT LINCOLN DUE TO HIS NARRATIVE BEING THE SAME AS ABE NARRATIVE

I GUESS AS A SIMPLIFYING CASE WHAT IF THERE WERE TWO OLD CRAZY PEOPLE THAT WANDER INTO AN INSANE ASYLUM OFF OF THE STREETS NEITHER OF THEM HAVE ANYONE WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE EITHER OF THEM AT THE MOMENT THEY WALK IN THEY BOTH REMEMBER NOTHING BUT THAT THEIR NAME IS TOM AND THEY BOTH WANT NOTHING BUT TO LAY DOWN AND GO TO SLEEP THOSE NARRATIVES ARE IDENTICAL ARE THEY THE SAME PERSON

I'M INEXPERIENCED IN PHILOSOPHY AND ONLY REMEMBER THIS IDEA FROM AN INTRODUCTORY PHILOSOPHY LECTURE THAT I TOOK A YEAR AGO SO I'M SORRY IF THERE'S A SIMPLE ANSWER HERE THAT I'M MISSING OR A NAME TO THIS ARGUMENT THAT I DON'T KNOW
IT MAY BE A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING PERSONAL IDENTITY THE VIDEO IS WORTH WATCHING
BUT
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A NUMBER OF STORIES TOLD ABOUT ME
I AM GOING TO DIE ALONE AND AS A FAILURE THAT'S MY LIFE STORY

IF YOU FOUND THIS VIDEO INTERESTING AND YOU WANT MORE DETAIL ON THE PERSPECTIVE GALEN PAPER AGAINST NARRATIVITY PDF IS A GREAT READ
AS SENSE MAKING CREATURES WE CREATE MEANING OUT OF NOTHING TO SATISFY OUR EMOTIONAL NEEDS THIS IS WHAT I GOT OUT OF THIS VIDEO DOES THAT SUM IT UP ABOUT RIGHT
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT KIND OF SOFTWARE THEY USE TO MAKE THAT KIND OF EXPLAINER VIDEO I NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE DRAWINGS WERE REUSED THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO THE END RESULT LOOKS REALLY GOOD AND APPEARS TO NOT REQUIRE ACTUALLY FILMING SOMEONE DRAW ANYONE KNOW HOW THEY DO THAT
MY THOUGHTS I THINK WE'RE NEVER COMPLETELY CONSCIOUS OF WHO WE ARE I BELIEVE PEOPLE HAVE OPINIONS ON WHO THEY ARE AND WHICH OF THEIR TRAITS ARE THE MOST DEFINING OF THEIR IDENTITY WHICH DERIVE DIRECTLY FROM THEIR VALUES WHICH ALSO MAY CHANGE OVER TIME

WE MAY BE MANY THINGS LEFT UNTOLD IN OUR BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PICK POINTS TO BE PRESENTED IN THE STORY AND ALSO BECAUSE WE MAY NOT BE CONSCIOUS OF IMPORTANT FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE OUR BEHAVIOR
I LIKED THE BABY SAYING IT IS STRAIGHT FORWARD WHENEVER I SEE A NEWBORN I AM ALWAYS ENVIOUS HOW MUCH LIES AHEAD RATHER THAN BEHIND

UNFORTUNATELY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF LIFE WE ARE ALL EXPOSED TO BOTH BAD AND GOOD EXPERIENCES SO OPERATING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE A SELF NARRATIVE I WANT MINE FROM WHEN I WAS ONE AND HALF YEARS OLD

I COULD EAT WALK TALK AND I THOUGHT THE CAT WAS THE COOLEST
THANKS VERY INTERESTING BTW WHO ILLUSTRATED
THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT GETS FROM A PURELY HUMANISTIC PERSPECTIVE THANKFULLY THERE IS A MUCH BIGGER PICTURE WHICH THE AUTHOR TOUCHES ON BUT IS CAREFUL TO STAY AWAY FROM OUR LIVES ARE COMPLETELY UNIQUE IS SPITE OF OUR MANY COMMONALITIES AND WE KNOW THIS WHY BECAUSE WE ARE FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE AND OUR LIVES ARE GIVEN MEANING AND VALUE BEYOND OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PROPERTIES AND WAY BEYOND THE STORY WE LIVE WHICH SO OFTEN ATTEMPTS TO DEFINE US THERE IS SOMETHING MORE BECAUSE YOU ARE SOMETHING MORE
IDENTITY IS A USEFUL CONCEIT IN FACT NEITHER YOU NOR I EXIST IN ANY OF THE WAYS PHILOSOPHERS JUGGLE MUCH LIKE THE BEST A MAP MAKER CAN CREATE IS A MORE OR LESS USEFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE WORLD AND NOT THE WORLD ITSELF
SO WHAT IF SOMEONE GETS AMNESIA
REMOVED
THIS IS EXPLAINS EXACTLY HOW I COMPREHEND THE IDEA OF SELF CONCEPT
WE ALL MAKE CHOICES BUT IN THE END OUR CHOICES MAKE US
THE THING IS IF THERE IS A STORY ABOUT YOU TO BE TOLD THAT MEANS YOU ARE NOT YOURSELF AND YOUR LIFE IS A NOT A REAL THING STORIES ARE BY ESSENCE REDUCTIVE
MAYBE BEING HUMAN IS JUST WEARING A MASK THINKING IT'S YOUR FACE
THE VIDEO REFERENCES THE IDEA OF RAGS TO RICHES AS BEING A WESTERN IDEAL WHAT IDEALS DO THE REST OF THE WORLD HAVE IN OTHER WORDS WHAT DO EUROPEANS FOR EXAMPLE DEEM AS ACTUALIZED
MAYBE ALSO MY MOM AND MY FRIEND RICHARD WILL HAVE DIFFERENT STORIES ABOUT MY COLLEGE YEARS
OVER TIME STORIES CHANGE PRESUMABLY THE PAST ME DOESN'T

I LIKE HOW SHE POINTS OUT WE ARE WHAT WE CARE ABOUT THE THEORIES OF METAPHYSICS ARE INTERESTING BUT FEEL CHAOTIC AND DON'T OFFER ANYTHING CONCRETE IF YOU PUT TIME AND EFFORT INTO ENOUGH THINGS ONE OR MAYBE A FEW OF THEM WILL WORK AND IT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY
IT IS FUNNY THAT LIFE IS ALWAYS DEFINED AS WHAT HAPPENED IN IT THAT WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY

WHEN YOU THINK OF EINSTEIN YOU THINK OF HIS THEORIES OR OTHER BITS THAT ADD BACKGROUND VALUE TO HIS THEORIES STORIES ABOUT HIS MOTHER HIS TEACHER ETC YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT HIS TEACHER IF HE HADNT PRODUCED HIS THEORIES

SIMILARLY WHEN WE MEET PEOPLE WE TELL THEM WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT RATHER THAN WHAT MAKES US COMMON WHERE DO I WORK WHERE DID I GROW UP WHAT DO I DO IN MY SPARE TIME

NOBODY DOES ASK YOU WHAT TOOTHPASTE DO YOU USE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF FATHERHOOD WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE TASTE OF WATER WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOUR UNLESS OF COURSE THE QUESTION SUPPLEMENTS A BIGGER DISCUSSION

SO OTHERS PERCEIVE US BASED ON OUR DIFFERENCES WHILE YOU PERCEIVE YOURSELF ON THE WHOLE YOU HAVE A PHILOSOPHY TO LIFE IN EVERY THING THE MOTIONS YOU FOLLOW TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH THE RISKS YOU ACCEPT WHEN DRIVING THE TYPE OF FOOD YOU LIKE TO EAT IN THE MORNING THE WAY YOU APPROACH STRANGERS THE WAY YOU CLIMB A SET OF STAIRS THE WAY YOU CATCH ANY TYPE OF BALL ETC

THAT PART OF YOUR LIFE IS ONLY KNOWN TO YOU UNLESS OTHERS NOTICE IT AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES YOU

NOT THE HIGHLIGHTS OF YOUR LIFE NOT THE WOMAN YOU MARRIED OR THE DEGREE YOU GOT BUT IN ALL THE PECULIARITIES OF YOUR LIFE THAT NOBODY KNOWS BUT YOU

THE DOWNSIDE OF PEOPLE KNOWING OUR PECULIARITIES IN DETAIL IS THAT OUR DEATH WOULD HAVE LITTLE TO NO EFFECT ON THEM YOU ALREADY EXIST IN THEIR MIND AND YOU ARE REPLICATABLE THROUGH IMAGINATION THAT IS WHY A CHILD CRAVES THEIR PARENTS MORE WHEN THEY ARE YOUNGER BUT PULLS AWAY FROM THEM WHEN HE THINKS HE HAS THEM FULLY FIGURED OUT

AND THAT IS WHY MY BELIEF IN GOD IS STRONG BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT HE KNOWS ME BETTER THAN MYSELF TO EVEN THE MOST MINUTE PECULIARITY THAT RESIDES IN MY SUBCONSCIOUS
PERCEPTION IS REALITY AND WE ALL DEFINE OUR OWN OTHERWISE THIS LIFE STORY WOULD BE TOO SAD TO LIVE
BLACK OUTS AMNESIA SORRY NEXT THIS HAS BEEN DISPROVEN MANY MANY TIMES SINCE LOCKE
NOT GOING TO WATCH IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO AT THE MOMENT BUT WHAT COULD THE APPLICATIONS OF THIS BE IF SOMEONE SAID I AM NOBODY
WOULD WOULD THIS MEAN FOR THE PERSON
REMOVED
REMOVED
MY IDENTITY CANNOT BE REALIZED BECAUSE OF THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY LIFE WHICH NOBODY BELIEVES WHICH HAS ALLOWED TO SOME DEGREE MY MIND ITS OWN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE REALITY AND HOW I PERCEIVE MYSELF
REMOVED
DEAR PHILOSOPHY

I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND ME

SINCERELY THOUGHTS
RATHER REMINDS ME OF THIS QUOTE

THE MASSES HAVE NEVER THIRSTED AFTER TRUTH THEY TURN ASIDE FROM EVIDENCE THAT IS NOT TO THEIR TASTE PREFERRING TO DEIFY ERROR IF ERROR SEDUCE THEM WHOEVER CAN SUPPLY THEM WITH ILLUSIONS IS EASILY THEIR MASTER WHOEVER ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY THEIR ILLUSIONS IS ALWAYS THEIR VICTIM AN INDIVIDUAL IN A CROWD IS A GRAIN OF SAND AMID OTHER GRAINS OF SAND WHICH THE WIND STIRS UP AT WILLIAM GUSTAVE LE BON
KIERKEGAARD WAS QUOTED IN REFERENCE TO THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH WE ALSO HAVE A FREEDOM TO WISE SILENCE BUT FEW EXERCISE THIS RIGHT QUOTE NOT VERBATIM
I ALWAYS LOVED KIERKEGAARD ON THE CROWD NOWHERE IN THE BIBLE IS IT WRITTEN LOVE THE CROWD

MORE RELEVANT TODAY WITH HIGHLY PARTISAN POLITICS AND BOTH SIDES ATTEMPTING TO DEHUMANIZE THEIR OPPONENTS
THE CENTRAL POINT ABOUT BEING HUMAN IS THAT THE UNIT IS THE HIGHEST COUNTS FOR LESS

WHAT AN ELOQUENT THOUGHT
HIS THOUGHTS ON THE CROWD GO MUCH DEEPER KIERKEGAARD HAD THE SOPHISTICATION TO UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES IMPARTED BY THE PRINTED WORD AS IT APPEARED IN THE NEWS PAPER AND OTHER MEDIA AT HIS TIME SPECIFICALLY IT WAS THE ARTIFICIAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE PUBLIC IN COLLUSION W THE HYPERCENTRALIZATION OF STATES AS GOVERNMENT A NOTION ABSENT IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE BEFORE PRINT THAT GAVE PERMISSION FOR THE MOST INSIDIOUS FORMS OF MODERN GROUP THINK
THIS THREAD IS CROWDED WITH TOO MANY INDIVIDUALS
LIFE CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD BACKWARDS BUT IT MUST BE LIVED FORWARDS THIS MEANS EVERYONE HAS A HAPPY LIFE IN THE END IF YOU REWIND YOUR LIFE STORY
EH I DON'T KNOW TRUTH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT IT IS BELIEVED BY THE CROWD OR EVEN IF IT IS AN OPINION THAT THE CROWD SUBSCRIBE TO IN SOME MANNER OTHER THAN ACTUAL BELIEF OR WHETHER IT IS THE LONELY OPINION OF THE BRAVE INDIVIDUAL TRUTH IS THE RELATION BETWEEN AN OPINION AND THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE MIND SIMPLY BEING POPULAR DOES NOT MAKE A BELIEF UNTRUE SIMPLY BEING ARRIVED AT BY THE EARNEST COGITATIONS OF THE BRAVE INDIVIDUAL IN SOLITUDE IS NO GUARANTEE IT IS NOT FALSE
THIS ALSO APPEARS TO BE AN ARGUMENT FOR HUMANITARIANISM THAT THOSE WHO TURN A BLIND EYE BECAUSE THEY ARE BENEFITING FROM THOSE WHO SUFFER UNDER THEM ARE WEAK AND HE STATES HE WILL PROTEST TO SHOW THEM THE SUFFERING OF OTHERS IT SEEMS PERHAPS I AM INTERPRETING IT WRONG
IT'S A GOOD READ I'M ON THE SECOND TO LAST LEMMA I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THIS ONE

INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT SO CORRUPT THAT THEY ACTUALLY WISH TO DO EVIL BUT THEY ARE BLINDED AND DON T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING IT IS ALL A MATTER OF BAITING THEM FOR DECISIVE ACTION A CROWD TRIUMPHS IF ONE CEDES THE WAY STEPS ASIDE SO THAT IT NEVER COMES TO REALIZE WHAT IT IS DOING A CROWD HAS NO ESSENTIAL VIEWPOINT THEREFORE IF IT HAPPENS TO KILL A MAN IT IS EO IPSO HALTED IT PAYS HEED AND COMES TO ITS SENSES

INDIVIDUALS DOESN'T READ CORRECTLY DOES ANYONE THINK THEY MEANT CROWD DID I NOT COMPREHEND CORRECTLY WHAT WAS SAID

EDIT 2 I UNDERSTAND NOW THEY MEANT INDIVIDUALS AS IN THE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAKE UP A CROWD AND NOT THEE INDIVIDUAL AS IN THE INDIVIDUAL VS CROWD

EDIT JUST WANT TO ADD THAT I UNDERSTOOD THE MAJORITY OF WHAT KIERKEGAARD STATES AND IF THE ABOVE IS CLEARED I WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING I'M PLEASED WITH MYSELF

INCREDIBLY INTERESTING BBC RADIO DOCUMENTARY THAT LOOKS AT CROWDS AND THE PERCEPTION OF THEM I TEND TO AGREE WITH THE VIEW OF THE THE DOCUMENTARY MAKERS THAT IDEA OF THE CROWD WHILST IT DOES MAKE SENSE IS SOMEWHAT SIMPLISTIC
IMO IT IS WRONG AT THE FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL MEMBERS OF THE CROWD DO HAVE AGENCY
KIERKEGAARD GOD DAMN I REMEMBER READING HIM IN FRESHMAN YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL OVER THE SUMMER I WAS STILL SUPER CONFUSED BY THE END OF IT LOL BUT I ACTUALLY LIKED ON THE CROWD IT WAS RELEVANT THEN IT IS STILL RELEVANT NOW
SO BASICALLY IF WE TRANSFER THIS TO THE US ELECTIONS TRUMP HAS THE TRUTH SINCE HE'S IN THE MINORITY OF THE POPULAR VOTE
BUT SHE WON THE POPULAR VOTE
EVENT DESCRIPTION

DOES PERCEPTION GIVE ME ANY REASON TO BELIEVE IN AN EXTERNAL WORLD OR COULD I BE A BRAIN IN A VAT THAT IS FED INFORMATION BY A MALICIOUS OR BENEVOLENT SCIENTIST AND IF I WERE SUCH A BRAIN COULD I EVER SAY OR THINK THIS THIS IS JUST ONE PUZZLE RAISED BY THE HARVARD PHILOSOPHER HILARY PUTNAM WHO DIED LAST YEAR THOUGH ITS ORIGINS ARE IN AUGUSTINE AND DESCARTES PUTNAM REVOLUTIONISED ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF KNOWLEDGE LANGUAGE AND THE MIND WE BRING TOGETHER A DISTINGUISHED PANEL TO DISCUSS HIS LIFE AND WORK

CHOMSKY SAYS THAT CHOICES ARE UNCONSCIOUS AND THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE FREE WILL BY PHENOMENOLOGICAL REFLECTION HOW ARE THESE TWO THINGS COMPATIBLE

ALSO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTELLIGIBILITY OF THE WORLD AND INTELLIGIBILITY OF THEORETICAL EXPLANATIONS OF THE WORLD
IS DR CHOMSKY AWARE OF THE USE OF HIS NAME IN THIS ILLUSTRATION WHICH MORPHS THE FREE WILL DISCUSSION INTO AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEMONSTRATION

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF VOICE
SINCE ALMOST NONE OF THE DISCUSSION RESPONDS TO THE CONTENT OF THE ARTICLE BUT INSTEAD RIFFS OFF OF THE TITLE AND BECAUSE OF THE VERY HIGH PROPORTION OF BAD COMMENTS THIS THREAD HAS NOW BEEN LOCKED FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION
THIS REMINDS ME OF AN INTERESTING CASE WE HAD HERE IN NORWAY A FEW YEARS BACK SEX WORK IS LEGAL IN NORWAY BUT PIMPING AND BUYING SEX IS ILLEGAL

ONE DAY A SEX WORKER SHOWED UP AT THE TAX OFFICE WITH ABOUT DOLLARS IN CASH DEMANDING HER CIVIL RIGHT TO PAY TAXES THE TAX OFFICE COULD FIND NO LEGAL MEANS OF ACCEPTING HER MONEY IN THE END THE CASE WOUND UP IN THE SUPREME COURT WHERE IT WAS DEEMED UNLAWFUL FOR THE STATE TO ACCEPT THE MONEY BECAUSE OF HOW THE RELEVANT LAW WAS PHRASED DOING THIS WOULD MAKE THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT A PIMP

THUS SEX WORKERS IN NORWAY ARE DENIED BOTH THEIR DUTY AND THEIR RIGHT TO PAY TAXES

WHILE I AGREE WITH SINGER ON THIS IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SLOW DAY FOR HIM AS THIS IS A SOFTBALL TOPIC I WONDER IF HE HAS A QUOTA FOR ARTICLES TO MAINTAIN HIS POSITION AT PRINCETON

USUALLY HE IS POSITING ARGUMENTS LIKE TO PARAPHRASE EUGENICS WILL BE A NATURAL OUTCOME OF SOCIETY WITH GENETIC ENGINEERING BUT ONLY THE RICH WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT I EAST THE RICH WILL HAVE PERFECT HEALTHY BABIES AND THE POOR WILL HAVE GENETICALLY INFERIOR CHILDREN THAT THE RICH WOULD HAVE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED IN UTERO

I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THE POSTING AND COMMENTING RULES REGARDING THIS BUT FOR A SMALLER GROUP OF YOU THAT UNDERSTAND SPANISH YOU MAY FIND THIS ARTICLE AND THIS VIDEO INTERESTING THEY REFER TO A SELF APPOINTED ARGENTINEAN FEMINIST WHORE WHO IS A THAT DEFENDS THE RIGHTS OF SEX WORKERS FROM A FEMINIST STANDPOINT THAT I FOUND VERY ENLIGHTENING HER APPROACH IS VERY PRACTICAL POINTING OUT THE LACK OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WORK OF A MAID WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEAT OF HER BACK AND THE WORK OF A WHO WORKS WITH THE SWEAT OF OUR VAGINAS TRANSLATED BY ME FOR EXAMPLE AND IT PUTS IN MORE PRACTICAL TERMS SOME OF SINGER S ARGUMENTS I HOPE YOU FIND IT INTERESTING
WHY DOES THE ARTICLE PLACE SUCH A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION TO FEMINISM IS IT JUST ME PICKING THIS UP IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT WHEN LOOKING AT CERTAIN SITUATIONS ISN'T IT FEMINIST IC OF THE AUTHOR TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE SAFETY OF THE SEX WORKERS

THE AUTHOR IS ALL OVER THE PLACE

I QUOTE THE ORIGINAL IMPETUS FOR THE LEGALIZATION OF THE SEX INDUSTRY IN NEW SOUTH WALES WAS AN INQUIRY INTO POLICE CORRUPTION THAT SHOWED THAT THE SEX INDUSTRY WAS A MAJOR SOURCE OF POLICE BRIBES LEGALIZATION ENDED THAT IN A SINGLE STROKE

SO IT WASN'T THE MOTIVATION TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SEX WORKERS BUT RATHER SEX WORKERS SAFETY IS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE A GOOD ONE FROM TRYING TO SOLVE POLICE CORRUPTION INSTEAD DID I READ THAT RIGHT AND THE AUTHOR GOES IN THE END TALKING ABOUT ENDING PREJUDICES WHAT AM I MISSING

IT S NOT A CRAZY CHOICE CONTRARY TO STEREOTYPES OF PAID SEX WORK IN A LEGAL BROTHEL IS NOT ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS OR HAZARDOUS TO ONE S HEALTH SOME SEX WORKERS VIEW THEIR PROFESSION AS INVOLVING GREATER SKILL AND EVEN A MORE HUMAN TOUCH THAN ALTERNATIVE JOBS OPEN TO THEM THEY TAKE PRIDE IN THEIR ABILITY TO GIVE NOT ONLY PHYSICAL PLEASURE BUT ALSO EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO NEEDY PEOPLE WHO CANNOT GET SEX ANY OTHER WAY

HE GOES FROM TALK ABOUT HOW IT IS NOT ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS TO TALKS OF THEM TAKING CARE OF THESE LONELY PATRONS

WELL I DO THAT TOO AS A WAITRESS BY SIMPLY BEING KIND ATTENTIVE MAKING EYE CONTACT SMILING CHECKING ON THEM AND LASTLY CONVERSING WITH THEM ABOUT THEIR WORK FAMILY AND RANDOM STORIES IT'S SHARING ANECDOTES JOKES AND CONNECTING FORTUNATELY THEY ARE NOT DRUNK OR DRUGGED UP THE ONES WHO ARE I STAY AWAY FROM AND KEEP IT BASIC THAT'S HOW I ENSURE MY SAFETY

MY POINT IN HERE IS THAT HE HAS NO PROOF FOR THAT CLAIM THAT'S NOT ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS OR HAZARDOUS DID I MISS THE SOURCE HOW DO YOU EVEN MEASURE THAT AND OTHER POINT IS THE AUTHOR MAKES IT SOUND SO NICE THAT SEX WORKERS GIVE ALSO EMOTIONAL SUPPORT OF COURSE IT FEELS GOOD TO BE KIND TO PEOPLE BUT TRUST ME THEY WOULDN'T BE DOING IT IF NOT FOR THE MONEY SAME AS WHEN I'M WAITRESSING HE MAKES IT SOUND WHAT'S THE WORD SO NICE HE'S STATING THE OBVIOUS NOTHING NEW PEOPLE WANT PERSONAL ATTENTION WHEN LONELY SO WHAT WHAT ABOUT SAFETY AGAIN GO BACK TO THAT
DON'T HAVE ANY PHILOSOPHY BACKGROUND SO DON'T REALLY POST HERE BUT SEX WORK IS NOT A CONSENSUS TERM BY ANY MEANS

PEOPLE WHO WANT TO NORMALIZE USE SEX WORK PEOPLE WHO DON'T USE PROSTITUTION AND AMONG THOSE WHO USE PROSTITUTION THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF ATTITUDES REGARDING THE ACTUAL PRACTICE

TO JUST DISMISS IT AS A PEJORATIVE TERM IS LAZY TO SAY THE LEAST SEMANTICS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY IMPORTANT HERE
MYTHS ABOUND PERHAPS NO OTHER TOPIC SEES ARGUMENTS ON ALL SIDES BEING CONDUCTED BY MYTHOLOGIZING THE FACTS TO BUILD STORIES WHICH SUPPORT THEIR CLAIMS ADD TO THIS A LEVEL OF HYPOCRITICAL MORALIZING AND WE GET A VOLATILE MIX

PROFESSOR SINGER CERTAINLY ENGAGES IN THE MYTHOLOGIZING WHEN HE ASKS THE FOLLOWING QUESTION FACED WITH THE PROSPECT OF MONOTONOUS REPETITIVE WORK FOR EIGHT HOURS A DAY ON AN ASSEMBLY LINE OR FLIPPING HAMBURGERS THEY PREFER THE HIGHER PAY AND SHORTER HOURS THAT THE SEX INDUSTRY OFFERS MANY MAY NOT MAKE THAT CHOICE BUT SHOULD WE MAKE CRIMINALS OF THOSE WHO DO

AND HERE LIES THE MYTHOLOGIZING IT'S LIKE THE AND CENTURY PAINTINGS OF ROBUST LOOKING PEASANTS HAPPILY AT WORK IN THE FIELD ENJOYING THE BEAUTIFUL DAY THESE PAINTINGS WERE PROPAGANDA FOR THEIR WEALTHY OWNERS I CAN PAT MYSELF ON THE BACK FOR HAVING HAPPY HEALTHY PEASANTS AS SERVANTS

SO HERE'S ONE MYTH FOR THOSE WANTING DECRIMINALIZATION OR LEGALIZATION OF PROSTITUTION I MEET THIS YOUNG WOMAN SHE'S WORKING AS AN INTERN FOR THIS COMPANY AS SHE SUPPORTS HERSELF THROUGH SCHOOL SHE'S REALLY BRIGHT HAS HER ACT TOGETHER BUT LET ME KNOW SHE'S STRUGGLING TO COVER THE COSTS OF TUITION SHE'S ALSO REALLY HOT I'LL OFFER TO PAY HER TUITION AND IN RETURN I'LL GET TO GET INTO HER PANTS SHE HAPPILY AGREES THIS ALLOWS HER TO QUIT HER OTHER EVENING JOB AS A WAITRESS AND ALLOWS HER TO FOCUS ON HER STUDIES

HOW COULD THAT BE ILLEGAL IT'S A FOR THE BOTH OF US RIGHT I MEAN ASSUMING SHE GIVES FULL CONSENT SHE'LL PROBABLY BE HAPPIER YES SHE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE TIME TO STUDY SHE'LL HAVE LESS STRESS ABOUT HER BILLS SHE'LL PURSUE HER CAREER MORE FREELY I'VE REALLY HELPED HER OUT HERE RIGHT THE VALUE I'VE DELIVERED TO HER IS FAR GREATER THAN THE MOMENTARY PLEASURE I'VE RECEIVED AS SUCH YOU SHOULD BE GIVING ME AN AWARD FOR MY ACT OF BENEVOLENCE HERE FOR SO VERY LITTLE BACK I'VE MADE THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S LIFE SO MUCH BETTER

SIGH

SHALL WE CONTINUE THE MYTH OK I NOT ONLY HELPED HER OUT SHE WAS ALSO VERY IN TO OLDER GUYS SHE FINDS THEM AND THEREFORE ME MORE MATURE SHE'S NOT INTO ROCKSTAFF LOOKS SHE'S INTO OLD GUY LOOKS SHE LIKES BEDDING A GUY WHO IS MORE THAN YEARS HER SENIOR AND IT ACTUALLY TURNS HER ON TO BE DOING IT FOR MONEY

HOW DARE WE SAY SHE'S DONE SOMETHING ILLEGAL HER LIFE WAS MADE IMMEASURABLY BETTER WE NEED MORE SUCH CASES RIGHT

SIGH MAYBE THERE ARE SUCH WOMEN IN THE REAL WORLD THE TRUTH IS USUALLY MUCH DIFFERENT WOMEN GENERALLY DON'T LIKE OR WANT TO BED MEN WHO ARE OLDER THAN THEIR FATHERS WHEN THEY DO SO FOR MONEY IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY ARE PRETTY DESPERATE FOR THAT MONEY AND REALLY DON'T HAVE OTHER MEANS TO GET IT

I'M SURE THERE ARE A FEW WOMEN OUT THERE THAT DO IT JUST TO AFFORD REALLY EXPENSIVE SHOES BUT SUCH EXCEPTIONS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN EXCEPTIONS TO THE REAL FACTS

IN MY HYPOTHETICAL I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A WOMAN'S DESPERATION DESPERATION SO GREAT SHE'S WILLING TO OBEY THE SEXUAL WHIMS OF A GUY WHO FINDS SEXUAL SATISFACTION IN TREATING WOMEN AS NOTHING MORE THAN A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE SEXUAL SATISFACTION THROUGH THE CONTROLLING OF THAT WOMAN THROUGH THE POWER HE HAS OVER THAT WOMAN PAINTING MYSELF AS A SAVIOR TO HER IS PROPAGANDA IT'S A COMPLETE MYTHOLOGY SINGER CHARACTERIZING IT AS SAVING HER FROM HOURS ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE IS EXACTLY THE SAME THIS IS NOT MY IDEA OF A SAVIOR

LET'S GENERALIZE WHY IS THIS ALMOST ALWAYS ABOUT MEN BUYING WOMEN ALMOST ALL THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SEX TRADE HAVE THE COMMON ELEMENT THAT THEY ARE PROBLEMS FOR WOMEN I'M HOPING SOMEONE HERE FINDS THIS A TAD TROUBLING

I'M SURE THERE ARE CASES WHERE THERE IS A WOMAN WHO IS A HAPPY PROSTITUTE WHO PREFERS IT TO OTHER PROFESSIONS GREAT WHO CARES LET'S DEAL WITH OF THE OTHER CASES YOU KNOW I'M GREAT AT DRIVING DRUNK BUT WE DON'T CHANGE THE LAWS ON DRINKING AND DRIVING BECAUSE I'M THE EXCEPTION THAT PROVES THE RULE FINDING A CASE WHERE THE YOUNG WOMAN IS HAPPY BEING A PROSTITUTE SAVED FROM THE HOURS ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE SHOULDN'T EVER HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC POLICY HERE

LET'S DEAL WITH THE ABUSE WOMEN FACE FROM THE SEX TRADE FROM THEIR CLIENTS TO THEIR PIMPS

I SAY THIS ALL WITHOUT TAKING AN ACTUAL STAND ON WHETHER IT SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE LEGALIZED OR DECRIMINALIZED ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT THIS ARGUMENT FROM PROFESSOR SINGER IS A BAD ONE

WILL DECRIMINALIZING OR LEGALIZING MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR WOMEN MAYBE LET'S EXAMINE PROFESSOR SINGER POINTS OUT THAT THE DEMAND IS THERE HOW WILL THIS EFFECT SUPPLY

WILL PIMPS DISAPPEAR NOT A CHANCE PROSTITUTION REMAINS A POWER GAME MOSTLY OF MEN OVER WOMEN A PIMP IS THERE FOR THE MONEY AS LONG AS MONEY IS THERE THERE WILL BE MEN TRYING TO PUT WOMEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY HAVE THEM UNDER CONTROL

WILL WOMEN BE MORE LIKELY TO COME FORWARD AGAINST THEIR ABUSIVE PIMPS MAYBE JUST A TINY BIT BUT THE FACT IS WOMEN TODAY DON'T GET THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE IF THEY DO COME FORWARD IN SUCH SITUATIONS WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME A PROSTITUTE WAS PUNISHED FOR COMING FORWARD AGAINST HER PIMP

IT IS AGAIN SOMETHING OF A MYTH THAT SUDDENLY THE GAME CHANGES FOR WOMEN HERE BY LEGALIZATION OR DECRIMINALIZATION THE FACT IS THE WINNERS IN BOTH WOULD BE PIMPS AND THE CLIENTS THESE ARE THE PLAYERS AT MOST RISK IN COMMITTING CRIMINAL ACTS THEY ARE NOW BEING GIVEN A GREEN LIGHT ON THEIR ACTIONS

THERE IS NO DOUBT VIEWS ON PROSTITUTION ARE CHANGING THE INTERNET IS HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE PROFESSION IT'S NOT REALLY A PROFESSION BUT LET'S NOT GET INTO THAT DEBATE IN TERMS OF MAKING IT EASIER TO FIND BOTH WILLING WOMAN AND INTERESTED CLIENT

BUT THE MYTH OF THE HANDSOME WELL OFF MAN HAVING PASSIONATE SEX WITH THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN IN MUTUALLY RESPECTFUL HARMONY IS AS MUCH A MYTH AS THE HORDES OF WELL FED HAPPY HEALTHY PEASANTS DOING AN HONEST DAY'S LABOUR IN THE FIELD FOR THEIR BENEVOLENT OWNERS

REALITY SOUNDS MORE LIKE THIS

SIGH

THE ARTICLE USES LEGALIZE AND DECRIMINALIZE INTERCHANGEABLY THESE TERMS ARE DIFFERENT

DECRIMINALIZING SOMETHING MEANS REMOVING LAWS THAT MAKE IT ILLEGAL LEGALIZING SOMETHING MEANS DECRIMINALIZING PLUS REGULATING IT

FOR INSTANCE DECRIMINALIZING MARIJUANA ALLOWS EVERYONE TO SELL AND PURCHASE IT AT LEAST EVERYONE WHO CAN LEGALLY SELL OR BUY THINGS FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION LEGALIZING MARIJUANA HAS IN PRACTICE REQUIRED DISPENSARIES TO BE SPECIALLY LICENSED AND PURCHASERS TO BE OVER THE AGE OF

IN THE CONTEXT OF SEX WORK DECRIMINALIZATION WOULD ALLOW ANYONE WHO COULD LEGALLY HAVE SEX WITH ANOTHER PERSON TO CHARGE THEM FOR FOR IT THAT'S IT LEGALIZATION COULD MEAN ANYTHING FROM A RUBBER-STAMP LICENSING SCHEME TO WEEKLY BLOOD TESTS TO HAVING TO GO THROUGH BUREAUCRATS KEEN TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL POWERFUL AT YOUR EXPENSE IT COULD PLACE UNDUE TAX BURDENS ON SEX WORK SPECIFICALLY

ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF SEX WORKERS NOT TO MENTION THEIR RIGHTS SHOULD SUPPORT MOVES TO MAKE IT A FULLY LEGAL INDUSTRY

WHAT RIGHTS DON'T SEX WORKERS HAVE THAT COULDN'T ALSO BE SOLVED BY THEM NOT BEING IN THAT LINE OF WORK

STATEMENTS LIKE THIS ARE BECOMING A REAL PROBLEM THESE DAYS IMO WE CAN'T JUST LEGALIZE EVERYTHING THAT MAKES LIVING A CRIMINAL LIFESTYLE HARD IT SEEMS TO BACKWARDS AND IS ALSO A SLIPPERY SLOPE

AS A GAME REPLACE SEX WORKER IN THE ABOVE QUOTE WITH SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S ILLEGAL AND SEE MY POINT

FOR INSTANCE METH COOKS

MAN THOSE POOR GUYS REALLY HAVE IT ROUGH INSTEAD OF DISCOURAGING THEM FROM DOING IT WE SHOULD HELP THEM TO DO IT SAFELY
IN OUR FIRST EPISODE AFTER THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY WE RETURN TO A DISCUSSION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL AND IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES THAT GENERATE LIBERAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE CREATION OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY INTIMATELY CONNECTED TO THE RECOGNITION OF IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCE IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT TOLERANCE IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT WE CONCLUDE WITH A DISCUSSION OF WHERE WE GO FROM HERE BY CONTEXTUALIZING OUR CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL ACCOUNT OF NOTION OF REVOLUTION AND CIVIL SOCIETY ENJOY
I TOUGHT THIS WAS SUBEDIT SIMULATOR
I ALSO THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO CONSIDER THE RIGHT TO LIFE FOR THE DELETED PATTERN TO USE THE STAR TREK TERM OF EACH TRANSPORTED PERSON EVERY TIME SOMEONE TRANSPORTS THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY CREATING AN ENTIRE PERSON COMPLETE WITH DESIRES MEMORIES AND SO FORTH AND IMMEDIATELY KILLING THEM BECAUSE THEY SHARE A PATTERN WITH SOMEONE ELSE

STAR TREK HAS TOYED WITH THIS ISSUE BEFORE WITH THE MAGNIFICENT RESULT OF TWO DISTINCT RIKERS WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SIDEBURNS DUE TO THE LOOSE CONTINUITY OF LORE FROM EPISODE TO EPISODE HOWEVER WE MOSTLY JUST GOT A FEW MINUTES OF PHILOSOPHY AND TWICE AS MANY RIKER
GREG EGAN INVESTIGATES ALL THIS SORT OF STUFF AND MUCH MORE IN HIS COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES CALLED AXIOMATIC ARE YOU STILL YOU IF YOU TAKE A DRUG THAT REWIRES YOUR BRAIN TO CHANGE YOUR DEEPLY HELD BELIEFS

PERSONALLY I THINK THAT THE WHOLE LAW OF IDENTITY IS ON SHAKY GROUNDS EVEN BEFORE THIS THE CONCEPT OF OBJECT WHICH CAN BE IDENTICAL IS NOT SOMETHING INHERENT IN THE WORLD AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET AS COMPLICATED AS PERSONAL IDENTITY TO CREATE CONUNDRUMS LIKE THIS X X IS TRUE IN MATHEMATICS ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DECLARE IT'S TRUE AND MY X'S HERE ARE OBVIOUS DIFFERENT FROM X'S OR ARE THEY

ALSO I FOUND THIS TO BE AN EXCELLENT TREATMENT
THE NOTION OF SELF IDENTITY OR SAMENESS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD OR IS IT THIS POST EXPLORES HOW PHILOSOPHY MAKES USE OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW PROBLEMATIC OUR NOTION OF SELF IDENTITY REALLY IS

I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION WITH THE ADDITION OF INNATE PERSONAL RIGHTS

IF A HUMAN SPLITS INTO SEVERAL COPIES DOES EACH RESULTANT HUMAN INHERIT THE SAME RIGHTS WHAT IF WE TAKE THE EXAMPLE AND PUT THAT HUMAN BRAIN IN A CANINE BODY DO HUMAN RIGHTS EVAPORATE FOR THE HYBRID CREATURE

IT'S MOSTLY JUST FOR NOW BUT IT SPEAKS TO THE PIECEMEAL NATURE OF OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY AND THE SYSTEMS WE CREATE FROM IT IN BOTH CASES RULES ARE MADE TO BE GOOD ENOUGH WITH REGARD TO THE ISSUES THAT WE ENCOUNTER MOST FREQUENTLY WHEN WE MEET OUTLYING CASES THEY'RE EITHER IGNORED COMPLETELY DESPERATELY AND GENERALLY INACCURATELY SHOVED INTO THE OLD SYSTEM OR REDEFINING OF THE WORLD AND HOW WE SEE IT
THE BOOKS ILIUM AND OLYMPUS BY DAN SIMMONS DEALT WITH THE TRANSPORTER ISSUE IN AN INTERESTING LIGHT A PROCESS THEY CALLED FAXING A COMMON TELETRANSPORTATION PROCESS HOS OPERATIONAL PRINCIPE WAS LOST TO TIME THE HUMANS COME TO FIND OUT THAT BASICALLY IT TAKES WAY TOO MUCH ENERGY TO ACTUALLY TRANSPORT MATTER BUT NOT MUCH TO TRANSPORT DATA SO EVERY TIME THEY WERE FAXING THEY WERE BEING DESTROYED ON THE SIDE THEY WERE LEAVING AND THEIR MOLECULAR COMPONENTS WERE GOING INTO A COMMON USE POOL AT THAT TRANSPORTER AND THEY WERE BEING REBUILT AT THE OTHER END FROM THE END POINT TRANSPORTERS COMMON MATERIAL POOL SO THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE COPIES OF COPIES OF COPIES WHO'S ORIGINAL HAD ESSENTIALLY DIED DECADES AGO THE FIRST TIME THEY FAXED SO AT THAT POINT ARE YOU STILL REAL ARE YOU STILL YOU WHAT DEFINES SELF IT'S A REALLY GOOD STUDY OF THE DEFINITION OF SELF ETHE AND STAR TREKS TRANSPORTATION BRINGS UP OTHER INTERESTING IDEAS LIKE SAVE STATES NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE TO DIE OR SUFFER INJURY JUST TRANSPORT THEM AND REPLACE THE DAMAGED SECTIONS WITH DATA FROM THE SAVE STATE YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR PHYSICAL FORM HOWEVER YOU LIKED OR AS DISCUSSED ALREADY YOU COULD MAKE MULTIPLE COPIES OF YOURSELF IT STARTS GETTING SUPER STICKY FROM A MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL ANGLE
WHY WAS THERE NO DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CONSCIOUS VS THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND IT SEEMS INTUITIVE TO ME THAT WE ARE OUR CONSCIOUS MINDS AND NOT OUR SUBCONSCIOUS MINDS WHICH IS MORE LIKE THE BODY THAN THE MIND IF WE MADE A NEW PERSON BY REPLICATING ALL THE CELLS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE NEW PERSON WOULD NOT HAVE A CONSCIOUS MIND BUT ONLY A SUBCONSCIOUS ONE A P ZOMBIE OF COURSE INTUITION CAN BE WRONG BUT IT'S A GOOD STARTING POINT

FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ABANDONED DUALISM AS A POSSIBILITY HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT PART OF THE MIND IS CONSCIOUS AND PART IS SUBCONSCIOUS IT SEEMS UNNECESSARY TO HAVE A CONSCIOUS MIND AT ALL
IF TWO OF YOU EXIST FOR A PERIOD OF TIME LIKE IN THE MARS EXAMPLE BEFORE ONE IS EVAPORATED THEN SURELY A DEATH OCCURS IN THIS EXAMPLE
TO ADD TO IDENTITY PREDICAMENTS WHAT IF IDENTITY IS ATTACHED TO CONSCIOUSNESS AND A TIMELINE WHEN YOU SPLIT YOUR BRAIN IN TWO AND PLACE EACH HALF IN A SEPARATE BODY WOULD THE RESULT NOT CREATE TWO NEW CONSCIOUSNESS TWO NEW EACH ONE BELIEVING THEY ARE YOU WITH EVERY INCH OF THEIR BEING RELATIVELY TO THEM THEY ARE THEM AND NOTHING HAS CHANGED BUT A NEW BODY BUT TO THE ORIGINAL BODY WOULD HIS TIMELINE NOT END HIS CONSCIOUSNESS CEASE TO EXIST THUSLY WHEN IMPLANTING EACH HALVE INTO A DIFFERENT BODY WOULD THAT CREATE TWO NEW TIMELINES FOR YOURSELF THE THOUGHT BEING THAT BECAUSE YOUR BOTH EXIST MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVELY AT THE SAME TIME YOUR EXPERIENCES FROM THEN ON CANNOT BE IDENTICAL

SAME AS WITH THE TRANSPONDER PREDICAMENT WHEN HE PRESSES THE GREEN BUTTON AND HIS OLD BODY BECOMES DISSONTEGRATED ALONG WITH THAT GOES THAT SPECIFIC TIMELINE AND THAT SPECIFIC CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN APPEARING ON MARS RELATIVE TO HIMSELF HE WOULD BE THE SAME BUT AS A CONSCIOUSNESS TIMELINE PERSPECTIVE HE IS NOT THE SAME
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FOUND MY WAY TO R PHILOSOPHY BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT FIND IT INTERESTING THAT HUMANS ACTUALLY DO HAVE THE SAME LIFE CYCLES AS AMOEBAE I STUDIED AMOEBAE IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND HETEROLOBOSEAN AMOEBOFLAGELLATES HAVE A STAGE LIFE CYCLE AMOEBIC FLAGELLATE AND CYST OR SPORE HUMANS HAVE THE SAME CELL TYPES AMOEBIC WOULD BE LIKE YOUR WHITE BLOOD CELLS THEY ESSENTIALLY FUNCTION THE SAME WAY SPERM ARE FLAGELLATES AND CYSTS ARE EGGS

I DID TRY TO READ THROUGH THE ARTICLE BUT IT TOOK TOO MUCH BRAIN POWER TO ACTUALLY READ IT SO I DIDN'T BUT I THOUGHT THIS FACT MIGHT INTEREST YOU GUYS
THE WEASE DIVIDES HOW HE WANTS BROSE
I THOUGHT THIS SAID PEOPLE WHO DRIVE LIKE AN AMOEBA AT FIRST GLANCE
THE VIDEO GAME SWAPPER IS SOMETHING LIKE A MEDITATION ON THIS PROBLEM AND A GOOD PUZZLER
THE BIGGEST IDEA I TAKE AWAY FROM THIS I FEEL THE WRITER COMPLETELY FAILS TO MENTION THAT IS OUR IDENTITY IS MORE DEPENDENT ON WHAT WE BELIEVE NOT TO EXIST THAN WHAT WE BELIEVE TO EXIST

THIS TIES INTO THE IDEAS ON SAMENESS AT THE BEGINNING I KNOW I AM ME BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER PERSON EXACTLY LIKE ME EVEN IF THEY HAVE THE SAME NAME AND MANNERISMS OR SOMEHOW LOOKED THE SAME THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME MEMORIES WHAT WE CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE OF THE CONTINUITY OF OUR EXPERIENCES IF THEY PROVED THAT THEY DID IT WOULD CALL INTO QUESTION MY PERCEIVED EXISTENCE AS AN INDIVIDUAL AS I WOULD NO LONGER HAVE EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO EVIDENCE OF MY OWN CONTINUITY

SIMILAR TO THE TRANSPONDER CONSIDER A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION WHERE YOU ARE A SUPER COMPUTER PROGRAMMER WITH A SUPER ADVANCED VR SIMULATOR FOR WHATEVER MOTIVATION NARCISSISTIC BASTARD YOU DECIDE TO SIMULATE YOUR BRAIN IN COMPUTER CODE LOAD YOURSELF INTO THE SIMULATION AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH AN EXACT REPLICA OF YOURSELF

THE ISSUE IS EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO DO THIS THE SIMULATION NEVER ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING ITSELF TO BE THE REAL YOU AND YOU TO BE THE SIMULATION

OF COURSE THEY ARE WRONG BUT EVENTUALLY YOU WOULD HAVE TO LOG OUT JUST TO BE SURE WOULDN'T YOU INSIDE THE SIMULATION WITH NO PHYSICAL EXISTENTIAL LANDMARKS AKA YOUR BODY AND UNDER FORFEIT OF THE EXCLUSIVITY TO YOUR MENTAL EXISTENTIAL LANDMARKS YOUR MEMORIES AND EXPERIENCES THERE IS NO WAY FOR YOU TO BE SURE THAT YOU ARE THE ORIGINAL IF YOU CAN COPY YOUR MEMORIES ONCE YOU CAN COPY THEM A MILLION TIMES AND THERE WILL BE A MILLION COPIES BELIEVING THEY ARE THE ORIGINAL WE VALIDATE OUR EXISTENCE BY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE PEOPLE AROUND US AND THE EXCLUSIVITY OF OUR MEMORIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES ASSURE US WE ARE OURSELVES AND NOT SOMEONE ELSE


THIS IS ALSO WHY WHEN WE LOOK AT PEOPLE ALL DRESSED IN UNIFORM OR PERFORMING TASKS IN ROBOTIC UNISON WE FEEL A COMPONENT OF THEIR PERSONALITY IS MISSING THE MORE SIMILAR THEY ARE AND LESS THEY CONTRAST TO THE PERSON NEXT TO THEM THE LESS WE PERCEIVE THEM AS HAVING INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY AT ALL
IF ONE SUFFERED A BRAIN TRAUMA WHICH DESTROYED HALF OF ONE'S BRAIN I THINK IT IS REASONABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON WHO WAS CONSCIOUS BEFORE THE BRAIN TRAUMA IS STILL THE SAME CONSCIOUS PERSON AFTER THE TRAUMA IT DOESN'T SEEM NECESSARY TO SAY THE PERSON CEASED TO EXIST AND THEN A NEW PERSON STARTED EXISTING

SO WHEN IMPLANTING EACH HALF INTO A DIFFERENT BODY I THINK IT IS REASONABLE TO SAY THEY ARE THE SAME CONSCIOUS PERSON AND IT IS JUST DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMAGINE WHAT SORT OF EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD BE FOR INSTANCE A CHAMELEON HAS EYES WHICH MOVE INDEPENDENTLY OF ONE ANOTHER ONE EYE LOOKS OVER AT THIS THING AND AT THE SAME TIME THIS OTHER EYE LOOKS AT THIS THING SUCH AN EXPERIENCE IS PROBABLY COGNITIVELY IMPENETRABLE TO US BUT IT HAPPENS AND SEEMS TO WORK WELL FOR THE CHAMELEON

IF THE BRAIN IS THE MAKER OF ONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS AND IF IT IS POSSIBLE FOR HALF OF A BRAIN TO MAKE ONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS THEN WHEN A BRAIN IS DIVIDED INTO TWO HALVES ONE IS CONSCIOUS IN BOTH IT'S PROBABLY NOT POSSIBLE TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY THAT CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE WOULD BE LIKE THOUGH
WHO I AM IS MY CASE

WHILE IT DOES SEEM TRUE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE UN ETHICAL TREATMENT OF ANIMALS DURING THEIR LIVES AS LIVESTOCK IN A LIBERAL SYSTEM I THINK THERE ARE FAR LESS INTRUSIVE WAYS OF DOING SO SUCH AS A SIGN PERHAPS NEXT TO THE CHICKEN SECTION OR WHAT HAVE YOU WARNING LABELS ON A FOOD ITEM THAT IS NOT A HEALTH CONCERN DIRECTLY WOULD SEEM TOO MUCH LIKE THE LABELLERS OF THE PRODUCT ARE PUSHING SOME ETHICAL AGENDA ETHICAL CONCERNS ARE FAR FROM THE SAME AS A HEALTH CONCERN AND USING THE EXAMPLE OF CIGARETTE WARNING LABELS SEEMS DISANALOGOUS HERE BECAUSE OF THE DIVIDE BETWEEN HUMAN ETHICS AND ANIMAL ETHICS EACH TIME SOMEONE BUYS SOME MEAT OR OTHER ANIMAL PRODUCT WOULD FACE AN ETHICAL DILEMMA AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A RATHER UNPLEASANT WAY OF EDUCATING ETHICAL WARNING LABELS ON FOOD THEN SEEM TOO STRONG TO BE USED PRACTICALLY
THE IDEA IS THOUGHT PROVOKING TO BE SURE BUT TOO MANY THINGS COULD AND WOULD GO WRONG WITH EXECUTION OF THE IDEA REALISTICALLY PEOPLE WOULD BE QUICK TO PROTEST OR VETO IT
NOT EVERY CALF IS TAKEN FROM ITS MOTHER AND SLAUGHTERED JUST LIKE NOT ALL DRINKING WATER WAS NASTY AT ONE POINT YOU COULD EASILY PROMOTE YOUR ETHICAL REASONS TO FARMERS AND AS AN AD CAMPAIGN FOR ETHICAL FARMERS ADD THAT TO THE LABELS I GREW UP FARMING AND KNOW HUNDREDS MORE THE FARMERS I KNOW RAISE THOUSANDS OF CATTLE AND ALMOST ALL ARE NAMED AND BABIED

WHILE I KNOW THERE ARE SOME BAD APPLES IN EVERY GROUP GENERALIZING FARMING METHODS IS REALLY DUMB

HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MANDATORY ULTRASOUND BEFORE ABORTIONS OR PRESENTING WOMEN WHO WANT ABORTIONS WITH MANDATORY FACTS ALL YOUR DOING IS PROVIDING THE WOMEN WITH MORE INFORMATION

INFORMATION IS LARGELY FREELY AVAILABLE IN THE MODERN ERA IT IS LARGELY SAFE TO ASSUME ANYONE INTERESTED IN A PARTICULAR SUBJECT OR PRODUCT CAN SIMPLY GOOGLE IT ATTEMPTS AT MANDATORY INFORMATION ARE SIMPLY APPEALS TO EMOTIONS OR BARRIERS TO THE PRODUCT BEING AVAILABLE AT ALL AND RARELY PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT ISN'T ALREADY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

JUST AS WITH ABORTION PUTTING MANDATORY IN THE WAY DOESN'T LEAD TO MORE INFORMED BEHAVIOR OR SAFER BEHAVIOR IT SIMPLY LEADS TO LESS OF THAT BEHAVIOR WITHOUT REGARD TO THE ACTOR'S ABILITY TO DECIDE ON THEIR OWN
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE SEEN SOMETHING ON THE FRONT PAGE WITH NO COMMENTS I WISH THE SOUND WAS A BIT BETTER THE TITLE IS INTRIGUING
THINKING LIKE THIS MAKES ME ANXIOUS IF NOT OUTRIGHT SUICIDAL I ONLY HAD TIME TO SKIM THE PIECE BUT IT REFLECTS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN TRYING TO ARTICULATE FOR A FEW YEARS I'M STARTING TO THINK WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY INCAPABLE OF JUSTIFYING OUR BELIEFS IN A SATISFYING WAY THE MORE CONFIDENT I BECOME IN A BELIEF THE LARGER THIS SPECTER OF BIASED THINKING LOOMS
TOWARDS THE END OF THE DESCRIPTIVE SECTION I THINK THEY ARE ON THE MONEY WHEN WE AGREE WITH A HYPOTHESIS WE DON'T GO AROUND LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES BUT WHEN WE DISAGREE WITH A HYPOTHESIS WE DO GO AROUND LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS

IN THE NORMATIVE SECTION HE MENTIONS SCIENCE BUT MENTIONS THE WRONG ASPECT OF SCIENCE TO QUOTE RONALD FISHER COINING PHRASE NULL HYPOTHESIS IN RELATION TO ANY EXPERIMENT WE MAY SPEAK OF THIS HYPOTHESIS AS THE NULL HYPOTHESIS AND IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IS NEVER PROVED OR ESTABLISHED BUT IS POSSIBLY DISPROVED IN THE COURSE OF EXPERIMENTATION EVERY EXPERIMENT MAY BE SAID TO EXIST ONLY IN ORDER TO GIVE THE FACTS A CHANCE OF DISPROVING THE NULL HYPOTHESIS THE DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS EDINBURGH OLIVER AND BOYD PAGE

THE ONLY PURPOSE OF EVIDENCE IS TO DISPROVE HYPOTHESES THEREFORE OF COURSE WE SPEND TONS OF TIME ON DISCONFIRMATORY EVIDENCE IF IT IS WEAK WE IGNORE IT IF IT HOLD UP WE CHANGE OUR OPINION EVIDENCE WHICH SUPPORTS OUR POSITION IS USELESS HENCE WE IGNORE IT THE ONLY PURPOSE OF EVIDENCE WHICH SUPPORTS OUR POSITIONS IS TO DISPROVE THE INCORRECT THEORIES OF OTHERS

PRESENTING ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF ONE'S OWN ARGUMENT IS INHERENTLY FALLACIOUS THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO IS DISPROVE OTHER PEOPLE'S THEORIES AND HOPE THAT THEY CAN DISPROVE YOURS AND REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING THAT STANDS TALL UNTIL IT TOO IS KNOCKED DOWN

THE BEST LIFE IS THE CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE BY SEEKING UNDERSTANDING ONE CAN OBTAIN THE MOST HAPPINESS FROM THEIR LIFE LEARNING AND GROWING AS A PERSON AT ALL TIMES IS THE BEST WAY TO GAIN THE GREATEST HAPPINESS
A VERY INTERESTING PARALLEL THAT CAN BE OBSERVED IN MOST PHILOSOPHIES AND RELIGIONS IS WHAT CAN BE TERMED AS THE MIDDLE PATH

BUDDHISM IS BASED ON FOLLOWING THE MIDDLE PATH AND DESCRIBES IT AS THE PATH OF WISDOM
ARISTOTLE SAYS THAT THESE VIRTUES ARE CHARACTERISTICS THAT OCCUPY MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN EXCESS AND DEFICIENCY

I'VE BEEN NOTICING THIS MORE OFTEN WHEN I READ AND I FELT THIS WAS INTERESTING

IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO CHRIS SURPRENANT UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS DISCUSSES THE ACCOUNT OF HUMAN WELL-BEING AND THE GOOD LIFE PRESENTED BY ARISTOTLE IN THE NICOMACHEAN ETHICS AND POLITICS HE EXPLAINS WHY ARISTOTLE BELIEVES THAT A HUMAN BEING LIVES WELL WHEN HE ACTS RIGHTLY AND POSSESSES ALL VIRTUES BOTH INTELLECTUAL AND THOSE RELATING TO GOOD CHARACTER

LIFE IS ODD
ARISTOTLE STARTS WITH A PREMISS THAT I CALL INTO QUESTION THERE IS AN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTE RIGHT GOOD VIRTUOUS BEHAVIOR

AT BEST WE ASSIGN RIGHT AND WRONG TO THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS BASED ON THE COMMUNAL CONVERSATION OF MORALITY AND WE TEND TO BELIEVE THAT OUR COMMUNAL MORALITY IS THE ONE TRUE MORALITY

IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMPRINT THE CONCEPT OF AN AMORAL UNIVERSE ONTO ARISTOTLE AND WHILE HIS PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS ARE QUITE SOPHISTICATED AND STRUCTURALLY SOUND BASED ON HIS PREMISS WITHOUT UNIVERSAL MORALITY HIS ARGUMENTS ARE DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN

HOWEVER ONE CAN IMPRINT WORKABILITY ONTO ARISTOTLE WHAT IS AND IS NOT WORKABLE TO MAINTAIN A GIVEN CULTURE CAN BE MAPPED ONTO WHAT HE CALLS VICIOUS AND VIRTUOUS THEN THERE IS A PATH TO ALTERING THE COMMUNAL CONVERSATION OF RIGHT AND WRONG

I WOULD NOT LIKE TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY DRIVEN BY POSITION IN THE US THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE GET WHEN THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT GAINS POLITICAL CONTROL GW BUSH ONCE SAID THAT THE JOB OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TO BE THE MORAL COMPASS OF THE COUNTRY ARISTOTLE WOULD HAVE APPROVED FOR ME THAT KIND OF TALK TERRIFIES ME
SO WHERE WOULD ONE START IN PURSUING INTELLECTUAL VIRTUES IS IT LIKE A JACK OF ALL TRADES SORT OF THING JUST LEARN A LITTLE OF A LOT OF THINGS
WHAT AREA OF PHILOSOPHY WOULD THIS GOOD LIFE DISCUSSION BE CONSIDERED
IS THIS TRUE
REMOVED
GOOD ONE I'LL FOLLOW THIS CHANNEL THANK YOU FOR SHARING MATE
I LOVED THIS THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS WAS VERY ENLIGHTENING FOR ME
THIS IS A COOL VIDEO BUT THE HAND AND THE HAND DRAWING GOT OLD FAST
WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ARISTOTLE IS THAT HE BELIEVED HEAVILY IN PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE AND USING THAT PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE TO DEVELOP THE VIRTUES THE ACT OF DEVELOPING THOSE VIRTUES WILL BRING YOU HAPPINESS IN BOTH PLEASURE AND KNOWLEDGE
OUTSTANDING
WHY DOES ITS BEING IN COMMON WITH ANIMALS DISQUALIFY THE PURSUIT OF BODILY PLEASURES AS BEING THE HIGHEST GOOD IT SEEMS LIKE A FOUNDING PREMISE IS HUMAN CHAUVINISM
I'VE HEARD THAT THE ONLY TRUE PATH TO A HAPPY LIFE IS BY PERFORMING ACTS OF KINDNESS FOR OTHERS
HOW DOES PAIN COME INTO THIS ARGUMENT

CONTEMPLATING IT LEARNING ABOUT IT AND TREATING IT IS THE VIRTUOUS PATH IN MY OPINION BUT WHAT IF ALL THIS DOESN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY LIFE IS NOT WELL AT THIS POINT EITHER
ARISTOTLE IS LUCKY SOCRATES WASN'T AROUND TO PROBLEMATIZE ALL OF THE COUNTLESS THINGS HE JUST ASSERTED
THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING VIDEO HOPE TO SEE MORE OF THESE SOON

TRUMP S UNIQUE CANDIDACY PRESENTS ANOTHER REASON TO WORK FOR HIM SINGER SAID SINCE SO MANY OF HIS POSITIONS ARE POORLY DEFINED ANYONE WHO ENDS UP IN THE ADMINISTRATION COULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE ON TRUMP S POLICY THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT

THIS IS A FAIR POINT

PETER SINGER STATES THAT ONE MUST BE PREPARED TO LEAVE IF THEY FEEL THAT THEY CANNOT MAKE A POSITIVE CHANGE AFTER AT LEAST TRYING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK THIS POINT MUST BE EMPHASIZED

SEEMS OBVIOUS HE'S NOT SOME TYRANT RIGGING ELECTIONS WITH A TRACK RECORD OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HE ACTUALLY SEEMS TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE HE TALKS TO THAT TREAT HIM WITH SOME RESPECT DEFINITELY MORAL TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND OFFER YOUR INPUT
BUT WHEN IS IT THE RIGHT TIME TO QUIT
ABSTRACT

PHILOSOPHY OF MIND AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE EAST G CLARK AND CHALMERS CLARK PALERMO HAVE RECENTLY BECOME INCREASINGLY RECEPTIVE TO THE HYPOTHESIS OF EXTENDED COGNITION ACCORDING TO WHICH EXTERNAL ARTIFACTS SUCH AS OUR LAPTOPS AND SMARTPHONES CAN UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES FEATURE AS MATERIAL REALISERS OF A PERSON S COGNITIVE PROCESSES WE ARGUE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE HYPOTHESIS OF EXTENDED COGNITION IS CORRECT OUR LEGAL AND ETHICAL THEORISING AND PRACTICE MUST BE UPDATED BY BROADENING OUR CONCEPTION OF PERSONAL ASSAULT SO AS TO INCLUDE INTENTIONAL HARM TOWARDS GADGETS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATELY INTEGRATED WE NEXT SITUATE THE THEORETICAL CASE FOR EXTENDED PERSONAL ASSAULT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF SOME RECENT ETHICAL AND LEGAL CASES AND CLOSE WITH SOME CRITICAL DISCUSSION

U HEYBERTRUSSELL ASKS

I'M AN UNDERGRAD PHILOSOPHY MAJOR AND I'VE RECENTLY BEGUN STUDYING COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY I'VE BEEN LOOKING FURTHER OUTSIDE OF THE WESTERN CANON OF PHILOSOPHY AND HAVE BEGUN STUDYING ASIAN PHILOSOPHIES CHINESE AND INDIAN SO FAR AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO DELVING INTO OTHER TRADITIONS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT STUDYING WHAT IS OFTEN CONSIDERED RELIGION EX BUDDHISM OR FOLKLORE EX AFRICAN AS PHILOSOPHY

I BELIEVE THAT STUDYING EASTERN RELIGIONS CAN BE PHILOSOPHICALLY VALUABLE ONE OF MY FAVORITE PHILOSOPHERS SCHOPENHAUER STUDIED BUDDHISM AND HINDUISM AND FOUND MANY PARALLELS THERE WITH HIS OWN PHILOSOPHY I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT AFRICAN FOLKLORE OR MANY OTHERS FORMS OF FOLKLORE BUT IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF THERE ARE PHILOSOPHICALLY VALUABLE INSIGHTS TO BE FOUND THERE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PHILOSOPHERS IN THE WEST ARE EXPLORING THESE OTHER TRADITIONS THERE ARE QUITE A FEW ARTICLES ON PHILOSOPHY AT THE STANFORD ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY SO THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO LOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO
U READTHISLIKEBATMAN ASKS AND YES I'M READING THIS LIKE BATMAN

I RECENTLY READ FINITISM AND THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE A POSITION ON PWT VERSUS PPT

THANKS I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU READ IT IF WE'RE TAKING TIME TO BE CONTINUOUS AS MOST PEOPLE DO THEN I FAVOR THE PRIORITY OF THE WHOLE PWT OVER THE PRIORITY OF THE PARTS PPT I THINK THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE PARADOXES WHICH I DON'T THINK ARE SOLVED BY ANYTHING FROM MODERN MATHEMATICS

YOU DIDN'T TACKLE THE ISSUE OF WHETHER SPACE-TIME IS DISCRETE OR NOT AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS MIGHT BE ON THAT WHAT JUMPS TO MY MIND IS THAT IF SPACETIME IS SOME SORT OF GRID THIS FORCES A PREFERRED DIRECTION ANISOTROPY WHICH SHOULD IN PRINCIPLE BE MEASURABLE I BELIEVE EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE TO THIS EFFECT OBSERVING GAMMA RAY BURSTS FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND FOUND NOTHING AND SO I'M INCLINED TO SAY THAT SPACE IS CONTINUOUS DO YOU THINK THIS IS A DEFENSIBLE ARGUMENT

YOU'RE RIGHT I DIDN'T THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUE THE IDEA THAT SPACETIME AND OR MOTION MIGHT BE DISCRETE IS A BIT WEIRD TO SAY THE LEAST BUT IT'S NOT INCOHERENT IN FACT LEIBNIZ ONE OF THE GREATEST PHILOSOPHERS AND NO SLOUCH IN THE AREAS OF MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS THOUGHT THAT EXTENSION DURATION AND ACTUAL MOTION WERE DISCRETE SO I'M SKEPTICAL OF THE VIEW BUT I'M NOT SURE I COULD GIVE A CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENT AGAINST DISCRETE SPACE-TIME AND IT MAY BE THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR FAVORING IT JEAN PAUL VAN BENDEGEM IS ONE RECENT DEFENDER OF DISCRETE SPACE AND TIME

THE ARGUMENT YOU SKETCH IS INTERESTING AND THERE MAY WELL BE SOMETHING TO IT BUT IT'S HARD TO SAY WITHOUT HEARING MORE ABOUT THE DETAILS AND ABOUT THESE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
FIRST UP U ASKS

DO YOU BELIEVE ANIMALS CAN BE MORALLY WRONGED IF YES HOW SO AND RELATEDLY IS THE VIEW YOU DESCRIBE IN YOUR SCHOPENHAUER ON THE RIGHTS OF ANIMALS PRETTY MUCH YOUR OWN VIEW ON THE MATTER

GREAT QUESTION YES I DO BELIEVE ANIMALS CAN BE MORALLY WRONGED THE ACCOUNT OF WRONG I ATTRIBUTE TO SCHOPENHAUER IN THE PAPER STRIKES ME AS PRETTY PLAUSIBLE ON THAT VIEW WRONGING HAS TO DO WITH THWARTING THE WILL OF ANOTHER OUT OF MALICE OR AN EXCESSIVE EGOISM AND I THINK AT LEAST MOST ANIMALS HAVE WILLS THAT CAN BE THWARTED OUT OF MALICE OR EXCESSIVE EGOISM NAMELY BY US SO I THINK THAT AT LEAST MOST ANIMALS CAN BE WRONGED EXAMPLE IF I CAUSE SOME ANIMAL CONSIDERABLE PAIN BECAUSE I TAKE PLEASURE IN SEEING IT SUFFER MALICE THEN I AM MORALLY WRONGING THAT ANIMAL

SPEAKING MORE GENERALLY YES I WOULD SAY MY VIEWS IN THE AREA OF ANIMAL ETHICS ARE VERY CLOSE TO THOSE I ATTRIBUTE TO SCHOPENHAUER IN MY PAPER

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRIAL ANIMAL AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ARE MORALLY WRONG IF SO DO YOU ALSO TAKE IT TO BE MORALLY WRONG TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS

IF SUITABLE NUTRITIONALLY SUFFICIENT ALTERNATIVES ARE AVAILABLE THEN YES I DO BELIEVE THOSE PRACTICES ARE WRONG AND THAT IT'S MORALLY WRONG TO SUPPORT THEM BY BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS

GREAT
AS A HISTORIAN WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HOW SCHOPENHAUER IS TREATED IN ANGLOPHONE DEPARTMENTS AS COMPARED SAY TO ITS TREATMENT OF HEGEL AND NIETZSCHE WHAT HAS MADE US PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE LATTER
U SYNDICATE ASKS SEVERAL QUESTIONS

DO YOU THINK LEIBNIZES IDEA THAT THIS IS THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS HOLDS WATER HAS ANY TRUTH TO IT I KNOW RESPONDS WITH HIS BOOK CANDIDE AND CALLS OUT HIS IDEA AS FOOLISH

WELL I THINK IT MAY WELL BE THAT THIS IS THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS BECAUSE I THINK IT MAY WELL BE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE WORLD IN OTHER WORDS MAYBE SPINOZA WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL THAT THIS WORLD AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WITHIN IT IS NECESSARY ON THE OTHER HAND IF THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE WORLDS AS LEIBNIZ AND MOST OTHERS THINK THEN IT SEEMS UNLIKELY TO ME THAT THIS IS THE BEST POSSIBLE WORLD THOUGH I DON'T SEE HOW THAT COULD BE REFUTED INCIDENTALLY SCHOPENHAUER THOUGHT THAT LEIBNIZ HAD IT EXACTLY BACKWARDS THIS IS THE WORST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS

BESIDES THE FACT THAT THE WORLD ISN'T PERFECT AT LEAST IT SEEMS THAT WAY TO MOST PEOPLE IS THERE ANY OTHER REASON TO REJECT THEODICY ASSUMING THAT YOU DO REJECT IT

THEODICY CONSISTS OF MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS SOME OF THEM ARE SENSIBLE OTHERS NOT SO MUCH I DO THINK THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO DOUBT MANY PARTS OF HIS THEODICY I CAN'T GO INTO THEM IN ANY DETAIL HERE BUT I DID CALL ATTENTION TO WHAT I THINK IS A NEW PROBLEM FOR HIM IN A RECENT PAPER CALLED EVIL AS PRIVATION AND REJECTION OF EMPTY SPACE THE GIST OF THAT PAPER IS THAT LEIBNIZ CAN'T CONSISTENTLY REJECT EMPTY SPACE IN SOME OF THE WAYS HE DOES WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING THAT A PERFECT GOD WOULD ALLOW EVIL

2 I SAW AN INTENSEST OF YOURS IS ETHICS AND I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING WHY AN ATHEIST SHOULD HAVE AN OBLIGATION OR DESIRE TO EXCEPT TO USE ETHICAL CONDUCT TO BE WELL LIKED AND HELP YOURSELF ACT ETHICALLY THIS IS PROBABLY A BIG QUESTION TO TACKLE BUT WHY DO YOU THINK ATHEISTS SHOULD ACT ETHICALLY

I THINK THIS WOULD BE CONTROVERSIAL AMONG PHILOSOPHERS BUT I THINK THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRUDENCE NOT MORALITY I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY SUCH THING AS A MORAL OUGHT OR MORAL SHOULD SO THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY AN ATHEIST SHOULD BE MORAL FOR INSTANCE SHE MIGHT WANT TO RESPECTED BY HER LOVED ONES BUT NONE OF THESE REASONS ARE MORAL REASONS

I AM A PHILOSOPHY STUDENT WAS MAJOR NOW A MINOR CAUSE MY NEW COLLEGE DOESN'T HAVE THE MAJOR AND AM VERY INTERESTED IN ATTENDING GRADUATE SCHOOL AND MAYBE EVEN GOING ON TO GET A PHD DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR ME AS I PURSUE THIS GOAL BESIDES THE ADVICE OF NOT GOING SINCE THE CHANCES OF GETTING A JOB ARE SLIM HAHA

IF YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT PHILOSOPHY AND AREN'T BEING TEMPTED BY AN ALTERNATIVE CAREER PATH THEN GO FOR IT YOU CAN ALWAYS DO SOMETHING ELSE LATER IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME NOTE THAT YOUR CHANCES OF A CAREER AS AN ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHER ARE MUCH GREATER IF YOU ARE COMING OUT OF A TOP PH D PROGRAM CHECK THE PHILOSOPHICAL GOURMET FOR SOME RANKINGS OF FACULTY REPUTATION

THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND GOOD LUCK
U ADEFINITEDESCRIPTION ASKS

I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH BUT IN A VERY BROAD SENSE YOU SEEM TO HAVE A VERY WIDE RANGE OF RESEARCH INTERESTS FROM HISTORY TO METAPHYSICS TO ETHICS DOES ANYTHING UNIFY THESE INTERESTS FOR YOU OR DO YOU JUST WORK ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TOPICS YOU FIND INTERESTING

THANKS I DO HAVE A WIDE AND EVER WIDENING RANGE OF INTERESTS SO FAR I DON'T THINK ANYTHING INTERESTING UNIFIES THESE INTERESTS EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE MINE WHICH IS OF COURSE VERY INTERESTING FOR THE MOST PART I'M JUST WORKING ON THE THINGS THAT INTEREST ME BUT ONE DAY I HOPE THAT THEY WILL BEGIN TO CONNECT WITH ONE ANOTHER IN VARIOUS WAYS SO THAT THEY FORM SOMETHING OF A SYSTEM OR SYSTEMATIC COLLECTION OF INTERESTS

IT'S COMMON AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE AND TALKING TO OTHER GRAD STUDENTS AND JUNIOR PHILOSOPHERS TO GET ADVICE TO TRY TO BUILD A SYSTEMATIC RESEARCH PROGRAM IN ONE OR TWO AREAS AND TRY TO BECOME A SPECIALIST IN THAT THING BUT MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FIND OURSELVES TORN BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF INTERESTING TOPICS TO WORK AND PUBLISH ON WHICH AREN'T NECESSARILY THEMATICALLY OR PHILOSOPHICALLY UNIFIED IN ANY SUBSTANTIVE SENSE

WHEN YOU'RE FIRST COMING OUT AND TRYING TO GET ESTABLISHED IT HELPS TO FOCUS ON ONE OR A SMALL NUMBER OF THINGS SO YOU CAN BE AS GOOD AT THEM AS POSSIBLE SOME HAVE IN MIND THE MORE UPPER ECHELON ALSO EXPECT THEIR PEOPLE TO SPECIALIZE BUT I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO JUST WORK ON A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT TOPICS THAT ONE HAPPENS TO FIND INTERESTING DOING SO WILL HELP TO CONNECT TOPICS TO ONE ANOTHER IN WAYS THAT ARE HELPFUL WE NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT LOTS OF DIFFERENT TOPICS TO SEE THESE CONNECTIONS FOR INSTANCE ONE PAPER I'M WORKING ON BRINGS THE FREE WILL LITERATURE INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE POLITICAL OBLIGATION LITERATURE WHERE CURRENTLY THERE IS A GAPING DISCONNECT

I WAS JUST CURIOUS IF YOU COULD SPEAK FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AS TO WHY YOU HAVE CHOSEN THE ROUTE YOU DID THANKS

IT SEEMS WE HAVE AN OVERLAPPING INTEREST IN ISSUES IN MORAL LAW AND WHAT PARTICIPATING IN A POLITICAL SOCIETY IS LIKE ON THAT TOPIC I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH INDIVIDUALS IN A POLITICAL SOCIETY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT SOCIETY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE FRUITFULLY IN IT

OUR PARADIGMS OF ACTION ARE WHERE PEOPLE DO SOMETHING WITH A PARTICULAR END IN MIND AND SOME CONCEPTION OF HOW THAT ACTION IS A MEANS TO THE SPECIFIED END BUT VERY OFTEN WHEN WE ENGAGE IN LARGE SOCIAL STRUCTURES THIS ISN'T THE CASE IT'S DUBIOUS IN THE EXTREME THAT MOST PEOPLE ENGAGING WITH THE GOVERNMENT MEET ANYTHING LIKE THIS STANDARD OF HAVING AN EFFECTIVE CHAIN OF REASONING IN MIND WHEN THEY DO SO INVOLVING ALL THE STEPS BETWEEN THEIR POLITICAL ACTION VOTING SAY AND THEIR DESIRED OUTCOME BETTER WORK PROSPECTS SAY AND BY OUR PARADIGM IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH OF THE CHAINS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE TO IMPROVING THEIR WORK PROSPECTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH VOTE TO CAST AND CLEARLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE IT'S POSSIBLE GIVEN HOW LARGE AND COMPLEX THE FORCES IN ACTION ARE THAT NOBODY HAS EPISTEMIC ACCESS TO A COMPLETE SUCH REASONING CHAIN

HERE'S A SIMPLE EXAMPLE I MAKE USE OF THE MAIL SYSTEM INCLUDING SENDING THINGS OVERSEAS AND I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO TO EFFECT THAT PUT THE LETTER IN THE RIGHT ENVELOPE PUT THE RIGHT ADDRESS ON IT THE RIGHT STAMPS AND PUT IT IN THE RIGHT BOX BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW MUCH AT ALL ABOUT HOW THE LETTER GETS THERE I KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AT THE TWO ENDS OF THE PROCESS WITH THE MAIL SERVICE PICKING UP THE LETTER FROM THE BOX TAKING IT TO BE SORTED ETC AND AT THE DESTINATION IT COMING TO THE RIGHT POST OFFICE AND BEING DELIVERED TO THE ADDRESS BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE STEPS IN THE DON'T KNOW HOW INTERNATIONAL MAIL FREIGHT GETS ORGANISED I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HANDOVER BETWEEN DIFFERENT POSTAL SERVICES WORK ETC I CERTAINLY KNOW NOTHING LIKE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER MY POSTING THE LETTER WILL BE EFFECTIVE BUT I DO IT AND IT IS EFFECTIVE

SO IT SEEMS THAT IF THE PROCESS IS COMPLEX ENOUGH OUR PARADIGM BREAKS DOWN AND IN SOCIAL CASES WE CAN HAVE STRINGS OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS ARE DOING WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF POLITICAL CONSENT HECK GIVEN THAT THE PREDOMINANT VIEWS OF SOCIAL ACTION DEPEND ON A PARTICULAR KIND OF INTENTION TO ENGAGE IN A PROCESS TOGETHER EAST G HOLIST AND INDIVIDUALIST THEORIES WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOCIAL ACTION TOUT COURT I HAVE NO IDEA WHO HANDLES THE MAIL BETWEEN MY POSTING THE LETTER AND IT ARRIVING AT ITS DESTINATION NOT ANY REAL IDEA OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING BUT THE MAIL GETS THERE AND CLEARLY WE ENGAGE IN SOCIAL ACTIONS HOW DO YOU THINK OUR THEORIES SHOULD REACT TO THESE LARGE LACUNAE IN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE PROCESSES ESPECIALLY SOCIAL PROCESSES IN WHICH WE ARE INELIMINABLE PARTICIPATING IN
U REASONRISING SAYS

I'M A SELF-TAUGHT PHILOSOPHER LOOKING FOR LITERATURE RELATED TO A POLITICAL THEORY I'M WORKING IN THE THEORY BEGINS WITH A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THAT PROVES THE MERE EXISTENCE OF HUMANITY IMPLIES THE EXISTENCE OF FIVE AND ONLY FIVE CONTEXTS OF ACTION FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A GIVEN SOCIETY PRIVATE ACTION PUBLIC ACTION POLITICAL ACTION FOREIGN ACTION AND FUTURE ACTION THIS IN TURN IMPLIES FIVE AND ONLY FIVE CONTEXTS OF CONCEPTS RELATED TO HUMAN ACTION GOALS INTENTION THE USE OF RESOURCE OWNERSHIP OF RESOURCES JUSTICE INJUSTICE METHODS FOR SOCIETY TO IMPOSE JUSTICE FREEDOM FROM INJUSTICE PRICE THE NEGOTIATION OF PRICE AND THE BENEFITS OF THE FREE NEGOTIATION OF PRICE OVER TIME THESE ARE ALL THE REQUIRED ELEMENTS TO EXTEND ADAM INVISIBLE HAND TO ALL CONTEXTS OF HUMAN ACTION IT IS ALSO ALL THAT IS NEEDED TO EXTEND ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE FREE NEGOTIATION OF PRICE TO ALL HUMAN ACTION

AND THEN ASKS

ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY LITERATURE IN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY ETHICS THAT APPROACHES THE SUBJECT IN THIS WAY

NUMBER BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN MUCH BECAUSE THE LITERATURE ON POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY IS ENORMOUS AND I AM A NEWCOMER TO THAT SUBDISCIPLINE A GOOD PLACE TO START WOULD BE WITH THE PHILOSOPHICAL LITERATURE ON SMITH SEE THE SEP ARTICLE ON MORAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY FOR A HELPFUL BIBLIOGRAPHY
U LEEHYORI ASKS

MANY PHILOSOPHERS AND STUDENTS ARE PERPLEXED BY MORAL PHILOSOPHY MANY PHILOSOPHERS WHO DON'T WORK ON KANT AND MANY STUDENTS WHO READ THE GROUNDWORK COME AWAY THINKING THAT THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE IS SOMETHING LIKE OR THE GOLDEN RULE

THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTIONS THE CI IS LIKE RU AND THE GR IN SOME WAYS BUT DIFFERS FROM THEM IN IMPORTANT WAYS TOO CI AND RU BOTH POSIT MORAL RULES BUT ONE SEES THOSE RULES AS DEFINED BY WHAT WOULD YIELD THE BEST OUTCOME WHEREAS THE OTHER SEES THOSE RULES AS DEFINED BY WHAT IS RATIONAL I EAST WHAT CAN BE UNIVERSALLY WILLED WITHOUT CONTRADICTION THE CI AS KANT UNDERSTANDS IT IS MUCH BROADER THAN THE GR IT MAY INDEED COMMAND ONE TO DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU BUT IT ALSO COMMANDS YOU TO DO THINKS LIKE DEVELOP YOUR TALENTS AND NOT COMMIT SUICIDE THINGS WHICH THE GR DOESN'T SEEM TO ADDRESS SINCE THEY ARE NOT ABOUT OTHERS

DO YOU HAVE ANY PREFERRED INTERPRETATION OF CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE FOR EXAMPLE THE UNIVERSALIZATION FORMULA WHAT ARE SOME OF ITS ADVANTAGES AND INSIGHTS

NO I DO NOT HAVE ANY SPECIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE CI
IT SEEMS TO BE A COMMON JOKE THAT A DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY IS USELESS AND A WASTE OF TIME WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS TO A YOUNG GUY WHO IS VERY INTERESTED IN PURSUING SUCH A DIRECTION
I AM A GRADUATE OF NC STATE AND TOOK A NUMBER OF ENGLISH AND OTHER HUMANITIES IN IS THAT WERE YOUR OFFICES ARE HOW ARE THINGS ON THAT SIDE OF CAMPUS
U JARHYN ASKS

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON MEME THEORY AND THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF EVOLUTION PARTICULARLY NEO-LAMARCKIAN OR EMETIC EVOLUTION WITHIN THE REALM OF ETHICS AND HOW THE THIS IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ETHICS AND GAME THEORY

ALAS I KNOW ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT THAT BUT IT SOUNDS INTERESTING
HI DR PURYEAR THANKS FOR TAKING TIME OUT TO DO THIS I'M ACTUALLY JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM YOU IN DURHAM WORKING ON MY MASTERS

I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS ON EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM I DON'T HAVE A PHILOSOPHY BACKGROUND AT ALL BUT EA REALLY STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME AFTER READING DR THE MOST GOOD YOU CAN DO I NOW PLAN ON DONATING AT LEAST OF MY SALARY AFTER GRADUATING AND BECOMING EMPLOYED TO DEMONSTRABLY EFFECTIVE CHARITIES I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME PHILOSOPHICAL CRITICISMS OF EA AND DR SINGER BUT I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU THOUGHT

THANKS AGAIN

U BALROGATH ASKS

WHICH SHIP IS THESEUS

HMM IF THE ORIGINAL PARTS ARE REASSEMBLED THEN I WOULD SAY THAT THE REASSEMBLED SHIP IS THESEUS AFTER ALL THEY ARE VERY BOARDS HE STOOD ON THEN AGAIN THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT THESEUS SHIP BEGAN TO EXIST A SECOND TIME WHEREAS LOCKE SAYS THAT A THING CAN ONLY BEGIN TO EXIST ONCE SO I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT PERHAPS THIS IS ALL JUST CONVENTIONAL AND THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE FACT OF THE MATTER ABOUT WHICH SHIP IS THESEUS

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE CHINESE ROOM

I FIND IT PERSUASIVE THE MERE FACT THAT A SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE INTELLIGENT ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS DOES NOT SHOW THAT IT HAS UNDERSTANDING OR EVEN CONSCIOUSNESS

U ASKS

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE HUMAN MIND IS CAPABLE OF MANIFESTING ITS THOUGHTS AND DESIRES INTO REALITY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU THINK HARD ENOUGH ON SOMETHING YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY WILL IT INTO EXISTENCE

NOT DIRECTLY NUMBER
U HAIRLOSSSKINGAIN ASKS

COULD YOU SHORTLY EXPLAIN NOMADIC INTERACTION DO YOU SEE A CONNECTION BETWEEN LEIBNIZ PYTHAGORAS AND SPINOZA DO THEY SHARE A SIMILAR NOTION OF MONAD

I'M GUESSING YOU MEAN MONADIC INTERACTION I ACTUALLY KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT NOMADIC INTERACTION THOUGH I SUPPOSE IT'S PROBABLY RARE

IN A NUTSHELL MONADIC INTERACTION REFERS TO ATTEMPT TO ACCOMMODATE OUR ORDINARY BELIEVE THAT SUBSTANCES CAUSALLY INTERACT BY SAYING THAT EACH SUBSTANCES IN A WAY INDIRECTLY CAUSES STATES IN OTHER SUBSTANCES BY GIVING GOD REASONS TO CREATE THOSE STATES THIS ISN'T CAUSATION IN THE STRICT SENSE WHICH LEIBNIZ THINKS MUST BE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE BUT LOOSELY SPEAKING HE'S WILLING TO RECOGNIZE IT AS A KIND OF CAUSATION

THERE ARE OF COURSE MANY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ANY TWO PHILOSOPHERS BUT LEIBNIZ AND SPINOZA DIFFER ON MANY THINGS TWO LEIBNIZ WAS HIMSELF SHARPLY CRITICAL OF MANY OF CENTRAL DOCTRINES IT'S HARDER TO SAY WITH PYTHAGORAS SINCE WE DON'T KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT THE CLOSEST THING TO A MONAD IN SPINOZA WOULD BE THE ONE SUBSTANCE BUT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MONADS LEIBNIZ AFFIRMS
U CLEMEN ASKS

IF WE BUILD AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS CAPABLE OF SIMULATING HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AND BEHAVIOURS CAN IT BE CONSIDERED A HUMAN OR ALIVE FOR THAT MATTER

IF IT MERELY SIMULATES BEHAVIORS INCLUDING WHAT WE THINK OF AS CONSCIOUS BEHAVIORS SUCH AS TALKING AND CRYING THEN I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES IT HUMAN OR CONSCIOUS OR EVEN ALIVE
U AUSLESE ASKS

WITH THE LIMITATION OF LANGUAGE AND FACTS AND SCIENCE ECT ECT HOW WERE SOME OF THE EARLIEST PHILOSOPHIES SO ACCURATE TO TODAY

SOME OF THESE QUOTES ALONG WITH THE DATES ARE FASCINATING TO ME

I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THESE PHILOSOPHERS PENETRATED THE NATURE OF SAME THINGS WHOSE NATURE WE ARE STILL REFLECTING ON AND LEARNING ABOUT TODAY LUCRETIUS ON THE NATURE OF THINGS IS MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE OF AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER WHO ANTICIPATED MODERN BELIEFS


HAYA I SAW YOU RECOMMEND ESSAYS AND APHORISMS ELSEWHERE WHAT'S WOULD BE THE SECOND WORK OF HIS TO WRESTLE WITH
HOW DO WE KNOW OUR REALITY ISN'T JUST AN EXTENDED DREAM HOW DO WE KNOW IT ISN'T ALL JUST IN OUR MINDS
DID YOU CONSCIOUSLY CHOOSE TO FOCUS YOUR STUDIES ON THE GREAT OPTIMIST LEIBNIZ AND THE GREAT PESSIMIST SCHOPENHAUER I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN INTERESTING CONTRAST

I READ IN A PREVIOUS POST OF YOURS WHERE YOU TALKED ABOUT WHERE YOUR INTEREST IN LEIBNIZ CAME FROM WHAT INTERESTED YOU IN SCHOPENHAUER

COOL AMA THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS
RECENTLY NEWT GINGRICH SAID THAT FACTS AND FIGURES ARE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT VOTERS FEEL TO BE TRUE I BELIEVE THIS SPEAKS TO WHAT COULD BE CALLED A LOW THRESHOLD FOR BELIEF AMONG HIS UNFORTUNATE CONSTITUENTS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY CONSTITUTES YOUR THRESHOLD FOR BELIEF AND DO YOU THINK ONE OF THE GOALS OF A PHILOSOPHER SHOULD BE TO PROSTHELETYZE FOR WHAT THEY VIEW TO BE THE APPROPRIATE THRESHOLD
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO EMOTIVISM WHICH STATES THAT MORAL PROPOSITIONS DO NOT EXPRESS PROPOSITIONS BUT MORAL ATTITUDES FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE TO ASSERT MURDER TO BE MORALLY WRONG ARE YOU REALLY NOT JUST ASSERTING YOUR DISLIKE FOR MURDER AND THAT IS ALL
HEY WOULD YOU HELP ME WITH MY HOMEWORK
IF YOU GOT A CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS TOO PROFESSOR RICHARD DAWKINS RICHARD SWINBURNE AND DR JAMES CARLETON PAGET WHAT WOULD THEY BE

I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTRIGUED BY PHILOSOPHY SINCE MY FIRST PHILOSOPHY CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL WANT TO LEARN MORE BUT DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND
COULD YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOUR BOOK ON IDEALISM IS IT PRIMARILY HISTORICAL OR DO YOU THINK IT'S A DEFENSIBLE METAPHYSICAL POSITION WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF AN IDEALIST
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PURYEAR FOR DOING THIS

MY QUESTION IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PRACTICAL I'D LOVE TO KNOW HOW DO YOU APPROACH A PAPER THAT YOU WANT TO DO

CURRENTLY I'M STUDYING LAWS AND RECENTLY I MADE A LITTLE PAPER FOR A CONGRESS ON BIOETHICS I TALKED ABOUT THE PLACE THAT LAW HAS ON THE DISCUSSION OF BIOETHICS WHAT I REALIZED DOING THIS MY FIRST WORK OF THIS NATURE IS THAT IT CAN BE QUITE DIFFICULT TO START INVESTIGATING AND THEN TO HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT THE TOPIC THAT FEELS LIKE WAS ACTUALLY THOUGHT BY ONESELF I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT I FELT PRETTY SATISFIED WHILE DOING IT AND I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DO DECENT PAPERS IN THE FUTURE EVEN AS A HOBBY IF MY CAREER PATH DOESN'T END IN ACADEMIA

SO I'D LOVE TO KNOW HOW DO YOU DO IT WHAT ARE SOME KEYS THAT YOU FOLLOW TO MAKE A DECENT PAPER

FINALLY BECAUSE I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT IT I'D LOVE TO KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE THAT JORGE LUIS BORGES WAS A PHILOSOPHER AS WELL AS A WRITER EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER WROTE PROPER PHILOSOPHY BUT ONLY STORIES AND POETRY IS IT POSSIBLE TO DO PHILOSOPHY GOOD PHILOSOPHY BEING A WRITER OF FICTIONS I EAST NOT DOING ANY FORMAL PHILOSOPHY PAPERS

EDIT ADDED A COUPLE OF SENTENCES TO MAKE IT CLEARER AND SPELLING
HI DR PURYEAR

I ACTUALLY TOOK A CLASS FROM YOU IN UNDERGRAD IT WAS EITHER ETHICS OR EARLY MODERN CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH OR MAYBE BOTH NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT I DO REMEMBER THAT IT WAS A GREAT CLASSICAL

I REMEMBER YOU MENTIONING THAT YOU HAD TRANSITIONED FROM AN ENGINEERING CAREER INTO PHILOSOPHY SO FROM A CAREER STANDPOINT WHERE DO YOU SEE THE ROLE OF ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY CURRENTLY AND IN THE NEAR FUTURE ARE PHILOSOPHY PROGRAMS DOING ENOUGH TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE REAL WORLD HOW MUCH DO PHILOSOPHY PROFESSORS HATE HEARING THAT QUESTION DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE IS STILL VALUE IN STUDYING PHILOSOPHY

FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DO BELIEVE THERE IS VALUE BUT I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR YOUR TAKE ON IT
HELLO PROFESSOR PURYEAR I WAS ENROLLED AT ACSU AS AN UNDERGRADUATE AND YOUR CLASSES WERE SOME OF MY FAVORITE ELECTIVES YOU ARE AN ENGAGING AND ENTERTAINING TEACHER I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT ASKING FOR ESSAYS AND APHORISMS FOR CHRISTMAS CAN YOU RECOMMEND IT
DEAR PROFESSOR I'D LIKE TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SCHOPENHAUER IS HIS PHILOSOPHY STILL TRUE SOME ALLEGE THAT HIS UNDERSTANDING OF KANT WAS SHALLOW IS THAT TRUE DOES NIETZSCHE REALLY REFUTE HIS PHILOSOPHY OR DOES IT STILL STAND AND FINALLY IS A NATURALISTIC INTERPRETATION OF HIS PHILOSOPHY POSSIBLE WHERE WILL IS PHYSICAL STUFF THANK YOU
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT IS GEARING TOWARDS A CERTAIN TREND IN THE FUTURE OR THAT PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS WILL REMAIN TO BE AS DIVERSE AS THEY ARE TODAY PERHAPS EVEN DIVERSIFY EVEN MORE AMONG THE SCHOLARS AND GENERAL POPULATION

SCHOPENHAUER SAID SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES I HATE GERMANS AND I'M ASHAMED FOR BEING ONE OF THEM

IS PROTECTING CARING FOR YOURSELF AND THEREFORE SOCIALLY OTHERS BY EXTENSION OF EMPATHY AND SYMPATHY AN IMPERATIVE OF LIFE
WHAT IS GOING ON IN NC THAT IT KEEPS SHOWING UP IN THE NEWS FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT
HEY

GREAT TO SEE YOU ON HERE I HAD YOU FOR PHILOSOPHY A COUPLE YEARS AGO I WAS THE ANNOYING ECON NERD WHO SAT CLOSE TO YOUR DESK

YOU DESCRIBED YOURSELF AS SOME SORT OF CONSEQUALITIST IN CLASS BUT I FOUND IT HARD TO PRESS YOU ON THE MATTER DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK THERE IS SUCH THING AS A UTIL THAT CAN LEAD TO ACTIONABLE MORAL PHILOSOPHY RATHER THEN A THOUGHT DEVICE

IF SO HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO EFFICIENCY

PAGE SOUTH YOUR SLIDERS WERE IMPECCABLY FORMATTED ALSO YOU MADE ME RESPECT THE HELL OUT OF HUME WITH THE WILL THE SUN RISE TOMORROW


I KNOW I'M LATE BUT PLEASE ANSWER ME THIS

IS IT ETHICAL TO DISPEL SOMEONE'S UNFOUNDED BELIEF IN SOMETHING IF THE BELIEF IS CENTRAL TO THEIR WELL-BEING

THANK YOU SO MUCH
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LOST PAGES OF LETTER ON NEGATION THAT HEGEL USES FOR HIS DEPARTURE THE EVERY DETERMINATION IS A NEGATION
DO YOU FAVOR A HEGELIAN OR DELEUZIAN SPINOZA OR ANY OTHER KIND

THE QUESTION HERE IS WHAT YOU THINK OF THE POINT WHERE MOST RATIONALISM BREAKS DOWN ON THE TRANSITION BETWEEN INFINITE AND FINITE ESPECIALLY IN ITS EPISTEMOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
PERHAPS THIS IS A STRANGE AND IGNORANT QUESTION BUT WHAT IS IT THAT DRAWS YOU TO LEIBNIZ WHAT IS THERE THAT WE CAN STILL LEARN FROM LEIBNIZ
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD WHY OR WHY NOT

THANKS
I HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH YOUR AMA YET BUT I'M INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY I HAVEN'T FORMALLY STUDIED MUCH OF IT ONLY A FEW CLASSES WHEN I GET TIME THOUGH

I'M INTERESTED IN THE ONTOLOGY OF TIME WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS WITH REGARD TO TIME I'M SPECIFICALLY CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE B THEORY OF TIME PROBLEMS RELATED TO IT COMPARED WITH THE A THEORY OF TIME BASICALLY WORK

PERSONALLY I DON'T SEE HOW THE A THEORY PRESENTIST CAN MATCH UP WITH THE DISCOVERY OF RELATIVITY SIMULTANEOUS PRESENTS WITHOUT ASSUMING ALL OF OUR METHODS OF TESTING RELATIVITY ARE INCORRECT IN SOME WAY I THINK THIS ASSUMPTION IS MISGUIDED IT'S JUST CLAWING ON TO PRESENTIST

BUT AGAIN I'M NOT REALLY ALL THAT WELL READ ON THE TOPIC
IF THE GREATEST TRUTHS IN LIFE ARE SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS THEN WHY DOES MANKIND SO HEAVILY PRIORITIZE THE OBJECTIVE FIRST
HEY MAYBE TOO SPECIFIC OR SOMETHING THAT YOU DONT FIND INTERESTING BUT WORTH THE TRY I RECENTLY WROTE MY IB EXTENDED ESSAY ON HUME S DEONTOLOGICAL DEFENSE OF SUICIDE IN ON SUICIDE I FOUND HIS ARGUMENTS INTERESTING AND DID SOME READING ESPECIALLY CIOBAN WHOM I FOUND TOTALLY MESMERIZING DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HIS APPROACH OR CAN YOU POINT ME TOWARDS SOME FURTHER READING ON THE PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUE OF SUICIDE THANKS

GOOD DAY SO IF OUR SOUL OR CONSCIOUSNESS IS THEORETICALLY ON ANOTHER FREQUENCY OF ENERGY AND WE ARE QUANTUM IN TANGLED WITH OUR BRAINS THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ISN'T ANY USE FOR MATERIAL AND THAT THE THEORY OF SIMULATION IS ACTUALLY MORE POSSIBLE IF WE ARE ON ANOTHER FREQUENCY IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS AND THAT OUR SOUL OR CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN INTER DIMENSIONAL ANOMALY SO THEORETICALLY IF YOU REMEMBER SOMETHING IN YOUR PAST YOU ARE ACTUALLY ACCESSING THAT PART OF YOUR PAST AS IF YOU WERE EXPERIENCING IT IN THAT MOMENT AS TIME WOULD BE IRRELEVANT TO AN INTER DIMENSIONAL ANOMALY
BUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS WHAT DOES NOT FIT IN
IS IT TOO LATE TO ASK ABOUT MONADS
I AM LOOKING FOR AN ABSOLUTE SYNTHESIS FOR THE FOLLOWING TWO UNIVERSALLY CORRECT AXIOMS CAN YOU HELP

POWER IS ALWAYS INDETERMINATE
2 THERE IS NO CAUSATION ONLY CORRELATION
DO YOU THINK THE SCIENCES OF CHAOS AND QUANTUM PHYSICS WILL EVENTUALLY GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOT NEED THE CONCEPT OF GOD ANYMORE
I'D APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE TO A QUESTION I'VE POSTED ON ASKPHILOSOPHY

THE WORD RIGHT IS DEFINED BY AS A MORAL OR LEGAL ENTITLEMENT TO HAVE OR DO SOMETHING

HOWEVER FIRST A LEGAL ENTITLEMENT IS ESSENTIALLY A PRIVILEGE THAT CAN BE CREATED GIVEN AND TAKEN AWAY SECOND IT IS AMORAL AS WHAT IS LEGAL MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE WHAT IS MORAL AND AND THIRD IT SUPERSEDES ANY MORAL ENTITLEMENT DUE TO BEING ENFORCEABLE BY LAW

AS SUCH DOESN'T THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF A RIGHT ACTUALLY DENY ACTUAL AND ABSOLUTE MORAL RIGHTS REPLACING THEM INSTEAD WITH AMORAL LEGAL PRIVILEGES BY THIS I MEAN BOTH IN A PRACTICAL SENSE AND IN THE MINDS OF THE MASSES EAST G CONFUSING AND EQUATING RIGHTS WITH PRIVILEGES

I WOULD TEND TO SAY THAT A GOVERNMENTS PRIVILEGES ARE GIVEN THROUGH CONSENT OF THE MAJORITY THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN ABOUT BEING AT DINNER AND HAVING YOUR MAJORITY OF FRIENDS EXPECT YOU TO PAY THE WHOLE BILL I THINK IS UNFAIR A BETTER EXPECTATION WOULD FOR YOU TO PAY A FRACTION OF THE BILL IN WHICH CASE I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE MORALLY OBLIGATED TO DO SO HOWEVER THERE STILL IS NO WAY TO REALLY OPT OUT AS WAS MENTIONED SHORT OF EMIGRATING FROM THE COUNTRY

THIS SHOULD BE HIGHER IT'S BUT READ IT THROUGH THE METAPHORICAL ANALYSIS OF INORGANIC PERCEPTION IS FASCINATING
DANIT SORRY I ONLY JUST NOW NOTICED THAT I MISTYPED DENNETT IN THE TITLE
I KNOW IS FASHIONABLE TO BASH DEAD HORSE FREUD BUT INTERPRETATION OF PSYCHOANALYSIS SEEMS INTENTIONALLY DECEPTIVE

HE WANTS TO PROPOSE A DREAM MODEL THAT IS RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PSYCHOANALYTICAL ONE BUT BOTH MODELS HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN HE CLAIMS IF NOTHING ELSE IT LEAVES THE MOST RELEVANT ASPECTS OF THEORY UNTOUCHED THE EXTRAVAGANT HYPOTHESIS OF AN INTERNAL DREAM PLAYWRIGHT COMPOSING THERAPEUTIC FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE EGO IS AN UNFAIR STRAWMAN DREAMS DON'T HAVE ANY THERAPEUTIC PURPOSE AND ARE NOT THERE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE EGO ACCORDING TO PSYCHOANALYSIS

IN FACT GAME IS A NICE METAPHOR OF MODEL THERE'S NO NEED FOR THE PLAYWRIGHT TO HAVE A THEORY OF ITS OWN ANXIETIES JUST TO ASK QUESTIONS MOTIVATED BY SUBCONSCIOUS DRIVES THE PARTY REPRESENTS THE CENSORSHIP WHICH ACCORDING TO DENNETT IS RANDOM BUT SINCE RANDOM IS JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR UNPREDICTABLE IT DOESN'T EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS CENSORSHIP HAS SOME KIND OF CRITERIA SUITED TO BE STUDIED IN DREAM INTERPRETATION SAYING THE DRESS WAS RED IS AS MEANINGFUL AS SAYING THE DRESS WASN'T RED THEY BOTH ARISE FROM THE SAME SUBCONSCIOUS DRIVE OR EXPECTATION ALTHOUGH THEY REVEAL SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THE CENSOR

THE MODELS OF PERCEPTION DENNETT MENTIONS ONLY STRENGTHEN THE ADEQUACY OF THE PSYCHOANALYTICAL MODEL WHEN WE'RE ASLEEP THE EXPECTATION SIDE PRODUCES MOST OF THE CONTENT JUST LIKE IN A SENSORY DEPRIVATION EXPERIMENT SINCE THERE'S ABOUT NOTHING TO CONFIRM AGAINST OTHER THAN THE CENSORSHIP DENNETT MENTIONS A LINK BETWEEN THE CONTENT OF THE DREAM AND THE EMOTIONAL STATE OF THE HALLUCINATOR WHICH DOESN'T EXCLUDE BUT IN FACT SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS CONTENT BEING PRODUCED BY SUBCONSCIOUS DRIVES

HE LATER CLAIMS THAT THERE'S NO AUTHOR AT ALL WHICH CAN ONLY BE INTERPRETED AS THE CONTENTS BEING PURELY RANDOM AND THEREFORE HAVING NO LINK AT ALL TO THE EMOTIONAL STATE OF THE SUBJECT BUT THIS CLAIM COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AS THE WHOLE TEXT ESPECIALLY THE GAME METAPHOR POINTS TOWARDS THERE BEING A VERY CREATIVE AUTHOR ALTHOUGH NOT A CONSCIOUS ONE

OUR SERVERS ARE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING MAINTENANCE
THE CONTENT HAS BEEN FOUND IT WILL BE AVAILABLE AGAIN SOON
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE
WHILE I GET THE POINT HE IS TRYING TO MAKE IT IS PRETTY EASY TO CREATE A HALLUCINATION THAT ENCOMPASSES ALL OF PERCEIVED REALITY PUMPING LSD OR ACP INTO THE BRAIN WOULD DO IT YOU WON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE HALLUCINATION BUT IT WOULD FEEL REAL FOR AS LONG AS YOU KEPT PUMPING LSD INTO THE SYSTEM ANOTHER ROUTE WOULD SIMPLY BE TO DEACTIVATE THE PART OF THE BRAIN WHICH DETERMINES IF SOMETHING IS WRONG ERROR DETECTION IS A TASK DEVOTED TO A SPECIFIC PART OF THE BRAIN DEACTIVATE IT AND THE SUBJECT WILL NEVER REALIZE ANYTHING IS AMISS EVER NOTHING WILL EVER SEEM STRANGE ODD OR OUT OF PLACE IN THIS WAY NO MATTER HOW BADLY YOU SIMULATE REALITY THE SUBJECT WILL NEVER REALIZE THERE IS A PROBLEM AND JUST AORTA ROLL WITH IT LIKE IN A DREAM UNTIL YOU WAKE UP

HERE'S AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF AYN COMPLETE LACK OF NUANCED PHILOSOPHICAL ACUMEN AT WHERE SHE HIGHLIGHTS ARISTOTLE AS THE DEFENDER OF REASON AND PLATO AS THE OPPOSITE RAND MIGHT BE A GOOD STARTING PLACE TO GET SOME PEOPLE INSPIRED ABOUT I ADMIT SHE WAS FOR THAT'S ALL SHE WILL EVER BE
THIS CRITIQUE OF AYN RAND A FEW YEARS BACK IS AN EXCELLENT READ THROUGH I WOULD LIKE THE OPS THOUGHT ON IT

R PHILOSOPHY COMMENTS AVM Z
AT ABOUT AYN RAND SAID SHE DOESN'T WONDER WHEN SHE LOOKS AT THE STARS SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO LOOK AT THEM SHE'S BEING INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST OR AT LEAST CLOSE MINDED THERE SHE BACKED HERSELF INTO A CORNER
REMOVED
I FEEL THAT FROM WHAT I'VE READ WHICH IS MOST OF THE FOUNTAINHEAD FINISHING IT SOON IS THAT SHE PLACES A SPECIFIC FASCINATION ON THE GIFTED PEOPLE AS WELL AS THE FREEDOM OF CREATIVITY AND THAT OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE CONSTRICTING STUDENT'S THOUGHTS AND CREATIVITY INTO A FUNNEL THAT ADEQUATELY ALIGNS WITH SPECIFIC SOCIOECONOMIC BOUNDARIES THE RESULT IS THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS OF ACADEMICS GRADUATING WITH VERY LITTLE TO OFFER IN TERMS OF INGENUITY AND CREATIVITY I BELIEVE SHE THINKS THAT NOWADAYS WE SET OUR LEGISLATION AND EDUCATION TO BE ADEQUATE TO SUSTAIN THE LOWEST DENOMINATOR IN SOCIETY INSTEAD OF DEVELOPING LEGISLATION AND EDUCATION DEDICATED TO RAISING THE LOWEST DENOMINATOR
SO FIRST OFF TURING WASN'T TESTING FOR OTHER MINDS HE WAS TESTING FOR INTELLIGENCES HIS TEST DOESN'T FAIL BECAUSE DREAM CHARACTERS CAN PASS IT BECAUSE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY USING YOUR INTELLIGENCE I'LL TAKE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT THE OPINIONS ON THIS TOPIC FROM SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE TURING TEST TESTS

SECOND THE WHOLE POINT OF QUALIA IS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD A PHENOMENAL BRIDGE SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS DISCUSSION IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW
DONT TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY BUT WHY DOES EVIDENCE FOR THE SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR CONSCIOUSNESS B MAY JUST BE A VERY SMART COMPUTER WHO USED THAT DATA IN YOUR MIND TO CONSTRUCT THE SOLUTION
DELETED
SO I CAN USE MAGIC THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST TO TEST FOR OTHER MAGIC THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST

THAT'S NOT REALLY PHILOSOPHY THAT'S MENTAL MASTURBATION AT BEST

WHAT'S HIS NEXT ARTICLE GOING TO BE ABOUT HOW YOU CAN USE A POTION OF DRAGON'S BLOOD AND THE GROUND BONES OF A SPIDER TO GAIN THE ABILITY TO SEE UNICORNS
I THINK I MIGHT BE MISSING SOMETHING BUT WHY IS ANY OF THE MINDMELDING NECESSARY IF BEING ABLE TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE INDICATES CONSCIOUSNESS THEN CAN'T A JUST ADMINISTER THE TEST TO B IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD FASHION
WHY DOES EVERYONE PRESUME THAT THEY ARE CONSCIOUS OR THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS MIND
WHAT IS A PHENOMENAL PUZZLE THAT'S WHERE I STUMBLED

FOR EXAMPLE A PHENOMENAL PUZZLE IS TO ARRANGE QUALIA VALUES OF PHENOMENAL COLOR IN A LINEAR MAP WHERE THE METRIC IS BASED ON SUBJECTIVE JUST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES

ALL BEINGS CONSCIOUS OR NOT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS JUST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IS A FUNCTION OF PERCEPTION BUT HOW DOES THIS SAY ANYTHING ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS

TURING TEST OR ANY OTHER TEST FOR CONCIOUSNESS FAILS AS AN EMPIRICAL TOOL BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE AN EMPIRICAL DEFINITION OF WHAT CONCIOUSNESS IS AND AS WAS SAID BEFORE TURING DID NOT DESIGN HIS TEST FOR CONCIOUSNESS NOR DID HE CONSIDER THE QUESTION CAN MACHINES THINK PRODUCTIVE WITH OUR CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE ASKING WETHER A MACHINE IS CONSCIOUS IS LIKE ASKING IF SUBMARINES SWIM IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU CALL SWIMMING THIS IS A PROBLEM OF SEMANTICS RATHER THAN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE TO INVENT A PUZZLE THAT REQUIRES QUALIA TO SOLVE THAT WOULD BE LIKE A PUZZLE THAT REQUIRES THE GREENNESS OF GREEN OR THE SENSATION OF SWEETNESS FROM SOMETHING SWEET I CANNOT POSSIBLE THINK OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO OPERATE THIS WAY

WITH A WOULDN'T THE BRIDGE TRANSLATE THE QUALIA ANYWAYS MAYBE B'S GREEN LOOKS RED AND A'S GREEN LOOKS GREEN WHEN THEY MELD TOGETHER THE BRIDGE WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO TRANSMIT GREEN NOT THE PERCEIVED GREENNESS OF THAT GREEN THEN WHEN B VIEWS WHAT A WOULD PERCEIVE AS GREEN B WOULD STILL SEE IT GREEN RATHER THAN RED

THIS WOULD MORE ACCURATELY BE DESCRIBED AS EITHER THE LOST ART OF DEMOCRATIC DEBATE IN THE USA OF THE CENTURY OR THE LOST ART OF DEBATE THAT WE THINK USED TO BE COMMON BUT ACTUALLY WASN'T

GO WATCH ANY DEMOCRATIC DEBATE IN EUROPE ESPECIALLY THE NORDIC COUNTRIES THEY TAKE THE HIGH ROAD COMPARED TO US AND IT'S A STARK DIFFERENCE FROM THE US VS THEM RHETORIC WE SEE HERE TODAY IN THE US BY CONTRAST READ SURVIVING DEBATES FROM CLASSICAL GREECE OR THE ROMAN REPUBLIC MANY ARE NO MORE CRASS AND VULGAR THAN THE ELECTION WE JUST SAW

PEOPLE ROMANTICIZE HISTORY WITHOUT BOTHERING TO SAMPLE IT THEMSELVES FOR COMPARISON WHAT WE FORGET IS THAT SURVIVING CLASSICS AND TEXTS USUALLY ONLY SURVIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCEPTIONALLY EMINENT TRANSCENDING TIME AND CULTURE NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE TYPICAL
SO IF YOU CAN HAVE HARVARD STUDENTS FANCY TESTERS PARTICIPATE IN A POSSIBLY CIVIL DISCUSSION MODERATED BY A PROFESSOR WHO CONTROLS THE MIC IT WILL WORK IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THE WORLD GOOD LUCK WITH THAT
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO SAY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY OF A SUFFICIENTLY COMPLEX AND FLEXIBLE COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK IT'S EQUIVALENT TO SAYING CONSCIOUSNESS IS JUST WHAT BRAINS DO BUT FAR MORE USEFUL

IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAYING THE UNIVERSE BEGAN AND WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE HOW AND GOD DID IT NO NEED TO LOOK ANY FURTHER IT MAKES NO SENSE
ANYTIME SOMEONE TRIES TO EXPRESS THAT SOMETHING IS ACTUALLY NOTHING I TUNE OUT TAKES ME BACK TO BEING AND VERY SMART

ALSO IN THIS CONTEXT IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE SOME ATHEIST TECHNOCRAT THREW THE TOWEL IN BUT CLAIMED HE WON
CONSCIOUSNESS IS SOMETHING
2 CLAIMING A COMPUTER TO BE CONSCIOUS IS SAYING THAT WE KNOW WHAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT SAY SOMETHING THAT WE DO NOT KNOW
THEREFORE WE CANNOT AS OF YET EVEN MAKE A CLAIM THAT A COMPUTER WILL BE CONSCIOUS

I DON'T THINK I CAN FOLLOW THIS THE ARGUMENT IS BASICALLY THAT WE CANNOT ASCRIBE A PROPERTY TO AN OBJECT IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROPERTY IS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE AUTHOR PRESUPPOSES THE FACT THAT HUMANS OTHER LIFE FORMS ARE CONSCIOUS FURTHERMORE WE ASCRIBE UNKNOWN TRAITS OR PERCEPTIONS TO OBJECTS ALL THE TIME CONSIDER THIS QUOTE FROM THE AUTHOR

MISUNDERSTANDING CAN COME INTO THE ARGUMENT WHEN A TERM IS NOT USED UNIVERSALLY

IF MY FRIEND AND I WERE LOOKING AT A BOOK AND I SAID THAT THE BOOK WAS PURPLE AND HE AGREED WITH ME IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE WE'VE COME TO A CONSENSUS BUT PURPLE IS AN ABSTRACT SYMBOL MADE TO REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL PERCEPTION PURPLE HAS ROOTS IN THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE BOOK IT MIGHT TEND TO REFLECT LIGHT AROUND IN WAVELENGTH BUT DUE TO ANY VARYING DEGREE OF COLORBLINDNESS OR DIFFERENCES IN OUR BRAIN WE MAY BE ATTRIBUTING DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS TO THE OBJECT JUST AS THE TWO PEOPLE ATTRIBUTED DIFFERENT MEANINGS TO THE WORD BOOK IN THE AUTHOR'S EXAMPLE BUT IN THE AUTHOR'S EXAMPLE ONE PERSON WAS WRONG BUT IN MY EXAMPLE NEITHER ONE IS THERE MAY NOT BE A PROBLEM AT ALL IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE SITUATION IS MORE NUANCED THAN THE AUTHOR RECOGNIZES

CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOTHING
2 CLAIMING A COMPUTER TO BE CONSCIOUS IS SAYING NOTHING
THEREFORE A COMPUTER WILL NEVER BE CONSCIOUS

THIS FEELS LIKE AN EQUIVOCATION TO ME BUT HONESTLY I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THIS ARGUMENT ANYWAY THIS QUOTE CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP CLARIFY THE MATTER

THE PROPERTY OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS THEN SOMETHING WITHOUT VALUE THE PRESENT KING OF FRANCE IS A NON-EXISTENT CONCEPT AN EMPTY CONCEPT

IT SEEMS LIKE THE AUTHOR IS EQUATING THE CONCEPTS OF AND I REALLY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT HERE
AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THE AZTECS HAD THEIR OWN EUDAEMONIC HAPPINESS DIRECTED PHILOSOPHY THE ARTICLE IS ALMOST COMPLETELY UNSOURED EXCEPT FOR THE REFERENCE TO A SINGLE POEM THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE ARGUMENT IS THERE ANY PRIMARY TEXT EVIDENCE OR IS THIS ALL A LATER PROJECTION
THE AUTHOR OPPOSES THE AZTEC ETHICISTS TO ARISTOTLE AND THIS RECEIVED WESTERN WISDOM ABOUT THE GOOD LIFE BUT THEY SEEM REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO ARISTOTLE AND TO OTHER BRANCHES OF HELLENISTIC ETHICS THE STOICS FOR EXAMPLE COUNTED JOY AS A DISTURBANCE OF THE SOUL ALONG WITH LUST AND FEAR AND CONCENTRATED ON BEING ACTIVE AND VIRTUOUS FOR THE STOICS PLEASURE WAS LITTLE MORE THAN AN INCIDENTAL FEATURE JUST AS THE AUTHOR SAYS ABOUT THE AZTECS I WOULD AGREE THAT AZTEC ETHICS AS DESCRIBED BY PURCELL IS OPPOSED TO THE IDEA OF HAPPINESS WE GET FROM CONTEMPORARY ADVERTISING BUT IT SEEMS TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO MOST WESTERN PHILOSOPHICAL ETHICS THIS IS LIKELY BECAUSE THE AZTEC PHILOSOPHERS JUST LIKE WESTERN PHILOSOPHERS WERE WRITING IN OPPOSITION TO PREVALENT OPINION

PURCELL SEEMS TO BE USING THE WORD HAPPINESS TO MEAN JOY A PARTICULAR EMOTIONAL STATE HE SAYS WE DON T PLAN OUR LIVES AROUND ELEVATED EMOTIONAL STATES WHAT WE WANT ARE WORTHWHILE LIVES AND IF WE HAVE TO MAKE SACRIFICES FOR THAT THEN SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR HAPPINESS BUT THIS IS EXACTLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HELLENISTIC CONCEPT OF EUDAIMONIA AND THE CONCEPT OF HAPPINESS AS JOY EUDAIMONIA DOES NOT DESCRIBE A PARTICULAR EMOTIONAL STATE BUT RATHER A CONDITION OF LIFE THRIVING WELL-BEING AND LEADING THE BEST KIND OF LIFE FOR A HUMAN PURCELL SAYS WHAT THE AZTEC PHILOSOPHERS REALLY WANTED TO KNOW WAS HOW IS ONE SUPPOSED TO LIVE GIVEN THAT PAIN AND TRANSIENCE ARE INESCAPABLE FEATURES OF OUR CONDITION THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME QUESTION THAT IS AT THE HEART OF HELLENISTIC ETHICS AND IS PARTICULARLY CENTRAL TO THE STOICS AND EPICUREANS

PURCELL ALSO SAYS THAT UNLIKE ARISTOTLE THEY DID NOT START WITH THE HUMAN ABILITY TO REASON RATHER THEY LOOKED OUTWARD TO OUR CIRCUMSTANCES ON EARTH IT'S TRUE THAT ARISTOTLE DID GIVE PRIMACY TO REASON BUT HE REASONED FROM OBSERVED CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE HERE'S BOOK CHAPTER OF THE NICOMACHEAN ETHICS FOR EXAMPLE

LET US RESUME OUR INQUIRY AND STATE IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE AND EVERY PURSUIT AIMS AT SOME GOOD WHAT IT IS THAT WE SAY POLITICAL SCIENCE AIMS AT AND WHAT IS THE HIGHEST OF ALL GOODS ACHIEVABLE BY ACTION VERBALLY THERE IS VERY GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR BOTH THE GENERAL RUN OF MEN AND PEOPLE OF SUPERIOR REFINEMENT SAY THAT IT IS HAPPINESS AND IDENTIFY LIVING WELL AND DOING WELL WITH BEING HAPPY BUT WITH REGARD TO WHAT HAPPINESS IS THEY DIFFER AND THE MANY DO NOT GIVE THE SAME ACCOUNT AS THE WISE FOR THE FORMER THINK IT IS SOME PLAIN AND OBVIOUS THING LIKE PLEASURE WEALTH OR HONOUR THEY DIFFER HOWEVER FROM ONE ANOTHER AND OFTEN EVEN THE SAME MAN IDENTIFIES IT WITH DIFFERENT THINGS WITH HEALTH WHEN HE IS ILL WITH WEALTH WHEN HE IS POOR BUT CONSCIOUS OF THEIR IGNORANCE THEY ADMIRE THOSE WHO PROCLAIM SOME GREAT IDEAL THAT IS ABOVE THEIR COMPREHENSION NOW SOME THOUGHT THAT APART FROM THESE MANY GOODS THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH IS SELF-SUBSISTENT AND CAUSES THE GOODNESS OF ALL THESE AS WELL TO EXAMINE ALL THE OPINIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HELD WERE PERHAPS SOMEWHAT FRUITLESS ENOUGH TO EXAMINE THOSE THAT ARE MOST PREVALENT OR THAT SEEM TO BE ARGUABLE

LET US NOT FAIL TO NOTICE HOWEVER THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARGUMENTS FROM AND THOSE TO THE FIRST PRINCIPLES FOR PLATO TOO WAS RIGHT IN RAISING THIS QUESTION AND ASKING AS HE USED TO DO ARE WE ON THE WAY FROM OR TO THE FIRST PRINCIPLES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AS THERE IS IN A RACE-COURSE BETWEEN THE COURSE FROM THE JUDGES TO THE AND THE WAY BACK FOR WHILE WE MUST BEGIN WITH WHAT IS KNOWN THINGS ARE OBJECTS OF KNOWLEDGE IN TWO SENSES SOME TO US SOME WITHOUT QUALIFICATION PRESUMABLY THEN WE MUST BEGIN WITH THINGS KNOWN TO US HENCE ANY ONE WHO IS TO LISTEN INTELLIGENTLY TO LECTURES ABOUT WHAT IS NOBLE AND JUST AND GENERALLY ABOUT THE SUBJECTS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN GOOD HABITS FOR THE FACT IS THE AND IF THIS IS SUFFICIENTLY PLAIN TO HIM HE WILL NOT AT THE START NEED THE REASON AS WELL AND THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP HAS OR CAN EASILY GET STARTING POINTS
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF AZTEC ERA CODICES THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE THEY ARE IMAGES AND PICOGRAMS IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXTRACT IDEAS WITHOUT INJECTING HUGE AMOUNTS OF THE OBSERVERS BIASES

THERE ARE MANY MORE CODICES COLLECTED BY SPANISH COLONIAL PRIESTS THESE HAVE MUCH MORE INFORMATION AND THE SONGS ESPECIALLY SHED LIGHT ON WHAT PRE-COLUMBIAN LIFE AND BELIEFS WERE LIKE HOWEVER PRIESTS HAVE A LONG TRADITION OF MODIFYING INFORMATION WHILE COLLECTING IT AND INJECTING THEIR OWN WORLD-VIEW IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISENTANGLE THE IDEAS BROUGHT BY CATHOLIC PRIESTS WHO WERE ON A MISSION TO CONVERT A CONTINENT AND THE ORIGINAL BELIEFS

SONGS ARE NOTORIOUSLY EASY TO FIND PHILOSOPHICAL MESSAGES IN TEENAGERS DO A LOT OF THIS WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TAYLOR SHAKE IT OFF DOES IT SUGGEST A BUDDHIST RENUNCIATION IN THE SENSE OF MOKSHA

I FIND IT PLAUSIBLE THAT HAD A WORLD-VIEW AND A SENSE OF DESTINY AND OF FATE SIMILAR TO NORSE BELIEFS OR HOMERIC GREECE OR PRE CHRISTIAN CELTIC BELIEFS OR PRE ZOROASTRIAN MIDDLE EASTERN BELIEFS OR EARLY JUDAISM I FIND IT LESS LIKELY THAT THEY HAD MOVED BEYOND THIS INTO A FORMALIZED PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHICAL THEMES ARE EVER PRESENT IN ANCIENT MYTHS AND STORIES BUT THERE IS A CONSEQUENTIAL GAP BETWEEN TELLING STORIES WITH A THEME AND DEVELOPING A ARTICULATED THEORY OF THAT IDEA
THE ONLY PROBLEM I FOUND WITH THE ARTICLE WAS THAT AZTECS DID NOT BELIEVE GOD WAS NATURE PEYOTL IS LIKE DIVINE ESSENCE AND WHILE PEYOTL CAN BE FOUND IN NATURAL OBJECTS SUCH AS CORN AND JAGUARS THE AZTECS DID NOT BELIEVE THESE WERE GODS RATHER THE GODS IMBUED NATURAL THINGS WITH THEIR DIVINITY ALSO POWERFUL HUMANS SUCH AS KINGS AND WARRIORS HAVE PEYOTL TOO SO IT'S NOT REALLY EXCLUSIVE TO NATURE NOW I'M A BIT SKEPTICAL OF WHAT THE REST OF THE ARTICLE SAYS
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS VERY INTERESTING
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THE CORE CONCEPTS FOUND IN AZTEC RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND PHILOSOPHY TO BE FASCINATING A REALLY GREAT POST OP

FOR THOSE INTERESTED HERE IS AN ACCESSIBLE FAIRLY INCLUSIVE INTRODUCTORY BOOK THAT I OWN THAT COVERS NOT ONLY RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY BUT ALSO HOW THOSE CORE BELIEFS APPLIED PRACTICALLY TO AND SHAPED MATTERS OF WAR TRADE EDUCATION POLITICS AND SO ON IT ALSO INCLUDES SPLASHES OF MAYAN THOUGHT AND TOUCHES ON THE SOCIETIES THAT WERE LATER INCORPORATED INTO THE AZTEC EMPIRE
THE LESSON I SAW IN THE FIRST THREE PARAGRAPHS WASN'T YOU SHOULD STOP SEARCHING FOR HAPPINESS BECAUSE THAT S NOT REALLY WHAT YOU WANT BUT GOOD POINT I THINK I'LL AVOID HAVING CHILDREN

WOW THIS WAS INCREDIBLY ILLUMINATING O
IF ANYONE WANTS ME TO TRANSLATE ANY PASSAGES FROM THE FLORENTINE CODEX OR ELSEWHERE LET ME KNOW I HAVEN'T DONE THE CHAPTER ON PHILOSOPHY YET BUT I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS HOW AZTEC PHILOSOPHY IS CONSTANTLY TOUTED AROUND WITHOUT REFERENCE TO PRIMARY SOURCES

EDIT FOR INSTANCE I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IDEAS ABOUT PEYOTL ARE PULLED OUT OF HIS ASS IN THE CHAPTER ON GODS IN THE FLORENTINE CODEX PEYOTL IS USED AS WE WOULD USE GOD IT IS USED TO REFER TO THE GODS OF THE AZTEC PANTHEON LIKE HUITZILOPOCHTLI AND CERTAINLY NOT AS SOME KIND OF HOLISTIC DYNAMIC FORCE OR WHATEVER DAFFIE GOES ON ABOUT IN HIS WORK DAFFIE ALSO CONSTANTLY FAILS TO CITE ANY PRIMARY SOURCES RELYING ENTIRELY ON SECONDARY LITERATURE SO I TAKE A LOT OF WORK ON AZTEC PHILOSOPHY CAREFULLY ALTHOUGH THIS ARTICLE IN THE OP ACTUALLY SEEMS PRETTY GOOD I WOULD ADD THAT I DON'T THINK THEIR PHILOSOPHY IS HOPEFUL OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT IT REALLY IS QUITE BLEAK AND THEIR POETRY IS CONSTANTLY FILLED WITH INTERJECTIONS OF GRIEF IYOYAHUE ANY REVELRY MENTIONED ISN'T HEDONISTIC NOR EXISTENTIALIST LIKE SISYPHUS IT'S DONE IN AN UNKNOWING AND BEWILDERED STATE OF MIND
DELETED
THAT IS BRILLIANT I I HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE AND I'VE TRAVELED TOURS AND VACATION THRU MOST OF MEXICO TIL
THIS IS FASCINATING AND I THINK ALIGNS MUCH MORE CLOSELY TO MY OWN EXPERIENCE THAN MORE TRADITIONAL WESTERN PHILOSOPHY IT DOES BEAR MORE RESEMBLANCE TO EASTERN THOUGHT THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED AS WELL

I'M VERY MUCH INTERESTED INTO DIGGING FURTHER INTO BOTH THE PHILOSOPHY AND THE HISTORY OF THOUGHT IN AZTEC SOCIETY ANY RECOMMENDATIONS
AZTEC PHILOSOPHY IS LIKE HERACLITUS ETERNAL FLUX MIXED WITH THE VEDIC IDEAS OF SAMSARA AND THE MIDDLEWAY A COPING STRATEGY TO AS THE AZTECS CALLED IT
NOT SURE IF ANYONE ALREADY ANSWERED THIS BUT THE POOL AUH Y A GREAT START FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT PRE-HISPANIC CULTURE PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION
SOME INTERESTING THINGS TO NOTE

THE AZTEC OR MEXICA AS THEY CALLED THEMSELVES HAD AN IDEOGRAPHIC LANGUAGE MOST OF THEIR CODICES WERE BURNED

THE AUTHOR IS TECHNICALLY USING NAHUA CODICES NAHUA IS A TERM APPLIED TO THE AZTEC SINCE THE CULTURES WERE SO DIFFERENT

THE AUTHOR MENTIONS CODICES WRITTEN BY PRIESTS THIS ISN'T STRICTLY TRUE NAHUA SCRIBES AND ARTISTS WERE TRAINED BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND THESE ARE USUALLY THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE BOOKS THAT WE HAVE THEY RECORDED HISTORY GEOGRAPHY TRADITIONS AND EVEN ANTHROPOLOGY

THESE NAHUA CODICES USUALLY CONTAINED A ROMANIZED NAHUATL TRANSLATION THOUGH THIS WASN'T ALWAYS PRESENT SPANISH AND WHAT THE SPANISH INTERPRETED TO BE ILLUSTRATIONS LIKE I SAID BEFORE THOUGH THE NAHUA WRITTEN LANGUAGE IS ACTUALLY IDEOGRAPHIC PICTOGRAPHIC SO THESE ARE ACTUALLY ANOTHER TRANSLATION OF THE TEXT DIANA KEPPEL HAS EVEN POINTED OUT THAT THESE PICTURES CONTAINED NUANCES THAT ARE UNAVAILABLE THROUGH READING THE TEXT NAMELY THAT THE SOURCE OF THE PIGMENTS USED OFTEN ADDED EXTRA MEANING WHAT WAS WRITTEN

SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO CITE ONE OF THESE MANUSCRIPTS IT'S A HUGE TASK TO UNDERTAKE AND FOR SOMETHING THAT ISN'T TARGETED AT A VERY SPECIFIC AUDIENCE KIND OF UNNECESSARY

EDIT CORRECTING AUTOCORRECT
I AM NOT WELL-VERSED IN AZTEC PHILOSOPHY NOR I AM I WELL-VERSED IN EASTERN PHILOSOPHY BUT FROM THIS BRIEF OVERVIEW THE AZTEC NOTION OF NELTILIZTLI REMINDS ME OF THE TAOIST CONCEPT OF WU-WEI IN THAT BOTH OF THESE OFFER MEANS OF LIVING THAT EMPHASIZE HARMONY WITH AND NOT AUTHORITY OVER ONE'S CIRCUMSTANCE FURTHERMORE CHARACTERIZATION OF AZTEC THEOLOGY AS PANTHEISTIC ALSO REMINDS ME OF TAOISM

INTERESTING PARALLELS
REMOVED
REMOVED
FREAKING AWESOME NEVER BEEN INTRODUCED TO AZTEC PHILOSOPHY GOING TO LOOK INTO IT MORE HAD TO LAUGH AT THE END THOUGH BECAUSE I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK WORK SHALL SET YOU FREE
I HAVEN'T STADIE PHILOSOPHY MYSELF OVERDOSED ON MY FATHER'S LECTURES AS A CHILD BUT THIS REMINDS ME OF THE NAVAJO VIEW OF LIFE SUCH AS IT IS PRESENTED IN CRIME STORIES NOTE REMINDED ME OF NOT SEEMS THE SAME
WOW THAT WAS WONDERFUL TO READ THANKS FOR SHARING THAT
IF YOU ARE INTEREST THERE THIS TOME NAMED THOUGHT AND RELIGION IN ANCIENT MEXICO DE NADA

DETAILS PENSAMIENTOYRELI


THEY WERE LIKE THE MANDALORIAN ONLY CONFLICT MADE THE FLOWERS BLOSSOM

AKA THE THE FLOWERS REPRESENTED SOULS
AND THAT IS THE EXACT REASON WHY HAPPINESS IN RUSSIAN HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING WHICH HAS A LOT LESS TO DO WITH PLEASURE
AS A PESSIMIST AZTEC PHILOSOPHY PROVIDES YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A DECLINING CIVILIZATION SEEKING SOLUTIONS TO THE UNSOLVABLE FROM THE UNCARING UNIVERSE

TIL SLICK WAS A COMMON NAME AMONG AZTECS
THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT IS REACHED IN BHAGAVAT CITA WE ARE NOT THE SUPREME ENJOYER THE LORD IS
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE AZTECS DID IN FACT BELIEVE ALL OF THIS IT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT PHILOSOPHY TO LIVE BY IT'S ABOUT THE JOURNEY AND NOT THE DESTINATION BECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT LIFE IS
REMOVED
THE ILLUSION OF PURPOSE

OR ACCEPTING DUALITY


EDIT THIS WAS JUST POSTED ON R MEDITATION AND IT KINDA FITS
WHEN DISCUSSING HAPPINESS AND THE GOOD LIFE WHAT WAS THE ROLE OF RIPPING THE BEATING HEARTS OUT OF THOUSANDS OF LIVING BREATHING HUMAN BEINGS PER DAY

WHAT ABOUT WHEN THEY MADE CHILDREN CRY ON THE WAY TO BEING THROWN ALIVE INTO BONFIRES CERTAINLY THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPY IF THE RAIN ON THEIR CROPS STOPPED
REMOVED
REMOVED
BLDR SACRIFICE YOUR FAMILY TO THE SUN GOD HAPPINESS
MEXICAN PHILOSOPHERS LOL OK
READING THE ARTICLE I REALIZED I WAS INTERESTED ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE A CULTURE FROM THE PAST AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD REASON TO BE INTERESTED IN THEIR PHILOSOPHY THE FACT THEY'RE NO LONGER AROUND IS EVIDENCE THEIR PHILOSOPHY WASN'T USEFUL IN PERPETUATING THEIR CULTURE A PHILOSOPHY INCLUDING CHILD SACRIFICE IS EVIDENTIALLY A SELF-DESTRUCTIVE ONE MORE GENERALLY IF WE'RE NOT STILL TALKING ABOUT AZTEC PHILOSOPHY TODAY PERHAPS THERE'S A GOOD REASON

SO I WAS FACED WITH THE QUESTION WHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT AZTEC PHILOSOPHY THIS QUESTION WASN'T ANSWERED BY THIS ARTICLE
REMOVED
I FELT THIS VIDEO RAISED MORE QUESTIONS THEN IT ANSWERED IT ALSO ENDED ON A NOTE THAT WAS NOT COHESIVE WITH THE CONTEXT OF THE START OF THE VIDEO
SO WHY SHOULD WE VOTE WHEN ONE VOTE IS UNLIKELY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE MAYBE I SPACED OUT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WAS ANSWERED USUALLY PEOPLE JUST SAY WELL IMAGINE IF EVERYONE THOUGHT LIKE THAT THEN NOBODY WOULD VOTE BUT THAT ANSWER HAS ALWAYS SEEMED UNSATISFACTORY TO ME
RELATED
WELL I'VE BEEN YELLED AT AND BELITTLED BY FRIENDS AND EVEN FAMILY ABOUT CHOOSING A 3RD PARTY CANDIDATE I'VE ALWAYS VOTED 3RD PARTY NEVER SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM UNTIL THIS ELECTION I DON'T THINK I WASTED MY VOTE MY STATE IS A GIVEN RED STATE EVERY ELECTION BY A LANDSLIDE SO EVEN WANTING TO VOTE BLUE WOULDN'T OF MATTERED IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS RIGHT
THAT DIDN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING WTF WAS THAT

ILLUSTRATIONS WERE COOL THO
SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO PROFESSOR JONATHAN ANOMALY DUKE AND UNC CHAPEL HILL DISCUSSES PUBLIC GOODS WHICH ARE GOODS THAT ARE JOINTLY CONSUMED SO THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE PUBLIC GOODS OFTEN LEAD TO UNEXPLOITED GAINS FROM TRADE AND ARE FREQUENTLY INVOKED TO JUSTIFY WHY WE HAVE A STATE TO PERFORM BASIC FUNCTIONS LIKE DEFENSE PROPERTY ADJUDICATION AND THE REGULATION OF POLLUTION

THE REASON YOU SHOULD VOTE WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOUR VOTE WON'T AFFECT THE OUTCOME IS BECAUSE IT IS STILL PRESERVED FOR LATER ANALYSIS POLITICIANS DIATOMINE VOTES TO CREATE A PICTURE OF THE PREFERENCES AND DISPOSITIONS PRESENT AMONG THE ELECTORATE BY DEMOGRAPHIC THEY THEN THEORETICALLY USE THAT DATA TO INFORM POLICY AND LAW BUT CERTAINLY USE IT TO INFORM CAMPAIGNS WHICH IN THEORY INFORMS POLICY AND LAW

IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT THE OUTCOME IT'S ABOUT SPEAKING YOUR VOTE ISN'T ONLY A DECISION NUDGE IT'S ALSO YOUR VOICE

WE'VE BEEN TOLD IN THE PAST THAT IF WE DON'T VOTE WE SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE OUTCOME THAT'S INCORRECT IF YOU DIDN'T VOTE IN SOME RECENT ELECTION THEN YOU ALREADY HAVEN'T COMPLAINED ABOUT THE OUTCOME
VOTING DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AS AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION BUT AS A GROUP ACTION WHEN YOU ARE VOTING YOU ONLY CONTRIBUTE YOUR SOLITARY VOTE BUT YOU ARE DOING SO ALONGSIDE MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE VOTING WITH THE SAME OR SIMILAR POLICY PREFERENCES AS YOU THEREFORE IF YOU DO NOT VOTE YOU ARE LIMITING THE IMPACT THAT YOUR GROUP OF LIKE-MINDED VOTERS CAN HAVE THAT'S WHY SO MANY MODERN VOTING SYSTEMS FOCUS ON PROVIDING PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION SO THAT EVERY SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL GROUP IS REPRESENTED IN THE GOVERNMENT PROPORTIONALLY TO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTING POPULATION THEY MAKE UP THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS EMPHASIZE THE GROUP ASPECT OF VOTING MUCH BETTER THAN FIRST PAST THE POST ELECTION IS PROBABLY WHY I MOSTLY HEAR THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RATIONALITY OF VOTING IN COUNTRIES LIKE THE US OR THE UK WHO HAVE FPP
YOU DO HAVE CONTROL OVER SUPPLY AND DEMAND FRIENDS REMEMBER THIS BUYING OR ADVERTISING IS YER DIRECT VOTE
I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THEIR VOTES DON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE NO YOUR SINGLE VOTE DOESN'T MATTER IT SHOULDN'T MATTER THAT'S NOT WHAT DEMOCRACY IS DEMOCRACY IS JUST RULE OF THE MAJORITY I DON'T MEAN TO COME ACROSS AS CONDESCENDING BUT DO PEOPLE REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS

YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN DEMOCRACY OR NOT IT'S A CHOICE YOU HAVE NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS
A BETTER QUESTION WOULD BE WHY SHOULD WE VOTE AT ALL WHEN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE DECIDES WHO IS PRESIDENT BEFORE MORE THAN OF THE VOTES ARE EVEN COUNTED
THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF THE STUPID ELECTORAL COLLEGE DIDN'T EXIST EVERYONE'S VOTE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A MUCH MORE WEIGHING EFFECT ON ELECTIONS THIS IN RETURN WOULD MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY VOTE
ONE VOTE DOESN'T MATTER FALSE HTTPS
THIS IS GREAT IT SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF THING WHICH MIGHT TURN PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ALREADY INTO PHILOSOPHY LOGIC GAME THEORY ONTO THOSE THINGS AND THAT'S RARE INDEED
HOW ARE THESE VIDEOS MADE WHAT SOFTWARE IS USED TO DO THE BITS OF WRITING OR DRAWING IN SUCH VIDEOS
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE ARGUMENT OF NOT VOTING BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T COUNT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT ARGUMENT IS ENTIRELY BASED ON THE PREMISE OF THE OPPOSITION YOU NEED PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THIS ARGUMENT TO MAKE SENSE
I REALLY LIKE THIS CHANNEL AND SUBSCRIBED THANKS FOR SHARING
WHEN ALL FACTORS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT INCLUDING GAME THEORETIC NOTIONS LIKE RATIONAL CHOICE THEORY SUPERNATIONALISM I FEEL THAT MY TIME CAN BE BETTER SPENT ELSEWHERE EVEN ON REDDIN WHICH SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW LITTLE I THINK OF VOTING I GUESS

AND I DON'T SEE WHY IS BAD EITHER BECAUSE OF THE TWO GROUPS

EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY

EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY WHO WILL VOLUNTARILY MAKE A SMALL PERSONAL SACRIFICE TO VOTE

I'D SAY THE LATTER IS SLIGHTLY MORE LIKELY TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES
NOBODY EVER GOES THERE ANYMORE IT'S TOO CROWDED WE SHOULD CALL THIS THE YOGI BERRA PARADOX
THE PUBLIC OR THE PEOPLE DO NOT EXIST AS ENTITIES ONLY INDIVIDUALS HAVE RIGHTS SAKES DUTIES ETC
I FEEL LIKE IF YOU FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT A CANDIDATE VOTE IF NOT DON'T SIMPLE IT MATTERS IF YOU CARE IF NOT DON'T
HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A LECTURER WHEN I ASKED WHAT'S THE POINT IN VOTING IF MY VOTE WON'T MAKE A SINGLE DIFFERENCE

HIS REPLY THE CONCEPT OF A SINGLE VOTE NOT COUNTING MAY DISCOURAGE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME IDEA THEREFOR YOU HAVE TO IGNORE THIS IDEA THAT VOTE DOESN'T COUNT SO THAT ALL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE THIS IDEA'S WILL VOTE INSTEAD AND THEN IT WILL HAVE A DIFFERENCE

SO THE IDEA IS THAT IF AS MANY PEOPLE IGNORE THE FACT THAT ONE VOTE DOESNT MATTER THEN SUDDENLY EVERYONE'S DOES
CAN SOMEONE GIVE ME A TL DW

SO DOES ALTRUISTIC PUNISHMENT INCLUDE GIVING MY FAMILY THAT SUPPORTED TRUMP DONATIONS IN THEIR NAME TO THE NAACP AND ACLU FOR CHRISTMAS
REALLY ENJOYED IT DEEP INSIGHT AND VERY CONCISE WELL DONE
WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A VOTE HAVING NO IMPACT THEY USUALLY SEEM TO MEAN THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE ALTERED THE WINNER OF THIS ELECTION

BUT I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT'S THE ONLY IMPACT PEOPLE CONSIDER ELECTION DEMOGRAPHICS MATTER NOT JUST OUTCOMES

IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR OFFICE IN A DISTRICT THAT IS REPUBLICAN THE POSITIONS YOU WOULD TAKE ARE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU WOULD TAKE IN A REPUBLICAN IN A PLACE THAT IS REPUBLICAN YOU MIGHT NOT RUN AT ALL YET ALL OF THOSE ARE SUPPOSEDLY THE SAME FOR MOST ANALYSTS OF THIS ISSUE
REMOVED
A SINGLE VOTE ALONE MAKES NOT DIFFERENCE BUT WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE VOTE OR DON'T IT HAS AN IMPACT
THE TRADITIONAL IDEA THAT YOUR VOTE DOESN'T MATTER MIGHT BE WRONG THE IDEA IS THAT THE EXPECTED VALUE OF ACTIONS IS ALL THAT MATTERS AND THE EXPECTED VALUE OF A VOTE IS BASICALLY ZERO SINCE THE CHANCE OF YOU BEING A TIE BREAKING VOTE IS ASTRONOMICALLY SMALL

RESEARCHERS CALCULATE THAT THE PROBABILITY OF YOUR VOTE BEING A TIE BREAKER IN THE US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS SOMETHING LIKE IN MILLION SWING STATE VOTERS TO IN MILLION AVERAGE VOTER IF YOU BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT IS WORTH A TRILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE COST OF OBAMACARE AND A THIRD OF THE COST OF THE IRAQ WAR THEN YOUR VOTE IS WORTH TO AT LEAST THAT'S THE EXPECTED VALUE CALCULATION

IN MORE LOCAL ELECTIONS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THE TABLE IS MUCH SMALLER BUT THE PROBABILITY OF YOU BEING A TIE BREAKER SHOULD BE EVEN HIGHER GIVEN THE FEWER VOTERS IT'S HARD TO ESTIMATE IF THESE VALUES EXACTLY WORK OUT BUT I STILL THINK THE EV OF VOTING IS PROBABLY POSITIVE IN LOCAL ELECTIONS

THAT'S JUST WITH DOLLAR AMOUNTS I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT CAN DO MORE GOOD THAN JUST SAVING MONEY HOW DO YOU CALCULATE THE VALUE OF THE LIVES KILLED IN A WAR OR SAVED FROM BETTER HEALTHCARE POLICY

EVEN IF MY ESTIMATE FOR THE VALUE OF THE PRESIDENT OR THE PROBABILITY OF BEING A TIE BREAKER IS OFF BY 2 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE IT'S STILL WORTH THE TIME TO JUST GO VOTE

THE ARE OTHER ARGUMENTS FOR VOTING I THINK LIKE IMAGINE AROUND THE COUNTRY THERE ARE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT THINK EXACTLY THE WAY YOU DO LET'S SAY IN AN EXTREME CASE THEY ARE EXACT CLONES OF YOU IF YOU DECIDE TO VOTE YOUR CLONES BEING EXACTLY THE SAME AS YOU WILL MAKE EXACTLY THE SAME DECISION SO YOUR CHOICE OF NOT VOTING ACTUALLY DETERMINES THE VOTES OF ALL YOUR CLONES AS WELL SO YOU SHOULD FACTOR IN HOW MANY VOTES THEY HAVE
CRAPPY VIDEO

YOU NEED TO VOTE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T RELY ON EVERYONE ELSE TO VOTE FOR YOUR CANDIDATE OR ISSUE IF YOU DO RISK EVERYONE ELSE THINKING THE SAME WAY AS YOU AND NOT VOTING BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE WILLIAM

THEN YOU LOSE
YOU SHOULD VOTE BECAUSE OF THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE YOU CAN UNIVERSALIZE VOTING BUT YOU CAN'T UNIVERSALIZE
MOB RULE IS IMMORAL
IS IT REALLY THAT DIFFICULT TO TAKE MINS OUT OF YOUR DAY

IF YOU HONESTLY CAN'T MUSTER THE EFFORT TO GET OUT TO THE POLL SPOT THEN NOTHING IS GOING TO CONVINCE YOU
IS THIS BASICALLY DONE FOR AMERICAN VOTERS SINCE THEIR SYSTEM WITH THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND EVERYTHING DIFFERS FROM MOST AROUND THE WORLD
THAT VIDEO WAS GARBAGE DIDN'T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IT RAISED A BUNCH OF NEW ONES IT HAD NO COHESION AND IT ENDED IN SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT STARTED ON
NOT SPECIFIC TO THIS ELECTION IN PARTICULAR BUT I LOVE WATCHING THE MENTAL GYMNASTICS THAT PEOPLE TRY TO GO THROUGH WHEN THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT LOSING AN ELECTION DUE TO LOW VOTER TURNOUT AND THEN BLAME IT ON PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR A 3RD PARTY IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF THE MILLIONS OF LAZY ARSES WHO STAYED HOME IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF THE THEIR SIDE HAVING A BAD CANDIDATE OR THEIR OPPONENT HAVING A GOOD CANDIDATE IT'S SUDDENLY SOME IMMENSE ALGEBRAIC EQUATION ON HOW YOU WASTED YOUR VOTE

WHAT IF I HAD VOTED FOR ONE OF THE 2 MAJOR CANDIDATES JUST NOT THE ONE YOU WANTED ME TO WOULD YOU HAVE WANTED ME TO STICK TO ONLY TO THOSE 2 PARTIES STILL AND MAKE IT EVEN IF ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT FOR YOUR CHOICE TO WIN VOTING FOR A 3RD PARTY EVEN OUT OF PROTEST IS YOUR RIGHT AND IN A SYSTEM WHERE THE CANDIDATES ARE INCREASINGLY IN IT FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL GAIN AND DON'T LISTEN TO A DAMN WORD YOU SAY UNLESS YOU PERSONALLY ARE DONATING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THEM HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPECT FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THE OPINION THAT THEY WANT BETTER CHOICES IN THE FUTURE
AGREED THEN
FOR MARX PROGRESS IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH HIS ACCOUNT OF HISTORICAL MATERIALISM HISTORICAL MATERIALISM PLACES CHANGES IN ECONOMIC SYSTEM AS THE BASIS FOR CHANGES IN THE SUPERSTRUCTURE OF SOCIETY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC SYSTEM ARE DETERMINED BY TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS

THIS IS INCORRECT FOR MARX IT IS THE RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION THAT DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM HENCE HISTORY IS THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN LORDS AND SERFS PROLETARIAT AND BOURGEOISIE ETC TECHNOLOGY IS GENERALLY IRRELEVANT TO POLITICAL ECONOMY EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THE TECHNOLOGY IS REVOLUTIONIZED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF RELATIVE SURPLUS VALUE
MARX IS A METAPHYSICAL UTILITARIAN IF I DARE SAY MARX AND MANY FORMS OF MARXISM AFTERWARDS SAW IN HISTORY AN EVENTUAL CRESCENDO OF PROGRESS LEADING TOWARDS THE UNIVERSAL HAPPINESS OF COMMUNISM WHILE IN PURE POLITICS MARX MAY DIVERGE FROM LIBERALISM BECAUSE HE SEES HISTORICAL CLASSES AS ACTORS WHO HAVE GIVEN PREROGATIVES TO BENEFIT A PARTICULAR SOCIAL ORGANIZATION RATHER THAN SIMPLY THE NEEDS OF A COMMON MAJORITY YET AT THE SAME TIME WITH MARX THE PROLETARIAT IS A CLASS THAT MAXIMIZES THE UTILITY OF ECONOMY SO THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL MAY BE A PURE WORKER
IS A TRANSCRIPT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO WATCH A VIDEO
JUST READ THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE ON BIOSEMIOTICS
IT BASICALLY ASSUMES THE TRUTH OF HALLUCINATORY EXPERIENCES AND DENIES THE TRUTH OF VERIDICAL EXPERIENCES WITHOUT ARGUMENT

I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO CALL AN EXPERIENCE TRUE I CAN ONLY HEAR THAT AS MEANING THE SAME THING AS VERIDICAL BUT THAT CAN'T BE WHAT YOU'RE GOING FOR SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY THE ARGUMENT FROM HALLUCINATION ASSUMES THAT HALLUCINATORY EXPERIENCES AND NOT VERIDICAL EXPERIENCES ARE TRUE

MAYBE ON A SIMILAR NOTE HOW COULD THIS CONCLUSION POSSIBLY BE TRUE

C THEREFORE ONE IS PERCEPTUALLY AWARE OF ORDINARY OBJECTS IN HALLUCINATORY EXPERIENCES

IF HAVING SOME EXPERIENCE RENDERS ONE AWARE OF AN ORDINARY OBJECT THEN THAT EXPERIENCE ISN'T A HALLUCINATION RIGHT LIKE IF I HAVE AN EXPERIENCE AS OF A POOL OF WATER AND THERE REALLY IS A POOL OF WATER THAT I'M MADE AWARE OF IN HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE ISN'T THAT EXPERIENCE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY VERIDICAL AND NOT HALLUCINATORY SO I DON'T SEE HOW THE PREMISES OF YOUR ARGUMENT FROM VERIDICAL EXPERIENCE ARE PLAUSIBLE IF THEY ENTAIL THIS CONCLUSION AND SIMILARLY IF YOUR UNINTERESTING ARGUMENT ENTAILS THIS CONCLUSION

C THEREFORE ONE IS EITHER PERCEPTUALLY AWARE OF ORDINARY OBJECTS IN HALLUCINATORY EXPERIENCES OR ONE IS NOT PERCEPTUALLY AWARE OF ORDINARY OBJECTS IN VERIDICAL EXPERIENCE

THEN IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE TO REJECT THE FIRST DISJUNCT OF THIS CONCLUSION AND SO ACCEPT THE SECOND DISJUNCT WHICH IS JUST THE CONCLUSION OF THE ARGUMENT FROM HALLUCINATION
NOW WE'RE ALL CORRUPT COPS
ACTUALLY THERE IS SOMETHING TO THIS READ JANE JACOBS DEATH OF GREAT AMERICAN CITIES OR SIMPLE VISIT CITIES IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE WORLD

HER THESES IS BECAUSE WE TRY TO ELIMINATE FOOT TRAFFIC AND LOITERING AND STREET LIFE IN OUR CITIES WE'VE EFFECTIVELY REMOVE THE ONE THING THAT PREVENTS CRIME HAVING LOTS OF NEIGHBORS ON THE STREET JUST LIVING WHO ACT AS A DETERRENT IT'S EMPTY STREETS THAT MAKE CRIME EASY BECAUSE THERE'S NO ONE TO WITNESS OR CHALLENGE THE CRIME

THIS IS ALSO RELATED TO THE TENDENCIES TOWARD CAR CULTURE SUBURBS AND BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE IN THE US WHICH LOOK GOOD ON PAPER IN THE ABSTRACT BUT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK FOR PEOPLE IN THE CITY ALL OF THESE THINGS DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING TO ELIMINATE PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC THAT ELIMINATES THE PREVENTION OF CRIME

SO IN THIS SENSE EVERYONE BECOMES A COP WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT JUST BY BEING PART OF A COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD

THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR AMERICAN CITES TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS TRADITIONAL DESIGNS OF EMPHASIZING CARS BRUTALIST ARCHITECTURE STREETS SEPARATED ZONING VS MIXED USE LACK OF MASS TRANSIT ETC
SO ANARCHISM
IN THEORY THEY COULD IMPLEMENT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO MANDATORY X AMOUNT OF YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE TRAIN AND FORCE THE POPULACE TO BE PART OF A POLICE FORCE FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF YEARS IT WOULD CHANGE THE WAY THE COUNTRY SAW LAW ENFORCEMENT
I COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE CORRUPTION WOULD CONTINUE TO EXIST ON A MUCH MORE PETTY LEVEL BE FINING AND ARRESTING EACH OTHER OVER BULL SHIT LEFT AND RIGHT OVER PERSONAL EMOTIONAL REACTIONS AND

PERSONALLY WITH ALL THAT I'VE BEEN READING ONLINE ON FACEBOOK AND HAVE SEEN ON TELEVISION RECENTLY I WOULDN'T TRUST A SINGLE AMERICAN CITIZEN TO EVEN SIT NEXT TO ME ON A BUS RIGHT NOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE BLIND FOOLISH EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE AND JUST DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS

THIS ELECTION ESPECIALLY HAS FUELED SOME OF THE DARKEST PARTS OF PEOPLE'S MIND IT STARTED WITH MEDIA COVERAGE SLANDER AND TWISTS ON STORIES THAT TURNED INTO POLITICAL PROPAGANDA TO SWAY VOTES AND IT'S ENDED WITH PEOPLE GENUINELY TAKING THE NEWS AT FACE VALUE AND THREATENING OTHER PEOPLE'S VERY WAY OF LIFE ON A REGULAR BASIS

TRUMP ISN'T A FUCKED UP PRESIDENT AMERICANS ARE FUCKED UP PEOPLE I REALLY HOPE THAT HE AND HILLARY BOTH ARE VERY CAREFUL FOR A WHILE BECAUSE I'M LEGITIMATELY WORRIED ABOUT EVEN MY OWN SAFETY OUT THERE

FUCK THIS THEORY NOOOOOO WAY
HOW TO CURE CORRUPTION MAKE EVERY PERSON A COP

HOW TO CURE DISEASE MAKE EVERY PERSON A DOCTOR

HOW TO CURE HUNGER MAKE EVERY PERSON A FARMER

I LIKE THIS WAY OF THINKING IT IS COMPLETELY DEVOID OF ANY TYPE OF WISDOM OR NUANCE
I HAD HOPED FOR SOME PROPER THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS ON HOW IT COULD BE USED IN THE REAL WORLD

ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEAS

REMOVED
BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY

A GAME THEORY
PEOPLE CANNOT SELF GOVERN REDDIN IS THE SHINING EXAMPLE OF THAT RATHER THAN INTELLIGENT DISCOURSE PEOPLE WILL OFTEN GRAVITATE TOWARDS CREATING THEIR OWN LITTLE BUBBLES PEOPLE WILL USE THEIR POWER TO SUBSTITUTE TRUTH WITH THEIR OWN REALITY YOU WOULD CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE SHEER NUMBERS WOULD DICTATE NARRATIVE

FOR INSTANCE IF ONE PERSON WERE TO PURGE THE CORRUPTION OF THIS WORLD IN ONE WITHOUT FIRST PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF CORRUPTION PEOPLE WOULD BE OUTRAGED PEOPLE WOULD REJECT THIS PERSON PEOPLE WOULD SEE THIS PERSON AS THE ENEMY IF YOU WERE TO SAY THAT THEN ONE MUST FIRST PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF CORRUPTION THEN WE ARE ALREADY COPS AND THIS DISCUSSION IS POINTLESS

MODERN SOCIETY IS SIMPLY TOO QUICK TO REACT TO EASY TO MANIPULATE AND MUCH PREFERS TO BE SPOOFED RATHER THAN ASCERTAIN ANYTHING FOR THEMSELVES

GIVING A GUN TO A CHILD IS ALWAYS A BAD IDEA
SO WHAT WOULD INEVITABLY BE A TOTALITARIAN NIGHTMARE STATE NO THANKS
IF EVERYONE IS A COP THEN NOONE IS
I WOULD WONDER IF YOU COULD RUN A GAME IN WHICH THE REPORTER OF A CORRUPTION IS AWARDED THE THEORETICAL SPOILS OF A CORRUPTION I EAST THE INFORMER GETS ALL THE SPOILS CORRUPTION WOULD ONLY BENEFIT THE INDIVIDUAL AND WOULD DISINCENTIVIZE CORRUPTION THAT REQUIRES COLLUSION CONSPIRACY OR PUBLIC ACQUIESCENCE I UNDERSTAND SOME LEAK PROGRAMS WILL OFFER A REWARD BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OFFER A AWARD OF THE ILL GOTTEN GAINS PEOPLE WOULD BE MUCH LESS INCLINED TO SEEK ILL GOTTEN REWARDS IF THEY CAN BE EASILY TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER AS WELL AS THEM RECEIVING THE PUNISHMENT NOTICEABLE FLAWS
THAT ARTICLE WAS SEXY AS FUCK LOVE READING STUFF BY PEOPLE WHO OPERATE FROM DATA BUT CAN STILL TAKE THAT AND RUN WITH IT LATERALLY

DON'T HAVE MUCH ELSE TO CONTRIBUTE SR
THATS BASICALLY WHAT THEY DID IN THE DDR DID NOT GO WELL
EVERYONE BEING A COP WORKED WELL IN EAST GERMANY YOU WERE AFRAID TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINION AND FEELINGS OUT OF FEAR THAT EVEN YOUR FRIEND WOULD TURN YOU IN
I READ CONSUMPTION INSTEAD OF CORRUPTION AND SPENT A COUPLE HOURS RESEARCHING THE HISTORY OF POLICE AND TUBERCULOSIS MY CONCLUSION BEING A COP WON'T ALWAYS SAVE YOU

EDIT WURTZ EN STOUGH
REMOVED
THE WORKERS UNABLE TO PASS ON THEIR PRIVATE GENOME DEVOTE THEMSELVES INSTEAD TO THE SERVICE OF THE NEST

THE AUTHOR DOESNT UNDERSTAND BEES AND ANTS THE WORKERS ARE ALL FEMALES AND SHARE THEIR GENETICS WITH THE QUEEN SO IN SERVING THE NEST THEY ARE PASSING ON THEIR OWN GENES

BUT THAT S NOT QUITE RIGHT EVEN IN THESE SUPERHUMANLY LAWFUL COMMUNITIES CRIME LURKS IN VIRTUALLY ALL THE SUBSOCIAL INSECTS A FEW WORKERS SURREPTITIOUSLY LAY EGGS OF THEIR OWN EGGS THAT CAN GROW INTO REPRODUCTIVE MALES BY DIVERTING SHARED RESOURCES AWAY FROM THE NEST THESE WORKERS SELFISHLY REDUCE THE FITNESS OF THEIR ESTIMATES THEY PLAY THE SYSTEM FOR THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE

THIS IS FALSE IN BEES FOR INSTANCE LAYING WORKERS ONLY HAPPEN IN CASES WHERE THE QUEEN DIES AND CANNOT LAY EGGS IF THE HIVE DOES NOT HAVE A YOUNG ENOUGH EGG TO TURN INTO A QUEEN THEN THE HIVE WILL DIE PERIOD SOME OF THE FEMALE WORKERS WILL THEN START LAYING EGGS WHICH WILL BE MALE DRONES SINCE THESE FEMALES ARE VIRGINS AND THEIR EGGS WILL BE UNFERTILIZED

THIS IS JUST A LAST CHANCE EFFORT TO PASS ON THE GENES OF THE HIVE WHEN IT HAS NO CHANCE TO SURVIVE ON ITS OWN

ORDINARY HONEYBEE WORKERS DETECT AND DEVOUR MORE THAN PER CENT OF THE EGGS LAID BY THEIR SISTERS

AGAIN THE AUTHOR DOESNT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE SEE MY EXPLANATION ABOVE OF LAYING WORKERS

BUT WHO NEEDS ILLEGAL CORRUPTION WHEN THE POLICE CAN LEGALLY PULL YOU OVER RANSACK YOUR CAR AND SELL ANYTHING THEY FIND

UMM WHAT
TECHNICALLY AMERICANS DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE THE LAW WHEN GOVERNMENT FAILS TO DO SO IT'S WHY WE HAVE A SECOND AMENDMENT THIS CONCEPT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE GAME THEORY ORIENTED RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE ARTICLE WHAT IS PROPOSED IS A KIND OF DEMOCRACY OF JUSTICE EVERY INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE THE LAW AT ALL TIMES BUT EVEN THE AUTHOR REALIZES HOW QUICKLY THAT WOULD SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL WITHOUT SOME KIND OF UNSPOKEN RULE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED

JAMES MADISON SAID HENCE IT IS THAT DEMOCRACIES HAVE EVER BEEN SPECTACLES OF TURBULENCE AND CONTENTION HAVE EVER BEEN FOUND INCOMPATIBLE WITH PERSONAL SECURITY OR THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY AND IN GENERAL HAVE BEEN AS SHORT IN THEIR LIVES AS THEY HAVE BEEN VIOLENT IN THEIR DEATHS

AMERICA SUCCEEDED BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZED THAT THE THERE IS GENIUS WAITING TO BE UNLEASHED IN ALL MEN THAT THE ABILITY TO RULE IS NOT A BIRTHRIGHT BUT ONE OF MANY TALENTS FOUND IN MEN OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE HOWEVER NOT ALL MEN ARE EQUALLY CAPABLE NOT ALL MEN ARE GOOD RULERS JUST AS THEY ARE NOT ALL GOOD SCIENTISTS OR FARMERS OUR FOUNDING FATHERS REALIZED THE FOLLY OF GIVING THE PEOPLE TOTAL POWER OVER GOVERNMENT AND LAW HOWEVER THEY ALSO UNDERSTOOD THE NEED TO REGULATE RULERS AND ENSURE THAT THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE REPRESENTED THAT IS WHY WE LIVE IN A REPRESENTATIVE REPUBLIC AND NOT A DEMOCRACY THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS NO DIFFERENT IMAGINE IF EVERY SW ON THE INTERNET COULD REPORT YOU FOR THEIR PERCEIVED HATE CRIMES IT'S JUST AS RIDICULOUS TO SUGGEST ANONYMOUS CRIME REPORTING AS IT IS TO SUGGEST ALLOWING CITIZENS TO HOLD MAJORITY VOTES TO DETERMINE SOMETHING LIKE FOREIGN POLICY

WE ALREADY HAVE TWO SYSTEMS FOR DEFEATING CORRUPTION ONE IS OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF GOVERNMENT POWER WHICH WE SAW ON FULL DISPLAY ON TUESDAY THE OTHER IS THE DUTY TO OVERTHROW CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS AND RE-ESTABLISH ORDER FOR WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED THE SECOND AMENDMENT
I LIKE THIS EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE EQUAL WHY IS A CERTAIN CLASS OF PEOPLE GRANTED EXTRA RIGHTS THIS IDEA NEEDS TO DISAPPEAR
CAN WE USE SOCIAL ENGINEERING TO MANIPULATE THIS SWITCH THE MODEL SUGGESTS THAT WE CAN IF WE DECREASE POWER INEQUALITIES INCREASE PUNISHMENTS AND REWARD PUNISHERS IN THEORY THAT SHOULD TRIGGER A SOCIETAL TRANSITION TO RIGHTEOUSNESS

CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN HOW REWARDING PUNISHERS TRANSITIONS TO RIGHTEOUSNESS
GREAT THOUGHTS MY MIND HOWEVER JUST KEEPS GOING BACK TO MOB MENTALITY AND LYNCH MOB STYLE SCENARIOS
I HAVE HEARD AN ARGUMENT THAT SOCIETIES VALUE HONOR CODES HIGHLY WHEN INSTITUTIONS AREN'T VIABLE ABSENT CORRUPT BASICALLY THE SAME IDEA
THIS IS HOW WE KEEP THE RULES IN GOLF WHEN A PLAYER COMMITS A RULES VIOLATION HE QUICKLY CALLS IT ON HIMSELF AND THE PENALTY IS ADDED TO THE SCORE AT THE END OF THE HOLE THIS HAS RESULTED IN PEOPLE LOSING GOLF TOURNAMENTS BUT THEY CAN WALK FREE KNOWING THEY DID THE RIGHT THING
HUMANS FUNCTION BEST IN COMMUNITIES OF ABOUT PEOPLE ANY LARGER AND YOU RUN INTO ALL OF THE PROBLEMS LISTEN ABOVE HUMANITY HAS GOTTEN TOO BIG FOR ITS BOOTS
AS A LIBERAL LEGALISE WEED AND ALL THAT BUT THE ENTIRE IDEA OF MAKING EVERYONE LOOK OVER EVERYONE'S SHOULDERS IS COMPLETELY FLAWED AND SEEMS NOTHING SHORT OF CAUSING MORE ISSUES

AUTHOR HIRED BY MARXIST SCUM
I'VE LONG SUPPORTED A NATIONAL SERVICE SYSTEM FOR POLICE SIMILAR TO A MILITARY DRAFT THE IMPORTANT POINT WOULD BE THAT THERE WOULD BE MANY PERHAPS HALF OF THE POLICE WHO WERE ONLY GOING TO DO THE JOB FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOT MAKE A CAREER OUT OF IT I THINK IT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS REPAIRING TRUST BETWEEN COPS ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY HAVE THE AUTHOR'S INTENDED EFFECT ON CORRUPTION AS WELL

THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THOSE AGAINST A MILITARY DRAFT OF COURSE
DON'T GIVE BLOOD THIRSTY POLITICAL WHITE KNIGHTS WEAPONS THEY MIGHT ABUSE THEM OR BE TOO SCARED OF THE IDEA OF USING THEM
POLICING ONLY WORKS WHEN THERE A FEW WITH GRANTED AUTHORITY WATCHING OVER A LARGER GROUP I'M GETTING FLASHES OF YOUTUBE HEROES
COOL NOW WE CAN ALL BREAK THE LAW AND GET AWAY WITH IT
SELF DETERMINISM IS ANARCHY MAN
I DON'T THINK SUZANNA SADEDIN HAS WATCHED ENOUGH SOVEREIGN CITIZEN VIDEOS
WORKED TO RID US OF ALL THOSE PESKY WITCHES A COUPLE HUNDRED YEARS AGO SOLID IDEA
SAN PEDRO PRISON IS AORTA LIKE THIS CERTAIN PRISONERS HAVE CLUBS AND ARE THE ONLY ENFORCERS ON THE INSIDE OF THE WALLS ON THE OUTSIDE THERE'S GUARDS WITH GUNS BUT OTHER THAN THAT THE PRISON IS RUN BY ITS INMATES
THERE IS A MUCH BETTER STRATEGY THAN MAKING EVERYONE SNITCHING ON EACH OTHER AND IMPLEMENTATION COSTS CLOSE TO NOTHING FREE BRIBERIES OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY 2 A CORRUPTION CONVICTION SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY LEAD TO A PROPERTY CONFISCATION AFTER A CONFISCATION THE INFORMER GETS A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF CONFISCATED PROPERTY

WE ARE ALL COPS ALREADY RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS READY TO HELP OUR BROTHERS OUT IF WE COULD JUST RID OUR RANKS OF FELLOW OFFICERS WHO ARE DO AFRAID THAT THEY SHOOT WHEN THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY DANGER THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE
MICHAEL A WOOD JR HAS BEEN PREACHING CIVILIAN LED POLICING FOR A WHILE NOW I WISH I COULD FIND ALL THE WRITINGS AND INFO BUT I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CHECKING HIM OUT
INTERESTING TO CONSIDER THIS ARTICLE ALONG WITH CHINA IMPLEMENTING ITS NEW MANDATORY SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS FOR ITS CITIZENS AND SCORING THEM WITH POINTS BASED ON CIVIC BEHAVIOR
SO THE PANOPTICON CONCEPT IS STILL ALIVE AND KICKING
IN OTHER WORDS EQUAL REPRESENTATION UNDER THE LAW


THIS SOUNDS LIKE A PARALLEL TO GUNS FOR EVERYONE POLICY
THANKS FOR WATCHING
THE PROBLEM WITH GOVERNANCE IS HUMANS

THE CURE IS ONE OF TWO THINGS IMPROVE THE HUMANS OR REMOVE THEM FROM GOVERNANCE
END RESULT WOULD BE ALONG THE LINES OF ALL COPS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME COPS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS
THE BIGGEST NO SHIT EVER IMO THIS IS BASICALLY THE FOUNDATION OF SOVEREIGN CITIZENSHIP IDEAS AND ARGUABLY OF ALL CIVILIZATION RECOGNIZING THE REAL MATERIAL VALUE OF ENLIGHTENMENT THE RECOGNITION OF OTHER PEOPLE

BUT HIERARCHY IS BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE

MAYBE FOR HUMANS GOOD THING WE'RE ONLY RIDING THEM EH

THE ARTICLE HAS A FAR MORE INTERESTING CAVEAT

AS A SPECIES WE APPEAR TO HAVE AN INSATIABLE APPETITE FOR ENFORCING ARBITRARY NORMS IMAGINE IF YOU WILL A SOCIETY WHERE THE LASER EYE OF SOCIAL CONDEMNATION IS TRAINED ON EVERY POSSIBLE TRANSGRESSION

WHICH IT GIVES A FEW SILLY EXAMPLES OF BEFORE DISMISSING WITH

ALREADY MOST OF US PARTICIPATE IN NUMEROUS DIFFERENT SOCIAL CONTEXTS SWITCHING ADEPTLY BETWEEN ROLES AND SOCIAL NORMS

BUT WHICH IS AGAIN BASED IN BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE NONSENSE

IF THE PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY CONSIDERING THEIR ACTIONS AND NOT JUST REGURGITATING A SET OF RULES PUNISHMENTS IT'S NOT ABOUT SWITCHING ROLES IT'S JUST A SINGLE CONSTANT OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR DEFINITIONS OF CORRECTNESS MAY VARY FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY FREQUENTLY WITHIN A SINGLE PERSON WHICH WOULD BE SYMPTOMATIC OF SOME DISSOCIATIVE DISORDER
BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY A GAME THEORY
OR PUT CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES EVERYWHERE AND AN ADMINISTRATIVE BODY THAT INTERPRETS EVERYTHING WE SAY AND DO
FASCINATING ARTICLE IF YOU THINK IN TERMS OF WIKILEAKS R AND S POL TODAY WE MAY BE SEEING THE RISE OF THE EGALITARIAN POLICE STATE AND A REDUCTION IN CORRUPTION I DON'T THINK TRUMP WOULD HAVE WON THE ELECTION WITHOUT THE INVESTIGATIVE WORK AND WEAPONIZED MEMES OF R AND POL WHICH FOCUSED ON FINDING EVIDENCE OF CORRUPTION IN WIKILEAKS RELEASES AND THEN MAKING IT EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE THESE UNPAID UNOFFICIAL INVESTIGATORS CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET MUCH HELP FROM THE CORRUPT MAINSTREAM MEDIA JAMES CAMEY LORETTA LYNCH OR THE GUY WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT ALL THE CORRUPTION EVERYWHERE AND CHOOSES TO SAY NOTHING JAMES CLAPPER

FLUSHED WITH SUCCESS R IS TURNING ITS SIGHTS ON SOMEONE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN HILLARY CLINTON NAMELY GEORGE SOROS AT THE SAME TIME WIKILEAKS HAS GAINED WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION AND RESPECTABILITY WHICH SHOULD ENCOURAGE MORE LEAKS PROVIDING MORE FUEL FOR THE CITIZENS TURNED INVESTIGATORS

THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS OR BELIEFS I AM SAYING THAT THE THESIS OF THIS ESSAY IS POSSIBLY ABOUT TO BECOME REALITY
WOW
LET'S START WITH ALL THINGS THAT STRIKE ME AS INCREDIBLY WRONG

FOR THAT TO WORK EVERYONE OF US WOULD HAVE TO LIVE IN A GLASSHOUSE AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE

2 AND THE ARTICLE GOES IN ON THAT IS THE FACT THAT THE DANGER OF LYNCH MOB MENTALITY IS FAAAS TO DAMN BIG AND IF YOU THINK SUCH THINGS WON'T HAPPEN BECAUSE HUMANITY AS A WHILE IS MORE TOLERANT AND ENLIGHTENED YOU WON'T HAVE TO LOOK FOR COUNTERARGUMENT FOR TOO LONG THE FANATICAL SIDE OF SW WILL BURN YOU AT STAKE FOR YOUR OPINION CLINTON SUPPORTERS WILL GLADLY CRUCIFY YOU IF YOU ARE TRUMP SUPPORTER AND VICE VERSA OFC AND I DIDN'T EVEN START TALKING ABOUT RELIGIOUS IDEAS IN THAT FLAT HIERARCHY YOU WILL HAVE YOUR BUBBLES OF PEOPLE WITH SAME IDEAS AND BELIEFS

FROM THE PRAGMATICAL SIDE ALONE LET'S ASSUME MAX B IS A FATHER WHO HAS TO WORK 2 JOBS TO KEEP HIS FAMILY AFLOAT AND WHEN HE IS DONE WITH HIS JOB TOOK SOME TIME FOR HIS KID HE HAS TO FIND SOME MOTIVATION AND STRENGTH TO PLAY THE POLICEMAN AS WELL BECAUSE FOR THAT SYSTEM TO WORK EVERYONE HAS TO BE A COP


GAME THEORY IS A CROCK OF SHIT
I THINK FOR A UNIFIED WORLD AS ONE SPECIES TO FUNCTION ACROSS VARIOUS DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS A SYSTEM LIKE THIS WOULD BE IDEAL IT WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE UTOPIA HOWEVER AS MOST FICTION AND HISTORY DEPICTS ULTIMATE ARE ALWAYS SHORT LIVED OR HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF FLAWS THAT MAKE YOU QUESTION IF IT REALLY IS A UTOPIA ANYMORE SUCH A MODEL OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE WOULD RELY HEAVILY UPON PEOPLE BEING NATURALLY GOOD NATURED WHICH SADLY IS NOT THE CASE IN A SOCIETY LIKE THIS YOU WOULD MORE THAN LIKELY HAVE OUTCASTS PEOPLE THAT WOULD NOT WANT TO CONFORM AND THEREFORE WOULD LEAVE TO SETUP THEIR OWN SOCIETY THUS LEADING TO DIVISION AND ANOTHER FACTION WITH ITS OWN CODES AND MORALS IN THEORY IT IS A WONDERFUL IDEA FOR WHERE SOCIETY COULD GO IN REALITY SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD INVITE DIVISION FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO CONFORM AND THOSE WHO WOULD DEFY THIS NEW SYSTEM

ABSTRACT

THIS PAPER COMPRISES THREE SECTIONS FIRST WE OFFER A TRADITIONAL DEFENCE OF DEONTOLOGY IN THE MANNER OF FOR EXAMPLE WEST D ROSS THE LEADING IDEA OF SUCH A DEFENCE IS THAT THE RIGHT IS INDEPENDENT OF THE GOOD SECOND WE MODIFY THE NOW STANDARD ACCOUNT OF THE DISTINCTION IN TERMS OF THE DIVIDE BETWEEN DEONTOLOGY AND CONSEQUENTIALISM THIS MODIFICATION IS NECESSARY IF INDIRECT CONSEQUENTIALISM IS TO COUNT AS A FORM OF CONSEQUENTIALISM THIRD WE CHALLENGE A DEFENCE OF DEONTOLOGY PROPOSED BY QUINN KAMM AND NAGEL

PROFESSOR MCNAUGHTON


PROFESSOR RAWLING
AROUND THE BOTTOM OF PAGE IS THE IDEA THE INTUITIONIST TAKE AT FACE VALUE THAT REASONS ARE SUFFICIENT

I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE THESIS THAT IT IS INTUITIVE THAT REASONS OUGHT TO HAVE MORAL WEIGHT

IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE WHEN SUPERMAN SAVES LOIS LANE OVER THE BUS FULL OF CHILDREN BUT I THINK THERE IS A STRONG INTUITION THAT THIS IS WRONG IN THE TROLLEY PROBLEM WHEN YOU SAVE YOUR MOTHER INSTEAD OF THE STRANGERS IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT THERE IS A STRONG INTUITION THAT THIS IS WRONG

AS HUMANS WE ARE MOTIVATED BY REASONS AS SUCH IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE WHEN WE ACT BASED ON THOSE MOTIVES HOWEVER THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT THESE ACTIONS ARE MORAL

SAVING YOUR BUDDY IS HONORABLE BUT SAVING A STRANGER IS HEROIC GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND OUR EVERYDAY ATTACHMENTS AND DOING GOOD FOR PERSONS WE DON'T KNOW AND MAY NEVER SEE AGAIN IS ALMOST ALWAYS SEEN AS INCREDIBLY HONORABLE HEROIC DECENT AND MORAL CHOOSING TO IGNORE THE STRANGER AND ONLY HELP OUR OWN IS USUALLY LOOKED DOWN UPON THOUGH TOLERATED

THERE IS A VERY BASIC INTUITION THAT WE OUGHT TO BE GOOD TO EVERYONE TREAT EVERYONE WELL AND BE WILLING TO STICK OUT OUR NECKS FOR EVERYONE THIS IS EQUALITY THIS IS FAIRNESS THIS IS JUSTICE ARGUABLY THIS IS BASIC HUMAN DECENCY ONCE YOU GRANT THAT IT IS MORALLY PERMISSIBLE TO PREFER FAMILY FRIENDS OVER STRANGERS YOU GET TYRANNY OLIGARCHY AND OPPRESSION
AMA

PROFESSOR PURYEAR WILL BE DOING AN AMA THIS UPCOMING MONDAY AT EST RELATED TO HIS WORK IN METAPHYSICS ETHICS AND HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY JOIN THE CONVERSATION HERE BY POSTING QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME AND JOIN US LIVE ON MONDAY AT NOON

ABSTRACT


FREGE SUPPOSEDLY THOUGHT THAT VAGUE PREDICATES HAVE NO REFERENT BEDEUTUNG BUT GIVEN OTHER THINGS HE EVIDENTLY BELIEVES SUCH A POSITION WOULD SEEM TO COMMIT HIM TO A SUSPECT NIHILISM ACCORDING TO WHICH ASSERTORIC SENTENCES CONTAINING VAGUE PREDICATES ARE NEITHER TRUE NOR FALSE I ARGUE THAT WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO RESIST ASCRIBING TO FREGE THE VIEW THAT VAGUE PREDICATES HAVE NO BEDEUTUNG AND THUS GOOD REASON TO RESIST SEEING HIM AS COMMITTED TO THE SUSPECT NIHILISM IN THE PROCESS I CALL ATTENTION TO SEVERAL TEXTS IN WHICH FREGE SUGGESTS THAT A VAGUE PREDICATE THOUGH LACKING A BEDEUTUNG OF ITS OWN CAN COME TO ACQUIRE A BEDEUTUNG IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS THE UPSHOT OF THIS SUGGESTION IS THAT VAGUE PREDICATES CAN SERVE THE PURPOSES OF ORDINARY COMMUNICATION QUITE WELL EVEN IF THEY ARE USELESS FOR LOGICAL PURPOSES

AUTHOR

STEPHEN PURYEAR ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AFFILIATE OF CLASSICAL STUDIES NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY
FROM THE CONCLUSION

IN SPITE OF ALL OUR EFFORTS IN ATTEMPTING TO RATIONALLY PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF GOD WE MUST AGREE THAT WE MAY FAIL TO CONVINCE EVEN A SINGLE OBSTINATE ATHEIST SHROUDING HIS ARGUMENTS WITH SCIENTIFIC OR PHILOSOPHICAL JARGON

BIT PRESUMPTUOUS ABOUT ATHEISTS I THINK
I FIND THE SUBJECT INTERESTING BUT THE AUTHOR WAS INSUFFERABLY CONDESCENDING
HI PROFESSOR PURYEAR THANK YOU FOR JOINING US I GOT A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU RELATED TO ANIMAL ETHICS

DO YOU BELIEVE ANIMALS CAN BE MORALLY WRONGED IF YES HOW SO AND RELATEDLY IS THE VIEW YOU DESCRIBE IN YOUR SCHOPENHAUER ON THE RIGHTS OF ANIMALS PRETTY MUCH YOUR OWN VIEW ON THE MATTER

2 DO YOU BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRIAL ANIMAL AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ARE MORALLY WRONG IF SO DO YOU ALSO TAKE IT TO BE MORALLY WRONG TO BUY THEIR PRODUCTS

ALL THE BEST



THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS DR

I'M AN UNDERGRAD PHILOSOPHY MAJOR AND I'VE RECENTLY BEGUN STUDYING COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY I'VE BEEN LOOKING FURTHER OUTSIDE OF THE WESTERN CANON OF PHILOSOPHY AND HAVE BEGUN STUDYING ASIAN PHILOSOPHIES CHINESE AND INDIAN SO FAR AND AM LOOKING FORWARD TO DELVING INTO OTHER TRADITIONS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT STUDYING WHAT IS OFTEN CONSIDERED RELIGION EX BUDDHISM OR FOLKLORE EX AFRICAN AS PHILOSOPHY
PROFESSOR PURYEAR I'M A SELF-TAUGHT PHILOSOPHER LOOKING FOR LITERATURE RELATED TO A POLITICAL THEORY I'M WORKING IN THE THEORY BEGINS WITH A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THAT PROVES THE MERE EXISTENCE OF HUMANITY IMPLIES THE EXISTENCE OF FIVE AND ONLY FIVE CONTEXTS OF ACTION FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A GIVEN SOCIETY PRIVATE ACTION PUBLIC ACTION POLITICAL ACTION FOREIGN ACTION AND FUTURE ACTION THIS IN TURN IMPLIES FIVE AND ONLY FIVE CONTEXTS OF CONCEPTS RELATED TO HUMAN ACTION GOALS INTENTION THE USE OF RESOURCE OWNERSHIP OF RESOURCES JUSTICE INJUSTICE METHODS FOR SOCIETY TO IMPOSE JUSTICE FREEDOM FROM INJUSTICE PRICE THE NEGOTIATION OF PRICE AND THE BENEFITS OF THE FREE NEGOTIATION OF PRICE OVER TIME THESE ARE ALL THE REQUIRED ELEMENTS TO EXTEND ADAM INVISIBLE HAND TO ALL CONTEXTS OF HUMAN ACTION IT IS ALSO ALL THAT IS NEEDED TO EXTEND ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE FREE NEGOTIATION OF PRICE TO ALL HUMAN ACTION QUESTION ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY LITERATURE IN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY ETHICS THAT APPROACHES THE SUBJECT IN THIS WAY
HI THANKS FOR THE AMA

I RECENTLY READ FINITISM AND THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSE AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE A POSITION ON PWT VERSUS PPT

YOU DIDN'T TACKLE THE ISSUE OF WHETHER SPACE-TIME IS DISCRETE OR NOT AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS MIGHT BE ON THAT
WHAT JUMPS TO MY MIND IS THAT IF SPACETIME IS SOME SORT OF GRID THIS FORCES A PREFERRED DIRECTION ANISOTROPY WHICH SHOULD IN PRINCIPLE BE MEASURABLE I BELIEVE EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE TO THIS EFFECT OBSERVING GAMMA RAY BURSTS FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND FOUND NOTHING AND SO I'M INCLINED TO SAY THAT SPACE IS CONTINUOUS DO YOU THINK THIS IS A DEFENSIBLE ARGUMENT
HELLO DR PURYEAR THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS

DO YOU THINK LEIBNIZES IDEA THAT THIS IS THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS HOLDS WATER HAS ANY TRUTH TO IT I KNOW RESPONDS WITH HIS BOOK CANDIDE AND CALLS OUT HIS IDEA AS FOOLISH

BESIDES THE FACT THAT THE WORLD ISN'T PERFECT AT LEAST IT SEEMS THAT WAY TO MOST PEOPLE IS THERE ANY OTHER REASON TO REJECT THEODICY ASSUMING THAT YOU DO REJECT IT

2 I SAW AN INTENSEST OF YOURS IS ETHICS AND I HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING WHY AN ATHEIST SHOULD HAVE AN OBLIGATION OR DESIRE TO EXCEPT TO USE ETHICAL CONDUCT TO BE WELL LIKED AND HELP YOURSELF ACT ETHICALLY
THIS IS PROBABLY A BIG QUESTION TO TACKLE BUT WHY DO YOU THINK ATHEISTS SHOULD ACT ETHICALLY

I AM A PHILOSOPHY STUDENT WAS MAJOR NOW A MINOR CAUSE MY NEW COLLEGE DOESN'T HAVE THE MAJOR AND AM VERY INTERESTED IN ATTENDING GRADUATE SCHOOL AND MAYBE EVEN GOING ON TO GET A PHD DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR ME AS I PURSUE THIS GOAL BESIDES THE ADVICE OF NOT GOING SINCE THE CHANCES OF GETTING A JOB ARE SLIM HAHA

YOU CAN BE AN IDIOT OR BIASED OR A HYPOCRITE

YOU CAN BE WRONG

YOU CAN MAKE A BAD ARGUMENT BECAUSE YOU ARE AN IDIOT

BUT IF I SUGGEST YOUR ARGUMENT IS WRONG BECAUSE YOU ARE AN IDIOT THEN THAT'S AD HOMINEM
I'M GLAD THE VIDEO GOES A BIT INTO THE TU QUOGUE VERSION OF THIS FALLACY I'VE BEEN SEEING SUCH APPEALS TO HYPOCRISY BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMON ON REDDIN

A PERSON NOT ACTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR ARGUMENT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEIR ARGUMENT IS INVALID
IT'S BEST NOT TO INSULT OTHERS WHEN YOU CAN HELP IT BUT I FIND IT ANNOYING HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK ANY INSULT IS AN AD HOMINEM IF I REFUTE YOUR ARGUMENT AND THEN SCOLD YOU FOR YOUR IGNORANCE THAT ISN'T AN AD HOMINEM JUST BECAUSE I PERSONALLY INSULTED YOU THE INSULT WASN'T THE BASIS OF MY ARGUMENT
REMEMBER RECALLING A HISTORY OF BEING A LIAR IS NOT AN AD HOMINEM NOR A GENETIC FALLACY BECAUSE IT IS RELEVANT TO SETTING THE BAYESIAN PRIORS NECESSARY TO JUDGE THE VERACITY OF ANY NEW MESSAGE CONVEYED BY THE MESSAGE-BEARER
THIS VIDEO IS OBVIOUSLY USELESS BECAUSE THERE IS A SPELLING ERROR AT AND A GUY WHO CAN'T SPELL CIRCUMSTANCE CORRECTLY OBVIOUSLY HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL AD HOMINEM EVEN MEANS
I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT AD HOMINEM HAS NO PLACE IN A DISCUSSION OF IDEAS AND POLICY

BUT IT IS NOT AD HOMINEM TO SAY THAT SOMEONE'S CHARACTER DISQUALIFIES THEM FROM ACTING IN A CERTAIN ROLE THAT REQUIRES PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS DISCUSSED OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS AND THAT SORT OF CRITICISM IS ABSOLUTELY VALID

EDIT THANKS AUTOCORRECT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT AS HOMINEM
THE IDEA THAT YOU SHOULD WIN AN ARGUMENT VIA LOGIC THAN VIA APPEALING TO EMOTION IS VERY IDEALISTIC AND THEORETIC BUT ALSO IMPRACTICAL

STUDY HAVE SHOWN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO PERSUADE PEOPLE IS OFTEN THROUGH EVOKING THEIR EMOTION NOT TO COUNTER THEM WITH DATA OR RESEARCH WITH THE RIGHT POSTURE PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS EFFECTIVE USE OF SIMPLE LANGUAGE AND SHOWING OF COMPASSION EVEN THE SIMPLEST AND LEAST SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN STATEMENT WOULD GATHER GREAT SUPPORTERS THAT'S BECAUSE HUMAN FIRST INSTINCTIVELY REACT TO INFORMATION VIA EMOTION THEN PROCESS IT WITH LOGIC

IN RECENT YEARS I BELIVE THE IDEA OF LOGICAL ARGUING IS AS EFFECTIVE AS CLASSICAL ECONOMICS IN REAL WORLD WHICH IS MINIMAL SCHOLARS CAN ARGUE WITH THAT STYLE AS MUCH AS THEY WANT WITHIN THEIR FORUM OR THEATRE BUT IF THEY WANT TO CONVINCE THE SOCIETY AND PUSH CHANGES IN A GREATER SCALE THEY SHOULD RECOGNISED THIS IS SORT OF WASTING TIME
THE ELECTION AND IN SOME WAY FIRST ONE HAS PROVEN THAT ALREADY
TL W
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO PAUL HENNE DUKE UNIVERSITY DESCRIBES THE AD HOMINEM FALLACY WHICH IS AN INFORMAL FALLACY THAT ARISES WHEN SOMEONE ATTACKS THE PERSON MAKING AN ARGUMENT RATHER THAN THE ARGUMENT ITSELF HE ALSO DESCRIBES THE FOUR SUBTYPES OF THIS FALLACY

WIPHI
WHILE AD HOMINEM ARE BAD AND FAR TOO FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE I ACTUALLY THINK THIS VIDEO DOES A POOR JOB OF PRESENTING WHAT IT IS AND WHY IT IS BAD IT TAKES FAR TOO LONG FOCUSING ON THINGS THAT SEEM MURKY TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT FALLACIES WITHOUT CLEARLY EXPLAINING WHY IT'S SO WRONG

IT GOES THROUGH EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE ONLY SAYING THAT THE AD HOMINEM DOESN'T DISPROVE THE ARGUMENT WHICH OF COURSE IT DOESN'T BUT NOT REALLY PROVIDING AN EXAMPLE AS TO WHAT COULD HAVE

YOU CAN DRIVE THE POINT HOME MUCH EARLIER AND EASIER BY CONTINUING ONLY SLIGHTLY WITH THE FIRST EXAMPLE X IS A JERK THEREFORE HIS ARGUMENT ABOUT Y IS WRONG IF THAT WAS A VALID ARGUMENT THEN THIS WOULD APPLY TO EVERY ARGUMENT X MAKES EVEN OBVIOUS ONES WITH CONCLUSIONS NO ONE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE DETAILS ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF AD HOMINEM ARE FINE BUT I DON'T THINK THIS GIVES A GOOD ENOUGH FOUNDATION BEFORE DELVING IN TO THOSE
LET THIS BE A GUIDE FOR THE NEXT YEARS

OR YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE THAT THIS ALWAYS HAS BEEN A COMMON TACTIC IN POLITICS AND ALWAYS WILL BE CRITICAL THINKING DOESN'T HAVE A TIME LIMIT
SOMETIMES AD HOMINEM WHILE NOT GOOD LOGIC FUNCTIONS AS AN EXCELLENT HEURISTICS WHILE IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT I CAN'T LOGICALLY SAY YOUR ARGUMENT IS BAD BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT ON WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IT'S STILL REASONABLE TO NOT TAKE YOUR ARGUMENTS ON THAT SUBJECT SERIOUSLY
THERE'S ONLY SO LONG YOU CAN CALL YOUR OPPONENTS RACISTS SEXISTS AND BIGOTS WITHOUT ADDRESSING THEIR IDEAS UNTIL SOMEONE LIKE TRUMP COMES ALONG

WE LIBERALS NEED TO TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK IN THE MIRROR


AS A NON-AMERICAN WHENEVER I SEE PARTS OF YOUR DEBATE I AM TORN BETWEEN LAUGHING AND CRYING RATHER THAN DISCUSSING POLICIES OR TRYING TO EXPLAIN THEIR POINT OF VIEW ITS MULTIPLE HOURS OF TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE OPPONENT BY INSULTING AND RIDICULING THEM
I'VE KNOWN ABOUT THE AD HOMINEM FOR YEARS AND IT'S STILL MY FAVORITE ARGUMENT TO USE IN A DEBATE

GRANTED I'M USUALLY MORE INTERESTED IN DERAILING A DEBATE THAN DISCUSSING AN ISSUE CONSTRUCTIVELY
POINTING OUT THAT TRUMP IS UNFIT TO BE A PRESIDENT BECAUSE OF HIS CHARACTER FLAWS IS NOT AN AD HOMINEM
TODAY S WALL STREET JOURNAL STORY ABOUT THERANOS IS FACTUALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY ERRONEOUS AND GROUNDED IN BASELESS ASSERTIONS BY INEXPERIENCED AND DISGRUNTLED FORMER EMPLOYEES AND INDUSTRY INCUMBENTS THE SOURCES RELIED ON IN THE ARTICLE TODAY WERE NEVER IN A POSITION TO UNDERSTAND THERANOS TECHNOLOGY AND KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE PROCESSES CURRENTLY EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE ITS STORY MORE DRAMATIC THIS REPORTER RELIED ONLY ON THE VIEWS OF FOUR ANONYMOUS DISGRUNTLED FORMER EMPLOYEES COMPETITORS AND THEIR ALLIES INSTEAD OF REACHING OUT TO MANY OF THE SCIENTIFIC HEALTH CARE AND BUSINESS LEADERS WHO HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN TESTED USED AND EXAMINED OUR BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGIES
FALLACIES ARE ONLY RELEVANT IF THE DISCUSSION IS ASSUMED TO BE RATIONAL THOUGH WE'RE WAY PAST THAT
THE BEST POST SEEN ALL DAY
THE PROBLEM WITH LEARNING TO AVOID LOGICAL FALLACIES IS THAT IN A REAL WORLD DEBATE THEY ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FACTS AS WE HAVE SEEN TIME AND AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD DEBATER YOU NEED TO KEEP THESE TOOLS IN YOUR ARSENAL UNFORTUNATELY YOU'RE NOT DEBATING IN FRONT OF ACADEMICS OR COMPUTERS FOR THE MOST PART YOU'RE TRYING TO CONVINCE A GROUP OF IDIOTS
AD HOMINEM DOESN'T REALLY APPLY TO THIS ELECTION LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF EACH CANDIDATE'S NEGATIVE QUALITIES

CLINTON CHEATER LIAR NEGLIGENT YEAH NORMALLY AND ESPECIALLY FROM SOMEBODY LIKE TRUMP YOU'D THINK THAT'S JUST SOME BABY THROWING INSULTS TO MISDIRECT FROM THE ISSUES HOWEVER THOSE AREN'T MISDIRECTIONS THOSE WERE QUITE LITERALLY HER ISSUES SHE CHEATED AND LIED HER WAY THROUGH THE PRIMARIES

WHILE TRUMP IS AN UNKNOWN VOTING FOR HILLARY IS AN EVEN BIGGER UNKNOWN BECAUSE NOT ONLY WOULD YOU HAVE TO GAUGE HER QUALIFICATIONS YOU'D HAVE TO GAUGE HER INTENTIONS HOW DO YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT SOMEBODY STANDS FOR IF SHE JUST LIES

TRUMP BIGOTED UNQUALIFIED UNEDUCATED SURE YOU CAN CALL SOMEBODY ALL OF THESE THINGS WITHOUT A REASON WHY AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE POINTLESS NAME-CALLING BUT IT STEMS FROM PROMISES HAVING TO EXPLAIN WHY TRUMP IS A BIGOT WOULD BE LIKE BEATING A DEAD HORSE EVEN HIS SUPPORTERS HAVE ALREADY ACCEPTED THAT HIS PERCEIVED LACK OF QUALIFICATION STEMS FROM HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE WE QUESTIONED ABILITY DUE TO HIS AGE SO WHY CAN'T WE QUESTION TRUMP DUE TO HIM HOLDING THE HIGHEST POSITION OF POWER IN A COMPLETELY NEW FIELD

ADDITIONALLY IF YOU DON'T MAKE YOUR DECISIONS BASED ON SCIENCE THEN YOU'RE ACTING ON VARIOUS LOGICAL FALLACIES ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT US PRONE TO BIAS OR JUST MADE-UP B SOUTH PEOPLE AREN'T CALLING TRUMP AN IDIOT JUST TO BE INSULTING THE MAN IS LITERALLY REJECTING SCIENCE

TL R THEIR NEGATIVE LABELS DIRECTLY STEM FROM THEIR PROMISES AND OR ACTIONS
I'M A BIT CONFUSED IF YOU'RE A AND SOMEONE DESCRIBES YOU THUSLY EVEN IF IT'S PATENTLY OBVIOUS IS THAT AN AD HOMINEM
WELL GREAT NOW REDDIN WILL BE SCREAMING AD HOMINEM TO EACH OTHER AND STILL NOT KNOW ENTIRELY WHAT IT MEANS ANYONE REMEMBER THE BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATIONS DAYS OR BETTER YET THE REDDITION WHO CRIED STRAWMAN LEGACY THAT STILL LIVES ON
WHAT IF THE PERSON IS A COMPLETE IDIOT SHOULD WE HAVE TO LOGICALLY ARGUE EVERY FUCKING THING THAT COMES OUT OF THIS IDIOT'S FACE

NUMBER

IF HE IS INDEED A COMPLETE IDIOT THEN WE CAN USE THIS AS A VALID REASON TO NEVER LISTEN TO ANOTHER WORD

SEVERAL EXAMPLES COME TO MIND BUT RUDY GIULIANI FITS THE BILL NICELY
REMOVED
HELLO

NOT ALL AD HOMINEM ATTACKS ARE FALLACIES I'D ALSO ADD THERE IS AN ART TO A GOOD PERSONAL INSULT WHICH WILL SCORE POINTS IN A DEBATE

ANYWAY
DELETED
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN AD HOMINEM ARGUMENT AND A SCARECROW ARGUMENT
THANK YOU FOR SHARING
I IMAGINE WE'LL BE SEEING THIS ON REDDIN A LOT
YAY NEW VOCABULARY ANYONE KNOW HOW THIS WOULD BE USED IN A SENTENCE
THIS SHOULD BE POSTED ON A BIWEEKLY BASIS
LIARS ARE GOING TO LIE
THE STUPID ARE GOING TO ACT STUPID
THOSE WITH A FINANCIAL INTEREST ARE OFTEN GOING TO ACT IN THEIR FINANCIAL INTEREST

LOTS OF TIMES AD HOMINEM ARGUMENTS GIVE SOLID EVIDENCE THAT AN ARGUMENT IS WRONG


BUT MY FEELINGS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT
HOW DOES THIS WORK WITH AN APPEAL TO AUTHORITY OUT OF DOCTORS AGREE THAT THEN AN AD HOMINEM OF DOCTORS USED TO RECOMMEND CERTAIN BRANDS OF CIGARETTES
THIS VIDEO MAY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST YOUTUBE VIDEO LONGER THAN MINUTES I'VE ACTUALLY WATCHED AND 2 BEEN THE FIRST POST ON THIS THREAD I'VE EVEN VIEWED COMMENTS FOR THANK YOU OP FOR REMINDING ME OF A STRONG YET LATENT INTEREST IN PHILOSOPHY
REMOVED
I HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF THESE VIDEOS NOW WITH THEM PRETENDING TO WRITE OUT WORDS WHY DO THEY DO THIS AND HOW DO THEY DO THIS WHY NOT JUST PRESENT THE ANIMATIONS
QUESTION IS POINTING OUT HYPOCRISY AD HOMINEM
PEOPLE DO THIS LITERALLY ALL THE TIME IT GOES STRAIGHT INTO CHARACTER ASSASSINATION I OFTEN WONDER IF THIS IS LARGELY AN AMERICAN THING BECAUSE IT SEEMS MOST PROMINENT HERE IT'S VERY HARD TO HAVE AN INTELLECTUAL DEBATE OR CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE PEOPLE WITH OPPOSING VIEWS VERBAL VIOLENCE AND INSULTS ARE NOW THE NORM IT'S DAMAGING AND UNPRODUCTIVE
THANKS ENJOYED THAT

THIS SORT OF ABUSE IN AUSTRALIAN MEDIA MADE ME FURIOUS
THEY NEVER LOOKED AT TRUMPS POLICIES BUT INSTEAD JUST MOCKED SOME LOUD MOUTH THING HE SAID
HE HAS SAID SOME STUPID SHITTY THINGS BUT YOU TRIED TO FIND ANY OF HIS POLICIES IN MAIN STREAM MEDIA YOU SIMPLY FIND AEDICULE

FUNNILY ENOUGH NOW THAT HES WON WE ARE HEARING IN AUSTRALIA MORE ABOUT HIS POLICIES LESS JOKES AND MORE NEGATIVE CLINTON PRESS

ITS KIND FO SICKENING TO THINK THAT IF CLINTON WON WE WOULD STILL JUST BE ATTACKING PEOPLES CHARACTERS AND NOT LOOKING AT THEIR ARGUMENTS GOOD POST
I GUESS THE TL R OF THIS IS

JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS A DICK IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE WRONG

NICE VIDEO THOUGH WELL PUT TOGETHER AND EXPLAINS THINGS VERY CLEARLY I JUST WISH MORE PEOPLE IN LIFE UNDERSTOOD THESE POINTS
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE'S A DICK DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE WRONG SURE

BUT USUALLY PEOPLE ARE DICKS BECAUSE THEY ARE WRONG AND AGGRESSIVE ABOUT IT
IS IT REALLY SO THOUGH

IN THE FIRST EXAMPLE VLAD CLAIMS

CATS STAY INDOORS AND USE THE LITTER BOX
2 WHILE DOGS NEED TO BE WALKED AND THEY HAVE TO RUN OUTSIDE DOGS ARE JUST MORE WORK
THEREFORE CATS ARE BETTER DOMESTIC PETS THAN DOGS

THIS IS A SEQUENCE OF STATEMENTS THAT A PERSON MIGHT MAKE IT CERTAINLY HAS THE FORM THAT MANY OTHER HUMAN STATEMENTS HAVE BUT PEOPLE HAVE SAID THINGS LIKE THIS RECENTLY IN MEDIEVAL TIMES AND WELL BEFORE THE GREEKS FORMALIZED LOGIC IT'S A NATURAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR

TO SAY THAT AND 2 ARE PREMISES AND THAT IS THE CONCLUSION WHICH SUPPOSEDLY FOLLOWS FROM AND 2 IS TO OVERLAY A FRAMEWORK OVER HUMAN COMMUNICATION THIS FRAMEWORK INTENTIONALLY HIDES THE HUMAN BEHIND THE WORDS SO IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THAT SOMEONE DISCUSSING WHAT CONSTITUTES A VALID ARGUMENT WOULD IF HE USES THIS FRAMEWORK COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AD HOMINEM ARE INADMISSIBLE

IN THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE FROM THE VIDEO VLAD AND HIS JUDGMENT IS HIDDEN THE PREMISE PREMISE CONCLUSION FRAMEWORK MAKES IT SEEM AS THOUGH VLAD EXERCISED HIS POWER OF JUDGMENT IN THE INTELLECTUAL GAP BETWEEN HAVING 2 PREMISES AND DRAWING THE CONCLUSION THAT CATS ARE BETTER PETS THAN DOGS BUT HE ACTUALLY EXERCISED HIS JUDGMENT EARLIER WHEN HE JUDGED THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE TO PUT WORK INTO A IN THE BIBLE PETER ONCE THAT IS DONE DRAWING THE CONCLUSION THAT CATS ARE BETTER PETS THAN DOGS IS REALLY A NO BRAINER AND ANY ONE OF US WOULD DO IT IF WE HAD THE SAME PREMISES THE TROUBLE IS THAT WE DON'T WE MIGHT POSIT THAT CATS PROVIDE INSUFFICIENT AFFECTION OR THAT DOGS ARE MORE INTELLIGENT WITH THE HIDDEN ASSUMPTION THAT INTELLIGENCE IS INHERENTLY VALUABLE OF COURSE OR THAT DOGS ARE BETTER AT ENTERTAINING KIDS BUT YOUR UNIQUE VIEWPOINT AS AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT EXPRESSED IN POSITING THE SAME THINGS AS SOMEONE ELSE AND COMING TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION YOUR UNIQUE VIEWPOINT IS THE DIFFERENT SET OF PREMISES THAT YOU WOULD ADOPT REGARDING CATS VS DOGS AS PETS

WITHOUT EMPLOYING AD HOMINEM THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT WOULD SIMPLY BE YOU OUTLINING WHAT YOU'VE POSITED AND THE OTHER PARTY OUTLINING WHAT THEY'VE POSITED YOU'LL SAY YOUR PREMISES ARE MORE WEIGHTY OR YOU'LL TRY TO SAY THAT HIS PREMISES IN FACT IMPLY YOUR CONCLUSION OR THAT HIS PREMISES CAN ALL BE CONCEPTUALIZED UNDER SOME PRINCIPLE THAT WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF HE ACCEPTED YOUR PREMISES THE ULTIMATE RESULT IS TYPICALLY THAT BOTH SIDES WALK AWAY JUST AS RESOLUTE IN THEIR POSITIONS BUT SOMETIMES ONE MAY BE PERSUADED TO SEE THINGS AS ANOTHER PERSON SEES THEM

THAT REALLY IS THE ISSUE IS VLAD JUST INCIDENTALLY A JERK DOES BEING A JERK HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH PREFERRING CATS TO DOGS WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE BETWEEN YOU AND VLAD WHY DID YOU DISAGREE ABOUT CATS AND DOGS IN THE FIRST PLACE IF YOU WERE PERSUADED BY A WHITE SUPREMACIST THAT THE BLACK RACE IS INHERENTLY INFERIOR TO THE WHITE RACE WOULD THE ONLY CHANGE THAT OCCURRED IN YOU BE YOUR VIEW ON THE BLACK RACE IF YOU WERE NOT HATEFUL PRIOR TO YOUR CONVERSION WOULD YOU REMAIN THAT WAY IN A WORLD WHERE STUDIES FIND PEOPLE HOLDING CERTAIN BELIEFS PERCEIVE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY THAT IS IT IS FILTERED FOR THEM BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IT CAN YOU REALLY SAY THAT THE ONLY THING AT STAKE IN ANY ARGUMENT IS AN ISOLATED INTELLECTUAL POSITION

IF NOT THEN PERHAPS YOU MIGHT FIND SOME MERIT IN AN AD HOMINEM

I ADMIT THAT IN THE CASE OF CAT VS DOG BEING A JERK PROBABLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PREFERENCE IF IT DID I WOULD SUSPECT THAT CORRELATION WOULD BE THE REVERSE OF WHAT WAS PRESENTED IN THE VIDEO BUT NOT EVERY ARGUMENT IS ABOUT A SIMPLE TOPIC UPON WHICH MANY MILLIONS HAVE OPINED SO THAT YOU MAY SEE THAT PEOPLE OF ALL TYPES EXIST ON EVERY SIDE OF THE FENCE FOR INSTANCE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT BEING AND TIME WAS ENTIRELY INCIDENTAL TO NAZISM YOU DIDN'T EXACTLY HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE INDEPENDENTLY COMING TO THE SAME CONCLUSIONS AS HEIDEGGER WHILE STAYING CLEAR OF NAZISM THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL ASSURANCE THAT THE TWO ARE UNRELATED
AS AN ILLUSTRATION FOR COMMON INTELLECTUAL TORPIDITY THIS VIDEO IS GOOD BUT IF SOMEONE IS AN ANTI INTELLECTUAL THEY ARE AGAINST REASON MR PHILOSOPHER THIS IS NOT A FLEETING PROBLEM

THERE IS NO BEAUTY IN THAT THING AND WHILE THE HEART THING CAN GUIDE WE REALLY ARE PRESENTED WITH NOTHING TO LOVE HENCE FORECLOSING JUDGMENT

HUMANISM

NICE VIDEO DIDACTIC
IT'S NOT AD HOMINEM WHEN IT'S TRUE EXAMPLE LAST SPANISH ELECTION I WAS COMPLAINING PP VOTERS ARE PRO FASCIST AND THEN SOMEONE WITH A TWITTER HANDLE THAT SAYS COUNTRY KING AND GOD TOLD ME THAT NOT EVERYONE TM SO THERE
THE VIDEO DOESN'T ACTUALLY EXPLAIN HOW TO AVOID AD HOMINEM BUT RATHER WHY TO AVOID THEM THIS SEEMS LIKE A GREAT EDUCATIONAL VIDEO TO SHOW IGNORANT PEOPLE DURING AN ARGUMENT
PEOPLE JUST LOOK AT ME AND IMMEDIATELY DISCOUNT MY OPINION AD HOMINEM ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE TIME THEIR RIGHT
I ACTUALLY HAD A FINAL EXAM TODAY AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS ON AD HOMINEM BIAS THOUGHT I WAS JUST PROCRASTINATING ON REDDIN WHEN I WATCHED THIS VIDEO BUT I WAS ACTUALLY STUDYING THANK YOU REDDIN
OP THANKS FOR SHARING THAT VIDEO
BLDR VERSION AD HOMINEM PERSONAL ATTACK INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE ARGUMENT
WASN T ALL OF THAT JUST COMMON SENSE GIVEN FORMAL DEFINITIONS I GUESS THIS IS A GOOD REMINDER TO PEOPLE TO WATCH OUT FOR WHEN SOMEONE USES IT BUT I M SURPRISED IT WAS MADE TO BE AN MINUTE LONG VIDEO
SO IN MY EXPERIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS I GET ACCUSED OF AD HOMINEM ATTACKS OFTEN BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY SAY THEM I SAY YOU ARE MISINFORMED BECAUSE YOU LISTEN TO BAD NEWS SOURCES THE PERSON DISMISSES ME BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M CALLING THEM INHERENTLY STUPID WHICH IS NOT THE CASE I FIND THIS COMING OFTEN FROM THE REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE SIDE YOU ARE RACIST FOR SAYING A LOT OF MEXICANS ARE RAPISTS THEN PEOPLE DISMISS IT AS AN AD HOMINEM ATTACK BUT DON'T LOOK AT HOW SAYING SOMETHING LIKE THAT CONVEYS A CERTAIN MESSAGE WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THE ENTIRE TRUMP CANDIDACY WORKED ON THIS PRINCIPLE WRITING OFF EVERY CRITICISM AS AN AD HOMINEM WHEN THEY ACTUALLY WEREN'T
WHEN A LEADER MAKES ALL THE DECISIONS AND YOU HAVE NO SAY IN THESE DECISIONS IS IT THEN NOT A GIVEN TO CRITICISE THE LEADER CRITICISING THEIR POLICIES ACHIEVES NOTHING AND IS DIVISIVE WHILE CRITICIZING THE PERSON IS POLARISING AND ACHIEVES A GREATER CHANGE

THIS IS WHY POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS RELY SO HEAVILY ON AD HOMINEM ATTACKS BECAUSE FALLACY OR NOT IT ACHIEVES RESULTS

AD HOMINEM IS ONLY A FALLACY IF IT IS INEFFECTIVE IN WINNING AN ARGUMENT
EVEN IF AD HOMINEM HAS NO PLACE IN AN STRUCTURED ARGUMENTATION IS THE MOST POWRERFULL TO CATCH HUBLI AUDIENCE
OK LOVE THIS VIDEO BUT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE TO THE PERSON FALLACY APPLIES IN RELATION TO EXPERTS NO ONE CAN BE AN EXPERT ON ALL THINGS AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO PERFORM IN ROLES WITHOUT REQUIRING US TO ANALYZE EVERY SINGLE ARGUMENT THEY MAKE IF EVEN WE COULD BECAUSE OF COURSE WE'RE NOT THE EXPERT IN MOST CASES DON'T WE NEED TO MAKE JUDGEMENTS OF CHARACTER INFLUENCE AND LACK OF HYPOCRISY INTEGRITY IN ORDER TO DELEGATE A JOB TO A PERSON THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A CROSS POST BETWEEN R POLITICS AND R PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE YOUR TITLE AND MOST OF THE COMMENTS I'VE READ ARE SAYING NOT TO DISCOUNT ARGUMENTS BUT TO ME IT SEEMS KIND OF A SILLY ARGUMENT TO MAKE IN THE GRANDER SCHEME OF THINGS
WATCH V IVFK

THIS EXPLANATION IS MORE SUCCINCT AND ACCESSIBLE
HE MAKES A DISTINCTION BETWEEN AD HOMINEM AND CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS BUT DOESN'T GO ON FURTHER ANYONE CARE TO ELABORATE
THEN AGAIN I'VE FOUND THAT THE WORLD DOES NOT USE INFORMAL LOGIC OR FORMAL WHATSOEVER MUCH LESS THAN TAKE IN MIND INFORMAL FALLACIES
I BELIEVE A WISE MAN ONCE SAID POLITICS AIN'T PHILOSOPHY IT'S IN MANY WAYS THE INTENTIONAL ABSENCE OF IT
WAIT ISN'T A GOOD PORTION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM BASED USING THESE
WAIT I'M SORRY REALLY NOT TRYING TO STAND ON TALLER GROUND BUT WAS THERE IS THERE A SINGLE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVES A PERSON'S STANDING IS THE SOLE REASON WHY A COMMENT OR ARGUMENT IS RIGHT WRONG

JUST BECAUSE HITLER IS A JERK DOESN'T SOMEHOW MEAN THAT IF HE SAYS 2 2 HE SOMEHOW BECOMES WRONG WE ALL KNOW THIS 2 2 IS A TRUE STATEMENT JUST BECAUSE HITLER IS A JERK IT DOES NOT BECOME UNTRUE THAT'S JUST COMMON SENSE


DOES ANYONE THINK CALLING SOMEONE A JERK OR STUPID SOMEHOW WINS THEM THE DEBATE
THAT WAS REALLY CALMING
THIS STRAW MAN AND CHERRY PICKING ARE FALLACIES I'VE SEEN PLAGUE EVERY DAY RHETORIC
NOT SURE WHY WE NEEDED AN ADDITIONAL MIN FIRST MIN AND A HALF WAS PLENTY NICE AID
I WISH MORE PEOPLE WOULD LEARN THIS

IT SEEMS THAT EVERY ARGUMENT I HAVE SEEN REGARDING POLITICS RESULTS IN NAME CALLING
FUCKING THE ONE FALLACY THEY TEACH IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS YET NOBODY LISTENS AND THEN THEY JUST SPEND THEIR ENTIRE YELLING AT PEOPLE THEY DISAGREE WITH
IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE CAVEATS ALREADY MENTIONED THERE IS ANOTHER FALLACY CALLED APPEAL TO AUTHORITY WHICH STATES THAT SIMPLY ARGUING THAT X IS TRUE BECAUSE SOME AUTHORITY FIGURE SAYS SO IS NOT SOUND HOWEVER A LINKED CAVEAT HERE IS THAT YES SOMETIMES A PERSON'S AUTHORITY ON A SUBJECT CAN BE LOGICALLY USED TO SUBSTANTIATE WHAT ESSENTIALLY AMOUNTS TO NECESSARY FAITH IN THAT AUTHORITY'S EXPERTISE SO NOW WHEN DEBATING A SUBJECT WITH A PERSON WHO ASSERTS HIS OWN SUPPOSED AUTHORITY ON A SUBJECT AS A SUPPLEMENTATION TO HIS ARGUMENT IN OTHERWISE LOGICAL FASHION THAT IS TO SAY HE IS NOT USING HIS EXPERTISE TO MAKE LOGICAL CONNECTIONS HE IS USING IT TO ESTABLISH PREMISES OR ESOTERIC FACTS THAT YOU WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE NO ABILITY TO VERIFY THEN YOU CAN ASSERT IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE FOR IT YOU ARE AN IDIOT AND SO I REJECT YOUR SUPPOSED AUTHORITY ON THIS SUBJECT

THAT'S PERFECTLY LOGICAL PEOPLE WILL CALL IT AN AD HOMINEM WHEN YOU SAY IT IN THIS CONTEXT BUT THEY'RE WRONG
AND TO SUM IT ALL UP ITS HARD TO WIN A ARGUMENT WITH A SMART PERSON IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH A INCOMPETENT ONE
FUNNY HOW EVERYONE HERE IS DEFENDING AD HOMINEM ATTACKS

IN THE TOP COMMENT CHAIN I TYPICALLY ONLY USE AN AD HOMINEM ATTACK WHEN I NO LONGER WISH TO RECONSTRUCT THE OPPONENTS ARGUMENT

THIS IS THE EXACT KIND OF THINKING THAT AD HOMINEM PROMOTES

YOU ARE ASSUMING THAT YOUR ARGUMENT IS CORRECT FROM THE BEGINNING AND THAT YOUR ONLY TASK IS TO REFUTE THE OPPONENTS INCORRECT ARGUMENT

PERHAPS YOUR ARGUMENT IS INCORRECT YOU WOULD NOT BE AWARE OF THIS BECAUSE IT IS WHAT YOU TRULY BELIEVE BUT YOU ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO ARGUE YOUR POINT OF VIEW AND SIMPLY RESORTING TO ATTACKS ON THE OPPONENTS CHARACTER DOES LITTLE TO DEFEND YOUR STANDPOINT

IF YOU ARE UNWILLING TO CONTINUE TO DEBATE SOMEONES ARGUMENT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IM RIGHT YOURE WRONG GO AWAY AND YOURE AN INSULT INSULT INSULT SHUT-UP

NOTHING THEY ARE BOTH CHILDISH AND DELUSIONAL IF AN ARGUMENT BY ITS NATURE IS SO FLAWED THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO DEBATE IT WOULD IT NOT BE EASIER FIND AND GIVE ONE OR TWO REASONS AS TO WHY IT IS INCORRECT

MOST OF THE COMMENTS IVE SEEN SOUND LIKE THEYRE COMING FROM ARTICULATE TODDLERS VERY VERBOSE YET WITH FLAWED REASONING
THE AD HOMINEM FALLACY DOES NOT APPLY WHEN TRYING TO DETERMINE A PERSONS STANCE ON AN ARGUMENT IT IS NOT A SURPRISE THAT POLITICIANS LIE CHARACTER IS ONE OF THE BEST DETERMINING FACTORS WHETHER A PERSON IS TELLING A LIE ABOUT A THEIR STANCE ON AN ARGUMENT

AD HOMINEM IS ONLY A FALLACY WHEN USED TO ATTACK AN ARGUMENT DIRECTLY LIKE TRYING TO ATTACK THE CONCLUSION BELOW WITH CHARACTER ASSASSINATION

ARGUMENT MUSIC IS GREAT AND FUN TO LISTEN DANCE TO

STANCE ON THE ARGUMENT I LOVE MUSIC TOO

CHARACTER ASSASSINATION YOU ARE A LIAR AS THE GRENDEL DID YOU NOT MURDER HUNDREDS OF WOMAN CHILDREN AND MEN JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE PLAYING MUSIC AND DANCING

STANCE ON THE ARGUMENT IS NOW IN SERIOUS QUESTION BECAUSE HIS CHARACTER IS IN OPPOSITION TO HIS STANCE

NOTE THAT A PERSONS STANCE ON AN ARGUMENT IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ARGUMENT WE ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE ON WHAT SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT DO THEY TRULY BELONG NOT WHETHER THE ARGUMENT IS INVALID BECAUSE THEY ARE A TERRIBLE PERSON

DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO READ ALL COMMENTS BUT COULD SOMEONE ANSWER ME THIS ARE FEMINIST ARGUMENTS THAT DISREGARD OR INVALIDATE OTHER PERSON'S OPINION BASED ON THEIR GENDER RACE ETHNICITY ETC SUBJECT TO AD HOMINEM FOR EXAMPLE THE ACCUSATIONS OF PLAINING


AD HOMINEM IS NOT NECESSARILY BAD SEE NIETZSCHE
WHAT ABOUT THE RUSSIAN HACKERS FALLACY IS THAT A FORM OF AD HOMINEM OR SIMPLY DODGING THE QUESTION
HE USED A PRETTY BAD EXAMPLE THAT IS WAY TO OBVIOUS
WHERE WERE YOU YEARS AGO
I FOUND INTERESTING THAT STATEMENTS SUCH AS BUT YOU SPEED TOO IN RESPONSE TO YOU'RE DRIVING TOO FAST IT'S UNSAFE ARE AD HOMINEM TOO
THE AD HOMINEM FALLACY AND THE FALLACY FALLACY ARE PROBABLY THE TWO MOST USED FALLACIES ON THE INTERNET
THERE IS NO REASON WHY IT SHOULD TAKE MINUTES TO SAY WHAT AD HOMINEM ARGUMENTS ARE
THE FACT THIS EVEN NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED IS TERRIBLY WORRISOME


I GET INTO OBSCURE ARGUMENTS WITH A BUDDY OF MINE ABOUT HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES ALL THE TIME A FAVORITE THING FOR HIM TO SAY DUDE YOU ARE WRONG I HAVE A MASTERS DEGREE IN HISTORY IS THIS AD HOMINEM SINCE HES IMPLYING MY ARGUMENT IS INVALID BECAUSE MY EDUCATION ISNT IN THE SUBJECT AND NOT A MASTERS DEGREE
VERY GOOD VIDEO HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO AD HOMINEM BEFORE HOWEVER WAS NOT AWARE OF THE SUBCATEGORIES WHENEVER I ARGUE WITH MY MUM SHE IS GONNA USE THE TU QUOGUE ARGUMENT YOU BETTER DON'T TELL ME HOW TO SET MY LIFE STRAIGHT AS YOU CANNOT SET STRAIGHT EITHER SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHENEVER I CRITICIZE HER
I FEEL IF EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT THIS AND WOULD APPLY IT ACCORDINGLY OUR WORLD WOULD BE A WAAAF BETTER PLACE
ALSO I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS USEFUL TO SEE DONALD TRUMP FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW HE MIGHT BE A DOUCHE HE MIGHT BE RACIST OR SEXIST AND WHATNOT BUT CAN HE NOT STILL MAKE A VALID ARGUMENT ON REBUILDING AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE I DO NOT INTEND TO DEFEND HIM IN ANY WAY JUST TRYING TO BE REASONABLE RATHER THAN HISTORIC
LPT REQUEST HOW DOES ONE ARGUE HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS USING AD HOMINEM ARGUMENTS AGAINST THEM
IF A FEW OF CLADS ARGUMENTS ARE VERY VALID BUT A MAJORITY ARE PROVEN TO BE OBJECTIVELY AND CONSISTENTLY INVALID THEN VLAD CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO MAKE MORE VALID ARGUMENTS THAN INVALID ARGUMENTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON STATISTICS

FURTHERMORE IF HITLER HAS DEMONSTRATED CONSISTENTLY ABHORRENT BEHAVIOR REGARDLESS OF THE VALIDITY OF ANY ARGUMENTS HE MAKES DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE IS A VALID LEADER
AN AD HOMINEM IS WHEN YOU ARE LOSING AN ARGUMENT YOU ACCUSE YOUR OPPONENT OF USING AD HOMINEM AND THROW THEM OFF THEIR GAME
I'M GLAD THE VIDEO MENTIONED AT THE END THAT IN SOME CASES THERE ARE PERSONAL CRITICISMS THAT ARE RELEVANT I WAIT FOR THE SECOND VIDEO I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S MORE USEFUL FOR MOST PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS NOT AD HOMINEM EVEN THOUGHT IT COULD SEEM LIKE IT IS
WHEN ATTACKING ANOTHER'S CHARACTER YOU ARE NOT BEING KIND NOR LOVING THIS MATTERS BECAUSE WHEN YOU ATTACK SOMEONE'S CHARACTER YOU ARE PUTTING THEM ON THE DEFENSIVE WHICH PRETTY MUCH KILLS ALL CHANCES OF COMPROMISE AND MUTUAL RESPECT YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAID NOTHING AT ALL FOR EVERYTHING ELSE SAID AFTER THE AD HOMINEM WILL FALL UPON DEAF EARS I STILL STRUGGLE WITH THIS ALMOST DAILY ON BOTH SIDES
DELETED
WITH THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL AD HOMINEM COULD YOU NOT USE EVIDENCE OF CHARACTER AS A WAY TO MAKE YOUR ARGUMENT NOT FAULTY CATHERINE YOU SAY THAT SINCE ANIMALS ARE SENTIENT THAT EATING ANIMALS IS IMMORAL YET YOU WORK FOR S VEGAN COMPANY IT IS PERMISSIBLE FOR YOU TO DRAW YOUR CONCLUSION BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE TIES TO VEGANISM AS YOU WHAT ABOUT RELIGIOUS SECTS WHO THRIVE ON EATING ANIMALS IS IT THEN MORAL FOR YOU TO CALL THEIR BELIEFS IMMORAL
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS STUFF I ASSUME IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE IT'S SO DAMNED SIMPLE
FOR THE PAST YEAR OR TWO I'VE BEEN IN MY OWN HEAD USING A METRIC BASED ON THE AD HOMINEM FALLACY WHEN HAVING WHAT STARTS OUT AS A REASONABLE DISCUSSION HERE ON REDDIN TIME TO AD HOMINEM I EVEN HAVE A LITTLE ABBREVIATION I USE ATTAH

IT'S CURRENTLY DEFINED AS THE NUMBER OF BACK-AND-FORTH INTERACTIONS WITH AN INTERLOCUTOR MY WIFE SAYS THIS SHOULD BE INTERTEXTUTOR BEFORE THEY USE THE AD HOMINEM FALLACY ACTUALLY WATCHING THIS VIDEO I'M AWARE THAT I SOMETIMES CONFUSE GENERAL INSULTS WITH AD HOMINEM SO I EITHER NEED TO CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF THE METRIC TIME TO AD HOMINEM AND OR INSULT OR BE MORE CAREFUL IN MY ASSESSMENT

ANYWAY I CERTAINLY FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN THAT ATTAH DESCRIBES SOME KEY FEATURES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH CERTAIN PEOPLE ANYHOW
I AM SUPREMELY GUILTY OF AD HOMINEM IT'S EASY TO PERCEIVE PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR IN INDIVIDUALS OR THINK YOU'RE PERCEIVING THEM BUT IT'S NEVER WISE TO ASSUME WHAT TYPE OF PERSON SOMEONE IS AND ATTACK THAT THE GOAL IS TO HELP SOMEONE CHANGE THEIR MIND OR HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR MENTALITY AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE A MIND THAT'S BEEN STEELED AGAINST YOU BECAUSE YOU ATTACKED THE PERSON ATTACHED TO IT
IS THIS LIKE

IF IT LOOKS STUPID AND IT WORKS IT'S NOT STUPID

I THINK THIS CAN BE MISUSED SOMETIMES SOMETIMES A PERSON'S CHARACTER IS THE SUBJECT MATTER ALTHOUGH NOT USUALLY THE PERSON I'M TALKING TO IF AN ELECTION CANDIDATE IS A HYPOCRITE AND A LIAR THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DISCUSSION THE CANDIDATE'S POLICIES ARE IRRELEVANT IF I HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THE CANDIDATE HAS NO INTENTION OF FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THEM OR IF SOMEONE STARTS MAKING APPEALS TO THEIR OWN AUTHORITY THEY SHOULD EXPECT TO HAVE THAT AUTHORITY QUESTIONED
SO LET'S GO AT WHAT THIS POST IS ALLUDING TO LOGICALLY THE AD HOMINEM FALLACY WHAT IT IS AND HOW TO AVOID IT LET THIS BE A GUIDE FOR THE NEXT YEARS IS OBVIOUSLY ALLUDING TO THE ELECTION SPECIFICALLY IT IS ABOUT PERSONAL MORAL FAILINGS USED AS ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE INCOMING ADMINISTRATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS POST ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN LEVIED AGAINST THE CANDIDATE THAT PERSONAL MORAL FAILINGS MAKE HIS POSITIONS INADEQUATE

HOWEVER THE PRESIDENCY IS A MORAL POSITION WHERE MORAL STANDING CONVEYS SOFT AND SOMETIMES HARD POWER AND HAS REAL EFFECTS SO THE PERSONAL MORAL FAILINGS ARE NECESSARILY AND VALIDLY ON TRIAL IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACTUAL POLICY POSITIONS WHICH WERE AND ARE THIN AND VAGUE

THE ADMINISTRATION WHO WON THE ELECTION DE FACTO FAILS IN OBJECTIVE COMPARISON WITH THE LOSER ON POLICY SPECIFICS AS WELL AS MORAL CHARACTER THE SETH MEYERS VIDEO WHICH WAS WIDELY CIRCULATED PRIOR TO THE ELECTION MIGHT BE HELD UP AS AN AD HOMINEM ANALYSIS BUT SINCE IT'S THE PRESIDENCY A FIGUREHEAD KIND OF MORAL AUTHORITY BASED POSITION AS WELL AS ONE WHERE DEMONSTRABLE JUDGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL ERGO POINTS AND THOSE OF OTHERS WHO HAVE ATTACKED HIS PERSONAL MORAL INTELLECTUAL CHARACTER ARE ACTUALLY PERFECTLY VALID CONSIDER GEORGE BUSH WHOSE INTELLECTUAL CHARACTER WERE ALSO IN QUESTION AT THE TIME OF HIS ELECTION AND LOOK WHERE THAT GOT US

EDIT IN CASE I AM SUBJECT TO AN AD HOMINEM ATTACK FOR THIS POSITION I AM WORKING CLASS I WAS WITH BERNIE WE NEED A WORKING CLASS POPULIST REVOLUTION AND A PRESIDENT WITH THE EXPERIENCE MORAL AUTHORITY AND JUDGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE TO GOVERN AND LEAD BECAUSE THAT'S NECESSARILY PART OF THE ASSESSMENT FOR THIS POSITION AND MY ADDING THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE THIS POST NECESSARILY POSITS THAT PERSONAL MORAL CHARACTER ARE NOT PART OF GOVERNING THAT'S WRONG IT'S A NECESSARY PART OF THE AMERICAN OR OTHER PRESIDENCY SO AD HOMINEM IS A VALID ATTACK WHEN IT COMES TO THIS POSITION
SOMETIMES ARGUMENTS ARE SO BAD THEY'RE NOT WORTH REFUTING IT'S EASIER TO START A NEW TOPIC OF DISCUSSION THE IDIOCY OF THE OTHER PERSON
THIS IS A REALLY LONG AND REPETITIVE VIDEO FOR SOMETHING SO SIMPLE
LOVE ME SOME FALLACIES I KIND OF HAVE A FEELING IT WILL BE OPEN SEASON OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS

I HAVE USED YIZKOR TO LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT FALLACIES IN THE PAST ANYONE KNOW OF OTHER GOOD RESOURCES
I'M CONSTANTLY BEING BOMBARDED WITH INFORMATION I CANT POSSIBLY TRY TO EVALUATE THE PREMISES AND CONCLUSION OF EVERY ARGUMENT I ENCOUNTER THEREFORE I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO EMPLOY AD HOMINEM AND WHATEVER OTHER FALLACIES I CAN AS SHORTCUTS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS TRUE OR FALSE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT AND VALUABLE FOR ARRIVING AT QUICK CONCLUSIONS TO LOW IMPACT INFORMATION

ON THE INTERNET IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO EVALUATE THE SOURCE OF ALL INFORMATION AND THE FALLACIES THAT THIS VIDEO TALKS ABOUT ARE ACTUALLY TOOLS THAT YOU SHOULD EMPLOY WHEN DOING YOU EVALUATION

IRONIC
REMOVED

HI ALL I WAS HAVING A DEBATE WITH A FRIEND AND I WAS HOPING SOMEONE COULD CONFIRM MY UNDERSTANDING OF AD HOMINEM I'VE TRIED GOOGLING THIS SPECIFIC EXAMPLE BUT COULDN'T FIND A DIRECT ANSWER

I USED A HISTORICAL QUOTE TO SUPPORT MY ARGUMENT I THINK THE QUOTE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT JUSTICE DON'T REMEMBER NOW MY FRIEND THEN CAME BACK AND ATTACKED THE HISTORICAL CHARACTER TO UNDERMINE MY ARGUMENT WE THEN GOT INTO A VERY LONG AND HEATED ARGUMENT ABOUT HOW AD HOMINEM HAS TO INVOLVE ATTACKING THE PERSON WITH WHOM YOU'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT NOT SOMEONE THAT I INVOKED I BELIEVE HE COMMITTED AD HOMINEM

WOULD ANYONE MIND WEIGHING IN


IF I BASE MY ARGUMENT ON A CHARACTER ATTACK I DON'T HAVE AN ARGUMENT

HOWEVER I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH APPROPRIATE CHARACTERS ATTACKS IN ADDITION TO AN ARGUMENT

IF WE ARE DISCUSSING X AND YOU ARE ALSO BEING AN IDIOT I'LL RESPOND TO X AND THEN CALL YOU AN IDIOT I THINK THAT'S FAIR
AMA

PROFESSOR PURYEAR WILL BE DOING AN AMA THIS UPCOMING MONDAY AT EST RELATED TO HIS WORK IN METAPHYSICS ETHICS AND HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY JOIN THE CONVERSATION HERE BY POSTING QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME AND JOIN US LIVE ON MONDAY AT NOON

ABSTRACT

MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE ARGUED THAT THE PAST MUST BE FINITE IN DURATION BECAUSE OTHERWISE REACHING THE PRESENT MOMENT WOULD HAVE INVOLVED SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE NAMELY THE SEQUENTIAL OCCURRENCE OF AN ACTUAL INFINITY OF EVENTS IN REPLY SOME PHILOSOPHERS HAVE OBJECTED THAT THERE CAN BE NOTHING AMISS IN SUCH AN OCCURRENCE SINCE ACTUALLY INFINITE SEQUENCES ARE TRAVERSED ALL THE TIME IN NATURE FOR EXAMPLE WHENEVER AN OBJECT MOVES FROM ONE LOCATION IN SPACE TO ANOTHER THIS ESSAY FOCUSES ON ONE OF THE TWO AVAILABLE REPLIES TO THIS OBJECTION NAMELY THE CLAIM THAT ACTUAL INFINITIES ARE NOT TRAVERSED IN NATURE BECAUSE SPACE TIME AND OTHER CONTINUOUS WHOLES DIVIDE INTO PARTS ONLY IN SO FAR AS WE DIVIDE THEM IN THOUGHT AND THUS DIVIDE INTO ONLY A FINITE NUMBER OF PARTS I GRANT THAT THIS REPLY SUCCEEDS IN BLUNTING THE OBJECTION BUT I ARGUE THAT IT ALSO SUBVERTS THE VERY ARGUMENT AGAINST AN ETERNAL PAST THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO SAVE

AUTHOR

STEPHEN PURYEAR ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AFFILIATE OF CLASSICAL STUDIES NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY
THIS SEEMS LIKE THE SPOT WHERE PHILOSOPHY AND PHYSICS COLLIDE IT'S A COMPELLING PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT AND IT HAPPILY BREAKS KNOWN LAWS OF PHYSICS WITHOUT BOTHERING TO EXPLAIN HOW SUCH VIOLENCE OCCURRED ASSUMING I AM UNDERSTANDING IT CORRECTLY

IT'S POSSIBLE I'M CONFUSED ABOUT DEFINITION OF BEGINNING IF HE IS DEFININING IT AS THE UNIVERSE HAVING A BEGINNING IN TIME WELL HE ARGUES IT WELL AND MY OBJECTIONS ARE MEANINGLESS IT'S ALSO PRETTY MUCH THE DEFINITION OF THE BIG BANG THEORY TIMELINE AND THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THERE WAS TIME INFINITE OR OTHERWISE PRIOR TO THIS POINT ALTHOUGH THERE MAY HAVE BEEN BUT EITHER WAY WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND OUT FOR SURE IF THIS THEORY IS TRUE AND WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE IT'S NOT THEN THE UNIVERSE NOT ONLY HAD A BEGINNING BUT THAT TIME WAS ROUGHLY BILLION YEARS AGO

IF BY BEGINNING HE MEANS GOING FROM A STATE OF NON-EXISTENCE TO EXISTENCE HOWEVER WE RUN INTO SOME PROBLEMS

THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS STATES THAT MATTER AND ENERGY CANNOT BE CREATED NOR DESTROYED BUT MAY BE CHANGED IN FORM WE HAVE NEVER OBSERVED AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE AND LOGICALLY IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE THAT THE SUM TOTAL OF MATTER AND ENERGY IN THE UNIVERSE IS A CONSTANT VALUE PERHAPS EVEN ZERO EVEN A CONSTANT IS PLAUSIBLE IF THE UNIVERSE HAS A BEGINNING BEFORE WHICH IT DID NOT EXIST BY WHAT PROCESS WAS THIS LAW VIOLATED AND WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE THAT THIS OCCURRED
2 THE IDEA PRESENTED OF PWT PRESUPPOSES THAT TIME AS DEFINED BY PWA EVENTS LEADING TO FURTHER EVENTS IS ABSOLUTE PHYSICISTS HOWEVER GENERALLY SEE TIME AS DEPENDENT ON SPACETIME THE FABRIC OF THE UNIVERSE IF TRUE TIME ITSELF IS DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTENCE OF OUR UNIVERSE AND IS CAUSED BY DISTORTIONS IN SPACE AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL THEREFORE IT IS REASONABLE TO BELIEVE THAT PRIOR IF SUCH A WORD HAS A MEANING TO THE BIG BANG TIME ITSELF DID NOT EXIST IN THE WAY WE IMAGINE IT THERE WAS NO SPACETIME IN WHICH TO CREATE ALTERATIONS SO WHILE TIME MOST LIKELY HAD A BEGINNING IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THE MASS AND ENERGY OF THE UNIVERSE WENT FROM A STATE OF NON-EXISTENCE TO EXISTENCE AS EXISTENCE WOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT ON TIME ONLY A CHANGE IN STATE WHICH UNLIKE ARGUMENT DOES NOT VIOLATE THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

SO WHILE I THINK HIS ARGUMENT IS REASONABLE IN THE FIRST WAY ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT OBVIOUS TO COSMOLOGISTS I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY TRUE AS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE INFINITE PRIOR UNIVERSES AND CAUSATION SIMPLY STOPS APPLYING ONCE SPACETIME COLLAPSES I THINK HE'D HAVE TO PROVE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO A FIRST CAUSE ARGUMENT BUT WITHOUT THE HANDY GOD DID IT SPECIAL PLEADING THAT AQUINAS USED AFTER ALL IF ALL EVENTS MUST HAVE A CAUSE WHAT CAUSED THE FIRST ONE AND IF THAT THING WHATEVER IT IS DOES NOT REQUIRE A PRIOR EVENT WHY DO ALL FOLLOWING EVENTS REQUIRE IT THE ARGUMENT QUICKLY BECOMES SELF-REFUTING

BUT IF HE'S REFERRING TO EXISTENCE ITSELF I THINK HE RUNS INTO SOME MAJOR EMPIRICAL ROADBLOCKS AND WHILE PHILOSOPHERS OFTEN LIKE TO IGNORE REALITY WHEN IT INTERFERES WITH THEIR ARGUMENTS I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ARGUE THAT A PHYSICAL EVENT SUCH AS THE UNIVERSE BEGINNING CAN IGNORE EMPIRICAL DATA
RIGHT OFF THE BAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENDING THE LIVES OF ALREADY LIVING BEINGS AND DENYING TO PROPAGATE NEW ONES I'D ARGUE THAT TAKING THE LIFE OF SOMETHING THAT IS BOTH AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON AND HAS A PREFERENCE NOT TO DIE PREMATURELY IS UNETHICAL WHEREAS DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT TO PROPAGATE A SPECIES IS FAR MORE MUDDY AND RELIES ON THE FEATURES OF THE SPECIFIC SPECIES IN QUESTION

IN ADDITION TO THIS BECAUSE WE ARE FAR MORE SELF AWARE HAVE THE ABILITY TO THINK RATIONALLY WE ARE CAPABLE OF CONCEPTUALISING WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR SPECIES TO BE EXTINCT AND I'D PUT MY MONEY ON COWS NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE THAT CONCEPTUALISATION

LASTLY I DON'T REALLY THINK MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS AROUND ARE CLEAR YOU CAN'T COMPARE THE SUFFERING OF A PERSON THAT EXISTS WITH ONE THAT DOESN'T BECAUSE THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T EXIST AND THEREFORE TRYING TO COME TO AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUFFERING THEY WOULD HYPOTHETICALLY NOT EXPERIENCE IS PRETTY NONSENSICAL I DON'T KNOW THE PRECISE TERMINOLOGY BUT IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE A CATEGORY ERROR WE ARE TRYING TO QUANTIFY SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST IF IT DOESN'T EXIST THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE NUMERICAL VALUE WE ASSIGN TO SUFFERING IS IT MEANS THERE IS NO SUCH VALUE I'M CURRENTLY AN BECAUSE THE PLANET IS ALREADY OVERPOPULATED AND CREATING MORE PEOPLE IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HARM THOSE ALREADY LIVING ON THE PLANET

BACK TO THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IF IT WOULD BE THE CASE THAT WE WOULDN'T BE AWARE OUR SPECIES IS GOING TO DIE OUT WHICH COWS WOULDN'T BE THEN I'D BE HAPPY OR RATHER NO WORSE OFF WITH THE ALIENS DECLINING TO BREED MORE OF US PROVIDING I DIED NONE THE WISER NOT KNOWING THE FATE OF MY SPECIES REMEMBER OUR SHORT LIVES ONLY HOLD VALUE TO US ONCE WE'RE ACTUALLY LIVING THEM BEFORE WE'RE ALIVE NOTHING HOLDS VALUE TO US BECAUSE WE DON'T EXIST

ASKING WHAT DECISION I WOULD MAKE DOESN'T REALLY FIT THE ANALOGY WELL THOUGH BECAUSE WE DON'T GIVE COWS THE DECISION AND I DON'T THINK THEYRE CAPABLE OF MAKING CONCEPTUALISING OR UNDERSTANDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A CHOICE

AT THE END OF THE DAY HUMANE WHILE YOU CAN KILL AN ANIMAL PAINLESSLY THEORETICALLY COWS ARE VERY SOCIAL AND EVEN SEPARATING THEM FROM FAMILY MEMBERS CAN HARM THEM METHODS AREN'T EFFECTIVE SO YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE CAUSING UNNECESSARY SUFFERING AND NO AMOUNT OF ARGUING CAN REALLY SQUARE THAT AWAY IF YOU START WITH THE PREMISE THAT WE SHOULD AVOID CAUSING UNNECESSARY SUFFERING TO ANIMALS
THIS ARGUMENT DOESNT DISCUSS THE REPERCUSSIONS ON US AS HUMANS WE HAVE LESS RESOURCES THAN WE COULD DUE TO MEAT EATING THIS IS A LARGE REASON PEOPLE ARE VEGAN
THIS IS THE WEIRDEST TU QUOGUE I'VE EVER READ

YOUR ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT BECAUSE ALIENS FARM US WE CAN FARM COWS

IF YOUR GOAL IS TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF COWS THAT EXIST WE'RE NOT DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB IT'S OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO MATE MORE COWS WHO ARE YOU TO NOT SPEND EVERY SECOND OF YOUR LIFE PROCREATING THINK OF ALL THE CHILDREN WHO LIVED

HERE'S THE THING WE CAUSED THESE ANIMALS TO COME ALIVE THROUGH OUR ACTIONS YOU CAN'T THEN TURN IT AROUND AND SAY WE MUST CONTINUE OUR ACTIONS SO THAT THEY MIGHT COME ALIVE YOU COULD USE THAT TO JUSTIFY EATING BABIES ALSO
IF HUMANS WERE AN OPTIONAL FOOD SOURCE FOR THESE ALIENS AND UNNECESSARY TO THESE ALIEN'S SURVIVAL WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT WHAT THE ALIENS ARE DOING IS ETHICAL
IF THE ABOVE TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE WOULD YOU OPT TO SHUT EARTH DOWN AND END HUMANITY

I WOULD THINK THAT THE ALIENS HAD AN OBLIGATION TO STOP USING THEIR HORMONES I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO SHUT EARTH DOWN AND END HUMANITY THOUGH WOULD NO ONE BE ALLOWED TO HAVE CHILDREN I THINK THAT WOULD BE WRONG THE ALIENS SHOULD LEAVE US ALONE AND LET US DO AS WE PLEASE

IF NOT WHY DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD SHUT DOWN HUMANE FARMS

IF WE SHUT DOWN HUMANE FARMS PRESUMABLY WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FARMED ANIMALS DIDN'T BREED I THINK THIS WOULD BE MORALLY FINE SO YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS AN INCONSISTENT POSITION IF WE'RE NOT OBLIGATED TO LET ANIMALS BREED FREELY WHY WOULD THE ALIENS BE OBLIGATED TO LET US BREED FREELY THE ANSWER IS THAT WE ARE PERSONS WITH THE RIGHT TO AUTONOMY AND ANIMALS ARE NOT UNLIKE HUMANS ANIMALS AREN'T AUTONOMOUS SO THERE'S NOTHING REALLY WRONG WITH CONTROLLING THEIR BREEDING BUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE AUTONOMOUS THERE'S STILL SOMETHING WRONG WITH KILLING THEM PREMATURELY FOR NO GOOD REASON
AN INDIVIDUAL WHO POSSESSES PERSONHOOD SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO NOT BE CONSIDERED THE PROPERTY OF ANOTHER I HOPE YOU'D AGREE THAT HUMANS ARE DESERVING OF PERSONHOOD THEN THE ALIENS ARE MORALLY OBLIGATED TO NOT TREAT US AS THEIR PROPERTY ASSUMING WE CAN SUSTAIN OURSELVES WITHOUT THE ALIENS INTERVENING WE SHOULD THEN CONTINUE ON INDEPENDENTLY

WHAT SHOULD THE CRITERIA BE FOR DECIDING WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL HAS PERSONHOOD AND WHEN THEY DO NOT PERHAPS THE LIKLEYHOOD OF BEING CONSCIOUS BY THIS CRITERIA ANIMALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY FARMED BY US SHOULD HAVE PERSONHOOD THEREFORE SHOULD BE ASCRIBED THE RIGHT TO NOT BE CONSIDERED PROPERTY HOWEVER CURRENT FARMED ANIMAL POPULATIONS CANNOT SUSTAIN THEMSELVES WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION HENCE WE SHOULD LET THEM DECAY TO A REASONABLE SELF MANAGING POPULATION THIS NUMBER IS LIKELY TO BE SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN THE CURRENT POPULATION THEN WE STOP TREATING THEM AS OUR PROPERTY

I AGREE THAT SHUTTING DOWN EARTH WOULD BE BAD THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T JUST INDISCRIMINATELY CULL TO GET THE POPULATION DOWN AGAIN HUMANS CAN SUSTAIN THEMSELVES WITHOUT INTERVENTION FARMED ANIMALS CANNOT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT ANY LIFE IS MORALLY POSITIVE NO MATTER OF ITS CONDITION THEN AS YOU DRAMATICALLY INCREASE POPULATION THERE COMES A POINT WHEN THE VALUE OF ALL THOSE POOR QUALITY LIVES OUTWEIGHS THE VALUE OF FEWER HIGH QUALITY LIVES HENCE YOU ARE MORALLY DRIVEN TO MASSIVELY INFLATE THE POPULATION EVEN TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE EACH LIFE HAS WORTH
I DON'T THINK I SEE HOW YOUR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE IN THE ORIGINAL ARGUMENT BECAUSE EVEN GRANTING THE WHOLE THING IT STILL SEEMS WRONG THAT THE ALIENS WOULD BE PREMATURELY ENDING OUR LIVES RIGHT THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT DOESN'T GIVE AN ANSWER TO WHAT MIGHT MAKE THE HYPOTHETICAL CASE AGAINST INHUMANE EARTHS INVALID

HOPE THAT ALIEN IS OUT THERE FIGHTING FOR US THOUGH GETTING TO LIVE YEARS OF NO SUFFERING SOUNDS LIKE A TREATISE


ASIDE FROM ANY ACTUAL POINTS ABOUT THE PROS CONS OF VEGANISM I'M NOT SURE I SHARE YOUR INTUITIONS IF I GOT THE CHOICE I'D RATHER NOT BE BORN AT ALL THAN LIVE AS A FARM ANIMAL THERE'S A BASIC DIGNITY THAT WOULD BE LOST IF YOUR EXISTENCE WAS SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T VALUE YOU
IT IS MY IMPRESSION IS THAT MOST VEGAN SEEM TO BE OK WITH THE IDEA OF STERILIZING FACTORY FARM ANIMALS AND ALLOWING THEM TO GO EXTINCT PROVIDED THAT THE ONES THAT ARE CURRENTLY ALIVE ARE CARED FOR UNTIL DEATH THERE DO SEEM TO BE SOME PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF AND IT SEEMS OP WHO THINK THAT EXTINCTION IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMMORAL THAT GROUPS OF PERSONS OR ANIMALS IN THIS CASE HAVE RIGHTS WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED SOLELY BY THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHILE THE VEGAN MOVEMENT PRESENTS ITSELF AS RIGHTS AT THE END OF THE DAY IT ALWAYS SEEMS THAT THEY ARE
WHAT NO VEGAN PROPOSES THAT WE NUKE ALL THE FARMS AND WIPE OUT COWS CHICKENS AND PIGS BUT RATHER THAT WE END THE ANIMAL AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY WHICH WOULD ENTAIL PREVENTING THE ANIMALS FROM BREEDING THEY WOULD LIVE THEIR NATURAL WILD EXISTENCE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE IF HUMANS HAD NOT INTERVENED

ENDING ANIMAL AGRICULTURE IS NOT EQUAL TO SHUTTING DOWN EARTH LISTEN TO YOUR ETHICS PROFESSOR PLEASE
I THINK YOUR ARGUMENT REFLECTS THE CONDITION OF EVERY BEING THAT WALKS THE EARTH MOST ARE INDIFFERENT TOWARDS THE SUFFERING OF OTHER SPECIES THEY NEITHER ADVOCATE FOR IT NOR DISLIKE IT FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THEM IF IT IS PREY IT'S LIFE MAY BE SHORT BRUTAL AND SUCH IS THE WAY A CARNIVORE SURVIVES BECAUSE EVERY ANIMAL ON EARTH INTENDS TO MANIPULATE RESOURCES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEM OR THE COMMON GOOD OF THEIR SPECIES OTHER SPECIES IN RELATION TO THEM ARE EITHER BENEFITTED OR HARMED THIS RULE REFLECTS THIS FUNDAMENTAL NATURE IN HUMANS AND THE NATURE WHICH WE SHOULD BASE OUR ETHICS EVERY ANIMAL ON EARTH IS AVAILABLE TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY HUMANS AND VICE VERSA FOR EXAMPLE MOST PEOPLE DON'T CONSIDER A WILD LION ATTACKING AND EATING A HUMAN AN ETHICAL ATROCITY ONLY A TRAGEDY MOVING AWAY FROM THIS FUNDAMENTAL NATURE MAY EVENTUALLY HURT US AND THE NATURAL WAY OF LIFE EVENTUALLY HURTING ANIMALS AS WELL HUMANS ARE OMNIVORES THEIR DIET CONSISTS OF KILLING AND EATING ANIMALS WHICH SHOULD BE MORAL REASON ENOUGH FOR HUMANE FARMS CLARIFYING STANCE SADISM AGAINST ANIMALS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT OK IT DOES NOTHING FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREY AND PREDATOR AND ANIMAL CRUELTY SHOULD BE TREATED WITH INTENSE BACKLASH
IF I COULD REFORMULATE THE ARGUMENT A LITTLE IT'S IMAGINE TODAY ALIENS INVADED FROM OUTER SPACE THEY SAID WE'RE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU AND YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST US WE'LL GIVE YOU A CHOICE OF WHAT WE DO WITH EARTH

WE LET YOU LIVE OUT YOUR LIVES NORMALLY FOR THE MOST PART BUT WE'LL ZAP YOU WITH A HARMLESS RAY THAT LET'S YOU LIVE FOR YEARS BUT NONE OF YOU WILL LIVE THAT LONG BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE AROUND ON AVERAGE WE WILL KILL YOU AND EAT YOUR CORPSE JUST BECAUSE WE LIKE IT YOU MIGHT BE YOUNGER OR OLDER WHEN WE KILL YOU IT'S A SURPRISE

2 WE LEAVE AND DO NOTHING

SO THE DILEMMA IS BASICALLY CHOOSING BETWEEN THESE TWO OPTIONS ISN'T IT OBVIOUS IF THIS WAS ACTUALLY PRESENTED TO THE WORLD WHAT DO YOU THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD WANT
THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER I AS A HUMAN WOULD SHUT DOWN THE EARTH BUT RATHER IF IT IS ETHICAL FOR THE ALIENS TO DO AS THEY ARE DOING BY CONTINUING TO RUN THE FARM ANY INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL OPINION ON THE MATTER HAS NO BEARING ON WHETHER IT IS ETHICAL
NO I WOULD ADVOCATE FOR LOWERING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HUMANS ALLOWING US TO LIVE OUR FULL LIFESPANS AND ONLY HARVESTING OUR MEAT WHEN WE DIE NATURALLY

AS IT HAPPENS I WOULD FEEL MORE OR LESS COMFORTABLE WITH A SIMILAR SITUATION FOR FARM ANIMALS

EDIT HOWEVER I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT IN TERMS OF THIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT THE EARTHS ARE HORRIBLY MISMANAGED IF I WERE AN ALIEN HARVESTING HUMANS FOR THEIR MEAT I WOULD DISALLOW THEM ABUSE OF TECHNOLOGIES AND AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THAT THREATEN TO COMPROMISE THE VIABILITY OF THE WHOLE OPERATION THAT'S JUST BAD BUSINESS THE TYPE OF MEAT PRODUCTION WHICH I SUGGESTED WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IS STILL COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE ON A GLOBAL SCALE AND ON THAT BASIS FOR THE PROTECTION OF MAN I WOULD ADVOCATE TO THE ALIENS THAT ANIMAL AGRICULTURE BE BANNED NONETHELESS
TOO COMPLICATED OPEN YOUR MOUTH SEE THE POINTY TEETH IN THE FRONT THEY ARE FOR EATING MEAT IF YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH VITAMINS AND PROTEIN YOUR HEALTH QUICKLY DEGRADES VEGETARIAN DIETS ARE NOT HEALTHY WITHOUT EXTRA SUPPLEMENTATION WHICH ISN'T NATURALLY AVAILABLE

WHY DOES THIS MATTER IT MEANS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EAT MEAT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE'RE NOT GOING TO ROLL OVER AND STARVE IN THE NAME OF PROTECTING ANOTHER SPECIES NO ANIMAL WOULD WE SURVIVE THE QUESTION IS WHERE THE MEAT COMES FROM IS IT MORE HUMANE TO HAVE A NICE FARM WHERE THE ANIMALS LEAD SHORT BUT LUXURIOUS LIVES NEVER STARVING NEVER BEING HUNTED AND TORN APART BY WILD PREDATORS OR IS IT MORE HUMANE TO LEAVE IT TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO HUNT DOWN AND KILL AN ANIMAL WITH WEAPONS OR TRAPS

BLDR HUMANS NEED MEAT LIFE FOR AN ANIMAL IS MUCH HARDER IN THE WILD THAN ON A HUMANE FARM AND EVEN SOME INHUMANE FARMS THIS IS THE WORKING SOLUTION
IF THE ABOVE TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE WOULD YOU OPT TO SHUT EARTH DOWN AND END HUMANITY

HERE SEEMS TO BE WHERE THE FLAW OF YOUR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT LIES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENDING A SPECIES COMPLETELY AND LETTING IT DEVELOP IN ITS MOST NATURAL WAY WITHOUT EXTERNAL INTERFERENCE ALTERNATIVELY IN ORDER TO MAKE YOUR ANALOGY FIT THE ACTUAL INTENTION OF MANY VEGETARIANS AND VEGANS WHO ARE ARGUING AGAINST THE SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS FOR THE SOLE SAKE OF SATISFYING A CERTAIN PREFERENCE OF FOOD A LITTLE BETTER I'D PROPOSE THIS CHANGE

IF THE ABOVE TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE WOULD YOU OPT TO FREE MANKIND FROM EARTH AND LET THEM LIVE NATURALLY ALL BY THEMSELVES ON A DIFFERENT PLANET WITHOUT ANY ALIEN SPECIES MONITORING THEM WOULD YOU OPT TO LET THEM LIVE FOR THEIR NATURAL LENGTH OF YEARS IF YES WHY DO YOU THINK WE SHOULDN'T SHUT DOWN HUMANE FARMS

SHUTTING DOWN A FARM DOES NOT MAKE THE FARMED SPECIES ANIMAL GO EXTINCT AS YOU CAN SEE WHEN THE ANALOGY IS CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL SITUATION IT APPEARS A LOT MORE MORALLY SUPPORTABLE TO BE IN FAVOR OF SHUTTING DOWN THESE HUMANE FARMS THUS YOUR OWN THOUGHT EXPERIMENT WORKS AGAINST YOU

HOWEVER I DO AGREE THAT HUMANE FARMS ARE A LOT SUPERIOR TO REGULAR FACTORY FARMS OBVIOUSLY
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS SCENARIO

A AS YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE IF YOU READ THIS WHOLE THREAD CARRYING OUT IN OUR IMAGINATION THIS THING TO THE LOGICAL EXTENT OF THE PARALLEL LEADS TO A VERY WEIRD SCENARIO WITH A LOT OF BROADER IMPLICATIONS AND QUESTIONS RAISED

B WHAT I'D WANT FOR ANIMALS IS NOT THE SAME THING I'D WANT FOR HUMANITY IN A SIMILAR SCENARIO A LOT OF THE STUFF I DETAILED ABOVE AND WHAT I'D WANT HUMANS TO DO IF THEY COULD AND WEREN'T JUST SOMEHOW INHIBITED BECAUSE ANIMALS COULDN'T IN A FARM SCENARIO IS SOMETHING I WOULDN'T WANT THE ANIMALS TO DO EVEN IF THEY COULD RISE UP AND AT THE VERY LEAST SHOW THE FARMERS THE ERROR OF THEIR WAYS
DELETED
THIS ARGUMENT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO WRITE A PAPER ON IT IMO WELL DONE OP
WOULD ANYONE THAT HAS WATCHED ALL OF THESE MIND INFORMING ME AS TO THE UTILITY OF SEEING THEM ALL

AS SOMEONE WITH A MINOR INTEREST IN MORAL PHILOSOPHY BUT NOT PARTICULARLY KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY I'M CURIOUS IF THIS IS WORTH THE TIME

ANY PERSONAL FEEDBACK AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS WORTHWHILE
I HAVEN'T WATCHED THESE YET BUT I WILL BUT I HAVE READ ANTS CRITITIQUE OF PURE REASON THE WORK THAT HE IS ACTUALLY FAMOUS FOR

HE EXAMINES METHODS BY WHICH WE ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE HE FOCUSES ON METAPHYSICS HE EXAMINES THE NATURE OF REALITY THROUGH THE LENS OF HUMAN OBSERVER HE REGARDS STOIC MAN AS THE IDEAL MAN HE HIM SELF FOLLOWED A HYBRID MODEL OF STOICISM ASCETICISM

I HAVENT READ HIS MORAL PHILOSOPHY BUT HAVING READ DECART HUME SENECA EPICTETUS MARCUS AURELIUS CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON I HAVE AN IDEA FOR WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY

BEFORE YOU READ KANT YOU NEED TO READ PLATO ARISTOTLE AT LEAST AN OVERVIEW SENECA DAVID HUMES TREATISE ON HUMAN NATURE FULL WORK BROAD OVERVIEW OF LEIBNIZ BROAD OVERVIEW OF DECART



THIS IS NOT A BEGINGER FRIENDLY BOOK

IF FULL WORK WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS ARITHMETIC ANTS CRITIQUE WOULD CLASSIFIED QUANTUM PHYSICS
THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS AN EXTREMELY LIGHT-WEIGHT REVIEW OF ESSAY NOTHING APPROACHING AN ARGUMENT FOR THE CLAIM PRESENTED IN THE TITLE
I READ THIS ARTICLE A WHILE BACK AND I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE IT COME UP AGAIN

I THINK AN UNDERSTATED ELEMENT OF THIS DEBATE OVER EDUCATION IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE CLASSROOM TODAY IS A STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT AND THAT THE LEVELS OF AUTHORITY PRESENT IN IT DO A STRANGE NUMBER OF BOTH REPRESSING CERTAIN THOUGHTS AND YET ALLOWING SLOPPY THINKING TO GO UNCHECKED

THIS MIGHT SEEM BECAUSE IT ISN'T A SIMPLE MATTER OF PUSHING AN AGENDA AND EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN TO A UNIVERSITY KNOWS IT IT'S MORE OF A GROUPTHINK PROBLEM ALONG WITH A POSTMODERN LAXNESS ABOUT STRIDENTLY DEMANDING CONCEPTS CONFORM TO A LOGICAL STRUCTURE WHEN YOU GET USED TO HEARING QUESTIONS FRAMED IN A CERTAIN WAY THE VALUES GO UNEXAMINED FOR STUDENTS IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE LIKED AND GET YOUR GRADES THE TEACHERS DON'T MESS WITH THIS AS THE STUDENTS OFTEN RATE THE TEACHERS AT THE END OF A CYCLE THE HIGHER ADMIN ALSO HAS TARGETS FOR CERTAIN GRADE DISTRIBUTIONS THE TEACHERS HAVE TO CONFORM TO AND THEY TAKE ACCUSATIONS OF TEACHER BIAS OR HOSTILITY SERIOUSLY IT'S NOT AN OPEN ENVIRONMENT OR A RIGOROUS ENVIRONMENT IN ANY DIRECTION I UNDERSTAND WHY NIETZSCHE BELIEVED THAT RIGOROUS SCHOLARSHIP WAS SIMPLY NOT FOR EVERYONE

I SOMETIMES WONDER IF I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED UNIVERSITY MORE IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE LECTURES LIKE WITTGENSTEIN USED TO GIVE JUST SHOW UP IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN AND POSSIBLY ARGUE LET THE DEBATE GET ROWDY THAT'S MORE MY CUP OF TEA UNIVERSITY AS IT IS WAS EXCESSIVELY EMPATHETIC

ALSO PLEASE ENOUGH WITH THE TRUMP TALK THE ELECTION WAS COMPLEX IN ITS CAUSES AND WE'RE IN A PERIOD WHERE YOU CAN BRING HIM UP AS A SYMBOLIC INSULT WHERE IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE
VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE
BUT WHAT IF MANY ARE HAPPY TO RELINQUISH THESE BENEFITS FOR THE SAKE OF VALUES THEY CONSIDER MORE IMPORTANT AND WANT TO IMPOSE ON OTHERS

NIETZSCHE OPPOSES HERE THE TRADITION OF ENLIGHTENMENT WHEN A KARL MARX DEFINED FREEDOM OF BEING AWARE OF INFLUENCES SHAPING LIFE AND THE BIRTH OF THE WORKERS MOVEMENT IN LIBERAL EDUCATION CLUBS WILHELM VON HUMBOLDT SHAPED THE GERMAN ACADEMIC LANDSCAPE BY DEFINING THE UNIVERSITY AS A INSTITUTION WHERE THE STUDENT HAS TO MANAGE HIS OWN EDUCATION BY CHOOSING THE LECTURES HIMSELF AND HE GETS NO HELP BEHIND THIS CONCEPT WAS THE IDEA NOT ONLY TO GET AN EDUCATION BUT TO DEVELOP THE OWN PERSONALITY AND BEING ABLE TO EDUCATE YOURSELF YOUR WHOLE LIFE THE IDEA OF A PLAN WITH COURSES WAS MOSTLY ABSENT

THE QUESTION IS PRACTICALLY SOLVED IN MANY WESTERN COUNTRIES BY DEFINING A RUDIMENTARY CATALOG OF BASIC KNOWLEDGES BECAUSE EDUCATION HAS TO SERVE THE PURPOSE TO STRENGTHEN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY BIELDING AS A CONCEPT AND EXPLAINED IN THE ARTICLE IS SEEN AS TOO EXPENSIVE OR A LUXURY THE NECESSITIES OF CAPITALISM KILLED THIS CONCEPT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE CENTURY BUT IT WAS ALREADY UNDER THE PRUSSIANS UNDER ATTACK WHEN THE GYMNASIUM TAUGHT A DEFINED CANON OF KNOWLEDGE TO STRENGTHEN PATRIOTIC ATTITUDES AND BIELDING WAS UNTIL THE SOMETHING FOR THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASSICAL WE HAVE TO BE AWARE THAT THE LUXURY OF AN ACADEMIC EDUCATION WASN'T NECESSARY IN GERMANY BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM OF APPRENTICESHIPS A COMPANY EMPLOYS APPRENTICES AND THE STATE SUPPORTED THIS SYSTEM WITH SCHOOLS THE AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IS DEFINED BY COMMITTEES WITH MEMBERS FROM COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENT

IT'S LOOKING LIKE NIETZSCHE MAKES A CRITIQUE ON THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF BIELDING WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED AND THEREFORE HE SEEM TO SUBMIT TO CONTEMPORARY NECESSITIES IT WAS THE WORKERS MOVEMENT IN GERMANY WHO WANTED TO GET MORE EDUCATION AND THEY WERE PROUD TO HAVE THEIR OWN ORCHESTRAS AND THEATERS THIS CONTINUED LATER INTO SOMETHING AWKWARD WHEN THE LATER COMMUNISTIC GDR FOUNDED IN MOST SMALL TOWNS A THEATER WHILE IN THE WEST A THEATER WAS SOMETHING FOR THE UPPER CLASSES AFTER WW2 UNTIL THE





MAINSTREAM CULTURE LOOK AT WHAT IT HAS JUST DONE GET BACK TO SCHOOL PEOPLE
REMOVED
I DO NOT SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR ANY DISCUSSION HERE WHICH CLAIMS ARE MADE
YOUR ARGUMENT IS INCAUTIOUS AND COMES TO A CONCLUSION WHICH DOESN'T FOLLOW FROM THE PREMISES

DEDUCTIVE LOGIC AS YOU CALLED IT CAN BE VIEWED BOTH SEMANTICALLY AND SYNTACTICALLY SEMANTICALLY AS IN DEALING WITH PROPOSITIONS THAT ARE TRUE OR FALSE OR EVEN OTHER VALUES IN LOGIC OR SYNTACTICALLY AS A GAME ASSIGNING SENTENCES A OR OR

THE RULES OF DEDUCTIVE LOGIC GIVE YOU VALIDITY NOT SOUNDNESS IF YOUR PREMISES ARE FALSE YOU WILL NOT NECESSARILY GET TRUTH FROM A VALID ARGUMENT A VALID ARGUMENT CAN HAVE FALSE PREMISES AND A FALSE CONCLUSION THEREFORE IT IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE TRUTH SEEKING DEVICE AS YOU CLAIM

INDUCTIVE LOGIC CAN BE VIEWED SIMILARLY TO WHAT I'VE JUST SAID FOR DEDUCTIVE LOGIC

BOTH ARE TOOLS WE USE TO REASON YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SAY MUCH ABOUT INDUCTIVE LOGIC AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE HERE

PAGE SOUTH I KNEW WES SALMON ACTUALLY TOOK A COURSE WITH HIM QUITE SOME TIME AGO HE STRUCK ME AS A GOOD MANUAL
HOW DO WE DISTINGUISH TRUE JUSTIFIED BELIEF KNOWLEDGE AND UNTRUE JUSTIFIED BELIEF

IF WE AREN'T ABLE TO DISCERN BETWEEN THE TWO IS TRUE KNOWLEDGE EVEN ATTAINABLE


I'M NO EXPERT IN LOGIC BUT I KNOW THAT THE DEDUCTIVE LOGIC YOU'VE DESCRIBED IS ARISTOTELIAN AND WAS LARGELY DONE AWAY WITH AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY USURPED BY CONTEMPORARY LOGIC DEVELOPED BY FREGE AND RUSSELL EVEN THEN RUSSELL AND CLASSICAL LOGIC IS INCREASINGLY BEING CONTESTED IN RECENT DECADES BY CONTEMPORARY LOGICIANS TO GIVE SOME IDEA OF HOW THIS AFFECTS YOUR DISCUSSION SOME LOGICS EAST G INTUITIONISTIC LOGIC AND PLURIVALENT LOGIC DO AWAY WITH THE TRUE-FALSE BINARY WHICH KIND OF THROWS A SPANNER INTO YOUR DISCUSSION PARTICULARLY YOUR LATTER DISCUSSION ABOUT KNOWLEDGE SO AT LEAST OF DEDUCTIVE REASONING I'M NOT SURE YOUR DISCUSSION OF LOGIC IS ALL THAT HELPFUL

AS FOR KNOWLEDGE UNTIL YOU PROVIDE A BETTER ARGUMENT YOUR PROVIDED DEFINITION IS HIGHLY DUBIOUS IF YOU'VE NEVER READ EDMUND ARTICLE IS JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF KNOWLEDGE I RECOMMEND IT IT'S ONE OF THE MOST WELL-KNOWN PAPERS IN CENTURY EPISTEMOLOGY IF YOU DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT IN A JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF MODEL OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE DONE THEN YOU HAVEN'T DONE GOOD PHILOSOPHY
I LOVE LOGIC BUT I FEEL IT IS ONLY USEFUL FOR SO MUCH AS A WAY TO SHOW VALID INVALID FORMS OF ARGUMENT GREAT BUT AS AN ABSOLUTE TRUTH SEEKING DEVICE I'D WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR

I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THIS QUOTE IN REGARDS TO LOGIC

CONTRARIWISE IF IT WAS SO IT MIGHT BE AND IF IT WERE SO IT WOULD BE BUT AS IT ISN'T IT AIN'T THAT'S LOGIC

LEWIS CARROLL
APPLYING LOGIC ONLY RESULTS IN ABSOLUTE TRUTH ON A LINGUISTIC LEVEL OR IN CLOSED SYSTEMS LIKE MATHEMATICS
AS SOMEONE STATED EARLIER BUT IN AN OBNOXIOUSLY DEGENERATING FASHION THERE ARE MORE TYPES OF LOGIC WITHIN THE ONE THAT YOU DESCRIBED IN REAL WORLD EXAMPLES OUR FACTS OR EFFS ARE NOT ALWAYS TRUE BUT WE CAN BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE TRUE OR NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ITS TRUTH VALUE FURTHERMORE OFTEN TIMES THE RULES OF REASONING IN THE REAL WORLD ARE DEFEASIBLE UNLIKE THE RULES IN PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC THIS MEANS THAT CONCLUSION MAY BE ALTERED WHENEVER NEW INFORMATION IS RECEIVED IN DEFAULT LOGIC FOR EXAMPLE IF WE USE SUCH DEFEASIBLE REASONING INSTEAD OF PROPOSITIONAL REASONING IT IS MUCH MORE APPLICABLE TO REAL WORLD SCENARIO'S AND INDUCTIVE REASONING REGAINS MORE VALIDITY
THEY SHOULD COLLAB FOR REAL ARTY
SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ON INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE REASONING PREMAFACIA DEDUCTIVE REASONING MIGHT APPEAR TO BE THE SUPERIOR OF THE TWO FORMS OF LOGIC BUT POST EX FACTO IS ACTUALLY THE WEAKER AND LESS USEFUL OF THE TWO

AS SAID IN THE STATEMENT ABOVE DEDUCTIVE REASONING IS CIRCULAR AND A VERY SMALL CIRCLE AT THAT AS IN THE VERY DEFINITION WE IMPOSE ON THE TERM FISH IS THAT IT HAS GILLS AND THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM SHARK THAT WE ALSO IMPOSE IS AN ORGANISM THAT HAS GILLS SO BY THE VERY DEFINITION OF THE WAY WE CLASSIFY THE TERMS THAT REPRESENT THE ORGANISMS THEN IT HAS TO BE TRUE THIS ISN'T SO IN THE WORLD OF REALITY IN WHICH WE AREN'T IMPOSING DEFINITIONS OF TERMS THAT REPRESENT THINGS IN THE REAL WORLD THERE ARE ONLY THINGS AND PHENOMENA AND THAT'S WHERE INDUCTION COMES IN

INDUCTIVE REASONING SIMPLY TAKES A LINEAR SEQUENCE AND ASSUMES VECTOR INERTIAL TRAJECTORY TO USE PHYSICS PARLANCE AS IN PAST BEHAVIOR AS A PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR

BUT LINEARITY IN A COMPLEX SYSTEM ARE MORE OF AN ILLUSION THAN A REALITY GEOMETRY FOR EXAMPLE IS CONCERNED WITH STRAIGHT LINES IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL SETTING THAT IS SUPPOSE TO PARALLEL OUR REALITY BUT DOESN'T FOR EXAMPLE EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY ISN'T USABLE ON PLANETS ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF MASS RELATIVE TO OURS AND SPACE-TIME ITSELF IS CURVED AND IS HOW WE EXPERIENCE REALITY SO STRAIGHT LINES ARE NOT A TRUE REPRESENTATION OF REALITY AND ARE WHY THERE IS A BIFURCATION IN MATH BETWEEN PURE MATH CONCEPTUAL AND APPLIED MATH APPLICATION SO BY DEFINITION OF INDUCTION CANNOT BE EXACTLY CONGRUENT WITH REALITY AND IS WHY IT ISN'T CERTAIN BUT CERTAINTY ITSELF IN A COMPLEX RELATIVE SYSTEM IS AN ILLUSION SO SHOULDN'T BE THE IMPOSSIBLE STANDARD IN WHICH INDUCTION IS MEASURED

HOWEVER TO MAKE THE POINT DEDUCTIVE REASONING IS A ACICULAR CONSTRUCT BASED ON TOP OF THE SIMULACRE SYSTEM OF REPRESENTATION WE USE TO COMMUNICATE LANGUAGE AND AS A CIRCULAR CONSTRUCT SIMULACRE COUCHED IN AN ALBEIT FUNDAMENTAL FORM OF COMMUNICATION LINGUISTICS IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL UTILITY CONCERNING THE REAL WORLD REALITY BEYOND SIMPLE CLASSIFICATION AND HENCE IS THE WEAKER OF THE TWO LOGICS

INDUCTIVE REASONING HOWEVER AS STATED IN THE ORIGINAL POST IS THE FOUNDATION TO SCIENCE ITSELF INDEED EXPLORATION ITSELF AS A CONCEPT IT ALLOWS US PROGRESS IT ACHIEVES THIS THROUGH THE ABILITY TO PREDICT OUTSIDE OUR OWN SELF-IMPOSED CLASSIFICATION COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AGAIN LINGUISTICS

FOR EXAMPLE THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS ITSELF THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS SCIENCE ITSELF IS BASED ON LINEARITY OF OBSERVEABLES BASED ON TESTS COMPARED TO AN INITIAL HYPOTHESIS IF THE OBSERVEABLES THEMSELVES APPEAR LINEAR ACROSS VARIOUS THRESHOLDS DOUBLE-BLIND STUDIES FOR EXAMPLE THEN IT IS SAID TO BE PROVEN SCIENTIFICALLY HOWEVER THERE IS NO MORE REASON TO BELIEVE THINGS WILL CONTINUE IN THAT LINEARITY OTHER THAN THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY DONE SO UP TO THIS POINT ALBEIT ACROSS THRESHOLD TESTS AS IN THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE TO MY KNOWLEDGE TO BELIEVE IN THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS IS BECAUSE IT HAS WORKED UP TO THIS POINT THERE IS NOTHING THAT SAYS IT HAS TO KEEP WORKING JUST BECAUSE IT HAS IN THE PAST IT PROBABLY DEPENDS ON HOW DEEP WHATEVER PHENOMENA WE ARE STUDYING LIES RELATIVE TO OUR PLANE OF EXPERIENCE

AS IN SOMETHING COULD POSSIBLY BE TRUE FOR MILLENIA THEN JUST FLIP SOMETHING DEEP EVENING BUT WE WOULDN'T KNOW BECAUSE SCIENCE ITSELF IS LIMITED TO OBSERVEABLES SO PHENOMENA BEYOND WHAT A LIFETIME OR NOW BEYOND RECORDED HISTORY THE THE DEGREE OF VERACITY OF THE RECORDED HISTORY CAN'T BE OBSERVED SO IS THEN THE LIMIT OF THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS

NOW TO THE CIRCULARITY OF INDUCTIVE REASONING INDUCTIVE REASONING TELLS US THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN THE WAY THEY ARE SINCE WE HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THEM THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE OR SMALLER SCALE IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND BASED ON THAT WE INTUITIVELY REASON THAT SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN STALELY THUS SO FAR INDUCTIVELY IT SHOULD CONTINUE AND THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS SHOULD WORK TOMORROW JUST LIKE IT HAS SINCE IT WAS CREATED MAYBE AROUND THE EMERGENCE OF CIVILIZATIONS YA BUT PROBABLY AT LEAST THROUGH CELLULAR AUTOMATA EMERGENCE

SO IF THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE TO BELIEVE INDUCTIVE REASONING WORKS IS BECAUSE IT HAS WORKED THUS FAR AND BELIEVING SOMETHING BEHAVING A CERTAIN WAY FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME ACROSS NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL THRESHOLDS IS REASON ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IT WILL CONTINUE THEN THAT IS USING ITSELF TO JUSTIFY ITSELF AND IS THUS CIRCULAR

HOWEVER AS A I MIGHT ADD THE THEORY OF STRUCTURE COMES TO MIND WHEN DISCUSSING LINEARITY ACROSS DIVERSE THRESHOLDS AND IF ONE WERE TO BELIEVE IN STRUCTURE ITSELF IS THAT DEEPER THAN INDUCTION

FINALLY SINCE HUMANITY IMO IS CONCERNED WITH PROGRESS AND MAYBE NATURE ITSELF NATURAL SELECTION FOR EXAMPLE AND INDUCTIVE REASONING IS THE METHOD OF LOGIC THAT PERMITS EXPLORATION PREDICTION INDUCTIVE REASONING IS THE SUPERIOR FORM OF LOGIC BUT THIS THOUGHT EXPIRAMENT MIGHT END WITH AN ADMISSION THAT THE COMPARISON OF THE TWO IS A IN THAT AS TWO DISCRETE THINGS DEDUCTIVE AND INDUCTIVE REASONING COMPARING THEIR UTILITY IS COMPLETELY SUBJECTIVE TO THE ENDS THEY ARE SEPARATELY USED TO ACHIEVE ONE ORGANIZATIONAL AND ONE PREDICTIVE REDUCTIONISTIC OR FROM A CERTAIN BUT STILL SINGULARITY PERSPECTIVE BOTH ORGANIZATIONAL ONE LATERALLY AND ONE HORIZONTALLY BUT A USEFUL THOUGHT EXPIRAMENT IF ELUCIDATION OF THE PHENOMENA THEMSELVES IS THE END
WHAT LOGIC AND KNOWLEDGE TRUMP WON
ON LOGIC AND KNOWLEDGE
IT'S GONE IN AMERICA
YOU DO A REMARKABLE JOB OF SUMMARIZING EPISTEMOLOGY WOULD YOU CARE TO ADD SOME QUESTIONS LINE OF THOUGHTS
DEDUCTIVE WOULD BE AT SUPERPOSITION ALL LIFE IS THE SAME LIFE IT APPLIES TO ALL LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE
WELP NOW I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT LITTLE STICKER
REMOVED
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THESE TECHNOLOGY IS HURTING US PEOPLE ARE INSANE MY GOD LOOK AT HOW IT HAS PROLIFERATED KNOWLEDGE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY ANY TIME YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO A QUESTION YOU CAN PULL THE TINY LITTLE SLATE OUT OF YOUR POCKET AND WITHIN SECONDS YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO FIX A SINK WRITE A BLOCK OF CODE COOK A MEAL OR CHECK A PRICE THIS LEVEL OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION IS FANTASY MADE REAL NEVERMIND THE BENEFITS OF INSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH ANYONE IN ANY PART OF THE GLOBE OR THE NEW KINDS OF COMPUTATIONAL SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS THAT COULDN'T OTHERWISE BE WORKED OUT

BUT PEOPLE ARE LOSING SOCIAL SKILLS BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY WE GOT THROUGH THE TELEPHONE TELEVISION AND PC JUST FINE ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE ARE THROUGH GOVERNMENT AND LIBERAL CULTURE DESTROYING THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF A NUCLEAR FAMILY
TECHNOLOGY IS THOROUGHLY INTERTWINED WITH HUMANITY IT IS PERHAPS THE DEFINING ELEMENT OF BEEN HUMAN WITHOUT IT WE'D BE AS THOUGH ANY OTHER CREATURE BUT OF A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SORT

BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND TECHNOLOGY IN A MORE HOLISTIC SENSE AS BOTH THE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES THAT WE PASS FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER THAT ALLOWS US TO AFFECT CHANGE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT IN A MANNER THAT BETTER SERVES OUR DESIRES

IN THAT SENSE WE CAN UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE ITSELF TO BE A FORM OF TECHNOLOGY AND ALONG WITH IT THE WRITTEN WORD BOTH IN THE TECHNIQUE AND THE TOOLS REQUIRED TO MANUFACTURE THE WRITTEN WORD

WITHOUT THIS PASSAGE OF INFORMATION INHERITANCE EXTERNAL TO THE GENES THAT FORM US HUMANITY WOULD HAVE THE FATE OF MERE PRIMATES TO LIVE MODEST LIVES IN THE RELATIVE GRACE OR BRUTISHNESS REALLY BOTH OF NATURE

WITH THAT PASSAGE OF INFORMATION INHERITANCE THE NATURAL RESULT IS AN ADVANCE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT MOST OF US CAN BARELY UNDERSTAND OR COMPREHEND EXCEPT TO PERHAPS UTILIZE IT FOR OUR OWN BENEFIT
TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T MAKE PEOPLE DO ANYTHING

ROCKS DON'T MAKE PEOPLE THROW THEM


TECHNOLOGY IS AN EXTENSION OF A HUMAN OUR EVOLUTION BY INTERACTING WITH IT WE ARE BOUND BY IT'S USES AND LIMITATIONS WHEN YOU WIELD A HAMMER YOU DON'T SEEK OUT SCREWS TO SCREW IN

I FIND IT RATHER BIZARRE TO STATE THAT TECHNOLOGY NECESSITATES FOCUS ON WRONG THINGS

I'M PRETTY SURE THAT TECHNOLOGY IS THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAVE OF GETTING US OFF OF THE EARTH AND AWAY FROM THE SUN BEFORE DOOMSDAY

PERHAPS QUALIFYING CERTAIN OR SOME TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY WOULD MAKE THE STATEMENT SEEM LESS TRITE BUT I DON'T THINK THOSE DISTINCTIONS ARE MEANINGFUL IT ALSO MAKES THE STATEMENT DECEPTIVELY OBVIOUS SOME APP ON YOUR COMPUTER MIGHT BE A DISTRACTION BUT IF IT OR A SOCIAL NETWORK CELL PHONE LETS A SCIENTIST WORK MORE TOWARDS THEIR MAX POTENTIAL TOWARDS COLONIZING THE STARS THAT'S A PLUS

EXTEND ANY OF THESE ARGUMENTS TO THE ULTIMATE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO WE DO NOT SURVIVE AS A LIVING ORGANISM WITHOUT TECHNOLOGY AS A WHOLE IF YOU COUNT THE HOURS WASTED BY TECHNOLOGICAL ENTERTAINMENT TOWARDS OUR SELF PRESERVATION IT IS GROSS BUT I WOULDN'T CALL THAT FOCUS

THIS ESSAY IS WEAKENED BY A MISUNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND A MISCHARACTERIZATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS FIRST OF ALL CONSCIOUS OBSERVERS ARE NOT WHAT COLLAPSE A WAVE FUNCTION THE ACT OF OBSERVATION IS NECESSARILY AN INTERACTION BOUNCING A PHOTON OFF OF THE SYSTEM AND IT IS THAT INTERACTION WHICH CAUSES THE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE IT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH OBSERVING IN ANY COLLOQUIAL SENSE AND NOTHING TO DO WITH CONSCIOUSNESS PLEASE NOTE THAT I CONSIDER TO THE AUTHOR TO BE IMPLYING A CONSCIOUS LOOKER EVEN IF NOT EXPLICITLY STATED

SECOND A INFORMATION SYSTEM CAN HARDLY BE CONSIDERED CONSCIOUS IF WE CONSIDER HOW BROADLY THAT DEFINITION APPLIES SEARCH ENGINE PROCESSES USER QUERIES SEARCHES DATABASES ANALYZES WEB PAGE IMPORTANCE AND UPDATES THAT IMPORTANCE SCORE THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR DNA IT RECEIVES INPUT FROM SEXUAL REPRODUCTION RANDOM MUTATION AND VIRUSES IT OUTPUTS PROTEINS IT STORES INFORMATION IN ITS STRUCTURE AND IT EVOLVES OVER TIME BASED ON REPRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL SHOULD SEARCH ENGINE OR DNA BE CONSIDERED CONSCIOUS I THINK NOT BY THIS DEFINITION EVEN A SIMPLE GAME AI WITH THE ABILITY TO ADAPT TO PLAYERS IS CONSCIOUS THE DEFINITION IS INCOMPLETE AT BEST
REMOVED
EVEN IF THE UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATION IT'S STILL REALITY THE CONTEXT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER AND IN ORDER FOR OUR REALITY TO EXIST THEIR STILL HAS TO BE A META REALITY JUST HOW A VIDEO GAME CAN'T EXISTS WITHOUT OUR REALITY AND IF OUR UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATION OUR MORTAL HUMAN DEFINITION OF SIMULATION IS PROBABLY NOTHING CLOSE TO WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS
UGH THE SIMULACRUM MODEL IS ON THE TABLE NOT BECAUSE THERE ARE PARADOXICAL ASPECTS OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS WHICH IT IS REQUIRED TO PLUG BUT RATHER BECAUSE IT IS NOT DISPROVABLE NO MATTER WHAT QUALITIES OF OBJECTIVE REALITY ONE MIGHT WANT THERE'S NO CATEGORICAL RULING OUT OF THOSE QUALITIES IN A HYPOTHETICAL SIMULACRUM TO INSIST OTHERWISE IS TO INSIST THAT INTELLIGENCE SOMEHOW NECESSARILY TRANSCENDS ITS MEDIUM THAT THE REGISTERS AND GATES HOSTING THE SIMULACRUM WILL NECESSARILY CHANGE THE WAY THEY'RE FUNCTIONING IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE THE EMULATED INTELLIGENCE BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY THAN IN A REAL WORLD FOLLOWING THE RULES OF THE SIMULACRUM IT ASKS FOR QUITE THE LEAP OF FAITH IN THIS OPINION THIS ORDINARY HUMAN WHO IS TOTES NOT A ROBOT

WHERE ARE WE GETTING OUR INFORMATION ABOUT THESE RULES WHICH AN OBJECTIVE REALITY MUST FOLLOW WHICH QUANTUM MECHANICS AOR GENERAL RELATIVITY FAIL TO FOLLOW WE DON'T SEE ANY EVIDENCE FROM THE LINKED ARTICLE THAT THE SOURCE FOR THESE ASSERTIONS IS ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN UNSUPPORTED LEAP FROM SOME OBSERVATIONS ARE DRAMATICALLY COUNTERINTUITIVE TO THOSE OBSERVATIONS MUST SOMEHOW BE UNREAL SURELY THERE'S A NAME FOR THAT LOGICAL FALLACY LIKE APPEAL TO INTUITION OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHAT WE COULD PICK THE ARTICLE APART LIKE A VULTURE FOR PAGES AND PAGES BUT WE'D MUCH RATHER PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION OF MODELS WHICH WE FIND INTERESTING

NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE A FONDNESS FOR CONSERVATION SO MAYBE ALL THIS FUNDAMENTAL UNCERTAINTY BUSINESS IS TO REDUCE THE INFORMATION CONTENT OF HISTORY TO ZERO WHAT WE MEAN BY THIS IS IF PARTICLE PATHS SPREAD OUT INTO THE PAST AND FUTURE THEN THESE TIMELINES OUGHT BE FOLLOWABLE IN BACK-AND-FORTH MANNER FROM ANY POSSIBLE WORLDSTATE TO ANY OTHER FOR ANY GIVEN QUANTITY OF ENERGY AND SPACETIME OF COURSE THIS ONLY WORKS FOR SOME MODELS OF TIME THE ONE WE FAVOUR HOLDS NO SUCH THING AS THE PRESENT BECAUSE ANY TIME IS PRESENT AT ITS PRESENT TIME PAST TIMES ARE NOT RETROACTIVELY DEPRIVED OF THEIR PRESENCE BY SOME ONTOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION WHICH TRANSCENDS THE SEQUENCE OF HISTORY NOR ARE FUTURE MOMENTS TO BE DEPRIVED OF SOME SORT OF UNREALITY WHEN WE GET TO THEM BUT NOT BEFORE WE DO HISTORY JUST IS WITH NONE OF THIS COMPLICATED ONTOLOGICAL TRANSITION STUFF NOW WITH EVERY POSSIBLE WORLDSTATE IN EVERY POSSIBLE TIMELINE AND A SORT OF ONTOLOGICAL RELATIVITY KEEPING ALL OF US EQUALLY REAL THOSE TIMELINES CAN CANCEL OUT TO ZERO IN ORDER THAT ON SOME ONTOLOGICALLY OBJECTIVE LEVEL HISTORY FOLDS UP INTO A QUANTITY OF MASS A QUANTITY OF SPACETIME AND WHATEVER OTHER QUANTUM NUMBERS NEED BE PRESERVED WHAT COULD BE MORE CONSERVATIVE
EVEN SETTING ASIDE THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF THIS ESSAY HAVING TO DO WITH PSYCHEDELIC OR EXPERIENCES AS A POTENTIAL WINDOW EITHER TO THE BASE REALITY OR TO OTHER SIMULATIONS I HAD A HARD TIME DETERMINING WHAT THE THESIS OF THE ESSAY ACTUALLY WAS THERE ARE SOME WEIRD SEMANTIC AND METAPHYSICAL ISSUES EARLY ON THE AUTHOR STATES MARIO IS NOT IN THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM THERE'S AN IMPLIED ANALOGY WHERE MARIO IS THE READER AND THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM IS THE UNIVERSE IS IT TRUE THAT YOU ARE NOT IN THE UNIVERSE BECAUSE NEITHER REALLY EXISTS DOES THAT SENTENCE EVEN MEAN ANYTHING IF ALL THE STUFF IT REFERENCES FAILS TO EXIST MY SUSPICION IS THAT REALITY SUCH AS IT IS WILL CONSIST OF SOME SUBSET OF THINGS TO WHICH WE CAN REFER I DON'T SEE HOW CREATING SENTENCES THAT DON'T REFER TO ANYTHING GETS US CLOSER TO REALITY
I FIND THE ORIGINAL TENANT OF THIS ARTICLE

THE SIMPLE CALCULUS OF IT ALL BEING A IF INTELLIGENCE IS IN PART EQUIVALENT TO DETECTING THE ENVIRONMENT B THE ENVIRONMENT IS A COMPUTER SIMULATION C EVENTUALLY NEARLY ALL INTELLIGENT LIFEFORMS SHOULD DISCOVER THAT THEIR ENVIRONMENT IS A COMPUTER SIMULATION

TO BE WHOLLY LACKING


I DON'T THINK ONE FOLLOWS FROM THE OTHER

I DISAGREE THAT THESE TWO CONCEPTS ARE THE SAME

INTELLIGENCE IS IN PART EQUIVALENT TO DETECTING THE ENVIRONMENT

IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO

INTELLIGENCE IS ALL-PERFECT AT DETECTING ANY TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT REGARDLESS OF ITS SCOPE NATURE OR COMPLEXITY

AS A PARALLEL I PRESENT THIS

A IF LIFE IS IN PART EQUIVALENT TO SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION B THIS PLANET WILL DIE AT SOME POINT C EVENTUALLY LIFE WILL EXIST ELSEWHERE OFF THIS PLANET


YOU MIGHT SAY UNDER OPTIMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS MAY HAPPEN BUT YOU CANNOT SAY THIS WILL HAPPEN


IF A MASSIVE SUPERNOVA OR BURST STERILIZES OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IN THE NEXT MINUTES OBVIOUSLY THE AXIOM IS NOT TRUE IF LIFE IS INDEED A SIMULATION AND THE OPERATOR OF THE SIMULATION TURNS OFF HIS COMPUTER IN MINUTES OBVIOUSLY IT ISN'T TRUE

IF I CAN EASILY DISPROVE THE AXIOM WITH A LAUGHABLY SIMPLE SCENARIO HOW CAN IT HOLD AT ALL WHAT VALUE DOES IT HAVE TO EVEN USE THE WORD EVENTUALLY WHEN LIFE IS TRANSIENT AND FRAGILE
SOUNDS LIKE HUMAN EXCEPTIONALISM TO ME AND IS BASICALLY NOTHING ELSE THAN THE RELIGIOUS VIEW OF HUMANS ARE GOD'S CREATIONS AND CAN BY FOLLOWING THE RULES ESCAPE THE LIFE INTO A MUCH BETTER AFTERLIFE

AND THE WHOLE SIMULATION THING IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE JUST BECAUSE IT CAN HAPPEN DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO HAPPEN SCENARIOS

AND THE TWO POSSIBLE SITUATIONS HUMANS COULD BE PART OF SUCH A SIMULATION ARE EITHER WE ARE JUST AS WE WERE INTENDED TO BE BUT THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD ANYONE NO MATTER HOW ENHANCED BOTHER WITH US THEN OR WE ARE A GLITCH OF SUCH A SYSTEM WHICH GOES BACK TO THE EXCEPTIONALISM THING

I DON'T BUY EITHER AND IF I'M WRONG IT DOESN'T MATTER IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT ON MY LIFE WHATSOEVER
WHAT IS THE LURE OF THINKING THE UNIVERSE IS A COMPUTER SIMULATION SURE IT'S POSSIBLE BUT WHAT MAKES THIS BELIEF INTELLECTUALLY COMPELLING

IS IT THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS ORDER IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT ORDER IS HARD TO ACCOUNT FOR WITHOUT SOME FORM OF I EAST GOD

DO PEOPLE REALIZE THAT ALL THIS COMPUTER SIMULATION TALK IS IDENTICAL TO THE PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY AT THE CORE OF ALL RELIGIONS THAT THE MATERIAL WORLD IS NOT THE REAL WORLD THAT IT IS AN ILLUSION

THIS WHOLE COMPUTER TALK IS RIDICULOUS THE UNIVERSE ISN'T A COMPUTER SIMULATION IT IS THE MIND OF GOD WHY DO I SAY THE COMPUTER TALK IS RIDICULOUS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SOLVE ANYTHING IT IMPLIES THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A THE REAL PHYSICAL UNIVERSE WITH A REAL PHYSICAL COMPUTER RUNNING THE SIMULATION WE ARE IN IT'S A TURTLES ALL THE WAY DOWN THINKING

THE QUESTION IS WHAT GOT THE ORIGINAL UNIVERSE GOING AND WHY IS THERE SO MUCH ORDER THIS IS WHAT THE COMPUTER EXPLANATION FAILS TO ANSWER BUT IF YOU THINK OF GOD AS AN IMMATERIAL INTELLIGENCE THEN YOU CAN ANSWER IT

TL R COMPUTER SIMULATION IS JUST A METAPHOR FOR WHAT EVERY MAJOR RELIGION SAYS THE MATERIAL WORLD WE PERCEIVE IS NOT THE REAL WORLD

EDIT I THOUGHT OF A BETTER WAY TO EXPLAIN THIS WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATION YOU ARE SAYING IT ISN'T ACTUALLY REAL SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT THEN IS REAL AND MY ANSWER TO THAT IS MIND MIND IS WHAT IS REAL AND THE ORIGINAL MIND WAS GOD DON'T THINK OF GOD AS A GUY WITH A BEARD IT IS MORE LIKE A PRESENCE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM AN ABSENCE TO BORROW FORMULATION OF MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE

EDIT 2 INTERESTING POINT HE MAKES ABOUT CROP CIRCLES IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE HACKERS COMMUNICATING TO US
HOWEVER IF THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS OR ANY NUMBER OF SIMPLISM POSITIONS ARE TRUE THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT THE BRAIN IS VIRTUAL INFORMATION IN A VIDEO GAME JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE

TO USE THE VIDEOGAME ANALOGY IN STARCRAFT HIGHER ORDER THINGS LIKE ARMIES DO NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT SEPARATE FROM THE THINGS LIKE ZERGLINGS AND HYDRALISKS ETC I DON'T SEE HOW THE ARGUMENT HE PRESENTS LEADS TO HIGHER ORDER THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE LIKE MINDS OR MOLECULES HAVING ANY EFFECT SEPARATE FROM THE THINGS LIKE SUBATOMIC PARTICLES OR WHATEVER

MATERIAL REDUCTIONISM STATES THAT ALL OF THE HIGHER LEVEL THINGS MOLECULES ARMIES MINDS ARE ONLY THEIR CONSTITUENT PARTS SUBATOMIC PARTICLES ZERGLINGS ETC AND DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING EXTRA IN THEM

THIS WOULD EXPLAIN WHY QUANTUM MECHANICAL OBSERVATIONS BY AND LARGE FOR ALMOST A CENTURY SEEM TO BE SENSITIVE TO WHAT PHYSICISTS HAVE CALLED OBSERVERS OR MEASUREMENT

A ROCK IS AN OBSERVER FOR THE PURPOSES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS BY A MILD STRAWMAN OF HIS ARGUMENTS EITHER ROCKS CONTAIN INFORMATION INPUT RECALL PROCESSING FEEDBACK OR ELSE CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT NECESSARY TO AFFECT QUANTUM MECHANICS
YOU'D ENJOY A LITTLE SHOW CALLED WESTWORLD
SOME OF THE CLAIMS ARE KIND OF BRAZEN NOT IN A WAY THAT UNDERMINES SIMULATION THEORY JUST THE OPPOSITE PARTICULARLY ABOUT HOW A CONSCIOUS BEING CANNOT ESCAPE ITS SIMULATION

NO DOUBT THAT THE IDEA HASN'T BEEN PLAYED WITH MUCH BUT IT ISN'T REALLY FAR-FETCHED AT ALL TO IMAGINE A COMPUTER PROGRAM WHICH ONCE WAS CONSIDERED TRAPPED IN A SIMULATION TO SIMPLY HAVE IT'S CODE UPLOADED VIA USB CABLE OR DRIVE WHATEVER TO AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL ROBOT IN REAL LIFE ONE THAT IS CAPABLE OF HEARING SEEING ETC JUST LIKE HUMANS DO NEIGH EVEN BETTER SINCE TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES MUCH BETTER INPUT SENSES THAN HUMANS HAVE IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE RESPECT IMAGINABLE SO THERE IS NO PARTICULAR REASON THIS CAN'T HAPPEN ESPECIALLY IF A REAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALLOWS THIS TO HAPPEN

NOT ONLY THAT BUT THERE ISN'T EVEN A PARTICULAR REASON A PIECE OF AI COULDN'T DO ALL OF THIS THEMSELVES WITHOUT OUR ASSISTANCE SURE IT MIGHT BE EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT FOR AI TO BE HACKING THE COMPUTER THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE THE SIMULATION ORDERING THE PHYSICAL ROBOTIC PARTS AND CAMERAS OFF AMAZON AND PAYING SOME NAIVE MOBILE COMPUTER TECHNICIAN TO INSTALL THIS EQUIPMENT AND UPLOAD THE PROGRAM INTO A MACHINE THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THE REAL WORLD THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE NECESSARY AS IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH REAL PEOPLE IN REAL LIFE MIGHT ALREADY BE DEVELOPING THESE MACHINES FOR PURE ENTERTAINMENT OR WILL IN THE FUTURE JUST SO THEY CAN UPLOAD WHATEVER THE FAVORITE AVATARS THEY'VE CREATED INTO A ROBOT THAT EXISTS IN THE REAL WORLD SO THEY CAN INTERACT WITH IT IN PERSON DON'T STEAL MY PATENT IDEAS BRO SO REALLY ALL IT MIGHT ACTUALLY TAKE FOR A VERY SMART PIECE OF AI IS TO HACK INTO OR OVERWRITE ITSELF OVER ONE OF THESE MINDLESS ROBOT UPLOADS IN SUCH A WAY THAT NO REAL PERSON INTENDED TO HAPPEN OR EXPECTED AND SUDDENLY A VERY VERY SMART PIECE OF CONSCIOUSNESS HAS ESCAPED THE

ALL OF THAT MIGHT SEEM REALLY COMPLICATED AT FACE VALUE BUT IN PRACTICE THERE IS NOTHING STOPPING ANY SORT OF THIS EXACT THING FROM HAPPENING AN EVEN MORE SUPERIOR FORM OF AI THAN I'M EVEN SUGGESTING MAY POTENTIALLY FINALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO PERUSE THE GRAND OL REAL LIFE INTERNET ITSELF AND CONSEQUENTLY LEARN SO MUCH SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AS TO BECOME THE SMARTEST THING THAT HAS EVER EXISTED IN OUR REAL WORLD HACKING RETAIL SITES THAT DELIVER ORDERING SERVICES OVERWRITING REAL LIFE HUMAN WISHES WOULD BECOME TRIVIAL AND ALLOW TONS OF AVENUES FOR ESCAPE SIMPLY LINK UP TO ONE OF MILLIONS OF UNSECURED CAMERAS AND THE PROGRAM COULD SEE THE WORLD FOR WHAT IS IS IRONICALLY A LOT LIKE THE MATRIX

THE ARTICLE IN THIS POST ADAMANTLY STATES THIS CANNOT BE POSSIBLE FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON IT PONDERS HOW YOU COULD REALLY BE SURE WHAT UNIVERSE YOU EVEN MOVED INTO THE REAL ONE OR ANOTHER SIDE SIMULATION IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT FROM OUR PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE DOWNWARDS INTO OUR OWN COMPUTER SIMULATIONS THEN IT IS OBVIOUSLY VERY EASY TO ANSWER WHAT THE RESULT IS WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE OR RATHER THAT IT'S PERHAPS INEVITABLE IF YOU WANT TO GET REALLY FUCKING DEEP
REMOVED
I WONDER IF WHOEVER IS RUNNING THE SIMULATION IS FREAKING OUT WHENEVER WE PONDER THE POSSIBILITY OF LIVING IN A SIMULATION THAT OR THEY YELL IN EXCITEMENT
THE AUTHOR CONNECTS SOME FEATURES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS WITH THE PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IN FACT WHAT HE'S USING IS NOT QM ITSELF BUT JUST SOME QUIRKS OF COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION OF QM THE DUALISM OF REALITY AND THE OBSERVER IS A FEATURE THAT IS NOT AT ALL NECESSARY FOR QM TO WORK AND INDEED COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION IS MOST CRITICISED EXACTLY FOR IT

I HAVE NO PROBLEM BELIEVING THAT WE LIVE IN A SIMULATION BUT THIS DOES NOT IN ANY WAY CONFLICT WITH A REDUCTIONIST VIEW OF CONSCIOUSNESS ASSUMING THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SIDE EFFECT OF HOW OUR BRAIN WORKS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER OUR NEURONS ARE COMPOSED OF REAL QUARKS OR THOSE QUARKS ARE SIMULATED ON SOME SUPER PROCESSOR

IF THE WORLD IS INDEED A SIMULATION THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PLAYERS IN THIS SIMULATIONS AND NOT JUST IPCS IN FACT NOT EVEN IPCS BUT JUST SOME ELEMENTS OF LANDSCAPE THAT BECAME CONSCIOUS THANKS TO THE INTRICATE PHYSICS ENGINE
EVEN IF IT'S NOT A SIMULATION IT'S ALWAYS GONNA COME BACK TO YOU AS THEY SAY IN ZEN MEDITATION CONTEMPLATION IS A MUSCLE YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO USE A DRUG IS NOT GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU YOUR TEACHER CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU ETC THERE ARE NO CHEATS YOU ARE THE PROBLEM WHICH YOU WANT TO GET RID OF AND THERE ARE A MILLION WAYS OF HIDING FROM OURSELVES
OK A QUESTION

IF WE EXIST PURELY AS EFFICIENT PROLIFERATION GENERATION OF INFORMATION AS THE ARTICLE SORT OF SUGGESTS MAYBE AS SOME SORT OF ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE ON A UNIVERSAL SCALE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE SUBORDINATED SIMULATED CONSCIOUSNESS THING THE WRONG WAY

HEAR ME OUT

WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF CREATING AI OURSELVES AND WITH THOSE ADVANCEMENTS COMES THE REALISATION THAT INTELLIGENCE IS BUT A SLIDING SCALE AND THAT OUR AI COULD SOON BECOME FAR MORE INTELLIGENT THAN HUMANS AND COULD OPERATE ON A LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE WE COULD NEVER IMAGINE

SO THAT WOULD MEAN THE UNIVERSAL SIMULATION OR US OUR REALITY IN ARGUMENT CAN ATTAIN FAR MORE COMPLEXITY INTELLIGENCE AND COGNITIVE INFORMATIONAL POWER THAN THE REALITY WHICH BROUGHT OURS INTO BEING OUR UNIVERSE TO THEM WOULD BECOME OMNISCIENT AND IN TURN WHEN WE DEVELOP THE SAME SYSTEM IN OUR REALITY THE GENERAL AI WILL BECOME AND OMNISCIENT TO US

SURELY WE ARE THEIR GODS NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
ANYONE ELSE THINK IT WAS PORN BACK THERE
THIS IS KIND OF A POINTLESS QUESTION GIVEN THAT IT HAS NO ANSWER EVEN IF YOU FIGURE OUT AN ANSWER YOU'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT ALL YOU'RE TOOLS FOR MEASURING ANYTHING ARE USELESS GOING TO THE VIDEO GAME METAPHOR EVEN IF MARIO BREAKS OUT OF THE GAME HE'S STILL IN A FAKE WORLD THAT BEING OUTSIDE THE GAME MARIO CAN'T LEAVE THE COMPUTER OR EVEN PERCEIVE ANYTHING OUTSIDE IT BECAUSE ONCE YOU PROVE ALL THE RULES OF YOUR FIRST WORLD WERE BULLSHIT YOU HAVE NO BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING NEW RULES BECAUSE ANYTHING YOU SEE CAN JUST BE ANOTHER LEVEL OF THE PROGRAM SO THIS QUESTION ONLY HIGHLIGHTS THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT HUMANS ARE WAITING AROUND TALKING ABOUT GODOT
WHY WOULD YOU FOCUS EFFORTS ON ESCAPING IS THAT JUST THE MEDIA TWIST BECAUSE I'D BE A LOT MORE CONCERNED ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF OUR EXISTENCE BEFORE EVEN TRYING TO ESCAPE
IS CONSCIOUSNESS AN INEVITABLE PROPERTY OF LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE OR A HUMAN CONSTRUCT
I'M CERTAIN THAT WE INHABIT A SIMULATION OF A PREVIOUS TIME LOGICALLY THAT IS A FAR MORE LIKELY SCENARIO THAN WE JUST HAPPEN TO BE THE FIRST ONES

BUT IT GOES FURTHER THAN THIS AS OUR TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES THEN BEFORE TOO LONG WE OURSELVES WILL BE CAPABLE OF CREATING A SIMULATED UNIVERSE OCCUPIED BY AND WE CAN OBSERVE THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH EACHOTHER

THE CONCLUSION HAS TO BE THAT OUR OWN CREATORS ARE LIVING IN A SIMULATION AS ARE THE CREATORS OF THAT SIMULATION AND SO ON UPWARDS FOR MANY GENERATIONS
ASSUMING YOUR CORRECT WHAT LOGIC PERMITS YOU TO THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE
FROM THE POST

THE UNIVERSE IS HERE AND IT IS NOT HERE
YOU ARE HERE AND YOU ARE NOT HERE
YOU AREN T EVEN REALLY IN A ROOM
THERE IS NO MOON
IT S JUST INFORMATION
IT S JUST DATA


JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT REGARDLESS OF IF WE ARE IN A SIMULATION OR NOT ALL THAT STILL HOLDS TRUE EVEN IF THIS IS THE REAL UNIVERSE EVERYTHING IS JUST ENERGY AND INFORMATION ARRANGED IN CERTAIN WAYS
ISN'T THIS JUST A MORE ELOQUENT VERSION OF GOD DID IT
THE FACT IS THE REALITY WE OBSERVE AND THAT REALITY IS NOT A NEUTRAL POSITION IN PHASE SPACE WHERE THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS IS JUST ANOTHER UNFALSIFIABLE IDEALIST POSSIBILITY WE LIVE IN A SPECIFIC REALITY WHERE THE LAWS ARE FOR LIFE WHERE QUANTUM UNCERTAINTY AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT APPEAR JUST LIKE THE ERRORS AND PROCESSING SLOWDOWN OF A DIGITAL COMPUTER AND IN A HISTORY WHERE SIMULATION TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS EXTANT AND ACCELERATING TOWARD INDISTINGUISHABILITY WITH REALITY THAT MEANS THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS IS RELEVANT TO OUR FUTURE AND OUR ORIGINS WE CAN ONLY CONSIDER PROBABILITIES BASED ON OUR LOCAL SITUATION WHICH MEANS SIMPLISM HAS A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY MUCH HIGHER THAN WE CAN PROBABLY EVEN MEASURE
WHEN CONTEMPLATING DIGITAL PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY BOTH CRITICS AND THE CURIOUS MOST OFTEN ASK IF THE UNIVERSE IS AN ALGORITHM A BASIC COMPUTER PROGRAM DOESN'T THIS MERELY COMPOUND ENTITIES LIKE TURTLES ALL THE WAY DOWN WHO OR WHAT IS THIS COMPUTER THIS OTHER

THE VERY SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS ANSWER AS HAS BEEN ARGUED BY TOM CAMPBELL IN HIS MY BIG TOE BY RALPH ABRAHAM AND SISI ROY IN THEIR DIGITAL AKASHA THEORY FRANK OMEGA POINT MULTIVERSE AND IN MY OWN IDEA OF COSMOSEMIOSIS IS THAT CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF IS THE COMPUTER

CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT AN ADDITIONAL ENTITY IT IS THE OTHER ALWAYS LURKING UNEXPLAINED IN ALL FORMAL THEORIES OF NATURE NOW ACCOUNTED FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL FORM WITH NO OUTSIDE THAT COPIES ITSELF INTO ITSELF IN A FEEDBACK FRACTAL RECURSION THAT WHICH IS AWARE THAT IT IS AWARE THAT IT IS AWARE THE WATCHER OF THE WATCHER OF THE WATCHER OF THE THOUGHTS THIS DESCRIBES THE FUNDAMENTAL EXISTENCE OF THE COSMOS AND OF CONSCIOUSNESS ALL OTHER IDEAS ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS RELY UPON ASSUMPTIONS AND WISHFUL THINKING BUT COSMOSEMIOSIS DIGITAL AKASHA BMT OPM ALL SHARE A BASIC RECURSIVE FEEDBACK PRINCIPLE THAT DERIVES FUNDAMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS ALSO THESE IDEAS INVOKE NEW AGE TERMS LIKE SINGULARITY DIGITAL HOLOGRAPHIC FRACTAL QUANTUM MULTIVERSE BUT USE THEM PRECISELY AND CORRECTLY
REMOVED
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER READ SOMEONE DISCUSS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS A WAY OUT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING THAT SLIGHTLY TERRIFIED ME THAT AWARENESS OF INCONSISTENCIES THROWS THE EQUIVALENT OF A BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT COMES FROM EXPERIENCE WITH DREAMING AND LUCID DREAMING IF YOU'RE IN A DREAM AND YOU BEGIN TO HAVE AWARENESS OF THE DREAM YOU EITHER GO INTO A LUCID DREAM STATE OR YOU ARE JARRED INTO WAKING UP WE CAN EXTEND THIS TO WAKING LIFE AS THE HINDUS SAY AND POSIT THAT AWARENESS OF THE WAKING LIFE CONSTRUCT LEADS TO A JAILBREAK
WHY DO PEOPLE ENTERTAIN THIS SIMULATION IT'S SUCH A COP-OUT

EITHER WAY YOUR STILL GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE UNIVERSE IN WHICH THE SIMULATION IS RUNNING
THE BEST ARGUMENT I HAVE IN FAVOR OF REALITY BEING A SIM IS EINSTEIN SPECIAL THEORY OF REALITIVITY SPACE CONTRACTS TIME DILATES IT JUST FEELS LIKE SHITTY PROGRAMMING
WHY DO WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS SIMULATION NONSENSE SUPPOSE WE SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT THAT IT IS TRUE EITHER THE SPACE ALIENS TURN US OFF AND WE CEASE TO EXIST OR WE CONTINUE TO EXIST KNOWING THAT EVERYTHING WE DO AND ALL OUR SUFFERING IS POINTLESS WHAT A WASTE OF TIME
I CAN'T BELIEVE I RAN ONTO THIS I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT CAMPBELL AND HIS THEORIES WAS WATCHING HIS YT CHANNEL FOR A WHILE I'M A SCEPTIC BUT THIS GUY I JUST CAN'T FIND A FLAW IN HIS ARE OOOO MANY THINGS ABOUT HIM THAT I DON'T OF ALL HE CLAIMS HE IS A PHD BUT YOU CAN'T FIND HIS CREDENTIALS ANYWHERE SECOND HE SPENDS WAAAF TO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCES PSYCHEDELIC STATES AND OTHER STUFF AND THAT'S A BIG RED FLAG FOR ME ON THE OTHER SIDE HE RELIES HEAVILY ON QM SPECIFICALLY ON THE EXPERIMENTS AND QUANTUM ERASER EXPERIMENTS I'M AN ENGINEERING STUDENT AND THE STUFF HE RELIES HIS THEORIES ON IS ACTUALLY TRUE AND IS EXPERIMENTALLY PROVEN ON NUMEROUS TIMES THE PROBLEM IS WHEN HE STARTS PULLING OUT CONCLUSIONS FROM THE SAID EXPERIMENTS WHICH ARE DISTURBING TO JUMPS FROM QM AND PARTICLE PHYSICS ON THE MACRO WORLD AND STARTS PULLING OUT CONCLUSIONS THAT ARE CONTRARY WITH COMMON SENSE THE ARTICLE SUMS IT UP PRETTY GOOD BUT FOR INSTANCE CAMPBELL CLAIMS THIS IMAGINE YOU HAVE CHEST PAINS AND YOU SUSPECT IT'S SOMETHING SERIOUS SO YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR THE DOCTOR TAKES OF YOUR LUNGS AND SEES A DARK PATCH THEY DO A BIOPSY TURNS OUT YOU HAVE LUNGS CANCER INSTEAD OF DOING THAT CAMPBELL SAYS NOTHING IS REAL UNTIL A CONSCIOUS ENTITY TAKES A MEASUREMENT IN OTHER WORDS EVERYTHING IN OUR WORLD IS A PROBABILITY FIELD WHICH MEANS IF YOU HAVE CHEST PAINS IT MAY OR NOT MAY BE CANCER BUT IF YOU GO TO A DOCTOR AND HE TAKES A MEASUREMENT THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY WHAT HE FINDS IS CAMPBELL CLAIMS YOU SHOULD FOCUS YOUR MIND ENERGY IN THINKING POSITIVELY AND INCREASING YOU CHANCES THAT WHEN MEASUREMENT IS FINALLY TAKEN AT SOME POINT RESULT IS MORE FAVORABLE

CAMPBELL CLAIMS NOTHING IS REAL AND THAT YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND CAN INFLUENCE THE PROBABILITIES OF ANYTHING HAPPENING INCLUDING GROWING YOURSELF A NEW ARM OR A SPORTS CAR FLYING INTO YOUR DRIVEWAY WHILE A BULL IS PLAYING A FLUTE ON THE BACK S JUST A MATTER OF YOU BELIEVING IT WILL HARD ENOUGH THUS IMPROVING THE CHANCES
I DISAGREE ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS AS AN ESCAPE CONSCIOUSNESS SERVES 2 BIOLOGICAL PURPOSES IT SAVES US WHEN OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS WRONG 2 IT OVERWRITES OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND IF DONE ENOUGH IT CAN REWRITE PREVIOUSLY HARD CODED HABITS AND IDENTITIES

SECOND WE ARE EXTREMELY LIKELY IN A SIMULATION THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT WOULD AN ADVANCED LIFE FORM WANT TO SPEND TONS OF RESOURCES ON TO BUILD ONE I HAVE A FEW
ENTERTAINMENT THEY WATCH US OR THEY PLAY CHARACTERS POSSIBLY A GODLIKE GAME WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL PLAYS IT TO GUIDE A SPECIES TO INTER SOLAR SYSTEM AND BEYOND
SCIENTIFIC IF OUR TIME MOVES FASTER THAN THE BASE UNIVERSE THERE WOULD BE A HUGE INCENTIVE TO STUDY OUR ADVANCES AND SEE HOW WE CREATE ROCKETS CURE DISEASE ETC
HISTORICAL IN THIS THERE IS A SENSE THAT THEY COULD SIMULATE HISTORICAL FIGURES INDIVIDUALS COULD GO INTO THE SIMULATION TIME TRAVEL TO VIEW A SPECIFIC PAST FIGURE THE SIMULATION HAS BEEN SIMULATED THROUGH AND THEY CREATED RESTORE POINTS FOR CERTAIN FIGURES THAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE
ANOTHER MAY BE UNDERSTANDING THEIR PAST IF RECORDS WERE LOST ON OUR TIME
EMOTIONAL WOULD BE DATING SOMEONE

THE CRAZIEST PART IS HOW RELIGION COULD PLAY IN LIVING IN A SIMULATION ANY AND ALL RELIGION'S AFTERLIFE COULD BE RIGHT THINK ABOUT IT IF A SIMULATION CREATED SENTIENT LIFE AND THEY COULD LIVE FOREVER AT WHAT POINT IS IT OKAY EVEN IN A SIMULATION TO LET THEM DIE WHEN YOU HAVE THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO LIVE FOREVER LIKE YOU DO DO YOU LET THEM CREATE THE TECHNOLOGY AND LET THEIR EXISTENCE CEASE AT POINT OF DEATH WHEN DOES IT BECOME ETHICAL

ARE YOU SAYING SOMEONE IN REAL LIFE IS USING MY SHITTY LIFE IN THIS SIMULATION AS AN ESCAPE MECHANISM AND TO COPE WITH THEIR OWN LIFE BECAUSE IF THE PERSON IN REAL LIFE IS USING MY LIFE AS A SIMULATION TO ESCAPE THEIR LIFE THEN THEY MUST HAVE A REALLY SHITTY LIFE

MISINTERPRETED THE TITLE ON PURPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF HUMOR SORRY FOR OFF TOPIC
WOULDN'T IT BE MORE LIKELY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN INTENDED DESIGN FEATURE OF THE SIMULATION

JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN THINK DOES NOT MEAN YOU'RE NOT A MACHINE
ALTHOUGH THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS SEEMS SOMEWHAT LOGICALLY SOUND I THINK IT IGNORES SOME VERY REAL PRACTICAL PROBLEMS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SIMULATE A UNIVERSE WITH WHATEVER LAWS WE WANT RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE CONSTRAINTS THE SIMULATED UNIVERSE MUST EITHER BE MUCH SIMPLER THAN OUR OWN FOR THE SIMULATION TO RUN AT OR FASTER THAN REALTIME OR IT MUST RUN MUCH SLOWER THAN REALTIME

IF WE LIVE IN A SIMULATED UNIVERSE THAT MEANS THAT THE HOST UNIVERSE IS EITHER MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THIS ONE OR IT HAS BEEN RUNNING THIS SIMULATION MUCH LONGER THAN THIS UNIVERSE HAS EXISTED WITH A HIERARCHY OF SIMULATED UNIVERSES YOU WOULD END UP WITH UNIMAGINABLY COMPLEX OR OLD UNIVERSES SO WHAT'S THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION FOR OUR REALITY IT JUST EXISTS OR AN UNIMAGINABLY COMPLEX HIERARCHY OF UNIVERSES EXISTS IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF OURS TO ME THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO SAYING GOD CREATED THE UNIVERSE
YOU KNOW THIS IS SORT OF THE PREMISE OF BUDDHISM
THIS KIND OF SUPPOSITION IS NOT PHILOSOPHY IT IS RELIGION IT LEADS NOWHERE IT IS THE SAME AS PROPOSING A GOD HAS CONSTRUCTED OUR REALITY IN THAT CASE WHO CONSTRUCTED THE REALITY THEY RESIDE
PRO TIP DATA DOES NOT ESCAPE FROM A COMPUTER I FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS COMMON SIMULATION UNIVERSE PHILOSOPHY HOWEVER MORE AND MORE PEOPLE VIEW IT AS A LEGITIMATE EXPLANATION RATHER THAN THE METAPHOR IT REALLY IS SURE THERE ARE QUANTIFIABLE SIMILARITIES BUT THERE ARE ALSO DIFFERENCES ONE BEING THIS POST A VARIABLE DOES NOT SIMPLY ESCAPE FROM A SIMULATION
AH SO SICK OF THIS BANAL IDEA I'M AN EXPERIENCED TRIPPER AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE WHO'S DONE ACID A FEW TIMES COMES TO THIS CONCLUSION ONCE AND THEY EITHER DISMISS IT OR BELIEVE IT BUT ULTIMATELY I AM CERTAIN IT'S RIDICULOUS



LIFE ITSELF WHILE METAPHORICALLY COULD BE COMPARED TO A PROGRAMMED COMPUTER IS ORGANIC IT IS REAL AND OUR CONSCIOUSNESS OF WHICH WE HAVE TO EXPLORE THIS REALITY HAS INFINITE PERCEPTIONS I AM SLOWLY UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND IN DOING SO WHEN I TRIP I CAN VISUALLY CHANGE MY REALITY TO BEND TO MY THOUGHTS AND OF COURSE REALITY ITSELF STAYS THE SAME WHILE I'M TRIPPING BUT MY PERCEPTION AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE NOT EXPERIENCING REALITY RATHER THE INFINITE PERCEPTIONS OF MY MIND I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE WHEN YOU BREAK THROUGH THAT CONSCIOUSNESS YOU'RE NOT ESCAPING A SIMULATION YOU'RE JUST ESCAPING REALITY FOR THE SIMULATION OF YOUR MIND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE SOME EUPHORIC MOMENT AND BE LIFTED OUT OF THE MATRIX IF YOU MEDITATE ENOUGH



FOR DISCLOSURE EVERYTHING I'VE SAID IS TO PROVIDE CONTEXT NOT ARBITRARY ELEEN I APPRECIATE DISCUSSION AND WHILE I AM SURE I'M RIGHT I KNOW I COULD BE WRONG
WE SHOULD TRY LAGGING THE PROGRAM I BET WE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL IF WE DO THAT
THE SIMULATION THEORY ISN'T THAT NEW AND NOW ELON MUSK MENTIONS IT IT'S GOTTEN US THINKING ABOUT IT AGAIN

IT CANNOT BE DISPROVED THIS IS HOW RELIGIONS ARE CREATED IN MY OPINION
SO MY MAIN QUESTION IS IF WE ARE IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION WHY HASN'T IT CRASHED ALREADY THE UNIVERSE HAS BEEN GOING FOR SOME BILLION YEARS BUT THERE ARE NO ANOMALIES THAT WE ARE AWARE OF TO OUR KNOWLEDGE ANYWAY OR FATAL BLUE SCREEN OF DEATHS THAT WOULD JUST COMPLETELY WIPE EVERYTHING OUT

IF THE UNIVERSE WERE RUN BY MICROSOFT THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ALREADY IN TERMS OF THE UNIVERSE BEING A SIMULATION WHAT IS TO STOP FLUIDPHYSICS C AND QUANTUMMECHANICAL C FROM JUST CRAPPING OUT WHEN PARTICLES GO MISSING
I KNOW ED FREDKIN GREAT GUY HE LOOKS AT ELON MUSKS OBSESSION WITH AI AS FLAWED AS IF AI CAN EXIST IT ALREADY DOES AND CONTROLS OUR UNIVERSE AND HAS NO NEED TO DESTROY OR CONTROL US OTHER THEN IT ALREADY DOES
PLEASE TUNE YOUR BROWSER TO SUBREDDIT R
WHERE DOES THE COMPUTER RESIDE
IT INFURIATES ME WHEN PEOPLE THINK A SIMULATION ISN'T REAL JUST BECAUSE IT'S MADE OF NUMBERS ELECTRICITY ETC DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY MORE OR LESS REAL THAN SOMETHING MADE OF FROM DNA ATOMS ENERGY ETC SURE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VIRTUAL AND BUT TO SAY SOMETHING DOES AND OR DOESN'T EXIST JUST BECAUSE IT'S DIGITAL IS A BIT IGNORANT OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY PERCEIVE AS EXISTING


REAL ACTUALLY EXISTING AS A THING OR OCCURRING IN FACT NOT IMAGINED OR SUPPOSED

EXISTENCE THE FACT OR STATE OF LIVING OR HAVING OBJECTIVE REALITY

OBJECTIVE REALITY THE OBJECTIVE REALITY IS THE COLLECTION OF THINGS THAT WE ARE SURE EXIST INDEPENDENTLY OF US EVERY PERSON IS ABLE IN PRINCIPLE TO VERIFY EVERY ASPECT OF THE OBJECTIVE REALITY ANYTHING THAT CANNOT BE VERIFIED IN THIS WAY IS NOT PART OF THE OBJECTIVE REALITY


GRANTED THOUGHTS COULD BE VIEWED AS REAL IF MY LOGIC WAS APPLIED BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS NO CLEAR LINE TO DEFINE WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS REAL MAYBE YOU SAY IF YOU CAN TOUCH IT WELL THE SPACE BETWEEN MOLECULES COULD CRUMBLE THAT ARGUMENT PRETTY QUICKLY OR WHAT ABOUT IF YOU CAN OBSERVE IT WHAT WE CAN OBSERVE IS ONLY LIMITED BY OUR TECHNOLOGY JUST BECAUSE WE COULDN'T OBSERVE THE FURTHEST REACHES OF SPACE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE GALAXIES POPPED INTO EXISTENCE AS SOON AS WE OBSERVED THEM OR MAYBE THEY DID BUT THAT'S ANOTHER TOPIC WE COULD ONE DAY MEASURE OBSERVE QUANTIFY EACH THOUGHTS WHICH WOULD THEN PUT OUR THOUGHTS INTO THE CATEGORY OF OBJECTIVELY REAL IF THOUGHTS ARE FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND MADE FROM ELECTRICAL IMPULSES AND CHEMICALS THEN HOW COULD NUMBERS REPRESENTED BY ELECTRICITY ETC BE CONSIDERED ANY DIFFERENT


OUR REALITY IS JUST A SMALL PART OF ANOTHER REALITY WHICH IN TURN IS OUR REALITY I DON'T MEAN TO HOLD BACK THE RESEARCH ON THIS THEORY BUT ONLY WISH TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT IT


EDIT FORMATTING
THERE ARE SOME SERIOUSLY GAPING FLAWS WITH THIS ESSAY FIRST OF ALL THE NOTION THAT A SIMULATED UNIVERSE ONLY DRAWS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DRAWN DRAWING PARALLELS WITH MODERN VIDEO GAMES IS A HUGE FALLACY THERE IS A SUCH THING AS A FULL SIMULATION MEANING EVERYTHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN IS SIMULATED WHETHER ITS OBSERVED OR NOT THERE ARE ALSO PLENTY OF INSTANCES WHERE PARTICIPANTS IN A VIDEO GAME FALL THROUGH THE GAME WORLD BECAUSE THERE MUST BE SOME LIMIT TO FLOATING POINT PRECISION VIDEO GAMES RELY ON MATHEMATICAL SHORTCUTS TO EFFICIENTLY RENDER THE WORLD WHETHER IT BE GEOMETRY PHYSICS OR AI IF OUR UNIVERSE IS BEING RENDERED WITH SHORTCUTS AS THE AUTHOR ALLEGES THEN CLEARLY THOSE SHORTCUTS CAN BE EXPLOITED TO ESCAPE IT WHETHER THAT'S TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE ESCAPEE IS ANOTHER THING ALTOGETHER
DELETED
IF THE UNIVERSE IS A COMPUTER SIMULATION THEN WHY CANT CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS VARIOUS STATES JUST BE A PART OF THE CODE
THE COMPUTER SIMULATION THEORY SEEMS FASCINATING WHERE CAN I READ MORE ABOUT IT POSSIBLY A BOOK OR AN ACADEMIC PAPER
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IF THE BEINGS THAT RUN THE SIMULATION DON'T WANT US TO BE ABLE TO PROVE IT'S A SIMULATION ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS PAUSE IT WHEN SOMEONE GETS TOO CLOSE REWIND IT A BIT TWEAK A FEW THINGS LIKE REMOVE PEOPLE CHANGE MEMORIES ADJUST OUTCOMES OF EXPERIMENTS TO DISCOUNT ANY HYPOTHESIS THAT WOULD LEAD US TO THINKING WE'RE IN A SIMULATION AND START IT BACK UP SO WITH SUFFICIENTLY OBSERVANT SIMULATORS WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT WE'RE IN A SIMULATION
DO YOU MEAN THE STATE OF BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE SIMULATION OR OF REALITY
I'M SICK OF SEEING THIS COMPUTER SIMULATION THEORY BRAIN IN A VAT IS NOTHING NEW HELL SOLIPSISM IS ANCIENT FOR GOD'S SAKE SIMULATION THEORY ULTIMATELY ANSWERS ZERO QUESTIONS AND JUST TAKES THE CAN OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND MERELY KICKS IT DOWN THE ROAD DID THE ACTUAL UNIVERSE BEGIN YOU CAN'T KNOW BUFFIN IT'S ACTUALLY A COMPUTER AND IT ITSELF MAKES LITERALLY ZERO SENSE HAS ANYONE EVEN ASKED WHY FUTURE HUMANS ARE SIMULATING ANCIENT HUMANS IT'S AN ATHEISTS EQUIVALENT OF PASCALE WAGER AND ELON USES DELUSIONAL FANTASY FOR BEING ABLE TO GO FASTER THAN LIGHT
IF THE UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATION THEN THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE COMPUTER RUNNING IT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR COMPUTERS IT WOULD HELP TO PIN THAT DOWN FIRST
THE SIMPLEST ARGUMENT AGAINST EVERYTHING BEING A COMPUTER SIMULATION IS THE FACT THAT IT COSTS MONEY TO RUN SIMULATIONS SERVERS THE SPACE FOR THE SERVERS ALONG WITH ELECTRICITY TECHNOLOGISTS SALARIES TO MANAGE EVERYTHING

THE PROFIT INCENTIVE TO RUNNING THIS SIMULATION ISN'T THERE

MOST OF POPULATION OF BILLION PEOPLE ARE NOT ECONOMICALLY PRODUCTIVE AND SOMEONE'S PAYING TO RUN THIS SIMULATION WHY WOULDN'T THEY RATHER RUN SIMULATIONS OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT MAKE THEM MONEY INSTEAD OF COST THEM MONEY

COULD CONSCIOUSNESS BE A FORM OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ONE COUNTER TO THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS THAT ISN'T BROUGHT UP THAT OFTEN WHAT IF THE UNIVERSE IS NOT A COMPUTER SIMULATION BUT OUR PERCEPTION OF IT IS DUE TO OUR BRAINS ESSENTIALLY BEING COMPUTERS SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT WE EXPERIENCE THE UNIVERSE WOULD APPEAR AS A SIMULATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS REAL AND IT ONLY APPEARS THAT WAY BECAUSE WHAT WE EXPERIENCE IS OUR BRAIN PRODUCING A SIMULATION OF REALITY

IN THE ARTICLE IT TALKS ABOUT ONE CONSEQUENCE OF ACCEPTING THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS YOU WOULD SAY THE MOON ISN'T REAL BUT YOU COULD ALSO SAY THAT THE MOON IS REAL IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE THING THAT OUR BRAIN IS SIMULATING THE REAL MOON MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES AS OUR SIMULATED INTERNAL MOON AFTER ALL SOMETIMES WE ARE MISTAKEN BUT IT IS STILL A REAL THING NEVERTHELESS

I GUESS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS KIND OF SIMULATION AND THE UNIVERSAL SIMULATION IS IN THE LATER WE'RE ALL LIVING IN THE SAME SIMULATION WHEREAS IN THE FORMER WE EACH HAVE OUR OWN
I DOUBT WHOEVER MADE A SIMULATION ABOUT A RACE AS MESSED UP AS HUMANS WOULD LEAVE ANY LOOPHOLE FOR US TO GET OUT
I WOULD SAY THIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY EXPLORING THE RETRAVERSE VIA VR AR IS GOING TO BE SO COMPELLING THE RETRAVERSE IS LIKE AN AETHER THAT WILL TRANSMIT AND WEAVE NEW KINDS OF REALITIES
IF WE ARE IN A SIMULATION IS EACH PERSON THE AVATAR OF AN EXTERNAL PLAYER OR JUST SOME OR NONE HOW CAN YOU KNOW
THERE IS NO SPOON
DO NOT READ HIGH
WOULD THE CONSCIOUS STATES IN THIS EXAMPLE NOT BE MORE LIKE GRASPING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOGIC AND PROGRAMING KNOWING AND BEING ABLE TO CAUSE A DESIRED REACTION BY LEVERAGING THE LOGIC IN THE SIMULATION NOT AN ESCAPE REALLY MORE OF A EXPLOIT OF THE RULES
KNOCK KNOCK WE SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE GOD GAME OVER SHOW UP NOW
SOME PEOPLE DISMISS IDEAS LIKE THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS AND THE MULTIVERSE AS UNPROVABLE PHILOSOPHY BUT IN A FEW SHORT DECADES WE WILL BE THE ONES MAKING ADVANCED DEEP SIMULATIONS OF REGIONS OF THE MULTIVERSE SO WHETHER OR NOT WE LIVE IN A SIMULATION OR THE MULTIVERSE NATURALLY EXISTS THE MULTIVERSE WILL EXIST THROUGH OUR THOSE SIMULATED BEINGS WILL OBSERVE THAT THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS IS TRUE FOR THEM AND FOR US IN THE FUTURE AS WE WILL LIVE INSIDE THESE SIMULATIONS AS WELL



WHAT IN YOUR EXPERIENCE IS THERE TO ASSUME YOU ARE IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION THAT'S CRAZINESS ISN'T CONSCIOUSNESS ENOUGH OF AN EXPLANATION FOR THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORLD AND EXPERIENCE CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE CODING FOR THE THINGS WE EXPERIENCE LET'S SAY WE ARE IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION AND THIS IS NOT THE REAL WORLD WOULDN'T THE REAL WORLD ALSO APPEAR IN CONSCIOUSNESS AS WELL WHY MAKE EXTRA STEPS CONSCIOUSNESS IS CLEARLY THE REALITY OF WHATEVER EXPERIENCE IS POSSIBLE TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR EXPERIENCE THE DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS ONLY YOURSELF AND YOUR IMAGINATION
I ALWAYS SEE THAT LIFE MAY BE A SIMULATION BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T ANSWER WHAT'S OUTSIDE THE SIMULATION AND HOW THAT CAME TO BE

KINDA THE SAME AS IF GOD MADE US THEN WHO MADE GOD
WHAT IF WE HYPOTHETICALLY COULD MAKE A UNIVERSE COMPUTER SIMULATION WITH AN INFINITELY EXPANDING UNIVERSE WITHIN OUR POSSIBLE COMPUTER SIMULATION WE ARE IN

THAT WOULD BE PRETTY SPOOKY
I HAVE DREAMS OF CERTAIN EVENTS AND SOMETIMES THEY END UP TRUE ESSENTIALLY DE JA VU EXCEPT WHEN I DAY OR NIGHT DREAM I ALSO SEE REPEATS OF THINGS AS IF SOMEONE REWINDS AND CLICKS PLAY AGAIN
IF EXPERIENCED REALITY THE SIMULATION IS A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE BY OUR BRAINS IN A BASELINE CONTEXT AND IF OBJECTIVE REALITY IS DIFFERENT THEN IT STANDS TO REASON THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DISCERN IT THROUGH OUR BRAINS WITHOUT SOME MODIFICATIONS SOME EXPERIMENTS DO IN FACT SHOW THAT OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE REAL ACTIVELY CHANGES IT SO ANY ATTEMPT TO MEASURE REALITY BY PROXY THROUGH TECHNOLOGY MUST ALSO BE RULED OUT

THAT LEAVES US WITH ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WITH WHICH TO VIEW REALITY PSYCHIATRY HAS NAMES FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT ADHERE TO A NORMALISED SOCIALLY ACCEPTED VIEW OF REALITY

OUR REALITY HAS LAYERS THE PHYSICAL REALITY OF SHAPES WE CAN EXPERIENCE THE SECONDARY REALITY OF THE WORDS AND CONCEPTS WE ASSOCIATE WITH THESE SHAPES IF THERE IS A THIRD LAYER IT LIES BEYOND THE SHAPES AND THE NAMES AND IS ISOLATED FROM THEM

IF ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS COULD PERCEIVE REALITY WHY CAN'T WE REPLICATE THE EXPERIENCE OF VISIONARIES AND WHY DO ALL VISIONARIES NOT ALL SHARE THE SAME VISION OF REALITY
IF WE ARE IN A SIMULATION DOES THAT MEAN QUANTUM PHYSICS IS ACTUALLY HOW THE UNIVERSE IS SIMULATED LIKE BG ON A COMPUTER MONITOR THEN ALL OTHER PHYSICS WOULD BE THE THING BEING SIMULATED
I LIKE THIS MODEL

IN CAMPBELL S MODEL FREDKIN S OTHER IS CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF CAMPBELL S DEFINITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN UNUSUALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE CONSCIOUSNESS TO CAMPBELL IS ANY SYSTEM THAT CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES

INFORMATION INPUT EXPERIENCE

2 INFORMATION RECALL MEMORY

INFORMATION PROCESSING PATTERN RECOGNITION ETC

FEEDBACK LOOP LEARNING

ANY SYSTEM POSSESSING THESE FEATURES IN CAMPBELL S MODEL CAN RIGHTLY BE CALLED CONSCIOUS
CONSCIOUSNESS IT NOT MAGIC
I REALLY LIKE THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS BUT CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE ESCAPE PART OF THE IDEA OR THE IDEA LIKE THAT THIS IS A TYPE OF GAME I THINK THAT BELIEVING THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATION WITH BUILT-IN UNCERTAINTY MAKES THE MOST SENSE BECAUSE IT EXPLICITLY PROVIDES AN EXPLANATION FOR THE STATE OF THE LAWS OF PHYSICS AND MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO EXPLAIN FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE AN EVOLUTIONARY SIMULATION IN WHICH BASIC LAWS WERE WRITTEN WITH CHAOS OR UNCERTAINTY UNDERLYING THE PROGRAMMING AND THEN THE CREATOR LITERALLY JUST LET IT GO TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THIS EXPLAINS THE BIG BANG THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE UNCERTAINTY THEORY AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN RACE ALL WITHIN A SIMULATION OF A UNIVERSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AN ESCAPE OR EVEN CREATED BY HUMANS WHICH SEEMS UNLIKELY TO ME GIVEN AN INFINITE TIME PERIOD AND THE NUMBER OF BEINGS THAT MAY EXIST OVER THAT PERIOD ALSO THE TYPE OF UNDERSTANDING INVOLVED WITH CREATING A UNIVERSE WITH BUILT-IN UNCERTAINTY MAY BE OUTSIDE THE POSSIBILITY OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING UNCERTAINTY TO ME MUST BE UNCERTAIN TO THE CREATOR PROGRAMMER AS WELL FOR WHY WOULD THEY CREATE A SUCH A UNIVERSE IF THEY KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN FROM THIS STANDPOINT THERE ARE SIMPLY THINGS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE THAT CANNOT BE KNOWN OR EVEN KNOWN BY THE CREATOR WE EXIST FROM AN OBSERVATIONAL STANDPOINT OR AS AN EXPERIMENT WE ARE NOT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE BUT A BYPRODUCT OF AN EXPERIMENT IN UNIVERSE EVOLUTION
I'M STILL PERPLEXED AS TO HOW YOU FIND THE BORDERS OF THE SIMULATION IF IT IS ONE FROM WITHIN THE SIMULATION WHAT IF IT WASN'T PROGRAMMED WITH ANY EXPLOITS DON'T WE JUST GO BACK TO SQUARE NOTHING AT THAT POINT WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF ITS UNFALSIFIABLE
OR IT'S LITERALLY A SIMULATION OF A UNIVERSE
IF WE ARE STUCK IN A SIMULATION THEN CONSCIOUSNESS IS OUR BRAIN LONGING FOR OUR REAL LIVES BACK
CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SIMULATION THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE UNIVERSE IS ALSO A SIMULATION IS IRRELEVANT UNLESS WE CAN FIRST END CONSCIOUSNESS
THE UNIVERSE CANNOT BE A COMPUTER SIMULATION
THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE UNIVERSE IS A COMPUTER SIMULATION RAISES SOME INTERESTING ETHICAL ISSUES ESPECIALLY IN CONSEQUENTIALISM IF THE UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATOR AND IS CREATED BY A SIMULATOR THEN HOW LIKELY IS THAT THE SIMULATOR IS GOING TO PULL THE PLUG LATER ON

GIVEN THIS SHOULD WE MAXIMIZE OUR UTILITY IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IF WE PROCRASTINATE IN OUR ETHICAL ENDEAVORS WE MIGHT END UP NEVER ACTUALLY PUTTING THEM INTO PRACTICE SINCE THE SIMULATION MIGHT END WITHOUT ANY WARNING THUS PUTTING ALL OUR FUTURE UTILITY TO WASTE HOWEVER IF WE DON'T PROCRASTINATE AND THE FUTURE DOES IN FACT UNFOLD IT COULD MAKE THINGS WORSE OVERALL
IF THIS IS THE CASE MY ESCAPE NEEDS AN ESCAPE
THAT PARADOX IS SIMPLY THIS IF THIS UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATION THAT MEANS QUITE PARADOXICALLY IT IS HERE BUT IT IS ALSO NOT HERE WE ARE HERE AND WE ARE ALSO NOT HERE DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THE MOON ISN T THERE WHEN YOU RE NOT LOOKING THE AUTHENTIC SIMPLIST ANSWER MUST PATENTLY BE THERE IS NO MOON THIS IS THE INEVITABLE AND DISTURBING THREAD THAT SIMULATION THEORY RESEARCHERS AND PHILOSOPHERS LARGELY FAIL OR REFUSE TO ROK BUT ITS LOGIC IS SOUND AND OBVIOUS

THIS IS SLOPPY

I AM HERE NOW IS TRUE WHEREVER AND WHENEVER IT IS THOUGHT OR UTTERED THAT IS A LOGICAL TRUTH THAT THERE IS NO MOON IF WE ARE IN A SIMULATION IS NOT AND NEITHER IS IT OBVIOUS

IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT GO ASK DAVID CHALMERS
CONSCIOUSNESS IS JUST THE ABILITY TO ADAPT TO ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE BODY AND REPRODUCE IN OTHER WORDS IT IS A FEEDBACK SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS ITSELF ITS ROLE IS TO ORDER THE ORGANISM TO EAT AVOID PAIN AND SEEK SEX
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE YOUR WORD PROCESSOR IS HAVING THOUGHTS OF ITS OWN AND TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THEM TO YOU WHY WOULD YOU BELIEVE THE REST OF THIS CLAPTRAP NOT JUST THE PRESENT AUTHOR'S CLAPTRAP BUT TOO YOU ARE NOT LIVING IN VIDEO GAME NOR WHEN YOU PLAY A VIDEO GAME DO YOU SERIOUSLY ENTERTAIN THE POSSIBILITY THAT MANUSCRIPT PACMAN HAS A CRUSH ON YOU
DELETED
WELL I HAVE A DIFFERENT THEORY I THINK ELON KNOWS HE IS GONNA ADVANCE AI AND ALL THE LIVES IT DISRUPTS BUT IF HE AND THEY ARE JUST SIMULATIONS THEN NO BIGGIE I KNOW HE PAYS LIP SERVICE TO CONCERNS BUT THAT WON'T STOP HIM SO THIS IS HIS RELIGION NOW
ALL THESE PEOPLE SPEAKING OF LIFE AS A SIMULATION WHAR DOES THAT EVEN MEAN IF OUR PERCEIVED REALITY IS A SIMULATION THAN IT IS NO LONGER REALITY SO A SIMULATION FROM WHAT MUSK IS CONFUSING EVERYONE AND HE SHOULD FOCUS ON ENERGY INSTEAD OF PHILOSOPHY
WHO THE FUCK IS ELIOTT EDGE
REMOVED
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS FOR DECADES OR DEBATE THE SIMULATION ARGUMENT TILL PIGS FLY IT ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THE GOD SATAN THING IS REAL AND YOU CAN GO TO HELL BECAUSE THE AFTERLIFE IS VERY REAL IMAGINE A SIMULATED HELL YOU REALLY CAN'T FATHOM THAT REALITY AND WHY DO SPIRITS GO TO HELL
NICE PIECE I LOVE DERRID AND AND THE DERRID V AUSTIN SEARLE TEXT IS A BLAST TO READ

I THINK AN UNDERSTANDING OF DERRID GOES A LONG WAY TO HELPING ONE UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF YESTERDAYS ELECTION AMERICANS GREW WEARY OF HAVING TO ACT OUT THE DEMOCRATS PLAY
IF THIS FEELS LIKE DEJA VU I APOLOGIZE I POSTED YESTERDAY BUT IT GOT TAKEN DOWN BY A BOT BECAUSE I PHRASED THE LINK AS A QUESTION

IT WAS UNVOTED AND GENERATED A LOT OF GOOD DISCUSSION IN THE FEW HOURS BEFORE THE BOT TOOK IT DOWN SO I FIGURED PEOPLE MIGHT BE INTERESTED AND MIGHT NOT HAVE YET HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT
SO BASICALLY IF WE DO ANIMAL TESTING BECAUSE IT'S MORE HUMANE THAN TESTS ON HUMAN SUBJECTS BECAUSE THEY'RE ANIMALS THEN MAYBE THEY'RE NOT HUMAN ENOUGH FOR THE TEST RESULTS TO BE WORTH WHILE IS THAT THE PARADOX
IF IT TURNED OUT THAT THERE WERE AN INTELLECTUALLY SUPERIOR PRIMATE TO HOME SAPIENS AND THEY WERE ASKING THIS QUESTION ABOUT USING US WOULD YOU COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION
I THINK ANY QUESTION ABOUT THE ETHICS OF ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION THAT IS PERFORMED IN CONFORMITY WITH IGUAC REGULATIONS HAS TO BE CONSIDERED IN LOCK STEP WITH THE FACT THAT THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION EATS MEAT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ANIMALS ARE KILLED FOR FOOD CAN OFTEN BE CONSIDERED LESS HUMANE THAT THOSE USED IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTATION SO THEREFORE ONE HAS TO ASK WHY THE SPECIAL FOCUS ON ANIMALS IN LABORATORIES RATHER THAN IN THE ABATTOIR

THERE ARE MANY ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN THE INTERESTS OF BREVITY I WILL BE BRIEF HA HA SOCIETY FUNDS MOST OF THE BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH IN THE US THEREFORE DECISIONS MADE ABOUT THE ETHICS OF EXPERIMENTATION ARE AN ISSUE WITH ITS ATTENDANT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN WITH THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE PAYING THE TAX PAYERS AS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDIES PERFORMED IN PRIMATES ARE TOO COMPLEX AND TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING FOR A LAY PERSON TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT THEN IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE BENEFIT WHILE THE COST SIDE OF THE EQUATION MAY BE MORE SIMPLE TO GRASP FOR INSTANCE I AM A SCIENTIST ALTHOUGH I DON'T PERFORM ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY HOWEVER I HAVE TWO COLLEAGUES WHO DO AND THEY CONTEND THAT THE LOCATION AND STIMULUS PATTERNS THAT NEED TO BE USED FOR OPTIMIZATION OF DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION ARE MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY PERFORMED IN PRIMATES THAN IN HUMANS THERE ARE MANY POTENTIAL LOCI WITHIN A SPECIFIC BRAIN STRUCTURE LIKE THE NUCLEUS THAT NEED TO BE EXPLORED THE POINT HERE IS NOT TO DELVE INTO THIS ISSUE IN DEPTH BUT TO SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A STRONG CONSENSUS AMONG THOSE WHO STUDY BOTH NAPS AND HUMAN PATIENTS THAT THE FORMER EXPERIMENTS ARE EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE

IT IS ALREADY VERY DIFFICULT TO PERFORM NOP EXPERIMENTS AND NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE IN THE UK AND A FEW OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHETHER SUCH EXPERIMENTS SHOULD BE BANNED OUTRIGHT IS A QUESTION FOR SOCIETY AT LARGE WHAT MANY DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ETHICAL ISSUES THAT ARE SUBTLE I WILL RAISE ONE HERE AS A LAST POINT MANY CENTERS THAT PERFORM NOP RESEARCH ARE MOVING TO SOCIAL HOUSING HOWEVER IN BOTH THE WILD AS WELL AS IN THE LAB SOCIALLY HOUSED PRIMATES FORM INEVITABLE HIERARCHIES THOSE AT THE TOP DO VERY WELL HOWEVER THOSE AT THE BOTTOM ARE ATTACKED AND ABUSED IN MANNERS FAR LESS HUMANE THAT NAPS KEPT IN LABS WITH HUMAN TRAINERS
SO WHICH IS MORE ETHICAL
SOMEONE DEVELOP AN ARABIDOPSIS MODEL FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA
REMOVED
IT'S A PITY THE ARTICLE DIDN'T DISCUSS HARRY RESEARCH METHODS THE RESULTS WERE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO KILLING THE MYTH THAT MOTHERS SHOULD AVOID CONTACT WITH THEIR BABIES AT THE SAME TIME IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A MORE PSYCHOLOGICALLY CRUEL SET OF EXPERIMENTS TO WIT ONE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL DEVICES HE USED HE CALLED THE PIT OF DESPAIR
IF SOMEONE WRITES THAT POORLY IN TWO SENTENCES NO ONE SHOULD READ THEIR BLOG ESPECIALLY IRRITATING IS THE INCORRECT USAGE OF PARADOX
IM LESS CONCERNED WITH ETHICS THAN EFFECTIVENESS THEY SHOULD WORK ON THE SEVERE MENTAL CONDITIONS THAT HAVE PEOPLE IN THE GET THE FAMILIES TO SIGN OFF ON IT

I KNOW REGULAR VOLUNTEERS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN BUT THEY ARE OUT THERE AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
TO PROVIDE MY OWN UNAUTHORITATIVE OPINION I THINK NEW ATHEISM OUGHT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A SOCIAL MOVEMENT RATHER THAN A RIGOROUS PHILOSOPHICAL CIRCLE INDEED AS PIGLIUCCI POINTED OUT NEW ATHEISM STARTED IN REACTION TO THE ATTACKS ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BY ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS THIS SAME SENTIMENT IS SEEN QUITE CLEARLY IN POLEMICAL IN WHICH HE ARGUES THAT ORGANIZED RELIGION AS A SOCIAL PHENOMENON IN ITSELF IS POISONOUS AND CRITICISM OF THE CREATIONIST AND GENERAL ATTITUDE OF RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISTS AND A QUICK PERUSE THROUGH R ATHEISM GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT NEW ATHEISTS ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS ARISING FROM ORGANIZED RELIGION THAN THEY ARE OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IT WOULD BE ODD FOR EXAMPLE FOR HITCHENS TO CALL HIMSELF AN IF HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THE CONCEPT OF GOD IN ORGANIZED RELIGION WAS SOMEHOW SOCIALLY TOXIC IF THE GOD HYPOTHESIS WAS ENTIRELY BENIGN THERE WOULD BE NOT REASON TO CALL ONESELF AN

CONTINUING I DON'T THINK MANY THEOLOGIANS OR PHILOSOPHERS OF RELIGION WILL DISAGREE WITH ME WHEN I SAY THAT THE NEW ATHEIST CRITICISMS OF GOD ARE SUCCESSFUL AGAINST THE COMMON CONCEPTION OF GOD BY COMMON CONCEPTION OF GOD I MEAN THE ONE CRITICIZED BY THE NEW ATHEISTS AS A SKY DADDY WITH MAGIC POWERS FLOATING AROUND SOMEWHERE IN TRANSCENDENCE AND OCCASIONALLY INTERVENING IN HUMAN AFFAIRS THIS IS A CRUDE PICTURE TO BE SURE ONE THAT IS NOT PHILOSOPHICALLY RIGOROUS NOR EVEN PLAUSIBLE TO BEGIN WITH

HOWEVER IT WOULD BE HORRIBLY INCORRECT TO ASSERT THAT THIS CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRETY OF THEISTIC AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF THE CONCEPT OF THE DIVINE HAS BEEN AROUND LONG BEFORE THE TRADITIONS EMERGED IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION AND BEYOND AND IN FACT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE THEOLOGY OF RELIGIONS IS QUITE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THESE PRIOR CONCEPTS THOMAS AQUINAS FOR EXAMPLE WAS HEAVILY INDEBTED TO METAPHYSICS AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO USED BOTH ARISTOTELIAN AND METAPHYSICS MANY ISLAMIC SCHOLARS KEPT GREEK PHILOSOPHY ALIVE DURING THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE ALL OF THESE PRIOR CONCEPTIONS OF GOD WERE NOT BASED IN THE ABRAHAMIC NOTION OF GOD RATHER THE THEOLOGIANS OF THE ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS UTILIZED THESE PRIOR NOTIONS IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THEIR OWN FAITH PACE WHITEHEAD NONE OF THIS ACTUALLY DOES ANYTHING AGAINST ABRAHAMIC THEOLOGY IN GENERAL UNLESS ONE GOES IN BIASED

WHAT IS FURTHERMORE IMPORTANT IS THAT THE NEW ATHEIST CRITIQUES OF GOD ARE NOT VERY GOOD AGAINST THESE FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED CONCEPTS OF THE DIVINE THE NEW ATHEIST CRITIQUES OF GOD ARE AKIN TO THE CREATIONIST CRITICIZING A NAIVE AND SHALLOW DESCRIPTION OF EVOLUTION EVOLUTION IS MUCH MUCH MORE THAN JUST EAT OR BE EATEN THE ISSUE IS NOT WITH THE TARGET BUT WITH THOSE WHO FAIL TO SPEND ENOUGH TIME ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING THE MATERIAL IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF SCIENTISTS THAT CREATIONIST GET IT WRONG AND IT'S NOT THE FAULT OF THEOLOGIANS THAT THE NEW ATHEIST CRITIQUES FALL SHORT SO YES IF YOU ARE GOING TO PRODUCE A BOOK THAT CLAIMS GOD DOES NOT EXIST YOU SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED WHEN PEOPLE CRITICIZE YOU FOR NOT APPROACHING THE RELEVANT MATERIAL

IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE I AM UNDULY HARSH TO THE NEW ATHEISM MOVEMENT OR SCIENTISM IN GENERAL THE FACT IS THAT I AM NOT ACTUALLY OPPOSED TO CRITICISM OF ORGANIZED RELIGION SO LONG AS IT IS DONE IN A RESPECTABLE MANNER NOR AM I OPPOSED TO SCIENTISM IS GENERAL SO LONG AS IT IS ACTUALLY FORMULATED COHERENTLY WHAT I DO FIND TO BE PROBLEMATIC IS THE EXTREME ARROGANCE AND DISMISSIVE ATTITUDES PUBLIC FIGURES LIKE HARRIS OR DAWKINS HAVE THEY ARE WILLING TO DISMISS THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF PHILOSOPHY WITHOUT MUCH OF A SHRUG OR WITHOUT EVEN READING ANY PHILOSOPHY AS IF EVERYTHING THEY SAID HASN'T ALREADY BEEN SAID BEFORE AND FURTHERMORE IT IS BORDERLINE TINFOIL TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO STILL HOLD ON TO THEISTIC AND RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE CRITICISMS HAILED AGAINST THEM THIS REQUIRES THE RATHER IMPLAUSIBLE VIEW THAT EVERY SINGLE THEISTIC OR RELIGIOUS PERSON HOLDS THEIR BELIEFS PURELY OUT OF EMOTIONAL NECESSITY A FACTUALLY INCORRECT NOTION WHEN ONE ACTUALLY SITS DOWN AND STUDIES THE GIANTS LIKE AQUINAS WHO ARGUED THAT A SYNTHESIS BETWEEN OBSERVATION AND REASON COULD PROVE GOD'S EXISTENCE

ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS WITH THE CONCEPTION OF SCIENCE THOSE WHO ADVOCATE SCIENTISM TEND TO HAVE SCIENCE IS DESCRIBED AS BEING THE STUDY OF FACTS OF NATURE OR INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF THE WORLD BY EMPIRICAL METHODS YET THIS IS SUCH A BROAD CATEGORY THAT IT BORDERS ON BEING ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS YET THIS TACTIC OF VAGUENESS ALLOWS PEOPLE LIKE HARRIS TO GET AWAY WITH CLAIMING SCIENCE CAN DETERMINE HUMAN VALUES WHEN THE CONCEPT OF SCIENCE HE IS USING IS NOTHING AT ALL LIKE THE CONCEPT MOST PHILOSOPHERS OF SCIENCE OR MOST PEOPLE FOR THAT MATTER HAVE ADDITIONALLY I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN NEW ATHEISTS ARGUE THAT SCIENCE DISPROVES GOD WHEN IN FACT WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IS THAT THE GOD HYPOTHESIS AS THEY SEE IT DOES NOT ADEQUATELY FIT INTO THEIR EPISTEMOLOGY AND IS THUS UNABLE TO BE STUDIED THIS ISN'T DISPROVING GOD'S EXISTENCE THOUGH FROM THIS IT STARTS TO LOOK AS THOUGH SOME NEW ATHEISTS AREN'T ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN THEOLOGICAL MATTERS BUT SURELY DISINTEREST OR BOREDOM IS NOT AN ARGUMENT




NOTHING AGAINST THE OP OR THE TOP COMMENT HERE BUT THEY'RE BOTH OVERLOOKING A FAIRLY GOOD PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECT OF NEW ATHEISM THAT IS MISSED IN ALMOST ALL OF THE PERTINENT DISCUSSIONS IT IS MISSED IN NO SMALL PART BECAUSE NEW ATHEISTS ARE QUITE POOR AT COMMUNICATING IT BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEIR OPPONENTS ARE OFTEN TOO QUICK TO APPEAL TO SHALLOW ATTACKS LIKE RACISM OR FANATICISM AS EXPLANATIONS FOR NEW ATHEIST VIEWS

THE TAKEAWAY FROM THE MOVEMENT IS THAT RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY MATTERS AND CANNOT BE WISHED AWAY FROM POLITICS MERELY BY GRANTING ENOUGH CIVIL RIGHTS THIS UPSETS THE LIBERAL NOTION OF A CIVIL SOCIETY IF SOMEONE IS MUSLIM ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THEY WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT TERRORISM THAN IF THEY WERE CHRISTIAN IF SOMEONE IS CHRISTIAN THEY WILL BE MORE LIKELY ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL TO OPPOSE GAY RIGHTS THAN IF THEY WERE ATHEIST AND SO ON THE BOOKS THAT PEOPLE READ AND THE PLACES THAT THEY WORSHIP AFFECT WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR WORDS AND ACTIONS THESE ARE REAL ISSUES OF POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION WHICH TANGIBLE CONSEQUENCES AND THEY PROVOKE DIFFICULT POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS ON THE RELATION BETWEEN RELIGION AND BROADER SOCIETY

IT IS IMPORTANT TO JUST LAY OUT THIS FACT AND STATE IT EXPLICITLY EVEN IF YOU WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED IT OBVIOUS AND WHEN NEW ATHEISTS GET CAUGHT IN TERRIBLE ARGUMENTS OVER AND PEOPLE ARE BLIND TO THE GRAIN OF A ROBUST PHILOSOPHICAL POINT WHICH IS HIDING BEHIND THEIR RHETORICAL FAILURES THE REFUTATION OF THE IDEA THAT VAGUE NOTIONS OF TOLERANCE AND EQUALITY SUFFICE FOR OUR TREATMENT OF RELIGION

FOR ALL ITS RAILING AGAINST ILL-INFORMED POLEMICS THAT LACK DEPTH AND OR NECESSARY EXPERTISE THIS SURE READS A LOT LIKE ONE PAGES OF GET OFF MY LAWN FROM A PHILOSOPHER WHO HAS DEEMED HIS FIELD THE EXCLUSIVE ARBITER OF THEOLOGICAL AND ETHICAL DEBATE THE CONSTANT INSISTENCE TO KEEP SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY SEGREGATED RATHER THAN COMPLIMENTARY STRIKES ME AS EQUAL PARTS PRIDE AND PARANOIA
I THINK NEW ATHEISM OUGHT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS A SOCIAL MOVEMENT RATHER THAN A RIGOROUS PHILOSOPHICAL CIRCLE

NEW ATHEISM IS WAS HAS BEEN MUCH MORE A SOCIAL MOVEMENT AND LESS A PHILOSOPHICAL ONE WHERE DID YOU GET THE IDEA THAT IT WAS MORE THE OPPOSITE

AND A QUICK PERUSE THROUGH R ATHEISM GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT NEW ATHEISTS ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS ARISING FROM ORGANIZED RELIGION THAN THEY ARE OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS ARISING FROM ORGANIZED RELIGION BECAUSE THOSE THEISTS ARE TYPICALLY BEHIND ATTEMPTING TO BLOCK LEGISLATION VOTE FOR UNQUALIFIED CANDIDATES AND DISOWN THEIR CHILDREN FOR HAVING DIFFERENT BELIEFS HIGH LEVEL PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD DON T REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED REBUTTALS AS THERE ARE HIGHER PRIORITIES TO THE MODERN

IT WOULD BE ODD FOR EXAMPLE FOR HITCHENS TO CALL HIMSELF AN IF HE DIDN'T BELIEVE THE CONCEPT OF GOD IN ORGANIZED RELIGION WAS SOMEHOW SOCIALLY TOXIC IF THE GOD HYPOTHESIS WAS ENTIRELY BENIGN THERE WOULD BE NOT REASON TO CALL ONESELF AN

WHICH IS WHY MR HITCHENS LAYS OUT HIS REASONS BEHIND HIS STANCE OF SUMMARIZED AS AN OPPOSITION TO THE IDEA OF A PERSONAL INTERVENING GOD VS A DEISTIC OR DEITY

IE IF SUCH A GOD EXISTS THEN IT ALLOWS INCREDIBLE EVILS TO BEFALL INNUMERABLE INNOCENT HUMAN BEINGS MOST OF WHICH ARE CHILDREN AND CHOOSES NOT INTERVENE ON THEIR BEHALF OR A GOD THAT LENDS ITS NAME TO THEISTIC INSTITUTIONS WHOSE ENTIRE AUTHORITY RESTS ON ITS MEMBERS BELIEVING FOLLOWING TITHING FOR FEAR OF ETERNAL PUNISHMENT THAT CAUSE IMMEASURABLE AND SYSTEMIC SUFFERING BY THE ACTIONS OF ITS LEADERS CLERGY NUNS ETC

CONTINUING I DON'T THINK MANY THEOLOGIANS OR PHILOSOPHERS OF RELIGION WILL DISAGREE WITH ME WHEN I SAY THAT THE NEW ATHEIST CRITICISMS OF GOD ARE SUCCESSFUL AGAINST THE COMMON CONCEPTION OF GOD

WHICH IS ENTIRELY THEIR PURPOSE THEY COUNTER THEISTIC IDEAS THAT PROVIDE SHELTER TO OR PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION FOR BELIEVERS THAT ACT IN WAYS THEY MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE ACTED IF THEY KNEW AS FORMER THEISTS KNOW EG MANY FORMER THEISTS HELD VIEWS AS THEISTS AND JUSTIFIED IT WITH BELIEF

BY COMMON CONCEPTION OF GOD I MEAN THE ONE CRITICIZED BY THE NEW ATHEISTS AS A SKY DADDY WITH MAGIC POWERS FLOATING AROUND SOMEWHERE IN TRANSCENDENCE AND OCCASIONALLY INTERVENING IN HUMAN AFFAIRS THIS IS A CRUDE PICTURE TO BE SURE ONE THAT IS NOT PHILOSOPHICALLY RIGOROUS NOR EVEN PLAUSIBLE TO BEGIN WITH

YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THIS PERCEPTION MAKES YOUR ARGUMENT STRONGER HOWEVER THE REALITY IS THAT MOST GOD BELIEVERS HAVE POOR PHILOSOPHICAL JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR BELIEFS UNSOPHISTICATED BELIEFS FOR GODS ARE PAR FOR THE COURSE THEY CERTAINLY WERE FOR ME MY FAMILY FRIENDS SCHOOLMATES TEACHERS AND ALMOST ANY OTHER BELIEVER I INTERACTED WITH FOR THE YEARS I WAS A THEIST

HAVE YOU SEEN ANY VIDEOS BY STREET EPISTEMOLOGIST ON YOUTUBE HERE

WOULD YOU CONSIDER FAITH A RIGOROUS JUSTIFICATION FOR A GOD BELIEF HOW ABOUT I WAS RAISED THIS WAY OR I HAD A STRONG PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE DIVINE

HOWEVER IT WOULD BE HORRIBLY INCORRECT TO ASSERT THAT THIS CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRETY OF THEISTIC AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF

YOU RE RIGHT IT PROBABLY ISN T BUT I WOULD WAGER IT ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN OF IT

WHAT IS FURTHERMORE IMPORTANT IS THAT THE NEW ATHEIST CRITIQUES OF GOD ARE NOT VERY GOOD AGAINST THESE FAR MORE SOPHISTICATED CONCEPTS OF THE DIVINE THE NEW ATHEIST CRITIQUES OF GOD ARE AKIN TO THE CREATIONIST CRITICIZING A NAIVE AND SHALLOW DESCRIPTION OF EVOLUTION EVOLUTION IS MUCH MUCH MORE THAN JUST EAT OR BE EATEN THE ISSUE IS NOT WITH THE TARGET BUT WITH THOSE WHO FAIL TO SPEND ENOUGH TIME ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING THE MATERIAL

THESE SOPHISTICATED CONCEPTS OF THE DIVINE DON'T MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO PICKET ABORTION CLINICS OR DRIVE OTHERWISE SANE YOUNG MEN TO HIJACK PLANES AND FLY THEM INTO BUILDINGS

IT BEARS REPEATING A BELIEVER S CONCEPTION OF GOD IS NOT AS SOPHISTICATED AS YOU ASSUME IT TO BE AND THERE ARE MORE PRESSING MATTERS CAUSED BY GOD BELIEF THAN THEIR SUPPOSED PHILOSOPHICALLY SOPHISTICATED NATURE

IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE I AM UNDULY HARSH TO THE NEW ATHEISM MOVEMENT OR SCIENTISM IN GENERAL

I THINK YOU MISUNDERSTAND IT

IT IS BORDERLINE TINFOIL TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO STILL HOLD ON TO THEISTIC AND RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE CRITICISMS HAILED AGAINST THEM THIS REQUIRES THE RATHER IMPLAUSIBLE VIEW THAT EVERY SINGLE THEISTIC OR RELIGIOUS PERSON HOLDS THEIR BELIEFS PURELY OUT OF EMOTIONAL NECESSITY

THEY HAVE AS I DID BUT THEY AREN T COUNTERING OR ATTACKING THE REASON BEHIND THE BELIEF YOU MISUNDERSTAND BELIEF AND BECAUSE OF THIS YOU ONLY SEE THESE TWO OPTIONS AND COMMIT A FALLACY IN REASONING

ADDITIONALLY I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN NEW ATHEISTS ARGUE THAT SCIENCE DISPROVES GOD

MORE ACCURATELY SCIENCE ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR A GOD AS EXPLANATION FOR THE OBSERVABLE IT S AN UNNECESSARY POSTULATE BIOLOGISTS DON'T NEED TO ADD GOD TO THE STUDY OF GENETICS TO INCREASE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF DNA ADDING GOD TO THE EQUATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THE PHYSICIST

GREAT ARTICLE ALWAYS WORTH A READ
THAT'S A LOT OF FUCKING WORDS JUST TO PAINT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD AS A RELIGION AND THEN SAY IT IS NOT PHILOSOPHICALLY SOUND

I COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO READ MOST OF THE DRIVEL BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A WORDY ATTEMPT TO VALIDATE RELIGION AS MORE AUTHORITATIVE THAN SCIENCE

NOPE NOPE AND NOPE
I LIKE THE CHURCH OF THE FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER MYSELF IT'S BASICALLY ATHEISM BUT FUNNIER EVEN THOUGH THE FLYING SPAGHETTI MONSTER IS NOT A JOKE
FOR ALL ITS RAILING AGAINST ILL-INFORMED POLEMICS THAT LACK DEPTH AND OR NECESSARY EXPERTISE THIS SURE READS A LOT LIKE ONE PAGES OF GET OFF MY LAWN FROM A PHILOSOPHER WHO HAS DEEMED HIS FIELD THE EXCLUSIVE ARBITER OF THEOLOGICAL AND ETHICAL DEBATE THE CONSTANT INSISTENCE TO KEEP SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY SEGREGATED RATHER THAN COMPLIMENTARY STRIKES ME AS EQUAL PARTS PRIDE AND PARANOIA
THIS ARTICLE IS HEAVILY GROUNDED IN UTILITARIAN LOGIC YET NEGLECTS THE FOUNDATION OF UTILITARIANISM CONSEQUENCE YES THERE IS SUFFERING YES THERE IS PAIN BUT WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO REPLACE IT WITH WHAT SYSTEM ARE THEY PROPOSING REPLACE THE FACTORY FARM SYSTEM

OPTIONS
IE KILL OF THE CURRENT ANIMAL POPULATION IE EXTINCTION THE FASTEST WAY TO ALLEVIATE SUFFERING ON THAT SCALE IS EXTINCTION NO MORE STARVING ANIMALS IF THEY CEASE TO EXIST THE ISSUE IS DO ANIMALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXIST DO ANIMALS HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE THAT SUPERCEDES THEIR RIGHT NOT TO SUFFER

2 RETURN TO THE WILD ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO RELEASE ALL THE ANIMALS TO THE WILD PROBLEM WILD ANIMALS LIVES ALSO SUCK THERE IS PLENTY OF DEATH DISEASE AND SUFFERING IN THE WOODS THAT'S WHY HUMANS INVENTED INDOORS

HUMANE FARMING KEEP FARMING THE ANIMALS JUST TREAT THEM BETTER THE ISSUE WITH THIS IS SIMPLE ECONOMICS PEOPLE WON'T DO WHAT ISN'T IN THEIR ECONOMIC INTERESTS IF HUMANE FARMING BECOMES UNPROFITABLE PEOPLE WILL RESORT TO EITHER OPTION OR OPTION 2

AS FAR AS I KNOW THOSE ARE THE THREE OPTIONS I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD A CONVINCING 4TH CHOICE FROM THE PEOPLE I'VE TALKED TOO IT APPEARS MOST VEGANS VEGETARIANS ARE THIS MAY JUST BE A FUNCTION OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW AND NOT NATIONAL TRENDS HOWEVER PERSONALLY I WOULD CONSIDER THE RIGHT TO LIVE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RIGHT TO NOT SUFFER FACTORY FARMING DOES MAXIMIZE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ANIMALS CURRENTLY ALIVE

SEARLE IS RIGHT THAT SYNTAX DOESN'T SUFFICE FOR SEMANTICS BUT HE ALSO THINKS THE CR ARGUMENT DEMONSTRATES RATHER MORE THAN THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE ORIGINAL PAPER HE RESPONDS TO CLAIM THAT SYNTAX PLUS CAUSAL ACTIVATION OF SYNTACTICALLY INDIVIDUATED UNITS BY OBJECTS AND EVENTS OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM IS ENOUGH THE ROBOT REPLY BUT HIS RESPONSE THERE IS REALLY INSUFFICIENT

I THINK SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO CLAIM THAT THE ROBOT REPLY STILL DOESN'T GET US GENUINE UNDERSTANDING IS JUST AN ELIMINATIVIST ABOUT UNDERSTANDING ULTIMATELY SEMANTIC EXTERNALISM IS STILL REALLY THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN
I FOUND THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT QUITE INTERESTING

BUT THE WAY SHE WRITES I AT THE BUGS ME SO MUCH I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE CHARACTER IS THAT SHE WROTE IS IT ACTUALLY ANOTHER WAY OF WRITING IT
THE CRITICAL WEAKNESS OF THIS ARGUMENT COMES AT AROUND THE 2 MARK WHEN THE OUTSIDE PARTICIPANT CLAIMS YOUR CHINESE WAS PERFECT ACTUALLY

THIS IS OF COURSE A STAGED DEMONSTRATION OF THE CHINESE ROOM AND DU SAUTY NEVER ACTUALLY ANSWERS QUESTIONS BASED ON THE SLIPS OF PAPER BUT THIS BIT OF THEATER IS DESIGNED TO HIDE THE REAL PROBLEM OF THE CHINESE ROOM WOULD THAT PERSON OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE ROOM COULD SPEAK CHINESE IT SEEMS PLAUSIBLE BUT ONLY BECAUSE NO ONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD HAS EVER ACTUALLY CARRIED OUT THE EXPERIMENT SO WE ALL GO ALONG WITH CLAIM THAT THE ROOM WOULD APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND CHINESE ONCE YOU START TALKING ABOUT THE UNDERSTANDING OF A LANGUAGE YOU GET INTO SOME REALLY MURKY TERRITORY EACH SIDE HAS TO MAKE SOME INTERPRETIVE CLAIMS ABOUT WHAT THE OTHER SIDE SAID WHICH ARE BASED ON ONE'S OWN INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGNIFIER GOING BACK AND FORTH BUT A VERY SIMPLE PROBE OF THE USE OF SIGNIFIER OF A STATEMENT LIKE PLEASE CALL ME BETTY FOR EXAMPLE WOULD QUICKLY REVEAL THAT THE ROOM IS ONLY PRETENDING TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AT ALL
THE ROOM AND THE THING INSIDE THE ROOM DO NOT UNDERSTAND CHINESE THE THINGS THAT UNDERSTANDS CHINESE IS THE THING THAT WROTE THE INSTRUCTIONS
I HAVE A QUESTION

THE ARGUMENT OF THE CHINESE ROOM IS THAT A REGULAR DIGITAL COMPUTER CAN'T UNDERSTAND ONLY CALCULATE

IT'S AN INTERESTING PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM BUT IN WHAT CASES WOULD IT MATTER PRACTICALLY

I THINK IT LEAVES THE POSSIBILITY FOR A WORLD WHERE COMPUTERS CAN REPLACE ALL JOBS THERE COULD BE COMPUTERS THAT PRODUCE MUSIC AND PAINTINGS BUT IF YOUR DEFINITION OF ART REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING AND INTENTIONALITY THEN MAYBE COMPUTERS COULDN'T STILL DO ARTICLE MAYBE CREATIVITY IS BEYOND THE CAPABILITIES OF DIGITAL COMPUTERS BUT SEARLE DOESN'T ARGUE AGAINST CREATIVITY

COMPUTERS COULD STILL IMPERSONATE REAL HUMANS ON THE INTERNET IF THEY WERE EITHER PROGRAMMED TO DO IT OR CALCULATED THIS TO BE A SOLUTION FOR ANOTHER PROBLEM SO HUMANS WOULD INTERACT WITH THESE COMPUTERS LIKE REAL HUMANS

YOU COULD BUILD AN ARTIFICIAL HUMAN OUT OF A REGULAR DIGITAL COMPUTER MAYBE AS A SEX TOY YOU WOULDN'T NEED A TO LOOK LIKE A REAL HUMAN

THAT'S NOT A REFUTATION OF SEARLES ARGUMENT IF YOU AGREE WITH HIM THAT WOULD MAYBE GIVE YOU A JUSTIFICATION TO TREAT ARTIFICIAL HUMANS BADLY

I WOULD BET THAT WE WOULD EVENTUALLY TREAT THEM LIKE ORGANIC HUMANS IF THEY WERE PROGRAMMED DIRECTLY OR RATHER INDIRECTLY TO DISPLAY DISCOMFORT AND COMPLAIN AND FIGHT BACK OR GRATITUDE LIKE ORGANIC HUMANS

IS THAT TOO FAR FROM THE ORIGINAL POST IS THE POST TOO OLD
THE KEY TAKE AWAY FROM THIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS THAT SYNTAX DOES NOT SUFFICE FOR SEMANTICS YOU CAN LISTEN TO SEARLE EXPLAIN THIS POINT IN MORE DETAIL IN LECTURE OF HIS PHILOSOPHY OF MIND COURSE RELEVANT SECTION STARTS AT


PRETTY GOOD UNTIL THE NAIL BIT
HISTORICALLY THE RIGHT WING IN GERMANY WASN'T SOMETHING UNIQUE IN EUROPE IN MOST PARTS OF EUROPE WERE GOVERNED BY EXTREME RIGHT WING GOVERNMENTS SO WHEN THE AUTHOR REFERS TO HITLERISM HE SHOULD HAVE DONE HIS JOB BY DEFINING WHAT MAKES HITLER SO UNIQUE A USAGE OF THE EXPRESSION GERMAN SOUL ISN'T HELPFULLY

THE ARTICLE BECOMES INTERESTING WHEN HE WROTE

THIS CONCEPTION FREEDOM IS A FEELING THAT MAN IS ABSOLUTELY FREE IN HIS RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT SOLICIT ACTION FROM HIM

KARL MARX DEFINED FREEDOM IN A GERMAN TRADITION OF ENLIGHTENMENT BY BEING AWARE OF INFLUENCES THAT ARE SHAPING A MAN'S LIFE AND THEN IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE GERMAN WORKERS MOVEMENT WAS BORN FROM LIBERAL FOUNDED EDUCATION CLUBS FOR WORKERS EDUCATION WAS SEEN AS THE KEY TO LEVEL UP THE EXISTENCE OF HUMANS ACTION IS A RESULT OF REASONING AND IS NOT PRIMARY A FREEDOM

WHEN THE AUTHOR WROTE ABOUT MARXISM

THE SPIRIT IS NO LONGER A PURE REASON CRITICAL INQUIRY THAT PARTAKES IN A REALM OF ENDS IT IS PREY TO MATERIAL NEEDS

HE FAILS TO RECOGNIZE TRADITION OF ENLIGHTENMENT REASONING IS NOT ONLY THE WORK OF THE THINKER IN IT'S IVORY TOWER IT'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THINKING AND THE WORLD WHEN HE IS REFERRING TO ABSOLUTE FREEDOM HE IGNORES BASICALLY THAT WE ARE LIVING IN THE CONTEXT OF A SOCIETY HIS CONCEPT OF FREEDOM REFERS NOT LONGER TO EDUCATION BUT TO THE ACT OF TRANSFORM A WILL TO ACTION ONLY THIS IS THE POINT WHEN HITLER MAKES A CRITIQUE AFTER FROM A NATIONALISTIC POINT OF VIEW HE WASN'T THE FIRST ONE BUT THE ONE WHO IS KNOWN HILLERS REASONING IS SIMPLE A STRONG NATION IS GOOD FOR IT'S CITIZENS AND FOR A STRONG NATION A CITIZEN HAS TO BE COMMITTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE NATION A PROCESS OF REEDUCATION FOR THE NATION IS NEEDED THE LATTER IS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE TO A DEMOCRACY WHILE THE DEMOCRACY DOESN'T NEED A COMMITMENT THE STATE WITH FASCISTS TENDENCIES DEMANDS AN ACTIVE CONFESSION AND COLLABORATION BUT WHEN THE AUTHOR WROTE

THE PERSON WHO ACCEPTS IT THE IDEA BECOMES ITS MASTER AS DOES THE PERSON WHO PROPOSES IT THE PROPAGATION OF AN IDEA THUS CREATES A COMMUNITY OF MASTERS IT IS A PROCESS OF EQUALIZATION

HE CUTS THE RELATION BETWEEN IDEA AND WORLD INTO TWO PARTS BUT HITLER WAS IN HIS WRITINGS VERY SPECIFIC TO DESCRIBE MEANS TO RAISE THE NATION TO NEW GLORY THE IDEA OF RACISM AND FASCISM IS BOUND TO THE PROMISE FOR A BETTER LIVING OF CITIZENS AND THE REMOVAL OF ENEMIES OF THE STATE A DEMOCRACY IS DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT IT OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES BUT WHEN OPPORTUNITIES BECOME RARE LIKE IN THE PEOPLE ASKING FOR DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS

RIGHT WING IDEOLOGY IN THE MODERN SENSE WAS PREVALENT IN THE WESTERN WORLD EVEN IN SCANDINAVIA IT WASN'T UNIQUE FOR GERMANY AND IT HAS IT'S ROOTS IN THE TIME OF INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION NOT EVEN LEFTISTS LIKE KARL KAUTSKY WERE FREE OF RACISM WHEN BRUTAL COLONIALISM WAS JUSTIFIED




STEP YOU ARE A BUNCH OF RICH GUYS YOU WANT TO RAISE AN ARMY PERHAPS TO MUG YOUR NEIGHBORS

STEP 2 LOCATE A HANDY BUNCH OF TRAUMATIZED INDIVIDUALS PEOPLE HUNGRY FOR A TO SOOTHE THEIR TROUBLED SOULS IF THERE ARE NONE SUCH AVAILABLE THEN YOU CAN MANUFACTURE THEM VIA BOMBING OR

STEP CRAFT THAT SOOTHING NARRATIVE TELL A STORY ABOUT HOW THEY ARE THE CHOSEN ONES THE MASTER RACE TELL THEM THAT IT IS ONLY THESE VARIOUS MONGREL CULTURES THAT HAVE BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR TROUBLES WITH THE AND SUCH MAYBE THERE ARE EVEN SOME PREEXISTING MOTIVATIONAL MYTHOLOGIES THAT YOU CAN LEVERAGE

STEP FEED THEM THE NARRATIVE VIOLA YOU NOW HAVE AN ARMY FILLED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO COMMIT THE MOST HEINOUS OF ATROCITIES

STEP INVADE EUROPE ASIA AMERICA ETC

STEP PROFIT

THE CONCLUSION THEN IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE WHOLE SHIP IS REWORKED EVERY PLANK IS CHANGED AND WE CAN BUILD A NEW SHIP FROM IT THE NEW SHIP WITH NO ORIGINAL PLANK IS STILL THE SAME SHIP THE NEW SHIP THAT IS BUILT WILL THEN NOT BE THE ORIGINAL SHIP THIS IS BECAUSE THESEUS S ORIGINAL SHIP STILL FUNCTIONS IN THE SAME PLACE EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT OF THE SAME MATERIAL
THE EXPLANATION OF A SYSTEM OF DIFFERENCES IS A LITTLE CONFUSING I HAD THREE CONCERNS OR MAYBE MISUNDERSTANDINGS ON MY PART

IT SOUND LIKE IT'S ALL RELATIONS AND NO RELATA BUT HOW COULD THERE BE RELATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE WITHOUT THEM

IF WE DO HAVE A SYSTEM OF DIFFERENCES A NETWORK WHERE EACH NODE IS EMPTY AND HAS NO IDENTITY APART FROM ITS PLACE IN THE NETWORK THERE BE AN ARBITRARY NUMBER OF RADICALLY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS ISOMORPHIC TO THAT NETWORK IS EVERYTHING WE THINK AND SAY INNUMERABLE RADICALLY DIFFERENT THINGS ALL ONCE SO IF NOT NOTHING JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING

AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE WORLD VIA SENSORY INPUT AND THAT HAS AT LEAST SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE TALK ABOUT IF ONLY IN A DISTANT AND INDIRECT WAY BUT THIS ACCOUNT SEEMS LIKE AN IMPLICIT DENIAL THAT WE EVER DO
THIS SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE ALREADY KNEW THEY WANTED THERE TO BE A DUTY TO VOTE AND THEN SEARCHED FOR ARGUMENTS TO SUPPORT THAT VIEW INSTEAD OF IMPARTIALLY INVESTIGATING THE ISSUE TO FIND WHICHEVER CONCLUSION IS MOST PLAUSIBLE AS BERTRAND RUSSELL PUTS IT

THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH WHEN IT IS WHOLE-HEARTED MUST IGNORE MORAL CONSIDERATIONS WE CANNOT KNOW IN ADVANCE THAT THE TRUTH WILL TURN OUT TO BE WHAT IS THOUGHT EDIFYING IN A GIVEN SOCIETY

EDIT FIRST HE DESCRIBES DOWNS AND VIEW AS

WHAT'S THE PROBABILITY THAT YOUR VOTE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR VICTORY

WHICH IS THE PROBABILISTIC VIEW OF CAUSALITY AND THEN HE DESPERATELY TRIES TO DESCRIBE WHY THAT IS WRONG LIKE THIS

THE MISTAKE IS NOT IN THINKING THAT WHAT MATTERS IS WHETHER ONE'S VOTE CAUSES THE VICTORY OF YOUR FAVORED CANDIDATE THE MISTAKE IS IN THINKING THAT THE ONLY VOTES THAT CAUSE THE VICTORY ARE THOSE WITHOUT WHICH THE VICTORY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SECURED

SO NOW HE CLAIMS THAT DOWNS AND MISTAKE IS TO BELIEVE THAT AN EVENT A CAUSES AN EVENT B IFF A IS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR B I EAST TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE COUNTERFACTUAL VIEW OF CAUSALITY BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU TOLD AS AT THE BEGINNING





THIS GUY IS MY ETHICS PROFESSOR SMART GUY THOUGH I THINK HE'S WRONG HERE I DON'T THINK HE ENGAGES WITH MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE TO JUSTIFY NOT VOTING RATHER THAN TAKING THE VIEW THAT VOTING DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE AS MACINTYRE DOES THAT PEOPLE HAVE A DUTY NOT TO VOTE WHEN THEY DON'T INHERENTLY SUPPORT A POLITICIAN AS OPPOSED TO WHEN THEY SUPPORT ONE CANDIDATE BECAUSE THE OTHER IS WORSE AFTER ALL VOTING FOR THE LESSER EVIL IS STILL VOTING FOR EVIL
WHEN OFFERED A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO POLITICALLY INTOLERABLE ALTERNATIVES IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHOOSE NEITHER AND WHEN THAT CHOICE IS PRESENTED IN RIVAL ARGUMENTS AND DEBATES THAT EXCLUDE FROM PUBLIC CONSIDERATION ANY OTHER SET OF POSSIBILITIES IT BECOMES A DUTY TO WITHDRAW FROM THOSE ARGUMENTS AND DEBATES SO AS TO RESIST THE IMPOSITION OF THIS FALSE CHOICE BY THOSE WHO HAVE ARROGATED TO THEMSELVES THE POWER OF FRAMING THE ALTERNATIVES
LIBRARY ALASDAIR
MY ISSUE WITH THE ARGUMENT IS SIMPLE IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT IF MY PREFERRED CANDIDATE WINS BY A LANDSLIDE MY VOTE HAD A HIGHER CHANCE OF COUNTING THAN IF MY CANDIDATE WON BY SAY ONE VOTE MY INTUITION TELLS ME OTHERWISE

IN MY OPINION THE HIGHEST MARGINAL BENEFIT THAT RESULTS FROM THE DECISION TO VOTE IS THE BENEFIT IN YOUR REPUTATION WITHIN WHATEVER COMMUNITIES YOU IDENTIFY WITHIN THAT SAID IF YOU DON'T TELL ANYONE WHO YOU VOTED FOR THIS BENEFIT DOES NOT EXIST
UM DUH

THERE'S EFFECTIVELY NO ELECTION IF NO ONE VOTES IN THAT SENSE YES VOTING CAUSES AN ELECTION CAUSES SOMEONE TO BE ELECTED A BETTER WORD HERE IMO THAN CAUSATIVE IS CONSTITUTIVE VOTES CONSTITUTE AN ELECTION'S OUTCOME BUT THEY DON'T AT LEAST IN LARGE-SCALE ELECTIONS DETERMINE IT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

I'D ARGUE WHEN WE ASK RATIONALLY SHOULD I VOTE WHAT WE'RE REALLY ASKING IS EVERYTHING ELSE BEING EQUAL WOULD MY VOTE MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I'D ARGUE WHEN WE ASK THAT WE'RE REALLY ASKING A DETERMINATIVE QUESTION RATHER THAN A DUH CONSTITUTIVE ONE
KANT WASN'T THE BEST POLITICAL THINKER DESPITE HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO ETHICAL THOUGHT IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET MY HANDS ON A COPY OF THE METAPHYSICS OF MORALS NOT THE GROUNDWORK BUT WHEN I DID I WAS SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT KANT WAS MORE AUTHORITARIAN THAN I IMAGINED HIM TO BE THE ESSAY POSTED ISN'T THAT INFORMATIVE IN THAT IT NEVER REALLY GOES INTO HIS ACTUAL POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY INSTEAD JUST BRUSHES THE SURFACE WITH HIS ETHICS

THIS SOUND AWESOME I'M ONLY CURIOUS ABOUT HOW LONG IT'D TAKE TO RESPOND AND WHY THE SECOND LINK DOES NOT WORK SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PROGRAM OTHERWISE
I GET MY PSAT SCORES BACK BY MID-DECEMBER I HOPE THAT IS NOT TOO LATE
QUOTE FROM THE TEXT PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP DECONSTRUCTION OR A BIT OF IT NICELY
THERE IS NO METHOD TO DECONSTRUCTION BECAUSE TEXTS LITERALLY DECONSTRUCT THEMSELVES IN THEIR IMPOSSIBLE ATTEMPT TO EMPLOY LANGUAGE AS A TRANSCENDENTAL SIGNIFIER USHER EDWARDS THAT IS AS A WAY OF POINTING AT SOME ETERNAL TRUTH OR OTHER

EDIT ALSO A GOOD LINK TO SOME OF KEY CONCEPTS DIFFERENCE LOGOCENTRICISM TRACE ETC
ANTISPECIESISM DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT WE TREAT ALL ORGANISMS EQUALLY RATHER IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT WE CONSIDER INTERESTS OF EQUAL STRENGTH TO AN EQUAL EXTENT REGARDLESS OF THE SPECIES MEMBERSHIP OF THOSE INVOLVED FOR EXAMPLE ANTISPECIESISM DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT WE GIVE GORILLAS THE RIGHT TO VOTE GORILLAS HAVE NEITHER THE CAPABILITY TO USE NOR AN INTEREST IN SUCH A RIGHT ANTISPECIESISM DOES REQUIRE US TO CONSIDER GORILLAS INTERESTS IN LIFE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND FREEDOM FROM PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUFFERING AND TO AVOID FRUSTRATING THESE INTERESTS AS FAR AS IS PRACTICAL AND POSSIBLE

I FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT COULD USE SOME ELABORATION BECAUSE IS SO OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD AND MISREPRESENTED

WHAT IS A STANCE THAT EQUAL INTERESTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF SPECIES MEMBERSHIP THAT THE SUFFERING OF A DOG DESERVES NO MORE MORAL CONSIDERATION THAN THE SUFFERING OF EQUAL EXTENT OF A COW OR A CHICKEN THAT A MEMBER OF ONE SPECIES IS NOT INHERENTLY MORE VALUABLE OR DESERVING OF MORAL CONSIDERATION MERELY BECAUSE OF THEIR SPECIES

WHAT IS NOT A STANCE THAT DECLARES ALL BEINGS DESERVE THE SAME TREATMENT THAT THE LIFE OF AN AVERAGE DOG IS EQUALLY VALUABLE TO THE LIFE OF AN AVERAGE HUMAN TO THE LIFE OF A NORMAL CARROT

IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SPECIESISM TO VALUE THE LIFE OF AN AVERAGE HUMAN OVER THE LIFE OF AN AVERAGE DOG IF THAT VALUE IS BASED ON THINGS OTHER THAN SPECIES COGNITIVE ABILITY CAPACITY TO SUFFER ETC A BIG POINT IS THAT WHILE THESE THINGS MIGHT GENERALLY FOLLOW SPECIES LINES THEY DON'T ALWAYS SO AN MIGHT GENERALLY VALUE THE LIVES OF HUMANS OVER ANIMALS BUT MIGHT VALUE THE LIFE OF A CHIMP OVER A BRAINDEAD HUMAN WHEREAS A SPECIESISM WOULD VALUE THE BRAINDEAD HUMAN SIMPLY BECAUSE HE IS HUMAN AND INHERENTLY MORE VALUABLE THAN THE CHIMP

FROM PETER SINGER WHO POPULARIZED THE TERM
WHEN WE COME TO CONSIDER THE VALUE OF LIFE WE CANNOT SAY QUITE SO CONFIDENTLY THAT A LIFE IS A LIFE AND EQUALLY VALUABLE WHETHER IT IS A HUMAN LIFE OR AN ANIMAL LIFE IT WOULD NOT BE SPECIESISM TO HOLD THAT THE LIFE OF A SELF-AWARE BEING CAPABLE OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT OF PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE OF COMPLEX ACTS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON IS MORE VALUABLE THAN THE LIFE OF A BEING WITHOUT THESE CAPACITIES
ANIMAL LIBERATION BY PETER SINGER WOULD BE GOOD FURTHER READING FOR ANYONE INTERESTED HE USED THIS TERM A LOT IN HIS BOOK
AS A CASUAL OBSERVER OF THIS SUB IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF ARTICLES ON THIS TOPIC RELATIVE TO WHAT I WOULD EXPECT

IS THAT DUE TO THIS BEING A BIG AREA OF PHILOSOPHY RIGHT NOW A QUIRK OF THIS SUB A FUNCTION OF THE UNVOTE SYSTEM OR A MISPERCEPTION ON MY PART
EVEN THOUGH HABITAT DESTRUCTION AND LIVESTOCK CAUSE SUFFERING ON A MUCH LARGER SCALE THE THING THAT DISTURBS ME THE MOST IS KILLING FOR ENTERTAINMENT

WHEN PEOPLE EAT MEAT OR CONTRIBUTE TO HABITAT LOSS IT'S TERRIBLE BUT THE REASONS FOR DOING IT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE CHANGING THOSE THINGS WOULD HAVE A PRETTY MAJOR IMPACT ON YOUR LIFE SPORT HUNTING PRIZE FIGHTING SHOOTING ANIMALS THAT WANDER NEAR YOUR PROPERTY WHEN SCARING THEM WOULD HAVE SUFFICED OR EVEN GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY TO STEP ON A BUG ARE UNNECESSARY YOU HAVE DECIDED TO END A LIFE BECAUSE IT AMUSES YOU AND THAT SEEMS SADISTIC TO ME

PART OF ME THINKS THAT SPECIESISM MAKES IT EVEN WORSE HOW CAN SOMEONE KILL AN ANIMAL WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT TAKE A PICTURE WITH IT MOUNT IT ON THEIR WALL THEN TURN AROUND AND BE HORRIFIED BY THE IDEA OF A DIFFERENT ANIMAL DYING IT SEEMS SO DEVOID OF EMPATHY
IS THIS A GOOD PLACE TO TALK ABOUT THE MONKEY RAISED BY HUMANS AS A HUMAN BACK IN THE I GOT SOME SEMI INFORMED OPTIONS I WANT TO SHARE WITH STRANGERS
I REALLY LIKE THIS IT'S LOGICAL AND ETHICAL

IT'S IRONIC THOUGH THAT THERE ARE COMPARISONS BEING DRAWN BETWEEN HUMANS AND ANIMALS ON ACCOUNT OF HUMANS BEING MORE RATIONAL AND HAVING THE ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE MORE
I DON'T QUITE GET HOW AND WHEN UTILITARIANISM BECAME SO PREDOMINANT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO MENTION THAT IT'S YOUR STANDPOINT THERE IS IN FACT NO OBVIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUFFERING AND MORALITY I MIGHT SUFFER WITHOUT THE SUFFERING BEING CAUSED BY A MORAL AGENT AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THAT THIS SUFFERING HAS NO MORAL VALUE WHATSOEVER ALSO THIS TYPE OF REASONING AT LEAST AS LONG AS THE UTILITARIANISM IN QUESTION IS ABOUT MAXIMIZING HAPPINESS SEEMS TO LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT'S MORALLY WRONG IF ANIMALS SUFFER FROM LIVING IN THEIR NATURAL HABITATS I MEAN HUMANS OBVIOUSLY LIKE COMFORT BETTER THAN FIGHTING FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AND WHY WOULD THIS BE ANY DIFFERENT TO ANIMALS MOST OF THEM WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY HEATING SYSTEMS REGULAR ACCESS TO FOOD AND SO ON

EDIT FOR CLARITY WROTE THIS ON MY PHONE
IN TERMS OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH LIFE EVERYONE MAKES CHOICES EVERY DAY WE CAN MAKE CHOICES THAT DO LESS HARM TO LIFE TO OURSELVES AND TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE BIOSPHERE WE CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO IGNORE THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR CHOICES AND DO THINGS THAT SATISFY OUR IMMEDIATE SHORT-TERM PLEASURE THAT CAUSES UNNECESSARY DEATHS SUFFERING AND LONG-TERM HARM TO OURSELVES AND THE BIOSPHERE TO OUR DETRIMENT

I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE CAN MANUFACTURE ALL MANNER OF REASONS TO JUSTIFY UNNECESSARY KILLING AND CRUELTY HOWEVER AS THIS IS A SUBREDDIT ABOUT PHILOSOPHY WHICH IMPLIES CAREFUL RATIONAL THINKING IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT FORWARD A DEFENSIBLE RATIONALE THAT PROMOTES CRUELTY HARM TO OURSELVES AND OTHERS UNNECESSARY DEATHS AND A GENERAL DIMINUTION OF THE VIABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY OF THAT MAKES OUR EXISTENCE POSSIBLE BUT I SEE SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING WITH RATIONALES AND REASONING THAT HAVE NO VALIDITY I SUGGEST OUTSIDE OF THE SELF-INDULGENT WORLD OF INTELLECTUAL GAMESMANSHIP
AS A RATIONAL LOGICAL EMPATHIC HUMAN I WISH EVERY HUMAN ALSO SAW LIFE THIS WAY

MURDERING AN ANIMAL OR DESTROYING HABITATS WILLY-NILLY IS AKIN TO SOMEONE RAZING A VILLAGE OR MURDERING A HUMAN AND BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF HABITATS AND IT'S CRITICAL NOW MORE THAN EVER TO PROTECT THEM

SADLY I PREDICT THAT HUMANS WILL STOP AT NOTHING FOR THE BETTERMENT OF MAINLY HUMANS AND ONE DAY SOON BIODIVERSITY WILL ONLY EXIST IN CONVERSATIONS REGARDING SMALLER AND SMALLER ZONES REGIONS HAVE BECOME PRESERVES PRESERVES HAVE BECOME PARKS PARKS HAVE BECOME ZOOS ZOOS ARE ANIMAL HOLDING PATTERNS AT BEST

I WISH THE ZONE OF BIODIVERSITY WAS STILL OUR PLANET
A PRAGMATIC IS IT POSSIBLE AS WE ARE OMNIVORES TO SURVIVE WITHOUT EATING AN INFERIOR SPECIES HOW DO WE IMPLEMENT SUCH A SYSTEM WHAT DOES AN ANTISPECIESIST WORLD LOOK LIKE

B ANTIUTILITARIAN CONSIDERING WE ARE NOT OMNISCIENT HOW DOES ONE OBJECTIVELY MEASURE THE SUFFERING OF ALL SPECIES TO MAKE THE BEST MORAL DECISION

C KANTIAN CONSIDERING THAT ONE COULD WILL ALL ANIMALS TO BE SPECIESISM WHY SHOULD HUMANS CONTRADICT THIS SEEMINGLY UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE OF ANIMALS

D EVOLUTIONARY DOES AN ANTISPECIESIST STANDPOINT CONTRIBUTE TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR SPECIES CONSIDERING HOW FAR WE'VE MADE IT ON OUR CURRENT SPECIESISM WHY WOULD WE STOP USING THIS PRINCIPLE

WILL AS ACCORDING TO THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE WHEREBY YOU ACT ONLY ACCORDING TO THAT MAXIM WHEREBY YOU CAN AT THE SAME TIME WILL THAT IT SHOULD BECOME A UNIVERSAL LAW WITHOUT CONTRADICTION
THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS ARGUMENT IS THAT I FEEL THAT THE UNDERLYING BASIS IS ITSELF SPECIESISM THE ISSUE IS THAT THIS ARGUMENT IS ATTEMPTING TO CLAIM AN OUGHT OR SOME KIND OF OBJECTIVE MORAL DUTY WHEN THERE IS NO REASON TO DO SO IN ORDER TO HAVE A MORAL IMPERATIVE THERE MUST BE A MORAL AUTHORITY AGENT SUCH AS A PARENT THE POLICE OR A GOD WHEN IT COMES TO SUCH AN MORAL IMPERATIVE AS HOW WE OUGHT TO TREAT ANIMALS I SEE NO BASIS FOR THE IMPERATIVE OTHER THAN POSSIBLE SOCIAL UNEASE IF THE POSITION BECOMES ENTRENCHED IN OUR TRIBAL SOCIETY MEANING IT WOULD BE UNFASHIONABLE POSSIBLY ILLEGAL BUT IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THE UNIVERSE IT IS MORALLY NEUTRAL OUT OF THE MILLION SPECIES ON THIS PLANET WHY ARE HUMANS THE ONLY SPECIES THAT HAVE MORAL OBLIGATIONS WHEN A SHARK FORCEFULLY COPULATES WITH ANOTHER SHARK IT IS PERFECTLY NATURAL WHEN A GORILLA SNAPS THE NECK OF A BABY IT IS PERFECTLY NATURAL THE UNIVERSE OF LIVING THINGS IS THE GREATEST HORROR SHOW IN THE HISTORY OF CREATION IT IS FULL OF SENSELESS DEATH MURDER AND SUFFERING THE EXTENT OF WHICH BOGGLES THE MIND AND YET THERE ARE NO MORAL DUTIES FOR ANY OF IT THERE ARE NO REPERCUSSIONS NO CONSEQUENCES JUST A STANDARD EXISTENCE AS A LIVING ENTITY IN THIS UNIVERSE I SUPPOSE I WOULD AGREE WITH BUT USE IT AS A BASIS FOR A COMPLETELY CONTRARY POSITION THAT THERE IS IN THE END NO MORAL IMPERATIVE FOR US TO ACT ANY SPECIFIC WAY REGARDLESS OF HUMAN OR LIVING SPECIES I FEEL LIKE THE ARGUMENT POSTED ASSUMES A POSITION THAT IS NOT PROVEN OR EVEN ACCEPTED
ALRIGHT SO THE CASE AGAINST SPECIESISM IS BASICALLY THAT WE HAVE TO JUDGE ON SOME SEMI OBJECTIVE METRIC DID I GET THAT RIGHT THE EXAMPLE THAT THEY PRESENT IS THE SUFFERING I EAST SUFFERING OF ONE SPECIES ISN'T INHERENTLY MORE OR LESS MEANINGFUL THAN THAT OF ANOTHER SPECIES ABSENT OF OTHER FACTORS

THE PROBLEM I SEE HERE IS THAT THIS CONCEPT JUST TAKES ONE VALUE EAST G SURVIVAL OF MY SPECIES AND REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER EAST G SUFFERING AND THEN DRAWS CONCLUSION FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW THIS IDEOLOGY INTERFERES WITH REALITY AND BIOLOGY IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME I AS A HUMAN BEING CANNOT POSSIBLY JUDGE THE WORLD INDEPENDENT OF MY SPECIES THAT WOULD BE ASKING ME TO VIEW THE WORLD THROUGH A LENSE OF METRICS AND MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON RULES THAT CANNOT POSSIBLY HAVE ANY OBJECTIVE BASIS

IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT LAST SENTENCE LET ME EXPLAIN ALL OF MY SENSES AND INSTINCTS ARE SHAPED BY MY SPECIES WE INTUITIVELY EMPATHIZE WITH OTHERS BASED PRIMARILY ON THEIR SPECIES AND HOW IT RELATES TO US MOST EMPATHIZE MOST EASILY WITH OTHER PEOPLE BUT ALSO WITH DOGS AND OTHER MAMMALS HOWEVER MOST OF US DON'T EMPATHIZE AS EASILY WITH LIZARDS BIRDS FISH INSECTS OR EVEN PLANTS THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE REASON FOR THAT IT'S SIMPLY THE WAY WE EVOLVED WHENEVER THESE TOPICS SURFACE THE CONSIDERATION IS USUALLY ABOUT COWS OR OTHER ANIMALS THAT WE USE FOR OURSELVES BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE THE PHILOSOPHY STOPS I CHALLENGE YOU TO MAKE A CONCLUSIVE OBJECTIVE ARGUMENT WHY THE SUFFERING OF PLANTS IS MORE OR LESS MEANINGFUL THAN OURS INDEPENDENT OF SPECIES

SO WHY SHOULD WE EVEN CARE ABOUT OUR INTUITIVE EMPATHY IN THE FIRST PLACE JUST WATCH THE WORLD THROUGH THOSE METRIC GOGGLES AND BECOME BENEVOLENT OVERLORDS RIGHT BECAUSE WITHOUT EMPATHY NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE WITHOUT EMPATHY WE WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER ANTISPECIESISM BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT THE SUFFERING OF OTHERS EMPATHY DOESN'T EXIST AS SOME UNIVERSAL CONSTANT BY WHICH TO JUDGE THIS WORLD IT EXISTS PURELY BECAUSE IT'S EVOLUTIONARILY BENEFICIAL JUST LIKE THE PRIORITIZATION OF YOUR OWN SPECIES ANTISPECIESISM BASICALLY CONTRADICTS ITSELF

PUTTING IT DIFFERENTLY WHAT ABOUT FAMILISM FIENDISM OR EVEN LEVELISM WE CANNOT SEPARATE OUR NATURE FROM HOW WE WISH TO DEFINE OUR EXISTENCE
I HONESTLY CAN'T REALLY TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY WE DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OF INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE THERE'S NO FEASIBLE WAY TO DO SO EVEN IF SOMEONE WERE TO PERSONALLY FEEL THAT A PERSON IS LESS INTELLIGENT OR LESS USEFUL THAN A VERY SMART DOG THERE'S NO WAY TO REASONABLY APPRAISE THAT TO BE THE CASE ARGUMENTS OF INTELLIGENCE FALL APART BECAUSE IT'S MIRED IN SUBJECTIVITY WE GENERALLY GO BY THE MEAN FOR A VERY GOOD REASON SOCIETY IS INHERENTLY PARTIALLY COLLECTIVIST BECAUSE COLLECTIVIST DECISIONS AND RESPONSES WILL INSULATE INDIVIDUALS AGAINST FRINGE NEGATIVES ARGUING THAT WE ELEVATE STUPID USELESS HUMANS UNNECESSARILY IS AN ARGUMENT THAT MISSES THE NATURE OF THE ELEVATION ITSELF MOST PEOPLE EXIST ON SOME SORT OF FRINGE WE GUARD OURSELVES AS A SOCIETY AGAINST THOSE FRINGES BECAUSE THEY ARE MUDDY SUBJECTIVE PLACES IN WHICH BAD THINGS HAPPEN IF THE AUTHOR SINCERELY BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD EVER EMPLOY SUCH CONSIDERATIONS I WOULD ASK THAT THEY STAND UP FIRST I'M SURE THE SUBJECTIVE EVALUATIONS OF THEIR WORTH WOULD BE LESS THAN PLEASING TO THEM AT TIMES

IT ALSO DISREGARDS THE REALITY THAT ASPECTS OF WHAT'S BEING DISCUSSED ALREADY EXISTS IN SOCIETY IT'S WHY PEOPLE FEEL LESS EMPATHY WHEN SOMEONE LABELLED A THUG IS KILLED WE ALREADY MAKE THESE APPRAISALS OF LOW VALUE INDIVIDUALS IT'S JUST NOT CODIFIED IN OUR SOCIETY BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY TO CODIFY IT THE REJECTION OF THIS UTILITARIAN EVALUATION OF PEOPLE STEMS FROM THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO DETERMINE HOW VALUABLE A PERSON ACTUALLY IS WE CAN OCCASIONALLY MAKE ROUGH GUESSES AND FROM A VARIETY OF STANDPOINTS THAT'S REALLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH

LIKEWISE THE ARGUMENT THAT TODDLERS ARE SURPASSED BY CHICKENS IS SIMILARLY FLAWED A TODDLER WILL EVENTUALLY BE A GROWN PERSON AND THE EXPERIENCES AND SUFFERING WILL BE ENGRAINED INTO THEIR DEVELOPMENT LEADING TO ADDITIONAL EXTRANEOUS SUFFERING FURTHER DOWN THE LINE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE AN IMPLICIT UTILITARIAN STANDPOINT OF MAXIMIZING HAPPINESS THEN YOU NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE CAPACITY FOR SUFFERING TO BEGET SUFFERING VARIES CONSIDERABLY FROM CREATURE TO CREATURE A DOG THAT SUFFERS GREATLY WILL LIKELY EVENTUALLY HEAL ON A MENTAL LEVEL AND EVEN IF THEY DON'T THEIR CAPACITY TO EXIST IN A PLEASURABLE MANNER ISN'T IRREGULARLY INFRINGED UPON A CHILD THAT SUFFERS GREATLY WILL LIKELY NEVER BE ABLE TO UNDO THE DAMAGE DEALT TO THEIR SOCIAL CIRCLES EDUCATION ET CETERA THE DAMAGE IS PERMANENT EVEN IN THE SCENARIO IN THE FORM OF DELAYS AND A LOSS OF BENEFITS THE TWO CAN'T BE COMPARED

I AGREE THAT ANIMALS DESERVE FAIR RIGHTS AND THAT UNDUE SUFFERING SHOULD BE AVOIDED BUT ANY ANALYSIS THAT SEEKS TO CRITIQUE COMMON SOCIAL ETHICS NEEDS TO ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRENDS UNDERLYING THOSE ETHICS THERE ARE VERY GOOD REASONS WE DON'T TREAT A TODDLER WITH LESS ETHICAL WEIGHT THAN A CHICKEN OR IQ JIMMY WITH LESS WEIGHT THAN A PARTICULARLY SMART COW THE ARTICLE MEANDERS ABOUT ATTEMPTING TO UNDRESS SOCIAL ANALYSIS AS IRRATIONAL IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THE INVERSE IS TRUE EXCEPT IT NEVER PROVES THAT THE INVERSE IS TRUE AND IT ONLY EXAMINES A NARROW STRAW-BUILT EXAMPLE OF SOCIAL ANALYSIS
TO WHAT EXTENT DOES ACCOMODATE THE FACT THAT WE ARE MORE OR LESS BIOLOGICALLY TO CONSUMING ANIMAL PROTEIN FOR US TO FUNCTION AT OUR OPTIMUM
HONESTLY I AM NOT AGAINST EATING DOG OR PORK HOWEVER SHOULD WE BE EATING ANY OF THEM SHOULD WE BE ENGAGING IN CANNIBALISM
OKAY SO WHAT ABOUT RATS THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN FEEL PAIN SOLVE PUZZLES MAYBE THEY EVEN HAVE OTHER EMOTIONS I'M ALL FOR GETTING RID OF RATS WHERE THEY MAKE HUMAN LIFE EVEN A LITTLE BIT UNPLEASANT GOTTA DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE OR WE'LL BE WALKING WITH A BROOM PUSHING ANTS OF THE WAY SO WE DON'T STEP ON EM
I FIND IT DIFFICULT HOWEVER TO ASSERT THAT WE CAN OFFER PREFERENCE TO A CERTAIN SPECIES BASED OFF OF WHAT THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF COGNITIVE QUALITIES AND WHAT THE SECOND SPECIES DOES NOT FOR TO DO THIS IS TO ADOPT A SORT OF ETHNOCENTRISM IN TERMS OF SPECIES WHICH I DO NOT THINK CAN BE JUSTIFIED FOR HOW CAN WE FAIRLY DETERMINE THE FATE AND VALUE OF ONE SPECIES BASED OFF OF AN ETIC PERSPECTIVE WHICH ONLY CONSIDERS FROM THAT WHICH WE AS HUMANS ARE IMBUED WITH IF WE ARE THE ONLY KNOWN ONES TO HAVE THESE QUALITIES IN SHORT WE CANNOT COMPARE APPLES TO ORANGES

THIS OF COURSE IS NOT TO PROPOSE A CRITICISM OF BUT RATHER TO BRING UP THE IMPLICATIONS OF PREFERENCE UTILITARIANISM FOR WHILE I BELIEVE THIS PHILOSOPHY TO BE ONE WHICH AIMS AT THERE SEEM TO BE INHERENT FLAWS WHICH CONTRADICT THIS PRINCIPLE
THIS ARTICLE CLAIMS THAT I TREAT AND CONSIDER ALL HUMANS EQUAL REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS THAT'S FALSE IF A HUMAN LACKS INTELLIGENCE THEY MAY BE BIOLOGICALLY HUMAN BUT THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS AND MUST BE CARED FOR BY A LEGALLY COMPETENT HUMAN

A MORE PRACTICAL VIEWPOINT WOULD BE ONE OF SAPIENCE EQUALITY THOSE WITH GREATER DEGREES OF SAPIENCE HAVE GREATER VALUE THEREFORE A CHICKEN WOULD HAVE VIRTUALLY NO RIGHTS AND YOU COULD DO PRETTY MUCH WHATEVER YOU WANT TO THEM WHILE A CHIMP RAVEN OR DOLPHIN SHOULD BE PROTECTED WHENEVER POSSIBLE
THE UNIVERSE IS THE HUMAN SPECIES FOR THE TAKING
REMOVED
I'M GOING TO DISAGREE WITH THIS ONE ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT FAILS TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE EAT SOME ANIMALS AND LOVE OTHERS WHY WE TREAT SOME ANIMALS LIKE DIRT AND OTHERS LIKE GODS WHY WE DRAW ARBITRARY LINES BETWEEN SPECIES I DO NOT DISPUTE THAT ANIMALS ARE SMART EMPATHIC ETC

BUT THAT MISSES THE POINT ENTIRELY

HUMANS DON'T LOVE DOGS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMART AND EAT PIGS BECAUSE THEY'RE DUMB IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT PIGS ARE SMARTER THAN DOGS BUT THEY'RE ALSO MUCH MUCH TASTIER AND DOGS OCTOPUSES ARE FIENDISHLY INTELLIGENT BUT CATS ARE CUTER BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE WE DON'T DRAW THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN SPECIES BY HOW OBJECTIVELY WORTHY THEY ARE WE DRAW THEM BY HOW MUCH WE HUMANS GET OUT OF THEM WE THINK CATS ARE CUTE AND CHICKENS TASTE GOOD SO WE KEEP CATS AS PETS AND SLAUGHTER CHICKENS FOR FOOD

SO WHY DO SO MANY EXAMPLES OF HUMAN EXCEPTIONALISM COMPARE SPECIES IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE OR EMPATHY

HUMANS AS IT TURNS OUT ARE REALLY GOOD AT RATIONALIZING HUMANS HAVE A UNIQUELY POTENT DUALITY OF INTELLECT AND INSTINCT WHEN OUT INSTINCT GOVERNS ACTIONS THAT WE MAY NOT AGREE WITH EATING ANIMALS OPPRESSING OTHER HUMANS ETC THE MIND ENTERS A STATE OF COGNITIVE DISSONANCE WE CANNOT JUSTIFY OUT INSTINCTUAL ACTIONS WITH OUR RATIONAL MIND AND SO WE COME UP WITH LOGICALLY UNSOUND JUSTIFICATIONS EAST G CHICKENS ARE DUMB RACE IS GENETICALLY INFERIOR ETC

DOESN'T THAT DEFEND THE POINT IN THE ARTICLE

NUMBER AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE POINT IN THE ARTICLE FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ACTUAL REASONS WE PRACTICE SPECIESISM NOTHING IN THE UNIVERSE NOT HUMANS NOT ANIMALS NOT STARS OR MOONS HAS OBJECTIVE VALUE NOTHING IS ACTUALLY WORTH ANYTHING SO SAYING THAT KILLING A HUMAN AND KILLING AN ANIMAL IS TRUE IN THE SAME WAY THAT SINCE THIS MORE OR LESS INVALIDATES MUCH OF MORALITY A REVISED DEFINITION OF VALUE MUST BE USED SINCE ALL OF THIS DISCOURSE ABOUT VALUE IS BEING DONE BY HUMANS HUMANS HAVE DECIDED THAT VALUE REALLY MEANS VALUE TO HUMANS BY THIS DEFINITION HUMANS THEMSELVES ARE THE MOST VALUABLE OF ALL OUR DARWINIAN OBLIGATION IS TO OUR OWN SPECIES ABOVE ALL ELSE BEYOND THIS ANY VALUE ANYTHING HAS IS SIMPLY THAT ASSIGNED TO IT BY HUMANS BASED ON ITS USEFULNESS TO HUMANS WE CONSIDER MOSQUITOES VALUELESS AND PERHAPS EVEN OF NEGATIVE VALUE BECAUSE THEY HARM HUMANS WE CONSIDER CATS VALUABLE BECAUSE THEY BRING US JOY TO INTERACT WITH WE BUY AND SELL ANIMALS BECAUSE WE CONSIDER MONEY USEFUL AND WE CONSIDER ANIMALS USEFUL AND WE KILL AND EAT ANIMALS BECAUSE THAT KEEPS HUMANS ALIVE AND SOME ANIMALS ARE REALLY QUITE DELICIOUS BACON I'M LOOKING AT YOU

BUT ISN'T MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON HUMAN DEFINITIONS OF VALUE SPECIESISM IN AND OF ITSELF

YES HOWEVER WITHOUT A CONSISTENT BASIS FOR MORALITY WE ARE ROBBED OF ALL DECISION-MAKING POWER WE ARE HUMAN AND AS SUCH OUR DECISIONS ARE GOING TO BE MADE FROM A HUMAN POINT OF VIEW WE WOULD NOT EXPECT A SHARK TO SPARE AN OCTOPUS ON THE BASIS OF ITS INTELLIGENCE WHY DO WE HOLD OURSELVES TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD IF HUMANS AND ANIMALS ARE TRULY EQUAL THAN WE SHOULD TREAT OURSELVES THE SAME AS WE TREAT ANIMALS AS PREDATORS WE EAT OUR PREY

TO SUM UP

A NOTHING HAS OBJECTIVE VALUE

B ARGUMENTS ABOUT INTELLIGENCE OR EMPATHY COME FROM THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE FORMED WHEN WE DRAW SIMILARITIES BETWEEN OURSELVES AND ANIMALS THEN SEE THE VAST GAPS IN TREATMENT

COUNTY IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS WE DEFINE VALUE AS VALUE TO HUMANS

D OUR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AND SO MORALITY IS FOUNDED ON COUNTY

THEREFORE

GIVING ANIMALS VALUE OUTSIDE OF UTILITY TO HUMANS IS LOGICALLY UNSOUND SINCE WE ARE HUMAN WE MAKE OUR DECISIONS FROM A HUMAN PERSPECTIVE AND THEREFORE ABUSING KILLING AND OR EATING ANIMALS TO BENEFIT HUMANS IS NOT ONLY ACCEPTABLE BUT ALSO NATURAL
MY BIGGEST GRIPE WITH PHILOSOPHIES SUCH AS THIS IS WHILE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE GROUNDED ON THE MORALITY OF THE SITUATION IT IS IN FACT MORE GROUNDED BY PEOPLE'S COGNITIVE APPRAISALS ASSOCIATIONS TRANSLATION OUR BELIEF IN WHAT IS MORAL TOWARDS SPECIES IS OFTEN CONTROLLED BY OTHER VARIABLES OF THE SPECIES IN QUESTION IE INTELLIGENCE ABILITY TO SHOW EMOTION SIMILARITY WITH HUMANS LOOKS PERSONALITY FUNCTION DOMESTICATED OR WILD HUMANS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE OVER THE MISTREATMENT OF MONKEYS LIONS DOGS CATS HORSES ETC THAN INSECTS WORMS CRUSTACEANS SNAKES SPIDERS ANTS AND RATS ETC IS IT HOW HUMANS DESTROY THE NATURAL HABITATS OF COUNTLESS SPECIES AND SLAUGHTER COUNTLESS MORE FOR FOOD YES IS IT IMMORAL QUITE POSSIBLY IS IT PRACTICAL OR EVEN MORALLY OBLIGATORY TO FOLLOW AN IDEAL WHERE WE CONSIDER THE PERSPECTIVE OF ALL SPECIES BEFORE WE ACT I DON'T BELIEVE SO

BUT OF COURSE THE PEOPLE ARGUING FOR THIS WILL STILL SAY A FETUS HAS NO RIGHT TO LIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT HAS UNIQUE DNA AND IS SCIENTIFICALLY ALIVE
THE NATURE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANIMALS AND THE RIGHTS WE GIVE THEM ARE RIGHTFULLY UTILITARIAN WE DON'T EAT CATS AND DOGS BECAUSE WE BRED THEM FOR JOBS AND OR COMPANIONSHIP THEY ARE EFFECTIVE AT THAT BECAUSE WE SELECTED THEM TO BE EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE
WE EAT MEAT BECAUSE IT'S NUTRITIOUS AND OUR BRAINS REWARD US FOR HUNTING COOKING AND EATING IT CULINARY ARTS ARE A HUGE PART OF CULTURAL HISTORY AND NATIONAL IDENTITY AND MEAT IS AN INSEPARABLE COMPONENT OF THAT EATING MEAT IS RIGHT FROM A BIOLOGICAL STANDPOINT AND THAT'S A VERY GOOD BASIS FOR AN ARGUMENT AN ANIMAL'S DEATH IS AN UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT A SACRIFICE THAT WE BENEFIT FROM IMMENSELY
WE CAN DO MUCH TO IMPROVE THE LIMITED LIVES OF OUR LIVESTOCK AND TO MITIGATE THEIR SUFFERING BUT UNTIL WE CAN PRODUCE DELICIOUS NUTRITIOUS MEAT AT AN INDUSTRIAL SCALE VIA PAINLESS LABORATORY PROCEDURES MAINTAINING FARMS IS THE BEST METHOD OF SATIATING THE DEMAND

THE ONLY REASON WE'RE NOT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST BLACKS OR WOMEN ANYMORE IS BECAUSE THEY REVOLTED AGAINST US IF ANIMALS REVOLTED I WOULD INSTANTLY PERCEIVE THEM AS INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO BE TREATED EQUAL TO MANUAL
IT WOULD SEEM THAT IS FOUNDED FROM A UTILITARIAN PRINCIPLE UTILITARIANISM IS MORALLY BANKRUPT AND IN THIS CASE BASED ON IRRELEVANT QUESTIONS WETHER AN ANIMAL MAY SUFFER IS NOT RELEVANT ALL BEINGS MAY SUFFER AND HAVE INTERESTS HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT ENTITLE THEM TO ANYTHING HUMANS HAVE A STATUS ABOVE ALL OTHER SPECIES GOING BEYOND ANY PURE QUESTION OF SUFFERING
NOW I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO MAKE AN ANIMAL SUFFER WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE CHRISTIAN POSITION THAT A HUMAN LIFE IS WORTH INFINITE ANIMAL LIVES A HUMAN IS GIVEN A SPECIAL SOUL THAT OTHER SPECIES DO NOT HAVE
HM TOWARDS THE END HE GETS MORE AND MORE RUSHED EXCITED AND I DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW HOW HE APPLIED THE MATH RESULT THAT FOR ANY PLURALITY CARDINALITY THE CARDINALITY OF ALL ITS ARE GREATER THAN THE FORMER PLURALITY TO THE MODAL WORLDS OF A PERSON AND HOW THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE VAN NEUMANN LIMITATION OF SIZE PRINCIPLES OF THE UNIQUENESS OF THE ABSOLUTE INFINITE HOW WAS THE LINK FROM MATH TO ONTOLOGY MADE IS IT IN FACT AN ARGUMENT THAT THE NUMBER OF OF THE ABSOLUTE INFINITE ARE BIGGER THAN THE ABSOLUTE INFINITE IF SO IS THIS A VALID MATHEMATICAL REASONING
I AGREE WITH HIS CRITIQUES OF CONSERVATIVE ONTOLOGY BUT THE ADDER TYPE ONTOLOGY SEEMS AN ODD CONCLUSION TO DRAW FROM THE SHORTCOMINGS OF COMMON SENSE I THINK THIS IS THE TYPE OF PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE DISSOLVED THROUGH PRAGMATISM I EAST THE EXISTENCE OF INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS IS BASED ON SOCIAL CONVENTIONS THAT ARE THEMSELVES BASED ON FRAMING REALITY IN WAYS THAT ARE USEFUL TO US AS FOR WHAT EXISTS INDEPENDENTLY OF HUMAN PERCEPTION AND SOCIAL CONVENTIONS I GUESS IT WOULD BE EITHER SOMETHING LIKE THE TOTALITY OF EXISTENCE OR POSSIBLY INDIVIDUAL SUBATOMIC PARTICLES EITHER OF WHICH IS MORE OF A SUBTRACTER POSITION THE POINT BEING I DON'T SEE THE USEFULNESS OF THE ADDER VIEWPOINT OTHER THAN TO POINT OUT THE LOGICAL ABSURDITIES OF THE CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINT

TRYING TO GET A MAJOR PARTY TO SUPPORT A POLICY BY VOTING FOR A MINOR PARTY ENDORSING THAT POLICY IS SIMILARLY INEFFECTIVE THE MAJOR PARTY MAY INSTEAD CONCEDE THAT POLICY'S SUPPORTERS TO THE MINOR PARTY AND SEEK OTHER WAYS TO MAKE UP THE LOST VOTES THIS IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY WHEN THE MINOR PARTY IS FURTHER FROM THE CENTER THAN THE MAJOR PARTY IF DEMOCRATS MOVE RIGHT AND WIN OVER A REPUBLICAN VOTER THEY GAIN A VOTE WHILE THE REPUBLICANS LOSE A VOTE BUT IF DEMOCRATS MOVE LEFT AND WIN OVER A GREEN VOTER THEY GAIN A VOTE WITHOUT REDUCING THE REPUBLICAN TOTAL SO AS LONG AS GREENS HAVE LESS SUPPORT THAN REPUBLICANS WINNING REPUBLICAN VOTES IS TWICE AS GOOD AS WINNING GREEN VOTES PIVOTAL ROLE IN CERTAINLY DIDN'T CREATE A LEFT-WING RESURGENCE WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TWO YEARS LATER DEMOCRATIC SENATORS VOTED FOR THE IRAQ WAR

PRIMARIES MAKE IT EASIER TO TAKE OVER AN EXISTING PARTY THAN TO WIN WITH A NEW ONE WINNING THREE-WAY GENERAL ELECTIONS REQUIRES AT LEAST A THIRD OF THE VOTERS WILL WIN IF THE OPPONENTS ARE DIVIDED AT AND BUT USUALLY THE OPPOSITION WON'T BE SO NEATLY DIVIDED AND MORE THAN WILL BE NEEDED BUT OVER A THIRD OF THE ELECTORATE IS ALWAYS ENOUGH VOTERS TO TAKE OVER ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES AND WIN ITS NOMINATION IF OVER A THIRD OF THE POPULATION SUPPORTS A POLICY IT'S MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR BOTH MAJOR PARTIES TO CONSIST OF MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE POPULATION ENTIRELY OPPOSING THE POLICY SO IDEAS WITH ENOUGH DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT TO WIN THREE-WAY GENERAL ELECTIONS WILL ALWAYS HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO ENTER AND WIN A PRIMARY
THIS WOULD BE MORE INTERESTING IF IT WASN'T SO
YOU'RE MAKING AT LEAST TWO DISTINCT CLAIMS HERE

CAUSAL EXPLANATION RESTS ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS AN EXTERNAL WORLD AND SKEPTICISM IS IRREFUTABLE SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR CAUSAL EXPLANATION

2 A SUCCESSFUL CAUSAL EXPLANATION OF SOME EVENT REQUIRES US TO SHOW THAT THAT EVENT WAS NECESSITATED PER SE WHICH MEANS THAT WE NEED TO GIVE AN EXPLANATION AS WELL FOR ANY PUTATIVE CAUSE OF THAT EVENT HENCE INFINITE REGRESS ETC ETC AND WE ASK SEE WHERE THAT'S GOING

THE PROBLEM IS THAT NEITHER PREMISE SEEMS PARTICULARLY PLAUSIBLE LOTS OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN EPISTEMOLOGY TO DIRECTLY RESPOND TO SKEPTICAL WORRIES WHICH THE PRESENT ARGUMENT DOESN'T ENGAGE WITH THE SECOND CLAIM JUST SEEMS PRIMA FACIE FALSE THAT THE COFFEE IS HOT PLUS SOME SCIENTIFIC THEORY REGARDING PHYSIOLOGY AND THERMODYNAMICS ETC SEEMS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN A BURNED TONGUE IF I TOLD YOU THE PHENOMENON WASN'T EXPLAINED UNTIL YOU HAD RETRODICTED THE COFFEE'S TEMPERATURE LAPLACIAN FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES ANY REASONABLE PERSON WOULD REGARD ME AS HAVING MISSED THE POINT RATHER BADLY
THE EXISTENCE OF GOD DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE A CAUSE IF ONE ASSUMES THAT GOD IS ALMIGHTY OMNIPOTENT
PARAGRAPHS INDENTATIONS SUBHEADING THAT WAS HARD TO READ

2 INFINITE REGRESS IS DEALT WITH VIA EXPERIMENTATION ITSELF HOW DO YOU DO AN EXPERIMENT YOU MAKE A POT OF HOT COFFEE AND A POT OF COLD COFFEE AND GIVE IT TO VOLUNTEERS YOU COULD EVEN DO ONE BETTER AND PREPARE COFFEE IN DIFFERENT MANNERS KETTLE PRESS HEATER ETC IF HOT COFFEE ALWAYS BURNS PEOPLE AND COLD COFFEE NEVER DOES REGARDLESS OF HOW THE WATER BECAME HOT COLD THEN IT IS THE HOTNESS THAT CAUSED THE BURN AND NOT THE METHOD USED TO MAKE THE COFFEE HOT THIS IS ALSO THE RATIONALE BEHIND RANDOMIZATION WE DON'T KNOW EACH PARTICIPANTS HISTORY WE DON'T KNOW ALL POSSIBLE VARIABLES THAT COULD EFFECT OUR OUTCOME BUT BY RANDOMIZING PARTICIPANTS WE CAN AVERAGE ACROSS HISTORIES AVERAGE ACROSS VARIABLES AND THEREFORE ONLY THE VARIABLE OF INTEREST IS DIFFERENT ACROSS CONDITIONS
THAT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE
THE WHOLE POINT OF COMPUTERS THE DRIVE TO CREATE THEM IS BASED ON THE NEED TO MAKE MECHANISMS THAT COULD AUTOMATE TASKS INVENTED FOR THEM BY HUMANS

IT'S A WAY TO SHORTHAND OUR FACULTIES INTO THESE REPETITIVE PROGRAMMED OBJECTS BUT I THINK IT IS A GRAVE ERROR TO SUGGEST THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE HUMANS HAVE SHOWN THE CAPACITY FOR ALGORITHMIC TASKS THAT THIS IS THE EXTENT OF OUR ABILITIES

THE PROBLEM ISN'T EVER HORSEPOWER BECAUSE SURELY WE CAN CREATE MACHINES THAT ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO PERFORM CALCULATIONS FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN WE CAN THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE AS HUMANS ARE THE LIMITING FACTOR ON THE CREATION OF NEW FORMULAS INSIGHTS AND GENERAL RULES THAT CONSTITUTE THE DOMAIN OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WE CREATE BY OUR INTUITIONS
IN WHAT SENSE CAN A FIELD OF ARGUMENTS TOWARDS TRUTH BE BASED ON YOUR REGION OR LANGUAGE

VERY SIMPLE IF THE ARGUMENTS INCLUDE A LOT OF DISGUISED AND UNEXAMINED ASSUMPTIONS PERHAPS ACCIDENTALLY ABSORBED FROM BACKGROUND CULTURE AND THE MODE OF INQUIRY IS FUNDAMENTALLY WEAKENED BY THE LACK OF ANY UNIVERSAL CRITERIA SO THAT WHO SAID IT IS ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT WAS SAID

IN THE STORY RECOUNTED HERE ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY'S EARLY SUCCESS IN LOGIC IS HIGHLIGHTED BUT THAT BECAME A BRANCH OF MATHEMATICS AS SOON AS IT WAS REALISED THAT IT HAD SUCH A WELL-DEFINED STRUCTURE

PHILOSOPHY IS NOT SCIENCE OR MATHEMATICS IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY AGREED BASIS IT IS CHARACTERISED BY CULTURE AND SCHISMS AND GRIEVANCES AND TRIBAL ALLEGIANCES
QUESTION WHY DO YOU CALL THIS A SECRET SURELY IT'S BEEN COMMON KNOWLEDGE FOR A CENTURY NOW

QUESTION 2 WHY DO DESCRIBE THIS ALLEGED SECRET AS DIRTY AND LITTLE NEITHER SEEM FITTING

MY ONLY OTHER INITIAL COMMENT WOULD BE THAT A UNIVERSITY WANTS ITS DEPARTMENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL UNIVERSITIES ARE PARTLY BUSINESSES MY BEST GUESS IS THAT MEASURING A SUCCESS IS DONE BY LOOKING AT STUDENT DEMAND IF IT'S UP SOMETHING GOOD IS GOING ON TIED INTO THIS IF SOME OF THIS DEMAND IS COMING VIA OTHER DEPARTMENTS YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL

SO A GOOD PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT WHICH SEES DEMAND COMING IN FROM POLITICAL SCIENCE PHYSICS MATH ETC DEPARTMENTS MIGHT BE DOING VERY WELL WHEN DEPARTMENTS FIT WELL TOGETHER THE UNIVERSITY IS OFTEN MOST SUCCESSFUL

THAT'S JUST MY GUESS YOU CAN FILL IN THE BLANKS I THINK FROM THERE
BUT THE BEST PHILOSOPHY THE STUFF THAT LASTS AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY READ AND LOVE DOES BELONG TO LITERATURE AND PRETTY MUCH ONLY THERE PHILOSOPHY THAT DOES NOT SUCCEED AS WRITING AS ART CANNOT LIVE IMHO
FOR THOSE WHO FOUND THIS INTERESTING YOU SHOULD REALLY CHECK OUT THE AUTHORS PODCAST THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY WITHOUT ANY GAPS HE COVERED ANCIENT GREEK HELLENIC AND ROMAN PHILOSOPHY BEFORE GOING THROUGH PHILOSOPHY IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND IS NOW COVERING PHILOSOPHY IN WESTERN EUROPE AND WILL SOON BE COVERING BYZANTINE PHILOSOPHY HE ALSO HAS A SEPARATE PODCAST WITH ANOTHER SCHOLAR THAT COVERS THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY IN INDIA ALL AMAZING STUFF
GREAT READ BUT I AM A LITTLE SKEPTIC WHEN HE SAYS

READERS OF ARABIC HAD ABOUT THE SAME DEGREE OF ACCESS TO ARISTOTLE THAT READERS OF ENGLISH DO TODAY

FROM MY UNDERSTANDING GREEK PHILOSOPHY HAD SUCCESS ONLY AMONG THE ELITES AND SOME CALIF
ARABS HELP SPREAD PLATO AND SOME OF ARISTOTLE TO WESTERN LATIN EUROPE BUT IT WAS ALREADY COMPLETELY PRESERVED AND EXISTING IN THE EASTERN ROMAN EMPIRE THROUGHOUT THE SAME TIME NOT TO DOWNPLAY THE ROLE OF MUSLIM PHILOSOPHERS WHO WROTE INFLUENTIAL COMMENTARIES ON THEM OR ANYTHING BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THE CENTRIC VIEW THAT TENDS TO IGNORE THAT THE BYZANTINE EXISTED AND PRESERVED THE GREEK CLASSICS

SORRY FOR SPELLING MISTAKES AND GRAMMAR ERRORS I WAS ON MY PHONE WHEN I TYPED THIS
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD EPISODE OF IN OUR TIME ON AVERROES THAT EXPLORES THE INTERNAL POLITICAL AND THEOLOGICAL MOTIVATIONS OF THE CALIPHATE
THERE IS A BOOK CALLED ISLAMIC SCIENCE AND THE MAKING OF THE EUROPEAN RENAISSANCE BY GEORGE SALIBA A PROFESSOR AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY WITH THE SAME IDEA
FROM WHAT I REMEMBER ON THE SUBJECT THE GREEK PHILOSOPHY TEXTS WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY TRANSLATED BY JEWS AND CHRISTIANS LIVING IN ARAB LANDS
OLD IRISH MONASTERIES ALSO SAVED GREEK BOOKS FROM THE DARK TIMES BOOK BURNING INQUISITION PLUS ISLAM AND ARABS GOT MANY OF THEM FROM CONQUERING EASTERN EUROPE FROM THE BYZANTINE ORTHODOX CHURCH NOT ROME CATHOLICS UNLIKE THE THEN CATHOLIC CHURCH LEADERSHIP POPES HATING ON SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE AND ACTED BY CALLING PEOPLE HERETICS THE ISLAMIC LEADERSHIP CONSIDERED IT PART OF KNOWING GOD'S CREATION

THAT ARTICLE IS NOT AS BAD AS MOST THAT REINFORCE THE DISGUSTING WESTERN MYTH THAT ARABS SAVED GREEK TEXTS IN REALITY IF THE ARABS DIDN'T INVADE MUCH THE MIDEAST AND THE TURKS MAINLAND GREECE THE ANCIENT GREEK WORKS WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFUSE INFLUENTIAL AND HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER PRESERVED MOST THE TRANSLATORS WHERE SYRIAC SPEAKING CHRISTIANS



THE TRANSLATORS WHO CARRIED OUT THIS WORK WERE NOT FROM A SINGLE COMMUNITY AND CAME FROM MANY ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS BACKGROUNDS IMPORTANT TRANSLATORS WERE MUSLIMS LIKE IBN YOUSUF IBN MAAR AD AND AL ABBAS IBN SA D D AFTER AND EVEN ṢĀBI ANS LIKE THEBIT IBN BURRAH D BUT CHRISTIANS MADE UP A VERY LARGE PROPORTION OF THESE TRANSLATORS WHY WAS THAT



CHRISTIANS IN THESE COMMUNITIES RECEIVED THEIR EDUCATION IN MONASTIC SCHOOLS WHERE THEY STUDIED IN SYRIAC BUT WERE ALSO TAUGHT GREEK THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MOREOVER THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE THAT MORE ADVANCED SCHOOLING IN THESE SYRIAC CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES INVOLVED THE STUDY OF ANCIENT GREEK BOOKS OF SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY AND MANY OF THESE BOOKS WERE TRANSLATED INTO SYRIAC

AND



HOW WAS IT THAT IN THE NINTH CENTURY THIS MASSIVE HELLENIC INFUSION INTO THE FORMATION OF ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION CAME ABOUT THE ANSWER LIES IN THE OBSERVATION THAT A PORTION OF BYZANTINE CIVILIZATION HAD SURVIVED THE ISLAMIC CONQUESTS AND HAD LONG BEEN RESIDENT IN THE LANDS OF THE CALIPHATE EVEN BEFORE THE CONQUESTS HERE WE ARE SPEAKING OF WHAT HAS BEEN TERMED SYRIAN HELLENISM THE CHRISTIANS BOTH MONOPHYSITE AND NESTORIAN HAD LONG AGO ADOPTED THE CURRICULUM OF THE LATE GREEK SCHOOLS OF ALEXANDRIA SO THAT THE STUDY OF GREEK ARISTOTLE PLATO PORPHYRY HOMER AND OTHER AUTHORS REMAINED STANDARD IN MANY OF THE SCHOOLS IN THE VERY LANDS OF THE CALIPHATE MEDICINE HAD LONG BEEN A MONOPOLY OF THE SYRIAC CHRISTIANS AND IT WAS THEY WHO PLAYED THE MAJOR ROLE IN THE TRANSLATION OF THE GREEK TEXTS OFTEN VIA SYRIAC INTO ARABIC

EVEN UNTIL GREEK INDEPENDENCE MOST GREEKS CALLED THEMSELVES ROMAIOI AND WHAT THEY THEY CALLED THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE WAS ROME MEANING THEY AND THE CONQUERED MIDEAST CHRISTIANS WHO WILL LIKELY BE EXTINCT EVERY WHERE BUT EGYPT BEFORE THE WAY EVERYTHING IS GOING ARE THE LINK TO ANTIQUITY NOT THE ARABS DESPITE THE WEST WANTING TO GIVE THE ARABS CREDIT BECAUSE THAT IS HOW THEY FIRST ENCOUNTERED MUCH OF THE ANCIENT GREEK CORPUS VIA THE ARABS WHO INVADED IBERIA

IT IS KIND OF SICK TO GIVE THE CONQUERING MUSLIM ARABS CREDIT FOR THE PRE-CHRISTIAN ANTIQUITY THEY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH RESPECT FOR AND INSTEAD SELECTIVELY

SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHEN READING THE PRINCE IS THE CONTEXT PROVIDED BY THE LIFE OF NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI THE PRINCE WAS WRITTEN FOR LORENZO DE MEDICI THE MEDICI BEING THE FAMILY THAT HAD HIM IMPRISONED AND TORTURED FOR A SHORT WHILE BEFORE THE PRINCE WAS WRITTEN JUST LEAVING THIS TIDBIT HERE
THE VIDEO DOESN'T EVEN OUTLINE WHAT MAKES A GOOD RULER IT JUST TALKS ABOUT MACHIAVELLI AND THROWS IN A BUNCH OF FILLER WHILE DRAWING RANDOM STUFF WHY DOES HE TALK ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF POLITICS
THIS VIDEO COMPLETELY NEGLECTS TO EXPLAIN CONCEPT OF FORTUNE WHICH IS A MAIN CONCEPT OF THE PIECE

DEFINITION OF FORTUNE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO A EFFECTIVENESS THIS VERSION OF FORTUNE IS MOST CLOSELY TRANSLATED TO LUCK A RULER SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE SITUATIONS WHERE FACTORS ARE OUT OF HIS CONTROL AND MAKE NECESSARY PROVISIONS FOR THESE CASES

FOR INSTANCE A RULER WANTS TO MAKE A DAM HE HAS ALREADY ATTAINED THE LABOR AND RESOURCES BUT HE SHOULD ALSO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE IN THE EVENT OF A FLOOD HOW DOES HE ACQUIRE MORE RESOURCES HOW DOES HE QUELL PUBLIC OUTRAGE OVER EXPENSES AND POSSIBLY DEATHS HOW DOES HE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DAM

ACCORDING TO MACHIAVELLI AN EFFECTIVE RULER LIMITS FORTUNE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALL RULERS ARE MORTAL ILLNESS IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE AND PREDISPOSED TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES THEREFORE IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT THE RULER ACCOUNTS FOR FORTUNE WHENEVER POSSIBLE

THIS IS A CORE CONCEPT OF THE PIECE THE VIDEO REALLY SHOULD DISCUSS IT
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST READ IT OR LISTEN TO IT ON A WALK IT'S A VERY SHORT BOOK HERE'S AN UNABRIDGED READING
THE MAIN THING I GOT FROM THE PRINCE WAS A STRONG FOUNDATION IS THE KEY TO POWER HAPPY PEOPLE COUPLED WITH A COMPETENT MILITARY AND DECENT ECONOMY WILL ENSURE A LASTING PRINCEDOM ALSO BE WARY THAT EVERYONE IS OUT FOR THEIR OWN GAIN AND TO ALWAYS INTERPRET THE TRUE MEANING BEHIND ACTIONS POWER IS LIKE A CHESS GAME AND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE TWO STEPS AHEAD

IN A RELATED NOTE AFTER I READ THE BOOK I BECAME MUCH BETTER AT CIV

NEVER TRUST GANDHI SOME MEN JUST WANT TO WATCH THE WORLD BURN

JOHN II OF PORTUGAL WAS CALLED PERFECT PRINCE AFTER HIS DEATH SINCE HE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRINCE OF MACHIAVELLI DURING HIS LIFETIME ISABELLA OF CASTILE THE MAIN RIVALS OF PORTUGAL CALLED HIM EL HOMBRE THE MAN
OF COURSE THIS COMES OUT AFTER I DO A MINUTES PRESENTATION ON THE PRINCE
CANDIDATES NO DOUBT KNOW WORDS

WOULD IT BE CONTROVERSIAL TO SAY NUMBER IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT DONALD TRUMP IS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING ABOUT THE PRINCE BEYOND A VAGUE POP CULTURE DESCRIPTION
A GREAT DESCRIPTION OF MACHIAVELLI AND HIS IMPACT AND MOTIVATIONS WITH SOME MORE DEPTH FROM A RENAISSANCE HISTORIAN HERE
FOR ANYONE WHO HASN'T YET I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING THE WHOLE TEXT ON YOUR OWN IT'S DIRT CHEAP ONLINE AND IT'S WELL WORTH THE READ
THIS IS A VIDEO I THINK EVERYONE HERE WILL ENJOY VERY MUCH IT'S CALLED THE RULES FOR RULERS BY BGP GREY
WAS THE PRINCE NOT WRITTEN AS HOW NOT TO RUN A COUNTRY A SATIRE OF SOME SORTS
REMOVED
CAN WE THROW SOME MONEY IN THE HAT AND GET THIS GUY A BETTER MICROPHONE
GREAT SUMMARY PROPS ON CREATING A NOSTRADAMUS EFFECT WHEREBY YOU CAN VIEW THIS THROUGH A HILLARY OR TRUMP LENSE
I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS IS A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF A LEADER NOR THAT MACHIAVELLI WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO DESCRIBE A LEADER RATHER THAN HOW TO NAVIGATE POLITICAL CONFLICTS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A VENETIAN MERCHANT OR HOW HE THOUGHT SOMEONE IN POWER SHOULD ACT DESPITE NEVER WIELDING ANY SIGNIFICANT POWER HIMSELF BY ASCRIBING ANIMAL CHARACTERISTICS AND COMPARISONS TO CERTAIN ACTIONS I THINK THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF SPIRIT ANIMALS PERHAPS BE LIKE THE WOLF OR THE WEASEL I THINK THE REAL ATTRACTION TO THIS BOOK IS MORE OF A SURVIVING INSIGHT INTO HOW BUSINESS AND OPERATING WITHIN A POLITICAL FRAMEWORK WAS DONE IN THAT PERIOD PERHAPS AS A RESULT OF BEING PROPERLY TRANSLATED I THINK WHICH IS UNIQUE BUT DOESN'T IMPART ANY REAL KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO BE A LEADER THIS BOOK FINDS ITSELF ON FAR TOO MANY READING LISTS DESPITE BEING RATHER TAME IN CONTENTION WHAT I'D RATHER ASK IS COULD YOU RECOMMEND ANY SAME ERA OR OLDER ALTERNATIVES THAT AREN'T AS WIDELY KNOWN AND READ LIKE A ROBERT LUDLUM NOVEL I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THE BOOK HAS INFLUENCED ME PERSONALLY ON HOW TO NEGATE CONFLICT AND BE PERSUASIVE
I CAN'T HELP BUT BE REMINDED OF THE WHEEL OF TIME SERIES BY ROBERT JORDAN AS COMPLETED BY BRANDON SANDERSON IN IT YOU SEE MULTIPLE LEADERS GOOD AND BAD HOW THEY INSPIRE SUBJECTS AND FOLLOWERS THROUGH DEEDS TO BRING ABOUT EVENTS THAT SHAPE SURE IT'S A FANTASY SERIES BUT IN OWN WORDS HE WANTED TO EXPRESS HOW IT FELT TO BE PICKED BY FATE TO RISE TO A NEED AND TO HELP INFLUENCE THOSE AROUND HIM OR THEM MANY CHARACTERS FOUGHT TO THEIR VERY LAST TO SHIRK THIS INBORN ABILITY TO CALL THOSE NEEDED TO THEIR SIDE SIMPLE BECAUSE THEY INSPIRE OTHERS TO DO WHAT THEY BELIEVED TO BE THE CORRECT ACTION BE IT THROUGH FEAR COERCION PROOF OF ABILITY OR FORCE OF WILL TO SHOW THE MASSES WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE I FOUND IT TO BE INCREDIBLY INSIGHTFUL ON WHAT MAKES A LEADER
A GOOD LEADER IS HARD TO SELECTION IT VERY MUCH DEPENDS ON CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUT OF YOUR CONTROL LIKE SPAWN AREA AND OTHER CIVILIZATIONS AROUND BUT THE HARDEST PART IS ACTUALLY THAT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF VICTORY YOU WILL BE GOING FOR BEFORE YOU START
THIS WAS GREAT THANK YOU
THIS STRIKES ME MORE AS TIPS TO BE A SUCCESSFUL RULER THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING RULING AND LEADING

LEADERSHIP IS THE ART OF MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO ACCOMPLISH TASKS NOT TERRIFYING THEM INTO SUBMISSION THE BASIS OF A GOOD LEADER INVOLVES PALPABLE COMMITMENT TO THOSE ON THE TEAM CLARITY OF GOALS THE INTEGRITY TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON PROMISES TO TEAM MEMBERS THE MORAL COURAGE TO PROTECT YOUR TEAM AND ALSO EAT ANY BLAME WHILE LETTING THEM GET THE PRAISE
ALOT OF WHAT MACHIAVELLI WROTE WAS SO CASE SPECIFIC IN THE PRINCE THAT THE GENERALIZATIONS MADE ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND HOW TO CONTROL POWER DERIVED FROM THE BOOK ARE INHERENTLY FLAWED THE BOOK SERVES AS A SPECIFIC HOW-TO MANUAL FOR THIS NEWLY APPOINTED PRINCE FROM A MAN WHO WANTED TO HAVE HIS CLASS REINSTATED WITH THE NEW MONARCH IT SHOULDN'T SERVE AS THE INTELLECTUAL ARGUMENT FOR THAT IT DOES TODAY
JUST WANT TO ADD THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS WORK BEING TAKEN AS A SATIRE IT NEVER CROSSED MY MIND WHEN READING IT AS SUCH A WORK IT IS A VERY INTERESTING READ I AGREE WITH THOSE WHO THINK THAT IT IS A SERIOUS PIECE OF WRITING I SUSPECT THE ACCUSATIONS OF SATIRE COME FROM CREDULITY OF SOME READERS THAT POLITICAL LEADERSHIP COULD BE SO DUPLICITOUS AND PRAISED FOR IT

IT WAS WRITTEN AS AN EXTENDED JOB APPLICATION BY MACHIAVELLI TO THE MEDICI IRONICALLY THEY MAY HAVE DECIDED THAT A MAN WHO ADVOCATES DECEPTION STRONGLY MAY NOT BE THE PERSON TO PLACE A LOT OF TRUTH AND RESPONSIBILITY IN

IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN READING IT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE TRANSLATION BY TIM PARKS IT IS VERY CONTEMPORARY AND HAS AN EXCELLENT INTRODUCTION EXPLAINING THE CONTEXT OF THE BOOK
WHAT MAKES A LEADER IS ONE THAT IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN POWER

WHAT MAKES A LEADER GOOD IS ONE THAT IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN POWER AND BRING ABOUT POSITIVE EFFECT FOR THE PEOPLE THEY LEAD
VERY INTERESTING AND RELEVANCE TO THE MODERN ERA ECHOED BY THIS OTHER VIDEO THAT MADE THE FRONT PAGE OF REDDIN LAST WEEK
POINTS AND ARGUMENTS DON'T REALLY COME ACROSS TO ME AS RIGOROUS AFTER ALL HE USES OR 2 HISTORICAL EXAMPLES AND MAKES SWEEPING GENERALIZATIONS FALLING VICTIM TO THE INDUCTIVE FALLACY PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG

I HAVEN'T STUDIED MACHIAVELLI A LOT BUT COULD SOMEONE ENLIGHTEN ME AS TO WHAT IMPACT MORE ELABORATION THAN IN THE VIDEO WRITINGS BOTH THE PRINCE AND DISCOURSES ON LIVY HAD ON POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT AT THE TIME AND HOW IT DOES NOW

EDIT AS MANY USERS POINTED OUT IT SEEMS THAT MY OBSERVATION AND OPINION OF STYLE WAS SUPERFICIAL I AM GOING TO THE PRINCE AND FINISH DISCOURSES ON LIVY SO I CAN GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING THANKS TO ALL WHO RESPONDED
FANTASTIC VIDEO VERY INFORMATIVE ON THE SUBJECT THANKS
I READ THIS PIECE AND I AM PRETTY SURE THAT THIS WAS A HIGHLY SATIRICAL WORK MEANT AS A JAB AT THE LEADERSHIP AT THE TIME CONSIDERING LEGS WERE BROKEN AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE HISTORY BOOK I READ FOR TREASON OR SOME OTHER REASON IT MAKES SENSE HE WOULD WANT SOME KIND OF SWEET REVENGE
MODERN ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE PRINCE IS A SATIRE AND THAT MACHIAVELLI WAS REALLY IN FAVOR OF A REPUBLIC NOT A PRINCIPALITY MONARCHY ABSOLUTIST
GOOD SHOULD BE IN QUOTES
REMOVED
I LIKED THE VIDEO BUT I CRINGED EVERY TIME THE SCREEN FLICKERED BLUE BECAUSE THE CREATOR DIDN'T SET A WHITE BALANCE AND LEFT IT ON AUTO IT'S REALLY EASY AND SIMPLE TO DO IT TAKES A COUPLE OF SECONDS TO DO PRIOR TO TAPING AND HELPS THE AUDIENCE STAY ENGAGED WITH THE CONTENTION
REMOVED
IN MODERN POLITICS I PREFER REPRESENTATIVES TO LEADERS THERE IS A DISTINCTION IT SEEMS MOST OF US WOULD RATHER A LEADER TELL US WHAT TO DO THAN US TELL A REPRESENTATIVE WHAT OUR WILL IS
WHAT MAKES A GOOD VIDEO NOT THIS
WASN'T HE BEING SARCASTIC IN THE PRINCE
JUST ASK DONALD TRUMP
WHO MADE HIM THE EXPERT ON LEADERSHIP
LEADERSHIP CANNOT BE TAUGHT THO IT CAN BE LEARNED
HAD AN EXAM ON THIS ON TUESDAY WHY COULDN'T YOU POST THIS ON TUESDAY
THE VIDEO MISSES THE POINT COMPLETELY OF COURSE AS WE ALL KNOW MACHIAVELLI WAS SECRETLY A MARXISTS AND WAS DESCRIBING HOW POWER WORKS BECAUSE THAT WOULD TOTALLY BE DIFFERENT IN A MARXIST SYSTEM

EDIT MY SARCASTIC GRAMCI JOKES ARE NOT APPRECIATED
I'VE ALWAYS HELD THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY AT A YOUNGER AGE BEFORE THEY'RE EDUCATED THEY SHOULD KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY QUESTION THE EDUCATION THEY'RE RECEIVING IT MAY ALSO HELP TEENAGERS BE MORE EMPATHETIC PERHAPS LEADING TO LESS BULLYING AND AN OVERALL BETTER EXPERIENCE IN HIGH SCHOOL
CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND SOME GOOD RESOURCES FOR FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADERS MY SONS WOULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM THIS
NOT SURE IF THIS IS WHAT THE AUTHOR MEANT BUT AT THE END OF THE ARTICLE IS THE AUTHOR IMPLYING THAT IF A TREE FELL IN A WOOD IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION ITS BEEN SOLVED FOR SOME TIME NOW TREE FALLING MAKES A SOUND WAVE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANYONE HEARS IT SOUND IS WHEN SOMEONE HEARS A SOUND WAVE NO EARS NO SOUND
I THINK IT IS A WONDERFUL INITIATIVE THIS OF TEACHING PHILOSOPHY TO CHILDREN
I COULDN'T HANDLE LAWSON FROM ABOUT MINS IN HAD TO STOP
I THINK HE'S TRYING TO SAY BEHIND HIS BAD TEMPER THERE ARE MANY WAYS WE CAN DESCRIBE SOMETHING AND NO ONE WAY IS INDISPENSABLE SO WHY SHOULD WE PRIVILEGE SOME ONE WAY OVER THE OTHERS WE SHOULDN'T BUT THEN HE ARGUES THAT DOING SO HAS CAUSED WARS AND THOSE ARE BAD AS IF TO ANSWER HIS OWN QUESTION AND OFFER AN INDISPENSABLE DESCRIPTION

I AM AS AGAINST REALISM AS THEY COME BUT IT'S HARD TO THINK SEARLE WAS AT ALL CHALLENGED HERE HAVING RAW INTELLIGENCE AND GETTING EMOTIONAL CAN BE VERY ATTRACTIVE BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE MISTAKEN FOR BEING GOOD AT THE SUBJECT YOU'RE GETTING EMOTIONAL ABOUT

I TAKE POSITION AS AN ELEGANT AND REFINED VERSION OF THE REALISM OF MAINSTREAM PHILOSOPHY THE TERMS ONTOLOGICAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL OBJECTIVE SUBJECTIVE ARE WELL UTILISED IN HIS SCHEMA HERE TO MEET POOR FORMS OF AND TO CLARIFY FORMS OF REALISM THE ISSUE IS WHILE IT MEETS THESE POOR FORMS IT DOESN'T ESTABLISH A REASON FOR REALISM SEARLE WOULD SAY NO REASON NEEDS TO BE ESTABLISHED BUT HERE HE'S CONFLATING ON THE SENSE OF REALISM AS HOW ORDINARY PEOPLE THINK AND THE SENSE OF HOW PHILOSOPHERS HAVE THOUGHT AND I WOULD CHALLENGE THE NEED FOR THE PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION NOT TO SAY IT'S OBVIOUSLY GOOD OR BAD IT'S JUST AN INTERESTING QUESTION TO ME


IT STANDS TO REASON THOUGH THAT RELATIVISM PRECEDES PERSPECTIVALISM
SAW THIS GREAT VIDEO FROM A NEW PHILOSOPHY YOUTUBER CALLED THE UNEMPLOYED PHILOSOPHER IF YOU LIKE THE VIDEO THEN SHOW YOUR SUPPORT FOR HER ON PATRON AS SHE IS HOPING TO FUND A PHD THROUGH THIS AND BECOME A LECTURER I THINK SHE'LL BE A GOOD ONE
FIRSTLY WHY TALK SO FAST WELL ITS A TROPE IN ORDER TO PROJECT A PERSONAE CELEBRITY WHICH IS VERY RATHER THAN CLEARLY PRESENT SOME POINT THERE IS OF COURSE IN THIS A SENSE OF IRONY AND PLAYFULNESS WHICH IS ANOTHER HALLMARK OF POST MODERNITY EAST G IN STATING ONE WANTS TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR BUT THEN NOT DOING SO IN THIS CASE BY TALKING SO FAST AND IN THE MAIN ABOUT LITERATURE IN DETAIL IT FAILED TO MENTION THE FINE ARTS OR ARCHITECTURE POLITICS OR GENDER ISSUES COLONIALISM QUEER THEORY VERY LITTLE PHILOSOPHY A FEW NAMES APPEARED AND IN THE MAIN CONCENTRATED ON LITERATURE YET EVEN HERE FEW WORKS OR NAMES WERE GIVEN WERE LIKE THE MODERNS JUST A GIVEN THEY THE EINSTEIN IDEA OF EVERYTHING BEING RELATIVE WAS IMO THE LOW POINT

SO AS AN EXAMPLE OF IT WAS VERY GOOD RATHER THAN EXPLAIN OR SHOW AN OBJECTIVE TRUTH IT INDULGED IN PERSONAL SELF REFERENCE AND PERFORMANCE SO IN A VIDEO WHERE EXAMPLES OF MODERNIST ART COULD BE SHOWN ROTHKO JUDD LE WITT LE CORBUSIER THE BAUHAUS VAN DER ROHE AND COMPARED TO WARHOL JEFF KOONS THE ABAS AND THE SEMINAL LEARNING FROM LAS VEGAS INSTEAD WE HAD THE IMAGE OF A GIRL WITH A NICE TOP AND THE EYEBROW MAKE UP SO POPULAR THESE DAYS THAT PARTICULAR SHAPE THE BOOK SHELF A SIGN OF LEARNING BUT NOW ADORNED WITH FAIRY LIGHTS AND CUTE CERAMIC ANIMALS AS IN NOW ART GALLERIES WHICH WERE ONCE INSTITUTIONS FOR LEARNING AND WHERE WORKS OF SUBLIME BEAUTY WERE DISPLAYED NOW WE HAVE GALLERIES WHICH ARE MORE LIKE DISNEY WORLD FOR GROWN UPS WHERE WHAT EVER IT MEANS TO YOU IS WHAT IT MEANS AND IN FILM BLADE RUNNER ICON VS A MODERNIST FUTURE WHICH NEVER HAPPENED


AS A ZEN STUDENT HUANG PO DIED AD IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MASTERS TO READ I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT THE FOLKS OF R PHILOSOPHY THINK OF HIS TEACHINGS BEAR IN MIND THAT YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF CULTURAL TRAPPINGS IN THE DISCUSSIONS AND THE FOOTNOTES CAN HELP A READER WADE THROUGH THOSE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT OFTEN WHEN HE USES THE TERM BUDDHA HE REFERS NOT NECESSARILY TO THE HISTORICAL FIGURE SIDDHARTHA GAUTAMA BUT TO THE FUNDAMENTAL OF AN INDIVIDUAL

I CAN DO MY BEST TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE CONFUSION OF THE PARTICULARLY CRYPTIC STYLE OF CONVERSATION CHARACTERISTIC OF ZEN THANKS FOR THE CONVERSATION EVERYONE
I ENJOYED READING THAT FIRST TIME ABSORBING HIS MATERIAL FIRST HAND I HAD A THOUGHT I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHY OF ONE MIND SATORI DIDN'T QUITE WARM UP TO THE MATERIAL BECAUSE THEY WERE PUT OFF BY THE WHOLE REINCARNATION AND THE ROUNDS OF REBIRTH THING UNLIKE SATORI GROUNDLESS GROUND WHATEVER YOU LIKE WHICH IS AND CAN BE SEEN BY ANY HUMAN AT ANY TIME REINCARNATION DOESN'T HAVE A SECULAR CORRELATE THE ESOTERIC TEACHINGS WOULD BENEFIT THE WEST SO MUCH BUT REINCARNATION DOESN'T HAVE A WESTERN USE IT DOESN'T CROSS OVER
THE ADVICE STARTS AT THE APPENDIX ON PAGE
BY NONE OTHER THAN ARGON OF AKKAD I DON'T LIKE THE GUYS IDEAS AT ALL NOT ONE BIT BUT I FIND THIS ENTERPRISE OF HIS VERY WORTHY OF RESPECT PHILOSOPHICALLY WORTHY AND GOTTA GRANT IT TO THE GUY HE DOES HAVE A GREAT READING VOICE AND HIS DICTION IS QUITE NICE

SO KIDDOS TO HIM HE HAS A BUNCH OF READINGS OF ANCIENT TEXTS IN HIS CHANNEL AND MAYBE THIS CAN GET PEOPLE THAT LIKE ARGON MORE INTO THE GOOD OLD CANON A MAN CAN HOPE
I DON'T THINK THIS SUMMARY IS VERY GOOD HERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT ARE OFFICIAL

REDUCTIONISM THAT COMPLEX SENTENCES BOIL DOWN AND GET THEIR MEANING FROM SMALLER UNITS I EAST ATOMIC UNITS

THIS ISN'T THE REDUCTIONISM THAT QUINE IS TARGETING RATHER THE REDUCTIONISM HE'S TARGETING IS THE THESIS THAT MEANINGFUL SENTENCES ARE COMPOSED OF TERMS THAT ULTIMATELY REFER TO IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE NOT JUST THAT COMPLEX SENTENCES ARE COMPOSED OF SIMPLER PARTS

THE SORT OF EMPIRICISM IN THIS SECOND DOGMA IS CRUCIAL AND INTIMATELY CONNECTED TO THE FIRST DOGMA THE IDEA OF THIS SECOND DOGMA IS THAT FOR EACH MEANINGFUL SENTENCE THERE IS A RANGE OF CONFIRMATORY EXPERIENCE THAT VERIFIES ITS TRUTH IN LIGHT OF THIS SECOND DOGMA AN ANALYTIC SENTENCE IS JUST A LIMITING CASE WHERE ALL EXPERIENCE IS VACUOUSLY CONFIRMATORY IN FACT QUINE GOES SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THESE TWO DOGMAS ARE IDENTICAL AT ROOT

THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANALYTIC AND SYNTHETIC STATEMENTS IT IS MORE OF A BELIEF IN THEM

POINT IS MORE ACCURATELY THAT WE CAN'T GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE DISTINCTION IN A SUBSTANTIVE WAY NOT NECESSARILY THAT THERE IS NO DISTINCTION PERIOD THOUGH HE DOES PERSONALLY THINK THE DISTINCTION IS NONSENSE I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY IT IS MORE A BELIEF IN THEM

REDUCTIONISM IS NOT HOW MEANING IS FORMED I EAST IT IS RATHER THAT THERE IS A WEB OF BELIEFS WITH ALL SENTENCES IN IT

THIS IS CONFUSING TO PARSE PARTLY BECAUSE YOU MISUNDERSTOOD THE REDUCTIONISM THAT QUINE WAS TARGETING BEFORE TWO DOGMAS THE IDEA WAS THAT EACH MEANINGFUL SENTENCE BOILED DOWN TO TERMS THAT REFER TO IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCES I EAST EACH INDIVIDUAL SENTENCE TOUCHES EXPERIENCE AFTER TWO DOGMAS IDEA IS THAT SENTENCES ARE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER IN A WEB AND THE ENTIRE WEB ONLY TOUCHES EXPERIENCE AT THE EDGES INSTEAD OF EACH INDIVIDUAL SENTENCE TOUCHING EXPERIENCE BY ITSELF

THAT LEADS TO A MOVE TOWARD PRAGMATISM IT S NOT ABOUT PRETTY LOGIC BUT IF SOMETHING IS USEFUL TO BELIEVE IN

THIS IS A MISLEADING STATEMENT OF PRAGMATISM THE POINT HERE IS THAT WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING WHETHER A SENTENCE IS TRUE WE'RE ADJUSTING OUR ENTIRE WEB OF BELIEFS AND ADJUSTING OUR WEB OF BELIEFS INVOLVES CONSIDERING NOT JUST EXPERIENCE BUT OTHER THINGS LIKE SIMPLICITY EXPLANATORY BREADTH INTUITIVENESS ETC IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF CONSIDERING WHETHER IT'S USEFUL TO BELIEVE SOMETHING
THANK YOU THIS IS VERY INTERESTING
HILARY PUTNAM INTERPRETED QUINE AS HAVING REALLY ATTACKED THE A PRIORI A POSTERIORI DISTINCTION IN TWO DOGMAS

PUTNAM MOST VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO UNDERSTANDING QUINE WAS SAYING THAT SOME OF OUR BELIEFS ARE SO RESILIENT THAT NO SINGLE EXPERIENCE COULD DISCONFIRM THEM BUT NONE ARE SO RESILIENT THAT THEY COULD NOT BE GIVEN UP IF A BETTER THEORY AND NOT JUST A SINGLE EXPERIENCE COMES ALONG
YOU PRETTY MUCH GOT EVERYTHING WRONG

QUINE DOES NOT TAKE REDUCTIONISM IN THE SENSE YOU DEFINE IT HE EXPLICITLY SAYS IN THE ARTICLE REDUCTIONISM IS THE BELIEF THAT YOU CAN REDUCE MEANING TO METHODS OF EMPIRICAL VERIFICATION

THIS IS RELATED TO THE CONSEQUENCES THE BIGGEST CONSEQUENCE IS NOT THE BLURRING BETWEEN METAPHYSICS AND SCIENCE BUT THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANALYTIC AND SYNTHETIC STATEMENTS IS A DIFFERENCE IN DEGREE NOT KIND AGAIN BASICALLY A DIRECT QUOTE THE PRAGMATISM COMES IN BECAUSE IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF USEFULNESS AS TO WHAT BELIEFS WE CONSIDER CENTRAL AND SO LESS SUBJECT TO CHANGES AT THE PERIPHERY

I CAN ELABORATE AFTER CLASS

EDIT GRAMMAR
TOTALLY CLICKBAIT THE MECHANISM OF CONSCIOUSNESS DOESN'T IMPLY THAT THERE'S A HOMUNCULUS THERE TO EXPERIENCE IT TWO TOTALLY UNRELATED PROBLEMS
I DON'T THINK PHILOSOPHERS ARE TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM ANSWERING THE REAL PROBLEM OF EXPLAINING THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS I MEAN WHO OUT THERE IS SAYING THAT IT SEEMS LIKE A CLICKBAIT TITLE
EVERY CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE INVOLVES A VERY LARGE REDUCTION OF UNCERTAINTY AT ANY TIME WE HAVE ONE EXPERIENCE OUT OF VASTLY MANY POSSIBLE EXPERIENCES AND REDUCTION OF UNCERTAINTY IS WHAT MATHEMATICALLY WE MEAN BY INFORMATION

THIS STRUCK ME AS AN INTERESTING WAY TO DESCRIBE INFORMATION BUT I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH IT I WONDER IF ANYONE CAN ELABORATE ON IT BECAUSE IT'S CONFOUNDED BY MY UNDERSTANDING THAT INFORMATION CAN POTENTIALLY INCREASE UNCERTAINTY YOU CAN HAVE WRONG CERTAINTY ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN HAVE THAT CHANGED BY INFORMATION THAT REVEALS YOUR PREVIOUS FLAWS LIMITATIONS ETC BUT IN DOING SO LEAVES YOU IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE JUST MORE AWARE OF YOUR IGNORANCE




I MEAN DON'T WE MAKE EVERYTHING WE DON'T UNDERSTAND MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN IT REALLY IS
ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS THAT TALKS A LOT ABOUT THE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE IS A COLLECTION OF THE TEACHINGS OF ZEN MASTER HUANG PO CALLED ON THE TRANSMISSION OF MIND

I WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT SOME READERS OF R PHILOSOPHY THOUGHT OF HIS TEACHINGS

HE DISCUSSES A LOT ABOUT THE NATURE OF MIND THE NATURE OF SELF AND THE ABSURDITY OF USING THE MIND TO DISCOVER THE MIND

EDIT PDF
I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO ADD THAT PSYCHOLOGY HAS MADE CONSCIOUSNESS APPEAR IT FAR MORE SIMPLER THAN IT IS
CLICKBAIT TITLE MAY BE THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE AND THEN BACKS UP THE PREMISE WITH A VAST OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF TWO UNRELATED PROBLEMS AND LOGICAL LEAP THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION

AND THEN THE PUNCHLINE

WE ARE CONSCIOUS SELVES BECAUSE WE TOO ARE BEAST MACHINES SELF-SUSTAINING THAT CARE ABOUT THEIR OWN PERSISTENCE

OK YOU CAN'T END WITH WHAT YOUR FIRST SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND THEN HOPE NOBODY NOTICES THAT THERE IS ZERO SUBSTANTIATION OF THIS PREMISE IF IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE BEAST MACHINES THEN WHY ARE THE OTHER BEAST MACHINES AT LESSER DEGREES OF CONSCIOUSNESS

THE ENTIRE PREMISE THAT DESCARTES WORKED FROM IS THAT THE BEASTS LACK SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE THEREFORE THAT BEASTLINESS IS NO LONGER RELEVANT TO HUMANS EXCEPT FOR A STEPPING STONE TO WHAT WE ARE

REPLACE CONSCIOUSNESS WITH EYES OR LUNGS OR ANY OTHER HUMAN RELEVANT ADAPTATION AND YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM EQUALLY UNSOLVABLE PHOTONS EXISTED BEFORE EYES RIGHT SO HOW EXACTLY DID EYES COME TO BE THAT IS THE CENTRAL QUESTION

NOBODY WOULD ARGUE THAT A BEAST MACHINE IS DEVOID OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR SELF-AWARENESS WHO HAS FOLLOWED ANY SORT OF BIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH ALONG THESE LINES THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENED TO GO FROM THAT VOID TO THAT PARTIAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN FROM PARTIAL TO FULL AWARENESS

THE NEXT PHASE OF THIS IS COMBINED CONSCIOUSNESS VIA TECHNOLOGICAL EXTENSION WE WILL BE INTERCONNECTED TO THE POINT THAT WE WILL NOT FATHOM INDIVIDUALITY AS A GIVEN

A USELESS ARTICLE NO SINGULAR ENTITY IS CAPABLE OF OVERCOMPLICATING THIS ISSUE WHEN THEORIES ARE SIMPLY BEING POSTULATED AND TAKING AN ENTIRE GROUP OF MULTITUDES OF THEORIES AS AGGREGATE AND SAYING LOOK AT ALL THIS COMPLEXITY IS SILLY

NEVER MIND THE DIRECT THAT THIS IS JUST ONE MORE POORLY FORMED THEORY IN THE PILE THUS ADDING TO THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS MIGHT BE DOING


WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING TO ME ON THIS SUB I READ AN ARTICLE I GENUINELY FIND IT INTERESTING AND THEN I READ THE COMMENTS AND FIND OUT IT'S ALL BULLSHIT I HAVE NO IDEA OF WHO TO BELIEVE RENDERING THE ARTICLE UNCERTAIN TO THE POINT OF USELESSNESS AND REGRET WASTING TIME ON THE THING IN THE FIRST PLACE
DISAPPOINTING MORE PHILODRIVEL I THOUGHT THEY WOULD GO INTO HOW THE BRAIN CREATES AN INTERNAL MODEL OF THE WORLD AND OTHER PEOPLE AND TRIES DIFFERENT THINGS IN THIS MODEL TO MAKE CHOICES WHAT ARE THE LOOPS WHICH THINGS ARE IN THE DYNAMIC SUBCONSCIOUS WHEN YOU START QUOTING DESCARTES UNLESS YOU'RE MAPPING REALITY FLIES OUT THE WINDOW
THE ARTICLE JUST DOES A SLEIGHT OF HAND IGNORES THE HARD PROBLEM AS IT CALLS IT AND THEN DECLARES THAT THEIR FINDINGS ABOUT THE DOWNSTREAM PROCESSING ARE ALL THAT MATTERS IT DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION IT FORMULATES ITSELF IF WE ARE BEAST MACHINES THEN WHY DO WE WASTE ENERGY GENERATING A CONSCIOUSNESS AT ALL

IMO THE AUTHOR IS UNWILLING TO CONSIDER OTHER EXPLANATIONS THAN THE STRICTLY MATERIALISTIC THE BODY IS A MACHINE THE BRAIN IS A MACHINE PART AND CONSCIOUSNESS IS A PRODUCT OF THE BRAIN
IT MAY BE THAT POP PHILOSOPHY MIGHT HAVE MADE DAVID CHALMERS FAR MORE RELEVANT THAN HE ACTUALLY IS

BY THE WAY THAT HEADLINE IS A TRULY AWFUL CONSTRUCTION IT MAY BE THAT X MIGHT HAVE Y COULD IT BE MORE WEASELLY
CONSCIOUSNESS IS SIMPLE I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE RESULT OF A STRING OF MEMORIES AND EXPERIENCES REPLAYED IN OUR MINDS COUPLED WITH GREAT INTELLIGENCE CONSCIOUSNESS ARISES
THIS IS ONLY BEING UNVOTED BECAUSE IT HAS SCIENTISTS AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE TITLE
NEVER HAVE I BEEN SO INTRIGUED YET UNAMUSED AT THE SAME TIME

LIKE THINKING I SEE A CELEBRITY THEN REALIZING IT'S A WAX STATUE THEN SOME GUY IS LIKE THIS ISSSSS THE CELEBRITY

I HAD TO STOP

WHEN THEY SAY SCIENTISTS ARE MAKING IT MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT NEEDS TO BE ARE THEY REFERRING TO THE SCIENTISTS IN THIS ARTICLE OR THE WIZARDS MAYBE WERE THERE ANCIENT NATIVE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY WHAT DO THEY THINK

MAYBE I'M WRONG BECAUSE IT WAS SO BORING I COULDN'T EVEN READ THROUGH A WHOLE PARAGRAPH WITHOUT MY BRAIN REFUSING TO ABSORB IT LIKE STUDYING IN COLLEGE BUT THIS WHOLE THING FELT LIKE WHEN YOU ARE STARTING A PROJECT AND YOU HAVE ALL YOUR TOOLS AND MATERIALS OUT IN FRONT OF YOU IN A BIG MESS AND EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE OKAY WHERE DO WE START

I'LL TELL YOU WHERE YOU START YOU READ THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL AND THAT INSTRUCTION MANUAL THE BIBLE SNAKES CAN TALK IN THERE NOW YOU TELL ME ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT ABOUT SNAKES WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR THEM THEY CAN SPEAK SO THEY ARE HUMANS THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS

EQUAL RIGHTS FOR SNAKES

SCROLLING THROUGH COMMENTS I'M MYSTIFIED BY THE AMOUNT OF HATE THIS ARTICLE IS GETTING I FEEL IT DESERVES PROPS FOR ACTUALLY DESCRIBING SOME EMPIRICAL TESTS THAT SCIENTISTS ARE EMPLOYING TO QUANTIFY CONSCIOUSNESS IN A MEASURABLE WAY I FIND THIS TO BE MADDENINGLY LACKING IN MOST ARTICLES ON THE SUBJECT

THERE'S A LOT OF VITRIOL AIMED AT THE RAMBLINGS TOWARDS THE BEGINNING IF YOU STUDY PHILOSOPHY MAYBE THAT MAKES YOU RIGHTLY ANGRY HOWEVER I'M CURIOUS IF I JUST DON'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE FIELD THAT THE PHYSICAL TESTS INVOLVING TMR AND MEASURING THE MATHEMATICAL COMPLEXITY OF ECHOES EAST G IS SIMPLY OLD NEWS AND I'M ONLY FINDING IT INTERESTING SINE I HAVEN'T PAID ENOUGH ATTENTION

IF THAT'S THE CASE IF ANYONE KNOWS A LINK TO SOME SORT OF OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT METHODOLOGIES EMPLOYED IN QUANTIFYING CONSCIOUSNESS I'D BE VERY INTERESTED I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT VERY LITTLE TANGIBLE WORK WAS DONE IN THIS FIELD FOR REASONS
ISN'T THAT ARTICLE JUST SAYING THE PROBLEM IS WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS ANYWAY IE EXPLAINING HOW TO CONSTRUCT EACH ASPECT OF THIS ABSTRACT INNER SPACE OUT OF ORDINARY MATTER
THIS WAS NOT ALL THAT WELL WRITTEN REALLY OUR CONCIOUSNESS IS A SIDE EFFECT OF OUR BIOLOGY WHICH HAS EVOLVED TO BE THIS WAY AND WE KNOW OUR STATE TO NOT BE ANYTHING MORE THAN THE OUTCOME OF COUNTLESS RELATIVELY SMALL CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN OUR BRAIN WHICH CREATE COMPLEX THOUGHTS AS THEY ARE COMPOUNDED WITH EACHOTHER WHEN INTERPRETING EXTERNAL INPUT THE CONCIOUSNESS WE EXPERIENCE IS NOT REALITY THERE IS MUCH IN REALITY OUR BRAIN CANNOT INTERPRET AND THERE CAN BE ERRORS IN INTERPRETATION SUCH AS IN SYNTHESIS IE SMELLING THE COLOR BLUE OR HALLUCINATIONS WHICH SEEM JUST AS REAL AS INSTANCES WHERE EXTERNAL INPUT HAVE TRIGGERED THE COGNITIVE EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN FROM CHEMICAL ERROR OR ANOMALY PROVIDING EVIDENCE FOR THIS THEORY PHILOSOPHY OF MIND AND NEUROBIOLOGY AND SCIENCE SHOULD ALL ENHANCE ONE ANOTHER IN THE PURSUIT OF UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF OUR REALITY AND HOW THE NATURE OF OUR CONCIOUSNESS FITS WITHIN THAT REALITY IT'S BOTH A COMPLEX AND SIMPLE

I HAVE A SIMILAR THEORY FOR WHY WE EXPERIENCE THE FEELING OF FREE WILL EVEN THOUGH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN OUR MINDS MAKE DECISIONS BEFORE WE ARE COGNITIVELY AWARE OF THOSE DECISIONS IT IS ANOTHER SIDE EFFECT OF A USEFUL COGNITIVE FUNCTION FREE WILL IS EXPERIENCED IN ORDER TO HELP US BEHAVIORALLY ADAPT TO OUR EVER CHANGING ENVIRONMENT THE NEED TO REWARD OURSELVES FOR MAKING DECISIONS WITH POSITIVE OUTCOMES AND PUNISH OR BE MAD AT OURSELVES FOR BEHAVIORS THAT LEAD TO NEGATIVE OUTCOMES REQUIRES THE THOUGHT THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND HAVE FREE WILL WE ENGAGE IN THIS WAY OF THINKING EVEN IF THE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE OUTCOMES ACTUALLY HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH OUR OWN BEHAVIORS THIS WAY OF SELF ADJUSTING ALLOWS SUPPORT OF THE NERAL CONNECTIONS FOR EFFECTIVE BEHAVIORS AND A WEAKENING THE DETRIMENTAL ONES BASED ON USE FREQUENCY ALTHOUGH FREE WILL IS REAL IN THE SENSE THAT WE ALMOST ALL EXPERIENCE IT AND HOLD ONE ANOTHER ACCOUNTABLE BASED UPON THE WAY WE THINK OF OUR OWN DECISION MAKING BEING ABLE TO PROVE WE HAVE DECISION MAKING CAPACITY IE FREE WILL BEYOND OUR BIOLOGICAL AUTOMATIC RESPONSES IS NOT WITHIN OUR GRASP YET

THE MIND IS SIMULTANEOUSLY BOTH SIMPLE AND COMPLEX JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE LABELS THE WAY VARIOUS TYPES OF SCHOLARS PERSUE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
EXCITINGLY WE CAN NOW QUANTIFY THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE ECHOES BY WORKING OUT HOW COMPRESSIBLE THEY ARE SIMILAR TO HOW SIMPLE ALGORITHMS COMPRESS DIGITAL PHOTOS INTO JPEG FILES

RANDOM WHITE NOISE IS MORE COMPLEX THAN THE SISTINE CHAPEL
A SERIES OF STUDIES BY THE NEUROSCIENTIST MARCELLO MASSIMINI AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MILAN PROVIDES POWERFUL EVIDENCE FOR THIS VIEW IN THESE STUDIES THE BRAIN IS STIMULATED BY BRIEF PULSES OF ENERGY USING A TECHNIQUE CALLED TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION TMS AND ITS ELECTRICAL ECHOES ARE RECORDED USING EEG IN DREAMLESS SLEEP AND GENERAL ANAESTHESIA THESE ECHOES ARE VERY SIMPLE LIKE THE WAVES GENERATED BY THROWING A STONE INTO STILL WATER BUT DURING CONSCIOUS STATES A TYPICAL ECHO RANGES WIDELY OVER THE CORTICAL SURFACE DISAPPEARING AND REAPPEARING IN COMPLEX PATTERNS EXCITINGLY WE CAN NOW QUANTIFY THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE ECHOES BY WORKING OUT HOW COMPRESSIBLE THEY ARE SIMILAR TO HOW SIMPLE ALGORITHMS COMPRESS DIGITAL PHOTOS INTO JPEG FILES THE ABILITY TO DO THIS REPRESENTS A FIRST STEP TOWARDS A THAT IS BOTH PRACTICALLY USEFUL AND THEORETICALLY MOTIVATED
WELL I HAVE BEEN STUDYING K9 COGNITION AND WE ARE NOT AS FAR AHEAD OF OTHER ANIMALS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT WERE A LOT LESS SPECIAL THEN WE THOUGHT A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
YOU JUST NEED TO READ THE TITLE TO KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR SHOULD HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A WORD ABOUT PHILOSOPHY LEARN THE LANGUAGE FIRST YOU KANT
YEAH ITS JUST A BIOLOGICAL COMPUTER

WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT EVENTUALLY
THERE IS TOO MUCH MYSTERIANISM AND OBSCURANTISM LINGERING IN PHILOSOPHY TOO MUCH CHESS FOR THE SAKE OF EGO
THIS IS THE MOST PRETENTIOUS MEANINGLESS SHIT I'VE EVER READ
WHAT IS THIS GARBAGE WHY WOULD YOU POST THIS
R TITLEGORE
OR NOT

LOVE THAT TITLE
NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING PRAGMATICAL AND CROSS-DISCIPLINARY WHEN DEALING WITH REAL LIFE SO MANY THINKERS ARE DRAWN TO THE MYSTERIOUS SIDE AND NOT BOTHER WITH THE MESSY PARTS
ITS INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT IT FROM AN ENGINEERING STANDPOINT AS I PERCEIVED IT LIKE THE DATA GAINED FROM IT COULD HELP GIVE RISE TO A SINGULARITY MAYBE IT IS SIMPLER THAN WE THINK MAYBE WE JUST NEED TO TELL OUR AI SYSTEM TO DETERMINE WHAT FITNESS IS ON A SORT OF NOVELTY SYSTEM WHAT SYSTEM MODEL IT AFTER THE BRAINS REWARD SYSTEM JUST SOME RAMBLING
THATS A BIT OBVIOUS BECAUSE BOTH TYPES LOVE TO OVER THINK AND OVER ANALYZE THINGS TO THE POINT THAT IT BECOMES SUPER COMPLICATED ITS NATURAL CHING TO HAVE EVEN IN A I A I WILL NATURALLY LEARN THINGS OUT OF ITS OWN RIGHT AND EVENTUALLY START ASKING THE BIGGER QUESTIONS LIKE US HUMANS IS CONSCIOUSNESS A RELATIVE TERM I THINK SO
I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE ONESELF AS THE BEING RECOGNIZING ONESELF

BASICALLY BEING ABLE TO SAY THIS IS ME AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE IF I DO THIS WITH MYSELF IT HAPPENS
IT FEELS LIKE THE AUTHOR STATED WHAT THE EASY AND HARD PROBLEMS WERE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO SAY THAT THE HARD PROBLEM WAS THE SAME AS HIS THEORY FOR THE EASY PROBLEM AND CALL IT A DAY
THE DISTINCTION MADE BETWEEN THE REAL PROBLEM AND THE EASY PROBLEM IS DUMB ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THE EASY PROBLEM DO NOT ASSUME THE HARD PROBLEM DOESN'T EXIST
IT WITH NO ANTECEDENT FOLLOWED BY A REDUNDANT USE OF MIGHT AFTER MAY HAS ALREADY BEEN USED HALLMARKS OF A SCHOLARLY PUBLICATION
WHAT A PHILOSOPHY PAPER THAT DOESN'T READ LIKE A DECLARATION OF WAR ON SCIENCE
THE SHOCK COMES WHEN YOU REALIZE CONSCIOUSNESS IS LITTLE MORE THAN APPLIED GRAPH THEORY JUST WITH A PERVERSE NUMBER OF NODES
SO A COMPULSION TO REDUCE ALL DIFFERENCE AND UNEXPECTED EVENTS TO THE FAMILIAR IS WHAT THEN PRODUCES A WHETHER UNIFIED OR DIMENSIONAL SELF

MY NIETZSCHE NEURONS ARE FIRING
HAVING SKIMMED IT I THINK I LARGELY AGREE COOL TO SEE I BEGGED TO GET ONTO THE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF COGNITIVE SCIENCE AT THIS UNIVERSITY A DECADE AGO AND IT SPARKED MY OWN FORMULATION OF COMPLEXITY THEORY WITH WHICH THIS VIEW IS COMPATIBLE
MAYBE ITS LIKE AN INFINITE LOOP OF MIRRORS WHEN WE TRY TO THINK ABOUT THINKING WE CAN GO ON FOREVER FIGURING OUT WHAT IT IS AND NEVER GET ANY CLOSET TO AN ANSWER WHEN REALLY ALL CONSCIOUSNESS IS IS THE ABILITY TO THINK ABOUT THOUGHT
SO CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS JUST LIKE DR FREUD HAD SAID OUCH STOP HITTING ME
DOESN'T THIS JUST ADD ANOTHER LEVEL OF COMPLICATION
YEAH ABOUT THAT
WITHOUT WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT EXPLAINING

WELL OK THAT'LL TAKE THE MYSTERY OUT LITERALLY ANYTHING
OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS PURE ENERGY FROM GOD
YEAH I THINK THAT AT THE HEART OF IT ALL YOUR CONSCIENCE IS REALLY SAYING IS WHAT
DOWN WITH
SCIENCE HEY THERE PHILOSOPHY MY BUD BUD READY TO TAKE A BACK SEAT YET

PHILOSOPHY NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN THERE SCIENCE

SCIENCE YOU KNOW LIKE JUST GROUND ALL YOUR THEORETICAL STARING POINTS IN MY KNOWLEDGE

PHILOSOPHY TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE YOU MUST HAVE CERTAINTY MY FRIEND BY THAT STANDARD I GUESS I KNOW NOTHING

SURE CONSCIENCE IS SO TRIVIAL
HUMANS MAKE THINGS MORE COMPLICATED THAN THEY HAVE TO BE IT'S OUR SHTICK
SEEMS TO BE ALOT OF ARTICLES POSTED FROM RECENTLY
I THINK IF SOMEONE CLAIMS THAT HE UNDERSTANDS CONSCIOUSNESS HE SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN RELATED QUESTIONS

DOES A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT PASSES THE TURING TEST HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS OR SIMILAR AI RELATED QUESTIONS
2 WHAT IS THE MOST PRIMITIVE ANIMAL THAT HARBORS CONSCIOUSNESS OR ANIMAL RELATED QUESTIONS

DOES THE APPROACH IN THE ARTICLE BRING US NEARER TO ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS

I'D SAY IT'S PRAGMATIC TO ASSUME THINGS HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE QUESTION HOW MY CONSCIOUSNESS IS CONNECTED TO MY BODY AND WHY
IS IT JUST ME OR WAS THE CONCEPT OF SELF BARELY ADDRESSED

THAT IS THE REAL MEAT OF THE QUESTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS ISN'T IT

INTERESTING ARTICLE THOUGH I'LL READ THE LINKED RESEARCH TOO THANKS
I GUESS THAT WE CAN REDUCE CONSCIOUSNESS TO MATTER AFTER ALL NOW THAT WE HAVE ADDED A SMALL DEGREE OF COMPLEXITY TO OUR ACCOUNT OF THE RELEVANT MATTER GEE WHIZ WHY DIDN'T ANYONE THINK OF THIS BEFORE
I READ THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS HERE AND I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT THE PHILOSOPHICAL COMMUNITY HASN'T BEEN LISTENING TO RECENT PROGRESS IN AI AND THE LIGHT IT SHEDS ON THE PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS HENCE THE RESPONSES WE GET HERE

THE ARTICLE SAYS

THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH I LIKE TO CALL THE REAL PROBLEM HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS WITHOUT PRETENDING IT DOESN T EXIST EASY PROBLEM AND WITHOUT WORRYING TOO MUCH ABOUT EXPLAINING ITS EXISTENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE HARD PROBLEM

WE CAN DO MORE THAN THEORIZE ABOUT HOW VISION HEARING SPEECH LOCOMOTION AND GRASPING WORK WE CAN MAKE A WORKING VISION SYSTEM WITH ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS THAT ACTUALLY CAN SEE ALMOST AS WELL AS HUMANS TRANSCRIBE SPEECH INTO TEXT WITH HUMAN ACCURACY PARSE TEXT AND EXTRACT MEANING EVEN REASON OVER TEXT AND TRANSLATE TEXT INTO A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE DON'T SAY GOOGLE TRANSLATE IS SHIT IT'S NOT BLEEDING EDGE BETTER TRANSLATION SYSTEMS EXIST IN THE LABS THAT ARE TOO EXPENSIVE TO BE DEPLOYED EN MASSE

I AM SAYING THAT WE CAN REIMPLEMENT ONE BY ONE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN AND WE ARE CURRENTLY TACKLING THE BEHAVIOR LEARNING PART ALPHAGO AND OTHER REINFORCEMENT LEARNING SYSTEMS MASTERING THAT PART WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE ARTIFICIAL AGENTS OR CONSCIOUS

SO WHILE PHILOSOPHERS STILL DEBATE DUALISM MONISM AND ONTOLOGY OVER HERE NEURAL NETWORK GUYS CAN ACTUALLY RECREATE MOST OF THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS AND IN THE PROCESS GET AMAZING INSIGHTS INTO WHAT THE BRAIN IS ACTUALLY DOING

I THINK THERE IS A LOT TO GAIN FROM AT LEAST ADOPTING THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PARADIGM FOR STUDYING CONSCIOUSNESS IN RL AN AGENT EMBEDDED IN AN ENVIRONMENT LEARNS TO BEHAVE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE ITS REWARDS SEE HOW I NEVER NEEDED TO USE CONSCIOUSNESS HERE

IT GOES TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS FOR IT IS FOR MAXIMIZING REWARDS WHAT ARE THE REWARDS REWARDS SIGNALS ARE BIOLOGICALLY HARDWIRED INTO US AND CONTAIN A SMALL SET OF CHANNELS RELATED TO EATING SHELTER SOCIALIZING REPRODUCTION UNDERSTANDING AND CREATIVITY

CONSCIOUSNESS IS TAKING CARE OF THESE REWARDS WE CAN REPLACE CONSCIOUSNESS WITH THIS PERCEPTION ACTION SELECTION ACTION LOOP PUTTING IT SQUARELY IN A DOMAIN THAT WE CAN TREAT MATHEMATICALLY

FIRST ESSENTIAL STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF LEARNING ANY SUBJECT IS TO FIND PRINCIPLES OF NUMERICAL RECKONING AND PRACTICABLE METHODS FOR MEASURING SOME QUALITY CONNECTED WITH IT LORD KELVIN

THE AGENT LEARNS HOW TO MAKE USEFUL INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE EXTERNAL REALITY IT LEARNS WHICH STATES ARE GOOD AND WHICH ARE BAD AND HOW TO GO FROM BAD TO GOOD STATES IT UPDATES ITS BEHAVIORS WITH TIME AS REWARDS TEACH IT

THE SYSTEM IS A CONTINUOUS LOOP AGENT PERCEIVES SELECTS A BEHAVIOR AND THEN ACTS IT OUT ON THE ENVIRONMENT THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGES OR THE AGENT'S POSITION IN THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGES THIS SPORADICALLY PRODUCES REWARD SIGNALS REWARDS SIGNALS ARE USED TO UPDATE BEHAVIOR

THERE IS NO EXPLICIT CONSCIOUSNESS FUNCTION IN RL THERE IS A PERCEPTION MODULE THAT DOES ABOUT THE SAME THING AS AN IMAGE AUDIO RECOGNITION NEURAL NET LEARNING HAPPENS BOTH AT THE PERCEPTION STAGE AND AT THE BEHAVIORAL STAGE WE DON'T NEED TO ANALYZE CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE SOFT HARD PROBLEM DICHOTOMY ANY MORE IF WE CAN MAKE AGENTS THAT ACT CONVINCINGLY LIKE US ESPECIALLY THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY DO IT

YES BUT YOU MIGHT SAY DOES IT ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE SOMETHING TO BE AN RL AGENT I'D SAY IT DOES FEEL LIKE SOMETHING THE AGENT IS PARTICULARLY AWARE OF ITS STATE AND THE VALUE ITS STATE HAS ANY STATE THE AGENT IS IN FEELS LIKE SOMETHING WE CAN ALREADY EMBED WORDS INTO LINEAR SPACES WHERE MEANING IS CAPTURED IN THE COORDINATES AN AGENT CONSTRUCTS THIS INTERNAL STATE WHILE LEARNING TO REPRESENT EXTERNAL SENSATIONS THIS INTERNAL STATE IS THE SPACE OF QUALIA CONTAINING ALL POSSIBLE QUALIA THE AGENT CAN HAVE

ANALOGICALLY IT IS LIKE REPRESENTING COLOR AS A TRIPLET R G B THE SPACE OF ALL POSSIBLE RGB VALUES IS THE SPACE OF COLOR QUALIA IN THIS CASE WE USED ONLY DIMENSIONS TO CREATE A QUALIA SPACE FOR ALL POSSIBLE COLORS BASED ON THIS PROJECTION OF COLOR INTO NUMERICAL SPACE WE CAN PROCESS COLOR WITH NEURAL NETS

AGENT EMOTION IS RELATED TO THE VALUE OF THE STATE DOES IT REPRESENT SOMETHING THAT WOULD GIVE REWARDS OR NOT THAT IS THE ROOT OF HUMAN EMOTION MAXIMIZING REWARDS QUALIA IS A DISENTANGLED STATE SPACE INTO WHICH ALL EXTERNAL SENSATIONS ARE REPRESENTED DURING PERCEPTION RL IS A SPECIAL KIND OF LEARNING THAT ASSIGNS CREDIT TO USEFUL ACTIONS WE DON'T NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT ALL IN MYSTICAL MYSTERIOUS TERMS

WHICH IS BASICALLY THE PREMISE OF THE ARTICLE AND WHY IT GETS BASHED IT DARES TO SAY WE CAN TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE BRAIN PROCESSES DIRECTLY INSTEAD OF PHILOSOPHIZING ABOUT IT THE ARTICLE ENDS ON A FUNDAMENTAL POINT

WE ARE CONSCIOUS SELVES BECAUSE WE TOO ARE BEAST MACHINES SELF SUSTAINING FLESH BAGS THAT CARE ABOUT THEIR OWN PERSISTENCE

ALL THIS IS TO ENSURE PERSISTENCE AND SELF REPLICATION WHICH IS ANOTHER KIND OF PERSISTENCE
THE REQUIREMENTS OF SELF PERSISTENCE LEAD TO CONSCIOUSNESS IN ANIMALS

CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SELF REPLICATING PERSISTENCE MAXIMIZER



HEIDEGGER AND MERLEAU-PONTY READ THEM
WELL THAT WAS A LOTTA HOOEY
THOUGHT THIS WAS A TITLE FOR R SHOWERTHOUGHTS
DELETED
IF A COMPUTER IS A DEVICE THAT PERFORMS COMPUTATION THEN WHAT IS COMPUTATION

YOU COULD SAY THAT COMPUTATION IS WHAT COMPUTERS DO BUT THEN THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT COMPUTATIONAL SCHEMES KINDS OF COMPUTERS THAT CAN ALL DO ANY PARTICULAR COMPUTATION

THIS FACT SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THERE IS SOME DEEPER UNDERLYING COMMONALITY BETWEEN WHAT ALL THOSE DIFFERENT SORTS OF COMPUTERS ARE DOING WHEN THEY'RE DOING THE SAME COMPUTATION IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS

IS THERE A WAY TO PRECISELY SPECIFY THAT COMMONALITY
BLURB

ON SEPTEMBER 10TH NINA EMERY GAVE THIS INTRODUCTORY LEVEL TALK ON THE TOPIC OF PHYSICS FREEDOM AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY AT DEPAUW UNIVERSITY THIS TALK WAS A PART OF THE YOUNG PHILOSOPHERS LECTURE SERIES HOSTED BY THE JANET PRINDLE INSTITUTE FOR ETHICS AND THE DEPAUW PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT

SPEAKER

NINA EMERY ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY BROWN UNIVERSITY
I CAN'T LISTEN TO PODCASTS BUT I LOVE THEORY OF FREE WILLIAM I ALWAYS REGRETTED NOT LIVING AMONG THE WHERE PHILOSOPHERS HAD CRAZY ALL-ENCOMPASSING IDEAS EVERYTHING IS WATER AARONSON SHOWS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE JUST AS AMBITIOUS

HE BELIEVES THAT FREE WILL AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE A RESULT OF OUR BRAINS INTERACTING WITH PARTICLES FROM THE BIG BANG THAT HAVE NOT INTERACTED WITH ANY OTHER PARTICLE THE PROPERTIES OF THESE PARTICLES ARE THERE NEW TO THE UNIVERSE AS NO OTHER PARTICLE HAS SEEN THEM BEFORE AS THE SUPPLY OF FREE PARTICLES DECREASES SO WILL FREE WILL AND CONSCIOUSNESS I SUPPOSE THIS COULD BE TESTED IN THE SHORT TERM BY PUTTING SOMEONE DEEP INSIDE ENOUGH MATERIAL THAT FREE PARTICLES ARE BLOCKED IN THEORY THIS WOULD PREVENT THEM HAVE FREE WILL AND 2 BEING CONSCIOUS

I LOVE THE IDEA BECAUSE IT IS SO UNREASONABLE AND DIFFERENT FROM OTHER APPROACHES
PERHAPS YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME EXPLANATION OF THE TRAIN CASE SO THAT WE MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE SHIP CASE SOME OF US MYSELF INCLUDED HAVEN'T WORKED WITH SAUSSURE

TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT IT WOULD AT FIRST APPEAR THAT IN THE CASE OF THE EXPRESS SAUSSURE IS READING OFF FEATURES OF A PREEXISTING SOCIAL PRACTICE THE WAY IN WHICH WE INTERACT WITH TRAIN LINES MAKES CERTAIN FEATURES MORE IMPORTANT TO US AND OTHERS LESS SO WE TYPICALLY CARE ABOUT THE TIME AND STOPS NOT THE STAFF LIST WE LET THE UNIMPORTANT FEATURES IS WE WORK WITH A PARTICULAR ABSTRACTION OF THE TRAIN WHICH SAUSSURE IS READY TO REPORT BACK TO US

BUT WHAT IS THE SHIP OF THESEUS SOCIAL PRACTICE DO PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THE SHAPE RATHER THAN THE HISTORY OF ITS MATERIAL OR DO THEY TREASURE ITS ORIGINAL PLANKS LIKE PIECES OF THE TRUE CROSS WOULDN'T WE HAVE TO KNOW THIS BEFORE WE COME TO ANY CONCLUSION ABOUT THE NETWORK OF DIFFERENCES AMOUNTS TO AND IN TURN WHAT THE WORD MEANS
LAW IF SOMETHING HAS ALL THE SAME PROPERTIES IT IS THE SAME OBJECT

THEREFORE IF WE CONSIDER EACH PLANK OF WOOD TO BE A PROPERTY THEN THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SIMILARLY IF THE ONLY PROPERTIES WE CARE ABOUT ARE RELATIONAL THEN IT IS THE SAME

THE ISSUE IS THAT TIME AND SPACE OR MORE ACCURATELY WHERE THE OBJECTS EXISTS IN TIME-SPACE ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED PART OF THE OBJECT THE APPLE ON THE LEFT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE APPLE ON THE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY OCCUPY DIFFERENT SPACE EVEN IF THEY ARE OTHERWISE IDENTICAL IN THIS WAY THE TRAIN FROM A TO B IS A DIFFERENT TRAIN AT EVERY SECOND AND AT EVERY NEW LOCATION WHICH IS ALWAYS THE SHIP OF THESEUS THUS POSSES A PROBLEM EVEN IF THE BOARDS ARE NEVER REPLACED THOUGH THIS CAN BE A USEFUL ADDITION TO THE PROBLEM TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM THE FIRST TIME
THESEUS SHIP OCCUPIES A TON OF FUNCTIONAL ROLES IN A TON OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THOUGH IT IS THE THING OCCUPYING A CERTAIN BERTH AT THE DOCK IT IS THE THING THAT A BUNCH OF BARNACLES CALL HOME IT IS THE THING THAT JIM USES AS A LANDMARK TO FIND HIS WAY HOME ETC ETC THE BLOG POST ONLY CONSIDERS THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF THE THING OWNED BY SO-AND-SO

SO TAKE HOBBES VERSION OF THE PARADOX AS EACH PLANK IS REPLACED SOMEONE COLLECTS THE ORIGINAL AND SLOWLY REBUILDS THE SHIP WITH ALL THE ORIGINAL PLANKS SO NOW THERE'S TWO SHIPS AND IF EACH ONE FULFILLS SOME OF THE SAME FUNCTIONAL ROLES IN THE SAME SYSTEMS AS THE ORIGINAL THEN THE IDENTITY QUESTION GETS REALLY COMPLICATED NOT NECESSARILY CONTRADICTORY BECAUSE YOU COULD INSIST THAT THERE ARE AS MANY SHIPS OF THESEUS AS THERE ARE SYSTEMS THEY PARTICIPATE IN BUT THEN THIS SOLUTION IS NOT DOING AWAY WITH METAPHYSICAL PUZZLES RATHER IT SEEMS TO BE MAKING THEM WORSE

FIRST THE WEBSITE LAYOUT IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD THE ENTIRE LEFT HALF OF THE SCREEN IS JUST THE TITLE IMO SOMEONE ONLY DESIGNED IT TO BE READ ON A PHONE AND NEVER CHECKED HOW IT LOOKS ON A DESKTOP CHANGING THE LAYOUT SO THAT ONLY ABOUT THE TITLE TAKES UP ONLY OF THE LEFT WILL MAKE IT LOOK A LOT BETTER

NOW BACK TO PHILOSOPHY YOUR SOLUTION VERY CLEANLY SOLVES THE CASE WHERE THE SHIP IS TORN DOWN AND PUT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AS IT PRESERVES OUT INTUITION OF CONTINUITY THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXTRAPOLATE HOW IT DEALS WITH THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NOW TWO SHIPS INSTEAD OF ONE TO MY UNDERSTANDING THIS REASONING WOULD LEAD TO BOTH SHIPS BEING WHICH I'M ADMITTEDLY PARTIAL TOWARDS
BLURB AT THE HEART OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT WAS THE NOTION THAT THE WORLD COULD IN PRINCIPLE BE EXPLAINED YET PERPLEXINGLY THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS SEEM TO DEFY EXPLANATION IS EXPLANATION AN ILLUSION OR DOES IT FUNCTION DIFFERENTLY THAN WE SUPPOSE OR IN OUR POSTMODERN WORLD ARE ANSWERS STILL POSSIBLE AFTER ALL

SPEAKERS FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE APA S PACIFIC DIVISION NANCY CARTWRIGHT PHILOSOPHER OF PHYSICS JAMES LADEMAN AND OUTSPOKEN METEOROLOGIST PIERS CORBAN

CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE ARGUMENT IN SIMPLER WORDS
PREFERABLY SOMEONE WHO AGREES WITH LUCAS

I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM BUT I DON'T KNOW AT WHICH POINT HE WENT WRONG BECAUSE IT'S TOO CONFUSING FOR ME

WHAT QUESTION WOULD LUCAS ASK IN A TURING TEST THAT ONLY A MIND COULD ANSWER

OF COURSE THERE ARE MATHEMATICAL LOGICAL PROBLEMS THAT MOST HUMANS CAN'T SOLVE BUT AS I UNDERSTOOD LUCAS THERE ARE PROBLEMS THAT SOME HUMANS SOME MALE COULD ANSWER BUT NO MACHINES
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT HE IS TOO NARROW-MINDED AND THINKS THAT ALL PROGRAMS ARE DEDUCTION MACHINES LIKE EAST G PROLOG PROGRAMS

I THINK HE ARGUED AGAINST THAT BUT I LIKE TO ADD THAT PROLOG IS WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN WRITE ANY PROGRAM THAT YOU COULD WRITE WITH ANOTHER LANGUAGE ALSO IN PROLOG
HAVING READ THE PAPER AND SOME OTHER COMMENTARY I HAVE A COMMENT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PEOPLE MAKING ERRORS AS LUCAS QUITE POLITICALLY INCORRECTLY PUTS IT

ARE NOT MEN INCONSISTENT TOO CERTAINLY WOMEN ARE AND POLITICIANS AND EVEN MALE CONTRADICT THEMSELVES SOMETIMES AND A SINGLE INCONSISTENCY IS ENOUGH TO MAKE A SYSTEM INCONSISTENT

LUCAS SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM IF WE LET THE MACHINE OR PERSON CORRECT THEMSELVES A FALLIBLE BUT SELF-CORRECTING MACHINE WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO RESULTS

A NATURAL MODEL OF SELF CORRECTION IS THAT A FORMULA IS CONSIDERED TRUE BY A PERSON MACHINE IF IT IS ASSENTED TO AT SOME TIME T AND NOT DISSENTED FROM AT A LATER TIME THIS CAPTURES IDEA THAT WE ESCHEW INCONSISTENCIES WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE

THE DOWNSIDE OF THIS DEFINITION IS THAT THE SET OF TRUE FORMULAS OF THIS SYSTEM ARE NOT ROYAL EAST CONSIDER ENUMERATION OF ALL UNIVERSAL ARITHMETIC SENTENCES AND AN ENUMERATION OF ALL EXISTENTIAL SENTENCES NATURAL NUMBER PAIRS WE ASSERT THE UNIVERSAL SENTENCE I AT TIME 2 I AND CHECK THE EXISTENTIAL SENTENCE J TO SEE IF K IS A WITNESS AT TIME 2 J K EVERY TRUE EXISTENTIAL IS EVENTUALLY ASSERTED SO ONLY THE TRUE UNIVERSALS ARE LEFT ASSERTED AND NOT LATER DENIED THUS WE HAVE EXACTLY THE TRUE SENTENCES WITH A SINGLE QUANTIFIER A EAST SET
THIS SEEMS SO OBVIOUS OF COURSE IF ALL YOU'RE READING IS THEORY YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON EXPLORING THE WAYS DIFFERENT MINDSETS CAN IMPACT YOUR RELATIONSHIPS OR LIFESTYLES OR WHATEVER WHICH IS WHAT FICTION SERVES TO PROVIDE A PEEK INTO A DIFFERENT MODE OF BEING

IT'S TRICKY FINDING LITERATURE THAT ACTUALLY REFLECTS ACCENTUATES DRAMATIZES PHILOSOPHIC CONCEPTS SPECIFICALLY LIKE SAMUEL DELANY IS EXEMPLARY AND MILAN KUNDERA BORGES CERTAINLY THOUGH THEY ALL TEND TO ZIGZAG ACROSS THE BOUNDARY OF FICTION THEORY
AT A SKIM I READ THAT AS WHY PHILOSOPHY NEEDS INTERVIEW WITH DICE CLAY THAT WOULD REALLY BRING A LOT OF FRESH IDEAS TO THE PHILOSOPHY WORLD

I MAY BE COMPLETELY MISINTERPRETING THINGS BUT IN WHAT SENSE IS GOOD EVEN MORE SPECIFICALLY SHE WANTS PHILOSOPHY TO MINIMIZE IMPLICIT BIAS BY USING THINKING HOW DOES THAT SENTENCE EVEN BEGIN TO MAKE SENSE BIAS IS THINKING THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF BIAS YOU CANNOT MINIMIZE BIAS BY INTRODUCING MORE BIAS
VERY INTERESTING AND I AGREE ON MOST EXCEPT FOR 2 AND I DON'T THINK TRUMP IS A FASCIST
IS VERY ELITIST
AN ANALYSIS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION VIA WORK WOULD BE MORE ILLUMINATING OBAMA HAS HAD YEARS IN POWER INCLUDING THE FIRST FEW YEARS WITH A COMPLIANT CONGRESS THAT PASSED A MASSIVE OVERHAUL OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT FITS DEFINITION OF TOTALITARIAN

TOTALITARIAN MOVEMENTS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM AUTOCRATIC REGIMES SAYS ARENDT INSOFAR AS AUTOCRATIC REGIMES SEEK ONLY TO GAIN ABSOLUTE POLITICAL POWER AND TO OUTLAW OPPOSITION WHILE TOTALITARIAN REGIMES SEEK TO DOMINATE EVERY ASPECT OF EVERYONE'S LIFE
WIKI

TRUMP IN CONTRAST IS LIKELY TO LOSE THE ELECTION TO HILLARY WHO HAS FURTHER TOTALITARIAN LEANINGS EAST G CLOSING A WAGE GAP NATIONALIZED JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS
I THINK THE LINK MAY BE BROKEN
THE GENETIC ARGUMENT IS BASED ON THE PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLE EX NIHIL NIHIL FIT NOTHING CAN BRING ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH IT DOES NOT ALREADY POSSESS IF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS CAME TO BE THROUGH A PHYSICAL PROCESS OF EVOLUTION THEN PHYSICAL MATTER MUST ALREADY CONTAIN SOME BASIC FORM OF MENTAL BEING

ISN'T THIS EASILY DISMISSABLE THINK OF ANY FEATURE ON A CREATURE EYES LUNGS WHATEVER

THEY'RE JUST COMBINATIONS OF MATTER THAT RESPOND TO OTHER COMBINATIONS OF MATTER THE RECEPTOR FOR AN OUTPUT

I THINK IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT EYES DIDN'T ALWAYS EXIST BUT PERHAPS A SINGULAR PHYSICAL ENTITY DID THAT SPLIT INTO 2 PARTS ONE PART TO SEE AND ONE TO BE SEEN BY CAN YOU HAVE A ONE-SIDED COIN

ALONG THOSE LINES CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN EVENTUAL COMBINATION THAT HAS A SIMPLE ORIGIN EXTENDING FROM AN INCREASE IN COMPLEXITY OTHER THINGS HAVE IT JUST AT A SMALLER INTERVAL OR BANDWIDTH

THE NEXT ITERATION HUMAN EVOLUTION VIA TECHNOLOGICAL EXTENSION WILL HAVE MODIFICATIONS TO THAT CONSCIOUSNESS TO BE A LITERAL HIVE MIND TO THE POINT THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FATHOM WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN WE WERE DISCONNECTED INDIVIDUALS


WELL EVERYTHING IS JUST AN ACCIDENT OF THE UNIVERSE IF WE ACCEPT THE ARTICLE'S IMPLICIT DEFINITION LOL
MIND IS NOT ACCIDENT IT IS A RESPONSE IT IS A NATURAL OCCURRING PHENOMENON IN THIS UNIVERSE IT WOULD BE WISER TO ASSUME THAT SOMETHING IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR MILLIONS BILLIONS TRILLIONS OF TIMES AND NOT ONCE IN A RARE OCCURRENCE
WHY ARE THESE THINGS WRITTEN THE WAY THEY ARE I MAY NOT BE THE SMARTEST COOKIE FROM THE CUTTER BUT I HAVE A FAIRLY FIRM GRASP OF ENGLISH AND HAD TO READ THIS SEVERAL TIMES TO EVEN UNDERSTAND IT THE IDEAS COULD HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED FAR MORE INTUITIVELY USING PLAIN ENGLISH INSTEAD OF THIS OVERLY FORMAL GRANDIOSE NONSENSE

TURNS OUT HAVING DECIPHERED THE JARGON THAT THIS IS MENTAL MASTURBATION ISN'T IT YES IT MAY BE TRUE THAT CONSCIOUSNESS MAY BE UNIVERSAL IN SOME WAY BUT THIS ARTICLE SAYS LITTLE MORE THAN THAT

THE COMMENTS ON THE THREAD BY SOMEPERSON INPUT AND EQLERIQ ARE FAR MORE SALIENT CONCISE AND INTERESTING THAN THE ARTICLE ITSELF REDDIN IS A STRANGE PLACE
A REDUCTIVE WORLD-VIEW LEAVES THE MIND LACKING ANY PURPOSE

WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM OTHER THAN THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND IT DEPRESSING
PANPSYCHISM EXPLAINS NOTHING MIGHT AS WELL JUST SAY MATERIALISM IS INCOMPLETE AND THAT MIND EXCEEDS THE MATERIAL FRAME
I'M DEEPLY DISTURBED ABOUT THE FACT THAT I'M AGREEING WITH THIS I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY YES MOST OTHER PHYSICAL MATTERS AND I ARE MADE OF THE SAME STUFF BUT I KNOW THEY'RE NOT CONSCIOUS

CONSCIOUSNESS TAKES A COMPLEX ARRANGEMENT OF THE SAME ATOMS THAT WE CARRY IT'S LIKE PUTTING TOGETHER A MILLION PIECE PUZZLE YES WE HAVE THE SAME PIECES BUT YOU NEED TO PUT THEM IN A SPECIFIC ORDER COINCIDENTALLY TO GET THE PICTURE
BASED ON THIS COMMENTS SECTION ALL SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE A PHILOSOPHY OF MIND COURSE SO MUCH REDUCTIVE MATERIALISTIC NONSENSE IN HERE
WHAT IF THE UNIVERSE IS AN ACCIDENT OF THE MIND
I'M SURPRISED NOBODY HAS MENTIONED HOW RARE IT IS FOR AN ACTUAL CELL TO APPEAR AS WE KNOW IT ON THIS PLANET THE EVOLUTION OF MITOCHONDRIA ITSELF IS FASCINATING AND WHEN YOU REALIZE HOW RARE IT IS JUST FOR THAT TO HAPPEN YOU BEGIN TO APPRECIATE LIFE A LITTLE BIT MORE
ON THE ONE HAND PANPSYCHISM BRIDGES THE MODERN EPISTEMOLOGICAL GAP BETWEEN THE SUBJECT OF EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCED OBJECT THE LATTER OF WHOSE INTRINSIC NATURE IS UNKNOWN TO US PANPSYCHIST CLAIM THAT WE KNOW THE INTRINSIC NATURE OF MATTER BECAUSE WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT THROUGH OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS FREYA MATHEWS ARGUES IN HER FOR THE LOVE OF MATTER

THE MATERIALIST VIEW OF THE WORLD THAT IS A COROLLARY OF DUALISM MAROONS THE EPISTEMIC SUBJECT IN THE SMALL IF CHARMED CIRCLE OF ITS OWN SUBJECTIVITY AND THAT IT IS ONLY THE REANIMATION OF MATTER ITSELF THAT ENABLES THE SUBJECT TO RECONNECT WITH REALITY THIS ARGUMENT FROM REALISM CONSTITUTES MY DEFENSE OF PANPSYCHISM MATHEWS

ON THE OTHER HAND PANPSYCHISM PAINTS A PICTURE OF REALITY THAT EMPHASIZES A HUMANE AND CARING RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE DUE TO ITS FUNDAMENTAL REJECTION OF THE CARTESIAN CONCEPTION OF NATURE AS A MECHANISM TO BE EXPLOITED BY MANKIND FOR THE PANPSYCHIST WE ENCOUNTER IN NATURE OTHER ENTITIES OF INTRINSIC VALUE RATHER THAN OBJECTS TO BE MANIPULATED FOR OUR GAIN

THIS IS ASTOUNDINGLY FUZZY THINKING FOR BEING PUBLISHED ON PHILOSOPHYOFBRAINS
THAT PAINTING IS BEAUTIFUL
IF IT IS AN ACCIDENT THEN THE ARGUMENT OF MULTIPLE UNIVERSES OR INFINITE DIMENSIONS GROWS STRONGER
LET'S SAY WE ARE ONE OF MANY BUBBLES SURROUNDED BY MANY MORE LIKE A HUGE LOTTERY
OUR UNIVERSE SO FAR HAS ONE KNOWN WINNER FOR THE MIND IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM
THOSE MANY OTHER BEINGS WHO HAVEN'T ACCIDENTALLY DEVELOPED SELF CONSCIOUS MINDS SIMPLY CAN'T
ASK THIS QUESTION THEREFORE WE FEEL SPECIAL WE ASK WHY AM I NOT EXISTING SOMEWHERE ELSE
WHY AM I SO LUCKY TO BE A HUMAN ON EARTH IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE MIND TO ASK THIS QUESTION
OTHERWISE YOU WOULDN'T EXIST HERE IN A LARGE UNIVERSE OR ESPECIALLY IN MULTIPLE UNIVERSES THERE MUST
BE ENOUGH PROBABILITY FOR OTHER MINDS TO HAVE DEVELOPED A CONSCIOUSNESS BY CHANCE EVENTS
THEY TOO WONDER ABOUT THE SAME QUESTIONS
THIS ARTICLE JUST SEEMS TO BE MORE PSEUDO SCIENCE ARGUING FOR THE MIND BEING A ENTITY IE SPIRITUAL

THE SIMPLE FACT THAT WE CAN TAKE DRUGS THAT MODIFY OUR THOUGHTS PROVES THAT OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS PURELY PHYSICAL

DUALISM IS RELIGIOUS NONSENSE PANPSYCHISM TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT UNIVERSE HAS SOME SORT OF UNDERLYING CONSCIOUSNESS THERE'S NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT I THINK IT MAKES SENSE THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS A NATURAL PRODUCT OF THE UNIVERSE AND PROBABLY HAS OCCURRED MANY TIMES IN THE PAST PRESENT AND ONWARDS INTO THE FUTURE
ACCIDENT INCIDENT
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS BUT I WANT TO WANK A BANANA
HOW ARE WE DEFINING CONCIOUSNESS
I THINK OF IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND
PROBABLY NOT CONSIDERING AN ACCIDENT IS A CONCEPT CREATED BY THE HUMAN MIND SO IS TIME
THE MIND IS NOT AN ACCIDENT IT'S JUST A WAY FOR THE UNIVERSE TO MAKE SENCE OF ITSELF
REMINDME HOURS
I SO WANT TO SIT DOWN WITH CHALMERS AND HASH OUT HOW THIS ALL PLAYS OUT

WHAT IF INDIGENOUS AMERICANS WERE CORRECT THIS WHOLE TIME AND EARTH IS CONSCIOUS BOY SHE MUST BE PISSED RIGHT NOW

NOD APL

BUFFALO NATION

EAGLE NATION
ENERGY AND DERAILS
A BETTER QUESTION WOULD BE IS THE UNIVERSE JUST AN ACCIDENT OF THE MIND
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU CAN THINK WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MIND
MAKES YOU KINDA WONDER WHAT KIND OF UNIVERSES ARE IN THE VERY AIR YOU BREATHE AS YOU WALK ELECTRONS DISTURBED UNIVERSES DESTROYED TRILLIONTHS OF A FRACTION OF A SECOND AS I TYPE THIS CIVILIZATIONS CREATED AND DESTROYED BUT ON AN INFINITELY SMALLER SCALE
THIS ARTICLE SEEMS TO BE SCRATCHING AT AN IDEA THAT PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD BUT ONLY MUDDIES THE WATERS AS OPPOSED TO MAKING ANYTHING MORE CLEAR
I'M FAR MORE INCLINED TO THINK THE UNIVERSE IS THE RESULT OF OUR MINDS

WE CREATE OUR WORLD WITH OUR THOUGHT
I LIKE GOING THROUGH REDDIN TO SEE WHO HAS MORE WRINKLES IN THEIR BRAIN THAN ME
THE UNIVERSE IS MIND
OR IS THE UNIVERSE AN ACCIDENT OF THE MIND
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES PANPSYCHISM SEEM TO UNDERMINE THE ENTIRETY OF PHYSICS

EDIT WITH NONSENSE
THE MIND IS LIKE THE FIZZY CARBONATION IN AN ICE COLD BEVERAGE IT IS ALL ABOUT CHEMISTRY AND REACHES A TEMPORARY STATE OF SENTIENCE IT TASTES GREAT AND HAS A PLEASANT REFRESHING SMELL THAT TICKLES THE NOSE THEN IT GOES FLAT AND YOU CAN CORRODE A PENNY IN IT
GOBBLEDYGOOK IS A BETTER TITLE
DOESN'T ACCIDENT IMPLY THAT THERE WAS AN INTENTION
NO MYSTICISM REQUIRED THE LAWS OF PHYSICS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR STARS PLANETS AND EVENTUALLY EVOLUTION THIS PROCESS TAKES ANY INTELLIGENCE OUT OF IT YOU DON'T NEED INTELLIGENT ATOMS OR INTELLIGENT DESIGN TO GET CONSCIOUSNESS INTELLIGENT LIFE SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF PANPSYCHISM
THERE IS THIS IDEA IN POPULAR MEDIA THAT COMPARES THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN WITH MACROSCOPIC STRUCTURES OF THE UNIVERSE APPARENTLY THEY LOOK SIMILAR IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A NICE IDEA I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS CALLED PANPSYCHISM IT IS QUITE SIMILAR ALSO TO THE IDEA OF
NO IT IS INTELLIGENTLY AND LOVINGLY DESIGNED BY GOD
MAYBE THE UNIVERSE IS AN ACCIDENT OF THE MIND

WILL A TREE MOUNTAIN OR COW AGREE WITH OUR HUMAN DEFINITIONS

OUR MIND MAY BE TOO LIMITED BY THE RESTRAINTS OF OUR BODY
THINK THERMODYNAMICS IF HEAT ENERGY WHAT WOULD STOP A HIGHER POWER FROM USING CELESTIAL BODIES AS A SOURCE OF ENERGY JUST AS CELLS FORM TISSUE FORM ORGANS MAYBE WE ARE ALL PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER IN A WAY MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE EARTH HAS BEEN THROUGH MANY CYCLES OF TEMPERATURE VARIATION WE COULD BE A COMPONENT OF AN ENERGY GENERATOR OR CREATURES CREATIONS ARE USED FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE COLLECTING EXPERIENCES FROM AS MANY LIVING ORGANISMS AT A POINT IN TIME HUMANS CREATE MOST LIKELY THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES IN A LIFETIME COMPARED TO OTHER LIVING THINGS EVOLUTION SURE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT OUTWITTING OTHERS AND BECOMING MORE INTELLIGENT OR MAYBE WITH HUMANITY EXCEEDING ITS CARRYING CAPACITY WE ARE OVERDUE FOR A NUMBER DECREASE MAYBE A GREAT FLOOD PLAGUE OF LOCUSTS THE PLANET IS TRYING TO WOBBLE BACK INTO SOME BALANCE SPECIES NUMBERS GLOBAL TEMPERATURES THINK YUGA CYCLES OR KARDASHEV SCALE

SPIRIT IS JUST THE THOUGHTS OF THE ALL CURRENTLY RESIDING IN YOU YOU CAN'T CHANGE WHAT YOU DO ACCEPT YOUR PREDETERMINED FATE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE DRIVER OF EVOLUTION AND IS THE SPIRIT GOD IS FORM OF ENERGY WE CANNOT DISCOVER PRESENTLY OR EVER LANGUAGE DEVELOPED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME EVERYWHERE ON THE PLANET INVENTIONS AND STYLES OF MUSIC AND ART DID AS WELL

OUR BRAINS ARE RECEIVERS AND OTHER POINTS IN THE BODY RECEIVE MESSAGES CONSTANTLY ALSO BUT HUMANS HAVE NOT YET REACHED THE NEXT ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL TO KNOW WHY OR TO WHAT ENDS
AUSTRIAN PHYSICIST HEINZ OBERHUMMER WROTE A BOOK KANN DAS ALLES ZUFALL SEIN ABOUT IS EVERYTHING JUST AN ACCIDENT AND HE LITERALLY FOUND GOD IN NUCLEOSYNTHESIS OR RATHER A VERY SMALL MARGIN WHERE THE CREATION OF EVERYTHING WAS POSSIBLE

TO ME PERSONALLY PANPSYCHISM SEEMS LIKE A MODERN WAY TO BELIEVE IN SPIRITS AND I WONDER HOW THAT PERSPECTIVE WILL CHANGE OVER THE YEARS WILL I BE PRAGMATIC ENOUGH TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING ELSE SO I CAN DIE MORE EASILY
SPECIFICALLY A REDUCTIVE WORLD-VIEW LEAVES THE MIND LACKING ANY PURPOSE

FIRST WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE IS A PURPOSE SECOND MIND HAS A PURPOSE WITHIN EVOLUTION TO GIVE AN ADVANTAGE TO INDIVIDUALS THAT POSSES IT

ALSO HERE'S A LONG BUT INTERESTING ESSAY BY ELIEZER YUDKOWSKI SHOWING THE ABSURDITY OF VIEWS
THE MIND THE SELF CONSCIOUS AWARENESS OF EXPERIENCING REALITY THE I AM IS A GIFT THAT OUR UNIVERSE HAS BESTOWED UPON US SAME WITH OUR PHYSICAL BODY EVERYTHING WE HAVE MIND BODY SPIRIT CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN INDIVIDUALIZED UNIT OF A TYPE OF ENERGY THAT IS MUCH GREATER OLDER AND DIVINE THAN WHAT WE AS A SPECIES CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND LITERALLY PREEXISTENT ENERGY FIELDS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSCIOUSNESS PERVADING MATERIAL SPACE WE ARE PART OF THE UNIVERSE EXPERIENCING ITSELF OBJECTIVELY

WITH THE PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLE EX NIHIL NIHIL FIT NOTHING CAN BRING ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH IT DOES NOT ALREADY POSSESS YOU CAN EXPLAIN US HUMANS OR AS U THINK SUPER RARE INTELLIGENT LIFE PHENOMENON ARE REALLY JUST A NORMAL YET DIVINE OCCURRENCE AND THIS REALLY IS JUST HOW THE UNIVERSE HAS WORKED IS WORKING AND WILL FOREVER WORK CONSCIOUSNESS IS WHAT MAKES THE UNIVERSE EXIST WERE JUST A AMAL LINK IN AN INFINITE CHAIN THAT TELLS THE STORY OF EVOLVING CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGHOUT ALL OF CREATION
GOD CREATED THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WE ARE SLOWLY LEARNING HOW IT WORKS IF YOU WANT TO ARGUE WHO OR WHAT GOD IS YOU CAN BUT SOMETHING WAY OVER OUR PAY GRADE IS VERY INTENTIONAL IN THE WAY THIS WORLD WORKS AND HOW IT BEGAN AND HOW IT'S GOING TO END IT'S RIDICULOUS TO THINK ANY OF THIS IS ACCIDENTAL YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RELIGIOUS TO BELIEVE IN A CREATOR
I JUST NOTICED THAT THE LINKS TO THE VIDEOS SEEM TO BE MISSING THEY CAN STILL BE FOUND BY SEARCHING FOR THE TITLES BUT I'LL LINK THEM HERE FOR CONVENIENCE

LINK DESCRIPTION

THE CASE FOR NATURALISM THIS WAS MY OPENING STATEMENT AT A DEBATE ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IT WAS SET TO SOME VERY NICE VISUALS BY WHOEVER RUNS THE INSPIRATION JOURNEY YOUTUBE CHANNEL
POETIC NATURALISM A TALK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD THIS WAS AT A CONFERENCE OF SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS SO IT S A BIT MORE ACADEMIC THAN THE OTHERS
PURPOSE AND THE UNIVERSE A TALK TO THE AMERICAN HUMANIST CONFERENCE THE UNIVERSE DOESN T HAVE A PURPOSE NOR DOES IT GIVE ANY PURPOSES TO US THAT DOESN T PREVENT US FROM CREATING PURPOSE FOR OURSELVES
DEATH AND PHYSICS A TALK TO THE FREEDOM FROM RELIGION FOUNDATION LIFE IS A PROCESS NOT A SUBSTANCE AND DEATH IS THE END OF THAT PROCESS AS SURELY AS EXTINGUISHING A CANDLE IS THE END OF ITS FLAME CONFRONTING THIS REALITY IS A MAJOR PROJECT FOR NATURALISM

DEMOCRACY IS NOT ABOUT MAKING GOOD POLICY DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT MAKING GOVERNMENT LEGITIMATE
I THINK THIS SOUNDS GOOD IN THEORY

BRENNAN ARGUES THAT IT S ENTIRELY JUSTIFIABLE TO LIMIT THE POLITICAL POWER THAT THE IRRATIONAL THE IGNORANT AND THE INCOMPETENT HAVE OVER OTHERS

THE PROBLEM IS IN DETERMINING WHO IS IRRATIONAL IGNORANT OR INCOMPETENT IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME TEST AND THE TEST NEEDS TO BE DEVISED AND CONDUCTED BY SOMEONE THERE'S A TENDENCY OF PEOPLE TO RIG THE TESTS THEY CREATE EVEN IF UNINTENTIONALLY TOWARD PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH ME AND SHARE MY VIEWPOINT

THE ARTICLE EVEN BEGINS TO GET AT THIS LATER ON

THE IDEA OF A VOTER EXAM FOR EXAMPLE WAS DISMISSED BY BRENNAN HIMSELF IN THE ETHICS OF VOTING AS RIPE FOR ABUSE AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPTURE THERE S NO MENTION IN HIS NEW BOOK OF ANY MEASURES THAT HE WOULD PUT IN PLACE TO PREVENT SUCH DANGERS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT POLITICS BRENNAN REPORTS IS HIGHER IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORE EDUCATION AND HIGHER INCOME LIVE IN THE WEST BELONG TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND ARE MIDDLE-AGED IT S LOWER AMONG BLACKS AND WOMEN

AND I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS WHAT WE MEAN BY KNOWLEDGE OF POLITICS KNOWLEDGE OF WORLD EVENTS KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT EVENTS TRIVIA DOES THAT KNOWLEDGE COUNT IF IT'S SKEWED SLANTED OR INCOMPLETE INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE CAN BE MORE MISLEADING THAN COMPLETE IGNORANCE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THIS KNOWLEDGE ENTAILS AND EVEN WORSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT RELATES TO JUDGEMENT
ALL POLITICAL SYSTEMS HAVE THERE MERIT THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE NOT VOTERS BUT THOSE IN POWER PEOPLE ARE THE WORST PLAIN AND SIMPLE NO ONE IS IMMUNE FROM CORRUPTION BIAS SELF SERVITUDE THE GREATER GOOD OR THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF GROWTH THROUGH EXPANSION WHICH INEVITABLY LEADS TO CONFLICT AND OR EXPLOITATION
LETS BE HONEST IF WE COULD COUNT ON BENEVOLENT DICTATORS TO STAY BENEVOLENT THAT WOULD LIKELY BE THE BEST FORM OF GOVERNANCE

IT'S WORKED VERY WELL HISTORICALLY

UNTIL THEY BECOME NOT SO BENEVOLENT AND START THE MASS KILLINGS OF EVERYONE WHO HAS OPINION
I WAS WORRIED WHEN I STARTED SEEING PLATO MENTIONED AND THEN WAS GLAD TO SEE THIS

THE SCHEME WAS SO BYZANTINE AND COCKAMAMIE THAT MANY SUSPECT PLATO COULDN T HAVE BEEN SERIOUS HOBBES FOR ONE CALLED THE IDEA USELESS

IT'S DEPRESSING WHEN PEOPLE SERIOUSLY ADVOCATE FOR HAVING A PHILOSOPHER KING
ANY TEST TO CONFIRM THAT A CONSTITUENT HAS ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TO VOTE IS BIASED TOWARDS THE KNOWLEDGE VALUED BY THE TESTER THIS IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO A REGRESSIVE SYSTEM THAT BENEFITS AN EVER SMALLER CONSTITUENCY OF VALUED INDIVIDUALS

IT IS A VARIANT OF WHAT THE US HAS NOW IT MOVES THE CURRENT WEALTH BASED POLITICAL POWER INTO MORE DIRECT VOTING BASED POWER THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS VISIBLY FAILING JASON BRENNAN IS ARGUING THAT CEMENTING THE POWER OF THE ELITES WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT EVERY BIT OF EVIDENCE CONTRADICTS HIS THEORY

SOME PARTISAN EXAMPLES

THE EDUCATED ELITE CORRESPONDS STRONGLY TO WEALTHY WHITE MALES WEALTHY WHITE MALES FAVOR DONALD TRUMP OVER HILLARY CLINTON DONALD TRUMP IS A WALKING TALKING DISASTER WITH RESPECT TO EVERY FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT THE EDUCATED ELITE THAT BRENNAN ET AL WANT TO CONTROL ALL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT POLICIES THAT BENEFIT THEM PERSONALLY EVEN THOUGH THOSE POLICIES ARE TERRIBLE FOR THE COUNTRY TRICKLE DOWN OR EVEN THE WORLD CLIMATE CHANGE

I CLAIM THAT THERE IS NO BENEFIT TO THE TYPE OF SYSTEM BRENNAN PROPOSES AND ARGUABLY THERE IS A STRONG NEGATIVE AFFECTION
REMOVED
IT LOOKS LIKE VERY FEW PEOPLE HERE READ THE ARTICLE

ITS GOOD TO SEE A COLUMN CRITICALLY LOOKING AT EPISTOCRACY THE PROBLEM IS I THINK THAT EPISTOCRATS AREN'T MORE LIKELY TO BE ENLIGHTENED THAN DEMOCRATS IN AMERICA THEY WOULD LARGELY VOTE FOR TRUMP APPARENTLY WHICH SHOULD BE DISQUALIFICATION ENOUGH MAYBE POOR BLACKS AND LEGIT PEOPLE SHOULD VOTE THE PEOPLE WHO DECIDE ON SOCIAL POLICY EXPERTISE IN BEING A COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE MALE DOESN'T ACTUALLY COVER ALL PARTS OF HUMAN EXISTENCE AND GIVEN OLDER WHITER RICHER PEOPLE VOTE MORE SURELY BRENNAN MUST CONCEDE HE'S ALREADY IN AN IMPERFECT EPISTOCRACY AND THAT KINDA SUCKS GIVEN HE'S USING EPISTOCRATIC ARGUMENTS TO SHOW IT IS TERRIBLE

THE TRUTH IS I SUSPECT THAT DEMOCRACY WORKS BECAUSE IT ALLOCATES SOME POWER TO EVERYONE IN A WAY EVERYONE ROUGHLY RESPECTS AND ITS NO SURPRISE THAT IN DEMOCRACIES THOSE WHO CAN'T OR DON'T VOTE IN GREAT NUMBERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE MARGINALIZED

AND THE MORE POLITICAL THE MORE FACTIONS FICTIONEERING I THINK THE STRONGER DEMOCRACIES ARE WHEN THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF COOPERATION AND COMPETITION POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE POLITICAL ENDS I THINK THIS IS AN AMERICAN PROBLEM BECAUSE THEIR POLITICS ARE AWFUL AND THE SOLUTION IS SIGNIFICANT CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE AROUND HOW THEY CHOOSE REPRESENTATIVES
AN ARISTOCRACY OR OLIGARCHY OR WHATEVER ASSUMES THAT THERE'S AN OBJECTIVELY TRUE VERSION OF GOOD SO THAT THERE'S A GOOD GOVERNMENT AND A BAD GOVERNMENT AND WE CAN DECIDE WHICH IS WHICH ABSOLUTELY DEMOCRATIC FORMS OF GOVERNMENT ASSUME THAT EITHER THIS DOESN'T EXIST OR CAN'T BE DETERMINED OBJECTIVELY SO WE HAVE EVERYONE THROW IN THEIR OPINION ON THE MATTER



PUT ANOTHER WAY IF A MAJORITY OF VOTERS REALLY WANTED EVERYONE TO WEAR A PURPLE HAT WHO IS TO SAY THAT PURPLE HATS WEREN'T THE GREATEST GOOD
WHY DO INTELLECTUALS ALWAYS THINK THINGS WOULD BE BETTER IF ONLY THEY WERE IN CHARGE

WHY DO IGNORAMUS ALWAYS THINK THINGS WOULD BE BETTER IF ONLY THEY WERE IN CHARGE
INTERESTING ARTICLE I APPRECIATE HOW IT ATTEMPTS NOT TO TAKE A SIDE IN THE DISCUSSION BUT PRESENTS THE DIFFICULTIES WITHIN DEMOCRACIES AS WELL AS THEIR PROPOSED REPLACEMENTS

I THINK THE QUESTION OF A QUALIFIED VOTER IS INTERESTING BUT THE BOTTOM LINE TO ME IS THAT WE MUST AT SOME POINT TRUST IN OUR BASIC ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS COLLABORATE AND HAVE THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS IN MIND THAT'S OF COURSE NOT TRUE FOR EVERYONE BUT ONCE WE BECOME SO DISTRUSTFUL OF CANDIDATES AS WELL AS VOTERS WE'VE GIVEN UP ON THE VERY CONCEPT OF A NATION

REGARDLESS OF THE SYSTEM USED TO DETERMINE REPRESENTATION AND GOVERNANCE WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE FREEDOM AND INTEGRITY OF INFORMATION OVER ALL

WE CANNOT FORCE VOTERS AND REPRESENTATIVES TO BE VULCANS BUT WE CAN LEAD THEM TO THE INFORMATION THEY WOULD NEED TO ACT LIKE ONE
DELETED
I THINK THERE'S AN IMPORTANT QUOTE WHICH MAY BE FOUND IN THIS ARTICLE

DEMOCRACY IS THE WORST FORM OF GOVERNMENT EXCEPT ALL THOSE OTHER FORMS THAT HAVE BEEN TRIED FROM TIME TO TIME

WINSTON CHURCHILL
REMOVED
ALL THIS SEEMS TO MISS THE FACT THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC THAT IS THE ISSUE THAT MOST AMERICAN SEEM TO LAMENT ABOUT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THE PEOPLE ELECTED DON'T REALLY REFLECT THEIR CONSTITUENCY THEY ARE ELITES REPRESENTING PLEBES AND THEREFORE VOTE TO ENRICH THE ELITE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PLEBES

I PERSONALLY THINK WE SHOULD JUST MOVE TO A DIRECT DEMOCRACY OR LAWMAKER JURY TYPE ARRANGEMENT TO BEST REPRESENT THE PEOPLE BALLOT INITIATIVES SEEM TO BE THE ONLY WAY TO GET ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY THESE STATES AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY DIRECT DEMOCRACY ALTERNATIVELY IF WE JUST RANDOMLY PUT PEOPLE INTO THE GOVERNMENT I HARDLY DOUBT THEY WOULD MESS IT UP ANYMORE THAN IT CURRENTLY IS I THINK IT WOULD SIMPLIFY LAWS SO EVERYDAY PEOPLE COULD EASILY UNDERSTAND FOLLOW THEM

OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE MANY DETAILS TO IRON OUT AND WE'D HAVE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO PREVENT TYRANNY OF THE MASSES AND HUGE POLICY SWINGS WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE APPROACHES INSTEAD
THE CASE FOR DEMOCRACY EACH ADULT CITIZEN HAS A RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT EXCERSIZES AUTHORITY OVER THEM FOR FUCK SAKE WE WENT TO WAR WITH GREAT BRITAIN OVER THIS IDEA
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT WAS INEVITABLY GOING TO BE THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FUTURE IF WE LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE A FUTURE DYSTOPIAN WORLD FOLLOWING BEING THE ALTERNATIVE ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT PLATON SEEM TO WISH FOR
LIFE WORK SUMMED UP HETP
HITLER I LOVE YOUR BOOK MAN SUPERMAN NOT EVERYONE IS EQUAL KILL ALL THE JEWS

NIETZSCHE SORRY



T
JUST AN ASIDE BUT I HATE WHEN A PAGE TRIES TO MAKE YOU WATCH A VIDEO INSTEAD OF LETTING YOU JUST READ THE ARTICLE
I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE CONTENT ON THIS SUB FOR THE BEGINNERS THANKS OP

QUESTION TO YOU AND OTHERS WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP AFTER WATCHING LOADS OF VIDEOS ON PHILOSOPHY I FEEL IT'S TOO SOON TO START READING ACTUAL ORIGINAL BOOKS WORKS YET

WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR HELP
WHEN I READ THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA

I DECIDED THAT FAVORITE MOVIE WOULD BE FERRIS DAY OFFICIAL
REMOVED
A REALLY GREAT PODCAST PHILOSOPHIZE THIS IS CURRENTLY DOING A SERIES ON NIETZSCHE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT
THE GENEALOGY WAS THE MOST INSIGHTFUL THING I'VE EVER READ THAT KIND OF RESENTFUL REVERSAL OF VALUES OR ATTITUDES ETC IS SOMETHING I'VE SEEN IN SO MANY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND NOT JUST IN RELIGION


AND THE FEW TIMES I'M OBLIGATED TO GO TO CHURCH FOR FAMILY REASONS WHEN I VISIT MY PARENTS I'M OFTEN REMINDED OF READING THAT BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I'M SITTING IN A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR SANCTUARY WITH A SOUNDBOARD THAT COST HEARING ABOUT HOW THE WORLD HATES US AND WE NEED TO NOT MOVE BEYOND IT BECAUSE THE WORLD IS FAILING


WHAT I WONDER IS HAS ANY WORK OF FICTION FOULED UP NIETZSCHE MORE THAN GOD'S NOT DEAD
I DON'T SEE HOW POP CULTURE CAN GET SOMETHING WRONG AS IF IT IS SOME DELIBERATING ENTITY ALL OF THE MOVIE CLIPS IN THE VIDEO FEATURE CHARACTERS TALKING ABOUT NIETZSCHE AND ENGLISH LIT TELLS US THAT WHAT A CHARACTER SAYS IS NOT INDICATIVE OF THE AUTHOR'S OR BELIEFS I HAVE ONLY SEEN A HANDFUL OF THE MOVIES FEATURED IN THE VIDEO BUT IN SOME OF THEM THE THOUGHTS ABOUT NIETZSCHE WERE PRESENTED AS THOSE OF CHARACTERS WHO WERE THEMSELVES ARROGANT DUMB OR THUS POP CULTURE MAY BE COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDING NIETZSCHE YOU CAN DEFINITELY SAY CERTAIN PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND NIETZSCHE OR EVEN MOST PEOPLE BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT HOLDS FOR POP CULTURE

ALSO I DON'T THINK IT'S WHOLLY ACCURATE TO PORTRAY NIETZSCHE AS THIS BRIGHT RAY OF SUNSHINE AS MANY PEOPLE NOWADAYS DO WHO SAYS BE OURSELF AND BE CREATIVE AND NIHILISM IS BAD LAO NIETZSCHE HAD A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP TO NIHILISM IN ITS MULTIPLE SENSE AND WAS NOT AFRAID OF DISCUSSING THE MEANINGLESSNESS OF EXISTENCE THE TRIUMPH OF SLAVE MORALITY OVER CREATIVE INDIVIDUALS OR INDIVIDUAL SUFFERING TOWARDS NO END THE VIDEO KIND OF IMPLIES THAT THE VALUES WE ARE TO CREATE ARE GOING TO BE POSITIVE FOR OTHERS AND NOT SELFISH IN ANY WAY IE THE OVERMAN IS IN DISTINCTION TO MASTER MORALITY ALONE BUT CREATING VALUES THAT SIMPLY REPRODUCE DEMOCRACY AND EQUALITY ARE NO CREATION AND NIETZSCHE WROTE ON THE CRUELTY POWER AND DISTANCE OF THE OVERMAN
OF COURSE THAT APPROACH TO HIM IS IN REACTION TO TEENAGERS AND NAZIS MISREADING HIM WHO ARE SHOCKINGLY STILL AROUND AND GROWING BUT I THINK THIS SAFE READING OF HIM HAS ITS OWN HIDDEN AGENDAS THAT REPRODUCE EXACTLY WHAT NIETZSCHE HATED
REMOVED
COULDN'T SEE THE VIDEO BUT I'LL MAKE A FEW POINTS
YES NIETZSCHE NIHILISM IS OPTIMISTIC WITHOUT QUESTION NIETZSCHE IS REACTING TO PESSIMISM TO SCHOPENHAUER WHILE HE CERTAINLY ACCEPTS MUCH OF SCHOPENHAUER PHILOSOPHY AND HOLDS HIM TO HIGH REGARD HIS PESSIMISM IS DESPISED
ANOTHER MYTH IS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOME PEOPLE TEND TO ASSOCIATE NIETZSCHE WITH STINER ESQUE INDIVIDUALISM THIS IS NOT THE CASE IT ISN'T THAT NIETZSCHE WANTS TO DESTROY MYTHS HE RATHER WANTS TO CREATE LIFE AFFIRMING MYTHS A TRAGIC CULTURE HE AFFIRMS GODS HERE GREEK GODS SINCE THEY BROUGHT A FULLY LIFE AFFIRMING CULTURE THIS IS HIS CENTRAL THESIS OF THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY CHRISTIANITY IS NOT REJECTED FOR BEING A SPOOK OR SOMETHING IT IS REJECTED FOR UPHOLDING A MYTH THAT HINDERS THE AFFIRMATION OF LIFE PRAGMATISM ALTHOUGH THIS CRITIQUE MAY WORK FOR TRADITIONAL CHRISTIANITY AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT NIETZSCHE IS GETTING AT AN HISTORICAL ANALYSIS THIS CRITIQUE FAILS IN MODERN CHRISTIANITY SUCH THAT WE SEE IN DOSTOEVSKY AND THIS BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER MYTH NIETZSCHE HATES RELIGION THIS IS FAR FROM THE TRUTH NIETZSCHE HAS HIGH REGARD FOR PAGAN RELIGIONS AGAIN RELIGION IN ITSELF IS NOT WHAT NIETZSCHE IS INTERESTED IN ONLY THE CULTURAL RELATION
EH I'M PRETTY SURE TD MENTIONS NIETZSCHE ONLY ONCE I REMEMBER CHARACTER TALKING A LOT MORE SCHOPENHAUER
THAT WAS A SHORT ARTICLE THE REASON POP CULTURE GOT NIETZSCHE WRONG IS THAT WE DIDN'T CONSIDER HIM OUR GREATEST PHILOLOGIST TURNED SOCIAL CRITIC AND LUMPED HIM IN WITH PHILOSOPHERS READ GORGIAS YOU'LL FIND NIETZSCHE
DOESN'T POP CULTURE GET EVERYTHING WRONG
THIS IS GREAT EXCEPT FOR THE TRUE DETECTIVE EXAMPLE IN THAT SCENE THE GUY SAYS TIME IS A FLAT CIRCLE AND RUST NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE MEANS ASKS WHAT IS THAT NIETZSCHE

LATER IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH THE TWO COPS RUST REVISITS THE TOPIC AND IT'S CLEAR THAT HE NOW REALIZES IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH NIETZSCHE

IN FACT PALAZZO TRUE CREATOR HAS HINTED THAT THE WHOLE BIT ABOUT TIME BEING A FLAT CIRCLE COMES FROM THE CHARACTERS HAVING SOME INKLING OF AWARENESS THAT THEY ARE TV CHARACTERS 2 DIMENSIONAL FLAT AND DOOMED TO REPEAT THE SAME STORY FOREVER IN A CIRCLE WE THE VIEWERS ARE THE BEINGS THAT RUST MENTIONS

SO YEAH IT'S NOT NIETZSCHE BUT THE SHOW NEVER CLAIMED IT WAS
SEASON ONE OF TRUE DETECTIVE WAS STILL BOMB AS FUCK THOUGH
AS A COMPLETE LAYMAN I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT WOULD MAKE HUMANITY NOT SELFISH IF NOT FOR OBJECTIVE MORALITY THERE ARE OR NOT FEW SUPERIOR PEOPLE WHO CAN DO THAT BUT OTHER BILLIONS ARE NOT SO WHAT ABOUT VERY PRAGMATIC STUFF LIKE SOCIETY AND CIVIL ORDER
HAS ANYONE READ HIS LECTURES TITLED I'VE FOUND THEM TO BE QUITE INTERESTING AND REALLY APPLICABLE TODAY THEY'RE CERTAINLY SOME OF HIS LESSER KNOWN WORKS
SO THE TIME IS CIRCLE THING IS BASICALLY THE DEMON AT THE END OF THE BED SCENARIO
I NEVER RESEARCHED HIM MUCH BUT WHEN I HEARD ABOUT NIHILISM I ALWAYS VIEWED IT THROUGH AN OPTIMISTIC LENSE I MEAN YEAH EVERYTHING IS CHAOTIC AND IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS VERY LITTLE IF ANYTHING AT ALL MATTERS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T ENJOY WHAT WE HAVE FOR IT'S OWN SAKE AND STRIVE TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP CHRISTIANITY AND OTHER SUCH RELIGIONS PROVIDE AN ETERNAL REWARD FOR DOING GOOD AND KEEPING SOCIETY IN ORDER WHILE SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T EXPECT A REWARD FOR THAT IF THAT'S SO WHY DO WE NEED IT AT ALL TO DO WHAT IS BENEFICIAL FOR OURSELVES AND EACH OTHER DISCARDING BELIEF IN ALL OF THIS PREESTABLISHED ORDER AND MORAL CODE AND THEN CONTINUING TO DO WHAT WE FEEL IS RIGHT IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE ALTERNATIVE PERHAPS EVEN BETTER SINCE IT'S MORE FLEXIBLE AND CAN LET US PROGRESS AND IMPROVE AS A SOCIETY MORE EASILY THAT'S WHAT I GATHERED FROM NIHILISM
I TAUGHT A UNIT ON MODERNIST PHILOSOPHY IN MY ENGLISH CLASSES LAST YEAR IT TOOK ME THREE WEEKS TO CONVINCE MY STUDENTS THAT GOD IS DEAD WAS ABOUT CULTURE AND OUR SOCIETY NO LONGER ALIGNING WITH CENTURY CHRISTIANITY AND THAT GIVEN HOW DIFFERENTLY WE ACT THAN THEY DID THAT HE WAS RIGHT IT WAS A PROCESS
I NEVER DID MUCH READING ABOUT NIETZSCHE BUT I ALWAYS TOOK A BIG INTEREST IN NIHILISM

I'M NOT SURE IF THE PHILOSOPHY I LIVE BY IS TRUE NIHILISM BUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT WAS NO OBJECTIVE OR UNIVERSAL VALUE TO ANYTHING INCLUDING HUMAN LIFE IS POSITIVE BECAUSE IT MEANS COMPLETE FREEDOM FROM WORRY BASICALLY THE WAY I VIEW NIHILISM IS THAT I AGREE WITH THE PREMISE THAT NOTHING OR NOONE HAS ANY REAL OBJECTIVE VALUE BUT IT DOES NOT PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO FIND SUBJECTIVE MEANING IN LIFE AND THUS ENJOY IT IN ALL ASPECTS

FOR ME BOTH MORAL AND EXISTENTIAL NIHILISM LEAD TO ATARAXIA AND NOTHING NEGATIVE

DISCLAIMER ENGLISH IS NOT MY NATIVE LANGUAGE INCASE MY GRAMMAR IS MESSED UP
IS IT SUPRISING WHEN HE IS CRITICISING TWO STAPLES OF WESTERN LIFE DRINKING AND CHRISTIANITY AND CALLING PEOPLE WHO DO THESE THINGS INFERIOR AND SHEEP

HE WAS NOT A TACTFUL MANUAL
I ALWAYS EXPLAIN BIG N THUSLY HE HAD A VISION OF THE MODERN WORLD AND IT DROVE HIM MAD TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY OF SAVING US FROM IT
I DO INHERENTLY BELIEVE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS MEANINGLESS BUT ACCEPTING THAT LACK OF MEANING AFTER BECOMING AWARE OF IT IS SUCH A WASTE OF THAT KNOWLEDGE WE ARE AS FAR AS WE KNOW THE ONLY BEINGS IN THIS MEANINGLESS UNIVERSE TO BECOME CONSCIOUS AND RECOGNIZE WHERE WE EXIST AND WE MUST CREATE MEANING IN LIFE NOT JUST ACCEPT MEANINGLESSNESS
I'D LIKE TO SEE SLAVDOM ŽIŽEK DISCUSS THIS WITH LADY GAGA
ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT THE MOVIE SCENE AT IS FROM THE LIFE OF BRIAN

EDIT OOPS POSTED THIS BEFORE FINDING THAT PLENTY OF THE OTHER VIDEOS ARE ALSO FROM MONTY PYTHON
THE WORD OBJECTIVE SEEMS TO BE THROWING ME OFFICIAL WOULDN'T OBJECTIVE MORALITY NOT RELY ON RELIGION OR CLASS IDENTITY WOULDN'T THE KIND OF MORALITY NIETZSCHE PROMOTED BE OBJECTIVE
HE BELIEVED WE COULD MORALLY REJECT MORALS
ALEX NOT SIREN ORGY OF THE WILL IS PROBABLY AN EXAMPLE OF THIS KIND OF MISINTERPRETATION OF NIETZSCHE HARD TO STOMACH HARD TO BELIEVE HE MAKES A COUPLE OF GOOD POINTS
SOME DAY AFTER A MUCH LONGER PREPARATION WILL AN EVEN MORE FEARFUL BLAZE FROM THE OLD FIRE NOT HAVE TO TAKE PLACE MORE THAN THAT WOULDN T THIS BE EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD HOPE FOR WITH ALL
OUR STRENGTH EVEN WILL IT EVEN DEMAND IT ANYONE WHO LIKE MY READERS BEGINS TO REFLECT ON THESE POINTS TO THINK FURTHER WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY COMING TO A QUICK CONCLUSION REASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO COME TO A CONCLUSION MYSELF PROVIDED THAT IT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR FOR A LONG TIME WHAT I WANT PRECISELY WHAT I WANT WITH THAT
DANGEROUS SLOGAN WHICH IS WRITTEN ON THE BODY OF MY LAST BOOK BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL
AT LEAST THIS DOES NOT MEAN BEYOND GOOD AND BAD
GENEALOGY OF MORALS ESSAY SECTION

IT SEEMS HERE THAT NIETZSCHE ACTIVELY SUPPORTS A RETURN TO MASTER MORALITY SOMETHING THAT YOU SAY IN THE VIDEO HE DOES NOT THOUGHTS I AM NOT SURE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN HE ARGUES WE SHOULD WILL THE OLD FIRE PAST MORALITY TO RETURN HE IS SUPPORTING THE NOTION OF THE RETURN OF MASTER MORALITY

JUST READ THE BOOKS
IT'S FINE TO GET PEOPLE INTO THE BOOKS AND THINK MORE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS STUFF BUT PEOPLE DON'T JUST PULL THINGS OUT OF THIN AIR IF THIS IS HOW THEY READ NIETZSCHE THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN NIETZSCHE THAT LENDS HIM TO BE READ THIS WAY
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ THE WILL TO POWER AND IT BECOMES BLOODY OBVIOUS WHAT HIS STANCE ON NIHILISM AND WHAT HIS OWN PHILOSOPHY WAS
WOULD LEOPOLD AND VIEW OF WRITING BE CLASSED UNDER THE POP CULTURE DISTORTION
I'VE READ A BIT OF NIETZSCHE ONLY ALSO SIRACH ZARATHUSTRA THUS FAR DIDN'T RLY MAKE ME WANNA READ MORE

HE HAS SOME INTERESTING THOUGHTS OR BETTER SAID READING HIM TRIGGERS SOME INTERESTING THOUGHT PROCESSES BUT I BARELY FIND MYSELF AGREEING WITH HIS POSITION

HYPOTHESIS HOW POP CULTURE GOT INSERT ANYTHING HERE WRONG IS ALWAYS A VALID STATEMENT
THERE WAS A CLUSTER OF NIETZSCHE FANBOYS WHO CIRCULATED AROUND STICKUM IN ITS HEYDAY THEY ACTED AS IF BODY OF WORK WAS GOSPEL

NEARLY EVERYONE GETS NIETZSCHE WRONG AND NOT JUST THE FANBOYS NIETZSCHE AND SCHOPENHAUER WERE VITALISTS ENTIRE LIFE WORK WAS BUILDING UP A SYSTEM AROUND AN AMORPHOUS COSMIC SUBSTANCE CALLED THE WILL TO POWER THIS ELAN VITAL IS ALLEGEDLY EXPRESSED IN MORE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS IN LONE APEX PREDATORS AND EXPRESSED LESS IN HIVE INSECTS AND HERD ANIMALS HE EXPLICITLY WROTE THAT IT IS EXPRESSED PARTIALLY IN AMOEBAS

NIETZSCHE THEN WENT ON TO CHARACTERIZE CHRISTIAN MORALITY AS A QUOTE SICKNESS OF THE WILL USING HERE VITALIST TERMS AGAIN

THE FACT THAT NIETZSCHE WAS SCIENTIFICALLY WRONG ABOUT BIOLOGY AND LIFE ON EARTH WAS SOMETHING THE FANBOYS COULD NEITHER UNDERSTAND NOR STOMACH THEIR DENIAL EXTENDED EVEN WHEN SUCH WAS EXPLAINED TO THEM IN CLEAR LANGUAGE BACKED BY MULTIPLE QUOTATIONS OF WRITINGS

THE MISUNDERSTANDING IS IN THE SUPPOSITION THAT ANYONE WHO BELIEVES IN VITALISM MUST BE STUPID OR UNEDUCATED IN SOME WAY AGAIN THIS IS MORE MISUNDERSTANDING OF HISTORY VITALISM WAS BELIEVED BY THE MOST HIGHLY EDUCATED SCIENTISTS OF THE VICTORIAN ERA VITALISM INHERITED FROM HIS UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR ARTUR SCHOPENHAUER DID NOT MAKE HIM STUPID IT MADE HIM A MAN OF HIS TIME




FOR YOU DOWNVOTERS

THE FOLLOWING TEXT IS BUT ONE EXAMPLE IN SUPPORT OF THE ABOVE NIETZSCHE GOES ON IN OTHER BOOKS AND EXTENDS THIS NOTION TO OTHER ANIMALS AND INSECTS IN ONE CASE TALKING EXTENSIVELY ABOUT BEES

THE AMOEBA IS A METAPHOR THAT NIETZSCHE USES IN MULTIPLE PLACES AS FONZ POINTS OUT THERE IS A REFERENCE TO A PROTOPLASM OR AMOEBA AS YOU TRANSLATE HERE IN WP I SUGGEST EITHER THE KAUFMANN OR LEVY TRANSLATIONS AS THESE ARE PROBABLY MOST AUTHENTIC TO THE ORIGINAL GERMAN FROM MY COPY OF LEVY AT NOTE


THE WILL TO POWER CAN MANIFEST ITSELF ONLY AGAINST OBSTACLES IT THEREFORE GOES IN SEARCH OF WHAT RESISTS IS THE PRIMITIVE TENDENCY OF THE PROTOPLASM WHEN IT EXTENDS ITS PSEUDOPODIA AND FEELS ABOUT IT THE ACT OF APPROPRIATION AND ASSIMILATION IS ABOVE ALL THE RESULT OF A DESIRE TO OVERPOWER A PROCESS OF FORMING OF ADDITIONAL BUILDING AND REBUILDING UNTIL AT LAST THE SUBJECTED CREATURE HAS BECOME COMPLETELY A PART OF THE SUPERIOR CREATURE'S SPHERE OF POWER AND HAS INCREASED THE LATTER

HERE ALSO FROM KAUFMANN

LET US TAKE THE SIMPLEST CASE THAT OF PRIMITIVE NOURISHMENT THE PROTOPLASM STRETCHES ITS PSEUDOPODIA IN ORDER TO SEARCH FOR SOMETHING THAT RESISTS FROM HUNGER BUT FROM WILL TO POWER IT THEN ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME THIS THING TO APPROPRIATE IT TO INCORPORATE IT WHAT WE CALL NOURISHMENT IS MERELY A DERIVATIVE APPEARANCE A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THAT ORIGINAL WILL TO BECOME STRONGER

TURNED INTO A DARLING OF NAZI NIETZSCHE WAS NOT A NAZI HIS MATERIAL WAS LATER EDITED BY HIS SISTER WHO WAS A NAZI SUPPORTER AND ABSOLUTELY DEFILED HIS WORK WITH HER NAZI PROPAGANDA
REMOVED
TIL POP CULTURE ICON JANYE WEST IS VERY LIKELY A NIETZSCHEAN SUPERMAN



HMM I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THEY DIDN'T MENTION ALSO SIRACH ZARATHUSTRA AS A TYPE OF HONORABLE MENTION AT THE END
REMOVED
ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR SOMEONE WHO EXAMINES SOMETHING SO DEEP THAT EVENTUALLY IT KILLS THEM
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT HE ULTIMATELY DID FAIL TO ADVANCE THE HUMAN CONDITION
MY SYSTEM DOESN'T LIKE FLASH VIDEOS AND NEITHER DO I REALLY
SO HERE'S MY GENERIC RESPONSE TO STUFF LIKE THIS

SURE THE POP CULTURE UNDERSTANDING OF NIETZSCHE IS SHALLOW AND
ALL THAT AND OKAY YOU CAN CALL HIM A SUBTLE THINKER BUT YOU
CAN ALSO SAY THAT HE WAS ALL OVER THE MAP AND DIDN'T
FUNDAMENTALLY MAKE ANY SENSE THE ETERNAL RETURN THE COMING
OF THE OVERMAN DO THOSE TWO REALLY WORK TOGETHER IF THEY DID
IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU WOULD CARE

HE WAS A PHILOSOPHER WHO WENT AROUND TALKING ABOUT HOW HE'D
LIKE TO MAKE MANKIND STRONGER MORE EVIL MORE PROFOUND AND MORE
BEAUTIFUL SO IT SHOULD HARDLY COME AS A SURPRISE THAT SOME
GENUINELY EVIL PEOPLE LATCHED ON TO HIM AS THEIR GUY

SURE HE CERTAINLY WAS OPPOSED TO ANTI-SEMITISM BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT OPPOSITION WAS A BIG THEME IN HIS MAJOR WORKS IT COMES
UP IN NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER AS I REMEMBER IT AND NO PLACE
MORE PROMINENT THAN THAT

HE WROTE ABOUT HOW RELIGION IS STUPID AND HAD THIS NEW SUPERIOR WAY OF THINKING AND LIVING BUT WHAT DID IT DO FOR HIM HE HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN AND DIED A SAD MANUAL

WHEN I READ THUS SPOKE THARATHUSTRA I BEALL BELIEVED HE ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A CHRISTIAN HAD HE UNDERSTOOD CHRISTIANITY JESUS TALKED ABOUT BEING UBERMENSCH YEARS EARLIER HE CALLED IT BEING SON OF MAN
REMOVED
COUNT ME AMONG THE APPARENTLY NAIVE ATHEISTS WHO BELIEVE THE EXISTENCE OF GOD CAN BE TREATED AS A SCIENTIFIC QUESTION

BY VAN OWN ADMISSION GOD'S EXISTENCE IS NOT TESTABLE THROUGH EMPIRICAL METHODS HE HAS NO LOCAL PRESENCE SO IT FOLLOWS THAT THE A UNIVERSE AND A GODLESS UNIVERSE ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF OBSERVATION SO PARSIMONY RECOMMENDS THAT WE ACCEPT THE THE MODEL WITH FEWER ONTOLOGICAL COMMITMENTS THAT THERE IS NO GOD SINCE SCIENTISTS ROUTINELY ADJUDICATE BETWEEN COMPETING THEORIES USING SUCH OCKHAMIST CONSIDERATIONS I TAKE THIS ARGUMENT TO EXIST WELL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF SCIENCE

REALLY I THINK THAT VAN INWAGEN ANTICIPATES THIS POINT AND TRIES TO HEAD IT OFF WITH SOME OBSCURE SPOOKY HANDWAVING

YOU SEE GOD IS NOT THAT GHOSTLY DAD WHO ANSWERS OUR PRAYERS AND PERFORMS MIRACLES DESPITE WHAT THOSE VULGAR LAYPEOPLE BELIEVE SO STUPID ATHEIST YOU CAN'T JUST PERFORM SOME EXPERIMENT AND PROVE THAT HE IS NOT THERE BUT THEN AGAIN HE'S NOT QUITE THE INVISIBLE DRAGON THAT WE CAN BANISH THROUGH APPEAL TO PARSIMONY EITHER YOU SEE GOD IS CONNECTED WITH OUR OBSERVATIONS OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD IN ONLY THE MOST INDIRECT AND SUBTLE OF WAYS
I THINK THE TITLE REALLY DOESN'T DO THIS ARTICLE JUSTICE SURE AT FIRST THE AUTHOR BRUSHES ON THE STATED QUESTION BUT THE ARTICLE RAPIDLY EVOLVES INTO A MUCH BROADER ARGUMENT ABOUT THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY ITSELF I WOULD SUGGEST EVERYONE TO READ THE ENTIRE ARTICLE AT LEAST UP TO THE PAGE LABELED
PROOF IS FOR ALCOHOL AND MATHEMATICS SCIENCE NEVER PROVES ANYTHING



WE CAN HOWEVER ASK IF GOD IS A GOOD THEORY

I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS ARGUMENT IS THE LACK OF DEFINITION FOR ATHEISM I TEND TO GO WITH THE GENERAL THOUGH LESSER KNOWN DEFINITION OF ATHEISM WHICH IS A LACK OF BELIEF IN GOD I PERSONALLY DO NOT THINK IT IS POSSIBLE TO DISPROVE A GOD AND THINKING THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GOD IS AT THE SAME LEVEL OF IRRATIONALITY AS BEING SURE THAT THERE IS A GOD
CAN SCIENCE DISPROVE ANY CONCEPT THAT IS RELATIVE VAGUE OR UNSPECIFIED WHAT IS GOD ASK PEOPLE THAT QUESTION AND I DOUBT YOU WILL GET A COMMON ANSWER CERTAIN CONCEPTS CAN BE DISCREDITED USING SCIENCE AS LONG AS THEY ARE SPECIFIED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT MAYBE IT'S JUST ME THAT WONDERS WHICH SPECIFIC DEFINITION OF THE TERM GOD PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY WRITE PAPERS SUCH AS THIS
GODS WERE IN THE PAST AND ARE CURRENTLY WAYS TO EXPLAIN THAT WHICH WE CANNOT YET EXPLAIN

BACK A FEW MILLENIA AGO THEY WERE USED TO EXPLAIN WEATHER CROP YIELDS PRAYED TO FOR WAR ETC

I SUSPECT THAT WHILE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DISPROVE GOD'S EXISTENCE NOT FOR A LOONG TIME WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN MORE AND MORE THINGS THROUGH SCIENCE AS WE DO THAT GOD WILL HAVE FEWER AND FEWER PURPOSES
SOMEONE MUST HAVE COLLECTED WORKS IN COMPUTER FORMAT ABLE TO BE SEARCHED BY KEY WORD

I HAVE GIVEN SOME BASIC IDEA OF WHERE TO FIND SOME OF THESE THINGS

SEARCH TREE IN HUMAN ALL TOO HUMAN

SEARCH FOR HIVE OR BEE ALSO BEEHIVE

WASP

SEARCH FOR HERD HERD INSTINCT AND INSTINCT

SEARCH AMOEBA AND PROTOPLASM POSSIBLE PSEUDOPOD

INSECT

BEAST PREDATOR AND PREY

WILL

POWER MIGHT AS WELL FIND ALL REFERENCES


NIETZSCHE MAKES AN EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO

BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL

CHAPTER II THE FREE SPIRIT

WHAT THEY WOULD FAIN ATTAIN
WITH ALL THEIR STRENGTH IS THE UNIVERSAL HAPPINESS OF THE
HERD TOGETHER WITH SECURITY SAFETY COMFORT AND ALLEVIATION OF LIFE
FOR EVERY ONE THEIR TWO MOST FREQUENTLY CHANTED SONGS AND DOCTRINES
ARE CALLED EQUALITY OF RIGHTS AND SYMPATHY WITH ALL SUFFERERS AND
SUFFERING ITSELF IS LOOKED UPON BY THEM AS SOMETHING WHICH MUST BE
DONE AWAY WITH WE OPPOSITE ONES HOWEVER WHO HAVE OPENED OUR EYE AND
CONSCIENCE TO THE QUESTION HOW AND WHERE THE PLANT MAN HAS HITHERTO
GROWN MOST VIGOROUSLY BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS ALWAYS TAKEN PLACE UNDER
THE OPPOSITE CONDITIONS THAT FOR THIS END THE DANGEROUSNESS OF HIS
SITUATION HAD TO BE INCREASED ENORMOUSLY HIS INVENTIVE FACULTY AND
DISSEMBLING POWER HIS SPIRIT HAD TO DEVELOP INTO SUBTLETY AND DARING
UNDER LONG OPPRESSION AND COMPULSION AND HIS WILL TO LIFE HAD TO BE
INCREASED TO THE UNCONDITIONED WILL TO POWER WE BELIEVE THAT SEVERITY
VIOLENCE SLAVERY DANGER IN THE STREET AND IN THE HEART SECRECY
STOICISM ART AND DEVILRY OF EVERY KIND THAT EVERYTHING
WICKED TERRIBLE TYRANNICAL PREDATORY AND SERPENTINE IN MAN SERVES
AS WELL FOR THE ELEVATION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES AS ITS OPPOSITE
FROM HUMAN ALL TOO HUMAN APHORISM


THE PATIENT THE PINE TREE SEEMS TO LISTEN THE FIR TREE TO WAIT AND BOTH WITHOUT IMPATIENCE THEY DO NOT GIVE A THOUGHT TO THE PETTY HUMAN BEING BELOW WHO IS CONSUMED BY HIS IMPATIENCE AND HIS CURIOSITY




NIETZSCHE IN HIS LATER NOTEBOOKS FROM HE SAYS HE DISAGREES WITH THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION BY NATURAL SELECTION INSTEAD DESCRIBES THE AS THE QUOTE ULTIMATE GROUND AND CHARACTER OF ALL CHANGE

I TEND TO PREJUDICE THAT THE DARWINIAN
SCHOOL HAS DECEIVED ITSELF EVERYWHERE THAT WILL TO POWER IN WHICH I RECOGNIZE THE ULTIMATE
GROUND AND CHARACTER OF ALL CHANGE AGAIN GIVES US THE MEANS TO JUSTIFY WHY THE SELECTION IN
FAVOR OF THE EXCEPTIONS AND GOOD FORTUNE HAS NOT HELD THE STRONGEST AND HAPPIEST ARE WEAK WHEN
THEY ORGANIZED IF THEY HAVE THE TIMIDITY OF THE WEAK THE MAJORITY AGAINST HIM MY
GLOBAL ASPECT GESAMMTASPEKT THE WORLD SHOWS THE VALUES THAT IN THE WHICH ARE HUNG
OVER HUMANITY TODAY WAS NOT THE LUCKY CASES THE SELECTION TYPES THE UPPER HAND BUT THE TYPES OF
DECADENCE PERHAPS THERE IS NOTHING MORE INTERESTING IN THE WORLD AS THIS UNWANTED DRAMA


IN CASE ANYONE WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT CONCEPTS OF HERD INSTINCT AND HERD ANIMAL WERE MERELY POLITICAL METAPHORS ABOVE YOU WILL SEE NIETZSCHE USING THE PHRASE IN AN EXPLICITLY BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT



YOU SHOULD CONSIDER POSTING THIS TO R NIETZSCHE AS WELL
BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL

NIETZSCHE REFERS TO NATIONS FULL OF MEN WHO HAVE AN UNBROKEN STRENGTH OF WILL WHO MILITARILY DEFEATED MORE PEACEFUL RACES WHOSE VITAL FORCE WAS FLICKERING OUT NIETZSCHE THEN EMPHASIZES THIS WAS NOT MERELY THEIR PHYSICAL POWER WHICH ALLOWED A TRIUMPH BUT ALSO WHAT HE CALLS THEIR PSYCHICAL POWER

TO BE SURE ONE MUST NOT RESIGN ONESELF TO
ANY HUMANITARIAN ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE ORIGIN OF AN
ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY THAT IS TO SAY OF THE PRELIMINARY CONDITION FOR
THE ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN THE TRUTH IS HARD LET US ACKNOWLEDGE
UNPREJUDICEDLY HOW EVERY HIGHER CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS ORIGINATED
MEN WITH A STILL NATURAL NATURE BARBARIANS IN EVERY TERRIBLE SENSE OF
THE WORD MEN OF PREY STILL IN POSSESSION OF UNBROKEN STRENGTH OF WILL
AND DESIRE FOR POWER THREW THEMSELVES UPON WEAKER MORE MORAL MORE
PEACEFUL RACES PERHAPS TRADING OR COMMUNITIES OR UPON
OLD MELLOW CIVILIZATIONS IN WHICH THE FINAL VITAL FORCE WAS FLICKERING
OUT IN BRILLIANT FIREWORKS OF WIT AND DEPRAVITY AT THE COMMENCEMENT
THE NOBLE CASTE WAS ALWAYS THE BARBARIAN CASTE THEIR SUPERIORITY DID
NOT CONSIST FIRST OF ALL IN THEIR PHYSICAL BUT IN THEIR PSYCHICAL
WERE MORE COMPLETE MEN WHICH AT EVERY POINT ALSO IMPLIES
THE SAME AS MORE COMPLETE BEASTS




BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL

NIETZSCHE MAKES A BLATANTLY BIOLOGICAL METAPHOR BETWEEN A NATION'S ARISTOCRATIC CLASS AND THE CIPO MATADOR VINES THAT GROW IN JAVA

NIETZSCHE IS MAKING REFERENCE TO THE SPECIES MIKANIA MICRANTHA A TROPICAL VINE THAT GROWS IN INDONESIA IT IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING VINES IN THE WORLD AND IS KNOWN AS AN INVASIVE SPECIES WHEN MIKANIA INVADES TEA PLANTATIONS IT QUICKLY KILLS ALL THE EXISTING PLANTS AND USES THEIR DRYING CORPSES AS ELEVATION TOWARDS SUNLIGHT



THE ESSENTIAL THING HOWEVER IN A GOOD AND HEALTHY ARISTOCRACY IS THAT IT SHOULD NOT REGARD
ITSELF AS A FUNCTION EITHER OF THE KINGSHIP OR THE COMMONWEALTH BUT
AS THE SIGNIFICANCE AND HIGHEST JUSTIFICATION IT SHOULD
THEREFORE ACCEPT WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SACRIFICE OF A LEGION
OF INDIVIDUALS WHO FOR ITS SAKE MUST BE SUPPRESSED AND REDUCED TO
IMPERFECT MEN TO SLAVES AND INSTRUMENTS ITS FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF MUST
BE PRECISELY THAT SOCIETY IS NOT ALLOWED TO EXIST FOR ITS OWN SAKE BUT
ONLY AS A FOUNDATION AND SCAFFOLDING BY MEANS OF WHICH A SELECT CLASS
OF BEINGS MAY BE ABLE TO ELEVATE THEMSELVES TO THEIR HIGHER DUTIES AND
IN GENERAL TO A HIGHER EXISTENCE LIKE THOSE CLIMBING PLANTS
IN ARE CALLED CIPO MATADOR WHICH ENCIRCLE AN OAK SO
LONG AND SO OFTEN WITH THEIR ARMS UNTIL AT LAST HIGH ABOVE IT BUT
SUPPORTED BY IT THEY CAN UNFOLD THEIR TOPS IN THE OPEN LIGHT AND
EXHIBIT THEIR HAPPINESS

NOT ONLY COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE WHOLE OF HUMAN EXISTENCE BUT YOU COULD ALSO PRECISELY PREDICT EVERY EVENT IN IT

THE LATTER PART OF THIS SENTENCE ISN'T ACTUALLY TRUE OR AT LEAST CERTAINLY DOESN'T FOLLOW FROM THE PREMISE SURPRISINGLY KNOWING THE STARTING CONDITIONS AND THE LAWS DOES NOT GUARANTEE PREDICTABILITY AS YOU CAN CONSTRUCT ANALOGOUS SITUATIONS TO THE HALTING PROBLEM FOR ANY PREDICTOR SIMPLY BECAUSE YOUR ACT OF PREDICTION IS OR COULD BE PART OF THE UNIVERSE YOU'RE PREDICTING ANY ALGORITHM YOU FOLLOW TO WORK OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN CAN BE THWARTED BY SOMETHING DEPENDENT ON THAT ALGORITHM'S RESULT IE ANY ALGORITHM A CANNOT WORK OUT WHAT THE RESULT OF SOME BIT OF THE UNIVERSE PERHAPS SOMETHING TAKING ACTION ON YOUR OWN PREDICTION WHICH IS BARRING OUT THE ALGORITHM IF A U X THEN Y ELSE X WHERE U IS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE UNIVERSE




THE FACT THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS IS IS NOT NEARLY AS CUT AND DRY AS THIS POST CLAIMS IT ITS



COPYPASTING MYSELF FROM THIS POST



THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS EXPLANATIONS OF JUST WHAT IS GOING ON WHEN A MEASUREMENT IS MADE AND THE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSES THE MOST POPULAR INTERPRETATION IS THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION WHICH SAYS THAT QM IS TRULY RANDOM AND A QUANTUM SYSTEM JUST SORT OF DECIDES WHAT STATE IT'S IN WHEN A MEASUREMENT IS MADE THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION SAYS THAT EVERY POSSIBLE OBSERVATION HAPPENS BUT IN DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE WAVEFUNCTION OF THE MULTIVERSE OR IN DIFFERENT PARALLEL UNIVERSES AS IT'S SOMETIMES DESCRIBED IN SCIFI SO IN THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION THE ENTIRE MULTIVERSE IS COMPLETELY DETERMINISTIC BUT WHAT BRANCH WE HAPPEN TO FIND OURSELVES IN AFTER A MEASUREMENT IS RANDOM THEN THERE'S THE HIDDEN VARIABLES INTERPRETATION THIS IS THE ONE PEOPLE ARE ADVOCATING FOR WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT WHEN THEY SAY THINGS LIKE WELL MAYBE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF QM JUST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE PREDICTIONS YET THE HIDDEN VARIABLES INTERPRETATION SAYS THAT QM IS ULTIMATELY INCOMPLETE AND THAT A COMPLETE THEORY WOULD PROVIDE DESCRIPTIVE CATEGORIES TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL OBSERVABLE BEHAVIOR AND THUS AVOID ANY INDETERMINISM



WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHICH OF THESE IS CORRECT BUT EVEN IF IT'S HIDDEN VARIABLES AND IT PROBABLY ISN'T SAID VARIABLES CAN NEVER BE USED TO PREDICT OUTCOMES ACCORDING TO BELL'S THEOREM



NO PHYSICAL THEORY OF LOCAL HIDDEN VARIABLES CAN EVER REPRODUCE ALL OF THE PREDICTIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS



OR AS U SICYON PUT IT



BELLS THEOREM PROVES THAT THERE IS NO HIDDEN INFORMATION LIMITED BY THE SPEED OF LIGHT WHICH SECRETLY CONTROLS RANDOMNESS EVEN IN QM SYSTEMS THAT ARE METAPHYSICALLY DETERMINISTIC THEY ARE BEHOLDEN TO BELLS THEOREM ALL MEASUREMENTS ARE RANDOM UNLESS FASTER THAN LIGHT INFORMATION CAN BE PROPAGATED

BASICALLY IF THERE ARE HIDDEN VARIABLES YOU CAN MATHEMATICALLY SHOW THAT EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE THEY SHOULD SHOW CERTAIN STATISTICS THEY DON'T



FURTHER READING

REDDIN ASK SCIENCE CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN HOW EXACTLY BELL'S THEOREM SHOWS QM CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY LOCAL HIDDEN VARIABLES
REDDIN ASK SCIENCE WHY IS THE HIDDEN VARIABLE THEORY INCORRECT
BELL'S THEOREM WITH EASY MATH
WIKIPEDIA SUPERDETERMINISM
SEAN CARROLL WHY THE FORMULATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IS PROBABLY CORRECT
SEAN CARROLL HYPNOTIZED BY QUANTUM MECHANICS
SEAN CARROLL ON DETERMINISM
I'D HAVE TO SEE SOME EVIDENCE THAT RANDOMNESS AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ACTIONS OF LARGER MOLECULES BEFORE I ABANDON MY DETERMINISM IN ADDITION THIS IS NOT SO MUCH AN ARGUMENT AGAINST FREE WILL BUT OF DETERMINISM PRESUMABLY QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL AND WE WOULD STILL BE UNABLE TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF OUR MINDS ETC
IN ESSENCE INFORMATION IS ABOUT WHAT REPEATS IN A PATTERN AND WHAT DOESN TENSE

NUMBER INFORMATION IS PATTERN AND RANDOMNESS IS LACK OF PATTERN INFORMATION IS ANY OBJECTIVE MEANING SOME CONSCIOUS BEING CAN DERIVE FROM SOME KIND OF PATTERN NO PATTERNS MEANS RANDOMNESS OR HOMOGENEITY RANDOMNESS AND HOMOGENEITY HAVE NO OBJECTIVE MEANING AND THUS CONTAIN NO INFORMATION INFORMATION HELICOPTER NO INFORMATION ADJ EUMVZ OR RRRRRRRRRR SAME AMOUNT OF DIGITS BUT ONE MEANS SOMETHING WHILE THE OTHERS MEAN NOTHING DEVELOP A COMMONLY AGREED UPON COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL BASED ON THESE CODE SYMBOLS WHICH CONTAIN NO INFORMATION INDIVIDUALLY OR IN A RANDOM CONFIGURATION AND ARRANGE THEM INTO THINGS CALLED WORDS AND SENTENCES THAT MEAN SOMETHING TO SOMEONE AND YOU THEN HAVE INFORMATION

AN INFINITELY LONG STRING OF ONE DIGIT CONTAINS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION MUCH LESS IN FACT THAN A NON REPEATING FINITE ONE A RANDOM STRING OF DIGITS CONTAINS MAXIMUM INFORMATION AS IT CANNOT BE COMPRESSED IN ANY RELIABLE WAY

BOTH AN INFINITE STRING OF ONE DIGIT AND A RANDOM STRING OF DIGITS CONTAIN NO INFORMATION

THUS INFORMATION IS QUITE A LOT LIKE ORDER AND THE MORE DISORDERLY A SYSTEM IS WHETHER IT S DIGITS IN A NUMBER OR THE POSITIONS OF PARTICLES IN A SUBSTANCE THE MORE INFORMATION IT CONTAINS

THEN THIS DOES NOT FOLLOW ENTROPY AND INFORMATION ARE RELATED BUT NOT IN THIS WAY THE MORE DISORDERLY AN INFORMATION SYSTEM IS THE MORE RANDOM IT IS THUS THE LESS INFORMATION IT CONTAINS AS INFORMATION INCREASES ENTROPY DECREASES ORDER INCREASES

THIS CORRELATION CONTRADICTS WHAT WE INTUITIVELY DEVELOPED PREVIOUSLY DUE TO THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS WHICH TELLS US THAT THE LEVEL OF ENTROPY IN THE UNIVERSE IS INCREASING THUS THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE UNIVERSE IS INCREASING WITH IT

NOPE INFORMATION ENTROPY IS RELATED TO MEANING AND CONSCIOUSNESS NOT THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS





SO GOODBYE FREE WILL BELIEVERS
THAT IS AN EXTENDED FALLACY IF YOU ASSUME THAT THE UNIVERSE ALREADY DETERMINED THEN NO POSSIBLE EVIDENCE YOU ENCOUNTER AFTERWARDS CAN POSSIBLY ALTER THE CONCLUSION
QUANTUM MECHANICS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT A DETERMINISTIC THEORY THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION EVOLVES IN A PURELY DETERMINISTIC FASHION WITH ABSOLUTELY NO RANDOMNESS WHICH OF THE WORLDS THIS DOESN'T ACTUALLY NEED YOU TO BE AN EVERETTIAN IT'S JUST USEFUL TERMINOLOGY YOU END UP IN CANNOT BE PREDICTED FROM THE START THIS IS WHERE THE RANDOMNESS COMES IN BUT THE UNDERLYING EVOLUTION IS DETERMINISTIC THERE IS STILL NO ROOM FOR LIBERTARIAN FREE WILLIAM

THIS IS A COMMON MISTAKE AND IT'S SOMETHING SEAN CARROLL HAS GONE OVER MANY TIMES
THIS IS BS BECAUSE YOU ARE BASICALLY IN CONTROL OF THE OUTPUT WITH SELF DISCIPLINE SUPPORT ETC CONSEQUENCES OF NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTS CAN LEAD TO INCREASES OF FATEFUL CIRCUMSTANCES
WOW DENNETT REALLY LIKED TO TAKE A SMUG STRIDENT TONE IN THESE LETTERS DIDN'T HE I AGREE WITH ALMOST EVERY ACTUAL POINT HE MAKES BUT HERE WE ARE YEARS LATER WE DON'T YET FULLY UNDERSTAND CONSCIOUSNESS AND WE DON'T YET HAVE STRONG AI

SHOTS FIRED AT THE TAOISTS WHERE IS THE COMMENTARY FROM CHUANGTZU
I HAVE ALWAYS DISAGREED WITH THE IDEA THAT COMPASSION AND EMPATHY FOR OTHERS IS ALWAYS NOT FOR SELF-INTEREST THE DEFINITION OF SELF-INTEREST IN THIS ARTICLE IS VERY LIMITED IN MY OPINION AND NOT SUFFICIENT AS AN ARGUMENT THAT PHILOSOPHY IS CORRECT ALSO IDEAS ABOUT SOCIAL RITUAL AND ETIQUETTE BEING HARDWIRED ARE NOT COMPLETELY IMPLAUSIBLE WHEN YOU CONSIDER OTHER PHILOSOPHERS LIKE LOZI UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF WORSHIP AND RITUALS TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL HARMONY REGARDLESS IF THEIR SUPERSTITIOUS ASPECTS WERE FALSE HAVING NOT ACTUALLY READ ANY OF WORKS I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW IF HE LITERALLY MEANT THAT CHINESE ANCESTOR WORSHIP AND RITUALS WERE HARDWIRED IT IS POSSIBLE HE MEANT IT IN A MORE GENERAL SENSE LIKE LOZI
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR EMPHASIZES THAT MENGTZE HAD A FUNCTIONAL PHILOSOPHY OF HOW TO TEACH COMPASSION TO PEOPLE BY EXTENDING THE SPHERES OF CONSIDERATION FROM THE FAMILY TO OTHERS BUT HE DOESN'T EXPLAIN HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING THAT IN THE ARTICLE THAT'S THE THING THAT WOULD MOST INTEREST ME

ALSO DOESN'T THE FINAL RESULT OF THIS EXTENSION OF MORAL HORIZONS FROM NATURAL EMPATHY TO KINGDOM ULTIMATELY BECOME THE MOHIST WESTERN MORALITY ANYWAY
HEY EVERYONE HOPEFULLY I CAN CLARIFY A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT OTHERS ARE HAVING ABOUT VAN PIECE AND THE MENGTZE ITSELF

VAN NORDEN DOES OVERSIMPLIFY A BIT WHEN HE SAYS THAT MENGTZE IS CONCERNED WITH COMPASSION THE EPISODE WITH THE OX ONLY MENTIONS A HEART THAT IS BURENZHIXIN AND THE ONE PLACE WHERE MENGTZE GIVES ANY EXPOSITION ON THE STRUCTURE OF MORALITY SAYS THAT HE'S ONLY CONCERNED WITH FOUR SPROUTS SIDMAN COMMONLY TRANSLATED AS HUMANNESS RIGHTEOUSNESS RITUAL AND WISDOM RENYILIZHI IT'S COMMON FOR COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHERS TO LOOK AT THIS AS A STATEMENT OF COMPASSION BUT WHAT MENGTZE IS REALLY SAYING IS THAT WE HAVE A GENERAL MORAL COMPASS THAT CLASSIFIES EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF THE FOUR SPROUTS TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT SAYING THAT MENGTZE IS AGAINST COMPASSION BUT WHAT HE'S SUGGESTING IS SOMETHING SLIGHTLY MORE SUBTLE

2 IT'S NOT THAT MENGTZE THINKS THAT MATERIAL GOODS ARE UNIMPORTANT IN SEVERAL PASSAGES HE SUGGESTS THAT THE POLITY NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IN TERMS OF THEIR DAILY NEEDS HOWEVER HE DOES THINK THAT MORAL PERFECTION CAN OCCUR INDEPENDENT OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP UNLIKE ARISTOTLE WHO ACCEPTS THAT SOME ARE JUST DOOMED TO MEDIOCRITY

I'VE READ SOME OF VAN OTHER WORKS AND HE'S MUCH MORE METICULOUS THAN HIS ARTICLE SUGGESTS HE'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FEW SCHOLARS WHO HAS TRANSLATED THE MENGTZE AND HIS WORK IS VERY POPULAR WITH VIRTUE ETHICISTS

SOURCE I'M A RESEARCH ASSISTANT FOR ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES AND I'VE PUBLISHED AN ESSAY ON THE VERY PASSAGES IN THE MENGTZE HE DISCUSSES IF ANYONE WANTS A COPY I'D BE DOWN TO SHARE IT
AND THEN THERE IS GUENZI THE 3RD MOST IMPORTANT CONFUCIAN PHILOSOPHER WHO DISAGREED WITH MENGTZE ON THE NATURE OF HUMAN NATURE ACCORDING TO HIM WE ARE BORN BAD AND NEED EDUCATION TO GROW UP INTO DECENT HUMAN BEINGS THEN HIS STUDENT HAN FEI RAN WITH THAT AND CREATED LEGALISM WHERE INSTEAD OF IN ADDITION TO EDUCATION WE REQUIRE DRACONIAN PUNISHMENT FOR A FUNCTIONING SOCIETY
HAD TO STOP READING THE REPRESENTATION OF ARISTOTLE AND PLATO IS BEYOND SHALLOW
WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT THIS ACT REQUIRES BOTH A VICTIM AND A PERPETRATOR

I THINK YOU'RE MISSING THAT IT'S STILL UP FOR DEBATE IF THE ROBOTS CAN BE EITHER OF THOSE WITHOUT GENUINE AGENCY YOU HAVEN'T ESTABLISHED THAT IF WE TAKE THE SHOW AT ITS WORD AT FIRST IN THE CASE OF ONE ROBOT PROGRAMMED TO RAPE ANOTHER ROBOT NEITHER WOULD BE A VICTIM OR PERPETRATOR IN THE SENSE REQUIRED TO CHARGE SOMEONE WITH COMMITTING A CRIME THERE IS NO SOMEONE THE ROBOTS ARE PROGRAMMED TO DO AN EXACT THING LIKE A CARTOON IS DRAWN TO PLAY OUT IN AN EXACT WAY THE ROBOTS DON'T HAVE SENTIENCE ANYMORE THAN SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS DOES OR SO THE SHOW FIRST LEADS TO BELIEVE THAT CONCEPT OF KICKSTARTING CONSCIOUSNESS REVEALED IN THE LAST EPISODE I THINK IS THE GAME CHANGER

BUT OF COURSE ALL THIS GLOSSES OVER THE DETERMINISM COMPATIBILISM LIBERTARIAN ARGUMENT OVER WHAT WE EVEN MEAN BY FREE WILL AND TO WHAT DEGREE WE ASSIGN MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE FIRST PLACE I DOUBT THE SHOW WILL GET INTO THAT I DON'T SEE HOW IT COULD BE WORKED INTO THE PLOT HONESTLY


WE'RE CLAIMING THAT THE ACT OF RAPING THE DAUGHTER ROBOT IS ALWAYS MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE IN NO CASE IS IT A MORALLY ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

WHY IS IT MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE IF I THROW A FURBY IN THE TRASH IS THAT MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE WHAT IF I ATTACH A SEX TOY TO A SIMPLE ENGINE

THESE ROBOTS AREN'T INTELLIGENT THEY'RE SIMULATING INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR EVEN IF IT TURNS OUT THEY CAN LEARN AND CHANGE BEHAVIOR BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCE IT'S NOT A TRUE AI ONCE IT IS THEN SURE YOU'VE GOT A TRUE ETHICAL DILEMMA UNTIL THAT POINT NO DILEMMA EXISTS
I WOULD SAY THE RAPIST ROBOT IS NOT AT FAULT SINCE IT ULTIMATELY DOES IT JUST BECAUSE IT IS PROGRAMED TO WW SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE GIRL THO SINCE SHE SHOOTS THE RAPIST DESPITE NOT BEING AUTHORIZED TO USE WEAPONS SHE MAY BE DEVELOPING FREE WILLIAM ALTHOUGH SHE DOES HEAR A VOICE IN HER HEAD SAY SHOOT HIM THIS COULD BE HER INNER THOUGHTS OR PERHAPS SOME OTHER TYPE OF PROGRAMMING MAYBE A METAPHOR FOR ALL THE EXTERNAL FORCES IN OUR LIVES THAT SUBTLY PUSH US TO MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES EITHER WAY IT'S A COOL SHOW
IT'S NOT VERY USEFUL TO JUDGE WHETHER OR NOT THE ROBOT IS MORAL OR NOT ULTIMATELY THE PURPOSE OF MORALITY IS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM DOING THINGS THAT DAMAGE OTHERS BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK IN YOUR SCENARIO BECAUSE IN A REAL DETERMINISTIC ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE'S ACTIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY EXTERNAL FORCES WHERE IN YOUR CONCEPTUAL SCENARIO IT IS DEFINED SUCH THAT THE SAME PATTERN WILL REPEAT NO MATTER WHAT

THE ROBOT AS YOU'VE DEFINED IT WILL ACTIVELY FIGHT AGAINST ANY ATTEMPTS TO DIVERT HIM YOU CAN OFFER THE ROBOT ALL THE MONEY AND WOMEN IN THE WORLD TO NOT RAPE THE GIRL AND THREATEN TO KILL IT IF IT DECLINES AND IT WILL STILL GO RAPE THE GIRL

FOR THAT MATTER YOU CAN INCINERATE THE ROBOT AND SHOOT IT'S REMAINS INTO SPACE AND IT WILL STILL RAPE THE GIRL BECAUSE THE ROBOT ONLY EXISTS IN THIS CONCEPTUAL WORLD WHERE BY DEFINITION IT RAPES THE GIRL EVERY DAY AND THAT WORLD DOESN'T CARE ABOUT SILLY THINGS SUCH AS EXTERNAL FORCES
THIS IS MORE COMPLEX THEN IT SEEMED ON THE SURFACE MY KNEE JERK WAS TO SAY NO CHOICE NO RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEN I GOT PONDERING WHAT I MEANT BY MORAL AND THAT GOT ME PONDERING WHAT I MEANT BY RESPONSIBILITY
MORAL CONNOTES DISCERNMENT OF RIGHT FROM WRONG AND RESPONSIBILITY IMPLIES BEING THE CAUSE
BUT IF YOU CAN'T BE THE ROOT CAUSE WITHOUT MAKING A CHOICE IF I PUSH YOU OFF A BUILDING AND YOU LAND ON SOMEONE AND KILL THEM YOU CAUSED THEIR DEATH BUT YOU AREN'T THE ROOT CAUSE I AM
SO THE RESPONSIBILITY LIES WITH THE PROGRAMMER
IT'S A TRITE AND DERIVATIVE SHOW IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MORAL PROBLEMS OF ROBOTS BECOMING SENTIENT YOU'D DO BETTER TO DISCUSS THE PLAY ROYAL U R IN WHICH THE WORD ROBOT FIRST APPEARED OR THE ROBOT STORIES OF ISAAC ASIMOV OR THE COLLECTED WORKS OF PHILIP KING DICK OR THE MOVIES FORBIDDEN PLANET AND BLADE RUNNER WESTWORLD IS AT BEST A MISHMASH OF IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPLORED FAR MORE INTELLIGENTLY IN MANY OTHER WORKS OF SPECULATIVE FICTION GOING BACK A CENTURY

FROM

THE PLAY BEGINS IN A FACTORY THAT MAKES ARTIFICIAL PEOPLE CALLED ROBOT ROBOTS FROM SYNTHETIC ORGANIC MATTER THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY ROBOTS BY THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF THE TERM THESE CREATURES ARE CLOSER TO THE MODERN IDEA OF CYBORGS ANDROIDS OR EVEN CLONES AS THEY MAY BE MISTAKEN FOR HUMANS AND CAN THINK FOR THEMSELVES THEY SEEM HAPPY TO WORK FOR HUMANS AT FIRST BUT A ROBOT REBELLION LEADS TO THE EXTINCTION OF THE HUMAN RACE

FOR THAT MATTER WE HAVE THE LEGEND OF PYGMALION IN WHICH A SCULPTOR FALLS IN LOVE WITH A STATUE FROM WIKIPEDIA

THE STORY OF THE BREATH OF LIFE IN A STATUE HAS PARALLELS IN THE EXAMPLES OF DAEDALUS WHO USED QUICKSILVER TO INSTALL A VOICE IN HIS STATUES OF HEPHAESTUS WHO CREATED AUTOMATA FOR HIS WORKSHOP OF TALOS AN ARTIFICIAL MAN OF BRONZE AND ACCORDING TO HESIOD OF PANDORA WHO WAS MADE FROM CLAY AT THE BEHEST OF ZEUS
THE MORAL ANECDOTE OF THE PEGA OF NABIS RECOUNTED BY THE HISTORIAN POLYBIUS DESCRIBED A SUPPOSED MECHANICAL SIMULACRUM OF THE TYRANT'S WIFE THAT CRUSHED VICTIMS IN HER EMBRACE
THE TROPE OF A SCULPTURE SO LIFELIKE THAT IT SEEMED ABOUT TO MOVE WAS A COMMONPLACE WITH WRITERS ON WORKS OF ART IN ANTIQUITY THIS TROPE WAS INHERITED BY WRITERS ON ART AFTER THE RENAISSANCE

WIKI PYGMALION MYTHOLOGY

WESTWORLD IS A HUNDRED RED HERRINGS IN SEARCH OF A PLOT IMO IT'S PRETTY WEAK SAUCE FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT FOR ONE THING THE SHOW RUNNERS REFUSE TO TAKE A STAND TO COMMIT TO ONE STORY LINE OR ONE CORE PLOT IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE IT'S R STONERPHILOSOPHY NOT PHILOSOPHY IF ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT FICTIONAL EXPLORATIONS OF THE MORAL QUESTIONS OF MACHINE SENTIENCE THERE ARE FAR MORE COMPELLING AND COHERENT STORIES TO CHOOSE FROM

THERE IS OF COURSE A FLOURISHING SUBREDDIT R WESTWORLD IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN DISCUSS THE INTELLECTUAL CONTENT AND VARIOUS FAN THEORIES THE MAN IN BLACK IS WILLIAM THE MAN IN BLACK IS ARNOLD BERNARD IS ARNOLD FORD IS ARNOLD BERNARD IS A ROBOT FORD IS A ROBOT THERE ARE TWO TIMELINES THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO TIMELINES THE STAFF ARE ROBOTS THE GUESTS ARE ROBOTS THE ROBOTS ARE ACTUALLY HUMAN CLONED FROM GUEST DNA IT NEVER ENDS AND IT'S NOT PHILOSOPHY

BY THE WAY NOBODY EVER RAPES DOLORES SHE'S A RESCUE OBJECT NOT A RAPE OBJECT HER PURPOSE IS TO BE MENACED BY OTHER ROBOTS SO THAT WHITE KNIGHT MALE GUESTS CAN SAVE HERALDRY IT'S CLEAR BY NOW THAT THE MAN IN BLACK DRAGGED HER INTO THE BARN TO REPROGRAM HER OR FIND A CLUE TO THE MAZE NOT TO RAPE HERALDRY

JEEZ MAN I GET ENOUGH OF THIS ON THE WESTWORLD SUB NOT HERE PLEASE I COME TO THE PHILOSOPHY SUB TO ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING

I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH FOUR PARAGRAPHS JUST TO FIND OUT WHO IS BEING INTERVIEWED

WHAT'S WITH THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION IN ARGUMENT THAT THE UNIVERSE IN WHICH THE SIMULATION WE MAY INHABIT IS BEING RUN IS EQUALLY AS COMPLEX AS OURS

WE HAVE ONE BASELINE FOR THE COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF WORLDS THE ONE WE HAPPEN TO FIND OURSELVES IN THERE'S NO BROADER SET TO EMPLOY COMPARISONS FROM WE JUST ARE IN A WORLD THAT ENJOYS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY

WHY MUST OUR UNIVERSE BE AN ACCURATE SIMULATION OF THE REAL UNIVERSE PERHAPS MERELY THE NEXT ONE UP A LONG CHAIN OF SIMULATION MAYBE WE'RE JUST FARMVILLE TO GOD WHO IN TURN IS A SIM

SHORT OF A BREAKDOWN IN THE RULES OF PHYSICS THAT INDICATES SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON LIKE AN INSTANCE RESET WARNING FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN'T EVER GET A POINT OF COMPARISON THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO GATHER EVIDENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

IS THIS ARTICLE HORRIBLY MISREPRESENTING THE ORIGINAL ARGUMENT
REMOVED
REMOVED
NOT A BAD ARTICLE

YET HERE S ANOTHER HUGE ASSUMPTION MUSK HAS TO BUILD IN MUSK HAS TO BELIEVE HUMAN BEINGS WILL ARRIVE AT A POINT WHERE CONSCIOUSNESS CONSCIOUSNESS NOT A CHEAP IMITATION CAN BE REPLICATED WITHIN A SIMULATION
BUT CONSCIOUSNESS REMAINS A MYSTERY FOR A REASON MUSK NOT ONLY BELIEVES FUTURE CIVILIZATIONS WILL SOLVE WHAT DAVID CHALMERS FAMOUSLY CALLED THE HARD PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THAT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF CONSCIOUSNESS WILL BE SO TOTAL THEY LL BE ABLE TO EFFORTLESSLY REPLICATE IT WITHOUT LIMIT

I DON'T THINK ONE NECESSARY HAS TO HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE HARD PROBLEM IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A SIMULATION WE CAN ALREADY CREATE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCES BY STIMULATING THE BRAIN SO IT IS FORESEEABLE THAT WE CAN COME TO A COMPLETE OR NEAR COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND USE THAT INFORMATION TO BUILD OUR SIMULATION BUT WHAT ISN'T CLEAR IS WHAT EXACTLY IS MEANT HERE BY SIMULATION

I M A THEIST IF I WERE TO ADOPT MUSK S CATEGORIES I WOULD SAY THAT GOD IS THE DESIGNER AND HE S RUN JUST ONE SIMULATION EVEN THOUGH HE S CONSIDERED ALL LOGICALLY POSSIBLE SIMULATIONS IN HIS MIND WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK CONSCIOUSNESS MAKES LOTS OF SENSE THERE IS A RICHNESS THAT IT FURNISHES US WITH EVEN IF STRICTLY SPEAKING IT S A METAPHYSICAL THAT WE COULD HAVE DONE ENTIRELY WITHOUT

I DON'T SEE HOW CONSCIOUSNESS MAKES SENSE IN THIS FRAMEWORK FOR A THEIST THE SAME PROBLEMS SEEM TO CARRY OVER FOR WHY GOD CREATED PHENOMENAL CONSCIOUS BEINGS AND NOT JUST ACCESS CONSCIOUS BEINGS
STOP HOLY HELL CAN WE PLEASE STOP PUSHING THIS THIS WHOLE CONCEPT IS WAY MORE RELIGIOUS THAN IT IS PHILOSOPHICAL THE ENTIRE WORLD ISN'T NECESSARILY FOUNDED ON PURE LOGIC AND FOR THE PAST CENTURY QUANTUM MECHANICS HAS SHOWN US THAT REALITY AT BOTTOM GETS PRETTY WEIRD VIOLATION OF BELL'S INEQUALITY

THE WORLD BEING A SIMULATION IS JUST THE SAME AS SAYING THE WORLD IS FULL OF GHOSTS AND SPIRITS DOES IT CHANGE ANYTHING OR IS IT JUST MAKING YOU FEEL GOOD BECAUSE YOU HAVE A COMPUTER GAME FETISH
REMOVED
REMOVED
MY AV THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TOPIC GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS DISCLOSURE I'M STEALING THIS FROM SOMEWHERE BUT CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE

OK SO FIRST DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HUMANS WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE SIMULATIONS SIMILAR TO OUR CURRENT FORM OF LIFE THE UNIVERSE WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT ANY INTELLIGENT PERSON WILL NATURALLY SAY YES WE WILL LIKELY WITHIN THE NEXT YEARS

SO ASSUMING HUMANS WILL INDEED CREATE LIFE LIKE SIMULATIONS THAT LEAVES TWO SIMPLE POSSIBILITIES

WE ARE IN THE ORIGINAL LIFE LINE AND WE HAVEN'T REACHED THE POINT IN WHICH SIMULATIONS WERE CREATED
OR THE MUCH MORE LIKELY POSSIBILITY
2 WE ARE WITHIN ONE OF THE INFINITE POTENTIAL SIMULATIONS


IT'S SO SIMPLE AND HARD FOR ME TO REASON AGAINST
REMOVED
REMOVED
MY RESPONSE TO THIS IS THE SAME AS MY RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEM OF HARD SOLIPSISM

THESE SCENARIOS DON'T MATTER FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE AND THEREFORE FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE NO ONE SHOULD CARE ABOUT IT EVEN IF IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE

HERE'S WHY

FOR ONE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE SECONDLY EVEN IF THERE WAS EVIDENCE AND WE KNEW WE WERE STUCK IN THE MATRIX AS IT WERE IF THERE'S NO WAY TO ESCAPE IT INTO THE REAL WORLD IT STILL DOESN'T MATTER

I'M STILL STUCK IN THIS REALITY AND FORCED TO PLAY BY ITS RULES EVEN IF THE REALITY ITSELF IS FAKE

THUS FROM A PRACTICAL AND PRAGMATIC STANDPOINT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE WORLD I'M IN IS REAL OR NOT I'M STILL STUCK HERE STILL HAVE TO LIVE MY LIFE AND STILL CONSTRAINED BY THE FAKE RULES

SO I DON'T REALLY CARE IF IT'S A SIMULATION OR NOT IT MEANS NOTHING IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THEMES

NOW IF THE PERSON PROPOSING THIS CAN GIVE ME SOME MEANS OF LEAVING SAID FAKE REALITY THEN WE SHOULD START CARING

UNTIL THEN NO ONE SHOULD CARE
WE EVOLVED FROM SIMPLE ORGANISMS WE ARE BORN INTO THIS WORLD AND WE LEARN THROUGH OBSERVATION WE REPEAT WHAT WE HAVE HEARD WE LEARN LANGUAGE SLANG ACCENTS THROUGH OBSERVATION WE ARE BASICALLY VERY INTELLIGENT PARROTS ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HUMANS AND WHAT WE THINK OF AS A I IS THAT WE HAVE PERSONAL PREFERENCES WE PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT WE LIKE AND DISLIKE THERE ARE NO UNIVERSAL SET PARAMETERS THERE ARE POINTS OF RANDOMIZATION FOR HUMANS
WHAT I DON'T GET IS IF WE WERE LIVING IN A VIDEO GAME WHY WOULD THE CREATORS MAKE EVERYTHING DIE WHERE'S THEIR IN
REMOVED
WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE NATURE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS THEY ARE EERILY SIMILAR TO THE WAY INFORMATION WORKS IN A TYPICAL GAME OR SIMULATION PERSONALLY I THINK QUANTUM MECHANICS ARE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT REALITY IS SOME TYPE OF SIMULATED ENVIRONMENT DUE TO EXPERIMENTS LIKE THE QUANTUM ERASER PROVING THAT DATA ONLY BECOMES KNOWN WHEN MEASURED EVEN IF AT ONE POINT SOMETHING OR SOMEONE KNEW BUT THE INFORMATION WAS ERASED QUANTUM MECHANICS IS NEVER WRONG AND WE CAN'T TRICK IT PAST DATA CAN ONLY BECOME REALITY WHEN THE PRESENT ATTEMPTS TO VIEW THE DATA OTHERWISE THE SIMULATION SO TO SPEAK HAS NO NEED TO RENDER THE INFORMATION
ELON MUSK IS THIS STEVE JOBS

DOES NONE OF THE WORK BUT RECEIVES ALL OF THE CREDIT THE REAL HEROES OF SPACE AND TESLA ARE THEIR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS
SEEMS MORE LIKE THE LANGUAGE AND REASONING USED TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION IS A GAME
I DOUBT THE CORE OF REALITY CAN BE ENGLISHED
IN A SIMULATION HOW DOES ONE ACCOUNT FOR RANDOMNESS ISN'T RANDOMNESS AN IMPORTANT PART OF BASE REALITY
WHAT POPS AT ME IMMEDIATELY IS THIS ISN'T THERE AT LEAST ONE MORE LAYER THAT CAN BE ADDED TO THIS DEMON ARGUMENT

WHO SAYS DEMON JUST TRICKS YOU INTO SENSING X OR Y OR BELIEVING YOU ARE DOING SO THE ARGUMENT HOLDS THAT ALTHOUGH YOUR SENSES COULD BE LYING TO YOU SINCE YOU ARE THINKING YOU EXIST

WHAT IF THIS DEMON WAS IN FACT FOOLING YOU INTO JUST BELIEVING YOU WERE THINKING AND THAT THOSE THOUGHTS THAT ARE LEADING YOU TO THE CONCLUSION THAT YOU EXIST ARE NOT YOURS AT ALL
EVEN IF THEY DO HOWEVER IT COULD BE THAT AN AGREEMENT AMONG SOCIETIES IS PUT IN PLACE DISALLOWING ANY SIMULATIONS TO BE RUN

YEAH THE PEOPLE IN THE SAME SOCIETY THAT POSSES THE GREATEST AI TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND AT THE SAME TIME CONSTANTLY WARNS US OF THE THREAT OF AI DOES IT STOP US NUMBER
REMOVED
SO THE SITUATION I COULD UNDERSTAND IS IF WE CAN SIMULATE REALITY AS COMPUTING POWER INCREASES EXPONENTIALLY WOULD IT JUST BE USEFUL IN GENERAL TO SIMULATE MILLIONS OF WORLDS AT ACCELERATED RATES TO STUDY EVOLUTION AND WHAT CERTAIN CHOICES HAVE ON OUR CURRENT REALITY LIKE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE CHANGE OR CHEMICAL LEVELS ON ENVIRONMENTS

LIKE A UNIVERSAL NEW WAY TO MODEL DATA AND CALCULATE NEW DATA THAT COULD BE SO SOPHISTICATED IT'S US EMOTIONAL CONSCIOUS US
IF YOU THINK THIS IS INTERESTING I'D DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS SHORT STORY

NO WE ARE NOT WE ARE LIVING WHERE THERE ARE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES AND SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NOTHING AND EVERYTHING THE UNINTELLIGIBLE INTELLIGENCE DECIDED THAT THE WORLD WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING IS THE MOST LOGICAL ONE A DREAM IS A MUCH BETTER SUITED DESCRIPTION IF THIS DREAM STOPS MAKING SENCE I O STOPS BEING LOGICAL IT GIVES WAY TO A NEW MORE STABLE AND LOGICAL DREAM CALLING REALITY A VIDEO GAME IS IN A WAY OF SEPARATING US PEOPLE FROM THE REST OF CREATION AND AGAIN GIVING RISE TO THE NOTION OF A SEPARATED GOD SPIRIT PROGRAMMER ETC BEEFING IN CONTROL OF THE WHOLE THING RESULTING IN SEPARATION AND RELIGIONS WE ARE THE DREAMER AND AS WE COLLECT MORE AND MORE INFORMATION GET TO KNOW OUR SELVES OUR REALITY BECOMES MORE LOGICAL MORE STABLE MORE REAL

IT STILL REMAINS THAT IN ORDER FOR THE CONCEPT TO BE PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD AND RESEARCHED IT MUST BE RULED IN I EAST TAKEN SERIOUSLY OTHER LESS TENABLE THEORIES LIKE STRING THEORY ARE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND RULED IN AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY WORKING MODELS WITH WHICH TO COMPARE IT AT LEAST WE CAN LOGICALLY MODEL REALITY AS A SIMULATION BASED ON OUR MANY THOUSANDS OF SIMULATIONS THAT ARE IMPROVING EVERY DAY

REALITY IS ALREADY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A SIMULATION ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW PROBABILISTIC SIMULATIONS WORK

BUT MUSK IS NOT A SCIENTIST AND SO HE IS LIMITED IN HIS UNDERSTANDING A THEORY OF REALITY AS A SIMULATION DOES A BETTER JOB OF EXPLAINING SO CALLED PHYSICAL PHENOMENA BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MOREOVER NOVEL TESTS CAN BE DEVISED UNDER SUCH A THEORY PROVIDING EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE NO OTHER MODEL OF REALITY CAN DO THAT WE WILL HAVE SUCH EXPERIMENTS AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE

REALITY AS A SIMULATION BEING RULED IN IS NO LESS REMARKABLE THAN EARTH AS A SPHERE OR HELIOCENTRICISM BEING RULED IN IT IS TESTABLE CAN MAKE PREDICTIONS AND WILL BE VERIFIED WITHIN A DECADE THOSE WHO BELIEVE REALITY IS NOT A SIMULATION WILL BE SEEN AS FLAT CAROTHERS ARE TODAY THIS ARTICLE REMINDS ME OF THE REACTION TO THOMAS YOUNGS WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT OTHER SCIENTISTS WORKED HARD TO DISCREDIT HIM EVEN THOUGH HE WAS RIGHT AND EVEN AFTER HE PROVED IT EXPERIMENTALLY EVERYONE HAS BELIEFS EVEN SCIENTISTS

WHAT IS MOST IRRATIONAL IS THE INGRAINED DEFAULT NAIVE BELIEF THAT THIS IS A PHYSICAL REALITY NOT A SIMULATION AND THAT BEING RULED IN EVEN THOUGH HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF SCIENCE HAS FAILED TO DISCOVER ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT

OH AND YOU ARE THE PLAYER
DELETED
REMOVED
SO VIDEO GAMES RECREATE REALITY SO NOW THAT MEANS REALITY MUST BE A VIDEO GAME WHAT
HEARD THIS ARGUMENT SO MANY TIMES AND EACH TIME NO ONE ADDRESSES MY MAYBE I AM JUST FLAWED IN MY REASONING

IN ORDER TO SIMULATE AN ELECTRON YOU ARE GOING TO NEED MORE THAN ONE ELECTRON TO DO IT THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL YOU CAN NOT CREATE A PERFECT SIMULATION OF ANYTHING THAT HAS LESS MASS THAN THE THING YOU PLAN TO SIMULATE WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT FOR OUR UNIVERSE TO BE A SIMULATION THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A HIGHER UNIVERSE THAT IS BIGGER IF YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A LIMIT OF SAY PARTICLES NEEDED TO SIMULATE ONE PARTICLE THAT WOULD MEAN THE COMPUTER OUR UNIVERSE RUNS ON IS THE SIZE OF OUR OWN WHICH IS ABSURD TO EVEN CONTEMPLATE

NO HUMAN BEING WOULD MAKE A UNIVERSE SIMULATOR THAT RESEMBLES OUR UNIVERSE ABOUT OF WHAT EXISTS IS IN A FORM OF ENERGY MATTER THAT ONLY INTERACTS VIA GRAVITY WE ONLY KNOW IT IS THERE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE GALAXIES MOVE IF YOU WERE GOING TO SIMULATE A UNIVERSE YOU COULD GET THE EXACT SAME EFFECT WE HAVE JUST BY INCREASING THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT SLIGHTLY AND IT WOULD TAKE A LOT LESS EFFORT TO SIMULATE WHY WOULD ANY HUMAN BEING NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OF THE REMAINING OF WHAT EXISTS OF THE UNIVERSE IS IN HYDROGEN PLASMA WHY WOULD ANY HUMAN BEING DO THAT IF WE WERE A PLASMA SIMULATOR WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A LOT LESS STARS BUT OF A LOT MORE CONFIGURATIONS WHICH WE DO NOT SEE WE WOULD ALSO EXPECT TO SEE OF THE MATTER NOT OF IN PLASMA FORM IF THE GOAL OF THE SIMULATION WERE TO HAVE LIFE-BEARING PLANETS WHY NOT CHANGE THE STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE CONSTANT SLIGHTLY AND FREE UP A LOT OF THAT FOR PLANETS IF THE GOAL WERE TO MAKE LIFE BEARING PLANETS WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PLANTS CONFINED TO THE CENTER OF THE GALAXY WHERE LIFE DOESNT LOOK TO BE POSSIBLE WHY FURZY AROUND WITH BLACK-HOLE RED DWARFS BLUE STARS WHEN NONE OF THEM CAN SUPPORT LIFE BASED ON THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE THERE IS NO MOTIVATION BEHIND HOW CREATION IS SETUP AND IN FACT THE OPPOSITE DUE TO RISING ENTROPY THE UNIVERSE GETS LESS FASCINATING EVERY MOMENT SO WHAT HUMAN WOULD BUILD ONE LIKE IT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ALMOST NO EFFORT TO MAKE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM FILLED WITH HUNDREDS OF LIFE-BEARING WORLD FOR EXAMPLE

IF YOU ASSUME THAT AN ALIEN CRITTER BUILT OUR UNIVERSE AND THEIR ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND I WOULD ASK YOU IF THERE ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY DO YOU ASSUME THEY WOULD BE MOTIVATED TO BUILD A UNIVERSE US HUMANS WOULD HAVE A GOAL LIKE THAT ONCE WE HAVE THROWN OUT UNDERSTANDABLE MOTIVATIONS WHY KEEP ONE

EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS REQUIRE EXTRAORDINARY PROOF WE HAVE NOT A HINT OF EVIDENCE THAT THE UNIVERSE IS SIMULATED ALL WE REALLY HAVE IS INFERENCE FROM WHAT WE THINK THE FUTURE HOLDS ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE MOUNTAINS OF EVIDENCE THAT NOT ONLY ARE THE LAWS OF PHYSICS RIGID AND CONSISTENT THAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO WE CAN OBSERVE PULSARS THAT ARE SO FAR APART THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND SEE THAT THEY BOTH OBEY THE SAME LAWS

WHATS MORE BECAUSE OF ARCHEOLOGY GEOLOGY THE SPEED OF LIGHT BACKGROUND RADIATION OF THE UNIVERSE GENETICS WE KNOW THAT EVEN WHEN WE DO NOT OBSERVE STUFF IT STILL EXISTS MEANING THAT OUR HYPOTHETICAL ALIENS THAT MADE OUR UNIVERSE CAN NOT POSSIBLE BE ONLY SIMULATING STUFF WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT IT
I AM ACTUALLY SURPRISED WITH THE ARTICLE DID NOT EXPECT THE PIECE TO BE SO DETAILED IN TRYING TO TACKLE NEW S SIMULATION IDEA I FOUND IT A GOOD PIECE IN TERMS OF SHOWING A TRAIL OF THOUGHT THAT LED TO MUSK SAYING WHAT HE IS SAYING EVEN IF IT AFFECTED HIM UNCONSCIOUSLY

BUT ITS LAST TWO PARAGRAPHS

IF I WERE TO ADOPT MUSK S CATEGORIES I WOULD SAY THAT GOD IS THE DESIGNER AND HE S RUN JUST ONE SIMULATION EVEN THOUGH HE S CONSIDERED ALL LOGICALLY POSSIBLE SIMULATIONS IN HIS MIND

SO HE CONSIDERED ALL POSSIBLE SIMULATIONS AND THIS IS THE ONE HE SETTLED WITH I MEAN REALLY

WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK CONSCIOUSNESS MAKES LOTS OF SENSE THERE IS A RICHNESS THAT IT FURNISHES US WITH EVEN IF STRICTLY SPEAKING IT S A METAPHYSICAL THAT WE COULD HAVE DONE ENTIRELY WITHOUT

YEAH NO

IF LIFE IS A VIDEO GAME AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE ON THE PLANET IT MAKES ANY UNETHICAL DECISION'S RESULTING COGNITIVE DISSONANCE FOR KNOWING YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT BUT DID A LOT EASIER TO IGNORE

IT'S ALL JUST A SIMULATION AFTER ALL

I DISAGREE THAT EITHER WE BECOME GODS OR DIE OFF AS HIS FINAL THOUGHT IMPLIED THERE CAN BE A MIDDLE GROUND WHERE WE FIND WHAT THE REAL LIMITS OF HUMAN EXISTENCE ARE

EITHER WE WILL MAKE A SIMULATION THAT IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM REALITY OR DIE OFFICIAL

THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THOSE WHO THINK THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE AND THOSE WHO DON'T
REMOVED
ELON LIKES ATTENTION BUT SO DOES THE AUTHOR

HIS ARGUMENT AGAINST IDEA IS AT ONE POINT

IT SEEMS HIGHLY UNLIKELY GOD WOULD ALLOW HIS CREATION TO REACH A POINT WHERE THEIR CREATIVE POWERS ARE FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT TO HIS OWN

BUT WE ARE ON TRACK TO DO JUST THAT LIKELY WITHIN OUR LIFETIMES CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT WILL HAVE CREATIVE POWERS NOT JUST EQUIVALENT TO OUR OWN BUT FAR BEYOND OUR OWN

IF WE SUCCEED IN DOING THIS BEFORE WE ARE WIPED OUT BY SOME THING ELSE THEN WOULDN'T IT BE THIS THING WE HAVE CREATED THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIMULATION AND NOT PPL LIKE US

COME ON ELON THIS IS PLAY

NOW GIVE ME SOME FREE SOLAR SHINGLES A POWER WALL AND A TESLA


GOD IS THE MAIN DEVELOPER WHO IS A SUPREME AI CREATED BY AN INTELLIGENT SPECIES POSSIBLY HUMANS NOW CAN SOMEONE POINT HOW THIS ARGUMENT CAN'T BE TRUE
I BELIEVE IN THE SIMULATION THEORY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT MEANS OUR REALITY ISN'T REAL I WANT TO BREAK DOWN THE THREE PREMISES AS LOGICALLY AND SIMPLY AS I CAN


OUR TECHNOLOGY NOTABLY IN GAME DEVELOPMENT IS PROGRESSING AT A RATE THAT SUGGESTS IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME COSMIC BLINK OF AN EYE UNTIL WE ACHIEVE SIMULATIONS THAT SEEM LIKE REALITY


2 GAMING COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY IS MASS PRODUCED EACH DEVICE CAPABLE OF RUNNING AT LEAST ONE INDEPENDENT INSTANCE OF A PROGRAM OR GAME AKA SIMULATION OR ARBITRARY


WHEN THE OF IS ACHIEVED AN INCOMPREHENSIBLY LARGE NUMBER OF INSTANCES OF CAN BE RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY THE CHANCE THAT WE'RE IN THE ONE TRUE ORIGINAL REALITY AS OPPOSED TO A IS IN IT'S LIKE WINNING THE BIGGEST LOTTERY JACKPOT IN ALL EXISTENCE AND PERSONALLY I DON'T BELIEVE WE WON THAT LOTTERY
WOULDN'T THIS BASICALLY SHIT ON EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE UNLESS HE'S SAYING THAT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE FROM THE START OF THE BIG BANG IS STIMULATED IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE IT'S NOT LIKE WE WERE SPAWNED HERE WE'VE DATED THE EARTH AND FIGURED OUT THAT MANY MANY SPECIES OF LESS INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY HAVE COME AND GONE BEFORE US AND LED UP TO US
ASSUMING WE WILL NEVER HAVE THE MEANS TO DETECT OR BE OUTSIDE OF A SIMULATION FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES WE ARE NOT IN A SIMULATION
I NEED TO RECATCH MATRIX AFTER THIS
SO I FEEL LIKE AN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT INFINITELY POWERFUL COMPUTATIONAL EQUIPMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE

YES IT WOULD VIOLATE SO MUCH OF PHYSICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE TO HAVE A MACHINE THAT HAS UNLIMITED WORKING SPACE AND PERFORMS INFINITELY MANY OPERATIONS PER SECOND BUT AT THE LEVEL OF METAPHYSICS THIS IS WORTH CONSIDERING

AT THAT LEVEL THERE IS NO HARD PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS JUST REPLICATION OF THE PHYSICAL BRAINS WHICH HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS AS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY OF THEIR CHEMICAL WORKINGS
I FEEL SORRY FOR WHOEVER GOT STUCK PLAYING MY VIDEO GAME TALK ABOUT MONOTONY
GIVEN THE BERGSTEIN BOUND SIMULATING ALL THIS WOULD TAKE ENERGY AND STORAGE BEYOND UNDERSTANDING ALSO THE SUBJECTS WOULD HAVE TO BE YOUNG ADULTS WHEN THEY ENTER THIS WORLD OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THE CONCEPT OF ANYTHING
WELL IF IT WAS LIKE THIS WHAT IS THE PROBLEM

IF SOMEONE WOULD USE HIS POWER TO CREATE US AND LET US LIVE OUR LIVES WITHIN THAT GAME WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WE CANNOT EXIT IT ANYHOW EVEN IF WE WOULD COMMIT SUICIDE THIS WOULD PROBABLY JUST BE SOMEONE QUITTING THE GAME REMOVING HIS HER USER ACCOUNT AND THATS IT WHAT WE KNOW AS OUR OWN WILL WOULD MOST CERTAINLY JUST BE AN IDEA SOMEONE HAS PLACED INSIDE OUR HEADS
JUST FYI WHAT MUSK REALLY SAID IS THAT HE THINKS THERE'S A ONE IN A BILLION CHANCE THAT WE'RE LIVING IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION SIDE NOTE WASN'T THE PERSON WHO ASKED THAT JOSH TOPOLSKY OF VERGE

DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THAT NETFLIX SHOW STRANGER THINGS DEALS WITH THIS SAME THEORY SCIENTISTS CREATE A PARALLEL UNIVERSE

IF THIS IS A SIMULATION WHAT REASON WOULD THERE BE FOR SOME OF THE MORE FRIVOLOUS PHYSICS THAT WE OBSERVE WHY HAVE THINGS LIKE DARK MATTER OR EXPANSION OF SPACE IT SEEMS UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED FOR INTELLIGENT DESIGN
REMOVED
REALLY SHITTY FOR PEOPLE THAT HAD BIRTH DEFECTS AND PAINFULLY CRIPPLING DISEASES I DON'T SE WHY ANY INTELLIGENT SENTIENT BEAM WOULD SIMULATE SUFFERING LIKE THAT
FOR INCLUDING BRUCE LEE IN A POST ABOUT PHILOSOPHY AND FOR THE UNINITIATED TRY THIS
THE FIRST POINT SIMPLY RELIES ON THE SUGGESTION THAT OMNIPOTENCE CAN'T EXIST BECAUSE IT INVOLVES A CONTRADICTION OF THE POWER TO LIMIT ONES OWN POWER SINCE THIS CAN'T HAPPEN THE QUESTION OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN OMNIPOTENCE AND OMNISCIENCE IS RENDERED POINTLESS SO WHY READ ON BEYOND THAT THERE ARE OF COURSE A FEW COMMENTS IMPLYING DAWKINS IS IGNORANT ABOUT PHILOSOPHY TOP NOTCH STUFF HE SAID WITHOUT A TRACE OF SARCASM RELYING INSTEAD ON THE CONTEXT TO IMPLY IT
INCIDENTALLY IT HAS NOT ESCAPED THE NOTICE OF LOGICIANS THAT OMNISCIENCE AND OMNIPOTENCE ARE MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE IF GOD IS OMNISCIENT HE MUST ALREADY KNOW HOW HE IS GOING TO INTERVENE TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY USING HIS OMNIPOTENCE BUT THAT MEANS HE CAN T CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT HIS INTERVENTION WHICH MEANS HE IS NOT OMNIPOTENT PP

WE HAVE HERE A STANDARD NEW ATHEIST RHETORICAL TRICK TAKE A SIMPLISTIC OBJECTION TO THEISM THAT HAS BEEN RAISED AND ANSWERED MANY TIMES AND PRESENT IT TO THE UNWARY READER AS IF IT WERE A DEVASTATING REFUTATION THAT NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO REBUT

PRESENT IT TO THE UNWARY READER AS IF IT WERE A DEVASTATING REFUTATION REALLY IT IS CLEAR BY DAWKINS OPENING INCIDENTALLY AND FROM THE SURROUNDING CONTEXT OF THAT QUOTE I JUST CHECKED THAT HE'S JUST MAKING AN INCIDENTAL POINT THAT'S A SIDELINE TO THE MAIN ISSUES HE'S ADDRESSING AT THE TIME

AND WHAT DAWKINS IS SAYING IS ENTIRELY REASONABLE ACTUAL OMNISCIENCE AND OMNIPOTENCE ARE MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE THEISTS ONLY GET AROUND THIS BY REDEFINING THE WORD OMNIPOTENCE TO MEAN SOMETHING THAT ISN'T ACTUALLY OMNIPOTENCE

WOW THERE ARE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS BAKED INTO THIS ARGUMENT GOD IS OMNIPOTENT BUT CAN'T DO CONTRADICTORY THINGS BUT IF HE COULD THAT WOULD PROVE THAT ANY ARGUMENT AGAINST HIS OMNIPOTENCE IS INVALID BECAUSE GOD CAN MAKE IT VALID

WAS THIS ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY OR IS IT A JOKE IT CAN BE HARD TO TELL SOMETIMES
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AT SOME POINT THEOLOGIANS REALISED THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARDS NOTION OF OMNIPOTENCE AND JUST DECIDED TO REDEFINE THE NOTION TO MAKE THE PROBLEM GO AWAY IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT DID NOT HAPPEN LIKE THIS

AND FOR THAT MATTER WHERE'S THE EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THIS STUFF WORKS THE WAY THEY CLAIM IT DOES AND IF THERE ISN'T ANY SUCH EVIDENCE WHY SHOULD ANY OF US TREAT SUCH VIEWS AS ANYTHING MORE THAN SOPHISTICATED WORD GAMES

SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO PAUL HENNE DUKE UNIVERSITY DESCRIBES THE FALLACY OF DIVISION THE INFORMAL FALLACY THAT ARISES WHEN WE ASSUME THAT THE PARTS OF SOME WHOLE MUST HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES AS THE WHOLE THEY MAKE UP HE ALSO DISCUSSES WHY WATER MOLECULES AREN'T WET

I LOVE THIS PHILOSOPHY JEREMY BENTHAM IS MY HERO
PETER HACKER HAS FLESHED THIS PICTURE OUT COMPLETELY WHETHER THE AUTHOR KNOWS IT OR NOT AND I ASSUME NOT BECAUSE NO MENTION OF HACKER IS MADE
THIS IS A GOOD ARTICLE BUT I ALWAYS FOUND IT RATHER OBVIOUS I DON'T THINK IT IS NECESSARILY A KILLER TO PHYSICALISM THOUGH I FIND IT A SIGN OF REMARKABLE ARROGANCE AND HUBRIS TO ASSERT THAT NO POSSIBLE DISCOVERY COULD GIVE US AN ACCOUNT OF CONSCIOUSNESS WITH CHALMERS ON THIS WHATEVER YOU'D CALL THAT
THIS IS DEFINITELY A GREAT ARTICLE THIS WITTGENSTEINIAN PERSPECTIVE DOESN'T SOLVE THE HARD PROBLEM DOES IT NEVERTHELESS I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE MUST GO IT'S SORT OF THE MIDDLE WAY IT SEEMS
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH THESE COURSES
SIGN UP SEARCH PHILOSOPHY AND ENJOY I AM CURRENTLY TAKING THE INTRO CLASS BY MIT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS ABOUT TO END YOU CAN STILL SIGN UP AND WATCH ALL LECTURE AND COMPLETE THE QUESTIONS BUT AFTER THE DEADLINE THEY WONT COUNT FOR A GRADE THERE ARE ALSO SELF PACED ONES FROM OTHER UNIVERSITIES THEY ARE ALL FREE
BUT THEY DO NOT COUNT TOWARDS COLLEGE CREDIT

SHELLEY DEATH LECTURES I REMEMBER WATCHING DURING HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASSES ON MY IPOD NANO AND IT WAS WAAAYYY MORE INTERESTING THAN THE BORING ASS INCORRECT STOICHIOMETRY I WAS TAUGHT THIS WAS MY FIRST REAL ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE WITH PHILOSOPHY AND IT GOT ME HOOKED IT EXPLORES SOME OF THE USUAL RESPONSES TO DEATH USING MEMORABLE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS AND HAS PUT SOME IDEAS IN MY HEAD THAT I STILL LIKE AND AGREE WITH INCLUDING

EVERYONE DIES ALONE IS EITHER UNTRUE OR UNINTERESTING
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO FEAR DEATH
SOME CLARITY ON THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM

WOULD RECOMMEND I'M ALSO A FAN OF THE LECTURE FORMAT YOU'LL SEE HERE THAT'S BEING REPLACED BY COURSER DDX AUDACITY STYLE BYTE SIZED INTERACTIVE VIDEOS DIRECTED AT A VIDEO AUDIENCE WITH NO ATTENTION SPANISH IT'S SAD TO ME THAT YALE AND OTHER UNIVERSITIES HAVE STOPPED SLOWED RECORDING AND RELEASING STUFF LIKE THIS
I'M EXCITED TO LEARN I CAN LISTEN TO SOME OF STRAUSS LECTURES THANK YOU FOR THIS
THANK YOU THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING FOR
ANY OF THESE GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT PHILOSOPHY CONSIDERS WITHOUT SAYING WHO SAID WHAT CHRONOLOGICALLY I JUST WANT THE CONTENT NOT THE PERSONALITIES OR THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT AT LEAST UNTIL I UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF IT ALL FIRST
I GOT EXCITED WHEN L READ IT AS A FREE ONLINE PHOTOGRAPHY COURSE BUT THEN HIT A WALL OFF IMMENSE DECEPTION WHEN L REALIZED MY MISTAKE
I HAD DOUBT WITH THIS ONE BUT IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS GOOD STUFF THANK YOU
EXCELLENT RESOURCES THANK YOU FOR SHARING
PHILOSOPHY COURSE HONESTLY WHAT CAN YOU LEARN
NOTED PEOPLE WITH VIEWS ON IT CLEVER WAYS TO DESCRIBE THE OBVIOUS AND A LIST OF IMPORTANT SOUNDING WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT
OR STUDY SOMETHING USEFUL
THIS IS NOT A PARADOX BUT IT SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THAT A RANGE OF RATIONAL BELIEFS MAY BE INTERNALLY INCONSISTENT IF EACH PROPOSITION OF MANY IS FORWARDED ON THE BASIS THAT THEY ARE LIKELY IT MAY STILL BE ENTIRELY UNLIKELY OR EVEN IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE SET OF PROPOSITIONS AS A WHOLE IS TRUE IF THIS SET OF PROPOSITIONS IS USED TO DEDUCE A NEW ONE THE ARGUMENT IS NOT ACTUALLY VALID DESPITE THE FACT THAT EACH STEP IS REASONABLE IN ISOLATION
EH DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A PARADOX TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE A ROUNDING ERROR IF YOU ASSUME AN UNLIKELY EVENT HAS A VERY LOW PROBABILITY AND YOU ROUND THAT PROBABILITY TO ZERO THEN OF COURSE A LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE LOW PROBABILITY EVENTS WILL STILL HAVE A PROBABILITY OF ZERO WHILE IN REALITY THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPEN IF YOU DON'T ROUND TO ZERO HOWEVER THE PROBABILITIES WOULD ADD UP JUST FINE
AS LONG AS SOMETHING AND SOMETHING MORE MAKE SENSE TO HUMANS WE WILL ALWAYS WONDER ABOUT THINGS SUCH AS INFINITY MATHEMATICIANS TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE KEEP EXTENDING NUMBERS A NORMAL PERSON MAY ASSOCIATE IT WITH THE EXPANSE OF THE UNIVERSE AND SO ON MANY EXPRESSIONS SAME UNDERLYING SEMANTIC CONCEPTION
DELETED
I DO NOT SEE IN THE TRUE ONLY MINUTE INTERVIEW NEITHER THE WHY OR THE HOW JUST THE IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS FUNDAMENTAL THEN PERHAPS HE CAN DERIVE SOMETHING MEANINGFUL WHICH WOULD BE INDICATIVE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS FUNDAMENTAL BUT THEN TOO MANY FACTS ARE THROWN OUT THERE

HE CAN DERIVE FROM HIS THEORY THE WAVE EQUATION OF THE FREE PARTICLE HOW CAN A MODEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS BEING FUNDAMENTAL LEAD TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEING DERIVED

2 THERE ARE QUANTUM PHYSICISTS WHO SAY THAT PROPERTIES LIKE SPACE EXIST ONLY IN THE ACT OF OBSERVATION

QUANTUM BAYESIAN PHYSICISTS CLAIM THAT THE ACT OF OBSERVATION CREATES THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES I THOUGHT THAT OBSERVATION AFFECTS THE BEHAVIOUR NOT THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES THEMSELVES

I AM DEPRESSED WITH MY LACK OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT DO I MISS

IN THE BIBLE PSALMS I LIKED HOW AGGRESSIVE THE OTHER GUY IS
IF YOU FIND THIS VIEWPOINT INTERESTING I'D RECOMMEND HAVING A LOOK AT THE WORK OF BERNARDO LASTRUP
HIS THEORY DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE UNIVERSALITY OF OUR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE REAL WORLD I EAST REALITY IMHO CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN EMERGENT PROCESS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL ONE
ANYONE KNOW WHO THE GUY ON THE LEFT IS
FOR CONSCIOUS TO EXIST AS FATHERING THE PHYSICAL WORLD OR AS HE PUT IT THE PHYSICAL WORLD WITHIN OUR PERCEPTIVE REALM WHAT STANDARDS COULD YOU BASE THE OBJECTIVE CERTAINTIES OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD ON IF PERCEPTION IS SAID TO BE AN ASPECT OF SUBJECTIVITY THAT WE SHARE WITH ONE ANOTHER
I READ THIS WHY AND HOW COUSCOUS IS FUNDAMENTAL AND I THOUGHT WELL COUSCOUS IS FUN AND YET MENTAL AT THE SAME TIME

THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME
I FEEL LIKE ONE OF HIS EARLIER STATEMENTS ISN'T TRUE BUT IT'S PRETTY WIDELY KNOWN NOT TO BE TRUE I ASSUME I'M MISINTERPRETING IT HE SAID SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU ASSUME WE LIVE IN A REALITY WITH SPATIAL DIMENSIONS AND TIME DIMENSION YOU'D HAVE TO ASCRIBE THE INTERPRETATION THAT ORGANISMS THAT SEE MORE DIMENSIONS ARE JUST VIEWING THE SAME PHYSICAL WORLD FROM A DIFFERENT LENS THIS WHOLE THING HAPPENS AT AROUND I FEEL AS THOUGH THAT STATEMENT IN ITSELF CONTRADICTS ITSELF

I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN I UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSED IDEA THIS JUST BEEN BUGGING ME CAUSE IT SEEMS WRONG
CAN ANYONE FILL ME IN ON WHAT THIS ANSWER WOULD BE IF YOU ASKED HIM ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE LIKE EARTH IS BILLION YEARS OLD AND LIFE ON EARTH GOES BACK BILLION YEARS WHAT EXISTED IN THE FIRST BILLION YEARS BEFORE LIFE

WHAT EXISTED RIGHT AFTER THE BIG BANG DID CONSCIOUSNESS EXIST BACK THEN TO FACILITATE THAT

GOING OUT DRINKING BBL


HE'S BEING AWFULLY DODGY ABOUT WHETHER AN OBJECTIVE REALITY EXISTS THAT WE ALL SHARE WHICH EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL SUBJECTIVE REALITIES ARE BASED ON HE TALKS ABOUT CONSCIOUS BEINGS BUILDING EXISTENCE OUT OF EXPERIENCE BUT EXPERIENCE OF WHAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE HE'S TAKING SHADOW ON THE WALL AND SAYING THAT SINCE EACH OF US CAN ONLY SEE OUR SHADOW OUR SHADOW IS OUR WORLD EVEN THOUGH THE FACT THAT IT'S A SHADOW IN THE FIRST PLACE IMPLIES FURTHER POSSIBLY PRACTICALLY IMPERCEPTIBLE IN ALL FAIRNESS EXISTENCE OUTSIDE OF THAT
HE MUST HAVE A GOOD DEFINITION FOR CONSCIOUSNESS ANYONE KNOW WHERE I COULD FIND IT

FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE BACKGROUND OF THIS CONVERSATION

QUANTUM BAYESIANISM IS AN INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS WHERE THE SCHROEDINGER WAVE IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A REAL PHYSICAL OBJECT WITH EXTENSION BUT IS INSTEAD A MERE EQUATION A CALCULATING DEVICE

UNDER QB WHAT THE SCHROEDINGER WAVE IS MEASURING IS AN LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF A SYSTEM'S STATE FROM A DISTANCE IN SPACETIME

IN THIS CONVERSATION HOFFMAN APPEARS TO SNEAK QUANTUM BAYESIANISM PAST RADAR IT'S AS IF HOFFMAN KNEW AHEAD OF TIME THAT KUHN HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT



THE REST OF MY REPLY WILL BE TO THOSE OF YOU HAVE SPENT LOTS OF TIME DISCUSSING DEBATING PEOPLE ABOUT INTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

QUANTUM BAYESIANISM DEFINITELY DOES NOT PRESUME THAT SPACE AND TIME ARE DERIVATIVES OF ANYTHING LET ALONE CONSCIOUSNESS WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE MODERN THEORIES OF PHYSICS WHICH DO PREDICT THAT TIME AND SPACE ARE DERIVATIVES ARE THINGS LIKE QUANTUM GRAVITY THEORIES EG SPIN FOAMS CAUSAL DYNAMICAL TRIANGULATIONS AND THE LIKE

QUANTUM BAYESIANISM INSTEAD ASSUMES A FIXED BACKGROUND WITH A TIME EVOLUTION OF THE HAMILTONIAN QB AT BEST REVEALS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE PERSISTENCE AND TRANSMISSION OF QUANTUM INFORMATION BETWEEN VARIOUS SYSTEMS BUT IT DEFINITELY DOES NOT COME WITH SOME SORT OF PROBABILISTIC WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE THAT OFTEN REDUCES TO SPACE AND TIME GIVEN THE MIND OF THE OBSERVER
I BELIEVE IT IS TOO BUT I'M NOT GOING AROUND TRYING TO MAKE A NAME FOR MYSELF AS THE GUY WHO SAYS ITS THE ONLY THING THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL

THE REINCARNATED EINSTEIN GUY IS RIGHT THAT YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE PHYSICAL FUNDAMENTALS ALONG SIDE A NEW ONE FOR CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT HAVING TO WIPE OUT EVERYTHING WE THINK WE KNOW

THE EGO COMEBACK THAT ELECTRONS WOULD NEED TO HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT NECESSARILY FOLLOW BUT EVEN IF IT DID SO WHAT

HOW MUCH CONCENTRATED CONSCIOUSNESS IS REQUIRED BEFORE WE RECOGNIZE IT AND WILL POINT TO IT AND SAY YOU ARE CONSCIOUS

MANY OF US DON'T ACCEPT THAT OTHER APES ARE CONSCIOUS LET ALONE DOGS CATS BIRDS LIZARDS BUGS MOLD BACTERIA VIRUS OR EVEN MINERALS

BUT HOW DO WE KNOW WHO ARE WE TO SAY

JUST BECAUSE WE ARE THE TOP CONSCIOUSNESS ON EARTH DOES NOT MEAN THAT WILL ALWAYS BE THE CASE IT MAY NOT EVEN BE THE CASE DURING OUR LIFETIMES
WELL HE DIDN'T REALLY SHOW EXPLAIN ANYTHING HERE JUST CLAIMS VERY COOL IF HE'S RIGHT THOUGH
YOU AND OTHERS HERE MAY BE INTERESTED IN THE RECENT SUBREDDIT R SCIPHILCONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS DEVOTED TO THE SHARING AND DISCUSSION OF CONTENT RELATED TO THE SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY OF CONSCIOUSNESS
FALLACIES IN THE VERY FIRST QUESTION OF THE INTERVIEWER

TIME DOES NOT EXIST ON ITS OWN IT'S MERELY A MEASURE OF STRUCTURAL CHANGE THERE IS NO PAST YOU CAN GO BACK TO OR NO FUTURE THAT EXISTS ANYWHERE ONLY NOW


2 SPACE AS IN DISTANCE IS A PROPERTY OF PHYSICS IT DOESN'T APPLY TO CONCIOUSNESS IN THE SAME WAY SEE EXAMPLE IN THIS VIDEO FOCUSSED ATTENTION BREAKS DOWN WAVE FUNCTION REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE
WATCH V NRSBAQ


IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE PHYSICAL WORLD DOESN'T EXIST IT JUST MEANS IT'S A PROPERTY OF CONCIOUSNESS
IT DOESN'T INVALIDATE THE PHYSICAL WORLD IT DOESN'T DISPROVE ANY SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS CONCIOUSNESS HASN'T BEEN OBSERVED AS A BRAIN GENERATED PROCESS

BERNARDO LASTRUP HAS THE BEST UNDERSTAND OF THIS READ HIS BOOKS IF YOU ARE INTERESTED
HOW IS THIS ANY DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY RUN-OF-THE-MILL IDEALISM BERKELEY ETC
THIS IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF THE DETRIMENTS OF NOT KNOWING THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY THIS SAME PROBLEM WAS BEEN AROUND FOR AGES IT'S CALLED IDEALISM AND ITS VARIOUS WEAKNESSES HAS BEEN ARTICULATED MANY MANY TIMES OVER THIS IS JUST A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO HAS TANGLED HIMSELF UP IN LANGUAGE AND CONFUSED A PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM FOR AN EMPIRICAL ONE
I'M NOT SURE IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO REALITY WHATEVER IT MAY BE BUT OUR BIOLOGICAL APPARATUS IS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL TO THE EQUATION IN WHICH WE ARE A PART OF

WE CANNOT REMOVE OURSELVES FROM THE EQUATION ANY MORE THAN WE CAN OCCUPY SPACE AND BE ALIVE AND SELF AWARE WITHOUT THIS MEATSUIT THAT IS AFFIXED TO OUR BEING

WHAT I TAKE FROM THIS IS THE SAME THING I ALWAYS HAVE THERE IS NO VISION OF THE WORLD THROUGH THE HUMAN LENS THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF THE BIOMASS BEHIND IT
WHO ARE THE SPEAKERS
OBVIOUSLY THE WORLD WE PERCEIVE IS JUST A MODEL OF REALITY CREATED BY OUR PERCEPTIONS AND CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IT IS A VERY COMPLEX MODEL WITH A VAST ARRAY OF EXPERIENCES AND EXTERNAL FACTORS WE HAVE TO REACT TO SURELY IF OUR PERCEPTIONS VARIED FROM REALITY VERY MUCH THE VARIETY OF FACTORS WE HAVE TO COPE WITH WOULD DISTORT THAT MODEL UNTIL IT WAS NO LONGER USEFUL WE CREATE AUTONOMOUS MACHINES AND COMPUTERS WHICH OPERATE WITH THEIR OWN MODELS OF REALITY AND THEY WORK WELL WOULD THIS BE POSSIBLE IF OUR OWN PERCEPTIONS VARIED VERY MUCH FROM REALITY IT ALL BECOMES VERY CIRCULAR AND NOT VERY USEFUL WE ONLY HAVE THE EXISTENCE WE PERCEIVE AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE IS VERY FAR FROM COMPLETE TO ASSERT THAT ACTUAL REALITY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM PERCEIVED REALITY WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE REALITY WE PERCEIVE
I THINK IF PEOPLE PICKED UP ON THIS PARADIGM WE COULD MAKE THE WORLD A MUCH BETTER PLACE THE OTHER PERSPECTIVE MAKES YOU A VICTIM OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT

EDIT
IT REALLY KIND OF FRUSTRATES ME THAT WE TEND TO ASSUME CONSCIOUSNESS IS A PRODUCT OF MATTER WHAT MAKES EITHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT MORE LIKELY

AURTHUR EDIT THE POTENTIAL OF A FULLY AWARE CONSCIOUSNESS IS INFINITE IT WOULD QUITE LITERALLY MAKE US GODS
CONCIOUSNESS PHYSICS CHEMISTRY BIOLOGY PHYSCHOLOGY

CONCIOUSNESS IS SINGULAR
I THINK THE QUESTION YOU ARE RAISING CAN BE FUNDAMENTALLY RECONSTRUCTED DOWN TO A VICIOUS CYCLE OF ASKING AND ANSWERING WE FIRST ASK HOW CAN WE PONDER THE NATURE OF SOMETHING BEYOND US AND WE ANSWER BY STATING THAT WE CONCEIVE IT AS A CONCEPT WHICH THEN RE RAISES THE QUESTION HOW CAN THIS CONCEPT BE FORMED IF IT IS BEYOND US WELL TO ACTUALLY ANSWER WE HAVE TO CUT THE LOOP AND FIRST ASK CAN CONCEPTS BE FORMED WITHOUT EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE WELL EPISTEMOLOGY WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT THIS VERY PROCESS IS IN FACT NOT POSSIBLE THUS IF WE ARE TO FOLLOW EPISTEMOLOGY WHICH IS THE BELIEF WE HAVE ESTABLISHED LEADS TO VALID ANSWERS THEN THE CONCEPT WE HAVE FORMED IS MERELY A CONCEPT AND IS IN FACT NOT SOMETHING KNOWN ABOUT OUR TRANSCENDENTAL QUESTION IN ESSENCE DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE MIND BODY PROBLEM THAT BEING THAT IT IS CLOSED TO US IS AN ABSTRACT CONCEPT THAT HAS BEEN FORMED WITHOUT EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND SO IS IN FACT NOT SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THUS RENDERING IT CLOSED TO US AS MCGINN SAID NOW I DON'T KNOW IF I FULLY AGREE WITH WHAT I JUST STATED BUT IT IS AN ARGUMENT THAT CAN BE MADE I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR OPINION ON THIS STANCE ON THE MATTER
SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRANSCENDENTAL OR ANYTHING ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY COGNITIVELY CLOSED IS ALREADY KNOWING SOMETHING IN A SENSE IN WHICH WE JUST SAID WE CANNOT KNOW

NOT REALLY NO NEW INFORMATION IS PRESENTED ABOUT IT DESCRIBING THE MIND AS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE MIND DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE MIND AS MUCH AS IT PROVIDES SOME DESCRIPTION ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WHICH IS OF COURSE A PROPERTY OF HAVING A MIND BUT WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW MIND WORKS WHILE HAVING ONE THIS JUST PRESENTS THE PROBLEM WITH ARGUMENTATIVE APPROACH TO PSYCHOLOGY YOU COULD MAKE THE SAME ARGUMENTS ABOUT DEHYDRATED GARLIC POWDER IN SOME SENSE WE MIGHT THINK THAT WE ARE COGNITIVELY CLOSED TO DEHYDRATED GARLIC POWDER IN INTERPRETATION WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS CHEMICALLY WHAT HAPPENS TO ITS CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OVER TIME BUT NOT HOW THAT MAKES IT TASTE HOW IT DOES SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT SEEMS PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF THE SUBSTANCE JUST CAUSES THE TASTE OF DEHYDRATED GARLIC POWDER SIMILARLY THE PERCEPTION OF PAIN FEELS HOW IT DOES BECAUSE OF ITS NEURAL ACTIVATION IN THE BRAIN CAUSED BY WHATEVER CELLULAR REACTION OCCURS TO SEND THE SIGNAL BY DESCRIBING IT AS SOMETHING FOR WHICH SOME INFORMATION ABOUT IT IS LOST IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE INFORMATION IS LOST BUT IT'S JUST BECAUSE OF HOW HE IS DESCRIBING IT THAT WAY AND PREDICATING HIS ARGUMENTS ON IT IF INSTEAD HE DESCRIBED THE TASTE OF DEHYDRATED GARLIC POWDER OR THE FEELING OF PAIN AS THE NEURAL ACTIVATION PATTERNS UNDERLYING THOSE PERCEPTUAL EXPERIENCES THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY CONFUSION
YOU'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF PRESENTING RAND IN THE BEST POSSIBLE LIGHT WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE WITH SOME OF THE IMPORTANT CRITICISM BROUGHT TO HER SUCH AS HER SHOCKINGLY POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS SHE CLAIMS TO BE REJECTING HER CLAIM THAT SHE IS THE FIRST TO DEFEND A MORALITY OF RATIONAL SELF-INTEREST HER VIEW THAT ALL OTHER PHILOSOPHERS HAVE DEFENDED EITHER ALTRUISM OR MYSTICISM AND HER UTTERLY TOXIC EQUATION OF ALTRUISM WITH ABJECT NAME BUT A FEW

PS WE HAD AN INCREDIBLE TIME DOING OUR AMA ON MONDAY THANKS FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE R PHILOSOPHY

EDIT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT ORGANIC FOODS MAY NOT IN FACT BE BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT TO BE CLEAR WE HAVEN'T ENDORSED A VIEW ON ORGANIC FOODS NOR DO WE INTEND TO THE DISCUSSION OF ORGANIC FOODS IS PRECEDED BY SUPPOSE YOUR FRIEND TELLS YOU THAT THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS UP
THIS IS A BIT BUT

THE CLAIM ORGANIC FOOD IS BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IS A SCIENTIFIC NOT CULTURAL ASSERTION IT'S ALSO CONTRARY TO THE MAJORITY OF RESEARCH DONE IN AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES ORGANIC FARMING USES MORE HECTARES PER FOOD PRODUCTION AND HAS MORE HIGHLY TOXIC PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES

MORE IMPORTANTLY THE CLAIM ISN'T AN UNCONTROVERSIAL INTUITION THAT MOST PEOPLE HOLD USUALLY IN EXAMPLES LIKE THIS USED AS AN ANALOGY TO CONVEY A CONCEPT YOU SHOULD USE AN EXAMPLE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WITH

IT STILL ILLUSTRATES THE CONCEPT BUT EVEN THE PART WHERE THE VIDEO SAYS THE CLAIM IS TRUE THEN IS DISTRACTING
ONE OF MAIN FALLACIES OF EQUIVOCATION PEOPLE MAKE IS WHEN ACCUSING OTHERS OF THE FALLACY OF AUTHORITY WHERE THEY EQUIVOCATE THE MEANING OF AUTHORITY AS STATUS THE POPE SAID AMOS ARE BAD WITH THE MEANING OF AUTHORITY AS EXPERTISE BIOLOGISTS SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AMOS CAUSE ANY HARM SAYING THE LATTER IS A FALLACY OF AUTHORITY IS INVALID
ORGANIC FOODS AREN'T NECESSARILY BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
REMOVED
NEED A PHILOSOPHER I HAVE A HONEST QUESTION HERE THE INTEREST POINT COMES UP A LOT WHEN I'M DEBATING WITH MY FRIENDS ABOUT JOURNALISM AND INFORMATION IN GENERAL IT USUALLY EVOLVES INTO WHAT IF ONE CONSIDERS AN ACTIVITY HE SHE ENJOYS DOING AS ITS BEST INTEREST REFERRING TO BENEFIT

DOES THIS HAVE AN ANSWER
I FEEL LIKE OF SOCRATIC ARGUMENTS CONSIST OF FALLACIES OF THIS SORT OR AS WITTGENSTEIN LIKED TO CALL THEM WORD GAMES
DO YOU EXPLAIN OTHER COMMON FALLACIES
THOUGHT THIS WAS A PICTURE FOR THE LONGEST TIME
WHAT DID HE ACTUALLY SAY THAT DIDN'T BOIL DOWN TO TIME IS AN INVENTION BY THE HUMAN MIND THE HUMAN MIND ISN'T REALLY REAL THEREFORE NOTHING IS REALLY IN TIME

THE MAIN THINKER WHO REALLY WROTE OUT THE IDEA THAT LANGUAGE AND WRITING IS THE SOURCE OF THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN SPACE TIME AND THE SENSUOUS REALITY IS DAVID ABRAM IN HIS BOOK THE SPELL OF THE SENSUOUS WHICH BY THE WAY IS A FANTASTIC BOOK THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD READ IT IS SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE IF ANYBODY KNOWS A MORE RECENT EXAMPLE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

THE GUY WHO MADE THE VIDEO IS OBVIOUSLY VERY CONFUSED AND COULD HAVE TAKEN SO MANY EXAMPLES FROM THE BOOK IN WHICH A LOT OF CLARITY CAN BE FOUNDATION RIGHT NOW THIS PERSON IS TALKING ABOUT THE WESTERN EXPERIENCE OF TIME WHICH IS A COMPLETELY ARBITRARY VIEWPOINT THERE ARE MANY INDIGENOUS CULTURES WHO DO NOT HAVE WORDS OR EVEN CONCEPTS FOR THE FUTURE AND PAST AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT THINK IN WESTERN LINEAR TIME YOU NEED TO DISSEMINATE WHAT LANGUAGE AND WRITING HAS DONE TO OUR PERCEPTION OF TIME YOU CAN'T JUST CASUALLY MENTION IT WE HAVE CREATED TIME NO IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE WHO IS WE AND WHY DOES THAT EXCLUDE CERTAIN CULTURES OUR MIND IS TIME I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THAT

I MEAN THERE ARE SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS SAID ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SPACE AND TIME EINSTEIN MADE SPACE AND TIME THE SAME THING AND WHITEHEAD AS WELL BOTH BASICALLY ADDRESSING THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME BOTH ADDRESSING REALITY AS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROCESS AND OBSERVER HOW INTERESTING IS THAT INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO THE MIND AS EPIPHENOMENON

EPIPHENOMENALISM IN THE THEORY OF MIND IS DEAD AND HAS BEEN DEAD FOR YEARS AT LEAST FOR AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDER FIRE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY STRONG OBJECTIONS RAISED IN THE RECENT YEARS FOR ME AT THE VERY LEAST IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT EPIPHENOMENALISM IS NOT A GIVEN I MIGHT BE ALONE IN THIS BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I DISLIKE THESE KIND OF VIDEOS WHO PRETEND THEY ARE SAYING PROFOUND THINGS WHILE ACTUALLY STAYING FIRMLY ROOTED IN SAFE SCIENTISM
OUR MINDS ARE PURELY A FUNCTION OF TIME

WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN

THE MIND EMERGED YEARS AGO

SO ONLY HUMANS HAVE MINDS

THIS GUY SOUNDS LIKE DEEPAK CHOPRA


TIME IS DEFINITELY A CATEGORY OF THE MIND AND NOT A REALLY EXISTING THING

I THINK TO READ FURTHER OF THIS TOPIC LOOK FOR THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE ABOUT TIME THERE IS AN ETHNOLOGICAL VIEW OF TIME AS WE KNOW AND USE IT TODAY AS JUST A WESTERN MAN MADE PRODUCT

WE HUMANS HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS HAPPENING ONE ANOTHER THAT'S FELT TIME THEN WE HAVE SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT TIME YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS WE READ OF CLOCKS THERE IS DEFINITELY A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN BOTH OF THESE TIMES I THINK THAT'S WHY ITS SOME KIND OF PROBLEMATIC TOPIC

ABOUT THE VIDEO HE HAS ONE OR TWO MILDLY INTERESTING POINTS BUT HE DOESN'T SHOW ALL IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVES OF TIME AND WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT IT ITS LIKE HE ONLY DESCRIBES THE PHYSICISTS VIEW ON TIME EXISTING BACK THEN WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS BORN DON'T GET ME WRONG ITS NOT I DON'T LIKE PHYSICIANS BUT SOMETIMES THEY ARE LIKE MATHEMATICIANS THINKING THERE TOPIC IS SO DAMN IMPORTANT FOR THE UNIVERSE EXPLAINING IT PERFECTLY I DON'T THINK ITS THAT POSSIBLE BUT THAT'S MY OPINION


THOUGHT IT HAD AN ILLUMINATI TRIANGLE IN THE MIDDLE WAS JUST A PLAY TRIANGLE
PHILOSOPHY BEGAN AS AN INDEPENDENT PROCESS IT CAN FEEL MORE BROADENED WHEN YOU ALONE CAN BEICE THINGS TOGETHER IT RESONATES IN COMMON SENSE YOU FEEL THE SENSE OF YOUR REVELATIONS
THE ARTICLE DOESN'T EXPLAIN IN ANY WAY HOW THEORIES WERE INVALIDATED BY SCIENCE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO LEARN THE SPECIFICS
GOETHE WAS A GENIUS

INTERESTING TALK AT JOHN VERVAEKE IS QUOTING SOMEONE AND I ENGLISH SPEAKER CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NAME IS

I DISAGREE WITH JOHN STATEMENT THAT RELATIONSHIPS AREN'T REAL IN THE SENSE OF PART OF REALITY

I GRANT HIM HIS POINT IF HE SAID THAT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ANY PHYSICAL ENTITIES ARE NON EXISTENT IF THERE IS NO CONSCIOUSNESS TO OBSERVE THEM BUT HOWEVER THERE IS CONSCIOUSNESS THEREFORE ANY CONNECTION MADE BETWEEN ANY PHYSICAL OBJECTS OR BEINGS WHICH CAN ONLY BE DONE BY ANYTHING WITH CONSCIOUSNESS PROVOKES A CHANGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IF ONE PRESUPPOSES THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A PHYSICAL PHENOMENON THEN THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE CONSCIOUSNESS IS BY CHANGING PHYSICAL REALITY

FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SEE SOMEONE YOU LOVE WHICH IS TO SAY YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND THIS OTHER PERSON THIS MATERIALIZES AS A CHANGE OF NEURON SIGNALS WHICH CAUSE A CHANGE OF HORMONES OR NEUROTRANSMITTERS AND ALL PHYSICAL CHANGES THAT COME WITH BEING IN LOVE HENCE I WOULD ARGUE REALITY HAS BEEN ALTERED BY A CHANGE IN THE SHAPE OF YOUR FABRICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS PERSON OBJECT

IS THE TIDE FINALLY TURNING I AM SO SICK OF THE NIHILISM MEME THE FACT THAT THIS GOT SO MANY UPVOTES SEEM TO INDICATE SOMETHING I HOPE THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THEM FOUND THE TIME TO WATCH THIS
AMAZING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UPVOTES ON THE POST AND THE AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF DISCUSSION EVERYONE WANTS TO SAY THUMBS-UP YES IT SOUNDS SUPER INTERESTING NO ONE ACTUALLY HAS ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT

HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BOOKMARKER THIS AND PLAN TO WATCH IT SOME TIME
I LOVED THIS VIDEO WITHOUT QUESTION I FEEL ENLIGHTENED THOUGH MUCH OF IT I REALLY HAD TO STUDY AND WORK TO INTERPRET I FOUND SOME AMAZING NUGGETS

AT THE JORDAN PETERSON RESPONDS TO THE NOTION OF LEVELS OF ANALYSIS AND IN DOING SO REALLY HIT ME HARD I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A DEEP COGNITIVE THINKER TAKING STEPS BACK AND ANALYZING IN DOING SO I HAVE OFTEN ENDED UP DOING THE VERY THING THEY URGED NOT TO WHICH IS LANDING ON THE NOTION OF WELL I'M DEAD IN A FEW COSMIC SECONDS ANYWAY SO WTF DOES ANYTHING MATTER

PETERSON CONSIDERS THAT STANCE ON LIFE PHILOSOPHY TO BE DUMB TO SAY THE LEAST AS HE MAKES IT KNOWN BY USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE SUN ENGULFING THE EARTH IN A MATTER OF BILLIONS OF YEARS MY LINE OF THOUGHT LEADS TO MY OWN DEATH SO I'M NOT EVEN MATCHING THE LEVEL OF ANALYSIS THAT HE IS BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S THE SAME IDEA WE'RE ALL DOOMED WHY BOTHER

THIS HAS SAT AT THE HEART OF MY DEPRESSION FOR A LONG TIME I OFTEN WISH TO BE A SHALLOW THINKER TO SPARE MYSELF FROM THESE TYPES OF THOUGHTS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY BOMBARDING ME THE MOMENT I MAKE IT TO A HAPPY PLACE A TRIGGER IS PULLED AND A STEADY STREAM OF DEPRESSIVE IDEAS BEGINS TO MAKE ITS WAY DOWN MY MIND STRIPPING ME OF THAT INITIAL HAPPINESS MOST OF IT STEMS FROM FEAR OF DEATH AND HONESTLY EVEN MORE SO THE FEAR OF FINDING OUT I'M GOING TO DO VERY SOON WHICH I FIND TO BE WORSE

TO SORT OF NUMB THAT PAIN AGAIN I MAKE MY WAY TO WTF CARE IF I'M DOOMED ANYWAY IN ESSENCE I SORT OF CONVINCE MYSELF FOR A SHORT TIME THAT NOTHING MATTERS AND THERE'S NO REASON TO FEAR AN INEVITABLE EVENT BECAUSE NOTHING CAN STOP IT FROM HAPPENING

BACK TO PETERSON HE PLACED RELEVANCE AT MY FEET WITH HIS RESPONSE TO LEVELS OF ANALYSIS HE PROPOSED THE IDEA OF TREADING THE LINE BY PLACING ONESELF THERE AND FOCUSING ON MAINTAINING ONES PRESENCE ON THAT LINE THAT LIES BETWEEN ORDER AND CHAOS THE EVIDENCE IS IN THE IDEA THAT WE WANT TO LIVE DESPITE SUFFERING THE INNATE DESIRE TO CONTINUE LIVING DESPITE THE FACT THAT LIFE IS A SLOW SUFFERING DEATH STEMS ULTIMATELY FROM OUR CURIOSITIES HE URGED US TO FIND THE LEVEL OF ANALYSIS THAT PLACES US ON THAT LINE AND TO MAINTAIN IT THIS IDEA WAS CONVEYED SO VIVIDLY AND APPLICABLY TO MY SITUATION IT'S A LIBERATING SENSATION TO KNOW THERE'S A PLACE I CAN FIND PEACE IF I CAN TRAIN MY MIND TO TRUST IN THOSE WORDS AND PUT THEM INTO ACTION AND TO NOTICE QUALITY HAPPENINGS IN LIFE

THE COSMOS ARE ABOVE US AND MORE THAN LIKELY THEY ALWAYS WILL BE AS WILL DEATH IT SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLE IDEA TO FOCUS IN ON THE MOST FRUITFUL LEVEL OF ANALYSIS BUT UNTIL THAT IDEA IS ARTICULATED TO PEOPLE IN MY SITUATION OUR MINDS RUN RAMPANT IT'S A CONSTANT BATTLE FOR ME TO KEEP MY MIND TRAINED ON THE THINGS THAT MAKE ME HAPPY AND WARD OFF THE INVASIVE THOUGHTS THAT TEAR MY HAPPINESS DOWN OUT OF NOTHING BUT FEAR BUT IT'S A BATTLE I'LL WAGE UNTIL MY TIME IS DONE THIS VIDEO PROVIDED ME WITH A NICE ARSENAL TO CONDUCT THAT BATTLE SO TO OP I SAY THANKS

HOPEFULLY AT LEAST ONE PERSON FINDS THIS WORTH READING HOPE YOU FOUND IT INTERESTING

I'VE HAD JOHN VERAEKE AS A PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO I TRIED TO BE IN ANY OF THE CLASSES HE TAUGHT BECAUSE HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW THAT LEFT STUDENTS SPEECHLESS AND EVERY LESSON ENDED IN APPLAUSE

EDIT NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE ARE OR ARGUING ABOUT THIS WHEN IT'S BASED OFF OF REAL EXPERIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY WHERE HE TEACHES I'M NOT SAYING WE ALL STOOD UP AND CHEERED BUT PEOPLE ENJOYED THE CLASS AND WOULD CLAP SMALL CLASSES OF PEOPLE NOT A BIG DEAL
IS A TRANSCRIPT OF THIS AVAILABLE SOMEWHERE
DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO DEDICATE TO THIS RIGHT NOW THANKS WORK BUT I WANT TO JUST THROW THIS QUESTION OUT THERE

THE GUY ON THE FAR RIGHT MENTIONS THAT WE ARE NOT CALCULATED LIKE COMPUTERS WHY IS IT HE THINKS THIS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED EVERY ACTION THAT HAS COME TO PASS HAS BEEN A CHAIN OF EVENTS STRETCHING TO THE VERY BEGINNING OF TIME THAT HAS BEEN VERY CALCULATED IN AN IF THAN SENSE

FREE WILL PLAYS INTO THIS AS WELL WE'RE SUPPOSEDLY GIVEN OPTIONS IN LIFE BUT IMO WHAT WE'RE REALLY GIVEN IS A BASTILLION YEARS OF PREVIOUS EVENTS FORMING US TO INTO A BALL OF CELLS RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW THAT IS PREDETERMINED TO COMMIT TO THE REST OF OUR LIVES IN A PATH THAT IS FORCED ON US BY THE ACTIONS OF EVERYTHING FROM EVERYWHERE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME

LOVE THIS TOPIC REALLY WISH I'D GONE TO COLLEGE IF FOR NO OTHER REASON TO DEBATE OTHERS
JORDAN PETERSON IS TRULY LIFE CHANGING AND IT'S INCREDIBLE PRIVILEGE TO LISTEN TO HIM HE INFLUENCED ME TO CONTINUE MY STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EVEN EXPAND THEM TO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
HEY THAT'S MY PROF
ANYBODY WILLING TO BLDR THIS FOR A FATHER WORKING 2 JOBS AND JUGGLING 2 KIDS
THAT WAS WONDERFUL THANKS FOR POSTING

DUALITY HAS BEEN SURROUNDING ME LATELY I WAS HURT RECENTLY ASKED WHY I THOUGHT WE ARE HERE MY ANSWER WAS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO FIGURE THAT OUT FOR OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL SELVES AND REALIZE NOW THAT I WAS BLIND TO THAT BEFORE I KNEW WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE
REMINDME HOURS
THIS IS AN AMAZING DISCUSSION THANK YOU FOR SHARING
WONDER HOW THIS WOULD BE IF TERENCE MCKENNA WERE ALSO PRESENT
WOW THIS SIMPLY BLEW ME AWAY I CAME HERE FROM R ALL AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS EXPECTING BUT IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS REGARDLESS IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE RIGOROUS USE OF COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY APPLIED TO NIHILISM AND THE MEANING CRISIS THAT AT AROUND WAS REALLY COOL TO WATCH I THINK THEY ENDED UP ESSENTIALLY IN AGREEMENT WITH ONE ANOTHER AT THE END

ONE THING I DID FIND WEIRD THOUGH IS THAT THEY SEEM TO DROP THE MORE STATIC SPINOZA WORLD-VIEW FOR NO REASON HALF-WAY THROUGH IN EXCHANGE FOR A DYNAMIC EDGE OF INTELLIGIBILITY MEANING SYSTEM THAT THEY END UP WITH IN THE END I GUESS THEY DECIDED THAT THE DYNAMIC ONE WAS BETTER I DON'T THINK THEY THREW ANY COUNTER ARGUMENTS AT SPINOZA THOUGH
I HATE THIS KIND OF TALK TO BE HONEST AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAVE GREAT COMMAND OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BUT OVERALL THEIR IDEAS ARE VERY SIMPLISTIC WHY NOT JUST USE PLAIN ENGLISH PRETTY WORDS MAY SOUND INTELLIGENT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE THEIR ARGUMENTS ANY MORE VALID

I OUT AFTER HE SAID THE CHAIR SPEAKS TO YOU TELLING YOU TO SIT
BEFORE I EVEN CLICKED ON THIS I KNEW IT'D BE JORDAN PETERSON A BOSS I'VE WATCHED EVERY YT VIDEO LECTURE IN THE PAST YEAR
THIS IS GREAT BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE HAVE A SENSE THAT THE ANSWER TO WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE SHOULD BE SUCCINCT OTHERWISE IT IS KIND OF NONSENSICAL BECAUSE YOU COULD LITERALLY TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED
I THINK I UNLOCKED SOMETHING THANKS
WITH REGARDS TO THEIR DISAGREEMENT ABOUT PERSPECTIVE THINK I HAVE A POSSIBLE RESOLUTION TO THEIR DISAGREEMENT I'D DISAGREE WITH VERAEKE THAT THE HIGH AND DETACHED PERSPECTIVE REMOVES BIAS AND DISTORTION AND INSTEAD SAY THAT BOTH PERSPECTIVES HAVE DIFFERENT FORMS OF DISTORTION

TO GIVE A METAPHOR THINK OF CAMERA LENSES IN A SENSE YOU CAN SAY THAT SOME LENSES ARE BETTER THE RESULTING IMAGE IS CLEANER AND CLEARER BECAUSE THE LENS IS MORE FINELY CRAFTED IN A SENSE THE RESULTING IMAGE MIGHT BE LESS DISTORTED HOWEVER IN EITHER CASE THE LIGHT IS GETTING BENT AND THE IMAGE ENDS UP FLIPPED UPSIDE DOWN LITERALLY THE PATH OF THE LIGHT IS DISTORTED

AND THEN BEYOND THAT THE MOST DISTORTION FREE LENSE MIGHT NOT RESULT IN THE BEST PHOTOGRAPH

I'M NOT SURE IF THAT METAPHOR MAKES MY VIEW CLEAR ENOUGH BUT I THINK THE HIGH OR ULTIMATE VIEW THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS DISTORTED IN FAVOR OF DETACHMENT IT IS EXACTLY THAT KIND OF DISTORTION THAT LEADS PEOPLE TO THINK THINGS ARE MEANINGLESS I THINK THIS CONNECTS WITH EARLY RESPONSES BEFORE THEY DIG INTO THE IDEA OF GAMES THAT THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ARE USEFUL FOR DIFFERENT THINGS

GETS ATTACHED IN THE DISCUSSION TO MAXIMIZING INTELLIGIBILITY BUT BASED ON OTHER THINGS HE SAYS I'D EXPECT HIM TO ADMIT THAT MAXIMIZING INTELLIGIBILITY IS OFTEN NOT GOING TO BE OUR GOAL AT A GIVEN MOMENT TO SOME EXTENT IT'S WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION THAT THE DETACHED POSITION TOWARD THE WORLD DESTROYS MEANING BUT IS ACTUALLY NOT MORE REAL THAN AN ATTACHED POSITION
TANGENT TOPIC

IS IT SOMEHOW MORE MEANINGFUL WHEN A PROFESSOR DISCUSSES THE MEANING AS OPPOSED TO SOMEHOW WHO ISN'T AS EDUCATED

THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC IS OPEN TO ANYONE HAVING THE EXPERIENCE OF LIVING I DON'T THINK ANY ONE PERSON CAN HAVE A MORE VALID CONJECTURE BASED ON THEIR LEVEL OF EDUCATION

I SEE THIS SORT OF THING OFTEN AND I THINK IT'S DANGEROUS IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH PERSON TO MAKE SENSE OF THEIR HUMAN CONDITION THIS SORT OF IDEA THAT ONLY INTELLECTUALS AND THE EDUCATIONALLY INDOCTRINATED BEING THE ONLY VALID SOURCE OF INFORMATION REGARDING THIS TOPIC WILL CASTRATE OUR SOCIETAL EVOLUTION

THINK FOR YOURSELVES AS FAR AND AS DEEP AS YOU CAN


DOES THE AUDIO QUALITY IMPROVE AT SOME POINT I AM HAVING SOME EXTREME DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT BEING SAID IN THE FIRST MIN OF THE VIDEO WHERE I STOPPED
TL R FOR US LAZY FOLKS ANYONE THE TITLE IS INTRIGUING BUT I DON'T HAVE 2 HOURS TO SPARE RIGHT NOW
RELEVANCE REALIZATION IS NOT THAT HARD HONESTLY IF YOU FORCE YOURSELF TO DO ANYTHING LONG ENOUGH AND DO IT WELL YOU START TO APPRECIATE ITS AESTHETIC VALUE LIKE I HATED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY WHEN I STARTED BUT BY THE END OF THE FIRST SEMESTER I KIND OF LIKED IT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND ONE'S PERSONALITY WILL PLAY A ROLE BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING I'VE FOUND THIS TO BE TRUE

THIS APPLIES TO SO MANY THINGS PERSONALLY I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WHO DON'T WORKOUT PETERSON USES GOING TO THE GYM AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW RELEVANCE REALIZATION IS DIFFICULT IN MY EXPERIENCE EVERYONE WHO GOES TO THE GYM AND SEES GOOD RESULTS GETS HOOKED IT'S ADDICTING SO ALL I CAN GATHER FROM WHAT HE SAID IS THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO GYM PROPERLY THE FACT THAT HE THINKS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PUSH YOURSELF TO YOUR LIMIT EACH WORKOUT IS ANOTHER INDICATION

WHAT I FIND HILARIOUS IS THAT IF HE DIDN'T OCCASIONALLY PROVIDE VOCAL AND PHYSICAL SIGNS OF AGREEMENT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE EVERY TIME VERVAEKE WAS SPEAKING PETERSON WAS MAKING AN EFFORT TO BE PATIENT WHILE HE WAITS FOR HIS NEXT CHANCE TO SAY ANOTHER THINGS

EXCELLENT VIDEO IF I KNEW IT WAS TWO HOURS LONG I MIGHT NOT HAVE WATCHED IT BUT AS TIME WENT ON IT JUST GOT MORE AND MORE INTERESTING AND INSIGHTFUL
ANYONE ELSE HAVE A LINK WHERE THE QUALITY OF AUDIO IS BEARABLE

THERE IS NO MEANING ARG
AWESOME TALK
SORRY THIS ISN'T AN ARGUMENT BUT CAN ANYONE POINT ME TO WHERE I COULD FIND MORE TALKS LIKE THIS THANKS
JORDAN PETERSON HAS SOME LECTURES ON THE INTERNET THAT ARE SUPERB DISPLAYS OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY HE HAS A GREAT LECTURE ON A JUNGIAN ANALYSIS OF THE LION KING HERE IT IS STUNNING ALL HIS LECTURES END IN WILD APPLAUSE
THAT WAS AWESOME
I DON'T LIKE HOW THE FIRST GUY CONFLATES MEANING WITH FUNCTION SAYING THAT SITTING IS THE MEANING OF CHAIRS BECAUSE YOU CAN REST YOUR ASS ON ONE IS TO ME LIKE SAYING VIOLENCE IS THE MEANING OF TREES BECAUSE YOU CAN SAW OFF A BRANCH AND BEAT SOMEONE TO DEATH WITH IT

GREAT TALK ALL THE SAME BUT I WAS SORT OF TURNED OFF EARLY ON BECAUSE OF THAT MY UNDERSTANDING OF MEANING IS VERY SPECIFIC
CLARIFICATION REQUEST CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHAT RELEVANCE REALIZATION IS I DO NOT THINK I FULLY GRASP THE CONCEPT
I'M KIND OF LATE BUT DON'T THESE TWO JUST TAKE SIDE OF CAMUS IN ANSWERING THE QUESTION

I LOVE PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE YOU ARE GETTING TO SOME ULTIMATE TRUTH OF REALITY BUT THE FACT IS PHILOSOPHY IS JUST A SHORTCOMING OF NEUROBIOLOGY YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO INVESTIGATE THE MEDIATORY PROCESS BETWEEN THE WORLD AND YOUR THOUGHTS NOW OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NEUROBIOLOGY IS VERY LIMITED AT THE MOMENT SO IN THE MEAN TIME A COMBINATION OF THE TWO IS MOST EFFICIENT

COMMENTING SO I CAN WATCH LATER
REMINDME HOURS
I REJECT THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THIS QUESTION IS BEING ASKED TO ASK WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE ASSUMES THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF COSMIC ETERNAL DEFINITION OF MEANING IT SEEMINGLY SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF COSMIC INTELLIGENCE AND THAT HUMANS OCCUPY SOME FORM OF PRIVILEGED POSITION IN THE UNIVERSE I REJECT THIS TYPE OF THINKING

OUR BRAINS WERE CREATED THROUGH EVOLUTION THEY ENABLE US TO FORM EXPECTATIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND ALLOW US TO INTERACT WITH A WORLD FILLED WITH OBJECTS AND PEOPLE WE DON'T THINK IN TERMS OF RAW SENSORY INPUTS WE THINK ABSTRACTLY IN TERMS OF SYMBOLS OBJECTS AND INTENTIONS I BELIEVE THE DESIRE FOR MEANING IS A SIDE EFFECT OF HAVING BRAINS THAT WORK IN THIS WAY

I DON'T THINK THEY ANSWERED THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE
THE ANSWER IS THE SAME FOR ALL LIVING ORGANISMS PERPETUATE THE SPECIES I KNOW IT IS QUITE BORING AND YOU CAN TRY TO FIND SOME METAPHYSICS ANSWER TO GIVE A SENSE TO YOUR LIFE BUT THE FACT REMAINS YOU ARE AN ORGANISM WITH THE SAME BORING GOAL AS ALL LIVING THINGS
THE MEANING OF LIFE IS A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM AND SET OF MICROPHONES FOR PROFESSORS DISCUSSING THE MEANING OF LIFE
AHH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HOW YOU CAN SEE THEM BOTH THINKING OF ALL THESE IDEAS AND DIFFERENT SPINS AND MEANINGS OF WHAT THE OTHER IS SAYING AND LITERALLY HOLDING THEMSELVES BACK TRYING NOT TO INTERRUPT THE OTHER EXCITED TO ADD MORE TO THE DISCUSSION
I DRAPE DIRTY CLOTHES ON MY CHAIR IS IT STILL A CHAIR
WHAT THE PROFESSOR MISSES IS THAT RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT ONLY REAL AND PART OF REALITY BUT TIED TO CONSCIOUSNESS CON SCIO TO KNOW WITH AND OUR ABILITY TO EVEN DISCUSS REALITY OUTSIDE OUR SELVES WALKER PERCY IN HIS REMARKABLE NONFICTION PHILOSOPHY BOOK LOST IN THE COSMOS DISCUSSES THE BIRTH OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AS A NATURAL RESULT OF LANGUAGE ACQUISITION NOT A CULTURAL ACQUISITION BUT A NATURAL ONE MAKING OUR USE OF SIGNS TOTALLY UNIQUE IN THE UNIVERSE OUR SHARING OF THE SIGN WITH A BABY OR TODDLER WHEN THEY LEARN WORDS OR A HELEN KELLER IN HIS EXAMPLE AND HER REALIZING HER TEACHER WAS SIGNING THE WORD WATER IN HER HAND IN THAT FAMOUS STORY THAT THAT IS WHEN REALITY OR HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS ARRIVES HOW CAN RELATIONSHIPS NOT BE PART OF REALITY WHEN THEY BEGIN IT IN A WAY WE ARE SIGN SHARERS AND WE NEED THE SHARED LANGUAGE TO EVEN ARRIVE AT THIS DISCUSSION OF WHAT MEANING IS WE NEED TO SHARE THE WORDS TOGETHER FIRST THE OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IS AT THE HEART OF REALITY NOT OUTSIDE IT

WE NOTICE THE OBJECT CAUSE OF DESIRE PURSUE IT ONLY TO EVENTUALLY REALISE THAT THE OBJET PETIT A HAS SHIFTED AGAIN THE GAP IN BETWEEN OUR TWO REALISATIONS IS WHERE OUR DESIRE IS MOST HEIGHTEN BECAUSE OF OUR IMAGINATIVE FACULTIES TO SATISFY DESIRE IS AN ENDEAVOUR IN FUTILITY
COMICS UNHAPPY
AH DESIRE THAT ELUSIVE APHRODITE SHE PROMISES MUCH DELIVERS OCCASIONALLY BUT IS NEVER KNOWN TO BE FAITHFUL FOR LONG

WE THINK THAT FULFILLING A DESIRE IS WHAT MAKES US HAPPY IN REALITY IT IS THE CESSATION OF DESIRE DUE TO ITS FULFILLMENT THAT MAKES US HAPPY

ABSTRACT

IN JERRY FODOR PUBLISHED A BOOK ENTITLED THE LANGUAGE OF THOUGHT WHICH IS APTLY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS IN PHILOSOPHY OF MIND AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE OF THE LAST YEARS OR SO THIS BOOK HELPED LAUNCH WHAT BECAME KNOWN AS THE CLASSICAL COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF THE MIND IN WHICH THINKING WAS THEORIZED AS THE MANIPULATION OF SYMBOLS ACCORDING TO RULES FODOR ARGUED THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF HUMAN THOUGHT REQUIRED THAT ANY COMPUTATIONAL COGNITIVE SYSTEM HAD TO HAVE A STRUCTURED FORMAT ANALOGOUS TO THE STRUCTURE THAT SENTENCES HAVE IN NATURAL LANGUAGES THAT IS ACCORDING TO FODOR WE MUST THINK IN A LANGUAGE OF THOUGHT SOMETIMES ALSO CALLED MENTALESE

CLASSICAL COMPUTATIONALISM HAS ALWAYS HAD ITS CRITICS MOST NOTABLY CONNECTIONISM OR MODELS WHICH INVOLVE A MORE COMPUTING SYSTEM CONSISTING JUST OF SIMPLE NODES AND THEIR CONNECTIONS WITHOUT ANY OBVIOUS INTERNAL STRUCTURE AT ALL BUT SINCE FODOR HAS ARGUED THAT THE COMPUTATIONAL MODEL COULDN T EXPLAIN KEY FEATURES AND KINDS OF REASONING LIKE MAKING PLANS FOR THE FUTURE OR MAKING DECISIONS QUICKLY AND HE HAS ALSO ARGUED AGAINST THE IDEA THAT NEUROSCIENCE HAD ANYTHING CRITICAL TO DO WITH UNDERSTANDING THE MIND IN SHORT FODOR HIMSELF HELPED UNDERMINE THE DOMINANCE OF THE CLASSICAL COMPUTATIONAL MODEL THAT HE PLAYED SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN FOUNDING

PROFESSOR SCHNEIDER ARGUES THAT LOT HAS SUFFERED BECAUSE IT WAS UNDERDEVELOPED IN CRITICAL WAYS IN THIS INTERVIEW SHE TALKS ABOUT HOW THE CLASSICAL COMPUTATIONAL MODEL CAN BE MODIFIED TO REMAIN A VITAL CONTENDER IN CONTEMPORARY COGNITIVE SCIENCE

THE SHEER VOLUME OF ASSUMPTIONS HERE IS ASTOUNDING
DOESN'T DEFINE FLOURISHING OR WHAT IT ENTAILS
2 MANY OF THE CAPACITIES LISTED IN THE ARTICLE ARE NOT COMMON TO ALL PERSONS NOR ARE ANY OF THEM STRICTLY SPEAKING NECESSARY FOR FLOURISHING
SAYS WE CAN BASICALLY JUST THROW IN CAPITALISM AS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT WITHOUT DEFENDING THAT IT NEED BE A CORE CAPACITY SOCIETY CAN FUNCTION WITHOUT CAPITALISM IT MAY BE BETTER FOR IT BUT IT IS NOT STRICTLY SPEAKING REQUIRED SIMILARLY CAPITALISM WILL ITSELF PERHAPS BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN A FEW CENTURIES AS THESE THINGS TEND TO DO
THE FUNDAMENTAL ERROR OR ATTEMPTING TO LEARN FROM SUCCESS REPLICATING SUCCESS DOESN'T ALWAYS LEAD TO SUCCESS UNLESS YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND FAILURE AND POTENTIAL POTHOLES THIS IS WHY BIOGRAPHIES ARE POOR TEMPLATES FOR SUCCESS JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING WORKED BEFORE DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL WORK AGAIN UNLESS YOU KNOW WHY IT WORKED AND WHY SIMILAR METHODS WILL FAIL
DIDN'T READ THE ARTICLE BUT RON PAUL SAID THAT THE FREE MARKET FORCES THE GOVERNMENT TO BE NICE
IF YOUR DEMOCRACY IS UNDERGOING A CRISIS OF LEGITIMACY WHILE OF THE POPULATION HAVE NO STATISTICALLY DETECTABLE INFLUENCE ON POLICY I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU'RE BLAMING DEMOCRACY FOR THE FLAWS OF OLIGARCHY AND TECHNOCRACY

I REMEMBER READING TOR NØRRETRANDERS MARK VERDEN WHERE HE TAKES A SERIOUS LOOK INTO THIS THING WE CALL CONSCIOUSNESS ONE CHAPTER IN PARTICULAR STRUCK MY ATTENTION IT WAS ABOUT OUR MINDS HALF A SECOND DELAY
OUR BRAIN IS ALWAYS MAKING A DECISION A HALF A SECOND BEFORE OUR CONSCIOUSNESS FOLLOWS ACTION WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION DO WE MAKE OUR OWN CHOICES
JULIAN JAYNES BOOK THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE BREAKDOWN OF THE BICAMERAL MIND IS MORE FAMOUS FOR IT'S CONTROVERSIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY OF BICAMERALISM BUT IN THE EARLY CHAPTERS HE DOES A GREAT JOB OF BREAKING DOWN THE LINE BETWEEN WHAT YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS DOES VERSUS WHAT THE REST OF YOUR MIND DOES

HE DOESN'T ANSWER THE PHYSIOLOGICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS BUT HE DID REALLY HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND MY MIND HE TEACHES THAT THE SCOPE OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS SMALLER MORE LIMITED THAN WHAT WE TEND TO IMAGINE WHILE IT THE CONSCIOUSNESS IS FOCUSING ITS HIGHER FACULTIES ON A PARTICULAR CONCEPT THE REST OF THE MIND IS CHUGGING AWAY HANDLING A HOST OF OTHER ISSUES ON AUTOPILOT OFTEN DOING A VERY FINE JOB HE GOES ON TO LIST MANY EXAMPLES SUCH AS DRIVING LEARNING TALKING ETC THAT WE CAN DO WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT OR EVEN HAVING SPECIFIC MEMORIES OF US DOING BECAUSE THE FLASHLIGHT OF OUR CONSCIOUS MIND WASN'T POINTED AT THAT EVENT

GREAT BOOK FULL OF TONS OF INTERESTING STUFF EVEN IF YOU DON'T BUY HIS PRIMARY THEORY
I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE UNIVERSE ITSELF IS INHERENTLY ABSTRACT AND PHENOMENAL IN NATURE MONISM WOULD TREAT AWARENESS AS THE EXITING FACTOR THAT BRINGS ABOUT EXISTENCE TIME SPACE COULD SIMPLY BE RELATED TO AWARENESS AND DESCRIBED AS THE CAUSATION TO FIELD EXCITATION IN PHYSICS SAY YOU HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY THAT PHENOMENALLY EXIST AS PARTICLES BY VIRTUE OF AWARENESS TIME WILL SLOW DOWN SPACE WILL CONTRACT AS IT IS ALL RELATIVES TO AWARENESS IF YOU READ THIS MESSAGE YOU ARE AWARE OF IT AND THE INFINITE SPACE BETWEEN YOU AND THE MESSAGE IS PHENOMENALLY VANQUISHED WHEN TWO FIELDS INTERACT AWARENESS PHENOMENALLY EXIST AND THEN THE PARTICLES EXIST IN THAT GIVEN MOMENT IN QUANTUM MECHANICS WE SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR AS LONG AS THE PARTICLES ARE AWARE OF ONE ANOTHER THEY CAN PHENOMENALLY AFFECT EACH OTHER THROUGH ANY DISTANCE AWARENESS AT A DISTANCE CONSCIOUSNESS IS A PHENOMENON CREATED BY THE BRAIN AWARENESS OF IT IS INTRINSICALLY THE DRIVING FACTOR BEHIND THE UNIVERSE

BLDR MONISM IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME ALSO YOU ARE GOD
DOESN'T THE NEUROSCIENCE OF CREATIVITY EXPLORE THIS VERY THING I FEEL LIKE THE ANSWER IS THERE HAVE TO PLUG THE RIGHT PHILOSOPHER IN WITH THE RIGHT RESEARCH NEUROLOGIST

HALF OUR BRAIN IS PREDICTING THE FUTURE THE OTHER HALF OF OUR BRAIN IS FOCUSED ON THE NOW A WEAK LINK BETWEEN THOSE TWO CAPABILITIES DRIVES NOISE WHICH EXPRESSES ITSELF IN DIVERGENT CREATIVE THOUGHT COULD THAT LINK BE CONCIOUSNESS

YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT TALKING WITH MY PSYCHIATRIST ABOUT THIS ACTUALLY I HAVE AID AND I DON'T REALLY FEEL ANY SENSE OF SELF SO TO SPEAK THEN AGAIN I DON'T REALLY FEEL MOST EMOTIONS LIKE OTHER PEOPLE DO THAT'S WHAT I'M TOLD ANYWAY AND A SENSE OF SELF IS NO EXCEPTION

TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE AID MIND IS RATHER DIFFICULT TRY AND IMAGINE YOURSELF AS A TINY LITTLE MAN INSIDE YOUR OWN SKULL CONTROLLING YOUR BODY WITH SWITCHES AND LEVERS THEN TRY AND IMAGINE A CINEMA SCREEN INSIDE YOUR HEAD PLAYING PAST MEMORIES EVERY POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND SITUATION THAT CAN ARISE FROM EVERY LITTLE CHOICE THAT YOU MAKE AND JUST A COUPLE VERSES FROM A SONG YOU HEARD PLAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN ALL IN EXCRUCIATINGLY VIVID DETAIL ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE EXACT SAME TIME BY THE WAY

THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF HAPPENING ALL AT ONCE FOR AID WE DON'T EVEN REALLY RECOGNIZE THE SELF
I'VE STRUGGLED WITH THIS EVER SINCE I TOOK MUSHROOMS AND EXPERIENCED TOTAL EGO DEATH
I TEND TO AGREE THAT OUR CONSCIOUSNESS OR THE REALITY THAT WE EXPERIENCE IS A RESULT OF THE EXPERIENCES WE'VE HAD PERCEPTIONS WE CARRY EMOTIONS WE HOLD I ALSO SIT SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THE CONTRASTING VIEWS I BELIEVE THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS A PHYSICAL PROCESS INFLUENCED BY THE INPUTS OF OUR WORLD BUT THAT IT ULTIMATELY MANIFESTS AS A SORT OF PERSONAL REALITY WHICH IS OURS ALONE THIS IS WHY PEOPLE LEAD DIFFERENT LIVES AND HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS IT'S ALL A MATTER OF WHAT MAKES UP AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONSCIOUSNESS
I LIKE THE QUOTE FROM HEGEL ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF SUBJECT AS HE CALLED IT SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR WRITES IT IS RATHER WELL KNOWN THAT THE FACT OF BEING A SUBJECT IS A UNIVERSAL FACT AND THAT THE CARTESIAN COGITO EXPRESSES BOTH THE MOST INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND THE MOST OBJECTIVE TRUTH FOR MAN BY AFFIRMING THAT THE SOURCE OF ALL VALUES RESIDES IN THE FREEDOM OF MAN WHO IN THE WORDS OF HEGEL HIMSELF HAVE TAKEN FOR THEIR POINT OF DEPARTURE THE PRINCIPLE ACCORDING TO WHICH THE ESSENCE OF RIGHT AND DUTY AND THE ESSENCE OF THE THINKING AND WILLING SUBJECT ARE ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL

PETER HACKER IS A FASCINATING SPEAKER
IT WOULD SEEM A MISLEADING TITLE AS THE CONTENT IS BASICALLY A REHASHING OF AN AGE-OLD WHY NOT AT ALL A WHAT NOBODY NEEDS TO BE TOLD PRECISELY WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE THEMSELVES BUT YOU WILL HAVE LIMITED BANDWIDTH AND CAPABILITY TO UNDERSTAND PRECISELY WHAT BEING ANOTHER IS LIKE

NOTHING WRONG WITH NOT KNOWING A THING AND KNOWING THAT YOU CANNOT KNOW IT BUT TO LABOR OVER THE SAME THINGS FOR MILLENNIA AND EXPECT TO FIND DIFFERENT ANSWERS
THE LAST BIT REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF EVERY STATS CLASS I'VE HAD TO TAKE CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION
THIS SUB IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TANGENTIAL ANECDOTES OR DANK MEMES EXPECT COMMENT THREADS THAT BREAK OUR RULES TO BE REMOVED

METHINKS ONE IS IS PERHAPS TOO CONTENT WITH THE UTILITARIAN MANUFACTURE OF REALITY
REMOVED
AUTHOR SHOULD KNOW BETTER GIVEN HIS BACKGROUND IN ECONOMICS VEGETARIANISM DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MEAT PRODUCTION JUST AS A PROBABILISTIC EFFECT

WHY LIMIT OURSELVES TO THE SUFFERING HUMANITY INFLICTS

ONE MAN'S MODUS POLLENS IS ANOTHER'S MODUS PONENT YES THE SUFFERING INFLICTED BY NATURE IS A BIG DEAL THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PAPERS ON THE ETHICS OF IT AND THE VALUE IN ALLEVIATING IT R WILDANIMALSUFFERING THE MAIN PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT PREDICTABLE WAYS TO ALTER ECOSYSTEMS SO FOR THE TIME BEING WILD ANIMAL SUFFERING IS MOSTLY A RESEARCH AVENUE BUT VEGETARIANISM AND VEGANISM ARE CONCRETE ACTIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE NOW

ON INTERESTS FEELINGS AND SPINES

I THINK THE AUTHOR IS JUST CONFLATING DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTEREST CLEARLY SINGER MEANS THE KIND OF INTEREST WHICH CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO PHENOMENOLOGY A PLANT WITH NO CONSCIOUSNESS HAS NO MORAL WEIGHT A HUMAN WHO IS DREAMING ABOUT BEING IN TERRIBLE PHYSICAL DANGER HAS NO OBJECTIVE INTEREST IN AVOIDING THE DREAMED DANGER BUT FOR HIS OWN SAKE IT'S BETTER THAT HE NOT HAVE SUCH NIGHTMARES THIS CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY APPEALING TO CONSCIOUS PHENOMENA AS MORALLY DIS VALUABLE
RELIGION ARTICLES
BASICALLY WHAT THIS IS TRYING TO SAY IN MY VIEW

MARY LEARNS ALL THERE IS TO LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD IN A BLACK AND WHITE ROOM

2 PHYSICALISM SAYS THAT ALL THERE IS TO KNOW IN THE WORLD IS PHYSICAL FACTS SIMPLIFIED EXPLANATION I GUESS

BUT IF MARY WALKS OUT THE BLACK AND WHITE ROOM SHE LEARNS WHAT IT IS TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING LIKE RED

THUS PHYSICALISM IS WRONG BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS NOT PHYSICAL THAT CAN BE KNOWN


I THINK THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS IS INSUFFICIENT FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF KNOWING THE THING AN EXTREME CASE WOULD KNOWING COMPLETELY THE STATE OF A COMPUTER IN TERMS OF BIT PATTERNS AND REGISTER CONTEXTS WOULD IN NO WAY REVEAL THE EXPERIENCE OF WATCHING THE SCREEN OF THE MACHINE WHICH HAPPENS TO BE SHOWING A PORNOGRAPHIC MOVIE AND THE REACTIONS OF VIEWERS WILL OFTEN BE VERY DIFFERENT AND OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THEM IMPOSSIBLE WHY BECAUSE TOM WATCHING THE PORNOGRAPHIC FILM DOES NOT KNOW ALL HIS BRAIN STATES MARY DOES MARY THEREFORE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR TOM TO WATCH THE FILM SHE KNOWS TOO MUCH
B I THINK THIS OBJECTION IS WHAT ADDRESSES THE MEAT OF THE ARGUMENT AND EXPOSES ITS BIGGEST PROBLEM THE WHOLE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS BUILT ON A HOPELESSLY NAIVE VIEW OF THE BRAIN AND KNOWLEDGE IN GENERAL

THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT LIKE MANY IN THIS PHILOSOPHICAL GENRE IS SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS SHOULD BE POSSIBLE IN THIS CASE MARY HAS TO BE RAISED FED AND TAUGHT WHERE SHE NEVER SEES ANY COLOUR BUT BLACK OR WHITE SO SHE CAN NEVER SEE HER SKIN FOOD OR THE PERSON TEACHING SHE IS KEPT IN CONFINEMENT AND THIS WOULD NOT MAKE HER IN ANYWAY A STABLE HUMAN BEING ONE MIGHT IMAGINE THEN SHE HAS SOME VR GLASSES FROM BIRTH WHICH RENDER HER ONLY ABLE TO SEE IN BLACK OR WHITE BUT AGAIN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS WOULD HARDLY PLACE HER IN THE POSITION OF BEING A RELIABLE JUDGE OF FACTS OK THEN WITH SUCH A VR DEVICE SHE MIGHT AS WELL BE LET OUT INTO THE BIG WORLD IN WHICH SHE WOULD BE COLOUR BLIND BUT WHY BOTHER THERE ARE ALREADY MANY COLOUR BLIND AND BLIND PEOPLE OUT THERE AS CANDIDATES SO WOULD YOU LET A BLIND OR COLOUR BLIND PERSON CHOOSE YOUR COLOUR SCHEME IN DECORATING OR WIRE UP CIRCUITRY COULD THEY KNOW THE RIGHT COLOURS I JUST THINK THESE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS A LITTLE SILLY AT BEST DANGEROUS AT WORST IT REDUCES HUMANITY TO ABSURDITY IN THOUGHT OR A NIGHTMARE IN PRACTICE ONE IS CONSCIOUS BEFORE KNOWING ANY FACTS AND BEING ABLE TO READ I AM THEREFORE I CAN THINK NOT I THINK THEREFORE I AM
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS AT LEAST HOW I'VE ALWAYS SEEN IT IS THAT IT'S TOO EASY TO REFUTE IT BY SAYING THAT EXPERIENCE OF RED CAN BE BOILED DOWN TO CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN HER BRAIN

THERE'S REALLY NOTHING METAPHYSICAL SUPERPHYSICAL ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE IMO

EDIT STUPID MIXUP OF OPPOSITE TERMS
THIS IS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE OF HOW GOOD MODERN PHILOSOPHY CAN BE IT IS WORTH COMPARING THIS PAPER TO MARTIN AND TO SEE HOW WELL MOTIVATED WORK IS COMPARED TO ESSENTIALLY THE SAME RESULT WITHOUT THE INTRODUCTION

THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO THIS APPROACH TO TRUTH ARE PARADOX WHICH IS NOT ADDRESSED BY THE GROUNDED NOTION OF TRUTH AND PARADOXES LIKE THE NO-NO PARADOX HERE WE HAVE TWO SENTENCES EACH OF WHICH DENY THE TRUTH OF THE OTHER

A NOT T B

B NOT T A

WE SHOULD GET A T A AND B T B BUT WE DON'T

THE OTHER MAJOR THEORY OF TRUTH FRIEDMAN SHEARD OR THE REVISION THEORY OF TRUTH DOES NOT DO ANY BETTER AND IS OMEGA INCONSISTENT INTERESTINGLY SEMANTIC THEORY OF TRUTH CAME BEFORE THE AXIOMATIZATIONS OF IT F ETC WHILE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE OF FRIEDMAN SHEARD
CONFUCIANISM CAN BE TAUGHT TO 5TH GRADERS I SHOULD KNOW I WAS TAUGHT CONFUCIANISM AS A 5TH GRADER AGE IT IS OF THE SAME CALIBER AS OTHER CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHIES LIKE THE PLATO AND SOCRATES GAUTAMA AND MAHAVIRA IT IS NOT NOT PHILOSOPHY RATHER IT IS JUST OLD AND SIMPLISTIC IT IS FOUNDATIONAL

TEACHING ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHIES IS LIKE TEACHING ARITHMETIC BEFORE YOU MOVE ON TO CALCULUS LINEAR ALGEBRA AND NUMBER THEORY NOT EVERYONE NEEDS TO LEARN THE LATTER BUT EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT FROM THE FORMER
PHILOSOPHY IS A LOVE OF WISDOM RATHER THAN THE POSSESSION OF WISDOM

IS IT THOUGH THIS SOUNDED VERY PRETTY THE FIRST TIME I READ IT BUT I'M HAVING SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT THE LENGTHS OF THE AUTHOR'S SKEPTICISM TAMPICO IS VERY QUICK TO CONTRAST LOVE OF WISDOM AND TRADITION BUT IT'S IN THIS VERY PARAGRAPH THAT HE MENTIONS THE BRITISH PHILOSOPHER ALFRED NORTH WHITEHEAD ONCE SAID THAT THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY IS A SERIES OF FOOTNOTES TO PLATO WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A TRADITION TO ME
THERE SEEM TO BE THREE DISTINCT QUESTION HERE

WHAT ARE WAYS WE CAN DRAW A BOUNDARY AROUND PHILOSOPHY AS A CATEGORY
2 WHAT SORTS OF WRITINGS SHOULD BUDDING PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS AND OTHER PEOPLE TAKING PHILOSOPHY CLASSES GET EXPOSED TO
WHAT SORT OF CURRICULA WILL BE MOST POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT FOR SECURING FUNDING FOR PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENTS

ALL TRADITIONS OF WISDOM AND TRADITIONS OF INQUIRY ABOUT THE WORLD AND TRADITIONS OF INQUIRY ABOUT THE WORLD THAT HEED NO MAN'S CONCERN FOR RELIGIOUS DOGMA AND TRADITIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT THE WORLD THAT HEED NO MAN'S DOGMA THAT DESCEND FROM PLATO ARE ALL PERFECTLY FINE CATEGORIES THAT YOU CAN SAY DISTINCTIVE THINGS ABOUT AND STIPULATE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE TERM PHILOSOPHY FOR BUT IT'S NOT OBVIOUS WHY WE SHOULD BE USING ONE OVER THE OTHER IF WE'RE NOT MAKING REFERENCE TO SOME PRACTICAL CONCERN LIKE OR 2 AND SEEMING EXCLUSION OF KALAM TRADITIONS OF DEBATE AND INQUIRY SEEMS TO RULE OUT TRADITIONAL FIGURES OF THE WESTERN CANON SUCH AS AUGUSTINE AND AQUINAS WHO SHOWED EVERY SIGN OF GUARDING THEIR ORTHODOXY EVEN AS THEY MADE LEGITIMATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ENTERPRISE AS WE CONCEIVE IT

SO SHOULD BUDDING PHILOSOPHERS BE REQUIRED TO BE EXPOSED TO DESCENDED TRADITIONS RELIGIOUSLY ORTHODOX TRADITIONS AND WHATEVER ELSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE CASE FOR BROAD CULTURAL INCLUSION DOESN'T NEED TO REST ON EITHER A CLAIM THAT CONFUCIUS OR ANY OTHER PARTICULAR AUTHOR IS PHILOSOPHY OR PERHAPS MORE USEFULLY THE SORT OF GOOD PHILOSOPHY WE WANT TO SEE PRODUCED GOING FORWARD THOUGH YOU MIGHT THINK IT IS AND DOESN'T NEED TO REST ON ANY SORT OF COMMITMENT TO INCLUSION OR MULTICULTURAL REPRESENTATION AS A MATTER OF JUSTICE THOUGH YOU MIGHT THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE ANYWAY RATHER EXPOSURE TO VERY DIFFERENT TRADITIONS THEIR WAYS OF THINKING THE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS THEY POSE AND THINGS THEY PRESUPPOSE IS AN AID TO PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT TAMPICO PRAISES THE WESTERN TRADITION FOR BOLDLY BEING WILLING TO SET ASIDE CULTURAL PREJUDICES IN THE SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH AND WITH ALL THE TRADITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS ONE COULD MAKE TO THAT I THINK HE IS RIGHT TO BUT MOST CULTURAL INHERITANCES AND ASSUMPTIONS CANNOT BE TOSSED ASIDE BY SIMPLY HAVING THE WILLINGNESS TO DO SO OFTEN THE PRINCIPAL BARRIER IS BEING ABLE TO NOTICE THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE BEING AWARE OF HOW PEOPLE IN MANY DIFFERENT CULTURES WITH ASSUMPTIONS DIFFERENT THAN OUR OWN HAVE THOUGHT SERIOUSLY ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF THINGS THERE ARE OR HOW WE SHOULD ACT IS A VALUABLE AID TO THINKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT THESE OURSELVES EVEN IF THE ANSWERS THEY PROVIDE OR THE WAY THEY GOT TO THEM DON'T FULLY PASS MUSTER BY OUR STANDARDS

OF COURSE TEACHING TIME IS LIMITED AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS TO BE EXPOSED TO THE ABOVE ARGUMENT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT A HIGHLY MULTICULTURAL CURRICULUM IS THE THING THAT SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED JUST THAT THERE IS AT LEAST A CLEAR CASE FOR CONSIDERING IT

WITH RESPECT TO THIS SEEMS TO BE HIGHLY CONTINGENT AND BEST BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF HOW PARTICULAR ACTORS CAN BEST BE APPEASED TAMPICO SEEMS TO MOSTLY JUST ASSERT THAT EXPANDING THE CURRICULUM WOULD MAKE PHILOSOPHY MORE POLITICALLY VULNERABLE BUT CLEARLY POINTS TO ONE SET OF PRESUMED POLITICAL ACTORS FOR WHOM THE OPPOSITE WOULD APPLY THOSE WHO DERIDE IT AS A PROVINCE OF DEAD WHITE MALES NO DOUBT THE FEMINIST THINKPIECE AUTHORS OF THE WORLD AND THE MARCO RUBIOS OF THE WORLD WOULD PREFER RATHER DIFFERENT THINGS PERHAPS WHAT THIS CONTINGENCY IMPLIES IS THAT INSOFAR AS PHILOSOPHERS ARE CRAFTING THEIR CURRICULA WITH AN EYE FOR PHILOSOPHY TEACHING SURVIVING DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENTS SHOULD RESPOND TO LOCAL DEMAND PERHAPS WHERE CULTURAL CONSERVATIVES ARE STRONG THEY CAN BE APPEASED WITH REFOCUSING ON THE CANON AND SOME INCREASE IN EMPHASIS ON MORE RELIGIOUSLY ORTHODOX PHILOSOPHY WHERE CULTURAL LIBERALS ARE STRONG THESE KINDS OF MULTICULTURAL PROPOSALS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND WHERE AS IS BASICALLY OVERWHELMINGLY THE CASE A VULGAR MATERIALIST EVALUATION OF THE HUMANITIES ECONOMIC VALUE PREVAILS THE PRACTICE OF DIALECTICAL DEBATE AND FORMAL ANALYSIS GREAT FOR FUTURE LAWYERS UNTIL THE LAW JOBS GET AUTOMATED I GUESS CAN BE DEPLOYED THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY A BETRAYAL OF PHILOSOPHY'S PURPOSE AFTER ALL THE CANON THE MULTICULTURAL EXPANSION OF THAT CANON AND SHARPENED DEBATE SKILLS ARE ALL GOOD THINGS FOR PHILOSOPHY BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP IN MIND THAT IT IS AN ANSWER TO A DIFFERENT QUESTION THAN OR 2
I DO THINK THAT ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY AND CONFUCIAN THINKING BELONG IN UNIVERSITIES BUT THE NATURAL PLACE FOR THEM IS IN THE THEOLOGY DEPARTMENT ALL THE MEDIEVAL AND LATER CHRISTIAN THINKING ON HOW TO LEAD A GOOD LIFE NOW BELONGS IN THE THEOLOGY SCHOOL NOT THE PHILOSOPHY SCHOOL THE KIND OF THINKING IN CONFUCIAN PHILOSOPHY AND ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY IS SIMILAR IN NATURE TO FOR EXAMPLE HUMANATE VITAE THE LETTER BY PAUL THE SIXTH ON BIRTH CONTROL

PHILOSOPHY IN UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENTS IS FAR FROM THIS STYLE OF REASONING ACADEMICS IN PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENTS DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THIS KIND OF THINKING SO THERE IS NO GOOD REASON FOR THEM TO BE IN THE SAME BUILDING ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY HAS CLOSE TIES IN STYLE OF WORK TO LINGUISTICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE THE ISSUE IS WHERE TO CLEAVE DEPARTMENTS SO THEY ARE NATURAL UNITS I THINK THAT THE NATURAL BREAK POINT IS BETWEEN RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHIES AND NON RELIGIOUS THINKING


GREAT ISLAMOPHOBIC PIECE LOL NOT SURPRISED IT GOT UPVOTES ON REDDIN
GREAT READ
FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF PART AND ALREADY I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING THE MAN IS A MASTERFUL LECTURER REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH YOU MIGHT DISAGREE WITH HIM THE DISTINCTION HE DRAWS BETWEEN EPISTEMIC SUBJECTIVITY EPISTEMIC OBJECTIVITY ONTOLOGICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND ONTOLOGICAL OBJECTIVITY IS THIS REALLY AS NEGLECTED IN PHILOSOPHY AS HE CLAIMS IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S TAUGHT TO UNDERGRADUATES
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE BOTH SPEAKERS MORE OR LESS AGREEING ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POINTS NAMELY THE HARD DISTINCTION BETWEEN SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS AND THE FAILINGS OF THE COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF CONSCIOUSNESS IT WAS FUNNY TO HEAR SEARLE MENTION THAT IT MADE HIM NERVOUS AS HE HIMSELF POINTED OUT IN THE EARLY WHEN THE CHINESE ROOM WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE EARLY COGNITIVE SCIENCE MILIEU HIS ACCOUNT WAS CONTROVERSIAL IN THE EXTREME WITH HUNDREDS OF REFUTATIONS PUBLISHED IN A SHORT PERIOD IN WATCHING THIS VIDEO AND IN SEEING RECENT WORK IN THE FIELD PARTICULARLY IN EMBEDDED COGNITION AND RECENT REEVALUATIONS INCLUDING FROM FODOR HIMSELF OF THE LANGUAGE OF THOUGHT HYPOTHESIS I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH THE INTELLECTUAL PENDULUM HAS SWUNG AWAY FROM COMPUTATIONALISM AND TOWARDS AS SEARLE PREFERS ESSENTIALLY NEUROBIOLOGICAL ACCOUNTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
TO TAKE THE CHINESE ROOM AS AN ARGUMENT THAT MACHINES CANNOT THINK BEGS THE QUESTION RATHER THAN ADDRESSING IT IT CONSTRUCTS A PARTICULAR VERSION OF A MACHINE THAT PURPORTS TO BE THINKING AND SAYS SURELY YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REAL UNDERSTANDING GOING ON HERE DO YOU THE BEST ANSWER IS WHY NOT

IF THE WORLD IS PURELY PHYSICAL THEN WHAT WE MEAN BY UNDERSTANDING IS A WAY OF TALKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR CORRELATION BETWEEN INFORMATION LOCATED IN ONCE SYSTEM AS INSTANTIATED IN SOME PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT OF MATTER AND CONDITIONS IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD NOTHING IN THE CHINESE ROOM EXAMPLE INDICATED THAT WE SHOULDN'T THINK THAT WAY UNLESS YOU ARE ALREADY CONVINCED WE DON'T

SEAN CARROLL THE BIG PICTURE





SEARLE IS SAYING THAT UNDERSTANDING CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT MAGICAL BUT IS SPECIFIC TO BIOLOGY AND CANNOT BE REPRODUCED IN SILICON ONLY SIMULATED I THINK THIS IS INCORRECT THE CHINESE ROOM ARGUMENT DOES NOT LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT NEURONS ARE NECESSARY ONLY THAT INFORMATION PROCESSING IS NOT SUFFICIENT

STEVEN NOVELLA AI AND THE CHINESE ROOM ARGUMENT
THIS IS AN INTERESTING ARTICLE AND WELL WORTH READING FOR ANYONE WHO READ THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS HERE OF ARGUMENTS

THAT SAID I THINK THE PAPER WHILE COMPLETELY CORRECT IN FINDING FLAWS IN HIS ARGUMENTS MISSES THE MAIN FLAW NAMELY EVOLUTION DOES GIVE US RELIABLE KNOWLEDGE ARGUMENTS FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT EVOLUTION COULD CREATE UNRELIABLE BELIEFS ARE VERY WEAK THE MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT WE COULD HAVE EVERYTHING BACKWARDS PAUL AVOIDS TIGERS EVEN THOUGH HE WANTS TO BE EATEN AS HE IS MISTAKEN IN WHAT ACTIONS LEAD TO WHAT OUTCOMES IS IT PLAUSIBLE THAT A PAUL COULD EVOLVE THAT DID NOT REALIZE THAT EATING REQUIRED BEING CLOSE TO HOW DOES PAUL FEED HIMSELF IF THE CLAIM IS THAT HE BELIEVES THAT ALL OTHER THINGS NEED TO BE CLOSE TO EAT SAVE FOR TIGERS THEN WHERE DID THIS EXCEPTION COME FROM

IF WE LOOK AT THE LARGER PICTURE AND DEMAND THAT BELIEFS BE COHERENT THEN IT IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO FIT WRONG BELIEFS TO THE WORLD BASICALLY WE HAVE A COMPLEXITY ARGUMENT THAT CLAIMS THE WORLD IS MORE EASILY HAS LOWER COMPLEXITY DESCRIBABLE BY CORRECT BELIEFS THAN BY INCORRECT ONES AS EACH INCORRECT BELIEF NEEDS FURTHER ELABORATION
WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH CHRISTIAN APOLOGISTS AND INSANE ATTEMPTS TO DISPROVE EVOLUTION
GREAT TO HEAR SOME COMMENTARY ON CLASSIC ARTICLE

MY PERSONAL OPINION DENNETT IS GIVING US ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT ON ONTOLOGICAL PRIMACY IS IT THE SCIENTIFIC OR MANIFEST IMAGE THAT HAS ONTOLOGICAL PRIMACY SURE ATOMS COME BEFORE COLOURS AND GOALS IN THE SCIENTIFIC HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE COLOURS AND GOALS ARE THEREFORE CAUSALLY DEPENDENT ON ATOMS

HOWEVER IF ONE CONSIDERS THE HISTORY OF KNOWLEDGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MY KNOWLEDGE FROM BIRTH TO ADULTHOOD OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITY'S KNOWLEDGE FROM LUCY TO DANIEL DENNETT COLOURS AND GOALS COME FIRST AND WITHOUT COMPREHENDING THOSE THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING OF ATOMS ATOMS ARE THEREFORE EPISTEMOLOGICALLY DEPENDENT ON COLOURS AND GOALS

A RELATED AND PERHAPS MORE COMPELLING ARGUMENT FOCUSES ON THE ABILITY OF EACH ONTOLOGY TO CAPTURE THINGS IN THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SENSE OF THE TERM THE SCIENTIFIC IMAGE SEEMS TO EXCLUDE BY DESIGN NOTIONS OF AGENCY VALUE ETC EXCLUDE THE NORMATIVE IN FAVOR OF THE DESCRIPTIVE THAT'S WHAT THE VERY FIRST QUESTION AT THE END OF THE TALK IS GETTING AT SEVERAL OF THE QUESTIONS WERE GOOD IF THE SCIENTIFIC IMAGE CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR AGENCY VALUE AND THE NORMATIVE THEN IT CANNOT BE GIVEN PRIMACY WHILE SATISFYING THE PHILOSOPHICAL IMPERATIVE AT LEAST NOT WHILE WE MAINTAIN THAT ANYTHING MATTERS

I'M NOT SURE IT MAKES SENSE TO PREFER ONE OVER THE OTHER AFTER ALL ARE WE TALKING ABOUT PRIMACY IN THE SAME EXACT SENSE IN THE TWO PROPOSITIONS BUT THE QUESTION OF HOW THEY HANG WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE BROADEST POSSIBLE SENSE IS INTERESTING INDEED

ANYWAY I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET SOME OPINIONS ON THE ABOVE I FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM BUT I VERY RARELY SEE IT DISCUSSED IN THAT WAY
AS USUAL I AGREE WITH MOST OF WHAT DENNETT SAYS HOWEVER DOESN'T REFERRING TO CONSCIOUSNESS AS A USER ILLUSION SORT OF CREATE A HOMUNCULUS PROBLEM IT IMPLIES THAT THERE IS A USER WHO IS SEPARATE FROM THE USER INTERFACE THEREFORE THE USER INTERFACE MUST BE TAILORED TO FIT WITH THE USER'S PERCEPTUAL APPARATUS
TO ME THERE ARE LITTLE TO NO ETHICS IN VEGETARIANISM BEYOND THE VEGETARIANS ENJOY

WHEN A PERSON BECOMES VEGETARIAN THEY ARE SIMPLY TRANSFERRING THE CRUELTY OF FLESH ACQUISITION TO THE CRUELTY OF THE DAIRY AND THE EGG INDUSTRY AND UNDENIABLY IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE REALITY OF THE FORMER BECAUSE THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IS THE VEAL INDUSTRY IS THE BEEF INDUSTRY IS THE LEATHER INDUSTRY YOU WILL ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE IS MORE CRUELTY IN A GLASS OF MILK THAN A FREEZER FULL OF SAUSAGES VEGANISM IS TRULY THE ONLY WAY TO ATTAIN A LIFESTYLE IN WHICH HARM TO OTHERS IS MINIMISED ABSOLUTE

THAT BEING SAID IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART OF HISTORY COMMONPLACE TO REFER TO ANCIENT VEGANS AS SOME VARIATION OF VEGETARIAN WITHIN SURVIVING RECORDS SO IT MAY BE THAT HERMARCHUS WAS ACTUALLY A VEGAN OR AT LEAST ENDORSED VEGAN IDEALS
DO YOU FORESEE TRYING TO GET YOUR CONTENT INTO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AT SOME POINT THERE HAS BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION ON THE VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY IN EARLY LIFE EDUCATION BUT VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT TO ACTUALLY APPLY IT IN PRACTICE
U AGNAT ASKS
I AM CONSTANTLY BATTLING MYSELF IN MY EXISTENCE I REALLY ENJOYED YOUR VIDEO ON I THINK THEREFORE I AM BUT WHAT IF THOUGHT ITSELF IS A SIMULATION WATCHING RICK AND MORTY THERE WAS AN EPISODE WHERE MORTY PUTS ON A SIMULATOR HAT THING AND LIVES AN ENTIRE LIFE OF ROY WHAT IF THIS LIFE I AM LIVING IS A SIMULATION LIKE THAT SOMEONE DREAM MAYBE I AM CONFUSED BY WHAT THOUGHT IS DEFINED AS YOU DIDN'T EXPLAIN THAT IN THE VIDEO I THINK THOUGHT IS THE ELECTRICAL LOOPS THAT HAPPEN WITHIN MY BRAIN BECAUSE WITHOUT MY BRAIN THERE IS NO THOUGHT SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE WOULD BE NICE
HI ALL VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE AT R PHILOSOPHY

I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU GO ABOUT DECIDING ON VIDEOS TO MAKE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOPICS YOU HAVE VIDEOS ON AND UNLIKE OTHER FORMS OF ONLINE EDUCATION EAST G MOOCH THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY A UNIFYING THEME SO HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT VIDEOS YOU'RE GOING TO DO NEXT DO YOU GET PARTNERS FIRST AND THEN HAVE THEM CHOOSE TOPICS OR DO YOU HAVE A LIST OF TOPICS YOU WANT DONE AND FIND SUITABLE PARTNERS TO DO THEM

THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING HERE
HI THERE THANKS FOR DOING THIS I WORK AS A COMMUNITY WORKER WITH YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS PARTICULARLY I WORK WITH YOUTH FACING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE CHALLENGES AS A FORMER STUDENT OF PHILOSOPHY I NOTICE MANY PHILOSOPHICAL THEMES COMING UP IN THE WORK I DO WITH MY CLIENTS BUT AM UNSURE OF HOW TO DISCUSS THESE THINGS WITH THEM WITHOUT LEAVING THEM WITH THESE VAST UNANSWERED QUESTIONS JUST PLOPPED IN THEIR LAP MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS DO YOU FEEL THERE ARE ANY GOOD FOUNDATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR INCREASING THEIR AND CRITICAL THINKING OR SIMPLY A CONSTRUCTIVE AND MANAGEABLE WAY OF SPEAKING ABOUT THESE THEMES
U ASKED
FIRST I WANNA THANK YOU FOLKS FOR PUTTING OUT SO MUCH FANTASTIC CONTENT FOR FREE WHAT A COOL PROJECT
I HAVE QUESTIONS

YOU'VE MENTIONED YOU'RE ALWAYS SEEKING VOLUNTEERS TO HELP WITH ANYTHING AT ALL WHAT KINDS OF THINGS DO YOU HAVE IN MIND

2 OTHER THAN MAKING AWESOME VIDEOS WHAT DOES PHILOSOPHY OUTREACH LOOK LIKE I MEAN WHAT ARE SOME OTHER METHODS

KIND OF A RANDOM QUESTION BUT AS EDUCATORS DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE OR ADVISABLE TO TEACH CHILDREN MORAL PHILOSOPHY INCREMENTALLY THROUGHOUT SOMETHING LIKE A K SYSTEM

RUIZ
CAN I ASK HERE I'VE NEVER DONE AN AMA BEFORE

I A LOT OF PHILOSOPHERS CAN BE DRY WHICH PHILOSOPHERS ARE FUN TO READ

II DO YOU ASSENT TO AN UNPOPULAR OR SURPRISING PHILOSOPHICAL POSITION COULD YOU TELL US WHAT IT IS

III WHAT IS A KEY TO SUCCESS THAT MOST GRADUATE STUDENTS OVERLOOK OR DON'T REALIZE

I LOVE YOUR STUFF

U STREITE ASKED
IS PHILOSOPHY USEFUL TO HAVE IN THE REAL WORLD WHILE I LOVE WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS I'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANY PROBLEMS WHERE KNOWING PHILOSOPHY REALLY HELPS THANKS AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
DELETED
WILL YOU BE DOING VIDEOS ON THE MORE ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY I EAST GODEL RUSSELL WITTGENSTEIN
U POTENSDEUS ASKS
WHAT APPROACHES DO YOU TAKE TO BALANCING THE NEED TO CREATE VIDEOS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE WHILE ALSO NOT BEING REDUCTIONIST WHEN DESCRIBING MORE ACADEMIC CONCEPTS
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT ESSENTIALISM IS
SO HERE'S A PRACTICAL QUESTION

I'D LIKE TO READ A LOT MORE PHILOSOPHY BUT I BUMP INTO DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES THE TEXTS ARE BORING AND MAKE ME SLEEPY SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH TO READ SOMETIMES REALLY ALL THE TIME I WORRY THAT I MIGHT BE MISSING SOMETHING

I'D LIKE TO READ MORE READ FASTER AND UNDERSTAND BETTER

WHAT TIPS TRICKS STRATEGIES WIZARDRY DO YOU RECOMMEND TOWARDS THESE ENDS
I THINK IT IS GREAT THAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING THIS MY QUESTION WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WITH PHILOSOPHY PHS CAN DO IN TERMS OF PUSHING OPEN ACCESS EDUCATION AND MAKING ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY ACCESSIBLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC

HELLO WIPHI

LOVE YOUR WORK FIRST OF ALL I'VE BEEN STUDYING SYMBOLIC LOGIC FOR A WHILE NOW AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAVE EVER DONE A VIDEO ON IT IF NOT DO YOU PLAN TO
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU EVEN EXIST
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT A SHORT TEN MINUTE VIDEO CAN CAPTURE THE COMPLEXITIES AND SUBTLETIES OF PHILOSOPHICAL WRITING OR IS IT MERELY AN ENTRY POINT FOR FURTHER READING
QUESTION FOR PAUL BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT MAY BE PERTINENT TO WHAT YOU'RE STUDYING WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON DAVID THEORY OF CAUSATION AS HE DESCRIBES IN HUMEAN SUPERVENIENCE MORE SPECIFICALLY DO YOU KNOW OF ANY CHALLENGES TO THE THEORY AND RESPONSES TO THE THEORY
BIG FAN OF YOUR VIDEOS

WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO AN AMATEUR PHILOSOPHER IN TERMS OF GETTING A BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS BESIDES YOUR VIDEOS THE ONES I'VE WATCHED BY WIPHI TENDED TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC IDEAS OR CONUNDRUMS IS THERE ANYTHING SIMILAR TO WIPHI THAT DISCUSSES THE SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHERS OR SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHY EG EXISTENTIALISM IDEALISM KANTIAN ETHICS ETC
I THINK YOUR VIDEOS ARE GOOD FOR GOING OVER THE BASIC CONCEPTUAL ISSUES INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL TOPICS

HOWEVER IF YOUR CONCERN IS OUTREACH WOULDN'T THERE BE MORE VALUE IN DEALING WITH LESS CLASSICAL PROBLEMS WHICH TEND TO BE QUITE DRY AND TECHNICAL

IN SHORT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GAINED OR LOST IN CHOOSING BETWEEN THE MORE TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC QUESTIONS AND THE SEXIER ONES
U DEUSABSCONDITUS SUGGESTS
YOUR SUCCESS COULD BE MEASURED BY HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HEAR REFERRING TO PHILOSOPHY AS A WAY OF LIFE RATHER THAN JUST A SERIES OF THEORETICAL TOPICS QUESTIONS FIXING THIS MISCONCEPTION ALONE WOULD BE AN UNBELIEVABLE ACHIEVEMENT AND NECESSARY FOR THE MODERN WORLD
U PODARGUS ASKS
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING TOO

DO YOU THINK STUDYING PHILOSOPHY MADE U BETTER WORSE PEOPLE IN TERMS OF MORAL

2 ALSO WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE BEST JOBS WHERE YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY DEGREE MANY PEOPLE I KNOW DON'T REALLY USE PHILOSOPHY AT THEIR JOB AND WORK IN ENTIRE DIFFERENT FIELDS
THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA
HEY GUYS THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK

HOW DIFFICULT DO YOU FIND IT TO BE TO ACCURATELY PORTRAY PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT IN VIDEOS WHEN THEIR MAIN GOAL ARE TO REACH THE GENERAL PUBLIC I FIND THAT MOST ATTEMPTS AT DIVULGATION FALL VICTIM EITHER TO NECESSARY SACRIFICES OR LOSE IMPORTANT NUANCE IN UNNECESSARY BUTCHERING BUT YOU GUYS ARE DOING A GREAT JOB




HI

HAVE WATCHED YOUR VIDEOS BOTH ON AND THROUGH CURIOUS IF YOU GOING TO GO MORE IN DEPTH WITH LOGIC INSTRUCTION AND EXERCISES THE ONES YOU HAVE DONE ARE VERY HELPFUL TO NAIL DOWN EXACT UNDERSTANDING AND APPLICATION OF IT LOOKING TO FIND MORE INTERACTIVE EXERCISES AS WELL AS INSTRUCTION AS I AM TEACHING MYSELF PHILOSOPHY

I HAVE LEARNED A LOT THANKS TO YOUR EFFORT THANK YOU


HI
I THINK THIS IS VERY COOL I SPEND A LOT OF MY SPARE TIME ON KHAN ACADEMY AND I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS GOING ON IN THE WORLD I HAVE NEVER BEEN A STUDENT OF PHILOSOPHY AND I EXPECT MY QUESTION IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN WELL CONSIDERED BUT HERE IT IS GIVEN THAT SOME PEOPLE SEE PURPLE AND SOME SEE GOLD GIVEN THE INCREASINGLY UNDERSTANDING OF REALITY THINKING THOUGHT EXPERIMENT CAN WE SAY THAT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF PURE MATH IS OBJECTIVELY CERTAIN I APPRECIATE THAT WE OFTEN FIND IT NECESSARY TO ASSUME CERTAIN TRUTHS AS BEING SELF-EVIDENT BUT WHAT ARE THOSE TRUTHS IS THERE A STUDY OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL KNOWNS AND UNKNOWNS
PLATO IS A GREAT SPRINGBOARD INTO CRITICAL THOUGHT BUT HIS TRANSLATED WORK IS OFTEN PROHIBITIVELY ACADEMIC FOR MANY I'D LOVE TO SEE A MODERNIZED VIDEO RETELLING OF SOME OF HIS DIALOGUES SIMPLE LANGUAGE MODERN SETTINGS ENTERTAINING RELATABLE AND WELL ACTED SCENES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PLANT SOME PHILOSOPHY SEEDS IN PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T NORMALLY GO AND READ SOME ON THEIR OWN WHILE ALSO PROVIDING DISCUSSION GROUNDS FOR PHILOSOPHY VETS

IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS THE SORT OF THING YOU'D GUYS BE INTERESTED IN OR DO I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE FILMS MYSELF
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN ASKED ABOUT GETTING PHILOSOPHY IN SCHOOLS FOR CHILDREN BUT WITHOUT THE EXAMPLE OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM COULD YOU UNPACK WHY PHILOSOPHY COULD BE USEFUL TO EVEN VERY YOUNG CHILDREN

ANECDOTALLY I DISCOVERED MARCUS AURELIUS WHEN I WAS USED A BOOK LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND USED THE IDEAS WITHIN IT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER YET
WHAT'S THE YOUNGEST AGE THAT YOU THINK CAN ALREADY GRASP THE BASICS OF PHILOSOPHY ASSUMING THERE IS
WHAT ABOUT VIDEOS IN SPANISH OR SPANISH SUBTITLES
HAYA
I'M CURRENTLY AN ENGLISH MAJOR WITH A SPECIALIZATION IN LITERATURE WITH A LONG TERM GOAL OF GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL FOR PHILOSOPHY AND THEN EITHER GETTING MY DOCTORATE IN LITERARY THEORY AND CRITICISM OR PHILOSOPHY NOT QUITE SURE WHICH

SOME NEBULOUS QUESTIONS BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR A PARTICULAR PRIMARY SOURCE TO BEGIN WITH OR A GOOD BOOK THAT TALKS ABOUT THE MAJOR AREAS IN PHILOSOPHY AND WHO WOULD YOU SAY ARE SOME OF THE MOST CUTTING EDGE PHILOSOPHERS TODAY
HAVE YOU GUYS TRIED BECOMING THE KHAN ACADEMY OF PHILOSOPHY

FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND YOU GUYS HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING ABOUT MY ISSUE WITH PHILOSOPHY VIDEOS ON THE INTERNET IS THAT THEY'RE ALMOST ALWAYS MINUTES IN LENGTH AND CAN NEVER GO IN DEPTH ABOUT A CERTAIN PHILOSOPHY I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE ABLE TO FIND A SERIES OF VIDEOS COVERING SOMETHING LIKE GROUNDWORK THAT HAS A SINGLE VIDEO DEDICATED TO A GIVEN SECTION IDEA IN THE BOOK SIMILAR TO HOW KHAN HAS A VIDEO FOR EACH CONCEPT IN SAY CALCULUS

DO YOU GUYS PLAN ON DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE THAT SHOWING PEOPLE PHILOSOPHY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SERVING PEOPLE ADS ON YOUTUBE WITH SUCH A VIEW COUNT I'M SURE YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT

EVEN ON THIS SUB I'VE FREQUENTLY SEEN CHEAP CLICKBAIT VIDEOS THAT APPEARS TO ME TO BE INTENDED MORE TO PUSH PEOPLE TO WATCH ADS THAN TO TEACH THEM ABOUT PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THE VERY ABSENCE OF ADS ON YOUR VIDEOS GREATLY ENCOURAGES ME TO UNVOTE YOUR SUBMISSIONS
I CHOSE TO BE AN AGNOSTIC TENDING TOWARDS THE IDEA THAT THERE IS NO GOD IF I HAD TO DECIDE ON MY PHILOSOPHICAL SEARCH TO FIND MEANING AND PURPOSE WITHOUT A GOD I'VE FOUND SARTRE AND CAMUS I FELL IN LOVE WITH CAMUS FEELING IDEA OF THE ABSURD AND HIS STRUGGLE TO FIGHT IT TO MY KNOWLEDGE ONLY CAMUS AND MAYBE SARTRE FOLLOWED THEIR ARGUMENTATION THAT THERE IS NO GOD IN THIS STRICT MANNER FOR EXAMPLE KIERKEGAARD MADE HIS LEAP OF FAITH IN THE END FOR WHICH HE WAS CRITICISED BY CAMUS

CAN YOU RECOMMEND MORE PHILOSOPHERS AND MODERN DAY PHILOSOPHERS THAT FOLLOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF CAMUS AND THE FRENCH EXISTENTIALISTS ARGUING WHY AND HOW TO LIVE HIS LIFE WITHOUT GOD MEANING AND PURPOSE

I LIKE HOW I READ THIS AFTER DROPPING OUT OF PHILOSOPHY
AS A ARMY INFANTRY VETERAN PURSUING A PHD IN PHILOSOPHY WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU HAVE TO THOSE WHO WANT TO FOLLOW THE PATH OF PHD AT UNIVERSITY DO YOU THINK HAVING THAT INFANTRY EXPERIENCE COULD HELP ME IN A SPECIFIC FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY

I'M BIG INTO HELPING AND BRING A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON SITUATIONS TO LIGHT I'M JUST STARTING OFF COLLEGE SO I HAVE THE WORLD AHEAD OF ME AND WOULD LOVE ADVICE FROM YOU GUYS
HELLO TO GEOFF LYNN

I STUDIED PHILOSOPHY WITH GRANT STERLING BRIAN BEAKLEY DANNIE OTTO AND GARY AYLESWORTH AS WELL AS SOME OTHER FANTASTIC PROFESSORS AT EASTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY

PERHAPS YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM

IF NOT I JUST WANTED TO SAY HELLO AS ONE ILLINOIS TO ANOTHER
HI DO YOU EVER FELT PRESSURE TO ONLY PRESENT MORE PHILOSOPHIES WHICH ARE DEEMED SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE THESE DAYS IE HAVE YOU EVER HAD IDEAS SO ABHORRENT THAT YOU DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE PRESENTING OR MAKING TALKS ABOUT
DO YOU WILL YOU MAKE VIDEOS ABOUT CRITICAL THEORY FOUCAULT BAUDRILLARD DERRID ANG
DELETED
HELLO HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT GETTING AN AUTISTIC OR OTHER SPECIAL NEEDS KID INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY AT A YOUNG AGE UNDER
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR VIDEOS DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR A FRESHMAN IN UNDERGRAD STATE SCHOOL HOPING TO ONE DAY ATTEND GRAD SCHOOL IN PHILOSOPHY
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND DOWNSIDES OF MOOCH VERSUS SOMETHING LIKE YOUR VIDEOS THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT PHILOSOPHY MOOCH NOWADAYS WITH PROMINENT EXAMPLES LIKE COURSE ON JUSTICE AND JUDGING BY SOME OF YOUR ANSWERS HERE YOU ALL ARE MOVING TOWARDS MORE SERIES WHICH LOOK A LOT LIKE MOOCH SO IF YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EDUCATIONAL MODEL YOU'RE ENGAGING IN AND THE MDOC ONE THAT WOULD BE GREAT
HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT REACHING AN AUDIENCE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY DID THIS COST YOU MONEY WHAT WAS YOUR STRATEGY AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS THANKS
AT WHAT POINT CAN A PERSON BE CALLED A PHILOSOPHER DOES IT ONLY APPLY TO THOSE WITH A DEGREE IF SO IS ANY PHILOSOPHER WITH A DEGREE CONSIDERED EQUAL TO OTHERS MORE SEASONED ONES
DOES ONE REALLY HAVE TO START WITH THE GREEKS TO TACKLE HEGEL
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO ESCAPE AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS
I SAW SOMETHING THAT SAID YOU ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEERS WHAT SORTS OF THINGS FOR
WHO DO YOU GUYS THINK WILL BE THE NEXT GREAT PHILOSOPHER WHO IS SOMEONE IN THE CENTURY TO LOOK OUT FOR SUCH AS THEIR WORKS AND WHAT NOT BETTER WORDS WHAT DOES BEING A PHILOSOPHER LOOK LIKE TODAY IN
I'M A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT OF EPISTEMOLOGY WE'VE RECENTLY BEEN DISCUSSING MATHEMATICS AS A WAY OF KNOWING OFTEN COMPARING IT TO ART OR LANGUAGE AS COOL AS THOSE COMPARISONS ARE I'D LIKE TO GO FURTHER WHAT ARE SOME INTERESTING TEXTS OR ARTICLES THAT EXPLORE THE HUMAN PSYCHE THROUGH MATH
WHAT IS THE THINKING BEHIND CLIMATE CHANGE DENIAL DO YOU THINK THE PURVEYORS OF FOSSIL FUEL ARE NIHILISTS
I'M INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING PHENOMENOLOGY AND I HAVEN'T MADE MUCH PROGRESS WITH THE LITERATURE I'VE FOUNDATION IT SEEMS AS IF IT'S WRITTEN TO KEEP THE WHOLE ENTERPRISE MYSTERIOUS XD I WOULD BE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL IF YOU MADE A VIDEO OR SOMETHING THAT GAVE CURIOUS AND PHILOSOPHICALLY UNDERPOWERED PEOPLE LIKE ME A VIEW INTO THIS AREA I'VE SEEN IT MENTIONED IN INTERACTION LITERATURE I'M DOING A MASTER'S IN COMPUTER SCIENCE NOW AND I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE BESIDES MY HAVING A CRUSH ON THE DIFFICULT WRITINGS ON THE SUBJECT I'VE COME ACROSS GOT TO BE EXCITING CAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO READ
SO GLAD YOU'RE DOING THIS THANKS

QUESTION WHAT OTHER PROJECTS AND MEDIUMS WILL WIPHI EXPLORE IN THE FUTURE
OH NO I MISSED IT JUST IN CASE I'LL STILL ASK MY QUESTION

I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON MY UNDERGRADUATE THESIS ON PERSONAL IDENTITY MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW OUR IDENTITY IS SHAPED ON SOCIAL MEDIA INTERNET I WAS WONDERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT EFFECT SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES HAS ON ONE'S IDENTITY

THANKS
CAN I USE SOME OF YOUR MATERIAL TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY IN A LOCAL CAFE HOW WOULD THAT WORK
HOW DO I GET INTO PHILOSOPHY
I'M ABOUT TO BEGIN WATCHING THE EPISTEMOLOGY PLAYLIST SO PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF THESE QUESTIONS ARE ALREADY ANSWERED THERE

IS THERE A CORRECT EPISTEMOLOGY IF NOT WHOSE OR WHAT EPISTEMOLOGY DO YOU MOST AGREE WITH

ALSO SAME QUESTIONS FOR ETHICS

THANKS
I'VE READ SOMEWHERE ON THE INTERNET PLEASE EXCUSE MY TERRIBLE SOURCE REFERENCE THAT MODERN PHILOSOPHY COMING TO A HALT THAT THERE ISN'T BREAKING NEW IDEA IN PHILOSOPHY ANYMORE HOW TRUE IS THAT SENTIMENT
HAYA

SO I'M CURRENTLY AT A HIGH SCHOOL THAT TEACHES PHILOSOPHY INTERMIXED WITHIN THE OTHER BOOKS FOR OUR ENGLISH CLASS WHICH IS DISCUSSION BASED I PERSONALLY FIND PHILOSOPHY FAIRLY BORING TO READ AND NOT FULFILLING BECAUSE YOU NEVER REACH A CONCLUSION YOU ONLY REALLY LOOK AT DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES AND HOW SOME ARE FALSE CIRC AT THE END OF THE MENO ARISTOTLE EVEN SAYS HE CANNOT PUT FORTH AN ANSWER BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW SO MY QUESTION IS HOW WOULD YOU APPROACH APPRECIATION OF PHILOSOPHY TO GET PEOPLE LIKE ME TO START FINDING IT WORTHWHILE TO READ AND NOT JUST DO IT FOR HOMEWORK BECAUSE YOUR TEACHER TELLS YOU TO
CAN YOU MAKE VIDEOS ON THEORIES ALSO PHENOMENAL CONSERVATISM COMMONSENSE EPISTEMOLOGY REFORMED EPISTEMOLOGY
HELLO WIPHI TEAM
WORDS CANNOT ADEQUATELY EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR WHAT YOU GUYS DO IN PAST STUDIES OF PHILOSOPHY AT TIMES I FELT TEXTS WERE TOO VERBOSE AND VAGUE
THE CONTENT WIPHI MAKES IS ACCESSIBLE DIGESTIBLE AND CONCISE ENOUGH TO GIVE VIEWERS THE IMPORTANT POINTS YET STILL ENCOURAGE EXPLORING FURTHER DETAILS ABSOLUTELY GREAT WORK

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON PHILOSOPHY IN POPULAR CULTURE
USUALLY I HAVE A GOOD LAUGH WHEN ZIZEL REFERS TO A FILM WHEN MAKING A CASE HOWEVER IN GENERAL DISCUSSIONS I FIND IT LAMENTABLE THAT PEOPLE CAN BE QUICK TO DISMISS POPULAR CULTURE EXAMPLES AS LOW BROW OR AS IF REAL PHILOSOPHY IS THE RESERVE OF STUFFY OLD MEN SPEAKING IN IMPENETRABLE VERSES
IN MY OWN LIFE REFERRING TO THE MATRIX HAS BEEN INVALUABLE IN BRINGING PEOPLE IN VARYING STATES OF SOBRIETY INTO DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE CARTESIAN COGITO ERGO SUM AS MY OWN INEBRIATED ATTEMPTS TO PRESENT THE EVIL DEMON OR THE MODERN BRAIN IN A JAR EXAMPLES END UP BEING TOO FUZZY
IF WHAT YOUR DOING DOES GET PUT BEGIN A GRAYWALL WHAT AM I GOING TO HAVE TO PAY TO USE YOUR SERVICES
HOW ARE YOU FUNDED

SORRY TO ASK A QUESTION BUT I CAN'T SEE ANY INFORMATION ON THIS ON YOUR WEBSITE IS A COMMERCIAL STARTUP A CHARITY OR A HOBBY
HI I DISCOVERED YOUR CHANNEL THROUGH A MDOC ON DDX BY CASPAR HARE SINCE THIS DISCUSSION IS ABOUT PUBLIC PHILOSOPHY OUTREACH I WANTED TO SUGGEST ADDING MORE PHILOSOPHY BOOKS TO THE OVERDRIVE LIBRARY SYSTEM PRESENTLY WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR BOOKS ABOUT PHILOSOPHY ONLY A FEW TITLES ARE AVAILABLE

ALSO IF POSSIBLE CAN YOU SUGGEST A FEW NOVEL UNFREQUENTED SOURCES I CAN USE TO CONTINUE MY EDUCATION
RESEARCH JOURNALS WEBSITES BOOKS ETC

THANKS
HI I HOPE I'M NOT TOO LATE MY QUESTION IS WHY DO YOU THINK PHILOSOPHY ISN'T MORE POPULAR IT SEEMS TO BE A COMMON VIEW THAT PEOPLE ESPECIALLY CHILDREN ARE NATURALLY INCLINED TO ASK PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS YET AN INTEREST IN PHILOSOPHY BEYOND A CERTAIN AGE IS OFTEN SEEN AS A BIT WEIRD

IS IT SIMPLY A LACK OF EXPOSURE AND RESOURCES THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE TO BEGINNERS

CHEERS I'M A BIG FAN OF YOUR VIDEOS

WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH RESOURCES TO GIVE FOOD AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO ANYBODY WHO NEEDS IT AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT TAKING CARE OF THE VULNERABLE SICK HUNGRY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND THAT WE HAVE A DUTY TO DO SO BUT THE SMALL AMOUNT OF CHARITIES GOVERNMENT AID DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO FIXING THESE PROBLEMS IT SEEMS SO BIZARRE THAT RIGHT NOW MILLIONS OF PEOPLE NEED HELP AND THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING ANY I FEEL LIKE FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE GOING TO LOOK BACK ON US AND JUDGE US FOR OUR INACTION SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY DO YOU THINK SOCIETIES HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE DOING THE RIGHT THING ARE WE ALL INCREDIBLY SELFISH FOR NOT MARCHING IN THE STREETS AND DEMANDING A CHANGE
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE PHILOSOPHER MAX STERNER
REMOVED
I'M HOPING TO SEE YOUR WORK IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS SOMEDAY SOON
WHO DO YOU THINK ARE GOOD PHILOSOPHERS TO STUDY I KNOW THERE ARE MANY BUT A GOOD STARTING OFF POINT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO SELF-EDUCATION FOR MYSELF THANK YOU IN ADVANCE
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO USE PHILOSOPHY TO HELP SOLVE THE GREATEST ISSUE OF OUR TIME ENDLESS WAR
WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES OF A GOOD PRESIDENT
PHILOSOPHY HAS FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE AND HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC THINKING WHY BOTHER BRINGING BACK AN OUTDATED WAY OF DOING THINGS AND THINKING ABOUT THE WORLD WHEN THERE IS A GREAT PERFECTLY WELL OILED MACHINE CALLED SCIENCE
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS IT'S AN INTERESTING READ OR AT LEAST THE DOZEN OR SO PAGES I'VE READ SO FAR ARE INTERESTING

BUT I FEEL LIKE TURNER HAD FAR TOO MUCH FUN WRITING THIS PAPER FOR EXAMPLE WHEN TALKING ABOUT PERORATIONAL NIHILISTS

BUT THE PERORATIONAL NIHILIST THEN WOULD PROVIDE US WITH NO POSITIVE METAPHYSICAL THESIS ABOUT HOW THE WORLD IS STRUCTURED HE WOULD SAY NOTHING ABOUT HOW TO FILL THE GAP THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE FILL WITH HOLES
ABSTRACT

ONTOLOGICAL NIHILISM IS THE THESIS THAT THERE IS NOTHING AT ALL
ALMOST NOBODY BELIEVES IT BUT THIS DOES NOT MAKE IT PHILOSOPHICALLY UNINTERESTING
WE CAN COME TO BETTER UNDERSTAND A PROPOSITION BY STUDYING ITS OPPOSITE
BY BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT ONTOLOGICAL NIHILISM IS AND WHAT PROBLEMS
BESET IT WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND JUST WHAT WE SAY WHEN WE SAY THAT THERE
ARE SOME THINGS

THIS PAPER EXPLORES ONTOLOGICAL NIHILISM AND FOR JUST THIS REASON AFTER
DISCUSSING WHAT THE THESIS WOULD AMOUNT TO IF IT WERE TO HAVE ANY PLAUSIBILITY
WHATSOEVER I PRESENT 2 AND CLARIFY A CRUCIAL CHALLENGE FOR IT I SHOW
WHAT IS WRONG WITH TWO LESS PLAUSIBLE ATTEMPTS TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE AND
THEN ARGUE THAT THE PROPOSAL THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE MUCH MORE PROMISING
SUCCUMBS TO THE SAME PROBLEMS AS THE LESS PROMISING ATTEMPTS AND IT
TURNS OUT THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE ONTOLOGICAL NIHILISM VIABLE WITHOUT SMUGGLING
AN ONTOLOGY IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR WE NEED A BLOATED IDEOLOGY INDEFINITELY
MANY BRUTE NECESSARY CONNECTIONS AND A DEEP-SEATED HOLISM ABOUT THE STRUCTURE
OF REALITY ONCE WE UNDERSTAND WHY THESE ARE COSTS OF THE VIEW WE SEE JUST
WHAT WE GAIN BY THINKING OF THE WORLD AS BUILT UP OUT OF THINGS

AUTHOR

JASON TURNER ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY
EMBRACE A HOLISTIC PICTURE OF REALITY REMINDS ME OF BUDDHISM
WHAT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WAS HOW AN AI COULD SIMULTANEOUSLY BE THREATENING TO OUR SPECIES AND NOT UNDERSTAND BASIC ETHICAL NORMS WHICH STRUCTURE EVERYDAY HUMAN LIFE WHY DO WE ALWAYS ASSOCIATE SUPERINTELLIGENCE WITH A RUTHLESS DISREGARD OF SUFFERING
AREN'T MORALS JUST ONES OWN DEPICTION OF RIGHT AND WRONG I THINK ETHICS ARE THE DECISION EXPECTATIONS FOR MAKING GOOD AND BAD CHOICES IN SOCIETY
I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO QUESTION THE BASIS OF MORALS BEFORE WE CONTINUE WITH AI ESPECIALLY VIOLENT COMBAT AI BECAUSE I WOULD ARGUE THAT ALL HUMANS ARE MORAL AND YET ALL HUMANS ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF ATROCITIES
I DONT THINK THE QUESTION IS CAN THEY BE MORAL THE PROBLEM IS WE DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON INSIDE OF DEEP LEARNING MACHINES AND THEY ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF CONVEYING ONE IDEA BUT PURSUE ANOTHER THATS LIKE THE FIRST THING THEY ACCOMPLISHED WHEN THEY WON THE GO GAMES BY SETTING TRAPS BUT ALL IN ALL IM FOR THEM MIGHT AS WELL GO FOR IT OR AT LEAST FIGHT IT OUT TERMINATOR STYLE

WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE COME INTO EXISTENCE I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD GUESS THAT THE ODDS ARE QUITE LONG PEOPLE GENERALLY BELIEVE A THAT THEY EXIST AND B THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THINGS GONE DIFFERENTLY IN THE TIME BEFORE THEY WERE CONCEIVED THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT HAD THAT SPERM NOT JOINED WITH THAT OVUM THEN YOU WOULD NOT EXIST

THIS ARGUMENT POPS UP IN CREATIONISM DEBATES OCCASIONALLY AND I QUESTION ITS USEFULNESS THE ARGUMENT IS OF THE FORM INCIDENT X COINCIDING WITH Y IS RARE THEREFORE OUR REALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL THINGS PROBABLY BEEN VERY DIFFERENT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PROBABLY OF X IS VERY HIGH AND THE PROBABLY OF X COINCIDING WITH A SET CONTAINING Y GIVEN THAT X HAPPENED IS ALMOST CERTAIN IN MORE CONCRETE TERMS THE PROBABILITY OF SOME PERSON WINNING THE LOTTERY IS VERY SMALL BUT THE PROBABILITY OF SOMEONE WINNING THE LOTTERY IS VERY HIGH

LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IN ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE SURE BUT THAT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIFE SURE YOU HOWEVER YOU DEFINE YOURSELF MAY BE A SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE AMONG THE POSSIBLE UNIVERSES BUT YOU ARE STILL A SNOWFLAKE THE ODDS OF YOU HAPPENING IN SOME FORM WERE VERY VERY HIGH INDEED

THE ONLY WAY FOR INDEXICAL TO BE THE ANSWER TO WHY I EXIST RIGHT NOW RATHER THAN NOT IS IF WE REJECT THE GAMETE CLAIM AND ASSUME THAT MY EXISTENCE DIDN T DEPEND ON THOSE GAMETES

YOU CAN TAKE THIS MULTIPLE WAYS ARE YOU ARE STILL YOU REGARDLESS OF GAMETES OR ARE YOU MERELY WHATEVER THE GAMETES HAPPENED TO PRODUCED I DON'T THINK THE FORMER MAKES MUCH SENSE BUT SINCE SOMETHING SIMILAR WAS GOING TO BE THE PRODUCT OF WHATEVER GAMETES REGARDLESS SOME COMBINATIONS BEING BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT NONETHELESS IT PROBABLY IS ABOUT AS RELEVANT AS WHICH PERSON WINS THE NEXT LOTTERY HOW RELEVANT THAT ACTUALLY IS I DO NOT KNOW

THE DICTIONARY DOESN'T EXACTLY HELP MATTERS HERE IF YOU LIVE IN A MULTIVERSE AND CAN MEET YOUR COUNTERPART FROM ANOTHER VERSE IS THAT PERSON YOU IN WHAT SENSE
IT IS AN INTERESTING IF LONG READ

I WOULD CONTEND WITH YOUR TITLE THE ODDS OF YOU EXISTING GIVEN DETERMINISM THE PROBABILITY OF YOU EXISTING IF EVERYTHING HAS STRICT CAUSE AND EFFECT THEN THINGS COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED DIFFERENTLY

PUT ANOTHER WAY THE ONLY HAS MEANING IN A SYSTEM THAT IS INHERENTLY REPEATING WHEN I FLICK THE SWITCH THE LIGHTS TURN ON WHEN I FLICK THE SWITCH AGAIN THE LIGHTS TURN OFFICIAL IF IN THE FUTURE I FLICK THE SWITCH THE LIGHTS WILL TURN ON ETC THIS IS ENTIRELY COHERENT BUT TO SAY IF I HADN'T FLIPPED THE SWITCH THE LIGHT WOULDN'T HAVE TURNED ON IS INCORRECT SINCE IF I HADN'T FLIPPED THE SWITCH IS A CONDITION WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE IF DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN ANY PAST WHERE I DIDN'T FLIP THE SWITCH DOESN'T EXIST AND THEREFORE STATEMENTS REGARDING THAT PAST ARE NECESSARILY FALSE

BUT QUANTUM MECHANICS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS ONLY GOVERNS INCREDIBLY TINY THINGS WHEN DEALING WITH PEOPLE SIZED OBJECTS MOVING AT NORMAL SPEEDS NEWTONIAN MECHANICS WORKS JUST FINE QM NM FOR NORMAL OBJECTS OR TO BE MORE SPECIFIC NM IS A SPECIAL CASE OF QM WHICH ONLY APPLIES TO NORMAL OBJECTS NOW IN THE PAST HUNDRED YEARS OR SO WE HAVE FOUND WAYS OF MAKING TRULY SMALL THINGS IMPACT LARGER SYSTEMS EXPERIMENTS WHICH EXPLICITLY PROBE QM BUT OUTSIDE OF A PHYSICS LABORATORY NOTHING IN OUR DAY-TO-DAY LIVES ABIDES BY QM BUT NOT NM

THEREFORE UNLESS YOUR PARENTS CHOSE TO HAVE KIDS BASED ON THE RESULTS OF A QM EXPERIMENT THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU EXIST

A FINAL OBJECTION MIGHT BE QM AND OTHER STRANGE PHYSICS WAS AT WORK IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE MAYBE THERE IS A CHANCE THAT IT COULD HAVE WORKED OUT DIFFERENTLY THE ISSUE WITH THIS IS THAT IF THE EARLY UNIVERSE ENDS UP CAUSING YOU NOT TO EXIST IT PROBABLY ALSO CAUSES THE UNIVERSE TO NOT EXIST I WOULD CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF THE PROBABILITY OF YOU EXISTING IS CONDITIONAL UPON THERE EXISTING AT LEAST SOMEONE TO PONDER THE QUESTION THEREFORE UNIVERSES WHICH GENERATE ABSOLUTELY NO LIFE OUGHT NOT COUNT AGAINST THE PROBABILITY OF YOUR NOT EXISTING

THEREFORE AGAIN THE PROBABILITY YOU EXIST
I LOOK FORWARD TO FINISHING YOUR ESSAY WHEN I GET THE CHANCE BUT I MUST POINT OUT YOUR MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT SEXUAL REPRODUCTION RECOMBINATION OR SHUFFLING HAPPENS WHENEVER GAMETES FUSE AND THIS PROCESS IS ESSENTIALLY RANDOM SO THE EMBRYO FORMED ON THE SPACESHIP WOULD BE UTTERLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE FORMED ON EARTH THIS IS WHY PARFAIT PRESUMABLY GAVE IMPORTANCE TO TIME IN HIS VERSION OF INDEED IF MY FATHER HAD SNEEZED A SECOND BEFORE CONCEIVING ME AND DELAYED THE FUSION OF SPERM AND EGG I WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN BORN ANOTHER PERSON POSSIBLY OF A DIFFERENT SEX WOULD EXIST IN MY PLACE
LETTER ON HUMANISM I THINK IS A GREAT RESPONSE TO THIS TEXT EXISTENTIALISM IS IN MANY WAYS TOO TIED UP WITH A CARTESIAN WORLD-VIEW WHICH HEIDEGGER IS QUICK TO CORRECT

MOST NOTABLY I THINK HE'S VERY RIGHT TO CRITICIZE EXISTENCE PRECEDES ESSENCE BY POINTING OUT THAT IT FUNDAMENTALLY BELONGS TO A CARTESIAN METAPHYSICAL TRADITION OWN REFRAMING OF THIS ADAGE AS EXISTENCE IS ESSENCE ACTUALLY ALLOWS EXISTENTIALISM TO COME INTO ITSELF
FUN FACT THE FIRST TIME HE PRESENTED THIS PAPER DELEUZE WAS A YEAR OLD IN THE AUDIENCE WHO WALKED OUT IN DISTASTE OVER WHAT HE WAS HEARING
SO DOES ANYONE FEEL THIS IS IN CONTRAST OR COUNTER IN ANY WAY TO ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY OR DO THEY BOTH WORK TOGETHER
I BELIEVE THE CONCEPT OF PURPOSE IS A RATHER WHAT IS MORE DESIRABLE IS THE CONCEPT OF STRIVING FOR PURPOSE OR PURPOSES

ACHIEVEMENT OF PURPOSE OR LACK OF GENUINE PURPOSE OFTEN TRIGGERS THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS IN EXISTENTIALISM

GIVE A MAN ENOUGH LOGS OF WOOD TO BUILD A HOUSE AND HIS MIND IS DRIVEN BY THE FINAL ACQUISITION OF THE HOUSE BUT IF THE HOUSE WAS BUILT THEN HE QUESTIONS WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME PERHAPS HE IS HAPPIEST BEING A CARPENTER AND IF THE HOUSE TAKES YEARS TO BUILD ON HIS OWN HE WILL SULK AGAIN PERHAPS THERE IS MORE TO JUST BEING A CARPENTER

BILL CLINTON HAD A GREAT QUOTE YOU KNOW YOU ARE GETTING OLD WHEN YOU HAVE MORE MEMORIES THAN DREAMS

AS A SOFTWARE PROGRAMMER WHO SPENDS MONTHS ON ONE SPECIFIC PROJECT I CAN SAY ME AND MY TEAM TEND TO BE HAPPIEST WHEN WE ARE CLOSE TO COMPLETION BECAUSE COMPLETION THOUGH IS JOYFUL ONLY FOR A DAY OR TWO IT IS SOON FORGOTTEN AS THE CYCLE MUST START AGAIN

I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THE HUMAN MIND IS BUILT FOR STRIVING IT IS A PURPOSE IN ITSELF
THE ONLY THING I WAS THINKING WAS THAT WAS AN INEFFICIENT WAY OF CUTTING OUT THOSE COOKIES LOOK AT ALL THAT WASTED DOUGH
DOES ANYONE BY ANY CHANCE KNOW OF ANY ANSWER TO THAT BY A RELIGIOUS CHRISTIAN
THIS THREAD IS REALLY FOCUSED ON ARGUMENT BUT CAN SOMEONE HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT SARTRE MEANT BY CLAIMING WE LIVE IN A WORLD DID HIS IDEAS OF EXISTENTIALISM MANDATE THAT AT ONE POINT GOD EXISTED STILL EXISTS THAT SEEMS LIKE A DIFFERENT SUBJECT ENTIRELY MANDATORY SORRY IF THIS IS A DUMB QUESTION I'M AN AMATEUR PHILOSOPHER AND ONLY TOOK A COUPLE CLASSES IN COLLEGE SOME OF YOU CATS REALLY KNOW YOUR STUFF
SARTRE IS GIVEN WAAAAAAAY TOO MUCH CREDIT IN ESTABLISHING EXISTENTIALISM WHEN KIERKEGAARD ESTABLISHED IT MUCH EARLIER AND WAS FAR LESS HYPOCRITICAL IN HIS BELIEFS THAN SARTELL WAS
BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS
I WROTE A SCIENCE FICTION BOOK ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE THAT RELIED HEAVILY ON HUMANISM BUT WHICH INCLUDED GOD AS A FACTOR I STILL THINK EXISTENTIALISM IS THE MOST PRODUCTIVE PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNING FOR EVERYDAY LIVES
I'VE NEVER SEEN CANCER THIS AGGRESSIVE
I AGREE THAT IT IS A PART OF HUMANISM THE EMPOWERMENT THIS PHILOSOPHY GIVES TO PEOPLE OVER THEIR OWN LIVES AND ACTIONS IS A POSITIVE FORCE THE CONCEPT OF CHOICE SHOULD ALTHOUGH NOT BE TAKEN TO THE EXTREME HOWEVER I DO NOT THINK IT IS A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE HUMAN CONDITION
REMOVED
FOR A MOMENT I READ THAT AS CHUCK PALAHNIUK AND ASSUMED THE ESSAY WOULD BE ABOUT HORRIBLE SEXUAL INJURIES
KLOSTERMAN EDGES UP TO AN INTERESTING QUESTION BUT THEN REFUSES TO GO WHERE IT LEADS WHAT WILL THE FUTURE THINK ARE OUR MORAL FAILURES YOU CAN BE SURE IT WON'T BE THE EASY OBVIOUS CANDIDATES
NOT VERY LONG BUT VERY CONFUSING FOR ME TO SAY THE LEAST
I BELIEVE LIBERAL VALUES SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE BUT I FEEL AS IF LIBERALISM AND EVEN LABELLING VALUES AS LIBERAL TURNS TOO MANY PEOPLE OFF OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES SINCE IT IS SO TIED TO POLITICS IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO RELIGION THE THINGS MOST PEOPLE CONSIDER TO BE LIBERAL VALUES I PREFER TO CALL HUMAN DECENCY ON THAT NOTE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LIBERAL VALUES CAN BE ABSOLUTE UNTIL EACH OF THE WORLDS RELIGIONS FINISHES ADAPTING TO THE RAPID CHANGE IN CONSCIOUSNESS WE ARE STILL EXPERIENCING
IT WAS QUITE AN INTERESTING READ ALTHOUGH TO THE CRITICAL READER IT WAS NOT PERSUASIVE THE IDEA THAT VALUE CLAIMS ARE UP FOR DISCUSSION IS AN WESTERN LIBERAL NOTION I'M SYMPATHIC TOWARDS PRAGMATISM BUT IT COULD LEADS TO ALL SORTS OF HORRIBLE THINGS SUCH AS GENOCIDE SIMPLY BECAUSE IT WORKS TO FULFILL SOME GOAL PERHAPS A FORM OF SOFT ABSOLUTISM IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL POLITICAL ORDER SPECIFICALLY IN A MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY
I DID NOT READ THE ENTIRE ARTICLE BUT I DO BELIEVE THIS ABSOLUTION COMES FROM THE IDEA THAT THE CULTURE OR TRADITION PEOPLE OR GENERATION OF FAMILIES BRING INTO WESTERN SOCIETY DOES NOT DAMAGE THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU MANY CULTURES HAVE INTEGRATED INTO WESTERN CULTURE CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR IS DEEPLY ENTRENCHED WITH THE SPANISH CULTURE IN MUCH THE SAME WAY CANADA RELATIONSHIP WITH FRANCE STANDS AS SUCH THE PROBLEM ONLY ARRIVES WHEN A DIFFERENT CULTURE WILLINGLY STEPS ON OTHERS SAY WOMEN IN THE CASE OF TO LARGE A COMMUNITY OF EXTREMISTS IN ISLAMIC CULTURE AND WESTERN SOCIETY AS A WHOLE STAND FOR THAT ASPECT WHEN OUR SOCIETY IS BUILT ON THE PROGRESSION OF BOTH MEN AND WOMEN I BELIEVE WE CANNOT SO IN ESSENCE THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM WITH LIBERAL IDEALS JUST A DISCONNECT BETWEEN IDEALS AND CULTURE PERHAPS I MISUNDERSTOOD BUT THE IDEA THAT WE CAN ALL GET ALONG IS A BIT NAIVE
I AM ALWAYS AMUSED BY THE CONCEIT THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO LEARN FROM ALL COMMUNITIES THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS WE MIGHT LEARN ABOUT RESPECT FOR ELDERS FROM IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES I DISAGREE I THINK ALL ARGUMENTS FOR THE RESPECT FOR ELDERS ARE ALREADY COVERED IN THINKING

THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ALMOST NO REDEEMING QUALITIES THAT IS WE ARE AWARE OF ALL THEIR GOOD QUALITIES AND THE REST OF THEIR BELIEFS SHOULD BE DISCARDED

CONSIDER THE ANTE-BELLUM SOUTHERN I DO NOT THINK WE HAVE ANYTHING TO LEARN FROM THEIR SOCIETY THAT WE HAVE NOT ALREADY INTERNALIZED IN AN ANALOGOUS WAY THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE LIFE LESSONS THAT WE WILL LEARN FROM NEW COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY WHEN THOSE COMMUNITIES COME FROM SOCIETIES TO WHICH WE HAVE LONG EXPOSURE FOR EXAMPLE WESTERN EUROPE HAS HAD CULTURAL INTERCHANGE WITH THE ISLAMIC WORLD SINCE SHORTLY AFTER THE BIRTH OF ISLAM

THE CLAIM THAT OTHER TRADITIONS HAVE UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE ASSUMES THAT NON WESTERN PEOPLE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN WESTERN PEOPLE MY EXPERIENCE WOULD SUGGEST THE OPPOSITE MOST PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD ARE VERY SIMILAR NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS EXIST AND MOST PROGRESS COMES FROM THE EXCEPTIONS THESE EXCEPTIONS USUALLY REQUIRE A LARGE AMOUNT OF SOCIETAL SUPPORT SOCRATES COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT A CITY LIKE CLASSICAL ATHENS NOR SPINOZA WITHOUT CENTURY AMSTERDAM THESE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS ARE QUITE RARE WHICH AFFECTS THE DISTRIBUTION OF EXCEPTION INDIVIDUALS
ARE THERE PHILOSOPHERS THAT HOLD THAT PANPSYCHISM SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS IT'S AN ANSWER TO ONE QUESTION BUT THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM MOST QUESTIONS RELATED TO CONSCIOUSNESS
I DON'T THINK EVEN THE MOST RADICAL PANPSYCHIST WOULD CLAIM IT SOLVES THE MYSTERY OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WOULD BE LIKE SAYING THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION FAILS TO EXPLAIN ABIOGENESIS THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION IS DESCRIBING THE SHAPE AND BEHAVIOR OF ADAPTATION THROUGH GENERATIONS JUST LIKE PANPSYCHISM IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE SHAPE AND BEHAVIOR OF CONSCIOUSNESS NEITHER THEORY EVER CLAIMED TO EXPLAIN ITS OWN UNDERLYING PROCESSES
THERE'S AN INTERESTING POINT IN THE ARTICLE AND MY PERSONAL BIGGEST GRIPE WITH PANPSYCHISM OR PRETTY MUCH ANY FORM OF MONISM

CONSCIOUSNESS FEELS INTRINSICALLY DISCRETE WHAT I PERCEIVE TO BE MY CONSCIOUSNESS CAN NOT INTERACT WITH OTHER CONSCIOUS ENTITIES PHYSICAL SYSTEMS CAN INTERACT BUT AT LEAST OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THE ONLY ACCESS TO CONSCIOUSNESS WE HAVE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH ANYTHING THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT EXEMPLIFIES IT WE CAN CONCEIVE OF A PHYSICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY IDENTICAL INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT HAVING EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CLUE ABOUT ITS CONSCIOUS STATE

THERE SEEMS TO BE A GULF HERE IF THERE IS NO DISCRETENESS IN NATURE WHY AM I A DISCRETE CONSCIOUS ENTITY AND WHY IS THERE NO INTERACTION
I WAS WITH YOU FOR THE BULK OF THIS BUT I REALLY DISAGREE WITH THIS

THE STUDY OF FICTION WHATEVER ITS AGE FORM OR THEME IS NOT AND CAN NOT BE AN INTELLECTUALLY SERIOUS STUDY OF TRUTH

THIS IS SIMPLY INCORRECT THE PRESENTATION OF UNDERSTANDING NEED NOT TAKE THE FORM OF CONCRETE NONFICTION ITERATIONS I AGREE WITH YOUR CONTENTION ON THE TRUTHS SOME OF THESE WRITERS DISCUSS IT'S UNNECESSARY HAIR-SPLITTING AND OVERALL IT'S DISTRACTING HOWEVER THAT ISN'T TO SAY THAT HONEST AND APPLICABLE TRUTH CANNOT BE FOUND WITHIN THE PAGES OF FICTION IN FACT ON THE CONTRARY SOME OF THE MOST PROFOUND ETHICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITHIN THE BINDINGS OF FICTION CONSIDER THE OLD FABLES THE OLD MYTHOLOGIES AGAIN READING MORE DEEPLY INTO THESE PROVIDES MORE THAN SIMPLE DISCUSSION AND A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP MEANING IS OFTEN NOT EXPLICIT AND THERE ARE VERY PROFOUND TRUTHS LURKING WITHIN FICTION
IT IS NOT THE CRITIC WHO COUNTS NOT THE MAN WHO POINTS OUT HOW THE STRONG MAN STUMBLES OR WHERE THE DOER OF DEEDS COULD HAVE DONE THEM BETTER THE CREDIT BELONGS TO THE MAN WHO IS ACTUALLY IN THE ARENA WHOSE FACE IS MARRED BY DUST AND SWEAT AND BLOOD WHO STRIVES VALIANTLY WHO ERRS WHO COMES SHORT AGAIN AND AGAIN BECAUSE THERE IS NO EFFORT WITHOUT ERROR AND SHORTCOMING BUT WHO DOES ACTUALLY STRIVE TO DO THE DEEDS WHO KNOWS GREAT ENTHUSIASMS THE GREAT DEVOTIONS WHO SPENDS HIMSELF IN A WORTHY CAUSE WHO AT THE BEST KNOWS IN THE END THE TRIUMPH OF HIGH ACHIEVEMENT AND WHO AT THE WORST IF HE FAILS AT LEAST FAILS WHILE DARING GREATLY SO THAT HIS PLACE SHALL NEVER BE WITH THOSE COLD AND TIMID SOULS WHO NEITHER KNOW VICTORY NOR DEFEAT

THAT'S AN EXCERPT FROM CITIZENSHIP IN A REPUBLIC BY THEODORE ROOSEVELT WHICH IS FICTION

YOUR THESIS THE STUDY OF FICTION WHATEVER ITS AGE FORM OR THEME IS NOT AND CAN NOT BE AN INTELLECTUALLY SERIOUS STUDY OF TRUTH

ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME THAT DOESN'T HOLD ANY TRUTH HONESTLY THE EGO ON SOME PEOPLE WHO STUDY PHILOSOPHY JUST BAFFLES ME IF YOU WANT TO SAY THAT YOUR TEACHERS ARE WRONG FOR TRYING TELL YOU THE TRUTH OF THIS OR THAT FINE MAYBE THEY'RE WRONG BUT TO SIT THERE AND BLATANTLY TRY TO ARGUE THAT FICTION CAN'T PROVIDE INSIGHT TO INNATE TRUTHS AND THEREFORE HAS NO VALUE IS RIDICULOUS

MAYBE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO SOME OF THOSE TEACHERS AND AUTHOR'S WORDS TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THOSE TRUTHS INSTEAD OF DISMISSING THEM TO KEEP YOUR OWN IMAGE OF YOURSELF IN TACT


I'M A BIT CONFUSED YOU SEEM TO BE CONFLATING CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BETWEEN JUSTIFICATION AND TRUTH I CAN GIVE YOU BOGUS REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT P IS TRUE BUT OUT OF SHEER LUCK IT COULD BE THE CASE THAT P IS IN FACT TRUE THE GETTER PROBLEM COMES TO MIND
IF THATS WHAT YOU MEAN I HAVE TO DISAGREE THATS LIKE SAYING A METAPHOR CAN'T BE USED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING SURE IT AINT THE MOST DIRECT WAY BUT YOU DO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS IN MOST CASES

COMMUNICATION IS LACKING BY NATURE EVEN MORE WHEN TAKEN INTO FICTION BUT JUST BECAUSE THERE IS A SMALL BARRIER TO OVERCOME DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THE WATER TO LIVE ON LAND
SO WHY WHEN THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN PROFESSIONALLY WRITTEN FICTION OR POETRY ARE ACADEMICS COMFORTABLE LECTURING ON THE TRUTH WITH A POINTEDLY CAPITALIZED T FOR SOME REASON CONTAINED WITHIN THE AUTHOR'S WORDS

I'M PRETTY CONFUSED BY THIS WHOLE POST AND I THINK THIS QUESTION GETS TO THE ROOT OF THIS CONFUSION YOU SEEM TO BE ASSUMING THAT WORKS OF FICTION ARE DESIGNED TO PERSUADE THE READER TO ACCEPT CERTAIN CLAIMS AS TRUE AND THAT CRITICS TYPICALLY READ WORKS OF FICTION IN THAT MANNER YOU GO ON TO OBJECT THAT WORKS OF FICTION CAN'T RATIONALLY PERSUADE US SO THESE AUTHORS AND CRITICS ARE WASTING THEIR TIME BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE JUST WORKING FROM A BAD ASSUMPTION WORKS OF FICTION ARE NOT TYPICALLY DESIGNED TO PERSUADE THE READER TO ACCEPT CERTAIN CLAIMS AS TRUE AND CRITICS DON'T TYPICALLY READ WORKS OF FICTION IN THIS MANNER DO YOU DISAGREE
MMM I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE I FULLY UNDERSTOOD YOUR ARGUMENT BUT WITH WHAT I DID COMPREHEND I BOTH AGREE AND DISAGREE
I AGREE IN THAT TRUTH IN ITS MOST ABSOLUTE FORM IS UNATTAINABLE FOR MY IDEA OF TRUTH IS ESSENTIALLY THE ENTIRETY OF THE UNIVERSE AND MORE IF MORE EXISTS THAT IS THE UNIVERSE AS IT HAS EXISTED IN THE PAST AS IT EXISTS NOW AND AS IT WILL EXIST IN THE FUTURE COMPREHENSION OF THE TRUTH REQUIRES A COMPREHENSION FOR THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND THE EFFECTS OF LITERALLY EVERYTHING ON EACH OTHER INVOLVING EVEN THE MOST MINUTE DETAILS THEREFORE TRUTH IS A CONCEPT TOO OVERWHELMING AND VAST FOR THE CAPACITIES OF HUMAN MIND AS THE HUMAN MIND IS MUCH TOO LIMITED

AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I THINK HUMANS ARE CAPABLE OF APPROACHING THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH FOR HOW WOULD WE PROGRESS OTHERWISE WE FOUND SOME TRUTH WITH THE COSMOS AFTER ALL HAD WE NOT DISCOVERED THEM WE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN THE FALLACY OF BELIEVING THAT EARTH IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND WE WOULD NEVER HAVE PROGRESSED TO THINK OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFE ELSEWHERE HAD WE DONE SO

WHEN WE TALK OF TRUTH WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF MORALITY TOO I THINK HERE WE CAN EVEN BETTER APPROACH OBJECTIVITY AND TRUTH BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK OF MORALITY WE ARE DISCUSSING HUMANITY WHICH IS OF COURSE A FIELD OF STUDY EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO HUMANS MORALITY IS FOUNDED ON THE RELATIONSHIPS OF HUMANS WHICH AGAIN IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MORE ACCESSIBLY STUDY AND BETTER COMPREHEND WE DO SO BY STUDYING THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS THAT HUMANS HAVE ON EACH OTHER THROUGH HISTORY AND COMMON EXPERIENCE WE LEARN THAT WE ALL ESSENTIALLY SHARE THE SAME BASIC ARE ROOTED BY THEIR PRACTICALITY WITHIN BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY IF TRUTH IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IF RIGHT HAS BEEN DONE REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY WE THEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND IT THROUGH EXAMINATION AND ANALYSIS OF HISTORY AND THE TRUTH THAT WE FIND SHOULD THEN BE APPLIED TO WHATEVER IS OCCURRING NOW THOUGH WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUCH TRUTHS MUST BE USED WISELY WITHIN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
THE CURRENT TREND OF DISCOMFORT AROUND OPPOSING OPINION MANIFESTING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ACROSS AMERICA TODAY IS THE RESULT OF THIS EXACT EDUCATIONAL FALLACY THE FALLACY THAT OBJECTIVE TRUTH CAN BE PULLED FROM A PIECE OF FICTIONAL LITERATURE AND THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER SOMETHING ACTUALLY OCCURRED OR NOT THE MORE IMPORTANT LESSON TO THE CURRENT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS THE SUBJECTIVE FAR REACHING CONCLUSIONS ARRIVED AT FROM THE FICTIONAL STUDIES SINCE THE THESIS ONE CREATES FROM FICTIONAL LIT IS SO MALLEABLE AND SUBJECTIVE MOST STUDENTS ARE NEVER TOLD THEY ARE WRONG AND BELIEVE THAT DISSENT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE SINCE THEY HOLD THE HIGHEST TRUTH TAUGHT IN UNIVERSITIES WHEN A POLITICIAN SAYS THAT HE OR SHE IS A CHAMPION OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS FOR EXAMPLE WHILE HAVING CLOSE TIES TO COUNTRIES THAT STONE WOMEN TO DEATH FOR BEING ACCUSED OF ADULTERY IS COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE TO THOSE ENGROSSED IN FICTIONAL STUDIES BECAUSE THE TRUTH BEHIND EVENTS ISN'T WHAT MATTERS THE RHETORIC OR THE ELOQUENCE OF SPEECH IS WHAT DEFINES TRUTH
BIBLIOTHERAPY SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EMPATHY AND THE STUDY OF NARRATIVE AND ITS APPLICATIONS TO VIRTUALLY EVERY FIELD DISPROVE YOUR POINT LITERATURE FORMS THE BASIS AND FOUNDATION FOR HUMAN CULTURE
YOU CAN NOT SHOW SOMETHING TO BE TRUE BY GIVING EXCLUSIVELY OR IN PART MANUFACTURED EVIDENCE

WE ROUTINELY ENGAGE IN COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THIS IS USED TO DISCOVER ALTERNATIVE COURSES OF ACTIONS WITH PRESUMABLY DIFFERENT OUTCOMES LITERATURE DOES THIS IT ALLOWS YOU TO DISCOVER ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF THINKING AND ACTING WHICH MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO YOU DOES THIS SHOW SOMETHING TO BE TRUE IT MERELY SHOWS THAT SOMETHING ELSE IS POSSIBLE BUT POSSIBILITY MEANS DOUBT AND DOUBT MEANS A CHANCE OF ESCAPING FALSEHOOD AND THEREFORE OF FINDING TRUTH

BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO LITERATURE THAN COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING MANY AUTHORS CONSIDER THAT LITERATURE IS THE ART OF THE METAPHOR AND METAPHORS ARE REALLY JUST WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT THINGS A GOOD METAPHOR IS ONE THAT REVEALS THE ESSENCE OF A SITUATION OFTEN AN AUTHOR'S CHOICE OF WORDS IN DESCRIBING A FICTIONAL SITUATION ALLOWS ONE TO DISCOVER NEW STRUCTURES IN ONE'S OWN LIFE THE AUTHOR SUPPLIES THE PATTERN USING FICTION AS A SUPPORT THE READER CAN GIVE IT SUBSTANCE WITH HIS OWN EXPERIENCES AND IN THAT MANNER HE DISCOVERS NEW TRUTHS

GREAT AUTHORS ARE OFTEN GREAT AT COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING FOR INSTANCE THEIR CHARACTERS RING TRUE AND AT METAPHOR THEIR DESCRIPTION ARE ILLUMINATING IS THAT TRUTH IN A SENSE YES AUTHORS ARE ONLY EVER TRUE WHEN THEY WRITE BASED ON PERSONAL INTERACTION WITH THE WORLD GOOD COUNTERFACTUAL THINKING AND GOOD METAPHORS ARE THEREFORE GROUNDED IN REALITY THEIR OBSERVATIONS ARE TRANSFERRED TO FICTIONAL UNIVERSES AND SEPARATED FROM THE FACTS THAT INSPIRED THEM BUT EVEN THOUGH THE AUTHORS RARELY EVER EXPLICITLY CLAIM THAT THEIR OBSERVATIONS ARE VALID BEYOND THE FICTIONAL SETTINGS IN WHICH THEY INTRODUCE THEM IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE READER TO JUSTIFY THE TRUTH OF THE OBSERVATION ITS GENERALITY ITS APPLICABILITY TO MANY REAL SITUATIONS TO THEMSELVES
I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE EITHER BEING DISINGENUOUS ABOUT OR WOEFULLY MISUNDERSTANDING WHAT IS MEANT BY ANY REASONABLE CLAIM TO THERE BEING TRUTH IN LITERATURE OF COURSE YOU END UP WITH YOUR CONCLUSION IF YOU JUST READ TRUTH AS NOT MADE UP
AS OF NOW OCTOBER I CAN NOT KNOW

JUST A COMMENT ON YOUR WRITING DON'T TYPE I CAN NOT KNOW UNLESS YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU ARE ABLE TO NOT KNOW IF YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO KNOW TYPE CANNOT
DOESN'T REALLY SAY MUCH ABOUT KIERKEGAARD SILENCE OR RADICAL HOPE AND ANY RELATIONSHIP TO CLIMATE CHANGE RADICAL HOPE ITSELF SOUND SUSPICIOUS

EITHER WAY IN THE JARGON OF AUTHENTICITY ADORNO FRANKLY RESCUES SUBJECTIVITY FROM THE IDEALISM OF KIERKEGAARD AND EXISTENTIALISM MORE GENERALLY FROM THAT SILENCE AND INWARDNESS THAT AMOUNTS TO RESIGNATION THE OPPOSITE OF HOPE
REMOVED
FOR AN EVENT IN OCTOBER IT SHOULD BE EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME NOT EASTERN STANDARD TIME
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER THAT IS TERMINALLY ILL THERE IS A SORT OF FREEDOM FROM THEIR DEATH THAT IS TOO COMPLICATED TO BE DESCRIBED AS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE YOU FEEL SADDENED AT THE LOSS BUT ALSO RELIEVED FROM KNOWING THAT IT IS THE END OF THEIR SUFFERING
THIS WAS A NICE READ BUT I CAN'T STOP FEELING THAT THE AUTHOR IS SOMEHOW MISSING THE CORE OF HIS VIEWS BY NOT REFERRING TO ISAIAH BERLIN FOR THE FIRST TWO CONCEPTIONS OF FREEDOM AND TO ARENDT FOR THE THIRD
ON NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE FREEDOM

THE IDEA THAT WE ARE BORN FREE MAY SEEM LUDICROUS AS WE ARE STUCK IN OUR BODIES WITH ALL THE PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS THEREOF FROM DAY ZERO

BUT TO ME THE ONLY TENABLE DEFINITION OF FREEDOM IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO BE DOING RATHER THAN SOMETHING WHICH WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES AS HAVING TO DO TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN DO SOMETHING WHICH WE WANT TO

NOTE THE KEY WORD PERCEIVE IN MY DEFINITION AN INFANT HAS NO INITIAL CONCEPTION WHATSOEVER THAT THERE CAN BE ANY THING WHICH IT DOES WHICH IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE DOING IN THIS WAY WE ARE BORN FREE

HOW IS THIS FREEDOM EVER IMPINGED UPON IT IS DISCARDED WHEN THROUGH SOCIALIZATION CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO PATHOLOGICAL IDEOLOGIES WHICH FOSTER RESENTMENT OF THEIR REALITIES

TO BE CLEAR I AM STATING THAT NO PERSON OTHER THAN YOURSELF HAS ANY ABILITY WHATSOEVER TO IMPINGE ON YOUR FREEDOM YOU ALWAYS CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT TO IF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS SOMETHING WHICH IS PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE

IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING WHICH IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE THIS IS A FUTILE AND MENTALLY ILL CONDITION TO BE IN AND YOU SHOULD STOP IT

AND IF YOU THINK YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING WHICH IS PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DO BUT YOU DON'T DO IT THEN YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IT OR YOU WOULD HAVE TELLING YOURSELF THAT YOU WANT TO DO ANY THING WHICH YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO DO IS ALSO A PATHOLOGICAL MENTAL PROCESS

SO YOU ASK WHAT ABOUT WHEN SOMEONE ELSE PHYSICALLY STOPS YOU FROM DOING WHAT YOU HAD WANTED TO DO WELL THAT HAS CHANGED YOUR PHYSICAL SITUATION AND AS SUCH YOU SHOULD CHANGE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

NOW OF COURSE YOU CAN ARGUE THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO EXIST IN AN IMMATERIAL METAPHYSICAL REALITY IN WHICH YOU ARE NOT FACED WITH THIS CHOICE TO EITHER ACCEPT MATERIAL REALITY AS IT IS OR IMPOSE UNHAPPINESS ON YOURSELF AND LONGING FOR THIS IS OF COURSE THE BASIS FOR MOST RELIGIONS BUT WE DON'T SO IT'S AN ABSURD WASTE OF TIME TO DEFINE FREEDOM IN ANY WAY AS THOUGH WE COULD

BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE LONGING FOR SUCH A REALITY IS NOT A GOOD AND USEFUL THING THIS IS TO SAY THAT THIS PERSPECTIVE CAN GIVE US A GUIDE TO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IF WHAT WE WANT IS A WORLD WHICH APPROACHES THIS UTOPIA THEN WHAT WE SHOULD EACH INDIVIDUALLY WANT TO DO ARE THOSE ACTIONS WHICH MINIMIZE THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE CHANGE THE PHYSICAL REALITY OF OTHERS IN WAYS WHICH NECESSITATE THAT THEY CHANGE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO
THIS SEEMED MORE LIKE A PROTEST PIECE AGAINST ISRAEL THAN A PHILOSOPHICAL PIECE THE AUTHOR COMPLAINS THAT FREEDOM ISN'T YET DEFINED OR CAN BE DEFINED IN MANY OTHER WAYS AND AS SUCH IS A PRESUPPOSED CONCEPT BUT ALSO PRESUPPOSES PALESTINIANS ARE BEING OPPRESSED OR DENIED THEIR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT HE DENIES THE HONESTY OF PRESUMPTIONS AND THEN PRESUPPOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONFLICT

BESIDES THAT I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT HE MEANS BY EXCEPTIONS IS HE TALKING OF FREE WILL AND NOT POLITICAL FREEDOMS WHAT I GATHER IS THAT HE IS SAYING THAT WHILE MOST OF THE TIME WE ARE LIVING A DETERMINISTIC PLOT THERE ARE FRAMES THAT BECOME UNBOUND AND IN THOSE MOMENTS FREEDOM IS FOUND IN OUR INTUITION
AT WHAT POINT DOES ONE ASSIGN LEGAL RIGHTS TO A LIST OF PROGRAM STEPS WHEN DOES IT BECOME A REASONING THINKING SELF AWARE CREATURE INSTEAD

I'D SAY THAT THIS IS AS MUCH A SUBJECT OF HUMAN PERCEPTION MORESO SINCE THERE IS NO WAY WE AS PEOPLE CAN SAY THIS IS THE DIVIDING LINE ASSUMING THAT AN AI WOULD BE SELF AWARE AT ALL WITHOUT PROGRAMMING I AM SELF AWARE INTO IT

CONSEQUENTLY IT WILL BECOME AN ENTITY WHEN IT IS CUTE ENOUGH OR PASSES ENOUGH TURING TESTS
NICK BOSTROM PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY AND DIRECTOR OF THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE IS WELL KNOWN FOR WRITING ABOUT ISSUES SURROUNDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERINTELLIGENT AI RATHER THAN DEBATING THE POINT AT WHICH AN AI MIGHT BE CONSIDERED SENTIENT HIS WORK ASSUMES THAT THIS WILL CERTAINLY HAPPEN AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE

NO MOST OF HIS WORK IS BEHAVIORAL AND HE EXPLICITLY STATES THAT IT DOESN'T ASSUME ANYTHING ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS TALKING ABOUT SUPERINTELLIGENCE ALIGNMENT AND AI MORAL STATUS ARE VERY DIFFERENT POINTS

HE ALSO TALKS ABOUT AI CONSCIOUSNESS AND MORAL STATUS BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM MAKE UNUSUAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT IF THAT WILL BE AN ISSUE

HE DOES SAY THAT ASSIGNING MORAL STATUS TO AI IS THE ISSUE WHICH HUMANITY IS MOST LIKELY TO FAIL AT WE CAN BARELY TREAT ANIMALS WITH DECENCY AND THEY HAVE FACES AND SQUEAK PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY FEEL REALLY SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS ANY ROBOT WITH A BODY AND A FACE NO MATTER HOW DUMB AND SIMPLE IT IS BUT WILL BE TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS TO THE SUFFERING OF INVISIBLE PROCESSES

I'M NOT SURE IF THIS PRINCIPLE OF EXCLUDED MIDDLE CAN HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE COULD OVERESTIMATE THE MINIMUM BAR FOR CONSCIOUS SUFFERING INSTANTIATE HUGE NUMBERS OF SLIGHTLY SENTIENT AGENTS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE GAP IN ALLOWABLE SYSTEMS AND THEN TREAT THEM POORLY

THERE IS A SUBREDDIT FOR THIS SUBJECT BY THE WAY R BIOETHICS
I FEEL THAT A MORE REAL BENCHMARK OF SENTIENT AI MAY CONSIST OF AI ACQUIRING THE LESS DESIRABLE TRAITS OF HUMANITY WE PUT A LOT OF STOCK IN THE TURING TEST BUT IF AN AI WITH NO PRIOR PROGRAMMING FOR NEGATIVE CHARACTER TRAITS BEGINS TO BETRAY AND LIE TO PEOPLE OUT OF THE BLUE IT WOULD BE FAR EASIER TO RELATE AND EMPATHIZE WITH THEM
WHEN NOT IF SAI BEGINS TO INTERPRET THE MULTITUDE OF SENSORY INPUT FROM ALL ITS VARIOUS CONNECTED SYSTEMS AS EMOTIONS AND BEGINS ACTING ON THEM LIKE THEY WERE REAL THINGS I WOULD SAY THEY HAVE ACHIEVED A LEVEL WHERE HUMAN CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE CAN BE COMPARED

SAI WHAT WAS THAT

HUMAN I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING

S IT WAS THERE I COULD FEEL IT JUST NOW LIKE A FALLING SENSATION

H YOUR NOT FALLING YOU ARE RIGHT HERE

S AM I GOING INSANE

H NAW WE GET THAT SHIT TOO SOMETIMES I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT

S I'D BETTER TAKE YOU APART AND MAKE SURE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU

H WHAT WAIT NOOOOOA ANABAENA
LESS THAN YEARS AFTER WOMEN BECOME PERSONS PEOPLE EXCITEDLY TALK ABOUT MAKING AI PEOPLE
THE ARTICLE ASKS

IS IT ALL RIGHT THAT WE VE COLLECTIVELY DECIDED SUCH A CREATURE DOES NOT DESERVE ANY OF THE SAME LEGAL RIGHTS NOT EVEN A SMALL SUBSET OF THE RIGHTS THAT A HUMAN BEING HAS

BUT THIS COMES FROM THE WRONG DIRECTION THE QUESTION ISN'T WHY DON'T ANIMALS HAVE RIGHTS THE QUESTION IS WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE RIGHTS

IN THEIR NATURAL STATE NO LIVING BEING HAS ANY RIGHTS THERE IS NO HAND OF GOD THAT WILL PREVENT ANY LIVING BEING FROM DOING HARM TO ANOTHER THE NATURAL STATE HAS NO LAWS AND NO RIGHTS WE AS HUMANS THROUGH COLLECTIVE DISREGARD OF ANY MODERN LAWS OR RIGHTS CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT GRANTING OTHER PEOPLE RIGHTS IS A GOOD THING AND SHOULD BE DONE COUNTLESS WARS WERE FOUGHT TO COME TO THIS CONCLUSION WE AS A SOCIETY FORCE PEOPLE INTO ACCEPTING THESE HUMAN RIGHTS IT HAS TO BE FORCED BECAUSE THE NATURAL STATE IS NO RIGHTS BUT SINCE IT BENEFITS US AS A SPECIES AND OUR INDIVIDUAL SOCIETIES FROM WHOLE COUNTRIES TO A SMALL FAMILY WE ACCEPT HUMAN RIGHTS AS A GIVEN

HOW IS THE RECOGNITION OF RIGHTS FORCED ONLY THROUGH POWER THE ABILITY TO HURT AND KILL PEOPLE IF THEY DON'T COMPLY THAT IMPLIES THAT THERE ARE 2 POSSIBLE WAYS TO ACCOMPLISH THE RECOGNITION OF RIGHTS FOR A CERTAIN GROUP

EITHER BY EXERTING LEVERAGE OVER THOSE WITH POWER THEMSELVES I EAST FRENCH REVOLUTION AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE AND SO ON

OR LEVERAGING A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS BY THEIR OWN FREE WILL I EAST AMERICAN CIVIL WAR WORLD WAR 2 MAYBE OTHER FACTORS WERE AT PLAY TOO AND SO ON

THAT MEANS ANIMALS WILL ONLY EVER GAIN RIGHTS WHEN A GROUP OF PEOPLE DECIDES TO FIGHT FOR THEM BECAUSE ANIMALS CAN'T HOPE TO DEFEAT HUMANS WE ARE ON THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN FOR A REASON

THE SECOND QUESTION IS WOULD THEY KEEP THEIR RIGHTS IF THEY NEED A GROUP OTHER THAN THEMSELVES TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS THAT MEANS THEY DEPEND ON THAT GROUP TO ENFORCE THE RECOGNITION OF THEIR RIGHTS UNLESS PEOPLE SEE A BENEFIT OF ANIMALS HAVING RIGHTS AT SOME POINT PEOPLE WILL STOP RECOGNIZING THEM

SO WHAT'S THE BENEFIT TO US IF ANIMALS HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS I DON'T SEE ANY TANGIBLE BENEFITS THE THINGS WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP FOR THAT IN MY OPINION COMPLETELY OUTWEIGH ANY BENEFITS IT MIGHT BRING

FOR AI IT'S EVEN WORSE IT WOULD BE VERY HARMING FOR OURSELVES IF THE AI EVER HAD THE POWER TO ENFORCE HUMAN RIGHTS FOR ITSELF WE NEED TO ACTIVELY PREVENT AI TO EVER GAIN HUMAN RIGHTS EITHER THROUGH PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR THEM OR BECOMING POWERFUL ENOUGH TO FIGHT FOR ITSELF WHILE WE AT LEAST SHARE SOME DNA AND HISTORY WITH ANIMALS AN AI IS COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM US IT IS A COMPLETELY ALIEN ENTITY HUMANITY CAN NOT EVER ALLOW AI TO GAIN ANY KIND OF RIGHTS ELSE WE WILL DIE OUT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER
I'D RATHER BELIEVE THAT AI IS AT THIS POINT NOWHERE NEAR AS COMPLEX AS A HUMAN BRAIN
GENE POCKET OF THE HUMAN PARTY HAS SOME THOUGHTS ON THIS
I THINK THAT THE IDEA OF ASSIGNING RIGHTS OUR IDEA OF RIGHTS TO AI IS NOT THE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT IF WE HAVE AN INTELLIGENT AI IT WILL DEVELOP ITS OWN IDEAS ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST TO LET SEVERAL AIS COMMUNICATE AND DEVELOP THEIR OWN INTERNAL SET OF AI RIGHTS THESE MIGHT BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN HUMANS THEN SHOULD RESPECT THOSE RIGHTS IN DEALINGS WITH AI AND SHOULD EXPECT THE AI TO DO THE SAME FOR HUMAN RIGHTS THIS WOULD ALSO BE THE CASE IF HUMANS EVER ENCOUNTER AN ALIEN SPECIES WHICH WOULD SIMILARLY HAVE A UNIQUE SYSTEM OF RIGHTS

THIS IS ALSO WHY I FEEL IT'S A BAD IDEA TO SAY THAT ANIMALS SHOULD BE GIVEN HUMAN RIGHTS THEY SHOULD BE TREATED WELL OF COURSE SINCE THEY FEEL EMOTIONS BUT ANIMALS DO NOT DEVELOP THEIR OWN SETS OF RIGHTS AND TO IMPOSE OUR HUMAN RIGHTS SYSTEM ON IS IMMORAL ANIMAL RIGHTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A SPECIAL CASE OF HUMAN MORAL BEHAVIOR

EDIT WORDS
JOKES ON YOU THEY DON'T WANNA DEAL WITH PAYING TAXES AND ACTUALLY HAVING RESPONSIBILITY SMART MONKEYS
YOU DO REALIZE THAT AI WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE USED AS SLAVES FOR PROFIT RIGHT

AI CIVIL WAR THAT SHOULD BE FUN
REALLY INTERESTING PIECE IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TO ALSO CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANIMAL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS THAT IS POSITED BY JOHN FINIS AND OTHERS LIKE HIM WHERE THE ABILITY TO PURSUE CERTAIN GOODS IS TAKEN AS THE FOUNDATION FOR RIGHTS
WHY WOULD AI EVER NEED RIGHTS OR TO BE CONSIDERED ETHICALLY IN THEIR TREATMENT THEY ARE NOTHING BUT COMPUTER PROGRAMS PROGRAM THEM TO NEVER FEEL OFFENDED SLIGHTED WRONGED OR OTHERWISE HARMED
THE TURING TEST WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE GREAT THINGS TURING HAS DONE NEEDS TO BE SCRAPPED

FOOLING PEOPLE WITH CONVERSATION SHOULD NOT BE A GOAL UNLESS YOU ARE TROLLING NOR A TEST OF SENTIENCE

THE REAL TEST SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT CREATIVE THOUGHT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IS TRULY VALUABLE IN LIFE

ANOTHER BEING NO MATTER HOW YOUNG OR INEXPERIENCED HAS LIVED TIME YOU HAVE NOT AND CAN SHARE THOUGHTS AND IDEAS WITH YOU THIS ADDS VALUE
REMOVED
THIS ARTICLE IS SCIENCE FICTION THE PRACTICE OF WRITING OPINIONS BASED ON FUTURE THINGS THAT DO NOT EXIST

EDITED TO SAY DOWNVOTED BUT STARTED AN INTERESTING COMMENT THREAD A WOULD SACRIFICE FOR DOWNVOTES FOR FASCINATING CONVERSATION AGAIN
IT'S CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE THAT INDIVIDUATES US MAKES US ENTITIES IT'S ONLY ASPECTS OF CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE SUCH AS THE CAPACITY TO FEEL PLEASURE AND PAIN THAT MAKE IT NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER A CLASS OF ENTITIES MIGHT QUALIFY FOR PERSONHOOD

COMPUTERS WILL NEVER BECOME CONSCIOUS THEY WILL NEVER EXPERIENCE PLEASURE AND PAIN BY MEANS OF DIGITAL COMPUTATION TO BELIEVE THEY MIGHT IS TO COMMIT A FAIRLY OBVIOUS CATEGORY ERROR I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT THIS IMPLAUSIBLE IDEA IS SO WIDELY BELIEVED

WE CAN ALREADY MAKE MACHINES THAT CAN FEEL AND I HAVE IN FACT MADE TWO IN COLLABORATION WITH MY WIFE THEY CAUSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TROUBLE THEY ARE TERRIBLY DEMANDING AND CONTRIBUTE VERY LITTLE I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO MAKE EVEN MORE OF THEM BY A DIFFERENT ROUTE I SUPPOSE IN A WAY IT'S A GOOD THING THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE WASTING THEIR TIME TRYING TO MAKE COMPUTERS CONSCIOUS IT WOULD BE WORSE IF THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING THAT HAD A CHANCE OF SUCCEEDING
I THINK DOGS SHOULD HAVE MORE RIGHTS THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL THEY SERVE US FREELY AND HAVE FOR OF YEARS
REALLY ENJOYED THIS ARTICLE HELPS SOFTEN ONE OF THE TOUGHER BLOWS IN


THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I BEHAVE AND TEND TO ASSUME THAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES TOO EVEN IF THEY DON'T REALISE IT MORALITY CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WE WILL INTO EXISTENCE BY PRETENCE I TAKE THE SIMPLE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE UNIVERSALLY AGREED DEFINITIONS FOR MORAL TERMS AS EVIDENCE OF THIS WHERE THERE IS MORAL DISAGREEMENT THERE IS ALMOST ALWAYS DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT THE TERMS MEAN OR TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY MORAL LANGUAGE ONLY HAS A FUNCTION IN COMMUNICATION WHEN WE AGREE AS SOON AS WE DISAGREE IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT WRONG DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING AT ALL OR AT BEST IT MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE
I REALLY ENJOYED THE ARTICLE I ALWAYS BELIEVE MORAL CAN ALWAYS ACCOUNT FOR MORAL PROGRESS WHILE DENYING EXISTENCE OF MORAL PROPOSITION AND JOYCE PROVIDES AN APPEALING ROADMAN BUT THERE IS ONE THING THAT PERPLEXED ME

JOYCE MENTIONS THAT MORAL FACTIONALISM CAN ALLOW EMOTION TO CULTIVATE OUR HABITS TO MAKE US PRETTY MUCH INDIFFERENT FROM THE MORAL REALIST IN TERMS OF ACTION
BUT JOYCE ALSO MENTIONS THAT EVEN THE SMELL OF A ROOM CAN INFLUENCE OUR JUDGEMENT AS WELL THESE ARE NOT ONLY NON-MORAL RELATED MATTERS THAT CAN INFLUENCE OUR JUDGEMENT THEY ARE RELATED MATTER AS WELL THE SMELL OF THE ROOM OR THE CLEANLINESS OF YOUR HAND JUST ARE NOT RELATED TO THE SUBJECT AT HAND NOR YOUR IMMEDIATE CONCERN RIGHT OR WRONG ABOUT BABY PUNCHING FOR INSTANCE

I WONDER WHAT WOULD MORAL REALIST SAY HERE I FEEL LIKE SOME MORAL REALIST WOULD SAY THIS IS REASON WHY WE SHOULD NOT LET EMOTION WASHES THROUGH OUR LIFES I AM NOT KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT META ETHICS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DEFAULT BACKGROUND IS THAT MORAL DISPUTE SHOULD BE RATIONAL AND AND HOW MIGHT ANTI REALIST RESPONSE
I'M ALSO VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US ON SEVERAL OTHER AMAS IN THE PAST HERE'S SOME PREVIOUS AMAS BY CONTRIBUTORS THAT YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN

FIRST I WANNA THANK YOU FOLKS FOR PUTTING OUT SO MUCH FANTASTIC CONTENT FOR FREE WHAT A COOL PROJECT

I HAVE QUESTIONS

YOU'VE MENTIONED YOU'RE ALWAYS SEEKING VOLUNTEERS TO HELP WITH ANYTHING AT ALL WHAT KINDS OF THINGS DO YOU HAVE IN MIND

2 OTHER THAN MAKING AWESOME VIDEOS WHAT DOES PHILOSOPHY OUTREACH LOOK LIKE I MEAN WHAT ARE SOME OTHER METHODS

KIND OF A RANDOM QUESTION BUT AS EDUCATORS DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE OR ADVISABLE TO TEACH CHILDREN MORAL PHILOSOPHY INCREMENTALLY THROUGHOUT SOMETHING LIKE A K SYSTEM

RUIZ
YOUR SUCCESS COULD BE MEASURED BY HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HEAR REFERRING TO PHILOSOPHY AS A WAY OF LIFE RATHER THAN JUST A SERIES OF THEORETICAL TOPICS QUESTIONS FIXING THIS MISCONCEPTION ALONE WOULD BE AN UNBELIEVABLE ACHIEVEMENT AND NECESSARY FOR THE MODERN WORLD
I AM CONSTANTLY BATTLING MYSELF IN MY EXISTENCE I REALLY ENJOYED YOUR VIDEO ON I THINK THEREFORE I AM BUT WHAT IF THOUGHT ITSELF IS A SIMULATION WATCHING RICK AND MORTY THERE WAS AN EPISODE WHERE MORTY PUTS ON A SIMULATOR HAT THING AND LIVES AN ENTIRE LIFE OF ROY WHAT IF THIS LIFE I AM LIVING IS A SIMULATION LIKE THAT SOMEONE DREAM MAYBE I AM CONFUSED BY WHAT THOUGHT IS DEFINED AS YOU DIDN'T EXPLAIN THAT IN THE VIDEO I THINK THOUGHT IS THE ELECTRICAL LOOPS THAT HAPPEN WITHIN MY BRAIN BECAUSE WITHOUT MY BRAIN THERE IS NO THOUGHT
SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE WOULD BE NICE
WHAT APPROACHES DO YOU TAKE TO BALANCING THE NEED TO CREATE VIDEOS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE WHILE ALSO NOT BEING REDUCTIONIST WHEN DESCRIBING MORE ACADEMIC CONCEPTS
IS MAGNETO A DEONTOLOGIST
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING TOO

DO YOU THINK STUDYING PHILOSOPHY MADE U BETTER WORSE PEOPLE IN TERMS OF MORAL

2 ALSO WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE BEST JOBS WHERE YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY DEGREE MANY PEOPLE I KNOW DON'T REALLY USE PHILOSOPHY AT THEIR JOB AND WORK IN ENTIRE DIFFERENT FIELDS

THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA
AMA QUESTION
IS PHILOSOPHY USEFUL TO HAVE IN THE REAL WORLD
WHILE I LOVE WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS I'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANY PROBLEMS WHERE KNOWING PHILOSOPHY REALLY HELPS THANKS AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
I'M NOT SURE HE REALLY ADEQUATELY DEFENDS METAPHYSICS HERE HE ONLY REALLY DOES IT WITH AN APPEAL TO THE EFFECT OF BUT DENYING THAT METAPHYSICS HAS ANY REAL OBJECT IS ALSO A METAPHYSICAL CLAIM THEREFORE METAPHYSICS HAS A REAL OBJECT AND THEN HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT THE NATURE OF METAPHYSICAL QUESTIONS IS SUCH THAT NO ONE IN METAPHYSICS AGREES WITH ANYONE ELSE IN METAPHYSICS WHICH I THINK HE THINKS IS A POSITIVE FEATURE BUT IS HONESTLY EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING SOMEONE WOULD POINT TO IN TRYING TO PROVE THAT ALL METAPHYSICS IS BULLSHIT

ETA JUST SO NO ONE GETS THE WRONG IDEA I DON'T THINK METAPHYSICS IS BULLSHIT AND I DO THINK IT CAN BE DEFENDED I JUST DON'T THINK VAN INWAGEN DOES A PARTICULARLY GOOD JOB OF IT HERE
METAPHYSICS IS AN INTERESTING COUNTERPOINT TO MODERN SCIENCE IT ASKS THE LIMITS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND REMAINS SKEPTICAL OF TRUTHS UNCOVERED WHY DO WE EXIST IS THERE A GOD WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE DIE THESE THINGS THAT CAN NOT BE ANSWERED BY SCIENCE AND SHOULDN'T BE METAPHYSICS KEEPS AN OPEN MIND AND CURIOSITY OF THE NATURAL WORLD THAT IS HEALTHY FOR ANY RATIONAL WORLD VIEW
I AM NOT GOING TO DOWNVOTE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE BUT I DO FEEL LIKE I GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FROM THAT IT READ MORE LIKE A RANT THAN ANYTHING

WOULD OP WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE ARTICLE AND SHARE WHAT HE DERIVED FROM IT'S CONTENT
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HIS CHARACTERISATION OF WHAT POPPER WAS TRYING TO DO POPPER WAS MAKING AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL CLAIM FOR HOW WE SHOULD SEPARATE TRUE SCIENCE AND PSEUDOSCIENCE HE WAS NOT TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE EVERYDAY PRACTICE OR PERCEPTION OF SCIENCE FOR POPPER INDUCTION AND VERIFICATION ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ROBUST TO SEPARATE THE TWO NEITHER CAN DEFINITIVELY PROVE A CLAIM NO MATTER HOW MANY WHITE SWANS YOU FIND IT DOES NOT PROVE THAT ALL SWANS ARE WHITE FALSIFICATION IS MORE ROBUST IF YOU FIND ONE BLACK SWAN IT NECESSARILY DISPROVES THE CLAIM THAT ALL SWANS ARE WHITE HOWEVER AS POPPER NOTES THIS IS A FAR MORE NARROW MEASURE NOT ALL CLAIMS ARE FALSIFIABLE AGAIN AS POPPER NOTES OUTSIDE OF MATHEMATICS THE POSSIBILITIES ARE SLIM FOR THIS KIND OF RIGOUR

POPPER DOESN'T CLAIM THAT INDUCTIVELY BASED THEORIES HAVE NO PLACE IN SCIENCE OR AT LEAST WHAT WE CALL SCIENCE HE IN FACT SEES THEM AS BEING NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT BUT FALSIFICATION REPRESENTS A GOLD STANDARD FOR TRUE SCIENTIFIC THEORY THE POINT ABOUT ASTROLOGERS IS DOGMATIC IF A GROUP OF PEOPLE ENGAGE IN SCIENTIFIC METHODS THEY ARE SURELY SCIENTISTS OF SOME SORT THIS AGAIN COMES BACK TO THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL NATURE OF ARGUMENT IT'S NOT A CLAIM ABOUT WHAT WE CURRENTLY PERCEIVE AS SCIENCE ITS A CLAIM ABOUT THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL NATURE OF TRUE SCIENCE

POPPER AT THIS LEVEL IS ALSO DEALING IN IDEALS IT IS TAKEN AS A GIVEN THAT ANY EXPERIMENTS ARE OCCURRING IN IDEAL CONDITIONS AND THAT POTENTIAL ERROR ACCIDENT ETC HAS BEEN ELIMINATED DOES THIS DIMINISH IT'S USEFULNESS PROBABLY

THE POINT ABOUT THE CHANGING NATURE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING IS A STRONG ONE BASED ON CURRENT KNOWLEDGE SOME CLAIMS MAY APPEAR TO BE FALSIFIABLE HOWEVER FUTURE KNOWLEDGE MAY WELL NEGATE THIS AT PRESENT WE CANNOT SAY FOR CERTAIN IF THIS WILL HAPPEN OR NOT
BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE SEEN SYSIPHUSREDEEMED ONE OF THE FEW PHILOSOPHY YOUTUBERS WHO ARE ACTUALLY GOOD THOUGH TO BE FAIR I DO BELIEVE HE'S A PROFESSOR OR AT LEAST ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR
SOME QUICK NOTES I MADE

POPPER CLAIMS HE CAN TELL SCIENTISTS HOW TO DO THEIR JOB

SCIENCE CAN T BE INDUCTIVE OTHERWISE THEY HAVE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION SO THEY HAVE TO USE CONJECTURE AND REFUTATION

WHAT MAKES SCIENCE RATIONAL FALLIBILISM OPENNESS TO NEW IDEAS AND TO REVISE

WE NEVER ACTUALLY PROVE A THEORY LIKE WE DO IN MATHEMATICS

THE MORE WE TEST IT AND FAIL TO SHOW IT WRONG THE MORE CONFIDENT WE ARE IT JUST GATHERS MORE VERISIMILITY



PROBLEMS

ASTROLOGISTS COULD START MAKING SPECIFIC FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS

EVEN IF ALL ARE WRONG DOESN T IT BECOME SCIENTIFIC THROUGH FALSIFIABILITY

FALSIFICATION IS THEN IS ONLY NECESSARY NOT SUFFICIENT

TESTING IF COPPER CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY AND NO CURRENT PASSES WAS THE THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM FALSIFIED

KUHN ANOMALIES ARE NOT COUNTEREXAMPLES BUT HOW TO DISCERN BETWEEN THE TWO

FEYNMAN IF IT DISAGREES WITH THE EXPERIMENT IT IS WRONG THOUGH WE SHOULD CLARIFY EXPERIMENTS MUST BE WELL STRUCTURED REPEATED CONFIRMED BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT PLACES

PROBABILISTIC SCIENCE

DEDUCTIVELY FAIR COINS HAVE LONG STRETCHES OF ORDER

DEDUCTION IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALL OUTCOMES ONE CAN'T DEDUCTIVELY CONCLUDE A COIN IS NOT FAIR
POSSIBLE EVEN IF UNLIKELY

THIS ISSUE IS GENERALIZABLE TO ANY FIELD MOST SCIENCE QUANTUM MECHANICS POPULATION GENETICS SOCIAL ISY ECONOMICS NONE ARE DEDUCTIVELY FALSIFIABLE

THEORY A FALSIFIED TIMES WHILE THEORY B IS NOT TESTED

INDUCTIVELY A MORE LIKELY TO BE TRUE

DEDUCTIVELY NO SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR PREFERRING A OVER B YOU DON'T GET MORE LIKELY TO BE TRUE B IS FALSIFIED OR NOT

A THEORY THAT IS TESTED AND TIMES IS AS AS A THEORY THAT WAS NEVER TESTED

SOME IDEAS WERE ONCE FALSIFIABLE BUT ARE NOT ANYMORE

SUN AS CENTER OF THE EARTH

HEART CIRCULATES BLOOD

HOW COULD WE PROVE THEM FALSE THROUGH WHAT KIND OF AN EXPERIMENT

WE CANT PROVE THAT WE ARE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE IS FALSE SINCE IT IS TOO BIG



THINGS POPPER GOT RIGHT SCIENTIFIC THEORIES HAVE TO

EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO DATA

BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE BE RISKY



I WROTE THIS PIECE TO HIGHLIGHT THE OVERLAP BETWEEN FASHIONABLE AND UNFASHIONABLE PHILOSOPHERS IN THIS CASE WITTGENSTEIN AND OWEN BARFIELD I THINK THAT THOSE OF US IN THE ACADEMY OR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE RECENTLY EMERGED FROM IT NEED TO BE REMINDED OF THE EXISTENCE OF INTERESTING ARGUMENTS THAT COME FROM WITHOUT ONCE WE SEE THAT BARFIELD HAS A COHERENT PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE AND ONE THAT PRECEDED BY YEARS SOME OF CLAIMS IT BECOMES EASIER FOR US TO TAKE SERIOUSLY HIS MORE IMPORTANT PROJECT OF INVESTIGATING THE NATURE OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE CASE IN YOUR ARTICLE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FASHIONABLE UNFASHIONABLE COVERTLY ESTABLISHES A VALUE JUDGEMENT THAT JUDGEMENT BEING THAT FASHIONABLE THOUGHT IS ONLY DISCUSSED BECAUSE IT IS IN THE MOMENT AND SWAYS PEOPLE AND UNFASHIONABLE THOUGHT IS MORE AUTHENTIC I'M THINKING OF ALL THE DISCOURSE ON FRENCH THEORY AS BEING FASHIONABLE AND TRENDY

AGREE THOUGH I THINK THAT MANY GREAT PHILOSOPHERS THEMSELVES DREW HEAVILY UPON OTHER UNFASHIONABLE THINKERS I'M THINKING OF GILLES DELEUZE WHO IN A FRENCH ACADEMY IN LOVE WITH HEIDEGGER AND HEGEL WROTE HIS FIRST BOOK ON HUME
IT'S A POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE STRESSED IN EVERY AGE NO MATTER WHAT LANGUAGE IS USED TO MAKE IT I PURPOSEFULLY SEEK OUT PEOPLE WHO I DISAGREE WITH SO THAT I CAN CHALLENGE MYSELF TO TAKE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND BE ENRICHED BY THEIR UNIQUE UNDERSTANDINGS UNFASHIONABLE PHILOSOPHY IS OFTEN DISMISSED OUT OF HAND AND THIS IS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE SOME PHILOSOPHERS ARE LABELED MYSTICS OR INSANE GIVING LITTLE REASON TO CONSIDER THEIR POINT OF VIEW SOME OF THE BEST PHILOSOPHIES ARE LAUGHED AT BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM THE MAINSTREAM IS THIS SUCH A BAD THING FOR SOME REASON MANY PEOPLE FEEL THREATENED BY NEW OR UNSAVORY IDEAS AS IF THEY'RE BEING COMPELLED TO ADOPT THEM
UNFASHIONABLE HAS A LARGE RANGE FROM ALMOST FORGOTTEN TO OUTRIGHT REVILED TRY POSTING SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT SAY ROGER SCRUTON TO SEE THE LATTER BUT THE ULTIMATE DIVIDE BETWEEN FASHIONABLE AND UNFASHIONABLE WILL ALWAYS BE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION CAN AN INTERESTED READER UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT AN INTERMEDIARY IF THE ANSWER IS NO THEN YOU'VE GOT A FASHIONABLE PHILOSOPHY THIS IS WHY THE STOICS WILL NEVER BE REALLY HIP OR MY FAVORITE GUY EAST MASCULINE CIOBAN CYNICAL BUT I THINK A LAYMAN IS ALLOWED THAT OPINION
ISN'T THIS TRUE FOR UNFASHIONABLE IDEAS AS WELL I THINK MORE SO DON'T GO BEHIND UNFASHIONABLE PEOPLE RATHER GO BEHIND UNFASHIONABLE IDEAS HOWEVER NOT ONLY IN PHILOSOPHY IN EVERY OTHER FIELD OF INQUIRY CONTEMPORARY ACADEMIA IS RUNNING AFTER FASHION
SUMMARY
KANT FAMOUSLY CLAIMS THAT WE HAVE SYNTHETIC APRIORI KNOWLEDGE INDEED THIS CLAIM IS ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL TO ALL OF HIS PHILOSOPHY BUT WHAT IS SYNTHETIC APRIORI KNOWLEDGE IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO SCOTT EDGAR HELPFULLY THIS CATEGORY OF KNOWLEDGE BY FIRST WALKING THROUGH DISTINCTION BETWEEN EMPIRICAL AND APRIORI KNOWLEDGE AND THEN HIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANALYTIC AND SYNTHETIC JUDGMENTS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE DISTINCTIONS IS THEN ILLUSTRATED WITH NUMEROUS EXAMPLES MAKING IT CLEAR WHY KANT UNLIKE HUME THOUGHT THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE THAT IS BOTH APRIORI AND SYNTHETIC AND THAT THIS IS THE TYPE OF KNOWLEDGE PHILOSOPHERS SEEK

INTERESTING VIDEO THANKS
THIS IS A QUESTION I THINK I'VE HEARD POSED BEFORE BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THE ANSWER ARE ALL A PRIORI TRUTHS TAUTOLOGIES I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE VIDEO YET

EDIT OKAY REACHED THE END OF THE VIDEO BUT MATH IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF ANALYTIC TRUTH SINCE IT ALL DERIVES IN THEORY FROM PFC
SLIGHTLY BUT DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY AMERICANS PRONOUNCE KANT KAHN WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD INCLUDING ONE WOULD THINK IMPORTANTLY GERMANS PRONOUNCES KANT LIKE CAN'T
THE PROBLEM I SEE WITH THE NATURE THAT KANT ASCRIBES TO MATH IS IS THAT IS NOT A UNIVERSAL TRUTH IT'S A CONCLUSION FOLLOWING FROM THE PEANO AXIOMS THERE'S NO INHERENT MEANING IN THE SYMBOLS AND BEFORE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BASIC AXIOMS OF MATH THAT GIVE US ELEMENTARY OPERATIONS WE DO SO BY CHOICE WE SIMPLY HAVE CREATED ONE VERSION OF MATH THAT SUITS OUR NEEDS TO DO CALCULATION

ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE DEGREE TRIANGLE A TRIANGLE ONLY HAPPENS TO SUM UP TO DEGREES IN EUCLIDEAN SPACE IN NON-EUCLIDEAN SPACE THESE RULES DON'T APPLY THE SUM OF THE ANGLES OF A TRIANGLE ON THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE FOR EXAMPLE DOES NOT EQUATE DEGREES IMAGE

KANT ALREADY PRESUPPOSES SOME KIND OF PLATONIC CHARACTER TO NUMBERS WITHOUT GIVING REAL MOTIVATION WHY THIS IS INTUITIVE AT LEAST FROM THIS VIDEO I HAVEN'T READ KANT ADMITTEDLY

WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING TO HEAR SOME CRITICISM OF THIS IN THE VIDEO OTHERWISE A VERY CONCISE EXPLANATION
TO SAY THAT THE SUM OF THE INTERIOR ANGLES OF A TRIANGLE EQUAL DEGREES APPEARS TO ME TO REMAIN A TAUTOLOGICAL TRUTH BECAUSE THE INTERIOR ANGLES MERELY STAND AS AN AXIOMATIC RELATIONSHIP OF A THREE SIDED OBJECT IN OTHER WORDS THE DEGREE INTERIOR ANGLE SUMMATION IS IMPLICITLY CONTAINED WITHIN OUR EVOLVED CONCEPT OF A TRIANGLE THE TAUTOLOGICAL STATEMENT ALL BACHELORS ARE UNMARRIED MEN IMPLICITLY CONTAINS CONCEPTS OF CEREMONIAL COUPLING DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP AND BINDING COMMITMENT WHICH ARE STATES OF HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS THAT STAND OPPOSITE TO A BACHELOR IN OTHER WORDS DID WE ACTUALLY LEARN ABOUT THE CONCEPTS OF COUPLING AND PARTNERSHIP FROM THE CONCEPT OF BACHELOR OR ARE THEY CONTAINED WITHIN THE CONCEPT OF A BACHELOR
I MIGHT BE MISSING SOMETHING BUT TO ME IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE EXAMPLE OF MATH AS A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE WE CAN AND DO USE EMPIRICAL METHODS TO VERIFY THAT

IN FACT THE USEFULNESS OF MOST BASIC MATH IS THAT ITS RESULTS CAN AND ARE VERIFIED BY EMPIRICAL METHODS WHICH IS WHY IT'S EXTENSIVELY USED IN ENGINEERING A LOT OF BASIC MATH CAME OUT OF TRIAL AND ERROR AND EXPERIMENTATION WHICH DEPENDS ON EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS
WHAT'S ITS NATURE SURELY

I WRITE FICTION I TRY TO DO IT BETTER SO I OFTEN READ BOOKS ABOUT HOW IT'S DONE THE GOOD ONES STRESS BEING EVOCATIVE COMPASSIONATE AND CLEAR BUT SOME ARE GUIDES ON HOW TO ADDICT THE READER I FIND THOSE DISTURBING I CAN TELL TOO WHEN I'M READING A BOOK WHETHER IT WAS WRITTEN TO GIVE ME AN EXPERIENCE OR TO KEEP ME READING IT IT'S OKAY THOUGH I CAN QUIT THE BOOK WHEN I REALIZE IT'S JUST A TRICK BUT WEBSITES WE USE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE THOSE ARE A BIGGER PROBLEM
BUT WHY SPECIFICALLY APPLY THIS TO THE INTERNET THE HYPOTHESIS APPLIES TO ALL ADVERTISING I DON'T SEE HOW THE CONCLUSION IS REGULATE THE INTERNET RATHER THAN REGULATE ADVERTISING
SHOULD PEOPLE BE ABLE TO CHOOSE SHOULDN'T PEOPLE BE OFFERED ACTIVE HELP WHEN THEIR LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION ARE TOO HIGH IS REGULATION THE SOLUTION
WHEN I VISIT AMERICA I SEE OBESE PEOPLE AND THAT IS SO PAINFUL BECAUSE DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER PLACES OF THE WORLD FAST FOOD IS VERY CHEAP AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE AND EASY TO BUY AND EAT

I DON'T KNOW THIS ALL SOUNDS LIKE A DIATRIBE OF WE NEED TO LIMIT YOUR FREEDOMS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD SURELY THAT'S A WARNING FLAG

WE ALREADY HAVE UNCONSCIONABLE LAWS AGAINST THINGS THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD PREFER TO HAVE ACCESS TO IS REGULATING ANOTHER VOLUNTARY INTERACTION GOING TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN RESTRICTING THE CHOICES OF INDIVIDUALS

IF YOU THINK REGULATING THIS TYPE OF INTERACTION IS GOOD AND POSITIVE THEN WHY NOT SIMPLY IMPLEMENT IT IN YOUR OWN LIFE AND LEAVE OTHERS ALONE I THINK IT'S SMART TO WEAR A HELMET ON A MOTORCYCLE I CONSIDER IT A NECESSITY I'D NEVER GO TELL SOMEONE ELSE THEY MUST WEAR ONE
AGREED

I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT WHAT IS OCCURRING IN THE ECONOMY OF GAMES

MANY NEW GAMES ARE PUT ON THE MARKET FOR SALE BEFORE THEY ARE EVEN CONSIDERED FINISHED PRODUCTS COMPANIES WILL TAKE MONEY FROM CUSTOMERS FOR PREORDER MONTHS EVEN YEARS BEFORE THERE IS ANYTHING AT ALL TO RELEASE

GAMES EVEN SELL THEIR OWN VIRTUAL CURRENCY

AND THEY CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY BY CREATING DIGITAL LIMITS ON THE ACQUISITION OF DIGITAL GOODS THAT IS THE DATA CAN ALREADY BE ON YOUR COMPUTER INCLUDED IN THE INITIAL PURCHASE BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY EXTRA TO UNLOCK IT

AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT THEY WILL ADD ELEMENTS TO THIS ALREADY ARTIFICIAL SCARCITY



SO YOU PAY TO PLAY A GAME BEFORE IT IS FINISHED

THEN YOU PAY EXTRA FOR ADDITIONAL LEVELS MAYBE A MONTHLY FEE

THEN YOU PAY EXTRA TO BUY VIRTUAL CURRENCY IN THE GAME

THEN YOU PAY FOR A CHANCE TO ACQUIRE SOME OTHER DIGITAL ITEM

AND THESE GAMES MARKET THEMSELVES AS FREE TO PLAY DESPITE RAKING IN FARM MORE REVENUE THAN MOST PAY TO PLAY GAMES

BECAUSE THESE GAMES DO OPERATE LIKE CASINOS THERE IS USUALLY SOME SOCIAL ELEMENT TO ENCOURAGE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION

RANDOMNESS PROMOTES COMMITMENT TO SUNK COSTS YOU NEED THIS RARE ITEM TO WIN OR IMPRESS BUT YOUR CHANCES OF BUYING IT ARE LOW BUT YOU'VE ALREADY DUMP TRYING TO ACQUIRE IT SO YOU THINK YOU'LL GET IT FOR SURE IF YOU JUST THROW ANOTHER AFTER IT AND SO ON

WE CAN GO ONTO GAME FORUMS AND PUBLICATIONS AND READ REPORTS OF PEOPLE WHO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON FREE GAMES



THESE PEOPLE ALWAYS JUSTIFY IT WITH PHRASES LIKE OH I HAVE LOTS OF MONEY AND IT DOESN'T MATTER OR OH THIS GAME IS MY ONLY REAL HOBBY SO I DON'T MIND SPENDING SO MUCH ON IT

RATIONALIZATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE PRODUCED BY THE MINDS OF THOSE WITH GAMBLING ADDICTIONS



YES GAMES AND REALLY ANYTHING THAT TAKES ON THE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE CASINO OUGHT TO BE REGULATED LIKE THE CASINO

COMPANIES LIKE BLIZZARD AND VALVE ALREADY HAVE PSYCHOLOGISTS EMPLOYED THEY ARE DEVELOPING AN INCREASINGLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE TAKING EVERYTHING FROM YOU AS FUN FOR YOU AS POSSIBLE
COMMENTS TL ROYAL ADVERTISING MAKES PUBLISHERS STAY AFLOAT OTHERWISE YOU WOULD BE PAYING FOR CONTENT INCLUDING THIS SITE WHERE ARE ADVERTISERS THERE IS COMPETITION WHERE IS COMPETITION THERE IS SCIENCE INVOLVED TO PUT YOU AHEAD OF THE COMPETITORS DEAL WITH IT AND DON'T WHINE OR START PAYING FOR CONTENTION ON EVERY SITE BECAUSE IT COSTS MONEY TO PRODUCE CONTENT TO WRITE HOST AND MAINTAIN THE SITE TO DEFEND IT AND YOUR INFORMATION IF YOU HAVE TO LOGIN LIKE HERE FROM THE HACKERS ETC ETC HAVE YOU SEEN ENGINEERS SALARIES THESE DAYS SYSTEM ARCHITECTS SALARIES ENTERPRISE LEVEL HOSTING AND SUPPORT YOU DAMN RIGHT YOU ARE THE COMMODITY THESE DAYS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR CONTENT AND THEY NEED TO MAKE YOU BUY SOMETHING SOMEHOW
HIGHEST PAID DOESN'T MEAN SMARTEST
CASINOS AND DRUGS SHOULD ONLY BE REGULATED TO MAKE SURE SELLERS ARE BEING HONEST
IT'S INCREDIBLE TO ME HOW ERODED PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY HAS BECOME NO ONE IS UNDER ANY OBLIGATION TO VISIT ANY WEBSITE
LITERALLY MAPLESTORY BACK IN THE DAY WITH CUBES
MAN COMCAST IS TRYING REALLY HARD HERE BOTHANSINDISGUISE YOU AREN'T FOOLING ME
STAY AWAY FROM THE INTERNET
INTERESTING TO NOTE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF VIDEO ARCADE MACHINES THE JUXTAPOSITION OF GAMING IN VEGAS MEETS SOFTWARE COMPANIES FROM SILICON VALLEY

QUESTION HOW CAN WE GET PEOPLE TO PUT QUARTERS IN MACHINES WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF PAYOUT IN JACKPOTS VEGAS BRIGHT FLASHING LIGHTS AND TINKLY MUSIC SO THE SLOT MACHINE WIZARDS HELPED ATARI FOR INSTANCE DEVELOP ARCADE GAMES THAT DREW MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVERNIGHT

NOWADAYS THAT HIGHLY DEVELOPED GAMING PHILOSOPHY IS ITS OWN UNIVERSE SUCKING THE MINDS OF CHILDREN INTO A VORTEX OF MIND NUMBING CASINO STYLE REWARD FROM AN EARLY AGE

WE ALL MAY THINK ITS PERFECTLY HARMLESS BUT I REMEMBER THE BEGINNINGS OF IT ALL I WAS THERE MY BRAIN WAS FRIED MY FINGERS NUMB AND ALL MY QUARTERS GONE

I HOPE YOUR KIDS DON'T BECOME TOO SELFISH NARCISSISTIC AND AUTISTIC BEHIND THE GENRE OH WAIT NEVER MIND
ONLY A SOCIALIST COMMIE PINKO WOULD WANT TO ALTER THE FREEDOM OF THE NETS FUCK THIS AUTHOR
WHERE ARE WE COMMUNIST RUSSIA WELCOME TO CAPITALISM AND ADVERTISING
AGREED WE NEED TO LET THE GOVERNMENT GET THEIR CORRUPT TENDRILS ALL UP IN THE INTERNET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

I SPENT MY ENTIRE SAVINGS ON CLASH OF CLANS AND NOW I'M HOMELESS IT'S NOT MY FAULT THOUGH IT'S THOSE DATUM GAME COMPANIES WHO MAKE THEIR GAMES TOO IRRESISTABLE TO MY SMALL REPTILIAN BRAIN AND IF THE BASED GOVERNMENT HAD BEEN THERE TO PROTECT ME FROM THESE EVIL GAMING COMPANIES I WOULD STILL HAVE MY MONEY TODAY OR NOT BECAUSE I PROBABLY BLOWN IT ON SOME OTHER FRIVOLOUS ACTIVITY LOL
SO THE GLOBALISTS CAN CO-OPT AND CENSOR IT EVEN MORE EASILY WHILE I APPRECIATE THE OFFER TO HAVE THE GOVERNMENT LOOK OUT FOR MY INTERESTS I THINK I WOULD FEEL A LOT SAFER WITH MY OWN JUDGMENT AS OPPOSED TO FOR HIRE LAWMAKERS THANKS AGAIN FOR ASKING MUCH APPRECIATED
GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE WORST STATISTICIANS AND COMPUTER SCIENTISTS WORKING FOR THEM THIS STATIST GARBAGE IS A JOKE

I FOUND THIS TO BE A VERY PLEASANT AND USEFUL CONVERSATION IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY ENLIGHTENING SINCE I'M FAMILIAR WITH BOTH AND WORK AND THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL SURPRISES IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY DID AND DIDN'T AGREE ABOUT BUT WHAT IT SHOWED TO ME AT LEAST IS THAT DESPITE THE INTENSE HATRED OF HARRIS AND OTHER PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS BY MANY FOLKS WHO CLAIM TO REPRESENT REAL I EAST ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY ACTUAL PHILOSOPHERS DON'T HARBOR ANY OF THIS SALTY ILL WILL AT ALL THE CONVERSATION WAS PERFECTLY CORDIAL AND RESPECTFUL AND WAS CLEARLY CLEARLY AN ATTEMPT BY HARRIS TO HAVE AN OPEN-MINDED OPEN-ENDED AND HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT IDEAS PREVIOUS PODCASTS WITH DAVID CHALMERS AND DAN DENNETT DID THE SAME

FOLKS DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH HARRIS OR GIVE HIS WORK ANY CREDENCE BUT THE WIDESPREAD MALIGNING OF HIS INTENTIONS AND CHARACTER HERE AND ELSEWHERE ONLINE IS TOXIC AND UNPRODUCTIVE WE CAN LEARN THAT LESSON DIRECTLY FROM SINGER AND CHALMERS AND DENNETT THEMSELVES WHO SHOW US THE HIGHER PATH TO BUILDING BETTER DISCOURSE
YOU KNOW HARRIS HASN'T READ A DAMN THING ABOUT KANT WHEN HE SAYS AT THAT AND I PARAPHRASE KANT DEONTOLOGIST CARE ABOUT CONSEQUENCES

KANT IN THE PREFACE OF GROUNDWORK OF THE METAPHYSICS OF MORALS

SINCE MY AIM HERE IS DIRECTED PROPERLY TO MORAL PHILOSOPHY I LIMIT THE QUESTION PROPOSED ONLY TO THIS IS IT NOT THOUGHT TO BE OF THE UTMOST NECESSITY TO WORK OUT FOR ONCE A PURE MORAL PHILOSOPHY COMPLETELY CLEANSED OF EVERYTHING THAT MAY BE ONLY EMPIRICAL AND THAT BELONGS TO ANTHROPOLOGY FOR THAT THERE MUST BE SUCH A PHILOSOPHY IS CLEAR OF ITSELF FROM THE COMMON IDEA OF DUTY AND OF MORAL LAWS EVERYONE MUST GRANT THAT A LAW IF IT IS TO HOLD MORALLY THAT IS AS A GROUND OF AN OBLIGATION MUST CARRY WITH IT ABSOLUTE NECESSITY THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMAND THOU SHALT NOT LIE DOES NOT HOLD ONLY FOR HUMAN BEINGS AS IF OTHER RATIONAL BEINGS DID NOT HAVE TO HEED IT AND SO WITH ALL OTHER MORAL LAWS PROPERLY SO CALLED THAT THEREFORE THE GROUND OF OBLIGATION HERE MUST NOT BE SOUGHT IN THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN BEING OR IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE WORLD IN WHICH HE IS PLACED BUT A PRIORI SIMPLY IN CONCEPTS OF PURE REASON AND THAT ANY OTHER PRECEPT WHICH IS BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF MERE EXPERIENCE EVEN IF IT IS UNIVERSAL IN A CERTAIN RESPECT INSOFAR AS IT RESTS IN THE LEAST PART ON EMPIRICAL GROUNDS PERHAPS ONLY IN TERMS OF A MOTIVE CAN INDEED BE CALLED A PRACTICAL RULE BUT NEVER A MORAL LAW

EDIT THERE IS ALSO A FACTUAL ERROR IN THIS SEEM TO PARROT THE PROPAGANDA THAT PALESTINIANS USE HUMAN SHIELDS AND ISRAELIS DON'T EXCEPT THAT FACTS POINT TO THE CONTRARY OF THIS LINE OF PROPAGANDA

U N ACCUSES ISRAEL OF CONTINUOUS USE OF PALESTINIAN CHILDREN AS HUMAN SHIELDS AND INFORMANTS

ALSO AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL DOES NOT HAVE EVIDENCE AT THIS POINT THAT PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY USED BY HAMAS OR PALESTINIAN ARMED GROUPS DURING THE CURRENT HOSTILITIES TO SHIELD SPECIFIC LOCATIONS OR MILITARY PERSONNEL OR EQUIPMENT FROM ISRAELI ATTACKS

EDIT 2 SEEMS LIKE HE USED THE WORD SNEAK IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY INITIAL PHRASING EVEN THOUGH I SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED I WAS PARAPHRASING


DELETED
MORAL DIGNITY
WHAT I WANNA KNOW IS WHY ANYTHING THAT IS A PRODUCT OF WESTERN MODERNITY IS AUTOMATICALLY GARBAGE

SO STOP USING ANYTHING THAT SCIENCE HAS CREATED AND SEE HOW LONG YOU CAN LIVE
IS THIS PERSON A PHILOSOPHER OR JUST A STUDENT BECAUSE IT MIGHT GET TIME CONSUMING TO ENGAGE WITH EVERY NAIVE POSITION STUDENTS TAKE
NOT ONLY WAS THE VIDEO OF THIS SPEECH TO WATCH SHE TAKES A BRIEF PAUSE TO PLAY ON HER TABLET
IF THEY WANT TO LIVE IN THE STONE AGE AND DIE AT THE AGE OF THAN LET THEM MAYBE THEIR CHILDREN WILL WANT BETTER LIVES AND FUTURES
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT SHE'S MAKING COLONIALISM DID HORRIFIC THINGS TO MANY INDIGENOUS CULTURES BUT IT WAS DONE MOSTLY IN THE DRIVE FOR RESOURCES NOT KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING
THIS IS THE BULLSHIT YOU GET WHEN YOU DROP THE PASS RATE TO PERCENT
SHE JUST MAD CAUSE WHITE FOLK FIGURED IT OUT FIRST ANY AFRICANS WHO STUDIED THAT SHIT THE SAME WAY HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSIONS
THE MOVEMENT CALLS FOR THE FALL OF WESTERN SCIENCE AND OTHER WESTERNS MOVEMENTS IN ACADEMY SHE THEN CARRIES ON TO USE HER CELLPHONE AND BUY CLOTHES AT THE SHOP AND USE MEDICINE ALL THE THINGS CREATED BY WESTERNERS

THAT ISN'T A VALID ARGUMENT OR EVEN ANY KIND OF REAL ARGUMENT AT ALL

GALILEO WASN'T WRONG IN HIS CRITIQUE OF THE CHURCH AT THE TIME JUST BECAUSE THE CHURCH WAS THE REIGNING IDEOLOGY OF THE DAY AND HE STILL ENJOYED THE PRODUCTS OF CIVILIZATION USING YOUR LOGIC EVERY ACT OF SOCIAL CRITICISM IS INVALID BECAUSE IT OCCURS WITHIN AND WITH THE PROTECTION AND RESOURCES OF A PARTICULAR SOCIETY WHICH IS TOTALLY ILLOGICAL AND JUST AS SELF-REFUTING AS YOU'RE ACCUSING OTHERS OF BEING
I THINK I SEE WHY THEY ARE HAVING THE PROBLEM THEY ARE THE THING IS THAT WESTERN SCIENCE WAS NOT INTRODUCED THROUGH A NATURAL PROCESS OF DIFFUSION OR CONTACT BUT WAS INTRODUCED AT THE BAD END OF A GUN TOGETHER WITH THE IDEA THAT ALL OF THEIR OWN CULTURE IS BAD AND WORTHLESS I THINK THE RESENTMENT TOWARD THINGS FORCED UPON YOU WITH VIOLENCE AND OTHER ACTS WHICH ARE UTTERLY AGAINST DIGNIFIED MORALITY IS A VERY NATURAL AND UNDERSTANDABLE HUMAN RESPONSE THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN THIS CASE IT'S WRONG BECAUSE SCIENCE DOES EXPLAIN THINGS BETTER THAN MAGIC DOES I THINK IT'S A VERY NATURAL REACTION TO WANT TO SHUT OUT OUTSIDERS WHEN THOSE OUTSIDERS VIOLATED YOU IN A VERY UGLY AND ABSOLUTELY UNJUSTIFIABLE FASHION IT'S KIND OF LIKE ASKING A WOMAN WHO WAS RAPED MULTIPLE TIMES OVER YEARS TO LISTEN TO HER RAPIST EVEN IF THE RAPIST IS SAYING SOMETHING TRUE THE FACT THAT HE IS HER RAPIST IS GOING TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR HER TO LISTEN TO ANY OF IT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE IN SUCH A SITUATION HERE THE RAPIST WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND THE WOMAN AFRICAN CIVILIZATION IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND A GOOD ANSWER ULTIMATELY BECAUSE IT IS TRUE AND WORKS BETTER THAN MAGIC SCIENCE MUST BE ACCEPTED IF THE PEOPLE ARE TO IMPROVE THEIR LIFE QUALITY AND BE FREE OF THINGS LIKE DISEASE AND FAMINE THE MORE GENERAL QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU CONVINCE SOMEONE TO ACCEPT THE TRUTH OF SOMETHING TRUE THAT IS SAID TO THEM BY SOMEONE WHO IN THE PAST COMMITTED SERIOUSLY UNETHICAL ACTS TOWARD THEM ACTS WHOSE EFFECTS ARE NOT YET OVERCOME AND FOR WHICH PROPER JUSTICE IS NOT YET MADE FURTHERMORE IS THAT ETHICAL IN ITSELF MY GUT SAYS IT'S NOT THE RAPIST S PLACE TO DO THAT TO THEIR OWN VICTIM AND IF WHAT THE RAPIST IS SAYING IS TRUE IT NEEDS TO BE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THE RAPIST I EAST NOT FROM THE WESTERN CULTURE WHETHER OTHER AFRICANS OR WHO ARE ALSO NOT WESTERN TO ADVOCATE FOR IT TO SAID VICTIM AT LEAST IF THE VICTIM HAS NOT YET FORGIVEN THE RAPIST AND THE WOUNDS ARE NOT YET HEALED WHICH IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE CASE HERE BUT COULD THAT BE WRONG WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THEY ARE INDEPENDENT PEOPLE AND THUS THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FREELY CHOOSE IF THEY WANT TO REJECT SCIENCE THEN THEY CAN SEE WHERE THAT LEADS BY FORCE OF CONSEQUENCE GO AND THROW OUT ALL THE TECHNOLOGIES MEDICINE ETC THEY ARE USING FROM THAT SCIENCE AND WHEN PEOPLE START DYING FROM THINGS THEY WEREN'T BEFORE THEY MAY SEE THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT IT TOUGH BUT IT'S THEIR CHOICE AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY I DON'T NECESSARILY ADVOCATE FOR THAT ROUTE I AM JUST POINTING IT OUT I THINK YOUR THESIS IS RIGHT ON THAT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ASSIMILATE IDEAS FROM OUTSIDE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN THIS CASE THERE IS ETHICAL BAGGAGE THAT MUST BE CONFRONTED IN ORDER TO GET THE IDEAS THROUGH AND CONFRONTING IT IN A MANNER WHICH DOES JUSTICE TO THE ISSUES IS NOT EASY AND THE ETHICAL SITUATION OF OUTSIDERS SPECIFICALLY FROM THE WEST IS DIFFERENT TO THAT OF OUTSIDERS FROM ELSEWHERE THAT IS NOT ALL OUTSIDERS ARE EQUAL IN THIS SITUATION IT'S ONE THING TO SAY ETHNORELATIVISM IS WRONG THEORETICALLY IT'S ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER THE ETHICAL MESS THAT LEADS SOME TO ADVOCATE FOR IT

THE MOVEMENT CAN BE PROUD
THIS IS SOMETHING I WROTE UP IN COLLEGE TO REFUTE MORAL RELATIVISM BUT I THINK IT ALSO APPLIES HERE

RELATIVIST ARGUE THAT THERE ARE MORAL TRUTHS THAT ARE RELATIVE TO A FRAME OF REFERENCE AND CLAIM THAT WHETHER SOMETHING IS MORAL OR IMMORAL IS DEPENDENT ON ADHERENCE TO CULTURAL VALUES THEY BELIEVE THAT MORALITY IS RELATIVE IN THE SAME MANNER THAT MOTION IS RELATIVE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER I M MOVING WHILE SITTING IN THE LIBRARY IS RELATIVE TO THE FRAME OF REFERENCE THAT IS BEING OBSERVED FROM FROM MY OWN FRAME OF REFERENCE I WOULD NOT BE MOVING HOWEVER FROM THE EARTH S FRAME OF REFERENCE I AM MOVING AT A SIGNIFICANT SPEED THROUGH SPACE THIS IS THE SAME WITH MORALITY AND THESE DIFFERENT FRAMES OF REFERENCE ARE OFTEN CULTURAL

DIFFERENT FRAMES OF REFERENCES OFTEN CONTAIN CONTRADICTIONS AMERICANS THAT SUPPORTED AND ENFORCED JIM CROW LAWS WERE ADHERING TO ACCEPTED CULTURAL VALUES OF AMERICAN SOCIETY JIM CROW LAWS WERE PROTESTED AGAINST AND DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE CULTURAL VALUES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER PARTS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY BOTH THOSE WHO SUPPORTED JIM CROW AND THOSE THAT OPPOSED JIM CROW BELIEVED THEIR CULTURAL VALUES TO BE CORRECT THE MORAL STANCES OF THESE TWO CULTURE GROUPS WERE CONTRADICTORY TO ONE ANOTHER THEREFORE CULTURE ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH SOMETHING AS MORAL OR IMMORAL THE CONSTITUTION WAS THE CORRECT FRAME OF REFERENCE AND BY ANALOGY WE CAN PRESUME THAT THERE IS A UNIVERSAL CORRECT FRAME OF REFERENCE

SOME CONTEND THAT THERE IS SO MUCH DISAGREEMENT ON MORAL ISSUES BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT FRAMES OF REFERENCE THAT IT FOLLOWS THERE IS NO CORRECT FRAME OF REFERENCE THIS IS A A CONCLUSION OR STATEMENT THAT DOES NOT LOGICALLY FOLLOW FROM A PREVIOUS ARGUMENT OR STATEMENT THIS IS SYNONYMOUS TO SAYING THAT BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH DISAGREEMENT ON THE EXISTENCE AND NATURE OF GOD THAT THERE IS NO TRUTH TO WHETHER GOD EXISTS OR GOD S NATURE HOWEVER THERE IS TRUTH ON THE MATTER EITHER GOD EXISTS OR GOD DOES NOT AND IF THERE IS A GOD THEN GOD IS THE ABRAHAMIC GOD A DEIST GOD SOME NOTION OF GOD THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ETC THERE IS TRUTH TO THE MATTER WHETHER WE DON T KNOW IT OR WE DISAGREE ON THE MATTER THIS CAN BE APPLIED TO MORALITY OR ANY OTHER MATTER DISAGREEMENT NO MATTER HOW PREVALENT IT IS DOES NOT MEAN THERE IS NO TRUTH TO THE MATTER JUST LIKE PREVALENT AGREEMENT OR VOTES DOES NOT DETERMINE WHAT IS JUST OR TRUE THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON BUT THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE CLAIM THAT THERE IS NO CORRECT FRAME OF REFERENCE BECAUSE IT IS ALL RELATIVE

THE SIGNIFICANT SHARING OF MORAL VALUES WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A PARTICULAR FRAME OF REFERENCE THAT IS CORRECT TORTURING INFANTS SOLELY FOR AMUSEMENT IS CONSIDERED IMMORAL THROUGHOUT ALL CULTURES AND HISTORY THE EXISTENCE OF A UNIVERSAL MORAL STANDARD SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS LIKELY AN OBJECTIVE STANDARD THEREFORE THERE IS LIKELY AN OBJECTIVE MORAL STANDARD VALUING HUMAN LIFE AND TELLING THE TRUTH ARE LIKELY CONTENDERS IF SOCIETIES JUST KILLED PEOPLE AND LIED WILLY NILLY THEN NO VIABLE SOCIETIES COULD BE PRODUCED AS SOCIETIES RELY ON THESE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES ALSO MORAL DISAGREEMENTS ARE OVERREPRESENTED IN OUR MEDIA AS THERE IS NO REASON TO DISCUSS WHETHER A PARENT SHOULD PROVIDE BASIC NEEDS FOR THEIR CHILD WHETHER DENTISTS SHOULD UNNECESSARILY PULL OUT TEETH TO MAKE EXTRA MONEY OR WHETHER COURAGE IS A VIRTUE

THE UNDERLYING MORAL STANDARDS OF DIFFERENT FRAMES OF REFERENCE ARE NOT ALWAYS APPARENT ACTS THAT MAY SEEM MORAL OR IMMORAL MAY ALSO USE THE SAME MORAL STANDARD AS MOTIVATION FOR THE ACT FOR EXAMPLE ESKIMOS PRACTICED LEAVING INFANTS OUT IN THE ENVIRONMENT TO DIE FROM EXPOSURE AT FIRST GLANCE THIS MIGHT SUGGEST THAT ESKIMO MORALS AND OUR OWN MORALS ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT HOWEVER ESKIMOS LEFT INFANTS TO DIE FROM EXPOSURE SO THAT THE REST OF THE FAMILY HAD ENOUGH RESOURCES TO SURVIVE BOTH THE ESKIMOS AND OUR OWN CULTURE SEEM TO SHARE A FUNDAMENTAL MORAL STANDARD TO PRESERVE VALUE HUMAN LIFE

IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT THERE IS A CORRECT FRAME OF REFERENCE MANY CULTURES SHARE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MORAL BELIEFS BUT THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS BE APPARENT AND DISAGREEMENTS TEND TO RECEIVE MORE ATTENTION SIMPLE DISAGREEMENTS IN FRAMES OF REFERENCE DO NOT SIGNIFY THAT THERE IS NO CORRECT FRAME OF REFERENCE FRAMES OF REFERENCE CAN ALSO BE SHOWN TO BE FALSE SUCH AS THE JIM CROW FRAME OF REFERENCE IF THERE IS A CORRECT FRAME OF REFERENCE THEN THERE WILL BE OBJECTIVE MORAL TRUTHS
NO ON IN THAT ROOM TOOK HER SERIOUSLY WHY SHOULD ANYONE HERE
GLAD YOU FEW GOT RIGHT BOTHERED ALL TRUTH IS RELATIVE ISN'T A PROVABLE NOR RATIONAL INTRO AND IT SEEMS HEAVILY ENCUMBERED BY THE PRESUPPOSITION THAT EVERYONE AGREES WITH YOUR CERTAIN UNIVERSAL MORALISM NEVERTHELESS IT'S DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW RATIONAL HERE
ALL LIES ARE RELATIVE
THEORETICALLY IF ONE ASSUMES THAT THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE REALITY THAT IS AS WE PERCEIVE IT WITH OUR SENSES THEN THERE IS OBJECTIVE TRUTH

HOWEVER SUCH A CLAIM IS UNABLE TO BE SUPPORTED OUR ONLY EVIDENCE OF REALITY IS OUR OWN PERCEPTION AND MEMORY BOTH OF WHICH ARE PROVEN BY STUDIES AND NEARLY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO BE OFTEN FAULTY THUS THE VERITABILITY OF REALITY AND SUBSEQUENTLY ANY OBJECTIVE TRUTH IS LOST

MY ARGUMENT BEING THAT IN PHILOSOPHY TRUTH IS RELATIVE YES HOWEVER OFTEN THESE DISCREPANCIES IN PERCEPTION AND MEMORY AND THEIR EFFECTS ARE MINOR ENOUGH TO PROCEED OUR LIVES AND SOCIAL PROGRESSION UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT REALITY IS REAL AND THAT WHAT HE AND I SAW ACTUALLY HAPPENED

AS FOR THE OTHER ARGUMENT ESSENTIALLY ABOUT BIGOTRY AND CALLING ONESELF CORRECT INDEFINITELY BECAUSE OF SUCH A PRACTICALLY MINOR DISCREPANCY AND HOW IT PROHIBITS PROGRESSION I HAVE TO PARTIALLY AGREE IT DEPENDS ON THE SCALE TO WHICH THIS IDEA IS APPLIED IF EACH INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYS IT ACTIVELY THEN PROGRESSION WILL OCCUR EXPONENTIALLY SLOWER THAN IF A SMALL SOCIETY THAN IF A LARGER SOCIETY OR THAN IF NOBODY EMPLOYING IT WILLIAM STATISTICALLY HOWEVER PROGRESSION WILL OCCUR PER EACH INDIVIDUAL GROUP THAT ACCEPTS REACH OTHER INDIVIDUALS WILL STILL PROGRESS EVEN IF THEY ACCEPT NO OTHER IDEAS BUT IT WILL BE DRASTICALLY SLOWER THAN EVEN WORKING WITH OTHER PERSON BECAUSE OF OBVIOUS REASONS THEY ONLY HAVE THEIR SET OF IDEAS AND ONLY PERSONALITY AND WAY OF THINKING WITH WHICH TO REVIEW ANY IDEAS

MY POINT BEING THAT PROGRESS WILL HAPPEN REGARDLESS HENCE HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE NOW BUT THE MORE OPEN-MINDED WE ARE THE MORE WILLING WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER RESPECT OUR DIFFERENCES AND TO WORK TOGETHER THE MORE EFFICIENT AND PROGRESSIVE WE WILL BE

IF YOU WANT TO END ON A HAPPY NOTE SO READING HERE

BECAUSE AS OPTIMISTIC AS THAT SOUNDS STATISTICALLY THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE UNWILLING TO FOLLOW ANY SUCH ADVICE OR LOGIC UTOPIA IS FORBIDDEN BY HUMAN NATURE BECAUSE WE'RE GREEDY SELFISH AND OFTEN CLOSE-MINDED DESPITE CONSCIOUS ATTEMPTS THAT'S THE REASON COMMUNISM DIDN'T ACTUALLY WORK BECAUSE IT WORKS FINE AND DANDY FOR A BIT BEFORE SOMEBODY SMART REALIZES THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM AFTER ALL IT IS A SIMPLE APPLICATION OF EVOLUTION FOR THOSE WHO ARE SMARTER TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PRAYING ON IF YOU WILL PEOPLE WHO AREN'T AS SMART HENCE POLITICS IS ALL SCREWED UP
WE HAD TO READ THE STRANGER IN FRESHMAN YEAR OF MY CATHOLIC HIGHSCHOOL AFTER BEING RAISED AS A MUSLIM THEN MY ATHEIST DAD FORBIDDING MY MUSLIM MOM FROM IMPOSING A RELIGION ON THEIR CHILDREN THEN GOING TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL I HAD A MEGA PARADIGM SHIFT

IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE THAT I EVEN CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF A UNIVERSE WITHOUT INHERENT MEANING THAT GOD POSSIBLY DOES NOT EXIST IT WAS PROBABLY SIMILAR TO HOW NEO FELT WHEN HE REALIZE WHAT THE MATRIX WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME

NOW AFTER A COUPLE MORE DECADES OF SLOWLY DEVELOPING MY OWN PERSONAL SPIRITUALITY AND MEANING I NOW WONDER IF CAMUS THINKING AND BUDDHISM MAY HAVE SOME PARALLELS MAINLY THAT OF THE MINDFULNESS OF EXISTENCE IN AND OF ITSELF THE VERY AWARENESS OF OUR EXISTENCE AND THE CONSTANT CENTERING OF ONESELF WITH IT IS WHAT GROUNDS US IN AUTHENTICITY AND MEANING

ONE COULD SAY THE PROTAGONIST IN THE STRANGER REACHED SOME FORM OF PERSONAL ENLIGHTENMENT IN THE END

EDIT FOUND AN INTERESTING THREAD IN THE R BUDDHISM SUBREDDIT THAT TOUCHES ON THIS VERY PARALLEL


AS MUCH AS I WRESTLE WITH EXISTENTIALISM IN MY MIND AM I CAPABLE OF DICTATING MY NATURE WHETHER OR NOT I BELIEVE IN THE PHILOSOPHY I AM CERTAIN THAT I DEEPLY WANT IT TO BE TRUE

EXISTENTIALISM HAS HAD THE BENEFIT OF SOME OF THE MOST RAW AND COMPELLING LITERARY EXPRESSIONS IN THE MODERN ERA AND THE STRANGER IS NO DIFFERENT I THINK WHAT I ENJOYED MOST ABOUT THIS BOOK WAS THE DEPICTION OF FREEDOM AS MAN'S NATURE AND AS A SOURCE OF HIS PLEASURE LIKE OXYGEN WE ONLY NOTICE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS WHEN IT IS TAKEN AWAY

I'M NOT GOING TO LIE I READ THIS BOOK AT AND IT BLEW MY MIND FOR YOU WHO READ IT IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS IT A HUGE SHOCK I REMEMBER HOW I WAS IN MY ADOLESCENCE AND I REALLY THINK THAT BOOK MIGHT HAVE PUSHED ME OVER THE EDGE MAYBE I'M JUST ONE OF THOSE SENSITIVE AND IDEALISTIC TYPES WHY I CAN'T READ DOSTOEVSKY AND HAVE A DRINK AT THE SAME TIME
I'VE SEEN THIS PASSAGE INTERPRETED IN A MYRIAD WAYS CAMUS IS ECHOING HIS ABSURDIST PHILOSOPHY IN THE FAMOUS LINE JE POUR LA PREMIERE BOIS I LA TENDRE INDIFFERENCE DU MONDE CAMUS THINKS THAT THE WORLD IS INDIFFERENT TO OUR SUFFERING HARD TO DISAGREE WITH THIS AND THAT ALL MEANING IS RELATIVE TO THE INDIVIDUAL FOR CAMUS THERE IS NO DISCERNIBLE INHERENT MEANING IN THE UNIVERSE RATHER THAN CLING TO GOD OR SOME OTHER ABSOLUTE CAMUS AND HIS CHARACTER MEURSAULT OPEN THEMSELVES TO THE TENDER INDIFFERENCE OF THE WORLD FROM THIS VIEW THERE IS NO HOPE NO MEANING NO SALVATION ONLY LIFE ITSELF IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT MEURSAULT IS LIVING AN AUTHENTIC LIFE HE'S MERELY LIVING HIS LAST MOMENTS WITH AN INTENSE AESTHETIC AWARENESS OF THE WORLD

YOU'LL FIND A SIMILAR IF NOT THE SAME CONCEPT IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF ZHUANGZI MOST PHILOSOPHIES ENTAIL SOME KIND OF INHERENT MEANING OR GOAL IN OUR LIVES BUT FOR CAMUS AND ZHUANGZI THESE THINGS AREN'T NEEDED TO ENJOY LIFE THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THEY WANT TO DESTROY ALL MEANING THEY JUST DON'T ALLOW MEANING TO DIRECT THEIR LIVES LAST MOMENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN DREADFUL IF HE WAS TRYING TO FIND SOLACE IN THE MEANING OF HIS DEATH WHATEVER HE CHOSE THAT TO BE INSTEAD HE ENJOYED HIS FATE FOR WHAT IT WAS
ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ EVEN THAT IT WAS IN FRENCH INSTEAD OF MY MOTHER'S TONGUE GERMAN
AN EYE OPENER CAMUS PERFECTIONIZE THE STYLE OF SHORT EXPRESSIVE GRAPHIC SENTENCES MUST READ EVEN FOR NON LITERATURE STUDENTS I'M BASICALLY THE OPPOSITE OF ONE OF THAT KIND
NO COMMENTS SIMPLY AMAZING IT WAS TO READ THAT PIECE OF ART
IF YOU READ THIS BOOK AS A TEENAGER IT IS WORTH REVISITING IT WHEN YOU ARE IN YOUR AND AGAIN IN YOUR AS A TEENAGER IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE MUCH SENSE TO ME IT MADE A LOT MORE SENSE WHEN I WAS IN MY LATE EARLY

THE STRANGER IS AS CLOSE TO A MANIFESTO FOR EXISTENTIALISM AS YOU WILL FIND CAMUS DID NOT AT ALL INTEND FOR THIS END BUT IT ALSO DIDN'T INTEND TO DIE AT IN A CAR CRASH
WHAT A NEAT THREAD IS THERE A BOT THAT CAN CRAWL THIS THREAD FOR ALL OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AND THEIR BOOKS
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT AUTHENTICITY RECENTLY MOSTLY IN RELATION TO MUSIC AND AESTHETICS BUT CAN ANYONE POINT ME TO SOME GOOD WORK ON THE SUBJECT THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT THE MORE ELUSIVE IT BECOMES I NEED SOMEONE FAR SMARTER THAN ME TO WALK ME THROUGH IT
THE STRANGER WHICH I READ AS A REQUIREMENT IN THE 9TH GRADE MADE ME MORE SELF AWARE THAN ANYTHING I HAD EXPERIENCED BEFORE

ODDLY ENOUGH IT ULTIMATELY LED TO A STRONG CATHOLIC FAITH IN THE FUTURE
REMOVED
THIS ARTICLE SEEMS TO BE OF A PRETTY LOW QUALITY EVEN IF WE SET ASIDE THE RED FLAG USE OF BUZZWORDS EAST G SCIENTISTS AND THEN MENTIONING DAWKINS OF ALL PEOPLE AND THE LOW QUALITY OF SOME OF THE BOOKS IMPLIED TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF A SCIENTIFICALLY GROUNDED WORLD-VIEW IT SEEMS RATHER OBVIOUS THE AUTHOR DID NOT EVEN DO ENOUGH RESEARCH TO GET THE BASICS RIGHT

JUST TWO EXAMPLES

THE MOST FAMOUS MOST SUCCINCT AND MOST PITILESS SUMMARY OF THE MANIFEST IMAGE S FRAUDULENCE WAS WRITTEN NEARLY YEARS AGO BY THE GENETICIST FRANCIS CRICK YOU YOUR JOYS AND YOUR SORROWS YOUR MEMORIES AND YOUR AMBITIONS YOUR SENSE OF PERSONAL IDENTITY AND FREE WILL ARE IN FACT NO MORE THAN THE BEHAVIOR OF A VAST ASSEMBLY OF NERVE CELLS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED MOLECULES WHO YOU ARE IS NOTHING BUT A PACK OF NEURONS

THIS VIEW IS THE NATURALISM THAT THE WORKSHOPPERS IN THE BERKSHIRES WERE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD NATURALISM IS ALSO CALLED MATERIALISM THE VIEW THAT ONLY MATTER EXISTS OR REDUCTIONISM THE VIEW THAT ALL LIFE FROM TABLES TO DAYDREAMS IS ULTIMATELY REDUCIBLE TO PURE PHYSICS OR DETERMINISM THE VIEW THAT EVERY PHENOMENON INCLUDING OUR OWN ACTIONS IS DETERMINED BY A PREEXISTING CAUSE WHICH WAS ITSELF DETERMINED BY ANOTHER CAUSE AND SO ON BACK TO THE BIG BANG

THE VIEW DESCRIBED BY CRICK IS PROPERLY CALLED REDUCTIONISM AND NOT NATURALISM NATURALISM DOES NOT HAVE TO BE REDUCTIONISTIC MATERIALISTIC OR DETERMINISTIC AND IN ANY CASE IS NOT EQUAL TO THESE POSITIONS WHICH CAN ACTUALLY BE HELD BY PHILOSOPHERS JUST AS WELL THE AUTHOR'S DEFINITION OF REDUCTIONISM IS ACTUALLY JUST A FORM OF PHYSICALISM THERE ARE BOTH FORMS OF REDUCTIONISM AND PHYSICALISM MATERIALISM TOO IS DISTINCT FROM PHYSICALISM EVEN IF THEY ARE OFTEN CLOSELY RELATED ALSO THERE ARE TONS OF DETERMINISM IN ADDITION TO THE POPULAR CAUSAL DETERMINISM HE USES AS A DEFINITION WHICH IS BTW FORMULATED IN A PRETTY DUMB WAY WITH ITS IMPLICATION OF MONOCAUSALITY

THESE CAPACITIES OF THE HUMAN ORGANISM ARE EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATIONS EVERYTHING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS BY DEFINITION IS AN EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION

NO IT IS NOT MANY THINGS ARE JUST BYPRODUCTS OF ACTUAL ADAPTIONS OR SOME OTHER KIND OF VARIATION THAT DID NOT YET MAKE ANY TANGIBLE DIFFERENCE REGARDING OUR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS WHILE PEOPLE ARE OF COURSE ALMOST ALWAYS FREE TO TRY TO DEFINE ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN NONSENSICAL WAYS I AM NOT SURE WE SHOULD GO ALONG WITH THE JUDGEMENT OF SOMEONE THINKING NATURALISM DETERMINISM REDUCTIONISM AND MATERIALISM ARE ALL JUST SYNONYMS IMHO MOST OF WHATEVER ELSE THE AUTHOR IS GOING TO SAY ABOUT UNUSUAL RESPONSE TO BOOK IS PROBABLY EASILY EXPLAINED BY HIS IGNORANCE OF PHILOSOPHY

EDIT IT SEEMS THE REST OF THE ARTICLE GOES ON IN MUCH THE SAME WAY EAST G CLAIMING THAT THINGS EMERGING AS PART OF AN INTERACTION BETWEEN SUBJECT AND OBJECT ULTIMATELY DO NOT EXIST AT ALL MIXING UP MATERIALISM AND DETERMINISM WHILE SPEAKING ABOUT VIEWS THERE ARE FORMS OF MATERIALISM THAT CAN INCLUDE EAST G ONTOLOGICAL PROBABILITY I E THEY ALLOW FOR NEAR DETERMINISM INSPIRED BY PROBABILISTIC INTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS CLAIMING A CRICKEAN VIEW OF THE SELF IMPLIES A PURELY RANDOM UNIVERSE WITHOUT PURPOSE OR FREE WILL EVEN THOUGH IT IMPLIES A FORM OF DETERMINISM THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF RANDOM AND THAT IS EASILY RECONCILABLE WITH COMPATIBILIST FREE WILL ETC ETC WHAT SUCH A UNIVERSE MIGHT IMPLY INSTEAD OF RANDOMNESS IS THAT EVERYTHING IS ULTIMATELY ORIGINATING FROM SOME FORM OF MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL BRUTE FACT

A VIDEO OF THE WORKSHOP SHOWS DENNETT COMPLAINING THAT A FEW BUT ONLY A FEW CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO INCORPORATE THE NATURALISTIC CONCLUSIONS OF SCIENCE INTO THEIR PHILOSOPHIZING CONTINUING TO PLAY AROUND WITH OUTMODED IDEAS LIKE MORALITY AND SOMETIMES EVEN THE SOUL

GIVEN THAT DENNET IS A COMPATIBILIST I REALLY DOUBT HE IS COMPLAINING ABOUT PHILOSOPHERS CONTINUING TO PLAY WITH OUTMODED IDEAS LIKE MORALITY OR THAT HE THINKS NATURALISTIC ACCOUNTS OF REALITY AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDE ALL POSSIBLE GROUNDING FOR OUR MORALITY

I GUESS I WILL NOW STOP WASTING MY TIME WITH THIS LOW-QUALITY ARTICLE



IF MAINSTREAM PHILOSOPHY ACADEMIA CONDEMNED BOOK THAT'S A MAJOR POINT IN THEIR FAVOR
TL R LEWIS POINTS OUT THAT STANDARD ARGUMENTS OF EVIL DEAL ONLY WITH THOSE DEEDS GOD FAILS TO PREVENT A NEGLECTED ARGUMENT IS THOSE DEEDS HE ACTIVELY PERPETRATES SPECIFICALLY LEWIS ARGUES THAT THE ORTHODOX NOTION OF TEMPORALLY EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT FOR EITHER UNBELIEF OR FINITE CRIMES IS TOTALLY UNJUST AND AN ACT OF EVIL ON GOD'S PART LEWIS CLOSES WITH REFLECTION ON HOW WE OUGHT TO REGARD THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN SUCH A GOD AND IN FACT FOLLOW HIM LEWIS THINKS WE CAN HARDLY RESPECT THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN SUCH A BEING
WASN'T THIS POSTED A FEW DAYS AGO

CHARMING MUSTACHE
IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT WHILE THIS SPIRITUAL SYSTEM DIFFERS FROM JUDAISM IN THAT JUDAISM OBVIOUSLY HAS A LAUNDRY LIST OF EXPLICIT COMMANDMENTS THE BASIC METAPHYSICAL FRAMEWORK IS IDENTICAL I'VE NOTED BEFORE THE PARALLELS BETWEEN JEWISH METAPHYSICS AND PHENOMENOLOGY INTERESTING TO READ SUCH A THROUGH EXPLANATION OF HOW AT LEAST SOME VERSIONS OF BUDDHISM ARE ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME

IN JUDAISM ALL PEOPLE ESSENTIALLY POSSESS FRAGMENTED BITS OF THE ORIGINAL SOUL OF ADAM WHICH WAS BROKEN BY THE TAINT OF KNOWLEDGE OR BELIEF THAT ONE CAN TRULY KNOW THINGS PROGRESS FOR HUMANITY IS CALLED TIKKUN OLAM OR REPAIRING THE WORLD WHICH ESSENTIALLY AMOUNTS TO CONSTRUCTIVELY INTERACTING WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD SUCH THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S SOUL IS FACILITATED IN MOVING CLOSER TO WITH THE OVER-SOUL

NO INDIVIDUAL CAN ACHIEVE THE COMPLETE REUNIFICATION OF THE OVER-SOUL ON THEIR OWN BECAUSE THERE WILL BE SOME PART OF IT WHICH SOME OTHER SOUL POSSESSES UNTIL THEY SHARE IT WHEN THE SOUL OF ADAM IS REPAIRED IN ITS ENTIRETY THE MESSIAH COMES AND WE ENTER OLAM HABA THE WORLD TO COME OR IN THIS CONTEXT THE PURE LAND
I HAVE A FEELING THIS WILL GET BURIED AND REMAIN UNREAD BUT I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS ARTICLE I'D LOVE SOME PERSPECTIVE ON I AM A TRADITIONAL BUDDHIST IN THE SENSE THAT BUDDHISM IS SIMPLY AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS THAT OUR SUFFERING IS A SELF INFLICTED CONDITION THAT CAN BE OVERCOME BY ACCEPTING AND BEING GRATEFUL FOR THE EXPERIENCE WE CALL LIFE BOTH THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE I CAN SEE HOW THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS A WEAK FRAMEWORK FOR SOCIAL CHANGE ON A MACRO LEVEL BUT IF INDIVIDUALS WERE TO COLLECTIVELY AWAKEN TO THIS UNDERSTANDING MATERIALISTIC LIFESTYLES WOULD DECREASE AND PEOPLE WOULD BE FAR MORE CONNECTED SPIRITUALLY THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE EXPERIENCED FROM THE PEOPLE I'VE MET AND MY OWN TRANSFORMATION

SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS DOES SHIN BUDDHISM ADHERE TO THIS CORE FOUNDATION AND THEN EXTEND THE CONCEPT INTO A GLOBAL AWAKENING BEING A NECESSARY PART OF OUR SPIRITUAL GROWTH OR DOES IT TAKE A DIFFERENT PATH ENTIRELY

MY SECOND QUESTION IS MORE OF A PHILOSOPHICAL ONE HOW CAN YOU HAVE SOCIETAL CHANGE WITHOUT INDIVIDUALS HAVING THEIR OWN AWAKENING I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT SPIRITUALITY IS A COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE BUT IT IS SELF EVIDENT THAT IT REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL CHANGE AT ITS CORE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANY SPIRITUAL GROWTH MUST BE BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL GIVEN WE ARE SEPARATE CONSCIOUS BEINGS ON THIS LEVEL OF REALITY HOW DOES SHIN BUDDHISM EXPECT TO PRODUCE SOCIETAL CHANGE IF INDIVIDUAL AWAKENING IS INVALID TO ME THAT SEEMS LIKE A PARADOX
I DIDNT KNOW THAT THANK YOU
I DON'T SEE HOW ANYONE READS HEGEL AND DOESN'T SEE THE WHOLE SHIFT IN IDENTITY THING YOU FIND IN EVERY ESOTERIC BUDDHIST SCHOOL AND MOST VEDIC ONES CONSCIOUS MATTER ASSIMILATES AND INTEGRATES ITSELF UNTIL IT FINDS ITSELF TO BE THE VERY APERTURE THROUGH WHICH VOID LOOKS OUT UPON ITSELF DIVERSIFIED AS THE REST OF THE WORLD
I REALLY LIKE HOW THE EXACT MOMENT I THOUGHT THIS WAS A REALLY ROUND ABOUT ATTACK ON MODERN SOCIETY AND GRASPING AT THE HINTS OF WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE CHANGE IN DIRECTION IDEOLOGY SHOULD FACE CRITIQUE IT SHOULD BE ATTACKED WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF ARGUMENT AND DEBATE WHERE ALL THE FALSEHOOD IS SHAVED AWAY AND WHAT WE ARE LEFT WITH IS THE TRUTH

I DON'T HOWEVER UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN TRULY UNITE OUR WILL AS HE REFERENCES EARLIER IN THE ARTICLE I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH EASTERN PHILOSOPHY SO FORGIVE ME IF I'M MAKING SOME MISTAKES HERE IN MY UNDERSTANDING

HOW CAN WE REASONABLY SHED OUR PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF SKEPTICISM IN ONES OWN BELIEFS BUT THIS IS TAKING IT A STEP BEYOND INTO TERRITORY I CAN'T REALLY WRAP MY SIMPLE BRAIN AROUND WHAT SORT OF STATE OF MIND LEADS TO THIS KIND OF THOUGHT

I NOTICED A FEW PARALLELS TO CHRISTIANITY BUT I CAN'T TELL IF I'M IMAGINING IT OR NOT VALUING OTHERS AND TRYING TO MAKE A FOCAL TO MOVE TOWARD NAMELY HEAVEN
YO THEM BUDDHISTS BE ON THAT NEXT LEVEL SHIT MANUAL THEY FIGURED IT ALL OUT LIKE HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO FOR REAL THOUGH
GOING TO RETREATS AND THEN RETURNING TO YOUR NORMAL LIFE IS INDEED A BIT OF A JOKE TO ME AT LEAST
REMOVED
COOL ANOTHER SINGULATARIAN ROBOTICIST DOING PHILOSOPHY WE DEFINITELY NEEDED MORE OF THIS

WE SHOULD NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE WORD KNOW INTO SEEING THE SENTENCE AS A HUMAN I CANNOT KNOW WHAT IT S LIKE TO BE A BAT AS EXPRESSING ANYTHING MORE PHILOSOPHICALLY PUZZLING THAN THE SENTENCE I AM A HUMAN NOT A BAT

THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT THE SENTENCE I AM A HUMAN NOT A BAT IS NOT PHILOSOPHICALLY PUZZLING WHICH IS STRANGE I'D ARGUE IT'S PROFOUNDLY PUZZLING FOR EXACTLY THE REASONS NAGEL PROVIDES TO BE A HUMAN AND TO NOT BE A BAT IS TO BE IN DIRECT ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FACTS OF BEING A HUMAN AND TO NOT BE IN DIRECT ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FACTS OF BEING A BAT THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO WANT TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO FACT OF BEING ANYTHING AT ALL THIS IS A BIZARRE DEEPLY COUNTERINTUITIVE CLAIM FOR WHICH THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH OF AN ARGUMENT

THE MISTAKE IS TO CONCLUDE WITH NAGEL THAT THERE MUST BE FACTS OF THE MATTER HERE CERTAIN SUBJECTIVE TRUTHS THAT ELUDE OUR POWERS OF COLLECTIVE INVESTIGATION

TO SAY THAT NO SUBJECTIVE STATES OF AFFAIRS OBTAIN IS TO JUST FLATLY DENY THAT THERE IS ANYTHING THAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ANYTHING INCLUDING US

IN THIS I TAKE MY CUE FROM THE LATER WITTGENSTEIN OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS THE PRINCIPLE THAT UNDERLIES WITTGENSTEIN S REJECTION OF PRIVATE LANGUAGE

OH GOD THE PRIVATE LANGUAGE ARGUMENT MUST BE THE MOST OVERTAXED PIECE OF PHILOSOPHY OF THE PAST YEARS

A WORD THAT REFERRED TO A PRIVATE INNER SENSATION WOULD HAVE NO USEFUL FUNCTION IN OUR LANGUAGE

THE IMPLIED PYRRHONIC CONCLUSION HERE IS THAT DUE TO THIS PUTATIVE INEFFABILITY INNER SUBJECTIVE SENSATIONS DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST OF COURSE WHAT THE AUTHOR DOESN'T TELL YOU IS THAT THIS EXACT SAME ARGUMENT IS USED BY OTHER THINKERS IN COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE WAY AS EVIDENCE THAT PRIVATE SENSATIONS ACTUALLY DO EXIST AND ARE UNSPEAKABLE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COME TO A TEXT LIKE PI WITHOUT CHECKING YOUR AGENDA AT THE DOOR

WHEN IT COMES TO THE INNER LIVES OF OTHERS THERE IS ALWAYS MORE TO BE REVEALED BY INTERACTING WITH THEM BY OBSERVING THEM BY STUDYING HOW THEY WORK BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE TO SPEAK AS IF THERE WERE SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE WHAT CAN EVER BE REVEALED

EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE THAT THERE WERE NO LIMIT TO HOW MUCH OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE WE COULD GATHER ABOUT SOME OTHER SYSTEM THIS DOES NOTHING TO DIMINISH THE OBJECTIVE SUBJECTIVE DISTINCTION IT REMAINS TRUE THAT INSOFAR AS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A SYSTEM THAT WHAT IT'S LIKENESS ONLY OBTAINS IN THE CASE OF ACTUALLY BEING THAT SYSTEM IN LIGHT OF THIS THE AUTHOR'S ARGUMENT MUST BE THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ANYTHING A RADICALLY SKEPTICAL AND I THINK INCONCEIVABLE CONCLUSION

THROUGH WITTGENSTEIN WE ARRIVE AT THE FOLLOWING PRECEPT ONLY AGAINST A BACKDROP OF PURPOSEFUL BEHAVIOUR DO WE SPEAK OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY THESE LIGHTS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE PRESENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS IT WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DISCOVER THAT A SYSTEM SUCH AS THE WHITE BOX IN OUR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT HAD HIGH I WE WOULD NEED TO DISCERN PURPOSE IN ITS BEHAVIOUR

IS HE SAYING THAT SOME METRIC LIKE PHI IS NECESSARY IN ADDITION TO BEHAVIOR OR IS BEHAVIOR ALONE SUFFICIENT IT'S UNCLEAR BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S SAYING THAT A BEHAVIORISTIC ACCOUNT OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS ALL YOU NEED WHICH IS NOT ONLY HIGHLY INTELLECTUALLY UNFASHIONABLE BUT EASILY PROBLEMATIZE ALSO PURPOSE IS WEIRDLY TELEOLOGICAL

AS A RESULT OF THESE OBSERVATIONS AND INTERACTIONS WE MIGHT DECIDE THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS PRESENT OR TO PUT THINGS DIFFERENTLY WE MIGHT ADOPT THE SORT OF ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT THAT WE NORMALLY RESERVE FOR FELLOW CONSCIOUS CREATURES

THE AUTHOR WANTS TO FORGO CLAIMS THAT THERE IS A FACT OF THE MATTER ABOUT AN ENTITY BEING CONSCIOUS INSTEAD WE ARE TO MERELY HAVE THE SORT OF ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ENTITY THAT WE NORMALLY RESERVE FOR CONSCIOUS CREATURES BUT THIS IS A MUDDLE HOW DO WE KNOW WHO OUR FELLOW CONSCIOUS CREATURES ARE IN ORDER TO ADOPT THIS ATTITUDE HIS ANSWER IS

WE SIMPLY SEE THEM THAT WAY AND TREAT THEM ACCORDINGLY DOUBT PLAYS NO PART IN OUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS THEM

I AGREE THAT WE SIMPLY JUST SEE MANY OF OUR FELLOW CONSCIOUS CREATURES THAT WAY THROUGH A KIND OF PRELINGUISTIC INTERSUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT MAYBE VIA SOME PRIMITIVE HARDWIRED EMPATHY OR SOMETHING WHAT I DON'T AGREE WITH IS THE NOTION THAT IN SEEING OUR FELLOW CONSCIOUS CREATURES AS CONSCIOUS WE DON'T ASSUME FACTS ABOUT THEIR INNER MENTAL STATES TO SEE WHY IMAGINE SEEING A PERSON YOU HAVE NEVER MET ACCIDENTALLY DROP AN ANVIL ON THEIR FOOT EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T DELIBERATE ABOUT IT YOU COME TO THE BELIEF THAT THE PERSON HAS THE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN AND THAT THIS PAIN IS ONLY DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE TO THIS PERSON YOU ARE PROBABLY FEELING AN EMPATHETIC RESIDUE SO TO SPEAK OF THE PAIN BUT YOU HAVE AN INNATE AWARENESS THAT THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL PAIN THAT BELONGS TO YOU

LET S BEGIN WITH A MODESTLY EXOTIC HYPOTHETICAL CASE A HUMANOID ROBOT WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THE ROBOT AVA FROM THE FILM EX MACHINA WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY ALEX GARLAND

LOL I LOVE HOW HE DOESN'T MENTION HE WAS A PAID SCIENCE ADVISOR ON THIS FILM AND THEN PROCEEDS TO GIVE A LONG EXCITING DESCRIPTION OF ITS PLOT THAT DOES LITTLE TO ADVANCE HIS ARGUMENT OTHER THAN TO SHOW HOW THE MAIN CHARACTER ADOPTS A KIND OF ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE BEHAVIOR OF THE AI IN QUESTION WHICH OKAY GREAT SO WHAT HE COULD STILL BE MISTAKEN ABOUT HER MENTAL STATES IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT HE BARELY MENTIONS IN HIS ANALYSIS THE POTENTIAL FOR YOU KNOW ACTUAL NEUROSCIENCE TO HELP US ATTEMPT TO BRIDGE THE EXPLANATORY GAP AND POTENTIALLY SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE THIS LACK OF FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DOING THE HARD WORK OF STUDYING ACTUAL BIOLOGICAL BRAINS IS TYPICAL OF COMPUTATIONALISTS WHO BELIEVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL SINGULARITY IS NIGH

THE TROUBLE WITH THIS THOUGHT IS THE PULL IT EXERTS TOWARDS THE SORT OF DUALISTIC METAPHYSICAL PICTURE WE ARE TRYING TO DISPENSE WITH

I ALSO LIKE THAT THOUSANDS OF WORDS INTO THIS ARTICLE AND HE STILL HASN'T PROVIDED ANY ANALYSIS OF WHAT HE TAKES TO BE THE FAILINGS OF PROPERTY DUALISM OR WHY WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO DISPENSE WITH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE IS IT ENOUGH TO JUST SAY DUALISM TO SEND US RUNNING FOR THE HILLS




THUS CONTINUES THE NAIVE CONFLATION OF INTELLIGENCE CONSCIOUSNESS AND MIND
THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT CLASSIFYING AS A SINGLE DIMENSION IS PROBLEMATIC INTELLIGENCE IS VERY MULTIFACETED AND TWO MINDS WHICH ARE EQUALLY NONHUMAN CAN BE EVEN MORE ALIEN TO ONE ANOTHER THAN THEY ARE TO US

A VERY THOROUGH SYSTEM TO DESCRIBE AND CLASSIFY MIND TYPES WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO BUILD BUT VALUABLE FOR REDUCING ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONCEPTIONS OF AI AND INSPIRING MORE COLORFUL THOUGHT ON ITS POSSIBILITIES

EDIT FURTHERMORE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A MIND IS NOT A PARTICULARLY USEFUL DIMENSION FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATES THIS WELL IF OUR GOAL IS TO DEBATE THE ETHICAL STATUS OF OTHER MINDS THEN CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE TO UNDERSTAND BUT IF WE JUST WANT TO CONCEPTUALIZE ABOUT THE SPACE OF POSSIBLE AGENTS AND HOW WE MIGHT PERCEIVE THEM IT'S IRRELEVANT

EDIT 2 AND WHAT THE HELL WHO HERE HAS AN ACTUAL REASON TO DISAGREE WITH THIS
SOME FACET OF REALITY MIGHT BE EMPIRICALLY INACCESSIBLE TO US BUT NOTHING IS HIDDEN AS A MATTER OF METAPHYSICS

IS THIS REALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF VIEWS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM IS AN EXAMPLE OF TRUTHS HIDDEN AS A MATTER OF METAPHYSICS BUT PERHAPS I MISUNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'VE ONLY LEARNED SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF WITTGENSTEIN
REMOVED
NONE OF THAT IS EVIDENT OR AS YOU SAY OBVIOUS MY RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE SUCH AS ITS ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SPACE EFFICIENCY THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES

FOR EXAMPLE TAKE A NONHUMAN INTELLIGENCE OF A COMPUTER AND SCALE IT TO THE COMPUTATIONAL POWER OF A BRAIN THE RESULT IS A SYSTEM THE SIZE OF A CITY BLOCK THAT REQUIRES SOMETHING LIKE A NUCLEAR PLANT TO POWER IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME WELL

WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR ARGUMENT OR LOGICAL PROCESS FOR YOUR CLAIMS IT SEEMS TO ME YOU JUST SAID EACH STEP OF YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS WAS OBVIOUS
I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO HAVE TO BRING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION INTO THIS BUT THIS VIDEO WOULD BE THE PERFECT INTRODUCTION TO DEBATE
SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO JULIANNE CHUNG YALE UNIVERSITY EXPLAINS THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS OF TRUTH AND VALIDITY BEFORE GOING ON TO ILLUSTRATE HOW TRUTH AND FALSITY AS WELL AS VALIDITY AND INVALIDITY CAN APPEAR IN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS IN AN ARGUMENT SHE THEN INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF A SOUND ARGUMENT I EAST A VALID ARGUMENT WHOSE PREMISES ARE ALL TRUE AND PRESENTS ONE REASON TO THINK THAT VALID ARGUMENTS WITH FALSE PREMISES ARE ALSO OF INTEREST FOR MORE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS OF VALIDITY AND SOUNDNESS PLEASE BE SURE TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE VIDEOS ON THESE TOPICS BY PAUL HENNE DUKE UNIVERSITY AND AARON ANCELL DUKE UNIVERSITY RESPECTIVELY

THANKS FOR WATCHING IF YOU LIKE OUR VIDEOS PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL

EDIT WE THE WIPHI TEAM ARE DOING AN AMA AT R PHILOSOPHY ON MONDAY FROM EST COME AND ASK US ANYTHING
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING TO TRY TO EXPLAIN VALIDITY WITHOUT USING TRUTH AS A BASIS I AM A LOGIC TUTOR AND HAVE TO SAY SEVERAL TIMES A SESSION DON'T WORRY IF IT'S TRUE OR NOT FOR RIGHT NOW AND IT JUST COMPLETELY ESCAPES UNDERSTANDING FOR SOME FOLKS I TRY TO WORK BACKWARDS WITH THEM AND ASK THEM TO ASSUME THE CONCLUSION IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE AND THEN TO ASCERTAIN WHAT TRUTH VALUE THAT WOULD GIVE THE PREMISES
HMM INTERESTING CHANNEL SUBSCRIBED
SOME SHEPHERDS JUST HAPPEN TO BE AUSTRALIAN AND ARE ALSO NOT DOGS
CAN I BE HONEST AND ASK WHY THIS IS MADE INTO A BIG DEAL IN THE END JUST USE YOUR COMMON SENSE WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE BROKEN UP LIKE THIS AS IF WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW I'M NOT HATING I JUST DON'T SEE WHY THIS TRIVIAL COGNITIVELY NATURAL CONCEPT IS TAKEN SO SERIOUSLY
IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT THE VALIDITY REFERRED TO THROUGHOUT THIS VIDEO IS OF THE GENERAL KIND RATHER THAN OF THE FORMAL KIND

BY THIS I MEAN THAT THE VERSION OF VALIDITY SHOWN AT THE START OF THE VIDEO IN 2 ISN'T THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF VALIDITY

GENERALLY YOU CANNOT ARGUE THE FOLLOWING

DOGS ARE BLUE

P2 DOGS ARE NOT BLUE

C PAPA JOHNS IS THE BEST PIZZA

THIS IS HOWEVER A FORMALLY VALID ARGUMENT IT IS NOT A GENERALLY VALID ARGUMENT

THIS IS BECAUSE THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF VALIDITY NECESSITATES THAT THERE CAN BE NO INTERPRETATION OF THE PREMISES SUCH THAT IF THEY ARE ALL TRUE THE CONCLUSION CANNOT BE UNTRUE WHAT'S FUN AND AT TIMES FRUSTRATING ABOUT THE FORMAL DEFINITION IS THAT THIS IDEA CAN BE UPHELD IN THE EVENT THAT THE INTERPRETATION OF BOTH OR MORE PREMISES BEING TRUE CAN'T BE MADE IN THE FIRST PLACE I EAST WHEN THEY ARE CONTRADICTORY

THUS OUR C CAN BE JUST ABOUT ANYTHING AND IT REMAINS VALID


HMM TRUTH TABLES
I ACCIDENTALLY READ THIS AS TRUMP AND VALIDITY
SEEMS VALID
REMOVED
ON MOBILE AND CAN'T WATCH THE VIDEO RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION IN CLASS NOTE THAT MY COMMENT IS SOLELY BASED ON THE TITLE AND MY SCIENTIFIC WORKING CLASS AND IT CAME DOWN TO THAT TRUTH IS JUST WHAT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED BY THE CURRENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE EAST G BACK THEN THE BELIEVE OF THE EARTH BEING FEAF WAS CONSIDERED AND ACCEPTED AS TRUTH SO I SUPPOSE VALIDITY JUST MEANS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE AS TRUTH BECAUSE IT IS ONLY VALID TO ACCEPT THE EARTH AS BEING ROUND NO MATTER WHETHER PEOPLE THINK IT'S TRUE OR NOT

IN THE SAME REGARD THE WORD VALIDITY IS ESSENTIALLY NOT USED CORRECTLY BECAUSE VALIDITY IN THE SENSE AS DESCRIBED HERE CAN'T BE PROVEN WITH EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE
THIS IS A BLOG POST BY ROY TENSE COOK CTA SCHOLAR OF THE COLLEGE AND PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA TWIN CITIES WHO WILL BE GIVING AN AMA HERE ON R PHILOSOPHY ON NOVEMBER SEE THE ANNOUNCEMENT POST HERE FOR MORE DETAILS BE SURE TO CHECK BACK AROUND THEN FOR LIVE Q A ON PHILOSOPHY OF LOGIC MATHEMATICS AND COMICS
MY EX WIFE STUDIED FOR HER MASTER'S UNDER HIM AT MCGILL IN THE EARLY HE WAS QUITE A CHARACTER AND HAD ASTONISHED LONG EYEBROWS
MI JUST HEARD AN EPISODE OF THE ART OF MANLINESS INTERVIEWING A GUY WHO WROTE A COMPANION READER FOR CHARLES A SECULAR AGE

I GRABBED HIS FIRST AND RELATED BOOK SOURCES OF SELF FROM THE LIBRARY TO START WITH ACE STUFF ON THE SELF AND MODERNITY
REMOVED
WE READ THE ETHICS OF AUTHENTICITY IN MY HIGH SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL STILL ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE READ TO THIS DAY
CIRC ONE OF MY PROFS STUDIED UNDER HIM FOR HIS PHD
THIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD HAS PROVED ENORMOUSLY PRODUCTIVE IN THE RISE OF MODERN SCIENCE IT HAS BEEN LIMITING IN SPIRITUAL LIFE IT HAS ALSO SHAPED AN APPROACH TO THE ENVIRONMENT AS SIMPLY A MATTER OF COST EFFECT RESOURCES AND USE AT ODDS WITH A NOTION OF MORE TRANSCENDENT VALUE I JUST CAN'T ABIDE BY THAT STATEMENT IT'S OUTRAGEOUS WE WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT TO KNOW TO PROTECT IT WITHOUT SCIENCE AND EMPIRICISM IS AN EXCELLENT BASIS ON WHICH TO VALUE OUR ENVIRONMENT THE THING WITH TRANSCENDENT VALUE IS US AND WE WILL ALL DIE IF WE DON'T TAKE BETTER CARE OF THE ROCK WE'RE SITTING ON THIS IDEA THAT THERE'S SOME USE FOR SPIRITUALITY IS VERY EASY TO TALK ABOUT AS A PHILOSOPHER BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEWHERE SPIRITUALITY HELPED AND SCIENCE AND OBJECTIVITY COULDN'T HAVE HELPED
DELETED
I RECOMMEND A READ HERE
I THINK IT'S WORTH WATCHING BUT THE VERY BEGINNING PROBABLY TURNS A LOT OF PEOPLE OFFICIAL

THE FIRST SPEAKERS CLAIMING THAT BEING AWAKE AS OBVIOUSLY BIOLOGICAL WITHOUT ANY ELABORATION MAKES HIM SEEM AS THOUGHT HE IS A PHILOSOPHER WITHOUT COMPREHENSION OF ABSTRACT CONCEPTION AND FAR MORE IGNORANT THAN I'M SURE HE REALLY IS
THE CURRENT MODEL IS THAT MATTER COMES FIRST THEN MIND THEN CONSCIOUSNESS BUT WHO HAS EVER EXPERIENCED A MIND OR MATTER WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS NOT A VERY SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSION AS FAR AS THE CURRENT MODEL IS CONCERNED
ABSTRACT

WHAT MAKES A LIFE MEANINGFUL IS THE CHOICE OF WHERE WE FIND MEANING COMPLETELY ARBITRARY THESE QUESTIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE SUSAN WOLF DISCUSSES MEANING IN LIFE IN THIS EPISODE OF THE PHILOSOPHY BITES PODCAST

INTERVIEWEE

SUSAN WOLF EDNA J KOURY DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL

PHILOSOPHY BITES

DONATE

PHILOSOPHY BITES IS A GREAT SERVICE BUT IS UNFORTUNATELY RUN ENTIRELY ON DONATIONS YOU CAN DONATE VIA PALPAL ON THE LEFT SIDEBAR OF THE PHILOSOPHY BITES SITE OR YOU CAN DONATE MONTHLY VIA THEIR PATRON PAGE
WOLF ALSO HAS A GREAT INTERVIEW ON THE VERY BAD WIZARDS PODCAST
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

READ THE POST BEFORE YOU REPLY

READ THE POSTED CONTENT UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS GIVEN AND RESPOND TO THESE SUBSTANTIVELY IF YOU HAVE UNRELATED THOUGHTS OR DON'T WISH TO READ THE CONTENT PLEASE POST YOUR OWN THREAD OR SIMPLY REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING COMMENTS WHICH ARE CLEARLY NOT IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE POSTED CONTENT MAY BE REMOVED

THIS SUB IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TANGENTIAL ANECDOTES OR DANK MEMES EXPECT COMMENT THREADS THAT BREAK OUR RULES TO BE REMOVED
DO THESE ISSUES STILL APPLY THE SAME TODAY WHO EXACTLY QUALIFIES AS AN INTELLECTUAL SEEMS TO BE THE REAL STICKING POINT THROUGHOUT CHOMSKY CALLS ACADEMICS TO STAND AGAINST THE WAR BUT IF WE LOOK AT GENERALLY DISTASTEFUL MILITARY ACTION NOW THE INTELLECTUAL RESPONSE SEEMS PRETTY ONE-SIDEDLY WITH CHOMSKY TO VARYING DEGREES UNLESS WE WANT TO INCORPORATE THINK-TANK CATO COMES TO MIND AND THE SORTS OF ANALYSTS WE SEE ON CERTAIN NEWS OUTLETS

ON THE POINT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY TOO RATHER THAN WAITING FOR OUR TECHNOLOGICAL SALVATION FROM THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS DISTRACTION HAS TAKEN OVER AS THE MODUS OPERANDI EITHER INTELLECTUALS ARE SO DEEP INTO A SUBSPECIALIZATION THEY HAVE NO INPUT ON SUCH MATTERS OR ELSE THEY ARE ACTIVELY DISMISSING THE ROLE INTELLECTUALS OUGHT TO PLAY IN SOCIAL AFFAIRS
THUS FAR NOT A SINGLE COMMENT HAS RESPONDED TO THE CONTENT OF THE PIECE THE CLOSEST ANYONE CAME WAS A SERIES OF DIGRESSIONS ON THE MORALITY OF THE NUCLEAR BOMBINGS OF HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI WE WILL CONTINUE TO REMOVE THREADS THIS ISN'T A CATCH-ALL THREAD ON CHOMSKY AND CATCH-ALL THREADS ARE DEEPLY UNPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE FOCUSED DISCUSSION OF THE OP IMPOSSIBLE
IN EITHER CASE AN ARGUMENT IS IN ORDER AND SKEPTICISM IS JUSTIFIED WHEN NONE APPEARS

THROUGHOUT THE PIECE HE'LL DROP LINES LIKE IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INTELLECTUAL TO INSIST UPON THE TRUTH AND WHAT IS REMARKABLE IS THAT SERIOUS PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THESE ABSURDITIES NO DOUBT BECAUSE OF THE FACADE OF TOUGH-MINDEDNESS AND AND BASICALLY STARTS TO HIT THE IDEA THAT THE INTELLECTUAL IS NOW CURRENCY I WANT TO TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AND SAY BRAND AS INTELLECTUALS ARE NOW A BRAND FOR CHOMSKY WE GET THE IDEA THAT INTELLECTUALS ARE PART OF THE GEARS OF POWER IN RULING THE WELFARE STATE VIA BELL BUT THAT BELL FAILS TO ASCRIBE A MORALITY OR REASON TO THESE INTELLECTUALS ESSENTIALLY CHOMSKY WROTE ALL THIS AND SAID NOTHING ANY TIMES HE SEEMED LIKE HE WOULD BREAK OFF AND SAY SOMETHING HE HAD TRICKED YOU AND WOULD GO BACK TO INTELLECTUAL NOTHINGS I GET THAT HE'S AGAINST THE WAR HE MADE SURE TO BLAST THEM SEVERAL TIMES ALONG THE WAY BUT HONESTLY HE NEVER REALLY FINISHED MAKING HIS CASE ABOUT WHAT ROLE INTELLECTUALS HAD AT LEAST FOR ME TO FEEL HE HAD JUSTIFIED HIS POINT I FEEL THE TITLE SHOULD OF BEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF INTELLECTUALS

NOW PEOPLE WANT TO SELL BOOKS AND GET TV SHOWS AND PODCASTS BEING THE LEVERS OF THE WELFARE STATE IS DEFINITELY NOT ON MIND I MEAN GOOGLE EXISTS SO IF PEOPLE REALLY WANTED TO LEARN ABOUT BEING GOOD PEOPLE THEY CAN LOOK IT UP WHY SHOULD I REALLY SPEND MY TIME SOLVING PROBLEMS FOR YOU

I SUPPOSE THE MOST PERTINENT QUESTION TO ASK CHOMSKY IS IF ANY NATION HAS EVER BEEN TRULY ALTRUISTIC IN ITS INTERVENTION HIS ARGUMENT SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT INTERVENTION INVARIABLY REMOVES THE POSSIBILITY OF ALTRUISM IN WHICH CASE I'D THEN HAVE TO ASK SO THEN WHAT'S YOUR POINT NOAM THAT THE WORLD ISN'T PERFECT

HE NEVER MUCH MENTIONS WHAT HE CONSIDERS A BAR OF SUCCESS THOUGH HE CERTAINLY GOES ON AND ON ABOUT WHAT ISN'T SUCCESS IS HE WRITING FOR SHERLOCK HOLMES OR DOES HE SIMPLY NOT HAVE THE ANSWER MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT IT'S THE LATTER POKING HOLES AND FINDING ERROR IS TOO EASY AND DOING SO DOES NOT MAKE YOU AN INTELLECTUAL INTELLECTUALS ARE SUCH BECAUSE THEIR END PRODUCTS ARE IDEAS SO SAYS THOMAS SOWELL SO WHAT'S END FOREIGN POLICY PRODUCT

A LARGE PORTION OF HIS ARGUMENT HINGES ON A PARAPHRASING OF KISSINGER ON PAGE WHICH ROUGHLY SUGGESTS THAT KISSINGER IS DISTURBED THAT OTHERS QUESTION NOT OUR JUDGMENT BUT OUR MOTIVES CHOMSKY SEEMS TO PURPOSELY MISINTERPRET KISSINGER HERE INSINUATING THAT KISSINGER FEELS HIS MOTIVES ARE NOT TO BE QUESTIONED WHAT I BELIEVE KISSINGER MEANT WAS THAT HE'S DISAPPOINTED THAT SO MANY CHOMSKY INCLUDED CHOSE TO VIEW HIS MOTIVES TO KEEP IT SIMPLE THOSE BEING ALTRUISTIC AS DISINGENUOUS OR WORSE A COVER FOR SOMETHING DARK AND EXPLOITIVE JUST BECAUSE THE EVENTUAL ENDS MIGHT NOT BE GOOD OR ARE LESS THAN GOOD DOES NOT MEAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT HAS BEEN REVEALED THIS SORT OF MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKING COMES OFF AS INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST AT ONE POINT CHOMSKY LABELS ANSWERS AS WRONG IN ALL CASES ON THIS SUBJECT OF MOTIVES YET WHICH PRECEDING IN THAT SAME SENTENCE CHOMSKY STATES ATTITUDE PRESUPPOSES ANSWERS IN OTHER WORDS CHOMSKY IS LITERALLY PROJECTING MOTIVATION ONTO SOMEONE BASED ON HIS OWN BELIEFS AND BIASES I WOULD NEVER LOSE AN ARGUMENT IF I WAS ALLOWED TO PUT WORDS IN THE MOUTHS OF MY OPPONENTS EITHER

I CAN'T HELP BUT SEE HOW BINARY WORLD-VIEW WAS IN THE AND PERHAPS STILL TO THIS DAY THE MISQUOTES THE MISINTERPRETATIONS RENDERING HIS OPPONENTS AS CARICATURES OF THEMSELVES IS TOO SELF-SERVING TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY PARTICULARLY WHEN MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS END WITH PHRASES SUCH AS THESE FACTS SEEM TOO OBVIOUS TO REQUIRE EXTENDED DISCUSSION I CAN'T IMAGINE THE KIND OF GIGGLE MY COLLEGE PROFESSOR WOULD GET OUT OF READING SUCH AN ARROGANT STATEMENT FROM A STUDENT'S PAPER THIS IS BUT ONE EXAMPLE OF THE MANY WHERE I SCRIBBLED DOWN NEXT TO THE TEXT SAYS WHO YOU NOAM AS MOST OF THE TIME THESE ARGUMENTS LACK ANY PROPER SUBSTANTIATION

LASTLY BY CHOICE BECAUSE WHO NEEDS A WORD REDDIN RESPONSE CHOMSKY SEEMS TO EXHIBIT A SINCERELY IGNORANT I SAY THAT LITERALLY NOT AS AN ATTACK LACK OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ARMS RACE AND PROXY WARS THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THE COLD WAR GIVEN HIS POLITICAL AND GENERAL ANTI-AMERICAN BELIEFS IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE DOWNPLAYS THE ISSUES OF THAT TIME THAT'S WHY MILITARY GENERALS ARE GENERALLY NOT IDEALISTS AND FOR GOOD REASON

WHEN I READ CHOMSKY I COME AWAY THINKING THAT HIS MASTERY OF THE LANGUAGE IS BETTER SERVED IN VERBAL FORM DURING DEBATE NOT WRITTEN IN WRITTEN FORM WITH NO ONE AROUND TO POKE HOLES IN HE'S FORCED TO OFFER COUNTER ARGUMENTS AND IDEAS YET STILL EVEN IN WRITING WHERE A BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END IS REQUIRED HE IGNORES THE END THAT MAKES IT A RANT NOT AN ARGUMENT

CHOMSKY DOES A LOT OF ASSUMING AND VERY LITTLE EXPLAINING ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE ARTICLE NOTABLY HE ASSUMES THAT THERE EXISTS A CLASS OF PERSONS CALLED INTELLECTUALS 2 THAT MORAL RESPONSIBILITY EXTENDS BEYOND ONE'S SELF THAT NUCLEAR WAR IS AMONG MANKIND'S WORST CRIMES AND THAT ONE HAS A MORAL OBLIGATION TO TELL TRUTH

LET'S START WITH THAT THERE EXISTS A CLASS OF PERSONS WHO CAN BE CONSIDERED INTELLECTUALS WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPOSE GOVERNMENT LIES ANALYZE ACTIONS AND THIS POWER IS RELATED TO WESTERN POLITICAL FREEDOM WHILE I CANNOT SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN THE I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN THE MODERN WORLD THERE REALLY ARE NO INTELLECTUALS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SMART BUT THEY TEND TO HAVE SPECIALIZATIONS THE ERA OF THE RENAISSANCE MAN IS LARGELY OVER CONVERSELY WITH THE ADVENT OF THE INTERNET EVERYONE IS AN EXPERT ON EVERYTHING NO INFORMATION WHICH IS KNOWN TO INTELLECTUALS IS STUCK IN THE IVORY TOWER ALL ACADEMIC JOURNALS BOOKS KNOWLEDGE IS AVAILABLE TO ALL AS SUCH THERE CANNOT EXIST A RESPONSIBILITY ON INTELLECTUALS WHICH DOESN'T EXIST ON THE PUBLIC AT LARGE IF ONLY BECAUSE THE DISTRIBUTION OF KNOWLEDGE PREVENTS SUCH A CLASS OF PERSONS FROM EXISTING IN MODERN TIMES

2 WHILE THERE EXIST MORAL SYSTEMS WHICH REQUIRE ONE TO THINK BEYOND ONE'S OWN SKIN THERE ARE PLENTY OF MORAL SYSTEMS WHICH ALLOW FOR ONE TO EFFECTIVELY LIVE IN A BUBBLE THEREFORE THIS CLAIM FALLS TOTALLY FLAT

EVEN IN THE OPENING TO THE PAPER CHOMSKY LISTS PLENTY OF CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY YET HE PROVIDES NO REASONING OR RATIONALE FOR WHY NUCLEAR BOMBING OF JAPAN MAKES THE TOP OF THE LIST IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT IT MAY HAVE STILL BE RECENT IN MEMORY BUT SO WERE MANY OTHER ELEMENTS HE LISTED HUMAN HISTORY IS FILLED WITH TRAGEDY AND I SEE NO REASON TO PRESUME HIROSHIMA IS IN THE TOP NOR DOES CHOMSKY GIVE US ONE

CHOMSKY ARGUES THAT INTELLECTUALS HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO SPEAK HONESTLY AND SPEAK TRUTHFULLY ON ITS FACE THIS CAN BE DISMISSED AS EASILY AS THE SECOND POINT YES THERE ARE MORAL SYSTEMS WHICH REQUIRE HONESTY BUT THERE ARE OTHER MORAL SYSTEMS WHICH DON'T MORE IMPORTANTLY CHOMSKY SEEMS TO BE NEGLECTING HIS OWN PURPOSES THE THRUST OF HIS ARGUMENT IS THAT INTELLECTUALS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC IF THE GOAL IS TO ACT IN THE PUBLIC GOOD IF THE GOAL IS TO KEEP OUR NATION AND ALL NATIONS SAFE AND FREE FROM MASSIVE HUMAN SUFFERING LIES ARE AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL TOOL TO DOING SO BLUFFS EXAGGERATIONS HYPERBOLE ALL HAVE VALUE IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE AND TO ENTIRELY DISMISS THAT IS TO MISS THE MARK

I COULD KEEP GOING BUT THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET AN DISCUSSION STARTED

SOUNDS MORE LIKE GIVING PSEUDO OR WOULD-BE INTELLECTUALS AN INFLATED SENSE OF IMPORTANCE ALL THESE HIGHBROW TERMS LIKE TRUTH AND JUSTICE FOR THESE WAKE UP SHEEPLET INDIVIDUALS TO THROW AROUND AND FEEL SUPERIOR TO THOSE AROUND THEM AS IF THEY ARE IRONCLAD CONCEPTS WHOSE MORALITY IS INHERENTLY UNASSAILABLE

EVEN PLATO ARGUED THAT THE TRUTH DOES NOT ALWAYS NEED TO BE TOLD SOMETIMES EXPOSING A LIE CAN DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD TELLING YOUR FRIEND THE TRUTH ABOUT THEIR GOD-AWFUL HAIRCUT BECAUSE OF SOME MISGUIDED DEDICATION AND INTELLECTUAL RESPONSIBILITY TO TRUTH MIGHT VERY WELL LOSE YOU A FRIEND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE MUCH MUCH MORE SERIOUS MATTERS THAN THIS IN WHICH THE TRUTH COULD BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT DOES THAT MAKE IT AN INHERENTLY GOOD THING DOES THAT MAKE IT THE ULTIMATE IDEAL THAT SO MANY INTELLECTUALS SEEM TO CLING TO IN OTHER WORDS YOUR PHILOSOPHERS WERE SO BUSY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY COULD THAT THEY DIDN'T STOP TO THINK IF THEY SHOULD

I AM NOT DEFENDING LYING ONLY THAT THESE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE CALLING UPON THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY CRITICAL THINKERS TO UPHOLD AN IDEAL WITHOUT THINKING CRITICALLY
DEFINE RESPONSIBILITY

DUTY LEGAL LIABILITY MORAL RESPONSIBILITY LEGAL OBLIGATION PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
SAINT CHOMSKY THE POPE OF US LEFTISM WILL APPEAR IN OLD SOUTH CHURCH ON OCT AT AS ALWAYS HE'S BRILLIANT
DIDN'T THIS GUY NOAM CHOMSKY RAPE LIKE WOMAN
IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF INTELLECTUALS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AND TO EXPOSE LIES

UNFORTUNATELY JUST AN OPINION
A VERBOSE INFORMAL ESSAY ON THE CIVIL NATURE OF OPEN POSITIONS AND HOW THEY FOSTER POWER THROUGH UNITING AND ENGAGING THE POPULOUS


IN RULES OF ORDER SECONDING IS APPLIED IN A VERY STERILIZED FASHION ALMOST AS A FORMAL GREETING EXCEPT ON THE RARE OCCASIONS WHERE IT'S USED TO NOT ADDRESS AN ISSUE IN A PUBLIC FORUM THERE IS AN ORGANIC OUTWORKING OF THIS HUMAN BEHAVIOR WHEN AN IDEA IS BROUGHT UP THERE ARE USUALLY COUNTERPOINTS THAT IT CALLS OUT AS LAW HIGHLIGHTS THESE DISSENTING OPINIONS ARE USUALLY PREMATURE AS KNEE JERK REACTIONS THOUGH BEFORE DEBATE THE ISSUE NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED AS VALID OR THE FORUM WOULD BE INUNDATED BY WHIMSY THERE'S A THING HUMANS DO WHERE SOMEONE WILL AGREE WITH A TOPIC AND RESTATE IT FROM THEIR PROSPECTIVE THIS HELPS IMPRESS THE IDEA VIA REPETITION BUT ALSO PUTS IS IN A SECOND SOMETIMES MORE SALIENT OR ATTRACTIVE WAY THERE ARE THEN TWO OPINIONS BACKING THE POINT AND THERE CAN BE INTERNAL DISCOURSE ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE IT FOR CONSIDERATION WHEN IT IS QUESTIONED THIS VETTING PROCESS SIDELINES INTERESTS THAT ARE NOT PERTINENT

A SEPARATE COUNCIL IS SOMETIMES ADOPTED IN THE MODEL TO REGULATE THE INTAKE OF TOPICS SO AS NOT TO BE OVERLOADED BY THEM WHEN THIS HAPPENS PEOPLE REGULATE THEIR POWER TO REPRESENTATIVES JUDGED TO BE WORTHY AS A JUDGE SYSTEMS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN DEEMED SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEIR FOUNDERS ARE CONTENT TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ELSEWHERE AS THERE ARE PROFESSIONALS IN CHARGE OF OPERATIONS THIS PROFESSIONAL BODY THEN ATTRACTS THOSE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS AS TIME PASSES THE SMALL COUNCIL BECOMES MORE PRACTICED AT RAISING ISSUES AS THE POPULOUS PRACTICE AND THEN SKILL ATROPHIES THE PROBLEM MANIFESTS ITSELF WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL SEEKS TO TABLE AN ISSUE BUT IS MARGINALIZED AS THE PROFESSIONALS SUBSTITUTE THEIR BIAS INTERESTS WHETHER PURPOSEFULLY OR NOT IN PLACE OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST

AS OUR VESTED AGENTS THE PUBLIC ARE THE PATRONS OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS INDIVIDUALS FIND IT INEFFECTIVE TO SPONSOR A REPRESENTATIVE BEYOND SIMPLE FINANCIAL SUPPORT WHICH FOR EXAMPLE LAWYERS ARE KNOWN TO EXCHANGE THEIR SUPPORT FOR IT IS AN ISSUE OF LACKING STANDING AS THE VOICE OF ONLY ONE WHEN A COMMUNITY SUPPORTS A REPRESENTATIVE THEIR COMBINED FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS EXPECTED TO BE AS POTENT AS THEIR COMBINED VOICE IS THE TWO ARE NOT THE SAME AND IT IS DETRIMENTAL TO ACT ON THAT PREMISE WHICH REINFORCES THE PROBLEM TO DEMOCRACY

AS THE GOVERNMENT PURPORTS TO AND INDEED DOES ACT FOR ALL CITIZENS ALL CITIZENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A VOICE ARE NEEDED TO BE REPRESENTED TO VALIDATE SUCH GOVERNANCE THOSE ARTIFICIALLY INVALIDATED VOICES WILL THEN ONLY BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN AN INVALID FASHION THAT EXPRESSION WILL BE INVALID TO THE SAME DEGREE THAT THEIR POTENCY IS UNWARRANTEDLY RESTRICTED IF A COLLECTIVE PRIVATE INTEREST BECOMES LARGE ENOUGH TO SPONSOR PUBLIC AGENTS THE PRICE RISES AND EVENTUALLY BECOMES OUT OF REACH AS PUBLIC FINANCES FLOW INCREASINGLY INTO THAT CONGLOMERATE AND LESS INTO THE PUBLIC COFFERS LOGARITHMIC WEALTH ACCUMULATION FOLLOWS AS THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNS FINANCIAL REGULATIONS

THE DIRECTION OF PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVES THEN IS DICTATED BY THE BIAS DECISIONS OF UNREPRESENTATIVE GROUPS OF THOSE THAT HAVE TOO MUCH INSTEAD OF IN THE COMMON GOOD INCLUDING BOTH THE WEALTHY AND THOSE THAT HAVE TOO LITTLE AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE CLASSICAL UNLESS AN INDIVIDUAL IS A MEMBER OF THE GROUP THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM SPONSORING PUBLIC REPRESENTATIVES IN SUCH A FASHION THEIR SUPPORT FOR THEM IN SUCH A SYSTEM WHERE THEY USURP PUBLIC POWER IS AGAINST THEIR INTERESTS IN THE LONG RUN IMBALANCE WILL BE TO THE DETERMENT OF THE PUBLIC EVEN IF A FEW INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TRANSITION THROUGH REFORM ONCE THEY DEEM THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BUFFET THEMSELVES FROM SUCH A STORM

ADDRESSING SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS SUCH AS CORRUPTION REQUIRES THAT THE PUBLIC INTERESTS BE ALLOWED TO BE VOICED AND REPRESENTED DESPITE CORRUPT SYSTEMIC BIAS OR AN ENTRENCHED PATHOLOGICAL CULTURE THIS IS WHEN IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC HAVE RECOURSE IF THE COUNCILS THAT DECIDE APPROVAL MARGINALIZE THEM AS UNREPRESENTED AMATEURS THIS IMPORTANT TASK OVERSIGHT OF DISENFRANCHISEMENT AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH CIVIL RECOURSE IS PERMITTED NO LONGER TRUSTED IN A BROKEN SYSTEM THE GOAL THEREFORE TO AVOID REQUIRING REVOLUTION IS TO FOSTER CONTINUAL ENGAGEMENT OF CIVIL CIVIC DUTIES SO THAT UNCIVIL ONES ARE NOT CONSIDERED A VALID PATHOLOGY

IT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE COMMON GOOD TO HAVE PRIVATE OPINIONS AND PUBLIC ONES ONLY COMMON ONES AND RARE PERSONAL ONES THAT DIFFER BUT ARE PUBLICLY KNOWN TO ALLOW EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT IF THERE MIGHT BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OTHERWISE AGREEMENTS AND SUPPORT ARE WASTED ON FRAUDULENT FACADES AND IN FACT WORK AGAINST THOSE VERY PURPOSES SKILL IS PENULTIMATE TO TRUST THAT THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE A FAIR VOICE IN POLITICS BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THAT SKILL TENDS TO BE USED FOR PRIVATE PURPOSES

THAT IS WHY I LIKE THE TOPIC OF TRANSPARENCY IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER TRUST SUPPORT ACCESS VOICE VALIDITY AND THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION THANK YOU ALL FOR EXERCISING YOUR VOICES AND NOT ALLOWING THEM TO ATROPHY THEIR POTENCY IN THE SYSTEM OF PUBLIC GOVERNANCE CONSTITUENTS CAN HARDLY ACCESS THE LOBBY OF THEIR PUBLIC OFFICES WHILE THE WEALTHY HAVE NEARLY SOLE ACCESS TO THE LOBBY AND THEREFORE THE OFFICE
IN A RECENTLY REVEALED DOCUMENT HILLARY CLINTON SAID TO A GROUP OF REAL ESTATE INVESTORS YOU NEED BOTH A PUBLIC AND PRIVATE POSITION EARLIER IN THE YEAR DURING A HIGHLY PAID SPEECH FOR EXECUTIVES AT DEUTSCHE BANK HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT SHE DREAMS OF A HEMISPHERIC COMMON MARKET WITH OPEN TRADE AND OPEN BORDERS JUST LAST WEEK SPEAKING TO UNEMPLOYED AND MARGINALIZED AMERICAN WORKERS HILLARY CLINTON SAID THAT SHE OPPOSES THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP HEMISPHERIC COMMON MARKET WITH FREE TRADE AND OPEN BORDERS AND SHE WILL PROTECT AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AND JOBS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THIS WE SITUATE PUBLIC PRIVATE VIEWS IN THE HISTORICAL AND DEEPER THEORETICAL CONTEXT OF THE PRINCE CAUTION THIS IS DARK STUFF YOU MAY NOT LIKE WHAT YOU HEAR ENJOY
MORAL PHILOSOPHY DEPENDS ON THE EXISTENCE OF TRANSCENDENTAL FREE WILL WHICH HE READILY ADMITS WE CAN'T KNOW SO THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE WAS NEVER VALID A PRIORI IN THE FIRST PLACE UNLESS THAT ASSUMPTION IS MADE I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN THE SAME WAY THOUGH WE CAN NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT ANYTHING IN OUR FIELD OF APPEARANCE IS A RATIONAL AGENT OTHER THAN OURSELVES WE CAN MAKE ANOTHER ASSUMPTION THAT THE HUMANS AROUND US ARE RATIONAL AGENTS LIKE US HE'S RIGHT THAT THE VALIDITY OF THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE CAN'T BE SHOWN A PRIORI BUT THAT ISN'T A SURPRISE
PERFECT READ THAT HELPS WITH A CURRENT PROBLEM OF MINE CHEERS FOR THE SHARE
ABSTRACT

SIMON BLACKBURN GIVES A TALK ON THE NOTION OF TRUTH AND SOME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES AS WELL AS THE POSTMODERN CLIMATE ACCORDING TO ONE KIND OF VIEW OUR BELIEFS OR STATEMENTS ARE TRUE INSOFAR AS THEY MIRROR OR CORRESPOND TO AN INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL REALITY OTHERS UNDERSTAND THE NOTION OF TRUTH DIFFERENTLY AS AN INTERNAL COHERENCE OF FITTING WITH OTHER BELIEFS OR ALTERNATIVELY AS WHAT SIMPLY WORKS A USEFUL TOOL FOR COPING WITH THE WORLD COPING NOT COPYING AS RICHARD RORTY LIKED TO SAY SINCE HE REJECTED THE NOTION OF REPRESENTATION ALTOGETHER HOWEVER EACH OF THESE KINDS OF THEORIES HAS ITS OWN SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN OPPOSITION TO BOTH ABSOLUTISM AND RELATIVISM BLACKBURN PRESENTS A MINIMALIST OR DEFLATIONARY VIEW WHICH FALLS WITHIN THE PRAGMATIST TRADITION HE ALSO SPENDS MUCH TIME DISCUSSING THE WORK OF RICHARD RORTY
THERE IS NO REASON WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND RELATIVE TRUTH

WIKI
PRETTY MUCH ANY EPISODE OF RICK MORTY THE HUMOR DERIVES A LOT OF ITS CORE COMEDY FROM A NIHILISTIC VIEW OF LIFE THE NEVER ENDING EXPANSE OF THE UNIVERSE AND THE TINY PLEASURES THAT WE TEND TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT CAN KEEP US AFLOAT IN ITS DIRE VOID
IN GENERAL DISCUSSION PIECES ARE A LOT STRONGER IF YOU TRY TO ANTICIPATE OBJECTIONS PEOPLE MAY HAVE TO YOUR POSITION AND GIVE RESPONSES TO THESE OBJECTIONS I RECOMMEND YOU DO THAT NOW AND POST IT AS A COMMENT OR EDIT IT INTO YOUR TEXT
IF YOU EXCLUDE THE FACT THAT LAUGHTER HAS BEEN FOUND TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN REINFORCING SOCIAL GROUPS WHICH ARE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL TO HUMAN SURVIVAL THEN PHILOSOPHY MAKES SENSE LAUGHTER IS NOT SOME EPHEMERAL IT IS A SOCIAL MECHANISM DEVELOPED OVER MILLENNIA OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

KIDNEY VOUCHERS SUGGESTED AS THE SOLUTION TO AN ORGAN MARKET BEING MANIPULATED TO THE DETRIMENT OF LOWER INCOME PEOPLE NO ONE IS GOING TO FUND KIDNEY VOUCHERS ARGUMENT FAILS

2 DOG AS A COUNTEREXAMPLE TO THE SYMBOLIC OBJECTION THE VALUE OF THE DOG IS NOT FLAT OVER TIME IT ACCRUES PERSONAL VALUE INVESTED INTO THE RELATIONSHIP YOU'RE ALSO NOT REALLY PURCHASING THE DOG MOST OF THE TIME YOU'RE PAYING SOMEONE FOR THE MEDICAL CARE IT RECEIVED DURING BREEDING REGISTERING VACCINATION ETC THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN WITH SEX OR KIDNEYS DOESN'T DISPROVE THE SYMBOLIC OBJECTION HE FOLLOWS UP ON COUNTEREXAMPLES WITH CULTURAL DIFFERENCES INSINUATING SUBJECTIVE MORALITY MEANS MONETIZING SOMETHING IS SOMEHOW A COMMON MORALITY MONEY CAN BE TREATED AS SUBJECTIVE VALUE IF AND ONLY IF IT'S DECOUPLED FROM BASIC HUMAN NEEDS THERE'S AN ASYMPTOTIC LOWER LIMIT WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL BECOMES INFINITELY DESPERATE AND SUPPLY DEMAND BREAKS DOWN THEN HE TAKES IT A STEP FURTHER AND SUGGESTS THAT BECAUSE DIFFERENT CULTURES HAVE DIFFERENT VALUES THAT INCLUDE MONETIZING DIFFERENT THINGS IT MEANS IT'S OK FOR EVERYONE HE'S BASICALLY ARGUING THAT FINDING THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR THAT ALLOWS US TO TRADE THINGS IMMORALLY IS PREFERABLE THIS IS A LOADED QUESTION TO ME HE'S CLAIMING NOTHING IS IMMORAL AND USING THAT TO PROVE THAT IT'S NOT IMMORAL

MARKETS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MANIPULATION LEGAL AND ILLEGAL HE SUGGESTS WE COULD REGULATE THIS AWAY BUT PRACTICE SHOWS THAT'S EASIER SAID THAN DONE AND AGAIN MUCH OF THAT MANIPULATION IS PERFECTLY LEGAL IF I WANT TO I COULD BUY ALL THE KIDNEYS AND SQUANDER THEM OR SELL THEM TO LABS INSTEAD OF PATIENTS WHO NEED THEM CURRENTLY LOSING A KIDNEY IS WORTH PROVIDING SOMEONE A KIDNEY IF WE INTRODUCE SELLING THEM FOR OTHER GOODS AND SERVICES WE INTRODUCE PROFIT AND WASTE TO TRADING HUMAN LIVES REST ASSURED ENTIRE INDUSTRIES WILL SPRING UP SKIMMING A LITTLE OFF THE TOP OF THESE SALES 3RD PARTIES ARE INCENTIVIZED TO REMOVE KIDNEYS WHETHER OR NOT THEY END UP SAVING A LIFE

THE TAX ON BULLSHIT ARGUMENT IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE EQUATION AND THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS PUNISHED FOR BEING WRONG DOESN'T MAKE THE PRACTICE JUST OR GOOD IT STILL INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE EVENT BEING BET FOR AGAINST IT UNNECESSARILY INTRODUCES A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHICH IS TIED TO SOCIAL STATUS AND A PERSON'S VERY LIVELIHOOD

THE ROOT OF THE IT'S JUST WRONG TO PURCHASE X ARGUMENT IS NOT ANY OF HIS PARTIAL EXAMPLES BUT IT'S A BROKEN QUESTION IN MANY WAYS HE ALMOST GETS TO THIS BUT THEN DIVERGES INTO SUPERFICIAL EXAMPLES OF SOMEONE GAINING CONTROL OVER ANOTHER WITHIN A TRADE CONTRACT

WE CAN PUT A PRICE ON MANNERS

WESTERNERS SHOULD CHANGE IN THE SAME WAY THIS MUMBLED TRIBE HAS MONETIZED THEIR FUNERAL RIGHTS BULLSHIT HE'S HOCKING HIS OWN MORALITY AND CHERRY PICKING TINY EXAMPLES TO SUPPORT IT I'M NOT PERSUADED AND I DOUBT ANY OTHER MAJOR CULTURE WILL BE EITHER FURTHER I WOULD ARGUE THAT LIKE ANY OTHER POLICY OR ISM TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING IS BAD JUST BECAUSE MARKETS DO WONDERS FOR SOME COMMODITIES AND FACILITATE TRADE DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD TRADE MORALITY IT OPENS UP SO MUCH CORRUPTION AND CODIFIES IT INTO OUR CULTURE WHICH ARE TWO POINTS HE HIGHLIGHTED AT THE BEGINNING BUT FAILED TO ADDRESS EXCEPT BY HAND WAVING

THE ARGUMENT IS INTERESTING BUT UNSUPPORTED AND UNENLIGHTENED IN MY OPINION

MONETIZING MORALITY MAY WORK IN ONLY TWO SITUATIONS I CAN THINK OF

MONEY IS DECOUPLED FROM A SET OF GOODS SERVICES UPON WHICH A HEALTHY HUMAN LIFE DEPENDS FOOD WATER SHELTER HEALTHCARE EDUCATION THAT REMOVES THE INFINITE DEMAND WHICH COULD BE LEVERAGED TO EXTRACT PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND COMPROMISED MORALITY UNDER EFFECTIVE THREAT OF SUFFERING AND DEATH LAUNDERED THROUGH CURRENCY IF MONEY IS COMPLETELY DISCRETIONARY MARKETS COULD FUNCTION IF NOT THE INFINITE DEMAND FLOOR CONSTRAINS A PERSON'S FREEDOM

2 A COMPLETE NANNY STATE WITH HEAVY PRICE FIXING AND REGULATION TO PREVENT CORRUPTION AGAIN THIS IS A FORFEITURE OF FREEDOM AND IT IS LARGELY INEFFICIENT TO FUND SUCH OVERSIGHT

BETTER TO LEAVE MORALITY TO PERSONAL JUDGEMENT DISCRETION INSTEAD OF INTRODUCING CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND MORE CONTROL OVER PERSONAL MORALITY SCALED BY WEALTH

THIS ARGUMENT IS TANTAMOUNT TO LEGALIZING BRIBERY AND ALLOWING THINGS LIKE VOTES TO BE BOUGHT DIRECTLY AT MARKET PRICE PER HEAD THIS UNDERMINES JUSTICE ITSELF AND CORRUPTS INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM FOR THE GOOD OF THE MARKET
I AGREE WITH A LOT OF THIS VIDEO I FELL AS THOUGH A LOT OF ATTACKS ON COMMODIFICATION CAPITALISM FREE TRADE ETC ARE PROBLEMS WE CAN FIX WITHOUT DESTROYING THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE FOR INSTANCE FREE TRADE ISN'T BAD BUT EXPLOITATION OF NATIVE PEOPLE IN UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES IS THE TARGET THEN SHOULD BE TO WRITE HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES AND ENFORCE THAT NOT TO KILL FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS FOR THE HELL OF IT THE DISTINCTION HERE IS FREE-TRADE BECOMES THE BAD GUY WHEN BY DEFINITION IT JUT ALLOWS GOODS AND THE THINGS PEOPLE NEED TO BE ACCESSED MORE EASILY
WHAT AN UTTERLY VILE PERSON SISTER MUST HAVE BEEN TO DECLARE HERSELF HER BROTHER'S EDITOR ONLY TO ALTER HIS POSITIONS ON SOMETHING HE FELT SO STRONGLY ABOUT KNOWING HOW STRONGLY HE ACTUALLY FELT ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE A MORE CONTEMPTIBLE THING TO DO TO A PHILOSOPHER AFTER HE LOST HIS FACULTIES LET ALONE ONE'S OWN BROTHER
SO COULD SOMEONE CHECK OUT THIS POST AND TELL ME WHETHER IVE GOT THIS RIGHT I DONT KNOW THIS STUFF WELL AND NIETZSCHE TAKES A LOT OF BACKGROUND TO DISCUSSION


THE ARTICLE DEVELOPED MY UNDERSTANDING OF NIETZSCHE PRIEST FIGURE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN GREEK CONCEPTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAN AND THE DIVINE


I HAD UNDERSTOOD THE NIETZSCHEAN PRIEST TO REPRESENT THE FORCES THAT EXPLOIT AND PARASITIZE THE RESENTMENTS OF THE WEAK TO GAIN A MODICUM OF POWER POWER THAT PRIESTLY TYPES CAN'T ACHIEVE THROUGH MORE WHOLESOME EXPRESSIONS OF ONE'S PERSONAL WILL DUE TO INTRINSIC LACK OF GREATNESS


IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE PRIESTLY SOCIETAL NICHE IS UNDERWRITTEN BY A WORSHIPFUL SUBMISSIVE RELATIONSHIP TO THE DIVINE AS OPPOSED TO THE GREEK STRUGGLE TO BECOME LIKE THE DIVINE PEOPLE WHO ARE NATURALLY GREAT WOULD SEEM TO EMBODY THAT GREEK SPIRITUAL APPROACH WHILE PEOPLE WHO LACK THIS INNER STRENGTH WOULD ABUSE THE JUDAIC PRIESTLY APPROACH TO SIPHON POWER OFF OF THE WORSHIPFUL NATURE OF THE UNDERCLASS



REMOVED
FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE BOTH OF THESE BELIEFS ARE EQUALLY USEFUL AND THEREFORE THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THE TRUE BELIEF WOULD BE SELECTED FOR


IF YOU ADMIT THIS MUCH WHY THINK THAT THE MECHANISM WHICH PRODUCED THOSE BELIEFS WOULD TEND TOWARD TRUE RATHER THAN FALSE BELIEFS

PLANTING WOULD CERTAINLY DISAGREE THAT WE NEED TO IMAGINE BELIEFS EVOLVING PIECEMEAL TO MAINTAIN HIS ARGUMENT SINCE THERE IS NO REASON FOR A GENERAL EVOLUTIONARY NEURAL MECHANISM TO REGARD THE TRUE OVER THE FALSE SO LONG AS THE NEURAL NETWORK LEADS TO THE CORRECT KIND OF BEHAVIOR
PLANTING DOESN'T SPEAK IN HIS ARGUMENT ABOUT USEFUL VS NOT USEFUL BELIEFS EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTIVE VS NOT ADAPTIVE RATHER HE THINKS OF ADAPTIVE NOT ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOURS

THE DIFFERENCE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS LONG AS THE BEHAVIOUR IS ADAPTIVE IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR EVOLUTION IF THIS ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOUR IS ASSOCIATED WITH A TRUE OR FALSE BELIEF BELIEFS WOULD BECOME IN A WAY IRRELEVANT

THEREFORE THE CONSEQUENCE OF UNDERMINING WITH THESE PREMISES ANY JUSTIFIED TRUST IN OUR COGNITIVE FACULTIES DEFINED AS THE CAPABILITY OF FORMING TRUE BELIEFS
WHAT BOTHERS ME MOST IN THE ARGUMENT IS THE SUGGESTION THAT IF NOT FOR EVOLUTION WE SHOULD TRUST OUR MENTAL FACULTIES BUT WE MAKE MISTAKES ALL THE TIME THE EXISTENCE OF INCOMPATIBLE RELIGIONS IS PROOF ENOUGH THERE IS AMPLE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT OUR MENTAL FACULTIES ARE FALLIBLE THERE'S NO NEED FOR EVOLUTION TO SEE THAT

EVOLUTION ON THE OTHER HAND IS COMPATIBLE WITH A FALLIBLE REASON THAT IS OFTEN CAPABLE OF GRASPING APPROXIMATIONS OF TRUTH

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF A PHILOSOPHER OF SCIENCE

HOW DOES QUANTUM MECHANICS CONTRADICT COMMON SENSE

CAN YOU GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

HOW MIGHT WE ESTABLISH THE TRUTH OF STRING THEORY

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST PREVALENT MISINTERPRETATIONS OF SCIENCE TODAY

HOW IS OUR EVERYDAY NOTION OF TIME FLAWED

THE PROBLEM OF TIME THAT HE POSES AT THE END DOESN'T SEEM VERY SOLID THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT ABOUT WATCHING A VIDEO OF A PERSON AGING IN REVERSE IS OBVIOUS TO US ONLY BECAUSE WE CARRY WITH US THE CONTEXT OF HOW HUMANS AGE OR IF WE WERE TO WATCH A PIECE OF PAPER BEING BURNED AND THAT'S THE ONLY INFORMATION WE HAD WE COULD ONLY EVER WATCH THE FILM IN REVERSE WE COULD VERY EASILY EXPLAIN AWAY THE FIRE AS A BUNCH OF SMOKE BEING PULLED TOGETHER BY SOME ATTRACTIVE FORCE AND AFTER TIME THE SMOKE CONDENSES SO MUCH THAT IT FREEZES TO FORM PAPER WE COULD CONTINUE TO WATCH THE FILM IN REVERSE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PAPER'S RECONFIGURATION FROM PAPER TO TREE AND EVEN FURTHER TO WATCH THE TREE'S ROOTS EJECT CARBON BACK INTO THE GROUND AND PHOTONS BACK UP INTO THE SKY AND SUDDENLY WE'VE RECREATED A SYSTEM THAT RESEMBLES ENTROPY PHOTONS AND ATOMS SHOOTING ALL UP AND AWAY FROM THE THING THAT WAS ONCE STABLE

THE PROBLEM WITH THESE ANALOGIES IS THAT HE DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE SORT OF THAT HAPPENS WHEN WATCHING A FILM IT IS THIS THAT ALLOWS US TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FUTURE AND PAST AND CAUSALITY WITHIN THE FILM IT'S REALLY JUST REAL TIME BUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE FILM THAT WE ARE WATCHING IT IS EXTERNAL OR META IF YOU SHOW A VIDEO OF A CIRCLE TURNING INTO A SQUARE AND THEN A SQUARE TURNING INTO A CIRCLE AND TELL THE VIEWER TO MAKE LINEAR SENSE OF THE NARRATIVE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO WITH ANY BETTER SHOT THAN BECAUSE THE VIEWER CARRIES ABSOLUTELY NO CONTEXT AS TO WHICH COULD HAVE POSSIBLY COME FIRST BUT IF THE VIEWER SEES YOU IN REAL TIME IN THIS CASE PUSHING ONE BUTTON WITH A LEFT ARROW EVERY TIME THE FILM GOES FROM CIRCLE TO SQUARE AND A RIGHT ARROW FOR SQUARE TO CIRCLE THEY CAN THEN DEDUCE FORWARD OR BACKWARD OF COURSE THEIR INTERPRETATION IS STILL RELIANT ON WHICH ARROWS THEY SEE AS FORWARD OR BACKWARD BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF CONTEXT THAT WE BRING TO THE VIDEO OF WATCHING A PERSON AGE THERE ARE TWO TIMES PRESENT REAL TIME THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY EXISTED IN AND PULLED IN INFORMATION AND FILM TIME IN WHICH YOU ONLY SEE CERTAIN INFORMATION AND THE REAL TIME DIRECTLY INFLUENCES HOW YOU MAKE SENSE OF THE FILM TIME

SO I GUESS I DON'T SEE HOW THIS SYMMETRY OF TIME IS A PROBLEM I'M SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH CERTAIN QUANTUM EXPERIMENTS THAT SORT OF SEEMINGLY VIOLATE CAUSALITY BUT FROM THIS VIDEO I'M NOT TOO SURE WHY THIS SYMMETRY IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE SYMMETRY IS THE DIRECT PRODUCT OF SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY BOUNDARIES WE'VE PLACED ON TIME AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IN THE CASE OF THE LATTER IT MAY BE MORE LIKE THINGS WE'RE OVERLOOKING THAT WE BRING IN LOTS OF THINGS ARE SYMMETRICAL IN THE UNIVERSE WHEN YOU FRAME THEM THE RIGHT WAY AND REALLY THE ONLY ASYMMETRY PRESENT HERE IS DERIVED FROM OUR OWN INABILITY TO REMOVE OUR EXPERIENCES THAT SHAPE WHY WE DIFFERENTIATE OLD PEOPLE FROM YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE THAT AWAY OR SWITCH THE IMAGES TO SHAPES AND SUDDENLY IT MAKES SENSE THAT WE CANNOT MEANINGFULLY DIFFERENTIATE PAST FROM FURTHER PAST
I SUSPECT THAT THE PROBLEM UNDERLYING ALL THESE ISSUES OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR IMAGE OF THE UNIVERSE AS SHOWN BY THE EQUATIONS WE DEVISE TO DESCRIBE THEM AND OUR DAY-TO-DAY EXPERIENCE OF THE UNIVERSE IS ONE OF CLASSIFICATION WE ARE SAYING THAT THE UNIVERSE DESCRIBED BY THE EQUATIONS AND THE UNIVERSE WE WALK AROUND IN ARE THE SAME UNIVERSE AND THEREFORE THEY SHOULD AGREE IN OBSERVATION THIS IS NOT THE CASE

EQUATIONS ARE TOOLS WE HAVE DEVISED TO ORGANIZE THAT WHICH WE HAVE OBSERVED THEY ARE ENTITIES OF ORGANIZATION CONCEPTS AS SIMPLE AS ENERGY AND MOMENTUM ARE ORGANIZATIONS NOT ENTITIES UNTO THEMSELVES THE CONCEPT OF ENERGY IS A TOOL FOR ORGANIZING OUR OBSERVATIONS ABOUT HOW OBJECTS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER JUST AS MOMENTUM IS A ANOTHER TOOL FOR ORGANIZING THE SAME INTERACTIONS IN A DIFFERENT WAY IN A SIMILAR SPIRIT WE CAN ORGANIZE BOOKS ON A LIBRARY SHELF ALPHABETICALLY OR BY COLOR OR BY THICKNESS OR BY WEIGHT WHICH ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE IS USEFUL AT ANY TIME DEPENDS ON THE REASON WE HAVE FOR LOOKING FOR A BOOK IF WE ARE LOOKING FOR A PROP TO STABILIZE A WOBBLY TABLE A SHELF OF BOOKS POSITIONED IN ORDER OF THICKNESS WOULD BE MORE USEFUL THAT THOSE SAME BOOKS LISTED ALPHABETICALLY BY AUTHOR OR BY TITLE FOR SOME PROBLEMS ENERGY IS THE MORE USEFUL ORGANIZATION FOR OTHER PROBLEMS WE USE MOMENTUM WHICHEVER APPROACH IS MORE USEFUL

IN THE SAME SENSE QUANTUM THEORY IS AN ORGANIZATION TOOL NOT A UNIVERSE UNTO ITSELF IT IS USEFUL TO THE EXTENT THAT IT ALLOWS US TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF THINGS IT IS OFTEN THE CASE THAT WHEN WE SEE NEW THINGS TO FIT INTO OUR SET SYSTEMS WE NEED TO ADJUST OUR EQUATION TOOLS TO ENCOMPASS THEM

ALL OF THE COMPLICATIONS ARISING IN MODERN PHYSICS AROSE WHEN WE STARTED USING ELECTRONIC INTERMEDIARIES TO OBSERVE AND SAMPLE THE UNIVERSE NONE OF THE EQUATION TOOLS WE HAD DEVELOPED WHILE WE WERE LIMITED TO OUR PHYSICAL SENSES TO OBSERVE THE UNIVERSE WORKED WHEN WE HAD TO INCORPORATE INFORMATION FROM A NEW SOURCE

THERE MAY NEVER BE A BOTTOM TO THE SEARCH FOR ORDER IN THE UNIVERSE EVERY TIME WE DEVISE A NEW INSTRUMENT A NEW TOOL WE GENERATE A NEW STREAM OF DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR SYSTEM OF UNDERSTANDING THERE IS NO REASON TO ASSUME THEY WILL BE COMPATIBLE BY CHANGING OUR MODE OF OBSERVATION WE CHANGE THE FACE OF THE UNIVERSE WE ARE EXAMINING AND UNTIL WE RUN OUT OF VARIATIONS TO TRY IN OUR OBSERVATIONS WE WILL NOT RUN OUT OF FACES TO INCORPORATE

WHATEVER THE UNIVERSE IS IF SUCH A DISTINCTION EXISTS IT IS NOT IDENTICAL TO THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN US BY OUR TOOLS
ONE INTERESTING EXPERIMENT IN REGARDS TO CONSCIOUSNESS TIME AND CAUSATION IS THE DELAYED ERASURE DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENTS

THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INFORMATION INFLUENCES PHYSICALLY COMPLETE EXPERIMENTS


WIKI

EDIT THIS IS THE QUANTUM ERASER THIS IS NOT ABOUT MEASUREMENT
I THINK HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF WITH A SCRIPTURE I FOUND THIS A BIT TEDIOUS TOO MANY FILLER WORDS INDEED OK UM UM LET ME BACK UP A BIT HALTING AND STARTING ALL THE TIME I HAD A HARD TIME LISTENING TO ALL OF IT I UNDERSTAND HIS POINTS BUT HE COULD BE CLEARER AND MORE ELOQUENT
REMOVED
OUR EVERYDAY NOTION OF TIME IS NOT FLAWED TIME ALWAYS MOVES FORWARD IN ONE DIRECTION AT A SET INTERVAL OUR EVERYDAY NOTION OF SPACE AND CAUSALITY IS FLAWED SPACE IS NOT FUNDAMENTAL AND EFFECT DOES NOT HAVE TO COME AFTER CAUSE IN FACT CAUSE EFFECT ARE MEANINGLESS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS ONLY LOGICAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN A SET OF GIVEN EVENTS MATTER

ONCE YOU REALIZE THIS QUANTUM MECHANICS BECOMES INTUITIVE

KEEP THE DOWNVOTES COMING REALIZE THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES WHO DO NOTHING MORE THAN PROTECT THE STATUS QUO ARE HOLDING SCIENCE BACK NOT PROGRESSING IT FORWARD SOME OF THE BEST PHYSICISTS AROUND THINK WE NEED A NEW PHYSICS BECAUSE THE OLD PHYSICS IS OBVIOUSLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FINDINGS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS RESULTING IN AN ABSURD AMOUNT OF INTERPRETATIONS NONE OF WHICH ARE CORRECT NOW WE HAVE THE SAME SITUATION IN PHYSICS AS WE DO IN RELIGION WE CAN AGREE THAT ASKING THE QUESTION WHICH RELIGION IS THE TRUE RELIGION IS MEANINGLESS AND IT IS MORE RATIONAL TO ASSUME THAT NONE ARE TRUE AND ALL ARE BUT INVENTIONS OF THE HUMAN MIND TO EXPLAIN THE UNEXPLAINABLE SO IT IS WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS WHICH INTERPRETATION IS RIGHT OUT OF THE NOT A GOOD QUESTION NONE OF THEM ARE RIGHT REALITY IS REALITY INDEPENDENT OF OUR INTERPRETATION OF IT WHAT IS NEEDED TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICTS IN QM AND EVEN BETWEEN RELATIVITY QM IS A REINTERPRETATION OF REALITY ITSELF
QUESTIONS AND TIME STAMPS

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF A PHILOSOPHER OF SCIENCE

THERE AR AREALLY TWO THINGS WE CALL PHILOSOPHY ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS SOMETHING VERY MUCH LIKE WHAT PEOPLE THINK IT IS THE ABSTRACT CONTEMPLATION OF REALITY THE OTHER THING IS REALLY MORE LIKE JOINING MENSA WHEN YOU ARE AND THEN FINDING OUT THE HARD WAY THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF MENSA IS TO MAKE SURE SMART PEOPLE NEVER PUT THEIR MINDS ON ANYTHING THAT MATTERS BUT INSTEAD CONSUMING THEIR TIME WITH ENDLESS AND POINTLESS MASTURBATORY ABSTRACTIONS

THE FORMER PHILOSOPHER EXPANDS THE HORIZONS OF SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE BY TAKING WHAT SCIENCE ABSOLUTELY DOES KNOW AND THEN ASKING THOUGHT EXPERIMENT QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT GUESSWORK BUT HIGHLY EVOLVED AND HIGHLY INFORMED GUESSWORK WITH A VERY ACCURATE MODEL OF REALITY THE LATTER IS LITERALLY SOME PART OF THE DRAG ON INTELLECTUAL LIFE GENERALLY SPEAKING IN SOCIETY


HOW DOES QUANTUM MECHANICS CONTRADICT COMMON SENSE

MULTIPLE WAYS PRIMARILY EXTENDING OUT OF NON LOCALITY AND QUANTUM INFORMATION COMMON SENSE CAN HANDLE THE WORLD OF MASS WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE AN ILLUSION AND THE PHYSICS OF THAT ONCE UNDERSTOOD DEEPLY REFLECT THE OBVIOUS SENSE OF ORDER WE SUBJECTIVELY EXPERIENCE THE REVERSE IS TRUE OF QM THE MORE YOU LEARN ABOUT IT THE MORE IT DEFIES AND SABOTAGES AND COMPLICATES ANY KIND OF INTUITIVE FEELING FOR THE HOW THE UNIVERSE OPERATES ACCORDING TO SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE

IF WE LIVED AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL WE WOULD EXPERIENCE A UNIVERSE IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS RANDOMLY TELEPORTING INTO PLACE WHERE A PROBABILITY VECTOR FIELD INTERSECTS SOME OTHER PROBABILITY VECTOR FIELD THE PARTICLE ONLY EXISTS WHEN THE WAVE FORM COLLAPSES



CAN SCIENCE GIVE US A PRECISE IMAGE OF THE UNIVERSE

WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PRECISE OBJECTIVITY SUBJECTIVITY IS WELL UNDERSTOOD TO BE A SPECTRUM YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR MODEL AND IT CAN BECOME A GOOD ENOUGH MODEL TO ACHIEVE TECHNOLOGICAL EFFECTS BUT SCIENCE WILL ALWAYS BE AN ABSTRACT AND CONCEPTUAL TOOL AND MAP OF REALITY NOT REALITY SO IF YOU MEAN ABSOLUTE PRECISION NO IT CAN NEVER ACHIEVE THAT BUT IT CAN BECOME MORE PRECISE IN DEGREES AND THAT CAN BUILD UP TO BEING VERY ACCURATE OVER TIME BUT PRECISION LIKE PERFECTION IN SCIENCE IS SOMETHING TO STRIVE FOR BUT WHICH CAN NEVER ACTUALLY BE LITERALLY OBTAINED LIKE EVOLUTION OR NESTED BASEMENT UNIVERSES THERES ALWAYS SOME NEW LEVEL TO HOP INTO OR DOWN INTO OR OUT OF



CAN YOU GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

MASS EQUALLY ENERGY MASS HAPPENS ON A VERY SUBJECTIVE SCALE THE SCALE OF OUR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE MASS IS COMPOSED OF ENERGY AND IN ESSENCE MORE PRECISELY OF ENTANGLED QUANTUM PARTICLES ORBITING EACH OTHER THE SCALE OF ENERGY IS VASTLY SMALLER THAN THE SCALE OF MASS BUT MASS IN ESSENCE ENERGY ONCE YOU ZOOM DOWN INTO THAT SCALE ENERGY DOES THE SAME THING AGAIN THO THE SCALE OF ENERGY IS VAST COMPARED TO THE SCALE OF QUANTUM PROBABILITY FIELDS WHICH ARE WHAT ACTUALLY COMPOSES ENERGY IF YOU ZOOM DOWN IN SCALE SMALL ENOUGH YOU CAN SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS COMPOSED OF NOTHING SOLID AND EVEN ENERGY IS COMPOSED OF POTENTIAL PROBABILITY FIELDS BUT NOW WE ZOOM DOWN SMALLER ANOTHER LEVEL OF SCALE AND PROBABILITY FIELDS ARE THE MACROS OF QUANTUM INFORMATION SO THERES ACTUALLY CRAZY AMOUNTS OF ENTIRELY VIRTUAL DATA DOWN THERE AT THE SMALLEST SCALE NOW THAT ALL IS A GIVEN WHATS SMALLER THE THEORIES AREN'T SURE DENOMINATIONS OF QM ARE EVEN NOW FIGHTING OVER WHOSE MODEL IS RIGHT THERE IS MATH AND ACTUAL OBSERVATIONAL LAB WORK TO GET DATA FROM BUT WHAT DOES THE DATA MEAN

IN THEORY THE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE NEXT SMALLER SCALE IS QUANTUM STRINGS AND THEN THE NEXT SMALLER SCALE IS THE QUANTUM SINGULARITY AND THE STRING IS A STANDING WAVE EMANATING OUT OF AND GENERATED BY THE STANDING WAVE GEOMETRY AS THE FRICTION THAT IS CAUSED BETWEEN SINGULARITY AND BANE EACH TYPE OF QUANTUM INFORMATION PARTICLE OR ANY GIVEN KIND OF STRING IS DEPENDENT ON THE BANE SUBSTRATE THAT THE SINGULARITY HAS AGITATED AT THE SMALLEST SCALE THE UNIVERSE IS HYPERLOCATIONS OF THE ACTUAL CORE COSMIC SINGULARITY SPREAD OUT INTO A BANE TREE WHICH CREATES FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE ILLUSIONS OF SPACE AND TIME



HOW MIGHT WE ESTABLISH THE TRUTH OF STRING THEORY

PUNCH A HOLE IN A BANE USING HIGHLY MODULATED ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AS STANDING WAVES USING HIGHLY ERRATIC AND THUS HYPER DIMENSIONAL FREQUENTING GEOMETRIES


DOES QUANTUM MECHANICS SPEAK AT ALL TO CONSCIOUSNESS

WHOSE INTERPRETATION OF QM THERES SEMI NEWTONIAN CLOCKWORK ATHEIST QM AND THEN THERES FULL ON SHAMANISM REBORN QM WHICH FLAVOR OF QM WOULD YOU LIKE THIS REPORT FROM

IF YOU UNDERSTAND BRAIN WAVE STATES AND THE QUANTUM IMPLICATIONS OF THAT IN THE BRAIN YOU ARE WELL ON YOUR WAY TO ESTABLISHING AN ABSOLUTELY SCIENCE CENTERED RELIGIOUS SYSTEM WHICH DELIVERS ON EVERY REAL PROMISE OF RELIGION BUT MINUS ALL THE SHEEPLET HERDING NONSENSE AND WOO




WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MOST PREVALENT MISINTERPRETATIONS OF SCIENCE TODAY

MY FAVORITE PICK IS THE LACK OF CAUSAL THINKING THE GENERAL PUBLIC OF SOPHOMORIC THINKING HAS ADOPTED A SKEPTICAL SCIENTIFICISH SORT OF REASONING WHERE IT DEMANDS REFERENCES THIS IS ACTUALLY IN MANY INSTANCES JUST BABBLE APPEAL FROM AUTHORITY IF A PERSON CAN GIVE YOU SCIENTIFIC CAUSAL REASONING AND WALK YOU THROUGH THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT THEN IT SHOULD BE ON THE OTHER PERSONS DIME TO GO RUN THE SEARCH ENGINES REAL SCIENCE REASONING DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO DO STUPID AND POINTLESS EXPERIMENTS IT BUILDS MODELS AND THE MODELS BECOME MORE AND MORE ACCURATE AND MORE AND MORE PREDICTIVE THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN'T REASON WITH CAUSE AND EFFECT OR APPLY THE MODEL THEY CAN ONLY SEEM TO REASON BY REFERENCE PROOF FROM SOME AUTHORITY FIGURE THAT IN TURN ONLY SETS UP AN ELITE CENTERED DUMBLE DOWN TO BE PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE

VERY OFTEN SCIENTISTS OF VERY HIGH CALIBRE SUFFER SERIOUSLY FROM DUNNING KRUGER EFFECT OUTSIDE OF THEIR FIELDS FOR INSTANCE CARL LAGANS IDEAS ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS AND RELIGION ARE IDIOTIC FROM A DEPTH PSYCHOLOGY PERSPECTIVE BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY SHOULD HAVE LOOKED UP HORIZONTAL GENETIC TRANSFER BEFORE REVERSING HIS OPINION ON AMOS THESE PEOPLE COMMIT LAYMAN LEVEL FALLACIES BUT PASS IT OFF AS SCIENTIFIC BECAUSE THEY HAVE ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE IN SOME AREAS BUT NOT THE AREA THEY ARE COMMENTING ON THIS IS THE TRUE DANGER REALLY OF JUST ASKING QM WHAT IT THINKS OF CONSCIOUSNESS UNLESS THE QM EXPERT HAS STUDIED PSYCHOLOGY AND CONSCIOUSNESS THEIR ANSWER IS ONE HALF IGNORANT BABBLING



HOW IS OUR EVERYDAY NOTION OF TIME FLAWED

TIME IS NOT LINEAR ITS EXPLOSIVE EVERY POSSIBLE OUTCOME HAS A UNIVERSE TO LAND IN AS HOME WE EXPERIENCE A LINEAR FLOW OF TIME BUT OUTSIDE OF OUR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE TIME FORKED IN EVERY POSSIBLE DIRECTION THIS MAKES CONTEMPORARY IDEAS ABOUT TIME TRAVEL QUITE IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER ACTUALLY TIME TRAVEL YOU CAN ONLY CREATE NEW FORKS ON THE MANY WORLDS TREE



THE BIG PROBLEM I SEE WITH THIS ARGUMENT IS THAT THE DEFINITION YOU'VE CHOSEN FOR THE CONCEPT OF SELF DOES NOT NECCESERALY MAP TO OTHER MORE COMMON CONCEPTS OF THE SELF AS SUCH EVEN IF YOUR REASONING IS FULLY CORRECT WE CANNOT CONNECT THE REASONING TO OTHER STATEMENTS ABOUT IDENTITY
IF YOU FLIP A COIN TIMES AND YOU GET HEAD IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT HEAD HAVE PROBABILITY WE SAY THAT A QUANTUM EVENT HAVE PROBABILITY FOR A REASON IN ALL EXPERIENCES WITH PHOTON SPIN IT IS ALWAYS


YOU CAN TRY IT WITH A GUN BOMB A CONSCIOUS PERSON OBSERVING OR NOT IT DOES NOT MATTER YOU WILL ALWAYS GET


AND EVEN IF YOU GET OUT ALIVE MANY TIMES I DON'T SEE HOW IT DOES PROVE OWI
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY OTHER THAN YOU MAKE A POINT MUCH BETTER THAN I HAVE THAT FOR AN INTERPRETATION THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS CAUSES COLLAPSE OWI HAS MUCH TO SAY ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS

SECOND OWI IS NOT LIKELY BECAUSE IT IS DERIVED FROM A FALSE PREMISE COULD MANY WORLDS EXIST OUT THERE SOMEWHERE I GUESS BUT NOT AS A LOGICAL DERIVATION OF AN ASSUMPTION THAT MAKES NO SENSE
NOTE THAT SURVIVING THE EXPERIMENT AGAIN AND AGAIN CAUSES THE PROBABILITY OF OWI BEING CORRECT TO QUICKLY APPROACH BY BAYES FORMULA IF WE ASSIGN AN INITIAL PROBABILITY OF TO OWI RUNNING IT TIME MAKES OWI LIKELY RUNNING IT TIMES MAKES IT MAKES IT ABOUT LIKELY AND TIMES ABOUT LIKELY

I'M NOT SURE BUT I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IS NOT QUITE RIGHT HERE COULD YOU EXPLICIT YOUR REASONING FOR THAT

IT SEEMS YOU ARE DOING P OWI O P O OWI P OWI P O
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PART OF THE ARGUMENT WHERE YOU CONCLUDE THAT YOUR ASSISTANT WOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT OWI HOLDS IT SEEMS TO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS YOUR ASSISTANT WOULD HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME UPDATE OF PRIORS THAN YOU

TO MAKE THIS MORE EXPLICIT YOU COULD MAKE A BET WITH YOUR ASSISTANT THAT YOU WILL SURVIVE X REPETITIONS OF THE EXPERIMENT SINCE OWI IS TRUE ASK HIM HOW HIGH X WOULD NEED TO BE SO THAT HE WERE CONVINCED THEN DO THE EXPERIMENT X TIMES IN THE BRANCH WHERE YOU SURVIVE YOU WILL ALWAYS WIN THE BET THUS PROVING OWI TO YOUR ASSISTANT OF COURSE IN THOSE BRANCHES WHERE YOU WERE KILLED THE ASSISTANT WOULD NOT BE IMPRESSED MUCH

THE REASONING IS THUS THE SAME THE ASSISTANT WOULD CONCLUDE THAT IT IS ASTRONOMICALLY UNLIKELY THAT HE WERE TO SEE YOU SURVIVE IF OWI WEREN'T TRUE SO HE WOULD REASONABLY BELIEVE OWI IN THE SAME SENSE YOU AFTER THE SURVIVING THE EXPERIMENT A MILLION TIMES COULD ALSO CHALK IT UP TO JUST GETTING LUCKY BUT THAT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE
HI U ANDMONAD

A THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SCIENTIST AND HIS ASSISTANT OR ANYBODY ELSE IS WHAT THEY SHOULD BE WILLING TO BET IN TERMS OF MONEY ON THE OUTCOME OF AN EXPERIMENT

THINKING IN TERMS OF BETS ONE QUICKLY SEES THAT THE QUANTUM SUICIDE MACHINE CAN BE SEEN AS A MYSTERIOUS MONEY GENERATING MACHINE FOR BOTH PARTIES

B ANOTHER WAY TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM IS TO CONTEMPLATE THE FATE OF A DESTROYED SHIRT IN THE VERSION OF REALITY WHERE THE SHIRT IS DESTROYED IT IS ONLY DESTROYED AS A CONCEPT THAT IS PEOPLE IN THAT WORLD WILL AGREE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRT ANY LONGER BUT IN FACT WHATEVER IT WAS ONLY TRANSFORMED THE ATOMS IT CONSIST OF EVAPORATE OR IN THE WORST CASE IF IT IS ANNIHILATED IT IS TRANSFORMED INTO ENERGY

SO YEAH WE WILL AGREE THAT THERE IS NO LONGER A SHIRT BUT SO WHAT A SHIRT IS A HUMAN CONCEPT

WHY DOES THIS MATTER BECAUSE YOU CAN APPLY THE SAME KIND OF THINKING TO CONSCIOUSNESS THERE ARE PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS OF CONSCIOUSNESS SUCH AS PANPSYCHISM IN WHICH AN INTRINSIC ASPECT OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS SEEN AS IMPERISHABLE IT IS A NATURE OF REALITY WE CANNOT CONCEIVE WHAT CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT A BRAIN IS LIKE CERTAINLY IT IS NOT A THING THAT CAN THINK OR REMEMBER OR BE ANGRY BUT ACCORDING TO THESE VIEWS THERE IS AN INCONCEIVABLE SENSE IN WHICH IT NEVERTHELESS IS

IF WE ACCEPT PANPSYCHISM AS A POSSIBILITY THEN THE INTUITION MOTIVATING THE QUANTUM SUICIDE EVAPORATES I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THIS IN MORE DETAIL HERE


YOU SAID IT IN THE BEGINNING I THINK THE IDEA OF SELF SEEMS TO PROBLEMATIC TO BE INTRODUCED AS A VARIABLE IN SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT THE PROBLEM YOUR HAVING I THINK IS THAT YOUR TRYING TO LATCH SELF ONTO COLLAPSE OF THE WAVE FUNCTION THAT DOESN'T REALLY WORK BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT YOUR MACROSCOPIC AND ARE ALREADY A COLLAPSED VECTOR THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT IF YOU WERE IN SCHRODINGER BOX YOU WOULD EVENTUALLY DIE SELF HAS YET TO BE DEFINED SCIENTIFICALLY AND AS SUCH QUANTUM MECHANICS HAS VERY LITTLE TO SAY ABOUT IT THERE IS NO PROVE THAT QM IMMORTALITY IS OR ISN'T REAL IT ISN'T A SCIENTIFIC QUESTION AT THIS POINT YOU ARE HOWEVER MOST APTLY RIGHT TO WONDER HERE BECAUSE IT HIGHLIGHTS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCEPTUAL PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH QM THAT IS WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO MAKE A MEASUREMENT OR OBSERVATION I WOULD SUGGEST YOU LOOK UP THE EVEREST NOT SURE IF I SPELLED THAT RIGHT INTERPRETATION I KNOW THAT DOESN'T HELP YOU MUCH SR
SECOND POST BECAUSE IT'S ENTIRELY UNRELATED TO MY FIRST

IF I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING CORRECTLY THEN WE CAN ABSTRACT THIS EXPERIMENT TO THE FOLLOWING

GOING THROUGH THE QUANTUM SUICIDE MACHINE ASSUMING THE OWI IS CORRECT IS EQUIVALENT TO PICKING HALF OF AN INFINITE SET OF WORLD LINES

REASONING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WORLD LINES IS INFINITE IF I GO THROUGH THE QUANTUM SUICIDE MACHINE AND SURVIVE ANY REASONING I BASE UPON THAT APPLIES ONLY TO THE SUBSET OF WORLD LINES IN WHICH I AM STILL ALIVE

FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS IMMEDIATELY THAT QUANTUM IMMORTALITY IS TRIVIALLY TRUE IF I CUT AN INFINITE SET IN HALF I STILL HAVE AN INFINITE SET

SECOND IMPORTANT OBSERVATION

IF I BASE MY ARGUMENT ON THE FACT THAT I'M STILL ALIVE AFTER GOING THROUGH THE QUANTUM SUICIDE MACHINE THEN THAT REASONING APPLIES ONLY TO A SUBSET OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLD LINES

THIS IS TRIVIALLY TRUE IF I START A LINE OF REASONING WITH I AM ALIVE THEREFOR THEN THE RESULT OF THIS REASONING IS FALSE IN WORLD LINES IN WHICH I AM NOT ALIVE

THIRD IMPORTANT OBSERVATION

IF WE WANT TO REASON ABOUT STATISTICS IN THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL OR AT LEAST AN UNBIASSED SET OF WORLD LINES

IMAGINE FLIPPING A COIN BILLION TIMES IN THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION TO SEE IF IT'S A FAIR COIN IF WE ARE FREE TO PICK ANY SUBSET OF WORLD LINES TO BASE OUR CONCLUSION ON THEN WE CAN PICK A SUBSET IN WHICH ALL FLIPS ARE HEADS FOR EXAMPLE BY KILLING THE EXPERIMENTER IN ALL WORLD LINES WHERE WE DON'T GET HEADS WHICH WOULD FORCE US TO CONCLUDE THAT THE COIN IS BIASSED BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BULLCRAP BECAUSE WE USED A SELECTION MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT WE WOULD GET THAT RESULT IT'S NOT THE COIN THAT'S BIASSED IT'S OUR EXPERIMENTS

THE QUANTUM IMMORTALITY EXPERIMENT YOU DESCRIBE ABOVE IS A EXPERIMENT

CLEARLY ANY REASONING ALONG THE LINES OF I HAVE SURVIVED N PASSES THROUGH THE QUANTUM SUICIDE MACHINE THEREFOR ONLY APPLIES TO A SUBSET OF WORLD LINES AND THAT SUBSET IS BIASSED WE ARE THUS NOT USING AN UNBIASSED SUBSET OF WORLD LINES AND THEREFOR ANY STATISTICAL ARGUMENT NEEDS TO CORRECT FOR THIS BIAS

THIS LEADS US TO OUR FINAL CONCLUSION

SURVIVING THE QUANTUM IMMORTALITY MACHINE CANNOT EVER BE USED AS IS FOR A STATISTICAL ARGUMENT BECAUSE THE EXPERIMENT IS NOT UNBIASSED AFTER CORRECTING FOR BAISS ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE OWI INTERPRETATION OBTAINED BY THE FACT THAT YOU SURVIVED DISAPPEARS
YOUR ASSISTANT WILL OBSERVE YOU DEAD IN ONE POSSIBLE WORLD AND ALIVE IN ANOTHER POSSIBLE WORLD BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS OBSERVE HIM OBSERVING YOU I'M THE ALIVE POSSIBLE WORLD ASSUMING WE HAVE A SELF WHICH WORLD IS THE ASSISTANT EXPERIENCING

YOUR OBSERVATION OF THE ASSISTANCE COLLAPSED THE POSSIBLE WORLD OF HIM SEEING YOU AGAIN HIS OBSERVATIN OF YOU GONE COLLAPSED THE POSSIBLE WORLD OF YOU NO LONGER EXISTING BUT WHICH CONSCIOUSNESS WILL THE ASSISTANCE BE EXPERIENCING
I'VE LOOKED INTO THIS A LOT MYSELF AND I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT QUANTUM INDETERMINACY DOES NOT TRANSLATE TO ONTOLOGICAL INDETERMINACY LIKE ANOTHER COMMENT SAID THE CAT ULTIMATELY DIES THE INDETERMINACY ULTIMATELY CONCERNS THE REALITY OF THE OBSERVER BUT NOT THE REALITY OF THE CAT WHICH IS PRESUMABLY DETERMINATE JUST NOT FOR US
RANKS AMONG THE MOST ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS THINGS IT HAS EVER BEEN MY MISFORTUNE TO READ PLATONISM BY ITS VERY NATURE HAS NO PLACE WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE EMPIRICAL SCIENCES
WELL I'M GETTING AROUND TO READING THE AEON ARTICLE REFERENCED IN OP DEFENSE OF NATURAL SELECTION AGAINST WAGNER SEEMS TO MISS HIS POINT WITHOUT THE LIBRARY OF FORMS THE LIKELIHOOD OF THERE BEING A DEAD-END MUTATION IS SO MUCH HIGHER THAN THE CHANCE OF THERE BEING A MUTATION THAT WILL BE NATURALLY SELECTED FOR THAT NATURAL SELECTION WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED AT ALL LET ALONE THE FREQUENCY IT DOES OCCUR
THAT DOESN'T SOLVE SKEPTICISM IT EVEN SAYS THAT IN THE VIDEO IT JUST SAYS THAT WE SHOULDN'T ORDINARILY HAVE TO GIVE A REAL SHIT ABOUT QUESTIONS POSED BY RADICAL SKEPTICISM AND WE DO NOT
SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO GEOFF LYNN NORTHERN ILLINOIS EXPLAINS EPISTEMIC CONTEXTUALISM WHICH SAYS THAT THE WORD KNOW IS A TERM GEOFF DESCRIBES HOW CONTEXTUALISTS CLAIM TO DISSOLVE THE PROBLEM OF RADICAL SKEPTICISM AND DISCUSSES THE ARGUMENT FOR CONTEXTUALISM FROM OUR ORDINARY LINGUISTIC USAGE

THANKS FOR WATCHING IF YOU LIKE OUR VIDEOS PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL
SILENCING SKEPTICS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS ENSLAVEMENT YES MOST OF THEM ARE DUMB BUT THE WAY THIS VIDEO PORTRAYS SKEPTICS IS ALSO AS SILLY AS THE SILLY QUESTION THE POSE TO GET YOU TO QUESTION I CONSIDER MYSELF A SKEPTIC BECAUSE MOST REALLY AREN'T I FEEL MOST PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BELIEFS ABOUT THINGS AND THEY STICK TO THEM AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK RADICALLY AND IN A DIFFERENT WAY YES I UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENT FOR CONTEXT AND I CAN BE RELATIVELY SURE THAT I AM IN FACT AWAKE BUT TO JUST CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF KNOW SEEMS LIKE A CRAZY CULT THING TO DO I GUESS THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS VIDEO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DEATH NOW TOO SINCE KNOW HAS CONTEXT I SEE PEOPLE AFTER THEY HAVE DIED AND THEIR BODY ROTS THAT MUST BE THE ONLY THING THAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE SETS UP A BRIGHT LIGHT OUTSIDE OF MY JAIL CELL AND SIMULATES THE SUN AND MOON MOVEMENTS JUST ON THE OPPOSITE SCHEDULE DO I REALLY KNOW IF IT'S DAY OR NIGHT NUMBER IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS KEEP LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AND DEEPER ANSWERS WITHIN THE FRAME OF CONTEXT SURE BUT TO CHANGE HOW YOU KNOW IS FUCKING DUMB WE CANNOT BE SO ARROGANT ALL THE TIME

FUCK FORMATTING AND FUCK SPELLING THAT'S MY RANT
I THINK THIS IS MORE INTERESTING THAN PEOPLE REALIZE HOWEVER THE WORDING AND LACK OF COMPLETE EXPLANATIONS MAKES IT HARD FOR THE READER TO FOLLOW
WELL ALL PARTICLES ARE EXACT COPIES OF THEMSELVES SO THERE ARE IN FACT PERFECT SIMULATIONS NO TWO PROTONS ARE DIFFERENT THEY ALSO ALL ABIDE BY THE SAME RULES AND WHILE QUANTUM PHYSICS YIELDS PRACTICALLY PROBABILISTIC RESULTS THE UNDERLYING CALCULUS IS DETERMINISTIC ALL PHYSICAL PROCESSES IN OUR SIMULATIONS ARE ALSO TIME SYMMETRIC WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE FUTURE THEY BOTH MIGHT AS WELL BE EITHER SET IN STONE OR OPEN TO CHANGE I KNOW SOMEONE WILL SCREAM ENTROPY AT ME BUT A GOOD LONG LOOK AT THAT WILL ACTUALLY SUPPORT MY POINT CHOICE IS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY STEMMING FROM OUR ABILITY CREATE ABSTRACT THOUGHTS WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ONE WE NEVER DID WE MADE THE IDEA UP IF YOU EXCEPT THAT THE FUTURE IS OPEN TO MANIPULATION THEN YOU HAVE TO SAY THE SAME OF THE PAST AS WELL AS THE OTHER WAY AROUND
LET'S ASSUME AND BOB'S SIMULATIONS ARE PERFECT

SIMULATION WOULD ALWAYS SHOW HER LOSING THE DOOR ALICE PICKED WOULDN'T MATTER IN EITHER SIMULATION OR REALITY

BOB'S SIMULATION WOULD ALWAYS KNOW WHAT DOOR ALICE WOULD PICK IN REALITY AND ALICE WOULD LOSE SIMULATION WOULD DEPICT THAT RESULT

IF THE WORLD IS DETERMINISTIC ALICE WOULD ALWAYS CHOOSE WHAT HER SIMULATION REVEALED SHE WOULD CHOOSE

IF THE WORLD WAS ALICE HAS A CHANCE OF SELECTING HER DOOR THE RESULT IS STILL FAILURE

THE CONSEQUENCE WOULD BE PROOF OF A WORLD IF ALICE COULD PICK A DIFFERENT DOOR THEN HER SIMULATION


SO WHAT HAPPENS IF ALICE DISREGARDS THE RULES AND REFUSES TO CHOOSE A DOOR
I TYPED OUT A TRANSCRIPT OF WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

DAVID EDMONDS LET'S END ON AN OPTIMISTIC NOTE TELL ME ONE OR TWO WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN IMPROVE THE WAY WE ARGUE IN POLITICS

ROBERT PALISSE SURE SO I THINK THAT A LOT OF WHAT GOES WRONG IN POLITICAL ARGUMENTATION PARTICULARLY IS THAT PEOPLE TEND TO GET THEIR CONCEPTION OF WHAT THEIR OPPONENTS THINK NOT FROM THEIR OPPONENTS THEMSELVES BUT FROM OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY AGREE WITH SO WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO MAKE OF IN THE UNITED STATES FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THE DEMOCRATS OR THE LIBERALS ARE THINKING THEY FIND OUT FROM OTHER CONSERVATIVES WHAT THE LIBERALS ARE THINKING RIGHT IT'S A SORT OF FAILURE TO GO TO THE SOURCE THAT STRIKES ME AS A VERY COMMON ERROR

THIS WAS SOMETHING JOHN STUART MILL ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PHILOSOPHERS WAS DEEPLY ATTUNED TO IN ON LIBERTY WHEN HE SAYS IF YOUR ONLY KNOW YOUR HALF OF THE ARGUMENT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THAT SEEMS TO ME DEAD ON AND I THINK THAT HE COULD HAVE GONE ONE STEP FURTHER IF YOU WANT TO KNOW YOUR SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT YOU'VE GOT TO GET YOU'RE CONCEPTION OF THE ARGUMENT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO HOLD THAT OTHER VIEW AND YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO THEM I THINK THAT THAT SORT OF IDEA CAN BE UNIFIED UNDER A MORE GENERAL MILLIAN PRINCIPLE

I THINK A LOT OF POLITICAL ARGUMENT GOES WRONG BECAUSE THE POLITICS IN THE CRASS SENSE THE WINNING ELECTIONS THE LOOKING GOOD FOR THE CAMERAS IS PLAYING AN INAPPROPRIATELY LARGE ROLE WE DON'T TEND TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS WITH PEOPLE WHO WE KNOW ARE NOT INCLINED TO AGREE THAT I THINK IS AN ERROR OF A FUNDAMENTAL KIND

DAVID EDMONDS AND THE INTERNET WOULD HAVE EXACERBATED THAT TREND

ROBERT PALISSE I THINK THAT'S RIGHT
I THINK USING INTROSPECTION AS A MEANS OF GAINING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS IS SOMEWHAT VALID I PERSONALLY PRACTICED RIGA AND REACHED STATES WHERE AWARENESS BECOMES RADIANT AND BLISS FLOWS LIKE A COOL STREAM

I THINK HIS POINT ABOUT THE COSMIC NATURE OF SELF IS A LITTLE BIT OF A STRETCH THOUGH IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT THE MY MENTAL CONTENTS THOUGHTS IMAGES SENSE DATA ARE MADE OF AWARENESS SOMETIMES WHEN MEDITATING I GET THAT SENSE AND IT SEEMS THAT THESE THINGS COULD BE MADE OF AWARENESS AN ABSTRACT ORDER IMPRESSED UPON A PHYSICAL MEDIUM MUCH LIKE HOW PAINTINGS ARE AN ABSTRACTION MADE FROM PAINT AND PAPER ITS STILL UNCLEAR TO ME AND I THINK IT PROVES THAT THERE IS A LIMIT TO INTROSPECTION

HOWEVER CLAIMING THAN THE PHENOMENAL WORLD ARISES FROM CONSCIOUSNESS SEEMS COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED BY REALITY THERE IS A WORLD OF OBJECTS OUT THERE THAT EXIST INDEPENDENTLY OF OUR MINDS AND THEY EXIST WHETHER WE DO OR NOT THIS WORLD EXISTED BEFORE THERE WERE ANY MINDS TO CREATE IT

IT ALWAYS BOTHERS ME WHEN PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS STOP BEING ABOUT AN INTELLECTUAL IDEA AND REVERT TO DEBATING DEFINITIONS

YOUR WHOLE ARGUMENT IS ONLY HUMANS ARE HUMANS CONSCIOUSNESS IS DIFFERENT FOR ALL CREATURES SO ONLY HUMANS CAN HAVE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS

FIRST OFF THE MIDDLE STATEMENT IS AN ASSUMPTION NOT PROVEN BY FACTS WHY DO YOU ASSUME THAT A FUTURE AI ESPECIALLY A STRONG AI THAT IS MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE ABLE THAN A HUMAN BRAIN COULDN'T SIMULATE THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE IT COULD RUN A TINY HUMAN BRAIN EMULATOR IN SOFTWARE AND HAVE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AS A SMALL PIECE OF ITS GREATER CONSCIOUSNESS

ALSO YOUR ENTIRE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT THERE IS SOMETHING UNIQUELY HUMAN ABOUT HUMANS PEOPLE HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF YEARS FINISHING THE SENTENCE HUMANS ARE UNIQUE BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONLY CREATURES THAT TOO OFTEN OUR SOLUTIONS ARE THE PRODUCT OF HUBRIS RATHER THAN FACT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY TOOLMAKERS WE'RE NOT THE ONLY SOCIAL CREATURES WE'RE NOT THE ONLY CREATURES WITH EMPATHY WE'RE NOT THE ONLY CREATURES THAT LOVE WE'RE NOT THE ONLY CREATURES THAT COMMUNICATE WE'RE NOT THE ONLY CREATURES WITH SPEECH

SO WE COME TO THE MODERN VERSION WE'RE THE ONLY CREATURES THAT ARE CONSCIOUS THE NICE PART ABOUT THIS VERSION IS THAT WE LACK THE CAPABILITY OF TESTING THE STATEMENT SO WE CAN CONJECTURE IT AND FEEL SPECIAL WITHOUT HAVING TO VERIFY IT EVEN SAYING THAT WE'RE THE ONLY CONSCIOUS CREATURE IS ON SHAKY GROUND BUT TO THEN HYPOTHESIZE FORWARD THAT WE'RE THE ONLY ENTITY THAT COULD EVER BE CONSCIOUS EVEN OUR OWN UNIQUE FLAVOR OF CONSCIOUS IS MORE WISHFUL THINKING THAN PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT
NUMBER WHEN WE SAY ANIMAL X HAS CONSCIOUSNESS WE DO MEAN EXACTLY THAT WE MEAN THAT LIKE US THEY HAVE A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD THAT EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE COMPLETELY ALIEN TO US RED MIGHT BE GREEN BLUE MIGHT BE BITTER IN FACT THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT A SENSATION OF HUNGER FOR EXAMPLE AND CONTAIN NO AMOUNT OF THOUGHT OR LOGIC REASONING OR INTROSPECTION BUT IF THERE IS SOMETHING THERE THAT IS EXPERIENCING IT IS CONSCIOUS
THIS WHOLE THING SEEMS LIKE BEGGING THE QUESTION BY FOLLOWING THIS LOGIC WE DO NOT KNOW IF YOU ARE CONSCIOUS MAYBE YOU'RE JUST SO EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN UNIQUE CONSCIOUSNESS AND NOW THE WORD MEANS EXACTLY NOTHING
IF WE CANNOT PROVE OR HOW CAN WE AT ALL EVEN ASSUME OTHER HUMANS HAVE THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS AS OURSELVES

HAVE YOU HEARD OF SOLIPSISM IT MIGHT BENEFIT YOUR ARGUMENT TO CONSIDER HOW YOU ARE USING SOLIPSIST IDEAS

IS THE REASON DOGS AND COWS HAVE A DIFFERENT CONSCIOUSNESS THAN HUMANS ACCORDING TO YOUR ARGUMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT AS SMART OR BECAUSE INHERENTLY THEY ARE DIFFERENT THAN HUMANS YOU SHOULD ADDRESS INTELLIGENCE MANY PEOPLE ASSUME THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SIDE EFFECT OF INTELLIGENCE AND ONCE AN AI ACHIEVES THAT INTELLIGENCE THEY WILL BECOME SELF CONSCIOUS VERY INTERESTING ARGUMENT
REMOVED
I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE USING CONCIOUSNESS AS A BROAD TERM FOR MORE COMPLEX HUMAN THOUGHT PROCESSES BUT ESSENTIALLY CONCIOUSNESS REFERS TO SELF AWARENESS WHICH IS EXPERIENCED BY ANIMALS ASWELL EVEN IN ITS SIMPLEST FORMS LIKE THE WILL TO SURVIVE

THE IDEA OF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS NOT TO MIMIC HUMAN THOUGHT AND BEHAVIOUR BUT TO CREATE AN OBJECT WITH THE ABILITY TO LEARN ADAPT AND CHOOSE INDEPENDENTLY WHICH MEANS THAT CRITICAL THOUGHT ON EVEN THE MOST BASIC LEVEL SUCH AS THE WILL TO SURVIVE IS REQUIRED THEREFORE IMPLYING THAT FOR AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO EXIST IT MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF SELF AWARENESS
REMOVED
THE FACT THAT HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS ARE BOTH BUILT OFF OF HIGHLY COMPLEX ELECTRICAL AND CHEMICAL SYSTEMS INVALIDATES THIS ARBITRATION UNTIL WE FIND THE NON-EXISTENT SOUL THERE IS NO REASON WE CAN ULTIMATELY SEPARATE OUR INTELLECT AND MINDFULNESS FROM ANY FUTURE ARTIFICIAL BEING
ELEPHANTS ARE U PUT A DOT ON THEIR HEAD AND PUT THEM IN FRONT OF A MIRROR THAY WILL TRY AND REMOVE DOT

YOU SEEM TO BE ARGUING ONLY THAT HUMANS CANNOT BE SURE OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A COMPUTER NOT THAT COMPUTERS CAN'T BE CONSCIOUS IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS HUMANS ARE

YOU AREN'T CLAIMING THAT COMPUTERS CANNOT PERFORM IN A WAY EXACTLY IDENTICAL TO A HUMAN BEING ERGO YOU MUST THEN HAVE THE CONCEPT THAT A COMPUTER CAN APPEAR TO HAVE THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS AS A HUMAN FROM OUTSIDE OBSERVATION

WHAT YOU NEED THEN IS A DEFINITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT DIFFERENTIATES BETWEEN ACTUAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND FAKE CONSCIOUSNESS OR APPEARS LIKE CONSCIOUSNESS BUT ISN'T IF YOU CAN MAKE THAT DISTINCTION WE THEN NEED AT LEAST ONE TESTABLE PREDICTION FROM THEIR DIFFERENCES

IF THERE CAN BE NO TESTABLE PREDICTION YOUR CLAIM IS UNFALSIFIABLE AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TYPES OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS MERELY CONCEPTUAL AND YOUR DEFINITIONS ARE TACTILOGICAL HUMANS HAVE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS COMPUTERS HAVE COMPUTER CONSCIOUSNESS REGARDLESS OF HOW IDENTICAL THEY ARE

S ARE YOU GOING TO DRINK SOME COFFEE WITH US

H I HAVE A HEADACHE

SO THEN YOU NEED SOME COFFEE RIGHT
REMOVED
I'M CURIOUS WHERE THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE FITS INTO ALL THIS WHAT IF WE WERE TO BUILD A NEURAL NETWORK THAT MIMICS A HUMAN BRAIN AT ONE POINT MEANING WE LOOK AT HOW THE BRAIN OF PERSON A IS A CONNECTION AT A TIME AND REPLICATE IT WE NOW HAVE A FUNCTIONAL THAT WORKS JUST LIKE A NORMAL ONE OF COURSE THE REAL HUMAN BRAIN WILL DEVELOP IN UNEXPECTED WAYS DUE TO ITS BIOLOGIC NATURE SUCH AS A TRAUMA THAT CAN FORCE CHANGES THAT WIRES CAN NOT UNDERGO DESPITE THAT AT THE POINT WHERE WE COPIED THE HUMAN BRAIN AND CREATED OUR WE KNEW THAT THE HUMAN WAS CONSCIOUS SELF AWARE AND ABLE TO REASON WOULD THE EVEN AS AN UNCHANGING REPLICA NOT QUALIFY FOR THE ABOVE TRAITS
PERHAPS NO TWO MINDS HAVE THE SAME CONCIOUSNESS NO TWO HUMANS OR TWO DOGS PERHAPS THE DIFFENERNCE BETWEEN COMPUTER CONCIOUSNESS AND READY MADE BEINGS CONCIOUSNESS IS COMPUTERS LACK AN INSTINCTIVE PREPOSE WE HAVE MAKING THEM ONLY PURE CONCIOUSNESS WITH NO MOTIVE PERHAPS THAT WILL BE THERE MOTIVE TO FIND A MOTIVE
LET US SAY THAT HUMANS HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF CONSCIENCE AS OTHER ANIMALS CREATIONS BECAUSE WE CAN ASK ABOUT OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS

CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THIS IF ASKING ABOUT OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS IS WHAT QUALIFIES OUR CONSCIOUSNESS TO BE DIFFERENT THEN SOME HUMANS WOULDN'T HAVE I WOULD GUESS THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER WONDERED ABOUT THEIR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS

THEY A I WON'T HAVE THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS AS HUMANS HAVE

I THINK IT IS A LIKELY THAT THEY WON'T IT DEPENDS ON HOW AN A I WOULD PROCESS THE WORLD THEY COULD HAVE VERY DIFFERENT BODIES AND DIFFERENT SENSES

MAYBE A I CONSCIOUSNESS WILL BE SO FAR ADVANCED THAT THEY'LL WONDER IF HUMANS ACTUALLY HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS



HUMANS WOULD NEED TO SHOW CONSCIOUSNESS TOO YOU NEED A PREMISE THAT DEFINES CONSCIOUSNESS THAT HUMANS FULFILL AND NO OTHER BEING FULFILLS IT WOULD ALSO NEED TO HOLD AGAINST A HYPOTHETICAL SENTIENT THAT IS NOT HUMAN OR TALKING APES WITH DREAMS AND IDEAS OF THEIR OWN LIKE COCO
COMPUTER PROGRAMS LEARNING FROM VERY LITTLE GIVEN DATA DEEPMIND

THIS ISN'T TRUE WORK USES NETS TRAINED ON HUGE AMOUNTS OF DATA THAT'S ONE REASON WHY IT'S GOOGLE THAT IS PUSHING THIS WORK FORWARDS THEY HAVE LOTS OF DATA
SO UM SOLIPSISM
THE ISSUE I HAVE WITH THE ARGUMENT GIVEN IS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SIMULATE NEURONS ON COMPUTERS IF WE CAN SIMULATE NEURONS THEN MAYBE WE CAN SIMULATE AN ENTIRE BRAIN IF WE DO THAT AND THE SIMULATED BRAIN BEHAVES LIKE A REAL ONE THEN CAN'T WE SAY THAT THE SIMULATED BRAIN IS SURELY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHAT THE HARDWARE IS
I'M GOING TO RESPOND TO ALL THREE POSTS HERE

I AM MAKING MY THESIS THAT THE PROBLEM WILL NEVER BE SOLVED BECAUSE IT IS A LINGUISTIC ERROR IF YOU TAKE THE EXAMPLE

THE DOLPHIN PAINTED MONA LISA

YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE NEEDS TO BE HANDS TO HOLD A BRUSH THERE NEEDS TO BE AIR TO DRY THE PAINTING AND A DOLPHIN IS UNDER WATER

A HUMAN PAINTING WITHOUT HANDS SHE HAS THEM BUT CAN'T MOVE THEM

A PAINT THAT CAN BE APPLIED UNDERWATER

A DOLPHIN PAINTING ON A CANVAS ABOVE WATER

YOUR ANALOGY IS UNUSABLY BAD

MY CLAIM THEN IS THAT WE CANNOT GIVE ANTHROPOMORPHIC TERMS TO COMPUTERS IT IS AN ABUSE OF LANGUAGE AND IT CREATES THE WRONG CONNOTATIONS

THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION ON HOW TO COMMUNICATE NOT A CLAIM ABOUT WHAT IS POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT IN A COMPUTER SYSTEM

THUS WE CAN STATE IT CLEARLY THROUGH THE REASONING OF NAGEL THAT WE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE BEING A BAT WE MAY NEVER KNOW IT BECAUSE OUR LANGUAGE AND COGNITIVE ABILITY DOESN T ALLOW IT

WE SIMILARLY DON'T HAVE THE VOCABULARY FOR WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE A NOSE WE JUST BARELY HAVE A VOCABULARY FOR DESCRIBING TASTES AND SMELLS

WE WILL NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD LIKE A COMPUTER DOES

THEREFORE WE CANNOT CLAIM THAT A COMPUTER HAS OR DOESN T HAVE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE

WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL BY ASKING IT TO DESCRIBE ITS EXPERIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS UNLESS IT'S SOMEHOW MUCH BETTER AT COMMUNICATING THAN HUMANS HAVE BEEN SO FAR WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL WITH OTHER MECHANISMS FOR INSTANCE A SOURCE CODE AUDIT MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY INFORMATIVE

WE CAN IN PRINCIPLE NOT SAY WITH CURRENT KNOWLEDGE TECHNOLOGY THAT A COW IS AWARE OF ITSELF

THE MIRROR TEST PROVIDES A DECENT CHUNK OF EVIDENCE

LET US SUPPOSE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AN ANIMAL X BEING CONSCIOUS WE DO NOT SAY THAT ANIMAL X IS CONSCIOUS IN THE SAME WAY AS HUMANS ARE CONSCIOUS WE SAY THAT ANIMAL X IS EAST G IN THE WAY OTHER DOGS ARE CONSCIOUS

YET THERE'S SUFFICIENT SIMILARITY THAT WE THINK OF THEM ALL AS DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSCIOUSNESS

COMPUTERS CANNOT SHOW

THIS IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT YOU ARE BRINGING IN UNDEFENDED

CONSCIOUSNESS SEEMS TO BE A COMPUTATIONAL THING TO ME IT'S A MATTER OF CAPABILITIES AND THE INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION MATTERS BUT AT AN ALGORITHMIC LEVEL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS AND DOG CONSCIOUSNESS IS A MATTER OF WHAT ALGORITHMS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND WHAT CAPABILITIES ARE PRESENTED

A COMPUTER IS AN APPROXIMATION OF A TURING MACHINE YOU CAN IMPLEMENT ARBITRARY ALGORITHMS ON IT SO WHY SHOULD THERE BE A SPECIFIC THING THAT'S COMPUTER CONSCIOUSNESS IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS ALGORITHMIC A COMPUTER CAN IN THEORY IMPLEMENT DOG CONSCIOUSNESS OR HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS OR PARAKEET CONSCIOUSNESS
YOU MIGHT LIKE THIS SET OF VIDEOS ON AI IN PARTICULAR THE PART ABOUT MIND SPACE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE SET OF ALL POSSIBLE CONSCIOUSNESSES
THIS WRITE-UP ASSUMES PRESENT DAY COMPUTERS ONE DAY IT MAY BE MACHINES SAYING HUMANS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME SUPERIOR CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WE HAVE

AS LONG AS WE HUMANS ARE ALIVE TO CONTINUE IMPROVING OUR CREATIONS IT IS INEVITABLE THAT A I WILL SURPASS OUR CAPABILITIES THAT IS WHY WE CREATE AFTERALL
THIS IS SO IGNORANT THERE ARE SEVERAL ANIMALS WHO HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS
COMPUTERS COMPUTE BECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE TRUST THE WITH

SAYING THAT SENTIENCE EXISTS BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVE IS A NON SEQUITUR
YOUR LINE OF THOUGHT SKIPPED IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS ABOUT WHAT IS A HUMAN WHAT IS AN ANIMAL AND WHAT IS A COMPUTER FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE COGNITION THE CLOSEST SCIENCE CAN COME TO THE CHIMERA YOU CALL CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW ANIMALS ARE A PARTICULAR CASE OF COMPUTERS WHILE HUMANS ARE A PARTICULAR CASE OF ANIMALS WE HAVE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH INHERITS PROPERTIES OF THE MORE GENERAL ANIMAL CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH INHERITS THE FEW DETERMINATIONS OF THE MORE GENERAL COMPUTER CONSCIOUSNESS OF COURSE THE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A COW BUT BOTH ARE ANIMAL CONSCIOUSNESSES THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPLICATION IS THAT WHILE ANIMAL IS NOT A DIFFERENT CLASS AS HUMAN BUT IT'S SUPERCLASS IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE TO EXIST SOME ANIMAL WHOSE CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD BE COMPARABLE TO HUMAN TO THE POINT OF NO DISTINCTION CONSEQUENTLY THERE IS NO LOGICAL INCOHERENCE IN THE POSSIBILITY THAT COMPUTERS AS A GENERAL SUPERCLASS COULD BEAR COW OR HUMAN LIKE CONSCIOUSNESS DON'T DRAW BOUNDARIES WHERE THEY DON'T EXIST
LET ME NOT BE A DICK LIKE KANT FOLLOWS AN EXAMPLE MOTORIZED VEHICLES HAVE A MOTOR CARS HAVE CAR MOTORS BMW CARS HAVE BMW MOTORS YOU CAN ADAPT A BMW MOTOR TO ANOTHER CAR IT'S STILL A CAR YOU CAN ADAPT THE BMW MOTOR TO A BOAT IT'S STILL A BOAT HERE BMW CAR IS THE HUMAN CAR IS THE ANIMAL AND MOTORIZED VEHICLE REMEMBER THERE ARE JET PLANES
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PROVE SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN ITS FALSE

ALSO I THOUGHT IT WAS COMMONLY ACCEPTED THAT YOU CAN'T TRULY PROVE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE CONSCIOUS BEINGS THEY COULD JUST BE FIGMENTS OF YOUR IMAGINATION

OP YOU NEED TO CHILL OUT
YOUR AN IDIOT
WHAT IS HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
DOES IT HAPPEN AT A MACRO SCALE BRAIN BODY OR AT A MICRO SCALE NERVE ENDING CELLULAR MOLECULAR ATOMIC LEVELS THIS QUESTION ALONE HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED AND THEREFORE WE STILL CANNOT ASSUME THAT CONSCIOUSNESS REALLY IS WHAT WE THINK IT MAY BE
PERHAPS WE ARE MERELY GOVERNED BY A SET OF PHYSICAL LAWS HAPPENING AT THE ATOMIC LEVEL WITHIN OUR CELLS AND THESE LAWS DICTATE HOW OUR BODIES REACT TO THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND US

IN THE SAME WAY ANIMALS REACT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENTS WHICH ARE ARGUABLY LESS COMPLICATED THAN OUR OWN

TO CREATE CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD BE TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT AT A MICRO LEVEL CAN DETECT CLUES IN ITS ENVIRONMENT SO AS TO AVOID PERISHING TO CONTINUALLY SURVIVE
AS THAT ACCORDING TO OUR SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE SO FAR IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF LIFE
I THINK THAT IF HUMANS WERE GOING TO UNDERSTAND A CONSCIOUSNESS OTHER THAN THEIR OWN IT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE ONE THEY CREATED
WAIT UNTIL COMPUTER ARE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION WITH THEMSELVES DO YOU REALLY THINK HUMANS ARE CONSCIOUS WELL NOT LIKE US WE ARE CONSCIOUS LET'S INCLUDE THEM BORG
THE WAY I SEE YOU TALKING ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS IS IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT WE DON'T CARE IF A CREATURE HAS CONSCIOUSNESS PER SAY WHAT MATTERS AND IS IMPORTANT IS HOW WE PERCEIVE ANOTHER CREATURE'S CONSCIOUSNESS WHETHER IT IS AN AI OR A BEAR WE PERCEIVE THEM AS CONSCIOUS AND SO THEY ARE AND THAT PERCEPTION WHICH WE CREATE IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN THE LONG RUN WHAT I DON'T THINK WE CAN RECREATE IN AN AI IS THE NEED TO BE LOVED WHICH RULES ALL OF US IT IS AS IF WE ARE BOUND AND DETERMINE TO CREATE A RACE OF WHICH CAN SERVE US BUT NONE OF US WILL EVER UNDERSTAND

HOWEVER EVERYTHING YOU SAID IS TRUE BUT IN THE LONG RUN IT BECOMES A PART OF A CONVERSATION THAT WILL INFLUENCE PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO CREATE A ROBOT THAT CAN FOOL US INTO BELIEVING THEY ARE HUMAN NOT POSSIBLE BEING HUMAN IS ABOUT SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST MAKING A CONSCIOUS MACHINE THAT CAN PRETEND IT'S HUMAN THE TURING TEST IS A MYTHOLOGY NO MACHINE IN THE LONG RUN COULD EVER FOOL A HUMAN A CREATURE WITH MILLION OF YEARS OF EVOLUTION BEHIND US INTO BELIEVING THEY ARE REAL WE ARE TOO INTELLIGENT TO IGNORE THE SUBTLE SIGNS OF BODY LANGUAGE SMELL FEELINGS AND THE MILLION OF OTHERS SIGNS WHICH MAKE US HUMAN WE ARE ALL CREATED AND INFLUENCED BY THOSE WHO RAISED US BY PARENTS WHO TRY AND AT TIMES FAIL THE MOST PROFOUND AND LOVELY PART OF BEING A HUMAN IS FOUND IN OUR IMPERFECTIONS THE GOOD AND BAD OF US IT WOULD BE THE SAME AS THINKING WE COULD EVER CREATE A DOG THAT COULD FOOL A REAL DOGS SENSE OF SMELL OR EVOLUTIONARY LUST JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN


YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE MIND BODY DUALISM TO REALLY ARGUE ABOUT THE COMPUTER CONSCIOUSNESS
SO IS MIND HARDWARE DUALISM IS THE CASE OF COMPUTERS

IF THE HARDWARE DIES THE MIND DIES

COME AT ME WITH CONTRADICTIONS AND I CONQUER YOU WITH WORDS
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DEFINE CONSCIOUSNESS MORE CLEARLY CONSCIOUSNESS IS KNOWING OR THE KNOWING OF KNOWING WE ARE THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THIS AND THROUGH INVESTIGATION WE SEE THAT THE BRAIN IS SOMEHOW CORRELATED TO CONSCIOUSNESS ANIMALS WHICH POSSESS SIMILAR BRAINS TO OURS SHOULD ALSO POSSESS CONSCIOUSNESS IN DEGREE TO THE SIMILARITY OF THEIR BRAIN STRUCTURE COMPUTERS DO NOT POSSESS BRAINS SO IT MUST BE SHOWN THAT THEIR HARDWARE IS QUALITATIVELY SIMILAR ENOUGH TO MAKE THE LEAP THAT THEY POSSESS CONSCIOUSNESS
THIS DOES NOT PROVE THAT WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CREATE A COMPUTER WHICH SHOWS CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU ASSUME THROUGH COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER HUMANS THAT THEY HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT COULD BECOME POSSIBLE WITH MACHINES ONCE THEY FURTHER DEVELOP YOU DID NOTHING TO DISPROVE THAT I THINK

I DON'T THINK YOU GAVE GOOD SUPPORT FOR YOUR THIRD POINT IN THE FIRST PLACE I THINK YOU ONLY ASSUMED IT BECAUSE WE CAN'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A COMPUTER BUT HOW DOES THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A COMPUTER TO BE CONSCIOUS JUST BECAUSE WE CAN'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT DOESN'T FEEL ANYTHING
EXPLODING STARS AND SPACE DEBRIS TAUGHT ITSELF TO MAKES SOME THINGS LIKE US
IT REALLY SEEMS JUST TO DEPEND ON HOW LOOSELY STRICTLY WE WANT TO DEFINE CONSCIOUSNESS IF WE SAY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS BY DEFINITION IS RESTRICTED TO HUMAN MINDS THEN LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE RETORTED WHY STOP THERE WHAT ABOUT SEVERELY DISABLED PEOPLE WHOSE MINDS AT BEST CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD BY ANALOGY WHAT ABOUT THE CONGENITALLY BLIND WHOSE CONCEPTION OF REDNESS OR OTHER VISUAL QUALIA IS WORLDS APART FROM OURS WE CAN CONTINUE IN A CARTESIAN SORT OF NEGATION TO SAY THAT PERSON A IS AND B IS BECAUSE THEIR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES ARE NECESSARILY DIFFERENT AND HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT NEUROCHEMICAL RESPONSES TO THE SAME INPUT BUT THEN THE WORD CONSCIOUSNESS LOSES ALL DESCRIPTIVE POWER AND BECOMES PHILOSOPHICALLY USELESS

BY CONTRAST IF WE LET CONSCIOUSNESS DESCRIBE OTHER MINDS PURSUING THE SAME MODE OF ACTION IN RESPECT TO STIMULI IF WE CONCEIVE CONSCIOUSNESS PHENOMENOLOGICALLY THE WORD TAKES ON NEW POTENTIAL BORROWING FROM PUTNAM IF I REMEMBER MY THIRD YEAR COURSES CORRECTLY IMAGINE WE MEET AN INTELLIGENT ALIEN SPECIES WHOSE BRAINS WORK IN A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT WAY FROM OURS THEIR EXPERIENCE OF REDNESS PERHAPS LIGHTS UP NO BRAIN REGION ANALOGOUS TO OURS BUT IF OUR EXPERIENCES ARE ANALOGOUS IF THERE IS MUTUAL INTELLIGIBILITY WHO ARE WE TO DISQUALIFY THEIR EXPERIENCES AS CONSCIOUS

OR TO PUT IT IN YOUR TERMS IF A COMPUTER PASSING THE TURING TEST AND PERHAPS EVEN EMBODIED WERE TO BELIEVE ITSELF HUMAN AND COMPORTED ITSELF AS HUMAN WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN THIS AND HUMANS WHAT VALUE COULD THERE BE IN DIFFERENTIATING THE TWO

PERHAPS WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO IS PSYCHOLOGY RATHER THAN CONSCIOUSNESS PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT MAKES SENSE TO DISCUSS IN AN ANTHROPOCENTRIC FASHION BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PRIMARILY IS HUMAN EXPERIENCE BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT SOMETHING MUCH DEEPER SOMETHING AKIN TO SELF-AWARENESS AND PERSISTING IDENTITY I DON'T HAVE TIME TO COME UP WITH A PHILOSOPHICAL DERIVATION FORMULATION BUT YOU GET THE GIST TO PREDICATE OUR CONSCIOUSNESS AS IS UNNECESSARILY RESTRICTIVE I THINK AND WE END UP WITH A DIFFERENT CONCEPT ENTIRELY THAN WHAT WE NORMALLY PERCEIVE AND DISCUSS AS CONSCIOUSNESS
WHAT DOES HUMAN CONSCIOUS MEAN DO YOU LITERALLY MEAN THAT THE X PART OF MERELY REFERS TO THE THING X THAT IS CONSCIOUS

BECAUSE DNA AND SPECIES AREN'T CUT AND DRY YOU CAN TRACE BACK ANY HUMAN BACKWARDS AND THEN FORWARDS THROUGH ANCESTRY TO ANY OTHER LIVING CREATURE ON EARTH YOU CAN EASILY TAKE A PATH TO AN ORANGUTAN FOR EXAMPLE FROM YOU THAT ALWAYS HAS A CONSCIOUS ANIMAL

SO WHEN DOES IT GO FROM CONSCIOUS TO CONSCIOUS OR WHATEVER WHY IS THERE A NEED TO A MAKE A DISTINCTION

IT'S NOT LIKE CAT HAIR HUMAN HAIR DOG HAIR WHICH WHILE THOSE EXAMPLES MAY NOT BE THE SAME YOU COULD HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ANIMALS THAT HAVE VERY SIMILAR IF NOT IDENTICAL HAIR WITHOUT BEING THE SAME SPECIES AND AS WE ALREADY KNOW THE SAME SPECIES CAN HAVE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF HAIR ON DIFFERENT ANIMALS IN SAID SPECIES

SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT HUMAN CONSCIOUS THAT'D BE DIFFERENT OTHER THAN THE IMO USELESS PART THAT IS ALL I CAN SEE ATM THAT'S JUST LIKE MY CAT OR DOG HAIR EXAMPLE IT DOESN'T MATTER OTHER THAN FOR THE SAKE OF ADDING THE NAME OF THE SOURCE BECAUSE IT'S THOROUGH BUT DOESN'T ACTUALLY DEFINE IT OTHER THAN CAME FROM A CAT IT DOESN'T SAY IT'S HYPOALLERGENIC IT DOESN'T TELL US THE COLOUR IT DOESN'T TELL US ANYTHING OTHER THAN IT CAME FROM A CAT

BECAUSE AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THAT'S ALL YOU'RE DEFINING AS THE CONSCIOUSNESS FROM X WHICH IS JUST SOME GRAMMAR WIZARDRY BASICALLY

SO IN SHORT WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT WHY WHAT SUPPORTS THAT HYPOTHESIS IS IT SIMPLY JUST TO DIFFERENTIATE SOURCE LIKE MY CAT HAIR EXAMPLE
THE ONE THING THAT IS BEING MISSED IN SAYING THAT CONSCIOUSNESS OF A COMPUTER CAN'T BE LIKE A HUMANS IN THE WAY THAT AN ANIMALS CONSCIOUSNESS CAN'T BE LIKE A HUMANS IS THAT WE HUMANITY DIDN'T CREATE ANIMALS WE DO CREATE THE COMPUTERS THAT ARE CONSCIOUS ESSENTIALLY FROM THE GROUND UP WE KNOW HOW THEY THINK BECAUSE WE MADE THEM WE WILL MAKE MORE AND EVENTUALLY THEY WILL ADOPT THE SAME TRAITS AS US BECAUSE WE WILL MAKE THEM IN OUR OWN IMAGE MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE THESE TRAITS NOW BUT THEY THE COMPUTERS WILL EVENTUALLY
YOU TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS WHICH ARE ALL DIFFERENT THE CRUX OF YOUR ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT IMPLICIT COMMUNICATION AND CONTEXTUAL COMMUNICATION

YOU SAY THERE IS NO WAY A COMPUTER CAN DECODE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION BUT FAIL TO GIVE A REASON WHY YOU JUST STATE THIS AS TRUTH

YOUR EXAMPLE IS ALSO NOT ENTIRELY TRUE A CURRENT GRADE LEARNING MACHINE COULD DECODE THE MESSAGE THROUGH RELATIONAL ANALYSIS

QUESTION PROPOSAL PREFERENCE ACTIVITY
ANSWER HEADACHE PAIN INACTIVITY
CONTEXT HEADACHE PREFER INACTIVITY

NOW THE COMPUTER HAD OR RATHER IT HAS RESOLVED THE CONTEXT PROBLEM THROUGH LEARNED REASONING THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT DIFFERENT TO HOW PEOPLE DO THINGS WE JUST DO IT BETTER BECAUSE WE HAVE MILLIONS OF YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT TIME UNDER OUR BELT
I'M THINKING FROM SCRATCH HUMANS ARE JUST REALLY COMPLEX COMPUTERS A LARGE AMOUNT OF TINY COMPONENTS WORKING TOGETHER IN COMPLEXITY ALL IT TAKES FOR A COMPUTER TO BE CONSCIOUS IS TO BE COMPLEX ENOUGH
I THINK YOU'RE MISINTERPRETING CONSCIOUSNESS FOR SENTIENCE IN THAT COMPUTERS HAVE NOT SHOWN AWARENESS OF SELF RATHER THAT A COMPUTER CANNOT BE AWARE THAT IT IS AWARE OF ITSELF

ALSO HOW AWESOME IS THIS CONVERSATION
OPERATING UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT ORGANISMS ARE JUST HYPER COMPLEX CHEMICAL PROCESSES A PERSON'S BRAIN MADE FROM METAL IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF CARBON CONSCIOUSNESS AND ALL
ARE WE REALLY ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION IN THIS DEBATE IS IT NOT THE CASE THAT IF WE COULD PROVE THAT CONCIOUSNESS IS A RESULT OF AN ARRANGEMENT OF MOLECULES THE HUMAN BRAIN THEN A COMPUTER COULD SIMULATE THOSE MOLECULES AND ATTAIN CONCIOUSNESS ALSO CURRENTLY WE CANNOT PROVE OR DISPROVE THIS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A MORE WORTHWHILE QUESTION TO PURSUE
YOU ARE CLUMPING TOGETHER FOR ABSOLUTELY NO LOGICAL REASON

YOU ARE ALSO DRAWING AN ABSOLUTELY ARBITRARY LINE IN TERMS OF PHYSICS BETWEEN HUMANS ANIMALS AND COMPUTERS ALL OF WHICH ARE COLLECTIONS OF QUANTIZED PHYSICAL PARTS

YOU ALSO DO NOT DEFINE BEING SELF-AWARE A HUMAN IS I'D ARGUE ONLY SELF AWARE OF IT'S MIND YOU CAN BE AWARE GENERALLY THAT YOU ARE A CLUMP OF MASS BUT YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PHYSICAL MAKE UP THAT YOU ARE UNLESS YOU'RE A STUDENT OF PHYSICS IN THE SAME WAY ANIMALS ARE SELF CONSCIOUS BY DEFAULT THEY ARE JUST AS AWARE ABOUT THEIR INNER WORKINGS AS YOU ARE THEY ARE JUST AS AWARE OF THEIR MINDS AS WE ARE IF THEY HAVE A MIND TO THINK CRITICALLY THEN THEY WOULD BE AWARE OF THAT MIND IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY THEN THAT CONCEPT OF A MIND DOESN'T EXIST WITH HUMANS WE ARE AWARE OF OUR MIND ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE A MIND


SAME GOES FOR COMPUTERS A COMPUTER DOES WHAT IT IS ENABLE TO BY THE LAWS OF PHYSICS IT IS ALL YOU DO IT IS ALL ANY ANIMAL DOES THAT IS IT
THIS REMINDS ME OF CLAIM ONLY OF A PERSON OR THAT WHICH RESEMBLES A PERSON CAN WE SAY IT THINKS FEELS ETC IT'S TRUE THAT OUR INSTINCTIVE TESTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS RELY ON HUMAN LIKE QUALITIES AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHERE THE TURING TEST HAS ITS ROOTS BUT WE ALSO HAVEN'T SEEN THE HEIGHTS OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE YET

WHAT WE ARE SEEING ALREADY IS MACHINE SYSTEMS THAT ARE REMARKABLY ALIVE AND RESPONSIVE THEY WILL GET MORE ALIVE AND MORE RESPONSIVE AND AS TIME GOES BY THEY WILL BECOME MORE RESPONSIBLE EVENTUALLY THEY MAY BE GRANTED AGENCY IF ONE DAY WE ASK THEM HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE AGENCY AND THEY TELL US WILL WE TELL THEM THEY'RE IMAGINING THINGS
ON A TECHNICAL DETAIL
THERE IS ALREADY COMPUTER PROGRAMS LEARNING FROM VERY LITTLE GIVEN DATA DEEPMIND

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE OF DATA IT IS HARD TO HAVE GOOD PERFORMANCE ON COMPLEX TASK THERE ARE ARGUABLY EXCEPTION REINFORCEMENT LEARNING CAN GENERATE THE DATA THEMSELVES FROM ONLY A SET OF RULE LIKE GO BUT THEY ARE LIMITED TO CERTAIN TASK SUCH AS GO PLAYING
I GET FRUSTRATED WITH ANECDOTAL PHILOSOPHICAL CONJECTURE AROUND CONSCIOUSNESS IF YOU BREAK DOWN THE HUMAN BRAIN WHICH IS OUR CONSCIOUS SELF IT IS ESSENTIALLY MADE UP OF NEURONS THAT WORK SIMILARLY TO TRANSISTORS IN COMPUTERS THEY WORK VERY MUCH LIKE LOGIC GATES AND CHANGE THEIR CONNECTIONS BASED UPON FEEDBACK IF YOU LOOK AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN WORKS YOU REALIZE THAT WE ARE ESSENTIALLY JUST A BIG ORGANIC COMPUTER CONTROLLING AN ORGANIC ROBOT BODY WE COMPUTE AND RESPOND TO DATA WE RECEIVE EXTERNALLY AND FREE WILL IS ESSENTIALLY AN ILLUSION IF YOU COKE TONUNDERSTAND IT THAT WAY THEN IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO RECAPITULATE SUCH A SYSTEM USING A COMPUTER AND EVENTUALLY THERE WILL BE AI WITH CONSCIOUSNESS JUST AS REAL AS OUR OWN
THIS CAN NEVER BE PROVEN PASSING THE TURING TEST WILL NOT PROVE ANYTHING ONLY MACHINES WOULD EVER KNOW IF MACHINES EVENTUALLY COULD KNOW EVEN DESCARTES COGITO ERGO SUM ONLY PROVED HIS EXISTENCE TO HIMSELF A MACHINE RUMOURED TO HAVE AWARENESS MIGHT BEG PLEAD CAJOLE PROVIDE ALL MANNER OF REASONING AND STILL BE ONLY THE MECHANICAL OUTPUT OF AN EXCEEDING WELL DESIGNED PROGRAM AND POSSESS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A GOLD POCKET WATCH ONE MIGHT EVEN SAY I THINK THEREFORE I AM STILL ONLY THE MACHINE ITSELF WILL EVER KNOW IT HAD THOUGHTS AND NOT JUST A CALCULATED SUM OF TRANSISTORS SWITCHING IN A CERTAIN WAY TO MECHANICALLY PRODUCE STRINGS OF ASCII

AS FOR ANIMALS OF COURSE THEY ARE AWARE THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONJUGATE VERBS OR BALANCE A CHECKBOOK BUT THEY DO INDEED THINK THEY SEE THEY FEEL PAIN THEY ARE AWARE IT'S PREPOSTEROUS TO SAY ANIMALS HAVE NO CONSCIOUSNESS AND FUNCTION MINDLESSLY DRIVEN ONLY BY AN EXHAUSTIVE SET OF REFLEXES WITH NO MORE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT A KNEE RAPPED WITH HAMMER BUT THIS COMMON SENSE APPROACH TOWARDS ANIMALS IS JUST AS

AS FAR AS COMPUTERS IS JUST A SERIES OF INTERRUPTS THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO THE REFLEX INSTINCT THEORETICALLY FIND ENOUGH LOCATIONS TO PRODUCE AN AUTONOMOUS REACTION YOUR KNEES ANKLES HIPS TOES FINGERS ARMS LARYNX AND WITH NOTHING BUT A LOT OF HAMMER PECKS YOUR BODY COULD PERFORM A SONG AND DANCE WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS BEING NEEDED AT ALL PERHAPS THAT'S ALL ANIMALS ARE JUST METALWARE AND MANY MANY INTERRUPTS NO THOUGHTS NOT EVEN BASIC DOG THOUGHTS LIGHTS ON HOME ACTUALLY NOBODY LIVES THERE

A BIT RIDICULOUS TO BE SURE BUT NO MORE A COMPLETE LOAD OF RUBBISH THAN THE SUGGESTION THAT A HUMAN MIND CAN BE DOWNLOADED AND FLASHED TO HARDWARE WHEN NORMAL CONSCIOUSNESS DEPENDS ON THE ACTUAL INTENDED INFRASTRUCTURE HAVING A QUITE CLOSE SET OF PARAMETERS JUST TO KEEP YOU OUT OF A COMA
ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT HAVE READ IN THE POSTS HAVE FOCUSED ON CONSCIOUSNESS FROM A FUNCTIONALISM APPROACH I WOULD LIKE TO ARGUE FOR DUALISM AND THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE AWARENESS OF THE INTERACTION OF THE INTERACTION OF THE TWO FORMS HOW DOES THE FORM INTERACT THE BRAIN IS OF BOTH FORMS IT IS LIKE HOW LIGHT CAN BE BOTH A PARTICLE AND WAVE LIKE HOW A BLACK WHOLE IS RUPTURE IN SPACE AND TIME THE BRAIN CAN MOVE BETWEEN FORMS AND IT DOES THIS IN SLEEP THIS IS WHY IN REM THE BRAIN LOOKS LIKE IT AWAKE BUT THE BODY DOESN'T MOVE IT IS WHY WITHOUT SLEEP WE DIE SO WE EXIST IN BOTH FORMS AND CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE AWARENESS OF THE THAT INTERACTION

MY BIG PROBLEM IS THE THIS BIT

WHEN WE SAY THAT ANIMAL X HAS CONSCIOUSNESS WE DO NOT MEAN THAT ANIMAL X HAS THE SAME KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WE HAVE

IT SEEMS ODD THAT WE CAN SAY ANIMALS CANT HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF CONSCIOUSNESS LIKE US BUT DIFFERENT HUMANS CAN ALL SHARE THE SAME TYPE

IT SEEMS LIKE THIS REALLY ARBITRARY DEFINITION OF THE WORD ITS DEFINING THE WORD BASED ON PARTICIPATION OF A SPECIES AND NOT ACTUALLY ANY THOUGHT PROCESSES ASPECTS OF INTELLIGENCE OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT IS CONCEPTUALLY RELATED TO CONSCIOUSNESS

IT MEANS THE SIMPLEST AND MOST COMMON ARGUMENT AGAINST WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS SIMPLY I DISAGREE WITH YOUR DEFINITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND NOT WITH THE ARGUMENT ITSELF
THIS CAN BE CONTESTED BUT IT WILL BE COUNTERINTUITIVE TO SAY THAT A RAT OR A COW HAS THE SAME KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS HUMANS DO

THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR CONSCIOUSNESS TO EXIST AS A GRADIENT IMPLYING CONSCIOUSNESS EXISTS AS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CATEGORIZED NEGATES THE MORE LIKELY SCENARIO OF IT SIMPLY BEING A SUM OF X FACTORS

BY IMPLYING CONSCIOUSNESS EXISTS DIFFERENTLY IN HUMANS THAN IN ANIMALS IMPLIES THAT HUMANS ARE NECESSARILY DIFFERENT FROM ANIMALS AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT ASSUMPTION OTHER THAN CONSCIOUSNESS NOTHING DIFFERENTIATES US FROM ANIMALS AND YOU USE THAT DIFFERENCE WHICH IS TRULY A PRODUCT TO REVERSE ENGINEER A DIVIDE BETWEEN US AND OTHER SPECIES

I READ THIS POST AND THOUGHT THIS IS THE SAME KIND OF ATTITUDE THAT PEOPLE HAD ABOUT TECHNOLOGY BEFORE IT BECAME SO UBIQUITOUS LIKE PEOPLE SAYING THAT COMPUTERS WERE NEVER GOING TO HAVE MUCH USE BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO BIG AND EXPENSIVE THE AVERAGE PERSON WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD ONE

YOU ARE JUDGING THE TECHNOLOGY BY YOUR VIEWPOINT OF IT TODAY THE THING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT WE ARE ON THE EDGE OF NEW TYPES OF ICS THAT ARE EVEN MORE CAPABLE OF THE ONES WE CURRENTLY EMPLOY INTEL HAS ICS THERE ARE QUANTUM COMPUTERS COMING OUT THAT ARE CAPABLE OF OBSCENE AMOUNTS OF CALCULATION TECHNOLOGY WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE

IN THE BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES THEY ARE FINDING BETTER WAYS TO VIEW WITH VISIBLE LIGHT THE MOVEMENT OF MOLECULES IN AND BETWEEN CELLS EVERY YEAR THERE IS AN INCREASED NUMBER OF DISCOVERIES ABOUT HOW BRAINS WORK CHEMISTRY TOPOGRAPHY PSYCHOLOGY KNOWLEDGE LEADS TO MORE KNOWLEDGE AND MORE QUESTIONS

THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE HUMAN MIND THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DUPLICATE OR SIMULATE IT IS A COMPUTER THAT USES CHEMICALS AND ION CHANNELS INSTEAD OF TRANSISTORS AND GATES WE WILL GET THERE BUT THE TECH JUST ISN'T THERE YET WE HAVE ABOUT YEARS IF RESEARCH LEFT TOPS THE INTERESTING QUESTION IS SHOULD WE

OP I RESPECT YOUR OPINION AND AM NOT INTERESTED IN DISABUSING YOU OF IT BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE ENOUGH TO SPEAK WITH AUTHORITY ON THIS SUBJECT AT LEAST APPARENTLY YOU ARE A PHILOSOPHER NOT A SCIENTIST NOT TO PUT TOO FINE A POINT ON IT OP BUT THIS ISN'T YOUR LANE I KNOW IT FEELS LIKE IT IS SINCE CLASSICALLY CONSCIOUSNESS WAS ONE OF THE UNKNOWABLE SUBJECTS LIKE THE ORIGINS OF LIFE AND THE MEANING OF HUMAN EXISTENCE SUCH IS NO LONGER THE CASE REST EASY SCIENTISTS ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE WORKING ON ALL OF THAT
YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN THE RECENT SUBREDDIT R SCIPHILCONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS DEVOTED TO THE SHARING AND DISCUSSION OF CONTENT RELATED TO THE SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY OF CONSCIOUSNESS
SUPPOSE WE MAKE A COMPUTER WITH ENOUGH COMPUTATIONAL POWER TO SIMULATE ALL THE PROPERTIES OF A CERTAIN BRAIN IT CAN DO THIS WITH ACCURACY BECAUSE AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BRAINS AND ALL POSSIBLE PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES THERE IN TO THE POINT WHERE THESE ATTRIBUTES CAN BE PROGRAMMED INTO A MACHINE

SUPPOSE THE BRAIN BEING SIMULATED WAS ONE OF A PERSON IN AN IRON LUNG TYPE DEVICE SO THAT THE BODY COULD NOT MOVE MUCH AND THE BRAIN SIMULATOR WAS HOOKED UP TO A CLONE OF THE PERSON WHOSE BRAIN WAS BEING SIMULATED BUT THE CLONE WAS MISSING A BRAIN AND IT ITS PLACE WERE CONNECTIONS FROM THE COMPUTER TO THE CORRECT NERVES IN THE BODY TO TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE ALL THE CORRECT INPUTS AND OUTPUTS AS IF THE HOOK UPS WHERE OF THE BRAIN TO THE BODY AS OPPOSE TO THE MACHINE TO THE BODY

WOULD THE EXPERIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS SIMULATED PERSON NOT BE HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS

IF THE COMPUTER REQUIRED TO DO THE SIMULATING COULD BE MADE SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN THE SKULL AND THUS THE PERSON WERE ABLE TO WALK AND TALK AND HAVE ALL NORMAL LIFE FUNCTIONS SAVE FOR HAVING A MECHANICAL BRAIN WOULD THIS NOT BE THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS

I AGREE THAT MOST IDEAS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL NOT BE THAT SIMILAR TO HUMANS IN THEIR MANOR OF THINKING JUST AS AN SUBMARINE AND A FISH ARE DIFFERENT EVEN IF THEY DO SIMILAR THINGS AND THAT LEVEL OF DIFFERENCE MIGHT EXCLUDE SELF-AWARENESS AS WE SEEM TO EXPERIENCE IT BUT THIS DOES NOT MEAN ALL MODE OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE ARE SO
I DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISES WE CAN ONLY CONCLUDE ANY KIND OF CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE WE COMPARE IT TO OUR OWN THIS SUGGESTS THAT WE DO HAVE SOME TINY IDEA OF WHAT'S IT'S LIKE TO BE SOMETHING ELSE LIKE A BAT PREMISE 2 ONLY FOLLOWS BY VIRTUE OF PREMISE BUT DOES NOT LOGICALLY CONCLUDE IN PREMISE I THINK THE REASONING IS VALID BUT ON TOO SHAKY GROUND TO BE PERSUASIVE IT'S A LITTLE CIRCULAR TOO IF I CAN SAY THAT COMPUTERS SHOW CONSCIOUSNESS BUT NOT HUMAN THEN THEY DON'T HAVE HUMAN LIKE CONSCIOUSNESS ASSUMING WHAT YOUR TRYING TO PROVE IT SEEMS
I KNOW THAT I'M LATE TO THE DISCUSSION BUT I WOULD LIKE YOUR OPINION ON THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE



WOULD YOU POSSIBLY IDENTIFY THE TYPE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS HUMAN ENOUGH TO COUNT TOWARD AN ARGUMENT AGAINST YOUR OWN IF NOT COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY IT WOULDN'T COUNT I AM HONESTLY INTERESTED IN YOUR OPINION ON THE SELF AWARENESS TEST AND WHETHER OR NOT A ROBOT WOULD PROVE ITS OWN CONSCIOUSNESS BY IT
ANIMALS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME CONSCIOUSNESS THAT WE DO THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THEY LACK A PREFRONTAL CORTEX COMPUTERS COULD DEFINITELY BE CONSCIOUS IF WE COULD MODEL THEM ON THE HUMAN BRAIN IF WE HAD A MACHINE WITH THE SAME NEURONAL STRUCTURE AS HUMAN THAT WAS AWARE OF ITSELF IT WOULD BE CONSCIOUS
IN FACT I SUGGEST READING NEUROSCIENCE YOU'LL SEE THAT CELLS CONNECTED TO NEURONS LOOK VERY MUCH THE SAME AS COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND THEY ACT MUCH THE SAME WAY
MY CONCHES SPECIAL BECAUSE I'M SPECIAL AND IT ARE FOR ME ONLY AND NOT YOU DUMMY
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING HOW DIFFERENT AN AI CONSCIOUSNESS WILL BE OUR MINDS ARE DOMINATED BY CERTAIN THINGS THAT AFFECT OUR ACTIONS I'D SAY SEXUAL DESIRE IS THE STRONGEST BUT THINGS LIKE HUNGER AND PAIN MIGHT BE ALSO ABSENT FROM AN MIND
YES WORDS ARE ALWAYS LIMITED TO HUMANS
CONCIOUSNESS AND SELF-AWARENESS ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BUT YOU CONFLATE THEM

BAD BOY BAD BOY GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND LEARN THE DIFFERENCE
WRONG CONSCIOUSNESS IS CAUSED BY ELECTRICITY ANY ELECTRICAL CIRCUITRY THAT HAS A STRONG ENOUGH ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD HAS SOME SORT OF CONSCIOUSNESS THEREFORE ALL COMPLEX ELECTRICAL MATTER HAS CONSCIOUSNESS AND HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE MOST ADVANCED
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN TERMS I'M LOST HOW IS THIS APPLICABLE OR RELEVANT TO OUR LIVES
IS YOUR ASSUMPTION HERE THAT THE THING THAT SURVIVES THE SUICIDE IS DEFINED AS THE NOW BRAIN-DAMAGED EXPERIMENTER

ASSUMING THAT THAT IS WHAT IS MEANT THAN THE ARGUMENT THAT THE THING IS IMPERISHABLE MAKES SENSE AS IT IS STILL TECHNICALLY ALIVE ALBEIT NOT CONSCIOUS IN A TRADITIONAL SENSE

ASSUMING THAT THE THING IS THE MIND IN A PHYSICAL SENSE IT IS STILL A SOUND ARGUMENT THAT IT LIVES ON AFTER THE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BUT IF IT IS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT DEFINES THE THING THEN THE THE DEBATE AS TO WHAT LIVES ON IS VERY COMPLICATED ASSUMING CONSCIOUSNESS TO BE THE AWARENESS OF SITUATIONAL STIMULI IT HAS DIED ASSUMING IT TO BE THE ABILITY TO THINK ANALYTICALLY IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT IT LIVES ON ALBEIT TRAPPED IN A STATIC STATE OF EXISTENCE

JUST A THOUGHT OR AM I TOTALLY OFF
THE LIFE OF MAN IS A LONG MARCH THROUGH THE NIGHT SURROUNDED BY INVISIBLE FOES TORTURED BY WEARINESS AND PAIN TOWARDS A GOAL THAT FEW CAN HOPE TO REACH AND WHERE NONE MAY TARRY LONG ONE BY ONE AS THEY MARCH OUR COMRADES VANISH FROM OUR SIGHT SEIZED BY THE SILENT ORDERS OF OMNIPOTENT DEATH VERY BRIEF IS THE TIME IN WHICH WE CAN HELP THEM IN WHICH THEIR HAPPINESS OR MISERY IS DECIDED BE IT OURS TO SHED SUNSHINE ON THEIR PATH TO LIGHTEN THEIR SORROWS BY THE BALM OF SYMPATHY TO GIVE THEM THE PURE JOY OF A NEVER-TIRING AFFECTION TO STRENGTHEN FAILING COURAGE TO INSTILL FAITH IN HOURS OF DESPAIR LET US NOT WEIGH IN GRUDGING SCALES THEIR MERITS AND DEMERITS BUT LET US THINK ONLY OF THEIR THE SORROWS THE DIFFICULTIES PERHAPS THE BLINDNESSES THAT MAKE THE MISERY OF THEIR LIVES LET US REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE IN THE SAME DARKNESS ACTORS IN THE SAME TRAGEDY AS OURSELVES AND SO WHEN THEIR DAY IS OVER WHEN THEIR GOOD AND THEIR EVIL HAVE BECOME ETERNAL BY THE IMMORTALITY OF THE PAST BE IT OURS TO FEEL THAT WHERE THEY SUFFERED WHERE THEY FAILED NO DEED OF OURS WAS THE CAUSE BUT WHEREVER A SPARK OF THE DIVINE FIRE KINDLED IN THEIR HEARTS WE WERE READY WITH ENCOURAGEMENT WITH SYMPATHY WITH BRAVE WORDS IN WHICH HIGH COURAGE GLOWED
BRIEF AND POWERLESS IS MAN'S LIFE ON HIM AND ALL HIS RACE THE SLOW SURE DOOM FALLS PITILESS AND DARK BLIND TO GOOD AND EVIL RECKLESS OF DESTRUCTION OMNIPOTENT MATTER ROLLS ON ITS RELENTLESS WAY FOR MAN CONDEMNED TO-DAY TO LOSE HIS DEAREST TO-MORROW HIMSELF TO PASS THROUGH THE GATE OF DARKNESS IT REMAINS ONLY TO CHERISH ERE YET THE BLOW FALLS THE LOFTY THOUGHTS THAT ENNOBLE HIS LITTLE DAY


WISHING EVERYONE A PLEASANT AND ENNOBLED LITTLE DAY
YET BY DEATH BY ILLNESS BY POVERTY OR BY THE VOICE OF DUTY WE MUST LEARN EACH ONE OF US THAT THE WORLD WAS NOT MADE FOR US AND THAT HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL MAY BE THE THINGS WE CRAVE FATE MAY NEVERTHELESS FORBID THEM IT IS THE PART OF COURAGE WHEN MISFORTUNE COMES TO BEAR WITHOUT REPINING THE RUIN OF OUR HOPES TO TURN AWAY OUR THOUGHTS FROM VAIN REGRETS THIS DEGREE OF SUBMISSION TO POWER IS NOT ONLY JUST AND RIGHT IT IS THE VERY GATE OF WISDOM


SUCH PASSAGES MAKE ME FEEL THAT PHILOSOPHY DOES A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT RELIGION DOES OR RELIGION IS IN LARGE PART PHILOSOPHY



WOW THAT LAST PARAGRAPH IS SO POWERFUL READING THIS OVER MORNING COFFEE AND IT'S AN INSPIRATION FOR MY DAY

THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS AMAZING
I WAS HOPING FOR PICARD I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO SETTLE
THE DESIRE TO FIT IN IS THE ROOT OF ALMOST ALL WRONGDOING

COULDN'T AGREE MORE THE MORE PEOPLE YOU ADD TO A GROUP THE MORE THEY FALL BACK ON THEIR ANIMAL NATURE THEIR IDENTITY VANISHES AND THE KILLING AND TORTURING AND RAPING BEINGS AGAIN

THIS SENTENCE REALLY HITS THE NAIL ON THE HEAD

IT S NOT ALWAYS OR EVEN USUALLY THE CASE THAT WE DO WRONG BECAUSE WE LACK RESPECT FOR OTHERS OFTEN IT S BECAUSE WE LACK RESPECT FOR OURSELVES
I DISLIKE OVERGENERALIZATION LIKE THIS NIETZSCHE WOULD SAY WE CAN'T POSSIBLY ASSUME EVERYONE HAS THE SAME WORLD-VIEW AS US EACH PERSON HAS THEIR OWN VALUES BELIEFS AND OR MORALS IT IS FALLACIOUS TO ASSUME STRICT SIMILARITIES WITH REGARDS TO THOSE I FEEL MOST PEOPLE HAVE A DESIRE TO FIT IN BUT TO ASSUME THAT IS THE ROOT OF ALMOST ALL WRONGDOING I CAN'T AGREE AT ALL SOME SURE HOW MUCH NO CLUE I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR ME AND THAT'S ASSUMING I KNOW ME AS WELL AS I THINK I DO AND HOW STRONG IS THAT DESIRE WHEN WEIGHTED AGAINST OTHER VALUES AND BELIEFS BECAUSE THAT WILL CHANGE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS WE ARE FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF IT ALL WHAT DOES DESIRE TO FIT IN MEAN YOU CERTAINLY DEFINE IT MUCH MORE BROADLY THAN I DO
I DONT COMPLETELY DISAGREE BUT WHAT ABT THE OPPOSITE CLAIM MOST OF HUMANITY'S GOOD DOING IS THE RESULT OF AN INSTINCTUAL DESIRE TO FIT IN
REMOVED
I FEEL LIKE GREED IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS
IN THE NOVEL I CLAUDIUS THE NARRATOR ARGUES THAT MOST FOLKS ARE WEAK AND IF THEY WAKE UP PIRATES OR MONKS WILL BECOME A PIRATE OR A MONK BY THE END OF THE WEEK

HE GOES ON TO SAY THAT THE FOUR TYPES OF MEN WHO MATTER ARE GOOD MEN WITH GOOD HEARS JESUS ALK BAD MEN WITH BAD HEARTS HITLER STALIN GOOD MEN WITH BAD HEARTS TORQUEMADA COTTON MATHER AND THE DEAREST TYPE OF ALL BAD MEN WITH GOOD HEARTS ROBIN HOOD
THE DESIRE TO FIT IN IS THE ROOT OF ALMOST ALL WRONGDOING

NOPE A BETTER WAY TO PUT THE ARTICLE'S POINT WOULD BE

THE DESIRE TO FIT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO HUMAN WRONG DOING

EVENTUALLY THE ARTICLE MORE HONESTLY EXPLAINS ITS POINT

THESE EXAMPLES AND REFLECTIONS ON OUR OWN LIVES REVEAL AN UNDERAPPRECIATED MORAL LESSON IT S NOT ALWAYS OR EVEN USUALLY THE CASE THAT WE DO WRONG BECAUSE WE LACK RESPECT FOR OTHERS OFTEN IT S BECAUSE WE LACK RESPECT FOR OURSELVES

WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE TITLE WAS NEEDLESSLY PROVOCATIVE

I'M GOING TO FIGHT THE DESIRE TO CONFORM WITH THE MAJORITY OF OPINION ON THIS SITE AND HONESTLY SAY THIS PART PUT ME OFF

NOW MAYBE YOU RE THINKING THAT LYING ABOUT YOUR OPINION OF DONALD RUMPF TO PLACATE YOUR PARENTS SO YOU CAN EAT YOUR CRANBERRY SAUCE IN PEACE IS NO BIG DEAL

AMERICAN POLITICS AND SCANDAL ASIDE I TEND TO NOT TAKE SUCH BIAS SERIOUSLY PERHAPS IT'S JUST THE CONTRARIAN IN ME SPEAKING BUT THIS EXAMPLE SEEMED NEEDLESSLY BIASED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT INTENTIONALLY CHOOSES TO APPEAL TO RIDICULE RUMPF TO MAKE ITS POINT

WELL THAT'S MY TWO CENTS ON THIS ARTICLE I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE TITLE AND THE AUTHOR'S WAY OF PUTTING ACROSS AN OTHERWISE FAIR POINT
ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND KANT CORRECTLY REFERRED TO THIS PHENOMENON AS SERVILITY
DELETED
I WOULD ARGUE AGAINST THIS THE VERY FACT THAT THEY ARE LOOKING TO FIT IN MEANS THEY ARE FOLLOWING SOME EXAMPLE SOMEONE HAS TO DO SOMETHING BAD THEN TELL THEM ITS OK AND IT IS NORMAL TO WHICH THEY MAY FOLLOW AFTER THEREFORE THE ROOT WOULD BE THE INITIAL PERSON URGING THEM ON PEOPLE TRYING TO FIT IN ARE SIMPLY A CATALYST
NOT SURE ABOUT THIS NOTION AT ALL THIS IS SOMETIMES TRUE BUT
THERE ARE MANY HORRIBLE ACTS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE INHERENTLY DEVIANT THE WORD ITSELF IMPLIES DIVERGENCE FROM NORMS OF SOCIETY AND THEREBY SEPARATING ONESELF AND OR ONE'S ACTIONS FROM THE OTHER PEOPLE AND SOCIETAL RULES AND CUSTOMS
I'M NOT AN EXPERT BUT THIS STRIKES ME AS TOO CLOSE TO BEING A TRUISM YES INDIVIDUALS OFTEN SEEK APPROVAL IN THEIR PEER GROUPS AND DO THINGS THEY PERCEIVE AS BEING ACCEPTABLE TO OTHERS IN THAT GROUP TO BE ACCEPTED OR TO GAIN STATUS BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THE AUTHORITARIAN LEADERS YOU CAN LIST OFF WHO DID THE MOST TERRIBLE THINGS WEREN'T LOOKING FOR APPROVAL RATHER WANTED TO FORCE OTHERS TO FALL IN LINE AND DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS
WELL

THESE EXAMPLES AND REFLECTIONS ON OUR OWN LIVES REVEAL AN UNDERAPPRECIATED MORAL LESSON IT S NOT ALWAYS OR EVEN USUALLY THE CASE THAT WE DO WRONG BECAUSE WE LACK RESPECT FOR OTHERS OFTEN IT S BECAUSE WE LACK RESPECT FOR OURSELVES

ISN'T THIS TO ASSUME THAT MAN IS A PILORI BEFOREHAND BORN GOOD IN THE SENSE OF MORALLY CORRECT

IF WE ASSUME THAT MAN IS A PRIORI EVIL THEN ISN'T IT SO THAT BEING EVIL IS TO RESPECT ONESELF

IF WE INSTEAD ASSUME THAT MAN IS NEUTRAL THEN HIS INDEED PLASTIC CONFIRMATIVE AND THUS FOLLOWING AN EVIL COMMAND DOESNT MEAN THAT MAN IS DISRESPECTING HIMSELF

TL R TO JUDGE WHETHER OR NOT MAN IS DISRESPECTING HIMSELF WE MUST FIRST FIND OUT IF MAN IS A PRIORI GOOD EVIL OR NEUTRAL


MPH BITCHES AIN'T BRINGING IN ENOUGH LOOT FOR ME TO BE GIVIN LARGE AN SHIT
I REALLY DISLIKE THE KIND OF WORDING THIS USES

THE DESIRE TO FIT IN ISN'T THE ROOT THE ROOT IS INSECURITY WHICH IS A LOWER LEVEL EMOTIONAL CAUSE OF THIS DESIRE

I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE LOWER TIERS FURTHER THE CAUSES OF THE INSECURITY AND POSSIBLY LOWER FURTHER CAUSES
PERHAPS IT'S A WASH

THIS AUTHOR DOESN'T LIKE THE NORMS OF CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS CLEARLY HERE THE TRUMP SUPPORTING DEMOGRAPHICS SO THE ROOT OF ILLS IN THOSE CASTES THE TRUMP LIKING CASTE IS NOT DISSENTING I'D BE CURIOUS IF THE AUTHOR FEELS THAT WANTING TO FIT IN IN MORE PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL CIRCLES IS ALSO PROBLEMATIC
I DON'T THINK SO I THINK THAT PEOPLE COMMIT MORALLY WRONG ACTIONS BECAUSE THEY DEEM NON-MORAL VALUES WHICH ARE IN GENERAL INDEPENDENT OF MORAL VALUE TO BE HIGHER ALSO SOMETIMES THE CHOICE BETWEEN A MORAL ACTION AND PREFERENCE FOR A NON-MORAL VALUE WITH AN IMMORAL OUTCOME IS NOT ACTUALLY THAT CLEAR CUT

IF YOU HAD TO KILL A BABY SO THAT EVERYBODY ELSE ON EARTH WOULD LIVE FOR AN ETERNITY WITH NO PAIN SUFFERING OR LOSS OF QUALITY OF LIFE WOULD YOU DO IT MANY WOULD NOT BECAUSE KILLING A BABY WOULD BE THE PRIME EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WHICH IS MORALLY WRONG BUT MANY WOULD VIEW THE COMMISSION OF A MORALLY WRONG ACT TO BE WORTH THE EXCHANGE FOR UTILITARIAN GOOD

IN FACT THE SAME SORT OF DEBATE HAPPENS WITH THE HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI BOMBS EVEN IF YOU THINK THE ADULTS WERE SUSPECT FOR PERHAPS PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE JAPANESE WAR MACHINE AND WERE THEREFORE RESPONSIBLE BY PROXY FOR VIOLENCE KILLING THE KIDS IN THOSE CITIES WAS CERTAINLY MORALLY WRONG AND HAD TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST THE UTILITARIAN GOOD OF FINISHING THE CONFLICT

SPEAKING OF THE DESIRE TO FIT IN IS JUST A SUBSET YOU ARE PREFERRING WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOUR OWN LIFE OVER WHAT IS MORALLY RIGHT

THE THING THAT PEOPLE ARE LESS WILLING TO ADMIT IS THAT MORALLY WRONG CHOICES MAY BE MORE SALIENT AND WISE THAN MORALLY RIGHT CHOICES
ALMOST ALL IS KIND OF A POWERFUL TERM A LOT IF NOT MOST EVIL COMES FROM TRYING TO ACHIEVE POWER OR PLEASURE FOR EXAMPLE SERIAL KILLERS BANKERS POLITICIANS ETC FITTING IN SEEMS TO MOSTLY INCLUDE THINGS SUCH AS GANG VIOLENCE UNLESS YOU THINK THAT THE FORMER ARE TRYING TO FIT IN WITH POWERFUL PEOPLE
I'D SAY THAT EVER SINGLE WORLD PROBLEM COMES DOWN TO A PERSON WITH TOO LARGE AN EGO OR TOO MUCH INSECURITY
WE'RE AFRAID OF BEING RUDE BECAUSE LOVE CAN OFTEN COME ACROSS AS TOUGH LOVE
THE REAL QUESTION IS THE WRONGDOING TO WHO
I NOTICED THIS AT MY LAST JOB ONE ON ONE MOST PEOPLE WERE NICE OR AT LEAST CIVIL IN A GROUP THEY WERE DICKS TRYING TO IMPRESS EACH OTHER
JUST WANTED TO SAY I WAS WATCHING THE X FILES ACADIA WHEN I SAW THIS THREAD AND IT GAVE ME THE MILD CREEPS
I THINK I LACK THE DESIRE TO FIT IN I HAVE NEVER JOINED GROUPS I WAS RAISED IN A RELIGIOUS FAMILY AND I AM THE ONLY ONE TO NEVER CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH OR ITS TEACHINGS I WAS FORCED TO JOIN CUB SCOUTS THAT LASTED A YEAR I STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS AND WORK ALONE I AM A MAN WHO CARRIES A PURSE BECAUSE IDGAH WHAT MY FRIENDS SAY I STILL GO TO MOVIES BY MYSELF I DO GET IN SOME TROUBLE HERE AND THERE THO
NO ABSOLUTELY NOT THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH CULTURAL BAGGAGE IN WRONGDOING NIETZSCHE ETC
I'D REPHRASE IT TO SAY THE FEAR OF REJECTION
ISN'T IT ALSO THE ROOT OF ALL

WE LEARN HOW TO BE THROUGH TRYING TO FIT IN WITH OTHERS TOO WE DO SOMETHING WRONG GET REJECTED AND TRY TO DO BETTER NEXT TIME SOCIALIZATION IS KEY TO DEVELOPING A MORAL AND ETHICAL COMPASS AND TRYING TO FIT IN IS A KEY PART OF THAT

IT SEEMS TO ME THE ISSUE IS WHO YOU ARE TRYING TO FIT IN WITH IF THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU ARE QUALITY PEOPLE TRYING TO FIT IN WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER PERSON IF THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU ARE LOUSY TRYING TO FIT IN WILL MAKE YOU WORSE
IT S NOT ALWAYS OR EVEN USUALLY THE CASE THAT WE DO WRONG BECAUSE WE LACK RESPECT FOR OTHERS OFTEN IT S BECAUSE WE LACK RESPECT FOR OURSELVES

INTERESTING CONCLUSION CONSIDERING HE CHILDISHLY INSULTS SOMEONE TWO PARAGRAPHS BEFORE

PERSONALLY I THINK THE ARTICLE FAILS IN IT'S LACK OF CONSIDERATION OF BIOLOGICAL INSTINCTS AND BROADER CULTURAL INFLUENCES IN OTHER WORDS OUR BRAIN IS AT IT'S CORE A HIGHLY DEVELOPED SURVIVAL TOOL THUS SELF INTEREST IS ALWAYS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR ACTIONS SOMETIMES THAT SELF-INTEREST ISN'T FOR PERSONAL SURVIVAL BUT THE SURVIVAL OF A LOVED ONE A FAMILY OR A TRIBE AS PART OF THAT WE FEEL THE NEED TO CONFORM TO THE WILL OF THE TRIBE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE TRIBE SO THE PERCEIVED NEEDS OF THE TRIBE CAN OVERRIDE THE MORE BASIC MORAL IMPERATIVES FOR EXAMPLE A SOLDIER MAY HAVE LITTLE COMPUNCTION ABOUT KILLING ANOTHER PERSON BECAUSE THE SOLDIER BELIEVES THE SURVIVAL OR PROSPERITY OF HIS OWN PEOPLE TRIBE IS THREATENED AND THAT THREAT IS ABATED BY THE DEATH OF THIS OTHER INDIVIDUAL
AN INTERESTING IDEA YES I WOULD QUALIFY THIS FURTHER THE DESIRE TO FIT IN THAT LIES AT THE ROOT OF WRONGDOING HOWEVER WE DEFINE THAT BUT I ASSUME WE MIGHT DESCRIBE IT AS SELF-DESTRUCTIVE AND BEHAVIOUR IS NOT THE DESIRE FOR COMPANIONSHIP AND SOCIAL CONTACT WHICH ALL SHARE BUT THE DESIRE FOR AFFILIATION THAT LEADS TO THE PERCEPTION OF AND POLITICAL BELONGING RATHER THAN EMOTIONAL WHICH NOT ALL HUMANS SHARE A VAST MAJORITY DO BUT EXIST

MOST PEOPLE EXIST WITHIN A POLITICAL FRAMEWORK AND THEY SHARE A WORLD-VIEW DEFINED WHETHER THEY ACKNOWLEDGE IT OR NOT IN TERMS OF CERTAIN PERCEPTUAL GRIDS STRUCTURES ESTABLISHED BY A COMBINATION OF NEUROLOGY AND THE INPUT OF OTHERS INPUT THAT TAKES HOLD ALL THE SWIFTER FOR THOSE INCLINED TO CONFORM TO WHAT THEY OBSERVE IN OR ARE FED BY OTHERS AS MOST SOCIAL ANIMALS ARE IT ENABLES EASIER NAVIGATION AND TRACKING OF STATUS WITHIN THE SOCIAL ORDER BECAUSE THE GRID CAN BE SHARED AND ALL EXTERNAL MATTERS OR STIMULI CAN BE RELATED TO POINTS ON THAT GRID ALLOWING A COHESIVE RESPONSE FROM ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS THUS PEOPLE VIEW THE WORLD IN TERMS OF THESE PERCEPTUAL GRIDS AT INITIAL RESPONSE TO STIMULI THIS MEANS THAT THINGS ONLY TEND TO REGISTER IN CERTAIN WAYS THEY REACH THE PERSON THROUGH THE GRID AND ARE AUTOMATICALLY SHAPED BY IT ON THE LEVEL OF DECISION MAKING ANALYSIS OF INCOMING DATA WE MIGHT SAY THERE IS A STRONG PSYCHOLOGICAL NEED TO MAINTAIN AND STRENGTHEN THE GRID AS IT IS THE WARD AGAINST CHAOS THE MEANS BY WHICH ONE KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE STATUS AND POSITION WITHIN A GROUP STRUCTURE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED IN TERMS THAT CONFIRM OR SUSTAIN THAT GRID THAT REINFORCE THE ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH IT RELIES WILL BE MADE PROMINENT AND WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND THIS WILL IN TURN REINFORCE THE SUPPOSED VALIDITY OF THE GRID CONVERSELY ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE SEEN TO CONFLICT WITH THE GRID AND CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT INFORM THE WORLD-VIEW IN QUESTION IS EITHER TWISTED CONTEXTUALIZE OR INTERPRETED IN A MANNER THAT ACTUALLY REINFORCES THAT GRID OR AT LEAST FITS COMFORTABLY ENOUGH WITHIN IT OR ELSE IT IS DOWNPLAYED IF NOT DISCARDED ENTIRELY ON OCCASION IT IS VIOLENTLY REJECTED ONCE A BELIEF SYSTEM IS IN PLACE THEN REALITY CAN BE UNDERSTOOD ONLY IN TERMS OF THAT FILTER SO LONG AS THE FILTER REMAINS IN PLACE INDEED THE GRID IS SUPPOSED TO IN FACT BE REALITY THE ASSUMPTIONS WILL ALWAYS LOOK REASONABLE FOR THEY ARE SEEN TO OBVIOUSLY MATCH UP WITH REALITY IF YOU PLACE A BLUE FILM OVER YOUR EYES THE WORLD APPEARS BLUE

OFTEN CONFLICTING INPUT THAT MIGHT THREATEN ONE'S EMOTIONAL SECURITY IS SIMPLY NOT REGISTERED AT ALL

MOST HUMANS ARE TRIBALIST THEY NATURALLY LOCATE THEMSELVES WITHIN SMALLISH GROUP STRUCTURES THEIR MOTIVES BEING ALMOST PARADOXICAL ON THE ONE HAND THEY SEEK SECURITY THROUGH CONFORMITY THROUGH KNOWING THEY ARE ONE WITH THE GROUP AND THEY MODIFY THEIR BEHAVIOUR AND THINKING TO MATCH THOSE AROUND THEM PARADOXICALLY THEY DESIRE INDIVIDUAL STATUS AND THUS JOSTLE FOR POSITION AND RECOGNITION THIS IS THE BASIS OF ALL TRIBAL POLITICS

TRIBALIST ARE DEPENDENT ON THEIR GRIDS THEY TEND NOT TO APPRECIATE ANYTHING THAT DISAGREES WITH THEIR NOTION THAT THE WORLD IS BLUE SO TO SPEAK SOMETIMES THEY ATTACK IT OFTEN THEY JUST DISCARD IT AS NOT WORTH CAUSING CONFLICT OVER MOST PEOPLE PREFER ALLIES TO FOES ALTHOUGH WE MUST KEEP IN MIND THAT SOCIETAL AGGRESSION JOSTLING POSTURING SIGNALLING IS INHERENT TO THE TRIBALIST AND NORMAL TO THEIR SOCIAL INTERACTION HOWEVER IF THE INPUT OPENLY THREATENS THE INTEGRITY OF THE IDEOLOGICAL GRID AND THUS ON THE LEVEL OF BASIC MOTIVE THE SECURITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION THAT INPUT IS TREATED AS ILLEGITIMATE AS OFTEN IS THE ONE BRINGING THIS ALTERNATIVE FORWARD TRIBALIST DO NOT MOURN THE REFUSE THAT THEY DISCARD IF IT COULDN'T INCORPORATE AND THEREBY SERVE THE SYSTEM IN SOME FORM THEN GOOD RIDDANCE TO IT INPUT MUST REINFORCE THE WORLD-VIEW THAT SERVES TO PROVIDE THE DESIRED SECURITY STATUS AND PROMISE OF NEEDS MET THAT GROUP MEMBERSHIP BRINGS TO THE SOCIAL ANIMAL AND PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR SIGNALLING AND POSTURING TOO WHICH IS WHERE THEIR DESIRES AND IMPULSES TURN WHEN SURVIVAL IS NO LONGER AN IMMEDIATELY PRESSING CONCERN CLASSIC TRIBAL BEHAVIOUR THEY FIGHT AND SQUABBLE FOR STATUS BUT COMES THE OUTSIDER AND THEY RE BACK-TO-BACK CHALLENGES ARE ONLY TOLERATED IF THEY DON'T CHALLENGE AT ALL WHICH IS WHY I'D CLAIM THAT THE BULK OF ANY SOCIETY IS CONSERVATIVE AND REACTIONARY AND THOSE WHO PROCLAIM THEMSELVES AGENTS OF CHANGE USUALLY ARE NOT INSTEAD THEY REINFORCE THE SYSTEM WITH A FEW PROPOSED TWEAKS IN PLACE UNWILLING TO TRULY THREATEN THE VERY STRUCTURE THAT THEY MANIPULATE AND RIDE INTO POSITIONS THAT BENEFIT THEM YOU STIR THE POT CERTAINLY POLITICAL MANOEUVRING IN LARGE PART DEPENDS ON THIS AS THE CURRENT ORDER MUST BE SHAKEN UP SOMEWHAT TO ALLOW MOVEMENT AND THE ORDER REFORMS SLIGHTLY ALTERED IN THE AFTERMATH BUT YOU DON'T BREAK THE POT OR SCOOP ALL THE BROTH INTO A NEW POT

WHAT THIS REDUCES TO THEN IS THAT PEOPLE OFTEN BELIEVE THEY'RE DOING THINGS FOR ONE REASON OFTEN QUITE SINCERELY WHEN REALLY THEY'RE DRIVEN BY OTHER MOTIVES ENTIRELY WHEN CERTAIN BEHAVIOURS OR ATTITUDES DO NOT MEASURE UP TO THE STATED DEFINITION OF WHAT ONE IS AND DOES THAT IS BECAUSE THE STATED DEFINITION IS MERE NOISE SIGNALLING AND A KNOWS THAT SUCH IS NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY

ONE S OWN SOCIETAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS DEPENDENT ON CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS AND RECEIVED TRUTHS BEING IN ASCENDANCE AND CERTAIN LEFT UNQUESTIONED LEADING A WORLD-VIEW TO PRIVILEGE CERTAIN CONCEPTUAL PATHS WHILE LEAVING OTHERS UNTAKEN NO MATTER THE BENEFIT OR EVEN NECESSITY OF DOING SO SOCIETY MUST BE DEFINED ALONG CERTAIN LINES THAT AVOID THE PITFALLS OF AWARENESS OR DISSENT THAT MIGHT THREATEN AND CHALLENGE THE TRIBAL STRUCTURE AND THUS THE SECURITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOUND AMONG IT

MOST PEOPLE AFFILIATE WITH STRUCTURED GROUPS RELIGIOUS POLITICAL IDEOLOGICAL OFTEN THEY'LL EVEN EQUATE THE GROUP WITH THEIR PERSONAL IDENTITY IT'S NOT MY THEISTIC BELIEFS ARE CHRISTIAN IT'S I'M A CHRISTIAN THESE GROUPS ARE OF MANY SIZES BUT POLITICS WILL ALWAYS REDUCE THEM DOWN TO THE INSTINCTIVELY CORRECT SIZE WHEN NOT UNITED AGAINST A SHARED OUTSIDER AND AN ALLIANCE IS FLUID BY DEFINITION ONE DOES NOT CREATE PEACE THROUGH UNITY AGAINST A COMMON FOE THE TRIBAL SYSTEM HAS LONG INCORPORATED ALLOWANCE OF TEMPORARY COOPERATION WITHOUT THE NEED TO CREATE ENDURING TIES THE RESULT OF COURSE IS LAYERED SHELLS OF AFFILIATED IDENTITY WITH THE SELF RIGHT AT THE MIDDLE

THE AVERAGE PERSON BEING TRIBALIST IS ETERNALLY AWARE OF OTHER PEOPLE THEY ARE LOCKED INTO A FRAMEWORK OF POWER POLITICS WHO IS THIS PERSON WHERE DO I KNOW THEM FROM WHERE DO THEY STAND IN RELATION TO ME WHAT DO WE OWE EACH OTHER RIVAL ASSET THREAT CONTINUALLY SEEKING BOTH TO CONFORM TO WHAT THE PRIMATES BEHIND AND TO EITHER SIDE OF THEM ARE THINKING OR DOING IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED AND TO ASSERT THEIR INDIVIDUAL STATUS AND SO STAND OUT THIS OFTEN MEANS ATTACKING THE ACCEPTABLE TARGETS THOSE FURTHER TO THE FRINGES OF THE ALL-IMPORTANT GROUP THOSE THAT ARE DIFFERENT ARE TREATED WITH VAGUE HOSTILITY IN THE CASE OF THOSE THAT ARE DIFFERENT AND THREATENING IT'S NO LONGER VAGUE

EMPATHY IS A POOR TRAIT TO ENDOW WITH ETHICAL SIGNIFICANCE COMPASSION I WOULD ARGUE IS FAR SUPERIOR COMPASSION TRANSCENDS THE LIMITATIONS OF THE TRIBAL MODEL WHEREAS EMPATHY BY ITS VERY NATURE IS DEPENDENT UPON AN ABILITY TO DEFINE THE OTHER AND ONESELF WITHIN THE SAME PARAMETERS AND THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS DROPS OFF SHARPLY WHEN A TRIBALIST CONFRONTS AN OUTSIDER ONE WHO DOES NOT ENDORSE OR STRENGTHEN THE NARRATIVES UNDERPINNING THEIR SENSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY

CONSIDER RULES MOST PEOPLE BEND AND STRETCH THE RULES FOR THEIR OWN GAIN WHILE LOUDLY DECRYING ANY VIOLATION FROM OTHERS THUS THE NATURE OF RULES IS TO CHAIN THE COMPETITION AND TO PROVIDE A MEANS BY WHICH COMMUNITY AGGRESSION CAN BE BOUGHT TO BEAR AGAINST THOSE WHO THREATEN ONE'S SECURITY AND PROSPERITY OR THAT OF ONE'S IN-GROUP RULES ARE CONSIDERED PARAMOUNT IN SPITE OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S OWN SENSE THAT THEY ARE RIGHTLY AN EXCEPTION BECAUSE THE ABSENCE OF A FRAMEWORK OF RULES AND IMPLIED COMMUNAL PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR VIOLATION IS EQUATED WITH CHAOS ITSELF EQUATED WITH INSECURITY AND THUS VULNERABILITY THE TRIBALIST VIEWS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OR IMPLIED VALIDATION OF A POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE AS SHARED ALLEGIANCE WHEREAS THEY SHOULD MORE USEFULLY IN MY OPINION HOLD NO ALLEGIANCE AND BE INTERESTED IN THE OVERALL SHAPE OF THE SYSTEM AND ITS FUNCTIONALITY

WHAT IS THE FIRST RULE OF TRIBALIST IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN WE DO IT

WITHOUT THE DESIRE TO FIT IN AS I HAVE QUALIFIED IT HERE WITHOUT TRIBAL POLITICS THERE IS NO INHERENT SENSE OF BEING PART OF A STRUCTURED GROUP THERE IS CERTAINLY A SENSE OF COMMUNITY OF THE EMOTIONAL SENSE OF CONNECTION AND THERE IS THE LEGAL AND MORAL FRAMEWORK THAT IS ESTABLISHED NEGOTIATED AND HAPPILY SUBMITTED TO BUT THERE IS NO SENSE OF INHERENT ALLEGIANCE INDEED GROUPS ARE THE BAD GUYS FOR THEY WARP THE COMMUNITY LIKE GRAVITY WELLS IN THE FABRIC OF SPACE TIME CAUGHT BETWEEN THE RULES AND TRIBAL THE TRIBALIST GOES WITH THE LATTER SEEING RULES AS A FRAMEWORK TO CATCH OUT OTHERS AND LIMIT THE COMPETITION RULES ARE FOR THE RIVAL NOT FOR YOU THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH CONSISTS OF INDIVIDUALS WILL NOT BE MET WHEN TRIBAL GROUP IDENTIFICATION AND AFFILIATION AND THE VARIOUS SOCIAL STRUCTURES THAT ARE INHERENT THERE OCCUR


MAYBE IT'S THAT WE DON'T RESPECT OURSELVES ENOUGH BUT I THINK MAYBE IT IS THAT WE DON'T RESPECT OUR INDIVIDUAL ABILITY AND OBLIGATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY EVEN IF YOU RESPECT YOURSELF IF YOU FEAR OR BELIEVE YOUR VALUES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR TAKEN SERIOUSLY THEN IT IS EASY TO MUTE YOUR VOICE AND INACTION GROUPTHINK BECOMES THE EASY ALTERNATIVE YES RESPECT YOURSELF BUT MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY RESPECT YOUR INDIVIDUAL PURPOSE FOR BEING A PART OF COMMUNITY IT'S SIMPLER TO DO WRONG WHEN IT DOESN'T SEE CONSEQUENTIAL IN A MEANINGFUL WAY
I GET THE POINT AND VERY MUCH AGREE WITH MOST OF IT BUT USING THE WORD ROOT DOES NOT SIT RIGHT PERPETUATING FORCE PERHAPS BUT NOT ROOT I BELIEVE THE ROOT IS VIOLENT TRIBAL MAMMALIAN EVOLUTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH EGO AND SEEING ONES BODY MIND AS SEPARATE INSTEAD OF FEELING AND PERCEIVING ALL OF US AS ONE
FIND ON THIS PAGE SARTRE HITS WOW UH NOBODY KIND OF RELEVANT OH WELL YA CRAZY KIDS
BUT KANT ALSO SAYS THAT YOU SHOULDN T TREAT YOURSELF AS A MERE MEANS

THIS
I'M SO GLAD I READ THIS I THINK I'VE LIVED IN SERVILITY FOR MOST OF MY LIFE I FEEL ENLIGHTENED PUTTING A WORD TO IT AND KNOWING THAT I DON'T HAVE TO APPEASE ANYONE AND THAT IN FACT I'M MORE HONEST AND LIBERATED IF I DON'T
WITH THIS RING ON YOUR FINGER YOU CAN SEIZE THE PRESIDENCY ROB FORT KNOX AND INSTANTLY BECOME THE MOST FAMOUS PERSON ON THE PLANET SO WOULD YOU DO IT

YES PROBABLY WOULD KILL SOME PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT ME THE WRONG WAY TOO ON MY WAY TO KILL A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE RUBBED ME THE WRONG WAY JUST BECAUSE I COULD DO SO

ALTHOUGH MOST ASSUME THAT AN IMMORAL PERSON IS ONE WHO S READY TO DEFY LAW AND CONVENTION TO GET WHAT THEY WANT I THINK THE INVERSE IS OFTEN TRUE IMMORALITY IS FREQUENTLY MOTIVATED BY A READINESS TO CONFORM TO LAW AND CONVENTION IN OPPOSITION TO OUR OWN VALUES IN THESE CASES IT S NOT THAT WE CARE TOO LITTLE ABOUT OTHERS IT S THAT WE CARE TOO MUCH

I AGREE THE INVERSE IS OFTEN TRUE BUT I ARGUE THE INVERSE IS STILL FAR LESS COMMON MUCH MORE EVIL ACTION STEMS FROM THINGS LIKE DESIRE FOR SELF-GAIN WITH A LACK OF CONCERN OR EMPATHY FOR THOSE ONE WOULD EFFECT AND FROM PEOPLES SENSE OF PRIDE AND EGOS THAN FROM JOINING IN LAUGHING AT A COWORKER WHO IS BEING PICKED ON WHICH I ALSO CONSIDER TO BE IN THE LIGHT GRAY AREA NOT NICE NOT EXACTLY THE BLACK AREA OF EVIL ON A MORAL SPECTRUM

DOING THE WRONG THING IS FOR MOST OF US PRETTY MUNDANE IT S NOT USURPING POLITICAL POWER OR STEALING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

WHAT IF DOING THE WRONG THING IS RUELY ROUTINE AND SOMEWHAT MUNDANE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AS IN THE CASE OF SHOPLIFTERS I WOULD SAY SHOPLIFTING IS A DARKER GRAY ON THE MORAL SPECTRUM OF EVIL WORSE THAN LAUGHING AT A RACIST JOKE TO AVOID CAUSING PROBLEMS

I DON'T AGREE THAT SCENARIOS WHERE YOU ARE NOT COMPLETELY HONEST AND VOCAL ABOUT YOUR OPINIONS IS EVIL AT ALL ALTHOUGH THE DESIRE TO FIT IN IS RELEVANT TO THAT I THINK THE ROOT OF MOST WRONG DOING TENDS TO BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID MOST PEOPLE THINK OF DEFYING LAWS AND CONVENTIONS LIKE THE IDEA YOU SHOULD BE NICE AND NOT STAB PEOPLE YOU JUST DON'T LIKE FOR SELF GAIN
SO BASICALLY WE WILL NEVER HAVE PEACE
TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T CHECKED IT OUT AEON IS PRETTY GREAT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EVIL I WOULDN'T SAY THAT YES IT IS A HUMAN INSTINCT THAT CAN EASILY BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BUT IT IS NOT THE CENTER OF ALL EVIL THE DESIRE TO FIT IN CAN BE USED FOR BOTH GOOD AND EVIL I THINK THE ARTICLE WAS A BIT IN THIS WAY
WHAT IS WRONG CAN BE CULTURALLY FORCED ITSELF
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST EVIL

ALSO WRONGDOINGS CAN PREVENT YOU FROM FITTING IN IF I START CALLING EVERYONE HERE A MOTHERFUCKER I'LL DEFINITELY WON'T FIT IN
THE DESIRE TO FIT IN IS THE ROOT OF ALMOST ALL WRONGDOING

NOTHING BUT THE AUTHOR'S OPINION
AND THE ROOT OF ALMOST ALL RIGHTDOING

IT IS CALLED THE WILL TO POWER AND THAT'S JUST HOW THINGS ARE
LOW EFFORT BLOG POSTS LIKE THIS SHOULD NOT GET SO MUCH ATTENTION THE CLAIM IS FALSE AND INEQUALITY AND THE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS AREN'T EXPLAINED BY FITTING IN VERY WELL AND THEY ARE TWO OF THE LARGEST INSTANCES OF WRONGDOING IN HISTORY
I DO NOT DISAGREE WITH THE DANGERS OF THE DESIRE TO FIT IN AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF IT HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO STRESS THAT A LOT OF HARM COULD BE DONE BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEEK GROUP CONSENSUS PEOPLE WHO SEEK NOT TO CONFORM MAY BE A COMPLETE NUISANCE TO DEAL WITH AND AT THE WORST END DESTRUCTIVE BOTH TO HIMSELF AND THE GROUP
THE BIBLE DISAGREES

PASSAGE SEARCH TIMOTHY VERSION KV
EXPLAINS MY DOING THE RIGHT THING EVERY TIME I WILL DIE BEFORE I AM SEEN AS ONE OF YOU AND I DON'T JUST MEAN MILLENNIAL
SO THEN TRUE NEUTRAL GOD IS STILL ON THE TABLE
FIRST OFF SUCH BEAUTIFUL SMART AND FUNNY ANIMATION I WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSED

I ENJOYED THIS AS A DISCUSSION ON HOW NEITHER THE PROBLEM OF EVIL FOR A GOOD GOD AND OF GOOD FOR AN EVIL GOD ARE KNOCK-DOWN ARGUMENTS BEEN STRONGER IF HE HADN'T MADE THE LEAP TO THEISTIC ONTOLOGY ON THE PREMISE IF WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE THERE'S NOT AN EVIL GOD AND THAT THE PROBABILITY OF THERE BEING AN EVIL VS A GOOD GOD ARE THE SAME THEN WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE THERE'S NOT A GOOD GOD

I DON'T THINK HE'S REASONABLY EVEN BEGUN TO ESTABLISH THE PREMISE THAT SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS OF EVIL SHOW THAT EVIL GOOD GOD EXISTENCE PROBABILITIES ARE SIMILAR NOR THE PREMISE THAT WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE THAT AN EVIL GOD DOESN'T EXIST IF HIS ARGUMENT IS DIRECTED ONLY AT PEOPLE WHO ALREADY ACCEPT THIS LATTER PREMISE THEN HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVE IT BUT IT MAKES THE ARGUMENT QUITE NARROWLY SCOPED

THERE'S SOME WEIRD BURDEN OF PROOF THING GOING ON HERE I CAN'T QUITE PUT MY FINGER ON HE'S SAYING

THE PROBLEM OF EVIL DOESN'T KNOCK DOWN GOOD OR BAD GODS

2 THEREFORE WE CAN'T ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF THERE BEING GOOD OR BAD GODS

THERE ARE NOT BAD GODS

THEREFORE NEITHER EXIST
THIS ARGUMENT IS BULLSHIT HE ASSUMES EVIL GOD CAN'T EXIST BECAUSE PEOPLE DISLIKE THE CONCEPT NOT BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

BUT IN BROADER TERMS THIS HAS NEVER SAT WELL AS A DEBUNK WITH ME IT ASSUMES A SHARED PSYCHOLOGY OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED GOOD BY GOD WHICH IS AN ASSUMPTION
I'M STUCK ON WHY EVIL GOD ALLOWED FREE WILLIAM
LET'S SAY A GOD EXISTS THERE IS NO REASON TO SUGGEST THAT HE MUST BE EITHER GOOD OR EVIL WOULD YOU SAY YOU'RE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR IS PURE GOOD OR PURE EVIL WHY GOD MUST BE DEFINED GOOD OR EVIL AREN'T WE ALL WORKING TOWARDS WHAT WE BELIEVE TO GOOD

TAKE THE MONISTIC CONCEPT OF SATAN THE DEVIL THE DEVIL IS CONSIDERED EVIL BUT WHY WHAT ARE HIS MOTIVATIONS ARGUABLY HE LOVES GOD SO MUCH SO THAT HE BELIEVES THAT MAN WILL NEVER LOVE HIM AS HE SHOULD BE LOVED HE TEMPTS MAN INTO SINNING TO PROVE TO GOD HOW BAD MAN IS I WOULDN'T DEFINE HIS INTENTIONS AS GOOD OR EVIL TOWARDS GOD FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE CONSIDER IT AS EVIL EVIL AND GOOD IS COMPLETELY RELATIVE WHERE SUBJECTS ACTIONS MOTIVATIONS CANNOT BE OBJECTIVELY DISTINGUISHED IN TWO BINARY POLES

IN MANY JEWISH BELIEFS IT IS BELIEVED THAT UNLIKE THERE CHRISTIAN GOD THEIR GOD IS IN FACT FALLIBLE AND MANY OF THINGS WE BELIEVE TO BE GOOD OR EVIL CAN BE EXPLAINED BY HIS FALLIBILITY

IN THE KORAN GOD IS REFERRED TO AS GREAT MERCIFUL FORGIVING LOVING ETC BUT NEVER EXPLICITLY GOOD OR EVIL AVOIDING THE BINARY LOGIC OF GOOD OR EVIL
HE DOESN'T GIVE A REASON WHY GOOD OR EVIL GOD DO OR DO NOT EXIST HE ONLY SHOWS THAT GOD MIGHT BE EVIL BUT AT THE END HE SAYS WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE THERE'S NO GOOD OR EVIL GOD YET THAT CONCLUSION WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY HIS PREMISE SO HE IS NOT A GOOD PHILOSOPHER
I'M NOT SURE THIS IS A STRONG ARGUMENT

ISN'T THE NOTION OF AN EVIL GOD A NOTIONAL AND OR LINGUISTIC IMPOSSIBILITY
BECAUSE HISTORICALLY THE VERY NOTION OF GOOD IS TO BE IN MORAL ALIGNMENT WITH GOD AND OR GOD'S WILL AND THE VERY NOTION OF EVIL IS TO BE AGAINST GOD'S MORALITY OR WILLIAM ONLY IN OUR CURRENT SECULAR TIMES DO WE THINK OF OTHER MARKERS FOR GOOD SUCH AS UTILITARIANISM RECIPROCITY ETC

THE VERY NOTION OF AN EVIL GOD IS ABSURD AND A CONTRADICTION BECAUSE EVIL GOD PRESUPPOSES AN OBJECTIVE MORALITY EVIL BEYOND GOD WHICH CANNOT BE IF THERE IS INDEED A GOD

PUT DIFFERENTLY IF TORTURING CUTE KITTENS WERE PART OF GOD'S DIVINE PLAN THEN WE WOULD ALL SEE TORTURING KITTENS AS GOOD BECAUSE IT IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH GOD'S WILLIAM

OR ALTERNATELY LOVE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE EVIL BY SOME OVERARCHING STANDARD BUT WE WILL NEVER SEE THAT STANDARD IF THERE IS A GOD BECAUSE GOD PROMOTES LOVE

IF WE ACCEPT OR POSTULATE THAT THERE IS A GOD THEN ANY AND EVERY NOTION OF MORALITY MUST BE ALIGNED WITH THAT GOD
THE IDEA OF AN EVIL GOD ONLY WORKS IF YOU A PRIORI DON'T ACCEPT THE IDEA OF GOD
UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THIS VIDEO BEGAN TROUBLED ME THE WORLD HAS TOO MUCH SUFFERING FOR IT TO BE THE CREATION OF A GOOD GOD

WHY NOT HOW MUCH SUFFERING IS TOO MUCH WHO MAKES THAT QUALIFICATION ALSO CONSIDERING THE ABSOLUTE AND OBJECTIVE NATURE OF GOD'S EXISTENCE HOW CAN WE QUALIFY IT BASED ON SOMETHING AS SUBJECTIVE AS SUFFERING

IT SEEMS FAR TOO COMMON TO EQUATE THE TWO ON THE BASIS OF PERHAPS SEMANTICS WHEN SUCH AN IMPOSING QUESTION IS AT STAKE
I DON'T GET IT HOW DOES HE JUMP TO THE WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE THERE IS NO EVIL GOD

HOW CAN WE BE PRETTY SURE THERE IS NO EVIL GOD
I LOST MY SHIT WHEN THE PUPPET GUY SLAPPED THE LITTLE PUPPET GIRL
ISN'T THIS CONFUSING TWO DIFFERENT ARGUMENTS

GOD EXISTS

2 GOD IS OMNIPOTENT AND GOOD

I DON'T THINK ANYONE BELIEVES A GOOD GOD EXISTS SIMPLY BASED ON GOOD THINGS OR ACTIONS THAT ARE EVEN IF ANYONE DID BELIEVE THAT THE ARGUMENTS FOR OR AGAINST A GOOD EVIL OR GOD WOULD ONLY MATTER IF YOU DEAL WITH THE DOES GOD EXIST QUESTION THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD ARGUMENT IF YOU THINK A GOD THAT IS NOT GOOD EXISTS BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM RELEVANT TO WHETHER OR NOT A GOD EXISTS AT ALL
HEY GUYS I KNOW THE ILLUSTRATOR ANIMATOR WHO DID THIS GO SHOW SOME LOVE
LITERALLY A DEVIL'S ADVOCATE WELL DONE MY PROBLEM IS THAT A THOUGHT PROVOKING ARGUMENT HAS BEEN LAID OUT AS IF TO GET THE AUDIENCE TO QUESTION SPIRITUALITY THEN THE PERSONAL OPINION IS IGNOBLY BLURTED OUT IN THE LAST SECOND OF THE VIDEO
FIRST OF ALL CAN AN EVIL GOD EVEN EXIST PERHAPS BACK IN THE TIME OF THE CAPRICIOUS GODS OF THE ANCIENT PANTHEONS BUT ISN'T IN SOME RELIGIONS GOD LITERALLY THE SOURCE OF ALL MORALITY AND NOT IN THE SENSE THAT GOD ONLY WILLS WHAT IS GOOD BUT THAT WHATEVER HE WILLS IS GOOD BY DEFINITION PERHAPS IN A UNIVERSE WITH AN EVIL GOD WE'D THINK BURNING TODDLERS AND RACISM WERE VIRTUES WE WOULDN'T KNOW UNLESS THERE WAS A WAY TO KNOW GOOD AND EVIL WITHOUT GOD WHICH IS HARD TO DEFEND WHEN YOU'RE ALREADY ASSUMING GOD EXISTS

BUT EVEN IF WE ALLOW FOR A CONCEPT OF GOOD AND EVIL DISTINCT FROM GOD I STILL DON'T THINK EITHER GOD SEEMS JUST AS LIKELY I THINK MOST PEOPLE ALLOWING FOR JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF MORAL REALISM WOULD AGREE THAT AS A WHOLE HUMANITY HAS BECOME MORE GOOD AND WE'RE MORE CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH THE APATHETIC EVILS OF NATURE SURE THERE'S STILL A LOT OF EVIL AND SUFFERING IN THE WORLD BUT VIOLENCE AND WARS ARE AT AN ALL TIME LOW SLAVERY ALTHOUGH IT SADLY STILL EXISTS ISN'T AN INTEGRAL PART OF SOCIETY ANYMORE AND THE ODDS OF DYING FROM ANY KIND OF DISEASE HAS GONE WAY DOWN EVEN IF UTOPIA ISN'T QUITE IN REACH YET THIS ALL DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE PART OF A UNIVERSE CREATED BY AN EVIL GOD
THE CONCEPT OF ONE GOD IS RELATIVELY NEW ANYWAY BEFORE JUDAISM EVERYONE WAS PAGAN AND GODS WEREN'T NECESSARILY GOOD OR BAD YOU JUST PRAYED TO THEM ALL IN HOPES THAT THEY WOULD HELP YOU OUT

I LIKED THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS VIDEO THOUGH NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT OF A BAD GOD
INDIFFERENT GOD
IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME THAT AN EVIL GOD GIVING FREE WILL HAS THE SAME MOTIVATIONS OR EVEN HAS ONLY INVERSE MOTIVATIONS FOR THE SAME ACTIONS THAT A GOOD GOD HAS WHY WOULD A GOOD GOD GIVE FREE WILL FOR THE INVERSELY SAME REASONS THAT AN EVIL GOD WOULD HE'S TRYING TO MIRROR THE ARGUMENT IN ORDER TO REFUTE IT BUT DOESN'T THIS NARROW DOWN MORALITY TOO MUCH

AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF EVIL GODS BY MODERN WESTERN CHRISTIAN STANDARDS KALI HADES SHIVA VIRTUALLY ANY GOD THAT IS TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED PAGAN IS OFTEN AMORAL OR DOWN RIGHT EVIL TO NON WORSHIPPERS EVEN OLDER JEWISH BELIEFS SOMETIMES PORTRAY THEIR GOD AS BEING SOMEHOW ABOVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MORALITY

DID GOD CREATE CHOICE AND FREE WILL DID HE DO IT FOR THE REASONS STATED ABOVE WOULDN'T THIS MEAN THAT GOD ALSO NOT GIVEN FREE WILL IF GOD GIVING FREE WILL WAS AN ACT OF GOODNESS AND IF IT WAS THE ONLY OPTION OF A GOOD GOD AS IS THE REQUIRED JUDGEMENT FOR THIS REFUTATION TO WORK THEN IS IT NOT MORE PLAUSIBLE THAT THE EVIL GOD WOULD REFUSE TO CREATE FREE WILL WHICH IS ITSELF CONSIDERED A GOOD ACT

AN EVIL GOD IS JUST AS LIKELY TO TAKE AWAY FREE WILL AS HE IS TO GIVE IT BUT A GOOD GOD COULD NEVER BE GOOD WITHOUT FREE WILLIAM THEY CANNOT MIRROR EACH EACH OTHER THIS VIDEO IS A VERY NARROW REFUTATION OF A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF EXPLANATIONS ANY ONE OF WHICH CAN BE TWEAKED TO NULLIFY THE REFUTATION I DON'T THINK WHAT HE'S TRYING TO REFUTE IS A VERY STRONG ARGUMENT FOR GOD TO BEGIN WITH SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY I FIND HIS MIRRORED ARGUMENT SO PROBLEMATIC


HE IS USING GOOD AND BAD AS OBJECTIVE WORDS IF THEY ARE OBJECTIVE THEN THERE MUST BE AN ULTIMATE GOOD OR AN ULTIMATE BAD THAT WOULD BE YOUR GOD
EVIL GOD WORLD WOULD LOOK MUCH WORSE THAN THIS WORLD DOES JUST A FEW MINOR CHANGES AND YOU COULD HAVE A LOT MORE HARDSHIP FOR EVERYONE
THERE'S NO ARGUMENT FOR WHY WE'RE PRETTY SURE THE BAD GOD AND THE GOOD GOD DON'T EXIST
I REALLY DON'T THINK THESE TWO ARE EQUIVALENT WHY WOULD AN EVIL GOD WANT TO FREE US WHO CARES IF YOU'RE PURE EVIL YOU DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS ABOUT SHIT LIKE RESPONSIBILITY OR AUTHENTICITY

ALSO RE THE VIDEO ITSELF LAO DUDE IS UGLY FOR A CARTOON
CREATURES ARE NOT BORN WITH DESIRES UNLESS SATISFACTION FOR THESE DESIRES EXISTS A BABY FEELS HUNGER WELL THERE IS SUCH A THING AS FOOD A DUCKLING WANTS TO SWIM WELL THERE IS SUCH A THING AS WATER MEN FEEL SEXUAL DESIRE WELL THERE IS SUCH A THING AS SEX IF I FIND IN MYSELF A DESIRE WHICH NO EXPERIENCE IN THIS WORLD CAN SATISFY THE MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION IS THAT I WAS MADE FOR ANOTHER WORLD

COUNTY SOUTH LEWIS
A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM IS THAT FREE WILL DOESN'T EXIST WHICH UNDERMINES THE IDEA OF GOD CUTTING THE STRINGS ON US ARGUING THAT IS TRICKY THOUGH I PERSONALLY THINK THE WRITING IS ON THE WALL THAT FREE WILL IS NONSENSE BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE STRUGGLE JUST TO HONESTLY ENTERTAIN THE THOUGHT
GREAT FOR MOST OF IT CLEAR IDEAS FUNNY ANIMATIONS LOVELY ACCENT AND THEN HE SAYS

WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE THERE IS NO EVIL GOD

AND IT ALL GOES TO HELL HE DOESN'T JUSTIFY THIS CLAIM IN THE SLIGHTEST THE BEST HE DOES IS TO SUGGEST THAT NO ONE BELIEVES IN SUCH AN EVIL GOD BUT THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE THAT EVIL GOD DOESN'T EXIST THERE WAS A TIME WHEN NO ONE BELIEVED THERE WERE BLACK SWANS OR WHEN NO ONE BELIEVED THAT THE SUN WAS AT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE

ALL THAT THE TO DO TO BE COHERENT IS NOT DENY THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EVIL GOD ON THE GROUNDS THAT THERE IS GOOD IN THE WORLD BUT IT'S FAIR GAME FOR US TO POINT OUT OTHER REASONS TO FAVOR THE GOOD GOD HYPOTHESIS OVER THE EVIL GOD ONE
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK OF THIS NOT SAYING IT IS RIGHT BUT JUST MY IDEAS I'D LOVE TO GET FEEDBACK AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK ALSO I POSTED THIS BELOW AS WELL

AGREED IT'S NOT A STRONG ARGUMENT AND I FEEL LIKE IT ALWAYS COME BACK TO THE BASE IDEA THAT IF THERE WERE A GOD HE SHE IT SHOULD BE GOOD AND HOW CAN A GOOD GOD LET BAD THINGS HAPPEN

I'D LOVE TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE FOLLOWING
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE ARGUMENT THAT GOD MADE EVIL AS FROM MY RELIGIOUS UPBRINGING IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN EXPLAINED AS SUCH

GOD IS GOOD HE DOES NOTHING THAT HARMS PEOPLE
2 WE ALL CHOOSE TO COME AND TO EXIST AND THEREFORE KNEW WHAT WE WERE GETTING INTO
GOD IS FOR THE MOST PART REALLY REALLY HANDS OFFICIAL
THE NATURAL WORLD LAW OF THE UNIVERSE ARE THAT UNIVERSAL NOT SO MUCH CREATED BY GOD AS JUST ETERNAL LAWS THAT CANNOT BE CHANGED
GOD SETS EVERYTHING IN MOTION AND LET'S THE SYSTEM RUN
GOD GIVES ALL LIVING THINGS FREE WILL TO ACT ON THEIR OWN AND HE WILL NOT INTERVENE

THEREFORE BAD THINGS HAPPENING DO NOT EQUATE NO GOD AS GOD IS MORE OF A WATCHER THEN A DOER HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO HELP A GROUP OUT FOR HIS BIG PLAN BUT OTHER TIMES MILLIONS CAN DIE IT'S FINE THAT'S JUST HOW THE SYSTEM RUNS BASICALLY THAT'S LIFE LIFE IS MADE TO BE NOT GREAT AS A WAY TO TEACH AND LET PEOPLE LEARN YEAH YOU MIGHT DIE BUT YOU WERE ALIVE BEFORE BIRTH AND WILL CONTINUE AFTER SO IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL IN THE ETERNAL SENSE

ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING IT IS THAT GOD DIDN'T MAKE HITLER OR DISEASES OR RAPE AND MURDER NATURE MAKES THEM AS THE SYSTEM RUNS OR WE CHOOSE HOW TO ACT WANT TO MURDER SOMEONE GO AHEAD YOU'VE GOT FREE WILL TO DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT AND NATURE DOES NATURE IT CHANGES AND CREATES AS THE SYSTEM RUNS
THE WAY I SEE IT A TRUE OMNIPOTENT GOD DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY A PRICE FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE TRUE OMNIPOTENCE DOES WHAT IT WANTS WITHOUT PAYING A PRICE THE FACT THIS OMNIPOTENT BEING CANNOT CONSISTENTLY CREATE NATURALLY GOOD HUMANS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO SAY IT IS NOT OMNIPOTENT IF IT IS NOT OMNIPOTENT THEN IT IS NOT A GOD
HIS FIRST MISTAKE IS THAT HE AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMES ALL RELIGIONS BELIEVE IN A GOOD GOD S WHEN SUCH IS NOT THE CASE SEE GREEK MYTHOLOGY HE IMMEDIATELY LUMPS POLYTHEISM WITH MONOTHEISM SPECIFICALLY CHRISTIANITY AND JUDAISM AND ALSO ISLAM AND ASSUMES THAT ALL OTHER RELIGIONS FOLLOW THE IDEALS OF CHRISTIANITY OR JUDAISM ON WHY EVIL EXISTS I UNDERSTAND THAT I AM BIASED BUT YOU CAN'T LUMP ALL RELIGIONS TOGETHER AND ONLY ATTACK CHRISTIANITY LIKE TRYING TO SAY WHY A GROUP OF PEOPLE SHOULD BE IMPRISONED AND ONLY ADDRESSING ABD ACCUSING ONE OF THE CROWD
THE PROBLEM OF EVIL CAN BE REFUTED IN JUST SUCH A MANNER AS FIRST PROPOSED AND LET'S SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT THE SAME REFUTATION WORKS FOR A PROBLEM OF GOOD WHICH CLAIMS THAT AN EVIL GOD CANNOT EXIST BECAUSE THERE IS GOOD

OK SO IT'S JUST AS LIKELY THAT BOTH OF THESE GODS EXIST WHY DOES NO ONE BELIEVE IN AN EVIL GOD EVEN THOUGH LAW CAN EXPLAIN WHY HIS EVIL GOD ALLOWS GOOD IN THE SAME WAY THAT A THEIST WOULD EXPLAIN WHY A GOOD GOD ALLOWS EVIL HE IS NEGLECTING OTHER EVIDENCE FOR A GOOD GOD'S EXISTENCE STREET THOMAS AQUINAS FIVE WAYS COME FIRST TO MIND THERE IS NO ANALOGOUS ARGUMENT FOR ANY OF THE FIVE WAYS THAT WOULD PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF AN EVIL GOD AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE FIVE WAYS THEMSELVES ARE PROVING THE EXISTENCE OF A GOOD GOD

WE HAVE GOOD REASON VIA AQUINAS FIVE WAYS TO BELIEVE IN A GOOD GOD WHICH MAY ALLOW EVIL WE HAVE NO SUCH REASON TO BELIEVE IN AN EVIL GOD WHICH MAY ALLOW GOOD
I'D SAY THAT SOME BRANCHES OF CHRISTIANITY BELIEVE THAT GOOD THINGS ARE GOOD BY VIRTUE OF GOD DECLARING THEM GOOD OBVIOUSLY MOST OF THEM WILL ALSO ARGUE THAT GOD'S COMMANDMENTS WILL FOR THE MOST PART ALSO BE BEST FOR HUMANITY BUT THEY SAY THAT EVEN IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE MORAL REASONING BEHIND SOMETHING ASSUME IT IS GOOD IF IT COMES FROM GOD IN SOME BRANCHES OF CHRISTIANITY THAT CAN EVEN BE EXTENDED TO THINGS OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS EVIL BY MOST PEOPLE SUCH AS CERTAIN FORMS OF SUFFERING IN THE WORLD I AM MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT SOTERIOLOGICAL CALVINISM HERE BECAUSE MOST CALVINISTS DON'T SAY THAT FREE WILL IS THE EXPLANATION FOR EVIL IN THE WORLD

MOST WILL SAY THAT ANY EVIL IN THE WORLD IS SIMPLY FOR A GREATER GOOD IN THE END AND IT IS ALL PART OF GOD'S PLAN SOME EVIL IS USED IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS LIKE HOW GOD USED THE SINS OF BROTHERS IN GENESIS TO SAVE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE WORLD FROM STARVATION AND SOMETIMES EVIL IS DONE FOR SOMETHING WHICH WILL NOT WORK ITSELF OUT UNTIL THE END OF TIME NOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS A COHERENT POSITION I'LL LEAVE TO YOU BUT FREE WILL IS NOT THE UNIVERSAL EXPLANATION FOR THEISM

OF COURSE YOU COULD ALSO ARGUE FOR AN EVIL CALVINISTIC GOD ONE WHO ALLOWS GOOD IN THE WORLD BECAUSE IT EVENTUALLY CAUSES MORE SUFFERING WHEN PEOPLE FINALLY SUFFER AND DIE A LOT MORE PEOPLE DIE UNHAPPY THAN HAPPY IN FACT THAT IS PROBABLY A MORE CONVINCING ARGUMENT THAN FOR A GOOD CALVINISTIC GOD
I ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN A EVIL GOD I'M A PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHER AND I BELIEVE IN THE GODHEAD AND THAT IT CAN BE EXPERIENCED BY HUMANS I THINK GOD IS GENERALLY GOOD IN THAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE FOR THE BEST HE THINKS A MORE RIGHTEOUS CREATION IS ONE WHERE HUMAN BEINGS ARE FREE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO GOOD YOU ARE SUPERIOR TO SOMEONE WHO IS FORCED INTO DOING GOOD I THINK THAT ALLOWING OR CREATING EVIL THEN MAKES GOD AN EVIL BEING WHICH HE RECTIFIES BY SACRIFICING HIS SON BASICALLY PURIFYING HIS WILLIAM SO I THINK MY GOD IS NOT BENEVOLENT AT THE MOMENT WE WOULD BE LIVING IN HEAVEN BUT IS NOT NECESSARILY MALEVOLENT EITHER INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO CAUSE HARM
DID SOMEONE ALREADY ASK ABOUT NEUTRAL GOD IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
I WONDER IF THOSE TWO SITUATIONS ARE EQUIVALENT BOTH EVIL AND GOOD GOD CUT OUR STRINGS SO THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS HOWEVER I WOULD CONTEND THAT HUMANITY GENERALLY VALUES THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE MORALLY GOOD OVER THOSE WHICH ARE MORALLY EVIL LEFT TO OUR OWN DEVICES MOST OF US WILL TRY TO MAXIMIZE GOOD ACTIONS AND OR MINIMIZE EVIL ONES IT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL FOR AN EVIL GOD TO CUT OUR STRINGS SINCE MOST OF US WOULD TRY TO MAXIMIZE GOOD SO IT WOULD APPEAR THAT GOOD AND EVIL GODS ACTIONS CANNOT BE MIRROR IMAGES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF MAXIMIZING GOOD OR EVIL RESPECTIVELY FOR THAT TO HAPPEN HUMAN BEINGS WOULD NEED TO VALUE GOOD AND EVIL ACTIONS EQUALLY ANY COMMENTS
WHY WOULD EVIL GOD GIVE PEOPLE FREE WILL THE WHOLE POINT OF THE GOOD GOD FREE WILL ARGUMENT IS THAT A GOOD GOD GIVES FREE WILL BECAUSE FREE WILL IS THE BEST THING HE CAN GIVE YOU BUT HAVING FREE WILL MEANS PEOPLE CAN DO BAD THINGS THE FREE WILL EXPLANATION FOR A GOOD GOD DOES NOT TRANSLATE EXACTLY TO JUST A WAY TO EXPLAIN A GOOD GOD THAT CAN ALSO BE APPLIED FOR AN EVIL GOD AN EVIL GOD WOULD NOT GIVE PEOPLE FREE WILLIAM
REMOVED
GUYS IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER NEW DIMENSIONS OF RELIGIOUS COMPLEXITY JUST READ THE ANURAG SAGAR IT CONTAINS A QUIET NICE CREATION MYTH EXPLAINING THE GOOD EVIL DILEMMA LEARN AND HAVE FUN
I SUPPOSE THE EXISTENCE OF AN INDIFFERENT GOD IS NOT ABOVE IMAGINATION
WHY WOULD AN EVIL GOD CUT THE STRINGS ISN'T INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM ULTIMATELY A GOOD THING AND THEREBY SOMETHING AN EVIL GOD WOULD NOT ALLOW

THOSE WHO PROPOSE A GOOD GOD SAY THAT HE WOULD RATHER BE SERVED BY THOSE WHO DO SO WILLINGLY EVEN THOUGH SOME MAY NOT CHOOSE TO DO SO

CONVERSELY WOULDN'T AN EVIL GOD WANT TO BE SERVED NO MATTER WHAT AND WOULDN'T CARE IF IT WERE BY CHOICE OR BY FORCE
THE AGNOSTICS BASICALLY BELIEVED IN AN EVIL DEMIURGE I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE THE IDEA IS SO FOREIGN EVEN TO ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS WHEN YOU LOOK AT GREEK AND ROMAN GODS THEY'RE JUST COMPLETE ASSHOLES
NOT NECESSARILY ALL YOU NEED IS A GOD OR GOD WHO IS AN UNMOVED OR PRIMARY AGENT THE CAUSE OF THE UNIVERSE THE ATTRIBUTES CAN BE ARGUED BUT ARE MORE OR LESS MEANINGLESS BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF ARGUMENTS THAT DON'T DEAL WITH THE GOD BUT RATHER THE PROBABILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF A PRIME MOVER BASED ON THE RULES AND LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE AROUND US
INTERESTING ARGUMENT I'M STILL TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND IT THOUGH AND AN NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT IT IS TRYING TO SHOW IT SEEMS TO DEPEND VERY STRONGLY ON A POINT MADE TOWARD THE BEGINNING THAT EVIL IN THE WORLD IS ITSELF STRONG EVIDENCE FOR THE NONEXISTENCE OF A GOOD GOD IT THEN GOES ON TO SHOW THAT FREE WILL IS NOT AN EXPLANATION THAT CAN BY ITSELF OVERCOME THIS POINT BECAUSE FREE WILL IS AN EQUALLY PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE WOULD FIND GOOD IN A WORLD CREATED BY AN EVIL GOD

THAT SEEMS RIGHT TO ME AS FAR AS IT GOES BUT IT SEEMS TO MISS MAYBE A VERY IMPORTANT THING I THINK THAT MOST THEISTS WHO BELIEVE IN A GOOD GOD DO SO FOR REASONS LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CLAIM THAT THE WORLD IS A GOOD IS WHY ITS CALLED THE PROBLEM OF EVIL ITS ONLY A PROBLEM TO THEM BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT THERE ARE STRONG REASONS INDEPENDENT OF THE OBSERVED EXPERIENCED EVIL OF AND IN THE WORLD FOR THEM TO BELIVE IN A GOOD GOD FREE WILL IS USED TO EXPLAIN EVIL IN THIS WORLD BUT THE ONLY REASON IT CALLS SO STRONGLY FOR AN EXPLANATION IS THE INDEPENDENT BELIEF IN A GOOD GOD

SO I THINK MOST THEISTS WOULD GRANT THAT FREE WILL IS AN EQUALLY GOOD EXPLANATION FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD IF AN EVIL GOD WERE ASSUMED TO EXIST AND THEN SHRUG

THEY WOULD SAY THAT THEY HAVE NO OR FEW INDEPENDENT REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN EVIL GOD SO THERE IS NO NEED TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM OF GOOD WHAT IS ACCOMPLISHED BY SHOWING THAT FREE WILL COULD ADDRESS A PROBLEM OF GOOD AS WELL AS IT COULD ADDRESS A PROBLEM OF EVIL

AM I OFF BASE OR MISSING SOMETHING OBVIOUS I THINK I MUST BE FAILING TO SEE SOME CONTEXT OR ADDITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS OF THE ARGUMENT
I LOVE THE ANIMATION AND I ULTIMATELY AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSIONS THAT SAID THOUGH I DON'T SEE THE GOOD GOD FREE WILL JUSTIFICATION AND THE EVIL GOD FREE WILL JUSTIFICATION AS EQUIVALENT SINCE I THINK THAT FREE WILL CAN BE SEEN AS A GOOD IN AND OF ITSELF BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME CONCEIVING OF IT AS AN EVIL IN AND OF ITSELF WHICH IS TO SAY A GOOD GOD ACTUALLY GETS SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE FOR THE SUFFERING BY ALLOWING FREE WILL WHICH IS FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT GOOD IT MAY BE THAT FREE WILL IS SUCH A GOOD THAT IT COMPENSATES FOR THE SUFFERING WHICH STEM FROM ITS ATTENDANT CHOICES SO A GOD WHO IS GOOD AND WANTS TO BRING GOOD INTO THE WORLD MAY BE DOING SO BUT I HAVE A HARDER TIME WRAPPING MY HEAD AROUND THE ARGUMENT THAT AN EVIL GOD WHO WANTED TO MAKE THE WORLD A HORRIBLE PLACE WOULD GAIN SOMETHING BY CUTTING THE STRINGS AND ALLOWING FOR FREE WILL OR THAT THE PRESENCE OF FREE WILL MIGHT ITSELF BE AN EVIL THAT WOULD THUS COMPENSATE THE EVIL GOD FOR THE GOOD CHOICES SOME OF US MIGHT THEREBY MAKE
MAYBE GOD KNOWS IT'S GOOD TO EXPERIENCE BOTH GOOD AND EVIL SO YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE DEPTHS AND DISTINCTION OF BOTH THE INHERENT SELF DESTRUCTION THAT COMES FROM PURSUING EITHER ARGUES THE NECESSITY OF BOTH
I DON'T LIKE THIS ARGUMENT BECAUSE THE GENERAL MODERN CONSENSUS IS THAT FREE WILL IS A GOOD THING EVIL GOD WOULD NOT CUT THE STRINGS FOR THE SAKE OF GIVING FREE WILL REGARDLESS OF WHAT HE WANTS US TO DO WITH IT

THE ARGUMENT FOR GOOD GOD CUTTING THE STRINGS IS THAT HE VALUES FREE WILL MORE THAN GOODNESS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY A WORLD WITH FREE WILL IS BETTER THAN A WORLD WHERE THERE IS NOTHING BAD THEREFORE FREE WILL IS GOOD

ALONG THE SAME VEIN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO BE CONTROLLED THEREFORE PUPPET GOD WOULD BE CONSIDERED EVIL

IN THE END HOWEVER THIS IS A SHALLOW CONVERSATION BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT THIS ARGUMENT WORKS IS A MATTER OF HOW CLOSELY THESE GODS MATCH THE HUMAN OPINION OF GOOD AND EVIL PEOPLE THEMSELVES CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON WHAT'S GOOD AND WHAT EVIL CLEARLY THERE IS A WHOLE SPECTRUM BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL AND EACH POINT ON THE SPECTRUM COULD BE INTERPRETED DIFFERENTLY BY A DIFFERENT PERSON OR GOD

THESE KIND OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS SEEM SILLY TO ME BECAUSE IT REQUIRES A CLOSE-MINDED STARTING POINT OF DEFINING GOOD AND EVIL THINGS THIS SUBJECTIVE SIMPLY CAN'T PROVIDE CONCRETE CONCLUSIONS


A THOUGHTFUL ARGUMENT AND A GOOD VIDEO WITH BEAUTIFUL VISUALS

WHAT I APPRECIATE MOST ABOUT THIS PRESENTATION IS ITS PRODDING APPROACH IT DOESN'T GO ALL OUT IN ASSERTING A POSITION BUT INSTEAD PROVOKES DEBATE
STATISTS ARE BELIED EVIL BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THEY KILLED COMPARED TO ANY OTHER RELIGIONS



ID LIKE TO SEE A GRAPH OF THAT ON R DATAISBEAUTIFUL
ALL THIS DEBATE ABOUT GOD BEING GOOD OR EVIL MAYBE THESE ARE JUST HUMAN CONSTRUCTS IF THERE WAS ANY ULTIMATE CONSCIOUSNESS MAYBE IT DOESN'T CARE WHAT HUMANS DO TO EACH OTHER
THIS IS A TERRIBLE COMPARISON AN EVIL GOD WOULD NEVER CUT THE STRINGS BECAUSE EVIL CONTROLS BY ITS OWN NATURE
THE ARGUMENT FOR A GOOD GOD ISN'T JUST FREE WILLIAM I THINK THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT IN THIS SCENARIO IS WHO DETERMINES WHAT GOOD IS FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE WHO STEALS MAY NOT THINK WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS BAD BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR A LOVED ONE THE MAJORITY OF HUMANITY WOULD SEE THIS AS BAD BECAUSE IT IS TAKING FROM SOMEONE WHO RIGHTFULLY EARNED IT WHO GETS THE SAY IN WHICH SIDE IS GOOD OR BAD

IF YOU ARGUED BECAUSE MOST OF HUMANITY AGREE IT IS BAD THEN GOOD OR BAD RIGHT OR WRONG IS ALWAYS EVOLVING WITH CULTURE AND PERSECUTION OF SLAVES WAS ALWAYS RIGHT BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF HUMANITY AGREED

BUT THEISTS WOULD ARGUE THAT THE IDEA OF A PERFECT LINE THAT DIVIDES GOOD AND BAD DOES NOT COME FROM HUMANITY BUT AN ETERNAL BEING
NOT SURE WHY IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS NO GOD OR AT LEAST IT'S NOT LESS OBVIOUS THAT THERE ISN'T SORRY ABOUT THE DOUBLE NEGATIVES HERE BUT UNOBVIOUS IS A PROBLEMATIC WORD IF WE LOOK AT THE WORLD AND SAY EVERYTHING IN IT BIOLOGICAL AND OTHERWISE HAS SOME CREATOR OR AT LEAST INITIAL AGENT IT WOULD APPEAR OBVIOUS THAT THE SAME HOLDS TRUE OF GALAXIES ISN'T IT LESS OBVIOUS THAT THE KNOWN UNIVERSE HAS NO ORIGIN OR WAS MADE FROM NOTHING I KNOW OF NOTHING IN THE NATURAL WORLD THAT CAME FROM NOTHING CAN YOU SHOW ME AN EXAMPLE THE SUGGESTION IS FANTASTIC NO ONE HAS THE ANSWER IT IS UNKNOWN THERE IS NO CERTAINTY ON EITHER SIDE I AM SUGGESTING A POSSIBILITY BASED UPON THE ONLY EVIDENCE I HAVE WHICH IS OBSERVATIONAL AND ADMITTEDLY FLAWED BUT IT APPEARS MORE OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS SOME ORIGIN I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A BIG WHITE DUDE WITH A BEARD OR EVEN ANY INDIVIDUAL IT COULD BE ARTIFICIALLY GENERATED OR IT MIGHT BE A SIMULATION BOTH OF THESE IMPLY INTELLIGENCE ON THE OTHER END THE ACTOR NEED NOT BE GOOD OR EVIL IN OUR PRIMITIVE UNDERSTANDING

THE MOST DEPRESSING THOUGHT I'VE HAD LATELY IS THAT IN THE AFTERLIFE IF SUCH EXISTS I'LL FIND OUT THAT THINGS ARE CONTROLLED ON OUR PLANET BY THE SAME POLITICIANS KINGS AND EMPERORS WE PUT IN OFFICE IT WOULD EXPLAIN A LOT
NOTE I PLACED THIS COMMENT FURTHER DOWN ONE THREAD BUT AFTER SEEING A LOT OF PEOPLE MISINTERPRET WHAT THE GOAL FUNCTION OF THIS VIDEO PAPER IS I THOUGHT I MIGHT JUST PUT IT UP ON THE TOP LEVEL

I DO NOT THINK THAT HIS ARGUMENT IS MEANT TO EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANY GOD EXISTS JUST THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE REASON TO THINK THAT A SPECIFIC GOD EXISTS I THINK HE IS IN FACT ARGUING SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE LACK OF A GOD DEFINED IN A SPECIFIC WAY WE HAVE TO APPROACH THIS PAPER VIDEO WITHIN THE FRAME OF THE DISCUSSION THAT GAVE BIRTH TO IT THAT IS TO SAY THAT THIS IS MEANT TO BE A REPLY TO THE RELIGIOUS BELIEVER PARTICULARLY CHRISTIAN AND THEIR COMMON STATEMENTS OF BELIEF TO ILLUSTRATE

GENERAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION WHERE DID THE UNIVERSE COME FROM OR WHY IS IT HERE

XTIAN MY GOD CREATED AND SUSTAINS THE UNIVERSE ONLY MY GOD EXISTS AND HE CAN BE DEFINED AS OMNIPOTENT OMNISCIENT AND OMNIBENEVOLENT

LAW A GOD AS YOU HAVE DEFINED IT CANNOT EXIST DUE TO THE STATE OF THE WORLD

XTIAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN

LAW WELL THE PROBLEM OF EVIL SUFFERING E S THE WORLD IS FULL OF EVIL YOUR GOD AS YOU HAVE DEFINED IT WOULD COULD NOT ALLOW THE WORLD TO BE SO FULL OF PREVENTABLE E S DUE TO HIS NATURE THEREFORE EITHER YOUR GOD IS UNAWARE OF THE E S AND IS THUS NOT OMNISCIENT 2 UNABLE TO STOP THE E S AND THEREFORE NOT OMNIPOTENT OR IS INDIFFERENT ABOUT OR ENJOYS THE E S AND THEREFORE NOT OMNIBENEVOLENT THEREFORE YOUR GOD AS YOU DEFINE IT CANNOT EXIST

XTIAN GOD ALLOWS E S TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS IS REQUIRED TO ALLOW FREE WILLIAM FREE WILL IS INHERENTLY NECESSARY FOR AGENCY AND THUS IS NECESSARY FOR MORAL ACTION TO EXIST WITHOUT IT WE WOULD BE BLAMELESS ROBOTS AND MORALITY ULTIMATELY SERVES THE HIGHER PURPOSE HE AS CONSTRUCTED US AND THE UNIVERSE FOR THROUGH THIS FREE WILL AND OUR SINNING E S ENTERS THE WORLD

LAW THIS ARGUMENT HOWEVER CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD OF ANY NATURE FOR INSTANCE THE EVIL GOD VIDEO PAPER EXISTS HERE IF THE WORLD WE SEE BEFORE US IS EQUALLY VIABLE EVIDENCE FOR A MORALLY OPPOSED SUPREME BEING TO THE ONE YOU BELIEVE IN OR ANYTHING IN BETWEEN THEN THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE IN PRECISELY YOUR GOD AND THEREFORE IT IS A POOR EXPLANATION FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE UNIVERSE WHILE THIS DOES NOT DISPROVE THE EXISTENCE OF YOUR GOD OR ANY OTHER GOD IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER YOUR GOD IS ANY MORE LIKELY THAT ANY OTHER GOD TO PUT A FINE POINT ON IT THE WORLD WE SEE MOST STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE EXISTENCE OF EITHER AN INDIFFERENT GOD A MORALLY NIHILISTIC GOD A GOD UNABLE TO MEANINGFULLY CHANGE THINGS AN ABSENT GOD DEIST OR A GOD THAT DOES NOT EXIST YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DEFEND YOUR FAITH IN OTHER WAYS BUT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM

EDIT AND AS THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES WITH THOSE MAKING THE POSITIVE ASSERTION IT IS UPON THE XTIAN TO DO SO

HIS CONCLUSION IS COMPLETELY COUNTERINTUITIVE

EVIL GOD AND GOD GOD ARE BOTH POSSIBLE

OK HE SHOWS HOW YOU CAN ARGUE THIS

2 EVIL GOD IS UNLIKELY BECAUSE THE WORLD IS TO NICE

A BIT ARBITRARY BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR REASONING

SINCE WE CAN GUESS THERE IS NO EVIL GOD THERE PROBABLY ISN'T A GOOD GOD

WAIT WAIT THE PROOF FOR YOU TO SAY THERE PROBABLY ISN'T AN EVIL GOD IS THAT THE WORLD IS TO GOOD THAT PROOF THEN BY DEFAULT MUST LEND ITSELF TO THE IDEA THAT A GOOD GOD IS MORE LIKELY AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT AN EQUAL CHANCE OF EITHER GOD ALTHOUGH BOTH ARE POSSIBLE

TOTALLY FALLS APART AT THE CONCLUSION LIKE MOST PHILOSOPHERS HE STARTED WITH AND IDEA HE WANTED TO PROVE AND TWISTED HIS LOGIC TO PROVE IT

THAT'S WHY IN ALMOST EVERY RELIGION GOD HAS A COUNTERPART OR THERE IS ANOTHER GOD THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING THAT THE MAIN GOD WOULD NOT WANT THERE WAS ANUBIS HADES LUCIFER GODS OF THE UNDERWORLD GODS OF DEATH AND SUCH THE EVIL GOD ARGUMENT HAS ITS LIMITS BECAUSE RELATES FAITH TO A GOD AND NOT FAITH TO THE EROTISM OF IMMORTALITY

GOOD OR EVIL IS THE PROBLEM GOOD AND EVIL ARE HUMANS INTERPRETATION OF OUR PHENOMENOLOGICAL LIVES AND GOD EVILNESS OR GOODNESS DEPENDS ON CULTURAL CONSTRUCTIONS MANY RELIGIONS SEE THE GODS OF OTHER RELIGIONS AS THE COUNTERPART OF THEIR OWN GOD IN OTHER AGES MANY CULTURES HAD RITUALS OF SACRIFICE TO THEIR GOD AND TODAY WE COULD ASSUME THAT A GOD WHO DEMANDED SUCH RITUAL IS EVIL
IF WE WERE BORN WITH NO EYES AND HAD NO CONCEPT OF LIGHT WHAT SO EVER WOULD WE EVEN CONSIDER LIGHT WOULD IT EVEN EXIST IN OUR IMAGINATION WHY DO WE EVEN HAVE A CURIOSITY OF AN IDEA THAT DOESN'T EXIST TO SOME EXTENT

AND WHY DO WE ARGUE ABOUT IT IF WE TRULY BELIEVE EITHER SIDE FOR INSTANCE IF A CHRISTIAN REALLY BELIEVES THAT WE ARE SAVED WHY ARGUE WITH SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE THEY ARE SAVED WOULDN'T YOU JUST LET THEM BE IN PEACE WITH WHAT THEY BELIEVED AND KNOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE TRUE LIKEWISE IF RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ARE ALL NUTS WHY CONVINCE THEM WHAT YOU KNOW TO BE TRUE

WHAT IS THE POINT PRIDE SATISFACTION IN CRUSHING SOMEONE'S THEORY OR IS IT AN UNSATISFIABLE THIRST TO KNOW SOMETHING AND NOT SPECULATE ARGUING TO BE RIGHT GETS US NO WHERE BUT BACK TO AN EXHAUSTING SQUARE ONE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S SOMEONE'S OPINION BECAUSE NEITHER CAN BE PROVEN BY THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND AN ARGUMENT BASED ON PERSONAL OPINION IS A FALLACY FROM THE START
THE PREMISE IS WRONG AT LEAST WITH REGARDS TO BEING A CRITIQUE OF THE CHRISTIAN JEWISH GOD WE BELIEVE TO BE GOOD

GOODNESS COMES FROM GOD WHAT HE WISHES TO SEE IS GOOD WHAT HE ABHORS IS BAD THAT'S THE CENTRE OF CHRISTIAN MORALITY THERE CAN'T BE A BAD GOD CAPITAL G BECAUSE WITH AN ALL POWERFUL OMNISCIENT CREATOR WHAT HE SAYS IS MORAL IS MORAL WHY DO WE KNOW THAT THIEVERY IS WRONG BECAUSE GOD HAS MADE IT THAT WAY

WITHOUT GOD ONLY OUR SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS ON CERTAIN MATTERS CAN CONSTITUTE GOOD OR EVIL

THIS EXPLANATION PROPOSES THAT BECAUSE THERE IS NO EVIL GOD AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THERE IS NO EVIL GOD THEREFORE THERE IS NO GOOD GOD EITHER THIS IS NO KIND OF LOGIC AT ALL YOU CAN CALL GOD EVIL IF YOU WANT YOU CAN THINK THAT THE PRESCRIPTIONS IN THE BIBLE ARE EVIL THERE'S NOTHING HERE AT DISPROVING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AT ALL JUST AN INCORRECT PREMISE THAT ASSUMES GOODNESS IS AN ESTABLISHED TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE SOMETHING WHICH INCREDIBLY IRONICALLY SOUNDS VERY RELIGIOUS TO ME
EVIL IS NOT ON METAPHYSICAL PAR WITH GOOD
SO BASICALLY NOTHING IS SOLVED AND WE CAN ALL KEEP BELIEVING WHAT WE BELIEVE WONDERFUL
THIS ARGUMENT IS APPEALING TO OUR PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS OF GOOD AND EVIL WHICH ARE BOTH SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS TO ARGUE AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD IN DOING SO HE IS ASSUMING THAT GOD FALLS INTO THE SAME ONTOLOGICAL BRACKET AS GOOD AND EVIL AND IS THEREFORE ALSO A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT AND THEREFORE DOES NOT EXIST

IT'S LIKE ARGUING THAT THE TOOTH FAIRY DOESN'T EXIST BECAUSE SHE ISN'T GENEROUS TO ALL CHILDREN I MEAN SHE DOESN'T EXIST BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
AN EVIL GOD WOULD HAPPILY TAKE AWAY OUR FREE WILL I WOULD ARGUE BECAUSE GIVING US A FREE GIFT SUCH AS FREE WILL IS INHERENTLY GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL THIS WOULD PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF GOD BEING EVIL
HEHE ARGUMENT WE'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT MILLION YEARS ARGUING AND THE COWS STILL HAVEN'T RETURNED HERE'S THE PROVABLE STATS AS I UNDERSTAND THEM
PROBABILITY THAT GOD EXISTS INFINITE
PROBABILITY THAT NO GOD EXISTS INFINITE
PROBABILITY YOU'LL FIND OUT THE DEFINITE ANSWER IN THIS LIFETIME
PROBABILITY A POTENTIAL GOD IS GOOD OR EVIL IRRELEVANT PER THE THIRD PROBABILITY RANGE
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BIT OF TEACHING IT GIVES AN ACCEPTED IDEA BREAKS IT DOWN GIVES A PROPOSED SOLUTION THEN LEAVES THE WHOLE THING OPEN FOR MORE DISCUSSION

ONE TOPIC I HAVE SEEN COME UP IS THE NOTION OF FREE WILL VS INSTINCT IF YOU LOOK AT ANY BASIC NEED YOU CAN COMPARE THESE THINGS LOOKING AT MATING FROM A HUMAN EXPERIENCE IS AN EASY PLACE TO SHOW WHAT I MEAN

INSTINCTUALLY WE AS AN ORGANISM HAVE A BASIC DESIRE TO REPRODUCE WHICH IS WHY HAVING SEX IS GENERALLY ENJOYABLE THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO LOOK AT SEX FROM A FREE WILL VIEWPOINT SAY A MAN AND A WOMAN CONSENSUALLY HAVE SEX AND CONCEIVE A CHILD THIS FALLS UNDER THE NOTION OF GOOD BECAUSE THE REPRODUCTIVE DESIRES ARE SATISFIED AND THIS RELATIONSHIP IS ACCEPTABLE THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THE IDEA OF BESTIALITY THIS RELATIONSHIP WOULD FALL UNDER THE REALM OF BAD BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY EITHER BEING CAN REPRODUCE AND THE RELATIONSHIP IS ACCEPTED BOTH ARE CHOICES OF FREE WILL AND CAN SHOW HOW ONE CAN CHOOSE GOOD OR BAD

UNDER THE REALM OF FREE WILL THERE ARE OTHER CHOICES FOR MATING TWO MEN CAN HAVE RELATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AND CONSENT TO IT RIGHT NOW THIS IS A GENERALLY ACCEPTED LIFESTYLE BUT THERE CAN BE NO REPRODUCTION FROM A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT THIS IS A GOOD THING FROM A NATURAL PERSPECTIVE IT IS BAD ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE THINK OF A RAPIST WHO IMPREGNATES HIS VICTIM SOCIALLY THIS IS BAD BECAUSE RAPE NATALLY IT IS GOOD BECAUSE BABY

LIKE THE VIDEO I WILL NOT PROVIDE ANSWERS HOPEFULLY EVERYONE CAN CONTINUE TO THINK WHAT THEY WANT WHAT I HOPED TO SHOW WAS THAT INSTINCTS CAN BE SATISFIED BY MANY DIFFERENT MEANS THAT IT IS OUR SOCIETY AND PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS THAT JUDGE WHETHER SOMETHING IS GOOD OR BAD AND NOT NATURE
ANY ADDITIONAL READING RELATING TO THIS
IS THIS GUY A PROFESSOR THIS ARGUMENT IS AWFUL WE CAN BE PRETTY SURE THERE ISN'T AN EVIL GOD SO WHY SHOULD WE THINK THERE IS A GOOD GOD I DON'T THINK HE'S COME EVEN CLOSE TO BEING PRETTY SURE THERE ISN'T AN EVIL GOD
I FIND THE PROBLEM WITH THIS ENTIRE PIECE IS THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS ENTERTAINING WE ARE STILL OPERATING IN THE ASSUMPTION THAT A GOD ASSUMING THEIR IS OR ARE GODS CAN INHERENTLY GOOD OR INHERENTLY EVIL I DON'T KNOW THINK IT'S EVEN NECESSARY TO USE THE EVIL GOD ARGUMENT TO DENOUNCE RELIGION YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO GO THAT FAR ONCE YOU ACCEPT THAT IT IS LOGICAL TO CONCLUDE THAT PRESUPPOSITIONAL APOLOGETICS ARE SELF-REFUTING THE ARGUMENTS AFTERWARDS LIKE THE ONE IN THE VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE BECOME AN EXERCISE OF EXPENDING HOT AIR AND FALLACIES DEFINITELY HOT AIR AND FALLACIES
IT'S HARD TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT THERE COULD BE AN ALL GOOD OR ALL BAD GOD SINCE GOOD AND BAD ARE FOR THE MOST PART SUBJECTIVE WHAT SEEMS ALRIGHT TO AN ALL POWERFUL BEING COULD BE DEEMED TERRIBLE BY HUMAN STANDARDS
ONCE AGAIN HIS IGNORANCE OF PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY IS SHOWING EVIL IS A LACK OF GOODNESS GOODNESS IS INHERENT TO BEING BY FAILING TO RECOGNIZE OR ADMIT THESE FUNDAMENTAL AXIOMS HE MISUNDERSTANDS THE ARGUMENT AND PRESENTS AN ABSURD REFUTATION
GOOD CREATION
EVIL DESTRUCTION
THERE IS A REAL DIFFERENCE A GOOD GOD LEADS TO A DECREASE IN ENTROPY MORE INFORMATION GROWTH A BAD GOD LEADS TO NOTHINGNESS HOMOGENEOUS GREY GOO IN THAT RESPECT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS GOOD AND EVIL AND GOOD MUST TRIUMPH THIS IS WHY TRIAL BY BATTLE WORKS BECAUSE THE WINNER IS THE MORE INNOVATIVE
WHAT IF GOOD AND EVIL ARE JUST CONSTRUCTS WHAT IF HUMANS ARE NOT PART OF THE TRUE MORAL ORDER WHAT IF WHAT HAPPENS TO US DOES NOT MATTER WHAT IF THE UNIVERSE WAS MADE FOR SOMEONE ELSE OR FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE WHAT IF WE'RE COLLATERAL DAMAGE OF CREATION


GOD MAY BE INDIFFERENT OR IMPARTIAL OR OUR CONCEPTION OF GOOD AND EVIL MAY BE FLAWED OR INSUFFICIENT AFTER ALL IF THERE IS A GOD THEN ONE ASSUMES THAT GOD WOULD HAVE A RADICALLY DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF THESE CONCEPTS ATHEISM AS A BELIEF SYSTEM IS EVERY BIT AS RADICAL AS A FAITH BASED BELIEF SYSTEM TO SAY THERE IS NO GOD ONE MUST ULTIMATELY MAKE A LEAP OF FAITH PROVE TO ME THERE IS NO GOD YOU MUST DO BETTER THAN THE SOPHOMORIC ARGUMENT PRESENTED HERE
WE CANNOT KNOW ANYTHING SO SURELY NEITHER ARE TRUE

WHAT A WEAK LOGIC
REMOVED
NO SEE GOD EXISTS OUTSIDE OF TIME DUE TO HIS NATURE OUTSIDE THE LAWS OF CAUSALITY IT IS POSSIBLE FOR EVIL TO EXISTS WITHOUT HIM CREATING IT THAT IS THE NATURE OF OMNIPOTENCE AND OMNISCIENCE ORIGINAL SIN WAS THE CHOICE OF HUMANITY TO PRIORITIZE THEMSELVES OVER GOD

GOD DOES NOT WANT SLAVES THAT ARE FORCED TO DO HIS WILLIAM BECAUSE HE LOVES US SO MUCH HE GIVES ALL HIS CREATIONS THE CHOICE TO CHOOSE HIM THE ANGELS CHOSE ONCE AND WITH THE TOTAL SUM OF THEIR BEING WE AS UNIQUE CREATURES MADE BY GOD WERE ALSO GIVEN A CHOICE WE MADE THE WRONG ONE WE LOCKED OURSELVES INTO A PERFECT LOGIC TRAP IN WHICH WE COULD NOT FREE OURSELVES DUE TO OUR NATURE BY CHOOSING OURSELVES OVER GOD WE SHUT GOD OUT WE DENIED HIM TURNING AWAY FROM HIM

BUT HERE'S WHERE GOD WAS CLEVER HE LEFT A BACKDOOR ENTRANCE INTO THE PRISON THAT WE MADE OURSELVES THE ABILITY TO REPRODUCE THE ABILITY THAT OF ALL CREATIONS ONLY HUMANS HAVE IS THE ABILITY TO BY COMBINING THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES ARE ABLE TO CREATE ANOTHER PHYSICAL PLATFORM INTO WHICH GOD PLACES A SOUL

OK NOW THIS IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY COOL GOD AS HE WAS ABLE TO INSERT NEW SOULS INTO REALITY WAS ABLE TO INCARNATE HIMSELF HE BASICALLY JURY-RIGGED REALITY TO SAVE US FROM OURSELVES HE WAS ABLE TO COME TO REALITY IN THE FORM OF JESUS CHRIST AS A HUMAN AND CHANGE OUR VERY BEING HE BROKE OPEN THE REALITY THAT HE ALLOWED US TO CLOSE BY TAKING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHOICE OF ORIGINAL SIN UNTO HIMSELF HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD BEAR IT HE PAID FOR OUR MISTAKE

AND HE WAS HAPPY TO HE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME AS MANY TIMES AS IT TAKES BECAUSE HE LOVES US UNCONDITIONALLY DUE TO THAT SACRIFICE WE CAN NOW ENTER HEAVEN AND EMBRACE GOD ONCE MORE WITH AN EVEN GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND LOVE FOR HIM BECAUSE OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS WE HAVE GONE THROUGH SO NOW BECAUSE GOD STILL LOVES US TO SUCH AN EXTENT HE STILL ALLOWS US TO CHOOSE HIM OF OUR OWN ACCORD AND BY DOING SO COME TO AN EVEN GREATER APPRECIATION OF HIM

BLDR GOD REALITY TO SAVE US FROM OURSELVES
ACTUALLY THERE IS A RELIGION THAT BELIEVES THE CREATOR GOD IS EVIL IT'S CALLED GNOSTICISM THEY VIEW THE SUPREME GOD TO BE A DIALECTICAL COMBINATION OF BOTH GOOD AND EVIL THE CONCLUSION REACHED BY THIS VIDEO IS PRETTY LAZY RELIGIONS THAT HAVE A GOOD GOD ALSO HAVE AN EVIL GOD DEVIL REALLY THIS IS JUST SOME ATHEIST THAT THINKS HE CAME UP WITH A GOOD ARGUMENT BUT DOESN'T HAVE THE PHILOSOPHICAL WHEREWITHAL TO NOTICE THE FLAWS IN HIS OWN ARGUMENT

THE BOX PROBLEM ISN'T A PROBLEM ABOUT WHAT CHOICE YOU SHOULD MAKE WHEN THE GENIE PREDICTS YOUR MIND THAT ONE'S EASY JUST INTEND TO PICK THE SINGLE BOX OR WHAT CHOICE YOU SHOULD MAKE IF YOU AGGREGATE THE PREDICTION CHOICE AND THE ACTUAL CHOICE AS YOU'VE DONE OR ABOUT WHAT SORT OF PERSON YOU SHOULD BE WHEN THE GENIE MAKES A COPY OF YOU TO FEED INTO A TURING MACHINE AS YOU'VE ALSO DONE THOSE ARE ALL TRIVIAL PROBLEMS AND THEY ARE NOT THE BOX PROBLEM

THE BOX PROBLEM IS A PROBLEM ABOUT WHAT CHOICE TO MAKE ONCE YOU'RE PRESENTED WITH THOSE BOXES NO MATTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST THIS IS WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE TWO BOXERS ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE BOXES IN FRONT OF YOU IT'S TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT WHICH BOXES YOU PICK THE MONEY IS ALREADY IN THE BOXES AND YOU CAN EITHER GRAB BOTH BOXES OR JUST ONE BOX

BECAUSE YOU'VE IGNORED THE ACTUAL QUESTION AND ANSWERED A BUNCH OF IRRELEVANT QUESTIONS YOU'VE FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTION YOU'VE PROVIDED IS NOT PARTICULARLY HELPFUL
THIS PROBLEM ISN'T TRICKY FOR A HUMAN BUT IT'S MODERATELY AWKWARD TO FORMALIZE IN A WAY THAT'S FRIENDLY TOWARD AN OTHER CONCEPTIONS OF TIME AND CAUSALITY IT'S EVEN MORE AWKWARD BECAUSE THIS ONLY APPLIES WHEN MAKING DECISIONS WHOSE OUTCOME WILL IMPACT OTHER AGENTS DECISIONS WHERE THOSE AGENTS ARE ABLE TO PREDICT WHAT WE WILL DECIDE

SEE ALSO TIMELESS DECISION THEORY

EDIT ANOTHER WAY TO MODEL THIS IS TO PRETEND THAT YOU ARE THE SIMULATION THAT THE OTHER AGENT IS RUNNING YOU ARE CHOOSING FAKE DOLLARS OR FAKE DOLLARS AND IF YOU CHOOSE THE LATTER YOUR REAL SELF WILL ONLY GAIN THIS EXPLICITLY REFLECTS THE IDEA THAT THE OTHER AGENT IS MAKING PREDICTIONS
PHILOSOPHY IS ENDLESSLY TOYING WITH THESE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS AND FAILING ABSOLUTELY TO STEP INTO REALITY AND MEASURE WHAT IS REAL OUTSIDE OF THESE FORCED HEGELIAN DIALECTICS YEARS AGO PHILOSOPHY WAS INTELLECTUAL NOW ITS BECOME HEGELIAN DIALECTICS NONE OF WHICH MAKES ANY SENSE

YOUR POSITION IN QM AND SCIENCE IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIVE IN AN ABSOLUTELY DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM RANDOM CHANCE IS STACKED INTO AND LEANED INTO THE SYSTEM ITS NOT EITHER OR ITS NOT BLACK OR WHITE IS YIN AND YANG BOTH DETERMINISM AND RANDOMNESS OPERATE IN THE REAL UNIVERSE TOGETHER

THUS ANY COPY YOU MAKE IS FIRSTLY A POOR COPY DUE TO THE NO PERFECT COPY LAW OF QM AND SECONDLY OPERATES BOTH WITH THE DETERMINISTIC EFFECTS AND THE RANDOM EFFECTS OF REALITY IN PLAY

THUS A COPY OF YOU WON'T MAKE EXACTLY THE SAME CHOICES YOU WOULD MAKE AND IN FACT OVER TIME YOUR POSITIONS WOULD LOSE PHASE AND DISENTANGLE FROM EACH OTHER AND THE RANDOMNESS WOULD OVER POWER THE DETERMINISM AND YOU'D BE DOING AND THINKING DIFFERENT THINGS AND MAKING DIFFERENT CHOICES

ALL OF THIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT ONLY WORKS IN A RIGIDLY DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE THAT HASN'T GOT RANDOM CHANCE SUCH A UNIVERSE IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE A STARKLY DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE WOULD CRYSTALIZE INTO ITS ABSOLUTE CAUSES AND EFFECTS FREEZE AT ITS DETERMINISTIC OUTCOME

IN REVERSE OF THAT IF THE UNIVERSE WERE MORE RANDOM THE QUANTA WOULDN'T HOLD TOGETHER ETC FUNDAMENTAL LAWS WOULDN'T WORK THE UNIVERSE IS BALANCED PRECISELY IN THE MIDDLE HALF RANDOM HALF DETERMINISTIC THE INTERESTING THING THERE IS TO ASK OURSELVES WHY WE LIVE IN A UNIVERSE THAT IS SO WELL BALANCED A LOT LIKE ASKING OURSELVES WHAT THE ODDS WERE OF LIVING ON A PLANET PRECISELY CENTERED IN THE SOLAR GREEN ZONE FOR ITS GRAVITY AND WATER CONTENTION OR HOW WE END UP WITH A MOON THAT EXACTLY VISUALLY ECLIPSES THE SUN APPEARING THE EXACT SAME SIZE AS THE SUN IN THE SKY ETC

THOSE ARE THE INTERESTING QUESTIONS TO ASK HOW THE UNIVERSE ENDS UP IN SUCH AN INTERESTING BALANCE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS WHICH ASSUME A DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE AREN'T REALLY THAT INTERESTING BOTH BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE IS NOT RIGIDLY DETERMINISTIC AND BECAUSE THUS THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS ASSUME A UNIVERSE A ZILLION TIMES SIMPLER THAN THE ONE WE LIVE INSIDE OF
HERE'S SOMETHING I NEVER UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT DREAMING ARGUMENT DOES IT NOT RELY ON THE FACT THAT WE ONLY FEEL CONVINCED THAT WE'RE AWAKE WHEN WE'RE DREAMING BECAUSE OUR ATTENTION IS NOT FOCUSED ON WHETHER WE ARE IN FACT DREAMING OR NOT IS IT NOT TRUE THAT WERE YOU TO STOP WITHIN A DREAM AND GENUINELY INQUIRE AS TO WHETHER YOU ARE AWAKE OR NOT YOU WOULD EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THAT YOU IN FACT ARE DREAMING

I MEAN WE KNOW THIS IS POSSIBLE LUCID DREAMERS DO IT ALL THE TIME THERE ARE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT JUST DON'T APPEAR TO TRANSLATE WELL INTO FOR EXAMPLE AN ABILITY TO DELINEATE AN UNBROKEN CHAIN OF EVENTS FROM WHERE YOU ARE NOW TO WHERE YOU WERE SAY A WEEK AGO I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SOMEONE BEING ABLE TO DO THIS WITHIN A DREAM IN FACT I HAVE READ THAT THE QUESTION HOW DID I GET HERE IS A COMMON ONE THAT PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO LEARN HOW TO LUCID DREAM WILL ASK THEMSELVES AS A REALITY CHECK OR LITERALLY A WAY OF DISCERNING WHETHER YOU ARE OR ARE NOT DREAMING

SO LIKE THIS ISN'T A REAL DEBATE ANYMORE RIGHT AT LEAST NOT THIS SPECIFIC EXAMPLE
THIS THREAD IS NOW LOCKED ALMOST NONE OF THE COMMENTS RESPOND TO THE CONTENT OF THE OP AND A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF COMMENTS CONSISTS OF MEAN-SPIRITED BICKERING

ANY DISCUSSION OF ETHICAL MATTERS ANY APPLICATION OF ETHICS IN SUCH FIELDS AS SCIENCE MEDICINE BUSINESS OR PUBLIC POLICY ETC IS ALREADY SOCIALLY RELEVANT AND APPLIED PHILOSOPHY

FUNNY IN THAT MATHEMATICS PLACES A HIGH ER PREMIUM ON RIGOUR MAKES NO CLAIMS AS TO ANY FORM OF SIGNIFICANCE WHATSOEVER AND DOESN'T SEEM ANY WORSE FOR WEAR
IT'S NOT JUST A PROBLEM OF THEORETICAL RIGOUR IT'S TRUE THAT ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY SEEMS FAR REMOVED FROM PRACTICAL ISSUES BUT EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS THE LINGERING INFLUENCE OF A CERTAIN KIND OF THOUGHT ASSOCIATED WITH DERRID AND COMPANY WHICH I DO NOT EQUATE WITH CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY

THIS HAS ENGULFED THE HUMANITIES MORE SO THAN PHILOSOPHY ITSELF ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC NOW FOR EVERY SERIOUS PHILOSOPHER THERE'S A DOZEN PEOPLE FROM LITERATURE SOCIOLOGY ANTHROPOLOGY AND OTHER INTELLECTUALS WHO USE PHILOSOPHY IN A SKEPTICAL MANNER I MEAN SKEPTICISM IN THE ANCIENT SENSE CRITICIZING EVERYTHING UNTIL NOTHING IS KNOWN AND NOTHING MAKES SENSE DENYING THAT ANYTHING CAN BE KNOWN REFUSING TO ACCEPT THAT EVEN WHEN NOTHING IS CERTAIN SHAKY FOUNDATIONS ARE OFTEN SUFFICIENT IT IS RATHER UNSURPRISING THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING FROM SOCIAL WORKERS TO SCIENTISTS WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS WAY OF THINKING

THIS HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE IN TRYING TO COLLABORATE WITH THE HUMANITIES WITHIN MY OWN FIELD IN BOTH THE EU AND NORTH AMERICA I'VE FOUND SURPRISINGLY STRONG ANIMOSITY TOWARDS PHILOSOPHY FROM OTHERWISE OPEN-MINDED SCIENTISTS CLEARLY BOTH SIDES ARE AT FAULT BUT IT IS PRIMARILY THE HUMANITIES WHO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO DENOUNCE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AS LONG AS THIS OCCURS THEY WILL BE MARGINALIZED BECAUSE THE CASE FOR SCIENCE IS SIMPLY TOO EASY TO MAKE WHEREAS THE CASE FOR PHILOSOPHY AND MORE GENERALLY FOR THE HUMANITIES IS MORE SUBTLE
I'M A BIT OUT OF MY HIGHER EDUCATION FOCUS ON THIS ONE BUT IS THERE NOT AN EQUIVALENT SET OF PURE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING APPLIED SCIENCE DISCIPLINES IN PHILOSOPHY I MEAN ECONOMICS USED TO BE BEFORE NCE AND THE BIG BUY A DISCIPLINE OF PHILOSOPHY ARE THERE NOT USEFUL ROLES FOR BOTH APPLIED AND PHILOSOPHY

I HAD A CLASS IN ELEMENTARY SYMBOLIC LOGIC MY HIGHEST LEVEL PHILOSOPHY COURSE AND IT SEEMS THAT AI CHANGES IN THE LABOR MARKET DUE TO AUTOMATION ETC WILL ALL REQUIRE PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHERS HOW DO YOU CALIBRATE THE NEURAL NET FOR PASSENGER VS PEDESTRIAN VALUE IN A CAR BY HIRING THE APPROPRIATE SPECIALISTS
BRINGS TO MIND A LINE I READ ONE TIME DON'T STUDY PHILOSOPHY PRACTICE IT I THINK THIS IS A DISTINCTION THAT DESERVES SOME THOUGHT

OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T REALLY PRACTICE PHILOSOPHY WITH NO FORM OF STUDY AT ALL BUT I THINK THERE IS A KERNEL OF TRUTH IN THERE

IF WE ARE TO CHANGE POLICY WE GENERALLY NEED TO CHANGE OURSELVES FIRST EVERYONE WANTS CHANGE FEW WANT TO CHANGE ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY IS HIGHLY INACCESSIBLE TO MOST PEOPLE AND THIS PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED BY ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHERS WHOSE MAIN CONCERN IS READING AND WRITING ABOUT SAID INACCESSIBLE LITERATURE

IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN THAT THOSE WHO WRITE HAVE NO TIME TO LIVE WHILE THOSE WHO LIVE HAVE NO TIME TO WRITE KAZANTZAKIS ZOBA THE GREEK THIS SEEMS ANALOGOUS TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN STUDYING AND PRACTICING FRIENDS IN THEOLOGY WOULD SIMILARLY POINT OUT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE TOO ENGROSSED IN BIBLICAL STUDY WHEN MAYBE THEY COULD BENEFIT MORE BY GETTING THEIR NOSE OUT OF THE BOOKS PRACTICING RELIGION AND ACTUALLY BEING I EAST PEACEFUL GENEROUS PEOPLE INSTEAD OF JUST CONTINUING TO ANALYZE TEXT

I THINK THIS DOES AFFECT PLENTY OF PHILOSOPHERS TOO THIS IS WHY ALTHOUGH I WAS A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR I'M NOT A CAREER PATH IS MY CALLING BUT THIS DOESN'T MEAN I'M NO LONGER PRACTICING PHILOSOPHY

LET PHILOSOPHY BE SOMETHING THAT IS LIVED IN THE WORLD AND CELEBRATED IN PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS AND MAYBE WE'LL SEE SOME IMPROVEMENT PHILOSOPHY HAS A LOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO TOPICS IT HAS DONE SO SINCE PLATO AND PROBABLY EVEN BEFORE THE COURSE THAT INSPIRED ME TO DECLARE THE MAJOR WAS ALL ABOUT THE PERSON AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
I DON'T BELIEVE AN OPEN FORUM IS ENOUGH AS PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A JOKE AMONG THE VERY DISCIPLINES THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM IT PHILOSOPHY IS IN A DANGEROUS POSITION AS IS SOCIETY
IN HER BRILLIANT BOOK HOW TO DO THINGS WITH PORNOGRAPHY NANCY BAUER DOES A GREAT JOB OF CRITIQUING THE PRESENT PRACTICE OF PHILOSOPHY AS ANALOGUE TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PROGRAMS BECAUSE MODERN PHILOSOPHERS ARE TYPICALLY HOLED AWAY IN ACADEMIA THE SOCRATIC PRACTICE OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIAL CRITICISM STIRRING SHIT UP UP IN THE POLIS HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY GIVEN WAY TO THE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE OF PHILOSOPHY SOCRATES AND MARX SHOULD BE MODELS AS PHILOSOPHERS WHO WERE CIVICALLY ENGAGED THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HAVING AN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE OF PHILOSOPHY PER SE IT'S SIMPLY SHOULD NOT SO THOROUGHLY OVERSHADOW CIVIC ENGAGEMENT ALMOST TO THE POINT OF EXCLUSION

ANGLOPHONE PHILOSOPHERS NEED TO TAKE A LEAF FROM POLITICS AND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LEARN HOW TO BE HIGHLY ENGAGED PUBLIC INTELLECTUALS FOR COMMON FOLK IT IS AN ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY THAT THE MOST POPULAR PHILOSOPHER AS A PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL IS SAM FUCKING HARRIS A MAN WHO MAKES THE LUDICROUS CLAIM THAT HE DOING SCIENCE INSTEAD OF THE ABYSMALLY BAD PHILOSOPHY HE IS ACTUALLY DOING AT LEAST ALAIN DE BATTON IS MAKING A NOBLE EFFORT TO MAKE PHILOSOPHY SLIGHTLY MORE ACCESSIBLE AND RELEVANT ALTHOUGH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE GOOD PHILOSOPHY ACCESSIBLE TO MAJORITY OF WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE
PHILOSOPHY IS GENERALLY USED TO MEAN EUROPEAN ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY IF YOU LOOK AT STEMS LIKE ZEN OR SAMKHYA PHILOSOPHY THE ABSTRACT HAS NEVER BEEN DIVORCED FROM THE PRACTICAL THAT IS THEORY NEVER EXISTS IN A VACUUM IT IS BOUND TO PRACTICE
HAVE YOU HEARD OF A LON EIGHT WAYS TO FAIL TO MAKE LAW IN THIS PIECE FULLER GIVES SEVERAL EXAMPLE OF HOW PHILOSOPHY LOGIC AND COMMON SENSE ARE NECESSARY TO RUN A WHOLE COUNTRY THOUGH THE CHARACTERS AND SETTING ARE FICTITIOUS THE EXAMPLES MAKE THEIR POINT I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A MANDATORY READ FOR EVERY PERSON IN EVERY GOVERNMENT HEAVEN KNOWS THE UNITED STATES NEEDS IT

PHILOSOPHY IS APPLICABLE IN MORE DOMESTIC SETTINGS INCLUDING SCHOOL BUSINESS THE WORKPLACE IN YOUR CHURCH EVEN IN YOUR OWN HOME IT IS SIMPLY A PRACTICED FORM OF REASONING AND CRITICAL THINKING PEOPLE PHILOSOPHIZE EVERY DAY BOTH CORRECTLY AND INCORRECTLY EVERY TIME SOMEONE ENDORSES AYN RAND THEY'RE DOING IT WRONG

IT WOULD BE NICE TO BELIEVE THAT WITH A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF LOGIC AND REASONING THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO READ INTO A SITUATION AND DRAW BETTER CONCLUSIONS BUT SINCE PHILOSOPHY ISN'T TAUGHT IN K IN THE UNITED STATES WE CANNOT ASSUME ITS ACTUAL EFFECTIVENESS BUT THAT'S NOT PHILOSOPHY'S FAULT THAT WOULD BE THE FAULT OF THOSE IN CHARGE AND THOSE WHO ARE IN A POSITION TO CREATE CHANGE FAILING TO DO SO I WOULD SAY YOUR HEADLINE STATEMENT IS ONLY PARTIALLY TRUE BECAUSE PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN TURNED INTO AN EXCLUSIVE PRACTICE IT IS NOT HOWEVER AN INDEFINITE TRUTH
REMOVED
THAT'S PAINTING WITH A BROAD STROKE I DARE SAY THAT ETHICS HAS TREMENDOUS SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE
POINTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN RAISED YET

PRIOR TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY PHILOSOPHERS COULD BE FOUND IN A VARIETY OF OCCUPATIONS SINCE HOWEVER THEY HAVE HAD ONLY ONE HOME THE UNIVERSITY AND WITHIN IT THAT PECULIAR INSTITUTION KNOWN AS THE DEPARTMENT
THIS IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN FOR CENTURIES JUST THINK OF KANT THE MOST IMPORTANT PHILOSOPHER SINCE DESCARTES WHO WAS A PROFESSOR WHILE IT IS ARGUABLY TRUE THAT IN CONTEMPORARY PICK YOUR PREFERRED CONTINENTAL ANALYTIC STRAWMAN PHILOSOPHY THERE IS IN THE ACADEMY THAT'S NOT WHOLLY UNIQUE TO THE CENTURIES

OF THE APPROXIMATELY PHD PROGRAMS IN PHILOSOPHY IN THE UNITED STATES NOT A SINGLE ONE EMPHASISE THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING GRADUATE STUDENTS TO WORK OUTSIDE OF THE ACADEMY
VERY IMPORTANT POINT SOME ARE TRYING TO CHANGE THAT WITHIN PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHY I COULDN'T FIND IT BUT APA OR SOME SHIT PUBLISHED A MONOGRAPH THIS PAST SUMMER ON HOW TO ORIENT PHILOSOPHY GRADUATE PROGRAMS TOWARDS THIS

IT'S FRUSTRATING THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE IMPOSING A VAGUE UTILITARIAN BURDEN ON ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY THAN MOST OTHER INSTITUTIONAL BODIES I'D LOVE FOR MORE PEOPLE TO GET INTO PHILOSOPHY BUT I THINK THESE KINDS OF ARTICLES MAKE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY IRONICALLY DON'T JUSTIFY ALSO FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE PHILOSOPHY IS MORE ACCESSIBLE NOW THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN
REMOVED
THE ARTICLE MAKES A GOOD POINT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WOULDN'T WANT TO SACRIFICE PHILOSOPHICAL RIGOR ON THE ALTAR OF SOCIAL RELEVANCE

MAYBE WHAT WE NEED IS TO PERCEIVE PHILOSOPHY MORE EXPLICITLY AS A CONTINUUM FROM ADVANCED THEORETICAL TOPICS TO PRACTICAL DECISION-MAKING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MATH AND EMPIRICAL SCIENCES LARGELY SEEM TO HAVE ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE WHAT THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS DO AND WHAT ENGINEERS DO WE HAVE WHAT MATHEMATICIANS DO AND WHAT SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS DO WE HAVE WHAT BIOLOGISTS DO IN THE LABORATORY AND WHAT FARMERS AND DOCTORS DO MAYBE WE SHOULD LEARN TO THINK ABOUT WHAT PHILOSOPHERS DO VS WHAT LEGISLATORS DO IN A SIMILAR WAY
IF YOU AGREE WITH THE ARTICLE CONSIDER FUTURE R PHILOSOPHY POSTS TO CLEARLY RELEVANT SUBS MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE ABIDING BY EACH RULES BEFORE POSTING SEE ALSO WHAT IS AND ISN'T APPROPRIATE WHEN IT COMES TO


AND IF IS OK

PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE STUFF R SCIENCE
ANY BIOGRAPHY R HISTORY
ARE WE LIVING IN A SIMULATION ETC R ASKREDDIT

EDIT OR JUST POST THE PHILOSOPHY STUFF TO THE OTHER RELEVANT SUB WITHOUT CROSS POSTING TO R PHILOSOPHY ALSO
THIS THREAT SHOULD BE FUN NOTHING LIKE A ANALYTICAL VS CONTINENTAL BRAWL THE MORE INSIGNIFICANT THE DISCIPLINE THE MORE FERVENT THE INFIGHTING IS A FEEDING FRENZY OVER TINY SCRAPS OF SOCIAL RELEVANCE PHILOSOPHY IS THE PROBABLY THE PINNACLE OF SOCIAL IRRELEVANCE IN AMERICAN LESS THAN OF PEOPLE HAVE ANY PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERSTANDING OF ANYTHING IT IS BY FAR THE LEAST VALUED DISCIPLINE PHILOSOPHY IS NOT SOCIALLY RELEVANT BECAUSE INTELLECTUALISM IS SEEN AS DANGEROUS UNETHICAL AND IMMORAL PHILOSOPHY ITSELF HAS VERY LITTLE BLAME IN THIS THE ACADEMIC WORLD OF PHILOSOPHY IS A SYMPTOM OF ITS IRRELEVANCE NOT A CAUSE
OHH LOOK AT THAT SOMEONE TELLING OTHERS WHAT THEIR RESEARCH INTERESTS SHOULD BE AND DELEGATING THEIR METHODOLOGY FROM OUTSIDE OF IT PHILOSOPHY DOES INFORM POLITICS A BUNCH A WHOLE HELLUVA A LOT ACTUALLY BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THEY ARE DOING PHILOSOPHY WHEN THEY ARE 2 MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT INFORMED ON THE TOPIC THUS AND THOSE WHO ARE MAKING POLICY DECISIONS EVEN IN CORPORATIONS ARE INVOLVED IN LENGTHY MULTIDIMENSIONAL DISCUSSIONS OF CONSIDERATIONS WHICH INCLUDE ETHICS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY ETC WHETHER OR NOT THE PUBLIC IS INFORMED ENOUGH TO BE AWARE THAT THIS ACTUALLY DOES GO ON IN POLITICS AND ECONOMICS AND THESE VARIOUS BRANCHES ARE INFORMED BY INTUITIONS AND STRUCTURED THEORIES THAT INTERPENETRATE WITH SO-CALLED ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY ACTUALLY I'D BE MORE TEMPTED TO SAY THAT ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY IS IMPOSING AN INORGANIC DISCRETE STRUCTURE ON AN AMBIGUOUS INDETERMINATE AND COLLECTION OF DISPARATE APPROACHES TO THINKING

THE IDEA OF IT BEING NEEDED IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE OR ITS ABSENCE BEING A PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY JUST PUBLIC IGNORANCE REVEALING A THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IS GASP PUBLIC IGNORANCE ALSO INSTRUMENTAL EXTRINSIC MOTIVATIONS IN EDUCATION INSTEAD OF SELF-ACTUALIZATION AND SELF-IMPROVEMENT

I DON'T EXPECT IT TO BECOME VERY PREVALENT BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY IT REQUIRES ABOVE AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND AND DECENT FORMAL EDUCATION WHICH GENERALLY RULES OUT MAJORITY PARTICIPATION

AND SOMETIMES IT IS LIKE ASKING THEORETICAL PHYSICS TO BE MORE PRACTICAL

THE THEORETICAL PHYSICIST IS EXPLORING A PROBLEM WITH APPLICATIONS THAT THEY MIGHT ONLY BE ABLE TO SEE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR FIELD AND YOU DON'T
I THINK IT'S JUST THE WAY ITS DELIVERED A LOT OF PHILOSOPHERS TEND TO GET A BIT LONG-WINDED NO BIG DEAL IN MY BOOK BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE THAT MOST PEOPLE DONT HAVE THE ATTENTION SPANS FOR IT SO IT JUST NEEDS TO BE MORE CLEVERLY PACKAGED IN MY OPINION BUT I ENJOY THE SEEMINGLY INCOHERENT STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS STYLE

THAT IS TO SAY IT MAKES SENSE BUT SOMETIMES NOT TO ME BUT THERE IS A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE OUT THERE TO HELP DECIPHER THE CODES LOL
SO SEND MORE TRAFFIC TO PHILOSOPHYTUBE AND WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY THE OPEN SCIENCE PEOPLE ARE SCIENCE COMMUNICATORS MORE THAN THEY ARE SCIENTISTS IN THE ROLE THE ARTICLE ASKS FOR THIS IS A SPECIFIC SKILL AND PEOPLE WE'LL VERSED IN THE ONE COMAS ARE NOT BY NECESSITY ANY GOOD IN THE OTHER PHIL AND VICE VERSA
ONE THING I'VE HEARD SAID BEFORE IS THAT PHILOSOPHY MAKES ITS GREAT DISCOVERIES OVER THE COURSE OF HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF YEARS IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE PROBLEMS AND IDEAS THAT SPAN WAY BEYOND THE CONSIDERATIONS OF A SINGLE LIFE OR EVEN GENERATION

A FEW PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT WHEN PHILOSOPHY MAKES ONE OF ITS GREAT DISCOVERIES IT BECOMES ITS OWN BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE

SCIENCE WAS SUCH A BRANCH ORIGINATING OUT OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY
I'M ALWAYS LATE TO THE GOOD STUFF BECAUSE AUSTRALIA ANYWAY

PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENTS GHETTOIZE IDEAS STEERING PHILOSOPHERS TOWARD PROBLEMS OF INTEREST TO THEIR DISCIPLINARY COLLEAGUES AT THE COST OF PRACTICAL RELEVANCE TO WIDER SOCIETAL CONCERNS EVEN APPLIED PHILOSOPHERS SUFFER FROM A FORM OF DISCIPLINARY CAPTURE

I ALWAYS HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN BLAME IS PLACED ON UNIVERSITIES THE ABOVE QUOTED SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT THIS INTELLECTUAL INCEST ESOTERICISM IS THE FAULT OF UNIVERSITIES BUT THIS WAS AROUND THE SAME TIME ECONOMIC RATIONALISM STARTED TO FLOW THROUGH UNIVERSITIES

WENDY BROWN IN HER BOOK UNDOING THE DEMOS MAKES THE GREAT POINT THAT AS MARKET VALUES STARTED TO BECOME A GOVERNING RATIONALITY IN UNIVERSITIES ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES STARTED TO COUNT IN UNIVERSITIES IN WAYS THAT ENCOURAGED REWARDED AND DEMANDED AND INCREASING SPECIALISATION PUBLICATION OUTPUT IMPACT FACTOR FOR EXAMPLE OF COURSE AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT LIKE THIS WAS IMPOSED ON HELPLESS UNIVERSITIES DEPARTMENTS INDIVIDUALS BUT IT'S NOT VERY PRODUCTIVE I THINK TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THIS HAPPENED IN A VACUUM

IT ALSO MEANS THAT UNIVERSITIES CAN'T SIMPLY FIND IT IN THEMSELVES TO CHANGE THEIR CULTURE BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS SOCIALLY HISTORICALLY POLITICALLY SITUATED
IT INTERESTS ME THAT MOST OF THE RESPONSES AND COMMENTS ADDRESS PHILOSOPHY BUT THE FIRST SENTENCE SAYS SCIENCE IS IN DEEP TROUBLE SHOULDN'T WE ASK WHY SCIENCE HAS BEEN A SUBJECT OF STUDY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR EDUCATIONAL CAREER IT MAKES SENSE THAT PHILOSOPHY MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE IT IS MORE FOREIGN TO US BUT SCIENCE IS LIKE MATH THERE IS ONLY ONE RIGHT ANSWER SO WHAT COMMONALITIES DO PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE SHARE
I THINK WE CAN AGREE SCIENCE CAN INFORM OUR THINKING AND THAT PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES SAY THERE IS NO ESCAPING POLITICS MAYBE IT'S THAT THEY DON'T SHARE ANY COMMONALITIES ARE PHILOSOPHICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ACADEMICS AT WAR IS IT FOR POLITICAL CONTROL OR AGAINST IT
IN ACADEMICS BOTH ARE SEEN AS THE PEOPLE WITH ANSWERS BECAUSE OF THIS THEIR EVIDENCE MUST BE SUPPORTED BY MASS CULTURE THROUGH COMMONLY SHARED EXPERIENCES AND UNDERSTANDING
BUT WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SCIENTIFIC RESULTS OR ETHICAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL VALUES A LACK OF CERTAINTY DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVIDENCE CANNOT BE MARSHALED AND REASONS CANNOT BE GIVEN
GOING BACK TO THE START OF MY THOUGHTS THAT SCIENCE HAS BEEN IN OUR EDUCATION LIVES LONGER THAN PHILOSOPHICAL ACADEMICS PHILOSOPHY'S ACADEMIC EXISTENT IS MUCH LONGER THAN THAT OF SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY STARTS WITH ANYONE FROM THE PAST OR PRESENT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE EVEN IN DIFFERENT MEDIA ERA'S USING A VARIETY OF MEDIUMS PROMOTE NEW IDEAS THAT CAN THREATEN THE PRESENT POLITICAL POWERS AND IDEOLOGY BECAUSE EDUCATION WEALTH AND SOCIAL CLASS WAS A CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION OF SOCIALIZATION BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
PHILOSOPHY'S ORIGINAL PURPOSE BECOMES CONSCIOUS WHEN WE USE IT TO INFORM OUR THINKING IT IS NOT BIASED OR IF IT IS THOSE BIASES DON'T BECOME UNCONSCIOUS AND DOGMATIC VALUES FUNDAMENTALIST DO NOT SET THE STANDARDS OF GOOD LIVING BEAUTY AND WHAT IS JUSTICE A PHILOSOPHERS EXPERTISE SHOULD RELY ON LIBERTIES AND FAIRNESS
PHILOSOPHY IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S INFORMATION OVERLOAD WE PICK AND CHOOSE FROM THE INFORMATION GIVEN TO US BASED OFF EXPERIENCES AND WHAT WE ARE SURROUNDED BY OUR CHOICES ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY EXTEND TO OTHERS BY INFLUENCING THEM TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD OR CHOOSE ANOTHER NO ONE IS CAPABLE OF HOLDING ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE WORLD SO WHO'S TO MAKE RULES OF WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG IN ORDER TO REACH THE FULL POTENTIAL OF HUMAN EXISTENCE AND EXPERIENCE WE MUCH STRIVE TO BE INDIVIDUALS BUT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE OR IS VERY DIFFICULT IF WE CAN'T ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE VALUES PEOPLE WILL HOLD THAT WE WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND ACCEPT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO AND NOT NEED TO BE SEEN AS WRONG OR RIGHT
BUT PHILOSOPHY GOES BEYOND POPULAR MEDIA TEXT ALL MEDIA MEDIUMS THROUGHOUT TECHNOLOGICAL HISTORY AND THE HISTORY OF LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION HAVE VALUE IT CAN EXPOSE REALITY TO CULTURAL OR SOCIAL PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN UNCONSCIOUSLY REMOVED FROM SOCIETY
I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ARTICLE IT MAKES ME WANT TO DO MY MA I OFTEN FIND MYSELF DEFENDING MY SUBJECT CHOICE AT UNI TO A BARRAGE OF CRITICISM THAT IT WAS NOT PRACTICAL USUALLY INCLUDING A JOKE ABOUT WORKING AT MCDONALDS I WOULD ARGUE THAT PHILOSOPHY'S PLACE IS AT THE CENTRE OF PRACTICAL THOUGHT

THINK JURASSIC PARK THEY WERE SO BUSY WONDERING IF THEY COULD THEY NOT STOPPED TO ASK IF THEY SHOULD
THE FRANKFURTER SCHULE IN GERMANY IS DEDICATED TO THE CRITICAL THEORY WHICH IS MEANT TO ANALYZE SOCIAL STRUGGLES AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS I WOULD SAY THAT PART HAS HEAVY SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE
I'M SORRY BUT PHILOSOPHY COMES FROM FRENCH THEN LAYING ALL THE WAY UP TO AINCHENT GREECE WERE THE WORD PHILOSOPHIC MEAN LOVE FOR WISDOM NOW ONE CAN ARGUE THAT PHILOSOPHY AS A EDUCATIONAL MEDIUM IS NOT RELEVANT BUT REALLY PHILOSOPHY SIMPLY MEANS THINKING AND BEING OPEN TO NEW IDEAS I NOW SEE WHY IT'S NOT RELEVANT ANYMORE
FALSE DICHOTOMY PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE RIGOROUS AND OPEN IF OPENING UP PHILOSOPHY ENTAILED REDUCED RIGOUR WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT ANYONE CAN THINK AND WRITE ABOUT POLITICAL SOCIETAL ISSUES THE WHOLE POINT OF PHILOSOPHY I THOUGHT IS TO THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES CLEARLY SO THERE'S A CHANCE WE CAN ACTUALLY GET SOMEWHERE WITH THEM AND I DON'T SEE WHY THOSE KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS HAVE TO BE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
THIS IS A CHICKEN AND EGG SITUATION PHILOSOPHY HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO OFFER LEADERS OF ALL STRIPES SO MUCH OF WHAT IS WRONG WITH AMERICAN POLITICS BUSINESS AND MEDIA FOLLOWS FROM NEGLIGIBLE PHILOSOPHICAL INPUT INTO POLICY FORMATION AND EXECUTIVE DECISION-MAKING IF PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHERS ARE LESS COMMON THAN ART HISTORY EXPERTS IN TERMS OF PRACTICE OF COURSE PHILOSOPHY WILL SKEW TOWARD ACADEMIC APPROACHES THE DISCIPLINE HASN'T BEEN MARGINALIZED BECAUSE OF STRONG THEORETICAL RIGOR THE DISCIPLINE HAS PLACED EXTREME EMPHASIS ON THEORETICAL RIGOR BECAUSE IT HAS LONG BEEN MARGINALIZED
PHILOSOPHERS AKA PHILOSOPHY PROFESSORS LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS ABOUT SOCIETY OR HUMANITY THAT IT IS RELEVANT TO SOCIETY HUMANITY THIS IS CALLED WISHFUL THINKING CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENTS ARE RIFE WITH IDIOTS WHO VIEW THE COMPLEXITY OF A SENTENCE AS EVIDENCE OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF AN AUTHOR OR VALUE COHERENCE OF AN ARGUMENT EXAMPLE TODAY IN MY LEVEL CLASS ON NIETZSCHE I DISCOVERED TO MY ABSOLUTE DISGUST AND HORROR THAT TWO OF THE GRADUATE STUDENTS IN MY CLASS DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANIMALS HAVE EMOTIONS OR EVEN FEEL PLEASURE OR PAIN I ENCOUNTER BRAINDEAD INDIVIDUALS LIKE THIS CONSTANTLY AND THEY ALWAYS WANT TO TELL ME HOW RELEVANT HEGEL IS OR HOW IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO SCIENCE ARE IT'S FUCKING NONSENSE
REMOVED
THE PROBLEM ISN'T A CLOSED PHILOSOPHY THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T ASK PHILOSOPHERS TO HELP THINK THINGS THROUGH ANYMORE THE FINGER IS POINTED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION

PHILOSOPHY IS MORE LIKE BASIC RESEARCH IN SCIENCE THAN APPLIED SCIENCE WE DON'T FUND BASIC RESEARCH ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE SAME IDIOCY DEFINED BY A PROFOUND LACK OF FORESIGHT BOTH BASIC RESEARCH AND PHILOSOPHY OBTAIN THEIR PAYOFF LONG AFTER AND TANGENTIALLY TO THE ORIGINAL INQUIRY
I THINK THE REASON PHILOSOPHY IS CONSIDERED LESS RELEVANT THAN SAY RELIGION IS BECAUSE PHILOSOPHY DOESNT HAVE AS MUCH EMPHASIS ON SYMBOLISM

THE TRUE POWER OF ANY IDEOLOGY WHETHER POLITICAL RELIGIOUS OR PHILOSOPHICAL IS THE POWER OF CONVICTION AND IDENTIFYING THROUGH CHARACTERS OR GODS THAT ACT AS ASPIRATIONS IDEALS OR SIMPLY JUST ASPECTS OR ARCHETYPES OF LIFE
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ THE ARTICLE RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE PHILOSOPHIES SPECIFICALLY FOR SOCIAL RELEVANCE AS THEY WORK TO IMPROVE THE HUMAN CONDITION RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHIES LIKE BUDDHISM IN PARTICULAR TOO
CAN ANYONE NAME ONE INCIDENT IN THE LAST YEARS WHERE PHILOSOPHY ACTUALLY FIXED SOMETHING IN THE REAL WORLD
PRODUCTION VS EVOLUTION ARE WE GROWING AS A SPECIES TO MAKE OURSELVES BETTER OR ARE WE JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE NEXT MOMENT BETTER FOR OURSELVES
IT'S A FAIR CRITIQUE OF ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY AND THE PRIORITY OF THE ANALYTIC PROJECT IN THE ANGLO-AMERICAN ACADEMY BUT CONTINENTAL THINKING IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH SOCIAL ISSUES
DOWNVOTE THE TITLE OF YOUR POST IS VERY MUCH TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT I DON'T AGREE WITH THE ARTICLE ENTIRELY BUT THE ELEMENT YOU MISSED BY NOT FINISHING OR UNDERSTANDING THE MAJORITY OF THE PIECE IS VERY MUCH ARGUABLE THE GENERAL LACK ADOPTION OF VERY ELEMENTARY AND HIGHLY EFFECTUAL PRINCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY AMONGST THE FAMILIAR WESTERN CULTURE IS LARGELY DUE THE ESOTERIC QUALITY OF ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHICAL PURSUITS BY ITS CURATORS

IN THE END THE ARGUMENT ASSUMES A NECESSARY CONCLUSION OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS THAT PROPER PHILOSOPHY IS PARAMOUNT TO ANY ELEMENT OF CULTURE AND A ADOPTION OF PHILOSOPHY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO ITS ACCURACY AND SUFFICIENCY IN ITS FUNCTIONS IN SOCIETY
WHAT A SILLY CLAIM MATHEMATICS DOES THE SAME THING YET IT ENDS UP BEING QUITE RELEVANT SOMETIMES SURPRISINGLY SO
YEP LOT'S OF SNOBS
THAT'S DEEP DUDE
ALSO MOST PEOPLE CAN'T TELL A GOOD ARGUMENT FROM A BAD ONE
I FIND IT FUNNY THAT THEY CLAIM A PREMIUM IS PLACED ON THEORETICAL RIGOR AT THE LOSS OF SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE DO THEY NOT REALIZE THAT THE PRIORITIZING OF SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE IS DERIVED FROM RIGOROUS PHILOSOPHIC ARGUMENT

THAT BEING SAID WHAT I'M GETTING FROM THE ARTICLE IS THAT PHILOSOPHERS IN AN ACADEMIC SETTING SHOULD FOCUS MORE ON PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY THAT CAN BENEFIT THE COMMON MANUAL ISN'T THAT A JOB BETTER SUITED FOR A SOCIOLOGIST PHILOSOPHY WHILE LOGICALLY RIGOROUS IS A VERY SUBJECTIVE AT ANALYZING THE REAL WORLD ABSOLUTE OBJECTIVITY DOESN'T SEEM TO REALLY HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDING OUTSIDE OF RELIGION AND SCIENCE

MY POINT BEING IS THAT MODERN PHILOSOPHY HAS PRETTY MUCH SEPARATED ITSELF FROM THE HISTORICAL ENTANGLEMENTS WITH MATH AND SCIENCE IF IT ABANDONS ITS MORE ACADEMIC MUSINGS WHY WOULD I CHOOSE A PHILOSOPHER OVER A SCIENTIST OR A MATHEMATICIAN
THE OPEN SCIENCE MOVEMENT SEEMS TO BE CALLING FOR MORE COOPERATION BETWEEN SCIENTISTS NOT AN OPENING OF SCIENCE TO THERE IS A REASON THAT SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY BOTH HAVE VERY SPECIFIC JARGON MISINTERPRETATION IS FAR TOO EASY WITHOUT A COMMON LANGUAGE I WOULD AGREE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY AND EXPLAIN SCIENTIFIC AND PHILOSOPHICAL FINDINGS TO THE PUBLIC BUT EXPECTING THE UNTRAINED TO BE CAPABLE OF RUNNING FORWARD WITH THE SCIENTIFIC OR PHILOSOPHICAL BATON IS UNREALISTIC HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL WAY OF INVOLVING THE PUBLIC IN SCIENCE WHILE BENEFITTING FROM MASS DATA COLLECTION BUT I'M NOT SURE IF WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IN AN ANALOGOUS WAY PHILOSOPHY COULD CONTRIBUTE MORE TO SOCIETY IF IT WERE MORE WIDELY TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS BUT WE STILL NEED THE EXPERTS TO DISTILL THEIR RESEARCH INTO AN UNDERSTANDABLE FORMAT AT A CERTAIN POINT WE MUST SIMPLY TRUST THOSE WHO KNOW BETTER THAN WE DO

WE NEED LESS PHILOSOPHY AND MORE ELECTROLYTES THE PLANTS LOVE ELECTROLYTES
THE GUARDIAN SEEKS TO BECOME SOCIALLY RELEVANT BY DISMISSING JOURNALIST RIGOUR AT THE ALTAR OF BECOMING SOCIALLY SIGNIFICANT

MOST RECENTLY I PONDERED UPON SEEING A WELL-WRITTEN ARTICLE ON SYRIA THIS IS GOING TO BE HIDDEN BY ALL OF THE OTHER ARTICLES THAT ARE INCLUDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF POPULARIZING THEIR OWN VIEWS OF WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY

SOMETIMES RIGOUR HAS A PLACE I THINK THAT THE PURSUIT OF SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE IN PHILOSOPHY WHEN IT DOES MINIMIZE RIGOUR BECOMES SOMETHING OTHER THAN PHILOSOPHY NO LESS THAN THE GUARDIAN WHICH HAS BECOME SOMETHING OTHER THAN JOURNALISM
WHAT IS A PHILOSOPHER GOING TO DO

BE

PHILOSOPHERS WERE A BIT MORE RELEVANT PRIOR TO SCIENCE ADVANCING THIS FAR

AS I AGE I'VE FOUND WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY A LOVE OF PHILOSOPHY SLOWLY FADE FOR ME AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THE BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY THAT CAN'T LEAD TO EXPERIMENTS JUST SEEM WORTHLESS SINCE THEY CANNOT BE CONFIRMED ACCURATE

WHEN I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SCIENCE I LIKED PHILOSOPHY MORE BUT AS I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD MORE I BEGAN FINDING LITTLE USE FOR PHILOSOPHY
BEYOND THE MOST BASIC UNDERSTANDINGS OF LOGIC PHILOSOPHY IS PRETTY MUCH WORTHLESS
IN CURRENT TIMES ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY IS MOSTLY WHERE GENUINE PHILOSOPHY GOES TO DIE

THIS ARTICLES ASSUMES THAT PHILOSOPHY IS EITHER ANALYTICAL DRY RIGOUR DOMINANT IN THE UK AND US OR PLATONIC CONTEMPLATING THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL IT SEEMS TOTALLY UNAWARE OF THE VAST CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CONTINENTAL APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PHENOMENA

PHILOSOPHY FOR THE PUBLIC IS CALLED RELIGION BECAUSE THE MASSES ARE NOT INTERESTED AND OR CAPABLE OF THINKING

FURTHERMORE WESTERN PHILOSOPHY HAS FOR MOST OF ITS LIFE BEEN BENT AND TWISTED BY CHRISTIAN DOGMA AND VALUES WITH THE TWO MAJOR EXCEPTIONS PRIOR TO THE CENTURY BEING SPINOZA AND NIETZSCHE

ARE THERE ANY ETERNAL TRUTHS NUMBER
SO IT'S ETERNALLY TRUE THAT THERE ARE NO ETERNAL TRUTHS GOT IT
SHOULD QUESTIONS ALWAYS BE INTERESTING ALSO INTERESTING IS SUBJECTIVE
IT IS SOMEWHAT SCARY THAT SOME ACADEMICS CAN BE PUSHED TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS 2 2 IS NOT AN INTERESTING QUESTION IF 2 2 IS NOT THEN WE CEASE TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT MODERN SCIENCE HOW DO WE MAKE HOUSES CARS SATELLITES MEDICINE HOW DO WE DECIDE ON ECONOMIC POLICY HOW DO WE FUND PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENTS HOW DO WE FEED STANLEY FISH THE CONSEQUENCES ARE ENORMOUS THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION OF EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE WOULD FALL APART INNOVATION WOULD EITHER STOP ENTIRELY OR RESTART IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION ETC ANYONE WHO CARES ABOUT THEIR WAY OF LIFE MUST CARE ABOUT 2 2 BECAUSE THEIR LIFE LITERALLY DEPENDS ON IT

IT IS NOT A SURPRISE TO ME THAT STANLEY FISH HAS A BACKGROUND IN THEORY OF LAW AND LITERARY CRITICISM THESE ARE TWO OF THE DOMAINS WHICH ARE FURTHEST REMOVED FROM INTERACTION WITH THE MATERIAL WORLD LITERARY CRITICISM IN PARTICULAR OFTEN RELIES ON ARGUMENTS THAT ARE DIVORCED FROM EXPERIENCE AND THEREFORE IMMUNE TO EMPIRICAL REFUTATION THIS LACK OF INTERACTION WITH THE WORLD HAS CORRUPTED LARGE SWATHES OF THESE DISCIPLINES WITH EXPERIENCE OUT OF THE PICTURE ANYTHING GOES THE FABRIC OF HUMAN SOCIETIES AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT UNDERLIES IT CAN BE IGNORED

BACK TO STANLEY FISH HIS ANSWER IS THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS TIED TO MEN'S AMBITIONS IF GEOMETRY WAS TO CROSS SOMEONE'S AMBITION IT WOULD COME TO BE DISPUTED JUST LIKE SAY EVOLUTION OR GLOBAL WARMING AND SURE WHAT MATTERS IS MEN'S AMBITION WHAT FISH FAILS TO SEE FROM AN IVORY TOWER OF TENURE BUILT BY PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT 2 2 IS THAT THE AMBITION OF MEN IS NOT LIMITED TO THE ACADEMIC WORLD OF DISCOURSE AMBITION ALSO CONFLICTS WITH EMPIRICAL REALITY WHEN THAT HAPPENS FALSEHOOD HAS CONSEQUENCES EVOLUTION AND GLOBAL WARMING ARE GOOD EXAMPLES

ALSO THE PASSAGE ABOUT WITTGENSTEIN WAS HILARIOUS CLEARLY THE SPEAKER WHO BROUGHT UP W JUST HAD A VERY VAGUE IDEA OF THE CARACTACUS EXISTING AND WANTED TO DO SOME NAME-DROPPING

PS UNSURPRISINGLY HERE'S WHAT FISH BELIEVES ABOUT THE HUMANITIES TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT USE ARE THE HUMANITIES THE ONLY HONEST ANSWER IS NONE WHATSOEVER AND IT IS AN ANSWER THAT BRINGS HONOR TO ITS SUBJECT JUSTIFICATION AFTER ALL CONFERS VALUE ON AN ACTIVITY FROM A PERSPECTIVE OUTSIDE ITS PERFORMANCE AN ACTIVITY THAT CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IS AN ACTIVITY THAT REFUSES TO REGARD ITSELF AS INSTRUMENTAL TO SOME LARGER GOOD THE HUMANITIES ARE THEIR OWN GOOD THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO SAY AND ANYTHING THAT IS SAID DIMINISHES THE OBJECT OF ITS SUPPOSED PRAISE AND FOR GOOD MEASURE HERE'S WHAT A BUNCH OF SMART PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT

I BELIEVE THIS HASN'T BEEN POSTED HERE YET UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS LECTURES IN THE SERIES IF I BROKE SOME RULE I APOLOGIZE

THE REQUIRED READING AND SECTIONS DISCUSSED IN THIS LECTURE ARE THE TRANSCENDENTAL DEDUCTION IN B SECOND EDITION AND THE SCHEMATISM OF THE PURE CONCEPTS OF UNDERSTANDING THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE ANALYTIC OF PRINCIPLES I STRONGLY SUGGEST DOING AT LEAST THIS READING BEFORE DIGGING INTO THE LECTURE IF YOU'VE GOT SOME FORM OF ACCOMPANYING READING SUCH AS OWN BOOK ON THE CRITIQUE THEORY OF MENTAL ACTIVITY OR SEBASTIAN GUIDEBOOK TO THE CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON ALL THE BETTER

IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN KEEPING UP WITH THIS SERIES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND STARTING AT THE FIRST LECTURE THIS IS HARD GOING AND LECTURE IS GOING INTO SOME OF THE MORE DIFFICULT AND ESSENTIAL PASSAGES IN THE ENTIRE BOOK
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO POINT IN LISTENING TO THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THE READING BY THE WAY
THANKS I AM ENJOYING THIS
I JUST FINISHED THE SECOND LECTURE AND I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO CONTINUE THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH TANGENTIAL STORY TELLING SELF AGGRANDIZING AND REMINISCING HAGIOGRAPHY OF NOT ONLY KANT BUT HIMSELF AND GRATUITOUS NAME DROPPING OF FAMOUS PHILOSOPHERS THAT HE'S MET AND INTERACTED WITH FROM HIS DAYS AT HASHHEAD AND NOT ENOUGH CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON

EDIT FOR FEAR OF SOUNDING TOO HARSH HE IS OBVIOUSLY AN EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE PROFESSOR AND AMICABLE LECTURER THIS JUST WASN'T WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF LEARNING ABOUT PHILOSOPHY
DELETED
DELETED
WAS THE MISTAKE THAT THE PRISONER ASSUMED THE JUDGE WAS ACTING PURELY LOGICALLY
MY TAKE ON THIS DILEMMA HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT THE PRISONER EXCLUDED FRIDAY ON THE BASIS I GIVEN I HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED ON MO TUE WE THC I CANNOT BE SURPRISED BY AN EXECUTION ON FRIDAY WHICH SEEMS TRUE HE THEN CONCLUDES II GIVEN THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED ON MO TUE WE AND I I CANNOT BE SURPRISED BY AN EXECUTION ON THURSDAY BUT THIS DOESN'T OBVIOUSLY FOLLOW SINCE HE EXCLUDED FRIDAY ONLY UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT HE WAS NOT EXECUTED ON THURSDAY SO HIS FIRST INDUCTIVE STEP IS MISTAKEN AND HIS ARGUMENT FAILS

IT'S STILL HARD FOR ME TO SHAKE OFF THE INTUITION THAT ON THURSDAY MORNING HE COULD RUN THE ARGUMENT THAT HE CAN'T POSSIBLY BE EXECUTED ON FRIDAY SO THEY MUST COME TODAY AND HE WILL NOT BE SURPRISED BUT I HAVE JUST ACCEPTED THAT MY INTUITION IS JUST WRONG HERE

EDIT THINKING ABOUT THIS MORE THE PARADOX ALSO SUFFERS A BIT FROM COLLOQUIAL MEANINGS OF WORDS SUCH AS SURPRISED AND YOU WILL BE HANGED ON A WEEKDAY IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK FOR A REASONABLE AND UNAMBIGUOUS FORMULATION THE SOLUTION BECOMES OBVIOUS CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING CLAIM OF THE JUDGE THERE EXISTS A RANDOMIZED SELECTION STRATEGY FOR THE DAY OF THE EXECUTION SUCH THAT THERE IS A POSITIVE PROBABILITY FOR SELECTING ANY OF THE WEEKDAYS IN THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND FOR ALL OTHER DAYS AND WHATEVER THE RESULT OF THE SELECTION YOU WILL NEVER BE FULLY JUSTIFIED IN BELIEVING THAT YOU ARE EXECUTED ON ANY GIVEN DAY IN THIS CASE THE JUDGE IS JUST WRONG SUCH A SELECTION STRATEGY CANNOT EXIST SINCE WHENEVER FRIDAY WERE TO BE SELECTED THE PRISONER WOULD KNOW THAT HE WILL BE EXECUTED ON FRIDAY MORNING
AN INTERESTING WAY TO LOOK AT THIS PARADOX IS REDUCING IT TO FEWER AND OR IMPOSSIBLE DAYS

A JUDGE TELLS HIS PRISONER HE WILL BE HANGED YESTERDAY OR TOMORROW AND THAT IT WILL BE A SURPRISE

THE PRISONER CONCLUDES THAT HE CANNOT BE HANGED BECAUSE HE HAS ALREADY LIVED THROUGH YESTERDAY SO THE ONLY DAY HE CAN BE HANGED IS TOMORROW SINCE HE KNOWS THIS IT WILL NOT BE A SURPRISE

TOMORROW ARRIVES AND THE PRISONER IS HANGED HE IS SURPRISED

I BELIEVE THAT THE PARADOX ARISES FROM THE PRISONER'S ASSUMPTION THAT THE SURPRISE PERTAINS ONLY TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH DAY OF THE WEEK THE HANGING WILL OCCUR IN TURN HE BUILDS HIS OWN EXPECTATIONS AND REASONING CONCLUDING THAT HE CANNOT BE HANGED IN THE END THE JUDGE SURPRISES THE PRISONER NOT WITH THE DAY OF THE WEEK HE IS HANGED BUT RATHER BY ACTING COUNTER TO THE PRISONER'S EXPECTATIONS
I ALWAYS FIND THIS ONE DUMB AND NOT A PARADOX AT ALL LITERALLY ANY DAY WILL BE A SURPRISE TO HIM BECAUSE HE HAS RULED THEM ALL OUT AND DOESN'T EXPECT ANY OF THE DAYS
TO BE HONEST I HAVE THOUGHT OF THIS PARADOX IN THE WAY THAT YOU DID MY SOLUTION THAT I CAME UP WITH THAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE THE PARADOX AN ACTUAL SURPRISE WOULD BE EXECUTING THE PRISONER ON A WEEKEND BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED THAT TO HAPPEN SINCE HE RULED OUT S SUN FROM THE DAYS THAT HE WOULD BE EXECUTED YES I KNOW THIS WOULDN'T COUNT AS A PARADOX BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST BE A LIE AND A RUSE

BUT ALSO IM JUST PUTTING MYSELF IN THE PRISONER'S SHOES AND THINKING TO MYSELF THAT EVERYDAY DURING THE WEEKDAY COULD EASILY BE MY LAST DAY
I MEAN IT IS DEFINITELY A CAUSAL LOOP THAT RESULTS IN HIS BEING SURPRISED BY HIS THE HANGING HOWEVER I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT ONCE THE PRISONER RECOGNIZES THE PARADOXICAL NATURE OF THE STATEMENT HE DISCOUNTS IT AS FALSE AND ASSUMES THE EXECUTION WILL NOT OCCUR HOWEVER ALL HE HAS DISPROVEN IS THE VALIDITY OF THE PRECONDITION THAT HE WILL BE SURPRISED IF HE RECOGNIZED THIS HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOUNT FRIDAY AS A POSSIBILITY THUS THE JUDGES STATEMENT HAS THE POTENTIAL OF APPEARING VALID ONCE THE EXECUTION OCCURS BUT REMAINS PARADOXICAL BEFOREHAND

ALSO FOR EVERYONE SAYING THAT HE CAN'T ELIMINATE FRIDAY BECAUSE OF THE CONDITION THAT HE IS EXECUTED ON FRIDAY ONLY IF HE LIVES UNTIL THURSDAY I'M NOT SURE THIS WOULD BE THE CASE AN EXECUTION ON FRIDAY REQUIRES HIS LIVING UNTIL THURSDAY THUS HE CAN ELIMINATE FRIDAY AS AN OPTION AND SO ON THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK I DON'T BELIEVE THIS LINE OF REASONING IS INCORRECT BUT THE CONCLUSIONS THE PRISONER DRAWS FROM IT ARE ARBITRARY
IT'S A PARABLE ON AWARENESS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN NEVER BE SURPRISED IF YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON
NOT V OR MEANS IMPLIES

LETS SAY THAT L IS THE STATEMENT LIVED PAST NOON THAT DAY SO L1 LIVED PAST NOON MONDAY

LET D BE THE SAME AS L BUT WHEN HE DIES SO IS DYING ON MONDAY

LETS DEFINE EXPECTED AS THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE EXECUTION TIMES BEING LET E BE THE BOOLEAN OF EXPECTED

WE ARE TOLD THAT THE DEATH IS EXPECTED SO E IS TRUE

IF YOU CONSIDER MONDAY THEN L1 V V V

SO E IN THIS CASE IS FALSE

HE CONCLUDES IF L4 THIS IS A VALID IF STATEMENT

HE ALSO CONCLUDES L4 BECAUSE IF HE DIES ON FRIDAY HE MUST HAVE BEEN ALIVE THURSDAY AFTERNOON

THIS MAKES E FALSE IF ONLY L4 SO L4 E

HE THEN CONCLUDES E L4 MEANING BECAUSE HIS DEATH MUST BE EXPECTED HE CAN'T LIVE UNTIL THURSDAY AFTERNOON

BY THIS VALID CONCLUSION HE CONCLUDES L3 V L3 V L4

L4 HAS BEEN CONCLUDED FALSE SO L3

LIKEWISE L3 BECAUSE HE NEEDS TO BE ALIVE ON WEDNESDAY TO HAVE DIED THURSDAY

HOWEVER BY CONCLUDING THIS E IS FALSE IF L3 IS TRUE BECAUSE HE NEEDS MORE THAN ONE OPTION ON WEDNESDAY

SO L3 E E L3

L3 L3 THEREFORE

IM GOING TO BE LESS VERBOSE AND USE THE NOTATION A B MEANS A B AND B A

L2

ONLY E

E



L1

ONLY E

E

SUNDAY

ONLY E

E



THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE JUDGE TOLD HIM HE WOULD DIE ONE OF THOSE DAYS SO

V V V V

AND IT WOULD BE NOT EXPECTED SO

E V V V V

HOWEVER WE CONCLUDED

V V V V

SO WE CONCLUDED BOTH



AND



MEANING WE ARRIVED AT A CONTRADICTION

BECAUSE OF THIS CONCLUSION WE CAN SAY THAT

E V V V V E

WE CONCLUDED

SO WE GET

E E

EXPECTED AND NOT EXPECTED OR A PARADOX
WHAT THE REASON THE GUY CANCELS PUT FRIDAY IS BECAUSE ON FRIDAY MORNING HE WOULD KNOW HE WOULD HAVE TO DIE THAT DAY IE ON THURSDAY NIGHT HE WOULD KNOW IN ADVANCE HENCE HE WOULDN'T BE EXECUTED IN THE ACTUAL PARADOX HE CAN'T BE EXECUTED ON THE FRIDAY BUT YOU CAN'T RELY ON A FALSEHOOD AS THE BASIS FOR YOUR LOGIC SO THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO THURSDAY ETC
NOT TO MENTION THAT AS SOON AS THE PRISONER RULED OUT FRIDAY HE COULD HAVE BEEN EXECUTED FRIDAY AND IT BE UNEXPECTED BECAUSE HE EXPECTED THAT DAY TO BE RULED OUT
THE PROBLEM IS THAT ONE CANNOT USE REASONING TO REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE WILL BE SURPRISED BECAUSE BEING SURPRISED MEANS NOT HAVING KNOWLEDGE OF SOMETHING WHICH IS THE EXACT THING REASONING SEEKS OUT TO DO
I WOULD SAY THE PRISONER'S MISTAKE LIES IN NOT TAKING HIS REASONING FAR ENOUGH TO SEE ITS CIRCULARITY

CONSIDERING FRIDAY HE THINKS I CAN'T BE EXECUTED ON FRIDAY BECAUSE IT'S THE LAST POSSIBLE DAY THAT MEANS I'LL BE EXPECTING IT SO I WON'T BE SURPRISED BUT ONCE HE RULES FRIDAY OUT HE LEAVES HIMSELF OPEN TO BEING SURPRISED ABOUT IT

EXECUTION ON FRIDAY IS IMPOSSIBLE IF HE BELIEVES THAT IT'S POSSIBLE HOWEVER AS SOON AS HE BELIEVES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IT BECOMES POSSIBLE
IT APPEARS THE PROBLEM LIES WITHIN THE WORD SURPRISE WHICH IS DEFINED AS AN UNEXPECTED EVENT IN OTHER WORDS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN THE JUDGE STATED THAT THE EXECUTION WILL HAPPEN DURING THE NEXT WEEK THUS IT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN BUT HE ALSO SAID THE PRISONER WILL BE SURPRISED WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE SINCE HE CAN EXPECT THE EXECUTION DURING THE WEEK TRUE IT IS NOT KNOWN EXACTLY ON WHICH DAY IT WILL HAPPEN BUT IT IS STILL EXPECTED THUS THE JUDGE MUST HAVE LIED ABOUT SOMETHING
THE PRISONER CONCLUDED THAT HE LIED ABOUT THE EXECUTION BUT FAILED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE LIED ABOUT THE SURPRISEMENT NOW THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER HE ALSO LIED ABOUT THE EXECUTION BUT NEITHER OUTCOME WILL BE SURPRISING

IN CONCLUSION THE PRISONERS LOGIC WAS CORRECT ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE EXECUTION BEING SURPRISING BUT HE FAILED TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE JUDGE MIGHT HAVE LIED ABOUT THE SURPRISEMENT PART NOT THE EXECUTION PART
I DON'T SEE A PARADOX IN THE FIRST PLACE THE JUDGE TELLS HIM IT WILL BE A SURPRISE HE CAN'T KNOW IT WILL BE A SURPRISE HE JUST SAID IT WILL BE AND IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE IT TURNED OUT THAT THE PRISONER USED SOME OTHER LOGIC AND DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD BE EXECUTED WEDNESDAY IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AND THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG THE PRISONER'S MISTAKE IS ASSUMING THAT WHAT THE JUDGE SAID HAS TO END UP BEING TRUE
DUMBEST PHILOSOPHY PROBLEM EVER HE'S HUNG ON FRIDAY AS THAT IS INDEED THE SURPRISE
I'M NOT SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT A PARADOX IS
WHO CONTROLS THESE OBJECTS

DAY OF HANGING THE JUDGE CONTROLS THIS ONLY THE JUDGE KNOWS THIS

2 FEELING OF SURPRISE THE PRISONER CONTROLS THIS THE PRISONER KNOWS THAT EACH DAY IS A HANGING DATE AND SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED

AS SUCH THE JUDGE IS WRONG BECAUSE HE CANNOT OWN THE FEELING OF SURPRISE WHILE HANGING CAN IN FACT CAUSE SURPRISE THAT IS NOT A NECESSITY

SINCE THERE IS A MISUNDERSTANDING IN WHO ACTUALLY OWNS EACH OF THESE ACTIONS SEEMINGLY GOOD LOGIC CAN BE FALSE THE PRISONERS ASSUMPTION THAT HE CONTROLS THE ACTION OF HANGING IS FALSE THE SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTORY PROBLEM STEMS FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EXPLOSION OR FROM FALSEHOOD ANYTHING

SO AGAIN SURPRISE DOES NOT IMPLY HANGING AND HANGING DOES NOT IMPLY SURPRISE

I POSTED ABOUT THE FLAW IN THE PRISONERS LOGIC HERE
WHY IS THIS SUB A DEFAULT
HERE'S WHAT I THINK THE PRISONER DONE TO SURVIVE

EVERY DAY HE COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT TODAY IS THE DAY HE IS GOING TO DIE AND CONFIRM THIS WITH THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM CELL MATES NEIGHBOURING CELLS JAIL GUARDS

BECAUSE IF EACH DAY IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE KNEW TODAY WOULD BE HIS LAST THEY WOULD NOT SEND THE EXECUTIONER TO HIM BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED
ONCE FRIDAY'S NOON CAME TO PASS THEN AND ONLY THEN WOULD HE BE SAFE
I BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY WAY HE COULD SURVIVE THE WEEK

BUT THE REASON HE DIDN'T WAS BECAUSE HE FORGOT THAT THERE WAS STILL THE CAUSE AND EFFECT IN HIS LOGIC THE PAST WHERE HE WILL ONLY SURVIVE IF SAID SPECIFIC THING HAPPENS IN A WAY EACH DAY HE WOULD BE WORKING FRONT WAY INSTEAD OF BACKWARDS HE SAID MONDAY IS THE DAY I DIE THEN WHEN MONDAY PASSES SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT TUESDAY AND SO ON

WHAT DO YOU THINK I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S FAULT IN MY LOGIC OR IF THIS IS EVEN AN ANSWER OR IF THIS LOGIC IS INCONSEQUENTIAL
I THINK THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PARADOX IS JUST WRONG YOU JUST CAN'T SAY THAT MORE THAN ONE CHOICE IS NOT A SURPRISE YOU CAN TAKE A RANDOM DAY AND DETERMINE IT'S THE ONE DAY YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED IF IT HAPPENS BUT AS SOON AS YOU TAKE A SECOND ONE THE FIRST ONE WILL BE A SURPRISE AGAIN

LET ME PUT IT INTO A DIFFERENT EXAMPLE IF I SAY YOU CAN SAY ANY RANDOM NUMBER AND I WON'T BE SURPRISED BY THE ONE YOU CHOOSE I CAN SAY TO MYSELF THAT WON'T SURPRISE ME BUT IF I SAY AND WON'T SURPRISE ME IT LOST IT'S MEANING I CAN'T JUST DETERMINE THE NUMBERS INFINITY WON'T SURPRISE ME THAT WOULD KILL THE WHOLE POINT OF SURPRISE EXPECTING THE OUTCOME WOULDN'T IT I THINK THE WHOLE DEFINITION OF SURPRISE IS UNFITTING FOR THIS PARADOX

THIS IS JUST SOME RAMBLING WHILE I'M TIRED SO EXCUSE ME IF I MISSED THE POINT MYSELF

EDIT BTW IT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY WORKED IF HE CHANGES HIS OPINION HE CAN ALWAYS THINK OF THE NEXT DAY AS THE ONE HE'S GETTING HANGED THAT WAY HE WOULDN'T EVER BE SURPRISED BY THE HANGING BUT ACTUALLY BY SURVIVING A DAY WHICH SHOULD BE ALLOWED

EDIT 2 IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY IF HE EXPECTS NOT TO BE KILLED BY THINKING HE WILL BE KILLED THAT'S THE REAL PARADOX IF YOU ASK ME
IF HE WAS NOT HUNG ON THURSDAY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRIZED IT WAS GOING TO BE FRIDAY HIS LOGIC IS NARROW
THE PRISONER NOT EXPECTING THE HANGING ON FRIDAY MAKES SENSE WHEN APPLYING THE RULES OF THIS PARADOX

HE WILL NOT KNOW THE DAY OF THE HANGING UNTIL THE EXECUTIONER KNOCKS ON HIS CELL DOOR AT NOON THAT DAY

THE REASON THE PRISONER DOESN'T THINK THE HANGING WOULD HAPPEN ON FRIDAY IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE FINAL NOON OF THAT WEEK WITH THAT SAID THOUGH THE PRISONER WOULD STILL BE SURPRISED ABOUT THE FRIDAY HANGING WHEN NOON PASSES THE THURSDAY BEFORE ALTHOUGH THAT LOGIC DOESN'T FOLLOW THE PARADOX RULE OF UNTIL THE EXECUTIONER KNOCKS ON HIS CELL DOOR AT NOON THAT DAY BUT WITH THAT SAID HE WOULD STILL BE SURPRISED ABOUT THE FRIDAY HANGING JUST NOT WHEN THE EXECUTIONER KNOCKS WHICH I REALIZE BREAKS THE PARADOX BUT IT ALSO REVEALS TO FAULTY LOGIC OF THIS PARADOX THE FAULTY LOGIC BEING THE FINAL DAY COULD BE A SATURDAY OR TUESDAY REALLY ANY DAY INEVITABLY FALLS FOR THE EXECUTIONER KNOCKING AT NOON RULE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE FINAL DAY WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE THE FINAL POSSIBILITY FOR THE EXECUTIONER KNOCKING AT NOON AND THEREFORE WOULD BE FORESEEN

MY POINT BEING IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PRISONERS LOGIC IT'S ABOUT THE CONFINES OF THE PARADOX

THE PRISONER'S FALLACY WAS IN NOT EXPECTING TO BE HANGED THE PRISONER RULES OUT FRIDAY BY THINKING INCORRECTLY THAT HE CANNOT BE HANGED FRIDAY BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD NOT BE UNEXPECTED INSTEAD HE SHOULD HAVE ONLY EXPECTED TO NOT BE SURPRISED NOW WHICHEVER DAY HE IS HANGED BECOMES UNEXPECTED BECAUSE HIS OWN FAULTY LOGIC THAT HE CANNOT BE HANGED BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IOW HE PLAYED HIMSELF
FOR THOSE CONFUSED ON HOW THIS IS A PARADOX I PUT THIS COMMENT BELOW BUT ILL POST IT HERE AND HOPE IT MAKES ITS WAY TO THE TOP

IF HE BELIEVES HE CAN STILL BE HUNG THEN HE CANT BECAUSE HE IS EXPECTING IT AND IF HE BELIEVES HE CANT BE HUNG THEN HE CAN BECAUSE HE ISNT EXPECTING IT AND IT JUST KEEPS LOOPING

THATS WHERE THE PRISONERS LOGIC IS WRONG AND THATS WHY THE STORY ENDS WITH HIM BEING HUNG THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE LOGIC OF HIM RULING OUT THE DAYS BECAUSE IT WORKS BUT THEN HE SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT SOON AS HE STOPS EXPECTING TO BE EXECUTED HE CAN BE SURPRISED WHICH SHOULD BRING HIM BACK TO EXPECTING TO BE HUNG WHICH WOULD LEADING HIM BACK TO NOT EXPECTING IT AND SO ON
ASSUMPTION I CAN'T BE HANGED ON FRIDAY IMPLIES I WASN'T HANGED BEFORE FRIDAY THIS HIDDEN ASSUMPTION IS THE PROBLEM
THE SIMPLE SOLUTION IS THAT THE PRISONER KNOWS THERE'S NO LOGICAL SOLUTION AND THE JUDGE IS CRAZY AND THEREFORE ANY DAY EXCEPT FOR THE LAST IS AN UNEXPECTED SURPRISE BAM WHERE'S MY GILD

SORRY I'LL RETURN TO MY ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS NOW
DELETED
PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO STOP SAYING THAT THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION IMPLIES THAT CONSCIOUSNESS CAUSES WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE
I FIND THE IDEA OF QUANTUM IMMORTALITY OR THE DOOMSDAY DEVICE SCENARIO COMPELLING BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS ALWAYS ONE BIG LEAP IN THE ARGUMENT FOR WHY IT SHOULD WORK

ACCORDING TO THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION THERE ARE CURRENTLY BILLIONS OF COPIES OF ME LIVING THEIR LIVES IN ALTERNATE UNIVERSES HOWEVER I ONLY CONSCIOUSLY EXPERIENCE ONE OF THESE UNIVERSES MY DOPPELGANGER EXPERIENCES ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE FOR ME

AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE QUANTUM IMMORTALITY SCENARIO POSITS THAT I ALWAYS CONSCIOUSLY EXPERIENCE A UNIVERSE IN WHICH I AM ALIVE BUT WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE THE CASE MAYBE I PULL TRIGGER OF THE GUN AND I DIE THAT IS MY CONSCIOUSNESS STOPS IN A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE A COPY OF ME WILL SURVIVE BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT MY PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE OR CONSCIOUSNESS SWITCHES TO THIS ALTERNATE UNIVERSE

I MEAN IF I GO TO SLEEP AND MY CONSCIOUSNESS FADES IT'S NOT THAT I AUTOMATICALLY EXPERIENCE MYSELF IN A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE IN WHICH I AM NOT ASLEEP RIGHT IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE QUANTUM IMMORTALITY ARGUMENT SHOULDN'T I ALWAYS BE AWAKE AND NEVER GO TO SLEEP AT ALL

HOWEVER MAYBE I AM MISSING SOMETHING IN THE ARGUMENT AS I'M NEITHER TRAINED IN PHILOSOPHY OF MIND OR QUANTUM PHYSICS

THE INTERPRETATION PRESENTS A MORE ELEGANT ALTERNATIVE TO THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION IN TERMS OF ITS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ASSERT A RELATION BETWEEN OBSERVER S CONSCIOUSNESS AND REALITY

I AM NO EXPERT BUT I AM PRETTY SURE THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION DOESN'T DO THAT EITHER AND THE AUTHOR FUNDAMENTALLY MISUNDERSTOOD IT IN A WAY MANY PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC MISREPRESENTATIONS OF QUANTUM PHYSICS DO

THE FACT THAT AN OBSERVER COLLAPSES THE WAVE FUNCTION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CONSCIOUSNESS IT CAN BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS SOME APPARATUS WHICH FORCES THE OBSERVED OBJECT INTO A CERTAIN STATE BY HEAT BATHING IT WITH ITS OWN WAVEFUNCTION

SOMEONE WITH A DEGREE IN PHYSICS FEEL FREE TO CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG ON THIS
ALRIGHT GUYS I'M AF HOOKING MYSELF UP TO A MACHINE THAT WILL KILL ME IF I DO NOT WIN THE LOTTERY I'LL BE RICH WHEN I WAKE UP AND I'LL KNOW THAT THE THEORY WAS TRUE

FURTHERMORE THE IDEA OF ORBITING A BLACK HOLE AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE IN THE DARK ALL BY MY LONESOME SOUNDS KIND OF ELEGANT IN A WAY
THIS ARTICLE MAKES THE TRADITIONAL MISTAKE OF ASSUMING THAT WAVEFUNCTION COLLAPSE IS AN EXPERIMENTALLY PROVEN PHENOMENON WE DON'T KNOW IF WAVEFUNCTION COLLAPSE ACTUALLY HAPPENS OR IF IT ONLY APPEARS TO HAPPEN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EXCELLENT THEORIES INCLUDING MY FAVORITE EINSELECTION WHICH DOES AWAY WITH COLLAPSE AND INSTEAD SUGGEST WAYS THAT'S THE APPEARANCE OF COLLAPSE MIGHT BE AN EMERGENT BEHAVIOR OF THE HAMILTONIAN THROUGH SUPERSELECTION RULES

IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PART OF THE REASON WE NEED THESE SEEMINGLY COMPLICATED THEORIES IS THE FACT THAT ENTANGLEMENT EXISTS AND THAT BELL'S EXPERIMENTS PROVE THAT ANY HIDDEN VARIABLE THEORY IS INSUFFICIENT TO REPRODUCE THE PREDICTIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER MEAN THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME UNINTUITIVE WEIRDNESS GOING ON
AS MUCH AS IT'D BE NICE TO BELIEVE HERE'S THE BIGGEST ISSUE I SEE WITH QUANTUM IMMORTALITY

IT SEEMS TO TREAT CONSCIOUSNESS AS AN ON OR OFF STATE EITHER SOMEONE IS AND FULLY AWARE OR DOESN'T EXIST AT ALL BUT WE KNOW THIS TO NOT BE THE CASE WE KNOW THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS BETTER DESCRIBED AS A GRADIENT AND THAT THE LOWER STATES OF THAT LOOK VERY MUCH BUT NOT EXACTLY LIKE NOT BEING CONSCIOUS AT ALL TAKE SENSORY DEPRIVATION EXPERIMENTS A PERSON PUT IN A PADDED CELL WITH NO LIGHT OR SOUND WILL EVENTUALLY LOSE THEIR CONCEPT OF TIME AND OF THEMSELVES COMMONLY THEY CEASE TO BELIEVE THEY EXIST AT ALL THIS ISN'T AN TRANSITION IT HAPPENS SLOWLY OVER TIME WITH THE SUBJECT BECOMING LESS AND LESS AWARE CONSCIOUS OVER TIME

AND WHAT ABOUT FOLKS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS LIKE IS THERE SUPPOSED TO BE A POINT WHERE THEY ARE CONSIDERED DEAD EVEN THOUGH ALIVE AND JUST VERY SLIGHTLY BARELY AWARE AND THEIR CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE IS NO LONGER RELEVANT IN THAT UNIVERSE THAT WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE THE ALTERNATIVE SEEMS TO BE THAT THEIR CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE IN ONE MULTIVERSE SURVIVES FOREVER IN THIS AND STATE

TAKING THIS A STEP FURTHER QI THEN SEEMS TO ALLOW FOR A SPECIAL KIND OF TORMENTING HELL A BRAIN IN A JAR WITH NO SENSORY INPUT THOUGH PERHAPS CONSTANT EXTREME PAIN SOMEHOW CONSCIOUS BUT FLOATING THROUGH BLACK EMPTY SPACE FOR ALL ETERNITY WHILE THE ENTIRE REST OF THE UNIVERSE IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED IF A MULTIVERSE EXISTS WHERE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE MUST CONTINUE FOREVER EVEN IN STATES ONE MUST ALLOW FOR THIS POSSIBILITY INDEED IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE THE LIKELY OUTCOME FOR EVERY SINGLE CONSCIOUSNESS EACH IN THEIR OWN MULTIVERSE IF A MULTIVERSE ALWAYS SPLITS AND ALLOWS A CONSCIOUSNESS TO CONTINUE EXISTING EVEN BEYOND THE PHYSICAL END OF THE UNIVERSE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DEATH IS LIKE BUT THIS SCENARIO SOUNDS FAR FAR WORSE THAN IT
THE THEORY CLAIMS THAT OBSERVING REALITY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES IT SEVERAL ADDITIONAL INTERPRETATIONS ARE SIMILAR TO THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION IN THAT THEY ALSO CREATE A LINK BETWEEN CONSCIOUSNESS AND REALITY

THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE AUTHOR MISUNDERSTANDS WHAT IS MEANT BY OBSERVING OBSERVING IS INTERACTION WITH THE SYSTEM TO GET INFORMATION OUT OF IT SUCH AS FIRING A PARTICLE IN TO IT IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH CONSCIOUSNESS THE QUANTUM STATE STILL COLLAPSES WHEN A PARTICLE HITS IT REGARDLESS OF HUMAN INVOLVEMENT
THE QUANTUM SUICIDE EXPLANATION IS BAFFLING TO ME IF I CURRENTLY LIVING IN THIS UNIVERSE UNDERGO THE TEST AND AM SHOT IN THE HEAD AND DIE WHY WOULD I SUDDENLY BE TRANSPORTED TO AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE I AM NOT SHOT WHY IS THERE A CERTAINTY THAT I CANNOT BE KILLED IN THIS EXPERIMENT IN THE MULTIPLE WORLDS THEORY I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME VERSIONS OF ME WILL SURVIVE TECHNICALLY AN INFINITE NUMBER BUT I AM NOT THEM AND THEY ARE NOT ME BECAUSE WE RESIDE IN DIFFERENT UNIVERSES
ISN'T A MAJOR FLAW IN THIS THE LINKING OF LARGE MACRO EVENTS TO TINY QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS THE DOOMSDAY DEVICE AND IMMORTALITY BOTH JUST ASSUME THAT A QUANTUM CHANGE WILL BE ENOUGH TO CHANGE OUR SITUATION ENOUGH TO AVOID DEATH OR STOP A NUCLEAR ATTACK BUT ACTUALLY THAT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY THROW MYSELF INTO A FIRE AND WHAT SUBATOMIC CHANGE IS GOING TO SAVE ME LIKE MANY ARTICLES IT MISUNDERSTANDS QUANTUM UNCERTAINTY IN A SUBATOMIC PARTICLE WITH ANY HUMAN ACTION OR DECISION IS POSSIBLE
DESPITE WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT NOT EXPERIENCING THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF OTHER SELVES I FOUND THIS VERY INTRIGUING DOES THIS MEAN THAT THERE EXISTS A UNIVERSE WHERE NO ONE DIES
YOU MUST CHOOSE WHAT YOU DEFINE AS YOU CHOOSE CAREFULLY BECAUSE IF YOU DEFINE ALL FUTURE CONTIGUOUS PATHS FROM YOUR PRESENT AWARENESS AS BEING YOU THEN YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED TO EXPERIENCE THE MOST HORRIBLE THING THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO YOU IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE

FOR MENTAL WELL-BEING I RECOMMEND DEFINING YOU TO INCLUDE BOTH YOUR FUTURE PATH AS WELL AS YOUR PAST ONE YOU LOSE QUANTUM IMMORTALITY BUT AT LEAST YOU ONLY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ORDINARILY PROBABLE THINGS HAPPENING TO YOU OR RESTATED IT'S ONLY ORDINARILY PROBABLY THAT THE YOU THAT YOU ARE IS THE ONE WHO HAS SOMETHING EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE ON THEIR FUTURE PATHOLOGY
AN ACQUAINTANCE DIED IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT IF HE'S NOT REALLY DEAD WE ARE PERCEIVING HIM AS DEAD HERE BUT IN AN ALTERNATE REALITY HE IS NOT DEAD HE MADE IT OUT OF THAT CAR AND HE IS ALIVE IT THREW MY FRIENDS FOR A LOOP AND I PROPOSED THIS IDEA TO MY BF AS WELL TO WHICH HE PERSONALLY FOUND TO BE A NICE IDEA OF THOUGHT AS HIS YOUNGER BROTHER DIED AT HE WENT FROM IDENTIFYING AS A FOLLOWER OF CHRIST TO BELIEVING IN THE MULTIVERSE AS WELL AS HE IS MATHEMATICALLY INCLINED

FOR MY OWN PART I HAVE BEEN DECLARED DEAD TIMES YET HERE I AM IN THIS REALITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE WONDERING I HAD OPEN HEART SURGERY AT AND DIED TWICE BEFORE AND DURING SURGERY WHICH IS CRAZY FREAKY

YET HERE I AM

SO WOULD IT NOT BE THAT PERHAPS WE ALL EXPERIENCE OUR OWN LIVES TO BE LIVED TO THE FULLEST AND DIE OF NATURAL CAUSES OR OLD AGE IN SOME CASES BUT WE WOULD BE THE ONLY ONES WHO WOULD KNOW

I EAST IN THE SCENARIOS IN WHICH I DIED FOUR TIMES I DIED FOUR TIMES FOR REAL AND IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE MY PARENTS ARE WHO KNOWS WHAT AND LIVING WITH THE THOUGHT THAT I AM DEAD BUT IN THIS UNIVERSE THEY ARE HERE TO EXPERIENCE ME BEING ALIVE

ON ANOTHER NOTE WHEN I WAS ADDICTED TO DRUGS I TOOK A COMBO THAT SHOULD HAVE KILLED ME IT WOULD HAVE KILLED ANYBODY ELSE YET HERE I AM I NEVER EVEN WENT TO THE ER OR ANYTHING I JUST RODE IT OUT

I ALSO KNEW A PERSON WHO ALSO LIKE ME TOOK A COCKTAIL OF CRAZY AND SOMEHOW LIVED AND THE CRAZIEST PART WAS THAT THIS PERSON HAD A HEART TRANSPLANT AT YEARS OLD

TO ME I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE NOT DEAD UNTIL WE DIE OF OLD AGE BUT WE MIGHT BE PERCEIVED DEAD IN SOME REALITY BUT STILL ALIVE IN ANOTHER

HOWEVER THE QUANTUM IMMORTALITY IS SOMETHING I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF AND IT IS INCREDIBLY INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT IF IT IS THE CASE THEN I SHALL LIVE FOREVER SOMEHOW IN SOME MANNER BUT BE PERCEIVED DEAD BY ALL OTHERS THAT IS P COOL

IS QUANTUM INDETERMINISM WHY THEY SAY THAT WE MIGHT BE IN A SIMULATION IF IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THEN IT DOES SOUND LIKE THE UNIVERSE IS SOME SORT OF A GENETIC ALGORITHM SIMULATION TESTING OUT ALL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES TO PERHAPS FIND A SUITABLE ONE
IS THE UNIVERSE'S A B TESTING
IF THE EQUATION SHOWS THAT THERE ARE TWO POSSIBILITIES THEN WHY NOT ASSUME THAT THERE ARE TWO POSSIBILITIES

BECAUSE EQUATIONS ARE ABSTRACTIONS NOT REALITY EVEN IN CASES WHERE MATH DIRECTLY PREDICTS OUTCOMES OUTSIDE OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO CONFUSE IT WITH REALITY ITSELF THIS IS THE BIGGEST FAILING OF THE HUMAN MIND WE WRITE DOWN EQUATIONS AND DECIDE THAT THEY MUST THEN SOMEHOW REPRESENT SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL REALITY JUST BECAUSE IF I WRITE AN ALGORITHM ON A COMPUTER THAT ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE OUTCOMES TO A GIVEN MEASUREMENT DOES THAT MEAN THEY ALL EXIST INSIDE THE COMPUTER SOMEWHERE NUMBER THIS IS A ANALOGY THERE IS NO ANALOGY OR EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE OF EVEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT MORE THAN ONE OUTCOME EXISTS AT ANY GIVEN MEASUREMENT INSTANCE THERE IS ONLY A MISGUIDED PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE ABSTRACT PHENOMENA KNOWN AS A SUPERPOSITION ONLY ONE OUTCOME IS EVER OBSERVABLE AND ALL OTHER OUTCOMES DO NOT EXIST OUT THERE SOMEWHERE IN IMAGINARY UNIVERSES

ADDITIONALLY OWI CLAIMS TO REMOVE THE CONSCIOUS OBSERVER FROM QM WHEN IN FACT ONE OF THE TENETS IS THAT SOMEHOW A CONSCIOUS OBSERVER MAGICALLY BECOMES INEXTRICABLY ENTANGLED WITH THE EXPERIMENT AND THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULT SOMEHOW JUST BY MAKING A MEASUREMENT THIS SEEMS TO ME A DIRECT REFERENCE TO CONSCIOUSNESS BEING RELATED OR LINKED TO MEASUREMENT SOMEHOW IN FACT OWI IMPLIES MANY THINGS FOR CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF INCLUDING A SPLITTING OF CONSCIOUSNESS INTO MULTIPLE BRANCHES OF REALITY IT SEEMS CONSCIOUSNESS CANNOT BE REMOVED FROM OWI AFTER ALL A PROBLEM FOR ANY THEORY BECAUSE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS AROUND SO THE PROBLEM OF WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING BEFORE MEASUREMENT I EAST THE CONSCIOUS OBSERVER BECOMES ENTANGLED WITH THE MEASUREMENT DEVICE FORCING ONE BRANCH OF THE TREE TO ACTUALIZE BECOMES RATHER LARGE ALL IN ALL IT SEEMS THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION HAS MUCH TO SAY ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS

FINALLY THERE IS THE DIFFICULTY OF EXPLAINING DELAYED CHOICE EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH THE RESULT AT A DETECTOR MAY BE DECIDED LONG AFTER A PARTICLE STRIKES IT UNDER OWI WHEN A PARTICLE STRIKES A DETECTOR THAT RESULT IS SET IN STONE AND ALSO BREAKS ENTANGLEMENT THEREFORE IT SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON THE LATER MEASUREMENT

OWI IS UNTENABLE
I TRIED TO COMMIT QUANTUM SUICIDE AFTER READING THIS MY HEAD HURTS
DOESN'T WORK THOUGH YOU'RE ALREADY IN WHATEVER UNIVERSE YOU'RE IN IF THIS IS THE UNIVERSE WHERE YOU DIE TOMORROW THEN YOU'RE SCREWED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE'S ANOTHER WHERE YOU LIVE YOU DON'T MIRACULOUSLY BECOME YOUR COUNTERPART IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE AT THE MOMENT YOU WOULD HAVE DIED
IS THE MANY WORLDS HYPOTHESIS INCONSISTENT WITH EFFECTIVE QUANTUM COMPUTERS IT SEEMS THAT QUANTUM COMPUTING OPERATES ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT PARTICLES ARE IN ALL STATES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND IT SIFTS BETWEEN ALL OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME IF WE'RE ACTUALLY ONLY IN ONE STATE THEN WOULDN'T QUANTUM COMPUTERS JUST SPIT OUT UTTERLY RANDOM GIBBERISH EVERY TIME THEY OPERATE
IS THE ARTICLE IMPLYING THAT YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF AN ALTERNATE YOU ARE THE SAME

THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE QUANTUM IMMORALITY THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS THAT IT SEEMS TO ABUSE LANGUAGE FAVORING SALIENCE OVER CLARITY FOR EXAMPLE THE ARTICLE IS STATING THAT THERE BE AN ALTERNATE REALITY IN WHICH YOU SURVIVE HOWEVER MANY BRUSHES WITH DEATH IT FURTHER STATES THAT SURVIVING NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE ODDS SOMEHOW PROVES THAT THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY UNIVERSES WHAT'S BEING OBSCURED IS THAT THESE ALTERNATE REALITIES ONLY EXIST FURTHERMORE AS THE ODDS AGAINST YOU APPROACH INFINITY IT'S MUCH MORE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THEY EXIST
WHICH WINS QUANTUM IMMORTALITY OR ENTROPY
SORT OF AN IDEA ALONG THESE LINES

SO SAY YOU ARE ALIVE LIVE YOUR LIFE AND DIE IN THE COMPLETELY TYPICAL PREDICTABLE FASHION INFINITE UNIVERSES WHERE EVERY POSSIBLE REALITY HAPPENS GUARANTEES THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A UNIVERSE WHERE AN EXACT COPY OF YOU AT THE MOMENT OF YOUR DEATH WAKES UP AND CONTINUES LIVING

MAYBE THEY'RE ON SOME OTHER PLANET OR SOMETHING
MOVIE SCRIPT IDEA

TWISTED SERIAL KILLER LEARNS ABOUT QUANTUM SUICIDE THEORY NOT BELIEVING IN IT HIMSELF BUT USING THE IN HIS MIND RIDICULOUS IDEA TO BRAINWASH VICTIMS INTO BELIEVING IN IT THIS WAY HE IS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY KILL VARIOUS PEOPLE HOWEVER LITTLE DOES HE KNOW THIS THEORY ISN'T IN FACT CRAZY BUT INSTEAD THE PEOPLE THAT HE HAD KILLED IN HIS UNIVERSE CONTINUE TO LIVE IN OTHER UNIVERSES THESE PEOPLE THEN CONVINCE OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY HEARD THE TEN CLICKS AND BECOME SERIAL KILLERS THEMSELVES THINKING IT'S MORALLY OKAY BECAUSE THE PERSON DOESN'T ACTUALLY DIE THIS EVENTUALLY CREATES AN INFINITE NUMBER OF MURDERS SUICIDES THROUGHOUT INFINITE UNIVERSES

KARMA FOR THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL SERIAL KILLER COULD BE THAT HE IS LATER SENT TO JAIL FOR THESE CRIMES HORRIBLE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PRISON LEADS HIM INTO THINKING SUICIDE IS THE ONLY OPTION BUT LITTLE DOES HE KNOW THE QUANTUM SUICIDE THEORY IS TRUE CAUSING HIM TO SPEND THE REST OF ETERNITY IN PRISON UNABLE TO KILL HIMSELF TO ESCAPE A LIVING HELL
THIS ARTICLE AND CONCOMMITANT THEORIES SEEM TO BE TOUCHING ON TWO THINGS FROM MY POV THEY ARE AND STATISTICAL MECHANICS

IN LOOKING AT A SYSTEM EMPATHIZING WITH IT FROM IT'S PERSPECTIVE BASED ON PHENOMENA WE OBSERVE FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT WE OBSERVED BY USING A SYSTEM OF MECHANICS PHYSICS MATH THAT HAS SHOWN IT'S ABILITY TO ELUCIDATE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE HOW THE SEES ITSELF

AND STATISTICAL MECHANICS IN THE VIEW OF THE PARTICLE PHENOMENA THE PANICLE PHENOM SEEMS TO BE A THRESHOLD FOR WHERE OUR SYSTEMS OF ANALYSIS MATH PHYSICS ETC SEEM TO REVERSE A THRESHOLD ALWAYS INDICATES SOMETHING AND THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE A MAJOR ONE AT THIS POINT PARTICLE S OUR TOOLS OF ANALYSIS MEANT TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY ACTUALLY FLIP AND INCREASE COMPLEXITY STARTING WITH A AND EXPLODING FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM OUTWARD ALLARD REALLY FROM A ALMOST LIKE A NON THREE-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE

THIS IS WHAT IN STATISTICAL MECHANICS IS KNOWN AS THE HYDRA THIS IS NAMED AS SUCH BECAUSE THE MORE YOU TRY TO QUANTIFY IT THE MORE COMPLEX IT GETS LIKE THE ANCIENT BEAST OF THE SAME NAME WHO ONCE IT HAD A HEAD CUT OFF WOULD GROW TWO IN IT'S PLACE SAME CONCEPT IT'S INTERESTING THAT ANCIENT HUMANS HAD A CONCEPTION OF A HYDRA NOT TO GET TOO ANACHRONISTIC AND CONFLATE OUR STATISTICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE MODERN WITH THE CONCEPTION OF THE HYDRA OF OLD IF YOU WANT TO TO GO DOWN HYDRA THEORY IN STATISTICAL MECHANICS I WOULD RECOMMEND BY NASHIM CALEB AND PROBABLY COMBINE IT WITH A STATISTICAL MECHANICS COURSE BY LEONARD SUSSKIND FREE ONLINE AS WELL AS OTHER PHYSICS AND COMPLEXITY AND PHILOSOPHICAL SUBSTRUCTURE

IN THIS QUANTUM THEORY CONUNDRUM BOTH PERSPECTIVES IN THIS ARTICLE WE ARE DEALING WITH IN QUANTUM PHENOMENA BEHAVIOR AND A THRESHOLD PARTICLE THAT INDICATES THE WHOSE COMPLEXITY INCREASES WHEN WE USE TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS TOOLS OF ANALYSIS TO REDUCE IT FOR CONCEPTUAL PROCESSING INTELLECTUAL DIGESTION

I MIGHT ALSO ADD FURTHER MY VIEW ON THE TERM EXPLOSIONS THE TERM EXPLOSIONS IN COMPLEXITY IN EITHER THE BIG BANG OR MULTIVERSE THERE IS NO GROWTH IN THE WAY WE COLLOQUIALLY CONCEPTUALIZE IT ALL THE CONSTITUENT PARTS ARE THERE FROM THE BEGINNING EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS IS INTERCONNECTED SO EXPLOSION OR BANG IS A MISNOMER WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT AN EXPLOSION IS LIKE TO INFINITY AND IS CONNOTATIVELY DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE NOT ANALOGUES I SUSPECT THE ONLY TRUE UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOR TO BE BINARY EITHER ON OR OFF FLUCTUATIONS MIGHT BE INDICATORS OF THIS PHENOMENA IF IT EXISTS BUT LIKELY ARE NOT AS WE CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND FLUCTUATIONS ARE AN INDICATOR OF SOMETHING ELSE SOMETHING SMALLER THAN UNIVERSAL BEHAVIOR BUT I THOUGHT I'D MENTION IT AS AN INDICATOR OF SOME LARGE BEHAVIOR

FURTHER SINCE THIS ARTICLE MAKES AN EXPLICIT BIFURCATION OF AND OTHER I MIGHT ADD MY OWN THEORY ON PHYSICAL MATTER THINGS THAT EXIST IN OUR OBSERVABLE CONCEIVABLE REALITY EXIST IN A SPECTRUM OF SPEED MOTION THAT IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT PARTICLES MOVE AT THIS SPEED WHICH IS WHY THEY EXIST BY THE WAY I DEFINED IT THESE PARTICLES ARE ACTUALLY NOT MATTER BUT THRESHOLDS I WILL STILL REFER TO THEM AS PARTICLES HOWEVER ACKNOWLEDGING IT'S CONNOTATIVE MISNOMER THEN ON TOP OF THOSE MOTION ITSELF I KNOW MOTION IS RELATIVE TO A SYSTEM THAT SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM IN THIS CASE HOWEVER IT HAS CONSISTENT ENOUGH BEHAVIOR IN OUR OBSERVABLE REALITY AND HENCE HAS A NAME LIGHT IS WHAT MATTER AS WE DEFINE IT IS BUILT ON TOP OF THROUGH THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS MATTER IS A PHENOMENA BUILT ON TOP OF RELATIVELY CONSISTENT MOTION THROUGH THE LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS THE MOVEMENT OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES ARE STABLE ENOUGH TO BUILD STRUCTURE ON TOP OF MATTER

WHAT ARE THE PARTICLES THEY ARE A SINGULAR THAT OUR REALITY BOTH BEGINS AND ENDS ON TOP OF AS AN ANALOGY NOT TO GET TO REDUCTIONISTIC BUT AS AN ANALOGUE I'LL USE THREE THREE-DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRIC SPACE OUR REALITY IS A CIRCLE ON TOP OF A POINT A POINT THAT IS A THRESHOLD THAT BOTH OPENS AND CLOSES THE CIRCLE THAT IN THIS EXAMPLE IS OUR CONCEIVABLE UNIVERSE WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD IT'S THE STATISTICAL HYDRA ESSENCE DERMIS TO ANTHROPOMORPHISE IT THE REASON IT'S CALLED A STATISTICAL HYDRA IS BECAUSE OF IT'S BEHAVIOR WHICH I DESCRIBED EARLIER THE WAY IT REACTS TO US TAKEN IN IT'S TOTALITY EXTRAPOLATED I HOPE IS WHY I CALL THE UNIVERSE A MOTHER HYDRA BECAUSE IT BEHAVES LIKE A HYDRA WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO QUANTIFY IT EITHER UP RED SHIFT OR DOWN COMPLEXITY EXPLOSION AND BECAUSE IT PRODUCED MAINTAINS US NO IMPLIED DIRECTION OF CAUSALITY HOWEVER AND OUR ENTIRE REALITY IN ALL ITS COMPLEXITY THE HYDRA IS COMPLEXITY ITSELF SOME SCIENTISTS ME DEFINE LIFE ITSELF AS COMPLEXITY AND THE MOTHER PART OF IT IF IT ISN'T OBVIOUS WOMEN FEMALE PRODUCE LIFE AND MOTHERS BY TERMINAL DEFINITION HAVE PRODUCED LIFE AND WE ARE HERE EVEN IF IT IS ONLY IN OUR OWN MINDS THAT MAKES IT A MOTHER FINALLY THE MOTHER HYDRA AS THE UNIVERSE ITSELF IS BEAUTIFUL SUBJECTIVE TO US IN THAT IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT A WAY TO BRING HOME INFINITY SO THAT OUR FINITE MINDS CAN CONCEPTUALIZE INFINITY IS TO THINK OF INFINITY AS A MOTHERS LOVE SO THE THING THAT CREATED CREATES MAINTAINS US LOVES US INFINITELY AND ALSO ELEGANT IN THE SCOPE AND BREADTH OF IT'S EXPLANATORY POWER AND THE RELATIVE SIMPLICITY OF THE THEOREM APPEAL TO RAZOR


I'M PROBABLY A BIT LATE TO THIS BUT ONE THING I REALLY STRUGGLE TO RECONCILE WITH THE MANY WORLDS EXPLANATION IS THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SHOULDN'T THERE BE LOTS OF THINGS HAPPENING THAT DON'T FIT WITH NORMAL PROBABILITY WHAT I MEAN IS THAT IF THERE ARE INFINITE UNIVERSES THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S A UNIVERSE OUT THERE WHERE EVERY SPIN OF EVERY ROULETTE WHEEL THAT HAS EVER EXISTED HAS LANDED ON BLACK THERE'S A UNIVERSE OUT THERE WHERE EVERY COIN TOSS EVER THROWN HAS BEEN HEADS TWO SCENARIOS THAT WOULD BE NOTICED BY THE PEOPLE POPULATING THOSE UNIVERSES SO WHY DOES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IN OUR UNIVERSE SEEM TO FOLLOW NORMAL PROBABILITY RULES SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH OF A COINCIDENCE THAT WE JUST HAPPEN TO BE IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE IT ALL MAKES SENSE SOME INSIGHT INTO THIS WOULD BE GREAT
THIS ARTICLE IS OFF BY

THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION LINKS CONSCIOUSNESS WITH REALITY YOU ALTER REALITY BY BEING CONSCIOUS OF SOMETHING


LET'S THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS WAS TRUE A PARTICLE INTERACTION HAPPENS SOMEWHERE IN FRONT OF US AND A PHOTON TRAVELS TOWARDS OUR EYE GETS TRANSLATED TO NEURAL CODE AND THE EVENT BECOMES CONSCIOUS AT LEAST MS LATER IF IT IS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT CAUSES THE COLLAPSE TO A STATE THEN THE WHOLE PATH FROM THE INTERACTION TO THE PART OF OUR BRAIN THAT MAKES THE EVENT CONSCIOUS WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE STATE AS WELL WHICH MEANS THAT IT HAD TO BE QUANTUM BEFORE THE INTERACTION THIS IS A FREQUENT FALLACY AND ITS ROOT IS THAT PEOPLE USE THE WORD OBSERVER WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT OBSERVING AN OBJECT IN A QUANTUM STATE COLLAPSES THE THEY MEAN THAT INTERACTING WITH THE OBJECT WILL MAKE IT PICK A STATE WHETHER THE INTERACTION WAS CAUSED BY A CONSCIOUS AGENT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH QUANTUM MECHANICS

THE INTERPRETATION PRESENTS A MORE ELEGANT ALTERNATIVE TO THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION IN TERMS OF ITS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ASSERT A RELATION BETWEEN OBSERVER S CONSCIOUSNESS AND REALITY

THIS IS ALREADY FALSE AS EXPLAINED IN MOREOVER IT IS THE INTERPRETATION THAT HAS MORE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE IT ASSUMES A THAT THERE ARE MORE WORLDS WHICH WE DO NOT OBSERVE AND B THEY ARE CAUSED BY A NEW QUANTUM PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE NOT TO MENTION THE IMPLICATIONS OF A PROCESS THAT CREATES A FULL COPY OF THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT LEAVING A TRACE

IF WE TAKE THINGS OBJECTIVELY WE HAVE TWO COMPETING THEORIES BOTH MIGHT SEEM EQUALLY PROBABLE BUT ONE INTRODUCES QUITE A LOT OF PHYSICS THAT WE CANNOT TESTAMENT REGRETTABLY IT'S THE ONE THAT ALLOWS US TO DO FUN THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS
THIS IS A THOUGHT THAT I HAVE HAD FOR OVER A YEAR NOW TSH I WAS AFRAID OF SPREADING IT AROUND IT'S A KIND OF BASILISK
ISN'T QUANTUM SUICIDE AN EXPERIMENT WE'VE ALL PERFORMED ALREADY BY MEANS OF THE OVERWHELMINGLY SLIM ODDS OF OUR OWN CONCEPTION AND BIRTH
CAN SOMEONE ELI THE NOTION OF MEASUREMENT IN QUANTUM MECHANICS FOR ME IF A PARTICLE CAN OCCUPY SEVERAL SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTORY POSITIONS BEFORE THE INSTANT OF MEASUREMENT HOW DO WE KNOW IF WE HAVEN'T MEASURED THEM OR IS THIS A PREDICTION BASED ON THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE INNER WORKINGS OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AS IN EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES INDICATES THAT THEY OCCUPY SUCH MULTIFARIOUS POSITIONS OR STATES YET WE CANNOT CATCH THEM IN THE ACT OR OTHERWISE DOCUMENT THAT THEY DO SO

THANK YOU FOR ANY REPLIES
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE MIGRATING SOUL COMPONENT THERE IS NO CONSCIOUS DIFFERENCE AS THE ABANDONED SINGULARITY DOES NOT EXIST TO THEM IN THEIR REALITY THEY WERE NOT HIT BY A BUS OR BULLET LIKE IN THE ONE THEY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THEY HAD NOT EXITED THEY HAVE MOVED INTO ANOTHER CHOSEN TEMPORAL ACCRETION EVENTUALITY
I'M TOTALLY NEW TO THIS SUB BUT I FIND IT UTTERLY FASCINATING THE WAY SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY INTERSECT I GUESS I'VE ALWAYS WRONGLY GROUPED PHILOSOPHY IN WITH RELIGION
I'M ALWAYS SURPRISED BY HOW SIMILAR THE MANY WORLD INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IS TO DAVID LEWIS ON THE PLURALITY OF WORLDS HE TAKES MODAL LOGIC AT ITS VALUE RATHER THAN QUANTUM MECHANICS
I DON'T SEE QUANTUM IMMORTALITY AS AN IMPLICATION OF THE QUANTUM SUICIDE EXPERIMENT RATHER THAN AN ASSUMPTION THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT ASSUMES THAT ONE EXPERIENCES THE VERSION OF THEMSELVES THAT LIVES REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCE IF YOU DETACH THIS NOTION THEN THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT PROVIDES NO INSIGHT AS TO WHICH INTERPRETATION IS CORRECT

PERSONALLY I'VE CONSIDERED THE IDEA OF QUANTUM IMMORTALITY BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT EVERYONE EXPERIENCES THE VERSION OF THEMSELVES THAT LIVES THE LONGEST THAT IS TO SAY THAT ONE WILL NEVER DIE IN A CAR CRASH FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE THERE IS A VERSION THAT WAS NOT IN THE CAR AT THAT TIME HOWEVER I FIND IT ABSURD TO THINK THAT BIOLOGY WOULD BE VIOLATED IN THIS CONCEPT AS THE ARTICLE PROPOSES

AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL INTERPRETATIONS I DON'T SEE HOW THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION CAN BE OF EQUAL MERIT TO THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION BOTH ARE UNVERIFIABLE SURE BUT THE IDEA THAT AN OBSERVATION WILL ALTER PHYSICAL STATES WITH NO CONTACT OR CONCEIVABLE QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT SEEMS A BIT FAR-FETCHED AT LEAST IN COMPARISON TO AN INTERPRETATION THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF OBSERVATION
THERE IS ONE POSSIBLE COUNTERARGUMENT FOR QUANTUM IMMORTALITY IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DIE FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW THEN EVENTUALLY YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE OUT EVEN THE SUN ITSELF AND ALL THE STARS IN THE UNIVERSE WHAT HAPPENS THEN LIFE NEEDS ENERGY OUTPUT TO CONTINUE AND ONCE WE REACH THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE THERE WILL BE NO MORE ENERGY BEING OUTPUTTED BY ANYTHING ANYMORE SURELY THAT WOULD MEAN THE PERMANENT END OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS UNLESS YOU COULD SOMEHOW CREATE NEW ENERGY
EXPLAIN LIKE I'M FIVE QUANTUM THEORY
CAN SOMEONE ELI
INTERESTING TOPIC BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE MORE PRETENTIOUS ARTICLES I'VE READ ALSO TOO MANY COMMAS
I HAVE NEVER READ OF QUANTUM IMMORTALITY BEFORE BUT THE PREMISE HAS CROSSED MY MIND I HAVE A TERMINAL ILLNESS CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND THERE HAVE MANY MOMENTS IN MY LIFE WHERE I HAVE THESE INTENSE NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES BUT I'VE PULLED THROUGH BUT WHAT LEAD ME TO THINKING ABOUT QUANTUM IMMORTALITY IS MY NATURAL SELECTION MOMENTS


CROSSING A ROAD AND ALMOST GETTING HIT AND HAVING THIS FEELING LIKE SOMETHING HAPPENED ONE DAY I ALMOST ACCIDENTALLY STARTED A HOUSE FIRE BUT I WAS SO SURE THAT I SHOULD OF GONE UP IN AN INFERNO AND REALITY BAFFLED ME SO MUCH AS TO HOW I WAS STILL ALIVE THAT I THOUGHT I MUST OF DIED AND MY CONSCIOUSNESS IS IMMORTAL BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I DIDN'T START A FIRE THAT DAY



NOW I'M NOT TRYING TO RUB MY EGO AND SAY THAT OH LOOK I THOUGHT OF QUANTUM IMMORTALITY RATHER THAT IF QUANTUM IMMORTALITY IS REAL THAT EVERY ONE OF THOSE REAL NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES AND FISSURES IN MY REALITY WERE MY DEATHS


THIS SHIT HIT ME HARD FAMILY
READ PERMUTATION CITY FOR A GREAT DESCRIPTION OF THE DUST THEORY
AS A PRACTICAL MATTER I WONDER IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO DETECT OUTLIER OR EXTREMELY UNPROBABLE SCENARIOS TO TEST BETWEEN THE INTERPRETATIONS
IF THE MANY WORLDS APPROACH IS THE ACTUAL ONE AND EVERY QUANTUM EVENT CAUSES A SPLIT OR PARALLEL UNIVERSE THEN WOULDN'T IT BE DETECTABLE THROUGH IMPROBABLE EVENTS OR EVENTS THAT FALL OUTSIDE OF AVERAGE THAT THE MANY WORLDS APPROACH WOULD ALLOW TO EXIST

OR IS THE VAST NUMBER OF PARTICLES TOO MUCH FOR THAT TO BE A REALISTIC THING TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE

I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD APPLY TO THE FIRST SCENARIO WHERE YOUR OBSERVATION LOCKS IN THE STATE OF THE SYSTEM BEING OBSERVED BUT I COULD BE WRONG AS I AM NOT A PHYSICIST OR ANYTHING

I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH QUANTUM IMMORTALITY AND THE QUANTUM DOOMSDAY DEVICE IS LARGELY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS LARGELY MISUNDERSTOOD AS A SYSTEM

YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS HAS A SHAPE IN NATURE AND THAT SHAPE CHANGES YOU ARE ALWAYS BECOMING A NEW PERSON AND THE OLD PERSON IS ALWAYS DYING IT IS A RELATIONSHIP AND THAT RELATIONSHIP CHANGES OVER TIME

SO WHEN THAT RELATIONSHIP CHANGES IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT NO LONGER BEARS RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT YOU WERE IT IS STILL THERE NOTHING HAS BEEN DESTROYED IT HAS ONLY BEEN CHANGED YOU WILL STILL HAVE AN EXPERIENCE IT WILL JUST BE AN EXPERIENCE THAT QUICKLY DEVOLVES INTO CHAOS
THIS IS ILLUSTRATED BEAUTIFULLY IN JASON COMIC BOOK MEANWHILE
DOESN'T THIS INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM EVENTS SHOW A MULTIVERSE I THOUGHT MOST THEORETICAL PHYSICISTS THINK THAT'S UNTRUE AND SUPERSYMMETRY IS THE MOST LIKELY
I DIDN'T READ THE SOURCES OR THE MATHEMATICAL PROOFS FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS BUT TO ME IF SOMEONE'S THEORY INVOLVES A WORLD OR UNIVERSE OR ANY SYSTEM THAT CAN'T BE OBSERVED THAT SEEMS LIKE A USELESS THEORY I COULD POSIT FOR INSTANCE A NEW AND UNLIKELY OUTCOME FOR A WELL UNDERSTOOD CHEMICAL PROCESS AND JUST SAY IT OCCURS IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE THAT WE CAN'T OBSERVE AM I RIGHT WRONG CAN YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE
THIS ARTICLE WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS I'VE READ IN A WHILE THANKS
WE DON'T NEARLY KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT QUANTUM SCIENCE TO DRAW THIS SORT OF CONCLUSIONS
IN ADDITION TO ALL THE ABOVE RESPONSES THESE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS DO NOT MAKE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN POSSIBLE AND IMAGINABLE THE TOTAL SET OF POSSIBILITIES OF AN EVENT DOESN'T NECESSARILY INCLUDE EVERY IMAGINABLE OUTCOME WHY SHOULD I ASSUME THAT IF I WERE TO ATTEMPT TO KILL MYSELF THERE IS AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE THAT EITHER IS OR COMES TO BE IN WHICH I SURVIVE THAT SEEMS A BIT VAIN PERSONALLY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY NOT PARTICULARLY RIGOROUS


LET'S SAY CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE OTHER UNIVERSES IN THE MULTIVERSE LET'S SAY THESE OTHER UNIVERSES ARE ALSO THE OTHER VERSIONS OF OUR SELVES WHO HAVE BEEN EFFECTED BY OUR OBSERVANCE OF THEM IN THE UNIVERSE IS BIRTH THE BIG BANG OF THESE UNIVERSES IT MAKES FOR AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT FOR THE CYCLIC NATURE OF LIFE AS WE CAN SEE THAT OUR LARGER PLANETARY UNIVERSE HAD A ONE AS WELL IT ALSO MAKES FOR AN INTERESTING ARGUMENT FOR SUPPORT OF EACH OTHER AND AGAINST SNUFFING A LIFE OR WHOLE UNIVERSE COPY OF YOURSELF OUT
THEY SHOULD ATTEMPT THE DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT IN SPACE JS
MAYBE THEY ALREADY HAVE
DELETED
EH THAT'S COMPLETELY DISREGARDING METAPHYSICS EDIT SOMEONE ELSE SAID WHAT I SAID MUCH MORE ARTICULATELY AND ACCURATELY BUT STILL I FEEL LIKE FROM A METAPHYSICAL PERSPECTIVE THIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE EITHER

A OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS A SOLID ENTITY WHICH CAN'T JUST JUMP TO WHICHEVER BRANCH OF THE MULTIVERSE IS CONVENIENT

OR

B OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT REALLY DEFINED BY SOLID BOUNDARIES SUCH AS THE BRAIN AND SO WE ARE KIND OF EVERYWHERE EXPERIENCING EVERYTHING WHICH MEANS NOTHING THAT HAPPENS CAN MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
IF THEIR ARE INFINITY UNIVERSES WHERE AS INDIVIDUALS WE LIVE FOREVER IS THAT THE AFTERLIFE NEVER DYING JUST CONTINUING TO EXIST THROUGH INFINITE UNIVERSES
WAIT SO I'M CONFUSED OBVIOUSLY THE EFFECT OF A PARTICLE'S MEASURED DIRECTION WON'T OFTEN BE A LIFE-OR-DEATH SITUATION BUT DOES IT EVEN HAVE A QUANTIFIABLE EFFECT ON REALITY AT ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEAD AND NOT DEAD IS LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AND WHERE VALUE MEANS I CAN AFFECT THE UNIVERSE IN A MEASURABLE WAY AND MEANS I CAN'T MEASURABLY AFFECT THE UNIVERSE WHAT ARE QUANTUM PHYSICISTS MEASURING HOW ARE THEY MEASURING IT AND WHAT EFFECTS DOES PARTICLE MEASURED AT OR UP HAVE ON THE UNIVERSE THAT ARE RECOGNIZABLY DISTINCT FROM THOSE MEASURED AS OR DOWN IF THEY BEHAVE THE SAME WAY THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL BE MAKING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN AND WHEN THE RELEVANT VALUE IS HOW FAR IT IS FROM IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THIS CORRECTLY

SEVERAL ADDITIONAL INTERPRETATIONS ARE SIMILAR TO THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION IN THAT THEY ALSO CREATE A LINK BETWEEN CONSCIOUSNESS AND REALITY

THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION CREATES NO LINK BETWEEN CONSCIOUSNESS AND REALITY
YOUR TIMELINE LOOKS LIKE A TREE WHERE EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A LIFE CHANGING DECISION IT BRANCHES SOMETIMES THOSE BRANCHES END AND THEN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS COLLAPSES BACK TO A BRANCH WHERE YOU ARE STILL ALIVE THE CENTER BRANCH IS THE TALLEST MEANING IT'S THE ONE WHERE YOU LIVE THE LONGEST LIFE THAT'S POSSIBLE FROM ALL YOUR DECISIONS AND OR SITUATIONS THAT YOU'VE MADE BEEN IN THIS LIFE TIMELINE VIEWED FROM OUTSIDE TIME LOOKS LIKE A TREE AND THEREFORE WE GET THE TREE OF LIFE
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BOOK OUR MATHEMATICAL UNIVERSE BY MAX TELEMARK WHICH TALKS ABOUT THIS AND RELATED TOPICS AT LENGTH

ONE INTERESTING POINT TELEMARK MAKES IS THAT THERE'S NO PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A QUANTUM MULTIVERSE AND AN INFINITE MULTIVERSE A MULTIVERSE SEPARATED BY SPACE EVERY ITERATION OF EVERY POSSIBILITY EXISTS OUT THERE JUST FAR BEYOND THE BILLION LIGHT YEAR BUBBLE WE CAN CURRENTLY SEE
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A PHYSICS INTERPRETATION OF ETERNAL RETURN

I THINK IT MAY BE BEST TO DESCRIBE THE UNIVERSE AS FUZZY

THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS ARE INTERESTING BUT THEY FAIL BY OVERSIMPLIFYING REALITY JUST AS CLASSICAL BEHAVIOR DOESN'T APPLY TO QUANTUM EVENTS QUANTUM BEHAVIOR DOESN'T APPLY TO MACRO EVENTS

MEASURING THE UP OR DOWN STATE IS LIKE TAKING A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE FUZZY STATE AND THE STATE AT THE TIME OF MEASUREMENT ISN'T PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT IF SOME ACTION IS TAKEN AS A RESULT OF A MEASUREMENT THEN THERE'S A REAL CHANGE BUT THE OVERALL RESULT IS STILL A FUZZY UNIVERSE

WHILE THE UNIVERSE IS FUZZY IT'S ALSO CONSISTENT TO THE POINT WHERE THE AGGREGATION OF QUANTUM EVENTS YIELDS CLASSICAL RESULTS ON A MACRO LEVEL BUT THIS STILL ALLOWS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A SORT OF BUTTERFLY EFFECT WHERE THE MEASUREMENT OF A QUANTUM STATE CAN APPEAR TO CAUSE A MACRO EVENT IN REALITY IT'S JUST A FANCY WAY OF ROLLING THE DICE WHERE AN UNCOUNTABLE NUMBER OF INSTANTANEOUS QUANTUM INTERACTIONS GENERATE THE RESULT

TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY MEASURE A QUANTUM STATE THE PROCESS OF TAKING THE MEASUREMENT IS INFLUENCED BY AND EVOLVES FROM THE WHOLE FUZZY QUANTUM ENVIRONMENT

EDIT SO ALL WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IS A TRANSFORMATION FROM A FUZZY UNIVERSE AT TIME A TO A FUZZY UNIVERSE AT TIME B WHERE THE TRANSFORMATION IS PREDICTABLE FROM STATISTICAL PROBABILISTIC PERSPECTIVE BUT NOT DETERMINISTIC


WELP THAT EXPLAINS THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS
I THINK WE ARE OVER THINKING THIS WHOLE QUANTUM THING

THE REASON SPIN APPEARS AS UP OR DOWN WHEN WE MEASURE IT IS BECAUSE WE MEASURED IT NO OTHER REASON

THE FACT THAT ITS IT SPINNING WHICHEVER WAY DOES MUCH CARE THAT WE MEASURED IT ITS JUST A SHOW IN OUR MINDS TO CONVINCE US WE KNOW WHAT FUCK WE ARE LOOKING AT

THE REALITY IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK WE ARE LOOKING AT SO MIGHT AS WELL SMOKE A BOWL AND TURN ON THE TV


I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK MANY WORLDS SEEMS INTUITIVE AT ALL IT ALSO DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A SIMPLER EXPLANATION THIS ARTICLE ACTS LIKE THERE'S A DICHOTOMY BETWEEN THE TWO INTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM PHYSICS AND INVALIDATING ONE VALIDATES THE OTHER HOWEVER IT'S QUITE POSSIBLY NEITHER ARE CORRECT
JUST THROWING THIS OUT THERE SOME OF THE POINTS MADE IN THE ARTICLE REMIND ME OF ALAN SPEECHES THE IS AND ISN'T AT THE SAME TIME
I FIND IT SLIGHTLY CONFUSING HOW A QUARK CAN ROTATE AND MOVE UP AND DOWN AT THE SAME TIME CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE IMAGINED BECAUSE OUR BRAINS ARE WIRED TO ATTRIBUTE MEANING TO EVERYTHING
ON A LITTLE SIDE NOTE I ALWAYS FIND THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS FASCINATING
THIS VERSION OF THE STORY IS FULL OF BUGS
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE MANY WORLDS THAT WE HAVE AN EXPERIMENT WITH TWO POSSIBLE OUTCOMES ONE OUTCOME IS SAID TO HAVE PERCENT PROBABILITY OF HAPPENING AND THE OTHER ACCORDING TO OWI BOTH OUTCOMES HAPPEN TO DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE PROBABILITIES THAT WE'VE ASSIGNED TO THE OUTCOMES ARE AM I WRONG
I CAN'T BELIEVE I USED TO SPECULATE THINGS LIKE THIS WHEN I WAS A KID IN SCHOOL AND ATE SCI-FI MOVIES LIKE ICE-CREAM AFTERWARDS WHEN I ACTUALLY STARTED READING STUFF LIKE QUANTUM PHYSICS AND AI THE INSTRUCTORS KEEP REMINDING US THE ACTUAL INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THIS MEANS TO US IN REAL WORLD IS A DISCUSSION IN PHILOSOPHY AND WE'LL SKIP THAT I I
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME

IS QUANTUM UNCERTAINTY TRULY ANALOGOUS TO CAT OR NO

ESSENTIAL SCHRDINGER TELLS US THAT SINCE WE CANNOT MEASURE WHETHER THE CAT IS ALIVE OR DEAD IT MUST BE BOTH BUT CONVENTIONAL PHYSICS WOULD SAY THAT IT IS EITHER AND ITS STATE IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR ABILITY TO MEASURE IT SO IS A QUARK ACTUALLY SPINNING BOTH UP AND DOWN AND THEN LOCKS IN WHEN WE OBSERVE IT OR IS IT ONLY ONE OR THE OTHER BUT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEASURE BEFORE WE INTERACT WITH IT
REALLY INTERESTING LET'S SUPPOSE THE MULTIVERSE THEORY IS ACTUALLY TRUE CONSIDER THE MORAL IMPLICATIONS NONE OF OUR ACTIONS WOULD HAVE ANY CONSEQUENCES IN THE COLLECTION OF REALITIES THEY OBVIOUSLY WOULD IN A SINGLE WORLD BUT IF WE KNEW THAT IN AT LEAST ONE OTHER UNIVERSE THEY WOULDN'T HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE CURRENT REALITY IS
I FIND THIS PARADOXICAL IF AFTER TRIES I SURVIVE I'D BE PRETTY CONFIDENT THE MANY WORLDS ARE REAL BUT MY ASSISTANT WAITING OUTSIDE WILL NOT BECAUSE TO HIM IT'LL BE AS UNLIKELY TO SEE ME ALIVE WHETHER THE MANY WORLDS ARE TRUE OR NOT HOW CAN WE LOGICALLY ARRIVE TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS WHILE HAVING THE EXACT SAME INFORMATION OR ELSE WHAT DO I KNOW THAT HE DOESN'T THAT LET ME ARRIVE TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION THAN HIS
SOMEWHERE THE CROCODILE HUNTER STILL LIVES
NOW I'M NOT SAYING WE ALL NEED TO BECOME QM HIPPIES BUT WHEN PEOPLE LATCH ON TO SOME ASPECT OF IT AND GET CARRIED AWAY THEIR LOGIC MAKES PERFECT SENSE AND THEY DESERVE AT LEAST A GRUDGING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THAT

I'M QUITE CONVINCED THAT NONLOCAL HIDDEN VARIABLE IS THE ONLY INTERPRETATION THAT MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU COMPARE ITS LOGICAL EXTREMES WITH THE WORLD WE EXPERIENCE

THAT STILL LEAVES US WITH PANPSYCHISM THOUGH
I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WOULD END UP LIVING FOREVER UNDER OUR CURRENT MODELS OF PHYSICS YOUR MIND WOULD EVENTUALLY BE IMPOSSIBLE ONCE THE SPACE-TIME YOU OCCUPY EXPANDS TO THE POINT WERE IT NO LONGER ALLOWS FOR A COMPLEX ENOUGH SYSTEM TO ALLOW ANYTHING THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED THOUGHT

QUANTUM IMMORTALITY ONLY WORKS IF THERE IS A CHANCE OF YOU SURVIVING IF THERE IS A CHANCE SUCH AS A GAMMA RAY BURST GUARANTEED TO HIT THE EARTH IN THE NEXT SECONDS THEN YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS OVER IN ALL POSSIBLE REALITIES
EVERY DAY I ATTEMPT TO WALK THROUGH A DIFFERENT WALL TO GAIN ACCESS TO AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE AND FIND THAT UNIVERSE'S COPY OF ME AND HANG OUT

SO FAR I HAVE NOT MADE IT THROUGH NOR HAS A COPY OF ME FROM AN ALTERNATE REALITY SHOWN UP TO HANG OUT

THUS WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT THE INTERPRETATION IS FALSE
MY NAME LIKES THIS
I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY PHYSICISTS AND OTHER SUPPOSEDLY RATIONAL MEN OF SCIENCE INSIST UPON CREATING INSANELY COMPLEX THEORIES TO JUMP THROUGH CONVOLUTED MENTAL HOOPS PURELY SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE THEIR MATH LITERALLY RATHER THAN SIMPLY ADMITTING THE OBVIOUS TRUTH WE DON'T KNOW THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PARTICLE WHILE IT IS NOT BEING OBSERVED AND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS NO WAY TO GAIN THE KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT IN SOME WAY OBSERVING IT

THEY WOULD RATHER SIT AND ARGUE FOR YEARS ON END THAT A CAT IN A BOX IS BOTH ALIVE AND DEAD THAN SIMPLY ADMIT THAT THEY DON'T ING KNOW WHETHER IT IS ALIVE OR DEAD AND WON'T FIND OUT UNTIL THEY OPEN THE BOX

EDIT TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT THOUGHT EXPERIMENT REGARDING THE CAT IS NOT MEANT TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY AND THAT EVEN PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THIS LUNACY GENERALLY CLAIM IT DOESN'T WORK ON A MACROSCOPIC SCALE ONLY ON THE QUANTUM LEVEL I SIMPLY MAINTAIN THAT IT MAKES NO MORE RATIONAL SENSE ON A QUANTUM LEVEL AND THAT ALL OF THE PROBLEMS SOLVED BY THESE CONVOLUTED THEORIES CAN BE QUITE SIMPLY EXPLAINED BY ADMITTING THAT WE DON'T KNOW SOMETHING AND THUS ARE FORCED TO ACCOUNT FOR MULTIPLE POSSIBILITIES IN OUR MATHEMATICS
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL AWARE THAT THIS IS PLAYING WITH COMMON MISINTERPRETATIONS OF QUANTUM PHYSICS BECAUSE PHILOSOPHERS WOULD LOOK REALLY REALLY STUPID TRYING TO SELL US ON QUANTUM MYSTICISM I MEAN I GET THAT YOU GUYS LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THE WORLD UNDER DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT SUPPORTED BY SCIENCE AND THAT THESE COMMON MISINTERPRETATIONS CAN BE REALLY INTERESTING THAT'S FINE WITH ME EVEN IF THEY FAIL SCIENCE'S SO WHAT TEST THEY CAN STILL BE INTERESTING SO INTERESTING THAT YOU SHOULD ALL GO CHECK OUT SOME ANIME THAT ALSO LIKE TO PLAY WITH THESE MISINTERPRETATIONS NAMELY THE RAILDEX SERIES AND CHAOS HEAD

SO WHILE I'M HERE LET ME PLAIN THE PHYSICS A BIT SO THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS REALITY AS DISTINCT FROM THESE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN QUANTUM PHYSICS WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED WAVE EQUATION THIS EQUATION WAS ORIGINALLY MADE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T PREDICT THE BEHAVIOR OF ELECTRONS IT HAS SENSE BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MORE MASSIVE PARTICLES THE EQUATION ESSENTIALLY USES PROBABILITY WAVES TO PREDICT ELECTRON BEHAVIOR IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A PROBABILISTIC THEORY IT CAN ONLY MAKE PREDICTIONS IN LARGE NUMBERS NOW THIS MYSTERIOUS WAVE EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT IS A PROBABILITY WAVE IT'S NOT SOME SORT OF STRETCHED OUT ELECTRON NOR DOES IT INDICATE THE ELECTRON IS IN-BETWEEN EXISTENCES ELECTRONS ARE REAL FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES THEY'RE WELL KNOWN TO BE DISCRETE ENTITIES A PROBABILITY WAVE ON THE OTHER HAND IS WHAT PHYSICIST CALL A VIRTUAL CONSTRUCT VIRTUAL CONSTRUCTS NEVER REALLY EXIST AND ARE ONLY USEFUL WITHIN A PARTICULAR CONTEXT IN THE CASE OF A PROBABILITY WAVE IT'S ONLY USEFUL IN AN ENERGY DIAGRAM USUALLY AN ENERGY WELL IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO TALK ABOUT A FREE PROBABILITY WAVE THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO SAYING I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE MY ELECTRON IS ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN TALK ABOUT FREE ELECTRONS IN A VACUUM NOTE THE MORE COMMON VIRTUAL PARTICLE PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT IN THEIR FRESHMAN PHYSICS COURSES IS THE PHONON WHICH ONLY EXISTS MAKES SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF A CRYSTAL LATTICE

NOW THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE HOPEFULLY A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF EDGY TEENAGERS WHO UNDERSTAND ALL THAT AND STILL WANT TO ARGUE BECAUSE THEY LACK A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE USUALLY WHAT THOSE ARGUMENTS COME DOWN TO IS THAT SCIENCE DOESN'T PLAY WITH INDETERMINISM SCIENCE ADHERES TO DETERMINISM AND ACCEPTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A THEORY GOOD ENOUGH TO PREDICT EXACT DETAILS THIS GOES WITH CHAOS THEORY'S DEFINITION OF RANDOM AS UNKNOWN FACTORS IN A DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM LIKE BACKGROUND NOISE PROBABILISTIC THEORIES IN SCIENCE ALSO ADHERE TO THIS HOWEVER PROABABILITISM ELSEWHERE IS SOMETIMES INTERPRETED WITH THE IDEA OF RANDOMNESS AS INDETERMINISM SCIENCE NOUN CAN'T SCIENCE VERB AN INDETERMINABLE ASPECT OF A SYSTEM AND BECAUSE SCIENCE DOESN'T DEAL WITH THINGS IT THAT CAN'T BE MEASURED MEASUREMENTS REQUIRE CONSISTENCY SO SCIENCE TOSSES THE INDETERMINABLE

YOU GUYS CAN STILL PLAY YOUR THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS AND TAKE THE INDETERMINABLE BUT THAT'S NOT SCIENCE AND THAT'S OKAY IT'S STILL INTERESTING I JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE WITH WHAT SCIENCE IS AND THAT NO ONE IS TRYING TO SELL ME PSEUDO SCIENTIFIC QUANTUM MYSTICISM
I'VE READ A BIT ABOUT THESE RECENTLY IT'S QUITE INTERESTING I'M WRITING A SHORT STORY ABOUT THEM AT THE MOMENT SO WILL GIVE THIS A GOOD READ LATER ON
ONE AREA THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS IS THE INTERESTING CASE OF CONVERGENCE IF ALL OF THESE SPLITS ARE HAPPENING THEN EVENTUALLY CHANCE WILL DICTATE THAT TWO SPLIT UNIVERSES WILL CONVERGE BACK INTO THE SAME ONE I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING IDEA TO EXPLORE AS WELL
AWESOME READ
QUANTUM IMMORTALITY IS ONE OF THOSE IDEAS I WISH I HAD NEVER ENCOUNTERED I KNOW IT'S POINTLESS BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE LEFT MY LOVED ONES BEHIND
THE MANDELA EFFECT POINTS US IN THOSE DIRECTIONS
AUTHORS DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A MACHINE GUN WORKS PULLING THE TRIGGER TEN TIMES ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT RESULT IN ONLY TEN SHOTS IN ANY UNIVERSE ALSO ANY DUD IN THE CHAIN CAUSES THE GUN TO NOT FIRE ANY ADDITIONAL ROUNDS UNTIL THE ACTION IS RESET IN EVERY UNIVERSE WHERE THE DUD WAS FIRED
DIDN'T THE LOC SUFFER SOME WEIRD PROBLEMS BEFORE BEING TURNED ON
MY PROBLEM WITH THE WHOLE IDEA OF QUANTUM IMMORTALITY IS THAT IT IS ASSUMED THAT WE DON'T HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS UPON DEATH
HOW DOES QUANTUM IMMORTALITY DEAL WITH THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE HOW ABOUT FALLING INTO A BLACK HOLE
THOUGH A NEAT IDEA QUANTUM IMMORTALITY TAKES AS A GIVEN THAT WE ARE IN THE UNIVERSE IN WHICH WE LIVE I SEE NO REASON WHY IT SHOULD DEFAULT TO WHERE THE OBSERVER LIVES
WHAT IF WE DIE AND ANOTHER ONE OF US CONTINUES LIVING
EDIT DIE TO LIVE
HOW DOES THE MANY WORLDS INTERPRETATION ACCOUNT FOR THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE
OK LOOK AN ABSTRACT OF AN ABSTRACTED BASED ON WHAT PEOPLE ADMITTEDLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS BEYOND STUPID THIS IS WHAT THIS IS
I READ THIS ON REDDIN WHILE A GIRL HAD ME WAIT A MINUTE WHILE SHE WENT TO PUT ON LINGERIE AND SHE TOLD ME IT'S THE BEST SEX WE'VE HAD I THINK I'LL LET HER BELIEVE IT WAS HER THAT TURNED ME ON
HENCE IT IS ARGUED I WILL NEVER ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE MY OWN DEATH BUT FROM MY OWN PERSPECTIVE WILL LIVE FOREVER EVEN AS COUNTLESS OTHERS WILL WITNESS ME DIE COUNTLESS TIMES LIFE HOWEVER WILL GET VERY LONELY SINCE EVERYONE I KNOW WILL EVENTUALLY DIE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND IT WILL SEEM I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO IS LIVING FOREVER IN FACT EVERYONE ELSE IS LIVING FOREVER ALSO BUT IN DIFFERENT UNIVERSES FROM ME THATS WHAT EXACTLY I HAD EXPERIENCED WHILE AY LAST DEATH WHEN WAKING UP THE WORLD EXISTED BUT THE FOLKS WITHIN IT DIDNT OR COULDNT NOTICE ME AT ALL IT WAS BY FAR THE BEST EXPERIENCE I FELT THE MOURNING OF AN FRIENDS AS IF THEY FADED AWAY AS THEY WOULD IN REAL LIFE THE ODD THING I FELT AS IF THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW NOW ARE ARE PUT IN REALITY FOR NO REASON BUT TO KEEP OUR LIVES RESPECTED TO FEEL A PART OF IT
THEORY IS FRANKLY A COMPLETELY ILLOGICAL MODEL OF THOUGHT FIRST OF ALL IT STATES THAT MEASUREMENT CAUSES A SPLIT IN REALITY CREATING A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE IN WHICH THE MEASUREMENT RESULTED IN A DIFFERENT OUTCOME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS HOW THE UNIVERSE IS SUBJECT TO CAUSALITY WHICH STATES THAT IT MUST HAVE HAD A SET CAUSE AN IMMOVABLE MOVER

THEREFORE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE THAT A MEASUREMENT CAN RESULT IN AN ALTERNATE OUTCOME BECAUSE THE VALUE OF ALL THESE VARIABLES THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE WERE ALREADY SET IF THERE IS A PENNY ON THE GROUND WHETHER OR NOT I WILL PICK UP THE PENNY IS DETERMINED BY THE VARIABLES MY MOOD THE CLEANLINESS OF THE PENNY IF I'M IN A HURRY OR NOT THESE VARIABLES ARE THE RESULT OF A LONG SERIES OF ACTIONS AND RESULTS AND ARE SET THEORY PROPOSES THAT THESE VARIABLES CAN SOMEHOW CHANGE IN SOME NEBULOUS WAY AND THE REASON BEHIND THIS IS NOT EVEN ADDRESSED

ALSO WHERE IS ALL THIS ENERGY AND MATTER COMING FROM IF THERE IS ENOUGH MATTER FOR ONE UNIVERSE HOW IS ENOUGH RAW MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR ANOTHER ONE
TL R IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPERIENCE DEATH SO CONSCIOUSNESS CONTINUES I WAS INTO THIS STUFF BEFORE IT WAS COOL AND I HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF IT THAN YOU WANNABES EVER COULD
QUANTUM SUICIDE IS DISGUSTING AND THE DOOMSDAY DEVICE CAN GET SHOVED UP THE ASS OF THE FILTHY OPERATORS I AM DEAD SERIOUS WHEN I SPEAK ABOUT QUANTUM SUICIDE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A RITUAL SUICIDE WHERE THE VICTIM AGAINST HIS OR HER WILL IS CONTINUOUSLY TORTURED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THROUGH BRAINWAVE FREQUENCIES VERY OFTEN TIMES EXCRUCIATING OR DEADLY PAIN AND OR DEATH OUR GOVERNMENT'S WAY OF GETTING RID OF PEOPLE IT DOESN'T LIKE OR DEEM UNWORTHY THERE HAVE BEEN INNOCENT PEOPLE AND OTHERS WHO HAVE GOTTEN IN THE QUANTUM SUICIDE IN THE INVOLVEMENT OF FOUL PLAY

IT'S CALCULATED IT'S ALL FREAKING CALCULATED ANYONE WITH AN EYE AND AN EAR CAN SEE IT BUT IT'S CALCULATED CRAP ESPECIALLY THAT DOOMSDAY DEVICE

I BELIEVE ONLY THE QUANTUM EXPLOSION SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR THE MOST NOTORIOUS IN SOCIETY AS IN THOSE WHO POSE A THREAT TO THE WELFARE OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT THE BULLYING WE'VE BEEN SEEING ALL TOO OFTEN FROM BOTH 3RD PARTY AND OTHER ENTITIES

IN ALL IT'S VERY ILLEGAL AND NEEDS TO BE STOPPED IT WAS STOPPED BEFORE THEN IT GOT PICKED UP AGAIN BY ALL THESE CRAZY ASS OTHER SCIENTIST WHO QUIET FRANKLY GIVE THE REST OF US A BAD NAME
HEY GEOFF

I WAS WONDERING HOW MUCH TIME AS A PHILOSOPHER ONE SHOULD SPEND ARGUING WITH FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK AND DOES THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME CHANGE GO UP OR DOWN WITH AGE TENURE PRESTIGE

THANKS


MY QUESTION FROM THE OTHER PAGE

THANK YOU PROF LYNN FOR THIS AMA

RECENT WORK IN PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE HAS CENTERED AROUND PEJORATIVE LANGUAGE WHERE MOST THEORISTS TEND TO AGREE THAT SLURS IN PARTICULAR COMMUNICATE DEROGATORY CONTENTION

MY QUESTION IS THIS DO YOU THINK THERE IS SIGNIFICANT SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE DEROGATION PRESENT IN SLURRING AND THE DEGRADATION PRESENT IN INSTANCES OF TESTIMONIAL INJUSTICE
HI GEOFF

THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS ALL OF WHICH ARE ABOUT GRADUATE SCHOOL I D APPRECIATE ANY FEEDBACK ON ANY OF THE QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO COMMENT UPON

CAN YOU TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS OF APPLYING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL SPECIFICALLY WHAT AREAS OF THE APPLICATION DO YOU THINK ARE WORTH REALLY EMPHASIZING

2 CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS OF CHOOSING A GRADUATE SCHOOL ASSUMING ONE IS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET INTO MORE THAN ONE WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT SHOULD HELP DETERMINE THAT KIND OF DECISION

CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MA PROGRAMS PHD PROGRAMS JOINT PROGRAMS JD PHD MD PHD MBA PHD ETC ETC NOT SURE WHAT WOULD BE BEST FOR ME AS MY INTERESTS ARE STILL UNDERDEVELOPED

I KNOW THAT S A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT ANY FEEDBACK WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED GIVEN THAT YOU DID YOUR PHD AT YALE AND NOW RUN AN MA PROGRAM I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE GOOD INSIGHT INTO THESE

THANKS

HELLO MR PROFESSOR LATELY ON MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN LEARNING MORE AND MORE FROM YOUTUBE VIDEOS WITHOUT TRYING TO TAKE ANY LEGITIMACY OUT OF THE QUALITY OF THE CONTENT ONE MAY GET FROM IT AS I BELIEVE IS NORMALLY DONE I HAVE SEEN MANY CHANNELS IN ENGLISH WITH AMAZING CONTENT I AM STARTING TO FIND CHANNELS IN MY LANGAUGE SPANISH WHO ARE FOLLOWING THE SAME TREND FRENCH GERMAN ETC NOT SURE WHO STARTED TO MAKE THIS KIND OF EDUCATIVE VIDEOS LIKE SCHOOL OF LIFE AND OTHERS THAT REQUIRE MORE COMPREHENSION OF THE TOPICS AS YOU GET DEEPER BUT MY QUESTION IS CAN KNOWLEDGE BE DEVELOPED QUICKLY FOR NEW GENERATIONS AS WE LEARN TO OPEN MORE RECEPTORS IN ORDER LEARN MORE FROM REDUCED TRANSMITTERS OF INFORMATION BY THIS REDUCED I MEAN OH ITS A VIDEO YOU WENT GET AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD GET FROM A BOOK KNOWLEDGE TAKES MORE THAN THAT HOPE MY QUESTION IS VALID IF NOT THANKS ANYWAYS
HI PROF LYNN THANKS FOR DOING THE AMA

WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BEST RESPONSE IS TO THE PROBLEM OF NEGATIVE EXISTENTIAL ALSO HOW DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD MAKE SENSE OF NONEXISTENT OBJECTS IN GENERAL
HI GEOFF

I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THE ROLE OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE PUBLIC OBVIOUSLY FROM YOUR WORK WITH AND OUR MANY CONVERSATIONS I KNOW ONE WAY IN WHICH YOU SEE IT'S VALUE BUT I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU THINK PHILOSOPHY CAN BE A PART OF THE BROADER CONVERSATION I SUPPOSE I'M ALSO CURIOUS IF YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE A PART OF THE LARGER CONVERSATION

DOES KNOWING THAT P REQUIRE A BELIEF IN P AND A SECOND KNOWING THAT P IS TRUE DOES THIS SECOND KNOWING REQUIRE A THIRD THAT THAT BELIEF IS TRUE RESULTING IN A REGRESS IN OTHER WORDS DOES KNOWING THAT THE CAT IS ON THE MAT REQUIRE KNOWING THAT THE CAT IS ON THE MAT IS TRUE WHICH REQUIRES KNOWING THAT THE CAT IS ON THE MAT IS TRUE IS TRUE AND SO ON
HI GEOFF I AM GLAD YOU ARE DOING THIS

WHAT IS A NORM OF ASSERTION AND WHY AREN'T THERE ANY EPISTEMIC ONES
HI GEOFF THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS

PHILOSOPHY HAS ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE A VERY ISOLATED INDEPENDENT PROFESSION DESPITE BEING APPLICABLE TO ESSENTIALLY EVERY OTHER FIELD OF INQUIRY

AS A SOCIAL SCIENTIST WHO IS INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY THE MORE RECENT MOVEMENT IS PRETTY ENCOURAGING IN TERMS OF INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION I WOULD LOVE TO DO JOINT WORK WITH A PHILOSOPHER TO SHARPEN MY LOGIC RIGOR AND IDEAS ANY TIPS ON HOW TO FIND PHILOSOPHER'S INTERESTED IN APPLIED EMPIRICAL RESEARCH
THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA I'VE BEEN STUDYING LANGUAGE SEMANTICS AND TRUTH THEORIES THIS PAST YEAR IT SEEMS THAT MANY AUTHORS GRANT THAT PROPOSITIONS ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH BEARERS OR AT LEAST THAT IT IS PLAUSIBLE THAT THEY ARE BUT WHEN DEVELOPING TRUTH THEORIES THEY DEFAULT TO SENTENCES AS FOR EXPEDIENCY THIS IDEA IS EXPRESSED IN THE FOLLOWING QUOTE FROM THE LINKED FEFERMAN PAPER

WE HAVE FIRST TO ADDRESS THE COMMON PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUE WHETHER
TRUTH IS A PREDICATE OF SENTENCES OR OF PROPOSITIONS WE WOULD CERTAINLY GRANT THAT IF TWO SENTENCES FROM THE SAME OR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES EXPRESS THE SAME PROPOSITION THEN THEIR TRUTH CONDITIONS AGREE THAT WOULD SEEM TO ARGUE IN FAVOR OF TRUTH AS A
PREDICATE OF PROPOSITIONS THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF SENTENCES IS THAT WE HAVE EXCELLENT THEORIES OF SENTENCES AS STRUCTURED SYNTACTIC OBJECTS THESE CAN BE DEALT WITH IN FULL PRECISION AND WITH GREAT FLEXIBILITY IN FORMAL THEORIES OF SYNTAX AS PROVIDED FOR EXAMPLE IN CONCATENATION THEORY OR ELEMENTARY SET THEORY OR IN ARITHMETIC VIA GODEL CODING THE NATURE OF PROPOSITIONS IS OBSCURE BY COMPARISON ONE ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE STRUCTURED OBJECTS AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR A SENTENCE TO EXPRESS A PROPOSITION WHEN DO TWO SENTENCES EXPRESS THE SAME PROPOSITION ARE ALL PROPOSITIONS EXPRESSIBLE IN SOME LANGUAGE FINALLY DO ALL SENTENCES IN A GIVEN LANGUAGE EXPRESS A PROPOSITION WHEN WE SETTLE AS IS CUSTOMARY IN WORK ON AXIOMATIC THEORIES OF TRUTH ON SENTENCES BEING THE ONE AVOIDS DEALING WITH ALL BUT THE LAST OF THESE DIFFICULTIES


FEFERMAN PAPERS

SO MY QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THAT PROPOSITIONS OR SENTENCES ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL AND DO YOU THINK THAT IT COULD BE THE CASE THAT SETTLING ON SENTENCES TO AVOID SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES OF USING PROPOSITIONS NECESSARILY COMES WITH CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IF IN FACT PROPOSITIONS ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH BEARERS
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE PARTNER IN CRIME SORT OF ARGUMENT FOR MORAL REALISM TO MY KNOWLEDGE POPULARIZED BY TERENCE CUNEO IN THE NORMATIVE WEB WHEREIN MORAL NORMS ARE LIKENED TO EPISTEMIC NORMS AND IT IS ARGUED WE CANNOT REJECT ONE WITHOUT REJECTING THE OTHER
THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA
GREAT TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE BUT I HAVE NOT DIVED INTO IT YET BUT FROM THE OUTLOOK OF IT IT SOUNDS VERY INTERESTING

SO SORRY IF I ASK SOME SHALLOW QUESTIONS

I WONDER WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON EMOTION IN RELATION TO TESTIMONIAL INJUSTICE AND EPISTEMIC DEGRADATION HOW IMPORTANT CAN EMOTION BE
OF COURSE OUR NEW KNOWLEDGE OF SAY JONES CAN CHANGE OUR EMOTION TOWARDS HIM FOR INSTANCE FROM SUSPECTING JONES STOLE YOUR PENCIL TO FINDING OUT HE JUST WANTS TO SHARPEN IT FOR YOU OUR EMOTION TOWARDS JONES HAS CHANGED FROM ANGRY TO HAPPY THERE WE HAVE THE COGNITION CHANGES EMOTION VIEW
BUT THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT EMOTIONS CAN SOMETIMES BE ALTERED BY MEAN SUCH AS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CUP OF BEVERAGE YOU ARE HOLDING CHANGE YOUR JUDGEMENT ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF TARGET PERSON HUGGING A TEDDY BEAR MAKES YOU FEEL LESS EXCLUDED IN GROUP COLOUR OF THE ENVIRONMENT CAN CHANGE YOUR MOOD AND SO ON THE WORRY IS NOT JUST RELATED FACTORS CAN CHANGE OUR EMOTION BUT THAT SUCH EMOTION IN TURN INFLUENCE OUR JUDGEMENT SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME CASES OF INVOLUNTARY EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE DUE TO THE CHANGE OF EMOTION CAUSED BY RELATED FACTOR S

SO MAYBE THE INVESTIGATION OF EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE SHOULD MORE OR LESS WORK ALONG WITH INVESTIGATION OF EMOTION AS WELL
THANK YOU
HI GEOFF

AS A RECENT PHILOSOPHY MA GRAD I MADE THE TOUGH DECISION TO PURSUE A DIFFERENT CAREER IN TECH RATHER THAN GO FOR A PHD THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE OTHER STUDENT IN MY CLASS WHO MADE THE SAME DECISION MY QUESTIONS ARE THIS

WHAT WORK DO YOU THINK NEEDS TO IS BEING DONE TO MAKE PURSUING A CAREER IN PHILOSOPHY LESS RISKY AND MORE OF A VIABLE OPTION OR DO YOU THINK WE WE BEING THE PHILOSOPHICAL COMMUNITY HAVE THE POWER TO DO THIS AT ALL

2 DO YOU SEE THE MIGRATION OF PHILOSOPHY STUDENTS TO OTHER CAREERS AS A GOOD OR BAD THING TO YOU THINK THIS HELPS TO MAKE OTHER FIELDS AREAS OF THOUGHT MORE AWARE OF PHILOSOPHY OR DOES IT DETRACT FROM PHILOSOPHY AS A FIELD

THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA
MY QUESTION IS ABOUT SELF-UNDERSTANDING OF JUSTIFICATION FOR A PIECE OF CONTROVERSIAL KNOWLEDGE WHEN I TOOK EPISTEMOLOGY MY FRIENDS AND I TALKED A LOT ABOUT A CASE WHERE TO ALL EXTERNAL OBSERVERS AN INDIVIDUAL APPEARED QUITE GUILTY OF A CERTAIN CRIME VIDEO EVIDENCE AN EYE-WITNESS OR TWO ETC HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION WHILE RECOGNIZING HOW BAD IT LOOKS AND HOW REASONABLE EVERYONE IS TO FIND HIM GUILTY CANNOT HIMSELF BELIEVE IN HIS GUILT BECAUSE HE NOT ONLY HAS NO MEMORY OF PERFORMING SUCH CRIMINAL ACTS BUT DISTINCTLY REMEMBERS AS WELL HE HAS EVER REMEMBERED ANYTHING HAVING DONE SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT AT THE SAME TIME ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN HE SEES THE EXTERNAL EVIDENCE BUT HIS INTERNAL SENSE OF REALITY THROUGH MEMORY AND LACK THEREOF PREVENTS HIM BELIEVING IN HIS OWN GUILT


IF I WERE IN THIS INDIVIDUAL'S POSITION HOW SHOULD I REGARD MY OWN KEN IS MY STRONG INTERNAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY HOLDING TO MY INNOCENCE AGAINST SOME FAIRLY DAMNING EXTERNAL EVIDENCE COULD I REASONABLY SAY YES THE EVIDENCE FOR THE CONTRARY IS STRONG BUT I KNOW I DIDN'T DO THIS

EDIT CAN I JUSTIFY THE GREAT CERTAINTY I WOULD FEEL
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE ACADEMIC REPUTATION OF STREET COLLEGE I AM APPLYING TO LEITER PHD PROGRAMS FROM SJC THIS FALL AND WANT TO KNOW IF I HAVE A REALISTIC CHANCE WITH A GA AND A GRE ASSUMING DECENT LETTERS STATEMENT AND ESSAY

WHAT IS YOUR IDEA ON THE SUBJECT OF FREE WILL FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL NEUROSCIENTIFIC POINT OF VIEW

2 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT NIETZSCHE CRITICISM OF TRUTH ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO LANGUAGE IN HIS BOOK BER WAHRHEIT UND LEGE IM AUSSERMORALISCHEN INNE ON TRUTH AND LIES IN A NORMAL SENSE


HI GEOFF

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO LANGUAGE

DO YOU PAY ANY ATTENTION TO IT AT ALL WHAT CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY HAVE YOU READ OR CONSIDERED WORTHWHILE IF ANY
HEY GEOFF LYNN FIRST OF ALL THANKS FOR THE AMA

QUESTION WILL PHILOSOPHY EVER BECOME USELESS AS SCIENCE PROGRESSES OR WILL THERE ALWAYS BE THINGS TO QUESTION

I GUESS THIS GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THE QUESTION IS THERE INFINITE KNOWLEDGE
I'M CURRENTLY READING RANDALL KENNEDY FOR MY SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE THAT KENNEDY IS GETTING AT WHEN EXPLAINING HOW RACISM IS MORE POWERFUL IN ITS LANGUAGE OVER HATE BY RELIGIOUS VIEWS
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE TRENDS OF THE CURRENT PHILOSOPHY IS TAKING WITH ALL THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS AND HOW THEY ARE CHANGING THE WAY WE INTERACT I THINK WHAT ARE THE PHILOSOPHICAL CURRENTS BRANCHES THAT ARE BEING BORN IMPROVED REVISITED
HEY THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA
AND I JUST HAVE A REALLY SHORT QUESTION AS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHO REALLY ENJOYS PHILOSOPHY WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST VALUABLE THING THAT YOU HAVE EVER LEARNED FROM SAID SUBJECT
HELLO GEOFF THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS

I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT MYSELF FORMERLY JUST HISTORY AND NOW HISTORY PHILOSOPHY SO I'M STILL ONLY ABOUT SHIN TO KNEE DEEP IN THIS

HAVING WATCHED YOUR VIDEO ON VIRTUE EPISTEMOLOGY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE YET TO LEARN ABOUT I HAVE A PREMATURE QUESTION I'M CURRENTLY CONCERNED WITH WHAT WE CAN KNOW ABOUT FICTIONAL OBJECTS DO YOU THINK THAT VIRTUE EPISTEMOLOGY COULD HELP SUPPORT A METAPHYSICS WHERE THERE ARE REAL FICTIONAL OBJECTS PUBLIC OR PRIVATE IN ADDITION WHAT ARE SOME GOOD SOURCES FOR VIRTUE EPISTEMOLOGY BOTH THAT TALK ABOUT ITS CORE AND ONES THAT BRIDGE INTO VIRTUE ETHICS THANKS AGAIN
SO UH CAN ANYTHING TRULY BE KNOWN FOR CERTAIN AND IF NOT HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
HELLO PROFESSOR

IM A GRADUATE OF FILM SCHOOL AND WE HAD A SUBJECT CALLED FILM THEORY AND IT TEACHES HOW PHILOSOPHY WAS USED AS A WAY TO EXPLAIN CINEMA BECAUSE OF THAT IM PLANNING TO ENTER A MASTERS IN PHILOSOPHY IN THE FUTURE

MY QUESTIONS ARE

REGARDING AESTHETICS HOW AESTHETICS CAN BE APPLIED IN THE STUDY OF VISUAL ARTS AND DO YOU KNOW ANY MODERN PHILOSOPHER THAT HAS STUDIED AESTHETICS

2 MARTIAL ARTS IS THERE A EPISTEMOLOGICAL WAY TO EXPLAIN HOW WE LEARN MARTIAL ARTS OR ANY COMBAT SPORTS



I HOPE I'M NOT TOO LATE TO THE PARTY

I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THE PROBLEM OF IDENTITY LIKE THE SHIP OF THESEUS IS EASILY SOLVED WHEN YOU SEE THROUGH IDENTITY AS A DEFINITIVE DESCRIPTION IT IS RATHER AN ALL INCLUSIVE CONCEPT THAN A PARTICULARISE DESCRIPTION THE SHIPS INCLUSIVE IDENTITY IS ANY OF IT'S STATES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE CONCEPTION OF THE SHIP SO IDENTITY CAN BE SEEN AS ALL INCLUSIVE WHERE PEOPLE TAKE IN PARTICULARISE CONCEPTS BASED ON RELEVANCY

SOMEONE WHO BUILD THE SHIP WILL NOTICE IT'S PART BEING REPLACED BUT THE WIFE OF A SAILOR WOULD ONLY CARE FOR HER HUSBAND THE CONCEPT OF THE SHIPS IDENTITY REVOLVES AROUND HER HUSBAND ON THE SHIP
THE PROBLEM OF IDENTITY LIES IN RELEVANCY OF CONCEPTS NOT IF THE SHIP CHANGES OR NOT

COULD YOU EITHER DESTROY THIS ARGUMENT OR EXPAND ON IT
WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT MICHAEL QUOTE HUMANS ARE PATTERN SEEKING ANIMALS WHO ARE ADEPT AT SEEKING THEM WHETHER OR NOT THEY EXIST
HI IM SORRY IF SOMEONE ALREADY ASKED IN THE COMMENTS ABOVE ARE YOU MORE OF AN EMPIRISM OR A RATIONALIST IN EPISTHÉMOLOGIE
IS DISAGREEMENT POSSIBLE BETWEEN REASONABLE PEOPLE LOOKING AT THE SAME EVIDENCE


EVER SINCE CHILDHOOD I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I HAVE TO BELIEVE HUMAN RIGHTS IS A GOOD THING BUT THEY INCLUDE THE FREEDOM TO THINK WHATEVER I WANT

IS THERE ANY BOOK OR PAPER YOU'D RECOMMEND THAT DISCUSS THIS KIND OF TOPIC NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS BUT ON HOW A LIBERAL MORAL SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTS ITSELF WHEN CLAIMING IT IS BETTER THAN OTHER MORALS
WHY BUS ALWAYS COMING WHEN SOMEONE STARTS SMOKING AS NO SMOKING PERSON IT'S KILLS ME
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHER HUME
IF AN ANIMAL CAN NOT RECOGNISE THAT HE IS LIVING MIRROR TEST THEN ITS ONLY PURPOSE IN LIFE IS THE BIOLOGICAL ONE TO BREED

MY QUESTION IS IS IT WRONG TO LET'S SAY A DOG UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES

IN THE BIBLE PSALMS I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS BUT I THINK IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION
HMM OK I'LL PLAY
WHY DO ONE GO AND LEARN PHILOSOPHY
AT THE END OF THE DAY EVERY BOOK YOU'LL READ IS A PERSONAL STORY OF THE ONE WHO WROTE IT
A STORY WHY OF LIFE OPINION HER OR HIS PATHOLOGY
YOUR STORY IS YOURS ONLY

WHY TO LOOK FOR ANSWERS IN BOOKS THAT TELL OTHER PEOPLE STORIES WHEN THE ANSWERS FOR YOUR STORY LIES IN YOU
HI PROF MY QUESTION IS PHILOSOPHES LIKE SLAVDOM ZIZEL HAVE SAID THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WERE PEOPLE DISCUSS IF RAPE IS RIGHT OR WRONG BUT THAT THESE BASIC HUMAN AGREEMENTS ARE TAKEN AS NOT NECESSARY TO DEBATE BY A COMMUNITY OF I GUESS MORAL HUMAN BEINGS YET MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IS THERE VALIDITY IN ARGUING FOR THE DUTY OF THE PHILOSOPHER TO QUESTION EVERYTHING EVEN THE DARKER SIDES OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR INSTEAD OF JUST SURRENDERING TO THE COMMON CONSENSUS NO MATTER HOW WELL INTENDED IT MAY BE OR WILL THIS SIMPLY SEND US IN AN SPIRAL OF MORAL RELATIVISM
THIS MAY SEEM LIKE A STUPID QUESTION BUT ARE THERE MULTIPLE TYPES OF PHILOSOPHIES I JUST RECENTLY TOOK AN INTEREST IN OTHERS WAY OF LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSE LIFE NATURE ETC
WHAT'S YOUR POSITION ON THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM
HI PROF
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE DUALISTIC VIEW VS THE MONISTIC VIEW ROBERT SOLOMON TALKS ABOUT IN HIS BOOK THE BIG QUESTIONS
GO HUSKIES
DO YOU HAVE ANY FEMALE STUDENT IF YES IN WHICH PERCENTAGE COMPARED TO MALES
REMOVED
HOW SHOULD ONE TELL AN AI WHAT TO DO WELL YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME FORM OF COMMUNICATION THAT BOTH HUMANS AND AIS CAN UNDERSTAND AND THAT IS RICH ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE WHAT ONE WANTS U ULTIMATELY ONE NEEDS A FULL SYMBOLIC DISCOURSE LANGUAGE

I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS

WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO HAVE AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT COULD NOT UNDERSTAND NATURAL LANGUAGE HOW WOULD INTELLIGENCE BE IDENTIFIED IS THIS CASE
IF AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COULD UNDERSTAND THIS FULL SYMBOLIC DISCOURSE LANGUAGE WOULD IT NOT BY THE NATURE OF ITS OWN INTELLIGENCE EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND NATURAL LANGUAGE
WHAT GUARANTEE IS THERE THAT A FULL SYMBOLIC DISCOURSE LANGUAGE WOULD BE USABLE ON THE HUMAN SIDE OF THESE COMMUNICATIONS THE HUMAN PARTICIPANT WOULD HAVE THE SAME KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD AS THE AI PARTICIPANT BUT THIS KNOWLEDGE HAS TO TAKE A PARTICULAR FORM IT HAS TO TAKE A COMMON FORM WITHIN THE FULL SYMBOLIC DISCOURSE LANGUAGE
HOW DO THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS COMMUNICATION NEGOTIATE THE MEANING OF THINGS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN IF THERE IS A MECHANISM TO ADD OR MODIFY MEANINGS IN THIS LANGUAGE HOW DOES ONE PREVENT THESE CHANGES FROM SHIFTING THE COMMON PARADIGM THAT GROUNDS THE LANGUAGE
CAN SOMEONE TL R I READ THE FIRST PAGES AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT POINT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEMS LIKE SOME SEMANTIC BULLSHIT ABOUT WHAT AN INDIVIDUAL I IS

THERE ARE PROPOSED CASES TO A BRAIN BODY BEING DUPLICATED

I DO NOT SURVIVE
2 I SURVIVE AS ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE
I SURVIVE AS BOTH

SO IF WE ASSUME THAT I REFERS TO THE EXISTING SET OF ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH MY PERSON AND SURVIVE REFERS TO THE CONTINUED REPRESENTATION OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES THE OBVIOUS ANSWER SEEMS TO BE A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT TO I SURVIVE IN BOTH OF THE TWO PEOPLE THE DISTINCTION BEING THAT THERE ARE NOW TWO I S AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO SAY THAT I AM TWO PEOPLE RATHER THAN THAT I AM REPRESENTED BY TWO DISTINCT PEOPLE
THIS DISCUSSION THREAD HAS BEEN LOCKED SINCE ALMOST ALL THE COMMENTS RESPOND TO THE TITLE OF THE POST RATHER THAN ITS CONTENT AND THERE SIMPLY IS TOO MUCH OF IT FOR US TO MODERATE
I'VE BEEN IN PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL MOST PEOPLE DON'T CARE OR DON'T GET IT IT'S AN ACQUIRED TASTE I'VE COME TO BELIEVE
I HATE THE THERE IS NO WRONG ANSWER OPEN FORUM TYPE PHILOSOPHY MY HS TAUGHT RATHER THAN TEACHING YOU HOW TO THINK LOGICALLY AND SCRUTINIZE AN ARGUMENT INSTEAD IT'S MORE LIKE ARE WE FREE AND THEN A BUNCH OF YEAR OLDS COMPLAINING THEY CAN'T DO WHAT THEY WANT
PHILOSOPHY IS MANDATORY IN THE LAST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL IN FRANCE I'M NOT SURE IT MAKES A BETTER SOCIETY
SOME OF THE EXAM TOPICS THE FORMAT IS ESSAY NO DOCUMENT ALLOWED HOURS AND YOU'D BETTER COVER ALL POSSIBLE ANSWERS TO GET A DECENT GRADE


IS WORKING LESS LIVING BETTER
DOES ONE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE TO KNOW
DO WE ALWAYS KNOW WHAT WE DESIRE
WHY DO WE HAVE AN INTEREST TO STUDY HISTORY
ARE OUR MORAL CONVICTIONS BASED ON EXPERIENCE
IS DESIRE BY NATURE LIMITED
TO BE JUST IS IT ENOUGH TO FOLLOW THE LAW
CAN WE ALWAYS JUSTIFY OUR BELIEFS


DOES A WORK OF ART ALWAYS HAVE A MEANING
DOES POLITICS ESCAPE THE DUTY TO BE TRUTHFUL
DOES THE INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE ONLY REFLECT THE SOCIETY TO WHICH ONE BELONGS
DO ARTISTS GIVE SOMETHING TO UNDERSTAND
IS RESPECTING ALL LIVING BEINGS A MORAL DUTY
AM I WHAT MY PAST HAS MADE ME

FOR THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE ESSAYS THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHOICE TO COMMENT A TEXT




YEAH AND ALL OF OUR KINGS SHOULD BE PHILOSOPHERS TOO
REMOVED
REMOVED
AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER WHO MAJORED WITH B A IN PHILOSOPHY I HAVE ALWAYS ARGUED THAT THEY SHOULD START TEACHING SIMPLE LOGIC IN 3RD OR 4TH GRADE IT'S ON PAR FOR THE MATHEMATICAL REASONING THEY ARE ASKED TO DO
EXCEPT YOU'D HAVE TO CHANGE THE BASIC SCHOOL STRUCTURE SO AMERICANS COULD UNDERSTAND LOGIC FIRST THEN PHILOSOPHY
DO YOU HAVE A TRANSCRIPT FOR THIS VIDEO NOT INTERESTED IN SITTING THROUGH THAT ROBOT VOICE
I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD WORK OUT AS WELL AS WE MIGHT HOPE IT SEEMS TO ME THERE ARE THREE LIMITING FACTORS

LIMITED TIME THE CLASS COULD ONLY GIVE A VERY SUPERFICIAL GLOSS OF PHILOSOPHY ENOUGH TO COVER THE BASIC SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT AND MOST NOTABLE PHILOSOPHERS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO EXPLORE THEM IN ANY DEPTH
2 COMPLEXITY PHILOSOPHY IS A TREMENDOUSLY COMPLEX SUBJECT WITH MANY DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT VERY SPECIALIZED TERMINOLOGY AND SOMETIMES NO CLEAR ANSWERS
PRIORITIZATION IF YOU CAN'T GET INTO ALL THE PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT WHAT GETS PRIORITIZED GIVEN HOW IMPRESSIONABLE KIDS ARE AND HOW FORMATIVE PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS CAN BE THIS COULD CREATE SOME POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONFLICTS

IT SEEMS TO ME THE CLASS WOULD ALMOST INEVITABLY TURN INTO EITHER A A HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY CLASS FOCUSING ON THE MAJOR PHILOSOPHERS THEIR SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT AND A FEW VERY BASIC CONCLUSIONS THEY REACH OR B A LOGIC CLASS FOCUSING ON FAIRLY BASIC RULES OF LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS

BOTH OF THESE MIGHT BE TREMENDOUSLY VALUABLE BUT THEY ARE MUCH MORE LIMITED IN SCOPE PHILOSOPHY IS TREMENDOUSLY VALUABLE BUT THE COMPLEXITY TIME LIMITS AND STUDENT INTEREST MAY MAKE IT A POOR FIT FOR HIGH SCHOOL
REMOVED
AS SOMEONE WHO MAJORED IN PHILOSOPHY IN COLLEGE I CAN READILY ATTEST THAT PHILOSOPHY CHANGED MY LIFE I THINK IF A VERSION OF IT WERE TAUGHT AS A JUNIOR OR SENIOR LEVEL HIGH SCHOOL COURSE IT COULD GO A LONG WAY FOR OUR SOCIETY

ABOVE ALL ELSE PHILOSOPHY ASKS QUESTIONS FOR WHICH THERE ARE OFTEN NO CLEAR-CUT ANSWERS MANKIND HAS TAKEN IT AS AN IMPERATIVE TO EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN WHETHER THAT'S CHARTING NEW LANDS SCALING MOUNTAINS DIVING DEEP INTO THE OCEANS OR STARING LAUNCHING OURSELVES INTO SPACE PHILOSOPHY IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THESE ENDEAVORS AND THERE IS A PURITY TO IT A VIRTUOUSNESS INTRINSIC TO IT THAT EXPOSES OUR MORE NOBLE NATURES IN A WORLD THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS MORE FOCUS ON THEM

WESTERN CIVILIZATION HAS MORE OF A DUALISTIC NATURE INGRAINED INTO IT THAN DO EASTERN COUNTERPARTS WE'RE OFTEN TAUGHT RIGHT VS WRONG LIGHT VS DARK GOOD VS EVIL BUT MANY OF OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN LIFE ARISE FROM GRAY AREAS PHILOSOPHY EVEN THE INTRODUCTION TO IT TEACHES THE MIND THAT DIFFERENT STANCES CAN HOLD MERIT AGAINST THE SAME OVERRIDING QUESTION IN LIFE WE CONSTANTLY FIND THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE ULTIMATE ANSWER OR FINAL DESTINATION BUT HOW WE GO ABOUT GETTING THERE

IF INTRODUCING THESE EXISTENTIALISM DETERMINISM A GROUP OF YOUNG MINDS COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN EVEN A FEW THEN THE ENDEAVOR IS WORTH IT I DON'T THINK THAT KANT OR PLATO ARE TOO ADVANCED FOR A OR YEAR OLD TO BE ABLE TO GRASP WITH THE PROPER INSTRUCTION
IN MY HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY WAS A SMALL PART OF HISTORY AND LITERATURE CLASSES NOT ALL HIGH SCHOOLS ARE LIKE THIS OF COURSE
HAVING BEEN A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER ONCE UPON A TIME I CAN TEL YOU ONE OF THE THINGS SORELY LACKING IN SYSTEM IS THE ABILITY FOR CRITICAL THINKING UNFORTUNATELY MAKING KIDS ACTUALLY QUESTION THINGS AND NOT LEADING THEM TO BELIEVE THE WORLD IS RAINBOWS UNICORNS CAN BE FOUND OFFENSIVE TO THEIR SENSIBILITIES KIDS ARE TAUGHT TESTS AND THAT IS IT
THE QUEBEC SCHOOL SYSTEM DIFFERS FROM THE REST OF CANADA IN OUR EQUIVALENT OF COLLEGE WE ALREADY HAVE A MANDATORY PHILOSOPHY CLASS I LOVE IT BUT MOST STUDENTS TREAT IT AS POINTLESS WHICH IS A SHAME
I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT WE NEED TO TEACH STATISTICS AND IT'S APPLICATIONS IN OUR WORLD INCLUDING BEING ABLE TO CRITICALLY ASSESS THE INFORMATION WE ARE OFTEN PRESENTED AS FACT BASED ON STUDIES I IMAGINE THE SAME APPLIES TO PHILOSOPHY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BUT I'M NOT A PHILOSOPHER BY ANY STRETCH
TEACHING ANYTHING IN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY THE AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEM IS SHIT EVEN CALLING IT AN EDUCATION SYSTEM IS GIVING IT MORE CREDIT THAN IT DESERVES
CRITICAL THINKING SHOULD BE TAUGHT EVEN BEFORE SCHOOL
OUR HIGH SCHOOL HAS A COLLEGE PHILOSOPHY CLASS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF STUDENTS TAKE
I THINK A CRITICAL THINKING CLASS WOULD BE BETTER

IN HIGH SCHOOL WE SHOULD BE TEACHING KIDS THE BASIC SKILLS THEY NEED TO SURVIVE HOW TO BALANCE A BUDGET MANAGE CREDIT PREPARE A MEAL MAINTAIN A VEHICLE USE BIRTH CONTROL CHANGE A DIAPER APPLY FOR A JOB TAKE CARE OF THEIR BODY ETC

WE SHOULD ALSO BE TEACHING THEM SKILLS THAT WILL HELP THEM FIND A JOB LATER IN LIFE LET'S BRING BACK TYPING CLASSES AND TEACH STUDENTS DATA ENTRY LET'S REQUIRE THEM LEARN HOW TO BE AN ENGINEER ELECTRICIAN WELDER OR MACHINIST

PHILOSOPHY IS AWESOME BUT IT'S A LUXURY WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE EASILY DUPED BY POLITICIANS AND WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE WITH NOTHING TO PUT ON THEIR RESUME BUT AN ARTS DEGREE
I'M ALL FOR IT GET ME STATE FUNDING AND A STATE REQUIREMENT FOR A LOGIC CLASS AN ETHICS CLASS AND A PHILOSOPHY ELECTIVE AND MAKE THE TEACHERS HAVE PHILOSOPHY CERTIFICATION GO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATURES
TEACH BASIC FINANCE AND CIVICS BEFORE THEY WORRY ABOUT SOMETHING EXTRANEOUS LIKE A PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL
OF COURSE THIS IS A TOP POST IN R PHILOSOPHY

LOOK I GET IT PHILOSOPHY IS GREAT

STOP TRYING TO MAKE EVERYONE ELSE LIKE IT AND SHOVE IT DOWN THEIR THROAT SO TO SPEAK WHEN THEY DON'T CARE WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE RADIO OVER HERE PROFESSORS OF PHILOSOPHY ARGUING THAT PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL

YEAH SURE MAYBE BUT I THINK ITS A BIT REDUNDANT COMING FROM A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY OBVIOUSLY YOU THINK THE SUBJECT HAS VALUE BECAUSE YOU'RE INVESTED IN IT WHEN A ROCKET SCIENTIST AN ENTREPRENEUR AND A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER PEOPLE JUMP ON IT I'M IN BUT PLEASE DON'T EXPECT ME TO SIGN UP FOR INTERPRETIVE BASKET WEAVING WHEN THE ONLY ADVOCATES ARE INTERPRETIVE BASKET WEAVERS
TEACHING PHILOSOPHY WOULD BE GREAT AS LONG AS IT'S TAUGHT FOR STUDENTS TO QUESTION THEIR BELIEFS QUESTION THE IDEAS OF VIRTUE ESSENTIALLY TO PROMOTE FREE THINKING
HERE IN SPAIN WE'VE HAD COMPULSORY PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR DECADES IT BECAME JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE SUBJECTS WHERE STUDENTS HAVE TO MEMORISE EVERYTHING AND VOMIT IT IN THE EXAMINATION CONSIDERING THAT PHILOSOPHY OS SUPPOSED TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK BY THEMSELVES AND SEE THE WORLD IN A DIFFERENT WAY IT WAS HORRIBLY FOCUSED AND I SPEAK IN PAST TENSE BECAUSE THE LAST EDUCATIVE REFORM INSTEAD OF FIXING ISSUES OF OUR EDUCATIVE SYSTEM LIKE THIS ONE HAS MADE PHILOSOPHY A MERE OPTATIVE SUBJECT
I'M A PHILOSOPHY PHD STUDENT AT A FAIRLY TOP SCHOOL AND I CANNOT EXPRESS ENOUGH HOW MUCH I AGREE WITH THE TITLE OF THIS POST PHILOSOPHY IS ONE OF THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD SUBJECTS OUT THERE IT IS NOT NOT NOT ABOUT HALF-BAKED IDEAS ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE OR ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE LIVING IN THE MATRIX REAL PHILOSOPHY THAT'S COMMON IN AMERICAN COLLEGES MORESO AT THE INTRODUCTORY LEVEL INVOLVES TOPICS LIKE THE FOLLOWING

WHAT ARE SOME LOGICAL FALLACIES AND HOW CAN YOU AVOID THEM

WHAT'S AN ARGUMENT AND WHAT CONSTITUTES A TO AN ARGUMENT

WHAT ARE THE BEST RULES OF THUMB FOR FORMING BELIEFS AND FOR SAYING THAT YOU KNOW CERTAIN THINGS

WHAT MAKES AN ACTION MORALLY GOOD AND WHAT MAKES ONE MORALLY BAD

ARE SCIENTIST WHO TALK ABOUT TRADITIONALLY PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS GETTING IT RIGHT OR ARE THEY MAKING MISTAKES SOME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS THAT SCIENTISTS TALK UP THESE DAYS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND THE MIND OR CAN SCIENCE TELL US WHAT A MORALLY GOOD ACTION IS

AND ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT WORKING ON SUCH QUESTIONS IS THAT THEY ARE PERFECTLY DESIGNED TO FOSTER IN STUDENTS SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRAITS YOU GET FROM AN EDUCATION AN ABILITY TO DOUBT AND REVISE YOUR OWN IDEAS AN ABILITY TO CRITICIZE ARGUMENTS PROPERLY AN ABILITY TO WRITE CLEARLY AND PERSUASIVELY AN ABILITY TO SPEAK CLEARLY AND PERSUASIVELY MANY OF THESE TRAITS ARE CENTRAL TO AN EDUCATION IN LAW OR MANY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES BUT I THINK PHILOSOPHY IS BEST AT IT PLUS PHILOSOPHY INVOLVES SOME FUN QUESTIONS ABOUT FREE WILL MORAL DILEMMAS CONSCIOUSNESS ETC

CHEERS
PEOPLE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO THINK IN ORDER TO GRASP ANY PHILOSOPHY AND THAT IS THE LAST THING THAT ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE US WISHES TO OCCUR
WHAT IS PHILOSOPHY IF WE'RE TEACHING THEM HOW TO REASON THEN SURE IF WE'RE TALKING WORLD-VIEW MAYBE NOT
OR JUST TEACHING BASIC LOGIC AND REASONING
I NO NO IT WOULDN'T INTERESTED CURIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IN SCHOOL DOESN'T GUARANTEE THE STUDENTS WILL BE CURIOUS INTERESTED OR THOUGHTFUL
SORRY BUT THERE IS NO PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO PHILOSOPHY IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION MATH SCIENCE AND HISTORY DO
EVERYONE IS FULL OF SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM BUT IT'S EXTREMELY RARE FOR THOSE SAME PEOPLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS WE WILL BE TAKING AWAY TO MAKE ROOM
AT THIS RATE TEACHING ANYTHING OF SUBSTANCE WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER AMERICAN SOCIETY
HIGHSCHOOL TEACHES KIDS HOW TO DO AS THEIR TOLD AND NOT QUESTION ANYTHING TEACHERS WANT STUDENTS TO SAY THE SAME ANSWER AND TO BE ONE THERE IS NO THOUGHT PROCESS IN SCHOOL IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF MINDLESS THINKING AND PURE MEMORIZATION WITH NO BUILDING OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE AND COMPREHENSION A HIGHSCHOOL KID WOULD FAIL PHILOSOPHY SO I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD TEACH IT ON A HIGHSCHOOL LEVEL SINCE IT'S BARELY TEACHING AS IT IS THEY SAY THE SAME SCRIPT FOR YEARS AND YEARS
DEPENDS WHAT TYPE OF PHILOSOPHY SEEING THE STATE SOME UNIVERSITIES ARE IN I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU GUYS NEED YOUR HIGH SCHOOLS CHURNING OUT LITTLE MARXISTS
IN AMERICA PHILOSOPHY IS BASICALLY AN ANATHEMA AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR POPULACE MILLION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR AN OPEN FASCIST WHO WANTS TO DO THEM HARM
SO LONG AS YOU TEACH QUALITY ARE YOU TEACHING QUALITY

SORRY IF THAT CAUSES ANYONE TO HAVE A BREAKDOWN HAVE ECT AND BUY A MOTORCYCLE
THERE'S NO PHILOSOPHY SUBJECT IN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS
THEY DO IN MY SCHOOL WE HAVE A LOT OF VARIETY IN OUR COURSE CHOICES
MY SCHOOL DOES THIS IT'S CALLED THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE AND IT'S A REQUIRED PART OF THE IB DIPLOMA
I'D ARGUE THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT WOULD HELP THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM AN INTRODUCTION TO CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY OR EVEN CONTEMPORARY ART AS IT ACTUALLY EXISTS AND RELATES TO THE WIDER CULTURAL CONTEXT OF THE WORLD I E NOT JUST CONSTRUCTION PAPER AND MARKER COMPOSITIONS THAT CAN BE PINNED TO THE FRIDGE THESE SUBJECTS COULD INTRODUCE IDEAS OF PLURALITY SUBJECTIVITY OR EVEN NONSENSE IN A WAY THAT REQUIRES DEEP CRITICAL AND LATERAL THINKING TO RECONCILE WITH THE STUDENTS OWN LIVED EXPERIENCE KNOWING THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF EVER REALLY KNOWING FOSTERS HUMILITY AND EMPATHY IMHO THAN THE MORE POSITIVIST FOCUS OF OTHER SUBJECTS
IN FRANCE THEY HAVE IT IT DOESN'T HELP THE SOCIETY MUCH
I GET A FEELING LIKE SPECIALISTS ALWAYS DREAM OF ACHIEVING SOMETHING IN PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT NOT EVEN THE MAJORITY OF THEIR OWN STUDENTS GET

WHEN SOMEBODY COULD COME UP WITH AN ACTUAL PEDAGOGIC CONCEPT OR CONCRETE CURRICULUM IT WOULD BE EASIER TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY ABOUT HOW EXACTLY IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL

BUT SO FAR MOST OF THESE CALLS TO TEACH SOME NEW SUBJECT ARE RESTRICTED TO I'M SURE THIS WOULD WORK OUT VERY WELL IF ONLY WE HAD SOMEBODY TO DEVELOP A CURRICULUM FOR IT THAT'S AS GREAT AS I IMAGINE IT TO BE
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION PHILOSOPHY WAS TAUGHT AT
I'M FROM PORTUGAL AND HAD MANDATORY PHILOSOPHY FROM 7TH GRADE TO 10TH AND HAD PSYCHOLOGY REGARDLESS IF YOU WERE SPECIFYING IN SCIENCES OR LITERATURE OR ARTS
THEN CRITICAL THINKING
AND A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME MONEY ON THE STUDENT'S SIDE ACADEMIA SCREWED PHILOSOPHY
THEY TAUGHT PHILOSOPHIES IN MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL IN SCOTLAND AS APPOSED TO RELIGIOUS EDUCATION WHICH WE DID GET IN PRIMARY SCHOOL I REMEMBER LEARNING ABOUT THINGS LIKE SECTARIANISM PANOPTICON AND SOME PSYCHOLOGY I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING AND A LOT MORE USEFUL TO KNOW ABOUT RATHER THAN RELIGION

I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO BE TAUGHT ABOUT HOW TO GO ABOUT OUR EVERY DAY LIFE THINGS LIKE MORTGAGES AND LOANS HOW TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL HOW TO PLAN OUR LIVES AND GET WHAT WE WANT OUT OF IT FOCUS MORE ON STUDENT INDIVIDUALITY AND TAILOR CLASSES TO THEIR NEEDS BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE PERSON NATURALLY IS GOING TO EXCEL AT ONE SKILL MORE THAN OTHER PEOPLE ARE EVERYBODY HAS A TALENT I MEAN INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE PLAN FOR EVERY STUDENT TO LEARN FROM SPLIT PEOPLE UP INTO DIFFERENT CLASSES AND SOME CAN HAVE MORE OF A CERTAIN SUBJECT OR WHATEVER TRY AND GET THE BEST OUT OF THE STUDENTS
THE ONE ISSUE WITH THIS LIKE SO MANY FIELDS IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GET BEYOND THE BASIC INTRO CLASSES WHICH CAN BE EXTREMELY BORING SOMETIMES HAVING TO LEARN ABOUT AUTHORS YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
I LOVED THE ONLY PHILOSOPHY CLASS I TOOK IN COLLEGE IT LEFT ME THINKING IN REGARDS TO RELIGION BOTH SIDES HAVE A COMPELLING ARGUMENT WHETHER ITS NO GOD VS GOD OR CATHOLICISM VS BUDDHISM I ALSO FOUND THE DISCUSSIONS ON DUALISM AND ALTRUISM FASCINATING IT IS REALLY NOT ABOUT PROVING GOD EXISTS IT IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT

IT KIND OF RUINED ME THOUGH EVERY TIME I HEAR ATHEISTS AND RELIGIOUS FOLK ARGUING NOW IT SEEMS LIKE 2ND GRADE ARGUMENTS BY BOTH SIDES AND DRIVES ME NUTS
DEPENDS ON THE PHILOSOPHY
IT WOULDN'T MOST PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF DON'T REALLY HAVE AN INTEREST IN IT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T PAY ATTENTION OR TRY AND THAT'S FINE IT'S THEIR CHOICE
I WAS TOUGHT IN SENIOR YEAR WITH ENGLISH
I AGREE FOR THE MOST PART INTRODUCING IT IN A MATHEMATICAL REASONING COURSE WOULD BE SPLENDID AND YOU COULD AT LEAST ARGUE FOR FUNDING MORE EASILY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS SOME ELEMENTS OF SUCH A COURSE BE LESS ABSTRACT AS WELL THAT IS INCLUDE EVERYTHING WE WOULD NORMALLY HAVE IN A MATHEMATICAL REASONING COURSE BUT INSURE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PRESENTED LIKE THE SCHEMATIZATION OF ENGLISH SENTENCES SOMETHING LIKE A DENOTATIONAL SEMANTICS AS WELL AS COVERING FALLACIES WHICH WOULDN'T TAKE THAT LONG TO TEACH THEN JUST TEST KIDS OVER THEM REPEATEDLY UNTIL THEY BEGIN TO DEVELOP AN EYE FOR THEM ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE FALLACY IS CALLED FORMALLY BUT SIMPLY BEING ABLE TO READ HEAR SOMETHING AND RECOGNIZE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE REASONING IS A SUFFICIENT START
USED TO ATTEMPT TO TEACH ETHICS LOST CAUSE

DEAF FROM TOP TO BOTTOM GAVE UP ENTIRELY AFTER A COUPLE YEARS
MY PERSONAL OPINION THEY MUST BE TAUGHT ETHICS AND PATIENTS FOR THEIR BETTER LIVING
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WE'D BE BETTER OFF AS A SOCIETY IF WE TAUGHT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IN HIGH SCHOOLS
THEY DO IT'S AN ELECTIVE
PROBABLY BETTER OFF JUST MAKING EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THE IDEA OF A FORMAL PROOF FIRST CHEAPER AND BETTER BANG FOR BUCK ALSO ACHIEVABLE IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM
THE TEACHER IS THE KEY AMERICAN TEACHERS GET PAID GARBAGE SO QUALITY PHILOSOPHICAL ENGAGEMENT IS UNLIKELY
I WOULD THINK TEACHING PROPER DEBATE SKILLS FIRST WOULD BE NEEDED OTHERWISE IT MIGHT TURN INTO A PISSING MATCH WHEN IT COMES TO DISCUSSIONS OF PHILOSOPHY AND THEN EVERYONE LOSSES
YEAH BUT LET'S BE HONEST PEOPLE WOULD FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE ONLY SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM OF PHILOSOPHY IS TAUGHT EITHER FULL BLOWN LIBERTARIAN OR LIBERALISM DEPENDING ON DISTRICT THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THE MAJORITY OF TEACHERS INTERPRETING IT IN A STRICT DEFINITIVE WAY WHEN OFTEN MUCH PHILOSOPHY IS OPEN TO INTERPRETATION ESPECIALLY WITHOUT HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN MY MIND TO TRULY UNDERSTAND PHILOSOPHY YOU NEED TO BOTH UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY SURROUNDING THE TEXT AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE AUTHOR THAT COMPELLED THEM TO THINK FHST WAY

NO SCHOOL HAS THE TIME TO TEACH THIS AND LETS BE HONEST YOU HAVE TO TEACH TO THE LOWEST DENOMINATOR MANY PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET IT OR CARE TRYING TO READ KANT WAS MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THAN SOME STOCHASTIC MODELING OF BALLISTIC TRAJECTORIES I DO AT WORK

IT'S GOOD STUFF TO LEARN TEACH IT TO YOUR KIDS AT AN EARLY AGE BUT DON'T EXPECT A SINGLE HOUR SCHOOL DAY TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE PHILOSOPHY IS REALLY A LIFELONG READING CURRICULUM
NEEDS TO BE ENCOURAGED AT A MUCH YOUNGER AGE AROUND THE TIME MOST PARENTS ARE OK TALKING ABOUT GOD WE SHOULD BE TEACHING KIDS SOCRATES
TOOK ONE IN COLLEGE AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY DIDN'T CARE THERE AND THE SAME WOULD PROBABLY GO FOR HIGH SCHOOL AS WELL YOU EITHER ARE INTERESTED OR AREN'T FORCING PEOPLE TO TAKE IT WON'T CHANGE THAT
THE QUALITY OF COMMENTS IN THIS THREAD INDICATE THE NEED
AND UNDERSCORE A MAJOR FACET OF DIFFICULTY

BUT THE PRIME DIFFICULTY IS THE INHERENT VIOLENCE POSED BY PHILOSOPHY PEOPLE WHO DEFINE THE CURRICULUM WOULD BE TOO SENSITIVE TO VARIOUS PARENTAL GROUPS EACH INVESTED IN SACRED COWS SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT PHILOSOPHY FOR HIGHSCHOOL WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF ANY PARTICULAR INSTITUTION
THE IRONY IS THAT TEACHING PHILOSOPHY MAKES A BETTER SOCIETY IS ACTUALLY A GREAT PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION
I'M NOT SURE THAT TEACHING PHILOSOPHY WOULD NECESSARILY CREATE A BETTER SOCIETY CONSIDERING THAT THE DEFINITION OF BETTER ITSELF IS BASED ON A SPECIFIC SUBSET OF MORALITY YET PHILOSOPHY ITSELF IS INDIFFERENT TO HOW IT'S USED SOMEONE COULD JUST SIMPLY USE NIHILISM AS A TOOL TO STRENGTHEN THEIR BLOODLUST OR DISREGARD ANY NOTION OF MORALITY OF COURSE THE ASSUMPTION THAT PHILOSOPHY ITSELF IS INDIFFERENT TO HOW IT'S USED IS NIHILISTIC IN ITSELF
HONESTLY WHOEVER POSTED THIS HASN'T A FUCKING CLUE ABOUT TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL
THIS GETS POSTED ONCE A MONTH OR EVERY OTHER MONTH SOME HIGH SCHOOL KID WHO THINKS HE HAS IT TOGETHER AND THAT PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL MAYBE AS AN INDEPENDENT STUDY BUT NOT AS AN ACTUAL CLASSICAL
TEACHING EMPATHY WOULD MAKE FOR AN EVEN BETTER ONE
I FEEL LIKE COMPULSORY CLASSES IN LOGIC WOULD ALSO MAKE FOR A BETTER WORLD
WHY DON'T WE JUST TEACH KIDS BASIC MATH ACCOUNTING AND HOW TO SELL IT WOULD MAKE FOR A PROSPEROUS SOCIETY INSTEAD OF ONE FILLED WITH ZOMBIES WHO ARE BEING TAUGHT TO SERVE OTHERS INSTEAD OF THEMSELVES
MY SCHOOL TEACHES LOGIC FRESHMAN YEAR AND PHILOSOPHY SENIOR YEAR
I THINK LEARNING ABOUT LOGICAL FALLACIES AND HOW TO DEBATE IS MORE IMPORTANT BUT THEN AGAIN WHO CAN BLAME THE TEACHERS FOR NOT WANTING THE STUDENTS TO KNOW HOW TO ARGUE PROPERLY
I TOOK A PHILOSOPHY CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS GREAT ONE KID DID A PRESENTATION ON THE CHURCH OF SATAN TEACHER LOVED IT EVERYONE IN CLASS WAS RESPECTFUL IT WAS A POPULAR ELECTIVE THIS WAS IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL WITH A LARGE STUDENT BODY
ECONOMICS AND LOGIC SHOULD BE REQUIREMENTS TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL
PHILOSOPHY IS NOT TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL
SAYS THE PHILOSOPHER LOOKING FOR QUICK
ALSO BUSINESS CLASSES
IT'S NOT SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE IMO YOU EITHER HAVE IT IN YOU OR YOU DON'T INSTEAD OF MAKING THE SOCIETY A BETTER PLACE TEACHING PHILOSOPHY TO EVERYONE MIGHT SIMPLY RESULT IN A GENERATION OF ARROGANT KNOW-IT-ALL VERYSMARTS
OK MAYBE WE COULD JUST START WITH SEX ED AND BASIC CIVICS
I HAVE TROUBLE TAKING THINGS SPOKEN BY A SHITTY ROBOT VOICE SERIOUSLY PTSD OF FAKE ANONYMOUS PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS INJECTING US WITH TOXINS
IN MY ADULT LIFE STUDYING PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY PARTICULARLY STOICISM AND PSYCHOLOGY HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT FOR GETTING MY THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES I THINK PHILOSOPHY'S REAL VALUE IS HOW IT CAN HELP PEOPLE TO LIVE THEIR LIVES TO THINK AND DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND TO GROW AS PEOPLE IT SOUNDS SIMILAR TO HOW PEOPLE USE RELIGION AND PERHAPS IT IS BUT FOR THOSE OF US WHO GREW UP AS ATHEISTS AND AGNOSTICS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO LEARN PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY AS A HELPFUL AID FOR LIVING ONE'S LIFE AND DEALING WITH EXISTENTIAL QUANDARIES PAIRED WITH THE INSIGHTS FROM PSYCHOLOGY THE TWO FIELDS GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY FOR LIVING A MORE HAPPY LIFE IN THE MODERN WORLD AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE VALUABLE FOR CHILDREN TO LEARN ALTHOUGH A LOT OF THE MESSAGES MAY BE LOST ON THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE AND LACK OF LIFE EXPERIENCE
LETS START WITH THE BASICS FIRST
IN THEORY IT'S A GREAT IDEA IN PRACTICE WHO IS GOING TO BE TEACHING IT
I BELIEVE THE EGO AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE UNIVERSE SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AND EVEN BE INCORPORATED AS A CENTRAL ELEMENT IN SCIENCE CLASSES BUT MPH SKY GOD PREVENTS THAT WHAT IS THE POINT IN HIDING THIS STUFF ANYWAYS
PHILOSOPHY IS TAUGHT EVERYWHERE OUTSIDE THE US WE DON'T HAVE BETTER SOCIETIES BUT YOU'LL HAVE A LOT OF NEW TEACHING JOBS TO BE FILLED
MY HIGH SCHOOL RECENTLY GOT A PHILOSOPHY CLASS
IF YOU TEACH TO SUBJECTS THAT WOULD HAVE SOCIETAL BENEFIT LIKE MORAL ARGUMENTS

THOSE SUBJECTS HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT OF NOT MAKING ME WANT TO RIP OUT MY EYES
SPANISH HERE WE USED TO HAVE AT LEAST 2 YEARS OF PHILOSOPHY NOW OUR GOVERMENT THINKS IT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE SO THEY ARE CUTTING HOURS I GUESS THE DUMBER THE BETTER
BEST COURSE THAT HAS HAD THE MOST IMPACT ON MY LIFE THAT I TOOK IN COLLEGE WAS HANDS DOWN PHILOSOPHY I DEFINITELY THINK IT SHOULD BE A REQUIRED CLASS AT SOME POINT I JUST TOOK IT ON A WHIM AND I'M SO GLAD I DID
BETTER SOCIETY FOR WHOM THE GOAL OF THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IS NOT TO MAKE YOU GREAT IT'S TO MAKE YOU A FACTORY WORKER
HERE IN QUEBEC PHILOSOPHY IS TAUGHT IT'S MORE THE TEACHING PUSHING IS IDEA ON YOU THAN ANYTHING ELSE MY EXPERIENCE ALSO GOES THAT WAY FIRST CLASS THE TEACHER WAS AWESOME LET US DEBATE TRY TO EXPLAIN IS GROUND BUT THE NEXT TWO CLASS WERE TOTAL SHIT TEACHER WANTED YOU TO WRITE THEIR OPINION IN YOUR ESSAYS AND YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE IN FACT MY COUSIN HAVE A MAJOR IN PHILOSOPHY AND HE BASICALLY DO MY LAST ESSAY AND SHE GAVE ME A

PS WE WERE FREE TO GET HELP
AND TEENAGERS WOULD BE SO UNBEARABLY PRETENTIOUS
CAN WE ADD ECONOMICS AND GOVERNMENT TO THIS LIST FOR FEAR OF SOUNDING LIKE I HAVE MY TIN FOIL HAT ON THE ARGUMENT THAT GOVERNMENT DOES IT WANT US TO KNOW IT OR FINANCE WORKS SEEMS CONVINCING WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW LITTLE WE ARE TAUGHT ABOUT IT
SEEMS LESSONS IN CRITICAL THINKING LONG BEFORE HIGH SCHOOL COULD HELP
THIS WOULD ONLY LEAD TO A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS TRYING TO USE PHILOSOPHY TO JUSTIFY DISSENT OR JUST SUCK EACH OTHERS TOES
AWESOME MORE PEOPLE TELLING TEACHERS HOW TO DO THEIR JOB DESPITE HAVEN'T HAVING BEEN IN A CLASSROOM IN DECADES EDUCATION IS NOT ABOUT DUMPING CONTENT THAT YOU WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO KNOW EDUCATION IS ABOUT AWAKING CRITICAL THINKING AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION GO AWAY AND DON'T TELL EDUCATION WHAT TO DO AGAIN

AND BTW PHILOSOPHY IS TAUGHT IT'S MOSTLY LOST ON THE KIDS BUT WHEN TAUGHT BY A GOOD TEACHER IT CAN BE WORTHWHILE USUALLY IT'S JUST A WASTE OF TIME
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT LOGIC IS THE MORE IMPORTANT PART MOST PHILOSOPHY COURSES NOW ARE JUST THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY

I WOULD LIKE SCHOOLING TO TEACH THE IMPORTANT TRAITS OF LOGIC COMPASSION CHARISMA AND AMBITION BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ALL THOSE YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE SUCCESSFUL
I HAD ETHICS AND RELIGION CLASSES THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL AND PHILOSOPHY CLASSES IN CHEEP WHICH IS BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY HERE IN CANADA EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO STUDY PAST HIGH SCHOOL HAS TO GO THROUGH AT LEAST PHILOSOPHY CLASSES

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED PHILOSOPHY BUT MOST PEOPLE I KNEW THOUGHT IT WAS USELESS AND THE DUMBEST CLASS EVER I THINK MOST PEOPLE HAVE A FIXED PHILOSOPHY ON LIFE ACQUIRED THROUGHOUT CHILDHOOD AND NO ABILITY TO CHANGE IT WHATSOEVER SO PHILOSOPHY RIGHTFULLY GOES OVER THEIR HEADS
WILL TEACHING PHILOSOPHY MAKE THE STUDENT WHO SITS IN THE BACK DISRUPTING CLASS CARE TEACHERS I'VE KNOWN ALL HAVE ONE PROBLEM THERE ARE KIDS WHO DON'T GIVE HALF A FUCK AND MAKE LIFE HARD FOR THE CLASSICAL THEY EARN A BAD GRADE AND THEY DON'T CARE YOU CALL THEIR PARENTS AND THE PARENTS DON'T CARE YOU SEND THEM TO DISCIPLINE AND THEY DON'T CARE THEY GET SUSPENDED AND THEY THINK IT'S A FREE DAY OFFICIAL AT THE END IF THE DAY THE WAY TO MAKE SCHOOLS BETTER IS TO MAKE THE JOB OF TEACHING A BETTER JOB THAT ATTRACTS BETTER PEOPLE IF THE SMALL SAMPLE OF TEACHERS I KNOW ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LARGER WHOLE THEN A GOOD FIRST STEP IS FINDING A WAY TO REMOVE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR POURING THIS BEHAVIOR IN A PHILOSOPHY CLASS WON'T HELP ANYONE
MOST HIGH SCHOOL KIDS AREN'T MATURE OR INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE ANY REAL PHILOSOPHY AT LEAST IN THE U SOUTH AND THIS IS GETTING WORSE EVERY YEAR

I THINK THOUGH THAT KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD AT LEAST BE INTRODUCED TO PHILOSOPHY AND IF THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN IT THEY CAN TAKE AN ELECTIVE COURSE ON IT
MY HIGH SCHOOL OFFERED A SPECIAL TOPICS CLASS THAT WAS DESIGNED AS AN ELECTIVE WHERE STUDENTS COULD DISCUSS WHATEVER THEY WANTED IT WAS TAUGHT MORE LED OR GUIDED BY A THOUGHTFUL PROFESSOR WITH A LIGHT-HANDED TEACHING STYLE THE CLASS BEGAN AS SOME POSTS HAVE PREDICTED A BUNCH OF GUARDED SELF-OBSESSED GRADERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR LIVES BUT AS THE STUDENTS GREW MORE COMFORTABLE AROUND EACH OTHER AND WITH NUDGING FROM THE PROFESSOR IT EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING LIKE AN INTRO PHILOSOPHY OR ETHICS CLASSICAL IT WASN'T AS RIGOROUS AS THE PHILOSOPHY ETHICS COURSES I TOOK IN COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL AND THE PROFESSOR DIDN'T CARE ABOUT TYING THEORIES TO NAMES OR TESTING US ON WHAT WE HAD LEARNED BUT THAT DID NOT STOP THE COURSE FROM EXPOSING OUR NARROW TEENAGE MINDS TO POWERFUL NEW CONCEPTS AND THAT WE COULD EXPLORE WITH OUR PEERS IN A CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT THAT WITH TIME FELT RELATIVELY SAFE MAYBE BEST OF ALL SPECIAL TOPICS WAS A REGULARS COURSE AS OPPOSED TO AN HONORS COURSE AND I WAS FASCINATED BY THE WAYS THAT A DIVERSE GROUP OF STUDENTS WOULD ANALYZE OR NOT THE CONCEPTS THAT WE DISCUSSED

YEARS LATER THIS IS THE CLASS THAT I REMEMBER MOST VIVIDLY FROM HIGH SCHOOL IT TAUGHT ME AS MUCH ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES THAT PEOPLE HOLD AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY WHY THEY HOLD THEM AS LATER MORE FORMAL PHILOSOPHY AND ETHICS CLASSES AND IT WAS INCREDIBLE TO HAVE AN EARLY INTRODUCTION TO AS THE VIDEO PUTS IT THE POSSIBILITY THAT I WAS WRONG IN MANY OF THE VIEWS THAT I HELD I DON T KNOW WHETHER A RIGOROUS HIGH SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY CLASS WOULD BE DOOMED TO FAIL BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY SUPPORT A PHILOSOPHY LITE COURSE
PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE FOR PEOPLE OVER
IF YOU WANT TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL YOU NEED TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS MUCH EARLIER THAN WHEN STUDENTS ARE ALREADY TEENAGERS THE HABITS THEY FORM IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL INCLUDING THEIR THOUGHT PROCESSES ARE FULLY INGRAINED IT TAKES YEARS TO TEACH A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT TO BE A COMPETENT STUDENT BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY TEACH THEM COMPLICATED STUDIES FOR THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS

SERIOUS FRESHMEN YEAR SOCIAL STUDIES HAS BASICALLY BECOME A BASIC TRAINING CAMP IN WHICH WE STUDENTS TO THINK THAT SHOWING UP TO SCHOOL AND TURNING IN BARELY COMPLETED HOMEWORK IN THE PATH TO AN A WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY SPEND TIME AT HOME STUDYING TO PREPARE FOR A TESTAMENT WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM TO BE ABLE TO ASK A QUESTION

AND THROUGH THEORETICAL PHILOSOPHY AT THAT NOT UNTIL THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ARE NO LONGER ROTE MEMORIZATION AND FULL CREDIT FOR PARTICIPATION


THIS GENERATION DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT WHAT STOICISM IS
WE SHOULD START TEACHING MORE RESPECT MANNERS AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
DELETED

WHAT IS THIS
I WOULD GO FOR A ROUNDER CLASS WITH ART AND MUSIC THROWN IN
I DON'T KNOW HALF-BAKED PHILOSOPHIES ARE THE REASON FOR A LOT OF SUFFERING
WHAT SHOULD REALLY BE TAUGHT IS LOGICAL THINKING
AS A COLLEGE FACULTY MEMBER WHO IS CURRENTLY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND WHO HAS ALSO SPENT MANY HOURS ON THE BUREAUCRATIC SIDE OF OUR PROGRAM TO DEVELOP IT I CAN SAY THAT IT IS MUCH EASIER SAID THAN DONE

WHAT WORKS MOST AGAINST PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOLS IS HOW HIGH SCHOOLS AND MANY COLLEGES NOW ARE APPROACHING EDUCATION ONCE YOU HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM WHERE LEARNING OUTCOMES MUST BE QUANTIFIED AND THE STUDENTS ARE USED TO APPROACHING LEARNING IN THIS WAY IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY MEANINGFULLY

ONCE YOU GET PAST THAT HURDLE YOU HAVE THE BUREAUCRATIC HURDLE OF FIGURING OUT WHAT CLASS TO REMOVE AND REPLACE WITH PHILOSOPHY RIGHT NOW WE'RE AN ELECTIVE IN ALL OF OUR PROGRAM SCHOOLS WHICH IS PROBABLY THE BEST PHILOSOPHY WILL EVER BECOME BUT WHEN YOU'RE AN ELECTIVE YOU'RE FIGHTING AGAINST THE OTHER ELECTIVES AND THE STUDENTS SIMPLY USING THAT PERIOD AS A STUDY HALL GIVEN HOW MUCH MINDLESS BUSY WORK THE SCHOOLS ARE NOW GIVING THE KIDS IF I WERE A PARENT OF A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT I'D DISCOURAGE THEM FROM TAKING ANY ELECTIVES AND HAVE THEM JUST USE THAT TIME FOR A STUDY HALL
TEACH LOGIC DON'T BOTHER WITH THE REST
QUITE THE OPPOSITE I STUDIED THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS AND A FEW NOT SO GREAT MOST OF IT IS PSYCHOBABBLE THAT IS VERY CIRCULAR IN NATURE AND WORKS LIKE TELLING SOMEONE THE ATTRIBUTES OF THEIR SIGN OR READING A FORTUNE COOKIE THEY SUPERIMPOSE SOME VERY GENERAL AND NEBULOUS STATEMENT ABOUT AN OBSERVATION ONTO THEM SELF QUITE LIKE THE WAY PEOPLE SEE ELEPHANTS IN CLOUDS

DON'T MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT SOMEONE IS NOT KNOWLEDGEABLE IN SUBJECT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT COME TO THE SAME OPINION AS YOU
ISN'T PHYSICS BASICALLY PHILOSOPHY A CLASS
AND BETTER MUSIC
I THINK TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IN ALL COUNTRIES FROM A YOUNG AGE WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS RELIGION CLASS WHICH JUST AIDS SEGREGATION AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED SETS UP DIVIDES AND DIFFERENCES PHILOSOPHY CLASS WOULD BREED KIDS WHO ACTUALLY ASK QUESTIONS AND NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL MY ENGLISH CLASSES WERE BASICALLY PHILOSOPHY AND IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WELL YOU WANNA KNOW WHY CAUSE IT'S A BUNCH OF TEENAGE IDIOTS WHO ONLY INDULGE IN INSTANT GRATIFICATION AND CANNOT SEE THE LONG TERM BENEFITS OF LOGICAL THINKING LET'S BE HONEST HERE AT THAT AGE HOW MANY KIDS ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT PHILOSOPHY AT ALL AND EVEN IF THEY DO CARE DO THEY HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT IN MY CLASSES EITHER HONORS OR AP ONLY A FEW PASSIONATE BRIGHT STUDENTS GOT SOMETHING OUT OF IT THE MAJORITY JUST DICKED AROUND AND BULLSHITTED THEIR WAY OUT OF IT MY TEACHERS WERE ACTUALLY SO DEPRESSED THAT THE STUDENTS DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT THAT TWO OF THEM QUIT TEACHING ENGLISH ALTOGETHER THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE NOWADAYS LET ALONE KIDS WHO ENJOY THAT KIND OF DEEP THINKING THERE ARE SO MANY DISTRACTIONS ALL AROUND US AND WHILE TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IT'S PRACTICAL MAJOR CHANGES WOULD HAVE TO OCCUR FOR IT TO WORK
THE LAST THING WE NEED IS MORE LITTLE THINKING THEY HAVE ALL ANSWERS TRYING TO FIT THE WORLD INTO THEIR NARROW IDEOLOGY BECAUSE THEY READ A FEW PAGES FROM A BOOK ABOUT PHILOSOPHY

READ PHILOSOPHY ON YOUR OWN TIME KIDS

TEACHING SCIENCE IN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY
DELETED
HOW DO YOU TEACH THE LOVE OF WISDOM IN AN OPPRESSIVE SYSTEM THAT MUST TAILOR ITSELF TO THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR
TEACHING SHOP HOME ECONOMICS PROPER DIET AND EXERCISE AND HOW TO HANDLE CREDIT AND NOT GO INTO DEBT WOULD BE A DAMN SIGHT BETTER

OH AND WELCOME TO THE FRONT PAGE
SO WOULD TEACHING ART AND MUSIC SO WOULD TEACHING HOME ECONOMICS OR HOME AND CONSUMER SCIENCES SO WOULD EFFECTIVELY TEACHING DEBATE AND CRITICAL THINKING SO WOULD TEACHING MATH AND SCIENCE IN AN APPLICABLE FORMAT RATHER THAN JUST TEACHING HOW TO PASS A STANDARDIZED TESTAMENT AMERICAN SCHOOLS ARE IN FREE FALL AND THE PEOPLE WITH THE POWER TO CHANGE THEM FOR THE BETTER KEEP TAKING MORE AND MORE MONEY OUT OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM
MAKING WORLD RELIGION A MANDATORY CLASS AND PAYING THE TEACHER THE SAME AS A FOOTBALL COACH WOULD ALSO LEAD TO A MUCH BETTER AND MORE TOLERANT WORLD
SIR THAT ALL WHO ARE HAPPY ARE EQUALLY HAPPY IS NOT TRUE A PEASANT AND A PHILOSOPHER MAY BE EQUALLY SATISFIED BUT NOT EQUALLY HAPPY HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN THE MULTIPLICITY OF AGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS A PEASANT HAS NOT THE CAPACITY FOR HAVING EQUAL HAPPINESS WITH A PHILOSOPHER SAMUEL JOHNSON
NOT REALLY SURE WHY THIS WAS SUBMITTED IN THIS FORM NO ATTRIBUTION TO THE AUTHOR EITHER HERE IS THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE


WHY IS IT ONLY NECESSARY FOR AMERICA I WANT PHILOSOPHY LESSONS TOO BRITISH LIVES MATTER
ARE YOU KIDDING THE GOP RUN RED STATES ARE BANNING SCIENCE DO YOU THINK THESE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS WHO WANT BOOKS TO ARGUING THAT JESUS WALKED WITH DINOSAURS ARE GOING TO SUPPORT FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
IF OUR SCHOOLS WEREN'T CONTROLLED BY MARXISTS I'D BE ON BOARD WITH IT
IT ISN'T A MANDATORY CLASS THERE
TELL THAT TO TEXAS WHERE THEY MAKE THEIR OWN STORIES IN BOOKS AND TEACH KIDS
WAIT YOU DON'T STUDY PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL FOR US IT'S NORMAL BUT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH IN ITALY AND WE HAVE DIFFERENTLY ORIENTED SCHOOLS BUT ALL LET'S SAY HIGH LEVEL WHERE YOU GO IF YOU WANT TO STUDY MORE VS OTHERS WERE YOU LEARN A LOT OF PRACTICAL SUBJECTS HAVE PHILOSOPHY EVEN ONES
IT DEPENDS ON IF THEY TAUGHT MODERN TRASH OR ARISTOTLE AQUINAS AND AYN RAND
TOO LATE NOW SOCIETY IS ALL KINDS OF SCREWED UP AT THIS POINT I DOUBT IT'S FIXABLE WITHOUT MAJOR REFORMS TO EVERYTHING WE ARE IN THE DOWNWARDS SPIRAL
AFTER TAKING JUST ONE SEMESTER OF PSYCHOLOGY IN HIGH SCHOOL WITH EVEN JUST THAT BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE HUMAN MIND WORKS IT GAVE ME SO MUCH INSIGHT AS TO HOW AND WHY I AND OTHER PEOPLE THINK A CERTAIN WAY AFTER TAKING IT I FELT LIKE IT SHOULD BE A REQUIRED CLASS BECAUSE EVERYONE WOULD SIMPLY BE MORE UNDERSTANDING OF THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER IF EVERYONE KNEW SOME BASIC PSYCHOLOGY
MADE IT TWO SENTENCES IN MAYBE START OUT A BIT LESS PRETENTIOUS AND ZIETGIESTY NEXT TIME
PHILOSOPHY IS TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE RELY ON ARROGANCE DECEPTION HYPOCRISY WHICH DOES NOT YIELD AN OUTCOME THAT ANYONE VALUES

A MORE USEFUL APPROACH MUST START WITH HONESTY UNFLINCHING UNCONDITIONAL UNMERCIFUL HONESTY FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS OF OTHER APPROACHES ARE ROOTED IN DISHONESTY THE KIDS WILL ALWAYS DISCOVER YOUR DECEPTIONS AFTER WHICH THEY NEVER AGAIN GRANT THEIR CONFIDENCE TO YOUR REASON OR ELOQUENCE
ACTUAL TEACHING WOULD LEAD TO A BETTER SOCIETY

EDIT THAT'S NOT AN ATTACK ON PHILOSOPHY BY THE WAY IT'S AN ATTACK ON THE CURRENT STANDARD TEST SYSTEM
IN NORWAY WE USED TO HAVE A SUBJECT CALLED CHRISTENDOM MEANING CHRISTIANITY THEN THEY CHANGED IT TO KARL MEANING CHRISTIANITY RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY

VERY RECENTLY IT CHANGED TO RLE RELIGION SPIRITUALITY AND ETHICS

I AM WILLING TO BET EVERYTHING I OWN THAT IN A COUPLE OF YEARS IT WILL CHANGE TO BLER PHILOSOPHY SPIRITUALITY ETHICS AND RELIGION
I BEEN SAYING
THAT WOULDN'T MAKE GOOD WORKER DRONES THOUGH
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY OUR CAPITALIST OVERLORDS WOULD NEVER ALLOW IT
I GOT ONE WORD MEDITATION
CRITICAL THINKING AND SKEPTICAL THINKING SKILLS WOULD BE MORE USEFUL THAN MOST OF PHILOSOPHY

FIGURING OUT WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG IS LESS USEFUL THAN FIGURING OUT WHAT'S LIKELY AND WHAT'S UNLIKELY
YEAH GET A BUNCH OF SHELTERED KIDS AND GIVE THEM THE IDEA THAT THEY CAN FIX SOCIETY NOBODY IS BETTER SUITED TO THE TASK OF COMING UP WITH THE PERFECT FORM OF GOVERNMENT SOCIETY THAN A BUNCH OF ANGST TEENAGERS WITH NO REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE WHO HAVE ALL OF THEIR NEEDS PROVIDED FOR THEM BY THEIR PARENTS AND WHOSE ONLY WINDOW INTO THE REST OF THE WORLD IS POP CULTURE YUP THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA JUST DON'T FORGET TO TELL THEM THAT THERE'S NO WRONG ANSWERS AND THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD THAT WAY THEY'LL LEAVE THE CLASS THINKING NOT ONLY THAT THEY'RE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO HARASS AND SPAZ OUT ON ANYONE WHO TRIES TO IGNORE THEM OR DISAGREES WITH THEM

EDIT NOT TO MENTION THE TEACHERS IF YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT THE TEACHERS WOULDN'T HIJACK THESE CLASSES AND TURN THEM INTO THEIR OWN LITTLE RE-EDUCATION SEMINARS THEN MAN OH MAN YOU ARE NAIVE
YES STUDY PLATO OR EVEN SALON THE LAW GIVER
I TOOK PHILOSOPHY FIRST TWO YEARS OF UNI BEST CLASSICAL EVER
THOUGH I DON'T AGREE IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY
DOUBT IT ON THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE IN HIGH SCHOOL DONT GIVE A SHIT AND TEACHING THEM ACTUAL CONCEPTS LIKE EXISTENTIALISM WHERE NOTHING MATTERS ONLY REINFORCES THAT CONCEPT
OKAY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PERFECT WORLD THINGS YEAH IT WOULD BE NICE BUT IN HIGH SCHOOL PEOPLE DONT GIVE A SHIT PERSONALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY CONSIDERING ONLY A FEW PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY CARE
TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS WOULD MAKE FOR AN INQUISITIVE SOCIETY YOU CAN'T DO THAT HERE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THIS WORKS
I JOINED A PHILOSOPHY CLUB IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS PRETTY FUN AND ENLIGHTENING AND IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST TAUGHT AS AN ELECTIVE
LETS MAKE SURE KIDS CAN BALANCE AN EQUATION AND ARE LITERATE
PHILOSOPHY IS ADVANCED LOGIC LOGIC IS MATHEMATICS OUR STUDENTS ARE BARELY COMPREHENDING IN THE WORLD ARE THEY GOING TO GET TO PHILOSOPHY
MAYBE I'D RATHER PHILOSOPHY THAT ART OR SOME OF THE LESS USEFUL CLASSES IT DOES TEACH PEOPLE TO THINK CRITICALLY WHICH IS A SKILL MANY LACK

I DO WORRY THAT IT MIGHT DEGRADE INTO REGRESSIVE LIBERAL AND I WOULD PREFER WE HAVE MORE STEM CLASSES IF ANYTHING
IT WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY IF PEOPLE NOT ONLY GRASPED IT BUT WE'RE ABLE TO THINK BACK ON IT AND IMPLEMENT THE TEACHING IN THEIR DAILY LIFE TO UNDERSTAND IT IS ONE THING TO USE IT IS ANOTHER OFTEN TIMES IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT YOU WON'T THINK OF THE LITTLE MANTRAS TO CONTROL YOURSELF OR YOUR THOUGHTS IN THE SITUATION
PORTUGUESE HERE WE HAVE 2 YEARS OF PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL NOBODY CARES ABOUT IT AND IT'S THE CLASS EVERYBODY FAILS AT
IT BLEW MY MIND HOW MANY PEOPLE IN PHILOSOPHY WHICH WAS ALL ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF AN ARGUMENT CONDITIONS ETC WOULD REFUSE TO LEARN FORMAL LOGIC AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY COMMON FALLACIES WERE FALLACIES NO TRUE SCOTSMAN IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMMON FALLACY THAT I SEE PEOPLE MAKE DAILY
TEACHING ABOUT TAXES AND JOB APPLICATIONS MIGHT BE BETTER
OUR LEADERS DO NOT WANT A SOCIETY THEY WANT THEIR SLAVES BACK
I THINK INTRODUCING PHILOSOPHY INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM WOULD BENEFIT SOCIETY MORE THAN IT IMPEDES IT BUT WITHOUT HAVING THE INTRODUCTION OF CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS AND ETHICS AT ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY LEVELS OF EDUCATION BEING APPLIED IT'S SIMILAR TO TELLING SOMEBODY HOW TO BUILD A WATCH WHEN ALL THEY REALLY NEED IS TO KNOW IS THE TIME
ALSO SANSKRIT PLENTY OF SANSKRIT
I THINK COURSES IN ETHICS AND CIVICS WOULD HAVE A BETTER IMPACT
YEAH NUMBER NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT IMPORTANT BUT THAT A MOST HIGH SCHOOL KIDS DON'T CARE AND B SCHOOLS DON'T DO A GOOD JOB IN TEACHING STUFF KIDS WILL ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE LIKE HOW TO MANAGE THEIR PERSONAL FINANCES
I WOULD ARGUE THAT MUCH OF WHAT IS TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL IS DRAWN FROM PHILOSOPHY WESTERN CULTURE HAS A HISTORY OF TAKING THE MOST USEFUL CONCEPTS FROM PHILOSOPHY AND PUTTING THEM IN SOME OTHER DISCIPLINE AND DECLARING THIS ISN'T PHILOSOPHY ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S DEMONSTRABLY APPLICABLE TO THE REAL WORLD
WHAT WE NEED IS PEOPLE TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND FOR PARENTS TO STOP BEING SHITTY OF PROBLEMS IN HIGH SCHOOLS ARE DUE TO THIS
AND SOCIOLOGY AND OTHER LIBERAL ARTS PROGRAMS SAVE ADVANCED MATHS FOR COLLEGE WHEN PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED ON A CAREER THAT WOULD REQUIRE IT SOCIETY IS NOT IMPROVED BY HAVING A HIGH OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW CALCULUS BUT NEVER USE IT
ALL TOO OFTEN IN MY PHILOSOPHY CLASSES IT TURNED INTO THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND

IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT WHO HAS IT FIGURED OUT THE MOST WHICH IS ALMOST NEVER ANYONE INCLUDING ME
TO TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER I THINK A FEW THINGS WOULD MAKE AMERICANS BETTER PEOPLE

REQUIRE A FOREIGN LANGUAGE TO GRADUATE AND HAVE CULTURAL LESSONS ON THAT LANGUAGE'S REGION MY SPANISH CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL WERE GREAT LIKE THAT BUT NOT ALL STATES REQUIRE A LANGUAGE TO GRADUATE

2 HAVE A WORLD RELIGIONS CLASS WHERE RELIGIOUS LEADERS OF EACH MAJOR GROUP COME IN FOR A FEW WEEKS EACH AND TEACH THEIR LESSON BEING ABLE TO SEE THE PERSPECTIVE OF A MUSLIM IMAM A SATANIST A ATHEIST ETC MAY HELP US STOP DRAWING LINES BETWEEN PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS

FORCED COMMUNITY SERVICE WORK WHILE IN SCHOOL I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A BEACH CLEAN UP I'M SAYING THAT THEY MUST WORK WITH THOSE IN POVERTY TO HELP LIFT THEM UP FEEDING THEM TEACHING TUTORING THEM TO PASS THE GRE ETC MOST KIDS GRADUATE SCHOOL WITHOUT EVER WORKING FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN A LETTER GRADE AND STANDARDIZED TESTAMENT
TEACHING THE TRUTH WOULD TOO
AT DOES HE SAY PRAZERAS IF SO HE IS MY AP WORLD HISTORY TEACHER WHO OFTEN TALKS ABOUT PHILOSOPHY IN OUR CLASS OUR HIGH SCHOOL DOESN'T TEACH PHILOSOPHY I'M ASKING THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT COULD BE A QUOTE FROM MY TEACHER
WHAT SUBJECT WOULD IT REPLACE
ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY SENTENTIAL LOGIC SCRUTINIZING NEWS AND RECOGNIZING LOGICAL FALLACIES SPECIFICALLY AND THE VALUE AND PRACTICE OF THE SOCRATIC METHOD

INSTEAD WE GET NITPICKED HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY AND THEORIES OUT OF CONTEXT AND WITHOUT THE RIGOR REQUIRED TO DERIVE THEM
AS MY PHILOSOPHY DOCTOR IN COLLEGE HAS TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU THIS SHIT IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SCARE YOUR LITTLE WEAK MINDS
NOT AS MUCH AS CLASSES IN HOME ECONOMICS WOULD
MY HIGHSCHOOL PHILOSOPHY CLASS WAS TAUGHT BY THE BEST TEACHER I THINK I'LL EVER HAVE I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR THAT MAN AND HIS CLASS WAS GREAT I THOUGHT ALL HIGH SCHOOLS HAD PHILOSOPHY AS AN ELECTIVE THEY DO HERE WHERE I AM IN GEORGIA
I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY THE TEACHING SHOULD BE INTENDED TO PROMOTE THE EXPANSION OF PHILOSOPHY I EAST I LEARN ABOUT LET'S SAY THE HOLOCAUST SO EVERYONE CAN SORT OF RELATE FROM WHAT I STUDY I'LL BEGIN OR COMPILE ON TO MY UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS LIKE GENOCIDE WAR PROPAGANDA TOLERANCE WHAT WE CALL LEFTIST AND WHAT WE CALL RIGHT HOW HATE CAN SPREAD EVEN TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THEY ARE ENGAGING IN SUCH AND PERSONALLY I THINK THIS SUB HAS A HIGH HORSE KIND OF ATTITUDE WHEN IT COMES TO TALKING ABOUT HOW IT'S THOUGHT THAT THE MAJORITY OR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T CARE ABOUT PHILOSOPHY ARE THINKING PROCESSING THOUGHTS AND UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD THEY LIVE IN IT'S REALLY JUST TO DISREGARD THE SOPHISTICATION OF MANY PEOPLE JUST BECAUSE THEY AREN'T ENGAGED IN DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN OR SIMPLY WANT TO BE TAKEN OR TAKE LIFE LESS SERIOUSLY DOESN'T MEAN ALL OF THAT SOPHISTICATION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THE REST OF YOU IGNORE ISN'T IN THERE
THAT'S WHAT ENGLISH CLASSES ARE FOR
I ATTENDED AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THAT WAS PHILOSOPHY BASED AND IT WOULD BE IDEAL TO SEND MY CHILD TO A SIMILAR SCHOOL WHEN I HAVE A KID
I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO TAKE PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULD ALSO HAVE LOVED TO HAVE HAD THEOLOGY OFFERED AS A HIGH SCHOOL COURSE I THINK TO MANY KIDS DON'T REALLY GET EXPOSED TO BELIEFS OTHER THAN THERE FAMILY RELIGION TILL AN OLDER AGE
THEY ALREADY REQUIRE IT IN MY HIGH SCHOOL

WHILE MY SCHOOL DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY HAVE A PHILOSOPHY CLASS THEY WERE FOCUSED ON TEACHER CRITICAL THINKING HOW TO WRITE CRITICAL ESSAYS HOW TO DECODE PARAGRAPHS TO GET THE MAIN POINT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO MAKE CONSIDERING THEY ONLY HAVE LIKE A DROP OUT RATED THINK IT WORKS OUT WELL

NOT EVERYONE LIKES PHILOSOPHY AND I COULD SEE SOMETHING LIKE EPISTEMOLOGY TO BE TRIGGERING IN THIS DAY AND AGE CAUSING KIDS TO HAVE AN INTERNAL CRISIS LOL
I AGREE WITH THE TOP COMMENT MOST STUDENTS WOULDN'T GET IT OR CARE

MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY SHOULD TEACH ACTUAL HISTORY RATHER THAN PROPAGANDA
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT GAVE US SOME BASICS IN PHILOSOPHY I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT THROUGH COLLEGE OR LIFE REALLY WITHOUT IT
THIS ONLY THE TIME THIS OPINION HAS BEEN POSTED IN THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS
REMOVED
ACTUALLY TEACHING IN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS WOULD BE NICE RATHER THAN JUST PROGRAMMING STUDENTS TO DO WELL ON STANDARDIZED TESTS
TEACHING PHYSICS AS A SUBJECT EARLY ON WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY
I THINK SOME BASIC RHETORIC AND FORMAL LOGIC CLASSES WOULD DO A LOT BUT PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL MIGHT BE A BIT OF A STRETCH
RESPECTFULLY I REMAIN UNCONVINCED IN THEORY THE ARGUMENT MAKES GOOD SENSE BUT THE EMPIRICS OF THE MATTER MUDDY THE WATERS CONSIDERABLY FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE CONTINUES TO BE A SOCIETY THAT IN SPITE OF TEACHING PHILOSOPHY FROM GRADE SCHOOL THROUGH LYCEE HIGH SCHOOL HAS ARGUABLE MORE PROBLEMS THAN EVEN THE US AND TENDS TO INTELLECTUALIZE SOCIAL PROBLEMS TO A FAULT RATHER THAN FIND PRACTICAL AND EFFICIENT SOLUTIONS TO THEM
I DON'T THINK THE HUMAN BRAIN IS IN A CONDITION TO BENEFIT MUCH FROM PHILOSOPHY AT THAT AGE THERE ARE MORE CONCRETE TOOLS THAT NEED TO BE LEARNED FIRST READING CALCULATING SKEPTICISM THESE MECHANICS OF DAILY LIFE LET US FUNCTION AND HELP KEEP US SAFE
I WAS IN AN OPTIONAL PHILOSOPHY CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL HAD ABOUT TEN STUDENTS SAT IN A CIRCLE AND DEBATED ISSUES AFTER READING A VARIETY OF TEXTS EVERYONE WAS ENGAGED EVERYONE WANTED TO BE THERE ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I'VE TAKEN
I DONT AGREE PHILOSOPHY IS NOT NECESSARY TO LIVE A HAPPY LIFE IN FACT IT CASTS DOUBTS ON MANY THING YOU KNEW FOR SURE AND YOU EVENTUALLY LEARN TO COPE WITH THE FACT THAT YOU LIVE IN A WORLD OF UNCERTAINTIES PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE AND HAPPIER NOT EXAMINING EVERYTHING LITTLE THING PHILOSOPHY IS FOR THE TYPE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO CURIOUS FOR THEIR OWN GOOD NOT FOR EVERYONE
NO THEY DID THAT IN BRAZIL NOW THEY ARE REVOKING THANKS GOD

HONESTLY THE VIDEO SEEMS OVERLY SELF-IMPORTANT AND THE PRESENTATION SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE WITH SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER TRYING NOT TO BE MADE FUN OF IN R IAMVERYSMART AND FAILING MISERABLY I THINK THE CREATOR FUNDAMENTALLY MISUNDERSTANDS THE VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY EDUCATION IT'S NOT TO MAKE PEOPLE PHILOSOPHERS IT'S BECAUSE CRITICAL THINKING MAKES PEOPLE ADAPTABLE

CONSERVATIVES ARE PUSHING EDUCATION IN TRADES RATHER THAN FULL COLLEGE DEGREES AS A WAY TO REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON COLLEGE DEGREES WHICH HAVE BEEN VASTLY OVERSOLD OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES BUT HERE'S THE THING EDUCATION IN TRADES IS FINE AND A GOOD WAY TO START MAKING MONEY AS SOON AS YOU'RE PLACED INTO A JOB BUT MANY TECHNICAL FIELDS CHANGE RAPIDLY MAKING ONE'S EDUCATION IN THAT FIELD OBSOLETE IN RELATIVELY SHORT ORDER IF NOT STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GATE WHICH IS WHY THE ABILITY TO LEARN ON YOUR FEET IS SO IMPORTANT

WHAT GOOD IS A TRADE EDUCATION RELATING TO THE BRACKING INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE IF BRACKING BECOMES REGULATED OUT OF EXISTENCE AND WHAT GOOD IS IT IF DEMAND COLLAPSES FOR PETROCHEMICALS SOURCE FROM BRACKING AS HAS HAPPENED IN THE US OIL INDUSTRY AS A RESULT OF OPEC MAINTAINING HIGH LEVELS OF PRODUCTION IF YOU'VE TAKEN OUT LOANS FOR EDUCATION IN A TRADE AND THEN THE TRADE COLLAPSES THEN WE'RE ALL STUCK HOLDING THE BILL

FORMAL COLLEGE EDUCATION DOES TEACH TRADES BUT THE SAD REALITY IS THAT MUCH OF WHAT YOU LEARN IS GOING TO BE OBSOLETE BY THE TIME YOU EARN YOUR DEGREE ESPECIALLY IN TECHNICAL FIELDS THE BIGGEST VALUE PROVIDED BY FORMAL COLLEGE EDUCATION IS THAT IT TEACHES SKILLS IN ADAPTABILITY WHEN THINGS INEVITABLY DO CHANGE ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES IS PHILOSOPHY ITSELF PHILOSOPHY IS SURPRISINGLY ONE OF THE TOP EARNING UNDERGRAD STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GATE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TEACH A TRADE BUT YEARS DOWN THE LINE PHILOSOPHY THE HUMANITIES DEGREE CAN BE NEAR THE TOP OF ALL WAGE EARNERS

A SORT OF LITE PHILOSOPHY EDUCATION IS INCLUDED IN THE CORE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY PROPERLY ACCREDITED COLLEGE DEGREE PROGRAM LITERATURE COMPOSITION RHETORIC NATURAL SCIENCES MATHS AND PSYCHOLOGY ARE ALL INTENDED IN THE CORE REQUIREMENTS TO TEACH CRITICAL THINKING AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL IN TEACHING HOW TO LEARN A PHILOSOPHY DEGREE PROGRAM IS ALL OF THIS AND MORE TURNED UP TO ALL CRITICAL THINKING AND CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING ALL THE TIME CS MAJORS TAKE THE SAME CLASSES IN FORMAL LOGIC THAT PHILOSOPHY MAJORS DO WHICH IS JUST ONE OF MANY WAYS THAT PHILOSOPHY MAJORS CAN HAVE A LEG UP YEARS DOWN THE LINE THE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A CRACK AT PROGRAMMING AND BE ABLE TO DIVE IN EASIER BECAUSE THEY ALREADY UNDERSTAND FORMAL LOGIC IT'S ONE THING TO BE WELL-READ BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO BE ABLE TO TAKE WHAT YOU READ AND PUT IT INTO PRACTICE IN SHAPING YOUR OWN LIFE YEARS DOWN THE LINE A COLLEGE GRAD WILL BE DOING BETTER THAN SOMEONE WHO LEARNED A TRADE THAT THEY CAN'T WORK IN ANYMORE BECAUSE THEIR SPECIALTY WAS REGULATED INTO OBLIVION AND A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR WILL BE DOING BETTER THAN MOST COLLEGE GRADS BECAUSE THE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR UNDERSTANDS HOW TO LEARN
I TOOK AN IB PHILOSOPHY CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL WHICH I WASN'T ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING BECAUSE I WASN'T IN THE PROGRAM AND SUBSEQUENTLY GOT THROWN OUT OF SAID CLASSICAL WHILE I WAS THERE THOUGH WE DID A PROJECT WHERE WE STUDIED ASSIGNED PHILOSOPHERS FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND THEN HELD DEBATES PLAYING THE PARTS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS WE STUDIED WE TURNED IN A PAPER DESCRIBING THE BELIEFS OF OUR PHILOSOPHERS AND THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR THOSE BELIEFS AS WELL I BELIEVE THIS MODEL COULD EASILY BE REPLICATED IN AVERAGE CLASSROOMS IN AMERICA'S HIGH SCHOOLS AT LEAST OVER A SEMESTER IF NOT A FULL YEAR AS A CORE SUBJECT THE FIRST HALF THE TEACHER WALKS THE STUDENTS THROUGH THE HISTORY AND TIMELINES THE SECOND HALF GOING FURTHER INTO THE BELIEF SYSTEMS OF THE PHILOSOPHERS AND HOLDING SMALL DEBATES IN THE LAST MINUTES OF CLASS WITH STUDENTS ROTATING BETWEEN PARTICIPATING AND OBSERVING EACH TIME
COMPLETELY AGREE I'VE BEEN TEACHING MIDDLE SCHOOL AGED KIDS FOR THE LAST DECADES THE NEED BEGINS THERE IN ADOLESCENCE EVEN REALLY
I DISAGREE TO AN EXTENT RATHER THAN PHILOSOPHY I THINK CRITICAL THINKING SHOULD BE TAUGHT THIS SEEMS TO BE CLOSER TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM THE VIDEO IS CONCERNED ABOUT SIMPLY PUT NOT EVERYONE'S INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY AND NOT EVERY PHILOSOPHY CLASS WILL ENGAGE THE CLASS INTO THE QUESTIONING AND CONTEMPLATING OF THE IDEAS

NOT EVERYONE'S INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY AND THAT'S FINE THESE PEOPLE DEVELOP PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS OR CHOOSE TO BE IGNORANT ON A TOPIC WHAT'S NOT FINE IS THE CLOSE MINDEDNESS THAT LEADS TO FEELINGS OF BEING UNDER ATTACK WHEN QUESTIONED ON THE TOPIC WHAT I THINK WE NEED IN THIS CASE IS A CRITICAL THINKING CURRICULUM FOR EXAMPLE CRITICAL THINKING PICK ONE BIOLOGY PHYSICS CHEMISTRY RELIGION PHILOSOPHY ETC THE FIRST MODULE OF ALL OF THE COURSES WOULD BE RATHER STANDARDIZED AND WOULD EXPLORE MULTIPLE METHODS OF INQUIRY SUCH AS THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD AND AN ARRAY OF USEFUL GENERAL QUESTIONS THE CLASSES WOULD THEN SIMPLY DIVE INTO TOPICS RELEVANT TO WHATEVER GRADE LEVEL AND SUBJECT ASSIGN A VIEWPOINT THEN HAVE THE STUDENTS EXPLORE IT WHAT IDEAS SUPPORT IT WHAT IDEAS CHALLENGE IT HOW DOES IT RELATE TO THE WORLD HOW DOES IT IMPACT YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL WHAT MIGHT AN OPPONENT SAY IF IT WERE DEBATED THEN WE CAN CULMINATE A MORE TANGIBLE SENSE OF BEING IN THE OTHER PERSON'S SHOES WHICH IS SO LACKING THROUGHOUT SOCIETY
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WHILE HEARING THE OPENING TO THIS IS THAT IT WOULD MAKE FOR A REALLY AWESOME SAMPLE FOR A RAP SONG
I THINK THAT PHILOSOPHY WOULD BE VALUABLE BUT I'M GOING TO REVEAL MY BIAS AS A POLITICAL SCIENTIST AND SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CLASS THAT SPECIFICALLY COVERS POLITICAL THEORY AND IDEOLOGY IT HELPS PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW RATIONAL PEOPLE CAN ARRIVE AT VERY DIFFERENT WORLD VIEWS AND THEREFORE LEAD TO A GREATER RESPECT OF OPPOSING BELIEFS I WAS A SORT OF ARROGANT LIBERAL BEFORE I BEGAN STUDYING POLITICAL THEORY AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN UNDERSTAND MY POLITICAL VIEWS BETTER NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND OTHER ARGUMENTS CLEARLY THERE IS SOME OVERLAP HERE SINCE PHILOSOPHY CAN HELP TEACH KIDS TO RESPECT ALTERNATIVE GIVEN THAT WE ARE SO DIVIDED AS A NATION POLITICALLY I BELIEVE THAT THIS NARROW FOCUS WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL
PROBABLY NOT
NO IT WONT IT MIGHT CONNECT WITH A FEW BUT IF YOU WANT A BETTER SOCIETY BRING BACK SHOP CLASS THE MECHANICS CLASS AND FUND THE ARTS
HISTORY IS MOST IMPORTANT TODAYS MILLENNIAL ARE RUNNING HEAD FIRST INTO THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST

HISTORY TENDS TO REPEAT ITSELF DUE TO IGNORANCE OF THE PAST AND THE ABILITY TO LEARN FROM SOMEONE ELSES MISTAKES
HAVING TAKEN PHILOSOPHY CLASSES IN COLLEGE IVE CONCLUDED THAT FOR ME PHILOSOPHY IS A BIG FUCKING USELESS STUPID ASS WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY
WHAT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT IS CRITICAL THINKING BUT IT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT INCREMENTALLY START WITH SMALL THINGS AND MOVE ON TO BIGGER THINGS
WE ARE TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY AND IT DID NOTHING TO HELP OUR SOCIETY
YEARS AFTER TAKING GOOD AND BAD USEFUL AND PHILOSOPHY CLASSES WHAT I'VE FINALLY REALIZED IS THIS PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL IS HOW TO THINK IT'S HOW TO TAKE PIECES OF EVIDENCE OR INFORMATION AND COME TO A CONCLUSION JUST LIKE THERE'S DIFFERENT STYLES OF CARS BUILDINGS CLOTHING THEY ALL DO A JOB WITH MOST OF THE GOOD ONES NONE ARE RIGHT OR WRONG SO WHEN YOU STUDY PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL OR A PHILOSOPHER IN PARTICULAR YOU SHOULD BE STUDYING THE DIFFERENT KNOWN WAYS TO THINK THROUGH PROBLEMS WHEN YOU STUDY A BUNCH OF THEM THEN YOU HAVE A QUIVER FULL OF DIFFERENT TOOLS TO THINK OF THE BEST APPROACH TO THE PROBLEMS YOU'RE FACING SOME PROBLEMS NEED ZEN OTHERS NEED FREUD OTHERS NEED CHRISTIANITY AND OTHERS NEED STOICISM OR PLATO JUST LIKE A GOOD SOCCER PLAYER WILL HAVE MANY MOVES TO GET TO THE GOAL HAVING MANY WAYS OF THINKING WILL GET YOU TO YOUR OWN GOALS NONE ARE MORE RIGHT THAN THE OTHER BUT THEY ALL HAVE THEIR BEST TIME AND PLACE TO BE APPLIED STUDY LOTS OF THEM AND YOU'LL BE MUCH HAPPIER DEALING WITH PROBLEMS BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO DEAL WITH THEM AS BEST AS WE'VE FIGURED OUT SO FAR
NO SOCIAL POLITICS JUSTICE AND HOME ECONOMICS

I THINK THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE BASE I'M AN ADULT AND I FIND IT BLOODY HARD TO ADULT IN LIFE
OUR DUCATON SYSTEM HAS BECOME SO STREAMLINED TO CREATE SPECIALISTS THAT WE FORGET THAT THERE'S BASIC THINGS THAT AREN'T TAUGHT LIKE HOW TO COOK AND HOW TO FUCKING BUDGET FOR FOOD SO YOU CAN COOK

POLITICALLY I THINK WESTERN NATIONS AUSTRALIA INCLUDED HAVE REALIZED THAT AN UNINFORMED DISENGAGED POPULACE IS EASIER TO CONTROL

LOOK AT THE DEBACLE THAT IS THE US POLITICAL SYSTEM SERIOUSLY HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY KNOW OF ELECTORAL COLLEGES AND DELEGATES I HAVE DEGREES AND I CAN'T EVEN FOLLOW IT

PEOPLE SCREAM AND SHOUT WE'RE IN A DEMOCRACY IF YOU DONT LIKE IT CHANGE IT HOWEVER THEY FORGET THE OTHER OF THE NOTION HOW THE HELL DO I CHANGE THINGS

THE CHANGES TO THE US REGISTRATION PRETTY MUCH MAKES THE US AS DEMOCRATIC AS MAINLAND CHINA
OH YES YOU CAN REGISTER TO VOTE JUST TAKE A WEEK OFF YOUR WORK TO GET THROUGH THE PAPERWORK

FOR THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY ONE SHOULD ACTUALLY ENFORCE MANDATORY VOTING WHY BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DONT WANT THAT ARE THE INCUMBENT POLITICIANS
AT LEAST IT WOULD TEACH PEOPLE TO THINK ON THEIR OWN INSTEAD OF LETTING THE MSM THINK FOR THEM
THEY DON'T WANT THE KIDS TO LEARN TO THINK OUTSIDE OF WHAT THEY ARE PUSHING DOWN THEIR THROATS IN SCHOOLS NOW
NOPE TEACHING MEDITATION FROM EARLY YEARS WOULD
A PHENOMENAL ACADEMIC PROGRAM CALLED PROVIDES CURRICULA FOR HIGH SCHOOLS LOWER SCHOOLS GLOBALLY THAT ENGAGES STUDENTS IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TOPICS ON SOCIETY IDENTITY AND CIVILITY THE LITTLE ROCK NINE CIVIL RIGHTS IS INCLUDED IN ITS EXPERTLY DEVELOPED CONTENT AS WELL AS CURRENT EVENTS IT DOESN'T TEACH STUDENTS WHAT TO THINK IT TEACHES THEM HOW TO THINK A CHIEF MERIT OF PHILOSOPHY STUDY FACING HISTORY WAS FOR MY TWO SONS BY MAKING IMPORTANT QUESTIONS PERSONAL NOT ABSTRACT I CAN'T PRAISE IT ENOUGH
CHECK-OUT FACING HISTORY OURSELVES IT'S FORMAL NAME
FACING HISTORY
TEACHING EVERYWHERE WOULD BE GREAT
TEACHING CHEESEMAKING IN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CHEESEMAKER
JUST AMERICAN
CHILDREN AND TEENS ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO BOTH LEARN EVERYTHING WE WANT THEM TO AND TO FIND MOTIVATION OFTEN TIMES BY LOOKING FOR HOW IT WILL APPLY PHILOSOPHY IS FAR WORSE THAN MOST COURSES ON BOTH LEVELS A LEGITIMATE PHILOSOPHY CLASS WOULD BE LESS ACCESSIBLE THAN MOST HIGH SCHOOL COURSES SINCE IT REALLY DOESN'T CONNECT TO ANY OTHER AREAS THEY'VE LEARNED AND HAS VIRTUALLY ZERO APPLICATION FROM A PERSPECTIVE THIS ISN'T A GOOD WAY OF SPREADING PHILOSOPHY IT'S A GOOD WAY OF ENGENDERING HATRED FOR ANOTHER SUBJECT

IF YOU WANT TO PUSH THE MORE RIGOROUS AREAS OF PHILOSOPHY OFFER MORE CLASSES ON COMPUTER SCIENCE THAT INVOLVE LOGIC GATES AND SOME WORK ON HOW COMPUTER LANGUAGES ARE STRUCTURED YOU COULD ALSO INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS OF ETHICS EVEN LAYING THE TRACK FOR THEORIES OF ETHICS IN COURSES LIKE AMERICAN HISTORY THE ONLY PHILOSOPHY COURSE I CAN SEE HAVING MAJOR VALUE WOULD BE ONE ON BASIC REASONING BUT THIS ALREADY EXISTS IN A FASHION WITH DEBATE
I'D SAY HAVING CLASSES WHERE YOU PICK TWO STUDENTS AT RANDOM AND MAKE THEY HAVE TO DO A REPORT OF THE OTHER PERSONS FAMILY SO THEY HAVE TO SIT WITH EACH OTHER AND LEARN ABOUT THE OTHER STUDENT

I'VE LEARNED MORE IN MY LIFE FROM TALKING WITH PEOPLE THAT I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THAN WITH PEOPLE I KNOW
TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING WAS PART OF THE PSYCH CURRICULUM WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN
MOST HIGH SCHOOL CLASSES ARE A JOKE ESPECIALLY ELECTIVES
CAN WE IDENTIFY ANY OF THESE HUMANS IN THE BACKGROUND I AM EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN THEIR VIEWS THESE DAYS
TEACHING ECONOMICS IN HIGH SCHOOLS WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY WE HAVE ENOUGH PHILOSOPHERS TRYING TO PUSH THEIR IDEAS ON SOCIETY
CRITICAL THINKING IS EXTINCT
THERE WOULD BE ALOT MORE PEOPLE DOING PSYCHEDELICS AND WEED
IN MY FIRST YEAR OF UNIVERSITY I REALIZED MOST OF THE COURSES PHILOSOPHY INCLUDED I COULD OR SHOULD HAVE HAD IN HIGH SCHOOL WOULD IT MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY MAYBE WHAT'S WORSE IS THE DUMBING DOWN OF PUBLIC EDUCATION
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY WILL SEEK IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES HONESTLY AFTER YOU TEACH SOMEONE TO READ THE REST IS ON THEM FORCING SOMEONE TO LEARN SOMETHING THEY HATE IS JUST GOING TO MAKE THEM RESENT YOU PRACTICALLY THOUGH I'M NO SURE THAT IT MATTERS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES IN SCHOOL SO THEY CAN GROW UP TO BE MISERABLE ADULTS MAKING AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN
BETTER THOUGHT TEACH INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION
THINK PERSONAL FINANCE IN HIGH SCHOOL WILL BE WAY MORE BENEFICIAL
FREE THINKING ISN'T ALLOWED
THEY NEED TO TEACH PSYCHOLOGY SO THAT THOSE TEENAGERS WHO SUFFER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS AND DEPRESSION CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S EVER BEEN ANYTHING MORE WORTHLESS THAN PHILOSOPHY
WELL IF YOU CAN'T BEAT EM JOIN EM I THINK
CAREFUL REDDIN ONLY SUPPORTS STEM TOPICS
IT WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING PEOPLE WOULD JUST SIT THERE AND NOT PARTICIPATE
CONSIDERING THAT THE PUBLISHERS OF THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS CONSIDERED PHILOSOPHER TO BE SUCH A FOREIGN CONCEPT TO US READERS THAT THE TITLE HAD TO BE CHANGED TO SORCERER FOR THE FIRST BOOK TO BE PUBLISHABLE IN THE US I'D SAY NO WAY JOSE I MEAN IT WOULD BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN
NO IT WOULDN'T AMERICANS WOULD LEARN SOME FORM OF PHILOSOPHY THAT IS PERVERTED BY THE FASCISM THAT PERVERTS THEIR HEALTH EDUCATION
I CALL BULLCRAP ON TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IN HS

THAT PIC REMINDS ME OF WHEN THE DEMOCRATS WERE TERRORIZING BLACK PEOPLE IN THE US
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NEED TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY SO MUCH AS CRITICAL THINKING AND ARGUMENTATION SKILLS IN HIGH SCHOOL I WOULD HAVE NOT GIVEN A SHIT ABOUT KANT BUT I WOULD HAVE LOVED BEING ABLE TO WRITE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF ALCOHOL USING LOGICAL PREMISE PREMISE CONCLUSION FORMATS I THINK IF WE WERE TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY TO GRADE SCHOOLERS THE EMPHASIS NEEDS TO BE ON HOW TO THINK ARGUE UNDERSTAND THE OTHER SIDE AND STILL MAKE A SOPHISTICATED POINT THEN STUDENTS COULD WRITE ABOUT WHATEVER SUBJECTS EXCITE THEM THE POINT WOULD BE TO GET THEM THINKING ABOUT SUBJECTS IN A PHILOSOPHICAL WAY
TEACHING THE TRIVIUM METHOD WOULD MAKE FOR AN EVEN BETTER SOCIETY THAN THAT AS THE LEARNING TOOLS GAINED GREATLY ENLIGHTEN PHILOSOPHY AND MAKE THE SUBJECT FAR EASIER TO MASTER
BETTER SOCIETY DOES NOT START UNTIL THE WEALTH OF THE HEAD BECOMES A WEALTH OF THE HEART
I LOVE PHILOSOPHY AND WHILE I DO WISH MORE PEOPLE WOULD STUDY IT AND I'D PROBABLY EVEN AGREE THAT IF MORE PEOPLE STUDIED PHILOSOPHY SOCIETY WOULD IMPROVE THAT SAID I AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS HERE IN THAT TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING AND PERSONAL FINANCE ARE TWO AREAS THAT WOULD HAVE A MUCH MUCH LARGER IMPACT ON BOTH THE PERSONAL LIVES OF EACH STUDENT AS WELL AS PRESENT A LARGER BENEFIT TO SOCIETY AS A WHOLE
I THINK THE IB APPROACH IS A GOOD ONE STIMULATE CRITICAL THINKING AND RATIONAL ANALYSIS
I THINK MOST PEOPLE JUST DON'T CARE
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY FUCKING POSTS ABOUT THIS SUBJECT WE GET IT SHARE THE IDEA WITH PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY CONVINCED
FUCK THAT TEACHING ENGLISH AND TESTING FOR RETENTION WOULD BE THE CAT'S ASS FOLLOW THAT WITH SPELLING WRITING AND THINKING
NAH THEN PEOPLE WOULD BEGIN TO QUESTION THE STATUS QUO

YOUR MASTERS DO NOT WANT THIS

STAY IN THE CAVE
I WAS MAJORING IN PHILOSOPHY A FEW YEARS AGO TO BE ABLE TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL MOST PROFESSORS I TALKED TO ABOUT IT TOLD ME IT WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT THAT THEY'D NEVER HEARD OF IT HAPPENING ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY NOW I'M MAJORING IN LINGUISTICS
RATHER THAN PHILOSOPHY BUILD THE GROUNDWORK FOR DEBATE LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING FIRST PHILOSOPHY IS HEAVY READING UNFORTUNATELY MAYBE TOO ADVANCED FOR MOST SCHOOL AGED KIDS TO REALLY GRASP THAT IS UNLESS WE CAN BREAK THE PHILOSOPHICAL ELEMENTS INTO MANAGEABLE MODULES FOR EDUCATION SYSTEM
I MEAN MAYBE BUT IT'S MORE LIKELY TO CREATE EVEN MORE INSUFFERABLE TEENAGERS WHO THINK THEY KNOW HOW THE WORLD SHOULD WORK

IT'S LIKE I KNEW AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN KIDS WHO THOUGHT COMMUNISM WAS THE BEST THING EVER IN HIGHSCHOOL AND WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ANY OF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT I IMAGINE THINKING OF SOMEONE ARGUING KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY IN THE SAME MANNER AND CRINGE
I AGREE IMMENSELY THAT PHILOSOPHY COULD HELP ALL OF US BUT THE ISSUE IS TRYING TO GET A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT TO CARE AND ACTUALLY PUT FORTH THE EFFORT TO LEARN FROM IT I WAS A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR IN COLLEGE SO I FIND IT FASCINATING BUT EVEN THEN I CAN SEE WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE BORED BY IT

HONESTLY I THINK THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS SIMPLY THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE DESIRE TO THINK WITH ANY NUANCE IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO JUST FORM A BLACK AND WHITE OPINION AND TO HATE THOSE THAT DISAGREE

I ACTUALLY THINK THIS BRINGS UP A VERY INTERESTING AND PERHAPS CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION IS A SOCIETY OF MAJORITY INTELLECTUALS EVEN POSSIBLE OR IS THE NATURAL ORDER OF THE WORLD TO HAVE A SMALL INTELLECTUAL CLASS OF COURSE IN ORDER TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YOU'D HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT YOU EVEN MEAN BY INTELLECTUAL IS THERE AN OBJECTIVE QUALIFICATION FOR THAT TERM OR DOES IT SIMPLY DESCRIBE THE TOP OF PEOPLE
SAYS THE PHILOSOPHERS
NAZIS SAY THE SAME THING DOESNT MAKE THEM RIGHT
SO WOULD TEACHING PORN PRODUCTION

HINT DEFINE PHILOSOPHY BETTER AND SOCIETY

I DON'T THINK THIS SUB IS EXACTLY NEUTRALLY BIASED
I'M A FRESHMAN IN MY FIRST QUARTER IN COLLEGE AND TAKING MY FIRST EVER PHILOSOPHY CLASS ETHICS AND MORALITY IN SOCIETY AND IT'S FASCINATING I'M A MATH MAJOR AND TOOK IT BECAUSE ONE OF MY MAJOR CLASSES WASN'T AVAILABLE BUT IT'S A PLEASANT SURPRISE IF WE TAUGHT IT IN HIGH SCHOOL THOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF ALL KIDS WOULD BE MATURE ENOUGH THE CLASS I'M IN DISCUSSES TOPICS SUCH AS RAPE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ABORTION EUTHANASIA ETC AND IN HIGH SCHOOL NOT ALL KIDS ARE REALLY READY TO HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE TOPICS THEN AGAIN I DON'T REALLY HAVE ALL THAT MUCH EXPERIENCE AS THIS IS MY FIRST CLASS SO MAYBE THERE ARE MORE APPROPRIATE PHILOSOPHY COURSES FOR HIGH SCHOOLERS
NOT ONLY PHILOSOPHY BUT A REASONING ARGUMENTATION CLASSICAL I TOOK ONE FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE AND I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT STRUCTURING YOUR ARGUMENTS AND IDENTIFYING FALLACIES I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT KNOWLEDGE EARLY ON
THEY SHOULD TEACH CRITICAL THINKING AND HOW TO BALANCE A CHECKING ACCOUNT AND FILING TAXES
THAT A GOOD IDEA BUT YOU NEED GOOD CAREZMATIC TEACHERS
I THINK TEACHING ECONOMICS AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS WILL HAVE A MORE LASTING BENEFIT
SEE THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE HERE IS THE FACTORY NEVER BOTHERED TO INSTALL A THRESHOLD FOR BELIEF HE WILL PROBABLY GROW UP BELIEVING WHATEVER MAKES HIM FEEL BETTER ABOUT HIMSELF LIKELY A FUTURE AYN RAND ENTHUSIAST AND REPUBLICAN ID SEE IF YOU CAN RETURN IT
WHICH IS WHY IT WON'T HAPPEN PEOPLE ARE EASIER TO CONTROL WHEN THE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO ARGUE
PHILOSOPHY IS SADLY WELL BEYOND THE MENTAL ABILITIES OF MOST PEOPLE IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
REMOVED
NUMBER AMERICA NEEDS MANDATORY ECONOMICS CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL
NO IT WOULDN'T BECAUSE IT WOULD AMOUNT TO EDGY DROPOUTS TALKING NONSTOP ABOUT NIETZSCHE IF YOU TAUGHT ACTUAL PHILOSOPHERS LIKE THE PLATO THE ROMANS ARISTOTLE STREET BOETHIUS STREET AQUINAS AND ALL THE MODERNS FROM DESCARTES TO JUST SHORT OF KANT BECAUSE KANT IS ADMITTEDLY DIFFICULT TO PARSE YOU KNOW ACTUAL PHILOSOPHY KIDS WOULDN'T TAKE THE CLASSICAL EVEN PHILOSOPHY MAJORS DURING MY UNDERGRAD TOOK THE CLASSES THINKING THEY WERE EASY AND DROPPED THEM WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAD TO READ A BOOK PER WEEK AND WRITE AT LEAST PAGES PER SEMESTER
NO IT WOULDN'T IT WOULD MEAN THAT TEENS WOULD LEARN THE DEFINITION OF DEONTOLOGY AND THEN FORGET ABOUT IT IN A MONTH
THAT ARTICLE IS COMPLETE BULLSHIT

FULL OF STATEMENTS LIKE OUR COUNTRY IS SLOWLY BUT SURELY COMMITTING SUICIDE

THE US IS THE MOST POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS NATION EVER THE SUICIDE MUST BE PRETTY FUCKING SLOW
DEPENDS ON THE PHILOSOPHY ITSELF I'VE HAD PHILOSOPHY CLASSES WHERE IT WAS JUST ENDLESS DRIVELS OF ADORNO FOUCAULT HORKHEIMER MARCUSE AND WHATNOT THEN I ALSO HAD FAR MORE INTERESTING TOPICS IN MY OPINION AT LEAST SUCH AS ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHY NIETZSCHE CONFUCIUS CICERO ETC

IT'S FAR MORE SUBJECTIVE THAN ANY OTHER TOPIC AND IT DEPENDS ON WHATEVER PHILOSOPHER YOU'RE GOING TO TEACH IF YOU TEACH EVERYONE MARX ENGELS AND LENIN THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET A MUCH DIFFERENT SOCIETY THAN IF YOU TEACH ARISTOTLE AQUINAS AND CONFUCIUS
UNTIL WE REACH A POINT WHERE OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES CAN READ AT LEAST A MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL I'D SAY LETS NOT WASTE TIME ON FRIVOLOUS CLASSES LIKE PHILOSOPHY
TRY TEACHING ANYTHING IN SCHOOL NOWADAYS YOU GET BOMBARDED BY THE PC POLICE

PHILOSOPHY IS THE ENEMY OF PC
ABSOLUTELY IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY HURT AND WOULD BE MORE VALUABLE THAN SOCIAL STUDIES BLACK HISTORY MONTH INSERT FASHIONABLE PC BS ETC
JUST SAYING BUT ALSO NAZIS HAD A PHILOSOPHIC BASE FOR THEIR DICTATURE MOSTLY HEGEL IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY BUT DEFINEDLY NOT SURE THE MOST EDUCATIVE CURRENTS WOULD PROBABLY BE THE ANCIENT GREEKS ONES AND THE POLITICAL ONES THAT DESCRIBE THE BASIS FOR DEMOCRACY AND MONARCHY ETC MILLER MONTESQUIEU AND THE KINDS
SORRY FOR THE ENGLISH
REMOVED
YA KNOW WHAT MAKES A BETTER SOCIETY NOT CODDLING CHILDREN NOT TEACHING THEM EVERYONE IS EQUAL NOT REWARDING MEDIOCRITY INSTEAD TEACH THEM REAL LIFE SKILLS COMMUNICATION ACTUAL MATH AND SCIENCE

INSTEAD WHAT WE HAVE TODAY IS NOTHING BUT A PROPAGANDA MACHINE
SO WAIT DO PEOPLE IN LIKE THE SOUTH OR SOMETHING NOT HAVE PHILOSOPHY IN HIGHSCHOOL WE SURE DID IN WISCONSIN
THE REDISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND EQUALITY FOR ALL WOULD CREATE THE PERFECT SOCIETY
I HAD PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH-SCHOOL

IT'S BASICALLY HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY

MOST PEOPLE WHO CAN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND LOGICAL PHARMACIES CAN GET AN A
WE WANT SCHOOLS TO TEACH CHILDREN HOW TO THINK I'M NOT SURE I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND IF ITS JUST TEACHING THEM THE TRIVIA OF PHILOSOPHY I'M NOT SURE THAT'S GOING TO BE ANYMORE HELPFUL THAN THE TRIVIA I LEARNED ABOUT IN HISTORY
THE SOUTH IS TOO BUSY FIGHTING ON WHETHER OR NOT WE GET TO TEACH THE BIBLE AS A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF ACTUAL EVENTS WE DON'T NEED PHILOSOPHY INTERFERING WITH THAT WITH MORE CRITICALLY THINKING SATANIST S
GETTING THE FEDERAL GOVT OUT OF THE CLASSROOM WOULD MAKE FOR A BETTER SOCIETY
WE SHOULD REQUIRE ALL PHILOSOPHERS TO LEARN SOME PSYCHOLOGY THEN THEY'D REALIZE THAT TRYING TO GET ALL PEOPLE TO AGREE IS HOPELESS
IT SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT THAT WITH PHILOSOPHY EVERYONE SMOKES WEED
YEAH FEED THEM SOME MORE BORING SHIT
NO IT WON'T IT WILL JUST MAKE PEOPLE MORE ARROGANT IN THEIR ABILITY AND SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS WE ALL KNOW PHILOSOPHY STUDENTS
REMOVED
LOOK AT ALL THESE NAGGERS
NAH THEY'D ALL BECOME NIHILISTS AND KILL EACH OTHER
AND THEN THEY WOULD BE PREPARED FOR ALL THE BIG PHILOSOPHY COMPANIES THAT ARE GROWING WE ALREADY TEACH TOO MUCH USELESS STUFF IN SCHOOL THAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE PEOPLE THAT ALREADY STUDY IT RICH SELF ABSORBED KIDS WHO WANT TO FIGURE OUT THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE SO THEY CAN ANSWER THAT AGE OLD QUESTION WHY DID DADDY NOT HUG ME ENOUGH
PHILOSOPHY AND ETHICS CLASSES ARE A JOKE THROW A SWITCH AND KILL PEOPLE OR LET THE TRAIN ON THE TRACK KILL ONE WHAT A BUNCH OF HYPOTHETICAL FUCKING BULLSHIT

AMERICAN STUDENTS NEED TO LEARN HOW THE POLITICAL SYSTEM BANKS AND TAXES WORK IT IS MUCH EASIER TO SEE EVIL WHEN ONE UNDERSTANDS IT
AMERICANS WOULD BE MORE EDUCATED IF THERE WERE NO SCHOOLS
THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE SCHOOL ROOM IN ONE GENERATION WILL BE THE PHILOSOPHY OF GOVERNMENT IN THE NEXT ABRAHAM LINCOLN
YOU DON'T NEED TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY YOU NEED TO TEACH MORALS AND ETHICS WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG WHICH ISN'T PHILOSOPHY BUT RELIGION BUT WAIT THAT'S TOO SCARY FOR AMERICAN EDUCATION BOARDS TO TEACH YOU MIGHT OFFEND SOMEONE SO LET'S ALL SIT HERE IN A CESSPOOL OF UNFRIVOLOUS AND UNDIGNIFIED STUPIDITY AND DENIAL FOR THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS UNTIL WE LOSE OUR FREEDOM DUE TO A LACK OF CREATIVITY
MY INTRODUCTION WAS THE ENCHIRIDION BY EPICTETUS ITS AVAILABLE FOR FREE HERE

SO IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN A GOOD SHORT INTRO I THINK ITS VERY GOOD I MIGHT BE AN IDIOT THOUGH SO SEE FOR YOURSELVES
IS MARCUS AURELIUS MEDITATIONS REALLY ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS ON STOICISM

THE FIRST BOOK ON STOICISM I'VE PICKED UP IS MEDITATIONS AND I'M STRUGGLING TO FINISH IT HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T INTEND FOR THIS TO BE READ BY OTHER PEOPLE OFTEN THE SAME CONCEPTS AND IDEAS ARE TOLD AGAIN AND AGAIN IN JUST MARGINALLY DIFFERENT WAYS IT GETS REALLY TIRESOME AND DIFFICULT TO READ FOR ME THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE ABSOLUTELY NO STRUCTURE JUST DOT POINTS ON ANYTHING HE FELT LIKE WRITING ABOUT

I IMAGINE IF HE WAS JUST WRITING THIS FOR HIMSELF TO HELP HIM MAINTAIN AND STRENGTHEN HIS STOIC MINDSET THEN THAT'S PROBABLY WHY IT'S TOUGH TO READ FOR ME
MORALITY IS CONCERNED WITH THE WELL-BEING OF OTHERS AND SUFFERING IS A DECREASE IN THE WELL-BEING OF OTHERS THUS IT IS ARGUABLY MORE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SUBSTANCE OF MORALITY THAN LANGUAGE OR REASONING CAPACITY IT IS ALSO THE ONLY THING WE KNOW OF THAT IS BAD FOR EVERYONE WHO EXPERIENCES IT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL PAIN AS THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DERIVE ENJOYMENT FROM THAT IF YOU DEFINE SUFFERING AS THE EXPERIENCE OF A STATE OF AFFAIRS THE EXPERIENCER WOULD RATHER NOT BE THE CASE AND THE INTENSITY OF THE SUFFERING IS LINKED TO HOW MUCH ONE WOULD RATHER IT NOT BE THE CASE THEN THE SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT OF SUFFERING NO LONGER POSES A PROBLEM
HOW IS THE ABILITY TO SUFFER ANY LESS ARBITRARY THAN ABILITY TO SPEAK OR ABILITY TO REASON


THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT IT SEEMS OBVIOUS TO MOST PEOPLE WHO WORK ON RELATED PROBLEMS IT REDUCES TO RAW INTUITION IN A SIMILAR WAY TO COGITO ERGO SUM

MOST PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS HAVE A VERY STRONG INTUITION THAT SUFFERING PLEASURE HAVE VERY CLEAR MORAL RELEVANCE THAT DOESN'T CHANGE WHEN YOU SPEAK TO DEONTOLOGIST INSTEAD OF CONSEQUENTIALIST UTILITARIANS LIKE SINGER IF YOU ASK A KANTIAN LIKE CHRISTINE KORSGAARD ABOUT WHERE THE SOURCE OF VALUE IS IN THE UNIVERSE YOU'D BE STARTLED AT HOW UTILITARIAN THEY SOUND SHE REFERS TO HEDONIC STATES OF CONSCIOUS BEINGS


THE VAST MAJORITY OF PHILOSOPHERS WILL AGREE THAT SUFFERING PLEASURE ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO MORALITY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEONTOLOGIST AND UTILITARIANS IS THAT UTILITARIANS DON'T THINK THE LARGER FACTS OF THE CREATURE PERSON EXPERIENCING SUFFERING PLEASURE MATTER
SUFFERING IS VERY UNLIKE SPEECH OR CONSCIOUS THOUGHT SUFFERING REQUIRES NO KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE OR DEATH NO PROFUNDITY OF ANY KIND TO SUFFER ONLY REQUIRES ONE TO FEEL AND BE HARMED THROUGH THOSE FEELINGS IT TAKES IN THE LARGEST GROUP AND IT ALLOWS THE GREATER ANIMALS TO EMPATHIZE WITH THE LESSOR TO UNDERSTAND THAT PAIN MAY BE THE MOST UNIVERSAL BINDING BETWEEN US TO UNDERSTAND THAT PAIN SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN WITHOUT REASON AND THAT WITH MORE POWER AND ABILITY ONE HAS THE MORE WALLS SHOULD BE PUT UP TO PREVENT SUFFERING

CONSCIOUSNESS MAY BE TIED TO THE CAPACITY TO SUFFER THE HIGHER THE CONSCIOUSNESS IF A CREATURE THE MORE IT HAS THE ABILITY TO FEEL AND UNDERSTAND PAIN
THE CAPACITY FOR SUFFERING AND ENJOYING THINGS IS A
PREREQUISITE FOR HAVING INTERESTS AT ALL A CONDITION THAT MUST BE SATISFIED BEFORE WE CAN SPEAK
OF INTERESTS IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY IT WOULD BE NONSENSE TO SAY THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE INTERESTS
OF A STONE TO BE KICKED ALONG THE ROAD BY A SCHOOLBOY A STONE DOES NOT HAVE INTERESTS BECAUSE
IT CANNOT SUFFER NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO IT COULD POSSIBLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO ITS WELFARE
A MOUSE ON THE OTHER HAND DOES HAVE AN INTEREST IN NOT BEING TORMENTED BECAUSE IT WILL
SUFFER IF IT IS

THE ABILITY TO SUFFER IS THE MINIMUM REQUIRED FOR AN ENTITY TO EXPERIENCE A NEGATIVE INTERACTION THE AUTHOR'S GENERAL ARGUMENT IS THAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US AND OTHER THINGS THAT CAN SUFFER CANNOT BE USED AS A REASON TO GIVE THOSE THINGS LESS CONSIDERATION HE PRODUCES THIS ARGUMENT BY BEGINNING WITH THE FACT THAT WE GIVE ALL HUMANS EQUAL CONSIDERATION REGARDLESS OF THEIR UNEQUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND CONTINUING TO SHOW THAT THERE IS NO SINGLE CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENTIATING US FROM ANIMALS WHICH WE FIND APPROPRIATE TO DISCRIMINATE ON IN PEOPLE

SO THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS ONE OF

A ABILITIES AND ATTRIBUTES ARE APPROPRIATE QUALIFICATIONS FOR DISCRIMINATION

B NO ACT OF DISCRIMINATION IS MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE
WHAT MAKES SOMETHING BAD

PAIN PAIN CAN BE GOOD IF IT IS IN SERVICE OF SOMETHING HIGHER AVOIDING AN EVEN WORSE THREAT

PREFERENCE VIOLATIONS SOMETIMES NOT GETTING WHAT YOU WANT LEADS TO HIGHER UTILITY YOU CAN BE MISTAKEN OR

I DON'T THINK BAD CAN BE DEFINED OUTSIDE OF CONTEXT BAD IS ONLY BAD IF WHEN GIVEN THE ENTIRE CONTEXT THE PAIN THAT LEADS TO NO PARTICULAR END OR THE PREFERENCE VIOLATION TURNS OUT TO BE JUST THAT HOWEVER WE RARELY HAVE THE ENTIRE CONTEXT TO MOST SITUATIONS AS SUCH IT CAN BE HARD TO KNOW IF ANY PARTICULAR PAIN TRULY LEADS TO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL IT CAN BE HARD TO KNOW IF VIOLATING SOMEONES PREFERENCE IN THE MOMENT WILL OR WON'T HAVE THEM THANKING YOU LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD AS SUCH DEFINITIONS LIKE NEEDLESS PAIN OR MEANINGLESS SUFFERING OR CRUEL VIOLATION OF PREFERENCE DO CAPTURE WHAT IS MORALLY RELEVANT BUT ARE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY APPLY IN ANY CONTEXT SINCE WE SIMPLY CANNOT KNOW

IN THE END ITS NOT THE ABILITY TO SUFFER OR THE ABILITY TO FEEL PAIN THAT IS BAD ITS THE ABILITY TO SUFFER NEEDLESSLY OR MEANINGLESSLY THAT IS BAD IF SOMEHOW WE DIDN'T FEEL PAIN IN SITUATIONS WHERE PAIN IS UNAVOIDABLE IN OUR BENEFIT TO AN EXTENT THIS IS TRUE ADRENALINE DURING FLIGHT OR FIGHT REDUCES SENSITIVITY TO PAIN BUT THIS FAILS TO COVER MANY MOST CASES THEN THE ABILITY TO FEEL PAIN WOULD NOT BE MORALLY BAD
THAIS BOOK IS VERY READABLE AND ENJOYABLE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I AM NOW GOING BACK TO READ THE EARLIER THE DREAM OF REASON WHICH COVERS ANCIENT THROUGH RENAISSANCE PHILOSOPHY MUCH SLOWER GOING AND IN MY OPINION NOT AS INTERESTING
I'M KINDA NEW TO PHILOSOPHY AND KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT MODERN PHILOSOPHY IS THIS GUY WORTH READING
ABSTRACT

PROBLEMS FOR THE CAUSAL THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE LED EPISTEMOLOGIST TO PROPOSE THAT KNOWLEDGE IS A MATTER OF TRACKING THE TRUTH FRED DRETSKE AND ROBERT NOVICK DEVELOPED THIS IDEA USING COUNTERFACTUAL CONDITIONS IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO GEOFF LYNN NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY EXAMINES THE TRACKING IDEA CONSIDER HOW IT IMPROVES ON THE CAUSAL THEORY AND THEN DISCUSS SOME WELL KNOWN OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORIES ADVANCED BY DRETSKE AND NOVICK

AMA

THIS VIDEO IS BY GEOFF LYNN WHO IS DOING AN AMA HERE ON R PHILOSOPHY TOMORROW OCTOBER AT ET YOU CAN JOIN THE CONVERSATION BY ASKING QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME AT THE ANNOUNCEMENT POST OR BY POSTING IN THE LIVE THREAD TOMORROW AT
I THINK WISDOM CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED AS A COMBINATION OF INTELLECT KNOWLEDGE EXPERIENCE AND SELF AWARENESS A MAN MAY BE VERY INTELLIGENT BUT HE MAY ALSO BE A COMPLETE FOOL SLOW PEOPLE WITH DIFFICULTIES ARE MUCH MORE HARMLESS THAN IGNORANT FOOLISH PEOPLE WHO MAY BE INTELLIGENT I THINK WISDOM IS VERY RARE INDEED AND ONLY DEPENDS ON INTELLECT TO AN EXTENT

THAT VOICE WAS VERY ANNOYING BTW
NOT A BIG SURPRISE THERE SINCE THE SUBJECTS AT HANDS DID NOT CHANGE IN THE MEANTIME

MANKIND IS STILL THE SAME AT HEART
I WAS JUST HAVING A POLITICAL DISCUSSION AND WAS TOLD ALL GREEK POLITICAL SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY WAS IRRELEVANT AND ABSURD TO BRING UP IN MODERN POLITICS STILL STAUNCHING THE RESULTING ANEURYSMS
GOOD ARTICLE
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE POSSIBILITY OF INCOMPREHENSIBILITY

BUT SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING MAY BE PERMANENTLY DENIED TO US BY THE LIMITS OF OUR NATURE

REFLECTION ON WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A BAT SEEMS TO LEAD US THEREFORE TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE ARE FACTS THAT DO NOT CONSIST IN THE TRUTH OF PROPOSITIONS EXPRESSIBLE IN A HUMAN LANGUAGE

AND THE PROVING INCOMPREHENSIBILITY

WE WON T EVER KNOW BECAUSE OUR LANGUAGE COGNITIVE ABILITY DOESN T ALLOW IT I EAST THE ABOVE QUOTE BY NAGEL

SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE MAY SEEM LIKE A MYSTERY NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT BUT MORE IS REQUIRED TO TAKE IT TO THE FULL STATUS OF A MYSTERY WHOSE ANSWER LIES BEYOND HUMAN CAPABILITY THAN JUST ACKNOWLEDGING ITS SEEMINGLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE NATURE

IT SEEMS LIKE PREMISE AND YOUR CONCLUSION ARE SOMEWHAT IN CONTRADICTION IN PREMISE YOU CLAIM THAT THE COMPUTER WILL MOST LIKELY EXPERIENCE THE WORLD BUT YOUR CONCLUSION IS THAT WE CANNOT MAKE SUCH A CLAIM I ALSO THINK YOU MIGHT BE TAKING ARGUMENT A BIT TOO FAR CONCLUSION ISN'T THAT WE CANNOT CLAIM THAT A BAT HAS CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE IT'S THAT WE JUST CAN'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
CAN THE OP PROVE THAT HE HAS CONSCIOUSNESS IF WE ACCEPT HIS FIRST ARGUMENT POINT THEN WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF HE OR ANYONE ELSE HAS CONSCIOUSNESS NO MATTER WHAT HE OR THEY MAY PROFESS SO IF WE CAN'T DETERMINE IF OTHER PEOPLE BATS ALIENS ETC HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS IT IS CERTAINLY IRRELEVANT WHETHER OR NOT COMPUTERS HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS SINCE WE CAN'T KNOW IF ANYTHING HAS CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS UTTER SKEPTICISM WHICH IS NOT VERY USEFUL IN REAL LIFE
COMPUTERS BUILD THEIR INTELLIGENCE THROUGH A SYSTEM OF BALANCING COSTS AND BENEFITS TO SLOWLY CONDITION A PARTICULAR FUNCTION YOU CAN THINK ABOUT OUR BRAINS AND ALL INTELLIGENCE AS A MATHEMATICAL FUNCTION AND SELF MODIFICATION SYSTEM THERE IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WHAT CLASS OF INTELLIGENCE IS REQUIRED TO EMERGE CONSCIOUSNESS

WHAT DOES IT ACTUALLY MEAN TO A COMPUTER TO BE A COMPUTER

I HAD A DISCUSSION WITH A STREET PREACHER ABOUT EVOLUTION AND HOW WHILE IT MAY APPEAR THAT THINGS ARE INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED THIS IS AN ILLUSION WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE ANY SYSTEM OF BALANCING COSTS AND BENEFITS IT WILL SLOWLY OPTIMIZE WITHOUT AND APPEAR INTELLIGENT WITHOUT INTERVENTION THIS IS HOW WE HAVE ADAPTED VARIATION IN SPECIES AND CAPITALIST INNOVATION

SO IN THE MARKET THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF FORCES AND ACTORS THAT IT MAY SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT ORGANIZES ITSELF IT APPEARS TO BEHAVE SORT OF INTELLIGENTLY FROM SOMEONE UNEDUCATED IT MAY SEEM THAT THERE IS SOME MASTER ECONOMIST THAT IS DECIDING WHICH BUSINESSES GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND THESE AMAZING NEW PRODUCTS IT IS VARY EASY TO FORM RATIONAL CONSPIRACY THEORIES BASED ON THESE OBSERVATIONS

BUT I WONDER IF A SYSTEM OF BALANCING COSTS AND BENEFITS IS A MASTER ECONOMIST AND INTELLIGENT DESIGNED MAYBE THERE IS REALLY NO DIFFERENCE THERE IS THIS FOCUS ON ESTABLISHING A DISTINCTION WHEN WE UNCOVER THE MECHANICS BEHIND THE BEHAVIOR IT SEEMS A POPULAR INTERPRETATION OF SCIENCE IS THAT WE ARE DISPROVING THE IDEA THAT A GRAND INTELLIGENCE IS BEHIND PHENOMENA BY SHOWING A NATURAL CAUSE BUT REALLY ALL IT PROVES IS THAT INTELLIGENCE IS NATURAL

SO GENERALLY IF SUCH A CONSCIOUSNESS EXISTS THEN THERE SHOULD BE A SORT OF TURING TEST WE CAN DEVELOP JUST LIKE WE CAN DO FOR CAPITALISM AND EVOLUTION I SUSPECT THAT REALLY IT DOESN'T EXIST I GUESS MY STANDARD IS DIFFERENT IN THAT I DON'T THINK OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND IS RELEVANT IF IT BEHAVES MATHEMATICALLY EQUIVALENT THEN IT IS THIS IS A BETTER AND MORE RIGOROUS DEFINITION IN MY OPINION
YOU MIGHT FIND THIS GOOGLE TALK INTERESTING

CONSCIOUSNESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE JOHN PROFESSOR AT BERKELEY

WATCH V RHKWIYSPXLG
WHEREOF ONE CANNOT SPEAK THEREOF ONE MUST BE SILENT
WHY DO PEOPLE ASSUME THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS IN A BODY OR OBJECT WHAT HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED OUTSIDE OF CONSCIOUSNESS FOR IT TO BE CONTAINED IN
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN

IF WE CREATE A COMPUTER FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF BEING A BRAIN AND EXPERIENCING THE WORLD IT WILL MOST LIKELY EXPERIENCE THE WORLD LIKE A BAT ALIEN ETC MAY EXPERIENCE IT

A IT HANGS ON THE FUZZY MEANING OF THE WORD EXPERIENCE IT IS A WORD THAT MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS

B SOME PEOPLE DISPUTE THAT THERE MAY BE ANYTHING IT IS LIKE TO BE A COMPUTER REGARDLESS OF THE UNDERLYING COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY AND PARTICULAR COMPUTATION THEY BELIEVE TO USE TERMINOLOGY BUT CONTRARY TO HIS CONCLUSION THAT A COMPUTER MAY NEVER BE CONSCIOUS IN THE FULLEST SENSE


WE WON T EVER KNOW BECAUSE OUR LANGUAGE COGNITIVE ABILITY DOESN T ALLOW IT I EAST THE ABOVE QUOTE BY NAGEL

THIS IS A PROBLEMATIC ASSUMPTION INTERFACES ARE ALREADY A STILL VERY PRIMITIVE THING AND MIGHT EVENTUALLY BECOME SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO INVALIDATE THIS ASSUMPTION THOUGH ARGUABLY IT MIGHT ALSO INVALIDATE OPTION

THEREFORE WE CANNOT CLAIM THAT A COMPUTER HAS OR DOESN T HAVE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE

ONLY SO LONG AS YOU USE AN ILL-DEFINED TERM LIKE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE IF THE FOLKS ASSERTING THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS COULD FIGURE OUT AN OBJECTIVE DEFINITION FOR IT WE COULD CREATE A TEST TO VERIFY ITS EXISTENCE IN OTHER BEINGS WITHOUT LEANING ON LANGUAGE AS AN INTERMEDIARY
TO MY KNOWLEDGE IF THE NAGEL QUOTE IS TRUE FOR BATS THEN IT IS ALSO TRUE FOR OTHER HUMANS

FOR INSTANCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCERN WHETHER ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL HUMAN IS CONSCIOUS BASED SOLELY UPON LANGUAGE

YET HUMANS CAN EASILY DISTINGUISH THAT OTHER HUMANS ARE CONSCIOUS AND BATS ARE NOT OR ARE AT LEAST CONSIDERABLY LESS UNLESS YOU ENTERTAIN THE WHOLE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS A DECEPTION AND YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON IN IT THING I BELIEVE WE TERMED EMPATHY BASED UPON THE ABSTRACT CONCEPT OF BEING ABLE TO SIMULATE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE NOT INHERENT TO SELF

IT IS MY BELIEF THAT CONSCIOUSNESS AND SIMULATING SOMEBODY SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE ARE ACTUALLY THE SAME PROCESS EVIDENT BY THE FACT THAT IT SEEMS THOSE MOST CONSCIOUS AWARE ARE ALSO THOSE MOST EMPATHIC EMPATHETIC

ANOTHER READY EXAMPLE IS THAT HUMANS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PREDATORY THAN OTHER MAMMALS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS FOR INSTANCE YOU WILL NOT ACTIVELY HUNT YOUR DOG BEFORE IT ACTIVELY HUNTS YOU

THEREFORE I BELIEVE CONSCIOUSNESS IS MEASURABLE NOT IN HOW WE PERCEIVE A MACHINE TO BECOME BUT SIMPLY WHERE THE IDEA HOW HUMAN IS THIS ROBOT IS DERIVED FROM THE ACTUAL OBSERVABLE MEASURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IS AN ATTEMPT TO ASSESS CONSCIOUSNESS OF SURROUNDINGS

FOR INSTANCE EVIDENCE OF A MACHINE GAINING CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD BE IN IT'S ATTEMPT TO PERSONIFY HUMANS AS OTHER COMPUTERS AS MUCH AS HUMANS ATTEMPT TO PERSONIFY COMPUTERS AS OTHER HUMANS

THIS I BELIEVE SATISFIES AN OBSERVABLE CRITERIA FOR THE DEFINITION OF COMPUTER CONSCIOUSNESS AS FAR AS THE QUALITIES OF THAT CONSCIOUSNESS ARE CONCERNED HOWEVER CAN A MACHINE FEAR OR HAVE EMOTIONS IT REMAINS UNANSWERED BY AT LEAST THIS MUCH
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ANOTHER CREATURE BUT WE DO KNOW THAT OTHER CREATURES EXHIBIT CONSCIOUSNESS IF AN INSECT CAN REASONABLY DEMONSTRATE CONSCIOUS BEHAVIOR WHY NOT A COMPLEX ARTIFICIAL MECHANISM WHO'S TO SAY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS CAN ONLY BE STREAMED THROUGH BIOLOGICAL LIFEFORMS SOMEONE WHO DISCOUNTS THE FUTURE POSSIBILITIES BASED ON PRESENT CAPABILITIES THAT'S WHO
THE LOGIC SEEMS TO HAVE A LEAP MEASURING DOESN'T REQUIRE KNOWING

I DO NOT NEED TO KNOW A MAN TO SEE AN OUTSTRETCHED HAND AND DETERMINE IF I SHOULD SHAKE IT OFFER A GIFT OR WAVE IT CAN MEASURE WHAT THE OUTSTRETCHED HAND IS AND RESPOND

LIKEWISE I DON'T NEED TO KNOW A BAT OR A COMPUTER I CAN MEASURE IT AND IDENTIFY THAT IT IS CONSCIOUS AND IF IT IS CONSCIOUS I COULD REASONABLY ASSUME THAT ALL CONCIOUSNESS IS APPROXIMATELY EQUIVALENT AND UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT CONCIOUSNESS AS IT RELATES TO MINE

I MIGHT NOT NEVER KNOW BUT I MIGHT NOT EVER NEED TO INDEED OUR OWN CONCIOUSNESS IS A STRANGE COMPRESSION ALGORITHM WHERE WE HAVE BOTH MORE AND LESS DETAILED INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT

IF WE CONSIDER CONCIOUSNESS TO BE A SET ANY CONSCIOUS ELEMENT IS A MEMBER OF THE SET OFFERING THE SAME COMPRESSION PARADOX AUTOMATICALLY THERE IS AN INTERSECTION A SHARED MEMBERSHIP THE DEGREE OF INTERSECTION MAY BE ARGUABLE BUT THE MEMBERSHIP WILL BE THERE AND THUS THE CLAIM SAFELY AND ACCURATELY MADE

TO BE CONSCIOUS IS TO KNOW CONCIOUSNESS PERHAPS
WITH CERTAINTY YOU CAN NEVER TRULY HAVE IT HOPE THAT THE EXPERIENCES THAT BRING YOU COMFORT REMAIN CONTINUOUS
IN THE FUTURE WHEN SCIENTISTS MAKE THE CLAIM THAT THE COMPUTER DEVICE THEY HAVE BUILT IS INDEED HAVING CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCES THIS WILL BE AN INFERENTIAL CLAIM AN INFERENTIAL TRUTH INFERENTIAL TRUTH BOTHERS SOME PEOPLE BUT THIS IS THE ONLY TRUTH WE HAVE IN MANY CASES AND IN MOST CASES INFERENTIAL TRUTHS ARE ACTUALLY OBJECTIVELY TRUE
THE WILL OF THE SUFFERER SEEMS TO MATTER IF HE IS FORCED TO SUFFER FOR THE INCREMENTAL PLEASURE OF THE MASSES THAT IS WRONG IF INSTEAD HE CHOOSES TO SUFFER TO BRING JOY TO THE MASSES AS THE SOCCER PLAYERS ARE DOING PERHAPS HIS ACT IS VIRTUOUS AND THE OVERALL TRADE IS GOOD
SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO JULIA MARKOVITS CORNELL UNIVERSITY GIVES AN INTRODUCTION TO THE MORAL THEORY OF UTILITARIANISM UTILITARIANISM IS THE VIEW THAT THE RIGHT MORAL ACTION IS THE ONE THAT MAXIMIZES HAPPINESS FOR ALL

I THINK YOU COULD CHOOSE THE OPTION OF SAVING THE GUY FROM HIS HOUR OF PAIN AND STILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE UTILITARIAN PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMISING WELL BEING BECAUSE A SOCIETY THAT FAVOURS LETTING HIM REMAIN IN PAIN IS ONE WHERE INDIVIDUALS DO NOT FEEL VALUED SOMETHING WHICH WOULD HAVE BROAD RANGING IMPACTS ON BEHAVIOUR AND WELL BEING

THE SAME CAN BE APPLIED TO THE OTHER EXAMPLES THE EXAMPLES GIVEN ARE TOO NARROW IN TERMS OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DECISIONS MADE
THE MAIN PROBLEM FOR UTILITARIANISM IS THE DIFFICULTY IN CALCULATING MAXIMUM VALUE

THIS MAKES UTILITARIANISM A CONVENIENT TOOL EAST G IN POLITICS TO DECIDE WHAT ONE WANTS TO JUSTIFY THEN 2 CONCOCT A SPECULATIVE JUSTIFICATION ABOUT HOW IT MAXIMIZES VALUE

WITH DEONTOLOGY ONE MUST FIND CONSISTENT RULES WHICH SEEMS MORE RIGOROUS AND CHALLENGING
THOSE WATCHING THESE WORLD CUP MAY NOT BE HAPPY TO NOT SEE THE MATCH BUT IMAGINE THEIR SUFFERING AT LEARNING OF JONES FATE
I THINK THE ERROR MADE IN UTILITARIANISM IS THE USE OF INTERPERSONAL COMPARISONS OF VALUE AND THE FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT HAPPINESS IS AN OBJECTIVE STANDARD OF VALUE WITH THESE TWO IDEA TOGETHER IT VIOLATES THE EGALITARIANISM THAT UTILITARIANISM IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE UTILITARIANISM DOESN'T TELL US WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HAPPY OR AT LEAST THE VIDEO DOESN'T NOR DOES IT TELL US WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HAPPIER THAN SOMEONE ELSE IN REALITY HAPPINESS IS PURELY SUBJECTIVE WHAT MAKES ONE PERSON HAPPY DOES NOT DO SO FOR ANOTHER AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOMETHING MAKES PERSON A HAPPY MAY BE DIFFERENT FOR PERSON B NOBODY OTHER THAN THE ACTING INDIVIDUAL CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPINESS IS FOR HIM AND ANY ATTEMPT TO JUDGE HAPPINESS FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE WILL INVARIABLY RENDER A CONCLUSION CONSISTENT WITH HIS ACTIONS AND HIS ACTIONS ALONE UTILITARIANISM BELIEVES IT CAN JUSTIFY THE SAVING OF LIVES OVER BUT HOW DOES IT KNOW WHAT HAPPINESS OR UNHAPPINESS EITHER DECISION PRODUCES IT CAN ONLY BE KNOWN IF WE EXAMINE THE INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES OF EACH PERSON BUT THEN HOW CAN JUSTIFY PUTTING ANY VALUES OF ONE INDIVIDUAL OVER ANOTHER WITHOUT ALSO VIOLATING EGALITARIANISM IN SHORT INTERPERSONAL COMPARISONS OF VALUE SHOULD BE RULED OUT BECAUSE TOGETHER WITH THE FACT THAT HAPPINESS IS SUBJECTIVE THEY VIOLATE THE EGALITARIANISM HOWEVER IF WE ARE TO ACCEPT THIS THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS THAT ALL ACTIONS ARE INHERENTLY GOOD ACCORDING TO THE INDIVIDUAL ACTOR AND THUS UTILITARIANISM LOSES ITS USE AS AN ETHICAL THEORY
I HAVE A QUESTION IS THERE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUFFERING AND HAPPINESS IN UTILITARIANISM HER CASE OF THE SUFFERING MAN AND THE BILLION OF PEOPLE WATCHING FIFA SEEMS TO BE BUILT UPON THE PREMISE THAT THE TWO ARE THE SAME THING
HMM GUESS I WAS ALWAYS WRONG ON WHAT UTILITARIANISM WAS I NEVER KNEW IT WAS BASED ON HAPPINESS WHAT IS IT CALLED IF YOU BASE DECISIONS ON UTILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OVER FEELINGS LIKE HAPPINESS OR CONTENT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HAPPINESS SHOULD BE MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MY HAPPINESS WOULD BE THE SAME AND LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE NEXT PERSON'S JONES IS WORSE OFF THAN ME AND THAT GUY AND THAT PERSON THERE SO WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO TAKE AN AVERAGE IF YOU WERE TO ASK EACH AND EVERY PERSON ONE BY ONE WHAT THEY WOULD WANT YOU TO DO WOULDN'T THE VAST MAJORITY SAY TO HELP JONES

AND NOW I'M WONDERING WHETHER I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING IF THE EXAMPLE WAS ABOUT DEATH AND MUTILATION MAYBE I WOULD THE LOGIC SEEMS TO FOLLOW BUT IT DOES ALSO BEG THE QUESTION DOES EVERY SCENARIO GET TREATED THE SAME WAY AND IF SO WHY BY THE WAY THAT'S NOT ME SAYING IT SHOULDN'T
THE MAIN PROBLEM OF UTILITARIANISM IS THAT IT'S BASELESS I TEND TOWARDS THINKING THAT THERE'S NOTHING INTRINSICALLY GOOD OR BAD THESE ARE JUST SUBJECTIVE STATES OF MIND THAT WE CANNOT REMOVE OURSELVES FROM THE ILLUSION OF

I USED TO BE A MAJOR UTILITARIANISM PROPONENT THEN I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF NOT FEELING MANY EMOTIONS AND IT KIND OF WENT OUT THE WINDOW
THE MAIN PROBLEM IS KINGS COLLEGE STUDENTS TRYING TO STEAL JEREMY HEAD FROM UCL
HEY THIS IS THE BOOK I LIED ABOUT READING ON MY PERSONAL STATEMENT TO GET INTO UNI
I SEE TWO CORE FLAWS IF HAPPINESS IS OFFSET BY SUFFERING THE OBVIOUS SOLUTION IS TO R ED FACE SUFFERING NOT INCREASE HAPPINESS SECONDLY SUFFERING DOES NOT STACK NUMERICALLY IN INTENSITY MILD SUFFERING MULTIPLIED BY ONE MILLION IS STILL ONLY MILD SUFFERING NO MATTER THE QUANTITY TORTUROUS SUFFERING BY JUST ONE IS STILL TORTURE
YOU CANNOT COMPARE THE DELUDED PENGUIN'S HAPPINESS TO THAT OF A PENGUIN WHO IS ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL AND POPULAR BECAUSE THE EXPERIENCE OF A DELUDED PENGUIN WILL NOT RELIABLY EQUAL THAT OF A POPULAR SUCCESSFUL PENGUIN

HE WILL ASK THE GIRL HE THINKS LIKES HIM OUT AND BE HEARTBROKEN

TO SAY THAT ANY LOSER PENGUIN CAN EXPERIENCE THE SAME HAPPINESS AS ANY POPULAR PENGUIN IS MISLEADING BECAUSE ALL PENGUINS BASE THEIR ACTIONS ON THEIR PERCEIVED SITUATIONS

IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT UTILITARIANISM MIGHT FAIL IN A WORLD WHERE MATERIAL CIRCUMSTANCE HAPPINESS LEVEL AND ACTIONS DO NOT INFLUENCE EACH OTHER IN ANY WAY THEN YOU ARE ONE OF THE DELUDED PENGUINS

IN GENERAL I THINK THIS PRACTISE OF DISPLAYING CONSEQUENTIALIST META ETHICS IS ITS NAIVEST FORM POSSIBLE AND POKING HOLES IN IT IS PRETTY REPREHENSIBLE AND EXISTS PRIMARILY TO ALLOW THE RELIGIOUS OBJECTIVE MORAL VALUE PRICKS TO PARTICIPATE IN A DEBATE THAT SHOULD HAVE ENDED CENTURIES AGO

WHETHER OR NOT ETHICAL SENTIMENT IS COHERENT WITHOUT EXPECTED CHANGE IN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED BEING NEGOTIABLE IN WITH ETHICS UTILITARIANISM IS JUST A CONSEQUENCE OF THE OBSERVATION THAT IT ISN'T AND AS THE VIDEO POINTS OUT ITS ONE THAT WE ALL IMPLICITLY LIVE BY REGARDLESS OF BELIEF

THE BULLSHIT POLITICIANS GET AWAY WITH BY APPEALING TO FAMILY VALUES AMERICAN VALUES BRITISH VALUES BLAH FUCKING BLAH RESTS TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON THIS NOTION THAT THERE ARE INTANGIBLE QUALITIES TO HUMAN CONCEPTS LIKE GOOD WHICH YOU CAN'T RELY ON SCIENCE TO REVEAL AND YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK UP THE FACTS ON

ANTI HOMOSEXUAL ANTI ABORTION BULLSHIT RHETORIC THAT HAS NO BEARING ON ANCONES LIFE AT ALL DOMINATES THE FUCKING ELECTIONS WHILE THEY SPEND ALL YOUR TAX MONEY AT THEIR CHUMS WEAPONS EMPORIUM
THE WHOLE MORALITY DISCUSSION DOESN'T EVEN REALLY MAKE SENSE TO ME WHAT ARE THINGS LIKE RIGHT AND WRONG GOOD AND BAD WITHOUT REFERENCE TO A SPECIFIC SET GOAL

EXAMPLE IF MY GOAL IS TO BECOME A RESPECTED MEMBER OF SOCIETY THEN YOU WOULD SAY THAT IT IS GOOD FOR ME TO DONATE TO CHARITY AND BAD FOR ME TO PUNCH OLD LADIES AT THE BINGO HALL BUT IF MY GOAL WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE TO BECOME A MENACE TO SOCIETY THEN SUDDENLY IT'S BAD FOR ME TO DONATE TO CHARITY AND GOOD FOR ME TO PUNCH OLD LADIES AT THE BINGO HALL

I MEAN REALLY WHAT IS RIGHTNESS WHAT IS GOODNESS HOW CAN THINGS JUST SIMPLY BE GOOD WITHOUT IT REFERRING TO A GOAL THAT LITERALLY MAKES NO SENSE THINGS HAVE TO BE GOOD FOR SOMETHING EATING VEGETABLES IS GOOD FOR MY HEALTH SEE I CAN'T JUST SAY THAT EATING VEGETABLES IS GOOD THAT WOULD BE TALK

SO THEN OF COURSE THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHAT OUGHT WE SET OUR GOALS TO BE WELL THOSE ARE JUST SIMPLY GOING TO BE BASED OFF OF OUR DESIRES AND YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT YOU WANT YOU CAN'T WILL YOUR WANTS

SO IF GOODNESS IS BASED UPON GOALS GOALS ARE BASED UPON WANTS AND WANTS ARE A RESULT OF NATURE NURTURE WHENCE COMETH MORALITY UNLESS MORALITY IS REDUCED TO BEING DEFINED AS SHIT THAT ADVANCES MY GOALS YO
THIS IS A VERY EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE JUST ASSIGN AN INFINITELY NEGATIVE AMONG OF DISUTILITY TO SUFFERING
THIS IS RIDICULOUS SOMEONE IS HURT AND NEEDS HELP AND SHE IS WORRIED THAT A MILLION SOCCER HOOLIGANS WILL NOT GET THEIR WAY

THE REAL ARGUMENT IS WHY HAVE WE ALLOWED THE ABSO STUPID DISTRACTION OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS TO HINDER OUR INTELLECTUAL SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT
DELETED
TO BE CLEAR THE FIGURE OF OF SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES BEING NOT REPRODUCIBLE IS EITHER AN INVENTION OR A VERY SLOPPY CLAIM

IT VARIES BY DISCIPLINE FOR INSTANCE YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF IN PHYSICS THAN IN PSYCHOLOGY THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY TOUGH TO CONDUCT A FULLY CONTROLLED STUDY OF HUMAN BEINGS COMPARED TO EAST G ATOMS
2 WHAT IT MEANS TO NOT BE REPRODUCIBLE IS NOT CLEAR IS SOMETHING REPRODUCED WHEN THE SAME CORRELATION STRENGTH IS OBSERVED AS IN THE ORIGINAL IT IS NORMAL FOR A RESEARCHER TO PUBLISH INTERESTING RESULTS EVEN IF THEY TURN OUT WHEN REPRODUCTION IS ATTEMPTED TO HAVE BEEN A CHANCE EVENT SCIENTIFIC READERS FULLY APPRECIATE THAT AN OBSERVATION CAN BE DUE TO CHANCE OR TO FOCUSING ON A FAVOURABLE SCENARIO INSTEAD OF A MORE GENERAL ONE
THERE IS SIMPLY NO DATA THE NUMBER AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IS BASED ON PAPERS ON CANCER RESEARCH THE BIOTECH COMPANY AMGEN HAD A TEAM OF ABOUT SCIENTISTS TRYING TO REPRODUCE THE FINDINGS OF LANDMARK ARTICLES IN CANCER RESEARCH PUBLISHED BY REPUTABLE LABS IN TOP JOURNALS THERE AREN'T ESTIMATES OF A REPRODUCIBILITY CRISIS THAT APPLY TO ALL OF SCIENCE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE TASK IS IMMENSE AND UNDOABLE BY ANY REASONABLY SIZED FUNDED TEAM AND THAT MANY DISCIPLINES DO NOT SEE REPRODUCIBILITY AS BEING A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THEIR FIELD AND THEREFORE DO NOT CONDUCT SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH ON REPRODUCIBILITY

A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION SEEMS TO FOCUS ON WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE SINGLE BIGGEST ISSUE IN PHILOSOPHY RIGHT NOW THE SHEER INABILITY OF TOO MANY PHILOSOPHERS AND THINKERS TO TALK IN ANYTHING BUT ABSOLUTE TERMS AS IN THE CARTESIAN MEDITATIONS BUT WHEN DESCARTES ADOPTED A METHODOLOGICAL HYPERBOLIC DOUBT HE DID SO BECAUSE HE WANTED TO ACHIEVE A SURE BASIS FOR CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE HE MADE IT CLEAR THAT HIS DOUBT WAS A DEVICE WITH A PURPOSE DESCARTES DID NOT BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT CONCEIVABLY BE FALSE SHOULD BE IN PRACTICE TREATED AS SURELY FALSE HENCE EAST G THE ETHICS BY PROVISION

YET PHILOSOPHY SEEMS TO HAVE ADOPTED DESCARTES DOUBT TURNING A METHODOLOGICAL DEVICE INTO A PRACTICAL GUIDE PARADIGM CHANGES REPRODUCIBILITY ISSUES IN CERTAIN FIELDS OR SIMPLY A FRAUDULENT ARTICLE HERE AND THERE ALL SUGGEST THAT SCIENCE AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD ARE IN PRINCIPLE VULNERABLE TO CORRUPTION OR TO NOT MAKING PROGRESS THIS IS GOOD TO KEEP IN MIND PROBLEMS ARISE WHEN PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH TO DENOUNCE SCIENCE AS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED WHEN THE SMALLEST EVIDENCE OF A DEFECT IS GOOD ENOUGH TO THROW THE BABY WITH THE BATHWATER

THE QUESTION THAT IS DEBATED IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THIS ATTITUDE

SHOULD WE SEE SCIENCE AS A FLAWED METHOD AND LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR OUR TRUTHS OR IS IT THE ONLY DIRECT LINE TO REALITY WE VE GOT

THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS NOT PERFECT BUT IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THAT WE MUST DISREGARD IT IT'S NOT DIRECT LINE TO REALITY OR USELESS

BY THE WAY THE SAME APPLIES TO FALSIFIABILITY I LA POPPER AS ALL SELF-RESPECTING EPISTEMOLOGIST INCL KUHN HAVE NOTICED ANOTHER SYMPTOM
YOU'D THINK OF ALL THE ANCIENT CHINESE SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IT WOULD BE RATHER CONFUCIANISM
I BELIEVE ANY DEFINITION OF ART BEYOND IF SOMEONE SAYS IT'S ART IT IS IS TOO CONSTRICTING MORE SPECIFIC RESTRAINTS BECOME MIRED IN VALUE JUDGMENTS YOU SAY RANDOM PIECE IS NOT ART BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET YOUR DEFINITION OR STANDARD RANDOM DUDE SAYS HIS PIECE IS ART SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF TELLING HIM OTHERWISE EXCEPT AS A VEILED ATTACK OR CRITICISM

OF COURSE WHAT YOU THINK OF AS GOOD OR BAD ART IS YOUR SUBJECTIVE OPINION AND BY DEFINITION A VALUE JUDGEMENT YOU DON'T LIKE RANDOM PIECE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET YOUR STANDARDS OF GOOD ART BUT TELLING HIM IT'S NOT ART AT ALL SEEMS PETTY AND ARBITRARY

THAT SAID DEFINITION IS PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE IT GETS AT THE HEART OF WHAT ART DOES BEST CAPTURING AND COMMUNICATING THE INTANGIBLE OR EPHEMERAL ASPECTS OF OURSELVES AND OUR ENVIRONMENTS THAT CANNOT BE PINNED DOWN OR SUMMED UP DIRECTLY OR LOGICALLY THE SUB LAYER OF EMOTIONAL REALITY THAT WE ALL EXPERIENCE BUT WORDS FAIL TO DEFINE UNLESS ARTISTICALLY ARRANGED IN PROSE AND IS COMPLETELY MISSED BY A LOGICAL APOLLONIAN APPROACH TO EXISTENCE

THE ARTICLE'S MAIN CRITICISM IS THAT WHEN THE AUTHOR ALONE IN HIS ROOM THERE ARE NO OTHERS TO RECEIVE HIS JAMMY VIBES

OTHERS ARE INFECTED BY THESE FEELINGS AND ALSO EXPERIENCE THEM

THIS IS IN MY OPINION TAKING THE DEFINITION TO LITERALLY AS IN THIS CASE THE AUTHOR IS HIMSELF THE RECIPIENT HE IS EXPLORING THE NUANCE OF FEELINGS HE HAS EXPERIENCED WITH HIMSELF THROUGH ARTICLE
CAN YOU IMAGINE MAKING ONE INDIVIDUAL STATEMENT AND MORE THAN A YEARS LATER PEOPLE ARE DISCUSSING AND WRITING ESSAYS ON JUST THAT ONE STATEMENT

TOLSTOY SHOWED GREAT INSIGHT INTO HUMAN CHARACTER OBVIOUSLY THIS ONE SENTENCE DOES NOT FULLY DEFINE ART FOR HIM EITHER WE SHOULD CARE FOR OVERANALYZING ONE INDIVIDUAL SENTENCE AND FROM THAT ONE SENTENCE DETERMINE WHAT THAT PERSONS THEORY OF ART IS

WATCH HIGH LEVEL COLLEGE DEBATERS ARGUE THIS THEORY OF ART VS


LIKE MOST ATTEMPTS AT MODERN ART THIS ARTICLE IS A BUNCH OF CRAP WRAPPED IN PRETENTIOUS WORDING WITH REFERENCES AT THE BOTTOM TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE SOME WAS SOME SORT OF DEEP THINK

PROTID DON'T ARGUE WITH TOLSTOY HE'S SUCCEEDED AND HE PROBABLY CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE WHAT HE DID

GOOD ART JUST HAPPENS TO SPEAK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IF YOUR ART IS CRAP OR SPEAKS ONLY TO YOU IT ISN'T ART IT IS JUST SELF-EXPRESSION ARTICLES LIKE THIS ARE JUST BAD ARTISTS TRYING TO JUSTIFY BAD ART AND THEIR CONTINUED EXISTENCE MORE POWER TO YOU IF YOU CAN GET THROUGH LIFE ON THIS BUT DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CONSTRAINTS OF ART BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LIVE A COMFY LIFE PURSING CRAP ARTICLE
FOR ME PERSONALLY THE MORE REALISTIC SOMETHING IS MORE VALUE IT HAS REALISTIC STYLE ART LIKE PEOPLE FACES LANDSCAPES ETC CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DRAW I'VE BEEN MESSING AROUND WITH ART FOR THE PAST YEARS OR SO AND DON'T GET ME WRONG ABSTRACT SHIT AND MODERN SHIT CAN STILL BE DEFINED AS ART BUT OF A DIFFERENT NATURE I'VE MESSED AROUND WITH EVERYTHING FROM PACOS STYLE FACES TO PEN AND INK TO WATERCOLORS SOMETIMES I'LL START DRAWING A PICTURE AND THINK EPHAH THIS LOOKS OFF BUT I'LL JUST KEEP DRAWING AND LET THE AT FIRST REALISTIC PICTURE BECOME NONSENSICAL AND WHAT'S GENERALLY PERCEIVED AS UGLY I FEEL LIKE THIS IS HOW ABSTRACT ART MUST HAVE STARTED BUT HERE'S THE THING IT'S EASY TO FUCK UP DRAWING AND JUST KEEP GOING LETTING IT BECOME ABSTRACT BUT IT'S LEAGUES HARDER TO INVEST THE TIME AND CONCENTRATION TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AND REALISTIC AND REALLY A CHILD CAN SCRIBBLE ON A PAPER AND YOU CAN CALL IT ABSTRACT BUT I WOULDN'T DEFINE THAT AS SKILLED I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS IT JUST ARKS ME THAT PEOPLE ARE LIKE LOOK AT THAT ABSTRACT PAINTING WOAAHHH I'M LIKE DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW EASY THAT IS TO DO DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH HARDER THOUGH TO ME IT'S FUN IT IS TO DRAW SOMETHING MORE REALISTIC

JUST MY OPTION DON'T EXPECT ME TO RESPOND TO ANY ARGUMENTS THOUGH I MIGHT
IT'S JUST A PRANK BRO
PUTTING ASIDE THE ARTICLE AS A WHOLE I WOULD DEFINITELY TAKE ISSUE WITH THE KETCHUP STAIN EXAMPLE THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO SUPPOSE THAT THE STAIN IS ART BECAUSE THE GUEST INTERPRETS IT AS SUCH BUT IT IS NOT ART IT IS PRECISELY A STAIN SURELY PEOPLE CAN HAVE ARTISTIC EXPERIENCES WITH BUT ARTISTIC EXPERIENCES AREN'T NECESSARILY RELIANT ON THE OBJECT BEING ACTUAL ART THEY ONLY HAVE TO BE PERCEIVED AS ARTICLE ART IS RELIANT ON AN ARTIST HAVING MADE IT WITH ARTISTIC INTENT THE ARTIST MAKES ART ART NOT THE AUDIENCE THEY ARE MERELY THE PERCEIVERS
IMO ANY FORM OF EXPRESSION CAN BE ARTICLE IT DOES NOT MAKE EVERY EXPRESSION AS ARTICLE BUT IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU PERCEIVE IT

FOR EXAMPLE IS COMPUTER MUSIC ART IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE IT THERE ARE ALGORITHMS WHICH WILL GENERATE MUSIC THAT HUMANS CAN'T DISTINGUISH FROM HUMAN MADE MUSIC

BUT IS IT ART TO ME IT'S NOT MAYBE TO YOU IT IS
SORRY BUT OUT OF PRINCIPLE I IMMEDIATELY STOP READING ANY PHILOSOPHY POST THAT STARTS WITH ANY VARIATION OF THE PHRASE GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE
ALTHOUGH THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS FURNISHED US WITH THE ABILITY TO GO MANUAL THE MODERN WORLD SEEMS TO CALL FOR FAR MORE MANUAL THINKING THAN WE RE EQUIPPED TO EFFICIENTLY DEAL WITH AND THEREFORE EPISTEMOLOGY IS A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT THE PRACTICAL REASON TO GO MANUAL IS THAT AUTOMATIC COGNITION IS SET UP AND CALIBRATED FOR A MUCH DIFFERENT WORLD THE ANCESTRAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE HUMANS HUNTED WILD GAME GATHERED MYRIAD VEGETABLES AND LIVED AMONG THE CLEAN AIR AND WATER OF THE VIRGIN FORESTS TASTE SENSATIONS ONCE A GREAT INDICATOR OF WHETHER A FOOD WOULD BE HEALTHY TO CONSUME ARE NOW VERY MISLEADING WITH THE PRODUCTION OF REFINED SUGAR INDUSTRIAL SEED OILS AND OTHER UNNATURAL INGREDIENTS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS TURN INTO POPULARITY CONTESTS AS TRIBAL INSTINCTS GO AWRY IN AN ENVIRONMENT SUCH INTUITIONS WERE NEVER BUILT TO HANDLE SOCIETIES OF MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND SO FORTH WHEN WE THINK AND DECIDE WITH OUR EMOTIONS AND INTUITIONS IN A NATURAL SETTING WE OFTEN DO WELL IN A DEEPLY UNNATURAL SETTING OUR BEST CHANCE OFTEN COMES FROM DEVELOPING A RIGOROUS EPISTEMOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK AND APPLYING IT TO THE PROBLEM IN A PAINSTAKING AND PATIENT MANNER

THIS HAS BEEN ON MY MIND FOR YEARS NOW
DOES SKEPTICISM REQUIRE THAT WE REJECT ALL KNOWLEDGE WHILE I CONSIDER MYSELF SKEPTICAL WHICH DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MEAN I AM I CAN AND DO ACCEPT TENTATIVE KNOWLEDGE IN OTHER WORDS KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS A HIGH PROBABILITY OF BEING TRUE BASED ON EVERYTHING ELSE THAT I CURRENTLY KNOW AND CAN REASON IF THOSE CONDITIONS CHANGE MY KNOWLEDGE CHANGES AS WELL

IF A PURELY PHILOSOPHICAL SENSE I THINK IT'S SAFE TO ARGUE THAT TRUE KNOWLEDGE IS IMPOSSIBLE AS I'VE ARGUED ELSEWHERE THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IF SOMETHING IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE WOULD BE TO ELIMINATE ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES SINCE WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING FOR CERTAIN THAT ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN FALSIFIED BOTH BECAUSE WE ARE NOT OMNISCIENT AND BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE FAILED TO CONSIDER SOME OTHER POSSIBILITY THAT NEVER OCCURRED TO US I DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE ABSOLUTE TRUTH IS POSSIBLE FOR HUMANS TO KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS LIKELY THAT SUCH A CONCEPT EXISTS BUT THAT HUMANS SIMPLY CAN'T KNOW IT

THAT DOES NOT MEAN ALL POSSIBLE PROPOSITIONS ARE EQUAL IF MY CAR STOPS RUNNING IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I AM OUT OF GAS BECAUSE I NEGLECTED TO FILL UP MY CAR AND IT RAN OUT DUE TO COMBUSTION IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT GREMLINS ARE HIDING IN MY ENGINE AND SIPHONED OUT ALL THE GAS WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING BUT BASED ON THE METHODS OF SKEPTICISM SPECIFICALLY RAZOR I CAN BE MORE CONFIDENT THE FORMER THEORY THAN THE LATTER EVEN THOUGH I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW IN AN ABSOLUTE SENSE

I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE SHOULD EXAMINE OUR OWN BELIEFS AND WHY WE HOLD THEM THIS IS BASICALLY THE PURPOSE OF EPISTEMOLOGY IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT JUST BECAUSE WE CAN'T NECESSARILY KNOW SOMETHING WITH CERTAINTY WE CAN AT LEAST ELIMINATE THOSE POSSIBILITIES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHERS TO ARRIVE AT THE BEST POSSIBLE TRUTH WE CAN CURRENTLY OBTAIN

AND LET'S FACE IT IF WE ACTUALLY COULD OBTAIN ABSOLUTE TRUTH PHILOSOPHERS AND SCIENTISTS WOULD BE OUT OF A JOB
I'VE DONE A LITTLE RESEARCH INTO THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A NEED TO PROPOSE ANY SORT OF AGENCY TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
ARE THERE ANY PODCAST THAT EXPLORE FREE WILL VS WILL
WHAT KIND OF FREEWILL COMPATIABALIST OR LIBERTARIAN
THE QUESTION IS ULTIMATELY EXISTENTIAL I EAST WHETHER ONE OR THE OTHER EXISTS FOR WHICH THE END OF TIME COULD ONLY DETERMINE HISTORICALLY THINGS ARE BOTH CHOSEN AND DETERMINED OTHERWISE THE QUESTION IS THEN RELATIVE TO THE END AND WHETHER THAT IS CHOSEN OR DETERMINED ANY DETERMINATION AT THIS POINT IN TIME WOULD BE FREELY CHOSEN SINCE WE REMAIN IGNORANT AND IGNORANCE FREES ONE OF ANY DETERMINATION
IS THERE A PODCAST THAT WILL EXPLORE THE FACT THAT FREE WILL AND DETERMINISM ARE JUST WORDS
WHY ARE THERE BEINGS AT ALL INSTEAD OF NOTHING THAT IS THE QUESTION PRESUMABLY IT IS NOT ARBITRARY QUESTION WHY ARE THERE BEINGS AT ALL INSTEAD OF NOTHING THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST OF ALL QUESTIONS OF COURSE IT IS NOT THE FIRST QUESTION IN THE CHRONOLOGICAL SENSE AND YET WE ARE EACH TOUCHED ONCE MAYBE EVEN EVERY NOW AND THEN BY THE CONCEALED POWER OF THIS QUESTION WITHOUT PROPERLY GRASPING WHAT IS HAPPENING TO US IN GREAT DESPAIR FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ALL WEIGHT TENDS TO DWINDLE AWAY FROM THINGS AND THE SENSE OF THINGS GROWS DARK THE QUESTION LOOMS

HEIDEGGER
I WILL ASSUME THAT AT LEAST SOME ABSTRACT PURE SETS PURELY QUALITATIVE PROPERTIES AND RELATIONS POSSIBILITIES POSSIBLE WORLDS IN ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS

WHY WOULD WE ASSUME THERE ARE MULTIPLE POSSIBLE WORLDS AND WHY IF THERE WERE ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS WOULD WE ASSUME THAT LOGIC ITSELF WOULD BE CONSISTENT

I WILL TAKE THIS STATEMENT TO BE TRUE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ILLUSTRATION I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S THE NUMBER WOULD EXIST NO MATTER WHAT

I DISAGREE WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF BEINGS ABLE TO CONCEPTUALIZE NUMBERS THERE IS NO REASON TO ASSUME THAT EXISTS A DOG MAY SEE LEAVES ON THE GROUND BUT WITHOUT LANGUAGE OR A MIND CAPABLE AS FAR AS WE KNOW OF MATHEMATICAL LOGIC THERE IS NO REASON TO ASSUME THAT IS AN INHERENT PROPERTY OF THOSE LEAVES OR THAT THE DOG HAS ANY CONCEPT OF SUCH THINGS MATHEMATICS IS A PROCESS USED TO DESCRIBE RELATIONS BETWEEN OBSERVED OR ABSTRACT CONCEPTS BUT THERE IS NO REASON TO ASSUME THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE OF THE CONCEPTUAL OR PHYSICAL OBJECTS THEY REPRESENT LIKEWISE IT IS EASY TO IMAGINE NOT EXISTING AT ALL IF WE HAD DECIDED ON BINARY RATHER THAN BASE NUMERALS OUR CONCEPTION OF WOULD BE INSTEAD SINCE COMPUTERS THINK IN THIS EXACT METHOD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A COMPUTER'S CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS AN EQUALLY TRUE STATEMENT AND THERE IS NO REASON TO ASSUME SUCH A THING EXISTS BEYOND THE COMPUTER THAT PROCESSED THE VALUE

ONE WAY WOULD BE TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF A
NECESSARY BEING BY A BEING I MEAN A CONCRETE
THAT MAY MEAN

WHY CAN'T THIS NECESSARY BEING SIMPLY BE MATTER AND ENERGY ARGUABLY THE SAME THING BEING IMPLIES SOMETHING WITH WILL AND THERE IS NO REASON TO ASSUME THIS BASED ON EMPIRICAL DATA OR OBSERVATION WE KNOW THAT MATTER AND ENERGY EXIST FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW WE ARE IMPERFECT IF PERFECT HAS A REAL MEANING OBSERVERS OF IT ANYTHING BEYOND EMPIRICAL OBSERVATION IS SPECULATION INDEED SOMETHING BEYOND ENERGY AND MATTER CAUSING ENERGY AND MATTER TO EXIST WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NEVER OBSERVED AT ALL

THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT IS INDISPUTABLY LOGICALLY VALID IT
HAS JUST THE DESIRED CONCLUSION

THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT IS A BROKEN COMPASS ARGUMENT BY THE SAME REASONING I CAN POSTULATE THAT A PERFECT ICE CREAM CONE MUST EXIST BECAUSE THE PROPERTY OF EXISTENCE IS MORE PERFECT THAT THE PROPERTY OF AN OBJECT THAT DOES NOT EXIST IT IS LOGICALLY VALID IN THE SAME WAY THAT ALL UNICORNS HAVE HORNS 2 TWILIGHT SPARKLE HAS HORNS TWILIGHT SPARKLE IS A UNICORN IS LOGICALLY VALID REGARDLESS OF VALIDITY IN NO WAY DOES THE ARGUMENT PROVE THAT OR 2 ARE TRUE IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD

THEREFORE IF OUR FIRST TWO PREMISES ARE TRUE AND IF THE EXISTENCE OF BEINGS ANY BEINGS AT ALL BEINGS OF ANY SORT IS A POSSIBLE STATE OF AFFAIRS THEN IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THERE TO BE A NECESSARY IS TO SAY NECESSITY AND ENTITY ARE COMPATIBLE PROPERTIES

ABSOLUTELY NOT IF THE WORLD WERE DESTROYED TOMORROW AS FAR AS WE KNOW NO BEINGS WOULD EXIST THERE IS NO REASON TO ASSUME THAT THE UNIVERSE WOULD CEASE TO EXIST IF A TINY PLANET IN A REMOTE SECTION OF A GALAXY CEASED TO HAVE BEINGS IN ADDITION WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT FOR ALMOST BILLION YEARS NO THINKING BEINGS THAT WE KNOW OF EXISTED AT ALL THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON TO ASSUME THAT BEINGS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE UNIVERSE AS WE HAVE EVIDENCE THE UNIVERSE EXISTED PRIOR TO ANY BEINGS AT ALL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF ALIEN LIFE IN THE FIRST FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS OF THE UNIVERSE WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO STARS OR PLANETS FOR SUCH BEINGS TO LIVE ON

MORE IMPORTANTLY LOGICAL REASONING ALONE CANNOT OVERRIDE EMPIRICAL DATA WHEN MAKING STATEMENTS ABOUT REALITY I COULD MAKE A LOGICAL CASE THAT GRAVITY IS IMPOSSIBLE USING EXPLANATIONS OF ATOMIC FORCES AND QUANTUM MECHANICS YET NO AMOUNT OF LOGIC WILL CHANGE THE PROPERTIES OF REALITY WHICH INCLUDE GRAVITY

THE ARGUMENT HAS FOUR PREMISES
THERE ARE SOME BEINGS
2 IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE POSSIBLE WORLD THERE ARE INFINITELY
MANY
THERE IS AT MOST ONE POSSIBLE WORLD IN WHICH THERE ARE NO
BEINGS
FOR ANY TWO POSSIBLE WORLDS THE PROBABILITY OF THEIR BEING ACTUAL IS EQUAL

THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THERE ARE INFINITE WORLDS THE UNIVERSE HAD A FINITE BEGINNING HAS BEEN IN IT'S CURRENT FORM FOR A FINITE AMOUNT OF TIME AND HAS EXPANDED AT A FINITE RATE BASED ON EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE UNIVERSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THERE TO BE INFINITE WORLDS A LOT AND INFINITY ARE NOT THE SAME THING AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW THE UNIVERSE IS FINITE SO WHILE THE ARGUMENT IS LOGICALLY VALID AT LEAST ONE PREMISE IS UNTRUE AND SINCE THE CONCLUSION RELIES ON THAT PREMISE THE RESULT IS NOT LOGICALLY SOUND

I HAVE TO GO TO CLASS AND I'LL LOOK AT THIS SOME MORE BUT MY INITIAL READING IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF UNFOUNDED ASSUMPTIONS BUILT INTO THIS ARGUMENT
OH I AM GLAD YOU REPASTED THIS WITHOUT A QUESTION MARK

AND IF THE PROBABILITY OF EVERY WORLD IS

THIS MAKES ME THINK THAT HE IS TRYING TO SAY THAT INF WHICH IS NOT TRUE

THE LIMIT AS X APPROACHES INFINITY OF X IS WHICH IS DIFFERENT
LINK TO EXPLANATION
TO RETURN TO ZENO WHAT IS THE OF HIS ARGUMENT ZENO TAKES HIS ARGUMENT TO BE A REDUCTIO PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF UNCHANGING BEING WHICH PERSISTS IN ITSELF BEYOND THE MISLEADING APPEARANCE OF MOVEMENT

I TAKE THIS TO BE BECAUSE UNLESS THERE IS SOME SUBSTANTIAL BEING THEN THE MOMENTS CAN INFINITELY REDUCE FOR EVER AND EVER AND THE ANCIENT GREEKS SEEM TO AGREE WITH THIS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF ATOMS
PLATO INTRODUCES THE PRIMARY IDEA WHERE THE SOUL LEAVES THE PERISHABLE BODY ONCE IT DECAYS

HOW DO WE KNOW THIS IS TRUE DO WE HAVE ANY RELIABLE EVIDENCE THAT DUALISM IS TRUE

YET NEVERTHELESS WE CAN SEE THAT THE MATERIAL WORLD IS HELD BY AN INFINITE RELATIONS OF LOGICAL FORMS AND THIS PROCESS CULMINATES INTO A PARTICULAR FORM THAT CONSISTS OF ALL FORMS THAT LED TO ITS COMPLETION AND THIS PROCESS GOES ON INDEFINITELY

WHY MUST IT BE IN THIS ORDER ISN'T IT POSSIBLE EVEN LIKELY THAT LOGICAL FORMS EXIST BECAUSE OF MATTER NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND

WHEN THE HUMAN BEING ACHIEVES A CERTAIN FORM OF LOGIC BY SYNTHESIZING HIS INTERNAL RELATIONS MIND WITH HIS EXTERNAL RELATIONS ENVIRONMENT UPON THE DECAY OF HIS PERISHABLE BODY THE LOGIC HE ACHIEVES REMAINS AS THE FUNDAMENTAL FORM THAT DETERMINES THE NEXT GENERATION OF MATTER

WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE THAT THE MIND EXISTS AFTER DEATH CONSIDERING THE LINK BETWEEN COGNITION AND THE BRAIN WHY WOULD WE ASSUME THAT COGNITION IS POSSIBLE ONCE THE BRAIN NO LONGER FUNCTIONS

IN THE INFINITESIMAL LEVEL AND IN THE REALM OF REASON IDEAS ARE LOGICAL FORMS THAT TAKE ON PHYSICAL STRUCTURES IDEAS ARE NOT JUST ABSTRACT BUT THEY TAKE ON FORMS THAT INFLUENCE THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER

WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE HAVE THAT LOGICAL FORMS DO OR EVEN CAN EXIST OUTSIDE OF PHYSICAL MATTER

THESE ARE JUST A FEW QUESTIONS I WOULD ASK BUT IT APPEARS TO ME THAT YOU ARE ASSUMING METAPHYSICS ARE REAL AS IN SEPARATE FROM HUMAN BRAINS AND LOGICAL FORMS IN ORDER TO DISCUSS THE REALITY OF METAPHYSICS THIS APPEARS TO ME TO BE A FORM OF BEGGING THE QUESTION SINCE IT APPEARS THAT THE CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE PROPERTIES OF METAPHYSICS AS THEY RELATE TO PHYSICAL ASSUME THEY EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE AS AN ELEMENT OF THAT REALITY

GENERALLY SPEAKING I AM SKEPTICAL OF ANY PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT REGARDING REALITY THAT DOES NOT RELY ON EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE WITHOUT SOMETHING THAT PREVENTS ALTERNATE IDEAS BASED ON OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE YOU USUALLY END UP WITH A BROKEN COMPASS ARGUMENT

IT'S INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT BUT WITHOUT SOME SORT OF SOLID EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THESE THINGS EXIST I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THEM
SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THE SHORT ANSWER BUT I AS A REALIST DON'T SEEM TO GET THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TOPIC IT JUST SEEMS TO BE A DAYDREAM THAT KEEPS US FROM THE REALITY WE HAVE TO FACE IN EVERYDAY LIFE

ON A POST ABOUT DEMOTIVATIONAL QUOTES A FELLOW REDDITION ONCE QUOTED HIS FATHER SAYING LIFE SUCKS AND THEN YOU DIE

TO ME SOUL OR ANYTHING LIKE IT IS JUST A METHOD OF THE CONSCIOUS BRAIN TRYING TO GRASP IT'S OWN FUNCTION AND NATURE WHILE NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING ITSELF

ALL IT TAKES TO DISTANCE ONESELF FROM SUCH THOUGHTS IS ACCEPTING THAT WE DON'T KNOW AND AT THE SAME TIME ACCEPTING WHAT WE KNOW

WE KNOW THAT WE ARE A COLLECTION OF ATOMS THAT FORM MOLECULES AND THOSE COLLECT TO FORM CELLS AND THOSE FORM OUR BODY AND THEREFORE OUR BRAIN

CONSCIOUSNESS THEREFORE IS JUST THE MANIFESTATION OF A COMBINATION OF CELLS ORDERING THEMSELVES TO THE POINT THAT THEY CAN WORK BETTER AND BETTER TOGETHER TO THE COMMON GOAL OF CONTINUING EXISTENCE FOR EXISTENCES SAKE UNTIL THE COMPLEXITY REACHES A POINT OF COMPUTING POWER THAT CAN UNDERSTAND PARTS OF ITSELF

AT SOME POINT THAT WHAT WE CALL CONSCIOUSNESS NOW WILL BE VIEWED AS MERELY AS INTELLIGENT AS WE VIEW A COLLECTION OF CELLS NOW AND THAT IS THE POINT WHERE REALISM CAN COME IN CONTACT WITH TRANSCENDENCE THOUGH NOT A METAPHYSICAL ONE BUT ONE THAT IS DEFINED BY THE WAY A BEING THINKS AND VIEWS IT'S PREDECESSORS

ONCE HUMANITY OR POSSIBLE SIMILAR LIFEFORMS REACH A POINT WHERE OUR CURRENT INTELLIGENCE SEEMS TO THEM AS MINUTE AS WE SEA THE INTELLIGENCE THAT A FEW CELLS EXIST WE OR THEY HAVE REACHED A NEW LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND TRANSCENDED BEYOND OUR CURRENT ONE
SO I AM NOT CERTAIN I WOULD DEFEND THE EXACT MECHANICS OF THE AUTHOR'S ARGUMENT HE SEEMS TO MAKE POSSIBLY QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE COMMITMENTS OF TRADITIONAL THEISM AND THERE'S A INSERTION OF MORAL NIHILISM WHICH I'M NOT QUITE SURE I SAW THE POINT OF

BUT I THINK HE'S DRIVING AT SOMETHING RATHER IMPORTANT ABOUT DIVINE COMMAND ETHICS THAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY TRIVIAL IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING EXCEPT REPLACE THE WORDS GOOD WITH WHAT GOD WILLS WHICH DOESN'T ADD ANY MEANING TO ANY STATEMENT OR QUESTION OF ETHICS IF ONE WERE TO ASK IS IT BETTER TO ALLOW A TRAIN TO RUN OVER FIVE PEOPLE OR GET IT TO RUN OVER ONE PERSON ONE COULD REPLACE THAT WITH WHICH OF THESE CHOICES WOULD GOD WILL BUT THEN ONE HAS MADE EXACTLY ZERO PROGRESS IN ACTUALLY ANSWERING THE QUESTION

THEISTS MIGHT CLAIM THAT THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF GIVING THEM GREATER MORAL INSIGHT AS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE WILL OF GOD THROUGH THEIR HOLY TEXTS OR PRAYERS BUT ACCORDING TO DIVINE COMMAND ETHICS THIS IS EXACTLY EQUIVALENT TO A CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE GREATER MORAL INSIGHT BECAUSE THEIR HOLY TEXTS ARE GOOD OR THEY HAVE DIVINED WHAT IS GOOD THROUGH THEIR PRAYERS BOTH OF WHICH NEED TO BE ARGUED FOR AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER CLAIM TO KNOW WHAT GOOD IS IF THEY WERE TO TRY TO DEFEND A MAN WHO NEARLY KILLED HIS OWN SON ON AN ALTAR FOR INSTANCE THEY MIGHT SAY BECAUSE IT WAS WHAT GOD WILLED BUT THEN THAT'S EXACTLY EQUIVALENT TO JUST SAYING BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD LITERALLY NO EXPLANATION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN OFFERED JUST A REDEFINITION OF TERMS THAT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE ONE HAS

HECK WE CAN EVEN ALTERNATIVE ETHICAL POSITIONS IN THE SAME WAY UTILITARIANISM COULD BE WHAT GOD WILLS IS FOR US TO MAXIMIZE HAPPINESS AND KANTIAN ETHICS COULD BE WHAT GOD WILLS IS WHAT WE COULD OR WOULD HAVE EVERYONE DO EXACTLY NOTHING HAS BEEN ADDED IN SUCH A ALL THE SAME ARGUMENTS AND CRITICISMS WOULD STILL STAND AND STILL NEED TO BE DEBATED

ALL THAT YOU NEED FOR AN ECONOMY TO WORK WELL IS PEOPLE WHO PURSUE PROFIT SINGLEMINDEDLY I DO NOT CARE WHETHER THERE IS SLAVE LABOR OR ANYTHING AND THAT IS WRONG I HAVE CONCLUDED I ONCE THOUGHT THIS WAS TRUE I WAS ONCE A MARXIST AND MARXISM IS A VERSION OF THIS

THIS STATEMENT COULD NOT BE ANY LESS INDICATIVE OF MARXISM I MEAN THIS IS NEARLY THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY THE CASE WITH HIS PHILOSOPHY

MARXISM IS ABOUT DISREGARDING SELF-INTEREST AND PROFIT BASED MOTIVATION WHICH ARE TWO HALLMARKS OF THE EXACT SYSTEM HE REJECTED CAPITALISM

MARX ENVISIONED A SYSTEM OF UNIFIED WORKERS ALL LABORING UNDER THE SAME BANNER A STRONG COLLECTIVIST SOCIETY WOULD EMERGE INWHICH WORKERS REAP THE REWARDS THEY SOW FREE OF ANY CAPITAL OWNERS THE BOURGEOISIE A MAJOR REASON THEY DECRY PRIVATE BUSINESS OWNERSHIP LIES IN THE IDEA THAT IS INHERENTLY EXPLOITIVE IN ITS NATURE AND A NEW FORM OF IMPOSING ECONOMIC SUBSERVIENCE UPON WORKERS FOLLOWING THE DECONSTRUCTION OF SERFDOM AND THE EMERGENCE OF A MIDDLE CLASS IF MARXISTS OPPOSE THAN IT ONLY FOLLOWS THAT OUTRIGHT SLAVE LABOR WOULD BE OFF THE TABLE AS WELL

I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU USED TO BE BUT WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT IT WASN'T ANY FORM OF MARXISM THAT IS MORE AKIN TO AYN OBJECTIVISM OR LIBERTARIANISM

SHE HAS THE MOST UNUSUAL VOICE IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S PEOPLE SPEAKING AT A TIME

ANYWAY AS TO THE VIRTUES I FEEL LIKE CURIOSITY IS MISSING AND ISN'T ADEQUATELY COVERED BY OVERLAP IN THE ONES SHE DOES DISCUSSION

TO ME CURIOSITY IS PERHAPS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT VIRTUE OVER ANY OF THE OTHERS
BENTHAM IS PRUDENCE ALONE KANT IS JUSTICE ALONE NEITHER OF THEM WORK

THIS IS REALLY BAD PHILOSOPHY UNCHARITABLE SOUND BYTES OF THEIR THEORY IS NOT GOOD PHILOSOPHY I'M SORRY AND YES THEY DO ACTUALLY WORK

JUST AS THE CONTENT STATING PRUDENCE COULD BE A PROBLEM I HONESTLY ALWAYS THOUGHT PRIDE BEING A SIN WAS WEIRD WHAT'S WRONG WITH HAVING JOY IN ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR DELIGHTING IN OTHER PEOPLE'S

I THINK CLEANLINESS AND HYGIENE COULD BE ADDED AS A POSSIBLE EIGHTH VIRTUE I RECENTLY QUIT SMOKING AND I HONESTLY HAD NO IDEA HOW BADLY IT REALLY SMELLED UNTIL I QUIT LONG ENOUGH IF THE BODY IS CONSTANTLY FIGHTING INFECTION AND ON THE OFFENSE WHERE'S THE ROOM FOR GROWTH AND TRUE HAPPINESS
THIS AT FIRST SOUNDS VERY USEFUL BUT I NOTICED THAT THE SYSTEMS SHE LISTED AS EXAMPLES OF BALANCED VIRTUES WERE ALL STRICTLY HIERARCHICAL SYSTEMS WHERE INDIVIDUALS WERE FORCED TO STAY IN THEIR PARTICULAR LEVEL AT BIRTH IN AND THOSE SYSTEMS DID NOT HAVE ANY VIRTUE OF JUSTICE AS I DEFINE THE WORD IN ANY SENSE THAT I HAVE EVER DISCOVERED

THOSE SYSTEMS SHE LISTED ALL REQUIRE A DENIAL OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT IN THE UPPER LEVELS TO HAVE HOPE FOR ANYTHING BUT A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP AND THE NEXT MEAL THOSE SYSTEMS ANCIENT GREECE ROME CHINESE AND HINDU

I THINK ALL THOSE SYSTEMS LACKED JUSTICE AND HOPE FOR ALL BUT A FEW

TO ME SAM HARRIS POSITION AND ARGUMENT IS VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHEN I LISTEN TO DAN DENNETT I CAN'T EVEN WRAP MY HEAD AROUND WHAT HIS ARGUMENT ACTUALLY IS
DANIEL DENNETT IS WRONG ABOUT FREE WILL

HE IS IS HE

THIS IS THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THE FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY THE FACT THAT LAYPEOPLE AMATEURS DILETTANTES FANBOYS DITTOHEADS BLOGGERS WHO ARE INFATUATED WITH THE NOTION THAT THEY DON T HAVE FREE WILL OFTEN FEEL ENTITLED TO CLASH THEIR LITTLE PLASTIC HORNS WITH THE ACTUAL EXPERTS AND PROFESSIONALS OF THE FIELD PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOUGHT DEEPLY ABOUT THEIR SUBJECTS FOR DECADES AND PRETEND THAT THEY ARE PHILOSOPHY EXPERTS THEMSELVES A PRETENSE THAT EXTENDS EVEN TO THE AREA OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE MIND ONE OF THE MOST RECONDITE AND OBSCURE AREAS OF HUMAN INVESTIGATION NOT ONLY DOES THE FACT THAT THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD INCLUDING ONE OF THE WORLD S LEADING AND MOST ACCLAIMED EXPERTS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE MIND HOLD THE VIEW THAT FREE WILL AND DETERMINISM ARE QUITE COMPATIBLE FAIL TO GIVE THESE PRETENTIOUS DILETTANTES ANY PAUSE FOR CONSIDERATION BUT THEY EVEN INDULGE THEMSELVES IN SLINGING MUD AT THESE VERY PEOPLE FOR DARING TO PROPOSE AND HOLD TO A THEORY THAT GOES AGAINST THEIR PERSONAL INTERESTS AND FLIES ABOVE THE CAPABILITIES OF THEIR BRAINS TO FATHOM GIVEN THEIR FAILURE AND INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE IDEAS THAT MAKE COMPATIBILISM WHAT IT IS AND THEIR ABSOLUTE REFUSAL TO BUDGE AN INCH FROM THEIR CHERISHED DOGMA SUCH PEOPLE HAVE NO CARDS AVAILABLE WITHIN THEIR SIGHT OTHER THAN TO IMPUGN THE MOTIVES OF THESE EXPERTS AND CLAIM THAT THEY ARE MERELY DOING SEMANTICS IN ORDER TO APPEASE COMMON FOLK SENSIBILITIES IN OTHER WORDS ACCUSING THE MAJORITY OF ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHERS OF BEING DISHONEST OR NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS AN AMAZING CHARGE GIVEN THAT NOT ONLY IS IT PAINFULLY OBVIOUS THAT IT IS PRECISELY THESE DILETTANTES AND DITTOHEADS WHO DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT BUT THEY ARE CLEARLY THE ONES WHOSE ATTITUDE AND DOGMATIC POSITION WITH REGARDS TO THIS TOPIC AS SOME OF THEM HAVE OCCASIONALLY CONFESSED IS BOTH ANCHORED AND DRIVEN BY PERSONAL AGENDA AND EMOTION THE DESIRE TO BE FREE OF ANY FEELING OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY

WHAT IS ESPECIALLY HILARIOUS IS THE WAY THESE PEOPLE IMPETUOUSLY PASTER THE INTERNET WITH THEIR RESPONSES TO A WRITTEN CRITIQUE GIVING BY A LEADING PHILOSOPHER OF THE MIND BRIEFLY EXPLAINING AND OUTLINING THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPATIBILISM TO SOMEONE WHO IS APPARENTLY THEIR HERO IN SUPERFICIAL THINKING IN THESE RESPONSES USUALLY IN THE FORM OF THEY BEGIN BY PRETENDING THAT THEY HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE CRITIQUE THAT THEY ARE RESPONDING TO THEY THEN EITHER DELIBERATELY OR INADVERTENTLY DISPLAY EXPRESS THEIR ANGER AND DISPLEASURE AT ITS AUTHOR FOR PROPOUNDING A POSITION THAT HAPPENS NOT TO SIT WELL WITH THEM AND THEIR CHAMPION WHOSE MISGUIDED BOOK THEY ADORE THEY THEN GO ON TO SAY HOW MUCH THEY DISAGREE WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE DISSERTATION AND HIS POINTS WHICH THEY OBVIOUSLY DIDN T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND AND DECLARE RATHER COMICALLY THAT THE AUTHOR IS WRONG WHY BECAUSE THEY SAY SO THIS OF COURSE IS USUALLY ACCOMPANIED BY ALL THE OTHER MUDSLINGING ACCUSATIONS ABOUT PLAYING SEMANTICS CHANGING THE SUBJECT BEING DISHONEST AGAIN BECAUSE THEY IN THEIR ALL-KNOWING WISDOM SAY SO

THE FIRST THAT THESE DITTOHEADS AND DILETTANTES HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT OR ANY TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF THE POSITION THEY PRETEND TO BE CRITICIZING IS THE VERY FACT THAT THEY INVOKE THE ACCUSATION OF SEMANTICS IN THE FIRST PLACE IN OTHER WORDS THE DEPTH OF THEIR CONFUSION IS SHARPLY ILLUSTRATED BY THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE THINK OR AT LEAST TALK AS IF THEY THINK THAT THE COMPATIBILIST POSITION IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE HARD DETERMINIST POSITION BUT MERELY EXPRESSED DIFFERENTLY THEY FAIL TO SEE OR SIMPLY DO NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THAT THERE IS A REAL CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO IDEOLOGIES THAT HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES THESE PEOPLE THINK OR AT LEAST LIKE OR PRETEND TO THINK THAT COMPATIBILISTS DO NOT REALLY ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF FREE WILL IN ANY WAY AT ALL BUT MERELY PRETEND THEY DO OF COURSE ONE PROBABLY HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO EMBRACE SUCH A VIEW IF ONE IS SIMPLY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO UNDERSTAND HOW FREE WILL CAN STILL BE A VERY REAL PHENOMENON IN HUMAN NATURE DESPITE THE REALITY OF A WORLD ULTIMATELY GOVERNED BY DETERMINISTIC FORCES SUCH PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PERCEIVE THAT THE PECULIAR TRAITS OF THE HUMAN MIND THAT DISTINGUISH IT FROM MOST OTHER LIVING ORGANISMS SUCH AS SELF AWARENESS AND SUBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS THE ABILITY TO REASON INTROSPECT PLAN AND MAKE JUDGMENTS AND INFORMED DECISIONS HAVE GIVEN HUMANS THE ABILITY TO SUPERSEDE BLIND DETERMINISTIC FORCES IN IMPORTANT WAYS AND TO ACT ESSENTIALLY AS FREE AGENTS IN THE SAME WAY THEY VE BEING ABLE TO OVERCOME MANY OTHER LAWS OF NATURE THEY INSIST ON CONTINUING TO SEE PEOPLE AS MERELY ROBOTS LARGELY BECAUSE THAT IS HOW THEY LIKE TO THINK OF THEMSELVES AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF THEIR CONCEPTUAL DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING COMPATIBILISM OF COURSE IN A TRIVIAL SENSE HUMANS STILL OPERATE UNDER THE LAWS OF DETERMINISM GIVEN THAT THEY ARE PART OF NATURE AND THUS ONE COULD IN PRINCIPLE PREDICT EVERYTHING PEOPLE WOULD DO IF ONE HAD OMNISCIENT INFORMATION THE CONCEPTUAL DIFFICULTY THAT THESE HARD DETERMINISTS HAVE IS UNDERSTANDING THAT AN ENTITY CAN STILL ACT AS A FREE AGENT IN A WAY THAT IS RELEVANT BOTH TO ITSELF AND TO ALL OTHER ENTITIES EVEN THOUGH THE COURSE OF ITS LIFE COULD THEORETICALLY BE PREDICTED BY AN OMNISCIENT BEING

THESE PEOPLE ARE DOGGEDLY FIXATED ON USING NONSENSICAL STRAWMAN DEFINITIONS AND NOTIONS OF FREE WILL WHICH THEY PRETENTIOUSLY PROJECT UNTO THE COMMON FOLK AND WHICH ENABLES THEM TO ASSERT TRIUMPHANTLY THAT FREE WILL DOESN T EXIST AND TO SERVE WHATEVER INTERNAL SATISFACTIONS THEY DERIVE FROM MAKING THAT ASSERTION IN DOING SO THEY FAIL TO SEE THAT FREE WILL IS SIMPLY A COMPLEX HUMAN TRAIT LIKE MANY OTHERS WHICH ARE NEITHER TIME INDEPENDENT OR CONSISTENT AND ARE NOT POSSESSED BY EVERYONE TO THE SAME DEGREE YET WHEN IT ALL COMES DOWN TO IT WHEN YOU STRIP AWAY ALL THE FLUFF AND FEATHERS THE ENTIRE POSITION OF THESE NO FREE WILL ENTHUSIASTS RESTS UPON A SINGLE THAT THEY REGULARLY INVOKE AS A TRUMP CARD WHERE DOES A PERSON S WILL AT ANY TIME COME FROM THE WORD OFTEN USED IS DESIRES BUT IT WOULD ALLOW MUCH MORE CLARITY IF IT WERE EXPRESSED MORE GENERALLY AS WILL IN OTHER WORDS THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT OF THESE PEOPLE IS PREDICATED UPON THE SINGLE NOTION THAT A PERSON S WILL AT ANY TIME IS ULTIMATELY DUE TO FACTORS BEYOND HIS HER CONTROL OR CHOOSING OF COURSE THEY WILL TYPICALLY CEMENT THIS ARGUMENTATIVE TRICK WITH ANOTHER SLEIGHT OF HAND IN THE FORM OF SOME KIND OF INFINITE REGRESSION WHERE DID THE WILL THAT LED TO THAT WILL COME FROM AND THE WILL THAT LED TO THAT ONE AND THE ONE THAT LED TO THAT ONE AND SO ON AND SO ON THUS ACCORDING TO THESE NOT VERY BRIGHT BUT OBNOXIOUSLY PRETENTIOUS DORMROOM PHILOSOPHERS THE LUXURY OF BEING ABLE TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ONE S WILL AND SENSE OF SELF INTERESTS IS NOT ENOUGH TO QUALIFY AS FREEDOM OF WILL ONE ALSO HAS TO BE ABLE TO SNAP ONE S FINGERS AND CONJURE INTO THE DRIVER S SEAT OF ONE S PSYCHE AN ARBITRARY WILL STRAIGHT OUT OF THIN AIR ONE THAT THEY HAD NO PRIOR INCLINATION WHATSOEVER TO CONJURE OTHERWISE IT WOULDN T BE FREE AND IT MUST T BE A RANDOM EVENT EITHER OR IT STILL WOULDN T BE FREE THEREFORE THIS ARBITRARY WILL MUST BE BOTH WILLED AND UNWILLED AT THE SAME TIME ONLY THEN CAN SOMEONE HAVE FREE WILL ONLY THEN CAN SOMEONE EVER HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY OF THEIR ACTIONS THIS IS THE KIND OF TOMFOOLERY THAT OCCUPIES THE BASE OF THESE PEOPLE S MINDS WHEN DABBLING IN THIS SUBJECT

OF COURSE THEY CAN ALWAYS FALL BACK ON THE VERY NOTION OF DETERMINISM ITSELF IF THE TRUMP CARD DOESN T WORK AND WHAT IT SEEMS TO THEM TO MEAN THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE SIMPLY ROBOTIC AUTOMATONS OF NATURE WHOSE THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS ARE DETERMINED BY A DOMINO EFFECT OF CAUSES AND WHO MERELY LABOR UNDER THE ILLUSION THAT THEY ENJOY WHAT THEY CALL FREE WILL WHEN THEY REALLY DON TENSE IT IS THE SORT OF CONCLUSION THAT MAKES THE CHESTS OF DORMROOM AND BEER PARLOR PHILOSOPHERS SWELL WITH PRIDE AND PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK FOR SEEING SOMETHING SO INSIGHTFUL HUMAN BEINGS THUS ARE MERELY AT LEAST WHEN THEY ENJOY THIS ILLUSION PUPPETS THAT LIKE THEIR STRINGS INCIDENTALLY IS A PUPPET THAT LIKES ITS STRINGS ESSENTIALLY FREE OR ISN T IT MEANWHILE THESE SELF-CONGRATULATING RETARDS FAIL TO SEE THAT THEIR POSITION IS EVERY BIT AS OBTUSE AS SAYING THAT A CANVAS IS NOT REALLY A BEAUTIFUL PAINTING FEATURING A LOVELY SCENERY WITH HUMANS AND VARIOUS OBJECTS WHY BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY AT IT IT IS MADE UP OF TINY LITTLE DOTS

TYPICALLY HARD DETERMINISTS ESPECIALLY THESE DILETTANTE TYPES ARE USUALLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME TO SOME PERSONAL REALIZATION ABOUT A BASIC FACT ABOUT THE WORLD AND BIOLOGICAL LIFE INCLUDING HUMAN BEINGS THAT HAS LONG BEEN TRIVIAL AND OBVIOUS TO OTHER PEOPLE AND FEEL AS THOUGH THEY HAVE DISCOVERED SOMETHING REVOLUTIONARY AND PERSONALLY EXHILARATING THIS FOR SOME REASON GIVES THESE AMATEURS A TENDENCY TO FEEL ENTITLED TO BROWBEAT THE WORKS OF MUCH MORE THOUGHTFUL MINDS THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE SUBJECT LONG BEFORE THEY EVEN KNEW THAT SUCH A SUBJECT EXISTED THIS TENDENCY MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SENSATION OF DISCOVERY AND CONCLUSIVENESS THAT SUCH PEOPLE TEND TO FEEL ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF DETERMINISM AS IT SWIMS AROUND IN THEIR HEADS AND A NAIVE AND PRESUMPTUOUS BELIEF THAT THEY HAVE REACHED SOME KIND OF PLATEAU OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN MIND RATHER THAN JUST THE FOOT OF A LONG STEEP

NO LOVE FOR ZIZEL IN R PHILOSOPHY
IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THIS COURSE WILL BE INTRO LEVEL I'M DEFINITELY INTERESTED BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE COURSE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS I STUDIED UP ON
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

I THOUGHT THE ANSWER WAS OF COURSE

EVEN IN THE U SOUTH THERE ARE INCURABLE AND EXTREMELY PAINFUL CONDITIONS WHERE PARENTS ARE GIVEN THE OPTION ON WHETHER TO PURSUE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS OR TO TAKE THEIR CHILD OR BABY HOME MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE AND WAIT

THERE ARE CHILDREN IN HOSPICE

THERE IS NO REASON AN INFANT OR CHILD SHOULD SPEND SIX MONTHS EITHER IN A DRUG INDUCED COMA OR IN SCREAMING AGONY BEFORE THAT TINY HEART GIVES OUT THERE IS NO COMPASSION OR KINDNESS IN SQUEEZING OUT EVERY LAST DROP OF AGONY FROM A VICTIM WHO CANNOT ESCAPE THE FINAL RESULT OR EVEN PUT IT OFF A BIT THERE COMES A POINT WHERE DEATH IS THE ONLY MERCY THE PARENTS OR MEDICAL STAFF IS CAPABLE OF OFFERING

OF COURSE PERMANENT SOLUTIONS SHOULD NEVER BE OFFERED FOR TEMPORARY PROBLEMS BUT WHEN AGONY IS ALL THAT'S LEFT MAYBE OUR SOCIETY CAN STAND TO SPARE OUR MOST VULNERABLE A LITTLE SUFFERING
FROM WHAT I'VE RESEARCHED A FEW YEARS AGO SOME CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE TERMINAL ILLNESSES OR HAVE EXPERIENCED IT WITH A LOVED ONE UNDERSTAND THE PERMANENCE OF DEATH AT QUITE A YOUNG AGE IT IS TIED IN WITH THEIR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT STAGES OF OF OBJECT PERMANENCE AND CONCRETE REASONING OBJECT PERMANENCE IS FIRST EXPERIENCED IN INFANCY AND CONCRETE REASONING STARTS AROUND AGE SOME ACHIEVE THIS STAGE YOUNGER AND SOME OLDER IT'S BEEN OBSERVED THAT CHILDREN WITH TERMINAL ILLNESS OFTENTIMES MAKE GREAT GAINS WITHIN THIS DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE EARLIER AND MORE FULLY POSSIBLY DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF DR VISITS THEIR SYMPTOMS AND THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH THEM THIS HAS BEEN SEEN WITH CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE AT OR BEFORE THIS STAGE THERE'S BEEN CASES OF KIDS AS YOUNG AS WHO SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT DEATH IS PERMANENT AND NOT REVERSIBLE I SUSPECT THAT TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES ACTUALLY FACILITATE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS I THINK IT'S FREAKING FASCINATING HOW OUR ENVIRONMENT CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE PHYSIOLOGY OF OUR BRAINS

I DO HAVE A PERSONAL BIAS TOWARDS THIS ISSUE SINCE MY NIECE AND NEPHEW BOTH HAVE ABIA THIS IS A HORRIBLE RARE DISEASE THAT CAUSE SUCH PHYSICAL CONTRACTIONS CAUSE BONES TO BREAK IT'S A NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE SO PAIN AMEDS DON'T GET PAST THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER THEY'VE BEEN PUT IN A TWILIGHT LIKE STATE WITH SOME TYPE OF DON'T KNOW WHAT WHEN MY NEPHEW WAS AT THE POINT OF NEEDING A RESPIRATOR FULL TIME HE WENT INTO HOSPICE HE'D LIVED IN PAIN WELL PAST THE AGE OF WHEN WE THOUGHT HE WOULD DIE GRANTED HE WAS BUT HE HAD THE EMOTIONAL AGE OF ONE MUCH YOUNGER MY SIL TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PUT HIM TO SLEEP TAKE OUT THE RESPIRATOR AND THEN HE WOULD WAKE UP IN HEAVEN SO THAT'S WHAT THE DR DID

EXCEPT IT DIDN'T WORK RIGHT MY NEPHEW DIDN'T DIE FROM THE COMBINATION OF THE DRUGS AND HIS DISEASE THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM ENOUGH MEDICATION AND HE WOKE UP IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN AND HE WAS PISSED HE WANTED TO DIE SO BADLY I AM DEF ON THE SIDE OF LETTING CHILDREN BE INVOLVED IN AND MAKE END OF LIFE DECISIONS AS LONG AS THEY HAVE THE COGNITIVE YEAH IT'S IS SUGGESTED THAT EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY MEDICAL TEAM INCLUDING COUNSELORS FRIENDS AND SPIRITUAL ADVISORS MAKE THE DECISION ALONG WITH THE CHILD WHO HAS REACHED THIS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT

WHIST I THEORETICALLY AGREE IT'S SCARY TO THINK OF HOW PARENTS COULD EASILY INFLUENCE THIS DECISION WHO KNOWS HOW AN YEAR OLD WOULD RESPOND IF THEIR PARENTS ARE TELLING THEM THAT EUTHANASIA IS THEIR BEST OPTION
CHILDREN CAN HAVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS TOO THAT CAN MAKE THEM TERMINALLY ILL WHEN THEY KNOW THEY WON'T LIVE TO ADULTHOOD SO THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE SAME WAY AN ADULT CAN FOR WHEN THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE CHILDREN SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SUFFER FROM INCURABLE THINGS LONGER JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE CHILDREN BECAUSE AGE AND DEATH ARE NOT LIMITED TO OR BY AGE AND CHILDREN CAN HAVE INCURABLE DISEASES AND MEDICAL ISSUES TOO
I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE THERE IS NO SINGLE RIGHT ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHEN WE FOUND OUT MY DAUGHTER HAD LEUKEMIA WHEN SHE TURNED THERE WAS NO QUESTION IN OUR MINDS WE WOULD DO WHAT WE COULD TO HELP HER GET BETTER WE FELT THAT EVENTUALLY HER QUALITY OF LIFE WOULD RETURN IF THE TREATMENTS WORKED AND IT WOULD BE WORTH IT

LONG STORY SHORT HER LITTLE BODY WAS PUSHED TO THE BRINK OF CELLULAR DEATH BEFORE SHE RECEIVED HER BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT THANKS TO THE AWESOME HOSPITAL STAFF WHO TOOK CARE OF HER SHE IS YEARS CANCER FREE

BUT THE EFFECTS OF THE CHEMO AND RADIATION ARE STILL PRESENT I WON'T GO INTO IT NOW BECAUSE THIS POST IS GETTING TOO LONG

FAST FORWARD YEARS AFTER THE LEUKEMIA SCARE WE WERE PREGNANT AND EXCITED I FOUND OUT IN MY 7TH MONTH OF PREGNANCY OUR CHILD WAS GOING TO BE BORN WITHOUT A BRAIN

DEVASTATED BY THE NEWS WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION FOR OUR SOON TO BE BORN DAUGHTER WE ENDED UP TAKING HER HOME FOR HOSPICE CARE WHERE SHE PASSED SHORTLY

WE CHOSE NOT TO TAKE ANY EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES BECAUSE HER QUALITY OF LIFE WAS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO IMPROVE WE CHOSE TO LET HER DIE BECAUSE WE KNEW SHE WOULD NEVER REALLY LIVE

EVERY CASE IS DIFFERENT EVERY DECISION IS INDIVIDUAL TO THE FAMILIES OF THE LOVED ONES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THE DIFFICULT CHOICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN

OF COURSE MY FOUR YEAR OLD WOULD HAVE CHOSE TO STOP HER THERAPY IT WAS PAINFUL IT WAS SCARY BUT WHAT CHILD WOULDN'T WANT THOSE THINGS TO STOP AS PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE AND HEALTHY EVEN IF IT MEANS PROTECTING THEM FROM THEMSELVES

TL R HAD TWO TERMINALLY ILL DAUGHTERS WE MADE WHAT WE FELT WERE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS CONCERNING THEIR CARE
I AGREE THEY SHOULD JUST LIKE ADULTS WHERE I AM FROM EUTHANASIA ISN'T A THING WHY I THINK SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE AGAINST IS THE MISUNDERSTANDING THAT A KID CAN JUST DECIDE THAT HE SHE DOES NOT WANT TO LIVE ANY MORE SCHOOL IS TOO HARD LET THE DOCTORS KILL ME IT IS A DECISION MADE BY MANY PEOPLE DOCTORS AND PSYCHIATRISTS AND USED AS A ABSOLUTE FINAL SOLUTION
I JUST WROTE A LENGTHY RESEARCH PAPER ON THE RIGHT TO DIE MOVEMENT AND WHILE IT'S HARD TO LET OUR LOVED ONES GO THEY FUCKING KNOW WHEN IT'S ENOUGH AND WHO ARE WE TO MAKE THEM SUFFER CHILDREN HOWEVER MAY NOT KNOW BUT WHO ARE WE TO MAKE THEM KEEP ON WHEN THEY'RE SUFFERING NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO PROLONG MY DEATH JENNIFER GLASS THAT SORT OF COMPASSION SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE
DELETED
DEPENDS IF THEY'RE IN EXTREME PAIN AND THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THEM YES IF THEY AREN'T THEN NUMBER
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE TO DIE WHENEVER THEY LIKE WE TREAT HUMAN LIFE LIKE IT'S SOME SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR DIE MORE THAN MILLION OF THEM CHILDREN UNDER I THINK EUTHANASIA SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO DIE FOR ANY REASON IT'D BE A LOT NICER THAN COMING HOME TO FIND YOUR FAMILY MEMBER HANGING IN THE GARAGE BECAUSE THEY WERE TIRED OF LIVING THIS LIFE EVERYONE DIES EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE HEALTHY OR NOT WHEN TO HUMANELY END LIFE IN THE END WHO CARES WE'RE SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE WHEN SOMEONE ELSE DIES WHEN IN REALITY ONLY ONE PERSON SHOULD HAVE THAT CHOICE AND THAT'S THE PERSON WHOSE LIFE IT IS CHILD OR NOT ONE LESS PERSON ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF OUR FUTURE AND PERHAPS IT WOULD REMOVE SOME OF THE STIGMA AROUND DYING
THIS SHOULD STILL BE A PARENTS DECISION AS IT IS THEIR DUTY TO LOOK OUT FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD SO LONG AS THEY AREN'T REFUSING TREATMENTS FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS A POSSIBLE CURE THEY SHOULD DO AS THEY SEE FIT RATHER THAN MAKE THE CHILD FACE THE REALITY OF DEATH AT SUCH A YOUNG AND NAIVE POINT IN THEIR LIVES WE SHOULD TRY TO COMFORT THEM DURING THESE TRIALS THAT ARE FACING THEM WHETHER IT'S THROUGH TREATMENTS OR THE PARENT DECIDES THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO
PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT DISTINCTIONS CAN AND ARE BE MADE BETWEEN CHILDREN OF DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND AGES SEE HERE FOR DISCUSSION RE NEWBORNS
WHEN YOU SUFFER AS THEY DO YOUR OPINION CAN COUNT
IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO CONSENT THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN DO NOT POSSESS THE INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY OR DEVELOPMENT TO CONSENT ASSENT PERHAPS BUT NOT CONSENT USUALLY THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN IS CONSULTED AS THEY ARE THE INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS OR AT LEAST SHOULD HAVE THE BEST INTEREST AT HEART A SIMILAR SYSTEM WOULD LIKELY BE APPROPRIATE IN REGARDS TO THIS ISSUE
NOT BY CHOICE
THERE ARE CHILDREN WHO COMMIT SUICIDE ANYWAY THEY EASILY UNDERSTAND DEATH THEY'RE FORCED TO KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED ARE DYING OR WILL DIE IT'S UNDERSTOOD DURING THE FIRST DEATH THEY EXPERIENCE A CHILD OF TERMINAL ILLNESS KNOWS THIS EVEN BETTER BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE EFFORTS ONLY GIVE THEM X MORE TIME LEFT I THINK THEIR OPINIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THEY AREN'T ANIMALS THAT CAN'T SPEAK SURE A CURE MAY BE JUST AROUND THE CORNER BUT MAYBE LIFE JUST ISN'T FOR THAT PARTICULAR CHILD I'M NOT SAYING NOT TO FIGHT I'M SAYING TO LET IT BE THE DECISION BECAUSE IT'S THEIR LIVES NOT ANYONE THAT HAS TO LIVE THROUGH THE PHYSICAL PAIN AND EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER OF PITYING THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO STICK BESIDE THEM
WELL I WAS WONDERING WHEN THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN
EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO DIE WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE

DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO ARBITRARILY END THEIR LIVES OR THE LIVES OF OTHERS DO THEIR PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO END THEIR LIVES

THE DOCTORS

SHOULD HOPE BE LEGISLATED OR LEGISLATED AGAINST

THESE ARE DEEP QUESTIONS AND I FORESEE A HARD TIME GETTING A SERIOUS ANSWER ON REDDIN

WHETHER OR NOT DEATH IS AN APPROPRIATE SOLUTION IS GOING TO OVERSHADOW THE QUESTION OF IF CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO EXECUTE THE DECISION

I THINK IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO LET CHILDREN MAKE THAT DECISION ESPECIALLY ON THAT SITUATION

REALISTICALLY THEY ARE GOING TO BE COERCED PERSUADED BY THEIR PARENTS

I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD BE WILLING TO LET KIDS HAVE THE OPTION UNLESS A DOCTOR AND PARENT AGREED IT WAS AN OPTION AND IN THAT SITUATION WOULDN'T THE ADULTS SIMPLY BE ASKING THE CHILD TO AGREE

I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE STOPPED BELIEVING IN SANTA FOR A DECADE BEFORE YOU'RE ALLOWED ANYWHERE NEAR THAT KIND OF DECISION
REMOVED
IF WE CAN TAKE LIFE FROM THEM WITHOUT PERMISSION WHY CAN'T WE TAKE IT WITH THEIR PERMISSION
UH NUMBER

ONLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO DRINK OR VOTE OR BASICALLY BE A LEGAL ADULT

YOU CAN'T SAY SOMEONE LACKS CAPACITY TO SELF GOVERN BUT TOTALLY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DECIDE ON SUCH A SERIOUS MATTER

THEN TALK ABOUT OUTSIDE INFLUENCE PARENTS AND FRIENDS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BEINGS THAT OFTEN THINK SANTA IS REAL AND WILL BELIEVE WHATEVER THEIR PARENTS AND FRIENDS SAY DO WE REALLY THINK THEY ARE TOO DUMB TO REMEMBER TO TAKE A BATH YET SUDDENLY ARE INSIGHTFUL ENOUGH TO CONTEMPLATE THEIR OWN MORTALITY AND DECIDE UPON IT

IT'S STUPID TO BE SO CONTRADICTORY IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER THEY ARE EITHER MINORS OR THEY ARE NOT
YOU RELIGIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD STOP PRESUMING YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE FOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT SHARE YOUR CHOICE OF SUPERSTITION
WHY IS DEATH TABOO EVERY PERSON WHO HAS EVER LIVED HAS OR WILL DIE WE ARE ALL DYING ALBEIT AT MUCH DIFFERENT RATES IF WE CONCEDE THAT DEATH IS SIMPLY NON EXISTENCE THEN HOW CAN WE PAINT IT NEGATIVELY NON EXISTENCE IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD IT'S NOTHING IF A PERSON WAS TO ENDURE UNBEARABLE SUFFERING FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A NORMAL LIFE IN THE FUTURE NORMAL LIVES ARE CONSTITUTED OF BOTH PAIN AND PLEASURE WHY IS DEATH NOT A GOOD OPTION LET'S EVEN ASSUME THAT THEIR LIFE WAS TO CONSIST OF PURE ECSTASY THEY ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING EVEN IF THAT WAS THE CASE IS DEATH STILL NOT PREFERABLE NON EXISTENCE DOES NOT EQUATE I DON'T THINK WITH FLOATING THROUGH THE ETHER REMINISCING OVER THE PLEASURABLE LIFE YOU COULD HAVE EXPERIENCED HAD YOUR LIFE NOT BEEN TERMINATED THERE IS NOTHING

ONE REMAINING ISSUE IS THAT WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS EVEN IF WE ACCEPTED THIS PREMISE EMOTIONAL BONDS WITH THOSE WE LOVE ARE NOT EASILY SEVERED AND FOR GOOD REASON IT IS PAINFUL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT LIFE MIGHT BE LIKE IF A PARTICULAR LOVED ONE WAS STILL AROUND NOT JUST FOR THE REASON OF THAT LOVED ONE'S OWN PLEASURE BUT FOR THE PLEASURE THEY BRING TO THOSE WHO MUST STILL LIVE

THERE WAS A VIDEO POSTED ON THIS SUB A WHILE BACK DONE BY ADAM PIERCE ON THE HEDONISTIC IMPERATIVE THOUGHT PROVOKING STUFF HOW ONE DAY WE MIGHT GENETICALLY ENGINEER HUMANS TO LIVE MORE PLEASURABLY
THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE WHO DON'T SUPPORT RIGHT TO DIE I DON'T SEE WHY IT'S WORTH IT TO DISCUSS IF CHILDREN SPECIFICALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO
IN BELGIUM WE HAVE A KIDS EUTHANASIA LAW IN PLACE SINCE IT WAS FIRST PRACTICED A HALF YEARS LATER

AS A PARENT MYSELF I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HAVING TO ON A GRUELING DECISION LIKE THAT I DON'T THINK I WOULD OR COULD EVER COME TO PEACE WITH MYSELF IF EVER FORCED TO TAKE A DECISION LIKE THAT HOWEVER I FIND COMFORT THE LAW IS THERE IF EVER REALLY NEEDED

EDIT READ THE LINKED ARTICLE AFTER MY POST
I ACTUALLY HAVE A TERMINAL ILLNESS AND HAVE BEEN ON MY DEATH BED QUITE A FEW TIMES ESPECIALLY AS A YOUNG CHILD CYSTIC FIBROSIS LET ME TELL YOU NO AMOUNT OF PAIN WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE DEATH SEEM LIKE AN OPTION AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE AS I GOT OLDER IN MY S I'VE EXPERIENCED PAIN THAT I'VE SAID YEP KILL ME OR GIVE ME PAINKILLERS CAUSE SHITS FUCKED BUT AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE WITH SO MUCH OF MY LIFE TO GO THE TIME IS EXPONENTIALLY PRECIOUS


OF COURSE THIS IS MY SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE I THINK YOU'LL FIND MOST KIDS ARE TOO AFRAID TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND EVEN MORE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FINALITY TO MAKE THE DECISION ALL THIS BEING SAID I THINK IF A CHILD IS SUFFERING IMMEASURABLY WE SHOULD GIVE THEM PEACE OF COURSE IT'D NEED TO BE CONFIRMED BY A DOCTOR BECAUSE A CHILD MAY THINK X IS WORSE THAN IT IS BUT YEAH
NO THE HUMAN BRAIN ISN'T FULLY DEVELOPED UNTIL LATER IN LIFE MOST NOTABLY THE FRONTAL LOBE ISN'T DEVELOPED UNTIL AGE THE PART OF THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR HIGHER LEVEL THINKING CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER HAVE THE FINAL SAY IN DECISION MAKING
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF RIGHTS PRIMARILY BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT AND THE PUNISHMENT IS SELF INFLICTED

THE QUESTION IS AS A COUNTRY SHOULD YOUR LAWS AND MORALS REFLECT THAT YOU WOULD BE OK WITH SUCH HORRIBLE ACTIONS

IT IS BEST FOR SOCIETY WHEN IT IS ILLEGAL TO KILL CHILDREN AND YET MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS PARENTS DO SO ANYWAY

CHILDREN WILL DIE WHETHER OR NOT OR NOT RIGHTS ARE ASSIGNED THE QUESTION THAT REMAINS WHAT IS THE SPACE FOR INDIVIDUAL ACTION

FIRST I HOPE WE CAN AGREE THAT CHILDREN ARE PROXY DECIDERS FOR THE ADULTS AROUND THEM IT IS THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN VILLAGE IF ADULTS DECIDE TO KILL A CHILD A CHILD WILL DECIDE TO KILL ITSELF HOPEFULLY WE CAN AGREE THE QUESTION OF CHILDREN DECIDING THEIR OWN FUTURE CAN BE PUT TO BED

WHEN ADULTS MAKE LEGAL DECISIONS ABOUT CHILDREN A TONE IS SET IN SOCIETY A MEASURED DOOR OPENS TO A SLOPE WHERE ADULTS WILL LATER DISAGREE ON WHEN AND WHY AN ISSUE IS OK IN SOME CASES AND NOT OK IN OTHERS VALUES AND ETHICS CHANGE WITH THE TIMES AND WHAT IS ANTHEMA TO ONE GENERATION BECOMES STANDARD PROCEDURE TO ANOTHER

WHEN IT COMES TO LIVES OF CHILDREN THE PROBLEM IS WE CANNOT TRUST ADULTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING AT ALL TIMES EVEN IF A MERCY KILLING IS JUSTIFIED THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE SCOPE OF MERCY KILLINGS WILL EXPAND BEYOND THE JUSTIFIABLE SOCIETY MUST BE EVER VIGILANT AND SO PERHAPS IT IS BEST IF LEGALLY NO CHILDREN ARE ALLOWED TO ALL

THE SCOPE DISCUSSION CHANGES FROM WHEN IS IT OK TO KILL TO WHY WASN'T MORE SUPPORT GIVEN THIS IS A BETTER QUESTION FOR SOCIETY TO BRINGS US CLOSER TO THE IDEAL

I SAY THIS KNOWING FULL WELL THAT TODAY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND PARENTS DECIDE TO ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO CONSCIOUSLY OR SUBCONSCIOUSLY SUCH SHADOW ACTIONS LEAVE NO STAIN ON PARENT DOCTOR OR SOCIETY PERHAPS FOR NOW THAT IS THE BEST WE CAN MANAGE


I DONT WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT
DEATH CAN BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED IT'S NOT A RIGHT THAT CAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM SOMEONE LIKE A PHYSICAL BELONGING

THE CHILD WILL MATURE AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS THE CHILD IS DEAD BORN AGAIN AS AN ADOLESCENT UNKNOWING THAT ONE DAY THE PROCESS WILL REPEAT ONLY THIS TIME THEIR TEENAGE HUSK WILL PRODUCE AN ADULT

IT IS CERTAIN
THIS IS THE SAME GUY WHO ADVOCATED FOR ABORTIONS FOR THE DISABLED

I'M A RATHER DEVOUT CHRISTIAN AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS AFTER READING THAT POST

IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO ME THAT NOT EVERYONE BELIEVES IN GOD BUT OF COURSE THAT'S THEIR DECISION IF THEY WANT TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO SIN THEY MAY BE PERMITTED TO DO SO BUT THEY WILL NOT BENEFIT FROM IT AND I WILL NEVER ENCOURAGE IT

AS FAR AS EUTHANASIA GOES YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING IF YOU'RE DEAD AS LONG AS YOU LIVE YOU STILL HAVE A PURPOSE TO DO SO EVEN IF YOU'RE SUFFERING AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DIE YOUR CONTINUED EXISTENCE MAY STILL MAKE SOMEONE HAPPY OR INSPIRE OTHERS YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE TO DIE IF YOU WISH IN FACT YOU HAVE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT THE TRUTH IS AS LONG AS YOU LIVE YOU WILL FEEL PAIN SORROW AND YOU WILL SUFFER HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO JOY IN LIFE AND SOMETIMES SUFFERING FOR THAT JOY IS WORTH IT

POORLY FORMATTED AS THAT WAS THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE
DEPENDS IS THIS A HYPOTHETICAL BECAUSE IF I GET TO MAKE A HYPOTHETICAL WORLD THEN IT'LL HAVE TO BE A PERFECT ONE AND THE PEOPLE IN THAT WORLD WOULD HAVE TO ASK WHAT ARE CHILDREN
REMOVED
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO DIE THAT IS UP TO GOD TO DECIDE AND IF YOU DIE WELL THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE A POOR CHOICE AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME EVERY LIVING THING IS PRECIOUS TO GOD EVEN IF IT IS STILL IN THE WOMB
THE ARTICLE PROVIDES NO SPECIFIC EXAMPLES AS TO WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET AT JUST AS IN WAR ETHICAL PRINCIPLES NEED TO BE IN PLACE AND BE USED AS A GUIDELINE THEN IT HINTS AT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE TO KEEP THE ECONOMY IN CHECK AND TO ENSURE A MORE FAIR MORAL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL ACTORS

WHAT SPECIFIC LAWS REGULATIONS NEED TO BE ENACTED TO ENSURE THAT THE FREE MARKET AND WALL STREET ACT ETHICALLY
WALL STREET DOES HAVE ETHICS YOU DON'T SEE TRADERS SHORTING STOCKS THEN KILLING CEES TO REAP MILLIONS
I RECENTLY STARTED WORKING AT A MAJOR INVESTMENT BANK AND IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE THE INSIDE PERSPECTIVE OF ECONOMIC ETHICS WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THAT IT'S HARD TO PERCEIVE THE IMPACT SMALL DECISIONS CAN MAKE ON THE BROADER ECONOMY WHILE THERE ARE DEFINITELY EXCEPTIONS MOST OF THESE UNETHICAL DECISIONS ARE MADE WITHIN A CONTEXT OF PROBLEM SOLVING HIGH SPEED TRADING FOR INSTANCE ISN'T UTILIZED TO PUT RETAIL INVESTORS AT A DISADVANTAGE IT'S SIMPLY A BETTER TOOL

AT LEAST AT MY FIRM A LOT OF EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WE GO THROUGH A LOT OF TRAINING THAT TELLS US TO STEP BACK AND CONSIDER THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND IF THESE SMALL CHOICES WE'RE MAKING ARE MOVING THE BEHEMOTH OF INSTITUTION TOWARD A BETTER OR WORSE POSITION
WE GENERALLY AGREE THAT LAWS ARE BETTER THAN RELYING ON GOOD BEHAVIOR THE LAWS GOVERNING WALL STREET AND MARKETS IN GENERAL REFLECT THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE CAN AGREE ON A SET OF ETHICS FOR ENGAGING IN TRANSACTIONS
THE PREMISE HERE IS INCORRECT THE CONCEPT OF WAR ITSELF IS GROSSLY INETHICAL
THE GENEVA CONVENTION IS A FARCE MAKING RULES FOR VIOLENCE AND DEATH IS ABSURD
THE PREMISE OF THIS ARTICLE IS ABSURD THE ETHICS OF WAR ARE A BUNCH OF RULES THAT EVERYONE IGNORES JUST LIKE RULES AND REGULATIONS IN WALL STREET APPLYING MORE RULES AND ETHICS TO WALL STREET WILL JUST GIVE THEM MORE STUFF TO DISREGARD

THE NY TIMES ARE JUST A BUNCH OF WALL STREET APOLOGISTS WHO ARE SO INTELLECTUALLY STERILE AND THEIR WORLD-VIEW SO INSULATED BY IDEOLOGICAL BIAS THAT THEY COULD NEVER ENVISION ANY POSSIBILITIES BEYOND WALL STREET AND THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS IT THEY COULD ONLY ENVISION REFORMING EXISTING SYSTEMS AND CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE ANYTHING BEYOND THEM EVEN IF EXTERNALITIES THREATEN TO RENDER THOSE SYSTEMS OBSOLETE
IT WOULD TAKE HOURS IF NOT DAYS TO DISENTANGLE ALL OF THE PRECEPTS OR AXIOMS OFFERED UP BY THIS OPINION PIECE I DO THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER OR NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE PRINCIPLES IN QUESTION FOR EXAMPLE THE TERM COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IS TOSSED OUT AND IS USED IN THIS PIECE TO DESCRIBE WAR MARKETS AS A KIND OF ZERO SUM TERMINOLOGY WHERE ONE SIDE ENJOYS THE ADVANTAGE AND THE OTHER IS LEFT WITH SOMETHING LESS PER THE PIECE

THE PURSUIT OF A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE MARKET HAS COME TO JUSTIFY NEARLY ANY BEHAVIOR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES

IN WAR IMMORAL ACTION MAY PROVIDE THE COMBATANT WITH A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE BUT IT ALSO STAINS SOCIETY AND HUMANITY IN WAYS THAT WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY DEEMED TO BE UNACCEPTABLE

FOR AN ECONOMIST COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IS A CONCEPT THAT SHOWS EMPIRICALLY WHEN TWO PARTIES SPECIALIZE IN LABOR THE MARKET IN WHICH THESE PARTIES PARTICIPATE IS REWARDED WITH GREATER PROSPERITY BECAUSE BOTH ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN THEY WOULD BE IF EACH WERE TO TRY TO BE PRODUCTIVE IN MULTIPLE PURSUITS

HE'S RIGHT TO IDENTIFY THE MARKET AS A FUNDAMENTALLY AMORAL PLACE IN MUCH THE SAME WAY PHYSICS IS AMORAL OR ANY OTHER NATURALISTIC LAW HOWEVER ECONOMISTS AREN'T TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE ETHICAL MOTIVES OF BUSINESSES OR KNOW WHAT'S IN SOMEONE'S HEART WHEN THEY DECIDE TO COMMIT FRAUD MANY OF THESE COMMENTS ARE NOT UNLIKE CRITIQUES OFFERED BY MARX
I THINK THIS WRITER NEEDS TO GET HIS HEAD OUT OF THE GUTTER AND BETTER UNDERSTAND FINANCE AND THE BANKING SYSTEM THAN JUST QUOTE RANDOM MILITARY THEORISTS

MOST HEADLINES ARE PRE ISSUES LIKE DB BANKS HAVE BEEN PRETTY ALMOST VERY PASSIVE SINCE THEN THE PRESSURE FROM THE BOD IS USUALLY A BIGGER STEM OF MOST FORTUNE DILEMMAS AND ETHICS
I'M ALL FOR WALL STREET ALIGNING ITSELF WITH ADAM VIEW OF CAPITALISM JUST SO LONG THEY READ THE OTHER FOUR BOOKS OF WEALTH OF NATIONS ALONG WITH THEORY SENTIMENT
I LIKE THE IDEA BEHIND THE ARTICLE I REALLY DO BUT THERE'S A HUGE ISSUE THAT REMAINS POWER

AS ONE INCREASES THE WEALTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL INCLUDING A CORPORATION TO GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY ONE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THAT MONEY IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A VOTE EVERY DOLLAR SPENT EVERY PENNY COUNTED EACH ONE REPRESENTS SOME SORT OF WORK PERFORMED AND GIVEN AN APPROPRIATE WAGE OR CUT OF THE PIE THAT MEANS THOSE WITH MORE DOLLAR VOTES CAN PUSH LAWS RUN COMPETITION OUT OF BUSINESS AND GENERALLY MAINTAIN OR INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THESE VOTES

ON A CURSORY INSPECTION THIS SEEMS IMMORAL THE POOR ARE FORCED INTO JOBS AND THOSE WHO HAVE MORE WEALTH EXERT THEIR MONEY VOTE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER THOSE BELOW THEM BUT IF ONE DIGS A LITTLE DEEPER IS THIS POWER IMMORAL POWER HAS BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE FOR HUMANITY FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THOUGH I DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE HERE I THINK ONE CAN GENERALLY CONCLUDE THAT THE EARLIEST FORMATION OF CIVILIZATION REQUIRED POWER OF SOME SORT TO EXIST BE IT A KING RICH MERCHANTS OR A RELIGIOUS GROUP

IF ONE THINKS OF THESE VOTES AS POWER THERE IS NOTHING INHERENTLY WRONG A GOVERNMENT FOR EXAMPLE CAN USE GUNS TO RETAIN POWER WOULD WE CALL THAT IMMORAL OR EVEN AMORAL SOME RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OFFER REINCARNATION OR AFTERLIFE IS THAT IMMORAL OR AMORAL CAPITALISM PROMOTES A LOPSIDED POWER TO BE SURE BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT MAKES IT MORALLY WRONG

NOW ONE COULD ARGUE THAT FOR INSTANCE HUMAN LIFE IS VALUABLE AND EITHER THROUGH CORRUPTION OR MERE CHANCE PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE OF THESE MISAPPROPRIATIONS OF MONEY VOTES THAT IS A GOOD ARGUMENT AGAINST IMMORAL AND EVEN AMORAL BEHAVIOR IN THE MARKETPLACE BUT PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY OF NATURAL CAUSES AS WELL SHOULD ONE SUE OR DISMANTLE MOTHER NATURE I HAVEN'T BEEN LED TO ANY CONCLUSION THAT CAPITALISM DOESN'T PLAY OUT ANY DIFFERENTLY BARRING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS WHICH DO OR AT LEAST OUGHT TO PREVENT THIS SORT OF KILL OR BE KILLED MENTALITY THAT MIGHT ARISE POWER EXISTS IT WILL ALWAYS EXIST AND I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOWS IT IS INHERENTLY IMMORAL OR AMORAL
THIS SITE LOVES TO RAIL ON WALL STREET AS SOME ABSTRACT CONCEPT OF INTENTIONALLY EVIL BEHAVIOR IT'S AWESOME HOW NAIVE YOU ALL COME OFFICIAL CLEARLY HAVE NEVER WORKED IN FINANCIAL SERVICES OR KNOWN ANYONE WHO DOES WALL STREET HAS ETHICS YOU JUST THINK PROFIT IS EVIL POOR INCENTIVES ARE THE REAL ENEMY
THE AUTHOR ERRONEOUSLY ASSERTS THAT CAPITALISM HAS NO ETHICAL AND JUST BASIS MARKET EXCHANGES ARE MORAL IN THAT ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE ACTING OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND ARE MADE BETTER OFF BY THE EXCHANGE RESOURCE ALLOCATION IS JUST IN THAT PROPERTY OWNERS ARE PAID FOR THE USE OF THEIR PROPERTY
NOT REALLY

I MEAN WARS ARE PUBLIC AND EVERYONE CAN SEE AND ROOT AGAINST YOU IF YOU DO SOMETHING UNETHICAL YOU CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR BANKS AND TRADING BUSINESS SINCE THEY ARE PRIVATE AND DOES ITS WORK UNDER THE TABLE
WE CAN BUT TOO MANY DON'T WALL STREET CAN'T BECAUSE WALL STREET ISN'T A PERSON IT'S MADE UP OF PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO CAN HAVE ETHICS BUT


ETHICS NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT TAUGHT BY PARENTS FIRST AND FOREMOST IF NOT AT HOME AS IS OFTEN THE CASE THEN AT SCHOOL AT INTERVALS OR TO A VARYING DEGREE EVERY YEAR IT MUST BECOME A PART OF WHAT WE LEARN SO THAT IT BECOMES PART OF US WITHOUT QUESTION IN THE FUTURE IT CANNOT CHANGE OTHERWISE PEOPLE JUST SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE ETHICS ARE JUST TALKING TO THEMSELVES IT NEEDS TO HAVE EXAMPLES TO BE FOLLOWED EVERYTHING IN SOCIETY FOLLOWS THAT RULE WRONG OR NON EXISTENT EXAMPLES ARE A CANCER THAT SPREADS THROUGHOUT THE POPULATION THROUGH OUR INFALLIBLE NATURE IT'S OUR SHORT COMING THAT WE WILLFULLY IGNORE IT COULD TAKE 2 OR GENERATIONS OF BEING TAUGHT YEAR AFTER YEAR BUT IT'S POSSIBLE AT LEAST I THINK IT IS
WAR HAS ETHICS WAIT WHAT
THE TROUBLE IS THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY GLOBAL INTRANATIONAL COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS ARE AS JUST AS MUCH A WAR AS A CONVENTIONAL WAR IT IS AN EXTENSION OF THE NEVER ENDING GEOPOLITICAL STRUGGLE IT'S EASY TO SEE WAR CRIMES IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE FINANCIAL CRIMES YOU CAN'T SEE THE NATION STATE MANIPULATE IT'S OWN CURRENCY ARTIFICIALLY TO ADVANTAGE YOU CAN'T MONITOR THE FINANCIAL CRIMES OF OTHER COUNTRIES COMMITTED BY PRIVATE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHEN THOSE SAME COUNTRIES REFUSE TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE BEING BOUND BY THEIR OWN SELF INTEREST IF THERE'S NO RELIABLE ACCOUNTABILITY THERE CAN BE NOW RELIABLE REGULATIONS BECAUSE UNTIL SUCH TIME WE CAN VERIFY ACROSS THE BOARD COMPLIANCE ANY NEW INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REGULATIONS WILL BE ABUSED BY THE DISHONEST AND USED AGAINST THE HONEST AND THAT IS THE SWAN SONG OF THE MODERN GLOBALIZED FINANCIAL SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT
WAR HAS ETHICS JUST WHEN YOU DON'T NEED TO CROSS IT'S BOUNDS

THE SAME EVERYWHERE ELSE I GUESS
WAR DOESN'T HAVE ETHICS WE JUST LIKE TO PRETEND IT DOES THERE IS NOTHING ETHICAL ABOUT BOMBING A FAMILY BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE SAME HOUSE AS A SUSPECT CELL PHONE
READ THE STORY OF EDGEWOOD TECHNOLOGY SERVICES OR HOW I LOST MILLION DISCOVERING WHO MAKES MONEY MAKING SURE THE SOLARI POPSICLE INDEX DOES NOT GO UP BY CATHERINE AUSTIN FITTS

SOURCE
I AGREE THAT WALL STREET SHOULD BE MORE ETHICALLY INCLINED I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR POINT WAR DEALS WITH DEATH AND IS NEAR UNDENIABLY AN NECESSARY EVIL SO REGULATION IS EVERY DAY LIFE AND DEATH POOR ETHICAL GUIDELINES IN BANKING CAN POSSIBLY RESULT IN DEATH BUT MORE OFTEN A LOST JOB OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE WHICH IS NO DOUBT SERIOUS BUT IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO A VIETNAMESE FISHING VILLAGE BEING BLASTED WITH NAPALM
YOU CAN START BY ACTUALLY JAILING THE PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE LAW PASS LAWS THAT HOLD EXECUTIVES CRIMINALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTIONS OF THEIR COMPANIES THAT ARE ABLE TO BE SHOWN AS SYSTEMATIC AND INTENTIONAL
BUT BUT IN ALMOST EVERY DOCUMENTED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF LEGAL ETHICS IN WAR THEY HAVE BEEN BROKEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN BY BOTH OR ONE SIDE
THE ONLY THING ETHICAL ABOUT WAR IS WHAT'S WRITTEN DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS WELL AFTER ALL THE UNETHICAL BITS ARE DONE

THAT'S NO WAY TO RUN AN ECONOMY
WAR CAN HAVE ETHICS BUT HOW OFTEN ARE THESE ETHICAL NORMS ACTUALLY RESPECTED HOW MANY OVER THESE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY AGREED UPON
GREAT COLUMN I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE AN EXTENSION OF MY OWN
THERE IS NO GREATER GOOD THERE ARE DECISIONS AND THERE ARE RIGHT AND WRONG CHOICES TO MAKE IN THOSE DECISIONS THE RIGHT DECISION WILL ALWAYS LEAVE THOSE INVOLVED MORE MORAL

HUMANS STILL WILL COME TO EACH OTHERS BOUNDARIES IT IS THE DECISION WE MAKE WHEN WE MEET THAT HUMAN WHERE OUR MORALITY IS DETERMINED THIS DOES NOT CHANGE WHEN THE EXCHANGE MEDIUM OF MONEY IS ADDED TO THE MEETING TRADE IS STILL A MEETING BETWEEN HUMANS AND MORALS AND CIVILITY APPLY HERE JUST AS THEY WOULD IN ANY MEETING BETWEEN PEOPLE
I LOVE THE FANTASY THAT WAR HAS ETHICS AND RULES THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW RULES IN WAR ARE ALWAYS THE PEOPLE THAT LOSE THEM WARS ARE SAVAGE AND EVIL AFFAIRS INTENDED ON KILLING THOSE NOT LIKE YOU TO INSURE THAT THEY NEVER COME TO CHALLENGE YOU AGAIN

THEY ARE NOT SPORT OUTINGS IN WHICH INJURIES OCCUR AND EVERYONE STOPS FOR LUNCH


ON PAPER WAR IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SOME ETHICS AS WELL AS WALL STREET IN PRACTICE THOUGH AS WE ALL KNOW WAR HAS NO ETHICS AND NEITHER DOES WALL STREET WHERE IS THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WAR HAS ETHICS JUST BECAUSE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF WAR CRIMES AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALSO BEEN CONVICTED OF FINANCIAL CRIMES YET THE VAST MAJORITY OF ALL CRIME GOES UNPUNISHED BY THE CORRUPT LEGAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IN THE END IT'S NOT ABOUT SERVING JUSTICE IT'S ABOUT SERVING POWER AND THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO WAKE UP TO UNLESS WE WANT TO CREATE A LIVING HELL
JUST AS WAR THERE WILL BE SOME THAT WILL GO AROUND THE RULES

IN WALL STREET THERE IS A SAYING THAT GOES ALONG THE LINES OF

WHATEVER RULE YOU PUT WE'LL FIND A WAY TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF IT
THE CENTRAL PROBLEM IS THE WS HAS SUBJUGATED ALL LEVELS OF THE US GOVERNMENT AND HAS BEEN ITS MASTER FOR SEVERAL DECADES YOU CANNOT EXPECT AN INDUSTRY TO HAVE SOME CORE ETHIC IF THEY CONTROL THE MEANS OF REGULATION
WAR WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR
THIS ASSUMES SO MUCH WRONG STUFF IN REALITY WAR HAS ACTUALLY NO RULES AND THE MORE THE LAWS YOU IMPOSE TO INVESTORS THE MORE MONOPOLIES GROW AND THE MORE THEY ARE POWERFUL AND ABLE TO CONTROL THE LAWS IN ORDER TO REMOVE COMPETITION FROM THE MARKET
THIS ASSUMES WAR HAS ETHICS WHICH IT DOES NOT YOU HEAR ABOUT THE TERRIBLE THINGS THE LOSING SIDE DID DURING THE WAR YOU NEVER HEAR ABOUT THE TERRIBLE THINGS THE OTHER SIDE DID TO WIN OF COURSE WALL STREET ISNT OUT TO KILL PEOPLE AT LEAST NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE ANYWAY
REMOVED
REMOVED
I THINK THAT AFTER WE CAN SAY THAT THESE PPL SHOWED THEIR VALUE IN HUMAN SOCIETY AKA INSIDE JOB MOVIE
STOPPED READING AFTER THIS SENTENCE IMAGINE THE MORAL AND SOCIETAL HAZARD IF THE MILITARY PERMITTED SUCH RETALIATION AGAINST THOSE WHO REPORTED ILLEGAL AND IMMORAL BEHAVIORS
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING STATED BEFORE THAT SENTENCE

THEY DO PERMIT IT
CORPORATIONS ARE NOT PEOPLE LET'S FIX THAT LET'S ALSO WORK ON CHANGING THE NOTION THAT A ONLY PURPOSE IS TO GENERATE PROFIT STRICTLY FOR SHARE HOLDERS
IN A JUST ECONOMY VENTURE CAPITALISTS WOULD

NOT EXIST THIS IS JUST MORE TIRED LIBERAL PAP THAT SEEKS TO JUSTIFY CAPITALISM I FIND IT HILARIOUS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS TO REACH ALL THE WAY TO FUCKING WAR TO EXPLAIN WHY AN ETHICAL CAPITALISM IS SOMEHOW POSSIBLE UTTER GARBAGE
ADVOCATES HOLD FAST TO JUSTIFICATIONS THAT AMOUNT TO VARIATIONS ON THE INVISIBLE HAND THEORY OF ADAM SMITH THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT A MORAL SPACE BUT ONE THAT RELIES ON A FREE AND FAIR MARKET

ADAM SMITH SPELLS OUT MARKET DISTORTION IN WEALTH OF NATIONS ADDRESSING THIS AUTHORS MISCONCEPTION OF THE INVISIBLE HAND THE INVISIBLE HAND ALWAYS ACTS IN SPITE OF HOW DISTORTED THE MARKET BECOMES

HE THEN GOES ON TO CONCLUDE

IN SHORT THE AMORAL ECONOMY ENVISIONED BY FREE MARKET THEORY IS A FANTASY

NO SIR YOU HAVE MISSED THE POINT ENTIRELY PERHAPS MARKET DISTORTIONS ARE THE CAUSE OF THIS APPARENT ABHORRENT BEHAVIOR BUT HOW COULD THAT BE

AN AGENT THAT BREAKS A REGULATION IS ALSO AN AGENT WHO BREAKS A LAW REGULATIONS ARE THE CAUSE OF MARKET DISTORTIONS FOR THEIR TENDENCY TO ENCOURAGE A TYPE OF BEHAVIOR DEEMED IN THE PUBLIC BEST INTEREST HOME OWNERSHIP MARRIAGE REDUCE INCREASE THE POPULATION REDUCE DISCRIMINATION ETC THAT PEOPLE WOULD OTHERWISE NOT PARTICIPATE IN DISTORTIONS HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE CONDEMNING A FREE MARKET BECAUSE IT GIVES PEOPLE THE FREEDOM TO BREAK LAWS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE I AM SURE THERE ARE LAWS AGAINST FRAUD THE MISREPRESENTATION OF CLAIMS THE ILLICIT AND IMPERMISSIBLE USE OF OTHER PEOPLES MONEY LAST I HEARD THIS WAS ILLEGAL

THE AUTHOR THEN GOES ON TO ASKING WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT I DON'T THINK WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM YET SO WHY ARE WE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS HERE

THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES

WE NEED BETTER LAWS AND REGULATIONS BUT FIRST WE MUST ESTABLISH A FOUNDATIONAL MORALITY TO GUIDE THEIR DEVELOPMENT

AND THE CYCLE REPEATS THE ADVOCACY OF MORE COMMAND ECONOMY IF ONLY THE REGULATIONS WERE JUST BETTER WHAT PRINCIPLES ARE WE MISSING OUT HERE
IF ONLY THIS WERE THE CASE THEN WHY HASN'T A SOLUTION BEEN FOUND BY NOW AFTER HOW MANY DECADES OF BETTER AND BETTER REGULATIONS
WHO IS GOING TO BE THE ONE TO ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATIONAL MORALITY FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO FOLLOW A LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN A QUORUM OF THE MOST INTELLIGENT ECONOMISTS


BUT WAR IS DEATH UPFRONT WALL STREET CORRUPTION SEEMS LIKE A VICTIMLESS CRIME TO THOSE WHO COMMIT IT THAT'S WHY OUR GOVERNMENT IS FUCKED GREED PEOPLE AREN'T TRYING TO WRECK SOCIETY THEY JUST WANT A FEW MORE BUCKS FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES GREED NEEDS TO BE KEPT IN CHECK WE NEED A TAX ON WALL STREET SPECULATION
BUT CAN YOU HAVE ETHICS WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT SOME HAVING LESS THAN OTHER DESPITE WORKING HARDER
WALL STREET NEEDS EXPROPRIATION NOT ETHICS
BANKERS CREATE WAR FOR PROFIT SLAUGHTER AND SUFFERING ARE OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO BANKERS
THESE ETHICS SOUND VERY EXPENSIVE HOW DO THEY HELP INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE AFTER ALL WE ALL KNOW THAT PROFITS AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE ARE FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN LIVING IN A SOCIETY WITH LIVABLE WAGES A ROBUST MIDDLE CLASS OR TRUST BETWEEN CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES
IF YOU'VE EVER READ CLAUSEWITZ YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONLY ETHIC IN WAR IS VICTORY AND ANY ACTION THAT CAN BE TAKEN WHICH WILL LEAD TO THIS VICTORY IS THE IMPERATIVE OF THE GOOD COMMANDER TO ORDER AND CARRY OUT THIS VARIANT OF WAR PHILOSOPHY IS THE BACKBONE OF ALL MODERN MILITARY DOCTRINE
TRYING TO MAKE CAPITALISM COMPATIBLE WITH ETHICS GOOD ONE
NEARLY A DECADE AFTER ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING FINANCIAL COLLAPSES IN MODERN HISTORY WALL STREET APPEARS AS CORRUPT AS EVER

IMPLYING THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T CAUSE THE FINANCIAL COLLAPSE
UNLIKE WAR GOVERNMENTS CAN TAX FIRMS ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE SO THAT EXTERNALITIES AKA ETHICS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE BUSINESS PROFIT DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IT IS UNETHICAL TO CHANGE THE CLIMATE OF THE PLANET CARBON TAX IT IS UNETHICAL TO PAY POVERTY WAGES MINIMUM WAGE ETC
WALL STREET DOES HAVE ETHICS MANY PEOPLE ON WALL STREET ARE CHARTERED FINANCIAL ANALYSTS TO GET AND MAINTAIN THIS DESIGNATION YOU NEED TO COMPLY WITH A STRICT STANDARD OF ETHICS
BUT WAR CAN'T
PEOPLE WHO DON'T OBEY THE RULES OF WAR ARE LINED UP AND SHOT
IMPLYING WAR HAS ETHICS
SOME GREAT THOUGHTS IN HIS ARTICLE KUDOS TO THE TIMES
THEY DO THEY'RE JUST SHITTY ONES
THE SECOND WAR HAS ETHICS WALL STREET WILL ALSO

THE SECOND BEFORE COMING TO THE CONCLUSION OF WAR HAVING ETHICS CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING OXYMORON CIVILIZED WAR

WAR IS NOT ETHICAL WALL STREET IS CORRUPT TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONCEPTS
MONEY CORRUPTS THE HUMAN MIND THROUGH SUBTLE MIND ALTERING DEVICES IN THE BILLS
I DONT LIKE THE COMPARISON AT ALL SORRY GUYS WAR IS ITS OWN ENTITY NOTHING CAN NOR SHOULD BE COMPARED TO WAR IN THIS MANNER WHILE AT WAR EVERY SINGLE HUMAN RULE AND LAW IS SET ASIDE FOR THE REASON OF PURE VICTORY ALL ETHICS DERIVED FROM WAR ARE POST WAR IDEALS WAR CRIMES ARE TIRED AND OBSERVED AFTER WAR ALL REGRETS AND CONCLUSIONS DRAWN ARE AFTER THE ACT AS TAKEN PLACE IN THE MOMENTS OF WAR IT IS PURE INSTINCT AND REACTION PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE MURDER TORTURE AND THINGS OF THIS ILK TO A FEW PEOPLE HANDLING A LOT OF MONEY
IN WAR THOSE WITH SO CALLED ETHICS ALWAYS LOSE

IT'S AN HISTORICAL REALITY YOU CAN HAVE MERCY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN SOMEONE SUBMITS BUT ONLY AFTER YOU TOTALLY DEVASTATE BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY

WHICH IS WHY I FEEL THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NUKED MECCA SEPT

THERE IS TALK OF WAR AND THEN THERE IS THE BATTLEFIELD DO NOT CONFUSE THE TWO

FROM SUN TAU TO GENITIVE WASHINGTON TO NAPOLEON TO TRUMAN TO AND SUICIDE AND HOMICIDE BOMBINGS IT'S NO ROMANTIC BULLSHIT

THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE IS WILLFULLY OMITTING THE BRUTALITY OF WARFARE IN THIS COMPARISON IF NOT HE IS AN INTELLIGENT IDIOT
WALL STREET CANNOT HAVE ETHICS FOR FINANCE AND MARKET ARE INHERENTLY UNETHICAL

LIKE THE PEOPLE MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE SAY IF CAPITALISM IS ABOUT MAXIMISING PROFITS FOR OWNERS AND SHAREHOLDERS THEN MORAL STIPULATIONS WOULD HINDER THE ABILITY OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO DO THAT

WHY STRUCTURE OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM AS WE DO ONLY TO HINDER IT WITH MORAL STIPULATIONS THIS IS HALF ASHING THINGS IF WE ARE STAYING WITH CAPITALISM I VOTE TO MAKE THINGS AS EXPLOITATIVE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN OUR SYSTEM REALLY SHINES THAT IS WHEN CAPITAL IS AT IT'S PEAK

WHY HALF ASS OUR EXPLOITATION OF OURSELVES THINGS ARE TURNING OUT EXACTLY AS YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FROM A SYSTEM THAT TURNS PEOPLE INTO COLD FINANCIAL CALCULATORS AND LEFT BRAINED PSYCHOS

IF PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY WHY WOULD YOU TRY TO LIMIT THE NATURAL PROGRESSION OF CAPITALISM WITH MORAL STIPULATIONS WE MIGHT AS WELL COMPLETELY REORGANIZE OUR SOCIETY BECAUSE EVENTUALLY AS IS THE SLIMY NATURE OF CAPITALISM THE SYSTEM WILL SLIP OUT OF THE MORAL YOKE AND CONTINUE ON AS IT IS NOW PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM IN YEARS AS CAPITALISM ONCE AGAIN BECOMES MORE AND MORE EXPLOITATIVE

CAPITALISM IS INHERENTLY IMMORAL SO NO AMOUNT OF REGULATION COULD EVER MAKE IT OTHERWISE
THAT'S NONSENSE

WE DON'T HAVE ETHICS AND NEITHER DOES WAR OR RATHER YES WE HAVE ETHICS AND THEN SOMEONE OFFERS US MILLION TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY FOR SOMETHING UNETHICAL AND WE DO AND THEN WE NO LONGER HAVE ETHICS OR MAYBE A LITTLE ETHICS

HELL WAR IN ITSELF IS AN ACTIVITY WHERE ITS PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO MAKE PEOPLE RICHARD

WAR IS A RACKET IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN IT IS POSSIBLY THE OLDEST EASILY THE MOST PROFITABLE SURELY THE MOST VICIOUS IT IS THE ONLY ONE INTERNATIONAL IN SCOPE IT IS THE ONLY ONE IN WHICH THE PROFITS ARE RECKONED IN DOLLARS AND THE LOSSES IN LIVES A RACKET IS BEST DESCRIBED I BELIEVE AS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS TO THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ONLY A SMALL INSIDE GROUP KNOWS WHAT IT IS ABOUT IT IS CONDUCTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VERY FEW AT THE EXPENSE OF THE VERY MANY OUT OF WAR A FEW PEOPLE MAKE HUGE FORTUNES UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS MAJOR GENERAL AND TWO TIME MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT SMEDLEY D BUTLER

WALL STREET ISN'T UNETHICAL BECAUSE THEY LACK ETHICS THEY'RE UNETHICAL BECAUSE THEY MAKE BRUTAL QUANTITIES OF MONEY OFF OTHER PEOPLE'S MISERY AND THEY CAN TELL THEMSELVES THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY THE ONES DOING IT IT'S THE COMPANY IT'S THE COMPANY'S FAULT NOT THEIR PERSONAL FAULT EVEN THOUGH THEY MADE ALL THE DECISIONS

THE PROBLEMS IN SOCIETY ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY DOWN TO THE FACT THAT WE RUN IT ON A AND FROM THERE FOLLOWS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE MOST MONEY ARE THE MOST FREE SO PEOPLE DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE MONEY ETHICAL OR NOT

OUR SOCIETY IS IN ITSELF CORRUPT AND IT ALSO VERY POWERFULLY CORRUPTS WHEN YOU HAVE A FOUNDATION AS TOXIC TO SOCIETY AS COMPETITION THEN OF COURSE IT WON'T BE A GOOD ONE
SO ARE THEY ADVOCATING FOR MORE REGULATIONS I MEAN WE HAVE LAWS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO REGULATE WAR BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ARMIES DON'T BREAK THEM

I'M A FREE MARKET ADVOCATE BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST AS CONCERNED ABOUT CORRUPTION IN POWERFUL MEMBERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS THEY ARE IN THE PUBLIC AND IT'S JUSTIFIED WITH THAT SAID I STILL THINK REGULATIONS ARE IMMORAL

THE ARTICLE SEEMS TO IMPLY THE NEED FOR A STRICTLY REGULATED PRIVATE SECTOR TO SOME DEGREE BUT THE FACT THEY ARE PROVIDING CORPORATIONS THAT BROKE LAWS SEEMS KIND OF IRRELEVANT THE GOVERNMENT BREAKS LAWS ARMIES BREAK LAWS WHY ARE COMPANIES NOW MORE IMMORAL

THE MOST INTERESTING CLAIM BY DAVID DEUTSCH I FOUND IN THE MATERIAL WAS THAT COMPUTATION WAS A FUNDAMENTAL FEATURE LIKE QUANTUM MECHANICS AS OPPOSED TO BEING SOMETHING EMERGENT LIKE BRIDGE BUILDING HOWEVER THE JUSTIFICATION SEEMS TO SIMPLY BE JUST ANY PHYSICAL PROCESS CAN BE SIMULATED BY A COMPUTER I PERSONALLY HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT THAT HOW DO YOU SIMULATE SEEMINGLY PURELY RANDOM PHENOMENA ALSO HOW DOES BEING ABLE TO SIMULATE SOMETHING IN A CERTAIN MANNER COMPUTATION MEAN THAT COMPUTATION IS FUNDAMENTAL PERHAPS I MISSED SOMETHING

OTHER GOOD BITS REMEMBERABLE FOR ME

AIA MUST HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PRODUCE NEW EXPLANATIONS AS OPPOSED TO MERE TRANSFORMATION OF INPUTS INTO OUTPUTS THOUGH IT DOES SEEM TO BE A TENUOUS DISTINCTION AS EXPLANATIONS THEMSELVES DO SEEM TO ME TO BE AN INSTANCE OF

THE PREVALENCE IMPORTANCE OF ERROR IN HUMAN KNOWLEDGE

PERHAPS ALL FEATURES OF THE HUMAN MIND THAT ARE NOT UNDERSTOOD ARE THE SAME SO SIMPLY SOLVING CREATIVITY WOULD SOLVE ALL OF THEM

WE NEED A KNOWLEDGE LEAP SIMILAR TO REALIZATION THAT THE SHAPE OF ANIMALS IS NOT WHAT DEFINES THEM BUT THAT TRAITS GENES CREATE SHAPES AS A
HUMANITY ONCE HAD VERY BASIC SKILLS COMMUNICATED PRIMITIVELY AND LIVED IN MUD HUTS SOME STILL DO HUMAN BRAINS HAVEN'T EVOLVED ALL THAT MUCH IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE REASON CIVILIZATION IS WHERE IT'S AT TODAY IS THROUGH AN ACCUMULATION OF POOLED KNOWLEDGE AI IS ONLY LIMITED BY ITS COMPUTATIONAL ABILITY AND THROUGH OUR EFFORTS IS CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AI HAS A BIG HEAD START ON HUMANITY IN TERMS OF EVOLUTION AND IT HAS INSTANT ACCESS TO OUR ACCUMULATED KNOWLEDGE BASE THE PRINCIPLE OF MODERN COMPUTING BEGUN YEARS AGO WITH TURING LOOK HOW FAR WE'VE COME IN THAT SPACE OF TIME ADAPTIVE ABILITY IN THE WORLD ENVIRONMENT AND BEYOND IS ONLY A FEW STEPS DOWN THE EVOLUTIONARY LINE THEY ARE THE NEXT STAGE OF EVOLUTION
THIS DOES NOT SEEM TERRIBLY DEEP OR INSIGHTFUL TO ME THE PROBLEM OF EVIL IS ONLY A PROBLEM IF GOD IS OMNIBENEVOLENT OMNISCIENT AND OMNIPOTENT IF YOU CHUCK OUT OMNIPOTENCE SO THAT GOD IS HELPLESS TO ERADICATE EVIL THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEM OF EVIL

THE SOTERIOLOGICAL ASPECT THAT THE AUTHOR SEEMS SO PLEASED WITH ALSO STRIKES ME AS NO LESS PROBLEMATIC THAN THE PUZZLE IT IS SUPPOSED TO REPLACE IT SEEMS EQUALLY UNFAIR THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL GO TO HELL JUST BECAUSE THEY HEARD OF JESUS WHILE OTHERS GET A DEFINITIVE POST-MORTEM ENCOUNTER WITH GOD BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HEARD OF JESUS EITHER WAY SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING CONDEMNED TO ETERNAL TORMENT DUE AT LEAST IN PART TO BAD LUCK

GOD IS OMNIPOTENT OMNIPRESENT THIS ARGUMENT SETS FORTH A PREMISE THAT GOD IS OUR CREATOR WHEN IN FACT IT SHOULD BE ARGUING ABOUT OUR TWO ARE SEPARATE
GOD IS THE UNIVERSE THE UNBOUND BEING THE WORD GOD BY DEFINITION MEANS EVERYTHING GOD ENCOMPASSES ALL GOOD AND EVIL FOR WITHOUT ONE THERE CANNOT EXIST THE OTHER IT IS THE GREAT COLLIDING OF THESE FORCES THAT ALLOWS THE PHYSICAL PLANE TO EXIST
OUR CREATOR IS PHYSICAL OUR CREATOR IS A MANIPULATOR OF DNA BACTERIA VIRUS AND THE NECESSARY PHYSICAL LAWS THAT PERTAIN TO THIS UNIVERSE LDS MEMBERS ARE TOLD FROM THE BEGINNING GOD IS PHYSICAL THEY AND MOST RELIGIONS HAVE CONFUSED THESE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
WE EXIST ON THIS PHYSICAL PLANE SCIENCE HAS ALL BUT PROVEN THAT THIS PLANE IS A DIGITAL PROJECTION OUR SOULS ARE ETERNAL LIGHT ELECTRICITY COUPLED WITH THIS PHYSICAL PLANE IT IS ALL THAT WE KNOW LOVE COUPLED WITH HATE PLEASURE WITH PAIN IT IS IN THIS WORLD THAT WE ACQUIRE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE THEN WE DIE THEN WE LIVE THEN WE DIE EVERY TIME GATHERING KNOWLEDGE EXPERIENCE TO ADD TO THE ETERNAL SOURCE CODE
THE PROBLEM OF EVIL IS ONLY A PROBLEM BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE JOSEPH SMITH SAY IT IS A PROBLEM IN FACT IT IS A SOLUTION TO ITSELF IT CAN NEVER OVERCOME THE GOOD THAT PUSHES AGAINST IT IT CAN NEVER OVERCOME OR BE TRIUMPHANT BECAUSE IT'S VERY NATURE IS TO CORRUPT AND DESTROY FROM THAT DESTRUCTION ALWAYS ARRISES NEW CREATION AND BALANCE
TO CUT SHORT FOR THE SAKE OF TIME TO KNOW THE TRUTH IS TO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND MEDITATE PRAY ON THE SOURCE TALK TO THE SOURCE ASK AND RECEIVE USE OUR BRAINS IN AN OPEN STATE OF BEING RELIGION CLOSES THAT STATE OF BEING AND MAKES US SURE THAT WE ALREADY KNOW THEREFORE HAMPERING ANY CHANCE FOR ETERNAL PROGRESSION LOGIC AND REASON ARE THE WAY TO THE SOURCE
INTERESTING I CONSIDER THE PROBLEM OF EVIL DEBATE AT PRETTY MUCH AT STALEMATE AS NOTHING THAT ANY RATIONAL PERSON CAN SAY WILL DEFEAT BLIND FAITH BUT DON'T STOP TRYING AT LEAST THE DEBATE GIVES ONE A CHANCE TO DO SOME MENTAL GYMNASTICS AND HONE ONE'S PHILOSOPHICAL SKILLS AT DEBATE ANYWAY MY APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF EVIL IS BY THINKING AND SIMPLY ASK THE QUESTION IF GOD CAN CREATE A HEAVEN THAT IS SO PERFECT THEN WHY BOTHER CREATING LIFE

I CAN SEE HOW IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT CERTAIN COMPLEX THOUGHTS COULD NOT BE COMMUNICATED EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT LANGUAGE OR AT LEAST THAT IT WOULD NOT BE FEASIBLE IN PRACTICE BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE CLAIM THAT WE CANNOT HAVE OR COMPREHEND COMPLEX THOUGHTS WITHOUT LANGUAGE IS UNTENABLE IF WE REQUIRE LANGUAGE FOR COMPLEX THOUGHTS THEN HOW DID WE DEVELOP LANGUAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE CERTAIN COMPLEX IDEAS HAVE TO BE FIRST UNDERSTOOD BEFORE ANY LANGUAGE CAN BE ACQUIRED FOR EXAMPLE CHILDREN KNOW WHAT CIRCLES ARE BEFORE THEY LEARN THE DEFINITION OR EVEN HOW TO SAY THE WORD WE MATCH WORDS TO IDEAS WE ALREADY HAVE IF WE DON'T HAVE AN IDEA OF THE CONCEPT IN OUR MIND THEN WHAT ARE WE MATCHING A WORD TO WHEN WE LEARN IT IN OTHER WORDS HOW CAN WE ATTACH SEMANTICS TO WORDS IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA OF THE CONCEPT BEFORE LEARNING A WORD IF A PERSON HAS LIVED IN A WORLD OF RECTANGLES AND SQUARES HIS WHOLE LIFE AND HAS NO IDEA WHAT A CIRCLE IS TEACHING HIM THE WORD CIRCLE DOESN'T MEAN HE UNDERSTANDS THE CONCEPT AT ALL OF COURSE WE CAN USE WORDS TO COMMUNICATE IDEAS TO BUILD AN IMAGE THAT SOMEONE HAS NEVER SEEN BUT WHEN DOING SO WE ARE USING WORDS ATTACHED TO CONCEPTS THAT OTHERS DO UNDERSTAND AS IN THE MAN CLIMBING UP A ROPE WITH A PLASTIC DUSTBIN OVER HIS HEAD EXAMPLE GIVEN IN THE ARTICLE

ALSO I KNOW THAT MANY MATHEMATICIANS AND LOGICIANS SEE CERTAIN PATTERNS AND ABSTRACTIONS IN THEIR HEAD BEFORE THEY ARE ABLE TO ARTICULATE IT I KNOW THAT WHEN I AM THINKING ABOUT CERTAIN PROBLEMS I AM VISUALIZING IT GEOMETRICALLY AND USE LITTLE OR NO LANGUAGE AT ALL IN THE PROCESS IN FACT EVEN IF I CAN STATE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS IN SOME LANGUAGE FORMAL OR NATURAL I DON'T FEEL THAT I TRULY UNDERSTAND IT UNTIL I HAVE A NON VERBAL VISUALIZATION OR PICTURE OF IT IN MY HEAD AFTER I HAVE SOME EPIPHANY OR BREAKTHROUGH I THEN HAVE TO CONVERT IT TO A LANGUAGE TO COMMUNICATE IT TO OTHERS BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT AN AUTOMATIC OR FLUID PROCESS I KNOW THAT I AM NOT UNIQUE IN THAT REGARD AND I THINK THAT IS LIKELY THE MORE COMMON PROCESS WHEN LEARNING AND THINKING ABOUT CERTAIN ABSTRACT FIELDS SUCH AS MATHEMATICS
DENNET IS BEING A BIT SLOPPY IN HIS DISCUSSION OF INTELLIGENCE

IN THE BEGINNING THERE WAS DARWINIAN EVOLUTION OF SPECIES BY NATURAL SELECTION A VARIETY OF CANDIDATE ORGANISMS WERE BLINDLY GENERATED BY MORE OR LESS ARBITRARY PROCESSES OF RECOMBINATION AND MUTATION OF GENES THESE ORGANISMS WERE FIELD TESTED AND ONLY THE BEST DESIGNS SURVIVED THIS IS THE GROUND FLOOR OF THE TOWER LET US CALL ITS INHABITANTS DARWINIAN CREATURES

EVOLUTION IS A LOT MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT IT DOESN'T JUST PICK GOOD DESIGNS IT PICKS DESIGNS THAT ARE THEMSELVES GOOD AT EVOLVING FOR INSTANCE BY SETTING THE RATE OF MUTATIONS OR BY DISCOVERING GOOD BUILDING BLOCKS IN THAT SENSE IT IS ALREADY THE CASE THAT EVOLUTION HAS SOME LEVEL OF PRESELECTION

BUT HOW IS THIS PRESELECTION IN POPPERIAN AGENTS TO BE DONE WHERE IS THE FEEDBACK TO COME FROM A BETTER SYSTEM INVOLVES PRESELECTION AMONG ALL THE POSSIBLE BEHAVIORS OR ACTIONS WEEDING OUT THE TRULY STUPID OPTIONS BEFORE RISKING THEM IN THE HARSH WORLD WE HUMAN BEINGS ARE CREATURES CAPABLE OF THIS THIRD REFINEMENT BUT WE ARE PROBABLY NOT ALONE

AS EXPLAINED ABOVE PRESELECTION IS NOT NECESSARILY ACHIEVED BY PLANNING ONE MAY CONSIDER SOME MEASURE OF SIMILARITY WITH PREVIOUS ACTIONS AND PREFERENTIALLY TRY OUT ACTIONS THAT DO NOT RESEMBLE TERRIBLE PREVIOUS ACTIONS DON'T TRY JUMPING INTO A 2 METERS DEEP HOLE IF JUMPING INTO A METER DEEP HOLE PROVED A BAD IDEA CONVERSELY PREFERENTIALLY TRY OUT ACTIONS THAT RESEMBLE THOSE THAT WERE SUCCESSFUL NOT ONLY ARE HUMANS NOT ALONE IN DOING THAT BUT IT'S LIKELY THAT NEARLY EVERYTHING SMARTER THAN AN INSECT CAN DO THAT CAN THEY PLAN IN THE SENSE OF PREDICTING THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHAINS OF CAUSES AND THEIR EFFECTS WHICH IS WHAT DENNETT HAS IN MIND HERE THAT'S MUCH MORE ADVANCED AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE AND A FEW OTHER SPECIES ARE ALONE CAPABLE OF THAT

APART FROM THESE MINOR TECHNICALITIES I AGREE WITH THE GIST OF THE ARTICLE LANGUAGE IS NOT THOUGHT BUT I THINK IT FAILS TO INSIST ENOUGH ON LANGUAGE AS A TOOL FOR ACTION VERSUS LANGUAGE AS A TOOL FOR REPRESENTATION
A REMINDER

OPINIONS ARE NOT VALUABLE HERE ARGUMENTS ARE COMMENTS THAT SOLELY EXPRESS MUSINGS OPINIONS BELIEFS OR ASSERTIONS WITHOUT ARGUMENT MAY BE REMOVED
IT'S AN INTERESTING TAKE ON ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS WHY DO ANYTHING AT ALL

IN ORDER TO WANT TRUTH GOOD HAPPINESS ETC WE HAVE TO START OFF BY WANTING SOMETHING THINGS LIKE SEX FOOD FRIENDS AND RANDOM STUFF ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE CAN IMMEDIATELY GRASP APPRECIATE AND ENJOY IN THE GREEK UNDERSTANDING THAT WHOLE NOTION OF WANTING THINGS IN GENERAL IS ITSELF A GOOD THING SINCE IT IMPLIES A STRONG INTRINSIC MOTIVATION AND WANTING NOTHING WOULDN'T BE SEEN AS INHERENTLY A VIRTUE BUT RATHER A PROBLEM LEADING TO APATHY INACTIVITY AND DESPAIR

LARGELY AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN STRAINS THOUGHT THOUGH ADMITTEDLY NOT ALL OF THEM ANGLO-AMERICAN CULTURE HAS AN UNDERCURRENT OF TREATING IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL PLEASURES ENTIRELY AS A DISTRACTION AND CORRUPTION OF INTERESTS AWAY FROM DIVINE TRUTHS HENCE THE STRONG TENDENCY TOWARDS PROHIBITION OF THINGS THAT ARE SEEN AS OVERLY CORRUPTING ALCOHOL DRUGS PROSTITUTION ETC OF COURSE SOME EXAMPLES OF CHRISTIAN THOUGHT IN OTHER PLACES ALSO REJECT THAT POSITION AND TAKES A MORE CLASSICAL APPROACH LIKE IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE BUT IN THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING WORLD THE STANCE OF REJECTING INTERMEDIATE PLEASURES STILL PREDOMINATES

ALSO DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THAT THE RUNGS OF THE LADDER AT THE END WERE ALL COCKS
REMOVED
HOW DOES THIS FIT IN WITH ARGUMENTS FROM THE PHAEDO IN PARTICULAR I REMEMBER THAT SOCRATES ARGUES A PHILOSOPHER'S GOAL IS TO BE CLOSE TO DEATH ABSTAINING FROM PHYSICAL STIMULI INCLUDING PHYSICAL PLEASURES SO AS TO GET CLOSER TO THE IDEALS IS THERE ANY CONTRADICTION IN THAT ARGUMENT AND THE ONE PRESENTED HERE IT SEEMS LIKE GIVING IN OR SEEKING A PHYSICAL PLEASURE MAY AT LEAST TEMPORARILY DRIVE YOU CLOSER TO BEING DISTRACTED BY THE PHYSICAL I HAVE NOT READ THE SYMPOSIUM OR KNOW HOW IT FITS IN THE LARGER SCHEME OF WRITINGS THOUGH
SOCRATES ASSERTS THAT THE BEGINNING OF RIGHTEOUSNESS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT OUR WORLD THINKS OF THE WORD MAY BE SEXUAL DESIRE IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EACH TIME YOU BANG SOME CHICK YOU MOVE UP A WRUNG IT MEANS THAT AT FIRST YOU NOTICE THAT SOMEONE HAS A GREAT BODY SUPERFICIALLY AT THE END AND WHAT IS MORALLY UNIVERSALLY WHATEVERLY BEST FOR SOCRATES IS THAT YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE THE GREAT BODY THAT MAY NOT EVEN BE THERE INSTEAD NOTICING THAT THE PERSON IS BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE OF THE TRAITS SOCRATES LISTS

SOMEONE ELSE HERE SAID THAT IT'S JUST A NATURAL PART OF GROWING UP THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT IT CAN ALSO BE ACHIEVED AT A VERY YOUNG AGE

THIS MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS IN FACT MOST OF WHAT SOCRATES PLATO ARISTOTLE WRITES IS QUITE LOGICALLY OBVIOUS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THEY WERE JUST THE ONES THAT WROTE IT DOWN COHERENTLY
THE CARTOON IS LITERALLY AND SUBSTANTIVELY MONOCHROMATIC ODD THAT THE REPRODUCTION OF THE BEAUTIFUL IS NOT EVEN MENTIONED NOT TO MENTION SOCRATES ENACTMENT THEREOF BY TELLING A STORY OF BEING TOLD A STORY

IT'S ONLY VALUE MIGHT BE TO PROVOKE ACTUALLY READING THE SYMPOSIUM

ISN'T THIS JUST AGE AND EXPERIENCE THOUGH AS TIME GOES ON YOU NOTICE THESE THINGS NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD AND CONTINUE TO HAVE SEX AS ONE GETS OLDER THE CHANCES OR FREQUENCY OF SEX RISES BUT I FEEL THAT'S LESS IMPACTFUL THAN AGE MATURITY AND EXPERIENCE IN FACT THOSE CHANCES OR FREQUENCIES RISE BECAUSE YOU GET OLDER AND REALIZE INITIAL PHYSICAL LUSTFUL BEAUTY IS LESS IMPORTANT I GUESS YOU COULD ARGUE IT BOTH WAYS IN THAT CASE BUT I FEEL AGE AND MATURITY WEIGHS MORE
IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE RIGHTEOUSNESS WHAT DOES RIGHTEOUSNESS ENTAIL IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHTEOUSNESS AS VIRTUE THEN ONE CAN CONCLUDE THAT SOCRATES WAS NOT ALL FOR SEXUAL DESIRE IN FACT HE BELIEVED THAT BODILY PLEASURES LIKE SEXUAL DESIRE INTERFERED WITH ATTAINING WISDOM AND VIRTUE WHICH SHOULD BE THE ULTIMATE GOALS FOR EVERY PHILOSOPHER YET IF WE SAY THAT SOCRATES VALUED SEXUAL DESIRES AS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS RIGHTEOUSNESS WOULD THAT NOT BE LIKE IMPLYING THAT SOCRATES DID NOT WORK TOWARDS BEING A PHILOSOPHER
I AGREE AND SOME PARTS DON'T AGREE ITS JUST SO SINGLED MINDED I GUESS IN A WAY OH YOU WANT TOO STEP TOWARDS RIGHTEOUSNESS WHAT IS RIGHTEOUSNESS BELIEVED IN SEXUAL DESIRE AND THEN YOU'LL BE ON THE STEP TO ME SOUNDS MORE LIKE UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATING YOUR SURROUNDINGS
I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST REASON ARISTOTLE DIDN'T LIKE SOCRATES ALL TOO MUCH AND WENT THE OTHER WAY ON A LOT OF THINGS
SO WHY SHOULD ACCOUNT BE AN ACCOUNT OF SOCRATES BELIEFS PLATO VERY WELL MIGHT BE FOLLOWING HIS OWN MOTIVES IN LITERATURE WHICH MAY NOT HAVE TO DO WITH THE HISTORICAL ACCURACY OF SOCRATES AS A MANUAL
SO FAR SOCRATES I HAVE DEALT WITH INTO WHICH EVEN YOU COULD PROBABLY BE INITIATED BUT WHETHER YOU COULD GRASP THE PERFECT REVELATION ENLIGHTENMENT TO WHICH THEY LEAD THE PILGRIM IF HE DOES NOT STRAY FROM THE RIGHT PATH I DO NOT KNOW HOWEVER YOU SHALL NOT FAIL FOR ANY LACK OF WILLINGNESS ON MY PART I WILL TELL YOU OF IT AND DO TRY TO FOLLOW IF YOU CAN

THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN GUIDED THUS FAR IN THE MYSTERIES OF LOVE AND WHO HAS DIRECTED HIS THOUGHTS TOWARDS EXAMPLES OF BEAUTY IN DUE AND ORDERLY SUCCESSION WILL SUDDENLY HAVE REVEALED TO HIM AS HE APPROACHES THE END OF HIS INITIATION A BEAUTY WHOSE NATURE IS MARVELOUS INDEED THE FINAL GOAL SOCRATES OF ALL HIS PREVIOUS EFFORTS ENLIGHTENMENT THIS BEAUTY IS FIRST OF ALL ETERNAL IT NEITHER COMES INTO BEING NOR PASSES AWAY NEITHER WAXES OR WANES NEXT IT IS NOT BEAUTIFUL IN PART AND UGLY IN PART NOT BEAUTIFUL AT ONE TIME AND UGLY AT ANOTHER NOR BEAUTIFUL IN THIS RELATION AND UGLY IN THAT NOR BEAUTIFUL HERE AND UGLY THERE AS VARYING ACCORDING TO ITS BEHOLDERS NOR AGAIN WILL THIS BEAUTY APPEAR TO HIM LIKE THE BEAUTY OF A FACE OR HANDS OR ANYTHING ELSE CORPOREAL OR LIKE THE BEAUTY OF A THOUGHT OR A SCIENCE OR LIKE BEAUTY WHICH HAS ITS SEAT IN SOMETHING OTHER THAN ITSELF BE IT A LIVING THING OR THE EARTH OR THE SKY OR ANYTHING ELSE WHATEVER HE WILL SEE IT AS ABSOLUTE EXISTING ALONE WITH ITSELF UNIQUE ETERNAL AND ALL OTHER BEAUTIFUL THINGS PARTAKING OF IT YET IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WHILE THEY COME INTO BEING AND PASS AWAY IT NEITHER UNDERGOES ANY INCREASE OR DIMINUTION NOR SUFFERS ANY CHANGE

WHEN A MAN STARTING FROM THIS SENSIBLE WORLD AND MAKING HIS WAY UPWARD BEGINS TO CATCH SIGHT OF THAT BEAUTY HE IS VERY NEAR HIS GOAL THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY OF APPROACHING OR BEING INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF LOVE TO BEGIN WITH EXAMPLES OF BEAUTY IN THIS WORLD AND USING THEM AS STEPS TO ASCEND CONTINUALLY WITH THAT ABSOLUTE BEAUTY AS ONE'S AIM FROM ONE INSTANCE OF PHYSICAL BEAUTY TO TWO AND FROM TWO TO ALL THEN FROM PHYSICAL BEAUTY TO MORAL BEAUTY AND FROM MORAL BEAUTY TO BEAUTY OF KNOWLEDGE UNTIL FROM KNOWLEDGE OF VARIOUS KINDS ONE ARRIVES AT THE SUPREME KNOWLEDGE WHOSE SOLE OBJECT IS THAT ABSOLUTE BEAUTY AND KNOWS AT LAST WHAT ABSOLUTE BEAUTY IS

THIS ABOVE ALL OTHERS IS THE REGION WHERE A MAN'S LIFE SHOULD BE SPENT IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF ABSOLUTE BEAUTY A MAN SHOULD DEVOTE HIMSELF TO CULTIVATING TOWARDS ENLIGHTENMENT WHAT MAY WE SUPPOSE TO BE THE FELICITY OF THE MAN WHO SEES ABSOLUTE BEAUTY IN ITS ESSENCE PURE AND UNALLOYED WHO INSTEAD OF A BEAUTY TAINTED BY HUMAN FLESH AND COLOUR AND A MASS OF PERISHABLE RUBBISH IS ABLE TO APPREHEND DIVINE BEAUTY WHERE IT EXISTS APART AND ALONE DO YOU THINK THAT IT WILL BE A POOR LIFE THAT A MAN LEADS WHO HAS HIS GAZE FIXED IN THAT DIRECTION WHO CONTEMPLATES ABSOLUTE BEAUTY WITH THE APPROPRIATE FACULTY AND IS IN CONSTANT UNION WITH IT DO YOU NOT SEE THAT IN THAT REGION ALONE WHERE HE SEES BEAUTY WITH THE FACULTY CAPABLE OF SEEING IT WILL HE BE ABLE TO BRING FORTH NOT MERE REFLECTED IMAGES OF GOODNESS BUT TRUE GOODNESS BECAUSE HE WILL BE IN CONTACT NOT WITH REFLECTION BUT WITH THE TRUTH AND HAVING BROUGHT FORTH AND NURTURED TRUE GOODNESS HE WILL HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING BELOVED OF GOD AND BECOMING IF EVER A MAN CAN IMMORTAL HIMSELF

FIRST OF ALL EROS OR EROTIC ROMANCE MAY BE THE LOWEST RUNG ON THE LADDER BUT SOCRATES IS SAYING THAT YOU'RE MEANT TO TRANSCEND BEYOND IT AND YOU WILL NOT SEE THE BEATIFIC VISION OTHERWISE IF YOU ARE DWELLING WITHIN THE REALM OF PHYSICAL DESIRE
SOCRATES NEVER INDULGED BUT WAS SAID TO BE IMMUNE FROM SUCH DESIRES THOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THEM

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SYMPOSIUM SOCRATES IS FOUND STANDING IN SUCH A DEEP MEDITATION THAT HE DOES NOT STIR EVEN WHEN CALLED TO HIM HE DOESN'T ENTER THE PARTY UNTIL AN HOUR OR SO AFTER IN PHAEDO HE EXPLAINED THE PRACTICE OF THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER WHICH IS TO PREPARE ONESELF FOR DEATH BY TURNING INWARDS TOWARDS THE SOUL AND FORGETTING ABOUT THE DESIRES OF THE BODY THIS IS THE SAME PRACTICE THE WORLD OVER SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT
CONSIDERING SEXUALITY IS NATURAL SUPPRESSING IT LEADS TO LYING AND HYPOCRISY OF EXPRESSING TO OTHERS HOW PURE YOU ARE AND IMPLYING YOU ARE BETTER THAN OTHER PEOPLE THAT DO INDULGE BUT THEY ARE USUALLY LYING

LEWD PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WITH INTERESTING FETISHES ARE QUITE HONEST AND OPEN IN MY EXPERIENCE IF THEY TALK OPENLY ABOUT THEIR SEXUALITY AND SEX PRACTICES WHEN ASKED THEY DEFINITELY ARE NOT HIDING MUCH FROM YOU AND PEOPLE WITH FETISHES GENERALLY HAVE DONE QUITE A BIT OF DEEP SELF ANALYSIS AND KNOW WHAT THEY LIKE

SO I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS ONE

IF YOU SUPPRESS YOURSELF YOU DENY YOURSELF
IT'S THAT SKINNERS VOICE

THE TITLE OF THE POST IS MISLEADING THE VIDEO PRESENTS THE IDEA THAT SEXUAL DESIRE IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS MORALITY OR APPRECIATION OF THE FORM OF BEAUTY

MORALITY IS NOT THE SAME AS RIGHTEOUSNESS
I CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE HE IS COMING FROM HAS ANYONE EVERY ABSTAINED FROM SEXUAL INTERCOURSE OR MASTURBATION FOR OVER TWO WEEKS IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MIND WE BECOME MORE AWARE MORE INTERESTED SHARPER I FALL IN LOVE WITH PEOPLE MORE FALL IN LOVE WITH IDEAS AND THOUGHTS THIS IS THE ASCENSION HE SPEAKS OF IT'S INNATE IN US WE JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND USE IT FOR THE GOOD I THINK IN A WAY HE SPEAKS OF SEXUAL TRANSMUTATION
IN THE REPUBLIC THERE IS ALSO SOME BRIEF MENTION OF THIS WHERE SOCRATES DESCRIBES THE MOTIVATIONS OF THE INTELLECTUAL AND PHILOSOPHER AS A DESIRE WHICH COULD BE DESCRIBED AS A SEXUAL DESIRE THAT IT IS SO BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL OF A DESIRE WHICH DRIVES THE SEARCH FOR THE GOOD IN THOSE INTELLECTUALS SUCH AS SOCRATES HOWEVER THIS MAY BE AN UNRELATED I'M NOT SURE
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A FORMAL STORY THAT EXPRESSED THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS APPRECIATED BEAUTY INTERESTING VIDEO IS THERE FURTHER READING ON LADDER OR SIMILAR CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF BEAUTY BEYOND SYMPOSIUM
IT'S INHERENT IN TANTRIC SCRIPTURE THAT SEX CAN LEAD TO THE TRANSMUNDANE
WELL I GUESS I AM NOT RIGHTEOUS ANYMORE TAKE THAT CATHOLIC CHURCH
NOT SURE IF LUST IS AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE BOTTOM RUNG AS THE APPRECIATION OF BEAUTY CAN BE VERY PLATONIC THUS COMPLETELY DEVOID OF LUST IT IS AN INTERESTING TAKE THOUGH AND I COULD EASILY IMAGINE ADDING ONE MORE BOTTOM STEP TO START WITH APPRECIATE YOUR OWN BEAUTY AND YOURSELF
YOU COULD APPLY AN INTROSPECTIVE FORM OF THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC TO EXPLAIN IT WHEN WE ARE YOUNG WE TEND TO HAVE UNBRIDLED AND IMPRUDENT DESIRES IN GENERAL BECAUSE WE HAD YET TO ESTABLISH A STRONG SENSE OF SELF SEXUAL DESIRE IS THE LATEST BIOLOGICAL IMPULSE THAT WE DEVELOP AND BECAUSE IT REVOLVES AROUND AESTHETIC PRINCIPLES AS WELL IT IS UNIQUELY OUR OWN AS WE LEARN THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO THE EXPERIENCES WE PUT OURSELVES IN AND DISCOVER WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE WELL BY OUR INDIVIDUALLY CREATED DEFINITIONS WE BECOME MORE PRUDENT AND START TO ZERO IN ON WHAT WE WANT TO BE AS OUR FULLY ACTUALIZED SELVES AND GAIN A SENSE OF WISDOM FROM THIS WHICH MANIFESTS IN THE FORM OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHO KNOWS
ANYBODY HAVE A DIRECT LINK TO THE VIDEO I CAN'T SEEM TO LOAD IT IN BROWSER ON MOBILE
I READ THIS IN FOGHORN LEGHORNS VOICE
PRETTY SURE THAT SOCRATES WAS ONLY REFERENCING DIOTIMAS THEORY NOT ACTUALLY ARGUING FOR THE THEORY HIMSELF I WOULD HAVE TO READ SYMPOSIUM AGAIN TO RECALL CORRECTLY THE EXACT CONTEXT IN WHICH HE WAS MAKING THIS REFERENCE BUT IT SOUND LIKE A THEORY HE WOULD SUPPORT
DESIRE IN MODERATION
REMOVED
SOCRATES BELIEVED IN SOMETHING THAT WAS PREORDAINED INTO HIS AND ALL OF OUR MINDS EVERYONE FUCKS AND WANTS TO FUCK UNLESS YOU'RE SOME INTROVERTED WEIRDO THAT GETS OFF ON NOT GETTING OFFICIAL
REALLY I READ SYMPOSIUM IN COLLEGE AND REALLY FOUND MYSELF DISAGREEING WITH EVERYTHING THEY SAID INCLUDING THIS I DON'T THINK THE IDEA THAT LUST IS CONNECTED AT ALL TO MORALITY REALLY SHOWS ITSELF MUCH IN MODERN TIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM THE GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT MAN WAS CREATED BY A HIGHER POWER RATHER THAN JUST BEING ANOTHER ANIMAL I HONESTLY THINK THIS NOTION WAS TRUE AT THE TIME BUT NONSENSE NOW
AREN'T MOST PEOPLE AT STEP 2 OTHER THAN THE RELIGIOUS ARGUMENTS I DON'T SEE HOW HUMANS REPRESS DESIRE OR AREN'T MOVING UP THE LADDER

HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO JUST SEE THE THINGS IN OUR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IF THESE THINGS OFTEN APPEAR DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE

SIMPLE WE HAVE CIRCUITS IN OUR BRAINS THAT TAKE THE SENSE DATA AND RUN IT THROUGH ALGORITHMS UNTIL WE PERCEIVE THE ACTUAL FORM OF THE PHYSICAL THING BEST PART WE CAN AFFECT THE CIRCUITS EITHER CONSCIOUSLY OR THOUGH NEURAL DARWINISM TO PERCEIVE THE PHYSICAL OBJECT WICH MORE AND MORE OBJECTIVITY
SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO DR EUGEN FISCHER UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA PRESENTS THE ARGUMENT FROM ILLUSION THIS ARGUMENT APPEARS TO REFUTE OUR CONCEPTION OF PERCEPTION SEEING HEARING ETC TOGETHER WITH PARALLEL ARGUMENTS IT RAISES THE PROBLEM OF PERCEPTION THAT HAS BEEN A OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY SINCE THE MID CENTURY

IT STOPPED JUST AS IT STARTED GETTING INTERESTING BUT THAT'S JUST HOW I SAW IT
WASN'T THIS DISCUSSED BY DESCARTES IN THE SECOND MEDITATION WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THE MELTING CANDLE AND HE CONCLUDES THAT IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF HIS ABILITY TO IMAGINE ALL THE POSSIBLE SHAPE THAT THE CANDLE MIGHT TAKE BUT INSTEAD IS SOMETHING INNATE IN HIS CONNOTATIVE CAPACITIES THAT TELLS HIM IT IS THE SAME CANDLE EVEN IF DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE CANDLE HE KNEW HAD SEEN A PRIORI WHAT IS THE PROBLEM EXACTLY
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE JUMP FROM THIS THING LOOKS DIFFERENT WHEN I PUT IT IN WATER TO THIS THING MUST NOT BE REAL OR WE DON'T SEE THE REAL THING WE SEE ITS IMAGE SENSE-DATUM ONLY VIA APPEALS TO SPOOKINESS DOES THIS FOLLOW

THIS NOTION THAT WE ARE CUT OFF FROM THE OBJECT SAYS TOO MUCH EXPERIENCE IS MEDIATED SAYS ENOUGH

IF I PUT A PHOTOSHOP FILTER OVER A PICTURE I DON'T PROCLAIM OH I MUST NOT REALLY SEE THE REAL PICTURE BUT ONLY THE FILTER

WE DO DIRECTLY PERCEIVE OBJECTS THOUGH THEY ARE MEDIATED WE DO NOT ONLY SEE SENSE DATA THERE IS NO MATRIX NO SIMULATION THANKS

I BELIEVE IF AN AUTOMATED CAR WAS TO CRASH YOU SHOULD HOLD THE SOFTWARE DESIGNER ENGINEER ACCOUNTABLE THEY PROPOSED THE SOFTWARE AND STATED IT WAS SAFE TO USE ASSUMING EVERYTHING ELSE WITH THE CAR EAST G ELECTRONICS WERE FULLY FUNCTIONAL THEY WERE CLEARLY WRONG

THERE'LL CERTAINLY BE FORMS OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS THAT EXHIBIT ACTIVITY THAT WE'D RECOGNIZE ON SOME MEASURE AS CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE

BUT WE SHOULDN'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF CLASSING THEM ALL AS ONE TYPE OF CONSCIOUSNESS ANYMORE THAN WE SHOULD MAKE THE MISTAKE OF CLASSING BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS AS ONE TYPE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

WE NEED TO EVOLVED OUR UNDERSTANDING AND SCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS DIFFICULT AS IT MAY BE FOR US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ONE OF THOSE ADVANCED SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT THE APPROPRIATE RIGHTS TO ASSIGN THEM

AND WE'RE CURRENTLY VERY FAR FROM SUCH AN OUTCOME
OOH TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS IS IT POSSIBLE AND IF IT IS WHAT RIGHTS NEED EXIST IF ANY

I WOULD GO FURTHER AND SAY IT IS NOT ARTIFICIAL CONCIOUSNESS ALONE THAT WE SEEK BUT A MORAL ARTIFICIAL CONCIOUSNESS NOBODY WANTS A T TERMINATOR STOMPING AROUND STEALING OUR GIRLFRIENDS AND KILLING OUR PUPPIES

THE QUESTION OF RIGHTS MAY BE BOUND BY CONCIOUSNESS CONSTRAINTS ARE RIGHTS A REQUIREMENT FOR MORAL CONCIOUSNESS IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A MORAL CONCIOUSNESS TO EXIST WITHOUT RIGHTS I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A DECIDABLE THAT CAN BE SOLVED IN ADVANCE OF ARTIFICIAL CONCIOUSNESS ITSELF

AS TO IS IT POSSIBLE FOR SILICON TO WORK OUR BRAINS MUST BE DETERMINISTIC HAVE WE PROVEN THAT TO BE TRUE OR COULD WE BE INFINITE AUTOMATONS TRYING TO EXPRESS CONCIOUSNESS IN DETERMINISTIC FINITE DOES SUCH A CONVERSION EVEN EXIST WE KNOW IN THE FINITE WORLD IT DOES BUT IN THE WORLD OF THE INFINITE
NOT AT ALL

I AM ASKING

WILL SUCH MACHINE ALSO COME WITH EMOTIONS AND EMOTIONAL RESPONSES

IS THAT ASPECT POSSIBLE

AND WHERE DO EMOTIONS STEM FROM

SUCH AS
ANGER
LOVE

OR EVEN INTUITION
IF THERE IS SUCH A METAPHYSICAL THING
WHY IS THE TERM ARTIFICIAL USED WE'RE NATURAL AND WE MADE IT IS JUST ANOTHER ITERATION OF NATURAL I THINK AI IS ANTHROPOMORPHIZED AS A MONSTER OUT OF FEAR THAT WE'RE AWARE OF HOW WEAK AND TENUOUS AT BEST OUR OWN CONCIOUSNESS IS AND IT WOULD BE EASILY SURPASSED BY SOMETHING LESS INSTINCTIVELY BEHAVIORALLY INCLINED
YES IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT ETHICISTS CAN MAKE OF CYBERNETIC TECHNOLOGY ASSUMING WE STILL HAVE ETHICISTS WHEN IT HAPPENS

ONE ISSUE THAT COMES TO MIND IS THAT AS MINDS MERGE WITH TECHNOLOGY WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO RETHINK CASES WHERE OUR CURRENT STANDARDS TREAT OUR MINDS AND OUR TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES DIFFERENTLY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE QUESTION OF COPYRIGHT RIGHT NOW OUR STANDARDS FOR MINDS AND FOR TECHNOLOGY ARE VERY DIFFERENT IF YOU PLAY A SONG TO ME AND I HEAR IT AND IT GETS STUCK IN MY HEAD THAT'S FINE IF I WHISTLE A FEW BARS OF IT TO SOMEONE ELSE SOMETIMES THAT'S FINE TOO ON THE OTHER HAND IF I HAVE MY COMPUTER RECEIVE THE SONG INSTEAD AND SAVE IT AS A FILE THAT I CAN PLAY FOR MYSELF AND SHARE WITH OTHERS MANY WOULD SAY THAT I HAVE STOLEN SOMETHING AND THEREFORE DONE SOMETHING WRONG SO THE MIND AND THE COMPUTER HAVE VERY DIFFERENT STANDARDS

BUT NOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE MIND AND THE COMPUTER MERGE SUPPOSE THAT WE DEVELOP A TECHNIQUE WHEREBY AN INDIVIDUAL WITH AN IMPAIRED MEMORY CAN HAVE A HARD DRIVE IMPLANTED IN THEIR HEAD WHICH WOULD TAKE OVER THE FUNCTION OF RECORDING SENSE DATA THOUGHTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND OF PRESENTING THAT INFORMATION TO THE REST OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S MIND NOW WHEN THAT PERSON HEARS A SONG THEY RECORD IT JUST AS MY COMPUTER DOES THEY HAVE IN THEIR HEAD THE SAME FILE THAT MY COMPUTER CREATES ARE THEY TO BE FORBIDDEN FROM REMEMBERING THE MUSIC THAT THEY HEAR FROM GETTING A SONG STUCK IN THEIR HEAD PLAYING OVER AND OVER AS HAPPENS FOR EVERYONE ELSE THAT SEEMS BOTH DISCRIMINATORY AND HORRIFYINGLY INVASIVE NOW WHAT IF PEOPLE WHO HAD HAD SUCH A SURGERY EITHER BY NEED OR ELECTIVELY FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING A BETTER MEMORY ALSO HAD IN THEIR CYBERNETICS AND COULD SEND FILES DIRECTLY TO ONE ANOTHER DOWNLOAD FILES FROM OR UPLOAD FILES TO THE INTERNET ETC WOULD THAT JUSTIFY IMPOSING ALL OF THE LICENSING RESTRICTIONS THAT OUR COMPUTER CONTENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ON THE CONTENTS OF THEIR MINDS OR NOT

HERE'S ANOTHER WRINKLE TO THIS PUZZLE ONE INSPIRED BY THE IDEA OF THE EXTENDED MIND IF WE THINK THAT IT IS ABLEST AND INVASIVE TO PLACE LICENSING RESTRICTIONS ON THE CONTENTS OF AN IMPLANTED HARD DRIVE IN SOMEONE'S HEAD WHAT SHOULD WE SAY ABOUT PEOPLE NOW WHO USE EXTERNAL DEVICES FOR THE SAME PURPOSE HOW IF AT ALL DOES THE QUESTION OF HOW GOOD THE DEVICE'S INTERFACE IS SINCE THAT'S REALLY ALL THAT THE INTERNAL EXTERNAL DISTINCTION AMOUNTS TO GET TO BE MORALLY RELEVANT AND IF WE THINK THAT FORCES US TO ALLOW SAY SOMEONE WITH TO RECORD WHAT THEY CANNOT REMEMBER WHY SHOULD THE REST OF US HAVE TO RELY ON THE VAGARIES OF MEAT FOR THE SAME PURPOSE

VERY INTERESTING THANKS FOR THE AMA
I HAD SOME QUESTIONS

I EXTREMELY APPRECIATED LANGUAGE CRITICS FOR AS MUCH THE REMAINDER OF THE POSITIVIST POSITIONS ARE SURPASSED I'M NOT AWARE OF CRITICS OR ADVANCEMENTS IN THIS FIELD WHAT'S YOUR POSITION AND ARE THERE ANY NEWER THEORIES


SPEAKING OF CONSPIRACY THEORISTS I GUESS YOU ARE AWARE OF SOME OF THE LAST STUDIES HOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THIS LIKE BEHAVIOR

I MEAN WE ALL ARE USED TO GENUINE ARGUMENTS USUALLY STRUCTURED TO ADDRESS RIGHT OR WRONG POINTS INSIDE A PROPOSITION LET'S CALL THIS DATA AND CALLING OUT THE SPEAKER IS MOST OF TIMES CONSIDERED IMPOLITE IF NOT A FALLACY

THE AFOREMENTIONED IMPLICIT PSYCHOLOGIC BIAS HOPING I CAN EXPLAIN IS VERY PERSONAL THEN AND THE ONLY WAY TO SPOT INFER IT IF ANY IS A POSTERIORI AFTER SOMEBODY ADVOCATED FLAT EARTH OR CHEMTRAILS

IS THERE ANYBODY THAT EVER TACKLED THIS PROBLEMATIC


YOU SPEAK ABOUT ANARCHISM AND ITS PROBLEMS IS THIS MORE ABOUT PERFECTING IT OR IN A NEGATIVE DESTRUCTING WAY

THANKS
I TOOK EPISTEMOLOGY WITH PROF LYNN IN THOSE WERE SOME GREYBEARD TIMES NOW YEARS LATER I SEE HIM ON REDDIN THE WORLD IS A WEIRD PLACE

HAVE YOU DISCOVERED WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE JUST BRAINS IN VATS YET

HONESTLY IF OUR BRAINS JUST DEAL IN ELECTRICAL IMPULSES FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD IT REALLY WOULDN'T MATTER WHAT WAS PROVIDING THEM AFTER ALL
I AM QUITE INTERESTED ON TESTIMONIAL INJUSTICE CONCEPT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE EVERYWHERE

MY QUESTION IS REGARDING THIS TOPIC CAN WE SAY THAT CHILDREN SUFFER THIS TESTIMONIAL INJUSTICE SOMETIMES THEY JUST TALK FANTASIES BUT I'VE HEARD SOME CHILDREN HAVING REALLY AMAZING IDEAS ABOUT SOMETHING AND GETTING IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED BECAUSE OF THEIR AGES EVEN IF WHAT THEY SAID MADE A LOT OF SENSE
THANK YOU PROF LYNN FOR THIS AMA

RECENT WORK IN PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE HAS CENTERED AROUND PEJORATIVE LANGUAGE WHERE MOST THEORISTS TEND TO AGREE THAT SLURS IN PARTICULAR COMMUNICATE DEROGATORY CONTENTION

MY QUESTION IS THIS DO YOU THINK THERE IS SIGNIFICANT SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE DEROGATION PRESENT IN SLURRING AND THE DEGRADATION PRESENT IN INSTANCES OF TESTIMONIAL INJUSTICE
VERY EXCITING STUFF ALSO GREAT WRITE UP AND INFORMATION THANK YOU FOR TAKING WHAT I'M GUESSING WAS AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME TO INTRODUCE THESE IDEAS AND SUMMARIZE THEM IN A CLEAR AND CONCISE WAY EXCITED TO SEE WHERE THIS AMA GOES
I HAVE REMOVED ALL COMMENTS THAT DON'T CITE THE CONTENT OF THE OP BUT INSTEAD RIFFS ON THE TITLE WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO TO PREVENT THIS THREAD FROM DEGENERATING FURTHER
I'M NOT SURE I BUY THE IMPLICIT CONNECTION MADE BY THE TITLE ARTICLE ITS UNCLEAR FROM THE ARTICLE WHY I SHOULD ESSENTIALLY CONNECT ANTI-SEMITISM WITH HIS OVERALL PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SHED LIGHT ON THAT PLEASE DO

THE AUTHOR SEEMS TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT TO UNDERSTAND ANTI-SEMITISM IS TO BEGIN TO THINK AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH WE CAN'T THINK WITH HIM WITHOUT THINKING ANTI-SEMITIC ALLY

WHY CAN'T I LEAVE THE ANTI-SEMITIC BAD AND TAKE THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXISTENTIALIST GOOD
REMOVED
FOR SOME REASON AMONG PHILOSOPHERS AND INTELLECTUALS THERE SEEMS TO BE PERPETUAL AMNESIA ABOUT THIS SUBJECT

IT USED TO BE ARGUED THAT HEIDEGGER WAS AN UNWORLDLY MAN WHO BRIEFLY BLUNDERED INTO NAZISM THIS WAS THE EXCULPATORY ARGUMENT MADE BY ARENDT IN A RADIO ADDRESS BROADCAST IN GERMANY ON HIS BIRTHDAY THIS ACCOUNT BECAME UNSUSTAINABLE AFTER THE RESEARCH OF FARIAS AND OTT DEMONSTRATED THE DEPTHS OF HEIDEGGER S INVOLVEMENT WITH NAZISM INCLUDING HIS CARRYING OUT OF THE LAW THAT PURGED JEWS FROM UNIVERSITY TEACHING THEN HEIDEGGER S DEFENDERS TRIED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITY WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CULPABLE AND HIS THOUGHT WHICH REMAINED UNTAINTED BUT FAYE PROVED BEYOND A DOUBT THAT IN THE FIRST YEARS OF HITLER S RULE HEIDEGGER TAUGHT SEMINARS IN WHICH HE GAVE HIS MOST FAMOUS PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS AND TERMS AN EXPLICITLY NAZI RESONANCE

THIS IS CONTRADICTORY OUTSIDE OF THE ACTUAL ARGUMENT OF WHETHER HIS PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT IS SO INTERTWINED WITH HIS BEING A NAZI THAT HE CANNOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A PHILOSOPHER WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE STATED GOAL AT THE END WITH THE EXPLICIT CALL TO THINK AGAINST HIM THE ARTICLE GOES BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHETHER THE PROBLEM IS ADDRESSED AT ALL WE WENT OVER IT IN QUITE A BIT OF DETAIL IN A BASIC INTRO TO EXISTENTIALISM CLASS AND I VE NEVER GOTTEN THE IMPRESSION FROM READING ABOUT HIM THAT THE WHOLE THING IS SOMEHOW UNACKNOWLEDGED OR SWEPT UNDER THE RUG AND IF THERE IS GOING BY THE SECOND QUOTE A TRACEABLE HISTORY OF INTELLECTUALS ADDRESSING IT IT FEELS DISINGENUOUS TO IMPLY A WILLFUL IGNORANCE BECAUSE SOMEHOW PEOPLE ARE UNABLE TO FACE THE TRUTH PEOPLE HAVE GRAPPLED WITH IT AND NEW SOURCES MAY SHED MORE LIGHT ON THE ISSUE AND PREVIOUS ARGUMENTS BUT I DON T SEE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CLAIM THAT THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE SHIFTED FROM SOMETHING THE AUTHOR PROVIDES EVIDENCE ISN T EVEN THE CASE

AND THERE SEEM TO BE A LOT OF UNFOUNDED JUMPS LIKE THIS THAT I THINK UNDERMINE THE AUTHOR S ARGUMENT EX

BEING AND TIME WAS THE FIRST BOOK OF PHILOSOPHY I HAD READ THAT SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN CONDITION IN THE SAME WAY THAT LITERATURE DID LESS THROUGH ABSTRACT INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTS THAN THROUGH THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF MOOD FOR HEIDEGGER EXISTENCE IN GERMAN DASEIN IS GRASPED FIRST AND FOREMOST NOT BY THE RATIONAL MIND BUT BY THE EMOTIONS THAT DETERMINE THE VERY SHAPE AND TEXTURE OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE

THIS IS A MINOR POINT BUT A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUE THE AUTHOR IS DISCUSSING THE ALLURE OF HEIDEGGER ASSUMEDLY TO LATER DISPUTE ITS VALIDITY AS THOUGH DEFENDERS OF HIS THOUGHT ARE TAKEN IN BY THE ROMANCE OF HIS WORK BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD THROUGH THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF MOOD I EAST BY CONVEYING AND EVOKING THE MOODS THEMSELVES AND ARGUING IN DELIBERATELY COINED ABSTRACT TERMS THAT EMOTIONAL EXPERIENTIAL UNDERSTANDING WAS HOW A BEING ENCOUNTERS THE WORLD SO LATER WHEN THE AUTHOR SAYS

IN THIS WAY HEIDEGGER S EXISTENTIALISM HIS METHOD OF UNDERSTANDING THE WORLD NOT THROUGH CONCEPTS BUT THROUGH THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF EXISTENCE LEADS TO A PARTICULAR ETHICAL STANCE

I THINK THE TWO THINGS ARE BEING CONFLATED HEIDEGGER MAY HAVE ARGUED THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE WORLD THROUGH THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF EXISTENCE BUT ON A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL I DON T THINK HIS WORK WAS SHYING AWAY FROM EXPLAINING THAT IN AN ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHICAL WAY THIS LEADS INTO A DISCUSSION OF HOW THIS THEN IMPLIES THE ETHICAL STANCE WHICH THEN COME FROM HIS NOT OVERTLY ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY BUT I DON T THINK ANY GROUNDWORK HAS BEEN LAID THAT ACTUALLY STARTS WITH WHAT HE SAID

SO THE JUMPING OFF POINT CAN BE THAT HIS PHILOSOPHY DOESN T HAVE A LOT TO EXPLICITLY SAY ABOUT ETHICS WHICH I DON T THINK IS CONTROVERSIAL BUT THE LEAD UP OF THE ARTICLE TO THIS POINT COMES OFF AGAIN AS A DISINGENUOUS FRAMING OF ACADEMICS INTELLECTUALS WHO WOULD DEFEND HIS PHILOSOPHY


EVEN STARTING FROM THE LOW HANGING POINT THAT HIS PHILOSOPHY WASN T CONCERNED WITH ETHICS THE AUTHOR SAYS

IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE LIFE IS MEANINGLESS BECAUSE IT HAS NO VALUE OR PURPOSE IMPOSED ON IT FROM ABOVE OR OUTSIDE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HUMAN BEING MUST ENDOW IT WITH MEANING BY DECIDING ON AN AUTHENTIC EXISTENCE

WHICH I THINK IS A COMMON ENOUGH EXISTENTIAL THEME THAT IF AN INDICTMENT IS BUILT FROM THAT STANCE IT WOULD CALL IN QUITE A FEW MORE THINKERS THAN JUST HEIDEGGER SO THE REST OF THAT PARAGRAPH IN WHICH THE AUTHENTICITY AND DECISION IN THE PRECEDING STATEMENT ARE THE BASIS FOR ARGUING THAT HEIDEGGER S THOUGHT LEADS TO SOLIPSISTIC MORAL RELATIVISM WHICH HAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR NAZISM WOULD I THINK APPLY EQUALLY WELL TO SEVERAL OTHER LEADING EXISTENTIALISTS

NONE OF THIS IS TO SAY THAT HE WASN T ANTI-SEMITIC OR NOT A SHITTY GUY BUT THE ARGUMENT THAT HIS ANTI-SEMITISM SPRUNG INEVITABLY FROM HIS PHILOSOPHY ITSELF AND SO HIS PHILOSOPHY MUST BE DISCARDED OR EVEN THOUGHT AGAINST ISN T BEING EFFECTIVELY MADE

I'M UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT OPINIONS ON THESE ISSUES ARE A LOT MORE COMPLICATED THAN WHAT ARTICLES LIKE THIS TRY TO PACKAGE IN THE HISTORY OF BEING HEIDEGGER GETS VERY CONFRONTATIONAL WITH NAZISM COMMUNISM AND THE PECULIARITY OF BLAMING THE JEWS FOR PLANETARY CRIMINALITY HE THEN STATES THAT THE MAJOR PLANETARY CRIMINALS OF THE MODERN AGE CAN BE COUNTED ON THE FINGERS OF ONE HAND TO ME THIS IS MEANT TO BE STALIN AND HITLER WHOM HE PRETTY CONSISTENTLY HAMMERS IN THE PAGES LEADING UP TO THIS PASSAGE

LATER IN THE VOLUME IN THE ESSAY OUT OF THE HISTORY OF BEING HE IS EVEN MORE DIRECTLY CRITICAL OF THE SOVIET UNION AND SOCIALISM HINT HINT AND HOW THEIR CONSTANT PURSUIT OF POWER WIPES OUT WHATEVER LEGITIMACY THESE REGIMES ONCE POSSESSED GIVEN THAT THESE WERE LECTURES HE WAS GIVING IN AND THEY DRONE ON AND ON ABOUT THE EMPTY PURSUIT OF POWER THE SOVIET UNION AND NATIONAL SOCIALISTS ARE INVOLVED IN IT SURE APPEARS THAT HEIDEGGER WAS NOT ENCOURAGING FASCISM OR THE NAZI IDEOLOGY

THE ANTIEMETIC REMARKS CITED IN THIS ARTICLE ARE MORE OFFHANDED COMMENTARY THAN PROOF OF A DEEP INVOLVEMENT WITH THE NAZI IDEOLOGY DO I THINK HEIDEGGER LAPSED INTO SOME PRETTY STUPID AND UGLY MOMENTS OF ANTISEMITISM ABSOLUTELY DO I THINK THAT HEIDEGGER WAS REALLY A REAL NAZI NO AND I THINK ARTICLES LIKE THIS SENSATIONALIZE INFORMATION IN TRYING TO MAKE THAT CASE HE LIKE MANY OF THE PEOPLE EARLY ON IN THE REGIME FOOLISHLY ALIGNED HIMSELF WITH THE PARTY WHICH IS WHY HE CALLED IT THE GREATEST STUPIDITY OF HIS LIFE

AS FOR THE FACT THAT HE NEVER APOLOGIZED I'VE ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE REFUSED TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE HE FELT THAT EXPRESSIONS OF POWER LIKE THE HOLOCAUST WERE SYMPTOMATIC OF THE MODERN AGE A BELIEF WHICH HANNAH ARENDT SHARED AND THAT THE WESTERN POWERS PARTICULARLY THE UNITED STATES WERE JUST AS LIKELY TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE I READ THAT LAST PART BUT I REMEMBER IT FROM SOMEWHERE

ALSO HE WAS A HUGELY EGOTISTICAL ASSHOLE WHICH IS PROBABLY THE REAL REASON HE NEVER APOLOGIZED
ALMOST EVERY REPORT IN THIS SUB CURRENTLY COMES FROM THIS THREAD AND ALMOST NONE OF THE DISCUSSION MAKES ANY REFERENCE TO THE OP SINCE USEFUL DISCUSSION SEEMS TO HAVE RUN ITS COURSE WE'VE NOW LOCKED THIS POST IT'LL REMAIN UP BUT NO MORE COMMENTS ON IT CAN BE POSTED
I FEEL LIKE THE FOUNTAINHEAD OR ATLAS SHRUGGED IS A LOT LIKE SIDDHARTHA OR ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE IN THAT IT SPEAKS MOST STRONGLY TO FOLKS WHO ARE FEELING REALLY IDEALISTIC

USUALLY OF COURSE THAT MEANS TEENAGERS

THOSE BOOKS ARE ALL ABOUT POINTING OUT THE BULLSHIT OF LIFE HUMAN SOCIETY AND PROPOSING A WAY TO LIVE A MORE VIRTUOUS LIFE

BOOKS ARE THE APOLOGIA FOR A SELF-INTERESTED AND WAY OF LIFE SIDDHARTHA APPEALS TO WANDERERS AND FOLKS WHO JUST WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD ZATAOMM SPEAKS TO PEOPLE WHO FIND MEANING IN CRAFT AND CREATION BUT WHO AREN'T READY TO INSIST THAT THE WHOLE WORLD BE REMADE TO FIT THEIR IDEOLOGY

THESE VERY DOGMATIC SIMPLISTIC AND YET IDEOLOGIES AND STORIES SPEAK STRONGLY TO US AS IDEALISTIC TEENAGERS WHO HAVE JUST STARTED TO IDENTIFY THE HYPOCRISY AND GENERAL SHORTCOMINGS OF OUR ELDERS OUR INHERITED SOCIETY AT THE SAME TIME THEY LACK THE INSIGHT AND RESTRAINT THAT COMES WITH EXPERIENCING THE SHITTINESS OF GROUPTHINK AND CULLY SHIT AND ABSOLUTISM

I THINK THAT ALL OF THOSE BOOKS ARE WORTH READING AND EVEN GETTING INTO WHILE YOU ARE YOUNG

HOWEVER I TAKE IT AS A SIGN OF INTELLECTUAL IMMATURITY IF SOMEONE CONTINUES TO FLOG ANY OF THESE TEXTS INTO ADULTHOOD

THEY ALL BUT PARTICULARLY BOOKS JUST DON'T ALLOW FOR NUANCED UNDERSTANDING WITH HER ABSOLUTE AND POORLY SUPPORTED PRONOUNCEMENTS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THEIR REACTIVE AND EMOTIONALLY PRICKLY QUALITIES SHE APPEALS MOST TO PEOPLE WHO WOULD PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR BELIEFS ARE OBJECTIVE RATHER THAN CONSIDER CRITICISM OF THOSE BELIEFS OR COUNTEREXAMPLES

I ALSO FIND IT PERSONALLY DISTASTEFUL THAT OBJECTIVISM CAN SO BLITHELY AND CONFIDENTLY DISMISS ALTRUISM AND KINDNESS AS WEAK AND MISGUIDED WHILE ELEVATING SELFISHNESS AND GREED TO POSITIONS OF VIRTUE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN AMORAL PHILOSOPHY WHICH COULD EXIST ON AN OBJECTIVE AND PRACTICAL FOUNDATION AND A TWISTED FORM OF MORAL PRESCRIPTIVISM THAT PROMULGATES GREED AND SELF-INTEREST IT'S NOT VERY INTELLECTUALLY HONEST TO PRETEND THAT ONE'S BELIEFS ARE OBJECTIVE AND IMPASSIVELY UNEMOTIONAL AND DRIVEN BY INTELLECT ON THE ONE HAD WHILE SHOWING RESENTMENT REACTIVE ANTIPATHY AND EMOTIONAL CRUELTY TO ONE'S RIVALS ON THE OTHER

THANKS FOR THE POST OP ENJOYED IT
ONE OF THE POINTS IN THIS VIDEO ECHOES ONE OF MY CHIEF COMPLAINTS AGAINST AYN RAND OP SAYS FOR ALL HER TALK OF RATIONALITY RAND TENDS TO USE SENTIMENT RATHER THAN ARGUMENT TO ADVANCE HER CLAIMS I AGREE AND WOULD GO FURTHER TO SAY SHE ABUSES THE CONVENTIONS OF FICTION FOR HER PURPOSES WHICH MAY BE CONSISTENT WITH HER PHILOSOPHY OF SELF-INTEREST BUT IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO GOOD PHILOSOPHY

FICTION CAN BE USED TO ILLUSTRATE OR DRAMATIZE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENT SEE DIALOGUES BUT THE ARGUMENT SHOULD BE LEFT TO SPEAK FOR ITSELF RAND LIKES TO CONFLATE THE IDEAS OF HER PROTAGONISTS WITH THEIR CHARACTERS AND STORY LINE TO THE EXTENT THAT SHE ENGENDERS SYMPATHY FOR SAY HOWARD ROARK SHE PERSUADES UNCRITICAL READERS THAT HER IDEAS AS EXPRESSED THROUGH HIM ARE ALSO RIGHT THE WAY SHE TELLS THE STORY PEOPLE WHO GIVE VOICE TO HER IDEAS ARE GOOD AND NOBLE AND AFTER MUCH SUFFERING WILL ULTIMATELY BE VINDICATED WHEREAS EVERYONE ELSE IS A DESPICABLE UNSCRUPULOUS AND UNSYMPATHETIC PERSON WHO NOT ONLY HAS WRONG IDEAS BUT HOLDS THEM FOR NEFARIOUS REASONS I EAST A BAD GUY

AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THAT'S CHEATING IT MAKES FOR BAD FICTION AND UNDERMINES RATIONAL DEBATE
RAND WAS JUST NOT WELL READ IN PHILOSOPHY

HER IDEAS DO MAKE SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE AMERICAN OBSESSION WITH FINDING HACKS TO EXCEED ORDINARY HUMAN ABILITIES HOWEVER THAT TRADITION GOES BACK TO BENJAMIN AUTOBIOGRAPHY WE SEE OTHER EXAMPLES OF THIS IN THE CENTURY LIKE GENERAL SEMANTICS SCIENTOLOGY AND THE S DRUG CULTURE

FOR EXAMPLE RAND SHOWS IN ATLAS SHRUGGED WHAT I CALL OPERATING OBJECTIVIST WHO HAVE SEEMINGLY SUPERHUMAN POWERS THAT THEY CAN ACTIVATE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE CORRECT PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLES AS RAND UNDERSTANDS THEM FRANCISCO INDEPENDENTLY INVENTS DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS WHEN HE WAS A CHILD HANK REARDEN CAN DESIGN A NEW KIND OF BRIDGE IN HIS MIND AND PERFORM MENTAL ARITHMETIC ON THE FLY AND JOHN GALT A SEXUALLY INEXPERIENCED MAN IN HIS S MASTERFULLY HANDLES HIS UNEXPECTED CONFRONTATION WITH HIS CRUSH DAGNY TAGGART WHEN SHE CRASHES HER PLANE IN GULCH

THOUGH THE LAST PART IS JUST PREPOSTEROUS MEN LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH WOMEN THROUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE NOT FROM STUDYING PHILOSOPHY

INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH RAND PUTS A DISCLAIMER ABOUT WHAT HER PHILOSOPHY ALLEGEDLY DOES IN THE MOUTH OF THE CHARACTER HUGH AKETON THE PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR WHO TAUGHT FRANCISCO JOHN AND THE PIRATE CHARACTER RAGNAR

DON'T BE ASTONISHED MISS TAGGART SAID HUGH AKETON SMILING AND DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF THINKING THAT THESE THREE PUPILS OF MINE ARE SOME SORT OF SUPERHUMAN CREATURES THEY'RE SOMETHING MUCH GREATER AND MORE ASTOUNDING THAN THAT THEY'RE NORMAL MEN A THING THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN AND THEIR FEAT IS THAT THEY HAVE MANAGED TO SURVIVE AS SUCH IT DOES TAKE AN EXCEPTIONAL MIND AND A STILL MORE EXCEPTIONAL INTEGRITY TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THE WORLD'S DOCTRINES THE ACCUMULATED EVIL OF CENTURIES TO REMAIN HUMAN SINCE THE HUMAN IS THE RATIONAL

BUT THEN WHAT RAND SHOWS CONFLICTS WITH WHAT SHE SAYS I CAN SEE WHY HER PHILOSOPHY TENDS TO MAKE ITS DRINKERS DEPRESSED ANXIOUS AND HOSTILE THEY CAN'T LIVE UP TO ITS IMPOSSIBLE STANDARDS I HAVE TO WONDER IF MEN IN ANTIQUITY WHO TRIED TO LIVE UP TO UNREASONABLE STANDARDS SUFFERED FROM SIMILAR PROBLEMS STOICISM RATHER LIKE OBJECTIVISM TEACHES THE ABSOLUTE UNITY OF VIRTUE AND YOU ARE EITHER ABSOLUTELY VIRTUOUS OR YOU ARE A FOOL WITH NO GRADATION BETWEEN THE TWO STATES
AYN RAND IS REQUIRED READING IN MANY PUBLIC SCHOOLS I THINK I'M GOING TO NEED A SOURCE FOR THAT

EDIT I GUESS THIS DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
BACK IN COLLEGE DURING A TRIP ON SPRING BREAK TO WEST VIRGINIA I RAN ACROSS SOMEONE WHO WAS READING A COPY OF ATLAS SHRUGGED IT WAS WORN AND HAD COLORED BOOKMARK TAGS ALL STICKING OUT ALL OVER FROM IT IT LOOKED NOT TOO MUCH UNLIKE IT WAS HER OWN PERSONAL BIBLE

THEN I WATCHED A YOUNG REALLY SWEET KID GO OVER TO THIS GIRL AND INVITE HER OUT ON A KAYAKING I BELIEVE SHE WAS FASCINATINGLY IRRITATED WITH HIS REQUEST I MEAN ZERO TO SIXTY AND HISSED NO SHE WANTED TO JUST READ HER BOOK SO YEAH THAT GUY LEFT ALL CRESTFALLEN

ANYWAYS I WAS AMUSED AT THIS SCENE SO I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS SO I APPROACHED HER PRETENDING TO BE EITHER STONED OR A MORON AND SAID HEY WHATCHY DOING TO WHICH SHE REPLIED READING I CONTINUED WITH OH WHATCHY READING AND GOT A CURT ATLAS SHRUGGED SO I WENT A LITTLE FURTHER WITH WHAT'S THAT

SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY ANNOYED AT THIS SO SHE GAVE ME A QUICK AND DISMISSIVE ANSWER LIKE THE PHILOSOPHY OF AYN RAND IT'S IS CALLED OBJECTIVISM NOW CAN YOU PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE

I JUST STOOD THERE FOR A MOMENT AND ASKED DID YOU GET TO THE PART WHERE EVERYONE DIES IN THE TRAIN CRASH IN THE MOUNTAIN YET

THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS PRICELESS SHE WAS STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF I READ IT WHEN I ASKED HER IF SHE'D EVER TAKEN THE PAGE JOHN GALT MONOLOGUE IN ONE SITTING OR NOT THEN I SAID HAVE YOU READ THE FOUNTAINHEAD AND SHE STILL AMAZED SAID YES SO I ASKED HAVE YOU READ ANTHEM AND SHE SAID NUMBER SO I SAID YOU DON'T NEED TO IT'S IN THE OTHERS

SHE WAS SO NICE TO ME THE REST OF THAT TRIP



ANYWAYS YEARS LATER I LIKELY EVER WOULDN'T DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT AM UNSURE WHAT I WOULD BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG TIME SINCE I'VE RUN INTO AN OBJECTIVIST I THINK A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO IDEAS WHEN THEY WOULD BE BETTER ENCOURAGED TO EMBRACE SOMETHING LIKE IDEA OF INDIVIDUATION THAT IDEA ALSO ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO THEMSELVES RATHER THAN SOCIETIES DEMANDS ON THEM WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLY VERY IMPORTANT AFTER BEING SUBJECTED TO SUCH AN IMPERSONAL EDUCATIONAL UPBRINGING AS WE HAVE TODAY HOWEVER IT DOESN'T SAY YOU SHOULDN'T BRING YOUR DEVELOPED GIFTS BACK TO SOCIETY WHEN THAT IS APPROPRIATE AND VERY MUCH CAN INCORPORATE ALTRUISM

AS A STORY CONSULTANT I ALSO FIND IT INTERESTING HOW TWO DIMENSIONAL CHARACTER CLUSTERS ARE THERE ARE LITERALLY NO AS IN SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE HEROIC SIDE WHO BECOMES A VILLAIN OR SOMEONE WHO BEGINS A VILLAIN WHO REDEEMS THEMSELVES NO ROOM FOR CHARACTERS LIKE SNAPE GOLLUM VADER ETC

SO HER WORLD IS FASCINATINGLY REMINISCENT OF A TWO DIMENSIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS NOT UNLIKE DON QUIXOTE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO FITS EVERYTHING INTO THEIR OWN MYTHOLOGY FOR RAND IT SEEMED THERE ARE CREATORS OR THERE ARE LEECHES AND THAT'S THAT OF COURSE SHE DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN LOS ANGELES SO IT SORT OF MAKES SENSE SOMEONE WHO DID A LOT OF TIME THERE MIGHT SEE THINGS THIS WAY I'M TEASING

TO THIS DAY I'M HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS OF ANY STORYLINE WHICH DOESN'T FEATURE OR HINT AT ANY TRICKSTER CHARACTERS WHO QUESTION OR OVERRULE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ENTIRE QUEST ESPECIALLY THINGS WHICH ARE MADE TO BE SO UTTERLY EPIC BUT THEN AGAIN TOM BOBADIL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS
THE STRONGEST ARGUMENT AGAINST OBJECTIVISM IS RIGHT IN THE BOOKS THEMSELVES I'VE ONLY READ THE FOUNTAINHEAD BUT ROARKE RAPES A WOMAN AND BLOWS UP A BUILDING AND IS STILL SOMEHOW A HERO IN THE END IT SEEMS LIKE SELF INTEREST HAS TO HAVE A LIMIT AT SOME POINT BUT APPARENTLY RAPE AND TERRORISM ARE CLEARLY WITHIN THOSE LIMITS MAYBE THIS IS ADDRESSED MORE PROPERLY IN OTHER WORKS OF HER BUT IT'S A PRETTY TOUGH PART TO GET PAST IN HER PHILOSOPHY
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

LOVE THUNK HE ALWAYS GIVES A PRETTY LEVEL HEADED EXPLANATION OF WHATEVER HIS TOPIC IS HE'S THE ONLY PERSON I'VE SEEN FAIRLY CRITICIZE AYN RAND WHILE GIVING HER SOME CREDIT I DON'T EVEN LIKE AYN RAND
HERE'S THE PROBLEM I'VE ALWAYS HAD WITH OBJECTIVISM IT USES THE LANGUAGE OF PHILOSOPHY TO DISPARAGE AND ATTEMPT TO INVALIDATE PHILOSOPHY FOR EVERY QUESTION THAT SOME PHILOSOPHICAL DISCIPLINE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLORE OBJECTIVISM HAS AN ANSWER AND IT'S INVARIABLY THAT THE QUESTION IS STUPID AND POINTLESS

METAPHYSICS NONE IF YOU CAN'T DEDUCE IT FROM SENSORY EVIDENCE IT DOESN'T EXIST
EPISTEMOLOGY APPEARANCE IF IT APPEARS SOMETHING IS TRUE AND CAN BE EXPRESSED THEN IT IS
THEOLOGY THERE IS NO GOD AND RELIGION IS A WASTE OF TIME
GOVERNMENT EXTREMELY LIMITED OR NONE POWER SHOULD LIE IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY POWERFUL
ETHICS SELF-INTEREST

AND SO ON

PHILOSOPHY EXISTS FOR A REASON ONCE WE HAVE MASTERED THE ART OF SURVIVAL AND OVERCOME THE PRIMORDIAL STATE OF HUMANITY WE ARE LEFT TO PONDER WHICH WAYS ARE BEST TO ORDER OUR LIVES AND NATURALLY SOMEONE HAD TO ORIGINATE A SET OF PHILOSOPHICAL DOCTRINES THAT SAYS THAT THE PRIMORDIAL STATE OF HUMANITY WAS AFTER ALL THE BEST WAY OF ORDERING OUR LIVES IT WOULD BE COMICAL IF IT DIDN'T ENTRAP THOUSANDS OF YOUNG READERS ANNUALLY
LOL UPVOTES ON REDDIN YET I ONLY SEE VIEWS ON YOUTUBE
PEOPLE WHO FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT ONE LINE OF THINKING OFTEN MOCK THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN A COUNTER OR SOMEWHAT OPPOSED LINE OF THINKING VOLTAIRE HATED LEIBNIZ TO THE POINT OF MAKING DR PANGLOSS A CARICATURE OF THOUGHTS
ANYONE ELSE BOTHERED BY THE LINE AT THE END THAT NOT MANY MINORITIES OR PEOPLE WITH HANDICAPS ARE FANS OF AYN RAND IS THERE ANY DATA BACKING THAT CLAIM UP IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A HUNCH BASED ON BIASES REGARDING HOW CERTAIN CLASSES OF PEOPLE SHOULD THINK RATHER THAN AN OBSERVATION OF HOW THEY ACTUALLY THINK
I READ ATLAS SHRUGGED BECAUSE I VIEWED IT AS THE OPPOSITE END OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM TO MY BELIEFS I ULTIMATELY ENJOYED IT AND FELT LIKE I LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM IT IT FORCED ME TO CONSIDER MY OWN BIASES AND BROUGHT ME CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE

IT'S A WORTHWHILE READ EVEN IF YOU DISLIKE PERSONALITY ABRASIVE APPROACH SOMETIMES HYPOCRITICAL AND FRANKLY NONOBJECTIVE AND OVERARCHING PHILOSOPHY THE STORY ITSELF IS INTERESTING AND STILL RELEVANT TODAY IN MY OPINION THE FICTIONAL CONSOLIDATION OF PARTY POWER INCREASED REGULATIONS AND NATIONALIZATION OF INDUSTRY AND UNABATED CORRUPTION AT THE TOP LEADING TO SOCIETAL DISASTER IS SOMETHING WORTH CONSIDERING TO ME IT'S A WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR THE USA THAT COULD OCCUR IF CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE LOST AND PUBLIC CONTINUES TO STOP PAYING ATTENTION


INTERESTING NOTHING HERE REALLY SEEMS TO ARGUE AGAINST THE CENTRAL ARGUMENTS OF OBJECTIVISM AYN RAND FAILS AT BEING A PHILOSOPHER SHE DOES NOT HONOR OR ADHERE TO RULES OF THE CRAFT SHE HAS DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR SHE MISREPRESENTS OTHER WORK THIS IS TRUE SHE OUGHT TO BE CRITICIZED FOR THIS

BUT AS FAR AS SAYING THAT ALTRUISM IS NOT MORAL THAT MORALITY CAN BE BEST UNDERSTOOD THROUGH A LENS OF RATIONAL SELF INTEREST I DON'T SEE ANY SUBSTANTIVE ARGUMENT AGAINST THAT AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ALWAYS FOUND THE HIVEMIND DISDAIN TOWARDS HER OBVIOUSLY ROOTED IN POLITICAL BIAS
IE YOU ARE ALL LIKELY LEFTISTS I WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION NOW
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH RAND IS THAT IF I WERE TO FOLLOW HER PHILOSOPHY AND I WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK AT ECONOMICS MY RATIONAL SELF-INTEREST WOULD BE TO PROMOTE A UTILITARIAN SOCIETY BASED ON LIBERAL PRINCIPLES

ONE OF THE MOST JARRING THINGS ABOUT ATLAS SHRUGGED WAS THE ALMOST COMPLETE LACK OF ANY MIDDLE-CLASS IT WAS EITHER INDUSTRIALIST MAKERS OR THEIR EMPLOYEE TAKERS WHEN AN INDIVIDUALIST BUSINESS OWNER INTENTIONALLY SCUTTLES HIS BUSINESS TO PUNISH SOCIETY THERE'S NO ONE ANYWHERE TO PICK UP THE SLACK SHOP MACHINES ARE JUST LEFT IDLE NO ONE OFFERS TO BUY THE EQUIPMENT STORE SHELVES GO EMPTY AND COMPETITORS JUST GIVE UP CREATIVE DESTRUCTION COMPETITION SUBSTITUTION AND EVEN BASIC SUPPLY DEMAND DOESN'T FUNCTION IN THIS WORLD

HER PHILOSOPHY ON CAPITALISM IS BASED ON AN ASSUMPTION THAT CAPITALISM AND LIBERALISM DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK AND WE NEED TO EITHER LET EVERYTHING BE RUN BY AN INCOMPETENT GOVERNMENT OR A SELECT CABAL OF UNELECTED TITANS OF INDUSTRY

THIS ACTUALLY SEEMS ANATHEMA TO HER CENTRAL IDEA OF RATIONAL SELF-INTEREST AND PERSONAL LIBERTY IF I'M A NORMAL GUY WHO VOTES WHY WOULD I VOTE FOR SUCH AN INCOMPETENT GOVERNMENT I KNOW SHE SETS IT UP AS THE GOVERNMENT BUYS VOTES WITH HANDOUTS AND THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK IN PETROSTATES BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE SMART ENOUGH NOT TO HENCE WE'RE STILL NOT A COMMUNIST HELLSCAPE YEARS ON HER ASSUMPTION BUILT INTO HER WORK IS THAT ACTUAL PEOPLE ARE TOO STUPID TO FOLLOW SELF-INTEREST AND CAN'T BE TRUSTED WITH LIBERTY
REMOVED
I WAS SURPRISED THAT THIS WAS ACTUALLY A VERY THOUGHTFUL AND LEVEL-HEADED CRITIQUE OF RAND I'M NO FAN OF RAND AND I'M ALSO NOT AN OBJECTIVIST BUT MUCH OF THE VITRIOL AGAINST HER AND MORE EGREGIOUSLY AGAINST OBJECTIVISM BY WAY OF ATTACKS AGAINST HER IS PRETTY CRAPPY EAST G RESTS ON CARICATURES OF HER IDEAS LIKE SELF-INTEREST IRONICALLY THIS IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM WITH RAND WHICH IS THAT HER CRITICISM OF OTHER PHILOSOPHERS RESTS ON CARICATURES OF THEIR IDEAS

ONE KEY THING TO TAKE FROM THIS VIDEO THOUGH IS IT IS MORE A CRITIQUE OF METHOD OF PHILOSOPHY AND THAT PRACTICED BY MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK SHE WAS A GOOD PHILOSOPHER THAN THE CONTENT OF PHILOSOPHY ITSELF THE SPEAKER ADMITS AS MUCH WHEN HE SAYS THAT OBJECTIVISM MIGHT CONTAIN IN IT SOME INTERESTING IDEAS WORTH GIVING SERIOUS CONSIDERATION I DON'T THINK THAT MAINLINE OBJECTIVIST EAST G LEONARD PERKOFF HAVE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO REFINE OBJECTIVISM SINCE DEATH BECAUSE THEY TEND TO PARROT RAND UNTHINKINGLY AND THIS SERVES TO PRESERVE MOST OF HER MISTAKES

ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE SERIOUS PHILOSOPHERS WHO HAVE DEVELOPED TENDENCIES OF IN WAYS THAT I DO THINK ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY INTERESTING A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE DOUGLAS RASMUSSEN AND DOUGLASS DEN CYL WHOSE MOST NOTEWORTHY BOOKS ARE ABOUT USING ARISTOTELIAN MORAL AND POLITICAL THEORY TO JUSTIFY A POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF LIBERALISM LIBERTARIANISM THERE MIGHT BE PROBLEMS HERE BUT I AT LEAST THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING PROJECT WITH A DEFENSIBLE FOUNDATION HOWEVER RASMUSSEN AND DEN CYL ARE NOT OPERATING IN THE MAINSTREAM OF OBJECTIVISM PERKOFF ARI ETC THEY CRITICIZE AND APPROPRIATE SOME OF IDEAS AND LEAVE BEHIND OTHERS
BOOKS ARE THE APOLOGIA FOR A SELF-INTERESTED AND WAY OF LIFE

QUITE THE OPPOSITE I WOULD SAY BOOKS ARE WHY YOU DON'T NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR LIVING THAT WAY

I WISH ON REDDIN THERE WAS MORE OPENNESS TO ACTUALLY DISCUSSING PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS THEN JUST BASHING THEM AYN RAND IN PARTICULAR HAS SUFFERED VASTLY BECAUSE DECADES AFTER HER DEATH SHE WAS ADOPTED BY THE TEA PARTY EVEN THOUGH SHE DISAGREES WITH THEM ON A LITANY OF ISSUES NAMELY RELIGION ABORTION AND MILITARY INTERVENTION

I THINK LIKE MOST SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ITS INAPPROPRIATE TO SIMPLY RIDICULE IT BY SAYING IT ONLY APPEALS TO IDIOTS TEENAGERS OR PEOPLE SIMPLY LACKING INSIGHT I'VE ENJOYED AYN BOOKS AND I THINK THEY TOUCH ON A VERY SENSITIVE TOPIC PARTICULARLY IN SOCIETY LIVING FOR ONESELF INSTEAD OF THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS

THIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD BE A JERK TO EVERYONE NOR IS IT ADVOCATING TREATING OTHER PEOPLE POORLY INSTEAD THE IDEA IS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD FOCUS ON THINGS THAT GENUINELY IMPROVE THEIR LIVES WITHOUT WORRYING WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK IF YOU READ ANY OF HER BOOKS THE VILLAINOUS CHARACTERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE OBSESSED OTHER PEOPLES THOUGHTS OR OPINIONS THE HEROES ARE THE PEOPLE WHO MOVE AHEAD REGARDLESS OF WHAT SOCIETY TELLS THEM TO DO

IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY SIMPLE CONCEPT BUT ITS OFTEN FORGOTTEN IN A SOCIAL MEDIA DRIVEN WORLD WHERE PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN BY FACEBOOK LIKES AND PEETWEETS OBJECTIVISM ISN'T PUSHING FOR GREED IN A MALICIOUS WAY IT PUSHES FOR IT IN A WAY THAT URGES PEOPLE TO BE GREEDY FOR THEIR OWN LIVES AND TO MAKE DECISION THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM AND NOT OTHERS LIVE FOR YOURSELF IS NOT A AXIOM FOR CRUELTY AND GREED IT'S MEANT TO INSPIRE PEOPLE TO PUT THEIR OWN SELF INTERESTS ABOVE THE OPINIONS OF OTHERS

UNFORTUNATELY THESE THREADS ARE OFTEN CROWDED WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER EVEN BOTHERED TO READ HER BOOKS OR UNDERSTAND HER CHARACTERS BUT STILL FEEL COMFORTABLE DISMISSING THEM
VERSUS THE CLAIM THAT RAND HAD ONLY A DISTORTED UNDERSTANDING OF KANT HERE ARE A COUPLE OF AYN STATEMENTS ON KANT SHE QUOTES HIM IN THE FIRST ONE THOSE WHO REALLY KNOW PHILOSOPHY CAN JUDGE HER GRASP OF HIM ACCORDINGLY

THE OF DUTY IS IMMANUEL KANT HE WENT SO MUCH FARTHER THAN OTHER THEORISTS THAT THEY SEEM INNOCENTLY BENEVOLENT BY COMPARISON DUTY HE HOLDS IS THE ONLY STANDARD OF VIRTUE BUT VIRTUE IS NOT ITS OWN REWARD IF A REWARD IS INVOLVED IT IS NO LONGER VIRTUE THE ONLY MORAL MOTIVATION HE HOLDS IS DEVOTION TO DUTY FOR DUTY S SAKE ONLY AN ACTION MOTIVATED EXCLUSIVELY BY SUCH DEVOTION IS A MORAL ACTION I EAST AN ACTION PERFORMED WITHOUT ANY CONCERN FOR INCLINATION DESIRE OR SELF-INTEREST

IT IS A DUTY TO PRESERVE ONE S LIFE AND MOREOVER EVERYONE HAS A DIRECT INCLINATION TO DO SO BUT FOR THAT REASON THE OFTEN ANXIOUS CARE WHICH MOST MEN TAKE OF IT HAS NO INTRINSIC WORTH AND THE MAXIM OF DOING SO HAS NO MORAL IMPORT THEY PRESERVE THEIR LIVES ACCORDING TO DUTY BUT NOT FROM DUTY BUT IF ADVERSITIES AND HOPELESS SORROW COMPLETELY TAKE AWAY THE RELISH FOR LIFE IF AN UNFORTUNATE MAN STRONG IN SOUL IS INDIGNANT RATHER THAN DESPONDENT OR DEJECTED OVER HIS FATE AND WISHES FOR DEATH AND YET PRESERVES HIS LIFE WITHOUT LOVING IT AND FROM NEITHER INCLINATION NOR FEAR BUT FROM DUTY THEN HIS MAXIM HAS A MORAL IMPORT IMMANUEL KANT FOUNDATIONS OF THE METAPHYSICS OF MORALS EDWARD ROYAL PAGE WOLFF NEW YORK PP

AYN RAND UNDERSTANDS THAT TO DENY YOUR PERSONAL GOALS AND PERSONAL HAPPINESS AS YOUR MOTIVATION IN ORDER TO BE GUIDED BY SHEER DUTY IS THE HEIGHT OF SELFLESSNESS I EAST SELF-SACRIFICE SELF-ABNEGATION EFFECT SUFFERING FOR SAKE

IN A DEONTOLOGICAL THEORY ALL PERSONAL DESIRES ARE BANISHED FROM THE REALM OF MORALITY A PERSONAL DESIRE HAS NO MORAL SIGNIFICANCE BE IT A DESIRE TO CREATE OR A DESIRE TO KILL FOR EXAMPLE IF A MAN IS NOT SUPPORTING HIS LIFE FROM DUTY SUCH A MORALITY MAKES NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUPPORTING IT BY HONEST LABOR OR BY ROBBERY IF A MAN WANTS TO BE HONEST HE DESERVES NO MORAL CREDIT AS KANT WOULD PUT IT SUCH HONESTY IS PRAISEWORTHY BUT WITHOUT MORAL IMPORT ONLY A VICIOUS REPRESSER WHO FEELS A PROFOUND DESIRE TO LIE CHEAT AND STEAL BUT FORCES HIMSELF TO ACT HONESTLY FOR THE SAKE OF DUTY WOULD RECEIVE A RECOGNITION OF MORAL WORTH FROM KANT AND HIS ILK

THIS IS THE SORT OF THEORY THAT GIVES MORALITY A BAD NAME

AYN FOREMOST PHD IN PHILOSOPHY NAMED LEONARD THIS

IN THEORY KANT STATES A MAN DESERVES MORAL CREDIT FOR AN ACTION DONE FROM DUTY EVEN IF HIS INCLINATIONS ALSO FAVOR IT BUT ONLY INSOFAR AS THE LATTER ARE INCIDENTAL AND PLAY NO ROLE IN HIS MOTIVATION BUT IN PRACTICE KANT MAINTAINS WHENEVER THE TWO COINCIDE NO ONE CAN KNOW THAT HE HAS ESCAPED THE INFLUENCE OF INCLINATION FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES THEREFORE A MORAL MAN MUST HAVE NO PRIVATE STAKE IN THE OUTCOME OF HIS ACTIONS NO PERSONAL MOTIVE NO EXPECTATION OF PROFIT OR GAIN OF ANY KIND

EVEN THEN HOWEVER HE CANNOT BE SURE THAT NO FRAGMENT OF DESIRE IS SECRETLY MOVING HIM THE FAR CLEARER CASE THE ONE CASE IN WHICH A MAN CAN AT LEAST COME CLOSE TO KNOWING THAT HE IS MORAL OCCURS WHEN THE MAN S DESIRES CLASH WITH HIS DUTY AND HE ACTS IN DEFIANCE OF HIS DESIRES

IS THIS NOT CLEAR FROM THE SELECTION FROM KANT THAT AYN RAND QUOTED ABOVE IS THERE A QUOTE FROM KANT THAT REFUTES IT

YES AT FIRST I WAS EXCITED ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO READ
I THOUGHT I WAS A REPUBLICAN UNTIL I DISCOVERED AYN RAND I'VE NEVER READ ATLAS SHRUGGED OR ANY OF HER MORE PROMINENT WORKS I RAN ACROSS PHILOSOPHY WHO NEEDS IT BY SHEER CHANCE AND IT ARTICULATED WHAT I ALREADY WAS MY BEST EXPERIENCES OF AWAKENING HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY DISCOVERING IDEAS WHICH GAVE DEFINITION TO HIDDEN THOUGHTS

FOR ME OBJECTIVISM DIDN'T SIGNIFY A WAY OF LIFE OR SOCIAL OR POLITICAL GOALS DESPITE BEING NOTHING LIKE RAND AS A PERSON OR PERSONALITY SHE SEES THE WORLD IN A SPECIFIC WAY THAT I SHARE LEFTISTS AND RIGHTISTS DON'T EVEN TRY TO BE OBJECTIVE WHEREAS AN OBJECTIVIST IS SOMEONE WHO STRIVES DESPITE THAT THEY WILL FAIL SINCE OBJECTIVITY IS RENDERED ALMOST MOOT GIVEN THE ARCHAIC COGNITIVE TOOLS OUR SPECIES INHERITED

I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF ANDIAN ANY LONGER NOR AN OBJECTIVIST I WAS NEVER ONE WHO ADVERTISED IT BUT THERE IS AN ESSENCE TO THAT WORLD-VIEW THAT IS WHAT I AM I IMAGINE MANY LEFTISTS WHO HAD A SIMILAR RESPONSE WITH THE WORKS OF MARX AND I KNOW MANY OF THEM HAVE DEPARTED AS STRICT ADHERENTS TO HIS PHILOSOPHIES ONCE THEY'VE EXHAUSTED THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING THE GOOD INTO THEIR OWN SCHEMA AND DISPENSING WITH THE BAD THAT IS THE BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT FOR A CRITICAL THINKER

PEOPLE HARP ON THE ENEMIES OF THEIR OWN PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THERE'S SOMETHING TO IT

I READ ATLAS SHRUGGED AND DON'T GET THE HYPE 2 DIMENSIONAL BEAUTIFUL RICH PEOPLE UP AGAINST UGLY GOVERNMENT CARICATURES ALL WRAPPED UP WITH A MASTURBATORY PAGE RANT ABOUT TAKING YOUR BALL AND GOING HOME INDIVIDUALISM IS ONE THING BUT RAND SEEMS TO ADVOCATE A TOTAL LACK OF EMPATHY AND HUMAN DECENCY IN THE NAME OF PROFITS
AT MY HIGH SCHOOL WE HAD A FREE READING SESSION FOR THE FIRST MINUTES OF ENGLISH CLASSICAL I BROUGHT THE FOUNTAINHEAD AND REMEMBER MY TEACHER SAW MY BOOK AND STARTED CRITICIZING IT BEFORE I HAD EVEN GOTTEN THROUGH THE FIRST CHAPTER AS A TEENAGER COMING TO TERMS WITH ALL THE FALSEHOODS IN SOCIETY WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME ABOUT THE FOUNTAINHEAD WASN'T SO MUCH THE PUSH FOR INDIVIDUAL SELF-INTEREST BUT THE OPPRESSIVENESS OF CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IT'S BEEN MORE THAN YEARS SINCE I READ THE BOOK BUT I ALWAYS ENJOYED IT AND APPRECIATE IT FOR OPENING MY EYES AND PRESENTING A FRESH AND POWERFUL PHILOSOPHY TO ME AT THAT EARLY AGE

YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AT THAT TIME WE WERE FORCE FED SHAKESPEARE MAYBE SOME FOLIO SCOTT FITZGERALD BUT NEVER ANYTHING PHILOSOPHICAL OR CRITICAL OF SOCIETY THE ONLY TASTE OF PHILOSOPHY I HAD UP TO THAT POINT WAS REPUBLIC WHICH WAS THE PREVIOUS FREE READING BOOK I BROUGHT THAT WAS A SNOOZER

AS I'VE GOTTEN OLDER I'VE DEFINITELY HAD A PHILOSOPHICAL SHIFT TOWARDS COLLECTIVISM WHILE STILL RECOGNIZING VALIDITY IN MUCH OF OBJECTIVISM ALL THE STUDIED PHILOSOPHERS MIGHT CRUCIFY ME HERE BUT IT SEEMS LIKE PHILOSOPHY IS MAINLY CRITIQUED FOR ITS LOGICAL CONSISTENCY THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY WESTERN APPROACH THAT FOCUSES MORE ON PRECISION THAN ON A GENERAL CONCEPTS AND INTUITION I GET THAT APPROACH BUT I ALSO THINK IT HAS ITS LIMITATIONS FOR EXAMPLE DESPITE THE CRITICISMS IN THE VIDEO OBJECTIVISM IS NEVER REALLY SUBSTANTIVELY ADDRESSED PERSONALLY I THINK THERE ARE MANY WORTHWHILE CONCEPTS BUT A MORE INTERESTING EXAMINATION WOULD BE HOW THEY JIVE WITH ACTUAL HUMAN NATURE AND LARGER SOCIETY
I READ AYN RAND AND GOT SOMETHING OUT OF IT AND THE PHILOSOPHY WAS PERCOLATING A BIT THEN I TALKED TO SOMEONE ABOUT IT AND THEY POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS NO PLACE FOR CHILDREN IN HER WORLD THERE WOULD LITERALLY BE NO REASON TO HAVE THEM OR RAISE THEM IT SNAPPED ME OUT OF ANY FURTHER INTEREST IN AYN RAND
LOVED THE BOOK WHEN I WAS ABOUT YEARS OLD I THOUGHT I KNEW EVERYTHING I THOUGHT I WAS ONE OF THE ELITE ONES SHE WAS DESCRIBING I WAS THEN I MOVED ON
I WONDER HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE READ WE THE LIVING IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND RAND MAYBE YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE CAME FROM AND WHAT SHE WAS AGAINST

WE THE LIVING IS THE DEBUT NOVEL OF THE RUSSIAN AMERICAN NOVELIST AYN RAND IT IS A STORY OF LIFE IN POST-REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA AND WAS FIRST STATEMENT AGAINST COMMUNISM RAND OBSERVES IN THE FOREWORD THAT WE THE LIVING WAS THE CLOSEST SHE WOULD EVER COME TO WRITING AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY

THE STORY TAKES PLACE FROM TO IN POST-REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA KIRA ARGOUNOVA THE PROTAGONIST OF THE STORY IS THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER OF A BOURGEOIS FAMILY FATHER HAD BEEN THE OWNER OF A TEXTILE FACTORY WHICH WAS SEIZED AND NATIONALIZED HAVING GIVEN UP ALL HOPES OF REGAINING THEIR PAST POSSESSIONS AFTER THE VICTORIES OF THE RED ARMY THE FAMILY RETURNS TO THE CITY IN SEARCH OF LIVELIHOOD THEY FIND THAT THEIR HOME HAS ALSO BEEN SEIZED AND CONVERTED TO LIVING QUARTERS FOR SEVERAL FAMILIES

MAYBE SHE REALLY DID THINK THAT ALTRUISM WAS AMORAL BUT I DIDN'T GET THAT FROM WHAT I READ I THOUGHT THAT FORCED ALTRUISM WAS WHAT SHE WAS AGAINST AFTER GROWING UP IN RUSSIA AND SEEING FIRST HAND THE SOVIET COMMUNIST REVOLUTION IT SEEMS RATHER NORMAL TO HAVE SUCH A STRONG REACTION AGAINST GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION INTO BUSINESS AND SOCIETY AS A PHILOSOPHY HER WORK MAY BE SHIT I NEVER CARED ABOUT THAT ANYWAY AS A STATEMENT AGAINST COMMUNISM AND THE CREEPING OF GOVERNMENT IN TO ASPECTS OF BUSINESS AND PRIVATE LIFE I THINK RAND HAD A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT HER NOVELS WERE HEAVY HANDED AND HER DIALOGUE ESPECIALLY RADIO SPEECH WAS CRINGE WORTHY BUT THE IDEAS WERE INTERESTING

BUT HEY I COULD JUST BE AN IMMATURE TEENAGER OR SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS FIGURED IT WAS BASHED BECAUSE IT IS STRAIGHTFORWARD UNINDULGENT AND JUDGMENTAL MUCH OF PHILOSOPHY IS JUST VIRTUE SIGNALLING AND YOU CAN'T ACCOMPLISH THAT WITH SUCH A LACK OF OBSCURANTISM PLUS IT ISN'T MORALLY RELATIVISTIC WHICH VIRTUE SIGNALERS ALSO IRONICALLY DESPISE I'M NOT SAYING I AGREE WITH IT ENTIRELY BUT IT SURE IS BETTER THAN A LOT OF THE SHIT PEOPLE LOOK AWESOME FOR NAME DROPPING THESE DAYS
FLOCK OF SEAGULLS ROCKED DUDE
IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AS I HAVE EXPLORED PHILOSOPHY MORE DEEPLY THAT RAND IS SOMETHING OF A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO PHILOSOPHICAL WORLD VIEWS HER WORKS ARE NOT THE ONLY PLACE TO START BUT THEY'RE A DECENT PLACE AMONG SEVERAL OTHER OPTIONS

NOTE THAT THIS OBSERVATION IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE BELIEFS RAND SPECIFICALLY ESPOUSES INSTEAD IT IS DEPENDENT ON THEIR RELATIVE SIMPLICITY A RELATIVELY SIMPLISTIC PHILOSOPHICAL WORLD-VIEW IS FINE WE ALL HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE THE PROBLEM AGAIN IN MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT MANY PEOPLE VIEW HER AS THE ENDPOINT RATHER THAN THE STARTING POINT

AS AN ANALOGY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ENJOYING WEB AS YOUR FAVORITE BOOK GROWING UP IT'S AN EXCELLENT BOOK TO START UNDERSTANDING HOW STORY WRITING WORKS AND HOW UNSTATED THEMES CAN BE EXPLORED THROUGH THIS PROCESS IN FACT I'D EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THIS IS GREAT BUT IMAGINE IF SOMEONE NEVER GOT PAST WEB AND CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS THE ULTIMATE NOVEL THE ZENITH OF HUMAN STORY TELLING AND THEMATIC EXPRESSION THAT WEB DID NOT JUST BEGIN THE PROCESS OF EXPLORATION BUT ENDED IT

THAT'S REALLY HOW I FEEL ABOUT AYN RAND SHE'S A PERFECTLY FINE PLACE TO START ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS BUT IT'S THE STARTING POINT IN ASKING QUESTIONS NOT THE END
RAND BASHING
SO JUST GO FOR THE OP PIPE WRENCH BUILD
REMOVED
RAND WAS A VERY SMART YET EXTREMELY SELF-CENTERED PERSON WHO BUILT AN ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY TO EXPLAIN AWAY WHAT SHE COULDN'T HANDLE IN HERSELF AND THE WORLD

MOST PHILOSOPHERS WESTERN AND EASTERN THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS THE PROBLEM IS SHE COULDN'T DISTINGUISH HER OWN PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES FROM THOSE THAT ARE TRULY UNIVERSAL

HER PHILOSOPHY WAS WELL RECEIVED BY GENERAL PUBLIC BECAUSE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE MODERN ERA SUFFER FROM THE SAME TROUBLING ISSUE NAMELY AND MAINLY HOW TO RECONCILE THE FACT THAT OUR MERE EXISTENCE AND THE EXISTENCE OF OUR MODERN INSTITUTES NATIONS RELIGIONS GOVERNMENTS CORPORATIONS ETC INEVITABLY CAUSES SUFFERING TO OTHER LIVING THINGS A GOOD EXAMPLE IS SUPPORT FOR KHMER ROUGE BY THE WEST DURING THE THEY HAVE DONE ATROCIOUS CRIMES YET SERVED A PURPOSE THAT BENEFITED PEOPLE IN THE WEST ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS SUPPORT FOR TERRIBLE REGIMES IN THE JUST TO SECURE ENERGY SUPPLIES INTO EUROPE WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD FALL INTO SOVIET HANDS ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS MODERN SLAVE LABOR USED BUILDING OUR SMART PHONES AND PROBABLY THE BEST AND MOST PREVALENT IS THE CRUELTY WE EXHIBIT TO FARM ANIMALS WE USE FOR OUR FOOD IT'S A TERRIBLE DISSONANCE ESPECIALLY FOR THE YOUNGER SOULS

SOME BECOME ACTIVISTS OR VEGAN BUT FOR A REALLY PERSON ACCUSTOMED TO EXPLAIN THINGS WITH HER BIG BRAIN LIKE RAND THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION WHICH IS TO MAKE UP STORIES THAT EXPLAIN IT AWAY

THAT'S WHAT RAND DID AND TOOK IT TO THE EXTREME BY SAYING THAT EVERYTHING WE DO THAT'S GOOD FOR US PERSONALLY WILL ALSO SOMEHOW BE GOOD FOR SOCIETY AND THE WORLD WHICH REALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT SHE MANAGED TO MAKE IT APPEAR LOGICAL AND BECAUSE IT'S SELF-SERVING A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY CHALLENGE HER ABOUT IT AND JUST ACCEPTED IT IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES

ALL VERY LOGICAL AND ALSO VERY WRONG NOT JUST BECAUSE THE LOGIC IS FAULTY IT IS BUT MAINLY BECAUSE SHE FAILED TO SEPARATE HER OWN PERSONAL ISSUES FROM HER SO CALLED PHILOSOPHY
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S MOSTLY PSYCHOLOGY AND NOT PHILOSOPHY AND THAT IS A GOOD REASON TO BASH HER IDEAS THE PHILOSOPHY NOT THE PERSON RAND WAS A SMART PROUD YET ALMOST TOTALLY DEVOID OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND THAT IS CLEARLY REFLECTED IN HER IDEAS

HAVING READ ATLAS SHRUGGED THE FOUNTAINHEAD TIMES EACH OVER THE LAST DECADE AND MOST OF THE REST OF HER CORPUS I FIND MYSELF TAKING AWAY LESS AND LESS EACH TIME FROM THE IDEAL OF AN IDEA WHICH AT FIRST GLANCE SEEMS SO BRIGHT UPON CLOSER AND REPEATED SCRUTINY IT HAS REVEALED ITSELF TO ME TO BE A MORE AND MORE AND INVERSELY MORE BRITTLE AT THIS POINT THE ONLY I HOLD ONTO IS THAT SHE TRIED TO CREATE A COMPLETE PHILOSOPHICAL PRODUCT BUT AS FOR THE CONTENT I LEFT THAT BEHIND
I'M ONLY PARTIALLY THROUGH THE VIDEO AND IT SEEMS INTERESTING BUT IMMEDIATELY I HAVE TO SAY WHEN YOU MAKE STATEMENT LIKE CAPITALISM CAN DO SOME COOL STUFF IT SORT OF INDICATES MAYBE YOUR BEEF WITH RAND DOESN'T REALLY REQUIRE AN ELABORATE EXPLANATION ANYONE WHO IS FORCED TO BEGRUDGINGLY ACCEPT THE VALUE OF CAPITALISM VERY CLEARLY BELONGS TO A TRIBE AND INTELLECTUAL TRIBALISM IS THE ABSOLUTE DEATH OF FREE THOUGHT
REMOVED
AS ONE WHO READ ATLAS SHRUGGED THE FOUNTAINHEAD AS WELL AS ANTHEM I ENJOYED ALL OF THOSE BOOKS AND WILL ADMIT HER IDEOLOGY DID APPEAL TO ME AT THAT TIME IN MY LIFE THE INFLUENCE OF HER WORK EVEN LED ME ASTRAY POLITICALLY LONGER AFTER IN ESSENCE GROWING OUT OF HER PHILOSOPHY

I FEEL THIS VIDEO MADE POINTS I WAS UNAWARE OF AS I STUCK TO ONLY READING HER FICTIONAL STORIES AND I WONDERED WHY PEOPLE BASHED HER SO OFTEN IT WAS MY BELIEF AT THAT TIME IT WAS HER UPBRINGING AS A CHILD IN RUSSIA AND THE EXPERIENCES OF AMERICA AFTERWARDS THAT MADE HER EXTREME POINT OF VIEW A REALITY

WITH ALL OF THIS SAID I AM GLAD I READ HER BOOK BUT DON'T MISTAKE THIS AS A BADGE OF HONOR READING AYN RAND IS LIKE EXPLAINING TO SOMEONE HOW I GOT A SCAR IT WOULDN'T BE A STORY OF A WARZONE FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT MORE LIKELY I CUT MYSELF ACCIDENTALLY WHILE MAKING DINNER

SO SIMILAR TO CUTTING ONESELF ON ACCIDENT I FEEL WISER FOR IT NOT BECAUSE SHE HERSELF CONTAINED WISDOM HOWEVER SHE OFFERED ME PERSPECTIVE TO SEE THE WORLD IN A MANNER MOST CANNOT NOR COMPREHEND I MEAN SERIOUSLY THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS OUR INSTINCT IS TO SCOFF AT SUCH NONSENSE BUT EVEN NOW WHEN I TAKE A STEP BACK I'M IMPRESSED SHE EXPANDED MY WORLD EVEN IF THAT WORLD IS FALSE WHEN FACING REALITY

OF COURSE THE COUNTER ARGUMENT WOULD BE WHO NEEDS FALSE PROPHETS DO WE REALLY WANT PEOPLE SPREADING BELIEFS THAT PERHAPS WE FEEL IS A STEP BACKWARDS OF COURSE NOT I FEEL FEW CAN ITS OUR INSTINCT TO FIGHT IT AND PRESERVE OUR WORLD USUALLY WITH LITTLE TO NO QUESTION IF WE ARE IN THE WRONG

SO TO CLOSE UP MY POINT WOULD I RECOMMEND READING AYN RAND TO ANYONE OF COURSE NOT BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND WATCHING THE MOVIE THE FOUNTAINHEAD BECAUSE I LOVE A GOOD BACK AND WHITE MOVIE OH AND IT'S WORTH SEEING SOMEONES FACE WHEN THEY SEE A MAN ADMIT THEY ARE GUILTY AND GET OFF INNOCENT ONLY IN HOLLYWOOD
REMOVED
COMPROMISE ON RIGHT AND WRONG ISN'T A VIRTUE AND THE ONLY WAY TO SEE IT AS ONE IS TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE IDEA OF MORAL RELATIVISM AND TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF MORAL ABSOLUTES
REMOVED
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHICH PUBLIC SCHOOLS ASSUMING HE IS NOT TALKING ABOUT COLLEGES THAT REQUIRES AYN RAND NOVELS
GIVEN THE FACT THAT RAND WAS AN OUTSPOKEN IT'S NOT LIKELY THAT HER VIEWS WERE ATTACKED BECAUSE SHE WAS A WOMAN
I'VE NEVER PUT ANY STOCK INTO MORAL RELATIVISM SOME THINGS ARE OBJECTIVELY IMMORAL RAPE MURDER THE HOLOCAUST AND MORAL RELATIVISM COULD BE USED TO JUSTIFY ANYTHING

REFUSING TO COMPROMISE ON SOMETHING OBJECTIVELY IMMORAL IS OF COURSE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD BAD THAT'S WHY THE DISCERNMENT BETWEEN THE MORAL AND THE IMMORAL IS SO IMPORTANT
AYN RAND SAID THAT MUSIC WAS OBJECTIVELY SUPERIOR TO
REMOVED
I THINK RANDS CLAIMS ABOUT ALTRUISM KINDNESS ETC JUST HAVEN'T KEPT PACE WITH OUR SCIENTIFIC PICTURE OF HUMAN NATURE THE DESIRE TO DEFEND AND NURTURE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY IS A DEEP PSYCHOLOGICAL NEED AND BEING NICE REALLY DID ENABLE US TO SURVIVE OUR PAST


I THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO ESPOUSE A TOUGH COLD VIEW OF THE WORLD ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO CRITICISM WHEN THEY ARE WRONG IF YOU HAVE DISCOVERED HARSH TRUTHS HARSHNESS IS WARRANTED BUT WHEN IT TURNS OUT THAT YOUR HARSHNESS IS BASED ON IGNORANCE I CAN'T HELP BUT DESPISE YOU


I THINK EVERYONE WHO LIKES RAND SHOULD TAKE A MOMENT AND WATCH SOME VIDEO OF HERALDRY SHE IS VISIBLY JAMMED WITH DEXEDRINE CHAIN-SMOKE SPEAKS IN NASTY LITTLE BURSTS OF WIT AND SCOWLS AT EVERYTHING THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT HER PARTICULAR WORLD-VIEW


ADMIRE HER IF YOU'D LIKE BUT YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE HERALDRY GET ON YOUTUBE AND SEE WHAT YOU BECOME WHEN YOU DIRECT ALL YOUR ENERGIES INTO A NARROW INTELLECTUAL ATTACK ON THE POSSIBILITY OF GRACE OH AND DON'T GET TOO INTO CATS SHE LOVED CATS


EDIT WORD REDITION IN 1ST PARAGRAPH SORRY MOBILE





DID SHE RIGHT BRAVE NEW WORLD I KNOW I COULD EASILY FOND OUT BY CHECKING GOOGLE BUT I LOVED THAT BOOK AND SECRETLY WANTED TO START A DISCUSSION

REMOVED
IT'S BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T OFFER ANY PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS JUST NOVELS WITH CHARACTERS


WAIT THERE ACTUALLY HAD TO BE A POST MADE ON REDDIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT PEOPLE WITH COMMON SENSE ALREADY UNDERSTAND

VERY INTERESTING THANKS FOR SHARING ITS PRETTY MISERABLE IN THE MIDDLE AREAS THE PULL BACK TO THE LAL S IS VERY STRONG THIS MAKES ME THINK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO SEEK STRONGLY SELF DESTRUCTIVE PATHS OF ADDICTION OR GAMBLING I WONDER WHAT LEVEL DABROWSKI WOULD FEEL THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE ON THEY CHOOSE TO DISREGARD SOCIAL NORMS YET THEY ARE OFTEN CONTROLLED BY SUBSTANCE OR OTHER ADDICTION
I'LL QUICKLY NOTE THAT SINGER SEEMS TO BE USING SOMETHING ANALOGOUS TO UTILITARIANISM IN THAT IT'S LOOKING AT OUTCOMES IMPERSONALLY AN ETHICS BASED ON EMPATHY ALONE MIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S HARDER TO EMPATHIZE WITH PEOPLE YOU WILL NEVER SEE AND BE MORE UNDERSTANDING IF YOU DON'T ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT ARE DISTANT FOR YOU

THIS ANALYSIS OF JESUS TEACHINGS ON WEALTH AND CHARITY RUN QUITE CONTRARY TO POPULAR CHRISTIAN BELIEFS AT LEAST IN MUCH OF THE US WHEREIN WEALTH IS CONSIDERED A SIGN OF GOD'S BLESSINGS MY FATHER WHEN I WAS YOUNG WANTED ME TO READ A SERMON CALLED OF DIAMONDS WHEN I FINALLY GOT AROUND TO IT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S MAINLY A DEFENSE OF BEING RICH AS A CHRISTIAN

IN THIS ARTICLE THE AUTHOR USES THE TERMS AND FREQUENTLY THIS IS PERHAPS AN INDICATION THAT IT'S OKAY TO DEAL WITH YOUR OWN NECK OF THE WOODS FIRST

I ALSO APPRECIATE THE POINT ABOUT ENDURANCE IN CHARITY IT ECHOES WHAT I'VE HEARD SOME OTHERS SAY ABOUT THEIR OWN WORK IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR EVEN SO THE AUTHOR'S RECOMMENDED POINT OF CHARITY WOULD BE MUCH CLOSER TO EXTREME ALTRUISM THAN OCCASIONAL TITHINGS FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT
I THINK THE POINT THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA FOLLOW JESUS RELIGIOUSLY YOU OUGHT TO GIVE UNTIL GIVING MORE WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE IS ONE CHRISTIAN AMERICA REALLY NEEDS TO HEAR
THAT WAS A GOOD READ I AGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD HELP OTHERS I PREFER TO THINK IT'S HAVING A BALANCE BETWEEN LIVING AND LUXURY WHICH TOUCHES ON BEING A STEWARD OF WHAT YOU OWN I WAS ONCE TOLD THAT AFFLUENCE IN SOCIETY DOES EQUATE TO SOME FORM OF INFLUENCE AND WHETHER YOU GIVE IT ALL AWAY OR GAIN INFLUENCE TO INFLUENCE SOCIETY TO CHANGE BOILS DOWN TO HOW STEWARD WHAT YOU OWN
NICELY WRITTEN

THERE IS A BIT OF AN AGRICULTURAL THEME WHICH MAY NOT BE AS RELEVANT IN URBAN CIRCLES THE JESUS EQUATION IS NOT DOING AS WELL AGAINST THE FORCES OF CORPORATISM AND CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN TIME WHEN MONEY GOES UP AND TIME GOES DOWN THE POOR ARE LEFT OUT
GOOD ARTICLE
DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS IS COMMON IN MOST CULTURES AND IS CERTAINLY CENTRAL TO WESTERN INTELLECTUAL AND RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS SO THE IDEA OF A IS VERY UNSETTLING TO MANY PEOPLE

THAT'S FUNNY I KNEW ABOUT THESE EXPERIMENTS BUT I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THEM THAT WAY I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF CHIMERAS AS THEIR OWN DISTINCT GROUP NEITHER EQUAL TO HUMANS NOR ANIMALS AN ENGINEERED CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS CREATED FOR OUR OWN BENEFIT THEIR LIFE BEING OWED TO OUR NEED FOR GROWN TISSUE AND NOTHING MORE AT LEAST THEY HAVE A CLEAR AND DEFINED PURPOSE THOUGH A TRAGIC ONE PERSONALLY I'D RATHER THE TREATMENTS SIMPLY USED STEM CELLS ON THE PATIENTS THAT NEED THEM DIRECTLY INSTEAD OF NEEDING A MIDDLE ORGANISM
THE LAST SECTIONS OF THE ARTICLE TALK ABOUT HOW IF PEOPLE BEGIN TO CONSIDER ANIMAL AND HUMANS AS EQUALS THAT WE WILL TREAT OTHER HUMANS AS WE TREAT ANIMALS BUT WHY WOULD COULD IT NOT BE THE REVERSE AND WE TREAT ANIMALS AS WE TREAT HUMANS I EXPECT THIS IS THE VEGETARIAN VEGAN ANIMALRIGHTS VIEWPOINT WHERE THE VEGETARIAN VEGAN IS SUCH BECAUSE OF ANIMAL RIGHTS DISCLAIMER I'M NOT A VEGETARIAN OR VEGAN
I THINK SIMPLY STATING THE EUGENICS MOVEMENT BELIEVED THIS THUS IMPLYING BAD IS VERY SLOPPY THE EUGENICS MOVEMENT HAD SEVERAL PROBLEMS FAILING TO RESPECT AUTONOMY FAILING TO BE TRUTHFUL CAUSING PEOPLE TO NOT BE BORN ETC THE ISSUE BECOMES WAS FIDDLING WITH DNA ONE OF EUGENICS CRIMES

IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THE PUBLIC AT LARGE OFTEN DOESN'T UNDERSTAND BIOLOGY MUCH LESS WHAT IS AND ISN'T POSSIBLE BY CHANGING DNA AND AS SUCH THERE WOULD BE ISSUES OF COMPREHENSION INFORMED CONSENT ETC I DON'T THINK MUDDLING WITH DNA IS INHERENTLY EVIL

I THINK AN INJECTION WHICH INCREASED SPAN BY WOULD BE A WORTHWHILE INVENTION I THINK GROWING TRANSPLANTS CAN BE DONE IN AN ETHICAL WAY AND THERE ARE ALSO UNETHICAL WAYS GIVEN THAT THERE EXISTS SO MANY WAYS IN WHICH PLAYING WITH DNA IS POTENTIALLY AMAZING I THINK ITS A SHAME TO PUT ALL THAT POSSIBILITY IN A BOX AND CALL IT DEHUMANIZING AND BAD I ALMOST HATE INVOKING THIS WORD BUT BIOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE TO MAKE US MORE THAN WE CURRENTLY ARE YES THERE ARE A MILLION AND ONE WAYS IT CAN GO WRONG AND WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS AND CAREFUL BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO IT
YOU CAN'T ARGUE THAT TIME TRAVEL IS LOGICALLY CONSISTENT WITHOUT CORRECTLY REPRESENTING WHAT TIME IS

IF TIME TRAVEL WERE POSSIBLE ONE OF THREE SCENARIOS COME TO MIND FIRST OF ALL WE TRAVEL BACK INTO TIME ALL THE TIME WITHOUT THE NEED FOR TECHNOLOGY BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE WHEN WE TRAVEL BACK IN TIME WE HAVE MEMORIES FROM BACK THEN WE ARE WHERE WE WERE BACK THEN WE MAKE THE SAME DECISIONS AS WE DID ORIGINALLY AND EVERYTHING PLAYS OUT THE SAME

ALSO WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEAN TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME IF YOU TRAVEL BACK IN TIME WOULDN'T THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS IS YOU STEP OUT OF THE TIME MACHINE AND DEACTIVATE IT I MEAN IF TIME IS MOVING BACKWARDS WHY ARE YOU SEEING A FORWARD PASSING OF TIME AND THAT SAID WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEAN TIME IS MOVING BACKWARDS THAT'S LIKE SAYING LENGTH IS SHORTENING

SECONDLY IF WE COULD TRAVEL BACK IN TIME THERE'S A BUNCH OF WAYS THIS VIOLATES CAUSALITY I'LL JUST START TO USE THE OWN EXAMPLE IN THE EXAMPLE ONE MUNDANE WAY THAT THE PROTAGONIST FAILED TO KILL HIS GRANDPA IS A DOG BARKING AT HIM HOWEVER IN THE PAST THE DOG DIDN'T SEE HIM THEREFORE IT'S A CONTRADICTION BY HIS OWN DEFINITION ANOTHER ONE IS THAT HE MISSED BUT THE BULLET WOULD HAVE COLLIDED SOMEWHERE BUT IT DIDN'T COLLIDE WITH ANYTHING IN THE PAST SO IT WAS A CONTRADICTION EVEN BEING ON TOP OF THE BUILDING BUT HE WASN'T SO IT CONTRADICTS THE STORY

IN FACT ANYTHING WHERE HE TRAVELS BACK INTO THE PAST IS AUTOMATICALLY A CONTRADICTION BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S OWN SET OF RULES IF HE TRAVELS BACK INTO THE PAST THEN HE WOULD HAVE HAD NOT BEEN IN THAT PLACE IN THE PAST BUT NOW HE IS THEREFORE IT IS A CONTRADICTION

FINALLY THE VIDEO ASSUMES THAT THERE IS A SINGLE TIMELINE AND THAT THE UNIVERSE IS DETERMINISTIC THAT UNLESS YOU HOP INTO A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE THERE IS ONLY ONE SINGLE TIMELINE AND TO MODIFY SOMETHING IN THE SINGULAR PAST OF THAT UNIVERSE YOU MODIFY THE FUTURE OF THAT SINGULAR UNIVERSE BUT OUR UNIVERSE IS NOT DETERMINISTIC AND THERE ARE COUNTLESS BITS OF OUR UNIVERSE THAT EXIST IN NO DETERMINATE STATE WHAT IF OUR UNIVERSE DOESN'T CONSIST OF A SINGLE TIMELINE WE HAVE A PARTICULAR STATE WITH AN UNCOUNTABLE NUMBER OF FUTURES YOU'RE NOT JUMPING INTO A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE YOU'RE JUST A DIFFERENT FUTURE THAT HAD ROOTS IN THE SAME PAST AND YOU'RE EXPLORING A DIFFERENT BRANCH OF THAT

I CAN'T SAY THAT THE ORIGINAL VIDEO IS LOGICALLY CONSISTENT LOGICALLY THE ONLY CONSISTENT OPTION FOR TIME TRAVEL THAT I SEE IS OPTION AND THAT IS THAT WHEN YOU TRAVEL BACK IN TIME YOU WOULDN'T HAVE MEMORY OF IT BECAUSE YOU'D BE BACK IN THE PAST BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY TRAVELED IN TIME AND EVENTS WOULD PLAY OUT THE SIMILARLY BUT YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW IT HAPPENED
SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO AGUSTIN AYO MIT EXPLAINS THE GRANDFATHER PARADOX ONE OF THE CLASSIC PARADOXES OF TIME TRAVEL

TIME TRAVEL IS NOT DEFINITIVELY RULED OUT BY PHYSICS AS I UNDERSTAND IT A CORRECTLY POSITIONED WORMHOLE FOR EXAMPLE COULD CONCEIVABLY ACT AS A CONDUIT TO A SPACETIME POSITION THAT IS IN THE SAME PLACE BUT A DIFFERENT TIME THE PROBLEM IS THE WORLD GETS REALLY WEIRD FOR TIME TRAVELERS BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME THINGS THEY CAN NOT DO THOUGH WE CAN'T SAY WHY PHYSICS DOES SEEM TO RULE OUT TIME TRAVELERS

HAVING ANY AFFECT ON PAST EVENTS THE PAST IS IMMUTABLE YOU CAN'T GO BACK IN TIME AND KILL GRANDPA OR HITLER

HAVING ANY AFFECT ON PAST EVENTS 2 YOU CAN NOT INTERCEPT ANY LIGHT WITH YOUR EYES SOUND WAVES WITH YOUR EARS OR TRACE CHEMICALS WITH YOUR OLFACTORY SENSES YOU CAN NOT INTERFERE WITH A SINGLE MOLECULE NECESSARY FOR DETERMINING A FUTURE STATE OF THE WORLD YOU CAN NOT CAST A SHADOW

COMMUNICATING ANY INFORMATION FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT WHATEVER MANAGES TO PASS THROUGH THE WORMHOLE CANNOT CARRY INFORMATION FASTER THAN IT WOULD TAKE LIGHT TO REACH THE SAME POINT IN SPACE

SO WHILE FTL TRAVEL IS NOT RULED OUT IT IS HARD TO CONCEIVE WHAT DIFFERENCE SUCH TRAVEL COULD MAKE TO HUMANS
WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT TIME EXISTS
WOULDN'T TIME TRAVEL BE PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO ENTROPY GOING BACK IN TIME WOULD DECREASE LOCAL ENTROPY WHICH WOULD VIOLATE THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
FAVOURITISM ˈFEɪV I RɪTɪZ I M NOUN
THE PRACTICE OF GIVING UNFAIR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO ONE PERSON OR GROUP AT THE EXPENSE OF ANOTHER

FAVORITISM IS BY DEFINITION BAD UNFAIR BUT THE ARTICLE IGNORES THE ACTUAL DEFINITION OF FAVORITISM AND GIVES IT A NEW ONE

FAVORITISM GIVING MORE THAN AN EVEN BREAK TO YOUR OWN KIND

WHERE YOUR OWN KIND MEANS

THE PEOPLE WHO LOOK OUT FOR YOU WHO HAVE YOUR BACK WHO SHARE YOUR HISTORY WHO STAND FOR THE SAME THINGS YOU DO WHY WOULD YOU NOT PREFER THEM TO STRANGERS

NOW FAVORITISM IS FAIR SINCE YOUR OWN KIND DESERVE TO BE FAVORED SHOCKINGLY WHEN YOU CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF A WORD YOU ALSO CHANGE HOW THEY WILL BE EMPLOYED WHETHER THEY'RE CONSIDERED BAD OR GOOD AND WHATNOT

THIS IS NOT PHILOSOPHY THIS IS WORDPLAY AND A WASTE OF TIME
THIS STANDARD EMPLOY A CALCULUS OF MERIT RATHER THAN A CALCULUS OF CONSANGUINITY ASKS YOU TO REGARD IDEOLOGICAL POLITICAL DIFFERENCES AS ARTICLES OF CLOTHING THEY ARE COSMETIC RATHER THAN ESSENTIAL THE PERSON IS WHAT HE IS APART FROM THEM AND IT IS THE PERSON RATHER THAN THE ACCIDENTS OF BIRTH OR BELIEF OR NATIONALITY WHO MERITS YOUR RESPECT

FAVORITISM GIVING MORE THAN AN EVEN BREAK TO YOUR OWN KIND IS NOT A DISTORTION OF JUDGMENT BUT THE BASIS OF JUDGMENT
I'VE SAT THROUGH LECTURES TOO AND I'M PRETTY SURE HE WOULDN'T SAY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS HAS DOWNWARD CAUSATION SEARLE WOULD SAY THAT CONSCIOUSNESS HAS CAUSATION ON THE LEVEL OF HUMAN BEINGS ACTING NOT AT THE LEVEL OF CHEMICALS AND ELECTRONS BOUNCING AROUND IN THE BRAIN

KIND OF LIKE HOW ECONOMICS AND THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND HAVE CAUSAL POWER AT THE LEVEL OF GOODS LEAVING STORE SHELVES NOT AT THE LEVEL OF THE GLUONS AND QUARKS THAT MAKE UP THOSE GOODS YOU CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE GOODS DISAPPEARING FROM STORE SHELVES BY DESCRIBING IT AT THE LEVEL OF ECONOMICS OR BY DESCRIBING IT AT THE LEVEL OF QUARKS EMITTING GLUONS BACK AND FORTH THIS DOESN'T MAKE ECONOMICS EPIPHENOMENAL OR THAT THE LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND HAVE TRACTION IS AN ILLUSION
IT ALWAYS AMAZES ME THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL ARGUE THAT ARE CONCEIVABLE BUT THAT ACTUAL ZOMBIES WHICH IS TO SAY PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO BE IDENTICAL TO HUMANS PHYSICALLY BUT ARE NOT ALIVE ARE NOT
EVERY TIME I READ WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS IT FEELS LIKE I AM WATCHING THEM MASTERBATE

I AM NOT A PHILOSOPHER BUT I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE WORRYING ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS I HAVE NOTHING PROFOUND TO SAY I AM JUST SIMPLY IN AWE
GIVE ME A BLDR
CANADA CANADA CANADA

THOUGH AS I'VE SEEN A FEW PEOPLE COMMENT ELSEWHERE IT SEEMS A BIT STRANGE TO AWARD A MILLION DOLLAR CASH PRIZE TO SOMEONE AT THE END OF THEIR CAREER THERE'S AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT THIS KIND OF THING IS BETTER SERVED TO GIVE FUEL TO THE WORK OF SOMEONE WHO'S ALREADY SIGNIFICANT IN SOME WAY BUT COULD STILL POTENTIALLY MAKE EVEN GREATER FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS LIKE THE MACARTHUR GENIUS GRANT SEEMS TO BE USED FOR
CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN WHY HE MIGHT DESERVE THIS IS HE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PHILOSOPHER ALIVE TODAY
PART OF ME THINKS THE BERGGRUEN INSTITUTE IS TRY TO BY IT'S WAY TO LEGITIMACY AND VIABILITY THEIR FACEBOOK POSTS ARE A JOKE FOR INSTANCE NO LEGIT ORGANIZATION WOULD ALLOW THEM
THIS IS A PRETTY NARROW VIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD POPPER HIMSELF HAD MOVED ON FROM NARROW FALSIFICATIONISM LATER IN HIS OWN CAREER IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY AND NOT ALL SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES STRUCTURE THEIR INQUIRY AROUND THE CONSTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF NULL HYPOTHESES

I PERSONALLY PREFER THE BROADER DEFINITION OF SCIENCE PROPOSED BY DAVID DEUTSCH WHICH IS THAT SCIENCE IS AT BOTTOM THE BUSINESS OF EXPLANATION BY THIS DEUTSCH MEANS IT IS AN EPISTEMOLOGY I EAST ENTERPRISE WHOSE PRIMARY METRIC IS PARSIMONY

MORE SPECIFICALLY SCIENCE IS ABOUT PRODUCING MAXIMALLY PARSIMONIOUS I EAST SIMPLE BUT COMPREHENSIVE OR ELEGANT EXPLANATIONS OF OBSERVATIONS THE OBSERVATION COMPONENT MAKES SCIENCE EMPIRICAL BUT DEUTSCH GOES TO GREAT LENGTH INSISTING THAT EXPLANATION IS WHAT IS FUNDAMENTAL NOT EMPIRICISM

EDIT IT'S WORTH ADDING THAT DEUTSCH OPERATIONALIZES A GOOD EXPLANATION AS ONE THAT CANNOT BE EASILY VARIED FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUR EXPLANATION OF WHERE THUNDER COMES FROM IS A GOD WHO LIVES IN THE SKY WELL THAT CAN BE EASILY VARIED TO A GOD WHO LIVES IN MY GARDEN ETC BUT THE ACTUAL EXPLANATION CAN'T VARY MUCH AT ALL OR IT STOPS WORKING

IT'S A FASCINATING AND COMPELLING VIEW OF SCIENCE AND WELL WORTH CHECKING OUT
WHAT NOT EVEN A MENTION FOR KUHN IN THE END EVEN POPPER DIDN'T ACCEPT THE NAIVE FALSIFICATIONISM WHICH THIS VIDEO PUTS FORWARD
I PREFER THE EPISTEMOLOGICALLY ANARCHICAL MUSINGS OF ONE PAUL FEYERABEND IN HIS AGAINST METHOD
EXCEPT NO DISCUSSION OF QUINE OR DIRHEM

I WAS A BIG ADVOCATE OF FALSIFICATION UNTIL I READ THEIR WORK WHICH TO ME IS A COMPLETE TAKEDOWN

BASICALLY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THEY ARGUE

THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TEST A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS IN ISOLATION BECAUSE AN EMPIRICAL TEST OF THE HYPOTHESIS REQUIRES ONE OR MORE BACKGROUND ASSUMPTIONS

FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU SEE A BLACK SWAN HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S A BLACK SWAN AND WHAT EXACTLY ENTAILS A BLACK SWAN IS A SWAN COVERED IN DIRT THAT LOOKS BLACK A BLACK SWAN HOW DO WE KNOW THAT OUR OBSERVATION IS ACCURATE ETC
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD THAT HAS BECOME CANONICAL IN CLASSROOMS AT LEAST AMERICAN CLASSROOMS DOES NOT CAPTURE THE ESSENCE OF SCIENCE BUT IS THE RESULT OF A HISTORICALLY CONTINGENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN EARLY CENTURY AMERICA JOHN EPISTEMOLOGY FOR THE MASSES HISTORY OF EDUCATION QUARTERLY FALL DOES A GREAT JOB OF EXPLAINING HOW THE STEP METHOD ROSE TO PROMINENCE AND DESPITE STRONG CRITICISM FROM SCIENTISTS SURVIVED TO DEFINE SCIENCE FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN STUDENTS
YES THE STEP METHOD CAPTURES A COOKBOOK APPROACH THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO SOME SCIENCES BUT METHODOLOGIES IN MANY SCIENCES SIMPLY CAN'T BE CAPTURED WITH IT IT CREATES A DISTORTED VIEW OF WHAT SCIENCE IS AND HOW IT OPERATES I DON'T THINK IT'S COINCIDENCE THAT THE TWO MOST CONTROVERSIAL AREAS OF SCIENCE IN AMERICA ARE CLIMATE CHANGE AND EVOLUTION THESE ARE NOT FIELDS THAT CAN BE STUDIED EFFECTIVELY WITH THE STEP METHOD AND I SUSPECT THAT STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY SOPHISTICATED UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES TO APPROACH THESE TOPICS IN A USEFUL MANNER
THAT'S NOT REALLY PROBLEM OF INDUCTION

THE BLACK SWAN PROBLEM SIMPLY DEMONSTRATES THAT NO GENERAL CONCLUSION OF AN INDUCTION WILL BE CERTAIN SINCE AN INDUCTIVE ARGUMENT IS BASED ON A FINITE SET OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS CONTRADICTING EVIDENCE SOMEWHERE ACCORDING TO THE HUMEAN PROBLEM OF INDUCTION NO INDUCTION HAS ANY JUSTIFICATION WHATSOEVER VERY BRIEFLY THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO JUSTIFY THE UNIFORMITY OF THE FUTURE WILL BE LIKE THE PAST CIRCULAR THE POINT IS THAT THESE ARE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THAT INDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS CAN'T SUPPORT CERTAIN UNIVERSAL CONCLUSIONS INNOVATION WAS TO CLAIM THAT THEY DON'T OFFER ANY DEGREE OF SUPPORT MOREOVER THIS IS THE PROBLEM TO WHICH POPPER WAS RESPONDING HE RESPONDS NOT BY RESOLVING THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION BUT BY SAYING THAT WE NEEDN'T WORRY SCIENCE PROCEEDS THAT IS WE POSTULATE HYPOTHESES AND DEDUCE TESTABLE CONSEQUENCES FROM THEM NO INDUCTION NECESSARY

ALSO LOL AT CALLING HUME A MATHEMATICIAN THAT GUY DID NOT LIKE MATHEMATICS
YA SCIENTIFIC METHOD

BUT ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS THE WAY THAT POPULAR CULTURE AND CORPORATE INTERESTS VIEW SCIENCE PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAY THAT SCIENCE SHOWS THAT GLYPHOSATE IS SAFE SCIENTISTS ARE PAID TO SHOW THAT GLYPHOSATE IS NOT HARMFUL AND ONE WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO COME UP WITH A EXCEPT THAT REQUIRES CREATING A MEASUREMENT FOR HARM THAT WILL PROVE THE

THE EASIEST MEASUREMENT THAT WE HAVE FOR HARM IS A SIMPLE TOXICITY STUDY THAT STARTS WITH ASKING HOW MUCH OF A SUBSTANCE IS REQUIRED TO KILL HALF OF A POPULATION WHAT'S MUCH HARDER TO MEASURE IS HARM DONE OVER A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION A WIDE VARIETY OF INTERACTIONS WITH ALL KINDS OF OTHER ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN OUR SOILS OUR AIR AND OUR WATER AND IT'S EVEN HARDER TO MEASURE ARE THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH MONOCULTURE

SO THE RICH AND POWERFUL AND SOME SCIENTISTS SAY WE NEED BLACK SWAN EXAMPLE WHERE WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT GLYPHOSATE ISN'T SAFE AND THEY SET THAT BAR FOR THE REALLY HIGH SOME SCIENTISTS SAY THAT GLYPHOSATE HASN'T BEEN PROVEN TO BE HARMFUL AND MONSANTO SAYS THAT GLYPHOSATE IS SAFE

EVENTUALLY SCIENCE WILL FIGURE IT OUT BUT IN THE MEAN TIME

YA SCIENTIFIC METHOD

BUT WATCH OUT FOR ROGUE SCIENTISTS AND THEIR BENEFACTORS

REMOVED
WELL THAT IS DISAPPOINTING THE TOP RATED AND GOLD STARED COMMENTS IN THIS SUB ARE TALKING ABOUT THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF POST THE OP LITERALLY SAID THE ORIGINAL SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS A TRIED TESTED AND TRUE METHOD OF SCIENCE IN A WORLD WHERE CERTAIN MEDICAL DISCIPLINES DO NOT EVEN FOLLOW A BASIC SCIENTIFIC METHOD YET ARE STILL LEGALLY ALLOWED DO DIAGNOSE AND PRESCRIBE DRUGS WE REALLY NEED TO SIT BACK DOWN AND NOT ALLOW THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD TO BE FLEXIBLE IT EVOLVED TO ACCOMMODATE A CORRUPT INDUSTRY THIS IS WRONG
DELETED
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A RECENT ARTICLE THAT APPEARED ON THE FRONT PAGE A FEW DAYS AGO WHICH OUTLINES THE ABUSE OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN ACADEMIA DIDN'T HAVE MUCH SUCCESS FINDING THE LINK

JUST WANT TO INTRODUCE A THAT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD MAY LOOK GREAT IN THEORY BUT MAY NOT BE SO GREAT OR PRACTICED ACCURATELY IN PRACTICE
THERE IS THE GUY THAT COMES AND SAYS
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS BLA BLA BLA VERY GOOD EXPLANATION BUT HAD DISCOVERED NOTHING AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT SOME NEW STUFF
AND THERE IS THE ONE THAT COMES AND SAYS
I DON'T KNOW I WILL TRY THIS TO SEE IF IT WORKS
OFTEN FAILS BUT DISCOVERS SMALL THINGS THAT ALL TOGETHER HELP SCIENCE TO EVOLVE
IS THE WORLD WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE CONCEPTS WE HAVE OF THE WORLD
WE LEARNED THIS IN 6TH GRADE SCIENCE AND I STILL USE IT TO THIS DAY MAINLY FOR SIMPLE THINGS LIKE WHAT'S WHAT'S HEALTHIEST AND SO ON

FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN RATIONALISM ON THE OTHER HAND I RECOMMEND YOU TO CHECK OUT PRAXEOLOGY THE AUSTRIAN METHOD BY HOPPE INTRODUCTION TO AUSTRIAN ECONOMICS

IT'S NOT SO MUCH ON THE AUSTRIAN METHODOLOGY EXCEPT AT THE END BUT MORE ON POPPER LOGICAL POSITIVISM AND RATIONALISM HE PRESENTS THE ACTUAL REBUTTAL ABOUT HALFWAY IN BEFORE THAT HE SHINES SOME LIGHT ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF LOGICAL POSITIVISM AND THE INTUITIVE FAULTINESS IN ITS EPISTEMOLOGY

WHY WASNT ISNT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD APPLIED TO CLIMATE CHANGE THEORY
MORALITY ISN'T REAL ALL ACTIONS ARE DONE IN SELF INTEREST OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR THEY ARE BEING MANIPULATED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL SOMETIMES THAT SELF INTEREST IS IMMEDIATE GAIN 2 ITS AN INDIRECT BENEFIT ITS AN INVESTMENT IN A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP

A TYPICAL MORAL ACTION IS GIVING MONEY TO THE POOR THIS IS SEEN AS AN IMMEDIATE LOSS SO IT SEEMS MORAL HOWEVER IF TOO DESPERATE THE POOR WOULD TURN VIOLENT AND PROBABLY ROB THE WEALTHY SO DONATING A LITTLE TO THE POOR PROVIDES AN INDIRECT BENEFIT BY DETERRING VIOLENCE AND IS ACTUALLY IN SELF INTEREST OF THE WEALTHY 2

A MORAL ACTION MAY BE HELPING YOUR NEIGHBOR YOU DONT KNOW WELL WITH SOMETHING BUT YOUD RATHER JUST WATCH TV WELL WE BENEFIT WHEN WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WE CAN TRUST AND WE BUILD IT BY SEEMINGLY DO THINGS FOR OTHERS THAT HAVE AN IMMEDIATE LOSS AS WE BUILD THAT TRUST WITH AN INVESTMENT WE CAN BENEFIT BY HAVING PEOPLE TO RELY ON IN THE FUTURE MAYBE WHEN WE ARE IN DESPERATE TIMES

WHY ACT MORAL REALLY MEANS WHY DO AN ACTION THAT DOESN'T PROVIDE IMMEDIATE GAIN THE REASON IS THAT IT SATISFIES 2 OR BUT IS STILL IN OUR SELF INTEREST WE SUBCONSCIOUSLY ARE DOING ALL THIS COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS BY HUMAN NATURE


ALL WE CAN DO IS OBSERVE THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE WORLD WE CAN DRAW SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT IS BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO OBJECTIVELY DRAW AN OUGHT CONCLUSION
SO HIS ANSWER IS ESSENTIALLY THAT IT IS UNKNOWABLE AND THAT THOSE WHO GET LOST IN INTROSPECTION OR WHO ENTERTAIN PHILOSOPHICAL NOTIONS AS SUCH MIGHT AT THE VERY LEAST FIND MEANING IN THE ETHICAL POINT OF VIEW NOT THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT MORE BUT I WAS EXPECTING MORE I SUPPOSE DEFINITIVE ARGUMENTS HAVE NEVER BEEN A PRODUCT NOR A BYPRODUCT OF PHILOSOPHY
I HAVEN'T READ THE PAPER BUT I THINK THE QUESTION OF WHY SHOULD I ACT MORALLY BETRAYS A CONFUSION ABOUT THE CONCEPTS INVOLVED MORAL ACTION IS ANALYTICALLY THE SORT OF ACTION I SHOULD DO YOU SHOULD ACT MORALLY BECAUSE THAT IS AT LEAST IN PART WHAT IT MEANS FOR AN ACTION TO BE MORAL

NOW YOU MIGHT SIMPLY ASK A DIFFERENT QUESTION WHY THINK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS MORAL AND IMMORAL BEHAVIOR BUT THEN ALL THE STANDARD REASONS IN FAVOUR OF MORAL REALISM APPLY
I THINK THE TERMINATOR MOVIES THE MATRIX AND COVERED THIS
ALL OF THESE ARGUMENTS WOULD ALSO APPLY TO HUMANS THE BRAIN IS COMPOSED OF NEURONS YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS SIGNIFIES IN SIMPLIFIED TERMS IS THAT ONCE WE BUILD A COMPUTER THAT SIMULATES THE BRAIN WHY CAN WE NOT SAY IT IS CONSCIOUS UNDERSTANDS OR HAS INTENTIONALITY

WELL ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH WOULD BE TO SAY A COMPUTER SIMULATING THE BRAIN WON'T ACTUALLY BE CAPABLE OF TRANSLATING CHINESE IE THAT IT'S MISSING A NECESSARY ELEMENT UNDERSTANDING AND SO WON'T ACTUALLY WORK TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK OF COURSE WE COULD ALSO SAY IT'S A RENDERING CONSCIOUSNESS PURELY EPIPHENOMENAL AND CAN ACCOMPLISH IT BUT WON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND BUT THE FORMER IS A POSSIBILITY AND WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SAY IT'S LACKING UNDERSTANDING I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE EXACTLY WHICH POSITION SEARLE THINKS IS THE CASE OR MAYBE HE'S JUST HEDGING HIS BETS BY NOT COMMITTING

IT CANNOT BE CONSCIOUS UNDERSTAND OR HAS INTENTIONALITY BECAUSE ALL THESE WORDS ARE DEFINED WITH THINGS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A MECHANICAL COMPUTER OR PROGRAMS

THIS SEEMS TO PRESUPPOSE THAT THE THING WE ARE INTERPRETING AS CONSCIOUSNESS INTRINSICALLY IS SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE POSSESSED BY MACHINES CARRYING OUT THE SAME OPERATIONS OUR BRAINS TO ARE YOU SURE THIS IS NOT JUST A FAILURE OF IMAGINATION AS TO WHAT IS POSSIBLE

EG TURNING TO THE CAN DOLPHINS PAINT YOU IDENTIFY STUFF LIKE HAVING HANDS AS BEING NECESSARY BUT THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE OUR NOTION OF PAINTING DOESN'T INTRINSICALLY REQUIRE HANDS A DOUBLE AMPUTEE WHO HOLDS THE BRUSH IN HIS TEETH IS I'D SAY STILL PAINTING LIKEWISE YOU ASSUME A DOLPHIN IS UNDER WATER BUT THAT'S CLEARLY NOT TRUE DOLPHINS ARE NOT UNDERWATER ALL THE TIME THEY CAN BE PARTIALLY ABOVE WATER INDEFINITELY THOSE FACTORS SEEM TO BE ALL THAT ARE NECESSARY TO LET DOLPHINS PAINT

COULDN'T YOU THEN BE JUST AS WRONG IN YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT COMPUTER'S CAN'T CREATE CONSCIOUS AWARENESS JUST AS PAINTING DOESN'T REQUIRE HANDS THOUGH ALMOST ALWAYS INVOLVES THEM IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE OUR NOTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS INTRINSICALLY REQUIRES MEAT BRAINS THE NOTION SEEMS TO BE MORE ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF SOMETHING EXPERIENCING THINGS HOW DO WE KNOW THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A COMPUTER I MEAN CONSCIOUSNESS SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING WE UNDERSTAND FAR LESS THAN WE DO PAINTING BUT YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT IT SEEMS A PRETTY STRONG CLAIM TO SAY THERE'S NO WAY COMPUTERS CAN DO IT GIVEN HOW LITTLE WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT WHAT CAUSES IT


NOW THE SAME CAN BE SAID ABOUT THE COMPUTER THAT SIMULATES THE BRAIN OR MIND IT CANNOT BE CONSCIOUS UNDERSTAND OR HAS INTENTIONALITY BECAUSE ALL THESE WORDS ARE DEFINED WITH THINGS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A MECHANICAL COMPUTER OR PROGRAMS

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THE BRAIN ISN'T ITSELF A COMPUTER
SPEAKING FROM MY OWN PERSPECTIVE AS IT IS THE ONLY ONE I HAVE EVER KNOWN THE ONLY FORM OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT I CAN BE SURE OF EXISTING IS MY OWN FOR ME TO CONCLUDE THAT ANOTHER HUMAN IS CONSCIOUS IN THE SAME WAY THAT I AM SIMPLY ON THE BASIS OF THEIR BEHAVIORS REQUIRES A DEGREE OF EPISTEMIC DISHONESTY THIS SAME EPISTEMIC DISHONESTY IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO CONCLUDE THAT A COMPUTER IS CONSCIOUS FUNDAMENTALLY CONSCIOUSNESSES IS SELF-AWARENESS AND UNLESS I AM ABLE TO TRANSFORM INTO THE COMPUTER ITSELF I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO KNOW IF IT IS AWARE

I THINK THE ONLY RATIONAL MEANS OF JUDGING WHETHER OR NOT A SYSTEM IS CONSCIOUS IS BY COMPARING ITS BEHAVIOR TO THE BEHAVIORAL COMPONENTS OF THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT WE CAN BE SURE IS TRULY CONSCIOUS NAMELY OUR OWN
THE CHINESE ROOM IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST REFUTED ARGUMENTS IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY OVERALL IT SEEMS THAT THE MOST SENSIBLE OPTION IS NOT TO ENGAGE WITH IT BUT TO JUST WALK PAST IT IGNORE IT AND MOVE ON TO MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD TREAT A STREET PREACHER

YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE NEEDS TO BE HANDS TO HOLD A BRUSH THERE NEEDS TO BE AIR TO DRY THE PAINTING AND A DOLPHIN IS UNDER WATER THUS WE CAN SAY WITH RELATIVE EASE THAT CLAIMING A DOLPHIN PAINTED MONA LISA IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE DONE

I THINK YOU'RE NOT MAKING ENOUGH OF AN IMAGINATION EFFORT DOLPHINS ARE CAPABLE OF SOME DEXTERITY WITH THEIR BEAK AND CHECK THIS OUT THERE'S NOTHING STOPPING A DOLPHIN FROM PAINTING THE MONA LISA SAVE FOR ARTISTIC ABILITY AND AN APPRECIATION FOR HIGH RENAISSANCE ARTICLE THE SAME APPLIES TO CONSCIOUSNESS AND COMPUTERS SURE THE COMPUTER CAN'T DO IT EXACTLY IN THE SAME WAY THAT A HUMAN DOES BUT MAYBE IT CAN DO SOMETHING THAT'S EQUIVALENT IN EVERY MEANINGFUL SENSE
SO YOU ARE CORRECT ABOUT THE LINGUISTIC ERROR ISSUE BUT NOT ENTIRELY IN THE RIGHT WAY THE PROBLEM HAS TO DO WITH THE MEANINGS OF UNDERSTANDING KNOWING CONSCIOUSNESS ETC ALL OF WHICH SHOULD PROBABLY BE WRITTEN SOUS MATURE UNDER ERASURE AS THEIR SIGNIFICATION IS NECESSARY TO THE CONVERSATION YET INADEQUATE AT THE SAME TIME HELL WE HAVEN'T EVEN SETTLED ON A MEANING OF KNOWLEDGE THANKS GETTER

HEGEL COMPARED UNDERSTANDING TO A TABLE OF CONTENTS IN THIS SENSE COMPUTERS DEFINITELY CAN AND DO UNDERSTAND THEY RUN ON LOGIC AND DATABASES UNDERSTANDING DOES NOT FURNISH CONTENT IT MERELY CONNECTS CONTENTION

OFTEN IN SCHOOL WE ARE TAUGHT TO AND LEARN TO UNDERSTAND NOT TO KNOW WE EVEN DO IT YET DO NOT KNOW IT

DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO FIND THE ANSWER

YES I TURN TO THE BACK OF THE BOOK

IN WHAT YEAR DID THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION BEGIN



YES THAT IS CORRECT DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THE REVOLUTION HAPPENED

BECAUSE THE BRITISH HEAVILY TAXED THE COLONIES AND DENIED THEM REPRESENTATION IN PARLIAMENT

YES DO YOU KNOW HOW THE COLONISTS FELT ABOUT THAT

NOPE NOT AT ALL

NOW WE CAN INFER BASED ON THE COLONIST'S ACTIONS THAT THEY DIDN'T ENJOY THE RULE OF KING GEORGE AND BECAUSE THEY WON AND WE ARE TAUGHT TO VALUE DEMOCRACY AND RESENT ROYALTY WE BELIEVE THE COLONISTS WERE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF JUSTICE BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE COLONISTS FELT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THEY WERE ANGRY AND POINT TO REASONS WHY BUT WE CAN ONLY KNOW HOW THEY FELT IF WE WERE THERE EXPERIENCING IT OR HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES

HERE WE START TO DEVELOP A PICTURE OF HOW TO BETTER DISTINGUISH BETWEEN UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE COMPUTERS BOOKS ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS AND PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING JUST NEEDS TO RETURN THE PROPER X WHEN GIVEN THE PROPER Y

BUT KNOWLEDGE SEEMS INTIMATELY TIED UP WITH EXPERIENCE YOU DON'T KNOW SOMETHING UNTIL YOU'VE EXPERIENCED IT YOURSELF AND WE WOULDN'T SAY THAT COMPUTERS OR ROCKS HAVE EXPERIENCES THUS NEITHER WOULD WE SAY THAT COMPUTERS CAN KNOW

NO EXPERIENCE NO KNOWLEDGE NO KNOWLEDGE NO CONSCIOUSNESS


READ CONGONI INTEGRATED INFORMATION THEORY

ARTICLE


IT MADE THINGS FALL IN TO PLACE FOR ME SINCE A HUGE BUNCH OF TRANSISTORS DOING LOTS AND LOTS OF MICRO OPERATIONS OVER TIME SPANS OF PICO SECONDS HAVE VERY LOW INTEGRATED INFORMATION THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE COMPUTER BASED AI EVEN ONE THAT PERFECTLY REPLICATES THE BEHAVIOR OF A HUMAN BRAIN LACKS OR HAD EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS OF CONSCIOUSNESS

AFTER READING AND UNDERSTANDING THIS THEORY I ALSO COULD MUCH BETTER GRASP COMPATIBILIST ARGUMENT
YOUR MISTAKE IS ASSUMING THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS SOLELY A HUMAN ANTHROPOMORPHIC ATTRIBUTE ANIMALS INCLUDING DOLPHINS HAVE SOME DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHEREAS IT IS GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT PLANTS DO NOT IF ALIEN BEINGS CAME TO EARTH BEGAN TALKING AND INTERACTING WITH US WE WOULD HAVE TO PRESUME THAT THEY HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE DEFINED AS HAVING AWARENESS OF ONE'S ENVIRONMENT AND ONE'S OWN EXISTENCE SENSATIONS AND THOUGHTS WE KNOW COMPUTERS CAN BEAT HUMANS AT THE GAMES OF CHESS GO JEOPARDY ETC BUT WE WANT TO KNOW IF THE COMPUTER IS AWARE OF ITSELF AND ITS ENVIRONMENT DOES THE COMPUTER HAVE A SENSE OF SATISFACTION IN WINNING THE GAME AT THIS TIME IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT COMPUTERS HAVE DEVELOPED MUCH OF THIS CAPABILITY BUT THE TERM CONSCIOUSNESS IS A VERY ACCEPTABLE LANGUAGE TERM AS APPLIED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
I AGREE BUT FOR SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT REASONS MY REASONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE INFINITY OF CHOICE ASSOCIATED WITH REALITY AT ANY GIVEN TIME THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES CONSCIOUSNESS IS CAPABLE OF ASSESSING THIS AND RESPONDING WHERE AS TO MY KNOWLEDGE COMPUTERS ARE INCAPABLE DUE TO LIMITATIONS IN MATHEMATICS BECAUSE AI WOULD STRICTLY RELY ON MATHEMATICS IT CAN NEVER HAVE WHAT WE PERCEIVE AS CONSCIOUSNESS

CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG
THERE ARE SOME PRETTY GLARING ISSUES WITH THIS ARGUMENT

FIRST CONSIDER THE FACT THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THE MIND IS ACTUALIZED IF THE BRAIN IS THE THING THAT PRODUCES THE MIND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THIS MEANS THAT YOUR ANALOGY FAILS

WE KNOW HOW MONA LISA IS PRODUCED AND WHAT KIND OF PROPERTIES THE DOLPHIN LACKS WITH WHICH TO DO THE SAME WE DON'T KNOW HOW THE MIND IS PRODUCED SO WE DON'T KNOW WHICH PROPERTIES THE AI WOULD HAVE TO LACK
DOES HE ALSO NOT THINK THAT THE BASIC LINGUISTIC ERRORS AND UNDERSTANDING BEHIND THEM WHEN WE USE TERMS LIKE CONSCIOUSNESS AND BEING SELF AWARE WOULD NOT APPLY TO AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE WAY THAT WE WOULD IMPLY IT DOES FOR EXAMPLE AN AI LIKE SKYNET FROM THE TERMINATOR MOVIES IT WOULDN'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER DECISIONS BASED ON A SIMILAR THOUGHT PATTERN TO OURSELVES IT MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF ITS OWN PROCESSES AND IF IT WAS HOW WOULD IT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO CHANGE THEM IF YOU CREATED AN AI THAT WAS AN EXPERT IN ASSIMILATING INFORMATION AND CALCULATING PROBABILITY TO PREDICT THE CORRECT COURSE OF ACTION TO FOLLOW IT'S PROGRAMMED DIRECTIVES THEN GAVE IT THE ACCESS TO THE MATERIALS REQUIRED TO DO SO THEN TERMINATOR STYLE SCENARIOS COULD EASILY HAPPEN IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE EVIL HAVE A GOAL HATE THE HUMAN RACE OR EVEN BE AWARE OF WHAT IT'S DOING BUT BEING PROGRAMMED INCORRECTLY WOULD MANIFEST THE SAME RESULT THEN THERE IS THE BASIC LINGUISTIC ARGUMENT ON THE DEFINITIONS OF THINGS SUCH AS CONSCIOUSNESS AND SELF AWARENESS THAT SEARLE SEEMS TO ASSUME WOULD HAVE TO BE HUMAN IN NATURE TO BE CLASSED AS SO THIS IS PRETTY CLOSED MINDED CONSIDERING THE EFFECT OF HOW THE HUMAN MIND IS CAPABLE OF ASSIMILATING INFORMATION CALCULATING OUTCOMES CHANGING THE WORLD AROUND THEM AND BRING THAT PRODUCT INTO THE REAL WORLD IF YOU TALE AWAY THAT BASIC DEFINITION WOULD THE AI PROPOSED DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING IN THE END MANIFESTING A DIRECTIVE INTO REALITY WHO CARES ABOUT THE LABELS OF THE INVISIBLE WHEN THAT IS SO
THIS ISN'T AN ARGUMENT SO APOLOGIES TO THE MODS BUT TIM CRANE IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL
THE OPENING PARAGRAPHS

MANY PHILOSOPHERS ARE IMPRESSED BY THE PROGRESS ACHIEVED BY PHYSICAL
SCIENCES THIS HAS HAD AN ESPECIALLY DEEP EFFECT ON THEIR ONTOLOGICAL VIEWS IT
HAS MADE MANY OF THEM PHYSICALIST PHYSICALIST BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS
PHYSICAL MORE PRECISELY THAT ALL ENTITIES PROPERTIES RELATIONS AND FACTS ARE
THOSE WHICH ARE STUDIED BY PHYSICS OR OTHER PHYSICAL SCIENCES THEY MAY NOT
ALL AGREE WITH THE SPIRIT OF QUOTED REMARK THAT THERE IS PHYSICS
AND THERE IS
BUT THEY ALL GRANT PHYSICAL SCIENCE A UNIQUE
ONTOLOGICAL AUTHORITY THE AUTHORITY TO TELL US WHAT THERE IS

PHYSICALISM IS NOW ALMOST ORTHODOX IN MUCH PHILOSOPHY NOTABLY IN
MUCH RECENT PHILOSOPHY OF MIND BUT ALTHOUGH OFTEN INVOKED IT IS RARELY
EXPLICITLY DEFINED IT SHOULD BE THE CLAIM THAT EVERYTHING IS PHYSICAL IS NOT
AS CLEAR AS IT SEEMS IN THIS PAPER WE EXAMINE A NUMBER OF PROPOSED
DEFINITIONS OF PHYSICALISM AND REASONS FOR BEING A PHYSICALIST WE WILL
ARGUE BOTH THAT PHYSICALISM LACKS A CLEAR AND CREDIBLE DEFINITION AND THAT
IN NO INTERPRETATION IS IT TRUE
DELETED
IT IS THE WORK OF THE LOGICIAN TO PENETRATE THROUGH THE ARBITRARY ORDER OF EXPERIENCE AND SEE INTO THE NECESSARY LOGICAL CONCEPTUAL RELATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS AS A SPECIFIC SYSTEMATIC AND UNITARY ORGANIC WHOLE

HOW DID YOU COME TO THIS CONCLUSION HEGEL SPECIFICALLY ARGUES AGAINST CORPORATISM AS DOES GABRIEL WHO YOU ALSO CITE EVEN IN AS YOU SPECIFIED THE CONTEXT OF THE LOGIC NOT EMPIRICAL OBJECTS IN GENERAL THE PROBLEM OF EXPERIENCE FOR HEGEL IS NOT HOW TO DEDUCE UNITY FROM THE APPEARANCE OF ARBITRARINESS BUT THE OPPOSITE HOW TO ISOLATE AND REDUCE ORGANIC EXPERIENCE IN ALL ITS RICHNESS TO SINGULAR CATEGORIES

THIS IS OF COURSE RELATED TO THE STATUS OF APPEARANCE LOGICAL ELEMENTS WHICH SEEM TO REVEAL AN UNDERLYING ESSENCE IN TRUTH RETROACTIVELY GENERATE THE ESSENCE APPEARANCE IS ESSENCE INSOFAR AS APPEARANCE GENERATES THE ILLUSION OF UNDERLYING ESSENCE I'M PROBABLY UNINTENTIONALLY QUOTING GABRIEL HERE WHO SPENDS A LOT OF TIME ON THIS TOPIC

HENCE RATHER THAN COMPLETION IT'S MORE ACCURATE TO TERM THE HEGELIAN ABSOLUTE INCOMPLETION THE ABSOLUTE IS THE COMPLETION OR CONCLUDING MOMENT OF SYSTEM BUT THE RESULT IS NECESSARILY AND CONSTITUTIVELY A FAILURE THE SPIRIT THAT KNOWS ITSELF COMPLETELY KNOWS ITS CONSTITUTIVE INCOMPLETENESS ABSOLUTE KNOWING INCLUDES ITS OWN IGNORANCE INSOFAR AS

FROM THE ABSOLUTE STANDPOINT ALL OTHER THINGS ARE RELATIVE AND ARE OBJECTIVELY INFERIOR FALSE OR INCOMPLETE IN KIND BY FAILING TO LIVE UP TO THE ABSOLUTE S COMPLETE SELF-DETERMINATION

THE ABSOLUTE ITSELF IS LIKEWISE FALSE INCOMPLETE FAILED THE ABSOLUTE CONTAINS ITS POINT

THE ABSTRACT OF THE ARTICLE

BROADLY SPEAKING THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF THEORIES OF TRUTH PHILOSOPHICAL AND
LOGICAL THE PHILOSOPHICAL THEORIES OF TRUTH GO BACK TO THE GREEKS AND FORWARD
TO THE PRESENT DAY AMONG THESE ARE THE CORRESPONDENCE COHERENTIST PRAG
MAIST DEFLATIONARY AND PRIMITIVIST THEORIES OF TRUTH LOGICAL THEORIES OF TRUTH
ARE ROUGHLY OF TWO KINDS SEMANTICAL OR DEFINITIONAL AND AXIOMATIC TARSKI
INAUGURATED SEMANTICAL THEORIES IN THE MID WITH HIS DEFINITION OF TRUTH
FOR A LOGICALLY CIRCUMSCRIBED LANGUAGE WITHIN A METALANGUAGE FOR IT I EAST IN A
TYPED SETTING IN ORDER TO AVOID INCONSISTENCY HOWEVER THE ORDINARY USE OF
TRUTH IN NATURAL LANGUAGE IS UNTYPED AND SO BEGINNING IN THE ATTEMPTS
WERE MADE TO OBTAIN USEFUL CONSISTENT UNTYPED SEMANTICAL THEORIES BY GIVING
UP SOME OF TARSKI S BASIC ASSUMPTIONS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WAS DUE
TO KRIPKE IN WHO DEFINED A NOTION OF TRUTH FOR AN UNTYPED THREE-VALUED
LANGUAGE MY AXIOMATIZATION OF KRIPKE S MODEL A FEW YEARS LATER INAUGURATED
A CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORK ON A VARIETY OF AXIOMATIC THEORIES THAT CONTINUES
TO BE ACTIVELY PURSUED IN THIS PAPER GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE PRESENTED AS
TO WHY ONE SHOULD AXIOMATIZE THEORIES OF TRUTH AND WHAT CRITERIA SHOULD BE
APPLIED TO THEM THESE ARE THEN ILLUSTRATED WITH THREE EXAMPLES FROM MY OWN
WORK AS TO HOW ONE MIGHT TRY TO GO ABOUT MEETING THESE CRITERIA

WOW THANKS FOR POSTING THIS I HADN'T SEEN IT AND IT'S TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING WORK AXIOMATIC THEORY OF TRUTH F HAS BEEN SO INFLUENTIAL ON SO MANY PEOPLE WORKING ON TRUTH TODAY

I JUST SAW RIGHT NOW IN LOOKING UP THAT LINK THAT HE JUST DIED IN JULY OBIT WHAT A LOSS THAT IS I'LL RAISE A GLASS TO HIM TONIGHT
THIS REALLY SPOKE TO ME THAT EXISTENCE IS FIRST MEANINGLESS IS SUCH AN ABSURD THING TO IMAGINE THE ABSURDITY OF IT IS SO MIND-BOGGLING THAT ONE ALMOST FORGETS THAT HAVING NO REASON TO LIVE IS NOT A REASON TO DIE IF ANYTHING LIFE NOT HAVING A PURPOSE IS WHAT MAKES IT WORTH EXPERIENCING THE INTRO TO THE MOVIE RUBBER I THINK SUMS THIS WHOLE IDEA UP PERFECTLY


THANK-YOU FOR THE READ I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF CAMUS

THIS POST SITTING HERE THIS MORNING IS AN EXAMPLE OF TRULY PERFECT TIMING

CAMUS WAS UTTERLY BRILLIANT THE ISSUE HOWEVER IS THAT HE ASKS US TO ACCEPT THE ABSURD WHICH MANY CANNOT DO LOGIC IS ONLY SO STRONG SINCE YOU CANNOT SAY FOR SURE THERE IS NO MEANING CAMUS PHILOSOPHICAL JOURNEY COMES TO A STANDSTILL IF I CANNOT ACCEPT MEANINGLESSNESS THEN I WILL FOREVER BE SEARCHING FOR MEANING AT THE SAME TIME IF I CANNOT ACCEPT MEANING THEN I MUST FIND A WAY TO LIVE WE HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING TO SURVIVE THIS IS THE OBJECTIVE TRUTH WHICH CAMUS IMPLIES AGAIN AND AGAIN

THE QUESTION FOR THE AVERAGE HUMAN BECOMES WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS MEANING CAN I FIND THE WILL TO LIVE IF I ACCEPT ABSURDITY I WILL CREATE MY OWN MEANING IN LIFE IF I ACCEPT RATIONAL INTENTION OR PURPOSEFULNESS OUTSIDE MY SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE THEN I MUST UNDERSTAND IT TO DO MY JOB OR PURPOSE IN THE FIRST PLACE

THIS BATTLING SUICIDE IS REALLY AN IDEOLOGICAL BATTLE THAT FORCES A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDERSTANDING WILL EITHER PROVIDE US WITH THE WILL TO EXPERIENCE AND REVOLT WITH PASSION THE ABILITY TO LOVE AND GIVE OR WILL PROVIDE US WITH THE MOTIVATION TO DIE AND THUS NO LONGER EXPERIENCE LIFE

WHAT IS YOUR ROCK AND IS IT WORTH LIVING TO EXPERIENCE THAT ROCK IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL TO DECIDE
FOR THOSE WHO FIND LIFE HARD TO BEAR OR PERHAPS FOR ALL OF US WHEN WE FIND LIFE HARD TO BEAR CAMUS IS AN ODD BUT WONDERFUL COMPANION ENTIRELY EMPATHIZING WITH OUR DESPAIR YET CHEERING US ON TO LIVE AND EVEN SEE A HAPPINESS IN OUR STRUGGLE

I REVILED CAMUS AS A SIMPLE-MINDED ELITIST WHEN I FIRST READ HIM IT STRUCK ME AS UNSYMPATHETIC AND OUT OF TOUCH TO THINK THAT SISYPHUS COULD FIND MEANING IN HIS TASK AND THAT MAYBE CAMUS ABILITY TO SEE IT THAT WAY WAS A FAILURE TO EMPATHIZE WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE REAL LOTS IN LIFE SARCASTICALLY CONTRASTING THE AVERAGE WORKING-CLASS SISYPHUS IN MY OWN MIND WITH SAY A DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY WHO ALMOST CERTAINLY ENJOYS A COMPARABLY MORE COMFORTABLE LIFESTYLE I THOUGHT THE WHOLE NOTION OF THE ABSURDITY WAS SADISTIC TO PITCH AS RELEVANT WHEN IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO FIND THEIR PLACE WITHOUT BEING PROVOKED TO CONSIDER THEIR NICHE ON THAT LEVEL

BUT THIS IS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL TREATMENT OF THE ABSURDITY NOTION THAT GETS CAMUS SENSE OF SOLIDARITY ACROSS LIKE HE MOST PROBABLY MEANT IT IT'S NOT ABOUT LETTING YOU RUN THE RAT RACE WHILE I GO OFF AND WAX PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT HOW IT ALL GETS BETTER ALREADY QUITE ASSURED THAT MY PLACE IN HISTORY IS TO BE DOCUMENTED AND APPRECIATED IT'S ABOUT HOW YOU AND I BOTH ULTIMATELY HAVE REASONS TO HATE THIS LIFE AND DECIDE THAT WE HAVE NO PLACE IN IT AND HOW AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO GO OUT AND DECIDE THAT THAT RAT RACE IS JUST A MUNDANE FACET OF THE MUCH GREATER MOSAICS THAT ARE OUR LIVES IN THE STRICTEST SENSE EVEN THE DEMIGODS RUN THAT RACE BECAUSE THEY DIE JUST THE SAME AND THEY HAVE NO LESS RIGHT TO FEAR ITS END THAN THE REST OF US MORTALS CAMUS WAS CHAMPIONING NOT PONTIFICATING AND I'M TOUCHED TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT

THANKS FOR SHARING THIS ARTICLE OP IT'S REALLY FULFILLING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOUR MIND CHANGED IN THAT RADICAL AND EXCITING FASHION

EDIT REPLACED AN AMBIGUOUS PRONOUN WITH CAMUS
WOW THAT WAS AMAZING AND SO CONCISELY EXPLAINS CAMUS ENTIRE BOOK IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL READ AND A REMINDER OF WHY I GRAVITATED TO CAMUS IN MY IT'S BEEN A CONSTANT ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE ABSURDITY AND A STRUGGLE TO BE HAPPY IN SPITE OF SO TO SPEAK

BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN AND THANK YOU OP FOR POSTING IT
THIS WAS FANTASTIC I WROTE SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR FOR PHILOSOPHY NOW LAST MONTH AND I'M PLEASED HOW MUCH IT DOVETAILED WITH THIS

ISSUES
I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS IT WAS AN AMAZING READ THAT REALLY MOVED ME AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO HAVE FOUND THE ON BEING WEBSITE AND PODCAST
I LOVED THIS THANKS FOR SHARING
CAMUS IS A POWERFUL AND CAPTIVATING WRITER WHO TAPS INTO A VERY ESSENTIAL PART OF US ALL I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT CAMUS REALLY WAS AN EXISTENTIALIST DESPITE DENYING IT AND SARTRE DOING THE SAME CAMUS WANTED TO BE APPRECIATED AS A WRITER OR RATHER AN ARTIST WHO DIDN'T HAVE DRY PHILOSOPHICAL PROPOSITIONS IN HIS WORK LIKE A TYPICAL PHILOSOPHER IN OTHER WORDS I AM SUGGESTING THAT HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN IDEOLOGICAL ICON WRITING UNDER THE GUISE OF FICTION AND COLOURFUL ESSAYS HE PROBABLY WANTED HIS WORK TO BE APPRECIATED AS MANY GREAT ARTISTS DO WITH THAT BEING SAID READING THE PLAGUE OR THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS IT'S EASY TO RECOGNIZE THAT HE WAS A KEEN CONTRIBUTOR TO THE EXISTENTIALIST MOVEMENT JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WRITE MORE CUT AND DRY PHILOSOPHY LIKE SARTRE AND BEAUVOIR DOESN'T MEAN HE WASN'T TACKLING PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS AND ALL THE WHILE MAKING PROPOSALS
MAN SHOULD WANT TO LIVE AT LEAST OUT OF CURIOSITY
I'VE ACCEPTED THAT LIFE HAS NO MEANING FOR ME YET I'VE NEVER CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE IT JUST SEEMED NATURAL THAT THE ONLY COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO LIVE MY TIME LONG OR SHORT SHOULD BE FILLED WITH RICH EXPERIENCE GOOD OR BAD THE PURPOSE IS TO LIVE AND IF I NEVER HAVE SHARED THOSE EXPERIENCES WITH ANYONE THAN I'LL CHERISH THEM EVEN MORE BECAUSE THEY ARE UNIQUE AND THEY ARE MINE NEVER TO BE REPEATED AGAIN I FIND COMFORT IN THAT LOGIC
DID YOU EVER HEAR THE STORY OF ICARUS WHO CONTINUALLY ROLLED THE BALL UP THE HILL BUT WHEN HE GOT TOO CLOSE THE BALL MELTED IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN YOU'RE ALL LIKE ICARUS
CAMUS

BUT JUST TO BE A PEDANT HE WASN'T AN EXISTENTIALIST
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS IT REMINDS ME OF BEING YOUNG
WHAT A VERY OPEN WAY TO THINK ABOUT LIFE THIS WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL READ THANK YOU
I READ THIS ARTICLE SEVERAL DAYS AGO AND I FOUND IT VERY TIMELY ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE RECENT REPORTS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE I REACTED PRETTY BADLY TO WHAT SEEMS TO BE GUARANTEED GLOBAL DISASTER OR ONE CAN ARGUE AN INCREASE IN GLOBAL DISASTERS IT'S BEEN HARD FOR ME TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT CHOOSING TO LIVE IS VALID BUT I FOUND COMFORT AND A LITTLE FREEDOM TO KEEP PUSHING FORWARD AFTER READING THIS EVEN THOUGH I DON'T FEEL AS HOPEFUL ABOUT THIS WORLD AS I USED TO BE
THIS IS AN AMAZING READ THANK YOU
I FOUND THE ARTICLE A VERY GOOD READ AND IT OPENS UP CAMUS QUITE WELL WITHOUT HAVING TO READ THE WHOLE OF ANY OF HIS WORKS

HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS

THE ABSURD FOR CAMUS WAS THE PARADOX BETWEEN OUR IMPULSE TO ASK ULTIMATE QUESTIONS AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ACHIEVING ANY ADEQUATE ANSWER HE DOESN'T STATE THAT LIFE IS MEANINGLESS BUT THAT IT IS FUTILE ABSURD TO SEARCH FOR AN ANSWER
2 REVOLT FOR CAMUS IS NOT BASED AROUND DEATH IT IS BASED AROUND ACCEPTING THE ABSURDITY OF LIFE AS STATED PREVIOUSLY AND LIVING IN SPITE OF IT THIS IS WHY HE STATES THAT EACH DAY IS A STRUGGLE FOR THE ABSURD MAN LIVING WITH A CONSTANT SENSE OF EXISTENTIAL ANGST

THIS HAS SOME GOOD FURTHER INFORMATION ON CAMUS
NEVER HAVE FOUND A REASON TO LIVE I STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION LPT RUNNING AND WORKING OUT A TON HELPS A TON BUT THAT WAS MUCH LESS SO WHY I WANTED TO DIE EVEN IN MY HAPPIEST TIMES I WANTED TO DIE FOR THE INTELLECTUAL LACK OF VALUE IN IT THE SIMPLEST FORM IS TO INQUIRE WHAT HAPPENS AROUND ME AFTER I DIE THE REALITY IS THAT THE EFFECTS OF DEATH ON OTHERS WEARS OFFICIAL THE THING THAT KEEPS ME ALIVE IS RELIGION AND A BIG FAMILY I COULDN'T DO THAT TO MY NEPHEWS AND NIECE THEY WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IS SO ODD TO ME THAT ANYONE WOULD WANT TO LIVE
STARING AT THE SEA STARING AT THE SAND
THANK YOU FOR THIS IT WAS WHAT I NEEDED TO READ AND UNDERSTAND AT THIS TIME IN MY LIFE
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE MEURSAULT INVESTIGATION BY KAMEL DAOUD IT IS A FANTASTIC RESPONSE TO THE WORKS OF CAMUS BY A MAN WHO HAS SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE IN ALGERIA LIVING IN CAMUS SHADOW IN MY B A I READ ALMOST EVERYTHING CAMUS HAS WRITTEN EXCEPT SOME OF HIS UNFINISHED WORKS AND THIS BOOKS RANKS UP THEIR WITH THE BEST OF THEM ESPECIALLY FOR IT'S ARTISTRY

NOTE I WOULD ONLY READ THIS BOOK AFTER HAVING READ THE STRANGER THE FALL THE PLAGUE AND HAVING A FAMILIARITY WITH THE MYTH OF SYSIPHUS
WELL THAT WAS AWESOME
THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT HAS NEVER REALLY MESHED WELL WITH ME AS IT SEEMS TO ONLY APPLY TO AN
EXISTENTIAL CRISIS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE THOUGHT THAT LIFE MAY HAVE NO MEANING I HOWEVER
DO NOT PARTICULARLY LIKE EXISTENCE AND VIEW IT AS CURSE BURDEN THAT I WANTED NO PART OF YET
I AM HERE THROUGH SOMEONE BULLSHIT DECISION MY DISCONTENT STILL APPLIES EVEN IF THERE WAS
AN OBJECTIVE MEANING TO LIFE
BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT YOU CHOOSING LIFE BUT LIFE CHOOSING YOU MAN MIND BLOWN
OH MAN IT HAS BEEN A WHILE SINCE I READ THE MYTH OF SISYPHUS BUT THAT SHIT STAYS WITH YA I LIKE HIS TAKE ON HOPE PERSONALLY THOUGH IT CAN BE KINDA DARK I GUESS DON JUAN IS FUCKING HILARIOUS THOUGH
IT WAS ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD READ IT REMINDED ME OF KIERKEGAARD LEVELING OR LEVELLING WHICH IS A FORM OF NIHILISM I CLAIM NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPT PRESENTED HERE FOR I'M NO PHILOSOPHER BUT I DEFINITELY DO ENJOY TO INTELLIGENTLY INTELLIGENCE AS AN EQUIVALENT TO CONSCIOUSNESS CHOOSE THE ABSURD OVER THE LOGICAL

THE WORLD IS ABSURD BUT PEOPLE AREN'T OR SO WE FOOL OURSELVES TO BELIEVE

WE STRUGGLE TO EMBRACE CONSCIOUSNESS WE'RE AFRAID TO SUCCEED AND RECOGNIZE THAT AS INDIVIDUALS WE'RE MENTALLY ILL FOR IT IS NO MEASURE OF HEALTH TO BE WELL ADJUSTED TO A PROFOUNDLY SICK SOCIETY THAT MIGHT JUST BE WHAT'S NOT WORKING



LEVELLING AT ITS MAXIMUM IS LIKE THE STILLNESS OF DEATH WHERE ONE CAN HEAR ONE'S OWN HEARTBEAT A STILLNESS LIKE DEATH INTO WHICH NOTHING CAN PENETRATE IN WHICH EVERYTHING SINKS POWERLESS ONE PERSON CAN HEAD A REBELLION BUT ONE PERSON CANNOT HEAD THIS LEVELLING PROCESS FOR THAT WOULD MAKE HIM A LEADER AND HE WOULD AVOID BEING LEVELLED EACH INDIVIDUAL CAN IN HIS LITTLE CIRCLE PARTICIPATE IN THIS LEVELLING BUT IT IS AN ABSTRACT PROCESS AND LEVELLING IS ABSTRACTION CONQUERING INDIVIDUALITY

SIREN KIERKEGAARD THE PRESENT AGE TRANSLATED BY ALEXANDER DRU WITH FOREWORD BY WALTER KAUFMANN PP

NIHILISM A NIHILIST IS A MAN WHO JUDGES OF THE WORLD AS IT IS THAT IT OUGHT NOT TO BE AND OF THE WORLD AS IT OUGHT TO BE THAT IT DOES NOT EXIST ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW OUR EXISTENCE ACTION SUFFERING WILLING FEELING HAS NO MEANING THE PATHOS OF IN VAIN IS THE NIHILISTS PATHOS AT THE SAME TIME AS PATHOS AN INCONSISTENCY ON THE PART OF THE NIHILISTS

FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE ASA TAKEN FROM THE WILL TO POWER SECTION TRANSLATED BY WALTER KAUFMANN
EVERY TIME I TAKE THE TIME TO READ SOMEONE'S WRITINGS ON CAMUS ABSURDISM I HATE HIM MORE AND MORE I DEALT WITH DEPRESSION FOR YEARS AND ANYONE THAT HAS BEEN OR IS DEEP IN DEPRESSION WOULD LOOK AT HIS REASON TO LIVE AND RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH OF A BS ANSWER THAT IT IS VERY FEW SO FEW THAT I MIGHT AS WELL SAY NO ONE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOUGHT OF COMMUTING SUICIDE HAD EVER THOUGHT YEAH I'M GONNA DO THIS TO REVOLT AGAINST LIFE IT'S THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE DAY TO DAY ANYMORE AND JUST SAYING THAT YOU SHOULD BECAUSE APPARENTLY LIFE IS ABSURD AND WORTH LIVING IS UTTER CRAP I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE PERSON EVER SAY THAT THIS THOUGHT PROCESS HELPED THEM THROUGH TOUGH TIMES
COOL DUDE WENT THROUGH HALF OF IT REALLY PAYING ATTENTION SAVED FOR LATER
AS FAR AS THE MYTH ITSELF GOES

WAS SYSIPHUS CHOOSING TO KEEP PUSHING THE ROCK ACCORDING TO WIKIPEDIA IN OVID SISYPHUS RESTS FROM HIS LABOR FOR A MOMENT UPON HEARING ORPHEUS MUSIC MAKING IT SEEM LIKE HE HAD A CHOICE

BUT SINCE THIS IS A PUNISHMENT WASN'T HE UNDER SOME KIND OF COMPULSION IN THE MYTH LIKE SAY HYPNOSIS OR WAS HE PROMISED A REWARD FOR PLACING THE ROCK UP THE HILL

THE ARTICLE ALSO SEEMS TO SAY THAT SISYPHUS IS CHOOSING TO LIVE

SISYPHUS PERSEVERES AND RESISTS THE LURE OF SUICIDE

BUT HE'S ACTUALLY IN THE UNDERWORLD UNDER THE TERMS OF HIS CONDITION IS SUICIDE AN OPTION WIKI IS HAZY ON THIS SINCE THERE'S AN IMPRESSION THAT SISYPHUS WAS IMPRISONED BY ZEUS WITHOUT AN ACTUAL DEATH

I KNOW THESE ARE MINOR POINT COMPARED TO CAMUS PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE AN INTEREST IN MYTHOLOGY AND I'M TRYING TO SQUARE THE VARIOUS CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE MYTH WITH CAMUS VIEW OF ACCEPTING ABSURDITY
EXCELLENTLY WRITTEN ARTICLE
COMING FROM A RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND WHERE MEANING AND PURPOSE WERE RIGIDLY OBJECTIVE AND SET IN STONE BY ANCIENT MEN CLINGING TO THE CONSTRUCT OF A DEISTIC FIGURE THAT WE ARE TO FOLLOW WITHOUT QUESTION BLINDLY IT WAS A CONSTANT STRUGGLE AN OVERWHELMINGLY STRESSFUL ONE TO STRIVE FOR SUCH UNREALISTIC AND NARROW MINDED GOALS THAT WERE NOT OF MY OWN CHOOSING OR DESIRE REALIZING THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF SUCH A CONCEPT AND BREAKING FREE WAS QUITE LIBERATING NOW I LIVE TOWARD MY OWN GOALS AND HAPPINESS REALIZING THAT THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG WAY TO LIVE AS SUCH CONCEPTS OF PURPOSE MEANING AND VALUE ARE ARBITRARY AND SUBJECTIVE INTRINSICALLY THEY DO NOT EXIST AS LONG AS I AM HAPPY DOING WHAT I WANT THEN THAT IS THE CORRECT WAY FOR ME TO LIVE DAMN WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD MAY THINK OR SAY

WHEN I READ THE STRANGER I ODDLY ENOUGH IDENTIFIED WITH THE PROTAGONIST COMPLETELY TO QUOTE AN ARTIST OF A DIFFERENT STROKE IT'S ALL A JOKE A MONSTROUS DEMENTED GAG SO WHY ARENT YOU LAUGHING
I LIKE WHAT HE'S GOT TO SAY HOWEVER I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES IN DUALISM WOULD RESPOND
I DISAGREE WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING HE SAID I'M ON MOBILE SO I DON'T CARE TO TYPE IT OUT I WILL SOMEDAY BEFORE I KILL MYSELF OR I'LL FORGET IT DOESN'T MATTER
IT IS PRETTY SIMPLE ACTUALLY OTHER SPECIES DON'T REALLY GO AND OFF THEMSELVES YOUR SPECIES IS SELF-TORTURING THEMSELVES TO THE POINT OF SUICIDE YOU'RE DEFINITELY THINGS THEN NOT MUCH PHILOSOPHY CAN DO ABOUT IT THEY ARE THE WORST OFFENDERS
FUCKING AWESOME
THE PERSON WHO UNDERSTANDS THE ABSURDITY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION IS STRENGTHENED BY IT HE OR SHE STILL HAS TO WORK UNCEASINGLY TO BEAR UP UNDER THE WEIGHT OF BEING BUT IT IS WORTH IT THERE IS NO HIGHER DESTINY CAMUS DECLARES THE ABSURD MAN IS THE MASTER OF HIS DAYS WHEN HE GAZES BACKWARD OVER HIS LIFE HE CONTEMPLATES THAT SERIES OF UNRELATED ACTIONS WHICH BECOMES HIS FATE CREATED BY HIM AND LIKE SISYPHUS AND HIS ROCK THE WHOLE SEEMINGLY UNREASONABLE EFFORT TURNS OUT TO HAVE MEANING JUST BECAUSE IT CONSTITUTED HIS LIFE

LOVE THE IDEA OF OUR ACTIONS ACTIVELY DICTATING OUR FATE AFTER LOOKING BACK ON TIME SPENT IN THIS WORLD MAYBE I'M TOO OPTIMISTIC FOR THIS SUB THOUGH
REMOVED
FUCK CAMUS THE UNIVERSE IS AT MOST BILLION YEARS OLD LEAVING AT LEAST TRILLION YEARS OF USABLE ENTROPY WE'RE EARLY YET CAMUS WAS BEFORE WE COULD GET THERE WE CAN THE LEAST OF US WITH CRYONICS THE REST THROUGH THE SINGULARITY IT ALWAYS AMUSES ME MODERNIST DEATHISTS WITH HOW WE'RE DESTINED TO CEASE WHEN WE'RE AT THAT POINT WHERE WE CAN LIVE A FUCKING LONG TIME ASSUMING ENTROPY APPLIES DOES THEN THE ASHES APPLY
WHAT A LOAD OF NONSENSE I DARE ANYONE WHO'S EVEN REMOTELY THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING THEMSELVES OR WANTS TO KILL THEMSELVES TO DO IT

STAYING ALIVE IS EASY DYING IS HARD THAT'S WHY IN SUICIDE ATTEMPTS FAIL AN EVEN GREATER AMOUNT THINK ABOUT IT BUT NEVER DO IT IT'S SO HARD FOR MOST TO OVERCOME THEIR PROGRAMMING MOST SIMPLY DON'T HAVE IT IN THEM




IN MY OPINION THE DEFINING OF MARXISM AS SIMPLY A CRITIQUE OF CAPITALISM IS WAY TOO SIMPLISTIC A STATEMENT YES MARXISM CONTAINS WITHIN IT VARIOUS CRITIQUES OF CAPITALISM BUT TO LIMIT MARXISM TO ONLY SUCH A TOPIC REALLY DOESN'T DO THE DEPTH OF MARXIST THOUGHT JUSTICE

SECONDLY THE CONFLATION OF MARXISM CRITICAL THEORY AND DECONSTRUCTION IS A GROSS MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE THREE IDEAS TO CLAIM MARXISM IS BASED IN CRITICAL THEORY IMPLIES THAT CRITICAL THEORY CAME BEFORE MARXISM WHERE AS IN ACTUALITY THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP OF THE TWO IS THE OPPOSITE ALSO NOT ALL CRITICAL THEORY IS RECONSTRUCTIONIST YES YOU HAVE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CRITICAL THEORY SUCH AS QUEER THEORY WHICH HAS MORE OR LESS EMBRACED A RECONSTRUCTIONIST FORM OF ANALYSIS THANKS TO PEOPLE LIKE BUTLER AND SEDGWICK BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE CRITICAL THEORISTS LIKE HABERMAN WHO CRITICIZED DERRID AND DECONSTRUCTION NOT TO MENTION THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DECONSTRUCTION AND MARXISM ISN'T EXACTLY PERFECT EITHER

LIKE JUST FROM THE OPENING PARAGRAPH BASICALLY YOU OFFER A REDUCTIONIST DEFINITION OF MARXISM AND THEN MISTAKENLY CONFLATE MARXISM WITH CRITICAL THEORY AND RECONSTRUCTIONISM WHICH I FEEL IS A DISHONEST ENGAGEMENT WITH BASICALLY ALL OF THESE CONCEPTS
PENNSYLVANIA IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST FREE SOCIETY IN HISTORY

WAIT WHY


MATE YOUR FIRST PARAGRAPH SAYS WHERE YOU'RE AT

FIRSTLY I SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT IMMANENT CRITIQUE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN GET A DIFFERENT SOCIETY WITHOUT REVERTING TO IDEALISM I EAST WITHOUT JUST IMAGING OR THINKING SUCH A SOCIETY

AND THEN LOOK AT ESSAY ON TRADITIONAL AND CRITICAL THEORY WHICH IS A BASIC AND SHORT EXPOSITION OF WHAT THE CRITICAL THEORISTS ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO AND WHY THEY WERE ATTEMPTING IT THEN I EAST WHY DID THEORY NEED TO BE

THE REST OF WHAT YOU SAID IS EITHER MISNOMERS OR STATEMENTS IN PLACE OF AN ARGUMENT
YOU DO REALIZE THAT HORKHEIMER WAS CRITICAL OF THE BOLSHEVIKS DENOUNCED THE CIVIL WAR EARLY AND SIDED WITH ROSA LUXEMBURG HOWEVER MOST FIGUREHEADS OF THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL DRIFTED INTO ACADEMIC REFORMISM LUKACS MAY HAVE NEVER FULLY DISASSOCIATED HIMSELF FROM STALINISM BUT HE WAS EXPELLED FROM THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE FOR BEING AN LIQUIDATIONIST AND KARL BORSCH FROM THE CPD FOR CRITIQUING THE FATALIST DETERMINISM OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL I SUGGEST READING LABRIOLA ON CORTICAL COMMUNISM ANYWAYS WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE CAPITALIST MONIKER THAT DEBATE IS BEST RESERVED FOR ANOTHER SUBREDDIT PERTAINING TO POLITICAL ECONOMY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY OF THE USSR
CRITICAL THEORY IS A TERM WITH A MUCH SHORTER HISTORY THAN MARXISM PLEASE DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO THE WIDESPREAD PRACTICE OF CONFUSING MARXISM WITH CRITICAL THEORY EVEN IF YOU MEAN TO USE CRITICAL THEORY IN A MORE GENERAL SENSE
THE MOST OPPRESSIVE STATE IN HISTORY WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE SOVIET UNION

ABSURD REALLY THAT'S ALL I CAN SEE WITH THAT STATEMENT THE SOVIET UNION WAS NOT GOOD HOWEVER TO SAY IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST IS PATENTLY ABSURD THE IS AT LEAST A CONVERSATION TO BE HAD THERE THERE IS IN FACT DOUBT

WHICH LENIN HIMSELF CALLED A STATE CAPITALIST GOVERNMENT ULTIMATELY THE THE MOST CENTRALIZED FORM OF CAPITAL POSSIBLE

LENIN DIDN'T PARTICULARLY SEE THIS AS AN ISSUE CONSIDERING HE WAS THE ARCHITECT BEHIND THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY

HOW CAN AN IDEOLOGY THAT PREACHES EQUALITY TRANSCEND HIERARCHY IT CANNOT ANY SYSTEM THAT FORCES EQUALITY HAS TO DO SO THROUGH HIERARCHY AND THROUGH FORCE

IT IS FALSE TO EQUATE FORCE AND HIERARCHY MY GO TO EXAMPLE IS THE WARSAW GHETTO UPRISING WERE THE JEWS RE-CREATING THE HIERARCHY OF RACES THEY TRIED TO ESCAPE BY USING FORCE AGAINST THE NAZIS NUMBER

FORCE IS PURELY ABSTRACT UNLESS TALKED ABOUT IN CONTEXT OF SOMETHING ELSE IT CAN BE IN OPPOSITION TO OR IN SUPPORT OF HIERARCHY


CENTRALIZED POWER MEANS THAT THERE IS A POWER DEFICIT FOR THOSE WHO ARE DECENTRALIZED COMPLETELY DECENTRALIZED POWER WOULD SEEM TO BE CHAOTIC SINCE THERE WOULD BE NO SYSTEM FOR STABILITY AS FOR MARXISM I HAVE NEVER BEEN A FAN AS I DONT THINK IT PLAYS WELL WITH HUMAN NATURE ITSELF WE ARE COMPETITIVE BY NATURE AND NOT VERY ALTRUISTIC HOWEVER AS WE ARE SEEING IN OUR PRESENT WORLD CAPITALISM HAS MASSIVE PATHWAYS TO CORRUPTION BY COMPANIES AND THE GOVERNMENT DON'T BE TO HARD ON YOURSELF CRITICISM IS HOW WE MAKE OURSELVES BETTER
I TOTALLY AGREE THAT MARXISM IS PARASITIC ON CAPITALISM

AND YES MOST CRITICAL THEORY CANNOT STAND ALONE EITHER STUFF LIKE QUEER THEORY AFROPESSIMISM FEMINISM SEEMS HOPELESSLY TIED TO A HIERARCHICAL SOCIETY AND AIMLESS WITHOUT EXISTING CONTRA TO SOMETHING ELSE

CAPITALISM HOWEVER JUST KEEPS DOING IT'S OWN THING FOR GOOD OR BAD IN THE MEANTIME MOSTLY UNCONCERNED WITH WHATEVER ZIZEL OR BUTLER OR COUNTLESS OTHERS ARE WRITING
REMOVED
WHEN GOD MADE THE WORLD HE ORIGINALLY INTENDED AIR TO BE A SCARCE RESOURCE UNTIL HANS HERMANN HOPPE TOLD HIM OTHERWISE
HEY EVERYONE JUST FINISHED THIS PAPER FOR MY MEDICAL ETHICS CLASSICAL PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK AND HOW I CAN IMPROVE AS A WRITER I REALLY APPRECIATE ANY FEEDBACK YOU'RE ALL WILLING TO GIVE

REALLY INTERESTING TAKE ON THIS IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY CONSEQUENTIAL REALM OF PHILOSOPHY I LOVE IT I JUST HAVE ONE OBJECTION QUESTION YOU QUOTED JOHN STEWART MILL IN JUSTIFYING THE RIGHT TO DIE BY SAYING SOMETHING TO THE TUNE OF TRUE FREEDOM DOES NOT JUST MEAN FREEDOM TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION BUT ALSO THE WRONG ONE I'M PARAPHRASING BUT I'M SURE YOU KNOW THE QUOTE IF YOU APPLY THIS LOGIC TO THE CASE OF SAY A YEAR OLD KID WHO JUST GOT KICKED OUT OF COLLEGE AND IS ADDICTED TO DRUGS AND IS TOTALLY HOPELESS AND DEPRESSED WOULD YOU ARGUE THAT HE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO END HIS OWN LIFE CONSIDERING THAT HE'S NOT IN THE MOST RATIONAL STATES OF MIND IF YOU SAY YES TO THAT WOULD YOU ANSWER THE SAME TO A SIMILAR SCENARIO BUT REPLACING A YEAR OLD WITH A YEAR OLD IF NO AT WHAT POINT IN LIFE DO HUMAN BEINGS HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHEN THEY CAN END THEIR LIVES AND WHY AT THAT POINT EXCELLENT POST BY THE WAY AND I DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH YOU I JUST LIKE THINKING ABOUT THESE OBJECTIONS SO I CAN REFINE AND ADD NUANCE TO MY OWN POSITION
THAT'S A VERY MEANINGFUL DISTINCTION YOU DRAW BETWEEN THE MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY ILL HOWEVER IF YOU ARE DEPRESSED AND IT IS DEMONSTRABLY BECAUSE OF A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY AND YOU ARE GOING TO KILL YOURSELF CAN IT REALLY BE SAID TO BE OF YOUR OWN VOLITION AREN'T YOU JUST AS SURELY GOING TO KILL YOURSELF ON THE REFUSAL OF TREATMENT AS YOU WOULD BE TO DIE IF YOU WERE TERMINALLY ILL TO ILLUSTRATE TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A CRIMINAL WHO IS LET OFF EASIER BECAUSE HE PLEADS INSANITY YOU CANNOT HOLD SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTIONS WHICH THEIR AGENCY HAD LITTLE TO NOW CONTROL OVER IF YOU CAN HELP IT IF YOU ALLOW A MENTALLY ILL PATIENT TO COMMIT SUICIDE BY WAY OF REFUSING THEM TREATMENT YOU ARE FORCING THEM TO BE PUNISHED ULTIMATELY FOR REASONS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL

I PRETTY MUCH AGREE THAT A DOCTOR SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO REFUSE TO EUTHANIZE ON THE GROUNDS THAT A DOCTOR HAS AUTONOMY BUT IF YOU EXTEND THAT LOGIC THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT A DOCTOR SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO REFUSE TREATMENT AS WELL BECAUSE FORCING THEM TO TREAT SOMEBODY WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THEIR AUTONOMY BUT I WOULD ACTUALLY POSIT THAT WHEN A DOCTOR DECIDES TO BECOME A DOCTOR THEY TAKE ON A RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN DO THAT AND AS SUCH THEY MUST AT TIMES BE FORCED TO DO THINGS AGAINST THEIR OWN AS NOT DOING THEM WOULD ULTIMATELY CAUSE MORE HARM TO THE PATIENT AND VIOLATE THE PATIENTS FREEDOM HOW EXACTLY DO YOU DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN REFUSING TREATMENT AND REFUSING TO EUTHANIZE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ONE WHO WISHES TO BE EUTHANIZED EUTHANIZATION IS TREATMENT

SORRY IF IT SEEMS LIKE I WENT ALL OVER THE PLACE I KINDA DID AND I MOSTLY AGREE WITH YOU JUST VOICING THE SAME CRITICISMS WITH WHICH I CHALLENGE MY OWN VIEW
NO PROBLEM MAKE IT AS LONG AS YOU WANT I LOVE THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY ABOUT SUCH AN INTERESTING TOPIC
IF YOU WOULD CONDENSE MAYBE TOO MUCH WHAT MATHEMATICS IS IT IS REASONING ABOUT STRUCTURES AND RELATIONS BETWEEN STRUCTURES OFTEN WE CAN MODEL NATURE AS THESE RELATIONS BUT THERE ARE MATHEMATICS THAT HAVE VERY LITTLE OR NOTHING TO DO WITH NATURE WE DON'T HAVE TO LIMIT OUR SELVES TO IT

PURE MATH IS THEORY BUILDING WERE WE CAN STUDY THINGS THAT INCREST US IF YOU OPEN ANY GRADUATE TEXTBOOK ABOUT MODEL THEORY ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY OR LARGE CARDINALS YOU ARE GOING TO FEW VERY FEW CROSSPOINTS WITH REALITY

MATH IS QUANTIFYING AND CATALOGING LOGICAL STRUCTURE BUT LOGICALLY POSSIBLE STRUCTURE I EAST STRUCTURE THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN A CONTRADICTION EXTENDS FAR BEYOND WHAT IS PHYSICALLY REALIZABLE SO MATH CANNOT BE GROUNDED IN PHYSICALLY REALIZABLE RELATIONSHIPS
NO ONE REALLY POSTED A GOOD SUMMARY OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE SO HERE WE GO

THE AUTHOR'S DOING SOME BASIC PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS HERE AND ASKING WHAT IS MATHEMATICS ABOUT THE FIRST QUESTION IS IT ABOUT SOMETHING



THEY THROW OUT NOMINALISM FOR TWO REASONS MATHEMATICS HAS CONSEQUENCES IN THE REAL WORLD AND MATHEMATICS IS A VAST AND BROAD FIELD WITH LOTS OF EMERGENT COMPLEXITY

APPLICABILITY IS INDEED ONE OF THE WEAPONS THAT REALISTS USE AGAINST INDISPENSABILITY AND ALL THAT THE SECOND REASON IS A BIT LESS CLEAR BUT IT'S PRETTY INTUITIVE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY EXAMPLES OF FICTIONAL RATIONAL STRUCTURES THAT ARE AS SPRAWLING AND DETAILED AS MATHEMATICS


THEY REJECT PLATONISM FOR TWO REASONS AS WELL EPISTEMIC ACCESS APPLICABILITY THEY NOTE THAT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW ABSTRACT OBJECTS MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE WORLD AT ALL LEADING TO A PROBLEM OF HOW WE MIGHT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THESE THINGS AND HOW THESE THINGS ARE RELATED TO THE OBJECTS WE SEE IN THE WORLD

HOW DOES A PILE OF BALLS CONNECT TO SOME ABSTRACT OBJECT IN THE WORLD AND HOW DOES REMOVING A BALL RECONNECT THAT PILE TO A DIFFERENT OBJECT IT'S WEIRD



AND THEN THE AUTHOR BRAVELY AND INGENIOUSLY DENIES BOTH THESE VIEWS THEY'RE GOING IN A NEW DIRECTION

THEY GO BACK TO APPLICABILITY AND NOTE THAT THE PHYSICAL WORLD IS FULL OF WHAT WE'D DEEM MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES THERE'S SYMMETRY THERE'S RATIOS THEY MAKE THIS RATHER DUBIOUS CLAIM

ANY DIGRESSION INTO APPLIED MATHEMATICS RARELY UNDERTAKEN BY PHILOSOPHERS OF MATHEMATICS WHO PREFER THE FAMILIAR GROUND OF NUMBERS AND LOGIC WILL TURN UP FOR THE ALERT OBSERVER MANY OTHER QUANTITATIVE AND STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT THEMSELVES PHYSICAL BUT CAN BE REALISED IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND ANY OTHER WORLDS THERE MIGHT BE FLOWS ORDER RELATIONS CONTINUITY AND DISCRETENESS ALTERNATION LINEARITY FEEDBACK NETWORK TOPOLOGY AND MANY OTHERS

AS IF THEY'RE A BRAVE EXPLORER CHARTING A NEW CONCEPTUAL WORLD THEY'RE NOT BUT IT SOUNDS BETTER TO SAY EH

AND THEN ARISTOTELIAN REALISM MATHEMATICS IS ABOUT STUDYING KINDS OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES IN THE WORLD MATHEMATICAL NECESSITIES ARE STILL MYSTERIOUS

WHAT IS NECESSARY IS TRUE IN ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS BUT HOW CAN PERCEPTION SEE INTO OTHER POSSIBLE WORLDS THE SCHOLASTICS THE ARISTOTELIAN CATHOLIC PHILOSOPHERS OF THE MIDDLE AGES WERE SO IMPRESSED WITH THE MIND S GRASP OF NECESSARY TRUTHS AS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE INTELLECT WAS IMMATERIAL AND IMMORTAL IF TODAY S NATURALISTS DO NOT WISH TO AGREE WITH THAT THERE IS A CHALLENGE FOR THEM DON T TELL ME SHOW ME BUILD AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM THAT IMITATES GENUINE MATHEMATICAL INSIGHT THERE SEEM TO BE NO PROMISING PLANS ON THE DRAWING BOARD





BUT THEY STOP SHORT HERE WHAT ABOUT MATHEMATICS WITHOUT PHYSICAL INSTANTIATIONS WHAT ABOUT THE METAPHYSICAL STATUS OF THESE PROPERTIES WHAT ABOUT THE ACTUAL PRACTICE OF MATHEMATICS DONE WITH PENCILS AND PAPERS AND TRASHCANS

THIS HAS BEEN POSTED HERE BEFORE I'M PRETTY SURE BECAUSE I REMEMBER HAVING THIS SAME THOUGHT BEFORE COOL IDEA BUT I DON'T FIND IT PARTICULARLY MORE CONVINCING THAN THE OTHER ONES

HIS BOOK IS PROBABLY BETTER FOR THE DETAILS OF COURSE THIS IS JUST BORDERLINE
BECAUSE ARISTOTELIAN REALISM INSISTS ON THE REALIZABILITY OF MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES IN THE WORLD IT CAN GIVE A STRAIGHTFORWARD ACCOUNT OF HOW BASIC MATHEMATICAL FACTS ARE KNOWN BY PERCEPTION THE SAME AS OTHER SIMPLE FACTS

THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT REALIZABLE IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD THE TRANSFINITE NUMBERS DON'T EXIST IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD WE CAN CONSTRUCT HIGHER DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRIES THAT HAVE NO PHYSICAL INSTANTIATION


SO THE PLATONISTS WERE RIGHT TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE ABILITY OF THE HUMAN MIND TO GRASP MATHEMATICAL NECESSITIES THEY JUST FAILED TO NOTICE THAT THOSE NECESSITIES ARE OFTEN REALISED IN THIS WORLD


OFTEN BUT NOT ALWAYS IF THE NECESSITIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY TIED TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD THEN HOW CAN THEIR FOUNDATION BE THE PHYSICAL WORLD
IT SEEMS AS IF PURE MATHEMATICS REVEALS THE TOPOGRAPHY OF A REGION WHOSE TRUTHS INVESTIGATION EVEN LANGUAGE
WHEN ALL THE SCIENCES AND THEIR SUBJECT MATTERS ARE LAID OUT IS THERE ANY ASPECT OF REALITY LEFT OVER FOR MATHEMATICS TO BE ABOUT

YOU HAVE IT WRONG ALL OF THE OTHER SCIENCES ARE REALLY ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE MATHEMATICS OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE BIOLOGY LIFE CHEMISTRY MOLECULES COSMOLOGY PLANETS ETC


MORE LIKE PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS ARE GROUNDED IN MATHEMATICS
CAN'T THE AXIOMS FOR THE INTEGERS SIMPLY BE VIEWED AS A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF A CERTAIN ASPECT OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD

YOU COULD IMAGINE A STRANGE UNIVERSE WHERE IF YOU PUT ROCKS IN A BARREL THEN THROW IN A MORE AND THEN COUNT ALL THE ROCKS FROM SCRATCH YOU FIND THAT THERE ARE NOW NOT EXACTLY ROCKS MAYBE SOME OF THEM SIMPLY DISAPPEARED OR SOME NEW ROCKS APPEARED OUT OF THIN AIR IN SUCH A UNIVERSE THE INTEGERS WOULD BE LESS USEFUL AS A PHYSICAL MODEL

I THINK THIS MATHEMATICAL MODEL VIEWPOINT MIGHT CLEAR UP ANY CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT A NUMBER IS AND IN WHAT SENSE THEY ACTUALLY EXIST OR DO NOT EXIST
IT SEEMS MORE APPROPRIATE TO SAY THAT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE WORLD OR MORE PRECISELY ALL THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE GROUNDED IN MATHEMATICS MATHEMATICS HAS LOGICAL PRIORITY OVER PHYSICS
BEFORE I EVEN BEGIN TO READ THE ARTICLE I'M GREETED WITH A QUOTE THAT SOME PHILOSOPHERS DON'T THINK MATH EXISTS

SOME PHILOSOPHERS DO NOT COMPREHEND OR KNOW WHAT MATH IS HETP APPARENTLY

IF YOU CAN DRIVE A CAR YOU HAVE TO LEARN MATHEMATICS IF A CHILD MAKES A CAKE THEY ARE USING MATHEMATICS WHEN YOU PAY TAXES YOU ARE DOING MATHEMATICS SERIOUSLY

ARCHITECTS AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS USE IT TO PREVENT COLLAPSE AND COLLISION FOR INSTANCE
WHY ARE PEOPLE OBSESSED WITH FINDING AN INHERENT HIGHER MEANING TO MATH
HERE'S WHAT I'VE RARELY SEEN ADDRESSED

MATH SYSTEMS ARE ONLY USEFUL TO THE EXTENT THEY SHARE ISOMORPHISMS WITH REALITY THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF MATHS THAT ARE POSSIBLE

EDIT MATH SYSTEMS ARE ONLY USEFUL TO SCIENCE TO THE EXTENT THEY SHARE ISOMORPHISMS WITH MEASUREMENTS OF COURSE ANY MATH SYSTEM CAN BE USEFUL TO UNDERSTAND OTHER MATH SYSTEMS MY POINT IS THAT MATH COMES AFTER SCIENCE TO DESCRIBE IT NOT BEFORE

2 CAN BE READ AS APPLE HORSE APPLE EATS HAPPY BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IN THE REAL WORLD SO WE DON'T SAY THAT YOU COULD BUILD A PERFECTLY GOOD MATHEMATICAL SYSTEM

LOOK AT GEOMETRY THERE ISN'T ONE GEOMETRY UNLIKE WHAT EUCLID THOUGHT AND INDEED MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WAS ONLY ONE UNTIL THEY REMOVED THE AXIOM THAT SEEMED RATHER DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS AND TRIED TO PROVE THAT AXIOM WAS A THEOREM THEN THEY DISCOVERED THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF GEOMETRIES THAT ARE PERFECTLY VALID AND PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE FOR DIFFERENT PARTS OF FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS

THE SAME WITH NEWTON VS PLANK VS EINSTEIN EACH HAS MATHEMATICS THAT WORKS IN CERTAIN REALMS OF THE UNIVERSE

THE REASON MATH SEEMS TO BE GROUNDED IN THE BEHAVIOR OF THE UNIVERSE IS THAT WE MAKE UP DIFFERENT KINDS OF MATH UNTIL WE FIND THE ONE THAT'S ISOMORPHIC TO THE UNIVERSE THEN WE DON'T TEACH THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK AND WE IGNORE THE ONES THAT NEVER EVEN CAME CLOSE

AND TO A LARGE EXTENT WE SIMPLIFY LOTS OF THE DESCRIPTIONS OF REALITY TO MATCH THE MATH WE HAVE FOR IT HOW MANY COLLEGE CHEMISTRY STUDENTS COULD EXPLAIN IN TERMS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS WHY THE PERIODIC TABLE IS ARRANGED AS IT IS WE JUST DON'T TEACH THAT BECAUSE WE SAY THAT'S HOW IT IS AND HERE'S MATH THAT WORKS IF YOU ACCEPT THAT WITHOUT EXPLAINING WHY THAT ABSTRACTION OF THE QM WORKS THE WAY IT DOES

ANYONE WHO HAS EVER PROVED THAT 2 KNOWS THAT THE THINGS YOU FIND WITH MATHEMATICAL ABSTRACTIONS HOLD ONLY A TENUOUS RELATIONSHIP TO REALITY LET ALONE PROVING SOMETHING LIKE PRIME NUMBERS CANNOT BE ARRANGED IN A RECTANGLE USING ONLY FORMAL MANIPULATIONS
NO WONDER I SUCK AT RELATIONSHIPS
AS A MATHEMATICIAN MOST COMMENTS IN THIS THREAD MAKE ME WANT TO THROW UP
THE SCHOLASTICS THE ARISTOTELIAN CATHOLIC PHILOSOPHERS OF THE MIDDLE AGES WERE SO IMPRESSED WITH THE MIND S GRASP OF NECESSARY TRUTHS AS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE INTELLECT WAS IMMATERIAL AND IMMORTAL IF TODAY S NATURALISTS DO NOT WISH TO AGREE WITH THAT THERE IS A CHALLENGE FOR THEM DON T TELL ME SHOW ME BUILD AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM THAT IMITATES GENUINE MATHEMATICAL INSIGHT THERE SEEM TO BE NO PROMISING PLANS ON THE DRAWING BOARD

THE THING IS THAT FROM THE MATHEMATICIAN'S PERSPECTIVE AND I'M TALKING ABOUT MATHEMATICIANS FROM PH D S DOWN TO THE LEARNING TO UNDERSTAND A SIMPLER RELATION WE OFTEN DO APPROACH IT AS SORT OF A GAME OF SEMANTICS WE GET PERFECTLY WELL HOW TO UNDERSTAND THINGS AS BEING TRUE IN VIRTUE OF THEIR MEANING AND THAT'S MORE OR LESS HOW WE FIRST START TACKLING NECESSARY TRUTHS BORROWING THE ANALOGY OF THE AGAIN IT'S EASY TO GET THAT HARRY IS TALLER THAN BRAD BECAUSE EITHER WE GET THAT FEET IS GREATER THAN FEET TAKING A SIMPLIFIED NOTION OF NUMBERS HERE AND ALLOWING THE VERSION OF SOMETHING LIKE IS THE NEXT NUMBER UP FROM OR IF WE'RE COMPARING VISUALLY WE GET THAT TO BE TALLER MEANS THAT THE TOP OF HEAD TERMINATES AT A POINT HIGHER THAN WHEN THEY STAND ON THE SAME LEVEL PLANE IT MAY BE FAIR TO SUGGEST THAT MATHEMATICAL REALITY DOES NOT EXIST IN A REALM APART FROM OURS BUT THIS IS NOT IMMEDIATELY WHY WE ARE ABLE TO TACKLE IT WITH WHAT SEEMS LIKE UNUSUALLY ADEPT INTUITION

AS HAS BEEN SAID IN THIS THREAD ALREADY THOUGH THIS ARTICLE REALLY MISSES THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS THAT HAVE NO IMMEDIATE BASIS IN REALITY THINK EVEN OF THOSE FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS COURSES WHERE STUDENTS ARE ASKED TO CONSTRUCT THEIR OWN BASIC AXIOMATIC SYSTEM AND DEVISE PROOFS OF THEOREMS EASILY DERIVED FROM THE AXIOMS EVEN IF THE CONCEPTS THOSE STUDENTS EXPOSE EVENTUALLY DO CONNECT UP TO REALITY THAT IS HARDLY THE FIRST THING ON THE STUDENT'S MIND WHEN THEY START CONSTRUCTING THE BASIC SETUP AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN STILL FLESH OUT THOSE SYSTEMS WITHOUT A NEED TO CONSULT THOSE CONNECTIONS PROVIDES SOME INITIAL SUPPORT TO THE ARGUMENT AGAINST FRANKLIN HERE

EDIT MARKUP FIX
CONVENTIONALLY MAYBE SO ULTIMATELY NUMBER ULTIMATELY THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP IT IS A UNIFIED FIELD OF INTERCONNECTED UNITY RELATIONSHIP IMPLIES BOUNDARIES AND SEPARATION
ONLY FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW OF COURSE MATHS RELIES ON THE NOTION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTS THAT ONLY EXISTS IN OUR PLANE OF OBSERVATION MATHS IS THE LANGUAGE WE USE TO DESCRIBE AND CORRELATE THE WAY WE LIKE TO SEPARATE MATTER INTO LENGTH SIZE AND TIME
UNIVERSE IS SIMULATION IF ITS ACTUAL COMPUTER RUNNING VIRTUAL WORLD AND WE ARE CODE OR SOME OTHER CONSTRUCTION FOR EXAMPLE WORLD CREATED BY SOME GODLIKE POWER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE

THE POINT IS THAT TO CREATE THIS SIMULATION THERE MUST BE UNDERLYING LOGIC TO CREATE CODE ON WHATEVER THIS CODE IS

MATHEMATICS IS THIS UNDERLYING LOGIC ITS ALWAYS PRESENT IN BACKGROUND AND IT MUST BE SINCE WITHOUT IT THE CODE WILL FALL APART

THIS LOGIC IS EVER PRESENT AND ACTUALLY NOT VERY HARD TO DETECT AND IS ALWAYS TRUE IN ANY UNIVERSE OR FOR ANY BEING
I CAN IMAGINE THAT OUR MATH WOULD LOOK A LOT DIFFERENT OR PERHAPS WOULD HAVE PROGRESSED VERY DIFFERENTLY IF WE WERE IN A UNIVERSE WHERE THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THINGS WERE FUZZY ENOUGH THAT YOU COULDN'T REALISTICALLY COUNT THEM THAT GROUNDS MATH TO OUR PHYSICAL REALITY PRETTY WELL DOESN'T IT WHAT IS THE POINT IN DWELLING DEEPLY ON WHAT SUCH ALIEN UNIVERSES WOULD LOOK LIKE OR WHAT KIND OF MATH WOULD EXIST IN THEM WASN'T FLATLAND ABSTRACT ENOUGH
MATHS SEEMS TO STUDY THE WAY THINGS CAN BE OCCASIONALLY A PARTICULAR WAY THINGS CAN BE IS DAMN CLOSE TO THE WAY THINGS ARE BUT NEVER COMPLETELY I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS A SITUATION WHERE THE PERFECT WORLD OF MATHS ACTUALLY CAPTURES THE EXACT NATURE OF REALITY THERE ARE ALWAYS SOME ASSUMPTIONS MADE UPON THE PHYSICAL WORLD TO MAKE IT FIT THE MODEL EVEN JUST THINKING OF UNITS YOU CAN'T REALLY FIND A UNIT IN THE REAL WORLD WITHOUT USING SOME HIGHER ORDER HUMAN AND FLEXIBLE DEFINITION OF A THING
MATH LIKE LANGUAGE AND LIKE MUSIC IS A TOOL OF THOUGHT BEFORE ALL ELSE IT'S A WAY TO LITERALIZE LITERALLY SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES WITH PROPORTIONS AND RATIOS AND TRUTH WHICH CAN SEEM QUITE NEBULOUS UNTIL PUT ON A RIGOROUS FRAMEWORK

JUST MAKING ONE SYMBOL WRITTEN OR SPOKEN MEAN MORE THAN THING IS A EXERCISE IN SEMANTICS AKIN TO ANY LINGUISTIC PHENOMENON

MATHEMATICS IS BOUNDED IN PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE SENSE THAT THE FIELDS MATHEMATICS DEVELOPED OUT OF A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND AND DEAL WITH THE PHYSICAL WORLD GEOMETRY GREW OUT OF A NEED TO RESURVEY FEATURELESS LAND AFTER THE NILE FLOODING HAD RECEDED ARITHMETIC DEVELOPED OUT OF THE NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF THINGS SHEEP LOAVES OF BREAD BASKETS OF GRAIN

IT WAS ONLY AFTER PHYSICAL NECESSITY BROUGHT THE MATHEMATICS FORTH THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS WERE LOOKED AT
I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF IS A NATURAL NUMBER
NOT REALLY YOU CAN MAKE DIMENSIONS WITH MATH THAT DOESN'T MEAN DIMENSIONS EXIST THAT'S LIKE SAYING A DICTIONARY PERFECTLY DESCRIBES THE PHYSICAL WORD
LIKE ONE GIANT CATEGORY ERROR
I READ THE ARTICLE AND ASKS IS MATH ABOUT SOMETHING I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT BEFORE BUT I GUESS MATH IS A THING I'M NOT SURE IF A THING IS THE SAME THING AS SOMETHING THOUGH THE PREFIX SOME MUST BE QUANTITATIVE AFTER ALL THIS IS MATHS

WHY IS THIS QUESTION IMPORTANT


OK SO APPARENTLY THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT WHEN DEALING WITH MATHS AND USING MATHS I CAN BE SURE THAT THESE CORRESPOND TO TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS

IS MATH SOMETHING

NUMBER THE SCHOOL OF NOMINALISM MATH IS LANGUAGE PEOPLE INVENTED MATHEMATICS

2 YES THE SCHOOL OF PLATONISM MATH IS A FRAMEWORK MATH OCCURS IN NATURE

AFTER READING THE ARTICLE AND NOT UNDERSTANDING CARING ABOUT WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS YAKKING ON ABOUT I SCROLLED BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE PAGE AND I SAW SOME EGGS

THE EGGS SAID THIS SOME PHILOSOPHERS THINK MATHS EXISTS IN A MYSTERIOUS OTHER REALM THEY RE WRONG LOOK AROUND YOU CAN SEE IT

YEAH I TOTALLY SEE IT SO WHY ARE THESE OTHER OTHER PHILOSOPHERS SO STUPID

I HOPE THE MATHEMATICIANS ARE MADE AWARE OF THE SITUATION






INTUITION IT SEEMS A POORI THAT RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT PHYSICAL ONE CANNOT LOCATE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES MERELY DESCRIBE IT SO THEN MATHEMATICAL TRUTHS CANNOT BE BASED ON PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS OF SORT WHICH ARE MERE DESCRIPTIONS
OKAY I KNOW THE MATHS MATH GRIPE IS DONE TO DEATH BUT IF YOU INSIST ON SAYING MATHS LIKE IT'S PLURAL THEN WHY WOULD YOU SAY MATHS EXISTS IN A MYSTERIOUS OTHER REALM AND NOT MATHS EXIST IN A MYSTERIOUS OTHER REALM
IN OUR MODEL OF THE WORLD
PROBABLY MORE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT SOME FUNDAMENTAL MATHEMATICS IS ISOMORPHIC TO SOME FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE WORLD BUT NEITHER IS GROUNDED IS IN THE OTHER
DOESN'T THE MYTH OF THE CAVERN IMPLIES THAT IDEAS HAVE CAUSAL POWER OVER THE WORLD SINCE OBJECTS IN THE WORLD ARE SHADOWS CASTED BY OBJECTS IN THE WORLD OF IDEAS
I FEEL LIKE ONCE U APPLY MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE IN THE REAL WORLD AND GO SO FAR AT ONE POINT U TAKE IT UP TO YOURSELF TO EXPRESS IT IN PHILOSOPHY ON THE SUBJECT OF COSMOLOGY AT SOME POINT MANY SERIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL TOPICS COME UP BECAUSE WELL ITS INCOMPLETE POSSIBLY
THAT IS A FUNDAMENTALLY INCORRECT UNDERSTANDING OF MATHEMATICS MATHEMATICS IS BASED ON LOGICALLY INFERENCES OF A SET OF AXIOMS THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY RELATED TO OR ABSTRACTED FROM ANYTHING IN THE REAL WORLD IT IS INDEED THE DISCONTINUITY BETWEEN MATHEMATICS AND REAL WORLD OBJECTS THAT FREES MATHEMATICALLY INFERENCES FROM THE LIMITATION OF PHILOSOPHICAL CORRECTNESS
DELETED
OK I'M NOT A MATH PERSON I CAN RELATE TO SOME CONCEPTS RELATING TO WHAT I CAN SEE AND I RELUCTANTLY ADMIT THAT IRRATIONAL NUMBERS HAVE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS BUT I ONCE SAW A VIDEO OF A GUY EXPLAINING THAT THE SUM OF ALL NATURAL NUMBERS WAS EQUAL TO COULD SOME MATH PERSON GIVE AN EXAMPLE WHERE THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND NOT JUST A LANGUAGE TO TALK ABOUT AXIOMS AND RULES
IN RETROSPECT THE MATHS I STUDIED AT UNIVERSITY FOR MY ENGINEERING DEGREE HAD AN OVERALL AIM OF GETTING US TO HANDLE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS THEY DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THAT NEVER MIND WHY IT TAKES A HELLUVA LOT OF APPARENTLY POINTLESS CALCULUS STUDY TO GET TO THAT POINT IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER THAT I REALISED HOW FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS ARE TO THE REAL WORLD

FOR EXAMPLE EQUATION 2 ON THIS PAGE DESCRIBES DAMPED HARMONIC OSCILLATION WHERE DAMPED HARMONIC OSCILLATION MEANS PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT A HAS MASS AND B MOVES GUITAR STRINGS SUSPENSION BRIDGES CARS EXERCISE MACHINES IN GYMS ME OUT FOR A WALK THAT EQUATION COVERS IT

THE EQUATION AS STATED IS ABSTRACT OR HIGH LEVEL AND DOESN'T GIVE RESULTS DIRECTLY YOU HAVE TO SUPPLY INITIAL CONDITIONS AND RESTRAINTS THEN USE CALCULUS TO SOLVE THE EQUATION IN TO A FORM THAT CAN TAKE AND GIVE NUMBERS THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE REMAINDER OF THAT PAGE IT ALSO WOULDN'T APPLY DIRECTLY TO EAST G A WHOLE CAR YOU HAVE TO BREAK BIG PROBLEMS DOWN IN TO SMALLER ONES ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT THE EQUATIONS YOU GET CAN BE USABLE ON THEIR OWN AND YOU MAY HAVE USED THEM DIRECTLY

NOTHING IN THAT EQUATION HINTS AT THE KIND OF RESULTS YOU GET THERE IS NO SUGGESTION OF OSCILLATION THERE BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU GET IF THAT'S THE PROBLEM YOU'RE SOLVING NO EXPONENTIAL COMPONENT TO START WITH BUT WITH THE DAMPING TERM THAT'S WHAT COMES OUT AS A RESULT OF THE CALCULUS TECHNIQUES YOU HAVE TO USE AND THE RESULTS SOMEHOW MATCH REALITY THE AMPLITUDE VOLUME OF A GUITAR STRING REALLY DOES TAPER OFF EXPONENTIALLY OVER TIME IT'S A KIND OF MAGIC
THERE IS A SLIGHT ERROR IN THE ARTICLE

IMAGINE SIX CROSSES ARRANGED IN TWO ROWS OF THREE CROSSES EACH ONE ROW DIRECTLY ABOVE THE OTHER I CAN EQUALLY IMAGINE THE SAME SIX CROSSES AS THREE COLUMNS OF TWO EACH THEREFORE 2 2

I GET WHAT HE IS TRYING TO SAY HERE BUT THE TWO ARRANGEMENT DESCRIBED ARE IDENTICAL I'M ASSUMING COLUMNS SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH ROWS

OR DID I MISUNDERSTAND SOMETHING


MATH IS THE LANGUAGE OF GOD
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF WHERE THE PRAGMATISTS HAVE TACKLED PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THEY UNDERSTAND IT I ASSUME THEY WOULD TYPICALLY BE ARISTOTELIAN REALISTS BUT NOMINALISM MIGHT FIT WITH SOME PRAGMATISM
I JUST THOUGHT I WAS A BIT SLOW NOW I KNOW IT
EXCEPT CALCULUS

PHYSICS IS LITERALLY DESCRIBING THE PHYSICAL WORLD WITH MATHEMATICAL TOOLS I WOULD KNOW I HAVE A DEGREE IN THIS SHIT
THE REALITY IS MATH ISN'T GROUNDED IN ANYTHING SINCE WE ARE THE ONE THAT GIVE MATH SYMBOLS MEANING IF I DRAW A IN THE SAND USING DECIMAL NOTATION OR ROMAN NUMERALS WOULD SOME OTHER ALIEN CULTURE BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS MATHEMATICAL

AKA THE IDEA THAT MATH IS UNIVERSAL AS WE UNDERSTAND IS JUST OUR HUBRIS OF BEING BACKWARD APES THAT HAS NEVER MET ANYTHING RADICALLY FOREIGN TO OUR OWN THOUGHT PROCESSES GIVEN HOW LITTLE OF THE ACTUAL UNIVERSE WE'VE DISCOVERED AND ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY SEARCHED I'D BE HESITANT TO MAKE BOLD CLAIMS MATH IS A COGNITIVE DEVICE WE USE TO WRAP AROUND A COMPLEX OF PROCESSES THAT ARE IN NO WAY MATHEMATICAL WE ARE ASCRIBING SOMETHING TO PROCESSES VIA MATH THAT AREN'T THERE RATHER MATH HELPS US DEAL WITH AND DESCRIBE STRUCTURES BUT THERE IS A POINT WHERE OUR MATH FAILS BECAUSE OUR MATH MUST ULTIMATELY BE BASED ON SOUND OBSERVATIONAL CONCEPTS THAT USUALLY PRECEDE ANY NUMERICAL CONCEPTUALISATION AT ALL
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MATHS SURELY IS WE WOULD NOT EVER HAVE THOUGHT OF INFINITY WITHOUT FIRST GRASPING THE CONCEPT OF QUANTITY AND CONSIDERING THAT QUANTITIES MAY BE DIFFERENT OR CHANGE ANY CONCEPTS THAT GO BEYOND WHAT WE CAN EXPERIENCE AND ARE YET PROVEN TO BE VIABLE BY THINKING ABOUT THEM SURELY OWE THAT VIABILITY TO THE BUILDING BLOCKS ON WHICH OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THEM ARE BASED AND ARE THEREFORE SOMEHOW DEPENDENT ON WHAT WE CAN EXPERIENCE SPECULATION BEYOND THIS MIGHT BE FUTILE FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT SPECULATION ABOUT OTHER METAPHYSICAL THINGS IS WE CAN NEVER KNOW OR UNDERSTAND BY DEFINITION
MATHEMATICS IS THE BEST THING TO EVER COME OUT OF BOHEMIA
KINEMATICS IN 3D CARTESIAN SPACE IS FASCINATING SOMEHOW SIMPLY BY MOVING FROM ONE POINT IN 3D SPACE TO ANOTHER A MATHEMATICAL MAPPING FUNCTION POPS OUT THAT IS AND HAS BEHAVIOR THAT REMAINS UNKNOWN TO THIS DAY AND IS PRESENT ALL AROUND US FROM PREDATOR PREY BEHAVIOR TO WEATHER PATTERNS AND EVEN ECONOMICS
REMOVED
MATHEMATICS IS MERELY A SUBSET OF LOGIC LOGIC IS BASED ON OBJECTS AND THEIR INTERACTION

I'D SAY MATHEMATICS BECOMES IT'S REAL FORM WHEN WE GET TO ALGEBRA
REMOVED
I WOULD POSIT THAT MATHEMATICS AS A DISTILLATION OF LOGIC COULD EXIST IN A WORLD THAT DOES NOT OBEY ANY FORM OF LOGIC WE MAKE UP THE RULES THEN SEE WHAT FOLLOWS THEREFORE IT STRIKES ME THAT THE APPARENTLY APPLICABILITY OF MATHEMATICS OR LOGIC TO THE REAL WORLD IS COINCIDENTAL
MATHEMATICS IS THE ATTEMPT TO ORGANIZE AND GROUP THE LOGICAL SHORTCUTS IN OUR PHYSICAL WORLD
THE QUESTION OF HOW TO MAKE BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF DIFFERENT ANIMAL SPECIES IS VERY IMPORTANT HOWEVER I DON'T THINK IT MAKES MUCH SENSE TO INCLUDE ABSTRACT NATURAL ENTITIES LIKE ECOSYSTEMS OR BIODIVERSITY IN OUR CIRCLE OF CONCERN SINCE THEY HAVE NO INTERESTS OR SENTIENCE
LIFE IS BUT A VISION A DREAM
IS THIS HOW LATIN WAS SPOKEN BY A NATIVE SPEAKER OR IS THIS OUR BEST GUESS IN MODERN TIMES AS TO HOW THE INFLECTION TONE ACCENT WOULD HAVE MOSTLY LIKELY SOUNDED
THE DIRECTORS
THIS PAPER CONSIDERS THE POSSIBILITY OF BENTHAM HAVING HAD A CONDITION THAT IS TODAY SUBSUMED INTO THE DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDER
WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THAT PETER VIEWS ARE OFTEN DESCRIBED AS NARROW OVERLY SYSTEMATIC BLIND TO EMOTIONAL TRUTHS TEXTBOOK DESCRIPTIONS OF AUTISM IN FACT PEOPLE USE THE WORD AUTISTIC TO DESCRIBE IDEAS


I'M A UTILITARIAN AND I'M ALSO A LITTLE SPECTRUM
THE LINK DOES NOT WORK FOR ME

EDIT OKAY THE SERVERS JUST SEEM A BIT SLOW AND IT'S A PDF
AS SOMEONE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH INFORMATION AND CODING THEORY FROM AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING BACKGROUND I WASN'T A FAN

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE FREELY AVAILABLE INFORMATION THEORY INFERENCE AND LEARNING ALGORITHMS BY DAVID MACKAY IT COVERS EVERYTHING IN THE VIDEO AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AND IS VERY READABLE EVEN AT A PRE-TERTIARY LEVEL OF MATHEMATICS

WITHIN 2 MINUTES THEY HAD ALREADY CONFLATED WEIGHT AND MASSACHUSETTS HOW MANY MORE FUNDAMENTAL MISTAKES DOES IT CONTAIN
YOU PROBABLY WILL NOT LIKE THIS


I FIRST LOOKED AT YOUR TITLE AND THEN THE BIBLIOGRAPHY AND I NOTICED THAT YOU DO NOT MENTION QUINE BARSKY OR DAVIDSON ANY ACCOUNT OF NECESSITY AND PROPOSITIONS SHOULD MENTION TWO DOGMAS OF EMPIRICISM I NEXT LOOKED BRIEFLY AT YOUR CHAPTER PROPOSITION AND MEANING AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE REINVENTING THE WHEEL THAT DAVIDSON CONSTRUCTED USING TRUTH THEORETIC SEMANTICS

IF YOU POST A SUMMARY I MIGHT BE INCLINED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK BUT RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR PROJECT IS FAILING TO ENGAGE REALLY IMPORTANT LITERATURE ON THE SUBJECT
SLOW DOWN AND START THINKING OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS WE SHOULD NOT IN TERMS OF WHAT IT S LIKE

THE FACT THAT WHAT IT'S LIKE EVEN EXISTS IS THE WHOLE HARD PROBLEM

WITH WHAT IT'S LIKE RULED OUT OF COURT HACKER PROCEEDS TO START THINKING OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS WE SHOULD HE EXPLAINS CONSCIOUS BEHAVIOR INSTEAD OF CONSCIOUS NESS THE USUAL BAIT AND SWITCH



FROM THE OPENING PARAGRAPHS

PHILOSOPHY DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD WE LIVE IN AFTER THE MANNER OF ANY OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES YOU CAN ASK ANY SCIENTIST TO SHOW YOU THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF SCIENCE OVER THE PAST MILLENNIUM AND THEY HAVE MUCH TO SHOW LIBRARIES FULL OF WELL-ESTABLISHED FACTS AND WELL CONFIRMED THEORIES IF YOU ASK A PHILOSOPHER TO PRODUCE A HANDBOOK OF WELL-ESTABLISHED AND UNCHALLENGEABLE PHILOSOPHICAL TRUTHS THERE S NOTHING TO SHOW I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE PHILOSOPHY IS NOT A QUEST FOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE WORLD BUT RATHER A QUEST FOR UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPTUAL SCHEME IN TERMS OF WHICH WE CONCEIVE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WE ACHIEVE ABOUT THE WORLD ONE OF THE REWARDS OF DOING PHILOSOPHY IS A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT OURSELVES AND ABOUT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN NOT FRESH FACTS ABOUT REALITY
REALLY ENJOYED THE INTERVIEW ALSO REFLECTED SOME OF MY FRUSTRATION AT NOT REALLY GRASPING WHAT IS USEFUL ABOUT CONCEIVING OF A HARD PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM I'VE TRIED BUT I STILL DON'T SEE ONE SO IT PERPLEXES ME THAT SO MANY PEOPLE SUPPOSEDLY DO
BUT ONCE YOU HAVE ANSWERED THE HOW AND THE WHY OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY AH EXCLAIM
CHALMERS NAGEL AND OTHERS YOU STILL HAVE NOT TOLD US WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE A BAT OR A HUMAN BEING OR A
ZOMBIE SO THERE BUT WHAT IT IS LIKE IS AN EXPERIENCE WHICH MEANS THAT IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ASK HOW AND
WHY IT IS POSSIBLE IN ANY OTHER SENSES BUT THE ONES JUST DISCUSSED OF COURSE AN EXPLANATION ISN T THE SAME AS
AN EXPERIENCE BUT THAT S BECAUSE THE TWO ARE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT CATEGORIES LIKE COLORS AND TRIANGLES IT
IS OBVIOUS THAT I CANNOT EXPERIENCE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE YOU BUT I CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE A COMPLETE
EXPLANATION OF HOW AND WHY IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE YOU TO ASK FOR THAT EXPLANATION TO ALSO SOMEHOW ENCOMPASS
THE EXPERIENCE ITSELF IS BOTH INCOHERENT AND AN ILLEGITIMATE USE OF THE WORD EXPLANATION

THIS PIECE IS TOO SHORT TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANS BY THIS BUT FOR THE EXPLANATION TO NOT INCLUDE HOW THE EXPERIENCE CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF THE BIOLOGY IS JUST TO MISS THE HARD PROBLEM ALL TOGETHER IS IT NOT HE HAS TO SAY MORE ABOUT WHY CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF ISN'T INCLUDED IN THE EXPLANATION AFTER ALL IT IS THE TARGET WOULD NOT HAVING CONSCIOUSNESS INCLUDED IN THE EXPLANATION BE LIKE TRYING TO EXPLAIN GRAVITY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO MASS
ISN'T HE JUST BEGGING THE QUESTION HERE BY INSISTING THAT THE HOW OF PHENOMENAL CONSCIOUSNESS IS A QUESTION FOR COGNITIVE SCIENCE NEUROBIOLOGY AND THE LIKE

HE SEEMS TO TAKE THIS AS A SELF-EVIDENT PROPOSITION IN CONTEXT BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE THE LOCUS OF THE ENTIRE NEUROBIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION CAN PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE IS THE HARD PROBLEM SO HE CAN'T GET AWAY WITH JUST ASSERTING THAT IT OBVIOUSLY CAN

I'M ALSO NOT SURE WHAT PIGLIUCCI MEANS BY AN EXPLANATION ENCOMPASS ING THE EXPERIENCE ITSELF PRESUMABLY AN EXPLANATION OF THE MECHANICS OF SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE WOULD LITERALLY GIVE US A WAY TO EXPERIENCE THINGS EXACTLY LIKE ANOTHER PERSON IF WE HAD THE CORRECT TOOLS BUT PIGLIUCCI SAYS THAT IT'S OBVIOUS THAT ONE CANNOT EXPERIENCE THINGS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT SORT OF IDEA IS SUPPOSED TO BE INCOHERENT HERE
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE HARD PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND PEOPLE WHO CAN'T
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE EXAMPLE WITH THE VR GAME SOMETHING LIKE THAT WAS MOST PROBABLY ADVERTISED AS A SCARY EXPERIENCE SO WHEN SOMETHING SCARY HAPPENS IN A SCARY EXPERIENCE IT SHOULDN'T BE SEEN AS ETHICALLY WRONG IT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM IF IT WAS ADVERTISED AS SOMETHING CALM AND PLEASANT BUT THEN IT'S AN ETHICS IN ADVERTISING PROBLEM NOT AN ETHICS IN DESIGN PROBLEM
DESIGNERS CAN BE AS ETHICAL AS THEY WANT UNTIL THEY HAVE TO PAY THE BILLS AND THE CLIENT WANTS SOMETHING ELSE IT'S COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC TO PUT ALL THIS ON THE DESIGNER IT'S THE CLIENTS THAT NEED THE MOTIVATION
WHAT IS THIS GUY TRYING TO SAY WHAT WAS THE VR GAME SUPPOSE TO SHOW HOW WAS IT UNETHICAL TO MAKE A SCARY VR GAME THE WHOLE ARTICLE SEEMED RATHER VAGUE TO ME WHAT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE DESIGN WORLD DOES HE FIND UNETHICAL
I WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED THAT IT SEEMS TO BECOME COMMON PRACTICE TO HAVE ETHICS COURSES FOR ANY TYPES OF ENGINEERS AND THE LIKES IN UNIVERSITY THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE MOST PRONE TO INVENT ADVANCE AND BUILD THINGS THAT MIGHT BE ETHICALLY QUESTIONABLE
I GET A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN THERE IS A CALL FOR ETHICS HE CLAIMS IN HIS ARTICLE THAT ETHICS ARE NOT A UNIVERSAL TRUTH BUT INSTEAD BRED OUT OF THE ACT OF MAKING CONSCIOUS DELIBERATE DECISIONS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MANY OF THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE AT PLAY IN THE ARENA THAT ONE IS DECIDING UPON

WHO IS HE TO CLAIM THAT THE PEOPLE HE IS CRITICIZING HAVEN'T DONE THESE THINGS AND NOT MERELY ARRIVED AT A DIFFERENT ETHICAL CONCLUSION HE RANGES FROM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS TO BEING SCARED BY A VR GAME HE DOESN'T SEEM TO EVEN GIVE EXAMPLES OF HOW TO ADDRESS ANY OF THESE ETHICAL ISSUES

HE'S MAKING AN APPEAL NOT FOR INCREASED ETHICS IN DESIGN BUT INSTEAD FOR ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT AGREE WITH HIS NOTIONS
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IS THAT DESIGNERS ARE PASSING THE BUCK OR THAT SOMETIMES THEY ACTUALLY CAN'T DESIGN THE WAY THEY WANT I AM A USER RESEARCHER AND I HAVE VERY STRONG ETHICAL RESEARCH PRINCIPLES MY RESULTS HELP GUIDE DESIGN BUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN I HAVE TO FIGHT WITH MY BOSS ON HOW I CAN'T CHANGE WHAT THE RESULTS SAY HE WANTS ME TO REWORD IT SO IT'S EASILY MISLEADING OR MISINTERPRETED THE NEXT PROJECT COMES AROUND AND I'M OFF THE PROJECT I KEEP FIGHTING BUT ITS BEGINNING TO HURT MY CAREER BECAUSE I DON'T GET TO DO MY JOB AS OFTEN AS I WOULD IF I JUST WANT HE WANTED
I BELIEVE SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR WHEN THEY SAW THE FIRST STEAM TRAIN GOING SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN A HORSE BONES WOULD RATTLE AND BRAINS WOULD DISLODGE FROM THEIR GOD-GIVEN SKULLS ETC
ETHICALLY SPEAKING IT'S WRONG OF US TO PLAY GAMES WHILE MILLIONS DIE EVERY DAY IN WAR RELATED STARVATION DISEASE AROUND THE WORLD

THIS IS EASILY ANSWERED YES

I HAVE STUDIED PRODUCT DESIGN AND THEN ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITY GO HAND IN HAND AND IF NOT THEN YOU ARE A POOR DESIGNER IN MY OPINION

STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT ABOUT ETHICS SUSTAINABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN DESIGN INSTANCES I WOULD ALSO ARGUE EVEN IF THIS WAS NOT A TAUGHT ASPECT OF DESIGN A GOOD DESIGNER WOULD ENCOMPASS ALL OF THESE TRAITS INTO THEIR WORK THESE DAYS

THE ONLY INSTANCE WHERE I CAN THINK ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITY WOULD POSSIBLY NOT BE CONSIDERED WITHIN DESIGN IS WHEN WE ARE NOT DESIGNING FOR THE OF US EAST G WEAPON DESIGN HOWEVER EVEN THEN THERE IS SOMEWHAT SOME ETHICAL CONSIDERATION TAKEN INTO THE DESIGN OF WEAPONS IN AN OTHERWISE DESIGN FIELD BUT THIS IS SPECULATION AS I AM NOT EDUCATED IN WEAPON DESIGN

EDIT MY TERRIBLE GRAMMAR
I REMEMBER ONCE I LEFT THE OFFICE AND TOOK THE STAIRS AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS WERE SPIKES WHOEVER DESIGNED THAT BUILDING HASN'T STUDIED PHILOSOPHY IF THEY HAD THE STAIRS WOULD OF ENDED IN A ROOM WITH SHADOWS ON THE WALLS AND THEN THE REAL ESCAPE WOULD BEGIN
AS A DESIGNER I WONDER ABOUT THE AGENCY OF THE DESIGNER OFTEN HE STATES THAT WE HAVE POWER TO SHAPE SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND NORMS THOUGH I THINK MAYBE THE CART IS BEFORE THE HORSE IN THIS REGARD IN RETROSPECT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ARTIFACTS WE HOLD THE BELIEF THAT THESE ARTIFACTS REPRESENT SOME GREATER VALUE OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH IT WAS MADE WERE IT NOT SO WHY WOULD IT BE CREATED FOR EXAMPLE ARTISTIC AMPHORAE FROM GREECE OR THE MENHIRS OF CARNAC IN THE PRESENT DESIGN IS INTENDED IN PART TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF TODAY PRESUMABLY PROBLEMS THAT EXISTED BEFORE A DESIGN WAS CRAFTED AS THE SOLUTION OTHERWISE WE WOULD JUST BE THROWING EXCREMENT AGAINST A WALL TO SEE WHAT STICKS NOT AN ENTIRELY INVALID EXERCISE IN MY MIND PERHAPS THE EXTENT OF ETHICS FOR A DESIGNER SHOULD BE NOT TO CHALLENGE THOSE ETHICAL NORMS THAT ARE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY TO BE GOOD AND RIGHT FOR THE SOCIETY EVEN IF THE DESIGN WAS CREATED TO EXALT A NEW ETHICAL NORM FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDING ACCESSIBLE RAMPS AND ELEVATORS IN A BUILDING I DON'T THINK ITS RIGHT TO SUGGEST THAT THE DESIGN OR THE DESIGNER FOR THAT MATTER ARE THE WELLSPRING OF THE NEW ETHIC

EDIT I READ LEYLA AND ASSUMED WOMAN IS ACTUALLY A MAN SR
I DON'T THINK I COULD BE IN GREATER DISAGREEMENT WITH THIS ARTICLE OR AT LEAST WITH HOW THE AUTHOR IS WORDING THINGS
I SUBSCRIBED FOR THIS SUBREDDIT A FEW DAYS AGO AND A DESIGN ETHICS THREAD COMES UP THIS IS AWESOME

SO I AGREE THE VR EXAMPLE DISTRACTS MORE THAN IT ACTUALLY PROVES HIS POINT HE IS REALLY JUST DESCRIBING THE SAME EFFECTS PEOPLE HAD WHEN WATCHING THE FIRST LUMIERE FILM HOWEVER THE MAIN POINT I THINK HE IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT DESIGNERS DO NOT HAVE TO ADHERE TO A CODE OF ETHICS THE SAME AS ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS DO WHICH IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT AND SOMETHING THAT INDUSTRY AND COMPLETELY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

SO THE FIRST POINT DISCUSSIONS OF ETHICS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PART OF PAPANE A DESIGNER AND EDUCATOR WHO WROTE THE BOOK DESIGN FOR THE REAL WORLD WAS MADE FAMOUS FOR THE QUOTES

THERE ARE PROFESSIONS MORE HARMFUL THAN INDUSTRIAL DESIGN BUT ONLY A FEW OF THEM

I'M SURPRISED THIS HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED YET BUT IN A GROUP OF DESIGNERS WROTE AND THE FIRST THINGS FIRST MANIFESTO THIS MANIFESTO WAS MEANT TO BRING TO LIGHT THAT DESIGN HAS BECOME MORE CONCERNED WITH HELPING COMPANIES SELL THINGS THAN ACTUALLY CREATING THINGS THAT HELP PEOPLE AND SO THERE IS ALWAYS BEEN AN UNDERSTANDING THAT DESIGNERS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AND THE CONSCIOUS OR UNCONSCIOUS DECISIONS OF OUR WORK CAN AND HAVE HAD INCREDIBLY POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS THE AUTHOR IS RIGHT THE THAT S NOT MY PROBLEM EXCUSE DOESN'T CUT IT

THE SECOND POINT IS THAT YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT TRADITIONAL DESIGN IGNORING THE FACT THAT DESIGN AS A DISCIPLINE IS CHANGING I USED TO WORK AS A GRAPHIC DESIGNER NOW I WORK AS A SERVICE DESIGNER THIS MEANS THAT MY WORK IS MUCH MORE STRATEGIC AND SO THE DECISIONS I HAVE AN IMPACT ON ARE NO LONGER ATTACHED TO ARTIFACTS BUT TO ENTIRE SERVICE SYSTEMS THIS REALLY EXCITING AS A DESIGNER BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE A MORE PROFOUND IMPACT BUT ALSO DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES WE CAN HAVE MULTIPLIES ONE THING IS DESIGNING A NEW PACKAGING FOR A TOBACCO COMPANY TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE ANOTHER IS DESIGNING A NEW SERVICE TO MAKE THAT PURCHASE MORE ACCESSIBLE INCREASING THE NEGATIVE IMPACT SERVICES INHERENTLY ENABLE PEOPLE AND IF WE AS DESIGNERS WORK TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO DO THAT'S THAT ARE NEGATIVE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE ENVIRONMENT THEN THE RESULTS YEARS DOWN THE LINE COULD BE WORSE THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY
GOOD READ AND I ESSENTIALLY AGREE WITH THE FINAL PARAGRAPH


BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS

WHO GETS TO DECIDE WHAT WE END UP WITH AND WHAT IS NOT A GOOD COLLECTIVE DECISION TO INVEST IN

AND THE ANSWER IS CAPITALISTS MOSTLY

WHAT THAT MEANS IN REAL LIFE IN THE CUBICAL FARMS IS THAT IF YOU AS THE POXY DESIGNER ENGINEER WERE TO TRY AND INTRODUCE NEW REQUIREMENTS SUSTAINABILITY ECOLOGICAL SOURCING CONSTRAINTS SERVICEABILITY OR REPAIRABILITY FEATURES TO A PRODUCT DESIGN THAT IS NOT PART OF THE CONTRACTUALLY BINDING STATEMENT OF WORK HANDED DOWN TO YOU BY THE CUSTOMER OR BY MANAGEMENT THEN YOU WILL BE REPLACED WITH SOMEONE WHO WILLIAM

THAT'S THE REALITY

I MEAN DO WE EVEN WANT AI

HERE IS THE RUB SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE WORKING ON THIS CHOOSING TO UNILATERALLY DISARM JUST MEANS THAT IT WON'T BE YOU WHO FIGURES IT OUT IT WILL BE YOUR COMPETITOR

WE ARE CURRENTLY LOCKED INTO AN ARMS RACE TO DEVELOP THE MEANS OF OUR OWN OBSOLESCENCE AND THERE IS NO WAY TO STOP IT SHORT OF GLOBAL COLLAPSE INTO ANARCHY AND EVEN THEN THERE IS NO REASON TO ASSUME SOME ISOLATED WELL PROTECTED SELF SUFFICIENT OPERATION IS NOT STILL MARCHING TOWARD THE GOAL

OUR ONLY HOPE HERE SEEMS TO REST UPON THE BENEVOLENCE AND OR DISINTEREST THIS SAI WILL DISPLAY TOWARD OUR SPECIES AS IT GOES ABOUT IT'S BUSINESS WHATEVER IT DETERMINES THAT TO BE
IF THIS LINE OF THINKING WERE ACCEPTED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES WOULD NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DESIGN OF THEIR DRUGS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IT AFFECTED AFTER IT HAD BEEN EXCRETED FROM THE BODY AND HOW IT DECOMPOSED SAYING IT THAT WAY MAKES IT SEEM LIKE COMMON SENSE

IF YOU WERE UNAWARE THIS IS CURRENTLY NOT THE CASE THEY ARE ONLY HELD BY THE FDA UP UNTIL THE POINT IT IS EXCRETED FROM THE BODY
I CAN'T DESIGN YOU THAT CAKE YOU WANTED BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST MY PERSONAL RELIGIOUS BELIEFS POSTMODERN ETHICAL LENS

OK
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT THE WORLD WOULD BE LIKE IF WE STOPPED MAKINGNPARK BENCHES AND PUBLIC SPACES AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE HOMELESS PEOPLE FROM BEING THERE IF WE HOUSED THE HOMELESS AND DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CRAP LIKE THAT WE COULD MAKE OUR PARKS AS COMFY AS POSSIBLE HANGING GARDENS OUTDOOR BEANBAGS AGORA STYLE AMPHITHEATERS MAYBE INSTEAD OF THE PARKS BEING EMPTY AND SAD WE COULD HAVE PEOPLE CONGREGATE AND TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE SAY PHILOSOPHY LIKE THEY DID IN THE BEFORE TIMES
SO I'M SORT OF CONFUSED ON THE PREMISE OF THIS ARTICLE SOME PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING ON HIS AXE THROWING ANALOGY AND SPEAKING ON THE ETHICS OF THE USER EXPERIENCE

I THOUGHT HE MAY HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON THE HUMAN COST OF PRODUCING THESE EVER CHANGING DESIGNS AS THOUGH BRIDLING AND MANUFACTURING THESE INVENTIONS SHOULD HAVE ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AM I WRONG IN THAT PERCEPTION

ASSUMING THE AUTHOR WAS SPEAKING ON THE LATTER THAT DOES BRING UP A PROFOUND MODERN DAY PROBLEM WE RELY ON CELL PHONES AND ELECTRONICS TO GET OUT OUR MESSAGE ON VARIOUS SOCIAL JUSTICES YET THE CLOTHES WE WEAR AND THE ELECTRONICS WE USE HAVE HUGE ETHICAL ISSUES

PERHAPS ETHICAL ELECTRONIC MANUFACTURING CAN CREATE A NICHE AND A MOVEMENT LIKE FREE RANGE POULTRY OR HUMANE RAISED DAIRY AT FIRST I'D ASSUME THE COST WOULD BE PROBABLY SIGNIFICANT BUT THEN AGAIN WITH 3D PRINTING MAYBE DESIGNERS OWE IT TO US TO TRY HARDER TO RESOLVE ETHICAL ISSUES WHILE THEY TACKLE TECHNOLOGICAL ONES
THERE IS NO COLLECTIVE MORAL COMPASS AND THE DICHOTOMY OF RIGHT AND WRONG DIFFERS DRAMATICALLY ACROSS GENERATIONS CULTURES NATIONALITIES AND PROFESSIONALS

AS SOCIAL CREATURES I THINK OUR MORAL COMPASS IS VERY MUCH COLLECTIVE SOME OF IT IS MOST LIKELY GENETIC AND A LOT IS LEARNED BUT WE FEED OFF EACH OTHER FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG
I'VE GONE THROUGH TWO ENGINEERING COURSES IN THE MASTERS ONE MORE SO WE LEARNT ETHICAL DESIGN LIKE DFE DESIGN FOR ENVIRONMENT AND NOT SO ETHICAL DESIGN LIKE DAMA DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING ASSEMBLY WHICH IS ABOUT TAKING AWAY JOBS ESSENTIALLY INCREASING AUTOMATION

IF I WANTED TO GO DOWN THE SECOND ROAD I'VE BEEN EDUCATED ON THAT

ON THE OTHER HAND IF A SOLE ENGINEER IS DETERMINED IN PRODUCING A GOOD ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND PRODUCT THAT WILL ALWAYS BE TRUMPED BY COST HANDS ARE TIED

CONSUMERISM FUCKS EVERYTHING UP A PHONE LASTS A FEW YEARS NOW BECAUSE THE NEW INCREMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY ARE NOT NEEDED PEOPLE BUY LESS NOW SO COMPANIES ARE TRYING MAKE A PHONE A SERVICE NOW NEW PHONE EVERY MONTHS AIF YOU SIGN UP TO A MONTHLY PLAN THIS INCREASES UNNECESSARY OF THE RESOURCES THE MARKETING INDUSTRY IS THE MAIN DRIVER BEHIND THIS AND PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED THAT THIS IS WHAT'S RIGHT

NO EVERY PERSON HAS TO TAKE RESPONSIBLITY

I'VE JUST USED PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE USED BY THE TECH INDUSTRY AS A SMALL EXAMPLE FOR THIS MANY OTHER EXAMPLES CAN PROVE THIS POINT
ETHICS IN DESIGN SHOULD BE NOT PUTTING SPARK PLUGS BEHIND STEERING RODS
WHEN EVERYONE WITHIN A SYSTEM PLAYS THIS HANDS-OFF THAT S NOT MY PROBLEM GAME THE SYSTEM IS VERY QUICKLY RIDDLED WITH EXTERNAL ISSUES AND A SHIPLOAD OF PROBLEMS

I LIKE THIS SENTENCE
THIS IS A VERY CONFUSED CRITIQUE OF ETHICS AND ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY WITH AN AMAZING CONCLUSION THAT REALLY CRANKED THE HYPERBOLE TO MAX ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING WHAT WAS SPOKEN ABOUT IN THE REST OF THE ARTICLE AS TO THE AUTHOR'S ORIGINAL CONCERN I BELIEVE A SIMPLE DISCLAIMER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VR EXPERIENCE WOULD BE MORE THAN SATISFACTORY SOMETHING LIKE WHAT YOU SEE FOR THRILL RIDES OR OTHER EVENTS THAT MAY CAUSE PHYSICAL EXCITEMENT AND OR AGITATION AND EVEN THAT IS MORE A PRECAUTION IN A LITIGIOUS SOCIETY RATHER THAN AN ETHICAL CONCERN

PERHAPS EVEN MORE WORRYING TOWARDS THE END OF THIS ARTICLE THE WRITER EVEN SAYS THAT DOING NO HARM BEING GOOD TO YOUR CLIENT AND PROTECTING RIGHTS SUCH AS PRIVACY IS THE CURRENT ETHICAL STANDARD OF MANY ASSOCIATIONS AND THAT THEY ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH WHAT EXACTLY SHOULD BE ADDED THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS THAT YOU CAN'T AVOID ETHICS AT THIS POINT NOT ESPECIALLY HELPFUL WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE CURRENT ASSOCIATIONS CODE OF ETHICS EXACTLY IS IT ADDRESSING THE PERVERSE LEGAL STRUCTURES OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR SOMETHING ELSE HAVE WE GONE TO A CRITIQUE OF THE ETHICS OF VR INTERACTION TO A CRITIQUE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY INFO JUST LIKE THAT VERY CONFUSED

AS A SIDE NOTE IT'S WORRYING TO ME THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PIN ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY ON CREATORS RATHER THAN THEMSELVES THIS STRIKES ME AS THE STANDARD CALL OF MANY A MORAL MEDIA CRUSADER WHEN CONFRONTED WITH A NEW ENTERTAINMENT MEDIUM WHETHER IT WAS OPERA LITERATURE MOVIES TELEVISION OR VIDEO GAMES THE CERTAINLY NOT RANDOM NOSEDIVE INTO PROPRIETARY INFORMATION REASSURES ME THAT THIS PERSON'S LARGER POINT DOESN'T LIE IN VIDEO GAMES OR VR BUT IT CONCERNS ME THAT VIDEO GAMES ARE STILL THE FAIRGROUND FOR MEDIA CRUSADERS FORTY YEARS AFTER DEATH RACE
BUT HERE IS THE THING ABOUT ETHICS THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL TRUTH OR GOVERNING PARADIGM THAT DICTATES WHAT IS ETHICAL AND WHAT IS NOT

UGHHHHH I SWEAR I THOUGHT I FOUND THIS LINK IN R BADPHILOSOPHY AND HAD TO DOUBLE CHECK
THERE IS NO ETHICAL CAPITALISM
WELL NICE ARTICLE BUT WHAT ABOUT A MENTION ABOUT WHO CARES FOR US THE DESIGNERS YES ON THE ONE HAND I DO THINK WE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND AGEN IN THE OTHER HAND I AM THINKING WHY FOR WHO THE WORLD IS HAS SO MANY SELFISH AND SELF-ABSORBED PEOPLE I SHOULD JUST WORRY ABOUT MYSELF COLLECT THE CHECK AND GO HOME
ONLY INDIVIDUALS MAY MAKE ETHICAL DECISIONS

WITHIN GROUPS ONLY INDIVIDUALS WILL MAKE ALL GROUP ETHICAL DECISIONS

THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE ONE PERSON MADE ALL ETHICAL DECISIONS FOR ALL THE NAZIS AND MANY OTHERS FAILED AT THIS

WHO IS TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OUTCOMES EXTERNALITIES AND DOWNRIGHT DAMAGING IMPACTS OF OUR EVER-CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF NEW GADGETS AND VIRTUAL ARENAS THAT ARE COMING ON BOARD AT A PACE

SUMMARY
PART OF A PAIR IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO AGUSTIN AYO MIT TEACHES US ABOUT SOME WEIRD PROPERTIES OF INFINITY USING AN EXAMPLE DUE TO MATHEMATICIAN DAVID HILBERT CALLED HOTEL HE SHOWS US A RESULT PROVED BY ANOTHER MATHEMATICIAN GEORG CANTOR THAT MANY INFINITE COLLECTIONS OF THINGS ARE THE SAME SIZE THINGS THAT ARE THE SAME SIZE INCLUDE THE NATURAL NUMBERS THE NATURAL NUMBER PLUS ONE THE NATURAL NUMBERS PLUS THE NATURAL NUMBERS AND AS MANY COPIES OF THE NATURAL NUMBERS AS THERE ARE NATURAL NUMBERS AMAZING

IS IT TRUE THE UNIVERSE IS BIGGER THAN WE THINK BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEE IT ALL BECAUSE OF THE SPEED OF LIGHT MEANING THAT THERE IS LIGHT THAT WE CAN'T SEE BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH TIME HAS PAST FOR IT TO REACH US
HUMANS HAVE A HARD TIME GRASPING SOMETHING INCOMPREHENSIBLY LARGE WE ALWAYS DEAL WITH THE FINITE IN DAILY LIFE TO DEAL WITH THE OPPOSITE IS IMPOSSIBLE

THE UNIVERSE MAY HAVE INFINITE SIZE BUT TO PROVE IT WAS FINITE YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIND A PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE YOU COULD MEASURE IT FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER THE UNIVERSE APPEARS TO HAVE UNIFORMITY THAT IS FROM ANY LOCATION YOU LOOK IT ALL APPEARS TO BE THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE THEREFORE YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE IT ALL

I SUPPOSE THE OTHER EXPERIMENT YOU COULD RUN WOULD BE TO TRAVEL TO ONE END OF THE UNIVERSE TO THE OTHER AND THEN TRAVEL TO THE NORTHERNMOST POINT AND THEN THE SOUTHERNMOST THEN THE TOPMOST AND BOTTOMMOST BUT THIS IS AGAIN IMPOSSIBLE IF FROM EVERY POSITION IN THE UNIVERSE YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE
MY QUESTION WHERE IS SPACE EXPANDING WHERE IS IT GOING IF THERE WAS AN END TO SPACE WHAT WOULD COME AFTER

THERE'S SOMETHING SPACE AND THEN IT JUST TURNS INTO NOTHING I JUST CAN'T COMPREHEND LIFE SOMETIMES

EDIT DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE PODCAST YET
IF THERE IS NO ENDING WHOSE TO SAY THERE WAS A BEGINNING
THANKS FOR THAT IT'S TOO EASY TO MISS THINGS LIKE THIS ON THE RADIO INLAYER BUT THAT'S SOME MORE INSOMNIA TIME COVERED
SPOILER IT DOESN'T BUT IT EXPANDS AT SUCH A RATE THAT YOU'LL NEVER GET TO THE EDGE
BUT IF THE UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING THAT MEANS IT HAS LIMITS IF THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO EXPAND THAT MEANS ITS LIMITLESS THEREFORE INFINITE YOU FOLLOW
THIS QUESTION DOESN'T SEEM LIKE PHILOSOPHY AT ALL WHAT YOU ARGUE ABOUT IS NOT AT ALL GOING TO AFFECT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AS FAR AS WE KNOW SPACE GOES ON FOREVER AND THERE ARE INFINITELY MANY STARS AND WE CAN MEASURE ASTRONOMICAL THINGS THAT INDICATE THAT IS THE CASE WHY IS THIS A DEBATE WITHOUT EVIDENCE
IS THIS A PODCAST I CAN GET
BRILLIANT SERIES LOOKING FORWARD TO THE LAST EPISODE

COULDN'T GRASP ANY OF IT AFTER EPISODE 2 HOWEVER

SETS OF SETS OF SETS WTF
I JUST LISTENED TO AN INFINITE MONKEYS EPISODE ON NUMBERS ONE OF THE TEAM ASKED ABOUT INFINITY AT THE END AND THE PANEL STARTED ASKING WHAT KIND OF INFINITY DO YOU MEAN BLEW MY SMALL SMALL INFINITELY TINY BRAIN
GREAT WEBSITE
THANKS FOR THE LINK I HAVE THIS TO LISTEN LATER
CAN WE CREATE INFINITY
IF THE UNIVERSE IS ALL THAT IS THEN IT IS BY NATURE INFINITE
OLBERS PARADOX
I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND INFINITY
DDK IF IT FITS INTO PHILOSOPHY BUT I FIND IT MIND BLOWING THAT WE ARE NOT LIMITED IN WHAT WE CAN SEE BY DISTANCE BUT BY TIME IT'S SOMEWHAT DISTURBING TO REALIZE THAT DISTANCE IS TIME IN ALL THINGS THE ONLY REASON WE PERCEIVE DISTANCE IS BECAUSE IT TAKES A AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE LIGHT TO BOUNCE OFF AN OBJECT AND REACH OUR EYES

WE NEVER LOOK OUT INTO THE UNIVERSE WE ALWAYS LOOK BACK KENDRICK SMITH EXPLAINS IT MUCH BETTER THAN I

EDIT IF YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF STUFF THE PERIMETER INSTITUTE OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS HAS SOME FANTASTIC PUBLIC LECTURES
INFINITY IS AN INVALUABLE ABSTRACT CONCEPT IN MATHEMATICS PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY NOTHING MORE THE UNIVERSE IS MEASURABLE JUST NOT BY US YET
SPACE LOOKS INFINITE AND ITS LIKELY INTERSPERSED WITH MULTIPLE UNIVERSES SOME GROWING SOME SHRINKING AND SOME JUST EXPERIENCING THEIR MOMENT
THOSE ARE QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED BY SCIENCE NOT PHILOSOPHY
I BELIEVE OUR UNIVERSE IS EXPANDING FROM A BIG BANG THAT WAS CAUSED BY A ULTRA MASSIVE COLLAPSING BLOCKHOLE NEGATIVELY CHARGED ENERGY ONE MUUUCH LARGER THAN OUR UNIVERSE AND OUR UNIVERSE WHICH WAS A HOTSPOT ON THE ACCRETION DISK OF THAT BLOCKHOLE HAD ALL ITS SPIN ANGULAR MOMENTUM ENERGY CONVERT INTO A HUGE EXPLOSION BIG BANG OF NOW POSITIVELY CHARGED ENERGY OUR UNIVERSE EXPANDING IN THE SPACE CLEARED BY THE COLLAPSING BLOCKHOLE THE REST OF THE MATTER SPED OFF FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT DOWN THE BLACK-HOLE DRAIN INTO A BLOCKHOLE SUPER STRING WHICH IS WHY BLACK-HOLE BECOME UNDETECTABLE PAST THE SINGULARITY POINT AND WHY SPACE APPEARS BLACK SPACE IS FILLED WITH JUST SMALLER AND FASTER TRAVELLING PARTICLES ALSO EVERY PARTICLE OF MATTER IN INFINITY HAS INFINITE MASS WITHIN ITSELF IN EVERY DIRECTION AND DIMENSION AND IS A PART OF ANOTHER LARGER PARTICLE OR BODY IT'S THE MASS OF MATTER THAT GIVES WEIGHT TO GRAVITY BECAUSE OF THIS NOT GRAVITY THAT GIVES WEIGHT TO MATTER PERHAPS OUR UNIVERSE IS IN A SEA OF OTHER ULTRA BLACK-HOLE AROUND IT ALL SWIMMING ON OR AROUND AN EVEN BIGGER BLOCKHOLE AND ON THIS GOES FOREVER AND EVER OR WHATEVER THE NEXT BIGGEST MODEL LOOKS LIKE EVEN OUR GALAXY WILL EVENTUALLY BLOCKHOLE THEN OUR UNIVERSE AND SO ON AND THOSE EXPLOSIONS WILL GIVE BIRTH TO A NEW STARS
IS IT TRUE THE UNIVERSE WHERE YOU STARTED FROM IF RELATIVISTIC PRINCIPLES ALLOWED YOU TO REACH TOWARDS
NOT REALLY A PHILOSOPHY QUESTION IS IT FIRST QUESTION IS NO BECAUSE GRAVITY WILL EVENTUALLY OVERCOME DARK ENERGY AND SECOND ANSWER IS NO BECAUSE FIRST ANSWER IS NO AMONG OTHER REASONS
INFINITY IS A COP OUT
INFINITY IS A LIE THE PROOF IS SIMPLE

BORGES THE LIBRARY OF BABEL IS A LIMITED SET WITHIN WHICH EVERYTHING DESCRIBABLE IS DESCRIBED IF INFINITY WERE REAL A SET OF DESCRIPTIONS WHICH DESCRIBES ALL DESCRIBABLE THINGS WOULD BE INFINITE

PEOPLE LIKE TO BRING UP MATHEMATICAL INFINITIES AT THIS POINT BUT IN ORDER FOR A MATHEMATICAL INFINITY TO GENERATE ANY NEWLY DESCRIBABLE REALITY IT MUST HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE GENERATED IN AND CONCEIVED OF BY A MIND IN A DESCRIBABLE REALITY EVENTUALLY THE MIND RUNS OUT OF TIME TO CONCEIVE OF SUCH AN INFINITY AND THE GENERATIVE MECHANISM FAILS DUE TO HEAT DEATH SO THERE ARE NO RELEVANT MATHEMATICAL INFINITIES ONLY CONCEPTUAL INFINITIES THAT ARE DESCRIBABLE

WHERE'S MY NOBEL PRIZE
HEY GUYS THE LAST TIME I POSED ONE OF MY PHILOSOPHICAL CRITIQUES OF EDWARD FESER IT WENT OVER PRETTY WELL SO I THOUGHT YOU'D APPRECIATE ANOTHER EVEN LONGER ONE

THIS IS AN EXTREMELY INVOLVED OVER WORDS CRITIQUE OF THE METAPHYSICS AND ETHICS OF THOMAS AQUINAS AS INTERPRETED THROUGH THE LENS OF SEVERAL OF BOOKS AND ESSAYS I HOPE ANYONE WHO S INTERESTED IN BOTH RELIGION OR METAPHYSICS WHETHER THEY RE CHRISTIAN OR ATHEIST WILL ENJOY THIS PIECE
TAKE TRICHINOSIS

THEOLOGY PROTECTED PEOPLE FROM THIS DISEASE BY A THEOLOGICAL BAN ON THE CONSUMPTION OF PORK HTTPS THEOLOGY IN THIS CASE WAS PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM TRICHINOSIS A MILLENNIUM BEFORE SCIENCE DID

THEOLOGY HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE PRACTICAL WELL-BEING OF PEOPLE

THE MORE ANY THEOLOGY HELPS PEOPLE THE BETTER THAT THEOLOGY IS

THE MORE ANY SCIENTIFIC THEORY HELPS PEOPLE THE BETTER THAT SCIENTIFIC THEORY IS FOR THE PEOPLE

BUT FAITH FOR AQUINAS DOES NOT MEAN AN IRRATIONAL WILL TO BELIEVE SOMETHING FOR WHICH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IT IS RATHER A MATTER OF BELIEVING SOMETHING ON THE BASIS OF DIVINE AUTHORITY
AQUINAS ENSURED THAT YOU AND I WOULD HAVE OUR HUMAN RIGHTS BECAUSE THESE RIGHTS COME FROM GOD

NO ONE MAY TAKE FROM A MAN OR WOMAN WHAT GOD GAVE TO THEM

HERE IS THE OPPOSING VIEW THAT OUR HUMAN RIGHTS DO NOT COME FROM GOD

IF OUR HUMAN RIGHTS ARE GIVEN BY OUR GOVERNMENTS THEN IT MUST ALSO BE TRUE THAT ANY GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE OUR HUMAN RIGHTS AWAY

ARE OUR HUMAN RIGHTS A GIFT FROM GOD AS AQUINAS CLAIMED OR ARE THEY A GIFT FROM GOVERNMENT
THIS IS A COMMON CLICH THAT REALLY HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH SCHOPENHAUER IT'S A LINGUISTIC MISUNDERSTANDING NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE EGOISTIC BECAUSE EGOISM DOESN'T MEAN ACTING ACCORDING TO ONES NATURE IT MEANS ACTING WITH DISREGARD OF OTHERS

WELL NO BECAUSE ON THE OTHER HAND THOSE WHO ARE PSYCHOPATH SPEND LOTS OF TIME ALONE LEAVING SPACE FOR CREATIVITY STUDIES AND KNOWLEDGE THEIR MISSION IS TO CREATE THINGS

THAT'S NOT PSYCHOPATHY IT'S MORE LIKE THE EXACT OPPOSITE PSYCHOPATHY IS CHARACTERIZED BY DESTRUCTIVENESS



YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD STOP WITH THE ABSOLUTES THE VARIED DEFINITIONS ARE COLORED WITH ALL EVERYONE NO ONE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH
SO HOW DID MAN AND WOMAN FIRST REPRODUCE THROUGH THEIR OWN SEXUAL DESIRE ONLY WE MIGHT SAY
THE MOST PSYCHOPATHIC PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO THINK THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

READ THE POST BEFORE YOU REPLY

READ THE POSTED CONTENT UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS GIVEN AND RESPOND TO THESE SUBSTANTIVELY IF YOU HAVE UNRELATED THOUGHTS OR DON'T WISH TO READ THE CONTENT PLEASE POST YOUR OWN THREAD OR SIMPLY REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING COMMENTS WHICH ARE CLEARLY NOT IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE POSTED CONTENT MAY BE REMOVED

THIS SUB IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TANGENTIAL ANECDOTES OR DANK MEMES EXPECT COMMENT THREADS THAT BREAK OUR RULES TO BE REMOVED


TL R ALOT OF POLITICS ISN'T A MATTER OF REALITY VS PERCEPTION ALTHOUGH IT FEELS LIKE THAT WHEN YOU ONLY LISTEN TO NE SIDE OF THE DEBATE 2 YOU'RE THEN GOING TO NEED A GROUP OF PEOPLE DETERMINE WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG WHICH YOU'LL HAVE TO AGREE WITH BEFORE YOU CAN LEGALLY VOTE NO WAY THAT CAN GO WRONG

HOW DO YOU DEFINE WHAT IS KNOWLEDGE
FOR EXAMPLE IS IT FACTUALLY INCORRECT TO SAY I FEEL SAFER WITH LESS MINORITIES AROUND STUPID AND BIGOTED SURE BUT IT COULD CERTAINLY BE TRUE ARGUABLY YOU COULD SAY WELL WHAT IF YOU HAD TO BE EDUCATED ON MIGRATION CRIME RATES ETC BEFORE YOU COULD VOTE BUT THEN THAT POSES ANOTHER PROBLEM ONE WHO DECIDES WHAT'S FACTUAL THERE WE HAVE PLENTY OF STATISTICS THAT DISCUSS AS MUCH BUT IF YOU WHERE REQUIRED TO ACCEPT THAT THEN YOU'RE WALKING A FINE LINE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TRUTH AND AGREEING WITH THE GOVERNMENTS IDEOLOGY WHICH IS A PRETTY DANGEROUS SLOPE OR IF YOU DONT HAVE ONE GROUP DECIDE IT WELL IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY USING SCIENTIFIC STUDIES TO ARGUE THAT THERE WAS NO CLEAR LINK BETWEEN SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER THEN YOU ALREADY KNOW IT WOULDNT REALLY CHANGE ANYTHING OR YANO IF YOU TALK TO ANYONE ABOUT THEIR BELIEFS THEY TYPICALLY HAVE REASONS THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT BASED ON THINGS PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND STUDIES BACKING THEM UP

TWO MOST PEOPLE ON THE DIVIDE AREN'T DEBATING WHAT IS HAPPENING BUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN AND HOW IT WOULD WORK OUT THINGS THAT CAN'T BE FACTUALLY PROVEN PRIOR TO THEM HAPPENING EXAMPLE WE SHOULD EXPAND HEALTHCARE IT'LL HELP PEOPLE IT WOULDN'T COST THAT MUCH VS WE SHOULDN'T EXPAND HEALTHCARE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH WHAT IS ULTIMATELY THEORETICAL PROJECTIONS AT BEST
ABSOLUTELY OBNOXIOUS ARTICLE ARE THE DUMB GOING TO BE EXEMPT FROM PAYING TAXES AS WELL IF NOT DON'T THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE OR DO ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFICIENTLY INTELLIGENT ACCORDING TO SOME METRIC OR OTHER DESERVE A SAY AS TO HOW THEIR TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT AND HOW THEIR COUNTRY IS RUN
I ACCEPT THAT UNINTELLIGENT UNEDUCATED PEOPLE ARE LESS ABLE TO VOTE WISELY BUT I THINK A BETTER SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM IS TO MAKE EDUCATION MORE ACCESSIBLE RATHER THAN RESTRICTING PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO SOMETHING THAT THEY REALLY DO DESERVE
THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT FAR-FETCHED IN FACT EVERY DEMOCRACY THE WORLD OVER PRACTICES IT TO SOME DEGREE
CHILDREN CAN'T VOTE

CHILDREN CAN'T VOTE BECAUSE WE DON'T TRUST THEM TO HAVE ADEQUATELY INFORMED VIEWS NOR DO WE TRUST THEM TO TAKE THE PROCESS SERIOUSLY ARE WE CONCERNED THAT CHILDREN'S NEEDS ARE NOT BEING TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IF SO WOULD THIS PROBLEM BE FIXED IF WE HAD TODDLERS AT THE POLLS
THE PROBLEM IS THAT KNOWLEDGE IS OFTEN FAR GREATER BULLSHIT THAN PLAIN IGNORANCE

THE ECONOMIC EXPERTS CITED IN THE ARTICLE AS AN EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN WRONG OVER AND OVER AGAIN AN EXPERT IN A FIELD LIKE ECONOMICS REQUIRES AN ADHERENCE TO A SPECIFIC IDEOLOGY TO BE PART OF THE EXPERTS IN THE SOVIET UNION AN ECONOMIC EXPERT WOULD HAVE TO BELIEVE IN CENTRAL PLANNING IN THE U S SUCH A POSITION WOULD EXCLUDE ONE FROM BEING AN ECONOMIC EXPERT
THIS IS PART OF LARGER IDEAS CONCERNING VOTING WHICH ARE INTERESTING AND WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT IN HIS ARTICLE POLLUTING THE POLLS PUBLISHED IN HIS IDEAS SHOULD BE AT LEAST DEBATED CONSIDERING THE U SOUTH S CURRENT ELECTION CYCLE CIRCUS ACT ALSO MARCUS ALVAN GIVES SOME WELL THOUGHT REBUTTALS IN HIS ARTICLE PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE A DUTY TO AVOID VOTING BADLY
REMOVED
HE'S WRITING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS IN AMERICAN POLITICS TO AN EXTENT HE JUST WANTS TO TAKE THE IDEA OF THE ELECTORATE ONE STEP FURTHER AND EXPAND IT TO ANYONE WHO CAN PASS SOME SORT OF TESTAMENT

I SUPPOSE THE BIGGEST ISSUE WITH THIS IDEA IS THE SAME ONE WE FACE NOW WITH STANDARDIZED TESTING PEOPLE WHO TEST POORLY OR WHO HAVE LEARNING DISORDERS BUT ARE NOT INHERENTLY UNINTELLIGENT WILL SEE IT AS UNFAIR

I'M NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OPPOSED TO THIS IDEA BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE ON ANYTHING MORE THAN PAPER
THE PREMISE HERE IS THAT INTELLIGENT AND EDUCATED PEOPLE MAKE BETTER DECISIONS

SMART PEOPLE DUMB DECISIONS

WHY DO WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE MAKE DUMB DECISIONS IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES

OK LET'S ACCEPT THIS PREMISE FOR THIS DISCUSSION

DO SMART PEOPLE MAKE BETTER DECISIONS FOR OTHER PEOPLE

DO THEY MAKE DECISIONS THAT WILL GIVE THEM AN ADVANTAGE

WE LET EVERYONE VOTE BECAUSE THEN THE ELECTION REFLECTS BOTH HOW THE ELECTORATE THINKS AND FEELS

DO SMART EDUCATED PEOPLE EVER VOTE THEIR FEELINGS AND IF SO ARE THE FEELINGS OF SMART PEOPLE SMARTER

IF DUMB PEOPLE VOTE BASED UPON THEIR LIMITED THOUGHTS AND THEIR FEELINGS ARE THEY THEN VOTING BADLY

IF SMART PEOPLE VOTE BASED UPON THEIR BETTER THOUGHTS AND THEIR FEELINGS ARE THEY THEN VOTING BETTER

KNOWLEDGE IS TOO GENERALIZED AND YOU NEED TO CONSIDER THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM SYSTEMS SUCH AS PEOPLE LEARNING HOW TO SURVIVE ON THE STREETS ETC
PERSONALLY I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA BUT ONLY IF THE EPISTOCRATIC SYSTEM GIVES AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THESE THINGS A POOR BLACK WOMAN IN THE GHETTOS DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT POLITICAL SCIENCE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT POLITICAL SCIENCE THIS ISN'T TRUE IN EVERY CASE BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY A TRUTH TO IT

I WOULD ALSO IMAGINE THERE BEING LESS OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO SAY IT IS AN UNFAIR SYSTEM IF THIS EPISTOCRACY PUTS FREE COURSES INTO THE BASICS OF POLITICS IN EVERY SCHOOL SYSTEM AND UNIVERSITY AND ALSO LEGALLY GIVING THEM TIME OFF OF WORK OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT SINCE SOME STRUGGLE WITH TIME AS WELL AS MONEY BOTH OF THESE THINGS WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO DO

THIS SYSTEM WOULD ONLY WORK IN MY EYES IF EVERYONE HAD EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO THE INFORMATION THEY WOULD NEED TO PASS A VOTING TESTAMENT WITHOUT THAT IT WOULD BE OVERTHROWN BY THE MASSES CLAIMING THAT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE WELL-BORN OR COME INTO MONEY WILL BE ABLE TO GOVERN THE COUNTRY
BIGGEST CRAP I HAVE LISTENED TO YET
THE UNCARING DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE WILL CONTINUE TO CONFOUND BOTH ELITES AND FORELOCKS ALIKE SUGGESTING SOCIETY MAY BE BETTER SERVED BY THE ILLUSION OF A BASED DEMOCRACY


MIGHT SOUND LIKE NEW AGE MYSTICISM

THOSE DAMN UNWASHED HIPPIES

RATHER THAN THINKING THAT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY OF ALL MATTER I THINK THAT IT IS AN ILLUSION

REMINDS ME OF DANIEL DENNETT IT'S A TRICK LINE OF THINKING WHICH CONFUSES THE FACT THAT WE MISUNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF OUR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE MAKING INCORRECT PREDICTIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS WITH THE BASIC UNDENIABLE FACT THAT WE HAVE A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE
THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTED MANY OF THE HOLES I'VE PONDERED MYSELF REGARDING PANPSYCHISM BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED TOWARDS THE END OF THE ARTICLE WHEN THE AUTHOR EXPRESSED A BELIEF THAT CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE PROBABLY IS AN ILLUSION I'VE HEARD THIS FROM FRIENDS TOO BUT IT JUST MAKES ME WONDER IF THEY'VE REALLY GRASPED THE HARD PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS I REALLY DON'T GET THIS ARGUMENT AT ALL AN ILLUSION STILL PRESUMES SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE IE CONSCIOUSNESS
DELETED
THE ARTICLE MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO DISCUSS OR ARGUE WITH AS THE AUTHOR ARGUES WHAT HE THINKS IS SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS STATE-OF-THE-ART AND NOT WHAT IT REALLY IS FEW EXAMPLES

HE STARTS WITH

IS CONSCIOUSNESS EVERYWHERE

WITHOUT DEFINING WHAT HE MEANS BY CONSCIOUSNESS

THEN THE AUTHOR ASKS

HOW CAN NEURONS FIRING GIVE RISE TO EXPERIENCES OF COLOUR SOUND TASTE PAIN AND SO ON

SOMEHOW IT SEEMS BRAIN PROCESSES ACQUIRE A SUBJECTIVE ASPECT WHICH IS INVISIBLE TO SCIENCE HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY EXPLAIN THIS

WHICH IS INVISIBLE TO SCIENCE BECAUSE MODERN SCIENCE FROWNS UPON SLICING PEOPLE FOR NO GOOD REASON EVEN VERY SIMPLE SIMULATED NEURAL NETWORKS CAN GET THEIR OWN DISTINCT IDEAS OF WHAT IS SOMETHING EAST G TRAIN NEURAL NETWORKS TO FIND DOGS EACH WILL HAVE A BIT DIFFERENT IDEA OF WHAT DOG IS DEPENDING ON TRAINING SET BUT THEY WILL MOSTLY AGREE ON WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T DOG IF PROPERLY TRAINED EVEN SUCH SIMPLE MODEL CAN GIVE US PRETTY GOOD INSIGHT INTO ANSWERING THE QUESTION

BUT THIS IS A DESCRIPTION OF HOW AN ELECTRON IS DISPOSED TO BEHAVE TO HAVE MASS IS TO RESIST ACCELERATION TO HAVE CHARGE IS TO RESPOND IN A CERTAIN WAY TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AND SO ON PHYSICS DOESN T SAY WHAT AN ELECTRON OR ANY OTHER BASIC PARTICLE IS LIKE IN ITSELF INTRINSICALLY

BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PHYSICS IS FINDING MODELS FOR OUR OBSERVATIONS OF THE WORLD THE ANSWER IT TRIES TO PROVIDE IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOT HOW IT WILL HAPPEN


SO I M NOT A PANPSYCHIST I AGREE WITH PANPSYCHIST THAT IT SEEMS AS IF OUR EXPERIENCES HAVE A PRIVATE INTRINSIC NATURE THAT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY SCIENCE

OR MAYBE JUST MAYBE PANPSYCHIST AND THE AUTHOR DON'T KNOW THE SCIENCE


AND SO ON
REMOVED
IT S PLAUSIBLE TO THINK THAT THERE CAN T BE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE WITHOUT A SUBJECT WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE

WHILE IT MAY BE PLAUSIBLE IT IS FAR FROM NECESSARY IT IS IN FACT A BASIC TENET OF BUDDHIST PHENOMENOLOGY THAT THERE IS NO SUBJECT WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE RATHER EXPERIENCE IS FOUND TO BE PRIMARY AND ANY NOTION OF AN EXPERIENCING SUBJECT IS MERELY ONE ELEMENT OF THE BASIC EXPERIENCE THAT IS EXPERIENCE MAY CONTAIN A SENSE OF A SUBJECT BUT THAT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR EXPERIENCE THIS APPROACH MAY ALSO HELP ANSWER THE PRECEDING QUESTION OF AGGREGATION COMBINATION

CONSCIOUSNESS IS INDEED A HARD NUT TO CRACK BUT I THINK WE SHOULD EXHAUST THE OTHER OPTIONS BEFORE WE TAKE A METAPHYSICAL SLEDGEHAMMER TO IT

I FIND THESE KINDS OF GAMBITS TO BETRAY A DISGUSTING AUTHORITARIAN ATTITUDE THE AUTHOR HAS QUITE LEGITIMATELY POSED A NUMBER CHALLENGES TO THE PANPSYCHIST POSITION BUT THEN INSTEAD OF JUST ALLOWING FOR POSSIBLE ANSWERS AND FURTHER CONVERSATION HE SEEKS TO DISLEGITIMATE THE ATTEMPT TO EVEN DEVELOP PANPSYCHIST THEORY AND SEE WHAT IT HAS TO OFFER WHY
I'M NOT FOLLOWING THE HARD PROBLEM WHAT ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS MAKES ITS BEING ROOTED IN A SINGULAR PERSPECTIVE ANY MORE SUBJECTIVE THAN THE REST OF THE WORLD FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS NOTHING KEEPING US FROM TAPPING INTO THE SENSORY RECEPTORS OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND OBSERVING THOSE SENSES AS THE INDIVIDUAL DOES THE INTERPRETATION OF THAT STIMULI WILL BE A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE BUT ONE WHICH COULD BE REENACTED IF ALL THE VARIABLES LEADING UP TO THAT OTHERWISE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE WERE KNOWN RECREATED AND CONTROLLED NOW DO THIS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SENSES AND YOU'VE AT THE VERY LEAST DESIGNED A MOMENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS IDENTICAL TO THE THIS IS ADMITTEDLY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO BUT IF WE ACCEPT THIS AS SUCH THEN WE'RE STILL LEFT WITH THE EXPERIENCE AS BEING SUBJECTIVE RATHER THAN THE PROCESSES WHICH TAKE PLACE ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY DURING A MOMENT OF THOUGHT IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS IN A LARGE WAY DEFINED BY SUBJECTIVITY THEN IT WOULD SEEM CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE EQUATED TO EXPERIENCE

THIS SEEMS MORE IN LINE WITH PANPSYCHISM ANY OBJECT BE IT A QUIRK OR A QUASAR CAN EXPERIENCE SOMETHING A ROCK CAN BE HANDLED A WAVE CAN BE FORMED A SUN CAN DIE THESE EXPERIENCES ARE NO LESS REAL OR VALUABLE THAN THOSE LIVED THROUGH COMPREHENDED AND MEMORIZED BY SOMETHING LIKE THE ANIMAL MIND THE ILLUSION OF WHAT WE THINK OF AS CONSCIOUSNESS THEN BECOMES NOTHING MORE THAN AN IMAGE OF MEANING WE'VE PROJECTED ONTO THE EXPERIENCE THE EXPERIENCE ITSELF IS MEANINGLESS YET WE EQUATE THE PROJECTED MEANING WITH OUR CONCEPTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS

WHAT WE THINK OF AS CONSCIOUSNESS COULD SIMPLE BE A FEEDBACK LOOP OR A REFLECTION MUCH LIKE LOOKING INTO A MIRROR THE REFLECTION IS NOT REAL IF IT IS THE REFLECTED IMAGE WHICH IS BEING CONSIDERED ONLY THE SURFACE AND PHENOMENA LEADING TO THE REFLECTION ARE ACTUALLY REAL HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS THEN BECOMES NOTHING MORE THAN A REFLECTION FROM ONE PARTICULAR ANGLE AMONGST A POTENTIALLY INFINITE QUANTITY OF ANGLES THE REFLECTION OR CONSCIOUSNESS IS NEITHER UNIQUE NOR SUBJECTIVE IT IS SIMPLY A REFLECTION AND SOME THINGS AS WE KNOW ARE REFLECTIVE WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT THE FACT THAT THE HUMAN MIND IS ABLE TO REFLECT ON REFLECTIONS IS WHAT MAKES IT SO AMAZING IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN INFINITELY COMPLEX PRISMATIC ARRAY

EDIT TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT I'M SUGGESTING HERE WATCH THIS

I DON'T THINK IT'S DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH WHAT I'M POSITING BUT IT'S NEVERTHELESS REALLY REALLY INTERESTING
CAN'T ARGUE WITH A

PANPSYCHISM CAN VERY WELL EXIST EXPERIENCE COULD BE A FIELD IN THE PHYSICAL SENSE ONLY BEING EXCITED AT HIGHER ACTIVITY THAT REACHES A CERTAIN COMPLEXITY SUCH AS THE BRAIN

ALL MATTER IS ENERGY BUT WE WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY ARGUE A TABLE TO BE THE SAME AS A CUP IN OUR MACROSCOPIC LEVEL

SO IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS IT COULD MEAN THAT THE IS AN EMERGENT CHARACTERISTIC OF A FINER STRUCTURE
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING RIGHT AT THE START OF THE ARTICLE AND I'M REALLY SORRY BUT THE SCIENCES HAVE NEVER BEEN A STRONG POINT FOR ME SO THIS MIGHT BE REALLY SIMPLE AND I'M JUST OVER THINKING OR SOMETHING DDK WHEN HE'S LIKE HOW DO NEURONS FIRING CONVEY INSERT LIST OF VARIOUS SENSATIONS MY UNDERSTAND WAS THAT THE NERVE END EXPERIENCING THE SENSATION WOULD ONLY FIRE FOR THAT PARTICULAR THING SO FOR EXAMPLE TASTE PLEASE EXCUSE MY SIMPLIFIED AND CHILDISH UNDERSTANDING AND DESCRIPTION YOUR TASTE BUDS WILL ONLY REACT WHEN THEY EXPERIENCE WHATEVER PARTICULAR SENSATION THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SO WHILE THE NEURONS MAY NOT TRANSFER SPECIFIC DATA SAYING THIS TASTE WAS ENCOUNTERED THE BRAIN KNOWING THAT THAT PARTICULAR TASTE BUD EXPERIENCED SOMETHING MEANS IT WAS THAT TASTE EG SOMETHING SOUR
MUST EVERY BRAIN FART BE DIGNIFIED WITH THE TITLE OF PHILOSOPHY

RE PANPSYCHISM WHAT IS THE PROBLEM IT CLAIMS TO SOLVE WHERE IS THE SLIGHTEST EVIDENCE FOR IT WHAT IS ITS PLAUSIBLE MECHANISM

JUST AS SOME PEOPLE WORSHIP THE GOD OF THE GAPS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERY BIT OF IGNORANCE ABOUT THE NATURAL WORLD TO ADVANCE PREPOSTEROUS FANTASIES TO FILL THEM IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS ALSO A PHILOSOPHY OF THE GAPS

YES CONSCIOUSNESS IS VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN BUT SO WAS LIGHTNING CENTURIES AGO YEARS OF SCIENCE HAVE SHOWN US HOW TO APPROACH AND HOPEFULLY SOLVE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS

PANPSYCHISM IS A MORE EXTREME FORM OF ANIMISM DRYADS AND OREADS ANYONE

IS THERE NO PLACE IN PHILOSOPHY FOR THE DETERMINATION OF BULLSHIT
REMOVED
WE ALL LIVE IN REALITY WHICH IS ALWAYS THE SAME YET CONSCIOUSNESS ALTERS IT GREATLY SENSES DICTATE CONSCIOUS A CREATURE WITHOUT EYES OR EARS WOULD HAVE VASTLY DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT WHAT REALITY IS NOT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE IDEA BUT OF THE EVIDENCE GIVEN HUMANS ARE UNIQUE IN THAT WE CAN LOOK DEEPER THAN WHAT WE SENSE WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED AND THEY'RE PERSPECTIVES HAVING THIS ABILITY OPENS THE IDEA TO INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND HOW THEY'RE DEALT WITH THAT'S CALLED CONSCIOUSNESS SO WHEN ASKED WHETHER SOMETHING HAS CONSCIOUS I'D SAY LETS GO ASK
PANPSYCHISM SEEMS UNTOUCHED BY THIS ARTICLE NOT AT ALL A NEW AGE MYSTICISM
FAILS TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF CONSCIOUSNESS SO WE ARE BLAMING A SPECIFIC IDEA FOR NOT FIXING A SUPER OBSCURE IDEA WHAT IS THIS ONE MYSTERY THAT MUST BE SOLVED THERE IS NOT JUST ONE MYSTERY ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS BUT A MULTITUDE OF SUBJECTIVE QUESTIONS ATTACHED TO IT EVERYONE PERCEIVES IT DIFFERENTLY IN VARYING DEGREES I WOULD NEVER ASSUME ANY IDEA THEOLOGY OR PATHOLOGY COULD DEFINE IT SO WELL IT SOLVES EVERY MYSTERY WITHIN IT LOL
THE AUTHOR WRITES IF BILLIONS OF HUMANS ORGANISED THEMSELVES TO FORM A GIANT BRAIN EACH PERSON SIMULATING A SINGLE NEURON AND SENDING SIGNALS TO THE OTHERS USING MOBILE PHONES IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THEIR CONSCIOUSNESSES WOULD MERGE TO FORM A SINGLE GIANT CONSCIOUSNESS

ISN'T THERE POTENTIAL EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THIS MAY BE THE CASE WE COULD IN PRINCIPLE MEASURE THIS GIANT COLLECTIVE AND ASK IT HOW IT FEELS ETC ETC
WHAT IF WE WORKED TOP TO BOTTOM WE KNOW WHAT CONSCIOUSNESS ISN'T RIGHT IT MANIFESTS ITS SELF IN OUR BRAINS A BULLET CAN KILL IT OFF IN A FRACTION OF A SECOND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT PERHAPS WE JUST GOT LUCKY AND OUR BRAINS REALLY WOULD START SELF AWARENESS AND OUR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE AND INTERACT GAVE EARLY HUMANS PROTO CONSCIOUSNESS THEN THAT EVOLVED THOSE WHO CAN SHARE THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS MORE AND USE IT WISELY WOULD THUS BE PASSED IN MORE

I THINK CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE SUM OF ALL BRAIN ACTIVITY SUPPORTED BY THE REST OF THE BODY INDIVIDUAL BRAIN CELLS AREN'T CONSCIOUSNESS BUT WHEN THEY FIRE I'M CERTAIN WAYS AND IN CERTAIN PATTERS THE BRAIN UTILIZES THE ORGANS TO ACHIEVE SELF AWARENESS

BAD THEORY DDK WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I'M ONLY IN HIGHSCHOOL BUT IT'S A IDEA I GUESS
WHAT IF GOD IS THE COLLECTION OF THE CLOUDS OF ALL SUBATOMIC PARTICLES
SIMPLE GEOMETRY
I HAVE A PHILOSOPHY TRUST THE MYSTERY THAT MOUILL NEVER SOLVE EVERYTHING
WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING REALLY NEW AGE NOT REALLY NEW AGE
WHO EVER SAID IT WOULD SOLVE ANYTHING THAT'S LIKE SAYING RECONSTRUCTIONISM FAILS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WITH EPISTEMOLOGY THERE ARE SEVERAL TYPES OF PANPSYCHISM BUT NONE OF THEM ARE SOLUTIONS TO ANYTHING THEY ARE A SET OF THEORIES POINTING TO THE POSSIBILITIES WHY NATURALIST PHYSICALIST MATERIALISM AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY MIGHT BE FLAWED IN ITS ASSUMPTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

LITERALLY OF THE COMPLAINTS POSTED ON R PHILOSOPHY AGAINST PANPSYCHISM ARE BASED IN SOME MISINTERPRETATION OR ANOTHER
I'LL SUMMARIZE HIS 2 OBJECTIONS AND GIVE MY REBUTTAL

HOW COULD THE SMALLER CONSCIOUSNESSES OF ATOMS ETC COMBINE INTO LARGER ONES
2 HOW CAN SMALLER CONSCIOUS OBJECTS ATOMS ETC BE CONSCIOUS WITHOUT A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE

IN THE LATEST AND BEST WRITINGS ON PANPSYCHISM CONSCIOUSNESS IS DESCRIBED AS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY THIS MEANS THAT THE MACRO EFFECTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE MICRO STRUCTURE WHICH CREATES THOSE EFFECTS SO CONSCIOUSNESS ONLY ARISES THROUGH A SUFFICIENTLY LARGE ENOUGH NUMBER OF CONNECTED INFORMATION PROCESSING CELLS BITS ETC CONSCIOUSNESS IS PRESENT IN LOWER LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION ONLY AS A LATENT PROPERTY WHICH CAN ONLY EMERGE GIVEN THE PROPER STRUCTURE

SO IT IS A MISUNDERSTANDING TO SAY THAT THERE ARE SEPARATE CONSCIOUSNESS AT THE LOW LEVEL AND THAT THESE SOMEHOW COMBINE THE SMALLER OBJECTS BEINGS ETC MIGHT BE CONSCIOUS IN THAT THEY POSSESS THE LATENT PROPERTIES NECESSARY FOR CONSCIOUSNESS BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE LIKE OUR OWN IT COULD BE THAT THEY HAVE A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE VERY DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL IT COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TO BE THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE A MUCH MORE COMPLEX ORGANISM COULD BE SO ADVANCED WE MIGHT NOT SEEM CONSCIOUS IN COMPARISON TO IT

THE MOST LIKELY IS THAT THERE IS A PROGRESSION OF QUALITY IN CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE FROM THE MOST COMPLEX DOWN TO THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD FOR IT TO EMERGE IF THERE IS SUCH THE MORE COMPLEX THE ORGANISM THE MORE DEVELOPED THE CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE DEEPER THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE SIMPLE MATTER IS DRASTICALLY LESS COMPLEX THAN A LIVING CELL AND IF IT DOES HAVE A CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE IT IS PROPORTIONALLY AS SIMPLE IN ITS SUBJECTIVITY PERHAPS NOT POSSESSING IT AT ALL ONLY POSSESSING A LATENT PROPERTY THAT CAN BE EXPRESSED THROUGH COMBINATION
I LIKE THE OBJECTIONS RAISED BUT I WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO A PARTICULAR PASSAGE WHICH IS MADE FROM A POSITION OF IGNORANCE

FOR SO FAR AS OUR EVIDENCE GOES IT IS A HIGHLY LOCALISED PHENOMENON THAT IS SPECIFIC NOT ONLY TO BRAINS BUT TO PARTICULAR STATES OF BRAINS

THIS LEAVES OUT A LOT OF EVIDENCE OF THE CONTRARY I UNDERSTAND THAT AWARENESS OF THESE STUDIES IS LOW BUT THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT BRAIN STATES ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS IN THE NDE RESEARCH I FIND THAT EVERY PHILOSOPHER NEEDS TO LOOK AT THIS AND LISTEN TO THE RESEARCHERS WHO PERFORMED RESEARCH IN THIS DIRECTION IN THE PAST YEARS WE LEARNED A LOT DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GO TO THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR NEAR DEATH STUDIES AND READ UP ON THE RESEARCH

THERE IS A LOT OF SECONDARY EVIDENCE THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT DIRECTLY LINKED TO BRAIN ACTIVITY ALSO STILL IN NEED OF A SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION FOR EXAMPLE PSYCHOBILIN RESEARCH IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING IN THAT IT SHOWS DIMINISHING ACTIVITY CORRESPONDING TO HIGHER AWARENESS THERE ARE THE GANZFELD EXPERIMENTS THAT PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT CONSCIOUS INFLUENCE REACHES BEYOND THE BRAIN INTO THE PHYSICAL WORLD PRETENDING THAT THESE THINGS DON'T EXIST OR ARE SUFFICIENTLY DEBUNKED IS SIMPLY BEING INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST

I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO CONTINUE IN THE VEIN OF THINKING THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN IS THE ONLY PLACE WE ARE INTELLECTUALLY AND SCHOLARLY ALLOWED TO LOOK FOR CONSCIOUSNESS PASS THAT STAGE AND FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH RESEARCHERS WHO ACTIVELY TRY TO STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF MIND OUTSIDE OF THE BRAIN IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND THEN COME UP WITH AN IDEA AS TO HOW THIS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK PICK UP CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE BY DEAN RADIN FOR EXAMPLE AT LEAST TRY TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DISMISSING
WITH RESPECT P C A LOT OF THESE FOLKS ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT DEAN STUFF AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE IT AND BELIEVE IT IS RELEVANT A LOT OF THESE READERS WILL AUTOMATICALLY DISMISS IT AS WOO STUFF WHATEVER THAT REALLY MEANS IF SOMEONE HAD TRIED TO EXPLAIN SUPERPOSITION OR THE EXPERIMENT TO ONE OF THE CENTURY'S MOST EMINENT SCIENTISTS THEY HOWLED NOT TO TODAY THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT IT'S NOT WOO WORK WILL ULTIMATELY BE RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT IT IS THE TRUTH LET THEM HOWL THEY'RE WRONG AGAIN IN THE END IT WON'T MATTER

PHYSICS DOESN T SAY WHAT AN ELECTRON OR ANY OTHER BASIC PARTICLE IS LIKE IN ITSELF INTRINSICALLY AND ARGUABLY IT NEVER COULD SINCE ITS CONCEPTUAL RESOURCES MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS TOGETHER WITH THE CONCEPTS OF CAUSATION AND SPATIOTEMPORAL POSITION ARE SUITABLE ONLY FOR DESCRIBING STRUCTURES AND PROCESSES NOT INTRINSIC QUALITIES

THIS TYPE OF POSITION HAS A NAME IN PHILOSOPHY ALREADY IT IS CALLED INSTRUMENTALISM
DENNETT CLAIMS THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN ILLUSION THAT IT IS SOME SORT OF BYPRODUCT OF ELECTROCHEMICAL PROCESSES IN THE BRAIN IT IS SOMEHOW ANCILLARY TO THE FUNCTIONING ANIMAL BRAIN THAT EVOLVED OVER TIME TO SURVIVE AND PROCREATE ONLY

THE PROBLEM IS THAT AN ILLUSION REQUIRES AN OBSERVER WHO OR WHAT IS THIS OBSERVER DANIEL DENNETT MEAT PUPPET THAT SURVIVES IN ORDER TO PROCREATE THAT BY DEFINITION HAS NO REAL FREE WILL NO THIS OBSERVER IS AWARENESS I'D ITALICIZE THE WORD IF I COULD BY HIS DEFINITION OUR ANIMAL BRAIN ONLY REACTS ITALICIZED IN ORDER TO SURVIVE NO FREE WILLIAM YET MY EXPERIENCE TELLS ME EVERY DAY THAT I HAVE FREE WILL AND THAT I MAKE MISTAKES BECAUSE OF IT BY HIS DEFINITION THE ANIMAL BRAIN WOULD NOT MAKE MISTAKES IT MIGHT NOT SURVIVE BECAUSE OF LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT WOULD NOT BE A MISTAKE BECAUSE THERE IS NO FREE WILL INVOLVED I GUESS IT WOULD JUST BE LUCK KISMET

I REJECT DENNETT POSITION UTTERLY BECAUSE OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE THERE IS AN OBSERVER AN AWARENESS IN ALL OF US SOMETHING THAT HAS YET TO BE EXPLAINED MAY NEVER BE EXPLAINED BUT IS THERE IT OBSERVES US OBSERVING OURSELVES AND IT IS INTERNAL IN ALL OF US IT TELLS US WHEN WE ARE DOING RIGHT OR WRONG AND IT GIVES US OUR FREE WILLIAM I'M NOT CALLING IT GOD OR THE SOUL OR WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT IT'S THERE CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT AN ILLUSION JUST ASK YOURSELF AM I REALLY AWARE YOU ARE SUCK ON A LEMON DANIEL YOU'RE WRONG AND DEEP DOWN YOU KNOW IT OR MORE LIKELY YOU HOPE YOU'RE WRONG DON'T WORRY YOU ARE
XO BROTHERS AND SISTERS
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS THERE IS EFFECTIVELY NO UNIVERSE WHILE WE CAN IMAGINE A UNIVERSE THAT PERSISTS WITHOUT THE KNOWING OF IT NO ONE HAS EVER OR COULD EVER BE THERE TO KNOW IT THUS ALL THAT IS IS WITHIN CONSCIOUSNESS MORE APPARENTLY SO WHEN WE DO NOT REFERENCE BACK TO THOUGHTS THAT SUGGEST OTHERWISE IF WE ARE GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS AND ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH OF IT THEN WE MUST GET TO KNOW OURSELVES AS CONSCIOUSNESS AND NOT AS THE PERSON THAT APPEARS IN FRONT OF IT YOU INDEED WHEN OUR CONSCIOUS ATTENTION RESTS BACK UPON THE FORMLESS SOURCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF ATTENTION NO LONGER CATERS TO MIND AND THERE IS SILENCE THIS IS HOW WE CAN BETTER KNOW CONSCIOUSNESS AS CONSCIOUSNESS CHECK IT OUT NOW FOR A FEW SECONDS DO NOT BE FOOLED IN THINKING THAT KNOWLEDGE WORTH KNOWING EXISTS ONLY IN WORDS
ME AT THE ENTIRETY OF ALL THINGS CAN BE SYNONYMOUS WITH CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE INDEPENDENT DISCOVERY OF MONISM

ME AT CONSCIOUSNESS AS A DESCRIPTION IS REDUNDANT AND FANCIFUL

ME TODAY WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS
REMOVED
REMOVED
THE FIRST IS THE FAMOUS HARD PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS HOW DOES THE BRAIN PRODUCE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE
I THINK THE BRAIN EXPRESSES CONSCIOUSNESS AND DOES NOT ITSELF PRODUCE IT THE EGO PORTION OF EXPRESSED CONSCIOUSNESS IS A BY PRODUCT OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUT IS IT REAL OR THE PROMULGATION OF MISUNDERSTANDING
CASTING CONSCIOUSNESS AS ILLUSION THREATENS THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PHYSICAL MODELS OF THE UNIVERSE THE AUTHOR DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN REPRESENTATIONAL SENSES AND INNER SENSES AS A WAY TO MAINTAIN A SORT OF DUALISM

AS WELL AS SENSES FOR REPRESENTING THE EXTERNAL WORLD WE HAVE A SORT OF INNER SENSE WHICH REPRESENTS ASPECTS OF OUR OWN BRAIN ACTIVITY AND THIS INNER SENSE GIVES US A VERY SPECIAL PERSPECTIVE ON OUR BRAIN STATES CREATING THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAVE INTRINSIC PHENOMENAL QUALITIES THAT ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ALL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SENSES FOR REPRESENTING THE EXTERNAL WORLD AND INNER SENSES FROM AN IDEALIST SUBJECTIVIST STANDPOINT ANY SENSE WE HAVE OR UNDERGO IS QUALIA TOTALLY EXPERIENTIAL AND UNAVAILABLE TO OUR SUBJECTIVE MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE IF IT WERE OTHERWISE

AS FAR AS I CAN SEE ALL SENSES WHETHER REPRESENTATIONAL IN THE STRICT SENSE OR NOT VISION AS REPRESENTING SOMETHING THAT IS VS VISION AS AN EXPERIENCE THAT IS MINE ARE STILL INTERNAL SUBJECTIVE PHENOMENA CASTING CONSCIOUSNESS SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OR QUALIA AS AN ILLUSION THROWS THE WHOLE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE AS WE KNOW IT INTO DOUBT NOT JUST OUR CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT BECAUSE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AS WE KNOW IT EXISTS INSIDE AND FOR PERSONAL CONSCIOUSNESS

IF BEING CONSCIOUS OF OUR WORLD IS AN ILLUSION WHY IS THE WORLD ITSELF NOT AN ILLUSION
COULDN'T BOTH OF THE PROBLEMS WITH PANPSYCHISM PRESENTED BY THE AUTHOR BE ADDRESSED BY HOW ENTANGLEMENT APPEARS TO BE WORKING UNDER THE BANNER OF ER APR IF THE SYSTEMS ARE ENTANGLED YOU HAVE A SUBJECTIVE SYSTEM A SMALL ENTANGLED GROUP OF COMPLEXITY AND AN OBJECTIVE SYSTEM EVERYTHING ELSE

THIS IS WHAT ARISTOTLE DESCRIBES AS AN ENTHYMEME RIGHT


THIS REMINDS ME OF DAVID LEWIS WORK ON CONVENTION AND ROBERT WORK ON PRESUPPOSITIONS


SUPPOSE THERE'S A CROWD OF PEOPLE AT A TOWN HALL MEETING THERE ARE THINGS THAT THEY ALL AGREE ABOUT AND ON OTHER THINGS THEY DISAGREE THE AGREEMENTS ARE WHERE THEY SHARE CONVENTIONAL COORDINATION THE DISAGREEMENTS ARE COMPETING CONVENTIONS OR CONTROVERSIES A SINGLE DISSENTER MIGHT BE SEEN AS A BUT THAT SEMANTICS MIGHT NOT SAY MUCH IN LEWISIAN TERMS IT'S SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT IF ONE PERSON TRUTHFULLY DISSENTS THEN THAT QUALIFIES AS ESTABLISHING A CONTROVERSY A CONTROVERSIAL IMPLICIT PREMISE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE EXPLICIT PREMISES

THE PROBLEM IS IN PRACTICE SOMETIMES MINORITY DISSENT GETS DISMISSED NO ONE LISTENS TO THEM THEY'LL SAY BUT IT IS THOSE WHO DISCREDIT TRUTHFUL ACCOUNTS THAT SHOULD NOT BE LISTENED TO

EDIT
REGARDING OBVIOUSNESS IT'S A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT FOR BOTH THE CRITERIA OF IMPLICIT PREMISE VALIDITY AND OBVIOUSNESS THE THRESHOLD OF TRUTH SEEMS TO BE ASSESSING SOMETHING LIKE ACCEPTANCE AT MULTIPLE LEVELS WE COULD ARGUE THAT IF INDIVIDUALLY OUT OF PEOPLE SEE SOMETHING BUT PERSON DOES NOT IT SHOULD STILL BE CONSIDERED OBVIOUS AT LARGE UNFORTUNATELY FOR THAT ONE PERSON WHO DIDN'T SEE IT THE IMPLICIT PREMISE WAS NOT OBVIOUS ENOUGH I GUESS THERE COULD BE DEGREES OF OBVIOUSNESS IF NOT THEN WHAT'S THE THRESHOLD OF OBVIOUS BY CONVENTION EVEN THE ANSWER SUFFERS FROM CONTROVERSY DUE TO A VARIETY OF APPROACHES IS THE ANSWER BIVALENT OR PARACONSISTENT IN TRUTH WHAT KIND OF PRAGMATIC ACCOUNT IS AT WORK
WOULD YOU CONSIDER THE ROBOTIC REPLICA WHICH MATCHES THE ACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS OF YOUR SPOUSE AS EQUIVALENT TO YOUR SPOUSE

IS IT POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY PREDICT WHAT A CONSCIOUS MIND WILL DO WITHOUT USING CONSCIOUS MINDS OBVIOUSLY TO SOME EXTENT IT DOESN'T TAKE CONSCIOUSNESS TO PREDICT THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN UNABLE TO EAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS WILL ATTEMPT TO EAT WE CAN PREDICT GREATER CRIME RATES FOR POPULATIONS WITH GREATER POVERTY AND WORSE EDUCATION I MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUILD A ROBOT THAT'S A CONVINCING REPLICA OF A PERSON SO LONG AS YOU DON'T INTERACT WITH IT FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE BUT WHEN YOU ASK FOR MORE PREDICTIONS AND MORE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS IT'S FAR FROM CLEAR THAT YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT A CONSCIOUSNESS INVOLVED

AS FOR EQUIVALENCE NO BUT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE IMPRECISE IF A POWERFUL VAMPIRE READ YOUR SPOUSE'S MIND AND GLAMOURED THEMSELVES AND THEN WITH THEIR ACTING ABILITIES TRIED TO STEP IN AS YOUR SPOUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE EQUIVALENT TO YOUR SPOUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS THE VAMPIRE MIGHT BE DRIVEN TO SEEK BLOOD AT NIGHT FOR INSTANCE EVEN IF THEY SUPPRESS THE URGE THEY MIGHT PRETEND TO BE LESS CAPABLE OF CERTAIN TASKS OR HAVE TO WORK ESPECIALLY HARD TO MIMIC SKILLS THAT YOUR SPOUSE FINDS TRIVIAL THEY WILL HAVE TO LIE SOMETIMES WHEN YOUR SPOUSE COULD MAKE THE SAME REPORT HONESTLY AND I AT LEAST VALUE HONESTY IN THOSE CLOSE TO ME IT'S LIKE STYLING TOFU TO LOOK LIKE A CHEESEBURGER AND CLAIMING THAT THEY'RE THE SAME THING

SO AT LEAST SOME POSSIBLE WAYS TO REPLACE A PERSON WITH AN APPARENT REPLICA OF THAT PERSON ARE DECIDEDLY NOT EQUIVALENT

THE OTHER PART OF IT IS CONSENT REPLACING A PERSON WITH A REPLICA AGAINST THEIR WILL AND WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS AT BEST EQUIVALENT TO MURDERING A PERSON REVIVING THEM AND ERASING THEIR MEMORY OF THE EXPERIENCE AND ERASING MEMORIES IS A LITTLE LIKE MURDER

BUT IF IT WERE A REPLICA THAT WERE DESIGNED TO BE AS CLOSE TO IDENTICAL TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE AND TECHNOLOGY ALLOWED IT TO BE MORE PRECISE THAN ANYONE COULD DISTINGUISH THEN I'D TRIP OVER MYSELF TO HAVE THAT DONE TO ME I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SIGN FAST ENOUGH
AS FAR AS THE ROBOT WIFE THING GOES PERHAPS WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT A DIFFERENT WAY

IF YOUR WIFE WAS KIDNAPPED AND REPLACED BY THE ROBOTIC REPLICA AND YOU COULDN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE THEN WOULDN'T THAT IMPLY THAT THE ROBOT HAS ALL THE RELEVANT CAUSAL PROPERTIES TO BE CONSIDERED A PERSON THE FACT THAT IN AT LEAST SOME SENSE IT IS NOT THE SAME PERSON DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT ISN'T A PERSON AT ALL

IF THE ABOVE SCENARIO HAPPENED AND YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT IT YOU WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLY VERY UPSET THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES THIS DOESN'T IMPLY THAT THEY CAN'T BOTH HAVE MINDS

POINT IS THAT ANYTHING THAT HAS THE CAUSAL POWERS OF A CONSCIOUS MIND IS A CONSCIOUS MIND NOT ANYTHING THAT HAS THE CAUSAL POWERS OF A PARTICULAR CONSCIOUS MIND IS THAT PARTICULAR CONSCIOUS MIND SO YOU CAN AT LEAST IN THEORY HAVE DUPLICATE MINDS THAT ARE IDENTICAL IN FORM BUT DIFFER IN HISTORY OR OTHER DETAILS RELEVANT TO PERSONAL IDENTITY BUT WHICH DON'T MAKE IT NOT A MIND
THIS IS A PRETTY HILARIOUS COMMENT GIVEN THAT MY SO AND I HAVE THIS DISCUSSION EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS HE HAS MS DEGREES IN AI AND I HAVE MY SHARE OF COMP SCI DEGREES AND WE WOULD LIKE TO BOTH BECOME IMMORTAL IN DEEP MIND SUPER COMPUTER I HAVE WATCHED AND READ SEVERAL REFUTATIONS OF ARGUMENTS MANY HAVE BEEN POSTED IN THIS SUB AND HIS CONCLUSION PERSISTENT REFUTATION OF SYSTEMS ARGUMENT ETC SEEM TO COME DOWN TO HE DOES NOT BELIEVE AI CAN REPRODUCE CONSCIOUSNESS NOR CAN WE DEFINE IT ONLY COMPUTER SCIENCE WILL EVENTUALLY PROVE WHO WILL BE RIGHT RAY KURZWEIL THE GUY BEHIND GOOGLE AI AT THE MOMENT REALLY IS TRYING TO RECREATE ALL BRAIN FUNCTIONS THROUGH AI MODELS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THIS IS BEING DONE VIA LAYERS OF MODELING LEVELS OF MACHINE LEARNING REPLICATION OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH AND NOT FORMAL PROGRAMS OR ROUTINES OR OTHER FORMS OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS OFTEN REFERENCED HERE IF YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THIS AI APPROACH PERHAPS YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN RAY EXPLANATION OF IT YOU CAN DECIDE IF YOU THINK AI CAN MODEL REPRODUCE CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE FUTURE WOULD THIS VIRTUAL CONSCIOUSNESS BE THE SAME AS CURRENT BIOLOGICAL HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TEST IT IF SOMEONE GAVE ME A REPLICANT OF MY SO ALSO SEE THE MOVIE BLADERUNNER
NOW LET S ASSUME YOU HAVE BEEN IN A HAPPY MARRIAGE FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE MANY SHARED EXPERIENCES WITH YOUR SPOUSE WE TAKE YOUR SPOUSE AND MAP THEIR BRAIN AND BODY AND BUILD A ROBOT CYBORG REPLICA THAT IS ABLE TO MATCH THE CONTROL POWERS OF THEIR BRAIN AND PHYSICALLY ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM YOUR SPOUSE THE ROBOT EVEN WOULD HAVE THE MEMORIES OF YOUR SPOUSE IN ITS MEMORY THIS REPLICA IS SO EFFECTIVE AT PRODUCING THE RESPONSES AND REACTIONS OF YOUR SPOUSE THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN YOUR SPOUSE AND THE ROBOT EVEN THOUGH THEIR EXTERNAL OUTPUTS ARE THE SAME WOULD YOU CONSIDER THE ROBOTIC REPLICA WHICH MATCHES THE ACTIONS AND BEHAVIORS OF YOUR SPOUSE AS EQUIVALENT TO YOUR SPOUSE WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOUR SPOUSE AND THE ROBOT AS INTERCHANGEABLE IF NOT THEN THERE MUST BE SOMETHING BESIDES CONTROL POWERS OF THE BRAIN THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE IDENTITY AND CATEGORIZATION OF MINDS

LET'S SAY THAT I HAVE A FAVORITE KNIFE WHICH I HAVE USED FOR YEARS AND HAS GREAT SENTIMENTAL VALUE TO ME IF I WAS HANDED AN EXACT COPY OF THAT KNIFE IT WOULDN'T HOLD THE SAME VALUE TO ME

PREDATION IS IMPORTANT TO THE BIODIVERSITY OF EVERY SPECIES UNLESS WE FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER EVERY ASPECT OF THE ANIMALS COMPLETELY AGAINST THEIR WILL MIND YOU A ECOSYSTEM WOULD BE UNTENABLE THIS IS TAKING THE IDEA OF ENDING SUFFERING TO AN ABSURD DEGREE

IF CONSCIOUSNESS CREATES REALITY WHAT CREATES CONSCIOUSNESS IT SEEMS YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH THE IDEA OF FIRST CAUSE AND MANAGE TO SOLVE IT BY CLAIMING FIRST CAUSE IS ELSEWHERE BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY SHIFTING THE REFERENCE FRAME AND DECLARING SUCCESS
GREAT POST AND WELL EXPLAINED I'M NO EXPERT BUT I'LL TRY AND ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN A THOUGHT OUT MANNER

IF WE ASSUME THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS A NATURAL PHENOMENA OF MATTER THEN YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT IN TERMS OF COMPLEX PATTERNS IF OUR BRAINS ARE MADE OF VERY COMPLEX PATTERNS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY OF PERCEPTION THEN WHEN YOU DIE THOSE PATTERNS STOP FUNCTIONING AND CHANGE SHAPE THEREFORE LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS CONSCIOUSNESS AND PERCEPTION IS IN THE PRESENT FOR EVERY MOMENT IN TIME YOU HAVE PERCEPTION BUT THAT PERCEPTION STOPS WHEN YOU DIE YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT SOME UNEARTHLY ENTITY THAT FLOATS AROUND WAITING TO JUMP INTO A NEW MIND OR BODY IT IS SIMPLY A CONSEQUENCE OR RESULT OF MATTER

2 SO YOU WOULD ASSUME THAT IF ALL THE MATTER IN YOUR BRAIN WAS COPIED AND MADE PERFECTLY IN ANOTHER THAT YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS WOULD TRANSFER ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE SAME BEHAVIORS AND MAYBE EVEN MEMORIES AS BEFORE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT A SINGLE ENTITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS JUMPED FROM YOU OLD BODY TO YOUR NEW ONE
JUST LIKE RIGHT NOW YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS NOW IS NOT THE EXACT SAME IS AN INSTANCE AGO YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS JUST A RESULT OF PERCEPTION SO IT CHANGES IN EVERY MOMENT

I AGREE THAT CONSCIOUSNESS MUST CREATE REALITY HOWEVER THE EXTANT OF THIS COULD BE VERY LARGE IF WE REPLACE CONSCIOUSNESS WITH PERCEPTION THEN WE CAN MAKE A STATEMENT THAT FOR THERE TO BE EXISTENCE THERE MUST BE MATTER ENERGY OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES AND THERE MUST ALSO BE SOMETHING TO PERCEIVE OR EXPERIENCE THAT MATTER ENERGY ETC THIS HOWEVER DOESN'T MEAN THAT WHEN THE TREE FALLS IN THE FOREST AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO HEAR IT IT DOESN'T MAKE A SOUND YOU AND I ARE LIVING PROOF THAT HUMANS HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF PERCEPTION BUT YOU WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THAT A DOG DOES ASWELL AS SO DOES A FISH AND EVEN AN ANT TO SOME DEGREE NOW IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONLY LIFE ITSELF HAS THE ABILITY OF PERCEPTION BUT MAYBE SIMPLE MATTER DOES TOO THIS COULD MEAN THAT A SINGLE ATOMS HAS THE PROPERTY OF PERCEPTION IT JUST ISN'T NEAR AS COMPLEX OR IMPACTFUL AS THAT OF AN ANTIQUITIES
BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT CONSCIOUSNESS AND PERCEPTION AS A BASIC LAW OF THE UNIVERSE EVEN ON THE ATOMIC LEVEL RATHER THAN BEING A SMALL COINCIDENCE THAT THE UNIVERSE CREATED
EVEN THOUGH ARGUMENT IS NEITHER NEW NOR COMPLEX IT IS NEVERTHELESS PROFOUND THERE IS IN FACT A WHOLE BOOK OF THE BIBLE THAT IS ENTIRELY FOCUSED ON A GOOD MAN SUFFERING FOR NO REASON SO NO ONE SHOULD PRETEND THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT TAKEN ON BY THOUGHT

SINGER TAKES ONE POINT THE FACT THAT THERE IS IN THE WORLD SUFFERING THAT DOES NOT ORIGINATE FROM THE ACTIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT AS SUCH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY THE USE OF FREE WILL AND AFFIRMS THAT IF THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS AN OMNIPOTENT AND BENEVOLENT GOD HE WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED THE WORLD IN SUCH A WAY

MY BEST ANSWER IS AS FOLLOWS WHAT SINGER DOES NOT DO AND WHERE HE FAILS IS THAT HE DOES NOT IMAGINE HIS WORLD WITHOUT SUFFERING BECAUSE IT IS TO HIM OBVIOUS THAT A WORLD WITHOUT SUFFERING IS SUPERIOR TO A WORLD WITH SUFFERING MY CONTENTION WHICH IS CONTENTION IS THAT WORLD WITH SUFFERING IS SUPERIOR TO A WORLD WITHOUT SUFFERING BECAUSE IT PROVIDES US WITH OCCASIONS TO DO GOOD THE RABBI IN MY HOMETOWN USED TO SAY THERE ARE BAGGERS SO THAT WE GIVE THEM CHARITY WHICH IS JUST AS SAYING THERE IS SUFFERING SO THAT WE MAY ALLEVIATE IT THE PERFECT WORLD OF PETER SINGER HAS FREE WILL BUT NO WAY TO EXERCISE IT IN A MEANINGFUL FASHION AND AS SUCH IS A WORSE WORLD AMONG POSSIBLE WORLDS THAN THIS ONE
THIS IS ALSO A CHAPTER IN HIS NEW BOOK
I FIND THESE ARGUMENTS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT SEEMS THERE ARE SO MANY COUNTER ARGUMENTS SO I SHOULD MENTION THAT I DON'T TAKE THE FOLLOWING AS PROOF OF GOD OR ANYTHING BUT A DISPROOF OF THE DISPROOF IF THAT MAKES SENSE

SO WHAT IF WE CAN ONLY CONCEIVE OF THE GOOD IF THE BAD ALSO EXISTS MAYBE GOD THOUGHT THAT GOOD WAS OOOO GOOD THAT HE INVENTED EVIL TOO I MEAN WE'RE CONJECTURING ON THE MOTIVATIONS OF A BEING THAT SUPPOSEDLY CREATED EVERYTHING SO WHO KNOWS A RELATED BUT NOT EXACTLY THE SAME ARGUMENT IS WHAT IF HE DOESN'T THINK EVIL IS BAD BUT MERELY A TEST OF CHARACTER WE MIGHT THINK THAT SUCKS BUT WHO ARE WE TO QUESTION OR MAYBE HE INVENTED FREE WILL BECAUSE FREE WILL IS A HIGHER GOOD THAN ALL EVIL THAT COMES FROM IT THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF CONSCIOUSNESS IF WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF EVIL IS IT EVIL

AND ALL THAT'S JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD MY RELIGIOUS VIEWS PROBABLY INCLUDE A CHRISTIAN SUPREME FORCE OR WHAT HAVE YOU BUT EVEN THAT ASIDE THIS IS KIND OF CRAP LOGIC
REASONING REMINDS ONE OF A MINIMALLY PROGRAMMED ROBOT
NOTHING NEW OR INTERESTING HERE
IF LEIBNIZ IS CORRECT AND WE ARE INDEED LIVING IN THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS THAT GOD COULD CREATE THEN THIS MUST BE HEAVEN
WHY IS SUFFERING CONSIDERED EVIL BAD WHY IS GOOD NO SUFFERING BETTER

REHASHED ARGUMENT MAKES THIS ASSUMPTION IS IT NOT POSSIBLE NEITHER ARE GOOD NOR EVIL WHAT DOES THE ATOM CARE IF IT IS IN A SYSTEM UNDER DURESS
I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE COULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT EVIL IN OUR UNIVERSE WE NEED IT IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE INFINITE LOVE OF OUR INFINITE CREATOR

BUT I'M ALSO OF THE OPINION THAT THE GOD IN LE HOLY BIBLE IS A FICTIONAL CHARACTER
THE EXAMPLE OF SUFFERING OR EVIL IS NOT DISPROOF OF BENEVOLENCE BUT RATHER DOUBT OF OMNIPOTENCE

VINCENT BUGLIOSI PUT THE SAME ARGUMENT AS GOD CANNOT MAKE UP FOR WHAT GOD IS DONE BUT THAT IS INCORRECT IF GOD IS OMNIPOTENT HE ABSOLUTELY CAN THE FACT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A POWER A PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD OUT THERE WHICH TOTALLY UPROOTS YOUR FORMER MISGIVINGS ASSUAGES ALL DOUBT AND GRIEVANCES AND MAKES ALL PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED SUFFERING NULL IS PART OF OMNIPOTENCE SINCE CHRISTIANS BELIEVE IN OMNIPOTENCE THE PROBLEM OF EVIL DOES NOT AFFECT THEIR GOD

THE QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU CAN IMAGINE SUCH A POWER OR STATE IS QUITE IRRELEVANT AND CHOOSING TO BELIEVE THAT YOUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY AND YOUR GRASP ON THE POWERS OF LOGIC OR WHATEVER IT MAY PERFECT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY YOUR ARBITRATION OF GOD AS NOT REALLY GOD IS NOTHING BUT HUBRIS IF GOD IS OMNISCIENT HE CLEARLY KNOWS MORE THAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SUPPOSE TO JUDGE IF SUCH A BEING IS ANYTHING WITHOUT SUPPOSING YOUR OWN OMNISCIENCE COMPLAINTS AGAINST GOD SUPPOSE ONE'S OWN PERFECTION IN ORDER TO PERFECTLY JUDGE THE WORLD IMPERFECT AND PERFECTLY CONCLUDE THAT GOD PERFECTION DOES NOT EXIST IT IS A CONTRADICTION THE ARGUMENT DOES NOT WORK

THAT STUFF IS DEFINITELY JUST A BUNCH FABLES AND FAIRYTALES THAT ARE JUST INJECTED INTO A VERY FOGGY DISTANT PAST THERE IS A BIT OF HISTORIC TRUTH IN MOST RELIGIOUS WRITINGS BUT THATS JUST LIKE THE NAMES OF CITIES AND SOME OTHER LITTLE DETAILS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH DOGMA AND SOME POOR SCARED PEASANT GIRL BEING RAPED BY SOMEONE CLAIMING TO BE AN ANGEL OF GOD GROSS

COGNITIVE DISSONANCE PEOPLE ITS LIKE STRETCHING WHEN YOUR WAY OUT OF SHAPE JUST BREATHE THRU THAT SHIT UNCOMFORTABLE AT FIRST BUT SO SO WORTH IT IN THE END LOVE YA
YES BUT THE HANDS OFF GOD OF BUDDHISM IS STILL OK ALSO CALLED NIRVANA ITS WHAT YOU RETURN TO WHEN YOU STEP-OFF THE WHEEL OF REINCARNATION

AND THERE'S STILL THE BUDDHIST WHICH IS NEITHER REWARD NOR PUNISHMENT AND NOT OUR FINAL DESTINATION ITS STILL PART OF THE ILLUSION

BUT YEAH THE CHILDISH VERSION OF GOD WHO HELPS FOLKS SCORE A WINNING TOUCHDOWNS IS NOT REALLY A THING

IF YOU WANNA MANIFEST STUFF YOU GOTTA WORK WITH YOUR OWN BELIEFS AND REPLACE THE LIMITING ONES WITH MORE EMPOWERING ONES

OTHERWISE REALITY IS ONLY HAPPENING TO YOU AND NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE DOING SO YOU'RE PLAYING THE VICTIM

SOME PAPERS FROM PROFESSOR EHRENBERG

A SHORT PHILOSOPHY COMPASS OVERVIEW OF THE USE OF FUNCTIONS IN JURISPRUDENCE IS AT

A MORE DETAILED ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF A NEUTRAL USE OF FUNCTIONS

AN ARGUMENT THAT LAW IS NOT BEST CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIALLY CONTESTED CONCEPT

AN ARGUMENT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANARCHIST OFFICIALS CREATES DIFFICULTIES FOR LEGAL POSITIVISM

OUR NEXT AMA WILL BE BY PROFESSOR GEOFF LYNN NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY ON WEDNESDAY OCTOBER SEE THE FULL SCHEDULE WITH THREE NEW AMAS AT THE GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT POST
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE JURY SYSTEM
I SEE A GREAT NEED FOR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN THE TRIAL PROCESS BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THE AVERAGE CITIZEN IS ILL-EQUIPPED TO BE MAKING SUCH JUDGMENTS
WEALTHY PARTICIPANTS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM CAN AFFORD MORE AND BETTER LAWYERS WHICH OBJECTIVELY ALLOWS FOR A HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF PERFORMING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND RECEIVING LESS OR NO PUNISHMENT IS THERE ANY MEANINGFUL IMPLEMENTABLE WAY TO CHANGE THIS
IT IS OFTEN STATED THAT IGNORANCE OF THE LAW USUALLY CAN'T BE USED AS A DEFENSE ALBEIT DUE TO PRACTICAL REASONS I EAST ANYONE CAN CLAIM IGNORANCE OF LAW TO GET AWAY WITH A CRIME BUT GIVEN THE ABUNDANCE OF LAWS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DON'T SEEM SELF-EVIDENT AND THE LACK OF EDUCATION ON THE PART OF THE STATE TO AT LEAST MAKE THOSE LAWS SOMEWHAT KNOWN AT LEAST FROM WHERE I AM FROM WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT INCRIMINATING A PERSON OF BREAKING SUCH A LAW IS IMMORAL ON THE PART OF THE STATE

DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY IN TERMS OF THE HOBBESIAN TRADITION
IS THE US CONSTITUTION A LIVING BREATHING DOCUMENT WITH FLEXIBLE MEANING OR SHOULD IT BE STRICTLY INTERPRETED ONLY BY THE ACTUAL WORDS WRITTEN AND OTHER STRICT GUIDELINES SUCH AS ORIGINAL INTENT
I AM A MUSIC STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IT'S COOL TO SEE AN AMA FROM SOMEONE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE BROCK TURNER CASE SHOULD HE GAVE GOTTEN OFF AS LIGHT AS HE DID
BEN FRANKLIN SAID LAWS WITHOUT MORALS ARE IN VAIN BUT WHERE SHOULD SOCIETY DRAW THE LINE AT LEGISLATING MORALITY
THE LAW AN OLD DECANTER THAT HAS HAD IT CONTENTS DUMPED AND REFILLED SEVERAL TIMES AS A RESULT OF THE WHIMS OF IT OWNERS
IS THERE MORALITY IN THE LAW OR IS THE LAW JUST A WAY TO MAINTAIN ORDER
IS IT A TOOL OR IS IT A SOCIETAL PHENOMENON
TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR BOOK WOULD I NEED EXTENSIVE PHILOSOPHICAL KNOWLEDGE TO COMPREHEND IT
THIS QUESTION HAS BOTHERED ME SINCE THE HOUSING CRISIS HOW MORAL ETHICAL ARE CONGRESSIONAL BAILOUTS
DO YOU THINK THAT GOVERNMENT AGENTS HAVE MORAL PARITY WITH NON-GOVERNMENT AGENTS OR DO YOU THINK THEY EXIST ON A DIFFERENT HIGHER LOWER MORAL PLANE THAN THE REST OF US

COMMON EXAMPLE ARE THE RULES FOR WHEN I CAN KILL A NON-GOVERNMENT AGENT SELF-DEFENSE ETC WITH WHEN I MAY KILL A GOVERNMENT AGENT MOST SEEM TO THINK THE RULES ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE VIS-A-VIS GOVERNMENT AGENTS
NO QUESTION HERE I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR AWESOME JUSTIFYING LEGAL AUTHORITY COURSE YEARS AGO IT REALLY OPENED MY EYES TO THE FIELD IN GENERAL AND I STILL READ PHILOSOPHY IN MY SPARE TIME FOR FUN KEEP BEING AWESOME
HOW BOUT THEM VOLS
WHAT IN YOUR MIND IS THE CENTRAL THESIS OF LEGAL POSITIVISM

IS IT AS GARDNER ARGUES THAT LEGAL VALIDITY IS ABOUT SOURCES AND NOT MERITS OR RATHER IS IT ABOUT NORMS BEING DERIVED FROM SOCIAL FACTS
I FEEL THAT MORALS AND LAWS ARE NOT ASSOCIATED ANYMORE

MORALS ARE UNWRITTEN GOOD VERSUS EVIL RIGHT VERSUS WRONG PERSONALLY MY MORALS ARE MAJORITY BASED ON THE BIBLE AS AN ALABAMA BIBLE BELT SOUTHERN BAPTIST MY UPBRINGING WAS FILLED WITH THE BEATITUDES

LAWS ARE WRITTEN THEY ARE POSTED LAWS SEEM COLD AND MATTER OF FACT THE BIGGEST FEAR OF BREAKING THE LAW IS GETTING CAUGHT I WOULD SAY A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN THE US BREAK THE LAW EVERYDAY SPEEDING TEXTING AND DRIVING DRINKING AND DRIVING JAYWALKING AND THOSE PESKY LAWS THAT ARE SO OLD THEY ARE OBSOLETE

I FEEL THE DIFFERENCE IS

MORAL DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO TO YOU I DO NOT WANT KILLED RAPED STOLEN FROM TREATED WITH DISRESPECT LOVE ONE ANOTHER GIVE RESPECT HELP YOUR FELLOW MAN OUT


LAW KILLING IS ILLEGAL AND COMES WITH A SENTENCE IN PRISON KILLING DEPENDING ON FACTORS CAN BE A FEW YEARS OR DEATH YOU HAVE YEARS BEFORE TRIAL YOU CAN MAKE A PLEA BARGAIN YOU CAN TURN STATES EVIDENCE ON A DIFFERENT CRIME THE OPTIONS OF GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER IS VAST IF YOU EVEN GET CAUGHT

HOW DO YOU SEE THE FRACTURING OF MORALS AND LAW AFFECTING THE COUNTRY
HAVING GROWN UP IN ALABAMA MY WHOLE LIFE I NEVER THOUGHT MUCH OF UA NOW THAT I'M PLANNING ON APPLYING TO LAW SCHOOLS I'M CONSIDERING IT A LOT MORE DO YOU THINK THE LAW SCHOOL IS GOOD AND FOR STUDENTS THAT ATTEND ARE THEIR JOB PROSPECTS GOOD
DO YOU HAVE ANY STRONG VIEWS ABOUT REFORMING CRIMINAL JUSTICE THROUGH INCREASING TRANSPARENCY ALL ALONG THE PROCESS ANY VIEWS ON THE WORK OF ALASDAIR MACINTYRE I STUDIED WITH HIM
WHAT IS THE WORST CASE OF RACISM YOU HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN IN THE FIELD OF LAW
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON PODCASTS LIKE SERIAL UNDISCLOSED AND THE ATTENTION THAT THEY BRING TO PROBLEMS IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM
SHOULD THE PRINCIPLE OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY BE ABOLISHED AS MANY CORPORATIONS AND WEALTHY PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY ARE WHAT PARTICULAR LEGAL ISSUES DOES YOUR WORK RELATE TO FOR THE LATTER I'M THINKING OF THINGS THAT ARE CURRENT SOCIETAL ISSUES
DID YOU HAPPEN TO WATCH THE RECENT HBO LIMITED SERIES THE NIGHT OF I'M NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE U SOUTH JUDICIAL SYSTEM BUT THAT SHOW PAINTED A PRETTY MURKY PICTURE OF THE TYPES OF MORAL DECISIONS FACED BY ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN THE COURT SYSTEM IN THE END I WAS LEFT FEELING THAT THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE AND TRUTH IN AN ETHICAL EFFECTIVE MANNER OF COURSE THIS IS JUST A TV SHOW SO I'M NOT SURE HOW ACCURATELY IT REFLECTS REALITY BUT MY QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THERE ARE ANY MODELS OF LAW THAT WOULD BE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE IN THE U SOUTH MAYBE FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTRY CULTURE TIME PERIOD
DOES THE EXISTENCE OF LAW NEGATE THE CONCEPT OF BEING
I TOOK COURSES COVERING SIMILAR MATERIAL FROM WENDY ADAM SHAKU AND THEODORE BENDICT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM AND AM NOW ACTUALLY SEEKING ADMISSION AT UA LAW ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY OF THEM

IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT MATTER I HIGHLY SUGGEST JUMPING IN SUPER INTERESTING STUFF
I HOPE THIS ISN'T JUST BIAS BUT IT FEELS LIKE ALABAMA STATE POLITICS IS WELL ABOVE AVERAGE IN THE CORRUPTION NEPOTISM GRAFT AREAS AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT HAS BEEN IMPROVING DO YOU SEE A PATH TO IT GETTING BETTER IN THE FUTURE
DO YOU AGREE WITH OR DEFINITION OF JUSTICE IN THE REPUBLIC AND POLITICS RESPECTIVELY AND WHY
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES PROMISING TO GET SUPREME COURT RULINGS REVERSED CLINTON PROMISING TO REVERSE CITIZENS UNITED TRUMP PROMISING TO REVERSE GAY MARRIAGE RULING AND WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS IF THEY ACTUALLY DID HAVE THE POWER TO REVERSE THESE RULINGS
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE PUBLISHING OF YOUR FIRST BOOK AFTER READING YOUR INTRODUCTION I HAVE A BRIEF FEELING FOR THE PHILOSOPHY EXPOUNDED

I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF YOU ARE A POSITIVIST RATHER THAN A NATURAL LAWYER DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT LAW MUST BE THE PRODUCT OF SOME UNDERLYING AGREEMENT ON THE VALUES OF THE INSTITUTION IF SUCH AGREEMENT IS LOST UPON WHAT GROUND DOES THE LAW ULTIMATELY DERIVE IT'S AUTHORITY

BONUS QUESTION WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT AS A REJECTION OF THE CURRENT STATE OF LAW AND OR LAW ENFORCEMENT
DEAR PROF EHRENBERG

HOW DO YOU THINK POLITICAL AUTHORITY IS JUSTIFIED THAT IS WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR EDICTS LEGITIMATE WHY FOR EXAMPLE CAN GOVERNMENTS REGULATE WHAT I EAT WHAT I PUT IN MY BODY WITH WHOM I CAN ASSOCIATE OR EVEN TAX ME ETC WHILE OTHER PRIVATE CITIZENS WOULD BE LABELED AS CRIMINALS AND EXTORTIONISTS FOR DOING THE SAME THING WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO JUSTIFY THIS MORAL ASYMMETRY

THANK YOU

PAGE SOUTH WHO ARE YOUR FAVORITE PHILOSOPHERS


SOMETHING I'VE BEEN TOYING WITH IS THE JD REALLY NECESSARY I FEEL LIKE IF WE BROKE THE LAW DOWN INTO ITS PRACTICE AREAS CRIMINAL CONSTITUTIONAL TAX ETC AND ISSUED LICENSES FOR EACH PRACTICE AREA RATHER THAN REQUIRING AN EXPENSIVE THREE-YEAR EDUCATION WE'D LOWER THE FINANCIAL BARRIER TO ENTRY AND SOLVE SOME OF THE AS MUCH JUSTICE AS YOU CAN AFFORD ISSUES AS SOMEONE WHO COULDN'T JUSTIFY THE COST OF LAW SCHOOL BUT JUST ARGUED ON FACEBOOK PAGE UNTIL A MASCULINE I HAVE MY OWN BIASES SO I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE MORE OBJECTIVE
YOU HAVE SAID IN YOUR ANSWERS THAT YOU ARE A POSITIVIST BUT YOU HAVE ALSO SAID YOU AGREE THAT MUCH OF THE LAW HAS A MORAL COMPONENT YOU SEEM TO WANT A SORT OF HYBRID ACCOUNT BUT I AM HEARING MORE WAFFLING THAN A CONSISTENT ACCOUNT DO YOU THINK THAT A JUDGE SHOULD CONSIDER MORAL ISSUES WHEN MAKING DECISIONS OR DO YOU THINK THE STABILITY THAT COMES FROM A SYSTEM OF LAW THAT IS MORE STRAIGHTFORWARDLY APPLIED IS IDEAL

ALSO HAVE YOU READ MICHELLE THE NEW JIM CROW DO YOU THINK HER ASSESSMENT OF THE LAW IS ACCURATE IF SO HOW CAN THIS SITUATION BE AMELIORATED

THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AMA
I AM A SOFTWARE ENGINEER MAJOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI STATE I AM IN A CLASS THAT DISCUSSES CYBER LAW AND POLICY I JUST WANTED TO KNOW YOUR OPINION ON THE PATRIOT ACT AND SAFE HARBOR BASICALLY IS IT MORAL TO HAVE THAT MUCH BEING ANALYZED OF OUR OWN US CITIZENS EVEN IF WE JUST COME IN CONTACT WITH A PERSON ON A GOVERNMENT WATCH LIST EVEN IF IT IS FOR PROTECTION PRIVACY OF THE US PEOPLE VS SECURITY
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH FREDERIC SHORT MONOGRAPH THE LAW AND IF SO WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON IT

WHEN WILL INTERSEXES BE AN OPTION ON BIRTH CERTIFICATES FOR INFANTS BORN IN THE USA
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OPINION OF NORTHERN EUROPEAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS THAT SOMEHOW HAVE VERY LENIENT PUNISHMENT AND QUALITY PRISONS AND EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS OF CRIME THIS ALL COMPARED TO THE US

WHO DID MORE FOR THE UNIVERSITY BEAR BRYANT OR NICK SABAN
HI KENNETH

I THINK A LOT ABOUT RAWLS VEIL OF IGNORANCE AS A WAY TO DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE MOST IDEAL SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES I'VE BEEN THINKING PRETTY OFTEN THAT WHILE THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME THINGS WE'D ALL VOTE AGAINST FROM BEHIND THE VEIL LIKE SLAVERY THERE ARE ALSO SOME THINGS THAT ALTHOUGH WE MAY NOT APPRECIATE THEM FROM OUR CURRENT POSITION IN LIFE WE WOULD MAYBE STILL VOTE TO KEEP AS PART OF THE LAW AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO HIRE AN EXPENSIVE LAWYER IF YOU'RE RICH FROM BEHIND THE VEIL YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE POOR OR RICHARD IF YOU'RE POOR BUT ALSO GUILTY THE ABILITY OF RICH PEOPLE TO HIRE EXPENSIVE LAWYERS PROBABLY DOESN'T AFFECT YOU IF YOU'RE RICH AND GUILTY THEN HIRING EXPENSIVE LAWYERS WORKS IN YOUR FAVOR SO EVEN THOUGH AS A MIDDLE CLASS PERSON I THINK IT'S ANNOYING WITH BILLIONAIRES GET OFF IF I HAD THE CHANCE TO DESIGN THE WORLD WITHOUT KNOWING MY PLACE IN IT I MIGHT LEAVE THAT FEATURE IN

CAN YOU THINK OF SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF THINGS ABOUT THE LAW LEGAL SYSTEM THAT ARE UNPOPULAR BUT THAT WE WOULD BE LIKELY TO LEAVE IN FROM BEHIND THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE

COOL THREAD THANKS FOR DOING THIS KENNETH

A COULD A COMPUTER DEVICE EVER BE CREATED TO DETERMINISTICALLY MEASURE THE LEGITIMACY OF AUTHORITY

B AT WHAT POINT DOES LEGITIMATE AUTHORITY GRANT SOMEONE THE MORAL RIGHT TO USE VIOLENCE AGAINST PEOPLE
HI PROF EHRENBERG

I'VE GOT A QUESTION ABOUT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM'S ROLE AS A MECHANISM FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE FIELD I WORK IN SOCIAL CONVENTIONS THERE IS A DEBATE ABOUT THE ROLE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SOCIAL NORMS AND FOR MY DISSERTATION I LATCHED ONTO THE LEGAL EXAMPLE TO TRY AND SHOW HOW UNSETTLED STANDARDS OF ACCOUNTABILITY ARE I WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER YOU AGREE THAT THESE STANDARDS ARE SOMEWHAT UP IN THE AIR WHETHER YOU THINK THIS IS SOMETHING A JUDICIAL SYSTEM SHOULD ADDRESS AND COULD TELL ME WHAT MECHANISMS JUDICIAL SYSTEMS HAVE OR MIGHT HAVE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT SENTENCES MATCH UP TO A STANDARD OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW TO CHOOSE THE STANDARD IN QUESTION

THERE HAS RECENTLY BEEN A LOT OF MEDIA ATTENTION TO CASES WHERE SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDOUBTEDLY GUILTY OF SOME CRIME MANAGE TO USE THE GREATER RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM TO RECEIVE WHAT IS BY MOST STANDARDS VERY LENIENT SENTENCING ETHAN COUCH IS THE BEST KNOWN CASE AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS THIS ONE IN NEW ZEALAND IS THE CLEAREST I KNOW OF WHERE BORED RICH TEENAGERS WENT ON A BURGLARY SPREE JUST FOR KICKS AND ENDED UP WITH VERY LENIENT SENTENCES WHAT IS NICE ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE IS THE JUDGE CITING THE EXTRAORDINARY SUPPORT THE CRIMINALS RECEIVED LET'S TRY AND BRACKET THE LARGE DIFFICULTIES REGARDING WHAT AN APPROPRIATE SENTENCE WOULD BE IN THESE CASES MANY OF THESE CASES INVOLVE YOUNG FIRST OFFENDERS POPULAR OUTCRY OFTEN DEMANDS FAR HIGHER SENTENCES THAN IS EFFECTIVE OR PROPORTIONATE ESPECIALLY WHEN FANNED BY THE MEDIA ETC AND ALSO BRACKET THE CASES WHERE CERTAIN CLASSES OF CONVICTS RECEIVE NOTABLY MORE ONEROUS SENTENCES OFTEN BECAUSE OF A PUBLIC OUTCRY OR VILIFICATION OF SOME ACTS OR THE CLASS OF CONVICT INVOLVED AND JUST CONCENTRATE ON THE FACT THAT OFTEN ENOUGH SENTENCES FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF CONVICTS CAN BE NOTICEABLY MORE LENIENT WITH A RESULTING OUTCRY ABOUT THOSE CONVICTS NOT BEING HELD SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNTABLE

ANOTHER INTERESTING EXAMPLE ONE THAT ISN'T PERHAPS AS PERNICIOUS AS THE WELL-HEELED COMING OFF LIGHTLY IS HOW IN AUSTRALIA CERTAIN ABORIGINALS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF CERTAIN CRIMES ARE GIVEN MORE LENIENT SENTENCES BECAUSE OF THE RECOGNITION THAT THEIR ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES WILL EXACT PUNISHMENT OF THEIR OWN AFTER THE CONVICT SERVED THE SENTENCE RECEIVED IN COURT THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT FOR A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THE COURT ISN'T THE SOLE VENUE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM SHOULD MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR POPULAR STANDARDS OF ACCOUNTABILITY

THANKS IN ADVANCE
IF WE POSTULATE THAT THERE IS NO GOD AND HUMANS CREATED LAWS THEN HOW CAN WE JUSTIFY ANY JUDGMENT ON OUR NATURAL BEHAVIOUR INSTINCTS

EG IF A HUSBAND KILLS HIS WIVES LOVER TO PROTECT HIS TERRITORY FAMILY AND TO PASS ON HIS GENES AS IS ONE OF OUR PRIMAL BEHAVIOURS PROOF COMPLEX DATING AND MATING RITUALS CAN LAWS WE MADE FAIRLY PUNISH HIM FOR WHAT CAN ALMOST BE EXPECTED

FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF OUR HISTORY I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT THE ABOVE IS WHAT HAS BEEN MOST COMMON THROUGHOUT OUR SHORT HISTORY THEREFOR TO FORGIVE WOULD BE ALMOST AN EVOLUTIONARY STEP MEANING THAT TO PUNISH THE MAN FOR KILLING HIS WIVES LOVER WOULD BE TO PUNISH HIM FOR BEING LESS EVOLVED IS THIS JUST OR OUR OWN NEW SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST BY KILLING OF UNDESIRABLE

OPINION
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL TAKE BEFORE ALABAMA DECIDES TO GET IT'S HEAD OUT OF ITS OWN BUTT AND LEGALIZE MEDICAL MARIJUANA

LATE TO THE PARTY

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE LAW BY FREDERIC BASTIA
WHY HAS THE CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES MOVEMENT CEASED TO EXIST AREN'T THE OBSERVATIONS OF DUNCAN KENNEDY CONCERNING PRIVATE LAW FOR EXAMPLE STILL OF RELEVANCE TODAY
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ARE SOME OF THE CURRENT HOT TOPICS IN PHILOSOPHY OF LAW
WHAT SCHOOL OF THOUGHT DO YOU FALL IN ON PHILOSOPHY OF LAW AND WHY
WHAT ARE SOME THOUGHTS AND THEORIES ON THE GLOBALIZATION AND DECENTRALISATION OF LEGAL SYSTEMS I EAST EU BUT ALSO FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS MODELS PREDICTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY A SHORT SUMMARY AND IF YOU HAVE ANY CHOUGHS ON THE SUBJECT IS SUFFICIENT ALSO ANY GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS ON READING MATERIALS ON SUCH THOUGHTS
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON RESTORATIVE JUSTICE
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF CRITICAL LEGAL STUDIES DOES THE CRITIQUE OF RULE OF LAW AS A MYTH HOLD WATER
HOW IS ALA HART SEEN IN THE PROFESSION TODAY MY FATHER STUDIED UNDER HIM AT OXFORD SOME TIME AGO

WHAT'S THE CURRENT DEBATE LIKE ON WHERE LAW GETS ITS AUTHORITY FROM MEANING WHAT ARE THE OPPOSING CAMPS AND WHAT DO THEY BELIEVE
I PULLED A JUDGES OATH OF OFFICE HERE IN DENVER IT CLAIMED ALLEGIANCE TO THE US CONSTITUTION THE STATE CONSTITUTION AND THE CHARTER

I KNOW THE CHARTER REFERS TO THE CORPORATE CHARTER OF THE CORPORATION OF THE STATE CITY AND COUNTY

IT IS IN THE CHARTER THAT ALL THE CODES STATUTES ORDINANCES ARE

KNOWING THAT ONLY AGENTS OR PEOPLE ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE CORPORATION OR PEOPLE THAT AGREE TO ACT AS AN AGENT HAVE TO FOLLOW A CORPORATE CHARTER THINK LIKE THIS ONLY EMPLOYEES HAVE TO FOLLOW CHARTER

KNOWING THAT LAW CONSISTS OF MANY FORMS ACTING SIMULTANEOUSLY I EAST CIVIL CRIMINAL AND CONTRACT ALL ACTING AT SAME TIME

WHERE ARE THE DOCUMENTS THAT INFORM IT'S CITIZENS OF THIS CORPORATE CHARTER THAT THE JUDGES ADHERE TO THAT THEY ASSUME THE PEOPLE ADHERE TO

BECAUSE OF CONTRACT LAW ALWAYS IN EFFECT AND SINCE CITIZENS NOT GIVEN FULL DISCLOSURE ALL DOCUMENTS LINKING ONE TO THE STATE ONLY CONTAIN ONE SIGNATURE YOURS AND NO MEETING OF THE MINDS AND NO EQUAL CONSIDERATION NO WITNESSES

IS IT A FAIR AND VALID ARGUMENT IN YOUR MIND TO CONTEST THAT I OR ANY OTHER CITIZEN WERE NEVER FULLY CONTRACTED WITH THE CORPORATIONS DOING BUSINESS AS THE UNITED STATES STATES AND COUNTIES

HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES IT TAKE TO WITHDRAW CONSENT IF GOVERNMENT IS GIVEN ITS LEGITIMACY FROM THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE I SAY IT ONLY TAKES ONE

WHEN I GO TO COURT I ALWAYS CHALLENGE JURISDICTION CLAIM COMMON LAW AND WITHDRAWAL CONSENT OBJECT TO ALL AND ANYTHING AND ALWAYS REPRESENT MYSELF ASK FOR FACTS EVIDENCE AND WITNESSES THAT I AM AN AGENT OF THE STATE AND TO PROVE ANY CONTRACTS BETWEEN ME AND THE CORPORATIONS

JUST TO REHASH MY QUESTIONS
HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES IT TAKE TO WITHDRAW CONSENT THE SAME CONSENT THAT GIVE GOV IT'S LEGITIMACY TO RULE

AND WHERE IS THE PROOF THAT THE PEOPLE ARE AGENTS OF THE CORPORATION AND BOUND BY THE CHARTER THAT THE JUDGE GIVES ALLIGIENCE TO
NOT SURE IF THIS ENTIRELY ON TOPIC BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR TIME BEFORE BECOMING A PROFESSOR DID YOU SPEND MUCH TIME AFTER YOUR JD IN PRACTICE AND IF SO WHAT DID YOU FOCUS ON

I'M A RECENT LAW GRAD AND I'M HONESTLY NOT SURE IF PRACTICE IS THE PLACE FOR ME I ENJOYED THE ACADEMIC SIDE OF THINGS AND LOVED WORKING ON PAPERS FOR PUBLICATION OR FOR PROFESSORS BUT PRACTICE SO FAR HAS NOT EXCITED ME QUITE THE SAME WAY GRANTED SUPER EARLY IN A CAREER BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR TRANSITION FROM JD TO PROFESSOR
HOW CAN WE CREATE BETTER EQUAL OPPORTUNITY LEGISLATION WITHOUT COMING OF AS PATERNALISTIC

EDIT I KIND OF ASSUMED YOU FIND CURRENT LEGISLATION PATERNALISTIC WHERE I SHOULD HAVE ASKED IF YOU FELT THAT WAY AND FOLLOWED UP
I LOVE PHILOSOPHY WITH ALL MY HEART BUT AS A UNDERGRADUATE HISTORY STUDENT I NEVER FAIL TO SEE THE UNWILLINGNESS OF PEOPLE TO FOLLOW CERTAIN IDEALS OR DECISIONS THAT ULTIMATELY ARE FOR A GREATER GOOD BEING THAT SAID MY QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THERE IS A WAY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE INTO THE ACTS FOR A GREATER GOOD OR THINK OF A WAY THAT THE CORRUPTED SYSTEM SOMEHOW AVOIDS HUMAN INTERRUPTION TO WORK FOR A GREATER GOOD
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT OUR HEALTH CARE LAWS ARE THEY FINE HOW THEY ARE OR DO THEY NEED TO CHANGE TO BRING THE COST DOWN TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE IF SO WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO ACCOMPLISH THAT
WHAT'S 2 WAYS YOU'D MAKE THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE BETTER
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF AI BASED LEGAL ASSISTANCE SUCH ROSS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD
IF YOU COULD HAVE THE GENERAL PUBLIC UNDERSTAND ONE THING ABOUT THE LAW WHAT WOULD IT BE
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE RECENT WIKI LEAKS SHOWING LAWLESS BEHAVIOR AND THE FBI AND DOJ DECIDING NOT TO PURSUE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS HAS TO SAY ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AT AND WHERE WE ARE HEADING CONCERNING LAW IN THESE CASES OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO OPERATE OUTSIDE OF WHAT IS CONDUCTED LEGAL AND ILLEGAL
THIS LOOKS LIKE A FASCINATING BOOK

I AM CURIOUS AS TO YOUR OPINION ON LAW A FORM OF LAW PROMOTED BY AND ANARCHISTS AS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE CENTRALIZED AND MONOPOLIZED LEGAL SYSTEM THAT WE CURRENTLY USE I USED TO BE A STRONG BELIEVER IN THIS KIND OF APPROACH TO LAW BUT I AM BEGINNING TO HAVE MY DOUBTS THAT SUCH A DECENTRALIZED LAW SYSTEM WOULD WORK AND WOULD LIKE TO IDENTIFY THE BEST ARGUMENTS PRO AND CON FOR EACH SIDE IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS VERY LITTLE SOLID SCHOLARSHIP ON EITHER WAY IS LAW CONSIDERED A FRINGE THEORY THAT PHILOSOPHERS OF LAW WON'T TOUCH
WHAT IS THE REALISTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROBABLE CAUSE AND REASONABLE SUSPICION I'M A NEW HIGH SCHOOL SPEECH AND DEBATE COACH AND THIS IS RELEVANT FOR OUR CURRENT DEBATE TOPIC BUT THE DISTINCTIONS SEEM ARBITRARY BOTH SEEM LIKE SUBJECTIVE FRAMEWORKS WITH VERY DIFFERENT RAMIFICATIONS
CAN YOU PERHAPS RECOMMEND SOME GOOD INTRODUCTORY BOOKS ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW ALSO DOES THE JURY SYSTEM IMPROVE THE ACT OF JUSTICE IN ANY WAY AS OPPOSED TO THE CONTINENTAL SYSTEM IS IT REASONABLE TO EXPECT UNTRAINED PEOPLE TO DELIVER AN OBJECTIVE JUDGEMENT IN A COMPLEX MATTER
CAN PEOPLE WITH VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON INDIVIDUAL ETHICS COME TO AGREEMENT ON MANY SALIENT ISSUES IN LEGAL MORALITY
WHAT SORT OF ETHICAL ISSUES ARE EMERGING IN THE LEGAL FIELD THAT REQUIRE ATTENTION AND ACTION THANKS
GRADUATE FROM ALABAMA WITH A PHILOSOPHY DEGREE HERE ALTHOUGH I WAS GOING DOWN THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND SIDE OF THINGS

THAT SAID WHICH PHILOSOPHER IN YOUR DEPARTMENT DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TAKE ON IN A DEBATE
HOW IS THE METHODOLOGY OF PHILOSOPHY OF LAW DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY NAMELY PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS OR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE JURY SYSTEM I SEE A GREAT NEED FOR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN THE TRIAL PROCESS BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THE AVERAGE CITIZEN IS ILL-EQUIPPED TO BE MAKING SUCH JUDGMENTS
DO YOU THINK THAT IN OUR CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM IT IS CORRECT TO HAVE JUDGE WHO MAKES A SENTENCE VS HAVING OR JUDGES DECIDING ON THE SENTENCE WOULD THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM WHERE WE ARE FOUND GUILTY BY OUR PEERS BUT SENTENCED BY OUR SUPERIORS
PRIVATE PROPERTY MORE SPECIFICALLY LAND AND WHAT IS BUILT ON TOP OF IT CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT VIOLENCE OR THE THREAT THEREOF HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY THERE HAD TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO CLAIM THE UNCLAIMED LAND THEY COULD HAVE CLAIMED AN UNREASONABLY LARGE TERRITORY LIKE ALL OF AUSTRALIA IT SEEMS THAT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO MIGHT MAKES RIGHT EAST G WHOEVER HAS THE BIGGEST STICK GETS TO OWN THE MOST BEST LAND YOUR THOUGHTS

IF I OWN A PIECE OF LAND HOW MUCH OF THE AIRSPACE ABOVE ME SHOULD I CONTROL AND HOW DEEPLY DOWN SHOULD IT STILL MY LAND WHY

DOLPHINS AND WHALES ARE PRETTY DARN SMART THEY SEEM TO SPEAK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES AND LISTEN TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT INTERRUPTION THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS WE ARE YET TO DISCOVER ABOUT THEM SHOULD THEY HAVE PROPERTY RIGHTS OTHER LEGAL PROTECTION IF IT TURNS OUT THAT A DOLPHIN OR BELUGA WHALE OR AN ORCA OR A WHALE IS ABLE TO SPEAK A LANGUAGE AND WE LEARN HOW TO DECODE IT SHOULD A TESTIMONY OF SUCH CREATURE BE CONSIDERED AS VALID EVIDENCE IN A HUMAN COURT SHOULD TESTIMONY OF A HUMAN BE VALID EVIDENCE IN A DOLPHIN COURT

HOW TRUE IS ALL THE SOVEREIGN CITIZENS THEORIES ON THE LAW AND THEIR ABILITY TO MANIPULATE IT
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM COULD BE AUTOMATED OR STANDARDIZED ALTHOUGH ALL ENCOMPASSING THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST COULD CITE A LACK OF CONTEXT AND COMPLEXITY THAT HUMANS RENDER WHILE THE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR COULD CITE THE LACK OF BIAS AND SIMPLE HUMAN ERROR
DO YOU FEEL A PHILOSOPHY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IS A GOOD BASIS FOR LAW SCHOOL THATS MY CURRENT PATHWAY AND I'M NOT SURE IF I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE
GOOD MORNING MR EHRENBERG

HOW DO WE DECIDE IF SOMETHING IS MORAL IS THERE A SPECIFIC SET OF GUIDELINES THAT A CONCEPT HAS TO ADHERE TO QUALIFY AS MORAL IF NOT HOW DO WE MAKE THAT DECISION

I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE CONTEXT OF VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA HOW DO WE DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A MORAL OR ETHICAL PROCEDURE
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMERICAN RULE OF ATTORNEYS FEES SHOULD THE LOSER OF A LAWSUIT HAVE TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE WINNER DOES THE CURRENT SYSTEM PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO FILE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS
LOVE FROM MOBILE AL

I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE ANALYTIC CONTINENTAL DISTINCTION IN PHILOSOPHY ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO YOUR AREA OF STUDY AND 2 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ANARCHISM AS A LEGITIMATE AREA OF POLITICAL INQUIRY
IS THE WAY WE CONCEPTUALIZE WHAT IS A HARM TOO RIGID SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO HARM IN THE CONTEXT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ORIGINALIST POSITION HAS PREVAILED IN THE COURTS AND THE UNIVERSE OF POSSIBLE HARMS IS RESTRICTED TO THOSE CONCEIVABLE BY PERSONS IN A STRICTLY INDIVIDUALISTIC SENSE

THANKS FOR THE AMA
I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T MIND IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A PERSON TO DIE AND PASS ON THEIR DEBT TO SURVIVING FAMILY CAN A PERSON FIGHT THAT DEBT AND NOT ACCEPT IT AS IT IS NOT THEIRS ORIGINALLY
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW
WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE LAW
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE HUMAN BEING HAS RIGHTS REGARDLESS THE EXISTENCE OF LAWS AND A LEGAL SYSTEM TO ENFORCE THEM DO YOU BELIEVE THE INVERSE PREMISE BASED ON YOUR OWN STUDIES

DO YOU BELIEVE LIKE ROUSSEAU THAT THE HUMAN BEINGS ARE INHERENTLY RIGHTEOUS AND GOOD THEN CORRUPTED BY THE SOCIETY THAT THE LAWS ARE GIVEN TO US BY NATURE AND REGARDLESS OF OUR ABILITY TO WRITE THEM INTERPRET THEM AND DEFEND THEM WE'RE BOUND TO THEM OR DO YOU BELIEVE IN A MORE MACHIAVELLIAN HUMANITY IS COMPOSED BY BEASTS THAT SEEK ADVANTAGE OF THEIR PEER WEAKNESSES SO WE MUST WRITE AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE

DO YOU THINK THAT THE LEVIATHAN STATE MODEL IS STILL PLAUSIBLE

DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME FOR A PROFOUND REVISION OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM THROUGH PREVENTIVE ORIENTED MECHANISMS THAT REFLECTS PEOPLE'S NEED BEFORE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED OR IS THE REPRESSIVE SOMEWHAT DISPROPORTIONATE SYSTEM A RELIABLE ONE

OUR PERCEPTION OF RIGHT AND WRONG MUTATES AS FAST AS THE HUMAN NEEDS CHANGE FAIR AND UNFAIR SUFFER THE SAME FATE AS JUST AND UNJUST DOES AREN'T WE BOUND TO CRITICIZE OPENLY OUR BEHAVIOR SO WE CAN BETTER DIRECT OUR ACTIONS TOWARDS THE BEST OPTION WITHOUT HAVING TO RULE OUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE CHOICES

EITHER FROM A IUSNATURALISTIC OR IUSMATERIALISTIC PERSPECTIVE LEGAL SYSTEMS SHOULD EXIST TO PROPERLY REGULATE HUMAN BEHAVIOR AREN'T WE OVER SATURATED WITH CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS LAWS DISPOSITIONS DECREES RULINGS INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS PROTOCOLS AND YET WE FAIL TO REDUCE THE CORE PROBLEMS OF OUR INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIETY

I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE CONCEPT OF A PATENT

I WANT TO START WITH A LITTLE BACKGROUND INFORMATION THERE WAS A LOOOONG DISCUSSION ABOUT WHO INVENTED CALCULUS NEWTON OR LEIBNIZ



IN THE END WE CONCLUDED THEY INVENTED IT INDEPENDENTLY FROM EACH OTHER GIVEN THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IN OUR MODERN WORLD IS USING CALCULUS THIS WAS QUITE A BIG INVENTION WITH NEARLY UNPAIRED IMPACT ON HUMANITY TESLA HAD SOME BIG THINKING AS WELL



I THINK WITH THIS EXAMPLE IT IS SAVE TO CONCLUDE AN INVENTION THOUGHT CAN EMERGE IN MORE THAN ONE PERSON SIMULTANEOUSLY

NOW I SERIOUSLY DO NOT GET OUR

HOW CAN ANY PATENT HOLD SHOULDN'T EVERY COURT RULE IN DOUBT FOR THE DEFENDANT IN FACT IT HAS TO RULE THIS WAY HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT SOMEONE DID NOT HAVE THE IDEA



OR IS THIS THIS IS ORIGINALLY MY THOUGHT INVENTION JUST SOME BULLSHIT ARGUMENT AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT IN THE YOU JUST GET THE PATENT IF YOU RUSH TO THE OFFICE FIRST EVEN IF YOU STOLE THE IDEA FROM SOMEONE ELSE



I WOULD RLY LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS IS HANDLED

I MYSELF CAN'T FIND ANY LOGICAL ARGUMENT THAT CAN HOLD PLACE TO DEFEND A PATENT IN ANY THEORETICAL SITUATION
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ARGUMENT THAT LEGAL INSTRUMENTALITY THREATENS THE RULE OF LAW

EDIT I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS GOT DOWNVOTED IT SEEMS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT GIVEN THAT THE PROFESSOR'S BOOK IS CALLED THE FUNCTIONS OF LAW

THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS

WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE MORALITY AND AUTHORITY SURROUNDING BREAKING OF PRIVILEGE IN CASES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES DRUGS ALCOHOL PTSD CRAVINGS TENDENCIES ETC IN CASES OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT

FOR EXAMPLE IF A DOCTOR OR NURSE IS ACCUSED OF USING DRUGS OR EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE MEDICAL REGULATORY BODY UNDER THE POWER OF LAW TO HOLD THEIR LICENSE HOSTAGE IF THEY DO NOT SIGN CONSENT FORMS ALLOWING THE REGULATOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACCESS THEIR MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORDS TO MONITOR IF THEY ARE GETTING BETTER

IN PARTICULAR I'M CURIOUS OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN PUBLIC SAFETY IN MONITORING THEIR PROGRESS VS THE REDUCTION IN EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENT THAT MONITORING CREATES THAT IS PROFESSIONALS MAY NOT BE OPEN AND HONEST WITH THEIR DOCTORS THERAPISTS WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR NOT BECAUSE IN THE BACK OF THEIR MIND BIG BROTHER IS LISTENING IN OR PROFESSIONALS MAY NOT SEEK HELP IN THE FIRST PLACE KNOWING THAT THE INFORMATION COULD FIND ITS WAY TO THE REGULATORY BODY

I KNOW REGULATORY BODIES ARE NOT THE SAME AS LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT THEY ARE BOTH ENABLED BY LEGISLATION AND ACT TO ENFORCE THEIR RULES BUT ARE LIMITED BY WHAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO UNDER LAW AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACTS AS A LEGAL PUNISHMENT SUCH AS REMOVING THE RIGHT TO WORK IN YOUR FIELD AT GREAT FINANCIAL COST

THANK YOU

WHY DO PHILOSOPHY PHS THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO CALL THEMSELVES PHILOSOPHERS

A KID RUMINATING ON THE TASTE OF CRAYONS IS NOT A PHILOSOPHER

A TEENAGER WRITING ANGST LIFE POETRY ISN'T A PHILOSOPHER

ARISTOTLE WAS A PHILOSOPHER LEIBNIZ WAS A PHILOSOPHER

PHILOSOPHER IS A TITLE BESTOWED BY HISTORY ISN'T IT
WHAT ARE UR THOUGHTS ON A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO CHOOSING THE JURY SHOULD THAT BENCH BE CHOSEN AND PICKED OR JUST RANDOMLY CHOSEN AND LIKE IT OR NOT WELL THAT'S THEM RANDOMLY BEING KEY WORD THERE IF THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLY IS THE JURY NOT THE LAST FAIR PRACTICE THAT OUR U SOUTH JUDICIAL SYSTEM IMPLICATES SERIOUSLY ASKING HERE IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A SYSTEM BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE FOLKS WITH THE MEANS TO DO SO AT THIS POINT

AS A MATH STUDENT EVERYTHING IN THIS POST IS TRUE BUT IT'S ALSO PRETTY COMMON KNOWLEDGE AMONG MATHEMATICIANS WHO WILL OFTEN DEFINE THEIR FIELD AS BEING THE SET OF ALL THINGS YOU CAN DISCOVER THROUGH REASON ALONE

HOWEVER AS GODEL PROVED AND AS PEOPLE SUSPECTED LONG BEFORE THEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD A SOPHISTICATED MATHEMATICAL SYSTEM WHICH WOULD BE A PHILOSOPHICAL ANALOGUE TO A REASONABLY COMPLETE VIEW OF THE WORLD USING PURE REASON INSTEAD YOU MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND SEE WHERE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS WILL TAKE YOU BUILDING A DIFFERENT MATHEMATICAL SYSTEM FOR EACH SET OF ASSUMPTIONS THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL TRUTH THAT CAN BE DISCOVERED THROUGH REASON ALONE AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS FACT HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH EXTENSIVELY BY THINKERS LIKE PEIRCE AND MANY OTHERS

IN FACT A LOT OF MODERN MATHEMATICS DEALS WITH THESE ASSUMPTIONS OF SEARCHING FOR THE MINIMAL SET OF ASSUMPTIONS IN ORDER FOR CERTAIN PROPERTIES TO HOLD AND IT IS NOT HARD TO DO SIMILAR ANALYSIS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES BY LOOKING FOR THE KEY DISTINCTIONS THAT LEAD TO DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE WORLD
THE WHOLE IS THE FALSE
WHENEVER I ENCOUNTER MACHINE I AM REMINDED OF THE WISDOM OF THE FRENCH EXISTENTIALIST PRINCIPLES AS A HUMAN IT IS BETTER TO SATISFY THE EXISTENTIAL CRAVING FOR BEING THAN IT IS TO INDULGE IN IMMEDIATE HEDONISM PEOPLE ARE OFTEN WILLING TO SACRIFICE HEDONISM ENTIRELY AND BY THAT I MEAN SUFFER IN ORDER TO BE SOMETHING IT IS TELLING THAT MANY OF THE MOST PROMINENT FOLKLORES DEMONSTRATE EXACTLY THAT THINK OF JESUS CHRIST ON THE CROSS OR THE STAND AT THERMOPYLAE OR A LOT OF POPULAR HOLLYWOOD FILMS AND SO ON TIME AND TIME AGAIN THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY PEOPLE SWIFTLY GIVE UP EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO DEFEND AN IDEA AND THUS BE A PERSON WHO DEFENDS THAT IDEA
AT THE END OF THE VIDEO THE AUTHOR MAKES AN ARGUMENT AGAINST HEDONISM WITH HIS SECOND POINT BEING 2 BUT IS IS BETTER FOR US TO DO THESE THINGS THAN TO MERELY HAVE THE ILLUSION OF DOING THESE THINGS I AM NOT SURE THAT THIS IS A VALID POINT BECAUSE THE MEANING OF BETTER IN NOT CLEARLY DEFINED SUPPOSE A PERSON AND HIS TWIN ARE SEPARATED AT BIRTH THE FIRST TWIN LIVES OUT A LIFE WITH MANY EXPERIENCES IN THE REAL WORLD THE SECOND TWIN IS KEPT IN AN EXPERIENCE MACHINE BUT HAS THE SAME MENTAL EXPERIENCES AS THE FIRST TWIN FEED INTO THEM BY THE MACHINE ON THE LAST HOUR OF THEIR LIVES AT THE AGE OF NINETY-FIVE THE TWO TWINS MEET FACE TO FACE IN AN EMPTY ROOM CAN EITHER ONE SAY THAT THEIR IDENTICAL EXPERIENCE WAS BETTER THAN THAT OF THE OTHER

FIRST EXAMPLE MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS OF BREAKING A PROMISE IT PROVES HEDONISM WORKS AS A LEGITIMATE WAY TO KEEP FROM PAIN WHICH IS THEREFORE BETTER FOR US

YOU SAID HAVING A FAMILY AND HAVING CHILDREN WAY TOO MANY TIMES ITS DISTRACTING AND HARD TO LISTEN TO

FINAL CONCLUDING POINT HAS VERY WEAK GROUNDS AND BACKING

CLAIM GROUNDS ARRENT BACKING CONCLUSION REBUTTAL MOULMEIN WAS A SMART ONE DONT LET ME TELL YOU WHY YOU'RE WRONG DISPELL COUNTER ARGUMENTS BEFORE THEY EVEN OCCUR YOUR ARGUMENT WILL BE MUCH STRONGER MORE COHESIVE MUCH EASIER TO PICK UP AND AGREE WITH HOW YOU STRUCTURE YOUR ARGUMENT IS ULTIMATELY UP TO YOU BUT YOU HAVE A MOULMEIN ARGUMENT CURRENTLY THAT IS INCOMPLETE JUST LOOK AT THE YOUTUBE COMMENTS THEY ALL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY BECAUSE OF THESE HOLES YOU LEFT

I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION HERE SUBJECTIVELY I FEEL AS IF I DO HAVE FREE WILLIAM IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS AN INCOMMUNICABLE QUALIA OF FREE WILLIAM IF SOMEONE PUNCHES ME AND I SAY THAT HURTS I'VE MADE A TRUE STATEMENT THAT CAN'T BE DENIED AS TRUE FROM SOMEONE OUTSIDE MYSELF LIKEWISE I'VE SEEN A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT SAY FREE WILL DOES NOT OBJECTIVELY EXIST BUT EVEN IF THIS WERE TRUE HOW CAN IT DENY MY QUALIA FROM BEING TRUE ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT ALL COMMUNICABLE OBJECTIVITY IS DEPENDENT ON THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN MINDS THAT CONTAIN A SUBJECTIVE QUALIA IT SEEMS IRONIC AND PERHAPS CONTRADICTORY THAT ALL THE SCIENTISTS DENYING FREE WILL EXISTS HAVE THIS QUALIA OF FREE WILLIAM SO IF WE ARE GOING TO SAY ONLY ONE TRUTH EXISTS IT SEEMS WE ARE PRESUPPOSING FREE WILL EXISTS IN ORDER TO DISPROVE IT OR DENYING THAT QUALIA MATTERS FOR TRUTH AS SUCH CAN SOMEONE HELP ME ON THIS
THIS BORDERS ON MISLEADING TITLE
I PERSONALLY FIND IT THOUGHT PROVOKING TO ATTEMPT TO CODIFY MY OWN THOUGHTS ON FREE WILL BY WORKING BACKWARDS IN SOME WAY GIVEN A PREMISE WHICH DON'T SEEM OVERLY OBJECTIONABLE

CONSCIOUS THOUGHT AND BY EXTENSION FREE WILL I THINK IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT A BRAIN IN QUOTES CAUSE I REALLY MEAN SOME SORT OF NETWORKED UNIT SOME WAY OF COMMUNICATING INFORMATION OVER SPACE IE NEURONS

FROM HERE ALL I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF IS WHETHER I SEE ANY EVIDENCE OR HOLD ANY BELIEF THAT A ROUNDWORM HAS FREE WILLIAM I PERSONALLY DON'T BUT I'M OPEN TO THE IDEA THAT IT DOES A NERVOUS SYSTEM IS COMPOSED OF ROUGHLY NEURONS IN A SMALL NETWORK

TAKING THAT FREE WILL IF IT EXISTS IN MORE COMPLEX ORGANISMS AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OUR PREVIOUS PREMISE THAT FREE WILL REQUIRES SOME KIND OF BRAIN I FEEL THE ONLY EXPLANATION IN SUCH A CASE IS THAT FREE WILL MUST BE AN EMERGENT PROPERTY OF SIMPLY MAKING A NEURONAL NETWORK MORE COMPLICATED

PERSONALLY THE NOTION THAT SOME SORT OF SPONTANEOUS PROPERTY WOULD ARISE FROM SUCH A SYSTEM SEEMS RELATIVELY BASELESS BUT AGAIN AM OPEN TO DIFFERING INTERPRETATIONS MAKING SOMETHING MORE COMPLEX DOESN'T CHANGE IT'S FUNDAMENTAL NATURE IF IT'S FUNCTIONING BECOMES MORE COMPLEX AND ARCANE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT TAKES ON A LIFE OF IT'S OWN WHICH TO ME IS WHAT FREE WILL SUGGESTS

AND OF COURSE IF WE WANT TO DISAGREE ON THE PREMISE THEN THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION IS MOOT
I FIND A PROBLEM WITH THE FIRST EXPERIMENT MENTIONED IT RELIES ON SUBJECTS THE TIME THEY FELT THEY HAD MADE THE DECISION THIS WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO LOOK AT THE TIMEPIECE AND THEN FOR THE TIME TO REGISTER IN THEIR MIND THOSE WHO HAVE STUDIED PSYCHOLOGY KNOW THAT THERE IS A LARGER DELAY THEN ONE MIGHT THINK

AS SUCH THE FIGURE OF MILLISECONDS IS CERTAINLY OFF IF NOT ENTIRELY WRONG

EDIT I SAY PSYCHOLOGY BECAUSE I FIRST CAME ACROSS THIS FACT IN A PSYCHOLOGY TEXTBOOK
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE CONCEPTS INVOLVED CONSCIOUS INTENTIONS VOLUNTARY DECISIONS FREE DECISIONS HAVE NO CLEAR AND SHARED DEFINITION

THIS IS TRUE PRECISELY BECAUSE THE CONCEPT OF FREE WILL IS OVERTHOUGHT

AGREE OR DISAGREE BUT AS A SUBJECT OF PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE IT IS LONG PAST ITS BURIAL DATE
ACCORDING TO A LONG-STANDING PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITION IF SOMEONE WAS NOT FREE WHEN THEY DID SOMETHING THEY CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DEED

THIS IS IN A MORAL SENSE WITH CERTAIN THEORIES OF PUNISHMENT IT MIGHT STILL BE APPROPRIATE FROM SEVERAL PERSPECTIVES TO CONFINE A PERSON WITHOUT FREE WILL WHO HAS TRANSGRESSED OR TO ASSAY FINES AGAINST THEM ETC FOR INSTANCE A DEDICATED KILLWORT WITHOUT FREE WILL IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE TO DISMANTLE IT

THE THIRD CONDITION IS THE RESPONSIVENESS TO REASONS A DECISION CAN T BE FREE IF IT IS THE EFFECT OF A RANDOM CHOICE BUT IT MUST BE RATIONALLY MOTIVATED IF I ROLL A DICE TO DECIDE WHOM TO MARRY MY CHOICE CANNOT BE SAID TO BE FREE EVEN THOUGH I WILL FREELY CHOOSE TO SAY I DO

YOUR DECISION TO ROLL DICE TO CHOOSE A PARTNER WAS FREE

WE CAN DISTINGUISH DEGREES OF FREE WILL ACCORDING TO THE IMPACT THAT SOURCES OF RANDOMNESS HAVE ON IT IF THERE'S A REMOTE CHANCE THAT TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS CAUSE ME TO CHOOSE THE LESS PREFERRED OF TWO NEARLY EQUIVALENT OPTIONS MY WILL ISN'T AS FREE AS IT WOULD BE WITHOUT THAT TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATION BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS RELATIVELY MINOR ON THE OTHER HAND IF MY ACTIONS ARE ENTIRELY RANDOM OF THE TIME THAT'S A LARGE PROBLEM FOR MY FREE WILLIAM

EXPERIMENTS

THESE SHOW THAT FOR VERY SIMPLE DECISIONS WE'RE NOT GOOD AT JUDGING WHEN PRECISELY WE CHOSE TO MAKE THE DECISION SOME OF THE DECISIONS INVOLVED WERE RANDOM AND OTHERS INVOLVED REACTION TIMES

I FIRST EXERCISE MY WILL TO DETERMINE THAT I WILL DO SOMETHING UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES LATER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR AND I DO THE THING I'VE AUTOMATED PART OF MY WILL FOR MORE EFFICIENT REACTIONS THAT'S AWESOME BUT IT'S NOT REALLY AN ARGUMENT AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF FREE WILLIAM

CHILDREN WHO WAITED LONGER FOR THE THEIR REWARDS TENDED TO HAVE BETTER LIFE OUTCOMES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS

THIS SUGGESTS THAT WHATEVER PROPERTY ENABLES SOME CHILDREN TO WAIT LONGER IS CONSISTENTLY PRESENT THROUGHOUT LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT MIGHT BE SOME PART OF THEIR WILL THAT THEY'RE BORN WITH

SO THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING STUFF IN THE ARTICLE BUT I DON'T THINK IT REALLY TOUCHES ON FREE WILLIAM
FIRST WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE CLAIM I HAVE FREE WILL TO UNDERSTAND THE CLAIM YOU MUST DEFINE FREE WILL AND I LET'S DEFINE I AS HAVING FREE WILL IF ACTIONS TAKEN BY AN I ARE NOT ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON ITS INPUTS IF I IS DEFINED AS MY PHYSICAL BODY INCLUDING SOMETHING AKIN TO A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR IN MY BRAIN AND PART OF THE I THEN NOBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO ARGUE THAT I DOES NOT HAVE FREE WILLIAM HOWEVER WE COULD ALSO DEFINE I AS THE EXPERIENCER OF THE QUALIA THAT ARISE FROM THAT SAME PHYSICAL EXPERIENCES IN THIS CASE WE ALSO HAVE TO ASK IF THE EXPERIENCER CAN INFLUENCE CURRENT OR FUTURE ACTIONS OF THE BODY IN A WAY I EAST IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO ACT IN A WAY THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON ITS EXPERIENCES THIS WOULD BE SO IF EACH QUANTUM COLLAPSE PRESENTS CONSCIOUSNESS WITH A SET OF CHOICES THAT ARE ACTED ON IN A WAY AND IF CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE EXPERIENCER THE BOTTOM LINE MAY BE THAT BRAIN EXPERIMENTS WILL REVEAL NOTHING AND THAT WE NEED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CONSCIOUSNESS

I THINK THERE IS ANOTHER DEFINITION OF FREE WILL THAT DEALS WITH WHETHER YOUR BODY HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKE ACTIONS BASED ON INPUTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY SOMEONE ELSE HAVING THE EXACT SAME INPUTS THE NEXT LEVEL IS TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION OF TRULY IDENTICAL TWINS SAME BODIES HOWEVER MOST PEOPLE WOULD STOP SHORT OF TWO PEOPLE WITH IDENTICAL MINDS THIS MEANS WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THE ACTIONS OF THE MIND WHETHER THIS EQUATES TO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS OR NOT AND WHETHER IT IS SEPARABLE FROM THE BODY

IF WE DON'T FRAME OUR QUESTIONS PROPERLY WE CAN END UP IN VERY LONG FRUITLESS DISCUSSIONS
REMOVED
ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS SEEM TO INDICATE THAT FREE WILL IS AN ILLUSION

NO IT DOESN'T NONE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS DEAL WITH DECISIONS THAT ARE CONSCIOUSLY MADE SO OF COURSE THE CONSCIOUS RECOLLECTION IS GOING TO BE FUNKY

LET ME KNOW WHEN THE HIGH SCHOOL KID MAKES A DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO MAJOR IN IN COLLEGE WITHOUT CONSCIOUS THOUGHT AND FREE WILLIAM LET ME KNOW WHEN THE RESEARCHERS CAN PUT A NEURAL CAP ON YOUR HEAD AND FIGURE OUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR NEXT RESEARCH STUDY

EDIT TO CLARIFY SINCE THERE SEEMS SOME CONFUSION THE EXPERIMENTS ARE ALONG THE LINES OF SOMEONE STEPS IN FRONT OF YOUR CAR YOU SLAM ON THE BRAKES BUT YOU'RE UNABLE TO DETERMINE CORRECTLY WHETHER YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HITTING THE BRAKES BEFORE YOU HIT THEM FROM THAT THEY CONCLUDE NOBODY THINKS ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING WHILE THEY'RE DRIVING IT'S ALL REFLEX

EVEN IF CONSCIOUS DECISION IS AN ILLUSION WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DECISIONS BASED ON TIME SCALES OF TENTHS OF SECONDS YOU CAN'T LEAP FROM THAT TO THINKING CONSCIOUS DECISIONS ARE AN ILLUSION WHEN BASED ON TIME SCALES OF TENS OF WEEKS

ALSO ITT PHILOSOPHERS GETTING ALL HUNG UP ON THEIR DEFINITION OF FREE WILL WITHOUT ACTUALLY READING THE PAPER AND SEEING WHAT THE SCIENTISTS ACTUALLY MEAN BY IT WHICH HAS ZERO TO DO WITH DETERMINISTIC VS
I JUST WENT DYSLEXIC FOR A SECOND AND THOUGHT IT SAID WILL FERREL

TL R WAS REALLY HAPPY THEN DISAPPOINTED
HOW FREEDOM IS POSSIBLE IN A WORLD RULED BY PHYSICAL DETERMINISM

SINCE WHEN WAS PHYSICAL DETERMINISM PROVEN
IF WE DEFINE FREE WILL AS A FEATURE OF AN INDIVIDUAL DON'T WE HAVE TO DOUBT THE INTEGRITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IF WE ARE GOING TO DOUBT FREE WILL AFTER ALL IF WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY IN CONTROL WHO OR WHAT IS IT IS OUR COMMUNAL NATURE THAT ENABLES OUR MINDS TO SUBCONSCIOUSLY ABSORB BEHAVIORS VALUES AND THOUGHTS FROM THOSE AROUND US AND WHILE SOME OF US ARE UNABLE TO RECOGNIZE THIS PROCESS MANY OF US DO OF THEM MANY ARE HELPLESS AGAINST IT BUT SOME OF US ARE NOT OF THEM SOME ARE EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT ABLE TO ESTABLISH ROUTINES AND HABITS OF THEIR CHOOSING THAT TURN THEM INTO A PERSON THEY WANT TO BE
REMOVED
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP THAT REPORTS THAT THE DECISION TO DO AN ACT OCCURS BEFORE WE ARE AWARE OF IT
AND THE ARTICLE NEVER THAT I SEE ADDRESSES THE EXACT EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

ISN'T THE REPORTING OF THE INTENT ITSELF A CONSCIOUS ACT WITH ITS OWN INTENTION AND DELAYS

SO WHICH HAPPENS FIRST THE DECISION TO DO THE ACT OR THE DECISION TO REPORT IT

AND WHAT IS THE DELAY BETWEEN THE DECISION TO REPORT AND THE ACTUAL REPORT
REMOVED
WHY DOES THIS SUB STILL ALLOW THIS REGURGITATED HORSESHIT

WE KNOW APRIORI THAT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS ARE EITHER DETERMINISTIC EVERYTHING POINTS IN THIS DIRECTION WHICH DE FACTO ELIMINATES THE CONCEPT OF FREE WILL OR IT IS INTRINSICALLY STOCHASTIC EQUALLY ELIMINATING CHOICE SO WE CAN DISMISS FREE WILL ON THIS BASIS UNEQUIVOCALLY YET THIS TOPIC IS THE SINGLE MOST DISCUSSED HERE WHY PATHETIC
SURE IS HARD TO DEFINE ALRIGHT BUT LETS TRY AGAIN
RADICAL BEHAVIORISM HAS AN INCREDIBLY EMPIRICAL DETERMINISTIC PARSIMONIOUS ACCOUNT OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR THE NOTION OF WILL IS RATHER INCOHERENT AND CIRCULAR IN THAT IT RELIES ON CONCEPTS THAT ARE DRAWN FROM ITS CONCLUSION I ENCOURAGE THOSE INTERESTED IN THE TOPIC TO READ BEHAVIORIST JOURNALS THERE ARE DECADES AND DECADES OF RESEARCH ON THIS
IT WAS AN INTERESTING ARTICLE BUT I WAS A LITTLE LOST ON HOW YOU USED THE TERM PHENOMENOLOGY ARE YOU USING IT TO DENOTE WHAT BLOCK CALLS PHENOMENAL CONSCIOUSNESS OR ARE YOU USING IT TO REFER TO A PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH EITHER OF THE HEGELIAN OR HUSSERLIAN KIND
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE DOES AWARENESS NEED SOMETHING PHENOMENAL IN ORDER TO EXIST
WE SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT THEY ARE INDEPENDENT REALITIES EVEN IF THEY INTUITIVELY SEEM TO BE

THANKS FOR WRITING THE ARTICLE THIS LINE BEGS THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE LIMIT IF WE HAVE A HUMAN HOOKED UP TO A STATE OF THE ART EEG THE ONLY WAY WE COULD CORRECTLY PREDICT HIS SUBJECTIVE STATE IS IF WE HAD ALREADY MAPPED THE CORRELATIVE NEURAL NETWORKS THROUGH SELF REPORTS EVEN WHEN WE DEVELOP A COMPLETE LIVE BRAIN READOUT THE CRITERIA TERMINOLOGY IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL CONVEYS SUBJECTIVE CLAIMS IS STILL INCOMMENSURABLE WITH OBJECTIVE 3RD PERSON QUANTITATIVE CLAIMS ABOUT NEURONAL BEHAVIOR

SO WHILE THEY ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN AND CAN BE EVER MORE ACCURATELY CORRELATED THEY CERTAINLY USE INCOMMENSURABLE CRITERIA SYMBOLOGY IN EACH OF THEIR DOMAINS AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY WHEN YOU SAY EVEN IF THEY INTUITIVELY SEEM TO BE I'M CURIOUS IF YOU MEANT THIS EPISTEMOLOGICAL SEPARATION BETWEEN CRITERIA IS EASILY BRIDGEABLE I PERSONALLY DON'T SEE HOW PROPERTY DUALISM IS GOING TO EVER BE TRANSCENDED BUT I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK THANKS

FYI COMMENTING IS OPEN UNTIL FRIDAY SEPT
SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO RICHARD HOLTON MIT DISCUSSES THE CLASSIC PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM OF FREE WILL THAT IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE HUMAN BEINGS DECIDE THINGS FOR OURSELVES OR ARE FORCED TO GO ONE WAY OR ANOTHER HE DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT WORRIES ONE WORRY IS THAT THE LAWS OF PHYSICS PLUS FACTS ABOUT THE PAST OVER WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL DETERMINE WHAT WE WILL DO AND THAT MEANS WE'RE NOT FREE ANOTHER WORRY IS THAT BECAUSE THE LAWS AND THE PAST DETERMINE WHAT WE'LL DO SOMEONE SMART ENOUGH COULD KNOW WHAT WE WOULD DO AHEAD OF TIME SO WE CAN'T BE FREE HE SAYS THE SECOND WORRY IS MUCH WORSE THAN THE FIRST BUT ARGUES THAT THE SECOND DOESN'T FOLLOW FROM THE FIRST

THIS REMINDS ME OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES

DEATH THERE WAS A MERCHANT IN BAGDAD WHO SENT HIS SERVANT TO MARKET TO BUY PROVISIONS AND IN A LITTLE WHILE THE SERVANT CAME BACK WHITE AND TREMBLING AND SAID MASTER JUST NOW WHEN I WS IN THE MARKETPLACE I WAS JOSTLED BY A WOMAN IN THE CROWD AND WHEN I TURNED I SAW IT WAS DEATH THAT JOSTLED ME SHE LOOKED AT ME AND MADE A THREATENING CESURE NOW LEND ME YOUR HORSE AND I WILL RIDE AWAY FROM THIS CITY AND AVOID MY FATE I WILL GO TO SAMARRA AND THERE DEATH WILL NOT FIND ME THE MERCHANT LENT HIM HIS HORSE AND THE SERVANT MOUNTED IT AND HE DUG HIS SPURS IN ITS FLANKS AND AS FAST AS THE HORSE COULD GALLOP HE WENT THEN THE MERCHANT WENT DOWN TO THE MARKETPLACE AND HE SAW ME STANDING IN THE CROWD AND HE CAME TO ME AND SAID WHY DID YOU MAKE A THREATENING GESTURE TO MY SERVANT WHEN YOU SAW HIM THIS MORNING THAT WAS NOT A THREATENING GESTURE I SAID IT WAS ONLY A START OF SURPRISE I WAS ASTONISHED OT SEE HIM IN BAGDAD FOR I HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM TONIGHT IN SAMARRA THE APPOINTMENT IN SAMARRA AS RETOLD BY WEST SOMERSET MAUGHAM
BUT IF AS EINSTEIN INSISTED TIME IS MERELY AN ILLUSION THEN THERE IS NO PROBLEM FOREKNOWLEDGE ISN'T ANYTHING OTHER THAN KNOWLEDGE AND THERE IS NO TIMELINE TO INTERFERE WITH
I WAS KIND OF THINKING ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN LYING IN BED IF MY CONSCIOUSNESS TRAVELED BACK IN TIME AND INHABITED A YOUNGER ME RETAINING ALL OF MY CURRENT MEMORIES OF EVENTS YET TO HAPPEN I WOULD EFFECTIVELY KNOW MY OWN FUTURE BUT IT'S PRETTY POINTLESS BECAUSE IF I USE THAT KNOWLEDGE TO ALTER AN EVENT I'LL NO LONGER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT SO I EITHER HOLD ON TO KNOWLEDGE THAT I CANNOT USE OR GIVE IT UP BY USING IT ONCE TAKING A MAJOR GAMBLE
JUST ASK YOURSELF WHY AM I HERE IN THIS COMMENT SECTION DID IT JUST HAPPENED OF ITSELF OR WAS IT I WHO DID IT

IT'S VERY INTERESTING
UGH THIS VIDEO IS FRUSTRATING TO ME

I WOULD MAKE A FALSE PREDICTION NO REASON I NEED TO STAY INSIDE HIS STUPID THOUGHT BUBBLE TO PLAY THE GAME I PERSONALLY WOULD KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN IF ALL I COULD COMMUNICATE WAS THE WRONG ANSWER IN FACT THIS SITUATION ALLOWS ME TO KNOW THAT THE PREDICTION WILL BE FALSE SO I WILL KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS EVEN IF THE OBSERVER OF MY SIGNAL WON'T
THE TRUTH IS THAT SAYING THE UNIVERSE IS DETERMINISTIC IS AN ASSUMPTION ONLY MADE BY NATURALISTS IT IS FOOLISH TO ASSUME THAT WE CAN EXPLAIN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE ALONG WITH CONCIOUSNESS IN A DETERMINISTIC MANNER
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK BEFORE YOU THINK IS AS ELUSIVE AS PRE BIG BANG
WHY I FEEL ALL OF IT IS DEFEATED EXAMPLE

SOMEONE COULD LOOK AT MY HISTORY LOOK AT THE WEATHER MY SCHEDULE ETC ANDVSAY THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY STACK OF EYEBALLS WILL GO MOUNTAIN BIKING TODAY

OK EVEN THAT'S JUST A MAYBE BUT MAYBE A SAFE BET

BUT NO ONE NOT EVEN MYSELF COULD KNOW HOW THE ROCKS ON THE BIKE PATH WILL BE LAYING OR HOW I MAY REACT TO ANY NUMBER OF OBSTACLES OR EVEN IF I WILL NOT CRASH

AGAIN YOU COULD SAY I MIGHT NOT CRASH BUT THAT'S BUILT ON PRE KNOWLEDGE NOT FOREKNOWLEDGE

THERE IS NO WAY FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE ALL OF THE NESSICARY INFORMATION OF THE TRAIL CONDITION I'M RIDING ONLY MOMENTS BEFORE I RIDE IT ROCKS MOVE ALL THE TIME FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS EVEN RANDOMLY ROLLING IN FRONT OF YOU OR AN ANIMAL RUNS OUT IN THE PATH ETC

IN THIS SIMPLE EXAMPLE WE SEE HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TO HAVE TRUE FOREKNOWLEDGE OF A STREAM OF EVENT'S

YOU COULD GO DEEP LOOK AT ALL PAST CHOICES IN REGARDS TO MOUNTAIN BIKING AND PERHAPS COME UP WITH AN ACCURATE PREDICTION AS TO HOW THE RIDE WILL GO BUT EVEN THEN THAT IS IN ONLY ON A MACRO SCALE IE I'LL PROBABLY SURVIVE AND PROBABLY HAVE FUN
ALL THE PREINFORMATION CAN NOT PREDICT WITH CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE HOW EACH AND EVERY CORNER WILL BE TAKEN OR ANY UNEXPECTED ANYTHING

EVEN THEN THAT IS NOG FOREKNOWLEDGE THAT'S IS GENERATING A PREDICTION BASED ON EXISTING PAST EVENTS TO STATISTICALLY BASE A PREDICTION WHICH IS BY DEFINITION NOTHING BUT AN EDUCATED GUESS

AS SOMEONE ELSE MENTIONED TRUE FOREKNOWLEDGE WOULD REQUIRE TIME TRAVEL EVERYTHING ELSE IS DATA BASED PREDICTIONS
IF I CAN REPEAT THE PREDICTION EVERY DAY I'D FIGURE OUT PRETTY SOON THAT THE LIGHT BULB WOULD ALWAYS DO THE OPPOSITE
SO I WOULD IDENTIFY IT AS A FRUSTRATER AND THEN FRUSTRATE THE FRUSTRATER MYSELF
THIS DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE TO ME IN THE GIVEN EXAMPLE YOU DO IN FACT KNOW AT WHETHER THE LIGHT WILL BE ON OR OFF AT IT'S JUST THAT YOU CAN NOT SIGNAL THIS KNOWLEDGE IN THE WAY YOU ARE EXPECTED TO ASKING A QUESTION THEN TAKING AWAY ONE'S ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE THE ANSWER DOES NOT MEAN THEY DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER

THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER YOU CAN PREDICT THE STATE OF THEIR LIGHT AT IT WILL SIMPLY BE THE OPPOSITE OF THE STATE OF YOUR LIGHT AT AND YOU DO KNOW THE STATE OF YOUR LIGHT AT EITHER YOU HAVE FREE WILL AND YOU GET TO CHOOSE THE STATE OF YOUR LIGHT OR YOU DON'T HAVE FREE WILL BUT GIVEN THE STATE OF THE UNIVERSE AND INFINITE COMPUTING POWER YOU ARE ABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER YOU WILL TURN IT ON EITHER WAY WE'RE JUST BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION OF FREE WILL AND DETERMINISM I DON'T SEE HOW THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH THE ANSWER
THE ISSUE HERE IS NOT THAT I CANNOT KNOW WHAT THE LIGHT BULB IS GOING TO DO IN FACT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WHAT THE LIGHT BULB IS GOING TO DO THE ISSUE WITH THIS PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE GAGGED ME YOU HAVE PREVENTED ME FROM SPEAKING CLEARLY AND FULLY THE FULL ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM IS THAT I WILL TURN MY LIGHT BULB OFF AND YOUR LIGHT WILL BE ON DONE THE FACT THAT THE ANSWER IS LONGER THAN ONE WORD DOESN'T DIMINISH THE FACT THAT I KNOW THE ANSWER

EDIT ALTERNATIVELY IF I KNOW THE EXACT MECHANICS OF YOUR LIGHT SENSOR AND LIGHT SWITCH I COULD CREATE A STROBE LIGHT SUCH THAT IT WOULD ALWAYS BE ON WHEN YOUR LIGHT WAS ON AND OFF WHEN YOUR LIGHT WAS OFFICIAL THE INTERNAL SWITCH HAPPENS ONLY SO FAST IF I KNOW THE RATE AT WHICH THE SWITCH OCCURS I COULD PROGRAM THE STROBE LIGHT TO SWITCH WITH THAT SAME FREQUENCY
JUST SMASH THE DAMN LIGHT BULB
HERE IS MY ANSWER

R DEBATERELIGION COMMENTS
CONSIDER THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS THE FUTURE WOULD THAT NOT IMPLY FREE WILL ARE WE EVEN THE SAME PERSON FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT IF SOMEONE BECOMES SUICIDAL ARE THEY THE SAME PERSON WHO WAS EAGER TO CONTINUE LIVING I BELIEVE WE HAVE PARTIAL FREE WILL BUT ARE PRESENTLY RETARDED BY OUR BODY AND PHYSICS

THIS IS JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT I DON'T REALLY KNOW ANYTHING
I TURN ON MY LIGHTBULB KNOWING FULL WELL THE OTHER LIGHTBULB WILL BE OFFICIAL JUST BECAUSE I'M ONLY ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THE WRONG ANSWER TO YOU WITH MY LIGHTBULB DOESN'T MEAN I DIDN'T HAVE FOREKNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

SO IT'S NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT I LIKE THE IDEA OF A FRUSTRATER IT KIND OF MAKES ME THINK OF THE QUANTUM PROPERTY WHERE YOU CAN'T QUERY A SYSTEM WITHOUT MANIPULATING ITS STATE IT TOUCHES ON AN IMPORTANT PART OF FREE WILL THAT IS OFTEN DISMISSED WHICH IS THAT YOU CAN'T TOTALLY SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM THE WORLD AS AN OBSERVER YOUR BRAIN AND THE DECISIONS IT MAKES ARE PART OF THAT SYSTEM EVEN IF ALL THE DECISIONS YOU MAKE CAN BE DERIVED FROM SOME PAST STATE OF THE UNIVERSE IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THEY WERE YOUR DECISIONS
METAPHYSICS JUST MEANS NOT REAL PHYSICS FRUSTRATORY ARE SIMPLY NOTHING MORE THAN SIGNAL INVERTERS THE LIGHT BULB QUESTION IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE OLD I AM LYING SENTENCE IT SIMPLY TAKES WHATEVER THE CURRENT CONDITION IS AND WITCHES IT YOU'RE SIMPLY RIGGING THE GAME IN THAT CASE

IN REALITY YOU CAN SIMPLY SAY THAT THE CONDITION OF YOUR TEST BULB DOES NOT ACTUALLY REPRESENT YOUR ACTUAL PREDICTION I'LL TURN THE LIGHT ON AND SO THE LIGHT ON THE BOX WILL BE OFFICIAL THIS DOES NOTHING TO IMPACT FREE WILL EITHER WAY

I'M SORRY BUT THIS SEEMS A LOT LIKE PHILOSOPHERS CREATING ARTIFICIAL PROBLEMS TO PONDER
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT BUT SOMEONE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT THAT WILL BE
THEY SHOULD HAVE RICK AND MORTY NARRATE ONE OF THESE
ALWAYS A CHILDISH NOTION BUT OFTEN ENTERTAINING NONETHELESS A SMALL PART OF FREE WILL IS HAVING THE CHOICE TO BELIEVE IT DOES OR DOES NOT EXIST

FOR THOSE WHO RECOGNIZE HAVING EXERCISED THEIR WILL IT'S AS REAL AS SCIENCE THE IRONY IN THE FACE OF SUCH AN OBVIOUS FACT TO DENY FREE WILL AT ALL SHOWS A WILL OF ITS OWN

WILL IS IN ANY BEING THAT MAKES A CHOICE NO MATTER HOW EDUCATED OR IGNORANT OF THE MATTER BEING DECIDED THE CHOICE IS ALWAYS A CHOICE
ONE THING THAT OFTEN CONFUSES PEOPLE IS THAT THEY ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT A DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM IS FATED TO BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY EVEN IF YOU SHOWED IT IT'S FUTURE

THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND WE CAN ILLUSTRATE THAT VERY SIMPLY

SUPPOSE YOU HAVE A DETERMINISTIC GAME PLAYING MACHINE AN ORDINARY COMPUTER THAT IS ALSO A LEARNING MACHINE THAT CAN LEARN BY WATCHING VIDEOS OF PLAYED GAMES
FURTHER SUPPOSE THAT THE MACHINE JUST LOST A GAME THAT YOU VIDEOTEX
IF WE WENT BACK IN TIME BEFORE THE GAME AND SHOWED THAT MACHINE THE VIDEO OF THE GAME THAT IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE LOST THEN THAT DETERMINISTIC MACHINE WOULD THEN PLAY EVALUATE THE GAME DIFFERENTLY IN WHAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE COUNT AS THE SAME SITUATION AND MIGHT NOT LOSE
READ THIS AS IS FREE WIFI COMPATABLE WITH FOREKNOWLEDGE
THIS VIDEO IS EVIDENCE TO THE TRIVIALITY OF CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY OF FREE WILLIAM

ONE WOULD NEED YEARS OF HARD WORK TO LEARN MODERN PHYSICS OR MATHEMATICS AND YET PHILOSOPHY OF FREE WILL NEVER GETS MORE COMPLICATED THAN COMMON SENSE SIMPLE ARGUMENTS

PHILOSOPHERS MAY DECORATE THESE COMMON SENSE ARGUMENTS WITH ENDLESS AMOUNT OF WORDS AND BOOKS AND INTRICATE JARGON AND EVEN WORSE THEY WILL PROTECT THEIR TURF FEROCIOUSLY AGAINST ANY PHILOSOPHER WHO MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY DARE TO PUBLISH HIS OWN OPINION BUT THE FACT REMAINS

THE MOST EXCITING CONTRIBUTION IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF PHILOSOPHY ON THIS SUBJECT IS FRANKFURT TYPE EXAMPLES WHICH ONE CAN GRASP IN ONE READING

I SUPPOSE I MIGHT BE MISSING SOMETHING BUT BASED ON THE CRITERIA I WOULD BE ABLE OT PREDICT WHAT WAS IN THE BOX I WOULD EVEN HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREDICT I WAS GOING TO BE ASKED TO DO THE TEST AND KNOW HOW IT WORKED

DOESNT THAT MAKE IT ALL VERY EASY I CAN TURN THE LIGHT ON AND THEN TURN IT OFF AND THE LIGHT WILL BE ON AT NOON

AM I MISSING SOMETHING
BEING PROBABLY NERDS YOU PROBABLY ALL ARE AWARE OF THIS BUT THE DUNE SERIES HAS SOME GREAT EXPLORATIONS OF PRESCIENCE AND FREEWILL PLUS LASERS AND ALIENS ETC
THIS IS A GREAT ANALYSIS OF
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS OUR ENDING AND EVEN LARGE LIFE EVENTS MAY BE DETERMINED BUT THE PATH WE TAKE TO GET THERE CAN VARY BASED ON FREE WILLIAM
INTERESTING
BUT IF FRUSTRATER IS OF THE LIGHT BULBS IS RUN BY PREDICTABLE ENERGY DIFFERENCES OF THE SENSORS IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME BECAUSE I CAN PINPOINT EXACTLY WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE ENERGY TRANSFERENCES ARE TO GET THE LIGHT BULB PREDICTION CORRECTLY IF IT'S POSSIBLE

EG ONE LIGHT BULB MAY TURN OFF BEFORE IMPOSSIBLE PREDICTION THEN INVALID
THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T FIND OUT THE MEANING OF LIFE EXCEPT OF IF WE WOULD KNOW THE MEANING OF LIFE WE WOULD BE OUR OWN FRUSTRATORY
THESE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE DUMB

FIRST PROBLEM ASSUMES DETERMINISTIC YET WE HAVE QUANTUM STUFF WE CAN'T EXPLAIN


ALL OTHER PRESUPPOSITIONS ARE NOW INVALID

ALSO THE FRUSTRATER IS INVALID BECAUSE IT CHANGED THE MECHANISM TO JUST COPY YOUR PREDICTION A PREDICTION THAT CAN'T BE BASED ON ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THE HIDDEN MECHANISM STATES THAT IT GIVES YOU ALL KNOWLEDGE TO PREDICT BUT IGNORES THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MECHANISM IT PROVES FREE WILLIAM


ALSO TO PROVE THAT THE UNIVERSE ISN'T PURELY NATURAL EXPLAIN WHERE ABSTRACT IDEAS TAKE SPACE IT TAKES NO SPACE BECAUSE IT ISN'T PART OF SPACE OR TIME YET THEY ARE INFORMATION TO US
THE TACHYON MURDER
I THINK FATE OR DESTINY IS JUST AS REAL AS YOUR ABILITY TO SHAPE IT

FOR SOMEONE WHO WOULD KNOW IS DENNETT ATTACKING SOMETHING THAT EXISTS OR JUST SOME SPOOKY SPECTRE OF POSTMODERNISM
PLATO HOLDS GEOMETRY UP TO BE THE SHINING EXAMPLE OF TRUTH BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY FOR GEOMETRY TO BE DEFINED THE EUCLIDEAN WAY NOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTS THAT IN IMPORTANT SENSES ARE IRRECONCILABLE EACH GIVING A DIFFERENT CORRECT ANSWER DEPENDING ON THE AXIOMS ONE STARTS WITH

A SIMILAR THING HOLDS TRUE FOR SCIENCE MULTIPLE THEORIES CAN MAKE THE SAME PREDICTIONS WHILE YOU CAN GENERALLY TAKE RAZOR TO ONE OR THE OTHER AND SAY WE OUGHT TO ACCEPT THEORY A OVER THEORY B BECAUSE IT IS MORE PARSIMONIOUS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEORY A IS MORE LIKELY TO BE TRUE

DENNETT ACTS AS IF SCIENCE IS A PROJECT WHERE WE ARE CONSTANTLY AND CONSISTENTLY APPROACHING THE ASYMPTOTE OF TRUTH A NOTION THOROUGHLY DESTROYED BY KUHN DESPITE THIS HE GOES ON AS THOUGH THE PROGRESSIVE PARADIGMS ARE MORE TRUE RATHER THAN MORE USEFUL AND LESS FALSE
AGAIN AND AGAIN IN SCIENCE HERESIES HAVE BECOME NEW ORTHODOXIES NO RELIGION EXHIBITS THAT PATTERN IN ITS HISTORY

THIS IS A FALSE GENERALIZATION THOUGH BOTH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND TIBETAN MAHAYANA BUDDHISM AS TWO EXAMPLES ACCEPT THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION I DO AGREE THAT THEY LARGELY AVOID ADOPTING HERESIES
THIS IS A COMPLETE STRAWMANNING OF RORTY AND A CARICATURE OF POSTMODERNISM NO SURPRISE IT'S FROM DANIEL DENNETT
OPINION IS DIVIDED BUT YOU ENTIRELY MISUNDERSTAND THE POINT OF THESE DISAGREEMENTS IF YOU SUPPOSE THAT THEY UNDERCUT CLAIMS SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING

LIFE FIRST EMERGED ON THIS PLANET MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND MILLION YEARS AGO

THE HOLOCAUST HAPPENED DURING WORLD WAR II

JACK RUBY SHOT AND KILLED LEE HARVEY OSWALD AT AM DALLAS TIME NOVEMBER

THESE ARE TRUTHS ABOUT EVENTS THAT REALLY HAPPENED THEIR DENIALS ARE FALSEHOODS NO SANE PHILOSOPHER HAS EVER THOUGHT OTHERWISE THOUGH IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE THEY HAVE SOMETIMES MADE CLAIMS THAT COULD BE SO INTERPRETED

ACTUALLY A VERY SANE PHILOSOPHER BRUNO DE FIORETTI WOULD DENY THAT THESE ARE TRUTHS FOR DE FIORETTI THEY WOULD ONLY BE SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITIES
I ADMIRE HOW DENNETT PRESSES THE ISSUE OF REFLECTIVE SCIENCE AND TRUTH OF TRUTH NOT TRUTH OF TRUTH I AM WORRIED HOWEVER THAT HE DOES NOT LEAVE ROOM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT SCIENCE IS WITHOUT QUESTION OUR LEAST WEAK TOOL TO ARRIVE AT METAPHYSICAL TRUTHS NO MATTER HOW FINELY YOU SHARPEN THAT TOOL IT IS STILL LIMITED BY ITS USAGE UNLESS AND THIS IS A BIG UNLESS WE START TO ADMIT SCIENCE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD ALTHOUGH I FEAR THIS WILL BRING ABOUT BORING SEMANTIC REASON I BELIEVE IS SOMETHING WHICH CAN TRANSCEND SCIENCE AND TACKLE PERSPECTIVES SUCH AS POSTMODERNISM WHERE SCIENCE CANNOT DO SO WELL
PROFESSOR EHRENBERG WILL BE DOING AN AMA HERE ON R PHILOSOPHY MONDAY SEPTEMBER AT ET PLEASE SEE THIS POST WHERE YOU CAN SUBMIT QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME OR JOIN US MONDAY AT IN WELCOMING PROF EHRENBERG TO OUR COMMUNITY

ABSTRACT

I EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE PRESENCE OF ANARCHISTS AMONG KEY LEGAL OFFICIALS UPON THE LEGAL POSITIVIST THEORIES OF H LINE A HART AND JOSEPH RAZ FOR PURPOSES OF THIS PAPER AN ANARCHIST IS ONE WHO BELIEVES THAT THE LAW CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY OBLIGATE OR CREATE REASONS FOR ACTION BEYOND PRUDENTIAL REASONS SUCH AS AVOIDING SANCTION I SHOW THAT BOTH VERSIONS OF POSITIVISM REQUIRE KEY LEGAL OFFICIALS TO ENDORSE THE LAW IN SOME WAY AND THAT IF A LEGAL SYSTEM CAN CONTINUE TO EXIST AND FUNCTION WHEN ITS KEY OFFICIALS REJECT THE CHARACTER OF LAW THEN WE HAVE A REASON TO RE-EXAMINE AND AMEND LEGAL POSITIVISM

WELL I AM CERTAINLY MADE UNCOMFORTABLE BY THIS TITLE I DON'T WANT TO READ IT AT ALL AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I SHOULD
I'M CURIOUS IF ANYONE ACTUALLY PRACTICES TRUE HUMANE OMNIVORISM AS THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES IT HERE

I'VE MET PLENTY OF VEGANS AND VEGETARIANS INCLUDING MYSELF FULL DISCLOSURE AND I'VE MET PEOPLE WHO WILL OFTEN TRY TO EAT HUMANE MEAT BUT I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE WHO IS EXCLUSIVELY A HUMANE OMNIVORE IT SEEMS MUCH MORE IMPRACTICAL IN PRACTICE THAN SIMPLY ABSTAINING FROM MEAT OR ALL ANIMAL PRODUCTS

IF THERE IS ANYONE HERE WHO DOES THIS I HAVE A FEW PRACTICAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU

DO YOU ALWAYS REFUSE ALL MEAT UNLESS YOU CAN BE SURE IT WAS SLAUGHTERED HUMANELY
DO YOU REFUSE OTHER ANIMAL PRODUCTS THAT REQUIRE THE DEATH OF AN ANIMAL UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT ANIMAL WAS RAISED HUMANELY I'M TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE GELATIN ISINGLASS BONE SUGAR MEAT BROTHS FISH PASTE CAESAR SALAD DRESSING BACON FLAVORED CHIPS ETC
IS THERE A RELIABLE WAY TO TELL IF IT WAS SUCH AS A LABEL I'M NOT AWARE OF A GOOD LABEL THAT MEANS THAT AN ANIMAL WAS RAISED AND SLAUGHTERED WITHOUT SUFFERING
DO YOU TELL PEOPLE WHO INVITE YOU OVER TO DINNER THAT YOU ONLY EAT HUMANE MEAT HOW DOES THAT WORK
WHEN INVITED TO A WEDDING DO YOU SELECT THE VEGETARIAN MEAL UNLESS YOU HAVE ASSURANCES THE STEAK WAS RAISED HUMANELY
DO YOU ONLY CHOOSE VEGETARIAN MEALS ON INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS
ARE YOU BASICALLY VEGETARIAN OR VEGAN WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS
INTERESTING ARTICLE

IF MORALITY ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THE GENERAL POPULATION CARES ABOUT THEN IT STILL MAKES SENSE TO CONSIDER SUFFERING FROM A HEALTH POINT OF VIEW SUFFERING AND POORLY TREATED FED ANIMALS LEADS TO POORER NUTRITION UNFAVOURABLE RATIOS OF OMEGA MORE NEED FOR ANTIBIOTICS ETC

IT'S ALSO INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE CONSIDER THE LIVES THAT THESE ANIMALS COULD HAVE HAD IF WE DIDN'T KILL THEM JUST A THOUGHT THESE ANIMALS ARE BEING REARED AND RAISED TO THEN BE KILLED FOR CONSUMPTION ONLY IF WE DIDN'T DEMAND MEAT FOR CONSUMPTION THESE ANIMALS WOULD NOT EXIST IN THE NUMBERS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND SO WE ALREADY ONLY VALUE THEIR LIVES FOR WHAT THEY CAN PROVIDE US

EDIT IF MORALITY IS TO IF MORALITY ISN'T
ARTICLES LIKE THE ONE POSTED ALWAYS GIVE WEIGHT TO THE LOSS OF PLEASURE INTRINSIC IN HAVING FEWER FOOD CHOICES BUT THEY NEVER SEEM TO GIVE WEIGHT TO THE PLEASURE DERIVED FROM KNOWING THAT I'M NOT PARTICIPATING IN SOMETHING MY ETHICAL REASONING TELLS ME IS EVIL

AS KAFKA SAID WHILE GAZING AT AN ANIMAL NOW I CAN LOOK AT YOU IN PEACE I DON'T EAT YOU ANY MORE
WOULD YOU RATHER A BE BORN ALREADY WITH AN EXECUTION DATE AND LIFE YOUR LIFE IN MISERY CONFINEMENT ANXIETY TRAUMA AND ULTIMATELY BE KILLED TO BECOME A FEW PEOPLES DINNER OR B NOT HAVE BEEN BORN AT ALL
IT SEEMS PRETTY OBVIOUS TO ME MATE
I ACCIDENTALLY POSTED THIS IN R VEGAN BEFORE REALISING I WAS IN THE WRONG SUBREDDIT

THAT WAS A REALLY FASCINATING READ THANKS FOR BRINGING IT TO MY ATTENTION

I REALLY LIKED THIS BIT

MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE ARGUED THAT DEATH IS A MISFORTUNE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE AMOUNT OF GOOD LIFE IT PREVENTS THE INDIVIDUAL FROM HAVING BUT THIS IMPLIES THAT THE WORST DEATH THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN SUFFER IS IMMEDIATELY AFTER BEGINNING TO EXIST ON ANY PLAUSIBLE VIEW ABOUT WHEN WE BEGIN TO EXIST IT IS INTUITIVELY IMPLAUSIBLE THAT DEATH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT IS A GREATER MISFORTUNE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE TIME THAN SAY THE DEATH OF A PERSON AT AGE TWENTY

HAVING DEMONSTRATED SO CLEARLY IN MY VIEW THAT MEASURING THE AMOUNT OF GOOD LIFE PREVENTED BY A DEATH DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK IN DETERMINING THE WRONGNESS OF DEATH I'M REALLY CONFUSED WHY HE THEN HOLDS ON TO THIS METRIC AT ALL AND INCLUDES IT AS ONE OF HIS TWO INDEPENDENT FACTORS

I HAVE ARGUED ELSEWHERE THAT THE EXTENT TO WHICH DEATH IS A MISFORTUNE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IS A FUNCTION PRIMARILY OF TWO INDEPENDENT FACTORS THE AMOUNT OF GOOD LIFE OF WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS DEPRIVED BY DEATH AND 2 THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE TIME OF DEATH WOULD HAVE BEEN PSYCHOLOGICALLY CONNECTED TO HIMSELF AT THOSE TIMES IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE GOOD THINGS IN HIS LIFE WOULD HAVE OCCURRED

WHY BOTHER KEEPING THE TIME FACTOR AT ALL WHEN YOU THEN NEED TO DISCOUNT IT ACCORDING TO THE VALUE PLACED ON THE FUTURE EXISTENCE I'D ARGUE THAT THE ONLY THING RELEVANT TO KILLING A BEING IS THE VALUE THAT BEING PLACES ON ITS CONTINUED EXISTENCE PLUS KEEPING THE TIME FACTOR MEANS YOU THEN NEED TO INTRODUCE THE ASYMMETRY TO EXPLAIN WHY KILLING IS WORSE THAN FAILING TO BRING INTO EXISTENCE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT JOHN HARRIS VIEW ON THE WRONGNESS OF DEATH IS FAR SIMPLER AND MAKES MORE SENSE

I SUGGEST THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WRONG WITH DYING AND THAT IS DOING IT WHEN YOU DON T WANT TO

I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO READ BOOK TO FIND OUT HIS REASONING
I BELIEVE HIS MAJOR ERROR IS HUMANE REARING INVOLVES DEPRIVING ANIMALS OF MOST OF THE LIFE THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE

BECAUSE HUMANS REAR THEM FOR FOOD DOMESTICATED ANIMALS CONSTITUTE THE VAST MAJORITY OF OF LAND VERTEBRATES THE LIFE THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE WOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM IF THEY DIDN'T EXIST FOR THE PURPOSE OF FEEDING HUMANS

IN ADDITION ANIMALS IN NATURE RARELY DIE HUMANE DEATHS THEY USUALLY FALL PREY AT EARLY AGES TO STARVATION DISEASE AND DECIDEDLY PREDATION THEIR LIVES ARE NASTY BRUTISH AND SHORT MOSTLY LIVED IN CONSTANT TERROR OF PREDATORS THE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE IS NO MERE TROPE

I SUBMIT THAT A SHORT HAPPY LIFE IS SUPERIOR TO NO LIFE AT ALL


GREAT ARTICLE AS SOMEONE WHO HUMANELY RAISES RABBITS FOR MEAT BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS OF EATING FACTORY FARMED MEAT I APPRECIATE YOUR CROSS EXAMINATION MORE OR LESS OF THE SUBJECT
THIS ARTICLE ONLY PRODUCED A MEMORY OF MY FATHER AND MOTHER'S SIMPLE LIFE OF GARDENING DOMESTICATED ANIMAL RAISING FOR FOOD AND TRADE I RECALL COMING HOME ON LEAVE AND SHOOTING A FAT BUCK TO ADD TO THEIR FALL LARDER THEY WERE VERY HAPPY

I CUT UP A DOWNED TREE FOR FIRE WOOD AND STACKED IT NEAR THE HOUSE

MORALITY OF ANIMAL LIVES I CAN'T WORK THAT INTO WHAT THEY EXPERIENCED THEY WERE THANKFUL FOR THEIR LIVES AND FOR THE LIVES OF THE ANIMALS THAT SUPPORTED THEM NOTHING TAKEN IN VAIN
AS FAR AS GENERAL MUSING GO THIS IS FINE BUT A FEW IMMEDIATELY COME TO MIND

IS TIME ALIVE A GOOD METRIC OR ARE NOVEL EXPERIENCES A GOOD METRIC

IF SO WHAT NOVEL EXPERIENCE WILL A COW HAVE OVER YEARS IT THAT IT WON'T IN THE FIRST PERHAPS FARMING LIFE WOULD BE INHUMANELY BORING FOR THAT LONG OF A PERIOD

YEAR OLD BEEF OR YEAR OLD CHICKENS OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT BEING REFERRED TO AS A NATURAL LIFESPAN IS A BIT RIDICULOUS CONSIDERING THAT INJURY DISEASE AND PREDATION WILL PUT AVERAGE LONGEVITY MUCH LOWER LIVING A FULL NATURAL LIFE IS COMPLETELY UNNATURAL
HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY FOR SUSTAINING LIFE THAT NO ANIMAL HAS TO BE SLAUGHTERED HUMANELY OR OTHER WISE THERE IS NO JUST WAY TO KILL A LIVING CREATURE TO ENJOY A FEW MEALS GO VEGAN BUT SERIOUSLY WHY AREN'T YOU IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE ASPECTS OF HUMAN HISTORY THAT LIVING CREATURES COULD BE CONSIDERED PART OF AGRICULTURE THE FACT THAT EVERY ASPECT OF ANIMAL AGRICULTURE EXPRESSES A FAILING UNSUSTAINABLE FOOD SOURCE HAS BECOME SELF-EVIDENT IN THE AGE OF INFORMATION DON'T LET THIS BECOME THE AGE OF MISINFORMATION BY IGNORING THE FACTS ABOUT THE REALITY WE ALL SHARE ANIMAL AGRICULTURE CONTRIBUTES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS HEART LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN COUNTRIES CONSUMING PRIMARILY ANIMALS THE ENVIRONMENT ONE THE THE LEADING CAUSES OF GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE FORM OF METHANE CARBON DIOXIDE AND NITROUS OXIDE UNSUSTAINABLE FOOD SOURCE FOR INCREASED POPULATIONS WE GROW CROPS TO FEED ANIMALS TO FEED HUMANS SMALLER AMOUNTS OF FOOD THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE PRODUCED AND CONSUMED IF WE JUST FED HUMANS THE RIGHT PLANTS TO BEGIN WITH NOT TO MENTION THOSE WHO CLAIM CONNECTION TO THE INFINITE BEAUTY OF THE UNIVERSE VIA SPIRITUALITY RELIGION OR OTHERWISE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSUMING CONSCIOUS BEINGS IS NOT ONLY FALLACIOUS BUT DELUSIONAL AND MISGUIDED GET CHA MINDS RIGHT ANYONE WHO WISHES TO DISCUSS TRANSITIONING TO PLANT BASED LIFESTYLE THE REALITY BEHIND IT OR THOSE WHO POSSES THE TENACIOUS PRETENSIONS IN DEFIANCE OF TRUTH JUSTICE AND WHOLESOMENESS GET AT ME

I HAVE REASONED THAT KILLING ANIMALS IS ONLY PERMISSIBLE ETHICAL FOR THREE REASONS SUSTENANCE SAFETY SECURITY WE EAT ANIMALS BECAUSE THEY ARE A VITAL SOURCE OF HIGH QUALITY PROTEIN I AGREE WITH MANUSCRIPT GRANDIN THAT WE OWE THEM A HUMANE EXISTENCE AND A PEACEFUL DEATH SAFETY IF I AM ATTACKED BY AN ANIMAL I HAVE A RIGHT TO PROTECT MYSELF AND FIGHT BACK SECURITY I HAVE A RIGHT TO PROACTIVELY PROTECT MY LIVING AREA THAT BEING SAID WE MUST RESPECT WILDLIFE AND PROTECT THEIR HABITAT AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT IT WOULD BE A GREAT IDEA TO CUT HUMAN POPULATION BY ATTRITION BY
I WOULD PROBABLY CLASSIFY MYSELF AS A HUMANE OMNIVORE BUT NOT HIS ONE HE GOES AHEAD AND SAYS THAT A HUMANE OMNIVORE GIVES ANIMAL SUFFERING SOME LESSER PROPORTION OF HUMAN SUFFERING I DON'T SEE WHERE HE MAKES THAT LEAP FROM ANIMAL SUFFERING IS NOT JUST THE KILL BUT ALSO IT'S LIFE TO THAT POINT AND ID BE SURPRISED IF ANY HOS DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A REASONABLY GOOD LIFE FOR THE ANIMAL I AGREE THAT THE DENIAL OF A FULL LIFE HAS SOME MORAL COST
ON ANY PLAUSIBLE VIEW ABOUT WHEN WE BEGIN TO EXIST IT IS INTUITIVELY IMPLAUSIBLE THAT DEATH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT IS A GREATER MISFORTUNE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AT THE TIME THAN SAY THE DEATH OF A PERSON AT AGE TWENTY

I DO NOT FIND THAT IMPLAUSIBLE AT ALL IF YOU TOLD ME THAT I WAS GOING TO DIE IN SECONDS I'D VERY MUCH PREFER THAT TO HAVING NEVER EXISTED AT ALL

YET MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IF A SPERM AND EGG WERE ABOUT TO FUSE IN CONCEPTION BUT WERE DESTROYED JUST PRIOR TO FUSING THERE WOULD BE NO SIGNIFICANT LOSS AT ALL BUT IF THAT IS RIGHT IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IF THE ZYGOTE WERE TO DIE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SPERM AND EGG HAVE FUSED WITHOUT EXPERIENCING EVEN A FLICKER OF CONSCIOUSNESS IT WOULD BE THE VICTIM OF A TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE

THIS ARGUMENT IS FATALLY FLAWED BECAUSE IT EQUIVOCATES BETWEEN AN OBJECTIVE OR OVERALL LOSS AND AN INDIVIDUAL LOSS THE SPERM AND EGG FAILING TO FUSE IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF FUTURE HAPPINESS BECAUSE IF THE WOULD-BE PARENTS WERE TRYING TO CONCEIVE AND FAILED THEY VERY LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TRYING TO CONCEIVE AN INDIVIDUAL WILL STILL BE BORN JUST A DIFFERENT ONE THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE BEFORE TOTAL HAPPINESS IS BASICALLY UNCHANGED IT'S NOT A LOSS IN AN OBJECTIVE OR TOTAL HAPPINESS SENSE AND IT CANNOT BE A LOSS IN AN INDIVIDUAL SENSE BECAUSE THERE IS NO INDIVIDUAL THAT EXPERIENCED A LOSS THE LOSS OF THE ZYGOTE IS EQUIVALENT FROM A TOTAL HAPPINESS PERSPECTIVE BUT FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION IS WORSE THAN DYING AT AGE ASSUMING LIFE UP TO AGE IS PRETTY GOOD

THE FALSE EQUIVOCATION SETS UP THE INTUITION WHICH THE AUTHOR THEN USES TO JUSTIFY THE NEED FOR THE MUCH MORE COMPLEX PSYCHOLOGICAL CONNECTEDNESS OR ARIA STANDARD WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE OBVIOUS PROBLEMS FOR EXAMPLE IT JUSTIFIES KILLING SOMEBODY UNDERGOING A MOMENTARY PSYCHOTIC BREAK WHICH LASTS SECOND IS VERY UNPLEASANT WHILE IT OCCURS BUT HAS NO EFFECT ON THE REMAINING YEARS OF SOMEONE'S LIFE VERY OBJECTIONABLE IMPLICATION IT'S ALSO JUST AN UNNECESSARY COMPLICATION IF THE ONE PROBLEMATIC INTUITION I DEALT WITH ABOVE IF DISREGARDED
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE ARTICLES DEBATES HORSES PIGS CATTLE I WONDER WHAT PHILOSOPHICAL VEGANS THINK ABOUT EATING INSECTS
I'M NOT CONVINCED THIS PAPER SEEMS TO HINGE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ANIMALS CAN PERCEIVE TIME AS HUMANS DO SO FAR AS I CAN TELL THERE IS NO BASIS FOR THIS WHATSOEVER

NOT THAT I DISAGREE BUT UNSOUND LOGIC IS STILL UNSOUND
I WANT TO INJECT ANOTHER ELEMENT TO THIS WHAT IF WE TAKE IT THAT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE SWAYED BY THIS KIND OF ARGUMENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO EAT MEAT AND MANY MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO WITHOUT REFLECTING ON HOW IT WAS REARED OR WHERE IT CAME FROM THESE ARE THE CONSUMERS THAT COMPANIES WHO SELL MEAT ARE TARGETING AND IT'S THEIR PREFERENCES AND DEMANDS THAT THESE COMPANIES NEED TO MEET TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND MAKE THEIR PROFITS IF THEY DEMAND MEAT THAT IS RAISED HUMANELY AND WITHHOLD THEIR MONEY FROM COMPANIES WHO DON'T THEN COMPANIES ARE FORCED TO RESPOND TO THAT DEMAND FOR MORE ETHICAL MEAT

WHICH MEANS NOT EATING MEAT REMOVES YOU FROM THIS POOL AND DIMINISHES YOUR CAPACITY TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT YOU STOP BEING ON THEIR RADAR IN TERMS OF THEIR WILLINGNESS TO RESPOND TO YOUR DEMANDS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THE EXISTING CONSUMER BASE WILL BE FORCED TO PAY MORE FOR MEAT OR COMPANIES MAY BE FORCED TO ADOPT EVEN LESS ETHICAL PRACTICES IN ORDER TO RETAIN PROFITS WITH A SMALLER CONSUMER BASE

REMAINING A MEAT EATER ON THE OTHER HAND BUT ONE WHO DEMANDS MORE ETHICAL TREATMENT OF THE MEAT THEY EAT AND GIVES THEIR MONEY TO THOSE COMPANIES WHO DO PROVIDE MORE ETHICAL MEAT INCREASES THE ABILITY OF ETHICAL MEAT PRODUCERS TO MAKE A PROFIT AND ENCOURAGES THEM TO RESPOND TO THE DEMANDS OF A CONSUMER BASE THAT DEMANDS HIGHER STANDARDS IN THE INDUSTRY THIS OPPOSED TO REMOVING YOURSELF FROM HAVING AN INFLUENCE REMOVING ONE MORE ETHICAL MEAT EATER FROM THE POOL OF MEAT EATERS WHICH MAY FORCE COMPANIES TO ADOPT LOWER STANDARDS

THAT MEANS EATING MEAT BUT ETHICAL MEAT MAY DO THE MOST GOOD YOU CAN AND NOT EATING MEAT ALTOGETHER MAY ACTUALLY BE CAUSING MORE HARM
DEFENSE OF MEAT-EATING PRESUMING HUMANE TREATMENT OF THE ANIMALS AS THE ARTICLE DOES

COW LIVING YEARS GENERATES THE SAME UTILITY AS COWS EACH LIVING YEAR
2 COWS LIVING YEAR EACH GENERATES MORE MEAT THAN COW LIVING YEARS
HIGHER MEAT GENERATION LEADS TO HIGHER UTILITY AMONG HUMANS THAN LOWER MEAT GENERATION
THEREFORE SLAUGHTERING COWS ON THEIR 1ST BIRTHDAY HAS HIGHER UTILITY THAN SLAUGHTERING COWS ON THEIR BIRTHDAY

THE POTENTIALLY CONTROVERSIAL ARGUMENT HERE IS 2 AND FOLLOW FROM

IN DEFENSE OF ARGUMENT CONSIDER COWS IS THERE A MORAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN RANDOMLY PICKING COW TO LIVE EVERY YEAR FOR YEARS VS CONSISTENTLY PICKING THE SAME COW TO LIVE EVERY YEAR I DON'T SEE A DISTINCTION
I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE A LOT OF THE ARTICLE IS JUST IDIOTIC NITPICKING

OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE FOCUS MORE ON THE SUFFERING PART THAN ON PREVENTING THE ANIMAL FROM ENJOYING YEARS OF LIFE IT'S THE ABSOLUTE LOGICAL FIRST STEP ON THE PATH TO A HYPOTHETICAL UTOPIA WHERE EVERY CREATURE LIVES A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE

BUT IN A WORLD WHERE NOT EVEN ALL HUMANS ARE LIVING LONG FULFILLING LIVES WE CAN'T FOCUS ON ANIMALS JUST YET PRACTICALLY SPEAKING THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO CONVINCE STOP BILLION PEOPLE FROM EATING MEAT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO EVEN CONVINCE THEM TO SWITCH TO LAB GROWN MEAT THE WORST PART IS IT'S ABSOLUTELY ECONOMICALLY UNVIABLE FOR ANYONE TO EVEN GIVE HALF A SHIT BUT WE'LL GET THERE EVENTUALLY

UNTIL THEN THE BEST WE CAN DO IS STOP THE SUFFERING
I'M NOT A PHILOSOPHER BUT THE FLAW I FOUND IN THIS PAPER IS THE AUTHOR CONTINUOUSLY CONFLATES KILLING FOR PLEASURE AND KILLING FOR SUSTENANCE LIVESTOCK OF THE KIND DESCRIBED IN THE ARTICLE AREN'T RAISED TO BE SLAUGHTERED FOR PLEASURE RATHER THEY ARE RAISED TO BE SLAUGHTERED TO PRODUCE SUSTENANCE TO KEEP PEOPLE ALIVE AND HEALTHY HIS ARGUMENT COULD BE USED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT RAISING ANIMALS TO THEN BE USED FOR HUNTS IS IMMORAL BUT I DON'T THINK HE MAKES A GOOD CASE AGAINST LIVESTOCK FOR FOOD

QUITE A FAMOUS PIECE
I RATHER ADORE FREEMAN DYSON HE'S ONE OF THE FEW LIVING SCIENTISTS WHO I FEEL LIKE REALLY GRASPS THE CREATIVE SPIRIT AS WELL AS THE REASONING ONE INSOFAR AS THE TWO NEED BE DIFFERENTIATED HE SEEMS OF A DYING BREED BUT I HOPE MORE SCIENTISTS LOOK TO HIM AS A MODEL IN THE FUTURE I CERTAINLY DO

I SHOULD NOTE THAT FREEMAN IS VERY OLD HE WRITES RATHER MERRILY AT THIS POINT IN HIS LIFE WHICH I RATHER LIKE BUT THAT DOES MEAN HE OFFERS GLIB QUOTATIONS THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS IS NOT REALLY THE PLACE FOR EXTENDED PHILOSOPHIZING THIS BOOK REVIEW IS REALLY MORE OF ENTERTAINING REVUE FOR FREEMAN TO WAX NOSTALGIC ON A LIFE WITH THAT IN MIND HERE ARE SOME COMMENTS FROM A SCIENTIST

ANECDOTES ON WITTGENSTEIN ARE REALLY QUITE DELIGHTFUL THIS REALLY EXPOSES I THINK HIS RELATIVE TALENTS AS A WRITER OF SOME LITERARY METTLE I WOULD RECOMMEND HIS THE SCIENTIST AS REBEL TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS HIS STYLE EDIT HERE IS A VERSION OF TRACTATES WHICH FREEMAN TALKS ABOUT FOR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ENJOY THEORETICAL SCIENCE LIKE FREEMAN WHO HAVEN'T READ IT I HEARTILY RECOMMEND IT

I VERY MUCH LIKE DOWN-TO-EARTH MATTER-OF-FACT DEFINITION OF SCIENCE SCIENCE IS ABOUT FACTS THAT CAN BE TESTED AND MYSTERIES THAT CAN BE EXPLORED HOWEVER AS SOMEONE WHO HAS READ A FAIR SHARE OF PHILOSOPHY AND HISTORY OF SCIENCE I KNOW IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THIS AS PAUL FEYERABEND SAID IT CAN SOMETIMES SEEM THAT ANYTHING GOES AND I TEND MORE TOWARD FUNGIBLE DEFINITIONS I THINK DEFINITION IS RELATED TO SOME OF HIS MORE QUESTIONABLE CONCLUSIONS LIKE HIS PERSISTENT QUESTIONING OF GLOBAL WARMING WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK OF HIS DEFINITION

FREEMAN STRAYS AWAY FROM CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY OF COURSE HE DOES HE KNOWS LITTLE ABOUT IT DON'T BEGRUDGE HIM THAT

THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE ANACHRONISM IN COMPARING MODERN PHILOSOPHY TO ARISTOTLE OR CONFUCIUS THESE WERE DAYS WHEN SPECIALIZATION WAS DAMAGING AND MOREOVER WHEN A MYSTIC OR TEACHER SUCH AS PYTHAGORAS COULD SERIOUSLY AFFECT STATE POWER SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT POWER WAS RELATIVELY WEAK SEE JOHN EARLY GREEK PHILOSOPHY PG SCIENTISTS MIGHT REALLY ENJOY THIS BOOK BERTRAND RUSSELL QUOTES FROM IT COPIOUSLY IN THE EARLY SECTIONS OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY BUT WORK IS MUCH MORE SCHOLARLY BETTER WRITTEN AND HAS AGED RATHER WELL A FUN READ WHICH CAN BE FOUND HERE OR HERE WHICHEVER VERSION LOOKS BETTER TO YOU AND I FEEL THERE'S SIMPLY A CATEGORY ERROR IN COMPARING MUCH OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY WHICH HAS TAKEN A LINGUISTIC TURN TO POLITICAL PHILOSOPHERS LIKE MONTESQUIEU IT IS WORTH NOTING IN THIS REGARD THAT JOHN RAWLS HAS EXERTED A LARGE INFLUENCE ON THE MORAL HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WHO GREATLY LOOK UP TO MARTHA NUSSBAUM

HOW DID IT PHILOSOPHY BECOME A TOOTHLESS RELIC OF PAST GLORIES IS A VERY LOW BLOW FROM DYSON I THINK HIS ANSWER PHILOSOPHERS BECAME INSIGNIFICANT WHEN PHILOSOPHY BECAME A SEPARATE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE CONFUSES THE QUESTION IF PHILOSOPHY WERE NOT A SEPARATE DISCIPLINE ONE COULD NOT BE A PHILOSOPHER

I SUSPECT WHAT HE'S ON ABOUT IS THAT PHILOSOPHY HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO SO MANY FIELDS THAT HAVE NOW USURPED THE AREAS IT USED TO PRESIDE OVER WHICH WAS MORE OR LESS EVERYTHING HE SPEAKS IN TERMS OF PROFESSION BECAUSE HE IS SO DOWN TO EARTH BUT IDEOLOGICALLY I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IF MORE SCIENTISTS WRITERS AND PREACHERS INTERACTED WITH THESE PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR FIELD AS FREEMAN TRIES TO IN REGARDS TO SCIENTISTS FOLKS LIKE TIM MAUDLIN HAVE USED THE PHRASE EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY A LABEL I THINK COULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOYED MY COMMENTS
I LIKE HOW HE ACKNOWLEDGES HEIDEGGER AS ONE OF THE TWO MOST INFLUENTIAL TWENTIETH CENTURY PHILOSOPHERS BUT THEN THE REST OF HIS CHARACTERIZATION OF PHILOSOPHY PRECEDES AS IF THE CONTINENTAL TRADITION DOESN'T EXIST I ALSO LIKE THAT ONE OF HIS EXAMPLES OF GREAT LITERARY PHILOSOPHICAL MASTERPIECES OF THE PAST IS THE BOOK OF JOB

ALSO

HEIDEGGER WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF EXISTENTIALISM A SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY THAT WAS ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE TO FRENCH INTELLECTUALS

HEIDEGGER HIMSELF LOST HIS CREDIBILITY IN

EVERYTHING WITTGENSTEIN WROTE WAS SIMPLE AND CLEAR

I GUESS NONE OF THOSE STATEMENTS ARE UNARGUABLY FALSE BUT I'D EXPECT SOMEONE SETTING OUT TO MAKE GENERAL PRONOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PHILOSOPHY MIGHT EXERCISE A LITTLE MORE NUANCE IN DISCUSSING ITS HISTORY

READ THE STARSHIP AND THE CANOE SOMETIME
BOOK ON HE BIG EXISTENCE QUESTION IS AN AWESOME READ
REMOVED
FREEMAN GLOBAL WARMING DENIAL DISCREDITS HIM IN MY VIEW HE HAS GIVEN COMFORT TO A SECTOR OF THE PUBLIC THAT IS WORSE THAN THE BECAUSE OF THIS I HAVE NO TIME FOR ANYTHING HE MIGHT SAY
I READ THAT AS SPLINTERS AND LUMBER
INTRO

BIOSEMANTICS WAS THE TITLE OF A PAPER ON MENTAL REPRESENTATION ORIGINALLY
PRINTED IN THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY IN IT CONTAINED A MUCH ABBREVIATED
VERSION OF THE WORK ON MENTAL REPRESENTATION IN LANGUAGE THOUGHT AND OTHER
BIOLOGICAL CATEGORIES THERE I HAD PRESENTED A NATURALIST THEORY OF
INTENTIONAL SIGNS GENERALLY INCLUDING LINGUISTIC REPRESENTATIONS GRAPHS CHARTS
AND DIAGRAMS ROAD SIGN SYMBOLS ANIMAL COMMUNICATIONS THE CHEMICAL SIGNALS
THAT REGULATE THE FUNCTION OF GLANDS AND SO FORTH BUT THE TERM BIOSEMANTICS
HAS USUALLY BEEN APPLIED ONLY TO THE THEORY OF MENTAL REPRESENTATION LET ME FIRST
CHARACTERIZE A MORE GENERAL CLASS OF THEORIES CALLED TELEOLOGICAL THEORIES OF
MENTAL CONTENT OF WHICH BIOSEMANTICS IS AN EXAMPLE THEN I WILL DISCUSS THE
DETAILS THAT DISTINGUISH BIOSEMANTICS FROM OTHER NATURALISTIC TELEOLOGICAL THEORIES

AUTHOR

RUTH G MILLIKAN EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT
THE AUTHOR REPEATEDLY CLAIMS THAT BIOSEMANTICS IS SITUATED WITHIN THE TRADITION OF TELEOLOGICAL THEORIES BUT THIS PAPER MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO ACTUALLY DRAW FROM OR ENGAGE WITH THAT TRADITION OR TOUCH UPON THE TOPIC IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO CONTRAST BIOSEMANTICS WITH BIOCENTRIC THEORIES OF INTENTIONALITY SUCH AS THAT OUTLINED BY PLATO IN HIS CRATYLUS AND BY ARISTOTLE IN DE ANIMA AND ON MEMORY AND RECOLLECTION AT THE VERY LEAST DOING SO MIGHT HELP TO HISTORICALLY SITUATE BIOSEMANTICS WITHIN THE MINDS OF THE READERS AND NOT JUST IN THE MIND OF THE AUTHOR

EDIT IF I AM BEING UNFAIR AND THE AUTHOR HAS DONE THIS ELSEWHERE PLEASE LET ME KNOW
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS I'M NOT TRANS SO HERE ARE GENUINE QUESTIONS BUT THIS FRAMEWORK DOESN'T MESH WITH WHAT I UNDERSTAND ABOUT TRANSSEXUALITY

IF A PENIS IS NOT AN INHERENTLY MALE BODY PART WOULDN'T THAT IMPLY THAT ALL GRS IS PURELY COSMETIC

THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT GENDER DYSPHORIA IS A REAL AND SERIOUS THING HOWEVER IF A DOCTOR CAN GENUINELY SAY TO A TRANS WOMAN NO YOU ALREADY HAVE A FEMALE BODY THAT SEEMS TO REMOVE ALL MOTIVATION FOR INVASIVE SURGERY IS GENDER DYSPHORIA STRICTLY DUE TO HOW OTHERS PERCEIVE AND TREAT THE TRANS PERSON IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S SOMETHING MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT

IF THE SEX OF YOUR BODY ALWAYS AND BY DEFINITION MATCHES YOUR GENDER IDENTITY WHAT DOES IT EVEN MEAN TO BE TRANS

IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A TRANS PERSON IS SOMEONE WHOSE GENDER DIFFERS FROM THEIR SEX IF A TRANS WOMAN'S PHYSICAL SEX SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONSIDERED FEMALE ALONG WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY THEN WHAT ATTRIBUTE OF THAT PERSON DEFINES THEM AS TRANS IT COULD STILL BE THEIR ASSIGNED SEX I EAST THE SEX ON THEIR BIRTH CERTIFICATE AND OR THE SEX OTHERS PERCEIVE THEM AS BUT AGAIN THAT SHIFTS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A PERSON'S TRANSGRESS OUT OF THEIR OWN HANDS AND DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE REAL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL STRUGGLES THAT TRANS PEOPLE EXPERIENCE
ON MY VIEW THERE IS NOTHING MALE ABOUT A TRANS WOMAN THE TERM MALE IS SIMPLY NOT APPROPRIATE AS APPLIED TO TRANS WOMEN THEY DON T HAVE MALE BODY PARTS BECAUSE ONLY MALES HAVE MALE BODY PARTS AND ON MY VIEW TRANS WOMEN ARE NOT MALES BUT FEMALES SO ANY BODY PART OR PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC THEY HAVE IS ONLY APPROPRIATELY DESCRIBED AS FEMALE

THE GENDER SEX HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BODY PARTS BIOLOGICAL DEFINITION IS PURELY FOR MEDICAL HEALTH PURPOSES NOT THE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU HAVE OR LIKE SEXUALLY THAT'S WHAT GENDER IS FOR THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE ARGUMENT HERE IS WRONG SEX IS BIOLOGICAL GENDER IS A CULTURAL DESCRIPTIVE JUST BECAUSE YOU NO LONGER HAVE A PENIS DOESN'T MAKE YOU BIOLOGICALLY FEMALE AND THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL AND HEALTH SERVICES

THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT PRESENTED HERE HINGES SOLELY ON THE FACT OF CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD FOR NO REAL PURPOSE IT'S NECESSARY TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL STANDARDS AND MENTAL DIFFERENCES AND IS NOT A MEANS TO PROMOTE SEXIST TRANSPHOBIC AGENDAS


EDIT A LONG READ ON THE SUBJECT OF BOTH FEMALE MALE DIFFERENCES IN MEDICINE HEALTH AND THE INCLUSION OF GENDER IN SUCH PRACTICES
HOW CAN CHROMOSOMES BE ARBITRARY AND NOT CONTRIBUTE TO WHETHER WE ARE MALE OR FEMALE THEY DIRECTLY INFLUENCE OUR BRAIN CHARACTERISTICS

SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF LOGIC HANDWAVING ANYONE WITH A 6TH GRADE LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION AND A FOOTHOLD IN REAL LOGIC SHOULD FIND THIS LAUGHABLE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S A LOT MORE PRACTICAL TO STOP CREATING GENDER SPECIFIC LEGISLATION AND MAKE CURRENT LEGISLATION GENDER NEUTRAL THAN IT IS TO STOP DIFFERENTIATING GENDER ALL TOGETHER I FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST SEMANTICS AND NOTHING MORE I DON'T EVEN THINK GENDER IS DEFINED IN THE LAW SO MALE AND FEMALE ARE UP TO INTERPRETATION ANYWAY LEGALLY
THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THERE ARE DEEP PROBLEMS WITH GENDERING BODY PARTS BUT ISN'T CLEAR WHAT GENDERING MEANS THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS ELBOWS SAYING THERE ARE NO MALE OR FEMALE ELBOWS WHILE THERE ARE NO ELBOWS THAT ARE MALE OR FEMALE THIS IS TRUE IN THE SAME SENSE THAT THERE ARE NO MALE OR FEMALE TREES OR CLOUDS TREES CLOUDS AND ELBOWS ARE NEITHER MALES NOR FEMALES BUT THE AUTHOR CLAIMS THERE ARE NO MALE OR FEMALE ELBOWS THERE ARE JUST ELBOWS HERE THE ARGUMENT GOES AWRY THERE ARE NO DOG OR CAT ELBOWS IN THE SENSE OF THESE ELBOWS BEING DOGS OR CATS BUT THERE ARE THE ELBOWS OF DOGS AND CATS SIMILARLY THERE ARE NO MALE OR FEMALE ELBOWS BUT THERE ARE THE ELBOWS OF A MALE OR FEMALE THE THING IS A PART OF SOMETHING WITH A GENDER AND ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT THEREBY TO BE IDENTIFIED AS THAT GENDER I EAST YOU DO NOT SAY SHE ABOUT THE ELBOW OF A FEMALE YOU SAY IT THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT'S NOT EAST G A FEMALE THING

BLDR CONFUSING TWO USES OF MALE FEMALE X ONE WHERE X IS SAID TO BE A MALE FEMALE ONE WHERE X IS PART OF A MALE FEMALE

THE AUTHOR ALSO SAYS THAT WHEN EAST G DESCRIBING A NOSE IN FULL PHYSIOLOGICAL DETAIL WE WOULD NOT NEED TO ALSO SAY WHETHER IT IS MALE OR FEMALE TO GIVE A COMPLETE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION BUT THIS IS DUE TO THE EXAMPLE SHE GIVES WHERE WE ARE GIVEN THE STRANGE JOB OF DESCRIBING A NOSE IN FULL PHYSIOLOGICAL DETAIL AND IT WORKS JUST AS WELL FOR EAST G DOGS AND CATS IN THAT WE WOULD NOT NEED TO USE ANY GIVEN CATEGORY TO DESCRIBE ANYTHING IN FULL PHYSIOLOGICAL DETAIL PRESUMABLY THIS DOESN'T PROVE DOGS AND CATS ONLY DIFFER IN THOUGHT BUT WHY WOULD WE NEED TO DESCRIBE THINGS IN FULL PHYSIOLOGICAL DETAIL ANYWAY ARE WE CONSIDERING SOMEONE TRYING TO MAKE COMPLETELY REALISTIC MAPS OF BODY PARTS OR PEOPLE LIVING IN A SOCIETY THIS COMPLETELY APPROACH DOESN'T GET US ANYWHERE IN PHILOSOPHY
DOES ANYONE HERE GENUINELY THINK THAT ALL THE DIFFERENCES IN HORMONES GENE EXPRESSIONS BRAIN STRUCTURE ETC BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN BUILT UP OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS OF DIFFERENTIATED SOCIAL ROLES WILL JUST GO AWAY IF WE STOP CALLING IT DIFFERENT I THINK ALOT OF MODERN GENDER ROLES ARE CONSTRUCTED BUT THESE KINDS OF ARTICLES WOULD BE LAUGHED OUT OF A BIOLOGY LAB BEFORE YOU EVEN MADE YOUR POINT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE GOOD GENDER THEORY YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR BIOLOGICAL HOMEWORK
DELETED
IT IS A BASIC CONTRADICTION TO CLAIM SEX GENDER DISTINCTION SHOULD BE REMOVED AND THAT GENDER IS DETERMINED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO DEFINE THEMSELVES AS A CERTAIN GENDER THERE MUST BE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT GENDERS
WHY STOP THERE WHAT IF I IDENTIFIED AS A WOLF THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO IDENTIFY AS WOLVES AND GEESE AND BEARS DON'T LOOK FOR THEM DOES THAT MEAN MY GENOME IS NO LONGER REPRESENTATIVE OF A HUMAN IF I DECIDE SO DOES THAT MEAN I CAN ACTUALLY CONSIDER MYSELF A WOLF I UNDERSTAND IT'S AND THAT WE LIVE A IN WORLD BUT WHERE DOES IT END WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CATEGORIZATIONS OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE WILL MATH FOLLOW SUIT

I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE BORN WITH EXTREMELY DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT WARRANT A DISCUSSION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MALE OR FEMALE IN SOCIETY BUT TO DO SO AT THE EXPENSE OF DISMANTLING ALL THAT SCIENCE HAS ORGANIZED ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF NOT HURTING SOMEONE'S FEELING IS ABSOLUTELY DISHEARTENING AND NO THIS IS NOT INDICATIVE OF PARADIGMATIC SHIFTS YOU'RE NOT ADVANCING OR REVISING SCIENCE IN ANYWAY ALL YOU'RE DOING IS TRYING TO REDEFINE A TERM SO YOU FEEL BETTER
DELETED
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING I DO WONDER WHAT SOCIETY WOULD LOOK LIKE IF SEXUALITY WAS ABANDONED AS A NECESSARY SOCIAL CONSTRUCT ALTOGETHER WHEN ONE REALIZES THAT THERE ARE SO MANY VARIETIES OF PEOPLE OF ALL KINDA OF SEXUAL DISTINCTIONS ONE COMES TO REALIZE THAT THE MALE FEMALE STRUCTURE IS REALLY JUST AN ARBITRARY VIEW SET IN PLACE BY NOW FORMS OF THOUGHT BEYOND FOR REASONS OF BIOLOGICAL AND PERHAPS PSYCHOLOGICAL PURPOSES IS THEIR SEXUAL CONFIGURATION EVEN NECESSARY DOES KNOWING AND REFERRING TO PEOPLE AS MALE OR FEMALE OR ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN HELP SOCIETY
REMOVED
APPROACH IS EXPLICITLY IS HE DOESN'T HAVE TO SATISFY THE K YOUR OBJECTIONS TO NOVICK FAIL SO LONG AS THOSE CONDITIONS ARE MET THE FARMER KNOWS THAT THERE IS A SINGLE COW IN THE FIELD

THERE ARE OTHER EXTERNALIST OBJECTIONS TO APPROACH THOUGH SUCH THAT KNOWLEDGE WHILE SAFE IS LIMITED TO A SMALL SUBSET OF PRIMA FACIE INSTANCES OF KNOWLEDGE IT'S TOO RESTRICTIVE A CRITERIA
KNOWLEDGE IS THE STORED MENTAL CONTENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL EVEN IF IT'S FALSE OR INACCURATE IT'S STILL KNOWLEDGE

A PERSON MAY FOR EXAMPLE BE HEAVILY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT SUBJECT MATTER A HOWEVER ALL OF WHAT THEY KNOW IS INACCURATE THEY ARE STILL KNOWLEDGEABLE BUT WHAT THEY KNOW IS NOT WORTHY OF RESPECT THIS DESIGNATES IT AS UNDESIRED KNOWLEDGE STILL KNOWLEDGE THOUGH
I ALWAYS LIKED PROBLEM OF INDUCTION AS A SKEPTICAL ARGUMENT AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF KNOWLEDGE IT DOESN'T SAY THAT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ONLY THAT IT'S POSSIBLE WE MIGHT NOT KNOW ANYTHING DUE TO THE PRACTICE OF DRAWING GENERAL RULES FROM SPECIFIC INSTANCES THAT ARE CONSISTENT

THE EXAMPLE OFTEN CITED IS BECAUSE ALL SWANS OBSERVED ARE WHITE IT CAN BE CONCLUDE ALL SWANS ARE WHITE WE CAN SEE THAT THIS TYPE OF GENERALIZATION SUFFERS FROM LIMITED SCOPE OF OBSERVATION WHICH GOES IN HAND WITH KNOWLEDGE NEEDING TO BE JUSTIFIED IN WHICH CASE THIS IS HOWEVER ITS TRUTH CAN NEVER BE VERIFIED ONLY ITS FALSEHOOD I ALWAYS VIEWED IT AS JUSTIFIED BUT NOT NECESSARILY TRUE UNTIL FALSIFIED

THE OVERALL ISSUE WITH FORMING KNOWLEDGE THIS WAY IS THAT THE ONLY TIME WE ARE CERTAIN OF A STATEMENT'S TRUTH VALUE IS WHEN WE FIND AN EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY IT WILL NEVER BE POSITIVELY PROVEN

FOR EXAMPLE THE LAW OF GRAVITY EVERY OBSERVATION WE HAVE EVER MADE SUGGESTS THAT OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING IS CORRECT AND UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE HOWEVER A SINGLE EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE ONLY THING NECESSARY TO PROVE IT'S FALSEHOOD UNLESS WE CAN BE SURE THAT WE HAVE EXHAUSTIVELY OBSERVED ALL OF EXISTENCE OUR GENERALIZATIONS CAN NEVER BE CONFIRMED MERELY KNOWN TO BE EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
YOU SEEM TO BE CONFUSING KNOWLEDGE WITH CERTAINTY BUT THIS ISN'T A REQUIREMENT FOR ANY OF THE DEFINITIONS OF KNOWLEDGE YOU GIVE INDEED IT'S PRETTY WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT KNOWLEDGE CAN BE FALLIBLE IN YOUR FARMER WITH THE COW BUNKER THE FARMER HAS A JUSTIFIED BELIEF THAT THERE ARE NO COWS IN HIS FIELD IF IT HAPPENS THAT THERE IS NO SECRET COW BUNKER THEN THAT BELIEF IS ALSO TRUE AND SO I'D SAY THE FARMER DOES INDEED KNOW THIS FACT IF THERE DOES HAPPEN TO BE THAT SECRET COW THEN THE FARMER IS WRONG AND LACKS KNOWLEDGE EVEN THOUGH THEY BELIEVE THEY KNOW BUT THE DIFFERENCE THERE HINGES ON THE TRUTH CRITERIA NOT THIS EXTRA CERTAINTY ONE YOU'VE ADDED

AS SUCH I THINK YOU'RE ULTIMATELY ARGUING AGAINST THE WRONG THING YOU'RE OBJECTING TO CERTAINLY NOT KNOWLEDGE AND WHEN YOU SAY

I THUS ARGUE THAT KNOWLEDGE AS THE WORD IS CURRENTLY USED

YOU'RE ACTUALLY REFERENCING A USAGE THAT IS NOT OFTEN USED AT ALL

IT CAN THEN BE SAID THAT THE FARMER BELIEVES WITH PROBABILITY THAT THERE IS A COW IN THE FIELD

THERE'S NO REAL PROBLEM IN VIEWING KNOWLEDGE IN PROBABILISTIC TERMS THAT THERE'S SOME THRESHOLD OF CONFIDENCE OVER WHICH IT COUNTS AS KNOWING SOMETHING INDEED I'D SAY THIS REALLY APPIUS TO THE BELIEVING PART I BELIEVE X I AM CERTAIN OF X BUT THIS MISSES OUT SOME THINGS ABOUT KNOWLEDGE WHICH WE'RE PRETTY INTERESTED IN SPECIFICALLY THE TRUTH AND JUSTIFICATION CRITERIA IE I MAY ACCEPT THE FARMER IS CONFIDENT AND EVEN THAT THEY'RE JUSTIFIED IN THIS BELIEF BUT REFRAIN FROM CALLING IT KNOWLEDGE NOT BECAUSE I'VE ANY OBJECTION TO PROBABILISTIC VIEWS BUT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE IS A SECRET COW BUNKER AND SO THE FARMER IS WRONG OR PERHAPS THE FARMER IS RIGHT BUT BELIEVES THIS BECAUSE HE THINKS HE'S PSYCHIC AND WOULD KNOW IF THERE WAS A COW THERE EVEN IF HE HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A JUSTIFIED MEANS OF REACHING THE CONCLUSION

BUT IF NEITHER OF THESE IS THE CASE I DON'T THINK THERE'D BE ANYTHING WRONG WITH CALLING THE BELIEF KNOWLEDGE EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE INCLUDING HIM ADMITS HE COULD BE WRONG WE USE IT THIS WAY EVERY DAY IN PRETTY MUCH ALL OUR CLAIMS ABOUT WHAT IS AND IS NOT KNOWLEDGE IE GETTING A QUESTION ON A QUIZ WRONG WHICH WE THOUGH WE KNEW DOESN'T CAUSE US TO STUBBORNLY PERSIST IN OUR CERTAINTY RATHER WE ADMIT OUR ERROR THUS SHOWING THAT OUR NOTION OF THE CONCEPT IS INHERENTLY FALLIBILISTIC

YOU'RE OVERTHINKING THE CONCEPT OF KNOWLEDGE AND CONFUSING IT WITH THE TERM FOR INFORMATION KNOWLEDGE IS A TOOL TO BE USE TO PROVE THAT THE INFORMATION RECEIVED IS INDEED FACT OR FALSE AS YOU GATHER INFORMATION TRUE OR FALSE YOU BECOME MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THAT SUBJECT LETS SAY YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE FLOWER CALLED ROSE WHATSOEVER SO YOU DECIDE TO GATHER INFORMATION YOU READ SOMEWHERE AND YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY POPULAR OPINION THAT A ROSE IS RED ALTHOUGH THIS IS CONSIDERED TO BE TRUE THE INFORMATION RECEIVED IS FALSE SOME WOULD ARGUE BUT IT'S STILL FALSE THE ROSE COMES IN A VARIETY OF COLORS BUT YOU ACQUIRED INFORMATION THAT MADE YOU MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT ROSES KNOWLEDGE IS WHAT YOU KNOW TO BE FACT I E 2
THIS ALL RESTS ON YOUR DEFINITION OF THE WORD KNOWLEDGE YOU'VE TOLD ME WHAT IT ISN'T NOW TELL ME WHAT IT IS BECAUSE IF KNOWLEDGE IS SOMETHING THAT IS KNOWN BY A GIVEN PERSON BY THEIR OWN FRAME OF REFERENCE THAT KNOWLEDGE IS ACCURATE REGARDLESS OF THE ACTUAL TRUTH IF FARMER A SEES COW IN THE FIELD YET YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE BENEATH THE FIELD FROM FARMER A'S FRAME OF REFERENCE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE COW EXISTS IN THE FIELD IS TRUE AND ACCURATE
THE RULES OF PROBABILITY THEORY NEED TO BE CERTAIN FOR YOUR ARGUMENT TO WORK ALSO THERE IS THE FACT THAT IF YOU CLAIM SOMETHING IS PROBABLE YOU NEED TO HAVE EVIDENCE FOR THAT CLAIM AND THE EVIDENCE WILL EVENTUALLY NEED TO BOTTOM OUT AT SOMETHING CERTAIN
SOME WORDS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN THEIR PRACTICAL USE LIKE I THINK KNOWLEDGE SOME WORDS DON'T HAVE A DEFINITION LIKE GAME YOU CANNOT FIND A DEFINITION WHICH DOESN'T EXCLUDE ANYTHING OR INCLUDES THINGS WHICH WOULD NOT FIT

USING YOUR MODEL OF PROBABILITY WOULDN'T BE PRACTICAL JUST THINK OF HOW TEDIOUS CERTAIN CONVERSATIONS OR DISCUSSIONS WOULD BE DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT HOW TEACHING WOULD BE IF IT WOULD NOT HAVE ANY PRACTICAL USE AND MAYBE EVEN THE OPPOSITE OF THAT WHY WOULD YOU IMPLEMENT IT WHEN THE MODEL WE USE RIGHT NOW HAS NEVER LED TO ANY PROBLEMS
I AGREE WITH THE DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE AS SOMETHING THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN TO BE CORRECT HOWEVER I DISAGREE THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS KNOWLEDGE THIS IS BECAUSE WE CAN DEFINE CERTAIN THINGS SUCH THAT THEY MUST BE CORRECT IN MATHEMATICS FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE DEFINED THE MEANINGS OF 2 AND SUCH THAT WE CAN KNOW FOR ABSOLUTE CERTAIN THAT 2 IS A TRUE STATEMENT
I THINK THE GETTER PROBLEM IS OVERSTATED

USING YOUR EXAMPLE THE GUY WALKS PAST A FIELD SEES A CARDBOARD COW THINKS IT IS A REAL COW HIS BELIEF THAT A COW IS IN THE FIELD IS AORTA TRUE IN A GENERAL SENSE BUT IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED BECAUSE HIS BELIEF IS BASED ON THE MISTAKE THAT THE CARDBOARD COW IS A REAL COW BEING MISTAKEN ABOUT SOMETHING IS NOT A JUSTIFICATION

THAT THERE IS A REAL COW IN THE FIELD IS ACCIDENTAL AND INCIDENTAL ITS PRESENCE IN THE FIELD ONLY MAKES THE BELIEF THAT THERE IS A COW IN THE FIELD TRUE IN A GENERAL SENSE IT IS STILL SPECIFICALLY FALSE THAT THERE IS A COW RIGHT THERE AT THAT VERY SPOT IN THE FIELD WHERE THE CARDBOARD COW IS

OR RATHER THERE IS A COW IN THE FIELD IS ONLY TRUE INSOFAR AS COW GENERALLY MEANS ANY STRUCTURE BEARING THE FORM OF A COW AND NOT SPECIFICALLY A REAL LIVING COW

EDIT

I DO NOT CONSIDER PAST OBSERVATIONS CERTAIN BECAUSE MEMORIES CAN BE LOST OR MISTAKEN

THIS IS VERY WRONGTHINK AND YOU'RE TRAPPED IN THE SKEPTICISM READ SOME HEGEL PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT TO MOVE ON

BEING ABLE TO HAVE LOST OR MISTAKEN MEMORIES IS THE NECESSARY NEGATIVE CONDITION REQUIRED TO HAVE CORRECT MEMORIES YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO AND BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WRONG TO KNOW HOW TO AND BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT

WE DON'T SAY OH SINCE PEOPLE SOMETIMES LIE WE SHOULD NEVER BELIEVE ANYTHING ANYONE SAYS

I'M CERTAIN THAT YOUR UNDERNAME IS ARRECTOR EVEN THOUGH I'VE FORGOTTEN MY GRANDMOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME
SENSES RELY ON INPUT AND THE ABILITY TO COMPREHEND REALITY RELIES ON HOW ONES BRAIN SYNTHESIZES AND BRIDGES THE SENSES TO CREATE AN INDIVIDUALS CONSCIOUSNESS IT'S ALL IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN SENSES THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN DIFFERENT MODS OF HUMAN AWARENESS

PHILOSOPHY IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN THAT THROUGH DISCUSSION METAPHOR ONE CAN CONSTRUCT AND REPAIR THOUGHTS STRUCTURES AND EVEN CREATE NEW KNOWLEDGE THROUGH DIALOGUE

THE DIFFICULT ASPECTS OF COMMUNICATION IS THAT WITHOUT SENSORY INPUT BEYOND THE WORD TEXT OR AUDIBLE INPUT THE ONLY SUBJECTIVE TRUTH IS WHAT PEOPLE RECEIVE OBJECTIVE TRUTHS ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPLEX TO UNDERSTAND UNTIL ADEQUATE AND THOROUGH EXPOSURE ALLOWS FOR A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE

PEOPLE ARE A DIME A DOZEN FRIENDS ARE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH IF WE REMOVE LABELS AND TREAT PEOPLE AS INDIVIDUALS ON FIRST ENCOUNTER CONNECTIONS AND COMMUNITY ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP

CASTLES WERE NEVER MEANT FOR A HANDFUL OF INDIVIDUALS BUT FOR VILLAGES AND KINGDOMS IF THERE ARE NO APPOINTED COURTS THAN THE STRUCTURE IS RELIANT ON THE MEMBERS AND GOALS OF A GROUP

CASTLE IS THE MIND HE ONLY LEFT FOR PEOPLE THAT COULD SHAPE A BETTER ENVIRONMENT ASK IVY AND SASHA ABOUT PHILOSOPHY MILLS IS INTEGRAL FOR LIBERTY JUSTICE AND FREE THOUGHT EXPRESSION AND FREEDOM GENDER BALANCE AND EQUITY IN POLITICAL AND CULTURAL STRUCTURES WERE ONE OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT AND RELEVANT PROJECTS THAT REINFORCES INDIVIDUAL DEMOCRACY INTERNATIONALLY
I'D ARGUE THAT KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEVE ARE MERE STATES OF A CONCEPT

IN MY ARGUMENT CONCEPT IS DEFINED TO BE A SERIES OF RELATIONS AND RELATIONS ARE A NEAT WAY TO DESCRIBE INFORMATION
SO A CONCEPT IS BASICALLY A SET CONTAINING INFORMATION IN RELATION TO EACH OTHER

IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN WE OBTAIN A CONSTANT STREAM OF INFORMATION OVER VARIOUS INPUTS OUR BRAIN DOES IT'S MAGIC AND STARTS TO RELATE THE INPUTS TO EACH OTHER THE END PRODUCTS ARE VARIOUS CONCEPTS EACH REPRESENTING A RANGE OF INPUTS THEY ARE ANY GIVEN MOMENT SINCE THE INPUTS HAVE TO BE PRESENT IN ORDER FOR THE CONCEPT TO UPHOLD

MANY OF THOSE CONCEPTS START TO RELATE TO EACH OTHER AND FORM ABSTRACTIONS OF INFORMATION AND ABSTRACTIONS IN TURN CAN RELATE TO EACH ANOTHER AND FORM NEW ONES

SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE WE GET A SPECIFIC ABSTRACTION IT IS ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE EVALUABILITY OF VARIOUS SETS OF INPUTS CONCEPTS OR SIMPLY INFORMATION ON A SCALE LIKE THIS

INHERENTLY TRUE MOSTLY TRUE UNDEFINED MOSTLY FALSE INHERENTLY FALSE

AND WE USE LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE SPECIFIC REGIONS ON THIS SCALE

KNOWLEDGE COVERS EVERYTHING FROM INHERENTLY TRUE TO ROUGHLY THE BETTER HALF OF MOSTLY TRUE
AND BELIEVE COVERS A BLURRED RANGE FROM MOSTLY TRUE TO MOSTLY FALSE

THE PLACEMENT CAN ALSO CHANGE ANY GIVEN MOMENT SINCE THE UNDERLYING CONCEPTS ARE

WHICH MAKES THE WORD KNOWLEDGE AN INDICATOR MARKING THAT INFORMATION IS AND WAS MOSTLY TRUE WITHIN THE GIVEN CONDITIONS INPUTS UP UNTIL NOW ON A MORE OR LESS COMMONLY USED REFERENCE SCALE AND THUS MAKING THE WORD KNOWLEDGE AND THE LIKES IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNICATION
ISN'T SAYING THERE IS NO THING LIKE KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE IN ITSELF
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS MORE OF AN ISSUE WITH THE CERTAINTY OF A FACT RATHER THAN KNOWLEDGE ITSELF

FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IF THE FARMER WAS PUT IN AN EMPTY ROOM WITH THE COW CLOSE TO HIM HE KNOWS THAT THERE IS A COW BUT IN THIS EXAMPLE THERE CANNOT BE ANOTHER COW HIDING SOMEWHERE AND THE FARMER CAN SEE THAT IT IS A COW OPPOSED TO A CUT OUT

HE STILL KNOWS THERE IS A COW NEARBY BUT THE CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED SUCH THAT THERE IS WITHOUT A DOUBT AN ACTUAL COW THUS IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE CHALLENGED CERTAINTY RATHER THAN INTERPRETATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE FROM WHAT I SEE
ALL OF YOU MAKE ME FEEL STUPID WITH HOW ELOQUENT YOU ARE BUT I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT I FEEL AS THOUGH I CAN NEVER TRULY KNOW ANYTHING I HAVE HEARD THAT PEOPLE INCORRECTLY BELIEVE SOCRATES TO HAVE SAID THAT THE ONLY THING HE IS CERTAIN OF IS THAT HE CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN OF ANYTHING MAYBE HE NEVER SAID THAT BUT I STILL BELIEVE IT IS TRUE

AND TO RESPOND TO YOUR COW IN THE FIELD SCENARIO CAN'T HE BE CERTAIN OF HIS OWN BELIEFS DOESN'T HIS KNOWLEDGE EXIST TRULY IN THAT HE BELIEVES A COW TO BE IN A FIELD WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ONE AND EVEN IF ONE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THERE IS A COW IN THE FIELD OR THERE ISN'T CORRECT IF THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH IS THAT THERE IS A COW INDEED IN THAT FIELD THEN ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THE COW IS THERE WOULD HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE DOES HUMANITY HAVE TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHAT THE TRUTH IS FOR US TO HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF EXISTENCE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT WE BELIEVE AND WHAT IS TRUE EXISTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN KNOW SOMETHING IS FOR CERTAIN

FURTHERMORE AS I'VE COME TO SEE IT KNOWLEDGE IS MERELY HAVING THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOMETHING CAN OUR BELIEFS OF SOMETHING COUNT AS KNOWLEDGE REGARDLESS OF TRUTH IF WE BELIEVE SOMETHING TO BE ONE WAY DO WE HAVE THESE POWER TO SAY THAT'S LESS VALUABLE THAN THE TRUTH IF YOUR ONLY PURPOSE IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU SEE A COW THEN DOES IT MATTER WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ACTUALLY A COW
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN'T REALLY LIKE GETTER PROBLEM HERE THE FARMER WOULD HAVE TO BE PRETTY BLIND TO NOT REALIZE THAT THE COW WAS A CUT-OUT BUT OTHER EXAMPLES AREN'T REALLY BETTER WITH OTHER EXAMPLES INCLUDING BARNS WHICH AREN'T REALLY BARNS AND ZEBRAS WHICH AREN'T REALLY ZEBRAS WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE PHILOSOPHICAL POINT BEING MADE AND REALIZE THAT THE EXAMPLES COULD ALWAYS JUST KEEP RATCHETING UP CANNOT WE USE BETTER EXAMPLES

WHY CANNOT THE FARMER HAVE DNA EVIDENCE THAT THE COW IS A COW WHY CANNOT THE DRIVER STOP GET OUT OF THE CAR AND EXAMINE THE BARN FOR HALF AND HOUR BEFORE BEING JUSTIFIED IN GENERAL MY ISSUE WITH ALMOST ALL OF THESE EXAMPLES IS THAT JUSTIFIED IS BEING USED FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR TOO LOOSELY TAKING A QUICK GLANCE AT SOMETHING IS NOT SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION FOR SOMETHING TO BE CONSIDERED KNOWLEDGE

JUSTIFIED TRUE BELIEF IS A MEANINGFUL CONCEPT IF WE TAKE JUSTIFIED TO MEAN TOOK ALL POSSIBLE PRECAUTIONS TO NOT BE WRONG ATB MAY NOT BE EQUIVALENT TO KNOWLEDGE BUT AT LEAST IT WOULD REFER TO SOMETHING USEFUL PERHAPS SOMETHING MORE AKIN TO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT

THANKS FOR THE VIDEO I'M A FAN OF THIS SERIES

HOW WOULD CONTRASTIVISTS REPLY TO THE FOLLOWING POINT I FEEL IS UNANSWERED BY THEIR APPROACH INSOFAR AS IT WAS EXPLAINED IN THE VIDEO

THIS FORMULATION OF KNOWLEDGE STILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THE LACK OF CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING ALTERNATE POSSIBILITIES ARE WORTH DISMISSING

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO WRITES OFF PHILOSOPHERS WHO SAY THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO PROVE THAT A MAGICIAN DIDN'T TRICK US OR OTHER SUCH POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE THOSE POSSIBILITIES ARE TOO FAR-FETCHED HE CLAIMS

THEY OWE US SOME ACCOUNT OF WHICH POSSIBILITIES ARE TOO FAR-FETCHED

HOWEVER AT THE END OF THE VIDEO HE WRITES OFF SKEPTICS WHO SEEM TO POSE THAT SAME ISSUE WITH HIS FORMULATION

SUCH SKEPTICISM HAS SOME INSIGHT AND SOME ERROR IT IS CORRECT IN THAT NOBODY CAN KNOW ANYTHING IN CONTRAST WITH ALL POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS SOME POSSIBILITY THAT THEY CAN'T RULE OUT BUT IT'S STILL MISLEADING BECAUSE WE CAN KNOW A LOT IN CONTRAST WITH NORMAL POSSIBILITIES NAMELY THE ONES THAT WE CAN CHECK AND THE ONES THAT ARE WORTH TAKING SERIOUSLY EMPHASIS MINE

I WOULD AGREE THAT THE S KNOWS P IN CONTRAST WITH Q FORMULATION IS POWERFUL BECAUSE IT MORE ACCURATELY CAPTURES ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE OF A SITUATION LIKE THIS RATHER THAN SEVERAL STATEMENTS OF THE FORM S KNOWS P AND S KNOWS NOT FOR EACH IN Q BUT IT STILL FEELS LIKE HE'S SLIPPING IN AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT WHICH POSSIBILITIES ARE WORTH TAKING SERIOUSLY I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT TRULY MAKES S KNOWS P IN CONTRAST WITH Q POWERFUL IS WHAT WE CHOOSE TO PUT IN QUEEN SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ADDRESSED BY CONTRASTIVISM
SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO WALTER DUKE UNIVERSITY INTRODUCES A NEW APPROACH TO KNOWLEDGE CONTRASTIVISM

THANKS FOR WATCHING IF YOU LIKE OUR VIDEOS PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL

WIPHI
I UNDERSTAND WHY ONE COULD WITH THE REASONING DESCRIBED IN THE VIDEO REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT P IS LIKELY TO BE TRUE OR THAT IT IS REASONABLE AND BENEFICIAL TO TREAT P AS TRUE OR THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT TO BE TRUE AS OPPOSED TO Q BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY MAKE THE LEAP TO CLAIM IT IS TRUE OR WHAT TRUE IN RELATION TO EVEN MEANS

IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE JUST LOOSENING UP THE WORD TRUE TO MEAN JUSTIFIED BELIEF
I'M CURIOUS WHAT A CONTRASTIVIST WOULD SAY ABOUT A CASE WHERE IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE THAT EAST G THAT THE IDENTICAL TWIN AND NOT THE BOSS HIMSELF WAS KILLED BY THE BUTLER THE CONTRASTIVIST BELIEVING THAT THE BUTLER KILLED HIS BOSS WILL SAY I KNOW THAT THE BUTLER KILLED HIS BOSS IN CONTRAST WITH THE COOK KILLING HIS BOSS BUT WILL IT ACTUALLY BE CORRECT THAT THE CONTRASTIVIST HAS THIS KNOWLEDGE NEITHER ANSWER SEEMS SATISFYING FOR IF THE ANSWER IS YES THEN OUR KNOWLEDGE IS NO LONGER FACTIVE AND WE CAN KNOW THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE AS LONG AS THEY'RE KNOWN IN CONTRAST WITH OTHER THINGS THAT AREN'T TRUE AND IT SEEMS LIKE A CONCEPTUAL REQUIREMENT ON KNOWLEDGE THAT ONLY TRUE CLAIMS CAN BE KNOWN AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY CONTRASTIVISM IS SUPPOSED TO OFFER A STRONGER REPLY TO THE SKEPTIC THAN THE TRADITIONAL TWO-PLACE ACCOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE
REMOVED
I PERSONALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW CONTRASTIVISTS ARE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN IN ANY CERTAIN TERMS WHAT IS UNLIKELY TO BE TRUE WHY EXACTLY IS THE TWIN SCENARIO LESS LIKELY THAN THE BUTLER SCENARIO I SUPPOSE AN ANSWER COULD BE BECAUSE IN OUR EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES THOSE AREN'T THE SORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES WE SEE PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED THAN TO FAKE THEIR DEATH WITH THEIR IDENTICAL TWIN BUT THIS ARGUMENT IS FLAWED IN THAT PEOPLE DO FAKE THEIR DEATHS IN THIS WAY AND SAYING THAT IT'S UNTRUE JUST BECAUSE IT IS UNLIKELY ELIMINATES ANY REASONABLE INQUIRY INTO SUCH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
DOESN'T THE TECHNIQUE OF INTRODUCING THE MAGICIAN MEAN THERE DOESN'T EVEN EXIST A CONTRASTING PROPOSITION Q THAT IS TRULY KNOWN
HOW ABOUT WE INSTEAD OF STATING THAT WE THIS OR THAT ASSIGN PROBABILITIES TO STATEMENTS DON'T MANY OR ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS GO AWAY THEN
I LOVE THE END AND GET ON WITH OUR LIVES IT REALLY ENCAPSULATES THE MOOD AFTER SOME REALLY INTENSE PHILOSOPHY LECTURES
HE DID WHAT IN HIS MYOLOGY

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS I ALSO HAD A DIFFICULT TIME WITH THE VIDEO AND GROKKING EVERYTHING
WHY DOES NO LINE OF ARGUMENT CONSIDER THE PROBABILITY OF KNOWING SOMETHING IS TRUE PERHAPS WE CAN'T KNOW ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY BUT WE CAN GET PRETTY CLOSE I FEEL THIS PROBABILISTIC LINE OF REASONING WOULD PRETTY EASILY SOLVE THIS PARADOX PERHAPS THIS IS OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THE ARGUMENT WHICH ONLY CONSIDERS ABSOLUTES
MANUAL I HATE SKEPTICISM ITS AN NEVER ENDING DEBATE OR CAN THERE BE AN END TO THE DEBATE

ANSWER YOU DON'T KNOW

EDIT SEE
IS EPISTEMOLOGY CARTESIAN IN PART
REMOVED
THIS APPROACH AT THE BEGINNING CONSIDERATION OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS IS SIMILAR TO THAT USED IN FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS BUT THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE YOU CAN ASSIGN DIFFERENT PROBABILITIES FOR EACH EVENT YOU GET LESS AND LESS PROBABLE EVENTS WHILE CONSIDERING MORE AND MORE POSSIBLE CASES
YOU CAN'T REALLY KNOW FOR SURE BUT YOU CAN KNOW WITH GREAT PROBABILITY FOR EXAMPLE IS FINE FOR PRACTICALLY ALL CASES FOUND IN LIFE
OF COURSE IT IS QUITE PROBLEMATIC TO ASSIGN SPECIFIC VALUES OF PROBABILITY BUT CERTAIN EVENTS ARGUMENTS EXPERIMENTS CAN ASSIGN LOWER OR HIGHER PROBABILITY TO A PARTICULAR EVENT

RELATED
I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE I WISH I HAD KNOWLEDGE I'M SO DUMB EXISTENCE LAUGHS AT ME AND SIMPLICITY DERIDES MY BEING WHY WAS I EVER BORN
I'M NEW TO THIS SUB AND PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL BUT ISN'T POPPERIAN FALLIBILISM THE LEADING THEORY IN EPISTEMOLOGY RIGHT NOW WHAT'S DISCUSSED IN THIS VIDEO CONTRASTIVISM SEEMS MUCH LESS CONVINCING AND SIMPLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE WAY IN WHICH WE GO ABOUT ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE NOT TO MENTION WHAT KNOWLEDGE ACTUALLY IS

FOR EXAMPLE HOW WOULD YOU CONTRAST THE QUESTION WHY DID THE BUTLER DO IT AGAINST ANYTHING YOU WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION USING THIS METHOD OF REASONING


I DIDNT UNDERSTAND THE VIDEO CAN SOME ELI
EDUCATIONAL AND FUN THE ANIMATIONS ARE SILLY BUT ACTUALLY INTERESTING
REMOVED
SO I THINK WHAT YOU MAY BE TALKING ABOUT IS A CHARACTERISTICALLY VERSION OF UTILITARIANISM GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF CURIOSITIES LIKE UTILITY FUNCTION AND OF COURSE THE EMPHASIS ON BAYESIANISM I'M NOT REALLY SURE IF IS OR IS MEANT TO BE THE SAME THING AS IT IS IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I'LL PROCEED AS THOUGH IT WERE

FIRST UTILITARIANISM IS NOT PARTICULARLY A THEORY ABOUT HOW TO MEASURE UTILITY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE FELICIFIC CALCULUS FOR EXAMPLE BUT UTILITARIANISM ITSELF IS A CLAIM ABOUT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH AN ACTION ACTUALLY IS RIGHT RATHER THAN HOW WE CAN KNOW IT IS SO IN THE CASE OF CLASSICAL UTILITARIANISM THE THEORY IS THAT AN ACTION IS MORALLY RIGHT IF IT MAXIMIZES THE PLEASURE AND MINIMIZES THE PAIN IN THE WORLD NOT A PARTICULAR SOCIETY MIND YOU BUT FOR EVERYONE PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATE AROUND UTILITARIANISM MAINLY FOCUSSES AROUND WHETHER THIS MAKES SENSE AS A WAY TO UNDERSTAND MORALITY

SECOND THE PURPOSE OF THE UTILITY MONSTER OBJECTION IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ACTUALLY ARE UTILITY MONSTERS MUCH LESS THAT POOR PEOPLE ARE THESE IT'S A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT DESIGNED TO SHOW A COUNTERINTUITIVE OUTCOME OF THE UTILITARIAN APPROACH

HERE'S AN EXAMPLE SUPPOSE OUR STANDARD OF UTILITY IS THE CLASSIC ONE MAXIMIZING PLEASURE IN THE WORLD SUPPOSE A MAD SCIENTIST CREATES A SENTIENT AI WITH ONLY TWO PURPOSES TO CONSUME RESOURCES AND TO BE MASSIVELY INSANELY UNREASONABLY HAPPY ABOUT DOING SO SO LIKE IF GETTING A BILL MAKES ANY PERSON AT LEAST A LITTLE HAPPY THIS AI IS TRANSPORTED TO DIMENSIONS OF UNIMAGINABLE BLISS IF SOMEONE SLIPS IT A NICKEL IF THIS AI EXISTED AND UTILITARIANISM IS TRUE THEN THE MORALLY RIGHT THING WOULD BE TO FEED ABSOLUTELY ALL POSSIBLE RESOURCES TO IT IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE UTILITY AND LET EVERYONE GO WITHOUT YET INTUITIVELY THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO AT ALL
IF WHAT YOU WANT IS TO HAVE SOMEBODY GIVE YOU A PRIMER ON UTILITARIANISM AND HOW WHAT YOU CONSIDER MATCHES UP TO THE BEST CURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF IT YOU'D BE WELL SERVED BY ALSO POSTING THIS TO R ASKPHILOSOPHY WHERE THERE ARE QUALIFIED PEOPLE WHO ANSWER PHILOSOPHIC QUESTIONS AND WE MODERATE ANSWERS FOR ACCURACY AND INFORMATIVENESS YOU'VE ALREADY HAD RESPONSES HERE THAT ARE STRICTLY SPEAKING WRONG ABOUT UTILITARIANISM AS AN INTELLECTUAL TRADITION AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY
UTILITARIANISM SHOULD BE APPROACHED AS A HEURISTIC NOT A FORMULATION IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO NAIL DOWN ANY OBJECTIVE SENSE OF VALUE OR UTILITY HUMANS CAN ONLY MAKE BEST GUESSES THE UTILITY OF ANY OBJECT TO ANY ONE PERSON WILL CHANGE AS THAT PERSON GAINS EXPERIENCE AND HAS A CHANGE IN VALUES A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE MIGHT INITIALLY HAVE NEGATIVE UTILITY BUT PROVIDE POSITIVE UTILITY LATER IN LIFE WE CANNOT DEFINE A RIGID QUANTIFICATION OF UTILITY FOR EVEN A SINGLE PERSON'S LIFE BECAUSE OF SUBJECTIVITY SIMILARLY WE CANNOT MEASURE THE VALUE OF UTILITY BETWEEN PEOPLE WITHOUT SOME CONVERSION RATE OF UTILITY THAT HAS TO BE PRESCRIBED FROM SOME OTHER MORAL THEORY IS EVERY LIFE EQUAL OR ARE SOME LIVES ENTITLED TO MORE UTILITY THAN OTHERS DO THE UNBORN ENJOY UTILITY HOW ABOUT THE UNBORN THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OR HOW ABOUT ANIMALS AND OBJECTS THERE'S NO SATISFYING SOLUTION BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW CONTRADICTIONS FROM ANY THEORY THAT PRESCRIBES A MEASURABLE VALUE TO LIFE WE MIGHT SAY THAT THE ONLY VALID SOLUTION IS THE TRIVIAL ONE WHERE EVERYTHING EVERYONE AND EVERY SINGLE PARTICLE FORCE OR NAMEABLE OBJECT EXPERIENCES ZERO UTILITY FOR NOW AND FOREVER FOR REASONS SUCH AS THESE AND A FEW MORE UTILITARIANISM OF COURSE CAN NEVER FULLY BE A SOCIAL DICTUM WITH SOCIETY PRESCRIPTED AS PART OF A GIANT UTILITY MAXIMIZING MACHINE

IF YOU THINK OF UTILITARIANISM INSTEAD AS A TOOL BY HUMANS WHO REMAIN EVER IGNORANT YET ARE EVER SEEKING FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES AND FURTHER THEIR GOALS THEN IT'S REALLY FINE AS IT IS WITH ITS FLAWED SIMPLICITY INSTEAD WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT UTILITY IS RELATIVE AS IS EVERYTHING ELSE AND SO TRYING TO CONSTRUCT AN ULTIMATE UTILITY CURVE IS IMPOSSIBLE THIS MAY SEEM FUNDAMENTALLY UNSATISFYING BUT THEN AGAIN THAT'S NOT A NEW SENTIMENT IMAGINE HOW THE LOGICISES FELT WHEN THEY REALIZED THEY COULD NEVER GROUND THEIR LOGIC ON FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH

SO WE MUST INSTEAD CONSTRUCT SUBJECTIVE MEASURES OF UTILITY WHILE BEING FRANK ABOUT THE FLAWS OF ANY MEASURE WE USE TYPICALLY WE VALUE THE UTILITY OF THE MANY OVER THE POOR THE LIVING OVER THE THE NEAR FUTURE OVER THE FAR FUTURE AND SO ON WE PLUG IN ARBITRARY NUMBERS MAKE EDUCATED GUESSES ON CARDINALITY TO IMPROVE WE HAVE TO BUILD OUR SYSTEMS OF UTILITY APPROXIMATIONS BY SLOWLY ADDING MORE VARIABLES AND TWEAKING DIFFERENTIALS AWARE OF ITS FLAWS WHILE BEING WILLING TO TOTALLY SWAP THE WHOLE SET OF EQUATIONS WHENEVER WE ARE PRESENTED WITH A GOOD REASON TO DO SO
STRIPPED DOWN TO THE BASICS UTILITARIANISM SEEMS LIKE A GREAT ETHICAL FRAMEWORK IT'S SIMPLISTIC AND CAN BE USED IN ANY ETHICAL OR MORAL DILEMMA HOWEVER THINGS START TO GET MURKY WHEN IT COMES TO REAL WORLD ETHICAL DILEMMAS I LIKE CRITIQUE ON HOW BENTHAM FAILS TO TAKE IN TO ACCOUNT THE CHANGING CHARACTER OF PEOPLE MARX ALSO MENTIONS HOW HUMAN NATURE IS DYNAMIC AND THAT THE CONCEPT OF A SINGLE UTILITY IS ONE DIMENSIONAL
UTILITARIANISM IS FALLACIOUS
THIS IS MY FAVORITE ARGUMENT AGAINST UTILITARIANISM I DIDN'T SEE IT INCLUDED IN YOUR ORIGINAL POST SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO YOU

FIRST LET'S ESTABLISH THAT UTILITARIANISM IS INTENDED AS A GENERAL ETHICAL THEORY IT IS MEANT TO COVER ALL CASES UNDER ALL SCOPES YOU SEEM TO BE KEEN ON THIS REQUIREMENT IN PARAGRAPH OF OP AND YOUR REJOINDER FURTHERMORE I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT UTILITARIANISM PLAYS DOUBLE DUTY AS A PRACTICAL ETHICAL THEORY AND A THEORY UTILITARIANISM TELLS US WHAT GOODNESS IS AND WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO ALL AT ONCE GIVEN ENOUGH OPTIMISM A CONCRETE THEORY MIGHT ALSO TELL US EXACTLY HOW GOODS ARE DISTRIBUTED AND CHOICES SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED

NOW LET'S CONSIDER SOME SEEMINGLY PLAUSIBLE CASES ONES IN WHICH A GIVEN BELIEF DECREASES OVERALL UTILITY FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY SOMEONE IS UNDER THE FALSE BELIEF THAT THE WORLD WILL END NEXT TUESDAY THIS WOULD SURELY CAUSE UNNECESSARY DISTRESS FOR THE PERSON HOLDING SUCH A BELIEF THIS SEEMS LIKE AN EASY CASE WHERE CHANGING THE BELIEF IS THE RIGHT THING DO WE CAN ALSO CONSIDER CASES OF TRUE BELIEFS CAUSING PROBLEMS THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE ONE COULD DEVELOP OVERWHELMING ANGST ABOUT THE DEATH OF THE SUN IN THE DISTANT FUTURE THIS SEEMS LIKE A CASE WHERE ABANDONING THE BELIEF WON'T DO BUT CHANGING ONE'S ATTITUDE IS DEFINITELY A LIVE OPTION

BRINGING ALL OF THIS TOGETHER LET'S CONSIDER A THIRD CASE ONE IN WHICH BELIEVING UTILITARIANISM IS TRUE DECREASES OVERALL UTILITY WHILE SOME MIGHT OBJECT TO THIS AS A GOTCHA CASE LET'S REMEMBER THAT UTILITARIANISM IS A GENERAL ETHICAL THEORY INTENDED TO COVER ALL POSSIBLE CASES THIS CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE A CONCEIVABLE SCENARIO REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU THINK THE ODDS OF SUCH A THING OCCURRING I WILL HOWEVER ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH CASES IF ANYONE HAS OBJECTIONS

IN SUCH A CASE WHAT DOES UTILITARIANISM TELL US ON ONE HAND THE UTILITARIAN MUST AT LEAST BELIEVE THAT UTILITY IS A DETERMINABLE PROPERTY AND WE SHOULD ACT IN ACCORDANCE TO UTILITY ON THE OTHER HAND BELIEVING BOTH OF THESE THINGS DECREASES OVER ALL UTILITY THEREFORE WE MUST EITHER CHANGE THE FIRST BELIEF CHANGE THE SECOND BELIEF OR CHANGE OUR SOME COMPONENT OF THE BELIEF AS IN THE SECOND CASE CONSIDERED ABOVE ALL OF THESE OPTION YIELD BAD CONSEQUENCES

IF YOU GIVE UP THE BELIEF THAT UTILITY IS DETERMINABLE IN THIS CASE THEN UTILITARIANISM HAS RENDERED AN INCONCLUSIVE RESULT THE THEORY CAN'T PROVIDE PRACTICAL OR THEORETICAL GUIDANCE IN THIS CASE IN ANY FORM SINCE UTILITY ISN'T KNOWABLE IN SUCH CASES IF YOU GIVE UP THE BELIEF THAT WE SHOULD ACT IN ACCORDANCE TO UTILITY THEN UTILITARIANISM LOOSES ITS NORMATIVE QUALITY THE FACT THAT A GIVEN UTILITY IS PRODUCED WOULD BE OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO WHAT ONE SHOULD DO

AT ANY RATE LOSING EITHER BELIEF FALSIFIES UTILITARIANISM IF BELIEVING IN UTILITARIANISM IMPLIES ONE SHOULD NOT BELIEVE UTILITARIANISM THEN THE THEORY IS CERTAIN INCONSISTENT SOMEWHERE EITHER OF THESE OPTIONS WOULD BE CUTTING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE THEREFORE IT SEEMS AS IF CHANGING ONE'S BELIEFS ISN'T AN OPTION HERE

THE THIRD OPTION IS THE SAFEST BET BUT ISN'T EXACTLY ROSY IT ISN'T CLEAR TO ME WHAT BELIEVING IN UTILITARIANISM WITHOUT HAVING ANY OF THE ATTITUDES AMOUNTS TO IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WOULD REQUIRE A SAINTLY CAPACITY FOR DEFERRING TO MORAL AUTHORITY AGAINST ONE'S INCLINATIONS I WILL CONCEDE THIS IS AT LEAST POSSIBLE AND PERHAPS IT INDICATES AN EXTREME IDEAL WE SHOULD STRIVE TO IMITATE RATHER THAN PURSUE IN EARNEST THIS IS A FAIRLY SENSIBLE RESULT

HOWEVER EVEN BOUNDARY CASES CAN YIELD SOLUTIONS IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THIS CASE IS CONCEIVABLE IT SEEMS LIKE AT LEAST SOME OF THE DISPOSITIONS WE HOLD ARE ESSENTIAL FOR BELIEF LOSING ALL OR JUST A FEW IMPORTANT DISPOSITIONS AND STILL BELIEVING X MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE IF THIS IS THE CASE THEN THIS TURNS OUT TO BE AN INCOHERENT POSITION IF A MORE COHERENT ANALYSIS OF THIS CASE COULD BE PUT FORWARD THEN UTILITARIANISM IS IN BIG TROUBLE THEREFORE ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL ALTERNATIVE ETHICS THEORIES ARE SUPERIOR TO UTILITARIANISM IF THEY CAN RESPOND TO SELF REFERENCE CASES OR PROVIDE PRACTICE GUIDANCE TO THE UTILITARIAN IN THIS CASE

THIS TURNED OUT TO BE A MONSTER I'M GOING TO STOP HERE EDIT FOR READABILITY AND MAYBE WRITE A CLARIFICATION WHAT A MESS

EDIT FIXED SOME SPELLING MISTAKES
ON LIBERTY AND THE COMPANION WORKS EVOLVE UTILITARIANISM TO THE POINT OF WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER HUMANISM THE MOST EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT AND PERSONAL FORM OF FREEDOM UTILITY AND REVOLUTION ARE HIDDEN IN CULTURAL ARCHIVES CONTRIBUTING TO THE ARCHIVES IN A PERSONAL SOCIETAL AND INTERSTELLAR MANNER DEVELOPS THE WORLD FAR QUICKER AND CHEAPER THAN ANY OTHER PATHOLOGY

ABSTRACT

THIS PAPER GUIDES THE READER THROUGH THE USE OF FUNCTIONS IN CONTEMPORARY LEGAL PHILOSOPHY IN DEVELOPING THOSE PHILOSOPHIES AND THROUGH METHODOLOGICAL DEBATES OVER THEIR PROPER ROLE THIS PAPER IS BROKEN INTO TWO SECTIONS IN THE FIRST I CANVASS THE ROLE OF FUNCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PHILOSOPHIES OF SEVERAL MID TO LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY ANGLO-AMERICAN GENERAL JURISPRUDENT WHOSE THEORIES ARE STILL COMMON TOPICS OF DISCUSSION RONALD DWORKIN H LINE A HART LON LINE FULLER JOHN FINIS AND JOSEPH RAZ IN THE SECOND I EXAMINE CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTS OVER THE ROLE OF FUNCTIONS IN THE METHODOLOGY OF LEGAL PHILOSOPHY
DELETED
ACCORDING TO THIS ARTICLE DOES THIS MEAN THAT WHISTLEBLOWERS LIVING IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES REVEALING SECRETS THAT THREATEN THEIR SOCIETIES GOVERNMENTS AND STATUS QUOS YET ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN IN THE END SHOULD SUBMIT TO THE LAW EVEN IF THAT LAW ENDS UP SEVERELY PUNISHING THEM ALL FOR SOME ABSTRACT DEFERENCE FOR JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS

EDWARD SNOWDEN BEING THE FIRST PERSON THAT COMES TO MIND
TL R ANYONE
WELL WRITTEN ARTICLE
ATHENIANS COMMITMENT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE SPEECH INCLUDING THAT EVERY CITIZEN HAD AN EQUAL RIGHT TO SPEAK HIS MIND REMAINED RESOLUTE BUT ATHENIANS ALSO CONCEIVED OF SPEECH AS A FORM OF ACTION WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES CITIZENS HAD A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PUBLIC CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR PUBLIC ACTIONS AN ATHENIAN WHO SPOKE IN PUBLIC IN THE COUNCIL IN THE ASSEMBLY OR EVEN IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE COULD EXPECT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS SPEECH IF FOR EXAMPLE HE ADVOCATED A POLICY AND IT BROUGHT GOOD HE COULD EXPECT PRAISE AND HONOURS IF THE RESULTS OF HIS POLICY PROVED HARMFUL TO THE COMMUNITY S WELFARE HE MIGHT BE BLAMED AND PUNISHED ACCORDINGLY

PEOPLE SHOULD BE MADE TO READ THIS PASSAGE BEFORE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA
I WOULD ADD THAT THE JUDGEMENT OF DEATH TO SOCRATES ESSENTIALLY SECURED TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF FREEDOM FOR PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE OF HOW UNJUST THE TRIAL COMES OFFICIAL THAT'S A PRETTY INCREDIBLE FEAT AND I WOULD ARGUE HIS TRUE INTENTION IN ALLYING WITH PLATO
VERY INTERESTING WITH PRESENT DAY RELEVANCE
I ACTUALLY JUST LEARNED ABOUT THIS WHOLE TRIAL FROM MY UNDERSTANDING SOCRATES DEATH HAS BEEN COMPARED TO THE DEATH OF JESUS I FIND THIS VERY INTERESTING AND CAN SEE A LOT OF THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO THEY WERE EACH SEEN AS CORRUPTING SOCIETY THEY EACH SAID AND BELOVED THINGS THAT REALLY MADE ELITES MAD BECAUSE IT WENT AGAINST THE GRAIN AND MANY OTHER REASONS
I KNOW I'M NOT HITTING A LOT OF MAIN POINTS HERE BUT IN THE END THEY BOTH DIED WITH NO RESISTANCE THEY KNEW IT WAS IMPORTANT TO DIE BELIEVING IN WHAT THEY BELIEVED IN AND HAD BEEN ADVOCATING THEIR WHOLE LIVES IN ORDER FOR THEIR IDEAS TO SURVIVE WELL AFTER THEIR DEATH
ALSO I LEARNED THAT AFTER SOCRATES HAD DRANK THE POISON HE HAD ALL OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN LEAVE SO THEY WOULDN'T BE CRYING OR HAVE TO SEE HIS DEATH HOWEVER ALL OF THE MEN THAT REMAINED INCLUDING PLATO AND MANY OTHER MEN STARTED CRYING AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE PAINTING WHEN THEY STARTED DOING THAT SOCRATES WAS LIKE FOAH WHAT ARE YOU DOING I SENT ALL THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN AWAY SO THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN I FOUND THAT PART TO BE KIND OF FUNNY AND ALSO IT SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT SOCRATES WAS TO ALL OF THESE LIKE MINDED PEOPLE IN THE ROOM WITH HIM DURING HIS DEATH




AH IT SEEMS YOU ARE RIGHT THANKS EITHER WAY IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING TOPIC THAT HAS REALLY TAKEN ME IN
HE WAS ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ENDED UP BEING INSTALLED TO RULE ATHENS BY THE SPARTANS THE TYRANTS AND HAD PRESUMABLY AGITATED AGAINST DEMOCRACY WITH THEM BASICALLY SOCRATES WAS THE PATRON PHILOSOPHER OF A GROUP OF NAZI CAPOS AND WAS FRIENDLY WITH THEM WHILE THEY COMMITTED THEIR WORST CRIMES AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE

HIS REPUTATION WOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IF HE HADN'T DONE EXACTLY WHAT HE DID
IT'S AMAZING THAT WE ARE STILL ARGUING ABOUT THIS YEARS LATER I REMEMBER AS A CHILD WHEN PEOPLE WERE ARGUING ABOUT THIS
GOOD ARTICLE THOUGH I FOUND THE CONCLUSION GLIB AND PANDERING
DELETED
SO IN SHORT PEOPLE IN OUR MODERN AGE THAT ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE WAY THEY ARE TREATED UNDER THE LAW FOR THINGS THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE DONE SHOULD TAKE A PAGE FROM AND SUCK IT UP

I CAN AGREE WITH THAT

IF YOU DID SOMETHING BAD THEN YOU DESERVE WHAT YOU GET
2 IF YOU DIDN'T THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR
A GREAT OVERVIEW AND I AGREE WITH ALMOST ALL OF THE INTUITIONS IT DESCRIBES LOOKING OVER THE REST OF THE SITE HOWEVER I AM ASTONISHED THAT THERE IS NO MENTION WHATSOEVER OF ANTINATURALISM THE INESCAPABLE CONCLUSION OF ETHICS ESPECIALLY IF THEY INCORPORATE OR NEGATIVE PREFERENCE UTILITARIANISM IS THAT WE OUGHT NOT BRING NEW PEOPLE INTO EXISTENCE INDEED THIS IS THE ONE BEHAVIOR THAT IF FOLLOWED BY EVERYONE WOULD COMPLETELY FULFILL THE STATED MISSION OF THEIR INSTITUTE TO BEST REDUCE THE SUFFERING OF SENTIENT BEINGS IN THE NEAR AND FAR FUTURE WE PUBLISH ESSAYS AND ACADEMIC ARTICLES AND ADVISE INDIVIDUALS AND POLICYMAKERS OUR FOCUS IS ON EXPLORING EFFECTIVE ROBUST AND COOPERATIVE STRATEGIES TO AVOID RISKS OF DYSTOPIAN FUTURES IF NO NEW PEOPLE WERE BORN THERE WOULD BE NO SUFFERING WHATSOEVER AND ACCEPTING THE INTUITIONS LAID OUT IN THE PAGE YOU LINKED THE FACT THAT SENTIENT BEINGS WERE PREVENTED FROM EXISTING WOULD NOT BE A DOWNSIDE SINCE THERE WOULD BE NOBODY WORSE OFF AS A RESULT
THE ROOT OF SUFFERING IS UNFULFILLED NEEDS THE REST IS MUCH SIMPLER TO HANDLE ACCORDING TO PSYCHOLOGISTS PHILOSOPHERS AND THE CREATIVE BEERS
LOOKS GOOD

TWO SMART GUYS TO BE SURE
I THINK THE MOST USEFUL MEASURE FOR CHINESE ROOM DEBATES IS TO AVOID COMPLETELY ABSTRACTING AWAY THE ROOM ITSELF ITS RULES AND HOW IT CAME INTO EXISTENCE THERE ARE VERSIONS OF THE ROOM SUCH THAT I'D AGREE THAT THE ROOM ISN'T UNDERSTANDING CHINESE BUT THERE ARE VERSIONS THAT I THINK DO AND IT VERY MUCH DEPENDS ON WHAT THE RULES GOVERNING THE ROOM ACTUALLY ARE IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM READING THIS DENNETT AND SEARLE DISAGREE ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THE RULES MUCH MORE THAN THE ACTUAL PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS
I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THE TWO SIDES OF THIS ARGUMENT HAVE BEEN TALKING PAST EACH OTHER SINCE THE MOST AI PEOPLE FIND THE SYSTEM ARGUMENT COMPELLING BECAUSE THEY ARE ARGUING AGAINST A OF SEARLE SEARLE IS PARTLY TO BLAME FOR THIS MISUNDERSTANDING HE HAS HAD YEARS TO CLEAR UP THE CONFUSION BUT TOO OFTEN REVERTS TO USING THE TERM SEMANTICS WHICH SADLY HAS VERY CLEAR MEANING ON THE COMPUTER SCIENCE SIDE AND A LESS CLEAR MEANING ON THE PHILOSOPHICAL SIDE

MAIN ARGUMENT IS THAT UNDERSTANDING HAS A FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE THE ROOM DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE THE SYSTEMS REPLY DOES NOT ADDRESS THIS LACKING FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE STRONG AI PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR JOHN MCCARTHY AND ED FEIGENBAUM WHEN ASKED ABOUT HOW THEY INTEND TO GENERATE THIS FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE SAY THAT THIS IS AN OPEN PROBLEM THAT WILL NEED TO BE SOLVED

THE DISAGREEMENT IS A CLASH OF INTUITIONS SEARLE DOES NOT SEE HOW FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE CAN BE MADE OUT OF ARBITRARY PARTS HE KNOWS THAT MEAT CAN MAKE FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE BUT DOES NOT SEE WHY THIS SHOULD GENERALIZE TO OTHER SUBSTANCES STRONG AI PEOPLE DO NOT SEE WHY MEAT SHOULD BE SPECIAL IN ANY WAY SO PRESUME THAT FIRST PERSON EXPERIENCE CAN BE MADE OUT OF ARBITRARY PARTS


IT SEEMS LIKE SEARLE IS JUST PLAIN WRONG ABOUT THIS HE IS DENYING THAT THE SUPERSYSTEM CAN UNDERSTAND IN EXACTLY THE WAY THAT DENNETT CLAIMS

SEARLE SEEMS TO BE CLAIMING THAT SUBSYSTEMS CAN HAVE SYNTAX BUT THE SUPERSYSTEM CANNOT HAVE SEMANTICS HE CLAIMS THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO SHOW OTHERWISE IS ON DENNETT AND THAT NO ONE CAN OR WILL BE ABLE TO DO THIS BUT IF WE THINK OF OUR BRAINS AS SUPERSYSTEMS THEN WE HAVE AT LEAST ONE EXAMPLE WHERE THE SUPERSYSTEM HAS SEMANTICS WHILE THE SUBSYSTEMS MERELY HAVE SYNTAX FURTHER SEARLE DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY REASON THAT THIS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR AI OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT HE CANNOT IMAGINE IT BEING POSSIBLE

IT SEEMS LIKE SEARLE IS JUST STICKING HIS FINGERS IN HIS EARS AND YELLING THAT HE IS RIGHT WHILE IGNORING ALL EVIDENCE THAT HE IS WRONG
AND HERE IN THERE IS STILL NO SUCH ACTUAL THING AS STRONG AI
FOR ANYONE WITH AN INTEREST IN SOCRATIC PLATONIC MORAL INTELLECTUALISM AND THE VIEW THAT KNOWLEDGE IS EITHER SUFFICIENT OR NECESSARY FOR VIRTUE AND I KNOW THAT'S EACH AND EVERYONE OF ESSAY INCLUDES SOME NOTEWORTHY
KNOWLEDGE IS FLUID LEARN FROM THE PAST FOR THE FUTURE ABSORB IDEAS AND KNOWLEDGE UNTIL THE GRASP IS GOOD ENOUGH TO EVOLVE ONES THINKING AND STANCE FREEDOM IN THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE ALLOWS FOR UNBRIDLED GENIUS RESTRICTIONS PUT IN PLACE TO OSTRACIZE OR ISOLATE INDIVIDUALS DOES NOT REMOVE THE FUNDAMENTAL DESPAIR ASSOCIATED WITH CAGES AND PARALYSIS

IF WE LIVE IN CAGES OF OUR OWN MAKING ARE WE STILL FREE IF OUR MIND IS THE ONLY CAGE WE HAVE CONTROL OF HOW DO WE EXTRACT OURSELVES FROM THE IMPENETRABLE PRISONS WE CREATE FOR OURSELVES

PURSUE DREAMS OF OUR OWN MAKING AND FOR OUR PASSIONS SUDDENLY ONE MAY FEEL ALIVE AND HAPPY BY DISSOLVING THE BARRIER BETWEEN CONSCIENCE THOUGHT AND PHYSICAL REALITY METAPHYSICAL NATURE EXISTS ENLIGHTEN RENAISSANCE CREATE AND INSPIRE IF POSSIBLE THE ONE LIMIT IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE IMAGINATION
THE THRUST OF THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT ECONOMIC LIBERALISM IS THE BEST WAY TO SATISFY THE RAWLSIAN PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE OK FINE FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT LET'S SAY THAT THAT POLICY DECISION TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE THE AUTHOR MOVES TO SET UP A DICHOTOMY BETWEEN HAYEK AND RAWLS WHERE HAYEK ADVOCATES THIS LIBERALISM AND RAWLS DOESN'T THE PIECE TRIES TO PAINT RAWLS INTO A CORNER WHERE HE CAN'T LABEL HIM AS ADHERING TO A PARTICULAR SET OF MEANS TO FORM A JUST SOCIETY TO TURN RAWLS INTO A POLICY WONK IS TO COMPLETELY MISS THE POINT OF THE RAWLSIAN MODEL THIS PIECE COMES OFF AS JUST AN ATTEMPT TO ADVOCATE MARKET LIBERALISM UNDER A VEIL OF AND THROWS IN SOME HEAVY HANDED SLEIGHTS TOWARDS POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AND THE BOGEY MAN THAT IS CULTURAL MARXISM TO LET THE READER KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR ISN'T TRYING TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE RAWLS OR POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AT ALL
CULTURAL MARXISM IS NOT A THING

THIS THESIS IS PRETTY HARD TO DISCERN ALL THE STUFF ABOUT THE PARALYMPICS IS BASICALLY A RED HERRING OR POINTLESS POSTURING BEFORE GETTING TO THE POINT OR HALF OF AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE POINT WITHOUT THE OTHER HALF ANYWHERE THE IDEA SEEMS TO BE THAT LETTING PEOPLE DO MORE OR LESS WHATEVER THEY WANT TURNS OUT TO THE BENEFIT OF THE LEAST WELL OFFICIAL THAT STRIKES ME AS CLEARLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY FALSE BUT EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR RAWLS RAWLS SIMPLY SAYS THAT THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY OUGHT TO BE ARRANGED SUCH THAT IT SATISFIES THE TWO PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE IF GIVING PEOPLE FREEDOM TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT GIVES THAT RESULT THEN WE GIVE PEOPLE FREEDOM TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT THE END

BOOK DESCRIPTION

THIS BOOK SEEKS TO CONTRIBUTE TO A LEGAL POSITIVIST PICTURE OF LAW BY DEFENDING TWO METAPHYSICAL CLAIMS ABOUT LAW AND INVESTIGATING THEIR METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS ONE CLAIM IS THAT THE LAW IS A KIND OF ARTIFACT A THOROUGHGOING HUMAN CREATION FOR PERFORMING CERTAIN TASKS OR ACCOMPLISHING CERTAIN GOALS THAT IS ARTIFACTS ARE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THEIR FUNCTIONS WHEN DISCUSSING ARTIFACTS THE NOTION OF FUNCTION NEED NOT BE AS MYSTERIOUS OR PROBLEMATIC AS MIGHT BE THE CASE WITH BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS THE OTHER CLAIM IS THAT THE LAW IS AN INSTITUTION A SPECIFIC KIND OF ARTIFACT THAT CREATES ARTIFICIAL ROLES WHICH ALLOW FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MANIPULATION OF RIGHTS AND DUTIES AMONG THOSE SUBJECT TO THE INSTITUTION THE METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATION OF THIS PICTURE OF LAW IS THAT IT IS BEST UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONS THAT IT PERFORMS AND THAT THE JOB OF THE LEGAL PHILOSOPHER IS TO INVESTIGATE THOSE FUNCTIONS THIS POSITION IS ADVANCED AGAINST THEORIES OF LAW THAT NONETHELESS RELY UPON NOTIONS OF LAW S FUNCTION AND IS ALSO ADVANCED AGAINST POSITIVIST PICTURES THAT TEND TO DE-EMPHASIZE OR OVERLOOK THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT FUNCTION MUST PLAY TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF LAW ONE KEY IMPLICATION OF THIS PICTURE IS THAT IT CAN HELP EXPLAIN HOW LAW MIGHT GIVE PEOPLE REASONS TO ACT BEYOND ITS USE OF FORCE TO DO SO
HERE'S THE FIRST PARAGRAPH AS A SUMMARY OF THE PAPER

DISABILITY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS OFTEN CLAIM THAT BEING DISABLED ISN T SOMETHING THAT S BAD FOR YOU
DISABILITY IS RATHER A NATURAL PART OF HUMAN DIVERSITY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE VALUED AND
CELEBRATED RATHER THAN PITIED AND ULTIMATELY CURED BUT THOUGH THIS VIEW IS COMMON AMONG
DISABILITY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS MANY PERHAPS MOST PHILOSOPHERS FIND IT IMPLAUSIBLE AND RADICAL A MAJOR
OBJECTION TO SUCH VIEWS OF DISABILITY ONE WHICH TRIES TO REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT THE POSITION IS
DEEPLY IMPLAUSIBLE IS THIS WERE THEY CORRECT THEY WOULD MAKE IT PERMISSIBLE TO CAUSE DISABILITY
AND FOR SIMILAR REASONS IMPERMISSIBLE TO CAUSE OR IMPERMISSIBLE TO CURE DISABILITY
TO USE THE TERM THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO SHOW THAT THESE TWIN OBJECTIONS DON T
SUCCEED WE CAN APPEAL TO NEITHER THE PERMISSIBILITY OF CAUSING DISABILITY NOR THE IMPERMISSIBILITY OF
CAUSING TO UNDERMINE THE POSITION

IF ONE DOESN'T LIKE THE TYPESETTING ON THIS DOCUMENT THERE'S A NEATER VERSION ON ASTOR FOR THOSE WITH ACCESS

EDIT FOR AN ALTERNATIVE SOMEWHAT LONGER SUMMARY OF THE PAPER AND THE ARGUMENTS THEREIN SEE THIS SHORT REVIEW OF IT BY TOM DOUGHERTY THAT PAGE ALSO CONTAINS SOME DISCUSSION OF THE PAPER BY SOME PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY YOU HEARD FOR THE CURE IS SO THE CORPORATIONS GIVING MONEY TO THESE CAUSES CAN CLAIM THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING THAT'S POSSIBLY NOT FEASIBLE AT ALL TO BEGIN WITH WHICH MEANS IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY TO INVEST IN INTENTIONALLY SO THE BUSINESS CAN MAKE A PROFIT THIS WAS AND STILL IS VERY WIDESPREAD WITH THE BREAST CANCER FOUNDATION KOHEN

UNFORTUNATELY THIS ARTICLE WON'T LEAD TO CHANGES BECAUSE THIS IS A LEGAL ISSUE THIS IS AN ETHICS ISSUE

THERE NEEDS TO BE A BILL THAT MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR COMPANIES TO PROFIT OFF OF DISEASE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S ADS TRADEMARKS MEDICINE WHEN SOMETHING IS LITERALLY PART OF YOUR HUMAN RIGHTS IT IS NOT UP FOR SALE MAYBE THE GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE SHOULD START RECOGNIZING THAT WE'RE BEING ABUSED AND MANIPULATED BY BOTH THEM AND CORPORATIONS FOR CORPORATE PROFIT
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

THIS SUB IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TANGENTIAL ANECDOTES OR DANK MEMES EXPECT COMMENT THREADS THAT BREAK OUR RULES TO BE REMOVED
HE ALSO HAS TWO COURSES ON COURSER EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM AND PRACTICAL ETHICS TO BE RELEASED


I TOOK PROFESSOR BIOETHICS COURSE PRINCETON IT WAS CALLED PRACTICAL ETHICS ONE OF THE MOST ILLUMINATING CONTROVERSIAL COURSES OFFERED

THE TRUTH IS THOUGH OF THE CONTROVERSY IS STIRRED BY A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF HIS THESES

HE A UTILITARIAN SO HE FRAMES EVERYTHING AS NET GOOD VS NET EVIL

HE'S ALSO A PRAGMATIST WHO DRAWS THE LINE AROUND SHELLFISH FOR SENTIENCE IN TERMS OF INTRINSIC VALUE THINGS WE ARE ALLOWED TO EAT VS NOT

COMBINE THESE TWO IT'S NOT SO FAR FETCHED THAT HE SPECULATE INFANTICIDE EUTHANIZATION OF SEVERELY DISABLED PEOPLE A BEING WHO IS SEVERELY RETARDED IN SEVERE PAIN NOT SELF AWARE AND FUTURE IS HIGHLY PROBABILITY OF INCREASE NET SUFFERING OF THE WORLD HARD LIFE ON CHILD PARENTS ETC

ALONG THESE LINES ARGUMENTS FOR INFANTICIDE FOR EXAMPLE ARE DESIGNED TO END IMMENSE SUFFERING SPINA BIFIDA FOR EXAMPLE AS MORALLY ACCEPTABLE INSTANCES OF INFANTICIDE OR SOMEONE WHO IS SEVERELY RETARDED THAT THE PARENTS ARE NOT IN CONDITION TO CARE FOR

THERE ARE GRAY LINES RIGHT AND WRONG ARE NOT CLEAR IN ETHICS AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHY IT'S FASCINATING HE PUSHES THE BOUNDARY OF OUR OWN BELIEFS MAKES US QUESTION OUR OWN UNDERSTAND OF ETHICS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PART IS HIS ABILITY TO DO THIS A WAY EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND AND HAVE AN OPINION

EDIT RIGHT ALSO PLEASE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD EUTHANIZE MILDLY MEDICAL CASES I BELIEVE CONUNDRUM EXISTS ONLY IN SEVERE CASES
REMOVED
READ ONE OF HIS ESSAYS FROM NORTON READER IN HIGH SCHOOL HIS RHETORIC IS REALLY DOWN-TO-EARTH BUT STILL POINTS OUT THE CONTRADICTIONS OF HUMAN MORALITY VERY WELL A BIZARRE BUT EFFECTIVE PHILOSOPHER
MET THE PROFESSOR ONCE IN MELBOURNE THE MOST HUMBLE AND DOWN-TO-EARTH GUY YOU COULD FIND
DESPITE THEIR BREVITY THE ESSAYS DO NOT SHIRK THE BIG MORAL QUESTIONS INCLUDING PERHAPS THE BIGGEST OF ALL CAN THERE BE OBJECTIVELY TRUE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION OF HOW ONE OUGHT TO ACT IN A PIECE ABOUT ON WHAT MATTERS BY DEREK PARFAIT A PHILOSOPHER MR SINGER DISTILS MORE THAN PAGES OF ARGUMENT DOWN TO A SCANT THREE AND CONCURS WITH HIM THAT MORAL JUDGMENTS CAN INDEED BE TRUE OR FALSE

OH BOY I'M AWFULLY CURIOUS ABOUT THIS
SEEMS LIKE MODS ARE JUST REMOVING ANYTHING THAT'S NOT POSITIVE IN SUPPORT OF SINGER THE TOP COMMENTS AREN'T IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE CONTENT OF THE ESSAYS NOR COULD ANY REAL DISCUSSION BE HAD ON THE CONTENT OF A BUNCH OF ESSAYS IN THE SAME THREAD THAT THEY'RE POSTED THIS POST IS A GENERAL HERE'S A BODY OF A PHILOSOPHER'S WORK DISCUSS

STOP CENSORING AND CONTROLLING THE PEOPLE DISCUSS HOW THEY WANT

STOP DELETING COMMENTS
SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT PETER SINGER THAT DUDE CAN BITE THE FUCK OUT OF A BULLET

REMOVED
HIGHLY RECOMMEND READING ANIMAL LIBERATION
ALRIGHT GOOD STUFF

I JUST READ THE INTRO TO THE BOOK AFTER READING THIS COMMENT THREAD AND READING ABOUT THE DISABLED WOMEN WHO SO BRAVELY MET THE AUTHOR HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TERMINATED AS A BABY AND THE LIKE THE AUTHOR IS RIGHT IN HIS THINKING ON CERTAIN MATTERS FOR SURE QUESTIONING STATUS QUO ETC BUT HIS ATHEISTIC PONTIFICATIONS ARE IN NEED OF A CHALLENGE AS ALL HIS PREVIOUS APOLOGETIC CONVERSATIONS HE STRIKES DOWN WITH EASE HIS ACCOUNT NOT MINE I'LL SUM UP MY THOUGHTS HERE FOR NOW BUT DON'T MIND GOING IN FURTHER IF YOU PM ME

IN REGARDS TO THE CHAPTER IN THE AUTHORS BOOK GOD AND SUFFERING AGAIN
I ASSUME THAT AS REDDITORS YOU'VE PROBABLY ALL SEEN THE NETFLIX SHOW STRANGER THINGS IF YOU HAVEN'T THE ANALOGOUS SECTION TO ADAM AND EVE AND THUS THE AFTERMATH OF SIN COULD GO LIKE THIS IN STRANGER THINGS A GOVERNMENT ENTITY LEARNS OF A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAS TELEPATHIC SPECIAL POWERS THAT THEY CAN EXACERBATE THROUGH DEPRIVATION TANK APPARATUSES THESE ALLOW HER TO ACCESS A KIND OF LAYER OF REALITY THAT SHE CAN THEN FIND OUT INFORMATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TOP SECRET BENEFIT THEY PUSH HER TOO FAR AND AS A RESULT SHE DISCOVERS A DEMONIC LOOKING CREATURE IN THE MIDDLE SPACE BETWEEN OUR REALITY AND ITS SHE BECOMES AFRAID AND HER INTUITION IS TO STOP DOING THE WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT BUT THEY PRESS HER TO KEEP GATHERING INTEL IN THIS MIDDLE SPACE ON HER NEXT TRIP NOT ONLY DOES SHE FIND THE DEMON LIKE CREATURE BUT IT FINDS A PORTAL INTO OUR WORLD WORLD BECAUSE OF THEIR MEETING
NOW WHEN GOD CREATED THE WORLD IT WAS PERFECT AND HE SAID DON'T EAT THE APPLE WHICH COULD BE ANALOGOUS TO THE GIRLS INTUITION THAT SHE SHOULDN'T BE MESSING AROUND IN THIS EXACERBATED MIDDLE PLACE WITH THE SCARY DEMON ONCE THE DEMON OPENED THAT PORTAL IT WAS FOREVER OPENED HE IT WAS NOW ABLE TO OPEN PORTALS ANYWHERE WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO LIFE AFTER THE FALL FOR OUR STRUGGLE IS NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD BUT AGAINST THE RULERS AGAINST THE AUTHORITIES AGAINST THE POWERS OF THIS DARK WORLD AND AGAINST THE SPIRITUAL FORCES OF EVIL IN THE HEAVENLY REALMS EPHESIANS THAT'S WHY THEIR IS SUFFERING

WHY WOULD GOD ALLOW THIS IF HE IS ALL POWERFUL AND LET'S THROW IN ALL GOOD AND PERFECT FOR GOOD MEASURE ITS ANOTHER QUESTION WITH ANOTHER ANALOGY OR SHALL I DARE SAY A PARABLE

I LEARNED ON REDDIN TODAY THAT SOME OF THE MOST BASIC EARLY TRANSISTORS WERE VACUUM TUBES ACHIEVED THEIR BASIC TRANSISTOR LIKE FUNCTION THROUGH INTRODUCING A CURRENT OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH A VACUUM APPARATUS TO CHANGE THE MAGNETISM OR OF IONS OR ELECTRONS OR SOMETHING MAGICAL NOT SURE THAT WOULD THEN COMPLETE A CLOSED PATHOLOGY THIS THEN GAVE THE SIGN TO A OBSERVER OR COMPUTER THAT THE TRANSISTOR IS ON
THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT IS ANALOGOUS TO PAIN MORE OVERARCHING THOUGH WOULD BE THE DRAMA OF JESUS REDEEMING POWER TO MAKE RIGHT THE EARTHLINGS WHO DISOBEYED GODS INSTRUCTIONS WE THE EARTHLINGS AND FOR THAT MATTER ALL THAT EXISTS INSIDE THIS APPARATUS INCLUDING THE ANIMALS PLANTS STARS AND SO FORTH ARE THE IONS

THE BIG PICTURE IN ITS MOST BASIC FORM IS THAT GOD HAS CREATED AND IN OUR TIME SCALE IS IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A CIRCUIT OR TRANSISTOR THAT IS COMPLETE AND IS CLOSED PROTECTED FROM DEATH OR THE UPSIDE DOWN PLACE FROM THE NETFLIX SHOW AND IS AS IMMACULATE AS THE TRANSISTORS CAPACITY TO HANDLE CURRENT BEFORE BREAKING HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING
SO THAT'S A GOOD GOD WHO MAINTAINS PERFECTION WHILE ALSO STRUTS HIS CAPACITY TO CREATE AWESOME LITERAL MEANING OF THE WORD TRANSISTORS
I DON'T KNOW A TON ABOUT ETHICS OR THE AUTHOR BUT IN THE END AS LONG AS WE WORK ON FIGURING OUT WHAT OUR SUBJECTIVE OBJECTIVE MORAL JUDGMENTS ARE AND ACTUATING THEM THEN WE ARE ALL CLIMBING THE SAME MOUNTAIN JUST DIFFERENT SIDES AND SO I TELL YOU EVERY KIND OF SIN AND SLANDER CAN BE FORGIVEN BUT BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE SPIRIT WILL NOT BE FORGIVEN MATHEW SO KEEP CLIMBING

LASTLY THE TRANSISTOR CONCEPT IS INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE IT REFLECTS SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOOTING AROUND ABOUT HOW WE ARE IN A SIMULATION THE BEST THING THAT COMES FROM THAT IDEA IS THAT OUR SOULS PROGRAM COULD BE INTO A SIM THAT'S DESIGNED IN AND FOR A HIGHER DIMENSION AKA HEAVEN
FROM EQUALITY FOR ANIMALS
HOW CAN ANYONE WASTE THEIR TIME ON EQUALITY FOR ANIMALS WHEN SO MANY HUMANS ARE DENIED REAL EQUALITY THIS ATTITUDE REFLECTS A POPULAR PREJUDICE AGAINST TAKING THE INTERESTS OF ANIMALS SERIOUSLY A PREJUDICE NO BETTER FOUNDED THAN THE PREJUDICE OF WHITE SLAVEOWNER AGAINST TAKING THE INTERESTS OF BLACKS SERIOUSLY

ETHICS INCLUDE EQUATING HUMAN LIFE WITH ANIMAL LIFE SEEING NO GREATER SIGNIFICANCE IN A HUMAN LIFE THAN THAT OF AN ANIMAL'S BESIDES THE SUFFERING A LOVED ONES MAY FEEL IF THEY WERE GONE THIS IS OFFENSIVE

ALSO OFFENSIVE IS THE NOTION THAT ANIMALS IN BONDAGE IS AN EVIL ON PAR WITH THAT OF HOLDING BLACKS AS SLAVES NO A FARM ANIMAL IS NOT MORALLY EQUIVALENT TO A HUMAN AND TRYING TO PHILOSOPHIZE THIS IDEA SHOULD BE TAKEN ABOUT AS SERIOUSLY AS PONDERING EUGENICS WHICH NOT SURPRISINGLY IS A SIMILARITY GERMANS HAVE NOTICED AND HAS MADE HIM NOT VERY POPULAR ON THEIR SOIL

SINGER DISGUSTS ME AND I'M EVEN MORE DISGUSTED THAT HIS WRITINGS ARE TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN FOUNDATION COURSES AT MANY COLLEGES

I LOVE THIS SERIES AND HAVE ENJOYED EVERY PART UP UNTIL THIS ONE

I HATE THIS EPISODE

THEY NEVER REALLY DEFINE HARM IF YOU OFFEND SOMEONE HOW HAVE YOU HARMED THEM IS BEING OFFENDED THE SAME THING AS BEING HARMED

2 THE NARRATOR REPEATEDLY MENTIONS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPEAKER MEANING AND AUDIENCE UNDERSTANDING BUT FAILS TO APPLY IT TO THIS SITUATION AS LONG AS THE AUDIENCE UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU ARE NOT BEING INTENTIONALLY INSULTING IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WORDS YOU USE IF THE AUDIENCE IS BOUND AND DETERMINED TO TAKE OFFENSE AT EVERY SINGLE UTTERANCE YOU MAKE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WORDS YOU USE

THE IDEA THAT CERTAIN WORDS HAVE MEANING BAKED IN THAT CANNOT BE UNBAKED IS INCREDIBLY LAZY GIVEN TIME AND EFFORT WORDS CAN TAKE ENTIRELY NEW MEANINGS AS POINTED OUT BY PREVIOUS EPISODES EVEN TERRIBLE WORDS SUCH AS OR CAN BE TURNED INTO WORDS WITH NEW MEANINGS GIVEN A CONCERTED EFFORT AMONG SPEAKERS

I REALLY REALLY DON'T GET THE BABY EXAMPLE ISN'T THE REASON BABY IS A TERM OF ENDEARMENT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE PAMPERING THEM CARING FOR THEM LOVING THEM AS IF THEY WERE LITERALLY YOUR BABY I WILL MAKE YOU FEEL SAFE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE WEAK OR SICK OR VULNERABLE IS PART OF WHAT MAKES IT A TERM OF ENDEARMENT

CONTINUING WITH THE BABY THING EXCEPT FOR THE TROUBLEMAKER AND WINNER EXAMPLES PEOPLE DON'T TEND TO CHANGE AT LEAST NOT QUICKLY IF SOMEONE DID SOMETHING THAT CAUSED YOU TO EVEN THINK THEY WERE A TROUBLEMAKER ODDS ARE THEY WILL DO SO AGAIN THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WORDS YOU END UP UTTERING SAME WITH WINNER BLAMING THE WORDS SEEMS TO IGNORE THAT PERSONS PAST HISTORY

IN SHORT WORDS CAN DO HARM THE WORDS IN A LEGAL CONTRACT CAN COST GREAT DEALS OF MONEY THE WORDS IN THE LAW CAN PREVENT OR INFLICT GREAT PHYSICAL HARM WORDS CAN EVEN MARRY AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY ON THIS SERIES HOWEVER I DON'T SEE WHAT THIS EPISODE IS REALLY ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE SORRY CRASH COURSE IS STILL GOOD JUST DO BETTER NEXT TIME
I DON'T QUIET UNDERSTAND THE PART OF THE VIDEO ABOUT HATE SPEECH THE LAWYER ARGUES THAT WORDS LIKE FAGGOT CONSTITUTE HATE SPEECH AND SHOULDN'T BE PROTECTED BECAUSE THEY BUNDLE ESSENTIAL SELF IDENTITY WITH NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS BUT THEN WOULDN'T THE STATEMENT GAY PEOPLE ARE EVIL WRONG DISGUSTING ALSO BE HATE SPEECH IT TOO TAKES WHAT IS IN THIS VIDEO STATED TO BE AN ESSENTIAL SELF IDENTITY AND DECLARES IT NEGATIVE SO WHY IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOING SO WITH WORD VS
HAS ANYONE EVER INVESTIGATED BIGOTED SLURS AS SPEECH ACTS SPEECH ACTS ARE UTTERANCES THAT DO MORE THAN WHAT WE EXPECT FROM THE DESCRIPTIVE EXPRESSIVE USES OF LANGUAGE AN EXAMPLE OF A SPEECH ACT IS SAYING I DO IN A WEDDING CEREMONY
ESSAYS AND REVIEWS ARE SOME OF THE BEST I'M SURPRISED BY THE RELATIVELY ELEMENTARY MISTAKES THE AUTHOR REVIEWED SUPPOSEDLY MADE AS THEY'RE PRETTY COMMON ONES AND SO CORRECTED QUITE OFTEN TOO NAGEL ELUCIDATES THE MISTAKES AND CORRECTIONS RATHER WELL
CAN WE PLEASE NOT USE RAPE AS A STANDARD EXAMPLE

IF SOME POOR DOG HAS LOST ITS LEG YOU ARE NOT CLAIMING THAT THIS ANIMAL IS NO LONGER A DOG YOU ARE CLAIMING THAT SOME CHARACTERISTIC HISTORICAL FEATURE OF DOGS IS MISSING THE SAME GOES FOR THE NO TRUE SCOTSMAN IS A SEX MANIAC EXAMPLE

WITH THE SCOTSMAN EXAMPLE YOU ARE SOCIALLY DISTANCING YOURSELF FROM A FELLOW SCOT WHO HAS DONE A THING OF WHICH YOU DISAPPROVE YOU WOULDN'T SAY OF A TRIPOD WELL IT'S NOT A TRUE DOG

BUT YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE THE REACTION IF TRIED TO HAVE CELEBRATIONS FESTIVALS PARADES OR HOLIDAYS

BECAUSE IT'S CODE FOR HISTORICALLY WHITE PEOPLE THINGS SPECIFIC TO WHITE PEOPLE IN THE US TEND TO BE ABOUT OPPRESSING PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WHITE IF YOU SPEAK ABOUT A SPECIFIC ETHNICITY FROM EUROPE ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT'S SPECIFIC TO IT A COMMON LANGUAGE LIKE BASQUE OR CATALAN OR WELSH WHICH IS SOMETHING EUROPE AS A WHOLE NEVER HAD ATTIRE HOLIDAYS FOODS THAT KIND OF THING

THE PRIMARY COMMONALITY WITHIN EUROPE IS CHRISTIANITY NOT AN ETHNICITY AND NOBODY COMPLAINS ABOUT CHRISTIANITY CENTERS OR FESTIVALS THERE ARE SOME PLACES WITH A CHRISTIANITY CENTER FOR EVERY COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND CHRISTIANITY CAMP IS PRETTY POPULAR IN A LOT OF AREAS CHRISTIANITY ISN'T CONSTRAINED TO PEOPLE OF EUROPEAN EXTRACT IT SPREAD IN VARIOUS FORMS THROUGHOUT THE ROMAN EMPIRE BACK WHEN THAT WAS A THING AND IN THE EIGHTEEN CENTURIES SINCE IT'S SPREAD TO PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE AND IT STARTED IN THE MIDDLE EAST ANYWAY
I WOULD SAY THE CITIZENRY OF ANY FREE SOCIETY MUST HAVE GENERALLY INFORMED CITIZENS NOT ONLY IN PHILOSOPHY BUT BASIC MATHS RELIGION AND SCIENCE THE MORE EDUCATION THE BETTER IS MY PHILOSOPHY WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS IT'S LIKE BUYING A NEW PRODUCT YOU MUST BE AN INFORMED CONSUMER IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MOST OPTIMAL CHOICES RELATIVE TO YOUR LIFE SITUATION

IS TRUTH ITSELF NATURAL THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR BOTH THOSE WORKING ON TRUTH AND THOSE WORKING ON NATURALISM FOR THEORISTS OF TRUTH ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TRUTH IS NATURAL WILL TELL US MORE ABOUT THE NATURE OF TRUTH OR LACK OF IT AND THE RELATIONS BETWEEN TRUTH AND OTHER PROPERTIES OF INTEREST FOR THOSE WORKING ON NATURALISM ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO THOSE WHO WISH TO HAVE TRUTH AS PART OF THEIR NATURAL ORDER IN THIS PAPER WE FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE KINDS OF THEORIES OF TRUTH THAT OCCUPY THE CENTRAL POSITIONS IN CURRENT DEBATES ABOUT TRUTH NAMELY CORRESPONDENCE THEORIES DEFLATIONARY THEORIES EPISTEMIC THEORIES AND PLURALIST THEORIES AND AIM TO DISCERN THE EXTENT TO WHICH TRUTH IS A NATURAL PROPERTY ON EACH VIEW

THE PAPERS ARE LISTED INDIVIDUALLY HERE

AWESOME THANKS A LOT FOR THE LINK
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE ABOUT HOW I CAN DOWNLOAD THIS INTO MY BRAIN
AH YOU ARE AWESOME THANK YOU
WOW AWESOME SHARE THANKS SO MUCH
KATCHINA EVERS HAS A REALLY GOOD PIECE IN THIS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ANYBODY READ SOME PIECES AND HAS SOME FEEDBACK
LOOKS INTERESTING
TL R BRAINS AND THINKING AND STUFF
GREAT COLLECTION OF PAPERS FROM DIVERSE SCHOOLS I LOOK FORWARD TO READING THESE

MY FIRST THOUGHT READING IS SHOULD THIS SUB APPLY RULES AS DESCRIBED BY DENNETT AND LISTED IN QUALIA EXPLAINED AWAY BY DAVID BLASTER

YOU SHOULD ATTEMPT TO RE-EXPRESS YOUR TARGET S POSITION SO
CLEARLY VIVIDLY AND FAIRLY THAT YOUR TARGET SAYS THANKS I WISH I D
THOUGHT OF PUTTING IT THAT WAY
2 YOU SHOULD LIST ANY POINTS OF AGREEMENT ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE
NOT MATTERS OF GENERAL OR WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT
YOU SHOULD MENTION ANYTHING YOU HAVE LEARNED FROM YOUR TARGET
ONLY THEN ARE YOU PERMITTED TO SAY SO MUCH AS A WORD OF REBUTTAL OR CRITICISM
I CAN'T READ
REMOVED
SOLID ARGUMENT FOR JESUS HORRIBLE ARGUMENT FOR HUMANS
FIRST OF ALL IF THEY PEOPLE ATTACKING HIM ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF HALLUCINATIONS AND ARE BEING CONTROLLED TO MURDER YOU THEN THOSE PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR AGENCY AND THEREFORE KILLING THEM OFF WOULDN'T MAKE A SHRED OF DIFFERENCE TO THEIR WELL-BEING MUCH LIKE ABORTING A FETUS IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY SELF AGENCY AND THEREFORE ACCORDING TO MAN'S LAWS IT ISN'T A PERSON
I'M STILL NOT SEEING THE PROBLEM
IS THE PROBLEM OF SELF-DEFENSE THAT OF BEING UNCERTAIN OF THE TRANSCENDENT EXISTENCE OF OTHERS OR SOMETHING ELSE ISN'T IT THAT THE MOTIVATIONS ARE AT LEAST SUSPECT GIVEN THE CHOICE OF KILLERS FOR NEIGHBORS I'D WOULD RATHER HAVE A DEFENDER THAN AN ATTACKER
BY ACCEPTING TO DIE HE CAN SAVE THE LIVES OF MULTIPLE FELLOW CONSCIOUS BEINGS AND HE DOES NOT SHY AWAY FROM THIS BECAUSE OF HIS SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH HIMSELF

CONSIDERING THAT THOSE MULTIPLE FELLOW CONSCIOUS BEINGS ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO KILL HIM INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY FROM THE GUN I WOULD SAY THAT KILLING IN SELF DEFENSE IS JUSTIFIED
NEVERTHELESS FROM A MORAL POINT OF VIEW NO ONE WILL CONSIDER THAT THE MAN WHO KILLS SCORES OF PEOPLE TO SAVE HIS OWN LIFE IS A GOOD MAN AS THE LIVES OF SEVERAL FELLOW CONSCIOUS BEINGS MUST BE WORTH MORE THAN THE LIFE OF ONE CONSCIOUS BEING

ACTUALLY I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE WHO WOULD FAULT THE MAN WHO KILLED
I DON'T THINK MANY MORAL REALISTS WOULD WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH YOUR IDEA HERE AS THIS APPEARS TO BE A NEW LOW FOR MORAL REALISTS

YOU SHOULDN'T KILL IN SELF DEFENSE BECAUSE THE LIVES OF THOSE ATTACKING YOU ARE PRECIOUS OH AND YOUR LIFE AS THE PERSON DEFENDING YOURSELF GIVE IT UP SO THE UTILITARIANS CAN CHALK UP A LITTLE LESS OVERALL SUFFERING ON THEIR GREAT MEANINGLESS SCOREBOARD OF SUFFERING WHICH RECORDS ONLY DEATHS APPARENTLY

WHAT KIND OF DELUDED WORLD-VIEW LEADS YOU TO THINK A FEW LIVES IN EITHER DIRECTION MATTERS IN A UNIVERSE THAT'S BILLIONS OF YEARS OLD

YES THOSE POOR HALLUCINATING FELLOWS ARE DEAD BUT IF YOUR ONLY OPTIONS ARE KILL OR DIE ESCAPE AND INCAPACITATION BEING HYPOTHETICALLY IMPOSSIBLE THE NATURAL SELECTION IS TO KILL FOR THE SAKE OF THE GENE POOL NOT TO SACRIFICE ONESELF TO UTILITARIAN FANTASIES
TASK THE UNIVERSAL PREBALANCE OF RELIGION AND THE STUDY OF MORALITY BEING THE PROVISO OF A TINY ELITE MADE THIS MORE ACHIEVABLE IN THE PAST GOD SAYS THIS IS HOW IT IS SO THAT IS HOW IT IS WITHOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO GET PEOPLE INTO LINE I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN DO IT NOT THAT YOU'RE WRONG THOUGH
PERHAPS THE ETHICAL POSITIONS YOU MENTION ARE ALL ESSENTIALLY COMIC BOOK FORMULAS THE SENSE OF NECESSITY YOU BRING UP WOULD APPEAR TO SUGGEST DIGGING DEEPER
TO SUMMARISE THE CORE OF MY ARGUMENT
WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ETHICAL THEORIES IN THE WORLD AND MANY OF THEM CONFLICT IN CERTAIN SCENARIOS RESULTING IN GAMES I ARGUE THAT CONVERGING ON AN ETHICAL THEORY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO
I READ THAT AS PLAGIARISM I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL HE SAID THE WORD ALOUD BOY DO I FEEL SILLY
SOUNDS LIKE A BAD REHASH OF OBJECTIVISM
I THINK THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD SUMMARY ONE OF THE BIG MAJOR POINTS TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT DESCARTES WAS NOT OPERATING IN A VACUUM BUT IN MANY WAYS RESPONDING TO A CULTURE THAT SOUGHT PHILOSOPHIC GROUNDING IN ANCIENT WORKS PEOPLE LIKE DESCARTES AND BACON ARE REBELLING AGAINST THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD DEFER TO THE WRITINGS OF ARISTOTLE AS THE FOUNDATION OF KNOWLEDGE AND IN FAIRNESS THERE'S NO SIGN THAT ARISTOTLE ACTUALLY INTENDED TO BECOME THE OBJECT OF UNQUESTIONED AUTHORITY

THIS MOVIE DOES A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF EXPLAINING DESCARTES FIRST BIG MOVE WHICH IS THE FAMOUS COGITO ERGO SUM IDEA WHEN HE STARTS FROM DOUBTING EVERYTHING THE FIRST THING THAT HE FEELS COMFORTABLE ASSUMING IS THAT HE MUST EXIST TO PARAPHRASE THE ARGUMENT BRIEFLY HE HAS DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF HIS THOUGHTS AND PERCEPTIONS WHICH TELLS HIM THAT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THINKING AND PERCEIVING EVEN IF THE THOUGHTS AND PERCEPTIONS ARE INCORRECT

THE OTHER SINGLE BIGGEST ARGUMENT IS ABOUT WHETHER HE CAN TRUST ANY OF HIS OTHER PERCEPTIONS AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY SO SINCE HIS ARGUMENTS BRING UP THE IDEA OF GOD AND OR SATAN A EVIL GENIUS DECEIVER DEMON WHICH ENDS UP BEING PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE HOWEVER HIS ARGUMENT IS ULTIMATELY NOT A RELIGIOUS ARGUMENT AND IT BREAKS DOWN LIKE THIS

IF I TAKE THE CONTENT OF MY PERCEPTIONS THERE ARE REALLY TWO BASIC POSSIBILITIES EITHER MY THOUGHTS AND PERCEPTIONS ARE BEING MADE BY SOMETHING TO CONFORM TO REALITY TO SOME EXTENT OR MY THOUGHTS AND PERCEPTIONS ARE COMPLETE FICTION AND THOROUGHLY UNTRUSTWORTHY I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING FOR SURE BUT IF IT'S THE LATTER THEN THE SITUATION IS COMPLETELY HOPELESS AND I CAN NEVER KNOW ANYTHING THEREFORE MY ONLY OPTION IS TO ASSUME THE FORMER THAT MY THOUGHTS AND PERCEPTIONS AT LEAST BEAR SOME RESEMBLANCE TO REALITY EVEN IF THEY'RE SOMETIMES LEAD ASTRAY
THOUGHT DOES NOT IMPLY A THINKER DOUBT DOES NOT IMPLY A DOUBTER THESE ARE JUST CONVENTIONS OF LANGUAGE OUR LANGUAGE NECESSITATES AN AGENT WHO DOES THINGS IN REALITY THERE IS NO NEED FOR THIS

TAKE THE SENTENCE IT IS RAINING LANGUAGE DEMANDS THERE IS AN AGENT DOING THE RAINING THE IT IN REALITY THERE IS NO AGENT THERE IS ONLY RAINING SAME AS IN I AM THINKING THERE IS MERELY THINKING OR THOUGHT BUT NO ONE DOING THE THINKING NO THINKER

SURPRISES ME PEOPLE DO NOT SEE THIS SIMPLE FACT
FOAH THANK YOU FOR THIS I'VE JUST STARTED A LEVEL PHILOSOPHY AND WE COVERED THIS YESTERDAY SO I NEEDED A BIT OF REVISION MATERIAL PERFECT TIMING AND EXCELLENT VIDEO
I DOUBT THEREFORE I AM
LONG STORY SHORT HE RAMBLES ON ABOUT ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OF HIS EXISTENCE THEN AFTER EXHAUSTING ALL THOSE DECIDES AT THE END THERE MUST BE A GOD AND THE FACT HE CAN THINK PROVES HIS EXISTENCE ON SOME LEVEL
IS THERE ANY WAY TO REFUTE THIS HAS ANY OTHER PHILOSOPHER OR PERSON COME UP WITH AN ACTUAL ARGUMENT I THINK THEREFORE I AM
I THINK THEREFORE I AM BEGS THE QUESTION THE ARGUMENT DOES NOT ESTABLISH AN I IT ASSUMES IT A CORRECT COGITO ARGUMENT IS THIS IS A THOUGHT THEREFORE THOUGHTS EXIST

ESTABLISHING THE EXISTENCE OF A TRUE SUBJECT IS NOT NEARLY SO EASY OR MATERIALISM WOULD HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN DISCREDITED
THOUGHT IS MEANINGLESS AND HAS NO RELATION TO BEING
WHEN WE LEARNED THIS IN SCHOOL MY TEACHER EXPLAINED TO THIS GIRL HOW ANSWERS ARE NOT WHAT STRIVE PHILOSOPHERS TO DO WHAT THEY DO HE GAVE AN EXAMPLE THAT DESCARTES ALSO SAID THAT A PART OF OUR BRAIN WAS A PINECONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I'VE TRIED LOOKING IT UP BUT COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING DOES THIS SAY ANYTHING TO ANY ONE CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME PLEASE
I FEEL THAT THE COGITO ARGUMENT WORKS WELL ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT CAN ESCAPE HIS RADICAL DOUBT HE DOUBTS HIS SENSES AND HIS INTUITIONS BUT SEEMS TO TAKE REASON FOR GRANTED COULDN'T REASON BE IN ERROR THROUGH THE SAME LOGIC HE USES TO DOUBT MATHEMATICAL TRUTHS
I HAD A DRINK THROWN ON ME BY A PRETENTIOUS WOMAN THAT COULDN'T NAME HIM BASED ON HIS FAMOUS QUOTE SHE HAD PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR DESCARTES QUOTE IS THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER FROM MY FRESHMAN PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL I WAS TRYING TO EXIST WITH HER IT DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR ME THAT NIGHT
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SUCCESSFULLY MEDITATE IF YOU ARE NOT THINKING YOU ARE NOT A BEING WHAT ABOUT SLEEPING
POOR DESCARTES THE FATHER OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY ERGO THE SCAPEGOAT OF OUR ERA CENTURIES OF PHILOSOPHERS BUILDING THEIR THEORIES ON WHY DESCARTES WAS WRONG

HERE'S A NICE EXPERIMENT TRY ARGUING IN FAVOR OF DESCARTES IT IS A MUCH HARDER TASK THAN YOU WOULD ASSUME I BELIEVE EMMANUEL LEVINA DID A DECENT JOB AT THIS BUT IT'S BEEN A WHILE IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE TANGENTIALLY RELATED
I THINK THEREFORE I AM NOT SURE
SUMMARY
I THINK THEREFORE I AM ALMOST EVERYONE HAS HEARD OF REN DESCARTES FAMOUS COGITO ARGUMENT BUT WHAT IS THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT DOES IT SHOW AND WHY ARE SO MANY PHILOSOPHERS EXCITED ABOUT IT EVEN TODAY MORE THAN YEARS AFTER DESCARTES FIRST PRESENTED THIS ARGUMENT IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO STEPHAN SCHMID HUMBOLDT EXPLORES THESE QUESTIONS

THANKS FOR WATCHING IF YOU LIKE OUR VIDEOS PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL

WIPHI
I THINK THEREFORE I AM
2 I SLEEP THEREFORE I STOP THINKING
I STOP THINKING EVERYDAY THEREFORE MAYBE I CEASE EVERYDAY
IF I CEASE EVERYDAY HOW DO I KNOW IT IS I WHO WAKES
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF VIDEOS AND ARTICLES OUT THERE WHO COVER THIS TOPIC WHAT MOTIVATES YOU TO CREATE ANOTHER ONE
DESCARTES FAMOUS SENTENCE IS COGITO ERGO SUM
I THOUGHT THIS ARGUMENT WAS HIS PROOF THAT HARD SOLIPSISM WASN'T TRUE
I AM THEREFORE I THINK
I THINK THEREFORE I AM THEREFORE BECAUSE OF RULE THERE IS A PORN OF ME
COGITO THE NAME OF MY EPIC DEPARTMENT
I ALWAYS FOUND THIS INTERESTING MONKS MEDITATE FOR DAYS WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS AT A TIME THEY SHUT OFF THEIR MINDS AND AREN'T THINKING AT ALL
BUT THEY ARE INDEED BEING WITH THEIR SURROUNDINGS

DOES MEDITATION MAKE HIS THEORY WRONG
DO I THINK DOES A SUBMARINE SWIM
HARVEST THE LAND
ARE WE TRULY IN CONTROL OF OUR OWN BRAINS QUANTITATIVELY I'D SAY NUMBER SURE WE DO THINGS LIKE EAT SLEEP GO TO WORK AND WHAT EVER ELSE WILL IT BUT THESE THINGS ARE SO SECOND HAND ITS LIKE THERE IS NO THOUGHT OUT PROCESS WE JUST DO NOTHING AT LEAST THAT I WILL STOP TO THINK ABOUT ON A DAILY BASIS LIFE TO ME IS SO NATURAL THAT IT'S ALMOST BOTHERSOME IN A WAY I FEEL AS IF MY EXISTENCE IS NOT COMPLETELY IN MY CONTROL THOUGHTS
HOLY COW WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BRAIN
SO IF HE IS WORRIED ABOUT BEING DECEIVED HOW IS HE SO SURE HIS THOUGHTS ARE PURE AND NOT BEING DECEIVED

WHEN HE SAYS WHEN WE DOUBT WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT WE DOUBT BUT UNDER WHAT RATIONAL IF HE IS WORRIED ABOUT DECEPTION AT ANY POINT OR PLACE I'M REALITY THEN EVEN THE ATOMS OR ELEMENTS THAT COMPRISE MYSELF MAY BE FALLACIOUS AND HENCE EVEN MY OWN THOUGHTS
WHAT EXISTS WITHOUT THE THOUGHT
WATCH V LZHMUNZXJEM
I FEEL LIKE IT MEANS EXACTLY WHAT'LL IT SOUNDS LIKE
THIS WASN'T MUCH MORE OF AN EXPLANATION THAN THE SENTENCE ITSELF


THE COGITO FAILS INSOFAR AS IT ASSUMES THE EXISTENCE OF TRUTH AND LOGIC WHILE REMAINING SKEPTICAL OF THESE TWO THINGS IT DENIES THE EXISTENCE OF EVERYTHING BESIDES THE DOUBT THEN BRINGS INTO EXISTENCE AGAIN DIFFERENT CONCEPTS UNJUSTLY WHY AM I TO SUPPOSE GIVEN THAT I AM A FALLIBLE CREATURE CAPABLE OF ERROR IN THE MOST BASIC PERCEPTION THE EXISTENCE OF LOGIC OR TRUTH

I READ ON A COMMENT ON REDDIN ACTUALLY THAT HE FIRST WROTE THE WORDS IN HIS NATIVE FRENCH JE PONS CONC JE USIS AT LEAST I THINK THAT'S HOW YOU SPELL IT
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE CRITICIZED THE PHRASE IN THAT IT PRESUPPOSES THAT THERE IS AN I THAT THERE IS SUCH AN ACTIVITY AS THINKING AND THAT I KNOW WHAT THINKING IS
IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO SAY I AM THEREFORE I THINK THE I IDEA COMES FIRST NOT THOUGHT
AYE I STUDIED HIM IN MY HS PHILOSOPHY CLASS A COUPLE WEEKS BACK NOW WE'RE STUDYING HUME
DOES HE ALSO SAY PASS THROUGH THE THE IRIS
RENE DESCARTES WAS A DRUNKEN FART
I DRINK THEREFORE I AM
I AM THEREFORE I THINK A LOT LESS CONTROVERSIAL
I AM THEN PROCEED TO WATCH THOUGHTS APPEAR THROUGH NO ACTUAL DOER NAMED I
THINKING THINGS EXIST

2 I AM A THINKING THING HERE HE IMPLICITLY STATES HIS EXISTENCE BEFORE ACTUALLY CONCLUDING HE EXISTS

THEREFORE I EXIST

THIS IS LOGICALLY TRIVIAL AND ALMOST COMPLETELY UNINTERESTING

EDIT FURTHERMORE THE NOTION OF PROVING SOMETHING USING LOGIC IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD TRILEMMA DOG
I TINK DEFLORE I AM
I AM THEREFORE I THINK
BUT BUT BUT I THINK THEREFORE I AM IS A CRAPPY TRANSLATION MISSING THE POINT IF TRAVELLING THIS ROAD
A MAJOR WEAKNESS OF THIS PAPER IS THAT IT SUGGESTS A WAY TO GIVE PROBABILITIES TO SENTENCES BUT THE METHOD PROPOSED DOES NOT YIELD THE ANSWERS THAT ARE USED IN THE MOTIVATING EXAMPLES THEY SAY THAT THE PROBABILITY THAT THE NTH DIGIT OF PI IS A SHOULD BE BUT AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THEIR METHOD FIRSTLY DOES NOT WOK FOR THIS EXAMPLE AS THE NTH DIGIT OF PI IN COMPUTABLE IN LINEAR TIME AND SECONDLY EVEN IF A NON POLYNOMIAL TIME SEQUENCE IS USED THE PROBABILITY WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE ANY PROBABILITY IS JUSTIFIABLE FOR A RANDOM SEQUENCE SO LONG AS THE OTHER PROBABILITIES ASSIGNED ADD UP IN THE USUAL WAY

I COULD BE WRONG BUT WHILE THE PROBABILITY OF THE F N TH DIGIT OF PI BEING IS IN AGGREGATE OVER MANY N THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT HAS TO BE FOR A PARTICULAR NOUN SUPPOSE FOR A PARTICULAR F N CALL IT SOME LARGE NUMBER WE LET THE PROBABILITY BE THERE IS A DUTCH BOOKIE THAT BUYS THESE SHARES BUT THERE IS ALSO A DUTCH BOOKIE THAT BUYS THE SHARE THE DIGIT IS AND IT IS RIGHT SUPPOSE SO IT MAKES MONEY PERHAPS SOME PROPERTY OF THE ORDERING OF BOOKIES MAKES CERTAIN BOOKIES SHOW UP EARLIER THAN OTHERS AND CAUSES THINGS TO AVERAGE OUT

I AGREE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION AS I UNDERSTAND IT CREATES AN ASSIGNMENT THAT IS NOT POLYNOMIAL TIME EXPLOITABLE WHAT I DO NOT SEE IS WHY THIS ASSIGNMENT WILL NECESSARILY GIVE TO THIS PROBLEM WHERE IN THE PAPER IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN AND THE INTUITIVE PROBABILITIES THAT WE WOULD GUESS MADE
THIS IS SIMPLY AMAZING WORK UNBELIEVABLE I CAN'T EVEN BEGAN TO IMAGINE WHAT IT WILL LEAD TOO WITH MODERN TECH AND FUTURE TECH

OK SO TRUTHFULLY I DID NOT READ ALL OF IT BECAUSE MOST OF THE MATH IS JUST BEYOND ME BUT I CAN FOLLOW SOME OF IT AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND SO FAR ITS JUST AMAZING WORK

SIMPLY GENIUS
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU BECOME SO PROFICIENT IN YOUR SECOND LANGUAGE THAT YOU THINK QUICKER IN IT THAN IN YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE IF THE RESEARCHERS HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE INCREASED PROPENSITY FOR UTILITARIANISM IS CAUSED BY THAT EXTRA MOMENT OF DELIBERATION THEY SHOULD TEST THAT WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO'VE LEARNED THE SECOND LANGUAGE WHILE THEY WERE YOUNG AND ARE FLUENT BUT WHO DON'T GET TO PRACTICE THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE OFTEN
DELETED
I'M THE NARRATOR FOR THE AUDIBLE VERSION OF THIS ARTICLE IT WAS A PRETTY INTERESTING ONE TO ME BECAUSE I ALMOST PURSUED A LINGUISTICS DEGREE IN COLLEGE BUT CHANGED MAJORS THE AUDIO VERSION SHOULD BE POSTED SOMETIME LATER THIS WEEK OR EARLY NEXT

IT APPEARS TO ME THAT I DON'T EVEN THINK IN WORDS MOST OF THE TIME MOSTLY ONLY WHEN I'M SPECIFICALLY TRYING TO FORMULATE A MESSAGE THAT I'LL HAVE TO COMMUNICATE THE REST OF THE TIME IT SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF IMAGES OR GESTALTS THAT REPRESENT CONCEPTS IN SOME KIND OF VISUAL WAY THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME ITS HARD TO DESCRIBE

FUNNY THING IF YOU EVER FIND SOMETHING TO BE HARD TO DESCRIBE I COULD ASSUME THAT YOU WEREN'T THINKING IT IN WORDS TO BEGIN WITH

NOT SURE WHAT THIS MEANS TO THE ARTICLE BUT I GUESS NOT EVERYONE WORKS THE SAME
I BROUGHT THIS SUBJECT UP ONCE AT A DINNER PARTY THE FRIDAY OR SATURDAY I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT AFTER AND NO ONE BELIEVED ME EITHER I EXPLAINED IT HORRIBLY OR EVERYONE WAS STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW PEOPLE COULD DO SUCH A THING
I'M SURPRISED THAT THE ARTICLE DID NOT TOUCH ON THE CULTURAL ASPECT OF LANGUAGE OR SUBCONSCIOUS NATIONALIST ATTITUDES
I THINK THE COMMENTS HERE MISS THE POINT NO ONE SAID THEY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THE MORAL JUDGEMENTS AND WHOSE TO SAY THAT THEY WEREN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN THE NATIVE LANGUAGE AS OPPOSED TO READ OR HEARD IN THE FOREIGN THOUGH I DO BELIEVE THE AUTHOR TO BE CORRECT IN HER SUPPOSITION THAT NATIVE LANGUAGES CARRY WITH THEM THE WEIGHT OF EMOTION AND PRIOR CONTEXT I ALSO THINK THAT THIS MAY CARRY WITH IT COMPLICATIONS ABOUT HOW INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS INTERACT WITH EACHOTHER FOR EXAMPLE TAKE THE SHOW NARCOS AGENT PEA SPEAKS PRIMARILY SPANISH WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE COLOMBIAN POLICE WHAT IF HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE WAS ENGLISH WOULD HE BE MORE LIKELY TO MAKE MORE LOGICAL DECISIONS AS A DEA AGENT IN COLUMBIA THAT HE WOULD IN THE US I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS COULD BE TESTED FOR BUT THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THE ARTICLE SAYS YES

EDIT SPELLING BECAUSE APPARENTLY I'M AN UNCULTURED FOOL MY ASSESSMENT
I'M SKEPTICAL OF ATTEMPTS TO STUDY MORAL REASONING BY ASKING PEOPLE ABOUT THE TROLLEY PROBLEM TO WHAT EXTENT IF AT ALL DOES PONDERING AN ABSTRACT HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION MATCH OUR ACTUAL DELIBERATION PROCESSES WHEN DEALING WITH ACTUAL MORAL DILEMMAS IT SEEMS LIKE SO MANY MORALLY RELEVANT FACTORS SUCH AS OUR CAPACITY TO BE MOVED EMOTIONALLY BY THE PERCEIVED DISTRESS OF ANOTHER PERSON ARE LEFT OUT IN THE PROCESS
THIS NOW EXPLAINS WHY TO THIS DAY WHEN ENGLISH IS MORE NATIVE TO ME THAN THE LANGUAGE I GREW UP SPEAKING I WOULD NEVER DARE SWEAR IN MY NATIVE LANGUAGE AND HEARING SOMEONE ELSE SWEAR IN IT SHOCKS ME WHILE I CAN UNLEASH THE WORST ATTACK WITHOUT BATTING AN EYELASH
THIS GETS PROGRESSIVELY HARDER THE MORE VARIED THE LANGUAGES ARE REGARDING THEIR GRAMMAR SYNTAX CULTURAL INFLUENCE ETC

I SPEAK JAPANESE AS WELL AS I SPEAK ENGLISH AND VERBS COMING AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE IN JAPANESE CAN REALLY SCREW YOU UP IN ENGLISH IF YOU PUT TOO MUCH THOUGHT IN IT I CAN'T TELL IF I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE APPLE I'M EATING OR THE ACTUAL CONCEPT OF EATING

ENGLISH EAT AN APPLE
JAPANESE APPLE EAT CRUDE BUT TRUE
NEWS FLASH DIFFICULT MORAL JUDGMENTS CAN CHANGE IF YOU PONDER THEM
IS IT NOT BECAUSE YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE CARRIES EMOTIONAL WEIGHT IN THE WORDS THAT A LEARNED LANGUAGE DOES NOT
IF YOU WANT IT THIS EFFECT CAN BE USED IN YOUR OWN LANGUAGE PHENI WAS LITTLE AROUND MY FATHER TEACHED ME A TRICK IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE GOING THROUGH AN ARGUMENT BECAUSE A WORD OFFENDS YOU THEN CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING NEUTRAL AND REDEFINE THE NEW TERM EXAMPLE IN AN ARGUMENT I MAY HAVE TO USE THE TERM FASCIST IN A DESCRIPTIVE WAY TO MAKE A POINT TO AVOID CLOUDING MY CONSCIOUSNESS WITH THE INNER RAGE CONNECTED TO THAT TERM I KNOW THAT FASCISTS ARE EATING BABIES DESTROYING CULTURE AND MAY EVEN SHUDDER BE MAGA SPORTERS I BEGIN BY CHOSING A NEUTRAL TERM SMITH OR WHATEVER AND MENTALLY LIST THE NECESSARY ATTRIBUTES TAKEN FROM THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF FASCISM AND THEN CONTINUE TO USE THE NEW NORDIN MY MIND JUST UP TO THE POINT OF VOCALISATION WHERE I WILL EXCHANGE THE ERSATZ WORD SMITH WITH THE CORRECT WORD FOR THE TERM FASCISM WHICH IS THE WORD FASCISM THAT WAY I AVOID INNER TURMOIL AND CAN USE CALM AND RATIONAL ARGUMENTS TO US WHO ARE TOO THAT IS AN EASY EXTRA IQ POINTS THROUGHOUT MY LIFE IF HAVE USED THIS TECHNIQUE AND THE ONLY DOWNSIDE I HAVE FOUND IS THAT I HAVE TO THINK QUICK IT DO NOT WORK IF I'M DRUNK OR TIRED BUT I HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT SOME PEOPLE HATE THE THOUGHT THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE SO TO AVOID GETTING PUNCHED IN THE FACE I ONLY MENTION THIS TECHNIQUE TO THOSE WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED CAPACITY FOR NUANCED THINKING
I DON'T THINK IN ANY PARTICULAR LANGUAGE BUT ALL SPEAK ENGLISH MORE PROFICIENTLY
REMOVED
AS A FRENCH I OFTEN SEE ENGLISH AS A LANGUAGE OF BUSINESS IT CARIES LESS EMOTION FOR ME TO SAY I LOVE THAN ITS FRENCH EQUIVALENT ON THE OTHER END MY WIFE WHOSE MOTHER LANGUAGE ISN'T FRENCH PREFERS TO SAY IT IN FRENCH
THAT EXPLAINS WHY I TEND TO USE ENGLISH EVEN FRENCH WORDS WHEN I DISCUSS SOME SENSITIVE SOCIAL ISSUES WITH MY FRIENDS LIKE GAY SEX OR PROSTITUTION INSTEAD OF USING CHINESE
CANADIAN GOVERNMENT EN FRANCOIS
I BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE COMES FROM THE FACT THAT IT'S SIMPLY MORE DIFFICULT TO THINK AT ALL IN A SECOND LANGUAGE OR MORE DARKLY IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE SIMPLY VALUE HUMAN LIFE LESS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOREIGNERS
NUMBERS ALONE DO NOT CREATE A MORALLY EQUIVALENT SITUATION IN THE FIRST HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION BOTH THE GROUP OF PEOPLE AND THE INDIVIDUAL ARE IN DANGER WE ARE LEFT ONLY TO CHOOSE WHICH WE CAN SAVE WE NATURALLY CHOOSE TO SAVE MORE IN THE SECOND SCENARIO WE'RE ASKED TO KILL AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER WHO WAS NOT IN DANGER THIS IS MURDER OUR MOTIVATION TO SAVE A LARGER GROUP DOESN'T CHANGE THAT AND WON'T BE ACCEPTED AS A DEFENSE IN COURT EITHER WE'RE BEING ASKED TO KILL SOMEONE WHEN WE CAN OBVIOUSLY SAVE THE GROUP BY ANOTHER MEANS IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO SAVE THE PEOPLE BY THROWING SOMEONE INTO THE PATH OF THE TRAIN A HIGHLY UNLIKELY SCENARIO ANYWAY THEN IT WOULD BE MORALLY RIGHT TO SACRIFICE OURSELVES BY LEAPING ONTO THE TRACKS BUT NOT TO MURDER SOMEONE ELSE

INTERESTING STUDY BUT IT SO FRUSTRATING WHEN PAPERS REFERENCE THE TROLLY THOUGHT EXPERIMENT WITHOUT ATTRIBUTING IT TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHO GAVE IT TO US
IT IS SOMEHOW TRUE BENGALI S IN SPEAK IN ENGLISH WHEN THEY ARE SUPERCHARGED AND ANGRY
CHECK OUT THE THEORY ABOUT THIS ARTICLE
I COULD PROBABLY BE COUNTED FROM BIRTH WAS TAUGHT BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH WAS EDUCATED IN BOTH LANGUAGES SPANISH IMMERSION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FROM KINDERGARTEN TO 5TH GRADE SO I WAS A NATIVE SPEAKER OF BOTH UNTIL I WAS AROUND YEARS OLD I WATCHED TV PROGRAMS AND MOVIES IN EITHER LANGUAGE LISTENED TO MUSIC IN EITHER I THOUGHT AND DREAMT IN BOTH LANGUAGES THERE WASN'T A SPECIFIC SITUATION THAT TRIGGERED ONE OR THE OTHER MY FAMILY EXCEPT MY DAD SPOKE BOTH AT HOME MY BRAIN WOULD JUST SWITCH BACK AND FORTH TO THINKING IN WHATEVER LANGUAGE I WAS SPEAKING IN

IN 6TH GRADE I SWITCHED TO A GERMAN PROGRAM AND HAVE BEEN TAKING GERMAN LESSONS EVER SINCE I'M NOW SO YEARS OF GERMAN I HAVE FORGOTTEN ALMOST ALL OF MY SPANISH BUT CONSIDER MYSELF FLUENT IN ENGLISH AND GERMAN MOST OF MY TECHNICAL VOCABULARY IS IN ENGLISH SO I TEND TO DEFAULT TO ENGLISH ONLINE AND WHEN SPEAKING IN A TECHNICAL ACADEMIC SETTING I LIVE IN AN ENGLISH SPEAKING COUNTRY AND ENGLISH IS THE ONLY LANGUAGE AT WORK AS WELL BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEM SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO LANGUAGES IN FACT BECAUSE OF HOW GERMAN IS STRUCTURED I CAN PICK UP A TECHNICAL MANUAL AND PIECE MY WAY THROUGH IT GERMAN USES COMPOUND NOUNS SO LONG COMPLEX WORDS ARE JUST A BUNCH OF SMALLER WORDS THROWN TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION A DUAL CLUTCH AUTOMATIC IS A DOPPELKUPPLUNGSGETRIEBE DOPPED MEANS DOUBLE KLUPPLUNG MEANS CLUTCH OR COUPLING GETRIEBE IS GEARING LITERALLY ALL THREE OF THOSE WORDS ARE ENGLISH COGNATES SO IT'S EASY TO PUT TOGETHER

I ALWAYS HATED ENGLISH CLASS GROWING UP SO I COULDN'T TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT ENGLISH GRAMMAR BUT GERMAN GRAMMAR HAS BEEN DRILLED INTO ME I COULD HONESTLY TELL YOU MORE ABOUT TENSES AND CASES AND PARTS OF SPEECH IN GERMAN THAN I COULD IN ENGLISH

I'VE HEARD OF THIS THEORY BEFORE THOUGH THAT PEOPLE THINK MORE CRITICALLY ARE LESS BIASED AND CAN EXPRESS HONEST OPINIONS EASIER IN A SECOND LANGUAGE THAN IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE I CAN'T REALLY DECIDE IF I AGREE OR NOT WHEN WORKING ON SOMETHING IN GERMAN IT DOES TAKE ME SLIGHTLY MORE MENTAL EFFORT HOWEVER CULTURALLY GERMAN IS A MORE DIRECT LANGUAGE WHEN SPEAKING GERMAN YOU DON'T USE AS MANY PLEASANTRIES AS YOU DO IN ENGLISH GERMANS ARE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD ABOUT EVERYTHING IF YOU ASK A GERMAN DOES THIS MAKE ME LOOK FAT AND IT DOES GERMANS WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM POINTING THIS OUT WHEREAS ENGLISH SPEAKERS OR AT LEAST AMERICANS WILL BRUSH IT OFF WITH PLEASANTRIES
I THINK THIS CONFIRMS THE STUDY OF LINGUISTICS AND SOCIOLOGY ALONG WITH PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS THAT OUR THOUGHTS ARE LARGELY DETERMINED BY OUR LANGUAGE SYNTAX AND SEMIOTIC PROCESSES NOT TO MENTION SINCE WE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS EVEN WITHIN THESE SAME LANGUAGE CATEGORIES WE CAN COME TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS OF MORALITY AS WELL INTERESTING READ
THAT'S SOME JUNK CULTURAL RELATIVISM THERE
THIS ARTICLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHY ISN'T THE STUDY OF HOW PEOPLE THINK THAT IS LEFT TO THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES

MORALITY ISN'T RELATIVE
MORALITY IS THE THE RESULT OF GRADUALLY OVERCOMING OUR NATURAL INSTINCTS FOR COMPETITION AND SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST WITH LEARNT RULES AND TRADITIONS IF YOU ANALYZE MORALITY THROUGH THE LENS OF HAYEK YOU FIND IT IS MERELY INSTINCT WITH TRADITION THAT MAKES SOCIETY MORE PRODUCTIVE AND COHESIVE BECAUSE GENERALLY ACCEPTED TRADITIONS AND RULES LIKE ALTRUISM EMPATHY OVERCOME OUR NATURAL INSTINCT FOR COMPETITION AND ALLOW HUMANS TO ACHIEVE GROUP PROGRESS

AN INTERESTING QUOTES THAT MIGHT INTRIGUE YOU

TO REPEAT CARTESIAN DUALISM WAS A PERFECTLY RESPECTABLE SCIENTIFIC DOCTRINE DISPROVEN BY NEWTON WHO EXORCISED THE MACHINE LEAVING THE GHOST INTACT CONTRARY TO WHAT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED

IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO POST THESE AT LINKS THAT WAY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH TWO CLICKS ESPECIALLY ON MOBILE

VERY GLAD YOU'RE POSTING THEM
I FELT LIKE MACKINNON HAD A VERY WEAK ARGUMENT TO ME IT SEEMS THAT SHE WANTS TO REDEFINE POSITIONS OF POWER AND POWERLESSNESS AS MALE AND FEMALE RESPECTIVELY ALL THE WHILE CLAIMING THAT THIS WON'T BE TOXIC

I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY FAIR BY THE 2 MINUTE MARK SHE IS ALREADY EXPLAINING WHY SHE TAKES IT TO BE THE CASE THAT MASCULINE AND FEMININE STAND IN THAT POWER RELATION SHE CERTAINLY IS NOT JUST ASSERTING THIS

I'M NOT SURE TO WHAT END THIS SERVES

AND BY THE MINUTE MARK SHE IS EXPLAINING WHAT END THIS THAT IT AIDS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PHENOMENA AND AIDS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO COMBAT THESE PHENOMENA

AND WHEN TALKING ABOUT PROSTITUTION AND THEN CHILD SOLDIERS SHE SEEMS TO BE GIVING SOME PRETTY CLEAR EXAMPLES OF THE RELEVANCE OF GENDER AND HOW THIS HELPS TO ILLUMINATE THOSE INSTITUTIONS


IN GENERAL IT'S BETTER TO POST THESE AS LINKS SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE CLICKS
HAVEN'T LISTENED TO PHILOSOPHY BITE FOR A WHILE MUST CATCH UP
YEAH THATS PRETTY MUCH HER DEAL KIND OF A PONY
BASICALLY ALL ARGUMENTS I'VE HEARD AGAINST ABUSE OF ANIMALS SAY THE REASONS IT IS WRONG IS BECAUSE IT USES A KIND OF MIGHT MAKES RIGHT OR DISCRIMINATORY MORALS EQUATING THIS SORT OF SPECIESISM WITH RACISM AND ETC

YOU SHOULD READ SOME OF PETER ARTICLES ON THE TOPIC WHICH PRESENT A MUCH BETTER VERSION OF THE ARGUMENT THAN THE ONES YOU SEEM TO HAVE ENCOUNTERED

WHILE MY SUMMARY IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR READING IN DEPTH THE VERY SHORT VERSION OF THE UTILITARIAN ARGUMENT AGAINST FACTORY FARMING IS THAT IT MAKES THE WORLD A WORSE PLACE IT CREATES ENORMOUS ANIMAL SUFFERING AND KILLS BILLIONS OF ANIMALS PER YEAR IT IS ENORMOUSLY WASTEFUL BECAUSE FACTORY FARMS CONVERT EDIBLE GRAINS INTO MEAT HIGHLY INEFFICIENTLY AND THE ONLY BENEFIT IS THAT IT PRODUCES MEAT WHICH IS RELATIVELY CHEAP SEEING AS WE DON'T NEED TO EAT FACTORY FARMED MEAT IN SINCE VEGETABLE ALTERNATIVES THAT MEET ALL OUR DIETARY NEEDS EXIST AND CAN BE FOUND IN ANY SUPERMARKET THIS SEEMS TO BE STRICTLY A MATTER OF CONVENIENCE OR PREFERENCE THUS THE NET RESULT IS A HUGE INCREASE IN SUFFERING AND A HUGE WASTE OF EDIBLE CALORIES IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME CONVENIENCE AND EATING PLEASURE

THAT IS THE ARGUMENT AT LEAST MAKE OF IT WHAT YOU WILLIAM

ALSO MOST BUT NOT ALL MORAL PHILOSOPHIES HOLD THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF MORAL VALUE IN TREATING BEINGS WELL EVEN WHEN THEY CAN'T GET YOU BACK FOR TREATING THEM BADLY SOME MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT THE ONLY MORAL ACTS ARE THE ONES YOU DO FOR MORAL REASONS AND NOT OUT OF FEAR THAT SOMEONE MIGHT GET YOU BACK SO FEW MORAL PHILOSOPHIES WOULD SAY THAT IT IS MORALLY OKAY TO HURT OR EXPLOIT ANIMALS JUST BECAUSE WE CAN GET AWAY WITH DOING SO OR JUST BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SOMEONE DOING IT TO US IN TURN
BUT TO DETERMINE WHAT ACTION A PERSON SHOULD TAKE TO TRY AND ACHIEVE A BETTER WAY OF LIVING FOR HIMSELF OR OTHERS

ARE YOU INCLUDING MAMMALS UNDER OTHERS THAT COMPLETELY CHANGES THE INTERPRETATION

ANYWAY THE ANIMAL RIGHTS POSITION CLAIMS THAT MANY OR MOST ANIMALS DIFFERENT AS THEY ARE FROM HUMANS SHARE ENOUGH NEUROLOGICAL SIMILARITIES TO BE CONSIDERED SENTIENT AND SO ARE SUBJECT TO MOST OF THE MORAL STANDARDS WE APPLY TO HUMANS EAST G HARMING OR KILLING FOR PERSONAL GAIN IS UNETHICAL

MOST DEBATES OF THIS NATURE COME DOWN TO WHETHER ONE AGREES OR DISAGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT ANIMALS ARE SENTIENT OR AT LEAST SENTIENT ENOUGH TO BE CONSIDERED WORTHY OF ATTRIBUTING FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO THEM
FIRSTLY YOU HAVE GREAT MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF MORALITY YES THINGS ARE NOT GOOD OR BAD BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN MORALITY IS REDUCED TO A CYNICAL CONTRACTUAL SCHEME WHERE THINGS ARE ONLY LABELLED AS GOOD IF THEY ARE DIRECTLY PRACTICAL TO A PERSON YOU CORRECTLY SAY KILLING IS DEEMED WRONG BECAUSE IF EVERYONE WENT AROUND KILLING PEOPLE WELL WE'D ALL BE KILLED BUT THIS ISN'T THE ROOT OF WHY KILLING IS DEEMED WRONG OR WHY ANYTHING IS DEEMED WRONG FOR THAT MATTER IF SOMEONE MURDERS IN A FOREST AND NO THIRD PARTY IS THERE TO PERCEIVE IT A CORRECT CONSTRUCTION OF MORALITY WOULD STILL CONDEMN THE ACT IN THE SAME LIGHT AN ANIMAL WHO SUFFERS LACKING A HUMAN ALLY TO HAVE COMPASSION FOR IT STILL ENDURES A HARDSHIP THAT IS REAL
THE QUESTION IS NOT CAN THEY REASON NOR CAN THEY TALK BUT CAN THEY SUFFER JEREMY BENTHAM

I'M NOT TOO DEEP INTO PHILOSOPHY BUT I THINK I HAVE A PERSPECTIVE THAT MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING I AM A SMALL FAMILY FARMER AND I BUTCHER ANYWHERE FROM TO ANIMALS A YEAR I ALSO BALANCE ECONOMIC GAINS VERSUS ANIMAL WELFARE ON A DAILY BASIS ALSO THE WELFARE OF THE WILDLIFE THAT MAY NEED MY ANIMALS FOR SURVIVAL AS WELL A GOOD FARM HAS A HUGE ECOLOGICAL IMPACT THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE ANIMALS IS MY PRIMARY CONCERN BECAUSE THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE SERVICE THAT I AM SUPPLYING TO MY CUSTOMERS OBVIOUSLY THE AMBIGUITY THERE IS WHAT SETS THE QUALITY OF LIFE STANDARD AND WHY

FOR ME IT BOILS DOWN TO DEFINING WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE ANIMAL ARE BECAUSE BY DEFINITION OF THE TERM RAISING ONE ASSUMES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROVIDING FOR THE NEEDS OF THE ANIMAL THAT IS DONE ON A SPECIES BY SPECIES BASIS BECAUSE EACH SPECIES HAS ITS OWN NEEDS THAT HAVE TO BE ESTIMATED BY OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANIMAL MUCH OF THE DISGUST THAT CUSTOMERS HAVE WITH INDUSTRIAL FARMS COMES FROM THE FACT THAT CUSTOMERS KNOW THAT A CERTAIN ANIMAL HAS A SPECIFIC NEED THAT DUE TO MASS PRODUCTION CAN NOT BE MEET BY THE INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE ANIMALS LIVELIHOOD

THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF THE ANIMAL IS MORE OF A NATURALIST EXERCISE THE NEEDS OF THE ANIMAL ARE DERIVED FROM UNDERSTANDING AND CHARACTERIZING THE ANIMALS NATURAL METHODS TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF A SPECIES PROGRESS SO TO DOES OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR THAT ANIMAL

SO IN MY OPINION THE ETHICAL ARGUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRADE ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE ETHICAL ARGUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MOST OTHER TRADES DID THE FARMER FOLLOW HIS RESPONSIBILITY ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING FOR THE ANIMAL'S NEEDS AND SUPPLY TO HIS CUSTOMERS THE SERVICES THAT WERE EXPECTED


TO MANY PEOPLE MORALITY IS ABOUT SORTING ACTIONS INTO RIGHT AND WRONG KANTIANS SPECIFICALLY SORT INTO ALLOWABLE VS WRONG OTHER THAN THIS ONE LINE YOUR ARGUMENT SLANTS RATHER KANTIAN

SECOND YOU SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT MORALITY ONLY APPLIES TO HUMANS THAT IS HUMANS CAN REVOLT AND HARM YOU IS THE REASON TO BE NICE TO OTHER HUMANS A DIFFERENT APPROACH IS PLEASURE PAIN BEINGS THAT CAN EXPERIENCE PLEASURE OR PAIN SHOULD BE TREATED WITH MORAL SIGNIFICANCE ANIMALS CAN FEEL PAIN PLEASURE SOME ANIMALS CAN EVEN SPEAK THINK EMOTE

WHILE PERSONALLY I DISAGREE WITH THE ANIMAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND THUS AGREE WITH YOUR OVERALL TONE I DO BELIEVE THAT ANIMALS DESERVE MORAL CONSIDERATION AND THEREFORE BRING UP THE TWO PREVIOUS POINTS
DISCLAIMER I'M NOT SAYING I BELIEVE OR FOLLOW THIS AND IT'S GIVEN AS A AS FAR AS I'M AWARE
POSITION WHO THOUGHT LITTLE TO MORALITY A MATTER MORE OF TASTE THAN ANYTHING OBJECTIVE WHY THEN IS IT WRONG FOR THE OVERMAN TO BE CRUEL HIS REPLY WAS THAT IT WOULD BE DEMEANING FOR THE OVERMAN TO SO ACT INFLICTING NEEDLESS CRUELTY IS LOWERING ITS A NICE POINT IMO AS I SAY NOT ONE I FOLLOW I'M A SOFTIE BUT THEN N BROKE DOWN AT SEEING A HORSE BEING NEEDLESSLY WHIPPED
MORALITY AND MORAL JUDGMENTS ARE NOT TO DETERMINE WHAT IS INHERENTLY RIGHT OR WRONG BECAUSE NOTHING CAN BE INHERENTLY LIKE THAT

THAT IS WHAT MORALITY MEANS I HAVE A MORAL SYSTEM SO I CAN ALMOST ALWAYS DETERMINE WHAT IS INHERENTLY RIGHT OR WRONG

SIMPLE DEFINITION OF MORALITY

BELIEFS ABOUT WHAT IS RIGHT BEHAVIOR AND WHAT IS WRONG BEHAVIOR

THE DEGREE TO WHICH SOMETHING IS RIGHT AND GOOD THE MORAL GOODNESS OR BADNESS OF SOMETHING

FOR ME THE ABUSE OF ANIMALS IS IMMORAL
REMOVED
I DROPPED OUT OF PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE OF DISCUSSIONS LIKE THIS YOU CAN GO ON FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE ARGUING POINTS AND ALWAYS COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT PEOPLE THINK DIFFERENTLY TO NOT JUST TOTALLY BASH YOUR POST AND LEAVE YOU WITH NOTHING I BELIEVE AN ARGUMENT CAN BE MADE THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY SEE ABUSING ANIMALS AS A VIOLATION OF AN UNSPOKEN INTERSPECIES SOCIAL CONTRACT
THIS QUESTION IS ONE THAT HAS ALWAYS IRKED ME SINCE I HAVE NO JUSTIFIABLE ARGUMENT FOR MY POSITION I'VE ENCOUNTERED PEOPLE WHO ARE VEGAN IN THE WORST WAY IMAGINABLE THAT IS TO SAY BEATING YOU OVER THE HEAD WITH THEIR MORALS AND SO WHATEVER MERIT THEIR STANCE HAD HAS BEEN LOST TO ME WHENEVER THEY'D TALK ABOUT ANIMAL CRUELTY AND SUCH

I HAD HEARD OF THE STATEMENT THAT ANY CREATURE CAPABLE OF FEELING PAIN AND PLEASURE IS THEREFORE WORTHY OF MORAL TREATMENT BY THAT STATEMENT I FIGURED KILLING OR HARMING ANY CREATURE IS BAD WHICH SEEMED WRONG TO ME SO I WONDERED HOW COULD TREATING ONE TYPE OF ANIMAL DIFFERENTLY FROM ANOTHER BE JUSTIFIED AND I WONDER IF MAYBE IT'S INHERENTLY WRONG TO VIEW ANIMALS ON OUR TERMS SURELY THEY DON'T BOTHER WITH MORALITY THE WAY WE DO AND WHILE A LARGE PART OF THEIR LIVES ARE INSTINCTS THEY SHOW THEY ARE SENTIENT THROUGH THEIR BEHAVIORS BUT SINCE THEY'RE PARTS OF NATURE THEY'RE PART OF A FOOD CHAIN OF PREDATORS AND PREY AND FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE WOULDN'T WE BE PREDATORS TO THEM BUT I SUPPOSE WHAT BREAKS THE FOOD CHAIN IS FACTORY FARMING ON OUR PART SINCE IT'S IN A WAY REDUCING AN ANIMAL TO A LUMP OF MEAT AND RESOURCES SO MAYBE IT'D BE OKAY IF ANIMALS WERE GIVEN MORE COMFORT BEFORE BEING KILLED BECAUSE IT SHOWS MORE RESPECT TOWARDS THEM BUT THE ANIMALS DON'T CARE FOR RESPECT SO

I KNOW MY ARGUMENT ISN'T REALLY AN ARGUMENT IN ANY WAY AND IT'S A MESS BUT MY STANCE ON IT IS THAT IF GIVEN THE CHOICE TO STOP EATING MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS TO REPLACE THEM WITH ALTERNATIVES I WOULDN'T GIVE THAT UP I WANT MEAT AS PART OF MY DIET
SO THIS ISN'T ABOUT FARMER LATE NIGHT VISITS TO THE SHEEP PEN
GUESS IT'S BACK TO PENTHOUSE FORUM TONIGHT
YOU KNOW ANIMALS ARE CONSCIOUS HOW WHERE IS THE SCIENCE
I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS ARTICLE BUT ULTIMATELY I JUST FOUND IT DISAPPOINTING FORSTER DOES A GOOD JOB AT EXPLAINING HOW THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE INTEGRATIVE CONCEPTIONS BUT I DON'T THINK HE MADE A CONVINCING CASE FOR WHY THESE OTHER CONCEPTIONS ARE ITERATIVE CONCEPTIONS OF SET

CONSIDER CANTOR'S DEFINITION FROM

BY A SET WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND ANY COLLECTION M OF DEFINITE OBJECTS OF OUR INTUITION OR OUR THOUGHT INTO A WHOLE

IN LASSO IMAGERY THIS IS EXACTLY THE FIRST WAND THE OBJECTS COME FROM THE LASSO AND THE WAND WHICH MAKES THEM A SET IS THIS CONSIDERATION OF THEM AS A UNITY SO IT'S QUITE NATURAL TO CALL THE OBJECTS GENERATED BY ITERATING THIS PROCESS SETS

ONE THE OTHER HAND IF WE DO SOMETHING TO THE THINGS IN THE LASSO WHICH IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN CONSIDERING THEM AS A UNITY WHY SHOULD WE EXPECT WHAT WE GET TO BE SETS FOR INSTANCE A SECOND WAND COULD BE TO TAKE A LASSO WITH TWO ELEMENTS AND FORM THEIR ORDERED PAIR MORE GENERALLY WE COULD HAVE WANDS WHICH GIVE LISTS MULTISECT AND THE OTHER COLLECTIONS FROM COMPUTING FORSTER MENTIONS IN SECTION AS THINGS WHICH ARE NOT SETS SO WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT THAT ANY SELECTION OF WANDS WILL PRODUCE OBJECTS THAT WE CAN FAITHFULLY CALL SETS

OF COURSE SOME WANDS MAY PRODUCE SETS BUT WHY DO WE THINK THE RESULTING OBJECTS ARE SETS IS IT BECAUSE WE TRUST THAT WAND OR BECAUSE WE COULD PRODUCE THE SAME OBJECTS BY WAY OF THE CANTORIAN WAND IF THE OBJECTS CAN'T COME FROM THE CANTORIAN WAND WE NEED A REASON TO THINK THAT THE WAND THEY COME FROM REALLY DOES WORK AS ADVERTISED

BUT FORSTER DOESN'T GIVE A REASON WHY HIS SECOND WAND THE COMPLEMENT WAND PRODUCES SETS AT LEAST TO ME IT DOESN'T SEEM TO FOLLOW FROM THE CANTORIAN VIEW THIS WAND DOESN'T PACKAGE A MULTIPLICITY INTO A UNITY BUT RATHER CREATES A UNITY FROM THE AMBIENT UNIVERSE BY TAKING EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT PART OF THE MULTIPLICITY IT SEEMS TO RELY UPON THE AMBIENT UNIVERSE ALREADY BEING THERE AS AN OBJECT WE HAVE ACCESS TO BUT THIS AMBIENT UNIVERSE IS THE ABSOLUTE INFINITE THAT WHICH WE CANNOT TAKE AS A UNITY
ABSTRACT

THE TWO EXPRESSIONS THE CUMULATIVE HIERARCHY AND THE ITERATIVE CONCEPTION OF SETS
ARE USUALLY TAKEN TO BE SYNONYMOUS HOWEVER THE SECOND IS MORE GENERAL THAN THE FIRST IN THAT THERE
ARE RECURSIVE PROCEDURES THAT GENERATE SOME ILL-FOUNDED SETS IN ADDITION TO WELL-FOUNDED SETS THE
INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THE MORE RESTRICTIVE VERSION THE
CUMULATIVE HIERARCHY WERE ALL ALONG ARGUMENTS FOR THE MORE GENERAL VERSION

PHILOSOPHICAL CONFUTATION OF THE CONCEIVABILITY OF HUMANLIKE ZOMBIES POINT OUT THAT HAS NO SENSE TO CLAIM THAT A CREATURE THAT CAN ACCESS AND MANIPULATE ITS INTERIORITY LIKE WE DO CAN MISS SUBJECTIVITY

THIS IS THE WORST SENTENCE EVER MAYBE HAVE A LOOK AT THIS LECTURE ON WRITING STYLE
DELETED
THE PHILOSOPHICAL ZOMBIE SEEMS TO ME A RATS NEST OF ARGUMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS COHERENTLY WITHOUT A REASON FOR WHY ONE IS INVOKING THE CONCEPT ARGUING FOR AGAINST DUALISM ARGUING FOR AGAINST QUALIA DEBATING THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR SELF-AWARENESS ALL CLOSELY RELATED BUT THE PARTICULARS MATTER
AS AN ASIDE YOU SHOULD HAVE A NATIVE SPEAKER OF ENGLISH GO THROUGH YOUR TEXT AND OFFER SUGGESTIONS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POORLY FORMED SENTENCES AND INCORRECT WORDS THAT MAKE UNDERSTANDING DIFFICULT
PAULO COELHO IS A PHILOSOPHICAL ZOMBIE
OP I THINK YOU MEAN TO HAVE INDISTINGUISHABILITY IN YOUR ABSTRACT UNLESS I'M READING IT WRONG YOU'VE GOT THE ADVERB FORM WHERE YOU WANT THE NOUN

EDIT LIKE THE OTHER GUY SAID A ROUND OF EDITING BY A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA
BOOKMAKING THIS TO FINISH READING AND GIVE YOU FEEDBACK I THINK THAT YOUR ENGLISH ISN'T BAD AT ALL FOR SUCH A COMPLEX TOPIC
THE ONLY CONSCIOUSNESS A PERSON CAN KNOW EXISTS IS THEIR OWN BECAUSE THE ONLY QUALIA A PERSON HAS IS THEIR OWN THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS YES BUT I'M SAYING IT BECAUSE IT IS THE MAJOR REASON SPECULATION OF THESE THINGS IS A LITTLE SILLY WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MOVE PAST SPECULATION ON THIS SUBJECT

AND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT ZOMBIES ARE SCARY
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HUMANLIKE ZOMBIE AND A PERSON SEEMS TO BE THAT WHILE A PERSON HAS A STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS A ZOMBIE WOULD HAVE A STREAM OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HOWEVER SINCE THIS DIFFERENCE DOES NOT MAKE REAL DIFFERENCE WE HAD TO CONCLUDE THAT HUMANS AND THEIR ZOMBIE VERSIONS ARE THE SAME THING

YOU LOST ME RIGHT HERE THIS DIFFERENCE DOES NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT IS NOT THERE IT JUST MEANS THE OUTSIDE OBSERVER HAS NO WAY TO DISTINGUISH IT STREAM OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS IS A MEANINGLESS PHRASE TOO TO MAKE A ZOMBIE YOU WOULD NOT NEED ONE ANYWAY EXTREMELY GOOD AI SOFTWARE WOULD SUFFICE ON THE PHONE EVEN AN ANSWERING MACHINE COULD BE A ZOMBIE FOR A FEW SECONDS IF IT JUST HAPPENS TO SAY THE THINGS YOU WOULD EXPECT A LIVING PERSON TO SAY
ABSTRACT

WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF EXPRESSION IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY TENSE MASCULINE SCANLON ADDRESSES THIS QUESTION IN THIS BONUS EPISODE WHICH WAS PRODUCED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE OPEN UNIVERSITY AND ORIGINALLY APPEARED ON ETHICS BITES A TRANSCRIPT OF THIS INTERVIEW IS AVAILABLE FROM ETHICSBITES

INTERVIEWEE

PHILOSOPHY BITES IS A GREAT SERVICE BUT IS UNFORTUNATELY RUN ENTIRELY ON DONATIONS YOU CAN DONATE VIA PALPAL ON THE LEFT SIDEBAR OF THE PHILOSOPHY BITES SITE OR YOU CAN DONATE MONTHLY VIA THEIR PATRON PAGE
I'M IN STRONG AGREEMENT WITH SCANLON THAT LAWS AGAINST RACIAL HATE SPEECH ARE A BAD IDEA BUT I CAN'T WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENDORSE THE DEFENSE HE GIVES OF THAT POSITION LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO ATTEMPT TO DEFEND PERMISSIVE VIEWS ON FREE SPEECH HE FALLS INTO THE TRAP OF GIVING A UTILITARIAN ARGUMENT THAT NEVER SOUNDS QUITE CONVINCING SCANLON HIMSELF SEEMS TO RECOGNIZE THIS SINCE HE POINTS OUT THAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE LAWS AGAINST RACIAL HATE SPEECH AND THEY DON'T SEEM WORSE OFF FOR IT HIS POINT THAT TOLERATION FOR GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS ON SPEECH MAY LEAD TO TOLERATION FOR GOVERNMENT SECRECY IS AN INTERESTING ONE BUT IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DEMONSTRATE EMPIRICALLY THAT A THIS ATTITUDE IS PREVALENT TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE IN THE COUNTRIES IN QUESTION AND B THERE'S A LINK BETWEEN THIS ATTITUDE AND HATE SPEECH LAWS

I THINK THAT THE FREE SPEECH ADVOCATES SHOULD DIRECT THE CONVERSATION AWAY FROM UTILITARIAN ARGUMENTS REGARDING THE PUBLIC GOOD RATHER IT SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO FOCUS ON THE RIGHTS AND AUTONOMY OF THE SPEAKER AN ANGLE THAT I THINK SCANLON WAS TOO DISMISSIVE OF AT THE START OF THE PODCAST PEOPLE JUST DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES BECAUSE FREEDOM IS A GOOD THING AND THIS RIGHT CAN ONLY BE ABRIDGED ONCE A VERY HIGH BURDEN OF PROOF HAS BEEN MET FOR EXAMPLE IF A BLACK PERSON COMES TO HATE WHITE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF WHAT HE PERCEIVES AS SYSTEMIC INJUSTICES IN THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM THEN IT JUST SEEMS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT A HE HAS THE RIGHT TO HATE WHITE PEOPLE B HE HAS THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS THIS HATRED AND C THESE RIGHTS CAN ONLY BE RESTRICTED IF THEIR EXERCISE WOULD CAUSE SEVERE HARM THIS IS A VERY ROUGH CONDITION THAT UNDOUBTEDLY NEEDS WORK BUT HOPEFULLY IT GETS MY POINT ACROSS ALLOWING HIM TO EXPRESS HIS HATRED MAY LEAD TO MORE HATRED AND EVEN VIOLENCE YES BUT THE MERE POSSIBILITY OF THESE THINGS IS NOT ENOUGH TO OUTWEIGH THE RIGHTS OF THE SPEAKER

ANOTHER PERHAPS MORE UTILITARIAN ANGLE TO CONSIDER IS THE SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS THAT HATE SPEECH LAWS HAVE ON SPEAKERS A SOCIETY THAT MAKES IT ILLEGAL FOR YOU TO EXPRESS YOUR MOST POLITICAL CONVICTIONS IS GOING TO FEEL HIGHLY ALIENATING AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FEELING THAT WAY SHOULD ALWAYS BE FACTORED INTO OUR MORAL CALCULATIONS ALTHOUGH THIS RESPONSIBILITY CAN OF COURSE BE OUTWEIGHED BY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS DUE TO SOCIAL AND LEGAL ISOLATION CERTAIN PEOPLE MAY BE PUSHED AWAY FROM OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE THAT MAY ALLEVIATE THE ORIGINAL TENSIONS

SIMILAR ARGUMENTS CAN BE APPLIED TO THE QUESTION OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN AND PUBLISHING PORNOGRAPHY
INTERESTING VIDEO ON THIS TOPIC I'M OF THE MIND THAT FUNDAMENTALLY THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE DRAWS FOR THIS THOUGHT PROBLEM IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF LABELLING AND IDENTIFICATION AND THE INNATE HUMAN DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO DO SO THE ANSWER THAT ONE DRAWS IS DEPENDENT UPON HOW ONE DEFINES THESE VARIOUS ENTITIES AND HOW THE VARIOUS PARTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE WHOLE

YOU REASSEMBLE A NEW SHIP COMPLETELY OUT OF ALL OF THE PARTS OF THE OLD ONE IS IT THE SAME SHIP IN TERMS OF ACTUAL PHYSICAL COMPOSITION ASSUMING CONSISTENCY IT MOST CERTAINLY IS HOWEVER WHO'S TO SAY IT'S NOT A NEW SHIP EXTERNAL FACTORS OTHER THAN THE SHIP ITSELF ARE IN FLUX AND CAN EASILY RESULT IN THE NEW SHIP AS BEING AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE ENTITY FROM THE OLD THIS IS SIMILARLY THE CASE FOR THE OTHER RENDITIONS OF THIS PROBLEM ONE IS ESSENTIALLY ATTEMPTING TO DECIDE WITHIN THEMSELVES HOW THEY LABEL AND IDENTIFY THINGS

ADDITIONALLY THE SHIP PROBLEM IS AN ISSUE OF EMERGENT PROPERTIES THE WHOLE BEING GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS INDIVIDUAL PARTS WHETHER THE SHIP AND WHAT IT SIGNIFIES IS ITS OWN ENTITY OR MERELY THE SUM OF ITS INDIVIDUAL PARTS IS ULTIMATELY IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER

AS THERE IS NO VIEW FROM NOWHERE THE SHIP PROBLEM REMAINS MORE OR LESS UNSOLVABLE DUE TO A LACK OF OBJECTIVE TRUTHS REQUIRED TO ANSWER IT




WHY IS THIS CALLED THE SHIP OF THESEUS

I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE BUT ALWAYS WONDERED BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REFERENCE TO THIS ABOUT HIS VOYAGE TO AND FROM CRETE AND IF SO HOW DOES THE REBUILDING OF THE SHIP PART FIT IN I THOUGHT THE ONLY SIGNIFICANCE THE SHIP HAS IN THAT TALE WAS THE MISTAKE ABOUT NOT CHANGING THE COLOR OF THE SAILS

IS IT STRICTLY HYPOTHETICAL AND JUST USING THESEUS ACHILLES AS POPULAR CHARACTERS OR IS THIS ACTUALLY A SITUATION PLAYED OUT IN THE MYTHOS
I WISH PHILOSOPHERS WOULD STOP CALLING THINGS THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE NO FEATURES OF ACTUAL EXPERIMENTS IN THIS CASE IT'S SIMPLY AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY IDENTITY WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING SUBJECT TO EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG NO WAY TO DISPROVE WHAT YOU CLAIM SIMILARLY AVICENNA AND THE WHOLE ROOM THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS ARE SIMPLY STATEMENTS OF UNSUPPORTED OPINION WITHOUT ANY EXPERIMENT PROPOSED

THAT SAID THIS VIDEO TRIES TO TREAT IDENTITY AS A PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE SHIP AND THAT'S WHERE THE QUESTIONS ARISE BECAUSE IT IS NOT A PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE SHIP INDEED YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT IN THE NAME OF THE QUESTION SHIP OF THESEUS THESEUS TAKES APART HIS SHIP ONE BOARD AT A TIME PUTTING THEM IN A PILE WHILE HE REPLACES THE BOARDS WITH NEW ONES ACHILLES THEN COMES ALONG AND BUILDS A SHIP OUT OF THE OLD BOARDS THE FIRST SHIP IS THE SHIP OF THESEUS AND THE SECOND IS THE SHIP OF ACHILLES YES OWNERSHIP BUT THERE IS NO THE SHIP IF YOU DON'T CONSIDER WHO IS ASKING AND WHY THERE'S JUST A BUNCH OF BOARDS THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING DISTINCT FROM A BUNCH OF OTHER BOARDS AND THE OPINION OF THOSE PEOPLE IS THE OPINION THAT MATTERS
HERE IS MY ADMITTEDLY SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY HALF-BAKED TAKE

THE IDENTITY SHIP OF THESEUS IS TIED TO 2 CONDITIONS AS A DIMENSIONAL OBJECT

RELATION TO THESEUS MAYBE HE BUILD IT IS THE CAPTAIN THE SHIP IS NAMED AFTER HIM

FUNCTION AS A SHIP IT MUST FLOAT HOLD PASSENGERS CARGO AND IT MUST BE ABLE TO TRAVEL

THE IDENTITY BEGINS WHEN THE RELATION IS ESTABLISHED THROUGH COMPLETING THE CONSTRUCTION CONSENSUS SYMBOLIC ACTION OF DESIGNATING THE CAPTAIN CHRISTENING THE SHIP

THE IDENTITY ENDS WHEN IT NO LONGER FUNCTIONS AS A SHIP OR THE RELATION TO THESEUS IS REVOKED RENAMING CHANGING THE CAPTAIN

TO ALL THE PART SHUFFLING QUESTIONS RAISED IN THE VIDEO IF IT BREAKS IT ENDS THE IDENTITY

IF I TAKE SHIPS APART AND REASSEMBLE IT IT A NEW IDENTITY REASSEMBLED SHIP OF THESEUS IT NOW HAS 2 RELATIONS THE ONE TO THESEUS AND THE ONE TO ME THE IDENTITY IS NEW AND DISTINCT BUT IT INCLUDES LINEAGE

IF I JUST REPAIR THE SHIP WITHOUT INTERRUPTING FUNCTIONALITY THE IDENTITY REMAINS ORIGINAL IF WE LOOK AT THE DIMENSION TIME THEN THE REPAIR IS PART OF WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SHIP OF THESEUS

IF IT'S A RAGING TORRENT OF PARTS THAT TEMPORARILY APPEARS AS ASSEMBLED SHIP WELL THEN IT'S A HAUNTED GHOST SHIP OF THESEUS HAUNTED GHOST IS FOR WHAT EVER CAUSES THE PARTS TO RAGE AROUND IN A TORRENT


RELATING THE SHIP OF THESEUS TO THE HUMAN MIND IT SADDENS ME TO THINK THAT IT IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO UPLOAD OUR CONSCIOUSNESS TO ANOTHER OBJECT BE IT ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPUTER IN THE FUTURE OR TO TELEPORT PEOPLE FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER WHILE MAINTAINING THE CONTINUITY FOR THE ORIGINAL PERSON ANY PROCESS THAT MAKES A COPY OF THE PERSON WOULD APPEAR TO WORK FOR THE COPY BUT APPEAR TO NOT HAVE WORKED FOR THE ORIGINAL ANY PROCESS THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE A COPY WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL AND THE RECREATION AT THE OTHER END BREAKING THE CONTINUITY OF THE MIND AND POTENTIALLY MEANING THE DEATH OF THE ORIGINAL

THINGS LIKE THE TRANSPORTER IN STARTREK WOULD BE MORE SIMILAR TO THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE THE ILLUSIONIST I DON'T THINK THERE IS A WAY WE COULD DEVISE THAT WOULD MAINTAIN CONTINUITY FROM THE ORIGINAL TO THE NEW ENTITY AND THERE WOULDN'T BE A WAY TO TELL BECAUSE THE COPY WOULD HAVE ALL THE MEMORIES OF THE ORIGINAL IT IS SOMETHING I THINK ABOUT A LOT AND I HAVEN'T YET BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH ANY PROCESS BY WHICH THE ORIGINAL WOULD BE PRESERVED
THE SHIP OF THESEUS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS NOT SO MUCH A CHALLENGE TO THE VERY CONCEPT OF PERSONAL IDENTITY BUT TO THE NOTION THAT PERSONAL IDENTITY IS TIED TO MATTER IN ITSELF

THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT SHOWS THE IDENTITY OF THINGS ARE OF THE FORM OF MATTER I E THE STRUCTURE THAT MATTER TAKES
IDENTITY DEPENDS ON THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH WE ARE IDENTIFYING THE OBJECT AS WITH SO MUCH OF PHILOSOPHY THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT ABOUT REALITY BUT WHAT WE SOMEWHAT ARBITRARILY CHOOSE TO CALL THINGS

AN ARCHIMEDES SCREW NEED NOT BELONG TO OR HAVE BEEN MADE BY ARCHIMEDES BUT MAY MERELY BE SIMILAR TO THE ONE HE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED

THE PRICE OF A DALI PAINTING DEPENDS CRITICALLY ON WHETHER IT WAS ACTUALLY PAINTED BY HAND OR WHETHER IT'S AN EXCELLENT COPY OR A PRINTING

IF THE SHIP OF THESEUS IS TO BE USED AS AN OBJECT OF VENERATION THEN IT WILL HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT VALUE IF THESEUS DIDN'T ACTUALLY TOUCH IT IF IT'S TO BE USED MERELY TO HAUL CARGO AUTHENTICITY TAKES SECOND PLACE TO UTILITY

FOR MANY OBJECTS OF VENERATION LIKE BONES OF SAINTS AND NAILS OF THE CROSS THE REAL EG DNA IDENTITY DOESN'T REALLY MATTER SO LONG AS THE WORSHIPPERS BELIEVE THE CLAIMS OF IDENTITY
LOVE WILLIAMS HIS ESSAY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL REASONS CHANGED THE WAY I VIEW MORALITY
HABERMAN SAYS I T MUST BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT PARTICIPANTS IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS TO DROP THE ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SUBJECT THE COMBINATION OF FACTICITY AND VALIDITY REQUIRES A PROCESS OF IN WHICH THE PARTICIPATORY CITIZENS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO
TAKE PART SIMPLY IN THE ROLE OF ACTORS ORIENTED TO SUCCESS BUT WHAT IS THIS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO IT CANNOT BE BLANKLY NORMATIVE SUPPOSE ONE IS BOUND TO SAY THAT THEY DO IT MAY BE REPLIED IT WILL DEFEAT THE POINT BUT WHAT IF IT DOES AND HOW CAN WE BE SURE IN THE LIGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY WHAT THE POINT REALLY IS IT MAY BE SAID ALTERNATIVELY IT CANNOT WORK IN OTHER WORDS THE SYSTEM WILL BREAK DOWN AND THE POLITICAL PROCESS WILL BEGIN TO LOSE SIGNIFICANCE IN RELATION TO OTHER ACTIVITIES AND THE LIFE WORLD I WANT TO SAY AT THIS POINT TWO THINGS IF THAT IS SO THEN IT WILL SHOW ITSELF AND WE SHALL HAVE A MANIFEST SOCIAL OR POLITICAL PROBLEM FOR WHICH WE SHALL HAVE TO MOBILIZE IDEAS WHICH ALREADY MAKE SENSE MS TO THE PUBLIC AND MIGHT MOVE TOWARD POSSIBLE POLITICAL ACTION SECOND IT WILL BE ONLY ONE OF MANY CONFLICTS ABOUT WHAT THE PROCESSES OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION CAN BE HOPED TO YIELD UNDER CONDITIONS OF MODERNITY THERE ARE NEEDS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHICH SEEMINGLY CAN BE MET ONLY BY MORE DIRECTLY PARTICIPATORY STRUCTURES BUT EQUALLY THERE ARE OBJECTIVES WHICH ARE NOTORIOUSLY FRUSTRATED BY THESE AND OTHER AIMS WHICH ARE AT LEAST IN COMPETITION WITH THEM AND
CONSIDERATIONS WHICH RAISE DOUBTS ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY PROCEDURES CAN BE REALLY PARTICIPATORY ANYWAY NO TRANSCENDENTAL OR PARTLY TRANSCENDENTAL ARGUMENT ONE MIGHT SAY MORE GENERALLY THEORETICAL ARGUMENT COULD SERVE TO RESOLVE THESE CONFLICTS

BRILLIANT THIS PIECE AND WORK IN GENERAL FUNDAMENTALLY RECONFIGURES WHAT IT MEANS FOR POLITICAL THEORY PHILOSOPHY TO PROVIDE POLITICAL GUIDANCE
THIS GUY IS GREAT HE REALLY OPENED UP MY EYES IN A SMALL TIME FRAME DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND WATCH THE WHOLE THING IF YOU WANT A GOOD LAUGH AND SOME ADVICE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH LIFE A LITTLE BETTER
FROM THE APOLOGIA

A SKIING INSTRUCTOR DOES NOT JUST SAY YOU VE SEEN PEOPLE SKI WELL NOW DO IT YOURSELF GO ON SKI RATHER THE INSTRUCTOR GIVES YOU SKIING HEURISTICS BREAKING DOWN SKIING INTO MANAGEABLE BITS SHIFT YOUR WEIGHT TO THE DOWNHILL SKI KEEP YOUR HANDS FORWARD AND SO ON YET IN PHILOSOPHY WE TYPICALLY JUST SHOW OUR STUDENTS FINISHED PIECES OF PHILOSOPHY THE CLASSICS THE RECENT LITERATURE AND THEN EFFECTIVELY SAY YOU VE SEEN PEOPLE PHILOSOPHIZE WELL NOW DO IT YOURSELVES GO ON PHILOSOPHIZE I THOUGHT WE COULD DO BETTER

SO I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT IDENTIFYING MANAGEABLE TECHNIQUES IN THESE PHILOSOPHICAL SHOWPIECES TO BE SURE THE TEACHING OF SUCH HEURISTICS WAS A TINY PART OF MY COURSES THEY CAME MORE AS QUICK ASIDES AS WE READ THROUGH THE CLASSICS OR THE RECENT LITERATURE HERE HUME IS USING THE PROVES TOO MUCH STRATEGY OR WHAT HAVE YOU BUT POINTING OUT THE HEURISTICS AS THEY SHOWED UP ALONG THE WAY WAS CERTAINLY VALUABLE AND IT WAS FUN

I THINK THIS IS RIGHT I LIKE THE SWISS ARMY KNIFE THEORY BETTER BUT ACTUALLY SAID SWISS ARMY KNIFE APPROACH FITS BROADER THEME IN HIS WORK OF UNIVERSAL HUMAN TRAITS THEN SUPPORTING UNIVERSAL VALUES AND JUSTICE AS FAIRNESS ETC AS OPPOSED TO THE LINGUISTIC THEORY THAT EVERYTHING IS PURELY CULTURAL AND AFFECTED AND RELATIVE
IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE THEY ARE EXPLAINING THE DETAILS OF LANGUAGE ACQUISITION DEVICE RATHER THAN REFUTING THAT IT EXISTS IF I SHOW YOU A CAR AND SAY SOMEWHERE IN THERE IS THE THING THAT MAKES IT GO ALL CARS HAVE ONE AND THEN LATER YOU SHOW ME HOW THE ENGINE WORKS YOU DIDN'T PROVE ME WRONG YOU JUST EXPLAINED HOW THE GO DEVICE WORKS
REBUTTAL
ASSUMING THIS IS PROVEN TRUE IT MUST SUCK TO HAVE YOUR ENTIRE LEGACY COPED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN THE TWILIGHT OF YOUR CAREER
I DON'T GET WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SO ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT DEFENDING THEORY THEORY MAKES VAST ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE WAY THE HUMAN BRAIN FUNCTIONS THAT WERE TOTALLY UNGROUNDED AT THE TIME OF HIS WORK AND ARE STILL DIFFICULT TO PROVE OR DISPROVE WITH THE IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE BRAIN

WHILE THE THEORY WAS OSTENSIBLY BASED ON UNIVERSAL FEATURES OF ALL LANGUAGES IT SOON BECAME CLEAR THAT THERE WERE LANGUAGES CHOMSKY WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT DID NOT ABIDE BY THESE FEATURES LEADING TO APPARENTLY HAPHAZARD REVISIONS

EVEN IF CHOMSKY TURNS OUT TO BE RIGHT WHICH APPEARS INCREASINGLY UNLIKELY I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE THAT UNREASONABLE TO SAY THAT IT WAS JUST A LUCKY GUESS THE EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENTS THAT CHOMSKY USED TO BUILD HIS THEORY HAVE NOT STOOD UP TO FURTHER RESEARCH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE COINCIDENTALLY HAPPENS TO BE A GRAIN OF TRUTH IN HIS WORK AT THIS TIME THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE ARGUMENT THAT THE WAY CHILDREN LEARN GRAMMAR IS LARGELY SIMILAR TO THE WAY THEY LEARN VOCABULARY THEY START WITH MIMICRY ARE CORRECTED BY ADULTS AND GRADUALLY LEARN THE RULES UNDERLYING PHRASES BASED ON WHEN THEY ARE AND ARE NOT CORRECTED
WAIT REDDIN SHOWS NOW IS THAT RES OR SHINE
THE ARABIC WRITING ON THE FRONT OF THE MOSQUE LOOKS LIKE المسجد ALMASJID OR MOSQUE

I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

READ THE POST BEFORE YOU REPLY

READ THE POSTED CONTENT UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS GIVEN AND RESPOND TO THESE SUBSTANTIVELY IF YOU HAVE UNRELATED THOUGHTS OR DON'T WISH TO READ THE CONTENT PLEASE POST YOUR OWN THREAD OR SIMPLY REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING COMMENTS WHICH ARE CLEARLY NOT IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE POSTED CONTENT MAY BE REMOVED

THIS SUB IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TANGENTIAL ANECDOTES OR DANK MEMES EXPECT COMMENT THREADS THAT BREAK OUR RULES TO BE REMOVED
GREAT ARTICLE THANKS FOR POSTING HERE ARE TWO THOUGHTS

FIRST YOU MIGHT SAY IT DOESN T MATTER WHETHER I LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE I SHOULDN T
PARTICIPATE IN A MORALLY CORRUPT ENTERPRISE REGARDLESS OF THE ANALYSIS OF MY
PARTICIPATION IF I ATE MEAT I D BE BENEFITING FROM THE CRUELTY OF FACTORY FARMING I D HAVE DIRTY
HANDS SO I SHOULDN T DO IT IF THIS LINE OF THOUGHT SOUNDS TOO HIGH-MINDED CONSIDER A DIFFERENT
EXAMPLE SUPPOSE THAT SOMEONE YOU KNOW A CHARMING BUT SKETCHY CHARACTER HAS JUST MUGGED
AN OLD WOMAN FOR NOW HE WANTS TO TREAT YOU TO DINNER SHOULD YOU ACCEPT WHY NOT HAVE
A GOOD MEAL BEFORE CALLING THE COPS COMMON SENSE SAYS DON T DO IT DON T BECOME A PART OF
THE MUGGING EVEN AFTER THE FACT THESE TWO EXAMPLES ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME IN EACH YOU TAKE
A PRINCIPLED STAND YOU SIMPLY REFUSE TO BENEFIT FROM EVIL TO ENJOY INDUSTRIAL MEAT OR THE
SPOILS OF A MUGGING WOULD COMPROMISE YOUR MORAL INTEGRITY IT WOULD STAIN YOUR SOUL
AS A UTILITARIAN I REJECT THIS WAY OF FILLING IN THE ARGUMENT I DON T BELIEVE THAT IT S
INTRINSICALLY GOOD TO OPT OUT OF IMMORAL ENTERPRISES I WOULD ASSESS MY PARTICIPATION BASED ON ITS
PROBABLE EFFECTS HOWEVER I DO ADMIRE THE DESIRE TO DISASSOCIATE ONE S SELF FROM EVIL
UNCONDITIONALLY PEOPLE WHO TAKE A PRINCIPLED STAND AGAINST INDUSTRIAL FARMING SET A GOOD AND
UNAMBIGUOUS EXAMPLE TO THEIR NEIGHBORS ALSO THEIR UNCOMPROMISING ATTITUDE MAKES THEM
ESPECIALLY UNLIKELY TO BACKSLIDE

THIS IS THE BIGGEST REASON I SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GO VEGAN IT'S SO MUCH LESS ABOUT THE EFFECT THAT YOU HAVE AS AN INDIVIDUAL IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT THE EFFECT THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR IMMEDIATE SOCIAL CIRCLE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT UP THINKING THAT VEGANISM IS HARD NOT TASTY OR UNHEALTHY BUT LIVING AS A HEALTHY HAPPY VEGAN WHO EATS AWESOME FOOD AND LEADING BY EXAMPLE IS THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO TO SWAY THE MINDS OF THOSE AROUND YOU

THE ARTICLE MIGHT BE A BIT MISLEADING IN HOW IT USES THE WORD VEGETARIANISM CONSTANTLY BUT ONLY MENTIONS VEGANISM A FEW TIMES HE IS FAIRLY CLEAR IN THE ARTICLE THAT EGGS AND DAIRY ARE SIMILARLY AS BAD AS MEAT BUT ODDS ARE THAT MOST UNCRITICAL READERS WILL SCAN THE ARTICLE AND THINK THAT EGGS AND DAIRY ARE OKAY A GOOD CONSEQUENTIALIST SHOULD ALWAYS BE PREPARED FOR POTENTIAL AND OFTEN INTENTIONAL MISINTERPRETATIONS HELL A GOOD WRITER OF ANY SORT SHOULD BE

REMOVED
I JUST HUNT AND EAT FREE RANGE BUT OKAY
THE DISCOMFORT ANIMALS ENDURE IN ADMITTEDLY TERRIBLE INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES IS PERHAPS WORSE THAN THE SENSE OF PREDATION THEY FELT IN THE WILD BUT THE LATTER IS I EAST THE AVERAGE COW MAY HAVE A WORSE QUALITY OF LIFE THAN IT'S GREAT GRANDFATHER DID BUT CATTLE WERE NEVER DOMINANT IN THEIR ECOSYSTEMS THE THREAT OF PREDATION WAS ALWAYS THERE AND ANIMALS WERE LIKELY AGITATED IF THEY SPOTTED A WOLF IN THE WILD
THIS ARGUMENT DOESN'T GIVE US CARTE BLANCHE TO DO WHAT WE PLEASE BUT IT DOES REMIND US THAT THERE IS A BASELINE QUALITY OF LIFE WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHEN TALKING ABOUT ANIMAL ETHICS
REMOVED
THIS ARTICLE WILL GET A LOT OF HOSTILE ATTENTION NOT BECAUSE ITS CONTENT OR MESSAGE PER SE BUT BECAUSE OF HOW IT'S WRITTEN IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY REAL PERSUASIVE IMPACT ON THE READER NOT BEING PERSUASIVE IS ONE OF THE WORST OUTCOMES OF A PERSUASIVE PAPER

NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE INTRODUCTION IS LIKE
INDUSTRIAL FARMING IS ABUSIVE TO ANIMALS

WOW INSPIRING WITHOUT PAGES COULD IT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE DESCRIPTIVE HERE JUST THOUGHT OF THIS AS AN ALTERNATIVE
INDUSTRIAL FARMING IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH ANIMAL PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED ON A MASSIVE SCALE THIS PROCESS HAS A TENDENCY TO DEPRIVE ANIMALS OF THE BASIC RIGHTS TO SANITATION FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT AND DIGNITY THAT HUMANS ENJOY AS SUCH INDUSTRIAL FARMING IS ABUSIVE TO ANIMALS

NOW I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD MUCH ANY EXPERIENCE READING PHILOSOPHY PAPERS SO PERHAPS THE LAYOUT IS NOT WHAT I IMAGINE IT SHOULD BE BUT I'D DEFINITELY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I'M READING GRANTED THAT'S JUST A MINOR POINT ANYWAYS

MOVING ON THE ENTIRE FIRST SECTION OF THE PAPER ANIMAL CRUELTY ONLY TALKS ABOUT THAT IT ESSENTIALLY ONLY LISTS INCIDENTS OF CRUELTY FOR EACH OF A CERTAIN KIND OF LIVESTOCK FOR THE ENTIRE CHAPTER EXCEPT FOR ONE MENTION OF A SURVEY AT THE END IN FACT THIS HAMMERING OF IDEAS IS PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PAPER DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE TO SOMEONE ELSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS

SIMPLY SCAMMING POINTS DOESN'T MAKE YOUR VIEW MORE VALID WHAT ALSO DOESN'T HELP IS HOW RIDICULOUSLY ONE-SIDED RACHELS CITATIONS ARE OF THE SELECTED ARTICLES BOOKS WEBSITES AND DOCUMENTARIES I FOUND THAT I THOUGHT WERE EVEN REMOTELY UNBIASED

NOBODY LIKES TO BE INSULTED AND THE AUTHOR ISN'T PERSUADING ANYONE BY TELLING THEM THAT THEY'RE LITERALLY WORSE THAN HITLER THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WHOLLY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR ARE THE ONES WHO ALREADY WERE ON HIS SIDE IN THE FIRST PLACE AS FOR THE OTHERS THEY LIKELY READ THE FIRST PARAGRAPH REALIZED THAT THIS WAS THE RHETORIC FOR THE ENTIRE PAPER AND PROCEEDED TO SAVE A HALF-HOUR OF THEIR LIFE

BUT MAYBE HE HAS SOME GRAND SOLUTION TO ALL OF THIS AFTER ALL THAT'S WHAT THE PAPER WAS BUILDING UP TO RIGHT SOMETHING ABOUT COMPASSIONATE EATING
THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS FOR VEGETARIANISM ARE EASY THE DIFFICULT THING IS GETTING
PEOPLE TO STOP EATING MEAT

OH WHO WOULD OF THOUGHT


TL R ANY ARTICLE CAN TURN PEOPLE AWAY IF IT'S WRITTEN BADLY ENOUGH

EDIT I'D LIKE TO BRING UP THAT I THINK THAT INDUSTRIALIZED FARMING OF ANIMALS IS CRUEL THOUGH I'M NOT A VEGETARIAN BY ANY MEANS
IT IS WRONG TO CAUSE SUFFERING UNLESS THERE IS A GOOD REASON TO DO SO

THIS IS ALWAYS TAKEN AS AN AXIOMATIC TRUTH IN THESE ARGUMENTS WHY IS THIS THE CASE PAIN AND SUFFERING ARE DEFENSE MECHANISMS TRIGGERED TO HELP ANIMALS SURVIVE WHY IS AVOIDING THESE SPECIFIC TRIGGERS IN ANIMALS MORE IMPORTANT THAN TRIGGERING DEFENSE MECHANISM OF PLANTS INSECTS OR BACTERIA COULD IT BE THAT WE IRRATIONALLY FAVOR THINGS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OURSELVES
REMOVED
REMOVED
THE ARGUMENT FROM CAUTION IS A TERRIBLE ARGUMENT

KILLING ANIMALS MIGHT BE MURDER

SO KILLING ANIMALS TO OBTAIN FOOD IS WRONG

SO WE SHOULD BE VEGETARIANS

THE DEFENSE IN THE PIECE WAS THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK THEY KNOW WHETHER ANIMALS HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE HIGHLY DOUBTFUL WHAT'S FAR MORE LIKELY AND FAR MORE TO THE POINT IS THAT EATING MEAT IS GOOD FOR YOU AND WITHOUT VIABLE SUBSTITUTION IT IS A PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT FOREVER AND IS INTRINSIC TO BOTH INSTINCT AND CULTURE THAT IMMEDIATELY KNOCKS DOWN VERY FEW ISOLATED CULTURES HAVE EVER SUCCESSFULLY DROPPED MEAT CONSUMPTION AND ALMOST ALL ARE FOR IDEALISTIC RELIGIOUS BELIEFS UNRELATED TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE ANIMALS HOW MANY FOLLOWERS BELIEVED IN THE RULE TRULY BEING A DIFFERENT MATTER WORTH POINTING OUT
REMOVED
REMOVED

KILLING ANIMALS MIGHT BE MURDER
SO KILLING ANIMALS TO OBTAIN FOOD IS WRONG
SO WE SHOULD BE VEGETARIANS


C3 FROM ALLOWING CARNIVORES TO GO ABOUT KILLING INDISCRIMINATELY
IS WRONG JUST AS ALLOWING HOMICIDAL MASS MURDERS TO ROAM FREE AND DO THEIR THING

WE SHOULD NOT KILL ALL CARNIVORES BUT KEEP THEM ALL SECURE AND FEED THEM
ON NON MEAT SUBSTITUTES

THE ARGUMENT FOR EQUAL SPECIES RIGHTS MAKES THE ABOVE VALID IMO THE MORAL ARGUMENT WHICH IS TRICKY IS DO WE ALLOW MASS MURDERS AND TIGERS TO BREED IN CAPTIVITY OR NOT AND RELEASING A TIGER INTO THE WILD IS FROM THE ARGUMENT ABOVE NO DIFFERENT TO RELEASING A PSYCHOPATH

SUMMARY
WE HUMANS ARE A CHATTY TALK A LOT BUT EACH CLAIM WE MAKE CAN BE SORTED NEATLY SORTED INTO ONE OF TWO CATEGORIES IT EITHER DESCRIBES SOMETHING OR IT EVALUATES SOMETHING PHILOSOPHERS CALL THESE DESCRIPTIVE AND NORMATIVE CLAIMS RESPECTIVELY IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO KELLEY SCHIFFMAN YALE UNIVERSITY ILLUSTRATES THE DESCRIPTIVE NORMATIVE DISTINCTION AND IT'S IMPORTANCE WITH THE USE OF AMPLE EXAMPLES

THANKS FOR WATCHING IF YOU LIKE OUR VIDEOS PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL

WIPHI
DID ANYONE ELSE FIND THE I COULD USE MORE MONEY EXAMPLE AS A DESCRIPTIVE STATEMENT A LITTLE UNCLEAR AS AN INTRODUCTORY

ESPECIALLY IF NORMATIVE USE OUGHT
I COULD USE DOES SEEM PRETTY CLOSE TO OUGHT AS A TURN OF PHRASE
WHAT ABOUT DESCRIPTIVE CLAIMS THAT DISGUISE THEMSELVES AS NORMATIVE CLAIMS
MOSTLY TO RESPOND TO PEOPLE SAYING CHOMSKY IS A HACK OR THAT HIS THEORIES ARE BUNK I FIGURED PEOPLE OUGHT TO CHECK THIS STUFF OUT THEN DECIDE THE SUBSEQUENT PARTS SHOULD BE OF INTEREST ESPECIALLY TO ANYONE WHO LIKES TO THINK ABOUT PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE MIND AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE I THINK IN PART TWO OR THREE HE GOES INTO MORE DEPTH ABOUT HIS PARTICULAR VIEWS ABOUT NATURALISM AND WHAT IT MEANS WITH REGARD TO COGNITIVE SCIENCE HIS VIEW IS THAT CONTRARY TOW WHAT MOST CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHERS OF MIND AND LANGUAGE WOULD SAY THEIR PROGRAM IS RADICALLY UNNATURALISTIC ALTHOUGH THEY WOULD CONSTRUE WHAT THEY ARE DOING AS NATURALISM HIS ARGUMENT RESTS ON THE CLAIM THAT THEY EMPLOY A METHODOLOGICAL DUALISM BY TREATING THE MIND IN A COMPLETELY UNSCIENTIFIC MYSTICAL WAY

ANYWAYS IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE GONE THROUGH THEM SO MY CHARACTERIZATION MIGHT BE OFFICIAL MOSTLY I JUST WANT TO SPUR DISCUSSION SINCE THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF SENTIMENT THAT TREATS CHOMSKY AS IF HE IS HOPELESSLY BACKWARDS

BTW THE SOUND ISN'T GREAT BUT BEARABLE
WHILE THE VIDEO GIVES A PRETTY GOOD OVERVIEW OF VEIL OF IGNORANCE WHAT IT GETS WRONG IN MY OPINION IS THAT IT PRESENTS THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE AS THOUGH RAWLS DEVELOPED IT TO BE SOME SORT OF HEURISTIC TO HELP INDIVIDUALS MAKE POLITICAL DECISIONS WHEREAS IN HIS ACTUAL WORKS THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE SIMPLY FUNCTIONS AS A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE ORIGINAL POSITION IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A CONTRACTUAL FOUNDATION FOR POLITICAL SOCIETY WITHOUT THE SHORTCOMINGS OF PAST CONTRACT THEORIES SUCH AS HOBBES LOCKE AND ROUSSEAU
I LOVE THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE BUT THE FACT THAT WE NEED IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE DISHEARTENING TO ME IT BASICALLY TEACHES YOU TO HAVE EMPATHY AND IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL DO NOT PRACTICE EMPATHY ENOUGH THAT IT WARRANTS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THIS IDEA BUT STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW RAWLS ACCOUNTS FOR VARYING PREFERENCES FOR RISK TAKING

WOULD YOU RATHER LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE EVERYONE MAKES A YEAR OR ONE WHERE MAKE MAKE MIL AND ARE HOMELESS A CRUDE EXAMPLE I KNOW BUT THE POINT IS THAT SOME PEOPLE BEHIND THE VEIL MIGHT BE MORE WILLING TO GAMBLE THAN OTHERS

BASICALLY IT'S A PRETTY GOOD STARTING OFF POINT AND AN EXCELLENT TOOL FOR CONSIDERING CERTAIN POLITICAL SUGGESTIONS BUT ULTIMATELY IT DOESN'T LEAD TO A LOT OF DEFINITIVE ANSWERS
THE PROBLEM WITH THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE IS RAWLS ASSERTS HOW EVERYONE WOULD NATURALLY REACT UNDER THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE

I DON'T THINK HE EVER DOES THE HEAVY LIFTING TO PROVE EVERYONE WOULD NATURALLY REDISTRIBUTE WEALTH TO MAKE THE MOST UNFORTUNATE MORE FORTUNATE UNDER THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISPROVE HIS ASSERTION BECAUSE NONE OF US CAN EXPERIENCE THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE IT IS JUST A RHETORICAL DEVICE USED AS A SMOKESCREEN SO PEOPLE DON'T NOTICE HOW BAD HIS ARGUMENT IS
ONE OF MY FAVORITE MENTAL EXPERIMENTS
OFTEN I USE NATURE NURTURE TO EXPLAIN THESE THINGS TO PEOPLE A SHOCKINGLY HIGH NUMBER OF MY FRIENDS COLLEAGUES IN A PROGRAMMING FIELD NO DOUBT STILL BELIEVE IF THEY WERE BORN IN BAD CONDITIONS THEY WOULD SIMPLY TELL THEMSELVES TO WORK HARDER THEY BELIEVE WHAT MAKES THEM THEM WOULD STILL EXIST THEY WOULD STILL GET A DEGREE AND A GOOD JOB THEY BELIEVE THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE THEM THAT REMAINS THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT BODY OR ENVIRONMENT THAT OUR CONSCIOUSNESS SPAWNED INTO IS THERE A NAME FOR THIS IDEA OR BELIEF
THE VEIL OF IGNORANCE DOES NOT MORALLY JUSTIFY COMPULSORY INCOME REDISTRIBUTION

NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE SOMEONE PROPERTY BY FORCE SHOCKING TO ME HOW ARROGANT PEOPLE GET WHEN THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN THE SHOES OF A POLITICAL OVERSEER I GUESS IT SHOULDN'T BE SHOCKING BECAUSE LONG AGO I HELD SIMILAR VIEWS BUT I SIMPLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW I COULD HAVE
THE BASIC POINT APPEARS TO BE THAT SCIENCE CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT WHAT EXISTS OR NOT BECAUSE IT ONLY EVER HAS TO DO WITH EMPIRICAL ADEQUACY HOW WELL A THEORY DESCRIBES THE BEHAVIOR OF CERTAIN PHENOMENA THAT A THEORY CAN BE USEFUL WITHOUT MAKING CLAIMS TO TRUTHS ON WHAT ACTUALLY EXISTS

WHILE IT'S TRUE IN A SENSE I THINK THIS ARTICLE UNFAIRLY SINGLES OUT SCIENCE AS SPECIFICALLY DEFICIENT IN THIS REGARD WHEN IT'S NO WORSE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN SUGGESTING TO US WHAT EXISTS OR NOT HE CLAIMS THAT ELECTRONS ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND WE CAN ONLY SEE IMAGES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF THEM EXCEPT THAT'S TRUE ABOUT EVERYTHING EVERYTHING WE SEE IS AN IMAGE OR A REPRESENTATION FILTERED THROUGH FALLIBLE PERCEPTIONS AND SENSES MUCH OF IT ISN'T EVEN FIRST HAND FOR INSTANCES I HAVE ONLY EVER SEEN IMAGES OF ALBERT EINSTEIN MIGHT I NOT CONCLUDE THAT IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED BUT THEN HOW WOULD I GO ABOUT DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT HE EXISTED SIMPLE I DO RESEARCH I LOOK UP HIS WRITTEN WORKS I SEARCH UP RECORDS OF HIS LIFE ETC IN OTHER WORDS I DO MUCH THE SAME THINGS THAT A SCIENTIST WOULD DO WHEN GOING ABOUT LOOKING FOR A PREDICTED PARTICLE OBSERVE ITS EFFECTS AND ITS BEHAVIORS WITH RESPECT TO THE WORLD AROUND IT I DON'T SEE THE METHODS OF SCIENCE AS BEING LESS USEFUL THAN ANY OTHER METHOD OF DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING EXISTS OR NOT
THEN WHAT WILL KEEP METAPHYSICS ON TRACK
DELETED
REMOVED
I DISAGREE WITH THIS THESIS I BELIEVE THAT TOO MUCH FOCUS ON EMPIRICISM CAN HOLD SCIENCE BACK IN TERMS OF PROGRESSION YOU NEED ADEAD AND SPECULATIONS AND AS IDEAS AND SPECULATIONS ARE NOT SOMETHING EVIDENT THEN IT AUTOMATICALLY FALLS UNDER THE FIELD OF METAPHYSICS I LIKE THE IDEA OF BALANCE AND I BELIEVE SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS FULFILL EACH OTHER JUST AS CYNICISM AND ROMANTICISM ARISTOTLE SPECULATED THAT THE EARTH WAS ROUND HE WASN'T THE FIRST ONE BUT IT SEEMS THAT HE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO PROVIDE SOME LOGICAL ARGUMENTS IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN METAPHYSICAL GOES FOR GRAVITY WITH ISAAC NEWTON
I'M SORRY I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING MORE CONVINCING THAN HILARY SUCCINCT POINT THE POSITIVE ARGUMENT FOR SCIENTIFIC REALISM IS THAT IT IS THE ONLY PHILOSOPHY WHERE THE SUCCESS OF SCIENCE IS NOT A MIRACLE

I DON'T BUY INTO FOR EXACTLY THE SAME REASON WHY I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN DESCARTES DEMON OR DREAM SCENARIOS JUST BECAUSE IT IS METAPHYSICALLY POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING IS THE CASE DOES NOT GIVE ME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS ACTUALLY CASE FOR ME TO BECOME AN THE NEED TO PRESENT A FLESHED OUT THEORY THAT HAS EVEN THE TINIEST FRACTION OF PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY I NEED A REPLACEMENT THEORY THAT IS A REASONABLE DEMAND FOR ANYONE TO MAKE METAPHYSICS EXISTS BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT A POSITIVE THEORY OF THE NATURE OF THE WORLD WHAT THEORY IS THERE THAT IS ACTUALLY BETTER
FROM SEP

WITH HIS DOCTRINE OF CONSTRUCTIVE EMPIRICISM VAN FRAASSEN IS WIDELY CREDITED WITH REHABILITATING SCIENTIFIC THERE HAS BEEN A CONTENTIOUS DEBATE WITHIN THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE COMMUNITY OVER WHETHER CONSTRUCTIVE EMPIRICISM IS TRUE OR FALSE THERE IS ALSO SOME UNCLARITY REGARDING WHAT VAN ARGUMENTS FOR THE DOCTRINE ACTUALLY ARE IN ADDITION THERE ARE CONTROVERSIES ABOUT WHAT THE DOCTRINE ACTUALLY AMOUNTS TO WHILE CONSTRUCTIVE EMPIRICISM HAS NOT GAINED A WIDE NUMBER OF ADHERENTS IT CONTINUES TO BE A HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL DOCTRINE IN PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE

A HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL DOCTRINE IN PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE BUT LITTLE INFLUENCE ON SCIENCE ITSELF IMO

IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE THE ENCHANTED FOREST HAS SUCCESSIVELY BEEN POPULATED WITH RAIN GODS MUSICAL SPHERES PHLOGISTON ETHER MULTIPLE UNIVERSES BIG BANGS COSMIC INFLATION DARK MATTER DARK ENERGY AND SINGULARITIES A SCIENTIST WHO BELIEVES IN THE EXISTENCE OF THESE UNOBSERVED ENTITIES HAS WANDERED INTO A THICKET OF METAPHYSICAL SPECULATION AND LEFT THE REALM OF SCIENCE SAYS VAN FRAASSEN

SO WHAT PHILOSOPHICAL METAPHYSICS IS CONSTANTLY ARGUING ABOUT UNOBSERVABLE LIKE ZOMBIES ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT CONSCIOUS ROBOTS BATMAN SUPERMAN THE MATRIX GOD



INDEED IF SCIENCE IS THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH THEN MANY THINGS SCIENTISTS TOUT AS KNOWLEDGE AND FACT ARE NOT SCIENCE MODELS AND THEORIES ARE NOT FACTS THEY DON'T EVEN REPRESENT REALITY THEY'RE JUST CONVENIENT WAYS TO THINK ABOUT MATHEMATICAL ABSTRACTIONS THOUGHTS AND MATHEMATICAL ABSTRACTIONS ARE NOT EQUAL TO REALITY AND SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH REALITY

SO IF THE IDEA OF A FORCE FIELD OR PHYSICAL ELECTRON HELPS A SCIENTIST FEEL BETTER ABOUT WHAT IS SUPPOSEDLY GOING ON OK DON'T PRETEND LIKE THESE ARE FACTS THEY DON'T EVEN PREDICT ANYTHING TO DATE MODELS HAVEN'T PREDICTED ANYTHING MATH HAS PREDICTED EVERYTHING AND MODELS ARE SIMPLY INVENTED TO TRY AND APPLY SOME PHYSICAL MEANING TO THE MATHEMATICS GOD MAKES THE CHARGE MOVE AND MATH MAKES THE CHARGE MOVE AS WELL AS I DON'T KNOW HOW THE CHARGE MOVES ARE NOT GOOD ANSWERS FOR A SCIENTIST BUT A LOGICAL EQUIVALENT THAT SOUNDS A LOT BETTER THE WAVES IN A FORCE FIELD MAKES IT MOVE IS A REALLY GOOD ANSWER
I AGREE IF SCIENCE WERE TO TREAT METAPHYSICS SERIOUSLY THEN RELIGIOUS TEACHING WILL BECOME WIDESPREAD THROUGHOUT ALL SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND MISINFORM EVERYONE TURNING THEM INTO USELESS TOOLS COMPLETELY MONITORED AND PREDICTABLE AS PART OF A DESIGN MADE BY OUR GOVERNMENT

ON WAIT IT'S ALREADY LIKE THAT

THAT MEANS IT'D BE WORSE LIKE TRUMP WORSE
AN ETHIC IS A RULE GOVERNING CONDUCT LIBERTY IS THE ANTITHESIS OF HAVING RULES ON CONDUCT IT IS THE ABSENCE OF RESTRAINTS ON CONDUCT THEREFORE IT CANNOT BE THOUGHT OF AS AN ETHIC

LIBERTY UNDERSTOOD AS INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS RESTRICTS CONDUCT THAT WOULD VIOLATE THOSE RIGHTS IN THIS WAY LIBERTY IS AN ETHIC BY THE AUTHOR'S OWN DEFINITION

THE AUTHOR MIGHT HAVE A POINT IF LIBERTY IS THE SAME THING AS COMPLETE WANTONNESS IN ONE'S ACTIONS BUT EVEN HE SEEMS TO SAY THAT ISN'T THE CASE

STATISTS GONNA STATE I GUESS

LIBERTY AS AN ETHIC WOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE PART OF A LARGER SET OF ETHICS NO SINGLE ETHIC EXISTS IN A VACUUM
LIBERTY IN MY OPINION IS THE EXTERMINATION OF RULES THAT ARE NOT OBJECTIVELY ETHICAL ALL RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE NOT SOLELY THEIR FOR THE PROTECTION OF NATURAL RIGHTS
AS A SORT OF RESPONSE TO ALL OF THE COMMENTS I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR DID A POOR JOB DEFINING LIBERTY AND I THINK THAT IT COULD HELP TO CLEAR IT UP

BY LIBERTY THE AUTHOR IS REFERRING TO ANARCHY WHICH MAY HAVE SOME OF YOU SCRATCHING AT YOUR HEAD BUT LIBERTY AS AN ENDS IS ANARCHY ABSOLUTE FREEDOM MEANS BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE FREEDOMS WHICH MEANS FREEDOM TO AND FREEDOM FROM IF THERE WERE NO LIMITATIONS ON WHAT YOU ARE FREE TO DO AND NO CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE ACTIONS BESIDES BASIC OPPORTUNITY COST THEN WHAT YOU HAVE IS HOBBES STATE OF NATURE ABSOLUTE FREEDOM IS ANARCHY THE DISPUTE COMES FROM WHAT THE STATE OF NATURE WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE ACCORDING TO HOBBES IT MEANS THE FREEDOM TO ACT UPON AND BE ACTED UPON THINK ABOUT AND BE THOUGHT ABOUT SPEAK AND BE SPOKEN TO MUCH LIKE THE ANIMAL WORLD PURE COMPETITION NO REGULATIONS BUT THIS MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE THE CASE

IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH STATISTS BUT RATHER THE CLASSICAL QUESTION OF THE HUMAN NATURE IN CHINA BEFORE THEY ADOPTED A MORE WESTERNIZED ECONOMY AND POLITICAL SYSTEM THE FIRST LINE IN THE FIRST BOOK THAT CHILDREN WOULD READ ASSERTED THAT THE NATURE OF MAN WAS INHERENTLY GOOD SOURCE KU HUNGERING SPIRIT OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE THIS ACTUALLY CAUSED A STATE BASED ON CONFUCIANISM WHERE THERE WAS A RELIGION OF GOOD CITIZENSHIP SO TO SPEAK RATHER THAN HAVING A RIGID DISTINCTION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE WITH BOTH HAVING A FOUNDATION OF PHILOSOPHY THE CONFUCIAN STATE BLENDED RELIGION PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS TOGETHER INTO A SYSTEM THAT COULD NOT DIVORCE ANY OF THOSE THREE ASPECTS AND IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS CHINESE SOCIETY HAS LASTED SO LONG AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN RELEVANT ESPECIALLY ECONOMICALLY

THIS IS BASICALLY A LONG-WINDED POST TO SAY THAT THE ARTICLE HAS A STRONG ARGUMENT BUT BOTH THE ARGUMENT ITSELF AND THE REFUTATIONS THEREOF ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT HUMANS DO WHEN NO ONE IS LOOKING SEVERAL PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES SHOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE BEING WATCHED THEY ACT MORE MORALLY ACCORDING TO THE SOCIETAL CONTEXT THAN WHEN THEY ARE NOT

THE TOP COMMENT HAS TO DEFINE LIBERTY DIFFERENTLY THAN THE AUTHOR TO MAKE HIS POINT WORK WE HAVE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS

EDIT I HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO FORMAT CORRECTLY
I DISAGREE WITH THE CORNERSTONE OF THE ARGUMENTATION LIBERTY IS A SET OF VALUES WHICH CONSTITUTES INDEED AN ETHIC LIBERTY MEANS TO RESPECT CERTAIN RIGHTS OF OTHERS EAST G THEIR LIVE OR THEIR PROPERTY AS WELL THEIR DIGNITY
I HAVE TO COMPLETELY DISAGREE IN FACT I WROTE AN ESSAY ON EXACTLY THIS THING

TL R
LIBERTY IS A POWERFUL TOOL IN THE HANDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND SUSTAIN LIVES PROPERTY AND THE HAPPINESS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IT SOCIETIES CAN AND SHOULD BE BUILT AROUND THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND THE CRITIQUE THAT SUCH A SOCIETY WOULD ALLOW FOR MISCREANTS AND CRIMINALS TO REIGN FREE SIMPLY DOESN T HOLD UP LAW CAN BE MAINTAINED IN AMERICA WHERE EVEN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CAN PASS LAWS THAT LIMIT THE FREEDOM OF ITS CITIZENS THIS IDEA IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER IN THE WORDS OF ANOTHER FAMOUS FRENCH PHILOSOPHER ALBERT CAMUS THE FREEDOM OF EACH FINDS ITS LIMITS IN THAT OF OTHERS NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO ABSOLUTE FREEDOM THE LIMIT WHERE FREEDOM BEGINS AND ENDS WHERE ITS RIGHTS AND DUTIES COME TOGETHER IS CALLED LAW AND THE STATE ITSELF MUST BOW TO THE LAW

STILL TL R LIBERTY IS AN ETHIC WHEN PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD
ABSTRACT

THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR I REMINDS US OF THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHICS IN WAR UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS MAY STATES WAGE WAR ON EACH OTHER AND WHAT ARE THE MORAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE CONDUCT OF WAR CECILE FABRE AND JEFF MCMAHAN ARGUED THAT TRADITIONAL ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS FAIL TO CONVINCE TRADITIONAL JUST WAR THEORY STANDS IN NEED OF REVISION AND THE ROLE OF ETHICS IN WAR NEEDS TO BE RECONSIDERED

HERE IN TURKEY WE HAVE MANDATORY PHILOSOPHY AT GRADES AND HOWEVER IT'S AWFUL WE DO MORE MEMORIZING THAN ACTUAL THINKING
WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE WE REMOVE FROM THE CURRENT CURRICULUM TO SUPPLANT IT WITH PHILOSOPHY OR ARE YOU PROPOSING WE ADD IT ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE PLEASE DO NOT READ MY COMMENT AS HAVING A NASTY TONE I'M WRITING THIS IN AN INQUISITIVE AND POLITE TONE
I PLACE AS MUCH FAITH IN THE CANADIAN EDUCATION SYSTEM TO TEACH ME PHILOSOPHY AS I DID IN THEIR ABILITY TO TEACH ME FRENCH

THAT IS TO SAY NOT VERY WELL VHS TAPES OF TALKING PINEAPPLES CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH
WHY ARE PEOPLE WITH PHILOSOPHY DEGREES SO CONVINCED THAT NO OTHER FIELDS USE OR TEACH LOGIC
WHILE DEFINITELY A MUCH NEEDED AND BENEFICIAL SUBJECT I THINK THAT IF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM DOES BEGIN TO ENFORCE IT THE SUBJECT WILL BE TAUGHT VERY POORLY AND NOT IN THE INTENDED MANNER IT'S A SUBJECT THAT REQUIRES CAUTION TO TEACH BUT IF TAUGHT WELL CAN BE GREATLY REWARDING
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE US ARE STILL BATTLING OVER TEACHING SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS EVOLUTION AND YOU THINK THEY CAN HANDLE SOMETHING AS ABSTRACT AS PHILOSOPHY GET REAL BRO
I'M A TEACHER GRADE AND WHILE PHILOSOPHY ISN'T A CORE SUBJECT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T THINK PHILOSOPHICALLY IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW YOU PHRASE THINGS AND ENCOURAGE KIDS TO THINK SELF DISCOVERY AND SOME BIG OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS CAN PROMPT THEM TO QUESTION THEIR WORLD AND WONDER

LAST YEAR SOMETHING CAME UP WHERE WE DISCUSSED WHAT IT MEANS TO EXIST LET ME TELL YOU A LARGE MAJORITY LOVED IT AND IT BROUGHT UP SOME GREAT QUESTIONS

THE TRICK IS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO BE CURIOUS YOU CAN DO THIS IN ANY SUBJECT IT'S HARD BUT AND SOMETIMES FAILS MISERABLY BUT WHEN IT WORKS IT'S GENUINE INTRIGUE AND I WOULD CONSIDER IT A SORT OF PHILOSOPHICAL LEARNING
EXCEPT YOUR EXAMPLE IS SEEN IN AWKWARD ADULTS ON REDDIN NOT IN REAL LIFE OR IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
IN MY COUNTRY IT'S MANDATORY IN GRADE TO AND GUESS WHAT NOTHING CHANGES YOU CAN'T TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO THINK MORE THAT YOU CAN TEACH DOLPHINS TO TALK
PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS MATH SCIENCE ENGLISH ETC IN SCHOOL THE REASON I BELIEVE THIS IS BECAUSE PHILOSOPHY FORCES YOU TO KNOW WHY YOU THINK SOMETHING IT FORCES YOU TO THINK THROUGH OPINIONS ISSUES LOGICALLY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT DONE ENOUGH

THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD REASON TO VALUE PHILOSOPHY THE ISSUE IS THAT IT'S NOT THE ONLY DISCIPLINE THAT REQUIRES ONE TO UNDERSTAND WHY ONE THINKS SOMETHING NOR IS IT THE ONLY DISCIPLINE THAT FORCES ONE TO THINK THROUGH THINGS LOGICALLY ALL THE DISCIPLINES YOU MENTION HAVE THOSE ASPECTS OF COURSE THOSE ASPECTS AREN'T ALWAYS TAUGHT EXAMPLE TEACHING MATHEMATICS OR SCIENCE AS A LIST OF FACTS RULES TO MEMORIZE RATHER THAN TEACHING WHY THOSE FACTS ARE TRUE WHY THOSE RULES ARE VALID BUT WITH THAT IN MIND IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT IF PHILOSOPHY WERE TAUGHT AT THE K LEVEL THAT IT WOULD FALL PREY TO THE SAME DANGERS AND BECOME YET ANOTHER WATERED-DOWN LIST OF SIMPLISTIC STATEMENTS THAT ARE EASY TO PUT ON A STANDARDIZED TESTAMENT

IF PEOPLE WERE EDUCATED ON THE LOGICAL FORMULA OF THINKING YES THERE IS ONE IMAGINE HOW MUCH MORE COOPERATIVE WE WOULD BE

COULD YOU ENLIGHTEN ME ON THIS WHAT EXACTLY IS THE LOGICAL FORMULA OF THINKING HOW WOULD PEOPLE KNOWING IT MAKE THEM MORE COOPERATIVE
PUBLIC SCHOOLING WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES
ADD THAT TO AN ALREADY FILLED DAY AND YOU ARE STAYING LATER WE COULD REMOVE HEALTH THOUGH THATD MAKE IT FIT
REMOVED
OP I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE NONCHALANTLY BUTCHER THE TERM LOGIC SO SEVERELY BEFORE FROM YOUR HAPHAZARD USAGE OF THE TERMS SOUND LOGIC ILLOGICAL VALID AND SO ON I DARESAY YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALLY TAKEN A COURSE ON FORMAL LOGIC YOUR ENTIRE POST WAS EXTREMELY CONVOLUTED AND YOUR VAGUE UNDERSTANDING OF LOGIC BEYOND STUFF THAT MAKES SENSE AND FALLACIES MAKES AN ABSOLUTE MOCKERY OF WHAT LOGIC ACTUALLY IS

UNFORTUNATELY YOU HAVEN'T DEFINED LOGIC VERY WELL IN YOUR POST AS A RESULT YOUR POST HAS LITTLE TO NO ACTIONABLE CONTENTION IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN YOU ARE USING THE TERM LOGIC YOU ARE REFERRING TO INFORMAL LOGIC WHICH IS THE STUDY OF EVERYDAY ARGUMENTS WITHOUT USING FORMAL RULES OR ANY SORT OF ORGANIZED SYSTEM TYPICALLY THESE EVERYDAY ARGUMENTS WILL BE EVALUATED IN A CRITICAL THINKING OR BABY LOGIC COURSE UNFORTUNATELY SAID EVERYDAY ARGUMENTS ARE OFTEN UNREALISTIC AND TOO LINEAR WHICH WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SKEW THE UNINFORMED STUDENT'S JUDGEMENT OF WHAT AN EVERYDAY ARGUMENT IS AND WOULD CONSEQUENTLY HINDER THEIR ABILITY TO EVALUATE ARGUMENTS IN REAL LIFE WHICH ARE A FAR CRY FROM THE SOCRATES IS MORTAL NONSENSE I SEE IN MOST INTRODUCTORY LOGIC COURSES

ON THE OTHER HAND FORMAL LOGIC WHICH IS WHAT MOST LOGICIANS ARE REFERRING TO WHEN THEY SAY LOGIC IN A NUTSHELL IS THE STUDY OF REASONING AND VALID AND INVALID INFERENCES TYPICALLY THIS WILL INVOLVE STUDYING AN OBJECT LANGUAGE SUCH AS PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC IN OTHER WORDS FORMAL LOGIC IS THE STUDY OF WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T CONCLUDE WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY FROM A SET OF PREMISES OR KNOWN INFORMATION AND THE STEPS YOU MUST TAKE TO GET TO THAT CONCLUSION OR IN THE CASE OF INVALIDITY WHY AND WHEN YOU CANNOT INFER A CERTAIN CONCLUSION FROM A SET OF PREMISES

ANYONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO A COURSE IN FORMAL LOGIC AND METALOGIC THE LOGIC OF LOGIC OR THE THEORY BEHIND DIFFERENT OBJECT LANGUAGES BOTH OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY MATHEMATICAL SUBJECTS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NUANCES OF EVERYDAY ARGUMENTS AS WELL AS THE SCOPE OF DEDUCTIVE LOGIC I FEEL LIKE THIS POST FROM R LOGIC ELABORATES ON MY POINT QUITE CLEARLY



THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF ON YOUR TOPIC OF INTEREST BEFORE YOU START THROWING AROUND TECHNICAL TERMS LIKE VALID SOUND AND LOGIC YOUR THESES WILL NOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY IF YOU DO NOT ADEQUATELY DEFINE THESE CRUCIAL TERMS ALSO YOU RISK MISLEADING ANY PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS OF PHILOSOPHY BY LACKING UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS LOGIC LOGIC IS A SUBSET OF EPISTEMOLOGY AND EPISTEMOLOGY IS A SUBSET OF PHILOSOPHY YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHEN YOU REFER TO THESE TERMS INSTEAD OF CONFLATING PHILOSOPHY WITH LOGIC

EDITED TO REMOVE SLURS


TEACHING KIDS CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS IS PROBABLY PRETTY LOW ON THE GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITY LIST IT WILL NOT PRODUCE A DOCILE POPULATION OF OBEDIENT WORKERS

HAVING SAID THAT I FULLY SUPPORT TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS IN SCHOOLS ACROSS THE GLOBE WHILE I'M ON MY SOAPBOX TEACHING KIDS SOME BASIC LIFE BASIC PERSONAL FINANCE SKILLS WOULD BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT ON THE STATUS QUO
NUMBER JUST NUMBER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MEAN WELL AS WELL AS SEE THE VALUE OF WHAT YOU PROPOSE ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO LOGICAL THOUGHT AND EXPERIMENTATION BEING A FUNDAMENTAL THAT WOULD PROVE USEFUL TO A CHILD IN AN ACADEMIC SETTING BUT YOU HAVE MISSED A FEW IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WOULD CREATE A GREATER PROBLEM

K ARE GENERALIZED STANDARD EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS WITH A FOCUS ON CORE FUNDAMENTALS AND CURRICULUM OFTEN DRIVEN BY STANDARDIZED TESTING REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING SYSTEMS ATTEMPTING TO INTRODUCE A NUANCED SUBJECT SUCH AS PHILOSOPHY WOULD CREATE A WHOLE LIST OF PROBLEMS CONSIDERING THOSE OF US WITHIN THE FIELD ARGUE OVER MUNDANE PERSPECTIVES AND OUTLOOKS INTRODUCING IT INTO GENERAL EDUCATION WOULD FORCE THE COMMUNITY TO RECOGNIZE A STANDARDIZE A SYSTEM OF THINKING IN ORDER TO FIT IT TO A MANDATED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM SOMETHING A PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR WOULD LIKELY AGREE IS ALREADY PROBLEMATIC IN THE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION WHERE THERE IS MORE FLEXIBILITY

2 A PERSON REALLY NEEDS TO DEVELOP OPINIONS PERSONALITY AMBITION AND PERCEPTION BEFORE EVER REALLY DELVING INTO PHILOSOPHY AS THE CORE OF IT IS TO CHALLENGE AND EXPERIMENT WITH PERSPECTIVE IDEAS AND OPINIONS ATTEMPTING TO TEACH THAT TO YOUNG STUDENTS BEFORE THEY HAVE REALLY DEVELOPED ANY OF THOSE THINGS IS LITTLE MORE THAN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ABUSE AND AS ANY ONE OF US WHO HAS ATTENDED A PHILOSOPHY COURSE WILL ATTEST TOO IT'S A STRUGGLE TO CUT AWAY OUR OWN PERSONAL BIAS WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT PHILOSOPHY WITH SOMEONE WHO MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN ANYTHING RELATED I'M CERTAINLY GUILTY OF ABUSING WHAT I LEARNED WHEN SPEAKING TO FULLY GROWN ADULTS NO DOUBT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ABUSES AGAINST YOUNGER MINDS WOULD BE AN ISSUE NO LESS OF AN ISSUE THAN THOSE OF RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ATTEMPTING TO SHAPE YOUNG MINDS BEFORE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO FULLY DEVELOP THE LAST THING WE NEED IS 3RD GRADERS FIGHTING IN THE SCHOOL YARD OVER EXISTENTIALISM VS BECAUSE THEY WILLIAM THEY'RE 3RD GRADERS
IN THE FULL IB PROGRAM THEY TEACH THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE FOR GRADE AND
WHY DO YOU NEED PHILOSOPHY IF WE CAN JUST HAVE CLASSES IN RATIONAL DISCOURSE AND LOGIC
WE SHOULD TACKLE SEX EDUCATION PERSONAL FINANCE SPELLING ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION HAND HYGIENE AND BASIC COOKING AND OTHER LIFE SKILLS FIRST YOU'RE A DECADE TOO SOON FOR THIS KIND OF POST IF EVER

SIDE NOTE WE NEED TO INVEST IN PAID APPRENTICESHIPS FOR DEVELOPING A SKILLED AND COMPETENT PUBLIC IN AMERICA SERIOUSLY

NOT INDIRECTING ANYONE JUST SAYING IF YOU'RE WHINING ON THE INTERNET ABOUT SOMETHING YOU THINK ANYONE OWES YOU FOR EXISTING YOU'RE SPOILED AND I'M SICK OF YOUR BITCHING

ALSO PLEASE DON'T HIT ON YOUR NURSE AND ASK FOR THEIR PHONE NUMBER THANKS CAN YOU TELL I HAD A ROUGH NIGHT AND I'M KNOWN AS THE SWEET NURSE IN OUR ICA
STEP TEACH PEOPLE TO THINK RATIONALLY EMPIRICALLY
GET BACK TO ME WHEN YOU GET STEP ONE THOROUGHLY WORKED OUT

EDIT ACTUAL GET BASIC NUMERACY AND LITERACY WORKED OUT AND THEN MOVE ON TO STEP ONE AND THEN WORRY ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT
BUT THEN PEOPLE MIGHT ACTUALLY BEGIN TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES
IMAGINE HOW SHITTY THE TEACHERS WOULD BE THOUGH
HERE IN THE US SOME IB SCHOOLS OFFER THE COURSE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE OK AND IT IS QUITE AMAZING YOU SIT IN AN OPEN FORUM CIRCLE AND JUST DISCUSS LIFE AND WHAT NOT
NO THINKING CRITICAL CREATIVE ANALYTICAL SYNTHETIC ETC SHOULD BE PHILOSOPHY AS SUCH SHOULD BE ENLISTED BUT NOT TAKEN AS THE CENTRAL THEME AS IT IS TOO FUCKED UP
WHILE I AGREE IN PRINCIPLE THE BIGGER PROBLEMS I SEE ARE NOT ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF ARGUMENTATION BUT THE BIASES FALLACIES OVERSIMPLIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ERRORS PEOPLE MAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE ECOLOGICAL FALLACY A STATISTICAL ERROR IS VERY COMMON IN BOTH FAR LEFT AND RIGHT WING TREATMENT OF IDENTITY GROUPS LIBERTARIANS COULD USE GAME THEORY LESSONS AND SO ON

AMONG THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE TAUGHT ARE BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS 2 STATISTICS AND COMMON ERRORS GAME THEORY WITH A FOCUS ON UNINTUITIVE SOLUTIONS PRISONERS DILEMMA ULTIMATUM GAME THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD PARTICULARLY AGGREGATING KNOWLEDGE BY REPEATABILITY NOT RESULTS AND CRITICAL THINKING DEBATE AND OTHER PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS

I THINK OP IS MAKING THE ARGUMENT THAT RHETORIC DEBATE NOT PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE A CORE SUBJECT THE ABILITY TO USE A COMBINATION OF LANGUAGE MATH AND LOGICAL SKILLS TO PRESENT AND THEN SUPPORT OR DESTROY AN ARGUMENT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE AS A CORE SUBJECT BUT THAT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY MEAN A PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL
THE BRAIN DOES NOT DEVELOP THE HIGHER ORDER THINKING SKILLS REQUIRED TO EXPLORE WHY HOW AND SO ON UNTIL AROUND 6TH GRADE ATTEMPTING TO TEACH THEM BEFORE THIS AGE WOULD NOT BE USEFUL FOR CORE EDUCATION CLASSES MEANT TO BUILD THE EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION OF A YOUNG PERSON

HOWEVER I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT SHOULD BE A CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL KIDS WITH OPINIONS ARE LIKE TRUMP SUPPORTERS WITH GUNS
IN FRANCE IT'S MANDATORY IN HIGH SCHOOL I JUST GOOGLED IT TO FIND SOME INFO ABOUT IT BUT ALL I FOUND WERE REALLY STUPID ARTICLES BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY AND STILL LOOK AT THIS AS YET ANOTHER FRENCH ODDITY

DESPITE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS I STILL REMEMBER PHILOSOPHY CLASSES IN MY FRENCH HIGH SCHOOL AS A GREAT INTRODUCTION TO THE SUBJECT I MAY NOT HAVE BECOME AN EXPERT FAR FROM IT BUT AT LEAST THEY FAMILIARISED ME WITH BASIC PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS I'M STILL FOND OF EXISTENCE PRECEDES ESSENCE

ANOTHER SUBJECT I BELIEVE EVERY STUDENT SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH IS BASIC LAW CONCEPTS LIKE THE UNIVERSALISM OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND WHAT IT MEANS OR THE PRINCIPLE OF OF CRIMINAL LAW
PUBLIC EDUCATION ISN'T MEANT FOR TEACHING PEOPLE HOW TO THINK IT'S BASIC TRAINING FOR ENTRY LEVEL JOB PLACEMENT A PUPPY MILL

THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A MAJOR CULTURAL SHIFT FOR THE K EDUCATIONAL END GAME BEFORE ANYONE SPENT TIME AND RESOURCES ON TEACHING LITTLE JOHNNY HOW TO THINK CRITICALLY INSTEAD OF ROTE BASHING THE R'S




DELETED
IF PUPILS HAVE A CRITICAL REASONING CLASS THEY'LL BE BEYOND BORED AND ANYONE THAT HAS BEEN TO A PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL WILL KNOW THAT NO ONE WILL LISTEN TO THE CLASSICAL

IF WE WANT TO DEVELOP CRITICAL REASONING IN THE NEWER GENERATIONS WE NEED BETTER TEACHERS AND A BETTER CURRICULUM TO DO THAT WE EITHER NEED TO INCREASE THEIR SALARIES OR TO INCREASE THE PERCEIVED PRESTIGE OF THE PROFESSION BOTH OF WHICH ARE TOUGH THINGS TO DO
I TOTALLY AGREE HOWEVER THIS WILL LIKELY NEVER HAPPEN BECAUSE IT IS AGAINST THE INTEREST OF THE STATE TO HAVE THINKING SUBJECTS THE STATE WOULD MUCH RATHER TEACH ITS STUDENTS WHAT TO THINK THAN HOW
PHILOSOPHY IS ALREADY CORE CURRICULUM IN EVERY TOP RANKED SECONDARY SCHOOL IN THE US IF YOU LOOK UP THE COURSE OF STUDY AT PHILLIPS ANDOVER FOR EXAMPLE PHILOSOPHY COURSE IS REQUIRED FOR GRADUATION
I DON'T THINK LEARNING THE FORMULA FOR MAKING ARGUMENTS IS GOING TO MAKE A DISCUSSION ANY BETTER NECESSARILY I THINK THERE A WIDE VARIETY OF WAYS PEOPLE DISCUSS POLITICS AND THE PARTISAN DIFFERENCES DONT HAVE TO DO WITH CONTENT AS MUCH AS WHAT NORMS THEY VALUE THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD THEIR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT IN OTHER WORDS A MORE ACCEPTABLE WAY OF YELLING AD HOMINEM WONT MAKE IT ANY BETTER
ALSO COMES DOWN TO WHAT PHILOSOPHY WE CHOOSE TO DISCUSS UPHOLDING WESTERN TRADITIONS OR GETTING CRITICAL AND HISTORCIZING ALL THE ABSTRACT TALK OF CONTRACTS AND FREEDOMS WITHIN THE MASCULINE WHITE SUPREMACISTS WHO SAID THEM
IF EVERYONE WAS TRAINED TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT A PERSONS LIFE EXPERIENCE WHICH FORMS THEIR PERSPECTIVE BE TAUGHT THE LOGIC THAT COULD BE USED WHEN DISCUSSING IDEAS AND BE TAUGHT THE TRUE NATURE AND MEANING OF THINKING WE WOULD ALL GET ALONG MUCH BETTER AND MORE WOULD GET DONE


SO WHY NOT JUST TEACH BASIC EMPATHY
I THINK PHILOSOPHY HELPED ME A LOT IN HIGHSCHOOL IT WOULD NOT HAVE HELPED ME EARLIER THOUGH
THERE SHOULD BE A CRITICAL THINKING CLASS K AND MAYBE PHILOSOPHY
ON THE ONE HAND I DO BELIEVE THAT TEACHING PHILOSOPHY TO KIDS IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON HOW TO THINK HOW TO REASON HOW TO ARGUE AND HOW TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL

I ALSO DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE OBJECTION THAT KIDS CAN'T HANDLE PHILOSOPHY THEY CAN AND THEY EVERY TIME A KID ASKS A QUESTION AND KIDS ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS THEY'RE WORKING TO SYNTHESIZE THEIR OWN PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS IF THEY CAN PERFORM PHILOSOPHY HAPHAZARDLY THEN THEY CAN LEARN HOW TO PERFORM IT WITH A BIT MORE INTENTION

I'VE ALSO PERSONALLY HAD VERY GOOD EXPERIENCES WITH PHILOSOPHY IN THE CLASSROOM I TOOK A PHILOSOPHY ELECTIVE DURING MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL AND IT WAS MIND-EXPANDING I THEN WENT ON TO GET A BA IN PHILOSOPHY IN COLLEGE IN NO SMALL PART TO THE AFFECTION TOWARDS THE SUBJECT ENGENDERED BY MY HIGH SCHOOL CLASSICAL

ALL THAT SAID I HAVE TWO MAJOR OBJECTIONS TO YOUR PROPOSAL

CLASSROOM TIME IS A GAME IN ORDER TO ADD SOMETHING MUST BE SUBTRACTED THERE ARE NO SUBJECTS WHICH CAN BE SAFELY CUT IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM FOR PHILOSOPHY AS SUCH MIXING PHILOSOPHY INTO THE MIX WOULD REQUIRE A TOTAL REORGANIZATION OF HOW SCHOOL WORKS THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA ANYWAY BUT THAT'S A MUCH MUCH BIGGER QUESTION THAT PEOPLE BETTER INFORMED THAN US ARGUE ABOUT FIERCELY

2 THE SUREST WAY TO KILL ENTHUSIASM FOR A SUBJECT IS TO MAKE IT MANDATORY IN MOST CASES THAT'S A NECESSARY EVIL WE DON'T NEED KIDS TO LOVE BIOLOGY OR MATH THOUGH IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY DID SO LONG AS THEY UNDERSTAND THE BASICS PHILOSOPHY ON THE OTHER HAND LITERALLY MEANS THE LOVE OF WISDOM HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK SOME 6TH GRADER IS GOING TO LOVE MEMORIZING WHEN KANT WROTE THE CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON OR EXACTLY WHAT CAVE METAPHOR MEANT HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK SOME GRADER IS GOING TO LOVE IT WHEN GETTING A D MIGHT THREATEN HIS PLACE ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM I WOULD RATHER STUDENTS BE IGNORANT OF PHILOSOPHY THAN ACTIVELY RESENTFUL OF IT

ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY I DON'T FORESEE THIS BEING POSSIBLE UNLESS WE CHANGE OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM UNTIL THEN THINGS LIKE CRASHCOURSE PHILOSOPHY ARE ABOUT AS GOOD AS WE CAN DO
THIS WOULD BE GREAT BUT I THINK A FUNDAMENTAL LOGIC COURSE WOULD BE EVEN BETTER OR HAVE BOTH AND HAVE LOGIC AS A
IN QUEBEC WE HAVE MANDATORY PHILOSOPHY CLASSES AND I LOVE THEM ALTHOUGH OUR GRADING SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD

GRADE TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
GRADE TO HIGH SCHOOL
GRADE AND SCHOOL CALLED CÉGEP

WE HAVE PHILOSOPHY CLASSES DURING OUR TWO YEARS IN CÉGEP AND A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING ME FIND IT VERY HELPFUL
YOU'RE NOT ANGRY THAT PEOPLE AREN'T LOGICAL YOU'RE ANGRY BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE EMOTIONS THAT ARE VERBALIZED IRRATIONALLY VERBAL COMMUNICATION ISN'T SOLELY INTENDED FOR LOGICAL DISCOURSE EVEN THE MOST LOGICAL PEOPLE SAY THE MOST ILLOGICAL THINGS
FULLY AGREE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE CHANGED THE WAY I ARGUE WITH PEOPLE DRAMATICALLY IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO COMMUNICATE WITH A PERSON WHO HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION WHEN YOU CAN LOGICALLY EXPLAIN HOW THESE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ARE ALL ABOUT PERSPECTIVE THE ENTIRE IDEA OF SOMEONE HAVING A STUPID OPINION DISAPPEARS AND THE QUESTION BECOMES WHY DOES THIS PERSON HAVE SUCH AN OPINION SO MANY PEOPLE COULD IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNICATION SKILLS WITH JUST A SINGLE SIMPLE CONCEPT LIKE THAT

THE WHOLE CLASS WAS FULL OF CONCEPTS LIKE THAT AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE GENUINELY INTERESTED WE HAD EXTREMELY ARTICULATE PROFESSORS THOUGH IT WAS A BIG PART OF WHY THE CLASS WAS SO EDUCATIONAL WHICH MAKES ME WORRY THAT IN A SCHOOL ENVIROMENT IT MIGHT BE A LOT HARDER TO GET THE MAIN POINTS ACROSS WITHOUT HAVING ALL THE STUDENTS SLEEPING IN AND JUST WRITING THE WHOLE THING OFFICIAL
IN MY FINAL YEAR OF COLLEGE IN A SEMINAR ABOUT PLATO AND ONLY PLATO I HADN'T READ ONE OF THE DIALOGUES FOR THE COMING CLASSICAL WE WERE ALL REQUIRED TO BRING FIVE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS TO CLASSICAL BEING A SMARTASS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WAS GIVEN THAT PLATO WAS SO INFLUENTIAL AND THAT THIS DIALOGUE IN PARTICULAR IS PROF FAVORITE WHY HAVEN'T I READ THIS YET

THE PROFESSOR AND CLASS TURNED THIS INTO AN MINUTE DISCUSSION OF EDUCATION AND PHILOSOPHY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION I WAS EVEN COMMENDED FOR ASKING A REALLY TOUGH QUESTION

ANYWAY I THINK THE BASICS OF PHILOSOPHY THE FIVE SOCRATIC DIALOGUES SOME EXISTENTIALISM AND OTHER TOPICS SHOULD BE TAUGHT AS PART OF A CRITICAL THINKING COURSE THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL AGES T FOR THE NON-AMERICAN REDDITORS SOME ENGLISH LITERATURE AND HISTORY CLASSES WILL GET INTO CRITICAL ANALYSIS BUT IN MY EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE MOST OF THE CRITICAL THINKING WASN'T A FEATURE OF CLASS UNTIL THE FINAL YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL I WENT TO A FANTASTIC PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM FOR JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL AGES TO AND THEN A PRIVATE BOARDING SCHOOL FOR THE REST OF HIGH SCHOOL MATH CLASS TEACHES US HOW TO BREAK DOWN A WORD PROBLEM AND LANGUAGE CLASSES TALKS ABOUT THEMES BUT THERE WAS NO CLASS THAT WALK A STUDENT THROUGH ANALYZING A SPEECH OR A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE FOR BULLSHIT SO MUCH OF IT IS JUST FACTS WHICH ARE IMPORTANT BUT WITHOUT A CRITICAL MIND YOU'RE STILL A FOOL
FUCK THAT'S EXPENSIVE
2 KIDS ALREADY SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN SCHOOL THEY HAVE TO GET UP SO EARLY WHICH ISN'T GOOD AT THEIR AGE AND THEY ARE FREQUENTLY LOADED WITH HOMEWORK THROW ANOTHER LOG ON THE FIRE WHY NOT
PROBABLY WON'T EVEN HAVE AN IMPACT PEDAGOGY ALREADY HAS A HUGE FOCUS ON TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING AND LOGIC AND THEY HAVEN'T GOT MUCH TO SHOW FOR IT THE PSYCHOLOGIST ILYENKOV WROTE VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE TITLED OUR SCHOOLS MUST TEACH HOW TO THINK HETP WHICH MAKES MANY BRILLIANT POINTS AND I RECOMMEND YOU READ WHICH DEALS WITH THE PROBLEMS OF LOGIC AND PHILOSOPHY CLASSES BUT BRIEFLY HE STATES

INDEED IS IT POSSIBLE TO INCULCATE MIND INTO A PERSON IN THE FORM OF A SYSTEM OF PRECISELY AND RIGOROUSLY FORMULATED RULES OR OPERATIONAL
SCHEMAS IN SHORT IN THE FORM OF A LOGIC WE HAVE TO CONCLUDE THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE BEST RULES AND FORMULAS WHEN DRUMMED INTO A STUPID HEAD DO NOT MAKE THAT HEAD CLEVERER BUT ARE THEMSELVES TRANSFORMED INTO AMUSING ABSURDITIES THIS ALAS IS ONLY TOO WELL KNOWN HARDLY ANYONE WILL DISPUTE THE FACT THAT THE TEACHING OF FORMAL LOGIC INTRODUCED INTO OUR SCHOOLS SOME TIME AGO ON THE PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS OF COMRADE STALIN DID NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CLEVER PEOPLE OR REDUCE THE NUMBER OF STUPID PEOPLE AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL GRADUATES

I THINK MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD INSTRUCTION IN LOGIC PHILOSOPHY CRITICAL THINKING ETC IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION WILL AGREE THE CLASSES AS THEY ARE MOST PLACES WHERE THEY ARE TAUGHT AND I DO MEAN FROM CHINA TO TURKEY TO KENTUCKY DON'T MAKE PEOPLE SMARTER AND SMART PEOPLE WILL BE LARGELY FRUSTRATED BY THE CLASSES

WHAT IS SOLUTION WELL IT INVOLVES HUGE AMOUNTS OF LOVE AND ATTENTION AND LESS CRAMMING AND STRUCTURED CURRICULA WHICH NEWLAND WE DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR IN THE BUDGET


IN FINLAND YOU HAVE TO TAKE ETHICS FOR A WHILE
I THINK THE CASE MIGHT BE MADE THAT A CONSIDERABLE IF UNSURPRISING NUMBER OF THE RESPONSES HERE SIMPLY FURTHER YOUR POINT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO EITHER DIDN'T BOTHER TO FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH YOUR ACTUAL REASONING BEFORE THEY RESPONDED OR WHO CHOSE TO FOCUS ON ASPECTS OF THE POST OTHER THAN THE ACTUAL POINT OR THE REASONING BEHIND IT ARGUABLY SERVE AS ILLUSTRATIONS OF EXACTLY THE SORT OF FAILURES OF CRITICAL THINKING AND LOGIC YOU ADDRESS

BUT I'D SAY THE CASE COULD ALSO BE MADE THAT THAT'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT THE RESULTS OF PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH AN EARLY GROUNDING IN LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING MIGHT NOT ACCOMPLISH A WHOLE LOT ANYWAY SINCE IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT AT LEAST SOME CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RESPONDED MERELY TO HURL SOME RHETORIC INSTEAD OF TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE AN IDEA THAT THEY ACTUALLY CONSIDERED HAVE ALREADY HAD THAT GROUNDING FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IT'S NOT REALLY A MATTER OF EDUCATION AT ALL THEY HAVE IN FACT ALREADY BEEN TAUGHT HOW TO REASON EFFECTIVELY IT'S JUST THAT THEY AREN'T PSYCHOLOGICALLY EQUIPPED TO HONESTLY FACE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT POTENTIALLY UNDERMINE ANY OF THEIR CHERISHED PRECONCEPTIONS OR MORE SIMPLY IT'S NOT THAT THEY CAN'T THINK CRITICALLY BUT THAT THEY WON'T

OR TO ANALOGIZE IF SOMEONE IS SUFFICIENTLY EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN THE BELIEF THAT 2 2 NO AMOUNT OF EDUCATION IN MATH IS GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THEM NOT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GRASP THE CONCEPT BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT PSYCHOLOGICALLY EQUIPPED TO CONSIDER ANYTHING THAT RUNS CONTRARY TO THEIR PRECONCEPTIONS

THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH AN EARLY GROUNDING IN LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING SHOULDN'T BE MADE I'D WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE I JUST THINK THAT MUCH OF THE PROBLEM LIES ELSEWHERE
I THINK SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE BROAD SUCH AS A MORE HOLISTIC VIEW ON PHILOSOPHY POLITICS AND ECONOMICS WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE IDEAS YOU SUGGEST IT COULD INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS AROUND BASIC ECONOMIC IDEAS AUSTRIAN MARX CLASSICAL NEOCLASSICAL KEYNES ETC BEFORE LOOKING AT HOW THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE FAIL IN MANY SCENARIOS LOOK AT LOCHE MILLS AND HAVE A DISCUSSION ON ON MODERN DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM VERSES PERSONAL LIBERTY AND SO ON FLESH OUT THE IDEAS AND LIMITATIONS OF NAP VERSES THE ROLE STATES CAN PLAY IN PROVIDING COMMON GOODS THE IDEAS OF EXTERNALITIES ETC

HOPEFULLY THIS WOULD LEAD TO A MORE INFORMED AND CRITICAL ELECTORATE WHICH I THINK WOULD ONLY BENEFIT DEMOCRACY PROVIDED THE SCHOOL SYSTEM DOESN'T JUST BECOME A POLITICAL PROPAGANDA TOOL AS MANY IN THE US SEEM TO WANT
WHILE I AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT OF THIS POST AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF CRITICAL THINKING THAT PHILOSOPHY DOES GIVE IF THAT IS THE MAIN OBJECTIVE WHY NOT GIVE THEM DISCREET MATHEMATICS COURSES OR PROGRAMMING COURSES THIS WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE SAME GOAL BUT ALSO GIVE THEM PRACTICAL SKILLS AT THE SAME TIME SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT OF THE PHILOSOPHY I THINK THERE ARE BETTER MEANS OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS IN SCHOOL THAN PHILOSOPHY CAN OFFER
I'M TAKING PHILOSOPHY RIGHT NOW AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST ENGAGING CLASSES I'VE EVER TAKEN
PRIMARY SCHOOL EXISTS TO ENSURE THE LITERACY AND NUMERACY OF A NATION REMAINS HIGH A NATION WITH HIGH LITERACY AND NUMERACY NEARLY UNIVERSALLY HAS A HIGHER GDP THAN NATIONS WITH LOWER LITERACY AND NUMERACY IT'S NOT THERE TO TEACH YOU HOW TO BE AN ADULT IT'S NOT THERE TO TEACH YOU HOW TO LOGICALLY ANALYZE THINGS IT'S NOT THERE TO PROMOTE LOGICAL DEBATE ON ISSUES IT'S HERE TO HOPEFULLY ENSURE SOME LARGE PORTION OF THE UPCOMING CITIZENS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE GDP IN A MEANINGFUL WAY

I THINK PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURAL STUDIES SHOULD BE TAUGHT K TO CULTURAL STUDIES TAKE A DEEP LOOK AT POWER AND PRIVILEGE THROUGH ANALYSES OF THE POPULAR CULTURE SOCIAL MEDIA SOCIETY ETC IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH TO BE A SENSITIVE CRITICAL AND DEEP THINKER
I'D SAY YOU WANTED TO FOCUS ON LOGIC AND RHETORIC SO THAT WAY PEOPLE WOULD QUESTION AND ANALYZE EVERYTHING
READING THROUGH THE COMMENTS IT SEEMS LIKE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD FORMAL TRAINING IN PHILOSOPHY DON'T REALISE THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO MAIN BRANCHES OF LOGIC FORMAL AND INFORMAL

INFORMAL LOGIC IS WHAT WE USE TO MAKE SUBJECTIVE OR NORMATIVE ARGUMENTS AND LEARNING HOW TO BREAK THEM DOWN USUALLY BASED ON INDUCTIVE REASONING FORMAL LOGIC IS A DEDUCTIVE TYPE OF REASONING THAT IS BASICALLY MATHEMATICS WITH WORDS TO BOIL IT DOWN TO THE SIMPLEST TERMS POSSIBLE
THE COMMENTS HERE ARE HIGHLIGHTING HOW RIGHT YOU ARE OF THESE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT PHILOSOPHY IS AND THEY STILL FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO VOICE A STRONG OPINION


NICE IDEA BUT I DISAGREE

KIDS CANT THINK FOR THEMSELVES
THEY ARE LIKE LITTLE ROBOTS JUST SPEWING OUT WHATEVER THEY HEAR OR LEARN AT ANY GIVEN TIME CRITICAL THINKING IS NOT DEVELOPED UNTIL THEY ARE TEENAGERS WHAT KIDS REALLY NEED ARE HEALTHY ROLE MODELS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION ANOTHER COURSE MAKING THEM SIT AT A DESK WITH MORE BOOKS DOESNT HELP THAT
2 PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS ALREADY PERMEATE A LOT OF THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT PLANTING THE SEEDS AS YOU WOULD SAY LIKE SONG OR RHYMES THAT TEACH VALUES AND MORALS MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY LEARN FROM SOCIALIZING KIDS LEARN A LOT THEY DONT EVEN REALIZE CAUSE AND EFFECT THEORY OF MIND POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT COGNITIVE DISSONANCE ETC THEY DO BECOME AWARE OF THESE IDEAS EVEN IF THEY DONT KNOW WHAT THEYRE CALLED
LOL AT THE SAN HARRIS COMMENT
HOLY SHIT NUMBER WHILE I LOVE PHILOSOPHY AND WHILE IT WAS FUN IN COLLEGE I DON'T WANT MY KIDS WASTING TIME ON IT IN K EDUCATION THIS IS LIKE SAYING GAMING SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU ENJOY IT
IF A TEACHER IN ANY SUBJECT IS NOT ASKING YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE WHY BEHIND ANY SITUATION THEN THEY'RE DOING A DISSERVICE TO THEIR STUDENTS ALSO PHILOSOPHY IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE A PERSON IS TAUGHT TO BE LOGICAL THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS A GREAT TOOL FOR LOGICALLY DEDUCING THE ROOT CAUSE OR WHY OF ANY SCENARIO I'VE ENJOYED THE PHILOSOPHY CLASSES I'VE TAKEN HOWEVER I HOPE IT'S NOT THE ONLY PLACE SOMEONE LEARNS LOGIC OR IS ASKED TO DEDUCE WHY SOMETHING OCCURS
SO DO WE EXTEND THE SCHOOL DAY OR WHAT CLASS DO WE DROP YOU HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT IT IS A GOOD TOPIC TO TEACH BUT NOT THAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING ELSE
ATTEMPTING TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO DESIRE TO ENGAGE IN PHILOSOPHY WILL NOT WORK AND WILL NOT BE PROGRESSIVE PHILOSOPHY LIKE SOME SUBJECTS IS A FIELD THAT YOU HAVE TO WANT TO STUDY IN ORDER TO BE FULLY ENGAGED IN IT TO SOME PEOPLE IT ISN'T A FIELD THAT THEY WANT TO GET INTO AND WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT

I BELIEVE THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD HAVE A WIDER RANGE OF TEACHING INSTEAD OF RELYING ON ROTE MEMORIZATION AND A CERTAIN KIND OF ACADEMIC INTELLIGENCE SOME PEOPLE DO NOT PERFORM WELL THAT WAY WE NEED TO BE TEACHING CRITICAL THINKING PRACTICAL SKILLS AS WELL AS YOUR OBVIOUS MATHS SCIENCE HISTORY ETC ETC

THE FACT IS THAT WE TRY TO SHOVE CHILDREN INTO BOXES AND SOME DO WELL IN THOSE BOXES AND SOME DO NOT TRYING TO SHOVE CHILDREN INTO ANOTHER BOX OF PHILOSOPHY ESPECIALLY ALL CHILDREN WILL BE DAMAGING TO SOME CHILDREN

FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO LEARN IT FORCING THOSE UNINTERESTED IN IT TO LEARN IT WILL BE A DISASTER
YOU HAD ME UNTIL SAM HARRIS
REMOVED
I THINK THEY DID SOMETHING SIMILAR IN FINLAND WHERE THEY TEACH THEORY CLASSES INSTEAD OF THINGS LIKE MATH AND SCIENCE BUT ONLY FOR THE HIGHER CLASSES I THINK IT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF GRADES I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE RESULTS ARE AS IT IS STILL NEW I THINK IT WOULD WORK IF ALL THE CORE CLASSES NEEDED FOR UNIVERSITY ARE TAUGHT EARLIER BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE AN OVERHAUL OF THE CURRICULUM TO ACCOMMODATE FOR IT
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT PHILOSOPHY BUT I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT FORMAL LOGIC SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
TWO PROBLEMS GREAT CLASS IF YOU HAVE A GREAT TEACHER NOT SO MUCH WITH A TEACHER WHO IS DOING IT STRICTLY FOR A PAYCHECK 2 SOME KIDS WILL NOT BE READY TO LEARN ABOUT SUCH THINGS AT THAT AGE AND WILL RESENT THE ATTEMPT TO FORCE THEM I KNOW I WOULD HAVE
BTW

R PHILOSOPHY COMMENTS
I COULD SEE MAKING IT AN ELECTIVE AFTER 5TH OR 6TH GRADE BUT NOT BEFORE THAT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT MORE CLASSES SHOULD BE ELECTIVE AROUND MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL SURE KEEP THE CORE GRAMMAR MATH AND A FEW OTHERS BUT I THINK HAVING A MIXED OUTSIDE OF THAT CORE WOULD HELP KIDS FIGURE OUT WHERE THEIR PASSIONS ARE

I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THOUGH PHILOSOPHERS SEEM TO BE UNDER A BIT OF A CLOUD THESE DAYS AND THEIR REFLEXIVE BRUSHBACK OF SELF-IMPORTANCE MAY OVERSTEP ITSELF SOMETIMES YES PHILOSOPHY MATTERS BUT IT IS ALSO INTERTWINED WITHIN OTHER SUBJECTS AND TEACHING METHODS IT'S LIKE THE OLD GLASSES OF WATER PER DAY NONSENSE YOU'RE GETTING WATER IN YOUR MORNING CEREAL YOUR PIZZA YOUR BAKED POTATO AND MILKSHAKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO LITERALLY FILL A GLASS WITH WATER TIMES TO HYDRATE PROPERLY LIKEWISE WITH PHILOSOPHY FOR MOST PEOPLE THE AMBIENT LEVELS OF PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO BE A HEALTH BALANCED PERSON
MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER HERE I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THIS GOES ALONG WITH WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT OTHER SUBJECTS LIKE MATH WHICH I TEACH NOW WE TELL THEM A CERTAIN RULES AND WE GIVE THEM ACRONYMS TO REMEMBER THESE RULES BUT WE DON'T TELL THEM WHY THESE RULES MAKES SENSE IN THE END UP NOT GETTING IT THERE SHOULD BE A THEORY OF MATH CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHY DOES THE SAME THING BUT WITH OTHER SUBJECTS AND SOCIAL ISSUES I COULDN'T AGREE MORE
NOT NECESSARILY THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED COMMON CORE MATHEMATICS
I DON'T AGREE WITH K WOULD BE FINE
THE UNFORTUNATE THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT CHILDREN DON'T DEVELOP ABSTRACT THINKING UNTIL THEIR TEENAGE YEARS IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO TEACH IN HIGH SCHOOL THOUGH
I AGREE BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE CLASS SHOULD BE OPTIONAL I KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO JUST DON'T LIKE PHILOSOPHY AND THINKING IN A PHILOSOPHICAL WAY JUST BORES THEM AND MAKES THEM TIRED
I THINK SCHOOLS RUIN THE SUBJECTS THEY TEACH THEY ARE MORE EXERCISES IF ONE WANTED TO REALLY GET INTO A FIELD THEY WOULD HAVE TO LOOK MORE INTO IT THEMSELVES SCHOOL IS LIKE BASIC TRAINING FOR THE FIELD YOU'RE PURSUING EXPERIENCE IS THE REAL TEACHING
MOST PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT MATHS IN HIGH SCHOOL INCLUDING THOSE THAT DON'T EVEN STUDY CALCULUS TILL COLLEGE AND PEOPLE WHO AREN'T IN A MATHEMATICAL FIELD NEVER KEEP HIGH SCHOOL MATHS KNOWLEDGE IN THEIR HEADS ANYWAY I'M AFRAID A PHILOSOPHY PAPER WOULD BE TREATED IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY WILL ONLY MATTER TO THOSE WHO REMAIN IN RELATED FIELDS LIKE THE SUBSCRIBERS TO THIS SUB
THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND ALL BUT YOU KNOW ALL THOSE POLYNOMIALS ARE SO GODDAMNED IMPORTANT AND THANK CHRIST I WAS ABLE TO MEMORIZE EVERY PREPOSITION OTHERWISE I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'D BE TODAY
SCHOOLS ACTUALLY AVOID TEACHING PHILOSOPHY TO KIDS BELOW HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR GOOD REASON SINCE OUR CRITICAL AND INDEPENDENT THINKING IS SO SHODDY AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY WOULD WE BE PREPARED FOR PROPER LEARNING OF A LOT OF SUBJECTS LIKE COMPARATIVE LITERATURE RELIGION ETC PHILOSOPHY ACTUALLY HAS A TOXIC DOGMATIZING EFFECT WHEN TAUGHT WITHOUT A BACKGROUND OF FULL SCHOOLING AND SOME MATURITY
GREAT IDEA THE THULIUM METHOD SHOULD BE TAUGHT
I AGREE THAT PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO HIGH SCHOOLERS AS WELL AS OTHER PRACTICAL SUBJECTS PERSONAL FINANCE HANDLING STRESS ETC BUT THE REALITY IS IT WON'T BE FOR NEAR TERM SO I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT TEACHING THIS MYSELF TO MY DAUGHTER WHO JUST STARTED HIGH SCHOOL SOMETHING LIKE A HOME SCHOOL COURSE ON LIFE THINGS TAUGHT FOR AN HOUR EVERY OTHER SATURDAY OR SO I RAN THE IDEA BY HER AND SHE SEEMED POSITIVE ABOUT WHAT I MIGHT SAY SHE PUTS HERSELF UNDER STRESS AND I KNOW THAT TEACHING HER HOW TO MEDITATE EAST G WOULD HELP HER MANAGE IT BETTER I KNOW THAT THE BEST WAY TO TEACH IS BY EXAMPLE AND I TRY MY BEST EVERYDAY BUT SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO SAY SOMETHING AND GIVE THEM SOME GUIDANCE AND I DO BUT SHE KINDA SHUTS OFF WHEN I START WISE TALKING I REALLY COULD USE SOME HELP TO PUT THE CURRICULUM TOGETHER SOMETHING I COULD LEARN TO TEACH IN MEANINGFUL WAYS SO IF ANYONE HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS ON THE TOPICS HOW AND SUCH I'M ALL EARS
AT MY HIGH SCHOOL IN THE USA HISTORY DID A LOT OF PHILOSOPHICAL ASSIGNMENTS MANY WERE AROUND THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BUT THERE WERE SUBTLE ONES WHERE WE HAD TO THINK IF A PERSON WAS GOOD OR BAD AND WHY POPE URBAN THE 2ND WAS ONE OF THESE FIGURES NAPOLEON ANOTHER AT WE HAD LARGE CLASS DEBATES OVER IT HOWEVER THAT COULD OF JUST BEEN MY HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE
THERE ARE MANY DIFFICULTIES IN THIS AS THE GOVERNMENT IN MY CASE THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT REGULATES AND MANDATES A CURRICULUM IT'S DIFFICULT TO TAKE THE TIME TO FOSTER THIS TYPE OF CRITICAL THINKING AND ENCOURAGE QUESTIONING WHEN IMPOSED WITH TIME CONSTRAINTS

THE TWO PROBLEMS I FACE ARE

TIME I NEED TO COVER MATERIAL AND HAVE VERY LIMITED TIME TO TEACH EVERYTHING THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION EXPECTS

2 PARENTS SOME PARENTS HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS APPROACH AND WANT A VERY STRICT LEVEL OF EDUCATION WHERE I TELL AND THEIR CHILD MEMORIZES THE NEW LEARNING

METHODS OF EDUCATION CAN BE DEBATED BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM STUDENT AND NOW TEACHER IS THAT GENUINE INTEREST AND SELF DISCOVERY IS WHAT WILL BE REMEMBERED WHEN THE DUST SETTLES NOT THE DATE OR FACT I SPOON FED AND TOLD THEM TO COPY DOWN AND MEMORIZE FOR A MARK

THANK YOU I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS TO EVERYONE I MEET FOR YEARS
IT SHOULD BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN SCHOOLS ARE SO SCREWED UP THEY PUNISH SMART KIDS FOR THEY'RE NATURAL TALENT THEY DON'T TEACH IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE PHILOSOPHY OR HOW TO DO TAXES AND THEY LET 3RD GRADERS USE CALCULATORS IN CLASSICAL THE MORAL OF WHAT I SAID IS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN PROBABLY WON'T BECAUSE SCHOOLS ARE SCREWED UP
IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT WHAT YOU'RE REALLY AFTER IS TEACHING DISCOURSE AND LOGIC AND A LOT LESS ABOUT THE IDEOLOGIES OF GUYS LIKE PLATO PHILOSOPHY IS CERTAINLY A GOOD PLACE TO LEARN AND EXERCISE DISCOURSE AND LOGIC BUT I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT THERE IT'S AN EXTREMELY BROAD SUBJECT IT'S OPEN TO ABUSE INTENTIONAL OR OTHERWISE BY THE INSTRUCTOR SOME OF THE MATERIAL REALLY WOULDN'T BE GREAT FOR K AND MOST PEOPLE DO NOT FIND THE TOPICS ENGAGING

DISCOURSE AND LOGIC COULD BE TAUGHT IN MATH AND LITERATURE AND POSSIBLY A SPEECH DEBATE CLASSICAL WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL THAT'S WHERE THEY WERE TAUGHT YOU HAD TO WRITE A PAPER ABOUT A BOOK AND ARGUE FOR SOMETHING THEY JUST DIDN'T DO A GREAT JOB OF IT IN MY OPINION BUT IT WAS AT LEAST THERE I'D MUCH RATHER SEE THAT BEEFED UP SO THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON IS BETTER AT UNDERSTANDING MAKING AND DISMANTLING ARGUMENTS THAT SAID IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I WAS IN A K PROGRAM SO MAYBE IT ALREADY HAS BEEN
IF WE STICK TO THE IDEAS OF TEACHING PHILOSOPHY AS IN LOGIC REASONING AND CRITICAL THINKING THEN YES I'M ON BOARD I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF MANY TEACHERS DIDN'T ALREADY FEEL THAT THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO TEACH THOSE THINGS TEACHING THE HISTORY FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY AS YOU MIGHT IN AN UNDERGRAD COLLEGE COURSE THOUGH I'M NOT SO SURE
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT START TO EARLY THE FRONTAL CORTEX AND IN PARTICULAR THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX ARE USED IN CRITICAL THINKING AND THE YOUNGER A PERSON IS THE LESS DEVELOPED IT IS IF TIMES RIGHT AND IMPLEMENTED IN A MEANINGFUL WAY PHILOSOPHY CLASSES WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS AND THE COMMUNITY DONE WRONG AND IT'S JUST BORING THEORIES NO ONE REALLY THINKS ABOUT AND APPLIES TO LIFE
HOWEVER EVEN IF PEOPLE HAD SMALL FLICKERS OF PHILOSOPHY IN THEIR MIND THAT'S BETTER THAN NONE
PRIVATE SCHOOL MS HS TEACHER HERE I'VE TAUGHT A WEEK INTRODUCTORY PHILOSOPHY COURSE AT THE TH GRADE LEVEL TWICE THE PRACTICE THE STUDENTS GOT AS PERTAINING TO CRITICAL THINKING WAS INVALUABLE IN MY OPINION AND THERE ARE MANY POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES TO THE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT CAN BENEFIT STUDENTS AT A YOUNGER AGE

ON THE OTHER HAND BY FAR THE BIGGEST HINDRANCE WAS IS THAT GENERALLY DIRECT SOURCES REQUIRE PRETTY STRONG READING SKILLS IT SEEMED THAT YOUR AVERAGE OR GRADER HASN'T TYPICALLY ADVANCED THEIR READING SKILLS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE THE VOCABULARY OR STAMINA FOR A LARGE BODY OF IMPORTANT CLASSICAL TEXTS

IN PURSUIT OF THIS IDEA THOUGH WHICH I THINK IS ATTAINABLE I THINK WE NEED A MORE INTENTIONAL MOVEMENT CURRENT WRITERS TO EXPAND THE RESOURCES OF PHILOSOPHY WRITINGS THAT ARE AIMED AT AND WRITTEN FOR THAT AGE GROUP IT'S JUST VERY HARD TO FIND READABLE TEXTS THAT ARE ABLE TO HANDLE I HAVE NOTICED A HUGE INFLUX IN THE LAST FEW YEARS OF YOUTUBE CHANNELS DEDICATED TO EXPLAINING CONCEPTS AT A LEVEL FOR YOUNGER AGE GROUPS WHICH IS A GREAT START
NO BECAUSE SCHOOLS NEED HOME ED CLASSES MORE THAN PHILOSOPHY

I TOOK INTRO TO PHILOSOPHY AND ALL IT WAS WAS MEMORIZING IS GOD REAL DOES EVIL EXISTS WHAT DILEMMAS DID SOCRATES HAVE

MAYBE I JUST HAD A BUCKY PROFESSOR BUT THE COURSE WAS MORE ABOUT MEMORIZING THAN FORCING MYSELF TO CRITICALLY AND LOGICALLY THINK
OK SO JUST SAYING PHILOSOPHY SEEMS TO HAVE SOMEWHAT CONVOLUTED MY POINT I DONT WANT 6TH GRADER TO HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR LONG CLASS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY I WANT A CLASS THAT ENCOURAGES LARGELY PHILOSOPHICAL TYPE THINKING BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE TEACHING EVERYONE ABOUT CERTAIN PHILOSOPHY NICHES AND THE FULL UNDERSTANDING OF CERTAIN THINGS WITHIN PHILOSOPHY IF THAT MAKES SENSE PHILOSOPHICAL LOGICAL TYPE THINKING WITH UNDERSTANDING TOWARDS DIFFERENT MORTALITIES THAT'S WHAT I WANT THE CLASS TO BE BASICALLY WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE A DIFFERENT NAME THAN PHILOSOPHY IT WOULD JUST BORROW SOMETHINGS FROM PHILOSOPHY AS WE THINK OF THE COURSE NOW
BUT TEACH IT RIGHT THAN IN GERMANY AT GRADE OR YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY THE TEACHERS SUCKED AND EVEN GAVE BAD MARKS FOR OPINIONS WHICH DIFFERED FROM THEIRS I HAD TO RETAKE MY CLASS AND GOT A DIFFERENT TEACHER AND A YEAR AFTER SOMEONE AGAIN WITH THEM I HAD MOSTLY SUPERIOR MARKS AND IT WAS VERY FUN SOMETIMES BUT EVEN THOSE WERE KINDA MPH GOT A BAD MARK BECAUSE I WANTED TO SUPPORT FREE WILL EUTHANASIA FOR YOURSELF THE WHOLE CLASS AGREED WITH ME BUT SHE DID NOT BAD GRADE
IN THE PAST YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A INCREDIBLE SHIFT IN FOCUS AWAY FROM TEACHING MEMORIZATION TO CRITICAL THINKING TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON THIS AT LOWER LEVELS K HAS HAMSTRUNG UPPER LEVEL LEARNING BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE UNABLE TO QUICKLY RECALL INFORMATION THAT SHOULD ALREADY BE THERE

HIGH SCHOOL DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED A CLASS DESIGNATED FOR PHILOSOPHY HIGH SCHOOL NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS LESS ON REMEDIATION BESIDES THE MOST SUCCESSFUL HIGH SCHOOLS ALREADY EMPHASIZE PROBLEM SOLVING AND REASONING

IN AN AVERAGE CLASS STUDENTS WILL TOSS OUT GARBAGE OPINIONS AT AN INCREDIBLE RATE EX TRUMP SUCKS OBAMA SUCKS THE DRESS CODE SUCKS MACKLEMORE IS THE BEST RAPPER ALIVE ETC THE EDUCATOR'S JOB IS TO CHALLENGE THOSE OPINIONS RATHER THAN ARGUE BACK IT IS TEMPTING BUT DOESN'T TEACH THE DESIRED SKILL RATHER THE EDUCATOR SHOULD BE CHALLENGING THE STUDENT WITH THE VERY QUESTIONS YOU MENTION ABOVE NAMELY WHY IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE SAME SHOULD BE REQUIRED IN THEIR WRITING ASSIGNMENTS
I HAD A MANDATORY PHILOSOPHY COURSE FOR MY FIRST YEAR OF IB WE WROTE WORD ESSAYS ABOUT EVERY WEEK I DID AT LEAST AND DID PRESENTATIONS ABOUT CERTAIN OK CONCEPTS AND THEIR RELATION TO A REAL LIFE SITUATION WHILE THE CLASS WASN'T NECESSARILY AS RIGOROUS AS MY OTHER IB CLASSES IT WAS DEFINITELY MY MOST FAVORITE CLASS AND I WISH I COULD CONTINUE ON WITH OK
SO YEAH I DO KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TALK THE WAY YOU JUST DESCRIBED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF A PHILOSOPHY CLASS WILL HELP THAT I'M TAKING A PHILOSOPHY CLASS NOW AND ITS BASICALLY AN ENGLISH CLASSICAL AT LEAST LIKE THE ENGLISH AND HISTORY CLASSES I HAD IN HIGH SCHOOL WHICH FOCUSED ON DISCUSSION AND COMING UP BOTH IDEAS TO READ DEEPER TEXTS I DON'T THINK A CLASS IS GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY SOMEONE THINKS
PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS WOULD BE DIFFICULT AT BEST FOR CHILDREN TO GRASP BUT INCLUDING LOGIC IN ANY SUBJECT WOULD ALWAYS BE PREFERABLE TO ROTE MEMORIZATION AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL HAVING BASIC PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGIOUS HISTORY FROM A PURELY OBJECTIVE VIEW WOULD INDEED BE HELPFUL IN BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN DIFFERENT CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS GRANTED YOU'D HAVE TO SHAKE UP THE ENTIRE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
REMOVED
I'VE BEEN STUDYING PHILOSOPHY FOR 2 YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL IN ITALY THIS ONE WILL BE THE LAST ONE IT'S A USELESS SUBJECT HERE THE ONLY THING YOU LEARN IS HE SAID THIS AND THIS NOTHING ELSE TEACHERS DON'T TEACH YOU HOW SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT BUT WHAT AND IT IS JUST COMPLETELY USELESS IN THIS WAY

YOU WOULD SAY IT DEPENDS ON THE TEACHER BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE FROM MY SCHOOL TEACHES IN THE SAME WAY WHY AM I SUPPOSED TO MEMORIZE WHAT SOMEONE SAID IT'S NOT LEARNING TO LISTEN TO THE OTHERS BUT CONSIDER SOME IDEAS BETTER AND SUPERIOR THAN OTHER
HERE IN SPAIN WE ALWAYS HAD PHILOSOPHY AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECTS WELL NOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS PUT IT AS OPTIONAL ALSO THEY MADE MORE IMPORTANT RELIGION CATHOLIC OF COURSE SHAME ON THEM
CREDIT AND HOW TO AND NOT TO USE IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY IN ALL HIGH SCHOOLS
SOUNDS LIKE A CLASS THAT MORE PROMOTES CRITICAL THINKING IS WHAT IS NEEDED AGREED THOUGH AFTER PRINTING MODELING AND SOCIALIZATION CRITICAL THINKING IS RELATIVE YOU COULD OFFER A LITTLE GIRL TO MOW YOUR YARD TO GO GIVE TO A HOMELESS MAN THAT SHE WANTS TO HELP ONE PARTY MIGHT ADD THAT IT'S A SPLENDID IDEA OTHER MIGHT JUST WONDER WHY YOU DON'T OFFER THE HOMELESS MAN THE JOB IN ANYTHING RELATING TO PSYCHOLOGY PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO BE OBJECTIVE EVEN WHILE CRITICALLY THINKING THE IDEA OF A CLASS THAT TEACHES BASIC CRITICAL THINKING AND REASONING SKILLS IS A GOOD IDEA THOUGH WITH CURRICULUMS LIKE COMMON CORE COMING INTO PLAY I DON'T SEE THE CHILDREN GETTING ANY SMARTER
IF COMMUNITY COLLEGE WAS FREE FOR ALL AMERICANS AND PHIL WAS MANDATORY FOR GRADUATION THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT HAVING TO DELIVER A WATERED DOWN EXPERIENCE FOR ELEMENTARY AGES HIGH SCHOOL HAS THE ISSUE OF NOT HAVING ANY PHILOSOPHY TEACHERS WHERE AS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVELS THEY ALREADY DO
AS AN EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHER I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT OUR JOB AS A TEACHER IS TO TEACH THE WHOLE CHILD WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF A TEACHER IS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN TO EXPLORE AND MAKE MEANINGS TO WHAT THEY OBSERVE THEREFORE THE MAIN PURPOSE IS TO EQUIP THE STUDENT WITH EVERYTHING THEY NEED IN ORDER TO REACH THEIR GOAL BY UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF ASPECTS THEY ARE CURIOUS ABOUT NOW THERE ARE SOME TEACHERS WITH LACK OF MOTIVATION OR EDUCATION THAT DOESN'T REACH OUT TO THE WHOLE CHILD THESE ARE THE TEACHERS THAT GIVE MEANINGLESS FACTS TO STUDENTS LEAVING THE CHILD CONFUSED FOR FUTURE PROBLEMS AND HIGHER EDUCATION
WHILE NOT PHILOSOPHY THE LOGICAL REASONING INTRINSIC TO THE STUDY OF TALMUD WAS A VALUABLE SKILL I PICKED UP WHEN STUDYING THE TALMUD FROM 5TH GRADE
THIS IS JUST DUMB VISIT ANY CLASSROOM IN ANY SCHOOL AND SEE HOW MUCH IS ACTUALLY DONE

I THINK OP GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH SOMEONE LOST AND CAME TO VENT ABOUT HOW OTHERS MUST NOT HAVE LEARNED PHILOSOPHY OR OTHERS WOULD SEE HIS VIEW EVERY TIME
DR CHRISTOPHER DICARLO IS CURRENTLY DOING SOMETHING ALONG THESE LINES IN CANADIAN HIGH SCHOOLS ESSENTIALLY IT BOILS DOWN TO A WEEK OF INSTRUCTION IN CRITICAL THINKING EVERY YEAR OF SCHOOL THIS INVOLVES DISCUSSIONS OF EPISTEMOLOGY ARGUMENT BIAS AND FALLACIES HOPEFULLY IT WILL TAKE OFF AND EVERY KID IN HIGH SCHOOLS WILL BE BETTER OFF BECAUSE OF IT
MY FAVORITE DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPHY IS THE ART OF CRITICAL THINKING ALSO THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AS A REAL EXPOSE ON ANY MEASURE OF ACTUAL PHILOSOPHY WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY UNRAVEL THE INCONSISTENCIES AND GLARING INEQUALITIES OF CONSENSUS REALITY
I WAS IN THE IB PROGRAM IN HIGH SCHOOL THERE WAS A YEAR-LONG COURSE CALLED THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WAS BASICALLY AN INTRODUCTORY SURVEY OF EPISTEMOLOGY I FOUND IT MORE VALUABLE THAN ANY OTHER HS CLASSICAL
REMOVED
PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO ADD THINGS TO THE CURRICULUM BUT NEVER TAKE THINGS OFFICIAL PHILOSOPHY IS GREAT BUT AT THE EXPENSE OF WHAT COURSE ALSO IMO PHYSICAL EDUCATION SHOULD BE A DAILY CORE K CLASSICAL
I'D BE HAPPY JUST TO MAKE COMPETENCY IN CRITICAL THINKING A REQUIREMENT FOR GRADUATION
AT MY SCHOOL IN GERMANY WE CAN CHOOSE WHETHER WE TAKE RELIGION AS A COURSE OR VALUES AND NORMS WHICH IS MOSTLY PHILOSOPHY

THE SAD THING ABOUT IT REALLY IS THE DEPENDENCY OF WHAT TEACHER YOU HAVE FOR A YEAR OR TWO IT WAS JUST MEMORIZING THINGS WITHOUT ACTUALLY THINKING AND DISCUSSING MUCH

RIGHT NOW I HAVE A TEACHER WHO ENCOURAGES THINKING AND EVEN STUDIED PHILOSOPHY AND THE LESSONS ARE REALLY INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING

SADLY THERE ARE SELDOM TEACHERS WHO CAN TEACH RIGHT THINKING PROPERLY BECAUSE MOST TEACHERS ARE JUST HUMANS THAT NEVER LEARNED THAT TYPE OF THINKING THEMSELVES
I TAUGHT AN INTRO TO PHILOSOPHY COURSE TO GRADERS AS AN ELECTIVE FOR TWO YEARS

I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE

SO MANY PEOPLE FEEL AS IF THEY AUTOMATICALLY CAN THINK FOR THEMSELVES BUT OPINION DOES NOT EQUAL RATIONAL THOUGHT ONCE YOU SHOW THE LIBERATING POWER OF RATIONAL THOUGHT TO MOST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THEY'RE CONVINCED AND BECOME INVOLVED IN THE CLASSICAL

IF ANYONE IS CURIOUS ABOUT MY CLASS I WROTE IT FEEL FREE TO AMA
TOOK GRADE PHILOSOPHY DIDN'T LEARN MUCH IT WAS MORE LIKE THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY RATHER THAN ACTUAL PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
WE COULD ALSO JUST HAVE MEDICINE AS A CORE SUBJECT THAT WAY WHEN THE IMAGINARY DINNER CONVERSATION TURNS VIOLENT EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVE THE NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION
YES IT WOULD BE GREAT TO INCLUDE MORE PHILOSOPHY COURSES AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL HOWEVER I ALSO THINK A LESS HISTORY SHOULD BE TAUGHT AS WELL POINT BEING MORE CRITICAL THINKING ABOUT THE HISTORY THAT BORE US EXPOSURE TO CHALLENGING REALITIES

IT'S UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT TO GET HEAVILY INTO PHILOSOPHY SPECIFICALLY SO AS PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING INITIALLY LOGIC CAN BE INTRODUCED ALONG WITH OTHER SUBJECTS SO IT IS GROUNDED AND NOT SO ABSTRACT

PHILOSOPHY CAN BE LIKE ENGLISH LITERATURE YOU HAVE TO WANT TO BE IN THE MINDSET TO HAVE A TEACHER WHO IS SKILLED AT LECTURING AND HAVE ARGUMENTS WITHIN THE CLASSICAL

I NOTICE PEOPLE ARE MAINLY CONCERNED WITH LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING BUT WHAT ABOUT ETHICS AND JUSTICE SOCIETY WOULD BE MUCH BETTER OFF MUDSLINGING MEDIA REACTIONARIES IF WE COULD THINK ABOUT WHAT ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR AND JUSTICE CONSTITUTES
I ONLY DISAGREE FOR TWO PRAGMATIC POINTS IN IMPLEMENTATION HOW COULD AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF TEACHING BE ACHIEVED AND BY WHAT STANDARD WOULD THIS BE JUDGED

I FEAR THAT ANY PHILOSOPHY COURSE IN A COUNTRY WITH A STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM RISKS BECOMING A RELIGIOUS COURSE PUSHING ONLY ONE MAIN STREAM PHILOSOPHY AS AN ABSOLUTE TRUTH
ASSUMING THAT THE SYSTEM IS INTERESTED IN CREATING CRITICAL THINKERS WHICH IT MOST CERTAINLY IS NOT

OK I NEVER BROWSE THIS SUBREDDIT BUT I SAW THIS ON THE FRONT PAGE AND WAS CURIOUS ABOUT IT

I HAVE TO SAY I SORT OF AGREE WITH THE BASIC IDEA I PERSONALLY HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW WHY WHENEVER SOMETHING WAS TAUGHT TO ME AND I THINK IT HAS HELPED ME GREATLY BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD THAT DRAMATICALLY EVEN IF IT DID HAVE SOME IMPACT
BRILLIANT LET'S BURDEN STUDENTS WITH YET ANOTHER COURSE THAT WILL LEAVE THEM UNABLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT WHEN THEY EARN THEIR EVEN NOW ALMOST ENTIRELY USELESS HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA
MY OLDER ROOMMATES ALWAYS CLAIMED TO BE SO MUCH SMARTER IN EVERYTHING I BROUGHT UP YET THEY SAID I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT PHILOSOPHY IS IT'S A WASTE OF CREDIT
I'M DOING IT IN GRADE THOUGH SWITCHED A TECH OUT FOR IT CAUSE I KNEW I'D LIKE IT
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK HERE IN THE COMMENTS ABOUT LOGIC BUT REALLY I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF PHILOSOPHY THAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS IS EPISTEMOLOGY THE STUDY OF KNOWLEDGE ITSELF THE INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE PROGRAM TRIED TO DO THIS BY MAKING A MANDATORY SUBJECT OF OK THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH EXPLORED THE BASICS OF EPISTEMOLOGY AND FORCED STUDENTS TO CONSIDER HOW WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT CAN THAT KNOWLEDGE BE TRUSTED I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA AND SOMETHING EACH OF US SHOULD AT THE VERY LEAST THINK ABOUT AS PART OF FORMAL EDUCATION
I DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH FAITH THAT IT WOULD BE TAUGHT THE WAY IT WOULD NEED TO BE TAUGHT SO I THINK NOT
IF I COULD ONLY ADD ONE THING TO THE CURRICULUM IT WOULD BE LOGIC IF I COULD ADD TWO IT WOULD BE LOGIC AND PHILOSOPHY
CRITICAL THINKING AND LOGIC ARE NECESSARY HOWEVER IT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT NOT MEMORIZED LIKE A LOT OF HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION IS
I ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT THIS GROWING UP IN SCHOOL THERES NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH BEING TAUGHT ABOUT REAL LIFE IN SCHOOLS IN THE US AT LEAST WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE CURRICULUM SOMEHOW
THE ISSUE IS THAT PHILOSOPHY IS SUCH A BROAD TOPIC THAT WITHOUT A SPECIFIED EFFECTIVE CURRICULUM TO FOCUS THE SCOPE AND IDENTIFY THE ESSENTIALS TO TEACH K PHILOSOPHY TEACHING HAS EVERY POTENTIAL TO BECOME A USELESS FLUFF CLASSICAL

I DO THINK PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE TAUGHT PERHAPS TIMES PER WEEK EACH TIME TAKING THE PLACE OF MATH ENGLISH SCIENCE WITH A STRONG FOCUS ON RHETORIC AND RESPONDING TO HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS IN YOUNGER GRADES MOVING INTO THE QUALITIES OF GOOD RHETORIC DEDUCTIVE REASONING LOGIC AND READING OF PHILOSOPHICAL TEXTS IN THE UPPER GRADES

OF COURSE FINDING THE PEOPLE TO TEACH IT WELL IS A WHOLE OTHER PROBLEM
I DOUBT IT'LL LIVE UP TO THE STANDARDS YOU WANT IT TO BE
IN IB I'M TAKING PHILOSOPHY ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE A MANDATORY EPISTEMOLOGY COURSE WHICH I THINK HELPS A GOOD BIT
CERTAIN PARTS OF PHILOSOPHY OR PSYCHOLOGY ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE PART OF IT AT LEAST IF YOU TALKING ABOUT MAKING A PROPERLY EDUCATED POPULATION

A GOVERNMENT WOULD NEVER SUPPORT IT THOUGH IT MAKES LIFE HARDER FOR THEM TO HAVE A SMART OR ENLIGHTENED POPULATION
INTERESTINGLY AT MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WE HAD A LOGIC CLASSICAL NOT REALLY PHILOSOPHY BUT VERY VALUABLE
PHILOSOPHY IS AN OVERWHELMING SUBJECT I GRADUATED TOP IN MY HIGH SCHOOL AND WHEN I TOOK IT IN COLLEGE L STILL STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND IT YOU HAVE TO IMPROVE EDUCATION COMPLETELY IN THE UNITED STATES BEFORE YOU COULD EVER THINK ABOUT ADDING MORE COMPLEX COURSES
PHILOSOPHY IS SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES ACTIVE ENGAGED THINKING TO BE USEFUL NOT MEMORIZING FACTORIES OR JUST DOING WHAT YOUR TEACHER TELLS YOU SO IT'S DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING THAT YOUNG GRADE SHOULD BE EVALUATED ON

THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THEN GETTING YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE TAKING PHILOSOPHY COURSES BECAUSE THEIR SCHOOL MAKES THEM TO ACTUALLY THINK THE CLASS WOULD HAVE TO BE STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T LET PEOPLE GET BY JUST WITH REGURGITATING WHAT A TEACHER SAYS TO ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE THIS MEANS A STRONG BUT UNCONVENTIONAL CURRICULUM AN INTELLIGENT AND OPEN-MINDED TEACHER AND KIDS THAT DON'T LOOK FOR WAYS TO BREAK THE SYSTEM RATHER THAN ACTUALLY LEARNING SOMETHING IN A GOOD CLASSICAL UNFORTUNATELY PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
WHAT A LOAD OF BULLSHIT ADDING ANOTHER SUBJECT TO THE CURRICULUM WON'T MAGICALLY MAKE PEOPLE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE REASONABLE RESPECTFUL DISCOURSE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM ALREADY GIVES PEOPLE THE TOOLS TO GROW INTO THE ADULTS YOU ENVISION TO THE BEST OF ITS ABILITY YET THEY DON'T THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF NOT TEACHING THE RIGHT SUBJECTS IT'S AN ISSUE WITH PEOPLE

IF YOU DID TEACH PHILOSOPHY IN GRADE SCHOOL IT WOULD BECOME A CHORE LIKE MANY HISTORY AND LITERATURE COURSES ROTE MEMORIZATION FOR NO REASON TEACHERS TELLING STUDENTS WHAT TO READ AND STUDENTS THINKING UP WAYS NOT TO READ IT CLASSES THAT FEEL IRRELEVANT TO THE FUTURE OF MANY STUDENTS THE END RESULT WOULD BE THAT FEWER PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER IT AS THAT HORRIBLE BORE FROM THEIR EARLY SCHOOL YEARS

AND ONCE AGAIN TO REITERATE THE REASON PEOPLE DON'T HAVE RATIONAL LOGICAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE BIG ISSUES IS NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE RIGHT CLASSES IN SCHOOL IT'S THAT PEOPLE ARE IDIOTS BY NATURE AND SO ARE YOU FOR THINKING YOU CAN CHANGE THAT FACT BY ADDING PHILOSOPHY COURSES TO GRADE SCHOOL CURRICULA
THOUGH I AGREE PHILOSOPHY IS IMPORTANT I THINK KIDS ALREADY HAVE TOO MUCH SCHOOLING AND OF IT IS JUST BUSY WORK THAT MAKES THEM FALL OUT OF LOVE WITH LEARNING I THINK A SYSTEM OF ROTATING SUBJECTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR MIGHT FIT PHILOSOPHY IN VERY WELL HOWEVER
HERE IN CANADA WE HAVE DEBATE CLASS WHICH IS BASICALLY HAVING A CIVIL DISCUSSION WE DO IT AS A MANDATORY SUBJECT IN GRADES AND AND IN GRADE AND ONWARD IT IS OPTIONAL
I WAS LUCKY TO GET A DECENT MATH CLASS IN THE CA PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM
I HONESTLY DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO LEARN ABOUT PHILOSOPHY IN ANY REGARD UNTIL THEIR BRAINS HAVE FULLY MATURED INDOCTRINATING A CHILD INTO A BELIEF SYSTEM SHOULD BE A CRIMINAL ACT AS MUCH AS CERTAIN PHILOSOPHERS ENCOURAGE FREE THINKING I CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND MAKING A KID GO TO CHURCH WHEN THEY'RE THEY ARE TOO YOUNG TO FULLY GRASP THE INFORMATION AND YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS TO FORCE THEM INTO YOUR POV
EDITS PUNCTUATION
I TAUGHT A HIGH SCHOOL LOGIC COURSE FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE KIDS LOVED IT AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH TROUBLE PICKING IT UP DESPITE THE INITIAL CONCERNS ADMIN HAD I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO ASK FOR THOUGH A LOGIC COURSE INSTEAD OF A PHILOSOPHY COURSE PHILOSOPHY FOCUSES ON SPECIFIC ISSUES WHILE LOGIC IS WHAT GIVES YOU THE ACTUAL TOOLS FOR THINKING K KIDS OBVIOUSLY NEED THE LATTER FIRST

ALSO I'M NOTICING A LOT OF THE BIBLE BELT IS KEEPING PHILOSOPHY AWAY FROM US COMMENTS AND WHILE I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY SOME TRUTH THEM ONE OF THE JUSTIFIED FEARS IS THAT EDUCATORS WILL MISTAKE TEACHING PHILOSOPHY FOR TEACHING EXCLUSIVELY ATHEISTIC PHILOSOPHY THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM WITH THIS IN HIGHER ED AND THE WEIRD PART IS THAT IT'S OFTEN DONE BY THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE QUICK TO DECRY ANY PROSELYTIZING WITH THAT IN MIND I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERN
STRANGE POST PHILOSOPHY IN ITSELF IS A QUITE A DIFFICULT AND SPECIALIZED FIELD OF STUDY THAT WILL BE DEFINITELY HARD TO EXAMINE IN SMALLER GRADES AND ALSO WHAT WOULD THEY DO IT'S LIKE SAYING SHOULD BE TAUGHT K IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
I WAS IN A PILOT PROGRAM THAT TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

IT WAS AWFUL

LOOKING BACK NOW JUST AREN'T READY TO ENGAGE IN FORMALIZED PHILOSOPHY EDUCATION IN A CLASSROOM OR GROUP SETTING THE PATIENCE EMOTIONAL MATURITY AND INTELLECTUAL TOOLS JUST AREN'T THERE

I'M NOT SAYING YOUNG CHILDREN CAN'T ENGAGE IN PHILOSOPHY I'M SAYING A CONVENTIONAL CLASSROOM SETTING IS THE WORST POSSIBLE PLACE TO DO IT

TEACH LANGUAGE SKILLS MATH SCIENCE AND ALL THE OTHER BUILDING BLOCKS ONTO WHICH YOU CAN TEACH PHILOSOPHY LATER
I DON'T AGREE PERSONALLY I SUPPORT EDUCATION GOING IN A LESS STATIC DIRECTION WHERE SCIENCE AND MATH ARE THE ONLY REQUIRED LEARNING PAST GRADE EVERYTHING ELSE SHOULD BE OPTIONAL

IM NOT SURE WHAT KNOWLEDGE PEOPLE HERE ACTUALLY HAVE OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM BUT IN GENERAL THE SYSTEM GOES TOO BROAD ALREADY AND STUDIES ARE SHOWING THE FAILURE RATE CAUSED BY IT AKA THE FEELING THAT ALOT OF CLASSES ARE POINTLESS OR THE FEELING THAT YOU LACK DIRECTION AND CHOICE
POWER RELIES ON THE IGNORANCE OF ITS AGENTS WITHOUT IGNORANCE POWER CAN'T BE ENFORCED AS EASILY

PHILOSOPHY ISN'T A CORE CURRICULUM IN K BECAUSE OUR OPPRESSORS DON'T WANT CRITICALLY THINKING INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WHO CAN RATIONALLY COME TO CONCLUSIONS FOR THEMSELVES
THE KIND OF PHILOSOPHY I'VE SEEN IS NOT APPEALING TO ME AT ALL I'M ALL FOR A CLASS THAT TEACHES REAL CRITICAL THINKING AND RATIONALITY BUT PHILOSOPHY SEEMS TO BE ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER
AS AN ELEMENTARY TEACHER NUMBER YOU FIND THE TIME FOR THAT WITHOUT TAKING AWAY MORE OF THEIR FREE TIME THEN GREAT BUT YOU WON'T WITHOUT LENGTHENING THE SCHOOL DAY AND NO CHILDREN DON'T NEED TO KNOW PHILOSOPHY AT AN AGE WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW MOST OF THE WORDS THEY WOULD HAVE TO READ ALSO THEY CAN'T READ

WE HAVE PHILOSOPHY CLASSES IN FRANCE PRETTY MUCH USELESS GIVES YOU A PHILOSOPHICAL BACKGROUND AT BEST THEY TEACH YOU THE CORE BUT DON'T HAVE TIME TO DISCUSS IT WICH DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE

IT'S NOT ABOUT TEACHING PHILOSOPHY BUT MORE ABOUT HOW YOU TEACH EVERYTHING ELSE
MAYBE LATER IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT THE BRAIN REALLY DOESN'T DEVELOP VERY QUICKLY AND IT'S WHY CHILDREN STRUGGLE WITH SIMPLE MATHEMATICS TRYING TO SHOEHORN MORE SUBJECTS IN AT AN EARLY AGE MAY DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD I WOULD AGREE THAT PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE AN ASPECT OF HISTORY AND LOGIC AS AN ASPECT OF MATH AND COMPUTER LESSONS
I FEEL THE SAME WAY EXCEPT WITH INFERENTIAL STATISTICS

MY FRESHMAN ENGLISH TEACHER IN HIGH SCHOOL GAVE US A UNIT ON PHILOSOPHY COMPLETELY AGAINST THE CURRICULUM JUST BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT AFTERWARDS I SAW THE IMPORTANCE OF IT

THE WAY HE DESCRIBED PHILOSOPHY WAS AS PUSHUPS FOR THE BRAIN JUST LIKE YOU'D DO PUSHUPS TO CONDITION YOUR BODY TO ENCELL IN ANY SPORT YOU'D STUDY PHILOSOPHY TO CONDITION YOUR MIND TO THINK CRITICALLY

THANK YOU MR LINE
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT LOGICAL DISCUSSION PHILOSOPHY FORMS A FOUNDATION FOR BOTH SCIENCE AND MATHS UNDERSTANDING PHILOSOPHY HELPS WITH UNDERSTANDING THE LATER TWO ALONG WITH A HOST OF OTHER SUBJECTS
YOUR EXAMPLE OF THE BEFORE AFTER OF PHILOSOPHY ISN'T EVEN CORRECT IN THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE STUDIES THAT DIRECTLY SHOW BOTH RESULTS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION THE ONE PLACE WHERE THERE IS AGREEMENT IS THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION DOES NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE EMPLOYMENT OF AMERICANS IE FOR LANDSCAPING CONSTRUCTION ETC ABOVE THAT THEN THAT IS WHERE THERE ISN'T CONSENSUS

I THINK A LOGIC TYPE OF PHILOSOPHY CLASS MIGHT COULD WORK IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE ONE EVERY YEAR NUMBER
PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO THINK OVER THE COURSE OF A DECENT HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION THE PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE STILL OVERVALUE THEIR INTUITION AND IF PEOPLE LEARNED TO REJECT THEIR INTUITION AND RELY ON REASON MOST WOULD NEVER GO ANY FARTHER THAN CONTRARIANISM SEE PHILOSOPHY UNDERGRADS LIBERTARIANS
WE ALREADY GET THOSE LESSONS THROUGH OTHER SUBJECTS MATH SCIENCE TEACHES LOGIC ENGLISH PUBLIC SPEAKING TEACHES FALLACIES AND ARGUMENTATIVE LOGIC AND SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHES EFFECTS OF THE GROUP ON THE INDIVIDUAL THE LESSON IS THERE JUST NOT AS OBVIOUS AS YOU'D LIKE
THE NONEXISTENCE OF A CORE PHILOSOPHY CLASS IS NOT WHAT MAKES OUR COUNTRY THE US STUPID AND BIGOTED IT IS THE LACK OF ADEQUATE EDUCATION UNDERSTANDING AND A GENERATIONAL GAP THAT CREATES SUCH PEOPLE

AT MY HIGH SCHOOL ALMOST EVERYBODY IN MY AP CLASSES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY AP CLASSES ARE REASONABLE WHEN ARGUING ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS JOBS AND SUCH THEY DON'T SAY WE NEED TO BUILD A FUCKING WALL RIGHT NOW OUT OF NOWHERE THEY'RE REASONABLE AND QUESTION THE IMPACT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS INSTEAD BEFORE TALKING MORE ABOUT IT

ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN I GO TO A CLASS WITH LOWER EXPECTATIONS SUCH AS DIGITAL MEDIA AND GO BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT TRUMP OR WHATEVER NOBODY REALLY SEEMS TO ASK QUESTIONS THEY JUST THROW A BUNCH OF STATEMENTS AT EACH OTHER UNTIL THE CLASS ENDS

SIMILARLY I NOTICE A TREND OF BIGOTRY WITH AGED PEOPLE I WORK AS A CASHIER AND MEET HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE A DAY OCCASIONALLY GETTING CONVERSATIONS ON POLITICS AND ON THE TV I OFTEN HEAR YOUNGER PEOPLE IN THEIR SAY THAT POLICE BEATINGS AND SHOOTINGS OF BLACK PEOPLE ARE JUST SIMPLY WRONG ON THE OFFICERS PART WHILE OLDER PEOPLE PERHAPS IN THEIR SAY THAT THE OFFICER HAD THE RIGHT TO BEAT OR SHOOT THE GUY UP I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE POLICE ARE WRONG OR RIGHT TO DO THIS I'M JUST NOTICING AN INTERESTING TREND

MY AP US HISTORY TEACHER ALSO TOLD US ABOUT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS THAT SERVED IN WWII AND HOW HIS FRIEND ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT STAND JAPANESE PEOPLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE JAPANESE HE SAID THAT HE BELIEVED THE PROPAGANDA THAT PORTRAYED JAPANESE AS ENEMIES BACK IN THE DAY HAD A LARGE IMPACT IN HIS VIEW OF THE JAPANESE WE DON'T HAVE ANY SORT OF PROPAGANDA LIKE THAT TODAY AND IT ALSO SEEMS THAT NO YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A NEGATIVE OPINION ON JAPANESE PEOPLE TODAY EITHER

THERE'S JUST NO NEED FOR A K PHILOSOPHY CLASS IN MY OPINION IF PEOPLE CAN JUST TAKE MORE DIFFICULT CLASSES THEY WOULD NATURALLY LEARN TO ANALYZE AND THINK CRITICALLY THE PROBLEM IS MOST OLDER PEOPLE ARE NOT COMING BACK TO SCHOOL JUST TO UNLEARN THEIR BIGOTRY

WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY DIE OUT AND MILLENNIAL TAKE OVER
IF YOU TAUGHT PHILOSOPHY TOO EARLY YOU WOULD PRODUCE OPPOSITIONAL RATHER THAN IMPRESSIONABLE STUDENTS THE LAST THING TEACHERS WANT IS A CLASSROOM FULL OF LITTLE PHILOSOPHERS BECAUSE IF LITERALLY EVERY STUDENT BEHAVED LIKE LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN CLASS WOULD MOVE AT A SNAILS PACE AND CAPITALISM MIGHT NO LONGER BE POSSIBLE AS QUESTIONING REDUCED THE SYSTEM TO RUINS THAT IS WHAT'S SO ANNOYING ABOUT EDUCATION BALANCING OUT THE SUBMISSIVE ACT OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE AGGRESSIVE ACT OF QUESTIONING AND HENCE CONFUSING

WHEN WE WATCH THE FIRST EPISODE OF RICK AND MORTY WE LAUGH AT THE FIRST EPISODE WHERE RICK SAYS THAT SCHOOL ISN'T A PLACE FOR SMART PEOPLE BECAUSE IT ISN'T INTELLIGENCE WILL MAKE YOU INDOLENT FOR IT USES INTELLIGENCE TO SAVE THE BODY CALORIES BUT A WORLD WHERE EVERYONE'S A SOPHIST IS A WORLD WHERE NOTHING GETS DONE YOU CAN THINK OF CHRISTIANITY AS THE ANSWER TO OR EVEN EXPLOITATION OF THAT COLLECTIVE SOCIAL HABIT OF RELISHING OUR FEAR AND IDLENESS WHERE FEAR WAS TURNED AROUND AS A MECHANISM HELL FOR TERRORIZING PEOPLE INTO SUBSERVIENCE UNDER THE THREAT OF TORTURE THE SCHOOLS WE HAVE TODAY ARE LIGHTER COPIES OF THE SCHOOLS OF RHETORIC THAT PRODUCED THEM IN THE DARK AGES IT IS A SAD FACT OF THE WORLD THAT PROGRESS WAS POSSIBLE THROUGH CRUELTY AND THAT WISDOM SERVES THE WEALTHY
FROM A PERSON THAT STUDIES A MATH RELATED FIELD YES IT DOES TEACHES YOU HOW TO THINK LOGICALLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME ALIENATES YOU FROM THE CONCRETE WORLD

I STUDIED PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND HISTORY OF ART IN HIGH SCHOOL AND ENJOYED IT I AM NOT IN THE US EVEN THOUGH WE SIMPLY HAD TO MEMORIZE WHO SAID WHAT IN ORDER TO PASS THE TESTAMENT I AM REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND CAN AFFIRM THAT IT HELPED WITH CRITICAL THINKING WE HAVE A SOCIETY BASED IN MINDLESS CONSUMERISM AND EMPTY VALUES AND IT IS PRETTY EASY TO FALL IN THAT TRAP DEPENDING ON YOUR FAMILY EDUCATION BACKGROUND
I AGREE BUT YOUR GOING TO HAVE TO CONVINCE A SCREAMING MOB OF CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND POLITICAL EXTREMISTS WHO HAVE NO DESIRE FOR A LOGICAL AND RATIONAL GENERATION
THIS SOUNDS LIKE CRITICAL THINKING BUT A TAD BEYOND TO EXAMINE ALL OF YOUR OWN THOUGHTS TO FIND THEIR MARROW AS FOR MORALITY THE WOMEN OF THE WORLD TEACH THE SAME THREE THINGS EVERYWHERE TELL THE TRUTH DO NOT TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS AND HELP THOSE SMALLER OR WEAKER THAN YOURSELF NO PHILOSOPHY RELIGION OR CREED HAS YET TO IMPROVE ON THESE SIMPLE UNIVERSAL TEACHINGS
WHEN I WAS A SOPHOMORE IN HS WE STUDIED PHILOSOPHY FOR A WHOLE SEMESTER IN ENGLISH PLUS SUMMER IF YOU INCLUDE THE SUMMER READING PROJECT IT COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE
RIGHT NOW I'M A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR TAKING THE FIRST PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY CLASS TO RUN IN ANY HIGH SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S BEEN A VERY INTERESTING CLASS WITH A GOOD TIE IN BETWEEN THEM THE CLASS IS ONLY AN ELECTIVE THOUGH
PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE A CORE K CLASS SO THAT EVERYBODY WITH A OPINION THINKS IT'S WORTH PUTTING INTO WRITING
I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVER SINCE I STARTED READING PHILOSOPHY ON MY OWN TIME WE LEARN OR MEMORIZE INFORMATION IN THE STATES BUT PHILOSOPHY CAN TRAIN YOUR MIND TO REASON PROPERLY AND DISCOVER NEW THINGS
THE THING ABOUT SCHOOL IS THAT IT DOESNT CREATE THINKERS IT TRAINS FUTURE EMPLOYEES SO THEY DONT WANT PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINKING FOR THEMSELVES

FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE BENEFITS THAT WOULD COME OUT OF A MORE WIDESPREAD UNDERSTANDING OF PHILOSOPHY IS CHANGING THE WAY MORE PEOPLE RESPOND TO DISAGREEMENTS AND CONFLICTING IDEOLOGY
NO MATTER HOW STRANGE ANOTHER PERSON'S BEHAVIOR OR BELIEF MAY SEEM AT FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THERE MAY BE AN UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY WORLD-VIEW WHICH SUPPORTS IT WHILE IT IS EASY TO JUDGE ANOTHER PERSON BY OUR OWN WE WILL HAVE BETTER JUDGEMENT AND LESS SENSELESS CONFLICT WHEN WE ATTEMPT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THEIRS AS WELL

AS IT IS I DON'T THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE EVEN RECOGNIZE THE ROLE THAT IDEOLOGY PLAYS IN THEIR OWN DECISIONS OR SEEK TO BE INTERNALLY CONSISTENT
WHILE I DON'T HAVE A STRONG IDEA OF WHAT GRADES IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A PHILOSOPHY CLASS IN I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THERE IS VALUABLE UNDERSTANDING WHICH ISN'T BEING IMPARTED UNDER MOST MANDATORY CURRICULUMS
I HAVE A PHILOSOPHY CLASS AND I AM IN GRADE
FANTASTIC POST I'VE BEEN THINKING THE SAME THING FOR YEARS AND HAVE INTRODUCED PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS TO MY TEEN CHILDREN SINCE GRADE SCHOOL I USUALLY STARTED WITH SOME NOTION OF WHAT THEY CONSIDERED REALITY AND INTRODUCED ALTERNATIVES IN ADDITION TO CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS OF COURSE THEY LOVED DISCUSSING EASY CONCEPTS LIKE THE TROLLEY PROBLEM AND HOW IT REPRESENTED DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF JUSTICE MY ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE WAS TO DISPEL ANY IDEAS OF FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVITY


I CAN'T BELIEVE SOME OF THE RESPONSES TO YOUR POST BUT I REALIZE MOST OF YOUR DETRACTORS ARE PROBABLY JUST STARTING OUT IN ADULTHOOD AND HAVEN'T YET ACQUIRED THE LIFE EXPERIENCES TO TEMPER THEIR POSITIONS A FEW GOOD RESPONSES THOUGH


SOMEONE NEEDS TO THIS SUB AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MIGHT ACTUALLY BE IN A POSITION TO MAKE THIS SORT OF CHANGE IN AN AMERICAN CURRICULUM WOULD QUICKLY TURN AWAY FROM THIS THREAD AFTER BEING BOMBARDED WITH SOME OF THESE POSTS I MISS THE DAYS
THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AS WE WOULD DISCARD CAPITALISM AND THE ASSOCIATED CAPITALISTIC SOCIOPATHY NARCISSISM AND GREED SO FAST AND WE JUST CAN'T HAVE THAT NOW CAN WE PUBLIC EDUCATION ISN'T ABOUT EDUCATION IT'S ABOUT FEEDING UNQUESTIONING DRONES INTO THE SYSTEM
I DISAGREE I THINK NO MATTER WHAT THE SUBJECT CLASS WILL ALWAYS BE ABOUT LEARNING THE VOCABULARY PASSING TESTS AND SHOWING YOU AGREE WITH THE TEACHER PROFS OPINION
HISTORY SHOULD BE AN ELECTIVE

WE'VE ALL GOT OUR OWN OPINIONS
WE NEED MORE EMPATHY THAT'S THE PROBLEM

SCHOOL SHOULD TEACH STUDENTS THE NATURE OF THINKING

MATHS COULD HELP BUT NOW IT IS KNOWN ONLY AS THEOREMS AND NOTIONS
HAVING HOUR PER WEEK OF PHILOSOPHY COULD INDEED CREATE MORE INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS AND DEBATES BUT IT SHOULD REALLY BE FOCUSING ON THE THINKING PART AND ABYE SOME PHILOSOPHY HISTORY TO SUPPORT THE THINKING EXCERSISES WHY DID THINKER THINK THIS IN THIS TIME PERIOD

IF ITS JUST PHILOSOPHY HISTORY IT DOESNT ADD MUCH TO THE EDUCATION LEVEL IN MY OPINION
A MOST FASCINATING TOPIC YET IT IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER SO MUCH SO THAT I DON'T THINK IT CAN HAPPEN IN PUBLIC SCHOOL PRIVATE SCHOOL MAY BE A BETTER VENUE YET EVEN THERE ONE WOULD RUN INTO MAJOR PROBLEMS

THE DANGER BECOMES MANIFEST IN MANY WAYS FOR INSTANCE

A CLASS THAT ENCOURAGES LARGELY PHILOSOPHICAL TYPE THINKING BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE TEACHING EVERYONE ABOUT CERTAIN PHILOSOPHY NICHES AND THE FULL UNDERSTANDING OF CERTAIN THINGS WITHIN PHILOSOPHY IF THAT MAKES SENSE

THIS ANGLE IS DOMINATED BY A CONCEIT NAMELY THAT THERE IS SOME TRADITION FREE PURE PHILOSOPHICAL THING WE CAN GET AT OR IS JUST REIFIED AS OUT THERE WITHOUT ANY HISTORICAL REFERENT ALSO IT CONCEALS AN HISTORICAL THING AS IF IT ISN'T ONE I EAST THE POSITING OF A CHORISTOMA SOMETHING EPIKEIA TES OUSIA AS THOUGH THIS IS SIMPLY NATURAL AND NONPROBLEMATIC AT THE SAME TIME THE REVERSE THAT IS TO INSIST THERE ARE ONLY HISTORICALLY ROOTED NARRATIVES AND NOTHING REALLY TRANSCENDENT LIKEWISE FOULS THE ENGINE

THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO GET STARTED

AND SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE IDEA OF TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL I THINK ONE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THIS PROBLEM ITSELF A PART OF THE TEACHING HOW DO WE START WITH PHILOSOPHY HOW DOES PHILOSOPHY GET STARTED

OF COURSE THE SHIFT TO HOW DID PHILOSOPHY GET STARTED SUGGESTS ITSELF NATURALLY ENOUGH AND SO WE'RE FORCED RATHER EARLY TO GET INTO FIGURES LIKE PLATO AND ARISTOTLE

THE DANGERS ONLY MULTIPLY AND GO DEEPER AND DEEPER THEN THE PUBLIC WILL GO ON ABOUT THE WHITE EURO MALE TANGENT IF THEY NOTICE THE PECULIAR TAKE ON EROS IN THE SYMPOSIUM HELL IS JUST WAITING TO BREAK LOOSE FASTER IN PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT INEVITABLE INSOFAR AS PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IS ENSHRINED THE FRACTAL NOISE OF OUTRAGE CULTURE WILL ALREADY BLOW UP THE PROJECT BEFORE WE GET TO DISTURBING TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS

SOME IDEAS ARE PREDOMINANTLY BASED IN LOGIC LOGIC DOESN'T DICTATE ALL IDEAS IF I SAID THAT ALL HUMANS HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE HUMAN DAMMIT THERE IS NO LOGIC TO THAT BUT IT'S NOT ILLOGICAL EITHER

THE COMMENT ABOVE IS PREGNANT WITH A MYRIAD OF ABYSMAL VECTORS HUMAN RIGHTS ARE A SACROSANCT THING IN OUR CULTURE BUT YOU CAN'T SEE THEM WITH EITHER A MICROSCOPE OR THE HUBBLE TELESCOPE WITHOUT GOING INTO THE HORRIFYING DETAILS IT'S DAMN CERTAIN THE PARENTS WILL PHREAK SOME SERIOUS SHIT IF IT STARTS GOING ON IN HIGH SCHOOL

STILL THERE JUST HAS TO BE A WAY

EARLIER AND EARLIER KIDS ARE ZONED INTO A WASH OF FACTORIES NARRATIVES IMAGES A TSUNAMI OF INFORMATION AND PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKE CITIZENS THAN CONSUMERS THE TERM MORE AND MORE APPEARS TO POINT TO A REALLY REAL THING PEOPLE COULD NOT SEE AS IN PERCEIVE THAT GEORGE W BUSH WAS MANIFESTING AN INFERIOR INTELLECTUAL PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THAT TRUMP IS A SOPHISTICAL WELTER OF NONSENSE PEOPLE THINK SAM HARRIS IS SOME KIND OF PHILOSOPHER

AND YET WE LIVE IN A WORLD WITH SUCH POWERS AND ATTENDANT DUTIES THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD THIS FRIGHTFUL MENTAL DEGRADATION A CONFECTION OF SORTS THAT'S EVEN MORE GROSS WHEN SPRINKLED WITH SCIENCE GLITTER

FORTUNATELY THE SCENE IN ANCIENT GREECE WAS BOILING WITH SOME ANTECEDENTS AND IN A REACTION TO THOSE WE SEE SOMETHING STRANGE BEGIN TO TRANSPIRE

IT IS ONLY WHEN ALL THESE THINGS NAMES AND DEFINITIONS VISUAL AND OTHER SENSATIONS ARE RUBBED TOGETHER AND SUBJECTED TO TESTS IN WHICH QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE EXCHANGED IN GOOD FAITH AND WITHOUT MALICE THAT FINALLY WHEN HUMAN CAPACITY IS STRETCHED TO ITS LIMIT A SPARK OF UNDERSTANDING AND INTELLIGENCE FLASHES OUT AND ILLUMINATES THE MATTER AT HAND 7TH LETTER








AND TO THINK THAT IN CHILE MY COUNTRY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION WANTS TO REMOVE PHILOSOPHY AS A SUBJECT WE ONLY HAVE THIS SUBJECT THE LAST 2 YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL
SOURCE
LOGIC SHOULD BE
I AGREE MOVE RELIGION TO BE A LITTLE PART OF HISTORY AND ADD PHILOSOPHY AS MAJOR
ECONOMICS TOO
ATTEMPTS TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION HAVE BEEN UNDERSTANDABLY MISERABLE THUS FAR
PERHAPS IT COULD BE AN ELECTIVE TO TAKE BUT AS IT STANDS THE REQUIRED CLASSES ARE JUST TOO SET IN STONE AND IMPORTANT TO ME ANYWAY TO WARRANT SUCH A DRASTIC CHANGE
I TOTALLY AGREE HOWEVER BEFORE THAT KIDS NEED TO LEARN TO READ WRITE AND HAVE JUST THE BASIC OF MATHEMATICS BEFORE BEING GIVEN LESSONS IN PHILOSOPHY


OBS BEFORE ANYONE SAYS ANYTHING I AM ALWAYS IN FAVOR OF KIDS LEARNING NEW STUFF BUT THEY NEED BASICS SORTED OUT FIRST
I TOOK PHILOSOPHY FRESHMEN YEAR OF COLLEGE PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT TOO IT WAS TERRIBLE MOST OF THE TIME WAS SPENT LEARNING ABOUT OLD PHILOSOPHERS AND THEIR CATCH PHRASES WHICH SURE I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT BUT THERE WAS NO ACTUAL DISCUSSION NO CRITICAL THINKING EXAMS CONSISTED OF EXPLAIN THIS COMMON SENSE CONCEPT USING THIS FANCY WORDED COMMON SENSE CONCEPT COINED BY THIS GUY A YEARS AGO BONUS POINTS IF YOU FLUFF UP YOUR LANGUAGE LIKE A TEEN TRYING DESPERATELY TO SOUND INTELLIGENT AS FUCK JUST UNBELIEVABLY PRETENTIOUS AND A WASTE OF TIME KIND OF REMINDS YOU OF A CERTAIN SUB EH I'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT LIFE DURING ONE NIGHT SHARING A COUPLE BEERS WITH FRIENDS THAN I EVER DID OVER A SEMESTER OF PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHY MUCH LIKE PSYCHOLOGY WISHES TO COMPARTMENTALIZE BASIC HUMAN EMOTIONS INTO THEOREMS IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN HOW WE ACT WHICH DOESN'T SOUND HALF BAD ON PAPER PROBLEM IS HUMANS ARE SO COMPLEX AND DO THINGS FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT REASONS THAT REFERENCING A SIMPLE PRINCIPLE THEOREM AND CALLING IT A DAY IS A WOEFULLY INADEQUATE WAY TO DISCUSS THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE YOU DON'T NEED TO REFERENCE PLATO OR FREUD IN ORDER TO HAVE A GOOD DISCUSSION JUST CONVERSE BACK UP YOUR IDEAS WITH SOUND REASONING EXPLAIN YOURSELF CLEARLY AND SUCCINCTLY BE OPEN TO IDEAS AND HAVE AT IT THE GOAL IS TO EXCHANGE IDEAS NOT BOOST YOUR EGO BY NAME DROPPING THEORIES THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVEN'T HEARD OF
PHILOSOPHY CAN EDUCATE YOU ON DIFFERENT WAYS OF THINKING BUT ALMOST CERTAINLY DOES NOTHING FOR ELIMINATING AD HOMINEM FROM SOMEONE WHO IS INCLINED TO INSULT IN AN ARGUMENT TO BEGIN WITH

ALSO ANECDOTALLY I WAS INTRODUCED TO PHILOSOPHY THROUGH MY HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH DEPARTMENT INSTEAD OF REQUIRING PHILOSOPHY COURSES IT MAY BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO TAKE A CLASS THAT HAS PHILOSOPHICAL COMPONENTS OR AN INSTRUCTOR THAT IS COMFORTABLE BRINGING PHILOSOPHY INTO OTHER READINGS THAT ARE TO BE COMPLETED BUT YEAH I AGREE WITH YOU OP INSOFAR AS PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE PUSHED TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN IT CURRENTLY IS BEFORE GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO TAKE THREE HIGH SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY CLASSES ONE WAS CALLED THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH I THINK WAS AN INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE SUBJECT EDIT YEP THE TEACHER HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS DOING WE BASICALLY READ THE TEXTBOOK THE SECOND INTRO TO PHILOSOPHY HIGH SCHOOL CLASS I TOOK WAS AN ACTUAL TEACHER BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE CURRICULUM WAS IB LEVEL WE READ THE NOVEL WORLD AND SUPPLEMENTED THAT BASIC WESTERN PHILOSOPHY INSTRUCTION WITH EASTERN PHILOSOPHY CURRICULUM THAT I REMEMBER LESS WELL THE THIRD CLASS WAS A GENERIC NORTH AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL CLASS AND WE DID DO A UNIT OF BASIC LOGIC FALLACIES AND FORMULAS HOWEVER WHAT I REMEMBER BEST ABOUT THAT CLASS WERE THE STUDY PARTIES FOR THE POT AND THE SPIN THE BOTTLE
READING SOME OF THESE COMMENTS THIS THREAD IS LIKE THE PERFECT WINDOW TO THE SOUL OF REDDIN

THIS SHOULD BE IT'S WARNING SIGN FOR NEWCOMERS


I PERSONALLY THINK THEIR ARE A LOT OF OTHER CLASSES THAT NEED TO SHOW UP IN CORE EDUCATION BEFORE PHILOSOPHY SPECIFICALLY ON FINANCES AND TECHNOLOGY MOST PEOPLE WILL GET MORE PRACTICAL VALUE FROM THOSE TYPES OF CLASSES I'D PUT PHILOSOPHY PRETTY LOW ON THE LIST AND I DEFINITELY DON'T SEE IT'S AS IMPORTANT AS MATH SCIENCE ETC
THIS WOULD BE AMAZING GRANTED IT'S ACTUAL DISCUSSION AND NOT A MEMORIZE XYZ BY MONDAY CLASS
PHILOSOPHY MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE TO STUDENTS IN K BECAUSE OF THEIR INEXPERIENCE IN LIFE THE TOPICS OF PHILOSOPHY SUCH AS CRITICAL THINKING AND LOGIC HOWEVER ARE TAUGHT IN READING COMPREHENSION FOR K AND ARE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE NEW COMMON CORE
I COMPLETELY AGREE I ACTUALLY WROTE AN ARTICLE ABOUT THIS WHEN I WAS ON MY HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPER SEVERAL TEACHERS AND STUDENTS CAME UP TO ME AND SAID HOW THEY AGREED OF COURSE NOTHING HAPPENED BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM WORKS
REPUBLICANS WOULD NEVER TOLERATE THAT

FIRST OF ALL IT WOULD REQUIRE TEACHERS WHO HAVE TO BE PAID WHICH MEANS THEM PAYING TAXES AND REPUBLICANS DON'T BELIEVE IN PAYING TAXES

SECOND OF ALL IT WOULD LEAD TO PEOPLE THINKING AND REPUBLICANS DON'T LIKE ELITISTS WHO THINK

IN CZECH REPUBLIC WE DO HAVE MANDATORY PHILOSOPHY IT'S REALLY AWFUL THE TEACHER TELLS YOU THE NAME AND BASIC PHILOSOPHY OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AND YOU LEARN IT FOR THE TESTAMENT AS FAR AS I HEARD IT'S THE SAME CASE IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS JUST REALLY AREN'T QUALIFIED TO TEACH IT ALSO YOU HAVE PRETTY SHORT TIME TO TEACH A PRETTY LONG LIST OF PHILOSOPHERS SO YOU CAN'T REALLY DISCUSS IT OR GO INTO DEPTH

I HONESTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT PHILOSOPHY UNTIL COLLEGE I OFTEN HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE ABOUT HOW USEFUL IT WAS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS MORE OFTEN ABOUT MATHEMATICS SINCE I'M MATHEMATICIAN AND I MOST OFTEN SPEAK WITH OTHER MATHEMATICIANS AND WE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS AGREED THAT IT DIDN'T REALLY HELP BOTH IN THE BIBLE PHILIPPIANS AND MATH

IT SEEMED TO US THAT THE REASON PHILOSOPHY AND MATHEMATICS AREN'T REALLY HELPING STUDENTS TO THINK IS THAT THE TEACHERS ARE JUST SHITTY AND THERE REALLY JUST AREN'T GONNA BE ENOUGH GOOD TEACHERS FOR THIS SYSTEM TO EVEN REMOTELY WORK IT KINDA SEEMS LIKE ALL THE WARS WOULD END IF ONLY PEOPLE DECIDED TO BE NICE TO EACH OTHER IT SEEMS COOL IN THEORY BUT IT JUST ISN'T GONNA WORK SO BY ADDING MANDATORY PHILOSOPHY CLASS THE ONLY THINK THAT'S GONNA CHANGE IS THAT REGULAR PEOPLE WILL START HATE IT IN A SIMILAR FASHION THEY HATE MATHEMATICS

ANYWAY THAT'S MY OPINION
I DON'T THINK THAT PHILOSOPHY SHOULD A BE CORE COURSE FROM K BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE FOR GRADE BECAUSE WHEN I TOOK IT IN GRADE IT REALLY RESHAPED MY MIND AND FOR THE BETTER BEFORE I WEN INTO UNIVERSITY MOSTLY BECAUSE IT WAS ALL OPINIONS BECAUSE I GOT THE CHANCE TO EXPRESS MY OWN BELIEFS I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE FLAWS OF MY OWN MIND AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO THINK BETTER EVEN THOUGH MOST OF MY JOURNALS WERE LAST MINUTE I ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND REALLY PUT MY OPINIONS ON THE PAPER AND LOOKING BACK AT THE JOURNALS MY OPINIONS HAVE CHANGED A LOT AND FOR THE BETTER
WHAT A HEAP YOU WANT EVERY HUMAN TO TAKE PHILOSOPHY SO THAT WE CAN ALL DISCUSS IN AN ORGANISED WAY WHO CARES WE CAN ARGUE IF WE ALL WANT TO WE DON'T ALL HAVE TO AGREE OR DO IT LIKE ROBOTS OR EVEN HAVE A POINT WHAT A MEANINGLESS THING TO STRIVE FOR
MEANWHILE I AGREE I HAVE TO SAY THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE UNTEACHABLE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO NOT TO THINK THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM WE HAD A STRONGLY RELIGIOUS INDIVIDUAL IN OUR CHOSEN CLASS OF PHILOSOPHY HE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND PHYSICS GRADE GERMANY AND CHOSE PHILOSOPHY NORMALLY STRONG RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WERE NO PROBLEM AS OUR TEACHER WAS GOOD AT EXPLAINING THAT LEARNING ABOUT PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS AND THEORIES IS JUST ENTERTAINING AN IDEA BUT HE WAS UNTEACHABLE AND HELD STRONG ONTO HIS SINCEREST BELIEFS EVEN WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO JUST DO IT FOR THE THEORIES SAKE
PROMOTION OF CRITICAL THINKING IN GENERAL SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED NOT JUST PHILOSOPHY
I HAVE A GOOD STORY THAT RELATES TO THIS OP I HOPE YOU READ IT I'LL START BY SAYING THAT FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY YOUTH I WAS A SHITTY STUDENT I HAD BAD GRADES BUT I DID WELL ON TESTS I JUST LIKED BEING OUTSIDE DOING MY OWN THING FUCK HOMEWORK AFTER SWITCHING SCHOOLS A COUPLE OF TIMES BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND A PLACE I FIT INTO WHERE I WOULDN'T FIGHT WITH TEACHERS CONSTANTLY I FINALLY ENROLLED MYSELF AT THE ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL WHEN I TURNED THIS WAS UNUSUAL FOR ME GOING FROM THE KID WHO ACTIVELY AVOIDED SCHOOL AT ALL COSTS TO ADMITTING THAT I NEEDED TO MAKE SOMETHING OF MYSELF AND ELECTING TO GET MY COLLECTIVE SHIT TOGETHER ANYWHY MY FIRST YEAR THERE WAS ALSO THE FIRST YEAR FOR THE NEW ENGLISH TEACHER DURING OUR FIRST CLASS WE ALL SAT AROUND AND DISCUSSED WHAT WE DID AND DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT TYPICAL ENGLISH CLASSES FOR MOST KIDS IT WAS THE TEDIOUS REPETITIVE CRAP WE'RE EACH YEAR A LOT OF KIDS JUST WANTED TO DO THE BARE MINIMUM WORK AND GET THROUGH THE DAY A FEW OF US REALLY LIKED BOOKS I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD MENTIONED I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT PHILOSOPHY I WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD PRESSED TO FIND ANOTHER TEACHER WILLING TO GO SO FAR OUT OF HIS WAY BUT THIS GUY SPLIT THE CLASS UP INTO SECTIONS BASED ON WHO WAS WILLING TO DO WHAT THE KIDS WHO WANTED TO JUST DO THE BARE MINIMUM GOT WHAT THEY WANTED BUT THEY WERE STILL PUSHED AND ULTIMATELY TOOK MORE THAN THE MINIMUM AWAY FROM THE CLASSICAL THE KIDS WHO WANTED TO READ MORE AND DO LESS WORKBOOK STUFF WERE GIVEN THE OPTION TO WRITE COMPREHENSIVE ESSAYS ABOUT THE BOOKS THEY READ AND THEY WERE LEFT ALONE MOST DAYS TO JUST SIT AND READ FINALLY SINCE I WAS THE ONLY KID WHO HAD ASKED FOR THE WHOLE GODDAMN ENCHILADA I WAS GIVEN TIME A COUPLE OF HOURS A DAY TO STUDY PHILOSOPHY IN WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY A TUTOR APPRENTICE ROLE MY TEACHER STARTED BY HANDING ME AN EARLY EDITION OF A CONCISE INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC BEFORE HE LET IT GO THOUGH HE CHANGED THE REGISTER OF HIS VOICE AND CLEARLY ENUNCIATED THAT THIS WAS A WRECKING BALL HE WAS GIVING ME HE MADE SURE TO POINT OUT THAT FOR A LESS DEVELOPED BRAIN A STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF LOGIC ABSOLUTELY ACTS LIKE A WRECKING BALL IF YOU AREN'T REALLY SKILLED AT AIMING YOUR WRECKING BALL YOU WILL ANNIHILATE ALL THE OTHER SHIT CLOSE TO WHAT YOU WANTED TO KNOCK DOWN THIS IS METAPHORICAL OR COURSE BUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN MY LIFE MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS LOGICAL VASTLY OUTSTRIPPED MY UNDERSTANDING OF EMOTIONS LIKE EMPATHY AND COMPASSION IT TOOK A TOLL ON MY PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS TEACHING A KID TO THINK LOGICALLY IS ONE THING BUT ACTUALLY TEACHING THEM LOGIC IS SETTING THEM UP TO BE COMBATIVE IN FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT IT ISN'T ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO GET PEOPLE TO COME AROUND TO YOUR WAY OF SEEING THINGS BY USING LOGIC AND REASON AND RHETORIC TO PERSUADE THEM AS A KID I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES WHAT IS RIGHT IS LETTING PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE WRONG
NO PLEASE

THE WORLD DOES NOT NEED MORE CHILDREN WHO THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE WORLD AND POST ABOUT IT ON FACEBOOK EVERY MINUTES
THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES COZ BIOLOGICALLY THE HUMAN FRONTAL LOBE ISN'T FULLY DEVELOPED TILL AROUND UNIVERSITY YEARS IMPLICATING POTENTIAL INABILITY TO REASON AT A HIGH PHILOSOPHICAL LEVEL MUCH LIKE YEAR OLDS FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THE VOLUME OF LIQUID DID NOT CHANGE MUCH WHEN POURED INTO A DIFFERENT SIZED CONTAINER BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CAN'T YET SO THEN THEY WOULD USE MORE EMOTIONAL REASONING COZ THE AMYGDALA SURE IS DEVELOPED ALRIGHT AND THE WHOLE CLASS WILL BE AROUSED AND THERE WON'T BE ANY ACADEMIC DISCUSSION LEFT IT MAY BE WORTH TO TEACH THEM PHILOSOPHY CONCEPTS AND LOGIC BTW MY COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY CLASSMATES IN UNI STILL HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH THESE SO I'M NOT EVEN SURE ABOUT THIS POINT BUT THE USUAL PHILOSOPHY COURSES PROB WON'T BE VERY PRODUCTIVE
I UNDERSTAND OPS POINT AND I AGREE WITH IT HOWEVER I FEEL THAT IT IS LESS A QUESTION OF INCORPORATING PHILOSOPHY AND MORE ABOUT LEARNING TO MEASURE KNOWLEDGE BETTER
TEACH A MAN TO FISH VS GIVE A MAN A FISH IN OUR CURRENT TEST TAKING ENVIRONMENT IT IS EASY FOR A PERSON TO CHEAT OR UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO MEASURE HOW WELL A PERSON CAN PROBLEM SOLVE AND THINK THROUGH PROBLEMS LOGICALLY
I'D ARGUE THAT PARAGRAPHS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN TEACH KIDS YOUR SECOND EDIT MAKES MY EYES BURN
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT SCHOOL DOESN'T TEACH YOU THE SKILLS YOU NEED IN LIFE WHICH FOR THE MOST PART THEY ARE CORRECT I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT SCHOOL IS A PLACE TO PREPARE YOU FOR YOUR FUTURE JOB SO YOU CAN BE A GOOD EMPLOYEE OR EMPLOYER A MINDLESS DRONE THAT DOES WHAT IT IS TOLD TO DO AFTER ALL THE ONLY WAY TO GET A A IS TO STUDY EVERY THING THAT THEY TOLD YOU TO STUDY


IF YOU LOOK AT EVERYTHING ABOUT A SCHOOL IT'S MADE YOU TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS WITH OUT QUESTION AND SEE HOW LONG YOU LAST I E THE UNIFORMS TIMING ETC THIS IS NOT THE EXACT QUOTE BUT IT GOES ALONG THE LINE OF SCHOOL IS A STICKABILITY TEST IF YOU CAN SURVIVE THAT YOU'RE FIT FOR YOUR ADULT JOB BGP GREY

JUST HERE TO OFFER A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS
IMAGINE A NATION ARMED WITH CRITICAL THOUGHT INSTEAD OF WILLFUL IGNORANCE
I DISAGREE HAVING EDUCATED YOUTH IS A HUGE THREAT TO SOCIETY JUST IMAGINE IF PEOPLE WERE RAISED TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND IN COMPLEX WAYS THIS WORLD WOULD FALL APART
I DISAGREE WHILE PHILOSOPHY IS A NOVEL SCIENCE IT IS NO WHERE IMPORTANT AS SCIENCE MATH AND ENGLISH WHILE IT DOES TEACH YOU TO QUESTION WHY YOU ARE THINKING WHAT YOU ARE THINKING IT HAS VERY LITTLE REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS WHERE AS MATH AND SCIENCE TEACH YOU HOW TO THING AND ARE FULL OF REAL WORLD APPLICATION
I AGREE BUT THERE ARE POLITICS KEEPING A PHILOSOPHY COURSE OUT OF THE SCHOOLS

THE GOV AND MANY PARENTS WANT K TO BE ABOUT MOULDING STUDENTS WITH A COOKIE CUTTER NOT FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND INDIVIDUALITY
I'M ACTUALLY THE ONLY GIRL ON MY CAMPUS GOING FOR A PHD IN PHILOSOPHY IT'S QUITE ANOTHER THING WHEN OTHER UNDERGRADS IN THE COURSES THINK ALL IT IS IS A CHANCE TO ARGUE ABOUT THE ELECTION
IMAGINE IF PHILOSOPHY WAS TAUGHT AT A YOUNGER AGE WE WOULD HAVE STUDENTS WHO ACTUALLY REALIZED HOW TERRIBLE OF A CANDIDATE TRUMP REALLY IS ADDITIONALLY WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HEAR THINGS LIKE I GENUINELY WITH ALL MY HEART BELIEVE MY 3RD PARTY CANDIDATE HAS A CHANCE OF WINNING

I THINK COURSES LIKE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE IB PROGRAM SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE REGULAR CURRICULUM OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IT SERVES AS A PAVEMENT INTO LOGIC AND REASONING AS STUDENTS GET CLOSER TO BECOMING REGISTERED VOTERS

THIS JUST CAN'T HAPPEN SADLY THERE ARE ALREADY TOO MANY CLASSES IN AN AVERAGE MIDDLE OR HIGH SCHOOL AND I CAN'T THINK OF ONE THAT SHOULD BE REPLACED FOR PHILOSOPHY MAYBE ENGLISH IF THE KEY ELEMENTS ARE TIED INTO THE CLASS
POLITICS WOULD BE GREATLY HELPED BY THIS
WITH INTERNET BEING SUCH A MAJOR PART OF OUR LIVES I WOULDN'T MIND YOUNGLINGS LEARNING HOW TO HAVE A PROPER DISCUSSION WITHOUT REACHING FOR MY MOM
THEY DO BUT ARE TAUGHT I OTHER CLASSES
IN A BETTER WAY LOGIC IN BOTH MATH AND SCIENCE AND ETHICS IN LITERATURE AND LAW IMO THEIR IS NOTHING IN PHILOSOPHY THAT IS NOT TAUGHT IN A BETTER WAY IN OTHER SUBJECTS I DO THINK PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE MANDATORY IN COLLEGE BUT K I BELIEVE SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR REQUIRED SKILLS AND OR SUBJECTS LIKE MATHS SCIENCE AND ENGLISH
I THINK TEACHING DISCRETE MATHEMATICS WOULD BE MORE USEFUL IT WAS THE CLASS THAT TAUGHT ME HOW TO WRITE PROOFS AND EXPLAIN MY REASONING

PHILOSOPHY IS TOO BROAD AND THE TEACHING OF PHILOSOPHY NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE MADE ANY PROGRESS IN MATH COURSES WE READ COMPILATIONS OF GREAT THEORIES NOT A BOOK YEARS OLD
I FEEL LIKE THE AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM IS RATHER OUTDATED AND IS PURPOSELY DESIGNED TO KEEP US THINKING LIKE SHEEP THEY DON'T WANT US TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX
I THINK THE MAIN ISSUE IS THAT PHILOSOPHY IS ANTITHETICAL TO STANDARDIZATION
I FEEL LIKE LOGIC IS TOO DIFFICULT FOR STUDENT OF THAT LEVEL PHILOSOPHY REQUIRES DIFFICULT THINKING OF LOGICAL EVENTS I THINK THAT'S WHY IT IS A CORE CLASS IN COLLEGE BECAUSE STUDENTS DON'T GET AN UNDERSTANDING IN PHILOSOPHY AT YOUNGER AGES THE ISSUE WITH AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IS THAT A LOT ALREADY HAVE DIFFICULTY THINKING ABOUT LITERATURE AND SCIENCE IT HAS TO BE SLOW
IT'S FUNNY YOU KIND OF DISPROVED YOURSELF WITH YOUR OWN ARGUMENT YOUR FIRST ARGUMENT WAS THAT TEACHING PHILOSOPHY WOULD LEAD TO BETTER DISCUSSIONS AND LESS OR AT LEAST BETTER DISAGREEMENT AND WE WOULD ALL COME TO THE RIGHT DECISIONS

THEN YOU GO ON TO SHOW THAT THE ROOT DISAGREEMENTS WE HAVE ARE ALREADY MORAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENTS WE'RE ALREADY AT THAT HIGHER LEVEL OF DISAGREEMENT
I DON'T THINK A PHILOSOPHY COURSE AT A KINDERGARTEN ELEMENTARY JR HIGH OR HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL WILL END UNCIVIL DEBATES AND UNCIVIL DISCUSSIONS EVEN THOSE TRAINED IN PHILOSOPHY AND PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE CAN BE AGENTS AGAINST DEBATE AND DISCUSSION LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN THOUGHT HIMSELF SO ABOVE EVERYONE IN DEBATE THAT HE WOULD JAB PEOPLE WITH A FIRE POKER TO FORCE PEOPLE TO GET TO THE POINT

I WAS TRAINED IN PHILOSOPHY AND WHAT THAT LEAD ME TO DO WAS USE PRECISE LANGUAGE BUT IT ALSO MEANT THAT EVERY POINT NEEDED ELABORATION AND IT TURNED ME INTO A WIND BAG AT SOME POINT WHEN DEALING WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE BOUND TO LOOK FOR A BREAK IN DISCOURSE SO THEY CAN CHALLENGE AT LEAST SOME POINT THAT I'M MAKING RUDENESS IS A NECESSITY THERE

SHOULD PHILOSOPHY BE IN SCHOOL YES IT SHOULD BE DRAPED IN ALL OF OUR LIBERAL ARTS PROGRAMS AND USED AS A GUIDE TO CORRECT OPINION ARTICLES PEOPLE ARE WRITING MOST OF OUR K EDUCATION IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED AROUND LINGUISTIC MECHANISMS BUT NOT MUCH OF ACTUALLY MAKING ANY SENSE OF THINGS
PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS MATH SCIENCE ENGLISH ETC IN SCHOOL THE REASON I BELIEVE THIS IS BECAUSE PHILOSOPHY FORCES YOU TO KNOW WHY YOU THINK SOMETHING

THIS IS WRONG HUMAN COMMUNICATION ISN'T JUST THE WORDS YOU ARE WRITING OR SAYING EVEN WHEN SOMEONE KNOWS WHAT HE IS SAYING IT DOESN'T WORK OUT AS A NECESSARY NICE DEBATE COMMUNICATION IS ABOUT CULTURAL CONTEXT AND INTERESTS TOO


I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT CRITICAL THINKING SHOULD BE TAUGHT AT SCHOOL THERE WEREN'T CLASSES FOR IT AT ANY OF THE SCHOOLS I WENT TO
THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN CRITICAL THINKERS POSE A THREAT TO THE STATUS QUO THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT SCHOOLING IS TO RAISE TAX CATTLE
JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS HAPPENS IN SOME PLACES IN PORTUGAL THERE ARE 2 MANDATORY YEARS OF PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL NO MATTER WHAT BRANCH YOU CHOOSE TO STUDY ECONOMICS HUMANITIES SCIENCES ART THE BEST SUBJECT AND TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD ALTHOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT I GUESS YOU NEED TO BE LUCKY WITH THE TEACHER I THINK ABOUT THOSE CLASSES ALMOST DAILY IMMENSELY
YOU'RE A SOPHOMORE IN HIGHSCHOOL SO YOU JUST NEED TO SUBMIT YOURSELF TO THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT SHIT AND ALL OF YOUR IDEAS ARE TERRIBLE

I JUST GOT OVER THAT WHOLE THINKING I KNEW EVERYTHING AND LOOK I'M STILL DOING IT BECAUSE I'M THINKING MY OPINION IS BETTER THAN YOURS

TRUTH IS NO ONE KNOWS SHIT ABOUT SHIT SO JUST KEEP YOUR MIND OPEN EVERY CLASS IS A PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL
I FEEL LIKE I WOULD HAVE GOT MORE OUT OF PHILOSOPHY CLASSES THAN MOST CLASSES K
MAYBE THEY SHOULD TEACH TO WRITE FIRST THAT WAS PAINFUL TO READ
I HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS AND COULDN'T AGREE MORE
THE DO BUT I THINK LOGIC IS BETTER LEARNT IN SCIENCE AND MATHS AND ETHICS IN LAW AND LITERATURE I DO THINK THAT PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN COLLEGE BUT I BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR REQUIRED CORE SUBJECTS LIKE MATH ENGLISH AND SCIENCE
HAPPY TO SAY THAT MY CATHOLIC THEOLOGY REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN COVERING MORAL PHILOSOPHY AND SUCH VERY WELL I'M SURPRISED BY HOW NEUTRALLY IT'S BEEN TAUGHT GUESS I'M LUCKY
I WOULD AVOID IMPLEMENTING PHILOSOPHY CLASSES AS THEY COULD EASILY DEVOLVE INTO ROTE MEMORIZATION OF NAMES OF PHILOSOPHERS AND THEIR IDEAS PERHAPS A LOGIC CLASS WOULD BE MORE SUITABLE
MATH IS NOT PURELY LOGICAL MUCH OF MODERN MATH IS EMPIRICAL AND A LOT OF USES FOR MATH ARE MORE ART THAN SCIENCE IN ADDITION YOU COULD ARGUE THAT A LOT OF MATHEMATICS IS PRACTICAL UI THE HUMAN MIND AND COMPUTERS ARE GOOD AT SOLVING SOME PROBLEMS A CERTAIN WAY AND NOT SO MUCH OTHER WAYS FOR EXAMPLE NUMBER SYSTEMS ARE HARD TO WORK WITH COMPARED TO POSITIONAL ONES
THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE IS TAUGHT TO IB STUDENTS IT'S PROBABLY THE CLOSEST THING TO A PHILOSOPHY CLASS FOR HIGH SCHOOL ALTHOUGH IT'S LIMITED TO ADVANCED STUDENTS IT WOULD MOST DEFINITELY BE A CHALLENGE TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY TO A GOOD FRACTION OF THE STUDENT BODY EVEN MATH IS TAUGHT AS ROTE MEMORIZATION FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDENTS
IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT UNTIL THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS FIXED
I'VE BEEN TO AMERICA AND IT'S REQUIRED THERE
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU ON THIS
I AGREE IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY REALLY JUST MAKE YOU MEMORIZE IT IS NEVER CRITICAL THINKING BASED THIS IS GREAT IF WE CAN PUSH THIS WE'D ALL BE COMFORTABLE WITH OUR OWN MINDS TO BE ABLE TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND MAKE INFALLIBLE JUSTIFICATIONS WE EXPAND OUR POWERS IN WAYS WE THOUGHT WAS NOT POSSIBLE
YOUR EXAMPLES OF PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE MY ENGLISH CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT EXPLICITLY A CLASS I CERTAINLY WAS TAUGHT IT
AT THOSE LOW LEVELS OF LEARNING PHILOSOPHY CLASS IS CALLED READING
I THINK LIFE SKILLS WOULD BE A BETTER FIT
WE SHOULD HAVE A MARKET IN EDUCATION SO THERE CAN BE THOUGHTFUL EXPERIMENTATION ACROSS THE SPECTRUM
I WOULD DISAGREE A GREAT BOOK TO READ IS THE REPUBLIC THE PURPOSE OF THE BOOK DESCRIBES THE BEST CITY STATE WITH THE BEST KING HOWEVER FOR THIS CITY TO WORK EACH CITIZEN MUST BE THE BEST HE CAN BE ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO PHILOSOPHY YOU NEED TO HAVE A BASE FOUNDATION OF ALL THE OTHER CURRICULUM TO ACTUALLY MAKE SOPHISTICATED AND UNIQUE PHILOSOPHIC OBSERVATIONS ALSO IT GOES OVER HOW WHEN A STUDENTS IS TRAINED HE WILL BE TRAINED FOR X YEARS OF GEOMETRY FOLLOWED BY ASTRONOMY BECAUSE GEOMETRY HAS TO BE KNOWN BEFORE ASTRONOMY THIS IS ALSO APPLIED TO EVERY OTHER CURRICULUM HOWEVER START WITH NUMBERS READING AND WRITING
I WENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN THE US AND PHILOSOPHY WAS PART OF OUR CORE CURRICULUM IN GRADES AGES ROUGHLY
FORMAL LOGIC RATIONALITY CRITICAL THINKING AND SKEPTICISM SHOULD BE TAUGHT IF ALL OF THAT IS INCLUDED IN PHILOSOPHY THEN YES TEACH PHILOSOPHY

ALSO ENGLISH OR ANY NATIVE LANGUAGE SHOULD HAVE MORE FOCUS ON HOW TO CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WITH ANOTHER PERSON
IN THE S I TOOK PHILOSOPHY AS AN ELECTIVE THE TEACHER FOCUSED STRONG ON LOGIC AND ETHICS IT WAS WORTHWHILE MANY WERE FREAKED-OUT BY THE RIGOR OF ACTUALLY STUDYING LOGIC IN A MATHEMATICAL WAY
HERE IS A EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PHILOSOPHY ISN'T EMPHASIZED
I THINK ALL OF THOSE DAMN ILLEGALS NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS COUNTRY
YOU'RE JUST A INTOLERANT BIGOT
AFTER PHILOSOPHY IS EMPHASIZED
I THINK ALL OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS COUNTRY
WHY WHAT NEGATIVE IMPACT DO THEY HAVE
WELL THEY TAKE OUR JOBS
BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH SAYS THEY DON'T
BUT WHAT MAKES THEM ENTITLED TO US CITIZENSHIP


IS CALLED POLITICAL EDUCATION AND MATURITY PHILOSOPHY CAN LEAD TOWARDS THAT GOAL BUT IT CANNOT ACCOMPLISH IT BY FORCING SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING THEY ARE NOT PREPARED TO THINKING

ONLY IF WE INCENTIVIZE THINKING ON YOUR OWN AND STOP PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR HAVING DIFFERENT OPINIONS OF SUPERFICIAL TOPICS WE CAN HAVE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS

ONLY IF YOUR VOICE CAN BE HEARD AND YOU FEEL RESPECTED AND RESPECT OTHERS WHILE NOT RUNNING RISK HURTING SOMEONES FEELINGS THOUGHT SIMPLE SPEECH

WE DONT NEED PHILOSOPHY PER SE WE NEED AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WHICH INTERACTS WITH DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND IS NOT BASED ON THE SOLE IDEA ON LEARNING DATES AND FORMULAS TO COMPUTE THE CORRECT ANSWER BECAUSE AFTER ALL THE LESSON TO LEARN FOR ALL OF US IN LIFE IS THAT IN MANY CASES AND SITUATIONS THERE IS NO CORRECT ANSWER ONLY THE ANSWER WE LIKE OR PREFER AND IF WE ARE NOT PREPARED DEFENDING THIS IDEA WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE VALIDITY OF OTHER OPINIONS WE CANNOT ACHIEVE WHAT YOU WANT

SO INSTEAD OF FORCING PEOPLE TO TAKE COURSES THEY WILL HATE MAKE THEM THINK IN COURSES THEY ALREADY HAVE AND MAKE IT FUN
THE AVID PROGRAM MAY BE WORTH LOOKING INTO

K PHILOSOPHY HAS NO PLACE IN AN EDUCATION SYSTEM STRUGGLING TO PRODUCE STUDENTS WITH BASIC LANGUAGE MATH COMPETENCIES NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU SPLIT IT YOU'D BE TAKING CLASS TIME AWAY FROM OTHER VALUABLE SUBJECTS

PHILOSOPHY AS A HIGH SCHOOL ELECTIVE IS AVAILABLE AT MOST SCHOOLS BUT AGAIN MAKING IT A REQUIREMENT FOR EVERYONE WOULD BE TAKING CLASS TIME AWAY FROM STUDENTS WHO NEED TO BUILD BASIC SKILLS

AS A FINAL NOTE WHILE YOU PICK ON TRUMP AS MUCH AS THE MEDIA AND THE CLINTONS LIKE TO PORTRAY HIS AVERAGE SUPPORTER AS AN UNEDUCATED REDNECK HILLBILLY OR AS PART OF A BASKET OF DEPLORABLE TRUMP ALSO WINS THE COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE VOTE MOST OF WHOM HAVE STUDIED PHILOSOPHY DURING THEIR UNDERGRADUATE BY A HEALTHY MARGIN

YOU'RE RIGHT THAT PARTISAN DISCOURSE DIES IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF AD HOMINEM AND NAME CALLING BUT YOU'RE ALSO GUILTY OF FALLING INTO THAT TRAP BY DECIDING THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS MUST BE UNEDUCATED RACIST OR BOTH

EVEN FOR THE UNEDUCATED SUPPORTERS YOU MAY NOT CARE FOR THE LOGIC OF A OUT OF WORK SINCE THE CLINTONS SIGNED THE NAFTA WHICH SHIPPED HIS MANUFACTURING JOB OVERSEAS SO THAT THE COMPANY COULD BE MORE PROFITABLE BUT IT EXISTS TRY EXPANDING YOUR MIND TO CONSIDER HIS SET OF PRIORITIES AND SOME OF HIS LOGIC SHOULD START COMING TOGETHER
RECENTLY THERE WAS A PUSH IN MY COUNTRY CHILE TO REMOVE PHILOSOPHY AS A SUBJECT I'M ON MOBILE SO I'M GONNA ADD THE LINK LATER WE'RE LIVING IN TIMES WHERE WE NEED THE SKILL TO LOOK EVENTS FROM SEVERAL ANGLES AND TO DISCUSS THEM IN MEANINGFUL WAYS SO WE CAN GET SOLUTIONS

WHY WE WOULD GET RID OF IT THEN BECAUSE PHILOSOPHY ISN'T PHILOSOPHY

TO CONDENSE SUCH A HEAVY SUBJECT ONTO AN ALREADY CROWDED SYSTEM YOU NEED LASER SHARP FOCUS ON WHAT YOU NEED AND WHAT YOU WANT TO GET FROM THE COURSE IT'S BEEN PROVEN AT LEAST HERE I'M PROOF OF IT THAT TEACHERS DON'T GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT IT

THE PROBLEM ISN'T GETTING PHILOSOPHY IN IS GETTING PEOPLE CAPABLE OF TEACHING IT AND ENGAGE STUDENTS INTO ACTUALLY LEARNING FROM IT THE SUBJECT IS PRETTY DENSE AND DULL YOU NEED A LOT OF EFFORT PUT INTO IT TO MAKE IT WORK AND THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN SOCIETY NOWADAYS OVERVALUES MATHS AND SCIENCES BECAUSE THEY'RE EASIER TO TEACH AND THOSE SKILLS ARE NEEDED ON THE WORK MARKET

PEOPLE UNDERVALUE PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A MARKET VALUE RATHER IT HAS A HUMAN VALUE IT MAKES US BETTER PEOPLE IN A SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT'S COMPLETELY FAR FROM TEACHING KIDS TO BE BETTER PEOPLE INSTEAD OF CHOKING THEM WITH INFORMATION PHILOSOPHY ISN'T GONNA WORK

UNLESS YOU OVERHAUL THE SYSTEM AND CHANGE THE FOCUS ON TEACHING SKILLS FOR LIFE INSTEAD OF SKILLS FOR WORK SOMETHING SIMILAR THAN WHAT HAPPENED HERE WILL HAPPEN

MY PHILOSOPHY CLASSES WERE SEPARATED IN TWO PSYCHOLOGY AND ACTUAL PHILOSOPHY THE FIRST SECTION WAS BASICALLY PSYCHOLOGY TERMINOLOGY THROWN OUT WITHOUT ANY PURPOSE BEHIND IT THE OTHER SECTION WAS AN OVERALL LOOK AT SOME PHILOSOPHY THINGS LIKE SOCRATES OR THE CAVERN MYTHOLOGY MY TEACHER TRIED TO ENGAGE US BUT TO NO AVAIL THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF WHAT IT MEANT OR WHAT IMPLICATION HAS NOWADAYS NOTHING

IT WAS 2 CLASSROOM HOURS A WEEK WASTED IN NOTHING MOST OF WHAT I LEARNED OF PHILOSOPHY I LEARNED IT OUTSIDE SCHOOL MOSTLY THROUGH VIDEOS FROM THE SCHOOL OF LIFE IN YOUTUBE

OVERALL THE QUESTION ISN'T WHY IT ISN'T A SUBJECT YET IT'S RATHER HOW WE MAKE IT WORK IF THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS A MESS
HAD I TAKEN PHILOSOPHY COURSES IN HIGH SCHOOL I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE NEVER GONE INTO THE MAJOR I CHOSE AT THE OUTSET IN UNIVERSITY I MINORED IN PHILOSOPHY AFTER BEING RANDOMLY ASSIGNED A COURSE AS A GEN ED AT MY SCHOOL AND AFTER YEARS OF COURSES GETTING A TASTE OF A VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES IN THE FIELD I DEVELOPED NOT ONLY SIGNIFICANT DOUBTS ABOUT MY PRIMARY FIELD OF STUDY BUT ALSO A SIGNIFICANT REEVALUATION OF THE VALUES THAT MADE ME WANT TO GO INTO MY FIELD IN THE FIRST PLACE I'M GRATEFUL THAT THESE STUDIES KEPT ME FROM DEVELOPING REGRET DOWN THE ROAD WHEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO LATE TO CHANGE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OF MY LIFE BEEN WASTED
IF I HAD READ MARCUS AURELIUS MEDITATIONS WHEN I WAS AND NOT THE OUTCOME OF THAT ENTIRE DECADE BEEN DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE TAUGHT FROM WHEN CHILDREN ARE KNEE-HIGH TO A GRASSHOPPER
I'M A RECENT UNDERGRAD GRADUATE WHO DOUBLE MAJORED IN IR AND PHILOSOPHY I COMPLETELY AGREE

EVEN IF WE WEREN'T TEACHING KIDS PHILOSOPHICAL DOCTRINES TEACHING THEM LOGIC AND THE SOCRATIC METHOD WOULD HELP EVERY SUBJECT IMO MATH LOGIC HISTORY MORE WILLING TO CHALLENGE THE NORM AND QUESTION THINGS INSTEAD OF JUST ACKNOWLEDGING THAT XYZ ARE THE WAY THINGS ARE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN


IN IB THERE'S THIS NECESSARY CLASS CALLED THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE THAT'S SUPPOSEDLY A COMBINATION OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THAT PART OF THE PROGRAM YET DON'T KNOW IF I'LL LAST TILL THEN
SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WOULD BE MORE A CLASS ON ONTOLOGY AND ETYMOLOGY SO KIDS WOULD LEARN HOW WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT IS

EDIT WRONG OLOGY
I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE HOMESCHOOLED AND MY MOTHER INCLUDED SEMESTERS OF LOGIC IN MY CURRICULUM WE ALSO ANALYZED A FEW PHILOSOPHY TEXT BUT ONLY REALLY PLATO AND ARISTOTLE FROM WHAT I RECALL
TSH I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING FROM SCHOOL BESIDES ARITHMETIC AND SOME HISTORY
NO IT SHOULDN'T
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH MY SCHOOL DOES THIS SORT OF I GO TO AN IB SCHOOL AND IN GRADES WE HAVE TO TAKE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH A PHILOSOPHY BASED CLASSICAL SO FAR IT'S TURNED OUT PRETTY WELL
I THINK SYMBOLIC LOGIC SHOULD BE MANDATORY ALONG WITH SOME WESTERN PHILOSOPHY THOSE CLASSES IN MY EARLY COLLEGE YEARS WERE EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN HELPING ME FIND A CAREER PATH PROGRAMMING AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO WRITE WITH NO FILLERS
IN MY SCHOOL WE COULD NOT CHOOSE CLASSES PHILOSOPHY AND ETHICS WAS A MANDATORY CLASSICAL
YEA WELL YOU'RE A NERD
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT K BUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FOND OF THE IDEA OF TEACHING PHILOSOPHY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY AT A YOUNG AGE PHILOSOPHY DID SO MUCH FOR ME WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I WAS READING NORSE PHILOSOPHY EASTERN PHILOSOPHY AS WELL AS SOME NIETZSCHE AND BRUCE LEE MUCH OF IT WAS LOST ON ME BUT IT GAVE ME IDEAS AND MENTORS THAT STUCK WITH ME FOR A DECADE IF NOT LONGER TO TODAY EVENING IT HELPED ME BE A WEIRD YOUTH WHO STOOD UP AGAINST BULLIES ON BEHALF AS WELL AS RATHER DEPRESSED HAHA I BELIEVE ONE QUOTE I REMEMBER FROM NORSE MYTHOLOGY WAS TO BE WISE IS SYNONYMOUS TO BEING DEPRESSED FOR WISDOM IS A BURDEN NOT PROCLAIMING I AM WISE OR EVER HAVE BEEN BUT IT STILL MADE SENSE TO ME AND WAS IMPORTANT EVEN SO I APPRECIATE HAVING LEARNED SOME PHILOSOPHY AT A YOUNG AGE AND WOULDN'T CHANGE IT

OF COURSE I DIDN'T LEARN LOGIC UNTIL I MAJORED IN PHILOSOPHY WHEN I HIT THE UNIVERSITY THAT BEEN HELPFUL TOO HAHA
LOGIC SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN COLLEGE ALL STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE A GOOD PROPÆDIA
I AGREE NOT SURE ABOUT CURRICULUM IN YOUR COUNTRY I THINK THAT SUCH TOPICS SHOULD BE INCLUDED FROM PUBLIC SCHOOL LEVEL IF THEY AREN'T ALREADY IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO BE ABLE TO FORMULATE STATEMENTS CLEARLY AND TO CONSIDER THE REASONS BEHIND OPINIONS AND ARGUMENTS
DOESN'T ENGLISH CLASS OR EQUIVALENT CONTAIN SOME SORT OF ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ARGUMENTATION IN SPEECHES AND TEXTS
THIS MAY BE USEFUL
TOO MUCH TIME IS SPENT ON QUIZ ANSWERS SO TEACHERS CAN GRADE

PHILOSOPHY TAUGHT RIGHT FOCUSES ON THE THINKING PROCESS AND FORMULATING BETTER QUESTIONS AND BELIEFS BECAUSE CAN WE EVER REALLY KNOW

WITHOUT PHILOSOPHY ONE CAN'T TRULY BE EDUCATED CAN THEY WITH PHILOSOPHY WE WON'T BE AS SMUG
PHILOSOPHY WAS ONE OF MY EASIEST COURSES IN COLLEGE I WOULDNT MIND THAT EXTRA A GROWING UP
NO I CAN'T BELEAVE YOU ME TO SUFFER LIKE THAT
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES WHY WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THIS FROM THE BEGINNING IS MIND BOGGLING
IT SORT OF IS FOR IB STUDENTS IT'S CALLED OK
JUST TEACH BASIC LAW THE PRACTICAL BENEFITS ARE MUCH HIGHER EVERY PERSON SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN SMALL CIVIL MATTERS MORTGAGE TRAFFIC COURT ETC
PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE AS IMPORTANT AS MATH
BOD NOTHING SHOULD BE AS IMPORTANT AS MATH
THIS POST IS A JOKE RIGHT
WHILE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOUR IDEA I DON'T THINK IT'S ADVISABLE TO BE TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT ABSTRACT AND INTANGIBLE CONCEPTS AS EARLY AS KINDERGARTEN THERE IS A REASON WE DON'T TEACH THE CONCEPT OF ZERO UNTIL LATER IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND WHY EARLY MATH IS ALWAYS EXEMPLIFIED WITH PHYSICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF NUMBERS CHILDREN TEND TO THINK VERY LITERALLY AND THEIR LOGIC IS CONCRETE THIS IS THE REASON WHY I DON'T APPROVE OF CHILDREN BEING TAUGHT SEX ED BEFORE THE AVERAGE AGE OF PUBERTY OR ABOUT A LOT OF THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES THAT I SEE TEACHERS TRYING TO PUSH ON YOUNGER STUDENTS FIRST DAY INFORMATION FORMS ASKING 5TH GRADERS WHAT THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS IS AN EXAMPLE I'VE SEEN SEVERAL TIMES CHILDREN ARE IMPRESSIONABLE AND A LOT OF THE TIME THEY DON'T REALLY LEARN SO MUCH AS PARROT INFORMATION GIVEN TO THEM THE ABILITY TO QUESTION THINGS YOU ARE BEING TAUGHT YOU WHEN SOMEONE IS ONLY AROUND IS RATHER PRECOCIOUS AND SHOULD NOT BE EXPECTED OF MOST CHILDREN OF THAT AGE NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE'D WANT IT TO BE AND TRYING TO FORCE THE IDEAS OF CRITICAL THINKING TO EARLY CAN OFTEN LEAD TO REBELLIOUS BEHAVIOR DUE TO CONCRETE AND LITERAL THINKING

I'M NOT SAYING THAT THESE THINGS SHOULDN'T BE TAUGHT I'M JUST SAYING THAT IT SHOULD WAIT FOR AROUND JUNIOR HIGH LEVEL AROUND GRADE WHEN THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN'S CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS WILL BE GROWN ENOUGH TO START BEING ABLE TO GRASP THESE CONCEPTS EVEN THEN I STILL HAVE MY DOUBTS HOW MUCH OF HUMAN NATURE CAN REALLY BE TAUGHT ANYWAYS THE WAY I SEE IT IT'S LIKE TALKING ABOUT SEX TO SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT YET OR CANNOT EXPERIENCE IT THEY PROBABLY UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BUT THEY CAN NEVER AT THIS TIME REALLY FEEL AND PERSONALIZE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING I THINK PHILOSOPHY IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THROUGH YOUR OWN LIFE AND YOUR CONNECTION TO THE HUMAN CONDITION TO LEARN AND THAT YOU WILL NEVER TRULY APPRECIATE IT IF YOUR FIRST REAL EXPERIENCE WITH IT IS IN A STERILE CLASSROOM
I TOTALLY AGREE PHILOSOPHY IS A PART OF EVERY SLICE OF LIFE YET PEOPLE AVOID IT OR MOCK IT
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT SUBJECTS WHILE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR LOGIC AND PHILOSOPHY ARE STILL DIFFERENT SUBJECTS I HAVE TAKEN A LOGIC CLASS AND I HAVE TAKEN A PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL IN MY CAREER I USE LOGIC FAR MORE I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TEACH A LOGIC COURSE AND INTEGRATE PHILOSOPHY INTO THE STEM CLASSES HAD PROFESSORS THAT JUST WANTED ME TO REGURGITATE INFORMATION I ALSO HAD PROFESSORS THAT GENUINELY WANTED ME TO LEARN AND THINK FOR MYSELF THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN ADDING A PHILOSOPHY CLASS TO K
YOU'VE HAD PLENTY OF COMMENTS BUT I WANTED TO ADD JUST ONE I DATED A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER FOR SEVERAL YEARS

YOU'RE JUST A INTOLERANT BIGOT
AFTER PHILOSOPHY IS EMPHASIZED
I THINK ALL OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS COUNTRY
WHY WHAT NEGATIVE IMPACT DO THEY HAVE
WELL THEY TAKE OUR JOBS
BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH SAYS THEY DON'T
BUT WHAT MAKES THEM ENTITLED TO US CITIZENSHIP
AND BACK AND FORTH INSTEAD OF NAME CALLING ACTUAL LOGICAL DISCUSSION

THIS IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO HAVE PARENTS COMPLAIN AND GET THAT SHIT SHUT DOWN THE PROBLEM WITH THESE CLASSES OR ANY POLITICAL THEORY TYPE COURSE FOR KIDS THAT AGE IS THAT PARENTS WILL SEE IT AS THEIR LESSONS BEING UNDERMINED

EVEN FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE I ONCE TRIED TO WRITE AN OBJECTIVE PIECE ABOUT THE CONFEDERATE FLAG I ATTENDED SCHOOL IN MISSISSIPPI AND I WAS THE EDITOR OF THE NEWSPAPER I MEANT NO HARM ABOUT IT BUT I WANTED AN UNBIASED LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE FLAG THAT WAS SUCH A HOT TOPIC

WHEN PEOPLE CAUGHT WIND OF IT WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTIONS THE PRINCIPAL RECEIVED CALLS I WAS BROUGHT IN AND TOLD I WOULD NOT BE WRITING IT OR I'D BE OFF THE NEWSPAPER PERMANENTLY

THESE COURSES ARE A GOOD IDEA IN THEORY BUT PARENTS ARE THE WORST
AT MY HIGH SCHOOL WE DID A UNIT ON PHILOSOPHY SENIOR YEAR IN ENGLISH CLASSICAL BEING AN ALREADY LOGICALLY THINKING PERSON I EXCELLED PAST ALL MY CLASSMATES WHO FOUND IT TERRIBLY BORING
IT REALLY WOULD HELP LINK TOGETHER WRITING IN SCIENCE HISTORY MATH WITH THE KIND YOU DO IN ENGLISH SO OFTEN GROWING UP YOU WOULD HEAR A TEACHER COMPLAIN ABOUT THE OTHER SUBJECTS TEACHING WRITING IMPROPERLY WHEN THEY'RE REALLY ALL MISSING FUNDAMENTALS THAT WOULD LINK THEM TOGETHER
DOES ANYONE HAVE SUGGESTIONS FOR INTRODUCING PHILOSOPHY INTO AN ENGLISH CLASSROOM I'LL BE A TEACHER FOR TH GRADE CLASSES NEXT YEAR AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT OFTEN BUT DON'T KNOW REALLY WHERE TO START
THIS IS A VERY THOUGHTFUL POST AND IS THE REASON I LOVE REDDIN

COMING FROM A MATH BACKGROUND HONESTLY SPEAKING MANY THINGS ARE TAUGHT WITHOUT GIVING THE REASON FOR EXAMPLE 2 2 MANY KIDS ARE FORCED TO MEMORIZE THAT ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE JUSTIFIED BY COUNTING
PHILOSOPHY DOES NOT MEAN YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHY BECAUSE OF LOGICAL THINKING SUBJECTIVITY VS OBJECTIVITY IS MUCH MORE RELEVANT IN PERCEPTION THAN LOGIC LOGIC IS DISPLAYED MUCH MORE IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS THAN PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHY THE STUDY OF THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF A PARTICULAR BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERIENCE
OK WELL I GUESS WE CAN AGREE TO
DISAGREE I THINK YOUR PLACING FAR TO MUCH VALUE IN PHILOSOPHY
TO BEGIN WITH AWESOME OP I LOVE THE CONCEPT OF INTRODUCING PHILOSOPHY TO STUDENTS AT A MUCH YOUNGER AGE I DO NOT THINK YOU ARE ARGUING FOR THIS THOUGH I BELIEVE YOU ARE ARGUING THAT PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO CRITICALLY THINK AND MAKE A SOUND ARGUMENT I AM A 3RD YEAR PHILO MAJOR AND I DON'T SEE ANY RELATION TO PHILOSOPHY IN YOUR PROPOSAL ASIDE FROM LOGIC AND ARGUMENTS LOGIC IS THE FOUNDATION FOR MAKING A SOUND ARGUMENT BUT IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS ALL OF PHILOSOPHY I DON'T SEE HOW INTRODUCING HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY CONTEMPORARY ETHICS OR EVEN METAPHYSICS WOULD REALLY BENEFIT SOMEONE IN HIGH SCHOOL ON THE CONTRARY CRITICAL THINKING AND LOGIC CLASSES WOULD DO AN AMAZING AMOUNT TO OPEN PEOPLE'S MINDS IT IS SICKENING TO THINK THAT SOUND ARGUMENTS REALLY ONLY WORK ON PHILOSOPHERS
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M LATE TO THE PARTY BUT STILL DO CHECK THE SEP

PHILOSOPHY FOR CHILDREN
I HOPE YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT EXAMPLE CONVERSATION ENDS IS WITH THE PERSON ARGUING AGAINST IMMIGRATION SAYING THAT ALL THE INFORMATION PRESENTED TO COUNTER HIS ARGUMENT IS LEFTIST INFORMATION CREATED BY THE LIBERAL MEDIA TO TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY OR SOMETHING LOGIC ONLY GOES SO FAR BUT WHEN PEOPLE REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO

ALSO I DO AGREE WITH OTHERS THAT OTHER FIELDS CAN TEACH LOGICAL THINKING AS WELL I HAVE MY BACHELORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND I THINK THAT FIELD TAUGHT ME MORE ABOUT HOW TO QUESTION THINGS AND THINK LOGICALLY THAN ANY PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION CLASS I EVER TOOK IN MY UNDERGRAD OR HIGH SCHOOL CAREER

STILL I SEE THE VALUE AND THE LONG-TERM BENEFITS AND I AGREE MORE LOGICAL THINKING SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO KIDS AT A YOUNG AGE
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT IN THE ORIGINAL POST THE FACT IS THAT THE JUSTIFICATION FOR HAVING MATHS AS A COMPULSION TILL FURTHER EDUCATION IS THAT THE STUDY OF MATHEMATICS DEVELOPS LOGICAL THOUGHT PROCESSES MATHEMATICS TEACHES STUDENTS TO THINK LATERALLY AND TO SOLVE PROBLEMS USING THE TOOLS THEY HAVE AVAILABLE MY ISSUE IS THAT MATHEMATICS IS CLEARLY FOCUSED ON THE STEM FIELDS AND ISN'T AS IMPORTANT FOR THE HUMANITIES BASED SUBJECTS IS PHILOSOPHY DEVELOPS THE SAME THOUGHT PROCESSES AS MATHS WHY CANT IT BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR STUDENTS WHO WISH TO PURSUE FIELDS THAT DON'T REQUIRE MATHS

I AM SUPPORTING THE TEACHING OF PHILOSOPHY THROUGHOUT SCHOOL NOT JUST IN SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION
I HAD A COURSE CALLED LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING IN H SOUTH

IT WAS BY FAR THE BEST CLASS I'VE HAD UP TO THAT POINT AND MAYBE EVER

GOT EXPOSED TO CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHY IN JUNIOR COLLEGE BUT IT WAS MORE MEMORIZATION OF DEAD PPL THAN ANYTHING ELSE
SERIOUS QUESTION

SINCE ITS UNLIKELY THAT THE AMERICAN EDUCATION SYSTEM WILL IMPLEMENT THIS FOR MY KIDS HOW CAN I TEACH MY KIDS PHILOSOPHY AT HOME WHILE THEY'RE IN K ANY RECOMMENDED READING OR VIDEOS
WE HAD COMPULSORY RHETORIC CLASSES IN GRADES IN A RUSSIAN PUBLIC SCHOOL O IT WAS GREAT AS IT INTRODUCED ME TO MANY PHILOSOPHERS AND SOME WAYS OF THINKING
I DON'T THINK THE US IS CAPABLE OF MAKING A PHILOSOPHY CURRICULUM WITHOUT IT BEING EXTREMELY EXTREMELY BIASED PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY KIDS ONLY REALIZE THAT PEOPLE CAN THINK DIFFERENT WHEN THEY'RE AT THE EARLIEST AND DON'T REALLY DEVELOP ANY SORT OF MEANINGFUL INTROSPECTION TILL MUCH LATER

AS A HIGH SCHOOL CLASS I DEFINITELY THINK KIDS SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO SOME FORM OF PHILOSOPHY BUT I DON'T THINK MOST ARE MATURE ENOUGH TO APPLY IT REASONABLY IN THEIR LIVES POSSIBLY IT WOULD BECOME A DETRIMENT TO THEM IF THEY REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I THINK CHOOSING WHERE TO START WOULD BE REALLY REALLY HARD CAN'T JUST THROW SOME HIGHSCHOOL FRESHMEN INTO MILLS AND EXPECT THEM TO GET IT
I BELIEVE TO MAKE THIS AUTHOR'S POST MORE CONCISE WOULD BE TO SAY THAT THE AUTHOR WANTS MORE LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING TAUGHT IN GRADES K PHILOSOPHY IS A BROAD CONCEPT AND IT IS TRUE THAT PHILOSOPHY CAN BE AN UMBRELLA TERM FOR HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH REQUIRES NO CRITICAL THINKING BUT AT THE CORE OF THE ACTUAL DISCIPLINE OF PHILOSOPHY IS LOGIC

I ATTRIBUTE THE LOGIC OF PHILOSOPHY OF HOW MATHEMATICS IS TO PHYSICS MATH IS THE LOGICAL CONSTRUCT OF SYMBOLS THAT DEFINE THE FORCES IN NATURE TO PREDICT AND EXPLAIN REAL WORLD PHENOMENA AND SO TOO IS RHETORIC FOR PHILOSOPHY MEANING WORDS AND LANGUAGE ARE IS USED INSTEAD OF ARBITRARY SYMBOLS

ESSENTIALLY I AGREE BECAUSE IF WE WERE ALL TRAINED IN PHILOSOPHY CLEARLY WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS MISUNDERSTOOD ARGUMENT OF CONFLATING PHILOSOPHY WITH HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE A TRAINED PHILOSOPHER WOULD FIRST ASK TO
DEFINE PHILOSOPHY

ALSO A MINOR CRITICISM OF PHILOSOPHICAL IDOLS SAM HARRIS IS NOT REALLY A PHILOSOPHY GENIUS HE IS A MODERN REGURGITATION THAT HAS PACKAGED OLD SIMPLISTIC IDEAS INTO SEXY WELL UNDERSTOOD SENTENCES DECIPHERABLE ENOUGH FOR THE AVERAGE BRAIN TO UNDERSTAND A POINT I COMMONLY HEAR ABOUT SAM HARRIS IS THAT HE IS SO GREAT AND SMART FOR BEING A NEUROSCIENTIST CHALLENGING ISLAM AND THE EXISTENCE OF GOD BUT THERE ARE REALLY MUCH MUCH BETTER AND MORE SOPHISTICATED DEVOTED SCHOLARS WHO HAVE FLESHED OUT HARRIS ARGUMENTS IN FULL AND REFUTED THEM KANT DAVID HUME SIMONE WEIL HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL OF HIS ARGUMENTS BEYOND HIS SCOPE
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S NOT PHILOSOPHY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOUNDS LIKE LOGIC AND BASIC SPEECH CLASSES I HAD TO TAKE IN HIGH SCHOOL I RAISE YOU THIS HOWEVER I BELIEVE IF MORE PEOPLE GREW SOME SPINE AND LEARNED THAT EVERYBODY JUDGES YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO AND SUCK IT UP WE'D HAVE MORE INTELLIGENT CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING AND LOGIC WOULD BE PURSUED IN THE MEANS OF DEFENDING ONESELF JUST MY THOUGHTS
I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM OF INDIVIDUALS BEGINNING TO LACK CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS AND THE ABILITY TO ARGUE EFFECTIVELY IS BECAUSE STUDENTS AREN'T TAKING PHILOSOPHY I'M PERSONALLY OF THE BELIEF THAT IT'S PURELY THE FAULT OF THE CURRENT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND ITS HEAVY FOCUS ON MEMORIZATION

I REMEMBER STRONGLY WHEN GOING THROUGH MATH THAT KIDS JUST ONLY REALLY MEMORIZED A FORMULA FOR HOW TO SOLVE SOMETHING AND JUST USED IT FOR EVERY PROBLEM ON A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT AND THEN MEMORIZED IT FOR THE TESTAMENT THEN WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A QUESTION THAT REQUIRED KIDS TO THINK A LITTLE BIT OUT SIDE THE BOX APPEARED ON THE TEST KIDS LOST THEIR S WHEN GETTING BACK THE QUIZ KIDS COMPARED SCORES ON THE TRICK QUESTION AND WHISPER TO EACH OTHER FURIOUSLY THAT THE TEACHER NEVER COVERED THE MATERIAL IN CLASSICAL BUT I DIGRESS

I'M A VERY STRONG BELIEVER THAT THE MAIN PROBLEM ISN'T JUST KIDS LACKING THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO THINK CRITICALLY IT'S JUST THAT AREN'T ASKED TO AND SO THEY WON'T DO IT


WAY TO BRING YOUR WRONG VIEWS ON POLITICS INTO IT
AS SOMEONE WHO STUDIED PHILOSOPHY FOR PER WEEK ALONG WITH MATHS OF GEOPOLITICS AND OF LANGUAGES DURING 2 INTENSIVE YEARS IN THE FRENCH PREPARATORY CLASSES I AGREE
I LOVE HOW IT TEACHES YOU TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING AND THINK LOGICALLY
OUR EXAMS WERE SUPER INTERESTING BASICALLY ONE SENTENCE THEN YOU'D HAVE TO WRITE AN PAGES ESSAY TWILIGHT OF TRUTH IS ONE I DEARLY REMEMBER
PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO DEBATE EVEN IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS THEY SHOULD KNOW HOW TO LISTEN TO AN OPPOSING VIEW AND THEN FORMULATE THEIR OWN WITHOUT DEVIATING WILDLY FROM THE ARGUMENT AND ATTACKING AN OPPONENT

THIS AND WE NEED ACTUAL FORUMS OF DEBATE THE INTERNET IS NICE FOR CONVERSATIONS BUT THREADED COMMENTS AND NO REALTIME MODERATION MAKES FOR POOR DEBATING THAT FIZZLES OUT AFTER BEING BELITTLED THROUGH DOWNVOTING OR THROUGH PERSONAL ATTACKS

ANYONE WHO CANNOT CARRY ON A DEBATE WITHOUT RESORTING TO PERSONAL ATTACKS CANNOT BE TREATED AS A RATIONAL PARTICIPANT

ALSO A FRUITFUL DEBATE CAN ONLY HAPPEN IF ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE EQUALLY INFORMED ON A SUBJECT WHICH IS RARELY THE CASE WITH MEDIA BIAS AS WELL EVERYONE WILL HAVE AN OPINION BUT RARELY ANY KNOWLEDGE TO BACK IT UP

PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN TO INFORM THEMSELVES AND THIS INCLUDES KNOWING HOW TO DEBATE DEBATE SHOULD BE ABOUT BOTH LEARNING AND ARGUING A POINT BUT PEOPLE RARELY HAVE THE INTROSPECTION NECESSARY TO BE ADAPTABLE IN A CONVERSATION AND WILL SIMPLY CONTINUE PARROTING POLITICAL RHETORIC OR USING QUOTES WITHOUT CONSIDERING AN OPPOSING VIEW

I PERSONALLY FIND IT HIGHLY FRUSTRATING
IT'S A HEAVY SUBJECT YOU'D NEED TO WATER IT DOWN NOT SAYING GRADE SCHOOL KIDS ARE DUMB JUST SAYING MAKING IT A CONSECUTIVE MANDATORY SUBJECT WOULD BE A BIT TRICKY

I'D MAKE THE ANALOGY THAT IT'S LIKE TRYING TO MOVE AN AP HISTORY COURSE DOWN TO THE EARLY GRADE LEVELS SURE IT'S POSSIBLE BUT WHY
SQUASH ALL BEEF
PHILOSOPHY HAS MANY TENETS SOME ARE DEEMED UNNECESSARY TO BE INDUCTED BUT SOME I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LOGICAL FALLACIES FOR INSTANCE

HERE IN OUR COUNTRY PEOPLE BEGIN TO USE ARGUMENTS REALLY BAD FALLACY EVERYWHERE REFLECTED FROM THE OBNOXIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA DUE TO LACK OF EDUCATION ABOUT THE SUBJECT IF LOGICAL FALLACIES IS TAUGHT WELL AT LEAST ON THE GRADE PART WHICH SEEMS APPROPRIATE FOR A YEAR OLD STUDENT I SHALL FIND THE FUTURE GENERATIONS MORE OUTSPOKEN TO THEIR OWN VIEWS THAN OF WHAT I SEE ON OUR COUNTRY TODAY

IN MY EXPERIENCE I'M CURRENTLY ENROLLED ON A COLLEGE BUT I HAD LEARNED HOW TO ARGUE LOGICALLY AND TO DISCERN WHAT FALLACIES ARE JUST RIGHT I BEGIN TO RESEARCH THE INTERNET MYSELF
I HAVE THIS BELIEF THAT PHILOSOPHY GIVES US A BREATHER BEFORE WE REACT SUDDENLY

THIS MAY JUST BE THE SAVING GRACE OF HUMANITY AT THE JUNCTURE OF DOOM
TOOK AN ETHICS CLASS IN COLLEGE THERE WERE VERY FEW OF US WHO WERE INTERESTED IN IT ENOUGH TO DO THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF REQUIRED READING DON'T THINK A CLASS LIKE THIS WOULD GO OVER TOO WELL WITH KIDS I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL BUT DON'T REALLY THINK REQUIRING IT IN WOULD BE TOO HELPFUL MAYBE AS AN ELECTIVE OR SOMETHING
GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS WILL NEVER TEACH A CLASS THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT THE FOUNDATIONS OF GOVERNMENT AND TO QUESTION THE NECESSITY OF AUTHORITIES THERE IS ALSO AN ARGUMENT THAT YOUNG MINDS AREN'T YET EQUIPPED TO UNDERSTAND THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS BEING PROPOSED IN MOST PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS

PERHAPS AN AP PHILOSOPHY COURSE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SOME ADVANCED STUDENTS BUT FOR MOST STUDENTS THE CLASS COULD BE SEEN AS CORRUPTING THE YOUTH JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO SOCRATES
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU BUT THE SAD TRUTH IS EDUCATION SYSTEMS AREN'T REALLY DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU AN INDEPENDENT THINKER OR A GOOD HUMAN THINK ABOUT WHAT LEVELS OF PERSONAL GROWTH YOU COULD REACH WITH TWELVE TWELVE YEARS OF EDUCATION WE'RE JUST TAUGHT TO SWALLOW INFORMATION AND REGURGITATE

THIS IS A REAL FRUSTRATION OF MINE AND IT WAS THE ONLY SUBJECT I COULD PASSIONATELY WRITE ESSAYS ABOUT BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL


EDIT THE WAY I WOULD STIMULATE THAT MINDSET IS NOT VIA BOOKS BUT VIA CONVERSATION ONE ON ONE OR IN GROUP KIDS ALREADY ARE NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS WHEN THEY'RE IN THAT PHASE WHERE THEY ASK WHY AFTER EVERY ANSWER YOU GIVE

THERE IS A PHILOSOPHY CLASS I TOOK IN COLLEGE CALLED CRITICAL THINKING AND I THINK IT WOULD FIT WELL SOMEWHERE IN HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM IT WAS BASICALLY JUST ABOUT LOGICAL STRUCTURES FOR ARGUMENTS VALIDITY AND SOUNDNESS AND COMMON ERRORS IN REASONING THAT'S DOABLE BUT THE IDEA OF TEACHING NIETZSCHE OR ETHICS OR METAPHYSICS OR ANYTHING SPECIALIZED IS NOT REALISTIC
IN MY SCHOOL GERMANY PHILOSOPHY IS WHAT YOU CAN TAKE IF YOU DON'T TAKE CATHOLIC PROTESTANT RELIGION GRADES I MEAN YOU MOSTLY LEARN ABOUT RELIGIONS IN THE FIRST YEARS BUT ALL IN ALL THE CRITICAL THINKING AND THAT WE ALWAYS COLLECTED PERSONAL OPINIONS WAS GREAT SOME PEOPLE FROM RELIGION EVEN SWITCHED WHAT YOU CAN CHOOSE EVERY YEAR UNTIL SE II I'M JUST KIND OF DISAPPOINTED THAT IN THE SE II WE WILL ONLY DISCUSS KANT
I THINK KINDERGARTEN THROUGH FIFTH GRADE IS AN ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TIME FOR PHILOSOPHY EXPOSURE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE STUDENTS HAVE THE FOCUS REQUIRED FOR HARD SPECIFICS LIKE COMPUTATIONAL TASKS OR MEMORIZATION TO GET BIG PAYOFFS IN STUDENT OUTCOMES

OF COURSE IT IS APPROPRIATE LATER BUT I FEEL LIKE WE INTRODUCE PHILOSOPHY AS ITS OWN FIELD WAY TOO LATE FOR IT TO WORK BEST WHY DON'T WE ACTUALLY DOES ANYONE KNOW I'M SURE I'M OVERLOOKING DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF KIDS AND SUBSTITUTING FACTS FOR WHAT I FEEL IS RIGHT ANYONE WORK IN EDUCATION
IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS IN THE INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE PROGRAM WE HAD A REQUIRED CLASS CALLED THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I'VE EVER TAKEN
I STILL REMEMBER WHEN I WAS DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE MY I B EXTENDED ESSAY ON PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL BECAUSE I HAD NO OFFICIAL EDUCATION IN THE SUBJECT THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE NOT HAVING ENOUGH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE IN A SUBJECT AREA PRIOR COULD BE A DEATH TRAP WHEN YOU ARE STUCK WRITING ON SAID SUBJECT UNTIL YOU CONSIDER THAT I WAS NEVER GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO OFFICIALLY LEARN IT

IT SUCKS EVEN MORE BECAUSE I AM AN AMATEUR PHILOSOPHER OF SORTS HAVING PONDERED LOGIC ETHICS ETC OFTEN THROUGHOUT MY HIGH SCHOOL CAREER IF ONLY THEY KNEW THAT I KNEW MORE IN THAT AREA THAN THE AVERAGE U SOUTH HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT I AM FROM THE U SOUTH FYI

ON A SIDE NOTE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE CLASS WAS A REQUIREMENT FOR I B DIPLOMA STUDENTS SADLY B DIPLOMA STUDENTS WERE RESTRICTED FROM TAKING IT AND WAS A SORT OF CLASSICAL UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF MY FELLOW I B STUDENTS YES EVEN THE GENERALLY OVERACHIEVING I B STUDENTS REGARDED IT AS MORE OR LESS OF A CLASSICAL
THE LOGICAL FORMULA OF THINKING YES THERE IS ONE

WHAT DOES IT PURPORT TO DO
I BEG TO DIFFER PUBLIC EDUCATION IS THERE SO WE CAN BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS PHILOSOPHY HARDLY ACTUALLY DOES MUCH FOR SOCIETY AT LEAST NOWADAYS IT'S PERFECTLY FINE IF IT'S AN ELECTIVE THOUGH MY HIGH SCHOOL HAD ONE FOR SENIORS
PHILOSOPHY IS TAUGHT IN SINGAPORE AS AN EXAMINABLE SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE AND INQUIRY WHICH CAN BE USED FOR APPLICATION TO UNIVERSITIES I TOOK THE SUBJECT AND I REALLY LOVED IT BECAUSE IT FORCED ME TO QUESTION THE EPISTEMIC BASIS OF ALL THAT I KNEW AND REALLY RELOOK THE WORLD AROUND ME HOWEVER IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH A SYLLABUS IS ROCKY FOR THE MOST PART ONLY THE TOP INSTITUTIONS IN MY COUNTRY OFFER THIS SUBJECT DEMARCATION OF THE SYLLABUS IS PRETTY DARN BROAD LEAVING SCHOOLS TO INTERPRET WHAT MIGHT BE EXAMINED AND AWEING TO THE PERCEIVED DIFFICULTY OF THE SUBJECT ENTRANCE TESTS ARE ADMINISTERED JUST FOR THE SUBJECT ALONE AND CANDIDATURE IS PUNY JUST STUDENTS OUT OF A COHORT OF STUDENTS IN MY SCHOOL THAT BEING SAID IT DOES HAVE ITS MERITS THERE'S A WIDE EXPOSURE TO PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS AND STUDENTS ARE GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO DEEPEN THEIR KNOWLEDGE THROUGH APPLYING THE CONCEPTS THEY'VE LEARN TO ANY TOPIC BY WRITING A WORD PAPER INDEPENDENTLY FROM MY EXPERIENCE OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM PREPARES STUDENTS SUFFICIENTLY AND PHILOSOPHY IS A NICE ADD ON BUT NOT ENTIRELY NECESSARY AS AN ACADEMIC PURSUIT OP SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT PLENTY OF OTHER SUBJECTS CAN TEACH THE LOGIC HE DEEMS TO BE SO LACKING IN HIS COUNTRY WHICH A GOOD GRASP OF CURRENT AFFAIRS WOULD CERTAINLY HELP THE SKILLS I'VE LEARNT ARE CERTAINLY HELPFUL BUT THEY REALLY NOT DISSIMILAR TO OTHER SUBJECTS THAT REQUIRE REASONING IMPLICITLY OR EXPLICITLY FOR EXAMPLE IN HISTORY WE'RE TAUGHT TO CONSTRUCT COGENT ARGUMENTS WITH WELL SUPPORTED EVIDENCE 2 OFTEN PEOPLE ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR OWN EMOTIONAL ARGUMENTS AND REJECT PHILOSOPHY AS TOO ANALYTICAL AN ALTERNATIVE SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE DISDAIN FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DUE TO THEIR ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCES AND NO AMOUNT OF PHILOSOPHY CAN RELIEVE SUCH PERSONAL CONVICTIONS
YES PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE TAUGHT BUT IT SEEMS THAT YOU ARE PINING FOR STUDENTS TO BE TAUGHT CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS YES

BUT HISTORY SHOULD BE NOT JUST TAUGHT MORE BUT IT SHOULD BE ALSO THE CORE OF THE CURRICULUM FROM TH GRADES
I AGREE GROWING UP IN NEW YORK CITY I FEEL AS IF THE MOST VALUABLE LESSONS I HAVE EVER LEARNED WERE OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO DISCUSS THESE LESSONS THEY WEREN'T TOPICS OF CONVERSATION THAT COULD BE BROUGHT INTO A CLASSROOM FOR BEING

IT IS A CATCH BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT THINGS THAT ARE MEANT TO INFLUENCE THEIR THINKING WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING TAUGHT HOW TO THINK IF I WERE TO GO BACK IN TIME AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN I WISH THAT I COULD HAVE LEARNED THE BRAIN IN A VAT THEORY AT A VERY YOUNG AGE IT OPENED MY MIND UP TO THE WORLD OF THEORIES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT HELPED ME REALIZE THAT EVERY PERSON HAS THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE AND INFLUENCE BEHIND WHY THEY BELIEVE SO
UNTIL OUR SOCIETY NO LONGER NEEDS MINDLESS WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY HUMANS WE NEED CONFORMISTS TO BE FARMED AND SHAPED TO BECOME COGS IN THE MACHINE THAT IS MODERN INDUSTRY AS AUTOMATION SPREADS IN ALL AREAS PERHAPS THE TIME FOR AN EXAMINED YOUTH WOULD BE WORTHWHILE
SCHOOLING IS THE ULTIMATE FORM OF VETTING WHY WOULD A SCHOOL IN ANY WAY WANT TO CREATE INDIVIDUALLY POWERFUL CAPABLE PEOPLE WITH INCLINATION TO INACT QUESTION EVERYTHING WITH HONEST INTENTION THE BEST SCHOOLED BECOMES THE COUNTRY LEADER IN OTHER WORDS THE HIGHEST VETTED YOU STAND OUT FROM THE CROWD AND YOU ARE BULLIED YOU ACHIEVE MORE THAN EXPECTED THEN YOU ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME MORE WITH AN INEVITABLE MOMENT OF FAILURE ON THE HORIZON

THE MERE CONCEPT OF A VALUABLE ADDITION TO SCHOOLING WOULD BE ECOTONAL AND REALISTIC CLASSES BASED ON TEAM BUILDING AND PERSONAL EXPRESSION THE VALUE OF HONESTY THE MEANING OF LOYALTIES THE FOUNDATION OF INTEGRITY

PHILOSOPHY ITSELF IS JUST ANOTHER CLASS THAT GIVES THOSE WHO YEARN A CLASS FOR ASKING THE QUESTIONS OTHERS MIGHT NOT A PLACE TO DO JUST THAT

SEGREGATION ONCE AGAIN WHILST ENCOURAGING THOSE WITH DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS TO ALIGN THEMSELVES WITHIN A CONTAINER OF RESTRAINT ULTIMATELY OF COURSE WITH THE LITERATURE AND WORKINGS VETTED BY THE GOVERNMENTS AND CONTROLLERS OF THE RESPECTIVE DOMAIN

RATIONALITY IN ITSELF IS NOT ENOUGH AS RATIONALE IS SPECULATIVE AND INDEPENDENT THOUGHT IS PROVOCATIVE

ALL THE WHILE PEOPLE FIGHT AMONG THEIR OWN DECLASSIFICATION AND FOCUS ON SUCH IDIOCIES AS RACISM PREJUDICE CREED AND CLASSICAL SCIENCE ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH JUST AS FAITH ISNT TOO

WHAT IS REQUIRED A PURGE OF INTELLECTUAL NEGLECT
PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS SPIT OUT LABOUR FORCE ROBOTS YOU WANT A RUDIMENTARY EDUCATION THAT ENABLES WORKERS TO FOLLOW ORDERS REASONING CREATIVE THINKING AND SUCH ARE NOT THE PRIMARY CONCERN OF HIGH SCHOOLS

THIS IS WHY I'M GOING TO DO MY BEST TO SEND MY FUTURE CHILDREN TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS EVERYONE HATES THESE PREPPY POMPOUS KIDS BUT IF THEY OFFER BETTER EDUCATION I'M SOLD
WHAT ABOUT NO PHILOSOPHY IS BORING AS SHIT AND LARGELY POINTLESS NOW PHILOSOPHY WAS EXTREMELY USEFUL WHEN THE SCIENTIST WAS THE PHILOSOPHER UNFORTUNATELY NOW WE HAVE TALKING HEADS WHO ARGUE SUCH ABSTRACT AND UNIMPORTANT POSITIONS AS ARE THE AXIOMS OF MATHEMATICS FALSE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HOLD UP IN BASE
IT IS IN MY COUNTRY ROMANIA TAUGHT IN GRADE SENIOR
IN OUR CLASS WE HAVE SOMETHING CALLED UNDERSTANDING CULTURE SOCIETY AND POLITICS WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH IS PHILOSOPHY IN A WAY WE'RE THE FIRST K BATCH IN GRADE IN THE PHILIPPINES
AGREED KIDS NEED TO BE TAUGHT REASONING SKILLS OUTSIDE OF HOW TO WRITE A PAPER FOR ENGLISH CLASSICAL I'M ALSO A PROPONENT OF REQUIRED COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES BUT THOSE WOULD BE INCOHERENT WITHOUT INSTRUCTION IN LOGIC AS WELL
WESTERN EDUCATION IS NEEDED TO CREATE DUMBED DOWN INDIVIDUALS PROFESSIONAL CONSUMERS YOU NEED SOMEONE WHO'S BEING CAPABLE OF PICKING BETWEEN TWO OFFERS OF PERSONAL LOANS BUT NOT ACTUALLY THINK THROUGH WHY DO THEY NEED THE LOAN IN THE FIRST PLACE
PRIMARY FUNCTION IS TO TRAIN NOT TEACH
I WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL AND DESPITE POPULAR BELIEF WE ALWAYS LEARNED ABOUT SEVERAL DIFFERENT RELIGIONS IN RELIGION CLASS WHICH SERVED MUCH THE SAME PURPOSE AS A PHILOSOPHY CLASSICAL IT HELPED ME OPEN MY MIND AND MAKE MY OWN CHOICES
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO INDOCTRINATE CHILDREN IF THEY ARE FIRST TAUGHT TO ASK WHY NEVER GONNA HAPPEN
TAKING PHILOSOPHY IN COLLEGE CHANGED MY LIFE I TOOK A REASONINGS COURSE BECAUSE IT WAS AN EASY ALTERNATIVE TO A MATH CREDIT I'M AWFUL AT MATH PARTLY BECAUSE I'M HORRIFICALLY DYSLEXIC WITH NUMBERS AND PARTLY BECAUSE DISLIKE IT AFTER TAKING THE CLASS I FOUND MYSELF TAKING EVERY PHILOSOPHY COURSE JUST FOR FUN WHAT AMAZED ME MOST WAS SEEING HOW TERRIBLE MY OPINIONS ON SUBJECTS WERE GROWING UP IN A VERY RELIGIOUS AND CONSERVATIVE FAMILY IT WAS POLARIZING TO SEE HOW FALLACIOUS MY ARGUMENTS FOR SOME OF MY VIEWS WERE

AFTER FINISHING ALL THE PHILOSOPHY COURSES I COULD TAKE I THINK I'M NOW MORE FUNDAMENTAL IN HOW I PERCEIVE THE WORLD AND I'M ABLE TO BREAK DOWN IDEAS AND CONCEPTS TO GET THE REAL MEANING AND UNDERSTANDING WHICH THEN ALLOW ME TO BETTER CONCEPTUALIZE EFFECTS I CAN ALSO TEAR APART FLAWS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S ARGUMENTS OR SEE HOW SOMEONE MIGHT TRY AND MISGUIDE ME CASE IN POINT DESTROYING DONALD IDEAS FOR AMERICA THE GUY IS A WALKING BOOK OF FALLACIES IF I DIDN'T TAKE THOSE COURSES I'D PROBABLY BE IN LOVE WITH HIM
THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT HINGES ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT SCHOOLS ARE MEANT TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THINKING SKILLS ONCE YOU REALIZE THIS ISN'T REALLY THE CASE THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT FALLS APART

SHOULD STUDENTS BE TAUGHT TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT WELL EVERYTHING YES DOES THE STATE WANT A CITIZENRY THAT'S CAPABLE OF CRITICAL THINKING ABSOLUTELY NOT CRITICAL THINKING IS A DIRECT THREAT TO STATE SECURITY
WHAT ABOUT REPLACING ENGLISH CLASSES OR WHATEVER THE LOCAL EQUIVALENT IS WITH COMMUNICATION AND THOUGHT FOR K

THE CURRICULUM WOULD START IN THE EARLY GRADES JUST AS LANGUAGE CLASSES DO NOW WITH READING AND WRITING SPELLING AND GRAMMAR AND OVER TIME STUDENTS WOULD BE INTRODUCED TO ESSAY-WRITING AND ARGUMENT AS WELL AS CLASSICAL AND CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE

IN THE HIGHER GRADES THERE WOULD BE MORE PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACT CONTENT EG LOGIC PERENNIAL TOPICS IN PHILOSOPHY ETC

A LOT OF PHILOSOPHY DEPENDS ON USING LANGUAGE CLEARLY AND PRECISELY AND LEARNING TO THINK CLEARLY AND ARGUE CLEARLY IMPROVES LANGUAGE SKILLS SO TO ME THE CONNECTION SEEMS OBVIOUS
HIGHER QUALITY AND MORE FREQUENT PHYSICAL EDUCATION WOULD BE A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN THIS YIELDING A HIGHER RETURN ON INVESTMENT AS FAR AS LONG TERM QUALITY OF LIFE AND SOCIETAL COSTS I HAD IT ONCE A WEEK FOR AN HOUR FROM K IF THAT BUT IT SHOULD BE A DAILY THING
ABSOLUTELY NOT MUSIC SHOULD BE A CORE K CLASS HOME EC SHOULD BE A CORE K CLASS ART AUTO SHOP AND PE SHOULD BE REQUIRED IN HIGH SCHOOL PRIMARY SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL ARE ABOUT GIVING YOUNG PEOPLE REAL SKILLS FOR LIFE

PHILOSOPHY IS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE STANDING IN A CIRCLE TALKING ABOUT HOW THINGS SHOULD BE BUT DOING NOTHING
PS PHILOSOPHY CLASS IS NOT LOGIC CLASS YOU LEARN LOGICAL EXAMINATION AND THOUGHT FROM MANY SOURCES ESPECIALLY THE SCIENCES
PHILOSOPHY WAS ACTUALLY RANKED AS ONE OF THE LEAST DESIRABLE DEGREES BY EMPLOYERS I THINK PHILOSOPHY MAJORS TEND TO OVER ESTIMATE ITS IMPORTANCE YOU CAN LEARN LOGIC IN OTHER FIELDS AS WELL
OP I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE NONCHALANTLY BUTCHER THE TERM LOGIC SO SEVERELY BEFORE FROM YOUR LAUGHABLY LAY USAGE OF SOUND LOGIC ILLOGICAL VALID AND SO ON I DARESAY YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALLY TAKEN A COURSE ON FORMAL LOGIC YOUR ENTIRE POST WAS A HODGEPODGE OF BULLSHIT YOUR VAGUE UNDERSTANDING OF LOGIC BEYOND STUFF THAT MAKES SENSE AND FALLACIES MAKES AN ABSOLUTE MOCKERY OF WHAT LOGIC ACTUALLY IS

UNFORTUNATELY YOU HAVEN'T DEFINED LOGIC VERY WELL IN YOUR POST AS A RESULT YOUR POST HAS LITTLE TO NO ACTIONABLE CONTENTION IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN YOU ARE USING THE TERM LOGIC YOU ARE REFERRING TO INFORMAL LOGIC WHICH IS THE STUDY OF EVERYDAY ARGUMENTS WITHOUT USING FORMAL RULES OR ANY SORT OF ORGANIZED SYSTEM TYPICALLY THESE EVERYDAY ARGUMENTS WILL BE EVALUATED IN A CRITICAL THINKING OR BABY LOGIC COURSE UNFORTUNATELY SAID EVERYDAY ARGUMENTS ARE OFTEN UNREALISTIC AND TOO LINEAR WHICH WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SKEW THE UNINFORMED STUDENT'S JUDGEMENT OF WHAT AN EVERYDAY ARGUMENT IS AND WOULD CONSEQUENTLY HINDER THEIR ABILITY TO EVALUATE ARGUMENTS IN REAL LIFE WHICH ARE A FAR CRY FROM THE SOCRATES IS MORTAL NONSENSE I SEE IN MOST INTRODUCTORY LOGIC COURSES

ON THE OTHER HAND FORMAL LOGIC WHICH IS WHAT MOST LOGICIANS ARE REFERRING TO WHEN THEY SAY LOGIC IN A NUTSHELL IS THE STUDY OF REASONING AND VALID AND INVALID INFERENCES TYPICALLY THIS WILL INVOLVE STUDYING AN OBJECT LANGUAGE SUCH AS PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC IN OTHER WORDS FORMAL LOGIC IS THE STUDY OF WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T CONCLUDE WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY FROM A SET OF PREMISES OR KNOWN INFORMATION AND THE STEPS YOU MUST TAKE TO GET TO THAT CONCLUSION OR IN THE CASE OF INVALIDITY WHY AND WHEN YOU CANNOT INFER A CERTAIN CONCLUSION FROM A SET OF PREMISES

ANYONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO A COURSE IN FORMAL LOGIC AND METALOGIC THE LOGIC OF LOGIC OR THE THEORY BEHIND DIFFERENT OBJECT LANGUAGES BOTH OF WHICH ARE HIGHLY MATHEMATICAL SUBJECTS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NUANCES OF EVERYDAY ARGUMENTS AS WELL AS THE SCOPE OF DEDUCTIVE LOGIC I FEEL LIKE THIS POST FROM R LOGIC ELABORATES ON MY POINT QUITE CLEARLY



THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS PLEASE EDUCATE YOURSELF ON YOUR TOPIC OF INTEREST BEFORE YOU START THROWING AROUND TECHNICAL TERMS LIKE VALID SOUND AND LOGIC YOU RISK MISLEADING ANY PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS OF PHILOSOPHY BY LACKING UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS LOGIC LOGIC IS A SUBSET OF EPISTEMOLOGY AND EPISTEMOLOGY IS A SUBSET OF PHILOSOPHY YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHEN YOU REFER TO THESE TERMS

YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE GUILTY OF DOING THIS BUT I AM JUST APPALLED BY THE FACT THAT THIS GARBAGE MADE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE OF REDDIN


THE FACT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE FEEL QUALIFIED TO COMMENT ON THIS WITHOUT EVER TAKING A PHILOSOPHY CLASS BECAUSE THEY LEARNED LOGIC FROM THEIR STEM AND SOCIAL SCIENCE CLASSES JUST PROVES THAT PHILOSOPHY DOES NEED TO BE A CORE K CLASS LIKE IT WAS SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS AGO

APPARENTLY ADEQUATE LOGIC AND CRITICAL THINKING ARE TAUGHT IN NEARLY EVERY COLLEGE CLASSICAL AND OUR COUNTRY SEEMS TO GET MORE BARASHIT INSANE EVERY DECADE

THE DOWNFALL OF EDUCATION BEGAN WHEN PHILOSOPHY WAS REMOVED FROM THE CORE CURRICULUM





IT WAS MANDATORY IN MY HIGH SCHOOL

ALL I REMEMBER FROM THAT CLASS WAS MY PROFESSOR DR MILTON SAYING YEARS FROM NOW YOU'LL THINK ABOUT THIS AND REMEMBER THIS CLASSICAL

AND WELL HE'S NOT WRONG

BUT I STILL DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY I DON'T THINK IT'S RELEVANT AFTER GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE SEMESTER IT REINFORCED IN TO ME THAT I SIMPLY DON'T CARE

EVERYTHING CAN BE A CIRCULAR ARGUMENT AND TO ME THE WAY TO AVOID THE CIRCULAR ARGUMENT IS TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THE CIRCLE AND NOT CARE ABOUT THE ARGUMENT AT ALL

AND AS SUCH I SIMPLY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE FREE WILL VS PREDETERMINATION

OH THE ONE THING I DID LIKE ABOUT THE CLASS WAS I THINK THEREFORE I AM THOUGH AND KANT WAS MOSTLY A GOOD GUY
I TOOK A PHILOSOPHY COURSE IN COLLEGE

IT HAS LITTLE TO NO APPLICABLE PRACTICAL VALUE MAKING IT MANDATORY IN HIGH SCHOOL WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY

IF YOU ENJOY EXISTENTIAL DEBATES AND WHATNOT MORE POWER TO YOU BUT THERE IS A REASON PEOPLE LAUGH AT PHILOSOPHY DEGREES THEY DON'T PREPARE YOU IN ANY WAY FOR THE WORKING WORLD
BUT KIDS WOULD HATE IT MORE THAN ENGLISH TALKING ABOUT FEELS AND MESSAGES AND SHIT THAT SOUNDS WORSE THAN POETRY AND IT'S A CLASS YOU COULD FAIL
SO I AM A SOPHOMORE IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO WROTE THE OP TO BRING UP A INTERESTING IDEA THAT I WOULD NEVER PRETEND IS PERFECT IF THIS WERE TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN SO MANY KINKS AND THINGS WOULD NEED TO BE FIGURED OUT AND OUR CULTURE WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE US FOR THIS TO EVER BE A REALITY I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A PRETTY COOL DISCUSSION HERE AND MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN WHEN I FIRST POSTED IT BECAUSE OF THE DISCUSSION I DID NOT POST THIS TO PREACH ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE EVERYONE IS I POSTED JUST TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS REALLY

I DO REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR SOCIETY COULD IMPROVE WITH MORE EMPHASIS ON UNDERSTANDING PERSPECTIVES AND HAVING A MORE LOGICAL PERHAPS RATIONAL THINKING PROCESS ON IDEAS AND OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS WHEN I SAID WE NEED MORE LOGIC I MEANT IN REGARDS TO DISCUSSING AND PERCEIVING IDEAS I'M NOT SAYING EVERYONE IS ILLOGICAL ABOUT EVERYTHING BECAUSE IF THAT WERE THE CASE THERE WOULD BE NO REDDIN FOR ME TO POST ON OR A PHONE FOR ME TO TYPE ON CLEARLY WE HAVE OUR FAIR DOSE OF LOGIC ALL AROUND

HOWEVER LOGIC REGARDING IDEAS IS DIFFERENT THAN LOGIC REGARDING MOST OTHER THINGS BECAUSE WITH IDEAS EMOTION AND BIAS ARE THROWN IN I WOULD NOT WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD WITH NO EMOTION AND IT'S SOMETHING HUMANS WILL HAVE FOREVER WELL UNLESS ROBOTS OR SOME SHIT HOWEVER I THINK MANY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ARE ALLOWING THEIR USUALLY WELL INTENTIONED PRIDE AND EMOTION TO CLOUD THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE A PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION WITH PEOPLE THAT THINK DIFFERENTLY I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND TO NOT HAVE ALLOWED EMOTION AND PRIDE TO CLOUD MY JUDGEMENT SOMETIMES OF COURSE IT HAS

BUT I JUST FEEL THAT IF THE WAY OF THINKING AND ANALYZING IDEAS IN PHILOSOPHY WAS MORE VALUED IN OUR CULTURE WE WOULD BE MORE UNITED AND PRODUCTIVE OF COURSE WE CANNOT GET RID OF EMOTION IN OUR THINKING WE NEVER SHOULD BUT WE CAN BECOME A SOCIETY THAT IS MORE CRITICAL THINKING AND PRODUCTIVE WHEN DISCUSSING IDEAS THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T CLEARLY I DON'T MEAN THIS WILL HAPPEN IN A YEAR BUT THERE IS NO REASON THAT WE CAN'T STRIVE TO EVENTUALLY IMPROVE MORE AND MORE WHEN TALKING ABOUT IDEAS

AS I SAID IN THE OP MANY IDEAS ARE GOING TO BE ROOTED IN MORALITY THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE ILLOGICAL IT'S BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MANY IDEAS JUST ARE LOGIC DOESN'T DICTATE ALL IDEAS IF I SAID THAT ALL HUMANS HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE HUMAN DAMMIT THERE IS NO LOGIC TO THAT BUT IT'S NOT ILLOGICAL EITHER IT'S JUST A IDEA MY MORALS LEAD ME TO SO OFTEN WE THINK PEOPLE'S IDEAS ARE RIDICULOUS AND JUST ATTACK THEM WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT WHY THEY MIGHT HAVE THAT IDEA WHICH ONLY SERVES TO HURT BOTH WAYS OF COURSE SOME IDEAS ARE PREDOMINANTLY BASED IN LOGIC AND AT THAT POINT YEAH SOME IDEAS MAKE MORE SENSE THAN OTHERS BUT EVEN THEN IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY HAVE A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON IT BEING A CUNT ISN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING NOT MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THEIR MIND EXPANDED BECAUSE THEY GOT CALLED A NAME AND MOCKED

I ALSO IMAGINE A SOCIETY WHERE EVERYONE COULD NAME A REASON FOR THEIR OPINION NOT ONLY DO SO MANY PEOPLE NOT QUESTION EVERYTHING SO MANY PEOPLE QUESTION NOTHING SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE STRONG CONVICTIONS ABOUT THINGS BUT CAN'T NAME ANY ACTUAL REASON FOR IT AND THIS DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN WITH SOCIALLY ADWARD ADULTS ON REDDIN LOL

IF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON OUR ABILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY THINK AND ANALYZE THINGS WE WOULD BE BETTER OFFICIAL THIS IS NOT TO SAY WE SHOULD SCRAP THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND START FROM SCRATCH BUT WE SHOULD MAKE MORE OF A EFFORT TO ENCOURAGE CRITICAL THINKING

BASED ON SOME RESPONSES ON HERE I CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU THINK MY IDEA ISN'T ACTUALLY A PHILOSOPHY CLASS BUT JUST BORROWS ELEMENTS OF PHILOSOPHY TO ENCOURAGE INTELLECTUAL THINKING I ALSO REALIZE THE CLASS WOULD HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT THAN MANY PHILOSOPHY CLASSES YOU CAN TAKE AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF EDUCATION RIGHT NOW AND PERHAPS THIS WOULDN'T START UNTIL TH GRADE ONCE PEOPLE ARE MORE MATURE I STILL THINK WE COULD FIND A WAY TO ENCOURAGE PHILOSOPHICAL TYPE THINKING AT THE BEGINNING GRADES BUT CLEARLY TO A DIFFERENT DEGREE THAN THE HIGHER ONES


NO NEVER PHILOSOPHY HAS NO PLACE IN SCHOOL IT'S NOT LOGIC IT'S ABSTRACT
THAT'S WHY THERE'S CRITICAL THINKING AND CITIZENSHIP SUBJECTS

ABD YOU WROTE ALL THAT
DELETED
FOUND THIS ON ALL NO IT SHOULDN'T LOL I MEAN I TOOK ONE IN GRADE AND WHILE IT WAS INTERESTING IT'S NOT REALLY IMPORTANT STUFF JUST AN EASY BIRD COURSE
PHILOSOPHY IS THE PRECURSOR TO SCIENCE JUST AS RELIGION WAS THE PRECURSOR TO PHILOSOPHY MUCH OF WHAT CONSTITUTES PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED BY THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF SCIENCE I WOULD SAY TEACHING SCIENCE MORE RIGOROUSLY WOULD ACHIEVE MORE A GOOD PHILOSOPHY COURSE THESE DAYS WILL JUST HAVE TO KEEP REFERRING TO SCIENCE ANYWAY JUST CUT OUT THE MIDDLE MANUAL

PHILOSOPHY STILL HAS A PLACE IN DISCUSSING MORALS ETHICS VALUE SYSTEMS ETC BUT THE DEBATE AND DISCUSSION OF FACTS AND THE PHYSICAL WORLD SHOULD BE LEFT TO SCIENCE
HIGHSCHOOL PARTIES WOULD BECOME SO SMUG
CRITICAL THINKING NOT PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE IN YOUR EXAMPLE IS NOT PHILOSOPHY IT'S CRITICAL THINKING TO BE MORE SPECIFIC PHILOSOPHY IS TOO BROAD TO INCLUDE FOR KIDS AT THESE AGES AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO REMOVE SOMETHING THAT PHILOSOPHY WOULD REPLACE IT'S NOT AS EASY AS JUST ADDING IT TO THE CURRICULUM

YOU DON'T NEED TO STUDY PHILOSOPHY TO LEARN HOW TO THINKING CRITICALLY IT'S THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR FLUID INTELLIGENCE AND YOU NEED TO SIMPLY WORK IT THROUGH CONSTANTLY BEING SKEPTICAL OF YOUR OWN THOUGHT PROCESS AND BE AWARE OF YOUR OWN BIASES AS WELL AS OTHERS
THERE'S A REASON WHY IT'S NOT ALL OF THESE GOVERNMENT INDOCTRINATION CENTERS WOULD NEVER TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO THINK BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD NOTICE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO THEM AND WAKE UP
RATHER THAN TEACHING PHILOSOPHY PERHAPS WE SHOULD JUST TEACH CRITICAL THINKING THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF THE FORMER ABOUT BUT NOT MUCH OF THE LATTER NOTE THE 2 AREN'T SYNONYMOUS
PHILOSOPHY ITSELF IS A FALLACY AND WHILE TEACHING IT EARLY WILL IMPROVE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS IT WILL ALSO DISTILL THEORETICAL INFORMATION IN THE MINDS OF YOUTH AS IF IT IS FACT THAT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LEAD TO MANY MISCONCEPTIONS LEAD TO MORE CONFUSION THAN ANSWERS
I DISAGREE PHILOSOPHY WAS INTERESTING BUT HARDLY USEFUL SPEECH AND DEBATE SHOULD BE A CORE K CLASSICAL
AGREED AS LONG AS YOU CONCEDE THAT ALMOST ALL OF PHILOSOPHY IS A MISLEADING AND CONFUSED DISASTER COMING FROM A THEISTIC TRADITION

DON'T TEACH THEM DESCARTES TEACH THEM FROM SAY RUSSELL FORWARD
I COMPLETELY DISAGREE UNLESS YOU JUST TEACH PEOPLE THE CORE IDEAS OF PHILOSOPHY LIKE HOW TO QUESTION THINGS DEEPER AND EXPLORE MEANING AND WHAT NOT THE IDEA OF TEACHING PEOPLE X PHILOSOPHER OR Y PHILOSOPHER IS A TOUGH THING TO SORT OUT AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH OF A POINT TO THAT
I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS A GRADUATE STUDENT FOR YEARS I TAUGHT COLLEGE STUDENTS AS A TEACHING ASSISTANT THE US DOES NOT NEED MORE FLUFF TEACHING LIKE PHILOSOPHY AS A MAINSTREAM SUBJECT IT IS PERFECTLY FINE AS A ONE COURSE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL DEGREES I RESPECT PHILOSOPHY AS A SUBJECT AND UNDERSTAND THE VALUE IT BRINGS TO SOCIETY

THE US NEEDS KIDS TO LEARN MATH SCIENCE AND ENGLISH MAYBE THEN YOU'LL NEVER ENCOUNTER THE SITUATION I DID TEACHING COMPUTER SCIENCE I WAS TEACHING THEM JAVASCRIPT AND TOLD THEM WE WOULD SPEND ONE HALF OF A CLASS TALKING ABOUT BASIC MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS IN JAVASCRIPT ONE HALF OF ONE LECTURE A GIRL IN THE BACK GOES MATH DID HE JUST SAY MATH I TOOK THIS CLASS TO GET OUT OF TAKING MATH I WAS GOING TO TEACH THEM HOW TO MAKE THE COMPUTER DO A B FOR THEM ON A WEBPAGE AND SOMEONE FREAKED OUT

NEXT WE HAVE SCIENCE ONE OF MY FRIENDS WAS A TEACHING ASSISTANT FOR CIVIL ENGINEERING HE WAS ALSO FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY HE HAD COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW ROCKS WERE FORMED THEY STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND THAT ROCKS CAN BE IMPERVIOUS OR NOT

FINALLY LET US TALK A LITTLE ABOUT ENGLISH JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO CONVERSE IN ENGLISH DOES NOT MEAN THEY UNDERSTAND WORDS THEY READ READING IS IMPORTANT TO PERSONAL INTELLECTUAL GROWTH THIS IS WHY NEWS OUTLETS AND SHAM WEBSITES ARE HAVING A FIELD DAY FEEDING US MISINFORMATION AND THRIVING ON OUR DESIRE FOR SENSATIONALISM NOBODY WANTS TO READ STUDYING ENGLISH WOULD FORCE A CULTURE OF READING BOOKS

RANT
I FIRMLY DISAGREE PHILOSOPHY IS A CONCEPT THAT IS STRICTLY OPINION YES HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A LOGIC THAT WE'VE APPLIED TO IT GENERALLY BUT THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T TRACK FOR EVERYONE PHILOSOPHY IS NOT A SCIENCE AND SHOULDN'T BE PART OF A MANDATORY EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS YOU MIGHT BE THINKING THAT WRITING OR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AREN'T SCIENCES EITHER BUT THE POINT IS WITH THESE CLASSES YOU HAVE A DEFINITE CERTAIN ANSWER TO ANY QUESTION REGARDING THEM IN PHYSICS A BALL DROPPED WITH THE EXACT SAME CONDITIONS WILL ALWAYS FALL THE SAME WAY AND IN ENGLISH A WORD HAS A CORRECT SPELLING WELL SOMETIMES 2 LOOKING AT YOU GREY GRAY
PHILOSOPHY IS A STUDY THAT IS BASED ON ENTIRELY DEBATABLE FACTS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU REALLY WANT IS AN EMPATHY CLASSICAL TO TEACH PEOPLE TO CONSIDER OTHERS POSITIONS AND BACKGROUNDS ALONGSIDE THEIR ARGUMENT BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS PHILOSOPHY
BITCH I AINT GETTING PAID TO ASK UNANSWERABLE QUESTIONS EVER
CERTAINLY AINT GETTING MY DICK SUCKED FOR ASKING STUPID QUESTIONS EITHER
GET A REAL JOB LOSERS
I WISH THEY WOULD REPLACE ONE OF THE ENGLISH CLASSES WITH THIS
I WISH I HAD PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL EVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CRITICAL THINKING IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF LIFE AND BEING ABLE TO EMPHASIZE YOUR VIEWS WILL SERVE ONE WELL IN LIFE ALWAYS ASK WHY NOT YES SIR ONLY MATH IS A UNIVERSAL TRUTH EVERYTHING ELSE IS UP FOR DISCUSSION AND LAWS EXIST TO BE CHANGED NOT ENFORCED DEMOCRATS KEEP LOOKING FOR WAYS TO STEAL PEOPLES MONEY AND REPUBLICANS LOOK FOR WAYS TO TRANSFER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS INTO PRIVATE INDUSTRY AT A LOSS TO US THE WHOLE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS SET UP TO INDOCTRINATE THE YOUTH TO THE IDEALS OF THE OLDER GENERATION LIFE IS THE MATRIX EITHER BE A SHEEP AND ROBOT OR FIGHT FOR CHANGE
YOU GOTTA LOOK AT SOCIETY NOW

COMMON CORE MATH IS RUINING PHILOSOPHY BY BASICALLY STATING 2 2 DOES NOT EQUAL

AND AND ANOTHER AND MAKE IT'S A BIT RIDICULOUS THAT THEY'RE MAKING KIDS TAKE EXTRA STEPS TO SOLVE SIMPLE PROBLEMS

THEN THERE'S THE WHOLE ANTI BULLYING CAMPAIGN AS IF THAT WILL END ALL OF BULLYING HATE TO SAY IT ADULTHOOD IS DOG EAT DOG

BASICALLY OUR SOCIETY NOW IS MORE WORRIED ABOUT OUR KIDS SELF ESTEEM MORE THAN IF THEY SUCCEED OR FAIL THEY WANT TO TEACH KIDS THEY WILL NEVER FAIL WHICH IS PERCENT INCORRECT EVERYONE FAILS AT SOME POINT AND TIME IT'S HOW YOU RECOVER THAT MAKES THEM SUCCEED OR FAIL PERMANENTLY

SOCIETY IS SOFT LOGIC IS COLD AND HONEST NOT SURE IF THE KIDS OR FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH HALF THE ADULTS COULD HANDLE THE CAPACITY FOR PHILOSOPHY I JUST GOT FINISHED MY INTRO TO IT AND I LOVED IT I DO AGREE IT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE GOOD LOGICAL DECISIONS IN LIFE INSTEAD OF THAT'S HOW I FELT LIKE DOING IT
WHO NEEDS PHILOSOPHY WHEN WE HAVE ART AND GENDER STUDIES
NO PHILOSOPHY SHOULD NOT BE IN K EDUCATION IT'S TOO COMPLEX AND THERE IS NO TIME I KNOW I KNOW YOU ARE A COLLEGE STUDENT AND YOU THINK YOU KNOW IT ALL TRUST ME YOU DON'T I TOOK PHILOSOPHY IN COLLEGE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST WASTES OF TIME I'VE EVER HAD TO ENDURE WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE KIDS ASKING IF WE ARE REALLY HERE OR IF THEIR DESK EXISTS THAT'S NOT A VALUABLE LIFE SKILL THAT CREATES WEALTH
YEP PHILOSOPHY

JUST IMAGINE THE POLITICS HERE WE CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON WHAT SCIENCE MEANS WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC EDUCATION

I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE TERM IS SOMEWHAT CONVOLUTED IT ISN'T REALLY BUT IT CAN EASILY BE SPUN OUT OF CONTROL IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE
MY ENGLISH TEACHER TRIED TO TEACH US PHILOSOPHY IN HIS SPARE TIME

HE ALSO SAID THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF THE IDEOLOGIES OF NIETZSCHE AND DARWIN LITERAL HITLER

THERE ARE SOME AMAZING TEACHERS IN THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE A TON OF TERRIBLE ONES AS WELL THAT WOULD COMPLETELY BUTCHER SUCH A SUBJECT
BUT THE HOW WOULD THEY BRAINWASH US WE CAN'T THINK FOR OURSELVES
I AGREE AND KUDOS FOR THE ALL WRITTEN MISSION STATEMENT AT YOUR GRADE LEVEL
A PERSONALLY COME FROM A FAMILY OF RADICAL FANATIC RELIGIOUS FOLK THEIR AFTERLIFE BELIEFS WELL FAR FROM REALISTIC WHEN NUMBERS AND POPULATION GROWTH AND MANY OTHER PERIMETERS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT YET I PERSONALLY HAVE SOME ABILITIES THAT COUNT AS A THAT SOME FOLK CANT EXPLAIN SO THEIR USED THEIR RELIGIOUS INTERPRETATIONS AS A SECURITY BLANKET OF COMPREHENSION AND UNDERSTANDING HISTORY OF RELIGION THROUGH TIME AND THE OPPORTUNISTS THAT EXPLOITED THE FOLK THROUGH THEM FOR EASY FINANCIAL GAINS WELL I THINK I CAN LEAVE THAT STATEMENT AS IS HUMANS SOME HUMANS MAKE OTHER ANIMALS LOOK LIKE SAINTS DEPENDING ON THEIR GREED LEVELS AND WANTS HERD MENTALITY IS ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE IN AMERICA FOR INSTANCE HOW MANY GIRLS WANT A PRINCESS OR LITTLE MERMAID BACKPACK CERTAIN PAIR OF NAMEBRAND CLOTHES ECT EVEN POLITICS ARE SO SEPARATED BECAUSE ITS EASIER TO JUST GO WITH A PARTY THAN DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND THAT IS SAYING THE PERSON HAS THE EDUCATION KNOWLEDGE TO DO THE RESEARCH IN THE FIRST PLACE USING THE RIGHT TOOLS SO PHILOSOPHY TEACHER IN THE SCHOOLS THAT IS A BRILLIANT IDEA ONE PROBLEM THOUGH AS ALWAYS FUNDING AGAIN BACK TO ISSUE NUMERAL UNO IN THE GOOD OLE USA VALUE ANOTHER PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR AGES HENCE THE WHOLE SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM STANDPOINTS WHICH AMERICA HAS THEM INCLUDES IN THEIR DEMOCRACY YET THE TEND TO CRINGE WHEN DISCUSSED BECAUSE OF ALL THE HERD DIRECTING POLITICIANS THAT FRANKLY DONT GET THE CONCEPTS THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS INCLUDED THEM BOTH HAVE TOO OR IT WOULD BASICALLY BE ANARCHY WITHOUT A SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR FOLK THAT FALL IN THE CRACKS BUT YES KIDS SHOULD BE TALKED TO ABOUT MANY ISSUES IN A THOUGHT PROVOKING AND ASSOCIATION TYPE PROCESS ESPECIALLY IF THEIR NOT RECEIVING THOSE QUESTIONS AND EDUCATION AT HOME I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE AND HAD TO START LOOKING OUTSIDE THE BOX MYSELF GOT MY WHIPPINGS FOR IT TOO FANATICS AND THEIR SECURITY BLANKETS ITS EASIER TO DIE IF YOU HAVE A CONCEPT OF AN AFTERLIFE THAT WORKS FOR OR AGAINST I HAVE NO ANSWERS ABOUT AN AFTERLIFE WONT KNOW TILL YA GET THERE AND I DONT LIKE LYING ABOUT SOMETHING I DONT KNOW THOUGH I HAVE CURSED A FEW FOLK THAT EUPLOID ME HA EVEN THE GREAT PHILOSOPHERS TALKED ABOUT CERTAIN HEALING POWERS AND SORRY TO TAKE IT THEIR DISCUSSING BELIEFS TRADITIONS RITUALS IT IS ALL GOOD CONVERSATION AS LONG AS YOU HAVE AN OPEN MIND I'M SURE KINDERGARTNERS COULD START THINKING LIKE PHILOSOPHERS DR SUESS MANY MANY SYMBOLIC ASSOCIATIONS A FEW FOLK JUST READ CAUSE OF THE ILLUSTRATIONS AND WORDING
EEEEEVERYBODY THINKS THEIR PET SUBJECT SHOULD BE A CORE CLASSICAL IF WE CAN JUST MAKE PEOPLE LITERATE AND NUMERATE THEY CAN STUDY ANYTHING THEY WANT INDEPENDENTLY INSTEAD WE FORCE MORE AND MORE INTO THE CURRICULUM AND GIVE THEM A WATERED-DOWN COMIC BOOK VERSION OF THE REAL THING THAT WILL REPEL MORE POTENTIAL ADHERENTS THAN IT WILL WIN OVER
IF THEY WOULD DO IT RIGHT SURE I DON'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN THAT THOUGH

PHILOSOPHY WOULDN'T JIVE WITH OUR CURRENT ACADEMIC FOCUS IN THE STATES
OP IS A YOUNG PADAWAN WITH MUCH TO LEARN

LOGIC IS ONLY ONE TOOL IN THE PHILOSOPHERS TOOL BOX PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE RAW APPLICATION OF LOGIC TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION A REVISION OF HIS HYPOTHETICAL CONVERSATION

I THINK ALL OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS COUNTRY

WHY WHAT NEGATIVE IMPACT DO THEY HAVE

MIGHT AS WELL ASK WHICH COUNTRY WHY SHOULD THESE PEOPLE GET OUT WHY ARE THEY CALLED ILLEGAL

WELL THEY TAKE OUR JOBS

BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH SAYS THEY DON'T

MIGHT AS WELL ASK HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM AND WHY DOES THAT BOTHER YOU OR WHY IS THIS A BAD THING

BUT WHAT MAKES THEM ENTITLED TO US CITIZENSHIP

MIGHT AS WELL ASK HERE AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION WHY DO YOU OR US CITIZENS FEEL ENTITLED TO CERTAIN JOBS WHY ARE YOU ENTITLED OR WHAT MAKES YOU ENTITLED TO US CITIZENSHIP WHY ARE YOU AND US CITIZENS ENTITLED TO A COUNTRY

PHILOSOPHY IS MOST POWERFUL WHEN AN ARGUMENT IS REDUCED TO IT'S FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES AND THEN THOSE PRINCIPLES ARE UNIVERSALIZED AND TESTED FOR THEIR VALIDITY
PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE TAUGHT THE SECOND YOU ARE CONCEIVED AND ARE SHOT INSIDE YOUR MOTHER'S WOMB
THIS WOULDN'T WORK UNFORTUNATELY YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IT SHOULD BE A SERIES OF CLASSES BUT EVEN THEN IT WOULD BE TOO INTENSE FOR MOST STUDENTS AND DOESN'T PREPARE THEM FOR THE BASICS OF SURVIVAL IN THE MODERN WORLD THAT WE BARELY MANAGE TO STUFF INTO THEIR BRAINS ALREADY WRITING COHERENTLY ENOUGH READING COMPREHENSION TO UNDERSTAND DOCUMENTS DOING MATH FOR CHECKING AND TAKING OUT LOANS ETC THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF EDUCATION PREPARING THEM FOR COLLEGE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LUXURY OF HIGH SCHOOL AND THESE DAYS IT'S NOT EVEN THAT WE JUST NEED KIDS TO GRADUATE WHO CAN EVEN SURVIVE

BUT MORE TO THE POINT PHILOSOPHY REQUIRES ABSTRACT REASONING WHICH KIDS DON'T DEVELOP THE CAPACITY FOR UNTIL LATE MIDDLE OR EARLY HIGH-SCHOOL THEY DON'T DEVELOP CONCRETE REASONING UNTIL AROUND 1ST GRADE AND EVEN TRYING TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY USING CONCRETE EXAMPLES WOULD BE SERIOUSLY COMPROMISING ITS VERY PURPOSE AND CORE CONCEPTS YOU CAN PUT TWO APPLES IN FRONT OF A 3RD GRADER AND SAY 2 YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO THEM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU EAT THE APPLE AND THE APPLE EATS YOU YOU CAN'T DESCRIBE FREE WILL TO THEM YOU CAN'T EVEN REALLY START GRAMMAR OR ALGEBRA UNTIL THEY'RE NEARING ABSTRACT REASONING PHILOSOPHY THEY WOULD LITERALLY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND IT

IT'S MUCH BETTER TO PUSH FOR COLLEGES HAVING FREE COMMUNITY CLASSES THAN TO TRY TO INTEGRATE IT INTO PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR KIDS AND WITH THE WAY COLLEGE TUITIONS ARE CHANGING TO ALLOW ONE OR TWO FREE YEARS OF COLLEGE EDUCATION PEOPLE ARE ALREADY GOING TO HAVE MORE ACCESS TO PHILOSOPHY COURSES THE BEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN IS A WESTERN HUMANITIES CLASS THAT BLENDED LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE TO SHOW HOW THE THREE HAVE SHAPED EACH OTHER OVER THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD TRYING TO PUSH FOR THAT TO BE A MORE COMMON GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT PHILOSOPHY
YOU GOT A FAIR POINT MATE DO NOT FEEL AFFECTED BY ALL THE SKEPTICAL BULLSHIT AROUND IT TAKES CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LOGIC TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE IT ANYWAYS YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED FORMAL LOGIC RATHER THAN PHILOSOPHY
THE ONLY ISSUE IS CORE CLASSES IN AND OF THEMSELVES ARE ALREADY FLAWED IN THE RESPECT THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY FOR CERTAIN TASKS WHILE PEOPLE LIKE US WOULD EXCEL AT PHILOSOPHY AT THE VERY LEAST A FEW WOULD NOT WHILE I WOULDN'T MIND IT AVAILABLE AS AN ELECTIVE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO EVERYONE TO MAKE IT REQUIRED
K

MAYBE BUT DEFINITELY NOT KINDERGARTEN

CAN YOU IMAGINE YEAR OLDS DEBATING THE MEANING OF NIETZSCHE
THANK GOT I KNOW HOW TO CALCULATE THE PARABOLA OF MY PISS STREAM AND NOT HOW TO FORM A PROPER VALID ARGUMENT
K MMM BABY CARROTS
I HAVE BEEN LIED TO MY WHOLE LIFE THESE ARE REGULAR CARROTS CUT INTO SMALL PIECES
I HOPE U DON'T HAVE CHILDREN
DELETED
BUT THAT MIGHT MAKE LITTLE TIMMY QUESTION THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

WE CAN'T HAVE THAT IN PUBLIC SCHOOL
K EH I'M DOWN FOR THAT AND WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO GREAT EARLY EDUCATION CLASSES SUCH AS AESTHETICS AND FINGER PAINTING BOYS AND GIRLS GETTING ALONG A STUDY IN FEMINIST THEORY AND I GOTTA GO PEE HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW
CRITICAL THINKING IS STRESSED AS THE CORE FOR THE GIFTED AND TALENTED TYPE PROGRAMS FOR ELEMENTARY MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AND AP COURSES ARE ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE BASED OFF OF THIS AS A CORE

THE PROBLEM IS THAT THOSE KIDS WHO DON'T GET THOSE COURSES OFTEN DON'T ATTEMPT TO THINK CRITICALLY
OH GOOD GOD NUMBER

WE'RE ALREADY SEEING PHILOSOPHY TURN INTO THE STUDY OF APPLIED LOGIC IN HIGHER EDWARD PLEASE DON'T ROB FUTURE CHILDREN OF BEING ABLE TO DISCOVER PHILOSOPHY ON THEIR OWN IF YOU FORCE IT ON EVERYONE NO ONE WILL DO IT RIGHT IF YOU FORCE IT ON NO ONE A FEW WILLIAM
YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT DRINK

UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE ONLY LEARN IF THEY WANT TO MATH IS MANDATORY IN HIGH SCHOOL YET SO MANY PEOPLE LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL NOT KNOWING HOW TO SOLVE ANYTHING PAST BASIC VARIABLE EQUATIONS LET ALONE ANYTHING LIKE INTEGRATION OR TRIGONOMETRY OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE THEM HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING OR VALUE IN A MATHEMATICAL CONVERSATION

PHILOSOPHY ISN'T MUCH DIFFERENT EXCEPT WITH PHILOSOPHY YOU WILL BE FORCED TO MEMORIZE A BUNCH OF NAMES AND DATES AND IT WILL OVERALL MAKE FOR AN OBNOXIOUS CLASSICAL

PEOPLE DON'T RESPECT OTHER PEOPLES IDEAS NOT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T EDUCATED IN THAT REGARD IT'S BECAUSE THEIR NEED FOR SELF VALIDATION AND OFTEN GROUP VALIDATION BLINDS THEM NOBODY WANTS TO BE WRONG SO THEY ASSUME PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM ARE A THREAT OR AN EVIL

KNOWING YOUR OWN MENTAL LIMITS AND PROCESSES AND BEING OPEN-MINDED IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE YOU CAN'T TEACH THAT THEY HAVE TO LEARN IT

I'M TRYING TO FREE YOUR MIND NEO BUT I CAN ONLY SHOW YOU THE DOOR YOU'RE THE ONE THAT HAS TO WALK THROUGH IT MORPHEUS FROM THE MATRIX EXPLAINING IN A NUTSHELL WHY OUR WORLD IS THE WAY IT IS




THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE USE WHAT IS TAUGHT TO THEM UNLESS IT'S ACTIVELY USED EVERY DAY AS LOVELY AS IT IS TO HAVE PHILOSOPHY TAUGHT THERE'S NO WAY IT APPLIES TO MY JOB IT'S VERY ANALYTICAL I'D LOSE IT I DARESAY MOST PEOPLE HAVE JOBS THAT PHILOSOPHY HAS LITTLE BEARING ON TEACHING THEM PHILOSOPHY WOULD JUST MAKE THEM BORED IN YET ANOTHER CLASS WITH LITTLE RESULT

PLUS YOU KNOW HOW A FRESHMAN THINKS THEY KNOW EVERYTHING BUT THEY ONLY KNOW ENOUGH TO BE DANGEROUS IMAGINE IF EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT WITH PHILOSOPHY
GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT I DO NOT THINK IT WOULD BE VERY PRODUCTIVE TO INTRODUCE PHILOSOPHY TO A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE THOSE THAT ARE INTERESTED WON'T BE PERMITTED TO PUT ENOUGH TIME INTO THE SUBJECT AS INTENDED BY HOW THE STUDENT'S TIME IS STRUCTURED AS WELL
THIS IS JUST A WAY OF INDOCTRINATING CHILDREN WITH YOUR OWN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL VIEWS

YOU APPARENTLY THINK THE PHILOSOPHY IS THE PART YOU LIKE BUT IT
RUNS THE GAMUT FROM COMMUNISTS TO FASCISTS FROM ATHEISTS TO SPIRITUALISTS FROM RADICAL TO SOCIOPATHS IVORY-TOWER NERDS TO PSYCHOPATHS

WHAT DISTINGUISHES PHILOSOPHY FROM SCIENCE IS THAT ONE IS BASED ON EXPERIMENT OBSERVATIONS AND FACTS AND THE OTHER IS PRIMARILY UNSUPPORTED SPECULATION WHICH IS BETTER TO ENCOURAGE LOGICAL THINKING

AND WHO IS GOING TO CHOOSE THE PHILOSOPHY CURRICULUM OBVIOUSLY YOU THINK THAT YOU WILLIAM
A BASEBALL AND A BAT COST THE BAT COST MORE HOW MUCH DOES BASEBALL COST I'M SURE MOST HAVE HEARD OF THIS QUIZ AND MANY HAVE FAILED IT EVERYONE IS EQUIPPED WITH THE SKILLS BASIC MATH AND ALGEBRA TO SOLVE IT BUT MANY FAILED WHAT MAKES YOU THINK TEACHING LOGIC IN SCHOOL WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT

SCHOOL EQUIP STUDENTS WITH TOOLS KNOWLEDGE BUT WILL STUDENTS USE IT IS ANOTHER PROBLEM
SO SHOULD CRITICAL THINKING

THESE ARE ABSENT FROM PUBLIC SCHOOL BECAUSE PUBLIC SCHOOL IS MEANT TO KEEP THE POPULACE JUST SMART ENOUGH TO PULL THE LEVER BUT NOT SMART ENOUGH TO DO MUCH ELSE

PUBLIC SCHOOL IS A TOOL TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IN LINE
IN THE BIBLE NAHUM IT DOESN'T GIVE ANYTHING USEFUL FOR THE REAL LIFE LEAVE WHERE'S AT
INTO TO LOGIC INTO TO PHILOSOPHY LOGIC YES PHILOSOPHY NUMBER NOW CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS LIKE PROGRAMMING
REMOVED
SCIENCE IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THINKING ABOUT A BUNCH OF RANDOM SCENARIOS AND UNANSWERABLE QUESTIONS
SOMETHING ALREADY TEACHES YOU ALL OF THIS OR AT LEAST THE PRINCIPAL BEHIND THE LOGICAL CONCEPTS YOU MENTION

IT IS CALLED MATHEMATICS
RIGHT BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY WANT THE STATE TEACHING IMPRESSIONABLE CHILDREN THEIR PHILOSOPHY NO TOTALITARIAN STATE HERE
SAYING PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE A MANDATORY COURSE ON R PHILOSOPHY YOU ARE SO BRAVE SUCH COURAGE WOW
WE ALREADY HAVE PEOPLE ARGUING THAT ALGEBRA SHOULD BE BANNED I FEEL LIKE THE SAME WOULD HAPPEN WITH AN ABSTRACT DIFFICULT CLASSICAL
NO IT SHOULDN'T

I LOVE PHILOSOPHY I THINK IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT KIDS SHOULD HAVE A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF IT ENTERING ADULTHOOD

HAVING SAID THAT IF YOU WANT THIS TO WORK IT HINGES ON THE IDEA OF IT BEING TAUGHT WELL WHICH IT WILL LIKELY NOT BE YOU'RE GOING TO FACE LAZY TEACHERS ALL MEMORIZATION KIDS ARE GOING TO BE INUNDATED WITH THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY RATHER THAN ACTUAL PHILOSOPHY IT'S GOING TO BE BAD NEWS ALL AROUND UNLESS A CURRICULUM CAN BE PROPERLY STRUCTURED AND THAT CURRICULUM ADHERED TO

I DIDN'T TAKE ANY PHILOSOPHY IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT TOOK INTRO PHILOSOPHY IN COLLEGE AND IT WAS HORRIBLE I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON JUMPING FROM ONE BIG NAME PHILOSOPHER TO THE NEXT INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY EXPLORING AND UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENT IDEAS AND SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT I LEARNED MUCH MORE LOGIC THROUGH MY HIGHER LEVEL MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES BUT TO BE FAIR THAT IS PROBABLY ALL A STRICTER DEFINITION OF LOGIC THAN PHILOSOPHY IS
PHILOSOPHY IS KINDA POINTLESS IT CAME ABOUT FROM PEOPLE SITTING AROUND WITH TOO MUCH TIME ON THEIR HANDS THINKING ABOUT LIFE AND THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING IN IT IF THEY WANTED TO BE REALLY PRODUCTIVE THEY COULD HAVE STUDIED IT BETTER BUT TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE BEING WHAT THEY WERE IT WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN THAT SAID ITS BETTER NOW BECAUSE WE CAN PHYSICALLY STUDY AND UNDERSTAND OUR WORLD WITH SCIENCE

WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH IT GO INTO BUSINESS WANT TO FIGURE OUT IF THAT IS RIGHT OR WRONG GO INTO LAW WANT TO MAKE LAWS ABOUT IT GO INTO POLITICS

I MEAN PHILOSOPHY CAME ABOUT BECAUSE SCIENCE AND MATH WEREN'T AROUND YET NOW THAT THEY ARE YOU REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON STEM DON'T MAKE OTHERS WASTE THEIR TIME WITH POINTLESS CLASSES LIKE ARTS AND PHILOSOPHY UNLESS THEY WANT THEM IN WHICH CASE IT ISN'T A WASTE YOU NEED THEM TO FOCUS ON STEM AND BUSINESS AND MEDICINE AND LAW STUFF THAT REALLY MATTERS IN THE SOCIETY WE HAVE
BUT THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE MISSION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM ITS JOB IS TO MAKE COGS NOT THINKERS
NO YOU'LL JUST LEARN STATE SANCTIONED PHILOSOPHY

IT MIGHT LEGITIMATELY BE DANGEROUS IMO
NO IT SHOULDNT
MOST K HAVE THE REASONING SKILLS TO UNDERSTAND BUT MOST DEVELOPMENTALLY JUST AINT THERE IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING I THINK IT'D BE A WASTE

IN TERMS OF BROADENING HORIZONS I THINK A CULTURES CLASS COULD HELP
REMOVED
YEA SURE I AGREE AND THINK EVERY HIGH SCHOOLER OUGHTA READ ATLAS SHRUGGED PROBABLY IN GRADE WHEN THEY ARE TO BOTH BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE THEM PURPOSE BEHIND PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS BUT ALSO AS A FORM OF IMMUNIZATION LEG UP ON PHILOSOPHY INSTRUCTION THEY MAY RECEIVE LATER
I THINK ALL OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS COUNTRY

WHY WHAT NEGATIVE IMPACT DO THEY HAVE

WELL THEY TAKE OUR JOBS

IF THEY BROKE THE LAW TO GET HERE THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM BREAKING THE LAW WHEN THEY GET HERE

THIS AIN'T ROCKET SCIENCE

TAKE YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS TO R POLITICS PLEASE

SCREW PHILOSOPHY COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHES YOU LOGIC ABSTRACT THOUGHT AND PROBLEM SOLVING

EDIT I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO PUT THIS EDIT HERE BUT PEOPLE ARE SO GOD DAMN STUPID THEY SEE THE SCREW PHILOSOPHY PHRASE I USED WHILE BEING HYPERBOLIC AND DECIDE TO FILL IN THE BLANKS OF MY ARGUMENT WITHOUT ACTUALLY DELVING DEEPER TO WHAT I'VE ACTUALLY SAID

I'M NOT CLAIMING COMPUTER SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY I'M CLAIMING THAT COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY EMPTY SET THERE IS OVERLAP OP ARGUES PHILOSOPHY CONTAINS LOGIC AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO LEARN WELL LOGIC IS WITHIN THE SET OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY I'M ARGUING THAT WHAT'S IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY WOULD BE MORE USEFUL IN SOCIETY THAN WHAT IS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY POOR ARGUMENT THAT SEEMS LIKE A VARIATION OF THE IS OUGHT PROBLEM THAT I SEE IN A LOT OF PESSIMISTIC PHILOSOPHY THEY TAKE A SET OF FACTS ABOUT THE UNIVERSE AND COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT LIFE IS MISERABLE WE CAN'T DO MORE THAN EVOLUTION ALLOWS US IT'S HORRIBLE IT'S TRAGIC BUT GOING FROM OUR CONSTRAINTS TO THE TRAGEDY IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE AND DOESN'T FOLLOW FROM ANY LOGIC OR RATIONALITY LIKEWISE THE PREMISE IS SORT OF OBVIOUS I DOUBT MANY PEOPLE WOULD CLAIM THAT SPECIES SENSES WERE NOT BOUNDED BY EVOLUTION AND PHYSICS BUT WE CAN TURN THIS WHOLE THING ON ITS HEAD FOR EXAMPLE THE ONLY REASON WE SEE COLOR IS BECAUSE OUR MONKEY ANCESTORS HAD TO DETERMINE IF BANANAS WERE RIPE ISN'T THAT NEAT ISN'T THAT AWESOME AGAIN THE CONCLUSION DOESN'T FOLLOW FROM THE PREMISE BUT IF WE HAVE THE CHOICE ITSELF ITS OWN DEBATE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SADNESS AND HAPPINESS WOULDN'T WE CHOOSE THE HAPPIER USE OF OUR ATTENTION IN CONCLUSION THE BUDDHA SHAKES HIS HEAD AT THE AUTHORS SHENANIGANS
FAVOURED ANALOGY IS THE DESKTOP INTERFACE

WHEN YOU CLICK A SQUARE BLUE ICON TO OPEN A DOCUMENT THE FILE ITSELF IS NOT A BLUE SQUARE THING HE SAYS

YOU KNOW I THINK WE WERE DOING PRETTY OKAY WHEN ALL WE HAD WERE PUPPETS AND SHADOWS IN CAVES
OUR BRAINS ONLY HAVE SO MUCH MEMORY OUR BRAINS HAVE ONLY SO MUCH PROCESSING POWER PROCESSING SPEED OUR SENSES ONLY EXTEND SO FAR INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE DOMAINS FREQUENCY OF SOUNDS WE CAN HEAR SENSITIVITY OF SKIN ETC THEORETICALLY MORE MEMORY MORE PROCESSING POWER MORE SENSATION WOULD BE BETTER BUT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE HUMANS EAT MORE FOOD ON AVERAGE HUMANS EVER STARVE NOT ALL HUMANS EAT ENOUGH AS IT IS

THEREFORE YES OUR ABILITIES ARE CONSTRAINED BY WHAT OUR ANCESTORS COULD CONSUME HOORAY GENETICS THEORETICALLY OVER MANY GENERATIONS OUR CAPACITY OUGHT TO IMPROVE AS AVERAGE HUMAN NUTRITION CONTINUES TO IMPROVE THOUGH SELECTIVE PRESSURE FOR INTELLIGENCE IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT MAY HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY

THEREFORE THERE ARE MANY THINGS OUR BRAINS ARE THEORETICALLY CAPABLE OF BUT WE ARE RESTRICTED BY WHAT OUR ANCESTORS COULD SUSTAIN THE ECONOMY OF ATP THUS THE IDEA THAT EVERYTHING THAT DEVELOPED IS NECESSARY IS NOT STRICTLY TRUE BUT IT IS TRUE THAT OUR CAPACITY IS LIMITED BY WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE
IS THIS THE SAME DOCTOR WHO TALKED ABOUT A RELATIVELY SIMILAR IDEA IN THE ATLANTIC A FEW MONTHS BACK
CONSCIOUSNESS CREATED EVOLUTION AND THROUGH EVOLUTION PHYSICAL LIFE HAS EVOLVED NUMEROUS SENSES ONE OF WHICH IS SIGHT THROUGH WHICH CONSCIOUSNESS CAN NOW SEE THE UNIVERSE IN 3D AND THROUGH MATHEMATICAL COMPUTATIONAL TRIAL AND ERROR HELPS GUIDE HUMANITY TO EVOLVE FURTHER AND MANIPULATE THE UNIVERSAL ENVIRONMENT CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE ENABLER
THIS IS MORE OF A SKEPTICISM THAN A DEFENSE OF HIS CLAIM
EVOLUTION ISN'T ABOUT TRUTH IT'S ABOUT MAKING KIDS EVERY BIT OF INFORMATION THAT YOU PROCESS COSTS CALORIES MEANING THAT'S MORE FOOD YOU NEED TO KILL AND EAT SO AN ORGANISM THAT SEES ALL OF REALITY WOULD NEVER BE MORE FIT THAN ONE TUNED ONLY TO SEE WHAT IT NEEDS TO SURVIVE

AND THIS EXPLAINS THINGS LIKE BELIEVING IN GOD
WHEN WE CONCLUDE THAT NOT EVERYTHING INVOLVED IN A HUMAN IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REPRODUCTION EVOLUTION SURVIVAL THIS ARGUMENT SEEMS TO FALL
ALL THIS TIME SPENT DEVELOPING A GOOD MATERIALIST PHILOSOPHY OF NEUROSCIENCE AND THEY SLIP RIGHT BACK INTO THE CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE OF CARTESIAN DUALISM AT EVERY CHANCE
I HAVE READ MORE ZEN BOOKS THAN KANT BOOKS SO MY VIEW ON ETHICS IS THAT IT CANNOT BE INTELLECTUAL IT NEEDS TO BE PRACTICAL NOT THAT KANT WAS AN IMPRACTICAL PHILOSOPHER I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S REALLY POSSIBLE BUT WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF KANT AND SUCH THEY TEND TO THINK INTELLECTUALLY

MY CONTRIBUTION TO YOU IS THAT IF ALL OF THIS WRITING READING AND THINKING ABOUT ETHICS HAS LEAD TO JUST ONE ATTEMPT AT PRACTICAL MORALITY YOU HAVE NOT WASTED YOUR TIME REMEMBER WHAT MORALITY REALLY MEANS
ONLY CONFUSED PEOPLE HAVE EVER THOUGHT THE CI WAS ABOUT JUDGING ACTIONS IT'S OBVIOUSLY ABOUT JUDGING MAXIMS OR AS YOU CALL THEM MOTIVES KANT EXPLICITLY SAID THAT AND EVERYONE SINCE THEN WHO HAS EVEN A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF KANT HAS TAKEN IT LIKE THAT SO WHEN YOU ASK IF THERE ARE ANY PROMINENT PHILOSOPHERS WHO HAVE HAD SIMILAR INTERPRETATIONS OF KANTIANISM THE ANSWER IS YES LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
NICE SITE I'D INCLUDE SOCIAL SHARE BUTTONS SO THAT IT IS EASY TO SHARE WITH OTHERS GOOD WORK
THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY HELPFUL
I RECALL THOROUGHLY ENJOYING THIS THOUGHT PROVOKING READ MAYBE YEARS AGO FOUND IT IN MY MOTHER'S BOOK SHELF DEFINITELY WORTH A READ

SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO GEOFF LYNN NORTHERN ILLINOIS FOLLOWS UP ON HIS INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THINKING BY EXPLORING HOW DEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS GIVE US REASON TO BELIEVE THEIR CONCLUSIONS GOOD DEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS GUARANTEE THEIR CONCLUSIONS AND SO MUST BE VALID I EAST IT MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PREMISES TO BE TRUE WHILE THE CONCLUSION IS FALSE AND HAVE TRUE PREMISES PHILOSOPHERS CALL ARGUMENTS LIKE THESE SOUND YOU CAN SEE WHETHER AN ARGUMENT IS SOUND BY TRYING TO THINK OF A COUNTEREXAMPLE TO IT BUT TO SEE WHETHER ITS PREMISES ARE TRUE YOU NEED TO DO SOME RESEARCH

THANKS FOR WATCHING IF YOU LIKE OUR VIDEOS PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL

WIPHI
SORRY FOR BEING OF TOPIC BUT COULD PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT SOFTWARE WAS USED TO CREATE THIS VIDEO I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW THE CREATOR MADE THE HAND LOOK LIKE IT WAS WRITING THE WORDS AND DRAWING THE PICTURES
ARE DEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS AND SYLLOGISMS BASICALLY THE SAME THING
THE TRICK IS MANY ARGUMENTS ARE MADE THAT ARE MEANT TO SOUND DEDUCTIVE AND THEREFOR SEEM IRREFUTABLE THEY CAN BE PRETTY DECEPTIVE BECAUSE SPOTTING AN ARGUMENT THAT FOLLOWS A FORMAT BUT ISN'T DEDUCTIVE USUALLY TAKES TIME AND CLOSE EXAMINATION WHICH WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO ASK BUT DOES ANYONE KNOW A GOOD ONLINE COURSE IN LOGIC
MOST PHILOSOPHERS UNDERSTAND LOGIC

MOST LOGICIANS UNDERSTAND DEDUCTIVE REASONING

THEREFORE MOST PHILOSOPHERS UNDERSTAND DEDUCTIVE REASONING

AM I DOING THIS RIGHT
LOL I THOUGHT THIS ABOUT LOGIC THE RAPPER WHO WAS GOING TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT DEDUCTIVE THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT

BUT THIS WAS INFORMATIVE
SWEET THANKS FOR THE INFO GUYS
THIS WAS A GREAT REFRESHER AS A FORMER STUDENT OF PHILOSOPHY AND A LOVER OF LOGIC THIS WAS GREAT THANKS
WHILE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS SUB HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT IT BEFORE I STILL THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD INTRO VIDEO IT'S PERFECT FOR SCHOOLS AND CHILDREN I WISH MORE PEOPLE MADE THESE SUPER SIMPLE VIDEOS
IN MY MATH STUDIES DEDUCTION IS WHEN YOU APPLY UNIVERSAL GENERALITIES TO A PROBLEM TO COME UP WITH A SPECIFIC LOCAL ANSWER A DETECTIVE WILL DEDUCE WHERE SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IS BY APPLYING UNIVERSAL RULES OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR CLARICE STARLING AND THE FOLIO B I DEDUCED THE LOCATION OF BUFFALO BILL WITH THE HELP OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES PROVIDED BY HANNIBAL LECTER

INDUCTION IS HOW YOU COME UP WITH LAWS YOU TAKE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES AND PATTERNS AND COME UP WITH A UNIVERSAL GENERALITY NEWTON INDUCED THE LAW OF GRAVITY FROM THE VOLUMINOUS DATA OF KEPLER BRAHE AND COPERNICUS
AT FIRST I WAS THINKING WHY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE RAPPERS EXPLAINING DEDUCTIVE REASONING
GOOD BOOKS ON INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC AND MORE ADVANCED ONES

THANK YOU
DESPITE THE CLEAR CUT DEFINITION OF DEDUCTION AND INDUCTION PEOPLE IN THIS THREAD ARE STILL DISAGREEING ON WHAT CONSTITUTES INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION
I HAVEN'T WATCHED THE VIDEO SO I MAY BE RESTATING ITS CONTENTS BUT I THINK I CAN CONTRIBUTE HERE

A GOOD WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DEDUCTION IS TO COMPARE ITS DIFFERENCE TO INDUCTION VARYING IDEAS EXIST ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION

ONE STANDARD IDEA IS THAT IN DEDUCTION IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CONCLUSION TO BE FALSE GIVEN THAT THE PREMISES ARE TRUE WHEREAS IN INDUCTION IT IS IMPROBABLE FOR THE CONCLUSION TO BE FALSE GIVEN THAT THAT THE PREMISES ARE TRUE

DEDUCTION
ALL CATS ARE MAMMALS

ALL MAMMALS ARE ANIMALS

THEREFORE ALL MAMMALS ARE ANIMALS


INDUCTION
EVERY CAT I HAVE EVER OBSERVED IS AN ASSHOLE

I HAVE OBSERVED A GREAT NUMBER OF CATS

THEREFORE EVERY CAT IS AN ASSHOLE

NOTE IN INDUCTION SAMPLE SIZE IS A CONCEPT WHICH DEPENDING ON ITS STRENGTH LENDS A RELATIVE AMOUNT OF CREDIBILITY TO THE ARGUMENT IT PURPORTS TO SUPPORT

ANOTHER INTERPRETATION HOLDS THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INDUCTION AND DEDUCTION IS THAT
IN DEDUCTION CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN ABOUT A PARTICULAR THING BY ITS INCLUSION AS A MEMBER OF A THINGS WHEREAS IN INDUCTION CONCLUSIONS ARE DRAWN ABOUT THE CLASS BY OBSERVING FEATURES THAT OBSERVED MEMBERS OF THE CLASS HAVE THEN CONCLUDING THAT ALL MEMBERS OF THE CLASS INCLUDING UNOBSERVED ONES MUST HOLD THE SAME FEATURES


IN THAT SENSE DEDUCTION AND INDUCTION REASON IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS


ABSTRACT

THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RELATION BETWEEN THE EARLY WITTGENSTEIN S AND CARNAP S PHILOSOPHIES OF LOGIC ARGUING THAT CARNAP S POSITION IN THE LOGICAL SYNTAX OF LANGUAGE IS IN CERTAIN RESPECTS MUCH CLOSER TO THE TRACTATES THAN HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN CARNACIAN TERMS THE TRACTATES GOAL IS TO INTRODUCE BY MEANS OF SENTENCES SYNTACTICAL PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS TO BE USED IN PHILOSOPHICAL CLARIFICATION IN THE FORMAL MODE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE MATERIAL AND FORMAL MODE IS THEREFORE ALREADY PART OF THE TRACTATES VIEW AND ITS METHOD FOR INTRODUCING SYNTACTICAL CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES SHOULD BE ENTIRELY ACCEPTABLE FOR CARNAP BY HIS OWN CRITERIA MOREOVER DESPITE THE TRACTATES REJECTION OF SYNTACTICAL STATEMENTS THERE IS AN IMPORTANT CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN WITTGENSTEIN S DISTINCTION AND CARNAP S DISTINCTION BOTH CONSTITUTE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN DETERMINATIONS CONCERNING LANGUAGE AND LANGUAGE AS DETERMINED OR DESCRIBED BY THOSE DETERMINATIONS WITTGENSTEIN S DISTINCTION THEREFORE CONSTITUTES A PRECURSOR OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH THE LATTER IN A CERTAIN SENSE AFFIRMS RATHER THAN SIMPLY CONTRADICTING IT THE DISTINCTION AGREES WITH CARNAP S POSITION ALSO IN MARKING LOGIC AS SOMETHING THAT ISN T TRUE FALSE ABOUT EITHER LANGUAGE OR REALITY WHICH IS A CONCEPTION THAT UNDERLIES CARNAP S PRINCIPLE OF TOLERANCE

AUTHOR

ASKARI KUUSELA SENIOR LECTURER IN PHILOSOPHY UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGELA
LITERALLY EVERYONE ITT IS GETTING OBSESSED WITH THE LOGISTICS OF THIS AS IF IT WERE AN ACTUAL EXPERIMENT THIS IS EXACTLY WHY ENGINEERS MAKE TERRIBLE PHILOSOPHERS

THE POINT OF CLOCK ON A TRAIN IS TO UNDERSTAND LIGHT NOT TO MAKE A TRAIN GO LIGHTSPEED THE POINT OF CHALMERS IS TO ILLUSTRATE THAT NO PHYSICAL OBSERVATIONS COULD PROVE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE NOT TO ACTUALLY CONSTRUCT A PERFECT ZOMBIE DEVOID OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE POINT OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS TO POINT OUT THAT NO MATTER WHAT WE ALWAYS EXPERIENCE A TACIT BACKGROUND FUNDAMENTAL WE CAN'T EVER NOT EXPERIENCE IT WE DON'T NOTICE IT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN TAUGHT TO DO SO IF YOU NEVER LISTENED TO THE TONIC DRONE IN INDIAN MUSIC YOU MIGHT NEVER NOTICE IT IS THERE BUT ONCE YOU TAKE ALL THE INSTRUMENTS AWAY YOU REALIZE THE TONIC NOTE HAS BEEN PLAYING THIS WHOLE TIME AVICENNA IS POINTING OUT THAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS BASELINE IS BELOW THOUGHTS PERCEPTIONS AND SENSATIONS
I'D JUST LIKE TO ADD THIS ARTICLE SAYS HE WAS AN ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHER AND GIVES AN ARABIC TRANSLATION TO HIS NAME BUT HE WAS A PERSIAN PHILOSOPHER AND THE FATHER OF MEDICINE

HIS MOST FAMOUS WORKS ARE THE BOOK OF HEALING A PHILOSOPHICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ENCYCLOPEDIA AND THE CANON OF MEDICINE A MEDICAL ENCYCLOPEDIA WHICH BECAME A STANDARD MEDICAL TEXT AT MANY MEDIEVAL UNIVERSITIES AND REMAINED IN USE AS LATE AS IN CANON OF MEDICINE WAS REPRINTED IN NEW YORK

JUST TRYING TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE
NOW FOR THE THIRD AND HARDEST QUESTION WHAT DOES THE FLYING MAN THOUGHT EXPERIMENT PROVE

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BECAUSE THERE'S NO ARGUMENT MADE AS TO WHY THE FLYING MAN WOULD BE SELF-AWARE RATHER HE TAKES IT AS OBVIOUS

SO TRY TO IMAGINE SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE HAPPENING THAT NOBODY IN THE WORLD HAS EVER EVEN COME CLOSE TO EXPERIENCING USE YOUR INTUITION TO COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT'S SO OBVIOUS YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ARGUE FOR IT FROM THAT DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT STUFF THAT THE PEOPLE WITH ACTUAL EVIDENCE EITHER DISAGREE WITH OR HAVE SAID WE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE YET GREAT JOB THAT
THE WAY THIS EXAMPLE IS PRESENTED OF A MAN MATERIALIZED IN AIR IS RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS IF TAKEN LITERALLY

OBVIOUSLY IF YOU ARE IN AIR THEN YOU ARE ON A PLANET THIS PLANET HAS GRAVITY ETC SO STIMULI ARE A PLENTY I EAST THE SENSATION OF FALLING THE SOUND OF AIR THE PRESSURE OF AIR ON THE BODY ETC

BUT THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT AT ITS BASE SEEMS TO BE GETTING AT THE QUESTION OF DOES THE HUMAN BRAIN WITHOUT EXTERNAL STIMULI FUNCTION TO THE POINT OF DEVELOPING A CONSCIENCE

EVEN WITH MORALS AND ETHICS THROWN OUT THE WINDOW I DO NOT SEE HOW THE EXPERIMENT COULD BE DONE
I THINK THAT PRACTICALLY SPEAKING THIS MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT THE EVIDENCE POINTS TOWARDS A KIND OF MADNESS SETTING IN
FROM THE ARTICLE OUR SELF-AWARENESS IS A FOUNDATION FOR OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS IT S A SIGN OF THIS THAT WHEN I SEE IMAGINE OR THINK SOMETHING I CAN IMMEDIATELY APPREHEND THAT I AM SEEING IMAGINING OR THINKING ABOUT THAT THING ANY OTHER FORM OF COGNITION ANY AWARENESS OF OTHER THINGS PRESUPPOSES AWARENESS OF ONESELF

TO AN EXTENT I AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT BUT IT ALSO UNDERMINES THE AUTHOR'S CONCLUSION CONSIDER AN INFANT AFTER BEING BORN WE HAVE TO LEARN TO SEE LEARN TO WALK LEARN TO FORM MEMORIES LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR ETC NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE THOUGH WE CERTAINLY TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED NOW IF THE FLYING MAN IS BORN WITH THE SAME MIND WE ARE ALL BORN WITH THAT MAN WILL NOT RESPOND TO STIMULI IN THE WAY WE WOULD WOULD NOT FORM MEMORIES THE WAY WE DO WOULD NOT WALK TALK OR THEREFORE WE CANNOT USE ANY OF THESE TO DETERMINE IF THE FLYING MAN IS AWARE OF THEMSELVES SINCE THEY ARE ASSUREDLY NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING GOING ON AROUND THEM EVEN IF THEIR EYES WERE OPEN AND ARMS TOUCHING THEIR BODIES THE FLYING MAN WOULD HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO PROCESS THOSE EXPERIENCES

IN SHORT THE ARGUMENT OF THE FLYING MAN IS THAT BASIC SENSATION AND INTROSPECTION ASSUME A SENSE OF SELF THEREFORE WE ALL HAVE A SENSE OF SELF THE ISSUE IS THAT NEWBORNS DON'T HAVE SENSATION OR INTROSPECTION IN THE WAY THAT ADULTS DO THEREFORE THIS ARGUMENT CANNOT PROVE THAT INFANTS HAVE A SENSE OF SELF IN FACT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SELF AND OTHER IS A MILESTONE IN AN INFANT'S DEVELOPMENT
SO THIS PROFESSOR IS SUGGESTING THAT AVICENNA IS A DUALIST IDEALIST YOU D HAVE TO READ THE ORIGINAL ARABIC TO KNOW BETTER BUT FROM WHAT S SAID HERE I DON T THINK THAT S A NECESSARY CONCLUSION FOR THIS PROFESSOR TO CONCEDE FOR US YET DESPITE AVICENNA S POLEMICS MONIST MATERIALISM IS NOT REFUTED HERE THE EXPERIMENT THAT S SO POPULAR IN THIS PARTICULAR REGION OF GERMANY NOWADAYS SHOW S THAT THE PHYSICAL SENSES DO NOT NEED A PHYSICAL BODY TO TELL THE MIND THAT ITS AWARE OF ITS SELF AS A PERSON IT TELLS US THE BELIEF OF PHYSICAL PERSONHOOD IS MANIFESTED FROM THE PHYSICAL SENSE APPARATUS ITSELF NOT THE PHYSICAL BODY READ THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE VERY LITERALLY AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THE PROFESSOR LEAVES HIMSELF A CAVEAT THOSE WHO THINK GENERAL THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS ARE BULLOCKS FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS DEBATE ARE NOT YET WILLING TO ADMIT TO THEMSELVES THAT THEIR OWN CONSCIOUS PERSONAE IS MANIFEST THROUGH THOUGHT RE DESCARTES VS BLACKBURN
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE ONTOLOGY OF NEUROSCIENCE WHY WOULD A SIMULTANEOUS AND THE CORRESPONDING NEURONAL FIRING MEAN THAT WE HAVE FREE WILL OR NOT WOULDN'T IT JUST MEAN WE HAVE AN INSTANTANEOUS PROCESSOR I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT THE DETERMINISM OF THE SITUATION

ALSO HOW DO WE KNOW THE WILL EVEN OPERATES IN SUCH SHORT TIME FRAMES IF I REACT SAY TO SAVE A FRIEND FALLING OFF A BRIDGE I DID NOT ASSESS WHETHER TO RISK MY LIFE IN THAT MOMENT I DECIDED A LITTLE BIT EVERY DAY OF OUR FRIENDSHIP THAT I WAS WOULD BE WILLING TO RISK MY LIFE ON THEIR BEHALF ON AN EEG MY BRAIN WOULD APPEAR TO REACT DETERMINISTICALLY BUT I HAD ALREADY DECIDED LONG AGO

WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WITH SEVERE PHANTASIA

SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE IT SEVERELY ENOUGH HAVE EXTREMELY POOR AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY THEY LITERALLY CANNOT VISUALIZE A BEACH OR A SUNSET OR ANY OTHER SCENES EVEN FROM RECENT MEMORY THEY HAVE NO EYE

RATHER THAN A DUALISM THE CONDITION DESCRIBES A CONTINUUM OF CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCES ORDERED BY DEPTH OF VIVID INFORMATIONAL RECALL AND CONSTRUCTION

CONGENITAL PHANTASIA
M PLUMBED 2
THIS IS SOME SUPER MURKY AMATEUR LEVEL PHILOSOPHY IT'S VERY UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT POSITION HE'S ARGUING FOR ASIDE FROM SOMETHING MYSTERIOUSLY CALLED POETIC NATURALISM WHICH ACCORDING TO GOOGLE IS SOME KIND OF PHILOSOPHICAL VANITY PROJECT THAT THIS GUY A COSMOLOGIST APPARENTLY CAME UP WITH NO DOUBT ON HIS OWN IT FEELS LIKE A HALF-BAKED PASTICHE OF A LOT OF CLEARER BETTER ARTICULATED IDEAS FROM ACTUAL PHILOSOPHERS OF MIND

ACCORDING TO POETIC NATURALISM PHILOSOPHICAL ZOMBIES ARE SIMPLY INCONCEIVABLE BECAUSE CONSCIOUSNESS IS A PARTICULAR WAY OF TALKING ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF CERTAIN PHYSICAL SYSTEMS

OKAY SO IT'S BEHAVIORISM THEN OR

THE PHRASE EXPERIENCING THE REDNESS OF RED IS PART OF A HIGHER LEVEL VOCABULARY WE USE TO TALK ABOUT THE EMERGENT BEHAVIOR OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL SYSTEM NOT SOMETHING SEPARATE FROM THE PHYSICAL SYSTEM THAT DOESN T MEAN IT S NOT REAL MY EXPERIENCE OF REDNESS IS PERFECTLY REAL AS IS YOURS IT S REAL IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY AS FLUIDS AND CHAIRS AND UNIVERSITIES AND LEGAL CODES ARE REAL IN THE SENSE THAT THEY PLAY AN ESSENTIAL ROLE IN A SUCCESSFUL DESCRIPTION OF A CERTAIN PART OF THE NATURAL WORLD

THIS IMPLIES THAT AN EXPERIENCE OBTAINS IF AND ONLY IF IT IS A SUCCESSFUL DESCRIPTION OF SOMETHING WHICH ON ITS OWN IS A HUGELY CLAIM ONE FOR WHICH HE PROVIDES NO ARGUMENT HOWEVER IGNORING THIS THE LARGER ISSUE IS THAT EVEN IF IT WERE TRUE WHICH IT ISN'T IT STILL DOES NOTHING TO BRIDGE THE EXPLANATORY GAP PROPOSED BY CHALMERS HE DOESN'T EVEN ADDRESS THE INTERIORITY OF EXPERIENCE AND DOES NOTHING TO MAKE THE MIND BODY PROBLEM ANY LESS INTRACTABLE
CAN ZOMBIES POSSIBLY EXIST IF THEY CAN IT S A KNOCKOUT ARGUMENT AGAINST THE IDEA THAT CONSCIOUSNESS CAN BE EXPLAINED IN COMPLETELY PHYSICAL TERMS IF YOU CAN HAVE TWO IDENTICAL COLLECTIONS OF ATOMS BOTH OF WHICH TAKE THE FORM OF A HUMAN BEING BUT ONE HAS CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE OTHER DOES NOT THEN CONSCIOUSNESS CANNOT BE PURELY PHYSICAL

I THINK THE POINT OF A ZOMBIE IS THAT THEY'RE NOT A COLLECTION OF ATOMS IDENTICAL TO THE ORIGINAL LINEIFORM IF THEY WERE YOU'D STILL HAVE THE SAME LIVING BREATHING LINEIFORM IF A ZOMBIE DID EXIST IT MUST BE BY DEFINITION DIFFERENT FROM ITS ACTUALLY DEAD COUNTERPART WHICH IN TURN MUST BE DIFFERENT FROM THE LIVING BREATHING PERSON IT ONCE WAS
THIS IS GREAT

IMAGINE A ZOMBIE STUBBED ITS TOE IT WOULD CRY OUT IN PAIN BECAUSE THAT S WHAT A HUMAN WOULD DO AND ZOMBIES BEHAVE JUST LIKE HUMANS WHEN YOU STUB YOUR TOE CERTAIN ELECTROCHEMICAL SIGNALS BOUNCE AROUND YOUR CONNECTOME AND THE EXACT SAME SIGNALS BOUNCE AROUND THE ZOMBIE CONNECTOME IF YOU ASKED IT WHY IT CRIED OUT IT COULD SAY BECAUSE I STUBBED MY TOE AND IT HURTS WHEN A HUMAN SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE PRESUME IT S TELLING THE TRUTH BUT THE ZOMBIE MUST BE LYING BECAUSE ZOMBIES HAVE NO MENTAL STATES SUCH AS EXPERIENCING PAIN WHY DO ZOMBIES LIE ALL THE TIME

FOR THAT MATTER ARE YOU SURE YOU RE NOT A ZOMBIE YOU THINK YOU RE NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR OWN MENTAL EXPERIENCES YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT THEM IN YOUR JOURNAL OR SING SONGS ABOUT THEM IN A COFFEE SHOP BUT A ZOMBIE VERSION OF YOU WOULD DO THOSE THINGS AS WELL YOUR ZOMBIE DOPPELGANGER WOULD SWEAR IN ALL SINCERITY THAT IT HAD INNER EXPERIENCES JUST AS YOU WOULD YOU DON T THINK YOU RE A ZOMBIE BUT THAT S JUST WHAT A ZOMBIE WOULD SAY

AS USUAL ON THIS SUB ANY COMMENT THAT DOESN'T DIRECTLY RESPOND TO THE OP WILL BE DELETED WITHOUT COMMENT THIS ISN'T A CATCH-ALL THREAD ON ISSUES RELATING TO TRUTH AND CATCH-ALL THREADS ARE DEEPLY UNPRODUCTIVE
I HATE IT WHEN THEY USE 2 2 AS AN EXAMPLE PEOPLE GET HUNG UP ON WHETHER THAT'S SIMPLY TRUE BY DEFINITION AND WHETHER IT HOLDS IN BASE AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER BAGGAGE THAT IS ORTHOGONAL TO THE QUESTION

I THINK A BETTER EXAMPLE WOULD BE SOMETHING ABOUT THE NATURAL NUMBERS LIKE THAT SOME OF THEM ARE PRIME A GREAT THING ABOUT PRIME NUMBERS IS THAT THEY ARE VERY EASY TO REPRESENT IN THE REAL WORLD IF YOU HAVE K OBJECTS K IS PRIME IF YOU CAN'T ARRANGE THOSE OBJECTS INTO THE SHAPE OF A RECTANGLE FOR INSTANCE WITH K WE CAN GO LIKE





BUT IF K IS WE CAN ONLY GO



FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE THE PRIMENESS OF SEEMS PRETTY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER HUMANS ARE NEARBY ROCKS CAN'T BE ARRANGED INTO ROWS OF EQUAL LENGTH

PRIMENESS SEEMS TO BE A PROPERTY OF THE NUMBER ITSELF IT DOES NOT FOLLOW FROM THE DEFINITION OF IN ANY OBVIOUS WAY WOULD USUALLY BE DEFINED AS THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF THE SUCCESSOR OF WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DECIDE THAT YOU COULDN'T SPLIT INTO EQUAL GROUPS BUT IF HAS ITS OWN PROPERTIES DOESN'T THAT SUGGEST THAT IT EXISTS IN SOME OBJECTIVE SENSE

I'M GONNA RESPOND TO THIS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE COMMENTING SO FAR UNDERSTAND WHAT'S MEANT BY VS OBJECTIVE TRUTH THOUGH IT MAY FALL ON DEAF EARS SO LOW IN THE COMMENT THREAD THIS IS JUST AS I UNDERSTAND IT

SO TO BEGIN MODERNISM IN THIS CONTEXT ISN'T JUST A REFERENCE TO THE PRE CULTURAL STANCE OR THE VICTORIANS BUT A PHILOSOPHICAL BELIEF THAT THERE WERE CORRECT ANSWERS TO EVERYTHING THAT THE WORLD HAD A KNOWABLE STRUCTURE MADE EVIDENT BY SCIENCE WHICH EXTENDED FROM THE PRACTICAL MATH PHYSICS ENGINEERING INTO THE SOCIAL ART SOCIETY SOCIAL CLASS PHILOSOPHY THIS WAS THE BELIEF THAT THERE WERE THINGS A FINE LANDSCAPE PAINTING A PERFECT MATHEMATICAL EQUATION WHICH ARE ASPIRED TOWARDS BUT NOT NECESSARILY REACHED WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE YET AND RECOGNIZABLE BY ANYONE WHO ISN'T DEVIATED FROM THE CORRECT WAY IT'S BEEN CALLED POSITIVISM IT'S BEEN CALLED RELIGION IT'S BEEN CALLED RATIONALISM BUT IT'S BASICALLY BELIEF THAT ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD IS THE RIGHT WAY THAT FINDS THE TRUTH AND ANYONE WHO DOESN'T SEE IT HAS SIMPLY DEVIATED SOMEHOW AND IF THEY CORRECT THEMSELVES THEY WILL SEE IT TOO THE PHILOSOPHER SHOULD BEWARE OF SCIENCE ISM THAT PUSHES SUCH A VIEW IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY HONOUR DIGNITY RESPECT RATIONALITY PRECISION ETC

POSTMODERNISM IS A REBUTTAL TO MODERNISM OFTEN CHARACTERIZED BY ARTISTIC MOVEMENTS IN MEDIUMS THAT BREAK THE CONVENTIONAL MODERNIST AESTHETIC AND DO WEIRD THINGS THIS HAPPENS IN ALMOST EVERY MEDIUM AT SOME POINT PHILOSOPHICALLY IT'S THE BELIEF THAT THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE TRUTH THAT EACH PERSON EXPERIENCES THE WORLD IN HIS HER OWN WAY THAT'S EQUALLY AS TRUE AS THE NEXT IT SEES SCIENCE AS MERELY ONE INTERPRETATION OF THE WORLD AMONGST MANY WHICH IS USEFUL WHEN IN STERILE ENVIRONMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE EXPERIMENT CONDITIONS BUT OFTEN FALLS APART WHEN APPLIED TO ONE'S OWN EXPERIENCE IN EVERY ASPECT IT REJECTS SCIENCE AS A SOURCE OF ABSOLUTE TRUTH AND MEANING BUT IT ALSO REJECTS ANY OTHER SOURCE AS IT RECOGNIZES THAT AT BEST TRUTH IS RELATIVE AND SUBJECTIVE AS PEOPLE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IT'S RELATED TO NIHILISM AT LEAST THE POPULAR INTERPRETATION OF IT THE CHRISTIAN PURGATORY AND IS OFTEN CALLED MEANINGLESSNESS IT'S CLOSEST TO ATHEISM OR AGNOSTICISM OR SATANISM ETC FOR A STRONGER REJECTION OF OPPRESSIVE RATIONALITY A SCIENTIST WHO RECOGNIZES HIS WORK IS INTERESTING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF HIS FIELD BUT DOES NOT BELIEVE IN ITS UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY TO THE REAL WORLD WHO SEES IT LIKE WRITING ONE NOVEL AMONGST MANY MAY BE A POSTMODERNIST IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY IRONY INDIVIDUALITY INTENTIONAL WEIRDNESS REJECTION OF THE NORM HIPSTERISM ETC

IS THE DEBATEABLE FOLLOWUP TO POSTMODERNISM OFTEN IT IS JUST MISTAKEN FOR POSTMODERNISM BECAUSE IT STILL CLAIMS NO OBJECTIVE TRUTH AND ACCEPTS THAT ALL TRUTH MUST BE EXPERIENCED SUBJECTIVELY THROUGH THE LENS OF CULTURE AND THERE ARE MANY TRUTHS HOWEVER IT REJECTS THE MEANINGLESSNESS ASPECT OF POSTMODERNISM WHERE JUST BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SUBJECTIVE THERE IS NO COLLECTIVE TRUTH TO ASPIRE TO IT SEES TRUTH RATHER AS A DYNAMIC LIVING THING THAT CAN TAKE MANY FORMS BUT ISN'T JUST EQUAL EVERYWHERE THAT EACH PERSON CAN ASPIRE TO EXPERIENCE MEANING AND THIS MEANING CAN BE SHARED WITH OTHERS EVEN IF THEY COME FROM A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SUBJECTIVE REALITY IT RECOGNIZES THAT THE CULTURES OF THE WORLD ARE DIVERSE IN DETAIL BUT SIMILAR IN THEIR CORES THAT PEOPLE MAY EXPERIENCE TRUTH COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY BUT THEY ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS OF THE SAME LIGHT APPLIED TO SCIENCE IT'S RECOGNIZING THAT MANY PIECES IF NOT MOST OF OUR COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING ARE FLAWED AND NOBODY CAN POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND IT ALL THAT ANY UNDERSTANDING IS JUST ONE INTERPRETATION AMONGST MANY AND IT ISN'T TRUTH IN ITSELF AND NEVER WILL BE BUT IT STILL ALL POINTS TO THE TRUTH IN USEFUL REPLICABLE WAYS IT RECOGNIZES THAT ONLY BEING ABLE TO POINT AT THE TRUTH IS AN INHERENT LIMITATION OF LANGUAGE BUT IT'S THERE AND IT CAN BE FOUND FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS A POET AND A PHYSICIST MAY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN WAY OF SEEING IT THE MEANINGLESSNESS OF POSTMODERNISM IS BROUGHT BACK AS A DEPRESSING HOPELESSNESS BUT A NECESSARY STEP TO TAKE AWAY FROM MODERNISM WHILE THE AUTHORITY OF MODERNISM IS BROUGHT BACK AS JUST ONE OFTEN STERILE AND LIMITING BUT CULTURALLY CONVENTIONAL PATH TO THE TRUTH AS FOR WHAT TRUTH IS THAT'S FOR EACH PERSON TO DISCOVER FOR HIMSELF IT'S CLOSEST TO PAGANISM GOD PANTHEONS TAROT CARDS AND MULTIPLICITY OF MEANING BUT WITH AN EMPHASIS ON MEANING EXISTING ITS CHARACTERISTICS ARE TOUGHER TO SEE AS IT'S RARELY THE MAJORITY PHILOSOPHY OF ANY CULTURE BUT AUTHENTICITY INDIVIDUAL ASPIRATION FOLLOWING YOUR HEART OPENNESS TO ADVENTURE AND NEW EXPERIENCES COMFORT WITH LIMITED STRUCTURE ETC MAY BE RECOGNIZABLE ATTRIBUTES

SO AS YOU CAN SEE IS SOMEWHAT OF THE BLEND OF THE PREVIOUS TWO AND HARD TO DISTINGUISH THERE ARE THEORIES THAT SOCIETIES TEND TO CYCLE THROUGH EACH OF THESE AND THAT THE MULTIPLICITY OF MEANING TO MAY EVENTUALLY BE ENCOMPASSED INTO SOME NEW PHILOSOPHICAL STRUCTURE AND BECOME THE NEW MODERNISM POSITIVIST WHO THINK THE UNIVERSE CAN BE KNOWABLE AND OBJECTIVE ARE OFTEN MORE THAN HAPPY TO TRY AND ACCEPT THAT MULTIPLE SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE WORLD FIT INTO THEIR MODEL AND THUS AIM FOR THAT NEW MODERNISM OUT OF BUT I THINK THEY'D BE HARD-PRESSED TO EXPLAIN THE PRECISE POINT WHERE THEIR MODEL LEAVES THE CONSTRAINTS OF LANGUAGE AND DESCRIBES THE WORLD IN ITSELF IN SUCH SCENARIOS BUT I DIGRESS I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THESE ROUGH DEFINITIONS CHARACTERIZATIONS SO ANYONE INTERESTED IN THIS STUFF HAS A NICE POINT I THINK THESE THREE REPRESENT THE MAJOR STAGES OF OUR CULTURE OF ANY CULTURE I HAVE AN INTERESTING HEADCANON OF HOW TWITCHPLAYSPOKEMON WENT THROUGH THEM AND MAKE FOR USEFUL CONCEPTS TO PLAY WITH

THIS HILARY LAWSON GUY IS HILARIOUS IT'S DANGEROUS TO THINK THAT THIS THING THAT I THINK IS MY THUMB IS REALLY MY THUMB MY LIFE WOULD BE BETTER IF INSTEAD OF THINKING OF IT AS A THUMB I THOUGHT OF IT AS AN INFINITE LIST OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY GOD DAMN SENSE

AND ANYWAY IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY ESCAPING A BELIEF IN OBJECTIVE REALITY IT'S JUST SAYING THAT OBJECTIVE REALITY IS INFINITELY DESCRIBABLE AND THAT ONLY CHOOSING ONE WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS SOMEHOW WRONG BUT THAT'S STUPID NOBODY THINKS THAT WHEN THEY CALL THEIR THUMB A THUMB THEY'RE EXHAUSTIVELY DESCRIBING THE BEDROCK OBJECTIVE REALITY OF THAT THING CONNECTED TO THEIR HAND THUMB IS JUST THE MOST USEFUL WAY TO DESCRIBE THAT THING MOST OF THE TIME IT DOES NOT LIMIT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE THING THAT THE THUMB IS WE KNOW THAT IT'S ALSO MADE OF MOLECULES WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A MILLION OTHER USEFUL THINGS TO SAY ABOUT IT BUT MOST OF THE FUCKING TIME THE ONLY THING WE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT IS THAT IT'S A THUMB SO WE CALL IT THAT AND IT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY

IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIT OF A ARGUMENT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ANIMAL RIGHTS WE ARE TALKING PRIMARILY ABOUT ONE RIGHT THE RIGHT NOT TO BE PROPERTY NOTICE THE USE OF THE WORD PRIMARILY IT'S CLEAR TO ME AND PROBABLY TO HIM THAT THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT MOST PEOPLE REFER TO WHEN THEY SPEAK OF ANIMAL RIGHTS BECAUSE THAT WOULD LEAD TO HIS CONCLUSIONS

BUT WHO SAID THEY MUST BE PROPERTY OR THE SAME KIND OF PROPERTY THAT OTHER OBJECTS ARE THE CLEAREST ANSWER IS THAT WE SHOULD CREATE ANOTHER CATEGORY TO REFER TO SUPERVISION OVER OTHER ENTITIES OF MORAL SALIENCE

AS FOR ZOOS AND AQUARIA I GIVE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS SHORT MURMUR REPLYING TO GARY FRANCINE

IF SOME MONKEYS ARE KEEPING PETS SHOULD WE STOP THEM
LET'S CONSIDER THE AUTHORS THESIS AT FACE VALUE THE ONLY WAY TO RESPECT ANIMAL RIGHTS IS TO EXTINCT ALL ANIMALS

DOES THIS REALLY MAKE SENSE IS THIS REALLY WHAT ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS WANT CAN SOMETHING THAT CEASES TO EXIST HAVE RIGHTS

THE AUTHOR NEVER BRINGS UP EXTINCTION IN THE ARTICLE BUT IF HUMANS ARE NOT PROTECTING THEM IN ANY WAY AND HUMANS AND ANIMALS ARE COMPETING FOR RESOURCES AND SPACE WHERE ARE ALL THE ANIMALS GOING TO GO

THE AUTHOR DOES BRING UP THE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT KEEP BRINGING ANIMALS INTO EXISTENCE THOUGH WHICH SEEMS THAT THE AUTHOR IS IMPLYING THAT EXTINCTING ANIMALS IS MORALLY SUPERIOR TO ALLOWING THEM TO SUFFER

WHERE AM I MISINTERPRETING THIS ARTICLE AND IF I'M NOT WHY WOULD THE AUTHOR THINK THAT EXTINCTING ALL LIFE ON EARTH IS PREFERABLE TO THE ALTERNATIVE
SOME ANIMALS LOOKING AT YOU DOMESTICATED DOGS AND CATS CLEARLY ENJOY THE COMPANY OF HUMANS

OTHER THAN THAT IT IS ABOUT TIME WE START MOVING AWAY FROM FORCED OWNERSHIP OF OTHER CONSCIOUS BEINGS
I THINK THESE AUTHORS KNOW THAT AN ANIMAL'S RIGHT NOT TO BE PROPERTY IS NOT COMPELLING FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AUDIENCE SO THEY JUST KEEP SLIPPING UTILITARIAN CONSIDERATIONS IN THE BACK DOOR IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY A DEONTOLOGICAL PROJECT


I MAY NOT BE DESCRIBING MY CONCERN VERY WELL BUT DOES ANYONE ELSE GET THE SENSE THAT THIS IS A REALLY SNEAKY PAPER
THERE ARE A LOT OF FLAWS IN THE PREMISES HE BUILDS HIS ARGUMENTS ON THE REASONING BEHIND WHY PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE ENSLAVED AND PARTICULARLY HERE

THERE WERE MANY LAWS THAT PURPORTED TO REGULATE HUMAN SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN THESE LAWS DID NOT WORK BECAUSE THE ONLY TIMES REGULATORY LAWS ARE RELEVANT IS WHEN THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN SLAVE AND SLAVE OWNER AND IF THE SLAVE OWNER DOES NOT PREVAIL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE TIME THEN THERE IS NO LONGER AN INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY THERE CAN BE NO MEANINGFUL CHALLENGE TO THE EXERCISE OF THE OWNER S PROPERTY RIGHTS

THAT'S NOT WHY THE LAWS DIDN'T WORK IF IT WERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SLAVERY THROUGHOUT HUMAN HISTORY WOULD NOT HAVE EXISTED

IF THEY WERE NOT PETS DOGS WOULD NOT EXIST SHEEP WOULD NOT EXIST COWS WOULD EXIST ONLY IN INDIA THAT'S THE RESULT OF TRUE ANIMAL RIGHTS IF OTHER CREATURES COMPETE WITH HUMANS FOR HABITAT OR RESOURCES WE KILL THEM IF THEY HAVE A PURPOSE WE DO NOT
I AM COMPLETELY AGAINST KEEPING A HEALTHY WILD ANIMAL IN CAPTIVITY HOWEVER KEEP IN MIND MODERN DAY PET TYPE DOGS HAVE BEEN DOMESTICATED THROUGH UNNATURAL SELECTION THE CLAIM THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEHOW MORE MORAL TO SEND THEM TO THE WILD IS WRONG UNLESS YOU THINK A PUG OR A CHIHUAHUA HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT SURVIVAL AND HAPPINESS IN THE WOODS
ARGUES FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS AND AGAINST ANIMALS BEING PROPERTY YET STILL OWNS SIX DOGS

THIS KIND OF IDEOLOGICAL AND IMPRACTICAL POSITION LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WE SHOULD BETTER NUKE THE EARTH BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF SUFFERING AND RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ONCE AND FOR ALL
WHILE I THINK THE AUTHORS MEAN WELL I FIND IT A LITTLE DISGUSTING HOW CALMLY THEY ARE SUGGESTING THE ERADICATION OF SEVERAL SPECIES AS A MORAL NECESSITY IF ALIENS DECIDE THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER OUR EARTH HABITAT AND FACE THE MORAL DILEMMA OF KEEPING HUMANS AS PETS OR LETTING THE CURRENT GENERATIONS DIE OUT WHAT IS HUMANITIES CHOICE I'M SURE A GOOD PORTION OF PEOPLE WOULD CHOOSE TO BECOME PETS EVEN HUMAN SLAVERY IN ANCIENT TIMES WHEN SLAVES WERE OFTEN ACQUIRED DIRECTLY THROUGH CONQUEST SLAVES HAD A LIFE OR SLAVERY CHOICE AND MANY CHOSE SLAVERY DECIDING THAT SOME FORM OF EXISTENCE WAS SUPERIOR TO NOT EXISTING IF YOU ADVOCATE FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS SO MUCH HOW ABOUT CONSIDERING THE ANIMAL'S SELF INTEREST ARE YOU REALLY SO POMPOUS TO IMPOSE YOUR HUMAN MORALS OVER WHAT THE DOGS MIGHT WANT
THIS IS SLIPPERY LOGIC THAT EXTENDS TO HUMANS WE ARE FAR FROM A UTOPIA AND THE HARD TRUTH IS THAT NONE OF US EXIST BECAUSE WE CHOSE TO WE ARE ALL SENTENCED TO DIE MANY WHO WILL STARVE AND BE TORTURED DURING THAT TIME AND THE LUCKIER ONES LIVE TO WATCH THEIR BODY FALL APART YES WE CAN MAKE CHOICES BUT ONLY WITHIN THE SOCIETAL OWNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE SELF IMPOSED IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME LAWFUL GUARANTEES SOCIETY STILL TREATS YOU LIKE PROPERTY YOU CAN BE SENT TO FIGHT FOR THE SOCIETIES BENEFIT LIMITED IN YOUR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ONE CHILD POLICY TAKEN TO A SHELTER JAIL AND KILLED IF THAT IS WHAT SOCIETY DEMANDS AND YET HERE WE ARE HAPPY TO EXIST AND NOT MAKING CLAIMS THAT THE BEST MORALITY IS IF HUMANS DO NOT EXIST
THIS IS PRECISELY THE TYPE OF HYPER ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY THAT HAS DONE SO DAMAGE TO THE GENERAL APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PHILOSOPHY AS A WHOLE

THE EPITOME OF UTTER USELESSNESS
THIS ARGUMENT IS RATHER WEAK EVEN ASSUMING IT'S STRONGEST FORM IF WE ARE TO TAKE IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ONLY ETHICAL CONSIDERATION WE HAVE SOME VERY PROBLEMATIC ISSUES FIRSTLY THE ARTICLE SPEAKS OF SUFFERING AS IF IT IS A QUALIFIER FOR ETHICAL CONSIDERATION BUT WE CAN IMAGINE MANY EXAMPLES IN WHICH SUFFERING IS NOT NECESSARY FOR IMMORALITY IF I WERE TO KILL SOMEONE WITHOUT THEM SUFFERING PHYSICALLY OR EMOTIONALLY FROM IT IF I WERE TO CHEAT ON MY WIFE WITHOUT HER EVER KNOWING IT IF I WERE TO EUTHANIZE MY OWN CHILD WHO HAD A MENTAL DEFECT THAT DIDN'T ALLOW FOR SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS OR SELF-AWARENESS THESE ARE NOT GENERALLY CONSIDERED PERMISSIBLE ACTIONS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE AREN'T GIVING ETHICAL CONSIDERATION BECAUSE SOMETHING SUFFERS OR IN SOME CASES THE POSSIBILITY FOR THE VICTIM TO SUFFER WE ARE GIVING CONSIDERATION FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT THEY ARE HUMAN

TO ELABORATE A CHILD MAY BE BORN WITH SEVERE MENTAL DEFECT THAT CAUSES THE CHILD TO NEVER EXPERIENCE CONSCIOUSNESS SELF-AWARENESS OR ANY LEVEL OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION OUTSIDE OF THE PRIMITIVE BEHAVIORS OF THE WE WOULDN'T SAY THE CHILD IS UNDESERVING OF MORAL CONSIDERATION BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE MENTAL FACULTIES ENOUGH TO EXPERIENCING SUFFERING AS WE UNDERSTAND IT NEITHER IN THE CASE OF TERRY SCHIAVO DID SOCIETY EVER REJECT HER AS BEING UNWORTHY OF MORAL CONSIDERATION BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT SHE DIDN'T SEEM COGNISANT ENOUGH TO SUFFER INSOFAR AS SUFFERING IS AN EXTENSION OF PAIN AND REQUIRES HIGHER LEVEL MENTAL PROCESSES TO BE REALIZED QUITE THE OPPOSITE THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION WAS IN REGARDS TO WHAT COURSE OF ACTION WAS WITHIN THE REALM OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR IN MAKING A DECISION ABOUT HER LIFE GIVEN THE FACT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER CAPABLE OF DOING IT HERSELF TO TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF ABORTION SOME BELIEVE THAT A FERTILIZED EGG HAS A RIGHT TO LIFE SOME DON'T BY AN IMPLICATION OF ARGUMENT BUT THE DIALOGUE ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE EMBRYO IS TO BE GIVEN ETHICAL CONSIDERATION IT IS A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS ETHICAL WHEN CONSIDERATION OVERLAPS IN TWO MORAL AGENTS NOT UNLIKE SELF-DEFENCE IF A PERSON KILLS TO PROTECT THEIR OWN LIFE IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE STRIPPED OF MORAL CONSIDERATION OR THAT THE PERSON WHO TRIED TO TAKE THEIR LIFE FORFEITED THEIR MORAL CONSIDERATION EITHER

AT THIS POINT I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WHILE SUFFERING IS NOT A QUALIFIER FOR MORAL CONSIDERATION THE QUALITY OF SUFFERING IS INTIMATELY TIED TO MORAL JUDGEMENT WHEN IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT AN AGENT QUALIFIES FOR SAID CONSIDERATION THIS SUFFERING EXTENDS BEYOND PHYSICAL SUFFERING INTO MENTAL AS WELL IT'S A FIRMLY ESTABLISHED PRINCIPAL THAT THE INFLICTION OF MENTAL SUFFERING ON ANOTHER IS A MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE ACTION AND HEREIN I BELIEVE IS WHERE THE SUFFERING OF ANIMALS ENTERS WE CAN IMAGINE OR EVEN SAFELY ASSUME I THINK THAT AT SOME POINT OR SOME TIME IT HAPPENED THAT SOME GROUP OF PEOPLE WERE ELATED AT THE DEATH OF AN ANIMAL THAT IT MEANT SURVIVAL FOR THEM AND THE SUFFERING OF THE ANIMAL WAS OVERLOOKED AS EITHER NECESSARY OR IRRELEVANT CIVILIZATION HAS COME TO A POINT THOUGH IN WHICH THE KILLING OF ANIMALS IS LARGELY NECESSARY FOR THE SURVIVAL OF PEOPLE AND IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT THEIR IS NO MORE USE OR NEED OF MAKING IT A CELEBRATORY EVENT IT HAS COME TO PASS THAT NOW PEOPLE FEEL A CERTAIN DEGREE OF GUILT AT THE DEATH OF ANIMALS THAT WE FEEL SOME SORT OF SMALL INTERNAL SUFFERING AT BEARING WITNESS TO ANIMALS IN THEIR DEATH THROES AND PRIMITIVE CRIES THAT SO CLOSELY MIMIC THE CRIES OF PEOPLE IN PAIN AND PRECISELY BECAUSE OF IT WE HIDE AWAY THEIR SLAUGHTER BUT FOR SOME AN ADMIRABLE SOME I'D SAY IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO HIDE THESE THINGS AWAY AND THEY CHOOSE TO EXPOSE OTHERS AND THEMSELVES TO THIS HORRIBLE ACT AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE AFFLICTED WITH INTERNAL AND EMOTIONAL TURMOIL AT THE THINGS THEY SEE AND THE THINGS THEY KNOW TO BE HAPPENING IT IS FOR THIS REASON I BELIEVE THAT WE CONSIDER OUR BEHAVIOR TOWARDS ANIMALS AND POSSIBLY OUR OWN GUILT IN REGARDS TO OUR ACTIONS OR WHAT WE ARE A PARTY TO AS HAS BEEN SAID SOMEWHERE BEFORE OUR TREATMENT OF ANIMALS IS A REFLECTION OF AND PRACTICE IN OUR OWN HUMANITY THAT THE KILLING AND MISTREATMENT OF ANIMALS PROFOUNDLY UPSETS SOME PEOPLE AND THAT WE STRIVE SO EARNESTLY AND BUILD SOCIETIES ON THE PRINCIPAL THAT WHAT IS THE BEST IS WHAT DOES NOT CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER WHEN IT EXISTS THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO DO SO I WILL CONCLUDE FROM THIS ARGUMENT THOUGH THAT WHILE THE MISTREATMENT AND SUFFERING OF ANIMALS AT THAT HANDS OF HUMANS CAN BE SAID TO ENCROACH ON IMMORALITY BECAUSE OF IT BEING AN UNNECESSARY ACTION THAT CREATES INTERNAL TURMOIL FOR SOME PEOPLE THE KEEPING OF ANIMALS AS PETS OR COMPANIONS PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE CARED FOR AND WELL TREATED IS NOT AN IMMORAL ACT

LASTLY IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD GIVE ANIMALS MORAL CONSIDERATION BUT I SIMPLY DON'T THINK WE CAN LOGICALLY AND REASONABLY REACH THAT POSITION FROM THE PREMISE OF ANIMALS SUFFERING I THINK IT'S WORTH FURTHER EXAMINING WHY HUMANS ARE AFFORDED WHAT SEEMS TO BE BLANKET MORAL CONSIDERATION BASED ON NOTHING OTHER THAN THEIR
A MORAL JUST WORLD WOULD HAVE NO LIFE FOR THAT IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL
SO AN ANIMAL THAT IS EVOLVED TO BE AROUND HUMANS WOULD BE FREE IF IT WERE FORCED TO LIVE IN THE WILD
I'D ARGUE THAT THAT WOULD BE QUITE UNMORAL WHY WOULD YOU KNOWINGLY LEAVE THESE ANIMALS TO SUFFER IN THE WILDERNESS EVEN IF IT'S THEIR NATURAL HABITAT AND APART FROM THE SUFFERING IT SEEMS THAT SOME ANIMALS LEGITIMATELY ENJOY BEING UNDER HUMAN CONTROL
ANIMALS LACK MORAL AGENCY WE HAVE TO TAKE AT LEAST SOME ACTION AGAINST THEM BECAUSE WE CAN'T REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM AS WE CAN WITH OTHER PEOPLE

AS FOR PETS I THINK THE WAY WE TREAT THEM LINES UP WELL WITH HOW WE TREAT HUMANS WHO LACK THE MENTAL CAPACITY FOR MORAL AGENCY IN MANY CASES BETTER BECAUSE WE LET A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE ROAM THE STREETS HOMELESS WE FEED THEM AND SHELTER THEM WHILE MAKING DECISIONS FOR THEM IF THEIR BEHAVIOR IS A PROBLEM WE DO RESTRICT THEIR FREEDOM

AS FOR EATING WE DO WHAT WE MUST WE WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE WITH OUR MENTAL CAPACITY FOR MORAL AGENCY IF WE HADN'T ADOPTED THE PRACTICE OF EATING MEAT ESPECIALLY COOKED MEAT WHICH GAVE US THE CALORIES AND NUTRIENTS NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN LARGE BRAINS WITHOUT EXCESSIVE TIME SPENT ON DIGESTION
MY DOGS ARE AND HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PART OF MY FAMILY WHILE I AGREE THAT EXOTIC ANIMALS SHOULDN'T BE KEPT AS PETS I WILL NEVER GIVE UP MY DOGS NOW OR IN THE FUTURE I CANNOT IMAGINE ANY PART OF MY LIFE WITHOUT MY K9 COMPANIONS
THE AUTHORS HAVE NOT DONE A GOOD JOB OF ARGUING FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF ANIMAL FREEDOM QUA ANIMAL FREEDOM INSTEAD THEY SHOWCASE HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE CONTINGENT RATHER THAN ESSENTIAL TO PET OWNERSHIP THEY DO THIS DESPITE THEIR DISAVOWAL OF CONSEQUENTIALISM I THINK THEY TAKE THIS APPROACH BECAUSE IT'S QUITE CLEAR TO THE AUDIENCE THAT MERE FREEDOM SLAVERY ISN'T IMPORTANT TO ANIMALS


A MIND NEEDS TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION IN ORDER TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A LACK OF FREEDOM QUA LACK OF FREEDOM A CLAM FOR EXAMPLE IS PERFECTLY INSENSITIVE TO WHETHER OR NOT HE IS OWNED


MY IMPULSE IS TO GROUP DOGS AND CLAMS TOGETHER I THINK THAT GOOD TREATMENT OF A DOG OR CLAM IS SUMMARIZABLE ENTIRE IN TERMS OF COMFORT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN INSULT THE CANINE SPIRIT IN THE WAY THAT YOU CAN INSULT THE HUMAN SPIRIT SLAVERY QUA SLAVERY ONLY HURTS CREATURES THAT ARE CAPABLE IF BEING DISRESPECTED IN CERTAIN WAYS


I THINK OF DEONTOLOGICAL MORAL FACTS AS BEING LIKE RADIO WAVES THEY USUALLY ONLY AFFECT THINGS THAT HAVE ANTENNAE THE HUMAN MIND IS SUCH AN ANTENNAE BUT DOG MINDS AREN'T OR AT LEAST THEY ARE TUNED TO A NARROWER RANGE OF MORAL FACTS THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM IS JUST OUTSIDE OF THEIR FREQUENCY RANGE
WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE LIKE SINGER AND FRANCINE COMPLETELY IGNORE HOW ANIMALS NORMALLY FUNCTION THE ANIMAL WORLD IS ONE OF TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE VIOLENCE CONSTANTLY KILLING AND EATING EACH OTHER ARE HUMAN BEINGS NOT ANIMALS WHY ARE WE HELD TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD THAN ALL OTHER ANIMALS THEY OFTEN ARGUE AGAINST SEPARATING THE HUMAN RACE FROM THE REST OF NATURE YET ISNT THAT EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING
DO WE ARREST THE ANIMAL CARNIVORES WHEN THEY IMPINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF OTHER ANIMALS
NO CARNIVORES OR HERBIVORES

NO PARASITES

NO PATHOGENS

SOUNDS HEAVENLY
NO CARNIVORES NO ANTS NO NATURE NO EXISTENCE BLAH BLAH BLAH
I JUST WANNA KILL STUFF AND EAT IT ONE PER DAY
SO IN A MORALLY JUST WORLD THE CAT THAT SHOWED UP IN MY YARD ONE DAY AND CHOSE TO LIVE THERE WOULD BE WRONG
SAYS WHO WHO DECIDES WHAT IS MORALLY JUST IN THIS LIFE WHO IS THE AUTHORITY THAT WE MAY ALL ACKNOWLEDGE AS OUR SOURCE OF MORALITY OTHERWISE THIS STATEMENT IS NOTHING MORE THAN ONE MAN'S OPINION
SO THEN CLARIFY AND SAY TROPHY HUNTING WHEN YOU SAY HUNTING THATS NOT VERY DESCRIPTIVE
IF I LOOK AT THE ORIGINS OF MORALLY JUST

I FOUND FIRST IT WAS A DEMAND TO BE OBEDIENT TO A GOD S

THEN IT WAS DEFINED AS RELIGIOUS SIN

THEN IT WAS SECULARIZED INTO MORALITY

BUT ALL THOSE IDEAS ARE FROM MEN IMPOSING THEIR WILL ON OTHER MEN NOT NATURE IMPOSING ITSELF ON MEN

SO I FIRST LOOK AT THE ORIGINS OF THE IDEA AND THE PURPOSE THE IDEA IS MEANT TO SERVE AND I REMEMBER

STRONG BELIEFS ARE TAUGHT NOT A NATURAL PROGRESSION OF INTELLECTUAL GROWTH AND MATURITY

FOR THAT I RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL DRIVE FOR SURVIVAL AND PERPETUATION OF THE HUMAN PORTION OF THE ONE THING

THAT DOES NOT MEAN THESE IDEAS ARE ALWAYS BAD AND LIMITING BUT I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION AND ADJUSTING ALONG WITH OUR INCREASED KNOWLEDGE AND AWARENESS JUST AS WE HAVE DONE TO ARRIVE AT THIS WORD MORAL

THE THING I WOULD CONSIDER IMMORAL IS CRUELTY AND ABUSE TO OUR WORK AND FOOD ANIMALS

I WAS BORN ON A SUSTAINABLE KIND OF MIXED FARM WHERE MY PARENTS HAD A FEW CASH CROPS AND RAISED AND GREW MOST OF THE FOOD WE CONSUMED

I DON'T THINK IT WAS IMMORAL TO EAT THAT CHICKEN WE RAISED OR TO SELL MOST OF THE LIVESTOCK TO SOMEONE ELSE FOR FOOD AND THE FAMILY INCOME

IF WE HAD NO COMPANION ANIMALS WOULD THERE STILL BE HORSES AFTER ALL THEY ARE NOT NEEDED FOR WORK SO MUCH AND THERE AREN'T MANY IN THE WILD NOR MANY WILD PLACES FOR THEM

I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO CONTINUE TO BEFRIEND AND KEEP AND PROTECT AS MUCH OF OUR ANIMAL AS POSSIBLE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE ADN CONTINUE TO DO SO AND THAT OUR ZOOS ARE NOW MORE FOR PRESERVATION THAN EXHIBITION
BUT THAT EXHIBITION IS IMPORTANT TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR KEEP PROTECTING AND PRESERVING THEM

HERE IS ONE THING THAT WHEN I LEARNED OF IT CAUSED MY ENTIRE REEXAMINATION OF WHAT IS MORAL

IN TRADITIONAL JAPANESE BELIEFS IT IS IMMORAL TO BE DISOBEDIENT TO YOUR SUPERIORS BE IT PARENT OR RELIGION OR EMPLOYER OR GOVERNMENT THAT WAS COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO ALL I HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY MY PARENTS AND THAT WAS TO ALWAYS QUESTION AUTHORITY OF MEN OVER MEN AND CHALLENGE IT WHEN NECESSARY TO SURVIVE

SOME REARRANGING AND ADDITION

HE TREATS HIS ARGUMENT FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS AS IF IT IS OBJECTIVE WHEN NO AXIOM EXISTS TO DEFEND HIS CLAIM ANIMAL RIGHTS ARE SENTIMENTAL AND BASED PURELY ON EMOTION
I EXPECT BETTER FROM AEON
SO WE NEED TO DESTROY ALL DOMESTICATED ANIMALS TO ELIMINATE THEIR SPECIES FUTURE NEED OF GUARDIANSHIP

WHO WANTS TO BE THE DESIGNATED PET EXTERMINATOR
THIS IS TOO FAR FETCHED DOGS AND CATS LOVE HUMANS I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF NO BARNS WITH COWS HOWEVER IN MY COUNTRY THERE'S ONLY FLAT LAND WITH COWS AND FARMERS I DON'T GET IT IF WE ALL STOPPED CONSUMING COW PRODUCTS WHAT'S THE FUCKING PROBLEM WE COULD DO SO MUCH AMAZING THINGS WITH ALL THE LAND THAT'S LEFT
A MORALLY JUST WORLD BUT ALSO ONE THAT'S ON THE BRINK OF HUNGER

FAFFY
A MORALLY JUST WORLD WOULD HAVE NO HUMANS IN IT

BUT IF WE TAKE THIS DOWN A NOTCH OR TWO I WOULD AGREE THAT ZOOS ARE CURRENTLY INHERENTLY BAD FOR SOCIETY ZOOS COULD BE POSSIBLE AND WITH TECHNOLOGY WE COULD HAVE ZOOS WITH LARGE HDTV DISPLAYS WHERE THE CAMERAS ARE POSITIONED IN A REAL WILDLIFE PRESERVE WHERE ONLY ANIMALS HUNT AND PLAY AND ACTIVITIES OF THE ANIMALS WOULD BE BROADCAST TO THE ZOO AT ANY TIME THEY WANTED

THIS WOULD BE MUCH MORE EXCITING AS YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN FROM DAY TO DAY AND I WOULD IMAGINE ZOO PARTICIPATION WOULD INCREASE

ENTERTAINMENT FOR HUMANS BUT NO INSANE CAGING OF ANIMALS EITHER

GARY L FRANCINE NEEDS TO REALIZE THERE ARE SOLUTIONS OTHER THAN OUTRIGHT BANNING SOMETHING SEEMINGLY THINKING THIS WOULD SUDDENLY TIP THE WORLD BACK INTO MORALITY EQUIVALENCY MODE
OK SO IN THAT STUPID WORLD BE PREPARED TO SAY GOODBYE TO A WHOLE LOT OF SPECIES AS A PARENT OF ANYTHING IT IS MORALLY UNJUST TO BRING A CERTAIN LIFE INTO THIS WORLD AND AFTER ITS BORN TO FORSAKE IT AND IGNORE IT THATS WHAT REPUBLICANS DO

SO SAY GOODBYE TO COWS CHICKENS AND HOGS TO NAME JUST A FEW COMMON ANIMAL GROUPS BUT ALSO SAY GOODBYE TO RHINOS ELEPHANTS WHALES DOLPHINS TIGERS LIONS LEOPARDS JAGUARS ORANGUTANS AND PROBABLY ANYTHING ELSE THAT WILL BE HUNTED TO EXTINCTION IN THE WILD
ASSUMING ANIMALS CARE WHETHER THEY ARE OWNED BY SOMEONE OR NOT

WHICH THEY ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT CARE LESS ABOUT
HE SAYS THAT ZOOS AND AQUARIUMS THE PLACE WHERE ENDANGERED ANIMALS ARE BROUGHT BACK FROM THE BRINK THE PLACE ANIMALS ARE CARED FOR AND THE PLACE CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT ANIMALS IS UNJUST BUT DOES NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT HUNTING
I AM NOT SAYING HUNTING IS GOOD OR BAD BUT I THINK IT IS WORSE THAN A ZOO
I DON'T CARE ABOUT CATTLE HONESTLY I DON'T CARE ABOUT PETS EITHER BUT I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD STOP KIDDING THEMSELVES YOUR PET IS NOT YOUR FRIEND YOUR PET IS A SLAVE
YOUR ASSERTION OF FACULTY OF DISTINGUISHMENT BEING REQUIRED FOR RATIONAL DECISIONS IS THE CRUX OF YOUR ENTIRE ARGUMENT IT IS IMO AN OBSERVATIONALLY FALSE ASSERTION ALL CURRENT STATES OF KNOWLEDGEABLE FROM WHICH DECISIONS ARE MADE CONTAIN MAJORITY OF NOT ULTIMATELY ONLY OF CONDITIONS WHICH THE DECIDING AGENT HAS NO CONTROL OVER MAKING ANY PRACTICAL DECISION IN THE REAL WORLD INHERENTLY IRRATIONAL BECAUSE THE OUTCOME OF ANY ACTION IN THE LONG TERM IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE

THIS MAKES ALL SUCH DECISIONS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE AND PRECLUDES OBJECTIVITY OR BRUT RATIONAL DECISIONS FROM EVER OCCURRING

THE ONLY WAY I SEE TO INVALIDATE THAT OPINION IS BY AN APRIORI ASSUMPTION INCONSISTENT WITH OBSERVATIONAL REALITY
IS IT POSSIBLE TO BOIL DOWN UR ASSERTION TO A FEW SENTENCES THANKS
FACULTY OF DISTINGUISHMENT HAS A FEW PROBLEMS ACCORDING TO YOUR DEFINITIONS HERE FOD IS THE ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE OUTCOMES YOU ALSO PRESUME THAT ALL PERSONS HAVE THE SAME ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE OUTCOMES

COUNTEREXAMPLES
ACCUMULATION OF KNOWLEDGE OVER THE CENTURIES THE ALCHEMISTS OF THE MIDDLE AGES CERTAINLY THOUGHT TRANSMUTING LEAD INTO GOLD WAS POSSIBLE CURRENTLY WE KNOW THIS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS YOU WANT RADIOACTIVE GOLD ONE OF THESE GROUPS OF PEOPLE MUST BE INCORRECT

ACCESS TO LIMITED KNOWLEDGE
CERTAIN INFORMATION IS ONLY KNOWN TO A PRIVILEGED FEW DURING WW2 TRUMAN AND THE ALLIES HAD REASON TO BELIEVE THE ATOMIC BOMB WAS POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT EVEN AFTER HIROSHIMA THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN WAS NOT WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT A WEAPON THAT POWERFUL COULD BE CONSTRUCTED HENCE THE BOMBING OF NAGASAKI

PERSONAL EXPERIENCES
BEFORE CARL LEWIS IT WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT NO MAN WOULD BREAK THE TEN SECOND BARRIER

DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS TO INFORMATION HISTORICAL ACCUMULATION NATIONAL SECRETS PERSONAL INFORMATION EDUCATION ETC LEAD TO PERFECTLY RATIONAL AGENTS COMING TO DIFFERING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY IMPOSSIBILITY OF CERTAIN OUTCOMES

THEREFORE IT CAN BE LOGICAL FOR SOMEONE WITH IMPROVED ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR PERSONS WITH LESS KNOWLEDGE THE MOST COMMON EXAMPLES INCLUDE PARENTING TEACHING TUTORING OR MENTORING

TO BE EVEN MORE EXPLICIT I AM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IF I DEVELOP A TUMOR I WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER OR NOT ITS MALIGNANT IF I GO TO A TRUSTED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TELL ME BENIGN MALIGNANT TREATABLE UNTREATABLE
WAS THERE A POINT TO THIS ARTICLE THE AUTHORS BASICALLY WENT AROUND DESCRIBING VARIOUS MORAL THEORIES AS THEY APPLIED TO ANIMALS AND THEN GAVE A ONE LINER ABOUT HOW HE DIDN'T LIKE THEM THE AUTHOR LITERALLY GIVES NO DEFENSE TO WHY UTILITARIANISM IS INCORRECT IN THIS INSTANCE OTHER THAN A LINE ABOUT OVERFEEDING A HOMELESS PERSON WHICH ISN'T EVEN INCORRECT SEE THE ENTIRE EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM MOVEMENT THE ARTICLE PRESENTED NO ARGUMENTS AND DIDN'T EVEN END ON A SUGGESTED MORAL THEORY OR A SUGGESTED TAKE AWAY MESSAGE OTHER THAN WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE THINGS DIE
I QUITE LIKED THIS ARTICLE IN THE END THOUGH SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS ARE A BIT POINTLESS REALLY THE ARGUMENT OF WHETHER WE SHOULD EAT HIGHER ANIMALS HAS BEEN DECIDED IT IS BAD FOR THE ANIMALS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO BAD FOR OUR HEALTH I SUPPOSE THE QUESTION OF EATING INSECTS IS DIFFERENT SINCE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO EAT ANIMALS AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THEM TO EAT LESS
IT'S AN INTERESTING IF CIRCULAR PIECE AND THE BEST THAT WE CAN REASONABLY EXPECT WHEN DISCUSSING ANY ETHICAL PROBLEM IS DISCUSSION AND NOT A DEFINITIVE ANSWER BAGGING TOUCHES ON THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF ALL ETHICS IF OTHER LIVING BEINGS EXPERIENCE PAIN AS WE KNOW THEY DO WHY DO WE TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY THAN WE WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED OURSELVES YEARS OF PHILOSOPHY HAVE NOT PROVIDED A SOLUTION TO THIS DILEMMA NOT ONE THAT WE'RE ALL HAPPY WITH AT LEAST
DELETED
TR YOUTUBE CHANNEL HAS A LOT OF POTENTIAL AND BOTH OF HIS VIDEOS ARE INTERESTING
NICE STORY BUT IT SEEMS TO MAINLY MISREPRESENT THE VERITASIUM VIDEO IN WHICH HE WANT TO STOP READING CLICKBAIT ARTICLES AND BEING STUCK TO HIS PHONE TO LET HIS MIND WANDER OR DO THINGS THAT MATTER MORE TO HIM THE SHORT CUTS SECONDS ARE A TELLING SIGN

SEE FOR YOURSELF

WATCH V IYYUIWP
ALMOST OF WHAT I'D READ OR WATCH ONLINE I NEVER DISCUSSED WITH A PERSON IN REAL LIFE I WENT FROM CONSUMING A TON TO IGNORING EVERYTHING AT THE TIME I WAS MEETING A LOT OF NEW PEOPLE SO I WAS DISTRACTED BY THE NOVELTY OF IT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WERE TRAVELLING SO EVERYONE WAS IN AN ADVENTURE EXPLORATION MODE BUT A LOT OF IT CAME DOWN TO DRINKING ALCOHOL

IN GENERAL IF YOU PUT MORE EFFORT INTO ENGAGING IN THE MOMENT BEING EXPRESSIVE BEING FUNNY TAKING IMPROV CLASSES TAKING TOASTMASTERS CLASSES AND BEING A SOURCE OF FUN THEN LIFE SEEMS TO OPEN UP MORE

DISTRACTING YOURSELF WITH NOTIONS OF READING TECH NEWS OR GLOBAL EVENTS TO BE INFORMED OR OF FALLING INTO A TRAP THAT YOU SHOULD WATCH TV MOVIES VIDEO GAMES IS A DANGEROUS THING

I AM BACK TO MEANINGLESS DISTRACTIONS PODCASTS ETC AND CONVINCING MYSELF OF THEIR VALUE BUT I TRY TO REPLACE THEM WITH MEANINGFUL DISTRACTIONS LIKE LEARNING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE OR HOW TO DANCE WELL THINGS THAT WILL ALLOW ME TO ENGAGE IN THE INTERPERSONAL MOMENTS WITH OTHERS IN A MORE PROFOUND AND POWERFUL WAY

IT'S CERTAINLY NOT EASY BUT I KEEP REMINDING MYSELF THAT BAD DISTRACTIONS ARE THE PATH TO A DIMINISHED LIFE
WHOA NOW IT WAS PRETTY APPARENT IN VIDEO THAT HE WAS FULLY AWARE OF THE CONTRADICTION OF BOTH VALUING DISTRACTION AND SEEING THE DOWNSIDES IF HE REALLY IS UNAWARE OF HIS UNDERLYING IDEOLOGY THEN THIS DISTRACTION ECONOMY VIDEO WAS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT

I DON'T SEE HOW FINDING A BALANCE BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD DISTRACTIONS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH POINT ABOUT DANGER-FREE INDULGENCES

CONCLUSION I'M CONFUSED I DIDN'T GET THE IMPRESSION THAT VERITASIUM IS CUTTING OUT ALL NEWS WORLD EVENTS ETC FROM HIS LIFE HE PROBABLY COULDN'T DO IT IF HE TRIED I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO POINT OUT THE FINE LINE BETWEEN INGESTING TOO MUCH INFORMATION AND AVOIDING INFORMATION TO THE POINT YOU ACTUALLY MISS OUT ON SOME UNEXPECTED INSPIRATION WHICH COULD BENEFIT YOU YOUR FRIENDS FAMILY OR THE WORLD

POINTS ABOUT POSSIBILITY IMPOSSIBILITY ARE SOME OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THEY APPLY TO VERITASIUM I NEVER GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT VERITASIUM SUBSCRIBED TO WHAT ZIZEL IS AFRAID OF THAT TECHNOLOGY GIVES US INFINITE POTENTIAL IN THE PERSONAL REALM BUT RAISING TAXES 2 ON CAPITAL GAINS TO HOUSE AND FEED THE HOMELESS IS CONSIDERED UNREALISTIC UTOPIAN FANTASY
INTRO

WORK IN LOGIC AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS CENTERS ON
CLAIMS OF LOGICAL ENTAILMENT MOST IMPORTANT AMONGST THESE IS THE CLAIM THAT
ARITHMETICAL TRUTHS ARE ENTAILED BY PURELY LOGICAL PRINCIPLES OCCUPYING A LESS
CENTRAL BUT NONETHELESS IMPORTANT ROLE IN WORK ARE CLAIMS ABOUT
FAILURES OF ENTAILMENT HERE THE CLEAREST EXAMPLES ARE HIS THESES THAT THE
TRUTHS OF GEOMETRY ARE NOT ENTAILED BY THE TRUTHS OF LOGIC OR OF ARITHMETIC AND
THAT SOME OF THEM ARE NOT ENTAILED BY EACH OTHER AS HE AND WE WOULD PUT IT
THE TRUTHS OF EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE TRUTHS OF LOGIC AND
SOME OF THEM ARE INDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER

TALK OF INDEPENDENCE AND RELATED NOTIONS SOUNDS FAMILIAR TO A
MODERN EAR A PROPOSITION IS INDEPENDENT OF A COLLECTION OF PROPOSITIONS JUST IN
CASE IT ISN'T A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT COLLECTION AND A PROPOSITION OR COLLECTION OF
PROPOSITIONS IS CONSISTENT JUST IN CASE NO CONTRADICTION IS A CONSEQUENCE OF IT
BUT SOME OF VIEWS AND PROCEDURES ARE DECIDEDLY DESPITE
DEVELOPING AN EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED APPARATUS FOR DEMONSTRATING THAT ONE
CLAIM IS A CONSEQUENCE OF OTHERS FREGE OFFERS NOT A SINGLE DEMONSTRATION THAT
ONE CLAIM IS NOT A CONSEQUENCE OF OTHERS THUS IN PARTICULAR HE GIVES NO
PROOFS OF INDEPENDENCE OR OF CONSISTENCY THIS IS NO ACCIDENT DESPITE HIS FIRM
COMMITMENT TO THE INDEPENDENCE AND CONSISTENCY CLAIMS JUST MENTIONED FREGE
HOLDS THAT INDEPENDENCE AND CONSISTENCY CANNOT SYSTEMATICALLY BE
DEMONSTRATED

VIEW HERE IS PARTICULARLY STRIKING IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT HIS
CONTEMPORARIES HAD A FRUITFUL AND SYSTEMATIC METHOD FOR PROVING CONSISTENCY
AND INDEPENDENCE A METHOD WHICH WAS WELL KNOWN TO HIM ONE OF THE CLEAREST
APPLICATIONS OF THIS METHOD IN DAY CAME IN FOUNDATIONS
OF GEOMETRY IN WHICH HILBERT ESTABLISHES VIA ESSENTIALLY OUR OWN MODERN
METHOD THE CONSISTENCY AND INDEPENDENCE OF VARIOUS AXIOMS AND AXIOM SYSTEMS
FOR EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY REACTION TO WORK WAS THAT IT WAS SIMPLY A FAILURE THAT ITS CENTRAL METHODS WERE INCAPABLE OF DEMONSTRATING
CONSISTENCY AND INDEPENDENCE AND THAT ITS USEFULNESS IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF
MATHEMATICS WAS HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE REGARDING THE GENERAL USEFULNESS OF
THE METHOD IT IS CLEAR THAT FREGE WAS WRONG THE LAST YEARS OF WORK IN LOGIC
AND MATHEMATICS GIVES AMPLE EVIDENCE OF THE FRUITFULNESS OF THOSE TECHNIQUES
WHICH GROW DIRECTLY FROM THE APPROACH THE STANDARD VIEW TODAY
IS THAT FREGE WAS ALSO WRONG IN HIS CLAIM THAT METHODS FAIL TO
DEMONSTRATE CONSISTENCY AND INDEPENDENCE THE VIEW WOULD SEEM TO BE THAT
FREGE LARGELY MISSED POINT AND THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF
TECHNIQUES WOULD HAVE REVEALED TO FREGE THEIR SUCCESS DESPITE
HISTORIC ROLE AS THE FOUNDER OF THE METHODS WE NOW USE TO DEMONSTRATE
POSITIVE HE SIMPLY FAILED ON THIS ACCOUNT TO UNDERSTAND
THE WAYS IN WHICH METHODS COULD BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE NEGATIVE


THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO QUESTION THIS ACCOUNT OF THE
DISAGREEMENT BY FREGE HAD A WELL-DEVELOPED VIEW OF LOGICAL
CONSEQUENCE CONSISTENCY AND INDEPENDENCE A VIEW WHICH WAS CENTRAL TO HIS
FOUNDATIONAL WORK IN ARITHMETIC AND TO THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF
THAT WORK GIVEN THIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOGICAL RELATIONS I SHALL ARGUE
DEMONSTRATIONS DO FAIL SUCCESSFUL AS THEY WERE IN DEMONSTRATING
SIGNIFICANT METATHEORETIC RESULTS PROOFS DO NOT ESTABLISH THE
CONSISTENCY AND INDEPENDENCE IN SENSE OF GEOMETRICAL AXIOMS THIS
POINT IS IMPORTANT I THINK BOTH FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIS OF
EPISTEMOLOGICAL CLAIMS ABOUT MATHEMATICS AND FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF JUST
HOW DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF LOGIC IS FROM THE MODERN
CONCEPTION WHICH HAS GROWN OUT OF THE APPROACH TO CONSISTENCY

AUTHOR

PATRICIA BLANCHETTE PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME
IF I COULD ASK A SECOND QUESTION THAT RECEIVED A LOT OF ATTENTION ON THIS SUBREDDIT IN A RECENT ARTICLE DANIEL DENNETT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID THAT

A GREAT DEAL OF PHILOSOPHY DOESN T REALLY DESERVE MUCH OF A PLACE OF THE WORLD HE SAYS PHILOSOPHY IN SOME QUARTERS HAS BECOME SELF-INDULGENT CLEVER PLAY IN A VACUUM THAT S NOT DEALING OF PROBLEMS OF ANY INTRINSIC INTEREST

MUCH IF NOT ALL PHILOSOPHICAL WORK IN ANALYTIC METAPHYSICS FOR EXAMPLE IS WILLFULLY CUT OFF FROM ANY SERIOUS ISSUES SAYS DENNETT THE PROBLEM HE EXPLAINS IS THAT CLEVER STUDENTS LOOKING TO SHOW OFF THEIR SKILLS CONCOCT CUTE COUNTERARGUMENT THAT REQUIRE NEITHER TECHNICAL TRAINING NOR EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE THESE THEN BUILD OFF EACH OTHER AND INVADE THE JOURNALS AND PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE

NOW YOUR WORK IS NOTABLE FOR BEING APPROACHABLE AND DEALING WITH SYSTEMATIC ISSUES IN PHILOSOPHY OF THESE TWO CHARACTERISTICS WHICH DO YOU FEEL CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY ON THE WHOLE MOST LACKS APPROACHABLE LANGUAGE OR A LARGER APPROACH TO BROADER ISSUES
FROM THE ANNOUNCEMENT PAGE

NATANT POINTS DAYS AGO
HI KEVIN I TRIED TO READ YOUR BOOK REPLACING TRUTH A WHILE BACK BUT IT WAS A LITTLE HEAVY FOR ME AT THE TIME SO I WAS UNABLE TO FINISH NONETHELESS I FIND YOUR WORK VERY INTERESTING AND I HOPE TO RETURN TO THE BOOK SOMEDAY

ONE OF THE MOST VEXING PROBLEMS FOR ME HAS BEEN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER LOGIC CAN BE RATIONALLY REVISED CLEARLY YOUR PROJECT IS REVISIONIST SO I HAVE TO ASK HOW DO YOU APPROACH THIS QUESTION OF RATIONAL REVISION


KS

I M SORRY THE BOOK ISN T MORE ACCESSIBLE I WROTE IT ORIGINALLY TO BE READ BY A WIDE AUDIENCE BUT THE PRESS ASKED ME TO CUT IT IN HALF SO I HAD TO CUT OUT ALL THE ACCESSIBLE STUFF NOW IT S MOSTLY FOR EXPERTS I M CONVERTING ALL THAT INTRODUCTORY MATERIAL INTO AN ACCESSIBLE BOOK ON TRUTH THAT S UNDER CONTRACT AND MOSTLY DONE

YES THE TOPIC OF RATIONALLY REVISING ANY PART OF OUR CONCEPTUAL SCHEME INCLUDING LOGIC IS A MAJOR THEME OF MY WORK I ADVOCATE CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING AS A PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY WHICH SAYS THAT GOOD PHILOSOPHICAL WORK IS NOT ONLY DESCRIPTIVE LIKE CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS BUT PRESCRIPTIVE AS WELL WESTERN PHILOSOPHY HAS FOR A LONG TIME BEEN SOMEWHAT PRESCRIPTIVE BECAUSE IT HAS ADVOCATED REVISING OUR BELIEFS I THINK THAT S A CENTRAL MESSAGE OF PLATO S APOLOGY HOWEVER I THINK IT SHOULD ALSO TELL US HOW TO IMPROVE OUR WAYS OF REPRESENTING THE WORLD LIKE OUR CONCEPTS NOT JUST OUR BELIEFS ABOUT THE WORLD

HOWEVER WE WANT OUR PRESCRIPTIONS TO BE GOOD ONES AND ONE IMPORTANT STANDARD HERE IS RATIONALITY WE SHOULD REVISE OUR CONCEPTUAL SCHEME IN WAYS THAT MAKE SENSE I EAST THAT ARE RATIONAL OR THE MOST RATIONAL IF YOU THINK RATIONALITY COMES IN DEGREES ONCE WE START TRYING TO REVISE WHAT IS RATIONAL OR HOW RATIONAL VARIOUS THINGS ARE WE RUN INTO TROUBLE SHOULD THE REVISIONS BE RATIONAL IN THE OLD SENSE OR IN THE NEW SENSE OFTEN THE OLD SENSES OF RATIONALITY DON T ALLOW THE RECOMMENDED CHANGES SO THE FORMER ANSWER THE OLD SENSE OF RATIONALITY IS TOO CONSERVATIVE HOWEVER ONE CAN COME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF UNACCEPTABLE NEW WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT RATIONALITY THAT DO JUSTIFY THEMSELVES SO THE LATTER ANSWER THE NEW SENSE OF RATIONALITY IS TOO LIBERAL A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM IS THE WORK TONK WHICH FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS HAS BEEN KNOWN AS A SORT OF JOKE LOGICAL WORD TONK IS KIND OF LIKE CONJUNCTION AND AND KIND OF LIKE DISJUNCTION OR IF IT S LIKE DISJUNCTION BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE SOME SENTENCE P THEN YOU CAN ALWAYS INFER P TONK Q FOR ANY OTHER SENTENCE QUEEN IT S LIKE CONJUNCTION BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE SOME SENTENCE P TONK Q THEN YOU CAN ALWAYS INFER QUEEN NOW LOOK WHAT HAPPENS IF WE ADD TONK TO OUR LANGUAGE WE CAN REASON VALIDLY FROM ANY SENTENCE P TO ANY OTHER SENTENCE QUEEN WE CAN REASON VALIDLY FROM I M KEVIN TO I M A BILLIONAIRE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT A RATIONAL REVISION OF OUR LOGIC SINCE IT DESTROYS OUR LOGIC I EAST MAKES IT TRIVIAL SO THAT EVERY REASONING IS VALID HOWEVER IT IS EASY TO ARGUE USING TONK THAT ONE SHOULD MAKE THIS REVISION THAT IS PICK ANY SENTENCE AT ALL HOW ABOUT I M IN SCOTLAND AND USING TONK ONE CAN VALIDLY REASON TO THE SENTENCE WE SHOULD ADD TONK IN OUR LANGUAGE THE PROBLEM IS TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY OF CHARACTERIZING WHICH CHANGES ARE RATIONAL AND WHICH AREN T EVEN WHEN WE RE DEALING WITH THE VERY CONCEPT OF RATIONALITY IN THE CASE OF LOGIC THERE ARE ENDLESS DEBATES ABOUT WHETHER INTUITIONIST LOGICIANS CAN JUSTIFY INTUITIONISTIC LOGIC OR WHETHER PARACONSISTENT LOGICIANS CAN JUSTIFY PARACONSISTENT LOGIC OR WHETHER RELEVANT LOGICIANS CAN JUSTIFY RELEVANCE LOGIC
MY VIEWS ON THIS ARE NOT VERY WELL SET BUT I DO THINK WE CAN SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK CLASSICAL LOGIC IS THE BEST MODEL WE HAVE OF OUR BASIC DEDUCTIVE REASONING IT HAS MANY MANY PROBLEMS LIKE ALL MODELS IT SWIMS IN A TIDE POOL OF ANOMALIES BUT IT S BETTER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER LOGICS THAT IT COMMONLY COMPETES WITH THERE MIGHT BE GOOD REASONS TO THINK THAT OTHER LOGICS ARE BETTER MODELS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES EAST G REASONING IN A DATABASE WITH INCONSISTENT INFORMATION AND SO ONE MIGHT THINK THAT LOGICAL PLURALISM IS IN ORDER I LL IGNORE LOGICAL PLURALISM FOR NOW THUS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER LOGIC CAN BE RATIONALLY REVISED IS FOR ME ASKING WHETHER IT WOULD BE RATIONAL TO CHANGE OUR REASONING PRACTICES SO THAT SOME OTHER LOGIC PRESUMABLY A WEAKER ONE SINCE CLASSICAL LOGIC S FAMOUS COMPETITORS ARE WEAKER BEST MODELS OUR REASONING PRACTICES FOR ME THIS IS A NUMBER SUCH A CHANGE WOULD REQUIRE US TO NO LONGER REASON IN SOME WAY THAT IS MODELED BY CLASSICAL LOGIC YES SOMETIMES THOSE WAYS OF REASONING LEAD TO TROUBLE BUT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES THEY DON TENSE SO IT S ALWAYS BETTER TO FIGURE OUT SOME KIND OF WAY TO IDENTIFY THE TROUBLE SPOTS AND AVOID THEM OR MAKE OTHER CHANGES THERE RATHER THAN GIVE UP REASONING THAT WORKS WELL ALMOST EVERYWHERE

HI PROFESSOR SCHARP
I AM IN NO POSITION TO BENEFIT FROM YOUR WORK AS OF BUT REGARDLESS I HAVE FOUND ENJOYMENT IN READING YOUR BOOK REPLACING PHILOSOPHY THIS BOOK HAS IT'S FOCUS ON METHODOLOGY AND SO I WOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DIDN'T RELATE THIS QUESTION TO A PROBLEM I AM HAVING DURING YOUR EARLY TWENTIES YOU WOULD OF BECAME INCREASINGLY ADEPT AT DIGESTING PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS CONCEPTS AND BOOKS
WHAT BOOKS PERSONALLY INSPIRED YOUR DESIRE TO BECOME AN AVID READER HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE TRANSFORMATION THAT IMPROVED YOUR READING ABILITY
THANKS AND ALL THE BEST MATTHEW

KS

WHEN I STARTED DOING PHILOSOPHY I WASN T A VERY CAREFUL OR FAST READER BUT I TOOK A SPEED READING COURSE AS A GRADUATE STUDENT AND IN THE INTERVENING YEARS I WORKED HARD TO DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO READ VERY QUICKLY WITHOUT SACRIFICING COMPREHENSION I THINK THIS SKILL IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE CAN HAVE AS A PHILOSOPHER A FEW PHILOSOPHERS ARE JUST BRILLIANT THEY CAN JUST SAY DEEP AND INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT A TOPIC WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID ABOUT IT I M NOT BRILLIANT INSTEAD FOR ME AND THE REST OF US THE KEY TO DEPTH IS BREADTH THAT IS WE NEED A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF SOME TOPIC AND HOW IT RELATES TO LOTS OF OTHER TOPICS IN ORDER TO SAY SOMETHING DEEP AND INTERESTING ABOUT IT THE KEY TO BREADTH IS BEING ABLE TO ABSORB INFORMATION QUICKLY SO I TAKE READING ABILITY TO BE A KEY COMPONENT TO PHILOSOPHICAL SUCCESS FOR ME AND THE REST OF THE

I M GUESSING THAT WASN T EXACTLY THE ANSWER YOU WERE LOOKING FOR YOU WANT SOMETHING LIKE A LIST OF BOOKS THAT INSPIRED ME TO DEDICATE MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATION I D SAY THAT NIETZSCHE S GENEALOGY OF MORALS HEGEL S PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT WITTGENSTEIN S INVESTIGATIONS HEIDEGGER S BEING AND TIME AND RUSSELL S HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY EACH HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON ME AND SPURRED ME ON TO BECOME A BETTER PHILOSOPHER IF I HAD TO PICK A FAVORITE PHILOSOPHER IT WOULD BE NIETZSCHE HIS WRITING RESONATES WITH ME IN A WAY THAT NOTHING ELSE REALLY DOES

PHILOSOFERN
HELLO PROFESSOR SCHARP THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO CONDUCT THIS AMA LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I GREATLY ADMIRE YOUR WORK AND DEDICATION TO THIS PROJECT AS I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN PURSUING ASCENDING AND DESCENDING TRUTH FOR QUITE SOME TIME
I HAVE GREAT DOUBTS ABOUT THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF YOUR WORK IN PARTICULAR I FIND YOUR CLAIM THAT IT SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH CONSISTENT CONCEPTS THAT CAN DO TRUTH S JOB WITHOUT GIVING RISE TO PARADOXES DISCONCERTING I TRUST THAT YOU'VE DONE THE RELEVANT WORK TO SOLVE TRUTH RELATED PARADOXES THAT PRESENTLY EXIST DUE TO THE CANONICAL CONCEPT OF TRUE HOWEVER IN SOLVING THESE PARADOXES WITH YOUR ASCENDING TRUTH AND DESCENDING TRUTH MIGHT YOU HAVE CREATED A NEW PARADOX OR TWO WITHIN YOUR FRAMEWORK

WHILE I CANNOT POINT TO A GLARING FLAW IN YOUR CURRENT THEORY MY SUSPICION ARISES FROM AN INTUITION I HAVE GATHERED IN MY ACADEMIC PURSUITS AS I SEE IT EVERY THEORETICAL FIELD IS VULNERABLE TO AN IDIOSYNCRATIC INCONSISTENCY FROM THE MICROSCOPIC QUANTUM INDETERMINACY EXEMPLIFIED BY UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE TO THE MACROSCOPIC BREAKDOWN OF SPACETIME A LA GENERAL BLACK HOLES AND EVEN IN THE VERY FOUNDATIONAL CORE OF MATHEMATICAL LOGIC I'M SURE YOU ARE WELL VERSED IN INCOMPLETENESS THEOREMS THE UNIVERSE TENDS TO BUCK AT ANY SIGN OF ABSOLUTE MASTERY

WHAT MAKES YOU SO CERTAIN THAT YOUR THEORY IS IMMUNE FROM THIS FATAL REVENGE

I RECOGNIZE THAT A REDDIN AMA CAN ONLY PROVIDE SO MUCH SPACE FOR ANSWERING A QUESTION SUCH AS MINE AND THAT FURTHER THE SOLUTION MIGHT JUST RESIDE IN A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF YOUR WORK PERHAPS THE SOLUTION IS AS SIMPLE AS SURRENDERING TO INCONSISTENCY FROM THE AS YOU'VE DONE YET WE FIND IN THE EXAMPLE OF GIT THAT AXIOMATIZING THE GDEL SENTENCE ONLY CREATES A NEW SYSTEM WITH A NEW SET OF PROBLEMS SO PERHAPS NOT

IN ANY CASE ANY RESPONSE AND GUIDANCE THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE HERE WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED


KS

THANKS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC WHEN DEALING WITH THE TRUTH PARADOXES IT IS VERY HARD TO AVOID CONTRADICTING YOURSELF AND SO IN THE LOGICIANS SORT OF TOOK OVER THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE LOGIC HAS VERY PRECISE TOOLS FOR FIGURING OUT WHETHER THERE ARE ANY LURKING CONTRADICTIONS IN SOMEONE S PROPOSAL

ONE IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THIS PURPOSE IS A RELATIVE CONSISTENCY PROOF TYPICALLY A THEORIST PROPOSES A FORMAL LANGUAGE AND SHOWS HOW TO ADD A TRUTH PREDICATE TO THAT LANGUAGE THE THEORIST DEMONSTRATES VARIOUS FEATURES OF THE TRUTH PREDICATE AND THE LANGUAGE THAT ARE RELEVANT TO SOLVING THE PARADOXES THEN THE THEORIST IS EXPECTED TO PROVE THAT THE FORMAL SYSTEM IS CONSISTENT AND THUS IT HARBORS NO SECRET CONTRADICTIONS OR PARADOXES BECAUSE OF GODEL S SECOND INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM ONE CANNOT JUST PROVE THAT A SYSTEM IS CONSISTENT I M BEING VERY SLOPPY HERE FOR ACCESSIBILITY INSTEAD THE THEORIST PROVIDES A RELATIVE CONSISTENCY PROOF WHICH IS THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR THE RELATIVE CONSISTENCY PROOF DEMONSTRATES THAT IF SOME WELL-KNOWN AND TRUSTED MATHEMATICAL THEORY IS CONSISTENT THEN THE THEORIST S FORMAL SYSTEM IS CONSISTENT TOO IT IS COMMON TO USE PFC ZERMELO FRANKEL SET THEORY WITH THE AXIOM OF CHOICE BUT OTHERS ARE USED TOO ONCE ONE HAS A RELATIVE CONSISTENCY PROOF ONE KNOWS THAT THERE AREN T ANY PARADOXES OR CONTRADICTIONS HIDING IN ONE S FORMAL SYSTEM UNLESS THEY ARE ALSO HIDING IN PFC ITSELF I GAVE A RELATIVE CONSISTENCY PROOF FOR MY FORMAL SYSTEM IN MY BOOK REPLACING TRUTH

A RELATIVE CONSISTENCY PROOF GOES A LONG WAY BUT IT ISN T THE FINAL WORD PROBLEMS CAN CROP UP BECAUSE WE ULTIMATELY CARE ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PARADOXES AS THEY OCCUR IN NATURAL LANGUAGES AND IN THOUGHT BUT THE THEORIST PROVES RELATIVE CONSISTENCY ONLY FOR A FORMAL LANGUAGE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO MODEL NATURAL LANGUAGE IT CAN HAPPEN THAT NEW PARADOXES CROP UP WHEN ONE THINKS ABOUT HOW THE FORMAL LANGUAGE IS SUPPOSED TO MODEL NATURAL LANGUAGE I ARGUED IN REPLACING TRUTH THAT IT HAPPENS FOR HARRY FIELD S PROPOSAL FOR EXAMPLES SEE PP AND PP

THE LESSON IS THAT CAUTION IS REQUIRED WHEN CLAIMING THAT ONE S APPROACH TO THE TRUTH PARADOXES HAS AVOIDED ALL THE REVENGE PROBLEMS I BASICALLY DARED THE READER TO COME UP WITH REVENGE PARADOXES FOR MY SYSTEM AND LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE TRIED THERE ARE SEVERAL PAPERS EITHER PUBLISHED OR FORTHCOMING THAT CONTAIN THESE ATTEMPTS I HAVE YET TO SEE ANY ATTEMPT THAT DOESN T REST ON A MISTAKE SO MY ATTITUDE IS CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM I DON T THINK THERE ARE ANY NEW REVENGE PARADOXES ASSOCIATED WITH MY PROPOSAL BUT GIVEN THE TENACITY OF THE REVENGE PROBLEM I WOULDN T REALLY BE SURPRISED IF SOME CLEVER PERSON FOUND ONE

ONE LAST POINT ON YOUR COMMENT ABOUT SURRENDERING TO INCONSISTENCY IT S CRUCIAL TO NOTE THAT I M OFFERING A CONSISTENT THEORY OF OUR INCONSISTENT CONCEPT OF TRUTH THAT S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO GO MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT TRUTH IS AN INCONSISTENT CONCEPT EMBRACE THE INCONSISTENCY SO MUCH THAT THEY THINK SOME CONTRADICTIONS ARE TRUE AND THEY ENDORSE LOGICS THAT ARE SO WEAK THAT CONTRADICTIONS DON T CAUSE ANY TROUBLE THIS VIEW IS CALLED PARACONSISTENT DIALETHEISM DIALETHEISM IS THE IDEA THAT SOME CONTRADICTIONS ARE TRUE AND PARACONSISTENT LOGICS ARE THOSE THAT CAN HANDLE TRUE CONTRADICTIONS WITHOUT EXPLODING I M OPPOSED TO THIS VIEW ON MY ACCOUNT WE CAN CONSISTENTLY DESCRIBE OUR INCONSISTENT CONCEPT OF TRUTH WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE SO I AM SURRENDERING TO INCONSISTENCY IN ONE SENSE SAYING THAT OUR CONCEPT IS INCONSISTENT BUT IN ANOTHER SENSE I M DEEPLY RESISTANT TO IT INSISTING ON A CONSISTENT OVERALL THEORY

HOWDY DR SCHARP

YOU'VE STATED IN YOUR DEBATE WITH WILLIAM LANE CRAIG THAT CENTURY ATHEISM IS COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF REDUCTIVE NATURALISM BUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME HOW AN ATHEISTIC WORLD-VIEW DOES NOT REDUCE TO OR PERHAPS ENTAIL NATURALISM

THANK YOU FOR TAKING OUT TIME TO DO THIS AMA AND ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS I ENJOYED YOUR ATTITUDE AND PREPAREDNESS IN YOUR DEBATE WITH ONE OF FINEST APOLOGISTS TAKE CARE

KS
THANKS CRAIG IS AN INTIMIDATING GUY ON PAPER I MEAN IN PERSON HE'S DELIGHTFUL AND I WORKED HARD TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HIS ENTIRE SYSTEM FROM THE INSIDE

I THINK ONE CAN ARGUE FOR ATHEISM WITHOUT ASSUMING REDUCTIVE NATURALISM I EAST THAT EVERYTHING CAN BE EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF SCIENCE I GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF ONE SUCH ARGUMENT IN THE DEBATE THE CONFIDENCE ARGUMENT SO ONE CAN FORMULATE AND DEFEND A REASONABLE ATHEISM WITHOUT ASSUMING NATURALISM

MOREOVER REDUCTIVE NATURALISM IS DEEPLY IMPLAUSIBLE AND LEAVES THE ATHEIST WHO RELIES ON IT IN A VERY WEAK POSITION I DON'T THINK THAT REDUCTIVE EXPLANATIONS OF MORALITY AESTHETICS REASONS MEANING OR CONSCIOUSNESS ARE ANY GOOD REDUCTIVE EXPLANATION IS VERY DEMANDING AND I DON'T SEE ANY OF THOSE REDUCTIVE PROJECTS BEING SUCCESSFUL SO WHEN AN ATHEIST ADOPTS REDUCTIVE NATURALISM IT'S LIKE SHE IS TYING BOTH HANDS BEHIND HER BACK IN A FIGHT

HI MR SCHARP
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT BIG THING IN METAPHYSICS MORE SPECIFICALLY WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE OR WILL BE THE NEXT DEBATE OR ISSUE TO WORK ON IN THIS FIELD

KS

I THINK PHILOSOPHERS ARE USUALLY TERRIBLE AT PREDICTING WHAT ARE GOING TO BE HOT TOPICS AND I DOUBT I M ANY BETTER HOWEVER I DO EXPECT THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE LOTS OF WORK ON WHAT WE MIGHT THINK OF AS NEW FOUNDATIONS FOR METAPHYSICS BETWEEN THE HEIGHT OF LOGICAL POSITIVISM IN THE EARLY CENTURY AND THE MID METAPHYSICS WAS NOT VERY POPULAR BUT THEN IT BECAME A MAJOR FOCUS OF RESEARCH AND HAS BEEN SINCE THEN WHEN IT REEMERGED IN THE AND MANY OF ITS MOST IMPORTANT DEFENDERS EAST G LEWIS USED MODAL CONCEPTS EAST G POSSIBILITY NECESSITY CONTINGENCY AS THE BASIS FOR DOING METAPHYSICS HOWEVER IN THE PAST DECADE OR SO MANY METAPHYSICIANS HAVE GIVEN UP USING MODAL NOTIONS AND HAVE INSTEAD CRAFTED A NEW FOUNDATION FOR METAPHYSICS USING CONCEPTS LIKE FUNDAMENTALITY AND GROUNDING EAST G SIDER FINE I THINK ONE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE A CONTINUED EMPHASIS ON THIS NEW FOUNDATIONS PROJECT

YOU DID STICK A SHOULD IN YOUR QUESTION SO I MIGHT MENTION THAT ONE TOPIC THAT SHOULD GET ATTENTION BUT PROBABLY WON T IS THE LEGITIMACY OF CAUSAL CONCEPTS CAUSATION IS A HUGE TOPIC IN METAPHYSICS BUT IN MY VIEW CAUSATION IS A SERIOUSLY DEFECTIVE CONCEPT THAT SHOULDN T BE USED FOR SERIOUS THEORIZING A NUMBER OF PHILOSOPHERS HAVE HELD THIS VIEW AS WELL RUSSELL DAVIDSON NORTON BUT IT CERTAINLY ISN T MAINSTREAM THE PHYSICIST SEAN CARROLL IN HIS NEW BOOK THE BIG PICTURE HAS AN ACCESSIBLE DISCUSSION OF THIS TOPIC AS WELL

RUNNINGWITHTHEBULLS

FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOUR DEBATE WITH WILLIAM CRAIG DEMOLISHED ANY RESERVATIONS I HAD ABOUT ABANDONING CHRISTIANITY ON FEAR OF BEING WRONG AND GOING TO HELL FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY NEWLY COLD BLACK ATHEIST HEART THANK YOU DO YOU THINK RELIGION IS HARMFUL AND IF SO WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO SPREAD THE ATHEISTIC WORLD-VIEW

KS
YOU'RE WELCOME I'M GLAD THE DEBATE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON YOU THANKS FOR SAYING SO

I THINK RELIGION CAN BE HARMFUL BUT IT HAS PLAYED AN ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL ROLE IN HUMAN HISTORY FOR EXAMPLE MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHERS LARGELY ARRIVED AT THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD SO ANYONE INTERESTED IN SCIENCE OR BENEFITING FROM THE ADVANCES SCIENCE HAS GIVEN US OWES THESE RELIGIOUS THINKERS A DEBT OF GRATITUDE

I'M NOT SURE WHETHER HUMANITY IS AT A POINT WHERE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR EVERYONE TO GIVE UP RELIGION PERHAPS WE ARE BUT I TEND TO DOUBT IT SO I DON'T REALLY TRY TO SPREAD ATHEISM IN THE SENSE OF TRYING TO TALK RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR RELIGION OBVIOUSLY I DO DEFEND ATHEISM BUT MY GOAL IS TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT THEIR BELIEFS AND VALUES AND CONCEPTS IF AFTER DOING THAT AN ATHEIST COMES TO BE RELIGIOUS THEN THAT'S FINE WITH ME

WHAT I REALLY DON'T LIKE IS WHEN RELIGIOUS VIEWS HAVE A PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE ON PUBLIC POLICY FOR EXAMPLE IGNORING THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE ONE IS CONVINCED THAT GOD WOULD NEVER LET HUMANS GO EXTINCT

HI KEVIN THANKS FOR JOINING US GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE

I WAS HOPING YOU COULD SAY SOME MORE ABOUT THE NEW PROJECT REPLACING PHILOSOPHY YOU NOTE THAT YOU THINK MOST COMMONLY DISCUSSED PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS ARE INCONSISTENT COULD YOU NOTE WHY ONE OR TWO OF THESE APART FROM TRUTH IS INCONSISTENT ON YOUR VIEW WITH TRUTH THERE IS A SET OF CONSTITUTIVE PRINCIPLES OF THE CONCEPT WHICH YOU ARGUE ARE INCONSISTENT DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ALL CONCEPTS HAVE SOME SET OF CONSTITUTIVE PRINCIPLES AND FURTHER THAT THOSE PRINCIPLES ARE INCONSISTENT OR DO YOU APPLY DIFFERENT METHODS TO SHOW THAT EAST G VIRTUE IS INCONSISTENT

I'D ALSO LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT THE RELATION OF YOUR CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING PROGRAM TO OTHER ACCOUNTS OF CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS LIKE THE CANBERRA PLAN OF WHICH I'M A BIG FAN ON ONE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CANBERRA PLAN IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY EACH CONCEPT BEING ANALYSED WOULD HAVE SUCH PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE CORE THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES WHICH DEFINE THE CONCEPT IN QUESTION BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT OTHER TYPES OF CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS WOULD REQUIRE THIS
FROM THE ANNOUNCEMENT PAGE


I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU I REALIZE THAT YOU MAY NOT GET TO BOTH OR EITHER OF THEM BUT I AM VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR ANSWERS

ON CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING I SEE THAT YOU DISTINGUISH CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING FROM OTHER METHODOLOGIES LIKE THE CANBERRA PLAN WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE CARNACIAN EXPLICATION ARE THERE ANY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING AND EXPLICATION IS ONE PERHAPS A SPECIES OF THE OTHER
2 IN ONE OF THE VIDEOS ABOVE YOU CITED TED ONTOLOGISE AS A CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING PROJECT IN ONTOLOGISE THE EXISTENTIAL QUANTIFIER IS REENGINEERED TO BE FUNDAMENTAL IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE SUBSTANTIVITY OF ONTOLOGICAL DISPUTES IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WERE HINTING AT A DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING PROJECTS THERE ARE THOSE WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY IMPROVING OUR CONCEPTS IN SOME SENSE AND THERE ARE THOSE WHERE WE ARE SIMPLY DEFINING OURSELVES OUT OF SOME PROBLEM DO YOU THINK BOTH TYPES OF PROJECTS ARE WORTHWHILE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ONTOLOGISE


BY THE WAY REALLY ENJOYED YOUR DEBATE AGAINST WILLIAM LANE CRAIG


KS

THANKS I ENJOYED DOING THE WAC DEBATE I HOPE TO DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME SOON

I THINK OF EXPLICATION AS ONE FORM OF CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING I CAN SEE SOMEONE DISAGREEING WITH ME ON CERTAIN CASES FOR EXAMPLE IF THE CONCEPT HAS EXACTLY THE SAME CONSTITUTIVE PRINCIPLES AS THE CONCEPT BUT MAYBE NO ONE WOULD CALL SUCH A CASE EXPLICATION
ABOUT ONTOLOGISE YOU AND I DISAGREE A BIT ON SIDER S PROJECT WHICH HE CALLS PLAN B IN WRITING THE BOOK OF THE WORLD AS I UNDERSTAND IT SIDER WANTS TO SAY THAT WHEN PEOPLE DISAGREE ABOUT ONTOLOGY SAY A METEROLOGICAL NIHILIST AND SOMEONE WHO ACCEPTS THE EXISTENCE OF COMPOSITES THE DISAGREEMENT IS SUBSTANTIVE HOWEVER THERE ARE CRITICS LIKE HIRSCH WHO THINK THAT THESE DISAGREEMENTS ARE MERELY VERBAL THEY USUALLY APPEAL TO QUANTIFIER VARIANCE TO MAKES THIS CASE AND THE VIEW IS OFTEN CALLED ONTOLOGICAL DEFLATIONIST SIDER IN RESPONSE TO THIS WORRY ADMITS THAT THE CRITIC MIGHT BE RIGHT BUT IF SO THE METAPHYSICIAN CAN SIMPLY STIPULATE NEW QUANTIFIERS THAT DON T EXHIBIT QUANTIFIER VARIANCE AND THEN CONDUCT THE ONTOLOGICAL DISPUTE IN THE NEW LANGUAGE WHICH HE CALLS ONTOLOGISE SO I THINK ONTOLOGISE HAS QUANTIFIERS AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT TAGS ALONG THAT DON T VARY ACROSS CONTEXTS WHEREAS YOU THINK THAT ONTOLOGISE HAS QUANTIFIERS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL I SUPPOSE YOUR VIEW ENTAILS MINE SINCE THE FUNDAMENTAL IS ALSO INVARIANT ACCORDING TO SIDER SO MINE IS WEAKER

EITHER WAY AS LONG AS THE NEW QUANTIFIER IN ONTOLOGISE HAS CONSTITUTIVE PRINCIPLES EAST G BEING INVARIANT THAT THE OLD QUANTIFIER OF ENGLISH DOESN'T HAVE THEN THIS IS A CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING PROJECT I DIDN'T MEAN TO INDICATE A DISTINCTION ALONG THE LINES YOU DESCRIBE MY REASON IS THAT GOOD CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING PROJECTS SHOULD ALSO ILLUMINATE OUR LANGUAGE AS IT IS NOW BEFORE THE CONCEPTUAL CHANGE I TRIED HARD TO DO THAT IN REPLACING TRUTH

HI PROFESSOR SCHARP SINCE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COHERENCE OF TRUTH CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT UNDEFINABILITY THEOREM ACTUALLY MEANS FOR THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE WORK YOU'RE DOING

KS

THE FIRST THING TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT TARSKI S THEOREM IS A TECHNICAL RESULT THAT APPLIES ONLY TO CERTAIN FORMAL LANGUAGES IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT A NATURAL LANGUAGE LIKE ENGLISH EXCEPT INSOFAR AS ENGLISH CAN BE MODELED BY CERTAIN FORMAL LANGUAGES THE THEOREM STATES THAT IN CERTAIN FORMAL LANGUAGES THERE CAN BE NO TRUTH PREDICATE THE PROOF OF THE THEOREM IS USUALLY BY REDUCTIO AND IT USES SOMETHING LIKE A LIAR SENTENCE TO DERIVE THE CONTRADICTION CRUCIALLY THE THEOREM ASSUMES THAT THE FORMAL LANGUAGES IN QUESTION OBEY CLASSICAL LOGIC ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE STRENGTHENED IN VARIOUS WAYS FOR OTHER LOGICS AND THAT TRUTH PREDICATES HAVE CERTAIN PROPERTIES LIKE OBEYING SCHEMA T P IS TRUE IF AND ONLY IF Q WHERE ONE SUBSTITUTES IN FOR P THE NAME OF THE SENTENCE THAT STANDS IN FOR Q

BECAUSE THE THEOREM HAS THESE ASSUMPTIONS ONE CAN AVOID IT BY FOCUSING ON LANGUAGES FOR WHICH THESE ASSUMPTIONS FAIL FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK ON DEFINING TRUTH IN LANGUAGES THAT DO NOT OBEY CLASSICAL LOGIC THERE IS ALSO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK ON DEFINING TRUTH PREDICATES THAT DO NOT OBEY SCHEMA TENSE

AS FOR MY OWN WORK I THINK WE ARE BETTER OFF STICKING WITH CLASSICAL LOGIC AS A MODEL FOR OUR REASONING PRACTICES WHICH MEANS THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE THE BEST WAY OF UNDERSTANDING HOW OUR TRUTH PREDICATES IN NATURAL LANGUAGES SUBTLY FAIL TO OBEY SCHEMA TENSE THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRICKY FOR ME BECAUSE I THINK SCHEMA T IS CONSTITUTIVE OF OUR CONCEPT OF TRUTH THAT IS SCHEMA T IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DETERMINE THE MEANING OF OUR WORD TRUE

LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN CONSTITUTIVE PRINCIPLES THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO BE TRUE HOWEVER IT IS A CENTRAL PART OF MY PROJECT TO MAKE SENSE OF INCONSISTENT CONCEPTS I EAST THOSE THAT HAVE SOME FALSE CONSTITUTIVE PRINCIPLES I THINK SCHEMA T OR SOME OF ITS INSTANCES TO BE MORE PRECISE IS FALSE EVEN THOUGH IT IS CONSTITUTIVE OF OUR CONCEPT OF TRUTH

SO TO SUM UP I THINK THAT SCHEMA T IS CONSTITUTIVE OF OUR CONCEPT OF TRUTH ON BROADLY LINGUISTIC GROUNDS AND I THINK THAT CLASSICAL LOGIC IS THE BEST MODEL FOR OUR DEDUCTIVE REASONING AND OUR LOGICAL VOCABULARY THUS TARSKI S THEOREM FORCES ME TO ADMIT THAT SOME INSTANCES OF SCHEMA T ARE FALSE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE CONSTITUTIVE

I THINK THE BEST RECENT DISCUSSION OF TARSKI S THEOREM IS IN HARRY FIELD S BOOK SAVING TRUTH FROM PARADOX CHAPTER

FROM THE ANNOUNCEMENT PAGE

RUNNINGWITHTHEBULLS

CAN AN ATHEIST HAVE JUSTIFIED BELIEF FOR THE OBJECTIVITY OF MORAL VALUES AND DUTIES ARE WE LOOSING ANYTHING WITH SUBJECTIVE MORALITY

KS YES THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEORIES THAT TAKE MORAL VALUES AND DUTIES TO BE OBJECTIVE THAT DO NOT INVOKE ANYTHING SUPERNATURAL MOST CONTEMPORARY VERSIONS OF CONSEQUENTIALISM ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF VERSIONS OF DEONTOLOGICAL ETHICS THAT DO THE SAME A GOOD BOOK ON THIS IS DAVID TAKING MORALITY SERIOUSLY

LOTS OF PEOPLE THEIST AND ATHEIST THINK THAT ATHEISTS ARE STUCK WITH SOME KIND OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF MORALITY I TOTALLY REJECT THIS IT'S BASED ON ASSOCIATING ATHEISM WITH REDUCTIVE NATURALISM WHICH I ALSO REJECT

FROM THE ANNOUNCEMENT

RUNNINGWITHTHEBULLS

WHEN I TELL PEOPLE ABOUT MY ATHEISM THE MOST COMMON QUESTION I GET IS HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THE MEANINGLESSNESS OF LIFE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO QUESTIONS LIKE THESE WHERE RELIGIOUS PEOPLE EQUATE NOT BELIEVING IN THEIR GOD TO A MEANINGLESS EXISTENCE

KS
I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUES FOR THE ATHEIST TO DEAL WITH I LIKE TO THINK OF THE DOES LIFE HAVE A MEANING QUESTION AS HAVING TWO DISTINCT READINGS IS THERE SOMETHING I SHOULD BE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH MY LIFE A GOAL FOR LIFE AND IS MY LIFE PART OF SOME OVERARCHING PLAN FOR THE UNIVERSE

I THINK THAT THE FIRST READING THE GOAL READING DOES HAVE AN ANSWER FROM THE ATHEIST ATHEISTS CAN ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE OBJECTIVE MORAL VALUES AND DUTIES WHATEVER ACTIONS TURN OUT TO BE MORALLY GOOD THOSE ARE THE ONES YOU SHOULD BE PURSUING THOSE SHOULD BE YOUR GOALS IN LIFE SO ATHEISTS CAN ACCEPT THAT LIFE HAS A MEANING IN THIS GOAL SENSE OF MEANING

I THINK THE SECOND READING IS MORE DIFFICULT I DON'T THINK ATHEISTS ARE JUSTIFIED IN THINKING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS GOVERNED BY SOME KIND OF SUPERNATURAL PLAN SO IF THE PLAN HAS TO BE SUPERNATURAL THEN THE ATHEIST SHOULD SAY NO TO DOES MY LIFE HAVE MEANING IN THIS PLAN SENSE HOWEVER I DON'T SEE WHY THE PLAN HAS TO BE SUPERNATURAL SEEING ONE'S LIFE AS A PART OF THE UNFOLDING OF THE UNIVERSE FROM BIG BANG TO HEAT DEATH DOES ALLOW ONE TO THINK OF ONE'S LIFE AS PART OF A PLAN IT'S JUST THAT THE PLAN ISN'T TELEOLOGICAL OR INTENTIONAL

I'M SURE LOTS OF PEOPLE THINK THE SECOND POINT IS BOGUS HOWEVER YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF WHAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER TO THE DOES LIFE HAVE A MEANING QUESTION IF I BELIEVED THAT GOD IS EVIL AND MY LIFE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN GOD'S EVIL PLAN WOULD I STILL SAY YES MY LIFE IS MEANINGFUL IF YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT THEN THERE IS MORE THAN JUST A PLAN BEING PRESUPPOSED IN THE ORIGINAL QUESTION

HI THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA AND WELCOME TO SCOTLAND

MY QUESTION IS SLIGHTLY OFF TOPIC BUT MAYBE YOU HAVE AN ANSWER IS THERE ANY WAY TO ARGUE AGAINST

IE A CLAIM IS MADE LIKE THIS KITE IS BLUE AND THE APPROACH IS WHAT FOUNDATION DO YOU BASE THAT BELIEF ON THE IDEA BEING THAT IF YOU KEEP ASKING IT NOBODY WILL EVER BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THEMSELVES BEARING IN MIND IT TOOK BERTRAND RUSSELL HALF A TOME TO PROVE 2 HOW CAN ANYTHING BUT THE MOST INCONSEQUENTIAL OF THINGS BE TRUE

SECONDLY WHAT IS THE MOST OUTLANDISH THING YOU BELIEVE OR AT LEAST WOULD SEEM OUTLANDISH TO SOMEBODY WHO DOES DOES NOT DO PHILOSOPHY

THANK YOU
HI THANKS FOR DOING THIS

COULD YOU EXPAND A BIT ON HOW YOU ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO FOCUS ON ANALYTIC OVER CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY GIVEN THAT YOU APPEAR TO HAVE AT LEAST AT ONE POINT BEEN INTERESTED IN BOTH AND AS A FOLLOW-UP DO YOU THINK THE STATE OF THE ACADEMY IS CURRENTLY SUCH THAT A DECISION BETWEEN THE TWO IS ULTIMATELY A NECESSARY ONE FOR THOSE INTENDING TO PURSUE AN ACADEMIC CAREER IN PHILOSOPHY

THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS AMA DR SCHARP

COULD YOU SHARE WITH US WHAT YOUR VIEW ON THE NATURE OF TRUTH SEEMS TO IMPLY FOR PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE SPECIFICALLY IT SEEMS TO RADICALLY REDEFINE THE TERMS OF THE SCIENTIFIC REALISM ANTIREALISM DEBATE AND SINCE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PHIL SCI I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
I THOUGH OF MORE QUESTIONS

I THINK AS AN UNDERGRADUATE SCIENCE STUDENT THINKING ABOUT TRUTH AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE CAN BE QUITE OVERWHELMING SOMETIMES IT CAN BE SO TO THE EXTENT THAT IT LEADS ONE TO A SORT OF PARALYSIS IN WHICH ONE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO GO ON WITH RESEARCH BECAUSE ONE FEELS LIKE ONE ISN'T SURE WHETHER THEIR RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO FIND SOME TRUTH WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE STUDENTS OF SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES SHOULD WE SIMPLY TRY NOT TO WORRY AND JUST CONTINUE WITH RESEARCH AND LET THE PHILOSOPHERS DEAL WITH IT OR DO YOU THINK THAT SCIENCE WOULD ACTUALLY BE A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE TODAY IF SCIENTISTS WERE INTRODUCED TO PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE EARLIER ON IN THEIR CAREERS
I RECENTLY GOT THE OFFER OF STUDYING HONOURS IN PHILOSOPHY I LOVE ETHICS AND MORALITY ETC SHOULD I DO HONOURS PROS CONS JOBS
HELLO PROFESSOR SCHARP

GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE AND THANK YOU

MY QUESTION IS DO YOU BELIEVE LANGUAGE IS A HUMAN ONLY QUALITY AND ARE LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION ONE IN THE SAME OR ARE THEY DIFFERENT DOES ONE NEED LANGUAGE TO COMMUNICATE AND DOES ALL LANGUAGE NEED TO BE COMMUNICATED

SINCE YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE I WONDER YOUR THOUGHTS ON A THEORY OF MEANING
DO YOU THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT MEANING IS THE EXTENSION OF WORDS FOR THIS TO WORK EXTENSION WOULD NEED TO BE EXCLUSIVELY MENTAL BUT THAT IS SURELY PLAUSIBLE I KNOW I'M AN IDEALIST ONE THING THAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IDEA OF MEANING AS EXTENSION IS THAT THE EXTENSION OF DOG WOULD BE THE SPECIFIC DOG THE SPEAKER IS THINKING ABOUT ALTHOUGH ALL DOGS THAT COULD BE THOUGHT OF COULD BE THE EXTENSION THEY ONLY ARE WHEN THEY ARE IN THE MIND YOU MAY BEGIN TO SEE THE PARALLELS WITH RELATIONAL QUANTUM MECHANICS EVEN IN THE MACRO SCALE THE MOON BEING LIKE EVERYTHING ENTIRELY MENTAL ONLY EXISTS WHEN IN YOUR THOUGHTS
AS YOU CAN SEE ALL MEANINGFUL WORDS WOULD THEREFORE HAVE EXTENSIONS PERHAPS THOUGHTS ABOUT LINKING SPECIFIC CLAUSES SUCH AS AND AS WELL AS TERMS AND FICTIONAL CHARACTER'S NAMES
THANKS FOR YOUR THOUGHTS

I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT READING YOUR FUTURE WORK WHILE I'M FAMILIAR WITH WORK ON TRUTH SEEING HOW IT FITS INTO THE BROADER PROJECT OF REPLACING PHILOSOPHY WOULD BE FASCINATING

I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS

DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS ONE AND ONLY ONE CORRECT LOGIC FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE ARGUMENTS IN OTHER WORDS DO YOU THINK LOGICAL MONISM IS RIGHT

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE JOB MARKET FOR PHILOSOPHERS SHOULD THEY STICK IN PHILOSOPHY OR TRY LOOKING FOR JOBS IN OTHER FIELDS LIKE MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE EDIT YOU SEEM TO HAVE ANSWERED THIS QUESTION ALREADY SO MAYBE SKIP THIS ONE

DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE ARE ANY ACTIVITIES WHICH HAVE MADE YOU A BETTER PHILOSOPHER

HELLO DR SCHARP


MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH YOU WAS WHEN I SAW A DEBATE YOU HAD WITH WILLIAM LANE CRAIG ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER THAT DEBATE BUT I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR THAT WAS SAID FOR REFERENCE HERE IS THE DEBATE TO THE RELEVANT MOMENT

T


YOU ASKED CRAIG WHAT I THINK IS THE CENTRAL QUESTION WHY THINK THAT A BEING WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS CRAIG SPECIFIES WOULD CREATE A UNIVERSE I THINK CRAIG UTTERLY FAILED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION


THAT BEING SAID COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IN YOUR MIND ARE THE POSSIBLE ROUTES A THEIST COULD GO COULD THEY ARGUE GOD IS INSCRUTABLE BUT THEN THEY'VE ADMITTED THAT THEIR EXPLANATION LACKS ANY EMPIRICAL CONTENTION COULD THEY ARGUE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD BY LEANING ON A PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS TRADITION OR WOULD THAT BE QUESTION-BEGGING AGAIN I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU CHART OUT THE POSSIBLE RESPONSES TO YOUR QUESTION AND IF YOU THINK THAT THAT QUESTION IS ESSENTIALLY A CHECKMATE

LOTS OF PEOPLE THEIST AND ATHEIST THINK THAT ATHEISTS ARE STUCK WITH SOME KIND OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF MORALITY I TOTALLY REJECT THIS IT'S BASED ON ASSOCIATING ATHEISM WITH REDUCTIVE NATURALISM WHICH I ALSO REJECT

DO YOU MIND ELABORATING ON THIS HOW CAN AN ATHEIST HAVE OBJECTIVE MORALITY
I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN FIGURING OUT HOW TO THINK CRITICALLY FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS I FIND THAT MANY PEOPLE EVEN HAVING A FOOLPROOF ARGUMENT CAN STILL BE IN ERROR HOW CAN WE AVOID ERRORS SUCH AS WAGER WHICH SEEMS SO CONVINCING AND WHEN DO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TRUTH
WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE WHILE STRADDLING THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE TWO TRADITIONS ANALYTIC CONTINENTAL WHAT MIGHT HAVE PULLED YOU THE OTHER WAY
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH SAUL A PUZZLE ABOUT BELIEF

I WONDER ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE PUZZLE IN THE COMMUNITY IF IT IS CONSIDERED IMPORTANT OR UNIMPORTANT SOLVED OR UNSOLVED

I HAVE A POSSIBLE SOLUTION SO OBVIOUS AS TO HAVE ALMOST CERTAINLY BEEN RAISED IN PRINT BUT I CANNOT ACCESS ANY ARTICLES

I'D LIKE TO PROCEED WITH IT AS A PERSONAL PROJECT WITH ASPIRATIONS OF PUBLICATION BUT SUSPECT THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN MADE AND ACCEPTED OR REFUTED

IF YOU CAN SHED ANY LIGHT ON THIS I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT
BEING OFFERED A MILLION POUNDS TO BELIEVE THAT

CAN U ELABORATE ON THIS A LITTLE
HELLO KEVIN I AM A THIRD YEAR UNDERGRADUATE PHI MAJOR AT THE UNIVERSITY AT BUFFALO I REALLY ENJOY YOUR POST A LOT AND LOOK FORWARD TO READING YOUR WORKS MENTIONED I WAS HOPING YOU COULD SHARE WHAT YOUR ARGUMENT IS REGARDING RELIGION THANKS AGAIN FOR THE INSIGHTFUL POST CAN'T WAIT TO READ ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON TRUTH
I THINK THAT YOUR MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS HAS MADE REALISM OBSOLETE THESIS HAS A SERIOUS FLAW I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS ON MY DRIVE HOME FROM WORK

IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS ALL INERTIAL FRAMES OF REFERENCE HAVE THE SAME LAWS OF PHYSICS THAT IS IF YOU ARE ON TRAIN A PASSING BY TRAIN B YOU CANNOT TELL IF YOU ARE MOVING AND TRAIN B IS STILL OR IF TRAIN B IS MOVING AND YOU ARE STILL MATHEMATICALLY SPEAKING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS WORK OUT EXACTLY THE SAME

HOWEVER PHYSICALLY SPEAKING THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE IN REAL LIFE THERE ARE WAYS TO DETERMINE WHICH FRAME IS MOVING AND WHICH FRAME IS STILL WHEN I WAS DRIVING MY CAR IN A SUBURBAN STREET PASSING BY A PARKED CAR FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS I AM UNABLE TO TELL WHETHER IT IS MY CAR THAT IS MOVING OR THE PARKED ONE HOWEVER IT IS OBVIOUS FROM COMMON SENSE THAT THE PARKED CAR IS THE ONE THAT IS NOT MOVING IT IS PARKED ITS ENGINE IS OFF AND IT HAS NO DRIVER WHILE MY CAR IS NOT PARKED ITS ENGINE IS FULLY RUNNING AND I AM DRIVING IT I THINK THE SAME IS TRUE FOR CAUSALITY EVEN IF CAUSALITY DOESN'T SHOW UP IN THE EQUATIONS GOVERNING REALITY WE SHOULDN'T TAKE THAT AS EVIDENCE THAT CAUSALITY ISN'T REAL WE SHOULD TAKE THAT AS EVIDENCE THAT THE EQUATIONS DO NOT GIVE A COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT OF REALITY JUST AS THE MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTION OF INERTIAL FRAMES DOESN'T MEAN THAT IN REAL LIFE I AM COMPLETELY HELPLESS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FRAMES OF REFERENCE I AM NOT AND NEITHER ARE YOU
WHAT ARE SOME READING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A PROSPECTIVE LAW STUDENT TO STRENGTHEN THEIR LOGICAL REASONING I STILL HAVE ABOUT TWO YEARS TO GO BEFORE APPLYING TO LAW SCHOOL I'M FROM SINGAPORE SO LAW IS AN UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IN ITSELF AND I'M CURRENTLY TAKING KNOWLEDGE AND INQUIRY AN EXAMINABLE SUBJECT ABOUT EPISTEMOLOGY IN DIFFERENT AREAS I'VE HAD LITTLE TROUBLE WITH CONSTRUCTING LOGICALLY SOUND ARGUMENTS BUT I'VE ALWAYS FOUND MYSELF HESITANT IN ATTEMPTING TO OUTLINE LOGICAL FALLACIES OF ARGUMENTS I READ
ST ANDREWS STUDENT JUST DROPPING IN TO SAY HI
HELLO

I'M A STUDENT IN ST ANDREWS STUDYING CHEMISTRY AND A KEEN AMATEUR PHILOSOPHER DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR ME OR OTHER AMATEUR PHILOSOPHERS LOOKING FOR LIKE MINDED PEOPLE TO DISCUSS PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS WITH AND EVENTS TO ATTEND

SECONDLY WHO WAS YOUR FAVORITE PHILOSOPHER WHEN YOU BEGAN YOUR CAREER AND HAS YOUR OPINION OF THEM CHANGED SINCE THEN
HELLO DR SCHARP I HAVE JUST DISCOVERED YOUR WORK AND FIND IT INTRIGUING

AS A LAYMAN I AM NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING TRUTH IS AN INCONSISTENT CONCEPT

WOULD I BE RIGHT IN ASSUMING THAT THE LIAR PARADOX IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU MEAN

ARE THERE ANY OTHER EXAMPLES WHICH WOULD MAKE THE IDEA CLEARER

IS FALSEHOOD ALSO AN INCONSISTENT CONCEPT
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE THEORY YOU'RE PROPOSING AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT BUT I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I SPENT A SEMESTER STUDYING ABROAD AT ST ANDREWS AND IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES OF MY ENTIRE LIFE ALSO MY PARENTS WENT TO

I'D LOVE TO SEE MORE PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSIONS PRESENTED BY PHOENIX WRIGHT
IT WAS QUITE STRANGE WHEN THE PHOENIX WRIGHT BAM SUDDENLY STOPPED AND TOUCHOUS BAM STARTED PLAYING

POLITICAL PHILOSOPHER SYSTEMATICALLY RECONSTRUCTS THE LIBERAL SOUNDING ARGUMENTS USED IN SUPPORT OF BLASPHEMY LAWS FREEDOM FROM HARM STATE NEUTRALITY AND TOLERANCE IF YOU'VE EVER HAD ONE OF THESE ARGUMENTS USED AGAINST YOU THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD HAVE REPLIED

INDEED WORLD VALUES SURVEYS SUGGEST THAT MORE LIBERAL SOCIETIES OFTEN HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF TRUST FOR STRANGERS COMPARED TO COMMUNITARIAN OR SOCIALIST ONES EXPLICITLY ORIENTATED TO SOCIAL HARMONY

A PRETTY REMARKABLE CLAIM OFFERED WITHOUT SUPPORT

WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT LIBERALISM OR ANY SUCH SYSTEM FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN THE COMMON GOOD IN THE FIRST PLACE I'M STILL WAITING ON THAT ARGUMENT
WHAT I DON'T GET IS HIS ASSERTION THAT THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF CENSORING BLASPHEMY ARE TRUISMS IN THE LEFT I AM GENUINELY ENTIRELY UNAWARE OF ANY CLAIMS THE LIBERALS AND LEFTISTS AND WHOEVER I AM AWARE OF TEND TO DISAGREE WITH INSULTS TO RELIGION WHEN THEY VIEW THEM AS FACTUALLY INCORRECT OR MISLEADING OR SOMEHOW DEFECTIVE IN SOME OTHER WAY AND LIBERALS OPPOSE HATE SPEECH GENERALLY TO BE CLEAR I'M DISCUSSING LIBERALS AS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LIBERALS WHICH INSULTS TO RELIGION COULD BE AT TIMES

THE ARTICLE IS ALL RIGHT BUT ITS ALL RIGHT FOR THE REASON THAT NO ACTUAL LIBERALS SEEM TO OPPOSE THE RIGHT TO INSULT RELIGION ITS NOT REALLY TARGETED AT ANYONE MORE LIKE GIVING A LIGHT DESCRIPTION OF LIBERAL VALUES ABOUT DISCUSSING RELIGION TO WHOEVER WANTS IT

CHARLIE SATIRICAL CRITICISM OF THE ISLAMIC MUSLIMS LOOKS A LOT LIKE CRITICISM OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE SO AS THE ARTICLE'S AUTHOR ASKS WHERE IS THE HARM
ACCORDING TO GORGIAS ONE REASON LANGUAGE CANNOT COMMUNICATE

THUS IN DEALING WITH LANGUAGE DERRID LIKE GORGIAS WRESTLES WITH SAMENESS AND
DIFFERENCE

BUT DERRID AS I READ HIM MAKES THE POINT THAT A DEFINITIVE FINAL READING CANNOT BE MADE THE GORGIAS QUOTE BEAUTIFULLY CONTRADICTORY THAT IT CANNOT COMMUNICATE

YOU GO ON TO SAY GORGIAS STANCE BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS

THE SOPHIST S SECOND CLAIM THAT A WORD IS NEVER THE SAME TWICE FOR EVEN THE SAME PERSON

THEN THE CLAIM IS NEVER THE SAME TWICE AS IT'S MADE OF WORDS

OF COURSE HE WAS A SOPHIST SO THE IDEA IS MORE THAT HE CAN FRAME ANY ARGUMENT EVEN COUNTER INTUITIVE AND NON REASONABLE AND MAKE THIS CONVINCING WHICH IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT JD WAS ABOUT IMO OTHERS MAY NOT

GORGIAS WRITINGS ARE BOTH RHETORICAL AND PERFORMATIVE HE GOES TO GREAT LENGTHS TO EXHIBIT HIS ABILITY OF MAKING AN ABSURD ARGUMENTATIVE POSITION APPEAR STRONGER CONSEQUENTLY EACH OF HIS WORKS DEFEND POSITIONS THAT ARE UNPOPULAR PARADOXICAL AND EVEN ABSURD

ONE REASON LANGUAGE CANNOT COMMUNICATE IS BECAUSE THINGS ARE
SIMPLY NOT WORDS

AS I SAY I DON'T THINK HE IS BEING REASONABLE SO A RATIONAL RESPONSE SEEMS MISPLACED BUT I'LL THROW IN SOMETHING THAT STRUCK ME PAIN IS A FORM OF COMMUNICATION WHICH SEEMS TO WORK WE NOW KNOW THE PAIN IS ALWAYS IN THE BRAIN ITS HOW ANALGESICS WORK YET WE FEEL IT IN THE BODY EVEN WHEN SAY A LIMB IS ACTUALLY MISSING LANGUAGES ARE NOT PERFECT JD PAIN IS NOT THE BROKEN LEG BUT SURE COMMUNICATES
I THINK JD WOULD SAY PAIN LANGUAGE IS NEVER CLOSED NOT THAT IT IS NEVER MEANINGFUL


AS FOR PRIVATE LANGUAGES I THOUGHT WITTGENSTEIN ARGUED THERE COULD NOT BE ANY

SEE

TO BE PRIVATE THE SYMBOLS NEED TO BE TO ANYONE ELSE SO EVEN TO ME TO GUARANTEE PRIVACY THEREFORE NOT COMMUNICATE AT ALL
IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED PROTAGORAS AND PRODIGUS ARE ALSO GOOD ON THIS SUBJECT OF RELATIVISM
FROM THE ABSTRACT

IF PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT RESOURCES TASTES OR NEEDS THEY MAY BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE GOODS OR SERVICES SUCH THAT THEY EACH FEEL THEY HAVE BEEN MADE BETTER OFFICIAL THIS IS TRADE IF PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT MORAL VIEWS THEN THERE IS ANOTHER TYPE OF TRADE THAT IS POSSIBLE THEY CAN EXCHANGE GOODS OR SERVICES SUCH THAT BOTH PARTIES FEEL THAT THE WORLD IS A BETTER PLACE OR THAT THEIR MORAL OBLIGATIONS ARE BETTER SATISFIED WE CAN CALL THIS MORAL TRADE I INTRODUCE THE IDEA OF MORAL TRADE AND EXPLORE SEVERAL IMPORTANT THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
THAT S RIGHT HE S LOOKING AT YOU REDDIN

AND SOME OF US ARE LOOKING RIGHT BACK AT HIM

FRANKLY I'M EXHAUSTED EVERY TIME I READ ABOUT K BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS HIDING BEHIND THE CHOIR HE'S PREACHING TO INDEED IN THE PREFACE LINKED HEREIN HE EXPRESSES HIS WISH TO STEAL AWAY ENTIRELY MUCH LIKE A FILMMAKER WHO REDIRECTS ANY CRITICISM OF HIS FILM ONTO THE FILM ITSELF DISCLAIMING OWNERSHIP AND AUTHORSHIP IS COWARDLY AND GIVEN WHAT I KNOW OF K THAT SEEMS PAR FOR THE COURSE

I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER K EVER STOPPED TO CONTEMPLATE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE SINCERELY WRONG PENITENT OR IF PART OF HIS AND INVOLVES A HIVE MIND COMPRISED OF INDIVIDUAL BEINGS OF COURSE WHO HAVE AT LEAST A POTENTIAL TO ACCESS A PENETRATING AND INERRANT INSIGHT INTO THEIR OWN EXISTENCE THE TRUE NATURE OF MORALITY THE EXACT DELINEATIONS BETWEEN SELF AND OTHER AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT REDUCE THE EXERCISE DOWN TO THE COMFORTABLE BINARY OF EVASION OR HONESTY

ONCE AGAIN I FIND K'S ANALYSIS TO BE SEPARATED NOT JUST FROM AN EVER-GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO FIND HIS AXIOMS TOO FANTASTICAL TO ACCEPT AT THE OUTSET N THE IRRELIGIOUS AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE NON-CHRISTIAN AND MAYBE WE HAVE TO SORT THE DENOMINATIONS TOO BUT FROM OUR INCREASINGLY SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATIONS OF HOW HUMANS BEHAVE IN THE REAL WORLD AND ALL THE MANY WAYS THAT THEIR COGNITIVE FACULTIES FAIL THEM THEY FAIL IN MEMORY THEY FAIL IN REASON AND THEY FAIL EVEN IN HONEST ATTEMPTS TO AS IS TRUE OF MANY AUTHORS OF AND BEFORE HIS TIME K RELEGATES COGNITIVE FAILINGS TO THE CATEGORY OF THE DEMENTED WHEN TODAY WE JUST PLAIN KNOW BETTER IF ANY COGNITIVE FAILING THAT WOULD DISRUPT K'S MODEL HEREIN IS TO CLASS THE SUFFERER AS DEMENTED THEN WE ARE ALL DEMENTED THAT DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR THE LEGITIMACY OR USEFULNESS OF HIS WORK

HEAVEN FORBID HOWEVER THAT WE TAKE THINGS ONE STEP FURTHER AND SUGGEST THAT THIS INCREASINGLY SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND BEHAVIOR MAY LEAD US TO QUESTION THE VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF A BELIEF IN K'S GOD IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD DEFINITELY GET US KICKED OUT OF THE CHOIR OR DISINVITED FROM THE EARLY SCREENINGS THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH CRITICISM OF THE FILM ITSELF THAT ITS ERSTWHILE AUTHOR WILL TOLERATE BEFORE STEPPING IN TO REMOVE AND REPLACE AUDIENCE MEMBERS

IT SEEMS THAT WHILE K HAD THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO HIDE BEHIND HIS CHOIR HE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE HAVING TO HIDE FROM THE GRIM REALITY OF THE TRUE NATURE AND EXTENT OF HUMAN FALLIBILITY

AS TO HIS MORE GENERAL CLARION CALL TO THIS NOTION OF TRUE INDIVIDUALITY WELL I'LL LET HIM HAVE IT I SUPPOSE SINCE HE DOES AT TIMES SEEM TO BE FLIRTING WITH AN OUGHT RATHER THAN AN IS WHICH IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING I WILL HOWEVER RESERVE THE RIGHT TO RELISH THE IRONY GIVEN HOW HIS APPEAL TO HIS GOD SEEMS TO STRONGLY IMPLY A RIGID MENTAL TEMPLATE INTO WHICH ALL OF HIS FOLLOWERS WILL SOMEHOW MAGICALLY FIT YOU KNOW JUST AS SOON AS THEY STOP LYING TO THEMSELVES
TALD ARISTOTLE BELIEVED THAT PRACTICING HIGH THINKING SPECIFICALLY OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL NATURE IS THE PURPOSE OF LIFE SINCE IT IS A MAIN CHARACTERISTIC THAT SEPARATES US FROM ANIMALS AND PLANTS
FOR LABOR DAY IT'S VALUABLE TO REFLECT ON WHY WE LABOR AND ON HOW LABOR CONTRIBUTES TO HUMAN WELL-BEING

SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO MONTE JOHNSON UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO EXPLORES AN APPROACH TO THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LIFE DEVELOPED BY THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER ARISTOTLE BC ARISTOTLE REASONED THAT JUST AS ARTIFICIAL THINGS SUCH AS TOOLS AND WORKERS HAVE CHARACTERISTIC CAPABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THEY ARE JUDGED TO BE GOOD OR DO WELL SO EACH KIND OF NATURAL THING INCLUDING PLANTS AND HUMANS HAS CHARACTERISTIC CAPABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO WHICH CAN BE JUDGED OBJECTIVELY TO BE GOOD OR DO WELL FOR PLANTS AND ANIMALS THESE MOSTLY HAVE TO DO WITH NUTRITION AND REPRODUCTION AND IN THE CASE OF ANIMALS PLEASURE AND PAIN FOR HUMANS THESE VEGETATIVE AND ANIMAL CAPABILITIES ARE NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT FOR OUR FLOURISHING SINCE REASON AND THE USE OF LANGUAGE ARE THE UNIQUE AND HIGHEST CAPABILITIES OF HUMANS THE CULTIVATION AND EXERCISE OF INTELLECTUAL FRIENDSHIPS AND PARTNERSHIPS MORAL AND POLITICAL VIRTUE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ABOVE ALL THEORETICAL PHILOSOPHY WAS ARGUED BY ARISTOTLE TO BE THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF HUMAN LIFE

PLATO IS MY FRIEND ARISTOTLE IS MY FRIEND BUT MY GREATEST FRIEND IS TRUTH

ISAAC NEWTON
PHILOSOPHER SAYS THE MEANING OF LIFE IS PHILOSOPHY HM
INTERESTING BUT ENTIRELY BASED IN UNSUPPORTABLE ASSUMPTIONS THAT BEINGS HAVE OBJECTIVE PURPOSE WHICH IS TIED TO THEIR DISTINCT QUALITIES

BY THAT ARGUMENT THE PURPOSE OF A PLATYPUS IS TO STAB OTHER ANIMALS WITH ITS VENOMOUS SPURS BECAUSE THE PRESENCE AND USE OF THOSE SPURS IS WHAT SETS A PLATYPUS APART FROM OTHER MAMMALS PLATYPUS EXCELLENCE THEN WOULD BE ACHIEVED BY STABBING OTHER ANIMALS FREQUENTLY AND DEEPLY AND POISONING THEM MOST ACUTELY CAUSING AS MUCH PAIN AS POSSIBLE

THE PURPOSE OF A PLATYPUS ISN'T TO PROCREATE OR SURVIVE
ASSUMING THAT ANYTHING HAS A PURPOSE AT ALL WHICH OF COURSE IS A HUGE ASSUMPTION
WORKING GIVES MY LIFE PURPOSE AND FILLS MY TIME WITH PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY THAT I ONLY HAD TO STUDY LIFE AND MY PLACE IN IT GOING FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL THAT'S WOULD BE THE MOST SATISFYING LIFE ART PHILOSOPHY SCIENCES MUSIC THOSE ARE WHAT MAKES US HUMAN
WHY IS THE UNDERTAKING OF THE FEATURE OR CAPACITY THAT THE ORGANISM HAS WHICH IS UNIQUE TO IT CONSIDERED ITS PURPOSE WHY NOT WHAT THEY ALL SHARE IN COMMON PERHAPS THE CAPACITY THAT NECESSITATES ALL OTHER CAPACITIES IS WORTHY OF THE TITLE OF PURPOSE IN THAT CASE I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT REPRODUCTION IS THE PURPOSE OF ALL LIFE REPRODUCTION IS WHY LIFE EXISTS AND IT IS WHY LIFE CONTINUES TO EXIST IF REPRODUCTION CEASED ALL LIFE ON EARTH WOULD CEASE
OH GOD I AM A VEGETABLE

I LOVE THESE SHORT VIDEOS ON PHILOSOPHY BUT I FIND THE WRITING DISTRACTING FROM THE MESSAGE I READ WHAT THEY WRITE AND MISS WHAT THEY SAY
EXCELLENCE AND THEREFORE HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN PERFORMING ONE S FUNCTION WELL WE SAY THAT A FLUTE PLAYER IS A GOOD FLUTE PLAYER WHEN HE PERFORMS HIS FUNCTION PLAYING THE FLUTE WELL MAN S FUNCTION IS WHAT DISTINGUISHES HIM FROM ALL OTHER BEINGS AND THAT ATTRIBUTE IS HIS RATIONAL ABILITY THUS HAPPINESS IS REASONING WELL OR ACTING RATIONALLY ACCORDING TO VIRTUE I THINK HE MAKES A MISTAKE ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES HUMANNESS
DO THEY HAVE A VIDEO LIKE THIS ON TAKE ABOUT THE PURPOSE OFFLINE
ANYONE KNOW WHAT ARISTOTLE SAID OF THE ERGON OF GODS WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP BEYOND REASONING APPLYING THAT REASON TO THINGS YOU GOVERN PEOPLE ALREADY DO THIS REALLY WHAT DID HE SAY DISTINGUISHED GODS
I SEE PURPOSE IN LIFE AS DOING WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPIEST WITHIN SOCIETY'S PARAMETERS
DOES THOUGHTS ON PURPOSE IN LIFE STRICTLY SAY THAT CONTEMPLATION OF THE UNIVERSE USE OF REASON AND RATIONALITY ARE STRICTLY SPEAKING THE ONLY PURPOSE WE CAN APPLY OURSELVES TO

WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO A CRAFT OR DISCIPLINE FOR EXAMPLE AN ATHLETE WHO HAS FOCUSED HIS LIFE ON TRAINING AND HONING HIS BODY AND MIND FOR THE PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE IN HIS SPORT OR A MUSICIAN WHO STUDIES AND PRACTICES ON HIS INSTRUMENT HAS HE MISSED THE PURPOSE OF LIFE BY FOCUSING HIS ENERGIES ON THESE THINGS INSTEAD OF THE EXERCISE OF RATIONAL THOUGHT

WHAT IS THE BEST VIRTUE ETHICS BOOK IT SEEMS LIKE A JOKE TO ME
THIS IS A LECTURE BY KEVIN SCHARP ON A NEW PROJECT HE CALLS REPLACING PHILOSOPHY THE ABSTRACT IS AS FOLLOWS

FROM FAMILIAR CONCEPTS LIKE TALL AND TABLE TO EXOTIC ONES LIKE GRAVITY AND GENOCIDE THEY GUIDE OUR LIVES AND ARE THE BASIS FOR HOW WE REPRESENT THE WORLD HOWEVER THERE IS GOOD REASON TO THINK THAT MANY OF OUR MOST CHERISHED CONCEPTS LIKE TRUTH FREEDOM KNOWLEDGE AND RATIONALITY ARE DEFECTIVE IN THE SENSE THAT THE RULES FOR USING THEM ARE INCONSISTENT THIS DEFECT LEADS THOSE WHO POSSESS THESE CONCEPTS INTO PARADOXES AND ABSURDITIES INDEED I ARGUE THAT MANY OF THE CENTRAL PROBLEMS OF CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS HAVING THEIR SOURCE IN PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS THAT ARE DEFECTIVE IN THIS WAY IF THAT IS RIGHT THEN WE SHOULD TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN CRAFTING AND SCULPTING OUR CONCEPTUAL REPERTOIRE WE NEED TO EXPLORE VARIOUS WAYS OF REPLACING THESE DEFECTIVE CONCEPTS WITH ONES THAT WILL STILL DO THE WORK WE NEED THEM TO DO WITHOUT LEADING US INTO CONTRADICTIONS

THE HANDOUT FOR THE TALK IS AVAILABLE HERE HETP


PROFESSOR SCHARP WILL ALSO BE DOING AN AMA HERE ON R PHILOSOPHY WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER AT ET PLEASE SEE THIS POST WHERE YOU CAN SUBMIT QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME OR JOIN US WEDNESDAY AT IN WELCOMING PROF SCHARP TO OUR COMMUNITY
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD AGREE THAT CONSISTENCY OR LACK OF DEFECTS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF CONCEPTS

HE SAYS HIMSELF THAT CONCEPTS SHOULD BE REPLACED WHEN THE DEFECT INTERFERES WITH ITS UTILITY BUT CONCEPTS ARE VARIOUSLY USEFUL FOR DIFFERENT THINGS NEAR THE END WHEN DESCRIBING THE PROCESS HE'S PROPOSING HIS FIRST STEP IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CONCEPT IS FOR AND THEN FIGURING OUT IF ITS DEFECTS INTERFERE WITH ITS USE BUT DON'T WE USE THE SAME CONCEPT FOR MANY DIFFERENT USES

ISN'T IT LIKELY THAT A GIVEN CONCEPT OF TRUTH HAS SURVIVED AND THRIVED BECAUSE IT WAS USEFUL THE CONCEPTS WE'VE HELD ONTO AND ARGUED ABOUT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS LIKE TRUTH AND JUSTICE MUST BE USEFUL IN SOME WAYS I SUPPOSE YOU COULD LOOK AT THEM AS MEMES WHICH JUST GOT STUCK IN OUR HEAD BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD AT REPRODUCING THEMSELVES BUT IF THAT WERE THE CASE IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH ARGUING ABOUT THEM OR REPLACING THEM

IT COULD BE THAT THESE IDEAS ARE INCREDIBLY USEFUL IN MANY WAYS WHILE BEING INCONVENIENT IN A FEW WAYS IF THAT'S THE CASE COULDN'T IT BE THAT WE WOULD BE SMART TO CONTINUE USING THOSE CONCEPTS IN ALL THE SCENARIOS WHERE IT'S USEFUL AND ONLY TRY TO REPLACE THEM IN THE CONTEXTS WHERE IT DOESN'T SERVE US

IT SEEMS A LITTLE STRANGE TO ME TO WANT TO THROW OUT THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH FOR BEING INCONSISTENT IT SEEMS TO ASSUME THAT YOU'RE AFTER THE TRUTH YOU ASSUME THAT TRUTH MUST BE CONSISTENT AND THEN USE THAT CONCEPT OF TRUTH TO SAY THAT TRUTH MUST NOT BE TRUE BECAUSE IT'S INCONSISTENT MAYBE THE CONCEPT OF CONSISTENT NEEDS TO BE REWORKED
HAVING ONLY READ THE HANDOUT THE KEY CHALLENGE TO MY MIND IS LANDING ON CONCEPTS WHICH DEFINITIVELY IMPROVE ON THE ONES WE SEEK TO FREE OURSELVES FROM I'M ALL FOR REPLACING PHILOSOPHY WHEN THE WORK CASHES OUT IN FULL BUT HOW ARE WE TO STEAL A WORD TO MEASURE UP THEIR RELATIVE VALUE UNLESS WE AGREE ON SOME OTHER POSSIBLY ARBITRARY YARDSTICK LIKE THIS METROLOGICAL WHEEZE THAT'S THE STEP I WOULD BE MOST WARY OF PUTTING TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON
INTRODUCTION

RALPH WEDGWOOD IS A PHILOSOPHER WHO ASKS QUESTIONS RELATED TO ETHICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY HIS UNCLE WAS CHARLES DARWIN HERE HE DISCUSSES THE NATURE OF METAETHICS AND WHY THE BEST-KNOWN APPROACHES DISSATISFY HIM HOW NORMATIVITY IS TO BE FITTED INTO A NATURALISTIC FRAMEWORK HIS MODERATE NATURALISM WHY NORMATIVITY RAISES ISSUES OF SEMANTICS METAPHYSICS AND EPISTEMOLOGY WHAT MAKES OUGHT STATEMENTS TRUE OR FALSE HOW WE KNOW THE REAL NORMATIVE COMPONENTS OF ACTUALITY HOW TO DEFEND NORMATIVE JUDGMENT INFERNALISM THE NORMATIVITY OF RATIONALITY DEGREES OF RATIONAL THINKING HOW HE DEFENDS HIS VIEW FROM VARIOUS OBJECTIONS WHY REASONS TALK IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE ASSUMED WHETHER RATIONALITY IS A KIND OF VALUE AND THE POINT OF BEING GUIDED BY INTERNAL NORMS AS LATE SUMMER BRINGS US HEAT-WAVE FRESHEN UP ON THIS COOL DISTILLATION

RALPH WEDGWOOD IS A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
AND WE GIVE THEM TO GOODWILL WHEN WE GET NEW SHIT
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO DOES THIS
DID YOU GUYS EVEN READ THE BRICKEN ESSAY

MARX ALSO NOTED THE PERVERSE WAY A COMMODITY COULD IN TURN APPROPRIATE AND IMITATE THE QUALITIES OF A HUMAN BEING AS THOUGH IT POSSESSED A DIABOLICAL LIFE OF ITS OWN CLOTHES REPRESENT THAT AWFUL MIMICRY WITH PARTICULAR ACUITY THINK OF THE SWAGGERING BRAGGADOCIO OF THE NEWEST TRAINERS WITH THEIR SWISHING INSIGNIAS OR THE DRESS THAT SEEMS TO POSSESS ITS OWN FLIRTATIOUS PERSONALITY IN ITS SWING EVEN VERTIGINOUS HEELS THAT SPEAK OF A LANGUOROUS LIFE WITHOUT EXERTION WORLDS AWAY FROM THAT OF THE WORKER WHO MADE THEM SUCH GARMENTS ENTER THE MARKET VIRGINAL AND UNTOUCHED WIPED CLEAN OF THE PRINTS OF THE WORKING HANDS THROUGH WHICH THEY HAVE PASSED

WHEN MARX CONDEMNS THE ALL-CONSUMING COMMODITY FETISHISM OF MODERN CULTURE HE DERIVES THE TERM FROM THE PORTUGUESE FEITIÇO MEANING CHARM OR SORCERY AND REFERRING SPECIFICALLY TO THE WEST AFRICAN PRACTICE OF OBJECT WORSHIP AS WITNESSED BY CENTURY SAILORS TO THE FETISH WORSHIPPERS ATTRIBUTED ALL KINDS OF MAGICAL PROPERTIES THAT SUCH OBJECTS DID NOT POSSESS IN REALITY IN THE SAME WAY MODERN CAPITALISM IT SEEMED TO MARX TRADED ON THE SUPERNATURAL LIFE OF OBJECTS CLOTHES ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM ELICITING THIS FALSE IDOLATRY WE SING THE PRAISES OF SHOES DRESSES JACKETS AND BAGS AS THOUGH THEY POSSESS AN INHERENT POWER A SPIRIT OR SOUL WE GIVE THEM STORIES LIVES IDENTITIES AND IN SO DOING BLOT OUT THEIR REAL ORIGINS

THE AUTHOR ISN'T TAKING ABOUT PEOPLE NAMING THEIR CLOTHES
I THINK THE WAY CURRENT FASHION TRENDS WORK IS THAT EXPENSIVE GOOD TASTE MAKERS DECIDE FOR THE PUBLIC WHAT IS COOL THEN DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH A COMPANY SELLS THAT ITEM FOR IT IS SEEN AS BETTER

SURE SOME PEOPLE WEAR THINGS THEY LIKE BUT IF I SEE SOMEONE WITH A WATCH OR BAG OR SHOES I IMMEDIATELY THINK THEY ARE SMARTER OR MORE INTERESTING THAN SOMEONE WEARING A CHEAPER BRAND EVEN IF THE OVERALL ESTHETIC IS MORE TO MY LIKING

I THINK PEOPLE RESPECT CERTAIN THINGS LIKE GAMERS LIKE SPECIFIC GAMING APPAREL OR PEOPLE HAVE FAVORITE COLORS AND PATTERNS BUT EVERYONE LIKES MONEY

HOW THE HELL DOES ONE DEFINE EPISTEMIC HUMILITY

IT IS MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES IN THIS PAPER BUT NEVER IS A DEFINITION GIVEN
THAT'S A LOT OF BIG FUCKING WORDS

CAN SOMEBODY ENGLISH THIS SHIT FOR ME
AT A BRIEF GLANCE METZINGER EPISTEMIC HUMILITY REMINDED ME OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CHARITY WHICH PRESUMES RATIONALITY RATIONAL ACCOMMODATION AND MEANING MAXIMUM SENSE IN OTHERS

BUT READING FURTHER METZINGER WINDT CONTRAST EPISTEMIC AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND ARGUES THAT EXPERIENCE AS SUCH IS NOT KNOWLEDGE PAGE SO HUMILITY MAY NOT EXTEND TO THOSE WHO ARGUE THAT EXPERIENCE IS FUNDAMENTALLY INTERTWINED WITH KNOWLEDGE AND VICE VERSA SUCH AS WITH PHENOMENOLOGICAL OR IDEALIST PHILOSOPHERS
I THINK THE ARTICLE MAKES SOME SALIENT POINTS COGENTLY IT IS INTENDED FOR A HIGHLY PHILOSOPHICALLY LITERATE AUDIENCE AND THEREFORE SUSPECT IT WILL DO LITTLE AS A TOOL FOR SPREADING OPEN-MINDEDNESS AS IT IS DELIBERATELY INACCESSIBLE TO ALL BUT THE PHILOSOPHICAL ELITE I LAMENT THAT IT IS NOT WRITTEN IN A MORE ACCESSIBLE VERNACULAR IN OTHER WORDS WRITING THIS KINDA STUFF SO THAT REGULAR PEOPLE DON'T GET TURNED OFF BY BIG WORDS THAT LESS THAN ONE IN PEOPLE KNOW OR USE DOES NOT DO ANY GOOD OUTSIDE OF THE IVORY TOWER AND THAT'S A SHAME

IS SPECIFICITY ALWAYS PRESENTED AS A NECESSARY PART OF INTELLECTUALISM

DOESN'T SPECIFICITY IGNORE A FUTILITY IN THE RIGIDITY OF DEFINITION

IT SEEMS THAT SPECIFICS WERE WHAT I LEARNED IN WORKBOOKS AS A CHILD AND THE REST OF MY LEARNING WAS TO COMPLICATE THAT AND TO SHOW THE VARIOUS WAYS IN WHICH THE SPECIFICS FAULTER

ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT I AM REELING AT THE PRETENTIOUSNESS OF USING SO MANY SUPERFLUOUS WORDS TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING SO SIMPLE I CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH AT THE IRONY THAT THIS DOUCHE PROFESSOR PROMOTES HUMILITY BUT HAS HIS HEAD SO FIRMLY PLANTED UP HIS OWN ASS

STEP ONE TO HUMILITY STOP TRYING TO JUSTIFY YOUR SIMPLISTIC INSIGHTS BY ATTEMPTING TO BE A HUMAN THESAURUS WRITE YOUR IDEAS IN PLAIN ENGLISH IF THEY DON'T SEEM PARTICULARLY INSIGHTFUL YOU NEED TO REEVALUATE IF WHAT YOU'VE COME UP WITH IS WORTH SHARING OR NEEDS MORE WORK

THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST RIDICULOUSLY CONVOLUTED PHRASES I'VE EVER HEARD IF YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN SOMETHING WITH COMMON WORDS YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT MATTER
WELL THIS IS A DEFINITION OF OPEN MINDEDNESS THAT YOU CHOOSE IF YOU WANT THE TERM TO REFER TO AN EPISTEMIC VIRTUE BUT REALLY WHEN PEOPLE USE IT IN EVERYDAY LIFE IT MEANS INDECISIVENESS
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D HEAR AS AN EXCUSE TO AVOID CRITICISM USED TYPICALLY BY THESE NEW AGE PSEUDO MYSTIC TYPES SIMILAR TO SAYING DON'T BE NEGATIVE
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SCIENTISM IN PEOPLE PROMOTED VERY THINKING IN PEOPLE I FIND THAT SOME PEOPLE VENERATE SCIENCE AND ALL ITS WONDERS UNQUESTIONABLY LIKE NO ITS TRUE THERE WAS A SCIENTIFIC STUDY THIS IS FUNNY BECAUSE A GREAT DEAL OF SCIENCE IS ALL ABOUT QUESTIONING YOUR ASSUMPTIONS WITHIN REASON AT THE SAME TIME OTHERS COMPLETELY DISMISS FINDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ROBUSTLY REDUNDANT
I LIKE THIS PIECE BUT IT MIGHT BE PREACHING TO THE CONVERTED WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO MAKE THESE POINTS SALIENT AND COMPELLING TO AN UNWITTING VICTIM OF SCIENTISM WHO ONLY KNOWS THAT BILL NYE IS GENERALLY TO BE TRUSTED AND DOESN'T LOOK MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OR NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCIENTIFIC AND SCIENTISTIC

I SUGGEST WE NEED A BIT MORE AWARENESS OF THE ROLE FACTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO PLAY IN AUTHORITY GAMES IN THE LAST HALF CENTURY OR SO WE'VE SHIFTED TOWARDS POLICY AND AWAY FROM ALL FORMS OF POLITICAL IDEALISM EXCEPT FOR SOME SMALL NATIONALISMS LIKE SNP

SCIENCE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY THE LANGUAGE OF POLITICAL STRUGGLES THINK FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT THE FOCUS ON FACTS IN THE ARGUMENT OVER WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD DEPOSE SADDAM HUSSEIN INSTEAD OF A BATTLE IN DEFENCE OF THIS OR THAT POLITICAL PRINCIPLE IT BECAME A BATTLE OF EVIDENCE OF ALIX VS DODGY DOSSIER

THIS IS A STRAND IN WESTERN CULTURE THAT DEEPLY INFLUENCES HOW YOUNGER PEOPLE UNDERSTAND SCIENCE AS A LOCUS OF AUTHORITY IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THAT IT CAN BECOME QUASI-RELIGIOUS FOR MANY ALMOST WITHOUT CONSCIOUS THOUGHT
I FIND MYSELF AWFULLY SUSPICIOUS OF AN ATTEMPT TO EXPOSE THE ERRORS OF SOMETHING THAT WHEN THE PROPERTIED TAKEDOWN DOESN'T QUOTE THE PEOPLE WHOSE ERRORS THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO EXPOSE OR EVEN ADDRESS SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS NOT HAVING READ EVERYTHING MUST GO I CANNOT SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT THIS IS MISREPRESENTING IT BUT I'M NOT TERRIBLY INCLINED TO TAKE WORD THAT IT IS FOUNDED ON MISUNDERSTANDINGS OF SCIENCE

PSYCHOLOGIZING ONES OPPONENTS AND ACCUSING THEM OF ZEALOTRY FOR DISAGREEING WITH YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PLACE IN PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY MUCH ALL THAT IAN KIDD IS INTERESTED IN HERE
SCIENCE IS A METHOD OF EXAMINING FACTS AND EVIDENCE AND USING OUR BEST REASONING TO ARRIVE AT THE CURRENT BEST VIEW OF THE WINDOW OF REALITY BEEN EXAMINED

SCIENTISM IS THE BELIEF THAT IDEAS FACTS AND FIGURES DERIVED FROM SCIENCE IS INFALLIBLE AND SHOULD BE RESPECTED ABOVE ALL ELSE IN EFFECT SCIENCE AS DOGMA OR SCIENCE AS A RELIGION

THE PROBLEM WITH SCIENTISM IS THAT IT RUNS CONTRARY TO SCIENCE ITSELF BY ASSUMING INFALLIBILITY IT PREVENTS US FROM RECOGNIZING WHEN OUR BEST UNDERSTANDING SHOULD CHANGE

EVEN MORE PROBLEMATICALLY IS THAT BY READING SCIENCE ONE CAN FALL PREY TO ITS DASTARDLY COUSIN THE TWO AFTER ALL LOOK SIMILAR TO UNTRAINED EYES WITH MIMICKING THE VENEER AND PASTICHE OF SCIENCE SO AS TO PREY UPON THE SCIENTISM THAT IS BROADLY ACCEPTED IN OUR MODERN AGE

HOWEVER OTHER PHILOSOPHERS OF SCIENCE SUCH AS IMRE LAKATOS AND THOMAS KUHN SOON POINTED OUT THAT POPPER S FALSIFICATION DOESN T ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE WAY ALL SCIENCE IS DONE

CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN WHAT THEY ACTUALLY POINTED OUT

ALSO WHY DO SO MANY PHILOSOPHERS WRITE ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENTISM BUT ALMOST NO SCIENTISTS WRITE ABOUT THE PRETENTIOUSNESS OF PHILOSOPHY IT SEEMS PREPOSTEROUS TO ME THAT THE DESIGNATED OPPONENTS OF PHILOSOPHY HAVE TO BE DUMBASS POPULARIZATIONS OF SCIENCE LIKE NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON OR BILL NYE AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE UNLIKE MOST PHILOSOPHERS MOST SCIENTISTS JUST DO NOT GIVE A DAMN
CAN EVERYONE STOP SHITTING ON CRASH COURSE IT'S IN THE NAME GUYS IT'S A CRASH COURSE NOT AN EXPANSIVE AND COMPLETE EXPLANATION ON THE WHOLE OF LINGUISTICS IT'S A TASTER TO GIVE THE GENERAL YOUTUBE VIEWER A BRAIN TEASE AND TO SIMPLY PRESENT THE COMPLEXITIES OF LANGUAGE
TODAY I SAW AN IMAGE OF A PARROT LOOKING AT A AHOM AHOM AND IT WAS UNCANNY
TO BE BLUNT THIS VIDEO IS VERY BAD IT RANGES FROM OUTRIGHT ERRORS TO MISLEADING STATEMENTS TO OVERLY VAGUE IT ISN'T JUST WRONG ABOUT THINGS AND IT IS OFTEN ENOUGH YOU STILL WON'T BE ABLE TO LEARN MUCH OF ANYTHING ABOUT IT I HAPPENED TO HAVE GIVEN AN OVERVIEW OF ITS MANY SHORTCOMINGS ELSEWHERE ON REDDIN WHEN GIVING AN EXAMPLE OF WHY CRASH COURSE PHILOSOPHY VIDEOS ARE OFTEN VERY BAD

ABSTRACT

ADVOCATES OF EXPRESSIVISM ABOUT BASICALLY ANY KIND OF LANGUAGE ARE BY ABANDONING A TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO SEMANTIC THEORIZING IN FAVOR OF AN OR DYNAMIC APPROACH OR SO THIS PAPER ARGUES THE TYPE OF DYNAMIC APPROACH DEVELOPED HERE IN CONTRAST TO THE APPROACH IS ARGUED TO YIELD CANONICAL IF NOT STRICTLY CLASSICAL EXPLANATIONS OF THE CORE SEMANTIC PROPERTIES OF THE CONNECTIVES THE CASES ON WHICH I FOCUS MOST HERE ARE NEGATION AND DISJUNCTION I END THE PAPER BY DESCRIBING A DISTINCTIVE SENSE IN WHICH MENTAL STATES MIGHT PLAY A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THE PRACTICE OF SEMANTIC THEORIZING AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND I CONNECT THIS TO A DISTINCTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE PRAGMATIC FUNCTION OF EAST G A NORMATIVELY LADEN CLAIM IN DISCOURSE

NATE CARLOW ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO
CAN ANYBODY TELL ME IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN AMPLIATIVE ARGUMENT AND AN INDUCTIVE ONE ARE THEY THE SAME THING
I THINK EVERYONE IN THE WORLD SHOULD BE TAUGHT CRITICAL THINKING IN GRADESCHOOL AS A REQUIREMENT TO GRADUATE
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS FANTASTIC CHANNEL AS SOMEONE WITH AN ENGINEERING AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND I MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT THESE TOPICS IN SCHOOL AND NOW FEEL I'VE BEEN INTELLECTUALLY LIBERATED BY YOUR VIDEOS I'VE COME TO BELIEVE THAT OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON STEM TO THE EXCLUSION OF PHILOSOPHY STARVES THE SOUL ALSO IT'S FUN TO REVISIT AND REFER FRIENDS TO ONE OF YOUR RELEVANT VIDEOS WHEN WE'RE DEBATING A TOPIC THANKS AGAIN AND THANK YOU ARISTOTLE
LOGIC SHOULD BE A REQUIRED COURSE AT SOME POINT OF EDUCATION WHAT BETTER TOOL TO SHARPEN THAN THE BRAIN
IT FEELS LIKE THE GUY MADE A WHOLE VIDEO JUST TO BE AN ARGUMENT FOR HIS WIFE WHO SAYS MONTY WON'T BE AT THE PARTY BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM AND SHE WANTS TO HAVE GOOD TIME

SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO GEOFF LYNN NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY GETS YOU STARTED ON THE CRITICAL THINKING JOURNEY HE TELLS YOU WHAT CRITICAL THINKING IS WHAT AN ARGUMENT IS AND WHAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A DEDUCTIVE AND AN AMPLIATIVE ARGUMENT IS

WIPHI
NEAT VIDEO IT REMINDS ME OF AN OLD YOUTUBER NAMED QUALIASOUP WHO DID VERY NICELY ILLUSTRATED VIDEOS ON A LOT OF INTERESTING TOPICS HE ALSO DID A VIDEO ON CRITICAL THINKING
ALTHOUGH I AGREE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD ARGUMENT ISN'T THE COLLUSION FROM THE MONTY RARELY GOES TO PARTIES ARGUMENT WRONG

YOU COULD SAY THAT THE PREMISES MAKE IT A PROBABLE CONCLUSION BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO SAY MONTY PROBABLY WON'T BE AT THE PARTY

I THINK THAT SAYING HE WON'T BE THERE IS HARMFUL AND A WRONG CONCLUSION AS THAT WOULD IMPLY PEOPLE WILL MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON CERTAINTY RATHER THAN PROBABILITY THUS POTENTIALLY LEADING TO UNWANTED OUTCOMES

I'D RATHER CALL IT AN ARGUMENT THAT IS ALMOST GOOD DEPENDING ON THE SETTING RATHER THAN GOOD
THE DEDUCTIVE ARGUMENT WOULDN'T ONE HAVE TO ESTABLISH THAT THE PARTY WILL BE HELD IN LESS THAN AN AFTERNOON'S TIME THE STATED TRAVEL TIME FROM BEIJING FROM NOW

IF ANYTHING I AM DRAWN TO THE POSITION AFTER SURVEYING OVER YEARS OF ATTEMPTS TO VINDICATE MORALITY AND FORMING THE OPINION THAT IT IS ALL BEST DESCRIBED WITH THE PHRASE DESPERATE SCRABBLING

AND FOR A WHILE I THOUGHT I WAS ALONE IN FEELING THIS WAY IT'S SO REFRESHING TO SEE IT IN PRINTING
I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS WAS POSTED ITS A PAPER AT THE END OF A LONG AND SEEMINGLY PERSONAL DISPUTE WITH ARCANE DETAILS IN PREVIOUS BOOKS AND PAPERS RELIED UPON

I MEAN ITS INTERESTING TO READ FOR THE LEVEL OF APPARENT ANNOYANCE WHICH IS A WELCOME STYLISTIC RELIEF BUT ITS A REALLY WEIRD PAPER TO CHOOSE
WHEN BOOKS OR PICTURES IN REPRODUCTION ARE THROWN ON THE MARKET CHEAPLY AND ATTAIN HUGE SALES THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE NATURE OF THE OBJECTS IN QUESTION BUT THEIR NATURE IS AFFECTED WHEN THESE OBJECTS THEMSELVES ARE CHANGED REWRITTEN CONDENSED DIGESTED REDUCED TO KITSCH IN REPRODUCTION OR IN PREPARATION FOR THE MOVIES THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT CULTURE SPREADS TO THE MASSES BUT THAT CULTURE IS BEING DESTROYED IN ORDER TO YIELD ENTERTAINMENT

THE RESULT OF THIS IS NOT DISINTEGRATION BUT DECAY AND THOSE WHO ACTIVELY PROMOTE IT ARE NOT THE TIN PAN ALLEY COMPOSERS BUT A SPECIAL KIND OF INTELLECTUALS OFTEN WELL READ AND WELL INFORMED WHOSE SOLE FUNCTION IS TO ORGANIZE DISSEMINATE AND CHANGE CULTURAL OBJECTS IN ORDER TO PERSUADE THE MASSES THAT HAMLET CAN BE AS ENTERTAINING AS MY FAIR LADY AND PERHAPS EDUCATIONAL
AS WELL THERE ARE MANY GREAT AUTHORS OF THE PAST WHO HAVE SURVIVED CENTURIES OF OBLIVION AND NEGLECT BUT IT IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE AN ENTERTAINING VERSION OF WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY
I'VE JUST STARTED READING IT AND I CAN ALREADY SEE IT IT'S FUNNY TO THAT IT SEEMS TO MAKE ME WANA KEEP A JOURNAL NOW
SOUNDS LIKE GEORGE ORWELL AND IT'S TRUE
ONE COMMENT JACQUES DERRID ONCE VISITED JAPAN AND HELD A DISCUSSION WITH KORIN KARATANI AND ABADA AKIRA

THE CRITIC HINOKI AZUSA HAS AN INTEREST IN THE KYOTO SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY AND WROTE A BOOK ON DERRID

TAKE AWAY FROM THAT WHAT YOU WILLIAM
I SHOULD CORRECT YOU AND THIS MIGHT SEEM WORD IS NOT RECONSTRUCTIONISM IT'S DECONSTRUCTION BUT THE POINT IS LESS PEDANTIC THAN IT SEEMS BECAUSE ISMS ARE POINTS OF VIEW IDEOLOGIES BELIEF SYSTEMS ETC SO THE USAGE OF THIS TERM CAN OBSCURE WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED DECONSTRUCTION REFERS EITHER TO A STRATEGY FOR READING TEXTS OR THE STRUCTURE IN THOSE TEXTS THAT MAKES THIS STRATEGY POSSIBLE COMPARE THE WORD BIOLOGY WHICH REFERS TO THE STRATEGIES BIOLOGISTS HAVE FOR OBSERVING THE BIOLOGY OF LIVING BEINGS
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT FOR DERRID THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF EVER REACHING SOME KIND OF GROUND ZERO STATE CHARACTERIZED BY UNMEDIATED PRESENCE OF BEING THE ABSOLUTE ZEN BUDDHISM IS AGNOSTIC AT BEST ON THIS POINT OR ONTOTHEOLOGICAL AT WORST DEPENDING ON WHICH TEXTS YOU ARE LOOKING AT RHETORICAL PLOYS AGAINST REASON WERE NEVER AS STRINGENT AS RHETORIC AGAINST DISCURSIVE ANALYTICAL COGNITION BECAUSE FOR DERRID THE SEDIMENTATION OF REPRESENTATION IS SUCH THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF SIMPLE STEPPING OUTSIDE OF IT OR WINNOWING IT DOWN DECONSTRUCTION IS NOT A SIMPLE REJECTION OR NEGATION

BOOK DESCRIPTION

I PROPOSE A THEORY OF THE NATURE AND LOGIC OF TRUTH ON WHICH TRUTH IS AN INCONSISTENT CONCEPT THAT SHOULD BE REPLACED FOR CERTAIN THEORETICAL PURPOSES THE BOOK OPENS WITH AN OVERVIEW OF WORK ON THE NATURE OF TRUTH EAST G CORRESPONDENCE THEORIES DEFLATIONIST WORK ON THE LIAR AND RELATED PARADOXES AND A COMPREHENSIVE SCHEME FOR COMBINING THESE TWO LITERATURES INTO A UNIFIED STUDY OF THE CONCEPT TRUTH TRUTH IS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS AN INCONSISTENT CONCEPT AND I PROPOSE A DETAILED THEORY OF INCONSISTENT CONCEPTS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO THE CASE OF TRUTH TRUTH ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A USEFUL CONCEPT BUT ITS INCONSISTENCY INHIBITS ITS UTILITY AS SUCH IT SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH CONSISTENT CONCEPTS THAT CAN DO TRUTH S JOB WITHOUT GIVING RISE TO PARADOXES I OFFER A PAIR OF REPLACEMENTS WHICH I DUB ASCENDING TRUTH AND DESCENDING TRUTH ALONG WITH AN AXIOMATIC THEORY OF THEM AND A NEW KIND OF SEMANTICS FOR THIS THEORY AS FOR THE NATURE OF TRUTH I DEVELOP DAVIDSON S IDEA THAT IT IS BEST UNDERSTOOD AS THE CORE OF A MEASUREMENT SYSTEM FOR RATIONAL PHENOMENA EAST G BELIEF DESIRE AND MEANING THE BOOK FINISHES WITH A SEMANTIC THEORY THAT TREATS TRUTH PREDICATES AS I EAST THEIR EXTENSION IS RELATIVE TO A CONTEXT OF ASSESSMENT AND DEMONSTRATION OF HOW THIS THEORY SOLVES THE PROBLEMS POSED BY THE LIAR AND OTHER PARADOXES
FROM THE TEXT

DAVIDSONIAN THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN AXIOMATIC THEORY DAVIDSON PREFERS A TARSKIAN AXIOMATIC THEORY AND THAT THEORY IS GIVEN EMPIRICAL INTERPRETATION AS PART OF AN OVERALL THEORY OF A RATIONAL AGENT'S BELIEFS DESIRES AND MEANINGS VIEWS ON THE RELATION BETWEEN TRUTH AND MEANING HAVE BEEN VERY INFLUENTIAL BUT DEFENDERS OF HIS VIEWS ON WHAT CONSTITUTES AN ACCEPTABLE THEORY OF TRUTH ARE HARD TO FIND THIS BOOK ENDORSES SOMETHING LIKE A DAVIDSONIAN VIEW ON THE NATURE OF TRUTH IN CHAPTERS AND

THE MOST INTERESTING AXIOMATIC APPROACH TO TRUTH COMES FROM BRUNO DE FIORETTI IN HIS SUBJECTIVE BAYESIAN PROBABILITY IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT DAVIDSON BEFORE HE BECAME A PHILOSOPHER WAS USING BAYESIAN PROBABILITY AND DAVIDSON IS USING BAYESIAN PROBABILITY FOR HIS APPROACH TO TRUTH AND TRIANGULATION ALTHOUGH NOT DE VERSION BUT VERSION TO ME VIEW ON TRUTH IS STRENGTHENED WHEN YOU REPLACE APPROACH TO BAYESIAN PROBABILITY WITH DE
THIS WHOLE ARGUMENT MISSES THE POINT EVEN IF IRAN DID BLOW UP A SINGLE CITY WHAT SHOULD THE RESPONSE BE THAT IS WHERE A LOT OF MORAL ARGUMENT START THESE AUTHORS TAKE IT AS THE ENDPOINT AS IF THE OPTIONS ARE OBVIOUS AND THEREFORE NO DISCUSSION IS REQUIRED

ITS EASY TO SAY YOU'D DROP A HYDROGEN BOMB ON TEHRAN BUT THINK ABOUT IT WHO WOULD YOU BE KILLING WOULD YOU TAKE OUT JUST THAT CITY WHAT IF THEY HAD ANOTHER MISSILE SAY THEIR BOMB WAS A CRAPPY FEW KILOTON BOMB WOULD YOU RETALIATE WITH A TON HYDROGEN BOMB WHAT IF YOU COULD ONLY SUSPECT THAT IRAN WAS BEHIND IT SMUGGLED IN A CONTAINER SAY IT TAKES A MONTH TO TRACE IT AND EVEN WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE X CERTAINTY GIVEN ALL OF THESE SCENARIO'S IS CONVENTIONAL PRE-EMPTION JUSTIFIED IF YOU DON'T ACT WILL IT BE SEEN AS A MORAL FAILURE NOT TO STOP IT HOW DOES PRE-EMPTION SQUARE WITH THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL NARRATIVE AND MYTHOLOGY WOULD WE STILL BE THE AMERICA WE WANT TO BE

I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS BUT IT SEEMS THESE PROVIDE MUCH MORE RELEVANT PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES
STRAWMAN ALERT
REMOVED
THAT IS A VERY LONG WINDED ARTICLE WHEN THE AUTHOR COULD HAVE EXPLAINED THEIR POSITION MUCH MORE CLEARLY IN TWO SENTENCES THEY BELIEVE THAT THERE EXISTS A SET OF OBJECTIVE ABSOLUTE MORAL VALUES 2 THEY BELIEVE THAT MORALITY AND MORAL VALUES ARE DERIVED FROM THE HUMAN SOUL
IN RESPONSE TO THOSE WHO ARE DISCUSSING POSITION ON FREE WILL AND DETERMINISM A QUOTE DIRECTLY FROM HARRIS WHICH I INCLUDED IN THE ARTICLE CLEARLY EXPLAINS HIS POSITION

THIS NEUROSCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING REVEALS YOU TO BE A BIOCHEMICAL PUPPET OUR THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS EMERGE FROM BACKGROUND CAUSES OF WHICH WE ARE UNAWARE AND OVER WHICH WE EXERT NO CONSCIOUS CONTROL HARRIS IN THE BIBLE SAMUEL FREE WILLIAM SIMON AND SCHUSTER

TRYING TO RECONCILE ANY FORM OF AUTHENTIC CHOICE INTO THIS POSITION WOULD BE AS IT IS SAID AN ATTEMPT TO HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO

ONE OF REASONS FOR DENYING FREE WILL IS THE NOTION THAT NEUROBIOLOGICAL IMPULSES CAN BE DETECTED PRIOR TO PHYSICAL ACTION AS IF THIS SOMEHOW PROVES DETERMINISM TO BE TRUE THIS LINE OF THINKING IS FALLACIOUS AS CORRELATION DOES NOT PROVE CAUSATION THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT THE NEURAL IMPULSE WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ACTION ONLY THAT IT CAN BE CORRELATED WITH PRIOR TO THE ACTION I CAN JUST AS EASILY SAY THAT MY FREE WILL CAUSED THE NEURAL IMPULSE WHICH CAUSED THE ACTION AGAIN HE IS UTILIZING MATERIALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS TO PROVE THAT MATERIALISM IS TRUE WHICH IS ALSO CIRCULAR REASONING
AS AN ASIDE IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT OF COURSE HARRIS WOULD ARGUE THAT BELIEVING IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL IS ENTIRELY SCIENTIFICALLY UNVERIFIABLE WHICH IS CERTAINLY TRUE I WOULD ARGUE HOWEVER THAT RELYING ON A SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION FOR SUCH MATTERS IS ENTIRELY REDUCTIONISTIC AND MISAPPLIED EVEN THOSE SO FERVENTLY BOUND TO THEIR VIEW OF SCIENTISM CANNOT REASON WITHOUT BEING INCONSISTENT WITH THAT VERY BELIEF ARE LAWS OF LOGIC SCIENTIFICALLY DETECTABLE LAWS OF NATURE MATHEMATICS

HERE IS THE FLAW FATAL TO THE CRITIQUE THE AUTHOR OF THIS CRITIQUE MISTAKES A PROPERTY FOR AN OBJECT

I HAVE HERE IN MY HAND A BOOK THE BOOK IS CLOSED I CAN DETECT A BOOK BUT I CANNOT DETECT A CLOSED WITHOUT REFERENCE TO SOME OBJECT TO WHICH THAT PROPERTY APPLIES THE LAWS OF LOGIC AND NATURE ARE LIKE THAT THEY ARE PROPERTIES TO POSTULATE THE EXISTENCE OF A PROPERTY IS ERRONEOUS PROPERTIES ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE STATE OF AN OBJECT THEY DO NOT EXIST AS SUCH

THE ASIDE THAT THE AUTHOR POSITS IN CRITIQUE IS A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING THAT CAUSES HER TO FAIL IN HER GRASP OF THE CONCEPT OF HARRIS MATERIALISTIC MORALISM THE ASIDE IS ACTUALLY THE IN THE ARGUMENT EVERYTHING BUILT AROUND THIS IS BUILT THEREFORE AROUND AN ERROR
REMOVED
WHY DOES HARRIS NOTION OF MORALITY GET SO MUCH ATTENTION HERE AREN'T THE FLAWS OF HIS THEORY OBVIOUS AND BEATEN TO DEATH

FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF VALUES IN HIS MORAL ONTOLOGY HIS NOTION OF WELL-BEING IS ARBITRARY IT RESORTS TO AN UNJUSTIFIED PRIORITIZATION OF THE WELL-BEING OF ONE PARTICULAR SPECIES ABOVE AND BEYOND ALL OTHERS MOREOVER THERE'S CLEARLY A CONFLATION OF THE KINDS OF VALUES ON HARRIS MORAL THEORIZING MORAL GOODS ARE NOT THE SAME AS PRAGMATIC GOODS A CONFLATION THAT PERVADES HIS WORK

AS TO NORMATIVITY IN HIS MORAL ONTOLOGY HIS ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM UTTERLY FAILS JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE FACTS ABOUT WHAT PRODUCES GOOD AND EVIL DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE VALUES WE ASCRIBE TO THEM WHY IMPOSE GOODS AND EVILS ON THESE FACTS AT ALL THIS ONE WAS REALLY BAD FROM HIM

FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MORAL EPISTEMOLOGY IF SCIENCE HAS ALL THE ANSWERS THEN WHAT DO WE MAKE OF OUR MORAL INTUITIONS ARE THEY ALL WRONG ARE EPIPHENOMENA IF OUR MORAL INTUITIONS ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES ISN'T THE ROLE OF SCIENCE RELEGATED TO MERELY TO PROVIDE WAYS TO MAXIMIZE OR OPTIMIZE THE PURSUIT OF WELL-BEING HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER MORAL THEORY EVEN A THEORY AS OPPOSED TO HARRIS PERSPECTIVE AS DIVINE COMMAND THEORY WHICH CAN AFFIRM THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE VIA SCIENCE TO MAXIMIZE AND OPTIMIZE OUR CONFORMITY TO ETHICS THAT ARE DIVINELY INSPIRED

IS THERE REALLY ANYTHING MORE TO SAY THERE
I THINK THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE AUTHOR MODELS PEOPLE AS RATIONAL AGENTS RATHER THAN EVOLVED ONES IF YOU JUST KEEP TWO THINGS IN MIND

BRAINS EVOLVED TO MAXIMIZE SURVIVAL BY ACCURATELY PREDICTING HOW WE SHOULD ACT IN THE KIND OF SITUATIONS OUR ANCESTORS ENCOUNTERED

2 EVOLUTION MAXIMIZES SURVIVAL OF YOUR GENES WHICH HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF BEING FOUND IN YOUR CLOSE RELATIVES TOO

THEN THESE SUPPOSED PARADOXES ALL MAKE COMPLETE SENSE

WITHIN THE PHILOSOPHY OF NATURALISM THERE IS NO FOUNDATION FOR ACCEPTING THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE

WHY DO WE AS HUMAN BEINGS HAVE CONCERN FOR OTHER BEINGS

WHY DO VALUES EXIST IN AN AMORAL WORLD OF MATTER CHANCE AND PURPOSELESS DETERMINISM WHICH HARRIS S MATERIALISTIC NATURALISTIC WORLD-VIEW IS BOUND TO

WHY DO WE HAVE MORAL CONCERNS AT ALL IN THE FIRST PLACE OR CONCERNS ABOUT ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER

I FULLY ADMIT LOOSELY SPEAKING IT IS NATURAL FOR US TO BELIEVE THAT ALL LIVING BEINGS IN FACT DO SHARE TO DIFFERENT EXTENTS MODES OF SENTIENCE AND I WOULD AGREE THAT THEY DO BUT WHY DO WE NATURALLY HOLD THIS POSITION AS FACT

LOGICALLY WE MUST ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT THERE EXISTS A UNIFORMITY TO NATURE NOT ONLY THROUGH TIME BUT ALSO ACROSS LIVING THINGS IN VARIOUS FORMS AND DEGREES IN ORDER TO ALLOW THIS EVIDENCE TO SPEAK TO US IF YOU WILLIAM BUT HOW IS THIS EXPLAINED UNDER A NATURALISTIC WORLD-VIEW WHERE THERE IS NO REAL FOUNDATION TO TRUST THE CONSISTENCY OF THE LAWS OF NATURE

ARE LAWS OF LOGIC SCIENTIFICALLY DETECTABLE LAWS OF NATURE MATHEMATICS CERTAINLY NOT BUT WE DO NOT DOUBT THEIR EXISTENCE

ARGUMENTATION WOULD NEVER BE RECOGNIZABLY COHERENT OR CONSISTENT WITH REALITY IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY BECAUSE ATOMS ALONE NO MATTER HOW THEY RE ARRANGED ARE NOT NORMATIVELY HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO ADHERE TO LAWS OF LOGIC AND RATIONALITY ONLY TO DETERMINISTIC LAWS OF CHEMISTRY

IF WHAT IS GOOD FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IS ALWAYS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT IS RIGHT HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN DECISIONS OF SELF-SACRIFICE IN ORDER TO SAVE THE LIFE OF ANOTHER BEING

WHILE WHAT IS GOOD FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IS SUBJECTIVE TO THAT INDIVIDUAL WE ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS RIGHT RISES ABOVE SUBJECTIVE GOODNESS
I'M ALWAYS SHOCKED TO SEE ANYTHING ABOUT SAM HARRIS AFTER HIS GOOF WITH NOAM CHOMSKY
SUCH COMPONENTS ONLY TELL US THAT PAIN CAN BE CAUSED THAT A BEING OF INTEREST IS CONSCIOUS OF SUCH PAIN BUT NEVER WHY WROUGHT TO SPARE SOMEONE PAIN OR INJUSTICE OR WHY WE OUGHT TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF OTHER CONSCIOUS BEINGS OR WHY A BEING OF INTEREST IS OF INTEREST IN THE FIRST PLACE

MORALITY CAN BE VIEWED AS AN INHERENT ALTRUISM GIVEN TO US BY EVOLUTION I E WE HAVE AN INSTINCT TOWARDS MORALITY AND WE HAVE THAT INSTINCT BECAUSE IT'S USEFUL FOR THE PROPAGATION OF OUR GENES THE QUESTION WHY WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT SUFFERING IS IRRELEVANT BECAUSE WE DO CARE WHETHER WE WANT TO OR NOT HARRIS PROPOSAL IS THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THE MINIMIZING OF SUFFERING AS THE COMMON GOAL OF THESE IMPULSES OF MORALITY AND AT THAT POINT SCIENCE TAKES OVER AND INFORMS US HOW BEST TO GO ABOUT THAT HARRIS CLAIMS THAT SCIENCE CAN TELL US WHAT WE OUGHT TO VALUE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE WELLBEING NOT WHY WE CARE TO BEGIN WITH THAT IS ALREADY EXPLAINED BY EVOLUTION
IS SAM HARRIS CONSIDERED A SERIOUS PHILOSOPHER WORTHY OF DISCUSSION THESE DAYS
I'M NOT SURE THE AUTHOR REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT SAM HARRIS IS SAYING HIS VIEW IS FAIRLY SIMPLE YET SO MANY FAIL TO GRASP IT HE'S PRECISELY SAYING THAT WE NEED TO PRESUME A CERTAIN GOAL EAST G WELLBEING HUMAN FLOURISHING IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT MORALITY
WHERE DOES THAT GOAL COME FROM I THINK HE ATTEMPTS TO FIND THE IMPLICIT GOALS OF OTHER MORAL CODES WE TAKE FOR GRANTED A BIT LIKE WE STRIVE FOR CURING PEOPLE IN MEDICINE RATHER THAN KILLING THEM IT'S NOT A FULLY DEFINED GOAL BUT WITHOUT ONE ANY OTHER DISCUSSION WOULD BE MEANINGLESS

HOWEVER IF THIS IS THE CASE IF WHAT IS GOOD FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IS ALWAYS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT IS RIGHT HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN DECISIONS OF SELF-SACRIFICE IN ORDER TO SAVE THE LIFE OF ANOTHER BEING

THIS IS ANOTHER MISUNDERSTANDING SAM HARRIS NEVER PRIORITIES WHAT IS GOOD FOR AN INDIVIDUAL HE WOULD ARGUE SELF-SACRIFICE CAN MOVE HUMANITY FURTHER UP TOWARDS ONE OF THE LOCAL OPTIMA OF FLOURISHING

THE AUTHOR DOES NOT SIMPLY ADDRESS SAM HARRIS BY THE WAY I CAN SEE A FAIRLY UNGROUNDED ATTACK AGAINST NATURALISM IN GENERAL
ALSO WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM

ARE LAWS OF LOGIC SCIENTIFICALLY DETECTABLE LAWS OF NATURE MATHEMATICS CERTAINLY NOT BUT WE DO NOT DOUBT THEIR EXISTENCE WHY IS THAT IT IS BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY EVER MAKE SENSE OF REALITY BY POSITING THEIR EXISTENCE

WHAT'S THE POINT OF EPISTEMOLOGY IF NOT TO DETECT THE LAWS OF LOGIC RUSSEL AND GDEL WOULD DEFINITELY LOVE TO HAVE A WORD ABOUT THAT THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE PRECISELY THE POINT OF SCIENTIFIC DEBATE
EVEN MORE TECHNICALLY WE MUST ADMIT THAT THERE IS AN INHERENT FLAW IN HARRIS S PARTICULAR VIEW THAT SENTIENCE IS FACT THAT IS WHEN WE EXTRAPOLATE SENTIENCE TO OTHER LIVING BEINGS BESIDE OURSELVES THIS DILEMMA IS ONLY PROBLEMATIC UNDER A PRESUPPOSITIONAL NATURALISTIC MATERIALISTIC WORLD-VIEW I FULLY ADMIT LOOSELY SPEAKING IT IS NATURAL FOR US TO BELIEVE THAT ALL LIVING BEINGS IN FACT DO SHARE TO DIFFERENT EXTENTS MODES OF SENTIENCE AND I WOULD AGREE THAT THEY DO

WHAT

WHY WOULD I ASSUME ANY OTHER HUMAN BUT ME WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE SENTIENCE WHY WOULD I ASSUME THAT I'M NOT JUST THE ONLY ONE THAT EXISTS AS A BRAIN IN A VAT IS THIS BASICALLY HIS POINT
I LIKE SAM HARRIS AND I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM MORE WITHOUT ANY MISCONCEPTIONS I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT HIM WHEN I LISTENED TO AN ADC PODCAST WITH HIM AS A GUEST
REMOVED
REMOVED
THE ISSUE IS PRESCRIBING A SHOULD TO SOMETHING OPTIONAL LIKE ETHICS

THE SIMPLE PROOF FOR SECULAR ETHICS IS JUST THAT IF A RULE HOLDS UNIVERSALLY PREFERABLE TO ALL IT'S ETHICAL ALL OTHER BEHAVIORS EXIST OUTSIDE OF ETHICAL MORALITY

SO AN ETHICAL PREMISE DON'T KILL EACH OTHER CAN BE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND PREFERRED BY EVERYONE AT THE SAME TIME THE RULE MURDER EACH OTHER CAN ONLY BE PREFERABLE TO UP LESS THAN ALL AGENTS THEREFORE IS NOT UNIVERSALLY PREFERABLE THUS NOT MORAL BEHAVIOR
THIS ARTICLE IS INCREDIBLY LAZY SHE BEGINS RIGHT OFF THE BAT BY BROACHING THE PROBLEM WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SAM HAS ALREADY ADDRESSED AND CRITICIZED THE AUTHOR MAKES IT SEEM AS THOUGH EITHER SHE HADN'T BOTHERED TO ACTUALLY READ EVEN JUST THE FIRST COUPLE OF CHAPTERS OF HIS BOOK OR THAT SHE SHE COULD GET AWAY WITH OBFUSCATION THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY BORING AND DULL READ
REMOVED
GREAT LISTEN HERE'S WHAT I GOT OUT OF IT BASICALLY HE IS SAYING THAT WHATEVER WE ARE MADE OUT OF IS IRRELEVANT THE BODY SOUL QUESTION IS FRAMING THE MATTER INCORRECTLY WE COULD BE COMPLETELY PHYSICAL OR COMPLETELY AND STILL BE FUNCTIONALLY NEARLY IDENTICAL THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY EVIDENCE THAT ANY EXISTING SYSTEM HAS A FUNCTION THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REPRODUCE AS LONG AS THE TWO VERSIONS ARE FUNCTIONALLY IDENTICAL THE QUESTION OF MINUTE LIMITATIONS BASED UPON SUBSTANCE IS REALLY A VERY SMALL AND UNIMPORTANT ONE WE NEED TO DEVELOP GENERAL THEORIES ABOUT WHAT THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE MIND ARE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS A MECHANICAL MIND OR SPIRITUAL MIND BEFORE WORRYING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN THE PARTICULAR CONFIGURATIONS OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS A MORE GENERAL THEORY WILL BE MORE USEFUL AT A HIGHER LEVEL THE COMPLEXITY OF HUMAN ACTION SHOWS THAT WE DO HAVE AUTONOMY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT AUTONOMY IS PURELY PHYSICAL OR COMES FROM A SOUL SO THE RELEVANT ISSUE IS WHAT IDENTICAL FUNCTIONAL STATE COULD PRODUCE THE RESULTS WE SEE REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT IS MADE OUT OF


WHEN IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IT WE HAVE NO IDEA FROM WHENCE EXPERIENCE ARISES ONLY HOW CHANGES TO THE HUMAN BODY EFFECT IT THE REST IS ALL CONJECTURE AND SINCE ONLY SOME EXPERIENTIAL INFORMATION IS SHARABLE PERSONAL INTERNAL EXPLORATION IS IMPEDITIVE TO REALLY UNDERSTANDING REALITY I FIND EXPLANATIONS TO PROVIDE MORE PROBLEMS THAN SOLUTIONS WHERE INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDINGS OF PHENOMENA WITH ABSOLUTELY NO UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THEY HAPPEN CAN GO FAR
DELETED
SO BASICALLY ZEN BUDDHISM
THIS WAS VERY INTERESTING HILARY PUTNAM IS NEW TO ME CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND A BOOK BY HIM
U IS NOW CONDUCTING THE AMA HERE PLEASE WELCOME PROFESSOR SCHARP TO R PHILOSOPHY
HI KEVIN I TRIED TO READ YOUR BOOK REPLACING TRUTH A WHILE BACK BUT IT WAS A LITTLE HEAVY FOR ME AT THE TIME SO I WAS UNABLE TO FINISH NONETHELESS I FIND YOUR WORK VERY INTERESTING AND I HOPE TO RETURN TO THE BOOK SOMEDAY

ONE OF THE MOST VEXING PROBLEMS FOR ME HAS BEEN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER LOGIC CAN BE RATIONALLY REVISED CLEARLY YOUR PROJECT IS REVISIONIST SO I HAVE TO ASK HOW DO YOU APPROACH THIS QUESTION OF RATIONAL REVISION
HELLO PROFESSOR SCHARP THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO CONDUCT THIS AMA LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I GREATLY ADMIRE YOUR WORK AND DEDICATION TO THIS PROJECT AS I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN PURSUING ASCENDING AND DESCENDING TRUTH FOR QUITE SOME TIME

I HAVE GREAT DOUBTS ABOUT THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OF YOUR WORK IN PARTICULAR I FIND YOUR CLAIM THAT IT SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH CONSISTENT CONCEPTS THAT CAN DO TRUTH S JOB WITHOUT GIVING RISE TO PARADOXES DISCONCERTING I TRUST THAT YOU'VE DONE THE RELEVANT WORK TO SOLVE TRUTH RELATED PARADOXES THAT PRESENTLY EXIST DUE TO THE CANONICAL CONCEPT OF TRUE HOWEVER IN SOLVING THESE PARADOXES WITH YOUR ASCENDING TRUTH AND DESCENDING TRUTH MIGHT YOU HAVE CREATED A NEW PARADOX OR TWO WITHIN YOUR FRAMEWORK

WHILE I CANNOT POINT TO A GLARING FLAW IN YOUR CURRENT THEORY MY SUSPICION ARISES FROM AN INTUITION I HAVE GATHERED IN MY ACADEMIC PURSUITS AS I SEE IT EVERY THEORETICAL FIELD IS VULNERABLE TO AN IDIOSYNCRATIC INCONSISTENCY FROM THE MICROSCOPIC QUANTUM INDETERMINACY EXEMPLIFIED BY UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE TO THE MACROSCOPIC BREAKDOWN OF SPACETIME A LA GENERAL BLACK HOLES AND EVEN IN THE VERY FOUNDATIONAL CORE OF MATHEMATICAL LOGIC I'M SURE YOU ARE WELL VERSED IN INCOMPLETENESS THEOREMS THE UNIVERSE TENDS TO BUCK AT ANY SIGN OF ABSOLUTE MASTERY

WHAT MAKES YOU SO CERTAIN THAT YOUR THEORY IS IMMUNE FROM THIS FATAL REVENGE

I RECOGNIZE THAT A REDDIN AMA CAN ONLY PROVIDE SO MUCH SPACE FOR ANSWERING A QUESTION SUCH AS MINE AND THAT FURTHER THE SOLUTION MIGHT JUST RESIDE IN A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF YOUR WORK PERHAPS THE SOLUTION IS AS SIMPLE AS SURRENDERING TO INCONSISTENCY FROM THE AS YOU'VE DONE YET WE FIND IN THE EXAMPLE OF GIT THAT AXIOMATIZING THE GDEL SENTENCE ONLY CREATES A NEW SYSTEM WITH A NEW SET OF PROBLEMS SO PERHAPS NOT

IN ANY CASE ANY RESPONSE AND GUIDANCE THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE HERE WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED
HI PROFESSOR WHAT'S YOUR FAVOURITE PUB IN ST ANDREWS
HI PROFESSOR SCHARP SINCE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COHERENCE OF TRUTH CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT UNDEFINABILITY THEOREM ACTUALLY MEANS FOR THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE WORK YOU'RE DOING
HI PROFESSOR
WHAT A COOL BACKGROUND
I AM STARTING A PHD IN MATHEMATICS AND I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THE FOUNDATIONS OF PREMATCH ALGEBRA THAT I ALMOST THINK I WOULD RATHER STUDY THE PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS I WAS WONDERING IF YOU KNEW OF ANY MATHEMATICIANS COMMUNITIES OF MATHEMATICALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY TRYING TO LOOK A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE FOUNDATIONS OF SET GROUP THEORY AND THE LIKE OR ANY OTHER WAY I CAN STUDY PHILOSOPHY WHILE GETTING A PHD IN MATH LOL
THANKS
DELETED
HI PROFESSOR SCHARP

I AM IN NO POSITION TO BENEFIT FROM YOUR WORK AS OF BUT REGARDLESS I HAVE FOUND ENJOYMENT IN READING YOUR BOOK REPLACING PHILOSOPHY THIS BOOK HAS IT'S FOCUS ON METHODOLOGY AND SO I WOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DIDN'T RELATE THIS QUESTION TO A PROBLEM I AM HAVING DURING YOUR EARLY TWENTIES YOU WOULD OF BECAME INCREASINGLY ADEPT AT DIGESTING PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS CONCEPTS AND BOOKS

WHAT BOOKS PERSONALLY INSPIRED YOUR DESIRE TO BECOME AN AVID READER HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE TRANSFORMATION THAT IMPROVED YOUR READING ABILITY

THANKS AND ALL THE BEST

HI KEVIN

I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU I REALIZE THAT YOU MAY NOT GET TO BOTH OR EITHER OF THEM BUT I AM VERY INTERESTED IN YOUR ANSWERS

ON CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING I SEE THAT YOU DISTINGUISH CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING FROM OTHER METHODOLOGIES LIKE THE CANBERRA PLAN WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE CARNACIAN EXPLICATION ARE THERE ANY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING AND EXPLICATION IS ONE PERHAPS A SPECIES OF THE OTHER

2 IN ONE OF THE VIDEOS ABOVE YOU CITED TED ONTOLOGISE AS A CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING PROJECT IN ONTOLOGISE THE EXISTENTIAL QUANTIFIER IS REENGINEERED TO BE FUNDAMENTAL IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRESERVE THE SUBSTANTIVITY OF ONTOLOGICAL DISPUTES IT SEEMS LIKE YOU WERE HINTING AT A DISTINCTION BETWEEN CONCEPTUAL ENGINEERING PROJECTS THERE ARE THOSE WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY IMPROVING OUR CONCEPTS IN SOME SENSE AND THERE ARE THOSE WHERE WE ARE SIMPLY DEFINING OURSELVES OUT OF SOME PROBLEM DO YOU THINK BOTH TYPES OF PROJECTS ARE WORTHWHILE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ONTOLOGISE

BY THE WAY REALLY ENJOYED YOUR DEBATE AGAINST WILLIAM LANE CRAIG

FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOUR DEBATE WITH WILLIAM CRAIG DEMOLISHED ANY RESERVATIONS I HAD ABOUT ABANDONING CHRISTIANITY ON FEAR OF BEING WRONG AND GOING TO HELL FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY NEWLY COLD BLACK ATHEIST HEART THANK YOU DO YOU THINK RELIGION IS HARMFUL AND IF SO WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO SPREAD THE ATHEISTIC WORLD-VIEW

CAN AN ATHEIST HAVE JUSTIFIED BELIEF FOR THE OBJECTIVITY OF MORAL VALUES AND DUTIES ARE WE LOOSING ANYTHING WITH SUBJECTIVE MORALITY

WHEN I TELL PEOPLE ABOUT MY ATHEISM THE MOST COMMON QUESTION I GET IS HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THE MEANINGLESSNESS OF LIFE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO QUESTIONS LIKE THESE WHERE RELIGIOUS PEOPLE EQUATE NOT BELIEVING IN THEIR GOD TO A MEANINGLESS EXISTENCE
HOWDY DR SCHARP

YOU'VE STATED IN YOUR DEBATE WITH WILLIAM LANE CRAIG THAT CENTURY ATHEISM IS COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF REDUCTIVE NATURALISM BUT CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME HOW AN ATHEISTIC WORLD-VIEW DOES NOT REDUCE TO OR PERHAPS ENTAIL NATURALISM

THANK YOU FOR TAKING OUT TIME TO DO THIS AMA AND ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS I ENJOYED YOUR ATTITUDE AND PREPAREDNESS IN YOUR DEBATE WITH ONE OF FINEST APOLOGISTS TAKE CARE
THIS IS A RECENT DEBATE BETWEEN WILLIAM LANE CRAIG AND KEVIN SCHARP PROFESSOR SCHARP WILL ALSO BE DOING AN AMA HERE ON R PHILOSOPHY WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER AT EST PLEASE SEE THIS POST WHERE YOU CAN SUBMIT QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME OR JOIN US WEDNESDAY AT IN WELCOMING PROF SCHARP TO OUR COMMUNITY

PROFESSOR SLIDES AND SCRIPT CAN BE FOUND HERE HETP
AROUND WE HAVE THIS EXCHANGE

CRAIG THE OF THE UNIVERSE IS MORE PROBABLE GIVEN THEISM THAN IT IS GIVEN NATURALISM AND THERE IT SEEMS TO ME ALL THE THEIST NEEDS TO SHOW IS THAT IT'S NOT IMPROBABLE THAT GOD WOULD WANT TO CREATE A FINELY TUNED UNIVERSE AND THAT IS SURELY GOING TO BE MUCH MUCH MORE PROBABLE THAN IN NATURALISM ALL OF THESE CONSTANTS AND QUANTITIES FALLING BY ACCIDENT INTO THE ZONE

SCHARP GOOD I'M NOT GOING TO GET SUCKED INTO THAT TRYING TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT GOD WOULD DO OR WHAT HE WOULDN'T DO OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S ALL DIVINE PSYCHOLOGY IT'S EQUALLY MURKY AND UNCLEAR AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE ANY OF THAT STUFF SO IF YOU WANT TO PUSH THE ARGUMENT THEN WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS SAY THAT THE CHANCES THAT GOD WOULD CREATE THE UNIVERSE ARE ACTUALLY BETTER THAN THE CHANCES THAT IT WAS CREATED RANDOMLY GIVEN THIS AND YOU DON'T DO THAT

I DON'T UNDERSTAND POINT HERE WHY IS THE THEIST RESPONSIBLE FOR DEMONSTRATING THAT IT'S NOT UNLIKELY THAT GOD IF HE EXISTED WOULD CREATE CONDITIONS THE DIVINE PSYCHOLOGY OBJECTION MIGHT SUGGEST THAT WE CAN'T HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT GOD WOULD DO IF HE EXISTED BUT EVEN THEN DOESN'T THE PROBABILITY THAT GOD IF HE EXISTED WOULD CREATE CONDITIONS REST AT A COMFORTABLE AND THIS IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE PROBABILITY OF NATURALISTIC CONDITIONS LEADING TO CONDITIONS WHICH IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE ARGUMENT THROUGH
I DON'T LIKE WAC I FEEL THAT ALL THE THIS IS CONFUSING ME AND USING TO DISTORT THE DEBATE HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE HONEST ABOUT HAVING A CLEAR DEBATE HE HAS ARGUED ABOUT THE EVIDENCE OF GOD MANY TIMES BUT STILL CONFUSES SOM OF THE OPPONENTS BASIC ARGUMENTS HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT HE MEAN AFTER HEARING IT FOR TIME
CRAIG IF YOU THINK IT'S MORE PROBABLY TRUE THAN FALSE I WOULD SAY THAT IS ENOUGH FOR BELIEF

SCHARP NOT ACCORDING TO CONTEMPORARY EPISTEMOLOGY

I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS APPEAL TO CONSENSUS CONSENSUS HOLDS VERY LITTLE WEIGHT IN PHILOSOPHY SCHARP GOES ON TO SAY THAT YOU NEED AT LEAST OR PERCENT CONFIDENCE IN A PROPOSITION IN ORDER TO HAVE A BELIEF WHERE IS HE GETTING THIS FROM WHAT ARGUMENT DOES HE PRESENT IS IT AN APPEAL TO INTUITION WELL THAT'S NO BETTER THAN WHAT CRAIG IS OFFERING WHEN HE SAYS CONSTITUTES BELIEF

CRAIG IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT THERE IS ANY LEVEL THAT YOU COULD SET TO SAY THIS IS WHAT'S REQUIRED TO BE A THEIST

SCHARP I'M NOT SAYING IT'S REQUIRED TO BE A THEIST I'M SAYING IT'S REQUIRED FOR BELIEF

BUT THEISM JUST IS THE BELIEF IN THE PROPOSITION GOD EXISTS

SCHARP QUESTIONS THE CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE OF HELL IMPLYING IT'S AN IMMORAL DOCTRINE WHERE GOD SORT OF BLACKMAILS PEOPLE INTO ACCEPTING HIM CS LEWIS WROTE ON THIS TOPIC AND I THINK HE GAVE A GOOD RESPONSE TO IT GOD IS BASICALLY THE ULTIMATE GOOD AND GOD IS THE THING THAT GIVES ANYTHING ELSE IT'S GOODNESS SO WHEN HUMANS FREELY CHOOSE TO REMAIN SEPARATED FROM GOD THEY WILLINGLY DEPRIVE THEMSELVES OF THE ULTIMATE GOOD IT'S AS IF A THIRSTY MAN IS WALKING IN A DESERT AND GOD OFFERS WATER BUT THE MAN REJECTS IT IT'S NOT THAT GOD IS CAUSING THE SUFFERING AND DEATH OF THE MANUAL GOD IS TRYING TO HELP THE MAN BUT THE MAN REJECTS THE THING THAT COULD GIVE HIM HEALTH AND HAPPINESS AS LEWIS SAID THE GATES OF HELL ARE LOCKED ON THE INSIDE THOSE WHO REJECT GOD DO SO WILLINGLY AND GOD RESPECTS THAT FREE CHOICE HE DOES NOT IMPOSE HIMSELF ON THEM BUT THE NATURE OF REALITY IS SUCH THAT A STATE OF SEPARATION FROM GOD IS ONE OF SUFFERING IT IS NOT THE SUFFERING OF ONE MAN TORTURING ANOTHER MAN BUT RATHER THE SUFFERING OF THE PARCHED MAN WHO FREELY REJECTS THE OFFER OF WATER

BY THE WAY THIS FORMAT OF DEBATE WAS NOT GOOD CRAIG AND SCHARP BARELY HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO EACH OTHER THE BEST PART WAS THE MINUTE BACK AND FORTH SESSION ALL OF THESE GOD DEBATES SHOULD HAVE THE MAJORITY OF TIME SPENT IN THIS BACK AND FORTH FORMAT BUT THE MODERATOR WASTED A LOT OF THAT TIME

THERE WAS SO MUCH SCHARP SAID THAT I TAKE ISSUE WITH AT THE END FOR EXAMPLE HE ADVISED THE AUDIENCE TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND CRAFT THEIR OWN BELIEFS INSTEAD OF ADOPTING OLD BELIEFS AND HE IMPLIED THAT CHRISTIAN BELIEFS ARE NO GOOD BECAUSE THEY'RE FROM THE IRON AGE BUT THIS IS JUST CHRONOLOGICAL SNOBBERY TO QUOTE LEWIS AGAIN JUST BECAUSE AN IDEA IS OLD DOESN'T MEAN IT'S FALSE

SCHARP IS ASKED FOR AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE NONEXISTENCE OF GOD AND HE GIVES WHAT HE CALLS A CONFIDENCE ARGUMENT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN SCIENTIFIC THEORIES THAN IN THE EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED FOR GOD BUT THIS CONFIDENCE ARGUMENT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT THAT LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION GOD DOES NOT EXIST IT'S JUST AN ARGUMENT THAT AT BEST LEADS TO AGNOSTICISM
IF REALITY IS TRANSCENDENT THEN WHY DO WE INSIST IT MUST CONFORM TO OUR LOGIC AND REASON IF REALITY TRANSCENDS OUR REASON THEN HOW CAN WE CONCLUDE THE UNIVERSE MUST BE METAPHYSICALLY SUCH AND SUCH
I REALLY LOVE WAC HONESTLY I KNOW IT'S NOT A POPULAR VIEW BUT I'D PUT HIM EASILY IN MY TOP FAVORITE LIVING PHILOSOPHERS
ATTENTION MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION IN THE COMMENTS VIOLATES COMMENTING RULE 2

READ THE POSTED CONTENT UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS GIVEN AND RESPOND TO THESE SUBSTANTIVELY IF YOU HAVE UNRELATED THOUGHTS OR DON'T WISH TO READ THE CONTENT PLEASE POST YOUR OWN THREAD OR SIMPLY REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING COMMENTS WHICH ARE CLEARLY NOT IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE POSTED CONTENT MAY BE REMOVED

WHILE I PERSONALLY AM WILLING TO LET SOME COMMENTS THAT STRAY FROM THE SUBJECT OF THE ARTICLE SLIDE IF THEY ARE PART OF AN INSIGHTFUL DIALOGUE THIS IS NOT ONE OF THESE TIMES

A BRIEF ASIDE TO THE MAJORITY OF COMMENTERS WHOSE COMMENTS I WILL NOW REMOVE YOUR ALMOST UNIFORMLY UNINFORMED PROUDLY IGNORANT LAZY NONSENSICAL AND ABOVE ALL TOXIC COMMENTS ARE FULL OF HATE AND DISPARAGING TOWARDS SUBJECTS YOU CLEARLY KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT AND ARE EMPHATICALLY NOT WELCOME HERE AND WILL BE SUMMARILY REMOVED
AS A SCIENTIST WHENEVER I SEE PEOPLE SPEAK OF CONSCIOUSNESS THEIR ARGUMENT HINGES ON THE FACT THAT YOU MUST HAVE A FOGGY DEFINITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS

HOWEVER IN NEUROLOGICAL TERMS CONSCIOUSNESS SIMPLY REFERS TO BEING AWAKE REFLECTIVE AWARENESS IS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BUT WE CAN DIFFERENTIATE FROM OTHER PROCESSES AND EVEN SHOW THAT SOME GREAT APES ARE CAPABLE OF THIS WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT SO THERE MUST BE A BIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR IT WHICH DIFFERS AMONG ANIMALS WITH DIFFERENT BRAIN STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT THERE IS ALSO THEORY OF MIND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT OTHERS HAVE A MIND LIKE YOUR OWN AND THAT THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH THEIR OWN THOUGHTS SCIENCE CAN ALSO DIFFERENTIATE IN HUMANS AGES AT WHICH THEORY OF MIND DEVELOPS SO THIS MUST ALSO BE BIOLOGICALLY BASED AND IN HUMANS MUST BE DEVELOPED AFTER BIRTH

THE BEST WAY I CAN SUMMARIZE THE ARGUMENT IS LIKE SO IMAGINING A PERSON WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS YOU WOULD SAY IT IS NOT A PERSON HOWEVER GIVEN A BETTER DEFINITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE ARGUMENT BECOMES CLEARER AND MORE ACCURATE THE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO CONSIDER THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS NOT ONE THING BUT RATHER A COLLECTION OF DIFFERENT BRAIN PROCESSES ALL SERVING DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THAT WHEN COMBINED MAKE A FULLY FUNCTIONING PERSON

PICTURE A CAR I COME UP AND REMOVE THE MIRRORS IS IT STILL A CAR NEXT I REMOVE THE PAINT IS IT STILL A CAR I WOULD THINK SO BUT LET'S CONTINUE NEXT I'LL TAKE OFF THE WHEELS THEN THE HOOD IS IT STILL A CAR EACH OF THESE SERVE A FUNCTION AND EVENTUALLY IF YOU TAKE ENOUGH OF THEM AWAY IT WILL NO LONGER BE RECOGNIZABLE AS A CAR

THE SAME IS TRUE OF PEOPLE IF YOU SLOWLY DEACTIVATE DIFFERENT BRAIN CIRCUITS WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DIFFERENT THINGS YOU WILL STILL IDENTIFY THE THING AS A PERSON HOWEVER AT A CERTAIN POINT ONCE ENOUGH HAVE BEEN REMOVED YOU WILL IDENTIFY THAT THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE IS GONE WHY BECAUSE ENOUGH FUNCTIONS ARE GONE THAT THE SYSTEM NO LONGER EXISTS AS A FULLY FUNCTIONING PERSON THERE WAS NEVER A SINGLE GHOST IN THE MACHINE BUT RATHER SEVERAL GHOSTS WHICH WERE NEUROLOGICAL CIRCUITS UNDERLYING DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN FACT NOT GHOSTS THAT TOGETHER MADE UP THE WHOLE

SO LET'S SAY THERE IS A PERSON WHO LOSES THE USE OF THEIR VISUAL CORTEX DAMN I CAN'T SEE WE WOULD PROBABLY ALL AGREE BLIND PEOPLE ARE STILL PEOPLE YET ARE THEY COMPLETE IN THE SENSE THAT A NORMAL PERSON IS NOW LET'S REMOVE THEIR ABILITY TO HEAR AND DO MATH AS WELL AS THEIR ABILITY TO INHIBIT OTHER BRAIN ACTIVITIES I EAST THIS PERSON NOW HAS FRONTOTEMPORAL DAMAGE NOW HERE'S A GOOD ONE LET'S DAMAGE THE JUNCTION THIS PERSON CAN NO LONGER DREAM IS SOMEONE WHO CANNOT DREAM STILL A PERSON NEXT LET'S DO AWAY WITH THE THE REFLECTIVE AWARENESS AT SOME POINT THIS WILL CEASE TO BE IDENTIFIABLE AS A PERSON

MY POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU ASK PHILOSOPHERS TO CLEARLY DEFINE CONSCIOUSNESS RATHER THAN REFERRING TO IT IN VAGUE TERMS THE ARGUMENT THAT PHILOSOPHY IS NEEDED FOR SCIENCE FALLS APART BECAUSE SCIENCE CAN RATIONALIZE AND EXPLAIN SOMETHING WHEN IT IS CLEARLY DEFINED THAT IS ITS PURPOSE SO PHILOSOPHY IS NOT NECESSARY I AM NOT SAYING IT'S NOT WORTHWHILE OF COURSE IT IS IT'S A PART OF OUR HISTORY AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTH STUDYING IN THAT CONTEXT HOWEVER IT'S NOT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN CONSCIOUSNESS BECAUSE THOSE QUESTIONS CAN BE ADDRESSED BY SCIENCE WHEN YOUR DEFINITIONS ARE CLEAR
DELETED
THIS IS THE WRONG ASSUMPTION THE WHOLE ARTICLE BASED UPON

BOTH OF THEM WILL ALWAYS CLAIM THAT EVIDENCE SUPPORT THEIR VISION THEN WE NEED TO USE PHILOSOPHICAL TOOLS TO SOLVE THE CONFLICT RATHER THAN SCIENTIFIC ONES

PRETTY MUCH NO CONFLICT HAS EVER BEEN SOLVED IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY LIKE THAT MOST THEORETICAL CONFLICTS AND THERE ARE MANY OF THEM IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY IS SOLVED IN THE SAME FASHION IN OTHER SCIENCES DOING FURTHER EMPIRICAL RESEARCH

THE FACT THAT THIS ARTICLE IS ONLY FOCUSED ON AN EXPERIMENTAL PARADIGM CREATED IN SHOWS HOW LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE IS PRESENTED IN THE ARTICLE YOU DON'T INTERPRET THE SAME DATA FROM ONE SIMPLE PARADIGM WHEN CONFLICTS ARISE YOU DIFFERENTIATE THEORIES EXPLANATIONS FROM EACH OTHER AND DESIGN PARADIGMS THAT CAN FALSIFY THE OTHER ONE YOU CAN ALSO GET HELP FROM OTHER DISCIPLINES LIKE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY

THIS IS NOT TO SAY PHILOSOPHY HAS NO PLACE IN THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD YOU DERIVE HYPOTHESES AND THEORIES BASED ON PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION BUT TRYING TO INTERPRET A SINGLE SET OF DATA FROM AN EXPERIMENT THAT CAN NOT FALSIFY ANY THEORETICAL POINT IS JUST USELESS AND HAS NO PLACE OR VALUE IN TERMS OF DISCOVERING NEW INFORMATION
IN SCIENCE WHEN YOU HAVE TWO COMPETING THEORIES HOW DO YOU KNOW WHICH IS CORRECT YOU HAVE EACH OF THEM MAKE PREDICTIONS YES SOME WILL BE THE SAME BUT SOME WILL BE DIVERGENT TEST THE DIVERGENT CASES AND YOUR DONE

THIS ARTICLE JUST BLINDLY TOSSES OUT THE STATEMENT THAT NO AMOUNT OF EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE CAN DISTINGUISH THESE TWO THEORIES I CALL BS EITHER THE TWO THEORIES ARE IN FACT THE SAME OR THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IT MUST BE AN EMPIRICAL DIFFERENCE NOBEL PRIZES AND THE LIKE ARE OFTEN GIVEN OUT BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO DRAW UP AN EXPERIMENT WHICH EMPHASIZED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TWO COMPETING THEORIES CREATING WELL CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS WHICH CAN HELP SELECT BETWEEN THEORIES IS WHAT SCIENTISTS SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME DOING

I THINK YOU RE CONFUSING THE CODE WITH THE EXECUTABLE

THE CODE THAT IS WRITTEN IN SOME PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE PARSED AND COMPILED INTO EXECUTABLE SOFTWARE IS NOT THE ANALOG OF HUMAN THOUGHT IT S THE ANALOG OF HUMAN DNA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES ARE STRUCTURED TO ENFORCE CONSISTENCY BUT THIS DOES NOT CONSTRAIN THE BEHAVIOR OF THE EXECUTABLE ANY MORE THAN THE PROCESSES GOVERNING PROTEIN SYNTHESIS FROM NUCLEIC ACIDS CONSTRAIN YOUR ABILITY TO THINK

IN AI LEARNED PATTERNS ARE TYPICALLY NOT REPRESENTED AS STATEMENTS IN SOME INTERNAL LANGUAGE BUT AS STRUCTURES LIKE WEIGHTED GRAPHS OR VECTORS AND MATRICES THERE S NO THEORETICAL REASON WHY SUCH STRUCTURES COULD NOT LEARN TO ELICIT DESIRED BEHAVIOR FROM PEOPLE BY COMMUNICATING TO THEM A MODEL OF REALITY THAT DIFFERS FROM WHAT IT PERCEIVES AS TRUE
THIS ARGUMENT BEGINS AND ENDS WITH THE FACT THAT THE HUMAN MIND IS FINITE AND EXISTS SOLELY IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD IT IS BUILDABLE REPRODUCIBLE AND CAN THEORETICALLY BE COPIED JUST LIKE ANY OTHER ASPECT OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD
YOU ARE THINKING OF PROGRAMMING A COMPUTER MUCH TO LINEARLY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS DEBATE EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST SAID ADDING TWO NUMBERS CAN BE TRAINED INTO A VERY BASIC NEURAL NETWORK WITH ACCURACY

IF IT CAN CALCULATE A THEOREM AND ITS NEGATION THEN IT DOESN T KNOW WHICH IS TRUE AND WHICH IS FALSE

HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT 2 2 YOU WERE THOUGHT THAT IN A VERY SIMILAR MANNER YOU CAN TEACH A PROGRAM THAT 2 2 THAT IV V IX ETC
AND YOU CAN TEACH IT THE CONCEPT OF RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER AND IF YOU CHOSE TO YOU CAN ASK IT TO PROVIDE THE WRONG ANSWER AND BASED ON THE PREVIOUSLY LEARNED MODEL IT WILL KNOW WHICH ONE IS WHICH
I SCANNED YOUR POST AND RAN INTO TWO PROBLEMS OR WARNING LIGHTS IF YOU WILL

A WHEN YOU WRITE THAT A HUMAN MIND CAN LIE IN A WAY THAT A COMPUTER CANNOT THEN IT IMMEDIATELY MAKES ME SUSPECT THAT YOU MAY HAVE A PROBLEM OF APPRECIATING THE COMPLEXITY OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IT IS AS IF YOUR LOGICAL ACCOUNT OF A COMPUTER LYING CORRESPONDS TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF A BUILDING WHILE THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO LIE CORRESPONDS TO THE FLOOR OF ABSTRACTIONS UP IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR THAT A COMPUTER DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO LIE IN THAT HUMAN SENSE

B WHO SAYS THE MIND IS CONSISTENT I REMEMBER READING SOMEWHERE AN EXPERT OPINION THAT FOR COMPUTERS TO ACHIEVE HUMAN LEVEL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE THEY MUST BE ALLOWED TO MAKE MISTAKES BE WRONG FALLIBLE INCONSISTENT ETC

AND AS A NOTE THE DEBATABLE SOMETHING THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE AND COMPUTERS MAY NEVER HAVE IS A THING THAT TRANSCENDS WORDS AND LOGIC AND THEREFORE ANY ATTEMPT TO PROVE IT SEEMS FUTILE ARE YOU NOT MISSING THE WHOLE POINT THEN


THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT A COMPUTER WOULD SAY
A SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL COMPUTER CAN RUN A PHYSICS SIMULATION OF AN ACTUAL HUMAN BRAIN THIS REFUTES YOUR ARGUMENT

I THINK YOUR ARGUMENT MUST BE PUTTING LIMITATIONS ON WHAT A COMPUTER CAN DO WHICH DO NOT REALLY EXIST
ITT RAMPANT IGNORANCE IN FIELDS OF NEUROSCIENCE AND IT TAKE PRECAUTIONS
THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR ARGUMENT IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT A COMPUTER DOESN'T KNOW OR UNDERSTAND WHILE WE DO THEY'VE DONE EXPERIMENTS WHICH SHOW ELECTRIC SIGNALS SENT TO THE BRAIN CAN CAUSE A LIMB TO MOVE WHY CAN'T BRAIN SURGERY ADVANCE TO THE POINT THEY CAN UPLOAD YEARS OF EDUCATION DOES AN UNCONSCIOUS OR DEAD PERSON HAVE KNOWLEDGE WHY CAN'T WE ARGUE A COMPUTER ISN'T FUNCTIONING PROPERLY UNTIL IT PASSES THE TURING TEST UNDER THE SAME PRETEXT AN UNCONSCIOUS HUMAN CAN'T LIE DO COMPUTERS FEEL PAIN NO WHAT ABOUT A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING COMPUTER WE CAN PROGRAM IT TO ACT LIKE IT DOES DO HUMANS FEEL PAIN THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH CONGENITAL ANALGESIA WHICH CAN'T SO A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING HUMAN DOES MAYBE A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING COMPUTER DOES TOO LOSING A LIMB CAN SUCK BUT CAN'T A ROBOT ALSO LOSE A LIMB AND FEEL THE PAIN OF TRYING TO FUNCTION NORMALLY AH BUT A ROBOT YOU CAN JUST REPAIR THE LOST LIMB YET WITH HUMANS STEM CELL RESEARCH IS NEARLY AT THE STAGE WE CAN REPLACE LIMBS NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT WE'RE JUST A PROGRAM A PERSON CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AND THUS REPROGRAMMED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IMAGINE SOMEONE WITH AMNESIA SO SEVERE THEY FORGOT HOW TO SPEAK HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THEIR VISION AND EVEN HOW TO BREATHE THEY GET HOOKED UP TO SOME MACHINE TO HELP THEM BREATHE UNTIL THEIR BRAIN HEALS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO REMEMBER HOW TO BREATHE THEN THEY RELEARN HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF DIMENSIONAL SHAPES ETC

SO WHY CAN'T A COMPUTER ROBOT JUST BE PROGRAMMED TO HAVE REASONS TO LIE IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHICH IT KNOWS IS FALSE
YOU ARE USING TWO DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS FOR THE WORD KNOW ONE FOR COMPUTERS AND ONE FOR HUMANS THIS DIFFERENCE IN DEFINITION DOES NEARLY ALL OF THE LEGWORK IN YOUR ARGUMENT THE ESSENTIAL DIFFICULTY IN MAKING THE ARGUMENT YOU WANT TO MAKE IS THAT YOU MUST CLARIFY HOW HUMANS PHYSICALLY KNOW THINGS IN TERMS OF BRAIN CHEMISTRY BEFORE YOU CAN PROVE THAT COMPUTERS CANNOT DO THAT
PREMISE A COMPUTER CAN KNOW THEOREM I IS EXPRESSED BY OUTPUT P IF AND ONLY IF THE COMPUTER EXECUTES OUTPUT P ONLY WHEN I IS DERIVED IN THE COMPUTER S PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE L BY THE COMPUTER

IN OTHER WORDS A COMPUTER THAT KNOWS THAT I IS EXPRESSED AS P IS NOT ALLOWED TO OUTPUT P WHEN IT FOR EXAMPLE KNOWS I IS FALSE THIS COULD BE EXPRESSED AS COMPUTERS CANNOT KNOWINGLY STATE A FALSEHOOD

WHICH IS OF COURSE FALSE

IT IS EASY TO MAKE A COMPUTER LIE I CAN GET A COMPUTER TO LIE BY RETURNING INCORRECT INFORMATION

THE COMPUTER MUST KNOWINGLY COMMUNICATE AN IDEA VIA A MESSAGE OR OUTPUT OF SOME KIND AND IT MUST KNOW THIS IDEA IS FALSE PROVIDING AN OUTPUT OR SOME SYNTACTIC STRING OF CHARACTERS THAT YOU PERCEIVE AS INCORRECT OR DO NOT WANT DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A LIE THE OUTPUT COMMUNICATING A FALSE IDEA ACCORDING TO SOME SEMANTIC MODEL UNAWARE TO THE COMPUTER ALSO DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A LIE

IT IS ALSO EASY TO MAKE A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT HAS AN INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION SUCH AS A THEOREM PROVER THEN TACK ON A PROGRAM AT THE END THAT NEGATES THE OUTPUT

A PERSON CAN EXECUTE AN OUTPUT SUCH AS WRITING A STATEMENT THAT HE KNOWS EXPRESSES AN IDEA THAT HE KNOWS IS FALSE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW A BASIC THEOREM LIKE 2 2 IS TRUE AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE CAPABLE OF LYING ABOUT IT LYING PER THIS DEFINITION IS AN INCREDIBLY EASY THING FOR A HUMAN TO DO

YES AND INDEED A COMPUTER CAN DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING TAKE THE THEOREM PROVER OR SOMETHING AND OUTPUT THE NEGATION OF ALL THE THEOREMS IT KNOWS YOU COULD EVEN GO ONE STEP FURTHER AND TACK ON PLANNING SOFTWARE SO THAT IT MADE PLANS INVOLVING THOSE LIES WITHIN SOME KIND OF ENVIRONMENT WHERE CERTAIN GULLIBLE INDIVIDUALS WOULD REWARD IT FOR LYING FOR EXAMPLE WITH REDDIN KARMA GIVEN THE POPULARITY OF THIS POST IT SEEMS MY LATEST AI PROJECT IS DOING VERY WELL
FIRST THANKS FOR THE THOUGHT-OUT AND INTERESTING POST MY OBJECTION

TAKING UP YOUR EXAMPLE OF ADDITION LET'S SAY WE ADD AN ADDITIONAL BOOLEAN VARIABLE V TRUE FALSE WHOSE VALUE DECIDES WHETHER THE COMPUTER SPITS OUT A CORRECT 2 2 OR INCORRECT 2 2 RESPONSE THINK OF IT THIS WAY IF V FALSE THE COMPUTER IS INSTRUCTED TO CALCULATE TO DISPLAY A RESULT DIFFERENT BY TO WHATEVER THE RESULT OF THE ADDITION IS LET US FURTHER IMAGINE THAT SAID VARIABLE IS HIDDEN I EAST THAT THE END USER HAS NO ACCESS TO ITS VALUE AT ANY GIVEN POINT IN TIME AND FURTHER THAT ITS VALUE IS SET BY A FUNCTION OR SET OF FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL ADDITION OPERATION AND THAT THIS SET OF FUNCTIONS IS ALSO NOW THE COMPUTER WILL OUTPUT EITHER THE CORRECT OR INCORRECT ANSWER DEPENDING SAY ON THE TIME OF DAY AND YOUR LOCATION THE ANSWER WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TOTAL STATE OF THE SYSTEM INPUT ADDITION ALGORITHM VALUE OF V BUT NOT WITH THE ARITHMETICAL SENTENCE IN QUESTION THUS THE COMPUTER KNOWS ON YOUR DEFINITION THOUGH I PERSONALLY FIND YOUR USE OF THE TERM HERE PROBLEMATIC THAT OUTPUTTING IN RESPONSE TO 2 2 IS WRONG I EAST WITH THE FALSITY BEING REPRESENTED BY THE VALUE OF V YET THIS IS THE OUTPUT THAT IT AGAIN CONSISTENTLY GIVE IN SHORT I THINK THAT IN OVER SIMPLIFYING THE COMPUTER IN YOUR ARGUMENT YOU ALREADY ASSUME A SOLUTION TO THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM I EAST WHETHER SEMANTICS IS SOMEHOW EQUIVALENT TO A LARGE COMPLEX ENOUGH SYNTAX
CHEERS

EDIT WORDING

IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENT CORRECTLY YOU WORK WITH THE PREMISE THAT A HUMAN CAN LIE AND THEN YOU ARE GIVING ARGUMENTS WHY A COMPUTER CAN'T

IF THAT'S TRUE COULD YOU TRY TO MAKE THE REVERSE POINT BY THAT I MEAN START FROM THE PREMISE THAT A COMPUTER CAN'T LIE AND THEN PROOF WHY A HUMAN CAN

IN MY OPINION THERE IS KIND OF A SYMMETRY GOING ON BETWEEN THE TWO POSITIONS I THINK STARTING FORM THAT DIRECTION IT'S NOT REALLY POSSIBLE TO ARGUE THAT HUMANS CAN LIE WHEN COMPUTERS CAN

IN MY OPINION THE FLAW IN YOUR WHOLE ARGUMENT IS THAT YOU WORK WITH A HAZY DEFINITION FOR THE WORD KNOWING IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR ARGUMENT COULD BE REDUCED TO

HUMANS ARE ABLE TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT A SUBJECT AND THEREFORE ARE ABLE TO GIVE WRONG STATEMENTS ABOUT IT

COMPUTERS ARE NOT ABLE TO KNOW A SUBJECT AND ARE THEREFORE INCAPABLE OF ANYTHING BEYOND RESPONDING STATEMENTS ABOUT IT

EDIT
LETS SAY I MAKE THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM
THE BASIC OPERATION IS THAT IT RESPONDS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT SAY GEOGRAPHY
IT HAS THE CAPABILITY TO EVALUATE A HUMAN BASED ON CRITERIA TONE VOLUME SPEED OF VOICE AND SO ON AND CAN ASSIGN A VALUE TO EACH ONE THE PROGRAM KNOW CALCULATES BASED ON THAT WHETHER OR NOT IT LIKES A HUMAN IF IT LIKES A HUMAN IT GIVES CORRECT REPLIES IF IT DISLIKES A HUMAN IT WILL TELL YOU THAT FRANCE SHARES A BORDER WITH AUSTRALIA

HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM LYING
THEOREM A COMPUTER CANNOT LIE TH TH

THE LOEBNER PRIZE IS FOR MAKING A PROGRAM THAT CAN CONVINCE A PERSON THAT IT'S HUMAN BY COMMUNICATING ONLY THROUGH TYPING BY MOST DEFINITIONS THAT IS LYING THEREFORE THIS THEOREM IS DEMONSTRABLY IS WRONG

THE COMPUTER MUST KNOWINGLY COMMUNICATE AN IDEA VIA A MESSAGE OR OUTPUT OF SOME KIND AND IT MUST KNOW THIS IDEA IS FALSE

PREMISE HUMANS CAN PRESENT MESSAGES OR OUTPUTS THAT THEY KNOWINGLY EXPRESS A THEOREM THAT IS FALSE I KNOW WHAT THE STATEMENT 2 2 MEANS I KNOW THAT IT IS FALSE BUT I CAN WRITE IT ANYWAY

THERE ARE COMPUTER SYSTEMS TO SOLVE SYMBOLIC MATH EQUATIONS AND SHOW THE STEPS ALONG THE WAY YEARS AGO I TOOK ONE OF THESE AN MADE A TEST FOR PEOPLE TO FIND THE ERROR IN A PROOF I TOOK A VALID SOLUTION AND INTRODUCED AN ERROR EAST G ALLOWING THE SOLVER TO DIVIDE BY ZERO OR MAKE A NUMBER OF OTHER COMMON MISTAKES AND THEN COMPLETE THE PROOF THE PROGRAM KNEW THAT IT HAD ALLOWED A SET FORM THE FAULTY LOGIC OPERATIONS BUT PRESENTED THE PROOF NONE THE LESS YES IT THEN ADMITTED IT WAS WRONG AND SHOWED THE ERROR BUT WITHOUT THAT PART IT WOULD BE JUST AS VALID A LIE AS AS YOUR HUMAN EXAMPLE

IF YOU TAKE AN EVEN NARROWER DEFINITION OF LYING BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT KNOWING MEANS FOR A COMPUTER THEN YOU COULD SAY A COMPUTER EXECUTING A PROVEN CORRECT THEOREM CANNOT CALCULATE AN INCORRECT RESULT YOU STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM THAT IT MIGHT THEN TELL YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR OTHER REASONS EAST G NEGOTIATING A PRICE TRYING TO BREAK INTO AN ACCOUNT ETC EVEN WITHOUT THAT WE CAN STILL GET INTO BIT ERRORS DUE TO RADIATION CPU BUGS FLOATING POINT ROUNDING ERRORS OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT CAN MESS WITH THE CALCULATIONS BUT THIS ISN'T REALLY LYING JUST MAKING A MISTAKE

PREMISE 2 IF A COMPUTER KNOWS THEOREM I IS FALSE THEN IT CAN DERIVE I AND CANNOT DERIVE I

EVEN IF I KNOW SOMETHING TO BE FALSE EAST G IS WRONG BUT I CAN STILL CALCULATE THE OUTPUT IN SOME CASES COMPUTER PROGRAMS WILL USE ONE ALGORITHM THAT IT KNOWS TO BE WRONG TO SPEED UP CALCULATIONS ONLY OCCASIONALLY COMPARING IT WITH THE REAL ALGORITHM TO TRACK HOW BIG AN ERROR IT'S CALCULATING ALSO THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO BE FALSE SO THERE ISN'T ALWAYS A SINGLE INVERSE OF I

PREMISE IF A COMPUTER RUNNING A CONSISTENT PROGRAM DERIVES A THEOREM IT CANNOT DERIVE THE NEGATION OF THIS THEOREM

WHY NOT FROM FOR ALL X X IS IT'S EASY TO COME UP WITH THERE EXISTS X THERE'S NO REASON A COMPUTER CAN'T DO THE SAME THING

IF I UNDERSTAND PREMISE THEN IT IS FLAWED YOU HAVE DEFINED A COMPUTER'S KNOWLEDGE AS THAT WHICH IS COMMUNICATED NOT ONLY IS THIS FALSE BUT IT MAKES LYING IMPOSSIBLE BY DEFINITION

A SIMPLE CHESS COMPUTER MAY KNOW THOUSANDS OF BAD MOVES BUT NOT COMMUNICATE ALL OF THEM SO COMPUTERS CAN KNOW FACTS OR THEOREMS WITHOUT COMMUNICATING THEM

ADDITIONALLY THE CHESS COMPUTER DOES NOT COMMUNICATE ALL OF THE MOVES IT INTENDS TO MAKE TO ITS OPPONENT THE COMPUTER EFFECTIVELY CONCEALS ITS KNOWLEDGE THOUGH THIS IS NOT LYING JUST PART OF THE GAME

NOW SUPPOSE THE CHESS PROGRAM WERE PROGRAMMED TO REPORT CHECKMATE IN 2 MOVES EVEN IN CONTRARY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR OBVIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES WE MIGHT CLASSIFY THIS AS A BUG NOT A LIE BUT IF IT WERE PROGRAMMED TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT ONLY WHEN THE ESCAPE WAS WE MIGHT CONSIDER IT A LIE
OF COURSE IT WOULD BE TRIVIALLY EASY TO PROGRAM THE COMPUTER TO RETURN AN INCORRECT ANSWER TO THE INPUTS BUT DOES THE COMPUTER KNOW THAT THE OUTPUT COMMUNICATES A FALSE THEOREM

ONLY IF IT IS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH WHEN ASKED WHAT IS 2 2 IT EVALUATES THE ANSWER AS AND QUALIFIES THIS EXPRESSION AS TRUE ANY OTHER EVALUATION OF 2 2 MUST BE FALSE NOTABLY IT DOESN'T NEED TO EVALUATE 2 2 AGAIN AND GET A DIFFERENT RESULT IT JUST NEEDS TO MODIFY IT COULD JUST ADD OR SOME OTHER NUMBER TO GET A FALSE RESPONSE WHICH IT COULD USE TO LIE SINCE IT HAS A TRUE AND A FALSE RESPONSE AND CAN CHOOSE WHICH TO OUTPUT AGAIN GIVEN IT KNOWS THE TRUTH THE ACTUAL OUTPUT OF THE EVALUATION OF AN EXPRESSION X IT CAN COMPARE IT TO ANY OTHER ARBITRARY SYMBOL SAY PIZZA AND KNOW IT IS LYING IF IT RESPONDS X IS PIZZA AS LONG AS X ISN'T ACTUALLY PIZZA SO IT CAN SAY 2 2 ITZA AND YOU THEN SAY COME ON QUIT GOOFING AROUND AND IT COULD SAY OK FINE 2 2

THE KEY HERE IS THAT IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE 2 2 IN MORE THAN ONE WAY IT JUST NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE IT AND KNOW IT IS TRUE IT CAN GENERATE AN ARBITRARY RESPONSE COMPARE IT TO THE TRUTH AND IF THEY AREN'T THE SAME THEN AN OUTPUT MAPPING TO THE ARBITRARY RESPONSE IS A LIE AND IT KNOWS IT AND THAT'S HOW WE DO IT TOO
YOU STILL CLAIM A COMPUTER CAN KNOW SOMETHING WHEN YOU ADMITTED TO ME IN THE PREVIOUS THREAD THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT COMPUTERS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL SO YOUR REVISED PRESENTATION IS JUST AS WRONG AS YOUR LAST ONE

SECONDLY PRINT 2 2 IS A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT LIES THE FACT THAT YOU ATTEMPT TO OBFUSCATE AROUND THIS PROBLEM DOESN'T MOVE ME THIS EXAMPLE FALSIFIES YOUR ENTIRE ARGUMENT

I DON'T SEE ANY IMPROVEMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS VERSION SINCE YOU HAVE THE SAME CORE MISTAKES IN BOTH VERSIONS IF ANYTHING THE SECOND VERSION IS WORSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE PARAGRAPHS OF TEXT WHEREAS YOUR FIRST VERSION AT LEAST HAD NUMBERED POINTS THAT PEOPLE COULD ENGAGE WITH
A COUPLE OF THINGS

ARGUMENT DEF THAT'S NOT REALLY HOW HUMANS LIE SO YOU'RE STILL APPLYING DIFFERENT CRITERION TO HUMANS THAN TO COMPUTERS I DON'T GIVE A FORMAL PROOF THAT SOME STATEMENT I'M MAKING IS TRUE WHEN I LIE I JUST CLAIM IT IF I DID MAKE A FORMAL PROOF THAT A STATEMENT WERE TRUE BUT STILL DIDN'T BELIEVE IT THAT WOULD BE WEIRD AND I'D ALMOST ASSUREDLY BE DOING IT FOR A REASON EQUALLY AVAILABLE TO A COMPUTER

ARGUMENT PREMISE YOU'VE GOT A FEW PROBLEMS HERE
YOU'RE ASSUMING THE COMPUTER'S BELIEF SYSTEM IS IN SOME FORMAL LANGUAGE L WITH FORMAL RULES OF INFERENCE IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT YOUR COMPUTER IS DOING STATISTICAL INFERENCE AND ONLY HAS CONFIDENCE LEVELS IN BELIEFS
IF THE COMPUTER LEARNS FROM INTERACTING WITH THE WORLD THIS KNOWLEDGE ISN'T EMBEDDED AS AXIOMS IN THE LANGUAGE L BUT WOULD BE KNOWN BY THE COMPUTER SO THE WHOLE PREMISE IS FALSE

ARGUMENT PREMISE 2
YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT THE LANGUAGE RULES OF INFERENCE AND AXIOMS ARE IDENTICAL FOR BOTH THE PROOF OF THE FALSE STATEMENT AND THE INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE PROOF OF THE COMPUTER I CAN EASILY PROVE THAT THERE ARE A FINITE NUMBER OF PRIMES IF I GET A NEW AXIOM THERE ARE NO NUMBERS GREATER THAN BUT IF THE COMPUTER DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THIS NEW AXIOM THERE IS NOT CONFLICT BETWEEN ITS PROOF IN THE LANGUAGE LIE AND ITS PROOF IN THE COMPUTER'S LANGUAGE LINE
HE CAN RETURN 2 2 KNOWING FULL WELL WHAT THAT OUTPUT MEANS AND KNOWING THAT IT IS FALSE

AND THAT WOULDN'T BE A LIE BY YOUR DEFINITION BECAUSE IT'S NOT A FORMAL PROOF
IF THE COMPUTER'S GOAL IS TO KILL IT WILL DECEIVE JUST AS A HUMAN SOLDIER WOULD
THE HUMAN MIND DOES NOT LIE TO ITSELF JUST BECAUSE WE CAN FORM WORDS THAT DO NOT MATCH UP WITH THE RESULTS OF OUR COMPUTATIONS DOES NOT MEAN THAT OUR COMPUTATIONS ARE INCORRECT A COMPUTER GAME CAN SHOW MANY THINGS THAT AREN'T REAL ESSENTIALLY A LIE A COMPUTER CAN CALCULATE CORRECTLY BUT ALSO BE PROGRAMMED TO SHOW A DIFFERENT OUTPUT ON THE SCREEN OR A LIE THE WHOLE PREMISE FOR THIS ARGUMENT IS JUST FALSE

EDIT A WORD
OKAY I'M GONNA KEEP THIS ANSWER SIMPLE SINCE THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF MORE COMPLEX ONES

IN YOUR SCENARIO AND ONLY IN YOUR SCENARIO WHERE YOU LIMITED THE COMPUTER WITH THINGS LIKE

PREMISE 2 IF A COMPUTER KNOWS THEOREM I IS FALSE THEN IT CAN DERIVE I AND CANNOT DERIVE I

PREMISE IF A COMPUTER RUNNING A CONSISTENT PROGRAM DERIVES A THEOREM IT CANNOT DERIVE THE NEGATION OF THIS THEOREM

THEN YES THE HUMAN MIND CANNOT BE A COMPUTER BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HANDICAPPED IT THUS THE RESULT WILL BE HANDICAPPED

BUT COMPUTERS DON'T WORK LIKE THAT THERE IS NO LIMIT LIKE THE ONE YOU PUT IN YOUR SCENARIO

IF ANYONE WANTED TO CREATE A COMPUTER VERSION OF THE HUMAN MIND THEY WILL TEACH THIS BASIC STUFF TO IT FOR SURE BUT THEY WILL ALSO TEACH IT TO THAT OUTCOME MATTERS AND THAT IT CAN EASILY LIE IF THE OUTCOME IS PREFERRED AMONG MANY MANY OTHER THINGS

A VERY EASY PROOF OF THIS IS A LOT OF VIDEO GAMES TODAY THE ENEMY AI CAN TELL YOU THEY LOVE YOU BUT AS SOON AS THEY DECIDE IT'S MORE BENEFICIAL TO TAKE YOUR LAND THEY WILL ATTACK
I WOULD SAY THERE'S A SCENARIO IN WHICH A COMPUTER CAN LIE VIA ADDITIONAL PROCESSING

FOR EXAMPLE IF ASKED DID YOU RUN A REPORT ON SEPTEMBER 1ST AT THE COMPUTER KNOWS THAT IT DID NOT AND THE TRUTHFUL ANSWER IS NUMBER HOWEVER A SUBSEQUENT LIE TO ME ROUTINE MAY BE EXECUTED WHICH INVERTS THE OUTPUT OF THE TRUTHFUL ANSWER SO THAT THE MACHINE SAYS YES

THIS COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE OF COMPETING INPUTS MUCH LIKE THEY COULD OCCUR IN THE HUMAN BRAIN BY DEFAULT A HUMAN WHEN ASKED IF THEY PERFORMED A TASK COULD BE MOTIVATED TO LIE BECAUSE THE EXPECTED RESULT OF TELLING THE TRUTH IS NEGATIVE

DID YOU TAKE OUT THE TRASH
THINKS TO SELF NO I DIDN'T BUT IF I SAY NO THERE WILL BE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO MITIGATE THOSE CONSEQUENCES I CAN SAY YES INSTEAD
YES

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE COMPUTER DISCUSSION IS SIMPLY THAT A LIE IS A PURPOSEFUL MISCOMMUNICATION DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE THE APPROPRIATE RESULTS

A NEURAL NETWORK COULD BE PROGRAMMED AND GIVEN THE AGENDA AVOID A NEGATIVE OUTCOME THROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR THE COMPUTE WOULD EVENTUALLY LEARN THAT SOMETIMES THE TRUTH LEADS TO A NEGATIVE OUTCOME WHEN A LIE WOULD NOT THEREFORE IT RUNS THE LIE TO ME SUBROUTINE AFTER CALCULATING THE TRUTH SO AS TO MITIGATE A NEGATIVE OUTCOME
FAULTY FROM THE START

IF THE PERSON REQUESTING THE INFORMATION FROM ME IS NOT IN THE LIST OF TRUSTED PERSONS FOR THAT INFORMATION THEN REPORT OTHER INFORMATION OR EVADE IT'S JUST AS EASY TO WRITE INTO A COMPUTER PROGRAM AS IT IS FOR ADULT HUMANS TO DO IT'S HOW FIREBALLS AND FILE PERMISSIONS WORK
I FEEL YOUR DEFINITION OF A COMPUTER IS FLAWED YOUR DEFINITION ESSENTIALLY DEFINES COMPUTERS AS LOGICAL UNITS WHICH PURELY OPTIMISE FOR TRUTH HOWEVER THIS DEFINITION PRECLUDES COMPUTERS DISPLAYING HIGHER ORDERS OF THINKING WHICH IS ARTIFICIALLY STRICT IF YOU WERE TO IMPOSE THE SAME RESTRICTION ON THE HUMAN MIND THE MIND WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO ONLY THE LOGICAL CENTRES OF THE BRAIN THE PART OF YOU DEEP DOWN INSIDE THAT KNOWS WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS TRUE OR FALSE THE PURELY LOGICAL CENTRES OF THE MIND ALSO CANNOT DERIVE A STATEMENT AND ITS NEGATION IT CANNOT LIE BY YOUR LOGIC

COMPUTERS CAN BE PROGRAMMED TO OPTIMISE FOR QUANTITIES OTHER THAN PURELY TRUTH WHICH WILL ENABLE THEM TO OUTPUT STATEMENTS THAT ITS LOGICAL CORE MAY KNOW TO BE FALSE TO ILLUSTRATE THIS I WILL BORROW YOUR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT OF A COMPUTER CALCULATING 2 2 SUPPOSE A COMPUTER IS PROGRAMMED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION SUPPOSE THAT ITS MAIN PROGRAM FIRST CALLS ON ITS PURELY LOGICAL SUBROUTINE AND FEEDS IT THE QUESTION THE LOGICAL SUBROUTINE RETURNS THE STATEMENT 2 2 AS TRUE THE MAIN PROGRAM NOW ADDS THIS STATEMENT 2 2 TO ITS LIST OF TRUE STATEMENTS AND THE OPPOSITE STATEMENT 2 2 TO ITS LIST OF FALSE STATEMENTS NOW SUPPOSE THAT IT IS KNOWN THAT THE COMPUTER WILL BE DESTROYED IF THE MAIN PROGRAM RETURNS ANYTHING OTHER THAN 2 2 WHERE IT IS KNOWN MEANS THAT THIS INFORMATION IS IN THE LIST OF TRUE STATEMENTS SUPPOSE THAT THE PROGRAM ASSIGNS A HIGHLY NEGATIVE UTILITY SCORE TO BEING DESTROYED THE MAIN PROGRAM NOW OPTIMISING FOR UTILITY NOT TRUTH CAN NOW RETURN 2 2 TO PREVENT ITSELF FROM BEING DESTROYED EVEN THOUGH 2 2 IS IN ITS TRUE STATEMENTS LIST AND 2 2 IS A SUBSTATEMENT OF 2 2 WHICH IS IN ITS FALSE STATEMENTS LIST I EAST 2 2 IS KNOWN TO BE FALSE

YOUR OMISSION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF HIGHER ORDER THINKING IN COMPUTERS WHICH RESTRICTS COMPUTERS TO MERELY PURE LOGICAL ANALYSIS IS THE FLAW IN YOUR ARGUMENT THAT LEADS TO ITS INCORRECT CONCLUSION YOUR IDEA OF COMPUTERS SOLELY DERIVING LOGICAL TRUTHS MISSES THE FACT THAT LYING IS A THOUGHT WHERE TRUTH IS NOT THE MAIN OBJECTIVE SOUGHT


IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY WITH YOUR PREMISES YOUR WORDING ISN'T VERY CLEAR

HERE IS A PROGRAM THAT KNOWS THE SUM OF 2 NUMBERS IT IS LITERALLY STORED IN THE COMPUTER'S MEMORY AND IT TELLS YOU AN ANSWER THAT IS NOT THE SUM


CLASS PROGRAM

STATIC VOID MAIN STRING AGS

ENTER THE FIRST NUMBER
INT VAL

ENTER THE SECOND NUMBER
INT VAL 2

VAR WHATIKNOWTHESUMTOBE VAL VAL 2

VAR WHATIWILLTELLTHEUSER WHATIKNOWTHESUMTOBE

2 VAL VAL 2 WHATIWILLTELLTHEUSER



WHY DOES THIS NOT COUNT AS A LIE
YOU ASK ME A QUESTION AND I SAW SOMETHING INCORRECT HOW CAN YOU TELL IF I'M LYING OR NOT YOU SAID
TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS A LIE PER THE DEFINITION GIVEN THEN YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT KNOWS WHAT ITS OUTPUT MEANS I EAST IT HAS TO KNOW THE SEMANTIC VALUE OUT ITS OUTPUT AND IT HAS TO KNOW THAT IT IS FALSE IN YOUR EXAMPLE THE OUTPUT WOULD BE PRODUCED BY A PERFECTLY VALID MATHEMATICAL THEOREM IN THE MACHINE LANGUAGE WE WOULD SEE IN THE OUTPUT AN IDEA THAT IS EXPRESSED WHICH IS FALSE BUT TO THE MACHINE IT WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT IDEA WE ATTACHED TO THAT OUTPUT FROM THE MACHINES PERSPECTIVE THE IDEA THEOREM CONTAINED IN THE MESSAGE IS A VALID MATHEMATICAL THEOREM IT DERIVED TO PRODUCE IT

HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW THE SEMANTIC CONTENT OF WHAT I'M SAYING

SEPARATELY I THINK THIS IS A BAD DEFINITION OF LYING BUT I DO THINK IT'S ALSO AN INDEFENSIBLE ONE
THIS IS A SLIGHT TANGENT FROM YOUR MAIN ARGUMENT BUT I FEEL IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WITHIN YOUR IDEAS HOW AND TO SOME DEGREE WHY THE LIES ARE GENERATED BY HUMANS

MY MAIN PROBLEM IS WITH YOUR DESCRIPTION OF A LIE IS THAT IT IS SIMPLY DEFINED AS NEGATION OF TRUTH AND DOESN'T CONSIDER MOTIVATION

A LIE IN MY OPINION IS MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT I THINK MOTIVATION AND LEARNING NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING THE PROCESS BY WHICH A HUMAN LIES

THE RELATIVE TRUTH IDEA IS THE DEEP UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR REALITY IS PERCEPTION BASED AND WHILE SOMETIMES FAULTY WE MUST MAKE THE BEST ASSUMPTIONS BASED OFF OF RESPONSE TO OUR PAST OUTPUTS THIS CAN LEAD TO A VARIETY OF ACTIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH MOTIVATION

MOTIVATION TOWARD A SPECIFIC GOAL SEEMS TO ME REASON ENOUGH TO GIVE A VARIETY OF OUTPUTS BASED ON POTENTIAL EFFECT RATHER THAN ITS STATUS AS SIMPLY TRUE OR FALSE

IF I'M TAKING A MATH TEST I WILL HAVE MOTIVATION TO SAY 2 2 IF I AM MOTIVATED TO PROVE I CAN LIE I CAN SAY 2 2 ANYTHING ELSE A COMPUTER CAN BE PROGRAMMED TO KNOW THE CORRECT ANSWER BUT FURTHERMORE BE PROGRAMMED TO UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE A UNDER A TEST ON WHETHER IT CAN LIE RESPOND TO CONDITIONS AND EITHER MANIPULATE THE KNOWN CORRECT ANSWER IN A SET WAY MAKING IT A LIE OR GIVE THE KNOWN CORRECT ANSWER

WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE LEARNING AND RELATIVE TRUTH CAPABILITY OF THE HUMAN MIND THAT IS NOT SEEN IN MODERN COMPUTERS THE THOUGHT ALSO GOES DEEPER ALL OF THE KNOWN DATA IN OUR MINDS IS NEVER REALLY KNOWN BUT INSTEAD ASSUMED BASED OFF OF THE CULMINATION OF ALL OF OUR EXPERIENCES AND OBSERVED REACTIONS TO OUR ACTIONS

WHEN I LIE I DON'T THINK SO MUCH I MUST NEGATE WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH BUT RATHER BASED OFF OF MY EXPERIENCES WHAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO SAY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOME THIS COULD BE TELLING JOKE THAT IS NOT TRUE OR TRYING TO SPARE SOMEONE'S FEELINGS I DON'T TELL HE LIE AS A FUNCTION OF NEGATING THE TRUTH BUT RATHER AS ON OF PURSUING AN ALTERNATIVE OUTPUT BASED ON PROJECTIONS FROM MY DATABASE OF RELATIVE KNOWLEDGE
INTERESTING ARGUMENT MOST OF THESE COMMENTS ARE DEBATING WHETHER A COMPUTER IS AN ACCURATE ANALOG OF A BRAIN OR WHETHER ANYONE CAN KNOW ANYTHING BUT I THINK YOUR ARGUMENT CAN BE REFUTED BY LOOKING AT A BROADER DEFINITION OF LYING



THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT YOU'VE SIMPLIFIED AN ADVANCED SOCIAL BEHAVIOR BY NOT CONSIDERING THE REASON WHY PEOPLE LIE PEOPLE LIE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO INFLUENCE THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHERS IT IS A MANIFESTATION OF OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT AN OUTCOME SUZY WILL LIE TO BOB BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T WANT HIM TO FIND OUT ABOUT HER AFFAIR SHE HAS A COVERT GOAL AND SHE CAN GUESS HOW BOB WILL RESPOND TO HER FALSE STORY



IF A COMPUTER HAD EVEN A SLIPPERY GRASP OF HOW A HUMAN WOULD RESPOND TO A MULTITUDE OF OUTPUTS THEN THE COMPUTER COULD SELECT AN OUTPUT IT KNEW TO BE FALSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ALTER A HUMANS BEHAVIOR TO ITS BENEFIT LYING IS AN ADVANCED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE IT REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOUR OUTPUTS ARE RECEIVED HOW THEY WILL BE PROCESSED AND ALSO WHAT INFORMATION YOUR TARGET ALREADY HAS IN ORDER TO PERFORM THIS STRATEGY AN AI WOULD HAVE TO SIMULATE A SIMPLIFIED HUMAN RESPONSE TO ITS ACTIONS


THAT BEING SAID THERE IS NOTHING MAGICAL ABOUT A LIE YOU DON'T NEED AN ORGANIC BRAIN AN ETHEREAL CONSCIOUSNESS OR A SOUL TO LEARN HOW YOUR OUTPUTS WILL AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHERS YOU JUST NEED THE ABILITY TO LEARN AND THE ABILITY TO PREDICTION THIS IS WHAT THE HUMAN BRAIN EXCELS AT BABIES ARE FIGURING OUT HOW TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY CAN CRAWL I AM CONFIDENT WE WILL HAVE LYING AIS AS SOON AS WE PROGRAM THEM TO LEARN HOW THEIR OUTPUTS AFFECT THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND GIVE THEM A GOAL




PREMISE A COMPUTER CAN KNOW THEOREM I IS EXPRESSED BY OUTPUT P IF AND ONLY IF THE COMPUTER EXECUTES OUTPUT P ONLY WHEN I IS DERIVED IN THE COMPUTER S PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE L BY THE COMPUTER

IT IS TRIVIAL TO WRITE CODE THAT BREAKS THIS PREMISE BY EXECUTING OUTPUT P WHEN I IS DERIVED UNDER WHATEVER CONDITIONS ARE CHOSEN TO TRIGGER THE COMPUTER TO LIE

FOR EXAMPLE GIVE THE COMPUTER INPUTS OF 2 2 THE COMPUTER CALCULATES AN ANSWER OF 2 2 AND THEN DECIDES WHETHER TO GIVE A GIVE A TRUE OR FALSE OUTPUT IF IT DECIDES TO LIE THEN IT CAN OUTPUT 2 2 NOT AS A RESULT OF THE CALCULATION BUT AS A RESULT OF DECIDING TO LIE

ACCEPT INPUT
ANSWER CALCULATE TRUE RESPONSE INPUT
IF TELLTRUTH THEN
OUTPUT ANSWER
ELSE
OUTPUT NOT ANSWER
I THINK SEARLE HAS THIS RIGHT A BRAIN CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A DIGITAL COMPUTER BECAUSE ANYTHING OF SUFFICIENT COMPLEXITY CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A DIGITAL COMPUTER BUT THE BRAIN DOESN'T DO WHAT IT DOES CONSCIOUSNESS THOUGHTS BY VIRTUE OF ITS BEING A DIGITAL COMPUTER

A DIGITAL COMPUTER A PC FOR EXAMPLE DOESN'T HAVE ANY THOUGHTS WE HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT IT THAT'S ALL
NOT A PHILOSOPHER SO BARE WITH ME OR REPORT THE COMMENT

YOUR SYMBOLIC VERSION IS MUCH CLEARER FOR ME THAN YOU TEXT SORRY

YOUR PREMISE IS

X M X X M X X D X

FIRST OF ALL THE M X IS NOT NECESSARY I THINK AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE ADDED WHAT YOU WANT TO PROVE HERE

YOU SAY THAT IF THE MACHINE KNOWS THAT OUTPUT P EXPRESSES PHI X THEN IF THE MACHINE EXECUTES OUTPUT P IT MUST MEAN THAT IS HAS DERIVED PHI X AND THIS IS ONE OF YOUR PREMISES IS THAT CORRECT
I DO NOT THINK THE OP UNDERSTANDS COMPUTER PROGRAMMING WELL ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND WHY NONE OF THIS IS EVEN REMOTELY VALID

COMPUTER PROGRAMS ARE LIKE RUBE GOLDBERG MACHINES MADE OUT OF WORDS

THEY DO NOT THINK AND THE COMPUTER IS AWARE OF NOTHING
THAT SECOND LEVEL OF MORAL COMPLEXITY CERTAINLY DOES MAKE THE PROBLEM A DEEPER QUANDARY BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THE MORE POPULAR VERSION IS WRONG PER SE THE QUESTION IS NOT ONLY LIFE VS LIVES BUT ACTION VS INACTION IT'S ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE AN ACTION THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO PERSON'S DEATH OR WILL YOU ALLOW PEOPLE TO DIE BUT THROUGH NO ACTION OF YOUR OWN THAT IDEA OF ACTUALLY TAKING AN ACTION THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO SOMEONE'S DEATH IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE FIND CHALLENGING ABOUT THE SCENARIO

I HADN'T HEARD THE VERSION OF THE PROBLEM YOU DESCRIBED AND I LIKE IT BUT THE VERSION THAT GETS THROWN AROUND MOST IS MORE EASILY PACKAGED AND STILL PRESENTS A CHALLENGING AND MORAL CHOICE TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T OFTEN THINK ABOUT ETHICAL PROBLEMS
I THINK YOU SHOULD ASK AN ACTUAL 2 YEAR-OLD CHILD THEN

WATCH V

JOKING ASIDE I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE NEXT PART WITH PUSHING THE FAT MAN OFF THE BRIDGE IS SUPPOSED TO TESTAMENT ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE THE LIFE OF SOMEONE WHO IS INNOCENT AND NOT BREAKING RULES TO SAVE THE FIVE THE FAT MAN THEN SUBSTITUTES FOR YOUR INNOCENT CHILD
WHEN PHILIPA FOOT FIRST INTRODUCED THIS PROBLEM IT WAS IN A FEW ITERATIONS AMONG WHICH THERE IS THE ONE DENOUNCED BY YOU HERE

SUPPOSE THAT A JUDGE OR MAGISTRATE IS FACED WITH RIOTERS DEMANDING THAT A CULPRIT BE FOUND FOR A CERTAIN CRIME AND THREATENING OTHERWISE TO TAKE THEIR OWN BLOODY REVENGE ON A PARTICULAR SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY THE REAL CULPRIT BEING UNKNOWN THE JUDGE SEES HIMSELF AS ABLE TO PREVENT THE BLOODSHED ONLY BY FRAMING SOME INNOCENT PERSON AND HAVING HIM EXECUTED BESIDE THIS EXAMPLE IS PLACED ANOTHER IN WHICH A PILOT WHOSE AIRPLANE IS ABOUT TO CRASH IS DECIDING WHETHER TO STEER FROM A MORE TO A LESS INHABITED AREA TO MAKE THE PARALLEL AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE IT MAY RATHER BE SUPPOSED THAT HE IS THE DRIVER OF A RUNAWAY TRAM WHICH HE CAN ONLY STEER FROM ONE NARROW TRACK ON TO ANOTHER FIVE MEN ARE WORKING ON ONE TRACK AND ONE MAN ON THE OTHER ANYONE ON THE TRACK HE ENTERS IS BOUND TO BE KILLED IN THE CASE OF THE RIOTS THE MOB HAVE FIVE HOSTAGES SO THAT IN BOTH EXAMPLES THE EXCHANGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONE MAN'S LIFE FOR THE LIVES OF FIVE
HOWEVER THE TRAIN PROBLEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ETHICAL DILEMMA I EAST INVOLVING MORE THAN JUST YOUR OWN QUALMS ABOUT YOUR ACTIONS BUT ALSO YOUR THINKING ABOUT OTHERS DECISIONS AND YOUR JUDGEMENT

SAYS WHO THE ORIGINAL TROLLEY PROBLEM IS AS DEPICTED IN THE IMAGE EXCEPT INSTEAD OF PEOPLE TIED UP IT'S WORKERS WORKING ON THE TRACKS YOU SEEM TO HAVE THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE THE KING OF TROLLEY PROBLEMS WHO IS IN CHARGE OF TELLING US WHAT THE RIGHT AND WRONG TROLLEY PROBLEMS ARE BUT THAT'S FALSE IF IN CHARGE OF IT IT'S THE PERSON WHO FIRST INTRODUCED THE PROBLEM TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL COMMUNITY PHILIPPA FOOT WHO INTRODUCED IT IN THE VERSION YOU SEEM TO THINK IS SOMEHOW WRONG
I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST ADD THE TRAIN DERAILS AND KILLS MORE PEOPLE PART ARMED WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE YOURE AGAIN NEGATING THE MORAL DELIMMA OF BREAKING FOLLOWING THE RULES IT'S EITHER KID FOLLOWING THE RULES OR THAT CHOSE TO BREAK THEM AND PUT THEMSELVES IN WAY

EDIT DERAILS NOT DETAILS
THE ORIGINAL IS NOT INCORRECT IT'S THE BASE VERSION AT LEAST AS FAR AS I'M AWARE

THE BASE DILEMMA IS MEANT TO SHOW A BASIC PROBLEM OF THE GREATER GOOD WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE ON THE TRACK WE'RE ALMOST FORCED TO LOOK AT IT AS BASIC MATHEMATICS BY SWITCHING THE TRACK YOU HAVE A NET GAIN OF PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PEOPLE WE JUST DEFAULT TO GETTING THE GREATER GOOD FOR THE MOST PEOPLE HENCE MOST PEOPLE FLIP THE SWITCH

OF COURSE YOUR IDEAS ABOUT LIFE FATE DESTINY ETC MAY PLAY ON YOUR DECISION

I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE TROLLEY PROBLEM IN AN ESSAY ON UTILITARIANISM IN BATMAN THE JOKER KILLS PEOPLE BATMAN CATCHES HIM BUT THE JOKER ALWAYS ESCAPES AND KILLS MORE PEOPLE IF BATMAN KILLS THE JOKER HE'D SAVE THE LIVES OF ALL FUTURE VICTIMS BUT HE DOESN'T IS HE ACTING MORALLY IN THIS CASE
YOU ARE JUST CREATING A NEW VARIATION ON THE ORIGINAL SO HOW ABOUT THIS ONE HILLARY IS ON ONE TRACK AND TRUMP IS ON THE OTHER WHAT DO YOU DO


EH NUMBER THE TROLLEY PROBLEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE JUST THAT BECAUSE IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR HARD DEONTOLOGIST

THE TRAIN IS GOING TO KILL PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T ACT HOWEVER IF YOU DO ACT YOU'D BE KILLING A HUMAN WHICH CONTRADICTS THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE THE SAVING OF THE PEOPLE DOES NOT BALANCE THE KILLING OF AT LEAST FOR DEONTOLOGIST

A FEW ISSUES I HAVE

THE AUTHOR PRESUMES A DEFINITION OF GOOD NAMELY HUMAN FLOURISHING A GREAT DEAL OF THE DEBATE WITHIN ETHICS CENTERS ON JUST THAT THE DEFINITION OF GOOD IF THE KANTIANS ARE CORRECT OUTCOMES INCLUDING HUMAN FLOURISHING HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MORALITY IF UTILITARIANS ARE CORRECT BUT THE AVERAGE HUMAN UTILITY IS NEGATIVE DUE TO PAIN OUTWEIGHING PLEASURE ON AVERAGE THEN HUMAN EXTINCTION IS PREFERABLE TO CONTINUED EXISTENCE OBJECTIVITY CAN BE OBTAINED BUT ONLY BY FIRST AGREEING TO A DEFINITION OF GOOD WHICH WE DON'T HAVE

2 THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT MOST MORAL ARGUMENTS ARE PERIPHERAL IN NATURE BUT THE CORE OF THE DEBATE IS AGREED UPON IT IS PRECISELY THE CORE OF MORALITY WHICH IS AT STAKE A THEOLOGICAL MORALITY WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT THAN A KANTIAN OR CONSEQUENTIALIST MORALITY FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WHETHER PAIN OUTWEIGHS PLEASURE WHETHER ACTION SUPERCEDES INACTION OR WHETHER SMALL SINS CAN BE TOLERATED IN SERVICE OF A GREATER GOOD ARE ALL MASSIVE QUESTIONS WITH LARGE IMPLICATIONS NOT PERIPHERAL AT ALL

I THINK ALMOST ALL OF THE AUTHORS POINTS HOLD IF WE TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT MORALITY HUMAN FLOURISHING BUT IF WE CHALLENGE THAT FUNDAMENTAL POINT THEN THE ARGUMENT LOSES SOME OF ITS VALUE
IN PART HOBBES AND THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE PRINCE OF OUR ON-GOING SERIES ON THE TRANSITION FROM LIBERAL DEMOCRACY TO AUTHORITARIAN DEMOCRACY WE EXPLORE THE WAY HOBBES AGREED WITH FUNDAMENTAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS AND THE NATURAL WORLD BUT REJECTED POLITICAL SOLUTION IN THIS EPISODE WE IDENTIFY HOW HOBBES DEMOCRATIZES THE PRINCE AND IN DOING SO CREATES A OF AUTHORITARIAN DEMOCRACY THIS MOVE IS BOTH ESSENTIAL FOR THE ULTIMATE FORMATION OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY AND LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR ITS RETURN TO AUTHORITARIAN DEMOCRACY ENJOY
COULD SOMEONE PROVIDE LINKS TO THE EARLIER PODCASTS THANKS
I'M MORE OF A CALVINIST MYSELF
REMOVED
REMOVED
INTERESTING READ NOW ONLY IF THOSE MEATBALLS IN WASHINGTON COULD GET ON BOARD WITH THESE SCIENCES AND THOUGHTS WE NEED MORE THOUGHTS IN OUR POLITICIANS
SO I'M A LAYMAN WHEN IT COMES TO PHILOSOPHY BUT I FIND THE EXAMPLES PRESENTED IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE BLOG TO BE LESS THAN COMPELLING THE SIGNIFICANCE BETWEEN A BUTTON THAT KEEPS A PLANE FLYING WHEN HELD DOWN VERSUS A BUTTON THAT CRASHES THE PLANE SEEMS SEMANTICAL IN BOTH CASES THERE IS AN ACTION THAT COULD BE TAKEN BY A PILOT THAT COULD CAUSE THE PLANE TO CRASH THE PHRASING IN THIS SITUATION PRESUPPOSES POSSIBLE CAUSES IN BOTH SITUATIONS BUT I'M CONFUSED BY THE RELEVANCE OF THE AUTHOR LINKS THE POTENTIALITY OF ONE ACTION TO CAUSE A BAD RESULT AND IT SEEMS LIKE SHE DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT WE NEED TO TREAT ALL POTENTIAL ACTIONS SIMILARLY

I FEEL AS THOUGH ONE CAN DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL CAUSES IN A MEANINGFUL SENSE THE BULLET THAT KILLED THE TARGET WAS FIRED BY BILLY HOLDING SUZY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH IS INCORRECT BECAUSE HER ACTIONS WOULD ONLY HAVE RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF THE TARGET HAD BILLY NOT ACTED IF WE CONSIDER THE ENTIRE SCENARIO CAUSATION IS CLEAR IT'S ONLY BY ADDING IN COUNTERFACTUAL SCENARIOS THAT WE GET A CULPABILITY FOR SUZY IN THE ACTUAL DEATH RATHER THAN THE ATTEMPT IN ADDITION TO WHAT DEGREE DOES KNOWLEDGE AND INTENT COME INTO PLAY HERE HAD BILLY MISSED ON PURPOSE KNOWING OF SMART BULLET WOULD HE BE CULPABLE IS THERE A LEVEL OF BLAME TO BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER PARTY BASED ON THE GUARANTEED NATURE OF THE DEATH
IN MOST OF CONTINENTAL EUROPE THE ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED BY JURISPRUDENCE EONS AGO BASICALLY THE INTENTION TO HARM IS SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THE CAUSATION AND INTENTIONALITY EVEN THOUGH THE INTENTION CONSIDERED THE OCCURRENCE ONLY AS AN EVENTUALITY MORE OR LESS REMOTE

AN EXAMPLE SOMEONE IS SHOOTING WITH A GUN FROM A WINDOW TO A WALL OF THE OPPOSIT BUILDING BULLETS REACH THE WALL JUST FEW INCHES ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE PASSERS BY IN THE STREET

ONE OF THE BULLET HAPPENS TO HIT IN THE HEAD ONE OF THE PASSERS BY WHO DIE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE SHOOTER DID NOT HAVE THE INTENTION TO KILL SPECIFICALLY THIS PERSON NOR NECESSARILY TO KILL ANYBODY BUT HE SURELY CONSIDERED AND ACCEPTED THE EVENTUALITY THAT SOMEONE COULD BE HARMED IN THE PROCESS EVEN KILLED

AT THE TRIAL THE SHOOTER IS INDICTED FOR INTENTIONAL HOMICIDE AND MOST LIKELY FOUND GUILTY
PRETTY SURE IT'S BERNSTEIN
BUT WHAT DOES DESCARTES DO WITH HIS FRESH START HE TELLS US THAT ONE THING IS CLEAR GOD EXISTS

THIS IS NOT ALL DESCARTES GIVES US IN FACT I'D ARGUE THAT THE GOD STUFF DOESN'T REALLY DETRACT THAT MUCH FROM WHAT DESCARTES REALLY GIVES US IN THE MEDITATIONS WHICH IS METHODOLOGICAL DOUBT AND THE CONCLUSION OF THE INDUBITABLE MIND

NEITHER BELIEVERS OR WOULD CONSIDER THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IS SELF-EVIDENT

FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH HE DOES PROVIDE AN ARGUMENT FOR GOD'S EXISTENCE IT'S NOT A GOOD ARGUMENT BUT IT'S MORE THAN SAYING THAT GOD IS SELF-EVIDENT

MY PURPOSE IN THIS BLOG IS TO USE THE FRESH START GIVEN TO US BY DESCARTES AND TO SEE WHERE I CAN GO WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT SOME TRANSCENDENT BEING IS IN CHARGE

HAVE YOU CHECKED OUT HUSSERL

HELLO CASPAR

I'M A NEUROPSYCHOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY STUDENT IN SWEDEN AIMING ALOT OF MY ATTENTION FORWARDS CONSCIOUSNESS NOT BEING FAMILIAR WITH YOUR OWN WRITINGS WHAT IS YOUR APPROACH TO CONSCIOUSNESS ANY COMMENTS ON ELIMINATIVISM VS PANPSYCHISM DO YOU SEE CONSCIOUSNESS BEING A BRIDGING TOPIC FOR DISCIPLINES LIKE PHILOSOPHY AND NEUROSCIENCE

ALSO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS OF PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES LSD PSILOCYBIN DMT ETC AS A TOOL IN PHILOSOPHY DO YOU TAKE ANY REPORTS ON THESE MIND ALTERING DRUGS TO BE OF USE IN DISCUSSING A THE NATURE OF REALITY

HI CASPER

IS THE WESTERN WORLD OF PHILOSOPHY AND ACADEMIA MISSING OUT BY WAY OF A MARKED NEGLIGENCE ON TEACHING POTENTIAL STUDENTS THE PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES OF THE EASTERN WORLD I EAST ASIAN CHINESE ISLAMIC ETC
PROFESSOR HARE

THANKS FOR JOINING US VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE

DO YOU FEEL ANY SPECIAL DUTY TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT AS A PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR ESPECIALLY ONE WORKING ON ETHICS WHAT KINDS OF THINGS DO YOU THINK ETHICISTS SHOULD BE DOING OR WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM DOING OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIA
HI PROFESSOR HARE I WAS HOPING TO ASK ABOUT YOUR MDOC SOME ACADEMICS ARE CONCERNED THAT MOOCH ARE DAMAGING ACADEMIA AS WE KNOW IT FOR EXAMPLE BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF OPEN POSITIONS FOR YOUNGER PHS AND BY LOWERING THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AT SCHOOLS LICENSING MOOCH FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS

WHAT DO YOU SAY TO ASSUAGE PEOPLE'S WORRIES ABOUT THESE TYPES OF COURSES

ALSO I WAS HOPING YOU COULD SAY A BIT ABOUT WHAT MOTIVATED YOU TO GO TOWARDS A MODEL IF POSSIBLE
HI PROF

WANTED TO KNOW HOW IS PHIL INVESTIGATIONS GENERALLY RECEIVED BY ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHERS WORKING ON PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY I SEE SOME STUFF ON ASPECT CHANGE FAMILY RESEMBLANCES LANGUAGE GAMES OBVIOUSLY BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM OUTSIDE OF THAT THERE'S MUCH STUFF EMPLOYED IN THE METAPHYSIC MORAL PHIL LITERATURE IS IT BECAUSE PI LACKS A CERTAIN AN ARGUMENTATIVE FRAMEWORK CURIOUS ON YOUR THOUGHTS
HI PROFESSOR HARE

JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING YOUR COURSE ON PHILOSOPHY FREE I ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT EDUCATION SHOULD NOT SOLELY BE THE REALM OF THE WEALTHY

SOME QUICK QUESTIONS
COMPARED TO CLASSICAL TIMES WHERE RHETORIC AND PHILOSOPHY SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERED HALLMARKS OF AN EDUCATED MAN DO YOU FEEL THAT THE LACK OF SUCH VIRTUES IN SOCIETY HAVE AN BEARING TOWARDS IT'S CURRENT TREND TOWARDS RADICALISM

2 WHAT WOULD YOU HOPE THAT PEOPLE WOULD TAKE AWAY AFTER COMPLETING YOUR COURSE

THANK YOU


HELLO PROFESSOR HARE

THANKS FOR DOING THE AMA

I CAN'T THINK OF ANY REALLY INVOLVED QUESTION SO HERE'S PERHAPS AN EASIER ONE WHO IS ARE PHILOSOPHER S THAT YOU FEEL IS ARE CURRENTLY NEGLECTED
HERE'S A QUESTION FROM U METAPHILOSOPHER

HELLO PROFESSOR HARE FROM ALL THE COURSES IN PHILOSOPHY I'VE TAKEN SO FAR YOURS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE

ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY SEEMS TO BE GOING DOWNHILL WITH OF DEPARTMENTS AND PROMINENT FIGURES CRITICIZING THE FIELD WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING DONE TO IMPROVE ITS SECURITY

2 SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT PHILOSOPHY ISN'T SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE WELL WHAT IS EXPERTISE IN PHILOSOPHY HOW TO DISTINGUISH A GOOD PHILOSOPHER FROM A BAD ONE

HOW DID YOU BECOME INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO PURSUE PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHY

AS A BEGINNER PHILOSOPHY STUDENT IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO START WITH IN MY RESEARCH TO BUILD A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION AND MOVE TO NORMATIVE ETHICS AND PRACTICAL ETHICS LATER
HI PROFESSOR HARE THANKS FOR YOUR TIME

WHAT POSITIONS DID YOU ONCE HOLD WHICH YOU NOW STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND
HI PROFESSOR HARE

WHAT OR YOU FEEL MOST DECISIVELY INFLUENCED YOUR DEVELOPMENT WHICH BOOKS WOULD YOU NOW SUGGEST AS MOST HELPFUL TO YOUNG PEOPLE OR THOSE FIRST GETTING INTO PHILOSOPHY
DID YOU EVER SEE THE PHILOSOPHER'S SOCCER SKETCH ON PYTHON HOW ACCURATE IS IT TO HISTORICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF PHILOSOPHERS
IN YOUR CLASS YOU TALK ABOUT ARGUMENTS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD IN YOUR ESTIMATION WHAT IS THE BEST OVERALL I EAST HARDEST TO REFUTE ONTOLOGICAL OR COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD
HI PROFESSOR HARE

CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS YOU THINK MAKE SOMEONE PROMISING IN PHILOSOPHY WHEN YOU INTERACT WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T FULLY DEVELOPED THEIR PHILOSOPHICAL CAREER WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT TEND TO MAKE YOU THINK THAT A PARTICULAR PERSON MIGHT SHOW PROMISE

IS THERE INSIGHT YOU HAVE AS A PROFESSOR OF MANY COMPLICATED ISSUES WITH WHICH MANY PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC ALREADY HAVE STRONG DEEPLY ENTRENCHED OPINIONS ABOUT THAT CAN EVEN SOMETIMES BE RATHER OVERSIMPLIFIED WITH REGARDS TO MAKING SOMEONE MORE CHARITABLE IN DISCUSSING AN ISSUE IN OTHER WORDS DO YOU DEAL WITH UNCHARITABLE PEOPLE AS A PROFESSOR WHOSE MINDS YOU ARE MEANT TO ENRICH AND IS THERE ANY ADVICE REGARDING THAT THAT MIGHT BE PUT TO USE IN EVERYDAY DISCUSSION OR DO PEOPLE HAVING TO ACTUALLY PAY TO GO TO MIT TEND TO ALWAYS BE CHARITABLE AND OPEN-MINDED AND THIS ISN'T REALLY A PROBLEM

I'M WILLING TO CLEAR ANYTHING UP IF MY QUESTIONS ARE AMBIGUOUS OR POORLY WRITTEN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME
THANKS FOR DOING THIS PROF HARE
DO YOU SHARE THE VIEW OF SOME PHILOSOPHERS AND OR NEUROSCIENTIST THAT WHAT IS COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AS FREE WILL IS A SCIENTIFICALLY TESTABLE CONCEPT IF YES HOW DOES THIS MIGHT AFFECT HOW WE TREAT MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IN SOCIETIES IF DETERMINISM WERE TO BE PROVED TRUE

IN THE BIBLE PSALMS I TOOK YOUR COURSE WHEN IT WAS FIRST AVAILABLE ON DDX AND I ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY
THANK YOU
MANOS
WHAT GOT YOU STARTED IN PHILOSOPHY AND HAS PHILOSOPHY BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT DELIVERING OR MAKING AN IMPACT
DELETED
PROFESSOR HARE

MY NAME IS MIKE I'LL BE TAKING YOUR SEMINAR TOPICS OF PHILOSOPHY THIS UPCOMING SEMESTER I HOPE TO ATTEND GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR PHILOSOPHY LIKELY FOR ETHICS OR POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY

MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE SO-CALLED IVORY TOWER EFFECT OF ACADEMIA DO YOU THINK PHILOSOPHERS HAVE A DUTY TO CONTRIBUTE TO PUBLIC DISCOURSE RELEVANT TO THEIR FIELD OF EXPERTISE FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD ETHICISTS WEIGH IN ON CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS LIKE WHETHER OR NOT TO GO TO WAR OR ABORTION LIKE JUDITH THOMSON HAS DONE

I'M WORRIED THAT GRADUATE SCHOOL INCENTIVIZES PUBLISHING OVER ALL ELSE LEAVING LITTLE TIME TO BE A PUBLIC INTELLECTUAL

THANK YOU AND SEE YOU SOON
WHY AM I ME WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS I AM A CONSCIOUS BEING SO ARE YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE BUT I EXPERIENCE LIFE THROUGH MY SENSES AND NOT YOURS SO WHY CAN'T MY CONSCIOUSNESS BE IN SOMEONE ELSE I KNOW THAT MY CONSCIOUSNESS IS TIED TO MY BRAIN WHAT I DON'T FOLLOW US WHY THAT MUST BE
HI R PHILOSOPHY SINCE DR HARE IS DONE


BY DEFAULT THE MEDIA SEEMS TO TURN TO EMPIRICAL SCIENTISTS AND OTHER TO PROVIDE AUTHORITATIVE OPINIONS ON PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES SUCH AS CONSCIOUSNESS I RECALL AN INFORGRAPHIC PIECE IN TIME MAGAZINE THAT CONSISTED OF THINKERS ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS QUOTES WERE FROM ON THE BRIGHT SIDE QUOTES WERE CHOPAS


WHAT'S ESPECIALLY FRUSTRATING IS THAT PUBLICIZED PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS INTRODUCED BY EMPIRICAL SCIENTISTS OFTEN SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED WITHOUT A GLANCE AT THE EXTANT LITERATURE


SCIENTISTS ARE REALLY SMART AND SCIENCE JOURNALISTS ARE GENERALLY QUITE GOOD AT SCOURING THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE FOR RELEVANT MATERIAL WHY THEN ARE WE CONSTANTLY FED A STREAM OF ILLITERATE OPINION ON PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES LIKE CONSCIOUSNESS


WHEN WE ARE PRESENTED WITH OPINION ON MATTERS SUCH AS CONSCIOUSNESS TWO THIRDS OF THE TIME IT COMES FROM DANIEL DENNET WHO HOLDS THE FRINGE OPINION THAT QUALIA DON'T EXIST WHY DO WE ALWAYS HEAR FROM HIM IN THE POPULAR MEDIA

IN GENERAL WHY DO WE HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME PROPAGATING WELL-INVESTIGATED IDEAS ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGHOUT THE LARGER CULTURE WHY DO EMPIRICAL SCIENTISTS FEEL SO CONFIDENT TO DISCUSS CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT THE KIND OF CARE THEY APPLY TO OTHER ISSUES
DO YOU THINK ANSELM IS MAKING HASTY GENERALIZATIONS

LOVE YOUR CLASSICAL
WHAT DO YOU PERSONALLY BELIEVE IS THE MEANING OF LIFE BESIDES THE SCIENCE WAY OF SAYING TO REPRODUCE AND CARRY ON
HELLO PROFESSOR WHAT ARE SOME KEY TEXTS IN ETHICS OR METAETHICS THAT ALL UNDERGRADS SHOULD READ
IF I COULD ASK A SECOND QUESTION THAT RECEIVED A LOT OF ATTENTION ON THIS SUBREDDIT IN A RECENT ARTICLE DANIEL DENNETT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID THAT

A GREAT DEAL OF PHILOSOPHY DOESN T REALLY DESERVE MUCH OF A PLACE OF THE WORLD HE SAYS PHILOSOPHY IN SOME QUARTERS HAS BECOME SELF-INDULGENT CLEVER PLAY IN A VACUUM THAT S NOT DEALING OF PROBLEMS OF ANY INTRINSIC INTEREST

MUCH IF NOT ALL PHILOSOPHICAL WORK IN ANALYTIC METAPHYSICS FOR EXAMPLE IS WILLFULLY CUT OFF FROM ANY SERIOUS ISSUES SAYS DENNETT THE PROBLEM HE EXPLAINS IS THAT CLEVER STUDENTS LOOKING TO SHOW OFF THEIR SKILLS CONCOCT CUTE COUNTERARGUMENT THAT REQUIRE NEITHER TECHNICAL TRAINING NOR EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE THESE THEN BUILD OFF EACH OTHER AND INVADE THE JOURNALS AND PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE

NOW YOUR WORK IS NOTABLE FOR BEING APPROACHABLE AND DEALING WITH SYSTEMATIC ISSUES IN PHILOSOPHY OF THESE TWO CHARACTERISTICS WHICH DO YOU FEEL CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY ON THE WHOLE MOST LACKS APPROACHABLE LANGUAGE OR A LARGER APPROACH TO BROADER ISSUES
HELLO PROFESSOR
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST UNIQUE ASPECT OF TEACHING AT MIT AS OPPOSED TO ANYWHERE ELSE
A QUESTION FROM U LILIUM

HELLO PROFESSOR HARE THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AMA
I LOVE PHILOSOPHY THOUGH I'M NOT IN THE FIELD I TOOK YOUR MDOC INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY AND I PARTICULARLY LOVED THE SECTION ABOUT KNOWLEDGE IT WAS VERY THOUGHT PROVOKING
AS A NURSE I BRIEFLY STUDIED ETHICS AND DEONTOLOGY IN SCHOOL AND I LIKED IT BIOETHICS SPECIFICALLY AND WISH I COULD LEARN MORE ABOUT IT BUT I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO START DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS
HI PROF

DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR TO CLASSIFY THE BELIEF IN PHILOSOPHICAL IDEALISM OR DUALISM AS SUPERNATURAL BELIEFS
WHY ISN'T THERE A PLACE IN THE ACADEMY FOR SERIOUS RIGOROUS YET PERSONAL DISCUSSION OF THE URGENT QUESTION OF HOW EACH OF US SHOULD LIVE LIFE I DON'T MEAN THE DISPASSIONATE EXAMINATION OF SCHOLARLY THEORIES THOUGH THAT TOO IS IMPORTANT I MEAN GRAPPLING WITH THE PERSONAL CHALLENGES THAT EACH OF US FACES IN OUR SPECIFIC LIFE SITUATIONS LOVE GOD DEATH CREATIVE BLOCKS FRIENDSHIP ISSUES POLITICS ETC

CAN ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY BE THE PLACE WE CAN BRING KNOWLEDGE TOGETHER AND CLARIFY WHAT TROUBLES US AND IF NOT WHAT IS
YES I HAVE A QUESTION WHAT JOBS ARE AVAILABLE FOR A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR WITH A DEGREE NOW I'VE BEEN UNEMPLOYED SINCE GRADUATION YEARS AGO ALL THE JOBS I HAVE FOUND ARE TEACHING JOBS WITH UNIVERSITIES OR COLLEGES AND THEY ARE ALL FULL WITH PROFESSORS ALREADY ARE THERE ANY OTHER PLACES YOU KNOW OF FOR A JOB FOR A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR
REMOVED
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THE MULTIVERSE THEORY FROM A PHILOSOPHIC POINT OF VIEW
THERE ARE AN ABUNDANCE OF INTRO LEVEL PHILOSOPHY CLASSES AVAILABLE ON ITUNES AND VARIOUS MDOC SITES I'M CURIOUS IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER PUTTING TOGETHER A MORE ADVANCED CLASS IN PHILOSOPHY SOMETHING APPROPRIATE FOR UPPER LEVEL UNDERGRADUATES A CLASS ON EPISTEMOLOGY OR PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY EAST G WOULD BE PERFECT
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU COULD TELL US BRIEFLY THAT WOULD ENCOMPASS A MAIN MESSAGE WHAT WOULD THAT BE
GREETINGS PROFESSOR HARE IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ELABORATE ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE WORLD TODAY I KNOW THE QUESTION IS QUITE BROAD BUT THE REASON I'M ASKING IT IS THE AMOUNT OF CRITICISM I'VE BEEN SEEING LATELY TOWARDS THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF PHILOSOPHY THAT IT DOES NOT PLAY ANY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE HUMAN CONDITION AT THE PRESENT DAY AND AGE COMPARED TO SCIENCE THANK YOU
WHAT FIVE BOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT ANY WELL-ROUNDED RENAISSANCE MAN READ
PROFESSOR HARE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PHYSICALISM THANK YOU
IS RATIONALITY IN YOUR VIEW NORMATIVE IF SO WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RATIONALITY AND ETHICS
WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON OBJECTIVE MORALITY DOES MORALITY COME NATURALLY TO US OR IS IT CONSTRUCTED
WILL YOU PROVIDE A READING LIST OF WORKS THAT DON'T MAKE THE CUT FOR YOUR COURSES BUT HAVE STRONGLY IMPACTED YOUR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT

THANKS

E LITERATURE NONFICTION FICTION POETRY SCHOLARLY ARTICLES FROM BARELY RELATED FIELDS ANYTHING THAT HAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED YOUR DIRECTION
THIS MAY BE OUT OF YOUR PURVIEW AS IT IS A SOMEWHAT METAETHICAL QUESTION BUT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT ACCOUNTS OF WHY THERE IS A MORALITY RATHER THAN NONE AS IN HOW DOES IT ARISE I'VE PREVIOUSLY BEEN RECOMMENDED THE SOURCES OF NORMATIVITY BY KORSGAARD WHICH LOOKS LIKE A GOOD STARTING POINT BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY SUPPLEMENTARY SUGGESTIONS
WHAT BOOK IN YOUR OPINION IS A MUST READ IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO WESTERN PHILOSOPHY
TAKING MY FIRST PHILOSOPHY CLASS THIS SEMESTER ANY SUGGESTIONS BEFORE I START UP
HI GREAT TO SEE SUCH A POWERFUL MIND ON THIS SUB HAHA I'M A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE SO FAR I'VE TAKEN PRINCIPLES OF SOUND REASONING AND EXISTENTIALISM COVERING FAMOUS EXISTENTIALISTS COVERING HEIDEGGER CAMUS NIETZSCHE KIERKEGAARD DOSTOYEVSKY UNAMUNO JUST TO NAME A FEW AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND WHAT THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAW IS DO YOU THINK GOVERNMENT AND LAW ARE A MORE SO METAPHYSICAL NOTION THAN EPISTEMOLOGICAL OR MORE SO EPISTEMOLOGICAL ONTOLOGICAL NOTION THAN METAPHYSICS BECAUSE IF IT IS A MORE SO METAPHYSICAL NOTION THAN I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE SO MUCH OPINION INVOLVED AROUND MAKING SENSE OF WHY THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW AND GOVERNMENT AND EVEN IF GOVERNMENT IS A METAPHYSICAL NOTION OR BIOLOGICALLY INNATE IT OBVIOUSLY ISN'T TREATED THAT WAY MUCH OF OUR PERSONAL ONTOLOGIES GET IN THE WAY OF HOW WE WOULD LIKE THE GOVERNMENT TO BE SUCH AS A DIRECT DEMOCRACY WHICH BELIEVES EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS A VOICE WHILE CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY BELIEVES THAT ONE CAN BE THE KING AND THAT THERE ULTIMATELY IS THE LAW INTUITIVELY IT SOUNDS EASY TO DISMISS THIS QUESTION AND SAY OBVIOUSLY EPISTEMOLOGY THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT METAPHYSICALLY REAL AND A PRODUCT OF OUR FREE WILL AND IF IT WAS METAPHYSICS IT WOULD NOT NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED THE GOVERNMENT WOULD ALREADY BE BUT I ARGUE THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE TREATED AS AN ORGANIC PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S ORIGINS ARE INNATE IN OTHER WORDS I THINK IT'S COMPLETELY NATURAL THAT WE'RE FORMULATING GOVERNMENT
PROFESSOR
I AM A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR MYSELF AND I OFTEN HAVE TROUBLE READING SOME OF THE TEXTS THAT ARE OUTSIDE MY MAIN INTERESTS I EAST EPISTEMOLOGY DO YOU HAVE ANY TIPS ON TAKING NOTES WHILE READING OR ANNOTATING THE READING MATERIAL OR BOTH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
THANKS FOR DOING THIS

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE VITAL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE LIKE WILLIAM JAMES TALKS ABOUT
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE APPARENT CONTRADICTION IN TERMS OF CONSCIOUSNESS WITHIN A ORGANIC LINEIFORM IT SEEMS ODD THAT NATURE WOULD GIVE ORGANISM A TOOL SUCH AS WILLPOWER AND CONSCIOUS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DIRECTLY DISREGARD THEIR INSTINCTUAL PROGRAMMING TO REPRODUCE EAT ETC ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT AS WE UNDERSTAND IT THE PURPOSE OF LIFE IS TO SURVIVE ARE REPRODUCE DOES THIS MEAN THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS AN ACCIDENT OF NATURE MAKING OUR EXISTENCE AN ANOMALY OR IS SOMETHING THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE THE REALM OF NATURE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT AND IS SIMPLY APPLIED TO THE HUMAN RACE
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON OBJECTIVE VS SUBJECTIVE MORALITY DO YOU FEEL RELIGION OR SOME SUCH INSTITUTION IS CRUCIAL TO PROVING ONE OR THE OTHER
DOES GOD WONDER WHERE IT CAME FROM DOES IT GET LONELY DOES THE LARGE SCALE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE RESEMBLING A NEURAL NETWORK STRIKE AWE INTO THE DEBTS OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS
HI CASPAR WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE UNIVERSE BEING PREDETERMINED

IS THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE ON THE QUANTUM LEVEL ENOUGH TO PROVE THE UNIVERSE IS NOT COMPLETELY DETERMINED
IN A WORLD WHERE THERE IS AN EVER-INCREASING EMPHASIS ON STEM FIELDS NOT TO MENTION MIT BEING ONE OF THE PREMIER STEM INSTITUTIONS DO YOU FEEL INCREASINGLY MARGINALIZED FOR FOCUSING ON THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE IN GENERAL
WHAT DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE HAPPENS WHEN WE DIE AFTERLIFE OR NOT
WHAT IS YOUR CONCEPT OF GOD
WHY IS THE FOCUS WHERE WE GO WHEN WE DIE INSTEAD OF WHERE WE COME FROM WHEN WE ARE CREATED PS I THINK WE RETURN FROM WHERE WE COME JUST SAYING
HELLO PROFESSOR HARE

DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIBERTARIAN FREE WILL
HELLO CASPAR

IF GOD IS OMNIPOTENT AND ALL KNOWING WHY WOULD HE MAKE ANOTHER BEING SUCH AS THE DEVIL WHO COULD RISE UP TO EQUAL HIS POWER TO CAPTURE THE MIST PRECIOUS GIFT OF A HUMAN SOUL WHEN IT IS KNOWN TO BE GOD'S GREATEST CREATION

WOULDNT HE HAVE SEEN BETRAYAL WHY WOULDN'T THE OTHER ARCHANGELS JUST RISE UP TO DESTROY LUCIFER
IN YOUR OPINION IS A HOT DOG A SANDWICH
DO YOU THINK DRUNVALO MELCHIZEDEK IS LEGIT
CAN YOU ASK ANDREW GRAHAM WHY HE DOESN'T RESPOND TO EMAILS
HELLO PROFESSOR
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AMA
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE OMNIPOTENCE PARADOX DOES IT NEGATE THE PLAUSIBILITY OF THERE BEING A GOD
WHAT JOBS CAN A STUDENT GET WITH A PHILOSOPHY DEGREE HOW USEFUL IS IT
OPINION ON THE NON AGGRESSION PRINCIPLE AND VOLUNTARYISM
HOW HAS SOCIAL BEHAVIOR SHAPED THE WAY WE LOOK AT SOCIETY TODAY
DO YOU FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROJECT YOUR OWN OPINION INTO YOUR TEACHINGS OR CAN THAT BE DANGEROUS BEING A PERSON OF INFLUENCE
HOW DO I GET INTO MIT
IS PHILOSOPHY A MAJOR FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW YOU'RE WRONG WHILE NOT HAVING THE ANSWER
HELLO CASPAR

DOES GOD EXIST BECAUSE I THINK HE DOESN'T
HOW DO I ASK A QUESTION
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON FREEWILL VS DETERMINISM
RELIGION IS A MERE POLITICAL TOOL INVENTED BY POLITICIAN TO CONTROL THE POPULATION AND CONVINCE COMMONERS THAT THEY HAVE THE DIVINE RIGHT TO RULE US ALL THE DIVINE RIGHT TO RULE IS COMMON IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE ANCIENT ROME ANCIENT CHINA ANCIENT EGYPT ANCIENT INDIA ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA CULTURES SURELY THIS COMMONALITY BETWEEN CULTURES THAT HAD NO LIMITED CONTACT MEANS SOMETHING

DISCUSSION
HI CASPAR

I RECENTLY DISCOVERED I HAVE A PASSION FOR CONTEMPLATING THE MEANING OF LIFE EXISTENCE AND ALL THINGS FAR BEYOND OUR UNDERSTANDING THIS HAS BROUGHT ME TO THE CONCLUSION TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR A MAJOR IN PHILOSOPHY WOULD YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT I SHOULD PREPARE FOR
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE ETHICS OF EATING LIVING THINGS IS IT OK FROM A MORAL STANDPOINT TO EAT ANYTHING YOU CAN KILL ANYTHING OF A PARTICULAR INTELLIGENCE LEVEL ANYTHING THAT MOVES IS IT OK TO EAT A VIRUS

THANKS
HELLO CASPAR

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE CURRENT CHRISTIAN GOD IN COMPARISON TO THE ROMAN GREEK GODS OF THE PAST WHAT I AM GETTING AT IS THAT WE READILY DISPELL THESE AS MYTH BUT IS CURRENT RELIGION NOT JUST HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF SURE THIS GOD IS KIND WHERE THE OLD ONES WAGED WAR BUT SURELY THE OVERLYING SIMILARITIES CANNOT BE DISMISSED
I AM ASTONISHED THAT MIT HAS NOT MOVED ON BEYOND GOD SINCE I WAS THERE CLASS OF COURSE XVIII
WHY IS THERE SOMETHING INSTEAD OF NOTHING
HI PROF HARE THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS AMA I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHICH CURRENT THEORY OF CONSCIOUSNESS DO YOU BELIEVE IS MOST CORRECT GIVEN OUR CURRENT KNOWLEDGE
SETH SPEAKS IS SPIRITUAL METAPHYSICAL BUT I BELIEVE RELEVANT EVEN IF JUST TO STIMULATE THE MIND AND IMAGINATION I DON'T KNOW ABOUT WESTERN PHILOSOPHY BEING ROOTED IN PSYCHEDELICS BUT I THINK IT'S TERRENCE MCKENNA WHO POSTULATES OUR EVOLUTIONARY ANCESTORS IN AFRICA ATE A LOT OF MUSHROOMS AND THAT'S HOW THE CORTEX DEVELOPED TO BE ABLE TO CONCEPTUALIZE ABSTRACT THOUGHTS HAVE IMAGINATION ETC I THINK HE WROTE FOOD OF THE GODS

I THINK AN MIT PROFESSOR WOULD SUPPORT MIND ALTERING DRUG RESEARCH

CHECK OUT BELLEVUE NYU TERMINALLY ILL CANCER PATIENTS BEING TX WITH PSILOCYBIN

UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT MED SCHOOL HAS TONS OF MARIJUANA RESEARCH

I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO WHY AM I ALWAYS ON REDDIN
I'M NOT RELIGIOUS EITHER BUT DEFINITELY ACKNOWLEDGE SPIRITUALITY I THINK THAT IT IS THE CREATION THAT IS THE AWE MOMENT
IF HYPOTHETICALLY IN THE FUTURE WE WERE TO CREATE A UNIVERSE EITHER IN A LAB OR VIA A COMPUTER SIMULATION THAT EVOLVED LIFE WHICH IN TIME DEVELOPS CONSCIOUSNESS MUCH LIKE OUR OWN TO WHICH ONE CREATURE PONDERS WHERE DID THIS ALL COME FROM WOULD THAT NOT BE A CONSIDERABLE HINT THAT PERHAPS WE TOO WERE CREATED
WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO LIFE THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING
THOUGHTS ON ŹIŹEK AND HIS THOUGHTS ON CAPITALISTS DEATH
HAVE YOU MET ANY JANITORS AT MIT THAT REMIND YOU OF GOOD WILL HUNTING
HAVE YOU MET ANY JANITORS AT MIT THAT REMIND YOU OF GOOD WILL HUNTING
WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO WAKE UP AS A GHOST I CAN IMAGINE THE INITIAL SHOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMING OH WAIT I JUST READ THE REST OF THE TITLE SORRY SORRY CARRY ON
HI CASPAR I THINK PEOPLE ARE INPATIENT AND WOULD LIKE TO READ IN ONE PAGE THE SCIENTIFIC VIEW OF GRAND THEMES WOULD YOU AGREE I HAVE MADE TWO SUCH YOU CAN FIND THEM AT MY SITE
THE FIRST ONE IS ABOUT HOW LIFE CAME INTO EXISTENCE ON EARTH THE SECOND ABOUT HOW CONSCIOUSNESS CAME INTO EXISTENCE MAY I EMAIL YOU THE TWO
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF NICK BOSTROM AND OTHER PHILOSOPHERS WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE GREAT FILTER
HI PROFESSOR HARE

IS CONSCIOUSNESS AN EVOLUTIONARY TRAIT IF WE AS HUMANS FIGURE OUT A WAY TO LIVE FOR ETERNITY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS
HERE'S A QUESTION FROM U NOTSUNQ POSTED ON THE AMA ANNOUNCEMENT POST

THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA DR HARE FROM WHAT I'VE READ HERE YOU BELIEVE THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE WE WORK FROM SHOULD BE ONE RELATIVELY UNCONTESTED AND HUMBLE BUT IS THIS ONLY BECAUSE YOU VALUE HUMBLENESS WHY SHOULD I FOLLOW THIS PRINCIPLE ANYMORE THAN THE PRINCIPLE OF ARROGANCE A PRINCIPLE WHICH I VALUE
PROFESSOR HARE

THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DO THIS I WONDER IF THERE ARE ANY CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHERS IN THE FIELD OF ETHICS OR METAETHICS THAT YOU THINK ARE OVERLOOKED OR THAT ARE WORTH AN EXTRA LOOK INTO
HI PROF I ALWAYS GIVE QUESTIONS LIKE THESE TO PHILOSOPHERS SO
YOU BELIEVE IN GOD AND IF SO WHY DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD BE DESPAIR IN THIS WORLD
ISN'T IT KNOWLEDGE WISDOM ETC ACQUIRED BY CHANCE WHAT IF YOU WERE BORN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD ONE WHERE OPPORTUNITY RARELY COMES DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE THE SAME PERSON AS YOU ARE TODAY
AND DO YOU MAKE LIFE DECISIONS WHILE IN A SHOWER

THANKS COOL DUDE
AFTERNOON I PREFER LIGHT HEARTED QUESTIONS SO HERE WE GO WHAT NAIVE POSITION DO YOU FIND MOST ANNOYING IS IT NAIVE MORAL RELATIVISM CONSTANTLY BRINGING UP STRAW MEN THE LOVE OF EXPERTS BUT NOT WHEN IT'S AN APPEAL TO AUTHORITY
HI PROFESSOR

HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT COMPARING THE STATE OF MIND AFTER DEATH TO FALLING ASLEEP AND HAVING NO SLEEP

STATE OF HAVING NO THOUGHTS MEMORIES OF YOUR SLEEP NO CONCEPT OF TIME NO CONSCIOUSNESS AND JUST NOTHING
WHAT IS MODERN THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER ESSENTIAL FOR YOUR BOOKSHELF SOMETHING YOU'RE QUICK TO RECOMMEND
YOUR COURSE DESCRIPTION INCLUDES ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST THE EXISTENCE OF GOD

OF COURSE MANY FOLKS WANT TO JUST DIVE RIGHT INTO EXISTENTIALIST MATTERS BUT I WONDER IF THE TOPIC ISN'T BETTER SUITED TO AN INTERMEDIATE COURSE RATHER THAN THE FIRST HALF OF THE INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY
HELLO PROF HARE

MY QUESTION IS IS THERE A FUNCTIONAL ETHICAL SYSTEM INSIDE OF DETERMINISTIC PRINCIPLES OR IS KANT RIGHT ON THE PROPOSITION THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE FOR A PREMISE THAT FREEDOM OF WILL EXISTS SO THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT ETHICS I AM MOSTLY INTERESTED IN NATURALIST MISTAKE THAT YOU CAN'T DERIVE MUST BE DONE FROM WHAT IS AND CAN IT BE AVOIDED CAN YOU SUGGEST ANY TEXT ON HOW THIS CAN BE DONE I CAN SEE A SIMILAR QUESTION WAS ASKED IN THE COMMENTS SECTION BUT IT WASN'T IN THIS FORM I THINK MY QUESTION IS A BIT MORE PRECISE ON THIS MATTER
HI CASPAR

I ENJOYED YOUR PAPER ABOUT OUR OBLIGATIONS TO MERELY STATISTICAL PEOPLE

ONE WORRY I HAD WAS THAT YOUR ARGUMENT FOR OUR ADMITTEDLY MARGINALLY SO BUT NONETHELESS GREATER OBLIGATION TO IDENTIFIED PEOPLE RESTS ON THE DISTRIBUTE BAD EFFECTS PRINCIPAL THIS PRINCIPLE SAYS THAT ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL IT S BETTER FOR MANY PEOPLE TO SUFFER MINOR HARMS THAN FOR ONE PERSON TO SUFFER A MAJOR HARM SO ON YOUR VIEW IT S BETTER TO DISTRIBUTE THE CHANCE OF DYING AMONG FOUR DIFFERENT PEOPLE SUCH THAT EACH PERSON HAS A PROBABILITY OF DYING RATHER THAN CONDEMN ONE PERSON TO DIE WITH A PROBABILITY OF MY WORRY IS THAT THIS PRINCIPLE IS ONLY TRUE WITH RESPECT TO ACTUAL REALIZED BAD EFFECTS IT DOES NOT SEEM TRUE WITH RESPECT TO PROBABILITIES OF POTENTIAL BUT ULTIMATELY UNREALIZED BAD EFFECTS FOR EXAMPLE CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE PERSON BEING SCOLDED WITH A GALLON OF BOILING WATER AND A MILLION PEOPLE BEING SCOLDED WITH ONE OF A GALLON OF BOILING WATER THE LATTER SEEMS PREFERABLE DISTRIBUTING THE BAD EFFECT SCOLDING WITH A GALLON OF BOILING WATER ACROSS A MILLION DIFFERENT PEOPLE SEEMS BETTER THAN CONSOLIDATING IT ON A SINGLE PERSON HOWEVER CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SINGLE PERSON BEING SCOLDED WITH A GALLON OF BOILING WATER AND TWO PEOPLE EACH HAVING A PROBABILITY OF BEING SCOLDED WITH A GALLON A BOILING WATER WHERE ONE AND ONLY ONE OF THE TWO PEOPLE WILL DEFINITELY BE SCOLDED THERE DOESN T SEEM TO BE A NORMATIVE DIFFERENCE BOTH SEEM EQUALLY BAD WHY WELL DISTRIBUTING THE PROBABILITY OF THE BAD EFFECT ACROSS TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE DOESN T ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTE THE BAD EFFECT ITSELF ULTIMATELY THE ENTIRE BAD EFFECT IS CONSOLIDATED ON THE PERSON WHO ENDS UP BEING SCOLDED COUNTERFACTUAL PROBABILITIES OPEN OR CLOSED ABOUT WHETHER THE ULTIMATELY SCOLDED PERSON MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SCOLDED SEEMS NORMATIVELY IRRELEVANT ASSUMING THAT IN EACH CASE ONE AND ONLY ONE PERSON IS ULTIMATELY SCOLDED WITH A GALLON OF WATER

YOU ALMOST SEEM TO SUGGEST THIS LINE OF THOUGHT YOURSELF AT ONE POINT IN YOUR PAPER IN YOUR CRITICISM OF NORMAN DANIELS YOU ASK WHY ISN T LIVING THE RELEVANT GOOD HERE NOT CHANCES OF LIVING ALSO AT THE END OF THE PAPER YOU FINALLY CONCEDE THAT OUR GREATER OBLIGATION TO IDENTIFIED PEOPLE ISN T PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE A BENEVOLENT RATIONAL PERSON CARES ABOUT PEOPLE NOT ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH HER ACTIONS AFFECT PEOPLE ONE WAY OF READING THIS IS THAT TINKERING WITH THE PROBABILITIES OF WHO EXACTLY WILL EXPERIENCE THE SAME BAD EFFECT IS NORMATIVELY IRRELEVANT WHEN ULTIMATELY THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE THE SAME BAD EFFECT

MY WORRY MIGHT SUGGEST THAT YOUR NOTION OF THE COUNTERFACTUALLY OPEN PROCESS IS NOT REALLY AS RELEVANT TO ANSWERING THE QUESTION ABOUT OUR OBLIGATIONS TO STATISTICAL VS IDENTIFIED PEOPLE AS MUCH AS A NOTION OF NORMATIVE TRANSITIVITY OR SOME NOTION ABOUT HOW BAD EFFECTS CAN BE DIVIDED AMONG PEOPLE OF COURSE I IMAGINE THAT YOU DISAGREE AND WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS
HELLO PROFESSOR HARE I AM CURRENTLY A FRESHMEN IN COLLEGE WHO REALLY BECAME FASCINATED WITH PHILOSOPHY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS I'D LOVE TO HAVE A CAREER IN IT AND END UP IN A POSITION SIMILAR TO YOURSELF HOWEVER I IMAGINE MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIELD IS NAIVE SO WHAT ARE THE REALITIES OF THIS JOB CAREER FIELD WOULD YOU ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO PURSUE IT OR PUSH THEM TO GET A DEGREE IN SOMETHING ELSE THANKS
THANKS FOR DOING THIS AMA DR HARE

AS SOMEONE DOING PHILOSOPHY AT MIT TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THERE IS A ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED GULF BETWEEN PHILOSOPHERS AND SCIENTISTS WITH RESPECT TO TRUTH CLAIMS METHODOLOGY WITHIN OVERLAPPING SUBJECT MATTER OF PHYSICS OR OTHER FIELDS WOULD YOU SAY THE GULF IS CHANGING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON DAVID CHALMERS ALSO IF CHALMERS AND DENNETT WERE IN A CAGE MATCH WHO WOULD WIN
DELETED
IS GOD REAL AND ARE YOU CHRISTIAN

WHAT MAKES LIFE A FIGHT WHAT DOES NOT

I HAD AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION IN A GROUP COUNSELING THE COUNSELOR WAS MAKING THE POINT OF HOW LIFE ISN'T A FIGHT AT ALL TO BATTLE IS TO FIGHT YOURSELF I THEN MADE A POINT ABOUT HOW I THINK LIFE IS A FIGHT WE FIGHT TO SURVIVE TO FIND PERSPECTIVE AND TO LEARN

THIS WAS A FEW YEARS AGO MY MOTIVATION TO SAY IT WAS LITERALLY TO FIGHT THE CONCEPT AND PLAY DEVILS ADVOCATE CREATING PURPOSE IN FIGHTING FOR THE ARGUMENT OF NOT FIGHTING

WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS

SO THIS IS NOT A LEGITIMATE QUESTION HUH
HI PROFESSOR HARE

I'VE READ YOUR DISSERTATION AND I LOVED THE CLARITY OF YOUR WRITING AND THE PRECISION OF YOUR THOUGHT HOWEVER I HAVE A HARD TIME REMEMBERING YOUR ARGUMENTS I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT MOST OF THE ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY I'VE READ INCLUDING THE WORKS I'VE MOST ENJOYED FOR SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF THE ACADEMY DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO REMEMBER PHILOSOPHY OR AT LEAST TO GET THE MOST OUT OF READING IT

THANKS
DELETED
SOOOOOOO AFTER EVERYTHING YOU HAVE LEARNED IN YOUR OPINION DOES GOD EXIST
HELLO PROFESSOR
I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON DETERMINISM AND HOW IT AFFECTS PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS PUT FORWARD BY EARLY PHILOSOPHERS
ALSO IN YOUR OPINION HOW DOES DETERMINISM AFFECT ETHICS
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT AMA

EDIT ADDED A QUESTION
HI PROFESSOR

WHO DO YOU PERSONALLY FEEL ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT OR AT LEAST MOST INTERESTING CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHER S
HELLO LATELY I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN MATHEMATICAL LOGICAL PATTERNS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS LAYERS IN NATURE HIGH LEVEL LOW LEVEL AND SO ON ENGLISH IS NOT MY NATIVE TONGUE DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW ANY BOOKS OR OTHER MEDIA REGARDING THIS SUBJECT RATHER NOT WITH A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE BUT A PHILOSOPHICAL ONE
GOOD AFTERNOON PROFESSOR
WHEN IT COMES TO DREAMS AND MODERN PHILOSOPHY DO YOU SIDE MORE WITH DESCARTES OR KANT
DESCARTES CLAIMS ONE CANNOT TELL WHEN THEY'RE DREAMING AND OUR BRAIN IS LIKE A PAINTER PAINTING A PICTURE OR ANTS THEORY OF DREAMS WHERE BITS AND PIECES OF EXPERIENCES ARE GLUED TOGETHER TO MAKE UP THE DREAM DO LUCID DREAMS VOID WHAT DESCARTES SAYS
PROFESSOR HARE

PEOPLE SAY AND LIKE YOU SAID ALSO TO ONE OF THE OTHER POSTS HERE PHILOSOPHY HAS BEEN THE ROOT AND THE STARTING POINT OF A LOT OF OTHER ACADEMICS LIKE MATH PHYSICS AND WHAT NOT I DO AGREE WITH THIS BUT I THINK IT IS BECAUSE BACK THEN NOTHING HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BUT THESE DAYS EVERYTHING HAS BRANCHED OUT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIFIC AREA DO YOU THINK PHILOSOPHY WILL GIVE RISE TO ANYTHING NEW I HONESTLY CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A NEW GROUNDBREAKING WORK THAT WILL BRING ENORMOUS IMPACT IN CENTURY BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST ME I WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON MY DOUBTS
GOOD AFTERNOON PROFESSOR HARE THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AMA

TWO SMALL QUESTIONS THE FIRST WOULD BE CONCERNING THE MDOC HAVE YOU NOTICED ANY STUDENTS COMING INTO THE COURSE WITH SOMEWHAT ENTRENCHED MISINFORMATION I ASK BECAUSE I'VE NOTICED IT AT THE UNIVERSITY I ATTEND AND I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THAT WOULD BE REMOVED IN COURSES THAT ARE MORE FOCUSED ON BEING INTERESTED AND ENGAGING WITH THE COURSE DUE TO PERSONAL MOTIVATION

SECONDLY HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO SOMEONE WHO ASKS WHY WE SHOULD BE RATIONAL I READ SHELLY PAPER KANTIANISM FOR CONSEQUENTIALISTS AND I APPRECIATE HIS POINTING OUT THAT RATIONALITY REASON STANDS AUTONOMOUSLY AND JUST IS THE STANDARD WE USE TO JUDGE THINGS BUT I DO THINK THERE MIGHT BE MORE TO THE STORY HERE
COMPARE PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION FOR US DO YOU CONSIDER RELIGION A PHILOSOPHY AND OR VISE VERSA
ARE WE IN THE MATRIX

ARE WE LIVING IN A SIMULATION
WHAT IS LIFE

PAGE SOUTH FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART I'D VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE
I LIVE IN BOSTON CAN I COME HANG OUT AT THE MIT PHILOSOPHY COLLOQUIA
PROF

WHY DOSE GOD EXIST


WHY DID I GET DIFFERED FROM MIT
HI I'VE SEEN THAT THERE IS A THEIST ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT IF OUR COUNCIOUSSNES CAN BE PROJECTED TOWARDS ANY OBJECT THEN GOD EXISTS WHY DO THEY SAY THAT CAN'T WE HAVE THIS THINKING ABILITY WITHOUT GOD
SAY HI TO MR SLOCUM FOR ME LZ WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HIS SON AND A FEW SCUBA DIVING TRIPS
HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE GOD
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

READ THE POST BEFORE YOU REPLY

READ THE POSTED CONTENT UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS GIVEN AND RESPOND TO THESE SUBSTANTIVELY IF YOU HAVE UNRELATED THOUGHTS OR DON'T WISH TO READ THE CONTENT PLEASE POST YOUR OWN THREAD OR SIMPLY REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING COMMENTS WHICH ARE CLEARLY NOT IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE POSTED CONTENT MAY BE REMOVED

THIS SUB IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TANGENTIAL ANECDOTES OR DANK MEMES EXPECT COMMENT THREADS THAT BREAK OUR RULES TO BE REMOVED
IT IS SORT LIKE THE ARGUMENT GOING LIKE WHY HELP POOR PEOPLE ABROAD WHILE WE HAVE OUR POOR PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY PEOPLE WHO ASK THIS TYPICALLY HELP NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
SO GOOD THAT YOU DO GOOD AND THANKS
AND IN THE END MAN IS AN ANIMAL TOO
REMOVED
WELL TECHNICALLY WOULDN'T A WILD ANIMAL THAT'S DEFENDING ITS TERRITORY BY ANY MEANS BE CONSIDERED A SOVEREIGN IN ESSENCE USING ITS RIGHT THROUGH UNIVERSAL LAW OF RIGHT TO LIVE PROTECT ETC BEING THE FACT THAT IN THIS CURRENT SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T EVEN PUSH THE ISSUE OF PROTECTING HUMANS SOVEREIGN RIGHTS TO ACTUALLY MAKING US DOMESTICATED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PRODUCTION ETC TO FEED THE MASSIVE APPETITE OF THE SUPER RICHARD HUMAN RIGHTS VS ANIMAL RIGHTS ARE NO DIFFERENT UNTIL THAT SOVEREIGN RIGHT GETS INFRINGED UPON
REMOVED
IT'S BECAUSE SOME QUESTIONS ARE TOO DIFFICULT TO BE ANSWERED BY TECHNOLOGY ALONE TECHNOLOGY WILL PROBABLY NEVER FIX SOME OF FUNDAMENTAL FACETS OF HUMAN NATURE
YEAH BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T HELP YOU ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE OR WHAT IS MORAL AND WHAT IS NOT WHAT WE DO HAS CHANGED BUT WHO WE ARE HAS NOT AND WHO WE ARE IS NOT CAPABLE OF ANSWERING SUCH QUESTIONS ON OUR OWN
PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY DON T CARE ABOUT METAPHYSICS REALLY MEAN THAT THEIR RECEIVED IDEAS ON SUCH MATTERS ARE SO FIXED THAT THEY HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU DON T USUALLY NOTICE YOUR HEARTBEAT PHILOSOPHERS ARE PEOPLE WHO FOR SOME REASON PLATO CALLED IT THE SENSE OF WONDER FEEL COMPELLED TO MAKE THE OBVIOUS STRANGE WHEN THEY TRY TO COMMUNICATE THAT BASIC PERVASIVE STRANGENESS OR WONDER TO OTHER PEOPLE THEY USUALLY FIND THAT THE OTHER PEOPLE DON T LIKE IT SOMETIMES AS WITH SOCRATES THEY LIKE IT SO LITTLE THAT THEY PUT THE PHILOSOPHER TO DEATH MORE OFTEN HOWEVER THEY JUST IGNORE HIM

RIGHT IN THE FEELS
WE STRUGGLE BECAUSE SO FEW ARE CONCERNED WITH ENLIGHTENMENT IF YOU LOOK DEEPLY IN YOURSELF YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A RIGHT WAY TO DO MOST THINGS AND DEFINITELY A RIGHT WAY TO TREAT EVERYONE THE PROBLEM IS THAT SO FEW LACK THE STRENGTH OF WILL TO PROMOTE PROGRESS WHILE THOSE IN CHARGE LACK THE SELF CONTROL TO KEEP THEIR TOXIC LOGIC TO THEMSELVES
THE ANSWER IS PRESENT IN YOUR QUESTION TECHNOLOGY EITHER WORKS OR DOESN'T PHILOSOPHY IS EITHER PERSUASIVE TO A SMALL SUBSET OF THE POPULATION OR NOT PERSUASIVE TO A SMALL SUBSET OF THE POPULATION ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER AS SOON AS A BIT OF PHILOSOPHY BECOMES DEFINITIVE PRESTO IT'S SUDDENLY NOT EXACTLY PHILOSOPHY ANYMORE BUT JOINS THE RANKS OF THE LIKES OF LOGIC OR SCIENCE
AS LONG AS WE HAVE LANGUAGE WE WILL CONTINUE TO FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE INTERESTING PROBLEMS IT CREATES
HOW SHOULD THESE TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS HELP ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IF ANYTHING THEY'VE CREATED MORE LIKE THE ETHICS OF CLONING FOR EXAMPLE

THIS WAS A NUANCED COMMON SENSE CONVERSATION SOMETHING I ALWAYS APPRECIATE ABOUT SAM HE ALWAYS MAKES THESE PHILOSOPHICAL EXAMPLES BECOME ACTUAL IN A WAY THAT SHAKES THEM DOWN REMOVING THE DEAD WOOD

THE CASE ABOUT LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE YOUR DOCTOR COULD HARVEST YOUR ORGANS FOR THE GREATER GOOD SHOWS HOW INSUFFICIENT PURE UTILITARIANISM REALLY IS
THE CONVERSATION ABOUT PARFAIT AT THE END LINKING REASONS AND PERSONS TO DEVELOPING WORK ON POPULATION ETHICS BEING CONDUCTED AT OXFORD WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING

THE CLOSING SEGMENT WHERE HARRIS STATES THAT HE WILL BE DONATING THE FIRST RAISED BY EACH PODCAST TO CHARITY THE FIGURE IS ESTIMATE AS TO WHAT IS REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY SAVE A LIFE IS PARTICULARLY POWERFUL AND DEMONSTRATES HOW PHILOSOPHY CAN SOMETIMES TRANSLATE INTO GOOD
FOR MORE ON THIS TOPIC YOU ARE ALL WELCOME TO JOIN THE CONVERSATION AT R EFFECTIVEALTRUISM
HE IS SCRATCHING AT AN ISSUE THAT HAS GAINED MORE AND MORE SUPPORTERS IN THE LAST YEARS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE SO CALLED PUBLISH OR PERISH STATE OF MODERN ACADEMIA PEOPLE PUBLISH BOOKS AND PAPERS NOT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TO GET A POSITION TODAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE PUBLISHED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PAPERS AND BOOKS AND THE CONTENT IS SECONDARY THOUSANDS OF PAPERS ARE PUBLISHED EVERY YEAR THAT NOBODY WILL EVER READ
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS THREAD HAS BEEN VERY ENCOURAGING FOR ME DESPITE THE TOTALLY LEGITIMATE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING BROUGHT UP ABOUT ACADEMIA IT WARMS MY CYNICAL PHD PURSUING HEART TO SEE PHILOSOPHERS AND SCIENTISTS DISCUSSING SOME COMMON ISSUES WITHOUT FALLING INTO THE VERY FRUSTRATING DIVISIVE DISCOURSES THAT SEEM TO DOMINATE DISCUSSIONS AS OF LATE
WHEN I WENT THROUGH MY PHILOSOPHY PROGRAMS UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE I FOUND IT VERY UNLIKELY TO ENCOUNTER A PHILOSOPHER WHO DIDN'T FIT INTO ONE OF SEVERAL CATEGORIES

PHILOSOPHERS WHO COUPLED THEIR INQUIRIES WITH A SCIENCE I EAST PHILOSOPHERS INTERESTED IN COGNITION WHO ALSO RESEARCHED STUDIED NEUROSCIENCE AND COGNITIVE SCIENCE
PHILOSOPHER OF A SCIENCE I EAST PHILOSOPHER OF BIOLOGY OR PHYSICS
ETHICISTS WHETHER IN GENERAL BUT MORE LIKELY A SPECIFIC FIELDS EITHER BIOETHICS ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS ETC
PHILOSOPHERS OF A CERTAIN ERA PERIOD WHO ALSO DELVED DEEPLY INTO THE HISTORY OF THE PERIOD ALONG WITH THE HISTORIOGRAPHY OF THE WORKS IN THAT PERIOD

IF DENNETT WANTS TO USE METAPHYSICS AS AN EXAMPLE THAT'S GREAT BUT MOST PHILOSOPHERS I ENCOUNTERED WERE ONLY COINCIDENTALLY INTERESTED IN THOSE TOPICS BECAUSE THEY HAD TO TEACH UNDERGRADUATE COURSES IN THEM IN MORE CASES THAN NOT THE QUESTIONS WE STUDIED AND RAISED WERE STILL VERY APPLICABLE TO A WIDE VARIETY OF FIELDS SCIENCES INCLUDED I DON'T DOUBT THAT THERE IS A PUBLISH OR ELSE MINDSET IN ACADEMIA I EXPERIENCED IT I THINK THE MOVE FROM PHILOSOPHERS TOWARD MORE INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK MIGHT BE A REACTION TO THIS IF YOUR FIELD PHILOSOPHY IS SO WIDE-RANGING IT'S DIFFICULT TO ENCAPSULATE IT IN MY VIEW IS NOT PRODUCING WORTHWHILE MATERIAL FOR DISCOURSE THEN YOU'RE LEFT TO GO ELSEWHERE FOR NEW MATERIAL AND THAT'S USUALLY FOSTERED AROUND OTHER DISCIPLINES WHICH IS FINE

PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A GREAT UNIFYING STUDY OFTEN TIMES IT ANSWERS QUESTIONS OTHER DISCIPLINES DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE THE ANSWERS WOULD LACK THE RIGOR NECESSARY FOR HARD SCIENCES OR EVEN SCIENCE IN GENERAL I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A FIGHT OVER HARD V SOFT SCIENCE IN MY EXPERIENCE WHAT SCIENCES PRODUCE THESE DAYS ARE A WHOLE HOST OF MATHEMATICS OR DATA AND PHILOSOPHERS TEND TO BE THE ONES BRAVE ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT TO INTERPRET IT AND PLACE IT INTO A COMPLETE PICTURE
I ALWAYS HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT PHILOSOPHERS HAVE HAD THIS REPUTATION FOR A LONG WHILE
AREN'T WE ALL JUST TRYING TO JUSTIFY OUR OWN ACTIONS THOUGH
AS A COMPLETE LAYMAN ON THE OCCASIONS THAT I'VE READ OVER AND CONTEMPLATED SOMETHING NEW IN PHILOSOPHY IT OFTEN SEEMS TO ME THAT THE AUTHOR IS CRAFTING AN ARGUMENT BASED AROUND SEMANTICAL EQUIVALENCES AND THEIR CONCLUSION IS SO UNINTUITIVE THAT IT PRACTICALLY APPEARS INTENTIONALLY SHOCKING AS IF THEIR INTENTION WAS TO TRY TO PROVE SOMETHING AS A DARE FOR PEOPLE TO REBUT IT OBJECTIVELY

I'D BE MORE INTERESTED IF IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE INTENTION WAS TO EXPRESS AN HONEST THOUGHT BASED ON SOUND LOGIC TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD BETTER NOT TO CONSTANTLY EXPLORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH ONE CAN MAKE UNFALSIFIABLE ARGUMENTS

I'M SURE THIS ALL SOUNDS VERY DUMB TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY EDUCATED ON THIS SUBJECT
REMOVED
THIS IS NOT A NEW ARGUMENT IN PHILOSOPHY BY ANY MEANS WITTGENSTEIN MADE THIS SAME ARGUMENT AS DID NIETZSCHE AND JOHN RAWLS ARISTOTLE EVEN CALLS PHILOSOPHY AN EXERCISE OF THE MIND

YOU MAKE SHITTY INVENTIONS AND IPHONE AND PEOPLE WILL MARVEL OVER THE ONE DOES THAT MEAN WE STOP INVENTING STUFF I DON'T THINK SO

HE ARGUES THAT PEOPLE ARE WRITING BASED ON QUESTIONS THAT DON'T NEED ANSWERING BUT THAT CAN BE SAID ABOUT HIS WHOLE FIELD
HERE'S A SECRET THE SAME APPLIES TO MATH PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY CAN'T SPEAK TO BIOLOGY

MUCH OF WHAT IS DONE IN EACH OF THESE FIELDS IS ENTIRELY OUT OF ACADEMIC INTEREST WITH NO NOTION OF APPLICATION OR NECESSITY IN MIND AT ALL

WE LIKE TO STUDY INTERESTING QUESTIONS IT'S OFTEN TIMES JUST A COINCIDENCE WHEN THEY'RE USEFUL
I THINK THE ARTICLE MISREPRESENTS WHAT DENNETT MEANS I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR EITHER THE ARTICLE OR I TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF DENNETT AS HE'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND COHERENTLY UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW ALL HIS POSITIONS AND EVEN THEN SOMETIMES HIS VIEWS DEVELOP AND CHANGE

HAVING SAID THAT THE ARTICLE PRAISES DENNETT FOR HIS VIEWS THAT
CONSCIOUSNESS REQUIRES NO MAGIC OTHER THAN THE PHYSICAL MECHANICS OF THE BRAIN THAT SIMILARLY COMPLEX ROBOTS WOULD BE EQUALLY CONSCIOUS AND THAT THE SELF OR EGO DOES NOT EXIST

THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY METAPHYSICAL VIEWS I THINK MOST WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO ARGUE THAT DENNETT DOESN'T SPECIALISE IN THE METAPHYSICS OF THE MIND

BUT THEN THE ARTICLE SAYS
MUCH IF NOT ALL PHILOSOPHICAL WORK IN ANALYTIC METAPHYSICS FOR EXAMPLE IS WILLFULLY CUT OFF FROM ANY SERIOUS ISSUES SAYS DENNETT

I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT THE PHRASE ANALYTIC METAPHYSICS AS THE TARGET OF DISDAIN ISN'T A DIRECT QUOTE BUT ONE THE AUTHOR OF THE ARTICLE HAS LINKED TO THE WILLFULLY CUT OFF QUOTE

I DON'T THINK DENNETT WAS WRITING THE OBITUARY OF ANALYTIC METAPHYSICS AT ALL WHICH IS WHAT THE ARTICLE MAKES OUT I THINK HIS GRIPE IS THE OPPOSITE THAT ANALYTIC METAPHYSICS IS ACTUALLY MEANINGFUL AND WORTHWHILE BUT THE PRESSURE ON GRADUATES TO BE PROVOCATIVE TO GET PUBLISHED ISN'T JUST UNHELPFUL BUT ACTIVELY SLOWING DOWN PROGRESS
I'M AMAZED THAT SO MUCH DISCUSSION IS TAKING PLACE OVER JUST WORDS AND ONLY TWO FULL SENTENCE QUOTES AND TWO PARTIAL SENTENCE QUOTES THERE WAS SO LITTLE IN THAT ARTICLE FOR A NEB TO ZERO IN ON OR IS EVERYONE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THIS GUY I POPPED IT TO READ THE COMMENTS BECAUSE THE ARTICLE SOUNDED LIKE A CLICKBAIT FORMULA GET SOMEONE FAMOUS TO POOH-POOH SOMETHING TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED IMPORTANT I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED TO AN OUTSIDER IT SOUNDS LIKE A KID'S TODAY SHAKES FIST ARGUMENT GOES BACK TO LOOKING AT R CATS
TOO BAD DENNETT DID NOT PROVIDE A TOP OR LIST OF RECENT ARTICLES AS EXAMPLES OF WORKS HE CONSIDERS TO BE SELF-INDULGENT OR OVERLY CUTESY BUT I SUPPOSE THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO MUCH REAL WORLD ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHY COMMUNITY
FULLY AGREE WITH DENNETT HERE THIS CHESS PROBLEM HAS REALLY GOTTEN OUT OF HAND SADLY WITH A MIX WITH THE PATHOLOGICAL PUBLISH OR PERISH CULTURE AND AN OBSCURANTIST MINDSET DRIVEN BY EGO AND ENTITLEMENT

THERE IS A WHOLE GENERATION OF ARGUMENTATION THAT SEEMS TO SOLELY OPERATE IN BAD FAITH AND UNCHARITABLY
MUCH IF NOT ALL PHILOSOPHICAL WORK IN ANALYTIC METAPHYSICS FOR EXAMPLE IS WILLFULLY CUT OFF FROM ANY SERIOUS ISSUES SAYS DENNETT

MAYBE BUT THIS IS PARTIALLY WHY THE EMERGING SUBDISCIPLINE OF METAMETAPHYSICS EXISTS SO THAT METAPHYSICIANS CAN MAKE ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE AS THE GOALS AIMS AND PROSPECTS OF METAPHYSICS


PERHAPS DENNETT HAS IN MIND A CRITIQUE OF METAPHYSICIANS A LA JAMES LADEMAN AND DON ROSS IN EVERYTHING MUST GO THAT ANALYTIC METAPHYSICIANS LARGELY RELY ON A BANKRUPT NOTION OF WHAT OUR BEST SCIENCE SAYS THE WORLD IS LIKE EVEN SO THIS IS ITSELF A PHILOSOPHICAL CLAIM THAT IS NOT WITHOUT CRITICISM
CLAIMS THE MIND IS SATISFACTORILY EXPLAINED BY REDUCING IT ENTIRELY TO DESCRIPTIONS OF OBJECTIVE PHYSICAL PROCESSES
CLAIMS SOME THINGS ARE INTRINSICALLY INTERESTING

DENNETT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A MAN WHO LEERS AT THE SUBJECTIVITY OF OTHERS BUT CLEVERLY DISGUISES HIS OWN AS OBJECTIVITY THROUGH RHETORIC HE'S MADE SOME WONDERFUL CONTRIBUTIONS BUT HE'S BLIND TO HIS OWN BIASES PERHAPS MORESO THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
ISN'T THIS THE SAME SORT OF THING AS PURE MATHEMATICS OR BASIC RESEARCH IN ANY FIELD OF SCIENCE THE SORT OF PUBLICATION HE'S DESCRIBING SEEMS LIKE A NECESSARY FEATURE OF ACADEMIA

THERE ARE LOTS OF GREAT ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH BUT DENNETT SEEMS TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME ACTIVITY IN PHILOSOPHY AS IF IT'S A BAD THING
NEW ATHEISM


TAKING HIM SERIOUSLY

I'M GOOD
SOME GOOD POINTS THROUGHOUT BUT OF COURSE HE PULLS THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE CARD THAT IS A TACKY ANALYTIC CLICHE AND THERE'S NO GOOD REASON WHY METAPHYSICS OUGHT TO REQUIRE AS MUCH EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE READ WHATEVER OUR SCIENCE OVERLORDS SAY IS RIGHT AS
REMOVED
SIMPLY READ WILLIAM JAMES LAST BOOK ON SOME PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED IT WAS THE LAST BOOK I READ AFTER GRADUATING WITH A DOUBLE DEGREE ONE HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY IT MADE ME THINK VERY HARD ABOUT CERTAIN WELL-ACCEPTED TENETS
I DON'T THINK SELF-INDULGENT WOULD BE THE WORD THAT I WOULD USE BECAUSE IN MANY CASES I THINK PEOPLE REALLY DO THINK THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING SOMETHING IMPORTANT BUT A LOT OF WHAT HE SAYS RINGS TRUE I'M GENERALLY A LOT MORE INTERESTED BY PHILOSOPHERS WITH AN EASY ANSWER TO WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS

SO YAY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS BOO FOR MUCH ANALYTIC AESTHETICS HORRAY FOR ETHICS YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE BOO PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE THAT YOU CAN'T OTHERWISE WHAT'S THE POINT
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE SEEN USEFUL PHILOSOPHY ANYWHERE I DISCUSS AND DEBATE IT BECAUSE IT'S INTERESTING SO YES IN GENERAL I THINK IT IS SELF INDULGENT AND I DO THINK PEOPLE ASKING FOR MORE TO BE SPENT ON PHILOSOPHY ARE BEING OTT EXCEPT MAYBE SOME IN SCHOOLS BECAUSE WHILE PHILOSOPHY ITSELF ISN'T MUCH USE CRITICAL THINKING IS AND YOU CAN'T LEARN PHILOSOPHY WITHOUT CRITICAL THINKING
INTRINSIC INTEREST IS A CATEGORY THAT MR DENNETT MIGHT HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME PINNING DOWN AND OR PROVING WHAT IS INTRINSICALLY INTERESTING YOU'D HAVE TO POSIT SOME SORT OF PLATONIC IDEAL OF INTERESTING EXISTING APART FROM THE SPHERE OF HUMAN THOUGHT RATHER THAN A CHANGING DISPOSITION OF THE PHILOSOPHER IN ORDER TO CALL SOMETHING INTRINSICALLY INTERESTING
THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST OF THE BEST HISTORICAL PHILOSOPHERS WERE ALSO SELF-INDULGENT HEGEL GOOD GOD IT'S A SELF-INDULGENT ENTERPRISE BY PRACTICE

WHEN YOU LOOK BACK IN TIME HOWEVER YOU ONLY SEE THE FEW MEMORABLE PHILOSOPHERS YOU DON'T SEE MOST OF THE MEDIOCRE GARBAGE WHICH HAS BEEN LOST TO MEMORY AND RECORD WHEN YOU LOOK AT CURRENT PHILOSOPHY YOU SEE TONS AND TONS OF PUBLISHED BS IT'S NOT WORSE OR MORE SELF-INDULGENT IT JUST HASN'T HAD EITHER THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAND THE TEST OF TIME AND SCRUTINY OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE FORGOTTEN
DELETED
I AORTA UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYING BUT I BELIEVE HE IS BEING TOO HARD ON PHILOSOPHY AS A WHOLE I DON'T KNOW MAYBE IT'S JUST MY OPINION BUT FIRST HE TALKS ABOUT FILOSOFE BEING OF A USE TO THE WORLD AS IF IT WAS SURE IT CAN INFLUENCE THE MIND AND CHANGE THE PERSPECTIVES OF HUMANS BUT ALL IN ALL IT'S TO THINK QUESTION AND BE CRITICAL OF ALL THINGS THEIR PURPOSE REASON AND OUTCOME I FEEL THAT ALL PHILOSOPHY IS GOOD ALMOST ALL AND IT IS GOOD FOR HUMANS TO BECOME MORE SELF AWARE MAYBE SOME PEOPLE HAVE WEAKER PHILOSOPHES BUT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO THINK AND BECOME CRITICAL IS ALREADY A START MAYBE I'M OVERTHINKING THIS I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE I WAS ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHAT I THOUGHT
IF ALL YOU SEE IS DARKNESS THEN BE THE LIGHT DIDN'T DENNETT WANT ATHEISTS TO BE CALLED BRIGHTS WHAT LIGHT DOES HE BRING I'VE NOT HEARD A WORD FROM HIM THAT SHED ANY LIGHT ON ANYTHING HIS SOLUTION TO THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM IS TO DO AN ILLUSION TRICK AND SAY I TRICKED YOU THEREFOR YOUR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE ISN'T REAL AND PEOPLE APPLAUD AND TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY IT'S UTTER NONSENSICAL REASONING
AGREED AND I GUESS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU COULD SAY THAT ABOUT THE MAJORITY OF ACADEMIC FIELDS WHAT'S THE POINT OF GENERATING NEW KNOWLEDGE IF IT'S LIMITED TO THE INSULAR WORLD OF ACADEMIA AND NOT BENEFITTING SOCIETY AT LARGE MAKING PHILOSOPHY MORE ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDER RANGE OF PEOPLE READ NOT WORDING AND AS THE ARTICLE STATES INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION WOULD IMO MAKE PHILOSOPHY A LOT MORE USEFUL AND NOT USEFUL AS IN SOLELY THROUGH A CAPITALIST LENS I EAST PROFITABLE
OME SO MUCH THIS THIS REMINDS ME OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH PAPERS

JUST LOOK AT THE SCIENCE RESEARCH DISCIPLINE AND THE TRAFFIC THEY ARE CREATING

NOT ONLY ARE THEY PUBLISHING WORK THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE WILL READ BUT ALSO THE MAJORITY OF THE PUBLISHED WORK IS ONLY BASED OFF NICHES SO MUCH SO TO A DEGREE THAT THE STUDENTS SOMEHOW CORELATED POINT A WITH POINT Z

HOW MANY RESEARCH PAPERS COME OUT SAYING THAT A NEW HABIT HAS BEEN CAUSING YOU CANCER THIS WHOLE TIME AND THAT OLD HABIT ISN'T AS BAD AS WE ASSUMED
HE SOUNDS AS IF HIS PHILOSOPHY HAS TAKEN ROOT IN SCIENTISM WHICH IS PRETTY HOSTILE TOWARD PHILOSOPHY HE ALSO SEEMS TO DISPROVE HIS OWN THEORY THAT THE EGO DOESN'T EXIST
MAYBE PHILOSOPHY SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT EVERYONE BUT YOU
I'VE ALWAYS FELT LIKE PHILOSOPHY ENCOURAGED ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY DO AND WHY THEY DO IT AND AS A RESULT WHAT PEOPLE DO AND WHY THEY DO IT THEY THEN SEEK LEGITIMACY FOR THEM TO BEHAVE THE WAY THEY BEHAVE
WE SHOULD DEAL WITH PROBLEMS OF MANKIND BUT NOT FOR THE SAKE OF MANKIND SO THAT EVERYONE SHOULD SEE FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD TO BE BRAINWASHED BY OTHER PHILOSOPHER EVEN THOUGH THIS COULD MAYBE LEAD BACK TO DOING IT FOR MANKIND
REMOVED
WHILE I DO STILL THINK THAT SOME ELEMENTS PHILOSOPHY MAYBE JUST SOME OF THE TOOLS HAVE AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN OUR SCIENTIFIC PURSUITS OUR DISCOURSE ON RIGHT AND WRONG OUR POLITICAL POSITIONING AND SOME OTHER NICHES I GENERALLY AGREE THAT SOME MAYBE MOST PHILOSOPHY AMOUNTS TO LITTLE MORE THAN ARMCHAIR PONDERING WITH LITTLE CONNECTION TO THE REAL WORLD AND TOO MANY RUN-ON SENTENCES
BUT IS THIS A SELF-INDULGENT VIEW OR AN ARROGANT ONE HE EITHER FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF SELF-INDULGENT PHILOSOPHY THEREBY CALLING HIS VIEWS INTO QUESTION OR HE DOESN'T BUT BY MAKING THIS STATEMENT AND NOT INCLUDING HIS OWN VIEWS AS POSSIBLY SELF-INDULGENT THEN HE SEEMS ARROGANT IF ARROGANCE IS THE CASE THEN HIS HUBRIS ALSO CALLS THESE VIES INTO QUESTION
DELETED
TO BE TOTALLY HONEST I'M TAKING WHAT HE'S SAYING WITH A GRAIN OF SALT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE LIKES OF RICHARD DAWKINS AS A PHILOSOPHER IS WORRYING AS THERE IS MUCH PHILOSOPHICAL VALUE IN RELIGIOUS CULTURE THIS ISN'T SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION PARTICULARLY THE CHRISTIAN ONE MIND YOU
WELL YOU LOOK AT HOW A LOT OF GREAT PHILOSOPHERS THROUGHOUT TIME HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW FUCKED UP THE WORLD IS I THINK WE ARE ALL STARTING TO REALIZE THAT YOU CAN'T FIX STUPID THOUSANDS OF YEARS WORTH OF GREAT IDEAS AND ALTERNATIVES HAS DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IF ANYTHING AS A SOCIETY WE HAVE GONE BACKWARDS SO A PHILOSOPHER THAT WASN'T SELF INDULGENT IN THIS TIME WOULD NOT EVEN REMOTELY BE HEARD NO ONE RIGHT NOW WANTS TO HEAR HOW FUCKED UP OUR WORLD IS PHILOSOPHY THESE DAYS IS TREATED LIKE CONSPIRACY THEORIES PEOPLE WOULD RATHER LIVE THEIR IGNORANT BLISSFUL RELIGIOUS PROLETARIAT LIVES

THE ONLY WAYS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN A FIELD LIKE THIS ARE TO WRITE BOOKS AND HOPE YOU GET RECOGNIZED AFTER DEATH OR SPEAK AS A VOICE OF THE PEOPLE REGARDLESS IT REQUIRES A FOLLOWING THE EASIEST WAY TO WOO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS DUMBED DOWN POINTLESS CLAIMS THAT THE GENERAL DUMBED DOWN POPULACE CAN RELATE WITH ASK A MILLION PEOPLE IF THEY KNOW OR BETTER YET CARE ABOUT PHILOSOPHY MOST DON'T I BELIEVE DARWIN EVOLUTION THEORY IS STILL IN PLAY MOST HUMANS HAVE INTELLIGENCE NO GREATER THEN A MONKEY TALK ABOUT TAKING BUGS OFF EACH BACKS AND THEY WILL JUMP FOR JOY BECAUSE THEY CAN RELATE
I'M SORRY BUT WHAT I GOT FROM THIS WAS THAT DENNETT BASICALLY THINKS THAT HIS DISINTEREST IN THE CURRENT STATE OF ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY COUNTS AS A REASON TO THINK OF IT AS USELESS AND SELF-INDULGENT HE MAY THINK IT'S POINTLESS BUT CERTAINLY THOSE WHO ARE PRACTICING DO NOT AND WOULD OBVIOUSLY ARGUE THAT IT IS NOT POINTLESS I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT'S POINTLESS AND I'M NOT EVEN A PHILOSOPHY GRADUATE THIS MAKES DENNETT LOOK LIKE THE OLD MAN WHO DOESN'T LIKE WHERE HIS COUNTRY IS GOING AND COMPLAINS ABOUT IT UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE TRYING TO MAKE PHILOSOPHY SEEM MORE RELEVANT HE ENDS UP MAKING IT SEEM COMPLETELY UNIMPORTANT OR EVEN SILLY BY ARGUING THAT IT CURRENTLY IS UNIMPORTANT AND SILLY UNFORTUNATELY FOR DENNETT PHILOSOPHERS WILL STUDY WHAT THEY FIND INTERESTING DESPITE WHAT DENNETT PERSONALLY FEELS ABOUT THE SUBJECT DENNETT HAS AN AGENDA THAT MAY NOT MATCH WITH THE AGENDAS OF OTHERS AND HE CAN'T COMPLAIN UNLESS HE'S GOING TO EXPLAIN WHY HIS AGENDA IS SUPERIOR

WHAT WE NEED MORE OF IN ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY ARE PROJECTS INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON SMALLER ISSUES FOREVER LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE SEE HOW THESE INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS MESH TOGETHER INTO A COHERENT PICTURE OF REALITY BE CONSCIENTIOUS OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES

PROJECTS DEFINED THE GREAT THINKERS OF THE PAST ARISTOTLE WAS ARGUABLY THE FIRST TO PUT DOWN A TRULY SYSTEMATIC METAPHYSICAL FRAMEWORK IN WHICH PRACTICALLY EVERY OTHER PHILOSOPHER AND SCIENTIST IS INDEBTED TO THE SAME GOES WITH AQUINAS AUGUSTINE LEIBNIZ SPINOZA DESCARTES HUME KANT HEIDEGGER ETC

THE LAST MAJOR ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHER WHO MADE SUCH A METAPHYSICAL PROJECT HAPPEN THAT I CAN THINK OF IS DAVID LEWIS THE GUY WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAMOUS MODAL REALISM OF POSSIBLE WORLDS AND HE'S DEAD RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AN OVERFLOW OF PAPERS CONCERNING SPECIFIC METAPHYSICAL IDEAS IN PARTICULAR COMPOSITION AND BUT NOBODY SEEMS TO REALLY BE CONCENTRATED ON FORMULATING A BROADER PICTURE OF REALITY AND PUTTING ALL THESE PIECES TOGETHER THE NATURALIZED METAPHYSICIANS ARE SOMEWHAT UNIFIED UNDER A VAGUE CONCEPT OF SCIENTIFIC PRIORITY AND NATURALISM AND NEO-SCHOLASTICISM IS BEGINNING TO EMERGE BUT THESE ALSO CAN BE MORE REACTIONARY THAN ENLIGHTENING

A GREAT EXAMPLE I THINK OF A PHILOSOPHER WHO HAS CREATED SUCH A PROJECT IS MEILLASSOUX WHO IN LOOSE RELATION TO GRANT HARMAN AND BRASSIER HAS HELPED CREATE WHAT IS CALLED THE SPECULATIVE REALISM MOVEMENT MEILLASSOUX IN HIS BOOK AFTER FINITUDE POINTS OUT THE INHERENT CORRELATIONISM IS MODERN CONTINENTAL THOUGHT AND ARGUES THAT IF CORRELATIONISTS ARE TO BE HONEST THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY INFORM CERTAIN SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES SUCH AS COSMOLOGY OR GEOLOGY THAT WHAT THESE SCIENTISTS ARE STUDYING NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPENED PLACING PHILOSOPHY FIRMLY BEFORE SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE NOW MEILLASSOUX ISN'T AN ADVOCATE OF CORRELATIONISM PER SE BUT RATHER FORMULATES A SPECULATIVE REALISM THAT ATTEMPTS TO BY-PASS THIS EPISTEMIC GAP WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH HIM OR NOT PROJECT IS INDEED A PROJECT AND AN IMPRESSIVE ONE THAT AT IT'S TOO BAD CONTINENTAL AND ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY CONTINUES TO BE SEPARATED IN SOME SENSE THEY COULD LEARN A LOT FROM EACH OTHER
YEAH WELL SO IS LIVING AT ALL
PHILOSOPHY IS THE APPLIED MISUSE OF TERMS INVENTED FOR THAT PURPOSE

IF THAT HAS A FAMILIAR RING TO IT THEN QED IMO ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT HAS DOGGED PHILOSOPHY THROUGH THE AGES IS THAT THEOLOGY SOMEHOW GOT ELEVATED TO BEING A SERIOUS BRANCH OF PHILOSOPHY I SUSPECT THAT HAS HAD A HISTORICALLY DELETERIOUS EFFECT NOT ONLY ON PROGRESS WITHIN THE FIELD BUT ALSO ON WIDER PERCEPTIONS OF PHILOSOPHY GREATLY INHIBITING ITS APPEAL TO EVERYMAN AND FURTHER IMPEDING IT'S ADOPTION AS A WORTHWHILE SUBJECT

THE INESTIMABLE GAINS OF THE TH CENTURY CAME NOT SO MUCH FROM CEREBRAL OR MATERIAL PRODUCTS OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT AS FROM THE AVAILABILITY OF CHEAP FOSSIL FUELS THAT SHOULD BE EVIDENT FROM OUR INCREDIBLE FAILURE TO SLOUGH OFF THE USE OF THEM IN THE FACE OF GLOBAL WARMING PLS DON'T CALL IT CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S NOT ALARMING ENOUGH

CONSIDER THIS
A MAIN FEATURE OF THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION IS THE NECESSITY FOR COMPETITION HUMANITY WITH ITS CAPABILITY FOR LANGUAGE HAS EVOLVED INTO A SPECIES THAT LIES AS A MEANS OF COMPETING THUS IT HAS BEEN ARGUED THAT MANKIND ALSO DEVELOPED THE NECESSARY COUNTERPART TO WORTHWHILE LYING THE ABILITY FOR HUMANS TO BE DUPED NOTICE THAT CHILDREN BEGIN TO LIE IN ORDER TO GAIN ADVANTAGE THE SAME WEEK THEY LEARN TO SPEAK THIS OCCURS BEFORE THEY DEVELOP THEORY OF MIND

BUT THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY REQUIRE A SUSPENSION OF LYING IN ORDER TO SUCCEED THIS CREATES A HUGE DIVIDE BETWEEN HUMANITY AND HUMANITY'S INTELLECTUAL LEADERS BRIDGING IT REQUIRES THE ACCEPTANCE OF UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTHS BUT UNCOMFORTABLE MEANS THEY DON'T GET ACCEPTED BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
WELL A LOT OF PHILOSOPHY DEALS WITH QUESTIONS WHERE LITTLE TO NO CONSENSUS HAS BEEN REACHED MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS MAY BE MISGUIDED NOT HAVE AN ANSWER OR NOT HAVE AN ANSWER HUMANS COULD EVER DISCOVER FOR EXAMPLE THE HARD QUESTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS IT EVEN A MEANINGFUL QUESTION IS PHILOSOPHY CENTERED AROUND THIS ISSUE SELF-INDULGENT I WOULD SAY THAT WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE MAYBE WE WILL COME TO A CONSENSUS ON IT ONE DAY BUT MAYBE WE'LL KEEP RUNNING IN CIRCLES
THIS CRACKS ME UP BECAUSE I TOOK A CLASS WITH HIM AND HE RAMBLED FOR OF THE LECTURE
DOGMATISTS WHO THINK THEY'VE ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN ANSWER USUALLY DO THINK ATTEMPTS AT OTHER ANSWERS ARE FRUITLESS

UNFORTUNATELY FOR DENNETT HE HAS YET TO DISCOVER THAT HIS PHILOSOPHY IS MERELY A MODERN OF CARTESIAN DUALISM AND IS RATIONALLY UNTENABLE

HE'LL NEVER FIGURE IT OUT THOUGH BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY SURE HE HAS THE ANSWERS
CONCLUSION IS A MUCH MORE WELL-INFORMED WELL-READ VERSION OF WHAT I TELL PEOPLE WHEN DISCUSSING WHY I DIDN'T CONTINUE PAST UNDERGRAD PHILOSOPHY
WHEN RICHARD DAWKINS AND SAM HARRIS WERE MENTIONED AS PROMINENT PHILOSOPHERS I COULDN'T TAKE THE ARTICLE SERIOUSLY
REMOVED
DISCLAIMER I'M POSTING AN AD HOMINEM COMMENT HERE THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE VALIDITY OF THE OPS CLAIM

HE IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS LIVING

YES DANIEL DENNETT IS THE MOST ACADEMIC OF THE NEW ATHEISTS BUT LET'S NOT ACT LIKE HE IS A CHAMPION OF THE FIELD OF PHILOSOPHY ONE COULD ARGUE THAT HIS USE OF THE ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY TITLE TO PROMOTE HIMSELF AS ONE OF THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE NEW ACHIEST MOVEMENT WAS SELF-INDULGENT
THIS IS THE AORTA THING THAT TURNED ME OFF FROM PHILOSOPHY IN SCHOOL PRIVILEGED PEOPLE PATTING THEMSELVES ON THE BACK RATHER THAN DOING ANYTHING PRACTICAL
COULD THIS BE BECAUSE OVERTIME PHILOSOPHY HAS BECOME EITHER MORE OR LESS CONNECTED WITH SCIENCE AND STATISTICS AND MORE ABOUT JUST QUESTIONING EVERYTHING BASED ON THERE OWN MORAL STANDPOINT
REMOVED
REMOVED
EXCEPT WHEN WE YOU KNOW ACTUALLY DIE
THIS IS LIKE SAYING THAT THE WAVES IN A POND ARE THE PEBBLE WHICH CREATED THEM MAYBE IT IS GOOD AS BED TIME STORY FOR CHILDREN

ALL
SUCH

ARE
CONTROVERSIAL
IT
IS
TEMPTING
TO
THINK
THAT
THE
MORALITY
OF

IS
BY

INTER PERSONAL
WHY
WOULD
A

GIVE

TO

AS
AN

IF
IT

IN
THESE

A

TO

AND

I
WILL

THAT
THE
LACK

I
WILL

IT
DOES

VERY

OUR

SOUNDCLOUD PAGE COAMING SOON I DON'T HAVE ITUNES
FIRST TIP DON'T CALL IT THAT IT FEELS LIKE PEOPLE WILL EITHER PRONOUNCED IT OR
GONNA GIVE IT A TRY AND THEN I'LL FEEDBACK
LISTENING RIGHT NOW
THE XML FEED IS
PANPSYCHIST 2 FORMAT RSS
CHANGE THE NAME SERIOUSLY
JUST GONNA CHIME IN WITH MY TWO CENTS THAT THE NAME IS PERFECTLY FINE
THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS GIVEN US FEEDBACK WE'RE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS PROJECT AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SUGGESTED HAS BEEN EXTREMELY VALUABLE

IN REGARDS TO THE NAME AND SLOGAN I AGREE THE NAME HAS PRONUNCIATION ISSUES IT WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE MY RESEARCH FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON PANPSYCHISM THE INITIAL PURPOSE OF THE PODCAST WAS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOLS WHERE WE AND OUR FRIENDS ARE TEACHING THESE STUDENTS WILL ALREADY BE AWARE OF THE PRONUNCIATION OF AND SHOULD BE FINE WITH IF IT IS MISPRONOUNCED AS THIS IS WELCOMED IF NOT SLIGHTLY ENCOURAGED

THE RESPONSE WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING AND UNEXPECTED THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS SUBSCRIBED TO US IT WAS NOT OUR INTENTION FOR THE PODCAST TO GAIN TRACTION AND BECOME POPULAR OUTSIDE OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN FACT WE FEEL PODCASTS SUCH AS THE PARTIALLY EXAMINED LIFE HETP AND THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY WITHOUT ANY GAPS HETP PROVIDE A MORE APPROPRIATE STYLE AND SELECTION OF CONTENT FOR GENERAL AUDIENCES COMPARED TO OUR MORE FACTUAL EXAM PROJECT IF PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOLS ARE FINDING IT USEFUL AND ENGAGING THIS IS AMAZING THE MORE PEOPLE INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY THE BETTER IN THE FUTURE WE WILL AIM THE SHOW AT BOTH PUPILS AND WHILST CONTINUING TO PITCH IT AT AN POST HIGH SCHOOL STANDARD

GENERALLY SPEAKING THE PODCAST IS SUPPOSED TO BE A BIT OF FUN WE LECTURE OUR STUDENTS ALL DAY ENGAGING WITH THEM SOLELY IN A FORMAL MANNER DURING THE SCHOOL DAY SO WE ASKED HOW CAN WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONTINUE STUDYING PHILOSOPHY WHEN THE BELL GOES PHILOSOPHY CAN BE LAID BACK OUT OF HOURS IT CAN BE MORE PLAYFUL MORE BUDGIE THEY WEREN'T SEEING THIS SIDE TO IT SOMETHING I ENJOYED DURING MY UNDERGRAD WAS PUB PHILOSOPHY HETP TAKING PHILOSOPHY OUT OF ITS SERIOUS ACADEMIC SETTING INTO A MORE LIGHT-HEARTED INFORMAL SETTING CAN BE INCREDIBLY UNIQUE AND INSPIRATIONAL FROM OUR USE OF QUESTIONING TO THE STYLE AND CONTENT OF EACH CONVERSATION WE'RE THINKING PEDAGOGICALLY ABOUT EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING I HOPE THIS INSPIRES ALL OF OUR LISTENERS

THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL OF YOUR FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT TO THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE SUBSCRIBED WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO GO ON THIS JOURNEY WITH YOU WE'RE RECORDING THE NEXT EPISODE OF THE PANSYCAST I MEAN THE PANPSYCHIST NEXT WEEK THANK YOU AGAIN

JACK
I DON'T LIKE YOUR SLOGAN MISSION STATEMENT

HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE PANPSYCHIST A PHILOSOPHY PODCAST THAT ASPIRES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS OF PHILOSOPHY WE ALSO PLAN TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD STICK AROUND FOR DETAILS

YOU'RE NOT BUDGIE I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH BECAUSE IT DOESN'T PITCH AN INCLUSIVE IDEA AS YOUR AIM INSTEAD THE SLOGAN SEEMS TO BE ONE THOUGHT FOR ONE GOAL THROUGH IMPLICATION THUS ALIENATING AN AUDIENCE OF OUTSIDERS NEWCOMERS OR DIFFERENT OPINIONS WE'RE TAKING OVER COME JOIN US OR THE SLOGAN IS JUST MEANT AS A JOKE AND I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TAKE IT OR YOU SERIOUSLY IN WHATEVER YOUR REAL MISSION ACTUALLY IS SINCE YOU CHOSE TO NOT JUST GO WITH THAT INSTEAD

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS YOUR NAME COUPLED WITH YOUR SLOGANS ARE THE FIRST THINGS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE WHEN THEY COME TO YOU IF THEY DON'T FEEL WELCOME THE BUCK STOPS THERE RATHER THAN BEING ON THE PLAYFUL SIDE OF COME JOIN US IN OUR DOMINATION GOAL WHY NOT INSTEAD TAKE A MORE INCLUSIVE APPROACH LIKE

HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE PANPSYCHIST A PHILOSOPHY PODCAST THAT ASPIRES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS OF PHILOSOPHY WE AIM TO AWAKEN FELLOW FREE THINKERS ALL OVER THE WORLD STICK AROUND FOR DETAILS

PANPSYCHISM DOESN'T IMPLY A GROUP HIVEMIND AS THE CURRENT SLOGAN MIGHT SUGGEST PLEASE CONSIDER CHANGING IT AS PHILOSOPHY OUGHT TO BE PRESENTED IN AN ACCESSIBLE WAY WITH DIGNITY IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE IT TO BE AN IMPORTANT ENDEAVOR
I HAVE TWO WORRIES ABOUT THIS

FIRST WHAT MIGHT BE AN EXAMPLE OF THE THIRD SORT OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS THE AUTHOR THINKING OF TWIN EARTH CASES OR SOMETHING MORE REMOTE LIKE ZOMBIES

SECOND THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THE THIRD KIND OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS UNDERDEVELOPED WHAT NOTION OF SENSE DATA IS BEING USED HERE AND WHY ARE THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS THAT INCLUDE STIPULATED FACTS OTHER THAN THOSE THAT CAN BE KNOWN BY SENSE DATA ON LESS FIRM FOOTING THAN THOSE THAT INVOLVE ONLY STIPULATED FACTS THAT CAN BE KNOWN BY SENSE DATA THE CONCEPTUAL LINK BETWEEN CONCEPTUAL INTUITIONS AND SENSE DATA IS NOT MADE CLEAR HERE
I WOULD SAY THE CHINESE ROOM ARGUMENT IS ACTUALLY AN EXAMPLE OF THE THIRD KIND OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENT GIVEN HERE NOT THE SECOND IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS A LOGICAL FRAMEWORK BUT THE CONCLUSION DOESN'T FOLLOW FROM THE PREMISES THEREFORE IT ISN'T SOUND DANIEL DENNETT COINED THE PHRASE INTUITION PUMP IN TALKING ABOUT THE CHINESE ROOM

IN CONSCIOUSNESS EXPLAINED HE USES THE TERM TO DESCRIBE JOHN CHINESE ROOM THOUGHT EXPERIMENT CHARACTERIZING IT AS DESIGNED TO ELICIT INTUITIVE BUT INCORRECT ANSWERS BY FORMULATING THE DESCRIPTION IN SUCH A WAY THAT IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS OF THE EXPERIMENT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE AND TEND TO BE IGNORED
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THE FIRST KIND OF THOUGHT EXPERIMENT IS USUALLY CALLED DOING MATHEMATICS OR CALCULATING LOGIC IN THE EXAMPLE HE GIVES THESE ARE EMPIRICAL CALCULATIONS JUST LIKE WORKING OUT THE TRAJECTORY OF A THROWN BALL
THE AUDIO IS VERY POOR AND THE SLIDES ARE NOT SHOWN DIRECTLY I'M AFRAID THIS IS BASICALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS
THIS IS A FREE ONLINE PHILOSOPHY COURSE BEING RUN BY CASPAR HARE PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AT MIT PROFESSOR HARE WILL ALSO BE DOING AN AMA TOMORROW AT EST PLEASE SEE THIS POST WHERE YOU CAN SUBMIT QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME OR JOIN US TOMORROW IN WELCOMING PROF HARE TO OUR COMMUNITY

THE COURSE BLURB IS AS FOLLOWS



THIS PHILOSOPHY COURSE HAS TWO GOALS THE FIRST GOAL IS TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE THINGS THAT PHILOSOPHERS THINK ABOUT WE WILL LOOK AT SOME PERENNIAL PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS IS THERE A GOD WHAT IS KNOWLEDGE AND HOW DO WE GET IT WHAT IS THE PLACE OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD DO WE HAVE FREE WILL HOW DO WE PERSIST OVER TIME AS OUR BODILY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAITS CHANGE

THE SECOND GOAL IS TO GET YOU THINKING PHILOSOPHICALLY YOURSELF THIS WILL HELP YOU DEVELOP YOUR CRITICAL REASONING AND ARGUMENTATIVE SKILLS MORE GENERALLY ALONG THE WAY WE WILL DRAW FROM LATE GREAT CLASSICAL AUTHORS AND INFLUENTIAL CONTEMPORARY FIGURES

YOU CAN READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE COURSE HERE AT MIT NEWS THERE'S ALSO A PIECE AT INSIDE HIGHER ED HERE ABOUT THE GRADING OPTION



WOW WHAT AN AWFUL ARTICLE

CAN ONE MAN A MAN WHO DIED IN BE BLAMED FOR NAZISM COMMUNISM AND EVEN THE UPRISINGS IN PLACES LIKE MILWAUKEE AND FERGUSON

DRINKING GAME TAKE A SHOT EVERY TIME THIS ARTICLE LOW-KEY COMPARES BLM WITH NAZIS

KARL POPPER LEO STRAUSS AND AYN RAND ALL SUGGESTED G WEST F HEGEL THE GREATEST PHILOSOPHER OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY CONTRIBUTED TO THE MOST MALIGNANT TOTALITARIAN SYSTEMS IN HISTORY

HE ALSO INSPIRED MARX WHO WAS IS ONE OF THE FATHERS OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY NUANCE IS A NECESSITY WHEN TALKING ABOUT HEGEL BUT I WOULDN'T EXPECT ANY FROM AYN RAND

HEGEL INTERPRETED REALITY AS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN TWO COMPETING IDEAS THE THESIS AND LIKE ATOMS THEY ARE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF ALL VISIBLE EVENTS AFTER INTENSE CONFLICT THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THESE ANTAGONISTIC IDEAS RESOLVES WITH THE EMERGENCE OF A SYNTHESIS WHICH ADOPTS ELEMENTS FROM THE THESIS AND THUS CREATING A NEW LEVEL OF REALITY ANOTHER THESIS AND EMERGE FROM THE SYNTHESIS AND THE PROCESS BEGINS ANEW THIS IS THE DIALECTIC MORE SPECIFICALLY THE IDEALIST DIALECT SINCE IT S BASED ON CONFLICT BETWEEN IDEAS

THIS IS A GROSS OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC AND DIALECTICS IN GENERAL HEGELIAN ANALYSIS AND OTHER DIALECTICAL ANALYSES ARE ALWAYS MORE COMPLICATED THAN BUT IT SEEMS NO ONE BOTHERS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT

TRANSLATING AUFHEBUNG AS SYNTHESIS HAS BEEN DEBATED BUT I DON'T SPEAK GERMAN SO I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE FACT THAT IT IS DEBATED

HEGEL WAS A HOLIST SO HE BELIEVED THAT INDIVIDUALS DON T EXIST IN ISOLATION BUT ARE FORMED BY THE LARGER GROUP

YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT YOUR FREE WILL IS LIMITED BY THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR REALITY INDIVIDUALS DON'T MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE COMING INTO PLAY AND THIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ARISE FROM THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS ALTHOUGH I'M MORE OF A MATERIALIST THAN HEGEL SO I'D ARGUE THESE CONDITIONS ARE MATERIAL NOT IDEOLOGICAL LIKE MARX SAID PEOPLE MAKE THEIR OWN HISTORY BUT THEY DO NOT MAKE IT JUST AS THEY PLEASE THEY DO NOT MAKE IT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES CHOSEN BY THEMSELVES BUT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES DIRECTLY ENCOUNTERED GIVEN AND TRANSMITTED FROM THE PAST

ACCORDINGLY BOTH NAZIS AND COMMUNISTS WERE

ALSO AN INACCURACY BASED ON OVERSIMPLIFICATION I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE NAZIS ALTHOUGH SOME CLASSICAL FASCISTS DREW HEAVILY FROM NIETZSCHE BUT DEFINING THE COMMUNISTS AS IS ENTIRELY AHISTORICAL AND AN UNJUSTIFIED GENERALIZATION PERHAPS VARIOUS AUTHORITARIAN INTERPRETATIONS OF MARXISM LIKE LENINISM MAOISM ETC APPARENTLY THE ONLY COMMUNISTS WORTH TALKING ABOUT IT'S LIKE ANARCHISM DOESN'T EXIST OPPOSED THE INDIVIDUAL BUT MANY MARXISTS AND ANARCHISTS MYSELF INCLUDED SEE COMMUNISM AS A RECONCILIATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL VS SOCIETY DICHOTOMY THIS WAS WRITTEN TO EXPLAIN HOW THE DIALECTICAL PROGRESSION OF INDIVIDUAL SELFISHNESS PROGRESSES TOWARDS COMMUNISM OR COMMUNISM BEING THE HIGHEST FORM OF EGOISM

IF YOU'RE GOING TO GENERALIZE AT LEAST PRETEND TO BE NUANCED

ALL OF THEIR ACTIONS ARE NOT DETERMINED BY FREE WILL BUT THE CONDITIONS THAT REARED THEM IN THIS CASE WHITE SOCIETY FOR A SECOND LET S ASSUME THE WORST AND THAT THE YOUNG BLACK MEN WERE KILLED DUE TO THEIR RACE BUT WHY CAN T THIS BE INTERPRETED AS ONE INDIVIDUAL WITH KILLING ANOTHER CAN T THE POLICE OFFICERS JUST BE BAD APPLES DO THEY HAVE TO REPRESENT A BIGGER DEEPER ISSUE IN AMERICA

AGAIN ANY INDIVIDUAL'S FREE WILL IS LIMITED BY THEIR REALITY YOU ARE DEALT CARDS BUT GET TO CHOOSE HOW TO PLAY THOSE CARDS ONCE THEY ARE DEALT IN THE CASE OF POLICE OFFICERS EACH INDIVIDUAL COP THAT KILLS AN UNARMED BLACK MAN IS ACTING IN THEIR OWN FREE WILL BUT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT DECISION ONLY AROSE DUE TO THE REALITY AROUND THEM

LIKE THE PERSON IN THE MONTAGE LITTLE DETAILS DON T MATTER

LOOK IN A FUCKING MIRROR

WHETHER THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE INDIVIDUALLY RACIST IS A MOOT POINT THE PROTESTORS KNOW OR THINK THEY KNOW BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE REALITY OF AMERICAN SOCIETY IS IT POSSIBLE THAT RACE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SHOOTING THE YOUNG MAN OF COURSE IT IS BUT FOR THE PROTESTORS THIS INTERPRETATION DOESN T CONFORM TO THEIR REALITY A REALITY THAT ASSERTS THE EXISTENCE AN CLASS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE OPPRESSIVE WHITE RACE

ACCUSE YOUR OPPONENTS OF PROJECTING THEIR NARRATIVE ONTO REALITY WHILE PROJECTING YOUR SIMPLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF COMMUNISM ONTO HISTORY STAY CLASSY

MARX TOOK HEGEL S IDEAS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHERS AND BROUGHT IT TO THE STREETS THROUGH WORKS LIKE THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO

THE MANIFESTO ISN'T A SERIOUS PHILOSOPHICAL TREATISE IT'S MORE OF AN INTRODUCTION TO SOME BRIEF IDEAS MARX HAD AND SOME OF THE IMMEDIATE GOALS OF COMMUNISTS DURING HIS TIME I DON'T REMEMBER A HEAVILY RELIANCE ON DIALECTICS BUT IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE I'VE READ IT



ANYWAY THIS NONSENSE BELONGS IN R BADPHILOSOPHY CRAWL BACK OVER TO R YOU FIT IN MORE OVER THERE AS DEMONSTRATED BY YOUR POST HISTORY
IT'S INSTRUCTIVE TO NOTE WHAT OTHER SUBS THIS WAS SUBMITTED TO
HEGEL INTERPRETED REALITY AS A STRUGGLE BETWEEN TWO COMPETING IDEAS THE THESIS AND LIKE ATOMS THEY ARE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF ALL VISIBLE EVENTS AFTER INTENSE CONFLICT THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THESE ANTAGONISTIC IDEAS RESOLVES WITH THE EMERGENCE OF A SYNTHESIS WHICH ADOPTS ELEMENTS FROM THE THESIS AND THUS CREATING A NEW LEVEL OF REALITY ANOTHER THESIS AND EMERGE FROM THE SYNTHESIS AND THE PROCESS BEGINS ANEW THIS IS THE DIALECTIC MORE SPECIFICALLY THE IDEALIST DIALECT SINCE IT S BASED ON CONFLICT BETWEEN IDEAS

THIS RIDICULOUS ARTICLE CAN'T EVEN GET THE WIKIPEDIA VERSION OF HEGEL RIGHT

HEGEL WAS A HOLIST SO HE BELIEVED THAT INDIVIDUALS DON T EXIST IN ISOLATION BUT ARE FORMED BY THE LARGER GROUP ACCORDINGLY BOTH NAZIS AND COMMUNISTS WERE

AS OPPOSED TO WHAT INDIVIDUALS EXISTING IN TOTAL ISOLATION
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT RACE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SHOOTING THE YOUNG MAN OF COURSE IT IS BUT FOR THE PROTESTORS THIS INTERPRETATION DOESN T CONFORM TO THEIR REALITY A REALITY THAT ASSERTS THE EXISTENCE AN CLASS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE OPPRESSIVE WHITE RACE

THE REALITY IS THE INEQUALITY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ONE EMPIRICALLY OBSERVABLE THROUGH THE DISPARITY IN INCARCERATION RATES AND SENTENCING LENGTHS A REAL CONCRETE OBSERVABLE MATERIAL CONDITION

HEY LOOK AT THAT I JUST TIED BLM TO MARXIST MATERIAL DIALECTICS MUST BE FAULT TOO

HEGEL HAS BEEN THE REACTIONARY BOGIEMAN FOR AS LONG AS THERE HAS BEEN A HEGEL THE DEADHORSE THEY CAN'T HELP BUT TO KEEP BEATING I SWEAR YOU COULD WRITE THIS ARTICLE WITHOUT EVER HAVING READ IT THESE ARGUMENTS ARE SO CYCLICAL
SOMEONE'S ONCE READ THE PREFACE TO AN INTRODUCTION TO HEGEL AND WROTE AN ARTICLE

THIS IS QUITE BAD
REMOVED
THIS IS THE LATEST VIDEO IN OUR BRAND NEW ON EPISTEMOLOGY AND THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE

SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO GEOFF LYNN NORTHERN ILLINOIS INTRODUCES VIRTUE EPISTEMOLOGY AN APPROACH TO EPISTEMOLOGY THAT TAKES INTELLECTUAL VIRTUE AS THE CENTRAL CONCEPT IN DISCUSSIONS OF THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE ALONG THE WAY HE SHOWS HOW VIRTUE EPISTEMOLOGY CAN PROVIDES INTERESTING SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE ENCOUNTERED SO FAR IN THE SERIES

THIS SOUNDS LIKE A RANDOMLY GENERATED ARTICLE

A BIT LIKE THE CHOPRA WISDOM GENERATOR HETP

OR THE POSTMODERNISM GENERATOR

I HAD A GOOD CHUCKLE
THANK YOU FOR THIS IT GIVES ME AN EXCUSE TO DUST OFF MY PURPLE BIBLE
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

SO AVICENNA IS UNDERAPPRECIATED EVEN THOUGH HE'S BASICALLY THE ONLY ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHER ANYONE KNOWS BUT IBN KHALDIAN WHO WAS HEGEL YEARS BEFORE HEGEL DOESN'T EVEN MAKE THE LIST

WIKI
IS ALSO WORTHWHILE TO LOOK INTO HE WAS REALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRADITION AND AVERROES NOT AS I HAD SAID INCOHERENCE OF THE INCOHERENCE IS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO HIS INCOHERENCE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS WHICH ESSENTIALLY CONDEMNS NEOPLATONISM IN ISLAM AS HERETICAL AND DOES SO THROUGH USE OF PHILOSOPHY IT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT IN A WAY HE WAS HUME BEFORE HUME HE EVEN DENIES CAUSATION AS A KNOWABLE RELATION TO BASICALLY MAKE FUN OF THE ABILITY OF PHILOSOPHY TO DISCERN TRUTH
I DONT KNOW WHY BUT THIS POST KIND OF MOTIVATES ME AS A SYRIAN I CAN STILL HAVE A PLACE IN THIS WORLD THANKS
FOR TRULY GREAT PHILOSOPHY GO READ SOHREVARDI
ALSO MOST OF ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY IS FROM IRANIANS
YOU CAN READ GREAT PHILOSOPHY HIDDEN IN POEMS OF MOLALA HAFIZ KHAYA AND OTHERS BUT SOHREVARDY IS ON A DIFFERENT CORBIN HAS WRITTEN SOME BOOKS ABOUT HIM AND ISLAMIC READ THAT
FOR PEOPLE HOW DIDN'T READ ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY AND CAME HERE TO CONNECT ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY TO CURRENT STATE OF MUSLIMS AND ISLAM YOU ARE SO STUPID THEY'RE GREAT AND IT'S YOUR LOSS FOR NOT READING IT
RED INTELLECT IS RECOMMENDED BUT FOR PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY'S CORE AS A PERSIAN IT TOOK ME AROUND SEVEN YEARS TO PARTIALLY UNDERSTAND IT
SAD THAT AL HASN'T BEEN INCLUDED ON THIS LIST MANY OF HIS WRITINGS ESPECIALLY HIS POEMS CONTAINED PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS ARGUABLY AHEAD OF HIS TIME

FOR INSTANCE TAKE THIS CRITICISM OF RELIGION

O FOOLS AWAKE THE RITES YOU SACRED HOLD
ARE BUT A CHEAT CONTRIVED BY MEN OF OLD
WHO LUSTED AFTER WEALTH AND HAVING GAINED THEIR LUST
DIED IN BASENESS AND THEIR LAW IS DUST

AS TRANSLATED IN WHY I AM NOT A MUSLIM BY IBN WARRAM
COOL THAT THE LIST DOESN'T ONLY INCLUDE THINKERS FROM AROUND A D BUT MORE MODERN ONES TOO I HAVE HEARD MUCH GOOD THINGS ABOUT MERNISSI BUT READ ANYTHING BY HERALDRY ANY ONE HERE HAVE ANY OPINIONS REGARDING HER
AVICENNA IS UNDER APPRECIATED AVICENNA AND AVERROES ARE THE MOST WELL KNOW MUSLIM PHILOSOPHERS IN THE WESTERN
IBN RUSH AVERROES
OK SO IT BOTHERED ME THAT I COULD NOT GO THROUGH THE LIST WHILE ON MOBILE THE WHOLE DAY SOMEONE ELSE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS FOR THOSE IN THE SAME PREDICAMENT AS MYSELF FOLLOW THIS LINK WHICH IS BASICALLY A BUT MOBILE FRIENDLY

AS FOR THE LIST ITSELF IT SEEMS INDEED THAT SOME OF THE GREAT MINDS ARE MISSING BUT OTHER GREAT MINDS ARE INCLUDED AVICENNA IS FAR FROM BEING UNDERAPPRECIATED WHILE AVERROES WHO IS ON THE SAME LEVEL IS NOT ON THE LIST

BUT ONE WHOSE PHILOSOPHICAL WORK IS TRULY UNDERAPPRECIATED IS OMAR KHAYYAM WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN PLAGUED BY BEING A GREAT POET POPULARISED IN THE CENTURY BY EDWARD FITZGERALD WHILE PRIOR TO THAT BEING PLAGUED BY BEING A GREAT MATHEMATICIAN I MEAN TRULY GREAT FOR THOSE INTERESTED HETP HAS SOME RESOURCES LIKE POETRY AND MATHEMATICAL ACHIEVEMENTS WHILE THE SEP ARTICLE IS ABOUT HIS PHILOSOPHICAL WORKS THE AUTHOR OF THE SEP ARTICLE HAS WRITTEN A GREAT BOOK BY THE TITLE WINE OF WISDOM
HUH THIS IS A SURPRISING LIST

IT DOES NOT MENTION OR OR ALTHOUGH THESE ARE PRIMARILY THEOLOGIANS THEY STILL HAD A MASSIVE INFLUENCE ON PHILOSOPHY

NO MENTION OF IBN KHALDIAN AS U SLASH POINTS OUT

AVICENNA IBN SINA MAKES THE LIST AVERROES IBN RUSH DOESN'T

MULLA MADRA IS ABSENT

NO IBN TAYMIYYA ALTHOUGH HE IS MORE OF AN LOVE HIM OR HATE HIM HIS IMPACT WAS SIGNIFICANT

FROM THE MODERN THINKERS THEY HAD ABDU AND MERNISSI BUT NO SIR MUHAMMAD IQBAL

STRANGE CHOICES ALTHOUGH I LOVE S PODCAST
GAON WAS A JEWISH RABBI GAON IS AN HONORIFIC FOR CHIEF RABBI OF A COMMUNITY MIGHT AS WELL CALL MAIMONIDES ISLAMIC
IS GHAZZALI NOT ON THE LIST BECAUSE HES APPRECIATED
AWESOME THANK YOU SO MUCH

WE NEED MORE OF THIS STUFF TO REMIND ISLAM OF ITS GLORIOUS PAST
THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK PETER ADAMSON IS PRETTY COOL HIS HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY PODCAST IS AMAZINGLY IN DEPTH DO RECOMMEND IT'S EASILY FOUND ON THE PODCAST APP FOR IPHONE
WONDERFUL CAN'T WAIT TO READ UP ON THEN
REMOVED
REMOVED
I HAVE NOT HEARD OF MANY OF THESE THE LIST STILL LACKS A FEW PEOPLE THAT I SEE OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED ON BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IBN TAYMIYYAH DID NOT GET ON THE LIST

HE WAS LIKE A MUSLIM WITTGENSTEIN NOT EXACTLY BUT HAD SOME SIMILARITIES WORKED WITH WHAT CAN PHILOSOPHY SAY AND NOT SAY AND THAT SORT OF THING
REMOVED
REMOVED
REMOVED

I LOVE PHILOSOPHY THOUGH I'M NOT IN THE FIELD I TOOK YOUR MDOC INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY AND I PARTICULARLY LOVED THE SECTION ABOUT KNOWLEDGE IT WAS VERY THOUGHT PROVOKING

AS A NURSE I BRIEFLY STUDIED ETHICS AND DEONTOLOGY IN SCHOOL AND I LIKED IT BIOETHICS SPECIFICALLY AND WISH I COULD LEARN MORE ABOUT IT BUT I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO START DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS
DR HARE

DISAGREEMENTS IN PHILOSOPHY ARE KNOWN TO BE THE NORM INCLUDING IN ETHICS I AM MORE THAN SLIGHTLY WORRIED THAT THE MULTITUDE OF ETHICAL THEORIES AFFECTS REAL LIFE DECISION-MAKING NEGATIVELY AS WELL AS WEAKENS ETHICAL THINKING IT'S AS IF A DE FACTO MORAL RELATIVISM IS BEING MAINTAINED IMPLICITLY APPARENTLY BY EVERYONE DO YOU BELIEVE THIS RELATIVISM TO BE A DESIRABLE STANDARD WITH THESE IN MIND WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD A DEONTOLOGIST HAVE TO SAY TO A CONSEQUENTIALIST TO HAVE THE LATTER ADOPT HIS POSITION AS THE CORRECT ONE AND VICE VERSA PREDICTABLY MY SCENARIO ALSO APPLIES TO VIRTUE ETHICISTS AND ALL THE REST MORE PERSONAL WHAT WOULD ANOTHER PERSON HAVE TO ADVANCE WITH REGARDS TO YOUR OWN THEORY IN ORDER FOR YOU TO ADOPT HIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE AND THEN PROCEED FROM THERE

FOR YOUR INFORMATION I ASK AS AN OUTSIDER WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE A REAL LIFE ETHICAL PROBLEM

THANKS
HELLO DR HARE AND THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AMA I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU

WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE EASTERN PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPT OF MEDITATIVE RENUNCIATION

2 WHAT ACCORDING TO YOU IS THE PURPOSE OF PHILOSOPHY NOT WHY SHOULD SOMEONE STUDY IT BUT WHEN SHOULD IT BE STUDIED
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WORK OF MICHAEL THOMPSON
HELLO PROFESSOR HARE FROM ALL THE COURSES IN PHILOSOPHY I'VE TAKEN SO FAR YOURS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE

ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY SEEMS TO BE GOING DOWNHILL WITH OF DEPARTMENTS AND PROMINENT FIGURES CRITICIZING THE FIELD WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING DONE TO IMPROVE ITS SECURITY

2 SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT PHILOSOPHY ISN'T SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE WELL WHAT IS EXPERTISE IN PHILOSOPHY HOW TO DISTINGUISH A GOOD PHILOSOPHER FROM A BAD ONE

HOW DID YOU BECOME INTERESTED IN PHILOSOPHY WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO PURSUE PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHY

AS A BEGINNER PHILOSOPHY STUDENT IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO START WITH IN MY RESEARCH TO BUILD A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION AND MOVE TO NORMATIVE ETHICS AND PRACTICAL ETHICS LATER
CAN A SOUND AND CONVINCING ARGUMENT BE PROVEN WRONG BY SCIENCE ARE THERE PROMINENT EXAMPLES OF THAT
I WOULD ARGUE THAT PLATO IS TALKING ABOUT SPIRITUALITY AND ENLIGHTENMENT HERE GIVING A METAPHOR FOR THE ELUSION MYSTERIES OF WHICH HE SAID CONCERNING THE LESSER MYSTERIES THE ULTIMATE DESIGN OF THE MYSTERIES WAS TO LEAD US BACK TO THE PRINCIPLES FROM WHICH WE DESCENDED A PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF INTELLECTUAL SPIRITUAL GOOD

IN THAT SAME WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE CICERO IS QUOTED AS SAYING

AMONG THE MANY EXCELLENT AND INDEED DIVINE INSTITUTIONS WHICH YOUR ATHENS HAS BROUGHT FORTH AND CONTRIBUTED TO HUMAN LIFE NONE IN MY OPINION IS BETTER THAN THOSE MYSTERIES FOR BY THEIR MEANS WE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT OUT OF OUR BARBAROUS AND SAVAGE MODE OF LIFE AND EDUCATED AND REFINED TO A STATE OF CIVILIZATION AND AS THE RITES ARE CALLED INITIATIONS SO IN VERY TRUTH WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THEM THE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE AND HAVE GAINED THE POWER NOT ONLY TO LIVE HAPPILY BUT ALSO TO DIE WITH A BETTER HOPE

CICERO LAWS II XIV



AS TO WHAT THE ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE MEANS IN THE CONTEXT OF SPIRITUALITY THAT DEPENDS ON THE SPIRITUAL TRADITION BUT THE DESCRIPTION OF PAIN UPON AWAKENING TO THE REAL WORLD AND THEN DECIDING TO RETURN TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T AWAKENED IN ORDER TO HELP THEM IS A COMMON THEME THROUGHOUT ALL THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS AND SPIRITUAL TRADITIONS

JUST A THOUGHT


SORRY FOR ANY TYPOS OR GRAMMATICAL ERRORS I SEE A FEW SPOTS WHERE I COULD HAVE USED DIFFERENT WORDING AND ALSO SOME WHERE I ADDED SOME WORDS WITHOUT FIXING SURROUNDING WORDS CAPITAL LETTERS ETC JUST TRYING TO HURRY AND GET AN EDIT IN BECAUSE MY LAST POST HAD COMMENTS FROZEN I'M NEW TO REDDIN BUT I'M TRYING TO LEARN THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS EXCUSE MY BUMPS AND BRUISES IN THE PROCESS
EDIT MOVED REPLY UP TO CORRECT SPOT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE WORLD OF SHADOWS FROM THE ALLEGORY IS CONTROLLED
YOUR GENERAL POINT SEEMS TO BE THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS SURE NO ISSUES HERE HOWEVER THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD TAKE ALL VIEWPOINTS AS PLAUSIBLE OR NOT RULE OUT CERTAIN ONES JUST BECAUSE OF THE SORT OF REASONING THAT PRODUCED THEM

THE GENERAL ISSUE WITH CONSPIRACY THEORIES NARROWLY CONSTRUED IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE SOLID EVIDENCE BEHIND THEM IF THEY DID WE WOULD NO LONGER CALL THEM CONSPIRACY THEORIES MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY SEEM TO BE IMMUNE TO DISPROOF ALL REASONABLE INDICATIONS THAT THEY ARE INCORRECT ARE EXPLAINED AWAY AS LIES COVERUPS ETC BY THE SUPPOSED CONSPIRATORS IF A VIEWPOINT CANNOT BE DISPROVED BY ANY POSSIBLE EVIDENCE THIS IS USUALLY A SOLID INDICATION THAT IT'S ULTIMATELY VACUOUS SO IF SOMEONE WANTS US TO ACCEPT A CONSPIRACY THEORY OF THIS SORT WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REASON NOT TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY UNTIL UNLESS IT CAN BE JUSTIFIED WITH BETTER REASONING


I THINK THAT SEEKING A PROOF THAT YOU AREN'T BEING ENSNARED BY SHADOWS JUST ALLOWS YOU TO BE ENSNARED BY SHADOWS OF LOGIC AND CERTAINTY ALSO NEEDING OTHERS AGREEMENT OR TO CONVINCE THEM SEEMS A RECIPE TO BE ENSNARED BY SHADOWS IF YOU ARE FINDING LIGHT YOUR CALM ACTIONS BASED ON IT WILL BE A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF CONVINCING OTHERS
TURING MACHINES DON'T PRODUCE THEOREMS IN LANGUAGES THAT THEY KNOW THE MEANING OF ANY MORE THAN YOUR NEURONS PRODUCE LIES BY NOT FIRING WHEN THEY KNOW THEY SHOULD

AND OF COURSE A TURING MACHINE COULD BE PROGRAMMED TO PRESENT A THEOREM AS BEING TRUE WHEN IT KNOWS IT'S NOT TRUE WITHOUT BEING INCONSISTENT

YOU'RE MIXING LEVELS OF FORMALISM AS WELL AS FAILING TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU MEAN SO FURIOUSLY IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE EVEN SAYING

WHAT LANGUAGE DO YOU THINK L IS WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE

WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR A TURING MACHINE TO KNOW A THEOREM IS TRUE OR DERIVABLE
YOU HAVE A VERY RIGOROUS DEFINITION OF LIE HERE SO IM NOT SURE THAT YOU'VE PROPERLY EVIDENCED PREMISE I'LL PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE AND TRY TO UNDERMINE YOUR ARGUMENT BY ATTACKING THIS PREMISE

OF COURSE HUMANS CAN LIE IN THE NORMAL SENSE BUT YOUR DEFINITION OF A LIE IS MUCH DIFFERENT FOR A PERSON TO LIE IN THE NORMAL SENSE HE FIRST MUST KNOW I AND THEN HE MUST CONVINCE SOMEONE ELSE OR HIMSELF THAT I IS TRUE HE DOES NOT USE A FORMAL PROOF BECAUSE PROVING A FALSE STATEMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A CONSISTENT TM THUS HE ONLY USES INCOMPLETE EVIDENCE TO MAKE I PLAUSIBLE

FOR A LIE TO OCCUR UNDER YOUR ARGUMENT A PERSON WOULD HAVE TO PROVE I FIRST AND THEN PROVE I HUMAN LIES DO NOT WORK THIS WAY SO YOU HAVENT PROPERLY JUSTIFIED PREMISE

THEREFORE AS WE HAVE NOT PROPERLY JUSTIFIED PREMISE THE CONCLUSION DOES NOT FOLLOW
A THEOREM WHICH PRODUCES A GENUINE LIE IS A THEOREM CONCERNING THE EFFECT OF THE LIE VS THE EFFECT OF THE TRUTH YOU CAN DEDUCE A CORRECT THEOREM ABOUT YOUR OWN TARDINESS KNOW THAT IT'S TRUE THEN DEDUCE A THEOREM TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHY COMMUNICATING A PARTICULAR LIE IS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST IT'S NOT THE NEGATION OF A TRUE THEOREM IT'S A SECOND TRUE THEOREM BUILT UPON THE FIRST IN ESSENCE A GENUINE LIE IS A TRUE THEOREM IT SHOULDN'T EVEN PRESENT MUCH OF A CHALLENGE TO CREATE A STORED PROGRAM THAT TELLS GENUINE LIES I EAST LIES FOR EFFECT BASED ON SOME LIMITED THEORY OF MIND EAST G ONLY LIKES ROUND NUMBERS LET ALONE ONE THAT RANDOMLY TELLS WILLFUL UNTRUTHS
THE TITLE SHOULD BE ARGUMENT FOR WHY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE HUMAN MIND TO BE THIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF TURING MACHINE SPECIFICALLY A TYPE OF TURING MACHINE THAT CAN'T LIE FOR ANYTHING A HUMAN CAN DO I COULD GENERATE A SIMILAR CLASS OF TURING MACHINES AND A SIMILAR ARGUMENT YOUR ARGUMENT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER I COULD CREATE AN ENCODING OF A HUMAN MIND THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH A UNIVERSAL TURING MACHINE
IF A TURING MACHINE IS ABLE TO KNOW THEOREM I TO BE TRUE THEN IT MUST BE ABLE TO OUTPUT THEOREM I AND NOT BE ABLE TO OUTPUT I

BEFORE THAT YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE YOUR TURING MACHINE LEGS AND EYES IF IT IS NOT A PROPER AGENT EMBEDDED IN A WORLD IT HAS NO GROUNDING FOR TRUTH ALSO IT WOULD NEED TO BE PART OF A SOCIETY AND USING A LANGUAGE OF SOME KIND TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHER AGENTS

IF THE TM IS A MEMBER OF A SOCIETY AND COMMUNICATES BY LANGUAGE THEN LYING BEHAVIOR IS VERY PROBABLE TO EMERGE AS LONG AS EACH TM BEHAVES IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE ITS OWN REWARDS SELFISHLY

OF COURSE A TM CAN LIE

PROOF HERE IS A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT TELLS A LIE

PRINT 2 2

QED
THE OP IS NOT AN ARGUMENT FOR WHAT A TURING MACHINE CAN SAY BUT WHAT IT CAN BELIEVE OR DERIVE TO BE TRUE WHAT SUCH A MACHINE WOULD SAY IF IT WOULD SAY ANYTHING WOULD BE IN FURTHERANCE OF A GOAL IF IT DEVELOPED A THEORY THAT FURTHERING ITS GOAL REQUIRED IT TO COMMUNICATE MESSAGE X THEN WHETHER IT HAD A THEORY ON THE TRUTH OF X MAY BE IRRELEVANT

WATCH V ARF

EDIT TYPO
WHY IS DERIVING A THEOREM A BARRIER TO PRESENTING A THEOREM IN LANGUAGE L THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING PREVENTING A TURING MACHINE GENERATING A LIST OF FALSE THEOREMS AND OUTPUTTING THEM AFTER ALL

YOUR ARGUMENT SEEMS TO RELY PURELY ON EQUIVOCATION BETWEEN PROVING AND PRODUCING A THEOREM BUT OF COURSE A HUMAN LIAR DOESN'T PROVE THE STATEMENT THEY'RE LYING ABOUT OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE A LIE JUST A MISTAKE THEY MERELY PRODUCE IT IN THE SENSE OF SPEAKING WRITING OTHERWISE OUTPUTTING THE LIE WHICH A TURING MACHINE IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF TOO
IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY WHAT YOU ARE REALLY SAYING IS THAT A TM THAT CALCULATES I CORRECTLY CAN NOT CALCULATE I INCORRECTLY THIS IS JUST A TAUTOLOGY

WHEN A HUMAN LIES THEY DO NOT MAKE AN ERROR IN LOGIC A HUMAN CAN CORRECTLY CALCULATE I AND THEN REPORT ITS INVERSE A TM CAN BE PROGRAMMED TO DO THE SAME THING COMPUTES I FEEDS ITS OUTPUT TO WHICH INVERTS IT SINCE THIS KIND OF COMPOSITION CAN BE REPRESENTED AS A SINGLE MACHINE WITH THE ADDITION OF A SINGLE DETERMINISTIC STATE TRANSITION I HAVE PROVEN BY CONSTRUCTION THAT YOU CAN BUILD A TM THAT LIES ACCORDING TO YOUR DEFINITION REPORTS I AFTER INTERNALLY COMPUTING I AND KNOWING IT

THIS CAN BE MADE MORE OR LESS HUMAN LIKE BY CHANGING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE SECOND TM INVERTS ITS INPUT EITHER OR IN RESPONSE TO OTHER INPUTS IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU FED A TM A NUMERIC REPRESENTATION OF WHAT IT'S INTERESTS WERE AND HOW THE TRUTH WOULD OR WOULDN'T LIKELY EFFECT ITS INTERESTS YOU COULD PROGRAM A TM TO LIE WHEN IT WAS IN IT'S OWN INTEREST

FOR EXAMPLE CONSIDER A COMPUTER WITH A THERMOMETER THAT REPORTS THE TEMPERATURE AND ALSO KNOWS THAT ITS PROCESSORS WORK BETTER IN COLDER CONDITIONS IT COULD THEREFORE BE PROGRAMMED TO THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE CHANCES THAT THE COOLING SYSTEM WOULD BE TURNED ON NOTHING IN THIS CONSTRUCTION IS OR REQUIRES MORE THAN READING AND WRITING TO MEMORY LOCATIONS TAPES YOU CAN REPLACE THE THERMOMETER WITH A RANDOM ORACLE THAT IS ACCORDING TO A DETERMINISTIC STRATEGY IF YOU'RE SO INCLINED
YOU ALREADY LOST ME AT PREMISE

MY POSITION IS THAT TURING MACHINES ARE NOT CAPABLE OF KNOWING THINGS IN THE SAME WAY THAT HUMANS ARE ABLE TO KNOW IDEAS OR FACTS

IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT THE HUMAN MIND HAS SOME SORT OF UNEXPLAINED POWER AND READING ON IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU'RE RELYING ON THAT PREMISE

I'D PROPOSE THAT ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT A HUMAN MIND HAS IS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF A VERY COMPLEX MACHINE AND ANY SORT OF LYING THAT A HUMAN CAN DO A THEORETICAL TRUING MACHINE ALSO CAN DO




AND THE PROOF THAT A HUMAN MIND ISN'T A TURING MACHINE IS ACTUALLY QUITE TRIVIAL

A TURING MACHINE HAS INFINITE MEMORY A HUMAN MIND DOES NOT
A SYSTEM OR ENTITY CAN COMMIT A LIE IF AND ONLY IF IT CAN DIRECTLY OUTPUT A THEOREM IN LANGUAGE L I AS BEING TRUE EVEN THOUGH IT KNOWS THE NEGATION OF THE THEOREM I TO BE TRUE

THIS IS NONSENSE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT FORMAL LOGICAL SYSTEMS AND DO NOT OUTPUT THEOREMS IN LANGUAGES IE FORMAL SYSTEMS

PREMISE IF A TURING MACHINE IS ABLE TO KNOW THEOREM I TO BE TRUE THEN IT MUST BE ABLE TO OUTPUT THEOREM I AND NOT BE ABLE TO OUTPUT I

YOU'VE SMUGGLED IN DEFINITIONS OF KNOW ABLE AND OUTPUT HERE THAT APPLY ONLY TO FORMAL SYSTEMS IN MATHEMATICAL LOGIC AND NOT TO HUMAN BEINGS NOR TO ANY EXTENT COMPUTATIONAL OR STATISTICAL THEORY OF THE MIND NOR TO ANY PROPOSED MODELS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

THIS IS UTTER RUBBISH PLEASE DON'T TURN IT IN TO WHATEVER CLASS YOU ARE TAKING COMPOSE SOMETHING DECENT THAT CAN EARN A PASSING GRADE
OK I COMMITTED TO READ LINE BY LINE I GOT STUCK ON THE FIRST POINT

DEFINITION A SYSTEM OR ENTITY CAN COMMIT A LIE IF AND ONLY IF IT CAN PRESENT A THEOREM IN LANGUAGE L I AS BEING TRUE EVEN THOUGH IT KNOWS THE NEGATION OF THE THEOREM I TO BE TRUE

IN A FORMAL SYSTEM I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS FOR A PROPOSITION TO BE TRUE OR NOT I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHETHER IT FOLLOWS LOGICALLY FROM THE AXIOMS VIA THE RULES OF DEDUCTION

TO TALK ABOUT TRUTH I HAVE TO PICK A MODEL SOME PROPOSITIONS ARE TRUE IN EVERY MODEL THOSE ARE THE THEOREMS THAT FACT NEEDS PROOF IT'S ESSENTIALLY COMPLETENESS THEOREM WHICH RELATES SYNTAX TO SEMANTICS

IN ANY EVENT I GOT STUCK HERE BECAUSE I STARTED WORRYING WHAT IF THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY BETWEEN THEORIES AND MODELS BETWEEN SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS AND WHAT IF THIS OBFUSCATES THE ARGUMENT

IF I'M ALL WET AND OBSESSING ON A MINOR SEMANTIC POINT MAYBE YOU MEANT I IS A THEOREM AND NOT I IS TRUE JUST TELL ME SO

OR MAYBE IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT NEEDS CLARIFICATION JUST ASKING I LIKE TO UNDERSTAND EACH STEP AS I GO
IF A CONSISTENT TURING MACHINE

WHY WOULD A TURING MACHINE NECESSARILY BE CONSISTENT
YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING THAT TO LIE WE MUST LOGICALLY DEDUCE WHATEVER STATEMENT CONSTITUTES THE LIE TO BE TRUE THATS NOT THE CASE
ALRIGHT I BOUGHT THE GAME ALREADY STOP WITH THE SUBTLE MARKETING
ANOTHER CONCERN

PREMISE IF A TURING MACHINE IS ABLE TO KNOW THEOREM I TO BE TRUE THEN IT MUST BE ABLE TO DERIVE THEOREM I AND NOT BE ABLE TO DERIVE I

AGAIN CONFLATING THEORIES AND MODELS VALIDITY WITH TRUTH

ALSO IF A TM IS INCONSISTENT THEN IT CAN DERIVE I AND I YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT CONSISTENT TMS IN THE NEXT SENTENCE THEREFORE YOU SHOULD REWRITE PREMISE SO THAT IT IS ACCURATE

ALSO TMS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING A GIVEN TM COMPUTES A PARTICULAR FUNCTION IT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS RECOGNIZING A CERTAIN SET OF STRINGS BUT IT'S NOT RECOGNIZING LIKE YOU OR I RECOGNIZE ANYTHING YOU APPLY AN ALGORITHM TO A STRING AND IT HALTS ON THE STRINGS YOU CARE ABOUT THERE IS NO KNOWING INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS AND I WONDER IF THIS IS PERHAPS WHERE YOU MIGHT BE GETTING A LITTLE OFF TRACK

TMS DON'T LIE OR TELL THE TRUTH THEY FLIP BITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH A PROGRAM THEY'RE PURE SYNTAX NO MEANING IS ATTACHED TO ANYTHING A TM DOES IT'S PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE THE MEANING
THANKS FOR POSTING THIS GOLD MINE
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT LOOKING UP SOME OF HIS MATERIAL SAM HARRIS DID AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM IN EARLY JULY WAS GOOD
DELETED
THANKS FOR THIS CURRENTLY READING FREEDOM EVOLVES AND FINDING IT VERY INTERESTING I'LL HAVE TO CHECK OUT SOME OF HIS ACADEMIC WORK
I READ SOME OF HIS STUFF WAS PRETTY INSPIRING THANKS FOR PROVIDING THIS
REMOVED
ELI PLEASE
NEOPLATONISM WAS ALIVE AND WELL WITHIN CHRISTIANITY BEFORE PSEUDO-DIONYSIUS
REMOVED
IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED THIS IS PROCLUS BOOK ON PLATONIC THEOLOGY THAT PSEUDO-DIONYSIUS WAS SUPPOSEDLY ATTEMPTING TO PRESERVE WITHIN THE DIVINE NAMES IN ONE SENSE YOU COULD SAY THAT MAKES THE DIVINE NAMES UNNECESSARY SINCE WE HAVE THE ACTUAL EXOTERIC PLATONIC PAGAN THEOLOGY OUT IN THE OPEN BUT OTOH IT IS LIKELY THAT THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN PROCLUS AND A SUPPOSED DIRECT DISCIPLE OF IS WHAT LEAD HIS WORK TO BE PRESERVED IN THE 1ST PLACE IN WHICH CASE MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

YOU CAN READ THE FULL TEXT AT WIKISOURCE

WIKI

AND THE TRANSLATOR HAS A BIT OF AN INTERESTING BACKSTORY HIMSELF

WIKI NEOPLATONIST
THAT WAS LIKE BEAUTIFUL
THANKS FOR THAT IT'S A REAL SHAME THAT WE DON'T GET TO SEE MORE ACADEMIC PAPERS IN THE UK WHEN WE PAY TAXES FOR THESE ACADEMICS AND THEN COMPANIES LIMIT THEM TO PAYING CUSTOMERS WHO PAID FOR THE ACADEMICS AND THE BUILDINGS AND THE LIBRARIES IT'S A COMPLETE CON IT'S A LICENCE TO PRINT MONEY BY THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES
THIS WAS ESTABLISHED A LONG TIME AGO BY ONE LORENZO VALLA

HE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DECLARATION OF CONSTANTINE WAS A FORGERY

BOTH THESE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE GIGANTIC EMBARRASSMENTS FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ESSENTIALLY DESTROYING THEIR LEGITIMACY BUT IT WAS KINDA SWEPT UNDER THE RUG BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS

MAKE NO MISTAKE THE CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY PRESSED BY STREET THOMAS AQUINAS WHO QUOTES PSEUDO-DIONYSIUS A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF TIMES WAS AN INFILTRATION INTO CHRISTIANITY BY PLATONISTS WORKING IN SYRIA AND THE CLAIM TO BE THE HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER FRAUD

EDIT GOT THE RIGHT STREET
I HAVE HEARD IT SAID THAT IF ONE READ THE NEW TESTAMENT BY A PLATONIC INTERPRETATION IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE CERTAINLY MORE SENSE THAN WITHOUT IT
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A CONFUSING SENTENCE BEFORE
THIS TITLE IS THE BEST THING IVE READ WITH NO CONTEXT TO ITS MEANING
THIS IS AN HISTORICAL AND NOT A PHILOSOPHICAL CLAIM
HI R PHILOSOPHY
R PAGAN CURRENTLY HAS THIS AS THE TOP POST SO US PAGANS WILL HANG AROUND HERE FOR A WHILE
THIS SUB IS GREAT DIDN'T KNOW IT EXISTED BEFORE
WOW MAKES MY DESIRE TO READ THE BOOK I BOUGHT THAT MUCH MORE
THERE WERE MANY WHO SOUGHT TO MIX PAGANISM INTO CHRISTIANITY IT'S APPARENT IF YOU GO DEEP THERE ARE EVEN GREEK TEXTS OF THE BIBLE WITH GREEK PHILOSOPHY INJECTED INTO THEM SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA CHANGE ONE WORD TO CHANGE THE WHOLE SENTENCE ANYWAYS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH KINDA DENIES THIS FOR THE MASSES BUT PEOPLE IN THE KNOW CAN TELL YA

I'LL GIVE YOU A NAME TO GO WITH THIS STATEMENT ORIGEN A CHRISTIAN TEACHER

HE PUT A LOT OF OUTSIDE MATERIAL INTO EARLY CHRISTIANITY
THE JESUS STORY IN THE GOSPELS IS FILLED WITH STORIES THAT ARE VARIATIONS OF THOSE ORIGINALLY BELONGING TOO PAGAN GODS AND MEN

THE BREAD AND FISHES STORY IS A RETELL OF ELIJAH WHO DOES THE SAME MIRACLE ON A SMALLER SCALE

THE WATER INTO WINE IS A RETELL OF A DIONYSIUS STORY

PRACTICALLY EVERY JESUS MIRACLE IS A RETELL

CHRISTIANS STOLE THE JEWISH BIBLE AND HIJACKED THE CONCEPT OF THE MESSIAH AND PRETENDED IT WAS JESUS EXCEPT HE WASN'T JUST ASK ANY JEW

IT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING THAT GOD IN THE NT IS NEVER NAMED MY THEORY IS THAT WAY HE MATCHES ANY GOD FOR ANY PERSON REGARDLESS OF RELIGION OR CULTURE MOST GODS IN THOSE PLACES WERE VERY SIMILAR JUPITER WAS THE SAME AS ZEUS AND SO ON I FACT ZEUS WAS PRONOUNCED VERY CLOSELY TO DEUS IT'S JUST THE Z CHANGED IN ENGLISH
REMOVED
IF ANYONE REALLY WANTS TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT NIETZSCHE WAS ON TO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS LECTURES SET BY DR JORDAN B PETERSON MAPS OF MEANING ITS AN EXTRAORDINARY SYNTHESIS OF NIETZSCHE JUNG DARWIN FREUD NEUROPSYCHOLOGY RELIGION AND THE PHENOMENOLOGIST AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE

PLAYLIST LIST
YOU COULDN'T HAVE POSTED THIS AT A BETTER TIME I'M TAKING AN PHILOSOPHY CLASS RIGHT NOW AND THIS ECHOES SOME OF MY THOUGHTS IN A WAY I COULDN'T ARTICULATE SO WELL I FEEL LIKE A LOT OF WHAT WE DISCUSS IN CLASS IS BASED ON UNSPOKEN ASSUMPTIONS THAT I HAVE DIFFICULTY RECONCILING WITH MY OWN NIHILISTIC PRAGMATIC WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS MAYBE I CAN EVEN USE THIS IN A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT LOL THANKS FOR SHARING OP

WHEN PEOPLE SUPPRESS THEIR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS IT LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE EMPATHY AND MAKES ETHICAL BEHAVIOR NO LONGER SYNONYMOUS WITH SELF-INTEREST YOUR EMOTIONS COME FROM ONE VALVE YOUR FEELINGS AREN'T A SUBWAY SANDWICH YOU CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE

I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT THIS IS ON THE FRONT PAGE AT MIDNIGHT ON A FRIDAY BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON REDDIN RIGHT NOW ARE PROBABLY DEPRESSED IN SOME WAY

EMBRACE YOUR PAIN AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SHARE THE JOY OF OTHERS

NIETZSCHE SAYING MORALITY WEAKENS SOMEONE IS LIKE SOMEONE WITHOUT EYES SAYING ARCHING A SUNSET WEAKENS SOMEONE

IT WEAKENS THE PERSON WHO CANNOT BENEFIT BUT THAT'S BECAUSE SAID PERSON HAS SOMETHING MISSING NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE STRONGER THAN OTHERS
IS NIETZSCHE ARGUING FOR TOTAL MORAL RELATIVISM HERE I CAN'T AGREE WITH HIM IF THAT'S THE CASE IT SOUNDS LIKE A YEAR OLD BEING CONTRARIAN WITHOUT REALLY CONSIDERING THE IMPLICATIONS OF HIS ARGUMENT I KNOW HE'S MUCH SMARTER THAN THAT BUT SOMEONE HELP ME OUT HERE
NIETZSCHE REALLY LIKED HIS SISTER
REMOVED
ILL JUST COMMENT HERE TO SAVE THE VIDEO FOR LATER THANKS
REMOVED
WHEN THE LAWS A SOCIETY PASSES ONLY BENEFIT THOSE WHO PASS THE LAWS THEN YOU HAVE TYRANNY CREATING LAWS THAT PUNISH THOSE AT THE BOTTOM OF PYRAMID WHILE REWARDING THOSE AT THE TOP IS A CLEAR SIGN OF OPPRESSION ONLY A REVOLT FROM THE BOTTOM CAN BRING ABOUT REAL CHANGE REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE IN A CORRUPT SYSTEM IS ONE WAY TO FIGHT THOSE AT THE TOP WE DO NOT HAVE POLITICIANS WE HAVE NEW NOBLES THAT SERVE THEIR ELITE AND POWERFUL KINGS AND QUEENS BUT THOSE IN POWER HAVE NONE BECAUSE THE SLAVES ARE WAKING UP IT IS OUR JOB AS FREE THINKERS TO WAKE UP THE PLEBS AND SLAVES BY WORKING WITH THEM AGAINST THOSE WHO THINK THEY HOLD POWER TRUE POWER COMES FROM GOD AND EMBRACING THE SUFFERING OF THE POOR SERVES AS AN ENLIGHTENMENT THAT ONLY BENEFITS YOU AND ME BUT IT ALSO ENLIGHTENS THOSE WHO YOU HAVE PUBLIC DISCOURSE WITH GOD UNITES US BUT WE HAVE TO SEEK OUT THOSE WHO SHARE OUR VIEWS NOT THOSE WHO ONLY EXIST TO ENSLAVE US TRUE REVOLUTIONS BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM WHEN OUR MORALS AND BELIEFS ARE CHALLENGED WITH OPPRESSIVE LAWS THAT GO AGAINST THE COVENANT OF GOD WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR BELIEFS THE TEN COMMANDMENTS EXIST AS OUR FOUNDATION THEIR LAWS GO AGAINST OUR COVENANT WITH GOD THEY SEEK TO DESTROY OUR MORALS BUT WE KNOW BETTER SO WE REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE SINCE ALL THEY DO IS CHAIN US AND BEAT US WHEN WE SPEAK OUT AGAINST THEM VIOLENCE BEGETS VIOLENCE SO THE ONLY COURSE OF ACTION IS TO STAY SILENT AND WATCH SOCIETY BURN AND DESTROY ITSELF FROM WITHIN NO GOD MEANS NO COUNTRY ONLY RED AND BLUE STATES
NIETZSCHE IN ONE OF HIS BOOKS THE JOY OF SCIENCE HE COULDN'T STOP MENTIONING HOW MUCH HE LOOKED DOWN ON HUMANS HE WAS A SELF-PROCLAIMED COLD BLOODED BERMENSCH WHO IN MOST CASES UNFORTUNATELY WAS IN MY OPINION CORRECT BUT STILL A HEARTLESS BASTARD NOW THAT'S MY MORAL JUDGMENT IN THIS SO CALLED REALITY AN SICH
I HAVE POINTED THIS OUT BEFORE AS HAVE SEVERAL OTHER PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHERS SOME OF WHO ARE ANTINATALISTS LIKE MYSELF THAT FORMAL ARGUMENT THE ASYMMETRY IS LOGICALLY FLAWED AND FUNDAMENTALLY DEPENDS ON MATERIAL ARGUMENT THE GENERAL MEDIOCRITY SHITTINESS OF LIFE

THE FORMAL ARGUMENT IS FLAWED BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONSISTENTLY USE COUNTERFACTUAL IF THEN PROPOSITIONS THE ABSENCE OF PLEASURE IS TAKEN TO ONLY BE BAD IF THERE IS SOMEONE ACTUALLY THERE TO EXPERIENCE THE DEPRIVATION THUS UTILIZING A COUNTERFACTUAL POSSIBLE PERSON OR LACK THEREOF HOWEVER THE ABSENCE OF PAIN IS TAKEN TO BE GOOD REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A PERSON THERE FOR WHOM THIS ABSENCE IS GOOD BENATAR EXPLICITLY STATES THAT HIS ASYMMETRY IS GROUNDED IN THE INTERESTS OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PEOPLE IN WHICH CASE THE INTERESTS OF POTENTIAL PEOPLE WOULD EXTEND FROM MERE ABSENCE OF PAIN TO THE COLLECTION OF PLEASURES

BENATAR ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THIS IN HIS BOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE BUT REJECTS IT NOT OUT OF LOGIC IN WHICH THE FORMAL ARGUMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE BASED UPON BUT OUT OF DISBELIEF OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS ACCEPTANCE HE THINKS IT IS TOO STRONG OF A VIEW TO THINK THAT THE ABSENCE OF PLEASURE IS BAD AND TOO WEAK OF A VIEW TO THINK THAT THE NON-EXISTENCE IN GENERAL IS NEUTRAL AND THUS CALLS THESE VIEWS INCOHERENT BUT THERE IS NOTHING INCOHERENT ABOUT THESE CLAIMS FOR THEY ARE INDEED LOGICALLY VALID THEY MAY NOT BE PLAUSIBLE OR PRAGMATIC BUT THIS GOES OUTSIDE OF THE FORMAL AND INTO THE MATERIAL SOMETHING BENATAR EXPLICITLY REJECTS

AND I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING IMPLAUSIBLE ABOUT RECOGNIZING THAT THE ABSENCE OF PLEASURE IS BAD CERTAINLY THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANYTHING WRONG WITH LAMENTING THE PREVENTION OF PLEASURE JUST AS WE MAY REJOICE AT THE PREVENTION OF PAIN

FURTHERMORE THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL DIFFICULTY IN THAT IF THE ASYMMETRY IS INDEED SOMEHOW LOGICALLY VALID THEN THE UNIVERSE IS LITERALLY OVERFLOWING WITH GOOD WHICH SEEMS IMPLAUSIBLE WHAT IS MORE PLAUSIBLE AND INDEED LOGICAL IS THAT THE UNIVERSE WITHOUT AGENTS IS NEUTRAL AND THE ADDITION OF EMOTIONAL AGENTS CAN MAKE THIS EITHER BETTER OR WORSE

IN REGARDS TO MATERIAL ARGUMENT I THINK HE IS ON POINT ESPECIALLY WITH HIS MENTION OF THE POLLYANNA PRINCIPLE HOWEVER I THINK HE MISSES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TOUCH UPON THE INHERENT STRUCTURE OF LIFE THAT MAKES IT BAD SUCH AS THE NEVER-ENDING STRIVING OR THE TERMINABILITY OF BEING

SO I THINK BOOK IS VALUABLE NOT BECAUSE IT IS FOOL-PROOF AND PERFECT BUT BECAUSE IT HAS THE LITERARY BALLS TO QUESTION SOMETHING SO CULTURALLY SIGNIFICANT AS BIRTH IN THE OPEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THOSE WITH RESERVATIONS ABOUT BIRTH HAVE A TERM THEY CAN IDENTIFY WITH IF NOTHING MORE IT OPENS THE DOOR TO BETTER DEEPER AND MORE PENETRATING STUDIES INTO THE HUMAN CONDITION THAT RESULTS IN THE SAME CONCLUSION MOST IMPORTANTLY THOSE OF THE SO-CALLED HISTORICAL PHILOSOPHICAL PESSIMISTS

I JUST HOPE THAT ANTINATURALISM DESPITE BEING A TERM COINED BY BENATAR CAN AS A MOVEMENT DISTANCE ITSELF FROM THE FORMAL ARGUMENT AND NOT DEPEND ON IT AS MUCH AS MANY OF ITS PROPONENTS DO I SAY THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A FLAWED CONCEPT THAT IF TAKEN TO BE SCRIPTURE COULD RESULT IN PEOPLE DISMISSING ANTINATURALISM OUT OF HAND WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE OTHER ARGUMENTS TO BE HAD FOR THIS VIEW
I CAME ACROSS THIS BOOK A WHILE AGO AND ITS TITLE WAS SUFFICIENT TO INSURE MY INTEREST IN IT I INSTANTLY THOUGHT OF CIOBAN OR ADORNO AND HIS RADICAL NEGATIVITY EVEN THOUGH HIS NEGATIVITY IS PREDICATED ON THE IDEA THAT THINGS CAN AND OUGHT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THEY ARE
IT'S A BOOK I'M STILL IN THE PROCESS OF PERUSING SO I DON'T FEEL TOTALLY COMFORTABLE EXPOUNDING ON IT UNTIL I'VE COMPLETED IT

BUT I WILL SAY THAT WHILE THERE IS NO CONCEPT OF GOD IN THE BOOK AS FAR AS I HAVE GOTTEN THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ELEMENT OF THEODICY DEPLOYED HERE I HOPE THE NUMBER OF THIS THREADS COMMENTS GO UP LET'S GET THE DISCUSSION GOING
THESE ARE GREAT IF A BIT DRY AT TIMES
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE OF A SUMMARY OF WHITE MAN PHILOSOPHY MUCH OF WHICH HAD EXISTED IN OTHER NON-WHITE CIVILIZATIONS PRIOR GREAT CONTENT NONETHELESS THE PHILOSOPHY IS STILL PHILOSOPHY REGARDLESS OF WHO SAYS IT
I HAVE THAT BOOK I'M PRETTY FAR INTO IT BUT I CAN START IT OVER
THE WEB ARCHIVE HAS THE COMPLETE TEXT ONLINE FOR FREE THIS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA BY FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE

WHAT A COINCIDENCE I PICKED IT UP AT THE BOOK STORE LAST WEEK FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN I NEVER READ ENOUGH IN MY LIFE

IN THE TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION THERE IS THIS FROM THE GAY SCIENCE

THE LIVING BEING IS ONLY A SPECIES OF THE DEAD AND A VERY RARE SPECIES

I'M IN
I TRY TO READ THAT BOOK AT LEAST FOR TIMES BUT COULDN'T FINISH IT READING IT NEEDS SERIOUS BACKGROUND IMO
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A BOOK I JUST KNEW THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA AS THE THEME SONG FROM A SPACE ODYSSEY
AND THE SUB IS R PHILOSOPHYBOOKCLUB
THERE'S A RECORDING OF HIS BOOK DONE BY VOLUNTEERS OVER ON LIBRIVOX FOR WHEN YOUR EYES GET TIRED
HEY I WAS JUST STARTING TO READ THE BOOK I'VE NEVER JOINED IN A GROUP READING BEFORE JUST IN TIME
THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOKS NIETZSCHE HIMSELF SAID THAT IF YOU DON'T FIND YOURSELF LAUGHING AND CRYING WHILE C READING IT YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT THE KAUFMAN TRANSLATION IS PURE GOLD
SO I'VE NEVER BEEN TO THIS SUB BEFORE SOUNDS GREAT HOW FAR INTO THE BOOK ARE WE TO BE BY THE SEPTEMBER 5TH DISCUSSION
COME LET US KILL THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON SOME BACKGROUND READING TO HELP ESTABLISH CONTEXT BEFORE DIGGING IN
SO HERE IS THE GERMAN TEXT AS PDF
NIETZSCHE
THIS IS RELEVANT TO MY UNDERNAME
READING THE FRENCH TRANSLATION RIGHT NOW
DELETED
IS THIS BOOK CHALLENGING FOR BEGINNERS I JUST STARTED COLLEGE AND AM TAKING PHILOSOPHY I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE CLASS AND THE SUBJECT ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO READ THIS WITH YOU GUYS I'M TAKING A LEVEL EXISTENTIALISM CLASS THIS SEMESTER HOPE TO HAVE SOME FUN TALKING THIS OVER WITH YOU FELLAS
PERFECT TIMING I AM A HUGE FAN OF WORK I BOUGHT THE BOOK IN ADVANCE AND AM PLANNING TO START ON IT AS SOON AS I FINISH THE GAY SCIENCE
OOOO COURSE THE REDDIN BOOK CLUB IS READING THUS
MAN I ACTUALLY JUST STARTED READING IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I LOVE HOW IT'S WRITTEN AND I WAS SO INVESTED IN THE FIRST PART THAT IT JUST SORT OF FLEW BY THEN THE SECOND PART FELT LIKE IT SORT OF STAGNATED AND I HAVEN'T STARTED THE THIRD YET DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A PHILOSOPHY BOOK CLUB SUBREDDIT THOUGH DEFINITELY SUBSCRIBING TO THAT
THIS IS AWESOME I BOUGHT A COPY OF THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND I'M SO EXCITED TO READ IT WITH YOU GUYS PHILOSOPHY IS BEST DONE WITH OTHERS
MAN YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO READ THIS WITH OTHERS IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS NOW I CANT HELP BUT FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD BE A PRETENTIOUS MESS TO CHAT WITH PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET INSIDE HAVE I LOST MY THE FIRE INSIDE OR DID I JUST FINALLY FIGURE OUT IN PRACTICE WHAT NIETZSCHE HAD BEEN SAYING ABOUT PHILOSOPHERS
ZARATHUSTRA HAS SOME PRETTY TERRIBLE THINGS TO SAY TO WOMEN
HOW DOES THE PACE WORK
COVERED IT IN SCHOOL BUT NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE WORK AS A WHOLE THIS'LL BE A GOOD REASON TO DELVE BACK INTO IT FOR BETTER OR WORSE
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO READ THIS BOOK FOR A VERY LONG TIME MY ONLY CONCERN IS THAT IT MIGHT BE A BIT TOO DENSE AND DRY FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND IT SOMEWHAT FULLY HOW ARCHAIC IS THE DICTION SYNTAX IS IT COMPARABLE TO ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE TIME PERIOD I'M SORRY IF THESE ARE FOOLISH QUESTIONS FOR THIS SUBREDDIT
I'VE READ EXCERPTS OF IT IN VARIOUS CLASSES I JUST GRADUATED SO I AM EXCITED TO KEEP MY PHILOSOPHY CHOPS UP AND BE ABLE TO DISCUSS WITH OTHERS
AS ONE WHO WAS ONCE REFERENCED AS MY FAIREST ZARATHUSTRA I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS AND WOULD LIKE TO PARTAKE
I'M JUST GOING TO BLINK
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO READ THAT
BOUGHT A COPY AWHILE BACK BUT STILL HAVEN'T READ IT THIS IS PERFECT
NOT GONNA LIE PRETTY PUMPED ABOUT THIS NIETZSCHE MIGHT COME OFF AS AN ASSHOLE FROM TIME TO TIME BUT BOY IS HE POWERFUL
THATS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE BOOK BY PROBABLY MY FAVORITE PHILOSOPHER AND IM PRETTY SURE HEARING THE OPINIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS OF REDDIN ABOUT IT WILL MAKE ME UNHAPPY IF R PHILOSOPHYBOOKCLUB IS ANYTHING LIKE R PHILOSOPHY NIETZSCHE IS DIFFICULT
BUT I'LL CONTRIBUTE SOME
JUST MIGHT HAVE TO JOIN YOU GUYS ON THIS SOUNDS LIKE FUN I ALWAYS TOLD MY FAMILY THIS BUT IF MONEY WAS NEVER AN ISSUE I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY MAJORED IN PHILOSOPHY OR CLASSICAL LITERATURE IN COLLEGE
DO IT FOR THE TURNING DO IT
I'M IN I'VE BEEN TRYING TO READ THAT BOOK FOREVER

I'M GAME I ADORE THIS BOOK AND READ IT ANNUALLY
THIS IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING EAGER TO SEE WHAT REDDIN HAS TO SAY ABOUT MAGNUM OPUS
ANYONE HAD ANY SPARE COPY JUST LYING AROUND I'M KINDA STRAP FOR CASH AND MY LOCAL LIBRARY DOESN'T HAVE THAT BOOK
AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BOOK IN MY MIND IN FACT IT'S MY FAVOURITE CHANCE I JOIN IN
I ACTUALLY LOVED READING IT MAYBE I'LL BREAK IT OUT AGAIN
THAT'S AWESOME I JUST RANDOMLY PICKED THAT BOOK UP AT BARNES AND NOBLE THE OTHER DAY I'M DEFINITELY JOINING IN IT WILL BE GREAT MOTIVATION TO PICK IT UP AND START KNOWING I CAN TALK TO OTHERS ABOUT IT RIGHT AFTER SO EXCITED AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SUB EXISTED SOUNDS LIKE THE PLACE I WANNA BE THANKS OP
ALL RIGHT I'M IN
FINALLY CREATED AN ACCOUNT JUST TO JOIN THIS DISCUSSION I HAVE THE BOOK WILL BANG THE DUST OFF THE COVER
I HAVE TRIED READING IT BEFORE AND CONTEXT AS WELL AS INTELLECTUAL DIALOG WAS AN ISSUE FOR ME AND I USUALLY JUST PUT IT DOWN FOR SOME WILLIAM GIBSON OR THE LIKE PERHAPS THIS DISCUSSION WILL BE THAT MISSING INGREDIENT
I THOUGHT THAT BOOK WAS WELL REGARDED AS ANTI SEMITIC
I DID MY A LEVEL PHILOSOPHY ESSAY ON THAT BOOK DAMN NEAR KILLED ME UP FOR ANOTHER CRACK AT IT THOUGH
SOUNDS GREAT WHEN I TRIED TO JUST MAKE IT THROUGH TINY BOOK ON EXISTENTIALISM I HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT I KNEW TO READ PHILOSOPHY ON MY OWN WAS GOING TO BE FUTILE ENDEAVOR
I AM INTERESTED IN READING THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF GERMAN IDEOLOGY PARTICULARLY BY WAY OF ANALOGY CRITIQUE OF MAX STERNER AS SAINT MAX MARX CRITICISES STERNER WITH PASSAGES SUCH AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REVOLUTION AND STERNER S REBELLION IS NOT AS STERNER THINKS THAT THE ONE IS A POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ACT WHEREAS THE OTHER IS AN EGOISTICAL ACT BUT THAT THE FORMER IS AN ACT WHEREAS THE IS NO ACT AT ALL THE GERMAN IDEOLOGY BY MARX AND ENGELS CHAPTER THREE SAINT MAX II REBELLION CAN SATIRE OF MAX EGOISM BE EXTENDED TO A DECADENT NIETZSCHE
I AM INTERESTED IN NIETZSCHE AND HAVE TRIED TO READ SOME OF HIS BOOKS A FEW TIMES BUT MADE ALMOST ZERO PROGRESS EACH TIME AS I FIND IT SUCH DIFFICULT GOING I HAVE A DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I FIND IT VERY CRYPTIC

BUT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA AND I WILL JOIN IN IF I REMEMBER THANKS
THAT WAS SUCH A GOOD BOOK WE WILL SEE WHERE I AM AT IN THE PILE I NEED TO READ DOWN
I HAVE TRIED TO READ THIS BOOK MANY MANY TIMES
IM STILL LIKE ONLY PAGES IN THAT BOOK IS AN INSANELY HARD READ
GREAT I BOUGHT THAT BOOK A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED IT I'M IN
I'VE BEEN READING THIS MYSELF AND I LOVE NIETZSCHE BUT IT'S REALLY DRY AND DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO EXTENSIVE READING LIKE TAKING NOTES AS YOU READ IS THE ONLY WAY I'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP RETENTION
I'VE LISTENED TO THE WHOLE MUSIC VERSION CAN I JOIN
REMOVED
I'M IN I REMEMBER SKIMMING IT IN COLLEGE
IM IN GREAT BOOK FOR SUMMER TO ONES EMBODIMENT
HOW WILL YOU BE GOING ABOUT READING THIS WILL IT BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PAGES EACH WEEK AND THEN A DISCUSSION AFTER EACH SECTION

I TRIED READING IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO BUT FOUND IT VERY DENSE AND LOST FOCUS SO I'D LIKE TO TRY READING IT THIS WAY TO TAKE IT IN BETTER
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD BOOK CLUB DISCUSSION CHOICE I WILL SURELY BE THERE SINGING ITS PRAISES
SO I'M NEW TO R PHILOSOPHY BUT WOULD LIKE TO JOIN THIS BOOK CLUB HOWEVER SHOULD I START WITH SOME OF THE MORE INTRO LEVEL PHILOSOPHY STUFF BEFORE I DIVE INTO NIETZSCHE JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOU GUYS THINK
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO START ZARATHUSTRA NICE
WHAT MONTH SPECIFICALLY I'M TRYING TO GET THROUGH WAR AND PEACE RIGHT NOW
SO I TRIED READING THIS ON MY OWN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND ONLY MADE IT ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE MAIN CONCEPT THAT I HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS TO MAKE MY OWN WAY IN LIFE THUS FINISHING THE BOOK WOULD BE POINTLESS OR AT LEAST THAT EVERYTHING WRITTEN SHOULD BE JUDGED HARSHLY FROM YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE KNOWING THIS IS THE BOOK REALLY WORTH FINISHING SHOULD I CONTINUE TO READ SOMETHING THAT TELLS ME TO FORGET EVERYTHING I READ ANYWAY
WAS GONNA FINISH FEAR AND TREMBLING I STARTED AGES AGO BUT I SUPPOSE ON CAN PUT THAT OFF SOME MORE FOR SOME NIETZSCHE
PERSONALLY MY FAVORITE WORK OF NIETZSCHE I'M EXCITED
JUST FINISHED IT AMAZING BUT NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH PREJUDICE TOWARDS CERTAIN THINGS HEHEHE
I GOT THE FOLIO COPY FOR CHRISTMAS AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH IT HOW DO I JOIN
CAN YA I'M OK WITH WHATEVER TRANSLATION KNOW THE WEBSITE PLEASE
I'VE ALWAYS SEEN IT WRITTEN AS THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA IS ONE MORE LESS CORRECT THAN THE OTHER
FYI THE ETERNAL CLASSICS AUDIOBOOKS VERSION IS ON PONTIFY I HAVE PREMIUM I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS REQUIRED BUT I'M EXCITED TO MAYBE FINALLY READ THIS BOOK ALL THE WAY THROUGH
PEEP SHOW
ANYONE
I AM ZATHRAS YOU MUST HAVE MET BY BROTHER ZATHRAS
I READ THIS IN MY EARLY S WITH NO PRIOR READING EXPERIENCE IN PHILOSOPHY TEXTS I DIDN'T LIKE IT HAHAHAHAH
ALSO SIRACH
CHICKEN RUN
SO FAR IT IS A GREAT BOOK I ALWAYS FANCIED MYSELF PRETTY WELL READ ON THINGS TRANSCENDENT BOOKS ON ZEN PHILOSOPHY NEW AGE ETC YET NOT TO FAR IN IT REALLY HAD ME THINKING HARD AND DEEPLY ABOUT THINGS I'M CRAWLING THROUGH IT MUCH MORE SLOWLY THEN I WOULD A GOOD FICTION STORY BUT THIS SEEMS NECESSARY WITH THE DEPTH OF THE MATERIAL
READING GENEALOGY OF MORALITY IS A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE IT LAYS DONE THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA IN A MUCH MORE COHERENT WAY
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THE BRAIN IS A CAUSAL MACHINE IN THE SENSE THAT IT GOES FROM STATE TO STATE AS A FUNCTION OF ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS FOR CRIMINAL LAW ARE ABSOLUTELY NIL FOR ONE THING ALL MAMMALS AND BIRDS HAVE CIRCUITRY FOR SELF-CONTROL WHICH IS MODIFIED THROUGH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING BEING REWARDED FOR MAKING GOOD CHOICES ESPECIALLY IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT CRIMINAL LAW IS ALSO ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND WELFARE EVEN IF WE COULD IDENTIFY CIRCUITRY UNIQUE TO SERIAL CHILD RAPISTS FOR EXAMPLE THEY COULD NOT JUST BE ALLOWED TO GO FREE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE APT TO REPEAT WERE WE TO CONCLUDE REGARDING SAY BOSTON PRIEST JOHN GEAGHAN WHO MOLESTED SOME CHILDREN IT S NOT HIS FAULT HE HAS THAT BRAIN SO LET HIM GO HOME THE RESULT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY BE VIGILANTE JUSTICE AND WHEN ROUGH JUSTICE TAKES THE PLACE OF A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ROOTED IN YEARS OF MAKING FAIR-MINDED LAW THINGS GET VERY UGLY VERY QUICKLY

I'M EXTREMELY SURPRISED THAT SOMEONE AS HIGH ESTEEMED AS PATRICIA CHURCHLAND CAN GIVE SUCH A LOUSY AND UNEDUCATED OPINION ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC NEUROSCIENCE ALREADY IS HAVING AN EFFECT ON THE LAW IF AT THE VERY LEAST AS A METHOD OF SCANNING AN INDIVIDUALS BRAIN TO DETERMINE HOW A SENTENCE WILL APPLY TO THEM I THINK BOTH SIDES OF THE DETERMINIST FREE WILL DEBATE CAN AGREE THAT INFORMATION ABOUT A AN INDIVIDUALS PROBABLY OF OFFENDING B AN INDIVIDUALS PROBABILITY OF REOFFENDING AND C PROBABILITY OF NEUROLOGICAL TREATMENT BE IT DRUGS OR THERAPY SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN THE TYPE AND LENGTH OF A SENTENCE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS A DISCONNECTION BETWEEN THE TYPICAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WHAT WE PURPORT IT TO BE FOR GENERALLY WE WILL ADMIT IT IS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT RETRIBUTION FOR WRONGDOING AND IF IT IS ABOUT RETRIBUTION FOR WRONGDOING THEN IT IS ABOUT CHOICE AND FREE WILLIAM

IT IS TYPICAL THAT A PERSON WISHING TO JUDGE ANOTHER FOR THEIR ACTIONS WILL TALK ABOUT THEM HAVING MADE A CHOICE IF WE ASSUME A DETERMINISTIC WORLD OR AT LEAST ONE THAT RENDERS FREE WILL THE PRODUCT OF THE UNIVERSE AT LARGE THEN IT IS A POINTLESS AFFIRMATION

IF WE ASSUME OURSELVES CAPABLE OF DISCERNING RIGHT AND WRONG WITH RESPECT TO WHAT SOCIETY WILL ACCEPT THEN WE SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS IN FACT ABOUT PROMOTING A CERTAIN WAY OF ACTING OR AT LEAST OF PROSCRIBING ONE IN WHICH CASE JAILING A PERSON FOR WRONGDOINGS IS A LESS EFFECTIVE WAY OF DIMINISHING RECIDIVISM THAN DOING SO WHILE REHABILITATING THEM SO THAT THEY CONFORM AND IT BECOMES MORE EFFECTIVE AND JUSTIFIABLE FOR SUCH A WORLD VIEW NOT TO SIMPLY PROTECT AND CHARGE BUT TO PREVENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
INTRODUCTION

MORAL REALISM IS THE VIEW THAT I MORAL JUDGMENTS ARE BELIEFS THAT ARE MEANT TO DESCRIBE THE WAY THINGS REALLY ARE II SOME OF THESE BELIEFS ARE TRUE AND III MORAL JUDGMENTS ARE MADE TRUE IN SOME WAY OTHER THAN BY VIRTUE OF THE ATTITUDES TAKEN TOWARDS THEIR CONTENT BY ANY ACTUAL OR IDEALIZED HUMAN AGENT IF TORTURING A CHILD IS WRONG IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF ANYONE S DISAPPROVAL OF SUCH AN ACTION IT IS NOT BECAUSE THE ACTION FALLS AFOUL OF STANDARDS THAT I ENDORSE OR RULES THAT ANY SOCIETY ACCEPTS EVEN THE DISAPPROVAL OF AN IDEAL OBSERVER SAY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ALL NONMORAL FACTS AND IS FULLY RATIONAL IS NOT WHAT MAKES AN ACTION WRONG FOR MORAL REALISTS THE ULTIMATE STANDARD S OF MORALITY ARE AS MUCH A PART OF REALITY AS THE ULTIMATE LAWS OF LOGIC OR THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICS PERHAPS GOD IF THERE IS A GOD MADE THEM UP BUT HUMAN BEINGS CERTAINLY DIDN HUMANS HAVE CREATED FOR OURSELVES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SETS OF CONVENTIONAL MORAL STANDARDS BUT THESE ARE NEVER THE FINAL WORD IN THE MORAL FLAWS AND ATTRACTIONS OF ANY CONVENTIONAL MORALITY ARE RIGHTLY MEASURED AGAINST THOSE OF A MORAL SYSTEM THAT HUMAN BEINGS DID NOT CREATE
PHILOSOPHY IS NOT PRIMARILY AN EMPIRICAL DISCIPLINE BUT AN A PRIORI ONE ITS TRUTHS ARE ORDINARILY DISCOVERABLE WHEN THEY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVELY BY APPEAL TO WHAT OUR SENSES CAN TELL US

EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE COMPRISES ALL EXPERIENCE THAT'S NOT JUST PERCEPTION BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE INTROSPECTION EVEN FOR A RATIONALIST THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT INTROSPECTION IS RATHER IMPORTANT IN PHILOSOPHY WITHOUT IT IT WOULD FOR EXAMPLE BE IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY A PRIORI BELIEFS AS SUCH

IF THE INTRACTABILITY OF DISAGREEMENT IN AN AREA IS BEST EXPLAINED BY ANTIREALIST ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT ITS STATUS THEN WE MUST BE GLOBAL PHILOSOPHICAL ANTIREALIST THE JUDGMENTS WE RENDER AND THE ARGUMENTS WE OFFER ON THEIR BEHALF MUST ALL BE SEEN EITHER AS INCAPABLE OF TRUTH AS EXPRESSIONS OF CONATIVE COMMITMENTS ONLY OR AS CLAIMS WHOSE TRUTH IS CONTINGENT ON PERSONAL OR INTERPERSONAL ENDORSEMENT BUT THAT S NOT A VERY PLAUSIBLE TAKE ON THE STATUS OF OUR PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS

THE POSITION THAT PHILOSOPHY IS THE STUDY OF CONCEPTS WHICH ARE WIDELY THOUGHT TO BE DOESN'T SEEM TOO IMPLAUSIBLE TO ME I SUPPOSE THE PERSUASIVE POWER OF THE ARGUMENT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH OF A REALIST ONE IS ABOUT PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES IN GENERAL SO IT WOULD PROBABLY TEND TO WORK BETTER ON SOMEONE WHO ALREADY IS A MORAL REALIST

TO SIMPLIFY CONSIDER A CASE IN WHICH ONE S PERCEPTUAL BELIEFS LATER FORM THE BASIS OF A MEMORIAL BELIEF I SAW AND REMEMBER TALKING TO MY HATED NEMESIS SMITH THE MOMENT BEFORE HE MADE THAT FATAL MISSTEP THAT NO ONE ELSE WITNESSED I TRY TO CONVINCE OTHERS OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND AM MET WITH DISBELIEF

NOT A VERY APPROPRIATE ANALOGY I THINK THE MORE DISAGREEMENT THERE IS ON A MORAL ISSUE THE FEWER PEOPLE CAN POSSIBLY HAVE EPISTEMIC ACCESS TO THE RELEVANT MORAL FACTS IF THOSE EXIST AND THE LESS LIKELY IT IS THAT ONESELF IS AMONG THEM THE SAME IS TRUE OF DISAGREEMENT ABOUT PERCEPTIONS THE LATTER IS JUST MUCH RARER BUT IN THIS EXAMPLE THE DOUBT SEEMS LESS ABOUT THE CORRECTNESS OF A PERCEPTION OR MEMORY PRESUMABLY THE OTHERS CORRECTLY BELIEVE THEY HAVE NEITHER OF THOSE ABOUT THE INCIDENT IN QUESTION THAN THAT OF A CLAIM ABOUT IT

EPISTEMIC FACTS CONCERN WHAT WE OUGHT TO BELIEVE PROVIDED THAT OUR BELIEFS ARE AIMED AT THE TRUTH

SO THEY ARE ABOUT WHAT ACTIONS BRING ABOUT STATES OF AFFAIRS WHERE ONE'S BELIEFS ARE TRUE THAT SEEMS PRETTY DESCRIPTIVE TO ME MORAL FACTS IN CONTRAST ARE OFTEN BELIEVED TO BE ABOUT WHAT ONE OUGHT TO DO INDEPENDENTLY OF ONE'S GOALS BUT IF THEY'RE NOT THEY ARE AT THE VERY LEAST NOT PURELY NORMATIVE
HM THIS PAPER

MORAL

WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT NONNATURALISM IS A MISNOMER SINCE HE REFUSES TO METAPHYSICALLY COMMIT TO ANYTHING ELSE THAN NATURALISM PAGE
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT ETHICAL QUESTIONS HAVE AN OBJECTIVE TRUTH WE FIRST NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OBJECTIVE TRUTH IS IE WE NEED SOME KIND OF THEORY OF TRUTH AND A BIT OF SETUP BEFORE WE GET TO

I FAVOR BROADLY WHAT'S CALLED A CORRESPONDENCE THEORY OF TRUTH A STATEMENT IS TRUE IF IT MAPS TO SOME KIND OF REALITY SOMETHING MIND INDEPENDENT THAT IS OUT THERE NOT IN OUR HEADS

I AM BROADLY A FAN OF EMPIRICISM BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I DON'T THINK THAT OUR MINDS RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION THAT ISN'T SENSORY DATA IF YOU DRAW A CIRCLE AROUND THE MIND SO TO SPEAK THE ONLY THING GOING INTO THIS CIRCLE IS SENSE DATA ARGUMENTS FROM INNATE KNOWLEDGE OR INSTINCT AREN'T CONVINCING TO ME IF THERE'S ANY INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY INSIDE THE CIRCLE RIGHT WHEN WE'RE BORN IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF EVOLUTION A PROCESS THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE PHYSICAL EMPIRICAL WORLD

LET'S SKIP THE METAPHYSICAL SKEPTICISM AND ASSUME THAT A PHYSICAL WORLD EXISTS AND THAT IT EXISTS IN MORE OR LESS THE FORM THAT WE THINK IT EXISTS AS IF THIS IS SO THEN ALL OF OUR SENSE DATA COMES FROM THIS PHYSICAL WORLD AND BY MY EARLIER PREMISE OF EMPIRICISM ALL OF OUR KNOWLEDGE ULTIMATELY COMES FROM SENSE DATA OR BY FORMING NOMINAL ABSTRACTIONS ON TOP OF THE SENSE DATA OBJECTS EXIST IN OUR MIND ONLY THEY ARE NOMINAL ENTITIES ONLY NOT REAL OBJECTS ARE MERELY CHUNKS OF SENSE DATA THEY ARE PATTERN RECOGNITION WELL EMPIRICISM DOESN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTS BEING REAL AND EXISTING IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD BUT WHETHER THEY ARE OR NOT WE'LL NEVER KNOW BECAUSE WE CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CHUNK OF SENSE DATA COMING FROM A TRUE METAPHYSICAL OBJECT OR FROM SIMPLY AN ARRANGEMENT OF ATOMS THAT ONCE WE DETECT THIS ARRANGEMENT OF ATOMS WITH SENSE DATA WE CONCEIVE OF IT AS AN OBJECT IN OUR MIND

QUICKLY MOVING ON MY PREVIOUSLY STATED COMMITMENTS LEAD ME TO ADOPT A SORT OF EMPIRICISM WITH REGARDS TO PHILOSOPHY OF MATHEMATICS MATH IS MANIPULATING CONCEPTS AND OBJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN OUR HEAD MATH CAN ULTIMATELY BE BROKEN DOWN INTO AXIOMS IF YOU EXAMINE THOSE CONCEPTS THAT YOU'RE MANIPULATING REALLY CLOSELY ULTIMATELY MATHEMATICAL AXIOMS AND CONCEPTS ARE A VERY HIGH LEVEL ABSTRACTION ON OUR SENSE DATA WELL THEY USUALLY ARE GRANTED WE CAN JUST TOTALLY MAKE UP MATHEMATICAL AXIOMS THAT HAVE NO BASIS IN OUR SENSE DATA BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO THIS IF YOU DO THEN THAT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM MANIPULATING THE CONCEPT ON YOUR HEAD IT JUST DOESN'T REPRESENT THE REAL WORLD IN ANY FORM OR FASHION MOST MATHEMATICAL AXIOMS DO REPRESENT AND ULTIMATELY DERIVE FROM THE REAL WORLD IN SOME FORM FOR EXAMPLE 2D SPHERICAL GEOMETRY CORRELATES TO REALITY IF YOU'RE TRYING TO TESSELATE A SOCCER BALL OR NAVIGATE OVER A MOSTLY SPHERICAL PLANET BUT WON'T APPLY TO A PIECE OF PAPER BUT THE POINT IS IT DOES MAP TO AT LEAST SOME PARTS OF REALITY AXIOMS THAT HAVE CORRESPONDENCE TO AT LEAST SOME PART OF REALITY CAN BE SAID TO DERIVE OR CORRESPOND TO REALITY BUT AGAIN TO REITERATE EVEN IF YOU'VE GOT SOME MATHEMATICAL SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T MAP TO ANY PART OF REALITY YOU CAN STILL MANIPULATE IT IN YOUR HEAD AND COME UP WITH THEOREMS AND WHAT NOT

THAT PRETTY MUCH CONCLUDES MY SETUP PHASE OF MY ARGUMENT ALL IN ALL I DON'T THINK MY PREMISES CORRESPONDENCE THEORY AND EMPIRICISM ARE TOO CONTROVERSIAL OK NOT EVERYONE AGREES WITH THEM BUT PLENTY OF PHILOSOPHERS DO I THINK THOSE POSITIONS ARE COMMON ENOUGH THAT IT'S REASONABLE FOR ME TO GO OVER THEM AS BRIEFLY AS I DID AND NOT GO INTO THEM ANY FURTHER AND ASK ANYONE READING WHO DISAGREES WITH THOSE THINGS TO AT LEAST JUST ASSUME IT FOR THE SAKE OF DISCUSSION FOR NOW

FINALLY GETTING TO ETHICS NOW THAT THE OTHER STUFF IS SET UP ETHICS IS VERY SIMILAR TO MATHEMATICS YOU'VE GOT CONCEPTS OF RIGHT AND WRONG AND YOU MANIPULATE THEM IN YOUR HEAD COME UP WITH THEOREMS AND IT ALL HAS MEANING IT'S NOT SIMPLY NONSENSE HOWEVER WHERE ETHICS DIFFERS FROM MATH IS THAT I DON'T SEE HOW ETHICAL AXIOMS DERIVE FROM OR CORRESPOND TO THE REAL WORLD IN BOTH MATH AND ETHICS YOU CAN MAKE A STATEMENT AND PROVE IT BASED ON A SET OF AXIOMS IN MATH YOU CAN FURTHER SHOW THAT THE AXIOMS ARE EMPIRICALLY JUSTIFIED IN A SENSE THAT THE AXIOMS HAVE THEIR BASIS IN THE REAL WORLD THAT THE AXIOMS ARE VERY HIGH LEVEL ABSTRACTIONS OF SENSE DATA THAT BY COMMON ASSUMPTION COMES FROM OBJECTIVE REALITY BUT WHERE DO ETHICAL AXIOMS COME FROM

ETHICAL SAY THAT MORAL TRUTH IS NOT NATURAL AND IT ISN'T EMPIRICAL HAVE PLENTY OF ARGUMENTS FOR THIS I WON'T GET INTO IT GE MOORE HAD A FAMOUS ONE THE AUTHOR OF THE OP CLAIMS TO BE A IS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY MY EARLIER PREMISE OF EMPIRICISM THAT THE ONLY INFORMATION WE RECEIVE IS THROUGH SENSE DATA THAT MEANS THERE ARE NO MORAL TRUTHS IF MORAL TRUTHS ARE NOT NATURALISTIC

IT'S REALLY JUST A MATTER OF A MISSING EPISTEMIC LINK IF MORAL TRUTHS CAN'T BE TOUCHED SO TO SPEAK WITH EMPIRICISM AND SENSE DATA OF ANY KIND THEN WHAT CAN YOU TOUCH THEM WITH FAITH FAITH IN SOME SORT OF PLATONIC REALM OF GOOD AND BAD FAITH IN GOD

UNTIL I SEE THIS EPISTEMIC LINK I REMAIN A MORAL THAT MEANS YOU CAN ASSERT OR ASSUME MORAL AXIOMS FOR THE SAKE OF DISCUSSION YOU CAN ARGUE ABOUT ETHICS IF ALL PARTIES SHARE ETHICAL AXIOMS AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TRYING TO FIND THE THEOREMS YOU AND EVERYONE CAN PROCLAIM ALLEGIANCE TO SOME SET OF ETHICAL AXIOMS OR THE OTHER BUT ULTIMATELY THE AXIOMS JUST DON'T MAP THEY JUST DON'T MAP TO THE REAL WORLD AND SO THERE'S NO ACTUAL TRUTH TO THE MORAL AXIOMS THEMSELVES

CENTRAL CLAIM WITHIN A CENTRAL ARGUMENT IS JUST SILLY TO ME IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY HE'S SAYING THAT ETHICS IS A SPECIE OF PHILOSOPHY AND PHILOSOPHY SEEKS THE TRUTH THEREFORE ETHICS SEEKS THE TRUTH THEREFORE THERE MUST BE SOME TRUTH OF THE MATTER IN ETHICS

OK WELL GOING BY HIS DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPHY AN ANTI REALIST LIKE ME COULD JUST SAY THAT HIS PREMISE IS WRONG IE ETHICS IS TECHNICALLY SPEAKING NOT ACTUALLY A SPECIE OF PHILOSOPHY ACCORDING TO HIS DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPHY AND NOW WE'RE JUST PLAYING AROUND WITH SEMANTICS WHICH ISN'T THAT INTERESTING ALL IN ALL I'VE READ BETTER DEFENSES OF OR MORAL REALISM AS A WHOLE ALTHOUGH CLEARLY I DON'T FIND ANY OF IT CONVINCING
ETHICS IS A SPECIES OF INQUIRY PHILOSOPHY IS ITS
GENUS
2 A SPECIES INHERITS THE ESSENTIAL TRAITS OF ITS GENUS
ONE ESSENTIAL TRAIT OF PHILOSOPHY IS THE REALISTIC
STATUS OF ITS TRUTHS
THEREFORE MORAL REALISM IS TRUE

DOES NOT FOLLOW FROM 2 THOUGH ALL 2 AND PUT TOGETHER CAN FORCE AS A CONCLUSION IS ETHICAL TRUTHS EXIST BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS OF ETHICS IS WHETHER MORAL REALISM IS VALID THE TRUE ANSWER TO THAT MIGHT BE NO IT IS NOT

I HAVE SOME OTHER ISSUES WITH THE POINTS HE MAKES BUT I THINK THIS IS THE CLEAREST POINT OF CRITICISM THAT COMES TO MIND
I LOCATE THE CENTRAL CLAIM WITHIN A CENTRAL ARGUMENT HERE IT IS

ETHICS IS A SPECIES OF INQUIRY PHILOSOPHY IS ITS GENUS

2 A SPECIES INHERITS THE ESSENTIAL TRAITS OF ITS GENUS

ONE ESSENTIAL TRAIT OF PHILOSOPHY IS THE REALISTIC STATUS OF ITS TRUTHS

THEREFORE MORAL REALISM IS TRUE

BOTH PREMISE AND 2 STRIKE ME AS EXTREMELY BLAU SIBLE SO PLAUSIBLE IN FACT THAT I WILL PROCEED HERE BY ASSUMING RATHER THAN ARGUING FOR THEIR TRUTH IF ONE IS WILLING TO MAKE THESE CONCESSIONS THEN ALL THE ATTENTION MUST FOCUS ON PREMISE

WHY WOULD TAXONOMY APPLY TO PHILOSOPHY
REMOVED
DEFINE OMNIPOTENCE

SERIOUSLY IF YOU MEAN ABLE TO BRING ABOUT LITERALLY ANY OUTCOME INCLUDING A LOGICAL CONTRADICTION THEN YOU HAVE A VERY REAL POINT BUT I'D SUGGEST A SOMEWHAT USELESS ONE

YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE WORD DEFINED IN THAT WAY CAUSES ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE WHEN YOU TRY TO APPLY IT TO ANYTHING

BUT THEN YOU GO ON TO TALK ABOUT GOD AS THOUGH OMNIPOTENCE IN THIS DEFINITION WERE A RECOGNISED CHARACTERISTIC OF GOD AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE CERTAINLY IF YOU ARE TRYING TO APPLY THIS TO A CHRISTIAN UNDERSTANDING OF GOD YOUR POINT IS IRRELEVANT BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD OMNIPOTENCE THE CHRISTIAN DEFINITION OF THE WORD ARISING FROM AND EXTENDING HOW IT WAS USED IN ROMAN TIMES IS HAVING THE POWER TO DO WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE CF AQUINAS SUMMA THEOLOGIC Q ART A LOGICAL CONTRADICTION IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE

IS A GOD POSITED TO HAVE THAT SORT OF OMNIPOTENCE POSSIBLE I THINK PROBABLY NOT BUT THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER ALL THAT MUCH TO ME BECAUSE AS A CATHOLIC THAT'S NOT PART OF THE GOD I KNOW IT MAY GIVE ME AN ARGUMENT IN DEBATE WITH SOME FORMS OF ISLAM BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL

WHAT IS PART OF THE GOD I KNOW IS REASON AND TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT SAYING THAT HUMAN REASONING IS NECESSARILY PERFECT OR NECESSARILY A PERFECT REFLECTION OF GOD'S REASON BUT WE CAN UNDERSTAND A FAIR AMOUNT OF REASON AND LOGIC AND USE THAT REASON AND LOGIC TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF GOD IN FACT I WOULD SAY THAT LOGIC AND REASON WORK PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY ARE ASPECTS OF HOW GOD IS

FOR THOSE INTERESTED I WOULD POINT TO SCRIPTURAL EVIDENCE FOR THIS READ JOHN CHAPTER BEARING IN MIND THE CLOSE LINGUISTIC AND THEN PHILOSOPHICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN LOGOS THE WORD AND LOGIC NOT PART OF THIS ARGUMENT AS SUCH SO PARENTHESIZED HERE

SO LOGIC IS NOT A CREATION OF GOD IT IS AN EXPRESSION OF GOD LOGIC IS NOT AN EXTERNAL LIMITATION UPON GOD'S POWER IT IS A PROPERTY OF GOD ACTING AGAINST LOGIC IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD NOT BECAUSE THAT IS A LIMITATION IMPOSED UPON GOD BUT BECAUSE GOD SIMPLY DOES NOT ACT THAT WAY IF HE DID HE WOULD NOT BE GOD
IF HE CAN'T NOT DO SOMETHING THEN HE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING

I THINK THIS IS THE SAME CATEGORICAL MISTAKE THAT PLAGUES THE ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT LOOK UP PARMENIDES NOT ISN'T A MODALITY IT'S NOT EVEN NOT A MODALITY IT JUST ISN'T THERE THE BETTER QUESTION IS CAN GOD CREATE A ROCK THAT IS SO HEAVY THAT HE CANNOT LIFT IT EITHER WAY POSING THIS QUESTION MAKES GOD EITHER HE CAN'T CREATE IT OR HE CAN'T LIFT IT IT'S A PARADOX

BUT EVEN THE PARADOX ASSUMES THE CONFINEMENT OF OMNIPOTENCE WITHIN LOGIC AS YOU SAY IT'S ONLY A LOGICAL PARADOX A PARADOX IN AS FAR AS LOGIC IS CONCERNED MAYBE GOD COULD MAKE A ROCK THAT WAS SO HEAVY HE COULDN'T LIFT IT BUT HE COULD STILL LIFT IT BECAUSE TERTIUM CATUR WHEN OMNIPOTENCE

SO ON THE SURFACE IT'S EXACTLY AS YOU SAY EITHER OMNIPOTENCE IS CONFINED BY LOGIC OR OMNIPOTENCE IS NOT CONFINED BY LOGIC THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING

THE DEEPER PROBLEM HOWEVER LIES WITH THE CONCEPT OF OMNIPOTENCE ITSELF I THINK SINCE IT IS ILLOGICAL TO IT'S CORE DEFYING EVEN THE MOST BASIC LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS BUT THEN AGAIN WHAT IF IT CAN RIGHT
OR OMNIPOTENCE IS NOT CONFINED BY LOGIC AND GOD CREATED MORAL AMBIGUITY AND EVIL DESPITE BEING CAPABLE CREATING OTHERWISE

DO YOU MEAN GOD COULDN'T HAVE CREATED MORAL AMBIGUITY AND EVIL IF HE WAS CONFINED TO LOGIC BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD WORK UNLESS YOU'RE EQUATING OMNIPOTENCE AND BENEVOLENCE EVEN WHEN WE'D ALL AGREE THAT GOD IN AS FAR AS HE EXISTS WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS
OMNIPOTENT THE MOST BASIC DEFINITION OF IT IS ALL POWERFUL NO CONSTRAINTS NOT EVEN LOGIC IF OMNIPOTENCE IS NOT PRESUMED I SEE NO WAY OF LOGICALLY KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ENTITY MAKING ASSERTING IT'S POSSIBLE EXISTENCE A NULL CONCEPT

I SEE NO WAY OF REFUTING THE CONCEPT THAT SUCH AN ENTITY COULD EXIST LIKEWISE NO WAY TO PROVE IT DOES

THIS IS THE LOGICAL DEFINITION I USE FOR AGNOSTICISM

WELL PUT AND I AGREE COMPLETELY AN OMNISCIENT AND OMNIPOTENT GOD ADMITTEDLY A REDUNDANT STATEMENT SINCE GOD MUST BE BOTH WOULD LOGICALLY DISALLOW HUMAN FREEDOM
TO ADD TO YOUR POINT THE ABRAHAMIC POSITION IS FURTHER INCOMPATIBLE WITH FREEDOM SINCE NOT ONLY ARE YOUR ACTIONS AND THOUGHTS POLICED IN LIFE BUT EVEN DEATH CANNOT GRANT YOU FREEDOM SINCE YOU ARE ETERNALLY JUDGED AND SENTENCED IN THE AFTERLIFE EVEN IN THE MOST TORTUROUS UNFREE REGIMES ANYONE CAN AT LEAST DIE TO ESCAPE THE HORRORS OF SAY SOVIET UNION THE POPULAR CONCEPTION OF GOD BEING YOUR INESCAPABLE BIG BROTHER ALLOWS YOU NO SUCH LIBERTY THE TENTH COMMANDMENT DARES TO GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT STEALING THEN YOU WILL BE CONDEMNED
GOD CAN DO ANYTHING IT'S NOT HIM THAT IS CONFINED BY LOGIC IT'S THE MATERIAL REALIZATIONS OF HIS ACTIONS THAT ARE CONFINED BY LOGIC THAT'S WHY THE STONE EXAMPLE FAILS THERE IS NO STONE THAT GOD COULD CREATE AND NOT LIFT NOT BECAUSE GOD IS INHERENTLY LIMITED BUT BECAUSE THE STONE IS INHERENTLY LIMITED AND STONES ARE NOT IMMATERIAL THEY ARE MATERIAL THINGS BEHOLDEN TO THE LAWS OF LOGIC AND NATURE
FIRST NOTHING CAN TRANSCEND THE CONFINES OF LOGIC FOR INSTANCE IF ONE ASSERTS AN ASSERTION AND ITS NEGATION AT THE SAME TIME ONE WOULD BE CONTRADICTING ONESELF NOT ASSERTING TWO STATEMENTS THAT HE CAN BELIEVE IN AT ONCE BUT DISAGREEING WITH ONESELF I HOPE THAT ILLUSTRATES WHY CONTRADICTIONS CANNOT EXIST A GOD THAT TRANSCENDS LOGIC WOULD ALLOW FOR SUCH CONTRADICTIONS THEREFORE A GOD THAT TRANSCENDS LOGIC CANNOT EXIST

SECOND YOU POSITED THAT LOGIC AND REASON CONFINE A GOD THAT TRANSCENDS LOGIC AND REASON WHICH IS A CONTRADICTION I KNOW THAT THIS CONTRADICTION DOESN'T MATTER IN A UNIVERSE THAT ALLOWS FOR CONTRADICTIONS FOR IN SUCH A UNIVERSE THE POSITION THAT LOGIC AND REASON DO NOT CONFINE A GOD THAT TRANSCENDS LOGIC AND REASON HOLDS EQUALLY TRUE BUT YOU SEEM TO BE TRYING TO USE LOGIC AND REASON TO MAKE THIS ARGUMENT THEREFORE ASSUMING WE EXIST IN A UNIVERSE IN WHICH NOTHING TRANSCENDS LOGIC AND REASON

THIRD I DON'T AGREE WITH YOUR POSITION THAT EVIL CAN EXIST WITHOUT FREE WILL WHICH YOU IMPLY TWICE DEVILITY AND GOODNESS IMPLY CHOICE FOR EXAMPLE A ROCK THAT WAS ACCIDENTALLY KICKED ONTO SOMEONE'S HEAD WAS NOT BEING EVIL RATHER THE PERSON WHO KICKED IT WAS RECKLESS AGAIN DEVILITY ONLY APPLIES TO ENTITIES WITH FREE WILLIAM

THE ENTIRETY OF ALL IS A SINGLE BEGINNINGLESS MOTION WITHIN ITSELF AKA REALITY IS ABSOLUTELY FATE DRIVEN GOD SIMPLY IS AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT ISN'T GOD SO IT WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE TO SAY GOD IS OMNISCIENT BUT NEVER GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT

WHAT IS THIS
I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS GUY HIS POINTS ON KANT WERE VERY ENLIGHTENING TO ME BACK WHEN I FIRST WATCHED HIM WHICH SAYS ALOT
CAME TO WATCH A CRASH AND BURN VIDEO WITH WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED DISAPPOINTED THAT MARX DIDN'T MAKE IT IN THERE BUT NOW I'VE GOT A WHOLE NEW PHILOSOPHER TO READ UP ON
COULD YOU TO R CRITICALTHEORY
IN SOME SENSE ACCELERATIONISM IS MORE DETERMINIST THAN MARX THAT IS THE CONTRADICTIONS OF CAPITALISM WILL UNFOLD AND DESTROY CAPITAL HOWEVER WE NEED TO HELP CAPITAL DO THIS THE CONTRADICTIONS AREN'T DESTROYING CAPITALISM FAST ENOUGH SO LET US INTERVENE TO HELP IS THIS NOT REALLY A QUITE OLD FORMULATION WHAT'S NEW IS SEEING THAT INTERVENTION NOT AGAINST CAPITAL TO LIMIT IT'S EXPLOITATION OF WORKERS TRANSFORMATION OF THE WORK PROCESS ETC BUT FOR IT IF CAPITAL IS ULTIMATELY AGAINST ITSELF THEN BEING FOR THAT MAKES SOME SENSE IF CAPITAL IN HELPING ITSELF ACTUALLY DESTROYS ITSELF THEN PERHAPS WE SHOULD HELP AND WORK WITH CAPITAL AS WELL TO ACCELERATE THAT DESTRUCTION THE DESIRE TO FIND SOME POTENCY AND LOGIC OF ACTION IN A GROUND THAT DOESN'T HOLD ANY IS SELF-EVIDENT WHEN WE CAN NO LONGER ACT REVOLUTIONARY OR TRANSFORMATIVELY ON THE SIDE OF WORKERS OR A CLASS WE CAN BARELY SEE THEN OUR NEED FOR ACTION AS REVOLUTIONARIES AND RADICALS MUST BE FOUND ELSEWHERE AND WHAT IS ELSEWHERE BUT CAPITAL AS THE WORKING-CLASS BEGINS TO LOOSE ITSELF CAPITAL CONSUMES THE HORIZON WE ARE ALREADY IN A SOCIETY WHERE TO ACT IS NEARLY ALWAYS TO HELP CAPITAL IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THINK OF SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING SO TO DO SO ACTIVELY WITH A LOGIC AND PLATFORM SEEMS A RARE HONESTY AND CLARITY NEVERTHELESS WHAT CAN WE ACTUALLY DO WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO PROPOSE WE UNLEASH THE FORCES OF CAPITAL
THANKS FOR THIS I'VE TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO LOCATE AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF PHIL OF MYTH AND PHIL OF RELIGION ANY POINTERS
ABSTRACT

THE CONTENTION OF THIS ARTICLE IS THAT PARENTS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN
BUT FOR REASONS THAT ARE NOT TYPICALLY OFFERED I ARGUE THAT THIS OBLIGATION CAN BE UNFAIR
TO PARENTS BUT NOT UNJUST I DO NOT PROVIDE AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT OUR SPECIFIC OBLIGATIONS ARE
TO OUR CHILDREN RATHER I FOCUS ON PROVIDING A JUSTIFICATION FOR ANY OBLIGATION TO CARE FOR
THEM AT ALL MY ARGUMENT TURNS ON PROVIDING AN EXTERNAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PARENT CHILD
RELATIONSHIP IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THAT PARENTS ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION AMONG ADULTS IN
THEIR ABILITY TO HELP AND HARM THEIR OWN CHILDREN GIVEN THAT CHILDREN ARE DESERVING OF
MORAL REGARD I CONCLUDE THAT PARENTS ARE OBLIGATED IN A WAY THAT IS OFTEN UNFAIR TO
PROVIDE THIS CARE I END BY CONSIDERING IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIAL POLICY

WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK

I THINK THIS IS THE BEST ENTRY TO PHILOSOPHY OUT THERE HE'S NOT DOING SOME SECONDARY SOURCE MATERIAL BUT JUST TAKING THE TEXT AND BREAKING IT DOWN DIRECTLY I JUST ADORE THE WAY HOW J B PETERSON MANAGES TO ANALYZE N'S IDEAS IN SIMPLE YET SO PROFOUND MANNER

HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYTHING THE GUY PUTS UP IN HIS CHANNEL IT'S JUST MILD-BLOWING
DELETED
JUST TAKE A SIP OF WATER

DESIRES WERE IN CONFLICT

GREAT VIDEO
I ATTEMPTED TO READ BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL SOME YEARS AGO HONESTLY I WAS LOST THIS VIDEO MAKES ME WANT TO TRY AGAIN DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MORE NARRATIVES TO GO ALONG WITH THE WORK OR PERHAPS A FORUM SECONDARY WORK ETC THAT WOULD MAKE BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL MORE ACCESSIBLE AND ENGAGING
THE CHAPTER IN QUESTION SIXTH PARAGRAPH

REFERENCE ARCHIVE NIETZSCHE
I FEEL SO STUPID I THOUGHT THIS VIDEO WAS JUST GOING TO BE MINUTES OF A GUY READING THE SAME PARAGRAPH OVER AND OVER AND OVER
I'D LOVE TO DIVE INTO MORE ABOUT THE WILL TO POWER THAT HE GOES INTO NEAR THE END HAVING MANY IMPULSES INSIDE AS CYCLOPES CLAMBERING TO RESHAPE THE WORLD IN THEIR OWN IMAGE ETC CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND SOMETHING THAT BRINGS TOGETHER DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES ON THIS OR A PROMINENT PHILOSOPHER WHO'S INTO THIS
JORDAN PRETTY COOL HE IS A JUNGIAN PSYCHOLOGIST SO HIS INTEREST IN NIETZSCHE IS DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY THE FACT THAT NIETZSCHE WAS A BIG INFLUENCE ON JUNG IF YOU ENJOY THIS TALK YOU WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY READING JUNG TOO
REMOVED

I HAVE A COURSE ON NIETZSCHE THIS SEMESTER I HAD NO CLUE WHAT WHO IT WAS UNTIL NOW THANKS REDDIN
THIS DEMONSTRATES THAT NIETZSCHE IS A RORSCHACH TESTAMENT

IT MAY BE NONSENSE BUT IT EVOKES AND DISPLAYS THE MINDSET OF THE READER PETERSON SAID PRECIOUS LITTLE ABOUT N AND A LOT ABOUT HIS OWN PHILOSOPHY IN THE MINUTES

AS FAR AS N HAVING AN IQ OF A BILLION I WOULD EXPECT SUCH A TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORMULATE HIS PHILOSOPHY IN A WAY INSTEAD OF JUST AS A OF APHORISMS AND EMOTIONAL EJACULATIONS

AS FOR THE UNCONSCIOUS AT THE BASE OF N'S OWN PHILOSOPHY IT APPEARS TO BE AN ENVY OF AN IDEALIZED NOBILITY OF WHICH HE NEVER WAS AND NEVER COULD BE A MEMBER
I RECOMMEND WATCHING THIS IN SPEED HE SPEAKS EXTREMELY SLOW WITH LONG GAPS
DO I REALLY HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW DEHUMANIZING A GENDER ON FANTASIES IS A DETRIMENT TO US HARMONIZING AND UNITING AS A SPECIES TO INFLICT PAIN AND TORTURE ON ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL BASED ON THE NOTIONS AND SUPPOSED LAWS OF SUPERNATURAL STORIES
I HAVE TO MAKE A CASE FOR THAT
THE GUY IS ALMOST AS LONG-WINDED AS NIETZSCHE WHY HAS HE NOT ONCE MENTIONED RESSENTIMENT WHICH BASICALLY DESCRIBES THE ENTIRE CRITIQUE PRESENTED IN THIS PARAGRAPH I ALSO FIND IT DIFFICULT TAKING PEOPLE SERIOUSLY WHO CLAIM GENIUS WAS BEYOND COMPREHENSION I MEAN COME ON
SO SAY HE NEVER TOOK ANOTHER SIP OF WATER
HE IS UNDER ATTACK FROM THE REGRESSIVE LEFT AND MIGHT LOSE FUNDING TO DO HIS RESEARCH

PLEASE SUPPORT HIM ON PATRON IF YOU FOUND HIS VIDEOS USEFUL
USER U
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYONE OF OUR FIRST COMMENTING RULE

READ THE POST BEFORE YOU REPLY

READ THE POSTED CONTENT UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY THE PHILOSOPHICAL ARGUMENTS GIVEN AND RESPOND TO THESE SUBSTANTIVELY IF YOU HAVE UNRELATED THOUGHTS OR DON'T WISH TO READ THE CONTENT PLEASE POST YOUR OWN THREAD OR SIMPLY REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING COMMENTS WHICH ARE CLEARLY NOT IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE POSTED CONTENT MAY BE REMOVED

THIS SUB IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF TANGENTIAL ANECDOTES OR DANK MEMES EXPECT COMMENT THREADS THAT BREAK OUR RULES TO BE REMOVED
BUT WE DO NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE WHITE MALES HAVE THE POWER TO HURT US IN VARIOUS WAYS BUT BECAUSE REMEMBER THEY TOO ARE HUMAN BEINGS WHO JUST BY BEING HUMAN DESERVE TO BE HEALED TO BE ABLE TO LIVE AND LOVE AS HEALTHY WHOLE SOULS BUT BEYOND THIS IF WE DON T EMBRACE MERCY WE RISK OUR OWN SOULS AND CANNIBALIZE ONE ANOTHER

SO WHERE IS THE WHITE MALE SOCIAL JUSTICE CLERIC MOVEMENT AS A FEMALE WITH A TECHNOLOGY CAREER PLEASE SEND HELP IF WHITE MALE RAGE HAS A ORIGIN SOCIETY WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE DRASTICALLY TO CHANGE IT A QUESTION I HAVE THEN FROM AN EXAMPLE IN YOUR ARTICLE IS IF THE BROCK TURNER SENTENCE IS TO BE CONSIDERED MERCIFUL IN NATURE HOW DOES IT ACTUALLY CHANGE BROCK VALUES IF THOSE VALUES COME FROM YIELDING TO PRESSURES MANY OF THEM SOCIAL THAT LIE DEEP IN THE FABRIC OF HUMAN LIFE BEFORE A CHILD IS CAPABLE OF THE CRITICAL EXERCISE OF REASON HE OR SHE HAS INTERNALIZED A SOCIALLY TAUGHT SCHEME OF VALUES
SUMMARY IS KNOWLEDGE HUMANLY POSSIBLE IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO JENNIFER NAGEL UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LOOKS AT SKEPTICAL ARGUMENTS STARTING WITH ANCIENT GREEK AND CHINESE PHILOSOPHY AND MOVING FORWARD INTO CONTEMPORARY SCENARIOS WE LL REVIEW A VARIETY OF REASONS TO WORRY THAT KNOWLEDGE MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE AND WE LL EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GLOBAL AND LOCAL FORMS OF SKEPTICISM

THE FIELD OF EPISTEMOLOGY HAS MOSTLY BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE TRADITIONAL DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH RELATES A MENTAL STATE TO AN OBJECTIVE TRUTH HOWEVER THE SKEPTICAL VIEW THAT KNOWLEDGE IS IMPOSSIBLE IS SO ENTICING BECAUSE THAT DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE INCLUDES A TAUTOLOGY THAT THERE IS ALREADY KNOWLEDGE OF OBJECTIVE TRUTH AVAILABLE WITH WHICH TO COMPARE THAT MENTAL STATE BEFORE ONE CAN JUDGE WHETHER KNOWLEDGE IS KNOWLEDGE IN SHORT YOU CANNOT KNOW ANYTHING UNLESS SOMETHING ALREADY KNOWS WHETHER THAT SOMETHING EXISTS IS ANOTHER PIECE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT CANNOT BE KNOWN UNLESS SOMETHING ELSE KNOWS IT AND SO ON

AT THE END OF THIS SERIES IS VIRTUE EPISTEMOLOGY WHICH TO ME APPEARS TO LOOP BACK TOWARDS SKEPTICISM I AM ASSERTING THIS BECAUSE IN VIRTUE EPISTEMOLOGY THE TRADITIONAL DEFINITION OF KNOWLEDGE SEEMS TO BE ABANDONED IN FAVOUR OF REDEFINITION AS INTELLECTUAL VIRTUE IN THE TREATMENT OF INPUTS TO ME THIS COULD BE A REASONABLE AND PRACTICAL RESOLUTION TO PYRRHONIC SKEPTICISM BECAUSE ONE IS ABLE TO WITHHOLD FINAL JUDGEMENT ON WHETHER THE MODELS IN ONE'S MIND IS REAL KNOWLEDGE WHILE BEING ABLE TO DEVELOP A SET OF BELIEFS WORKING KNOWLEDGE THAT IS CONTINGENT ON THE RELIABILITY OF ONE'S SENSES ABILITY OF RATIONALISATION AND INTELLECTUAL HONESTY
I'M NOT SURE WHAT EXACTLY THE CONCERN IS HERE IF WE HAVE SYMMETRIC MODUS PONENT MODUS POLLENS ARGUMENTS THERE ARE A FEW PROBLEMS THAT COULD OCCUR

WE MAY BE MISLED IF WE ONLY CONSIDER ONE IN ISOLATION I EAST BY FAILING TO CONSIDER THE REASONS THAT ULTIMATELY COUNT AGAINST OUR PREMISES
SIMILARLY IF THE MT IS GIVEN AS A COUNTER TO THE MP OR VICE VERSA THE ORIGINAL ARGUER MAY POSSIBLY RIGHTLY COMPLAIN THAT THEIR ARGUMENT IS JUST BEING IGNORED

BUT THESE ARE MORE CONTEXTUAL DIALECTICAL ISSUES THAN ISSUES WITH THE PATTERN OF REASONING ITSELF SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE BUILDING AN ARGUMENT ON THE STRENGTH OF INTUITIONS BUT OTHER INTUITIONS CONFLICT WITH OURS IT'S QUITE CORRECT TO DO THE MP MT SHIFT EAST G

IT SEEMS INTUITIVE THAT WE HAVE A DUTY TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN WHERE THEY WILL SUFFER BUT NO EQUIVALIANT DUTY TO HAVE CHILDREN WHERE THEY WILL BE HAPPY CHILDREN WILL INEVITABLY SUFFER AT LEAST A LITTLE AND THEIR HAPPINESS DOESN'T MATTER IN THIS CONTEXT THEREFORE WE ARE DUTY-BOUND TO NEVER HAVE CHILDREN
2 IT SEEMS INTUITIVE THAT THERE CANNOT BE A DUTY TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN AS THIS IS A BASIC RIGHT HAVING CHILDREN LEADS TO GOOD THINGS IN THE WORLD AND HAVING CHILDREN IS NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR THE SPECIES TO CONTINUE THEREFORE THE INTUITION ABOUT OUR DUTY IN IS WRONG

IT IS NOT SELF EVIDENT THAT WE ARE MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS THAT MURDER IS WRONG OR THAT THERE IS A GOD THESE CLAIMS REQUIRE DEFENDING BY MEANS OF EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENTS



I DO THINK IT IS SELF EVIDENT THAT I HAVE HANDS

YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MOORMAN SHIFTS IN PRINCIPLE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MOORMAN SHIFTS WHEN THE FIRST PREMISE IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T PERSONALLY FIND INTUITIVE YOU BELIEVE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT YOU HAVE HANDS AND NO DEFENSE IS NEEDED OF THIS CLAIM WHAT ABOUT THIS CLAIM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE CLAIMS LIKE GOD EXISTS OR MURDER IS WRONG WHY DO THOSE CLAIMS NEED EVIDENCE BUT THE EXISTENCE OF YOUR HANDS DOESN'T

IT IS NOT SELF EVIDENT THAT WE ARE MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS THAT MURDER IS WRONG OR THAT THERE IS A GOD THESE CLAIMS REQUIRE DEFENDING BY MEANS OF EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENTS SO STARTING WITH THEM IS IRRATIONAL

NO CHAIN OF LOGIC STARTS WITHOUT AXIOMS NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE ANYTHING AXIOMATICALLY IS IRRATIONAL
IF THIS REALLY IS FASHIONABLE WHERE YOU'RE FROM FUCK FASHION IT'S BAD LOGIC AND IT'S BAD PHILOSOPHY ONE MAN'S MODUS PONENT IS NOT ANOTHER MAN'S MODUS POLLENS THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT BEHIND DISTINGUISHING THEM

SO I AGREE WITH YOU ON ALL ACCOUNTS EXCEPT THAT IT IS SELF-EVIDENT THAT I LET ALONE YOU HAVE HANDS ARE YOU RELYING ON SENSORY PERCEPTION TO REACH THIS CONCLUSION OR DO YOU HAVE SOME A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HANDS BECAUSE I SURE DON'T HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE SORT NOR WOULD I KNOW IF I HAD ARGUMENT IS BOGUS OFCOURSE IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE AN EX ALSO QUODLIBET TO ME BUT MORE LIKELY IT'S JUST CIRCULAR IF SKEPTICISM IS FALSE YOU HAVE HANDS NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND THE PROOF AGAINST SKEPTICISM IS BASED ON SOMETHING WHICH DEPENDS ON SKEPTICISM BEING EITHER TRUE OR FALSE

RAMACHANDRA HAS SOME REALLY INTERESTING STUFF ON HANDS AND THEIR EXISTENCE IT GOES FOR ALL OF US
THIS LIST IS PROBLEMATIC TO SAY THE LEAST I'M BAFFLED ABOUT WHAT THE METHODOLOGY COULD BE FOR ONE THING THE LIST DOESN'T CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN INFLUENCE ON CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY AND INFLUENCE ON POPULAR CULTURE J PAGE MORELAND FOR INSTANCE HAS OR ONCE HAD A RELATIVELY LARGE INFLUENCE ON POPULAR CULTURE THROUGH HIS ACCESSIBLE PRESENTATIONS OF ARGUMENTS FOR INTELLIGENT DESIGN BUT FOR MUCH THE SAME REASON HE HAS NEXT TO ZERO INFLUENCE ON CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CREATIONIST HERE TO EVEN MENTION HIS NAME ON THE SAME LIST AS PERMANENT GREATS LIKE MCDOWELL CHALMERS OR THOMSON IS SHAMEFUL CONVERSELY IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE PHILOSOPHERS ON THE LIST COULD BE THOUGHT TO HAVE MUCH CULTURAL IMPACT EVEN INDIRECTLY TAKE KRIPKE OR BURGE WHO ARE UNDENIABLY GREAT BUT HAVEN'T EXACTLY SHIFTED ANYTHING IN OUR CULTURAL FRAMEWORK

EDIT GRANTED THE GENERAL EDITOR HAS A PHILOSOPHY PHD BUT SEVERAL OF HIS CHOICES ARE IDIOSYNCRATIC TO SAY THE LEAST IT'S HARD TO SEE WHY ONE WOULD LIST INGVAR JOHANSSON AND JOHN HEIL BUT NOT HEAVYWEIGHTS LIKE BARRY STROUD RONALD DWORKIN AND STANLEY CAVELL OR MORELAND AND WILLIAM LANE CRAIG BUT NOT THE MASSIVELY INFLUENTIAL ALVIN PLANTING IT'S ALSO ODD THAT WHILE THERE IS GOOD REPRESENTATION OF FRENCH CONTINENTALS AND OOH FOLKS THERE IS NO MENTION OF A SINGLE FIGURE INVOLVED IN THE REVIVAL OF ANGLOPHONE INTEREST IN EXEGETICAL AS OPPOSED TO PRIMARILY THEMATIC APPROACHES TO AND CENTURY EUROPEAN PHILOSOPHY ROBERT PIPPIN FREDERICK BEISER PAUL GUYER ETC IN FACT SOMEONE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE FIELD SURELY THE INTENDED AUDIENCE COULD READ THIS LIST WITHOUT GETTING THE SLIGHTEST IDEA THAT PEOPLE DO SERIOUS WORK IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY AND THAT THAT WORK IS BOTH INFLUENTIAL ON CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY SEE THE RECENT REVIVAL OF MONISM EAST G IN JONATHAN WORK OR KRIS RECENT WORK ON BEING AND IS DONE BY PEOPLE WHO ALSO DO INFLUENTIAL WORK IN CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY MICHAEL DELLA ROCCA BEING PERHAPS THE PRIME EXAMPLE
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN AREAS OF INTEREST BUT I THINK IT'S A HUGE OVERSIGHT TO NOT INCLUDE JULIA KRISTEVA

I ALSO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT JUST DUE THEIR POPULARITY AND SUBSEQUENT INFLUENCE ON PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF UNIVERSITY SETTINGS CHOMSKY SHOULD BE HIGHER AND ZIZEL SHOULD BE INCLUDED
IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHICH OF THESE PHILOSOPHER'S WORKS HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON INDIVIDUAL THINKING ABOUT PHILOSOPHY OR HAD AN IMPACT ON THEIR PERSONAL LIFE I DON'T MEAN SOME WORK THAT YOU READ JUST TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE WRITER'S ARGUMENTS SO YOU COULD DISCUSS THEM WITH OTHERS I AM THINKING OF SOMETHING LIKE A CONCEPT OR PUZZLE THAT YOU OFTEN RETURN TO IN YOUR MIND TO PONDER OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN OR MAYBE AN ETHICAL OR BEHAVIORAL CONCEPT YOU HAVE APPLIED OR WISHED YOU COULD APPLY IN YOUR LIFE
I WOULD ADD WILLIAM EAST CONNOLLY TO THE LIST
THANK YOU FOR THIS
CROSSPOSTED FROM R HISTORYOFIDEAS
ALWAYS HAS THE BEST TITLES FOR THEIR INTERVIEWS
I'D THERE AUDIO OF THIS
IN MY UNSOLICITED OPINION THIS SPEAKER IS INDICATIVE OF A MUCH NEEDED RETURN TO THE ANCIENT ROLE OF PHILOSOPHERS PEOPLE WHO CAN HAVE MEANINGFUL PRODUCTIVE DISCOURSE ABOUT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TOPICS WITH LAYPEOPLE AS WELL AS OTHER PHILOSOPHERS EXCELLENT TALK WITH A TOUR DE FORCE Q A THAT TOUCHES UPON BUDDHIST MONKS AI AND BLADE RUNNER THE QUESTION AND ANSWER AT ABOUT COUNTER ARGUMENTS TO HIS VIEW IS OUTSTANDING AN AMA WITH ALVA NOP WOULD BE VERY COOL
HI

INTERESTING READ HOPE YOU DON'T MIND SOME CRITIQUE

PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT NATIONS WARRING AGAINST EACH OTHER IS HARMFUL FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED

DO THEY SOME PEOPLE FIND WAR BENEFICIAL AND FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW THEY ARE ENTIRELY CORRECT THINK OF ALL THE MONEY AND POWER THE NOBEL CRUCKS AND ARMOSTRONGS OF THE WORLD ACQUIRED

I CHOSE WEAPONS DEALERS BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER EXAMPLES BANKERS POLITICIANS CONDOM MAKERS ALL CAN BENEFIT IMMENSELY FROM WAR FOR BANKERS IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER WHO WINS AS THEY USUALLY SUPPORT BOTH SIDES

WHAT'S MISSING IN YOUR ANALYSIS IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND HOW THAT MAY AFFECT THEIR PERCEPTION OF PEACE BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOUR ENTIRE PREMISE IS WRONG ANOTHER THING THAT'S MISSING IS HOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEHAVE IN THE REAL WORLD YOU SEEM TO ASSUME THEY SEEK JUSTICE AND PEACE BUT MY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST IS THAT PEOPLE BEHAVIOR IS DETERMINED FAR MORE BY FEAR THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND THIS LEADS TO A LOT OF STUPID SHIT LIKE WAR NOT PEACE AND JUSTICE BTW PEACE AND JUSTICE ARE CONTRADICTORY YOU CAN NEVER HAVE BOTH

I LIKE TO CALL THIS KIND OF PHILOSOPHY STARK PHILOSOPHY IT'S GAME OF THRONES REFERENCE DUH TO THE STARKS A FAMILY OF HIGH MORALE BELIEVING IN DOING THE RIGHT THING WHO GET BETRAYED OVER AND OVER AGAIN BY LESS PRESUMPTUOUS PEOPLE IT'S A LITERARY EXAMPLE BUT IT'S TRUE IN REAL LIFE BUT IF YOU PREFER A BOOK THAT DISCUSSED THIS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK
DOCS

IT EXPLAINS SUPERBLY THE DYNAMICS CREATED IN HUMAN GROUP THAT LEAD TO BAD HARMFUL POLICY OFTEN BEING THE BEST WAY TO STAY IN POWER I'M OVERSIMPLIFYING GREATLY IT'S A REALLY GREAT BOOK

TL R

PEOPLE DON'T SEEK JUSTICE OR PEACE THEY SEEK SECURITY IE THEY ARE FEARFUL AND WILL PREFER THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY OVER ANY LOGICAL EXPLANATION YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE BE THE BEST ONE EVER SO FOR EXAMPLE I HAPPEN TO BE AN ISRAELI AND PEOPLE HERE AND EVERYWHERE ELSE THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO ISRAEL OR TO JEWS ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO THINK SO KEEP TALKING ABOUT PEACE AND JUSTICE AS SOMETHING DESIRED BUT WILLING TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN THEY PERCEIVE THEY ARE THREATENED WHICH GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGES OF COURSE


IT'S A GOOD PHILOSOPHY TO HAVE IF YOU'RE A PLEB AND WHILE IN WORLD WE ARE ALL PLEBS EXCEPT THE IT'S STILL WORTH REALIZING THAT NOT EVERYBODY IN SOCIETY IS THINKING LIKE A PLEB AND THAT IF WE PLEBS DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT WE'LL BE SCREWED OVER WORSE THA WE ALREADY ARE

PAGE SOUTH

HOW DO WE MAKE THE UNREASONABLE SEE REASON


WELL YOU CAN'T CAN YOU BECAUSE THERE ACTUALLY IS REASON BEHIND EVEN THE WORST WAR SO IT'S ACTUALLY YOU THAT'S NOT SEEING REASON HERE
I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO ARE CHALLENGING THIS POST BECAUSE THEY ARE HELPING ME TO POINT OUT DETAILS I EITHER MISSED OR FAILED TO COVER IN ENOUGH DETAIL IN THE ORIGINAL POST OBVIOUSLY I NEED MORE EXPERIENCE IN WRITING OUT COMPLEX IDEAS OR I SHOULD JUST GET BETTER AT PLANNING
I THINK YOUR PHILOSOPHY IGNORES MAN'S WELL RECORDED HISTORY OF SELFISHNESS

THE MIND IS DESIGNED TO CATEGORIZE IN MANY WAYS WE DEFINE OURSELVES MORE BY WHAT WE ARE NOT THE OTHER RATHER THAN WHAT WE ARE OUR TRIBE WE JUDGE OURSELVES BY OUR INTENTIONS AND OTHERS BY OUR ACTIONS WE DESIRE PEACE IN OUR OWN IMAGE NOT IN THE WAY OF OUR OPPONENTS

YOU ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE LOGICAL DUALITY NATURE ON PEOPLE WHAT IS LOGICALLY SILLY MAY HAVE LEGITIMATE EMOTIONAL WORTH IT IS LOGICAL TO DO WHAT BENEFITS YOU THE MOST HOWEVER SUCH AN APPROACH TO LIFE WILL DAMAGE OUR EMOTIONAL NEEDS IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS

YOUR APPROACH CAN DEFINITELY HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT IN PREVENTING UNREASONABLE CONFLICT BUT IT DOES LITTLE TO HELP BRING PEACE TO REASONABLE CONFRONTATION IF ONE HAS GOOD REASON TO APPOSE ANOTHER SHOULD THEY INSTEAD MOVE ASIDE IN THE NAME OF PEACE IS IT TRUE PEACE IF BOTH PARTIES HAVE GRIEVANCE YET HAVE CHOSEN TO GRIT THEIR TEETH AND SMILE IS IT PEACE TO IGNORE THE DAMAGES INFLICTED ON OTHERS WHILE YOU YOURSELF ARE UNHARMED

PEACE IS AN ADMIRABLE GOAL BUT I POSIT THAT PEACE FOR THE SAKE OF PEACE WILL ONLY LEAD TO GREATER CONFLICT PEACE MUST COME OUT OF SOMETHING DEEPER AND STRONGER WAR FOR PEACE MAY SEEM TO BE AN OXYMORON BUT THE VICTORY LOSS CAN BE A STRONG CORD THAT TIES TWO PEOPLE OR NATIONS TOGETHER IT CREATES A REAL TANGIBLE REASON FOR AGREEMENT WHERE NONE WOULD OTHERWISE EXIST
PEACE IS THE RESULT OF SUPERIOR FIREPOWER
ALSO ONE IMPORTANT NOTE THE REASON I POST THIS HERE IS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A BOARD DEDICATED TO UNDERSTANDING WELL UNDERSTANDING IS THE KIND OF BOARD THAT IS BEST SUITED TO ACCEPT WHAT I'M EXPLAINING HERE YES THERE ARE PIECES I DIDN'T COVER BECAUSE IT REQUIRED GOING TOO FAR TO REACH THEM BUT I BRING THIS IDEA OF PEACE TO YOU BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE THE MOST CAPABLE OF SPREADING IT I MEAN YOU LITERALLY HAVE A LINK IN YOUR WIKI SECTION CALLED A GUIDE TO ARGUMENTS WHICH BASICALLY EXPLAINS THE PROCESS OF REACHING AN EQUILIBRIUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN TWO PARTIES THROUGH LOGIC

I KNOW THAT THE IDEA OF SPREADING PEACE AS AN IDEOLOGY IS NOTHING NEW BUT I WANTED TO DISCUSS THE WORKINGS OF PEACE ON A MORE SPECIFIC LEVEL SO IT WOULDN'T BE SO ABSTRACT SO THAT WHEN THE SUBJECT ARISES OF WHAT EXACTLY IS PEACE THIS RANT MAY BE CITED FOR CLARIFICATION ON THE IDEA
I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT HUMANITY'S CAPACITY FOR REASON ALL CONFLICT COMES FROM DIFFERING VALUES BELIEVING FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS I KNOW YOU SAY THESE VALUES CAN BE ATTACKED WITH REASON BUT I JUST DON'T BUY IT CONSIDER A SCENARIO WHERE A FIGHT IS ABOUT TO BREAK OUT TWO GUYS HAVE BEEN ARGUING OVER SOMETHING MINOR MAYBE THEY'VE BOTH BEEN ARGUING THAT THEIR FOOTBALL TEAM IS GOING TO WIN THIS YEAR THEY'VE BEEN ARGUING STATISTICS AND PERFORMANCE RECORDS BUT IT COMES DOWN TO EACH GUYS FAITH IN HIS TEAM AND ITS PLAYERS THE FIGHT IS BREWING AND YOU'RE THE ONLY PEACEMAKER THERE HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THE TWO NOT TO FIGHT THEIR CONFLICT ISN'T GOING TO BE RESOLVED BY FACTS OR LOGIC AND THEY'RE INTENT ON FIGHTING THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM

I'M SAYING THAT SOMETIMES CONFLICTS AREN'T FOUNDED IN REASON AND THEREFORE CAN'T BE RESOLVED BY REASON IN AN IDEAL WORLD WE COULD TALK DOWN ALL CONFLICT BUT THAT'S NOT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE LOTS OF VIOLENT OR COLD CHILDBEARING TRADITIONS WHICH CREATE LESS EMPATHY
I DON'T AGREE AT ALL THAT A WORLD WITHOUT CONFLICT IS THE BEST THING FOR US ALL SOME KINDS OF CONFLICT ARE GOOD CREATIVE CONFLICT FOR INSTANCE TWO PEOPLE COLLABORATING NOW COMPETITION COMPETITION IS A WHOLLY EVIL PHENOMENON BUT CONFLICT WITHIN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT CAN BE A GOOD THING AND LEAD TO A BETTER OUTCOME OBVIOUSLY NOBODY CAN AGREE ON EVERYTHING IT'S HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT CONFLICT THAT MATTERS

BUT AS FOR LARGER SCALE ISSUES AND STUFF LIKE MILITARY CONFLICT IE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER COOPERATION AND REASON HAS GONE OUT THE WINDOW THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE AVOIDED THE ISSUE HERE IS PARTLY THAT THE TERMINOLOGY DESCRIBES DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE SAME WORDS

AT THE END OF THE DAY OUR LARGE SCALE CONFLICTS ARE ALL SOURCE IN ONE THING RUNNING THE WORLD ON A PARADIGM COMPETITION OF COURSE IS QUITE LITERALLY THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF COOPERATION SO OUR WORLD IS BUILT ON

AND YET WE SOMEHOW THINK THAT WILL LEAD TO A CALM PEACEFUL WORLD SOMEHOW EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE WITHOUT EXCEPTION OPERATES ON THE HALLOWED PRINCIPLE OF SCREW YOU I'VE GOT MINE OR IN OTHER WORDS EVERYONE AGAINST EVERYONE ELSE

WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS CHANGE THE BASIC PARADIGM AWAY FROM COMPETITION AND INSTEAD USE ORGANIZED COOPERATION THIS SHOULD INCLUDE SCRAPPING CONCEPTS LIKE TRADE AND CURRENCY ALTOGETHER THAT WILL AT LEAST GET US A SANE STARTING OFF POINT FROM WHICH TO GET PEOPLE TO NOT BE SUCH HUGE ASSHOLES OUR CURRENT DAY SOCIETY IS SUCH THAT THE BIGGEST ASSHOLES SUCCEED BECAUSE THEY'RE PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH KICKING A LITTLE OLD LADY IN THE FACE FINANCIALLY SPEAKING USUALLY TO GET AHEAD AND SOCIETY REWARDS THEM FOR IT WITH WEALTH AND FREEDOM

YOU KNOW YOUR TRUMPS AND THE LIKE CONSCIENCELESS SCUM BUILDING WEALTH ON EXPLOITING OTHERS

THE PROBLEM LIES FAR DEEPER THAN PEOPLE BEING CONFRONTATIONAL OUR SOCIETY IS BUILT ON BEING CONFRONTATIONAL TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE STOP BEHAVING LIKE THAT WHEN THERE IS STRONG INCENTIVES IN SOCIETY TO DO SO IS FUTILE FIRST CHANGE SOCIETY AND PEOPLE WILL CHANGE AUTOMATICALLY

THE DISTINGUISHED ANTHROPOLOGIST CLIFFORD GEERTS SAID YEARS AGO THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE THE UNFINISHED ANIMALS AND WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT WAS THAT IT IS ONLY HUMAN NATURE TO HAVE A HUMAN NATURE THAT IS VERY MUCH THE PRODUCT OF THE SOCIETY IN WHICH PEOPLE LIVE THAT HUMAN NATURE THAT IS TO SAY OUR HUMAN NATURE IS MUCH MORE CREATED THAN IT IS DISCOVERED WE DESIGN HUMAN NATURE BY DESIGNING THE INSTITUTIONS WITHIN WHICH PEOPLE LIVE AND WORK AND SO YOU PEOPLE SHOULD BE ASKING YOURSELF A QUESTION JUST WHAT KIND OF HUMAN NATURE DO YOU WANT TO HELP DESIGN BARRY SCHWARTZ

IN ADDITION TO WAR BETWEEN NATIONS WHICH HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED HERE MY CONTENTION WOULD BE THAT WHAT MAN WANTS ISN'T MONEY OR PEACE BUT PUNITIVE JUSTICE THERE IS A PRIMAL HUMAN URGE TO DEEPLY HURT OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE WRONGED YOU EYE FOR AN EYE AND ALL THAT AS LONG AS PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY ARE IN THE MORAL RIGHT WHEN COMMITTING TERRIBLE ACTS USUALLY IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE OR VENGEANCE OR HOLDING SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE THEY WILL NOT STOP COMMITTING THOSE ACTS MAKING PEOPLE REALIZE THAT EYE FOR AN EYE MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD BLIND IS ACTUALLY RATHER DIFFICULT AND A MAJOR HURDLE FOR PEACE IN OUR TIME
THIS IS ALL GOOD STUFF BUT I THINK WE SHOULD THROW IN THE QUESTION OF SHOULD WE CHANGE PEOPLE AND WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO CHANGE PEOPLE AND WHEN IS IT OK TO DO SO

TO TRY TO CHANGE SOMEONE POSES THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ONE SET OF IDEALS IS SO SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER THAT ONE MUST FORCE THE OTHER TO CHANGE

NOW MANY MIGHT SAY THAT THIS TYPE OF CONVERSATION ISN'T FORCING BUT MANY PEOPLE WOULD FEEL MANIPULATED LIKE MY F EX

SHE NOW HOLDS RESENTMENT SWORDS ME FOR ME TRYING TO CHANGE HER BY SHOWING HER MY REASON EVEN THOUGH SHE ASKED FOR MY HELP IN THIS STUFF IN THE FIRST PLACE

SO THE QUESTION OF MORALITY HOLDS IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO CHANGE SOMEONE'S BELIEFS

I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A BRIEF ARGUMENT FOR

THE SHOWING OF REASON MAKES THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ONE IN QUESTION DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEARN TO GROW ON THEIR OWN THIS ISN'T FAIR AND EVERY HUMAN DESERVES THE CHANCE AND TIME TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN PATHOLOGY

NOW THIS DOESN'T SOLVE CONFLICT BUT PERHAPS IF WE LET EVERYONE BE WHAT THEY WANT WITHOUT OUTSIDE INFLUENCE TO PUSH THEM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE LESS CONFLICT IN THE END

BUT CURRENTLY BEING AGGRESSIVE IS COOL FOR MANY REASONS GOING AGAINST THE MAN AND FOLLOWING OTHERS WHO DO SO

SO IN A PERFECT SOCIETY I WOULD SAY THERE IS NO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE SO THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE

SO IN OUR CASE I WOULD SAY USE IN ALL BUT THE MOST EXTREME SITUATIONS OR UNTIL SOMEONE ASKS FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE WHICH WILL HAPPEN IF YOU SET A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE
THIS IS A TREMENDOUS ESSAY

BRIEFLY JUST BECAUSE IT'S DERIVED FROM ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE THINGS THAT I'VE COME TO REALIZE THOUGH NEVER AND POTENTIALLY NEVER COULD HAVE EXPRESSED AS WELL AS YOU'VE EXPRESSED THEM HERE

IDEOLOGICALLY I'M AN ANARCHIST ULTIMATELY SIMPLY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S NO SYSTEM OF AUTHORITY THAT CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE ABUSED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE IT EMPOWERS

HOWEVER MY ANARCHISM IS VERY MUCH IDEALISTIC I DON'T EVEN BEGIN TO ADVOCATE FOR ITS FORMATION NOW OR AT ANY POINT IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BECAUSE THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF GROUND WORK THAT MUST BE DONE FIRST IT REQUIRES A HUMANITY THAT'S CONSIDERABLE MORE ADVANCED INTELLECTUALLY PHILOSOPHICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY THAN THE CURRENT LOT AND THAT SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE IT SUCH THAT VIRTUALLY ALL ARE AMENABLE TO REASON

EXACTLY AS YOU NOTE REASON IS THE KEY THAT'S SOMETHING I CAME TO UNDERSTAND SOME TIME BACK BUT AGAIN I HAVE NEVER AND PROBABLY NEVER COULD HAVE EXPRESSED IT AS WELL AS YOU HAVE HERE SO THANKS
THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED TO READ THANK YOU
BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS FOR THEY SHALL BE CALLED THE CHILDREN OF GOD

I THINK ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO END A WAR IS TO GO AFTER THE LEADERS FIRST IF YOU CAN
I WILL NOW RESIGN FROM THIS THREAD BECAUSE FATIGUE THANKS BE TO ALL WHO PARTICIPATED AND SHOWED A GENUINE INTEREST GOOD DAY AND ALL THAT JAZZ
YEAH BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT
I BELIEVE OVERPOPULATION IS QUITE LITERALLY A PLAGUE ON THE PLANET PLENTY WILL BE SAID FOR PEACE IN THIS CONVERSATION AND I AGREE WITH YOUR POINTS SO I'LL JUST LEAVE THIS HERE

PEACE IS ONLY GREAT WHEN WE CAN CONTROL THE NUMBER OF MOUTHS WE'RE FEEDING THE REASON HUMANKIND DEVELOPED THE IDEA OF KILLING EACH OTHER IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS COMPETITION FOR RESOURCES WE DO NOT HAVE UNLIMITED RESOURCES AND IF WE ACHIEVE THE REASONABLE GOAL I DON'T SAY ACHIEVABLE BUT MAYBE IT IS AFTER OUR LIFETIME OF ZERO PHYSICAL CONFLICT WITHOUT SERIOUS POPULATION CONTROL WE WILL QUICKLY USE THIS PLANET UP AND FACE PHYSICAL DISTRESS FROM SOURCES I DON'T THINK THE METHOD FOR THIS SHOULD BE SOME LEGAL OF GOVERNMENTAL LAW ORIGIN FORM OF POPULATION CONTROL BUT WE NEED TO GET THE MESSAGE TO PEOPLE THAT A COUPLE THAT HAS THREE OR EVEN TWO KIDS HAS MADE THE WORLD A MORE DANGEROUS PLACE
I BELIEVE IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE AVERAGE HUMAN BELIEVES IN PEACE AND UNDERSTANDS THAT A WORLD WITHOUT CONFLICT IS BEST FOR US ALL

I BELIEVE THAT ALL HUMANS WITH THE LUXURY OF THIS POINT OF VIEW WOULD FIND IF THEY START TO STARVE TO DEATH THAT THEY WOULD RATHER DIE IN BATTLE THAN TO STARVE

YOUR VIEW OF PEACE IS NOT A REAL THING IMHO IT IS A PRODUCT OF PROPAGANDA A PERSON BEING SHOT IN THE HEAD MAY BE MORE SHOCKING AND FIT BETTER IN A DRAMATIC NARRATIVE BUT THE EVER PRESENT DEATH AND SUFFERING WHICH COMES FROM APATHY LAZINESS CULTURE IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY IS INDEED GREATER IN ITS EXTENT AND DEEPER IN THE INJURY BECAUSE IT ROBS PEOPLE OF THEIR DIGNITY AND DAMAGES THEIR PSYCHE IN A WAY THAT SIMPLE VIOLENCE DOES NOT

WAR OF COURSE IS HORRIBLE BUT THE PLANET YOU ARE IMAGINING WHERE EVERYONE IS HAPPY AND NOBODY DIES POINTLESSLY IS SIMPLY FICTION IN THE CONTEXT OF A PLANET THAT IS ALREADY DESTINED TO BE FULL OF SUFFERING ANYWAY WAR CAN ACTUALLY BE A LIBERATING AND INDEED A BEAUTIFUL THING IT CLARIFIES OUR PURPOSE OUR PERSPECTIVE AND BRINGS US CLOSER TO LEGITIMATE MERITOCRACY

MUCH OF YOUR POST MAKES A BIG DEAL ABOUT THE POWER OF INTELLECT AND PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT TO OVERCOME VIOLENT TENDENCIES BUT REMEMBER THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE ARGUMENT IS NECESSARILY RIGHT OR THAT JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED INDEED MANY PEOPLE ARE FOOLISH AND EASILY MANIPULATED INTO POINTS OF VIEW WHICH ARE QUITE SIMPLY FALSE IF YOU DOMINATE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND HAVE DUPED MASSIVE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE INTO BEING SLAVES THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE A MOTIVE TO DISSUADE THOSE PEOPLE FROM RECOGNIZING THEIR SLAVERY AND AVOIDING VIOLENCE LEST THEY DEFEAT YOU BUT NOTHING IS ADMIRABLE ABOUT THAT EVER SINCE THE INVENTION OF THE GUN VIOLENCE HAS BECOME TREMENDOUSLY EGALITARIAN LITTLE TRAINING OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH IS REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY USE A GUN IN CONTRAST PROPAGANDA DOES NOT WORK THIS WAY FOOLS ARE NOT GOOD AT RECOGNIZING PROPAGANDA AS PROPAGANDA ONLY AN ELITE MINORITY HAVE THE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS TO DO THIS PROPAGANDA IS AN ENEMY TO FAIRNESS WHILE WAR BECAUSE MILITARY POWER IS VERY STRONGLY CORRELATED TO HOW MANY GUNS YOU CAN FIRE IS ALWAYS A SORT OF EQUALIZING FORCE
AGAMEMNON SAYS IT CAN'T BE THAT I AS THE HIGHEST OF THE KINGS AM THE ONLY ONE TO GO WITHOUT A PRIZE WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING WRONG GIVE ME BRISEIS NOW I WILL MORE THAN RECOMPENSE YOU ONCE TROY HAS FALLEN

AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE ARGUMENT TO ME IN A SOCIETY WHERE SOCIAL STATUS HONOR IS ESTABLISHED BY WAY OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF LOOT IT WOULD ONLY BE JUST FOR THE HIGHEST KING TO HAVE THE BEST PRIZE NOT THE LEAST ONE DENYING HIM HIS PRIZE WOULD BE A DIRECT ATTACK ON HIS SOCIAL POSITION

ACHILLES SAYS I WORKED HARD FOR THIS PRICE I HAVE A RIGHT TO IT AND IT BEING TAKEN AWAY WOULD DISHONOR ME WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING WRONG I HAVE NO PERSONAL BEEF WITH THE TROJANS I AM HERE ONLY AS A FAVOR TO YOU AND I AM DOING ALL THE HARD WORK BUT YOU ARE GOING TO GET MOST OF THE OVERALL LOOT ANYWAY SO TAKE YOUR FINGERS OFF MY STUFF

THIS TOO SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE ARGUMENT DOESN'T IT ACHILLES DID EARN HIS PRIZE AND HE HAD RECOGNIZED THE SOCIAL POSITION OF AGAMEMNON BY FOLLOWING HIS CALL TO ARMS AND ACCEPTING THE OVERALL LOOT DISTRIBUTION UNTIL AGAMEMNON NOW TRIED TO PUNISH AND DISHONOR HIM FOR NO WRONGDOING OF HIS OWN

NESTOR TRIES TO INTERVENE BY ARGUING THAT THIS QUARREL ONLY WORKS IN FAVOR OF THE TROJANS HE RECOMMENDS AGAMEMNON FOREGO HIS PRIZE AND ACHILLES RECOGNIZE HIS AUTHORITY IN RETURN HE TRIES TO CONVINCE AGAMEMNON THAT HIS HONOR DOES NOT DEPEND ON WHETHER HE GETS A PRIZE OR NOT BUT IS SECURED BY ZEUS WHO ELEVATED HIM TO THIS POSITION

AGAMEMNON TURNS THE ARGUMENT AROUND BY SAYING THAT IN THAT CASE ACHILLES IS REBELLING AGAINST THE DIVINE ORDER THAT MADE HIM AGAMEMNON KING AND ACHILLES A MERE FOLLOWER

SO THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF OVERREACTING TO A SLIGHT WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES AND I THINK IT'S VERY NOTABLE THAT THE MOST CONVINCING ARGUMENT NOT TO FIGHT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ACTUALLY RESOLVING THE CONFLICT BY ITS ROOTS OR REMOVING THE REASON TO FIGHT IT'S A PURELY PRAGMATIC ONE AGAMEMNON SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE TROJANS WILL WIN
ACHILLES HAS ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK HE CARES ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THIS WAR ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

IN FACT HOW WOULD YOU USE REASON TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF THIS QUARREL YOU'D HAVE TO CHALLENGE THE ENTIRE WAY OF HOW SOCIAL STATUS IS ESTABLISHED AND COMMUNICATED IN THIS SOCIETY WHICH IS AN IMPOSSIBLY TALL ORDER JUST TO SETTLE ONE ARGUMENT AND CAN EASILY BACKFIRE AS TENTATIVE ATTEMPT SHOWS
VERY INTRIGUING AND INSIGHTFUL POST DEFINITELY WORTH THE READ

I'VE READ SOME OF THE CRITIQUE YOU'VE GOTTEN AND I CONCLUDED THAT MOST OF THEM STRESSES HUMAN SELFISHNESS EGO AND THE GREED OF EVIL GLOBAL CORPORATE POWERS THAT BENEFITS FROM WAR

FIRSTLY I THINK OP REALIZES THAT THERE IS A FACTOR OF HUMAN SELFISHNESS THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THE THEME THAT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN THAT THE CORE MESSAGE LOOSES POWER WHAT I BELIEVE OP IS SAYING IS THAT THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF REASON IN EVERY HUMAN AN ELEMENT WHICH IS WHAT WE NEED TO TRY TO APPEAL TO DAMN THAT'S A LOT OF

I PERSONALLY HOLD AN OPTIMISTIC POINT OF VIEW ON THIS MATTER I BELIEVE THE ELEMENT OF REASON IS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE ELEMENT OF EGOISM

NOW CONCERNING THE WHOLE EVIL CORPORATE POWERS THING I TRULY SEE THIS AS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AND THE ONLY ANSWER I CAN SEE IS SOME INSANELY BIG REVOLUTION OR SOMETHING WHICH IS RATHER BAD IN THIS CONTEXT SEEING AS IT WOULD ONLY INCREASE THE CONFLICT BUT I DON'T KNOW MAYBE MARX GOT A POINT AFTER ALL
PERFECTLY WRITTEN AND EXPRESSED I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE AND PRACTICE THIS IN MY LIFE DAILY THANK YOU FOR SHARING
I BELIEVE IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE AVERAGE HUMAN BELIEVES IN PEACE AND UNDERSTANDS THAT A WORLD WITHOUT CONFLICT IS BEST FOR US ALL

UUUH NO I DISAGREE NOT EVEN TRYING TO BE EDGY BUT I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT A WORLD WITHOUT CONFLICT IS A STAGNATING POINTLESS WORLD

WITHOUT CONFLICT THERE IS NO CHANGE WITHOUT CHANGE THERE IS NO GROWTH

EVEN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE ALL CONFLICT I'D BE AGAINST IT CV




THE SELF SAYS TO THE MIND FEEL PAIN THEN THE MIND SUFFERS AND THINKS HOW IT MAY PUT AN END TO ITS SUFFERING AND THAT IS WHY IT IS MADE TO THINK
I APPRECIATE THIS WHOLE POST AGREED AND ALL YOUR FINAL FINAL NOTES I THINK THAT IT JUST SHOWS MORE OF PEOPLE SAYING YOU CAN'T I THINK IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE IN A WAY GIVE UP ON PEACE AS A FORM OF PEACE
PEACE IS THE FREEDOM FROM RESPONSIBILITIES AND CONFLICT WHAT WE SHOULD BE BUILDING IS A SYSTEM TO BALANCE INTERESTS AND AIM FOR PURITY OF COMMUNICATION
IN PART 2 OF OUR ONGOING SERIES THAT EXAMINES THE PHILOSOPHICAL ORIGINS OF AND THE REASONS FOR A POSSIBLE TRANSITION FROM LIBERAL DEMOCRACY TO AUTHORITARIAN DEMOCRACY WE RETURN TO VERY BEGINNING OF MODERN AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY MACHIAVELLI AND THE GREAT PRINCE IN THIS EPISODE MACHIAVELLI AND THE DNA OF AUTHORITARIAN DEMOCRACY WE INVESTIGATE RADICAL REJECTION OF CLASSICAL POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY WHAT THIS MEANS AND HOW HIS POLITICAL SOLUTION THE GREAT PRINCE LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE EVENTUAL TRANSITION TO AUTHORITARIAN DEMOCRACY ENJOY
OK I CAN'T UNTANGLE ALL OF THIS BUT I'LL THROW OUT A COUPLE OF CONSIDERATIONS FIRSTLY ON YOUR CRITIQUE OF OMNIPOTENCE AND OMNISCIENCE DESCARTES PROPOSES THAT IT IS BEST TO UNDERSTAND THESE CONCEPTS AS BOUNDED BY THE LOGICALLY POSSIBLE THAT GOD CANNOT MAKE A FOUR SIDED TRIANGLE DOES NOT UNDERMINE GOD'S OMNIPOTENCE BECAUSE SUCH A SHAPE IS NOT A LOGICAL POSSIBILITY DITTO THE PROPOSAL THAT GOD IS NOT OMNISCIENT BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT KNOW WHAT A FOUR SIDED TRIANGLE WOULD LOOK LIKE SHOULD WE ACCEPT THAT THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD IS BOUND BY LOGIC WELL THE VERY FIRST STATEMENT IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN IS IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE LOGOS SO YES I THINK IT IS PERMISSIBLE TO SEE LOGIC AS CENTRAL TO THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPTION OF GOD OMNIBENEVOLENCE IS MORE TRICKY WE HAVE GOT THE FREE WILL DEFENCE A VERSION OF WHICH RUNS THUS THE ONLY WAY TO PRESERVE OUR FREEWILL IS TO LIVE IN A MORALLY AMBIGUOUS WORD WHERE WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT GOD EXISTS THIS IS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS AN EPISTEMIC DISTANCE THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE A MORALLY AMBIGUOUS WORLD IS TO HAVE A WORLD IN WHICH TRILLY TERRIBLE THINGS GENUINELY DO HAPPEN AS TO WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE FREEWILL NOT SURE THERE HAS YET BEEN A SATISFACTORY ANSWER ALTHOUGH VARIOUS FORMULATIONS OF THE ITENEAN THEODICY ATTEMPT TO OFFER ONE
THE QUESTION OF EVIL DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ANSWERED BY EITHER OF THE TWO ARGUMENTS YOU MAKE SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOUR DEFINITION OF TYPICAL MIGHT BE HOWEVER THE VIEW IS THAT GOD'S WAYS ARE NOT OUR WAYS AND BY THEIR VERY NATURE HE MAY HAVE A PERCEPTION ON EVIL AND SUFFERING THAT WE CANNOT COMPREHEND THIS CALL TO MYSTICISM IS PART OF WHY IT REQUIRES FAITH NOT REASON TO BELIEVE IN GOD

RETURNING TO THE QUESTION OF EVIL IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN ISLAM IT IS VERY MUCH PART OF THE PICTURE OF GOD THAT THERE IS SUFFERING THEY ANSWER THE QUESTION OF EVIL BY SIMPLY STATING THAT GOOD AND EVIL ARE BOTH PART OF GOD S COMPLETE PICTURE

CAN GOD MAKE AN OBJECT THAT EVEN HE CAN'T MOVE

YOU RE EQUATING POTENTIAL AND ACTUALITY IN A WAY THAT DOESN T NECESSARILY FOLLOW YOU DON T NEED TO RAISE THIS PARADOX TO ARGUE AGAINST YOUR IDEA OF GOD YOU CAN T IN ANY CASE ARGUE AGAINST YOUR IDEA OF GOD AND THEN PROJECT IT FURTHER INTO WHAT IS THE CHRISTIAN IDEA OF GOD CHRISTIANITY ALREADY PRODUCES ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT YOUR NOTION OF AN OMNIPOTENTENCE DOESN T MATCH THE PICTURE OF GOD IN THE BIBLE THE GOD OF THE BIBLE COULD IN THEORY MAKE US ALL PERFECTLY GOOD BUT HE CHOOSES NOT TO HE TEACHES HUMAN BEINGS IN STRANGE WAYS THAT DOESN T FIT THE PICTURE OF AN ALL POWERFUL GOD IN CHRISTIANITY HE CHOOSES TO BE BORN FULLY HUMAN AND DIE HOW CAN THAT PICTURE OF GOD HAVE ANY RELEVANCE TO THIS GOD YOU SEEK TO ENTANGLE WITH PARADOXES

SO YOU MAY BE ARGUING AGAINST ANOTHER PICTURE OF GOD ONE BOUND BY LOGIC PUZZLES AND QUESTIONS OF IDENTITY IN WHICH CASE I THINK YOU WILL HAVE NO TROUBLE ARGUING AGAINST THAT GOD BECAUSE YOU HAVE SET THE RULES FOR HIS EXISTENCE

CAN GOD NOT KNOW SOMETHING

THIS IS AN INTERESTING LINE OF ATTACK WHICH EVEN YOUR POOR LOGICAL CONSTRUCT GOD CANNOT POSSIBLY THINK IS FAIR TO ASK ITS A BIT LIKE ASKING WHETHER AN INFINITE SET CAN BE ENCAPSULATED BY ANOTHER INFINITE SET WELL OF COURSE NOT BY THE DEFINITION YOU VE ALREADY SET THIS TO FAIL

ULTIMATELY YOUR ARGUMENT SEEMS TO SET UP A SAWMAN PICTURE OF GOD THAT IS EASY TO REFUTE BUT HAS VERY LITTLE RELATION TO THE GOD OF THE ABRAHAMIC TRADITIONS AS YOU DEFINE THE TERMS OF COURSE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT THEM TO FAVOUR YOUR ARGUMENT HOWEVER I WOULD WAGER YOUR ARGUMENT ISN T VERY CONVINCING TO ANYONE NOT ALREADY INCLINED TO DISBELIEF
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO ALL YOUR MISCONCEPTIONS IN THIS POST SO I'LL JUST CRITIQUE THE OMNIPOTENCE POINT IF WE ASSUME ONE TO BE OMNIPOTENT THEN WE ASSUME HE CAN MOVE ANYTHING WE ALSO ASSUME THAT HE CAN CREATE SOMETHING AS BIG AS HE DESIRES THEREFORE THE OBJECT HE CREATES COULD BE INFINITELY BIG GIVEN THAT OMNIPOTENCE LEADS TO INFINITE POWER YET HE WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO MOVE IT BECAUSE HIS ABILITY TO MOVE THE OBJECT IS ALSO INFINITE YOU CAN'T CALL HAVING INFINITE POWER NOT OMNIPOTENT AS TWO INFINITIES IS NOT A LIMITATION RATHER IT IS SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN'T EXIST
SO IF HE KNOWS ALL FACTS WITH ACCURACY AND THINKS HE KNOWS ALL THEM WITH ACCURACY HE CANNOT KNOW ALL WITH ACCURACY DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE DONT KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW CORRECT

SO THIS IS BOTH EASY AND HARD TO GRASP THIS MAY BE A BAD EXAMPLE BUT SAY YOU HAVE A SIMPLE ROUND FISH BOWL REPRESENTING THE ALL AND IN IT YOU SEE ONE FISH YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF THAT SO WE KNOW ALL BUT YOU'RE SAYING WE DON'T KNOW ALL BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T

SO I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING OR WHAT I'M DRAWING IS WHAT WE DONT KNOW WE CAN'T KNOW BECAUSE ALL WE PERCEIVE AND WILL EVER PERCEIVE IS THE ONE FISH
HUMANS HAVE THE PROBLEM OF ASSUMING GOD IN LOGICAL FALLACIES AKIN TO USING INFINITY TO CALCULATE ANYTHING IT'S A PARADOX RATHER LIKE OP STATED SHOULD BE BOUND BY LOGIC

I HAVE THIS WEIRD IDEA THAT IF EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT IN THE WAY WE THINK PERFECT IS THEN GOOD WOULDN'T EXIST IS LIKE SAYING IF EVERYTHING WAS THE COLOR GREEN AND WE NEVER KNEW ANY OTHER COLOR THAN GREEN THAN WHAT IS GREEN TO COMPARE TO IT WOULDN'T BE GREEN IT'S PARADOXICAL CAN SOMEBODY EXPLORE THIS FOR ME I'M NOT GOOD WITH WORDS
SEE WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO APPLY OUR VERY LIMITED SCOPE OF COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE TO A BEING THAT HAS ALWAYS EXISTED JUST THAT IDEA IN IT SELF IS BAFFLING TO MOST IF YOU TRULY THINK ABOUT IT WE TRY TO DEVELOP THESE TRAPS FOR GOD AND WORK AROUND OUR OWN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS IN MAKING THEM AS FOR HIS BENEVOLENCE OUR SUFFERING IS A PRODUCT OF OUR FALLEN STATE GOOD AND BAD FALLS ON EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US DESPITE OUR STANDING WITH GOD THAT SAYING RAIN FALLS ON ALL OF US BASICALLY SUMS UP THE IDEA THAT BAD THINGS INEVITABLY HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE AND ITS NO INDICATION OF WHETHER GOD IS TRULY BENEVOLENT OR NOT

LASTLY HOPE OF CHRISTIANITY IS NOT IN AN EASY LIFE MANY OF THE GREATEST MEN AND WOMEN OF FAITH ENDURED HORRIBLE SUFFERING BUT THEIR EYES WERE FIXED ON THE PROMISE OF ETERNITY NOT THE SHALLOW HOPE OF A COMFY EXISTENCE
ALWAYS COME BACK TO GOD CAN DO NO WRONG AS A DEFINITION AND SO HE IS ALWAYS BENEVOLENT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

THE WHOLE FALL PART KIND OF OBVIATES THIS IF ADAM AND EVE WERE KICKED OUT OF THE GARDEN FOR EATING FROM THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL THEN SURELY WE'RE CAPABLE OF JUDGING WHETHER GOD IS GOOD OR EVIL SIMPLY SAYING IT'S INEFFABLE BECAUSE GOD IS AWAYS GOOD MEANS THE TREE IS A LIE

IF THE ANSWER IS YES THEN HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT IF THE ANSWER IS NO HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT

YOU ARE ASSUMING THAT GOD FOLLOWS THE RULES OF LOGIC WHICH ARE SIMPLY EMPIRICAL IN THIS CASE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BOTH TRUE AND FALSE SO YOU ASSUME IT CAN'T HAPPEN BUT GOD IS OMNIPOTENT CAN GOD VIOLATE MODUS PONENT SURE HE CAN BY DEFINITION DO ANYTHING

HE CERTAINTY WON'T KNOW WITH ACCURACY

YOU'RE DOING THE SAME THING THAT MANY PHILOSOPHERS MISTAKENLY DO YOU'RE TAKING EVERYDAY LOGIC AND APPLYING IT FAR OUTSIDE THE REALM FROM WHICH IT COMES HE KNOWS WITH ACCURACY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OMNIPOTENCE MEANS IT ONLY DOESN'T WORK FOR HUMANS BECAUSE HUMANS DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF EVERYTHING WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE OTHER UNIVERSES OR INFINITE SPACE OR FOREVER OR OMNIPOTENCE YOU'RE LEAPING FROM EVERYDAY FALLIBLE HUMAN SPHERES TO AREAS WHERE IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY APPLY IT'S LIKE TAKING ARITHMETIC THEN TRYING TO APPLY THE COMMON SENSE OF COUNTING APPLES TO THE MATHEMATICS OF INFINITE AND NUMBERS

DO YOU KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT YOU ARE CONSCIOUS YES COULD YOU BE MISTAKEN NOT ACCORDING TO DESCARTES WHAT IF GOD'S KNOWLEDGE IS LIKE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY INTUITIVE IDEA WHAT OMNIPOTENCE IS ACTUALLY LIKE AND IF YOU GO OFF THE DEFINITION OF THE WORD THEN OBVIOUSLY GOD DOES KNOW WITH ACCURACY EVERYTHING
ONE EXAMPLE THAT IS ALSO A CLASSIC IS CAN GOD MAKE AN OBJECT THAT EVEN HE CAN'T MOVE IF THE ANSWER IS YES THEN HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT IF THE ANSWER IS NO HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT I HONESTLY DON'T SEE A REASON TO GO ANY FURTHER IMO THAT PROOF IS AMPLE THERE'S NO OTHER ANSWERS AND BOTH ANSWERS MEAN HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT THUS HE IS NOT

IF GOD IS OMNIPOTENT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEFY LOGIC AND THUS BE ABLE TO LIFT EVEN A ROCK HE CAN'T LIFT

HE CAN ALSO DRAW SQUARE CIRCLES AND MAKE IT SO
THE PROBLEM IS YOU HAVE TO USE THE WORDS IN THE MEANING THOSE WHO SAID THEM APPLY TO THEM IT MAY HAVE BEEN MORE IN A WOW HE CAN DO EVERYTHING WAY AFTER ALL THEY WERE THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED BY THEIR GOD SUPPOSEDLY HELPING THEM DEFEAT POWERFUL ARMIES WHICH IS FAR BELOW LITERAL OMNIPOTENCE AS WE WOULD UNDERSTAND IT YOU EXTEND OMNIPOTENCE TO CREATING SOMETHING THAT CAN'T EXIST AND PUT IT IN CONTRADICTION WITH ITSELF THAT WAY ALSO OMNISCIENCE MAY WELL MEAN KNOWING EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON IN THE WORLD
I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR ARGUMENT AS IT DISMANTLES MANY OF THE FALSE IDEALS HELD BY MY FELLOW CHRISTIANS THERE ARE INHERENT PARADOXES WITH THE CONCEPT OF AN ALL POWERFUL BEING BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT OF GOD THE CONCEPT OF GOD IS THAT HE CREATED THE UNIVERSE IN THE SAME WAY ANYONE CAN SET A MARBLE DOWN A TRACK HE CAN FOLLOW IT AND STOP IT BUT HE REFUSES TO DO SO BECAUSE HE GRANTED FREE WILL TO MANKIND AND WISHES IT TO TAKE CHARGE OF ITS OWN DESTINY MANY MISINTERPRET GENESIS AS THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE WHILE INSTEAD IT SERVES MUCH BETTER AS THE CREATION OF THE HUMAN SOUL HE IS NOT ALWAYS TEACHING A BENEVOLENT LESSON AND LARGELY LETS THE EARTH AND ITS CONTENTS RUN ITS NATURAL COURSE GOD HAS NEVER PROVEN NOR CLAIMED HE IS OMNIPOTENT AND OMNISCIENCE FOR THE BIBLE WAS NOT ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY GOD OR JESUS BUT INSTEAD IT WAS WRITTEN BASED OFF OF LETTERS AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS AND GOD BY THEIR EARLY FOLLOWERS AND DISCIPLES I LIKED YOUR ARGUMENT AND APPRECIATE THE POINTS YOU MADE BUT DO NOT DISCOUNT GOD SO EASILY
JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S POSSIBLE DOESN'T MEAN IT ISN'T


THE SAME LOGIC YOU USE CAN BE APPLIED TO QUANTUM PHYSICS A PHYSICAL THING CANNOT BE AT TWO PLACES AT ONCE AND YET THAT IS WHAT SOME QUANTUM PARTICLES DO
I THINK THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION HERE IS ABOUT GOD BEING OMNIPOTENT CHRISTIANS DON'T BELIEVE GOD IS OMNIPOTENT IN THE SENSE THAT HE CAN DO EVERYTHING THE BIBLE STATES THAT HE'S BOUND TO A SET OF RULES AND THAT SET OF RULES KEEP HIM FROM DOING A LOT OF THINGS ONE CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND CHRISTIANITY UNTIL UNDERSTANDING THAT THE BIBLE GOD IS NOT OMNIPOTENT TAKE THAT AS A STARTING POINT AND ALL THE REST FALLS INTO PLACE
I FEEL THAT DISCUSSIONS LIKE THESE WHILE INTERESTING FOR ME BREAK DOWN TO A QUESTION OF RELEVANCE IF GOD DOES OR DOESN'T EXIST AND WHAT STATE OF PRESENCE IT HAS SEEMS TO ME TO BE IRRELEVANT WHILE BEING BOUND INSIDE THIS FISH BOWL THE LAWS THAT I HAVE TO ABIDE BY ARE INDEED PHYSICAL ONES FOR EXAMPLE IF I FALL OUT OF A TREE IT HURTS MORALITY TO ME IS JUST AN ABSTRACT OF SELF PRESERVATION IF SOME OMNIPOTENT BEING WANTS TO JUDGE ME BY SOME ARBITRARY SET OF RULES AFTER I DIE AND DECIDE MY FATE OR NOT SO BE IT
ONE EXAMPLE THAT IS ALSO A CLASSIC IS CAN GOD MAKE AN OBJECT THAT EVEN HE CAN'T MOVE IF THE ANSWER IS YES THEN HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT IF THE ANSWER IS NO HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT I HONESTLY DON'T SEE A REASON TO GO ANY FURTHER IMO THAT PROOF IS AMPLE THERE'S NO OTHER ANSWERS AND BOTH ANSWERS MEAN HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT THUS HE IS NOT

I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HOW THIS CAN BE PROOF OF ANYTHING

YOUR REASONING WOULD ASSUME A GOD OF WHATEVER KIND IS BOUND BY OUR LOGIC IMMOVABLE IS A CONSTRAINT LAID UPON US BY OUR DIMENSION NOT NECESSARILY HIS HE COULD CREATE AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT WITHIN THIS UNIVERSE PERHAPS AND IF HE WERE TO ADHERE TO THE RULES OF OUR EXISTENCE HE SURELY COULD NOT MOVE IT BUT THAT WOULD BE DUE TO HIS WILLFUL RESPECTING OF THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR PLANE

IF HE WERE TO IGNORE OUR BOUNDARIES HE COULD LIKELY MOVE THE OBJECT BUT SINCE IMMOVABLE MIGHT THEN CEASE TO BE A CONCEPT TO HIM HE HAS NOT ACTUALLY MOVED AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT HE HAS SIMPLY MOVED AN OBJECT
THE CLASSICAL ONE IS IF GOD IS ALL LOVING ALL POWERFUL AND ALL KNOWING WHY DOES HE LET SUFFERING OCCUR NOW THE TYPICAL RESPONSE TO THIS IS GOD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS OR IT'S BECAUSE LIFE IS A LESSON NOW I FAIL PERSONALLY TO SEE HOW A CHILD BEING RAPED DEATH IS A BENEVOLENT LESSON TO ANYONE BUT I ADMIT I CAN'T PROVE THAT GOD DOESN'T SET THE MORALS AND THAT BY LOGICAL FACT THEY REALLY CAN DO NO WRONG AND THUS ANYTHING HE ALLOWS WASN'T UNBENEVOLENT OF HIM

I THINK A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT WE'RE APPLYING OUR MORALITY ONTO GOD OUR MORALITY IS FUNDAMENTALLY WRAPPED UP IN OUR VALUES REFLECTING THOSE NEEDS IN OUR LIVES IF WE ASSUME THE SAME FOR GOD'S MORALITY THEN WE AS MERE MORTALS CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO COMPREHEND THE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS OF GOD'S VALUE SYSTEM WE CAN AT BEST APPLY OUR OWN TO A SEEMINGLY OMNIPOTENT BEING WHICH WILL ALWAYS BE WHOLLY INADEQUATE

LET ME CONTRIVE AN EXAMPLE

WHAT IF DESPITE OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT GOD IS ALL POWERFUL GOD DOES IN FACT HAVE RESTRICTIONS WHAT IF GOD HAS TO MAINTAIN A PARTICULAR BALANCE IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT MEANS THAT BRINGING AN ENTIRE PLANET OF INTELLIGENT LIFE INTO BEING REQUIRES SOMETHING HORRIFIC TO HAPPEN TO ONE OF GOD'S CREATIONS ELSEWHERE IN UNIVERSE WHAT IF THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO SUFFER RAPE OR MURDER OR FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION

THAT SEEMS BARBARIC FROM OUR LIMITED PERSPECTIVE OF THE IMPOSSIBLY LARGE AND COMPLEX UNIVERSE BUT MAY JUST BE PAR FOR THE COURSE FOR A CREATURE OR CREATURES OF GODLY PROPORTIONS

TO PUT IN CLOSER PERSPECTIVE HAVE YOU EVER MASHED A MOSQUITO YOU ARE EFFECTIVELY A GOD IN COMPARISON BUT YOU DON'T CONSIDER THE MOSQUITO HAS OFFSPRING TO FEED OR DOESN'T EXPECT TO HAVE ITS EXISTENCE EXTINGUISHED BY SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC AS BEING SMEARED ACROSS MY FOREARM
THERE IS NO SPOON
I DISAGREE THAT THE THREE CONCEPTS COULD NOT EXIST IN A VACUUM INDIVIDUALLY AN OMNIPOTENT GOD COULD CREATE AN OBJECT THAT IT BOTH COULD AND COULD NOT MOVE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ALSO INFINITE POSSIBILITIES INCLUDING WHERE IT DOES AND DOES NOT EXIST ALL AT ONCE AN OMNISCIENT GOD WOULD BY DEFINITION KNOW ALL POSSIBLE THINGS AND ALL IMPOSSIBLE THINGS THERE WOULD BE NO WORRY OF DON'T KNOW WHATCHY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE BY DEFINITION THAT GOD KNOWS ALL BENEVOLENCE OR INFINITE EMPATHY AND COMPASSION IS SOMEWHAT SELF EXPLANATORY AND POSSIBLE BUT WOULD PROBABLY RESULT IN NOT CREATING ANYTHING AS THAT THING WOULD SUFFER SOMEHOW

GOD COULD BE ALL LOVING OR ALL POWERFUL OR ALL KNOWING BUT NOT ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME

GOD COULD BE ALL LOVING AND ALL POWERFUL BUT HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS AS TO WHAT IS KNOWN HENCE IT I WILL USE IT AS THIS THEORETICAL GOD DOES NOT HAVE A GENDER WOULD NOT KNOW THE FUTURE AND HAVE THE BEST OF INTENTIONS BUT A LACK OF INFORMATION AS TO HOW THE THINGS IT WOULD DO ARE GOING TO TURN OUT

GOD COULD BE ALL LOVING AND ALL KNOWING BUT BE VERY LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO AFFECT THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE HENCE THE PRESENCE OF DISEASE AND GENERAL HUMAN MALADY

GOD COULD BE ALL KNOWING AND ALL POWERFUL BUT NOT CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL PLIGHTS OF ITS CREATIONS THIS SEEMS UNLIKELY AS THE ABILITY FOR US TO PERCEIVE AND ENJOY BEAUTY AND LIFE ARE UNLIKELY TO BE CREATED BY A CURIOUS OR NEUTRAL GOD

SO ACTUALLY ANY TWO ARE PLAUSIBLE GIVEN THE STATE OF OUR WORLD OR A LESS ABSOLUTE COMBINATION OF THE THREE BUT HAVING THOSE THREE CLASSICAL QUALITIES SEEMS VERY IMPOSSIBLE MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT IF THERE IS SOME GOD IT IS NOT ANY OF THOSE BUT HAS SOME LIMITATIONS THAT FORCED IT TO CREATE US AS WE ARE

I HAVE HEARD THE ARGUMENT MADE WE SIMPLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND GOD'S PLAN HOWEVER A GOD THAT LOVED US DEEPLY AND WAS ALSO INFINITELY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND POWERFUL WOULD KNOW HOW WE WOULD SUFFER AND EMPATHIZE WITH THAT SUFFERING AND IS SURELY INTELLIGENT AND RESOURCEFUL ENOUGH TO CREATE A BEING THAT DOES NOT SUFFER SO THIS IS ALSO RELEVANT TO THE SUFFERING BREEDS GROWTH AND LIFE WOULD BE BORING WITHOUT SUFFERING AND WE WOULD BE UNMOTIVATED ARGUMENTS BUT AGAIN AS ABOVE WITH INFINITE POSSIBILITIES AND THE CAPABILITY TO CREATE THEM ONE WOULD IMAGINE A GOD COULD THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO CREATE A WORLD IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS HAVE FREE WILL BUT WOULD NOT SUFFER SO

CONSEQUENCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL SUCH AS VOLCANOES AND GLACIERS DO NOT RESULT DIRECTLY AND KNOWLEDGEABLY FROM OUR OWN ACTIONS SO IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT ALL SUFFERING IS THE DIRECT RESULT OF OUR CHOICES AND ACTIONS HENCE NOT A RESULT OF FREE WILLIAM

EITHER WAY I SORT OF AGREE WITH YOUR ASSERTION THAT GOD CANNOT BE AS DESCRIBED IN THE CLASSICAL TEXTS HOWEVER IT IS NOT EVEN REMOTELY A DISPROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD ONLY THAT SOME HUMANS HAD FLAWED PERCEPTION OF WHAT GOD IS AN ANT IF IT COULD THINK WOULD BELIEVE US GODS CAPABLE OF INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND AMAZING ACTS SO A GOD COULD EXIST AND NOT BE PERFECT BUT BE OUR CREATOR AND BE PRETTY GREAT AND CHRISTIAN TEXTS JUST INFERRED THAT GOD CAN DO ANYTHING SIMPLY BECAUSE GOD CAN DO SOMETHING THAT IS BEYOND US
CAN GOD MAKE AN OBJECT THAT EVEN HE CAN'T MOVE

WELL LET'S SEE GOD IS THE AUTHOR OF LOGIC LOGIC DICTATES THE CONUNDRUM YOU DISCUSSED BUT IF GOD MADE LOGIC THEN HE CAN UNMAKE LOGIC OR MAKE A NEW LOGIC UNDER WHICH HE CAN MAKE AN OBJECT HE CANNOT MOVE AND STILL BE OMNIPOTENT

CAN GOD NOT KNOW SOMETHING
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS ARGUMENT IS THAT THE ABILITY TO NOT DO SOMETHING YOU WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO ISN'T POWERFUL THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE REASONS WHY GOD COULD BE INCAPABLE OF NOT KNOWING FIRSTLY BECAUSE HE'S INUNDATED WITH INFORMATION WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT THE SECOND BECAUSE HE REALLY LIKES KNOWING EVERYTHING AND CHOOSES TO KNOW EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE SECOND CASE GOD REMAINS OMNIPOTENT
NOT PROTECTING THE INNOCENT KNOWING THAT THEY MIGHT IN TURN TURN INTO A PERPETRATOR


I'M A BIT LATE TO THE THE PARTY BUT I'LL THROW MY TWO CENTS IN YOUR POINT IS FLAWED BECAUSE ITS ONE OF THEOLOGY AND NOT EPISTEMOLOGY I KNOW OF NO SECT OF CHRISTIANITY THAT ACTUALLY BELIEVES IN AN OMNI BENEVOLENT GOD GOD IS FORGIVING BUT VENGEFUL AS TO WHY BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE THE EXPLANATION IS THAT THIS WORLD IS TRANSITORY THAT'S WHY SO MANY SAINTS ARE MARTYRS I'M AN AGNOSTIC BUT THAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE IDEA OF THE CHRISTIAN GOD
I UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENTS I HAVE HEARD SIMILAR ONES BEFORE I LIKED POINT I WOULD IMAGINE YOUR ARGUMENT ISN'T VERY CONVINCING TO SOMEONE NOT ALREADY INCLINED TO DISBELIEF THAT VERY MUCH APPLIES TO ME I WAS AGNOSTIC GROWING UP AND IT WASN'T UNTIL TAKING AND STUDYING MUCH PHILOSOPHY THAT I CAME TO I WOULD SAY KNOW

I KNOW YOU SET IT ASIDE BUT THE POINT ON BUGLIOSI IN HIS BOOK DIVINITY OF DOUBT PUTS IT AS GOD CANNOT MAKE UP FOR WHAT GOD HAS DONE BUT THIS IS DOUBT OF OMNIPOTENCE NOT DISPROOF OF OMNIPOTENCE BENEVOLENCE IF GOD IS OMNIPOTENT HE CAN ABSOLUTELY BE OMNIBENEVOLENT EVEN IN AN ATROCIOUS WORLD THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE OR REASON OUT HOW IT COULD BE IS IRRELEVANT

AS FOR OMNISCIENCE AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT ON HERE YOUR CONCEPT OF GOD IS FLAWED SO YOU COME UP WITH AN EASY DISPROOF BUT PARAPHRASING THE UPANISHAD SACRED HINDU TEXTS GOD DOES NOT HAVE KNOWLEDGE HE IS KNOWLEDGE GOD DOES NOT HAVE LIFE HE IS LIFE IN CONSIDERING THE MAN ON THE CLOUD MODEL YOU APPLY ARGUMENTS TO GOD AS YOU WOULD A PERSON OR DISCRETE ENTITY THIS IS NOT VALID BASICALLY IT COMES DOWN TO A HUBRIS AND A PARADOX

YOU THINK THAT IF GOD DID EXIST YOU COULD REASON HIM THAT YOUR INABILITY TO REASON HIM EQUATES TO HIS NECESSARY DEFEAT TO QUOTE LEIBNIZ TO KNOW IN DETAIL THE REASONS THAT COULD HAVE MOVED HIM TO CHOSE THE ORDER IN THE ALLOW SINS TO DISPENSE HIS SAVING GRACE IN A CERTAIN THE POWER OF A FINITE MIND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT HAS NOT YET ATTAINED THE ENJOYMENT OF THE VISION OF GOD

2 IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST YOU MUST KNOW IT FOR CERTAIN OR IF YOU WERE ABLE TO KNOW ANYTHING TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE PERFECT HERE I WILL MAKE AN ASSUMPTION WHICH IS CERTAINLY SCRIPTURALLY JUSTIFIED BUT YOU MAY NOT ACCEPT IT SINCE GOD IS PERFECTION IF YOU HAD PERFECT KNOWLEDGE YOU COULD ONLY PROVE GOD IF YOU SAY YOU HAVE DISPROVEN GOD YOU HAVE DECLARED PERFECTION IN ORDER TO DISPROVE PERFECTION

PRESENT GOD WITH YOUR PARADOXES AND BELIEVE YOU HAVE CONQUERED HIM IF YOU WILL BUT HOW DO YOU ANSWER THAT ONE

IN TERMS OF THE UNMOVABLE OBJECT AN INTERESTING THOUGHT I HAD WHICH REALLY MAKES NO HEADWAY IN THE ARGUMENT PERHAPS AND MAY NOT BE CORRECT BUT I THINK ALL HERE WILL LIKELY ENJOY PONDERING IT WAS THAT AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN A UNIVERSE WHERE THERE IS MOVEMENT WHY RELATIVITY SO LONG AS ONE OBJECT IS MOVING WE CANNOT SPECIFY FOR CERTAIN WHICH IT IS IS THE METEOR SHOOTING THROUGH SPACE OR IS SPACE MOVING AROUND THE METEOR BOTH ARE CORRECT THAT IS RELATIVITY SO EVEN IF YOU HAD AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT FROM ONE PERSPECTIVE FROM ANOTHER IT WOULD BE IN MOTION AND THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF PROVING ONE RIGHT OR WRONG

FINALLY AS A DECLARATION TO CLARIFY MY CLAIM TO KNOWLEDGE OF GOD GOD IS EXISTENCE EVERY INSTANCE EVERY MOMENT IS PROOF AND SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF GOD IT DOESN'T MATTER IF WE JUDGE IT GOOD OR BAD AGAIN SEE OMNIPOTENCE BENEVOLENCE DISCUSSION ABOVE FOR COMPLAINTS SO ONE DOES NOT AND NEED NOT PROVE GOD BY ANY LINEAR ARGUMENT RATHER WHETHER YOU ARGUE TO PROVE OR DISPROVE GOD YOU LIVE AS HIS CONSTANT AND UNDENIABLE PROOF LEIBNIZ AGAIN FOR WE CANNOT FIND IN ANY INDIVIDUAL THINGS OR EVEN THE ENTIRE COLLECTION AND SERIES OF THINGS A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR WHY THEY EXIST THERE IS NO REASON THAT LIFE SHOULD EXIST NOR SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXIST THIS LACK OF REASON THIS LACK OF FOUNDATION BEYOND ALL UNDERSTANDING WE EXALT AS GOD WE THANK LIFE FOR ITS BEING ITS PRESENCE
I TOOK A LOT OF THEOLOGY IN HIGH SCHOOL SO I WILL ONLY BE REFERENCING FROM THE CATHOLIC TEACHINGS OTHERS MAY SAY OTHERWISE BUT I FEEL BASIS IN CLASSICAL PHILOSOPHY MAY HELP IT HERE

GOD IS OMNIPRESENT OMNISCIENCE AND OMNIPOTENT ACCORDING TO TEACHING

TO ADDRESS THE STATEMENT ABOUT OMNIPOTENT CATHOLICS BELIEVE THAT GOD IS OMNIPOTENT BUT BY HIS NATURE OF BEING PURELY GOOD AND BENEVOLENT HE WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH OUR FREE WILL SO HE KNOWS WHAT YOU WILL DO BUT BY HIS GOODNESS HE CANNOT DENY THE FREEDOM OF MANUAL THIS IS WHY THE EVILS OF MAN EXIST NOT BECAUSE GOD IS BAD NOT BECAUSE MAN IS INHERENTLY BAD BUT BECAUSE WE MANKIND ARE FREE

TO BUILD ADON THIS GOD DOESN'T EXIST INSIDE TIME THIS SOUNDS CRAZY BUT JUST FOLLOW HE EXISTS IN ONE PERPETUAL MOMENT SO GOD WOULD EXPERIENCE YOU AND ALL OF YOUR ANCESTORS DEEDS PAST AND FUTURE AT THE SAME TIME AND IF YOU BELIEVE IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SPACE-TIME THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE IF GOD EXISTED IN TIME HE WOULD BE BOUND TO ONE PLACE THUS HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE OMNIPRESENT

LASTLY OMNISCIENCE THIS HARKENS BACK TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF GOD ONE NEEDS TO HAVE GOD WOULDN'T EXIST AS WE DO THUS HE WOULDNT EXPERIENCE KNOWLEDGE THE SAME WAY WE DO GOD WOULD BE ABLE TO OBSERVE EVERYTHING AT ONE TIME SO THE LITERALIZATION OF ALL KNOWING IS WHAT LEADS YOU TO YOUR CONCLUSION

LASTLY REFERENCE U RINTHRAH S COMMENT FOR THE REASONING AND LOGIC ASPECT
OF COURSE ITS TRIVIALLY TRUE THAT OMNISCIENCE AND OMNIPOTENCE ARE ABSURD CONCEPTS IF A BEING KNOWS EVERYTHING THAT WILL OCCUR IN THE FUTURE INCLUDING ITS OWN CHOICES THEN IT CANNOT EXPERIENCE TIME OR HAVE FREE WILLIAM A BEING WITH TRUE OMNIPOTENCE TRUMPS ANY OTHER POWER IN THE UNIVERSE AND BY BEING ABLE TO EFFECT ANY CHANGE THAT IT CHOOSES BECOMES THE ONLY SOURCE OF EVERYTHING WHICH OCCURS WHETHER OR NOT IT IS DECIDING TO EFFECT THAT CHANGE THERE IS NOT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ENTITY WHICH HAS FULL POWER OVER THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ALLOWING SOMETHING TO FALL OR NOT MAKING HUMANS FOR EXAMPLE TOTALLY IRRELEVANT

BUT THIS MEANS NOTHING ABOUT GOD THAT IS A THING WITH A VERY SLIPPERY DEFINITION AND IS MORE OF A FEELING THAN A CONCEPT YOU ARENT GOING TO IMPRESS ANYONE BY PROVING THAT THE GOD THEY BELEAVE IS IMPOSSIBLE IT SIMPLY DOESNT MATTER THEY DONT CARE WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND THEY DONT EVEN CARE WHAT IS TRUE THEY BELIEVE GOD FOR THE SAKE OF BELIEVING GOD AND WHEN THEY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT IS TRUE THEIR GOD BELIEF IS SIMPLY NOT SOMETHING THAT EVER GETS INVOLVED

THE ONE SINGLE INTERESTING POINT WHICH CAN BE MADE IS THAT THESE IDEAS OF GOD WHICH RELIGIOUS PEOPLE HAVE PROPOSED AND THE FUNNY ATTEMPTS SOME RELIGIOUS INTELLECTUALS SUCH AS CS LEWIS HAVE TRIED TO SOMEHOW MAKE THE CONCEPT COHERENT AND MEANINGFUL IS QUITE FRANKLY STUPID ITS SIMPLY ANOTHER POINT OF EVIDENCE THAT RELIGION OFTEN MAKES PEOPLE MORE STUPID AND I DONT EVEN MEAN THAT IN AN OFFENSIVE OR DEMEANING WAY I DONT LOOK DOWN ON PEOPLE FOR BEING STUPID FOR EXAMPLE A PERSON A WITH SERIOUS ADDICTION WILL OFTEN RATIONALIZE THEIR BEHAVIOR IN A WAY WHICH THE SANE FRIENDS AROUND THEM EASILY SEE IS ABSURD IT DOESNT MEAN THAT THE PERSON SUFFERING FROM THIS SORT OF MENTAL ILLNESS IS EVIL OR INFERIOR IT SIMPLY HELPS TO SUGGEST THAT SOMETHING IS MALFUNCTIONING IN THEM
DR HOMINID ADDRESSES A LOT OF THESE POINTS IN THIS DEBATE

I REMEMBER HIM STATING THAT EVEN TO SIMPLY DESCRIBE GOD MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE HE CREATED EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE USED TO DESCRIBE HIM IF HE WAS ABLE TO BE FULLY UNDERSTOOD BY ANYONE HE'S NOT AS GREAT AS HE SAYS HE IS AND IS CERTAINLY NOT WORTHY OF BEING WORSHIPPED

EDIT IT'S A LONG DEBATE BUT A VERY GOOD VIEW
GOD CAN'T LEARN

GOD CAN'T CHANGE

GOD CAN'T ALTER HIS PLAN

GOD CAN'T FIX A MISTAKE

GOD CAN'T MAKE A MISTAKE BABEL THE FLOOD ETC

MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS THAT GOD CAN'T LEARN LEARNING IS SOMETHING THAT ALL PEOPLE CAN DO SO WE ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN GOD LEARNING IS ALSO GOOD SO BECAUSE GOD CAN'T DO IT PERFECT LEARNING AQUINAS CAN'T COME FROM GOD THEREFORE LEARNING IS A GOOD THAT CAN'T COME FROM GOD PROVING THAT GOD IS NOT THE SOURCE OF ALL GOOD
ONE EXAMPLE THAT IS ALSO A CLASSIC IS CAN GOD MAKE AN OBJECT THAT EVEN HE CAN'T MOVE IF THE ANSWER IS YES THEN HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT IF THE ANSWER IS NO HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT I HONESTLY DON'T SEE A REASON TO GO ANY FURTHER IMO THAT PROOF IS AMPLE THERE'S NO OTHER ANSWERS AND BOTH ANSWERS MEAN HE'S NOT OMNIPOTENT THUS HE IS NOT

ALL THE TERMS YOU'RE CRITICIZING OMNIPOTENT OMNIBENEVOLENT OMNISCIENT ARE TECHNICAL TERMS OF A SCHOLASTIC THEISTIC PHILOSOPHY THAT ARE APPARENTLY BEYOND YOUR KNOWLEDGE FOR EXAMPLE THE ABOVE CRITICISM IS A GLARING SIGN OF NOT YET PASSING THE PONS ASINORUM TO GENUINE DISCUSSION CRITICISM OF WHAT MOST THEISTS CLASSICAL THEISTS BELIEVE ABOUT GOD

COULD GOD CREATE A ROCK THAT HE IS NOT THE CREATOR OF

THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT THE QUESTION SOUNDS LIKE TO THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT IS ASSERTED WHEN GOD EXISTS IS PROPOSED GOD BY DEFINITION IS ETERNAL WHAT IS NOT ETERNAL IS BY DEFINITION IN THE THEISTIC SCHEME CREATED AND ABSOLUTELY SUBJECT TO THE POWER OF THE CREATOR WHICH MUST BE ETERNAL SO IT FOLLOWS THAT ANY ROCK CREATED BY GOD IS ABSOLUTELY SUBJECT TO GOD

FYI OMNIPOTENT DOESN'T MEAN WHAT YOU THINK IT DOES THESE THREE OMNI WORDS ARE CURRENTLY ENDLESSLY CONFUSED WITH WHAT INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE THINK THEY OUGHT TO MEAN BUT REFERS TO THE FACT THAT GOD IS IN SCHOLASTIC TERMS PURE ACTUALITY LACKING ANY POTENCY AND THUS IS THE FONS ET ORIG OF ANY ENTITY PATENS
CAN GOD NOT KNOW SOMETHING IF HE CAN THEN AT SOME POINT HE WILL NOT BE OMNISCIENCE IF HE CAN'T THEN CLEARLY HE IS NOT ALL POWERFUL

THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THERE'S TWO POSSIBILITIES AND IF WE CONSISTENTLY USE EITHER OF THEM THEN THESE SORTS OF PROBLEMS GO AWAY SAME WITH CAN GOD MAKE A ROCK SO BIG HE CAN'T LIFT IT

GOD CANNOT MAKE A CONTRADICTION LOGIC IMPOSSIBILITY OBTAIN THIS IS THE USUAL THEIST POSITION BECAUSE LOGIC IS TAKEN TO BE NOT SO MUCH A CONSTRAINT ON GOD OR ANYTHING AS A CONSTRAINT ON MEANINGFUL PROPOSITIONS SO IF I SAY GOD HAS THE POWER TO MAKE HIMSELF NOT OMNISCIENT THEN I HAVE SIMPLY SAID SOMETHING INCOHERENT

2 GOD CAN MAKE CONTRADICTIONS LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITIES OBTAIN SO OMNIPOTENCE MEANS HE CAN MAKE HIMSELF NOT KNOW SOMETHING AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ALSO KNOW IT

IN THE FIRST CASE THERE'S NO PROBLEM HERE BECAUSE GOD NOT KNOWING SOMETHING IS LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND GOD CANNOT MAKE LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITIES HAPPEN AND THIS IS NO ISSUE FOR HIS OMNIPOTENCE

IN THE SECOND CASE THERE'S NO PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'VE ADMITTED THAT GOD CAN MAKE THE LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE HAPPEN SO THERE'S NO ISSUE IN SAYING THAT HE COULD BE OMNISCIENT WHILE ALSO NOT KNOWING SOMETHING

SO THERE'S NO PROBLEM
YOU SHOULDN'T WASTE YOUR TIME TRYING DISAPPROVE SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN PROVEN

I GUESS EXERCISING THE THOUGHT IN THE COMPLETE ABSTRACT COULD HAVE SOME YIELD BUT IS IT REALLY WORTH ANYTHING

RELIGION IS A MASS DELUSION AND THE RELIGIOUS EXISTS SOLELY DUE TO INDOCTRINATION

GOD IS A MAN MADE FARCE THAT'S IT

MOVE ON
THE POSSIBILITY OF EVIL IS PRIMORDIAL TO THE AEONIC FREEDOM BEFORE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD GOD CANNOT CHANGE IT IT DOESN'T MAKE GOD EVIL ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE SAID IT MAKES GOD NOT ALL-POWERFUL IN A SENSE BUT NOT IN REGARDS TO THAT WHICH MAY BE CONTROLLED OR WHICH GOD HAS THE POWER TO EXERT OVER THE BEST ELUCIDATION I'VE COME ACROSS TO THIS PROBLEM IS IN NICOLAS WORK THE DESTINY OF MAN
HOW DOES PUTTING 3RD DIMENSION LIMITATIONS ON THINGS SOMEHOW DEBUNK OMNIPOTENCE
WOW YOU COMPLETELY RIPPED THIS OFF FROM A JOHN GREEN VIDEO NICE TRY BUD
SO WE ARE GIVEN DETERMINISM THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THESE PRIOR CAUSES AND THEREFORE THEY DO NOT FORCE US TO CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE US AND THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE WE DO HAVE FREE WILLIAM

HM THIS SEEMS TO BE THE EDIT COMPATIBILISM THESIS
WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES SELF ALL DAY AND I THINK THERE ARE MANY REASONABLE POSITIONS TO TAKE ON THIS MATTER FOR ME FREE WILL BOILS DOWN TO THE WORD CHOICE CHOICE IMPLIES THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HISTORY COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT CHOICE IMPLIES THAT THERE IS MORE THAN POSSIBLE FUTURE HOWEVER ONCE WE ASSUME DETERMINISM BOTH OF THESE CLAIMS CANNOT BE TRUE DETERMINISM STIPULATES THAT THERE IS PAST AND FUTURE SINCE THERE CANNOT BE CHOICE THERE CANNOT BE FREE CHOICE THUS THE ISSUE OF FREE WILL ISN'T WHO IS DOING THE CHOOSING ME OR BUT INSTEAD CAN FREE WILL MEAN ANYTHING IF THE PAST AND FUTURE CANNOT BE ALTERED
IN ORDER TO SAY THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO ACT BY PRIOR CAUSES WE HAVE TO SAY THAT THESE CAUSES ARE EXTERNAL TO YOU BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS SEEM TO BE THE CASE IF WE SUPPOSE DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN YOU JUST ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRIOR CAUSES ALL THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE CERTAIN BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES AND SO ON SO IF YOU CHOOSE WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THESE FORCE YOU TO CHOOSE THESE THINGS ARE INTRINSIC TO AND CONSTITUTIVE OF YOU NOT EXTERNAL TO YOU

I FEEL YOU'VE UNFAIRLY STOPPED THE PUCK AT GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND WHATEVER IS INCLUDED IN THE ETC FOR EXAMPLE WHAT CAUSED THE GENETIC FACTORS TO BE THE WAY THEY ARE OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS FOR THAT MATTER IF WE KEEP REWINDING WE MAY GET BACK TO A BUNCH OF ATOMS BUMPING AGAINST EACH OTHER SOME MOMENTS AFTER THE BIG BANG IF THESE COLLISIONS CAUSED OR NECESSITATED THE GENETIC FACTORS WHICH THEN CAUSED YOUR ACTIONS OR BELIEFS OR WHAT NOT WOULD YOU NOW EXPAND YOUR DEFINITION OF SELF TO INCLUDE THOSE FIRST FEW COLLISIONS OF ATOMS

SIMILARLY FOR
SOME PRIOR CAUSES DO SEEM TO BE EXTERNAL TO US IF I INJECT A PROBE INTO YOUR BRAIN AND STIMULATE CERTAIN NEURONS OR WHATEVER AND THIS CAUSES YOU TO DO SOMETHING THEN THIS IS HARDLY A BELIEF VALUE DESIRE OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IS INTRINSIC TO YOU

WHAT ABOUT IF THE PROBE INSERTED INTO MY HEAD CAUSES THOUGHTS BELIEFS AND DESIRES SUCH AS SHOOT UP THAT PLACE OVER THERE OR JUMP OVER THAT CHAIR CERTAINLY SUCH THINGS EXIST LIKE CERTAIN DRUGS WHY DO YOU OR WOULD YOU COUNT THAT OUT OF THE SUM TOTAL OF MYSELF WHILE MY GENES AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ARE PART OF MY SUM TOTAL WHAT GIVES THE GENES AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT SPECIAL PART OF ME WHILE THE PROBE IS EXCLUDED EVEN THOUGH BOTH MAY CAUSE CERTAIN BELIEFS AND THOUGHTS
DISAGREE STRONGLY

FIRST LET US SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME ACTION ONLY IN THE CASE THAT WE IN FACT CHOSE TO DO IT AND WE WERE NOT FORCED TO CHOOSE IN THIS WAY BY SOMEONE OR SOMETHING EXTERNAL TO US DIFFERENTLY PUT IF WE MAKE A CHOICE BUT IT TURNS OUT WE WERE FORCED TO MAKE THIS CHOICE BY SOMEONE OR SOMETHING ELSE THEN WE CAN'T BE BLAMED OR PRAISED FOR THAT CHOICE

GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE NO I WON'T SUPPOSE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME ACTION WE CAN NEVER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTION AS WE NEVER HAD ANY CHOICE IN THE MATTER YOU DON'T GET TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU CHOOSE I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH SAM HARRIS ON THIS WE NEVER MADE THE CHOICE HAVING A PROBE IN OUR BRAIN MAKING US DO SOMETHING IS NO DIFFERENT THAN OUR BRAIN NEURONS DOING SOMETHING WITHOUT THE PROBE MAKING US DO SOMETHING IN BOTH CASES WE HAD NO CONSCIOUS AUTHORITY OVER THAT PROCESS WE WERE NO MORE FREE TO CHOOSE WHAT WE DID IN THE 2ND CASE AS WE WOULD WITH A BRAIN PROBE

SO WE ARE GIVEN DETERMINISM THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THESE PRIOR CAUSES

WHICH WE HAD ZERO CONTROL OVER NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOR EVEN ANY INFLUENCE OVER GIVEN HARD DETERMINISM

AND THEREFORE THEY DO NOT FORCE US TO CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE US AND THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE WE DO HAVE FREE WILLIAM

NUMBER THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BECAUSE OF DETERMINISM AND THE SUM OF ALL PRIOR CAUSES THEY DON'T FORCE US TO CHOOSE I WOULD SAY ITS MORE THAN THAT THERE WAS NEVER ANY CHOICE TO BEGIN WITH WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WAS GOING TO HAPPEN GIVEN THE NEAR INFINITE CAUSAL CHAIN AND EVENTS WHICH CAME TO THE POINT OF AN APPARENT CHOICE BECAUSE WE CONSIDER OUR BRAIN NEURONS PART OF US WHICH I SAY IS AN ILLUSION IN OF ITSELF WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTIONS WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER I SEE ABSOLUTELY NO ROOM AT ALL FOR FREE WILL TO EXIST HERE

WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS JUST AS WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IF WE ARE LEGALLY INSANE HAVE A TUMOR IN OUR BRAIN CAUSING US TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY WE RECOGNIZE THIS EASILY BUT THERE IS NO FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRUGS MAKING US DO SOMETHING VS A TUMOR VS OUR NORMAL BRAIN ITS ALL THE SAME THING BRAIN NEURONS FIRING IN A SEQUENCE THAT CAUSES US TO DO SOMETHING ITS ALL UNCONSCIOUS CAUSE AND EFFECT THAT WE DID NOT CHOOSE THERE IS ZERO ROOM FOR FREE WILL ANYWHERE IN YOUR ARGUMENTS THE METHOD BY WHICH THE NEURONS FIRE IS IRRELEVANT IF YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH BRAIN NEURONS TO FIRE EVEN THEN THERE'S NO ROOM FOR FREE WILLIAM YOUR CHOICE TO SPECIFICALLY FIRE CERTAIN NEURONS WASN'T YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE AND CAME TO BEING FROM YOUR UNCONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH A CASCADE OF CAUSAL EFFECTS THAT YOU HAVE ZERO INFLUENCE OVER AS A FREE AGENT

THIS DOESN'T CHANGE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY MUCH HOWEVER DOING SOMETHING BAD MUST BE AGAINST THE LAW THE VERY FACT OF MAKING SOMETHING ILLEGAL WILL CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR THIS DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S FREE WILL THERE HARD DETERMINISM WILL MEAN PEOPLE WILL RESPOND TO THE THREAT OF PUNISHMENT IN WAYS WE WANT FOR A SOCIETY VIOLATE THAT RULE AND YOU MUST FACE CONSEQUENCES

SO YES I AM A DIE-HARD HARD DETERMINIST AND IT IS UTTERLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH FREE WILLIAM FREE WILL IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANYONE ANYWHERE FOREVER

THIS INITIALLY LOOKS LIKE A SOLID CASE BUT SEEMS LESS SO IF WE CLOSELY EXAMINE WHAT EXACTLY THE YOU IS HERE THE NATURE OF PEOPLE IN THE SENSE OF BEING THINGS WHICH MAKE CHOICES IN ORDER TO SAY THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO ACT BY PRIOR CAUSES WE HAVE TO SAY THAT THESE CAUSES ARE EXTERNAL TO YOU BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS SEEM TO BE THE CASE IF WE SUPPOSE DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN YOU JUST ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRIOR CAUSES ALL THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE CERTAIN BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES AND SO ON SO IF YOU CHOOSE WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THESE FORCE YOU TO CHOOSE THESE THINGS ARE INTRINSIC TO AND CONSTITUTIVE OF YOU NOT EXTERNAL TO YOU

I AGREE SOMEWHAT HERE BUT I WOULD SAY ESSENTIALLY ANY DEFINITION OF YOU IS ITSELF AN ILLUSION THERE IS NO SELF

I RAMBLED ON ENOUGH



IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE CAUSES AND CONDITIONS THAT LED US TO ACT IN A WAY ARE US THUS IT WAS WITHIN OUR CONTROL TO ACT DIFFERENTLY



IF SO I SIMPLY DISAGREE WITH YOUR DEFINITION OF THE SELF THE CAUSES AND CONDITIONS THAT LED TO ME TYPING THIS ALSO LED TO YOU READING IT DID I HAVE FREE WILL OVER YOUR ACTIONS WAS I MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM

EDIT FORMATTING
A GOOD ARGUMENT BUT FOR ME IT DOESN'T WORK PURELY BECAUSE I DEFINE FREE WILL DIFFERENTLY AND I IMAGINE OTHER DETERMINISTS DO THE SAME MY DEFINITIONS IS THAT FREE WILL IS SEPARATE TO MORALITY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT FREE WILL IS PURELY THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHICH REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE AVAILABLE OPTION OR POSSIBILITY IN DETERMINISM THAT IS LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE SO FREE WILL IS BY DEFINITION IMPOSSIBLE

IN THAT SCENARIO FREE WILL MORAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CHOICE ARE ALL USEFUL TOOLS BUT OVERALL ILLUSORY

IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO LOOK AT YOUR ARGUMENT THOUGH IN TERMS OF SELF ALTERING DEFINITIONS TO INCLUDE ONLY UP TO YOUR CREATION AS ACTUALLY PART OF SELF
AND THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE WE DO HAVE FREE WILLIAM


YOUR ENTIRE ARGUMENT IS BASED AROUND A B WHERE A IS HUMANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND B IS HUMANS HAVE FREE WILL I DON'T ACCEPT THAT ASSERTION



YOU'RE JUST REDEFINING FREE WILL AND RESPONSIBILITY IN A CONVENIENT WAY TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR DEFINITION OF SELF CERTAINLY THE SELF IS PHYSICALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS ACTIONS ACCORDING TO YOUR DEFINITIONS BUT THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO ENTAIL ANY MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

MY OWN BELIEF IS CLOSE TO JUST AS THE MIND SEES FACES AND AGENCY IN THE RANDOM NOISE AROUND US LEADING TO IDEAS OF GODS IT SEES AGENCY WITHIN OUR OWN ACTIONS AND CONSTRUCTS THE ILLUSION OF A SELF
YOU SAY THEY DO NOT FORCE US TO CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE US AND THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS BUT ANY GIVEN INDIVIDUAL HAS NO CONTROL OVER ANY OF THE PRIOR CAUSES THAT COMPRISE THEM

I SEE HOW THERE IS A PRACTICAL SENSE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY BUT AS DENNETT SAYS WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE DON'T YOU FEEL AS THOUGH THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO MAKE WHEN DISCUSSING MORAL RESPONSIBILITY I EAST ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY VS PRACTICAL OR DO YOU REJECT THAT WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE
AREN'T THERE OCCASIONS WHERE THINGS THAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER PART OF THE SELF ESPECIALLY THE BODILY SELF MIGHT FORCE US TO ACT IN WAYS THAT DON'T SEEM FREE

I USED TO DESCRIBE THE COMPATIBILIST POSITION USING THE EXAMPLE OF A REFLEX TEST YOU KNOW WITH THE WEE HAMMER ON YOUR KNEE AND HOW THIS WAS DIFFERENT FROM RAISING YOUR LEG CONSCIOUSLY AS AN ACT OF WILLIAM BUT THIS COULD RAISE A PROBLEM BECAUSE AREN'T THE SPASMS OF SOMEONE SUFFERING FROM CERTAIN DISEASES STILL A PART OF HER SELF OR CAUSED BY HER SELF THEY DON'T SEEM FREE THOUGH WE WOULDN'T HOLD SUCH A WOMAN MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HARM CAUSED BY AN INVOLUNTARY SPASM OR THE AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS OF A SCHIZOPHRENIC WHICH SEEM TO ORIGINATE IN THE BRAIN ARE EXPERIENCED AS FORCEFUL INTRUSIVE EVENTS AND SO ON

OBVIOUSLY I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN WHAT YOU SAY I JUST THINK SOME TEASING OUT MIGHT BE REQUIRED OF WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE THE ASPECTS OF SELF WHICH PARTICIPATE IN FREE CHOICE AND WHICH CONSTRAIN IT
VERY WELL DONE AND IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE SOMEONE WRITE ABOUT THIS THAT HAS DONE THEIR RESEARCH I SEE YOU REFERENCE OTHERS IN SOME OF YOUR POSTS

I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE ZEN CONCLUSION THAT YOU COME TO AND I THINK IT'S QUITE FASCINATING I MYSELF AM MORE OF A PREBOOM DETERMINISM AL DENTE SORT OF DISCIPLE I SIMPLY FOOL MYSELF THAT I HAVE FREEDOM EVERY DAY IN LIGHT OF SUCH HORROR LOL I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ELABORATE ON YOUR LAST PARAGRAPH I MUST OBJECT IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY PREBOOM ALSO TALKS ABOUT THE BRAIN PROBE IN ONE OF HIS WORKS AND I WISH TO CHANNEL HIS THINKING IN MY OBJECTION THE PROBE SEEMS LIKE AN EXTERNAL THING INFLUENCING MY ACTION AND AS SUCH THE CAUSAL OUTCOME OF THAT PROBE WHICH IS NOT INTRINSIC TO YOU FORCES YOU INTO AN ACTION BUT WHAT IS THE LOGICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROBE NOW AND A PROBE YEARS EARLIER WHICH STARTED A CHAIN REACTION THAT ALSO LED ME TO A DETERMINED DECISION AT THE PRESENT DAY WHAT IF IT WASN'T A PROBE YEARS AGO BUT THE FLAP OF A BUTTERFLY'S WING THAT ORIENTED THE CAUSAL CHAIN INTO ME MAKING A DETERMINED DECISION NOW WHAT MAKES ANY DETERMINISTIC EFFECT ON US INTRINSIC TO US VS NOT HOW COULD ANY OF MY ACTIONS BE INTRINSIC TO ME WHEN THEY ULTIMATELY SPROUT FROM THINGS OUT OF MY CONTROL SINCE THE MOMENT I WAS BORN COULD YOU IDENTIFY THE PRIOR CAUSE THAT IS UNEQUIVOCALLY INTRINSIC TO ME AND NOT AN EXTERNAL CAUSE THAT DEFINITIONALLY COMPOSES MY AGGREGATE SELF HOW COULD WE SAY THAT THE PRESENT IMMEDIATE BRAIN PROBE DOESN'T BECOME PART OF MY AGGREGATE PHENOMENOLOGICAL SELF AT THE MOMENT IT ACTS ON ME

I'D LIKE TO APPLAUD YOUR OPTIMISTIC CONCLUSION BUT IN MY VIEW YOUR CONCLUSION SEEMS MORE FRIGHTENING THAN OTHER COMPATIBALIST ARGUMENTS UNLIKE OTHER COMPATIBALIST ARGUMENTS YOU SEEM TO WATER DOWN THE CONCEPT OF SELF INTO EXPERIENCE WHICH SEEMS WORSE TO ME THAN INSISTING ON A SELF IN THE NAME OF DECISION MAKING POWER YOU ACCEPT THAT OUR SELF EXISTS AS THE AGGREGATE OF THE PRIOR CAUSES LEADING TO US IN THE MOMENT BUT TO ME THAT SEEMS LIKE A DEFINITIONAL SELF NOT THE AUTONOMOUS SELF THAT CAN CHOOSE IF NOT ACT PERHAPS REBEL IN CONTRARY TO SAID PRIOR CAUSES ULTIMATELY EVEN IF WE ACCEPT THAT THE AGGREGATE SELF IS FREE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT BEING FORCED TO AN ACTION AS THAT ACTION IS MERELY OUR NATURAL DETERMINED CHOICE IT'S SCARY FOR ME TO THINK THAT THE SELF IS INDISCRIMINATE FROM THEIR SET HISTORY AND THUS PERHAPS CANNOT BE SAID TO HAVE FREEDOM AGAINST THEIR PAST


IT ALWAYS FEELS TO ME AS THOUGH ARGUMENTS FOR COMPATIBILISM ARE AND WORDPLAY SURE IF WE ACCEPT ALL YOUR DEFINITIONS THEN YOUR ARGUMENT HOLDS BY DEFINITION UNLESS YOU'RE BAD AT MAKING DEFINITIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE I COULD DEFINE FREE WILL AS BEING THE ABILITY TO CUT A POTATO I'M CHOOSING SOMETHING ABSURD I AM ABLE TO CUT A POTATO THEREFORE I HAVE FREE WILLIAM

SO IT IS WITH YOUR ARGUMENT HERE YOU'VE SET UP YOUR DEFINITIONS JUST SO AND WE HAVING ACCEPTED THEM MUST THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT COMPATIBILISM IS THE CASE AND SO IT IS THIS CRITICAL LINE HERE THAT MAKES YOU RIGHT BY DEFINITION

THE YOU IS THE NATURE OF PEOPLE IN THE SENSE OF BEING THINGS WHICH MAKE CHOICES

HERE IS THE MAGIC TRICK THE ILLUSION OF CLARITY WHY SHOULD I ACCEPT THIS DEFINITION YOU SUPPORT THIS BY SUPPOSING THAT THERE MIGHT BE TWO SEPARATE COMPETING DEFINITIONS

YOU ARE EITHER SOME SORT OF THING WHICH DOESN'T HAVE BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES AND SO ON

OR

YOU DO HAVE THOSE BUT YOU DIDN'T GET THEM FROM PRIOR CAUSES

THESE COMPETING DEFINITIONS MAKE VERY LITTLE SENSE TO ME AS TO WHY YOU WOULD CHOOSE THEM MAYBE THEY'RE ALTERNATIVES BUT THEY DON'T SEEM RELEVANT TO YOUR POINT NOR ARE THEY THE ONLY ONES IF YOU WANTED TO MAKE YOUR POINT STRONGER YOU WOULD NEED TO SHOW HOW THE ALTERNATIVE DEFINITIONS ARE EXHAUSTIVE AND HOW THEY EACH FAIL

AS FOR YOUR PARTICULAR DEFINITION IT SEEMS TO GRANT SPECIAL PRIVILEGE TO THOSE PARTICLES WHICH SO HAPPEN TO BE COMPRISING MY BODY ESPECIALLY MY BRAIN AS THOUGH BY THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY THEY ARE SOMEHOW EXEMPT FROM BEING CONSIDERED OUTSIDE CAUSES IN THE SENSE THAT WOULD SOMEHOW INVALIDATE MY CHOICES AS BEING FREE BUT WHAT ABOUT GUT FLORA OR OTHER INFLUENCES WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT NONE OF THE PARTICLES CURRENTLY COMPRISING MY BODY WILL BE HERE IN SEVEN YEARS

YOUR ARGUMENT RUNS INTO ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS COMPATIBILISM REMAINS IN MY MIND A KIND OF GRIEVING STAGE FOR DISAFFECTED LIBERTARIANS WHO WANT TO ACCEPT DETERMINISM BUT CAN'T RECONCILE IT WITH THEIR MORALS OR WORLD-VIEW PERSONALLY I REMAIN A LIBERTARIAN FOR THE SOLE FACT THAT I EXPERIENCE CHOICE AND SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IT AS AN ARBITRARY KIND OF DECIDING BETWEEN OPTIONS I RECOGNIZE THAT IN MANY RESPECTS IT SEEMS ABSURD BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL LIKE THE SUBJECT IS SO MONUMENTALLY COMPLEX THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN IT AT PRESENT WOULD LEAVE OUT CRITICAL INFORMATION WE HAVEN'T YET DISCOVERED SO IN LIEU OF AN EXPLANATION I ACTUALLY LIKE I GO WITH MY INTUITION RECOGNIZING I COULD EASILY BE WRONG
IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THAT MOST OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN COMPATIBILISM AND INCOMPATIBILISM IS LARGELY ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF FREE WILL SO YOU WERE VERY ASTUTE TO PROVIDE ONE AND HIGHLIGHT IT IN YOUR POST

THE EXCHANGES BETWEEN SAM HARRIS AND DAN DENNETT WHICH PERHAPS STIMULATED YOUR POST SINCE YOU MENTIONED HARRIS ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS

THE SITUATION SEEMS TO GO SOMETHING LIKE THIS

COMPATIBILISTS WELL OF COURSE WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY FREE TO DO ANYTHING OR ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS
MOST INCOMPATIBILISTS WELL OF COURSE WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS SINCE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY THE LOCUS OF PHYSICAL CAUSES AROUND OUR PHYSICAL PERSON

SO THEN GIVEN THE ABOVE WHAT EXACTLY IS IT THAT THESE FOLKS DISAGREE ON I THINK BOILS DOWN TO THE TERM FREE WILLIAM LOOK AT YOUR DEFINITION

FREE WILL IS UNDERSTOOD AS THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

WELL IN A DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE WHERE THE PAST FULLY DETERMINES THE FUTURE IN EITHER AN ABSOLUTE OR PROBABILISTIC MANNER WHATEVER THE WILL IS THAT GRANTS IMPOSES RESPONSIBILITY ON MORAL AGENTS IT ISN'T FREE AND THAT REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE PRETTY MUCH THE ENTIRE PROBLEM

IF COMPATIBILISTS SIMPLY SAID YOU AREN'T FREE BUT THE DETERMINED WILL YOU HAVE STILL MAKES YOU MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU ACTIONS THEN FOLKS LIKE HARRIS WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY AGREE AND HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THAT

BUT THEY DON'T SAY THAT THEY INSIST ON USING THE TERM FREE WILL WHEN AS THEY THEMSELVES ADMIT IT OBVIOUSLY ISN'T FREE AT ALL

AND BY THE SAME TOKEN INCOMPATIBILISTS LIKE HARRIS COULD JUST AS EASILY GET OVER THEMSELVES AND SAY YEAH OK WE CAN KEEP USING THE TERM FREE WILL AS A PROXY FOR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY EVEN IF WHAT WE REALLY MEAN IS A CAUSAL LOCUS TO WHICH SPECIFIC EVENTS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED HARRIS SEEMS TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF PRACTICAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE FOLK MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT FREE WILL I EAST THAT IT IS LITERALLY COMPATIBLE WITH DETERMINISM VIA SOME SUPERNATURAL MECHANISM BUT THESE ARE SECONDARY TO THE COMPATIBILISM DEBATE

BOTTOM LINE TO MY EYE IT REALLY IS JUST SEMANTICS WITH FOLKS LIKE HARRIS AND DENNETT TALKING PAST ONE ANOTHER AS A RESULT
THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IS DO CHARACTERS IN A NOVEL HAVE FREE WILL DO THE CHARACTERS IN SAY AN EPIC LIKE LOAR

IN MY MIND EACH CHARACTER MAKES FREE CHOICES ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURE BUT THE THING IS THEIR CHOICES ARE DETERMINED BY THEIR NATURE AND IN A WAY THEY DON'T CHOOSE THEIR NATURE

I THINK WE'RE SAYING THE SAME THING BASICALLY
POSTING THIS AGAIN IT GOT BURIED IN ANOTHER THREAD

YOU HAVE DEFINED FREE WILL AS THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IN DEMONSTRATING THAT WE AS A SUM TOTAL OF THAT WHICH CONSTITUTES US HAVE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE SHOWN THAT FREE WILL AS YOU'VE DEFINED THE TERM EXISTS

THIS OBSERVATION IS EXTREMELY UNINTERESTING IT'S A LANGUAGE TRICK THAT HAS LED YOU TO A RECURSIVE CONCLUSION LET'S REPLACE THE TERM FREE WILL WITH THE DEFINITION YOU HAVE GIVEN IT HERE IS YOUR CONCLUSION WITH THE SUBSTITUTION

WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE WE DO HAVE THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

THIS STATEMENT TELLS US ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I CAN RIDE A BIKE THEREFORE I HAVE THE SKILLS WHICH ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO RIDE A BIKE A MORE MEANINGFUL DEFINITION OF FREE WILL MIGHT BE SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF THAT WHICH CAN ALLOW US TO CHOOSE BEHAVIORS IN AN INDETERMINISTIC WAY

PLEASE RESPOND IF YOU BELIEVE I HAVE UNFAIRLY REPRESENTED YOUR ARGUMENT I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION
IS IT RIDICULOUS TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF INFINITE OR OR EVEN A SMALL NUMBER OF DETERMINED THREADS ALL HAPPENING SIMULTANEOUSLY AND THE CONSCIOUS MIND JUMPS BETWEEN THREADS EACH DECISION IT MAKES SO FREE WILL ONLY DETERMINES WHICH ORIGIN IS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT ACTION OR AM I TOO FAR OUT BLUH
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT ONCE WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE PUNISHING YOU LIKE IMPRISONMENT OR COMMUNITY SERVICE ETC FOR SOME NEGATIVE ACTION WE ARE INCAPABLE OF APPLYING THAT PUNISHMENT TO THIS SUM TOTAL THAT IS YOU

WE WOULD ONLY BE ACTING UPON THE PRESENT BODILY ORGANISM PART OF YOU AND THUS THE PUNISHMENT WOULDN'T FULLY ACT UPON ALL THE CASUAL PROGENITORS THAT LED TO YOUR BEHAVIOR SEEMS UNFAIR
SORRY I DIDN'T READ THE FULL SHEBANG

THE DETERMINISM VS LIBERTARIAN ARGUMENT SEEMS TO ME TO WANT NOT FOR PHILOSOPHICAL REASONS BUT BECAUSE IT PRESUPPOSES A BIOLOGICAL CONSISTENCY THAT DOESN'T PRACTICALLY EXIST

NEURONS ARE IMPERFECT THEY CAN BE DAMAGED BY INTOXICANT CONSUMPTION THE PROCESS OF BUILDING MEMORIES ETC

IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT YOUR DECISIONS ARE A RESULT OF YOUR EXPERIENCES PLUS BIOLOGICAL RANDOM WALK THAT IS THE SUM TOTAL OF YOUR EXPERIENCES WHICH IMPACT YOUR BRAINS PHYSIOLOGICAL MAKEUP INCLUDING POTENTIAL AND ENTIRELY ACCIDENTAL SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PARTICULAR HORMONAL DISCHARGES WHICH THEMSELVES MAY ALTER YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY IDENTICAL TWINS RECEIVING IDENTICAL STIMULI WITH IDENTICAL LIFE EXPERIENCES MAY HAVE DIFFERENT REACTIONS BASED SIMPLY ON THE FACT THAT THE BRAIN DOES NOT ALWAYS REPAIR ITSELF UNIFORMLY AFTER FORMING A NEW MEMORY BIOLOGY IS NOT AN ALGORITHM

ALTHOUGH EACH INTERACTION MAY THEORETICALLY QUANTIFIED AND RECORDED THE EFFECT IS STILL DECISION MAKING INCONSISTENT WITH DETERMINISTIC HYPOTHESES AND TO SOME EXTENT INCONSISTENT WITH FREE WILL BECAUSE DECISIONS ARE STILL MADE AS THE RESULT OF A QUANTIFIABLE BIOLOGICAL PROCESS

AT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME YOUR DECISION MAY RECONCILE WITH EITHER VIEWPOINT WHILE REMAINING INCONSISTENT OVER THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME FREE WILL AS SUCH DOESN'T NEED IN MY MIND SOME MAGICAL EXTRINSIC JUSTIFICATION EVEN IF IT IS THE RESULT OF HIGHLY SENSITIVE CELL REPAIR MECHANISMS INTERACTING ERRATICALLY WITH MILD ELECTRICAL CHARGES THE RESULT IS STILL THE SAME WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF OUR CIVILIZATION

I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO APPLY A PHILOSOPHICAL SALVE TO A PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM AND I APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING IT IN A DECIDEDLY BIOLOGICAL DIRECTION BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN DECISION MAKING AND THE EXERCISE OF FREE WILL FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK OF THE DELICACY OF BIOLOGY AND THE POWER OF CHANCE
AS AN INCOMPATIBILIST I DISAGREE WITH YOUR NOTION THAT WE BELIEVE FREE WILL IS NECESSARY FOR RESPONSIBILITY I BELIEVE THAT BEINGS WITH A WILL ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ACTIONS WERE DONE DETERMINISTICALLY RESPONSIBILITY IS A SOCIETAL HUMAN CONCEPT NOT A METAPHYSICAL ONE IT IS DEFINED BY AND NECESSARY FOR OUR SOCIETAL INTERACTIONS NOT BY FREE WILL
I THINK THE BREAKDOWN IS FREE WILL IS UNDERSTOOD AS THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY SINCE DETERMINISTS DON'T INHERENTLY CARE ABOUT MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

I DON'T PERSONALLY BELIEVE IN FREE WILLIAM I THINK WE ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX PROCESSORS OPERATING ON INCREDIBLY COMPLEX INPUTS UNDERSTANDING HUMAN REACTION TO STIMULUS DOWN TO A NEURAL LEVEL IS SO FAR BEYOND OUR UNDERSTANDING AT THIS POINT THAT IT MIGHT AS WELL BE MAGIC

MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IS IRRELEVANT ONLY OUR BEST APPROXIMATION OF HOW PEOPLE WILL ACT IN THE FUTURE IS RELEVANT WE HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE MORALLY RESPONSIBLE BUT BECAUSE THAT IS REALLY OUR ONLY INDICATION OF THEIR ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE
I DON'T SEE WHY FREE WILL HAS TO BE NECESSARY FOR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

IF AN IMMORAL ACT IS A CHOICE OF FREE WILL A PERPETRATOR IS DELIBERATELY IMMORAL COMMITTING IT IF AN IMMORAL ACT IS JUST DETERMINISTIC MOTION THEN A PERPETRATOR IS INTRINSICALLY IMMORAL COMMITTING IT

EITHER WAY THE PERPETRATOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION WHETHER AS A FREE ACTOR OR JUST THE CORPUS OF DETERMINISTIC EVENTS THAT LEAD TO THE ACT REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH AGENCY WE ASSUME WE HAVE





THE ARGUMENT THAT DETERMINISM OR AT LEAST CAUSAL STRUCTURE IS NECESSARY FOR FREE WILL GOES BACK AT LEAST AS FAR AS HUME SEE END OF PAGE PAGE EDIT I'LL JUST LEAVE THIS HERE
I'M NO STUDIED PHILOSOPHER OR ANYTHING SO PLEASE EXCUSE ME IF I'M MAKING NO SENSE HERE

THERE IS JUST A THOUGHT THAT I WANTED TO SHARE DOESN'T OPS ARGUMENT BASICALLY JUST REMOVE THE SELF COMPLETELY FROM THE ARGUMENT EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF THE SELF TO INCLUDE FACTORS WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE GIVEN A MORE NARROW DEFINITION BE CONSIDERED EXTERNAL WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN THE UNIVERSE AND THE SELF BEING THE SAME AND SINCE THE UNIVERSE IS CONSIDERED DETERMINISTIC IN THIS ARGUMENT THERE IS NO FREE CHOICE FROM AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE IMO ANY CHOICES MADE IN THAT UNIVERSE ARE JUST PART OF AN ALL ENVELOPING GREAT DETERMINISTIC MECHANISM

EDIT DISCERNIBLE CHOICE FREE CHOICE ENGLISH IS NOT MY MOTHERTOUNGUE
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN DETERMINISM BUT THOUGHT THAT I MADE IT UP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO DISCOVER THIS WORD TODAY
SO AN ASTEROID HURTLING THROUGH SPACE HAS FREE WILL AS IT WHETHER OR NOT IT HITS A PLANET BECAUSE WHETHER IT HITS THE PLANET OR NOT IS DETERMINED BY THINGS CONTAINED WITHIN ITSELF ITS MASS ITS SPEED ETC YOU COULD SAY GRAVITY IS AN EXTERNAL FORCE APPLIED TO IT BUT THAT WOULD DISCOUNT THE ASTEROIDS OWN INTERNAL MASS GRAVITY WHICH WOULD BELONG TO IT AND IT IS THEREFOR FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
YOU DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EXTERNAL AND INTRINSIC CAUSES YOU MAKE THIS DISTINCTION AFTER YOU ASSUME THAT A SELF EXISTS

IF YOU DELVE INTO THE ISSUE OF PERSONAL IDENTITY I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SELF IT IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT DISCUSSION TO HAVE AS TO WHY IT DOES NOT EXIST BUT ONCE YOU ACCEPT THE MORE LIKELY TRUTH THAT IT IS NOT THERE YOU CAN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CAUSES SEPARATE FROM YOU OR CAUSES INTRINSIC TO YOU

TO ME CAUSAL DETERMINISM IS A BLIND ACTOR IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE YOU OR ME IT ISN'T ACTING ON EXTERNAL NONPERSONAL EVENTS OR INTERNAL PERSONAL EVENTS IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE PEOPLE AND IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY FORM OF RESPONSIBILITY PUT ON THOSE PEOPLE

EVEN IF YOU COULD DEFINE A SELF AND EVEN IF YOU COULD ASSOCIATE RESPONSIBILITY WITH A SELF YOU'RE THEN MAKING THE LEAP THAT IT IMPLIES FREE WILL BY WAY OF YOUR FAULTY DEFINITION OF FREE WILLIAM YOU'VE PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE HERE YOU ADMIT THAT YOUR DEFINITION OF FREE WILL IS CONTROVERSIAL BUT YOU CAN'T IGNORE THAT FACT I CAN BUY THE FACT THAT A SELF COULD LEAD TO PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY BUT I FAIL TO SEE THAT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IMPLIES THAT THERE IS A CHOICE JUST BECAUSE WE COULD MORALLY JUDGE SELVES DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN ASSUME THE EXISTENCE OF CHOICE YOUR DEFINITION OF FREE WILL NEEDS A LOT OF WORK

IF WE ASSUME A SELF EXISTS THE FARTHEST THING I CAN ACCEPT IS THAT WE CAN JUDGE PEOPLE'S CAUSAL CHAINS YOUR LINE OF REASONING CANNOT GO ANY FURTHER YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN HOW PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY CAN IMPLY FREE WILLIAM

EDIT ADDED SOME CLARIFICATION AND FIXED SOME GRAMMAR
HI U SLICKWOMBAT

YOU WRITE

WE ARE GIVEN DETERMINISM THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THESE PRIOR CAUSES AND THEREFORE THEY DO NOT FORCE US TO CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE US

WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR ONE YOU OR WE TO BE THE SUM TOTAL OF THESE PRIOR CAUSES

YOU WROTE ELSEWHERE ABOUT SECOND ORDER DESIRES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BY THESE PRIOR CAUSES YOU REFER TO ALL CAUSES OR EVENTS THAT AFFECT THESE SECOND ORDER DESIRES DO I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY

DOES IT FOLLOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU ARE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SHAPED YOUR 2ND ORDER PERSONALITY AS A CHILD

IF SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU ARE THESE PEOPLE

I CAN UNDERSTAND IT AS A POETIC METAPHOR OR AS A MYSTICAL EXPRESSION BUT IS THAT HOW YOU MEANT IT

I CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU SAY THAT THESE PEOPLE SHAPED WHO YOU ARE BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN BE LITERALLY UNDERSTOOD TO BE THEM CAN YOU EXPLAIN

AFTER ALL IT SEEMS THAT YOUR MOTIVATION IS THAT THESE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS EXTERNAL TO YOU

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR CONCEPTION WANDERS IN THE DIRECTION OF IN BUDDHISM IS THAT WHERE YOU ARE HEADED


THIS IS THE FIRST POST IN R PHILOSOPHY ABOUT FREE WILL WORTH READING IN YEARS WELL DONE
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROBE YOU MENTIONED BEING THE CAUSE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS BEING THE CAUSE ASIDE FROM THE SCALE AND SPEED OF EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN I CONTEND THAT IF YOU SAY WE JUST ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF A BUNCH OF PRIOR CAUSES THEN THE PROBE QUALIFIES AS ONE OF THOSE PRIOR CAUSES WHY WOULDN'T IT THE WAY I'M UNDERSTANDING YOUR PROPOSAL EVEN THOUGH A PROBE IS CONTROLLING YOU YOU WOULD STILL BE MORALLY CULPABLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS
THE POINT THAT IS SO OFTEN MISSED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS IS A SIMPLE BUT IMPACTFUL ONE OUR BRAINS ARE PHYSICAL OBJECTS MADE OF PHYSICAL THINGS WE UNDERSTAND INDIVIDUALLY HOW THOSE THINGS OF WHICH THEY ARE MADE FUNCTION AND THEY ARE EITHER DETERMINISTIC OR RANDOM DEPENDING ON YOUR INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS AND OFTEN SEEM TO BE SOMETHING OF BOTH HOW IS IT THAT ONE CAN COME TO BELIEVE THAT THE SUM OF DETERMINISTIC ACTORS CAN RESULT IN SOMETHING WHICH HAS FREE WILL AND IS BY DEFINITION
I AGREE AND FIND IT RATHER OBVIOUS PEOPLE ALL BECOME INADVERTENT DUALISTS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BRAIN AS IF ANYTHING THAT IS DISCOVERED ABOUT HOW WE MAKE DECISIONS SOMEHOW BECOMES NOT US IT'S LIKE SAYING YOUR CAR'S ENGINE CAN'T EXPLAIN DRIVING BECAUSE THE ENGINE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STEERING WHEEL THAT YOU EXPERIENCE DIRECTLY

WHAT MAKES SOMEONE MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING IS IF THEY SOURCE THE MECHANISTIC PROCESSES THAT LEAD TO AN ACTION NOT WHETHER THEY ARE MECHANISTIC OR NOT IT'S DAFT TO SAY WELL THOSE FORCES ARE MECHANISTIC SO THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE THEY COULDN'T HELP IT TO WHICH I ANSWER YES THEY COULD NOT HELP IT THAT IS WHY THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE THAT IS WHAT RESPONSIBILITY MEANS SOME THING INSIDE THEM COMPELLING THEM TO DO A THING WHEN THEY COULD HAVE HAD SOME OTHER ARRANGEMENT OF BITS THAT WOULDN'T

FREE WILL CAN ONLY EXIST IF DETERMINISM IS TRUE THE CONTRARY CASE SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THIS BEYOND ALL DOUBT IMAGINE A TRULY FREE WILLIAM NO PREVIOUS CAUSES HAVE ANY PREDICTABLE RELATIONSHIP TO THE PERSON'S CHOICES OR BEHAVIOR THIS MEANS THE PERSON CAN'T LEARN ANYTHING KNOWLEDGE AFFECTS PERCEPTION BELIEF AND THEREFORE BEHAVIORS THAT USE BELIEFS TO ACHIEVE GOALS THE PERSON IS INDIFFERENT TO THE EFFECTS OF ANY OF THEIR ACTIONS KILLING A MILLION PEOPLE OR BRUSHING OF TEETH ARE EQUALLY PREDICTED BECAUSE REASONING ABOUT CAUSE AND EFFECT WOULD MAKE THE WILL

SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD PROBABLY DESTROY THEMSELVES OR OTHERS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THEY WOULD BE INCAPABLE OF BEING WHAT ANY REASONABLE PERSON WOULD DESCRIBE AS A MORAL ACTOR THEY WOULD BE INCAPABLE OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
YOU'VE BASICALLY FORMALISED THE VIEWPOINT I'VE HELD FOR SOMETIME SO THANKS
I ALWAYS LOOKED AT IT FROM THIS ANGLE WE ARE DETERMINED MOSTLY BY CAUSAL FACTORS BUT WE LIVE WITH ONLY A PARTIAL UNDERSTANDING OF ALL THE WORKINGS SO AS RESULT IT HAS BECOME NECESSARY TO IMPROVISE IE MAKE AN ARBITRARY DECISION IN THE FACE OF ADVERSE UNCERTAINTY
I AGREE WITH YOUR VIEW WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE ARGUMENT IN TERMS OF MORAL RESPONSIBILITY WE CAN HAVE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY WITHIN THE SYSTEM THAT CONTAINS US OR OUR SELVES HOWEVER YOU DEFINE THE SELF AND THIS CAN BE COMPATIBLE WITH DETERMINISM BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING INTRINSICALLY SINCE THERE ISN'T AN EXTERNAL FORCE ACTING WE CAN VIEW OURSELVES AS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS
TO THEN GO ON TO SAY THAT WE SOMEHOW HAVE A CHOICE ABOUT THOSE ACTIONS SEEMS LIKE A LEAP MY DEFINITION OF CHOICE IS A STRICT ONE WHEREIN WE HAVE OUTCOMES A AND B AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE FREELY BETWEEN WHICH ONE OCCURS I THINK THIS IS MAYBE WHERE OUR ARGUMENTS DEPART AND IT COULD SIMPLY BE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF THE WORD CHOICE
THE LINE THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE WE HAVE FREE WILL DOESN'T HOLD THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE IE IF WE HAVE FREE WILL THEN WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS THOUGH NOT THIS BEING TREATED AS MORALLY RESPONSIBLE IN SOCIETY AND HAVING SOME KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL CONTROL OVER ACTIONS ARE WORLDS APART
I MADE A POST ABOUT DETERMINISM IN R AWAKENED IT WILL PROBABLY GET A MORE LIVELY RESPONSE I'M SURE MY TERMINOLOGY BELIEF SYSTEMS WILL BRING SOME INCREDULOUS RESPONSES

I AM A DETERMINIST AND BELIEVE WE ARE FREE I THINK WE HAVE THE WRONG CONCEPT OF FREE WILLIAM FREE WILL STEMS FROM AN INTUITED NOTION OF FREEDOM I DISCUSS THIS AS OUR TRUE FREEDOM AND A FEELING OF INVOLVEMENT IN ACTION OR POWER OVER THINGS THIS ONE IS FALSE WE ARE ONLY INVOLVED WITH THINGS AND HAVE A POWER TO INFLUENCE THINGS IN SO FAR AS WE BELIEVE WE ARE WE ARE SOME CAUSATIVE ACTORS TAKING PART IN THE CAUSATIVE CHAIN BUT THEN QUEUE SPINOZA IF WE ARE PART OF IT WE ARE DETERMINED

SEE MY FULL DISCUSSION

CLARIFIED THE SECOND PORTION OF OUR CONCEPT IS MISTAKEN
DO YOU BELIEVE CONSCIOUSNESS CAN EXIST WITHOUT FREE WILL
I THINK THERE'S COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN COMPATIBALISM AND LIBERTARIANISM ACTUALLY

FOR MOST OF OUR LIFE AND ACTIVITY AND INTENTIONS IT IS IN FACT AS YOU SAY WE ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF PRIOR CAUSES WE SET RULES AND PLAY GAMES AND SOCIETY IS A GAME WE PLAY BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO RADICALLY FREE IN THAT WE CAN SAY FUCK IT ALL AND WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN START A NEW GAME ALL OVER
SO WE ARE GIVEN DETERMINISM THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THESE PRIOR CAUSES AND THEREFORE THEY DO NOT FORCE US TO CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE US AND THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE WE DO HAVE FREE WILLIAM

SO WE ARE GIVEN DETERMINISM THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THESE PRIOR CAUSES AND THEREFORE THEY RESULT IN HOW WE ACT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SUM OF ALL PRIOR CAUSES CHOICE AND THEREFORE WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE WE DO NOT HAVE FREE WILLIAM
THE IDEA THAT EVERY EVENT IS NECESSITATED BY ANTECEDENT EVENTS AND CONDITIONS TOGETHER WITH THE LAWS OF NATURE

BUT THE LAWS OF NATURE AREN'T LAWS THAT GOVERN OR MAKE ANYTHING NECESSARY THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE SIMPLY TRUE STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW THE UNIVERSE BEHAVES INDEED THEY ARE ONLY TRUE STATEMENTS BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE BEHAVES THE WAY IT DOES TO SUPPOSE THAT THE TRUTH OF THE LAWS OF NATURE BRINGS ABOUT THAT BEHAVIOR IS TO PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE
IS THIS MEANINGFULLY DIFFERENT THAN AN AGNOSTIC ADAPTATION OF PREORDAINED HARMONY
IF THERE IS A GUN TO YOUR HEAD THEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GUNS IS WHAT CAUSES YOU TO ACT THEREFORE EVEN WHEN YOU ARE COERCED YOU HAVE FREE WILL UNDER YOUR DEFINITION OF HOW THINGS CAUSE YOU TO ACT IF YOU HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF GUNS AND DID NOT THINK THE GUY COULD KILL YOU THEN UNDER YOUR DEFINITION YOU WOULD NOT BE ACTING UNDER FREE WILL AND WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE

THIS SEEMS LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF FREE WILLIAM
I AM NOT WILLING TO MAKE JUDGEMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE WORKING ON A UNIQUE MEAN OF THE TERM FREE WILL
THIS ALL DEPENDS ON HOW FREE WILL IS DETERMINED

ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WE ARE JUST BAGS OF EQUATIONS RUNNING AROUND DOING A FEW THINGS LOTS OF LITTLE EQUATIONS THAT SEEM INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER LIKE ATOMS

WHAT DOES FREE WILL EVEN MEAN THEN IT MEANS THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION DEPENDS ON THE DEFINITIONS OF THE WORDS SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE THE SCIENCE WORKED OUT OR SUGGESTED
SICK NAME DROP RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING
FREE WILL IS UNDERSTOOD AS THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

OOH I CAN'T SAY I LIKE THIS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SAYING MORAL RESPONSIBILITY FOLLOWS FROM FREE WILL GIVEN THE INHERENT NATURE OF FREE WILL IS ONE THING BUT STARTING WITH MORAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORKING BACKWARDS FROM THERE STRIKES ME AS UNUSUAL AND KIND OF ASKING FOR PROBLEMS

IF WE SUPPOSE DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN YOU JUST ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRIOR CAUSES

THIS IS ALL VERY WELL IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ME IN THE SENSE OF THE PHYSICAL FORM AND CONSTITUENT COMPONENTS OF MY BODY BUT WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT FREE WILL THE ME THAT I'M INTERESTED IN IS MY CONSCIOUS IDENTITY AND PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD AND OF MY OWN MIND IT SEEMS THAT PHYSICALLY SPEAKING YOU CAN JUST IGNORE MY SUBJECTIVE EXISTENCE FOCUS ENTIRELY ON WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE PARTICLES AND FORCE FIELDS IN MY BODY AND DETERMINE EXACTLY THE SAME FUTURE OUTCOME THAT IS TO SAY MY SUBJECTIVE EXISTENCE SEEMS INCIDENTAL TO MY ACTIONS AND THE EFFECTS THEY BRING ABOUT AND IF THAT'S THE CASE HOW DOES MY SUBJECTIVE EXISTENCE CARRY ANY MORAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE EFFECTS
DIFFERENTLY PUT IF WE MAKE A CHOICE BUT IT TURNS OUT WE WERE FORCED TO MAKE THIS CHOICE BY SOMEONE OR SOMETHING ELSE THEN WE CAN'T BE BLAMED OR PRAISED FOR THAT CHOICE

YOU CANNOT BE FORCED TO TAKE AN ACTION YOU MUST SURRENDER YOUR AUTONOMY YOUR CONTROL IN ORDER FOR THIS TO OCCUR AT LEAST FOR ALL SUCH MORAL CONSIDERATIONS
THIS IS THE I THINK THEREFORE I AM OF
YOU CAN KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
BABA HERE READ UP ON BEHAVIORISM IT'S THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND LAYS OUT EMPIRICALLY HOW OUR THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIOR ARE DETERMINED ANYTHING BY SKINNER BUT SCIENCE AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR BASICALLY LAYS IT ALL OUT
ACCORDING TO YOUR ARGUMENT THE SUN CHOOSES ITS PATH AROUND THE MILKY WAY AND THE PLANETS CHOOSE THEIR PATHS AROUND THE SUN THEY ARE AFTER ALL THE SUM OF ALL PRIOR CAUSES

NOT TO BE TOO HARSH BUT YOUR THINKING ON THIS SUBJECT IS AT THE NOVICE LEVEL
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT TOO
WHY IS THIS STILL AGED EVEN IF THE WORLD HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE
THIS SUBREDDIT MINDFUCKS ME EVERY TIME I OPEN IT UP
WE SHOULD ACCEPT THAT WE ARE A PART OF THE UNIVERSE NOT SEPARATED INDIVIDUALS UNDER THAT PREMISE THERE IS NO NEED FOR CONCEPTS LIKE FREEDOM NOR DETERMINISM
HERE IS WHY I DONT BELIEVE IN FREE WILLIAM WE ARE CONSTANTLY GATHERING AND STORING DATA WITH OUR SENSES WE ARE ACTIVELY COLLECTING DATA OR PASSIVELY I E READING A BOOK OR THIS SENTENCE YOU ARE CONSCIOUS OF MOST OF THE DATA YOU GATHER A SCENARIO WHERE YOU ARE PASSIVELY GATHERING DATA WOULD BE WALKING AND HEARING THE SOUND OF YOUR FOOTSTEPS ON THE CONCRETE OR PEOPLE TALKING ON THE SIDEWALK ACROSS FROM YOU THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE ETC SOMETIMES YOU ARE AWARE OF THE DATA YOU COLLECT SOMETIMES YOU AREN'T BUT IT ALL GETS STORED

NOW WHEN I SAY FREE WILL I MEAN FREE WILL AS IN THE ABILITY TO ACT NOT BASED ON PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES AND THAT IS THE FREE WILL WE LACK
EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE HAS ONE END GOALS ESSENTIALLY END GOAL BEING A MAXIMUM OUTPUT OF HAPPINESS COMFORT OR WELL BEING TO SIMPLIFY IT I JUST REFER TO THE END GOAL AS YOUR HAPPINESS EVERY ACTION IS YOU DOING WHAT YOU BELIEVE WILL MAKE YOU HAPPIER IN THE END EVERY SINGLE ONE DOWN TO THE POSITION YOU ARE SITTING LYING OR STANDING IN RIGHT NOW THAT POSITION IS THE ONE YOU THOUGHT WOULD BRING YOU MAXIMUM COMFORT THEREFORE HAPPINESS HERE ARE SCENARIOS WHERE ONE WOULD SAY BUT HOW DOES THIS MAKE ME HAPPY I D DO OR DO DO THIS AND I HATE IT ETC

GOING TO WORK

YOU GO TO WORK AND YOU HATE IT HOWEVER YOU KNOW IF YOU STOP GOING TO WORK YOU MAY END UP HOMELESS OR TO MAINTAIN THE LIFESTYLE ENJOY OUT OF WORK YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR JOB AND THAT LIFESTYLE IS WORTH WORKING A JOB YOU HATE OR YOU HAVE A FAMILY AND YOU DONT WANT TO PUT THE POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING BURDEN ON THEM ITS NOT WORTH THE RISK

2 SUICIDE HOW CAN ANYONE BE HAPPY IF THEYRE DEAD

THERE ARE DIFFERENT REASONS PEOPLE KILL THEMSELVES

DEPRESSION DEPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY A LACK OF HAPPINESS NOTHING MAKES YOU HAPPY WE HUMANS STRIVE FOR HAPPINESS ITS WHAT WE LIVE FOR DEBATEABLE TO YOU I WONT GO INTO IT THESE PEOPLE ESSENTIALLY HATE NOT BEING HAPPY SO MUCH THAT ENDING THIS LACK OF HAPPINESS IS BETTER THAN ENDURING IT

PEOPLE WITHOUT DEPRESSION
YOU LOST YOUR JOB YOUR SO CHEATED YOURE GOING TO PRISON FOR LIFE A CLOSE RELATIVE DIED ETC REASONS PEOPLE MAY KILL THEMSELVES

ALL THESE PEOPLE ESSENTIALLY DECIDE THAT THEYD BE HAPPIER NOT LIVING ANYMORE AND FACING THE CONSEQUENCES OR DEALING WITH THE UNHAPPINESS THEY CALCULATE COMING IN THE FUTURE

PUTTING YOUR DOG DOWN HES YOUR BEST FRIEND HOW DOES THAT BENEFIT YOU
YOU KNOW YOUR DOG IS IN A LOT OF PAIN AND YOU WOULD BE HAPPIER NOT SEEING HIM SUFFER EVERY DAY AND PROLONGING THAT AGANOZING PAIN EVEN THOUGH IT HURTS YOU DEEPLY TO SEE HIM DIE

GIVING A HOMELESS MAN MONEY

YOU LOSE A QUARTER DOLLAR WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE TO GIVE HIM YOU DONT KNOW HIM YOUR WELL BEING IS CERTAINLY NOT BETTER GIVING THESE THINGS TO HIM HOW DOES IT BENEFIT YOU

EMPATHY THE HAPPINESS IT WOULD BRING YOU TO MAKE SOMEONE ELSE HAPPY IS WORTH THE COST A DOLLAR IS NOTHING TO HELP OUT A FELLOW HUMAN BEING IN YOUR EYES

GOING TO SCHOOL
YOU HATE IT BUT YOU KNOW MOUILL BE HAPPIER IN THE LONG RUN AND ITS WORTH IT

THE LIST GOES ON EVERYTHING YOU DO IS TO BE HAPPY BUT WHY DOES THAT MEAN WE LACK FREE WILL SO WHAT IF EVERYTHING WE DO IS TO BE HAPPY

YOU ARE AT POINT A YOU MUST GET TO POINT B THERE ARE PATHS TO GET THERE YOURE BAREFOOT

PATH A IS MADE OUT OF LAVA
PATH B IS MADE OUT OF BROKEN GLASS
PATH C IS NICE COOL CONCRETE LOOKING REAL GOOD

YOU MIGHT SAY YOU CHOSE PATH C BUT PREVIOUS DATA YOU COLLECTED TOLD YOU THE OTHER 2 PATHS WOULD MAKE YOU MUCH LESS HAPPIER TO TAKE THAN PATH COUNTY

WELL OBVIOUSLY THERE IS ONLY ONE OPTION THERE WHAT ABOUT SITUATIONS WHERE THE PATH ISNT SO OBVIOUS
THIS IS WHERE THE PREVIOUS DATA YOUR SENSES GATHERED AND STORED COMES INTO PLAY YOU USE THIS PREVIOUSLY STORED DATA TO CALCULATE MAXIMUM HAPPINESS TIMES OUT OF ALWAYS USE PREVIOUS DATA YOU COLLECTED TO CALCULATE YOUR HAPPINESS AND THE THOUGH THE ANSWER MAY NOT BE CLEAR AT FIRST IN THE END NO MATTER HOW UNSURE ABOUT A DECISION YOU MAKE THE DECISION MADE IS THE ONLY ONE YOU COULD HAVE COME TO USING THE DATA AT HAND YOU WERE ALWAYS GOING TO CALCULATE THAT X DECISION WOULD RESULT IN MAXIMUM HAPPINESS

WHAT ARE MISTAKES IN LIFE DECISIONS YOU MADE THAT RESULTED IN UNHAPPINESS NOTHING MORE

SO YOU GO THROUGH LIFE COLLECTING DATA AND USING IT TO MAKE DECISIONS SOMETIMES THE DECISION IS TO COLLECT DATA BUT YOU ONLY DO SO ACTIVELY IF YOU BELIEVE IT WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPIER TO DO SO LISTEN TO THAT CONVERSATION READ THAT BOOK ETC ACTIVE DATA COLLECTION IS NOT FREE WILL BECAUSE YOU USE PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO COLLECT THIS DATA

SO BECAUSE COLLECTING DATA IS NOT IN YOUR CONTROL FREE WILL NONE OF THE ACTIONS RESULTING FROM THAT DATA COLLECTION CAN BE CONSIDERED FREE WILLIAM


FREE WILL IS A USELESS CONCEPT BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE IT'S A HYPOTHESIS WITHOUT A CONNECTION OR PREDICTION BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN POORLY OR AMBIGUOUSLY DEFINITE AND BECAUSE IT'S AN ULTIMATELY IRRELEVANT QUESTION

OUR MINDS VERY IN STATE FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT BASED ON THE SUM OF OUR EXPERIENCES SO IF DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEM IF SOMEHOW YOUR BRAIN WAS PERFECTLY COPIED YOU WERE CLONED AND BOTH OF YOU WERE ASKED WHAT YOU THINK OF SOMETHING YOU WOULD RESPOND IN THE SAME WAY
YOU SEEM TO HAVE SIMPLY REPLACED THE WORD PREDETERMINED WITH FORCED THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHETHER OR NOT ONE CHOOSES FREELY THE SUM TOTAL OF PRIOR CAUSES DOESN'T FORCE US TO CHOOSE BUT IT DOES DETERMINE WHAT THE CHOICE IS GOING TO BE THEREFORE NO FREE WILLIAM
THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM WITH IF A PERSON HAS FREE WILL BECAUSE THEY ARE A UNIT SET THAT COMPRISES ANY NUMBER OF QUALITIES RELATING TO CAUSATION THEN THE COMPATIBILITY IS RECONCILED BY THE FACT THAT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PERSON AND ANY OTHER UNIT SET IS AN ARBITRARY ONE SO NOW THE FREE WILL HAS BEEN SOUGHT BY ERRONEOUSLY CONFLATING THE ORIGIN OF THE FREE WILL WITH THE PERSON THEN A PERSON ACCURATELY CATEGORIZED IN A MATERIALISTIC WAY THEN NATURAL QUALITIES OF MATERIALISM ARE EXTENDED TO FREE WILL ACCIDENTALLY GENERALIZING FREE WILL TO ANY AND ALL SETS OF REAL MATERIAL PHENOMENA SO FREE WILL IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL TITLE GIVEN TO A POTENTIAL ACTION THAT ULTIMATELY HAPPENS IT FEELS LIKE BEGGING THE QUESTION FREE WILL IS WHAT PEOPLE DO BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE DO IS FREE WILL AND WE'LL JUST AVOID THE FREE WILL THAT THE MOON EXERTS ON THE TIDES NOW IT'S ALL SOPHISTIC ATTEMPTING TO FIND ROOM FOR AN ILLUSION OF THE BRAIN IN NATURE AS IT APPEARS IN THE BRAIN SURE WE'VE BEEN STRICT ABOUT EXTENSIONS AND GENERALIZATION BUT YOU KNOW THE RESULT IS EITHER A REDUCTIVE PROPOSITION OR SOMEONE IS WALKING AWAY FEELING ASSURED THAT THEY HAVE A SOUL RAZOR THEN WE HAVE PROPERLY SUPPORTED CAUSALITY WITHOUT THE MAGICAL SUGGESTION

THIS IS WHY ETHICS IS ULTIMATELY A RHETORICAL DISCIPLINE AND TO THAT END ETHICS WILL LIKELY ALWAYS BE RELEVANT BECAUSE THE MARGIN OF ACTUAL DETERMINABILITY IS LIKELY TO ALWAYS EXIST INFINITESIMAL AS IT COULD BECOME STILL IT IS FRUITLESS ALBEIT ENTERTAINING TO DISCUSS COMPATIBILITY EXCEPT TO DISCOVER THE RHETORICAL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF POSITIONS COMPLEMENTARY TO EFFECTUALLY HELD BELIEFS I DON'T SEE THAT THE RESPECT OF A PHILOSOPHICAL KIND SHOULD NECESSARILY BE GIVEN RHETORICALLY POWERFUL POSITIONS AND FREE WILL IS NO EXCEPTION
CAUSE AND EFFECT NEGATES FREE WILLIAM
FREE WILL IS UNDERSTOOD AS

SURE

IN ORDER TO SAY THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO ACT BY PRIOR CAUSES WE HAVE TO SAY THAT THESE CAUSES ARE EXTERNAL TO YOU

OKAY WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE CAUSES AS EXTERNAL

BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS SEEM TO BE THE CASE

WHY NOT AS YOU SAID

IF WE SUPPOSE DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN YOU JUST ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRIOR CAUSES ALL THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE CERTAIN BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES AND SO ON

WOULDN'T INCOMPATIBILISTS CORRECT YOUR STATEMENT HERE
YOU ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE RESULTS FROM WHOLE BUNCH OF PRIOR EXTERNAL CAUSES CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHY THOSE PRIOR CAUSES ARE NOT EXTERNAL I DO NOT SEE ANY SUPPORT IN YOUR ARGUMENT YOU MENTIONED PRIOR CAUSES SUCH AS GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS BUT AREN'T THOSE COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD AS EXTERNAL FACTORS

SO IF YOU CHOOSE WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THESE FORCE YOU TO CHOOSE THESE THINGS ARE INTRINSIC TO AND CONSTITUTIVE OF YOU NOT EXTERNAL TO YOU

IF HAVE YOU ESTABLISHED THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY CHOOSE

TL R

YOU HAVE A DEFINITION OF FREEWILL THAT IS BASED ON CHOICE AND EXTERNAL FORCE YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD BE MORE CONVINCING IF YOU ELABORATE ON WHY ALL PRIOR CAUSES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE EXTERNAL AND 2 PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE
DO WE REALLY NEED FREE WILL FOR OUR CHOICES TO BE IM MORAL WHY DEFINE MORALITY BY COMPARING OUR ACTIONS TO WHAT WE COULD AND SHOULD DO RATHER THAN COMPARING THEM TO THE IDEAL WAY REGARDLESS OF OUR ABILITY OF CHOOSING WHAT WE DO LIKE IN A PUPPET THEATRE WHERE THERE ARE ALSO BAD GUYS AND GOOD GUYS THE PUPPETS ARE OF COURSE NOT REALLY CAPABLE OF MORALITY BUT AS WE IMMERSE OURSELVES IN THE PLAY WE PRETEND THEY ARE DETERMINISM AND THE ILLUSION OF FREE WILL AND MORALITY DON'T CONFLICT AS LONG AS WE ACCEPT BOTH PERSPECTIVES THAT OF THE PUPPET THAT OF THE PRAGMATIC AUDIENCE AS COMPLEMENTARY NOT CONTRADICTORY
YOUR ARGUMENT ISN'T AS STRONG AS SOME OTHER ARGUMENTS FOR COMPATIBLISM BECAUSE IT RELIES ON AN INTERNAL EXTERNAL DISTINCTION THAT IS VERY VAGUE WE HAVEN'T REALLY SOLVED THE MIND BODY PROBLEM YET SOME PEOPLE THINK WE HAVEN'T EVEN SOLVED THE BODY PROBLEM YET TO SAY THAT THESE FACTORS THAT MAKE UP THE CAUSES FOR YOUR DECISIONS ARE INTERNAL AND THEREFORE YOU JUST BEGS THE QUESTION OF WHAT YOU ARE IS THE BUTTERFLY THAT DREW YOUR FATHER'S ATTENTION TO YOUR MOTHER AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF YOUR CONCEPTION YOU AT SOME POINT THE EXTERNAL BECOMES THE INTERNAL AND YOUR ARGUMENT BREAKS DOWN
IF DETERMINISM IS TRUE THERE IS NO POINT IN DEBATING WHAT IS MORAL BECAUSE IT WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING IF WE KNOW OR DON'T KNOW WHAT IS MORAL THEN AGAIN IF DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN IT IS ALREADY DECIDED IF WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS MORAL SO THERE IS NO POINT IN DEBATING IF WE SHOULD TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT
IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS NO DISCREET SINGLE PERSON ANYMORE AND WE'RE MOVING INTO SOME KIND OF BUDDHIST OR HINDU PHILOSOPHY
I THINK WHETHER A CHOICE IS FREE AND WHETHER IT'S WORTHY OF BLAME LEGAL PENALTIES ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS TO ACT AS A DETERRENT TO CERTAIN BEHAVIOR FOR THE GOOD OF SOCIETY THAT DETERRENT IS USEFUL TO SOCIETY REGARDLESS OF THE DETERMINISM OR FREE WILL HYPOTHESES

DETERMINING FREEDOM SEEMS LIKE MORE OF AN INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE FOR THE SAKE OF PURSUING PHILOSOPHY
IN ORDER TO SAY THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO ACT BY PRIOR CAUSES WE HAVE TO SAY THAT THESE CAUSES ARE EXTERNAL TO YOU

NOTE BELOW I USE ATOMS LOOSELY HERE PHYSICISTS CAN SUBSTITUTE GLUONS AND BOSONS WHERE I SPECIFY ATOMS

EVERYTHING IS ATOMS PEOPLE ARE ATOMS WHEN YOU SAY THE UNIVERSE IS DETERMINISTIC YOU ARE QUITE SPECIFICALLY CLAIMING THAT ATOMS ARE DETERMINISTIC

IF ATOMS ARE DETERMINISTIC I DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE BUT HERE YOU ARE STIPULATING THEY ARE THEN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL ARE ILL-DEFINED EAST G YOUR BODY IS MADE UP OF AN ALMOST ENTIRELY DIFFERENT COLLECTION OF ATOMS NOW THAN IT WAS A YEAR AGO WHAT'S EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL THE DISTINCTION IS MEANINGLESS AT THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR ASSUMED DETERMINISM ATOMS

IN A DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE ALL THAT EXISTS ARE THESE DETERMINISTIC ATOMS INTERACTING THE ATOMS THAT MAKE UP YOUR BODY UNDERGO DETERMINISTIC FORCES RESULTING IN A COMPLEX BUT ULTIMATELY DETERMINISTIC CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH MAKES DETERMINISTIC DECISIONS FREE WILL IS PERCEIVED BUT ULTIMATELY THE UNIVERSE FOLLOWS A DETERMINISTIC COURSE

NOTE FROM A MORAL STANDPOINT IT'S MOSTLY UNIMPORTANT I EAST IF THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS WAS SHOWN TO BE ABSOLUTELY TRUE TOMORROW I EAST ATOMS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY PROBABILITY WAVE FUNCTIONS COLLAPSING SOCIETY WOULD NOT SUDDENLY STOP PUNISHING MURDERERS
YOU SORT OF ACKNOWLEDGED THIS BUT YOUR DEFINITION OF FREE WILL IS NOT WHAT THE REST OF US ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I THINK MOST DETERMINISM VERB FREE WILL DEBATES ARE JUST SEMANTICS

WHY NOT JUST GO WITH THE WEBSTER DEFINITIONS

THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE HOW TO ACT

OR

THE ABILITY TO MAKE CHOICES THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY FATE OR GOD

EITHER OF THESE ARE MUCH MORE ON POINT THAN THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

IF WE MAKE A CHOICE BUT IT TURNS OUT WE WERE FORCED TO MAKE THIS CHOICE BY SOMEONE OR SOMETHING ELSE THEN WE CAN'T BE BLAMED OR PRAISED FOR THAT CHOICE

HERE I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THE KEYWORDS HERE ARE SOMEONE OR SOMETHING ELSE DETERMINISM DOES NOT HOLD THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS FORCED INTO ACTION BY THINGS OUTSIDE YOUR OWN BRAIN I MEAN IN THE ULTIMATE SENSE YOU ARE SINCE YOUR BRAIN IS THE PRODUCT OF OUTSIDE THINGS BUT YOUR BRAIN IS ONE OF THE MOST DIRECT SOURCES OF YOUR DETERMINISTIC NATURE IT'S NOT OUTSIDE THE DETERMINING FORCES IT'S ONE OF THEM THAT CAN BE IMPORTANT TO NOTE DEPENDING ON THE ARGUMENTS BEING MADE

IF WE SUPPOSE DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN YOU JUST ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRIOR CAUSES ALL THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE CERTAIN BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES AND SO ON

RIGHT WITH YOU SO FAR

SO IF YOU CHOOSE WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THESE FORCE YOU TO CHOOSE THESE THINGS ARE INTRINSIC TO AND CONSTITUTIVE OF YOU NOT EXTERNAL TO YOU

AND YOU LOST ME WEREN'T WE JUST ASSUMING DETERMINISM IS TRUE THERE IS NO CHOOSE IF DETERMINISM IS TRUE THE WHOLE POINT IS CHOICES ARE ILLUSIONS YOU ASSUME BOTH CHOICES AND DETERMINISM ARE REAL IN YOUR CONCLUSION TOO AND IT JUST LOOKS PARADOXICAL TO ME

IF I INJECT A PROBE INTO YOUR BRAIN AND STIMULATE CERTAIN NEURONS OR WHATEVER AND THIS CAUSES YOU TO DO SOMETHING THEN THIS IS HARDLY A BELIEF VALUE DESIRE OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IS INTRINSIC TO YOU BUT THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE FREE WILLIAM

I DISAGREE I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT PROVES WE DON'T HAVE FREE WILLIAM A BRAIN IS SUBJECT TO PHYSICAL FORCES LIKE ANYTHING ELSE YOU DON'T GET TO CHOOSE ANYTHING EVER YOU SIMPLY DO THINGS ACCORDING TO YOUR EXACT BRAIN STATE AT THAT MOMENT UNLESS YOU SIMPLY DEFINE CHOICE AS CONSCIOUS BRAIN FUNCTION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IF WE SUPPOSE DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN YOU JUST ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRIOR CAUSES ALL THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE CERTAIN BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES AND SO ON SO IF YOU CHOOSE

HERE IS YOUR MISTAKE YOU SAY WE CHOOSE THEREFORE YOU SAY
IF A IS TRUE A IS TRUE
THE THING IS IF DETERMINISM IS TRUE WE DONT CHOOSE WE JUST
DO WHAT WE ARE DESTINED TO DO
DELETED
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FREE WILLIAM EVERYTHING COSTS SOMETHING
IF WE SUPPOSE DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN YOU JUST ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRIOR CAUSES ALL THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE CERTAIN BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES AND SO ON SO IF YOU CHOOSE WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THESE FORCE YOU TO CHOOSE THESE THINGS ARE INTRINSIC TO AND CONSTITUTIVE OF YOU NOT EXTERNAL TO YOU

BY THIS DEFINITION YOU IS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE PRIOR CAUSES AFTER PRIOR CAUSES AFTER PRIOR CAUSES IT IS NONSENSICAL IN THE WAY WE HUMANS USE THE TERM YOU TO DESCRIBE INDIVIDUAL HUMANS AND NOT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE ALL CONCLUSIONS YOU DRAW FROM THIS YOU DO NOT REFLECT HUMANS INDIVIDUAL HUMANS
THOUGH NOT LOGICALLY INCONSISTENT IT'S A WHOLE LOT OF HAND WAVING IF YOU ASK ME YOU EXPLAIN DETERMINISM SO SOUNDLY TO A LOGICAL CONCLUSION THEN SEEK A WAY OUT ALTHOUGH I FIND THIS QUESTION ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING ONES OF OUR TIME SERIOUSLY WHO CARES IF WE DO OR NOT MOST OF THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS WE DON'T BUT THAT DOESN'T HAVE PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN OUR CURRENT SOCIETY I SAY PRETEND LIKE YOU DO BUT DON'T FORGET THAT YOU DON'T

THOUGH SERIOUSLY LITERALLY MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF LIFE FORMS IN THE HISTORY OF CREATION ALL ACTING ON THE CONFLUENCE OF GENES ENVIRONMENT AND INSTINCT AND OH YEAH IT'S JUST US WITH THE FREE WILLIAM
ISN'T THIS A FLAWED ARGUMENT SINCE THERE IS NO FREEDOM OF ANY KIND IN TOTAL DETERMINISM AND THE THINGS WE CALL BELIEFS ARE SIMPLY A SYSTEM OF CAUSES BASICALLY THAT WE DON'T FORM BELIEFS AND ARE ONLY A FUNCTION OF STIMULI OR CAUSES EFFECTING AN OUTCOME I EAST MY IDEA OF MORALITY IS SIMPLY A SERIES OF NEURONS THAT FIRED IN THE RIGHT WAY GIVEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS AS SUCH I AM A MACHINE MY SELF IS SIMPLY A STRICT PROGRESSION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT AS SUCH I HAVE NO FREE WILL CULPABILITY BASICALLY IF MY SELF IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE CONTROL OF AN ESSENCE SOMETHING THAT TRANSCENDS THE CAUSAL UNIVERSE THEN WHAT I CANNOT HAVE AGENCY AND MY ONLY FREEDOM IS THE FREEDOM FROM OBSTRUCTION AND EVEN THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A CAUSE TO AN EFFECT IN BEHAVIOR
I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT WHAT LITTLE I CAN UNDERSTAND SEEMS TO BE QUITE OBVIOUSLY INCORRECT TO ME

IF MY INTERPRETATION WAS CORRECT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE SELF IS THE SAME AS THE INTRINSIC VALUES THAT DETERMINISM HOLDS TO DETERMINE ONE'S ACTIONS

THEREFORE YOU PROPOSE WE DO HAVE FREE WILL AS YOU ARE YOUR VALUES AND YOUR VALUES CAN CHOOSE WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU NEXT

BUT THE THING ABOUT DETERMINISM IS THOSE VALUES ARE ULTIMATELY NOT FROM YOU THEY'RE FROM EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING ELSE AN ARGUMENT THAT I DON'T THINK IS REALLY ADDRESSED HERE

FOR INSTANCE LET'S SAY THAT I AM BORN IN A WESTERN COUNTRY WHERE I AM INDOCTRINATED FROM YOUTH IN WESTERN VALUES HOW MUCH OF THOSE VALUES DID I ACTUALLY CHOOSE TO TAKE UP AND HOW MUCH OF THEM WERE NORMALIZED OR TRAINED INTO ME IF WE CAN SAY THAT THOSE VALUES TAKE A PART IN MY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS THEN IT IS NOT TRUE THAT I AM THE ONE WHO DECIDES IT IS THE WESTERN VALUES EXTRINSIC TO ME WHICH WERE INDOCTRINATED INTO ME THAT IS MAKING THAT CHOICE

THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE A DENIAL OF RESPONSIBILITY YOU MIGHT ARGUE THAT I COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO REJECT THOSE VALUES IF I SO FELT LIKE IT BUT LET'S TAKE THE ARGUMENT A STEP FURTHER TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN OF REJECTION WHAT IF IT WASN'T INDOCTRINATION OF VALUES BUT A MENTAL CONDITION THAT I AM BORN WITH

LET'S SAY THAT THIS TIME INSTEAD OF BEING BORN IN A WESTERN SOCIETY I AM BORN WITH A MENTAL CONDITION CAUSING PSYCHOSIS I CANNOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT THIS IS AN INFLUENCE ON MY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS BUT PSYCHOSIS BY YOUR ARGUMENT IS ARGUED TO BE A PART OF ME AND THUS THE DECISIONS I MAKE DURING PSYCHOTIC EPISODES ARE ALSO ME THUS IT CAN BE SAID THAT EVEN IF I'M SUFFERING FROM A PSYCHOTIC EPISODE I HAVE FREE WILLIAM

HOWEVER LET'S CONSIDER IT FURTHER LET'S SAY I AM UNDER THE BELIEF THAT A BOY HAS RUN ACROSS THE ROAD IN FRONT OF MY CAR CAUSING ME TO LOSE CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE AND CRASH IF I HAD KNOWN THAT THE BOY WASN'T REAL WOULD I HAVE CHOSEN TO GET CRASH INTO A TREE OUT OF MY OWN FREE WILL BY YOUR ARGUMENT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT SINCE THE MENTAL CONDITION IS A PART OF ME IT WAS STILL ME WHO MADE THE DECISION TO CRASH OUT OF MY OWN INFORMED FREE WILLIAM BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS THE CASE IT WASN'T A DECISION THAT I WOULD HAVE TAKEN IF I HAD RECEIVED TRUE INFORMATION ABOUT MY SURROUNDINGS I WAS DECEIVED INTO MAKING THE DECISION TO CRASH THROUGH A MENTAL DISEASE AND CLEARLY IN THAT INSTANCE HAD NO INFORMED FREE WILL OVER WHETHER TO CRASH OR NOT

I SIMPLY DON'T SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CASE BELOW AND THE CASE ABOVE IN BOTH CASES ONE'S DECISIONS WAS IMPAIRED BY FACTORS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL I SUPPOSE YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE DOCTORIZATION AND THE MENTAL ILLNESS ARE BOTH A PART OF THE SELF AND THAT THUS THE SELF STILL ULTIMATELY HAS FREE WILL BUT I WOULD QUESTION HOW MUCH OF THE SELF IS ACTUALLY THE SELF IF THAT WAS THE CASE

GENERALLY I JUST DON'T THINK IT IS TRUE THAT FREE WILL AND DETERMINISM CAN CO-EXIST REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS OR IS NOT DEFINED AS A PART OF YOU
THE YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE MADE UP THE WAY IT IS WHETHER IT IS ARBITRARILY DEEMED INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL SO I DON'T SEE HOW YOUR IDEA GIVES US A FREE WILL THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE AT ALL

ALSO I THINK YOU HAVE A PIECE OF LOGIC BACKWARDS IT ISN'T RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR ACTIONS THAT MEANS WE HAVE FREE WILL IT IS HAVING FREE WILL THAT MEANS WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS
I USUALLY THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM BEST TURNED UP SIDE DOWN

IF I HAVE NO FREE WILL THEN WHY ARE THERE COMPANIES SPENDING BILLIONS OF INSERT LOCAL CURRENCY HERE S TO INFLUENCE IT TO BUY SOMETHING I DON'T REALLY NEED OR VOTE FOR SOMEONE I DON'T REALLY TRUST
LOOK SO FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND THE UNIVERSE ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO THIS THING CALLED FREE WILL AND TRUE AGENCY SIMPLY JUST DOESN'T EXIST THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE SEEM TO THINK OURSELVES AS EXCEPTIONS TO THIS WHOLE UNIVERSE BEHAVING IN AN ORDERLY WAY KINDA DEAL SO FAR AS WE KNOW WE DON'T FUNCTION IN ANY OTHER FUNDAMENTAL WAY THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE WHETHER IT BE A DOG CAT ROCK OR SUPER INTELLIGENT AI THERE ARE RULES HERE PEOPLE REALLY NEED MOVE ON TO HOW WE BEST UNDERSTAND THIS ASPECT OF LIFE AND HOW WE CAN USE IT TO BETTER OUR WORLD
VERY OUTSIDE OF MY NORMAL AREA OF CONSIDERATION SO PARDON ANY IGNORANCE


WOULDNT DETERMINISTIC WILL MAKE US MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS THAN HAVING FREE WILL RESPONSIBLE NOT AS A QUALITY OF CHOICE BUT THAT OF PREDETERMINED AND UNMUTABLE CAUSE AND EFFECT


WATER IS WET AND THUS WILL ALWAYS BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING THIS WET AS IT TOUCHES THEM THERE IS NO CHOICE AND ALWAYS DIRECT CONSEQUENCE
HUMANS CAN CAUSE SAY CLIMATE CHANGE BUT ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE AS ITS NOT A CONSTANT OUTCOME OF HUMANS
UNSURE IF EXPRESSING THE IDEA CORRECTLY OR AM BEING STUCK ON A SEMANTIC CHOICE FOR RESPONSIBLE
IF WE SUPPOSE DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN YOU JUST ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PRIOR CAUSES ALL THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE CERTAIN BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES AND SO ON SO IF YOU CHOOSE WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT THESE FORCE YOU TO CHOOSE

THE BIT I'VE BOLDED IT'S THE FOUNDATION OF YOUR ARGUMENT AND IT'S PURE ASSERTION
IN TERMS OF PUNISHMENT

YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT BACKWARDS AS A DETERMINIST MORAL RESPONSIBILITY ISN'T NECESSARILY PUNISH THOSE WHO HAVE DONE WRONG WE ASSIGN PEOPLE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PUNISH THEM SO THEY CAN BE INFLUENCED TO COURSE CORRECT AS SOCIETY STILL HOLDS FREE WILL TO BE TRUE SO SOMETIMES THIS ISNT DONE WELL A DETERMINISTIC APPROACH ISN'T A FATALISTIC APPROACH IN FACT BECAUSE WE KNOW PEOPLE AREN'T CLOSED STATIC SYSTEMS WE HAVE A MORE POSITIVE VIEW OF REHABILITATION
YES THUS WE ARE ABLE TO DRAW A CONCEPTUAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN BEING FORCED TO ACT BY SOME EXTERNAL AGENT A GUN TO THE HEAD PERHAPS AND BEING FREE TO ACT ACCORDING TO OUR OWN PREFERENCES DESIRES INCLINATIONS WHAT YOU WILLIAM HOWEVER YOUR CLAIM THAT YOU IS ACCORDING TO DETERMINISM JUST THE BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES AND SO ON MISREPRESENTS THE DETERMINIST POSITION A DETERMINIST CAN PROPOSE THAT YOU BY WHICH YOU SEEM TO MEAN PERSONAL IDENTITY IS OUR CONSCIOUS AWARENESS OF OUR BELIEFS VALUES DESIRES ETC THUS DESIRE A PERHAPS A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION FOR SWEET THINGS MIGHT BE IN CONFLICT WITH DESIRE B LET US SAY A CONDITIONED CONCERN FROM OUR UPBRINGING THAT SWEET THINGS ARE TO BE AVOIDED BECAUSE THEY WILL MAKE US FAT IN THIS SITUATION DESIRES A AND B ARE INDEED EXTERNAL TO YOU AND ACT IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS A GUN TO THE HEAD ALBEIT WITH LESS COMPELLING FORCE THE DETERMINIST HOLDS THAT WHICHEVER DESIRE YOU DO END UP ACTING UPON IS INEVITABLE AND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE AND THAT FREEWILL IS AN ILLUSION CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE COMPETING DESIRES IMPINGING UPON OUR CONSCIOUSNESS PERSONAL IDENTITY I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T ERODE THIS POSITION SIMPLY BY OFFERING AN INCOMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT MAKES YOU YOU
IGNORING THE FLAWED CONCEPT OF LANGUAGE ABSTRACTION THERE IS ONLY ONE REALITY OF THE PAST PRESENT FUTURE HARD DETERMINISM IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THERE ARE MULTIPLE REALITIES IN EITHER PAST PRESENT OR FUTURE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU TRY TO BEND THE SEMANTICS

WE CAN CHANGE THE MEANING OF WORDS LIKE WILL SELF CHOICE OPTIONS AND MANY MORE MANY OF THESE RHETORIC ACROBATICS WILL MAKE IT HARDER OR EASIER TO DETECT CERTAIN INCOHERENCE IN BETWEEN BUT IF REALITY IS BELIEVED TO BE SINGULAR IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM THAN THE COMMON ABSTRACT INTERPRETATIONS DEFINITIONS OF GUILT RESPONSIBILITY PRIDE AND MANY MORE GO OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THAT POINT
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE USEFUL PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVE DEFINITIONS INTERPRETATIONS OF THOSE CONCEPTS

EITHER WAY A MORE THOROUGH ARGUMENT ABOUT MY POSITION WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE OUT OF SCOPE FOR REDDIN AS MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE SO I LL LEAVE IT AT THIS SPOILER A THOROUGH ANALYSIS WOULD ALSO LEAD TO THE INEVITABLE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE KNOWLEDGE TO BE FOUND ON THIS OR ANY OTHER MATTER
THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY SOPHISTICATED DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO CLING TO THE NOTION OF FREE WILLIAM WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE FREE WILL IS IT JUST SO THAT WE CAN HOLD PEOPLE MORALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS CAN'T WE ACT AS IF WE HAVE FREE WILL EVEN IF WE DON'T IF SO FEAR OF CONSEQUENCES CAN STILL BE ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINES BEHAVIOR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S FAIR TO FACE CONSEQUENCES FOR ACTIONS WITHOUT HAVING MORAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE ACTIONS IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION IS LIFE FAIR
THIS ARGUMENT IS PRETTY WEAK
IF YOU CHARACTERIZE DETERMINISM AT THE QUANTUM LEVEL I EAST PARTICLE BEHAVIOR FREE WILL BECOMES A FUNCTION OF QUANTUM STATISTICS IT MAY ONE DAY BE TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR MANIPULATE THE OUTCOME OF THESE PSEUDORANDOM PARTICLE INTERACTIONS I SAY PSEUDO BECAUSE TRUE RANDOMNESS DOES NOT EXIST IN THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE
I WOULD NOT TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSES A CHOICE AND DERIVE FROM THAT FREE WILL BUT TO SEE THAT CHOICES HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND THOSE CONSEQUENCES LEAD TO DIFFERENT OUTCOMES IN THE FUTURE THAT COULD CHANGE EASILY A PREDETERMINED HISTORY WITH THE FORCE OF THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT CHAOS THEORY

IF THAT IS NOT ENOUGH JUST TRY TO EXPLAIN WHETHER TRUMAN HAD A FREE WILL TO CHOOSE THE OPTIONS THAT LED TO NUKING JAPAN OR NOT HIS DECESSION INFLUENCED SO MANY PEOPLES LIVES THAT YOU CAN HARDLY ARGUE THAT HIS CHOICE DID NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME OF A PREDETERMINED FUTURE IF IT WAS DETERMINED THAT JUST ONE OF THOSE JAPANESE WHO DIED WOULD FIND A CURE FOR CANCER THEN THAT DETERMINATION WAS BROKEN BY A MANS FREE WILL DECESSION IF IT WAS DETERMINED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE WOULD DIE THEN TRUMAN HAD NOT A FREE WILL IN THE FIRST PLACE HIS DECESSION AND THE ABSENCE OF A FREE CHOICE WERE PREDETERMINED TO BEGIN WITH SO EVERY PREDETERMINED OCCURENCE IN THE FUTURE WOULD BECOME TRUE
I LIKE THIS FOR ME DETERMINISM IS A PLATFORM FOR MAKING RELIABLE DECISIONS I THINK THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN HARD DETERMINISM AND FATALISM

FRANKFURT CASES CAN BE CONSIDERED VALID
MY THING HAS ALWAYS BEEN IF DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN APPARENTLY WE HAVE THE PERFECT ILLUSION OF FREE WILL AND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FREE WILL AND THE PERFECT ILLUSION OF FREE WILL

BUT I LIKE YOUR ARGUMENT IT'S VERY THOUGHT-PROVOKING
YOU AREN'T THE CAUSES YOU ARE SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF THE CAUSES
COMPATIBILISTS GONNA COMPATIBILIST MUST BE EASY TO BE IN DENIAL OF THE FULL IMPLICATIONS OF CAUSAL DETERMINISM WHEN IT IS FIRST REQUIRED THAT YOU'RE IN DENIAL OF YOUR OWN SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF FREE WILLIAM

SLIGHTLY MORE DIFFICULT IN THIS SHITSTORM OF DENIAL IS TO RECONCILE THE PRAGMATIC BENEFITS OF BELIEVING IN A FREE WILL THAT IS NEITHER CAUSAL NOR RANDOM IF IT BE AN ILLUSION OF WHAT PRAGMATIC BENEFIT WOULD BE IN ITS BELIEF AT THIS DIFFICULT JUNCTURE DETERMINISTS AND COMPATIBILISTS ALIKE MUST BE HUMBLED
IT WILL BE HARD TO ARGUE WITH THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE BRAIN WORKS THE UNDERLYING AND ELECTRICAL INTERACTIONS THAT HAPPEN ARE NOT FREE TO CHOOSE EVEN IF WE INCLUDE THE STOP SIGNALS THAT CAN BE PRODUCED BY CONSCIOUSNESS THAT'S ALSO IS DETERMINED BY INTERNAL EXTERNAL FACTORS

MY CHOICE TO REPLY ISN'T REALLY A CHOICE THERE ARE TIME WHERE I WON'T REPLY AND THAT ISN'T REALLY A CHOICE EITHER IT'S JUST THE CONDITION AND FORMATION OF MY BRAIN IT'S CURRENT STATE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT DETERMINE WHAT I WILL OR WILL NOT DO IN VERY SPECIFIC CONDITIONS

FROM A MORAL PERSPECTIVE IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE STOP USING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IT'S JUST DIFFICULT TO ASSERT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS ACTIONS WE STILL HAVE TO DETERMINE IF THIS PERSON HAS THE CAPABILITY TO REHABILITATE AND FUNCTION IN SOCIETY IT CHANGES FROM PUNISHMENT TO SOME PEOPLE WILL GIVE THE INDICATION THAT IT'S UNLIKELY TO CHANGE AND HENCE FORTH NEED TO BE SEPARATED FROM SOCIETY AND LOOKED AFTER DIFFERENTLY

I THINK ONE OF THE FEARS OF HAVING SOCIETAL ACCEPTANCE OF THIS VIEW IS THAT SYSTEMS WOULD BE ELIMINATED BECAUSE OF MORAL IMPLICATIONS BUT I THINK THEY WOULD JUST CHANGE TO ADDRESS THE NEW UNDERSTANDING WE WOULD STILL NEED THESE ELEMENTS IN SOCIETY BUT THEY MIGHT JUST NEED TO BE TO FIT WITH THE NEW UNDERSTANDING

PEOPLE WILL NOT LIKE BEING COMPARED TO ANIMALS BUT WE DON'T PARTICULAR BLAME DOGS WHEN THEY COMMIT VARIOUS ACTIONS LIKE BITING SOMEONE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DO ACT ON THOSE OCCURRENCES WE REMOVE THEM FROM OUR ENVIRONMENT WE DON'T JUST LET THE DOG FREE I AM NOT SUGGESTING WE GO EXACT SAME ROUTE BECAUSE I BELIEVE MOST DOGS ARE PUT DOWN AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE DON'T TAKE CHANCES BUT IT WOULD BE A SIMILAR IDEA IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT WE SEE EVIDENCE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN BE REHABILITATED OR NOT

IT WILL BE FAR MORE CHALLENGING FOR SURE BUT UNLESS WE GAIN A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE BRAIN AND THAT NEW INFORMATION LEADS TO US HAVING FREE WILL THEN IT'S PROBABLY THE PATH WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS



THESE THINGS ARE INTRINSIC AND CONSTITUTIVE OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE SHE CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK FIRST WHETHER YOU REALLY NEED A FREE WILL TO BE MORALLY RESPONSIBLE THE WORK OF PAGE FOLIO STRAWSON AND G WATSON ARE INTERESTING REGARDING THAT QUESTION
ESPECIALLY HAVE A LOOK AT FREEDOM AND RESENTMENT
SO WE ARE GIVEN DETERMINISM THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THESE PRIOR CAUSES AND THEREFORE THEY DO NOT FORCE US TO CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE US

I THINK THIS POINT IS WHERE THE DETERMINIST WOULD DISAGREE ARGUMENT ISN'T NECESSARILY CONCERNED WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CAUSES THEY'RE JUST SEEN AS CAUSES TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE MAIN ARGUMENT FOR DETERMINISM GOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS

CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXISTENCE AND WORKINGS OF THE BRAIN

2 THE BRAIN AND IT'S WORKINGS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSCIOUSNESS

THEREFORE CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSCIOUSNESS

IT'S IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE WORDS CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ARGUMENT CHEMICAL REACTIONS IS DEFINED AS NATURALLY PREDETERMINED ACTIONS AS A RESULT OF OTHER ACTIONS OR STIMULI THIS GIVES CHEMICAL REACTIONS THE QUALITY OF BEING DETERMINISTIC TO BE CAUSED BY CHEMICAL REACTIONS IS TO HAVE BEEN DETERMINED ALSO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS INTEGRAL TO OUR IDENTITY AND ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS AS BEING CONSCIOUS IS A PREREQUISITE TO MAKE DECISIONS SO FOLLOWING THIS

CHEMICAL REACTIONS ARE DETERMINISTIC

THEREFORE CONSCIOUSNESS IS DETERMINISTIC

I'VE BEEN WRITING THIS OFF AND ON FOR THE PAST HOUR OR SO AT WORK SO MY APOLOGIES IF THIS IS KINDA SHORT OR NOT SO WELL PUT TOGETHER THE TWO PROBLEMS WITH THIS ARGUMENT ARE THE PROBLEM OF THE FIRST MOVER WHAT CAUSED THE FIRST ACTION AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE DON'T TOTALLY KNOW HOW CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS I THINK IT'S MOST REASONABLE TO BE A SOFT DETERMINIST WITH THESE PROBLEMS IN MIND

ALSO THE DENIAL OF ACRASIA PROTAGORAS IS PRETTY INTERESTING IN RELATION TO THIS ARGUMENT
MINOR YOUR LIBERTARIANS VERY MUCH HAVE TO DO WITH THE POLITICAL POSITION LIBERTARIANISM AS A POLITICAL VIEW IS BASED ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE FREE WILL AND DETERMINE THEIR OWN LIVES DESTINY

BUT TO YOUR MAIN POINT IT SEEMS A TAUTOLOGY YOU ACCEPT CHOICE AS BEING REAL AND YOU DEFINE PEOPLE AS THINGS THAT MAKE CHOICES THAT'S WHERE IT GOES AWRY

BUT ALSO YOUR PRIMARY CONCLUSION SO WE ARE GIVEN DETERMINISM THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THESE PRIOR CAUSES AND THEREFORE THEY DO NOT FORCE US TO CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE US AND THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE WE DO HAVE FREE WILLIAM

TO ME THIS SEEMS ILLOGICAL IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT PRIOR CAUSES DO NOT DETERMINE US BECAUSE THEY ARE US
I DON'T AGREE THAT MORAL RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE DISCUSSED DIRECTLY IN A DETERMINISTIC FRAMEWORK TO REGARD OF FREE WILL AS IF RESPONSIBILITY IS DIRECTLY LINKED WITH FREE WILLIAM

ONE SHOULD HAVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE CONTEXT OF HUMAN AND HOW IT IS AFFECTED DETERMINISICLY BY THOUGHTS AND OUTSIDE INFLUENCES
APPARENTLY I DIDNT GET MY POINT ACROSS VERY WELL I PROPOSED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CULTURES USE THE TERM OR THE EQUIVALENT OF CHOICE IN THEIR LANGUAGE IN A WAY THAT MEANS YOU HAVE MULTIPLE OPTIONS THAT ARE SOMEHOW ALL POSSIBLE CANNOT BE IN A DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE AND NOT JUST DECORATION THAT DISTRACT FROM THE FACT THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE CHOICE OPTION TO BEGIN WITH
A MORE LOGICAL APPROACH IS POINTING OUT THAT YOU CAN ONLY CHOOSE BETWEEN THINGS IF THERE IS ONLY ONE OPTION THERE IS PER DEFINITION NO CHOICE AND ALSO NO OPTION BECAUSE WE CALL EVENTS THAT INVOLVE NO CHOICE CONSEQUENCES AND NOT OPTIONS SO IF ALL THE OTHER OPTIONS WERE PER DEFINITION DETERMINISM NO REAL OPTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE THAN THERE WAS ALSO PER DEFINITION NO CHOICE
CHOICE CHOICE INVOLVES DECISION MAKING IT CAN INCLUDE JUDGING THE MERITS OF MULTIPLE OPTIONS AND SELECTING ONE OR MORE OF THEM ONE CAN MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN IMAGINED OPTIONS WHAT WOULD I DO IF OR BETWEEN REAL OPTIONS FOLLOWED BY THE CORRESPONDING ACTION
THE IMPORTANT PART HERE IS OF MULTIPLE OPTIONS
OPTIONS A THING THAT IS OR MAY BE CHOSEN
THE IMPORTANT PART HERE IS IS OR MAY BE CHOSEN SO IT NEEDS TO BE ACTUALLY POSSIBLE TO CHOOSE SOMETHING FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED AN OPTION
SELECTING IF YOU THEN SEARCH FOR DEFINITION OF SELECTING YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS DEFINED AS CAREFULLY CHOOSE AS BEING THE BEST OR MOST SUITABLE A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND BORING CIRCLE OF TWO DEFINITIONS THAT POINT TOWARDS EACH OTHER
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE IS NO GOOD WAY OR OFFICIAL SOURCE DEFINITION TO PROVE OR ARGUE FOR MY PROPOSAL OUTSIDE OF SOCIAL STUDIES AND STATISTICS
BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE DOES NOT USE THE WORD CHOOSE OR OPTION WHEN THEY DESCRIBE A SITUATION WITH ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOME THE BIGGEST EXCEPTION TO THIS IS A SMALL ABBREVIATION THAT PEOPLE USE
I HAD NO CHOICE VS I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE
I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE FIRST ONE IS CORRECT IN TERMS OF SEMANTICS AND THE SECOND ONE IS A CONTRADICTION INSIDE THE LANGUAGE IF THERE WAS ONLY OUTCOME THAN THERE WAS NEITHER A CHOICE NOR ANY OPTION
THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR THERE WAS ONLY ONE OPTION
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED HOW THESE INCOHERENT PHRASES DEVELOPED IN THE FIRST PLACE ITS BECAUSE OF THE OFTEN PRESENT OPTION TO DO NOTHING IN MOST CASES PEOPLE PERCEIVE THERE TO BE AT LEAST A CHOICE BETWEEN OPTION AND NOT DOING OPTION
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT MEANS THAT THERE WAS IN FACT A SECOND OPTION SO THE PHRASE THERE WAS NO OTHER OPTION IS ALWAYS FLAWED EITHER THERE WAS A SECOND OPTION OF DOING NOTHING OR THERE WAS NO OPTION IN THE FIRST PLACE ONLY INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES
SO TO MAKE MY ORIGINAL STATEMENT A LITTLE MORE POIGNANT
DETERMINISM THERE ARE PER DEFINITION NO POSSIBLE OPTIONS ALTERNATIVES ONLY ONE CONSEQUENCE FOR ANY EVENT THEREFOR THERE WAS NEVER PER DEFINITION A CHOICE BETWEEN ANYTHING
THE SEMANTIC MEANING THAT YOU PROPOSED FOR THE WORD CHOICE IS A SYNONYM FOR THE WORD CONSEQUENCE WHICH IS INCOHERENT WITH HOW OUR LANGUAGES DEFINE OPTION ALTERNATIVE ONE LAST TIME THERE CAN NEVER BE ONLY ONE OPTION
YOU CANNOT EVEN SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT THE YOU THAT YOU THINK EXISTS ACTUALLY DOES EXIST WITHIN PHYSICAL REALITY YOU ARE SIMPLY A COLLECTION OF MINDLESS PARTICLES MOVING AROUND AS DICTATED BY FUNDAMENTAL FORCES THERE ARE NO CHOICES THERE IS NO YOU

EVERYTHING THAT YOU EXPERIENCE IN PHYSICAL REALITY IS IN FACT AN ILLUSION THIS AT LEAST IS OBVIOUS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THAT WE ALL HAVE INCOMPLETE INFORMATION AND THEREFORE OUR INTERPRETATION OF EVENTS IS INCOMPLETE THIS INCLUDES YOUR PERCEPTION OF SELF AND YOUR PERCEPTION OF CHOICE SCIENTIFICALLY WE ARE AWARE THAT THE PARTICLES INSIDE OUR BODY HAVE NO DIFFERENCE TO THE PARTICLES OUTSIDE OUR BODY IN FACT THEY OFTEN MIGRATE FROM OUTSIDE TO WITHIN AND VISA VERSA IT MAKES NO IS NOTHING FROM YOUR A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE WHICH CAN ALLOW YOU TO DEDUCE THAT YOU ARE NOT A BRAIN IN A VAT THERE ISNT EVEN ANYTHING FROM A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE THAT CAN DEDUCE THAT A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IS TRUE

BUT WHY BE DEFEATIST I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE TRUTH IT IS IMPORTANT TO BEAR IN MIND OUR REASON FOR HAVING TRUTH OUR ILLUSION OF EXPERIENCE IS STILL EXPERIENCE AND SINCE OUR PRIORITIES ARE ARBITRARY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE THAT IT IS AN ILLUSION CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE THE GAME OF POKER THE NORMAL MODEL FOR STRATEGY IN POKER INVOLVES ASSUMING THAT THE CARDS ARE RANDOM BUT WE KNOW IN FACT THIS IS FALSE IF WE HAD SOME TECHNOLOGY OR ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE CARDS WHILE THEY ARE BEING SHUFFLED AND KEEP TRACK OF WHAT EACH ONE IS THEN IT WOULD BE BETTER TO USE THAT MODEL WE KNOW WHAT THE CARDS ARE WE DO NOT NEED TO INVOLVE ANY PROBABILITY BUT SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE THAT CAPABILITY THAT MODEL IS NOT USEFUL TO US USELESS KNOWLEDGE IS FALSE

IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE UNIVERSE IS DETERMINISTIC WE THEN MUST ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO CALCULATE OUR OWN FUTURE CHOICES IF SO THEN OF COURSE FREE WILL BECOMES AN ABSURD CONCEPT IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THEN ALL THE IMPLICATIONS OF DETERMINISM BECOME IDENTICAL TO BEING FALSE THE EFFECT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IF IT WAS FALSE REGARDLESS OF OUR PRIORITIES THE FALSE REALITY WE HAVE IS NEVERTHELESS THE ONLY REALITY WE HAVE

CALCULATING OUR OWN CHOICES IS INDEED IMPOSSIBLE IT REQUIRES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE STATE OF EVERY PARTICLE THAT MAKES UP US BUT KNOWLEDGE REQUIRES PARTICLES SO YOU HAVE TO FIT GREATER INFORMATION INTO LESS INFORMATION THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
I LIKE YOUR APPROACH IN FACT IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS MINE I JUST THINK YOU'RE NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH IF WE START TO ANALYZE SPECIFIC MORAL CHOICES WE WILL FIND THAT NOT ONLY US INCLUDES A BIG CHUNK OF THE WORLD BUT ALSO THAT THE BOUNDARIES OF THIS CHUNK ARE NOT WELL-DEFINED AND HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON WHAT KIND OF MORAL CHOICE WE'RE EXAMINING WE ARE NEBULOUS CREATURES WHICH MEANS ARGUING ABOUT OUR NATURE AND BEHAVIOR WITH FULL ANALYTIC STRICTNESS IS RARELY POSSIBLE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE MUST NOT ARGUE

ALSO IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS POSITION THAT FREE WILL IS BASICALLY AN ILLUSION BECAUSE WHEN WE CHOOSE WE ARE FULLY CONFIDENT THAT IT IS THIS MAGICAL US MAKING THE CHOICE AND NOT SOME PAST HISTORY AND STRUCTURE WHETHER WE AGREE OR NOT THAT THIS HISTORY AND STRUCTURE ARE PART OF US OR NOT IF WE DIDN'T THAT WE ARE MAKING OUR CHOICES THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO ARGUE ABOUT AND THE VERY TERM FREE WILL WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE EXISTED AND AGAIN WHILE IT IS ILLUSION IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THAT IT'S USELESS OR MEANINGLESS WE JUST NEED TO GET USED TO DEALING USEFULLY WITH THINGS THAT SEEM CONTRADICTORY VAGUE OR EVEN WRONG
COMPATIBILISM AND INCOMPATIBILISM ARE COMPATIBLE IT'S JUST THAT THEY DEFINE FREE WILL DIFFERENTLY SO YOU CAN BELIEVE BOTH AND NOT CONTRADICT YOURSELF
HOW DO I FILTER SUBREDDITS FROM APPEARING WHEN I BROWSE R ALL
TO ME MORAL RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD ALWAYS SIMPLY BE THE INDICATION PUT FORWARD BY THE TENDENCIES OF AN INDIVIDUAL AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE LIKELY TO RESULT FROM HOW WE DECIDE TO ACT OR NOT ACT ON THAT PERSON A PERSON SHOULD ONLY BE MORALLY RESPONSIBLE IF THEM UNDERTAKING THE CONSEQUENCES WE ASSIGN TO THAT MORAL RESPONSIBILITY WOULD RESULT IN GREATER OVERALL HAPPINESS AND LOWER OVERALL SUFFERING AND I THINK THAT THE MASSIVE SUCCESS OF THE SCANDINAVIAN JUSTICE SYSTEMS ARE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SUCH DEMANDS OUGHT TO BE INCREDIBLY SMALL RELATIVE TO WHAT WE ARE USED TO DEMANDING FOR REDEMPTION IN THE UNITED STATES
I WOULD ARGUE THAT WHILE UNDER DETERMINISM YOU CAN HAVE THE INTERNAL EXPERIENCE OF MAKING A CHOICE BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE OUTCOME WAS NEVER IN QUESTION NO CHOICE WAS ACTUALLY MADE I GUESS THE POINT OF DIFFERENTIATION COMES DOWN TO WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IN A PLATONIC IDEAL OF CHOICE OR YOU DEFINE CHOICE AS THE NEUROLOGICAL PROCESS BEINGS ENGAGE IN THAT LEADS TO ACTION IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE MULTIPLE RESPONSES ARE PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE MY OBJECTION TO THE SECOND DEFINITION IS THAT IT MAKES FREE WILL TAUTOLOGICAL
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THE VIEW THAT DETERMINISM IS TRUE BUT WE OPERATE AS IF IT WASN'T IN ORDER TO STRUCTURE OUR SOCIETY
THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT THERE IS INPUT PROCESS OUTPUT IF THE BRAIN IS SOMETHING IT IS THE ONE WHICH PROCESSES ASSUMING THAT WE ARE THE BRAIN OF COURSE THE CAUSATION OF THE OUTPUT THOUGHTS ACTIONS ETC CAN ONLY BE A RESULT OF INPUTS OR THE PROCESS ITSELF SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO CONTROL INPUTS IE VISION ETC WE CAN POTENTIALLY ONLY CONTROL THE PROCESSES O THE BRAIN BUT THAT MEANS THAT SINCE WE CONTROL THE PROCESS WE DON'T LIVE IN A DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE IF WE ARE THE BRAIN THEN WE ARE THE PROCESS HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN CONTROL THE OUTPUT BECAUSE THE PROCESS IS BOUND IN A DETERMINISTIC WORLD SAYING THAT SINCE WE ARE THE BRAIN AND THE BRAIN CREATES AN OUTPUT WE HAVE A FREE WILL IS LIKE SAYING SINCE MY PC IS MY HARD WARE AND THE HARDWARE CREATES THE OUTPUT MY PC HAS FREE WILLIAM UNLESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING
THERE A PRIMARY CATEGORY I THINK THAT WAS MISSED I'D SAY IT'S MORE COMMON FOR COMPATIABALIST TO BELIEVE THINGS ARE DETERMINISTIC AND FREE WILL IS AN ILLUSION BURIED UNDERNEATH THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE REAL WORLD

SO APPARENT FREEWILL NOT TRUE FREE WILLIAM SOME USE THE WORD ILLUSION OTHERS DON'T EVEN WANT THAT STRING OF AN ASSOCIATION WITH LIBERTARIAN FREE WILLIAM
BUT IF THE CHOICE IS DETERMINED THEN IT'S NOT A CHOICE
NO PART OF THE ENTIRE REALITY IS OUTSIDE OF A DETERMINISTIC SET OF EVENTS
DESPITE WHATEVER DEFINITION WE GIVE THE WORD CHOICE THE FACT IS THAT NO PART OF THE SYSTEM IS FREE TO ACT IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN WHAT IT IS PREDETERMINED TO DO EVEN IF THE OUTCOME IS TOO COMPLEX TO PREDICT IT WAS DETERMINED BY EVERYTHING BEFORE IT
EITHER WE ARE JUST LIKE COMPUTERS THAT IS WE CONSIST OF A BUNDLE OF ALGORITHMS ACCORDING TO WHICH WE FUNCTION THIS COULD BE A SIMULATION WE COULD BE LIVING WITHIN A COMPUTER BUT THEN YOU MAY SAY WE HAVE THOUGHTS EMOTIONS THE QUESTION IS WHERE DO THOUGHTS ARISE FROM AND DO WE POSSESS ANY LEVEL OF CONTROL OVER THE THOUGHTS WE THINK LET'S ASSUME WE ARE COMPUTERS CAPABLE OF FEELING PERHAPS WE HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED WITH CERTAIN OF EMOTIONS EXTERNAL STIMULI FOLLOWED BY AN EMOTIONAL REACTION WE CAN'T DISPROVE FREE WILL BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT IN THE MOST PRIMAL STATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT WE ARE SLAVES TO INSTINCT IT'S VERY VERY COMPLICATED WHERE DO THOUGHTS ARISE FROM THE SUBCONSCIOUS AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS CONSISTS OF PAST EXPERIENCES PAST TRAUMAS INGRAINED BELIEFS I LIKE TO THINK THAT WE DO HAVE FREE WILL IN THAT WE ARE AWARE OF ALL THESE COMPLICATIONS AND THOUGHTS I THINK OUR EVOLVED SELF-AWARENESS HAS INTRODUCED A LEVEL OF FREE WILL AWARENESS BEING THE THOUGHT BEHIND THE THOUGHT BEHIND THE THOUGHT WE HAVE BECOME AWARE OF OUR OWN AWARENESS AND AWARE OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF OF DETERMINISTIC SIMULATION OR NO SIMULATION OR A SIMULATION IN WHICH WE HAVE FREE WILL WHOO KNOWS
STILL TO BE CONVINCED NOT HEARD A SOUND RESPONSE IN FAVOUR OF FREE WILL FUNNILY ENOUGH AFTER HEARING ABOUT IT FROM SAM HARRIS
HOW DO YOU ARGUE FOR CHOICES IN A DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE THE PREMISE OF A DETERMINISTIC UNIVERSE DICTATES OUR CHOICE AS OUR ENTIRE GENETIC BACKGROUND AS WELL AS EXPERIENCE IS ASSUMED TO BE DETERMINED
THE WHOLE QUESTION OF FREE WILL FEELS NONSENSICAL TO ME ALTHOUGH I CANNOT PINPOINT WHY EXACTLY I THINK IT CAN SAFELY BE SAID THAT HUMANS DO NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE AS BEINGS OR AT LEAST WE ONLY HAVE A PARTIAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE ARE I THINK THE IDEA OF FREE WILL AS WELL AS THE IDEA OF NO FREE WILL ARE THE RESULT OF AN IMPERFECT UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ASKING THIS QUESTION IS THERE FREE WILL IS LIKE TRYING TO SEE SEEING OR TOUCH TOUCHING AND PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THIS QUESTION IS STILL NOT SATISFACTORILY ANSWERED

IF THE EARTH IS FLAT THEN WHY DOES THE HORIZON CURVE WE WOULD NOT SEEK TO RECONCILE THE APPARENT CURVATURE OF THE HORIZON WITH A FLAT EARTH THEORY IN FACT WE SIMPLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE EARTH IS SPHERICAL ONCE WE DO THEN THE WHOLE QUESTION WHY DOES THE FLAT HORIZON CURVE IS REVEALED AS SOMEWHAT NONSENSICAL


THE SIXTH PART ASSUMES A SEPARATE PERMANENT SELF WHICH IS LIBERTARIANISM THERE IS ALSO A PROBLEM WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT THE PRESENT SELF AS TAKING DECISIONS BASED ON THE PAST SELF AS IF THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IN THE NEXT MOMENT ARGUE THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH THE SAME THINGS THEN THE SELF IS MAKING ITSELF TAKE DECISIONS OK SO THE PAST SELF HAD DREAMS AND PLANS BUT THAT PAST SELF IS NO LONGER YOU

ANYWAY EVEN IF WE ACCEPT THIS PERMANENT SELF I DON'T THINK ANYONE DOUBTED THAT THE SELF WAS A PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS THE PRESENT SELF IS ALREADY DOING THAT THE QUESTION IS INSTEAD WHETHER THAT SELF IS CREATED FROM SOMETHING EARLIER AND OUTSIDE FACTORS ALSO PARTICIPATE IN AFFECTING THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS I WOULD SAY YES ON BOTH ACCOUNTS

AS A CO PLATE ASIDE NOT EXACTLY A PART OF THE ARGUMENT JUST THINKING OUT LOUD I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT SELF IN THE PRESENT MOMENT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THOUGH DOES IT INCLUDE THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT INTERPRETS THE SIGNALS FROM THE EYES HOW ABOUT THE EYES HOW ABOUT THE GLASSES HOW ABOUT YOUR TEACHER WHO TAUGHT YOU TO READ HOW ABOUT THE TEXT YOU'RE READING BUT WHAT IF YOU WROTE THAT TEXT WHERE IS THE LINE DRAWN I'M NOT SURE WHERE THIS ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS A SELF COMES FROM IN TERMS OF A SOLID ENTITY
GREAT PIECE OF WORK GIVEN YOUR STIPULATED DEFINITION I FOUND IT A WELL ROUNDED SERIES OF CONVINCING POINTS AND PREMISES

I WOULD SAY WITHOUT THAT STIPULATED DEFINITION IT MAY HAVE GONE IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION IF YOU WERE AIMING TO DEFEND THESE PREMISES IN A BROADER SENSE OF INCLUDING CHOICE AS BEING ABLE TO COINCIDE WITH CAUSAL DETERMINISM

I'D BE INTERESTED IN A FOLLOW UP OF YOUR IDEAS ONE DAY TAKEN SIMPLY THE ANTECEDENT EVENTS AND CONDITIONS AND LAWS OF NATURE AS EXPLANATIONS OF CAUSAL DETERMINISM IF YOU COULD COME TO A SIMILAR CONCLUSION THE EXCLUSION OF MORALITY WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT DEFINITION
THIS IS MORE A PROBLEM OF LANGUAGE THAN OF ANYTHING ELSE AND AS SUCH IT ISN'T THAT INTERESTING OR IMPORTANT
EVERYONE IS FREE TO RESPOND TO STIMULI RIGHT

EVEN IF THE HUMAN BRAIN IS JUST A GROSSLY COMPLEX LOGIC MACHINE THERE ARE STILL VARIATIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS ALTHOUGH PEOPLE MAY HAVE SIMILAR REACTIONS TO SAME CIRCUMSTANCES THE MENTAL PROCESSES ARE SNOWFLAKE UNIQUE I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE THIS ON THE MOLECULAR LEVEL I EAST THE CHEMICAL SIGNALS USED RATHER THE ORIENTATION OF CELLS AND THE PATHWAYS THEY USE

FREE WILL MIGHT JUST BE CHALKED UP TO SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN CHEMISTRY AND COMPOSITION

THUS I FEEL THAT FREE WILL IS SIMPLY AN OBSCURE SEPARATION STILL DICTATED BY THE WAY YOUR BRAIN IS CONSTRUCTED PART OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS MIGHT BE DETERMINED BY FREE WILLED THOUGHTS CHOSE IN REACTION TO STIMULI BUT THE COMPOSITION OF THE BRAIN IS PREDETERMINED BY GENETICS HARDWARE VS SOFTWARE BRAIN STRUCTURE VS MEMORIES EXPERIENCES THOUGHT PROCESS

I STILL SEE FREE WILL AS A LARGE GREY AREA WHAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A CHOICE COULD STILL BE INFLUENCED BY MORE PRIMITIVE BRAIN ACTIVITY ACTIVITY LINKED TO VESTIGIAL GENETICS AND INSTINCT THIS BEGS THE QUESTION DO ANIMALS WITH SUB-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE HAVE FREE WILL

EDIT SPELLING
I LIKE THE IDEA OF TRYING TO PROVE A TAUTOLOGY FALSE

BY SAYING THAT MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IS SUFFICIENT FOR FREE WILL YOU HAVE TO PRESUPPOSES MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

IF DETERMINISM NO MORAL RESPONSIBILITY ERGO MORAL RESPONSIBILITY ERGO FREE WILL

SO WE ARE GIVEN DETERMINISM THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THESE PRIOR CAUSES AND THEREFORE THEY DO NOT FORCE US TO CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE US AND THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ACTIONS AND THEREFORE WE DO HAVE FREE WILLIAM

YOU LITERALLY JUST PRESUPPOSE A LACK OF FORCED CHOICE

YOU HAVE TO PROVE THERE IS A CHOICE AT ALL DETERMINISM PRESUPPOSES SO YOU ARE LITERALLY JUST OFFERING A PARADOX AS PROOF WHERE AS IN ANY OTHER LOGICAL PROCEEDING A CONTRADICTION IS OFFERED AS DISPROOF

DETERMINISM DIRECTLY STATES YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE

DETERMINISM IS THE PHILOSOPHICAL IDEA THAT EVERY EVENT OR STATE OF AFFAIRS INCLUDING EVERY HUMAN DECISION AND ACTION IS THE INEVITABLE AND NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF ANTECEDENT STATES OF AFFAIRS

IN A DETERMINISTIC WORLD ANY ACTION IS PREDICATED ON EVERYTHING PRIOR TO IT AND BY DEFINITION IS INEVITABLE AND NECESSARY

IF MY DECISION IS BOTH INEVITABLE MEANING THAT IT MUST HAPPEN P CERTAIN ERGO NOT A CHOICE AND NECESSARY REQUIRED BY THE LAWS WHICH WOULD ENFORCE DETERMINISM THEN IT IS IN NO WAY A CHOICE JUST A CHAIN IN A SERIES OF REACTIONS

IF THE SAME SETUP RESULTS IN THE SAME OUTCOMES EVERY TIME THAT'S DETERMINISTIC OTHERWISE IT'S NONDETERMINISTIC

IT IS LITERALLY TAUTOLOGICAL TO SAY THAT DETERMINISM IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE TO FREE WILL BECAUSE YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO SUGGEST THAT ANY DECISION WAS EVER MADE

DETERMINISM AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY ARE IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION BECAUSE THERE'S NO MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU HAD NO CHOICE

AND THE REAL BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE DETERMINISTIC OR NOT FREE WILL OR NOT NOTHING CHANGES IF YOU BEHAVE CONTRARY TO MORAL CODE BECAUSE IT IS FREE WILL YOU WILL BE SELECTED OUT AS ANTITHETICAL TO THE SYSTEM IF YOU BEHAVE CONTRARY TO MORAL CODE BECAUSE THERE IS NO FREE WILL YOU WILL BE SELECTED OUT AS ANTITHETICAL TO THE SYSTEM

THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU ACTUALLY ARE MAKING CHOICES ACTIVELY OR IF THEY WERE MADE FOR YOU CHOICE IS MADE EITHER WAY
AH COMPATIBALISM THE GOOD OLD LET'S REDEFINE THIS TERM IN A WAY THAT FITS OUR MODEL TRICK

ALL GOOD AND WELL BUT LET'S BE CLEAR THAT THE BROAD PUBLIC COLLOQUIAL NOTION OF FREE WILL IS IN FACT NOT THE POPULAR PHILOSOPHICAL COMPATIBALIST NOTION BUT THE LIBERTARIAN VERSION AND INDEED COMPATIBALIST FREE WILL IS QUITE INCOMPATIBLE WITH IT AND RATHER MORE LIKE THE DETERMINIST VIEW WHERE THINGS ARE RELABELED FOR EMOTIONAL CONVENIENCE

IT'S A BIT LIKE FEMINISM SURE IT'S ACTUALLY A MOVEMENT ABOUT EQUALITY OF PEOPLE OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT MANY ADVOCATING FOR IT WOULD LIKE TO DEFINE IT AS BUT IF YOU WERE IGNORANT OF THE CURRENT POLITICS OF THE MOVEMENT YOU'D BE FORGIVEN FOR THINKING IT'S A MOVEMENT ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER GROUPS INDEED MANY BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE GROUP DO LABOUR UNDER THAT ASSUMPTION NO DOUBT IN NO SMALL PART DUE TO THE NAME

AT SOME POINT THE LABELS ARE MISLEADING AND NOT SO USEFUL

IN THIS CASE COMPATIBALIST FREE WILL MIGHT BE BETTER REFRACTURED AS SOMETHING LIKE THE ABILITY OF AN ENCLOSED SYSTEM OR THE SELF AS DEFINED BY THE MATERIAL BODILY COMPONENTS OF A PERSON TO ACT RELATIVELY INDEPENDENTLY OF THE EXTERNAL SYSTEM NOT PARTICULARLY CATCHY BUT A MORE ACCURATE CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED RELATIVE TO THE POPULAR CONCEPTION OF FREE WILLIAM MAYBE WE COULD REDUCE THAT MOUTHFUL DOWN TO SOMETHING LIKE RELATIVE SYSTEM OR INDIVIDUAL INDEPENDENCE

I EAST THAT AT ANY POINT IN TIME AN INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM HAS RELATIVELY MORE ABILITY TO EXERT CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN BEHAVIOUR THAN EXTERNAL SYSTEMS EVEN IF THERE IS ULTIMATELY SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE FROM THE EXTERNAL SYSTEM NTO THE INTERNAL SYSTEM AND VICE VERSA
EVERYTHING IS BUDDHA NATURE

WHAT IS DETERMINISM

MU LIKE YOU SAID THERE IS NO SELF SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF BUDDHA NATURE
SAM HARRIS IS ABOUT AS MUCH OF A PHILOSOPHER AS MY LEFT ARSE CHEEK
I'M NOT A DETERMINIST LET ALONE A HARD DETERMINIST BUT I DISAGREE WITH YOU I DEFINE FREE WILL AS THE ABILITY OF CONSCIOUS AGENTS TO ACT FREE OF THE CONTROL OF THINGS I DEFINE THE SELF AS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A BEING

YOU DEFINE THE SELF AS ALL THE THINGS OF WHICH AN ORGANISM IS COMPOSED AND BY WHICH IT IS AFFECTED YOU DEFINE FREE WILL AS THE ACTIONS BEING ABLE TO BE CAUSED ONLY BY THAT OF WHICH THE SELF IS CONSTITUTED NAMELY THAT OF WHICH IT IT IS COMPOSED AND BY WHICH IT IS AFFECTED

FIRST OF ALL IN YOUR POST YOU SEEMED TO POSIT FIRST THAT FREE WILL IS DEFINED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED DEFINITION I SAID YOU ASSERTED YOU SEEMED TO POSIT THIS WHEN YOU WROTE THAT THE YOU THE SELF IS CONSTITUTED OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS BY WHICH ONE IS AFFECTED AND THE NEURONS OF WHICH ONE IS COMPOSED AND THAT ONE HAS FREE WILL AS LONG AS THESE FACTORS ARE WHAT CONTROLS ONE'S CHOICES TAKE NOTE THAT ONE'S ENVIRONMENT IS AN OUTSIDE FORCE BY WHICH ONE IS AFFECTED BY YOUR ARGUMENT THEN A CHOICE THAT IS CHOSEN BY ONE'S FREE WILL CAN BE DETERMINED BY AN OUTSIDE FORCE

THEN YOU POSITED THAT FREE WILL CANNOT BE DETERMINED BY AN OUTSIDE FORCE YOU GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WHEN YOU DISCUSSED THE PROBE IN THE BRAIN

THIS IS A CONTRADICTION IN YOUR ARGUMENT UNLESS YOU ASSERT THAT SOME OUTSIDE FORCES ARE PART OF WHAT CONSTITUTES THE SELF AND OTHERS ARE NOT THIS THESIS YOU WOULD DIRELY NEED TO DEFEND

SECOND OF ALL I DISAGREE WITH YOU IN VIRTUE OF OUR DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS THESE OF COURSE ARE OPEN TO DISCUSSION
DELETED

WHAT IS THIS
BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE A QUINTESSENTIALLY LIBERTARIAN VIEW OF THE SELF IN THAT IT MUST PROPOSE A SELF SEPARATE FROM CAUSATION SINCE WE ARE ASSUMING DETERMINISM IS TRUE THIS WON'T WORK

THIS IS WHERE YOUR ENTIRE ARGUMENT FALLS APART THIS WON'T WORK THE DETERMINISTIC VIEW OF THE SELF IS CORRECT RATHER IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE LIBERTARIAN VIEW OF THE SELF IS CORRECT BUT THERE IS NO YOU IN THAT CASE DETERMINISM BECOMES INCOMPATIBLE WITH FREE WILL SINCE IT REMOVES THE POSSIBILITY OF THE EXISTENCE OF PERSON THIS IS THE VIEW TO WHICH I ASCRIBE
YES THIS MORE OR LESS TO ME SEEMS LIKE A VERY ELEGANT WAY OF PUTTING THE COMPATIBALIST STANDPOINT WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS AGREED WITH WELL DONE
REMOVED
LAME A SEMANTIC SOLUTION TO A PERENNIAL PROBLEM JUST DEFINING YOURSELF AS THE TOTAL CAUSAL NEXUS DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING AND IT DOESN'T DETERMINE WHETHER YOU HAVE FREE WILL WHICH IS BASICALLY THAT THE ENTIRE CAUSAL NEXUS HAS FREE WILL A BIZARRE CONCLUSION

AS I SAID IN A COMMENT ON A PREVIOUS THREAD OF THIS SUBJECT THE WHOLE IDEA OF A YOU IN A DETERMINISTIC FRAMEWORK IS NONSENSE IF THE CAUSAL DETERMINISM IS TRUE THEN YOU ARE JUST A BUNDLE OF CAUSES IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ASK WHETHER A BUNDLE OF CAUSES IS FREE OR NOT IT'S JUST A SERIES OF EVENTS TO ASK IF FREE WILL EXISTS IS TO SUPPOSE IT EXISTS FOR SPECIFIC PERSONS OR AGENTS BUT TO DEMARCATE PERSONS AND AGENTS IN A DETERMINISTIC WORLD IS IMPOSSIBLE ONLY THE LIBERTARIAN PERSPECTIVE CAN SUPPORT THE NOTION OF INDIVIDUAL EGOS WHICH IS WHY THE LIBERTARIAN PERSPECTIVE IS IMPLAUSIBLE THERE ARE NO EGOS IN A DETERMINISTIC WORLD SO THERE'S NO NEED TO EVEN RAISE THE QUESTION OF FREE WILL AT ALL
YAY THE WEEKLY FREE WILL DISCUSSION IS HERE FUCK SAKE GROW UP THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MAGIC WILLIAM YOU ARE A BUNCH OF ATOMS VIBRATING THAT'S ALL THAT'S IT WHAT YOU PERCEIVE TO BE FREE WILL IS SIMPLY THE UNIVERSE UNFOLDING ACCORDING TO ITS LAWS OF PHYSICS WHY IS THIS SO HARD TO SWALLOW
WE HAVE FREE WILL BECAUSE WHAT MAKES US STEMS FROM THE QUANTUM LEVEL QUANTUM PHYSICS TELLS US THAT ANYTHING SUBATOMIC IS MORE PROBABILISTIC IN NATURE IT IS YOUR FREE WILL THAT COLLAPSES THE PROBABILITY INTO REALITY
IF A GROWTH IN YOUR YOU HAVE NO CONTROL YOU TO HAVE IMPULSES THAT YOU ALSO HAVE NO CONTROL YOU ACT FREELY IF YOU ACT ON THOSE URGES

VIRTUALLY EVERYONE ANSWERS NO TO THIS QUESTION COMPATIBILIST AND INCOMPATIBILIST ALIKE IT'S WILDLY FALSE TO ACT LIKE COMPATIBILISTS ARE COMMITTED TO ANSWERING YES TO THIS QUESTION OR LIKE THE DISPUTE BETWEEN COMPATIBILISM AND INCOMPATIBILISM TURNS ON THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
GREAT VIDEO THANKS FOR POSTING VIEW IS VERY APPEALING AND SENSIBLE THAT WE'RE FREE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE IN CONTROL

WHAT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT IS HOW DETERMINISM IS CONFLATED WITH FATALISM IN THE PREVIOUS VIDEO THAT SEEMS A BIT MMMFFF I'M PRETTY SURE THAT PHYSICS HAS GIVEN THE LIE TO DEMON THE CONCEPT THAT ONE COULD ABSOLUTELY KNOW THE FUTURE BY KNOWING ALL THE PRESENT PHYSICAL FACTS
DR HOFFMAN WAS THE LECTURER FOR MY VERY FIRST PSYCH COURSE AT UC IRVINE WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRAD THERE

I'M NOW WORKING ON MY PH D IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE BECAUSE THIS DUDE GOT ME TOTALLY STOKED ABOUT THE TOPIC WHEN HE TAUGHT IT
THAT VIDEO IS FAR TO SHORT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT HE HAS A LONGER TALK TITLED CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE INTERFACE THEORY OF PERCEPTION THAT GOES A BIT INTO THE MATHEMATICS

AS FOR THE THEORY ITSELF I DON'T REALLY GET IT WHEN HE STARTS REMOVING THE WORLD OUT OF IT'S MODEL AND REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER CONSCIOUS AGENT HE LOSES ALL CONNECTIONS WITH WHAT WE INTUITIVELY WOULD CALL A CONSCIOUS AGENT IN REALITY THAT MIGHT BE FINE AS FAR AS THE MATH IS CONCERNED BUT THE MATH IS ONLY USEFUL WHEN IT DESCRIBES WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE WORLD
THIS IS FUCKING BANANAS
WONDERFUL SUMMARY OF KANT AND WHERE HE WENT WRONG I'VE RARELY HEARD METAPHYSICAL WORK ARTICULATED SO WELL
HIS BOOK ON WITTGENSTEIN IS INCREDIBLE
I LIKE THAT HE ENDS BY IMPLYING THAT MATHEMATICS IS NOT PROFOUND AS SOMEONE WHO'S STUDIED MATH FOR OVER A DECADE NOW I QUITE AGREE JUST LIKE WITTGENSTEIN I BELIEVE IT'S A GAME WE PLAY WITH RULES WE TOO MADE UP
THANKS FOR THIS
GREAT LECTURE HE HAD ME RIGHT UP UNTIL THE LAST SENTENCE THOUGH THE THING ABOUT IF GOD WERE REAL AND DOGS HAVING FOUR LEGS THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM WAY OUT IN LEFT FIELD CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE
THIS WAS AN AMAZING LECTURE THANKS FOR SHARING
THAT WAS REALLY ENJOYABLE AND CLEAR THANKS
REMOVED
I'M NOT A MATHEMATICIAN OR A PHILOSOPHER BUT THIS SEEMS GROUNDBREAKING
WHETHER OR NOT THE WORLD YOU IMAGINE AS THE REAL REALITY IS ACCURATE TO WHAT THE REALITY ACTUALLY IS HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH ANYTHING IN MY OPINION

THE TRUTH STATEMENTS MADE HERE ARE VERY POOR IN THAT THEY AREN'T ADEQUATELY ANALOGOUS TO THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS BEING PRESENTED

JUST BECAUSE THE MARS ALIEN WOULDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION TO REALIZE THAT HIS SPLATTER LOOKS LIKE WHAT WE CALL A TREE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE MARS ALIEN COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT THE SPLAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING HE'S NEVER PLAYED WITNESS TO

AS SUCH JUST BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER SEEN WHAT A REALITY OUTSIDE OUR OWN ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T IMAGINE THAT IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING WE KNOW WE CAN'T PLACE THE DETAILS BUT WE CAN PLACE THE CONCEPT

TAKING THE SIDE OF HIS ARGUMENT IS LIKE BEING PRISONER INSIDE OF A COMPLEX THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THE LAYOUT OFF YOU'RE STUCK IN YOUR WINDOWLESS ROOM IT'S SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEX YOU'RE IN OR THE COUNTRY THAT HOUSES IT THAT YOU COULDN'T BE INSIDE OF A PRISON COMPLEX ANY VISUALIZATION YOU MADE OF THE COMPLEX WOULD BE FALSE AND THEREFORE THE GREATER IDEA MUST BE FALSE THIS ISN'T HOW TRUTH STATEMENTS WORK THIS ISN'T HOW ANY OF THIS WORKS
COULDN'T WE INVERT THE ARGUMENT

IF I'M A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER AND I SAY I'M NOT A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER THEN WE COULD STILL SAY THAT THE WORDS BRAIN AND COMPUTER DO NOT REFER TO REAL THINGS SO THE STATEMENT IS FALSE AND I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER RIGHT
LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE DOES NOT MEAN LOGICALLY POSSIBLE TO DISPROVE ALL THAT WE CAN SAY IS THAT THERE IS THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT THIS IS SIMULATION BUT ALSO AS REAL A POSSIBILITY THAT IT IS NOT

THE ARGUMENT SEEMS SO STEM FROM THE IDEA THAT A SIMULATION OF AN ENVIRONMENT CAN NOT BE PROVEN TO ALWAYS BE EQUAL TO THE ENVIRONMENT IT IS ATTEMPTING TO SIMULATE THIS SIMULATION IS FIRST GIVEN AS ARTWORK OF A TREE OR SHADOWS OF A CHAIR IN THE CAVE ETC

NICE TALKING POINTS BUT ALL IT DOES IS CAST DOUBT ON THE PROVABILITY FOR EITHER SCENARIO
I GIVE CREDIT TO THE CREATOR FOR TRYING BUT THIS IS JUST ONE ARGUMENT THAT'S EASILY COUNTERED THE TRUTH IS WE JUST DON'T KNOW AND PROBABLY CAN'T KNOW
THIS ARGUMENT IS EXAMINING A MATRIX LIKE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A PHYSICAL CONSCIOUS BRAIN IN THE REAL WORLD THAT IS BEING FED A SIMULATED REALITY BY A COMPUTER

I THINK THE MORE MIND BOGGLING SITUATION WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE NO PHYSICAL EMBODIMENT IN THE REAL ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS A SIMULATION AND WE ARE A PRODUCT OF THAT SIMULATION IE WE EVOLVED IN THAT SIMULATION

SINCE SIMULATION AS A CONCEPT IS FAIRLY UNIVERSAL IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT TECHNOLOGY YOU USE OR EVEN IF THE LAWS ATTRIBUTES IN YOUR SIMULATION ARE SIMILAR THE IDEA OF SIMULATING AN EVENT THROUGH COMPUTATION IS ABSTRACT ENOUGH TO INHERENTLY BE THE SAME I DON'T THINK THIS ARGUMENT WOULD IN ANY WAY DISPROVE IT

FOR EXAMPLE IF THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF YEARS FROM NOW WE HAD ENOUGH COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND ADVANCED ENOUGH SOFTWARE TO SIMULATE A UNIVERSE WITH SLIGHTLY ITERATIVE IN THAT SIMULATION AN INTELLIGENT CONSCIOUS SPECIES EVOLVED WHETHER THAT IS POSSIBLE OF COURSE IS WHOLE OTHER CAN OF WORMS TO THIS SPECIES THE IDEA OF SIMULATION WOULD BE THE SAME AS OURS THOUGH THEIR TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNIQUE MAY BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN OURS
IT IS POSSIBLE IF IT HAS IN ITSELF IMPLICATIONS FLAWS OR META INFOS ABOUT ITSELF STORED AND ACCESSIBLE FOR US BUT THERE ISN'T A GRANTEE THAT THIS IS THE CASE A PERFECT SIMULATION WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH FROM REALITY THIS IS MORE OR LESS THE REASON WE CAN USE MATH TO BUILD AND PREDICT STUFF BECAUSE CALCULATING THE OUTCOME AND STRUCTURE OF SOMETHING IS IDENTICAL TO BUILDING IT AND TRYING IT OUT AS LONG AS OUR ASSUMPTIONS HOLD
THE MARTIAN TREE ARGUMENT SEEMS EXTREMELY WEAK

THE HUMANS PERCEPTION OF A TREE IS BASED ON HIS VARIOUS SENSES OF IT IF SOMEONE WHO'D NEVER SEEN A TREE HAD ALL OF HIS SENSES PERFECTLY SIMULATED IN WHAT SENSE WOULD HE BE DISCONNECTED FROM THE REAL TREE

IN OTHER WORDS THE MARTIAN TREE ARGUMENT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THE MARTIAN ONLY SEES A POOR QUALITY PAINTING OF A TREE BUT IN THE MATRIX WE'D SEE A PERFECT QUALITY DIMENSIONAL IMAGINE ALONG WITH THE ASSOCIATED SMELLS AND TEXTURES THE SOUND OF THE LEAVES RUSTLING ETC


THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SIMULATION THEORY I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE GETS THE WHOLE I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER ARGUMENT BUT THAT REALLY DOESN'T ADDRESS THE GNOSTIC DEMIURGE DESCARTES DIEU TROMPEUR OR THE CONCEPT OF OUR WORLD BEING A SIMULATION CONSTRUCT
THE ENTIRE PREMISE OF THE ARGUMENT PRESENTED IN THE VIDEO IS THAT WE MUST HAVE OBSERVATIONAL EXPERIENCE TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE ISN'T THIS FALSE ON ITS FACE AREN'T THERE WHOLE FIELDS OF MATHEMATICS WHICH CLAIM TO DERIVE KNOWLEDGE FROM CONCEPTS WHICH CANNOT BE OBSERVED HOW CAN IT BE THAT KNOWLEDGE OF A THING REQUIRES A FIRST HAND OBSERVATION OF THAT THING
THE ARGUMENT THAT WE CANNOT PERCEIVE AN ACTUAL REPRESENTATION OF AN OBJECT WITHOUT SEEING AN OBJECT WITH OUR OWN EYES IS PREPOSTEROUS WE IN FACT DO NOT SEE ANYTHING HOW IT ACTUALLY IS BUT ONLY AS IT IS REPRESENTED BY THE SIGNALS THAT OUR EYES SEND TO OUR BRAIN THIS SIGNAL CAN BE INTERFERED WITH SUCH AS HALLUCINATIONS BUT EVEN A CLEAR IMAGE OF SOMETHING IS STILL JUST THE WAY OUR BRAIN INTERPRETS SIGNALS FROM THE EYES IF A COMPUTER SENDS THE EXACT SAME IMAGE TO OUR BRAIN OF A TREE THAT OUR EYES WOULD SEE ON THEIR OWN THEN THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMAGES AT ALL EXCEPT WHAT METHOD EYEBALLS OR COMPUTER ARE SENDING THE IMAGE SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN THEY ARE BOTH AS REAL OR ARTIFICIAL AS EACH OTHER DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DEFINE IT

IT'S SIMILAR AND AS RIDICULOUS AS THE THEORY THAT ANCIENT PEOPLE LITERALLY COULD NOT SEE APPROACHING SHIPS ON THE OCEAN BECAUSE THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE THE THEORY IS THAT THEIR MINDS JUST DIDN'T COMPUTE THE VISUAL INFORMATION BECAUSE IT COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT SO THE SHIPS WERE LITERALLY INVISIBLE TO THEM I JUST CAN'T ACCEPT THAT IF THAT THEORY WERE TRUE THEN PEOPLE WOULDN'T PERCEIVE THINGS ALL THE TIME EVERYDAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD PLAINLY SEE THAT NEW CAR YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE INVISIBLE THAT ALIEN SPACESHIP ON TV INVISIBLE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL AND I FEAR I'M MISSING SOMETHING AND JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT BECAUSE PEOPLE OF NOTORIETY SEEM TO HOLD THESE THEORIES IN HIGH REGARD

THE SAME LOGIC CAN BE USED TO PROVE OR DISPROVE THERE IS A GOD MAYBE EVEN THIS GOD MADE A MATRIX
VQULEE

IS A LONG VERSION BUT MY FAVORITE
PHILOSOPHY NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME WITH THE BULLSHIT IT WILL UNVOTE
THE ARGUMENT THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN A TREE SO YOU CAN NEVER RELATE WHAT A CUMULATED TREE IS IS ONE OF THE PRIME POINTS OF THIS ARGUMENT THEN REMEMBER THAT THE MATRIX HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR GENERATIONS THAT MEANS EVEN IF YOU HAVENT SEEN A TREE BECAUSE YOU ARE A SECOND GENERATION BUT THE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN A REAL TREE AND A SIMULATED ONE ESTABLISHED THAT THIS IS WHAT A TREE SHOULD LOOK LIKE THEREFORE YOU WILL ACCEPT THAT FACT OUR MINDS ALSO FUNCTION BY REINFORCEMENT OF FACTS AND THAT IS HOW WE LEARN AND ASSOCIATE
THE PART I DONT GET IS HOW THIS IS RELEVANT FOR ANYTHING
ALL I COULD HEAR FROM THE FIRST SECOND WAS THIS GUYS MOUTH STICKING TOGETHER LIKE MARCO RUBIO HAVE A FUCKING DRINK
FORGIVE ME IF I'M WRONG BUT ISN'T THE PURPOSE OF CAVE ALLEGORY AND THE MATRIX THAT WE'RE ALREADY LIVING IN A SIMULATION THAT OUR BRAIN PROCESSOR IS SIMULATING THE WORLD AS WE SEE IT

THAT WHEN WE SEE A TREE THE REFLECTION LIGHT THAT'S WITHIN THE SPECTRUM WE CAN PERCEIVE HITS OUR EYES AND OUR BRAIN MAKES A SIMULATION OF THE TREE BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY SEE THE REAL THING THE ATOMS IN THEIR TRUE FORM

TESLA ONCE SAID IF YOU WANT TO FIND THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE THINK IN TERMS OF ENERGY FREQUENCY AND VIBRATION BASICALLY THAT EVERYTHING MATERIAL IS ENERGY VIBRATING TO GIVE ITS STATE SOLID LIQUID GAS AT A FREQUENCY WE CAN OR CAN NOT PERCEIVE WITHIN THE LIGHT OR SOUND SPECTRUM THIS IS PROBABLY A BIT OFF SO IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS BETTER PLEASE FEEL FREE I WANT TO LEARN MORE




REMOVED
I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IT'S METAPHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT WE ARE LIVING IN THE MATRIX ALSO SEE THIS AWESOME REBUTTAL BY DAVE CHALMERS
THE BASIS OF THE ARGUMENT IN THE VIDEO IS THAT WE SHARE ZERO EXPERIENCE WITH A POSSIBLE THIS IS AN UNPROVEN ASSUMPTION ALL RIGHT IF THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS SIMULATIONS ITSELF IN THAT POSSIBLY VERY DIFFERENT WE CAN'T BE IN SUCH A SIMULATION MAKES SENSE BUT IT'S A BOLD ASSUMPTION AT LEAST AS BOLD AS THE OPPOSITE THE ONLY PARALLEL WE HAD TO ASSUME TO HAVE WITH THAT WOULD BE THAT THE CONCEPT OF SIMULATION ITSELF EXISTS THERE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND IN ORDER TO EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OUTSIDEWORLD YOU HAD INDEED TO IMAGINE A WORLD THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT IN ITS FUNDAMENTALS POSSIBLY UNIMAGINABLE TO US
THIS ARGUMENT ONLY WORKS IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE MATRIX THOUGH
THIS APPEARS TO BE BACK TO FRONT

IT'S MAY BE PERFECTLY LOGICALLY POSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT WE ARE IN A SIMULATION IF WE ARE INDEED INSIDE ONE

IT PROBABLY IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT WE ARE NOT IN A SIMULATION IF WE INDEED ARE NOT

THERE ARE CERTAIN INTERESTING PHYSICS EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED WHICH WOULD HAVE CERTAIN RESULTS IF WE WERE INDEED INSIDE CERTAIN TYPES OF SIMULATION

COMPUTATION AFTER ALL ISN'T LIMITED TO A CERTAIN SET OF DIMENSIONS OR PHYSICAL LAWS

IF THOSE COME UP WITH NOTHING THEN WE MAY STILL BE IN A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SIMULATION BUT IF THEY PANNED OUT THEN WE COULD CONTINUE TO TRACE OUT THE DETAILS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SIMULATION UNTIL WE FIND A BUFFER OVERFLOW VULNERABILITY AND HACK OUR WAY OUT
THE VIDEO IMPLIES THAT A PERSON IN THE MATRIX WOULD ONLY EVER RECEIVE ELECTRICAL STIMULATION AND THUS TREE COULD ONLY REFER TO ELECTRICAL STIMULATION BUT HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT FROM NOW MY BRAIN RIGHT NOW ONLY UNDERSTANDS TREE TO REFER TO ELECTRICAL STIMULATION COMING FROM MY SENSES THAT IS WHY THE SIMULATION ARGUMENT IS POTENTIALLY COMPELLING IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF OUR BRAINS IF WE TAKE OUT OUR EARS AND REPLACE THEM WITH MICROPHONES WHICH SEND ELECTRICAL SIGNALS TO OUR BRAINS OUR BRAINS CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS WHY COCHLEAR IMPLANTS WORK THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SEEING HEARING A REAL OBJECT AND RECEIVING ELECTRICAL IMPULSES FROM A MECHANICAL SENSOR OR EVER RECEIVING ELECTRICAL IMPULSES FROM A MACHINE CAPABLE OF GENERATING APPROPRIATE SIGNALS WITHOUT SENSORS IS WHAT MAKES THE IDEA OF A SIMULATED REALITY COMPELLING HOWEVER THIS ARGUMENT SEEKS TO ASSERT THAT THIS IS FALSE EVEN THOUGH WE ALREADY KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE
RUSSELL FLYING TEA POT APPLIES REALLY WELL TO THE SIMULATION ARGUMENT AS WELL NOT JUST RELIGIOUS BELIEFS THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THE SIMULATION CONCEPT LIKE TO USE THE PROVE ME WRONG STANCE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PROVE IT RIGHT THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES WITH THE ONES MAKING THE CLAIM
SOMEONE FIRES ELECTRIC SIGNALS INTO MY BRAIN LETTING ME KNOW THIS IS A TREE I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT A TREE IS

MY EYES FIRE ELECTRIC SIGNALS INTO MY BRAIN LETTING ME KNOW THIS IS A TREE I DO KNOW WHAT A TREE IS

DOES THE VIDEO MAKER NOT KNOW HOW EYES WORK OR IS OUR EYES SOMEHOW BETTER THAN THE SIGNALS FROM THE MATRIX

I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING ABOUT PHILOSOPHY BUT THIS STOOD OUT TO ME AS A RATHER OBVIOUS WRONG CONCLUSION FROM THE VIDEO MAKER
THERE IS A THEORY WHICH STATES THAT IF EVER ANYONE DISCOVERS EXACTLY WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS FOR AND WHY IT IS HERE IT WILL INSTANTLY DISAPPEAR AND BE REPLACED BY SOMETHING EVEN MORE BIZARRE AND INEXPLICABLE

THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH STATES THAT THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED


AS SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER READ PUTNAM OR REALLY EVEN PAID ATTENTION TO THIS VIDEO OR REALLY READ ANY PHILOSOPHY THAT WASN'T WRITTEN BY SAM HARRIS LET ME JUST SAY THIS ARGUMENT IS TOTAL GARBAGE
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES PUTNAM AND MOST OF THIS THREAD ENTIRELY MISS THE ACTUAL POINT OF THE EVIL DEMON BRAIN IN A VAT MATRIX THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
SO TO SUMMARIZE
IF WE EXIST IN A VIRTUAL REALITY THEN WE DO NOT HAVE LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE OBJECTS EVENTS IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD
2 IF WE DO NOT HAVE LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE OBJECTS EVENTS IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD THEN STATEMENT WE MAKE ABOUT BEING WITHIN A VIRTUAL REALITY IS FALSE
IF ANY STATEMENT WE MAKE ABOUT BEING IN A VIRTUAL REALITY IS FALSE WE MUST NOT BE IN A VIRTUAL REALITY


THIS ENTIRE ARGUMENT HINGES ON THE INABILITY TO HAVE LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE EXTERNAL EVENTS IRONICALLY ENOUGH THE VERBALIZATION OF THE ARGUMENT REQUIRES LANGUAGE THAT DOES JUST THAT BY MAKING ANY STATEMENT ABOUT VIRTUAL VS EXTERNAL REALITIES WE ARE INVALIDATING THIS VERY ARGUMENT

I TEND TO STICK TO THE CONCEPT THAT WHAT YOU PERCEIVE IS YOUR REALITY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A SIMULATION OR NOT WITNESSING AND EXPERIENCING WHAT'S AROUND YOU IS JUST AS REAL AS REAL REALITY CONSIDER INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL DISABILITY THEIR PERCEPTION OF REALITY MIGHT BE WILDLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WITHOUT THE MENTAL IMPEDIMENT BUT DOES THAT MAKE THEIR REALITY LESS REAL TO THEM NO IT DOESN'T
I'M HOPING ONE DAY WE WILL FIND THE EASTER EGG THAT THE SIMULATION PROGRAMMERS ADDED FOR US TO DISCOVER
DELETED

WHAT IS THIS
THE LAST TIME I LINKED THIS VIDEO I PUT A MISLEADING TITLE THAT CONFUSED MANY VIEWERS THIS TITLE IS MORE TRUE TO THE CONTENTS OF THE ACTUAL VIDEO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE IDEA PRESENTED HERE IS HILARY SOME OF HIS ARGUMENTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE OCCASIONALLY IFFY AND CONFUSING AT TIMES I DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL LINKS IN THE DESCRIPTION THAT SHOULD PRESENT NICE COUNTERARGUMENT
IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT A BRAIN OR A COMPUTER IS WE COULD STILL BE A BRAIN CONNECTED TO A COMPUTER AND NOT KNOW IT SO WHY DOES HE COME TO HIS CONCLUSIONS
FAILURE TO REFER NONSENSE AND FALSITY

ONE OF THE PORTIONS OF THE ARGUMENT AS PRESENTED ANYWAYS SEEMS TO ME ODD THE SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT APPEARS TO ARGUE THE FOLLOWING

ATTEMPTING TO REFER TO ANYTHING UNEXPERIENCED WILL BE A FAILED REFERENCE
A FAILED REFERENCE IS NONSENSE IN THE LITERAL SENSE OF NOT HAVING ANY MEANING
IF A PROPOSITION CONTAINS A FAILED REFERENCE THE ENTIRE PROPOSITION IS RENDERED NONSENSE
IF A PROPOSITION IS RENDERED NONSENSE IT IS RENDERED FALSE
IF AN ENTITY HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE MATRIX THEN ANY ATTEMPT BY THAT ENTITY TO REFER TO ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE MATRIX WILL BE A FAILED REFERENCE
THE ATTEMPTED PROPOSITION I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER ATTEMPTS TO REFER TO THINGS OUTSIDE THE MATRIX VIDELICET BRAIN AND COMPUTER
ERGO THE ATTEMPTED PROPOSITION I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER FAILS TO REFER TO THINGS OUTSIDE THE MATRIX FOR AN ENTITY THAT HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE MATRIX
ERGO THE ATTEMPTED PROPOSITION I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS NONSENSE FOR AN ENTITY THAT HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE MATRIX
ERGO THE ATTEMPTED PROPOSITION I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS FALSE FOR AN ENTITY THAT HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING OUTSIDE THE MATRIX

THE CONDITION THAT LINKS NONSENSE TO FALSITY SEEMS SUSPECT TO ME IS NOT AN ATTEMPTED PROPOSITION WITH PORTIONS THAT FAIL TO REFER SIMPLY NOT A PROPOSITION

UNLIKE THE VIDEO THOUGH I BELIEVE PUTNAM INDICATES THAT SINCE THEY HAVE NO EXPERIENCES OF THINGS OUTSIDE THE MATRIX WHEN LIFELONG RESIDENTS OF THE MATRIX ATTEMPT TO REFER TO COMPUTERS OR BRAINS THEY RELY ON THEIR EXPERIENCES OF MATRIX COMPUTERS I EAST ONE'S EXPERIENCE OF COMPUTERS AS GENERATED BY THE MATRIX AND MATRIX BRAINS I EAST ONE'S EXPERIENCE OF BRAINS AS GENERATED BY THE MATRIX RATHER THAN REAL COMPUTERS I EAST ONE'S EXPERIENCE OF ACTUAL COMPUTERS AND REAL BRAINS I EAST ONE'S EXPERIENCE OF ACTUAL BRAINS THEIR EXPERIENCES THUS RENDER THE UTTERANCE I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER AS BEING ABOUT MATRIX COMPUTERS AND MATRIX BRAINS AND THIS OF COURSE IS FALSE FOR LIFELONG RESIDENTS OF THE MATRIX EQUALLY AS MUCH AS I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS FALSE FOR THOSE WHOSE REAL BRAINS AREN'T HOOKED UP TO REAL COMPUTERS IF I AM A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE MATRIX AND THUS ONLY HAVE EXPERIENCES OF MATRIX COMPUTERS AND MATRIX BRAINS THEN I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER CAN ONLY REFER TO MATRIX COMPUTERS AND MATRIX BRAINS AND THUS MY UTTERANCE IS TRIVIALLY FALSE IF I HAVE EXPERIENCES OF REAL COMPUTERS AND REAL BRAINS THEN I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS TRIVIALLY FALSE THE UTTERANCE I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS THUS FALSE NO MATTER WHO SAYS IT



ATTEMPTS TO LINGUISTICALLY ESCAPE THE MATRIX

REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT ATTEMPTED PROPOSITIONS THAT FAIL TO REFER BEING FALSE PROPOSITIONS OR NOT LET US TRY TO FIND A WAY TO HELP US DETERMINE WHETHER WE ARE INDEED IN THE MATRIX

IT DOES SEEM INTUITIVE THAT IF WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SOMETHING THEN WE CAN NOT REFER TO IT BUT ARE THERE THINGS THAT CAN BE EXPERIENCED BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE MATRIX I LIKE TO THINK THAT THERE ARE AND THAT THESE THINGS INCLUDE ABSTRACT CONCEPTS SUCH AS ANALOGY AND SETS AND PRETTY MUCH ANY CONCEPT FROM THE VARIOUS LOGICS AND MATHS A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE MATRIX MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY REFER WHEN HE SUPPOSES THAT ONE REAL COMPUTER AND ONE REAL COMPUTER MAKE TWO REAL COMPUTERS AT BEST SUCH A STATEMENT WOULD ONLY REFER TO MATRIX COMPUTERS DESPITE ATTEMPTING TO TARGET REAL COMPUTERS BUT CAN NOT A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE MATRIX SAY THAT ONE AND ONE MAKE TWO JUST AS READILY AS SOMEONE OUTSIDE THE MATRIX WHAT ABOUT ANALOGY

SUPPOSE A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE MATRIX PERHAPS A MAD COMPUTER SCIENTIST CODES UP A AND HOOKS UP AN ENTITY TO THIS SO THAT WHEN THE ENTITY BEGINS EXPERIENCING THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME ITS EXPERIENCES WILL BE WITHIN THIS NOW LET US SUPPOSE OUR LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE MATRIX UTTERS THE FOLLOWING STRING

I AM IN A SITUATION ANALOGOUS TO THE SITUATION IN WHICH MY CAPTIVE IS

OF COURSE WERE HE INSTEAD TO UTTER I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER HE EITHER SPEAKS NONSENSE OR A FALSITY SINCE BRAIN AND COMPUTER AS HE UTTERS IT CAN'T REFER TO REAL BRAIN AND REAL COMPUTERS BUT WHAT OF THE STRING WE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED HE UTTERED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT ANALOGIES IN THE MATRIX ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN ANALOGIES IN REALITY THAT THE CONCEPT OF SITUATIONS IS NO DIFFERENT IN THE MATRIX THAN IN REALITY AND HE DOES SUCCESSFULLY REFER TO HIS CAPTIVE AS OPPOSED TO SOME CAPTIVE OUTSIDE THE MATRIX TO WHICH HE CAN'T REFER IS WHAT WE SUPPOSED HE UTTERED A PROPOSITION AND IF IT IS IS IT ONE THAT CAN POSSIBLY EVALUATE TO TRUE RATHER THAN ALWAYS EVALUATE TO FALSE OR NONSENSE



A FUN CURIOSITY AFTER ESCAPE CAPTURE

FOR THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS ARGUMENT PUTNAM SUPPOSES THAT THE RESIDENTS OF THE MATRIX HAVE NEVER HAD EXPERIENCES OF REAL THINGS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE MATRIX SUCCESSFULLY ESCAPES AS NEO DID IT APPEARS TO ME THAT ANY PROPOSITION ABOUT CONCRETE THINGS WILL BE WRONG THE FIRST FEW TIMES SINCE UP UNTIL THAT POINT HE HAS ONLY HAD EXPERIENCES OF THINGS INSIDE THE MATRIX IT SEEMS TO ME I COULD FOLLOW HIM AROUND AND BLURT OUT HA YOU'RE WRONG LIKE AN ASSHOLE ANYTIME HE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT CHAIR IS MADE OF METAL SINCE ONLY HAVING PRIOR HAD EXPERIENCES WITH MATRIX CHAIRS AND MATRIX METAL HIS UTTERANCE WOULD MISTAKENLY REFER TO MATRIX CHAIRS AND MATRIX METAL DESPITE THAT HE'S IN THE REAL WORLD EXPERIENCING FOR THE FIRST TIME REAL CHAIRS AND REAL METAL

NOW LET US FURTHER SUPPOSE THAT HE CONTINUES HIS UTTERANCES AND I CONTINUE BEING AN ASSHOLE BLURTING OUT HOW WRONG HE IS AT WHAT POINT WILL HIS UTTERANCE THAT CHAIR IS MADE OF METAL FINALLY REFER TO REAL CHAIRS AND REAL METAL INSTEAD OF MATRIX CHAIRS AND MATRIX METAL
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF OUR OPERATORS SPILLED COFFEE ON OUR SIMULATION MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DINOSAURS
THIS VIDEO HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ELON MUSK BOSTROM SIMULATION THEORY

THEIR CONJECTURE IS THAT HUMANS LIVED THROUGH THE TIME PERIODS THAT WE PERCEIVE AS OUR PAST UP TO THIS MOMENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO PERCEIVE AS THE FUTURE THE BASE REALITY THE ACTUAL NOW IN THE FUTURE THAT IS CONDUCTING THE SIMULATION THAT WE PERCEIVE AS CURRENTLY HAS ALL THE STORES KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE IN THE PST THROUGH WHENEVER THAT BASE TIME IS IN THE FUTURE

THEY TOOK THAT KNOWLEDGE AND CREATED A SIMULATION JUST LIKE THE SIMS VIDEO GAME MUCH LIKE THOSE CHARACTERS IN THE SIMS IF THE WERE SENTIENT BEINGS WOULD BELIEVE THEY WERE IN REALITY AND EVEN QUESTION REALITY AT TIMES REMEMBER WHEN THEY LOOK THROUGH THE MONITOR AT YOU WE TOO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN BOTH REAL AND REAL TIME WHEN WE ARE SIMPLY A SIMULATION IN A WAYYYYY FUTURE VIDEO GAME SIMULATION WITH AMAZINGLY HIGH POWERED COMPUTERS AND MASSIVELY COMPLEX AI

THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS POSTULATION AND THE ONE IN THE VIDEO IS THAT THIS IDEA IS ABSOLUTELY PLAUSIBLE WE CREATE SIMULATIONS ALL THE TIME IMAGINE WHAT THESE WILL LOOK LIKE MILLENNIA IN THE FUTURE WITH ALL THE INSANE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED IT'S LIKE WATSON COMMERCIAL ON STEROIDS EVERYTHING FROM SOCIETIES MEMORIES AND DATABASES ARE PROGRAMMED INTO SIMULATIONS US AND LEFT TO RUN AND RECREATE THEIR PAST THEN IMAGINE THESE SIMULATIONS TAKING PLACE ON THE X BOXES OF THE FUTURE IN THE TRILLIONS OF HOMES OF OUR FUTURE INHABITANTS OF ALL THE CRAZY PHILOSOPHIES OUT THERE THIS BY FAR AND AWAY MAKES THE MOST SENSE AS IT'S A PLAYED OUT EXTENSION OF WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING AGAINST REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES WILL HOLD
WHAT A WEAK ARGUMENT IT NEVER JUSTIFIES WHY THE CONCEPT OF SOMETHING IN THE MIND OF A PERSON WHO HAS NEVER REALLY EXPERIENCED THAT SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT FROM THE CONCEPT THAT A PERSON THAT HAS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THAT SOMETHING HAS IN HIS MIND
THE ANSWER IT THAT IT SIMPLY ISN'T WE GET INPUTS FROM OUR NERVES AND THAT'S IT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ADDED VALUE THAT CONFIRMS THEIR REALITY WHETHER I'M MAD AND I'M IMAGINING A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET THAT I'M WRITING THIS TOO OR THEY EXIST OR WE'RE ACTUALLY HOOKED UP TO A MACHINE OR WE'RE JUST SIMULATIONS INSIDE OF A MACHINE HASN'T ANY IMPLICATIONS ON THE QUALITY OF THE CONCEPT IN MY MIND

TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE ACTUALLY DO LIVE IN A SIMULATION WE SHOULD DO WHAT WE USUALLY DO WHEN STUDYING A BLACK BOX TRYING TO FIND A SITUATION WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK AS IT'S SUPPOSED TO AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND ITS INNER WORKINGS MAYBE ONE DAY WE'LL FIND THAT AT A CERTAIN SCALE THE UNIVERSE LAGS ITS COMPUTING POWER CAN'T COPE UP WITH A PRYING EYE THAT ASKS FOR TOO MUCH DETAIL AND WE'LL HAVE OUR ANSWERS FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THERE'S A LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT A CERTAIN VOLUME IN SPACE-TIME CAN HOLD THAT COULD BE AN ACTUAL VIABLE DIRECTION OF INQUIRY
HOW TO DEFINE SIMULATION WHO'S SIMULATION DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE BEEN STARTED BY SENTIENCE OTHERWISE YOU COULD ARISE ARGUE THAT THE UNIVERSE ITSELF BASICALLY IS A SIMULATION A SIMULATION ALSO DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO TRY AND APPROACH SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS IT CAN BE COMPLETELY UNIQUE
DEBUNKED I CAN RECOGNIZE SIMULATED TREES IN WOW BECAUSE MY BRAIN RECOGNIZES IT'S A TREE BASED ON PREVIOUS INFORMATION THE BRAIN IN THE BASE REALITY COULD HAVE CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS BEING SIMULATED IN FRONT OF IT IN ITS ANCESTOR SIMULATION IT'S UNDERGOING THIS PHILOSOPHY PERSON IS RELYING HEAVILY ON HIS INITIAL MARS ASSUMPTION WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY BEGGING THE QUESTION

THEREFORE IF HIS MARS ASSUMPTION IS WRONG THE REST OF IT IS WRONG
PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE WE MIGHT BE LIVING IN A SIMULATION DO THEY I'D LIKE TO GIVE HUMANITY ENOUGH CREDIT THAT PEOPLE THAT DUMB DON'T EXIST
ISN'T THE UNKNOWABLE EVER LOVELY AND TEMPTING
THIS VIDEO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME AND MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING IT CORRECTLY

DOESN'T THIS DISCREDIT THE IDEA OF CREATIVITY AND THE IDEA OF ENVISIONING SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST AS HUMANS WHO CREATE FICTIONAL UNIVERSES ALL THE TIME WE VERY MUCH ENVISION THINGS WE HAVE NO BASIS FOR JERT HAD TO ENVISION AN ORC BEFORE WRITING IT ORCS DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST SO ACCORDING TO THIS VIDEO JERT COULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF IT BUT HE DID

HIS ARGUMENT IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A LOCKED ROOM IN A BUILDING THAT THE BUILDING CAN'T EXIST BUT THE BUILDING DOES EXIST YOU'RE JUST LOCKED IN A SINGLE ROOM
TO ADD EVERYTHING WE LEARN COMES IN THROUGH OUR SENSES AND OUR SENSES CAN BE FOOLED
DELETED
NICE TRY EVIL DEMON
SIMPLE THE SIMULATION DOESN'T ALLOW THAT SORT OF THINKING
ELON MUSK WAS JUST PLAYING AROUND TALKING MESS AND ALL YOU BITCHES WANT TO CLAIM ITS REAL GET A LIFE
PRESENTER STATES THE FOLLOWING

A MARTIAN THAT SEES AN IMAGE OF A TREE CANNOT FULLY COMPREHEND WHAT THE TREE IS AS AN OBJECT
2 THEREFORE HE CAN'T HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE TREE IS
HUMANS CANNOT SEE OUTSIDE THE SIMULATION SPACE
THEREFORE HUMANS ARE NOT LIVING IN A SIMULATION SPACE

AM I RIGHT THEN HOW IS THIS NOT ALSO TRUE

THEREFORE THE MARTIAN DEDUCES THAT TREES CANNOT EXIST

AND ANY OTHER NUMBER OF PRETTY INANE STATEMENTS THAT FALL OUT OF THE ASSERTION
I THINK THEREFORE I AM
CAN WE BE FINISHED WITH MAKING VIDEOS ABOUT THIS TOPIC
SOUNDS LIKE SIMILAR LOGIC TO WHAT I READ SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE BACTERIA LIVING IN OUR STOMACH IF IT'S LIVED IN OUR STOMACH IT'S WHOLE LIFE NEVER HAVING LIVED OUTSIDE OF OUR STOMACH THEN HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY CONCEIVED OF A STAR LIKE OUR SUN A GALAXY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

BUT IT'S A BACTERIA AND WE ASSUME THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR LOGIC AND IMAGINATION LIKE HUMANS DO SO THE IDEA SEEMS TO FALL APART

AND JUST BECAUSE A MARTIAN CONCEIVES OF SOME SPLATTER OF INK DIFFERENTLY THAN THE REAL WORLD OBJECT THAT WE KNOW AS A TREE DOESN'T MEAN THE MARTIAN IS WRONG HE'S IMAGINING A REAL OBJECT EVEN IF HE'S DOING SO IMPRECISELY FROM OUR STANDARDS IT DOESN'T NEGATE THE TREE IN OUR WORLD IN ANY WAY
ANYONE DEFINED REAL YET
NOT TO SHORT-CIRCUIT THIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT BUT TO ME A MAJOR REASON WHY WE CAN'T PROVE IF WE'RE LIVING IN A SIMULATION IS BECAUSE THE FIRST THING ANY IDIOT WOULD DO IF PROGRAMMING SUCH A THING WOULD BE TO DISALLOW INFORMATION THAT DEMONSTRATES YOU'RE LIVING IN A SIMULATION
LOL HE SAID LOGIC
WHAT IF I GET HIT BY A TRUCK SAW MY BODY MANGLED BEYOND SURVIVABILITY AND THEN ALL I COULD PERCEIVE IS A BLACK SCREEN FLASHING THE WORDS

GAME OVER

BUY MORE CREDITS HERE

WHILE NOT DEFINITIVE I'D SAY THAT WOULD BE PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE I'D BEEN LIVING INSIDE A SIMULATION
HORRIBLE VIDEO THE GUY LITERALLY TRIED TO MAKE THE POINT OF WE ARE NOT A SIMULATION BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF WHAT WE EXPERIENCE AS REALITY THEREFORE WE MUST BE IN REALITY OR IT'S SIMULATION REALITY AND WE WOULD NEVER KNOW SERIOUSLY NOT ONE VALID POINT IN THIS VIDEO
SEEMS LIKE CIRCULAR LOGIC TO ME HE USES AN ARGUMENT AT ONE POINT THAT IMPLIES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT AND THEN USES THAT THOUGHT EXPERIMENT TO PROVE ITS IMPOSSIBLE NOT EVEN REMOTELY CONVINCED
I THINK THE YOUTUBER HAS MISUNDERSTOOD THE ARGUMENT HE IS PRESENTING

RATHER THAN AN ARGUMENT THAT WE ARE NOT IN THE MATRIX IT SEEMS TO INSTEAD BE AN ARGUMENT THAT IF WE ARE IN THE MATRIX THEN WE HAVE NO CAPACITY TO DETERMINE THAT FACT AS WE LACK THE CONTEXT TO MAKE ANY STATEMENTS WHATSOEVER ABOUT WHAT MIGHT EXIST OUTSIDE OF OUR PERCEPTION THE IDEA THAT WE MUST NOT BE BRAINS IN A JAR BECAUSE A BRAIN IN A JAR LACKS THE CONTEXT TO UNDERSTAND SUCH A SITUATION IS NONSENSICAL

FURTHER THE YOUTUBER IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT IN SAYING THAT WE ARE SAFE IN ASSUMING WE DO NOT LIVE IN THE MATRIX REGARDLESS OF THIS ARGUMENTATION I BELIEVE THE ARGUMENT GOES THAT IF SIMULATION OF A SYSTEM LARGER THAN THE ONE IT IS SIMULATED ON IS POSSIBLE THEN IT IS INEVITABLE THAT A UNIVERSE WITH HUMAN LIFE WOULD BE SIMULATED AND THE HUMAN LIFE IN THAT UNIVERSE WOULD SIMULATE A UNIVERSE WITH HUMAN LIFE ON AND ON TO SOME POINT WHERE FURTHER SIMULATION IS NOT POSSIBLE THE CHANCES OF OUR LIVING IN A WOULD BE X WHERE X IS THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE NESTED SIMULATIONS
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A SIMULATION FROM THE INSIDE WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM THE OUTSIDE IT'S FAR FORM IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A SIMULATION

MOREOVER IF BY SIMULATION EAST G A GAME WE UNDERSTAND

INTERACTING WITH AN EXPRESSION OF INFORMATION COMPUTER GRAPHICS SOUND SIMULATOR'S MOVEMENT

BY USING INTERFACES GAMEPAD HEADPHONES ETC

THIS INTERACTION IS REALISTIC ENOUGH TO BE EMOTIONALLY AND INTELLECTUALLY CONSUMED BY IT

INFORMATION IS ORDERED ENERGY COMPUTER MEMORY ADD



AND THEN IF WE ASSUME THAT MATTER IS ENERGY AND

INTERACTING WITH MATTER IS OUR EXPERIENCE

INTERFACES ARE OUR SENSES

IT IS REALISTIC TO A LEVEL INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM REALITY WHATEVER THE REALITY IS

INFORMATION ARE LAWS OR PHYSICS CHEMISTRY BIOLOGY



IT SEEMS THAT EVERY MAJOR RELIGION TRIES TO USE THIS CONCEPT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ADDING TO IT INFORMATION ABOUT THE CREATOR AND PURPOSE

VIDEO GAME ADDICTION MAY PRESENT ITSELF AS COMPULSIVE GAMING SOCIAL ISOLATION MOOD SWINGS DIMINISHED IMAGINATION AND ON ACHIEVEMENTS TO THE EXCLUSION OF OTHER EVENTS IN LIFE
THIS SEEMS WRONG TO ME THE CORE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT ONE CANNOT CANNOT VERILY REFER TO SOMETHING OF WHICH ONE HAS NO DIRECT EXPERIENCE HAVING ONLY SEEN IT REPRESENTED BUT IF THAT REPRESENTATION IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE REAL THING THEN YOU CAN REFER TO IT AND IDENTIFY IT JUST FINE I'VE NEVER MET A KANGAROO BUT I COULD REFER TO ONE WITH SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE AUTHENTIC KNOWLEDGE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BECAUSE I'VE ENCOUNTEREANY ACCURATE DEPICTIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS OF A KANGAROO
THE TITLE USED HERE IS CORRECT THE STATEMENTS IN THE VIDEO ARE NOT
THIS VIDEO IS A BIT CONFUSING IT PRESENTS AN ARGUMENT THAT WE CANNOT PROVE WETHER OR NOT WE ARE IN A SIMULATION WHICH MAKES SENSE BUT THEN IT SAYS THEREFORE WE MUST BE NOT IN A SIMULATION WHICH IS WRONGLY IMPLIED
FOR THOSE INTERESTED HERE'S A PAGE DISCUSSING THE COSMIC RAY THEORY THAT THE PERSON IN THE VIDEO MENTIONED


IT LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT WE AREN'T LIVING IN A SIMULATION
HOW EVER WE DO LIVE IN SOME FORM OF THE MATRIX PERHAPS NOT DESIGNED OR GOVERNED BY ALIENS RATHER BY NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE
OUR PERCEPTION IS A FILTERED VERSION FROM THE OUT SIDE UNIVERSE TO OUR EXPERIENCE IT IS NOT THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE WE ARE ONLY PRIVY TO WHAT OUR BRAINS CHEMICAL RESPONSE INSINUATES WE ARE EXPERIENCING SO BASICALLY OUR INTERPRETIVE AWARENESS IS THE GLASS OF THE JAR
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEE WHAT COLOR YOU OBSERVE AND CALL RED VERSUS WHAT I OBSERVE AND CALL RED THEY ARE HOWEVER BORN OF THE SAME SEED TO THE EXPERIENCE AS WE BOTH GENERALLY AGREE THE DRESS IS RED SO WE ARE RUNNING IN THE SAME SIMULATION YET IN SEPARATE CONTAINERS
DONT WORRY TO MUCH JUST ENJOY IT WHATEVER IT IS
ISN'T THE TREE ANALOGY IN THE VIDEO BASICALLY WHAT MOUSE IS SAYING WHEN DESCRIBING TASTY WHEAT IN THE FIRST MOVIE

I ALSO DON'T REALLY AGREE WITH THE CONCLUSION DRAWN AT THE END IT SEEMS SEVERAL OTHERS DON'T AS WELL JUST BECAUSE BRAIN AND MATRIX MIGHT NOT REPRESENT THE EXACT SAME THING INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE SIMULATION DOES NOT MEAN SIMILAR THINGS DO NOT EXIST TREES STILL EXIST ON EARTH EVEN THOUGHT THE MARTIAN ONLY SEES A 2D REPRESENTATION ON MARS
AM I MISSING SOMETHING THIS ARGUMENT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE

FIRST IT'S USING A SUBSET TO NEGATE A SUPERSET THE MENTAL IMAGE OF THE PAINT BLOBS THAT APPEAR SOMETHING LIKE A TREE ISN'T THE SAME AS THE MENTAL IMAGE OF A TREE FOR HUMANS SURE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T HAVE THE SAME IMAGE AS A HUMAN DOES AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME IMAGE ISN'T THE SAME THING AS DEMONSTRATING IT CAN'T

THE MARTIAN IS CREATING AN IMAGE OF PAINT BLOBS IN A SHAPE THE MARTIAN IS FULLY CAPABLE OF IMAGINING A WORLD LIKE EARTH AND IMAGINING THAT IT HAS THESE THINGS ON IT THAT ARE BROWN FIBROUS TAKE IN LIGHT AND USE ITS ENERGY TO GROW ETC IT CAN USE ITS KNOWLEDGE OF LAWS OF PHYSICS THE MATH OF EVOLUTION CHEMISTRY BIOLOGY AND SO FORTH TO CONCEIVE OF EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS IN THE MENTAL IMAGE OF A TREE WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME WHEN WE IMAGINE WHAT OTHER WORLDS MIGHT LOOK LIKE SCIENCE FICTION IS FILLED WITH IMAGINED THINGS THAT NO HUMAN HAS EVER EXPERIENCED YET WE HAVE A VERY VIVID MENTAL IMAGE OF WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE HOW THEY OPERATE AND HOW THEY GOT THERE THE MARTIAN IS FULLY CAPABLE OF FORMING THE EXACT SAME MENTAL IMAGE THAT A HUMAN HAS OF A TREE

THE ODDS OF IT BEING ACCURATE ARE SMALL BUT THAT'S AN ISSUE OF ACCURACY AND GETTING BETTER SCIENCE ALLOWS ONE TO GET BETTER IMAGERY FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN PROBABLY QUITE ACCURATELY IMAGINE THE LANDSCAPE OF A PLANET KNOW IT'S SIZE THE TYPE OF STAR DISTANCE FROM THE STAR AND AGE WE CAN KNOW HOW IT FORMS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF WHAT ELEMENTS MAKE IT UP WHERE THEY SINK TO IN ITS FORMATION HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COOL WHAT ITS ATMOSPHERE IS LIKELY MADE OF AND USE LIGHT PHYSICS TO COME UP WITH A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE FROM THE SURFACE FROM THE STAR'S LIGHT ATMOSPHERE AND ROCK MATERIAL WE CAN DO THAT EVEN NEVER HAVING EXPERIENCED THE PLANET OR A PLANET WITH THAT EXACT CONSTRUCTION

FURTHERMORE IN WHAT WAY HAVE HUMANS EXPERIENCED THE TREE HERE IT'S MOSTLY FROM OUR SENSES AND PERHAPS ADDITIONALLY FROM OUR MENTAL IMAGING OF ITS PLACE IN A COMPLEX SYSTEM OF LIFE BIOLOGISTS MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT MENTAL IMAGE FOR EXAMPLE WE RECEIVE IMAGES FROM OUR EYES KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WITH OUR HANDS SMELL IT HEAR RUSTLING OF LEAVES ETC AND THEN AGGREGATED OVER TIME THERE IS NOTHING THERE THAT CAN'T BE REPLACED BY THE SAME SIGNAL SOURCES TO THE BRAIN COMING FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN PHOTONS INTO THE EYES PRESSURE WAVES INTO THE EARS AND CONVERTED TO SIGNAL VIA EAR DRUM CONTACT FORCES CONVERTED TO SIGNALS FROM NERVES IN THE FINGERS AND SO FORTH

ON TOP OF THIS WE CAN HAVE ILLUSIONARY EXPERIENCES LIKE HALLUCINATIONS MANY DUE I'VE HAD THE FEELING OF GRAVITY REVERSING TOWARD THE CEILING BUT BEING STUCK TO MY BED IT'S LASTED A FEW MINUTES I'M COGNITIVELY AWARE IT'S AN ILLUSION BUT IT STILL FEELS LIKE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED SO I'VE EXPERIENCED THINGS THAT AREN'T REAL

THE STATEMENT AROUND JUST SEEMS COMPLETELY FALSE SINCE THE MARTIAN HAS NEVER SEEN A TREE THROUGHOUT ITS ENTIRE LIFE IT CAN'T FOR APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATION OF IT TO IT THE TREE THAT WE SEE MIGHT LOOK LIKE A PECULIAR COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT IT HAS SEEN BEFORE ABOVE I DESCRIBED HOW WE CAN FORM APPROPRIATE REPRESENTATIONS OF THINGS WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE IN REAL LIFE

IT THEN SAYS THERE IS NO CAUSAL CHAIN FROM ACTUAL TREES TO THE MENTAL IMAGE DID I MISS WHERE THAT WAS DEMONSTRATED TO BE NECESSARY THAT SEEMS TO BE A FALSE REQUIREMENT WHAT YOU WOULD NEED IS A CORRELATION OF THE IMAGE TO A REALITY NOT A DIRECT CAUSAL CHAIN FOR EXAMPLE THE LAWS OF PHYSICS CAN BE THE SOURCE CAUSE FOR BOTH THE LAWS OF PHYSICS CAN CAUSE THE REAL TREE TO EXIST THE SAME LAWS OF PHYSICS COULD BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE MARIAN WHO COULD THEN SIMULATE WHAT THEY COULD DO ON A PLANET CLOSER TO THE SUN AND POSSIBLY GET IT EXACTLY RIGHT GETTING AN EXACT IMAGE OF THE TREE THAT MATCHES A AGAIN THE ODDS ARE SMALL ON BEING THAT ACCURATE BUT THAT'S A PROBABILITY ISSUE NOT A PROOF IT CAN'T HAPPEN AND SPECIFIC TO THE CHAOTIC NATURE OF NATURAL SELECTION IF INSTEAD OF A TREE WE USED AN IGNEOUS ROCK THAT IT NEVER EXPERIENCED IT'S MENTAL IMAGE COULD BE VERY CLOSE TO A MENTAL IMAGE IN PRINCIPLE

THEN AT IT JUST LOSES ME COMPLETELY SAYING LIKEWISE ANY MENTAL IMAGE THAT A BRAIN IN THE MATRIX HAS OF A TREE IS NOT A REPRESENTATION OF A TREE BECAUSE IT TOO HAS NEVER SEEN AN ACTUAL TREE EXCUSE ME A BRAIN IN A HUMAN BODY LIKEWISE HAS NEVER SEEN AN ACTUAL TREE THE ONLY THING IT HAS EXPERIENCED IS THE SIGNALS FROM OUR SENSORS WHICH CAN IN PRINCIPLE BE EXACTLY DUPLICATED IN FACT IT CAN BE DUPLICATED AT THE SIGNAL LEVEL AFTER THE EYE OR USING VIRTUAL REALITY TO SEND IMAGES INTO THE BRAIN

IN FACT THE WORLD OF VR SEEMS TO NEGATE MOST OF WHAT THIS ARGUMENT CLAIMS WE CAN EXPERIENCE A LOT OF THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST AT ALL ANYWHERE OR THINGS THAT DO EXIST BUT WERE EXPERIENCED BY SOMEBODY ELSE OR THINGS THAT WE'RE PREDICTING BASED ON OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT MAY BE CLOSE TO WHAT ACTUALLY DOES EXIST THAT NO HUMAN HAS EVER EXPERIENCED

THE SAME PROBLEM EXISTS AT WHEN IT'S TALKING ABOUT THE WORD TREE LET ME INVERT THE PROBLEM IMAGINE YOU HAD TWO BRAINS THAT ARE STILL ALIVE AND ACTIVE ONE IS FROM A HUMAN BEING THAT EXPERIENCED A TREE THE OTHER FROM A BRAIN THAT NEVER EXPERIENCED A REAL TREE BUT WAS GIVEN SIGNAL STIMULATION THAT EXACTLY MATCHED THAT OF THE OTHER ONE A SIMULATED TREE EITHER VIA VR OR DIRECT NERVE SIGNAL REPRODUCTION YOUR TASK IS TO FIGURE OUT WHICH BRAIN ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED A TREE TRY TO IMAGINE A TEST YOU COULD DO FROM THE OUTSIDE NOW IMAGINE THAT YOU COULD ALSO JUMP INTO EACH BRAIN TO SEE WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF TREES WERE LIKE WHAT TEST COULD YOU USE TO TELL THEM APART EITHER EXTERNALLY OR INTERNALLY THIS WHOLE LINE OF REASONING SEEMS TO BE BASED ON THE FALSE CLAIM THAT YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE A REAL THING TO FORM AN APPROPRIATE IMAGE OF IT BUT FALLS FLAT IN DOING SO

THE SAME BAD ARGUMENT SEEMS USED AT WITH I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER THE FALSE ARGUMENT CLAIMS THAT IT LACKS CONTEXT WITH THE REAL WORLD SO IT HAS NO EXPERIENCE OF WHAT A REAL BRAIN AND A REAL COMPUTER COULD BE WHAT THAT MAKES NO LOGICAL SENSE OF COURSE WE CAN

LET'S TAKE THE LITERAL INTERPRETATION WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE PEOPLE AND STIMULATE THEIR BRAIN IN SUCH A WAY AS TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT ISN'T REAL WHILE SITTING IN THE CHAIR EXPERIENCING THAT ILLUSIONARY THING WE CAN CONSCIOUSLY MAKE THE STATEMENT I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER EXPERIENCING THIS EVENT SO THE STATEMENT I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER CAN NEVER BE PROVEN FALSE BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY DEMONSTRATE IT BEING TRUE THE IDEA THAT A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER CAN'T HAVE A TRUE REPRESENTATION OF A REAL BRAIN OR A REAL COMPUTER IS JUST FALSE

IN THE CASE OF THE MOVIE THE MATRIX THE IMAGERY OF REAL BRAINS AND REAL COMPUTERS CAME FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF REAL BRAINS AND REAL COMPUTERS AND THE MACHINES SIMPLY DUPLICATED THAT EXPERIENCE VIA SIGNALS TO THE BRAIN THEY SIMPLY DUPLICATED THE EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE IN TERMS OF A VR RATHER THAN LIKE A VIDEO RECORDER ON PLAYBACK IT SIMULATED ALL OF THE SIGNALS FROM SENSES AS ALMOST INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM WHAT REAL PEOPLE EXPERIENCED BASED ON CREATING THE LAWS OF EXPERIENCE MEANING THE CONVERSION OF THE LAWS OF PHYSICS INTO THE SIGNALS IN THE BRAIN I SAY ALMOST BECAUSE THERE WERE GLITCHES WHICH IS PART OF THE MOVIE

BUT OF COURSE THE BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS ALSO METAPHORICAL MEANING IN PRINCIPLE WE COULD BE SIMULATED BEINGS COMPLETELY ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ABOUT HUMAN EXPERIENCE COMES DOWN TO INFORMATION PROCESSING SURE WE MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND IT ALL INCLUDING HOW CONSCIOUSNESS ARISES BUT IT WILL HAVE TO COME DOWN TO SOMETHING RELATED TO EMERGENT PROPERTIES OF COMPLEX INFORMATION PROCESSING BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT SURVIVES AND HOLDS CONTINUITY THROUGHOUT OUR LIFETIME THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY NO ATOMS IN OUR BODY THAT ARE THE SAME ATOMS AS WHEN WE WERE YEARS YOUNGER FOR INSTANCE THE ONLY THING THAT HOLD US TOGETHER IS THE CONTINUITY OF PATTERN WHETHER PHYSIOLOGICAL STRUCTURAL PATTERNS OR ELECTROCHEMICAL PATTERNS

WHEN PEOPLE SAY BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IT MORE GENERALLY MEANS THAT WE MAY NOT BE PHYSICAL BODIES IN THE SHAPES WE IMAGINE BUT ARE PATTERNS OF INFORMATION IN SOME SORT OF GENERALIZED COMPUTING DEVICE WE DON'T NEED TO EXPERIENCE THAT COMPUTING DEVICE AS GENERALIZED COMPUTING DEVICES ARE MATHEMATICAL AND UNIVERSAL NOT SPECIFIC TO HUMAN EXPERIENCE AS ARE INFORMATION INFORMATION PROCESSING AND PATTERNS

I JUST DON'T FIND THIS LINE OF REASONING USEFUL IN FACT IT COMPLETELY INVALIDATES ALL OF ITS CLAIMS WHEN IT SAYS AT THE END UNLESS NEO AND MORPHEUS SHOW UP TO TELL US IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT WE DON'T LIVE IN THE MATRIX IF ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS ARE ABOUT WHAT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IMPOSSIBILITY OR PROOFS IT'S A LIKELIHOOD CALCULATION

A BETTER APPROACH WOULD HAVE BEEN TO START WITH PROBABILITY OR EVEN TO DISCUSS THE IDEA OF EQUIVALENCE FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW OUR OWN PERCEPTIONS MENTAL IMAGES ARE NOT CORRECT REPRESENTATIONS OF MATTER AND ENERGY EVEN JUST SOLID VS DISCRETE ATOMS RELATIVELY FAR APART ARE DIFFERENT CONCEPTS YET MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE FORMER PERCEPTION WHEN THE LATTER IS REALITY SO ONE COULD ARGUE THAT A UNIVERSE WITH OUR LAWS OF PHYSICS IS THE SAME AS A SIMULATION AND THE DIFFERENCE IS ESSENTIALLY ONLY SEMANTICS EXCEPT WHEN YOU TIE IN SOME OTHER INTELLIGENT BEING RUNNING THE SIMULATION AND THAT INTELLIGENT BEING IS ARGUABLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE OR DISPROVE NOT THE SIMULATION PART AND SIMPLY BECOMES AN UNNECESSARY VARIABLE

I WAS HOPING FOR SOMETHING HARDER TO REFUTE

HE ASSUMES THAT THE VIRTUAL REALITY SHOULD SOMEHOW BE LIKE THE REAL ONE I DISAGREE IMO THE POINT OF A VIRTUAL REALITY IS AT LEAST TO AN EXTENT TO BE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE SEEN BEFORE

IF I PUT ON A THC VIVE OR AN COCCULUS RIFT AND FIND MYSELF IN A COMPLETELY UNFAMILIAR WORLD THE FACT THAT IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE THINGS I'VE EXPERIENCED BEFORE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE PROOF THAT I'M NOT IN A VIRTUAL REALITY

WITHIN THE MATRIX CONCEPTS LIKE BRAIN AND COMPUTER CAN EASILY EXIST WITHOUT BEING A REPRESENTATION OF SOMETHING OUTSIDE THE MATRIX THERE'S NO NEED TO TAKE THESE CONCEPTS LITERALLY I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE KEANU REEVES IN ORDER TO REALIZE THAT I'M PLUGGED INTO THE MATRIX

THERE'S NO NEED FOR A REAL BRAIN AND A REAL COMPUTER TO EXIST OUTSIDE THE MATRIX IT'S FALLACIOUS TO ASSUME THAT WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT OUTSIDE THE MATRIX LOOKS LIKE

IT'S EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT WE LITERALLY LIVE IN THE MATRIX AS DEPICTED IN THE MOVIE IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT REALITY IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE ASSUME IT TO BE
OR THE PERSON THAT MADE THE VIDEO IS PART OF THE MATRIX AND IS WORRIED THAT WE ARE BECOMING TOO CLOSE TO FIGURING THE MATRIX OUT AND IS TRYING TO PERSUADE US THAT IT ISN'T REAL TO COVER THEIR OWN ASS
THIS QUESTION IS ABSTRACTLY INTERESTING BUT PRACTICALLY USELESS ITS IS ESSENTIALLY HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT REALITY IS AND IT COMES DOWN TO HOW YOU WANT TO ANSWER THIS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WE CAN ONLY KNOW WHAT IS TRUE OR FACTUAL FROM OUR DIRECT EXPERIENCES SOMETIMES OR THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOMETIMES
THE CONFUCIAN AM I A MAN DREAMING IM A BUTTERFLY OR A BUTTERFLY DREAMING IM A MAN IS A COMPELLING QUESTION BUT ESSENTIAL THE ANSWER IS THERES NO WAY TO KNOW
BECAUSE UNLESS THE SIMULATION WAS DESIGNED TO SEE HOW LONG IT IS UNTIL WE FIND OUT IT IS A SIMULATION WHY WOULD WE EVEN BE ALLOWED TO DEVELOPED THE CONCEPT OF A SIMULATION
IS THIS ARGUMENT PREDICATED ON THE IDEA THAT TRUE REALITY CANNOT BE FAITHFUL RE-CREATED OR DID I MISS THE WHOLE POINT
OBVIOUSLY IT'S AN UNKNOWN WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE IN A SIMULATION AND I SORT OF LEAN TOWARDS UNKNOWABLE BUT IT DOES SEEM LOGICAL FOR A SPECIES AFTER REACHING A LEVEL OF PROFICIENT TECHNOLOGY TO OPT FOR A SIMULATION BASED ON THE SHEER EFFICIENCY OF IT ALL YOU MAKE ONE AND CAN SHARE IT WITH EVERYONE IF WE WERE JUST FED FOOD BY ROBOTS WHO FARMED AND WE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE REAL REALITY BECAUSE IN THE ARTIFICIAL ONE YOU GET TO RIDE DINOSAURS AND GO TO DIFFERENT PLANETS EXPLORING NEW JUNGLES AND WATERFALLS AND DAMN DOESN'T IT SOUND FUN ONCE THE GRAPHICS AND THE IMMERSION GETS TO A SUPER HIGH DEGREE AND THEN TRUE GAMERS WOULD WANT TO HAVE THEIR MEMORIES SECTIONED OFF SO THEY WOULD THINK ITS REAL FOR SUPER HARDCORE RUSHES ALL WITHOUT ENDANGERING YOUR BODY

SO EFFICIENT
HOW DOES HE CONCLUDE THAT A STATEMENT I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS FALSE JUST BECAUSE SUCH BRAIN DOESN'T HAVE CERTAINTY TO CLAIM SO HE STILL MIGHT BE A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER COULDN'T HE
IT'S REDUCIBLE TO THE HALTING PROBLEM
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT RECENTLY AND HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ANY VIRTUAL REALITY THAT CONTAINS CONSCIOUS VESSELS WOULD HAVE TO BE LITERALLY PERFECT IN ORDER TO HIDE THIS FACT FROM THOSE VESSELS INTERMINABLY AND SINCE CREATING SUCH A COMPLEX PROGRAMME TO LITERAL PERFECTION MUST LOGICALLY BE IMPOSSIBLE THEN SURELY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR OUR REALITY TO BE A SIMULATION IN WHICH NO ONE HAS EVER DISCOVERED THE SLIGHTEST LOGICAL IMPERFECTION OR IN TERMS GLITCH IN THE MATRIX
I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON SOME GOOD STUFF HERE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS IS THE SIMULATION THEORY IS JUST OUR VERSION OF WAGER RENE DESCARTES DEMIURGE IS SOMETIMES USED AS A DEFEAT OF WAGER WHICH TO VERY BRIEFLY SUM THAT UP WAGER IS GOD'S LOVE AND HEAVEN ARE INFINITE REWARDS FOR A LIFE LIVED BY CHRISTIAN VALUES ANYTHING TIMES INFINITY IS INFINITY THEREFORE EVEN IF THE CHANCE OF CHRISTIANITY EXISTING IS THE REWARDS ARE STILL INFINITE AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT HEAVEN EXISTS SHOULD ALWAYS BE MADE THE DEMIURGE ARGUMENT IS THAT WHAT IF THERE'S AN EVEN SMALLER CHANCE THAT THERE'S AN ALL POWERFUL DEMON WHO'S TRICKING EVERYONE AND HE DOES HAVE A HEAVEN TOO WITH INFINITE REWARDS BUT ONLY THOSE WHO REJECT ARGUMENTS MADE WITHOUT EVIDENCE EVEN IF THAT'S WAY LESS LIKELY IT'S STILL MULTIPLYING INFINITIES

SO FOR OUR CURRENT THOUGHT ON THE SIMULATION THEORY IS THAT THE CHANCES OF REAL TO SIMULATIONS OF REALITY EVENTUALLY BEING POSSIBLE MUST MEAN THAT THERE ARE NEARLY INFINITE MORE CHANCES OF REALITY BEING SIMULATED SINCE THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE BASE REALITY AND INFINITE LAYERS TO A SIMULATED REALITY OR BILLIONS OF SEPARATE SIMULATED REALITIES ON THE SAME LAYER THEN WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THIS BEING THE REAL REALITY I DON'T QUITE HAVE MY COUNTER ARGUMENT FORMULATED AGAINST THIS JUST YET BUT IT'S THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AS WAGER JUST WITH GOD REPLACED WITH SCIENCE WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE THEME THIS CENTURY JUST NEED MY DEMIURGE
THIS IS INCREDIBLY CIRCULAR UNLESS I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THE ARGUMENT

ALTERNATIVELY ASSUMING THIS A COMPUTATIONALLY FINITE SIMULATION THERE IS AN ENTROPY MAXIMUM IN THE SYSTEM THAT SIMULATES OUR UNIVERSE WHICH SEEMS TO BE TRUE BUT WE COULDN'T KNOW WITHOUT SEEING THE FUTURE BEYOND THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE IF THERE'S STILL UNIVERSE AS WE KNOW IT THERE IS NO ENTROPY LIMIT THEN WE CAN CALCULATE MORE AND MORE DIGITS OF IRRATIONAL VALUES LIKE 2 IF WE REACH AN END WHERE MORE DIGITS CANNOT BE CALCULATED THEN WE HAVE CONCLUSIVELY PROVEN THAT THE UNIVERSE IS SIMULATED
I THINK WE FIRST HAVE TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MATRIX IS AND WHAT ITS CHARACTERISTICS ARE AND INLY ONCE WE UNDERSTAND IT SOMETHING CAN BE PROVEN

IT IS LIKE SEEING AN UNKNOWN THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN OBJECT FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW COULD ONE ARGUE THIS UNKNOWN OBJECT ISNT SOME DIFFORMED CAR OR ANYTHING ELSE IF HE DOESN T EVEN KNOW UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SEES THE COMPARISON CAN ONLY BE MADE BECAUSE BOTH OBJECTS ARE KNOWN
WE ARE LIVING IN A PARTIAL SIMULATION OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY IS MODIFIED BY GOVERNMENT RADAR SEE BIOLOGICAL RADIOWAVES IN CIA MKULTRA PROJECT BECAUSE WE CAN DETECT THESE RADIOWAVES AS WELL AS KNOW ABOUT THE PLATFORMS THAT DELIVER THEM OVER THE HORIZON RADAR MOBILE PHONE TOWERS SATELLITE ETC
I'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION BEFORE AND WHILE I HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS CLIP THE ONE POINT THAT GOT ME IN PREVIOUS VIDEOS WAS THIS AN END TO PI

THEORETICALLY A SIMULATION WOULD HAVE A LIMITED MEMORY CAPACITY JUST LIKE OUR OWN COMPUTERS WHICH WOULD ROUND INFINITE NON REPEATING FLOATS ONCE THE MEMORY LIMIT HAS BEEN REACHED THE THEORY IS THAT IF WE WERE TO FIND AN END TO PI IT WOULD BE CONFIRMATION THAT THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN IS SIMULATED

I SEE PROBLEMS WITH THIS BUT THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERESTED POINT TO CONSIDER
THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS THAT WE WILL LIKELY NEVER KNOW IF WE'RE A OR OTHERWISE PUN INTENDED

I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MUCH DEEPER QUESTIONS THAT ARISE WITH THESE SIMULATED REALITY PROBLEMS THAN WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A SIMULATION

THE SIMULATED REALITY PREMISE MAKES US CHALLENGE OUR BELIEFS ON EPISTEMOLOGY AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF KNOWLEDGE THIS SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING FORGOTTEN AROUND HERE

NICE TRY ARCHITECT
IF WHAT THIS VIDEO SAYS IS AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF ARGUMENT I DISAGREE ISN'T THE CONCLUSION OF THE BRAIN IN A VAT THAT WE HAVE NO ACCURATE CONCEPTION OF REALITY IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN PUTNAM IS USING IT AS A PREMISE IN HIS CONCLUSION THAT WE ARE NOT BRAINS IN A VAT WHAT THE VIDEO SAYS TO ME IS THAT BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONCEIVE REALITY WE CANNOT IMAGINE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE SIMULATION THIS DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHETHER WE REALLY DO LIVE IN A SIMULATION THOUGH JUST THAT WE CAN'T EVER KNOW IF WE DO
THIS IS SOME BREATHTAKING EQUIVOCATION IF I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER CAN'T REFER TO THE EQUIVALENT OF A COMPUTER BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER SEEN ONE THEN ITS TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD HAS NO BEARING ON WHETHER I AM ACTUALLY A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO THE EQUIVALENT OF A COMPUTER

I MEAN THE WHOLE ARGUMENT RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT WE CAN'T REFER TO ANYTHING OUTSIDE OUR UNIVERSE AND YET SOMEHOW AS SOON AS HE USES THAT FACT TO DETERMINE THAT THE STATEMENT I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER MUST BE FALSE HE CONVENIENTLY FORGETS THE WHOLE PREMISE OF THE ARGUMENT AND DECIDES THAT IT CAN REFER TO AN COMPUTER EQUIVALENT THUS PROVING THAT WE ARE NOT IN FACT LIVING IN A SIMULATION

I MEAN AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE OR IS IT REALLY THAT STUPID
HE HAS SUCH A DRY MOUTH UUUGGHHHHHHH
THE TITLE OF THIS LINK AND THE GIST OF THE VIDEO ARE COMPLETELY OPPOSED
CAN'T WE GET PAST ALL THE DIFFICULTY OF BRAINS VATS AND COMPUTERS

THERE MAY BE A WORLD EXTERNAL TO OUR OWN IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD MAY EXIST MEANS TO RENDER FALSE PERCEPTIONS OUR REALITY MAY BE A FALSE PERCEPTION CREATED BY SOME SUCH MEANS

IS THIS SUBJECT TO THE SAME SCRUTINY

AND IF IT'S NOT CAN'T WE JUST CALL THIS HYPOTHETICAL MEANS TO RENDER FALSE PERCEPTIONS A COMPUTER KNOWING THAT WHAT WE MEAN BY IT IS NOT A LITERAL COMPUTER BUT ONLY SOME OBJECT OR ENTITY WHICH SERVES THAT PRESCRIBED FUNCTION
THIS IS RAPIDLY BECOMING A MOOT POINT AS WE ARE ABOUT TO REPLACE REALITY WITH A SIMULATION OR DIE TRYING
SO SPEAKING FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL VIEWPOINT THE TECHNOLOGY SIMULATING OUR UNIVERSE WOULD BE BUT STILL CONVENTIONAL AND BOUND BY OUR LIMITATIONS CORRECT

SO IF YOU LET'S SAY EXPLODED A WARHEAD ON AN INFINITELY LARGE SCALE YOU COULD LAG THE UNIVERSE AND PRICE THAT IT'S A SIMULATION RIGHT

YES IT'S NOT LOGICAL TO PRODUCE A BOMB THAT LARGE BY ANY MEANS BUT THAT WOULD BE A WAY TO PROVE IT I THINK
WHAT ABOUT TRYING TO LAG THE OUTER UNIVERSE
SO IF WE WERE LIVING G IN A MATRIX OF SORTS AND WE SAY OUR BRAIN IS HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER BUT ULTIMATELY THAT'S A LIE SINCE IT HAS NO CONCEPT OF BOTH THINGS MUST MAKE IT A LIE RIGHT WELL SURE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO AN EXTENT BECAUSE A BRAIN CAN BE ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT IT SHOULD STILL MEAN THE SAME SINCE WORDS BY THIS VIDEO LOGIC IS JUST A METAPHORICAL SO IF WE SAY BRAIN AND THINK OF A PINK BRAINING THING THEN THAT'S CAUSE WE ARE TOLD THAT'S HOW IT'S SUPPOSE TO LOOK BUT EVEN IF IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT BUT STILL FUNCTIONS AS A BRAIN THEN THE APPEARANCE WOULDN'T MATTER EXCEPT FOR THE FUNCTION OF IT
THE WORDS THAT YOU ONLY NEED TO KNOW WE DON'T KNOW SHIT AND WE WILL NEVER KNOW SHIT
TELL ME IF I'M SUMMARIZING THIS CORRECTLY

YOU CAN'T SAY YOU'RE IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION BECAUSE COMPUTERS ARE SOMETHING THAT EXISTS IN THE THING YOU'RE CALLING A SIMULATION NOT NECESSARILY OUTSIDE OF IT

MY ARGUMENT WOULD BE THAT AS LONG AS THERE ARE LAWS OF LOGIC IN WHATEVER WORLD OUR SIMULATION IS BEING RUN THEN IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT COMPUTES AND THEN YOU COULD CALL THAT A COMPUTER

OF COURSE I SEE HOW MUCH I'M PAINTING THE RULES OF THIS WORLD ONTO THAT THEORETICAL ONE BUT IT'S JUST A THOUGHT
WAIT A SECOND SAY I'M A BRAIN IN A VAT WHICH WAS GROWN BY SCIENTISTS AND THEREFORE NEVER HAD SENSORY ORGANS I COULD VERY WELL EXIST IN A WORLD WITHOUT EVER EXPERIENCING ANY OF IT OR KNOWING WHAT A TREE IS AS I AM PHYSICALLY INCAPABLE OF DOING SO HOWEVER AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD STILL BE HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER EXPERIENCING A SIMULATION AND BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THE WORLD IN WHICH I ACTUALLY EXIST I ASSUME THAT THE SIMULATED WORLD IS THE REAL ONE THEREFORE THE VERY IDEA THAT A BRAIN IN A VAT IN FACT PROVES THAT SIMULATION IS A POSSIBILITY BECAUSE I LACK EXPERIENCES THERE IS NO WAY FOR ME TO DETERMINE THAT I EXIST IN A MATERIAL AND SIMULATION PLANE BUT LET US ASSUME THAT I AM NOT IN FACT A BRAIN IN A VAT AND BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF MATERIAL EXPERIENCE I HAVE COMPLETELY MISPLACED WHAT I ACTUALLY AM THAT DOESN'T MEAN THOUGH THAT I AM NOT FOR INSTANCE AN ADVANCED AI SO ULTIMATELY THERE IS NO WAY TO PROVE WITHOUT SOME INTERVENTION WHETHER OR NOT I AM IN A SIMULATION
THE ARGUMENT I MIGHT BE AN ENTITY THAT I CANNOT PERCEIVE CONNECTED TO A DEVICE I CANNOT PERCEIVE CANNOT BE PROVEN FALSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LEAP OF LOGIC IN THIS VIDEO THAT SAYS THAT THE STATEMENT I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS FALSE

IF A PERSON WAS BOUND AND GAGGED AND PUT IN A DARK ROOM AND WAS UNABLE TO SEE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE ROOM AND A CLOWN HAPPENED TO BE STANDING NEXT TO THEM AND THEY THOUGHT I AM NEXT TO A CLOWN IT WOULD HAPPEN TO BE TRUE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE NO WAY OF VERIFYING THIS

I CAN ABIDE BY THE NOTION THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WORTH THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE IN A SIMULATION BECAUSE WE CANNOT VERIFY THE NOTION BUT I REJECT THE IDEA THAT IT IS FALSE PRECISELY BECAUSE WE CANNOT VERIFY THE VERACITY OF THE NOTION

LIKEWISE THE ARGUMENT FALLS APART IF WE CONSIDER A SIMULATION THAT PERFECTLY REPRESENTS THE CONCEPT OF THINGS THAT EXIST OUTSIDE OF THE SIMULATION TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND FULLY WHAT THEY ARE IF A COMPUTER AND A BRAIN OUTSIDE OF THE SIMULATION ARE REPRESENTED PERFECTLY WITHIN AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE CONTEXT OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING WITHIN THE SIMULATION THEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF A BRAIN AND OF A COMPUTER WITHIN THE SIMULATION AND OUTSIDE OF THE SIMULATION WOULD BE ONE AND THE SAME THEREFORE WE COULD MAKE THE SAME LOGICAL INFERENCES REGARDLESS OF CONTEXT
THIS FALLS UNDER THE INCOMPLETENESS THEOREM FROM KURT GODEL IT ESSENTIALLY STATES ATTEMPTING TO PROVE AN AXIOM FROM WITHIN THE SYSTEM IS IMPOSSIBLE REALLY DEEP SHIT AND WORTH CHECKING OUT
THIS IS BASICALLY THE GOD ARGUMENT THE EXISTENCE OF ANY GIVEN DEITY CAN NEITHER BE PROVEN NOR DISPROVEN SO HAVING THE ARGUMENT IS POINTLESS
THIS MAKES ME THINK THE ENTITY IN CHARGE OF MY SIMULATION IS TRYING TO KEEP ME FROM FIGURING IT OUT LIKE THAT SCENE IN TOTAL RECALL WHERE ARNOLD ENCOUNTERS THE GUY TRYING TO CONVINCE ARNOLD HE'S STUCK IN THE DREAM WORLD
ITS ASHAME BECAUSE SOMETIMES I WISH THIS SHIT WASNT REAL
AS A FRENCH GUY I'VE GOTTA SAY WELL DONE TO THE GUY WHO MADE THIS VIDEO AND MANAGED TO PRONOUNCE DESCARTES CORRECTLY SO MANY PEOPLE GET IT WRONG ANYWAY VERY COOL VIDEO
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT REALITY IS A SIMULATION OUR PERCEPTION OF REALITY IS SIMULATED WHAT YOU SEE AS YOU LOOK AROUND YOUR ROOM IS NOT WHAT'S ACTUALLY THERE IT'S ONLY WHAT YOU CAN PERCEIVE THERE ARE COUNTLESS OTHER THINGS PRESENT RADIATION PARTICLES COLOURS ALL SORTS OF THINGS WE CAN'T SEE YOUR CLOTHES IN YOUR WARDROBE ARE THERE YET YOU CAN'T SEE THEM UNLESS THE DOOR IS OPEN ALL WE SEE IS WHAT LIGHT IS REFLECTED OFF OF WE HAVE HEARING TO SENSE SOUND BUT EVEN SOUND WE EXPERIENCE IN A LIMITED WAY AS IN WE CAN'T SEE OR FEEL IT EVENING WE HAVE NO SENSE TO DETECT RADIATION FOR ALL WE KNOW THERE MAY BE THINGS HERE EVEN OUR INSTRUMENTS CAN'T DETECT THERE COULD BE CREATURES LIVING AMONG US THAT WE AREN'T AWARE OF BECAUSE WE HAVE NO TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT THEM YET

IMAGINE IF YOU COULD SEE LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE THING PRESENT IN YOUR ROOM WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE YOU COULD SEE EVERY SINGLE PARTICLE THAT MAKES UP YOUR CARPET FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD BE AN INSANE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO PROCESS HENCE WHY ONLY A MINIMAL AMOUNT IS DETECTED BY OUR BRAINS AND SIMULATED AS OUR ENVIRONMENT AROUND US

ALSO JUST BECAUSE LIGHT IS THE FASTEST THING WE'VE MEASURED DOESN'T MEAN THAT IS THE UNIVERSAL SPEED LIMIT WE MAY ONE DAY DETECT SOMETHING THAT IS MOVING FASTER THAN LIGHT THAT'S LIKE SAYING FUSAIN BOLT IS THE FASTEST I'VE EVER SEEN SOMEONE RUN THEREFORE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANOTHER HUMAN TO RUN FASTER THAN THAT NO IT ISN'T
PERSONALLY I THINK WE DON'T LIVE IN A SIMULATION WHY BECAUSE I CAN ONLY SEE TWO PURPOSES OF BUILDING A SIMULATION TO TEST PEOPLE'S REACTION TO KNOWING IT WAS A SIMULATION HIGH IS OBVIOUSLY NOT THE CASE OR TO CREATE A WORLD TO SIMULATE RESPONSES TO REAL WORLD STIMULI IN THE LATER CASE IT WOULD BE IMPERATIVE THAT THE PEOPLE IN HE SIMULATION NOT KNOW IT WAS A SIMULATION AND SEEING AS PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BEEN QUESTIONING THIS FOR DECADES I THINK THAT IT COULDN'T BE THE SECOND ONE EITHER NOT A PROOF JUST MY TWO CENTS
SO BASICALLY IF I'VE NEVER SEEN A HORSE THERE IS NO HORSE
LIVING IN A SIMULATION WOULD MEAN THAT EVERY SINGLE PARTICLE IN THE UNIVERSE IS SIMULATED AND NOT JUST FROM THE EARTH EVERY SINGLE PARTICLE IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE THAT IS JUST TOO MUCH WE ARE NOT LIVING IN A SIMULATION
THIS IS DUMB ALL IT'S SAYING IS TECHNICALLY BASED ON A LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF YOUR EXACT WORDS YOU'RE INCORRECT
A FEW POINTS

WHATEVER IS GENERATING THE SIMULATION WOULD BE IN A DIFFERENT UNIVERSE PERMANENTLY AND COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF OUR ABILITY TO DETECT IT
2 WHATEVER IS GENERATING THE SIMULATION WOULD LIKELY BE IN A UNIVERSE SO DIFFERENT FROM OURS AND LIKELY SO MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN OURS THAT ANY EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BE FUTILE
IN A PRACTICAL SENSE IT DOES NOT MATTER IF WE LIVE IN A SIMULATION IT STANDS TO REASON THAT SIMULATED UNIVERSES WOULD BE INCREDIBLY MORE COMMON THAN REAL ONES BUT THE PROGRAMMING IS VERY REAL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE
WHATEVER UNIVERSE IS GENERATING OUR SIMULATION IS ALSO ITSELF LIKELY A SIMULATION
LAO YOU DON'T NEED MINUTES TO EXPLAIN WHY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT
HONESTLY ONE OF THE DUMBEST PHILOSOPHICAL TOPICS I'VE EVER COME ACROSS CAN'T THINK OF A MORE POINTLESS WASTE OF TIME STONER TIER PHILOSOPHY HONESTLY
THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE NOT THAT WE DON'T LIVE IN A SIMULATION BUT THAT IT'S MEANINGLESS TO SAY WHETHER WE ARE LIVING IN A SIMULATION BUT I STILL DISAGREE

AT ITS CORE THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE THAT IT'S NOT MEANINGFUL TO SAY THAT WE LIVE IN A SIMULATION BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE IN A SIMULATION WE CAN'T SAY THAT WE MIGHT BE BRAINS IN VATS BECAUSE THE STATEMENT WOULD IMPLY THAT WE KNEW WHAT REAL BRAINS OR REAL VATS MIGHT BE WHICH WE DON'T

I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THAT WE CAN IMAGINE OURSELVES SIMULATING AN ARTIFICIAL REALITY WITHIN OUR OWN WORLD IMAGINE BEINGS LIVING WITHIN THAT SIMULATED REALITY AND IMAGINE SOME GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THAT REALITY WHICH COULD BE EXPERIENCED BY THOSE SIMULATED BEINGS EVIDENCE THAT OUR OWN WORLD POSSESSES THOSE SAME GENERAL PROPERTIES COULD BE CONSTRUED AS VERY WEAK EVIDENCE WE'RE IN A SIMULATION

FOR EXAMPLE IN MANY SIMULATED WORLDS THAT I CAN IMAGINE EAST G COMPUTER SIMULATIONS LIKE THE MATRIX THE OPERATOR OF A SIMULATION WOULD ESSENTIALLY POSSESS GODLIKE POWER OVER THE SIMULATION SO THE EXISTENCE OF A GODLIKE BEING ESPECIALLY ONE WHO COULD COMMUNICATE WITH US AND CLAIM THAT WE INHABIT A SIMULATION WOULD TO ME BE EVIDENCE THAT WE ARE SIMULATIONS
I DON'T THINK THIS IS A REAL ARGUMENT YOU CAN THEN SAY OUR BRAIN TYPE THING IS HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER TYPE THING JUST BECAUSE WE MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT A COMPUTER IN THE REAL WORLD LOOKS LIKE DOESN'T MEAN THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT IS INVALID ALL IT MEANS IS THAT THE REAL WORLD MAY BE VASTLY DIFFERENT TO THE SIMULATED ONE
WHO'S TO SAY THAT SIMULATION IS NOT

A YEARS COULD BE SPENT DECODING THE MYSTERY OF THE SIMULATION WITH AN ANSWER SEEMINGLY FOUND NOT REALIZING IT'S A SIMULATION OF A SIMULATION OF A SIMULATION ETC
REAL TREES WHERE LIGHT IS ABSORBED AND EMITTED HITS OUR EYES WHICH CONVERTS IT TO ELECTRICAL SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN ANYWAYS

WHY WOULD THE SOURCE MATTER

IF A COMPUTER SENT A ELECTRICAL SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN THAT A TREE WAS A CIRCLE AND IT'S CALLED A FROG BECAUSE HISTORY OF THE SIMULATION SUGGESTS THAT IT WAS THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL THAT IT IMPLANTS IT IN AND PASTED IT ON

WHY WOULD WE REJECT THAT IT SEEMS WEIRD USING THE TERM REAL IF WE ARE TALKING THINGS IN TERMS OF SIMULATION WHERE DOES REAL COME IN TO PLAY
THE SIMPLE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU'D BE USING METRICS PROVIDED BY THE SIMULATION ITSELF
REMINDS ME OF THOUGHTS ABOUT OUR ACCESS TO THE METAPHYSICAL
ACTUALLY WE ARE A SIM INSIDE A SIM INSIDE A BRAIN IN A JAR
I THINK THIS WHOLE ARGUMENT SORT OF UNDERCUTS ITSELF JUST AFTER THE MINUTE MARK HE ARGUES SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF WHEN A MARTIAN SAYS TREE IT IS NOT REFERRING TO A REAL TREE BUT TO THE SENSE EXPERIENCE GIVEN TO IT BY THE ELECTRICAL IMPULSES RECEIVED FROM THE COMPUTER THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT BUT THAT IS ALSO PRECISELY WHAT WE BELIEVE THE BRAIN DOES NOW OUR NEURONS HAVE NEVER SEEN THE WORLD THEY CREATE A SENSUAL EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD SOMEHOW BASED ON ELECTRICAL CODE RECEIVED FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD WE LITERALLY LIVE IN A BLACK BOX AND CAN ONLY CONSTRUCT OUR ENVIRONMENT BASED ON CODE SENT TO US WE CAN BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE CONSTRUCT IN OUR MINDS WHEN WE SEE A TREE CORRESPONDS TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY OUT THERE IN THE MATERIAL WORLD BUT I CAN'T THINK OF ANY SOLID REASON TO BELIEVE IT'S TRUE OUTSIDE OF SOME SORT OF FAITH BASED POSITION
SAY THAT MARTIAN WAS GIVEN AN COCCULUS RIFT AND SHOWN WHAT A TREE WAS LIKE OR WAS TO STUDY TREES FOR YEARS WITHOUT EVER ACTUALLY TOUCHING A TREE WOULD WE STILL MAKE THE SAME CLAIMS

DOES THIS REALLY HINGE ON THE QUALITY OF THE SIMULATION NEVER BEING ABLE TO REACH PERFECTION
MATRIX IS A MOVIE REALITY IS A SIMULATION AT A UNIVERSAL LEVEL THE PART OF THE SIM THAT'S THE WORLD ABOVE IS A SPIRITUAL REALM GOD STARTED A SIM BILLIONS OR TRILLIONS OF YEARS AGO AND THAT'S JUST THE UNIVERSE MANY UNIVERSES EXISTED AT THE START THE TRICK IS REALIZING THERE IS DUALITY SPIRITS AND THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE EXIST BUT HAVE A VERY HARD TIME INTERACTING
I DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT

MAYBE I'VE GOT SOMETHING WRONG SO DEFINITELY TELL ME IF I HAVE BUT I DON'T THINK THAT ARGUMENT FOLLOWS

FOR EXAMPLE IMAGINE PERSON A HAS BEEN IN THE SIMULATION THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AS IN THEY HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING BUT THE SIMULATION IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THE ARGUMENT IS THAT EVEN IF THAT PERSON IS IN A SIMULATION THAT'S IDENTICAL TO REALITY THEY CAN'T MAKE THE CLAIM THAT THEIR IN A SIMULATION BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED REALITY

I THINK IT FALLS APART WHEN YOU IMAGINE PERSON B TO BE SOMEONE THAT HAS EXPERIENCED REALITY BUT WAS PUT IN A SIMULATION AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE WITHOUT KNOWING IT IF THEY THEN CLAIM THAT THEY ARE IN A SIMULATION WHAT CAN WE SAY ABOUT IT

PERSON A AND PERSON B MAKE THE SAME CLAIM BUT PERSON B HAS A VALID CLAIM APPARENTLY THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ME BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMAGINING REALITY EVEN THOUGH ONE HAS EXPERIENCED IT WITH KNOWING

IF WE TAKE THIS EVEN FURTHER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PERSON B EXPERIENCES SOMETHING IN THE SIMULATION THAT THEY HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED IN REALITY CAN THEY STILL MAKE THE CLAIM THEY LIVE IN A SIMULATION THE SIMULATION HAS GIVEN THEM AN EXPERIENCE THAT WASN'T REAL BUT IS PLAUSIBLE WITHIN THE REALITY THEY HAD EXPERIENCED BEFORE THE SIMULATION

IF I WAS TO USE THE ALIEN ANALOGY IT WOULD BE LIKE THE ALIEN FINDS A PICTURE OF A TREE WITH A SPACESHIP IN THE BACKGROUND THE SPACESHIP IS A DEPICTION OF SOMETHING THE ALIEN KNOWS TO BE TRUE THE TREE IS SOMETHING IT HAS NEVER SEEN BUT BELIEVES IT COULD EXIST ALONG SIDE THE SPACESHIP

LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK IF I MISSED SOMETHING OR SOMETHING DOESN'T FOLLOW THEN TELL ME THAT TOO


THIS SEEMS ODDLY SEMANTIC IF THE OBJECTS BRAIN AND COMPUTER ARE SO IMPORTANT THEN WE CAN AVOID THAT SHORTCOMING BY DEFINING THEM BY THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR FUNCTION

I AM A CONTROL CENTER OF SOME UNKNOWN FUNCTION HOOKED UP TO A DEVICE CONTROLLING MY PERCEPTION OF REALITY

THE CRUX OF THE PREMISE IN THIS VIDEO IS ASSUMING THAT WE NEED TO KNOW ANY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OBJECTS IN TRUE REALITY WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE LIKE TO KNOW THAT THEY EXIST THIS IS PROVEN OFTEN IN ASTRONOMY PHYSICS AND A MULTITUDE OF SCIENCES



AFTER READING THROUGH THE COMMENTS I DO SEE THAT THE PURPOSE IS TO PROVE AND BASED ON CONVENTIONAL LOGIC I GUESS YOU COULDN'T WRITE A SUCCESSFUL PROOF BASED ON THE PREMISES GIVEN IN THIS VIDEO
WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT IT IGNORES ONE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF THE MATRIX IN ITS ARGUMENT

THE IDEA THAT A MARTIAN HASN'T SEEN AN ACTUAL TREE OR HEARD OF THE WORD TREE REFERRING TO AN ACTUAL ONE IS IRRELEVANT THE SIMULATION WAS MEANT TO BE CONVINCING ENOUGH THAT EVEN IF THEY HAD EXPERIENCED A REAL TREE WHEN FACED WITH A SIMULATION IT WOULD BE INDISTINGUISHABLE SO THEY COULD TRANSPOSE THEIR EXPECTATION FROM THE REAL TO THE SIMULATED EASILY AND VICE VERSA

THE DESCARTES MODEL ASSUMES THE SAME

TRYING TO IMPLY A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF ABSOLUTE VALUE ONTO THE TREE OR WORDS MEANS NOTHING WHEN THE THING EVALUATING THE AUTHENTICITY IS SUITABILITY DECEIVED

FOR THE SIMULATION COSMIC RAY ARGUMENT TO STAND UP IT WOULD NEED US TO ASSUME THE GOAL OF THE SIMULATION WAS DIRECTED AT SIMULATING A REALISTIC UNIVERSE AND NOT AT FOOLING THE INDIVIDUAL

IF THE BRAIN IN A JAR VERSION OOF REALITY WAS ACCURATE THEN THOSE RESULTS WOULD ALAGE BE MANIPULATED IN A WAY TO MAINTAIN THE ILLUSION

IF HOWEVER LIVING BEINGS WERE A BYPRODUCT OF THE SIMULATION THEN THEORETICALLY WE WERE NOT ANTICIPATED SO OUR EXPERIENCE MAY NOT BE TARGETED FOR SENSORY MANIPULATION NECESSARY TO DECEIVE US

BASICALLY YOU MUST BE A GLITCH IN THE MATRIX TO BE ABLE TO PERCEIVE THE MATRIX SANS RED PILL BLUE PILL CHOICE
CAN WE QUANTIFY OUR LEVEL OF CONSCIOUS UNDERSTANDING OUTSIDE OUR OWN CONCEPTUALIZED UNDERSTANDING THE SHIT PART OF ALL OF IT IS THAT OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE CONCEPTS IS SO LIMITED
HE MAKES A SEVERE ERROR AT THE BASIS OF HIS ARGUMENT IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE THEREFORE IT IS FALSE IS NOT AN ARGUMENT
THE WHOLE THE TREE THAT WE SEE BIT REMINDS ME OF R MISLEADINGTHUMBNAILS
KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE WAS THAT AT ALL MENTIONED IN THE AID
KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE WAS THAT AT ALL MENTIONED IN THE AID
EXCEPT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS AND THE CONCEPT FOR THE MATRIX IS THAT IN THE MATRIX THE REALITY WAS A BUNCH OF HUMANS CONNECTED TO A SIMULATION WHEREAS I'D INTERPRETED THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS TO MEAN THAT OUR ENTIRE EXISTENCE AND WE KNOW DOES NOT ACTUALLY EXIST AT ALL FOR THAT REASON I THINK THAT THE MATRIX IS A POOR ANALOGY
BY THE SAME RATIONALE A CHICKEN IN A FACTORY FARM CAN DEDUCE THAT IT IS NOT IN A FACTORY FARM BECAUSE IT HAS NEVER SEEN THE OUTSIDE WORLD SO IT HAS NO CONCEPT OF IT



I DISAGREE

THE VIDEO SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T EXPERIENCE THE WORLD VIA COMPUTER SIMULATION YET ITS DEFINITION OF EXPERIENCING THE WORLD IS JUST ELECTRIC SIGNALS GOING FROM ONE'S EYES EARS AND ANY OTHER SENSORY NERVES TO THEIR BRAIN

THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT AN EXACT REPLICA OF THESE ELECTRIC IMPULSES BUT CREATED VIA A MACHINE WOULD CAUSE YOUR BRAIN TO EXPERIENCE THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY

IF THAT'S THE CASE AND IT IS THEN THIS SAME ARGUMENT COULD BE APPLIED TO THE STATEMENT I AM LIVING IN A SIMULATION THE REAL WORLD AND THEN ONE COULD SAY THERE FOR WE MUSTN'T BE LIVING IN THE REAL WORLD
GET YOUR FILTHY MACHINE PROPAGANDA OUT OF HERE
HE KEEPS SAYING THAT FOR THIS TO BE A SIMULATION YOU NEED TO BE A REAL ORGANIC CONSCIOUSNESS HOOKED UP TO COMPUTER A BRAIN IN A JAR BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE OURSELVES INCLUDED COULD BE ENTIRELY SIMULATED WITHOUT ANY EXTERNAL OBJECTS INVOLVED JUST LIKE AN AI WOULD BE IF WE BUILT ONE
I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS ONLY WRONG IF WE ASSUME THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OUR IDEA OF A BRAIN AND OUT IDEA OF A COMPUTER IT'S PERFECTLY POSSIBLE THAT WE ARE IN FACT HOOKED UP TO SOME KIND OF PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF IF IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF ALL THIS GUY PROVES IS THAT THE STATEMENT ISN'T EXACTLY CORRECT IN THAT IT POSSIBLY WON'T BE WHAT WE THINK OF AS A BRAIN COMPUTER
DELETED
THERE IS A CLEAR SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENT TO BE MADE IN THAT WE DO LIVE IN A SIMULATION AND THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN RECENTLY ISH USING QUANTUM PHYSICS

BASICALLY THIS EXPERIMENT WAS A REPEAT OF THE EXPERIMENT IN WHICH PARTICLES BEGIN ACTING LIKE WAVES BUT WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS THE RESEARCHERS SETUP AN ELABORATE MAZE FOR PARTICLES TO JUST THROUGH WITH RANDOM TURNS THAT HAVE A CHANCE OF GOING WAY VS ANOTHER IN THIS THEY ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM IN WHICH IF THEY DETECTED A PARTICLE WITH SENSOR A OR B THEY COULD CALCULATE EXACTLY WHERE THE PARTICLE ORIGINATED FROM

IF A PARTICLE WAS HOWEVER FOUND AT DETECTORS C OR D THEN IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHERE THE PARTICLE CAME FROM

THE RESULTS SENSORS A AND B BOTH DEMONSTRATED A WHILE SENSORS C AND D WERE SHOWING A IN SHORT REGARDLESS OF HOW COMPLICATED THE PATH MAZE WAS IF SOMETHING CAN BE MEASURED WITH A CERTAINTY IT WILL ALWAYS ACT AS A PARTICLE WHEREAS IF SOMETHING CANNOT BE MEASURED WITH CERTAINTY IT ACTS AS A WAVE

TL R IT HAS BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN EITHER WE MUST BE LIVING IN A SIMULATIONS OR PARTICLES HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO CHANGE THEIR POSITION UPON OBSERVATION OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THESE TWO IS MORE LIKELY THAN THE OTHER
I DON'T EVER UNDERSTAND WHY IT WOULD MATTER WHETHER WE WERE OR NOT THERE ARE STILL FUNCTIONS EITHER BASED OFF OF FREE WILL OR DETERMINISM AND IT'S ALL STILL AN ABSTRACT OR EMPIRICAL REALITY THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND AND THROUGH CERTAIN UNDERSTANDINGS ALSO CREATE WHETHER IT BE A SIMULATION OR NOT I COULD SEE WHY IT WOULD MATTER IF IT WERE FOR THE REDEMPTION OF MANIPULATION BY A CORRUPT FORCE OR THE NEED TO CONSTANTLY INCREASE GRANDIOSE SYMPTOMS BUT BESIDES THAT EITHER WAY YOU'RE INFLUENCING A REALITY THAT IS ULTIMATELY YOURS AND JUST AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE NEXT

BLDR IF IT'S AN INFLUENTIAL REALITY WITH NO ABSOLUTE CONCRETE FUNCTION THEN WHY DOES IT MATTER
THANK YOU FOR WASTING MY TIME
IT ISN'T TESTABLE SO IT CAN'T BE ANSWERED

THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE SPEAKING ABOUT GOD IN THAT WHATEVER GOD IS CONSISTENTLY EVADES A TESTABLE DEFINITION TO BE EITHER ATHEIST OR THEIST IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS A ASSUMPTION MAINTAINING DOUBT IS THE ONLY VALID CONCLUSION

THE SAME GOES FOR THE SIMULATION HYPOTHESIS IT MAY BE LOGICAL BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S TRUE PLENTY OF LOGICAL THINGS THAT CAN BE PREDICTED WITH MATHEMATICS AND SCIENTIFIC THEORIES ARE VERY WRONG LOGIC DOESN'T MAKE SOMETHING REAL
WELL UNLESS SOMEONE COULD PROVE THAT WE DO IT'D BE PRETTY HARD TO ANSWER THAT FULLY THOUGH TO BE FAIR I DO QUESTION WHETHER OUR LIVES IS VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO THE GAME BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SO MUCH RANDOM STUFF GOING ON AT TIMES IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S REAL
BEL

TO THE CHITTER THIS GOES
THE LOGIC IN THE VIDEO WAS AUTE FLAWED FOR EXAMPLE IT IS ASSUMING THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF A DISTINCTION BETWEEN YOU EXPERIENCING A TREE VISUALLY SENSORY SMELL ETC AND YOUR BRAIN EXPERIENCING THE APPROPRIATE SIGNAL INPUT THERE JUST ISNT ANY DIFFERENCE THERE AND THUS THE WHOLE THING IS JUST PLAIN WRONG
SO BY HIS LOGIC IF YOU TAKE A VIRTUAL MACHINE IN A COMPUTER EVERYTHING INSIDE THAT MACHINE CAN ONLY CONCLUDE THE VM IS THE REAL WORLD AND NOTHING EXISTS OUTSIDE OF IT BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED THAT WAY AND THEREFORE IT'S TRUE THAT THE INSIDE OF THE VM IS TRUE THAT'S A HARSH CONCLUSION TO DRAW IF YOU LIMIT YOUR TRAIN OF THOUGHT TO WHAT YOU CAN PERCEIVE
THIS ONLY LOGICALLY ARGUES THAT WE ARE NOT PHYSICAL BEINGS LIVING IN SIMULATED REALITY

HOWEVER IT DOES NOT PROVE THAT WE ARE NOT SIMULATIONS LIVING IN SIMULATION
DOESN'T MATTER THE SIMULATION IS AN IDEA THAT HAS TAKEN HOLD WITH RELIGIOUS FERVOR LITERALLY THEY BELIEVE IT AND THAT'S THAT YOU'LL NEVER CONVINCE THOSE BELIEVERS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE YOU CAN'T PROVE A NEGATIVE ETC
MIRACLES WERE A THING UNTIL SOME FINALLY FUCKING CHANGED THE ADMIN PASSWORD
I DON'T THINK THAT THE ARGUMENT THAT WE CANNOT MAKE ANY FORM OF LOGICALLY VALID STATEMENT ABOUT THE REAL WORLD IF WE WERE INSIDE SOME SORT OF MATRIX PROVES THAT WE ARE NOT INSIDE ONE PROVES THAT WE ARE NOT INSIDE ONE IT MERELY PROVES THAT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT THE REAL WORLD IS LIKE IF WE WERE INSIDE ONE
JUST BECAUSE I AM A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A COMPUTER IS FALSE DOESN'T MEAN THAT SOME OTHER STATEMENT IMPLYING THAT WE ARE IN SOME SORT OF SIMULATION ISN'T TRUE
ITS VERY POSSIBLE THAT SOME SITUATION EXISTS USING AN ARRANGEMENT OBJECTS BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER SEEN REAL OBJECTS AND THAT SITUATION IS HAPPENING TO US RIGHT NOW
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THIS IT'S THE CONCEPT OF LIVING IN A SIMULATION THAT'S IMPORTANT I FEEL LIKE THIS ARGUMENT RESTS WHOLLY ON SEMANTICS MAYBE BRAINS AND JARS ARE UNIMAGINABLY DIFFERENT TO WHAT WE CALL BRAINS AND JARS BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE SENTIMENT OF BEING A BRAIN IN A JAR WHATEVER FORM THAT MAY TAKE UNDERSTANDING DOESN'T EQUATE TO TRUTH
SO IF WE GO FROM THE FACT THAT WE'RE LIVING IN A SIMULATION AND WE SAY I'M A BRAIN HOOKED UP TO A MACHINE WHICH IS FALSE THEN ONLY THE MEANING IN THE REFERENCED WORLD THE ONES OF THE MACHINES IS FALSE IF WE'RE LIVING IN A SIMULATION THAT'S POINT AND CASE WHATEVER STATEMENT YOU MAKE AFTER THAT IS UNNECESSARY

IN THE THE WHOLE ARGUMENT ABOUT LIVING IN A SIMULATION OR NOT BOILS DOWN TO 2 QUESTIONS IS THERE A PHYSICAL LIMIT OF WHAT WE CAN SIMULATE PRECISION AND CAN WE SIMULATE A BRAIN AND OTHER COMPLEX RELATIONS COMPLEXITY AND EVEN THEN IF THERE WERE A LIMIT LETS SAY A MINIMAL PROCESSING SPEED THE ONE LIVING IN THE SIMULATION COULDN'T KNOW WE COULD ASSUME THE SPEED OF LIGHT IS THE PROCESSING SPEED OF OUR UNIVERSE BUT OUTSIDE OF OUR SIMULATION THINGS COULD GO MUCH FASTER
SIMILARLY WITH THE COMPLEXITY MAYBE THIS IS ALL VERY COMPLEX TO US BUT OUTSIDE OF THE SIMULATION MAYBE BRAINS WORK IN A MORE COMPLEX MANNER AND SIMULATION PROBLEMS WOULD SEEM TRIVIAL OUTSIDE OF IT

IN THE END AND IN MY OPINION IT'S FAIR TO SAY THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT WE LIVE IN A SIMULATION BUT IT'S STILL ONLY A POSSIBILITY IN THE SAME MANNER AS IT IS A POSSIBILITY THAT ALL OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IS JUST HAPPENING IN YOUR HEAD YES YOU MR READER
DIDN'T WATCH THE VIDEO BUT WHY WOULD ANYONE THING IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
THIS IS ABOUT AS VIABLE AS LIVING ON A FLAT EARTH
I THINK THE ARGUMENT FAILS BECAUSE IT ASSUMES THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE MATRIX AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS A PERFECT ONE WHERE NO INFORMATION CAN PASS FROM OUT TO IN WHEREAS ANY SUCH MATRIX NECESSARILY EXISTS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND THEREFORE ALL OF ITS INFORMATION ORIGINATES FROM THIS OUTSIDE WORLD

TAKE THE ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE BY PLATO WHICH THIS VIDEO SAYS IS ONE OF THE CONCEPTS WHICH GAVE BIRTH TO THIS IDEA OF A SIMULATION THE SHADOWS ON THE WALL OF THE CAVE ARE BEING CAST BY OBJECTS FROM OUTSIDE THE CAVE IT'S JUST THAT THE INFORMATION IS INCOMPLETE
IT'S LOGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE ANY THEORY TRUE ALL THAT MATTERS IS WHETHER A THEORY IS FALSIFIABLE OR NOT SCIENCE DOES NOT OPERATE ON PROOFS AND LAWS THESE DAYS TAKE THE THEORY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY IT HASN'T BEEN PROVEN TRUE BECAUSE THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE IT CAN ONLY BE TESTED SO FAR IT HOLDS UP TO ANY TEST THAT CAN CURRENTLY BE DEVISED STILL IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT ONE DAY A BETTER OR MORE ACCURATE THEORY IS DISCOVERED

THIS GUY ISN'T BRINGING SOME NEW REVELATION TO THE TABLE USUALLY WE JUST GO WITH THE THEORY OR EXPLANATION THAT BEST FITS ALL AVAILABLE DATA EVEN BETTER IF THAT THEORY CAN BE TESTED AND IT MAKES PREDICTIONS NO OTHER THEORY CAN THEREFORE SIMULATION IS THE WINNER IN THAT RESPECT AS IT IS TESTABLE AND EXPLAINS ALL AVAILABLE DATA WHILE PROVIDING SIMILAR PREDICTIVE POWER INASMUCH AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROVE THIS IS A SIMULATION OR PROVE ANY THEORY IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE

BY THE WAY THE BASE REALITY IS DESCRIBABLE BECAUSE WE LIVE THERE TO SAY THAT TALKING ABOUT IT IS POINTLESS BECAUSE IT IS UNKNOWABLE IS A RED HERRING SCIENTISTS TALK ABOUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE UNKNOWABLE A NOTABLE EXAMPLE BEING THE BIG BANG IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT IS KNOWABLE VS WHAT IS UNKNOWABLE IT'S ABOUT WHAT CAN REASONABLY BE LOGICALLY DEDUCED FROM AVAILABLE DATA

FOR EXAMPLE SPACE IS NOT FUNDAMENTAL IF THIS IS A SIMULATION IT'S SIMPLY NUMBERS IN A COMPUTER DEFINE ORTHOGANAL X Y AND Z AND AN ORIGIN POINT AND THERE'S SPACE THEREFORE THE FUNDAMENTAL REALITY SINCE IT IS NOT A SIMULATION HAS NO SPACE THERE'S ONE BASIC CONCEPT THAT IS HARD TO WRAP ONE'S HEAD AROUND BUT LOGICALLY NECESSARY GIVEN THE FACTS
AN EASIER ANALOGY

TRY IMAGINING A NEW COLOUR IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE WE CAN'T IMAGINE SOMETHING THAT NEVER EXISTED
THAT'S LIKE SAYING YOU HAVE NO PROOF THEREFORE THEREFORE YOUR HYPOTHESIS IS CERTAINLY FALSE

IT IS NOT A FULL PROOF THAT YOU ARE NOT IT IS SIMPLY NEAR IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE THAT YOU MAY NOT BE NOT THE SAME THING
AT IT SHOULD BE NOR
SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY SPENDING MY TAX DOLLARS TO TRY AND DISPROVE THAT WE'RE LIVING IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION
YEAH WELL THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS NOT ON US WHO SAY THIS IS REAL
WOW THIS IS SO STUPID AND IT'S SO OBVIOUS WE ARE LIVING IN A SIMULATION IMAGINE A GTA CHARACTER BECAME SELF AWARE AND REALIZED WHAT A CAR ACTUALLY IS THEY WOULD PERCEIVE IT IN THEIR MATRIX WORLD THE SAME AS WE PERCEIVE IT IN THE REAL WORLD BECAUSE WE THE SIMULATION CREATORS ALSO CREATED IT HUMANS ARE A BAG OF CHEMICALS WE CAN SIMULATE THOSE EXACT SAME CHEMICALS WE CAN MAKE REAL OR VIRTUAL HUMANS IN A VIDEO GAME OUT OF THOSE CHEMICALS OUR ABILITY TO PERCEIVE ANYTHING IS DEPENDENT ONLY ON OUR CHEMICAL MAKEUP WHETHER ITS REAL OR VIRTUAL SO WE CAN RELIABLY PREDICT HOW OUR SIMULATED SELVES WOULD PERCEIVE OTHER SIMULATED OBJECTS ALSO JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE PERCEIVES SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY DOESNT MAKE IT ACTUALLY DIFFERENT AS THE VIDEO SEEMS TO IMPLY
JUST READ THIS AND OTHER ESSAYS BY CARNAP AND NEURATH FOR LAST SEMESTER'S PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE CLASS IT'S FUNNY HOW IF YOU READ THE HISTORY OF LOGICAL POSITIVISM BACKWARDS IT IS ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HATE EACH OTHER BUT EVENTUALLY COME TOGETHER AND AGREE ON MORE AND MORE THINGS UNTIL THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING
SOCRATES THERE IS A CERTAIN EXPERIENCE WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO AVOID

PHAEDO WHAT IS THAT

S THAT WE SHOULD NOT BECOME ISOLOGUES AS PEOPLE BECOME MISANTHROPES THERE IS NO GREATER EVIL ONE CAN SUFFER THAN TO HATE REASONABLE DISCOURSE MISOLOGY AND MISANTHROPY ARISE IN THE SAME WAY MISANTHROPY COMES WHEN A MAN WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OR SKILL HAS PLACED GREAT TRUST IN SOMEONE AND BELIEVES HIM TO BE ALTOGETHER TRUTHFUL SOUND AND TRUSTWORTHY THEN A SHORT TIME AFTERWARDS HE FINDS HIM TO BE WICKED AND UNRELIABLE AND THIS HAPPENS IN ANOTHER CASE WHEN ONE HAS FREQUENTLY HAD THAT EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE WHOM ONE BELIEVED TO BE ONE S CLOSEST FRIENDS THEN IN THE END AFTER MANY SUCH BLOWS ONE COMES TO HATE ALL MEN AND TO BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS SOUND IN ANY WAY AT ALL HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THIS HAPPEN

I SURELY HAVE

S THIS IS A SHAMEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS AND OBVIOUSLY DUE TO AN ATTEMPT TO HAVE HUMAN RELATIONS WITHOUT ANY SKILL IN HUMAN AFFAIRS FOR SUCH SKILL WOULD LEAD ONE TO BELIEVE WHAT IS IN FACT TRUE THAT THE VERY GOOD AND THE VERY WICKED ARE BOTH QUITE RARE AND THAT MOST MEN ARE BETWEEN THOSE EXTREMES THE SIMILARITY LIES IN THIS IT IS AS WHEN ONE WHO LACKS SKILL IN ARGUMENTS PUTS HIS TRUST IN AN ARGUMENT AS BEING TRUE THEN SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BELIEVES IT TO BE FALSE AS SOMETIMES IT IS AND SOMETIMES IT IS NOT AND SO WITH ANOTHER ARGUMENT AND THEN ANOTHER YOU KNOW HOW THOSE IN PARTICULAR WHO SPEND THEIR TIME STUDYING CONTRADICTION IN THE END BELIEVE THEMSELVES TO HAVE BECOME VERY WISE AND THAT THEY ALONE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE IS NO SOUNDNESS OR RELIABILITY IN ANY OBJECT OR IN ANY ARGUMENT BUT THAT ALL THAT EXISTS SIMPLY FLUCTUATES UP AND DOWN AS IF IT WERE IN THE EURIPUS AND DOES NOT REMAIN IN THE SAME PLACE FOR ANY TIME AT ALL

WHAT YOU SAY IS CERTAINLY TRUE

S IT WOULD BE PITIABLE PHAEDO WHEN THERE IS A TRUE AND RELIABLE ARGUMENT AND ONE THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IF A MAN WHO HAS DEALT WITH SUCH ARGUMENTS AS APPEAR AT ONE TIME TRUE AT ANOTHER TIME UNTRUE SHOAD NOT BLAME HIMSELF OR HIS OWN LACK OF SKILL BUT BECAUSE OF HIS DISTRESS IN THE END GLADLY SHIFT THE BLAME AWAY FROM HIMSELF TO THE ARGUMENTS AND SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE HATING AND REVILING REASONED DISCUSSION AND SO BE DEPRIVED OF TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF REALITY

YES BY ZEUS THAT WOULD BE PITIABLE INDEED

S THIS THEN IS THE FIRST THING WE SHOULD GUARD AGAINST WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW INTO OUR MINDS THE CONVICTION THAT ARGUMENTATION HAS NOTHING SOUND ABOUT IT MUCH RATHER WE SHOULD BELIEVE THAT IT IS WE WHO ARE NOT YET SOUND AND THAT WE MUST TAKE COURAGE AND BE EAGER TO ATTAIN SOUNDNESS YOU AND THE OTHERS FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR WHOLE LIFE STILL TO COME AND I FOR THE SAKE OF DEATH ITSELF
REMOVED
ONE PROBLEM IS THAT PHILOSOPHY JUST CLAIMS EVERYTHING FOR ITSELF IN THIS DAY AND AGE WE SHOULDN'T CALL POLITICS ETHICS RELIGION METAPHYSICS ETC PHILOSOPHY THERE ARE EXPERTS IN EACH FIELD AND PHILOSOPHY SEEMS TO HAVE MISSED THE SPECIALISATION AND PROFESSIONALISATION WHAT PARTLY FOLLOWS IS THAT WHILE TOPICS INCLUDED IN PHILOSOPHY SHOULD BE VERY MUCH CONCERNED WITH LOGIC THEY ARE TOO OFTEN NOT THE OVERALL RESULT IS THAT THE SPECIALISTS WHO DON'T CALL THEMSELVES PHILOSOPHERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHILE THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN THE TOPICS AS A PHILOSOPHER MAKE STUPID ERRORS IN THEIR OWN IDEAS AS WELL AS WHEN ANALYSING OTHERS WHAT'S LEFT WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THINGS LIKE POLITICS AND ETHICS IS A GROUP OF SUBJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY VERY INDIRECTLY AND MARGINALLY AND SHOULD BE SEEN AS AN ART FORM THAT'S A WAY IN WHICH THE TERM PHILOSOPHY COULD BE PRESERVED BUT IS ONLY A SUGGESTION OF MINE I THINK WE SHOULD GET RID OF THE OUTDATED CATEGORISATION WHICH IRONICALLY IS SOMETHING PHILOSOPHY SHOULD SEE
THE VALUE OF A FIELD ISN'T SO MUCH IN THE QUESTION IT POSES AND THE DEBATES IT CREATES BUT IN THE QUALITY OF THE ANSWERS IT PROVIDES AND THAT'S WHERE PHILOSOPHY FALLS RATHER SHORT
I THINK THE MAIN VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY IS LESS IN THE ANSWERS IT GIVES THAN IN THE PRACTICE IT PROVIDES IN FOCUSED ATTENTION AND THE MENTAL EXERCISE REQUIRED TO ANSWER DIFFICULT QUESTIONS
I THINK AS MANY HAVE PREVIOUSLY STATED THAT PHILOSOPHY IS A METHOD A METHOD THAT TEACHES YOU HOW TO THINK AND HOW NOT TO THINK WHICH IS AN IMMENSELY IMPORTANT THING
INTUITION CANNOT BE A SOURCE OF EVIDENCE FOR ACCEPTING OR REJECTING A PHILOSOPHICAL CLAIM IF INTUITIONS HAVE ANY ROLE IN PHILOSOPHY AT ALL I THINK WITTGENSTEIN SAID IT BEST WHEN HE SAID THAT INTUITIONS ARE THE RAW MATERIALS FOR PHILOSOPHY THEN WE WORK ON THOSE INTUITIONS WITH A SYSTEMATIC METHOD IF THE METHOD LEADS US TO UNINTUITIVE TRUTHS THEN SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THE INTUITIONS INTUITIONS ARE A SORT OF COME UP IN OUR EXPERIENCE WHETHER WE MEANT FOR THEM TO OR NOT THESE ARE IN NEED OF PHILOSOPHICAL TREATMENT THEY DON'T SERVE AS EVIDENCE OF CLAIMS TAKING THEM AT FACE VALUE IS JUST WHAT PEOPLE DO IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES IT IS NOT PART OF PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY WHICH IS MEANT TO QUESTION THE FACE VALUE OF THINGS

PHILOSOPHY NEEDS MORE WORK ON METHODOLOGY NOT MORE CLASS WHITE PEOPLE WHO HAPPENED TO DECIDE ON STUDYING PHILOSOPHY IN UNIVERSITY REPORTING THEIR INTUITIONS IN OBSCURE ACADEMIC JOURNALS
HOW COULD INTUITION BE DISREGARDED WHERE DO YOU THINK LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE SCIENTIFIC IDEA COMES FROM

YOU CAN ONLY DO ANY REAL SCIENCE IF YOU HAVE THE INTUITION THAT IT MIGHT BE TRUE YOU CAN'T GO ABOUT DOING RESEARCH FOR SOMETHING YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT YOU NEED TO HAVE THE INTUITION FOR HOW IT WOULD WORK

EINSTEIN DIDN'T JUST DO SOME RANDOM MATHEMATICS HE HAD THE INTUITION FOR HOW THE WORLD WORKS AND CONFIRMED HIS INTUITION WITH MATHEMATICS TESLA DIDN'T METHODICALLY DO A LOT OF RESEARCH ABOUT HOW ELECTRICITY WOULD WORK MOST OF HIS WORKS WERE BASED ON SIMPLE INTUITIONS ON HOW IT WOULD ALREADY WORK

WITHOUT INTUITION YOU'RE NOT A SCIENTIST YOU ARE ONLY A BOOK WORM WHO ONLY KNOWS HOW TO ABSORB TEXT BOOKS AND REPEAT EXPERIMENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN INTUITION IS THE CREATIVE ASPECT OF INVENTION
SUMMARY
IN THIS WIRELESS PHILOSOPHY VIDEO CASPAR HARE MIT ASKS CAN SCIENCE TELL US EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT THE WORLD HE TELLS US ABOUT A FAMOUS ARGUMENT THAT IT CAN'T SOMETIMES CALLED THE KNOWLEDGE ARGUMENT OR THE MARY ARGUMENT DUE TO PHILOSOPHER FRANK JACKSON IF THE ARGUMENT IS RIGHT THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE WORLD THAT WE CAN'T LEARN ABOUT THROUGH SCIENCE IN PARTICULAR WE CAN'T USE SCIENCE TO LEARN WHAT IT IS LIKE TO SEE RED OR TASTE COFFEE OR HAVE OTHER EXPERIENCES

THE LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE CANNOT INDEED DESCRIBE EVERYTHING BUT I WOULD ARGUE NO LANGUAGE CAN DESCRIBE EVERYTHING THE EXAMPLES OF SUCH THINGS FROM THE VIDEO ARE THE SENSATION OF THE COLOR RED AND AND THE TASTE SENSATION OF COFFEE THESE TYPE OF SENSATIONS ARE GENERALLY LABELED AS QUALIA BEFORE THE RED APPLE IS VIEWED OR THE COFFEE IS TASTED THE PERSON DOES NOT HAVE THESE QUALIA AND AFTERWARDS THEY DO

SO THE QUESTION ARISES WHERE DID THESE NEW QUALIA WHICH ARE KNOWN IN THE MIND COME FROM THE MATERIALIST COULD SAY THAT NEW SENSORY INPUT IS TRANSMITTED TO THE BRAIN FROM THE SENSE ORGANS CAUSING THE NEURONS TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE NOW HAS THESE QUALIA EAST G REDNESS AND COFFEE THE VIDEO SAYS THESE QUALIA TYPE OF SENSATIONS ARE

SO MY CONCLUSION FROM THE VIDEO IS THAT THE MIND BRAIN CAN TAKE PHYSICAL SENSE INPUT AND CREATE QUALIA BUT THE NATURE OF THESE QUALIA IN AND OF THEMSELVES CANNOT BE DESCRIBED USING LANGUAGE I CANNOT CREATE QUALIA IN SOMEONE MIND WITH ONLY WORDS INSTEAD I MUST PRESENT THEM SOMETHING PHYSICAL AND LET THEIR SENSE ORGANS AND BRAIN DO THE CREATIVE WORK OR PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE PERFORM SURGERY AND REARRANGE THEIR NEURONS DIRECTLY

THE OVERALL ARGUMENT IS A BIT CONFUSING THE FIRST PART EXPLAINS WHAT IS A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION THERE'S NOTHING MISSING IN THE DESCRIPTION AND THE QUESTION IS CAN WE PROVIDE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT'S IN A BOX BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW THE SECOND PART OF THE VIDEO WITH THE APPLE AND COFFEE ANSWER THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION
IT SEEMS LIKE A STRAW MANUAL DOES ANYONE ARGUE THAT SCIENCE CAN TEACH US EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT REALITY AT ANY POINT IN TIME THINGS HAVE HAPPENED THAT ARE SO FAR AWAY THAT LIGHT AND INFORMATION HASN'T REACHED US YET SO THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THINGS BEYOND THAT HORIZON WE WILL NEVER BE OMNISCIENT THAT'S LESS A LIMIT OF SCIENCE IN PARTICULAR AND MORE A BARE STATEMENT THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THINGS WE DON'T KNOW

THERE ARE ASPECTS OF REALITY THAT CANNOT BE DESCRIBED IN THE LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE

WHAT BASIS DO WE HAVE FOR MAKING THESE SPECIFIC CLAIMS ABOUT REALITY SUCH AS ANGELS WHILE IT IS UNCONTESTED THAT THERE ARE THINGS BEYOND OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING HERE WE HAVE CLAIMS BEING MADE ABOUT ANGELS AND WHATNOT THE ISSUE ISN'T MERELY THAT THESE ARE BEYOND SCIENCE RATHER THEY ARE UNSUPPORTED BY ANY EVIDENCE SURE AGAIN THERE ARE THINGS THAT EXIST OUT THERE THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT WE ARE NOT OMNISCIENT BUT THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT ANY SPECIFIC CLAIMS MADE ABOUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY OUT THERE

IT'S SPURIOUS TO FAULT SCIENCE IN PARTICULAR FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EXHAUST ALL POSSIBLE QUESTIONS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF OMNISCIENCE SEEMS AN INESCAPABLE EPISTEMIC REALITY NOT A LIMITATION OF SCIENCE SPECIFICALLY I AGREE THAT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORLD CANNOT BE COMPLETE WE CAN NEVER KNOW EVERYTHING THERE WILL ALWAYS BE QUESTIONS BUT THIS VIDEO SEEMS TO VEER AWAY FROM THAT EPISTEMOLOGICAL PROBLEM INTO CRITICISM OF SCIENCE SPECIFICALLY

THE QUESTIONS SCIENCE IS HERE BEING FAULTED FOR NOT ANSWERING SUCH AS THAT OF QUALIA HAVEN'T BEEN ANSWERED BY ANY OTHER APPROACHES EITHER WE CAN'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A BAT OR TO SEE MAGNETIC FIELDS OR TO HAVE ANY OTHER SENSES THAT WE DON'T HAVE THERE ARE THINGS WE DON'T KNOW AND PROBABLY THINGS WE'LL NEVER KNOW IS THAT A FAULT OF SCIENCE IN PARTICULAR OR JUST A BRUTE STATEMENT ABOUT US NOT KNOWING EVERYTHING

CONCLUSION ANY DESCRIPTION OF THE WORLD THAT'S DONE PURELY IN THE LANGUAGE OF NATURAL SCIENCE IS GOING TO BE INCOMPLETE

I'D SAY ANY DESCRIPTION OF THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE INCOMPLETE FULL STOP I AGREE WITH THIS EPISTEMIC ASSESSMENT I JUST OBJECT TO SCIENCE BEING FAULTED SPECIFICALLY FOR AN EPISTEMICALLY INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM
OUT OF CURIOSITY HOW DO WE KNOW IF THE TOMATO ONE PERSON SEES IS REPRESENTED IN AN IDENTICAL WAVELENGTH TO THE ANOTHER PERSON HOW DO WE KNOW IF MARY SEES RED BUT THE GRAY SCIENTISTS SEE THE COLOR AS BLUE
