LOOK

AT THAT

ART



TYPICAL INTERVIEW WITH SINGER ROK

IF THAT WHOLE THING HURT YOUR BRAIN WATCHING THEN IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO START FOR AUSTRALIA FINEST AND MOST CHAOTIC GROUP OF WAR MISERS SADISTIC EXECUTION WHO IS A BAND WHICH BORDERS ON DEATH BLACK INSANITY AND ACCORDING TO THE MEMBERS TOTAL SHIT DO NOT EVEN TRY TO GAUGE YOUR INTEREST IN THIS BAND BASED ON THIS ONE ALBUM AS THE BAND SAYS ITS SHIT IN INTERVIEWS AND THE PROMINENT GUITARWORK IS FROM A MEMBER WHO LEFT AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE RECORD APPROACHING THIS BAND IS LIKE GETTING CLOSER TO A CRAZY OLD PERSONS HOUSE WITH THE EXCITEMENT OF KNOWING HE COULD COME OUT THAT DOOR WITH A SHOTGUN AT ANY MOMENT

SADISTIC EXECUTION IS MANY THINGS BUT FOCUSED THEY ARE NOT IF WE WERE LOOKING OBJECTIVELY AT THIS RECORD THE MAGUS EMBODIES EXTREME METAL SCENE AS AN AVATAR OF CHAOS SIMILAR TO THE FURY AND SPEED OF FALLEN ANGEL OF DOOM BUT GIVEN MUCH MORE BEER AND SENT SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER IN THE STUDIO EVEN THE SECOND ALBUM WE ARE DEATH FUCK YOU IS LEAGUES AHEAD OF THE DEBUT IN TERMS OF FOCUS WHILE IT WOULD BE MORE LOGICAL TO GO WITH AN ALBUM THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD THERE IS SOMETHING MORE FUN ABOUT CHOOSING CHAOS AND I THINK SADISTIC EXECUTION WOULD WANT IT THAT WAY

WHY ARE YOU LISTENING TO THIS TODAY WELL YOU ARE NOT IF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD THE ALBUMS STILLBIRTH MACHINE OR FALLEN ANGEL OF DOOM OR VENGEANCE WAR TILL DEATH YOU ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO THOSE FIRST BEFORE JUMPING INTO THE MAGUS THIS ALBUM OF THE WEEK IS FOR A MORE DISCERNING AUDIENCE THAT IS BEST ENJOYED IN A SNIFTER WITH TO INHALE THE AROMA OF GASOLINE WHILE ENJOYING A FINE CIGAR WRAPPED IN NEWSPAPER

FUCK YES
EXTREME KOOL LETTER HAVE NEVER BEEN COOLER
SPELLING JOKES ASIDE THIS IS A FUCKING MADHOUSE OF AN ALBUM I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT
ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SUMMED UP THE AUSTRALIAN SCENE PRETTY WELL MARTIRE OTHERS ARE CHASING AFTER THIS ALBUM CATCHING UP NICELY BUT STILL CHASING
SOUND HAS REALLY CHANGED SINCE
U GREATTHUNDEROWL FELT BAD ABOUT USING SEPULTURAL FOR THE R DEATHMETAL AOW BECAUSE YOU GUYS DID IT FIRST NOW THE TABLES ARE FUKIEN TURNED CANTS
U AVELUCIFER HERE'S A LATE BIRTHDAY PRESENT FROM THE MODS
SO FUCKING GOOD
YEAR OLD ME FUCKING FELL IN LOVE WITH THESE GUYS AS SOON AS HE HEARD THE TRACK FUCKING DEATH I MEAN WHAT KIND OF KID DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR A TRACK OPEN WITH FUCK YOU FUCKING CUNT

THAT BEING SAID THE MAGUS IS MOST LIKELY THEIR MOST CONSISTENT ALBUM AS FAR AS MEMORY SERVES I'LL HAVE TO REVISIT THIS ONE TODAY IT'S BEEN TOO LONG
THIS HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY PONTIFY COLLECTION FOR AWHILE AND HASN'T BEEN TOUCH I'LL USE THIS AS A REASON TO GIVE IT A SHOT NOW
WHAT WAS THE PAST WEEK ALBUM
KLASSIKK RECORD TOTAL DEATH INSANITY THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
IT WAS GOOD ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT OF CALAHAN BROOD COVERING SUMMONING WHICH IS BASICALLY JUST SUMMONING WITH MORE DEPTH IN PRODUCTION
MY HEART JUST FUCKING STOPPED CALAHAN BROOD IS MY FAVORITE BAND

I HEARD TALKS OF COLLABORATIONS BUT I THOUGHT CALAHAN BROOD WAS DEAD I HOPE THIS MEANS A NEW ALBUM IN THE FUTURE
CAN'T LISTEN TO THIS YET AS I'M ON TRANSIT BUT HOLY HELL I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THAT CHORUS WITH THE CALAHAN BROOD CLEANS

EDIT NOT AS GOOD AS I WAS HOPING I WAS WANTING SOME DEEP BOOMING CHOIRS LIKE ON BOF BUT STILL GOOD IT REALLY IS JUST AS EVERYONE HAS SAID CLEANER PRODUCED SUMMONING
IT'S GREAT JUST LIKE THEIR OTHER SUMMONING COVERS










NEW ALBUM WHEN
OH MAN I HOPE THIS MEANS THERE'S A NEW CALAHAN BROOD ALBUM ON THE HORIZON I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IT WITH BATED BREATH SINCE ECHOES OF BATTLE CAME OUT
I THOUGHT THIS BAND WASN'T ACTIVE ANY MORE ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY'RE OFF OF PONTIFY THERE'S A LOT MORE MALAYAN TO BROOD ABOUT NOW THOUGH SO GLAD TO SEE THEY MIGHT BE BACK IN ACTION
FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T REALIZED IT'S ACTUALLY A COLLECTION OF SUMMONING COVERS BY OTHER ATMOSPHERIC BLACK METAL BANDS
ANTAEUS CONDEMNATION

SOME THINGS I THINK MAY HAVE INSPIRED ANTAEUS NEW ALBUM WOOD CHIPPERS ROOT CANALS INTERNET THE FEELING OF SITTING DOWN ON A COLD TOILET SEAT THIS SHIT IS PAINFUL AND UNPLEASANT IN A GOOD WAY THOUGH UNLIKE ALL THE TRIBULATIONS I JUST MENTIONED THE ALBUM ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THE BAND SAT DOWN AND SAID HOW AGGRESSIVE CAN WE MAKE THIS ALBUM AND STILL HAVE PEOPLE WANT TO LISTEN TO IT THE ALBUM TYPIFIES AGGRESSIVE BLACK METAL JAGGED SANDPAPER RIFFS SWARM AROUND OPPRESSIVE AND MILITARISTIC DRUMS VOCALS ARE SUNG HALFWAY BETWEEN A GROWL AND A SHRIEK BASS WELL IT PRETTY MUCH MATCHES THE GUITAR RIFFS AND THE RIFFS ARE EXCELLENT DESPITE THEIR DISSONANCE AND CHAOS THE RIFFS ARE QUITE CATCHY AND MEMORABLE THE DRUMS ARE QUITE IDIOSYNCRATIC THERE IS AN ALMOST QUALITY OF FORCE AND VIOLENCE TO THEM THE SNARE DRUM SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE IS HITTING IT WITH A JACKHAMMER WHEN BLASTS BEGIN AND THE BLASTS ARE VERY INTERESTING THE DRUMMER IS NOT CONTENT TO PERPETUATE STANDARD BLASTS INSTEAD CHOOSING TO SWITCH UP HIS PERCUSSIVE PLAYING IN A WAY THAT CONSTANTLY KEPT ME ON MY TOES AND STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP I FIND MYSELF IMAGINING WHAT THESE MUSICIANS MUST HAVE LOOKED LIKE AFTER RECORDING A SONG BLEEDING FINGERS SHREDDED VOCAL CHORDS I DON T EVEN WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF SHAPE THE DRUMMER MUST HAVE BEEN IN AFTER A PERFORMANCE LIKE THIS IF AND KINETIC BLACK METAL IS WHAT YOU SEEK LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THIS ATROCITY

MANILLA ROAD CRYSTAL LOGIC

AM I EVER GLAD I DECIDED TO DIVE INTO STRAIGHT UP HEAVY METAL I M NOT EVEN SURE HOW TO LAUD THIS ALBUM PROPERLY IT IS SO GOOD THERE IS NOT ONE SECOND OF WASTED SPACE ON THE ALBUM IT IS LEGIT EVERY INSTRUMENTAL PERFORMANCE ON THE ALBUM IS GREAT BUT THE CLEAR ALL-STAR OF THESE PROCEEDINGS IS MR MARK SHELTON THIS GUY IS AN ANIMAL HIS RIFFS ARE ALL BONE SHATTERINGLY POWERFUL AND AS PROPULSIVE AS A BULLET TRAIN THOUGH IN HIS LEADS HE TENDS TO SHRED TO HIS HEART S CONTENT HE POSSESSES THE MASTERFUL AND ENVIABLE SKILL OF TASTEFUL SHREDDING IT NEVER FEELS LIKE HE IS SHOWING OFF JUST TO SHOW OFF EVEN IN MOMENTS WHERE HE GOES MANIC LIKE THE INTRO TO FLAMING METAL SYSTEMS WHICH APPARENTLY IS NOT ON ALL VERSIONS OF THIS ALBUM OR THE RAM THEN THERE ARE HIS VOCALS IN GENERAL HE MAINTAINS A CONVERSATIONAL AND NASAL LILT THAT MAKES ME THINK OF A WIZENED OLD PROFESSOR OR A WIZARD BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER TIMES LIKE THIS WHERE HIS VOCALS SHATTER THE FUCKING FIRMAMENT HE DISPLAYS A LIQUID MERCURIAL VOCAL PERFORMANCE THAT IS TRULY AWE INSPIRING THOUGH I VE EXTOLED SHELTON UP TO THIS POINT THE OTHER PLAYERS ARE NO SLOUCHES THE DRUMMING IS GROOVY SOLID AND PUNCHY THE BASS IS GENERALLY PRETTY GREAT THROUGHOUT THE ALBUM TOO MOST OF THE TIME IT IS A SUBTLE PRESENCE WORKING ITS WAY AROUND THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS UNTIL THE ENDING SOLO SECTION OF DREAMS OF ESCHEATOR WHEN THE BASS LAYS DOWN ONE OF THE GREAT BASELINES I VE EVER HEARD I M SHOCKED AND APPALLED THAT I NEVER LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM BUT OH SO HAPPY I HAVE NOW

FOLIO COUNTY D NOUN TORMENTOR

TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL BLASTING LINE A THRASH THAT SLOWED DOWN QUITE A BIT BY THE TIME THEY FINALLY PUT OUT A ALTHOUGH THERE'S ONE TOTAL RIPPER ON IT AND YOU CAN PROBABLY GUESS WHICH SONG IS LINKED BELOW A COUPLE OF ARCHIVAL RELEASES ARE ON THE HORIZON ALTHOUGH ONE OF THOSE PUTS IN THE TITLE AND SESSIONS IN IN THE DESCRIPTION SO

DISCIPLE AXE OF THE PRIEST FROM DEMONIC DEMO

ETERNAL GRAVE FROM FOLIO COUNTY D NOUN
LADY KILLER LADY KILLER THIS IS SOME FAST AND ENERGETIC HEAVY METAL AND EVEN THOUGH IT HAS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE REQUISITE PARTS FOR A SOLID ALBUM IT CAME ACROSS TO ME AS JUST KIND OF GENERIC IT'S LOUD AND BLUSTERY FULL OF INVENTIVE RIFFS AND HAS PLENTY OF DECENT TRACKS BUT THERE JUST WASN'T A WHOLE LOT MEMORABLE TO IT AS FAR AS I COULD TELL AND BASED ON HOW WELL RECEIVED THIS ALBUM IS AT LEAST BASED ON YOUTUBE RATINGS I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE LIKED THIS ALBUM BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON IT JUST DIDN'T STICK CHECK OUT WASTE NO TIME FOR A SAMPLE OF WHAT THEIR SOUND IS LIKE IF YOU CAN DIG THIS TRACK YOU'LL PROBABLY LIKE THE REST

LORD BIG CITY LIGHTS LORD ARE A RATHER PROLIFIC HUNGARIAN HEAVY METAL BAND THAT FORMED IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES BUT WOULDN'T RELEASE A FULL-LENGTH ALBUM TILL THIS ONE THIS IS SOME SUPER MELODIC STUFF DRENCHED IN KEYBOARDS AND FILLED WITH AN ENDLESS SUPPLY OF CRUNCHY RIFFS AND VOCAL HOOKS THERE IS A STRONG BOSTON INFLUENCE ON ONE TRACK IN PARTICULAR MESEDAL BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY CHARACTERISTIC OF MOST OF THE SONGS HERE THIS ENTIRE ALBUM IS LITERALLY MADE OF EARWORMS AND EVEN THOUGH THE PRODUCTION IS SQUEAKY CLEAN AND OVERLY POPPY IN PLACES I CAN'T SHAKE HOW ENJOYABLE THE COMPOSITIONS ARE I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO HUNGARIAN METAL THERE IS LOTS OF BETTER STUFF OUT THERE BUT THAT DOESN'T KNOCK THIS AT ALL ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE HARD ROCK HEAVY METAL HYBRIDS LIKE I DO I CAN'T IMAGINE A LOT OF YOU LIKING THIS BUT I DON'T CARE BECAUSE THIS IS A GREAT FIND FOR ME I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING INTO THEIR LATER STUFF

LYNX CAUGHT IN THE TRAP HERE IS SOME INSANELY FAT HEAVY METAL FROM SWEDEN I HAD HEARD THIS BAND BEFORE BUT NEVER PLAYED THROUGH AN ENTIRE ALBUM THIS IS SUPER SWEET HEAVY METAL AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS TAILOR-MADE JUST FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME JUST ABOUT EVERY SONG HAS THOSE SLOW PUNCHY RIFFS THAT I LOVE INTERLACED WITH COMPETENT YET UNASSUMING VOCALS NOT ALL SONGS FIT INTO THAT PARTICULAR FRAMEWORK BUT EVEN THE ONES THAT DON'T ARE STILL EXCEEDINGLY STRONG LEAVING THE ALBUM COMPLETELY DEVOID OF FILLER IN ANY SENSE IT'S RARE THAT I COME ACROSS AN ALBUM THIS STRONG SO THIS IS DEFINITELY MAKING IT INTO MY REGULAR ROTATION IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO TELL BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THIS ONE ENDED UP AS ONE OF THOSE ENDURING CLASSICS THAT I SPIN FOR YEARS TO COME

LAZY CREATURE ANOTHER SWEDISH BAND WITH THE SAME KNACK FOR THOSE INFECTIOUS RIFFS THAT I GO CHASING AFTER THE PRODUCTION IS GOOD OVERALL BUT IT ACTUALLY DOES SUFFER FROM BEING TOO IN PLACES THE BASS IS REALLY TOO UNDERSTATED IN THE MIX AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE HEAVY AND BOMBASTIC NATURE OF THEIR RIFFS WOULD REALLY DO WELL FOR A MAKEOVER BUT EVEN WITH THAT COMPLAINT THE TOTAL PACKAGE HERE IS SO GOOD THAT I FEEL LIKE I'M NITPICKING THE RAW DELIVERY JUST HAPPENS TO WORK AMAZINGLY WELL FOR ALL THOSE SLOW AND PUNCHY RIFFS ANOTHER INCREDIBLE FIND RIGHT HERE



WOW AFTER A DISMAL SET OF K ALBUMS LAST TIME I HAVE THE EXACT OPPOSITE PROBLEM THIS TIME I ACTUALLY CAN'T PICK A WINNER HERE I HAVE NO PROBLEM LABELLING LADY KILLER AS THE CLEAR LOSER THOUGH TO SUM UP IF YOU LIKE HEAVY METAL YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD AND LOOK INTO BOTH OF THE SWEDISH ALBUMS BOTH ARE EQUALLY STRONG AND QUITE SIMILAR IN APPROACH THESE ARE STRONG CONTENDERS FOR MY VINYL COLLECTION IF THEY HOLD UP OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR SO IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND ALSO LIKE HEAVY METAL HARD ROCK DEFINITELY CHECK OUT LORD'S DEBUT AND IF YOU LIKE THAT I UNDERSTAND FROM OTHERS THAT THE NEXT FEW ALBUMS ARE ALSO QUITE GOOD
SO SINCE I GOT BACK FROM HOLIDAYS I'VE BEEN SERIOUSLY TIGHTENING UP MY DIET AND INCREASING MY RUNNING TO TIMES A WEEK IN THE LEAD UP TO SUMMER DOWN UNDAM AS A RESULT LAST WEEK I ACTUALLY KINDA CRASHED IN A PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL LOW POINT AND I TOTALLY DIDN'T FIGURE OUT IT WAS FROM CALORIE DEFICIT UNTIL LATELY

ANYWAY POINT BEING IS I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME GOING THROUGH SOME EMOTIONAL SHIT SO I TRIED RO COMPENSATE BY LISTENING TO A LOT OF UPBEAT FUN MUSIC OF COURSE THAT EXISTS IN METAL BUT THIS FORTNIGHT MY WHYBLT IS PRETTY SKEWED AWAY

RETRO WAVE

THE SYNTH WORSHIP I'VE BEEN JAMMING A LOT OF VHS GLITCH THEIR ALBUM EVIL TECHNOLOGY IS FUN AND HIGH ENERGY WHILST HALLOWEEN STRANGERS IS MORE DARK AND SPOOKY LIKE A JOHN CARPENTER FILM

SPEAKING OF THE LEGEND THERE IS A NW TRIBUTE ALBUM TO JOHN CARPENTER THEME MUSIC WHICH IS AMAZING AND THE NW BANDCAMP HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF COMPILATIONS FOR FREE PURCHASE TO GIVE AN IDEA OF NEW ARTISTS

DENOVOMUTANS IS ANOTHER ARTIST FITTING NEATLY INTO THE TERMINATOR URBAN CYBER SYNTH STYLE LOVE IT

BJORN LANDE AND RUSSELL ALLEN

BJORN WAS ALWAYS MY FAVOURITE CONTRIBUTOR TO AVANTASIA ALBUMS WITH THE SEXIEST VOICE IN METAL THESE ALBUMS DONT QUITE PACK THE SAME PUNCH AS AVANTASIA BUT AS A MASSIVE SYMPHONY X FAN AS WELL I ADORE HEARING THESE TWO CROON OVER ALBUMS OF MUSIC

EASY CORE

BEFORE I'M ESCORTED OUT OF THE HALL I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE BIGGEST EASIEST WAY TO RESTORE BOTH MY ENERGY LEVELS AND A GRIN IS BY PLAYING SOME WITH AN EXTRA HEAVY BOUNCE TO IT I WILL NOTE THAT I TEND TO HATE ANYTHING THAT VEERS TO CLOSE TO THINKING IT'S METAL ASKING ALEXANDRIA OF MICE AND MEN AND LIKE MY AND METAL LIKE CHOCOLATE AND PEANUT BUTTER FUCKING ENTIRELY SEPARATE

A DAY TO REMEMBER HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BANDS AND I'M DIGGING THEIR NEW ALBUM FOUR YEAR STRONG RETURNED WITH A CATCHY ONE LAST YEAR BUT I ALSO DISCOVERED RECENTLY CHUNK NO CAPTAIN CHUNK AND NECK DEEP THE LATTER OF WHOM HAS THE MOST FUCKING CATCHY SONG EVER WRITTEN ABOUT INDIANA JONES KALI MA

METALL ICA

SEEING THEM FUCKING REFERENCED ON EVERY METALSUCKS OR METAL HAMMER ARTICLE I DECIDED TO REVISIT THEIR OLD ALBUMS I ALWAYS LOVED RIDE THE LIGHTNING BUT I STILL FEEL MOST OF THEIR OTHER ALBUMS ARE NOTHING SPECIAL EVEN IF MOST TEND TO HAVE A FEW KILLER TRACKS AMONGST THE FILLER

HOWEVER I LISTENED TO ST ANGER FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I REALLY LIKE IT I LISTEN TO A LOT OF SLAM AND BRUTAL DEATH SO THE SNARE DRUM SOUND WAS FINE TO ME THE PRODUCTION WAS VERY MUDDY MESSY AND LOUD BUT I VASTLY PREFER THAT TO THE RATHER STERILE AND NEATLY EXECUTED HARDWIRED PRODUCTION JAMES VOCALS ARE A LOT MORE UNPOLISHED HE LOSES TONE CRACKS HIS VOICE AND I LOVE IT AS OPPOSED TO HARDWIRED WHERE THE ONLY TIME I FEEL ANYTHING IS IN SPIT OUT THE BONE THERE'S OBVIOUS MUMETAL GROOVES IN SOME SONGS BUT CONSIDERING THE TIME IT CAME OUT IN I THOUGHT IT WAS A FANTASTIC ALBUM PROBABLY MY SECOND FAVOURITE METALLICA AFTER RTL
METAL


NECROMORBID EL DA DE LA BASTIA ITALY BLACKENED DEATH METAL

MY GOODNESS DOES THIS ALBUM RULE AND LOOK AT THAT FUCKING ALBUM COVER A GOAT WITH A SWORD NOTRE DAME AND NASTY SPEAR WIELDING DEMONS PHEW BE STILL MY BEATING HEART AND THE MUSIC IMAGINE AN UNRELENTING BLACKENED DEATH METAL ASSAULT NOT UNLIKE ARCHGOAT AND BLACK WITCHERY NECROMORBID LEAN SLIGHTLY MORE ON THE BLACK SIDE OF THE FENCE TAKING A BOOK OUT OF MARDUK S MILITARISTIC SNARE TACTICS IT IS STILL DEATH METAL THOUGH CHUNKY RIFFS POP UP NOW AND AGAIN TO BREAK THE ASSAULT GIVEN THE TRACK RECORD OF THIS GENRE YOU MIGHT EXPECT A LESS REFINED PRODUCTION STYLE NOT SO HERE EVERYTHING IS CRISP AND CLEAR YET SATISFYINGLY WARM ENOUGH TO SHAKE THE FEAR OF NUCLEAR BLASTISMS

FOR ME THIS MIGHT BE TOP TEN MATERIAL IT IS A SHORT PUNCHY ALBUM THAT LENDS ITSELF TO WHOLE LISTENS MAYBE BECAUSE THE DOWNLOAD IS TWO LONG SONGS AKIN TO A TAPE RIP ALTHOUGH NOTHING NEW IT IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY WELL CRAFTED TAKE ON THE GENRE THAT PULLS NO PUNCHES I FIND MYSELF CONTINUALLY RETURNING FOR MORE EVEN IF THEY SING ABOUT SATAN TOO MUCH


ANTAEUS CONDEMNATION FRANCE BLACK METAL


SOMEONE LIKES PLAYING SNARE DRUMS VERY FAST

I LL ADMIT THAT ON FIRST LISTEN THIS ALBUM WAS A REAL STRUGGLE HAVING NO EXPERIENCE WITH THIS BAND BEYOND HEARING THE NAME A FEW TIMES AND OF THEIR FEARSOME REPUTATION IT FELT LIKE CHARGING IN TO BATTLE WITH NOTHING BUT MY UNDIES THE ALBUM JUST DOES NOT LET UP TO DESCRIBE IT AS OPPRESSIVE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT IT IS INTENT ON BEATING YOU SENSELESS ON FRACTURING YOUR MIND IT IS TERRIFYING

ONCE YOU GET OVER THE FACT THAT THE DRUMMER IS BASICALLY A DEMON HIGH ON COKE THERE S A LOT TO TAKE IN THIS IS HATEFUL SPITEFUL MUSIC THAT IS TRULY UNCOMFORTABLE NOT UNLIKE SITTING ON A DRAWING PIN FOR PROLONGED PERIODS OF TIME NO YOU MAY NOT GO TO THE BATHROOM CLASS HAS JUST STARTED

THE OPENING TRACK SHADOW FIRES SETS THE TONE FOR THE THE ALBUM IT IS A HURRICANE OF BLAST BEATS AND CLASSIC BLACK METAL RIFFING WITH ROARING VOCALS THAT ARE PRESUMABLY SAYING SOMETHING VERY ANGRY I FEEL ANOTHER MARDUK COMPARISON COMING ON HERE THOUGH ANTAEUS ARE MORE INTENT ON SINISTER ATMOSPHERE THAN TANK WORSHIP SONGS LIKE THE TITLE TRACK AND END OF DAYS LEAN HEAVILY ON THE MAYHEM SCHOOL OF RIFFING THOUGH THERE S SOME ATONAL PASSAGES SIMILAR TO DEATHSPELL OMEGA THE OVERALL SOUND OF THE ALBUM IS CLOYING AND DENSE THOUGH NOT WITHOUT CLARITY THE INSTRUMENTS CAN BE HEARD CLEARLY AND EVEN THOUGH THE SNARE DRUM IS RELENTLESS IT NEVER FEELS PURPOSELESS


FOR FEAR OF FURTHER EMBARRASSMENT I LL STOP TRYING TO DESCRIBE WHAT MORE OR LESS EVERYONE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT BLACK METAL WHAT I WILL SAY THOUGH IS THIS DESPITE IT S OPPRESSIVE EXCLUSIONIST NATURE CONDEMNATION IS ULTIMATELY COMPELLING YOU MAY NOT GET IT AT FIRST BUT SIT WITH IT A FEW TIMES AND IT STARTS TO SINK IN WELL THAT OR YOUR HEAD EXPLODES


DEATHSTORM BLOOD BENEATH THE CRYPTS AUSTRIA THRASH HTTPS

I M LOATHE TO MAKE THE LINK TO A CERTAIN INANIMATE PUPPET PERCUSSIONIST BUT THIS BAND DEMAND IT JUST LISTEN TO THIS AND YOU LL SEE DEATHSTORM PLAY SNOTTY HYPERACTIVE THRASH IN THE VEIN OF EARLY SLAYER AND CREATOR THE RIFFS ARE INFECTIOUSLY HYPER THE DRUMMING IS UNHINGED AND SLOPPY THE VOCALS ARE FURIOUS BUT IT WORKS AND ACROSS THE EIGHT TRACKS PRESENTED ON THIS ALBUM THERE S NEVER A DULL MOMENT

THE SHEER ENTHUSIASM OF THIS BAND IS INTOXICATING LISTENING THROUGH YOU NOTICE MISTAKES AND TEMPO IRREGULARITIES AND OFF THE CUFF SOLOS BUT IT DOESN T MATTER DEATHSTORM TEAR ON THROUGH RAISING THE FINGER AT YOUR STUPID EXPECTATIONS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THRASH THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE IT S NAMESAKE DEATHSTORM HAVE YOUR BACK



A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT I VE NOT HAD AS MUCH TIME TO LISTEN TO


MORTEM DEINOS NEKROMANTIS PERU DEATH METAL

A WELCOME RETURN FROM THE PERUVIAN DEATH METAL MASTERS I VE ONLY HAD THE CHANCE TO LISTEN THROUGH A COUPLE OF TIMES BUT INITIAL IMPRESSIONS ARE POSITIVE THE OPENING TRACK ANGEL OF APOSTASY IS CLASSIC MORTEM THRASH OLD SCHOOL DEATH METAL THINK POSSESSED MEETS EARLY MORBID ANGEL


ATTACKER SINS OF THE WORLD US USP

TRULY EPIC USP FROM THE MASTERS EXPECT THE USUAL KILLER RIFFS SOARING VOCALS CATCHY CHORUSES SILLY INTROS


JACTIVUS RITES OF ASCENSION UK CAVERNOUS DEATH METAL

FFA CRUCIAMENTUM GRAVE MIASMA ETC WHILE NOT STARTLINGLY ORIGINAL JACTIVUS ARE STILL COMPELLING ENOUGH TO WARRANT LISTENING TO THEY MANAGE TO CAPTURE THAT DISTINCTLY BRITISH CAVERNOUS SOUND




NON-METAL


PETER GABRIEL SO UK POP WORLD

BECAUSE SLEDGEHAMMER IF YOU LIKE S ERA GENESIS BUT PREFERED THAT THEY STAYED ARTSIER THIS ALBUM S FOR YOU I MEAN IT HAS PANPIPES AND KATE BUSH

SEX PISTOLS NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS HERE S THE SEX PISTOLS UK PUNK

CLASSIC PUNK ROCK FEELS GOOD TO BLAST THIS NOW AND AGAIN

MASSIVE ATTACK MEZZANINE UK TRIP HOP

UNDENIABLY A CORNERSTONE OF THE GENRE GRANTED MOST OF IT IS HARD TO LISTEN TO BECAUSE OF IT S UBIQUITY BUT I BELIEVE THERE S AN OTHERWORLDLY EXPERIENCE TO HEARING ANGEL IN A DARK ROOM THROUGH HEADPHONES IT REMINDS ME OF LIVING IN BRISTOL UK OF HEARING BASS RESONATE THROUGH WALLS AT WITH THE SUN JUST RISING


NEXT MONTH IN POWER METAL DECEMBER PREVIEWS ONE AWESOME TRADITIONAL HEAVY METAL ONE DECENT POWER METAL BAND WITH COOL ARTWORK AND ONE BAND THAT IS DOING THE ELDER SCROLLS IN A CONCEPT ALBUM DON'T TELL U DOEDANZEE BECAUSE HE WILL COME IN AND TELL ME THAT GAME SUCKS AND ILL GET ANGRY AND GO MINE ORE TO MAKE WEAPONS SO I CAN TAKE OUT MY FRUSTRATIONS

METALLICA OH LOOK ANOTHER ASSHOLE ON THE INTERNET HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE NEW METALLICA ALBUM MAYBE I JUST WANT MOM AND DAD TO STOP FIGHTING AND US TO FINISH DINNER



MALTHEIST HOJU SHIT PORTLAND AND THE WEST COAST JUST CHILL ON HOW MANY BANDS YOU ARE PUTTING OUT CULTURALLY CHARGED DEATH GRIND THAT DOESN'T DATE THEMSELVES IMMEDIATELY AFTER PUTTING OUT A RECORD HARROWING VOCALS AND OBNOXIOUS GUITARS

A SOUTH M HOLY SHIT VIRGINIA BESTIAL BLACK DEATH THIS IS A REALLY FUN DEMO IF YOU WANT THE SOUND OF A CONCRETE BLOCK HITTING BONE



EVERYTHING ELSE THIS IS MY POPULAR MUSIC PLAYLIST I UPDATE THROUGHOUT EACH MONTH FOR MY WIFE AND I WHO WANT TO KEEP UP WITH WHAT THE KIDS ARE LISTENING TOO THIS MONTH HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY STABOY WHICH IS CATCHY AS HELL PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT IS A GRAND STEP IN TERMS OF STYLE BUT EVERYTHING SINCE THEIR MIXTAPES LIKE HOUSE OF BALLOONS AND THURSDAY HAVE BEEN MOVING TOWARDS THIS PLUS THEIR APPEARANCE ON EVERYTHING POPULAR FOR THE LAST YEARS WAS WORKING TO THIS POINT JUSTICE TRACK IS COOL DESPITE THE STUPID NAME IM TOO OLD TO LIKE SLEIGH BELLS AND CHAIN-SMOKER ARX SOUNDS LIKE GHOST WITHOUT THE OCCULT GARB BAYONNE IS AWESOME AND SOUNDS LIKE DEPARTMENT OF EAGLES SAD IS COOL AND THROWS BACK TO EARLY S ALT ROCK WITHOUT BEING A CARTOON EMPIRE OF THE SUN IS MGM I AM SURE OF IT A TRIBE CALLED QUEST I DO NOT REALLY GET CHILDISH GAMBINO AND FIND HIS CULT FOLLOWING SUSPICIOUS BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T LISTEN TO HIP HOP WRAP THEIR ARMS AROUND HIM
AELLA HOLD YOUR HORSE IS

THIS IS THE BAND THAT ZACH HILL WAS IN BEFORE DEATH GRIPS IT'S SOME REALLY GOOD MATH ROCK WITH THE GUITAR AND THE DRUMS GOING AT IT IN PERFECT SYNC REALLY GOOD STUFF

DEAD CONGREGATION GRAVES OF THE ARCHANGELS

IT'S FINALLY CLICKED AND I CAN FINALLY ENJOY DEAD CONGREGATION IN ALL ITS GLORY LISTENING TO THE WHOLE ALBUM IN ONE SITTING IS REALLY THE ONLY WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS I WILL STILL SAY THAT MARTYRDOM IS WAY TOO LONG BUT IT DOES DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF CREATING THIS VERY FOREBODING FEELING THAT LEADS INTO HOSTAS HUMAN GENERIS VERY WELL

TALES OF MEDUSA THE FATAL WOUNDING GAZE

TRAD IS SOMETHING I DON'T REALLY DELVE INTO UNLESS IT'S RECOMMENDED BY SOME OF THE REGULARS ON THIS SUB AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BANDS FANTASTIC RIFFS FANTASTIC PERFORMANCES SUCH A SHAME THAT THERE'LL NEVER BE ANY OR NEW MATERIAL


METALLICA HARDWIRED TO THIS ALBUM CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE I AM SO USED TO WRITING OFF METALLICA I HATED STREET ANGER AND DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO DEATH MAGNETIC UNTIL RECENTLY IT WAS DECENT DEFINITELY A BIT OF A RETURN TO FORM BUT DIDN'T REALLY MAKE A BIG IMPRESSION I HAVE TO ADMIT SOME OF THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM KICKED MY ASS OVERALL I'D SAY HALF OF IT IS FILLER AND HALF IS VERY GOOD METALLICA WITH INFLUENCES SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER LUCKILY NONE FROM STREET ANGER IMO IF THEY HAD MADE ALBUM WITH HARDWIRED ALTUS RISE NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD MOTH INTO FLAME HALO ON FIRE AND SPIT OUT THE BONE THEY'D HAVE HAD A KILLER ALBUM

FREEDOM CALL MASTER OF LIGHT THIS ALBUM WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME I REALLY LOVED THEIR LAST ALBUM BEYOND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST IN THEIR CAREER AND THOUGHT THEY'D BE ABLE TO CARRY THEIR SUCCESS FORWARD BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY A RETURN TO MORE STANDARD DECENT FREEDOM CALL GOOD ENOUGH FOR A FAN I DO ENJOY IT BUT NOT SOMETHING I'D RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE

EPIC THE HOLOGRAPHIC PRINCIPLE I KIND OF WROTE OFF THIS ALBUM AFTER GIVING IT A COUPLE LISTENS BUT DECIDED TO GIVE IT A CLOSER LOOK I'M GLAD I DID THERE'S SOME GOOD SONGS HERE I STILL NEED TO GIVE IT A FEW MORE LISTENS TO FIND THEM ALL BUT I'M DIGGING EDGE OF THE BLADE AND BEYOND THE MATRIX ITS A DOUBLE ALBUM SO A BIT MUCH TO TAKE IN

UNFATHOMABLE RUINATION FINITUDE I'M NOT SURE WHY I'VE BEEN GIVING THIS ALBUM SO MANY LISTENS I'M NOT BIG ON BRUTAL DEATH METAL BUT LIKED IT AND MY TASTES SORT OF USUALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS LINE UP THEIRS I ALSO JUST WANTED TO GIVE A DENSE DEATH METAL ALBUM A TRY SINCE IT'S BEEN A WHILE BUT AFTER ABOUT LISTENS I STILL JUST CAN'T GET INTO IT THERE ARE MOMENTS I ENJOY SOME GOOD RIFFS BUT OVERALL I CAN'T FIND A SINGLE SONG THAT STANDS OUT OR EVEN A SINGLE MELODY OR MOMENT THAT I CAN RECALL MAYBE WITH MORE LISTENS OR MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GIVE UP ON THIS KIND OF MUSIC BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT IDEA
SCORCHED ECHOES OF DISMEMBERMENT

FUCKING WOW DUDE ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING AND OUT OF LEFT FIELD DIDN'T EXPECT THIS AT ALL PURE AUTOPSY VASTUS WORSHIP SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S LIKE HAVING A FASTER 4TH VASTUS ALBUM HAHA PURE FUCKING CRUSHING RIFFS ALONG WITH FANTASTIC DRUMMING BY THE DUDE FROM HOUSEWRECKER FAVORITE SONG WOULD HAVE TO BE DEALINGS OF A GRUESOME KIND I MEAN IT'S LITERALLY A VASTUS SONG ALMOST GOD THIS ALBUM IS SO GOOD

ARCHAGATHUS CANADIAN HORSE

GOOFY BUT VERY VERY STRONG MINCECORE IN THE VEIN OF AGATHOCLES SOME PUNK ASS RIFFS ON HERE AS WELL AS UNIQUE VOCALS THAT YOU DON'T HEAR MUCH IN GRIND MINCE ALBUM COVER ALSO RULES

VOID MEDITATION CULT UTTER THE TONGUE OF THE DEAD

PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME KNOW I WON'T SHUT UP ABOUT THIS ALBUM AND FOR GOOD REASON IT'S THE BEST BLACK RELEASE OF THE YEAR ENHERIT DEMENCY WORSHIP TO THE MAX AND GOD IS IT FUCKING FILTHY NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE SOME OF THE MOST UNIQUE VOCALS IN THE GENRE REMINISCENT OF A MORE CAVERNOUS SOUNDING DAGON THERE'S GOD DAMN WHISPER VOX HAIL WHISPER VOX

NYOGTHAEBLISZ TERRORISTIC ONSLAUGHT OF HUMANICIDAL CHAOS

POSERS NEED NOT LISTEN ABSOLUTE SONIC ONSLAUGHT FROM THESE DUDES EVERY RELEASE IS BEYOND INSANE AND MOST PHYSICALLY HURT TO LISTEN TO ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE TAKES ON THE BLASPHEMY SOUND COMPLETELY WARPING IT AND MAKING IT THEIR OWN


GRAVE DIGGER KNIGHTS OF THE CROSS

GRAVE DIGGER IS ONE OF THOSE BANDS I'VE BEEN MEANING TO CHECK OUT SINCE I'VE HEARD THAT THEY'RE ONE OF THE ELUM BANDS FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THE BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM WOULD BE IT SOUNDS LIKE GLORY TO THE BRAVE WITH A RASPY VOCALIST SPEAKING OF VOCALS LIKE I SAID THEY'RE MAINLY IN THIS RASPY SINGING STYLE REMINISCENT OF RUNNING WILD AND ALONG WITH THAT THERE'S ALSO CHASE CLEAN MELODIC SINGALONG PARTS THAT KINDA FEEL FORCED BUT THEY DON'T RUIN THE ALBUM FOR ME THE RIFFING HERE IS ALSO GOOD NOT THE MOST AMAZING BUT GOOD AND HERE COMES MY MAIN ISSUE WITH KNIGHTS OF THE CROSS THERE ISN'T MUCH VARIETY WITH SOME SONGS FEELING LIKE FILLER


KATATONIA BRAVE MURDER DAY

AROUND WEEKS AGO I GAVE MY THOUGHTS ON DANCE OF DECEMBER SOULS WHICH I LOVED AFTER THAT I DIDN'T REALLY LISTEN TO ANY KATATONIA UNTIL THIS WAS FEATURED AS THE AOW LAST WEEK WHICH PROMPTED ME TO LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM AND I LOVE IT NOT SURE IF I PREFER THIS OR DECEMBER SOULS THOUGH

CULT OF LUNA JULIE CHRISTMAS MARINER

I USED TO BE REALLY INTO CULT OF LUNA IN AUTUMN LAST YEAR WELL THEIR FIRST THREE ALBUMS ANYWAY SINCE I NEVER GOT AROUND TO CHECKING THEM OUT BESIDES THOSE AFOREMENTIONED THREE ALBUMS BUT AROUND FEBRUARY THIS YEAR I LOST INTEREST IN THEM BUT I REGAINED SOME INTEREST IN THEM AROUND THE SAME TIME THIS ALBUM CAME OUT IN EARLY APRIL BUT I NEVER GOT AROUND TO CHECKING THIS ALBUM OUT UNTIL RECENTLY AND I FOUND THIS TO BE A GREAT ALBUM DEFINITELY GOING IN MY TOP ALBUMS OF THE YEAR
THE VOCALS HERE ARE WAY BETTER THAN ON ANY OTHER COL ALBUM WHILE THEIR USUAL SHOUTS ARE STILL HERE WHICH I FIND TO BE THE WEAKEST PART AS ALWAYS WITH CULT OF LUNA SINCE I THINK THEY'RE JUST OKAY IF NOT A BIT BORING BUT VOCALS HERE ARE AMAZING EASILY THE BEST PART OF THIS ALBUM AND THERE'S ALSO MALE CLEANS PROVIDED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE BAND WHICH ARE ALSO GREAT OTHER THAN THAT THE SONGWRITING IS GREAT SINCE THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEIR STRONG POINT

KRALLICE EGG HOUR

ONE OF THOSE BANDS SITTING PERPETUALLY ON THE PERIPHERAL OF MY LISTENING THAT I NEVER REALLY GOT ROUND TO PROPERLY HEARING DECIDED TO START HERE MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE WEIRD ARTWORK BUT FROM THE DESCRIPTIONS BRIEF ENCOUNTERS I'VE HAD WITH THE BAND BEFORE IT'S PROBABLY FAIR TO SAY THIS IS A FAIRLY GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THEIR SOUND IT'S A JARRING ANGULAR APPROACH TO BLACK METAL THAT IS FOREVER TWISTING AND FALLING ON ITSELF NO SURPRISES THAT IT BRINGS TO MIND GORGETS OCCASIONALLY CONSIDERING ROLE IN BOTH

URFAUST APPARITIONS

PICKED THIS UP ON WHIM BANDCAMP BINGE A RELEASE THAT REALLY SHOWS OFF THIS STRANGE BOOMY BLACK METAL BAND REALLY IMMERSES ITSELF IN THE MORE AMBIENT SIDE OF THINGS EVEN GOING SO FAR TO CLOSE UP WITH A MINUTE DARK AND BROODING AMBIENT TRACK THAT CAN BE REALLY QUITE OPPRESSIVE A REAL INTERESTING LISTEN WORTH IT ALONE FOR THE HAUNTING TITLE TRACK PERHAPS NOT AS IMMEDIATE AS THEIR ALBUM WORKS BUT STILL A WORTHWHILE LISTEN

SUMMONING MINAS MOGUL

WHILE I'VE NOT QUITE GOT THROUGH ALL SUMMONING HAS TO OFFER YET THIS HAS BEEN THE ALBUM OF THEIRS THAT I'VE ENJOYED THE MOST I'M NOT SURE WHAT ABOUT IT WAS DIFFERENT BUT IT SEEMED TO ME TO COME ACROSS AS MORE EPIC THAN THE OTHERS LUGBURZ AND DAGO BRAGOLLACH STAND OUT TO ME IN THIS REGARD

KING GOAT CONDUIT

FOR SOME REASON I'VE NEVER GOTTEN AROUND TO LISTENING TO MUCH DOOM METAL BUT THIS CAUGHT MY EYE FOR SOME REASON AND I JUST GAVE IT A SHOT REALLY GLAD I DID AS I FOUND MYSELF ENJOYING THE ALBUM A HELL OF A LOT NOTHING ABOUT IT WAS PARTICULARLY OUTSTANDING BUT EVERYTHING SEEMED VERY SOLID WITHOUT REALLY ANY WEAK POINTS

METALLICA HARDWIRED TO

WHILE I DIDN'T HAVE THE HIGHEST EXPECTATIONS THIS ALBUM CERTAINLY MANAGED TO EXCEED THEM I EXPECTED A MEDIOCRE ALBUM WITH A FEW STAND OUT TRACKS BUT GOT A VERY SOLID ALBUM THAT COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY BEEN FANTASTIC IF THEY WERE SLIGHTLY BETTER AT SELF EDITING REMOVING 2 OR SONGS OF THE SECOND DISK COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE ALBUM FROM DRAGGING AT THE END THE RIFFS WERE WELL WRITTEN THE DRUMMING WAS PASSABLE AND THE SINGING WAS FANTASTIC IT'S CERTAINLY NO MASTER OF PUPPETS BUT I WOULD BE FINE WITH A FEW MORE ALBUMS LIKE THIS

AGALLOCH THE MANTLE

I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IN MY TOP FAVORITE ALBUMS OF ALL TIME AND SEEMS TO FIT THE COLD SEASON I REALLY ENJOY THE DISTINCT FEEL OF MOST OF THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM AS WELL AS THE USE OF SOME INSTRUMENTS OR SOUNDS MADE WITH A KEYBOARD I'M NOT SURE WHICH THAT I WOULDN'T USUALLY EXPECT TO FIND IN METAL THAT HELP PREVENT ANY PARTS OF THE ALBUM BEING A DRAG THE HAWTHORNE PASSAGE AND IN THE SHADOW OF OUR PALE COMPANION ARE MY FAVORITE SONGS OF THE ALBUM

ON A SLIGHTLY LESS METAL NOTE I'VE FOUND MYSELF MANAGING TO GET INTO A FEW DUNGEON SYNTH ALBUMS WHICH WASN'T SOMETHING I WASN'T EXPECTING LORD LOVIDICUS BOOK OF LORE VOLUME FAVORITE TRACK AND CRANG WITHIN THE LAND OF MY IMAGINATION I AM THE ONLY GOD HAVE KEPT ME ENTRANCED WITHIN WHATEVER BOOK I HAPPEN TO BE READING AIDED ME GREATLY WITH PROCRASTINATING ABOUT MY PERSONAL STATEMENT
SABATON THE LION FROM THE NORTH

I'M A FAN OF HEAVY FAST GUITARS BUT MOST METAL IS AWESOME WHAT I PARTICULARLY LIKE ABOUT THIS SONG AND BAND IS THEY STICK TO EXPLAINING HISTORICAL EVENTS WHILE MAKING THEIR SONGS POWERFUL AGGRESSIVE AND REALLY GREAT CHORUSES

FOUND THE BAND THROUGH AN R VIDEOS POST OF A LIVE PERFORMANCE OF WAS HOOKED IMMEDIATELY

KHEMMIS HUNTED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ALBUM MAKES ME FEEL GOOD THE RIFFS ARE HUGE AND HEAVY AND NEVER FEEL CLICHED THE CLEAN VOCALS ARE THICK AND MEATY THE GROWLED VOCALS ARE USED FOR IMPACT WHEN THINGS GET ROUGH NOT JUST STREWN ABOUT AND UNTIL JUST NOW I BARELY NOTICED THE RHYTHM SECTION IT WAS JUST THERE SOMEWHERE DRIVING AHEAD IF SOMEONE HAD ASKED ME TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THOUGHT A GREAT ALBUM WAS I'M NOT SURE I COULD HAVE DESCRIBED THIS BUT THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES THIS YEAR EVEN MY WIFE LOVES THE ALBUM SO BONUS POINTS THERE FOR DIGESTIBILITY

VADER THE EMPIRE THIS IS REALLY GREAT DEATH THRASH THAT HAD ME FROM THE OPENING RIFF ONE THING I NOTICED IS THAT VADER DOESN'T INSIST ON A BREAKNECK PACE UNLIKE A LOT OF RECENT THRASH THAT I ENJOY THERE'S A COMFORTABLE MIX OF SPEED AND GROOVE THE GUITARS ARE THICK BUT CLEAR AND THE VOCALS HAVE A BARKED QUALITY THAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU ON TRACKS LIKE TO THE GOD OF WAR AND REIGN THEY MIX IN RASPY VOCALS TO GIVE SOME DEPTH AND A CREEPY VIBE SHORT TRACK LENGTHS A VARIETY OF RIFFS AND CONSISTENT QUALITY MAKES IT HARD TO TURN OFFICIAL ACTUALLY IF ANYONE READ THIS FAR I WOULDN'T MIND SOME EARLIER VADER RECOMMENDATIONS

DARK TRANQUILLITY ABOMA I'VE BEEN FINDING A LOT OF MELODEATH THAT I LIKE THIS YEAR CLEAN VOCALS ON TOP OF SCREAMED RASPED VOCALS ON TOP SYNTH ON TOP OF BUZZ SAW GUITAR ON TOP OF SYNTH ON TOP OF DRUMS WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS MOVING CONSTANTLY THE ALBUM OPENS WITH A GRANDIOSE FAST PACED SONG THAT DOES A GOOD JOB OF LETTING YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR BY THE TIME YOU GET TO MOMENTUM THE BAND IS A BIT MORE COMFORTABLE SLOWING DOWN AND LETTING YOU ENJOY THE SYNTH THE REST OF THE ALBUM BOUNCES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN FAST SOARING AND SLOW ATMOSPHERIC I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO SCREW UP PACING OR PUT IN COMPLEXITY WHERE YOU DON'T NEED IT AND THESE GUYS DID A GREAT JOB NEVER MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE THEY WERE PLAYING OUT OF PLACE OR TRYING TOO HARD

NOT METAL

THE BLACK QUEEN FEVER DAYDREAM GREG FROM THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN HAS AN ELECTRONIC SIDE PROJECT SOME NICE HEAD BOBBING POPPY ELECTRONIC MUSIC IF YOU'RE INTO THOSE THINGS I THINK I HAVE A MAN CRUSH ON GREG

STUPID RANT

I'VE BEEN DOING MY BEST TO LEARN HOW TO RECORD MYSELF ON MY HOME COMPUTER MIDI DRUMS SCARE ME I HAVE HORRIBLE LATENCY WHEN RECORDING AND SPLITTING THE OUTPUT TO MY DESK SPEAKERS I'VE ONLY EVER WRITTEN 2 RIFFS THAT WERE WORTH A DAMN AND I'VE ALREADY USED THEM IN THIS TRACK AS PART OF MY EFFORT TO ACTUALLY GET MYSELF TO RECORD SOME THINGS I'VE STEPPED OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE A LITTLE BIT SO I DON'T TRY TO COPY ALL THE TRACKS I KNOW REALLY WELL BECAUSE I'M A DERIVATIVE PIECE OF TRASH IT'S A FUN PROCESS AND I'M ENJOYING IT BUT I'M REALLY BAD AT IT RANT
IHBLTTNWAITIPA
KEITH MERROW THE ARRIVAL

AN INSTRUMENTAL TECHNICAL DEATH METAL ALBUM WITH RIFFS THAT SOUND LIKE MESHUGGAH IF MESHUGGAH USED RIFFS THAT WERE MORE THAN NOTES THERE'S ALSO ATMOSPHERIC BREAKS AND SOLOS THAT REMIND ME VERY MUCH OF SOMETHING YOU'D HEAR ON HUMAN ALBUM I HAVE NOT HEARD TECHNICAL DEATH METAL WITH RIFFS THIS WEIRD GOOD SINCE GORGETS OBSCURA HARD TO BELIEVE THIS WAS MADE BY ONE GUY THE OPENING TRACK AND PILLARS OF CREATION ARE REALLY ALL YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS ALBUM

CRIMSON MASSACRE THE LUSTER OF PANDEMONIUM

BOAR TECHNICAL DEATH METAL WITH BIZARRE RIFFING I LA OBSCURA THE PRODUCTION HOLDS THIS ONE BACK A LOT BECAUSE THE GUITARS ARE SORT OF HIDDEN YOU CAN STILL MAKE OUT THE RIFFS AND THEY ARE VERY WEIRD
WHYBLT MIGHT ASWELL JUST FUCKING SPELL IT OUT WHEN IT GETS THAT BIG

MAWJSIOWIGTB
A SCAR FOR THE WICKED
CANADIAN DEATH METAL
SEEN THEM LIVE A COUPLE TIMES BOUGHT THEIR EPISTLE A MIX OF BLACK DAHLIA LAMB AND SEPULTERA GREAT LIVE BAD CRAZY GOOD LEAD GUITARIST AND DRUMMER AWESOME SOUND CHECK THEM OUT

DISHARMONIC MUNDI IS CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED
I AGREE GREAT BAND

ESSENTIALS
I HAVE A NIHILIST PATCH ON MY VEST
THERE IS ALSO A BAND CALLED REVEL IN FLESH THRASH AS FUCK YEAH M
I PLAYED IN SOME CRUST AND HARDCORE BANDS WHEN I LIVED IN JAPAN AND THEY ALL LOVED NIHILIST I REMEMBER WHEN THE COMP CAME OUT IN LIKE AND EVERY DISK UNION WAS PLAYING IT ON REPEAT LOL
TOTAL ANTHEM WHEN THEY PLAY THIS LIVE SOLID DUDES AND SOLID JAMS LOVE BUGGING THEM ABOUT TERMINAL EVERY CHANCE I GET LOVE EM
ONE OF THE BEST BANDS ROUND AT THE MOMENT I KNOW WHAT I'M LISTENING TO NOW
GREAT SONG AND GREAT ALBUM LOVE THIS BAND
SHOCKINGLY GOOD LIVE BAND TOO THESE GUYS SHOULD REALLY BE OPENING FOR IRON MAIDEN OR JUDAS PRIEST
MAN I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THESE GUYS IN YEARS I WAS INTO THEIR DEBUT ALBUM FOR A VERY BRIEF MOMENT WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT BEFORE FINDING THE THROWBACK CONCEIT WORE VERY THIN VERY QUICKLY MOST BANDS GOING FOR A THROWBACK SOUND STYLE AT LEAST ADD SOMETHING WHEREAS I FOUND THESE TO BE SUCH A COMPLETE PASTICHE THAT WHILST ADMITTEDLY VERY WELL-EXECUTED I LOST INTEREST VERY QUICKLY
EVEN THOUGH ITS A GREAT SONG IT STILL DOESN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO STELLAR PLAINS
BOICE
COMING FROM PRECAMBRIAN THIS ALBUM AND THE NEXT ANTHROPOCENTRIC WAS A MAJOR LETDOWN IT HAS SOME SONGS AND MOMENTS BUT IT LOST THE HARD EDGE I APPRECIATED IN THEIR EARLIER WORK

PELAGIAL DID A LOT TO SOOTHE THAT DISAPPOINTMENT STILL WAITING FOR ANOTHER SONG LIKE AONIAN
ANGELS CRY IS DEFINITELY THEIR MOST CELEBRATED ALBUM THOUGH PERSONALLY I PREFER TEMPLE OF SHADOWS AND REBIRTH FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE STATES CARRY ON IS GENERALLY ANTHEM SO TO SPEAK

IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT OTHER FOLKS SAY BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WUTHERING HEIGHTS IMMEDIATELY COMES TO MIND WHEN I THINK OF AGRA GREAT SONG THOUGH I ALMOST ALWAYS ENJOY COVERS
THAT COVER WAS SOMETHING I WOULD ALWAYS SKIP BECAUSE IT DIDN'T SOUND INTERESTING BUT WHEN I FINALLY LISTENED TO IT I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE SINGING IT'S DEFINITELY WHAT COMES TO MIND WHEN I WANT TO SHOW OFF AMAZING VOCALS IN METAL

ALSO CLASSIC AGRA RULES
DEEP PURPLE STILL EXISTS
DEE NUTS

HOLY SHIT WHY
I WAS NOT EXPECTING HAWKWIND
I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IT'S NOT A GREAT LINEUP OR EVEN A REALLY GOOD ONE BUT I COUNT MORE THAN A DOZEN GOOD BANDS AND THAT'S AN ODD OCCURRENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE MASSIVE FESTIVALS
DTP AND JAPETH AT THE SAME SHOW BEW LADS
SOLID LINEUP I DON'T CARE FOR THE BIGGER BANDS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD SURPRISES AMONG THE SMALLER ONES
IF YOU'RE THINKING HEY THERE ACTUALLY ARE A FEW GOOD BANDS IN HERE REMEMBER THAT THE DAYS PASS IS WORTH

IF YOU'RE STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS FEST IS SHIT THEY SOLD ALL OF THOSE PASSES FULL PRICE BEFORE EVEN ANNOUNCING A SINGLE BAND

I'VE BEEN TO THIS FEST FOR MANY YEARS AND IT'S REALLY SHIT NOW VERY POOR ORGANISATION GATES OPEN APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTE BEFORE SHOWS START RESULTING IN FIRST BANDS PLAYING IN FRONT OF FIVE PEOPLE ASTRONOMICAL PRICES TICKET BEER FOOD EVERYTHING NOT SO GREAT AND MOOOOST OF ALL ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AUDIENCE PEOPLE DISGUISED AS COWS OR PIKACHUS EVERYWHERE PEOPLE FUCKING COSHING AND AT ATMOSPHERIC BLACK METAL SHOWS KIDS AND TOURISTS EVERYWHERE

YEAH DON'T GO THERE FRANCE HAS OTHER FESTS
I WONDER HOW LONG THEY ARGUED ABOUT WHICH GROUPING TO PUT NAILS IN

ASIDE FROM SOME OBVIOUS MISSES UP TOP THIS ACTUALLY SEEMS APPEALING I WOULDN'T TRAVEL FOR IT BUT IF I LIVED IN FRANCE I'D DEFINITELY GO
WHAT A CLUSTERFUCK AS USUAL
WHY'S THE COMMENT SECTION SO NEGATIVE ABOUT THIS LINEUP I QUITE LIKE MANY BANDS ON HERE EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LIKE LANKIN PARK ANYMORE EDGY YEAR OLD ME WOULD BE ANGRY IF I DIDN'T SEE THEM THEY MUST BE FUN LIVE
HUH I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW UGLY KID JOE AND EVERGREEN WERE STILL ACTIVE
UGLY KID JOE
VERY JEALOUS IN CALIFORNIA
THIS IS BASICALLY OF MY CONCERT BUCKETLIST CRAMMED INTO ONE FESTIVAL
THE FACT THAT PERTURBATOR IS TUCKED IN THERE LIKE WHAT THE FLYING FUCK I KNOW EUROPE TENDS TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR FESTIVALS BUT PERTURBATOR THEY'RE A FUTUREWAVE SYNTHWAVE PROJECT TALK ABOUT STANDING OUT LIKE A TURD IN A PUNCHBOWL HALACHA
HOW DARE THEY PUT GHOUL SO SMALL ON THE BOTTOM UNACCEPTABLE
DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS SLAYER DEEP PURPLE STEEL PANTHER DEVIN TOWNSEND DOETH BEHEMOTH NAILS EXHUMED GHOST BATH DEAFHEAVEN BEYOND CREATION BARONESS PRIMUS EP ELECTRIC WIZARD BOC PENTAGRAM CHELSEA WOLFE RED FANG HAWKWIND BLOOD CEREMONY BONGRIPPER SUB-ROSA AND UFAMMUT ARE ALL FUCKING AMAZING IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD TO SEE A FESTIVAL LIKE HELLFEST RECOGNIZING SOME NEW AMAZING TALENT YES THERE ARE SOME BAD BANDS ON HERE IE LANKIN PARK BUT I THINK THE GOOD OUTWEIGHS THE BAD
HELLFEST


LANKIN PARK
HMM SO IS HELLFEST ALWAYS THIS ECLECTIC
A FEW SURPRISES HERE AND THERE I'M REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT TRUST IN I'M PRETTY SURE THAT IT WILL BE REALLY BAD BUT THE FIRST ALBUMS ARE CLASSICS YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO BE FRENCH TO THINK THAT THOUGH SO I'LL PROBABLY WATCH THEIR SHOW ANYWAY
MINUS THE DUDE ROCK IT'S A SOLID LINEUP GLAD TO SEE HELMET STILL DOING SHOWS
NO GOAJIRO AS ONE OF FEW FRENCH METAL BANDS I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE IN CONSIDERATION LET ALONE DESIRE TO ATTEND
IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT DOWNLOAD HAVE ANNOUNCED RECENTLY
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST HELLFEST I WON'T BE ATTENDING DOESN'T LOOK LIKE I'M MISSING OUT
ARE WE JUST GOING TO IGNORE UGLY KID JOE

THEY'RE STILL AROUND

IS ANYBODY ELSE SEEING THIS
NOSTROMO IS BACK
SKEPTICISM
SO HELLFEST IS NEW WACKEN NOW WACKEN USED TO GET SOLD OUT BEFORE ANNOUNCING THE LINE UP AND THEN LINE UP IN SOME YEARS WERE GOOD AND SOME YEARS IT WAS OKAY LAST YEAR AND LAST TO LAST YEAR HELLFEST LINE UP WAS STELLAR TICKETS WERE SOLD AFTER ANNOUNCING LINE UP
SO ARCHON INFAUSTUS ARE PLAYING AFTER AN YEAR HIATUS LINE-UP IS DEVIANT WITH A BUNCH OF SESSION MEMBERS FROM OTHER FRENCH BANDS DIAPSIQUIR HELL MILITIA I WONDER IF THAT WILL BE ANY GOOD
SINCE I'M A RELATIVE NEWBIE LISTENING TO METAL AND KNOW AROUND BANDS FROM THE LINEUP CAN SOMEONE TELL ME THE BLACK DEATH MELODIC DEATH THRASH BANDS FROM THE LINEUP THAT I SHOULD BE EXCITED ABOUT

KNOW ABOUT EMPEROR BEHEMOTH JAPETH POWERWOLF ALCES
THAT IS A FUCKING WEIRD MIX OF BANDS HOLY SHIT
I BOUGHT TICKETS AND TOLD MYSELF I'D MAKE MY DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS WORTH THE TRIP FROM CHICAGO AFTER THE LINEUP WAS RELEASED I GAGGED AT FIRST SIGHT OF THE HEADLINERS BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A LOT WORTH GOING FOR IN THE REMAINDER OF THE LINEUP NOT A SLAM DUNK THOUGH I'M GOING TO NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS ONE FOR A BIT
I MOSTLY CAN'T STAND ANY BAND ON THE FIRST THREE ROWS BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S PRETTY GOOD
NAILS ARE GONNA BRING THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN
SYRACUSE HELLFEST THIS HORSESHIT
I DIDN'T KNOW IN FLAMES HAD ANY MEMBERS OUTSIDE OF JESPER STROMBLAD
PETER AND DANIEL OWN A BREWERY TOGETHER I'M SURE HE SAW HOW MUCH HAPPIER DANIEL WAS NOT HAVING TO PLAY THE DRIVEL THEY'VE BEEN RELEASING
I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT GIVEN THE POST TITLE
WOW I JUST REALIZED THEY HAVE NO ORIGINAL MEMBERS LEFT WEIRD I WONDER IF THE OTHER GUYS ARE GONNA START THEIR OWN GROUP
ABANDON SINKING SHIP
JESPER CONFIRMED THAT A DIMENSION ZERO EP IS ON ITS WAY THEY NEVER DID HAVE A FULL TIME BASSIST ON BOARD
I KNOW THIS SUB IS DEVASTATED BUT YOU'LL ALL BE OKAY GIVE IT TIME
WOULDN'T YOU
I WAS OK WITH DANIEL LEAVING BUT NOW PETER AS WELL AT LEAST I GET TO SEE HIM PLAY WITH THEM ONE MORE TIME TOMORROW
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THE BAND THAT MADE THE JESTER RACE HAS NOW MORPHED INTO THIS
PIGGYBACKING QUESTION

HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE EVER SEEN IN FLAMES PLAY ANYTHING FROM THE JESTER RACE

I RECALL DISTINCTLY GETTING GIDDY LIKE A SCHOOL GIRL WHEN THEY PLAYED DEAD ETERNITY IN LIKE WHEN I FIRST SAY THEM
SAD NEWS INDEED AND AM I THE THE ONLY ONE WHO LIKES THEIR LATEST ALBUM
I HAVE TICKETS TO SEE THEM IN LONDON AT THE O2 IN JANUARY WITH DISTURBED AND AVENGED SEVENFOLD WILL THEY STILL PLAY
AS A VERY NEW IN FLAMES FAN ONLY LISTENED TO JESTER WHORACLE COLONY ARE THEY WORTH TRYING TO SEE ON THIS TOUR THEY'LL BE HERE IN DENVER NEXT WEEK DEBATING GOING I'VE HEARD THEY DON'T PLAY ANY OF THE OLD STUFF
HE IS SUCH A GOOD BASSIST AS WELL
HONESTLY I THOUGHT THE RECENT ALBUM WAS THE LAST IN FLAMES ALBUM
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE TERRIBLE MUSIC
HE IS SUCH A GOOD BASSIST AS WELL

MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THOSE ALBUMS MADE THE CUT BECAUSE THEY'RE FUCKING KILLER BUT THAT ASIDE IF YOU GO IN ORDER ON THOSE TWO SECTIONS YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF HOW THINGS DEVELOPED IN A RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME

SOME OF THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT BANDS THE GENRE'S EVER SEEN OTHERS MADE RELATIVELY LITTLE IMPACT BY COMPARISON I EAST HEAVY LOAD RIOT NIGHT SUN LEGEND CLOVEN HOOF

THERE WASN'T MUCH LIKE THAT DUNGOL ALBUM WHEN IT CAME OUT AND WOULDN'T BE FOR ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY MISSING ANYTHING IT JUST SCRATCHES A DIFFERENT ITCH THAN DIAMOND HEAD AND IS A FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD QUIRKIER ALBUM

NIGHT SUN BRINGS IN SOME PROG WEIRDNESS THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE

LISTEN TO WHAT UFO WERE DOING BEFORE PHENOMENON AND THEN GIVE PHENOMENON ANOTHER SHOT THAT SHOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE CLEARER WHAT PHENOMENON MEANT

SCORPIONS SAILS OF CHARON AND HE'S A WOMAN SHE'S A MAN IN PARTICULAR ARE BOTH YEARS AHEAD OF THEIR TIME

LEGEND IS A VERY NICHE ALBUM AND ONE THAT WENT ALMOST UNHEARD FOR A WHILE BUT AGAIN VERY AHEAD OF ITS TIME
I THINK IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE MADE THAT LIST MAYBE ALMOST A YEAR AGO AND IN THE MATTER OF A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH USERS AND MODS AND THERE HASN'T BEEN GLARING CONTROVERSY EVEN WITH THE BLACK METAL SECTION BEING THE MOST DIFFICULT TO CRAFT I AM JUST SAYING METAL EVOLUTION THIS SUB CAN BE CONTRACTED OUT FOR WORK AND WE CAN BILL ALL
I'M PRETTY SURE I'M MISSING SOMETHING JUST CAN'T REALLY FIGURE IT OUT

IF YOU WERE TO COMPILE A LIST OF THE BEST AND MOST REVERED CLASSICS OF HEAVY METAL NOBODY IS GOING TO LIKE EVERY ALBUM ON THE LIST WHAT THESE LISTS ARE FOR IS TO GIVE YOU A BROAD BRUSH PICTURE OF THE GENRE AS A WHOLE EACH PERSON IS GOING TO HAVE HIS OWN JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY AND WILL INEVITABLY HAVE ALBUMS HE LIKES MORE THAN OTHERS

IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE MISSING SOMETHING JUST KEEP DISCOVERING NEW MUSIC AND MAYBE A FEW YEARS FROM NOW GO BACK AND REVISIT THE LISTS AND MAYBE THEN YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER APPRECIATION OF THE ALBUMS CONTAINED THEREIN
TASTE IS SUBJECTIVE I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH EVERY ALBUM ON THAT LIST BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ALBUMS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF METAL AS A GENRE THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS ON HERE WHO WOULD COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH YOU ABOUT CRITH DUNGOL BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE RIGHT AND YOU'RE WRONG JUST KEEP AN OPEN MIND WHEN YOU GO INTO EACH LISTING YOU AREN'T GOING TO LOVE EVERYTHING BUT YOU'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO APPRECIATE THE REALLY GOOD STUFF IF YOU LISTEN TO THE STUFF YOU DON'T LIKE SO MUCH

PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE ALBUMS ON THERE HAVE A DECENT AMOUNT OF CRITICAL ACCLAIM TOO CHECK OUT EACH ALBUM IN ENCYCLOPAEDIA METALLISM AND READ THE REVIEWS TO GET AN IDEA FOR WHY EACH ONE IS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT
YOU MIGHT WANNA CHECK THIS
YEAH ADDING TO ALL OF THIS THE LIST YOU PROVIDED IS REALLY INCOMPLETE AND FAVORS THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES A IN A HUGE MARGIN OVER MORE CONTEMPORARY RELEASES NOT TO KNOCK THE LIST DOWN BUT IT IS DEFINITELY OUTDATED AND COULD USE SOME MODERNITY INFUSED INTO IT
SEEING THEM BACK TO BACK TWO NIGHTS WITH SLEEP IN JANUARY SUPER STOKED
THIS ALBUM IS ACTUALLY MY FAVORITE KELVINS WORK

HEX ME IS AWESOME AND ITS A TRAVESTY THAT ITS ONLY A MINUTE AND SOME CHANGE LONG
SHINING DOES THE SAME SONGS IN DIFFERENT ORDER SINCE IV KINDA BORING
I REMEMBER HEARING THIS BAND AND ATHEIST OUT OF THE BLUE IN HIGH SCHOOL I HAD NEVER HEARD JAZZ FUSION IN DEATH METAL BEFORE THEY IMMEDIATELY CHANGED HOW I LOOKED AT PROGRESSIVE METAL AND DEATH METAL AND CHANGED HOW I LOOKED AT WRITING MY OWN MUSIC

ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED DEATH METAL BANDS AND THEIR NEW STUFF IS STILL AMAZING I'M BUT A WAVE TO IS MY FAVORITE SONG OFF THIS ALBUM BUT CELESTIAL VOYAGE WAS ALWAYS A CLOSE SECOND
I WOULD MURDER SOMEONE FOR FOCUS TO GET A DAN SWAN BRUCE SOORD OR STEVEN WILSON REMIX AND REMASTER
THESE GUYS WERE SO AHEAD OF THEIR TIME KIND OF A TRAGEDY THAT THEY WERE SO UNDER APPRECIATED WHEN THEY STARTED OUT TOO WEIRD FOR DEATH METAL FANS TOO HARSH FOR PROG FUSION FANS APPARENTLY THEY WERE GETTING BOOED DURING THEIR TOUR WITH CANNIBAL CORPSE

I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT I GOT TO SEE THEM AFTER THEY REUNITED AND RELEASED TRACED IN AIR THE LINEUP WITH TYMON AND ROBIN WAS GREAT AND THE SHOW KICKED MAJOR ASS THEY WERE PLAYING WITH DREAM THEATER WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A MUCH BETTER FIT AS WELL THAN A TRADITIONAL DEATH METAL BAND
USUALLY DEATH METAL THAT IS PROGRESSIVE IS CALLED TECH DEATH BUT THIS IS CLEARLY A FUSION BETWEEN DEATH METAL AND PROGRESSIVE METAL WHAT A WEIRD SONG I BETTER CHECK OUT THE ALBUM TOO
GROWLS SHITTY VOCODER
SHAME THEY BROKE UP BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE INGRINDTATION TYPE STUFF AND THE AMOUNT OUT THERE IS INCREDIBLY LIMITED
THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS A MONSTER
LOVED THIS ALBUM IT WAS RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING EVER RELEASED A BIT SADDENED THEY DIDN'T SUSTAIN THIS LINE UP BUT AT LEAST I DID GET TO SEE THEM WHEN THEY TOURED THE ALBUM A BIT

VERY MUCH A FAN OF EMBOSSED AS WELL KIND OF LOST TRACK OF THEM AFTER THIS ONE THOUGH DIDN'T FIND IT AS APPEALING ANYMORE
THE DRUMMING ON THIS IS TOO GOOD
THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES SUCH A UNIQUE SOUND
MOST COMPLETE ALBUM EVER IT HAS EVERYTHING A MUSIC LOVER COULD WANT
MAN I HAVEN'T LISTENED TO EPHES DEATH IN A COUPLE YEARS NOW SUCH CREATIVE MUSIC I USED TO THROW ON PALETTE AND THROUGH MY DOG'S EYES ON REPEAT
ONE OF THE BEST
LOVE THEM
ALWAYS ROOM FOR FIFTH ANGEL FOREVER
ABSOLUTE CLASSIC
BETWEEN YOU ALL IN ASH BORER AND YOUR SUBSEQUENT PROJECTS AND LABELS AND GUYS LIKE MICHAEL THE KARLSTAD BROTHERS YELLOW EYES AND THEIR PROJECTS AND LABELS IN NEW YORK YOU ALL HAVE BEEN BUILDING SOMETHING VERY EXCITING OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS OR SO IT SEEMS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST YOU ALL ARE USHERING IN A PROPER WAVE OF UBM SOMETHING I'VE LOOSELY DESCRIBED IT AS THINKING MAN'S METAL BEFORE WOULD YOU SAY THAT'S ACCURATE


FUCKING STOP NOBODY CARES WHAT YOU LOOSELY DESCRIBE US BLACK METAL AS AND NO IT'S NOT THINKING MAN'S MUSIC IT'S SIMPLE BLACK METAL THAT SOUNDS GOOD THEY AREN'T TRYING TO SOLVE COMPLEX MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS THEY'RE PLAYING MUSIC
INTERVIEW ALSO CONFIRMS NEW FANUM EP FOR EARLY NEXT YEAR
REALLY DIGGING ROTTEN FIRMAMENT REMINDS ME A BIT OF PALE CHALICE
THIS MIGHT JUST SQUEAK IT'S WAY INTO MY YEAR END LIST
NOOOOOOOO I'M UNABLE TO LISTEN TO THIS TODAY AHHHGGHH
HITE ARTICLE ASIDE PSYCHED TO SEE THESE GUYS IN JANUARY
THIS ARTICLE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY I HATE NOISE
I DON'T MEAN THAT AS SOME SORT OF ELITIST STATEMENT MORE THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT ATTEMPTING TO REINVENT THE WHEEL OR REINTERPRET BLACK METAL AS SOMETHING THAT CAN EXIST FOR MORE MAINSTREAM CONSUMPTION WE ALSO HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING FUCKING STUPID TO CAUSE AN UPROAR AMONGST NERDS ON THE INTERNET

AS A GUY WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVED TIME IS UP THIS ALBUM WAS A LET DOWN STILL GREAT SONG
THEIR MUSIC DOESN'T ALWAYS GRAB ME BUT I HAVE TO CONCEDE THAT THEY PUT ON QUITE A LIVE SHOW I FELT LIKE I TRAVELED BACK IN TIME WHEN I SAW THEM
SUCH AN INCREDIBLY OVERLOOKED UNDERRATED BAND
JUST GOT MY VINYL COPY IN THE MAIL TODAY THIS ALBUM IS A THING OF BEAUTY
THEY'RE COMING TO MY SHITHOLE AREA OF PENNSYLVANIA SOME TIME THIS WINTER I CAN'T WAIT
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LIVE TWO BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS VENUE AND STILL MANAGED TO MISS BOTH NIGHTS OF THIS SHOW
THEY'LL BE IN SEATTLE MID DECEMBER I'M SUPER PUMPED HAVEN'T SEEN THEM SINCE ENEMY OF THE SUN
I HAD TO CLOSE UP BOTH NIGHTS OF THAT SHOW REALLY WISH I COULD HAVE GONE TO SEE THAT LINEUP
PENTAGRAM BITCHES

LOVE THEM EVEN THE TWO HASSELVANDER ALBUMS THAT THIS SONG COMES FROM I EVEN WILL GO SO FAR AS TO SAY SHOW EM HOW IS AN INCREDIBLE ALBUM HOWEVER I THINK I PREFER REVIEW YOUR CHOICES WHEN IT COMES TO THE TWO HASSELVANDER ALBUMS REGARDLESS PENTAGRAM IS THE SHIT AND I WILL ALWAYS UNVOTE IT
JOE HASSELVANDER REALLY CAME INTO HIS OWN ON AND I THINK BOTH HE AND BOBBY FEEL IT'S ONE OF THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST RECORDINGS CAN'T SAY I DISAGREE FROM THE FIRST NOTE OF THIS SONG TO THE FINAL CHAOTIC MOMENTS OF TARGET THE ALBUM CRUSHES YOU WITH SOME OF THE MOST DEMENTED PERFORMANCES EITHER MEMBER HAS EVER PUT OUT IT'S SICK TWISTED AND MANAGES TO STAY CATCHY AND GROOVY ALL AT ONCE YOU JUST CAN'T SAY NO TO THAT
GOOD SONG GOOD BAND
THIS SONG CHANGED MY LIFE
LOVE THIS ALBUM MY PERSONAL FAVORITE FROM IT IS SACKET SUCH AN EPIC SONG
BRAIN DRILL WERE ONE OF MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO MORE EXTREME METAL WHEN I WAS ONLY INTO INTRO THRASH BANDS LIKE MEGADEATH AND SLAYER I REMEMBER THINKING I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHATS GOING ON IN THE SONGS BUT I KNEW I LIKED SOMETHING ABOUT IT THEN I ACTUALLY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED TO THE MUSIC AND JUST KEPT GOING FROM THERE
THIS BAND IS THE BUTT TECHDEATH OF BUTT TECHDEATH
THIS IS SHAPING UP TO BE ONE HELL OF AN ALBUM
MOST ANTICIPATED ALBUM OF
SATAN

HOLY SHIT OF YOU SIGNED UP ALREADY I WAS EXPECTING LIKE AND WE WOULD ALL GET EACH OTHER OUR FAVORITE SUMMONING SHIRTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE ARE PHYSICAL TIERS SO I HAVE YOU ALL GROUP BY REGION INCLUDING USA CANADA UK GREATER EUROPE ANTARCTICA SCANDINAVIA AND SOUTH EAST ASIA THERE IS PERSON IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSSIA THAT I AM LOOKING FOR REGIONAL MATCHES

SO YOU ALL WILL GET YOUR MATCHES ON FRIDAY BUT I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND PROTOCOL TO GET THROUGH

OVER HALF OF YOU DIDN'T GIVE A NAME FOR YOUR ADDRESS I UNDERSTAND NOT WANTING TO GIVE OUR YOUR NAME TO WEIRDOS ON THE INTERNET BUT I AM SURE YOUR STUFF WILL STILL BE DELIVERED WITH OR WITHOUT A NAME TO YOUR MATCH AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT CERTIFY IT OTHERWISE IF YOU REQUIRE IT WILL BE A HILARIOUS TIME AT THE POST OFFICE LOOKING AT IDS BUT NOT REALLY BECAUSE THERE IS A LINE BEHIND YOU

WHEN DO WE REVEAL WHO WE HAD DO YOU ALL WANT TO DO THEM THROUGHOUT DECEMBER IN GENERAL DISCUSSION THREADS OR HAVE TWO BIG SHARE THREADS ON THE BEST DEMO AND THE 7TH TOP I HAVE NEVER DONE SECRET SANTA BEFORE AS I ALWAYS NEVER RESPONDED TO THOSE WORK EMAILS BUT I AM GUESSING A PERSON POSTS WHAT THEY GOT AND THEN THE OTHER PERSON RESPONDS IF THEY WANT AND SAY IT WAS THEM HOW DO OFFICE PEOPLE DO THIS




A QUESTION ON FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND CROWDFUNDING

NOW I AM NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND SAY THAT I PAY FOR EVERY RECORD I OBTAIN I DO USE BANDCAMP QUITE A BIT AND TRY TO PICK UP AS MUCH MATERIAL FROM THERE AS I CAN BUT I ALSO USE PONTIFY WHICH IS BASICALLY NOT PAYING INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS EVEN IF LEGAL AND YES I DO PIRATE FOR SOME BANDS USUALLY QUESTIONABLE OR POPULAR BANDS

LETS TAKE A LIST OF EVERY ALBUM I'VE OBTAINED THIS YEAR PROBABLY OVER A HUNDRED I TRY TO KEEP RETURNING TO THEM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO SEE IF I LIKE THEM IF I DONT RETURN TO THEM DELETED

THEREIN LIES THE ISSUE DO I PAY FOR EVERY ALBUM EVEN IF I'LL GET BORED OF IT AFTER A FEW LISTENS AND DELETE IT I TRY TO MAKE EDUCATED GUESSES BUT SAY I BOUGHT BELFRY FROM THIS YEAR HIGHLY RATED ALBUM I ENJOYED IT WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT BUT NOW I'M KINDA BORED OF ALL BUT ONE TRACK I'LL PROBABLY DELETE IT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN I START AFRESH

THAT SAID I ALSO ILLEGALLY OBTAINED DEATH FORTRESS THIS YEAR BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T SEE THE APPEAL OF IT WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT BUT EVERYONE WAS RAVING ABOUT IT SO I FIGURED I'D TRY IT A FEW MORE TIMES IT GREW ON ME AND NOW I LOVE IT

I MEAN I BUY LITERALLY EVERY BOOK I READ AND THAT IS A LOT OF BOOKS AND I PAY TO SEE JUST ABOUT EVERY MOVIE I'M INTERESTED IN IN CINEMAS MOST TV SHOWS I WATCH ARE ON NETFLIX SO REALLY IT'S JUST MUSIC THAT I LET DOWN THE ARTISTS IN SOME WAYS

HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE REALLY BUY EVERY ALBUM THEY MAY DISCOVER IN A GIVEN YEAR
BEST METAL ALBUMS THAT HAVE A SCIFI SPIN TO THEM I LOVE RECORDS LIKE THE KEY FROM NOCTURNES AND THE COSMIC BLACK METAL THAT INQUISITION DOES BUT SONGS THAT HAVE KIND OF A SCIFI FEELING TO THEM ARE NOT THAT COMMON
MY MIND IS STILL BLOWN AFTER DISCOVERING ANDY LAROCQUE PLAYS IN KING DIAMOND AND ON INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT PATTERNS DEATH ARE THERE ANY OTHER ARTISTS WHO PLAY IN BANDS OF VERY DIFFERENT GENRES BUT SOUND GREAT IN BOTH

THE ONES I CAN THINK OF ARE

JOHN COBBETT HAMMERS OF MISFORTUNE SLOUGH EEG HEAVY LUDICRA BLACK

GENE HOGAN DEATH DEATH DARK ANGEL TESTAMENT THRASH FEAR FACTORY INDUSTRIAL

DAVE LOMBARDO SLAYER THRASH FANTOMS AMANTE GARDE

BIO RAINBOW TRAD PROTO METAL BLACK SABBATH HEAVY DOOM SOLO HEAVY

IHSAHN EMPEROR BLACK IHSAHN PROGRESSIVE

MIKAEL AKERFELDT JAPETH PROGRESSIVE BLOODBATH DEATH KATATONIA DEATH DOOM

COLIN MARSTON KRALLICE AMANTE BLACK DYSRHYTHMIA TECHNICAL INSTRUMENTAL GORGETS TECHNICAL DEATH


JUMPING OFF OF A TOOL QUESTION I ASKED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE WORST ANABASES AND WHY
I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME SORT OF WHERE YOU START LISTENING TO ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE BANDS BUT IT JUST DOESN'T DO IT FOR YOU SO YOU GO HEAVIER INTO SOMETHING MORE EXTREME BUT STILL NOTHING AND YOU GO EVEN HEAVIER INTO THE ABYSS OF THE OBSCURE BUT NOTHING CAN SCRATCH THAT SO YOU JUST PUT ON SOMETHING AS FAR FROM METAL AS POSSIBLE AND IT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR

WHAT SONGS OR ARTISTS HAVE SAVED YOU FROM THE TRENCH OF AND RESET YOU TO YOUR NORMAL STATE

FOR ME HOLD THE LINE BY TOTO WILL SOLVE ANY PROBLEM AND REGINA SPECTOR STYX AND DAFT PUNK WILL ALWAYS SATISFY ME WHEN DEATH OR EXODUS CAN'T
COLLAGE FOR THIS MONTH HETP

POST YOURS
WHAT ALBUMS HAVE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED YOU THIS YEAR FOR ME IT'S GOT TO BE EXPERIMENT OF EXISTENCE
SO DOOM METAL I HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A BAND JUST FROM READING IT'S DOOM IS THERE ANY LIST OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS LIST BUT MORE OFFICIAL AND LESS OF A JOKE
WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF REALLY STRANGE VOCALS THAT CAN BE DIVISIVE

ALL OF THE COMMON WEIRD VOCALS THAT TEND TO BOTHER PEOPLE LIKE KING DIAMOND DEMILICH INQUISITION MANILLA ROAD EARLY FATES WARNING ARE ALL STYLES I ENJOY NOW

SO I'M WONDERING WHAT COMMON BANDS AM I FORGETTING HERE

WHAT ARE SOME OTHER STRANGE STYLES THAT STRETCH WHAT IS CONSIDERED GOOD OR ARTISTIC

WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF JUST PLAIN BAD VOCALS
I HAVENT REALLY KEPT UP TO DATE WITH THE RELEASE THIS YEAR SO WHAT ARE YOUR TOP AT THE MOMENT AND WHAT ALBUMS ARE COMING OUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR THAT I SHOULD CHECK OUT

EDIT ANY GENRES
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME THE EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATE VERSIONS OF THE SOLO ON THE SONG SEASONS IN THE ABYSS THE YOUTUBE AND PONTIFY VERSIONS HAVE DIFFERENT SOLOS CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE THE TWO VERSIONS COME FROM
I'M INTERESTED IN SUB GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS OF METAL

YESTERDAY I WAS LOOKING FOR MORE BANDS HAD A SIMILAR SOUND TO WINDER AND STUMBLED UPON THIS ARTICLE ON TOILET OV HELL SOGNAMETAL BASICALLY IT'S A LOOSELY COINED TERMED REFERRING TO BANDS THAT ROSE OUT OF THE ASHES OF WINDER IN THE SIGN OG FJORDANE REGION OF NORWAY I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPER INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT A RELATIVELY SMALL REGION PRODUCING A VERY SPECIFIC STYLE OF MUSIC

I WAS WONDERING WHAT WERE SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF THIS I KNOW MORE POPULAR EXAMPLES WOULD INCLUDE THE GOTHENBURG STYLE OF MELODIC DEATH METAL AND MAYBE CASCADIAN BLACK METAL
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING FOR MY GIRLFRIEND AND FAMILY HAS LEFT ME A BIT DISADVANTAGED WHAT ARE THE BEST FREE ALBUMS YOU KNOW OF ANY GENRE WILL DO

HERE'S SOME INSTRUMENTAL BLACK METAL TO GET THINGS STARTED
HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU LISTEN TO A NEW ALBUM IN A ROW FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ENJOY A NEW ALBUM WILL YOU IMMEDIATELY LISTEN TO IT AGAIN OR SIT ON IT FOR A FEW DAYS FIRST
WHO ALL AM I GONNA SEE AT THE TELSTAR FLOTSAM AND JETSAM SHOW IN ATLANTA TOMORROW AS LONG AS NOTHING CATASTROPHIC HAPPENS STILL TRYING TO KEEP THAT POSSIBILITY IN MIND CAUSE THIS HASN'T BEEN MY YEAR HAVING HAD SEVERAL THINGS END UP GETTING FUCKED EITHER THE DAY OF OR NIGHT BEFORE TRYING NOT TO BE TOO EXCITED JUST IN CASE

ALSO FOR ANY LOCALS ARE THERE ANY COOL RECORD STORES I SHOULD CHECK OUT
HOW MANY ALBUMS ARE IN CONTENTION FOR YOUR TOP OF THE YEAR LIST I'VE GOT A SOLID THAT ARE ON THE LIST WITHOUT A DOUBT VEATOR MOONSORROW SUNYATA ORANSSI PAZUZU COBALT MARE COGNITUM SHRINE BUT THOSE REMAINING SLOTS ARE BEING FOUGHT FOR BY A DOZEN OR MORE OTHER ALBUMS

ALSO AS AN ASIDE ARE WE INCLUDING WARDRUNA ON OUR TOP LISTS I HESITATE TO CALL IT METAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ON METAL ARCHIVES AND IS VERY MUCH METAL IN SPIRIT
THOUGHTS ON THE PHOBOCOSM SHRINE ULCERATE SHOW SATURDAY

PROBABLY THE SMALLEST SHOW I'VE EVER BEEN TO AND FIRST TRULY UNDERGROUND

VENUE WAS COOL SHOW TOOK PLACE IN THE ATTIC OF A TAVERN THE STAGE WAS HARDLY A STAGE

I THINK THE FRONTSMAN OF PHOBOCOSM FELL ASLEEP ON THE BENCH NEXT TO ME AFTER SET

DIDN'T EXPECT SHRINE TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC UPRIGHT AND FOR HIM AND THE FRONTSMAN TO BE BOWING THERE INSTRUMENTS THAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE NIGHT AND I LOVE HOW THEY DID ALL SORTS OF SOUND EFFECTS

THE GUITARIST OF ULCERATE HAS A REALLY LONG NECK

I GOT TO TALK TO BOTH FRONTSMAN OF SHRINE AND ULCERATE AFTER THE SHOW AND TELL THEM I LOVED THEIR NEW RECORDS TOO BAD I WAS TOO TIRED TO HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION ÞORBJÖRN LOOKED REALLY SPACED OUT TOO THOUGH PROBABLY HIGH PAUL WAS NICE
WHY ISN'T CONSIDERED METAL
SO HELLFEST SAID THEY'D ANNOUNCE THEIR LINE-UP MID NOVEMBER AND STILL NO LINE-UP IT'S A LONG SHOT BUT DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON WHEN IT COULD BE OUT OR WHAT THE HOLD UP IS
HELLFEST JUST RELEASED THEIR LINEUP I AM COMING THIS YEAR FROM AMERICA I AM PUMPED BUT WAS HOPING FOR MORE BLACK VIKING METAL YET THERE'S ENOUGH PROG AND DOOM STONER METAL TO KEEP ME HAPPY PLUS FUCKING EMPEROR WTF IS WITH AEROSMITH THOUGH JESUS
NAME YOUR AV SUBGENRE AND THE MOST UNEXPECTED COUNTRY YOU'VE HEARD A GOOD ALBUM FROM THAT SUBGENRE OUT OF TRAD AND I FOUND THIS FROM TURKEY
GOT TICKETS TO MAX IGOR CAVALERO RETURN TO ROOTS TOMORROW FRIEND OF MINE SAW THE SHOW IN MUNICH YESTERDAY AND SAID IT WAS RUBBISH ANYONE ELSE HERE SEEN THEM

NOT THE BIGGEST FAN OF ROOTS BUT I WAS STILL LOOKING FORWARD TO IT NOW MY BUDDY KILLED MY BUZZ
THIS WEEK IN BOSTON IS PRETTY GREAT FOR CONCERTS TOMORROW NIGHT IS ANIMALS AS LEADERS HINDHAND FRIDAY AND RED FANG SUNDAY

ANYONE GOING TO ANY OF THESE
ANYONE KNOW OF GOOD METAL BANDS WITH WOMEN AS LEAD VOCALISTS I'VE ONLY EVER SEEN TWO BUTCHER BABIES AND SORCERESS BUTCHER BABIES WERE OKAY BUT NOTHING SPECIAL SORCERESS WAS AWFUL
ANYONE KNOW OF ANY BANDS THAT MIX BLACK AND DOOM METAL MY PREFERENCE IS USUALLY THE MORE ATMOSPHERIC STUFF BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
I REALLY ENJOY FIRST EP BEFORE THEY GOT TOO THE SONG THE WOODS IS MY FAVORITE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER ALBUMS LIKE THIS BESIDES ISIS RUSSIAN CIRCLES OF COURSE
IF YOU WERE GOING TO BUY ONE EXTREME METAL ALBUM ON VINYL WHAT WOULD IT BE SOMETHING THAT'S SOLID ALL THE WAY THROUGH BUT SOUNDS BADASS PLAYED ON A RECORD
WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A FAN OF BANDS NOT JUST SOMEONE WHO LIKES AN ALBUM BUT IS A FAN OF THE BAND AND FOLLOW THEM PAST THEIR PRIME

IT'S NOT AN OBJECTIVE OR RATIONAL THING BUT I DO FEEL A SORT OF ATTACHMENT TO MY FAVORITE BANDS JUDAS PRIEST IRON MAIDEN BLIND GUARDIAN ETC I GET IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY NOT TO PUT PEOPLE ON A PEDASTLE BUT LIKE I SAID IT'S NOT A RATIONAL THING IT'S INVOLUNTARY I LOOK UP TO THEM WANT THEM TO SUCCEED AND WILL CUT THEM SOME SLACK IF THEY RELEASE A DUD ALBUM I HAVE RESPECT FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED MY LIFE
ANYONE KNOW WHEN HALLOWEEN IS GONNA ANNOUNCE THE REST OF THEIR TOUR DATES FOR THE REUNION TOUR WITH KAI AND FISKE
JUST SAYING I LIKED SUNYATA BEFORE IT WAS COOL


ACCEPTING MEDALS PLEASE
ANYONE ELSE LISTEN TO NWOTHM MODERN TRAD ON PONTIFY I'M MAKING A GIANT PLAYLIST OF IT AND I'M WONDERING WHAT BANDS I AM MISSING

USER PLAYLIST
THIS POST GOT DOWN VOTED FOR GOD KNOWS WHAT BUT I DON'T CARE KEITH MERROW AND WES HAUCH MAKING MUSIC IS A DAMN GOOD THING FOR METAL FANS

AMBIENT KELT AND EARLY S DEATH METAL SHOULDN'T BE THE ONLY THINGS ALLOWED ON THE SUB


EDIT I GUESS GENERAL DISCUSSION MEANS GENERAL ASSIMILATION AND CONFORMITY THREAD
I LIKE BOTH ALBUMS A LOT BUT I ADORE THIS ONE
SO YEAH THIS IS REALLY WEIRD EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE HEARD THEIR PREVIOUS WORK I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO PLACE IT SINCE IT'S REALLY DARK HEAVY METAL BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME PSYCH PROG AND EVEN MOMENTS ON THIS RECORD THIS SONG IN PARTICULAR HAS A REALLY SECTION SO I FELT COMPELLED TO INCLUDE THEM IN THE FFA IF ONLY FOR THE DOUBLE TAKE POTENTIAL EVERY SONG FEELS A LITTLE UNIQUE
I FUCKING LOVE THIS BAND SAW THEM AT LIVE EVIL SO GOOD
VINYL

TS
WHAT A FUCKING YEAR FOR TRADITION THIS SOUNDS PROMISING
U DEATHOFTHESUN U PROTOCHAUD ANY FANS OF ACARUS THE CHASM OR STONE MAGNUM TAKE NOTE THIS DROPS IN TWO WEEKS
FUCK I WANT TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE THING NOW AFTER THOSE TRACKS FUCK
THIS WAS A PRETTY COOL ALBUM AN INTERESTING MIX OF GENRES INFLUENCES TO ME IT SOUNDED LIKE POWER METAL SOME SYMPHONY X SO I GET THE PROG POWER BALLAD STUFF OF COURSE WITH SOME GROWLS SO I SEE THE MELO DEATH
JUST LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM THE OTHER DAY AND RECOMMENDED IT TO A CO WORKER IT'S NOT A HALF BAD ALBUM
THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION U DZORRILLA THIS IS BOMB
HAD NO IDEA THIS BAND WAS STILL ACTIVE

I USED TO LOVE THE SHIT OUT OF THESE GUYS NOT AS MUCH ANYMORE BUT I STILL GIVE EM THE OCCASIONAL LISTEN THEIR FINAL TWO THREE ALBUMS ARE PRETTY WOEFUL
KILLER

FOR THE RECORD THE BAND IS FROM FINLAND

FUCKING LOVE THIS BAND
WOW BLACK METAL NOW AIN'T THAT SOMETHING
WHAT A HIDDEN UNKNOWN GEM
I'M REALLY STARTING TO GET INTO EARLY EXTREME METAL LIKE THIS AND THE CELTIC FROST SONG I POSTED YESTERDAY CAN YOU GUYS RECOMMEND MORE BANDS LIKE THIS
I USED TO HANG AROUND AT JON Z'S RECORD SHOP IN NJ BACK WHEN BLACK METAL CAME OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A BOOTH IN A FLEA MARKET CONTAINING LOTS OF OTHER BOOTHS SELLING ALL SORTS OF CRAP HE HAD A TV SET UP IN THERE WITH THE VENOM FROM THE VERY DEPTHS OF HELL VIDEO WITCHING HOUR BLOODLUST RUNNING ON A CONTINUOUS LOOP IT WAS HILARIOUS SEEING SQUARES WALK BY LOOKING AWAY IN DISGUST AND TERROR VENOM DID SOME THERE TOO AND THEY WERE PRETTY COOL GUYS
STILL REMEMBER HEARING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME ON SOME COMPILATION CD LIKE A DECADE AGO AND IT COMPLETELY FUCKING BLOWING MY MIND
MY BAND COVERS THIS SONG TRIBUTE TO THE MASTERS

WATCH V
PURCHASED THIS ALBUM CAUSE OF DEATH AND HUMAN ONE WEEKEND BACK IN CHANGED MY LIFE
LIFE ENDS

FEELING DEATH


STILL THE BEST SEPULTURAL ALBUM IN MY EYES
MY SECOND FAVORITE SEPULTURAL ALBUM NOTHING BEATS SCHIZOPHRENIA FOR ME THOUGH WISH BENEATH THE REMAINS HAD A BIT MORE OF A RAWER PRODUCTION TO IT
IGOR WAS SUCH A BEAST SO UNDERRATED AS A DRUMMER
MAN I REALLY NEED TO LISTEN TO THESE GUYS MORE I'VE HIT ARISE A FEW TIMES AND THAT'S IT
SO MANY GREAT BREAKS ON THIS ALBUM IS JUST PHENOMENAL
MASTERPIECE FINAL SONG OF
MY FAVORITE SEPULTURAL ALBUM
INTERESTING CHOICE TO ACTUALLY ADD FFA TO A SEPULTURAL POST I SHOULD LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM AGAIN I HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD SCHIZOPHRENIA IN AWHILE MEANWHILE I'VE LISTENED TO MORBID VISIONS SHIPLOADS OF TIMES
THE WAY THIS BAND JUMPS THEIR TEMPO CHANGES NEVER FAILS TO EXCITE SEE ESP
IN AND JUST AFTER THE FIRST CHORUS NOT TO MENTION THE TRANSITION INTO THE BRIDGE
INTERESTING CHOICE TO SEE EXHORTER IN YOUR FFA
JUST BEFORE THE CAVALARAS BECAME WIMPS
ONE OF MY FAVORITES BY ONE OF MY FAVORITE USP BANDS
STRONG STUFF HOW WAS THEIR RELEASE
GOOD STUFF THIS PLACE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS BAND AND I AM GRATEFUL
SOME EARLY CHASTAIN IS ALWAYS GOOD
SO GLAD I SAW THEM LIVE WAS JUST THINKING THAT THEY'D NEVER REFORM THE DAY THEY DID AND SPEND A GOOD WHILE THINKING I'D NEVER CATCH THE REFORMATION

FUCK THEY'RE GOOD LIVE
GOT THIS ALBUM ON IN THE CAR ATM IT'S ABSOLUTELY KILLER
ONE OF MY FAVORITE DARKTHRONE SONGS BUT THERE'S NO WAY I WILL UNVOTE THIS POST
CAN'T BEAT THOSE VOCALS
LOVE THIS ALBUM
THIS ALBUM AND ABSOLUTION ARE BOTH BADASS RECORDS
AT FIRST I MISSED SOME OF THE SLUDGE FROM ABSOLUTION BUT HUNTED QUICKLY WON ME OVER SUCH A WELL CRAFTED MELODIC EPIC ALBUM
I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS SONG OVER AND OVER TODAY AWESOME CHOICE
I STILL HAVEN'T CONNECTED WITH THIS ONE THE WAY I DID WITH ABSOLUTION
I LIKE THIS ALBUM LOTS OF MELODY YES GOOD ALBUM
GREAT ALBUM
I ACTUALLY JUST DISCOVERED THESE GUYS EARLIER TODAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ON YEAR END LIST AND I ALREADY FUCKING LOVE THEM ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON SIMILAR BANDS
HOLY BALLS THIS BAND SOUNDS AWESOME
SEE THEM LIVE IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GUYS KNOW HOW TO PUT ON A SHOW
GOT THIS ALBUM ON CD FOR MY BIRTHDAY THIS IS MY FAVOURITE TRACK

I'VE BASICALLY BEEN LISTENING TO NOTHING BUT THIS ALBUM FOR THE PAST HOURS NOT NORMALLY INTO DOOM METAL BUT HUNTED IS FUCKING FANTASTIC IT'S NOT BORING OR DULL THE SONGS DON'T JUST PLAY ONE VERY SLOW CHORD FOR MINUTES AND CALL IT HEAVY ETC THE VOCALS ARE AMAZING THE SONGS ARE SO WELL WRITTEN AND JUST FLOW SO NATURALLY FROM ONE SECTION TO THE NEXT AND THE ARTWORK IS AMAZING
IF THIS ALBUM ISN'T TOP ON ARTY LIST THEN SOMETHING IF VERY WRONG
TRAD DOOM


THIS REMAINS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS OF NO QUESTION THAT IT'S GOING TO BE IN MY TOP KILLER PERFORMANCE TOO I'D LOVE TO CATCH THIS LIVE THANKS FOR POSTING
I HAVE MISSED HAVING JULIE CHRISTMAS AROUND SO MUCH CHECK OUT BOTH BATTLE OF MICE AND MADE OUT OF BABIES IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THEM YET
ANGST LEVELS REACHING KORN LEVELS I LIKE IT THOUGH
RAD
BRINGS ME BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL ALWAYS LIKED THIS SONG BUT FELT THE GROWLS WERE UNFITTING
BEEN HERDING OUT ON THIS BAND FOR YEARS AND THOUGH THEY'VE SHOWN STEADY IMPROVEMENT FROM RELEASE TO RELEASE THIS IS THEIR BEST RECORD BY A MILE IN MY OPINION
SIGH THAT STRAY EAST
TUPPERWARE DRUMS
FFA BAD DEATH METAL
OPENING SCENE SET THE STAGE NICELY WOW
THE LIVE VERSION OF THIS IS EVEN BETTER
CHAMPION ETERNAL CHAMPION
WHY DOES EVERYONE WRITE SUMMERLAND
MAN THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS OF ALL TIME IT'S JUST AMAZING THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE IS PERFECT THE VOCALS ARE SHREDDED AND THE DUALITY BETWEEN THE RIFFS AND CLEAN PASSAGES ARE ABSOLUTELY MASTERFUL WHAT I'D GIVE FOR ANOTHER KATATONIA RECORD LIKE THIS OR EVEN JUST AN ALBUM BLATANTLY RIPPING THIS OFFICIAL
THIS AORTA SOUNDS LIKE THE UNFORGIVEN A BIT
I'VE LIKED EVERY ALBUM HORRENDOUS HAS RELEASED SO FAR THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY IS MUCH FASTER THAN THE ONES THAT FOLLOWED AND I REALLY LOVE COMING BACK TO IT FOR A SPIN ONCE IN AWHILE
THERE ARE MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT HORRENDOUS BUT THE BEST MAY BE HOW QUICKLY THEY MAKE NEW MUSIC CAN'T WAIT FOR THEIR NEXT RELEASE SHOULD BE SOON I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S ALWAYS SO WELL WRITTEN AND SO WELL PRODUCED IN SUCH LITTLE TIME
I REALLY LOVE HORRENDOUS GOT THE CHANCE TO SEE THEM AND HANG OUT WITH THEM AFTER THEIR LAST SHOW IN MINNEAPOLIS THEY ARE SOME OF THE NICEST GUYS OUT THERE AND THEY DAMN SURE KNOW HOW TO MAKE SOME GREAT UNIQUE DEATH METAL CAN'T WAIT FOR THEIR NEXT ALBUM WHICH I'VE HEARD RUMORS THAT IT WILL BE VERY SOON STANDOUT PRODUCTION AND SONG WRITING
THIS ALBUM AND ESPECIALLY THIS SONG IS FANTASTIC SHOOTS FARTHER UP MY TOP OF LIST EVERY TIME I THROW IT ON AT THIS POINT I THINK ONLY VEATOR AND ETERNAL CHAMPION COULD CHALLENGE IT

ALSO IT'S AWESOME TO HEAR DIAMOND HEAD MAKE SUCH AWESOME MUSIC WITH TATLER BEING THE ONLY REMAINING ORIGINAL MEMBER
ANYONE SEEN EM LIVE WITH THIS SINGER THEY'RE PLAYING NEAR ME THIS SATURDAY AND I'M STILL DEBATING WHETHER TO GO
ALREADY TAKEN DOWN
U HIGHWAYCORSAIR ONE OF THE FEW I MANAGED TO FIND ANYTHING OF ONLINE
OBLIGATORY RIP

DEFINITELY STILL BUMMED ABOUT THEIR DEMISE BUT GLAD I WAS ABLE TO SEE THEM LIVE A FEW TIMES

STATIC TENSIONS REMAINS MY HIGH WATER MARK FOR THEM BUT I ENJOYED EACH OF THEIR RELEASES

HOPE LAURA AND PHILLIP CONTINUE MAKING MUSIC SOMEHOW
JUST SAW THESE GUYS LIVE WITH IRON REAGAN AND SKELETONWITCH A FEW WEEKS BACK DEFINITELY THE ODD ONE OUT OF THE NIGHT BUT IT WAS A GOOD CHANGE OF PACE FROM THE THRASHERS
SAW THEM LAST NIGHT THEY ARE SO GOOD LIVE DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS TOUR THEY ARE PLAYING TINY VENUES AND I'M GONNA GUESS THEY'LL BLOW UP SOON
LOVE THAT BAND THE SPEED AND TRASHINESS ARE GREAT BUT THE LYRICS AND THE VOCALS JUST CLICK EVERY BOX ON MY LIST
FINALLY I SAW THEM PERFORM THIS STUFF LIVE YEARS AGO BUT HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING SINCE I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK IT WAS BEING SHELVED
DOWNVOTING DEAD CONGREGATION
I WAS LISTENING TO THIS THE OTHER DAY LOVED IT I'LL PROBABLY ORDER THE PHYSICAL COPY SOMETIME SOON
THIS ONE JUST GOT HERE A HALF HOUR AGO WITH THEIR LATER REHEARSAL EP ALREADY GAVE IT ITS FIRST REAL LISTEN THROUGH WITH THE LYRICS OUT GONNA WAIT TIL TOMORROW TO GIVE THE OTHER EP A SPIN STILL WAITING ON PURIFYING CONSECRATED GROUND
LOVE THIS BAND SO MUCH
THIS BAND ALSO ONLY EVER DID TWO SONGS HERE IS THE OTHER
SCREW THE NAZI MODS
I'M REALLY TEMPTED I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I CAN MAKE IT ALL DAYS
MY ONLY CRITICISM TOWARDS THIS IS PARTS OF THE PRODUCTION THE BASS DRUM SOUNDS STUPID GUITARS ARE QUIET CAN'T HEAR THE BASS AND THE VOCALS ARE A BIT TOO LOUD I KIND OF LIKE HOW THE VOCALS KIND OF CLIP AT THE HIGH PARTS WHICH MOST WOULD CONSIDER A SIN

ANYWAYS OTHER THAN THAT THIS IS AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND VERY WELL CRAFTED PIECE OF BLACK METAL THE VOCALIST IS IN MY OPINION THE BEST VOCALIST I HAVE SEEN LIVE AND HE IS VERY GOOD ON THE RECORDING TOO

THE SLOWING OF THE TEMPO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG REALLY HELPS DIAL IN THE BRUTALITY THE HIGH PITCHED VOCALS ARE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I HAVE EVER HEARD AND THE INSTRUMENTATION SEEMS AUTHENTIC AND VERY SKILLED THE END OF THE SONG FEELS FAIRLY CHAOTIC AND THE ONLY CRITICISM OF THE SONGMAKING IS THAT THE SONG FEELS LIKE IT ENDS TOO SOON
FWIW ONLY LIKE FIFTEEN PEOPLE WERE THERE WHEN U DEATHOFTHESUN AND I SAW THEM LAST MONTH GREAT SHOW
BLAZING RIFFS ON THIS ALBUM
SAW THEM WITH OMEN BOTH WERE GREAT RIVERA LOOKED LIKE A CAPED LATINO BIO
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ALBUMS OF ALL TIME
PROPS TO A FELLOW ATLANTA METALHEAD
FUCKING HIT THAT SHOW THEY PLAYED A TRAGICALLY SHORT SET WHEN I SAW THEM BUT THEY WERE ON THE ENTIRE TIME
I LIKE THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ON ACCUSER
THE SONG TITLE MAKES THEM SEEM SO MUCH MORE SELF AWARE THAN THEY REALLY ARE
REALLY WANTED TO MAKE IT OUT TO THEIR UPCOMING EAST COAST TOUR JUST FOR AMIENSUS BUT SADLY THAT WON'T BE HAPPENING NEVER REALLY LISTENED TO AW I'VE HEARD MIXED REVIEWS BUT THIS SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD
IS IT JUST ME OR DO THE KICK DRUMS DROWN OUT A LOT OF THE SOUND IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS TRACK

THAT SAID I'M GLAD AW IS COMING INTO THEIR OWN MOST OF THEIR ALBUMS ARE PRETTY SOLID BUT LACKING IN PERSONALITY PROBABLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE FACT THAT THEY PUT OUT A DEATHCORE EP ONCE I TALKED TO KEN SORCEROUS ONLINE IN AND MENTIONED THAT THE AGARITA EP WOULD ALIENATE A LOT OF THE FANS WHO GOT INTO THEM VIA LEGEND HE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS THE WHOLE INTENTION BEHIND ITS RELEASE SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
THIS DEMO WASN'T ONLINE ANYWHERE EXCEPT IN FULL SO I UPLOADED IT WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE BAND
CHECK OUT THE FULL EP ON THEIR BANDCAMP VERY SOLID STUFF
DEFINITELY A BIT OF RAC INFLUENCE
U PROTOCHAUD U HIGHWAYCORSAIR

JUST DISCOVERED THIS BAND I GUESS THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE ANYONE HEARD OF THEM
RARE TRAD FROM THE MIDDLE EASTERN THIS AND THIS ARE THE ONLY OTHERS I'VE FOUNDATION
THANK YOU U PROTOCHAUD FOR TURNING ME ON TO THIS THIS MIGHT BE BETTER THAN DEMON BITCH
CIRCLE OF THE
HOOGH
I LIKE THE OBITUARY COVER IT WAS WHAT LED ME TO SEEK OUT CELTIC WAY BACK IN THE DAY
HOLY FUCK THESE GUYS ARE GOOD
I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF JAPETH COVERS BUT DO LIKE THEIR VERSION OF THE SONG
TOM G WARRIOR YELLED AT ME IN AN INTERVIEW ONCE IT WAS PRETTY RAD
OTHER SONG FROM THIS KILLER FRENCH SINGLE
PLEASE TELL ME YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL VERSION OF THIS
WASN'T A FAN THE FIRST FEW TIMES BUT NOW I LOVE IT
RIFFS ARE ALRIGHT BUT THOSE VOCALS ARE HORRENDOUS SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE THAT CAN'T SING TRYING TO DO FALSETTO IN THE SHOWER
FUCKING AWFUL BAND BOTH LIVE AND ON RECORD
SEEMS VERY INCHES OF
AXION ROOL
I WANT THEIR NEW ALBUM TO BE OUT NOW
JUST SAW THEM IN DALLAS AMAZING
SO MUCH BETTER THAN SWEVEN
METALCORE

THAT'S A BOLD MOVE COTTON
EXCELLENT WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS ONE
TURN IT UP
REALLY GLAD TO HAVE FINALLY SEEN RAZOR THIS YEAR AT CDF CRAZY SHOW
GREAT SOUNDING SONG I JUST WISH THEY PUT MORE VARIETY INTO THEIR RIFFS USING 2 RIFFS TOTAL IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE SONG WAS WHAT REALLY KILLED IT FOR ME

GREAT LYRICS AND STYLE THOUGH I SHOULD REALLY CHECK THEM OUT
SEEING THESE GUYS ON THURSDAY WITH EPIC AIKONA AND THE AGONIST NEVER SEEN ANY OF THEM BEFORE
QUITE AN UNDERRATED GEM YOU GOT HERE
WHO KNEW A HARPSICHORD COULD BE SO METAL
I LOVE THIS ALBUM IT'S EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITE OF THE YEAR

THE FOOL AND THE SONG MITRA ARE DEFINITELY MY TWO FAVORITE OFF THE ALBUM
COLD AS PERFECTION IS WELL PERFECTION
I HEARD THIS TRACK A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND IMMEDIATELY WANTED TO HEAR MORE LISTENED TO THE ALBUM I DIDN'T END UP LIKING THE REST OF THEIR MATERIAL ALL THAT MUCH BUT THIS TRACK IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGLES FOR
I ACTUALLY JUST REVIEWED THIS ALBUM FOR MY LAUNCH LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT HERE'S THE LINK I'D LOVE IT IF YOU GUYS CHECKED IT OUT
NOT SEEN THESE GUYS MYSELF BUT A MATE OF MINE WAS FUCKED AT DOWNLOAD FEST IN HIS TENT AND GOT UP ONCE HE HEARD THESE GUYS PLAYING FROM FUCKING QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY LIKE

PRETTY GOOD APPARENTLY EVEN FROM ABOUT A MILE OR SO AWAY

SOLID FUCKING TRACK
FLESHHOOD APOCALYPSE IS A BIT OF A STRANGE BAND TO ME SOMETIMES I AM JUST BORED BY THEM BUT SOMETIMES THEIR MUSIC JUST REALLY GETS ME AND IN THOSE MOMENTS THERE ARE FEW THINGS MORE INTENSE THAN THE COMBINATION OF AND AN ORCHESTRA
MY ONLY SYMPHONIC CONTENDER FOR TOP THIS YEAR HAVE TO LISTEN THROUGH THE ALBUM A FEW MORE TIMES THOUGH
I ALSO SAW THEM ON TOUR WITH AIKONA AND THE AGONIST EPIC SKIPPED MY CITY SADLY THEY'D BE THE BAND I'D LIKE MOST IS SAY AIKONA WAS MY FAVORITE OF THE I WAS KIND OF DISAPPOINTED IN FLESHHOOD I LISTENED TO THE ALBUM A FEW TIMES IN ADVANCE TO PREPARE AND A COUPLE SONGS WERE FUN BUT OVERALL I THOUGHT THEY WERE KIND OF MEDIOCRE THE JUST FELT BORING TO ME DIDN'T SEEM VERY TECHNICAL AND THE SINGER STARTED SAYING SOME ADOLESCENT GOTHIC RAMBLING ABOUT DEATH BEING SO TRUE BLAH BLAH BLAH THE CROWD WAS SUPER INTO IT THOUGH HAD SOME FUN IN THE MOSH PIT
AAA FLESHHOOD APOCALYPSE WILL AND MUST BE BLACKLISTED
READING THESE COMMENTS I WAS LIKE WHY IS AIKONA TOURING WITH THESE BANDS

THEN I REALIZED YOU DIDN'T MEAN THE REAL AIKONA

LOVE ENT BUT THIS MIGHT GET MORE TRACTION ON R CRUSTPUNK OR EVEN JUST R PUNK
SO I LOVE SECRET CHIEFS AND LOVE THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE SURF RIDDEN APOCALYPTIC SONGS LIKE BARAKIEL AND EXODUS BUT I THINK THEIR METAL IS WEAK ON ITS OWN AND IS ONLY SEEN AS AMAZING BECAUSE THEY FLIP TO SUCH EXTREME STYLES
LOVE THESE GUYS
REALLY ENJOYED THIS NEW ALBUM ALMOST TOP WORTHY BUT MY LIST IS TOO STUFFED AS IT IS
THESE GUYS ARE LIKE THE AC DC OF ATMOBLACK AND I MEAN THAT IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE THESE ALBUMS IS KILLER BUT I JUST WANT MORE IF IT HAD BEEN AS LONG AS THE DIVINATION OF ANTIQUITY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MY FAVORITE WINTERFYLLETH RECORD BUT IT JUST FEELS SO SHORT THAT ALVER COVER IS KILLERRRR THOUGH
FOAH I'M BLOWN AWAY DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD RELEASED THIS AND IT IS SICK THANKS
I STAND BY MY STATEMENT
I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT FREE METAL THREAD IT WOULD NEED A BROADER TITLE BUT I TOTALLY AGREE WE'RE OVERDUE FOR A NEW ONE

AS FOR THIS SPECIFIC ALBUM I AM NOT A FAN OF LIVE TRACKS AT ALL BUT THE FIRST TRACK IS PRETTY GOOD THE VOCALS ARE IMPRESSIVE
OOF THAT ALBUM ART
I'M REALLY ENJOYING THIS THANKS FOR POSTING IT
SEXUAL METAL HOLOCAUST WILL CRUSH POSER GAY
I WAS GONNA POST THIS A COUPLE DAYS AGO LOL
BLACK METAL
ARGHOSLENT AND EDGE OF SANITY THERE'S TWO BANDS WITH A LOT IN COMMON

ON THE PROWL FOR MORE EARLY TECH MELODIC DEATH WITH CLEAR TRADITIONAL METAL INFLUENCE ANYONE HAVE ANYTHING FOR ME
YOU POSTED THESE GUYS BEFORE RIGHT I RECALLED REALLY LIKING THEM BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND ANYWHERE TO DOWNLOAD THE ALBUM
DECIDED TO REVISIT THIS ON YOUR RECOMMENDATION U DZORRILLA AND I'M GLAD I AM FUCKING KILLER
THEY ARE WORKING ON THEIR THIRD ALBUM AND I AM DEFINITELY NOT A PATIENT GUY

GREAT STUFF REMINDS ME OF VERY OLD EPIC MANPOWER SONGS BUT WITH A VERY DENSE ATMOSPHERE LOVE IT
DEFINITELY ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS FROM THE LAST YEARS
FIRST TIME HEARING THIS SINCE GETTING INTO HEAVY POWER STUFF GREAT VOCALS AND EPIC ATMOSPHERE
ONE OF THE BEST EPIC METAL ALBUMS OF RECENT TIMES RELEASED BY THE MOST PRETENTIOUS BAND OF RECENT TIMES

EVERY GIG IS AN ANNIHILATION WITH A PAGE MANIFESTO ABOUT HOW EPIC IT WILL BE THEN THEY TURN UP IN THEIR JEANS STAND ENTIRELY STILL AND PLAY FOR LESS THAN AN HOUR WITH THE SINGER HITTING MAYBE OF THE RIGHT NOTES

NOT TO MENTION THEY SPENT YEARS WRITING THIS RECORD WHEN OF IT IS RECYCLED AND REARRANGED MANPOWER SOLSTICE WHILE HEAVEN WEPT RIFFS
WOW WHAT A GREAT SONG CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND MORE BANDS LIKE THIS BESIDES MANPOWER WHO I'M FAMILIAR WITH AND WHO ATLANTEAN CODEX SEEMS TO TAKE A STRONG INFLUENCE FROM
I ADORE THIS BAND
I CAN'T NOT UNVOTE INCANTATION SUCH AN AMAZING BAND ONWARD TO GOLGOTHA IS STILL MY FAVE THO
FAT ASS RIFFS
STOKED TO SEE THEM AGAIN IN THREE WEEKS LAST TIME MCENTEE WAS OUT SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO A PROPER INCANTATION SHOW THIS TIME
MAUDLIN OF THE WELL ALSO THE LEAD PREVIOUS BAND

WATCH V QSUHCKUMQEG

I THINK THIS CLIP PUTS INTO VIDEO FORM WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO LISTEN TO XASTHUR THE MUSIC ISN'T ANYTHING SPECIAL EVEN IN TERMS BUT THE VIDEO IS DEFINITELY GREAT

SO IF ANYONE IS FINISHING UP EBBMAN LISTEN TO A XASTHUR RECORD IT MIGHT CHANGE THE WAY YOU LISTEN TO BLACK METAL
MASTERPIECE
HEY GUYS AND GIRLS IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE A LOT TO SAY IN REACTION TO THIS BUT I HAD TO CLEAN THINGS UP SINCE THINGS GOT HEATED AND NOW THERE IS A BROKEN LAMP WE ARE A MUSIC RELATED SUB BUT POLITICS DO COME UP FROM TIME TO TIME BUT THERE ARE BETTER PLACES TO HAVE LONG FORM DISCUSSIONS ON IDEOLOGY

TO SOME OF THE NEWER PEOPLE IN HERE WE HAVE A GENERAL METAL DISCUSSION THREAD ON TUESDAYS AND AN OFF TOPIC THREAD ON THURSDAYS MORE POLITICAL QUESTIONS AND DEBATES CAN BE HAD GENERAL ETTIEQUTE STILL APPLIES TO RESPONSES THOUGH AND INCITING VIOLENCE AGAINST ANY ONE GROUP DESPITE WHICH SIDE IT IS COMING FROM IS ALWAYS PROHIBITED ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS CAN ADDRESSED IN FUTURE THREADS OR EVEN HERE

I ORIGINALLY LOCKED THIS THREAD BUT DECIDED TO LEAVE IT GO SINCE I NEVER HAVE TO LOCK THREADS DO NOT LET ME DOWN I BELIEVE IN YOU AND THAT THIS SUB IS BETTER THAN OTHERS FOR HAVING MEASURED DISCUSSIONS
THIS WHOLE MESS IS A GIANT CLUSTERFUCK AND MY FACEBOOK IS LIGHTING UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE
CAN I JUST SAY THAT IT'S WEIRD THAT THERE IS S LARGE NORTH AMERICAN BLACK METAL FESTIVAL AND THIS IS THE FIRST I'M HEARING ABOUT IT
THEY ARE THE ONES THREATENING VIOLENCE STUPIDITY
SO MANY COMMENTS ON THIS SHIT NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT THE FUCK FASCISM IS

FASCISM IS A DISTINCT SET OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES NOT JUST A GENERALIZED TERM FOR MILITANT AUTHORITARIANISM YOU CAN BE LEFTIST AND AUTHORITARIAN STALINIST OR LEFTIST AND LIBERTARIAN CLASSICAL ANARCHIST JUST LIKE YOU CAN BE FAR RIGHT AND AUTHORITARIAN FASCISM NAZISM OR FAR RIGHT AND LIBERTARIAN ASCAP OR AN ENDLESS MIX OF THESE IN BETWEEN
AS ONE GUY TOLD ME WHEN I WAS EXPLAINING TO A PASSERBY WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN FRONT OF THE VENUE WITH THE POLICE CORDONING OFF THE COMMUNISTS AND THE VENUE NO THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAY IT IS IT'S A FESTIVAL A FESTIVAL OSSUAIRE ANGUS MAYHEMIC TRUTH ADA FORTERESSE AGOROTH GRAPELAND NOT TO MENTION BANDS AGLA CULT OF FIRE MORRIGAN BLAZE OF PERDITION MONARQUE MOONREICH ANTIQUE LÉPREUX BLACKSCORN

THERE WAS NOT A NAZI BANNER TO BE SEEN NOBODY IN WHITE HOODS NO SALUTE JUST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE FUN AND LISTEN TO THEIR MUSIC PEOPLE WHO WROTE ON A BM LOVERS FB PAGE BEFOREHAND LISTEN GUYS I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SOME COMMUNISTS SHITFUCKERS BUT CAN WE STAY CALM AND JUST GO PEACEFULLY ENJOY BM

IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME BLACK BLOC FUCKERS EVERYWHERE IN MONTREAL WHO WEAR A SCARF TO COVER THEIR GUILTY FACES POLICING THOUGHTS LIKE THE TRUE TOTALITARIANS THEY ARE AND JUST BLOCKING EVERYTHING FROM CLASSES TO ROADS TO SHOWS DESTROYING A UNIVERSITY BLOCKADING COLLEGES ETC THEY WERE ODD FUCKERS WITH NOTHING TO DO ON A SATURDAY NIGHT NO LIFE PURPOSE OTHER THAN CREATING MORE SHIT LIKE THEY'VE DONE BEFORE THEM AGAINST SOMETHING PEACEFUL PEOPLE WHO LOVE BM APPARENTLY THEY CALLED IN A BOMB THREAT BECAUSE THEIR SORRY ASSES COULD NOT HAVE STOPPED THE SHOW AGAINST HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO WAITED IN LINE FOR 2 HOURS IN THE COLD TO MAKE SURE THEY WOULD LOVE THE HECK OUT OF GRAPELAND AND ALL BANDS THERE ONCE THE DOORS WOULD OPEN THEY HAD TO LIE AND MAKE EMPTY THREATS AFTER THE BATACLAN I'M PRETTY SURE THÉÂTRE PLAZA AND SEPULCHRAL DID NOT HAVE A CHOICE TO CANCEL

I FOR ONE DON'T WANT A REFUND JUST OUT OF SUPPORT TO THE AMAZING SHOWS SEPULCHRAL PUTS OUT MONTH AFTER MONTH HERE IN MONTREAL AND EVERY YEAR FOR LA MESSE DES MORTS I'M FUCKING BUYING ALL THE FRICKING SHIRTS TOO
IF LINES ARE TO BE DRAWN IT'S OBVIOUS ENOUGH TO ME WHICH SIDE I WOULD STAND ON ONE HAS POLITICAL VIEWS I DON'T AGREE WITH THE OTHER SHUTS DOWN CONCERTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T AGREE WITH THEM NOW WHO HAS THE BETTER MUSIC
I'M A PRETTY LEFT WING GUY MYSELF BUT THIS REALLY ISN'T THE WAY TO GO ABOUT DOING THINGS THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO PUT ON LIVE SHOWS FASCIST OR NOT
WHAT'S FUCKED UP IS THAT I FLEW OUT THERE FROM TENNESSEE ONLY FOR IT TO GET CANCELED IT WAS A HUGE CLUSTERFUCK BUT IT HAD TO BE PUT TO AN END HAD AN ABSOLUTE BLAST ON FRIDAY NIGHT AT LEAST FUCKING ANATIFA I WAS EXPECTING THIS TO HAPPEN LAST YEAR OR SO BACK IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD ATAKE PLAY THOSE FOOLS CAME IN AND PEPPERSPRAYED EVERYONE THE REASONING IS UNKNOWN STOMP NAZIS ALL YOU WANT BUT PLEASE HAVE A SLIVER OF RESPECT FOR OTHERS

I DON'T FLY HOME UNTIL TOMORROW IF ANYONE WANTS TO GRAB SOME BEERS TONIGHT MADE THE TRIP SOLO
WHO THERE IS AN AVOWED FASCIST

2 IF THERE ARE FASCISTS IS CENSORING THEM UNDER THREAT OF VIOLENCE THE BEST APPROACH
AH I HATE IT WHEN EXTREMISTS GET THEIR WAY DAMN SHAME
REMOVED

I HOPE THIS WILL ONLY STRENGTHEN RESOLVE TO PLAY MORE LIVE SHOWS




MAN READING THAT FACEBOOK PAGE IS PILEUP OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH ANATIFA HAS TO KNOW THAT WHAT THEY DO CAN BE SEEN A TYRANNICAL AND FASCIST RIGHT RIGHT I MEAN WHY NOT JUST MAKE BANDS AND BE THE COOLER DRAW RATHER THAN SHIT ON SOMEONE TIME

2 PLACEBO MAINSTREAM BUT MARVELLOUS

WENT TO TWO

BEHEMOTH AGLA AND SECRETS OF THE MOON AND WAS AWESOME
ALSO SAW WORMED AND IT WAS ALMOST AS GOOD
I JUST SAW BLACK SABBATH LIVE IN AUGUST THAT WAS THE MOST AMAZING AWESOME LIVE CONCERT I'VE SEEN IN YEARS
MY FAVORITES THIS YEAR WERE NILE ON THE SUMMER SLAUGHTER AMON MARTH IN APRIL AND SABATON LAST MONTH
SEEING ONE OF DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN'S FINAL SHOWS IN BERKELEY LAST MONTH WAS ABSOLUTELY MIND-BLOWING SO MUCH ENERGY AND LOVE FOR THE FANS IT REMINDED ME HOW BEAUTIFUL THEIR SONGS CAN BE
SOB I ONLY WENT TO ONE CONCERT THIS YEAR SOB IT WAS THE WIFE'S TURN TO PICK SO WE SAW DIXIE CHICKS SOB ACTUALLY I ENJOYED THE SHOW THEY WERE FILMING FOR A DVD AND THE GIRLS DID A GREAT JOB
I SAW THE KELVINS THIS AUGUST IN A SMALL VENUE THAT WAS PRETTY RAD
HANDS DOWN SEEING THE MISFITS IN CHICAGO BAND SOUNDED TIGHTER THAN EVER AND AFTER BEING A FAN SINCE IT WAS SICK TO HEAR THE PRE STUFF PLAYED ON TIME FOR THE FIRST TIME
I REALLY LIKED THIS ALBUM WAS MY FIRST TIME GIVING THESE GUYS A CHANCE AND HOLLY SHIT I'VE BEEN MISSING OUT ABOUT TO GET THE REST OF THEIR DISCOGRAPHY
THERE REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH MESOAMERICAN METAL WHICH KIND OF SURPRISES ME CONSIDERING THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE AZTECS AND THE INCAS IS MUCH MORE STEEPED IN DEATH AND BLOOD SACRIFICE THAN NORTHERN EUROPEAN MYTHOLOGY
THE ATMOSPHERE IS SO THICK IN THIS SONG THE MELODY IN THE FIRST MINUTE OR SO IS SO SINISTER AND BEAUTIFUL AT THE SAME TIME AWESOME ALBUM
ONE OF THE MORE INSANE LIVE BANDS I'VE SEEN WOULD LOVE A NEW ALBUM FROM THEM
SAW THEM LAST SUMMER UNFORTUNATELY SANS BASS PLAYER BUZ U SOUTH AND STUFF AND I GOTTA SAY SINGING IS EVEN MORE KILLER LIVE THIS WHOLE BAND TOTALLY RIPS
MY BAND AND I DID THE BACK UP CROWD CHANTS FOR THIS TUNE

SOURCE
GOTTA BE HONEST I CAN'T GET INTO THESE GUYS I'VE PLAYED A SHOW WITH THEM AND THEY PUT ON A GREAT PERFORMANCE BUT I'M LIKE THE ONLY ONE OF MY GROUP OF METALHEAD FRIENDS THAT DOESN'T LIKE THESE GUYS THE SONG DOES NOTHING FOR ME AND SADLY I HAVE YET TO HEAR A SONG BY THIS BAND THAT GRABS ME AT ALL I ALSO CAN'T STAND THE GROWLING BUT I FIND IT'S TRICKY TO INTEGRATE GROWLING INTO POWER METAL IN A WAY THAT ISN'T RIDICULOUS

I'M ALSO GLAD I SAW SOMEONE ELSE MENTION THE PRODUCTION I CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE A WELL-DONE DEMO
DRUMS SOUND LIKE AN ELECTRIC KIT BEING PLAYED AND SOUND FROM SAMPLES GUITARS SOUND BORING AND STERILE

THE SONG STRUCTURE IS A MESS NOTHING REALLY DEVELOPS AND THE TRANSITIONS ARE CHAOTIC IT'S SIMPLE MUSIC THAT IS HARD TO FOLLOW

THE RASP VOCAL IN THE END IS PRETTY CHEEKY BUT FOR ME IT'S THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS SONG


THESE GUYS RULE SO HARD
TONIGHT THEY DO INDEED RIDE TONIGHT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS EVENING
ONE OF THE FEW POWER METAL BANDS THAT I DO LIKE
BRITTNEY HAS THE BEST CLEANS IN METAL TODAY
ALRIGHT GUYS AND GIRLS LET US NOT DO ANYTHING HASTY PUT THOSE PINS BACK IN THE GRENADES
THIS SONG IS KIND OF A PIECE OF SHIT
GIVES ME A FEEL SOUNDS PRETTY AWESOME TO BE HONEST I WILL CHECK OUT A BIT MORE OF THEIR STUFF AND IF THEY IMPROVISE IN THEIR MUSIC INSTEAD OF STICKING TO THE NORM I'LL CHECK THEM OUT

SORRY ABOUT THE MENTAL BREAKDOWN A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO I WAS THAT CLOSE TO GOING BARASHIT INSANE AGAIN

READER OF WORDS

NINJA EDITS SPELLING
I'M GONNA START LISTENING TO THESE GUYS JUST TO SPITE ANATIFA
YESTERDAY I MISSED A PLANE AND I SUDDENLY HAVE THE WHOLE OF TODAY TO BURN I'M STUCK IN A SURFER TOWN FULL OF BEACH BUMS AND BACKPACKERS AND ALL I REALLY WANNA DO IS LISTEN TO BLASPHEMY
I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW THE BAND BUT I KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THEM TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR SHTICK BUT I GOTTA ASK WHATS WITH THE SUNGLASSES
IS THAT THE HEAVY WEAPONS GUY FROM TEAM FORTRESS 2
I REALLY DON'T LIKE GRINDCORE BUT I REALLY LIKE THIS ALBUM
THIS REALLY IS A COOL DRUM TRACK THO
TROJAN WHORE IS MY FAVORITE TRACK ON THIS ALBUM
DEM ARPEGGIOS
TROYQUAN SENT ME HERE
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CATCH THESE GUYS AT A LITTLE UNITARIAN CHURCH A YEAR OR TWO AGO AND DIDN'T TAKE IT I'M STILL KICKING MYSELF OVER THAT ONE SCOTT HULL IS A BEAST

WTF SLEEP PIG DESTROYER WITHERED KHEMMIS FALLS OF AUROUS CEMETERY PISS IN WHAT A LINEUP
I HAD THE DRUM INTRO TO JUNKYARD GOD AS MY WAKEUP ALARM FOR A WHILE TO GET ME PUMPED UP FOR THE DAY
I SMOKED SALVIA LISTENING TO THIS SONG ONE TIME IT WAS CRAZY
HEY HEY HEY DON'T FORGET THE REMASTERIES REISSUE OF THIS BEAUTY

YOUTUBE FOR THE WIN
NICE I ENJOYED THAT ANCIENT SPIRIT TAPE SO WILL BE SURE TO LISTEN
LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR SPLIT WITH STOLZBLUT NOT MANY BANDS PLAY THIS STYLE HERE IN THE MIDWEST
I REALLY WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THESE GUYS WHEN I WAS GETTING INTO BLACK METAL
ISN'T THERE A TAG FOR ATMOSPHERIC BLACK

NOT THAT IT MATTERS FOR CASUAL BROWSING BUT IT HELPS THOSE WHO FILTER BY GENRE
AWESOME SONG REMINDS ME OF WINTERSUN FIRST THEN SLOWLY FADES TO SOMETHING LIKE EDGE OF SANITY THEN LATER GOES FULL ON GRIND CORE DEATH METAL SO AWESOME WISH I KNEW ABOUT THESE GUYS A COUPLE MONTHS AGO LIKE U DUDELISHISMUSIC
CONTINUING WITH MY WINTER THEME
LAO WINTER
REAL SHAME THAT
CYSTEIN BRUN CONTINUES WITH THIS FUCKING AWFUL BAND WHEN HE WAS SO GREAT IN MOLESTED THEN AGAIN NOBODY IN MOLESTED WENT ON TO MAKE ANY GOOD MUSIC AFTERWARDS AS FAR AS I KNOW
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT LOVES THE INTROS TO THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM
FANTASTIC ALBUM JUST ORDERED A WHITE VINYL COPY FROM HELLS HEADBANGERS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY DAD
I SAW THEM LIVE TWO TIMES A WEEK APART AND I COULD SWEAR THEY DIDN'T CHANGE THEIR CLOTHES NOT EVEN THE BAND SHIRTS THEY WERE WEARING
HOLY FUCK THIS RULES
BERI HAS SUCH A GREAT VOICE
MAN THIS IS DEFINITELY IN MY TOP OF THE YEAR I'M NOT SURE IT LIVED UP TO STORM BUT REGARDLESS OF THAT IT'S A GREAT RELEASE FEELS LIKE IT'S TAKING FOREVER FOR THE LP TO SHOW UP IN THE MAIL
THAT NEW SCORCHED ALBUM IS FUCKING FANTASTIC IT'S LIKE VASTUS WITH SHORTER SONGS AND HORROR SPLATTER THEMES THROUGHOUT TURNING EVERYONE OFF BUT WITH MUSIC THAT STRONG I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD MATTER
THIS POST WAS INCREDIBLE I THANK YOU FOR RELOADING MY PONTIFY WITH GREAT ALBUMS
MY PICK OF THE WEEK WOULD BE THE NEW MARTYRDÖD ALBUM YES IT'S A CRUST ALBUM BUT THOSE GUITAR LINES ARE STRAIGHT OUT OF THE NWOBHM PLAYBOOK AWESOME RECORD
HOLY SHIT THE RIFF ON THE ENTRANCED BY THE WOLFSHOOK IS MILD-BLOWING I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVENT HEARD OF THEM BEFORE
WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK OF THE NEW BLAZER ALBUM MY THOUGHTS ARE IN MY REVIEW HERE
THANKS FOR DOING THIS OP
I'D MAKE LOVE TO YOUR POST JUST FOR MENTIONING ROOT ROOT IS LOVE ROOT IS LIFE BIG BOSS IS BOSS
SERIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE ANY PASSING INTEREST IN EPIC BLACK HEAVY METAL THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOREVER GIVE THEM A TRY THE FIRST ALBUM IS IN THE SAME LINE AS STUFF LIKE MASTER'S HAMMER BUT IT GOES COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY AFTER THAT MY AV IS THE BOOK BUT KARGERAS AND ESPECIALLY THE TEMPLE IN THE UNDERWORLD ARE VERY CLOSE FAVORITES
NEW ROOT OH MY
I CHECKOUT YOUR PONTIFY PLAYLIST EACH SATURDAY FOR THE NEW ADDITIONS REALLY NICE WORK

CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT DID I SEE YOUR NAME IN AN INTERVIEW WITH MAX CAVALERO IN A DUTCH NEWSPAPER
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS
I'M PRETTY SURE I SAY THIS EVERY WEEK BUT I'M JUST GONNA KEEP SAYING IT THESE WRITE UPS ARE AMAZING AND ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR ME EVERY WEEK NOW BOLDER AND HOUR OF PENANCE HAVE ME AT FULL MAST RIGHT NOW
REALLY ENJOYING THIS MUSIC UP TILL A FEW DAYS AGO MY MUSIC SEARCHING WAS LIMITED MAINLY TO THE SIMILAR BANDS SECTION ON METALPEDIA SO NOW THAT I'M BROWSING THE REDDIN I'M FINDING LOTS OF COOL BANDS THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE

MOST ARE FROM THE EARLY AND BECAUSE I WAS VERY YOUNG AT THE TIME THEY NEVER CROSSED MY RADAR

ANYWAY GREAT BAND GREAT SONG WORTH THE LISTEN ENTIRELY
THESE GUYS HAVE TWO SONGS COMING OUT IN EARLY JANUARY THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING
FUCK YEAH ONE OF THE VERY FEW SLAM BANDS I ENJOY
KIND OF IN THE SAME VEIN I GUESS DID YOU LISTEN TO THE NEW MARTYRDOM I JUST SAW IT COME UP ON R CRUSTPUNK AND NOW I HAVE ANOTHER BANDS DISCOGRAPHY TO WORK MY WAY THROUGH
THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT
AWESOME MY ONLY ISSUE IS WITH THE DRUMS THEY COULD BE A LITTLE MORE AUDIBLE IMO YOU FINS THIS JUST SURFING THROUGH YOUTUBE OR SOME OTHER WAY
DAMMIT THESE GUYS ARE GOOD GONNA HAVE TO GO GET SOME OF THIS SHIT
CAN WE NOT DO THIS FOR ONCE
DELETED
BLACK DEATH

I THINK YOU MAY NEED TO WORK ON THAT GENRE
AS MUCH AS I LOVE INQUISITION I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GETTING POSTED TOO MUCH RECENTLY THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS WEEK ALONE
I NEVER REALLY GOT INTO INQUISITION BUT I LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH
MAKE WAY
I LIKE CDS THEY'RE STILL RELEVANT TO ME AND A LOT OF THE SCENE
JUST THROW EVERYONE A CURVE AND RELEASE IT EXCLUSIVELY ON LASERDISK
IF I WERE YOU I'D RELEASE IT ON WHATEVER FORMAT YOU NORMALLY BUY AS A FAN OF WHATEVER GENRE IT IS YOUR BAND IS THE MOST RELEVANT FORMAT KINDA VARIES BY SUBGENRE
PERSONALLY I BUY ALL THE ALBUMS I LOVE ON CD SOME OF US STILL HAVE CARS WHERE THAT'S THE ONLY LISTENING OPTION AND HAVING IT ON CD MEANS I CAN ADD IT TO MY DIGITAL COLLECTION BEFORE IT TAKES ITS PLACE IN MY MASSIVE CD BINDER I BUY VINYL TOO WHEN I CAN FIND IT FOR CHEAP BECAUSE IT'S FUN TO COLLECT BUT IF I HAD TO CHOOSE A PREFERED FORMAT IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE CD
THIS DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU GO AND HOW MUCH YOU ARE PUTTING IN DISCMAKERS USUALLY HAS A MINIMUM ORDER OF WHICH IS A SHIT TON OF CDS THAT IS A LOT OF CDS LEFT OVER BUT YOU NEED SOME FOR MERCH AND PROMOTION FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN VINYL IS MORE OF A MONEY SINK THAN CDS SINCE THE COST PER UNIT RATIO IS SO MUCH HIGHER IF YOU CAN FIND A PLACE THAT DOESN'T DO A LARGE RUN LIKE VINYLS IT WOULD PROBABLY BE WORTH IT

STOCK YOUR ALBUM LIKE YOU WOULD SHIRTS YOU WOULDN'T ORDER SHIRTS RIGHT UNLESS YOU WERE CERTAIN YOU COULD SELL ALL OF THEM HAVE YOUR ALBUM FOR PURCHASE ON BANDCAMP FIRST AND HAVE CDS CASSETTES AND MAYBE A LIMITED RUN OF VINYL FOR YOUR SHOWS PEOPLE DO NOT BUY CDS LIKE THEY USED TO BUT THEY STILL DO
CDS ARE ABSOLUTELY STILL RELEVANT AND WILL BRING IN A LOT OF REVENUE YOUR BAND MATE IS PROJECTING HIS PERSONAL BELIEFS TO THAT OF SOCIETY EVER SEE A BAND WITH A FLASH DRIVE ALBUM OR A DOWNLOAD CARD ALBUM THAT'S WHAT'S KINDA LAUGHED AT THESE DAYS TAKE IT FROM ME ONE ALBUM RELEASE WE HAD DOWNLOAD CARDS DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS IT WAS NOT GOOD

VINYL IS REALLY GREAT TO HAVE BUT SUPER EXPENSIVE TO GET DONE IT'S EASY TO GET INTO THE UNIT COST SO KEEP THAT IN MIND IF YOU DON'T THINK YOUR FANS WILL PAY FOR A VINYL DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
I NOTICE THAT CASSETTES ARE SOMEHOW NOT IN CONTENTION AT ALL
ARE STILL RELEVANT BUT YOU NEED GOOD ARTWORK TO DRAW ATTENTION START WITH SEE HOW FAST THEY SELL THEN GO FROM THERE
I STILL BUY CDS WHENEVER I CAN AND IT'S PROBABLY MY PREFERRED WAY OF BUYING MUSIC I ALSO BUY DIGITAL BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY DAMN CONVENIENT BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE HOLDING A BRAND NEW CD IN YOUR HANDS LOOKING AT THE ARTWORK FLIPPING THROUGH THE BOOKLET ETC
YOU COULD ALWAYS DO A PRESS OF VINYL RECORDS TO SEE HOW IT SELLS IF IT SELLS FAIRLY QUICKLY THERE'S DEMAND FOR MORE COPIES THEN PRINT MORE

THAT'S JUST MY OPINION THOUGH
I DON'T BUY HAVEN'T FOR AGES HAVE NO PLANS TO START I'M ALL ABOUT VINYL A SUCKER FOR IT ADDICTED CASSETTES ARE COOL I'VE SEEN MORE AND MORE OFTEN LATELY WHICH YOU GUYS SHOULD CONSIDER IMHO

INCLUDE A DOWNLOAD CODE WITH THE VINYL FOR EXTRA POINTS
JUST MY 2 CENTS BUT I HAVEN'T BOUGHT A CD IN LIKE YEARS I'M A DIGITAL RELEASE FAN
I THINK ARE OK BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY I PREFER TO GET A VINYL OR CASSETTE IF I AM IN NEED OF SOMETHING ON CD FOR MY CAR OR ANYTHING I CAN TAKE ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED FORMATS RIP IT TO MY COMPUTER AND BURN A CD I CAN'T RIP A CD TO A VINYL

JUST TO CLARIFY I'M NOT ADVOCATING ILLEGAL SHARING I ONLY RIP A CD FOR MYSELF AND MY OWN PERSONAL USE AFTER I'VE ALREADY PURCHASED AN ALBUM FROM A BAND

DIGITAL IS ALWAYS A GOOD CHOICE BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP AND PORTABLE I'M NOT TOO KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE LOGISTICS BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN ALWAYS RELEASE DIGITAL ALONG WITH ANYTHING ELSE
I THINK ONE FACTOR TO CONSIDER IS LOCAL ANABASE AND JUST HOW BIG YOU ARE IN GENERAL I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T BUY A CD OR A VINYL FOR THAT MATTER IF THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE NAME OF THE BAND

SINCE IT'S YOUR THIRD ALBUM THOUGH I WOULD IMAGINE YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANABASE I'D SAY GO FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF AND SEE HOW IT GOES IF THE PREORDER DON'T DO WELL YOU CAN THEN SELL THE AS MERCH AT SHOWS WITHOUT MUCH FAIL
DIGITAL RELEASE IS PROBABLY YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ONE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOME PHYSICAL PRODUCTS IF YOU DO GIGS

AND CDS ARE DEFINITELY RELEVANT JUST DO SOME PROMO AND TRY TO GET A FRIENDLY DISTRIBUTOR
THIS WOULD REALLY DEPEND ON YOUR SCENE SOME PLACES CDS WILL SELL FINE OTHERS THEY WON'T AT ALL

SOME PLACES STILL HAVE HUGE TAPE MARKETS IT ALL VARIES ON REGION
I HAVEN'T BOUGHT A CD IN LITERALLY FOREVER I'M CONSIDERING BUYING A VINYL COPY OF COMA ECLIPTIC SO I CAN HAVE IT AND EVENTUALLY ENJOY THE PURITY ON A RECORD PLAYER BUT MOST BANDS ARE RELEASING ON PONTIFY RIGHT NOW AND IT WORKS GREAT
CDS ARE MY DEFAULT PURCHASE CHOICE IF IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE ON VINYL OR I REALLY LIKE IT THEN I'LL GO FOR VINYL I'LL BUY CASSETTES IF IT'S ONLY AVAILABLE ON CASSETTE
I ONLY BUY PHYSICAL MEDIA ON VINYL BUT I'M A REALLY MINOR EDGE CASE I JUST DON'T REALLY DIG CDS DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME TO ME BIG DEAL FOR ME WITH WAX THOUGH IS I NEED SOME WAY TO GET IT DIGITALLY AS WELL SO EITHER A BANDCAMP DL INCLUDED OR SOME OTHER METHOD
I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE SCALE IT SHOULDNT BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO PRESS A SMALL NUMBER TO SELL AT RELEASE SHOWS SOME TO SELL ONLINE AND SOME TO SEND OUT TO PRESS IF YOU NEED LARGER NUMBERS ID SAY IT AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES RELEVANT


DO YOU RELEASE THROUGH A LABEL THEY MUST HAVE SALES NUMBERS LET CAPITALISM DECIDE


OH AND FOR ME PERSONALLY I GREW UP BUYING AND I'VE GOT ROOMS FULL OF EM BUT I NEVER EVER BUY THEM AGAIN I DO BUY VINYL BUT ONLY IF I REALLY LIKE IT STILL TOO MUCH THE REST OF MY MUSIC MONEY GOES TO PONTIFY AND BANDCAMP
CDS ARE ALL I LISTEN TO THOUGH I DO STILL COLLECT SELECT LPS I COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT DIGITAL IF I NEED AN OF SOMETHING I JUST MAKE IT
MY PREFERRED FORMAT IS CDS HOWEVER THE ONLY METAL SHOP IN MY CITY SELLS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY VINYL SO I DO STOP BUY AND SHELL OUT EVERY COUPLE WEEKS JUST TO GIVE THEM SOME BUSINESS DIGITAL COPIES ARE MY ABSOLUTE LAST RESORT

IF IT WERE ME I WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE SURE THAT YOU RELEASE IT DIGITALLY THAT WAY THE CIRCULATION ISN'T LIMITED BY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO PRINT UP AND IT OPENS YOU UP TO AN AUDIENCE LARGER THAN WHAT'S IN YOUR LOCAL AREA UNLESS YOU'RE PURPOSELY TRYING TO LIMIT EXPOSURE BEYOND THAT I'D PROBABLY GO WITH CDS
I'VE SOLD WAY MORE CDS THAN I HAVE DIGITAL DOWNLOADS PEOPLE LIKE PHYSICAL COPIES SOME PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET SAY THEY ONLY GET DIGITAL AND THERE ARE SOME BUT I DEFINITELY HAVE GOTTEN MORE MONEY OUT OF CDS THAN DIGITAL

UNLESS YOU DO A BIGGER RUN OF VINYL YOU ARENT GOING TO MAKE ANYTHING ON THEM WHICH IS FINE IF YOU ARE OK WITH JUST BREAKING EVEN BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO GET INTO BEFORE YOU CAN MAKE ANYTHING ABOVE BREAKING EVEN ON EM
YOU'LL DEFINITELY WANT CDS YOU'RE GONNA BE WAITING A LONG TIME ON THAT VINYL
WOW HOLY MOLY

THANKS EVERYONE SO MUCH FOR WEIGHING IN HERE I REALLY APPRECIATE IT BANDCAMP HAS BEEN OUR HOME SINCE THE START SO THERE WILL DEFINITELY BE DIGITAL RELEASES ALSO PONTIFY ITUNES AMAZON ETC

THIS PRETTY MUCH CONFIRMS THAT MY GUT FEELING WAS RIGHT WE ARE SUPER STRETCHED FOR MONEY WHICH IS WHY WE ARE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AT ALL WE RELEASE EVERYTHING INDEPENDENTLY AND ONLY REALLY TWO OF THE FOUR OF US CAN CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY CURRENTLY

WE'RE BOTH REALLY BIG VINYL FANS AND AS A BAND KIND OF FEEL LIKE THIS 3RD RELEASE OF OURS IS REALLY WHERE WE'RE STARTING LIKE THIS IS REALLY A HUGE STEP UP FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE SO WE WANT TO DO A RELEASE AND DO IT RIGHT

WITH ALL OF THAT BEING SAID WE ORIGINALLY WERE PLANNING TO HAVE CDS VINYLS DIGITAL RELEASES AS WELL AS SHIRTS ETC TO GO ALONG WITH THE DO YOU THINK HAVING EVERY FORMAT READY TO ROCK FOR THE INITIAL LAUNCH IS SUPER IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO A DIGITAL AND CD THEN A SECOND FOR VINYL VERSIONS

THANKS AGAIN YOU ALL RULE
MAKE VINYL BUT DON'T DO ANY STUPID COLORED SHIT BLACK USUALLY SOUNDS THE BEST AND LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AS IT SPINS ALSO GRAM IS FUCKING SICK
I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS HERE CDS CERTAINLY DO SELL ESPECIALLY AT LIVE EVENTS I ALWAYS HAVE A HARD TIME TO DECIDE WHAT TO BUY SINCE I AM ON TIGHT BUDGETS TOO
I AM SWIMMING IN SHIRTS ALREADY SO I AM BUYING ALBUMS MORE OFTEN

I RECENTLY BOUGHT A VINYL OF MY FAVOURITE ALBUM BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE BOTH OF THEIR ALBUMS ON CD TWO HOODIES AND SHIRTS LOL YES I KNOW I REALLY LOVE THESE GUYS NEXT GIG I'LL GET THEIR OTHER VINYL XD
THIS IS HOWEVER MY FIRST VINYL OF A BAND BUT I SAW A GOOD AMOUNT SELLING THAT EVENING IN DUBLIN I STAYED AT THE MERCH DESK TILL I WAS THE LAST GUY THERE NE OBLIVISCARIS ALWAYS COMES TO THE MERCHANDISE STAND AFTER THE SHOW WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE

I CAN'T EVEN PLAY THIS YET SINCE THE ONLY VINYL PLAYER IN MY FAMILY IS AT MY BROTHER I DON'T EVEN HAVE SPEAKERS EITHER SOO WILL BE A COSTLY INVESTMENT I AM AN AUDIO LOVER SO I WANT TO BUY SOLID SPEAKERS I HAVE A SETUP FOR MY HEADPHONES WHICH IS SILLY BUT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE BUY STUFF THAT THEY LIKE

SO IF YOUR MUSIC IS WORTH THE MONEY FOR PEOPLE THEY'LL BUY IT I AM CERTAIN ABOUT THIS OF COURSE YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO ASK OTHER BANDS FOR ADVICE INSTEAD OF US FANS THEY HAVE A MUCH BETTER LOOK AT MERCHANDISE SALES YOU CAN FIND A ROUGH IDEA OF WHAT TO EXPECT BASED ON SIMPLE NUMBERS OF COURSE THE MORE BANDS YOU CAN TALK TO THE BETTER TRY TO FIND BANDS THAT ARE IN THE ROUGHLY SAME OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPULARITY BRACKET TO GET THE BEST ESTIMATE



BY FAR THEIR BEST ALBUM IT WAS PRETTY DISAPPOINTING SEEING THEM LAST YEAR BECAUSE THEY'D JUST HAD SOMEONE CAN'T REMEMBER WHO REJOIN THE BAND FROM THE EARLIEST YEARS WHICH TRANSLATED TO JUST ABOUT NO MONDO MEDICABLE
I HAVEN'T LISTENED TO IMPALED FOR YEARS I FORGOT HOW GREAT THEY ARE
GODDAMN THOSE ARE SOME BRUTAL CHICKS
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THRASH METAL BANDS INSANELY FUN ALSO ONE OF THE FEW THRASH METAL BANDS THAT EMERGED IN THE THAT DIDN'T DIP IN QUALITY AS THE DECADES WENT ON THEIR NEW ALBUM IS ONE OF THEIR BEST
PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE BROB SONG THAT RIFF MINUTE IN MUST BE THE HIGHLIGHT OF ALL THE STUFF HE'S WRITTEN WHICH IS NO MEAN FEAT
ONE OF THOSE BANDS I'LL JUST PLAY ALL WHEN I HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND NEED TO GET INTO A GROOVE
THIS IS MY AV BROB SONG
WHAT A MAGNIFICENT TITLE

I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS BAND SINCE HIGH SCHOOL MORE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER THAT NOBODY TALKS ABOUT
FANTASTIC ALBUM GONNA ACTUALLY ADD IT TO MY QUEUE FOR TONIGHT NOW SEEING YOUR POST REMINDED ME OF HOW GREAT IT IS SO THANKS FOR THAT
U PROTOCHAUD U HIGHWAYCORSAIR MIGHT LIKE THIS

I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DOWNVOTES MUST HAVE SOME TROLLS OR ELITISTS HERE GREAT BAND I NEED TO BUY THEIR ALBUMS THANKS FOR THE POST I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THEM
IT'S MY GREATEST REGRET I MISSED THEIR LAST SHOW AN ALL AGES ONE NONETHELESS DUE TO A BLIZZARD WHEN I WAS
SEEMINGLY THEY PLAY WELL AND EVART HAS DONE A GREAT JOB ON THE REMASTER SOURCE FINNISH MUSIC FORUMS AND REVIEWS
WHATEVER IT'S A SICK ALBUM
R HEAVYVINYL MIGHT HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU
THE OTHER BAND BROM IS PRETTY GREAT TOO
YET ANOTHER ARTICLE THAT I CAN'T FINISH WHY DO YOU AND OTHERS SHARE THIS KIND OF THING IT DOESN'T NEED ATTENTION
LIKE ANY OTHER MUSIC WRITER WITH TOO MUCH TIME ON HIS HANDS I SPEND TOO MUCH OF MY TIME STARING INTO THE DARK ABYSS THAT IS THE INTERNET MUSIC COMMUNITY A PLACE WHERE TROLLS RUN FREE IN PIXEL MEADOWS AND ELITISTS PARADE AROUND WITH THEIR BIG DIGITAL DICKS SWINGING WITH WILD ABANDON A PLACE THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU CALL HOME A PLACE THAT YOU FIND SOLACE WITH LIKEMINDED INDIVIDUALS WHO FIND NOTHING MORE HYSTERICAL THAN CALLING EVERY BAND UNDER THE AGE OF FAGS

FIRST PARAGRAPH WISH ME LUCK I AM GOING IN


EDIT ALRIGHT I AM BACK GUYS THIS IS DIRECTED RIGHT AT US YOU KNOW US WHO DO NOT GO TO ANY LOCAL SHOWS AND DO NOT WANT TO TRY ANYTHING NEW ASIDE FROM LISTENING TO REIGN IN BLOOD OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND CALL PEOPLE EMO FAGGOTS HOW DID THEY FIND US WHO LEAKED EMAILS

HAVE A QUICK SEARCH AROUND SOME OF THE BIGGEST WEBSITES BUZZFEED TUMBLR REDDIN AND YOU'LL SEE COUNTLESS POSTS ABOUT HOW MINDBOGGLINGLY FANTASTIC THE WERE YOU KNOW YOU WERE BORN IN IF YOU REMEMBER LITERALLY ANYTHING OR GIBS OF JOHNNY BRAVO OR WORD DISSERTATIONS ON THE BEAUTY OF THE SEGA MEGA DRIVE

I FEEL THIS RANT WAS WRITTEN TO A VERY SPECIFIC INSTANCE BUT THEN THE REST OF THE ARTICLE JUST UNFOLDS INTO NONSENSE TRYING TO WRITE LIKE LESTER BANGS HUNTER S THOMPSON HAVING A STROKE

THAT'S WHAT YOU'D SAY BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INTERNET ARE AFRAID TO TAKE RISKS AND YET COMPLAIN THAT METAL IS DEAD

BUT BUT BUT NO ONE SAID IT WAS WHO SAID IT WAS I KNOW THESE ARTICLES ABOUT METAL BEING DEAD AND METAL NOT BEING DEAD ARE JUST YELLING AT EACH OTHER AND HERE WE ARE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE LIKE A BROKEN HOUSEHOLD
EVEN WITH ALMOST ELEVEN FULL MONTHS OF COMPETITION THAT'S A STRONG CANDIDATE FOR THE MOST CLUELESS ARTICLE POSTED HERE ALL YEAR LONG
I DO APPRECIATE WHEN I KNOW I CAN SKIP AN ARTICLE BASED ON ITS TITLE ALONE THE METAL ISN'T ACTUALLY DEAD RHETORIC IS THE DEADEST HORSE AROUND
WAS THIS WRITTEN IN AND PUT ON HOLD UNTIL TODAY

CHEER ME UP

HAPPY THANKSGIVING
SINCE I AM ONLY DOING A SMALL AMOUNT OF COOKING THIS YEAR I WANTED TO POST A COUPLE OF MY FAVORITE THANKSGIVING RECIPES

ROLLS PAIN AU LAIT LIKE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE I GOT HOOKED ON THE GREAT BRITISH BAKING SHOW BAKE-OFF THESE WERE MY FIRST FORAY INTO YEASTED DOUGH AND THEY'RE EASY ENOUGH FOR A BEGINNER PEARL SUGAR IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY

SWEET POTATOES MARK BROWN BUTTER SAGE STIR-FRY IF YOU HAVE A FOOD PROCESSOR THESE ARE STUPIDLY EASY IF NOT THEY'RE STILL EASY TO MAKE BUT YOU'LL DO A LOT OF WORK GRATING THE POTATOES THE FLAVOR ON THESE IS HUGE AND YOUR GUESTS WILL BE DISPROPORTIONALLY IMPRESSED BY THE UNUSUAL PRESENTATION

MUSHROOM GRAVY FOR YEARS I WAS VEGETARIAN AND STILL MOSTLY AVOID MEAT I COBBLED TOGETHER A MUSHROOM GRAVY RECIPE FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES

FINELY SLICE MUSHROOMS A MIX IS GOOD ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN GET FANCY KINDS LIKE PORCINI CHANTERELLE ETC BUT CRIMINI SHIRTMAKE ARE GOOD AND WIDELY AVAILABLE SAUTE THESE IN A WIDE SKILLET MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ROOM AND LET THEM REALLY BROWN FOR GOD'S SAKE USE SOME WHITE WINE OR BEMOUTH OR MARSALA TO DEGLAZE

GET A BIG SAUCEPAN ADD OLIVE OIL BUTTER AND SWEAT SOME GARLIC AND ONION OR SHALLOT ADD MAYBE TBSP FLOUR TO MAKE A ROUX AND COOK IT UNTIL LIGHT BROWN ADD A LITTLE WINE THEN YOUR MUSHROOMS STIR TO COMBINE ADD CUPS BROTH OR STOCK AND LET IT SIMMER FOR A WHILE

FINISHING YOU CAN THICKEN IF YOU LIKE WITH CORNSTARCH POTATO STARCH ARROWROOT ETC HEAVY CREAM IS A NICE ADDITION OF COURSE YOU'LL WANT SALT AND PEPPER AND I THINK A SECRET WEAPON IS SHERRY VINEGAR OR BALSAMIC ADD JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE GRAVY A BIT TART SERVE OVER EVERYTHING
WHY DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO HEAR ABOUT SPIRIT ADRIFT SHAME ON YOU ALL SERIOUSLY JUST WANTED TO SAY CHECK THESE GENTS OUT THEY ARE AMAZING
I MAY PUT ANOTHER THREAD UP LATER THIS AFTERNOON AS A SPECIAL HOLIDAY TREATISE I HAVE TO GO RUN A NOW BECAUSE I WAS FEELING LIKE I ENJOYED RUNNING AT ONE POINT WHEN I SIGNED UP BUT NOW HATE MYSELF BECAUSE I HATE RUNNING ITS ALSO FUCKING COLD AND RAINING

THIS THREAD
HOW ARE YOU CELEBRATING

I FEEL UNPREPARED THIS ALWAYS SNEAKS UP ON ME
HE DIED YEARS AGO ON MAY SO DAYS
THE SAD THING FOR ME IS THAT I GOT BACK INTO METAL RIGHT AFTER HE DIED WHEN I WAS A KID I LISTENED TO CLASSIC ROCK AND METAL MOSTLY METALLICA AND OTHER MAINSTREAM TYPE STUFF BUT THEN I GOT INTO CLASSICAL MUSIC IN A BIG WAY AND LISTENED TO THAT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOR A DECADE OR SO FROM ABOUT AGE THEN YEARS AGO I STARTED LISTENING TO METAL AGAIN BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO THE GYM THE CLASSICAL WASN'T CUTTING IT FOR THAT PURPOSE AND I WAS ALSO REALLY STRESSED BY LAW SCHOOL WHICH THE METAL HELPED RELIEVE SO THIS TIME AROUND IN THE INTERNET AGE AND WITH SERVICES LIKE PANDORA AND PONTIFY I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO EXPLORE THE WIDE WORLD OF METAL I STARTED WITH THE NWOBHM AND AMERICAN POWER METAL THAT MY PANDORA STATION FED ME AND IT WOULD OCCASIONALLY THROW IN A BIO SONG SO I STARTED SEEKING OUT MORE BIO I LISTENED TO HIS WHOLE DISCOGRAPHY I LISTENED TO BIO SABBATH AND BIO RAINBOW WHICH I LOVED AS MUCH IF NOT MORE STARGAZER AND A LIGHT IN THE BLACK TAKEN TOGETHER IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE PIECE SOMETHING ABOUT VOCALS AND THE MYSTICAL FANTASTICAL QUALITY WITHOUT GETTING TOO WEIRD OF THE SONGS AND LYRICS JUST STRIKES A CHORD WITH ME SO I WAS REALLY REALLY LATE TO THE PARTY AND HAD THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY FAVORITE FIGURE IN METAL PASSING AWAY RIGHT BEFORE I EVEN DISCOVERED HIM I MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A POSER UNFORTUNATELY I WISH I COULD DISCOVER A NEWER METAL ACT THAT RESONATES WITH ME LIKE BIO DOES BUT I HAVE YET TO FIND IT IF ANYONE HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE THEM UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF MY FAVORITE STUFF IS FROM THE AND WHILE IRON MAIDEN AND JUDAS PRIEST ARE STILL CHURNING STUFF OUT WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH LONGER THEY WILL KEEP AT IT

I'M GONNA STAND UP AND SHOUT
MENACING
IS IT REALLY DAYS SINCE OR

HOW IS THIS COUNTED MOST CORRECTLY
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN ON REDDIN TOO LONG
I'M GOING TO SING HIM A SONG I'M A SINGER
WELL THIS WENT FROM METAL AF TO WHITEPOST IN NO TIME
HOW ARE YOU CELEBRATING

I GUESS TODAY IS A GOOD A DAY AS ANY TO START PLAYING THE HOLY DIVER VIDEO GAME STARRING BIO OZZY AND RANDY RHODES THAT I'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE MOOD TO PLAY CASTLEVANIA LATELY SO THIS WORKS OUT PERFECTLY
WHAT
WELL IT LOOK LIKE I'M LISTENING TO RISING HEAVEN AND HELL AND HOLY DIVER AGAIN
THE DEVIL CRIED THE DAY BIO DIED
MY COWORKER SAID IT'S BEEN YEARS MONTHS AND DAYS SINCE LORD BIO RODE HIS ETHEREAL TIGER INTO THE MOUTH OF THE DEVIL WHILE RAINBOW IN THE DARK IS PLAYING
MAN WHAT A DUDE HE WAS OP GOOD JOB THINKING OF HIM HE WAS A MASTER
I'M GLAD TO HELP YOU GET ONE CLOSER TO UPVOTES
ALSO THIS POST IS HAS POINTS RIGHT NOW HETP
ANYONE HEAR IF THERE ARE MORE PLANS FOR SOME LIVE RELEASES SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE SUCH AS THE LIVE IN PHILLY THAT CAME OUT A FEW YEARS AGO
PICKED UP A GREATEST HITS CD FROM THE OTHER DAY I REALLY MISS BIO WHAT A COOL GUY HE WAS

M

THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT

I DIDN'T KNOW WHY AT THE TIME BUT I BINGED SOME BIO SONGS THE OTHER DAY SINGING ALONG
WHEN THERE'S LIGHTNING
YOU KNOW IT ALWAYS BRING ME DOWN

CLOSE ENOUGH
HIS NAME IS BIO AND HE DANCES ON THE SAND
HA I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THIS BUT COINCIDENTALLY WAS LISTENING TO BLACK HEAVEN AND HELL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A GOOD WHILE AMAZING ALBUM AMAZING BAND AMAZING VOCALIST REST IN PEACE BIO
SAME THING I DO EVERY YEAR LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THE MAN'S BEST PERFORMANCES

BLACK SABBATH LIVE AT CASTLE BONINGTON

HEAVEN AND HELL LIVE AT ROCKPALAST

BIO LIVE IN AMSTERDAM

RAINBOW LIVE IN HAMBURG

THIS IS ONLY A SMALL SELECTION OF HIS AMAZING PERFORMANCES
DOES IT MATTER WELL IT DOES TO ME AND I CAN TELL YOU WHY
YOU TRIED OP
I STILL REMEMBER BEING IN HIGH SCHOOL DURING LUNCHTIME WHEN I GOT A TEXT FROM MY STEPDAME THAT HE PASSED AWAY WHAT A DIFFERENT TIME THAT WAS FOR ME
VERY NICE
I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO CATCH BOTH THESE GUYS FAREWELL SHOW IN AND THEN THE REUNION SHOW IN HAHA THEY ARE FUCKING GREAT LIVE
GOT THE CD FOR LIKE 2 BLIND WITHOUT REALIZING THAT THE PRESSING HAS A BUNCH OF LATER SONGS ALONG WITH THE ORIGINAL EPISTLE THE ORIGINAL EP WHICH THIS IS FROM FUCKING RULES A LOT OF THE RECORDINGS ARE FUCKING AWFUL THOUGH A FEW ARE OKAY WAS A CONFUSING TRANSITION UNTIL I REALIZED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY COMPILING MORE THAN ONE RELEASE
FFA OF ALL THE KILLER STUFF SHADOW KINGDOM REISSUES
HELL'S HEADBANGERS CDS FOR SALE EH I GOT THIS SAME CD AS A BLIND BUY AND THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY DAMN GOOD ALSO PICKED UP DECEASED OCTOBER HIGH SPIRITS AND A FEW OTHERS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE DEFINITION OF EPIC METAL I'VE HEARD THE TERM BEFORE BY A BAND LIKE MANILLA ROAD WHICH IS PRETTY TOUGH TO DEFINE ALTHOUGH I CONSIDER THEM MORE TRAD USP
THIS IS A ONE-MAN PROJECT BY A GUY FROM MY CITY I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY ALRIGHT SO I POSTED IT HERE TO GET INTO MORE EARS AND GET THE GUY SOME SUPPORT HOPEFULLY
OKAY SO I JUST HAD TO TAKE A DETOUR FROM MY ORIGINALLY PLANNED EBBMAN SCHEDULE FOR LEGIONS OF PERIMELE I HAVEN'T HAD THIS KIND OF IMMEDIATE FUCK YEAH RESPONSE TO AN ALBUM SINCE METAL REVOLUTION OVER HALF A YEAR AGO

AGGRESSIVE ENERGETIC BLACK METAL WITH FUCKING FAT PRODUCTION AND THEN THEY THROW IN THIS KIND OF GLAM METAL RIFF I AM SOLD
VERY VERY GOOD CHOICE
LZ COME BACK BOK LZ COME BACK

ALWAYS LOVED THIS COVER ARTICLE
I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE DUNGOL AT THEIR FIRST SHOW IN DECADES AT FROST AND FIRE II IN VENTURA THIS YEAR THEY WERE FANTASTIC
MY FAVORITE THING IN HEAVY METAL IS WHEN THE MUSICIANS REFERENCE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE PLAYING HEAVY METAL
HAVING BEEN STRICKEN BY A SUDDEN WAVE OF CEREBRAL INSPIRATION THE GUITAR PLAYER AND VOCALIST DEMANDS TO EMBARK UPON OUR CONVERSATIONAL FORAY WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY

I'M DONE WITH THIS
I DIG THE NEW ALBUM I KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE PISSED BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS HEAVY OR AGGRESSIVE ANYMORE BUT I LISTEN TO ALL SORTS OF STUFF SO I DON'T GIVE A FUCK TO BE HONEST

ONLY CRITICISM I HAVE IS THAT THE CLEAN VOCALS SOUND LIKE TROY SANDERS TRYING TO SING S GOTH ROCK AND THAT'S COMING FROM A HUGE MASTODON FAN AND SOMEONE WHO LIKES A BIT OF S GOTH ROCK
PRETENTIOUS INTERVIEWS LIKE THIS MAKE ME HATE BANDS SO MUCH SHUT THE FUCK UP I GUESS WHEN YOU DROP AN ALBUM THAT'S FUCKING GARBAGE YOU HAVE TO COMPENSATE HOW TOUGH YOU ARE SOMEHOW
WELL THAT WAS PRETENTIOUS AS FUCK

EDIT THIS BIT THO

I READ AN INTRIGUING THEORY IN AN ARTICLE THAT RECEIVED A BIT OF TRACTION A WHILE BACK PRODUCED BY A BLOG THAT PROMOTES EXTREME METAL AND INTERSECTIONAL FEMINISM IT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT EKOI IN FACT ONLY PRETENDS TO BE A FREE-SPIRITED INDIVIDUALIST IN ORDER TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM HIS CLANDESTINE FASCIST LEANINGS THE TIME HAS COME TO CONFRONT HIM
OUT OF CURIOSITY WHEN DO THEY USUALLY ANNOUNCE THESE BECAUSE I'M HOPING TO BE IN FRANCE IN AND WOULD LOVE TO GO
KINDA ANNOYING THESE SELL OUT BEFORE BANDS ARE ANNOUNCED
BADASS ALBUM
WAS JUST LISTENING TO THIS TODAY IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE RAZOR ALBUM BUT THIS SONG KICKS ASS
BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS SO DAMNED GOOD THAT HAUNTING INSTRUMENTAL OPENER THEN STRAIGHT INTO DARKDAY AWWWWWWWWMATE ABSOLUTELY KILLER
LIVING WITH THE SPIRITS OF DEATH

LIVING HELL LIVING DEAD LIVING DEAD

RIFFS HARD
I WAS REVISITING THIS ALBUM JUST YESTERDAY I HONESTLY LIKE EDGE OF SANITY MORE THAN THE OTHER CLASSIC SWEDEATH BANDS THE SPECTRAL SORROWS PURGATORY AFTERGLOW AND CRIMSON ARE ALL FUCKING GREAT
EDGE OF SANITY WAS AN AMAZING BAND BY ALL MEANS EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SWEDISH BANDS I ALSO THINK THAT SOLO ALBUM NIGHTINGALE AS WELL AS HIS NEW WITHERSCAPE PROJECT IS AMAZING HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO PICK UP ANY YET THOUGH
I SUGGEST PUSHING BACK IT'S A WHOLE LOT CUNNER THAN GOING ON THE INTERNET AND CRYING ABOUT GETTING SHOVED AFTERWARDS
THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE AT EVERY METAL OR PUNK SHOW I HAVE BEEN TO IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE PUSHING YOU YOU'LL HAVE TO STAND AT THE SIDES OF THE STAGE
YES THAT'S AT GENERALLY EVERY METAL CONCERT THE CENTER IS USUALLY WHERE THE MOSH PIT FORMS AND IF YOU'RE IN THE FRONT AND CENTER YOU'LL USUALLY HAVE THE PIT RIGHT AGAINST YOUR BACK YOUR BEST BET IS TO GO TO THE SIDES OR STAY IN THE BACK DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE VENUE YOU MIGHT BE FINE IN IN THE CENTER AT A HUGE SHOW IF YOU CAN GET RIGHT AGAINST THE BARRIER EVEN ONE PERSON IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF COSHING YOU'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT AT WHILE YOU'RE AGAINST THE BARRIER TOO BUT IT'S MUCH LESS OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S ONLY COMING FROM YOUR BACK AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO
WHAT THE OTHERS SAID SOMETIMES IT'S FUN TO BE UP FRONT IN THE MADNESS AND CLOSE TO THE BAND OTHER TIMES YOU JUST WANT TO ENJOY THE SHOW WITHOUT A TON OF PEOPLE TOUCHING YOU
YOU COULD HEAR THE BREAKING OF HER BONES
AS THE AXE WENT THROUGH HER NECK
DIDN'T REALISE AT THE TIME
THAT HE KILLED THE ONE THAT HE LOVED

PROBABLY MY SECOND FAVORITE SONG ON THE ALBUM BEHIND OBVIOUSLY ANGEL WITCH
THIS SONG THE TITLE TRACK AND WHITE WITCH ALONE ARE GOOD ENOUGH SONGS TO MAKE THIS BAND LEGENDARY
FUCK YEAH GREAT
GOD I LOVE SATAN
THIS IS WONDERFUL
I'M A SIMPLE MAN I SEE SATAN I UNVOTE
MY FAVOURITE TRACK FROM THE ALBUM
QUITE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THEM AGAIN IN JANUARY
GOOD TUNE A LITTLE SHORT THOUGH
SOUNDS MORE LIKE BLACK DEATH THAN CAVERNOUS DEATH ONE OF THOSE RIFFS IS A STRAIGHT BLACK WITCHERY RIP
ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMILAR BANDS TO PRIMORDIAL LIKE CELTIC THEMED DOOM METAL
MAN I LOVE LASTER AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUSH THEM ON SHREDDING A LOT HAPPY TO SEE THEM REAPPEAR SUCH A UNIQUE IRRESISTIBLE SOUND
REALLY UNDERRATED BAND
OMNIUM GATHERUM HAVE ALRIGHT MUSIC BUT THEIR SINGER CAN'T STOP PUSHING THAT STUPID HAND SIGN THEY HAVE DURING SHOWS CONSTANTLY


DARN NO UK SHOWS

I SAW AMON MARTH A YEAR OR SO AGO AND THEY TOURED HERE A FEW MONTHS BACK SO THAT'S FINE BUT I HOPE DT HIT THE UK AT SOME POINT
THAT SOUNDS AMAZING

FUCK AUSTRALIA I'LL JUST GO SEE KATATONIA IN A FEW DAYS AND DROWN MY SORROWS AWAY I SUPPOSE
WHEN DID AMON MARTH BECOME A BIGGER BAND THAN DT AND BIG ENOUGH THAT THEY GET DT AS SUPPORT NOT EVEN
GOD DAMN NO OFFENSE TO GRAND MAGUS OR TESTAMENT BUT I KINDA WISHED THESE WERE THE SUPPORTS FOR THE UK TOUR LAST MONTH
BECAUSE GOD FORBID I CAN GET DT TO COME BACK TO FLORIDA THE TIME OF YEAR WHERE I ENVY THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POND IS FAST APPROACHING

ESPECIALLY STOKED FOR OMNIUM GATHERUM DT SINCE I'VE ALREADY SEEN AMON MARTH THIS SUMMER
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM AND SHOOT THEIR GIG IN WEEKS THEY'LL BE PLAYING WITH BEHEMOTH I ALSO GET TO DO AN VIDEO INTERVIEW I HOPE

DEMON
HELL
IRON MAIDEN
TOKYO BLADE
TANK
DIAMOND HEAD
VENOM AND WITCH-FINDER GENERAL ARE GOOD BUT NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR REALLY

I MEAN I PROBABLY DON'T NEED MORE BANDS SINCE I'VE NEVER DUG DEEP THROUGH THE DISCOGRAPHIES OF MOST OF THESE BUT I'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE BANDS FROM THAT SCENE ANYWAY OR THAT SOUND LIKE THEY COULD BE FOR THAT MATTER BECAUSE THEY'VE MADE UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF MY LISTENING FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS
YOUR POTENTIAL ARTY MATERIAL FROM THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS ANY GENRE JUST FRESH AND GOOD
CAN I HAVE SOME REALLY DEPRESSIVE DOOM STUFF LIKE WOODS OF YPRES
GIVE ME 2 ALBUMS FROM EACH OF THESE CLASSIC BANDS I'VE NEVER REALLY GOTTEN TO IN DEPTH AND THEN IF THERE IS ANYTHING POST WORTH CHECKING OUT

BOLT THROWER

OBITUARY

OVERKILL

CANNIBAL CORPSE

VADER

NEUROSIS

HIGH ON FIRE JUST GIVE ME 2 ALBUMS SINCE THEY'RE NEWER


TWO THINGS I'M LOOKING FOR MORE BLACK METAL IN THE VEIN OF THE RUINS OF EVEREST ESPECIALLY PRODUCTION WISE SECOND MORE TRAD LIKE HAMMERS OF MISFORTUNE RIFFS WITH LOTS OF KEYBOARD
SUBMITTED THIS TWO WEEKS AGO BUT I ONLY GOT A VERY LIMITED RESPONSE OF WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR PLEASE DON'T JUST LINK ME TO WIKIS I'M FAMILIAR WITH WIKIS

KIND OF A VAGUE REQUEST SO I'LL TRY TO BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE WHAT ARE SOME BANDS OR ALBUMS YOU'D RECOMMEND FOR AFTER YOUR WHERE TO START RECOMMENDATIONS PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY WHERE DO I START WITH X AND GET LOOK AT 2 AND I'M LOOKING FOR ETC IF POSSIBLE I'D LIKE BLACK METAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO GIVE ME MORE MATERIAL FOR EBBMAN BUT I'M INTERESTED TO SEE PEOPLE'S NEXT STEPS FOR BANDS OR GENRES
I'M LOOKING FOR SOME DM THAT SOUNDS LIKE PHLEGETHON COMPOSITION WISE BUT FROM A COUNTRY OUTSIDE OF FINLAND PRODUCTION TONE WISE

ARE THERE METAL BANDS THAT HAVE JAZZ INFLUENCES KIND OF LIKE PROG ROCK BANDS USED TO HAVE

ALSO IS THERE MORE STUFF LIKE THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT

LONG BLACK METAL TRACKS NEED NOT BE ATMOSPHERIC STRICTLY BUT SOMETHING I CAN LISTEN TO WHILE STUDYING

THANKS A LOT IN ADVANCE
LOOKING FOR AN ALBUM WITH BONE-CRUSHING HEAVY AND LONG SONGS LIKE IN ELECTRIC WIZARD'S DOPETHRONE BUT LESS STONER DOOM AND MORE DEATH METAL I'M STILL TRYING BM AND AM GETTING WARMER ABOUT THINGS LIKE SLOW FOREVER ESPECIALLY THE VOCALS THERE BUT I'M LOOKING FOR LOWER HEAVIER VOCALS IDEALLY
LONG SONGS ARE A BONUS IDEAL FOR LONGER RUNS
WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE MODERN DOOM ALBUMS THAT ARE BORDERLINE RADIOFRIENDLY OR PALATABLE TO A CLASSIC ROCK FAN
I'M LOOKING FOR DEATH METAL BANDS THAT SOUND LIKE DEAD CONGREGATION I ALREADY KNOW ABOUT INCANTATION GRAVE MIASMA CRUCIAMENTUM BUT I FEEL LIKE NONE OF THEM CAN COMPARE TO DEAD CONGREGATION IN TERMS OF ATMOSPHERE OR RIFFING
REC ME SOME FINNDEATH ALONG THE LINES OF CONVULSE I ALREADY KNOW OF DEMIGOD DEMILICH RIPPIKOULU ADRAMELECH PURTENANCE AND FUNEBRE
WITH THE COLD WEATHER UPON US I'M IN DIRE NEED OF SOME QUALITY FUN FOLK METAL ALONG THE LINES OF KORPIKLAANI ELUVEITIE AND ENSIFERUM I CURRENTLY LISTEN TO A LOT OF THOSE THREE ALONG WITH AIKONA TURISTAS ALESTORM HEIDEVOLK AND TYR ANY HELP IS APPRECIATED
I'VE BEEN LISTENING INTENTLY TO DOR DE DUH YEAH WHAT A NAME RECENTLY PONTIFY CAN'T SEEM TO RECOMMEND ME ANYTHING SIMILAR I'M ESPECIALLY FOND OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE ALBUM

BASICALLY ATMOSPHERIC BLACK METAL WITH A BIT MORE COMPLEXITY THAN SAY BURTRUM ANYONE GOT ANY SIMILAR BANDS
HEY GUYS CAN ANYONE INTRODUCE ME TO THE FRENCH AND THE METAL SCENE I CAME ACROSS THE TERM METAL NOIR AND IT SPARKED MY INTEREST AND I ALSO LIVE IN A COUNTRY BORDERING FRANCE SO WHY NOT GET ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR SCENE IN CASE THEY TOUR NEAR ME SO FAR I KNOW ABOUT GOAJIRO AND ALCES AND A FEW VERY SMALL BANDS I STUMBLED OVER ON BANDCAMP ON MY QUEST FOR FREE MUSIC BUT THOSE ARE MAINLY

BUT THERE'S ANOTHER THING I WANT TO ASK I NOTICED EBBMAN IS ALL ABOUT COLD AND ICY BLACK METAL CAN SOMEONE GIVE ME HOT AND FIERY BLACK METAL

THANKS IN ADVANCE
ANYONE KNOW OF ANY VOCALS AND ATMOSPHERE AS GOOD AS MENHIR FOUND ANYWHERE ELSE IN METAL PREFERABLY THE SAME STYLE OF FOLK BUT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

EDIT XIV DARK CENTURIES IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST I ALREADY KNOW
IS BLACKENED STONER A THING

THE CLOSEST I CAN THINK OF IS SLOW FOREVER BUT EVEN IF HAS MORE OF A SLUDGY HARSH VIBE THAN WHAT I'M THINKING OF THE REASON I ASK IS GENERAL METAL THREAD MY RESPONSE TO AN IDEAL HYBRID PROJECT WOULD BE AN ATMOBLACK WITT OR SOME SUCH COLLABORATING WITH OM OR AUM ETC DOES ANYTHING LIKE THIS EXIST THERE'S DEFINITELY AN INCONSISTENCY IN AESTHETIC TONE ONE BEING COLD AND THE OTHER VERY WARM BUT THERE'S A DEFINITE SHARED TRAIT OF AND DRONING LONG SONGS BETWEEN ATMOBLACK AND STONER
I'M LOVING THE SONG REVEL IN BONES BY RAGE NUCLEAIRE

WHAT OTHER BANDS SONGS HAVE THOSE SAD BUT POWERFUL BLACK METAL RIFFS
GIVE ME ALL THE SPEED METAL YOU HAVE BONUS POINTS FOR BANDCAMP VINYL

EDIT NEW OLD PRODUCED OR RAW AS FUCK GIMME ALL OF IT
APPARENTLY THOSE ARPEGGIOS TOWARD THE BEGINNING ARE THE HARDEST THING PETRUCCI EVER PLAYED I'VE NEVER ATTEMPTED TO LEARN THEM BUT EVEN HE STRUGGLES WITH THEM LIVE ANYWAYS GREAT SONG I LOVE THE AA SUITE
PROBABLY MY LEAST FAVORITE TRACK ON WHAT MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE DT ALBUM THERE ARE A TON OF GREAT RIFFS AND THE DRUMMING PER USUAL IS SUBLIME BUT IT SEEMS TO DRAG ON A LITTLE TOO LONG FOR MY TASTE ALSO THE LYRICS ABOUT THE AA STUFF ARE QUITE TRITE WHICH WE'RE TALKING MIKE PORTNOY WRITING LYRICS SO IT'S NOT SHOCKING ALL THAT BEING SAID I STILL LOVE THIS SONG
TSH I NEVER REALLY GOT THE DREAM THEATRE LOVE I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY PIONEERED THE GENRE BUT I NEVER REALLY FINISHED ANY OF THEIR ALBUMS IF I WERE TO DO SO WHERE DO I START
OH YEAH THIS IS FILTHY
THAT HIEROPHANT COVER ARTWORK IS AWESOME THINK I HAVE TO ASSUME IT WAS DONE BY PAULO GIRARDI
THAT'S A NICE LIST ESPECIALLY GLAD TO SEE ASSÜCK UP THERE AS WELL AS MY FAVORITE BOLT THROWER RECORD
THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD TO CHANGE THE NAME WHEN HAT LEFT

FOR THOSE OF YOU DISAPPOINTED BY THE WAY THE NEW BLAZER TURNED OUT THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY MUCH A CLONE OF AURA WITH RELATIVELY FEW OUTSIDE INFLUENCES THOUGH THOSE INFLUENCES DO SHOW THEMSELVES OCCASIONALLY
THOSE FUCKING DRUMS
ALSO IF ANYONE COULD RECOMMEND SIMILAR BANDS THA WOULD BE GREAT
HANDLERS MULTIVERSEID TYPE CARD
BEHEADING TYRANTS EXCEEDED ALL OF MY EXPECTATIONS IT MAY WELL JUST END UP AS A LATE ENTRY IN MY TOP TEN
SO THIS WAS WHAT ADA WAS BEFORE THEY DECIDED TO REBRAND THEMSELVES I GUESS IF YOU LIKE CRADLE OF FILTH OR HECATE ENTHRONED THEN THIS IS COOL
NICE FIND I'D RATHER CALL IT PROG BLACK
THIS VIDEO IS AWFUL BUT I'M REALLY EXCITED FOR THE NEW ALBUM
THAT SHOULD HAVE SAID DAMMIT

OOPS

NICE
THIS BAND NEEDS MORE APPRECIATION TRONDHEIM MANIACS
THAT'S A SERIOUS GROOVE THEY GET INTO
I ADORE THIS ALBUM
SINCE THIS IS GETTING A BIT OF TRACTION FANS SHOULD CHECK OUT OTHER ARTISTS LIKE BUFFALO BANG BLUES CREATION HIGH TIDE JERUSALEM BUDGIE DUST STRAY SIR LORD BALTIMORE WISHBONE ASH AND SPOOKY TOOTH PROTO IS PRETTY BOMB
LOVE ME SOME FLOWER TRAVELLING BAND THE HEAVIEST EARLY METAL ALBUM
I SAW THIS BAND IN A LITTLE CLUB AT SSW OR YEARS AGO I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THEM AND HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT WAS BLOWN AWAY
BONUS ARG HIMSELF PLAYING IT
I HOPE DOEST JOINS BLINK ON STAGE TO PLAY HIS
DON'T LEAVE ME BOING
ALL ALONE BOING
BLINK ARE ONE OF THE HEADLINERS AT TONS OF ROCK FESTIVAL WHICH ALSO INCLUDES A GOOD AMOUNT OF HIGH-QUALITY NORWEGIAN BLACK METAL LIKE THE LEGENDARY EMPEROR CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF ANTHEMS TO THE WELKIN AT DUSK SATYRION AND ATAKE THERE S ALSO DOOM LEGENDS CANDLEMAS GERMAN THRASH VETS SODOM SWEDISH POWER METALLER SABATON PLAYING S CAROLUS REX AND MORE

THIS IS SO GREAT IT READS LIKE THE ONION
HOPEFULLY THEY JUST COME OUT AND PLAY DUDE RANCH IN ITS ENTIRETY
SAY IT AIN'T SO I WILL NOT GO

ACTUALLY I'D TOTALLY GO IF IT WASN'T IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY
R NOTTHEONION
CONSIDERING THEIR REPUTATION FOR BEING A KINDA SILLY BAND I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY CAME OUT IN CORPSE PAINT AND DID SOME SILLY KINDA BLACK METAL JAM FOR A MINUTE OR SO

NOT SURE WHAT BLINK WILL DO THOUGH
TRAVIS BARKER DRESSING UP LIKE THIS HETP WASN'T SO WEIRD AFTER ALL
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S BLINK ON A BLACK METAL LINEUP IT'S A VARIETY OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT STYLES OF HEAVIER GUITAR MUSIC REALLY NOT MUCH STRANGE ABOUT IT IF YOU ASK ME
I'VE SEEN EMPEROR ONE TIME ON A US TOUR ABOUT A DECADE AGO THEY PLAYED A SMALL CLUB IN CHICAGO CALLED THE METRO IT HOUSES MAYBE PEOPLE THEY WERE THE HEADLINERS I DISCOVERED A NEW BAND THAT NIGHT WHEN THE ROCKABILLY GROUP REVEREND HORTON HEAT OPENED FOR THEM

THAT WAS ONE CONFUSED CROWD WHEN GUY CARRIED OUT A STAND UP BASS
WHAT THE FUCK
WISH THIS WAS IN BROOKLYN
BEER BOTTLES APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD
SORRY WHAT
I'LL MEET YOU IN THE MIDDLE AT THE GHOST BATH SHOW
IF TOM DELONG WAS STILL IN BLINK I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE TO SEE THAT LINEUP
THIS YEAR
WHAT HAPPENED
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
WHY THE HELL IS ATAKE LISTED LEGENDARY BAND
WAIT IS THIS A DIFFERENT BLINK OR
VERY INTERESTING LINEUP I WAS REALLY CLOSE TO BUYING TICKETS TO THIS SHOW BUT DECIDED TO GO WITH BEYOND THE GATES INSTEAD KIND OF GLAD I DID NOT THAT I HAVE AN INHERENT PROBLEM WITH BLINK JUST NOT WHAT I'D WANT TO FLY TO NORWAY FOR THOUGH I'M SAD I WON'T SEE EMPEROR UNLESS THEY COME TO THE US
WAS THERE LAST YEAR GREAT FESTIVAL LINEUP THIS YEAR IS STRANGE DEATH METAL LEGENDS SODOM ARE BELOW SATYRION ON THE FLYERS WHICH MAKES ABSOLUTELY SENSE THERE WERE SOME BORDERLINE CRINGE BANDS LAST YEAR BUT NOW
I LOVE HOW THIS FESTIVAL HAS ALL OF MY GUILTY PLEASURES AND PLEASURES TOGETHER
BLINK EMPEROR SOUNDS LIKE SUCH A BIZARRE COMBINATION

I KNOW IT'S SOME FESTIVAL BUT MAN THOSE TWO IN ONE SENTENCE
I THOUGHT EMPEROR CALLED IT A DAY AFTER THE ANNIVERSARY OF IN THE NIGHTSIDE ECLIPSE TOUR
I'M REALLY CONFUSE
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE BLINK GET INTERVIEWED BEFORE AND AFTER THE SHOW
WHAT THE FUCK

PAGE SOUTH LOVE BROOKLYN VEGAN
WELL THAT'S UNEXPECTED AIRBORNE TOO THEY'RE A BIT OUT OF PLACE NEXT TO THE OTHERS
I WOULD UNIRONICALLY PAY MONEY TO SEE THIS
I'M ONLY SLIGHTLY SURPRISED BLINK IS ABOVE EMPEROR ON THE BILL IT STILL HURTS THOUGH
A
DUDE WTF
GRABBED TWO HELL CDS FOR EACH IF YOU USE BLASTOFF YOU GET AN EXTRA OFFICIAL THANKS TO A COUPLE OF DUDES IN R POWERMETAL FOR THE SALE ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE EXTRA COUPON CODE

GREAT THERE'S RUMORS OF A NEW ALBUM SOON
HOPE I SHOW SOMEONE A GOOD BAND TO CHECK OUT IVE ONLY LISTENED TO THEIR FIRST RECORD LET ME KNOW IF YOUVE GOT ANY RECOMMENDATIONS
ENTER THE GRAVE IS GREAT BUT PERSONALLY I THINK THIS IS ONE OF ITS WEAKER SONGS YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY CHECK OUT THEIR OTHER ALBUMS FIVE SERPENTS TEETH AND SKULL ARE AWESOME
GREAT CLASSIC
YO ITS GONE GOT ANOTHER LINK
PAUL GILBERT IS THE BEST I ENJOY HIS NEW ROCK ALBUMS BUT I KINDA WISH HE'D PUT ON THE BRIGHT PINK EPIPHONEMA GUITAR AGAIN TEASE HIS HAIR AND START PLAYING SOME REALLY ASS METAL
POUNDING DOWN THE BACK ROADS HIGHER THAN A STEEPLE

ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS ALL HAIL GILBERT
ALL THIS LOVE FOR PAUL GILBERT AND NONE FOR JUAN ALDARETE DA FAQ YO
GILBY IS NOT JUST ONE OF THE BEST SHREDDERS EVER HES SOOSOO NICE
PAUL GILBERT IS THE MAN
THAT'S AWESOME

GREEN GREENS NICE
FANTASTIC DEMO
THIS PLACE IS LITERALLY MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE DEFINITELY GONNA BE LOOKING INTO THIS
LINEUP IS KILLER I'D LOVE TO MAKE IT OUT TO ONE OF THESE SOME DAY
WRETCH WAS ON TOP OF LIST
MAN THERE ARE SOME KILLER BANDS PLAYING I WISH I COULD MAKE IT
I WOULDN'T MIND SEEING THE ATOMIC BITCHWAX
OH SHIT CAVERN IS PLAYING HELL YEA I'D LOVE TO SEE DESTROYER OF MAN ON THIS LINEUP
REMINDME 2 MONTHS
DOLLARS FOR FOUR DAYS OF MUSIC FOR FUCK SAKE MOST WE HAD IN AUSTRALIA WAS GROUNDWAVE AND THAT WAS OVER FOR ONE EUCKEN DAY AND THAT WAS BEFORE IT STOPPED RUNNING COS THE PROMOTER WENT EUCKEN BANKRUPT
HOLY FUCK CAPTAIN BEYOND I'M NOWHERE NEAR MARYLAND BUT THAT IS BEYOND AWESOME I HAD NO IDEA THEY STILL PLAY STILL ANY GOOD LIVE
TOO BAD IT'S THE SAME WEEKEND AS ROCKIEST
MY BAND OPENED FOR APOSTLE OF SOLITUDE SOME MONTHS BACK GOOD DUDES GOOD DOOM GLAD TO SEE THESE GUYS ARE ON A GOOD SPOT
YOU CLEARLY ARE MORE SKILLED AT POSTING THAN I AM I POSTED THIS A FEW WEEKS AGO AND GOT ALMOST ZERO RESPONSES

LAST YEAR WAS TONS OF FUN THIS YEAR LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD BE FUN TOO HOWEVER I DON'T THINK THE LINEUP IS QUITE AS GOOD AS LAST YEAR NO WINO AND NO VICTOR GRIFFIN AND I WAS REALLY HOPING TO SEE UNORTHODOX ON THE BILL AGAIN BECAUSE THEY WERE ON IT LAST YEAR AND CANCELLED THE DAY BEFORE THE SHOW AND I WAS REALLY BUMMED I DIDN'T GET TO SEE THEM
BANDS I WOULD SAY ARE DEFINITELY WORTHY OF CHECKING OUT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

VALKYRIE BEASTMAKER CAPTAIN BEYOND THE WELL WRETCH THE SKULL BANG WO FAT OLD BLOOD AND HOREHOUND
CHAPS IT TAKES A CERTAIN KIND OF GUY TO HANG THEIR ASS OUT ON STAGE IT'S WHATEVER I GUESS FUCKING S
EVERY WEEK APPARENTLY WHATEVER I LIKE WASP
ATTENTION FEMALE METALHEADS LISTENING TO WASP MAY RESULT IN SPONTANEOUS PREGNANCY VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED
ALWAYS UNVOTE ASPIS WAS READING A RUSSIAN INTERVIEW WITH THEM FROM A YEAR OR TWO AGO WHERE TWO OF THE MEMBERS CLAIMED THAT ANOTHER MEMBER HAD ATTEMPTED TO USURP THE ENTIRE BAND BY CLAIMING THAT HE CAME UP WITH THE NAME AND ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH HIS OWN VERSION OF THE BAND WHERE HE'D HAVE FULL CONTROL SEEMS AS IF THE TWO BANDMEMBERS INTERVIEWED WERE ACTUALLY QUITE KEEN ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER NEW MATERIAL AND HAD BEEN WORKING ON SOME BUT THIS DEVELOPMENT HAD DERAILED THE CHANCES OF NEW STUFF COMING OUT

EDIT INTERVIEW IS HERE FOR IT WAS ACTUALLY THE DRUMMER WHO PLAYED LITTLE ROLE IN THE WRITING WHO SUDDENLY ATTEMPTED TO TAKE CONTROL AND THROUGH ALL THE HEADACHES THE OTHER MEMBERS LOST INTEREST IN CONTINUING THE BAND
WHEN I POST ASPIS I GOT LIKE 2 UPVOTES
FANTASTIC ALBUM FANS SHOULD CHECK OUT EARLY OBLIVION TOO DEMOS AND FROM THIS DAY FORWARD
WOW I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR METAL COVERS OF SUCH STAR WARS CLASSICS AS
THE IMPERIAL MARCH
DUEL OF FATES
THE CANTINA SONG
AND UH THAT SONG FROM PALACE FUCK THIS PROJECT
THESE INSERT POP CULTURE TOPIC THEMED BANDS ARE ALWAYS AWFUL LIKE THAT NED FLANDERS BAND WAS JUST TERRIBLE AND I GENERALLY DISLIKE LABELING STUFF AS BAD AWFUL TERRIBLE ETC
R EMPIREDIDNOTHINGWRONG


CRYSTAL AGE AND DVC REMAIN THE BEST STAR WARS THEMED METAL
FUCK YEAH SO GOOD
INCREDIBLE BAND HOPING TO SCORE MORE OF THEIR FOR CHRISTMAS
FFA BLACKSMITH

GOOD CALL THERE'S PROBABLY A TON OF PEOPLE WHO LIKE THEM AND HAVEN'T HEARD JAG PANZER BEFORE
GIVE M HELL CAUSE YOU'RE HARDER THAN STEEEEEL

OH WRONG SONG
DOTS RAISES A GOOD POINT IT'S THIS BLACKSMITH I'M MENTIONING IN THE TITLE
PROOF THAT METAL IS LITERALLY CLASSICAL

I HAVEN'T REALLY LISTENED TO MUCH JOEY TAFOLLA STUFF EVEN THOUGH I'VE CHECKED OUT MOST OF THE SHRAPNEL LINEUP OTHERWISE BASED ON HIS PLAYING HERE HE'S STILL A FAIR BIT BEHIND HIS CONTEMPORARIES BUT I'VE NEVER LISTENED TO HIS SOLO STUFF
TO BE QUITE HONEST I'M PRETTY TURNED OFF BY A LOT O USP BUT I DO ENJOY ANY JAG PANZER THAT I'VE HEARD
ANY NEWS ON THE NEW ALBUM
LOVE THE BAND BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO THE SINGER ANY RECS FOR THEIR BEST SONGS IN TERM OF VOCALS
I'M JUST A CASUAL FAN BUT I ALWAYS LOVED JAG OF LICENSED TO KILL I KNOW THE BAND ONLY DID IT BECAUSE OF ISSUES WITH JOEY AND MOST PEOPLE HATE THE ON DECADE OF THE BAT BUT I JUST LOVE THE RAWNESS OF IT
WHO THOUGHT THE HARD RIGHT PAN AT THE BEGINNING WAS A GOOD IDEA
THIS POST FINALLY INSPIRED ME TO TRACK A PHYSICAL COPY OF THIS ALBUM DOWN THANK YOU
SAME ARTIST THAT DID THIS COVER IS DOING SOME DEMO ART FOR ME PRETTY STOKED
LOVE THIS SONG
SOUNDS A BIT LIKE CHROME DIVISION JUST THROWING THAT OUT THERE
LOVE THIS ALBUM PROBABLY ARTY FOR ME
LOVE THIS ALBUM YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYING AND IT IS SO AGGRESSIVE
IF YOU'RE INTO THE BANDS YOU'LL HAVE FUN ACCOMMODATION IS PRETTY ALRIGHT ASIDE FROM THE WEATHER AND THE LARGE DISTANCES THIS YEAR TICKETS DIDN'T SELL OUT CIRC IT'S USUALLY CLOSE WHETHER THAT HAPPENS
OH SHIT THESE GUYS EXIST I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THIS LOVELY ALBUM

SHREDDITS SECRET SATAN THURSDAY

THIS WILL BE POSTED AS ITS OWN THREAD AND WILL BE LINKED IN THE SIDEBAR WITH AN APPROPRIATE HOLIDAY PICTURE IF YOU WANT TO SEE A CLUSTERFUCK OF INTEREST JUST SEARCH HEAVY METAL CHRISTMAS AND LOOK AT THE MINEFIELD OF STUPIDITY I WAS LOOKING THROUGH LAST NIGHT

HEAVY METAL HOLIDAYS

EVERY ALBUM OF THE WEEK FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER WILL COME IN PAIRS AND BE PRESENTED AS A SUPER TEAM YOU HAVE ALL BEEN GOOD THIS YEAR EXCEPT FOR THE PHIL ANSELMO THREAD AND THE MODS WANTED TO GIVE YOU ALL MORE MUSIC AND INTRODUCE YOU TO ALBUMS YOU MOST LIKELY HAVENT HEARD DON'T SHAKE THE BOX IT IS NOT MEGADEATH NOR AN IPHONE

BEST DEMOS EPS SPLITS COMPILATIONS OF

DESPITE THE ANEURYSM U DOEDANZEE IS HAVING ABOUT US HAVING THIS WITH DAYS LEFT IN THE CALENDAR YEAR WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE ONE HALF OF OUR END OF THE YEAR CELEBRATIONS THROWING CONFETTI ON THOSE RELEASES THAT NEVER GET ANY RECOGNITION UNLESS YOU ARE GORGETS AND THE BLOG WRITER DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANY OTHER ALBUMS AND WHO IS GOING TO KNOW COME CELEBRATE SOME OF THE BEST RELEASES THAT ONLY A FEW HAVE HEARD IN A SMALL PARKING LOT OVERLOOKING THE STADIUM WHERE METALLICA IS HAVING THEIR PARADE






I'VE NEVER LISTENED TO METAL UNTIL MAYBE A WEEK AGO I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT I WAS DOING I THINK I WAS CURIOUS WHAT IT WAS AND SEARCHED SLAYER AND JUST STARTED LISTENING TO RAINING BLOOD SINCE IT'S THEIR MOST POPULAR SONG ON GOOGLE PLAY MUSIC NOW I'M ON THIS SUBREDDIT LISTENING TO THE STUFF IN THE WHYBLT THREAD REALLY LIKING ALVER BERGTATT AOR GUARDIANS MASTER'S HAMMER RITUAL AND INSOMNIOUS GATE BTW I EVEN STARTED PLAYING DRUMS AGAIN AFTER NOT TOUCHING MY DRUM SET FOR MONTHS I USED TO PLAY IN MY HIGH SCHOOL JAZZ BAND NOW IT'S JUST A HOBBY I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS
WHY OH WHY DO BANDS VENUES SACRIFICE CLARITY FOR LOUDNESS AT SHOWS I UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF METAL'S DRAWS FOR PEOPLE IS THE ENERGY IT GENERATES IN A LIVE SETTING HENCE THE VOLUME BUT YOU KNOW WHAT GENERATES ENERGY FAT FUCKING RIFFS WHICH I CAN'T DISTINGUISH WHEN YOU'D RATHER JUST TRY TO BLOW OUT SOME EARDRUMS

ALSO HOW ON EARTH DO PEOPLE EVER GO TO CONCERTS WITHOUT EAR PLUGS
WHAT COLLABORATIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE BETWEEN ARTISTS

I'D LOVE TO SEE GNAW THEIR TONGUES TEAM UP WITH AAAL NATHRAKH I FEEL IT COULD RESTORE THAT CLAUSTROPHOBIC EVIL OF THEIR EARLY RELEASES AND EVEN SURPASS IT

AS MASSIVE FAN OF POP CULTURE BUT SO-SO ON POP MUSIC SEEING A SOLID ARTIST LIKE PERTURBATOR OR TEAM UP WITH A HAVOC OR RETRO HEAVY LIKE EVIL INVADERS TO GIVE A MORE WHOLISTIC CHEESY ALBUM WOULD BE SICK

LASTLY I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY WOULD BLEND BEST WITH BUT SEEING THE MAIN MAN BEHIND WARDRUNA CONTRIBUTE WITH EITHER A FOLK BLACK OR ATMOBLACK BAND WOULD BE SICK MY FAVOURITE ARE AOR AND PANOPTICON BUT I DONT THINK THE NORDIC STYLE WOULD GEL MAYBE FALKENBACK

I PERSONALLY LOVE THE ELITISM IN METAL ITS NOT ALL METAL
WHAT
U UNANIMATEDFELIX COME BACK YOU CAN BLAME IT ALL ON ME
THESE NEW METALLICA SONGS ALL SOUND REALLY DULL WHY ARE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THEM LIKE THEY'RE GOOD
INQUISITION AND MAYHEM ARE COMING TO MINNEAPOLIS IN JANUARY I SAW MAYHEM TWO YEARS AGO THEY WEREN'T THAT GOOD LIVE I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED TO SEE INQUISITION HAS ANYONE CAUGHT THIS TOUR YET
I FINALLY BIT THE BULLET AND SPENT ON DEVIN ZILTOID THE OMNISCIENT LP THE MIX IS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION AND THIS RECORD IS NOW MY PRIZED POSSESSION
JUST FOUND OUT TODAY THAT HAMMERFALL ARE RELEASING A ALBUM LP LIMITED EDITION BOSSET NEXT YEAR I REALLY WANT IT WHAT ARE SOME SPECIAL EDITION RELEASES YOU'VE GOT
LOOKING FOR BANDS LIKE AGUNAH OR ACID KING SLOW DOOM FEMALE VOCALS GIMME YOUR BEST
SO THIS IS AN ODD LINEUP
AGENT ORANGE WE ARE THE BLACK WIZARDS AND ALL THE SMALL THINGS DON'T SEEM LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE A TON OF CROSSOVER APPEAL

THOUGH I SUPPOSE I LIKE ALL THREE SO THAT THROWS MY THEORY OUT THE WINDOW

LOOOOOOL HETP
ARE THERE ANY BANDS YOU THINK HAVE A PERFECT DISCOGRAPHY THE ONLY TWO I COULD THINK OF LOOKING THROUGH MY LIBRARY ARE

DEATH

VEATOR

OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME ONE ALBUM OR TWO ALBUM BANDS THAT WOULD FIT THE BILL BUT I WAS TRYING TO LIMIT IT TO THREE ALBUMS OR MORE
WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE BALLPARK IN BUYING AN ALBUM LIKE A FULL RELEASE MIN ALBUM I KNOW EVERY RELEASE IS DIFFERENT BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE TO AIM FOR A NEARLY THIRTY MIN ATMOSPHERIC BLACK METAL ALBUM SEEMS OVERVALUED WHILE SOMEWHERE AROUND DOLLARS SEEMS A BIT BETTER IF ANYTHING I MEAN IF IT'S A RELEASE I LIKE I'LL PAY MORE OBVIOUSLY BUT WHAT IS A GOOD AVERAGE TO AIM FOR
WHO'S DOING EBBMAN HERE AND HOS STAYED TARVE TO IT
CAN WE JUST QUICKLY APPRECIATE HOW GOOD THIS YEAR HAS BEEN FOR TRADITIONAL HEAVY METAL I DON'T LISTEN TO HEAVY METAL AS MUCH AS I DO SOME OTHER GENRES BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A GREAT NUMBER OF TOP QUALITY RELEASES THIS YEAR
SO I WENT TO THE DISTURBED CONCERT HERE IN NEW ZEALAND ON FRIDAY NIGHT IT WAS AWESOME THEY REALLY PUT ON A GOOD SHOW REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THEIR MUSIC THE LIGHTING AND PYROTECHNICS WERE GREAT YOU COULD HEAR THE SEPARATE INSTRUMENTS ALL CLEARLY AND THE BASS WAS THERE YOU CAN TELL THEY REALLY ENJOY PLAYING THEIR MUSIC DAVID WAS WAVING HIS HANDS AROUND LIKE A CONDUCTOR FOR THE PYRO DAN WAS PUTTING ON A LITTLE SHOW EVERY TIME HE SAW A CAMERA POINTED AT HIM AND SINGING ALONG TO ALL THE CHORUSES EVEN WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE A MIC IN FRONT OF HIM

AS PER U REQUEST I PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BAND SHIRTS PRESENT IT WAS PRETTY BAD BY THE TIME EVERYONE HAD BEEN PAST THE MERCH BOOTH ABOUT HALF TO TWO-THIRDS OF THE CROWD HAD DISTURBED SHIRTS ON WITH A HANDFUL OF DEVILKIN THE OPENING ACT ONES EVERYONE ELSE WAS JUST WEARING AN ASSORTMENT OF THE MOST GENERIC BAND SHIRTS AVAILABLE MOSTLY METALLICA AND IRON MAIDEN A BUNCH OF SLIPKNOT KORN ETC I SAW ONE SINGLE BATTLE VEST AND IT HAD METALCORE PATCHES ALL OVER IT
I USUALLY NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING OFF OF BANDCAMP BUT I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ANY STREAMING SERVICE THAT HAS THE NEW QUICKSAND DREAM ALBUM I HAVE BEEN HYPED THE EVER LIVING HELL OUT OF THIS ALBUM SO I REALLY HOPE ITS WORTH THE PURCHASE AT THE VERY LEAST IM SUPPORTING THE BAND
SO I BOOKED TICKETS TO SEE ANTHRAX IN FEBRUARY THEY'RE MY LEAST FAVOURITE OF THE BIG BUT THEY'RE STILL A CLASSIC BAND SO I BOUGHT A TICKET WHEN I SAW THEY WOULD BE IN THE CITY CLOSEST TO ME

ANYONE SEEN THEM RECENTLY ARE THEY GOOD LIVE
SO MY FRIEND TAGGED ME IN A PICTURE THAT WAS LIKE ONE OF THOSE YOU ARE WHAT YOU LISTEN TO AND ON THE BOTTOM WAS SOME BAPHOMET IN LIKE A BURNING CHURCH I BOUGHT A BLACK WITCHERY CD ON FRIDAY AND WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE BOOKLET AND THAT EXACT PICTURE WAS IN THE BOOKLET IT WAS A FUNNY COINCIDENCE

ON THAT NOTE I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO A BIT MORE WAR METAL BEEN HITTING BLACK WITCHERY HARD AND I'VE ALSO BEEN DIGGING CAVEMAN CULT I'M ADMITTEDLY LIKING BOTH THESE BANDS MORE THAN REVENGE WHICH WERE MY INTRODUCTION TO THE SCENE

I ALSO ORDERED THE BAT DEBUT ALBUM ON WHITE VINYL AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY DAD CAN'T WAIT TO GIVE IT TO HIM
STILL WAITING FOR THE MONOLITH REMASTERIES TRIUMVIRATE TO ARRIVE AT ITS DESTINATION
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK WHAT YOU GREW UP LISTENING TO AFFECTS YOUR FUTURE MUSICAL PREFERENCES SPECIFICALLY PRODUCTION VALUES OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THIS COMMUNITY LOVES RAW PRODUCTION I'M WONDERING IF THOSE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO STARTED ON METALLICA MORBID ANGEL ETC I GREW UP ON BANDS LIKE DISTURBED AND LANKIN PARK AND FIND THAT I PREFER CLEAN PRODUCTION LIKE NEWER CANNIBAL CORPSE AND CATTLE DECAPITATION I OPPOSE DRUM TRIGGERS MACHINES ON PRINCIPLE BUT FIND THAT I LOVE THE SOUND THEY CAN GIVE FEAR FACTORY AAAL NATHRAKH
I'M REALLY IN LOVE WITH THE NEW KHEMMIS HUNTED

AND IT CAME OUT LAST YEAR BUT THE LATEST CATTLE DECAPITATION IS AMAZING
ARE THERE BANDS THAT MIX PUNK AND METAL BUT ARE NOT HARDCORE PUNK DOES THAT EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE

I'M JUST SITTING HERE LISTENING TO THE ART OF DROWNING AND THINKING MAN I'D LOVE A METAL VERSION OF THIS
BEEN WATCHING SATANIC BARMASTER LIVE VIDEOS THE NEW MAYHEM LIVE VIDEOS AND BLOOD CHALICE LIVE VIDEOS ANY GOOD BLACK METAL LIVE RECORDINGS PREFERABLY WITH VIDEO THAT I SHOULD CHECK OUT
DOES ANYONE STILL USE ON THE REGULAR

JUST RECENTLY GOT BACK INTO USING IT AND HAD TO CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT SINCE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SCROBBLE TAPES AND VINYL I STOPPED USING IT
USER
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A BEST OF BLACK METAL PLAYLIST ON PONTIFY SO FAR I ONLY HAVE AROUND SONGS THE PLAYLIST IS COLLABORATIVE SO YOU GUYS CAN ADD TRACKS THAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE ON IT HERE'S THE LINK
HEY HEY I KNOW I'M ALWAYS LATE TO THIS THREAD SORRY WEST COAST MAN

SO LAST WEEK I STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS NEW ANTAEUS ALBUM BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE LIKED IT AND I WAS FULL OF MPH FOR IT

ANYWAYS IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY U HIGHWAYCORSAIR AND U DZORRILLA THAT I LISTEN TO ALL OF THEIR ALBUMS FIRST THEN REVISIT THIS NEW RELEASE I DID THAT AND I'M BACK WITH MY RESPONSE

IT'S STILL A BIG MPH IN FACT ALL OF THE ALBUMS WERE PRETTY MPH FOR ME INCLUDING BLOOD LIBELS

I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT SOMETHING LIKE ANTAEUS WILL SOUND FAIRLY UNINTERESTING TO ME WHILE SOMETHING LIKE VAKASS WILL IMMEDIATELY GRAB MY ATTENTION

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE HERE AND DO PEOPLE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THE TWO SONGS LINKED

PERSONALLY I THINK ANTAEUS SUFFERS FROM NOT CHANGING THEIR RIFFS WITHIN THEIR SONGS ENOUGH AND THEY DON'T HAVE PUNCHY MOMENTS OR FLOURISHES WITH EITHER THE DRUMS OR GUITAR IN THE WAY THAT VAKASS DOES
I REALLY LOVE DEATH METAL BUT I REFUSE TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING SATANIC IT'S NOT MY CUP OF TEA AND I DON'T LIKE IT I DON'T CARE IF ANYONE ELSE LISTENS TO IT I JUST SIMPLY DON'T WANNA HEAR IT I HAVEN'T FOUND A BAND LIKE BEHEMOTH WHICH SOUNDS AWESOME THAT WASN'T ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF ANY SUGGESTIONS THE DEATH DOOM METAL BANDS I LISTEN TO ARE

CHILDREN OF BODO
OBITUARY
DEATH
MORBID ANGEL
DECAPITATED
WHITECHAPEL
ZOROASTER
HINDHAND
HEAVY LORD


OF THESE ARE THEY SUPER SATANIC EXCUSE THE SILLINESS OF THE QUESTION JUST WANTED TO GET A FEEL IF I'M BEING A HYPOCRITE OR IF THESE ARE JUST AS SATANIC AS STUFF LIKE BEHEMOTH AND GHOST BC

I SPONTANEOUSLY PICKED UP DOOMRIDERS BLACK THUNDER AND ACID TIGER SELF TITLED ON VINYL SCORED DOOMRIDERS FOR ON AMAZON LIMITED EDITION PURPLE SWIRL VINYL FOUND ACID TIGER ON DEATHWISH RECORDS SITE FOR BUCKINGHAMSHIRE I'M PRETTY STOKED AND WANTED TO SHARE ANY REALLY GOOD PLACES ONLINE TO FIND VINYL OBVIOUSLY EBAY OR GOING STRAIGHT TO THE RECORD COMPANY'S SITE BUT ANY ONE STOP SHOPS THAT HAVE A LOT OF METAL ALBUMS
DOES ANY METAL WITH A BARITONE OR BASS SINGER AS INTENSELY MANLY AS JAG CARDIAC ARREST EXIST

I DON'T THINK SO I'VE LOOKED PRETTY HARD FOR STUFF THAT'S QUITE THAT MANLY AND EVEN BANDS LIKE MANPOWER HEAVY LOAD IRONSWORD AND VICIOUS RUMORS CAN'T QUITE MEASURE UP
WHY ALL THE HATE FOR TRIVIUM
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE

OK GUYS SERIOUSLY WHY DOES NOBODY THINK ABOUT SONG LYRICS WHEN YOU ARE LISTENING

THIS SHIT IS BASIC PSYCHOLOGY AND LITERALLY NOBODY IS EVEN CONSIDERING THAT SONG LYRICS AND THEMES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOUR MIND CAN HOLD

IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO MUSIC AND THE MUSIC DOES NOT FEED YOUR BRAIN WHY THE HELL ARE YOU LISTENING TO IT

WHEN I LISTEN DO CERTAIN UNDERGROUND DEATH METAL BANDS I WILL LISTEN FOR THE MUSICAL TONES AND ERYTHEMAS THAT THEY PLAY IF THEY ADD LITERAILY NOTHING TO THE GENRE WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU LISTENING TO IT

INSTEAD GO CHECK OUT SOME SUPER SIDE PROJECT LIKE WORK SOMETHING LIKE ENSIFERUM ELUVEITIE NIGHTFISH ALVER ETC I MEAN SERIOUSLY GUYS WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU GET A FUCKING LIFE BASIC PSYCHOLOGY CAN TEACH YOU MORE THEN ANY COMPUTER PROGRAMING MORE THEN LITERALLY ANY OTHER THING WHY THE HELL DOES NOBODY TAKE PSYCHOLOGY

OK RANT OVER YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST


SIGNED BRINGER OF JUSTICE DESTROYER OF FATE NIGHT OF THE RISING SUN

IN THE BIBLE PSALMS LITERAILY WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THE WORLD GROW THE FUCK UP AND GET A FUCKING LIFE

PS I'M SERIOUS YOU GUYS HAVE NO ARGUMENT GET THE FUCK OVER YOURSELVES AND GET A REAL FUCKING LIFE
DELETED
PROBABLY JUST THE REALLY RINGY UNDERPRODUCED SNARE
CAN YOU PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE
IT'S PROBABLY THE HIGH TUNING LOTS OF REVERB FROM REVERB FILLED PRODUCTION
ARTY FOR ME
GREAT ALBUM BEEN LISTENING TO IT A LOT LATELY
KILLER RIFFS SOME GREAT SOLOS AND GREAT PRODUCTION BUT THE VOCALS JUST COMPLETELY KILL IT FOR ME I'M GOING TO BE GIVING IT A COUPLE MORE LISTENS IN THE HOPES THAT THEY WILL CLICK
THE GUYS IN THIS BAND ARE REAL JERKS
GREAT ALBUM
FUN FACT I MET A GUY AT CALIFORNIA DEATHFEST THIS YEAR WITH A SWEET MOLESTED SHIRT AND WHEN I COMPLIMENTED IT HE SHOWED ME THAT HE HAS ART TATTOOED ON HIS UPPER ARM WAS A PRETTY COOL DUDE GOTTA SAY
IF YOU REALLY HAVE A VOID IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU MUST FILL WITH STAR WARS THEMED METAL THERE'S ALWAYS HOTH
I AM GOING TO ASSUME THAT NOVELTY BANDS OR BANDS WITH A HEAVY CONCEPT ARE LESS ABLE TO KEEP IT TOGETHER
HERE'S RETURN OF THE JEDI LIVE


THE GUITAR DUDE SOUNDS LIKE JAKE E LEE AND RANDY RHOADS COMBINED IN ONE
AMAZING ALBUM IF YOU'RE SHORT ON CASH
ARE THESE GUYS DANISH OR NORWEGIAN PLAYING OUT OF COLORADO UNDERHANG MEANS APOCALYPSE OR DEMISE AND RADBRÆKKET MEANS SOMETHING LIKE BACK-BROKEN
OH I LIKE
REALLY COOL ALBUM AND YET SOMEHOW I KEEP FORGETTING ABOUT IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES ME GRAB OTHER RECORDS WHEN I'M IN THE MOOD FOR THIS KIND OF UBM
OLD-WORLD RULES AUTUMN IS THE SOUNDTRACK TO MY DIVORCE THOUGH
THIS ALBUM IS FUCKING OUTSTANDING PERFECT ATMOSPHERE FOR THE COLD WEATHER
I WAS ON A HOLIDAY IN SPAIN WHEN THIS CAME OUT AND IT DIDN'T REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT I TRIED IT THEN AND I LIKED A SONG OR TWO BUT AS AN ALBUM IT'S ATMOSPHERE TOTALLY FELL FLAT IN DEGREES ON A BEACH NOW WHILE READING THE TOPIC ON ALBUM OF THE WEEK BRAVE MURDER DAY I SUDDENLY REMEMBERED AUTUMN AND MY INTENTION TO REVISIT IT WHEN DAYS AND TEMPERATURES AMONG OTHER THINGS WOULD SHRINK AND MAN IT TOTALLY HITS ME NOW


I CAN'T SAY AUTUMN IS ANYTHING LIKE BRAVE MURDER DAY THE ATMOSPHERE ON AUTUMN IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MORE DERIVED FROM BURTRUM THAN THE SWEDISH MELODIC DEATH DOOM SCENE LIKE BOD BUT I THINK PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THAT LEGENDARY BEAUTIFUL KATATONIA RECORD WILL ENJOY THIS ONE TOO
THIS IS COOL BUT I DEFINITELY PREFER MELANCHOLY I ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE SNOW
THIS MUSIC SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE THRASH BLACK METAL I GET THAT THE VOCALS AND GENERAL MOOD OF THE MUSIC WOULD CALL IT BLACK METAL BUT IS ALL BLACK METAL THRASH LIKE THIS I'M TERRIBLE WITH GENRES I DO LIKE THRASH THOUGH

THIS MIGHT BE VERY OUT OF PLACE HERE SEEING AS IT'S NOT BLACK METAL AT ALL BUT THIS CAME TO MIND AND I FELT LIKE SHARING IT IN CASE OTHERS LIKE IT NOVEMBER'S DOOM AUTUMN REFLECTION
EW HETP
DEFINITELY DIGGING THIS ALBUM GOT THE CD BACK IN OCTOBER AND IT GOT A HANDFUL OF LISTENS IN THE CAR
YET TO FULLY DIG IN TO THIS ALBUM BUT I'VE ENJOYED MY FIRST FEW SPINS LOOK FORWARD TO AN LP VERSION THE ARTWORK LOOKED AWESOME ON THE CDS
I USED TO KNOW A GUY WHO'D GET UPSET WHEN I'D CALL THIS ALBUM IN DEATH OF SYLVESTER STALLONE SOLID ALBUM THOUGH HEAVY DEMONS IS MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE THOUGH
I WOULDN'T CALL THIS BLACK BUT PRETTY GOOD SONG
FUCK YEA DUDE ONE OF MY FAVORITE DEMOS
BEEN TRYING TO FIND A COPY OF THIS FOR A WHILE
LOL I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS RELEASE

FFA CARTOON TOW TRUCKS
SOUNDS GREAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DOWNVOTES
SOLID BAND EXCITED FOR THIS

DOPE ALBUM COVER
ONLY CANADIAN REVENGE IS REAL
ALDER IS TALENTED AS FUCK I'D LOVE SOME NEW MATERIAL
ALL THE BEST PARTS OF THE EARLY S ERA DIMMY BARGIR EVEN WITH NICHOLAS BARKER ON DRUMS HELL YEAH
ONE OF THE FIRST METAL CDS I BOUGHT I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BAND THE STYLE OF MUSIC THEY PLAYED ANYTHING I LIKED THE COVER ART AND FIGURED THAT WAS ENOUGH JUSTIFICATION
OLD MANS CHILD ARE ONE OF THE REASONS I STARTED TO LOVE BLACK METAL THEY'RE JUST AN EXCELLENT BAND
FIRST OME SONG I EVER HEARD IT WAS ON SOME CENTURY MEDIA COMPILATION PROMO CD I GOT WHENEVER THIS ALBUM DROPPED SUCH A GREAT SONG AND ALBUM ALDER IS ONE OF THE BEST RIFF WRITERS IN METAL IN MY OPINION CONSTANTLY CHURNING OUT GREAT SHIT

THE MILLENNIUM KING IN TORMENTS ORBIT BLACK MARVELS OF DEATH ENSLAVED AND CONDEMNED THE UNDERWORLD DOMAINS ALL HAVE INSANELY TASTY RIFFS AND MELODIES
I WISH THEY'D COME OUT WITH NEW STUFF
I TOTALLY FORGOT THIS ALBUM EXISTS
OME REALLY SHINES ON THE PAGAN PROSPERITY AND ILL-NATURED SPIRITUAL INVASION THIS ALBUM IS GOOD BUT THE SOUND STARTED MERGING WITH DIMMY BARGIR TOO MUCH FOR MY TASTE HERE I DO AGREE THOUGH THAT A NEW ALBUM IS LONG OVERDUE
NO ONE DESERVES HAPPINESS
GOOD STUFF ONE OF MY FAVORITES FROM THIS YEAR
THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS FUCKING AMAZING
WOW YOU NOW HAVE MY ATTENTION
CHECKING OUT THE FULL RELEASE NOW
DEFINITELY WILL FIND IT'S WAY INTO MY TOP FOR THE YEAR BEEN QUITE LUCKY AND HAVE GOTTEN TO SEE THESE GUYS LIVE TIMES IN ABOUT THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF

LOOKING FORWARD TO THEIR SHOW NEXT YEAR WITH ALCES DESPITE THE PAIRING BEING PRETTY ODD
YOU CAN'T DENY THAT TOOL HAS INFLUENCED METAL BANDS

I CAN DENY THAT THEY'VE HAD ANY SORT OF WIDESPREAD MEANINGFUL INFLUENCE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T
I WOULD ARGUE THAT BANDS LIKE SWANS HAD A LARGER INFLUENCE ON THE STRANGE EXPLORATORY BANDS I THINK IF YOU WENT TO A METAL FESTIVAL YOU WOULD SEE MORE SWANS SHIRTS THAN YOU WOULD TOOL

IF WE ARE TALKING INFLUENCE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A RANGE OF ALBUMS GOING FROM AT THAT POINT BLACK AND DEATH METAL WERE ALREADY IN FULL SWING AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN EVEN PROGRESSIVE METAL TOOK CUES FROM MESHUGGAH IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MUSICIANS PROBABLY GROWING UP WITH TOOL ALBUMS SURE BUT I THINK YOU ARE OVERSTATING THE IMPORTANCE
I LIKE THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT INFLUENTIAL OR GROUNDBREAKING

I SEEM TO RECALL THEM BEING FRIENDLY WITH THE KELVINS THOUGH WHO WERE SOMEWHAT INFLUENTIAL ALBEIT NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS WITHIN THE METAL GENRE
TOOL FALLS INTO A CATEGORY I LIKE TO CALL JOCK ROCK
DUDES I THINK WE ALWAYS OVERLOOK HOW STYLES HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO METAL
METAL HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY STALE FOR YEARS NOW IT'S REALLY DEAD IN TERMS OF INNOVATION

THANK DOG FOR SLAYER OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE NOTHING NEW TO LISTEN TO
I'M SORRY BUT IT'S NOT METAL IS IT I KNOW WHO THEY ARE BUT THIS DOESN'T BELONG HERE

ALSO WITH THAT ALBUM COVER I CAN ONLY THINK ABOUT DEVOTO
HAVE YOU HEARD THEIR NEW ALBUM
ONE OF QUITE A FEW COPT TUNES THAT ROCKED MY WORLD BACK IN THE DAY AND I STILL ENJOY THEM

SUZIE SMILED
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT HEARS A BIT OF BARRACUDA IN THIS
THIS IS SOME GOOD SHIT MANUAL
REALLY FUN LOCAL BAND THAT KILLS LIVE
THAT RIGHT HAND IS UNSTOPPABLE BOICE
THERE WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH ANSI IN MY LIFE
ELUM GETS A BAD RAP RIGHTLY SO MOST OF THE TIME BUT AGRA IS FUCKING GOOD SHIT
THIS IS MY SUMMER ALBUM I LOVE BLASTING THIS ALBUM IN MY CAR THE FIRST SOLID DAY OF SUMMER ONE OF MY IN THE GENRE
THERE IS A CHANCE IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO AN ALBUM MADE IN SWEDEN DURING THE S IT WAS PROBABLY ENGINEERED OR AT LEAST HAD A COUPLE OF KNOBS TURNED BY DAN SWAN YOU MAY NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT IT MAY EVEN BE BY ACCIDENT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT PRODUCTION CREDITS AND DAN SWAN APPEARS IN THE BACK OF AN OLD PHOTO FROM YEARS AGO OVER CREEPY MUSICBOX MELODIES OH SHIT THERE HE IS UP IN THE WINDOW HETP WHETHER YOU WANT HIM OR NOT HE APPEARS LIKE AN APPARITION FOR SECOND RELEASE ADD TO THIS A BAND THAT IS ALREADY FAMOUS FOR ITS LEAD SINGER ALSO DOING AN OBSCURE SIDE PROJECT CALLED JAPETH AND AN ALBUM COVER THAT LOOKS LIKE THE FINAL FROM A 1ST YEAR SAD PHOTOGRAPHY STUDENT AND YOU HAVE CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION IN A CEMETERY WITH A COUPLE OF YOUR FRIENDS WHO REALLY LIKE EDGAR ALLEN POE AND NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS

WARNING THIS AND THE FOLLOWUP EP SOUNDS OF DECAY ARE THE ONLY PROPER RELEASES WITH MIKAEL ÅKERFELDT AS A LEADING CONTRIBUTE DON'T GET EVEN MORE SAD

I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE USE FOR MELODIC DEATH DOOM CAN CAUSE PEOPLE TO GO INTO GENRE SEIZURES AND THINK EVERYTHING HAS DESCRIPTIONS LIKE DEATH DOOM ALONG WITH SATURNUS AND OCTOBER TIDE HAVE LITTLE TO DO AND PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET ALONG WITH THE TRADITIONAL DEATH DOOM LIKE WINTER AND AUTOPSY IF YOU WANTED THAT FENCE IN YOUR YARD OF DEATH DOOM IT IS ONLY INTENDED TO HELP AS SOUND IS DRAMATIC AND USES MELODIES TO CREATE ATMOSPHERE RATHER THAN ATTEMPTING TO PUMMEL WITH A GRAVESTONE

WHY ARE YOU LISTENING TO THIS TODAY WELL IF YOU LIVE IN THE STATES YOU ARE PROBABLY PLANNING A TRIP BACK TO SOME SORT OF FAMILY EPICENTER AND COMBINED WITH TRAFFIC THIS MAYBE THE PERFECT SOUNDTRACK TO YOU DAMN MISERABLE EXISTENCE I AM JUST JOKING HAVE CREAM CORN AND THAT SHIT IS DELICIOUS IT HAS BEEN FUCKING COLD HERE THE LAST FEW DAYS AND THE WIND HAS BEEN SOMETHING FIERCE I CAN NOT THINK OF A BETTER SOUNDTRACK TO CLUTCH ONTO MY JACKET AND SAY HOLY SHIT FUCK THIS

HOLY SHIT THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF YOU DOOM FANS MAYBE CRUEL TIDE DOOMCEMBER WILL BE A THING


THE VERSION OF BRAVE ON THE LAST FAIR DAY GONE NIGHT DVD IS FUCKING AWESOME
AS SOMEONE WHO LOVED ALL THAT DEATH DOOM FROM BACK IN THE DAY I JUST GOTTA ASK WHY DID THEY ALL VEER AWAY KATATONIA ANATHEMA AMORPHI I'D KILL FOR THEM ALL TO GO BACK TO THEIR ROOTS OR AT LEAST DO A TOUR TOGETHER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE OLDER STUFF

ALSO MAD PROPS TO THE ONLY BAND IN THE PIERCEVILLE THREE TO STAY TRUE TO THE ERA MY DYING BRIDE
PROBABLY IN MY TOP ALL TIME TOP ALL TIME GREATEST DEAD BIRD ALBUM COVERS QUITE POSSIBLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MY MOVE INTO EXTREME METAL AND MY DEEP LOVE OF THE COLOR PURPLE

EDIT LISTENING THOUGHTS

THE WHOLE TONE IS WHAT DREW ME TO IT LIKE WAKING UP HANGOVER ON AN OVERLY SUNNY SUMMER AFTERNOON SWEATING THROUGH THE SHEETS UNABLE TO BLOCK THE OUT THE LIGHT ITS INCESSANT WITH THAT COLLEGE RADIO PICKING

BRAVE MURDER DAY PREDICTS DSM AND COULD RIGHTFULLY BE CALLED SO WITH A BIT MORE REVERB AND A BIT LESS BASS

THE ON BRAVE GREETS YOU WITH A BOTTLE OF PILLS AND BEGS YOU TO KILL YOURSELF THE COLOR ON THE THIRD RIFF OUTDO RESONATES LIKE A MIGRAINE SUBTLY BURYING THE PIANO WHO WANTS TO COMMIT SUICIDE WITH ME

DAY IS THE BEST SONG EVER RECORDED THE AUDITORY EQUIVALENT OF CUTTING YOURSELF TO LIVE FUCK TRENT REASNOR

THE REAL STAR OF RAINPROOF COULD POSSIBLY BE THE BREAK BUT IT'S NOT IT'S THE SUBTLE MELODY UNDER THE MAIN RIFF PAY ATTENTION ASSHOLE

WE FINALLY GET A HEAD-HANGING MOMENT ON IT'S NOT QUITE WORTH IT AS THE QUIET PASSAGES AND MELODIES ARE WHAT CARRY THIS SONG PROBABLY MY LEAST FAVORITE TRACK ON THE ALBUM BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO TRY TOO HARD TO FORCE METAL INTO AN OTHERWISE PLEASANTLY DEPRESSING ALBUM THAT OUTDO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE EITHER IT NEVER DID WAS IT AN ABORTED 7TH TRACK WAS IT CONTRACTUALLY MANDATED

FOR SOME REASON I KEEP THINKING OF WHITE PONY MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I DISCOVERED THIS ALBUM AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT ONE WAS RELEASED MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY SHARE SIMILAR WARMTH

KATATONIA KINGS OF ALL THAT IS MELODIC IN METAL PREDICT BLACKGAZE WITH ENDTIME WHICH MAKES UP FOR THE FORCED NATURE OF BY BEING GENUINELY HEAVY BY DESIGN ALCES CAN SUCK A DICK BEIGE IS A CLOSET NAZI KATATONIA ARE HERE TO SAVE US ALL

ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF ENDTIME IS THAT EVEN TODAY I FULLY EXPECT JOHAN LÄNGQVIST TO SHOW UP OUT OF NOWHERE SOARING HIGH ON COOL WINGS OF SADNESS INSTEAD ÅKERFELDT LAYS A TRAIL OF BREAD-CRUMB FOR A REALIZATION THAT WE WOULD ONLY COME TO YEARS LATER JAPETH ISN'T METAL

FUCK I LOVE THIS ALBUM
I LISTEN TO KATATONIA ON A DAILY BASIS AND HAVE FOR A LONG TIME ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS STILL TODAY BUT THIS IS ONE OF THERE ONLY ALBUMS I'VE NEVER LISTENED TO ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND I'M NOT SURE WHY I'LL HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS MORE TODAY
THESE GUYS ARE COMING TO MY CITY IN JANUARY SHOULD I GO HOW ARE THEY LIVE
FINALLY AN ALBUM OF THE WEEK THAT I'VE HEARD BEFORE
LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES I THINK I PREFER DISCOURAGED ONES ANDERS NYSTRÖM IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GUITARISTS HE HAS A REALLY GREAT WAY OF WRITING MELODIES
I FIRST HEARD THIS ON THE LEGENDARY AT LEAST TO ME AND MY HOLIES FIRESTARTER COMPILATION FROM CENTURY BLACK WHICH HAD MURDER AS ONE OF THE TRACKS IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THERE I JUST LOVED THAT STEADY OPEN CHORD STRUMMING AND STEADY ROCK BEAT ON THE DRUMS DEFINITELY FORESHADOWING SOME OF THE MODERN AMBIENT BLACK METAL AND DSM IT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FIRST SONGS I EVER LEARNED ON DRUMS BACK WHEN I WAS LEARNING IN HIGH SCHOOL IT WASN'T UNTIL QUITE A BIT LATER THAT I HEARD THE WHOLE ALBUM BUT MURDER DEFINITELY STAYED MY FAVORITE TRACK EVEN IF IT WAS JUST A NOSTALGIA THING
YES

THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS OF ALL TIME SUCH SIMPLE INSTRUMENTATION THAT CONVEYS SUCH COMPLEX MOSTLY SAD MELANCHOLIC EMOTION THE MAIN RIFF ON MURDER EXEMPLIFIES THIS AND MIGHT BE MY FAVORITE RIFF OF ALL TIME INTERESTING HOW THE DRONING MELODIES AND RHYTHMS ARE REITERATED ACROSS DIFFERENT SONGS WITHOUT COMING OFF AS REPETITIVE ACCOSTING SECTIONS ARE DONE SO WELL TOO ESPECIALLY ON RAINPROOF WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL RIFF THAT EVENTUALLY GETS DROWNED OUT BY THE WAVES OF DISTORTION BUT DROWNED PEACEFULLY WILLINGLY EVEN ALONG THE CHANTING VOCALS

AND OF COURSE THE MELODIES ANYONE WHO'S LISTENED TO THIS KNOWS THE ONE ON ENDTIME I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE THE FEELING I GET FROM MELODIES LIKE THIS AND BRAVE MURDER DAY IN GENERAL BUT I REALLY CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT A CALM SERENE SADNESS THAT SLOWLY CONSUMES IS THERE HINTS OF ANGER OR ACCEPTANCE A LONGING NOSTALGIA FOR SOMEONE OR SOMETHING MAYBE EVEN HOMESICKNESS THE FEELING OF NO CONTROL

DON'T THINK I'LL EVER STOP LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM

I CAN'T BELIEVE I NEVER KNEW THAT AKERFELDT ON THIS
THANKS FOR REMINDING ME TO LISTEN TO MORE KATATONIA ACTUALLY SINCE THIS ALBUM IS AROUND MY IDEAL LENGTH I'M GOING TO LISTEN TO IT RIGHT NOW
THIS IS ONE MY FAVORITE PERFORMANCES FROM MIKAEL AKERFELDT I LOVE THE JAPETH ALBUMS TO DEATH BUT HIS VOCALS AT THE TIME REALLY LENT THEMSELVES WELL TO VERY SAD MELANCHOLIC MUSIC I'D ONLY REALLY DESCRIBE MORNINGRISE AS SAD SO THIS ALBUM SCRATCHES THAT ITCH PERFECTLY ALSO THE GUITAR TONE ON THIS ALBUM IS ABSOLUTELY KILLER YOU JUST KNOW IT'S SWEDISH
DELETED
I HAVE THE CENTURY BLACK VERSION FROM AND IT'S ACTUALLY GOT THE ENTIRETY OF FOR FUNERALS TO COME AS BONUS TRACKS AND IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY MARKED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO BUT IT'S STILL AN ENJOYABLE BONUS TO HAVE ALWAYS FELT THIS WAS STRONGER THAN SOUNDS OF DECAY
BOD IS EASILY IN MY TOP ALBUMS OF ALL TIME I EVEN DID A COVER OF RAINPROOF WITH A FRIEND JUST BECAUSE I LOVED THEM SO MUCH
WATCH V LQIXIPO

SAD THAT I'VE ONLY SEEN KATATONIA ONCE AND I DON'T REMEMBER THEM PLAYING ANY BOD MATERIAL THE TONE AND FEEL IS JUST PERFECT GREAT MUSIC TO BLAST IN THE WINTER
BEEN AWHILE FOR AWHILE SUPPOSE I SHOULD EASE BACK IN WITH THE ALBUM OF THE WEEK

I WAS A BIT HESITANT ABOUT GIVING THIS A LISTEN I'M NOT THE BIGGEST FAN OF WHAT I'VE HEARD OF DEATH DOOM ADMITTEDLY LITTLE AND I USUALLY STAY AWAY FROM MOST STUFF MARKED MELODIC DON'T KNOW WHY HOWEVER I FIGURED THAT IT'D BE GOOD TO TRY SOMETHING THAT I DON'T NORMALLY GIVE A LISTEN TO

SO OVERALL THIS RECORD IS PRETTY DANG GOOD THE GUITAR TONE IS GOOD WITH ENOUGH OF A BITE TO GIVE IT A DEATH METAL SOUND WHILE STILL SOUNDING UNIQUE AGAINST OTHER S DEATH BANDS THE BASS WHICH I CAN HEAR SWEET DOESN'T GO FOR MUCH IN THE FLASHINESS DEPARTMENT BUT IT PROVIDES A CONSISTENT BACKBONE TO THE SOUND ALONG WITH THE DRUMS THE DRUMS SIMILARLY AREN'T VERY FLASHY BUT THEY GET THE JOB DONE WITH ENOUGH FILLS AND CHANGES TO KEEP THINGS INTERESTING THE KEYBOARDS ARE USED VERY WELL ADDING NICE TEXTURE TO THE TRACKS FINALLY THE VOCALS ON THIS RECORD ARE TREMENDOUS WHILE NOT MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME THEY ARE WELL-VARIED WITH PLENTY OF FORCE BEHIND THEM THEY REALLY CAPTURE THE MOOD OF THE ALBUM AT LEAST FOR ME WHICH IS WHAT I ALWAYS LOOK FOR IN AN ALBUM INCIDENTALLY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER LISTENED TO JAPETH NOT SURPRISED THAT PEOPLE WERE UNHAPPY WITH AKERFELDT SWITCHING TO CLEAN SINGING ONLY DAMN FINE GROWLS FROM HIM ON THIS RECORD

HIGHLIGHTS

MURDER THAT INTRO RIFF

RAINPROOF



AND WORTH MENTIONING DAY REALLY THREW ME FOR A LOOP NOT IN A BAD WAY MIND YOU BUT CERTAINLY ODD

I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO GIVE THIS RECORD MORE LISTENS MORE THAN ANYHOW TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT I ENJOY IT BUT FOR NOW IT'S PRETTY DANG GOOD
I LOVE THIS ALBUM PERFECT FOR THE RAINY SEASON
I WOULD CALL MYSELF A KATATONIA HARDCORE FAN BUYING EVERY RECORD WITH THE NAME KATATONIA WAITING AND STANDING IN FRONT OF VENUES FOR HOURS JUST FOR FIRST ROW AND SO ON

AND I IGNORED BRAVE MURDER DAY FOR SO MANY YEARS I COULDN'T SEE HOW THIS IS ANY GOOD OUTPUT IN COMPARISON TO ALBUMS LIKE THE GREAT COLD DISTANCE OR DEAD END KINGS FINALLY I GAVE IT A SHOT AND DEAR GOD SINCE THIS DAY I ADMIRE THIS PIECE OF MUSIC ONE OF THEIR BEST ALBUMS OVERALL AND I WOULD KILL TO HEAR BRAVE LIVE
FUCK YES
SO FUCKING GOOD
THIS IS ANOTHER NICE FIND THANKS

UNCHARACTERISTICALLY I'M ACTUALLY FINDING THE TRACK DAY THE LEAST INTERESTING HERE IF I WANTED TO LISTEN TO THE CURE OR THE JOY DIVISION I WOULD BRAVE HOWEVER IS BRILLIANT AND THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS PRETTY GOOD TOO
BEST SHOEGAZE ALBUM
THE ATMOSPHERE ON THIS ALBUM IS UNREAL IT'S LIKE BEING TRAPPED IN A NIGHTMARE ANXIETY AND APPREHENSION SWIRLING AROUND YOU INCESSANTLY AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A MELANCHOLY BEAUTY TO IT ALL IT'S ODDLY COMFORTING TO BE TRAPPED IN THE DEPTHS OF THIS ALBUM I FUCKING LOVE KATATONIA AND THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES JUST BELOW DISCOURAGED ONES
THIS IS AN AMAZING ALBUM I COULD LISTEN TO THE RIFF FROM BRAVE FOREVER IT'S HYPNOTIC

I NEVER REALLY MANAGED TO GET INTO ANYTHING THEY DID AFTER BOD A BIT TOO CURE CROSS BAD ADB FOR ME

GUESS I KNOW WHAT I'M LISTENING TO TONIGHT NOW

ALSO OBLIGATORY
GOT THIS ALBUM WHEN IT WAS RELEASED I NOW FEEL OLD STILL ONE OF MY AVES JUST THE ATMOSPHERE AND RAW FEELING THEY MANAGED TO CAPTURE WITH THIS ALBUM IS PHENOMENAL

EVEN NOW WHEN IT'S A REALLY COLD OVERCAST DAY I'LL GET LYRICS OF DAY GOING THROUGH MY HEAD
I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM LIKE TIMES IN A ROW LAST NIGHT I HAD NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE I WOKE UP SUICIDAL SO THAT'S COOL
HEY AN AOW THAT IS GOOD AND NOT DAD ROCK
SMIRKS



YOU POOR WEAK SPINELESS FOOLS OH HOW I PITY THEE TO THINK YOU KNOW GOOD QUALITY MUSIC AND YET I ENVY YOU HAVING MINDS SO BASE AND PRIMAL THAT YOU LACK THE DIFFICULTIES OF AN INTELLECTUAL LIKE ME IT IS HARD EVEN FOR SOMEONE AS INTELLIGENT AS ME TO IMAGINE LISTENING TO SCOFFS BRAVE MURDER DAY OVER HIGHER QUALITY DEATH-DOOM LIKE MY DYING LINE OF DEATHLESS KINGS OR THE REALM OF DEATH TRULY TRULY PATHETIC TELL ME FLEAS DO YOUR FEEBLE MINDS HAVE TO CONSTANTLY FOCUS ON BREATHING LEST YOU FORGET AND SUFFOCATE ON YOUR OWN STUPIDITY ONE LOOK AT YOUR MUSICAL TASTES AND I WOULD BELIEVE THAT TO BE THE CASE



NOW THIS IS THE LAST TIME I WILL CONVERSE WITH YOU CRITTERS BUT I IMPLORE YOU LEAVE THIS SUBREDDIT R METAL IS MEANT FOR TRUE METAL CONNOISSEURS WHO ENJOY THE SUBTLE MELODIES OF DRACONIAN AND PARADISE LOST AND THOU AND BLIND GUARDIAN KEEP LISTENING TO YOUR DISGUSTING MUSIC FOOLS BUT PLEASE DON'T INFEST MY SUBREDDIT WITH YOUR LACK OF TASTE WITH THAT I LEAVE YOU HEATHEN



DEPARTS WITH A TANGIBLE AIR OF TRIUMPH
I CAN'T SAY I'M A MASSIVE FAN OF THIS STYLE BUT KATATONIA DOES A GREAT JOB HERE FOR ME THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE CURE CIRCA PORNOGRAPHY MIXED WITH DEATH METAL MIKAEL VOCALS PERFECTLY CONVEY THE FEELING OF SORROW AND DESPAIR THAT RINGS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ALBUM THE KIND OF ALBUM YOU PLAY WHILE WALKING ON A DREARY RAINY DAY

I STILL GET CHILLS LISTENING TO ENDTIME PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE TRACK OFF THE RECORD AND A BEAST OF A CLOSER AS IT PERFECTLY ENCAPSULATES THE BLEAK AND MELANCHOLIC TONE THEY SET OUT TO ACHIEVE LOVE THE SHINING SAMPLE AS WELL
GOOD ALBUM I NEED TO HIT IT AGAIN

OKAY NOW FOR THE REASON I'M COMMENTING IT'S OFF TOPIC BUT I'M NOT WAITING TIL THE NEXT GENERAL THREAD HOLY SHIT U UNANIMATEDFELIX DELETED HIS ACCOUNT ANYONE KNOW WHY I NEVER TALKED TO THE GUY REALLY BUT HIS WAS A NAME I ALWAYS RECOGNIZED FAVORABLY
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT DANCE OF DECEMBER SOULS IS BETTER BRAVE MURDER DAY IS WEIRD BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST TO ME I DON'T LISTEN TO THE MUSIC AS MUCH AS I END UP THINKING THROUGH IT


WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY MAY TRIGGER SOME PEOPLE

HONESTLY AS MUCH AS I LOVE KATATONIA I FEEL LIKE THIS RECORD IS SO HYPED AND JERKED BECAUSE OF CRESCENCE I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT THIS RECORD WOULD BE OVER LOOKED BY A LARGER AUDIENCE IF HE DIDN'T DO THE VOCALS BUT BECAUSE HE DID YOU HAVE YOUR R PROTOMETAL FANBOYS LEAKING OVER IT BECAME AKERFELDT ADMITTEDLY WHEN I DO THINK OF THIS I GET UNNECESSARILY ANGERED BY IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S HYPOTHETICAL
THE RELEASE THAT FUNDAMENTALLY SHIFTED AVANTGARDE MUSIC


DAM WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ALBUM
MAN WHENEVER I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO LISTEN TO I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON THIS SUB FOR SOME LEGITIMATELY GOOD STUFF I HAVENT HEARD BEFORE THANKS
YEAH I LOVE THIS ALBUM THEY REALLY HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL HERE

NOT DEATH METAL THOUGH FIGHT ME
ON ANY GIVEN DAY OF THE WEEK IF YOU ASKED ME WHAT MY FAVORITE ALBUM IS I'D OFFER UP BRAVE MURDER DAY THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT

I BOUGHT THIS WHEN I WAS IN 9TH GRADE I THINK IT WAS A BLIND PURCHASE BUT SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME THE SINGER FROM JAPETH WAS ON IT AND I WAS A BIG FAN OF MORNINGRISE AND MY ARMS YOUR HEARSE AT THAT TIME IT TOOK SOME TIME TO GROW ON ME BUT NOW WELL AS MENTIONED IT'S PROBABLY MY FAVORITE ALBUM IT'S INFLUENCED EVERY PIECE OF MUSIC I'VE WRITTEN

THEY WEREN'T EVEN REALLY TRYING TO DO A METAL THING AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY WERE LISTENING MOSTLY TO SLOWDIVE WHEN THEY RECORDED THIS AN ORIGINAL MEMBER WANTED TO BRING THE BAND IN A MORE GOTHIC DIRECTION AND ANOTHER MEMBER SORRY I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH WAS WHICH WANTED TO GO IN THIS MORE SHOEGAZEY DIRECTION I THINK THEY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE I CAN'T GET INTO ANYTHING ELSE THEY DID AFTER THIS BESIDES THE EP THAT CAME OUT AROUND THE SAME TIME BUT THIS IS THEIR ABSOLUTE PEAK TO ME
I'M A FAN OF SLOW ATMOSPHERIC STUFF LOTS OF DOOM AND BLACK METAL WITHOUT MANY RIFFS MORE TO GET LOST IN BUT THIS STYLE DOES NOTHING FOR ME THE STANDOUT TRACK ON THIS IS DAY BASICALLY THE CURE TRACK THE REST OF IT IS PRETTY CAMEY AND STANDARD I DON'T GET THE DRAW
ALWAYS LIKED THIS ALBUM IT'S COOL AS HELL TRACES OF EDGE OF SANITY CAN BE HEARD UNSURPRISINGLY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY ITS OWN BEAST
THIS IS A REALLY UNIQUE ALBUM BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH A HUGE KEYBOARD PRESENCE SHIT IS CATCHY
IF RUSH MADE DEATH MEAL IN THE
NEVER HEARD OF THEM I'LL BE CHECKING THIS ALBUM OUT TODAY THANKS
TO THIS DAY STILL THEIR 2ND BEST TRACK THOSE OF THE NIGHT

MY JAW HIT THE FLOOR THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THIS ALBUM ALMOST YEARS AGO PROBABLY ONE OF THE ALBUMS I STILL LISTEN TO WEEKLY NO MATTER WHAT I GUESS THAT MEANS I'VE LISTENED TO IT ABOUT TIMES NOW WOW



IT TOOK ME SO MANY TRIES TO GET PAST THE VOCALS BUT ONCE I DID I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD FINALLY APPRECIATE THESE GUYS RECENTLY BINGED BEFORE THE NEW ALBUM AND BOUGHT ALL THEIR AS WELL AS THE BOX SET OF THE NEW ALBUM GOING TO BE SEEING THEM IN JANUARY SO STOKED
DAMN THIS IS SOME GOOD BLACK METAL
FOR FANS OF COSMIC FROGS KILLED ME
HMM COOL I DISCOVERED THIS BAND FROM THEIR NEW ALBUM INTERESTING TO HEAR THEIR ROOTS I'M SURPRISED AT HOW CLOSE THEY STICK TO THEM
THIS BAND LIVE HOLY SHIT DAGON IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE SICKEST FRONTSMAN I KNOW OF I DONT THINK I SAW HIM LOOK AT HIS GUITAR A SINGLE TIME DURING THE ENTIRE SHOW INSANE AMOUNT IF SKILL AND THE FACT THAT THE ENTIRE BAND IS 2 PEOPLE
LOVE HIS VOICE I NEED TO CHECK OUT MORE JAPANESE METAL
I'M TEMPTED TO GET IT BECAUSE I LOVE SUBSCRIPTION BOXES BUT I'M ONLY GETTING LEGION OF COLLECTORS AT THE MOMENT BUT THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS BOX

IF I'M A DEATH METAL FAN THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M A FAN OF ALL DEATH METAL I WOULDN'T WEAR A MAYHEM OR CHILDREN OF BODO SHIRT BECAUSE I LIKE A FEW SONGS BY BOTH BANDS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO WARRANT WEARING A SHIRT FOR THEM THE POSTERS ARE THE SAME PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH I WOULD HANG UP THAT MEGADEATH POSTER WHO KNOWS WHATS NEXT

AND THEN THE CDS IF YOU FIND A NEW CD YOU LOVE THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TO RECEIVE IN THE MAIL IF IT TURNS OUT YOU DON'T LIKE THE MUSIC THEN YOU'RE STUCK WITH A BAD CD WITH VERY LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR RESALE

I REALIZE THE WHOLE POINT OF MYSTERY BOXES IS WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU'LL GET BUT MOST OTHER BOXES GIVE YOU A THEME OR SOMETHING LIKE LEGION OF COLLECTORS IF THE THEME IS GREEN LANTERN CORPS I LIKE THE GREEN LANTERN CORPS SO WHATEVER MERCH I GET I KNOW I WILL ENJOY TO SOME DEGREE IF IT'S A JIMMY OLSEN BOX I KNOW I WON'T WANT IT SO I'LL SKIP OUT THAT BOX WITH THE METALHEAD BOX IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANNOUNCE THE BANDS THAT WILL BE REPRESENTED WITHOUT SPOILING THE BOX MAYBE A LABEL ANNOUNCEMENT I DON'T KNOW

BOX ASIDE THOUGH THIS UNBOXING WAS PAINFULLY LONG THESE THINGS SHOULD TAKE THREE MINUTES I DON'T WANT TO SIT THROUGH ALL OF THIS EVEN ON SPEED
ON MOBILE CAN'T WATCH WHAT'D YOU GET
NOT TOO BAD CERTAINLY WORTH THE
I REALLY WISH I COULD FIND A COPY OF THIS LP IT'S SO WEIRD AND GOOD
SAW THESE FOLK SEVERAL TIMES YEARS AGO BRINGS ME BACK FUN BAND
I CANT REMEMBER HOW I FOUND THIS BAND ALL THOSE YEARS AGO BUT IT WAS SUCH A GOOD FIND
MAN I NEED TO VENT ABOUT SOMETHING AND THIS POST IS THE ONLY THING RELATED ENOUGH SO I'M VENTING HERE

I HAD A CUSTOMER THE OTHER WEEK TELL ME THAT FUCKING BODYCOUNT WAS THE FIRST BLACK METAL BAND BECAUSE WAS IN IT I TRIED TO CORRECT HIM BUT HE JUST NODDED SMILED AND SAID YEAH BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS BAND THAT STARTED THE TREND BECAUSE THEY HAD THIS HEAVY METAL BUT IT WAS A BUNCH OF BLACK GUYS AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO CALL IT

VARIATIONS OF THIS CONVERSATION WENT ON FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR IT WAS THEN THAT I GAVE UP IT WAS A PRETTY MILD CONVERSATION BECAUSE I'M NOT ONE TO ARGUE MAYBE IT WAS HIS PERSONA GUY LOOKED ABOUT FIFTY KNEW A DECENT AMOUNT ABOUT MUSIC COMPARED TO THE USUAL CROWD THAT COMES IN HE WAS JUST SO SURE ABOUT THE BODY COUNT THING THOUGH THE NERD INSIDE ME SCREAMED
I WOULD LOVE IT IF THE BLACK METAL TREND WOULD END BECAUSE THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE TO READ SHITTY ARTICLES ABOUT DEAFHEAVEN BEING THE GREATEST MOST INNOVATIVE BAND EVER THAT IS SAVING BLACK METAL IF PEOPLE LIKE THAT STUFF THAT'S FINE I DON'T AND I DON'T REALLY THINK OF IT AS BLACK METAL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T EVOKE THE SAME FEELING I GET FROM MORE TRADITIONAL BANDS I'M JUST TIRED OF TOURISTS ACTING LIKE THEY KNOW SHIT ABOUT BLACK METAL OR METAL IN GENERAL
AS A WAY TO INSTANTLY TAG THEMSELVES OR THEIR NEW FAVORITES WITH A SPURIOUS AND LARGELY UNEARNED SENSE OF UNDERGROUND CREDIBILITY

I VE ALREADY SEEN CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO ONCE SPENT THEIR TIME PRAISING BLACK METAL FOR ITS MORE PHILOSOPHICAL AND OCCULT LEANINGS SUDDENLY PULLING AN ABRUPT ABOUT-FACE AND STARTING TO MOCK THE MORE SPIRITUAL OR PHILOSOPHICAL ELEMENTS OF THE STYLE BECAUSE IT S NOT COOL ANYMORE

DO THESE THINGS REALLY HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF HIGH SCHOOL KIDS TRYING TO LOOK COOL AND IF THEY DO WHO CARES WHY CAN'T WE JUST SAY SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING FADDISH AND SHALLOW THAT'S NOT NEWS
THE MOMENT THAT BLACK METAL STARTED TOLERATING BANDS EXPERIMENTING IN WHAT IS LARGELY THE REALM ETHOS AND AESTHETICS OF WEEPY AND WIMPY TEENAGERS EMO GAZE POST ETC IT WAS FOR THE STUPIDITY THE ARTICLE IS COMPLAINING ABOUT IT JUST TOOK ABOUT YEARS TO ACTUALLY GET HERE IRONICALLY ENOUGH THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS A LOT OF COUNTERPOINT BANDS THAT ARE SIMPLY COOL INSIDE THE SCENE BECAUSE THEY SIT ON THE METAPHORICAL SADDLE POINT BETWEEN OLD SCHOOL AND MODERN RENDITIONS OF OLD SCHOOL BM AND THIS CRAPPY BM IN THE OTHER DIRECTIONS ON THE SADDLE OF COURSE YOU HAVE YOUR TRUE AVANT-GARDE FUSION OFFERINGS AND THEN THE TRIED AND TRUE HYBRIDS LIKE BLACK THRASH INDUSTRIAL BM ETC UNFORTUNATELY JUST LIKE HOW IN THE S YOU HAD IDIOTS WHO ASKED YOU YOU LIKE METAL TOO MY FAVORITE BAND IS ATT SIMILARLY FOR KORN ETC IN THE LATE NOW YOU HAVE THIS THE INFIGHTING AND STALE FACTOR AMONGST FANS AND TRUE LIFER ENTHUSIASTS LED TO AN APATHY FOR CORRECT LABELING THEN JUST AS NOW AND HERE WE ARE COME HALF CIRCLE I GUESS IN MORE YEARS WE'LL HAVE COME BACK TO A DEBATE OVER METAL VS NON-METAL
WILL WE EVER LEARN THAT THE SOLUTION IS TO STRIVE FOR INTELLECTUAL NOT NECESSARILY IDEOLOGICAL PURITY IF SO THE MUSIC WILL WORK ITSELF OUT


A SACK FULL OF WEASELS HAVING IN A STEEL DRUM

I NOW HAVE A NEW WAY OF DESCRIBING THE SOUND OF ALL MY FAVORITE BANDS NORMALLY I JUST TELL PEOPLE THAT BLACK METAL SOUNDS LIKE A CAT GOING THROUGH A
PRETTY SURE BLACK METAL IS BLACK METAL AND BLACKGAZE POSTBLACK METAL BLACK N ROLL BLACKENED DEATH METAL DEATHCORE ETC ARE NOT BLACK METAL DON'T REALLY SEE AN ISSUE WITH IT

OF COURSE YOU CAN MAKE ARGUMENTS THAT THESE ARE OF BLACK METAL BUT THEY REALLY AREN'T YOU CAN VERY CLEARLY BE INFLUENCED BY BLACK METAL BUT IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T MAKE IT A SUBGENRE OF BLACK METAL I'D STILL SAY THERE IS ROOM FOR SUBGENRE IN BLACK METAL SUCH AS AVANT-GARDE FOLK VIKING ATMOSPHERIC PROGRESSIVE AND EVEN SOME REALLY PUNK INFLUENCED STUFF CAN STILL BE COUNTED AS BLACK METAL

STILL WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT GENRE INFUSIONS ARE JUST AS OLD AS GENRES THEMSELVES SO WE SHOULDN'T CONFUSE GENRE INFUSIONS WITH SUBGENRE

FROM THE ARTICLE

BUT THAT BEING SAID I AM VERY WARY OF AN UNPLEASANT TREND WHICH I VE OBSERVED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WHERE ANYTHING WITH EVEN THE TINIEST AMOUNT OF TREMOLO PICKING OR HARSH VOCALS SEEMS TO BE LABELLED AS BLACK METAL WITHOUT ANY REGARDS FOR WHETHER THIS IS AN ACCURATE OR APPROPRIATE REFLECTION OF THE BAND IN QUESTION

I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS A PROBLEM THERE ARE FAR MORE PEOPLE WITH NO IDEA OF BLACK METAL IN THIS WORLD THAN THOSE WHO HAVE AN IDEA IT'S VERY OBVIOUS THAT EVERYTHING WE HEAR ABOUT BLACK METAL ISN'T ACCURATE SO STATEMENTS ON IF SOMETHING IS OR ISN'T BLACK METAL REALLY SHOULD NEVER BE HELD AT FACE VALUE INDEED IT SOUNDS PREPOSTEROUS DAE GHOST B COUNTY IS BLACK METAL OBVIOUSLY GHOST ISN'T BLACK METAL AND HAS NO ASSOCIATION AND EVEN IF I SAY IT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT SO MY STATEMENT SHOULD JUST BE IGNORED

ONE BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS ISSUE IS THAT THE TERM BLACK METAL SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME A BIT OF A FOR CERTAIN BANDS AND CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THE MUSIC PRESS

WELL FUCK THE PRESS THEN MUSIC PRESS ISN'T THE WORST IN THE WORLD BUT THEY'RE NOT INFALLIBLE MOST MAINSTREAM PUBLICATIONS DEFINITELY LACK THE KNOWLEDGE OF BLACK METAL EVEN IF THEY DEAL WITH METAL EVERY DAY LOOKING AT YOU METALCUCKS NO REASON TO TAKE ANYTHING THEY SAY WITH FACE VALUE BUT OF COURSE IF THEIR REASONING IS GOOD ENOUGH THEN SURE WE'LL LISTEN

BUT THAT DOESN T MEAN THAT EVERY TAM DICK AND AHRIMAN WHO OWNS AN EMPEROR ALBUM OR A WOLVES IN THE THRONE ROOM SHIRT HAS A RIGHT TO CALL THEIR MUSIC BLACK METAL JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM SOUND COOL

AGAIN THE AUTHOR CLEARLY HAS A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE CALLING SOMETHING BLACK METAL IT'S NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEIR WORDS ARE USELESS

IT S ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT I VE SEEN AND HEARD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE MAKING THE CLAIM THAT BLACK METAL S RECENT CROSSOVER WITH BOTH HARDCORE AND MEANS THAT BLACK METAL IS FINALLY GOOD NOW

WELL BLACK METAL INFLUENCES BEING BROUGHT TO THESE OTHER GENRES MIGHT DEFINITELY BE EXACTLY WHAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN YEARNING FOR UNAPOLOGETIC HIGH TEMPO VERSION OF A GENRE THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN LISTENING TO THAT STILL DOESN'T TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM SUCH MUSIC AND IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T MAKE IT BLACK METAL

MY POINT HERE SIMPLY IS THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF BANDS THINK THEY'RE THE SVELTEST OF BLACK METAL OR LABELS THINK THAT FANS THINK THAT OR SOMEONE ON THE INTERNET THINKS THAT IT'S JUST THEIR OPINION AND IT HOLDS NO VALUE EARTH USED TO BE THOUGHT TO BE SOLID SOME PEOPLE STILL DON'T BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND MANY PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE IN RELIGION THEY BELIEVE THESE THINGS EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BASIS IN FACTS OR REALITY IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER SINCE IT WON'T TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THE REALITY IT WON'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL IDEAS THAT ARE BASED ON FUNDAMENTALS THAT SIMPLY CANNOT BE SWAYED

SO WHATEVER THOSE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE MORE WIDELY MISUNDERSTOOD AND MISLABELED MIGHT HAVE SOME REAL WORLD IMPLICATIONS BUT REAL BLACK METAL WILL NEVER BE WORSE JUST BECAUSE SOME VVIMPS AND FALCES MISUNDERSTAND IT


THE TITLE MADE ME THINK I MISTAKENLY STUMBLED INTO R SHITTHEFALSESAY
REASONS LIKE THIS IS WHY I DON'T PUT MUCH MENTAL ENERGY INTO I LIKE THE MUSIC TO SPEAK FOR ITSELF OFTEN I FIND SUBGENRE IS JUST AN ASSOCIATION THAT IS UNRELATED TO THE MUSIC ITSELF U SOYBEANEXPLOSION MAKES A GOOD POINT THAT MANY OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BLACK METAL ARTISTS CONSIDER THE LABEL TO MEAN MORE THAN JUST THE MUSIC I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SAID IT BUT ONE OF THE OLD-SCHOOL DUDES BELIEVES BLACK METAL MUST BE SATANIC SUBGENRE CAN STILL BE HELPFUL IN LINKING IDEAS AND TASTES BUT I FIND THERE'S TOO MUCH BAGGAGE THAT COMES WITH THEM
EDIT FIXING AUTOCORRECTS
IT S ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT I VE SEEN AND HEARD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE MAKING THE CLAIM THAT BLACK METAL S RECENT CROSSOVER WITH BOTH HARDCORE AND MEANS THAT BLACK METAL IS FINALLY GOOD NOW

AND BY INTERESTING I MEAN INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING

I'M SO GLAD THAT I MISSED THE ENTIRE CRITIC OVER DEAFHEAVEN AND THE SUBSEQUENT REACTION TO IT BECAUSE I NOW I CAN JUST LISTEN TO THE BAND AND ENJOY THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE

OH NO OH NO OH NO OH ITS NOT THAT BAD I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE SOMEONE CALLING ME OUT FOR SOMETHING I HAVEN'T DONE IT IS AN INTERESTING ARTICLE ON THE USE OF THE WORD BLACK METAL AND PROBABLY THE COGNITIVE DISSONANCE WHEN ONE COMES INTO THE GENRE FROM THE FRINGE GENRES AND THEN LISTENS TO BATORY ROOT DARKTHRONE OR OLD ROTTING CHRIST
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THERE WILL EVER BE AGREEMENT ON I THINK AS A GENRE BLACK METAL IS PARTICULARLY OPEN TO VERY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT IT REALLY JUST COMES DOWN TO CERTAIN MUSICAL CHARACTERISTICS USE OF FAST TEMPOS SHRIEKED VOCALS FAST GUITAR PASSAGES RAW PRODUCTION ETC

BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO MANY OF THE ARTISTS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HUGELY INFLUENTIAL ON BLACK METAL SUCH AS BURTRUM MAYHEM DISSECTION OR MORE RECENTLY WATKIN ARGUABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST BLACK METAL BANDS ON THE PLANET THEY SEE IT AS BEING MUCH MORE THAN JUST THAT IT'S ALSO ABOUT WHAT DRIVES YOU THE TOPICS YOU'RE FOCUSING ON LYRICALLY AND MUSICALLY YOUR SOURCES OF INSPIRATION YOUR IDEOLOGY RELIGIOUS VIEWS ETC FOR SOME IT'S SATANISM FOR OTHERS IT'S PAGANISM OR A REVERENCE OF SOME PARTICULAR CULTURE OR HISTORY ETC

ON THIS VIEW BLACK METAL IS A MUCH MORE ALL-ENCOMPASSING TERM AND IN THAT SENSE IT'S MUCH MORE DEMANDING IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT YOU PLAY THE MIMIC THE STYLE AND HONESTLY I KIND OF THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THAT IT'S SOMETHING I'M GOING TO THINK ABOUT FURTHER BUT IF YOU'RE PLAYING A BLACK METAL STYLE OF MUSIC WHILE YOUR VOCALIST IS TELLING THE AUDIENCE ABOUT GOD'S ENDLESS LOVE AND FORGIVENESS I DON'T KNOW DUDE I QUESTION WHETHER YOU'RE PLAYING BLACK METAL OR JUST USING THE AESTHETIC
LOL
WELL THERE SURE IS A LOT OF TARVE IN THIS THREAD

IS THIS WHAT I HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO NOW THAT I'VE BEEN GETTING INTO BLACK METAL
BRUSLY WHO THE FUCK CARES WHAT'S A BAND CATEGORIZED AS YOU COULD CALL OLD-WORLD OR SERABEND IT'D BE STILL AWESOME
AND THE CLEAN VOCALS ON SOME ALBUMS TRACKS ARE GREAT AND GIVE SO MUCH TO THE SONG EXAMPLE AUSTERE TO LAY LIKE OLD ASHES ALBUM
YASS I HAVE THE TAPE OF THIS HOPING THAT NEW EP DROPS RELATIVELY SOON
HEARING HAWK AS WEAPON LIVE WAS ONE OF THE BETTER EXPERIENCES OF PSYCHO CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR
I WAS EXPECTING POWER METAL
WE GOT TO CHATTING AFTER THE SHOW AND MATT PIKE TURNED TO ME AND SAID WHAT DO YOU TUNE TO SO I EXPLAINED THAT WE TUNE TO AND HE SAID OH MY GOD WE WATCHED YOU FROM THE SIDE OF THE STAGE AND I HAD TO GO AND HAVE A SHIT IT WAS SO HEAVY AND I WAS LIKE OKAY THAT IS PROBABLY THE COOLEST COMPLIMENT EVER
FUCKING SWEET I GOTTA SAY THAT BLOOD EAGLE IS MY FAVORITE BY THEM THE TONE AND ATMOSPHERE ARE SLIGHTLY MORE TO MY LIKING AND THE ALBUM ART IS KILLER
THIS BAND HAS THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO MAKE ME FEEL STONED EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY ACTUAL INTAKE I'M NOT EVEN EXAGGERATING THESE RIFFS MAKE ME ALL HAZY IN THE HEAD
LOVE THESE GUYS I SAW THEM PLAY IN A TINY ROOM AND IT WAS OVERWHELMING
THIS BAND RESONATES WITH ME LIKE NO OTHER
MAKE AMORPHI DEATH DOOM AGAIN
DEFINITELY HAS THEIR SIGNATURE SOUND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT
NOTE THIS IS NOT THE FINAL MIX APPARENTLY THIS IS THE FACEBOOK VERSION
GREAT LIVE BAND VOCALIST IS A MONSTER PRETTY SURE IT WAS DURING THEIR SET THAT U GREATTHUNDEROWL BODY SLAMMED A CROWD KILLER TOO WHICH IS A MEMORY THAT REGARDLESS OF THE SET I WILL ALWAYS HOLD DEAR
FINALLY GOT TO SEE THESE GUYS AFTER HAVING BEEN A FAN FOR YEARS AND THEY DEFINITELY LIVED UP TO THE HYPE IN MY HEAD
LOVE THIS BAND ALTHOUGH NEVER CROSS THE DEAD IS STILL MY FAVORITE BY THEM
THIS IS PRETTY FANTASTIC FIRST TIME I'VE LISTENED TO THEM
FULFILL THE CURSE IS DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE ALBUM BUT DARKNESS DRIPS FORTH IS SUCH A BAD ASS NAME HAHA HOODED MENACE FUCKING RIP
CLASSIC
THOUGHT MAYBE SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THIS HERE I SAW THESE GUYS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL PRETTY SURE THEY NEVER TOURED OR REALLY PLAYED OUTSIDE OF OKLAHOMA
ALSO FFA NOOTHGRUSH ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SLUDGE BANDS FOR SURE
THESE GUYS LOOK LIKE A FUCKING BLAST LIVE
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY ABOUT THIS BAND THAT I ENJOY A SORT OF GROOVY CATCHINESS THAT GOT STOMPED OUT WITH THE BACKLASH AGAINST I HEAR IT IN BABYMETAL TOO
PAGING U
NOT TECH DEATH BUT GOOD STUFF FOR SURE
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE DID NOTHING BUT DOOM DECEMBER OR MAYBE SOME KIND OF PLAY ON SEASON AFFECTIVE DISORDER
NOT TRYING TO DEFEND BOLDER HERE I COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THEM EITHER WAY BUT WHY EAT UP A PRIME TOP BILLING IN A NEXT WEEK RELEASES POST FOR A SONG ALBUM BAND YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO TRASH

EVEN IF THEY MEAN ANTICIPATED BY OTHER PEOPLE FUCK IT LEAVE THEM OFFICIAL GIVE THAT SPACE TO ANY ONE OF OTHER RELEASES COMING OUT THAT WILL BE MORE WORTH IT
THE UPCOMING RELEASES THREADS ON HERE ARE WAY BETTER
BESTIAL BLACK METAL IS STALE THEN GOES ON TO ACT LIKE THE NEW BESTIAL RAIDS IS REALLY ANYTHING MORE THAN ANOTHER GREAT SLAB OF WAR METAL NOW I REMEMBER WHY I STOPPED READING THIS SITE
REALLY HOPE THE NEW ROOT IS A GOOD RETURN TO FORM NOT GONNA HIT THE EARLY TRACKS BECAUSE I'D RATHER HEAR THE WHOLE THING THOUGH
FUCKING HELL LITA IS ONE BAD LADY
SUCH A WEAK AND OVERRATED RECORD I'LL TAKE THE RUNAWAYS OVER ANY OF HER SOLO WORK
THAT GUITAR SOLO THIS SONG GOT ME INTO DT AND MORE INTO PROG METAL IN GENERAL
THIS SONG GETS SO GOOD AT
AHHHH SOME GOOD OL DT I CAN NEVER DECIDE BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY IN MY TOP FEW DT ALBUMS ALONG WITH AWAKE IMAGES AND WORD AND SIX DEGREES

ALTHOUGH I LIKE THE ASTONISHING IT WAS PRETTY LAUGHABLE WHEN I SAW DT FANS ASKING WHICH IS THE BETTER ROCK OPERA SCENES OR THE ASTONISHING THERE IS TRULY NO COMPETITION
ANYBODY INTERESTED IN THE INDIAN SCENE THIS IS A GOOD STARTING POINT THIS AND MILLENNIUM
LOVE IT
THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY KILLER WASN'T TOO IMPRESSED WITH OTHER WORLDS THOUGH
LOVE THIS TUNE
I ALWAYS DID LIKE THIS NAME BETTER
THAT IS THE FUNNIEST NAME FOR A BAND I HAVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME PRETTY SOLID THOUGH NICE FIND
EXCELLENT ALBUM HOPE TO OWN IT AT SOME POINT
LITERALLY HEADING OUT RIGHT NOW TO GO SEE NAPALM DEATH AND TBD GONNA BE A KILLER SHOW
SUPER WEIRD THIS IS THE ONE GRIND BAND I DON'T OWN ANYTHING FROM BUT FUCK MAN I HATE THOSE EARACHE PRICES HALACHA
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THEM THE LAST YEARS THEY'RE COMING TO VANCOUVER FOR YEARS STRAIGHT AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST BANDS TO WATCH LIVE
I WANTED TO COVER THIS SONG A FEW YEARS BACK BUT IT NEVER HAPPENED ABSOLUTELY A KILLER TUNE FROM MY FAVOURITE ND RELEASE
SAXON IS EASILY ONE OF THE FIVE MOST IMPORTANT BANDS IN THE FORMATION OF MY TASTE IN MUSIC

WHEELS OF STEEL STRONG ARM OF THE LAW AND DENIM AND LEATHER ARE ALL LEGENDARY ALBUMS AND WILL ALWAYS BE DEAR TO ME
SAW THEM IN MANCHESTER UK A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THEY'RE AWESOME LIVE
I STILL THINK PRINCESS OF THE NIGHT HAS ONE OF THE BEST RIFFS IN METAL
SAXON IS EASILY ONE OF THE BEST BANDS IN THE WORLDS ALWAYS DELIVERING AND STILL MAKING GREAT MUSIC
WOW LOL NET UNVOTE FOR AN ALBUM THAT SELLS FOR OVER

THERE'S A LIVE VERSION OF THIS THAT I LIKE WHERE THEY'RE ON A FLAT TRAILER PLAYING IN FRONT OF ABOUT PEOPLE I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY BECAUSE I KNOW THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE WALKING BY WONDERING WHAT THE FUCK ALL THAT NOISE IS
THAT OPENING STILL GIVES ME CHILLS AN AMAZING ALBUM
DID THESE GUYS OFFICIALLY CALL IT A DAY OR ARE THEY JUST ON HIATUS LOVED COLUMNS IN DECIBEL TO
I MISS THESE GUYS SO MUCH BOTH OF THEIR ALBUMS ARE INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCES AND I'VE STILL NEVER FOUND ANYTHING ELSE QUITE LIKE THEM
I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THIS SONG THANK YOU

WHAT IS THIS ONLY THING I FOUND OUT IS THAT METAL ARCHIVES DOESN'T CONSIDER THEM METAL CAN SOMEONE TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THEM
LOVE THIS ALBUM
SUCH A WONDERFUL ALBUM WE NEED MORE OF THESE GUYS

OH MANUAL THANKS FOR POSTING THIS BEEN YEARS SINCE I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM GOING TO GIVE IT A SPIN WITH MY NEW HEADPHONES
SCENE KID BULLSHIT FOR BIRD HAIRED WIMPS
TO ME THIS IS THE BEST COMEBACK ALBUM EVER
I HAVEN'T LISTENED TO BLOOD OF NATIONS MUCH BUT STALINGRAD IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING I'M IN LOVE WITH HUNG DRAWN AND QUARTERED
GREAT SONG WOLF SOLOING ON TOP OF A TANK ME HEAD-HANGING A LOT
EVERY TIME I LISTEN TO ACCEPT I'M ALWAYS REMINDED ME OF THE HILARIOUS TWITTER EXPLOITATION THAT HAPPENED WHERE SOME GUY TWEETED ACCEPT AWNS AND FOUND OUT HOW TO FORCE PEOPLE TO FOLLOW YOU WITHOUT APPROVAL LINK
UDO ACCEPT ACCEPT
HOLY SHIT IS THIS EVER CHEESY
AND THEY ARE TOURING TOGETHER WITH SABATON
I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED R METAL HETP
SO FUCKING GOOD THEIR LAST ALBUMS HAVE ALL KICKED SO MUCH ASS
ANOTHER KILLER BRITISH BAND THAT WAS SINGING THAT WAS THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST IN
MAN I REALLY FUCKING MISS THESE GUYS THIS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST FOUR ALBUMS I BOUGHT ON VINYL AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM ANY OF THE MEMBERS SINCE THEY BROKE UP ARE THEY NOT PLAYING IN OTHER BANDS NOW
OKAY THIS IS GREAT WHERE DO I BEGIN MY MORTEM JOURNEY
I ACTUALLY KINDA DUG THAT THAT WAS SOME WILD CAMMY BAR ABUSE
POWER I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THEM AS MORE PROG
THE SONG THAT GOT ME INTO THIS BAND I'M SO GLAD I GOT INTO THEM ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS ALBUM AND ESPECIALLY AWAKEN THE GUARDIAN
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC BAND FANS SHOULD BE SURE TO CHECK OUT ADRAMELECH IT AND GEHENNA MEX BOTH OF THEM TOOK HEAVY QUEUES FROM FATES WARNING WHEN THEY WERE FINDING THEIR OWN SOUNDS
I HAVE LISTENED TO NIGHT ON BROCKEN SPECTRE WITHIN AND AWAKEN THE GUARDIAN COUNTLESS TIMES OVER THE LAST YEARS I WILL NEVER TIRE OF JOHN ARCH FRONTED FATES
WAS SO PSYCHED TO SEE THEM AT PROGPOWER LAST YEAR FANTASTIC BAND FANTASTIC ALBUM
WHAT'S YOUR BUDGET
THE R VINYL SIDEBAR LOOKS PRETTY HELPFUL
YOU CAN GET FULLY SETUP WITH A TURN ORBIT IT'S A FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE TABLE WHICH ALLOWS FOR UPGRADES OVER TIME

U TURN BASIC PLUTO PREAMP

IF YOU HAVE ACTIVE SPEAKERS YOU CAN PLUG THEM INTO WALL THEN YOU'RE GOOD TO GO


I PREFER DJ STYLE TURNTABLES TO AUDIOPHILE TURNTABLES TECHNICS SL REMAINS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR THAT SORT OF THING
I HAVE HEARD THAT YOU HAVE TO GET A RECORD PLAYER MADE OUT OF SOLID STEEL AND GRANITE THE EXPENSIVE ONES ARE MADE OUT OF TUNGSTEN AND DIAMOND WHICH IS HEAVIER

INTERESTING FACT SPEED METAL TURNTABLES INTERESTINGLY PLAY EVERYTHING AT RPM REGARDLESS OF THE DIAMETER


BRATS GOOD
NOT BAD
WOW THIS IS REALLY COOL ESPECIALLY THE ENDING
A REALLY COOL ALBUM I JUMPED ON A BIT LATE SADLY THEIR DEMO IS KILLER TOO

IF I HAVE A GRIPE IT'S THAT I DON'T THINK THE NAME IS VERY GOOD I ALWAYS THINK OF CAPTAIN CAVEMAN I GUESS HE COULD DO SOME MEAN DRUMMING WITH HIS CLUB
I SAW THESE GUYS REFORMED THIS YEAR ARE THEY MAKING ANY NEW ALBUMS OR JUST DOING SOME LIVE SHOWS
IVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS EP
I HAD NEVER BOTHERED TO LISTEN TO THESE GUYS BEFORE DESPITE HEARING THE NAME A MILLION TIMES PRETTY DECENT I LIKE THE GUITAR PLAYER COMBINE THIS GUITAR PLAYER'S CAMMY ABUSE WITH VAN HALEN LICKS AND YOU GET TREY AZAGTHOTH
THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION U OPINER AND U
GOD I LOVE THIS SPECIFIC SONG OF THE ENTIRE ALBUM
BY RANDOM COINCIDENCE I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM TODAY AT WORK I MADE MY PLAYLIST A FEW DAYS IN ADVANCE SO IT WASN'T SPURRED ON BY THE RECENT CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ALBUM MR DEATH IS MY FAVOURITE TRACK BUT THIS ONE OBVIOUSLY RULES TOO

THIS ALBUM WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST CD FOR ME TO FIND I THINK I WAS LOOKING FOR IT FOR ABOUT YEARS BEFORE FINALLY FINDING IT
GREAT ALBUM I HAVE YET TO CHECK OUT ANYTHING ELSE THEY'VE PUT OUT BEEN LAGGING IT FOR YEARS
I ALWAYS WONDER WHY THESE GUYS WEREN'T AREN'T MORE POPULAR GREAT RIFFS GREAT SOLOS TOLERABLE SINGING GOOD DRUMMING CATCHY HOOKS PUNKY ENERGY WHATS NOT TO LOVE
FANS OF THIS RECORD AND BAND SHOULD CHECK OUT THE NEW DEATH FORTRESS ALBUM FROM THIS YEAR GREAT HATE FOREST WORSHIP
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MORATORIUM ON NSB

EDIT I WAS REFERRING TO WHEN THE SAME GUY POSTED LIKE NSB SONGS IN ONE AYM
GOT THIS THE OTHER DAY SO GOOD
GREAT BAND
GREAT BAND AND ALBUM
REALM OF SACRIFICE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE RELEASES LAST YEAR EVERYTHING FROM THAT GROUP OF GUYS IS AMAZING
DAMN I REALLY LIKE THE VOCAL EFFECT AFTER

DEFINITELY DIG THE MINIMALIST APPEARANCE THEY HAVE GOING HERE A LOT OF BANDS COULD LEARN FROM THIS
I WONDER WHAT POLISH TONGUE TWISTERS ARE LIKE
THIS ALBUM AND THE DEBUT ARE BOTH FANTASTIC HOVERCRAFT JUST MAKES EVERYTHING EVEN BETTER
HUGEST SOUND I'VE HEARD FROM A DEATH METAL BAND FOR A WHILE THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS FANTASTIC

PLUS HOVERCRAFT
SUCH A PHENOMENAL ALBUM ONE OF MY FAVORITES FROM LAST YEAR
SKID ROW RULES
FUN FACT THIS WAS THE FIRST METAL ALBUM TO DEBUT AT ON BILLBOARD
I'VE ALWAYS CONSIDERED THIS ALBUM MORE TYPE GROOVE METAL NEVER THOUGHT OF IT AS HAIR METAL
THIS AND MONKEY BUSINESS ARE BOTH CLASSICS


BLOODY HELL I THOUGHT THIS SONG WAS FROM OR SOMETHING
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE RECORD SEBASTIAN BACH'S VOCALS ABSOLUTELY KILL
THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW ALBUMS THAT TO THIS DAY I CAN LISTEN TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NEVER GET SICK OF
MY BEST FRIEND AT THE TIME AND I ALWAYS SANG YOU CAN'T BE KING OF THE WORLD WITH THAT BIG FAT BEHIND
I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME HEARING SKID ROW THAT SONG WAS CATCHY AS FUCK WHAT ARE SOME OTHER FAVORITES YOU GUYS LIKE A LOT
SKID ROW PANTER AT THE MEADOWLANDS SUMMERIEST IN JERSEY SUMMER I'VE BEEN TO HUNDREDS OF CONCERTS AND THAT ONE WAS THE FUCKING SHIT HANDS DOWN BEST SHOW OF MY LIFE BOTH BANDS KILLED IT
HAVING ONLY HEARD AND LIFE THIS SONG WAS SURE A SURPRISE
SO IN I WAS HANGING OUT WITH SOME PEOPLE AT A PARTY I ROLLED IN WITH THIS TAPE I PUT IT ON THEY THOUGHT I HAD BROUGHT IN SOME BADASS NEW METAL BAND WHEN I TOLD THEM WHO IT WAS THEY MADE ME TAKE THE TAPE OUT LATER THAT NIGHT I GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH SOME DUDE I NEVER HUNG OUT WITH THAT BUNCH AGAIN ACTUALLY I THINK THAT NIGHT CHANGED MY LIFE
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SONGS FROM THEM AND AS WELL THE TUNE THAT MAKES A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAIR ROCK METAL AND HEAVY METAL I HAVE TO AGREE WITH AEKHAMPATIENT I WOULD NEVER CONSIDER THEM HAIR METAL
I INTERVIEW SE YEARS AGO AND DESPITE A FEW ABSURDITIES HE IS A GREAT FRONT MANUAL
I WILL ALWAYS UNVOTE THIS SONG
IVE ONLY EVER HEARD THE CHORUS TO THIS SONG PRETTY BADASS SONG
AT A SKID ROW SHOW YOU'D BE HEARING PEOPLE CONSTANTLY SHOUT TO LIFE IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T APPRECIATE THIS SONG AT ALL IT'S A SHAME
DELETED
LOUD AND FAST JUST LIKE DADDY LIKES IT

THE WHOLE ALBUM IS AVAILABLE IN BETTER QUALITY AT BANDCAMP
GREAT BAND IFFY NAME
OK SO THIS WASNT DISAPPOINTING AT ALL BUT IT PUT ME OFF ABIT IN APRIL MEGADEATH ANTHRAX AND OVERKILL CAME TO PLAY THRASH THE ISLAND FESTIVAL WHERE I LIVE IN PUERTO RICO NOW KEEP IN MIND METAL BANDS NEVER COME TO PUERTO RICO AND SEEING 2 OUT OF THE BIG IN ONE NIGHT WAS AMAZING SO OVERKILL AND ANTHRAX PLAY THEIR SET AND EVERYTHING IS AMAZING MEGADEATH THEN CAME ON STARTING WITH HANGAR NOW THE SHOW IS GOING PERFECT WITHOUT A HITCH UNTIL SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED DAVE GOT ON THE MIC AND ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WERE GONNA PLAY PEACE SELLS BUT HERES THE THING THEY ALREADY PLAYED IT SONGS AGO SO THE CONCERT GOES SILENT AND THE DRUMMER TELLS HIM SOMETHING AND HE STARTS HOLY WARS NOW HOLY WARS IS MY FAVORITE SONG OF ALL TIME AND MY DREAM WAS TO SEE IT PLAYED LIVE SO THE SONG STARTS BUT DAVE STARTED SINGING TOO LATE AND CAUSED THE DRUMMER WHO WASNT DIRK OR CHRIS TO GET CONFUSED BUT THEY STILL PLAYED IT OFFICIAL WHEN THE PUNISHMENT DUE RIFF STARTS DAVE STOPS TO SCRATCH HIS EAR WITCH CAUSED HIM TO SKIP A NOTE THAT PRETTY MUCH RUINED THE MOMENT SO DAVE KINDA FUCKED UP HOLY WARS BUT HE PLAYED THE SOLO PERFECTLY DONT GET ME WRONG ALL THREE BANDS WERE AMAZING THAT NIGHT BUT SEEING THE SONG IVE ALLAYS WANTED TO HEAR LIVE GETTING FUCKED UP KINDA REASSURED THE OL NEVER MEET YOUR HEROES MINDSET STILL AWESOME SHOW
ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT THEY ONLY PLAYED A HANDFUL OF TRACKS OFF AMERICAN PARANOIA AND WHEN THEY DID THEY PLAYED THE MEATHEAD VERSIONS THEY RECORDED ON NO WAY BACK BASICALLY THEY BECAME A TOUGH GUY HARDCORE BAND WHEN THEY REFORMED I SHOULD HAVE FIGURED WHEN PEOPLE WERE MORE EXCITED FOR FREAKING SPAZZTIC BLUER THAN THEY WERE FOR AA THE CROWD WENT FROM FAIRLY PACKED TO ONLY A HANDFUL OF GUYS AT THE FRONT OF THE STAGE
WHEN I SAW INCANTATION MCENTEE WAS OUT BELIEVE HIS WIFE HAD A MEDICAL ISSUE AND THE REPLACEMENT VOCALIST WASN'T VERY GOOD ON TOP OF THAT THE SOUND IN THAT LITTLE TINY ROOM THEY PLAYED IN SUCKED SO IT WAS AN ALL-AROUND BUMMER SEEING THEM AGAIN NEXT MONTH WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE UP FOR IT
BUTCHER BABIES WAS THE WORST THING I'VE EVER SEEN ON A STAGE
OZZFEST WAS TERRIBLE THIS YEAR AT LEAST IN THE SENSE THAT I WAS DEHYDRATED TIRED HAD A HORRIBLE MIGRAINE AND BEAT UP MISSED SABBATH BECAUSE I LEFT DURING MEGADEATH BUT I JUST COULD NOT HANG ANY MORE THAT DUST HEAT AND LACK OF WATER FUCKING KILLED ME

I SAW FAC OPEN FOR GAR ONCE THAT WAS PRETTY TERRIBLE

WORST EVER IS PROBABLY THE AUGE THOUGH TED SPENDS HALF THE SHOW SHIT TALKING OBAMA I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR HIM EITHER BUT FUCK MAN ATTACKING HIM ON CONSPIRACY THEORY BULLSHIT HE'S A MUSLIM HE WASN'T EVEN BORN IN THIS COUNTRY HE'S A COMMUNIST HE HATES AMERICANS FUCK GAY MARRIAGE FUCK ABORTION ETC ETC ETC IS JUST FUCKING TIRING JUST PLAY STRANGLE HOLD AND SHUT THE FUCK UP TED
SAW ALL THAT REMAINS AND SLAYER AT A METAL FEST IN TAMPA A FEW YEARS AGO AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH BOTH OF THEM ALL THAT REMAINS VOCALIST WAS TERRIBLE HE KEPT HOLDING THE MIC TO THE CROWD BECAUSE HE COULDN'T DO THE VOCALS AND THE TIMING WAS WAY OFF FUCKING HORRIBLE SLAYER SOUNDED LIKE TOTAL SHIT GUITARS OUT OF TUNE AND CUTTING OUT AND THE DRUMMER SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS GOING HALF SPEED THANKFULLY THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER GOD FORBID AND JOB FOR A COWBOY MADE IT MORE THAN WORTH THE MONEY STILL A DISAPPOINTMENT
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S METAL ENOUGH FOR THIS SUB BUT I WENT TO SEE KILLING JOKE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND IT WAS PRETTY HIT OR MISS

I'M A FAN OF THEIR EARLIER STUFF AND THEIR MORE RECENT HEAVIER STUFF THE EARLY STUFF SOUNDED FANTASTIC AND WERE DEFINITELY THE HIGH POINTS OF THE GIG BUT THE LATER HEAVIER STUFF DIDN'T REALLY TRANSLATE LIVE THEY JUST COULDN'T CAPTURE THE AGGRESSION OR HEAVINESS OF THE ALBUMS
WHENEVER I SEE STAM THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE THE AGGRESSION THEIR MUSIC DESERVES AND THE SINGER IS USUALLY OFF KEY LOST HIS VOICE OR JUST SOUNDS A LOT WORSE MPH

EDIT I ALSO SAW SOME HARDCORE METALCORE DDK GIG AND IT WAS SO GOOD THAT I JUST GOT DRUNK AND TRIED NOT TO FALL ASLEEP I STARED AT THE LIGHTS AND BOPPED MY HEAD WITH MY EYES GOING OPEN AND SHUT CAN'T SAY I REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THE MUSIC BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD TO ALMOST LULL ME INTO SLEEP IN A BAR
IN FLAMES IN MANCHESTER UK ON THE A SENSE OF PURPOSE TOUR AND THEY ONLY PLAYED SONG EPISODE I THINK WHICH WAS GREAT

I GUESS THEY PUT ON A GOOD PERFORMANCE BUT BY DECIDING TO FOCUS PREDOMINANTLY ON THE LATEST ALBUM NOT EVEN MUCH FROM COME CLARITY WHICH WAS ONLY THE ALBUM BEFORE THEY CLEARLY DISAPPOINTED A LOT OF THE FANS THERE

BLDR IN FLAMES BEING IN FLAMES
I HAVEN'T HAD A SHITTY DISAPPOINTING CONCERT YET I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT GUNS N ROSES NEXT YEAR THOUGH BUT I'VE SEEN SOME PRETTY BAD OPENING ACTS SHILHA OPENING FOR AC DC SUCKED ASS BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST BECAUSE I HATE SHILHA LAMB OF GOD HAD SOME LOCAL BAND ON BEFORE THEM WHOSE NAME I HAVE FORGOTTEN AND THE SOUND MIXING WAS BAD THE GUITARIST WAS SHIT AND THE SINGER KEPT TELLING US TO OPEN UP A CIRCLE PIT WHEN THE CROWD WAS BARELY EVEN COSHING
GOAJIRO PLEASE DON'T TRY TO COME UP ON STAGE IF YOU KICK THE MIC ITS HURTS MY TEETH AND WE ALL GO HOME

FRENCH PEOPLE
ISIS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE BANDS OF ALL TIME AND THEIR SHOW IN SYDNEY BORED ME SO MUCH I DIDN'T LISTEN TO THEM AGAIN FOR YEARS
JUST SAW THEM IN MILWAUKEE THIS WEEK PRETTY GOOD FOR A FREE SHOW
MY FAVOURITE SONG OF THE NEW ALBUM SO BLOODY GOOD
NO UPVOTES FOR THIS WHAT A TRAVESTY
PHENOMENAL ALBUM REALLY WANT ONE OF THE EARLY IE ORIGINAL MASTER PRESSINGS


I THINK ULTIMATE INCANTATION IS A BIT OVERRATED BUT SOTHIS AND DE PROFOUNDS IS CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED

ONE OF MY FAVE VADER SONGS GOOD CHOICE
THAT BEEFY BASS DRUM IS JUST LOVELY
IT'S REALLY A SHAME THAT THEY NEVER TOPPED THEIR UTTERLY FANTASTIC DEMOS THEIR ALBUMS ARE ALL SOLID BUT IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME
INTERESTING HOW HIS VIBRATO INTENSIFIES BUT HIS VOICE IS A LOT LOWER LIVE THAN ON RECORD KIND OF WISH HE WOULD PERHAPS GO JUST A BIT LOWER AND ADD A LITTLE MORE ENERGY SO IT WOULD HAVE HAD MORE BALLS
WONDER WHEN WE'LL BE GETTING A NEW UNIONIC ALBUM
FUCK I HOPE MY BAND CAN FINISH WRITING ENOUGH SHIT TO GIG SOON COME APRIL WE'RE DEAD ANYWAY CAUSE OUR MAIN SONGWRITER AND MY BEST FRIEND IS MOVING CROSS-COUNTRY

I SAY THAT BECAUSE WE'RE COVERING THIS TRACK IF I CAN FINISH THE LYRICS AND HE CAN FINISH THE LEADS FOR OUR OTHER ORIGINAL SONGS
REALLY HOPE I HAVE CAN AFFORD ONE OF THE REISSUES OF THIS OR THE EP BEFORE THEY SELL OUT
ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATEST RECORDS ATLANTEAN CODEX HAVE ALSO DONE A GREAT COVER OF THIS SONG
LOVE THE VAGUELY DICK SHAPED CLOUD ON THE LEFT GREAT BAND
THIS IS THE CATCHIEST GODDAMN SONG
HEY COOL I DIDN'T KNOW A BAND WROTE A SONG ABOUT MY PENIS
THAT SONG TITLE ALMOST MAKES THEN SEEN SELF AWARE
I REALLY ENJOYED THIS SONG LAMB OF GOD IS ONE OF THE ENTRY LEVEL BANDS THAT I STILL REALLY ENJOY
NOT MY STYLE OF VOCALS BIT THE SOUND PRODUCTION WAS NICE AND TIGHT AND THE ENERGY WAS GREAT BONUS POINTS FOR BEING ABLE TO HEAR THE BASS IN THE MIX AS WELL
TOTALLY JUST REDISCOVERED THESE GUYS FORGOT ALL ABOUT THEM THEY OPENED FOR FDP BACK IN THE DAY GREAT BAND
LAO LOOK GUYS I CAN HELICOPTER MY HAIR TOO
I'VE NEVER MET A METALHEAD WHO DIDN'T LIKE THIS SONG WHEN I SHOWED IT TO THEM GREAT BAND GREAT SONG
MOTOR CITY THRASH GREAT BAND EVEN GREATER DUDES
WOW GREAT SONG I'M PSYCHED TO CHECK OUT THEIR ALBUM S THANKS OP
THESE GUYS ARE INCREDIBLY BADASS MUSICIANS AND SUPER NICE GUYS LUCKILY THEY COME TO A SMALL VENUE NEAR ME EVERY YEAR ON THEIR WINTER WARRIORS TOUR WAR OF WILL IS EASILY ONE OF MY FAVORITE MODERN METAL RECORDS
GREAT LIVE SEEN THEM WITH SUFFOCATION AND SOULFUL I WAS MORE EXCITED ABOUT BATTLECROSS MORE THAN ANYTHING SICK AS FUCK

CUTTING OUT THE INTRO IS SACRILEGE THE DRUM WORK IN IT IS AWESOME
CLASSIC STUFF SODOM ARE AMAZING
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE EBBMAN WITHOUT BESTIAL MOCKERY



WARLUCK FUCKED WITH A HELLBORN
ONLY CHAINSAW METAL IST REAL
THESE GUYS NEVER GET ENOUGH RESPECT
PICKED UP SOME BESTIAL MOCKERY ON A WHIM EARLIER THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT WAS SUPER CHEAP IN A DDR SALE AND I UNWITTINGLY HAD THE FALSE BURNED AND DIED RIGHT OUT OF ME
DON'T CALL ME YOUR BROTHER

I AIN'T YOUR FUCKING BROTHER

WE FELL FROM DIFFERENT CUNTS

AND YOUR SKIN'S AN UGLY COLOR
I FEEL LIKE THIS GUY IN THE YOUTUBE COMMENTS MANAGED TO BREAK DOWN THE MESSAGE OF THE SONG PERFECTLY

I THINK THIS SONG IS LITERALLY HALF JOKE HALF SERIOUS THE FIRST HALF BEING JOKE DESCRIBING GENERIC GROTESQUE RACE WAR SITUATION WHILE AT THE SAME SAME TIME DISMISSING VIOLENCE AS A SOLUTION NO ONE WINS WE ALL LOSE

THE SECOND PART OF THE SONG IS WHERE IT GETS SLIGHTLY MORE SERIOUS IT DOESN'T SEEM SO INTENTIONALLY OR ABSURD AS LYRICS OFTEN ARE THIS IS WHERE HE RECOGNIZES THAT THERE SIMPLE ARE CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS IN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING CAIN AND ABLE SET THE COURSE THAT WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO GET OVER WITH AND WE SHOULD JUST RATHER FACE THE FACT AND FIND OTHER SOLUTIONS INSTEAD OF FORCED MULTICULTURALISM

XENOPHOBIC TENDENCIES
INSTILLED IN US AT BIRTH
ARE DISABLED RACISM
HOSTILITIES GETTING WORSE
ACCEPT THE FACT MY DISTANT COUSIN
WE CANNOT LIVE IN PEACE
ISOLATED ENVIRONMENTS
MAY JUST BE THE KEY

SO THE LESSON OF THE SONG IS THAT RACE HATE WILL TAKE US NOWHERE BUT NEITHER WILL IMAGINARY LA-LA LANDS WHERE RACIAL DIFFERENCES DON'T EXIST I KINDA LIKE HOW CARNIVORE IS ABLE TO FIND TO MAKE KINDA SMART ANALYSIS THROUGH SUCH VERY PROVOKING SONG
SHOW LESS
A MASCULINE A I MET PETER STEELE
GREAT RECORD CHEERS PETER
ALL I CAN THINK OF WHEN I HEAR THIS

HEY BILL RACE WAR
IT'S SO CUTE WHEN PEOPLE DISCOVER THIS BAND FOR THE FIRST TIME
I GOT TO A FAIRLY SMALL UNIVERSITY AND IN MY WORLD RELIGIONS COURSE WE WERE DISCUSSING BUDDHISM AND HE TOLD US ABOUT SOME TIBETAN BUDDHISTS COMING TO CAMPUS FOR A BIT AND I MENTIONED HOW THIS ALBUM HAD STRONG TIES TO BUDDHISM AND WAS CENTRALIZED ON TIBET AND HE WAS INTERESTED AND SAID HE'D CHECK IT OUT HE CAME UP TO ME AFTER THE NEXT CLASS AND TOLD ME THE SOUNDS I HEARD WEREN'T REALLY SOUNDS I LIKE TO HEAR HAHA HE'S A SOLID DUDE AND THE FACIAL EXPRESSION HE HAD WHEN HE SAID THAT JUST REALLY GOT ME I WARNED HIM BEFOREHAND THOUGH BUT STILL PRETTY COOL THAT A YR OLD PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR WOULD CHECK OUT A DEATH METAL ALBUM SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE THEME MAD RESPECT TO HIM
AMAZING BAND AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
GOING THROUGH RARE AND OBSCURE METAL ARCHIVES
WOW THAT CREATOR VIDEO REALLY DIDN'T LEAVE MUCH OUT BOOBS VIOLENCE BLOOD AND SATAN
THAT ALTHA ALBUM IS SO GREAT
THESE POSTS ARE TERRIFIC MATE I LOOK FORWARD TO THEM EVERY WEEK

EDIT THAT NEW REASSAIL WAS GODDAMN PERFECT ON A GLOOMY DAY TO BE FILLED WITH RAKING
HOLY SHIT THAT CREATOR TRACK JUST FLAT CRUSHES IT COMPLETELY ON BOARD WITH WANTING TO HEAR MORE
DO YOU WRITE FOR A WEBSITE BY CHANCE THESE POSTS ARE AWESOME
THANKS FOR PUTTING SO MUCH EFFORT INTO THIS THREAD
NEW SUPERJOINED MAKES ME HAPPY
REASSAIL WAS A NICE SURPRISE NEVER HEARD OF THIS DUDES BEFORE BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD SO FAR IT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD
AESOP DEKKER ON DRUMS

CURIOUS BUT WHY DID YOU PICK VTOL INSTEAD OF AGALLOCH AS A DESCRIPTOR
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD ENJOY THE NEW ANTAEUS ALBUM MORE THAN I ACTUALLY DO ON A CURSORY LISTEN VERY LITTLE STOOD OUT TO ME I OFTEN HAD TROUBLE TELLING ONE SONG APART FROM THE OTHER PERHAPS I NEED TO LISTEN MORE ATTENTIVELY BUT ON MY FIRST LISTEN I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING THAT MADE ME WANT TO LISTEN TO IT AGAIN

THAT NEW CREATOR SONG IS PRETTY FUCKING SICK THOUGH SUPER CONSISTENT BAND PUTS METALLICA TO SHAME FRANKLY
FUCK YES MORE SHIT FROM IRON REAGAN

ALTHA IS NOT COMPLETELY SINCE AT LEAST THEY RIPPED OFF THE SONG LENGTHS AND THE INTRO IS JUST LIKE ON A METALLICA ALBUM TOO LONG AND STUPID OTHER THAN THAT THE SIMILARITIES PRETTY MUCH END THERE IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD INTERESTING AND CHALLENGING MUSIC

ALWAYS READ THIS POSTS THANKS FOR ALL MEN GREAT REDACTION COMPARISON AND NEW BANDS TO LISTEN

REASSAIL ALBUM ARE GREAT IF THE BAND DO A LIMITED PRESS OF IT IN VINYL I'M GOING TO BUY IT FOR SURE
LISTEN TO THE NEW BEHOLD THE ARCTOPUS RECORD FULL OF UNCALLED FOR COLIN

YOU GOT SOME WRITING CHOPS I'M AMAZED AT HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO SAY SO MUCH IN LITERALLY HALF A SENTENCE THERE
AWESOME POST I WILL DEFINITELY BE CHECKING BACK WEEKLY THANKS
NEW QUICKSAND DREAM IS AMAZING AND YOU MISSED THAT EVERYONE INTO TRAD SHOULD CHECK IT
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BAND THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVOURITE BLACK METAL EPS
GOOD QUESTION THIS BAND AND TRACK IS AWESOME
WHY THE DOWNVOTES APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE I'M A NEWBIE AT THIS
JUST SAW THEM LAST NIGHT BEEN GREAT IF THE SOUND GUY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING COULD BARLEY HEAR ANY LEAD GUITAR
I STILL LOL HOW AWESOME THE ALBUM COVER IS

I'VE HEARD THIS BAND BEING TALKED ABOUT A FEW TIMES ON HERE AND THIS WAS MY FIRST LISTEN

I'M A BIT CONFLICTED I LIKE THE GUITAR WORK AND OVERALL FEEL BUT THE DRUMMING IS JUST A PUT OFF FOR ME IT HAS THAT REALLY CLICKY MODERN BLACK METAL DRUM TONE I'M NOT A FAN OF

IT WAS NICE THOUGH JUST WISH THE DRUMS HAD A BIT MORE OOMPH TO THEM
IF YOU CAN GET PAST THE CHRISTIAN LYRICS THIS IS A REALLY FANTASTIC ALBUM IN MY OPINION GREAT RIFFS AND THE WAY THEY USE SYNTHS AND ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS IS QUITE SUBTLE AND TASTEFUL WORKS REALLY WELL
FUCKING AMAZING BAND ONE OF THE BEST RIGHT NOW I WANT ANOTHER LP
DEFINEDLY NEED TO CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT AND THEIR OTHERS TOO
HELL YEAH I CROWDFUNDED THIS AWESOME EPISTLE
I FEEL THE VOCALS ARE MORE REFINED ON THEIR NEWER RELEASES BUT THE SOUND OF THE INSTRUMENTS THE POWER OF RIFFS ARE THERE IT STILL KICKS ASS AND I HAVE TO SAY INSTRUMENTALLY IT'S IMPRESSIVE
AS BRILLIANT AS THEY ARE MUSICALLY IT'S A SHAME THEY WENT WITH THIS STUPID MODERN COVER ART TREND WITH THEIR SEASON OF MIST RELEASES REISSUES


CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC AGALLOCH WAS GREAT BECAUSE THE MEMBERS OF THAT BAND BALANCED OUT EACH OTHERS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

AMAZING BAND BUT WOULDN'T REALLY CALL THEIR EARLY STUFF ESPECIALLY EXTREME METAL IT'S JUST WEIRD HARDCORE
M
I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS BAND

PROOF THAT SOMETIMES A BAND CAN COLLAPSE INTO ITS OWN SELF-AGGRANDIZING POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT OF ALL BANDS FROM THE NORSE SCENE

UNCENSORED
MAN I FUCKING LOVE CREATOR
THE CHORUS IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO UNITED IN HATE

WE SHALL KILL VERSUS WE ARE LEGIONS WITH A VERY SIMILAR MELODY UNDERNEATH

I STILL LIKE THE SONG BUT DID THEY REALLY NOT NOTICE THAT
SOUNDS GREAT ANOTHER GOOD CREATOR SONG WITH A CONTINUATION OF THE PHANTOM ANTICHRIST SOUND IS GOOD WITH ME
I AM NONE OF THOSE THAT SEE PHANTOM ANTICHRIST AS SUCH A PERFECT ALBUM AS MANY SEEM TO DO BUT I LOVE IT GOT TO SAY THIS IS ABOUT ON THE SAME LEVEL MAYBE SLIGHTLY UNDER IT BUT I AM CERTAINLY VERY EXCITED FOR THE ALBUM
HONESTLY I THOUGHT THIS WAS A WEAK EFFORT BY CREATOR
NOEVDIA IS THE OFFICIAL YOUTUBE ACCOUNT FOR THIS RELEASE
THIS NEW ALBUM JUST DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME MAYBE IT'S THE PRODUCTION OR POSSIBLY JUST THE DRUMMING BUT EVERY SONG FEELS THE EXACT SAME WASN'T JUST THE FIRST TIME LISTENERS VIBE EITHER I GAVE IT A FEW SPINS
TOTALLY CLASSIC BAND FANS SHOULD ALSO CHECK OUT TALES OF MEDUSA WHO ARE NAMED AFTER A SONG FROM THIS EPISTLE
ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER RECORDED
MORE PEOPLE SHOULD LISTEN TO THIS KRABATHOR ETC
I HAVE THIS ALBUM ON TAPE BECAUSE U HIGDON IS A NICE GUY AND THREW IT IN FOR FREE WITH AN ORDER I MADE FROM HIM ALSO HAVE ONE OF THEIR S LYING AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE
GREAT FOLK RECORD S AND KILLER DUDES ATE BURRITOS AND STOOD IN DEGREE WEATHER TALKING WITH THEM FOR A FEW HOURS AWESOME DUDES
THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS GREAT ALTHOUGH I PREFER THE SWEDISH VERSIONS AS I AM FROM SWEDEN
ALBUM
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WAS ONE OF THE WEAKER TRACKS INCLUDED ON THE ADDICTION AND PURE MADNESS COMPILATION BUT NOW I'VE GOT OVER THE SYNTH AND PIANO SECTIONS THAT INITIALLY DREW ME IN THIS ONE OF THE BEST TRACKS ON THE EARLIER HALF OF IT EXCELLENT PARTS IN IT JUST LIKE WITH THE LAST PART OF THE NEXT TRACK INCLUDED SHADOW THORNS
YEARS OF DRINKING BROUGHT LIVER PROBLEMS ON SO MANY GUYS FROM THE METAL COMMUNITY
DAMN THAT SUCKS WISH HIM THE BEST
EVERYBODY WAS TALKING SHIT ABOUT HIM FALLING OFF THE WAGON WHEN THEY HAD TO CANCEL THEIR DATES AWHILE BACK I HOPE THEY FEEL STUPID NOW
MIKE HELPED BRING THE GIFT OF SLUDGE TO US PULLING FOR HIM TO GET BETTER
DDK IF I KEPT CRASHING MY CAR INTO SHIT AND BEING A SHIT DRIVER I WOULDN'T EXPECT ANYONE TO DONATE MONEY FOR REPAIRS OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE THAT BEING SAID I LOVE EEG TAKE AS NEEDED FOR PAIN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS AND I HOPE FOR THE BEST FOR MIKE
ABSOLUTELY LOVE EARLY THEATRE OF TRAGEDY ESPECIALLY AEGIS WHICH IS A REAL STAPLE OF GOTHIC METAL IT'S TOO BAD FOR MY TASTE THAT THE BAND WENT IN THE DIRECTION THEY WENT AFTER THEIR FIRST THREE ALBUMS
HE'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PEOPLE IN METAL BIG FAN OF HIM AND HIS MUSIC
WOW I NEVER WOULD THOUGHT PEOPLE WOULD THINK HUMANURE WAS THE MORE OFFENSIVE ART WORK
I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T MENTION HIMSELF BEING ON THE COVER OF TO SERVE MAN WEARING FULL MAKEUP AND PROSTHETICS
I ALWAYS ASSUMED MONOLITH WAS A REFERENCE TO A SPACE ODYSSEY I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T MENTION IT
I LOVE THIS GUY
MAN THAT IS SOME DEEP SHIT
LOVE CREAM-FACED BUT HOLY SHIT ASIDE FROM THEIR LATEST MATERIAL IT'S INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE TO GET THE CDS
DAT FUCKING LINEUP I'LL DEFINITELY CHECK THIS OUT

EDIT THIS IS COOL
ALABAMA REPRESENT LOVE THIS BAND
AS AN ERA RIGHT AROUND OR AS A SONIC PROFILE FOR DEATH METAL NEVER THERE'S STILL STUFF BEING MADE IN THAT VEIN AND THERE WAS THROUGH THE ENTIRE AND
TOP FIVE ALBUMS ON RATE YOUR MUSIC IN DEATH METAL SUBGENRE INCLUSIVE



LEGION
LAST ONE ON EARTH
SLUMBER OF SULLEN EYES
THE ILTH CRUSADE
ONWARD TO GOLGOTHA



NESPITHE
HEARTWORM
COVENANT
FOCUS
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHT PATTERN

SEEMS PRETTY CUT AND DRY TO ME
I'D CONSIDER OLD-SCHOOL DEATH METAL TO BE ANYTHING PRIOR TO THOUGH THE STYLE PEAKED IN BETWEEN
MAYBE OR SO IT'S HARD TO SAY IT'S SORT OF LIKE HOW THRASH TOOK A NOSEDIVE AFTER BUT THERE WERE STILL A FEW STRAGGLERS AFTER THAT MOST OF THE GREAT OCDM WAS OR EARLIER BUT THERE ARE SOME ALBUMS THAT CAME OUT AFTER THAT SEEM APPROPRIATE TO FIT IN WITH OCDM
MAYHEM WITH CHIMERA ALBUM
I LIKED THIS EP A LOT ONE OF THE BEST RELEASES FROM EARLIER IN THE YEAR
THE WHOLE ALBUM CALLED SORG CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PLAYLIST
AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ARTIST A FAIR BIT OVER THE PAST YEAR I'VE GOT TO SAY THIS TRACK ALTHOUGH SURROUNDED BY LOTS OF GREAT TRACKS IT'S TRULY STAND OUT I'M WILLING TO SAY NOW THAT IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITE TRACKS OF ALL TIME

THE MOMENT AT WHEN THE BEAT PICKS UP AGAIN AFTER THE LONG SORROWFUL TRUDGING ALONG OF EVERYTHING THAT COMES BEFORE IS JUST PERFECT IT FEELS POWERFUL JUST BEFORE IT HAPPENS AND SO SATISFYING ONCE IT DOES
AHOUH ONE OF THE BANDS USHERED IN ON IMPRINTS BACK WHEN NSB WAS BEING REBRANCHED UNDER THE CATCHALL OF PAGANISM

MEMORIES

YOU GOT A MINUTE SONG TALKING ABOUT A LIBRARY AND IT WORKS SO WHY NOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KILL PEOPLE TO BE BRUTAL

I FUCKING LOVE LUC
I WAS JUST WAITING FOR LUC TO NAME-DROP DSO DUDE JUST CAN'T HIDE HIS FANBOYISM

HE SEEMS LIKE A SUPER CHILL AND HUMBLE GUY I'D LOVE TO HANG OUT WITH HIM

EDIT THAT BIT AT THE END ABOUT HOW WE DON'T NEED A MILLION BANDS PLAYING LIKE SUFFOCATION IS SO TRUE AND VALID FOR SO MANY OTHER BANDS
LEGEND ONE OF THE THRILLS OF MY LIFE WAS SEEING THIS MAN LIVE
DUDE IS SOUNDS LIKE A FUCKING DEMON IN HIS MUSIC SUPER NICE AND SMART IN PERSON SAW THEM IN OCT GREAT SHOW
LUC RULES CHAINING THE KATECHON IS SO FUCKING GOOD I FEEL LIKE THE NEW DEATHSPELL OMEGA RECORD IS ALSO MORE OR LESS A COHESIVE MINUTE SONG AS WELL DESPITE OFFICIALLY HAVING FOUR TRACKS
I REALLY NEED TO GIVE THEIR ALBUMS AFTER EROSION A PROPER LISTEN CONSIDERED DEAD IS WHAT I CONSIDER GORGETS BUT DAMN IT'S REALLY NOT
LUC REALLY SEEMS LIKE A COOL DUDE
HE LOOKS LIKE A BROWNISH J FASCIS
LUC LEMAY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE METAL MUSICIANS NOT ONLY DOES HE SEEM LIKE A SUPER CHILL GUY BUT I THINK HE HAS BEEN TRAINED TO COMPOSE CLASSICAL PIECES AS WELL BATTLE OF CHAMDO

I HAD THE CHANCE TO SEE GORGETS LIVE AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FEW BANDS THAT PRODUCES NEARLY THE SAME QUALITY THAT YOU WOULD GET ON THEIR RECORD I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I AM A LITTLE BIT OF A FAN BOY AND FREAKED OUT AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET HIM I'M SUCH A PUSSY
HE'S ALWAYS SEEMED REALLY GROUNDED AND WILLING TO BE OPEN WITH HIS IDEAS TO BETTER THE COMMUNITY SEE THOSE OLD VIDEOS HE DID WITH GUITAR ON HOW THEY WROTE PLAYED STUFF LIKE INVERTED

MINUTES AMATEUR
GOOD OLD RARE OBSCURE METAL ARCHIVES
BURIED AND FORGOTTEN

APT TITLE LOL GREAT SONG THO
GUESS PEOPLE DON'T LIKE BAND CAMP LINKS I JUST POSTED THIS A FEW HOURS AGO
HADN'T REALLY LISTENED TO ANY OF THEIR STUFF OUTSIDE OF THE SPLIT WITH PANOPTICON BUT THIS IS GREAT
THIS REALLY IS A HIGHLY OPINIONATED TOPIC SO YOU'RE GONNA GET SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE FOR ME PERSONALLY I'M QUITE A CALM GUY WHO RARELY GETS ANGRY AT ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THAT I DON'T LISTEN TO MUSIC TO LET OFF STEAM AT ALL I JUST ENJOY IT NEVER REALLY HAD THE THIS SONG MAKES ME WANNA PUNCH SOMEBODY FEELING

MOSTLY HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE MUSIC MAKES ME MOTIVATED TO DO STUFF I ALMOST ALWAYS LISTEN TO DEATH METAL WHILE WORKING OUT FOR EXAMPLE

I DO LISTEN TO DIFFERENT KINDS OF METAL IN DIFFERENT MOODS OF COURSE WHEN IT'S COLD BLACK FITS THE ATMOSPHERE BEST IN MY OPINION AND WHEN I'M TIRED IN THE EVENING AFTER WORK I CAN'T LISTEN TO ANY BRUTAL STUFF AND OFTEN PUT ON SOME IRON MAIDEN OR THE LIKE
I STARTED LISTENING TO METAL BECAUSE I LIKED THE MUSIC AND WELL I'M STILL HERE BECAUSE I LIKE THE MUSIC BUT SURE SOMETIMES IT HELPS GETTING RID OF ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AND SUCH FEELINGS
IT'S MORE LIKE A PUNCHING BAG THAN AN AURAL EXPERIENCE

THIS OUTLOOK IS A SYMPTOM OF NAMING METAL THE UMBRELLA COVERING THIS AND THIS

FOR SOME OF US THIS ISN'T A HOBBY
THERE WAS A BEST OF COMMENT A FEW WEEKS AGO EXPLAINING THE VALUE OF DEATH METAL

R TODAYILEARNED COMMENTS CONTEXT

AGAIN IT TALKED ABOUT THE PRIMAL NATURE OF THE MUSIC AND THE EMOTIONAL CATHARSIS OF THE MUSIC WHILE IT IS PERFECTLY OKAY TO EXPERIENCE MUSIC IN WHATEVER WAY YOU CHOOSE I FEEL THIS COMMENT GOT BEST OF BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T LISTEN TO TO DEATH METAL WANT TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS THIS SIMPLE IT REINFORCED THE STEREOTYPE OF THE LUNKHEAD STONER IN THE MEGADEATH SHIRT THAT JUST WANTS TO RAGE IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ENJOYMENT FOR RAVENOUS DEATH OR DEATH WITH HIGH OCCULT THEMES THERE IS NO MENTION OF RIFFS OR THE VARIETY OF THEMES FOUND IN HEAVY METAL I BELIEVE PEOPLE WANT IT TO BE SIMPLE SINCE IT DOES LOOK COMPLEX FROM THE OUTSIDE AND THUS THERE IS A TENDENCY BY OTHERS TO SUPPORT CONCLUSIONS THAT FIT THEIR OWN NARRATIVE

LISTENING TO THIS LIKE THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY SPECKS OF CATHARSIS RATHER JUST GEEKY ENJOYMENT FOR THE RIFFS AND LYRICAL MATTER
THE PRIMAL ANGER OUTLET SIDE OF METAL NEVER REALLY APPEALED TO ME THERE'S A LOT OF STYLES OF METAL THAT FOCUS ON IT AND OTHERS THAT DONT THE STYLE THEY CHOOSE AS AN OUTLET DOESN'T REALLY MATTER EVERYONE LISTENS TO MUSIC FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME CATHARSIS CHUCKING ON A DEICIDE ALBUM ESPECIALLY WHEN I GREW UP IN A CHRISTIAN HOUSEHOLD THAT WAS ALWAYS A GOOD WAY TO RELEASE SOME ENERGY WHILE PLAYING VIDEOGAMES

NOW I THINK I'VE KINDA SHIFTED GEAR I'M PRETTY PICKY WITH WHAT METAL I LIKE NOW WHICH FEELS PRETTY RESTRICTIVE I DEFINITELY LOVE BANDS LIKE SEPTICFLESH FOR A LOT MORE THAN JUST THE CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE OF LISTENING TO THEM ANY METAL BANDS WITH RELIGIOUS CONTENT LIKE BEHEMOTH BABUSHKA SCHAMMASCH ETC JUST FIT MY INTERESTS SO I CAN LISTEN TO THEM IN PRETTY MUCH ANY MOOD

DEALING WITH DEPRESSING AND ANXIETY AND ALL THAT FUN SHIT METAL CAN REALLY HELP SOMETIMES WITH THAT BUT THEN SO CAN A LOT OF SO I THINK IT'S JUST A THING MUSIC DOES IN GENERAL

BLACK METAL BANDS DO TEND TO ENERGISE ME BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT'S AN AGGRESSIVE THING I THINK THAT'S JUST WHAT GOOD FUCKING MUSIC DOES

THEN THERE'S STUFF LIKE ATHEIST PARTICULARLY ON ELEMENTS WHERE THEY JUST PRODUCED EXCELLENT MUSIC I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD REALLY ASSOCIATE THAT WITH AGGRESSION

EDIT I HOPE ALL THIS HAS MADE SENSE BECAUSE I'VE HAD QUITE A LOT OF VODKA M
I SEE HUGE SWATHES OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY ONLY GOT INTO METAL BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AND THE MUSIC RELIEVES THAT IN A SENSE AND NOW THEY'VE IT

NO ONE GOES YEAH I WAS REALLY INTO SLAYER ONE SUMMER I'VE NEVER MET THAT GUY I'VE ONLY MET THE GUY THAT'S GOT SLAYER CARVED ACROSS HIS CHEST
METAL FOR ME WAS NEVER AN OUTLET FOR DARKER FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS LIKE YOU DESCRIBE MY OUTLET FOR SUCH PAINFUL THINGS LIKE THAT TOOK THE FORM OF CLASSICAL MUSIC AND SCORES AND SOUNDTRACKS TO ANY OTHER MOVIE OR GAME THAT SHARED SIMILAR EMOTIONAL CONTENTION FINAL FANTASY GAMES AND THE LORD OF THE RINGS FILMS FOR EXAMPLE WERE MY EMOTIONAL ITEMS

WHEN IT CAME TO METAL I SIMPLY ADMIRED THE TECHNICAL SKILL ENERGY SPEED POWER AND ALL THAT OTHER SUCH STUFF THAT GOES INTO ALL OF MY CLASSICALLY INFLUENCED THINKING WOULD PICK APART GUITAR ARRANGEMENTS AND HOW METAL SUBVERTED A LOT OF MUSICAL RULES

FOR EXAMPLE THE PRESENCE OF A SECOND GUITAR CHANGES THE DYNAMIC OF ESTABLISHED ROCK STRUCTURE THE PERCUSSION IS OF COURSE HANDLED BY THE DRUMS BRINGING VOLUME AND CRESCENDO THE RHYTHMIC ASPECTS ARE CARRIED BY THE DRUMS AND THE BASS TOGETHER THE BASS AND SECONDARY GUITAR MANAGE TO FORM THE CHORD PROGRESSIONS AND BASIC STRUCTURE THE LEAD MELODIC ELEMENTS THEN ARE HANDLED BY THE PRIMARY GUITAR THIS ALLOWS THE VOCAL CONTENT TO BE ATMOSPHERIC AND LEND A NEW ELEMENT TO THE MUSIC BEHIND IT IT'S NOT RESTRICTED TO CARRYING MELODY

THEN I DISCOVERED AND CLASSICALLY STYLED METAL AND IT BLEW ME AWAY THE HUMAN DIGITAL VEIL ALBUM IS SOME OF THE MOST COMPLEX AND INCREDIBLE GUITAR WORK I'VE EVER HEARD BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME IS MY FAVORITE METAL GROUP BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH MUSICAL TALENT THAT BAND HAS JUMPING GENRE AND CONVENTION EVERY OTHER VERSE AND IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW BEAUTIFUL AND DIVERSE METAL CAN BE
I LIKE METAL FOR THE SKILLED INSTRUMENTATION I HONESTLY THINK LYRICS LIMIT THE POSSIBILITIES WITH METAL ESPECIALLY FUSION AND PROG METAL
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN IN IT FOR MUCH MORE THAN THE MUSIC TO BE HONEST IT'S SIMPLY THE ONLY GENRE THAT'S EVER REALLY RESONATED WITH ME I NEVER LISTENED TO A LOT OF MUSIC GROWING UP IT WASN'T UNTIL I SLOWLY GOT INTO METAL IN MY LATE TEENS THAT I WAS LISTENING TO THINGS REGULARLY I JUST ENJOYED THE TECHNICALITY OF THE MUSIC PLUS THERE'S JUST SOMETHING GENUINE TO THE MUSIC TO ME

I KNOW THIS APPLIES TO PLENTY OF GENRES BUT BECAUSE METAL ISN'T FASHIONABLE I GET THE FEEBLING THAT MOST BANDS KNOW THEY'RE NOT LIKELY TO BECOME SUPERSTARS AND ARE PLAYING THE MUSIC THAT THEY PLAY PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT'S THEIR PASSION AND THAT COMES THROUGH IN THE MUSIC

THERE ARE TIMES WHERE I'LL STICK SOMETHING MORE PROG OR SOFT ON WHEN I'M LOOKING TO FEEL A LITTLE MORE CHILLED BUT IT STOPS THERE REALLY BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN AN OUTLET FOR ANGST ANGER OR ALTHING LIKE THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT SURPRISES MY FRIENDS IN THEIR WORDS I DON'T LOOK LIKE A METAL PERSON AT ALL AND THEY FIND IT ODD THAT I CAN STICK ON ANGRY MUSIC FOR A CAR TRIP TRAIN RIDE OR JUST BACKGROUND MUSIC I JUST LIKE METAL BECAUSE IT'S FUN TO LISTEN TO WHETHER IT'S SOME SILLY TECH DEATH OR GETTING LOST IN SOME DOOM I RECOGNISE THE EMOTION IN THE MUSIC BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL THAT WAY MYSELF

THINKING ABOUT IT I THINK THE MOST EFFECT IT HAS ON ME IS THAT IT HAPPENS TO MAKE EXCELLENT PUMP UP MUSIC PARTICULARLY THE MORE UPBEAT MELODEATH STUFF LIKE BODO ALWAYS STICK SOME ON WHILE I WARM UP FOR A MATCH
BULLSHIT ART IN GENERAL COMES DOWN TO PEOPLE EXPRESSING THEMSELVES METAL IS NOT ANYTHING SPECIAL IN THAT REGARD ALL OF THE M PROUD TO BE A METALHEAD M STUFF MAKES ME SICK

I'M A DIEHARD METAL FAN AND IT MEANS INCREDIBLY MUCH TO ME EMOTIONALLY BUT SO DOES MUSIC FROM OTHER GENRES CLAIMING THAT METAL IS THIS UNTOUCHABLE THING IS IMMATURE AND NARROW MINDED

IF BEING A METALHEAD MEANS BEING IGNORANT ABOUT ANY OTHER ART FORMS I DON'T WANT TO BE ONE AND THAT'S COMING FROM YOUR STEREOTYPICAL LONG HAIRED LEATHER JACKET KIND OF GUY
IF SOMEONE SAYS THEY ARE JUST INTO METAL TO LET THEIR ANGER OUT THEY ARE A POSEUR
PEOPLE WHO JUST GOD MAD AS A TEENAGER AND HEARD A METALLICA SONG AT THE SAME TIME ON THE RADIO WHILE THEY WERE BREAKING STUFF ARE A VOCAL MINORITY

I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN WHERE THERE ARE PROBABLY ONLY LIKE METAL DUDES AND THEY HAVE BEEN METAL PRETTY MUCH THEIR ENTIRE LIVES OR AT LEAST AS FAR AS I'VE KNOWN THEM WE HAVE NO SCENE OR COMMUNITY THERE'S JUST ONE GUY WHO WORKS AT A LIQUOR STORE AND OWNS A LEATHER JACKET AND I'LL GO THERE TO BUY A BEER AND HE'LL SAY HEY NICE SLAYER SHIRT AND I'LL SAY THANKS ARE YOU LISTENING TO KING DIAMOND AWESOME YET WE ALL REMAIN FANS OF METAL FOR OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL REASONS

AS A COUNTERPOINT I ONCE WORKED AS A DISHWASHER IN THE COUNTY SEAT WITH THIS GUY FROM A SMALL TOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTY WHO WAS PRETTY INTO DENT AND OTHER CORE GENRES WE GOT ALONG BECAUSE I ENJOY DEATHCORE IN ADDITION TO OTHER FORMS OF METAL BUT I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE FROM YOUR TOWN LIKE METAL HIS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS I DON'T KNOW IT'S A SHITTY TOWN AND PEOPLE ARE PISSED OFF

THE GUYS IN MY TOWN WHO ARE INTO METAL EACH HAVE THEIR OWN GENRE THERE'S A DEPRESSED BLACK METAL GUY A DRUNK THRASH METAL GUY A PAGAN FOLK METAL GUY FOR ME I ENJOY IT BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY AND THE SINCERITY I ALSO ENJOY CLASSICAL MUSIC BECAUSE OF ITS COMPLEXITY AND SYMPHONIC CHARACTERISTICS SOMETHING WHICH I FEEL IS CERTAINLY PARALLELED BY METAL WITH ITS FREQUENT USE OF MULTIPLE GUITARS AND COMPLEX MELODIES

I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING HERE IS DOES A METAL FAN FIT A PARTICULAR ARCHETYPE WHEN WHAT YOU SHOULD TRULY BE ASKING IS DO DIFFERENT GENRES OF METAL APPEAL DO DIFFERENT ARCHETYPES OF PEOPLE

THAT BEING SAID EVEN THOUGH I LOVE DEATHCORE AND I THINK IT'S SAD THAT CORE IN GENERAL GETS A BAD RAP THERE WAS DEFINITELY A SUBCULTURE OF METALCORE FANS IN MY AREA FOR ABOUT A DECADE WHEN IT WAS TRENDY TO BE A SCENE KID MORON HOWEVER THOSE SAME PEOPLE ARE ALL NOW JUST FOLLOWING THE NEWEST TREND WHICH THEY BELIEVE MAKES THEM ALTERNATIVE TO THE NORM BLINDED FROM THE REALIZATION THAT THEY'RE MERELY PARALLELING NORMALCY WITH THEIR SPOON-FED CUSTOMS SO YEAH THERE WERE DEFINITELY A LOT OF DOUCHEBAGS INTO METALCORE BUT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INTO FUCKING POLKA IF MTV TOLD THEM IT WAS EDGY AND
POR QUE NO LOS DOS
I AM INTO METAL FOR THE SAME REASON I BUY ANYTHING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF DRAGONS ON THE COVER
FOR ME IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT EMOTION AND GOOD SONGWRITING THIS CAN APPLY TO ANY GENRE OF MUSIC BUT METAL HAS THAT EXTRA BIT OF AURAL AESTHETIC THAT JUST GETS IT RIGHT FOR ME

I'VE NEVER THOUGHT THAT FLASHY MUSICIANSHIP AND HIGHLY ADVANCED SKILLS WERE SOLELY NECESSARY FOR GOOD METAL IT'S PROBABLY WHY I LOVE DOOM SO MUCH OFTEN A SIMPLE MINOR CHORD PROGRESSION CAN EVOKE A LOT MORE FEELING THAN A GUITARIST NOODLING AWAY AT THE PHRYGIAN SCALE BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THE OPPOSITE IS NOT TRUE

I LISTEN TO A DECENT VARIETY OF MUSIC WHICH THE ABOVE SENTIMENT CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO IF I LISTENED TO MUSIC SOLELY FOR ITS MUSICIANSHIP I'D BE A BORED MANUAL BESIDES ANGER ISN'T THE ONLY EMOTION THAT METAL FEEDS I'M JUST AS PLEASED LISTENING TO SOMETHING LIKE CARPATHIAN FOREST IF I'M SEETHING WITH ANGER OR IF I'M BLISSFULLY ELATED
IT'S FOR BOTH DEFINITELY FOR THE GOOD MUSIC ITSELF AND FOR THE FEELING IT BRINGS AND PEOPLE ARE INTO METAL BECAUSE THEY LIKE IT FOR SIMILAR REASONS

THERE ARE SO MANY KINDS OF METALHEADS SO PEOPLE CAN'T REALLY BE PUT INTO SOLID GROUPS WE AS A COMMUNITY SHOULDN'T CATEGORIZE METAL FANS AS BEING OPPOSITE GROUPS TO EACH OTHER AND I WOULDN'T LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD TREATING US LIKE WE ARE SOME KIND OF A DIRECT OPPOSITE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE I LIKE TO THINK ALL OF US BEING EQUAL IN THAT SENSE THAT WE THINK WE BELONG TO A COMMUNITY AND WE TREAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT DESPITE ALMOST NEVER AGREEING ON THE TOPIC OF MUSIC ITSELF WE INSIDE THIS BUBBLE OF METAL COMMUNITY GENERALLY ARGUE ABOUT THINGS AND NOT AGAINST THE PERSON DIRECTLY THAT KEEPS THE DISCUSSION CLASSY AND TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD WE LOOK UNITED IN OUR THING
I BET MOST OF US HAVE STARTED FROM SOMETHING CONSIDERED AS MAINSTREAM BEFORE GETTING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE MUSIC AND ALL THE VARIOUS GENRES THERE ARE THAT'S WHY METALHEADS SHOULDN'T DISMISS THE GREAT EFFECT OF MAINSTREAM METAL I COULD POINT OUT DISTURBED BEING ONE OF THOSE GATEWAY BANDS FOR MY GENERATION IT BRINGS PEOPLE TO THE MUSIC AFTER ALL ALSO NEW BANDS WANT TO DIFFERENTIATE THEMSELVES FROM THE GROUP SO THERE ARE INTERESTING NEW AND CREATIVE BANDS TO BE FOUND CONTINUOUSLY

THE FEELINGS ARE INDEED IMPORTANT I CONSIDER MYSELF AS A CALM PERSON LIKE MANY OTHERS DO METAL DEFINITELY HELPS THAT HELPS KEEPING THE CALM ADDITUDE LATELY THOUGH I'VE FOUND OUT THAT THE MORE DEPRESSING STUFF DEATHCORE BLACK METAL DOESN'T HELP KEEPING BAD FEELINGS AWAY MAYBE I'VE GROWN A BIT FROM THE WORST TEENAGE YEARS WHEN I FACED SOME HARDSHIPS IN LIFE NOW WHEN THINGS ARE BETTER FOR ME PERSONALLY I ENJOY MORE OF THE TECHNICAL AND ATMOSPHERIC ASPECTS OF METAL I'M STILL A BIG FAN OF A VARIETY OF GENRES I ENJOY NEW BLACK METAL TECHNICAL DEATH METAL AND SOMEWHAT SOFTER AND COMPLEX INDUSTRIAL METAL EQUALLY AS WELL AS METALCORE AND SOME OF THE MORE PROGRESSIVE STUFF OF COURSE I'VE HAD TO DIG DEEP LISTEN TO A LOT OF THE OLDER STUFF TO UNDERSTAND THE CORNERSTONE BANDS OF EVERY GENRE BUT NEW MUSIC REALLY KEEPS THINGS FRESH I ENJOY DISCOVERING BANDS BY READING ONLINE MUSIC SITES AND SCROLLING THROUGH PONTIFY

ONE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THE REALLY VOCAL SO CALLED ELITISTS I DON'T WANT TO CALL THEM MINORITY OR MAJORITY THEY ARE EQUAL FANS OF MUSIC STILL BUT THE NEGATIVITY TOWARDS BANDS WHO DON'T STAY THE SAME IS SOMEWHAT BOTHERING I AS A PERSON WANT TO GO FORWARD NOT STAGNATE MY INTERESTS GROW WITH ME AND I KEEP UNDERSTANDING NEW THINGS EVERY DAY IT'S NATURAL THAT BANDS AND ARTISTS WHO DO THEIR THING OUT OF THEIR PASSION FOR MUSIC PROGRESS AND CHANGE CHANGE IS INEVITABLE THE GENERAL NEGATIVITY AND THE EXPECTATIONS OF BANDS NOT CHANGING THEIR ORIGINAL SOUND IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DISMISSED AS A DIRECT INSULT TO TRUE PASSION AND ARTISTIC CREATIVITY MANY OF MY FAVOURITE BANDS HAVE CHANGED DURING THE YEARS I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE THEM ANYMORE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T HAVE TO HATE THEM FOR DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AFTER ALL SHOULDN'T METAL BE ALL ABOUT NOT GIVING A FUCK WHAT OTHERS EXPECT YOU TO BE AND VICE VERSA YOU YOURSELF CAN LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE NOT HAVING TO COMFORT TO OTHERS EXPECTATIONS
DO YOU THINK IT'S GENERALLY THE CASE THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY ONLY INTO METAL FOR THE SCENE ASPECT OR JUST THE OR IS THAT JUST THE VOCAL MINORITY

THESE ARE DEFINITELY THE ONES THAT STAND OUT THE CORPORATE GUY WITH HIS HAIR SLICKED BACK YOU DON'T IMAGINE HIM LISTENING TO DEICIDE BUT THOSE KINDS OF INVISIBLE METALHEADS ARE PROBABLY MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE ONES WITH GOATEES LONG HAIR AND LEATHER JACKETS

FOR ME PERSONALLY METAL IS REALLY ABOUT BOTH THE MUSIC AND THE FEELING I USED TO LISTEN TO A WHOLE VARIETY OF METAL PROBABLY BECAUSE WE LIKE TO FIT IN A GROUP WHEN YOUNGER BUT THESE PAST FEW YEARS I'VE BECOME VERY PICKY I DON'T RESTRICT MYSELF TO A SINGLE GENRE THERE'S MUSIC THAT I LIKE AND MUSIC THAT I DON'T LIKE BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THAT ONE ITCH THAT NO KIND OF MUSIC BUT METAL CAN SCRATCH
I'M DEFINITELY A MIX OF BOTH I LOVE SITTING DOWN WITH MY EYES SHUT AND LISTENING TO WHAT'S GOING ON LOOKING FOR ALL THE CLEVER LITTLE LICKS TEMPO CHANGES DRUM FILLS AND GENERAL MUSICIANSHIP THAT GOES INTO A SOLID METAL TRACK

HOWEVER IF I'VE HAD A SHIT DAY OR SOME BAD NEWS I TURN THAT SHIT UP TO AND IT'S UNBELIEVABLY CATHARTIC METAL CAN MAKE ME FEEL STUFF NO OTHER GENRE CAN AND I LOVE IT FOR THAT TOO
I STARTED LISTENING TO METAL BECAUSE I WANTED TO LISTEN TO SOMETHING HEAVY IT WASN'T BECAUSE I WAS ANGRY AND DEPRESSED THOUGH I WAS ANGRY AND DEPRESSED TODAY I LISTEN TO METAL BECAUSE I LIKE IT I DO LIKE HOW ANGRY AND VIOLENT IT CAN BE AND SOMETIMES I LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE I WANT TO LISTEN TO SOMETHING MORE AGGRESSIVE BUT SOMETIMES I LISTEN TO CERTAIN CLASSICAL COMPOSERS BECAUSE I WANT AGGRESSIVE MUSIC AS WELL

BUT METAL CAN ALSO BE BEAUTIFUL I FIND

I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER OUTGROW METAL OR STOP LISTENING TO IT IF I'M DEALING WITH MY DEPRESSION BETTER
I THINK THE TECHNICAL ABILITY THAT METAL DEMANDS FOR BOTH INSTRUMENTS AND VOCALS IS WHAT ATTRACTS A LOT PEOPLE I KNOW THAT MUSICALLY THE GUITAR PLAYING IN METAL IS SOME OF THE BEST THAT THERE IS
I STARTED LISTENING TO METAL AT A VERY YOUNG AGE THANKS MOM AND DAD AND I STILL DO BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO I ENJOY THE MUSIC I ALSO ENJOY THE TALENT BEHIND THE MUSIC MY EARLY YEARS WERE DEFINED BY RUSH AND MEGADEATH

THEN AROUND MY SOPHOMORE YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL I WAS INTRODUCED TO A BAND CALLED AGALLOCH AND IT COMPLETELY FLIPPED MY MUSICAL EXPERIENCE UPSIDE DOWN FROM THEN ON I WAS AND STILL AM ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR BANDS THAT COULD INCITE EMOTION THE WAY AGALLOCH COULD
I THINK WORDS ALWAYS FALL SHORT WHEN TRYING TO EXPLAIN STUFF LIKE THIS BUT I'LL TRY

METAL FOR ME IS BEAUTY POWER AND PLEASURE EVEN WHEN IT'S UGLY IT STILL MOVES ME IT GIVES ME ENERGY I'M NOT SURE IF I GET CATHARSIS OR NOT BUT WHAT I KNOW IS THAT IT CAN CERTAINLY RESONATE WITH BAD OR NEGATIVE FEELINGS SO THE LYRICAL SUBJECTS ARE NO COINCIDENCE AND WHEN I'M HAVING ISSUES FEELING PLEASURE METAL GIVES ME THAT
THAT FEELING WHEN LISTENING TO METAL IS SATAN I LISTEN TO METAL TO FEEL SATAN PERMEATE FROM MY CORE
PERSONALLY I'M INTO METAL FOR THE MUSIC THE MESSAGE IT CONVEYS POLITICAL FOR EXAMPLE AND IT'S ALL I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO

MY VIEW IS THIS

WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GO TO A R B CONCERT OR A POP CONCERT AT THESE CONCERTS THE MUSIC COMES FROM A COMPUTER NOT TALENTED MUSICIANS PLAYING AN INSTRUMENT IF I GOT TO A METAL SHOW YOU SEE THE GUITARISTS SHREDDING YOU SEE THE DRUMMER PLAYING HIS HEART OUT AND YOU SEE THE VOCALIST PUTTING ALL HIS EMOTION INTO THE LYRICS

METAL IS ALL ABOUT TALENT AND IT IS SOMETHING I APPRECIATE AND THE MESSAGES THEY TEND TO CONVEY ARE ONES I AGREE WITH IN SOME WAY

EXAMPLE

WHY WOULD I PAY TO SEE THIS WHEN I COULD PAY TO SEE THIS
I FIND WHEN I LISTEN TO METAL IT IS A MIX OF THE TWO TOGETHER I FIND WHEN I AM IN A MOOD OR CERTAIN HEADSPACE FOR A CERTAIN STYLE OF METAL IT MAKES ME APPRECIATE THE MUSICAL TALENT THEY HAVE AS WELL AS ACCENTUATING THE FEELING THE COMES FROM THE MUSIC

THERE ARE SO MANY KINDS OF METAL THAT I FIND THERE IS A GENRE FOR EVERY SITUATION GOING SKIING STONER METAL LONG DRIVE IN THE DARK BLACK METAL GETTING DRUNK THRASH METAL THE LIST GOES ON AND ON
BACK WHEN I STARTED LISTENING TO METAL IT WAS MOSTLY ABOUT FINDING MY PLACE IN THE WORLD IT'S NOT ANGER IT'S JUST MTH MISSING METAL GAVE ME SOME POINTERS THAT IT'S OK AND MANY PEOPLE FEEL THIS WAY THAT THE WORLD IS MUCH DEEPER THAN IT LOOKS THAT GOT ME INTO HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY

PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK METAL IS ABOUT ANGER IS IT YES BUT IMO IS SORT OF ANGER THAT IT'S OK TO BE ANGRY IT'S OK TO NOT FIT IN IT'S OK TO NOT FOLLOW THE SUITE AND DON'T MATCH FEELS OF PEOPLE AROUND YOU PERSONALLY I THINK PEOPLE WHO SAY METAL IS ABOUT ANGER JUST DON'T GET WHAT IT REALLY IS YES SOME LATE MODES OF METAL MAY HAVE NO LAYER BEYOND THAT BUT ALL THE LEGENDARY STUFF BIO IS ANGER IRON MAIDEN IS ANGER BLIND GUARDIAN IS ANGER COME ON EVEN MOST THRASH BANDS HAVE MUCH MORE GOING ON

CURRENTLY I LISTEN TO METAL FOR SEVERAL REASONS YES I APPRECIATE SKILLS AND THE SOUND ITSELF I GOT MANY MEMORIES ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC BANDS AND SONGS TOO AND WHENEVER I NEED TO CONTEMPLATE ABOUT OUTSIDE WORLD BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE ANGRY TO LISTEN TO METAL IN FACT WHEN I'M ANGRY I FREQUENTLY LISTEN TO DIFFERENT MUSIC
I STARTED LISTENING TO METAL EXCLUSIVELY BECAUSE I LIKED THE MUSIC

I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT A HUGE SCENE OF HEADBANGERS EXISTED BACK THEN THINK LATE EARLY I WAS ABOUT YEARS OLD AT THE TIME

WHEN I REALIZED WHAT A HUGE SCENE OF DEDICATED FANS HID BEHIND THE GENRE I LIKED IT EVEN MORE AND I LIKED THE LOOKS TOO SO I GREW MY HAIR LONG AND STARTED WEARING AND THE LIKE AND I STILL LOVE IT TODAY

SAME FOR THE MUSIC STILL LOVE IT

FOR ME THE ASPECT OF RELIEVING STRESS THROUGH METAL IS NOT REALLY THAT IMPORTANT

WELL TO PUT IT DIFFERENTLY IT IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT BUT I'VE USED OTHER MUSIC GENRES FOR THAT PURPOSE IN THE PAST SO FOR ME IT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO METAL

WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT METAL THOUGH IS THE HUGE AMOUNT OF THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND CAN FILL MANY DIFFERENT ROLES FOR ME

FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I FEEL STRESSED AND WANT TO RELAX I MOSTLY LISTEN TO DEATH METAL WHEN I'M DOWN I LISTEN TO POWER METAL TO CHEER ME UP

SOME FRIENDS OF MINE WHO ARE INTO THE SCENE THINK SIMILARLY OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY KNOW THAT FOR SURE BUT AT LEAST I DON'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE WHO THEIR METAL
DEPENDS GREATLY ON THE MOOD I'M IN WHEN I LISTEN SOMETIMES I PUT ON SOME SYL FOR THE MACHINE GUN GUITARS AND DRUMS BECAUSE I WANT TO GET MY FRUSTRATION OUT SOMETIMES I'LL PUT ON SOME DT FOR THE TECHNICALITY OF IT AND SOMETIMES IT'LL BE MAIDEN FOR THE LYRICS THE MOODS THE FEELING OF AN EPIC CAVALCADE

THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THE GENRE JUST LIKE CLASSICAL OR JAZZ IT IS SO VARIED AND WIDE THAT YOU ARE BOUND TO FIND SOMETHING TO YOUR TASTE
THERE IS A CARTOON OR SUPERHERO TYPE OF THING TO METAL THAT COMBINED WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF TEENAGE ANGER LYRICAL CONTENT CAUSES A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GROW OUT OF THE GENRE

IMO THEY NEVER WERE TOO DEEP INTO THE GENRE TO BEGIN WITH THEY'RE CORRECT IN THEIR OPINION BUT ONLY ABOUT THOSE SPECIFIC BANDS THE GENRE IS SO MASSIVE THAT THERE'S FAR MORE TO IT THAN THAT SOME BANDS ARE POLITICAL SOME ADDRESS SOCIAL ISSUES OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SPIRITUALITY SELF CONFIDENCE ETC IT'S NOT ALL RAGE AND ANGER AND DUNGEONS DRAGONS FANTASY OR SEX

I LISTEN FOR THE SKILL OF THE MUSICIANS AS INSTRUMENTALISTS VOCALISTS AND SONGWRITERS I LISTEN FOR THE EMOTIONS THEIR MUSIC MAKES ME FEEL SOMETIMES FOR WHEN I NEED A POSITIVE ADJUSTMENT TO MY ATTITUDE OR SOMETIMES WHEN I WANT TO GET AN ADRENALINE RUSH FROM THAT FAVORITE RIFF AND SOMETIMES I CAN'T DEAL WITH METAL AND NEED THE BEATLES OR IMOGEN HEAP FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
I THINK THERE'S A GOOD MIX OF PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THE SCENE THE MUSICALITY AND A COMBINATION OF BOTH COMING FROM A CLASSICAL JAZZ BACKGROUND I FIND PLAYING METAL IS CHALLENGING AND THERE'S JUST A DIFFERENT ENERGY YOU CAN TAKE FROM IT

THE FELLOWSHIP IN THE METAL SCENE IS RIVALED BY NONE AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERVALUE THE SOCIAL ASPECT OF OUR MUSIC PLUS EVERYONE KNOWS THE DANCE
I STARTED TO LISTEN METAL BECAUSE A FRIEND OF MINE SHOWED ME THE WAY I COULD NEVER STAND THE GRUNTING AND SHOUTING THOUGHT THE DRUMMERS WERE ONLY BANGING AS HARD AND AS FAST AS THEY COULD I THOUGHT IT WAS MUSIC FOR PEOPLE WHO INDEED SEEK THIS GENRE AS AN OUTLET FOR HATE LONELINESS ETC AFTER MY FRIEND SHOWED ME THAT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE I GAVE IT A TRY AND BOY WAS I WRONG I NEVER KNEW THERE WERE SO MANY GENRES WITHIN METAL ITSELF FOR ME I LISTEN IT FOR BOTH REASONS NOW I THINK SOMETIMES I PUT ON A HEAVY SONGS WITH THE REEP ST AND DARKEST LYRICS AND GRUNTS JUST TO GET SOME STRESS OR IRRITATION OUT OTHER TIMES I LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE I JUST LOVE THE MUSIC BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN I ALWAYS LISTEN IT BECAUSE THE RITHE USE OF INSTRUMENTS VARIATION IN STYLE AND MANY MORE THINGS JUST AMAZE ME AS MUSIC ITSELF I LIKE TO REFER A LOT TO THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CLASSICAL MUSIC AND METAL GIVES ME THE SAME FEELING
I THINK FOR ME THE MAIN APPEAL OF METAL IS THAT IT JUST SOUNDS BIG THERE'S A LARGER THAN LIFE ASPECT TO IT THAT YOU JUST CAN'T GET OUT OF A TYPICAL INDIE ROCK SONG FOR EXAMPLE NOTHING AGAINST INDIE ROCK IT'S JUST GOING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND FURTHERMORE THERE IS LOTS OF GOOD STUFF IN THE GENRE METAL IS OFTEN MORE COMPLICATED AMBITIOUS DYNAMIC AND JUST GENERALLY GIVES A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE COMPARED TO ANY OTHER GENRE INCIDENTALLY I ENJOY POST ROCK BANDS LIKE SWANS OR GODSPEED YOU BLACK EMPEROR FOR SIMILAR REASONS BEING LOUD AND VIOLENT IS MORE SECONDARY TO ME

THAT'S NOT TAKING AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT THERE'S APPEAL IN SOMETHING MORE RAW AND IN YOUR FACE THOUGH EVEN THE STUFF I'D LISTEN TO THAT IS MORE IN THAT CATEGORY SUCH AS SYL OR DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN STILL HAVE THE SAME SORT OF CHARACTERISTICS BIG COMPLICATED AMBITIOUS DYNAMIC
YO BRAZIL THOUGHT IT MAY MEAN SOMETHING TO YOUR QUESTION

I STARTED LISTENING TO METAL WHEN I WAS AT FIRST IT WAS TO GIVE MY LIFE SOME MEANING ALONG WITH THE OBVIOUS BELONGING FEELING HOWEVER NOW I DON'T GIVE A SHIT I LISTEN TO METAL BECAUSE THAT'S THE MUSIC I ENJOY THAT'S THE MUSIC I SEARCH FOR WHENEVER I WANT SOMETHING NEW SURE I'M PRETTY ECLECTIC AND BELIEVE AS A MUSICIAN WANNABE I HAVE TO LISTEN TO DIFFERENT STUFF BUT METAL IS AS I LIKE TO CALL IT THE MUSIC I LISTEN TO IN MY NATURAL STATE BY THAT I MEAN THAT WHILE I MAY ENJOY LISTENING TO MY FRIENDS ALTERNATIVE BANDS I WON'T LISTEN TO THEM UNLESS SOMEONE RECOMMENDS THEM TO ME OR SOMETHING IN THOSE LINES SURE THERE ARE TIMES WHERE METAL IS THE PUNCHING BAG BUT ASIDE FROM THAT METAL IS REALLY COOL MUSIC IF YOU BELIEVE I'M WRONG TO LISTEN TO EVERYTHING AND NOT BE A HEADBANDER FINE I DON'T GIVE A DAMN I LISTEN TO THE MUSIC BECAUSE I LIKE THE MUSIC NOT BECAUSE I LOOK GOOD IN BLACK LEATHER IF I EVER FEEL LIKE LISTENING TO MAROON I'LL LISTEN TO IT WITHOUT FAKING IT UNDER MY BADASS FACE

I HOPE THIS NEVER HAPPENS THE BAND IS SO BAD

THAT'S MY VIEW ON THE SUBJECT OP TOOK ME A WALK TO COLLEGE TO PULL IT OUT HOPE IT GIVES A DIFFERENT VIEW ON THE SUBJECT
I ACTUALLY GOT INTO METAL FOR THE OPPOSITE REASON I'VE ALWAYS LIKE VERY REFLECTIVE MUSIC WITH LARGE DYNAMIC SHIFTS A LOT OF METAL BANDS COVER A LARGE RANGE OF DYNAMICS MORESO THAN ROCK COUNTRY OR JAZZ AND GIVE A PRETTY UNIQUE LISTENING EXPERIENCE BANDS LIKE JAPETH AND DREAM THEATER REALLY SHOWED ME HOW MUCH GROUND MUSIC CAN COVER DYNAMICALLY

I GUESS WHEN I WAS PANTER WAS MY FAVORITE BAND THOUGH SO THERE PROBABLY WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS IN IT FOR THE SCENE
I STARTED IN METAL IN MY ELDER BROTHER CAME BACK FROM UNIVERSITY WITH A HUGE RECORD COLLECTION AND INFLUENCED BY HIM AND WHAT I HEARD I MOVED FROM ROCK TO METAL TO THRASH TO DEATH METAL AND EVENTUALLY BLACK METAL AND GRINDCORE SINCE THEN I'VE KEPT TO THE SOUNDS I ENJOYED AND HAVE NO PROBLEM LISTENING TO ANYTHING IT'S AS LONG AS THE MUSIC OR VOCALS PREFERABLY BOTH HAVE SOMETHING TO THEM A MEANING A STORY A LESSON AN OPINION WHICH DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RIGHT
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE USE MUSIC TO GET OUT THEIR ANGER THE ONLY PLACE I DID WHEN I WAS IN MY WAS AT A GIG IN THE MOSH OR STAGE DIVING BEING ABLE TO REACT TO WHAT I HEARD AND ENJOYED
AS LONG AS YOU ENJOY IT WHAT'S THE ISSUE
AS I GREW UP THE MUSIC I LISTENED TO GOT MORE COMPLEX AND MORE DIFFICULT TO PLAY ON DRUMS AND GUITAR AND BASS EVENTUALLY I STARTED LISTENING TO MUSIC WHERE THE VOCALIST OCCASIONALLY GROWLED OR SCREAMED AS I GOT USED TO THAT SOUNDS I STARTED LISTENING TO BANDS THAT PRETTY MUCH ONLY DID THAT NOW IM HERE A TAUR METALHEAD BECAUSE EVERY ASPECT OF THE MUSIC VOCALS AND LYRICS BRINGS OUT ALL OF MY EMOTION
I REALLY LOVE BOTH HONESTLY THE FEELING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME IF YOU'RE PUTTING OUT UNINSPIRED GOOD MUSIC I EAST LATEST ALBUM WHICH HAD GREAT WRITING BUT BAD LYRICS IT'LL KILL IT FOR ME REALLY DARK AND UNORGANIZED CHAOS WHICH MOST WOULD CONSIDER CRAP REALLY INTRIGUES ME SET TITLED HAS BOTH OF THIS ELEMENTS TO ME BEING ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ALBUMS EVER FIRST IS ALSO LIKE THIS
NOT ALL METAL IS ANGRY I THINK STUFF LIKE FOR ME LIKE SLIPKNOT THAT APPEALED TO MY ANGST SIDE I STILL LOVE IT BUT IT DEFINITELY APPEALS TO THOSE MOODS

POWER METAL FOLK METAL PROG METAL ARE EXAMPLES OF SUB GENRES THAT DON'T NECESSARILY APPEAL TO MY ANGRY SIDE PRIMARILY
I GREW UP LISTENING TO S METAL WITH MY DAD AS A S KID THEN I BRANCHED OUT AND STARTED LISTENING TO METALLICA MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN BUT I ENJOYED THE HEAVIER RIFFS AND MORE POWERFUL SOUND THAN THE LIKES OF VAN HALEN AND WHITESNAKE DON'T GET ME WRONG THOSE TWO BANDS ARE STILL AWESOME THEN I STARTED LISTENING MORE INTENTLY TO OLDER METAL BANDS SUCH AS RAINBOW ZEPPELIN AND SABBATH THEN ONE DAY IT ALL CHANGED I HEARD A SONG CALLED BLACK ICE OFF AN ALBUM CALLED AN EVENING WITH JOHN PETRUCCI AND JORDAN RUDEST THE TECHNICAL PROWESS SHOWED BY THOSE TWO MUSICIANS IN THAT NEARLY MINUTE SONG INTRODUCED ME TO A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF MUSIC AND EVENTUALLY TO A NEW WORLD OF METAL AS DT HAS BECOME MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BAND

THAT BRINGS ME TO AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION I'VE BEEN TO A DREAM THEATER CONCERT AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR FOR ALMOST A DECADE NOW THEY'VE HAD QUITE THE SWATH OF OPENING ACTS FROM TRIVIUM TO JAPETH TO ZAPPA PLAYS ZAPPA TO ANIMALS AS LEADERS AND I'LL TELL YOU EVERY CONCERT GROUP IS DIFFERENT THE OPENING ACTS ALWAYS BRING IN SUCH DIFFERENT GROUPS I REMEMBER DURING THE JAPETH SET THERE WAS A GUY IN FRONT OF ME AT THE ORPHEUM IN BOSTON WITH HAIR DOWN TO HIS KNEES AND HE HAD A FOOT CIRCLE OF SPACE AROUND HIM BECAUSE HE WAS HELICOPTERING HIS HAIR AND PEOPLE WERE JUST LETTING HIM GO BUT WHEN DT CAME ON THE FANS STAND THERE AND WATCH AND LISTEN THERE ISN'T A LOT OF HEAD-HANGING EXCEPT FOR THOSE SONGS THAT ALMOST REQUIRE IT THOSE ARE MY METAL HEADS THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THE VIRTUOSITY FOR WHAT IT IS AMAZING MUSICIANS PLAYING AMAZING MUSIC AT AN AMAZING LEVEL AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED UNLESS YOU GO TO CLASSICAL MUSIC THE AND EVEN THRASH AND HEAVY METAL SCENES ARE THE ONLY PLACES YOU CAN FIND MUSICIANS WHO ARE TRULY AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME WITH NO ONE AROUND TO SLOW THEM DOWN OR TELL THEM THEY'RE WRONG

SO NO PEOPLE ARE NOT ONLY INTO METAL FOR THE SCENE AND HEAD-HANGING THAT'S THE VOCAL MINORITY I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF CONCERTS IN MY LIFE AND THE METAL FANS ARE ALWAYS THE NICEST AND MOST MUSICALLY ADEPT OF ANY FANS I MEET THEY DO LOVE IT FOR THE MUSIC AND TECHNICALITY YOU JUST NEED TO FIND THEM
FOR ME MUSICIANSHIP FEELING
FOR ME IT WAS NEVER REALLY ABOUT THE ANGER I DIDN'T AND STILL DON'T CONSIDER MOST METAL TO BE ANGRY PASSIONATE YES POWERFUL YES ANGRY LESS SO THOUGH IT CERTAINLY STILL EXIST AT TIMES MAYBE THAT'S JUST CAUSE I HAVE NO PROBLEM LISTENING TO CORE GENRES THAT EVERYONE EXCEPT METAL HEADS CALL METAL AS WELL

FOR ME AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP WITH A LOT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC TRAINING I JUST DON'T FEEL THE DRAW TO LISTEN TO METAL FOR ITS ANGER I DON'T HEAR MUCH OF THE ANGER AT ALL
I JUST FIND HEAVY RIFFS AND CRUSHING GUITAR TONES TO BE VERY SATISFYING I LISTEN TO A LOT OF TECHY DRUM AND BASS FOR THE SAME REASON
ALWAYS LOVED THE MUSIC OVER TIME MY TASTES HAVE SOFTENED A BIT AND I CAN'T REALLY DEAL WITH SUPER INTENSE HEAVY STUFF WITHOUT IT HAVING SOME SORT OF MELODIC ELEMENT

I MEAN GREAT AND EVERYTHING BUT RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE I WAY PREFER THE LIGHT AND SHADE TO SOMETHING LIKE SILKWORK I'VE JUST GOTTEN INTO GOAJIRO VIA MAGMA AND WENT BACK TO L'ENFANT SAUVAGE AND LOVE THEM BOTH JUST GOT THE WAY OF ALL FLESH JUST YESTERDAY AND HAVE TO ADMIT I'M NOT STRUCK ON IT NEED THOSE MELODIES MAN THEY JUSTIFY THE HEAVINESS


SURE IT'S AN OUTLET FOR MY FRUSTRATIONS BUT WALL TO WALL NOISE IS NOT MY THING IT NEEDS TO BE MEASURED IF YOU HAVE WHITE AND BLACK YOU HAVE A CONTRAST IF YOU HAVE ALL WHITE OR ALL BLACK THEN HALF OF THE PICTURE IS MISSING

THAT'S MY OPINION ANYWAY AND OF COURSE IT'S ALL HORSES FOR COURSES REALLY
I WAS A PRETTY EVEN BALANCED KID WHEN I GOT INTO METAL I WAS AROUND TEN OR ELEVEN I WAS A HUGE ART NERD AND I LOVED THE HORROR AND FANTASY ALBUM COVERS TURNS OUT I LOVED THE MUSIC TOO I WAS A LITTLE TOO YOUNG TO HAVE MUCH TO BE PISSED OVER

NOW AS AN ADULT I LOVE METAL FOR THE MUSIC BUT STILL DIG THE DARK IMAGERY WITH THAT SAID A LITTLE FUCKING HOSTILE GOES A LONG WAY WHEN YOU'RE PISSED AND GET IN YOUR CAR
HMM I THINK THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT SHOWCASES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASUAL MUSIC LISTENERS AND THOSE WHO LISTEN MORE ACTIVELY REALLY I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WE ALL LISTEN TO ANY KIND OF MUSIC FOR THE FEELING BUT CASUAL LISTENERS GENERALLY ONLY SEE MUSIC AS INVOLVING SIMPLE EMOTIONS AND IF SOMETHING IS LOUD AND HARSH IT MUST BE ANGRY OR IF SOMETHING IS DANCY AND UPBEAT IT MUST BE HAPPY THIS IS FINE BUT IT'S VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN LISTENING INTENTLY TO A SONG AND INTERPRETING THAT FEELING TO BE AKIN TO THE FRIGID DARKNESS OF NORTHERN WINTERS CASUAL LISTENERS ALSO AREN'T GOING TO ANALYZE THE MUSIC ITSELF THAT MUCH IT'LL BE LIMITED TO SIMPLE OBSERVATIONS LIKE THIS GROOVE FEELS GOOD OR WOW THAT'S A FAST GUITAR SOLO IN GENERAL I IMAGINE YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO FIND SERIOUS ACTIVE LISTENERS THE FURTHER YOU DELVE INTO ANY GENRE WHILE WHEN DISCUSSING MORE MAINSTREAM ACTS YOU'RE LIKELY TO RUN INTO LOTS OF CASUAL ONES

AS A MUSICIAN MYSELF AND SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN EXPLORING EVERY BIT OF METAL I CAN GET MY HANDS ON SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL I DO BOTH SOMETIMES EVEN IF A BAND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING SPECTACULARLY INTERESTING IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT ENERGY IT FEELS GOOD SIMILARLY EVEN IF I DON'T NECESSARILY ENJOY CERTAIN ASPECTS OF A BANDS SOUND I CAN APPRECIATE THE MUSICIANSHIP OR WRITING IF IT IS EXCEPTIONAL
MY GIRLFRIEND AND I HAVE BEEN LONG TIME METAL LOVERS AND WE LISTEN FOR BOTH ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE FEELS BUT WE DIDN'T GET INTO IT BECAUSE WE WERE ANGRY WE LIKE THE CRUSHING RAWNESS AND THE POWER BEHIND IT IT'S FUN COOL AND GIVES ME SOMETHING TO ASPIRE TO AS A MUSICIAN OF COURSE IT'S A GO TO WHEN FEELING UPSET BUT WE DON'T RAGE THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT GROW OUT OF IT ARE LIKELY THE SAME KIND THAT LIKE HARDCORE AND SHIT LIKE THAT WHO'VE STATED TO ME IN DISCUSSION THAT THEY LIKE BEING PUNCHED KICKED IN THE FACE AT A SHOW WHAT EVEN

OUR LOVE FOR METAL HAS GROWN AND WE DON'T SEE OURSELVES OUT GROWING OR GETTING TIRED OF IT WE LOVE STANDARD DEATH METAL TECH PROG AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN AND DON'T LIMIT OURSELVES METAL IS JUST WHERE THE HEART IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE
AS A WRITER OF METAL MUSIC HETP I FIND THAT I MORE REGULARLY WRITE FOR FEELING I PERSONALLY WANT TO DRAW OUT THE SOMBER AND MELANCHOLY

I'VE FOUND MYSELF AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER WRITING WITH GROUPS OF LISTENERS IN MIND

CHUG PATTERNS TO SATISFY THE HEAD BANGERS

MELODIES LEADS COUNTERPOINT FOR THE SHREDDY KIDS

OFF-TIME METRIC MODULATION AND POLY RHYTHMS FOR THE PROG MATH KIDS

AND THEN I FIND MYSELF AT A CROSSROADS WHEREIN DEPENDING ON THE AUDIENCE I FIND MYSELF IN FRONT OF I ASK MYSELF DO I PERFORM THE LESS INTRICATE BITS FOR A BETTER STAGE PERFORMANCE OR THE SWEET ASS LEADS SWEEPS AND SHREDS FOR THE TECHNICAL ADMIRERS

AT SHOWS AS A FAN I FIND MYSELF WANTING BOTH SEPARATELY

I WANT MOMENTS OF BODY BANGING HEAVINESS THAT FACILITATES MY ABSOLUTE ANIMALITY BUT I ALSO WANT TO SIT BACK AND GROOVE AND ADMIRE THE CRAFTSMANSHIP OF THEIR COMPOSITION

I GUESS IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE BAND I'M ENDORSING

OCEANO LIKE A FULL MOON TO A LUPUS DEI I JUST WANT TO REEK HAVOC

THE CONTORTIONIST I AM A CROP OF WHEAT SWAYING WITH THE EBB AND FLOW

SHAMELESS AFTER NUMEROUS SELF PROMOTIONS I THINK THAT PATIENCE AND PRIORITIES INFLUENCE WHETHER MUSIC IS A TOOL FOR PEOPLE TO PRY OUT THEIR FEELINGS AND OR IT SERVES THE SAME PURPOSE AS A PIECE OF ART TO BE LOVED AND SHARED FOR IT'S MORE ADMIRABLE QUALITIES
YOU GUYS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND ME
FOR ME METAL HAS SUCH AN INSANE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT I WON'T FIND IN ANY OTHER GENRE AND I JUST NEED THAT IN MY MUSIC OF COURSE MOST BANDS ALSO HAVE MORE MELLOW SONGS AND I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TOO BECAUSE THEY SERVE AS A GREAT CONTRAST YOU CAN'T BE ON FULL POWER ALL THE TIME BUT IT ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE INTERESTING AND FRESH TO KEEP ME ENTERTAINED

AS FOR THE FEELINGS VS THE MUSIC ITSELF QUESTION I DEFINITELY LISTEN TO METAL FOR BOTH AND THAT'S PART OF THE BEAUTY OF METAL FOR ME
IT DEPENDS ON THE SUBGENRE BUT I LISTEN FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

WHEN I WAS YOUNGER IT WAS THE ENERGY ANGST AND I LIKED SKATING PLAYING ALONG ON GUITAR AND FEELING LIKE I WAS A ROCK STAR I RARELY EVEN NOTICED LYRICAL CONTENTION

NOW IT'S ALMOST PURELY FOR HOW IT MAKES ME FEEL SOME STYLES AAAL NATHRAKH OR SIDTH FOR EXAMPLE CALM ME

OTHERS SUCH AS KATATONIA SWALLOW THE SUN OR DEFTNESS ARE PURELY FOR LISTENING TO AND ENJOYING BOTH LYRICALLY AND MUSICALLY USUALLY I PLAY THESE KINDS OF GROUPS IN THE CAR

FINALLY MORE EXTREME MUSIC SUCH AS BURTRUM OR CANNIBAL CORPSE I USE TO HELP ME CONCENTRATE AT WORK I'VE ALSO BEEN LISTENING TO DEAFHEAVEN FOR SIMILAR REASONS OF LATE SOMETHING ABOUT THE AMBIENCE OF THESE BANDS REALLY GETS ME IN THE ZONE

WHEN I FEEL MORE LIKE PARTYING GETTING PUMPED UP OR DRUNK I LISTEN TO BANDS LIKE ALESTORM FLINTROLL OR KORPIKLAANI
I'M SIMILAR TO SOME OTHERS IN THAT METAL WAS NEVER CATHARTIC FOR ME OR A WAY TO GET RID OF ANGER OR AGGRESSION IT HAS ALWAYS JUST CLICKED WITH ME AND BEEN THE GENRE OF MUSIC I ENJOY MORE THAN ANY OTHERS

AND ACTUALLY WHEN LOOKING AT AGGRESSION RESEARCH PUTTING ON MY PSYCHOLOGIST HAT FOR A SEC THE CATHARSIS THEORY OF AGGRESSION HAS BEEN ROUNDLY DISPROVEN THAT IS ENGAGING IN AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR TO PURGE AGGRESSION FROM YOUR SYSTEM DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKES PEOPLE FEEL MORE AGGRESSIVE AND BEHAVE MORE AGGRESSIVELY I DON'T KNOW IF THE SAME RELATIONSHIP IS PRESENT WITH AGGRESSIVE MUSIC I DOUBT IT BUT THE CATHARSIS THEORY DOESN'T REALLY MAKE MUCH SENSE
I INITIALLY GOT INTO METAL SIMPLY BECAUSE I LIKE THE SOUND AND THE ANGER ASPECT HAS NEVER BEEN A FACTOR FOR ME LATELY METAL HAS EVOLVED INTO A DEEPLY PROFOUND AND PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE FOR ME I'M ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO GETS CHILLS GOOSEBUMPS WHEN THEY LISTEN TO MUSIC AND IT HAS BECOME MY PRIMARY IDENTIFIER IF A SONG HAS REALLY CONSCIOUSLY OR SUB CONSCIOUSLY RESONATED WITH ME NO OTHER GENRE OF MUSIC DOES THIS ME AND THESE CHILLS GOOSEBUMPS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY INTENSE BOUTS OF ENERGY AND JOY THIS IS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT WHEN I LISTEN TO DOOM METAL MELODIC BLACK METAL FOLK METAL MID TEMPO THRASH HEAVY POWER METAL INSOMNIOUS STYLE MELODEATH ETC
IT WAS THE INFLUENCE OF MY BEST FRIENDS MOTHER AND HER MENTAL FRIENDS THAT GOT ME INTO ROCK AND METAL WE'D HANG OUT WHILE THE ADULTS SPUN THEIR MAIDEN AND ANGLETWITCH LP'S TAKING IN THE ATMOSPHERE TO A REBELLIOUS YEAR OLD WHO CONSTANTLY SKIPPED SCHOOL THIS WAS A EUREKA MOMENT IT NEVER WAS THE SCENE OR THE HEAD BANGING IT WAS THE CAMARADERIE AND FRIENDSHIPS WE HAD AND DESPITE THE CROWD BEING SLIGHTLY UNHINGED THEY WERE ALL VERY NICE PEOPLE TO A FAULT I GOT GIVEN MY FIRST DEMAIN JACKET WITH PATCHES AND BADGES BY THEM EVEN GOT A FEW SINGLES TOO MY PARENTS NATURALLY DISAPPROVED WHICH MADE ME EVEN MORE CURIOUS AND PIG HEADED HERE I AM YEARS LATER AND I HAVE NOT SEEN THEM FOR SUCH A LONG TIME TIME FLIES TOO FAST ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN
I LISTEN TO IT FOR MOTIVATION LIKE WHEN YOU'RE INVOLUNTARILY CLENCHING YOUR TEETH
WELL I DUNNO

I GOT IN TOUCH WITH METAL BECAUSE OF MY BROTHER HE WAS INTO METALLICA IRON MAIDEN SODOM AND SO ON AND OF COURSE I WAS INTO IT AS I WAS COPYING MY BROTHER AND SO ON

WHEN I WAS A TEEN MY BROTHER STILL LISTENED TO SOME METAL ALBUMS BUT MOSTLY HE WAS INTO ELECTRONIC MUSIC WHICH I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT AT THAT AGE SO I BEGAN TO DIVE DEEPER INTO METAL AND DISCOVERED THE BEAUTY OF DEATH BLACK AND METAL

I ALSO HAD A PHASE WHERE I WAS ONE OF THOSE METAL OR DIE M FUCKERS BUT THANKFULLY THAT STOPPED WHEN I GOT OLDER JESUS FUCK LUCKILY THAT CHANGED SOME OF MY FRIENDS OF THAT TIME ARE STILL ROLLING LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT ONLY EMBARRASSING IT'S FUCKING STUPID

TO ADDRESS YOUR COMMENT ABOUT RELIEVING ANGER FRUSTRATION EEG IS IT REALLY LIKE THAT I MEAN AFTER A STRESSFUL DAY I ALSO LIKE CRANKING UP THE VOLUME AND LISTEN TO SOME BAD ASS BRUTAL DEATH RIFFS AS IT IS RELIEVING MY STRESS FRUSTRATION ANGER IN SOME WAY BUT EVERY STYLE OF MUSIC CAN ACHIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE INTO IT RIGHT
I MEAN COMMENTS LIKE THAT ALWAYS GOT A SPECIAL TASTE AS IT COULD IMPLY THAT ONLY PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMS FIND THEIR WAY INTO METAL

SO I COMPLETELY GET YOUR POINT AND I GET PISSED IF I HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BOOHOO MY DADDY IS AN ASS THAT'S WHY I LISTEN TO GENRE CORE

I LOVE METAL BECAUSE OF THE MUSIC MY TEENAGER YEARS AND ALL THE THINGS ME AND MY FRIENDS DID SOUNDS SUPER LAME BUT METAL WAS AND IS THE FOUNDATION OF SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDSHIPS

BUT NOW THAT I'M OLDER I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT I ALSO FOUND TASTE IN DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC
INTERESTING TOPIC MY GROUP OF FRIENDS WHEN THEY WERE INTO METAL LISTENED MOSTLY TO TRADITIONAL METAL IRON MAIDEN JUDAS PRIEST MEGADEATH ETC SOME OF IT IS STILL AGGRESSIVE AND A GOOD OUTLET FOR ANGER BUT NOT THE SAME AS THAT KIND OF DEATH OR BLACK THAT HAS ANGRY SCREAMING VOCALS WE DID HOWEVER START OUT ON NU METAL WHICH HAD TONS OF ANGST SCREAMS AND IT WAS A GOOD OUTLET

I KNOW PERSONALLY I HAVE SORT OF STOPPED LISTENING TO METAL FOR THAT COMPONENT METAL THAT IS ANGRY IS NO LONGER A DRAW AND CAN BE A DETRACTOR ESPECIALLY WHEN THE VOCALIST SOUNDS SCREAM OR CORE I CAN'T STAND IT I STILL LIKE EMOTION IN MY METAL AND SOME ANGER IS GOOD I LIKE HAPPY MELANCHOLIC EXCITING ETC METAL BUT I DO FIND THE SONGWRITING MOST IMPORTANT IT'S NOT A NECESSITY BUT LEAD GUITAR IS IMPORTANT GOOD LYRICS ARE A HUGE BONUS IDEALLY I GET TECHNICALITY WITH EMOTION I FIND I LISTEN LESS TO CHAOTIC ANGRY SOUNDING STUFF SUCH AS SOME THRASH LESS
TO ME METAL IS THE BEST GENRE OF MUSIC OUT THERE I FIND MORE ENJOYMENT LISTENING TO IT THAN I DO ANY OTHER GENRE MAYBE NEXT TO CLASSICAL THE CATHARSIS OR ANGER VENTING IS WHAT GOT ME INTO IT BUT I STAYED EVEN AFTER THAT TEENAGE ANGST WAS GONE I'M FINDING MORE AND MORE KICKLESS BANDS EVERYDAY AND IN TRUTH I THINK I'M JUST STARTING TO FIND THE METAL MUSIC I LIKE THE MOST

THE CATHARSIS IS STILL A BIG PART OF IT I FEEL LIKE SOME DAYS I REALLY JUST NEED TO TAKE A SEAT BURN ONE DOWN AND BLAST SOMETHING INTO MY EARDRUMS IT'S THERAPEUTIC IT MAKES SENSE

SO I GUESS I'M A BIT OF BOTH A LISTENER WHO REALLY ENJOYS THE MUSIC FOR WHAT IT IS WHILE ALSO USING IT TO RECONCILE SOME OF MY DARKER FEELINGS AND ANGER
I THINK MAINLY PASSIVE MUSIC LISTENERS SAY STUFF LIKE THAT PEOPLE WHO JUST LISTEN TO MUSIC IN THE CAR DON'T REALLY DIVE DEEP INTO IT LIKE SOMEONE SUBBED TO A R GENRE SUB WOULD
BUT WHEN I'M ANGRY I WANT MUSIC THAT WILL RELEASE ALL THE BRAIN CHEMICALS AND MUSIC THAT RELEASES THAT IS MUSIC I LIKE I READ A STUDY OR SOMETHING SAYING THAT WHATEVER MUSIC A PERSON REALLY ENJOYS IS THE ONE THAT RELEASES OXYTOCIN AND DOPAMINE AND ALL THAT STUFF
SURE WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I THOUGHT I WAS COOL AND DIFFERENT BECAUSE I LISTENED TO A NICHE MUSIC GENRE

BUT NOW IF IT SOUNDS GOOD I WILL GIVE IT A TRY
I JUST REALLY LOVE METAL I LOVE THE WAY IT CAN SPEAK TO WHATEVER FRUSTRATIONS I HAVE BUILT UP AND I LOVE THE WAY IT ENSHRINES MY MIND AND TAKES ME SOMEWHERE ELSE ENTIRELY I LOVE IT LOUD DEAFENINGLY LOUD AND PUMPING THROUGH MY VEINS I LOVE OLD METAL CLASSICS AND PIONEERS I LOVE SOFTER AND MELODIC METAL I LOVE PISSED OFF METAL I LOVE PROGRESSIVE METAL I LOVE FRANTIC THRASH NOISE METAL I LOVE ATMOSPHERIC DOOM AND OR BLACK METAL I FUCKING LOVE METAL

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT MOOD I'M IN I CAN LISTEN TO METAL I LISTEN TO A LOT OF STUFF OLD CHIPCHOP FOLK AMERICANA BLUES INDIE CLASSICAL ETC ETC BUT NO MATTER WHAT STATE OF MIND METAL ALWAYS ALWAYS HITS THAT SPOT

I GUESS YOU COULD COMPARE IT TO THE WAY FOLKS LOVE HORROR THEY CAN WATCH THAT SHIT AT ANY TIME OF DAY NIGHT WEEKEND OR WEEKDAY OR WHATEVER IT TOUCHES THAT NERVE FOR THEM I DON'T MIND HORROR BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS MY CUP OF TEA LIKE IT IS FOR THAT CROWD MUCH LIKE MY METAL MUSIC IS NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY ARE JAMMING OUT TO

I'M A BIT OF AN EXTREMIST ADMITTEDLY SO MAYBE THAT TIES INTO MY LOVE AND ADMIRATION FOR MY FAVORITE MUSIC I HOPE THIS IS UNDERSTOOD BEING THE THREAD WE'RE ON I'M SURE YOU ALL FEEL THE SAME TO SOME DEGREE
FATE OF NORNS BY AMON MARTH IS ABOUT A FATHER COMING TO TERMS WITH LOSING HIS YOUNG SON THE EMOTION THAT COMES THROUGH BOTH THE LYRICS AND THE MUSIC IS ANYTHING BUT A PUNCHING BAG

PEOPLE'S MUSIC TASTES GET SET AROUND THE AGE OF ALONG WITH FASHION POLITICS AND A BUNCH OF OTHER DEFINING FACTORS THESE ARE THEN PRETTY SET FOR LIFE I'LL PROVIDE A SOURCE IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED

AS A RESULT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE GET INTO METAL AT THAT AGE AND ARE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT ANGRY CONFUSED TEENAGERS SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE STEREOTYPE EXISTS HAPPY KIDS DON'T TEND TO LISTEN TO POP METAL BANDS THAT ARE SO OFTEN THE GATEWAY ONTO THE GENRE SHOW ME A KID WHO'S FIRST METAL ALBUM WAS GRINDCORE AND I'LL SHOW YOU A LIAR

SO WITH ALL THAT IN MIND THE TO STEREOTYPE EXISTS FOR A REASON BUT BEYOND THE GATEWAY BANDS THINGS GET A LOT MORE COMPLICATED

IT'S THE SAME WITH ALL GENRES CHANCES ARE YOU GET INTO MODERN R B BECAUSE YOU WANT TO FEEL COOL SEXY AND POPULAR THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT TO THE TOPICS DISCUSSED BY THE GENRE HELL JUST LOOK AT FRANK OCEAN'S LATEST ALBUM
I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT GOT ME INTO METAL WAS THE MUSICIANSHIP THE TECHNICAL PLAYING REALLY INTERESTED ME AND MADE ME WANT TO BE A BETTER GUITARIST I DO ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE THAT A BIG PART OF ME LIKING THE MUSIC IS THE EXCITEMENT THAT IT GIVES ME IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ANGRY OR DELIGHTED BUT I JUST GET ENERGIZED

SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY FOR ME IT'S BOTH THE FEELING AND THE MUSIC
I DON'T KNOW IF MY OPINION EXACTLY COUNTS BUT I GOT INTO METAL BECAUSE I GOT TIRED OF POP MUSIC SINCE IT WAS SO UNTALENTED AND EVERYTHING WAS HIGHLY AUTOTUNED ALSO TO MENTION THIS WAS WHEN POP WAS STARTING TO GO INTO TRAP RAP MUSIC SO LIKE MID YES I AM KIND OF NEW STILL TO METAL BUT I HAVE LISTEN TO A LOT OF ROCK METAL SONGS I HAVE AT LEAST SONGS IN MY ROCK METAL PLAYLIST AND I USUALLY DON'T LIKE TRAP RAP BECAUSE THE BEAT IS USUALLY VERY REPETITIVE AND OBNOXIOUS AND PLUS THE WAYS RAPPERS RAP CAN GET PRETTY ANNOYING AS WELL BY ADDING WEIRD ACCENTS TO WORDS AND JUST ADDING WEIRD NOISES IN GENERAL ALSO TO MENTION THE SUBJECTS GENERALLY THEY WOULD RAP ABOUT WAS OBNOXIOUS AND REPETITIVE TOO SINCE MOST OF AGAIN GENERALLY IS ABOUT CLUBS DRINKING PROSTITUTES ETC

SO ANYWAYS I GOT INTO METAL BECAUSE IT IMPRESSED ME THE WAY HOW THE MUSIC WAS SO UNIQUE WITH THE USUAL SOLOS AND DIFFICULT RUNS AND MUSIC IN GENERAL AND ABOUT EACH SONG I'VE LISTENED TO THEY ARE ALL USUALLY UNIQUE SOME SONGS I'VE LISTENED TO AS WELL DOESN'T ALWAYS TALK ABOUT ANGER OR RAGE SOME I'VE LISTENED TO TALKS ABOUT HAVING HOPE OR JUST HAVING FUN AND SOME EVEN TALKED ABOUT LIFE IN A GREAT PRESPECTIVE

SO THAT IS JUST MY TWO CENTS
I LISTEN TO BOTH KNOWN ARTISTS OLD ARTISTS AND UNKNOWN ARTIST AMONG THE METAL ROCK COMMUNITY BTW
STARTED LISTENING TO IT FOR THE MUSIC GOT INTO THE SCENE WENT TO FESTIVALS LIKED IT WILL KEEP DOING IT NOTHING MORE TO IT
LISTENING TO METAL ALLEVIATES BAD THOUGHTS FOR ME HEARING A SWEET GUITAR RIFF OR A CRAZY DRUM ROLL OR A MARTY FRIEDMAN SOLO OR SOMETHING GIVES ME SOME ADRENALINE WHICH MAKES THE FEELS POSITIVE
I LIKE METAL FOR IT'S ENERGY BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO CENTER AROUND ANGER TO BE POWERFUL AND ENERGETIC I TEND TOWARD CLASSIC METAL BECAUSE THE ENERGY COMES THROUGH ACROSS THE ENTIRE BAND NOT JUST A COUPLE INSTRUMENTS AT A TIME
AT FIRST IT WAS FOR THE FEELING OF ANGER HATE AND GENERAL TEENAGE ANGST FOR MYSELF I'M GETTING OLDER AND I STILL LOVE METAL I CAN SAY THAT MUSIC ITSELF WHEN WRITTEN CORRECTLY ANYWAY IS PURE UNBRIDLED EMOTION

I STILL LISTEN TO METAL BECAUSE I LOVE THE TALENT THAT IT TAKES TO DO IT KEEPING UP WITH SOME BANDS THAT PLAY SO WELL AND SO FAST WHILE COMPOSING FULL SYMPHONIES TO GO ALONG WITH THEIR MUSIC IS JUST BEAUTIFUL TO ME WHILE MOST BANDS OF MAINSTREAM MUSIC WRITE SONGS THAT ARE SOMETIMES BARELY MINUTES LONG METAL SONGS FROM MY EXPERIENCE USUALLY ARE DOUBLE THAT OR LONGER ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THEY STILL HAVE JUST MUSICALS WITH NO LYRICS BUT THEY ARE INSPIRED TO WRITE THE MUSIC THAT THEY CANNOT FIND THE WORDS TO
METAL FOR ME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANGER OR FRUSTRATION

I LISTEN FOR COMPLEXITIES IN MELODY AND INSTRUMENTAL PROWESS THAT YOU USUALLY CAN'T FIND IN OTHER GENRES SURE THE AGGRESSION SOMETIMES GIVES ME CHILLS AS THE PASSION YOU CAN HEAR IN THE VOCALS OR THE THUNDERING DRUM BEATS OR THE LAYERED GUITARS BUT AT THIS POINT IN MY MUSIC LISTENING CAREER NOTHING SATES LIKE SOME GOOD METAL
HERE'S MY STORY

I GREW UP IN A MILITARY HOUSE MY DAD WAS REALLY INTO HIS MARCHING BAND TYPE OF MUSIC MY MOM ON THE OTHER HAND IS REALLY INTO MOZART AND ANDR DIEU SO THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH ALL I LISTENED TO GROWING UP

WHEN I WAS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL MY MUSIC TEACHER INTRODUCED ME TO ALOT OF THE REALLY HEAVY CLASSICAL MUSICIANS ABRAHAMS TCHAIKOVSKY GREIG ETC I INSTANTLY FEEL IN LOVE WITH THEM REALLY IRRITATED MY MOM EVEN THOUGH IT IS STILL CLASSICAL MUSIC

THEN IN HIGH SCHOOL A FRIEND OF MINE PLAYED ME THE WEIRD MUSIC THAT HIS BROTHER LISTENS TO TURNED OUT TO BE RAMSTEIN AND NINE INCH NAILS I WAS INSTANTLY HOOKED THIS WAS HEAVIER THAN MOST OF THE CLASSICAL MUSIC I HAD ACCESS TO AND WAS MELODIC AND CATCHY TO BOOT

FROM THERE MY INTEREST JUST GREW NOW YEARS LATER I'M FIRMLY INTO PROG METAL

SO WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH POST

WELL I GREW UP IN A VERY STABLE LOVING HOME I WAS NEVER AN AGRO TEEN BUT I WAS STILL IS A BIG NERD I ALSO GREW UP LIVING MUSIC MORE FOR THE VIRTUOSITY THAN THE FEELING STILL METAL CALMS ME

SO FOR ME IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH AND I THINK THE VOCAL MINORITY ARE MAINLY AGRO KIDS I CAN'T SEE MYSELF OUTGROWING METAL JUST LIKE I WON'T BE OUTGROWING CLASSICAL MUSIC IT IS JUST TO BIG A PART OF MY LIFE
THERE'S ALMOST ENTIRE GENRE'S OF METAL ITSELF ABOUT THINGS SUCH AS TRANSCENDENCE AND BUDDHIST CONCEPTS

DO YOU HAVE ANY EXAMPLES I READ THIS PART OF YOUR POST AND IT REALLY PEAKED MY INTEREST
DEPENDS FOR ME SOME BANDS I LISTEN TO BECAUSE I LIKE THE MUSIC SOME FOR THE LYRICAL CONTENT AND CONCEPTS THEN THERE'S BANDS I LIKE FOR BOTH SUCH AS AMON MARTH ENSIFERUM BOLT THROWER AND INCHES OF BLOOD
I STARTED TO GET INTO METAL BECAUSE I JUST LIKED HEAVY MUSIC NOT SURE WHY I WAS JUST DRAWN TO IT NOW ITS BECAUSE I DEMAND MUSIC THAT PUSHES THE ENVELOPE METAL IS ARGUABLY ONE THE OF TOUGHEST GENRES TO PLAY ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET INTO MORE TECHNICAL I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE AGGRESSION ASPECT MAYBE I DID WHEN I WAS YOUNGER CERTAINLY I ENJOY A REALLY HEAVY BREAKDOWN OR RIFF BUT ITS NOT FOR THE AGGRESSION I JUST LIKE HOW IT SOUNDS I GUESS FOR ME ITS JUST ABOUT LISTENING TO THE TECHNICALITY OF THE PLAYERS THE OTHER GENRES I LISTEN TO LIKE JAZZ AND PROG ROCK ALL FOCUS ON THAT MOST OTHER HOBBIES I HAVE I TEND TO REALLY GET INTO THEM I THINK I JUST AM A PERSON WHO HAS DEMANDING TASTES AND EXPECTATIONS WHETHER IT BE BEER SCOTCH FOOD PHOTOGRAPHY OR MUSIC I JUST TEND TO TRY TO GET INTO THE MOST EXTREME ASPECTS OF THOSE HOBBIES TO ME METAL IS ARGUABLY THE MOST EXTREME FORM OF MUSIC AS FAR AS TECHNICALITY AND HOW ALIENATING IT IS TO THE AVERAGE PERSON SO THAT'S WHAT IT IS FOR ME
THE MUSIC IN ITSELF EVOKES FEELING AND AUDIAN INTENSITY WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO A SPECIFIC SONG SOMETIMES THE FEELING OCCURS THROUGH PROGRESSIONAL BUILDUP IN THE ALBUM OR AN INSTANT HIT WHILST LISTENING TO IT I EXPERIENCE ALL SORTS EVERYTIME WHICH KEEPS ME HOOKED ON METAL
EXPERIENCING MUSIC AS A PUNCHING BAG IS A FORM OF AURAL EXPERIENCE I THINK OF MUSIC AS PROVIDING INTELLECTUAL CEREBRAL EMOTIONAL AND OR PHYSICAL STIMULATION IT EITHER MAKES YOU THINK FEEL OR WANT TO MOVE YOUR BODY SOME BANDS AND GENRES EMPHASIZE ONE OF THESE OVER THE OTHERS FOR ME METAL PROVIDES A GOOD BALANCE OF ALL THREE WITH INDIVIDUAL BANDS AND PROVIDING THESE STIMULATIONS IN VARYING DEGREES SOMETIMES I'M LOOKING FOR A CEREBRAL EXPERIENCE SOMETIMES I WANT MY SOUL MOVED AND SOMETIMES I JUST WANT TO HEADBAND AND SMASH MY AIR GUITAR METAL IS BROAD ENOUGH THAT I CAN ALWAYS FIND A BAND THAT SUITS THE KIND OF STIMULATION I'M LOOKING FOR AT THE MOMENT

ALTHOUGH I FIND METAL ENERGIZING AND EMOTIONAL AT TIMES I WOULDN'T SAY I'VE PERSONALLY FOUND IT ESPECIALLY CATHARTIC I WAS A CISSY TEENAGER CONSTANTLY GETTING IN FIGHTS BUT I DIDN'T CONNECT THAT WITH MY INTEREST IN METAL I WOULDN'T SAY METAL HELPED ME WITH MY ANGER NOR DID IT MAKE THINGS WORSE BY VIRTUE OF GROWING OLDER I DID EVENTUALLY CALM DOWN BUT I STILL LIKE METAL MAYBE THE FACT THAT I DIDN'T USE METAL FOR CATHARSIS IS THE REASON I NEVER OUTGREW METAL MAYBE LOTS OF MAYBES HERE FORMER METALHEADS USED METAL AS A THERAPIST AND NOW NO LONGER NEED THAT THERAPY METAL WAS NEVER MY THERAPIST SO THERE WAS NO REASON FOR ME TO MOVE AWAY FROM METAL
I LISTEN TO METAL SIMPLY BECAUSE I LOVE LISTENING TO METAL SURE I CAN APPRECIATE THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE MUSIC OR THE MESSAGE THE ARTIST IS TRYING TO GET ACROSS AND SO FORTH BUT MOST OF ALL I JUST LOVE METAL MORE THAN ANY OTHER MUSIC GENRE IT'S REALLY THE CRUNCHY RIFFS THE MUDDY PRODUCTION AND THE PUMMELLING DRUMS THAT RESONATES WITH SOMETHING WITHIN ME I KNOW IT SOUNDS PRETENTIOUS BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS I CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE PEOPLE COME FROM WHEN THEY SAY THEY WANT TO GET THE ANGER AND FRUSTRATION OUT WHILST LISTENING TO METAL BUT I THINK METAL IS SO MUCH MORE THE SPECTRUM OF HUMAN EMOTIONS THAT CAN BE EXPRESSED THROUGH METAL IS HUGE
I THINK IT INITIALLY FILLED MY NEED TO EXPRESS AGGRESSION BUT THEN I GREW UP AND MY APPRECIATION GREW DEEPER
I GOT INTO METAL FOR BOTH REASONS REALLY I'M A HUGE OUTDOOR NUT I'M ALWAYS HIKING CAMPING JUST IN GENERAL BEING OUTDOORS I LOVE NATURE BECAUSE OF HOW IT CAN BE BEAUTIFUL AND RELAXING AND AT THE SAME TIME BE ABSOLUTELY FUCKING TERRIFYING I LOVE MUSIC FOR THE EXACT SAME REASONS BUT METAL HELPS COMPLETE THE SPECTRUM FOR ME AT IT'S TAMEST ITS FUN OR HAUNTING AT ITS MOST EXTREME ITS WILD UNRELENTING UNEXPLAINABLE AND SOMETHING THAT CAN AND WILL KNOCK YOU THE FUCK DOWN

SO FOR ME I LISTEN TO METAL IN THE SAME FASHION I'LL SIT OUTSIDE AND WATCH A PARTICULARLY NASTY STORM CRAWL ITS WAY TO MY RESIDENCE IT'S A BIT OF ADRENALINE WITH A STRANGELY COMFORTING FEELING OF SOMETHING THAT MAY SEEM DANGEROUS COMING YOUR WAY AND THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE ABOUT IT

ALL THAT NONSENSE AND MY BELIEF THAT ALL MUSIC NEEDS TO BE APPRECIATED IN SOME WAY BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A PURE AND UNBRIDLED LOOK INTO THE COLLECTIVE HUMAN PSYCHE
EVERY SCENE HAS IT'S SERIOUS FANS AND IT'S POSERS AND I DON'T MEAN POSERS IN THE SUPER NEGATIVE MANPOWER KILLS KIND OF WAY BUT THAT THEY WERE INTO IT BECAUSE IT WAS POPULAR AT THE TIME AND EVERYONE WANTED TO FIT IN THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT AND IT'S VERY COMMON BEHAVIOR

WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE IN THE MID S IT WAS ALL ABOUT RAP MUSIC AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF MY FRIENDS FROM THOSE DAYS GREW OUT OF IT BECAUSE THEY WERE NEVER THAT INTO IT THEY JUST WANTED TO FIT IN SOME WERE SERIOUS FANS AND ARE STILL HIP HOP HEADS TO THIS DAY

IT'S THE SAME SHIT WITH METAL MUSIC

THE BIG DIFFERENCE I SEE WITH METAL AS OPPOSED TO SAY RAP OR COUNTRY IS THAT METAL HASN'T BEEN MAINSTREAM FOR DECADES THE ENTIRETY OF THE S POPULAR MUSIC IS DOMINATED BY RAP COUNTRY AND ELECTRONIC SO YOU RUN INTO THESE PEOPLE WHO MAYBE LISTENED TO METALLICA BACK IN THE DAY BUT THE MOMENT YOU PUT ON ANYTHING DEEPER THAN SURFACE LEVEL AND YOU GET COMMENTS ABOUT SCREAM HOW CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING OR I GREW OUT OF IT

I DON'T LISTEN TO METAL BECAUSE I'M ANGRY I JUST LOVE IT GETTING ROWDY IN THE CROWD AFTER 2 JOINTS AND BEERS IS WHERE I WANT TO BE AND IF I CAN'T BE THERE I'M CONTENT BEING THAT GUY IN MY OFFICE WHO HEADBANDS AT HIS DESK ALL DAY

TL R

JUST PEOPLE BEING PEOPLE

WAY MORE FOR THE MUSIC I LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC A LOT AND ONE OF THE FEW GENRES IN CURRENT MUSIC THAT HAS A COMPARABLE DEGREE OF COMPLEXITY AND STRUCTURE IS METAL NOT ALL OF IT OBVIOUSLY BUT I LIKE LISTENING TO VERY SKILLED ARTIST PLAYING MUSIC

AGAIN THIS IS A SIMPLE OPINION BUT I ACTUALLY THINK IN TERMS OF VENTING ANGER AND FRUSTRATION RAP SERVES AS A BETTER MEDIUM MOST METAL IS TOO MELODIC TO FOCUS ON A SPECIFIC FEELING
I DO FEEL LIKE I'VE OUTGROWN THE NEED FOR METAL TO BE AN OUTLET FOR ANGER BUT I ALSO REALLY LIKE THE MUSIC AND NOW I LISTEN TO A LOT MORE COMPLICATED OR ATMOSPHERIC STUFF
HONESTLY IT HA SO LUCKY BEEN RECENTLY THAT I LEARNED THAT PEOPLE LISTEN TO IT TO RELIEVE ANGER I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE SHEER TECHNICALITY AND SKILL THE GENRE REQUIRES
I ORIGINALLY GOT INTO METAL AS AN ANGST TEEN AND ALTHOUGH MY SPECIFIC TASTE HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME I STILL FIND METAL MOST INTERESTING OTHER FORMS OF MUSIC JUST BORE THE SHIT OUT OF ME SOME GUY SINGING OVER THE SAME CHORDS AND SAME DRUM BEAT IS JUST DUMB AS SHIT THE THING IS THAT SORT OF REPETITIVE DRIBBLE HAPPENS IN METAL BUT BESIDES GOING INTO CLASSICAL MUSIC I FIND TECHNICAL FORMS OF METAL TO BE THE ONLY THING THAT INTEREST ME SO MANY OF THE GREATEST NEW METAL ALBUMS ARE NOT ABOUT RAGE OR DEATH OR NEGATIVITY AT ALL BUT INSTEAD USE THE HEAVY MEDIUM OF METAL MUSIC TO TELL CAPTIVATING AND ORIGINAL STORIES

YOU COULD LOOK ANY A BAND LIKE RIVERS OF NIHIL AND HEAR THE AGGRESSION AND INSTANTLY THING THAT THE SONG IS ABOUT ANGER OR SOMETHING RELATED BUT ALOT OF THERE MUSIC IS ABOUT THE CONCEPTS OF MAN'S IMPACT ON NATURE OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE AND MANY OTHER DEEPLY THOUGHT PROVOKING IDEAS

OTHER CASES ARE BANDS LIKE DISSONANCE IN DESIGN WHO WROTE AN ALBUM WHICH TELLS THE STORY OF THE DOWNFALL OF MANKIND THROUGH ITS OWN GREED AND SELF PURSUIT BUT HAS A INTERESTING MESSAGE ABOUT THE PURIFICATION OF MAN RATHER THAN THE IDEA OF MAN'S RUINATION LIKE MANY PEOPLE MIGHT INTERPRET IT AS

TOO MANY PEOPLE HEAR ONE DISTORTED CHORD OR ONE DISTORTED VOCAL PART AND INSTANTLY THINK IT'S JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER ANGRY METAL SONG THAT EVER EXISTED BUT THE TRUTH IS METAL IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND FREE MEDIUMS OF ARTISTIC EXPRESSION THAT EXIST IN MODERN SOCIETY
I LISTEN TO METAL ABOUT OF THE TIME AND THE OTHER IS SPLIT BETWEEN CLASSICAL JAZZ AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER STUFF THAT IS MUSICALLY INTERESTING TO ME I LOVE TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT BLUEGRASS FOR EXAMPLE WHICH MIGHT SEEM ANTITHETICAL TO MY LOVE OF METAL TO ME THEY AREN'T

PERSONALLY I ENJOY TECHNICAL OR MUSICALLY COMPLEX METAL I'VE FOUND MOST METAL HEADS AND AUDIENCES TO BE PRETTY INTELLIGENT AND MUSICALLY EDUCATED MIGHT BE INFLUENCED BY WORKING AT UNIVERSITIES AND BEING A FORMER MUSICIAN MYSELF I HAVE AN UNUSUALLY BIASED SAMPLE APPARENTLY

I'VE NEVER ENJOYED THE PURE AGGRESSION KIND OF METAL OR THAT APPEALS PRIMARILY TO ANGST RAGE ANGER AND HATE OTHER PEOPLE CAN LISTEN TO WHATEVER MAKES THEM HAPPY BUT I PREFER MUSIC WITH DEPTH AND WEIGHT AND IT NEEDS TO BE INTERESTING

SO FOR ME I'M DEFINITELY IN THE METAL AS MUSIC CATEGORY AND HAVE BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN I REALLY GOT INTO THRASH AS A KID IT WAS PARTIALLY BECAUSE IT WAS MOSTLY MORE MUSICALLY INTERESTING THAN MOST PUNK AND POPULAR I STILL LOVED BOWIE AND THE TALKING HEADS AND IGGY POP AND LATER THE PIXIES AND SONIC YOUTH STILL DO AND I'VE NEVER FELT THAT LISTENING TO METAL WAS AN CHARACTERISTIC THAT MEANT SOME MUSIC WAS OFF LIMITS I LISTEN TO ALL KINDS OF METAL AND OTHER MUSIC AND DON'T REALLY GIVE A FUCK IF SOMEONE ELSE THINKS PROG ISN'T REAL METAL DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU I'LL DO WHAT WORKS FOR ME THERE ARE NO GATEKEEPERS OR ARBITERS OF MUSICAL TASTE

TL R METAL IS MUSIC AND I ENJOY IT AS MUSIC BAD METAL IS JUST BAD MUSIC GOOD MUSIC TRANSCENDS GENRE
I LIKE METAL FOR THE SOUNDS OF THE MUSIC I LIKE MOST KINDS OF METAL OR CORE I CAN FALL ASLEEP LISTENING TO IRON MAIDEN OR THY ART IS MURDER DOESN'T BOTHER ME BECAUSE I LIKE THE MUSIC IT'S A GREAT WAY OF PASSING TIME IT'S THE BACKGROUND NOISE TO PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IN LIFE

IF I'M ANGRY I PREFER NOT TO LISTEN TO MUSIC SO I DON'T TIE IT TO BAD EXPERIENCE
FOR ME PERSONALLY EVERYONE I KNOW WHO IS INTO METAL IS A HUGE NERD INCLUDING MYSELF WE LOVE THAT IT ISN'T ALL POP OR AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL THEMED AND HAS MANY ELEMENTS OF FANTASY I GOT INTO IT BECAUSE IT JUST SPEAKS TO ME IN A WAY THAT MOST MUSIC DOESN'T NOT AS AN OUTLET FOR AGGRESSION I WANT MUSIC TO DELIVER ON ITS FULL POTENTIAL AND NOT HOLD BACK REALLY TRY FUCKING HARD TO MOVE ME AND METAL DOES THAT IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON THE SUB GENRE

ANECDOTE IN HIGH SCHOOL I LOVED DIRE STRAITS THE BEATLES AND TOOL BUT NONE OF THAT WAS REALLY PERFECT TO ME IN A MEDIA CLASS SOMEBODY BLASTED THE OPENING BARS OF BLIND GUARDIAN INTO THE STORM AND I WAS HOOKED IN FIVE SECONDS FINALLY SOMETHING THAT ROCKED IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE AND WAS ABOUT SOMETHING I CARED ABOUT

TOOK A WHILE TO GET INTO THRASH AND DEATH BUT HONESTLY IT IS JUST LIKE ACQUIRING A TASTE FOR BEER OR WINE NOT BECAUSE OF MY DEEP INNER DARKNESS

METAL ACTUALLY TAUGHT ME TO REALLY APPRECIATE TWO OTHER UNLIKELY GENRES SWING AND OPERA FOR THEIR TIME THEY ARE ALSO ALL ABOUT KICKING ASS AND TAKING NAMES AND HOLDING NOTHING BACK
WITH ME IT'S KIND OF BOTH
THERE ARE BANDS GENRES I'LL LISTEN TO WHEN I'M TRYING TO BLOW OFF STEAM BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE BANDS GENRES I LISTEN TO ON THE REGULAR BECAUSE THEY CHEER ME UP ETC BUT I ENJOY METAL FOR ITSELF AS WELL SO WHILE THAT HELPS FOR AN EMOTIONAL CONNECTION IT'S ALSO SOMETHING I THOROUGHLY ENJOY LISTENING TO FOR THE MUSIC ITSELF
I'M MY MUM WAS RIGHT IT'S JUST A PHASE I AM GOING THROUGH LIKELY TO END WHEN I KICK THE BUCKET I GOT INTO METAL THROUGH THE HAIR METAL BANDS IN THE AND STAYED NO ANGST ANGER OR HATRED FOR ME
I'M NOT GONNA SAY I HATE OR THAT I DESPISE WHEN PEOPLE SAY METAL IS THERAPEUTIC DELEAVES STRESS ETC BUT I JUST DO NOT FEEL THE SAME WAY I BELIEVE ART IS ART PURE BY ITSELF AND NEEDN'T AND SHOULDN'T BE JUSTIFIED BY ANY MEANS IF YOU LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE OF THE TECHNICAL SOLOS THE STRESS YOU RELIEVE OR THE VOCALS IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU LISTEN TO IT ALLTHESAME MAKING YOU AND YOUR OPINION AS VALID AS ANY OTHER
HOWEVER I PERSONALLY APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE OF IT'S ESSENCE REBELLIOUS INDEPENDENT ARTICLE IN A WORLD WHERE BANDS SEEM TO AIM FOR THE MAINSTREAM INCOME AND FAME I PERSONALLY TEND TO IDENTIFY MORE WITH THE TARVE KELT METAL SINCE IN MY OPINION IT IS WHERE THE TRUE NATURE OF ART IS HIDDEN IN CONTEMPORARY MUSIC
I STUDY ART STILL A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AND TRY TO DRAW A PARALLEL BETWEEN METAL MUSIC AND OTHER ART STYLES PAINTINGS SCULPTURES ARCHITECTURES ETC ART'S GOAL IS NOT TO PLEASE PEOPLE TO BELEAVE STRESS OR TO BE A MACHO MANUAL ART'S GOAL IS TO BE NOT TO DO
OF COURSE THAT'S MY OPINION
IT IS A MIX FOR ME I ORIGINALLY BEGAN GETTING INTO MORE EXTREME METAL WHEN I WAS AROUND FOURTEEN OF COURSE AT THAT AGE IT WAS DUE TO BEING EDGY AND ANGST I'LL JUST SAY GOD HATES US ALL WAS MY FAVORITE ALBUM YEAH IT WAS BAD AT THIS POINT I'M NOW I STILL LOVE THE MUSIC BUT I LISTEN TO A WIDE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT GENRES IF I PUT MY MUSIC ON SHUFFLE IT COULD GO FROM CATTLE DECAPITATION TO SIMON AND GARFUNKEL TO BLACK SABBATH THE MAIN REASON I LISTEN TO THE MUSIC NOW IS BOTH AS A MEANS TO LET ENERGY OUT AND FOR THE LYRICS DEPENDING ON WHO I'M LISTENING TO IF I'M AT THE GYM I'LL HAVE CANNIBAL CORPSE SLAYER AMON MARTH HAVOC ETC PLAYING ON MY WAY TO WORK EARLY IN THE MORNING OR GOING TO SCHOOL I'LL LISTEN TO CATTLE DECAPITATION TO WAKE ME UP AND GIVE ME ENERGY AND NEUTRAL MILK HOTEL ON MY WAY HOME TO CHILL OUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY I CAN'T JUST LEAN BACK AND CHILL OUT TO SOME DYING FETUS I DO IT ALL THE TIME BUT I MAINLY LISTEN TO METAL NOW TO GIVE MYSELF ENERGY THOUGH THERE ARE A FEW BANDS OUT THERE THAT HAVE SOME REALLY DECENT LYRICS THAT CAN TOUCH ON SOME DEEP CONCEPTS THAT I ENJOY NO SORRY CANNIBAL CORPSE DOESN'T MAKE THIS LIST FOR EXAMPLE I PUT ON UNNATURAL SELECTION THE WEEK LEADING UP THE THE ELECTION IF I'M RELAXING WHILE READING I MIGHT PUT ON LEVIATHAN OR BURTRUM IF I WANT SOMETHING MORE EMOTIONAL MAYBE DREAM THEATER IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE BAND I PREFER BANDS THAT HAVE MORE MEANINGFUL LYRICS BE IT POLITICS PHILOSOPHY RELIGION HISTORY ETC BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP ME FROM PUTTING ON TRAMPLE THE WEAK HURDLE THE DEAD WHEN THE MOOD STRIKES ME OVERALL THE MUSIC ITSELF IS WHAT THE ATTRACTION IS THE COMPLETE YOU CAN GET IN METAL IS INCREDIBLE IRON MAIDEN NECROPHAGIST MEGADEATH JAPETH SUNN O TRISTANIA LEVIATHAN AND TYR ARE EIGHT DIFFERENT BANDS EIGHT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SOUNDS ALL UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF METAL I GET DIFFERENT FEELINGS AND DIFFERENT BENEFITS FROM EACH ARTIST SO MY REASONS FOR LISTENING TO THEM ARE DIFFERENT
ABOUT HALF OF THE METALHEADS I KNOW DO NOT LOOK LIKE METALHEADS ONE LOOKS LIKE A STEROID EATING DISCO RAT ANOTHER IS ALSO INTO RAP AND DRESSES MORE LIKE ONE THE THIRD ATTENDED AN AMON MARTH CONCERT AFTER HIS WORK WITH HIS SUIT STILL ON NOT TO MENTION THE IT GUY

ME I USUALLY LISTEN TO MUSIC WHATEVER I DO OF THAT BEING SOME SORT OF METAL ALSO I SLEEP LIKE A BABY TO MOONSORROW

NO ANGER INVOLVED LITTLE TO NO TRASH METAL I LIKE AND NO I'M NOT A BLOODY POSER WHO OVERDRESSES BECAUSE IT'S METAL
WHEN I'M PISSED I LISTEN TO BARONESS YELLOW GREEN AND OR PURPLE WHICH DON'T EVEN COUNT AS METAL DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ASK I'VE NEVER REALLY BEEN A DEPRESSED OR SAD PERSON ALWAYS A FULL KINDA GUY

BEATS ME WHY I LISTEN TO SHIT LIKE PIG DESTROYER
PERSONALLY I JUST LISTEN TO IT FOR THE MUSIC THE SCENE DOESN'T INTEREST ME TOO MUCH BUT LISTENING DOES HELP ME RELAX SOMETIMES ONE EXTRA PLUS IS I'M A TEENAGER AND WHEN ARGUING WITH MY PARENTS I CAN JUST BLAST SOME DARK THRONE FOR PAYBACK
I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO METAL FOR ABOUT YEARS NOW NOT ONCE HAVE I COSHED OR USED IT TO VENT ANGER

I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE OF IT WHEN IT DRAWS ME INTO ANOTHER PLACE I USED TO LISTEN TO A LOT OF POWER METAL AND EPIC MUSIC FOR THIS EFFECT I THINK I WAS ALSO DRAWN TO THE IDEA THAT I ACTUALLY WAS LISTENING TO MUSIC I FOUND NOT WHAT WAS PUT IN MY FACE

I LATER STARTING CRAVING MORE EXTREME GENRES OF METAL AGAIN NOT FOR ANGER VENTING DEPRESSION ETC MY FAVOURITE GENRE IS DEATH DOOM METAL AND I FIND IT UPLIFTING

I THINK A GOOD INDICATOR THAT YOU LISTEN TO METAL FOR THE MUSIC IS WHEN YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT LYRICS I HAVEN'T CARED FOR THOSE IN MANY YEARS I OFTEN JUST NEED A THEME FOR THE SONG AND MAKE MY OWN ATMOSPHERE UP
AH WELL I GUESS NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO RETELL MY STORY

I GREW UP AROUND RAP HIP HOP POP R B COUNTRY MY LIFE WAS SO SATURATED BY IT IN FACT THE MAJORITY OF THE MUSIC I HAD LISTENED TO CAME FROM MY TWO OLDER SISTERS WE WERE ALL FOSTER CHILDREN MYSELF MY ELDEST BROTHER MY OLDEST SISTER AND MY OLDER SISTER

WE WERE MOVED FROM HOME TO HOME TO HOME TO HOME SO I WAS INTRODUCED TO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF MUSIC AT A YOUNG AGE

THEN IN WHEN I WAS BUT A WEE YEAR OLD I WAS MOVED ALONG WITH MY SIBLINGS TO A FAMILY HOME WHICH WAS NEWSPEAK FOR ORPHANAGE WE WERE ALLOWED TV ONCE A DAY AND FOR AN HOUR THIS WAS DURING THE ERA WHEN HIP HOP AND RAP WERE GETTING POPULAR ON MTV AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ORPHANAGE WANTED TO LISTEN WATCH

IT WAS MAY I REMEMBER MTV TOUTING IT WAS NEWEST VIDEO

UNTIL IT SLEEPS

I HAD NEVER HEARD METAL BEFORE THAT SAVE THE ARGUMENT FOLKS LET ALONE SEEN A VIDEO LIKE THAT IT BLEW MY GODDAMN MIND I WAS SWIMMING IN A SEA OF EMOTIONS I HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE AND BY GOD IT WAS GLORIOUS I NEEDED TO HEAR IT AGAIN EVERY DAY I WATCHED MTV THEY PLAYED THE CRAP OUT OF IT

THEN THE STATE FOUND US A HOME AND LIKE THAT MTV VANISHED METALLICA VANISHED

MY BROTHER IS YEARS OLDER THAN ME AT THE TIME HE HAD A TAPE DECK STEREO BOOMBOX THAT HE CARRIED WITH HIM EVERYWHERE HE HAPPENED TO HAVE THE LOAD TAPE AND I BEGGED HIM TO LET ME BORROW IT ONE DAY THE WORDS NO HELL NO AND KEEP DREAMING STILL RING IN MY HEAD

I EVENTUALLY BORROWED HIS COPY OF LOAD JUST SO I COULD LISTEN TO THAT SONG

FAST FORWARD TO THIS DAY AND DEATH THRASH GROOVE METAL ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT REALLY GIVE ME THAT FEELING ANYMORE
I GOT INTO METAL BECAUSE IT ALLOWED ME TO RELEASE ANGER AND DEPRESSION THAT I HAD IN A HEALTHY WAY I'M NO LONGER THAT WAY SO I'M MOSTLY IN IT FOR THE MUSIC THAT DOESN'T MEAN I NEVER GET MAD HOWEVER SO IT STILL HELPS FOR THAT
AS MOSTLY A FAN OF THE ATMOBLACK PAGAN NORFOLK RITUAL AMBIENT STONER AND EMERGENTLY SO SPACE ROCK AND DUNGEON SYNTH GENRES IT'S DEFINITELY ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE MORE THAN ANY LEVEL OF ANGST SEEKING OF TECHNICALITY OR EXTREME HEAVINESS OR EVEN ANY IDENTIFICATION WITH LYRICS I PAY THEM NO MIND GIVE ME A GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF THE AESTHETIC WITH SOME ALBUM ART AND SONG TITLES AND SET ME ADRIFT WITH SONGS YOU CAN GET LOST IN I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE GENERAL THEME OF WHAT I GET OUT OF METAL AND ALL MUSIC REALLY ESCAPISM HYPNOTIC TRANCELIKE SOUNDSCAPE ARE A CERTAIN QUALITY THAT CAN REALLY TRANSCEND THE MUSICAL STYLE BE IT HEAVY FOLKY ELECTRONIC OR WHAT HAVE YOU NILE FOR EXAMPLE ARE GENERALLY A STRAIGHTFORWARD HEAVY DOSE BUT THEY HAVE SOME GREAT SONGS LIKE WROUGHT THAT REALLY PULL YOU IN OR A MORE RECENT EXAMPLE OF VEATOR YEAH THEY'RE THRASH BUT DEFINITELY POSSESS MORE TO THEIR SOUND OF THIS SOMEWHAT INTANGIBLE ELEMENT WHICH IS WHY I THINK THEY'RE SO POPULAR ANYMORE BECAUSE THAT HAVE THAT QUALITY BUT ALSO THE SPEED AND RIFFAGE DRAWING IN TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAN TO THE MUSIC
I LISTEN TO METAL FOR THE MUSIC I'M AN EXTREMELY HAPPY PERSON ALL THE TIME I'VE NEVER USED METAL AS AN OUTLET FOR ANGER SADNESS AFTER A BREAKUP DEFINITELY BUT NEVER STRAIGHT ANGER

I ENJOY THE LEVEL OF SKILL IT TAKES TO PLAY THE GENRE AND THE TOPICS DISCUSSED TOO LYRICAL CONTENT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME I REALLY DON'T SEE MYSELF EVER OUTGROWING IT AND I FEEL LIKE I'LL BE LISTENING TO THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE STARTED WHEN I WAS AND I'M NOW STILL GOING STRONG AND I STILL GO TO CONCERTS AND I STILL GET EXTREMELY EXCITED WHEN I FIND A NEW BAND THAT I LIKE
WHY NOT BOTH
TO SORT OF SUMMARIZE MY OWN FEELINGS AS WELL AS THE MASS OF COMMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY HERE THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID FOR BOTH ASPECTS OF METAL THAT YOU DESCRIBE ONCE IN A WHILE IF I'M IN A DARK PLACE I LIKE TO CRANK SOMETHING REALLY AGGRESSIVE CLOSE MY EYES AND USE IT AS A MENTAL PUNCHING BAG

DAY TO DAY THOUGH I STILL PREFER METAL TO EVERY OTHER GENRE BECAUSE IT APPEALS TO ME MUSICALLY THERE IS SO MUCH DIVERSITY WITHIN THE GENRE THAT I CAN ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING TO MATCH MY MOOD I TEND TO GRAVITATE TOWARD MORE MELODIC POWER METAL GROUPS LIKE BLIND GUARDIAN AND EPIC BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS SO DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE EVEN JUST WITHIN A SINGLE SONG IT'S ALSO VERY COMPLEX AND TECHNICAL FROM A MUSICAL PERSPECTIVE SO I CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY ROCK OUT AND GEEK OUT

THERE'S ALSO A SIDE TO METAL THAT THE UNINITIATED RARELY SEE THE MUSICALLY BEAUTIFUL SIDE A GREAT MANY GROUPS REALLY MAKE AN EFFORT TO CREATE A COMPLEX EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE IN THEIR MUSIC AND NOT JUST THE MORE MELODIC DEATH METAL CAN BE FUCKING TRANSCENDENTAL I THINK IT'S PART OF WHY CLASSICAL MUSIC AND METAL GO SO WELL TOGETHER THERE'S A VERY SIMILAR BLEND OF RAW POWER AND FINELY CRAFTED BEAUTY I ENJOY THE WORKS OF CLASSICAL ARTISTS LIKE GRIEG AND BEETHOVEN BUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOST EMOTIONALLY MOVING PIECES OF MUSIC I'VE EVER HEARD WERE WRITTEN BY METAL ARTISTS
I LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE WHEN I LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE I GET BORED AS FUCK AND KEEP THINKING I COULD BE LISTENING TO METAL RIGHT NOW
WHEN I FIRST GOT INTO METAL IT WAS AS AN ANGST TEENAGER AND I ONLY REALLY LISTENED TO SUPER HARDCORE SHIT LOL BUT THEN WHEN I STARTED PLAYING GUITAR I STARTED LISTENING TO OLDER METAL AND NOW I LISTEN TO IT FOR THE MUSIC
I LISTEN FOR THE MUSIC I LOVE THE VARIETY IN METAL I GO TO METAL SHOWS FOR THE FEELING I'VE NEVER FOUND A BETTER FEELING THAN THE ENERGY OF A CROWD AT A GOOD METAL SHOW
I ORIGINALLY GOT INTO METAL IN HIGH SCHOOL OR AT LEAST WHAT I CONSIDERED TO BE METAL I WAS AN EMO SCENE KID IN HIGH SCHOOL AND LISTENED TO THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA AND BRING ME THE HORIZON EVENTUALLY I GREW OUT OF THAT STAGE BUT I CONTINUED TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THE GENRE OF COURSE WHAT I LISTENED TO WAS PRETTY MUCH METALCORE EVENTUALLY I GOT INTO DEATH THRASH DOOM BLACK PROG STONER ETC

AT FIRST I GOT INTO METAL TO FIT IN BUT AS I GOT OLDER I STARTED TO APPRECIATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF IT NOWADAYS I LISTEN PRIMARILY TO PROG AND STONER DOOM METAL JUST BECAUSE IT HELPS ME RELAX AND UNWIND DON'T GET ME WRONG I LOVE ME SOME TECHNICAL DEATH AND GRINDCORE BUT ONLY WHEN THE MOOD REALLY STRIKES ME
FOR ME IT'S BOTH BUT IF I WAS GOING TO SIDE WITH ONE OR THE OTHER I THINK I WOULD PUT THE MAJORITY OF THE EMPHASIS ON THE FEELING AT LEAST FOR SOME SUBGENRE OF METAL

BLACK METAL FOR EXAMPLE IS ALMOST ENTIRELY ABOUT THE STYLIZED EXPRESSION NEOCLASSICAL ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD BE ALMOST ENTIRELY ABOUT THE COMPOSITION

SO IT DOES DEPEND FROM GENRE TO GENRE WHAT I FIND IMPORTANT BUT OVER ALL I GRAVITATE TO DIFFERENT GENRES DEPENDING ON WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN FOR THAT MOMENT
I ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE I HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE SAME THING THAT YOU DESCRIBE WITH METALLICA WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I LOVED METAL BECAUSE IT EXPRESSED HOW I FEEL ED AND IT LET ME BLEW OFF SOME STEAM
BUT NOW I JUST LOVE THE MUSIC BUT I MOSTLY LISTEN TO BLACKMETAL POSTBLACK AND CLASSICS NOW ESPECIALLY BLACK METAL OVERWHELMS ME OFTEN TIMES WITH THE ESTHETICS OF THE SOUND IT'S REALLY HARD TO EXPRESS THAT IN ENGLISH FOR ME
I SEE HUGE SWATHES OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY ONLY GOT INTO METAL BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AND THE MUSIC RELIEVES THAT IN A SENSE AND NOW THEY'VE IT

NEVER HAPPENED FOR ME BUT OVERALL FROM MY FAVOURITE BANDS THERE'S VERY FEW ANGER RAGE TYPES AND MORE THE MORE MUSICALLY COMPLEX AND ABSTRACT SIDE OF METAL OR VARIANTS WHICH WHILE FAST AND HEADBANGABLE ARE FAR MORE VARIED IN ACTUAL LYRICS AND THEMES

DO YOU THINK IT'S GENERALLY THE CASE THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY ONLY INTO METAL FOR THE SCENE ASPECT OR JUST THE OR IS THAT JUST THE VOCAL MINORITY

VOCAL MINORITY THERE'S A LOT OF TEENAGERS THERE BUT I'D SAY IT'S RARE TO FIND MANY PEOPLE LIKE THAT PAST EARLY I HAVE KNOWN A COUPLE SO THEY DO EXIST BUT ARE OVERALL RARE SUCH FANS TEND TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS EITHER FALSE METAL AND STUFF THAT GETS MISLABELLED AS METAL CORE SCREAM ETC BUT WILL UNFORTUNATELY PROBABLY FOREVER BE ASSOCIATED OR THRASH WHICH I DON'T MIND IT'S POSSIBLY MY LEAST FAVOURITE MAINSTREAM METAL GENRE BUT THERE ARE SOME GOOD BANDS TO BE FOUND
VARIES FROM BAND TO BAND AS A DRUMMER I AM ALWAYS LISTENING FOR TASTY FILLS SEE THE FIRST 2 DISSECTION RECORDS FOR THE BEST EVER BUT OTHER THAN THAT I DONT REALLY THINK ABOUT WHY I LIKE CERTAIN MUSIC EXCEPT FOR SAMHAIN THEY ARE MY FAVORITE BAND AND I LIKE THAT MUSIC FOR BOTH REASONS
LET ME JUST OFFER THIS I'M THE METALHEAD AMONG MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHEN THEY COME OVER THE METAL STAYS ON I'VE FOUND THAT WITHOUT EXCEPTION THEIR LITTLE KIDS ALWAYS LOVE THE METAL ALWAYS NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF MUSIC THEY'RE USED TO I'VE HAD INFANTS WHO CAN'T WALK OR SPEAK CRAWL OVER TO MY SPEAKERS AND POINT AT THEM UNTIL I PUT IN METAL I'VE HAD 2 YEAR OLDS COSHING IN MY LIVING ROOM WITHOUT BEING SHOWN OR TOLD WHAT COSHING IS I'VE HAD A YEAR OLD TELL ME I LIKE THE MUSIC THAT GOES RAAAAAAAHHHH

MY POINT IS NONE OF THESE KIDS IS INTO METAL TO FIT INTO A SCENE OR TREND NONE OF THEM HAVE REBELLION OR ANGER ISSUES YET THEY ARE COMPLETELY PURE AND HONEST AND THEY LOVE METAL

CLEARLY IT'S THE ENERGY THEY LOVE ABOUT IT AND THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT GENRES
DOES ANYONE KNOW ANYMORE ABOUT THE NEW ALBUM THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE PUTTING OUT
I KEEP COMING BACK TO THEIR SOPHOMORE ALBUM IT'S SO HYPNOTIC
SUCH A GREAT BAND MAYBE SOMEDAY THEY'LL DO A US TOUR

THERE ARE SOME BANDS THAT HAVE AWESOME NAMES BUT THE MUSIC DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE NAME WITCH VOMIT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE BANDS
FUCKING HELL WHAT A BAND NAME GOOD SONG TOO I CAN DIG IT KINDA HAS A CRUST OR OLD SCHOOL GRIND VIBE GOING I GET ON KICKS WHERE THAT'S ALL I'LL LISTEN TO BUT YEAH WOW THAT FUCKING BAND NAME
I THOUGHT THEY STOLE MY UNDERNAME FOR A SECOND REGARDLESS THIS IS GREAT
YEP STILL HAVEN'T HEARD A GOOD METAL COVER OF THAT SONG I THINK IT'S FOR AT THIS POINT
SO DAMN AWESOME AND UNIQUE THE CLEANS COME OUT OF NOWHERE BUT THEY FIT THE THEME AND FEEL OF THE SONG SO WELL

METAL

ENUCLEATOR DEMO USA BLACK DEATH METAL

FILTHY BLACK DEATH IN THE VEIN OF REVENGE THOUGH IT FEELS MORE FIRMLY PLANTED IN BLACK METAL WAR BESTIAL METAL FANS MIGHT WANT TO CORRECT ME HERE AS I M NO EXPERT IT S A SHAME THE BAND SEEM TO HAVE SPLIT BECAUSE THIS IS A GLORIOUS MESS OF FILTH AND DECAY JUST LISTEN TO THIS AND THIS I KNOW RIGHT WHAT AN ANGRY BUNCH OF YOUNG MEN WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE NOT GIVING A RAT'S ARSE THIS IS WHAT I PUT ON

GRAVE MIASMA ENDLESS PILGRIMAGE DORI SEPULCRORUM UK OCCULT CAVERNOUS DEATH METAL

I VE BEEN LISTENING TO ENDLESS PILGRIMAGE ON AND OFF THIS YEAR WHEN IT CAME OUT THERE WAS LOTS OF OTHER MUSIC ON MY MIND SO IT DIDN T GET A PROPER CHANCE TO SINK IN A SHAME BECAUSE ENDLESS PILGRIMAGE IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF HOW DEATH METAL CAN BE TWISTED AND TURNED IN TO JUST ABOUT WHATEVER YOU FANCY A BIT LIKE AKERCOCKE GRAVE MIASMA IMBUE THEIR CAVERNOUS ASSAULT WITH OCCULT THEMES AND A STATELY RITUALISTIC FEEL THE FORMER DO SO WELL THERE S A DISTINCTLY BRITISH SENSE OF DRAMA TO THE MADNESS BIT OF GOATS BLOOD WITH YOUR TEA LIKE

AS FOR THE PHYSICAL RELEASES FOR THESE TWO ALBUMS THEY ARE GORGEOUS THE ARTWORK FOR ENDLESS PILGRIMAGE SHINES WHEN LAID FLAT AND THE LP LAYOUT IS EXCELLENT THERE S A POSTER TOO THOUGH I TEND NOT TO DISPLAY THEM DORI SEPULCRORUM LOOKS NO LESS SPECTACULAR ALTHOUGH THE ARTWORK ISN T AS NOTABLE


AUROCH AMAN CHUD CANADA DEATH METAL

AGAIN THERE S AN OCCULT FEEL TO AUROCH BUT INSTEAD OF THE STATELY APPROACH OF GRAVE MIASMA THEY SEE FIT TO BATTER YOU INTO ACCEPTING OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR SATAN THEY PLAY A DIZZYING CYCLONIC STYLE OF DEATH METAL NOT THAT DISSIMILAR FROM MID-PERIOD GORGETS THERE S A BIT MORE OOMPH BEHIND THEM THOUGH AND LESS OUTRIGHT EXPERIMENTALISM TAKE THE FIRST TRACK OFF THIS ALBUM FOR EXAMPLE IT S SPIDERY AND VERTIGO INDUCING YET LEAN AND TO THE POINT THE REST OF THE ALBUM FOLLOWS THIS SAME PATTERN SOMETIMES TO A FAULT IT S GOOD THAT IT S SO SHORT ANY MORE AND IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH

STELLAR ALBUM OI MAGGI IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES THIS IS A DAMN GOOD ADDITION TO THE CATALOG
FOAH THIS IS SWEET GONNA CHECK THIS OUT WHEN IT'S WITHIN BUDGET
JUST GIVING THIS ALBUM A FIRST LISTEN LIKING WHAT I HEAR SO FAR WILL HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK OUT THE OTHERS
GREAT ALBUM EASILY AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO SHAME THE MASTERING IS CRUSHED TO HELL BUT IT'S TO BE EXPECTED
EXHUMER IS NONETHELESS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF EURO THRASH HISTORY

PHOTOS IMAGES ORIGINAL
HOBBS IS FINALLY ON PONTIFY FOUND ONE OF THESE GUYS ALBUMS YEARS AGO BUT NEVER COULD FIND ANYTHING ELSE FROM THEM THERE WELL WORTH A LISTEN IF YOUR INTO DISTINCT VOCALS
WEIRD NAME WAS SKEPTICAL BUT THIS IS SOME GOOD SHIT
INTERESTING QUESTION IT TAKES ME ONLY MINUTES TO READ A REVIEW BUT UP TO MINUTES TO LISTEN TO ONE SONG OR FOR AN ALBUM THAT MAY HAVE A FEW STINKERS HIDING THE GEMS I THINK IT STILL HAS A PLACE ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH UNDERGROUND STUFF THAT YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO LISTEN TO ALL OF IT
AND CAN BE INCREDIBLY ENTERTAINING TO READ

ISN'T THAT YOUR ANSWER RIGHT THERE CRITICS CAN GIVE A PERSPECTIVE ON MUSIC THAT CAN HELP READERS APPRECIATE MUSIC MORE IT DEFINITELY HAS A PLACE IN MY OPINION
APART FROM THE ROLE OF CRITIC AS TASTEMAKER OR CURATOR OR ADVISER OR SCOUT EACH OF WHICH MIGHT BE THREATENED BY LISTENERS ABILITY TO SIMPLY HEAR THE MUSIC FOR THEMSELVES DIRECTLY OVER THE INTERNET A GOOD CRITIC CAN DIRECT A ATTENTION AND THAT'S IRREPLACEABLE WHEN A CRITIC SAYS X Y AND Z ARE THE INTERESTING PARTS OF THIS ARTWORK FOR REASONS P Q AND R THAT'S THE OUTPUT OF AN EDUCATED AESTHETIC SENSE SUCH CLAIMS ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE TO NEOPHYTES WHO DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN APPRECIATING AN ARTWORK BUT THEY'RE ALSO INTERESTING AND VALUABLE TO A SEASONED AUDIENCE WHO CAN THEN ENGAGE WITH THE CRITIC'S JUDGMENTS
THIS IS A VALID QUESTION TO OTHER CULTURAL REALMS AS WELL JESSA CRISPIN A BOOK CRITIC TOUCHES THE SUBJECT ON THIS ESSAY WHERE SHE STATES AND I FIND IT VERY TRUE

I AM TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT DRAGGED ME INTO THIS ROLE TO BEGIN WITH BOOKS HAD SERVED ME I WANTED TO SERVE THEM BACK IT MUST HAVE BEEN AS SIMPLE AS THAT
YES TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE CRITICISM OBSOLETE COMPUTERS CAN COMPARE PLAYLIST AND TELL THAT TWO PERSON SHARE THE SAME TASTES FROM THIS ONE CAN BUILD A PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF THE CRITICS THEN PERHAPS TAGGING BECAUSE THOSE SYSTEMS WORK BETTER IF THINGS ARE CORRECTLY TAGGED
AS THE CURRENT TOP CHART AS MY EVIDENCE NUMBER MUSIC CRITICISM IS NOT OBSOLETE
KIM FAVORITE BAND
FUCKING FIGURES EVERYONE LOSING THEIR MINDS OVER THE ETERNAL CHAMPION ALBUM DECIDED TO SIT THIS ONE OUT

GRAVEN RITE WERE THE BETTER BAND OF THE TWO UNTIL THE NEW EC ALBUM YA DINGUSES
SUCH A GOOD DEMO
THREE DOLLARS ON BANDCAMP THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH WAY MORE THAN THAT SO GOOD
GREAT SONG WHILE NOT ENTIRELY SAME GENRE REMINDS ME OF OLD-WORLD AND AUSTERE
WTF WAS THAT
BEST ALBUM IMHO

TOO BAD THERE'S NO VINYL VERSION OF BANQUET JUST ANATOMY AND INSTINCT
GREAT BAND THE TITLE TRACK TO THIS ALBUM IS A FAVORITE OF MINE

IF TOMATO SAUCE RUINS THE SEASONING OF YOUR CAST IRON THEN YOUR SEASONING WAS WEAK AS FUCK AND IS A THING TO BE MOCKED MOCKED COOK SOME FUCKING SHAKSHUKA IN YOUR GLORIOUS IRON WORKHORSE YOU FUCKING FUCK

AND HONESTLY IF YOU'RE THAT WORRIED JUST COOK SOME BACON IN IT AFTERWARDS IDIOT
I SWEAR THE UK IS INTENT ON TURNING ITSELF INTO A ORWELLIAN SUPERSTATE THE GOVERNMENT HAS JUST PASSED WHAT'S COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE SNOOPERS CHARTER

THE LAW WILL REQUIRE INTERNET AND PHONE COMPANIES TO STORE COMPREHENSIVE RECORDS OF WEBSITES VISITED AND PHONE NUMBERS CALLED FOR MONTHS AND TO ENABLE POLICE SECURITY SERVICES AND MULTIPLE OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR BODIES TO ACCESS THOSE RECORDS ON DEMAND

IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE SECURITY SERVICES WITH THE LEGAL POWER TO BULK COLLECT PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS DATA AND GIVE POLICE AND SECURITY SERVICES THE EXPLICIT POWER TO HACK INTO AND BUG COMPUTERS AND SMARTPHONES THESE POWERS WILL LARGELY REQUIRE ONLY THE APPROVAL OF THE HOME SECRETARY

WHAT'S UPSETTING IS THAT PRACTICALLY NO-ONE BLINKED AN EYE IN THE WAKE OF BREVIT EVERYONE'S MIND IS OBVIOUSLY ELSEWHERE BUT IT'S A TRAVESTY THAT THE MEDIA BARELY REPORTED THIS BLOODY FUCKING HELL BRITAIN GET YOUR MIND OUT THE GUTTER AND SET YOURSELF STRAIGHT
IS ANYONE PICKING UP THE NEW POKEMON TOMORROW IF SO FUCK YOU IT DOESN'T COME OUT OVER HERE FOR ANOTHER WEEK FUCK SAKE NINTENDO
ANYONE ELSE SUFFER FROM TINNITUS

HAD IT IN MY LEFT EAR FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW AFTER A STUBBORN INFECTION NOT DUE TO LOUD METAL SOME BLACK METAL AND THRASH SEEMS TO HIT THE RIGHT FREQUENCIES TO DROWN IT OUT OTHERS NOT SO MUCH POWER METAL SEEMS TO MAKE IT WORSE
SO MY TRUCK WAS TOTALLED LAST NIGHT SITTING AT A RED LIGHT AND SOME ASSHOLE LOOKING AT HIS PHONE SLAMMED INTO THE BACK OF MY TRUCK IT WAS MY ONLY VEHICLE AND MY LIVELIHOOD I WORK OUT OF THE BACK OF MY TRUCK EVERYONE WAS FINE NO INJURIES BUT NOW I'M STUCK WITH NOTHING TO DRIVE AND NO WAY TO DO WORK I WAS CONTACTED BY A LAWYER LAST NIGHT AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND HE WANTS ME TO GO TO THE ER AND GET CHECKED OUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT LIKE THIS
THE GUY WHO HIT ME HAS INSURANCE I'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE TELLING ME TO USE THE LAWYER AND OTHERS SAYING NOT TO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO I JUST WANT A TRUCK SO I CAN GO BACK TO WORK THIS SHIT SUCKS
NOTES ON WESTERN ESOTERICISM

EVEN THOUGH MY WIFE ISN'T SAYING ANYTHING I KNOW SHE IS UNNERVED BY SOME OF THE BOOKS I AM READING THAT HAVE THE WORLDS OCCULT ON THE FRONT WITH PENTAGRAMS AND ALL SEEING EYES WE WERE AT A BOOK STORE AND I BROUGHT HER A BOOK ON THE SYMBOLOGY OF THE TAROT AND SHE LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS GOING TO BRING AN EVIL SPIRIT HOME WITH US I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS STUFF FASCINATED ME WHEN MOST OF THE MAJOR RELIGIONS HAVE JUST AS FANTASTIC AND MYSTIC PROPERTIES AS SOME OF THE FRINGE BELIEFS FROM WHAT I AM UNDERSTANDING A LOT OF WHAT IS LISTED BELOW WAS FIRST DRAFTS OF MAJOR RELIGIONS OR JUST SPLINTER GROUPS FROM MAJOR BELIEFS IT IS JUST FASCINATING TO ME THAT WE CAN THINK OF ONE BELIEF SYSTEM AS TRUE OTHERS AS NOT TRUE BUT UNDERSTANDABLE AND OTHERS AS FUCKING CRAZY WHAT SEEMS TO SEPARATE THE THINGS BELOW IS THE BELIEF OF SECRET KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS THE USE OF SYMBOLS

SO HERE I AM STILL MAKING MY WAY THROUGH A RANGE OF TOPICS THAT SEEM TO FIT UNSORTED IN A DRAIN BASIN AT THE BOTTOM OF RELIGION SCIENCE PHILOSOPHY MYTHOLOGY AND STRAIGHT UP CONSPIRACY THEORY IF U RAOULDUKE OR U PADSBOLTSSAINTS HAS ANYTHING TO ADD OR CORRECT ME IN MY UNDERSTANDING WITH SOME OF THESE TOPICS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO LISTEN AND TALK WITH A CUP OF COFFEE IN SOME SHED INT HE WOODS



WHAT I THINK I KNOW AND I AM SURE I AM WRONG ABOUT MOST THINGS



THE OCCULT AN UMBRELLA TERM FOR ESOTERIC PHILOSOPHY WITH A SHARED BELIEF OF SECRET AND HIDDEN KNOWLEDGE INCLUDES THINGS RANGING FROM MAGIC ALCHEMY SPIRITUALISM MYSTICISM DIVINATION AND ANY OTHER PHILOSOPHY THAT HAS A SECRETIVE OR HIDDEN TRUTH FOR BELIEVERS

GNOSTICISM A PROTO SPLINTER CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY WHERE BY THE WORLD WAS CREATED BY A FALSE GOD AND EXISTENCE IS A HORRID SIMULACRUM OF THE TRUE WAY OF THINKING CHRIST WAS GIVEN TO THE WORLD AS SORT OF A TREASURE MAP FOR FOLLOWERS TO EVENTUALLY REALIZE THE TRUTH AND ESCAPE THE FALSE EXISTENCE

ALCHEMY A MIXTURE OF PHILOSOPHY MYSTICISM WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FRONT RUNNERS FOR TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT IN AN AGE WHERE THAT THING WASN'T REALLY SUPPORTED INVOLVED THE TRANSMUTATION OF ELEMENTS BUT ALSO INVOLVED THE TRANSMUTATION OF THE SOUL FROM LESSER STATES TO PURE STATES NOW IS USED AS A PLACEHOLDER FOR MYSTIC SCIENCES AND MAKING HEALTH POTIONS

KABBALAH JEWISH MYSTICISM

HERMETICISM I SHOULD REALLY FIGURE THIS ONE OUT SINCE THIS NAME APPEARS OVER EVERYTHING I READ

FREEMASONRY AN ANCIENT ORDER OF THINKERS BUILDERS THAT USED MYSTICISM AND INTRIGUE TO SPREAD THEIR PRESTIGE THOUGHT BUT IS NOW JUST A FRATERNITY OF PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE IDEA OF BEING APART OF A SECRET ORDER THAT PROBABLY DOES NOTHING MORE THAN EAT DINNER ONCE A MONTH

THE ILLUMINATI SEE FREEMASONRY ABOVE BUT EVEN LESS OF AN ORGANIZATION NOW MORE A MEME THAN ANYTHING SUBSTANTIAL

ROSICRUCIANISM MYSTIC CHRISTIANITY WITH SOME WEIRD LOOKING CROSS THAT WOULD PROBABLY GIVE MY FATHER A HEART ATTACK IF HE SAW I WAS READING ABOUT IT

MAGIC I HAVE SEEN IT REFERENCED AND PEOPLE BEEN REFERENCED AS MAGICIANS BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT COULD MEAN A LEADER OF AN ESOTERIC PHILOSOPHY OR PRACTITIONER OF RITUAL MAGIC

DIVINATION THE PRACTICE OF MAKING PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE USING MATERIAL OBJECTS TAROT AUGURY SCRYING ALL FIT INTO HERE I LISTENED TO A CONSPIRACY PODCAST DON'T ASK AND AN IDEA WAS RAISED ABOUT HOW COMPANIES USE BIG DATA FROM YOUR BROWSING HISTORY AS A FORM OF DIVINATION TO COMMERCIAL HABITS



BOOKS I AM READING OR HAVE READ

SEASON OF THE WITCH HOW THE OCCULT SAVED ROCK AND ROLL INTERESTING BOOK ON THE OCCULTS INFLUENCE ON CENTURY ROCK MUSIC NOT TO TERRIBLY IN DEPTH FOR ANYONE WHO KNOWS SOME OF THE MORE FAMOUS STORIES OF LED ZEPPELIN OZZY OSBOURNE MICK JAGGER AND DAVID BOWIE

OCCULT AMERICA A REALLY COOL AND ALSO FOCUSED VIEW ON MYSTICISM IN THE FOUNDATIONS OF AMERICAN HISTORY WESTERN ESOTERISIMC IS HUGE WITH THE DARK AGES RENAISSANCE ENLIGHTENMENT BUT THIS BOOKS STARTS IN THE S AND WORKS ITS WAY SLOWLY THOUGH THE CENTURIES EXAMINING THE FOUNDATIONS OF SPIRITUALISM MORMONISM THE SHAKERS AND ALL MANNER OF CHRISTIAN SECTS THAT MIXED WITH ESOTERIC PHILOSOPHY



EDIT I THINK IT IS HILARIOUS TO MENTION THAT IT WAS HEAVY METAL'S USE OF OCCULT IMAGES THAT LED ME TO INVESTIGATE THE MEANING BEHIND THEM I GUESS MY YOUTH GROUP PASTOR WAS RIGHT
I THINK I'M STARTING TO DEVELOP SOME SERIOUS ANXIETY DISORDER AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO DO OR WHERE TO LOOK I JUST FEEL ON EDGE ALL THE TIME LIKE THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE WATCHING ME OR THAT I'M ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING GRAVELY WRONG AND I CAN'T SHAKE IT AND ITS REALLY STARTING TO HAVE A VISIBLE EFFECT ON ME I JUST FEEL REALLY LOST RIGHT NOW AND I'M NOT EVEN PARTICULARLY SURE WHY I'M WRITING THIS

OH AND DISHONORED 2 IS FUN
WELL I'M HERE EARLY WHO SAW ARRIVAL I LIKED IT A LOT
I'M NEW TO THIS SO I'M ASSUMING THE DISCUSSION IS HERE RIGHT


EVER WAY I HAVE A QUESTION


IS PIRATING MUSIC EVER JUSTIFIED



A FRIEND OF MINE RECENTLY BOUGHT SOME OF THE LATEST MAGIC CARDS TO BUILD A CARD DECK SO WE CAN PLAY A FORMAT OTHER THAN EDH I'M PARTICULARLY HAPPY BECAUSE I USUALLY WIN AGAINST HIM IN CASUAL

SAME FRIEND BMED A SESSION OF FOR ME AND MY ROOMMATE WHERE WE EACH MAKE TWO LEVEL 2 CHARACTERS A GLADIATOR AND A BACKUP THE GLADIATOR CHARACTERS FIGHT TO THE DEATH AND WHOEVER WINS LEVELS UP TO THREE WHILE THE OTHER PERSON HAS TO PLAY THEIR BACKUP MY CHARACTER WAS A CLERIC RANGER MULTICASTS AND BEAT THE OTHER GLADIATOR WHO WAS A WARLOCK CLERIC MULTICASTS
I APPLIED TO BE A METAL COLUMNIST FOR A SOMEWHAT WELL KNOWN PUNK MAGAZINE WISH ME LUCK
WHO ELSE WORKS IN A CORPORATE TYPE JOB I FEEL LIKE I WILL NEVER FIT IN HERE EVEN THOUGH I TRY TO MAKE CONVERSATION WITH MY COWORKERS BOUT STUFF THEY LIKE I'M PROBABLY EVEN MORE VERSED ON OUR SPORTS THAN THEY ARE BUT I STILL FEEL A DIVIDE IT DOESN'T HELP THAT THEY ARE ALL RATHER WELL OFF AND I CAME FROM A POOR FAMILY HAVE A TON OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND MY SALARY IS NOT THAT GREAT AND THE YOUNGER PEOPLE HERE DON'T REALLY TALK TO ME EITHER BECAUSE I'M TEETOTAL AND THAT'S ALL THEY EVER ASK ME ABOUT


I JUST TRIED TO MESSAGE PANOPTICON TO ASK IF THE VINYL VERSION OF AUTUMN ETERNAL WOULD EVER BE BACK IN STOCK AND IT GAVE ME THIS HETP EMAIL ADDRESS
WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE CLASSIC ROCK BAND AND YOUR FAVOURITE ALBUM OF THEIRS
SO PICKED UP A SIDE JOB DOING DELIVERIES FOR POSTDATES CUT MY HAND PRETTY BADLY LAST MONTH AND THE BILL FOR THE STITCHES IS ABOUT INTERVIEWING FOR A PROMOTION AT WORK TODAY AND PUT OUT SOME FEELERS AT OTHER COMPANIES AS WELL

OUTSIDE OF THAT I'M PUTTING OUT A NEW RECORD TOMORROW AND A FRIEND OF MINE IS WORKING ON A VIDEO MIX TAPE WITH ME ANYONE WATCH THOSE STUFF LIKE THE CRAZY DAVE TAPES AND PSYCHEDELIC HELL TRIP WE'RE JUST COLLECTING WEIRD VIDEO CLIPS NOW BUT IT'S BEEN FUN SO FAR
I FINISHED THE METALLICA REVIEWS AP CAN YOU UNCHAIN ME NOW
NEW GHOST IN THE SHELL TRAILER DISGUSTS ME ANY COMPLAINTS OF WHITEWASHING ASIDE IT LOOKS TERRIBLE AND COMPLETELY MISSES THE POINT OF AITS I COULD TALK FOR HOURS ABOUT WHAT MAKES IT LOOK AWFUL SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT
ANY ONE INTO METAL

I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THE NEW IF THESE TREES COULD TALK ALBUM IS AN ALBUM OF THE YEAR CANDIDATE I HUGEST TO GIVE IT A TRY
ALSO THE NEW CULT OF LUNA JULIE CHRISTMAS COLLABORATION MARINER IS A GREAT CANDIDATE TOO

BUT I STILL HAVE MORE MATERIAL TO LISTEN TO FOR EXAMPLE I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO LISTEN THE NEW MOUTH OF THE ARCHITECT ALBUM AND I'VE READ GOOD STUFF ABOUT IT
I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT YEARS OF CHILD ABUSE HAS RENDERED ME COMPLETELY INCAPABLE OF DEVELOPING CLOSE EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS AND I FEEL THE ONLY WAY WOULD BE TO TAKE SUBSTANCES THAT COMPLETELY PUT ME IN A DISASSOCIATIVE STATE

UPON REALIZING THIS I'M NOW UNABLE TO HAVE THE BALLS TO TAKE DRUGS TO REACH THIS STATE AND JUST AVOID PEOPLE IN GENERAL

I'M SUPER LONELY AND WANT TO DIE
ANCOME RECOMMEND A GOOD FICTION BOOK SERIES IVE FALLEN OUT OF READING RECENTLY AS I HAVEN'T FOUND A SERIES TO GET INTO LATELY I'LL READ PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING BUT SUPERNATURAL FANTASY ELEMENTS ARE MY PROBABLY A FAVORITE FOR ME I LIKE GETTING INTO A SERIES BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE MORE FLESHED OUT

I TRIED RITALIN FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST WEEKEND IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HAD A DRUG IN MY LIFE INCLUDING ALCOHOL EXCLUDING CAFFEINE IF YOU COUNT THAT I REALLY ENJOYED THE WAY I FELT ON IT IT MADE ME FEEL MORE FOCUSED AND HONESTLY MADE ME FEEL HAPPIER THAN NORMAL I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN BECAUSE I COULD DEFINITELY SEE MYSELF BECOMING DEPENDENT ON IT BUT IT HAS MADE ME WANT TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST MORE TO GET EVALUATED FOR DEPRESSION
I WAS SITTING IN TACO BELL ON MY LUNCH BREAK BTW THE STEAKHOUSE BURRITO IS WORTH THE PRICE AND I STARTED TO THINK HOW BEAUTIFULLY FAKE TACO MEAT AND METAL GO TOGETHER IS THIS JUST ME I FEEL LIKE IT'S PROBABLY NOT
ANYONE KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH NUCLEAR WAR SITE AND FORUM
ANY OF MY FELLOW POTTERHEADS SEEING FANTASTIC BEASTS THIS WEEKEND I'M SO READY

ALSO METALLICA COMES OUT TOMORROW ASDJFASLKDJF LASHGLAGLAJD
MY PC JUST STARTED ACTING UP BY GIVING MY THE FINGER IN THE FORM OF MULTIPLE BLUE SCREENS AT THIS STAGE I'M KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED THAT IT DOESN'T CRASH IN A SIMILAR FASHION TO LESS THAN A YEAR AGO
I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS ALREADY BUT THE NED THEMED BAND HOWDILLY GOODWILLY RELEASED THEIR DEBUT ALBUM KILLY DOCILELY LAST WEEK

AS A LONG TIME SIMPSONS FAN I GAVE IT A FEW LISTENS NEXT THING I KNOW HALF THE ALBUM IS STUCK IN MY HEAD AND I'VE BOOKED TICKETS TO SEE THEM SUPPORT MAC SABBATH AND METALLACHI IN LA NEXT YEAR

I APPRECIATE THAT THE MUSIC REALLY ISN'T FOR EVERYONE BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE HATE THEY GET ONLINE I THINK IT'S SUPER CREATIVE I REALLY ENJOY THEIR TAKE ON THE THEME GENRE AND I WANT TO SUPPORT THEM MOSTLY SO THEY CAN GET EVEN BETTER NED COSTUMES

ANYONE ELSE ENJOY THIS ALBUM ALSO INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF MAC SABBATH

EDIT MY FAVORITE TRACK IS GODSPEED LITTLE DOODLE CHECK IT OUT IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THEM YET
DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE EASIER OR HARDER FOR BLACK METAL BANDS TO GET A VISA NOW THAT TRUMP WILL BE PRESIDENT
STEEL CUT OATS AND A CUP OF EARL GREY ARE MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT MORNINGS
I'VE STARTED USING AN OLD SKATEBOARD TO GET AROUND CAMPUS BUT AFTER AN AFTERNOON OF PUSHING AROUND CAMPUS MY FOOT GETS REALLY SORE LIKE PIT ALL YOUR WEIGHT ON THE OTHER FOOT I DON'T THINK I'M PUSHING WRONG BUT ANY SUGGESTIONS
SO I JUST DECIDED I'M NOT GOING TO BE LOOKING AT METALSUCKS ANYMORE I LIKED TO GO AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING INTERESTING EVERY NOW AND THEN BUT I JUST CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND A GOOD METAL NEWS SITE THAT ISN'T WRITTEN BY GIANT VAGINAS
I RECENTLY GOT INTO ANIMALS AS LEADERS AND WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY ESPECIALLY BY THE JOY OF MOTION I LOVE JAZZ AND PROG SO THOM WAS ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE COULD YOU GUYS SUGGEST ANY SIMILAR ARTISTS ALBUMS
GOOD METAL MEMOIRS I LOVED BOOK TONS OF FASCINATING STORIES AND INSIGHT INTO BLACK SABBATH I SEE MUDSTAIN HAS A MEMOIR I'M THINKING OF GETTING ANY OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS
IF I EVER GET TIRED OF JENNIFER BOOBS CHECK MY PULSE FOR VITAL SIGNS
CONGRATULATIONS TO DECIBEL MAGAZINE FOR WINNING THE FUCK DECEMBER AND HALF OF NOVEMBER PRIZE OF

EDIT ASIDE FROM MY BEING A JACKASS END OF THE YEAR LISTS SHOULD BE USED AS A TOOL TO FIND NEW MUSIC SO IF THIS HELPS PEOPLE LISTEN TO NEW ALBUMS SURE JUST GET OFF MY LAWN WHEN YOU DO


SOME GOOD PICKS SOME QUESTIONABLE OMISSIONS AND A FEW ALBUMS THAT IN MY VIEW RANKED A LOT HIGHER THAN THEY DESERVED NAILS ALBUM IS GOOD BUT IT'S NOT THAT GOOD GLAD TO SEE GORGETS RANKED WELL PLEIADES DUST IS A MASTERPIECE PHOBOCOSM SUB-ROSA ALL GOOD PICKS ON THAT LIST

A FEW ALBUMS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I THINK REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE AT LEAST RANKED THOUGH

SHRINE UNORTHETA

ULCERATE SHRINES OF PARALYSIS

WORMROOT VOICES
GLAD NO ONE IS COMPLAINING ABOUT INTER PARADISE GALLOWS BEING ON THERE THAT SHIT IS CRUSHING
I USED TO ONLY GET MY METAL INFO FROM DECIBEL SO IT'S WEIRD SEEING THEIR PICKS COMPARED TO WHAT ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED THE BEST METAL ALBUMS OF THE YEAR BY R METAL AND MYSELF NOW THAT I DON'T GET MY INFO FROM THEM AT ALL

AND DOES DECIBEL NOT KNOW WHO VEATOR IS WHAT THE FUCK
THERE WERE SOME GOOD PICKS IN THERE BUT I'M REALLY SURPRISED NONE OF THEM INCLUDED EXPERIMENT OF EXISTENCE
SWEET FIGURED I WASN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT PUBLICATIONS I DON'T READ MAKING LISTS THAT DIFFER MORE THAN FROM MY OWN BEFORE BLACK FRIDAY
GOOD LIST STRAIGHT TO THE POINT RATHER THAN HAVING TO CLICK NEXT FOR ALBUM PER WEB PAGE
IT'S NOT EVEN DECEMBER

ANYWAYS DECENT MIX OF GOOD MEDIOCRE AND FUCKING AWFUL STUFF AS I'D EXPECT FROM THEM
I'M HAPPY TO SEE BLOOD INCANTATION IN THE TOP THREE I REALLY LOVE THE STYLE OF DEATH METAL ON THAT ALBUM

NAILS I'M SCRATCHING MY HEAD AT NAILS IS GOOD BUT THAT ALBUM ISN'T THE BEST THING THEY'VE DONE NOR DO THEY DESERVE SUCH A HIGH SPOT BUT WHATEVER

STILL HAVEN'T LISTENED TO THE KHEMMIS I THINK I SOMEWHAT ENJOYED THE LAST ONE SO I GUESS I'LL CHECK IT OUT

OVERALL NOTHING IN THE TOP REALLY ALIGNS WITH ME BEYOND BLOOD INCANTATION
STOKED TO SEE TRAP CROWN FERAL ON THERE HONESTLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS THIS YEAR
HAPPY TO SEE CROWBAR ON THERE BUT THAT'S THE ONLY ALBUM I KNOW YEAH I DON'T KNOW SHIT ABOUT SHIT SHUT UP I KIND OF WANT TO MAKE IT A POINT TO LISTEN TO ALL OF THESE NOW
A MOSTLY COMPLETE PONTIFY PLAYLIST TOP OF
GLAD KHEMMIS IS UP THERE PROBABLY MY FAVORITE OF THE YEAR
NO IHSAHN
WOW I BARELY RECOGNIZE ANY OF THEM OTHER THAN THE BLACK METAL ONES I NEED TO LISTEN TO OTHER GENRES
I MEAN I LIKE NAILS BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS
I THINK SOME STUFF SHOULD BE A LOT HIGHER AND OTHERS A LOT LOWER BUT OTHERWISE IT'S A SOLID LIST CAN'T DISAGREE KHEMMIS BEING NUMBER SEEING AS IT'S MY NUMBER 2 ABBATE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS BEING IN THE TOP THOUGH
NO EMBALMER

WHERE IS THE PHONE SO I CAN CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION
GOOD TO SEE VIRUS ALBUM ON THERE WAS FUCKING SOLID
DON'T THINK WE WILL SEE AN ALLEGATION ON THIS LIST
DEFINITELY SOME ALBUMS ON THE LIST THAT WILL WIND UP ON MY TOP BUT THE ORDER IS QUITE OUT OF WHACK FOR ME FOR INSTANCE THE NAILS ALBUM WAS GOOD BUT IT WOULDN'T EVEN SCRATCH MY TOP FOR THE YEAR PROBABLY
KHEMMIS AT NUMBER IS WHACK I APPRECIATE WANTING TO PUSH SMALLER BANDS BUT SERIOUSLY

NAILS BLOOD INCANTATION AND ORANSSI ARE ALL SOLID CHOICES THOUGH AND ALL RANKED NEAR THE TOP IN MY LIST HAVING ABBATE AT IS CRAZY THAT ALBUM IS SO DULL

SURPRISED BY NO MENTION OF THE BODY I LOVED NO ONE DESERVES HAPPINESS AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE CRITICAL DARLINGS AT THE MOMENT ALSO VEATOR OBVIOUSLY
HERE'S THE ONES I KNOW

INVERLOCH ONLY GAVE THIS ONE ONE SPIN DIDN'T DO TOO MUCH FOR ME BUT MAYBE WITH MORE LISTENS IT'LL GROW ON ME

INQUISITION I LIKED THIS ONE GOOD RIFFS VOCALS TOOK A WHILE TO GET USED TO COULD HAVE USED MORE LEAD GUITAR

CULT OF LUNA JULIE CHRISTMAS REALLY OUTSIDE MY COMFORT ZONE BUT NOT BAD SOMETHING ABOUT HER ANGST SCREAMS I LIKE

I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THIS ONE A BIT TOO CHAOTIC AND CRAZY FOR MY LIKING NOT ENOUGH HOOKS OR DISCERNIBLE MELODY

TESTAMENT GOOD ALBUM GLAD ITS HERE

WRETCH ALSO GLAD TO SEE THIS HERE GOOD TRADITIONAL DOOM

MESHUGGAH I DID NOT LIKE THIS ALBUM VOCALS STOOD OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB TO ME I LIKE THE TECHNICALITY BUT I LIKE MORE HOOKS

COBALT I'VE GIVEN THIS ONE SPIN AND I REMEMBER HATING IT MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE VOCALS I'M SEEING PRAISE IN THE COMMENTS SO MAYBE I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE

GORGETS ONLY LISTENED TO THIS ONCE BUT I REMEMBER IT BEING GOOD

ABBATE I REALLY LIKED THIS ALBUM SEEMS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SHREDDING FIND IT TOO PLAIN BUT I LIKE THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH GOOD STOMPING RHYTHM AND SOLOS REMINDED ME OF MOORHEAD FOR SOME REASON

NAILS THE HEAVINESS IS SHOCKING BUT NOT SOMETHING I REALLY WANT TO LISTEN TO AGAIN

THAT'S IT SEEMS I'VE GOT A LOT TO CATCH UP ON FEELS LIKE ALL I DO IS LISTEN TO NEW METAL TOO THERE WAS A BUNCH OF ALBUMS I LOVED THAT I DIDN'T SEE HERE BUT I'LL LEAVE LISTING THEM TIL A FUTURE POST

EDIT SPELLING

DECIBEL I THINK YOU NEED TO REVIEW YOUR CHOICES

COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE NO SUMMERLAND SO GTO
THIS IS SHIT NO ULCERATE GET FUCKED
DARK TRANQUILITY KVELERTAK
MISSING FROM THIS LIST

UNFATHOMABLE RUINATION BRUTALLY DECEASED FLESHHOOD APOCALYPSE ABNORMALITY VADER WITHERSCAPE HYPERION MISTER HEAVEN SHALL BURN AND AMON MARTH

I SUPPOSE VECTOR SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN A TOP LIST EVEN IF I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE ALBUM
I'M SURPRISED I DISAGREE WITH THIS LIST AS MUCH AS I DO USUALLY DECIBEL SEEMS TO HAVE A SLIGHTLY BETTER LIST THAN MOST OTHER PUBLICATIONS I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW BAD THOSE ARE GONNA BE ALSO THE ONLY LIST THAT BOLDER ALBUM SHOULD BE ON IS MOST OBVIOUS DISAPPOINTMENTS OF THE LAST DECADE
LOL
CLICKED ON THIS WITHOUT SEEING THE FFA AND THEN SWITCHED TAB DAMN THIS IS SWEET AND OF COURSE I'D HAVE EXPECTED IT TO BE HAD I SEEN THE FFA FIRST

I WAS SUPER CONFUSED WHEN I CLICKED ON IT THOUGH THINKING THE THUMBNAIL WAS THE ALBUM COVER AND SEEING IT TAGGED TRADITION
MUCH BETTER THAN THE OTHER LATER CRAPPY SWEDISH BAND CALLED THE SAME THING
JUST DISCOVERED THIS BAND FEW WEEKS AGO AWESOME
HIGH ENERGY

PROPS FOR REFERENCING THE ONE TRUMP MEME I ACTUALLY LIKE THE MUSIC IS PRETTY GOOD AS WELL SO HAVE AN UNVOTE
APPARENTLY ARIZMENDA AND VIOLAN BOTH CAME THROUGH MY CITY LAST MONTH AND I HAD NO IDEA I'M STILL BUMMED THAT I MISSED THEM
JUST BOUGHT THIS ONE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO GREAT ALBUM
THERE'S ANOTHER BAND CALLED RUST BUT THEY'RE FROM SWEDEN AND ARE MORE CURRENT AND THEY SOUND JUST LIKE DARKTHRONE
I'M SURPRISED THESE ARE VIDEOS CREATIVE SHIT LIKE THEM OR NOT CONFUSION AND DREAM NO MORE ARE MORE VIDEOS THAN THE ONES FOR HARDWIRE MOTH INTO FLAME AND ATLAS RISE WHICH WERE BASICALLY WELL THE BAND PLAYING
DREAM NO MORE SOUNDS LIKE WHAT LOAD AND RELOAD SHOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE
READ THIS AS

MEGADEATH THE NEW METALLICA VIDEOS

MAN UNKIND
INTRO IS AWESOME LOVE HOW IT GETS HEAVY PRETTY QUICK IT QUICKLY LOSES IT'S MOMENTUM WITH A VERY GROOVE I LIKE THE VOCALS ON THE INTERLUDE BUT ID SAY THIS IS THE WEAKEST TRACK ON THE ALBUM

CONFUSION
HAS A MONSTER MAIN RIFF NOT ENTIRELY SOLD ON HETFIELDS SINGING ON THIS ONE I THINK THIS IS HIS WEAKEST TRACK VOCAL WISE BUT I LOVE THE MAIN RIFF

HERE COMES REVENGE ANOTHER SONG WITH A MONSTER MAIN RIFF LARS DOES A GOOD JOB ON THIS ONE

NOW THAT WERE DEAD I LIKE IT IT'S PRETTY GOOD HARD ROCK BUT NOTHING REMARKABLE LYRICS ARE CHEESY THOUGH AND I CAN'T HELP BUT HEAR SHAWN SWF ENTRANCE MUSIC WHEN THE SONG COMES ON

MURDER ONE I LOVE THIS ONE GREAT TRIBUTE TO LEMMY

AM I SAVAGE ANOTHER MEDIOCRE TRACK BUT I DO REALLY LIKE PARTS OF IT THE PRE CHORUS SOUNDS LIKE MEGADEATH WHICH IS FUNNY BUT MY FAVORITE PART IS THAT HEAVY AS FUCK SHUGGY RIFF IN THE MIDDLE IT'S DIRTY AS FUCK

ATLAS RISE A BIT DISJOINTED BUT GOD I LOVE THE IRON MAIDEN STYLE HARMONIES ON THIS ONE

DREAM NO MORE FUCKING GREAT GETTING A HUGE SABBATH DOOM ALICE IN CHAINS VIBE CTHULHU THEME IS ALWAYS WELCOME IN MY BOOK YOU TURN TO STONE LYRICS ARE VERY CATCHY

HALO ON FIRE I THINK THIS IS MY FAVORITE ON THE ALBUM GREAT LYRICS GREAT ATMOSPHERE AMAZING SINGING AND THAT ENDING PART IS COOL AS FUCK IT'S NEW METALLICA AT IT'S BEST

SPIT OUT THE BONE GOOD SHIT PROBABLY TIED WITH HALO ON FIRE AS MY FAVORITE LOVE THE BASS SOLO

LORDS OF SUMMER I DONT REALLY COUNT THIS AS PART OF THE ALBUM SINCE IT'S A BUT IT'S PRETTY MPH IT SOUNDS TIMES BETTER THAN THE VERSION THEY RELEASED A FEW YEARS BACK THOUGH

NONE OF THE MUSIC VIDEOS REALLY IMPRESSED ME EXCEPT FOR DREAM NO MORE

I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE BURSTING BY NOW BUT IT SEEMS THEY'VE ALL GONE BACK TO THEIR HIDE HOLES
LATE TO THE PARTY JUST NOTICED THIS THREAD TODAY

DAMN I'M ACTUALLY PRETTY IMPRESSED THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE MAYBE PUPPETS THAT THEY AREN'T SOUNDING LIKE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO PROVE

JUSTICE WE CAN STILL BE HEAVY COMPLEX WITHOUT CLIFF

BLACK WE'RE GONNA BE THE NEXT AC DC ARENAS WILL PLAY US THE WORLD OVER

LOAD WE'RE CLASSY NOT ANOTHER THRASH METAL BAND

RELOAD I DON'T THINK YOU HEARD US THE FIRST TIME I SAID WE'RE CLASSY DAMMIT

STREET ANGER LOOK WE'RE BACK AND ANGRY AND HEAVY AND WE STILL GOT THAT YOUNG AGGRESSION TOTALLY NOT A MID-LIFE CRISIS SERIOUS GUYS

DEATH MAGNETIC SEE WE CAN STILL DO THRASH WE HAVEN'T LOST IT IN OUR AGE WE GOT THIS LOOK GUYS WE'RE LOUD IT'S CLIPPING THAT MEANS IT'S

THIS ONE FINALLY FEELS LIKE THEY SAID AH FUCK IT LET'S JUST HAVE FUN AND WRITE SOME MUSIC AND TOUR THERE'S LITTLE BITS AND PIECES OF EVERY ALBUM REPRESENTED ON HERE I'M HAPPY I LIKE THIS IT'S NOT GONNA BE ALBUM OF THE YEAR OR ANYTHING BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ACTUALLY BACK FOR REAL AS THEIR HONEST SELVES
DREAM NO MORE

DAMN JAMES LOOKING CLASSY LIKE HE'S GOING FOR A JOB INTERVIEW OR SOMETHING
SPIT OUT THE BONE IS HERE

WHAT A TUNE TO END THE ALBUM
I'M ONLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY DIDN'T WRITE A SONG TITLED THE UNFORGIVEN REALLY A MISSED OPPORTUNITY THERE
ITT PURE SALT
I LOVE METALLICA AND DEFEND EVEN SOME OF THEIR SHITTIER WORK BUT GOD DAMN IS THEIR VISUAL ART DIRECTION A FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT

VISUALS THAT METALLICA HAS DONE THAT WERE COOL

ORIGINAL LOGO

ONE VIDEO

LOAD COVER

PARTS OF THE MOVIE

HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE

FIGHT ME IRL
MANUNKIND WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK
SPIT OUT THE BONE IS HERE U AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF THIS ISN'T THE BEST FUCKING TRACK ON THE ALBUM

NEXT HERE COMES REVENGE DIRECTED BY JESSICA COPE

CARTOONS WOOHOO ERR CREEPY
METALLICA IS AT A POINT IN THEIR CAREER THAT THEY JUST DON'T GIVE A FUCK AND I MEAN THAT IN A GOOD WAY THEY'RE DOING WHATEVER SEEMS FUN TO THEM AND I FOR ONE AND IN IT UNTIL THE END LONG LIVE METALLICA
HONESTLY I EXPECTED SOMETHING SIMILAR TO DEATH MAGNETIC AND THAT IS NOT WHAT WE GOT I CAN SEE DM SPRINKLED HERE AND THERE BUT WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A MIXTURE OF STUFF I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN FROM METALLICA AND THEN SOME VERY RECOGNIZABLE INFLUENCES FROM THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS

HARDWIRED A CATCHY AND PUNCHY WAY TO START A METAL ALBUM VERY THRASH SHORT AND JUST A NICE TREATISE IT'S VERY SUGAR-COATED OF COURSE WITH CHEESY LYRICS BUT IT'LL EASILY BE THE MOST MAINSTREAM TRACK THE FORTUNATE PART OF IT BEING MAINSTREAM IS THAT IT ISN'T TERRIBLE

ATLAS RISE THE RIFF AND TONE IS DEFINITELY VERY DEATH MAGNETIC IT FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THEY WERE HOPING TO GO IN A JOCK JAM POWERFUL LIVE TRACK AND THAT'S WHAT THEY GOT OTHERWISE IT'S JUST A NICE LISTEN BUT NOT MUCH MORE

NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD THIS SONG'S GOT A NICE GROOVE TO IT BUT IT HAD TO GROW ON ME LYRICS ARE PRETTY TRASH BUT ON POINT

MOTH INTO FLAME THE INTRO IS PRETTY AWESOME HONESTLY THE CHUGGING RIFF IS THRASH THE INTERLUDE INTO THE CHORUS IS LIKE FLYING HIGH AS JAMES TELLS YOU IMAGERY THROUGH THE MUSIC IS THERE REMINDS ME A LOT OF DEATH MAGNETIC MIXED WITH STREET ANGER AGGRESSION AND A THRASH TONE BUT WITH SOME IMPROVED SOUND I WAS INSTANTLY IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG EVEN WITH IT BEING SLIGHTLY GENERIC I FEEL LIKE IT'S ONE SONG THAT WILL GET PEOPLE HOOKED TO THE ALBUM WHERE THEY'LL FIND SOME OF THE BETTER TRACKS

DREAM NO MORE A HEAVY TRACK BUT COMING OFF OF THE QUICK TEMPO OF THE PREVIOUS FOUR TRACKS IT FEELS OFFICIAL IT'S A GREAT SONG NONETHELESS I FEEL LIKE SABBATH WRITTEN THIS I'M HEAVILY REMINDED OF SOME OF THEIR EARLIER TRACKS THE DEVIL YOU KNOW AS WELL ACTUALLY CTHULHU AS A SUBJECT FOR THE SONG JUST MAKES THIS SONG COOL

HALO ON FIRE THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST TRACKS ON THE ALBUM I CAN SEE THE DEATH MAGNETIC INFLUENCE BUT IT HAS INFLUENCES FROM OLDER TRACKS TOO WHICH IS GREAT JAMES SINGING IS ACTUALLY GOOD ON THIS SONG THE INTERLUDE HALFWAY THROUGH THE SONG IS CLASSIC METALLICA IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS HOPING TO SEE THEM DO IT BUILDS AND SURPRISES YOU WITH HOW IT DOESN'T JUST DROP OFF INTO CRAP LIKE YOU'D EXPECT FROM MODERN METALLICA

CONFUSION THE SONG STARTS OFF WITH THIS DARKER MORE DISTURBING TONE TO INDICATE THAT JAMES DECIDED TO SING ABOUT SOME SORT OF DARK UNCOMFORTABLE SUBJECT THE VIDEO WAS ABOUT PTSD SO I IMAGINE THAT'S THE FEEL THEY WERE GOING FOR CONSIDERING THE SONG BUILDS IN A WAY THAT IS WHAT I IMAGINE IS REMINISCENT OF HAVING THE DISORDER LYRICS ARE PRETTY DECENT BITS OF IT REMIND ME OF WHY THE LYRICS OF MASTER OF PUPPETS WERE SO GOOD THE SINGING ITSELF WAS PRETTY LAX THOUGH IT DOESN'T HAVE THE AGGRESSION THAT I'D EXPECT OF SOMEONE WANTING TO RID THEMSELVES OF THE PAIN JAMES MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THEY'VE GIVEN INTO THE PAIN AND ARE BEGGING FOR IT TO BE TAKEN FROM THEM

MANUNKIND THIS IS THE OBVIOUS TRACK FOR BEING THE WORST SONG ON THE ALBUM IT STARTS OFF COOL AND HAS THAT NICE EVIL TONE THAT THEY WERE GOING FOR BUT IT JUST FALLS APART AND BORED ME TO DEATH HALFWAY THROUGH LIKE HOW DO YOU START WITH THIS AMAZING INTRO AND JUST TRAIL OFF INTO NOTHINGNESS IT JUST FELT INCOMPLETE LIKE THEY WROTE IT IN THE SAME WAY THEY WROTE SOME OF THE LESSER STREET ANGER TRACKS IN REALITY IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE STREET ANGER TRACKS IN THE WAY THEY JUST COBBLED TOGETHER SOME DIFFERENT COOLER SOUNDING THINGS THAT DIDN'T WORK TOGETHER

HERE COMES REVENGE I REALLY LIKE THAT HORROR EVIL FEEL I GET FROM THIS TRACK THE VIDEO WAS ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER WOLFMAN OR SOMETHING BUT THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M FEELING IN THIS TRACK IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S JUST GONE OFF THE DEEP END AND TURNS TO EVIL AND MURDER I BELIEVE IT'S MORE OF SPEAKING AS IF REVENGE IS A PHYSICAL THING BUT IT'S SO EVIL LIKE AN HORROR FILM I CAN HEAR SOME INFLUENCE FROM DEATH MAGNETIC BUT IT'S DROWN OUT BY THE QUALITY OF THE TRACK AND THAT INTERLUDE BEFORE THE SOLO THOUGH

AM I SAVAGE I THOUGHT I HAD STARTED UP SOME SORT OF IRON MAIDEN TRACK AT FIRST THEN I WAS LIKE IS THIS MEGADEATH THEN IT HAS THIS SWEET GROOVE OF A RIFF THEN JAMES STARTS SINGING AND I FEEL LIKE I'M LISTENING TO STREET ANGER AGAIN IT'S BETTER THAN THAT AT LEAST BUT IT'S GOT SO MANY DIFFERENT STYLES GOING ON AT ONE TIME IT SOUNDS COOL BUT I'M NOT ON IF IT'S WORKING TOGETHER OR JUST A BUNCH OF COOL SOUNDS

MURDER ONE SHUGGY SHUGGY RIFF HERE IT'S AGGRESSIVE AND FUN JUST LIKE LEMMY THEN IT HITS THAT MAIN RIFF AND YOU FEEL RIGHT AT HOME CAN'T SAY THE SINGING IS SUPER GREAT BUT IT'S A GREAT LITTLE TRIBUTE TO THE GREATNESS OF LEMMY

SPIT OUT THE BONE DESPITE HAVING THE WACKIEST VIDEO I'VE SEEN THIS SIDE OF LATE CHILDREN'S SHOWS I FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING A POWER RANGERS STYLE VIDEO THE SONG IS DEFINITELY A IT STARTS OUT HARD AND FAST AND JUST DOESN'T STOP I HAVEN'T SEEN A TRACK LIKE THAT SINCE THE FIRST TWO ALBUMS THE INTRO BEEN RIPPED STRAIGHT FROM LEFTOVER KILL EM ALL NOTES THE LYRICS AND SINGING ARE WEIRD I MEAN THEY MATCH THE TONE AT LEAST BUT JAMES MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MUDSTAIN LATELY BECAUSE THE SUBJECT AND STYLE IS WAY MORE DAVE THAN WHAT METALLICA NORMALLY DOES MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT SOUNDS SLIGHTLY KILL EM ALL ONLY THING I CAN TRULY COMPLAIN ABOUT IS KIRK DECIDED TO GO NUTS ON THE WAH PEDAL DURING THE SOLO AGAIN OTHERWISE IT JUST CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO A BEAUTIFULLY HEAVY METAL TRACK WORTHY OF NAME OH AND THEY EVEN INCLUDED A SECOND GUITAR SOLO WHICH IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD

LORDS OF SUMMER EVER SINCE I HEARD THIS SONG THE FIRST TIME I LIKED THE IDEA OF IT IT HAS GREAT ENERGY AND SOME PRETTY NICE RIFFS NOW WITH SOME REFINEMENT AND STUDIO QUALITY IT SOUNDS A WHOLE LOT BETTER FIRST THING I NOTICED IS THE HEAVIER TONE IT JUST BEEN THE LIVE RECORDING BUT THEY PLAYED WITH THE TONE AND IT'S FANTASTIC NOW THIS IS DEFINITELY MADE FOR PLAYING LIVE IT DOESN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF SUBSTANCE OUTSIDE OF A LIVE PERFORMANCE BUT IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE A FUN SONG TO LISTEN TO LIVE OTHERWISE IT'S NOT TOO SPECIAL OR ANYTHING

I SHOULD NOTE THAT THEY DECIDED TO INCLUDE SOME EXTRA ON THE ACTUAL ALBUM IT'S LIVE TRACKS AND THREE COVERS BUT ALL THREE ARE GREAT RONNIE RISING IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE SONG MAYBE BESIDES TENACIOUS D'S TRACK ON THE BIO TRIBUTE ALBUM IT CAME FROM WHEN A BLIND MAN CRIES IS PRETTY DECENT AS WELL REMEMBER TOMORROW SHOWS JUST HOW WELL METALLICA CAN COVER SOME SONGS I LOVE IRON MAIDEN THEY'RE DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE BAND GIVE THEIR NEW ALBUM A LISTEN AS WELL IT'S PRETTY DAMN GOOD AND REMEMBER TOMORROW IS AN OFTEN FORGOTTEN TRACK THAT SOUNDS FANTASTIC WITH STYLE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE DISJOINTED INTRO THEY ADDED TO THE BEGINNING NOT SURE WHY THEY DECIDED TO DO THAT

ALL IN ALL I'M IMPRESSED WITH THIS ALBUM IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING AND I WASN'T DISAPPOINTED I WASN'T BLOWN AWAY EITHER THOUGH BUT AT THIS POINT WITH METALLICA I'M JUST LOOKING TO NOT BE DISAPPOINTED
THIS IS MY TOKEN COMMENT HERE BEFORE I IGNORE THIS THREAD UNTIL NEXT FRIDAY


I THINK MANUNKIND IS THE WEAKEST TRACK ON THE ALBUM OTHER THAN THE COOL INTRO AND THE INTERLUDE IT'S DEFINITELY THE MOST SONG ON THE ALBUM

KINDA DIG THE VIDEO THOUGH WISH IT HAD A METALLICA CAMEO AT THE END LOOKING OLD AS FUCK AND TERRIFIED WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY FUNNY
IT WAS SMART FOR THEM TO DO THIS THE ALBUM WILL ALWAYS BE ON YOUTUBE NO MATTER HOW MANY SHIT LOW QUALITY VERSIONS THEY REMOVE

PUTTING OUT THEIR OWN HIGH QUALITY VERSION CUTS DOWN PIRATING AND GIVES THEM THE MONEY FROM ADVERTISING AND BEING A YOUTUBE PARTNER
I WANT TO START A COUNT OF HOW MANY TIMES LARS USES A FUCKING TOM THAT ISN'T A FLOOR TOM COUPLED WITH A SNARE HIT IN ANY OF THESE SONGS

SO FAR ATLAS RISE AND MOTH IMPRESSED ME DRUMS ASIDE DREAM NO MORE WAS A MISS FOR ME
THE NEXT ONE HALO ON FIRE
HEY AT IN DREAM NO MORE IT'S ERIK BIG MONEY SALVIA WONDER IF HE KNOWS OR THEY JUST PULLED IT FROM THE WEB

AAAAAAAND POST
SPIT OUT THE BONE IS THE BEST METALLICA SONG IN AGES
I LOVE SORTILEGE
I'M DIGGING THE NEW MUSIC BUT LARS LOOKS LIKE AN OLD HOMELESS MAN BROKE INTO THE STUDIO TO PLAY WITH THE KITS
LAST ONE LORDS OF SUMMER DIRECTED BY BRETT MURRAY
SOME DECENT RIFFS FOR SURE SOME ARE ACTUALLY REALLY GREAT AND CATCHY
I FULLY EXPECT THREADS TO GET UNVOTED TO THE TOP OF THE FRONT PAGE BEFORE YOU CAN DELETE THEM ANYWAY AP

ME AS I REVIEW ALL OF THE NEW METALLICA VIDEOS WAS IT WORTH THE YEAR WAIT PROBABLY NOT BUT I'M DIVING IN ANYWAY

LAST TIME ON FIGHT FOR RELEVANCY

HARDWIRED

I CAN'T BE THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED THAT METALLICA IS STILL RIDING COATTAILS

MOTH INTO FLAME

I WONDER WHAT THEIR LIGHTBULB BUDGET WAS
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT GOING FULL LED IN MY HOUSE MIGHT BE AROUND TO REPLACE ALL THE BULBS BUT SHOULD I GET THOSE VINTAGE EDISON BULBS I MEAN THE LOOK COOL BUT I WONDER IF THEY ARE AT ALL WORTH IT FOR ACTUAL LIGHTING NEEDS ANYONE HERE WORK AT DO YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS I DON'T CARE FOR SOFT LIGHTING AND USUALLY GO FOR DAYLIGHT SO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

ATLAS RISE

LARS LOOKS HE'S CHOKING DOWN A HEART ATTACK

AND NOW THE NEW EPISODE OF FIGHT FOR RELEVANCY



DREAM NO MORE

I FEE LIKE ONCE YOU START TUCKING BUTTON DOWN SHIRTS IN TO JEANS YOU'VE EFFECTIVELY GIVEN UP ON LIFE
HOLY SHIT DID NO ONE THINK TO STOP JAMES WHEN THEY WERE RECORDING VOCALS
THIS VIDEO IS ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL VISUALLY ENGAGING THANK YOU DIRECTOR GUY
SERIOUSLY JAMES LOOKS LIKE HE JUST CAME FROM A PTA MEETING IN CUBA
WHAT'S UP WITH KIRK DID ROBERT STEAL THE ONE UNDERSHIRT THAT KIRK WORE FROM TO MATT PIKE ISN'T USING HIS COULDN'T HE HAVE BORROWED IT FOR MINUTES

CONFUSION

HEY GUYS WASN'T AND JUSTICE FOR ALL COOL
HEY GUYS WASN'T THE HURT LOCKER COOL
THIS WHOLE VIDEO COULD HAVE BEEN THE SLOW POURING OF COFFEE WHILE SHE STARES OFF INTO THE DISTANCE AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE WITH IT
I GOTTA WONDER IF THEY WANTED TO BE MORE ADVENTUROUS WITH THE MATERIAL FOR THE VIDEO AND TONED IT DOWN I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO HAVE THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT ON THAT THEY WERE HOPING FOR
MAN SO MANY KIDS IN IOWA ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THEIR MINDS BLOWN WHEN THEY SEE THIS

MANUNKIND

THAT TITLE IS ENOUGH TO KEEP ME FROM BUYING THIS ALBUM
REALLY
R SHITTHEFALSESAY MIGHT NEED A NEW BANNER IMAGE
THEY PICKED ONE OF THE LAMEST TRACKS TO HAVE A VIDEO POKING FUN AT MAYHEM
THESE LORDS OF CHAOS PRODUCTION VIDEOS ARE PRETTY UNDERWHELMING
THAT SHIT SOLO STICKS OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB
OME HE'S CUTTING HIMSELF THIS IS HORRIBLE WHAT IS METALLICA DOING HAVEN'T THEY HEARD OF AIDS WHAT KIND OF WEIRD PEOPLE WOULD DO THIS SHIT
SHOULD HAD DAVID CAMERON CATCH THE PIG'S HEAD AT THE END THERE
FINAL THOUGHTS YES METALLICA WE GET IT LARS BOUGHT DEATHCRUSH BUT WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY WITH THIS ONE YOU PICKED TEAM EUONYMOUS TWENTY YEARS TOO LATE DEAD WAS YOUR FAVORITE MAYHEM SINGER WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND

NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD

WAIT THIS IS DEBUTING ON PITCHFORK I'M SURE THOSE FLANNEL LOVING QUINOA FARMERS WERE WORKING THEMSELVES INTO AN COLLEGE FRENZY TO BE A PART OF THIS
HA LOOK AT THIS RIOTOUS DESCRIPTION FROM PITCHFORK THE CLIP S IMAGERY MIMICS THE ALBUM S ARTWORK THE BAND PERFORMS WHILE DEMONIC FOOTAGE OF THEIR FACES IS PROJECTED ONTO THEM WATCH IT BELOW HOLY SHIT THAT'S GOT ME PUMPED FOR THIS
NOT HATING THIS RIFF I GUESS THEY DECIDED TO GO BACK AND REDO MEDIOCRE BLACK ALBUM RIPOFFS
NEVERMIND
OK NOT TERRIBLE GOD DAMNIT I WAS GETTING SUCKED IN BY BLACK ALBUM BLACK MAGIC
CAN'T HATE A GOOD OLD PERFORMANCE VIDEO THIS IS REALLY ALL METALLICA HAS TO DO FOR A VIDEO
THAT'S A COOL PROGRESSION RUINED BY UTTERLY BLAND TONE
OME THE LIGHTS TURNED RED LOOK OUT UFO
I COULD HAVE WATCHED THIS ENTIRE VIDEO IN THIS STYLE GREAT USE OF THE ALBUM ARTICLE I DON'T HATE THE ART DIRECTION ON THIS ALBUM LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THIS VIDEO MAKES GOOD USE OF IT
THAT WAS NEW AND INTERESTING
THAT SOLO NOT SO MUCH
HEY AFA SNUCK IN AGAIN HI JUSTICE
THAT REFRAIN BASICALLY SUMS UP MODERN METALLICA APATHY
I JUST REALIZED THAT LARS IS WEARING A DIFFERENT SKULL CAP THIS ONE LOOKS MORE HOMELESS GUY CUTE
FINAL THOUGHTS I'M SHOCKED THIS WASN'T THE LEAD SINGLE IT'S JUST MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ENOUGH TO SELL IN MASSIVE NUMBERS TO SLIPKNOT EDGELORDS AND BASIC DADS WHO HEADBAND SOFTLY SO AS NOT TO IRRITATE THEIR SCIATICA

HERE COMES REVENGE

OH GOD THIS IS GETTING DIFFICULT
THAT IS THE MOST DEPRESSED JACKAL EVER
SERIOUSLY THIS ALBUM IS STARTING TO RUN TOGETHER
I THINK I MIGHT HANG MYSELF BEFORE THIS VIDEO IS OVER NONE OF THESE VIDEOS SEEM TO MATCH THE TONE OF THE SONGS WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUBJECTING MYSELF TO THIS ISN'T FUN ANYMORE I JUST WANT IT ALL TO END
THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY TO POINT OUT THE SONG WAS SHIT AND SO AM I FOR LISTENING TO IT

AM I SAVAGE

IT'S AND MY WIFE IS GETTING PISSED I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING SHAMELESS AND GIVING HER A MASSAGE BUT INSTEAD I'M STARING AT KIRK RECEDING HAIRLINE I'M NOT HATING THE DIRECTION ON THIS ONE I WONDER IF LARS HAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF ART UTILIZING NEGATIVE SPACE IN HIS COLLECTION THOUGH THIS COULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE BAND FUNDING NEW VIDEOS ALL AT ONE TIME I REGRET EVER STARTING ON THIS AND WONDER WHAT WILL COME OF MY WIFE AND CHILD WHEN I'M GONE I HATE MYSELF AND I WANT TO DIE
LARS IS PROGRESSING FURTHER INTO HOMELESSNESS
SOLIPSISM IS REAL ALBEIT SOMEWHAT RIDICULOUS I WILL NEVER GET OVER HIS FACE WHEN EATING THAT CAKE
JESUS CHRIST KIRK IS BORDERING ON KERRY KING SOLO TERRITORY
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO GO ON WITH THIS ONE THEY SEEM TO BE PHONING IT IN BY THIS POINT

HALO ON FIRE

I INVITED FOLKS FROM THE R METAL IRC TO HELP ME OUT WITH THIS ONE NO ONE WOULD TRY INSTEAD THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ETERNAL ALCHEMIST MY WIFE HAS GONE TO BED AND THE DOG HAS RUN INTO THE OTHER ROOM THE LIGHT HAS GONE OUT OF THIS WORLD AND WITH COMING OF EVERY THIRD HOUR I AM REMINDED THAT I AM ALONE
THANK GOD CHROME HAS AUTO TRANSLATE WHO THE FUCK READS GERMAN SADLY METAL HAMMER DIDN'T DELIVER BUT THE METALLICA BLOG DID
THIS INTRO ISN'T BAD
BRUISED WOMAN WITH BRUISES BLONDE BRUISED BOMBER IS SHE A VICTIM OF SPOUSAL ABUSE IS SHE INTO BMT IS SHE INTO AMA LET'S SEE
STOP SINGING JAMES STOP IT
OH THAT INTRO IS THE MAIN RIFF IS THAT IT REPEAT THAT RIFF OVER AND OVER UNTIL KIRK DOES A LAZY SOLO
WAIT HOLY SHIT THAT MINI SOLO WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT NO WAH IT WAS SUBDUED TO THE POINT THAT IT WAS ALMOST A LEAD MELODY
HAT WATCH LARS HAS A BASEBALL CAP WAY TO SWITCH UP IT DUDDER
THESE VIDEOS ARE GOING ON AND ON AND ON CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL THEM TO CUT IT DOWN CAN SOMEONE TELL THEM NOT EVERY SONG NEEDS TO BE MINUTES
I THINK I SAW LEBRON ON THE BUS
SHE'S AT THE SHOW IT'S GONNA GO OFF
PIT FIGHTER APPARENTLY CAPABLE OF KNOCKING OUT WINOS WITH A SINGLE PUNCH
OF COURSE HER ONLY WEAKNESS IS ANOTHER SKINNY LITTLE CHICK WITH BLACK HAIR
GOD THIS FIGHT IS ALMOST AS BORING AS METAL SUCKS V K WARSLUT
ACTUALLY KILLING IT ON THIS SONG HE'S NOT FILLING SPACE AND REALLY SEEMED TO BE FEELING THIS TRACK SOLO
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT RIFF AT WAS STOLEN FROM WYRD
SECOND SOLO KIRK SEEMS TO RETURN TO FORM SHINING DURING A REFRESHING PASSAGE ON THIS OTHERWISE BROWN ALBUM
FINAL THOUGHTS THIS TRACK REDEEMED THIS ALBUM FOR ME SOMEWHAT KIRK SEEMED ENERGIZED SO THAT WAS COOL ROBERT IS APPARENTLY WINDOW DRESSING AND INCREDIBLY UNDERUSED IN THIS BAND I THINK I'M GOING TO START A FIGHT CLUB NOW

MURDER ONE

I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN STAY UP FOR THIS
I EXPECT THAT IF ANY BAND IS GOING TO TREAT LEMMY WITH RESPECT IT WOULD BE METALLICA TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THAT'S HAPPENING BUT COME ON THIS SONG FUCKING BLOWS
I LOVE THAT IT'S ANIMATED SORELY NEEDED SHOT OF VARIETY IN THESE VIDEOS SO FAR EDIT YES I REMEMBER THAT JACKAL VIDEO EARLIER I'M SORRY THAT I DO
ONCE AGAIN THIS SONG IS ONE LONG MONOTONOUS DRILL TO THE TEMPLE
THESE SUBTITLES ARE A BIT LIFELESS SERIOUSLY LIKE THIS IS SOME FRENCH DOCUMENTARY ABOUT TRADE DEALS FUCKING BORING
I MAY START A DOOMSDAY CULT AFTER THIS
SOME OF THE IRC DUDES ARE CHIMING IN U PROTOCHAUD THE FLASH CUTS ARE IRRITATING AS HELL I LIKE THE BASS SNIPER RIFLE THING THO I'M FUCKING SICK OF THE DID YOU KNOW MOORHEAD HISTORY TIDBITS AT THE BOTTOM
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU GOING TO WRITE A SONG ABOUT LEMMY AND LET IT BE ONE OF THE SLOWEST MOST OVERDRAWN TRACKS ON THE ALBUM ARE WE LEARNING NOTHING ABOUT SPEED
HEY WENDY O I NEEDED A REASON TO JERK OFF BEFORE BED
HAT WATCH NO ANIMATED HATS WERE HARMING IN THE MAKING OF THIS VIDEO
U CHIMES IN WHILE ARE STUCK LISTENING TO THAT I'M SITTING HERE LISTENING TO DEAD CONGREGATION NONE OF US CARE NONE OF US HAVE THE ENERGY TO CARE NONE OF US WANT TO CARE WE HATE YOU MOB WE CARE ABOUT THAT
U PROTOCHAUD ASKS DID THEY ONLY HAVE LIKE ONE STOCK PHOTO OF FACE IT'S FREAKING ME OUT
FINAL THOUGHTS UGH I APPRECIATE THE AESTHETICS BUT JUST WATCH LEMMY AND FEEL BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF



I CAN'T STAY UP FOR THE REST I NEED TO GO TO BED AND NEVER WAKE UP

THAT BLACK METAL METALLICA LOGO IS PRETTY SWEET
I LIKED DEATH MAGNETIC A LOT AND WHAT I'VE HEARD OF THE NEW ALBUM SOUNDS FUN FUCK YEAH METALLICA
MANUNKIND DIRECTED BY JONAS ÅKERLUND

EDIT THIS VIDEO WTF
MANUNKIND WAS LIKE A TRIBUTE TO MAYHEM I LIKED IT I STILL THINK THE SONG NAME IS KIND OF DUMB THOUGH
PROOF THAT SHREDDING IS FULL OF JADED ASSHOLES
BASS I CAN FINALLY HEAR THE BASS LINE
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH OF A WASTED OPPORTUNITY THE VIDEO FOR AM I SAVAGE IS

IT WAS A GOOD CONCEPT AND GOT HALFWAY THERE THE ACTOR WAS CAPABLE BUT DAMN THE DIRECTION WAS WEIRD DUDE WAS HUGGING CHAIRS AND SHAVING WITH CAKE STUFF PLUS COULD HAVE FIXED THE GREY SUITS A BIT TO NOT LOOK SO DINKY

ALSO FUCKING ROB HELICOPTERING OUT OF NOWHERE ACTUALLY GOT ME OFF-GUARD AND I LAUGHED
NEXT NOW THAT WE RE DEAD DIRECTED BY HERRING HERRING


ANOTHER ONE MURDER ONE
SO I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THESE AS THEY'VE COME OUT MOST ARE PRETTY SOLID OVERALL I THINK I'LL SAY THAT THE FIRST TRACK THEY RELEASED GREW ON ME OVER TIME AND I QUITE ENJOY THEM NOW SOME OF THE STUFF RELEASED OVER THE LAST HOURS ISN'T THE BEST BUT THE ALBUM IS STILL PROBABLY THEIR MOST SOLID RELEASE IN DECADES A

SPIT OUT THE BONE IS PROBABLY THE STANDOUT FOR ME AT THE MOMENT THAT SONG JUST CRANKS THE LYRICS AREN'T BAD AND I THINK JAMES PROBABLY SOUNDS HIS BEST ON THIS TRACK

I DON'T THINK I'M NOT ALONE IN SAYING THAT I STRAIGHT UP HATED STREET ANGER AND DEATH MAGNETIC THE FORMER WAS SO BAD I CAN'T FORGET IT AND THE LATER WAS SO BAD I CAN'T REMEMBER IT BUT THIS THIS IS GOOD AND I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED
WAAAAYYYYY BETTER THEN THE STAGE









THAT ONE SUCKED
HARDWIRED VERY AMAZING TRACK THAT GOES BACK TO THEIR TRADITION OF STARTING AN ALBUM WITH AN INSANE THRASHER EX HIT THE LIGHTS FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE BATTERY BLACKENED THAT WAS JUST YOUR LIFE VERY STRONG OPENER



ATLAS RISE FROM THE THREE SINGLES THIS WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK THE MOST TIME FOR ME TO ADJUST MY BALLATE TO ITS NOT BAD AT ALL REALLY THOUGH NOT MY FAVORITE ITS NOT BAD





NOW THAT WERE DEAD THE INTRO IS AMAZING AND IT HAS A REALLY GOOD GROOVY VIBE TO IT VERY GOOD DRUMWORK FROM LARS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE CATCHIEST ON THE ALBUM ALTHOUGH IT DOES DRAG ON FOR A LITTLE MORE THAN IT SHOULD BUT ITS A GOOD TRACK NONETHELESS





MOTH INTO FLAME MY FAVORITE OFF THE ALBUM YOU CAN HEAR THE DEATH MAGNETIC AND EVEN IRON MAIDEN INFLUENCES VERY STRONG IN THIS SONG THE CHORUS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PART OF THE SONG WITH A VERY STRONG MESSAGE EASILY THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM





DREAM NO MORE THIS ONE IS ABIT MORE INTERESTING ITS CLEAR THAT THIS IS PURE LOAD RELOAD INFLUENCED THINK ABOUT FIXXXER THE MEMORY REMAINS OUTLAW TORN AND UNFORGIVEN II WHEN LISTENING TO THIS ONE VERY GROOVY AND A VERY INTERESTING TULU EFFERENCE IN THE CHORUS OVERALL NOT MY FAVORITE TRACK MORE LIKE AN AVERAGE TRACK ON THE RECORD





HALO ON FIRE THE CLASSIC METALLICA QUASSIBALLAD IN THE TRADITION OF HAVING ATLEAST ONE SOFTIE ON EACH METALLICA ALBUM FADE TO BLACK WELCOME HOME SANITARIUM ONE UNFORGIVEN UNTIL IT SLEEPS THE DAY THAT NEVER COMES THIS ONE IS AN INCREDIBLY STRONG TRACK THE HELLO DARKNESS SAY GOODBYE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS ON THE WHOLE ALBUM INCREDIBLY STRONG TRACK THAT REALLY SHOWCASES EVERYTHING METALLICA IS CAPABLE OF





CONFUSION FROM THE THE AM I EVIL INTRO IS NOTABLE ALSO THE DRUM PART AFTER THE INTRO REMINDS ME OF CYANIDE I LIKE THE LYRICS BECAUSE THEY DEAL WITH THE VERY REAL STRUGGLES OF PTSD THE RIFFS KINDA FALL FLAT ON THIS ONE THOUGH I WAS EXPECTING A GOOD BRIDGE RIFF TO SEAL THE DEAL BUT WE DIDNT GET IT NOT A BAD TRACK BUT COULDVE DONE BETTER





MANUNKIND EVERY ALBUM HAS IT THE THROWAWAY TRACK OF THE ALBUM THIS IS EASILY MY LEAST FAVORITE SONG ON THE WHOLE ALBUM NOT BEALING AT ALL INSPIRED ALSO THE TITLE IS JUST UGH THE VIDEO CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE WITH A TRIBUTE TO BLACK METAL LEGENDS MAYHEM REALLY THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THIS MESS IS THE INTRODUCTION





HERE COMES REVENGE OK IM JUST GONNA SAY IT I FUCKING LOVE THIS SONG THE VERY SINISTER FEEL OF THE SONG IS REALLY AMAZING THE BASS AND DRUMS REALLY BRING THE SONG HOME WITH VOCALS THE GUITARS ARENT REALLY AMAZING HOWEVER BUT I JUST LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE IN THIS SONG AND THE VIDEO IS SO UNSETTLING





AM I SAVAGE WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS ONE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE SAME SONG AS DREAM NO MORE ANOTHER HEAVILY LOAD RELOAD INFLUENCED TRACK IM STARTING TO NOTICE THAT GROOVE HAS BEEN PRETTY NOTABLE THROUGHOUT THE RECORD I WOULD SAY THIS TRACK IS AVERAGE UNTIL IT GOES SILENT AND THE VERY RIFF COMES IN BEFORE THE SOLO IT ACTUALLY SAVES THIS TRACK FROM BEING A THROWAWAY BUT STILL NOT THE BEST BUT NOT ENTIRELY TERRIBLE





MURDER ONE THIS TRIBUTE TO THE LEMMY KILMISTER STARTS OFF WITH A CLEAN RIFF VERY SIMILAR TO SANITARIUM AFTER THAT A VERY SECTION COMES ON I THINK THIS TRACK WOULD-BE FARED BETTER IF IT WAS AN ACTUAL MOORHEAD SONG WITH A SLIGHTLY FASTER TEMPO OVERALL IT DIDNT REALLY DIDNT REACH MY EXPECTATIONS





SPIT OUT THE BONE WOW JUST FUCKING WOW METALLICA ALSO HAS HAD A HABIT OF CLOSING OUT THE ALBUM WITH ANOTHER THRASHER METAL MILITIA DAMAGE INC DYERS EVE MY APOCALYPSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE A THRASH SANDWICH WITH A POWERFUL INTRO AND CLOSING SONG THIS IS WHAT WE ALL WANTED FROM THEM SINCE JUSTICE AND THEY DELIVERED ALSO CLIFF IS VERY MUCH ALIVE THROUGH ROBERT TRUJILLO WITH THAT DISTORTED BASS SOLO VERY STRONG WAY TO END THE RECORD





LORDS OF SUMMER ITS A PRETTY DECENT TRACK BUT IT GENERALLY FEELS ABIT UNINSPIRED AND I HATE THE TITLE BUT ITS NOT A BAD TRACK THE BRIDGE IS REALLY AWESOME BUT IT IS ABIT REPETITIVE





BEST SONGS HARDWIRED MOTH INTO FLAME HALO ON FIRE HERE COMES REVENGE SPIT OUT THE BONE




NEED TO LISTEN MORE ATLAS RISE DREAM NO MORE AM I SAVAGE CONFUSION




WORST SONGS MURDER ONE MANUNKIND





OVERALL THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY SOLID IT DOES SUFFER FROM DRAGGING OUT TOO LONG ON SOME PARTS BUT THERES ALOT OF FEELING AND EMOTION AND ATMOSPHERE IN SOME OF THESE SONGS THAT JUST CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED NOT QUITE AS CRAZY OR TECHNICAL AS DEATH MAGNETIC BUT THAT GAVE WAY FOR VERY GOOD LYRICS AND SONGWRITING JAMES HATFIELD IS DEFINITELY THE STRONGEST FACTOR HERE BOTH VOCALLY LYRICALLY AND IN HIS GUITAR WORK ITS NOT PERFECT BUT ITS PRETTY SATISFYING





IM GONNA GIVE IT A PUSHING ON


HOLY FUCK HERE COMES VIDEO WAS CREEPY AS HELL
IM NOT REALLY FEELING THE VIDEO FOR CONFUSION I DIG THE SONG LOVE THE MAIN RIFF BUT THE VIDEO IS KINDA BORING WISH THEY WENT ALL OUT WITH ACTION AND STUFF INSTEAD OF JUST SHOTS OF A RANDOM SOLDIER RUNNING AROUND AN EMPTY WARZONE WITH ZERO GUNFIRE EXPLOSIONS AND ALL THAT OTHER SUPER FUN WAR SHIT THE OFFICE SCENES HAD MORE GOING ON IN THEM FOR CHRISTSAKE GUESS THEY ARE KEEPING THESE VIDEOS PRETTY LOW BUDGET
YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT METALLICA I SEE PEOPLE SAY THINGS LIKE WELL IT'S NOT LIKE THEY COULD GO BACK TO THEIR OLD SOUND I MEAN WHY NOT

I'M NOT SAYING THEY SHOULD OR EVEN THAT I'D WANT THEM TO BUT AT THIS POINT THEY COULD HAVE ANY SOUND THEY WANT I GET WHY THEY ADOPTED A MORE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL SOUND IN THE S BUT BY NOW THEY'RE ALL RICH AS FUCK SURELY THEY'RE DOING THIS STUFF AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THEY LOVE DOING IT I LISTEN TO THEIR GUITAR TONE AND I JUST DON'T GET WHY THEY WOULD CHOOSE IT THIS CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THE GUITAR TONE RIGHT KIRK STILL HAS HIS STILL UNPOPULAR WAH SOLOS SO MAYBE IT REALLY IS WHAT THEY PREFER

JUST TO REITERATE I'M NOT SAYING THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO THEIR YEAR OLD SOUND MY POINT IS THAT THEY COULD REALLY HAVE ANY SOUND THEY WANT AT THIS POINT


SPIT OUT THE BONE MV JUST RELEASED

AND HERE IS THE ARTICLE
SADLY THE SINGLES WERE THE BEST THEY HAD TO OFFER IT SEEMS MANUNKIND IS PROBABLY THE WORST TRACK ON THE ALBUM AT LEAST THE VIDEO WAS COOL
I DUNNO ITS STILL LACKING THE OOMPH THAT METALLICAL FIRST ALBUMS HAD

IT'S DECENT MUCH BETTER THAN LOAD RELOAD AND THE PRODUCTION IS MILES BETTER THAN DEATH MAGNETIC I GUESS I'M JUST NOT A FAN OF THE PROGRESSIVE SONG STRUCTURES AND I REALLY JUST CAN'T STAND VOCALS I'M GLAD FOR HIM AND HIS SOBRIETY BUT THOSE CLASSES STRAIGHT UP RUINED HIS SINGING

MY THRASH THIRST WILL CONTINUE TO BE FILLED BY BANDS LIKE GAR GHOUL VEATOR MUNICIPAL WASTE IRON REAGAN BAT NOISE ETC
I CAN'T WAIT TO LISTEN TO IT THE RECORD STORE NEAR ME IS HAVING A LISTENING PARTY FOR THE RELEASE TOMORROW NIGHT ALBUM ART IS A BUMMER THOUGH
JUST FINISHED A LISTEN THROUGH IMHO OF COURSE

THEIR BEST WORK SINCE THE BLACK ALBUM SOME OF MOST INSPIRED IF NOT MOST TECHNICAL GUITAR WORK IN YEARS PLENTY OF WAH BUT ALSO PLENTY OF THE SONGWRITING IS SOLID AS FUCK I LIKE THE LONG TRACK TIMES

I WOULD HAVE LIKED A LITTLE LESS BRIGHTNESS ON THE SNARE DRUM CAN'T KEEP LARS THE CONTROL FREAK OUT OF THE FINAL MIX AND TO LET ROB PLAY MORE
I LOVE THAT ATLAS RIIIIIIIIIISE IT'S GORGEOUS
I WAS THINKING WASN'T THERE A BAND NOT SURE IF METAL OR ROCK THAT PUT OUT A VIDEO FOR EVERY SONG ON AN ALBUM I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER BUT I'M PRETTY SURE SOME BAND DID THIS A FEW YEARS AGO
SO THEY'VE PRETTY MUCH LOAD WITH A COUPLE THRASH SONGS THROWN IN
I JUST SPENT A SOLID LAUGHING AT THE MANUNKIND SONG AND THE VIDEO WHAT THE FUCK AHHAHAHAHAHAHAH

EVEN BETTER IT'S PROBABLY THE SLOWEST LAMEST METALLICA SONG OF ALL TIME


HAHAHAHAHAH
A
HAAAHH

I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE THIS ANYMORE


EDIT I'M STILL GIGGLING ABOUT IT AND THESE RESPONDS FROM TRUE METALHEADS JUST MADE ME BURST OUT LAUGHING I DIDN'T KNOW METALLICA COULD BRING SO MUCH JOY TO ME
AUH SOME IDEAS SOUND AS IF THEY HAVE FOUND THEM ON THE STREET ON A PHONE LOST BY SOMEBODY

REALLY CHEWY
THE VIDEOS THEMSELVES ARE ALL PRETTY GOOD I LIKE THE OLD SCIFI THEMES AND THE POKIE WIFEBEATER BUT THE MUSIC SEEMS LIKE A COLLECTION OF THAT NEVER MADE IT TO THEIR REAL ALBUMS POST LOAD RELOAD

I DON'T GET THE REJUVENATED EXCITEMENT PEOPLE ARE HAVING SO FAR I FEEL LIKE THIS IS JUST AN EXTENSION OF TRYING TO MAKE MUSIC THEY THINK PEOPLE WANT THEM TO MAKE

UNINSPIRED IS THE WORD I'D USE FOR IT
SPIT OUT THE BONE
EUCKEN HELL THAT DRUM PRODUCTION IS HORRIBLE WTF WERE THEY THINKING

ANYONE HAS CHECKED OUT WHICH OF THESE SONGS ARE BALLADS PRETTY SURE THEY'VE RELEASED AT LEAST ONE BALLAD PER ALBUM
JUST WATCHED MOST OF THE LORDS OF CHAOS VIDEO STYLISTICALLY A TOTAL MESS I DIAGNOSE THE SONG ITSELF AS STONER
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO

I WAS LOOKING FORWARD FOR THAT SPAM OF METALLICA VIDEOS THREADS
METALLICA THESE DAYS SOUNDS LIKE THEY DECIDED TO TURN THEIR GAIN UP TO ABOUT I THINK A LOT OF THEIR NEWER SONGS WOULD SOUND BETTER THAN THEY DO IF THEY HAD SOME ACTUAL DISTORTION TO THEM THE GUITARS JUST SEEM SO FLAT I AM NOT SAYING THE SONGS WOULD BE GREAT BUT BETTER THAN THEY ARE NOW LAST EFFORT STILL KILLS THIS AND DEATH MAGNETIC IMO
REALLY LIKE THE RIFF ON CONFUSION THE SOLO IS CRAP AND THE LYRICS ARE A MIXED BAG BUT THAT RIFF DEFINITELY WARRANTS REPEAT LISTENING MANUNKIND IS ONE OF THE WORST TITLES FOR A SONG EVER AND THE SONG ITSELF IS ALSO PRETTY BORING DREAM NO MORE SOUNDS LIKE IT'S STRAIGHT OFF THE BLACK ALBUM OR LOAD RELOAD WHICH TO ME IS NOT A GOOD THING NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD IS MORE BA LOAD RELOAD DECENTLY CATCHY BUT THERE'S JUST NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT TOO RUN OF THE MILL

LUCKILY I REALLY LIKED THE SINGLES REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SPIT OUT THE BONE VIDEO THAT MIGHT THE BEST METALLICA SONG I'VE HEARD SINCE THE AFA DAYS
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THEY WANT TO CRAP ON THEIR OWN LEGACY ON MAINSTREAM METAL IN GENERAL

NOW THEY HAVE TO CRAP ON UNDERGROUND METAL
THIS ALBUM IS FUCKING FANTASTIC
SOUNDS ALMOST LIKE SEEDEATER IF THEY PICKED UP THE PACE
SAME SINGER GUITAR PLAYER FROM SCYTH NA DÉITHE I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS VOCALS IT REMINDS ME OF MIKAEL AKERFELDT OVER MENACING BLACK METAL
METAL UNDERGROUND LINK

TREVOR STRNAD GUEST VOCALS ON A SONG GOING TO BE FUCKING AWESOME
TERRIBLE BAND HILARIOUS HOW THE VENUE AT FROST AND FIRE TRICKLED TO OTHER AREAS WHILE THEY PLAYED
BTL IN THE HOUSE
THIS SONG ALONG MARE NOSTRUM AND LEGACY OF THE SNAKE HAS BEEN MY FAVORITES FROM THE ALBUM FEELS LIKE THIS WAS RELEASED JUST YESTERDAY

GREAT PICK
LP WHEN
ALSO FFA THY CATAFALQUE SIDE NOTE HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE THIS SHIT I KEEP SAYING THY CATTLE FOLK
I WONDER WHAT THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN UP TO HAVEN'T THEY BEEN WORKING ON A FOLLOW UP FOR A WHILE

GREAT ALBUM BTW ALL OF CREATIVITY SEEMED TO LEAVE WITH THEM
MASTER S HAMMER RITUAL

WHAT A STRANGE CREATURE YOU ARE AN ALBUM FULL OF FUZZED OUT RIFFS MELDED INTO A WHIRLING BLACK METAL ABOMINATION THE GUITAR TONE SOUNDS MORE LIKE IT BELONGS ON A TRAD DOOM RECORD THAN ON A CLASSIC BLACK METAL ALBUM BUT THAT DOESN T MEAN IT DOESN T WORK SPEAKING OF THE GUITARS STORM CHUCKLE AND NECROCOCK HEARTY CHUCKLE DON T GIVE TWO SHITS PROBABLY NOT EVEN ONE IF I HAD TO GUESS ABOUT STICKING TO ANY KIND OF TEMPLATE IN THEIR RIFFING THEY JUMP BACK AND FORTH FROM ICY BLACK METAL TO SOARING TWIN HEAVY METAL MELODIES TO SPEED METAL OFTEN WITHIN THE SPAN OF THE SAME SONG THE DRUMS LIKE THE REST OF THE ALBUM HAVE A ZANY AND UNPREDICTABLE QUALITY WHAT TOTALLY SOLD ME ON THIS ALBUM WAS THE VOCALS THE HOWLED DESPAIRING VOCALS SOUND AS IF THEY COME FROM A MENTALLY UNSTABLE MANIAC THE VOCALS COME ACROSS AS BEING EXPRESSIVE EMOTIONAL AND BALLS OUT CRAZY ALL AT ONCE NEVER A BAD THING ACROSS THE ALBUM I LIKED WHAT FELT LIKE THE EXPERIMENTAL TINGE TO A LOT OF THE SONGS IT NEVER FELT QUITE LIKE STRAIGHT UP BLACK METAL THERE WAS ALWAYS A HINT OF UNEASINESS A TWISTING HARD TO PIN DOWN NEBULOUSNESS THAT KEPT ME RIVETED FROM START TO FINISH RITUAL LIKE WALKING THROUGH A BLACK METAL FANHOUSE

DESTROYER UNCHAIN THE WOLVES

THIS IS MY SECOND FORAY INTO AFTER COLD STEEL I IMMEDIATELY LIKED THE RAWER PRODUCTION AND PERFORMANCES ON THIS ALBUM ADDITIONALLY I LIKE THAT THE VOCALS LEAN A LITTLE MORE TO THE BLACK METAL SIDE OF THINGS THAN ON S MORE RECENT ALBUMS I TYPICALLY DON'T LIKE MY THRASH OR BLACK METAL TO HAVE QUITE THE PUNKY FEEL THAT I GET FROM BUT IT'S MADE UP FOR BY THE RAW INTENSITY THAN RUNS THROUGHOUT ALL THE SONGS EVERY SONG IS DRIPPING WITH PASSION AND CONVICTION AND RAGE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE OCCASIONAL GANG VOCAL CAME IN I FELT LIKE MARAUDING SOMEWHERE UNTIL LOOKING IT UP JUST NOW I WASN'T EVEN SURE WHAT THE MEANING OF MARAUD WAS BUT I REALIZE NOW THAT WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING WHAT IT MEANT THE ALBUM INDEED MADE ME FEEL LIKE MARAUDING THE STANDOUT TRACKS IN A PRETTY BIG WAY ARE THE TWO EPICS NAMELY GENESIS TO GENOCIDE AND UNCHAIN THE WOLVES THEY RUN THE GAMUT FROM PRETTY TO UGLY TO RAGE TO SADNESS TO EPIC IN SUCH A NATURAL WAY THAT THEY STUNNED ME I WISH WOULD GO IN MORE OF THE EPIC DIRECTION THAT THEY DO ON THOSE SONGS MORE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I CONNECT WITH THEIR SONGS THE MOST THE SHRIEKS ALONG WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GUITAR MELODIES NEAR THE END OF GENESIS TO GENOCIDE HAD ME WISHING THE SONG WOULD NEVER END THE SHORTER THRASHER ANGRIER SONGS ARE GOOD BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THEM FEELS I DON T KNOW I JUST DON'T FIND MYSELF BEING AFFECTED BY THEM THE SAME WAY AS THE LONGER SONGS I'M GOING TO GIVE THIS ONE SEVERAL MORE SPINS THOUGH BECAUSE I FIND MYSELF LIKING COLD STEEL MORE AND MORE EVERY TIME I LISTEN TO IT AND I LIKED THIS ONE UPON FIRST LISTEN MORE THAN I DID THAT ONE THE WOLVES HAVE BEEN UNCHAINED AND I'M READY FOR THEM TO DEVOUR ME

DEATHSPELL OMEGA THE SYNARCHY OF MOLTEN BONES
I STILL CAN'T QUITE WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THIS ONE LIKE MOST DEATHSPELL OMEGA RECORDS EVEN AFTER SEVERAL LISTENS HOWEVER HERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS I HAVE IDENTIFIED IN MY FIRST FEW LISTENS IT SOUNDS LIKE DSO 2 IF YOU LIKE DSO YOU WILL LIKE THIS IF YOU DON'T LIKE DSO THIS ALBUM WILL PROBABLY NOT CHANGE YOUR MIND IT FUCKING RULES STARTING AND ENDING WITH APOCALYPTIC HORNS THIS ALBUM FITTINGLY SOUNDS LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD IF YOU'VE HEARD DSO BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS COMPLEXITY AN INHUMAN DRUMMER OR DRUM MACHINE WHICH WOULD MAKE THE INHUMAN PART MAKE SENSE A MEATY BUZZING BASS PRESENCE WHIPLASH PRODUCING RIFFS AND A LARGE HEAPING OF DISSONANCE OH AND SATAN VOCALS ARE ALTERNATELY SCREAMED GRUNTED AND SHOUTED AS WE HEAR A MAN WHO SEEMS TO BE LOSING HIS MIND TO IMPART COSMIC KNOWLEDGE UPON US EVERY SONG HAS SOMETHING AWESOME ON IT FROM THE SUBDUED GUITARS AND FRANTIC BLASTS THAT END FAMISHED FOR BREATH TO THE BRILLIANT DRUM AND BASS GROOVE THAT KICKS OFF ONWARD WHERE MOST WITH RAVIN I MAY MEET TO THE SUBTLE CHORALS AND THE AFOREMENTIONED SYMPHONIC ELEMENTS WHAT WE'VE GOT ON OUR HANDS HERE IS ANOTHER MINDFUCK FROM THE MASTERS THIS EP SOUNDS LIKE RATHER THAN TWO STEPS FORWARD OR BACK DSO HAS STEPPED TWO STEPS SIDEWAYS BUT WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY ON THEIR OWN INNOVATIVE AND INCREDIBLE LEFT HAND PATH WHY WOULD WE WANT THEM TO CHANGE THEIR DIRECTION

VEATOR TERMINAL REDUX

AND THE REAPERS FLY IN

SOON THE CLEANSING BEGINS

AND NO LONGER WE CRAWL

BEFORE WE RISE MANY MUST FALL

WOW WHERE DO I EVEN START I'VE BEEN HOLDING OFF THIS ALBUM FOR A LONG TIME NOW SIMPLY BECAUSE I WANTED TO READ THE LYRICS WHILE I WAS LISTENING AND THERE IS NO WAY I COULD DO THAT WHILE DOING SOMETHING ELSE SO I FINALLY FOUND MINUTES OF FREE TIME JUST SAT DOWN OPENED UP THE LYRICS AND PLAYED THIS ALBUM AND I FREAKING LOVED IT IT IS JUST AN ADVENTURE LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM I'M NOT TOO INTO THRASH I ONLY LIKE THE BIGGER BANDS AND A COUPLE MODERN BANDS SO THIS REALLY ISN'T MY CUP OF TEA BUT HERE WE GO THE OPENING TRACK REALLY SETS YOU UP BOTH MUSICALLY AND NARRATIVELY AND IT GIVES YOU A GREAT IDEA FOR WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR EVERY SONG HAS SOME THEME OR DYNAMIC THAT DIFFERENTIATES IT FROM THE REST OF THE ALBUM FOR EXAMPLE THE SECOND TRACK CYGNUS TERMINAL IS A VERY SOMBER SONG AND YOU CAN TELL JUST BY THE VOCAL DELIVERY AND THE SLOWER OVERALL TEMPO FROM THE PREVIOUS SONG STILL TEMPO IS VERY FAST AND BY THE END OF THE SECOND TRACK THERE'S THIS FEELING OF TRIUMPH WHEN DAVID DISANTO SCREECHES I HAVE ARRIVED LIKE THE RISE OF A MASSIVE TIDE HOW THE GUITARS AND DRUMS AMPLIFY THAT FEELING OR HOW IN THE SAME SONG WHEN OUR PROTAGONIST RETURNS FROM HIS EXILE DISCANTS SINGS I CROSSED THE GREAT DIVIDE I NOW HAVE COMMAND OVER TIME LYRICALLY YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE PROUD FOR THE PROTAGONIST BUT MUSICALLY THE INSTRUMENTS DO A GOOD JOB IN KEEPING THE SAME SOMBER TONE WHICH KIND OF FORESHADOWS THE EVENTS TO COME IT'S THOSE LITTLE TRANSITIONS THAT I ADORE AND VEATOR COMPLETELY ACES THEIR TRANSITIONS NOW LYRICALLY THIS ALBUM IS ALREADY AMAZING WITH MANY VERSE THAT CAN MEAN MANY THINGS BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE ALBUM FOR WHAT IT IS THEN YOU SHOULD READ THE LYRICS WHILE LISTENING THERE IS A STORY IN THIS ALBUM AND IT'S A GOOD ONE I WON'T GET INTO IT MUCH BECAUSE THE ENDING IS STILL CONFUSING TO ME BUT I'M SURE I'LL UNDERSTAND IT ONE DAY VOCALLY DISCANTS IS PRETTY HARD TO ADJUST TO BUT AFTER HEARING THIS ALBUM I ASKED MYSELF IF I COULD IMAGINE ANY OTHER TYPE OF VOCALS WITH THIS ALBUM AND I JUST COULDN'T THE SCREECHING VOCAL DELIVERY REALLY FITS THE ALBUM STYLISTICALLY IN THAT IT GIVES YOU A SINISTER FEEL NOW AS FOR THE RECORD INSTRUMENTALLY YOU JUST NEED TO LISTEN TO A FEW MINUTES FROM THE FIRST TRACK TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR ARE SOME VERY COMPLEX RIFFS AWESOME BASS LINES AND SOME THUNDERING DRUM WORK VEATOR REALLY UTILIZES BOTH GUITARISTS VERY WELL WORKING EACH ONE TO THEIR LIMIT THE BASS IS ALSO GREAT IN THAT SOMETIMES IT'S AN ENTITY OF ITS OWN IT DOESN'T REALLY FOLLOW THE DRUMS OR THE GUITARS THE DRUMS ARE JUST AMAZING THE DRUM FILLS IN THIS THING AND THE DOUBLE BASS DRUMS WORK IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY ALL IN ALL LISTEN TO THIS IT'S NOT THE GENRE DEFINING ALBUM DO THE DECADE SOME ARE CALLING IT BUT IT DEFINITELY IS ONE OF THE BETTER ALBUMS IN RECENT MEMORY IF YOU LIKE THE TECHNICAL PROG THRASH GENRE GIVE THIS A LISTEN IF YOU'RE NOT TOO INTERESTED IN LYRICS THAN YOU'LL BE FINE LISTENING TO THIS AT YOUR OWN LEISURE

FAVORITE TRACKS I LOVE ALL OF THEM BUT THE STANDOUTS WERE CHARGING THE VOID TRACK CYGNUS TERMINAL TRACK 2 LIQUID CRYSTAL DISEASE TRACK ULTIMATE ARTIFICER TRACK AND PILLARS OF SAND TRACK STEREOPTICON AND PSYCHOTROPIC TRACKS AND ARE KIND OF TRANSITION TRACKS IF THAT MAKES SENSE THEY AREN'T AS EPIC AS THE REST OF THE ALBUM BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY AREN'T GOOD COLLAPSE TRACK IS ULTIMATELY THE CLEAN VOCALS SONG AND I HONESTLY THOUGHT I WOULD HATE IT BUT HEY I ACTUALLY LOVED IT IT'S NOTHING THAT I SEE MYSELF TURNING ON AT ANY MOMENT BUT IT WORKS AS FOR THE LAST SONG IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FINAL RUSH OF ADRENALINE BEFORE THE ULTIMATE EXPLOSION

GORGETS THE EROSION OF SANITY

A BURYING IN DARKNESS YOU WILL HAVE TO BEAR

DEEP YOU'RE DROWNED IN THIS OPTICAL NIGHTMARE

IN VORTEX YOUR VISIONS COLLAPSE INSTANTLY

NOW YOUR LIFE IS CONDEMNED TO OBSCURITY

NOW THIS ONE WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME LAST WHYBLT THREAD AS I WROTE ABOUT GORGETS OBSCURA I WAS TOLD IT WAS A MUCH MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD ALBUM A LOT LESS COMPLEX THAN EXTREMELY COMPLEX NATURE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS IT WAS THE SAME BAND SAME MUSIC JUST TONED DOWN IN COMPLEXITY THAT SAID THIS STILL IS A TECH DEATH RECORD IT STILL HAS ITS OWN COMPLEXITY PERSONALLY I LIKED OBSCURA MORE BUT THIS ONE HAD SOME THINGS OBSCURA DIDN'T FIRST OFF I FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN ALBUM I CAN PLAY ANYTIME BECAUSE OF IT'S LENGTH CLOCKING IN AT A NICE MINUTES AND IT'S MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD NATURE WITH OBSCURA I SOMETIMES FEEL I HAVE TO DEDICATE ALL MY ATTENTION TO LISTENING TO IT BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE SONG BUT WITH THIS ONE THE SPEED WAS GENERALLY A LOT SLOWER THAN IN OBSCURA PLUS THIS ONE'S A LOT EASIER TO HEADBAND TO I DIDN'T MENTION THIS IN MY LAST THREAD BUT THE VOCALS ON THESE TWO ARE AWESOME I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I LOVE THEM I KNOW THAT IN OBSCURA TWO VOCALISTS BUT IN THIS ONE IT'S ONLY ONE LUC LEMAY THE WAY LEMAY DRAGS OUT THE WORDS WORKS WELL WITH THE SLOWER DOUBLE BASS DRUMS AND THE MORE STREAMLINED RIFFS THE BASS WORKS VERY INDEPENDENT IF THAT MAKES SENSE FOR EXAMPLE ON A PATH BEYOND PREMONITION TRACK THERE'S THIS ENTIRE SEGMENT IN THE MIDDLE THAT'S JUST A CHUGGING GUITAR SOUND SIMPLE DRUMS AND A SIMPLE BASS LINE BUT IT'S VERY SINISTER IN HOW IT'S A SUDDEN CHANGE OF PACE MY ONLY PROBLEM ATH THIS ONE MIGHT BE HOW IT SOMETIMES SOUNDS CAMEY AT CERTAIN POINTS BUT IT'S NOT ANYTHING HUGE ALL IN ALL THIS IS A GREAT METAL RECORD IF YOU'RE STILL NEW TO THE GENRE I'D SAY THIS WOULD BE A GREAT START IN THE GENRE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE COMPLEX AND PROGRESSIVE OBSCURA IS THE WAY TO GO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S JUST PURE TECHNICAL DEATH WITHOUT ANY NUISANCES LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE EROSION OF SANITY

FAVORITE TRACKS I DON'T WANT TO CHOOSE ANY BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THIS ALBUM WORKS BEST AS ONE ENTITY NOT AS SEPARATE TRACKS JUST LISTEN TO THE WHOLE THING BUT IF I HAD TO THE FIRST THREE SONGS ARE THE ONES I FIND MYSELF GOING BACK TO THE MOST CONDEMNED TO OBSCURITY 2 BEING MY FAVORITE FROM THOSE THREE

GOEN COGNITIVE

I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TRY

TO BECOME THE ONE

THAT WILL SAVE YOUR HALO

EVERYTHING THAT I DENY

EVERY TIME THAT I LIED

AWARE OF OUR FAILURE

MY COUSIN CAME OVER TO THE REC THREAD IN THIS SUB AND HE ASKED FOR BASSY MUSIC ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS HE GOT WAS COGNITIVE BY GOEN HE LISTENED TO IT AND I LISTENED TO BITS OF IT AND I REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF WOW THAT'S NOT MY TYPE AT ALL ABOUT FOUR MONTHS LATER HERE I AM LISTENING TO THIS THING NONSTOP SO I'LL START WITH VOCALS HERE'S THE BASIC IDEA OF WHAT THE VOCALS SOUND LIKE A BETTER MIKAEL AKERFELDT CLEAN VOCALS AND NO IT'S NOT BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES ARE SWEDISH JOEL EKLÖF HAS A GREAT VOICE THAT WORKS REALLY WELL EVEN WHEN THE SONGS SOMETIMES GET A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN NORMAL THE FUSION BETWEEN HEAVY DRUMMING AND MORE UNCONVENTIONAL BASS PLAYING IS WHAT MAKES THIS ALBUM WHAT IT IS THE GUITARS FOR THE MOST PART TAKE A BACK SEAT TO THE BASS THE GUITARS INSTEAD PROVIDE AN ATMOSPHERE AND BACKGROUND NOISE THE BASS IS THE REAL STAR WITH EACH SONG HAVING A DIFFERENT STYLE OF BASS PLAYING IN FRACTIONS THE BASS GUITARS AND DRUMS SOUND LIKE A PROG ROCK OUTFIT BUT IN DELENDA 2 THE SAME INSTRUMENTS SOUND LIKE A PROG METAL OUTFIT BUT IN OSCILLATION THE SAME INSTRUMENTS SOUND VERY TECH DEATH INSPIRED ULTIMATELY THE ENTIRE ALBUM HAS THE SAME OVERARCHING DYNAMIC THROUGHOUT BUT IT'S THOSE LITTLE CHANGES THAT ARE CHANGES ENOUGH THAT MAKE EVERY SONG ON THIS RECORD DIFFERENT LYRICALLY THIS ALBUM HAS A VERY SOMBER OR SORROWFUL TONE TO IT THE LYRICS ARE VERY CREATIVE AND A LOT OF THE VERSES AREN'T EXACTLY BLACK AND WHITE I FEEL LIKE THIS ALBUM WON'T APPEAL TO EVERYONE AS I CAN IMAGINE SOMEONE CALLING THIS A TOOL KNOCKOFF OR A IT'S JUST A PHASE MOM ALBUM BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT I REALLY LOVED THIS ALBUM I ENJOYED LISTENING IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE SAME DAY I LOOK FORWARD TO LISTENING TELLURIAN NEXT

FAVORITE TRACKS MY FAVORITE IS CANVAS EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT TRACK IS JUST AWESOME THE LYRICS ARE AWESOME HOW THIS SONG GETS HEAVIER WITH EACH VERSE IS FREAKING COOL TO ME I LOVE THE MULTIPLE BUILDUPS THROUGHOUT WHICH LEADS UP TO THE LAST BUILDUP TO AN EPIC ENDING IT'S JUST A SATISFYING SONG SOME OTHER STANDOUTS WERE CAVIA BECAUSE IT'S JUST A CULMINATION OF EVERYTHING AWESOME IN THIS ALBUM FRACTIONS 2 FOR THE MORE GROOVE ORIENTED TONE DELENDA FOR THE SLAP BASS IMPLEMENTED IN THIS ONE PURPOSE FOR THE AWESOME CHORUS AND OVERALL LYRICS CENTERED SONG WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS LISTEN TO THIS



I WROTE A PIECE ABOUT NEWEST ALBUM BUT TO MY BITTER SURPRISE I FOUND OUT THERE'S A CHARACTER LIMIT SINCE WHEN IS THERE A CHARACTER LIMIT I'LL SAVE IT FOR NEXT TIME I GUESS

THANKS FOR READING I ENJOYED DOING THE LAST ONE A LOT AND I ENJOYED DOING THIS ONE TOO I'M GLAD A LOT OF PEOPLE ENJOYED READING MY LAST ONE

ALSO SORRY IF I SEEM INCOMPETENT WHEN I'M DESCRIBING WHAT I LIKE OR DON'T LIKE ABOUT MUSIC I'M NOT REALLY WELL VERSED IN ALL THE TERMINOLOGY AND TERMS USED TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS TECHNIQUE IS OR WHAT THAT SOUND IS AND I'M ALSO SORRY IF MY WRITING ISN'T ALL THAT GOOD ENGLISH ISN'T MY FIRST LANGUAGE BUT WRITING STUFF LIKE THIS ONLY HELPS ME IMPROVE ANY CRITICISMS ON MY WRITING OR REVIEWING SKILLS ARE WELCOME THANKS AGAIN FOR READING

EDIT FIXED FORMATTING
RHAPSODY RHAPSODY OF FIRE I THINK I CAN BEST DESCRIBE THEM AS SYMPHONIC POWER METAL IF YOU'RE A FAN OF POWER METAL THERE'S A LOT TO LOVE HERE BUT THE BAND ALSO HAS MANY SONGS SECTIONS OF SONGS FILLED WITH ORCHESTRAL PIECES WHAT REALLY CAUGHT MY EYE ABOUT THEM THOUGH WAS WHEN I FIGURED OUT THEIR FIRST ALBUMS AS RHAPSODY ARE ACTUALLY ONE CONTINUES STORY THE EMERALD SWORD SAGA I'M A BIG SUCKER FOR AWESOME STORIES IN SONGS WHICH IS WHY THIS PEEKED MY INTEREST
RHAPSODY GARGOYLES ANGELS OF DARKNESS IS A GREAT SONG AND THE LAST IN THE EMERALD SWORD SAGA I THINK IT SHOWCASES ALL OF THE DIFFERENT STYLES THE BAND LIKES TO USE DURING THEIR SONGS WELL

INSOMNIOUS BASICALLY MY FAVORITE BAND OF ALL TIME PURE MELODIC DEATH METAL GOODNESS OVER THE YEARS THEIR SOUND HAS EVOLVED SLIGHTLY AND NOW HAS MOMENTS REMINISCENT OF DOOM METAL AND BLACK METAL MIXED IN WITH THE MELODIC DEATH SOUND THIS YEAR THEY RELEASED THE ALBUM GATE WHICH IS A MIN ONE SONG MASTERPIECE BASED OFF OF A NOVEL BY THE SAME NAME WRITING BY THE VOCALIST THEY WERE INSPIRED BY EDGE OF CRIMSON ALBUMS ALSO MIN ONE SONG ALBUMS WHICH WERE RELEASED SOME YEARS AGO THOUGH IN MY OPINION THIS ONE BLOWS THE INSPIRATION OUT OF THE WATER THE SONG HAS SO MANY AMAZING SECTIONS AND THE GUITARS ESPECIALLY DO NOTHING BUT SPIT OUT COOL RIFF AFTER COOL RIFF I CAN BEST DESCRIBE THIS BAND AS THE GODS OF MELODIC DEATH METAL IN MY OPINION OF COURSE

INSOMNIOUS IN THE GROOVES OF DEATH IS MY SECOND FAVORITE SONG BY THEM ONLY ONE BETTER IS THE NEW GATE SINCE I CAN'T FIND GATE ON YT THIS ONE WILL HAVE TO SUFFICE THOUGH IT'S BEST EXPERIENCED IF YOU LISTEN TO IT AFTER THE REST OF THE ABOVE THE WEEPING WORLD ALBUM LET ME EXPLAIN EVEN THOUGH THE ALBUM IS NOT ONE CONTINUES STORY IT STILL FEELS THAT WAY BECAUSE IT STARTS OUT WITH RAIN THEN THE FIRST SONG BEGINS AND ENDS WITH RAIN IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE TAKEN ON A JOURNEY AND RELEASED FINISH IT WHEN THE LAST SONG ENDS

MORTALS PATH MORTALS PATH

I WILL SAY THE ONLY THING THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GERMAN DEATH METAL DEMO ARE THE SONG TITLES WHICH ARE BONEHEADED AND SOUND LIKE A BREAKDOWN RECORD RATHER THAN A COMPETENT DEATH METAL BAND WHICH EATS RIFFS FOR LUNCH

BLACK CITADEL ANCESTRAL SHADOWS

FANS OF REALLY OBSCURED RAW BLACK METAL PLEASE STEP THIS WAY PEOPLE THAT DO NOT LIKE RAW BLACK METAL PLEASE GO THROUGH THE EXIT HERE TO SAFETY HA IT WAS A TRICK ITS ALL RAW BLACK METAL AND SPIDERS THAT FALL FROM THE CEILING

YEP HEARD IT SPIT OUT THE BONE AND THE TITLE TRACK ARE THE SOLID THRASH ONES ATLAS RISE AND MOTH INTO FLAME ARE DECENT THEY HAVE ANOTHER ONE ABOUT CTHULHU WHICH WAS PRETTY COOL BUT I'VE NEVER EVER BEEN A BIG METALLICA FAN THE MOST OF I CAN EVER SAY ABOUT THEM IS THAT I DIG SOME OF THEIR TUNES AND THIS IS THE FIRST ALBUM I CAN SAY THAT ABOUT SINCE AFA SO GOOD ON THEM

AMAR ANTHE MAXIMALISM

THIS SHIT IS AWFUL I LOVE IT HONESTLY ITS NOT EVEN METAL IT'S EUROPOP TRANCE POP WITH HEAVY GUITARS BUT SOME OF THE TUNES ARE PRETTY DAMN CATCHY LIKE IF YOU CAN ENJOY SIA OR RHIANNA BUT WANT SOME GUITARS BUT IN FAIRNESS THE CLOSING BALLAD TRACK ENDLESSLY IS FUCKING MOVING AS SHIT

WARDRUNA RAGNAROK

OH MAN HAVE I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS YGGDRASIL IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE ALBUMS THIS ONE DEFINITELY LIVES UP TO THE NAME THE WAR DRUMS AND HORN THROUGHOUT IS DEFINITELY MORE APOCALYPTIC THE CHILDRENS CHOIR IS HIT AND MISS AND THE CLOSING TRACK SOUNDS LIKE THE END OF THE MOTHERFUCKING WORLD

AAAL NATHRAKH THE WHOLE OF THE LAW

I FEEL LIKE THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS ARE SOMEWHAT INTERCHANGEABLE BUT WITH AMANITAS BEING THE MOST SOLID THIS IS CONTINUING MUCH IN THE SAME BUT THE PRODUCTION IS A LITTLE MORE BLACK METAL A LITTLE LESS PUNCHY A LITTLE MORE FUZZY I DIG IT BUT NEED MORE TIME WITH IT DEFINITELY SOME KILLER TRACKS ON IT AUDIO SPACE HORROR MORE IN THE VEIN OF EVENT HORIZON THAN MORE EXISTENTIAL FEAR OF THE VAST EMPTY PURPOSELESSNESS OF SPACE

WATT SUN WIDER THAN THE SKY

THE SOFTER STYLE TOTALLY WORKS FOR THEM BUT I DONT FEEL THERE ARE MANY TRACKS UP THE THE QUALITY OF RESTLESS WHICH ITSELF HAS A LIVE ACOUSTIC VERSION WHICH BRINGS A TEAR TO THE EYE

ALSO ASBEN AND THE WITCH WHICH IS SOME PRETTY FUCKING MOURNFUL FEMALE FRONTED DOOM ROCK

ANTAEUS CONDEMNATION IT'S CRAZY TO IMAGINE THAT BARELY A MONTH AGO THE NOTION OF A NEW ANTAEUS ALBUM WAS SIMPLE AND WITHOUT MUCH WARNING THE BOMB DROPPED DESPITE MY POTENTIAL RESERVATIONS THIS ALBUM HAS LIVED UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS CONDEMNATION BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN THE FIRST TWO ANTAEUS RECORDS AND BLOOD LIBELS WHICH HAD THE CLEANEST PRODUCTION IMAGINABLE FOR AN ORTHODOX BM RECORD ANTAEUS DELIVERS WHAT THEY DO BEST RAW VISCERAL AND RELENTLESS BLACK METAL EVERYTHING THAT ANTAEUS IS HERE THE VIOLENT DRUMMING THE DARK ATMOSPHERE WITH DISSONANCE BIT OF AGOROTH INFLUENCE THROWN IN AND VOCALS IF YOU'RE TIRED OF ATMOSPHERIC BM AND NEED SOMETHING MORE AGGRESSIVE GIVE THIS A SPIN

GRIFFIN FLIGHT OF THE GRIFFIN ONE OF THOSE UNDERRATED USP BANDS THAT NEVER WENT ANYWHERE GRIFFIN TAKE THE LESS REFINED MORE BLUE COLLAR USP APPROACH TO THE GENRE THINK OMEN MEDIEVAL STEEL AND ATTACKER TO NAME A FEW IRON MAIDEN LEADS GREAT SOLO WORK AND SOARING VOCALS BASICALLY EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN A GOOD USP RECORD

OMEN BATTLE CRY PRETTY MUCH THE BLUEPRINT FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS GOOD ABOUT BLUE COLLAR USP A RECORD SO OVERFLOWING WITH ENERGY AND GOOD VIBES THAT IT TRANSPORTS YOU TO THE FANTASY WORLD OF WARRIORS AND MAGIC SUNG BY THE UNIQUE VOCALS OF J D KIMBALL I THINK NO MORE NEEDS TO BE SAID

SU TA GAR JAOITZE BASALIA POSSIBLY THE MOST FAMOUS BASQUE METAL BAND SU TA DEBUT IS BASICALLY AN HOMAGE TO THE EARLY NWOBHM SCENE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF THRASH THROWN IN AS THERE AS MANY MOMENTS OF SHAMELESSLY LIFTING RIFFS FROM THE FIRST TWO MAIDEN ALBUMS AND THE ODD METALLICA ONE TO SPICE THINGS UP IN SPITE OF THE IMITATION GAME SU TA GAR PROVIDE A VERY FRESH TAKE ON IT AND STILL MANAGE TO CRAFT ONE OF THE BEST TRAD SPEED METAL RECORDS OF THE EARLY
DEATHSPELL OMEGA DROUGHT BEEN REMOISTENING TO THIS ONE IT'S PRETTY AMAZING I DON'T USUALLY LIKE BLACK METAL BUT DSO IS SOMETHING ELSE AND FOR SOME REASON I ALWAYS PICK UP TRACES OF SONIC YOUTH IN THEIR SOUND

METALLICA STREET ANGER I NEVER PROPERLY LISTENED TO THIS ONE BEFORE SO I THOUGHT WHAT THE HELL AND GAVE IT A CHANCE I ACTUALLY LIKE IT IT'S NOT PERFECT SOME SONGS WORK BETTER THAN OTHERS MOST SONGS COULD HAVE BEEN TRIMMED OUT BUT IT HAS AN UNIQUE SOUND WHICH I HIGHLY APPRECIATE AND THERE IS A SENSE OF ACTUAL ANGER A SENSE OF URGENCY THAT COMES OUT IN EVERY ONE OF THESE SONGS NO MATTER HOW FLAWED THEY ARE THE UNNAMED FEELING IS IMHO ONE OF BEST SONGS

ENSLAVED THE SLEEPING GODS THORN THESE ARE ACTUALLY TWO EPS JOINED TOGETHER IN A COMP ALBUM IT'S STILL KINDA SHORT BUT I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING LISTENING BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY VARIED YOU HAVE AN ELECTRONIC TRANCE TRACK A BLACK PUNK TRACK AND A FEW OTHER SURPRISES
DEMON BITCH HELLFRIENDS

U HIGHWAYCORSAIR I'M ON THE HYPE TRAIN FOR THIS ALBUM NOW AS WELL THIS IS KILLER HEAVY METAL WAY BETTER THAN ETERNAL CHAMPION AND THE ETERNAL CHAMPION ALBUM IS PRETTY DAMN GOOD THE VOCALS ARE THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS ALBUM FOR ME AND I ALSO LOVE THE RAW PRODUCTION THAT YOU DON'T HEAR TOO OFTEN FOR MODERN TRADITION

HIEROPHANT MASS GRAVE

EXTREMELY SURPRISED BY HOW GOOD THIS WAS I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THEIR SECOND ALBUM BENNE BUT FELT IT FELL A BIT SHORT THIS ALBUM DOES NOT FALL SHORT IT IS SOME OF THE MOST BLISTERING BLACK GRIND HARDCORE I'VE HEARD SINCE ONE OF THE ALBUMS THEY EVEN INCORPORATE SOME ASPHYXY ESQUE DOOM PARTS ON HERE AS WELL THIS'LL BE HIGH ON MY LIST AT THE END OF THE YEAR

GRIDDLING LONGHENA

BIT LATE ON REALLY LISTENING TO GRIDDLING BUT FUUUUUUCK IS THIS GOOD THEY SOUND LIKE A MORE TECHNICAL DISCORDANCE AXIS AND I MEAN WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASK FOR REALLY FOR FANS OF FUCKING RIFFS AND BLASTS

USKUMGALLU ROTTEN LIMBS IN DREAMS OF BLOOD
ALBUM

THIS IS MY BLACK ALBUM OF THE YEAR PURE DEPRESSION AND ANGUISH AND FILTH AS IS EXPECTED FROM A VRASUBATLAT BAND THE GUITAR WORK ON THIS IS AMAZING AS IS EVERY OTHER INSTRUMENTATION ON HERE SOME NICE DSM MOMENTS ON HERE AS WELL THAT ARE REMINISCENT OF LEVIATHAN LOVE IT
HYMERA NO MERCY HERE IS SOME AND REALLY MELODIC HEAVY METAL FROM GERMANY LOTS OF THE RIFFS AND VOCAL LINES ARE WRITTEN IN MAJOR TONALITIES SO THAT THE WHOLE PACKAGE HAS A STRONG GLAM VIBE EVEN INCLUDING THE OBLIGATORY SACCHARINE BALLAD HELL WITH THEIR SILLY CLOTHES YOU'D THINK THEY WERE PART OF THE AMERICAN SCENE BARELY MEMORABLE AFTER A COUPLE LISTENS BUT STILL IT HAS SOME DECENT SPOTS WITH A FEW CATCHY HOOKS CHECK OUT KILLER FOR THEIR BEST RIFFS BUT DON'T EXPECT GREATNESS FROM THIS ALBUM

NIGHTMARE MINDLESS MAYHEM HERE IS A SOME MILDLY THRASH HEAVY METAL FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE THE VOCALS ARE GRITTY AND LOUD AND THE RHYTHM SECTION BOUNCES AROUND ERRATICALLY WITH ITS SUPER SHORT SONGS AND SIMPLISTIC RIFFS YEAH IT'S HEAVY AND HARD-HITTING BUT IT WASN'T NOT A SUPER ENGAGING ALBUM TO ME AT ALL NOTE THAT THIS MAY BE BECAUSE I DESPISE PUNK MUSIC AND THIS JUST REMINDED ME TOO MUCH OF THE PUNK I'VE TRIED TO LISTEN TO LONG STORY SHORT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HEAVY METAL BUT YOU ALSO HAPPEN TO LIKE PUNK DON'T LISTEN TO ME THIS ALBUM MAY BE FANTASTIC BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT HEAVY METAL JUST MOVE ALONG THIS ISN'T THE BAND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

KARISA SWEET REVENGE THIS IS SOME PRETTY EARLY BRAZILIAN HEAVY METAL IT'S AND ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES AND THE VOCALS AREN'T VERY GOOD BUT THEY DO FIT THE MUSIC THE VOCALIST IS LIKE A METAL VERSION OF BOB DYLAN NO TRAINING WHATSOEVER BUT HE STILL MANAGES TO PULL IT OFFICIAL THIS IS FAST STUFF WITH SOME OF THE SONGS BORDERING ON SPEED METAL AND THE PRODUCTION IS THICK AND DENSE BUT WITHOUT BEING OVERLY BUSY I FEEL LIKE THIS ALBUM COULD EASILY GROW ON ME IF I PUT THE TIME AND ENERGY INTO DELVING INTO IT MORE DEEPLY BUT FOR SOME REASON IT JUST DIDN'T DRAW ME VERY MUCH AFTER SEVERAL SPINS THE CLOSING TRACK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS ALBUM DELIVERS HERE IS A PRETTY COOL VIDEO OF IT

KAOS TOTAL KAOS THIS LITTLE THING FROM CANADA IS BARELY OVER TWENTY MINUTES LONG AND THE FIRST TRACK ISN'T EVEN SPENT ON ACTUAL MUSIC AS IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF WEIRD SYNTHS AND A BARELY INTELLIGIBLE VOICEOVER ONCE THE MUSIC ACTUALLY STARTS YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN FOR A REAL EIGHTIES TREATISE BUT NO NOT THE EIGHTIES THAT GAVE US THE GREATEST HEAVY METAL IN THE WORLD BUT THOSE OTHER EIGHTIES YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT GAVE US BLONDIE EAST G DAILY AND THE PET SHOP BOYS NOTHING AGAINST ANY OF THOSE ARTISTS AS I LIKE ALL OF THEM BUT JUST KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE EXPECTING SOME CLASSIC EIGHTIES METAL HERE IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY MIXED BAG WITH A DEBBIE HARRY CLONE ON VOCALS THE AFORETOLINKED INSTRUMENTAL IS INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE STRONGEST TRACK AND TO BE FAIR THE CLOSING BALLAD ISN'T BAD EITHER BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT THIS REALLY DESERVES MUCH ATTENTION



WHAT A WEIRD SET OF PICKS FOR THIS WEEK I FEEL LIKE I COULD GET BEHIND KARISA THE MOST BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE MAYBE THERE IS A DEPTH TO THAT ALBUM THAT I JUST HAVEN'T TAPPED INTO YET HYMERA DEFINITELY HAVE THEIR MOMENTS AS WELL BUT THE ALBUM ISN'T CONSISTENT ENOUGH TO TELL SOMEBODY THAT IT'S WORTH TRACKING DOWN KAOS IS MOST CERTAINLY SKIPPABLE AT BEST AND NIGHTMARE JUST DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ENGAGE ME SO I'M SORRY IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THIS POST HOPING FOR A DECENT K BAND BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET ONE FOR THIS DRAW STAY TUNED NEXT TIME FOR L AND CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND HOPE THAT I'LL FIND SOMETHING AS STRONG AS LEATHER NUNN
KRIEGSMASCHINE ENEMY OF MAN

SINISTRA SEMENCE

PLODDING DOOM WITH SURPRISINGLY UPLIFTING VOCALS TO ACCOMPANY IT HEARD ABOUT THEM THROUGH FRIENDS SAYING THEIR DAMNATION SET WAS GREAT AND WILL HOPEFULLY CATCH THEM ON THE ALCES MONO TOUR KINDA REMINDS ME OF MAMMOTH WEED WIZARD BASTARD SOMETIMES BUT WITH LESS FUZZ AND MORE BROODING

FLUISTERAARS LUITE

KHEMMIS HUNTED

I'M NOT TYPICALLY ONE TO LET BUZZ IT'S ALL RELATIVE STOP ME FROM LISTENING TO SOMETHING BUT FOR SOME REASON I HADN'T GOT AROUND TO HEARING THIS YET AND IT FEELS LIKE THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON THANKFULLY IT'S PRETTY GREAT WITH WINDING RIFFS AND MELODIES LIKE ELDER WHILST STILL AFFORDING SPACE TO SOME OF THE MORE BOOMY MOMENTS THAT THE AFOREMENTIONED SEEMS TO SKIP OVER REMINDS ME OCCASIONALLY OF ANCIENTS WHICH IS NEVER A BAD THING

I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE ALBUMS AT THE TOP IN BANDCAMP AND SO FAR HAVE RARELY BEEN DISAPPOINTED THIS ONE REMINDS ME A BIT OF IN THE NIGHT SIDE ECLIPSE AND IS PRETTY WELL WRITTEN IMO THE RIFFS ARE SPECTACULAR AND THE SYNTHS LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND ARE JUST AWESOME AND MAKE FOR AN AMAZING ATMOSPHERE

MALLEUS STORM OF WITCHCRAFT

PRETTY GOOD HELLHAMMER WORSHIP I WAS MISTAKEN TO CALL IT WAR METAL WHEN I POSTED IT HERE I AM REALLY DIGGING THIS KIND OF MORE PRIMITIVE MUSIC JUST BADASS RIFFS CRUSHING DRUMS AND RAW VOCALS AFTER NEARLY A YEAR OF DELVING INTO ALL KINDS OF MORE EASILY CONSUMABLE METAL INCLUDING THE MORE POLISHED ONES WITH NICE CLEAN PRODUCTION THIS IS A WELCOME CHANGE THINKING ABOUT DIGGING DEEPER INTO THIS KIND OF MUSIC

WRETCH WRETCH

AMAZING TRAD DOOM WITH CRAZY GOOD SONGWRITING REALLY DIGGING THEM

ALBATROSS FEAR FROM THE SKIES

KING DIAMOND INFLUENCED MUSIC AND I THINK THEY NAIL IT WITHOUT SOUNDING DERIVATIVE OR BORING GREAT SONGWRITING WITH CHEESY LIGHTHEARTED HORROR THEMED LYRICS

HEATHEN BEAST RISE OF THE SAFFRON EMPIRE

MY FAVOURITE BAND FROM INDIA RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE REALLY GOOD LYRICS AND THEIR INCLUSION OF TRADITIONAL INSTRUMENTS IS PRETTY SPOT ON WITHOUT EVER GETTING OUT OF PLACE OR WEIRD MY FAVOURITE PART OF THEM ARE STILL THE LYRICS I HAVE POSTED THEM HERE A COUPLE OF TIMES

VOID AMNIA DYING LIGHT

ANOTHER CURRENT I FOUND THROUGH BANDCAMP I LIKE THIS KIND OF BLACK METAL WELL PRODUCED KIND OF CLEAN SOUNDING AND BUILDS UP A GREAT ATMOSPHERE IMO THIS IS THE KIND OF MUSIC THAT YOU CAN PLAY IN THE BACKGROUND WHILE STUDYING IT DOESN'T DISTURB YOU NOR DOES IT JUST FADE INTO THE BACKGROUND

IN AN UNRELATED NOTE I AM CONTINUING MY MARATHON OF LISTENING TO COMPLETE DISCOGRAPHIES I STARTED AROUND A MONTH AND HALF AGO I TRY TO LISTEN TO AS MUCH STUFF AS I CAN

LED ZEPPELIN

DEATH

THE WHO

KING CRIMSON

CARAVAN VAN DE GRAFF GENERATOR MORE PROG STUFF

BURTRUM AND THEIR CONTEMPORARIES NOT THEIR COMPLETE DISCOGRAPHIES BUT I THINK I HAVE COVERED THEIR ESSENTIALS

GENESIS

CREDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL

BATORY

IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS I WOULD LOVE TO TRY THEM OUT
I REALLY NEED TO STOP PROCRASTINATING AND LISTEN TO CHASE ALBUMS MORE AND ACTUALLY GET CHASE WRITTEN BEFORE THE SAME DAY I HAVE TO GET CHASE OUT


MY DYING BRIDE

BEEN REMOISTENING TO THEIR ALBUMS I STILL LOVE THEM BUT MY OPINIONS ON SOME OF THEIR ALBUMS HAVE CHANGED I NOW LOVE COMPLETE AND I'VE WARMED UP ON LIKE GODS OF THE SUN AND I FINALLY GOT AROUND TO LISTENING TO THE TWO ALBUMS BY THEM I HADN'T GOTTEN AROUND LISTENING TO BEFORE WHICH ARE FOR LIES I SIRE AND A MAP OF ALL OUR FAILURES MY THOUGHTS ON THEM IS THAT LIES I SIRE IS THEIR WEAKEST ALBUM BUT IT'S STILL REALLY GOOD AND A MAP OF ALL OUR FAILURES IS GREAT BUT I FEEL MISERY IS A BETTER ALBUM


VOIVOD VOIVOD

I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WITH THIS ALBUM I MEAN I LOVE VOIVOD BUT I'VE HEARD NOT SO POSITIVE THINGS ABOUT THIS ALBUM AND THE REST OF THE JASON NEWSTAND ERA AND THIS ALBUM IN CRATICULAR IS THE LOWEST RATED ONE ON WHILE ON RPM IT'S THE OPPOSITE BUT LET'S JUST SAY I LIKED IT BUT IT ISN'T REALLY MEMORABLE BESIDES THE CLOSING TRACK WE CARRY ON


THEATRE OF TRAGEDY MYSTIQUE ASSEMBLY

THE ONLY THEATRE OF TRAGEDY ALBUM I LISTENED TO BEFORE CHASE TWO ALBUMS WAS AEGIS WHICH I FUCKING LOVE I WENT INTO ASSEMBLY FIRST SINCE IT WAS THE SHORTER ONE EXPECTING AN ANOTHER GOTH METAL BAND ADDING INDUSTRIAL METAL ELEMENTS TO THEIR MUSIC LIKE SEPTIC FLESH AND MY DYING BRIDE DID WITH REVOLUTION DNA AND COMPLETE REPRESCITIVLY WHAT I WASN'T EXPECTING THOUGH WAS AN ELECTROPOP ALBUM AND I FUCKING HATE POP MUSIC BUT THIS ALBUM WASN'T SO TERRIBLE JUST BORING DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH ELSE TO SAY ABOUT IT EXCEPT THAT I KINDA LIKED THE OPENER AUTOMATIC LOVER

NOW ON TO MYSTIQUE WHICH IS MORE CLOSER TO INDUSTRIAL ROCK METAL I PREFER THIS ALBUM OVER ASSEMBLY BECAUSE I LIKED A FEW TRACKS ON THIS MAINLY FRAGMENT AND CRASH CONCRETE BUT BESIDES THOSE TWO TRACKS THE WHOLE ALBUM ISN'T GOOD NOR BAD JUST BORING



ARK BURN THE SUN THIS IS AN OLD FAVORITE I'VE REVISITED RECENTLY PROGRESSIVE POWER METAL ROCK FEATURING JORIN LANDE MASTERPLAN BEYOND TWILIGHT BJORN ON VOCALS AS WELL AS OTHER WELL ACCOMPLISHED MUSICIANS IN JOHN MACALUSO TORE GATSBY RANDY COVEN AND MATS OLAUSSON SADLY RANDY AND MATS HAVE SINCE PASSED AWAY BUT THIS ALBUM IS A TESTAMENT TO THEIR ABILITY AS SONGWRITERS FRETLESS BASS WORK IN PARTICULAR IS INCREDIBLE GUITAR PLAYING IS ALSO OTHER WORLDLY AND HE IS VERY VERSATILE BEING ABLE TO PLAY MANY STYLES WITH EASE ALSO VOCALS ARE AS USUAL VERY POWERFUL AND EMOTIONAL AND MATS AND JOHN ALSO KILL IT ON THIS ALBUM IF YOU WANT CATCHY SONGS WITH A SHIT LOAD OF TECHNICAL CHOPS JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE THAT DO NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE SONGS AS A WHOLE THEN YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM

A BLACK MOON BROODS OVER LEMURIA THIS IS THE DEBUT ALBUM OF EPIC SYMPHONIC BLACK DEATH METAL MASTERS IF YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS BAND BEFORE AND THINK IT'S TOO OVER THE TOP I RECOMMEND YOU GIVE THIS ALBUM A LISTEN THE KEYBOARDS ARE MUCH MORE SUBDUED AND THIS ALBUM IS MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD ATMOSPHERIC DEATH METAL I PURCHASED THE VINYL REMASTER AND AM EAGERLY AWAITING IT'S ARRIVAL

SIDTH OPACITIES MINI ALBUM FROM THE TECHNICAL METALCORE DENT MASTERS IF YOU'RE INTO BANDS LIKE PERIPHERY YOU MUST CHECK THIS BAND OUT THEY ARE WIDELY INFLUENTIAL ON THE DENT SCENE AND THIS ALBUM IS THEIR LONG AWAITED RETURN AFTER ALMOST A DECADE HIATUS REALLY SONGS WITH CATCHY CHORUSES KILLER BREAKDOWNS TECHNICAL ACROBATICS AND THE TYPICAL SILLY UNDERTONES YOU COME TO EXPECT FROM SIDTH HIGHLY RECOMMENDED LISTEN
CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE ALBUM OFF THE CUFF BUT THE COVER ART IS THE BAND STANDING IN THE WOODS WITH THEIR NAME ACROSS THE TOP WRITTEN IN SPINY LETTERS REALLY GREAT SHIT
FOR EVERYONE IN THIS THREAD WHO ISN'T DOING EBBMAN I'M MAKING A LIST AND I'M CHECKING IT TWICE AND SATANS GOING TO FIND OUT WHO'S TARVE

PERSONALLY I'VE BEEN BEEN LOVING WODENSTHRONE LOSS THIS IS FOLKY SOMEWHAT SYMPHONIC BLACK METAL IF YOU LIKE FEN OR NOCTURNAL MORTEM GIVE THIS A GO ITS ALSO SOMEWHAT BITTERSWEET AS THEY'VE SPLIT UP THIS YEAR

WODENSTHRONE LOSS
SENTENTIA DARKNESS TRANSCEND


A VERY IMPRESSIVE PIECE OF DISSONANT TECHNICAL DEATH METAL PEPPERED WITH SOME BM INFLUENCES THOUGH I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE PRODUCTION THIS ALBUM IS A THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE A LOT OF ULCERATE INFLUENCES HERE BUT THE RECORD DEFINITELY STILL STANDS ON ITS OWN
AETERNAM MOON-GOD

AETERNAM IS A SMALL BAND FROM CANADA TAKING INSPIRATION FROM BOTH ARABIC AND MAYAN GODS AND HISTORY WITH SONGS SUCH AS INVADING JERUSALEM OR RISE OF ARABIA THEY SHOW IMPORTANT EVENTS IN THE LIKE THE RELIGIOUS CRUSADES WHILE SONGS SUCH AS XIBALBA EXPLORE INTERESTING ASPECTS FROM THE SOUTH AMERICAN HISTORY THE MUSIC IS MOSTLY INFLUENCED BY ARABIC ELEMENTS THE MELODIC AND THRASH SOUND IS COMPLEMENTED WITH AMBIENT ORCHESTRATIONS THE LOW AND RAW HARSH VOCALS ARE CONTRASTING WITH THE ACOUSTIC GUITAR PARTS AND THE USE OF CLEAN VOCALS THE CONCEPT AROUND THE MUSIC IS CLEAR AND ORIGINAL THE DRUM BEATS MAKE YOUR HEAD MOVE THE RIFFS ARE CLEAR THE PRODUCTION IS GREAT YOU CAN OFTEN HEAR LEAD HARMONIES THE BASS IS ROARING WHEN IT NEEDS TO SOME PARTS USE HAND DRUMMING TO SOUND MORE TRADITIONAL THE SECOND ALBUM MOON-GOD HAS HUGE ORCHESTRATIONS WHILE THE FIRST ONE DISCIPLES OF THE UNSEEN IS CLOSER TO PLAIN MELODIC DEATH METAL I LOVE BOTH ALBUMS AND RECOMMEND BOTH


VESSELS

IS A GROWING BAND ROCKING FROM AUSTRALIA THEIR MUSIC IS VERY HARD TO DESCRIBE THE LEAST I COULD SAY IS IT IS A VERY UNIQUE MIX OF MELODIC DEATH METAL AND PROGRESSIVE METAL SIMPLY PUT IT'S A CROSSOVER OF JAPETH AND INSOMNIOUS VESSELS IS THEIR FOURTH ALBUM AND CAME OUT EARLIER THIS YEAR THE VOCALS ARE VERY RAW AND LOW THE GUITAR TONE IS INCREDIBLE AND THE MUSIC IS VERY HEAVY WHILE STILL BEING MELODIC THE RIFFS DO NOT SOUND LIKE THE GENERIC DEATH METAL RIFFS YOU HEAR ON EVERY OTHER ALBUMS THE RHYTHM SECTION IS ON POINT THE BASS IS SUPER CLEAR WHILE THE DRUMS POUND THE TEMPO INTO YOUR HEAD THE THEMATIC OF THE ALBUM REVOLVES AROUND LIFE AND DEATH NATURE AND PHILOSOPHY PROBABLY ALBUM OF THE YEAR FOR ME


OTHER THAN THAT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WELL KNOWN ARTISTS WHO DON'T NEED ANY DESCRIPTION SUCH AS INSOMNIOUS ENSIFERUM OR WINTERSUN
DECAPITATED WINDS OF CREATION

POLISH TECHNICAL DEATH METAL BAND DEBUT ALBUM RELEASED IN IS AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC IN MY BOOK I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW SIMPLY BECAUSE OF HOW SUPREMELY WELL CRAFTED IT IS WINDS OF CREATION DOESN'T REALLY BRING ANYTHING NEW TO THE TABLE BUT IT REARRANGES ALL THE PARTS THAT WERE ALREADY THERE INTO A GLORIOUS MASTERCRAFT OF BRUTAL TECHNICAL MELODIC AND CATCHY AS FUCK DEATH METAL ALBUM THAT ANY METAL FAN IN THEIR RIGHT MIND JUST HAS TO LISTEN TO AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFE EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON THIS ALBUM MEANING THE BAND MEMBERS ARE INCREDIBLE MUSICIANS WELL SARON THE VOCALIST IS A BIT IF YOU WILL BUT HIS GUTTURAL ROARS FIT THE TONE ALL TOO WELL REALLY EMPHASISING THE PUNCH IN THE GUT THAT IS THIS RIFFULAR TALENT HOLY SHIT THE RIFFS ON THIS ALBUM THEY'RE ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLY HEADBANGABLE IN PLACES TAKE THE MAIN RIFF FROM THE EYE OF HORUS FOR INSTANCE A FRANTIC UP AND DOWN TREMOLO MOTION ON THE GUITAR THAT JUST SOUNDS BADASS FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD OR THE MAIN RIFF AGAIN FROM THE TITLE TRACK WINDS OF CREATION WHICH IS JUST SO ENERGETIC AND FUCKING METAL LOOK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE HOW AMAZING THIS BAND IS USING EARTHLY ADJECTIVES YOU REALLY NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM YOURSELF KEEP IN MIND WHEN DOING SO THAT THE DRUMMER VITEK WAS AT THE TIME OF RECORDING THIS ALBUM THE GUITARIST MARTIN I BELIEVE WAS THE VOCALIST SARON WAS OR AND THE BASSIST WHO'S NAME ESCAPES ME AT THE MOMENT AND WHO IS BARELY AUDIBLE FOR THE MOST PART WHICH IS A BIT OF A SHORTCOMING OF THIS ALBUM WAS METHINKS KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN LISTENING TO INSANE DOUBLE BASS RIDES OR FRANTIC BLAST BEATS AND PERFECT SOLOS AND EXCELLENTLY EXECUTED HIGHLY TECHNICAL RIFFS
BASICALLY I'M SAYING YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO THIS BAND THEY ARE BRUTALLY HEAVY IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES TECHNICAL AND TRICKY IN ALL THE OTHERS WITH AN EXCELLENT HELPING OF TEENAGE ANGST TO REALLY BRING IT ALL TOGETHER IF I WAS TO RATE THIS ALBUM I'D GIVE IT A OUT OF BUT I THINK NUMBERED RATING SYSTEMS ARE KIND OF POINTLESS SO FUCK IT HAVE A LISTEN TO WINDS OF CREATION AND THANK ME LATER

RECOMMENDED TRACKS THE FIRST DAMNED NINE STEPS THE EYE OF HORUS WINDS OF CREATION DANCE MACABRE
FRAGMENTS OF CREATION SUNBURST

THEY'RE PROGRESSIVE POWER METAL BUT WAIT THEY SOUND NOTHING LIKE SYMPHONY X OR EVEN BLIND GUARDIAN LATER YEARS SO MANY VOCALISTS IN THIS SUBGENRE ANNOY ME WITH THEIR OVERLY HIGH VOICES BUT THIS VOCALIST IS VERY PLEASING TO LISTEN TO HE SOUNDS LIKE A YOUNG ROY KAHN FROM CONCEPTION AND CAMELOT I EVEN LOOKED THEM UP ON YOUTUBE TO SEE HOW GOOD THEY SOUND LIVE AND WAS HIGHLY IMPRESSED

AND UNLIKE OTHER PROG POWER BANDS THEY ARE ACTUALLY FUCKING HEAVY GUS CRAX WHY ARE GREEK GUYS ALWAYS CALLED GUS ON THE GUITAR BANKS ENOUGH TO BE PLEASING AND INTERESTING BUT NOT DREAM THEATER ANNOYING BUT I DO HAVE A FEW COMPLAINTS AND SINCE THEY ARE A RELATIVELY NEW BAND THEY GET A PASSIVE THE DRUMS ARE FLAT THE BASS IS BURIED THE GUITARS ARE CRUNCHY AND DENTY PLEASE DIRTY UP THE PRODUCTION A BIT


WINTERSUN WINTERSUN

HOW THE FUCK WAS I NOT INTO THIS BAND BEFORE MELODIC DEATH POWER METAL DAMN I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO A LOT OF POWER METAL THIS WEEK THERE IS A REASON BUT IT'S KIND OF A SECRET
FINALLY GAVE GHOSTLIGHTS A LISTEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH I'VE LISTENED TO SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL SONGS BEFORE BUT IT WAS MY FIRST FOR A FEW OF THEM ANYWAY PRETTY GOOD ALBUM FEELS MORE OPERATIC THAN STUFF I'VE HEARD FROM THEM BEFORE AND I'M A BIG FAN OF SYMPHONIC METAL SO THAT WORKS NICELY FOR ME ALSO PERHAPS LEANS MORE TOWARDS HARD ROCK ON SOME TRACKS BUT WHATEVER FAVOURITE TRACK WOULD PROBABLY BE LET THE STORM DESCEND UPON YOU HAS A SENSE OF GRAND SCALE TO IT THAT I QUITE LIKE I SHOULD PROBABLY CHECK OUT SOME MORE EDGY

I'VE ALSO HAD DEVIN ADDICTED IN MY ROTATION A LOT LIKE THE SOUND TO ABOUT HALF OF IT NOT AS MUCH OF A FAN OF THE MORE AMBIENT OTHER HALF BUT IZ OKAY I GUESS
CROWBAR THE SERPENT ONLY LIES
I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM PRETTY MUCH NON STOP SINCE FRIDAY I HAD TROUBLE GETTING INTO OLDER CROWBAR WHEN I FIRST STARTED DELVING INTO SLUDGE METAL AND I STEPPED AWAY FROM THEM FOR AWHILE THE FIRST TRACK FALLING WHILE RISING SHOWED UP IN A PLAYLIST ON PONTIFY AND I WAS REALLY INTERESTED STARTED LISTENING TO THE NEWEST ALBUM AND THAT WAS THE SOUND I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THEY REALLY HAD ME HOOKED WITH THE ENEMY BESIDE YOU IF YOU GREW A SET OF BALLS IT JUST MIGHT CHANGE YOUR LIFE I REALLY THINK THIS ALBUM IS FOR ME THE PERFECT EXECUTION OF SLUDGE METAL IT'S DARK GUTTURAL RAW AND HAS ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF BOTH METAL AND HARDCORE PUNK THAT I REALLY LOOK FOR IN ANY BAND

WHORES GOLD
I MEAN FUCK YEAH RIGHT I STARTED LISTENING TO WHORES ABOUT A YEAR AGO BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE I WORKED WITH WERE CLOSE WITH THEM DESIGNED THEIR POSTERS SHIRTS ETC UP UNTIL NOW THEY'VE ONLY HAD LIKE TRACKS OUT AND I'VE LISTENED TO ALL OF THEM AN UNHEALTHY AMOUNT OF TIMES SO WHEN I HEARD THEY WERE RECORDING THEIR FIRST FULL LENGTH ALBUM I WENT A LITTLE CRAZY THEY'VE REALLY DIALED IN THEIR SOUND ON THIS ALBUM I THINK IT'S JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CHAOS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF RESTRAINT SORT OF LIKE A CLENCHED FIST WITH VEINS BURSTING THE ABSOLUTE HIGHLIGHT OF THE ALBUM WAS FINDING OUT THAT THEY BLOODY LIKE THE DAY YOU WERE BORN I THINK I STILL HAVE A SLIGHT ERECTION
SOME NEW RELEASES I'VE BEEN CHECKING OUT

BOLDER HERO

I HAD HIGH HOPES FOR THIS LP BASED OFF THEIR EPS BUT THE QUESTION ALWAYS LINGERED COULD BOLDER CRAFT A SOLID MINUTES OF MUSIC THAT LIVED UP TO THE HYPE OF THEIR SHORTER RELEASES AFTER A FEW LISTENS I HAVE TO SAY THE ANSWER IS A VERY STRONG NUMBER THIS ALBUM BLOWS AND IT'S DUE TO ONE VERY KEY FACTOR THE FOCUS SHIFTED FROM MASSIVE RIFFAGE TO HAVING UNIQUE VOCAL PARTS MOST OF THE SONGS HERE HAVE SOME REALLY AWKWARD CLEAN VOCALS THAT JUST DOESN'T DO IT ANY FAVOURS I HAVE ZERO PROBLEM WITH BANDS EXPERIMENTING WITH THIS STUFF AND IN FACT BOLDER HAS PULLED THIS OFF ON THEIR EPS RATHER WELL HERE THE RIFFS ARE JUST LOST TO MAKE ROOM FOR THESE PARTS THE ONLY TRACK THAT ACTUALLY KICKS MY ASS IS PHOSPHOR SPIRITUAL ATHLETICISM IS ALSO PRETTY COOL THE REST JUST HAVE TOO MANY PARTS THAT ARE UNDERDEVELOPED OR DOWNRIGHT CLINGY IT'S A SHAME TOO BECAUSE THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION ON THIS LP IS GREAT PERHAPS THIS IS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING ALBUM OF THE YEAR

CRYPTS RECANTS OF EXPANSION

CRYPTS DEBUT LP WAS ENJOYABLE BUT IT WASN'T EXACTLY MEMORABLE FOR ME HERE THEY'VE REALLY STEPPED THINGS UP BY OFFERING WELL PENNED SONGS THERE SEEMS TO BE EMPHASIS ON SLOW MID TEMPOS BUT THEY'LL STILL PUSH THEMSELVES TO THE THRESHOLD OF THEIR PLAYING THE PACE AND SPACE TO BORROW A TERM FROM BASKETBALL SEEMS TO HAVE TREATED THEM WELL IT'S CREEPY IT'S EERIE AND IT'S DOWNRIGHT EVIL SOUNDING I DROVE AROUND WITH THIS IN MY CAR THE DAY I RECEIVED IT IN THE MAIL AND EVERYTHING JUST SOUNDS SO MASSIVE DEFINITELY A HUGE IMPROVEMENT ON THEIR PREVIOUS EFFORTS

DEATHSPELL OMEGA THE SYNARCHY OF MOLTEN BONES

DEATHSPELL RETURNS AFTER A YEAR SILENCE TO DELIVER MINUTES OF CHAOS ACROSS SONGS I THOUGHT PARACLETUS WAS AN INCREDIBLE LP WITH THE DROUGHT EP BEING MORE OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT WASN'T REALLY SURE WHAT TO EXPECT FROM DSO BUT THEY CERTAINLY MANAGED TO DELIVER SOMETHING WORTH HEARING I THINK THIS ONE IS A LOT MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN DROUGHT AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT BETTER FOR MY TASTES
VOID KING GO LISTEN TO THEM DO IT DO IT NOW
DIABOLIC NIGHT

POUNDING EVIL BLACK SPEED THAT TICKS ALL THE RIGHT BOXES RUNNING WILD RIFFS ONE OF THE DEMO SONGS MIGHT AS WELL BE CALLED ADRIAN II SON OF SON OF SATAN FLYING V PROMINENT IN BOTH ARTWORK AND BAND PIC COVERING EARLY KAT DAMN GOOD STUFF AND WITH LUCK A FULL-LENGTH WILL BE ON THE HORIZON SOON ENOUGH

UNLEASH THE ABYSS FROM SEPULCHRAL MAGIC EP

INFERNAL POWER FROM INFERNAL POWER



BEOWULF

NOT THE VENICE CROSSOVER BEOWULF BUT THE OTHER SOCAL BEOWULF THE ONE THAT WAS A FEW YEARS EARLY TO THE PARTY

IF RIOT HAD MADE AN ALBUM BETWEEN NARITA AND FIRE DOWN UNDER IT PROBABLY SOUNDED PRETTY CLOSE TO SLICE OF LIFE WHICH CAME OUT DURING THE YEAR BETWEEN THOSE TWO RIOT ALBUMS COME TO THINK OF IT ANYONE KNOW FOR SURE THAT MARK REALE AND GUY SPERANZA DIDN'T HEAD OUT WEST FOR A FEW WEEKS IN SERIOUSLY THOUGH IT'S NOT CLOSE ENOUGH FOR SHITTY FAN THEORIES BUT IF YOU DIG EARLY RIOT THIS ONE SHOULD BE A GIVEN UNLESS A LACK OF BABY HARP SEALS IS A DEALBREAKER I GUESS

THE HOUNDS OF TINDALO FROM SLICE OF LIFE

GETAWAY FROM SLICE OF LIFE



SILENT SCREAM

WITH A NAME PROBABLY CRIBBED FROM SLAYER AND GENE HOGAN IN THE CHAIR IT'S NOT TOO HARD TO GUESS WHAT THEY SOUNDED LIKE GOES WELL WITH EXHORTER DEMOLITION HAMMER IDOLATRY ETC AND HAS A SIMILAR KNACK FOR BLUDGEONING MIDTEMPO PARTS WHICH UNLIKE THE OTHERS THEY CAME DAMN CLOSE TO ON BUT HEY

FROM THE DARKEST DEPTHS OF THE IMAGINATION
FLESHHOOD APOCALYPSE LABYRINTH

I KNOW THIS ALBUM GOT A LOT OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS COMPARED TO THEIR FIRST TWO ALBUMS BUT THIS IS THE ALBUM THAT GOT ME INTO THEM ABOUT A YEAR AGO THE FIRST TIME I HEARD MINOTAUR WRATH OF POSEIDON I KNEW I FOUND A NEW FAVORITE BAND AND GENRE I HADN'T FULLY COMMITTED TO LISTENING TO DEATH METAL YET THE ALBUM AS A WHOLE STILL IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TO ME MY FAVORITE TRACKS BEING KINGHORN MINOTAUR AND EPILOGUE

PANOPTICON AUTUMN ETERNAL

ANOTHER ALBUM FROM THIS DECADE ITS A MASTERPIECE TO ME THAT I HAVE KEPT TOSSING INTO THE MIX OF WHAT I LISTEN TO SINCE IT WAS RELEASED LAST YEAR AS WITH LABYRINTH THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO PANOPTICON AND SINCE THEN I'VE GONE BACK TO LISTEN TO MOST OF HIS WORK ALWAYS ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY BY THE ATMOSPHERE AUSTIN LUNN CAN CREATE THE INSTRUMENTAL GOLD RETURNS NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME WITH HOW MUCH ATMOSPHERE LUNN CAN CREATE THE FOLLOWING INTO THE NORTH WOODS AND AUTUMN ETERNAL ARE TWO HEAVY HITTING SONGS BUT FOR ME THE ALBUM PEAKS WITH THE TRANSITION OF PALE GHOSTS INTO A SUPERIOR IN THE BIBLE LAMENTATIONS FROM REVIEWS OF THE ALBUM I HAVE SEEN A SUPERIOR LAMENT TO BE REVIEWED AS A LOW POINT OF THE ALBUM BUT THE CLEAN VOCALS THAT APPEAR ABOUT FOUR MINUTES INTO THE SONG ALWAYS BLOW ME AWAY

ISIS PANOPTICON

I WAS EXTREMELY LATE TO FINDING THIS ALBUM ONLY LISTENING TO IT FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO WHEN SO DID WE APPEARED ON MY PONTIFY DISCOVER WEEKLY BUT ITS BEEN IN CONSTANTLY ROTATION AS I WALK AROUND CAMPUS TO CLASS SINCE THEN SO DID WE IS A GREAT OPENING TRACK WITH AN AMAZING TRANSITION INTO BACKLIT IN FICTION KEEPS THE PACE OF SOLID TRACKS BUT I PERSONALLY FIND MYSELF ALWAYS SKIPPING TO SYNDIC CALLS I CAN'T PINPOINT THE PART OF THE TRACK THAT HAS ME MESMERIZED BUT IT HAS BEEN A STAPLE FOR ME OVERALL THE ALBUM RUNS ABOUT AN HOUR WITH VERY LITTLE VOCALS WITHIN THE TIME THIS IS FINE THOUGH AS THE MUSIC ITSELF IS THE KEY FOCUS AND NOT THE VOCALS ON THE ALBUM
NOT AS MUCH THIS WEEK I HAVE BEEN A BIT TOO BUSY TO KEEP UP WITH IT ALL

BLACK HOLE LAND OF MYSTERY PROGRESSIVE

PONTIFY

YOUTUBE

A REAL EASY LISTEN VOCALS SOUNDED A LITTLE LIKE ROB HALFORD ON FIRST LISTEN BUT THE MUSIC AND COMPOSITION IS BOTH INTERESTING AND SOOTHING IT S A SHAME THEY ONLY RELEASED 2 FULL LENGTH ALBUMS




AGALLOCH DISCOGRAPHY

PONTIFY

YOUTUBE

ALTHOUGH I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO SEE THEM LIVE INSERT SADNESS HERE I REALLY LOVE THIS BAND AND WAS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES I KNOW THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST BAND BUT THE MUSIC IS RELAXING ENTERTAINING AND VERY WELL COMPOSED THIS IS THAT ONE BAND I CANNOT STOP LISTENING TOO

USKUMGALLU ROTTEN LIMBS IN DREAMS OF BLOOD

THIS IS ACTUALLY A REPOST OF A COMMENT I WROTE YESTERDAY BUT I FIGURED I'D INCLUDE IT HERE TO GO ALONG WITH U PARATE

BASICALLY THE TYPICAL THINGS THAT MAKE BLACK METAL GREAT I LOVE THE RIFFS VOCALS AND FIND THE HAZY PRODUCTION INTERESTING

I'LL USE THE SECOND SONG ROTTEN LIMBS AS REFERENCE IT IS THE SAME RIFF FOR BASICALLY THE WHOLE SONG BUT IT WORKS REALLY WELL I LIKE HOW THEY KEEP BUILDING AROUND THAT RIFF AND THE INTENSITY OF THE SONG INCREASES FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL MINUTES I REALLY LIKE THE BARKING GROWL HE DOES AT THE 2 MIN MARK AND AT OTHER PARTS OF THE ALBUM

I ALSO LOVE HOW LOW SOUNDING THE ONE RIFF IS IN MONOLITH DEMENTIA I THINK IT IS INTERESTING HOW IT IS BURIED IN THE HAZY PRODUCTION AND POUNDING DRUMS GOOD CYMBAL RIDES TOO THE DRUMS CUT OUT AROUND THE MARK FOR A NICE DOOM EFFECT I'M A BIG FAN OF HALF-TIME BREAKS

I HAVE THE ALBUM ON TAPE AND DRIVE AN OLD CAR WITH A TAPE DECK SO THIS IS A PART OF MY REGULAR COMMUTE

OOZING WOUND WHATEVER FOREVER

FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I'D OCCASIONALLY SEE THESE GUYS WRITTEN ABOUT AS SOME KIND OF THRASH REVIVAL OUTFIT IN THE SAME BREATH AS POWER TRIP IRON REAGAN OR MUNICIPAL WASTE I TRIED THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS BUT NOTHING EVER STUCK WITH ME BUT THIS NEW ONE HAS GOT ITS HOOKS IN

I DON'T THINK IT'S THRASH REALLY BUT I'LL LET MORE SEASONED EARS BE THE JUDGE WHAT I DO HEAR IS ELEMENTS OF THRASH COMBINED WITH NOISE ROCK AND EVEN CLASSICAL MINIMALISM DISCORDANT SHORT RIFFS REPEATED AT UNUSUALLY GREAT LENGTH ALMOST LIKE THEY TOOK A PAGE FROM ORTHRELM TAKING A PAGE FROM PHILIP GLASS

ANYWAY IT'S KILLER I ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT IN ADDITION TO CLASSIC GALLOPING RIFFS THERE'S UNUSUAL HARMONIC MOVEMENT KIND OF LIKE A THRASH EQUIVALENT OF MELODEATH EXCEPT THE MELODIC ASPECT ISN'T STUPIDLY CORNY
FYRNASK BORN
ALBUM

BLACK METAL WITH VERY RICH ATMOSPHERE VOCALS AT TIMES KIND OF REMIND ME OF SOLSTAFIR ABOUT HALF OF THE ALBUM IS BM THE REST IS VERY PRIMAL RHYTHMS IT'S TAGGED AS RITUALISTIC BLACK METAL IF THAT HELPS MY WEAK DESCRIPTION AWESOME ARTWORK TOO THAT'S WHAT DREW ME IN TO IT THE VINYL IS ON ITS WAY TO ME AT THIS MOMENT

ANTAR ODE TO THE FLAME

I WAS A MASSIVE FAN OF THE LP BY THESE GUYS SO NATURALLY I WAS HYPED FOR A NEW RELEASE AS EXPECTED THEY CONTINUE PUTTING OUT LOW AGGRESSIVE RIFFS AND RAW VOCALS AS A STRIPPED DOWN 2 PIECE LOTS OF REALLY INTERESTING SONGS AND GOOD COMPOSITIONS THEY HAVE A REAL FEEL OF HOW TO WRITE A SONG THAT HAS VALLEYS AND PEAKS THE ONLY THING I REALLY THINK THEY COULD USE IS GUITAR SOLOS MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT THEIR THING BUT BY THE END OF THE RECORD I FELT LIKE I NEEDED SOMETHING TO BREAK UP THE DOWNTURNED PUMMELING

BLIND GUARDIAN FIRST ALBUMS

I HAVE NEVER REALLY GOTTEN INTO BLIND GUARDIAN EVERYTHING I LISTENED TO SEEMED TO BE OVERLY OPERATIC SYMPHONIC AND JUST KIND OF CORNY LIKE I CAN GET DOWN WITH SOME POWER METAL BUT IT JUST SEEMS UNNECESSARY TO ADD VIOLINS AND ORGANS AND I DUNNO THEIR FIRST THREE ALBUMS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THOUGH IT'S LIKE VERY POLISHED FANTASY SPEED METAL WITH A GREAT VOCALIST AND HAS COMPLETELY BLOWN ME AWAY IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO ISN'T REALLY INTO THEIR NEW STUFF GO LISTEN TO THE FIRST RECORD IT'S LIKE SCANNER AND BATORY HAD A BABY THAT LOVED IND
AVENGED SEVENFOLD THE STAGE
SOME PEOPLE GIVE THE BAND SHIT FOR THE OF IT AND THE FACT THAT THEIR LOGO IS VERY SIMILAR TO SOME WOULD ALSO SAY THEY'RE NOT METAL ENOUGH I WOULD AGREE TO A POINT WITH SOME OF THEIR MATERIAL THE MOST RECENT ALBUM HAS EXCELLENT DRUMWORK AND ENJOYABLE RIFFS THEY ALSO WENT MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH A CONCEPT ALBUM REVOLVING AROUND THINGS LIKE AI NUCLEAR WAR AND SUCH

ANYTHING I FIND BY BIO
RONNIE JAMES BIO IS ABOUT AS METAL AS YOU CAN GET THIS INCLUDES ALL SABBATH SONGS WITH HIM HEAVEN AND HELL BASICALLY SABBATH BIO RAINBOW AND ELF FORMERLY A BEACH BOYS STYLE BAND TITLED RONNIE BIO AND THE RED CAPS

RIDE THE LIGHTNING
I RECENTLY FOUND A COPY OF THIS ALBUM I HAD AND HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THAT FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING

OVERKILL
A FRIEND OF MINE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS BAND RECENTLY AND I'VE HEARD A FEW OF THEIR SONGS ABOUT AS THRASH METAL AS YOU CAN GET WITH ELMO ON VOCALS
SALE FREUD ADIEU VAT

SALE FREUD IS ONE OF THOSE EXTREMELY FRENCH BLACK METAL BANDS WHERE THE VOCALS ARE SO FRENCH THEY GET INTO THAT AREA OF SHRIEKS YOU'LL KNOW IT WHEN YOU HEAR IT IT'S ALSO PRETTY RAW AT TIMES PRETTY UNPOLISHED HOWEVER WHEN THEY HIT A GREAT SONG THEY REALLY DO WELL IDELLE IS DEFINITELY MY FAVOURITE SONG ON THE ALBUM BUT THERE ARE FEW MORE THAT ARE QUITE ENJOYABLE THIS BAND HAS A TON OF PREVIOUS ALBUMS BUT I'VE ONLY HEARD THE TWO RELEASED THIS YEAR

CULETS DES GHOULS COVEN

IS IT SUPER LONG YES IS IT TOO LONG DEPENDS ON HOW LONG YOU LIKE YOUR MUSIC IT'S NOT TOO LONG FOR ME I'VE HAD OTHER ALBUMS THAT WERE TOO LONG THIS ONE IS NOT THE PACING OF THE SONGS AND THE VARIETY EACH SONG HOLDS IS ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN ME THE FULL MINUTE RUN TIME OR WHATEVER IT IS ONCE AGAIN CULETS DES GHOULS MANAGE TO BRING SOME AWESOME RIFFS I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS GUITAR TONE IN OTHER BANDS SO IT SOUNDS REALLY AWESOME AND UNIQUE TO ME MAYBE OTHER BANDS USE THIS AS WELL BUT IF THEY DO I DON'T KNOW THEM QUITE HAPPY WITH THIS ALBUM CHECK IT OUT IF YOU CAN HANDLE ALMOST 2 HOURS OF ONE BAND

CRIPPLED BLACK PHOENIX BRONZE

I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN A BIG FAN OF CB EVER SINCE THEIR SOPHOMORE CAME OUT SO MANY YEARS AGO THE MEGA TRACK TIME OF YER LIFE WAS SONG OF YEAR FOR MY IN SOME OF THEIR OTHER ALBUMS HAVE BEEN HITS SOME HAVE BEEN MISSES I VIGILANTE IS GOOD MANKIND THE CRAFTY APE IS NO GOOD ETC ETC SO WHEN THIS NEW ALBUM WAS MENTIONED ON THAT VERY HANDY SATURDAY THREAD I CHECKED IT OUT IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THEIR GOOD ALBUMS I LIKE THE RIFFS I LIKE THE GUITAR TONE THE VOCALS THOUGH MUTE PAIR VERY NICELY WITH EVERYTHING ELSE IT'S JUST AN ENJOYABLE PROGRESSIVE ALBUM I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE WILL ENJOY IT HERE BUT I SURE DO

I WON'T MENTION THE DSO BECAUSE I THINK OTHER PEOPLE HAVE COVERED IT BUT LONG STORY SHORT IT'S AMAZING AND I LOVE IT
AAAL NATHRAKH THE WHOLE OF THE LAW I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS AGO I GOT A DECIBEL FLEXIDISC WITH SOME AAAL NATHRAKH STUFF I HADN'T REALLY BEEN INTO ANYTHING THAT HEAVY BUT IT STUCK WITH ME EVERY TIME THEY PUT OUT NEW MATERIAL IT'S AN EXPERIENCE THEIR MUSIC WANTS TO SHOW YOU ALL THE WAYS YOU COULD DIE AND WHAT SORT OF NOISES THAT WOULD MAKE I RECOMMEND THESE GUYS TO ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN OVERALL I THINK THIS RELEASE IS MORE VARIED IN INTENSITY THAN THEIR OLDER STUFF IT'S EASIER TO FIND A FEW HOOKS SOME SUBTLE ORCHESTRATION AND OTHER CATCHY BITS IN BETWEEN THUMPING SAMPLES AND DRAWN OUT WALLS OF NOISE I LIKE THIS ALBUM A LOT AND I THINK IT'LL HANG AROUND WITH ME FOR A BIT I'M NOT QUITE SURE YET IF THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE AAAL NATHRAKH ALBUM CURRENTLY THAT'S AMANITAS BUT IT'S IN THE RUNNING

BRUTALLY DECEASED SATANIC CORPSE THIS REMINDS ME A LOT OF THE EARLIER AND ROUGHER SWEDISH DM BANDS EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT FEELS LIKE IRON MAIDEN RECORDING DEATH METAL MY FIRST LISTENING EXPERIENCE WAS NOT GREAT AND THE ALBUM DIDN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME I PUT IT DOWN WALKED AWAY FOR A BIT AND STARTED FROM THE BEGINNING AND THE SECOND AND THIRD TIMES THROUGH THIS IS A KILLER RECORD I THINK I'LL FORGET ABOUT THIS ALBUM IN ABOUT A WEEK AND THEN IN A YEAR I'LL REMEMBER HOW MUCH I ENJOYED IT AND REPEAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS OVER AGAIN LIKE I DO WITH THAT SOLIPSIST ALBUM ONCE EVERY MONTHS

WHORES GOLD LOW BLUESY DEPRESSED ANGRY BUT CATCHIER THIS TIME AROUND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE GUITAR TONE THESE GUYS PUT TOGETHER THAT GETS ME EVERY TIME IT COMES ON I WAS A BIG FAN OF THE LAST ALBUM CLEAN AND THIS IS A BIT CATCHIER AND A LITTLE LESS IN MY OPINION IT'S JUST AS GOOD JUST IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT DIRECTION IN CLEAN IT FELT LIKE THE GROOVE PULLED ME RIGHT ALONG FROM THE FIRST NOTE AND JUST NEVER STOPPED LURCHING AND SLIDING FORWARD WITH GOLD THERE'S A LITTLE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO BREATH BETWEEN THE YELLING AND AMP STACKS
LORD FIST GREEN EILEEN

ALSO FOUND AN OBSCURE BAND THAT ISN'T AROUND ANYMORE CALLED TAILGUNNER ORIGINALLY NAMED MISTY KNIGHT

TAILGUNNER STUFF IS MORE LIKE TRADITIONAL HEAVY METAL WHILE MISTY KNIGHT WAS MORE BOOMY INTERESTING STUFF
I'M SEEING VEATOR TONIGHT SO I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO TERMINAL REDUX ALL DAY AT WORK
VLADAMAR THE FORCE OF THE ANCIENT LAND

VLADAMAR IS BASICALLY A ONE-MAN BAND PROJECT BY A GUY FROM NORWAY
HIS MUSIC STYLE IS ATMOSPHERIC AMBIENT BLACK METAL AND I'VE GOTTA SAY IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE HEARD RECENTLY I LOVE HIS MUSIC BECAUSE IT'S SO CALMING FOR ME I LISTEN TO IT WHENEVER I JUST FEEL THAT I WANNA CHILL WHAT I ALSO LIKE IS HOW HE USES KEYBOARD TO PRODUCE THESE INTERESTING RIFFS THAT CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME BUT STILL REMAIN QUITE SIMILAR HIS SONGS PRETTY MUCH DON'T HAVE LYRICS BUT HE USES A FEMALE VOICE WHICH SOMETIMES SINGS ALONG WITH THE KEYBOARD RIFF AND FROM TIME TO TIME HE INSERTS THAT AMAZING SCREECHING BLACK METAL SCREAM
VLADAMAR CURRENTLY HAS ONLY ONE ALBUM BUT I GOTTA SAY IT IS A BLAST AND I HOPE HE RELEASES MORE STUFF IN THE FUTURE
WHITECHAPEL OUR ENDLESS WAR

FAVORITE TRACKS
THE SAW IS THE LAW
BLACKED OUT
WORSHIP THE DIGITAL AGE

LOVING THE ALBUM SO FAR I THINK ITS A GREAT REALES ON THE SIDE TO WHITECHAPEL THANKS
METAL

AXEMAN ARRIVE AMEBIC HAVE BEEN ON HEAVY ROTATION FOR ME FOR MOST OF THIS YEAR AND LEARNING THAT EDUARDO RAMIREZ VIOLAN HAS AN SIDE PROJECT WAS A VERY WELCOME DISCOVERY HE S ONLY DONE A EP BUT IT S COMPLETELY SHAMELESS AND I LOVE IT MENTAL HAS A CENTRAL RIFF THAT S JUST ARISE BUT FASTER AND GRUBBIER SUPPORT

SHATAN WEIGH OF THE WOLF CONTINUING WITH THE BLACK TWILIGHT CIRCLE WORSHIP I VE BEEN LISTENING TO SHATAN S DEBUT FROM THIS YEAR IN THE CAR A LOT SHADES OF RECENT VOIVOD STUFF AND VERY REMINISCENT OF CIRCLE OF ROBOREOUS IN THE USE OF CLEAN VOCALS IN A ROUGH UG BLACK METAL SETTING SPEAKING OF WHICH

CIRCLE OF ROBOREOUS TREE OF KNOWLEDGE I VE ONLY REALLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF THESE GUYS DISCOGRAPHY BUT HAVE LIKED WHAT I VE HEAR SO FAR SO WHEN I SAW THIS FOR A COUPLE OF QUID IN NORTHERN DARKNESS CLOSING DOWN SALE I HAD TO GRAB IT IT S MORE RAW AND BLACK METAL THAN THE OTHER STUFF I VE HEARD WHICH WAS WATERY SOUNDING WITH WEIRD CLEAN VOCALS IT WORKS REALLY WELL ON THIS RECORD THOUGH THE SECOND TRACK HAS SOME GREAT BALUT AUS RIFFING ON IT


ULCERATE SHRINES OF PARALYSIS NOT SURE ABOUT THIS TSH WHEN I HEARD THE DESTROYERS OF ALL WHEN IT CAME OUT IT WAS A REVELATION I LOVED THE TENSION BETWEEN THE MEMORABLE RIFFS BRUTAL DRUMMING SENSE OF SPACE AND FEELING THAT THE SONG STRUCTURES WERE ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING DOWN ALL THE TIME VERMIS DIDN T LEAVE MUCH OF AN IMPRESSION AND THIS NEW ONE HASN T CLICKED THE FIRST HALF IS A BIT OFF-PUTTING IT HAS THAT ULCERATE SOUND BUT THEY TEAR THROUGH RIFF AFTER RIFF WHICH NEVER FEEL LIKE THEY RE GOING ANYWHERE THE SECOND HALF IS A BIT MORE SLOW OPEN SOUNDING AND ATMOSPHERIC AND ALL THE BETTER FOR IT

NEUROSIS FIRES WITHIN FIRES WHAT A RETURN TO FORM BEST THING SINCE THE EYE OF EVERY STORM AND HAS A SIMILAR FEEL TO THAT RECORD IN LOTS OF WAYS NO FILLER JUST BRILLIANTLY CRAFTED FLOWING SONGS WITH AWESOME RIFFS AND A REALLY TRANSPORTING SOUNDSCAPE ALBUM ART BY THOMAS HOOPER TOO

POWER ELECTRONICS

IRON FIST OF THE SUN BEHAVIOURAL DECLINE SAW THIS GUY SUPPORT MERZBOW IN MANCHESTER AND TO BE HONEST HE STOLE THE SHOW TRACKS WITH A SOUNDSCAPE SIMILAR TO EARLY TG IN EVOKING A GREY DECAYING BROKEN-DOWN BRITAIN THE ATMOSPHERES AND WRITING REMIND ME A LOT OF PRURIENT S BEST WORK LEADING TO

PRURIENT UNKNOWN RAINS I FOUND LAST YEAR S FROZEN NIAGRA FALLS WHICH I THINK WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOME KIND OF BREAKTHROUGH RECORD OVERLONG AND UNFOCUSED THIS NEW RECORD IS MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL IN WEDDING A DARKLY FILMIC EVEN ROMANTIC ATMOSPHERE TO PE AT A QUARTER OF THE LENGTH

PUNK

CRASS THE FEEDING OF THE THE HOPELESS POLITICAL ECONOMIC SOCIAL SITUATION SPURRED ME TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE ANARCHO STUFF I USED TO WORSHIP SO I DUG THIS OUT DEFINITELY A MIXED BAG THE LYRICS ARE FREQUENTLY ANNOYING BUT YOU FORGIVE THEM WHEN THEY RE BLASTING AWAY THROUGH TRACKS LIKE SECURICOR I LIKE THE USE OF NOISE AND THE ROUGHNESS OF THE PRODUCTION BUT IT IS VERY THIN AND WEAK A BIT LIKE A LOT OF THEIR FOLLOWERS STILL A FAN THOUGH

GUTTER GODS INNERSENSE THIS IS A WEIRD ONE STREET PUNK WITH A SCARY SKINHEAD FRONTSMAN KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE THE RAC STUFF YOU LISTEN TO ON YOUTUBE AND IMMEDIATELY FEEL GUILTY ABOUT BUT IT S GOT A WEIRD SCI-FI PSYCHEDELIC AESTHETIC AND HAS NOISE TRACKS AND SAMPLE COLLAGES MIXED IN BETWEEN THE BIFFY TRACKS DIG IT
CULETS DES GHOULS COVEN

IT'S GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER LISTEN OR TEN BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW IT'S TOP NOTCH STUFF THE AMBIANCE AND RIFFAGE ARE AS GOOD AS HENBANE BUT I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE SONGS I THINK THEY REACHED A LITTLE TOO FAR HERE AND MINUTES IS JUST TOO LONG FOR AN ALBUM FULL STOP I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER WITH A LITTLE PRUNING OF COURSE I'LL PROBABLY BUY IT AND LISTEN TO IT THIRTY TIMES BUT STILL

ARIZMENDA BENEATH THIS REALITY OF FLESH

I DON'T REALLY HAVE MANY THOUGHTS ON THIS ONE THAT I DIDN'T HAVE FOR VIOLAN I WAS PRETTY SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY MEMBERS IN COMMON BECAUSE BOTH HAVE THIS SORT OF FEEL LIKE VIOLAN THEY TAKE A LOT FROM DSO WITH CHAOS BEING THE ORDER OF THE DAY HOWEVER THESE GUYS THIS GUY NOW THAT I LOOK IT UP ARE A LITTLE CLOSER TO NIGHTBRINGER AND AHKLYS IN THEIR APPROACH I'M DEFINITELY GIVING THESE GUYS A FEW MORE SPINS AS I WORK THOUGH THIS MONSTROUS FINAL PROJECT THIS WEEK

DELETER LES HERES DE LA PESTE

FROM HOW MUCH GOOD I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS BAND I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED TO FIND HOW I DON'T KNOW CLOSE TO ATMOBLACK THEY WERE IT IS EXTREMELY TASTEFUL ATMOBLACK THOUGH AND CLOSER TO THE DEPRESSIVE END OF THINGS WHICH IS WHERE THE GENRE IN GENERAL COULD STAND TO BE I THINK REAL GOOD STUFF THOUGH AND DEFINITELY THE BEST IBM I'VE LISTENED TO THOUGH THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR MUCH

AKITA SANG NORDIQUE

ANOTHER BAND THAT WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I WAS EXPECTING I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE EITHER QUITE THIS OR QUITE THIS THE FIRST I'M COOL WITH THE SECOND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET USED TO USUALLY I'M DOWN WITH METAL BUT THIS JUST IS NOT TASTEFULLY DONE AT TIMES I FEEL WHEN IT IS TASTEFULLY DONE THOUGH IT'S REALLY GOOD I'M GOING TO GIVE THEIR LATEST ANOTHER I ONLY WENT THROUGH IT ONCE


DEATH THE SOUND OF PERSEVERANCE

I'M ONLY RECENTLY LEARNING MORE ABOUT DEATH METAL ITS SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS LIKED BUT NEVER REALLY EXPLORED ASIDE FROM THE FIRST FOUR CANNIBAL CORPSE ALBUMS I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MORE OF A BLACK METAL GUY BUT I'M A BIT BURNT OUT ON THAT RIGHT NOW EARLY THIS WEEK I JUST RANDOMLY CAME ACROSS COVER OF JUDAS PAINKILLER AT THE MARK WHILE BROWSING YOUTUBE AND I WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY BY VOCALS AND HIGH SHRIEKY VOICE ON THAT TRACK I WENT BACK TO LISTEN TO THE REST OF THE ALBUM AND FOUND MYSELF JUST IN LOVE THE INSTRUMENTATION WAS STUNNING AND VOCAL RANGE WAS ALMOST DOWNRIGHT SCARY THE ONLY THING I HAD HEARD FROM THEM BEFORE WAS ZOMBIE RITUAL ANOTHER DAMN FINE SONG SO I WAS VAGUELY FAMILIAR THE RIFFS FELT SINISTER AND SPOOKY IN A WAY THAT REMINDED ME OF THE SLOWER SLAYER ALBUMS FITTING SINCE DEATH COVERED BLACK MAGIC IN CONCERT NOT IN TERMS OF HOW THEY SOUND BUT RATHER HOW THEY MADE ME FEEL MORE THAN JUST HEAVY IT FELT ALMOST EVIL AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I FELT ON MY FIRST LISTEN WHEN LISTENING AGAIN I FEEL LIKE I FOUND SOMETHING NEW A BIT OF A MELANCHOLIC UNDERTONE TO THE MUSIC I COULD BE IMAGINING THAT I'M NOT REALLY SURE

MY ONLY GRIPE IS WITH THE INSTRUMENTAL TRACK VOICE OF THE SOUL I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH IT BEING A SOFTER TRACK IN FACT I WELCOME IT I JUST FELT THAT THIS SPECIFIC TRACK WAS UNFITTING


ALL IN ALL ITS MY FAVORITE KIND OF ALBUM THE KIND THAT MAKES ME WANT TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE DISCOGRAPHY

FAVORITE ORIGINAL TRACK OFF THE ALBUM FLESH AND THE POWER IT HOLDS
ANAGNORISIS PERIPETEIA REALLY INCREDIBLE BLACK METAL WITH A PERSONAL BACKSTORY ABOUT THE FATHER AND THEIR TERRIBLE RELATIONSHIP THE TITLE TRACK IS STUNNING
BOOB HERE SLOWLY EDUCATING MYSELF PLEASE TO THROW THINGS AT ME IF I USE WORDS INCORRECTLY

CROSS VAULT MILES TO TAKE

I LIKE THE INSTRUMENTAL PARTS OF THIS BUT I DON'T DIG THE CLEAN VOCALS FEELS KINDA JARRING TO ME SINCE THE INSTRUMENTAL PORTIONS ARE PRETTY TRADITIONALLY SOME FUZZ LAYERS ETC I HAVE A FEELING THAT I'LL LIKE THE VOCALS MORE AS I KEEP LISTENING TO THIS SO I'LL KEEP IT IN ROTATION

TREES OF ETERNITY HOUR OF THE NIGHTINGALE

BONUS POINTS FOR POETIC ALBUM NAME MELANCHOLIC IS THE WORD FOR THIS ALBUM IT'S SAD BUT THE SORT OF SAD THAT'S GENTLE AND ALMOST COMFORTING IN A WEIRD WAY MINOR TONALITY A LITTLE FUZZ BUT ENOUGH MEMORABLE RIFFS TO KEEP THINGS INTERESTING ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT QUITE THE KIND OF ALBUM WHERE YOU SIT DOWN AND DO NOTHING BUT LISTEN TO THAT I CONFESS TO WANDERING ATTENTION HALFWAY THROUGH WHEN I TRIED WHISPERY LADY VOCALS CONTRAST JUST ENOUGH WITH THE GUITARS DRUMS TO FEEL OTHERWORLDLY

DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN CALCULATING INFINITY

I HEAR THESE GUYS HAVE JUST RELEASED THEIR FINAL RECORD SO NATURALLY I'M GONNA GO LISTEN TO THEIR FIRST ONE ROLLS EYES BUT UH TIL I REALLY ENJOY MANTICORE I'M GONNA BLAME THAT ONE ON A CLASSICAL MUSIC BACKGROUND I LIKE FIGURING OUT HOW MUSICAL STUFF FITS TOGETHER I DON'T LOVE THE VOCALS A LITTLE TOO ANGST MAYBE I JUST HAD THE WRONG THING FOR LUNCH BEFORE I LISTENED TO IT BUT SINCE DEP CHANGES SINGERS AFTER THIS ALBUM I THINK LIFE WILL GO ON THIS ALBUM HAS AGED PRETTY WELL ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW INFLUENTIAL THE INTERNEES SAYS IT HAS BEEN

DREAM THEATER A DRAMATIC TURN OF EVENTS

SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THINGS ABOUT THINGS SAID THAT DREAM THEATER IS IMPORTANT AND YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM SO OFF I SKIPPED AND NOW I'M NOT COMING BACK FROM WHATEVER ALTERNATE UNIVERSE THIS IS BUZ IT'S MORE INTERESTING I LOVE HOW THIS ALBUM MANAGES TO BE A COHERENT THING WHILE ALSO DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT STUFF IN INDIVIDUAL TRACKS THESE DUDES HAVE A GIFT FOR MELODY NOT TO MENTION HOW TIGHTLY FOCUSED ALL THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTAL PARTS FEEL

AFTER THE BURIAL RE-REFORM

I KNOW DEATHCORE DOESN'T GET MUCH LOVE IN THESE PARTS I HATE THE TERM TO BE HONEST I DON'T THINK IT ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THIS PARTICULAR GENRE I'VE SEEN IT REFERRED TO AS DENT OR PROGRESSIVE METAL I PREFER THE LATTER TERM REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU DEFINE IT THIS ALBUM IS INCREDIBLE FROM BEGINNING TO END AFTER THE BURIAL CAME OUT AT A TIME WHEN I WAS JUST DEVELOPING MY PREFERENCES FOR METAL THERE WERE A SLEW OF BANDS WITH A SIMILAR SOUND BORN OF OSIRIS VEIL OF MAYA ETC I RECENTLY REVISITED A FEW OF THERE INAUGURAL ALBUMS AND I FOUND THIS ALBUM RE-REFORM FROM AFTER THE BURIAL TO BE THE ONLY ONE THAT REALLY WITHSTOOD THE TEST OF TIME THE OBVIOUS APPEAL TO THE BAND IS ITS INSANE EXECUTION OF EXTREMELY COMPLEX OPEN CHORD RHYTHMIC CHUGGING THE PATTERNS THEY USE ON ALMOST EVERY SONG ARE ELABORATE AND REQUIRE EXTENSIVE LISTENING TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT FEELS AS IF THEY BEG TO BE LISTENED TO AD NAUSEUM UNTIL THEY HAVE BEEN SOLVED BEYOND THAT THOUGH THE LEAD MELODIES ARE AS CATCHY AS THEY ARE TECHNICAL BERSERKER IS A VERY MEMORABLE TRACK RIGHT OUT OF THE GATES IT OPENS WITH A MELODIC SWEEPING LEAD THE SONG DEVELOPS INTO SOMETHING MUCH HEAVIER WITH TIME SIGNATURE TRANSITIONS AKIN TO MESHUGGAH CURSING AKHENATEN DRAWS HEAVILY ON A BLACK METAL INFLUENCE WITHOUT FALTERING FROM THE BANDS SIGNATURE MECHANICAL SOUND ASPIRATION IS A GENUINELY UNIQUE PIECE OF MUSIC THE OPENING CHORD PROGRESSION HAS A VERY PRETTY AMBIENT FEEL TO IT BEFORE THRUSTING YOU INTO ANOTHER ELABORATE SERIES OF PALM MUTED RHYTHMIC PATTERNS IN SUMMARY IF THIS GENRE ISN'T FOR YOU I IMPLORE YOU TO STEP OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE AND LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM WITH AN OPEN MIND



KHEMMIS HUNTED

THIS ALBUM HAS BEEN SO REFRESHING FOR ME I'M AT THE POINT WHERE A LOT OF MUSIC THAT COMES OUT JUST COMES ACROSS AS STAGNANT AND BORING I HAVEN'T LISTENED TO IT A MILLION TIMES OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE BUT IT ALWAYS LEAVES ME FEELING BETTER I LIKEN IT TO A COLD DRINK OF WATER ON A HOT DAY YOU ALWAYS TAKE IT FOR GRANTED UNTIL YOU LISTEN DRINK AND THEN IT'S LIKE DAMN THIS IS SOME GOOD WATER MUSIC
NECROPHAGIST EPITAPH

I AM UNSURE AS TO HOW TO TITLE THE LINK SO HOPEFULLY WHAT I POSTED BENEATH WILL SUFFICE
NECROPHAGIST HAS BEEN A SUPER UNIT SINCE THE LATE THEY ARE GERMAN BASED BUT HAVE ALWAYS REVERTED TO ENGLISH LYRICS OF WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN SHEER BRUTALITY SUPER DIVERSE TEMPOS AND MELODIC HEAVY RIFFS OF WHICH RARELY REPEAT THEMSELVES YOU WILL HEAR DEATH METAL RENDITIONS OF ORIGINAL CLASSICAL MUSIC FOR EXAMPLE NECROPHAGISTS SONG ONLY ASH REMAINS HAS A FITTING SAMPLE OF SERGEI DANCE OF THE KNIGHTS WHETHER YOU ARE A MUSICIAN AND CAN APPRECIATE GOOD TECH OR SOMEONE WHO JUST LOVES TO BLUDGEON BRAIN CELLS WITH YOUR HORNS UP THESE FELLOWS WILL LAND ON YOUR FAVORITES LIST
BENEATH THE MASSACRE EVIDENCE OF INEQUITY EP

CREATIVE WRITING WITH SICKENING BLASTS AND CAPPY RIFFS BENEATH THE MASSACRE IS BASED OUT OF QUEBEC CANADA DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU CANADIANS DO NOT MELT FACES THEIR STYLE IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN MOST OTHER DEATH METAL GROUPS THEY UTILIZE SOME POLYPHONIC RIFFS AND TREMOLO IN BETWEEN HATEFUL CHUGGING IF THE FIRST SONG ON THIS EP DOESN'T SELL YOU THEN MAYBE YOU'RE MORE OF A DEATH METAL OG THEIR APPROACH ON JAMS IS DEFINITELY NEW SCHOOL LITTLE HINTS OF EGYPT REMIND YOU OF NILE WHILE SOME OF THEIR SUPER FAST RIFF LINES AND DRUMMING WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO ORIGIN WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT THESE GUYS IS THEY ARE A WONDERFUL INTRO TO INTENSELY HEAVY DEATH METAL FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WOULD LIKE TO CONVINCE YOUR GIRLFRIENDS TO HEAD BANG WITH YOU MELODIC TECHNICAL AND HEAVY JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT
JUST RECENTLY BEEN EXPLORING MORE DEATH METAL FROM NILE BOLT THROWER DYING FETUS IMMOLATION AUTOPSY AND DEATHGRIND WITH ABORTED ALSO DANTESCO AN EPIC DOOM METAL BAND FROM MY HOMELAND OF PUERTO RICO THEY HAVE AMAZING STUFF WITH INCREDIBLE PRODUCTION MOST OF THEIR SONGS ARE IN SPANISH THOUGH BUT THEY STARTED MAKING SOME IN ENGLISH TAKE A LISTEN TO CARNIFEX BY THEM IF YOU WANNA CHECK THEM OUT
BROTHERS OF THE SONIC CLOTH LAVA

WATCH V JIL
THIS DESERVES SO MUCH MORE ATTENTION
I'VE BEEN LISTEN TO A BAND THAT I JUST RECENTLY DISCOVERED CALLED THE BLOODY HAMMERS A LOT LATELY THEY'RE NOT VERY HEAVY THEY HAVE A STYLE THAT IS SIMILAR TO BLACK SABBATH BUT STILL SOUND UNIQUE THEY DO IT REALLY WELL ASIDE FROM THAT IT'S BEEN NONSTOP BLACK METAL FOR WEEKS BATORY SATANIC BARMASTER GOD SEED BURTRUM DARK THRONE INQUISITION ETC
TEMPEL OF BAAL MYSTERIUM

BEAUTIFUL CRAFTED BLACKENED DEATH FROM FRANCE LOADS OF RIFFS ACCOMPANIED WITH UNRELENTING AND GREAT VOCAL WORK

THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER ABYSMAL

I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO SAY MUCH HERE IT'S A KILLER ALBUM AND I RECENTLY GOT BACK IN LOVE WITH TBD

DISSECTION NIGHTS BLOOD

ENTOMBED WOLVERINE BLUES
THIS ALBUM MAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE GUITAR TONE THAT GETS ME BUT IT JUST DOES EVERY SINGLE TIME
I HAVE BEEN LISTEN TO A LOT OF METAL RECENTLY AFTER A LONG HIATUS AND LAST NIGHT I REMEMBERED THIS GREAT BAND CALLED PSYPHERIA I USED TO LISTEN TO BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY'RE TECHNICAL DM DONE THE RIGHT WAY NO TECHNICAL CANKERY WHATSOEVER JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT ALONG WITH SHEER BRUTALITY AND REALLY SICK KEYBOARDS

THEY'RE ARE OBVIOUSLY INFLUENCED BY NOCTURNES BUT W O THE SPACEY VIBE MORE LIKE VIBE

CATHARTIC DEGENERATION IS MY FAVOURITE TRACK BY THEM ALTHOUGH FLESH MUST BURN IS A CLOSE SECOND

I REALLY RECOMMEND LISTENING TO THEIR ALBUM EMBRACE THE MUTATION IN FULL YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED
NIGHTWEAR
I KNOW I'M WAY LATE TO THE PARTY BUT JESTER RACE BY IN FLAMES AND I LOVE IT

REMOVED
UPON A BURNING BODY BRING THE RAIN AND THE NEW ALBUM STRAIGHT FROM THE BARRIO WITH SONGS LIKE ALREADY BROKEN

I GREW UP LIKING ILL NICO AND SAW ABB AT A FESTIVAL WITH A BUNCH OF SUMERIAN RECORDS ACTS I LIKE THEIR ATTITUDE AND MIX OF SPANISH GANGSTER BADASSERY INTO THEIR MUSIC

ARTY CONTENDER
I KNOW THIS IS REALLY AWFUL BUT I FINALLY LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM LAST WEEK IT'S BEEN SITTING ON MY IPOD YES I STILL HAVE ONE FOR MONTHS AND I ONLY LISTENED TO IT NOW

I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE RIFFS IT WAS DIFFERENT THAN I WAS IMAGINING ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE A DEATH METAL ALBUM ANYWAYS IT'S A COOL ALBUM THAT REALLY DOES DESERVE MORE LISTENS
HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THIS ALBUM ONE OF THE BETTER BM RECORDS THIS YEAR IN MY BOOKLET
I REALLY HOPE THAT THEY HAVE THE PRESALE TICKETS FOR PSYCHO CALIFORNIA AS WELL BECAUSE GETTING TICKETS FOR MYSELF AND MY GIRLFRIEND AT FOR THE WEEKEND IS WAY MORE DOABLE THAN

FANTASTIC ALBUM

POSSIBLY THE MOST MEDIOCRE BAND PROJECT RUN BY A LABEL OWNER IN THE UNDERGROUND
IF YOU WANT TO GET INTO CAVERNOUS DEATH METAL BUT ARE HAVING A HARD TIME CONNECTING GRAVE MIASMA IS PROBABLY THE BEST BET AT LEAST THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE SUPERSET WITH VASTUS IF YOU NEED SOME HELP
NOOOOW THIS IS A STORY ALL ABOUT HOW MY LIFE GOT TWISTED TURNED UPSIDE DOWN

NOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE AND DISCUSS THE PAIN THAT COMES WITH RECEIVING AN ARTIFICIAL BRAIN
SAW THESE GUYS PLAY A BASEMENT LAST YEAR ON MY BIRTHDAY THEY FUCKING KILLED IT

THIS WAS ROBB FLYNN AND PHIL DEMMER OF MACHINE ORIGINAL BAND RIGHT

METAL CHURCH IS ALWAYS WELCOME

START THE FIRE
I HAVE TO SAY THIS ALBUM WAS A BIG STEP DOWN FOR ME FOR SYMPHONY X DON'T GET ME WRONG THERE'S STILL A TON OF GREAT MATERIAL BUT IT'S THEIR MOST GENERIC ALBUM BY FAR THAT BEING SAID MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF THEIRS IS TWILIGHT IN OLYMPUS SO I PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
I REALLY LOVE THIS ALBUM JUST RECENTLY TOOK A CLOSER LISTEN TO THE LAST SONG ON THE ALBUM AND I HAVE TO SAY I'M IMPRESSED

THIS TRACK ON THE OTHER HAND IS CHEESY MELODEATH AND PROBABLY THE WORST OF THE WHOLE ALBUM THE BREAKDOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG IS PRETTY EMBARRASSING AND THE SOLO AFTER IT IS OUTRIGHT HILARIOUS THE SOLO GUITAR STILL CREATES AN INTERESTING EARWORM PROBABLY THE ONLY SAVING GRACE OF THIS TRACK
LOVE ME SOME INTESTINE BAALISM
THEIR ONLY GOOD ALBUM AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED BIT TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE DEATH METAL SOUND AND INTO IN FLAMES AFTER THIS ONE

THE UNDERGROUND NOD

SOMETHING THAT IS INTERESTING AT THE END OF THE YEAR IS SEEING A LIST OF PRETTY EXPECTED RECORDS WITH A RANDOM UNDERGROUND FAVORITE THROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE THESE ARE SMALLER RECORDS THAT EXPERIENCED A SURGE IN POPULARITY ON A LARGER STAGE THESE ARE ALSO RECORDS THAT CAN BE USED TO LEGITIMIZE AN OTHERWISE ORDINARY LIST IF BOLDER IS AT THEN PEOPLE WONT MIND IF JAPETH IS AT

SUMMERLAND SUMMERLAND
AOR GUARDIANS
VEATOR TERMINAL REDUX
ALLEGATION PROPONENT FOR SENTIENCE STOP KILLING METAL
TREES OF ETERNITY HOUR OF THE NIGHTINGALE RECENT PASSING OF THE SINGER MIGHT MIMIC WOODS OF YPRES FAME

ALBUM THAT WAS A BIG DEAL WHEN IT WAS RELEASED BUT PROBABLY WONT GET ANY ATTENTION EVEN FROM ITS FANS

INSOMNIOUS GATE
MEGADEATH DYSTOPIA



MET A KID AT THE DARK TRANQUILITY SHOW WHO WAS FRESH INTO METAL IT WAS FUN SEEING HIM HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND TAKE IN ALL THE RECS I THREW AT HIM INVITED HIM TO JOIN R METAL SO THIS POST IS MOSTLY FOR HIM IF HE BOTHERED TO MAKE A REDDIN ACCOUNT
I HAD A MINOR BATORY REVELATION THE OTHER DAY PREVIOUSLY I'VE STATED THAT WHILE THEY ARE IMPORTANT THE MUSIC NEVER CLICKED FOR ME

AFTER LISTENING TO THE CELT NATION BATORY S T COVER ALBUM I WENT BACK AND LISTENED TO THE REAL THING TO MY SURPRISE I ENDED UP ENJOYING IT A LOT MORE THAN BEFORE NO IDEA WHY THAT'S THE CASE BUT THERE YOU GO I'M GOING TO WORK MY WAY THROUGH THEIR DISCOGRAPHY PROPER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

CAN WE CHILL OUT WITH THE AMOUNT OF METALLICA THREADS THE ALBUM HASN'T EVEN BEEN RELEASED AND WE'VE SEEN ABOUT FIVE I GET THAT METALLICA IS YOUR FAVORITE BAND BUT THERE ARE SO MANY ALBUMS WORTHY OF DISCUSSION THIS YEAR AND CONSTANTLY TALKING ABOUT METALLICA PUSHES THEM OUT THIS IS R METAL WE HAVE A WHOLE GENRE TO DISCUSSION
WHAT IS YOUR BLACK METAL ARTY

THE MORE I SPIN CONDEMNATION BY ANTAEUS THE MORE I'M CONVINCED IT'S BY FAR MY FAVOURITE BM ALBUM OF THIS YEAR IT FEELS LIKE THE MISSING LINK BETWEEN DPE AND BLOOD LIBELS
WHAT IS THE MOST POPULAR METAL BAND YOU LISTEN TO THAT WAS FORMED AFTER THE TURN OF THE CENTURY

EDIT I ASK THIS QUESTION PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THE BEST BANDS FROM MODERN TIMES ARE BURIED IN OBSCURITY SO I AM CURIOUS WHICH ARE THE MORE POPULAR BANDS THAT ARE LISTENED TO BY THE VETERAN USERS HERE
TO THOSE OF YOU IN BANDS HAVE YOUSE EVER BUMPED INTO SOMEONE IN THE STREET WEARING YOUR MERCH OR PULLED UP AT THE LIGHTS AND HEARD ANOTHER CAR PLAYING YOUR MUSIC
WHAT ARE THOUGHTS ON TOOL I'M PLANNING TO EXPLORE THEIR MUSIC GONNA BUY UNDERTOW AENIGMA AND LATERALIS
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO IN SWEDEN THERE SEEMED TO BE A NEW SCENE FORMING THAT CONSISTED OF A BUNCH OF OLD SCHOOL WORSHIPPING DEATH METAL BANDS

THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT JUST AS SOON AS THE SCENE POPPED UP IT SEEMED TO DIE OUT WITH A LOT OF THE BANDS ONLY RELEASING A DEMO OR TWO BEFORE SPLITTING FOR GOOD SOME STUCK AROUND AND RELEASED ALBUMS I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS ANY INTEREST HERE IN A POSSIBLE THREAD ABOUT SAID BANDS WITH LINKS TO THEIR STUFF

I BOUGHT A LOT OF TAPES AND WENT TO A LOT OF GIGS AT THE TIME WAS SOME OF THE MOST FUN I'VE HAD
DO YOU GUYS THINK I AM MISSING AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EXPERIENCE IF I DON'T READ THE LYRICS

I FIND IT TIME CONSUMING TO READ THE LYRICS WHILE LISTENING TO DEATH AND BLACK METAL I COULD BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE WHILE LISTENING

AT THE SAME TIME I'M REALLY INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT THE LYRICS ARE ABOUT BUT I KNOW I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT IS BEING SAID SINCE ENGLISH ISN'T MY FIRST LANGUAGE I IMAGINE IT'S STILL DIFFICULT FOR ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE TOO WHEN IT COMES TO EXTREME METAL
SAW THE CARCASS DEAFHEAVEN TOUR LAST WEEKEND DEAFHEAVEN HAD A REALLY GOOD LIVE SOUND BUT MAN THAT IS ONE GOOFY ODD BAND THE GUITAR PLAYERS EVENTUALLY GOT INTO A GROOVE BUT FOR THE FIRST TWO SONGS WERE PLAYING OFF RHYTHM WITH EACH OTHER MEANING THAT THE TREMOLOS FROM THE GUITARS WERE SEEMINGLY IN OPPOSITION TO EACH OTHER MAKING THE MUSIC SOUND MORE LIKE DEATHSPELL OR SOMETHING THEY EVENTUALLY FIGURED IT OUT ALTHOUGH I THINK MOVING TO ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM AND GETTING MOSTLY ONE GUITAR HELPED THIS COULD ALSO EXPLAIN WHY THE GUYS SPEND EVERY IN-BETWEEN BITCHING AT THE SOUND BOARD

THEIR SINGER IS LIKE YOU TOOK THE GUY FROM EIGHTEEN VISIONS AND CROSSED HIM WITH JONATHAN DAVIS CIR A COMPLETE GOOF WHO MOVES HIS HANDS LIKE HE'S CONDUCTING

CARCASS AT THIS POINT IS A LEGACY BAND AND DON'T LET THE NEW ALBUM CONFUSE YOU AS SUCH I HAD A GREAT TIME HOLDING MY BEER IN THE AIR DURING HEARTWORM AND NO LOVE LOST THEY DID SOME MEDLEYS OF THE ALBUMS THAT ISOLATED MOSTLY THE RIFFS SO THAT WAS ON THE BRIGHTER SIDE AFTER SEEING PEOPLE CARRYING OPEN BEERS THROUGH THE PIT AREA SEVERAL TIMES I WAS TREATED TO SEEING SOMEONE LOSE ABOUT BUCKS WORTH OF DRINKS AS THEY HAPHAZARDLY AVOIDED THE PERIODIC COSHING THAT HAPPENED TO SPRING UP AS THE GUY WALKED ACROSS THE FLOOR HE TOOK IT PRETTY WELL I THOUGHT
HEY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE DISCUSSED THIS YET BUT I'VE LISTENED TO ABOUT HALF OF THE BOLDER ALBUM SO FAR AND I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED

I FEEL LIKE THEY'VE PULLED A MASTODON ON US WHERE THE VOCALS GET SO WATERED DOWN TO THE POINT THAT THE MUSIC IS ALSO WATERED DOWN IT FEELS ILKS BOLDER HAS NEUTERED THEMSELVES AND I CAN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT WHY

ANYWAYS PRETTY DISAPPOINTED IN THAT ALBUM ALL THAT HYPE OVER THE YEARS AND THIS IS WHAT WE GOT THOUGHTS
AFTER ALMOST SEMESTERS OF LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION I'VE COLLECTED A MODEST LIST OF EXCELLENT BAND NAMES AND SONG ALBUM TITLES FROM THE CLASSIC BOOKS WE READ AND THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE ON THEM THE LIST IS AS FOLLOWS

A SLEEP OF IRON VIRGIL AENEID X

THE DUEL OF MARS VIRGIL AENEID XII

THE STRONGER MUST PREVAIL PASCAL ON THE EQUILIBRIUM OF LIQUIDS

THE PUNISHMENT OF METIUS LIVY THE RISE OF ROME I IT'S ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL HE WAS TORN APART BY THE LIMBS BY FOUR TEAMS OF HORSES

VIOLENT USURPATION LIVY THE RISE OF ROME I

OUR FLESH WILL RISE FOR IMMORTALITY STREET AUGUSTINE THE SPIRIT AND THE LETTER

ATOMIC ANAXIMANDER THE NICKNAME BESTOWED BY MY CLASS UPON THE PRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHER HERACLITUS WHOSE WRITINGS ARE LIKE OF THOSE OF ANOTHER PRE-SOCRATIC ANAXIMANDER COMBINED WITH ATOMIC THEORY

MERCURIAL DEPHLOGISTICATION BASED ON SOME EXPERIMENTS DONE IN SUPPORT OF THE OLD PHLOGISTON THEORY

FUTURE MORE VIVID WITH EMPHATIC PROTASIS A LATIN SYNTACTICAL TERM

RHOTACISM OF THE INTERVOCALIC S A LATIN MORPHOLOGICAL TERM

REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM A LINE OF ARGUMENT THAT TAKES UP ONE OR MORE ALTERNATE POSSIBILITIES AND SHOWS THEM TO REACH ABSURD CONCLUSIONS ELIMINATING IMPOSSIBILITIES UNTIL THE TRUTH IS REACHED

THERE'S PROBABLY SOME I'M MISSING BUT THAT'S ALL I'VE WRITTEN DOWN SO FAR

MEGA EDIT ALSO LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS WRITING A PAPER I GOT SO BORED AT ONE POINT THAT I TRANSLATED MY THESIS STATEMENT INTO DEATH METAL ENGLISH JUST FOR KICKS HERE IT IS BONUS POINTS IF ANYONE CAN TRANSLATE IT BACK THE ERRONEOUS PROCLAMATION OF THE WARRIOR SON OF ATREUS HATH BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PROVEN UNTO UTTER FALSEHOOD BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF PROLONGED DEITEIAL SORROW AND THE PARTAKING OF MORTAL DELUSIONS WHICH HATH BEEN THE APEX OF DIVINE EXPLOITS PERPETRATED BY THE PANTHEON OF OLYMPIAN IMMORTALS

WENT TO A SMALL SHOW WITH A BUNCH OF LOCAL DEATH METAL BANDS OPENING AND THE MAIN ACT WAS SORT OF PROGRESSIVE BLACK DEATH THEY WERE AMAZING BUT ONLY PEOPLE STAYED NEAR THE STAGE SERIOUSLY DON'T GET WHY AMERICANS AREN'T INTERESTED IN THIS MUSIC I LIVE IN THE WRONG COUNTRY LOL BUT I WILL ADMIT NAPALM DEATH AND BAM WERE PLAYING THE SAME NIGHT WHICH SUCKED FOR THEM
I'M INTERESTED IN HOW BLACK METAL HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE OF RECOMMENDATIONS I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO FIRST FOR THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS OFF AND ON AND I DON'T HAVE THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE TO HEAR THIS AS BLACK METAL AT LEAST COMPARED TO MODERN BLACK WHICH IS OR AT LEAST SEEMS TO BE VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON TREMOLO PICKING AND BLAST BEATS

COMPARATIVELY I'VE ALSO BEEN LISTENING A LOT TO NEWEST SLOW FOREVER WHICH IS FUCKING AMAZING AND IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY BLACK METAL EITHER GIN YES BUT SLOW FOREVER REMINDS ME MORE OF A THRASH PUNKY I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF METAL IS IT AN ARTIFACT OF THEIR HISTORY THAT THE ALBUM IS CONSIDERED BLACK METAL OR AM I JUST NOT WELL-VERSED ENOUGH IN THE FULL RANGE OF THE GENRE TO HEAR IT ON THIS RECORD

ADDITIONALLY ORANSSI VARAHTELIJA IS BLACK METAL BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL AS BLACK METAL AS EXERCISES IN FUTILITY OR EMPEROR'S IN THE NIGHTSIDE ECLIPSE SAME WITH DEATHSPELL THE SYNARCHY OF MOLTEN BONES

ANYONE HAVE A PRIMER OR INTRO TO BLACK METAL TO HELP ME OUT
I'VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR PROBABLY YEARS NOW WITH VARIOUS ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE LONG SINCE BEEN DELETED

WE HAVE SOME PRETTY TALENTED WRITERS HERE WITH SOME WRITING ABOUT MUSIC BEING THEIR MAIN HOBBY OR EVEN THEIR JOB AND THAT'S AWESOME I'VE THOUGHT OF PARTICIPATING MORE MYSELF ESPECIALLY IN WHYBLT THREADS ETC BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO TALK ABOUT MUSIC

I LIKE WHAT I LIKE AND I DON'T KNOW WHY I LIKE IT BUT I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND MAYBE EVEN ARTICULATE IT SOMETIMES

HOW DID YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU LIKE OR WHY YOU LIKE IT HOW DO YOU DISSECT MUSIC AND JUDGE IT BY ITS PARTS


PREORDER FOR MORS PRINCIPIUM EST EMBERS OF A DYING WORLD ARE UP DOWNLOAD DIGIPAK RED-BLACK MARBLED VINYL
I DON'T EXPECT ANYONE HERE TO CARE BUT I'M SEEING DISTURBED IN 2 DAYS THEY WERE MY FAVOURITE BAND FOR A FEW YEARS FROM WHEN I WAS AND I'VE ALWAYS LIKED THEM SINCE SO I'M PRETTY EXCITED TO FINALLY SEE THEM LIVE
DEVILKIN IS OPENING FOR THEM TOO WHICH IS COOL BECAUSE I'M ON THE FENCE ABOUT BUYING TICKETS TO THEIR SHOW SO THIS IS A PERFECT TEST RUN
ALBUMS FROM BANDS YOU DON'T LIKE OR EVEN HATE THAT YOU LIKE
AS OF RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IF I WERE TO MAKE AN HONEST TOP OR EVEN FOR THIS YEAR IT WOULD ONLY INCLUDE METAL THERES A LOT OF STUFF I STILL HAVE TO LISTEN IN OTHER GENRES BUT GOD DAMN METAL HAS HAD A GOOD YEAR

ONE THAT HAS SNUCK IN ON THE LIST SO FAR IS FYRNASK BORN I'VE NEVER HEARD ANY OF THEIR STUFF BEFORE AND IT BLEW ME AWAY SUCH AN INTERESTING BLACK METAL ALBUM
SEEING ENTOMBED AD AND VOIVOD TOMORROW
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH DAVE MUDSTAIN I HEARD HE'S XENOPHOBIC OR SOMETHING IS THIS TRUE
YOU EVER HAVE THAT SONG THAT YOU KNOW SUCKS BUT YOU JUST LOVE IT FOR SOME REASON ANYWAYS I'M HAVING THAT WITH JUDAS COVER OF JOHNNY B GOODE RIGHT NOW I PICKED UP RAM IT DOWN ON AMAZON FOR QUITE LITERALLY A DOLLAR MOSTLY FOR THAT JUICY SOLO IN THE TITLE TRACK ABSOLUTE CHEESEBALL OF A RECORD BUT YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT I'VE HAD THAT JOHNNY B GOODE CHORUS STUCK IN MY HEAD FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW I DUNNO MAYBE I SHOULD GET MY HEAD CHECKED OUT OR SOMETHING
WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE HEAVY METAL AS IN TRADITIONAL METAL NOT ANY FUCKING THING YOU WANT TO SAY ALBUMS FROM THIS YEAR GOTTA GO WITH DEMON BITCH TAROT LETHAL STEEL RAVENSIRE AND SUMMERLAND SO FAR PERSONALLY

WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE BLUES ROCK AND HEAVY PSYCH ALBUMS THIS YEAR I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NONE WHICH IS A STEP DOWN FROM LAST YEAR'S GRAVEYARD KANDAHAR THE DEVIL AND THE ALMIGHTY BLUES AND GOLDEN VOID ALBUMS
I'VE BEEN DIGGING AROUND ON BANDCAMP A WHOLE LOT LATELY AND I'M KINDA CURIOUS AND A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT WHY SOME BANDS ARE LABELED THE WAY THEY ARE BANDS LIKE DYNATRON COST MASTER BOOT RECORD AND PERTURBATOR ARE COMING UP UNDER THE BLACK METAL TAGS IS THAT STUFF CONSIDERED BLACK METAL NOW OR IS IT JUST LABELED AS SUCH BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE BLACK METAL FANS ARE INTERESTED IN IT NOT TRYING TO START SOME KIND OF GENRE ARGUMENT I'M JUST WONDERING I MEAN I DON'T THINK IT'S BAD OR ANYTHING I ACTUALLY PICKED UP THE DIGITAL DOWNLOAD OF THE RIGEL AXIOM AND IT'S FUN WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE LABELED THAT WAY BECAUSE OF A PERCEIVED OVERLAP OF INTEREST BUT WHO KNOWS
GIVE ME YOUR FAVORITE METAL GENRES

MY LIST IN NO ORDER

MELODEATH
GRINDCORE
METALCORE
BLACK METAL
THRASH METAL
WHAT IS THE WORST ALBUM OF THAT YOU'VE HEARD

I LISTENED TO THE NEW ANAGNORISIS ALBUM EARLIER OUT OF CURIOSITY AND WOW I FOUND MYSELF PHYSICALLY CRINGING THEY HAVE BLURRED THE LINES BETWEEN BLACK METAL AND EMO IN WAYS I NEVER IMAGINED THE SAMPLES OF THE LITTLE KID TALKING THE YOUNGER VERSION OF THE SINGER FELT MORE OFFENSIVE TO ME THAN ANY I HAVE EVER HEARD BEFORE IF YOU THOUGHT DEAFHEAVEN WAS BAD THEN I CHALLENGE YOU TO LISTEN TO THIS FFA BRAND NEW AND FEELS

ON A SIDE NOTE I HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO GET INTO USKUMGALLU AND OTHER VRASUBATLAT BUT AM NOT REALLY GETTING IT I'M A FAN OF URZEIT AND TRIUMVIR FOUL WAS DECENT ENOUGH I JUST HAVEN'T FOUND ENOUGH REDEEMING QUALITIES TO WANT TO KEEP COMING BACK IF USKUMGALLU IS HIGH ON YOUR LIST WHAT ABOUT IT STANDS OUT FOR YOU
WHO ELSE IS COMING TO HELLFEST FOR THE EDITION
THANKS TO ALL THE UNLOADERS FOR POPULATING YOUTUBE WITH NEW STUFF TO DISCOVER IT'S A GOOD EVENINGS ENTERTAINMENT READING THE MOUTHBREATHERS ASPERGE IN THE COMMENTS WHILE TAKING IN SOME NEW TUNES
HAS ANYONE LISTENED TO THE NEW TREES OF ETERNITY ALBUM HOW WAS IT
SO I JUST FOUND THE BAND ISKRA THE OTHER DAY AND ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY HAVE FREE DOWNLOADS OF ALL THEIR MUSIC LINK HETP BUT I'M A LITTLE HESITANT BECAUSE THE DOWNLOAD IS FROM MEDIAFIRE AND WHEN YOU CLICK TO DOWNLOAD THE WEBPAGE REDIRECTS TO WHAT LOOKS LIKE MALWARE POP-UP BUT THE DOWNLOAD DOES BEGIN THE FILE SIZES ARE ALSO WHICH SEEM REALLY BIG CAN ANYONE TELL ME IF THESE FILES ARE SAFE TO DOWNLOAD
WHAT'S THE MOST EVIL SOUNDING ALBUM IN YOUR OPINION

FOR ME FEW THINGS COME CLOSE TO DAWN OF POSSESSION BY IMMOLATION THE DEEP GROWLS DISSONANT DOWNTURNED RIFFS AND PINCH HARMONICS MAKE IT ACTUALLY SOUND DIABOLICAL
IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED I HAVE A PLUG DJ ROOM FOR BLACK METAL IVE FOUND MORE BLACK METAL IN THE PAST FEW DAYS SINCE POSTING IT ON R BLACKMETAL THAN I HAVE IN MONTHS


REMOVED
THIS'LL BE KIND OF A WEIRD QUESTION BUT LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS I'M EXTRAORDINARILY NEUROTIC ABOUT MAKING LISTS OF NEW RELEASES AND FILING THEM INTO LISTENING LISTS ON THEIR RELEASE DATE BUT I NOTICED A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT ARCTIC THUNDER HAD COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED FROM MY LISTS I'M THINKING THAT THAT RELEASE DATE OCTOBER MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN DELETED INSTEAD OF COPIED AND NOW I'M WORRIED THAT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER RELEASES FROM THAT DATE THAT MIGHT ALSO HAVE DISAPPEARED SO ANYONE KNOW WHAT OTHER ALBUMS CAME OUT ON OCTOBER OR ANYWHERE I COULD LOOK THAT INFORMATION UP
SO I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS LISTENING TO SHUFFLE ON PONTIFY AND IT DECIDED TO KICK MY ASS FOR NEARLY 2 HOURS WITH A FRANKLY FANTASTIC PLAYLIST I ASSUME THAT IT BUGGED OUT BECAUSE IT REPEATEDLY FOCUSED ON CERTAIN ARTISTS NOTABLY SECRET CHIEFS

HAS ANYBODY ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS
PLAYLIST HERE
SO HOW ABOUT THEM HAIL SPIRIT NOIR I'VE GIVEN THE NEW ALBUM A FEW SPINS NOW AND IT REALLY CLICKED TODAY I LIKE JUST ABOUT EVERY SONG ON THERE AND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE IT'LL END UP ON MY TOP LIST FOR THE YEAR
TESTAMENT'S NEW ALBUM BROTHERHOOD OF THE SNAKE IS NOT GETTING NEARLY ENOUGH LOVE OR ATTENTION THIS IS EASILY THEIR BEST ALBUM SINCE THE GATHERING AWESOME RIFFS THROUGHOUT THE ALBUM AND CHUCK PROVES ONCE AGAIN THAT HE'S STILL THE BEST OLD SCHOOL THRASH VOCALIST STILL GOING TODAY
FOR ANYONE WHO WAS IN THAT METALLICA THREAD YESTERDAY HERE'S MY PERSONAL REVIEW OF HARDWIRED TO SELF DESTRUCT

IT FUCKING SUCKED
FOAH IS TRAVIS RYAN FROM CATTLE DECAPITATION THE VOCALIST FOR ANAL TRUMP
FOUND THIS COMPILATION OF THE FIRST TWO DEMOS AND TWO BONUS LIVE TRACKS ON BANDCAMP OVER HERE THERE'S ALSO A LIVE ALBUM FROM
DAT WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER INTRODUCTION

I COULD NEVER REALLY GET INTO NEVERMORE BUT I KINDA DIG THIS I MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE THEM ANOTHER SHOT THIS IS GROOVY STUFF
I MISS THIS BAND SO MUCH
THEIR DEMO COMP IS ABSOLUTELY KILLER
HAHA THE BAND NIRVANA ALWAYS THROWS ME OFF FOR A SECOND BUT ON A SERIOUS NOTE INTERNMENT FUCKING KILLS
RIP BETTER DRUDKH
THRASH SONG OF THE YEAR

III SAWWWW THE DEVILLLL

LURKINGGGG

WITHIN MYSELFFFF
THIS IS SOME TASTY THRASH I'M GOING TO GIVE THE WHOLE ALBUM A LISTEN
NICE TO HERE SOME BUZZY METAL FROM DOWNUNDER JUST LIKE METAL MASTERS PARKWAY DRIVE M
THEY NEED TO WORK ON THEIR ALBUM ARTICLE
DADDY DIKEY
THAT FUCKING RIFF THO
I LIKE THRASH METAL
HAVE THIS ALBUM SOMEWHERE DIDN'T LIKE IT BEFORE BUT I'LL CHECK IT OUT AGAIN
ONE OF THE FEW SONGS I LIKE
LOVE THIS FUCKING SONG

CAN PUNGENT STENCH BE UNDERRATED
AH IT'S BEEN TOO LONG SINCE I LISTENED TO THIS BAND THANKS FOR THE LINK
HOW MANY DID THEY MAKE
IF YOU LIKED THIS I DEFINITELY THINK YOU SHOULD CHECKOUT THE SONG CARNIFEX FROM THEM THAT ONE IS IN ENGLISH

MAN I GUESS I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO THINKS THIS NAILS CUT RULES
NAILS GOT EMBARRASSED ON THIS SPLIT
CANT WAIT TO SEE FULL OF HELL WHO NEEDS ENTOMBED AD ANYWAYS
VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE SEEN THEM BOTH WHEN THEY TOURED TOGETHER UNREAL SHOW
FULL OF HELL ONLY GETS BETTER WITH EACH RELEASE THEY PUT OUT I'M MOIST WITH ANTICIPATION FOR THEIR NEXT LP
ORDERED THIS ON VINYL AND TRYING TO WAIT FOR IT TO ARRIVE BEFORE LISTENING

GLAD NAILS IS BACK TOGETHER AND THAT THEY WILL BE PLAYING POWER OF THE RIFF FEST NEXT MONTH AWESOME LINEUP


NAILS WAS SO WEAK ON THIS FULL OF HELL KILLED IT AS ALWAYS

THE DAY I DISCOVERED FULL OF HELL THEY WE'RE PLAYING A MINUTE DRIVE FROM MY HOUSE WHY I DIDN'T GO WATCH THEM IS BEYOND ME HOPEFULLY THEY'LL COME BACK SOMETIME SOON

MAW LISTENING TO THIS SPLIT
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT WAS THE FIRST BLACK METAL BAND THAT I'VE EVER HEARD I WASN'T EVEN INTO BM AT THE TIME I JUST SAW THEM MENTIONED ON A YOUTUBE VIDEO AND DECIDED TO GO A LITTLE DEEPER I THOUGHT THEY WERE REALLY GOOD BUT HAVEN'T LISTENED TO THEM SINCE
I LOVE THIS EP ESPECIALLY THIS SONG I GOT SEVERAL DOWNVOTES IMMEDIATELY WHEN I POSTED IT AWHILE BACK GLAD TO SEE SOMEBODY ELSE LIKES IT
FAVORITE SONG OFF THIS ALBUM THEY PLAYED IT LIVE WHEN I SAW THEM EARLIER THIS YEAR WAS AWESOME
THANK YOU FOR THIS HAVE ANYMORE THRASH LIKE THIS

REALLY REFLECTIVE OF MODERN TIMES AND THE FAILURE OF THE STATE
I LOVE THIS BAND BUT I'M A SUCKER FOR ALMOST ANY BLACK SPEED THESE GUYS ALSO DID MY FAVORITE COVER OF MY FAVORITE BATORY SONG WITCHCRAFT EDIT WAIT NO MORBID SLAUGHTER DID IT BEST
GREAT ALBUM MIGHT BE TOP FOR ME
SEEING THEM TONIGHT GOING TO BE AN ETHEREAL EXPERIENCE
IS A GREAT PART OF THE SONG
HE'S NOT WRONG
I'D ARGUE THAT IN SOME REGIONS ANTI-CHRISTIANITY IS STILL APT NAMELY THE SOUTHERN US IT'S STILL AN EVER-PRESENT PART OF THE CULTURE AT THE EXPENSE OF QUALITY OF LIFE FOR

THAT BEING SAID ATTACKING CHRISTIANITY IN THE TYPICAL WAY WITH BLASPHEMY HAS BECOME AND THE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE MORE ON ATTACKING THE CULTURE THAT HAS SPRUNG UP AND THRIVED IN THE WASTELAND OF AND ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM THAT IT'S LEFT IN ITS WAKE
I LIKE HOW THAT'S THE TITLE OF THE INTERVIEW BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE A RATHER THAN THE THEME OF THE INTERVIEW
IT'S STILL FUN THOUGH
I THOUGHT THE MORE INTERESTING BIT WAS WHEN HE DISCUSSED MERGING ATMOBLACK WITH ELEMENTS OF THE MORE AGGRESSIVE STYLE THERE IS AN UNFORTUNATE TENDENCY FOR YOUR AVERAGE ATMOBLACK BANDS TO ERR TOWARDS DULL SAFE MELODIES AND SONG STRUCTURES MAKING FOR A BAD REPUTATION OVERALL THAT I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH DESPITE THE HAVING A MASSIVE CONCENTRATION OF MY FAVORITE BANDS
SHOULD BE MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER STILL THE BIT ABOUT SATAN BEING A GIMMICK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND WOULD BE MORE TRUE SENTENCE TO QUOTE THAN THE SENTENCE AFTER IT THIS HEADLINE


WELL THE EVANGELICALS EVENTUALLY WISED UP AND REALIZED THAT BY PICKETING SHOWS AND ACCUSING BANDS OF SNEAKING IN SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES THEY'RE JUST DRAWING MORE ATTENTION TO THE MUSIC THEY HATE SO MOST OF THEM ARE JUST SILENTLY IGNORING METAL WHICH IS WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE HASN'T BEEN A METAL ACT WHO CAUSED MAJOR CONTROVERSY IN AMERICA SINCE MARILYN MANSON
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY WHEN EVERYTHING IS REBELLIOUS OR CONTROVERSIAL IN THE END NOTHING IS REALLY REBELLIOUS OR CONTROVERSIAL
DELETED
I MEAN IN ALL FAIRNESS BANDS HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS SO OF COURSE IT'S GONNA GET OLD PRETTY SOON
I THOUGHT THE THEME OF BLACK METAL WAS JUST BEING DEPRESSED IN A SNOWY FOREST NOW
DOES IT HAVE TO BE
I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OFF AN AYREON CLIFF FOR A MONTH OR SO
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE UPCOMING ALBUM
MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MUSIC PROJECT ALL ALBUMS BY AYREON ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND AMAZING
DAMN THAT'S SOME GOOD STUFF HAVE EVERY ALBUM PLUS A SIGNED COPY OF THE GATHERING STORM WITH A T-SHIRT IT'S MY FAVORITE SHIRT LOL
REALLY ENJOYED THAT THANKS FOR POSTING IT
NEW SHIT LOMBARDO ON DRUMS FULL ALBUM WIKIPEDIA ABOUT THE ALBUM
BEEN ON A MASSIVE DISMEMBER KICK LATELY MOSTLY LIKE AN OVERFLOWING STREAM THOUGH THESE GUYS CAN RIFF AND HAVE POSSIBLY THE BEST GUITAR TONE IN SWEDEATH
AWESOME ALBUM AWESOME COVER ARTICLE CURRENTLY MY COMPUTER WALLPAPER GIVES ME A WARHAMMER VIBE YA DIG
TONS OF MELODY ON THIS RECORD I REMEMBER BUYING THE CASSETTE IN OR DEATH METAL WAS NO LONGER DANGEROUS THEN BUT DISMEMBER ALWAYS KEPT IT COOL AND
AH ONE OF MY FAVORITES FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS
I AM PRETTY SURE THAT EITHER RON JARZOMBEK OR DEVIN TOWNSEND ARE GOD
ABSOLUTELY CRUSHING CONSIDER ME HYPED FOR THE FULL-LENGTH
THIS BAND TRANSLATES BETTER LIVE FOR ME SAW THEM LAST NIGHT AND THEY WERE GREAT
ONE OF THE VERY VERY FEW MODERN CROSSOVER BANDS NEW MATERIAL IS EXTREMELY WELCOME
FUCK YEAH
THAT MAIN RIFF IS SO FUCKING GOOD

ALWAYS LOOKING FOR MORE SPEED METAL
I GET THE FEELING THAT SHE'S DONE WITH THE BAND NOW THAT THE LEGGINGS THING HAS TAKEN OFFICIAL
I'M LOVING THIS ALBUM
NICE ALBUM FURIA WILL HAVE A LIVE ALBUM COMING OUT NEXT SPRING AS WELL
THIS NEW ALBUM DOES SEEM MORE MELLOW THAN THEIR OTHER RELEASES I THINK
THANK YOU I LOVE HEARING METAL IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND THIS MUSIC IS BAD ASS
BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION IN ONE OF THE SELF PROMOTION THREADS A COUPLE MONTHS AGO

THE WHOLE LP IS FUN GREAT

CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR MORE OF THEM
THIS I LIKE
GENIAL COMME UNE ALBUM DE MAIDEN AEC EN FRANCAIS CA CE FAIT
BOUGHT THIS BEAUTY ON VINYL A FEW DAYS AGO AND CAN FINALLY CROSS IT OFF MY WANT LIST I LOVE THIS EP SO MUCH IT'S SO SPECIAL TO ME
SUMS UP THE POWER AND MELODY OF METAL IN ONE MINUTE PACKAGE
FOUND THESE GUYS LAST WEEK LOL THEY RULE
CHUCK FAVORITE BAND THEY'RE AWESOME
FOREVER KNOWN AS CHUCK FAVORITE BAND THANKS TO WIKIPEDIA
SUCH A WEIRD BAND MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OUT THEIR NEW STUFF TOO
DID THIS GET NO TRACTION WHEN IT CAME OUT IN I'M REALLY DIGGING THIS
PRETTY GOOD AND I REALLY DIG THE COVER ARTICLE
I'M NOT SURE I'VE HEARD BETTER ADRAMELECH WORSHIP THAN THIS
I CAN SEE THIS WORKING THE SAME WAY AS AVANTASIA SHOWS WORK SINGERS COME AND GO OFF STAGE ACCORDING TO THE SONGS THEY ARE PLAYING
I HAVE DREAMED OF THIS FOR YEARS SINCE I FIRST HEARD THE KEEPERS ALBUMS DREAMED OF THIS NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE

I'M SHAKING WITH HAPPINESS SHRIEKED WHEN I FOUND OUT LIKE A BOGYLAND FANGIRL THE DREAM IS REAL

AND IN CASE ANYONE HASN'T BEEN OBSESSIVELY FOLLOWING EVERY SINGLE STEP OF CAREER AND BUYING EVERY ALBUM HE'S GRACED YES HE CAN STILL HIT EVERY SINGLE NOTE FLAWLESSLY
THIS COULD BE SICK OR IT COULD BE TERRIBLE EITHER WAY IF GONNA BE ON VOCALS FOR ANY OF IT DOING STUFF OFF THE EP AND WALLS THEN I'M SOLD
DID NOT SEE THAT COMING
INCLUDING HANSEN FISKE AND WEIKATH I WANNA HAVE HOPE
REALISTICALLY WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FOR ANY U SOUTH LEG TWO CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S IT ONE EAST COAST AND ONE WEST COAST DATE OR MAYBE AT LEAST A FEW CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY

HOPEFULLY THEY'LL AT LEAST COME TO NYC LIKE AVANTASIA DID WHICH WILL MAKE THE SHOW DOABLE FOR ME
I'M SO FUCKING HYPED
CANDLEMAS HAS DONE SHOWS WITH ALL THEIR SINGERS A TOUR THOUGH THAT'S SOMETHING
I'LL BE JUMPING ON THIS NO DOUBT NOT THAT I REALLY KNOW MUCH OF THE NEWER SIDE OF THE BAND OR HOW THEY CHANGED WITH NEW MEMBERS AND ALL THAT
IT'S HAPPENING
DAMN KEEPERS I AND II WERE MY FIRST POWER METAL ALBUMS AND WALLS OF JERICHO IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SPEED METAL ALBUMS BEYOND PSYCHED
I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS HAPPY AND HOPEFUL FOR THE FUTURE SINCE THEY ANNOUNCED COMING TO THE MCU THAT INCLUDES MY KID BEING BORN
DARE I HOLD AN INKLING OF HOPE FOR A SHOW EVEN SOMEWHAT CLOSE TO NORTH CAROLINA
THIS IS GREAT I'VE BEEN WISHING HALLOWEEN WOULD DROP ALL THE KEEPERS STUFF FOR YEARS NOW AT LEAST I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE HALLOWEEN WITH DEBRIS SINGING MORE OF HIS OWN MATERIAL AND EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO HEAR THE OLD STUFF CAN HEAR THAT SOUNDING RIGHT
HALLOWEEN IS ONE OF MY FEW REMAINING BUCKET LIST BANDS I RARELY LISTEN TO THEM THESE DAYS BUT I SURE AS HELL HOPE THEY'RE PLAYING NEAR ME
MADE THE TREK TO SEE THEM IN A TINY CLUB IN NYC IN WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SEE THEM AGAIN HUGE FISKE SANDBOY HERE
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
THIS WILL BE EVEN BETTER THAN WACKEN WAS THAT YEAR HALLOWEEN PLAYED WITH ANDY KAI AND MICHEAL PLAYED LATER WHEN AVANTASIA TOOK STAGE AS SOMEONE WHO REALLY LIKES HALLOWEEN THAT WAS JUST KILLER BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE FUCKING AWESOME TOO
I'LL PROBABLY BE THERE IF IT COMES CLOSE AND ISN'T TOO EXPENSIVE
I'M GLAD PEOPLE ARE GETTING PSYCHED FOR ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY'LL SKIP OVER MY AREA

SO I GUESS THIS MEANS WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT A NEW HALLOWEEN UNIONIC OR GAMMA RAY ALBUM IN THE NEAR FUTURE
AH MASS PRODUCED CHEAP POWER METAL ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC ENJOY YOUR LONG HAIR EURO WANNABE ROCCO SIFFREDI CHUGGING THE E STRING OF HIS OVERPRICED SCRAT WITH HUMBUCKERS LIKE WHILE THE GOOFY LOOKING LEAD SINGER WITH ENOUGH HAIR GREASE TO DROWN A SMALL ANIMAL WAILS ON ABOUT DRAGONS FUCKING PONIES OR SOME GAY SHIT LIKE THAT



ME NOW I PREFER SOME QUALITY METAL BURTRUM AND BATORY WITH A SIDE OR CANDLEMAS WILL DO IT FOR ME BUT BY ALL MEANS KEEP UNVOTING YOUR TRASH FLOWER METAL HELPS ME DISTINGUISH THE SMART PEOPLE ON THIS SUB FROM THE DEGENERATES
ANYONE HAVE ANY TOPPING REQUESTS FOR THE POPCORN
THIS AND MAY THE HAMMER SMASH THE CROSS ARE TWO OF MY FAVOURITE POLISH BM ALBUMS OF ALL TIME GOOD SONG PICK TOO

SLAVES OF ADDICTIONS MONEY AND FAITH

COWARDS AND MORONS CREATURES WITHOUT HONOUR

I WILL NEVER AGREE WITH THE MYTH OF EQUALITY

I'M NOT A PART OF THIS WEAK HERD
THE BEST TORMENTOR SONG ALTHOUGH I HAVE A FEELING IT WAS POSTED QUITE RECENTLY

THE DISSECTION COVER ON THE NORDIC METAL TRIBUTE ALBUM IS GREAT TOO
THIS IS A STORY ABOUT ELISABET BATORY

HER BLOOD IS OURSELVES CLEAN HUNGARIAN BLOOD
I PREFER SONG ABOUT ELIZABETH BATORY
FFA INSECT WARFARE

I LOVE THIS BAND
IS THIS DANNY WALKERS FIRST BAND
I GOT SERENITY THROUGH WARFARE AS A BLIND BUY AT A RECORD STORE THAT HAD ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE OVERPRICED AS FUCK
GUYS AND GIRLS WHAT IF YOU HEALY WANTED IRON MAIDEN BUT COULD ONLY FIND THE RUSSIAN KNOCKOFF VERSION IN SOME SHADY OPEN AIR MARKET SURE IT LOOKS WEIRD AND IT IS PROBABLY SOLD BY SOME FUCKED UP LOOKING ELEPHANT HETP BUT THERE IS A CHARM IN ITS QUEST TO BE AN IMITATION BUT EMBRACES ITS UNIQUENESS WHAT IF YOU BOUGHT INTO THIS AND THE WHOLE THING WAS PRETTY AMAZING AND YOU DIDN'T CARE BECAUSE YOU FOUND THE WHOLE SOUND KINDA CAME TOGETHER INTO SOMETHING FRESH AND UNIQUE JUST BURIED BY TIME DO YOU WANT TO COMPLETE THIS TRANSACTION COMRADE

ARIA WOULD NOT BE WELCOME ON OUR UNDERGROUND FRIDAY IN FACT ARIA IS WORTH A LITTLE OVER BABUSHKAS IF WE ARE ILLUSTRATING THIS MATH PROBLEM WITH RUSSIAN METAL BANDS FOR HOWEVER MUCH YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE LISTENING TO THERE ARE LEGIONS OF PEOPLE WHO EITHER FOUND THIS OR PROBABLY JUST GREW UP WITH THIS SOUND IF YOU TRAVEL BACK THROUGH THIS S RECORDS YOU WILL NOT ONLY FIND ALBUMS DENSE WITH QUALITY BUT THEY ARE BANNERED BY SOME AMAZING ALBUM ART FULL OF MYSTERY AND WONDER

I HAVE A PASSION FOR BANDS AND ARTISTS WHO SING IN THEIR NATIVE TONGUE IT IS INTERESTING TO HEAR HOW OTHER LANGUAGES SOUND WHEN RUN THROUGH MACHINE OF POPULAR MUSIC THIS CAN LEAD TO SOME IDIOSYNCRATIC WONDERS THAT EITHER TRY TO REPLICATE WESTERN POP MUSIC OR MEET SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN TRANSLATED LYRICS ARE PRETTY TYPICAL WITH THIS ALBUM BEING HEAVILY CONCERNED WITH BIBLICAL THEMES THE DELIVERY HOWEVER WITH THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE IS DELIVERED WITH SUCH GRUFF STYLE AND GRACE OVER INSTRUMENTATION THAT IS NEAR FLAWLESS IN ITS DELIVERY

WHY ARE YOU LISTENING TO THIS TODAY WELL TO BE HONEST BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO BE IMPRESSED IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME HEARING IT IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY RETURNING IT TO THE OPEN AIR MARKET AND ASKING FOR YOUR MONEY BUT THE BIG SCARY RUSSIAN GUY SMOKING CIGARETTES AND GLARING AT YOU MIGHT PERSUADE YOU TO JUST BE HAPPY WITH IT ALSO THINK IN A COUPLE OF YEARS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT YOU GREW UP WITH SOMETHING THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ONLY HAD FEVER DREAMS ABOUT
LISTENING TO IT NOW SO ARE THESE GUYS LIKE RUSSIAN IRON MAIDEN OR SOMETHING
INTERESTING CHOICE TO SAY THE LEAST BUT I'M GLAD AT THIS PICK ARIA ARE STALWARTS IN THE RUSSIAN METAL SCENE AND VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY BUT THEY'VE MADE A LOT OF GREAT IRON TRAD METAL ONE OF THE BEST BANDS FROM THE SOVIET ERA I LIKE KRUTZ MORE THOUGH

EDIT ALSO ИГРА I ОГНЁМ IS PROBABLY MY AV FROM THEM
THIS WAS REALLY FUN I'LL BE LISTENING TO THEM AGAIN AND CHECKING OUT KRUTZ TOO
I KNOW I'VE RUN INTO THESE GUYS A COUPLE OF TIMES HERE BUT NEVER REALLY DUG IN

FUCK THIS ALBUM IS SO GOOD
DAMN THAT'S A PLEASANT SURPRISE
ARIA IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC AS WERE MANY OF THE FAIRLY UNKNOWN OUTSIDE OF RUSSIA METAL BANDS OF THE TIME PERIOD AT LEAST THAT I'VE HEARD ANYONE WANT TO RECOMMEND ME SOME MORE I HAVE SOME OTHER BIG NAMES BUT ASIDE FROM THOSE ASPIS AND КРЕДО I'M A BIT SPOTTY FIGURE EVEN IF I GET REPEATS THAT I ALREADY HAVE OTHER PEOPLE CAN USE THE ECCS
THANKS YOU REMINDED ME THAT I SHOULD LISTEN TO MORE THAN JUST МАНИЯ ВЕЛИЧИЯ AMAZING DEBUT BY THE WAY

WILL DEFINITELY BE GIVING THIS A FEW SPINS
OH HELL YES THIS IS MY FAVORITE АРИЯ ALBUM AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE NON-ENGLISH TRAD ALBUMS AS A WHOLE

I CANNOT THINK OF A MORE DESERVING ALBUM THIS WEEK
WOW THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT PICK I'VE NEVER HEARD THIS ALBUM BEFORE AND I JUST LISTENED TO IT TWICE TODAY AT WORK I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH DAMN GOOD CHOICE
I DISCOVERED ARIA WHILE BROWSING THE WORLD MUSIC SECTION AT BORDERS AGES AGO BAPTISM BY FIRE HAD AN AWESOME COVER SO I TOOK A CHANCE ON IT AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD GAMBLE THE DOWNSIDE WAS I HAD NO IDEA HOW TO LOOK FOR MORE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TYPE THE RUSSIAN CHARACTERS TO GOOGLE THEM AND DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE WHO COULD READ IT

BONUS THAT WORLD MUSIC SECTION ALSO GOT ME ANOTHER GREAT GAMBLE WITH AGO DE OZ ITS TOTALLY WORTH CHECKING THOSE SECTIONS OUT
ПРОЩАЙ НОРФОЛК INTRO SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG
GREAT CHOICE FOR AOW ARIA IS ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC RUSSIAN METAL BANDS AND THIS IS PROBABLY THEIR BEST ALBUM ВСЕ ЧТО БЫЛО WAS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE KARAOKE CHOICES WHEN I LIVED IN ST PETERSBURG JUST ANTHEMIA HAIR-RAISING VOCALS FROM VALERI KIPELOV WHO'S A VERY ACCOMPLISHED SINGER AROUND HOW CAN YOU NOT SING ALONG TO THIS

EDIT TITLE TRACK IS JUST INCREDIBLE TOO UP THERE WITH THE BEST MAIDEN EPICS INCLUDING MARCHING BASS LINES AND GORGEOUS TWIN GUITAR LEADS REALLY A CLASSIC TRAD ALBUM ALL AROUND
FUCK I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND BAND I GOT INTO THIS BAND AFTER I STARTED LEARNING RUSSIAN WANTED TO FIND RUSSIAN METAL BANDS TO IMMERSE MYSELF MORE INTO THE LANGUAGE
WHEN I WAS STUDYING RUSSIAN ARIA WAS ONE OF THE BANDS I LISTENED TO TRYING TO IMMERSE MYSELF IN THE LANGUAGE SUFFICE THE SAY I CAN'T SPEAK A SINGLE WORD OF RUSSIAN BUT I SURE DO LIKE ARIA

THEIR NEW LIVE ALBUM CLASSICAL ARIA КЛАССИЧЕСКАЯ АРИЯ HAS SOME OF MY FAVOURITE RENDITIONS OF SOME OF THEIR CLASSICS WHILE I LIKE THE ORIGINAL RECORDING OF TORERO THE LIVE PERFORMANCE WITH AN ORCHESTRA IS NOW MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE
I AM NOT UNDERSTANDING A WORD OFF THIS ALBUM BUT I AM ENJOYING IT NICE RECOMMEND
EVERY METALHEAD I'VE SPOKEN TO IN RUSSIA ABSOLUTELY HATES THIS BAND THEY SEE THEM AS A CHEAP KNOCKOFF OF IRON MAIDEN
THE GREATEST BLACK METAL BAND OF ALL TIME HANDS DOWN
SO JUST REAL QUICK ON HOW I AM JUDGING RESTRICTED BANDS ATLEAST ONES WITH DEEP DISCOGRAPHIES AS LONG AS THE SONG ISN'T IN A BANDS TOP

MUSIC BATORY TRACKS ALL

IT IS USUALLY FINE FOR BANDS WITH ONE OR TWO ALBUMS WELL WE NEED TO JUST USE SOME DUCT TAPE AND INGENUITY TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT
IF YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE ORIGINAL VINYL VERSION OF THIS ALBUM THE LEMASTERS OF BATORY AND UNDER THE SIGN OF THE BLACK MARK SOUND DIFFERENT BUT NOT NECESSARILY BETTER OR WORSE THE RETURN ON THE OTHER HAND SOUNDS WAY BETTER IN THE ORIGINAL FORMAT ESPECIALLY THE BASS DRUMS
LISTENED TO THE S T AND UNDER THE SIGN OF THE BLACK MARK SO FAR FOR EBBMAN GUESS I'LL BE LISTENING TO THE RETURN AS WELL
EVERYONE POSTING PICS OF THE SUPER MOON GOT ME THINKING ABOUT THIS ALBUM
VASEMMAN IS THE BEST
I WOULD QUITE LIKE TO SEE THESE GUYS LIVE HOPEFULLY SOMEDAY
I NEVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO THEM BEFORE VÄRÄHTELIJÄ BUT IT GOT ME TO CHECK OUT THEIR BACK CATALOG AND FIND THEIR SPLIT WITH CANDY CANE WHICH IS ALSO FUCKING AMAZING
SONG TITLE IS TRANSLATED SPRIGBONE IF SOMEONE IS INTERESTED
THIS HAS GOT MY VOTE FOR ALBUM OF THE YEAR
CORILLA TAVASTIAN
METAL BLADE SIGNS QUALITY BANDS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT I'LL HAVE TO CHECK THESE GUYS OUT
OKAY SO METAL BLADE HAS REVOCATION EVOCATION NEXT IS VOCATION AND SO FORTH
GREAT NEWS EVOCATION IS VERY UNDERRATED
THEY'VE GOT A SECOND ALBUM OUT RECENTLY PHYSICAL RELEASE COMING SOON
OH HEY A LOCAL BAND
I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM A LOT LATELY IT'S REALLY FUN
THESE GUYS SOUND LIKE THEY SHOULD BE TOURING WITH CAKY

UGH THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THEIR NAME GET A GOOD PRODUCER AND SELL MILLION ALBUMS SHOOT ME
I LIKE THE BAND BUT THIS WAS DISAPPOINTING DON T THINK I HOLD MUCH HOPE FOR THE FULL RELEASE UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES MY MIND

THAT S A NICE ALBUM COVER THOUGH
I SEE YOU'RE GIVING EXAMPLES FROM THAT MARE COGNITUM THREAD

READING THE TITLES ON THIS ALBUM BRING UP A LOT OF INTERESTING THOUGHTS WHEN I SEE SONG TITLES ABOUT MURDERING JESUS OR RAPING THE VIRGIN I DON'T BAT AN EYELASH THEN I SEE THESE AND I GET SENSITIVE EVEN THOUGH I'M VERY CRITICAL OF ISLAM I SEE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO OTHER THAN THAT IT IS FAR MORE ACCEPTABLE WHERE I LIVE TO CRITICIZE CHRISTIANITY THAN IT IS TO CRITICIZE ISLAM THANKS FOR POSTING SOMETHING TO GET ME THINKING
I WASN'T REALLY INTO THIS ALBUM NOT EVEN BASED ON THE THEMES I JUST DON'T THINK THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB WITH THE SONGWRITING I WOULD DEFINITELY RATHER HIT SCOLDER OR ADAT
MPH
THIS IS A REALLY GREAT ALBUM RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE BEST BLACK METAL THIS YEAR IMO
STILL RELEVANT ESPECIALLY IN THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CLIMATE
OPERATION MINDCRIME IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE CONCEPT ALBUMS EVEN THEIR NEW STUFF BAND MINUS TATE IS GREAT
GEOFF VOCALS ON THAT ALBUM WERE INSANE
I BET THEY WERE ABSOLUTE MURDER ON HIS THROAT
THAT WHOLE ALBUM IS A PROG MASTERPIECE
ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER MADE ME AND MY FRIENDS GOT SUPER STONED AND LISTENED TO IT IN OUR HOTEL ROOM AT CALIFORNIA DEATHFEST AND JUST HERDED OUT SUPER HARD WITH IT
I SAW THEM OPEN FOR JUDAS PRIEST ON THEIR ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION TOUR WHAT A GREAT BAND
I LIKE TO HEAR OLD SONGS LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY IF THE SONGS IS MADE BEFORE I WAS BORN
SHAME THEY WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS AFTER THE COURT PROCEEDINGS
OPERATION MINDCRIME IS STILL PROBABLY IN MY TOP ALBUMS OF ALL TIME
FIRST EP THE WARNING EVERYTHING ELSE
MY FAVOURITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME
TOP METAL ALBUM
I HAVE YET TO LISTEN THROUGH ALL OF IT AND I'VE TRIED THREE OR FOUR TIMES NOW JUST DOESN'T CLICK WITH ME AT ALL IT'S NOT THAT THE SONGS ARE BAD PER SE BUT BOY ARE THEY FORGETTABLE IT'S THE FACT THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE EACH SONG BLENDS INTO THE NEXT AND EVENTUALLY WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS A MESS WITH MIXING THAT DOES LITTLE TO NO JUSTICE TO THE INSTRUMENTATION THE VOCALS ARE A BIT NAGGY TO BOOT BECAUSE OF HOW THEY'RE PUT FORWARD IN THE MIX NOT TO MENTION SOME OF THE LYRICS YIKES
BLAH WHITE PEARL BLACK OCEANS PART II IS COOL THE FIRST IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONATA ARCTIA SONGS BUT THE REST IS REALLY FORGETTABLE
THIS HAS PROBABLY BEEN ASKED BEFORE BUT I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND ASK ANYWAY

HOW THE FUCK DO YOU FROUNCE THIS NAME
WHAT'S THE COLORFUL VERSION OF THE ALBUM ART ON THE VIDEO THUMBNAIL
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD ALL THE HYPE THAT THIS BAND GOT
I PREFER THE DEMO MUCH MORE
WOW THIS SOUNDS ALMOST ORCHESTRAL AT TIMES GREAT
SAW THESE GUYS OPEN FOR WATKIN AND MAYHEM THEY ABSOLUTELY KILLED IT I WASN'T INTO THEM AT THE TIME STILL KICKING MYSELF FOR NOT GRABBING ANY OF THEIR MERCH
YOU'RE WELCOME HAHA
IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND GODZILLA BLEEDING
THIS SHIT IS AWESOME
MAN I LOVE THIS ALBUM I FEEL LIKE IT OPENED UP TO ME OVER TIME TO REVEAL LITTLE EDDIES OF AND PUNK AND DEATH UNDERNEATH THE SHIMMER OF BLACK METAL
THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL ALBUM I GOT DOWNVOTED POSTING THIS EARLIER WHICH I KIIINDA GET IT'S HARD TO KEEP ON CALLING IT METAL BUT FUCK IT GREAT ALBUM
AWESOME ALBUM THE ATMOSPHERE IS GREAT IMO EASILY ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF THE YEAR
SWEET CLASSIC METAL I OUGHT TO EXPLORE MORE OF THEIR DISCOGRAPHY
LOUDNESS SHOW ME THE WAY LIVE

AKIRA TAKASAKI ALWAYS HAD SUCH A SICK GUITAR TONE

RIP MUNETAKA HIGUCHI
THE WHOLE OF THE LAW

GREAT ALBUM BY THE WAY
EASILY MY FAVORITE TRACK ON THE NEWEST RECORD THE VOCAL HARMONIES IN THE EARLIER PART OF THE SONG ARE JUST HAUNTING
TOP ARTY
REALLY ENJOYING THIS ALBUM IT FEELS SYMMETRICAL
LOVE THIS ONE AND BROKEN GROUND
GREAT TRACK THE VOCAL HARMONIES THE WAY IT ALL BREATHES AND THEN COLLAPSES ON ITSELF ALBINI IS A PERFECT FIT FOR THEM I KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS RECORD
I LIKE HOW THE SONG BREAKS DOWN TOWARDS THE END
THANKS FOR THIS FORGOT THIS ALBUM CAME OUT AND I'M REALLY ENJOYING IT BEEN A GREAT YEAR FOR METAL
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THEM AGAIN NEXT MONTH AT POWER OF THE RIFF FEST


I THINK THIS ALBUM IS SOMEWHERE IN MY TOP NEUROSIS ALBUMS I REALLY LIKE THEM ALL BUT I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THIS ONE
AS A BIG NEUROSIS FAN I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED BY THIS RECORD SADLY IT LACKS BOTH THE RAW EMOTIONAL POWER AND THE TEXTURES OF THEIR LATE S MATERIAL AND THE EXPERIMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS AND COMPOSITIONS OF RECORDS LIKE EYE OF EVERY STORM IT'S NOT A BAD RECORD BY AN STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION BUT IT'S A BIT UNDERWHELMING FROM A BAND THAT WE KNOW ARE CAPABLE OF SO MUCH MORE
THIS ALBUM WAS A LOT BETTER THAN I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASILY THEIR BEST ALBUM SINCE CHARACTER FICTION EAT A DICK IN FLAMES
GIVEN THE VOTES I THINK SHREDDING IS GETTING TIRED OF DARK TRANQUILLITY

MAN THEY ALWAYS START OFF THEIR ALBUMS WITH POWERFUL SONGS ENCIRCLED IS A REALLY GREAT DT TRACK I COULD SEE IT BECOMING A LIVE STAPLE
SAW THEM IN TORONTO LAST NIGHT HELL OF A SHOW
GREAT NEW ALBUM
GOOD TRACK SHOULD MAYBE CHECK OUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM
I LIKE THIS TRACK A LOT SEEING THEM LIVE IN A COUPLE WEEKS
SEEING THEM TONIGHT
EASILY MY FAVORITE SONG OFF OF THIS ALBUM AMORPHI ARE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST CONSISTENT BANDS IN TERMS OF QUALITY RELEASES
THE PRODUCTION KILLS THIS SONG FOR ME IT'S KIND OF SHOWCASING HOW TOO CLEAN OF A PRODUCTION JUST KILLS FEELING AND BRUTALITY

I MEAN IT COULD BE BETTER BUT IT'S STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE AMORPHI SONGS AND AMORPHI IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE BAND
I DISCOVERED THEM BECAUSE THEY OPENED FOR NIGHTFISH ALONG WITH ARCH ENEMY THEY WERE THE FIRST ACT AND WE WERE LATE SO I MISSED THEM IT SUCKS BECAUSE I REALLY ENDED UP LIKING THEIR STUDIO SHIT
I WAS GOING TO POST THIS SONG LAST WEEK BUT FORGOT THE MIX COULD USE SOME WORK BUT I THINK THE SONGWRITING IS SPECTACULAR MELODEATH DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THIS SONG
HE'S ALWAYS HAD THE BEST SINGERS JEFF SCOTT SOTO WAS A PERSONAL FAVORITE
MY FAVOURITE SONG ON THE ALBUM
ONE OF THE BETTER BLIND RECORDS I'VE BOUGHT
LOVE THIS RECORD
NECROSOPHUCKINGOOD
I ALWAYS GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN WHETHER THIS VERSION OR THE DEMO VERSION IS BETTER BUT THIS SONG IS A STANDOUT ON THE ALBUM FOR SURE
THIS IS AMAZING
THE SONG THAT GOT ME INTO DEATH METAL THANKS FOR POSTING THIS
THIS BAND NEVER CLICKED WITH ME ALWAYS SEEMED KINDA BORING
OH YEAH THIS ALBUM IS THE DEMONS TITS FUCKING LOVE IT

PEOPLE WHO ARE TIRED OF JERKING IT TO DISSECTION SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO NECROPHOBIC INSTEAD
THIS IS THE MOST EVIL ALBUM EVER WRITTEN
I HATE THE REISSUE ARTWORK FOR THIS ALBUM SO MUCH I'M LEGIT WILLING TO PAY THE CURRENT PRICES FOR A 1ST PRESS EDITION OTHER THAN THAT THIS ALBUM IS ABSOLUTELY KILLER
I RARELY SEE MUCH DISCUSSION OF THESE GUYS HERE SURPRISED TO SEE YOU POST THEM
GOEN IS GOD DAMN AWESOME
LOVE RETALIATE NOT A BAD TRACK ON IT THIS ALBUM ALMOST SINGLE HANDEDLY GOT ME INTO DEATH METAL TOTALLY UNRELENTING WITH AN ACTUAL MESSAGE BEHIND THE MUSIC
MISERY INDEX IS CONSISTENTLY WHAT A DEATH BAND SHOULD BE SOLID RELIABLE BUILT DEATH TOUGH
I'M PRETTY SURE MY FIRST BAND OPENED FOR THEM ABOUT YEARS AGO HOLY FUCK TIME FLIES I WAS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL
SPEAKING OF DIAMONDS
AMAZON LINK
GREAT ALBUM KINDA DOWNHILL FROM HERE
FUCK YEAH REALLY REALLY GOT CRAZY ABOUT THESE GUYS THIS SUMMER AFTER PICKING UP THE SPLIT WITH SATANIC BARMASTER
PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE CURRENTLY ACTIVE BAND I DO NOT COUNT SLAYER AS CURRENTLY ACTIVE
THESE GUYS CAME THROUGH MY AREA EARLIER THIS YEAR SOME ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING DEATH METAL MAN THEY KNOW HOW TO WRITE RIFFS
BACK IN THE DAY IF YOU SAW A CHRIS MOYEN COVER YOU KNEW IT WAS WORTH BUYING THE ALBUM OR EPISTLE


THIS HAS BEEN REPRESSED ON VINYL AND CD HERE'S A STORE LINK
NEVER HEARD THIS SONG BEFORE
ONE OF THE FIRST CARCASS SONGS I HEARD BELIEVE IT OR NOT
EVERY TIME THESE GUYS GET POSTED I REMEMBER HOW AMAZING THEY WERE LIVE
DOES ANYBODY KNOW ANY BANDS THAT SOUND SIMILAR TO TAU CROSS I HAVEN'T REALLY LISTENED TO ANYTHING THAT FITS THEIR SOUND
GOT A BUDDY WHO PLAYS WITH ONE OF THE DUDES IN THIS BAND
THEY HAD A TAPE AVAILABLE BUT NOW THE ONLY WAY TO BUY THIS IS DIGITALLY

HERE'S THEIR BANDCAMP THOUGH THIS IS A LINK TO PART OF THE BANDCAMP PAGE ANYWAY SO WHATEVER
ODD CHOICE FOR A BAND NAME I COULD SEE IT WORKING FOR SOMETHING LIKE CRUST PUNK RAW BLACK BUT THIS JUST SOUNDS LIKE ANY OTHER NAME COULD BE BETTER
SUCH A KILLER ALBUM LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
ONE OF THE BETTER BLIND RECORD BUYS THAT I'VE EVER MADE
THAT IS ONE CONFUSING TITLE
LOL THESE BAND NAMES CRACK ME UP I SHOULD START MAKING A LIST

LOVE THIS ALBUM
SPIT OUT THE BONE IS THE BEST TRACK THE BAND HAVE DONE SINCE THE AND JUSTICE FOR ALL ALBUM GOOD GOD I DIDN'T KNOW THEY STILL HAD THAT IN THEM
WELL THAT WAS AN AWESOME MINUTES I'M HAPPY AS HELL WITH THIS ALBUM I LOVED DEATH MAGNETIC BUT IT WAS A LITTLE I DON'T KNOW IT FELT LIKE THEY RE RECORDED B SIDES FROM OLDER ALBUMS FOR DEATH MAGNETIC BUT THIS ALBUM HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE SOUND AND THAT SOUND HAPPENS TO BE GREAT
I ALSO DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING IN THE RULES ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE AWARE OF A LEAK

THAT'S FINE YOU JUST CAN'T POST LINKS TO THE LEAK
HERE'S A VERY LONG REVIEW I WROTE FOR THE METALLICA SUB

EXCELLENT ALBUM DESPITE A COUPLE OF TRACKS

THERE'S CERTAINLY A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE SONG WRITING THE ALBUM FEATURES A LOT OF HARMONISED GUITAR MELODIES ESPECIALLY ON TRACKS SUCH AS MOTH INTO FLAME ATLAS RISE AND SPIT OUT THE BONE I CAN SEE WHY SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DRAWING COMPARISONS TO IRON MAIDEN ALTHOUGH I THINK THE SIMILARITIES ARE TENUOUS AT BEST

I'M A FAN OF THE RETURN OF THE BIG GROOVY MINUS HUMAN STYLE RIFFS I'M SURPRISED AM I SAVAGE ISN'T GETTING MORE LOVE THE MAIN RIFF AND THE RIFF AT ARE FUCKING MASSIVE DREAM NO MORE ALSO HAS BIG SLABS OF GROOVE METAL AND HEAVY CHUGGING THROUGHOUT

A COUPLE OF THE SONGS HAVE A LOT GOING ON AND MIGHT TAKE A FEW LISTENS TO FULLY APPRECIATE HALO OF FIRE WASN'T THE CLASSIC METALLICA POWER BALLAD I HOPED IT WOULD BE THERE ARE NO BALLADS ON THE RECORD BUT ON REPEAT LISTENS I THINK IT MIGHT BE ONE OF OF THE BEST ON THE ALBUM AFTER THE SECOND CHORUS THE SONG BREAKS OFF INTO A FEW DIFFERENT SECTIONS BEFORE AN ABSOLUTELY EPIC FINALE IT'S OUTSTANDING BUT MIGHT TAKE A FEW PLAY THROUGHS TO FULLY GET INTO

SPIT OUT THE BONE STARTS OFF IN SIMILAR VEIN TO THE TITLE TRACK PURE THRASH BEFORE DIVERTING OFF INTO AN ARRAY OF GUITAR SOLOS DUAL GUITAR MELODIES AND EVEN A SMALL BASS SOLO THE SONG MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE BLOATED AND OVER-LONG AT FIRST BUT IT'S A FUCKING MONSTER OF A METAL SONG I'M GLAD THE BOYS ARE STILL CAPABLE OF THIS SORT OF THING AFTER OVER YEARS OF PLAYING TOGETHER

NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD FIT COMFORTABLY ON THE BLACK ALBUM OR LOAD IT'S STOMPER WITH A SIMPLE ENOUGH STRUCTURE AND WHILE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT IT'S NOT EXACTLY THEIR BEST WORK IT'S NOT A SONG TO SKIP PAST BUT NOT ONE YOU'D BE EXCITED ABOUT HEARING LIVE

THERE'S NO REAL NEED TO SAY MUCH ABOUT THE TITLE TRACK MOTH INTO FLAME OR ATLAS RISE MOTH MIGHT BE THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM AND ONE OF THE BEST THEY'VE DONE IN MANY YEARS HARDWIRED IS A KILLER AND CONCISE THRASH ATTACK AND ATLAS RISE WHILE PERHAPS THE WEAKEST OF THE THREE SINGLES IS STILL AN EXCELLENT SONG THAT SEES THE GUYS SHOWING OFF THEIR ABILITY TO PUT TOGETHER SONGS WITH COMPLEX STRUCTURES THAT STILL PACK A PUNCH

UNFORTUNATELY THE RUMOURS ARE TRUE THE SECOND DISC IS QUITE WEAK ON THE WHOLE MANUNKIND HAS SOME COOL BLUESY RIFFS BUT THE VOCAL MELODIES ARE AND THE SONG JUST ISN'T UP THE USUAL HIGH STANDARD

SAME GOES FOR CONFUSION IT'S A CHUGGATHON THAT GOES ABSOLUTELY NO WHERE FAST AND DESPITE A FEW RIFFS IT'S ENTIRELY FORGETTABLE HERE COMES REVENGE SUFFERS FROM SOME CRINGE LYRICS REVENNNGE YOU ASK FOR FORGIVENESS BUT I GIVE YOU REVENNNGE AND DOESN'T OFFER ANY CHANGE OF PACE
THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT HAS TO BE MURDER ONE HOW CAN A SONG ABOUT FUCKING LEMMY SOUND SO UNINSPIRED IT'S A YET ANOTHER ROCKER THAT OFFERS NO GLIMPSE OR SPARK OF WHAT MADE MOORHEAD SO GREAT I DOUBT THIS SONG WOULD HAVE EVEN MADE THE CUT FOR RELOAD FOR FUCKS SAKE

ALL THAT ASIDE THE FIRST DISC IS A WITH FOUR EXCELLENT SONGS AND TWO VERY GOOD ONES NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD AND DREAM NO MORE THE SECOND DISC IS A WITH AN EXCELLENT SONG IN SPIT OUT THE BONE AND A VERY GOOD SONG WITH AM I SAVAGE

I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE ALBUM ALL DAY AND AS A FAN I REALLY AM LOVING IT EVEN THE MEDIOCRE SONGS ARE STILL BETTER THAN WHAT MOST BANDS ARE PUTTING OUT THESE DAYS

TO CONCLUDE MY RAMBLING DIATRIBE I WANT TO SAY A BIT ABOUT KIRK HE NEEDS TO STEP UP HIS GAME BIG TIME HIS PARTS ON THIS ALBUM ARE PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAME VERSIONS OF DRENCHED BLUESY SOLOS IN E MINOR HE'S BEEN DOING SINCE WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GUY WHO WROTE THE SOLOS TO ONE AND THE UNFORGIVEN ON ATLAS RISE HE EVEN REPEATS PART OF HIS SOLO FROM SUICIDE AND REDEMPTION IT JUST SEEMS LAZY IT'S JAMES WHO WRITES ALL THE MELODIC LEAD GUITAR PARTS SO CAN'T EVEN TAKE CREDIT FOR THOSE PLUS HIS EXCUSE FOR HAVING NO CREDITS ON THE ALBUM IS I LOST MY PHONE HOW DOES THAT FLY YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE MUDSTAIN WOULD FIRE WHOEVER THE MEGADEATH GUITAR PLAYER OF THE WEEK IS FOR THAT BULLSHIT
EDITED FOR GRAMMAR
WOW PIRATING A NEW METALLICA ALBUM STILL MAKES ME GIGGLE EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

SUCK MY BALLS LARS I MAY EVEN SEED THIS TOO

EDIT GEEZ IT'S ACTUALLY
I GENUINELY THINK THIS IS REALLY REALLY COOL NOT GOOD FOR METALLICA IN OR AT LEAST THEY'RE HEAVY AGAIN I GENUINELY ENJOY THIS AND SEE IT BEING SPUN A FAIR AMOUNT


IT'S KINDA LIKE BLACK ALBUM LOAD AND AFA BEING PUT INTO A BLENDER I LIKE IT
THERE ARE OR SONGS OUT OF THE ON HERE THAT ARE REALLY GOOD WOULDN'T EVEN CALL THE REST BAD JUST THAT I DON'T CARE FOR THEM I'M HAPPY THESE GUYS CAN STILL PUT OUT QUALITY MUSIC REALLY SOLID RECORD IMO
I DONT KNOW ABOUT THESE SUPER SPECIFIC ENGINEERING AND PRODUCTION COMPLAINTS BUT MUSICALLY AS A LONG TIME METALLICA FAN AND GUITARIST OF YEARS DEATH MAGNETIC WAS A HARD FUCKING ALBUM THEY STILL HAD IT THEN AND AFTER HEARING THIS ALBUM I SEE THEY STILL HAVE IT NOW

MY CRITICISM OF THIS ALBUM MUSICALLY IS KIRK MAN WHAT I WOULD GIVE TO HEAR THE EARLY KIRK SOLO OVER THESE SONGS ESPECIALLY SPIT OUT THE BONE JAMES IS ON POINT SPEED IS THERE DYNAMICS ARE THERE PRETTY VERSATILE ALBUM I HEARD TASTES OF EVERY ALBUM EXCEPT JUSTICE AND ST ANGER IN HERE ON MY FIRST LISTEN THROUGH AND IM SURE THEY'RE IN THERE TOO VERY SATISFIED

LONG LIVE METALLICA M
HOLY SHIT JAMES SOUNDS VICIOUS ON SPIT OUT THE BONE THIS IS GREAT
BEST THEY'VE DONE IN YEARS GUARANTEED PURCHASE GREAT ALBUM
NICE I REALLY REALLY LIKE BOTH ATLAS RISE AND MOTH INTO FLAME SO I'M EXCITED FOR THE REST OF THE ALBUM
COMPLETELY AGREE PROBABLY THE BEST THING THEY'VE DONE SINCE THE BLACK ALBUM SPIT OUT THE BONE STICKS OUT AS MY FAVORITE TRACK IT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE ON KILL EM ALL
I'M LESS THAN IMPRESSED WITH THIS IT'S ABOUT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING DECENT BUT NOT REALLY WORTH MULTIPLE LISTENS WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH GREAT STUFF BEING MADE ELSEWHERE SPIT OUT THE BONE IS DEFINITELY THEIR BEST TRACK IN YEARS THOUGH I WILL SAY THAT

IF YOU LIKE MODERN METALLICA YOU'LL LOVE THIS IF NOT THIS SURE AS SHIT ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE YOUR MIND
I FEEL LIKE MOST OF THE SECOND DISC COULD HAVE BEEN OMITTED A DIRTY TRACK ALBUM LIKE MASTER OF PUPPETS COULD HAVE BEEN SICK
HARDWIRED
ATLAS RISE
NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD
MOTH INTO FLAME
DREAM NO MORE
HALO ON FIRE
AM I SAVAGE
SPIT OUT THE BONE
SOME PEOPLE GET PRETTY BENT OUT OF SHAPE ABOUT LISTENING TO LEAKS BUT I USUALLY DO IT IF THERE'S AN ALBUM I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD SO FAR I'M A FAN OF DEATH MAGNETIC SUE ME AND I'M NOT SURE YET WHETHER I LIKE THIS ONE BETTER BUT IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS BETTER IF THAT MAKES SENSE
LEGITIMATE QUESTION BECAUSE I'VE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD HOW EXACTLY DO ALBUMS GET LEAKED I SEE ALBUMS GET LEAKED ALL THE TIME BUT HAVE NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT MEANS
THIS SHIT IS FUCKING AMAZING BEST ALBUM SINCE THE BLACK ALBUM
THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM THE SONGS SOUND WAY MORE COHESIVE THAN DEATH MAGNETIC WHICH HAD SOME REALLY WONKY TRANSITIONS THAT DIDN'T REALLY FIT JAMES SOUNDS THE BEST HE HAS IN YEARS AND KIRK ACTUALLY HAS SOME REALLY MEMORABLE SOLOS AND MELODY LINES THAT AREN'T WAH DRENCHED SO STOKED ON THIS
THE ALBUM IS SOLID EXCEPT FOR LARS LIKE USUAL HARDWIRED AND MOTH TO FLAME BECKON FOR MORE DOUBLE BASS TRIPLETS DECENT ROLLS BLAST BEATS ETC INSTEAD WE GET THE SAME SHITTY PERFORMANCE ULRICH IT'S A SHAME REALLY BECAUSE IF HE WOULD JUST PRACTICE AND LEARN FROM A NUMBER DRUMMERS WHO HAVE OFFERED THIS ALBUM WOULD BE FANTASTIC
LARS GETS SO MUCH SHIT BUT HE IS FAR FROM THE WORST DRUMMER SO I'M REALLY CONFUSED HOW NO ONE IN THE BAND HAS ASKED HIM TO DRUM TO COME UP WITH A DRUM FILL THAT'S NOT SIMPLY A SNARE ROLL OF SOME SORT DUDE HAS A HARD ON FOR HIS SNARE ROLLS
DREAM NO MORE IS A BEAST IT'S ALMOST TEETERING ON THE EDGE OF DOOM METAL AND THAT JAM TOWARDS THE END OF HALO ON FIRE IS JUST SO FUCKING COOL

I REALLY ENJOY THE SONGS ON SIDE 2 ON THEIR OWN BUT THEY PUT TOO MANY SONG THAT ARE PACED SIMILARLY TOGETHER AND IT MAKES THE ALBUM PLOD ALONG UNTIL SPIT OUT THE BONE GODDAMN WHAT A TRACK

I'M REALLY REALLY ENJOYING THIS ALBUM WE'LL SEE HOW IT HOLDS UP OVER TIME STAYING POWER IS THE MARK OF A GREAT ALBUM

IT'S NICE BEING EXCITED ABOUT METALLICA AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LONG FUCKING TIME SINCE I HAVE BEEN
SOUNDS PRETTY DECENT JAMES SOUNDS BETTER THAN HE HAS IN A WHILE KIRK IS PLAYING SOLOS AGAIN THAT DEFINITELY SOUND LIKE HIM BUT WITH A FEW SMALL TWISTS HERE AND THERE THE SONGWRITING IS MUCH BETTER

NO IT ISN'T MY NEW FAVORITE ALBUM OR ANYTHING BUT I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS SO FAR CONSIDERING HOW FAR METALLICA HAS FALLEN AND THIS IS A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I COULD SEE MYSELF LISTENING TO TRACKS FROM THIS PERIODICALLY

MY ONLY MAJOR COMPLAINTS

PERHAPS THIS IS JUST THE SHITTY MATCHBOOK SPEAKERS THAT ARE ALL I HAVE LISTENED THROUGH SO FAR THE BASS DRUM SOUND IS ANNOYING IT SOUNDS ARTIFICIAL IT SOUNDS ALMOST LIKE IT IS TRIGGERED AND I ABSOLUTE HATE TRIGGERED DRUM SOUNDS HAD TO STOP LISTENING TO A LOT OF DEATH METAL BECAUSE IF I HEARD ONE MORE TRIGGERED BLAST BEAT OR DOUBLE BASS BEAT I WAS GOING TO PUKE

LARS I HATE TO JUMP ON THE LARS SUCKS BANDWAGON BUT A REALLY GOOD DRUMMER WOULD BE ABLE TO ADD A LOT TO THIS ALBUM HE ONLY PLAYS REALLY SIMPLE BEATS AND ALMOST ALL OF HIS FILLS ARE DONE ON THE SNARE DRUM EXCLUSIVELY THIS SORT OF WORKS ON SUPER FAST THRASH SONGS THAT ARE ALL ABOUT ENERGY ANYWAYS BUT WHEN THE TEMPO SLOWS DOWN IT JUST FEELS LAZY LIKE HE WAS LAYING DOWN A TO PIECE THE SONG TOGETHER BUT NEVER IT WITH THE REAL FILLS AND BEATS IN WHENEVER THE RHYTHM DOES SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY LARS SEEMS TO JUST HIT THE SNARE WITH WHAT JAMES IS SINGING INSTEAD OF FIGURING OUT WHAT HE CAN PLAY OVER THE SECTION A BETTER THRASH DRUMMER WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE AND ON THE SOME OF THE SLOWER SECTIONS A MORE VERSATILE METAL DRUMMER COULD HAVE DONE SOME REALLY COOL THINGS TOO LIKE A BILL WARD SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS HOW TO WORK THE KIT AND CAN KEEP TIME AND DO COMPLEX FILLS EVEN IN TRANSITIONAL SECTIONS

OH WELL IM NOT TRYING TO SHIT ON IT I AM PLEASED WITH WHAT I HAVE HEARD SO FAR AND WILL ACTUALLY GIVE METALLICA MY MONEY ONCE IT COMES OUT AS A REWARD FOR WRITING HALFWAY DECENT MUSIC AGAIN I REALLY FEEL LIKE JAMES WAS ON FOR THIS ALBUM IN A WAY HE HASN'T BEEN IN A WHILE
THE PRODUCTION ON THIS ALBUM IS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL
THERE ARE SOME MOMENTS FROM BLACK ALBUM AFA MOP LOAD SHORTLY THEIR THING THEY EVER DONE SINCE GARAGE
I'M REALLY IMPRESSED BY THIS ALBUM IT'S GOOD FOR ANY STANDARD IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST HONESTLY ANYTHING ELSE THEY EVER DO WONT BE HOWEVER I REALLY THINK THIS IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE THEY'VE DONE
AFTER HEARING IT ALL U CAN THINK IS HOW GOOD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AS A HATFIELD SOLO ALBUM THE SONGS ARE GREAT JUST BROUGHT DOWN BY THE MOST UNIMAGINATIVE BORING DRUMMING POSSIBLE AND LACKLUSTER LEAD WORK IF IT WAS JAMES WITH GUEST MUSICIANS IT WOULD BE AMAZING
JAMES STILL KICKING STRONG

KIRK STILL CRANKING OUT KILLER SOLOS WITH GREAT AND CLASSIC METALLICA TONE

ROB STILL HIGHLY OVERLOOKED AND PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL BE SAD CONSIDERING HOW MUCH A COOL DUDE AND GREAT BASS PLAYER HE IS

AND OF COURSE LARS REALLY ODD TO SEE SUCH A PROLIFIC BAND LIKE METALLICA MISSING WHAT IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF A REALLY GOOD ROCK BAND NOT JUST METAL I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT WHEN DRUMMERS AGE THEY SHOW THEIR AGE CLEARER THAN ANY OTHER INSTRUMENT IN THAT IT'S ALMOST PURE PHYSICAL EXERTION


OVERALL I FEEL LIKE IT ALL SOUNDS VERY COHESIVE BUT ALSO PRODUCED OUT THE BAZOO BUT WHAT ISNT THESE DAYS PROBABLY WORTH NOTING SIRIUS M HAS OVERPLAYED THE ALBUM SO MUCH BY THIS POINT IT'S MAKIN ME SICK
I'D SAY IT'S A ALBUM FOR ME THE FIRST HALF OF DISC TWO IS ALL FILLER BUT I HONESTLY THINK THEY'VE DONE THEMSELVES JUSTICE ON THIS ALBUM AND NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD MOTH INTO FLAME AND SPIT OUT THE BONE ARE SOME CLASSIC METALLICA TUNES

KINDA LIKE STAR WARS EPISTLE VII IT DOESN'T LIVE UP TO THE CLASSICS BUT IT RECAPTURES THE MAGIC FOR A LITTLE BIT I'M SATISFIED AND EXCITED FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN TOUR
I CANT HELP BUT THINK THE DRUMS ARE WAY TOO LOUD AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR MY TASTES IN THE LAST 2 ALBUMS ALSO I ALSO WISH THEY'D FOCUS ON ROBERT TRUJILLO A LITTLE MORE
I AM REALLY PLEASED BY THIS ALBUM DIDN'T LIKE THE SINGLES ALL THAT MUCH EXCEPT FOR ATLAS RISE SO I'M GLAD THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE WEAKER TRACKS ON THIS HERE COMES REVENGE AND NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD AREN'T GREAT BITER ESPECIALLY HCR WHICH MIGHT AS WELL BE THE WORST ON THE ALBUM

THERE'S A COUPLE OF REALLY COOL TRACKS NOT TOO MEMORABLE BUT COOL NONETHELESS SUCH AS MANUNKIND MURDER ONE CONFUSION AND AM I SAVAGE AND ABSOLUTELY IN MY OPINION KILLER SONGS WHICH ARE DREAM NO MORE SPIT OUT THE BONE AND HALO ON FIRE
THE FIRST BEING PROBABLY MY FAVOURITE WITH ITS MENACING BROODING RIFFS AND REALLY AWESOME LYRICS SPIT OUT THE BONE LITERALLY SOUNDS LIKE PRE TBA METALLICA AND WOULD FIT ONTO ANY OF THESE ALBUMS WITHOUT HAVING TO BE ASHAMED OF ANYTHING GREAT VOCALS AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE SECOND HALF HALO ON FIRE IS A GREAT SONG TOO AND COULD EASILY BE THE TRUE FOLLOWUP TO UNFORGIVEN BEING A BETTER SONG THAN BOTH II AND III

OVERALL THE ALBUM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED ME AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE CASE WITH MOST METALLICA FANS WHICH I'M NOT THAT MUCH OF BUT I WAS REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT THIS ALBUM AND IF YOU CUT OF THE WEAKEST TRACKS HARDWIRED MOTH INTO FLAME HERE COMES REVENGE AND NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD POSSIBLY EVEN A
I'LL WAIT UNTIL I CAN GET A HOLD OF A PHYSICAL COPY IF ONLY BECAUSE I'M A COMPUTER BOOB AND DON'T KNOW HOW CARE TO DOWNLOAD THINGS THAT BEING SAID I'M PUMPED TO HEAR SPIT OUT THE BONE BASED ON EVERYONE'S REACTION TO IT
DON'T FORGET TO BUY IT GUYS
AND IT IS ACTUALLY WAY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
I'VE LISTENED TO OUT OF THE TRACKS SEVERAL DOZEN TIMES REVENGE IS A TRACK I AM WARMING UP TO SO I WILL PROBABLY START LISTENING TO IT MORE I AM NOT DIGGING MURDER ONE BUT I WILL GIVE IT A SHOT DOWN THE LINE MY FAVORITE TRACK RIGHT NOW AND OBVIOUSLY THIS CAN CHANGE IS CONFUSION IT WAS A SONG I AT FIRST KIND OF DIDN'T FEEL BUT THE MORE I LISTENED THE MORE I FELL FOR IT ALSO THE LYRICS ARE REALLY GOOD AS JAMES GETS INTO SOME SOLID PTSD ISSUES
I DOWNLOADED IT TWICE JUST TO SHOVE IT UP ASS HALACHA
I REALLY LOVE HALO ON FIRE TO ME IT S LIKE A MIX BETWEEN UNFORGIVEN AND MAYBE ONE
CAN'T WAIT TO LISTEN TO THE ALBUM I REALLY LIKE MOTH INTO FLAME DAT SOLO DATUM HOPE THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS ON PAR
I'M SURE I'D LIKE IT IF I GAVE IT A CHANCE BUT I LISTENED TO IT DIRECTLY AFTER THE VIOLENT SLEEP OF REASON IT'S A BIT HARD TO DIAL IT BACK A BIT AFTER THAT
GOOD TO HEAR I'VE THE ALBUM AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE TRACKS
I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THIS ALBUM I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS FINALLY I LIKE IT CAN'T WAIT TO PICK IT UP ON FRIDAY
YEAH PEOPLE TEND TO DUMP ON ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE SAME AS THE OLD STUFF COME ON LET'S BE REAL IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO MAKE ANYTHING FEEL LIKE THAT AGAIN EVEN IF AGE AND SUCH WERE A CONSTANT BUT I'VE QUITE LIKED THIS ALBUM SO FAR I'M SURE I'M GOING TO LISTEN TO IT MORE THAN DEATH MAGNETIC
THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME I HAD HIGH HOPES AND THEY DIDN'T DISAPPOINT BRING ON THE TOUR
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY FOR SURE IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE I LISTEN TO A METALLICA ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END ENJOYED THE COUPLE OF INTRODUCTORY TRACKS EVEN IF I DON'T SEE MYSELF REVISITING THEM EVER AGAIN

ANYWAY I CELEBRATE THE CHANGE IN VOICE WHICH WAS THE MOST OBNOXIOUS THING FOR ME IN THE RECORDS
HATFIELD ON VOCALS AND THE BAND ITSELF SHOWED A LITTLE RANGE WHICH WAS NICE
WELL I THE DELUXE VERSION SO THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH LOOKING INTO THIS
SO MANY RIFFS
WELL I'VE LISTENED TO THE WHOLE THING A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW SOME OF THE SONGS HAVE A LOAD RELOAD VIBE WHICH I ACTUALLY LIKE FLAME ON BUT MOSTLY IT'S PRETTY BORING RIFFING JUST ISN'T THAT GOOD ANYMORE IT'S LIKE THE KIND OF STUFF YOU COME UP WITH WHILE YOU'RE NOODLING AROUND IN YOUR ROOM OR WHATEVER IT ISN'T BAD IT JUST ISN'T THAT GOOD EITHER IT'S DECENT IF BLAND

BUT I'LL KEEP LISTENING TO IT AND SEE HOW IT GROWS ON ME
I KNOW IT'S PRETTY COMMON TO SHIT ON METALLICA THESE DAYS AND I HATE TO BE THAT GUY BUT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING SPECTACULAR ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS IT TIMES BETTER THAN ANYTHING ON STREET ANGER SURE DOES IT HAVE MORE BALLS THAN ANYTHING ON THE LOAD ALBUMS ABSOLUTELY DOES THAT MEAN THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST THING METALLICA HAS DONE SINCE JUSTICE NOT REALLY BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
IT'S TRUE THAT LARS LOVES THE SMELL OF HIS OWN FARTS WHAT GETS ME ABOUT THIS ALBUM SO FAR IS THAT IT IS IN YOUR FACE MUCH LIKE THE OLD STUFF I HEAR A LOT OF KILL EM ALL ESPECIALLY IN HARDWIRED THE BAND SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE FUCKING KILLING IT EXCEPT LARS NO COMPLEXITY THAT SHITTY SNARE ROLL HIS OFF BEAT KICK DRUM AND THE FACT THAT HE'S NOT IN TIME
I'M JUST ON MY THIRD AND I LIKE HARDWIRED A LOT THE PRODUCTION IS GOOD THE SONGS ARE ON POINT AND YOU CAN CLEARLY HEAR THEY'VE REVISITED THE OLD ALBUMS CATCHY RIFFING ALL AROUND TOO WHICH SHOULD WORK WELL IN A LIVE SETTING AND JAMES VOCALS SOUND GREAT MY ONLY CRITICISM IS THAT THE ALBUM IS PERHAPS SOMEWHAT TOO LONG TWO OR THREE SONGS LESS WOULD HAVE WORKED JUST AS WELL I THINK
DOES NOW THAT WE'RE DEAD GIVE OFF A NO MORE TEARS VIBE FOR ANYONE ELSE
COOL WILL GIVE IT A LISTEN I ACTUALLY ENJOYED DEATH MAGNETIC SO SOUNDS LIKE THIS WILL BE AS GOOD OR BETTER
I QUITE LIKE IT SPIT OUT THE BONE IS OBVIOUSLY THE SINCE IT SEEMS THE ONLY SONG THAT HARKENS BACK TO THE OLDER MATERIAL

BUT ALL IN ALL IT'S PRETTY OK NOTHING FANTASTIC THOUGH
I'M HALFWAY THROUGH IT SO FAR AND LOVING IT SO FAR CONFUSION IS BEST FOR ME

DDK WHERE TO GET IT
THEY NEED TO STOP SENDING EARLY COPIES TO MUSTAIN HE DOES THIS EVERY TIME
FUCK IF THEY COULD ONLY MIX THIS ALBUM SIMILAR TO MASTER OR JUSTICE WITH BASS IT'D BE GREAT NOT A FAN OF THE DRUMS
ANYONE ELSE BE SATISFIED WITH THE ALBUM AS IS BUT JUST WISH JAMES VOCALS HAD THAT OLD REVERB
I SWEAR I CAN'T FIND THE ALBUM ANYWHERE AM I BEING TRICKED CAN SOMEONE SEND ME A LINK TO WHERE I CAN LISTEN
LOOKS AROUND

WHO THE FUCK ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
IT'S MPH THE NEW TESTAMENT THOUGH BAD ASS
I'M GONNA TRY MY DAMNEDEST TO NOT LISTEN TO IT UNTIL I GET MY COPY
YEAH VOICE IS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN IT'S BEEN IN AWHILE I THINK IT BEEN A MORE SOLID ALBUM IF LARS BEEN REPLACED WITH A BETTER DRUMMER I JUST WISH LARS WOULD JUST TAKE OFF SO TALLIA CAN GRAB LOMBARDO I GUESS
HUGE FAN OF CD AND THEN THE LAST TWO TRACKS ON THE SECOND DISCOURSE I'M LOVING THE VARIETY THEY BROUGHT TOO I HEAR A LITTLE BIT FROM CLOSE TO EVERY ALBUM IN THERE
CONFUSION ALL SANITY IS NOW BEYOND ME
DAMN BLUH THIS ALBUM IS RAD DOPE BLUH AFTER LULU I THOUGHT THIS GUYS WERE DONE BUT THEY JUST ARMIN UP BLUH SPIT OUT THE BONE IS RADICAL
REMOVED
I'M JUST HERE TO SEE EVERYONE JUMP ON THE LARS SUCKS BANDWAGON
IT'S FUNNY HOW EVERYONE TALKS SO MUCH TRASH ABOUT THE GUY WHO'S BEEN DRUMMER IN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BANDS IN THE WORLD FOR THE PAST YEARS
I THINK IT STEMS FROM LACK OF SUCCESS ON THEIR OWN PART AND JEALOUSY IT'S OKAY BOYS YOU'LL BREAK OUT OF MOMMY AND GARAGE SOME DAY
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS BUT THE ALBUM IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS I'VE HEARD ALL YEAR SO DRY SO LAZY SO SHITTY THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF PUTTING THAT PIECE OF SHIT OUT FOR MONEY TERRIBLE
I ORDERED THE DELUXE EDITION

NOT REALLY RELEVANT BUT AT LEAST I'M SEEING A LOT OF POSITIVITY
JUST GIVING IT A FIRST LISTEN NOW

THE DRUMS SOUND LIKE SHIT THAT KICK DRUM

2 DISCS RUNNING AT MINUTES IN TOTAL WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST CHUCK IT ON THE ONE DISC
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE OUT THERE OF ACTUAL QUALITY CAN'T IMAGINE I'D BOTHER WASTING TIME WITH THIS

DELETED
SWEET I CAN NOT EVER LISTEN TO IT EVEN SOONER
METALLICA DIED AFTER AFA

IS THIS ONE ENCODED AS WELL
REMOVED
REMOVED
LINK ANYONE
CAN SOMEONE PM ME A LINK OF SPIT OUT THE BONE

TOO MANY PEOPLE RAVING ABOUT THE SONG FOR ME NOT TO GET A BIT OF A TASTE OF IT BEFORE RELEASE
SADLY ENOUGH I DON'T CARE ABOUT METALLICA ENOUGH ANYMORE TO EVEN BOTHER PIRATING IT I'LL HOLD ON TO MY OLDMAN MEMORIES OF THE PAST
NAPSTER BAD
IT SOUNDS GENERIC WITH EXCEPTIONS THERE ISN'T ANYTHING SETTING THESE SONGS APART FROM A RANDOM GENERIC METALLICA OLD SONG

IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY GAVE UP ON CREATING ANYTHING NEW OR DIFFERENT SOUNDING I WOULDN'T BLAME THEM THOUGH THEY GET A LOT OF NEGATIVE REVIEW WHENEVER THEY DO ANYTHING THAT ISN'T PURE OLD-SCHOOL TRASH METAL IT'S EITHER GET FLAMED OR GET STUCK ON TIME FOR METALLICA AND THIS TIME THEY CHOSE TO PLEASE THE FANS AND GO BACK TO THE SOUTH
WTF QUIT IT AND ACT LIKE A REAL FAN
IT'S ALREADY ON THE RADIO AND IT'S CRAP
TAKES ME BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN I WAS DEATH MAGNETIC LEAKED EARLY TOO AND I WAS LIKE YEAH TAKE THAT LARS
SO WHO ARE THEY GONNA SUE NOW THAT NAPSTER IS GONE
METALLICA IS DEAD
REMOVED
REMOVED
