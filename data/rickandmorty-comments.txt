We need Unity! 
I'm sure people are going to go crazy, and start squanching everywhere!

Staying civil really isn't part of the whole Rick and Morty experience though, you know?  
total upvote, as someone who is not from Us, and don't care much about politics it is really hard today on reddit with all political posts
Coming as a long time R&M fan who just ran into this sub, good job on following the sticky.

Literally every thread is a political, extremely partisan, R&M meme. They aren't even good memes.
the political posts on this sub are great though
I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT
IM MR MEESEEKS LOOK AT ME

i would realy love an episode  about summer and satan. where they go on mystical adventures while rick and morty go on sci-fi ones 
and we have a competition science vs magic 
I hate glip glops
please ban all political posts already, this sub is turning to shit 
I just hope they put bits of anti fascism on SE03 as they did in the past. Maybe some cool analogy or something for an episode.
Could someone suggest a good quality picture that I could use for a personalised advent calendar for my SO for Christmas, I quite like all the parasites from Total Rickall and all the shots I can find with Santa in, to be festive, are pants from Anatomy Park. Any suggestions? (The advent calendar I'm using is better suited to a landscape image)
Imagine a Big Lez crossover
Can people tell me what they like so much about this show? I tried to get into it about a year ago after hearing friends and reviewers on the Internet rave about it, but I just couldn't for some reason. I think I got like 6 episodes in and I just didn't find it to be as monumental as people were claiming it to be. I'm planning to give it another shot, but I want to know what it is about this show that appeals to so many people.
Surprised 'rixty minutes' & 'interdiensional cable box' didn't advance/place. 
oh jeez, Lawnmower Dog and Rick Potion #9 are gone? this sucks
Shit, what the fuck, how did that weak-ass Pilot beat the best episode of the whole damn show?!
Is there going to be a season 2 bracket, and then a championship?
M. Night Shaym Aliens is amazing, I'm glad it's up there. 
Man, "Pilot" beat out "Rixty Minutes?" I feel like I don't even know this sub anymore.
Rick Potion #9 lost to Anatomy Park? Seriously? I mustn't have been watching the same show as everyone else.
Deff Close Rick Counters and M. Night ShaymAliens


Surprised that MeeSeeks and Rick Potion weren't in this round....
That last round was stupid close.
Genuinely shocked at all of the results last round except for the Close Rick-Counters victory.
Wait, this is only season 1?
Man, who is tipping the scales in the Pilot's favor?
OP why did you wait so long...
wow, this round is so easy to answer compared to the last.
how did love potion and neither cable episode not win??

Close Rick-counters should win this easily now.
Both M. night shaym aliens and close rick counters of the rick kind offer a lot of depth to the show. I would say in terms of adding depth to the show 10 is what makes you think about how Morty became that way. 4 has rewatch value as you can look for clues as to whether they're in the simulation still. Both great episodes
Only one of my big three favorite S1 episodes remain. Hoping Close Rick-counters takes this. Since Meeseeks and Rixty are out.
Anatomy Park in final 4?? God damn, that episode was horrible...
Four brothers, who aren't actually brothers, banded together by a strong bond, taking on Detroit. 
Running...in a van
They're, they're in a hallway, there is a light behind them, but can they handle it? Yes they can, it's 4 Brothers in a Hallway With a Light On Behind Them. 
Who are just regular brothers
It's actually a pretty decent film. 

Edit: How is this my second highest comment...?  I literally just said I liked a movie. Not that I'm complaining, just confused. 
Two Brothers... AND THEN...TWO MORE BROTHERS
Most of the comments here can be read as if it is all part of a single trailer for 4 Brothers. 
It's actually the fourth in the series.  

One Brothers was pretty weird.
It's just called Four Brothers
I actually really enjoyed that movie
BOBBBBBYYY!!!

JAAAAAACCCK!!!

BOOBBBBBBBYYY!!!

I actually love this movie. 
In the giant telepathic spiders universe there is is a three brothers movie. http://i.imgur.com/7J1Vmns.png
Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers who are just Regular Brothers running in a Van from an Asteroid and all sorts of THINGS... THE MOVIE
Mexican Armada
To be fair, Andre 3000 makes it more like *3.14 Brothers.* 
It's pretty tits if i remember right. solid revenge flick.
I'm gonna have to break character for a minute and talk about how amazing this is.
three brothers and a disembodied shoulder.
I can't wait for the prequel: One Brother
How did you like Ip Man 3 OP? I thought it was so much slower than the first two I had trouble getting through it.
Starring Jan Michael Vincent.
One of y favorite movies all time. I've got 3 bros and we watch it together all the time. 
It's got two Mexican armadas. 
They're just three brothers on the poster, you say. Were is the fourth brother, you don't wanna know about it but it's eeeeh aah, it's just called "Four Brothers".
How many...Jan Michael...Vincents...
Roiland & Harmon, do you see this!

Do you see what we've become?

Do you see what is happening to us all?

It's gone on far too long!

End this!
It's th-the sequel to two brothers. It-it's two brothers plus two brothers for a gr-grand total of four brothers! And their bond is stronger than ever 
The visceral third installment of the brothers franchise.

Two brothers

Three brothers (as seen in the microverse battery episode)

And now Four brothers 
It's honestly one of my favourite moments in Rick and Morty when Justin Roiland just loses it right at the end of the improvised Two Brothers trailer :")
Hamilton Ontario represent!
This movie is a reimagining of the classic  Western *[The Sons of Katie Elder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ou_x_rGgZY)* which starred John Wayne and Dean Martin. They're both really good movies imo.
IT'S TIME TO JAN MICHEAL DOWN YOUR VINCENTS!
i miss these blokes
Please watch it though. Actually pretty good.
Pretty good movie actually
I refuse to sign the legislation that allows more than two brothers.

I literally had this same thought the other night! 

IT'S JUST FOUR BROTHERS.
 
This is the first thing I thought when the episode aired
Theres also a movie on there that is just called 'Two Brothers' documentary about 2 tigers.
I say that every time I scroll past it on Netflix
^It's ^just ^called ^Four ^Brothers?
Damn that is such a good movie, I watch it every few months.
I think I'm gonna watch Band of Brothers now
I used to like this movie a lot when I was younger. Then I watched it again at 28 and I'm like, wtf... This is retarded.
Welp, I know what I'm watching tonight! xD
 
(waiting for season three is actually getting kinda fun, what with everyone jonzing and getting creative all over the place)

I honestly love this movie. 
It's a good movie... one of my favorites actually.
Real talk, there is a scene in this movie where Mark Wahlberg storms the court at at local basketball game, fires a gun in the air and tries to question the entire crowd as they understandably freak out and stampede to the exits.

Also, Andre 3000 stabs a dude.

In all honestly four brothers was a pretty good movie
Four Brothers: Jan Quadrant Vincent 20
Double. Down. Your. Brothers.
Isn't this actually the culmination of the trilogy that started with Brother? How is Band of Brothers related? Would that be the fourth?

Well twice the brothers of two brothers would be four brothers.
Everyone knows the sequel is '3 Brothers'. It first appeared in the universe with the psychic spiders
I may just be really stoned but I'm missing the reference. 
And you can bet your bottom dollar that they know how to take care of business
Not enough Jan Michael Vincent?
Ahh yes tis the season to gather with loved ones around the Yule Plumbus.
Then mark walberg appeared, and that's when things got knocked I to twelfth gear
I'm noticing an undesirable lack of Jan Michael Vincent.
In a hall...
[deleted]
That's the only Mark Wahlberg movie I like. Probably because Mark isn't the only lead.
The [prequal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338512/) when the two brothers were tigers. 
> "Two Brothers" - twice the brothers. Twice the action.

Could be directly from dimension C-1823, i don't like these lifeforms living there.
And then the Dutch windmills came!

There is actually a crappy movie called Two Brothers about two Tiger Cubs. It stars the Charlie from the Depp/Burton Wonka Movie.
Is this a reference to the universal cable episode(s)? 
This reminds me of that rick and morty episode where they had interdimensional cable TV.

eh, we don't need to worry about him. Just start with a Rick that didn't get sent to prison.
When is season 3 going to be out by the way? I can't wait for it.

If they did give us S3E1 this year, call it "I'll be home for Christmas."
Keep that murdering genocidal psychopath abomination locked up.

What did Rick do to get locked up?  "Everything"!

It's mentioned that the Council of Ricks only deals with Ricks on the Finite Curve. 
https://youtu.be/W1Kgl9aqOnI this video helped me out a lot with that
Nope - just the ones from the central finite curve.
These aren't problems, you just don't understand how infinity works. It gives infinite chances, it doesn't guarantee every single possible outcome. Giving an infinite amount of chimps an infinite amount of time to write on typewriters doesn't guarantee that they'll end up copying shakespeare's works. 

Rick is the chance that became the rickest.
At the end of the day it's still just a fictional story. So don't worry so much lol
Isn't it also mentioned that not every Rick is a member of the council?  C-137 didn't want anything to do w/ it, I can imagine there's other rogue Ricks that don't show up to the meetings.
Should've been Jerry and Sleepy Gary. 
But you know that guy eats poop, right?
Was this a good movie?
Why you gotta try and church it up? Who you tryin to impress? It's "Show me watchu got", or at the least, "Show me what you got." No contraction. 
yes 
I don't fucking know
You couldn't have an infinite universe within a universe surely? It could be finite within finite or finite within infinite but not infinite within anything. 
Are there? Possibly, hard to prove unless you can shrink/grow infinitely. *Can* there be infinite universes? Yes, you just need an arrogant asshole in each one to make the next.

Infinite dimensions, sure, that's the wild west of the show.
/r/solipsism is leaking again. Stay in your cave Jimmy!

I admire their attention to detail.
Which scene is this from?
Dan Harmon is a Zygerion scammer, confirmed?
Wait, is Rick and Morty on Youtube?
There is this whole theory that good Morty is not Rick's true Morty. Rick's true Morty is in fact Evil Morty.

The theory goes that Rick C-137 destroyed the entire universe and swapped to an alternate reality with Morty C-137. But Morty realized that Rick had to be stopped at all costs, turning into Evil Morty.

Rick arrives on Earth in this other reality, where he moves in with Beth and Jerry after having been missing for 20 years, here he meets good Morty.

There's a lot of small subtle hints to it in the show. My favorite hint is that when Rick drops Jerry off at Jerry daycare, he doesn't know which dimension Jerry is from, he fills out the form with Rick from dimension C-137, but writes a "?" in the slot for Jerry's dimension.

And when Rick is captured by Evil Morty, a device that looks into Rick's memories shows us Rick holding Morty as a baby. Something that would not be possible since Rick had been gone for 20 years. - Unless of course that Morty he is holding in the memory is Evil Morty C-137, and not our good Morty from dimension "?". 
Some believe that he's Rick's real Morty.

You can see in Rick's memories that he helped raise his Morty, but he never took part in the life of the Morty he has now.

It could be that a Morty actively raised by a Rick has the potential to be an evil genius.

Alternatively, he's from a dimension where the Rick and Morty roles were reversed.  I'd suspect that he was doofus Rick's Morty but as far as we know doofus Rick didn't have a Beth and so never had a Morty.
BURGERTIME!

^(**|** *`Don't be Rickdiculous. I do more than pass butter`*)

Evil Morty..is..your average Morty...but Evil.

Evil Morty is an evil Morty because he's evil
He is Morty but Evil.

Not crazy. Evil.
His Morty waves are so powerful that they mask the genius waves emanating from his own mind.

He's both Rick and Morty all in one, and we all know that genius and evil are the same just from different reference point.
Very cool!
I know what I'm being for Halloween next year. Thank you.

Justin Roiland confirmed that the stuff that Rick drank was supposed to align all versions of Rick. 

He wasn't just trying to kill himself, he was trying to kill all Ricks.
well it definitely would have erased his memory of her, thats for sure
So many opinions with so little premises...

So why does the weird Rick belong to the same dimension as Evil Morty? Cause Evil Morty (through Evil Rick) pointed to him and called him weird? Kinda sounds weak, care to elaborate?

Ash's relationship to Oak isn't *that* different from Morty's with Rick.

I was expecting a tightly clenched fist but the lack thereof is a perfect representation of the timid genes Morty has inherited from Jerry.

Girlfriend's parents hate all cartoons. Meanwhile they'll watch TMZ or Once Upon a Time.
I can't explain the dread when I put on Ricky and Morty for new viewers and they tell me half way through an episode "you said this was supposed to be funny can we watch adventure time instead" SMH
No. 
I have yet to come across someone who legitimately dislikes the show, except this one nutty Christian dude who said it was satanic or some shit. Speaks volumes about how versatile and well written the show is I suppose.
Probably the same way I feel when someone shit posts on this sub again.  BOO. NOT COOL.

It's bad.
Rick and morty is bad 
I want to downvote this just at the thought that anyone would say that.
If someone really did say this I would say they have no soul.
WTF would say that?

I've never heard anyone call rick and morty bad
i don't give a FUCK!
You forgot to have him grasping a seed
Is this 'has 5 fingers'?
Yeah I just walk away. There obviously don't know good TV. 
Since when has anybody ever called RAM bad? This is the most circle jerked show of all time.
good meme, but i sincerely have never heard complaints about the show.
TBH the second season wasn't as good as the first. Liked the last episode, soo much feels.
I've really never heard someone calling it bad.  They either really like it (like I do), or just say "eh, just not my thing" - which is perfectly fine.
Seems like everyone likes rick and morty now. I miss when I could make little references and only 1 or 2 people would get it.  I'm glad the show is successful though.
I deleted this chick I've known for 5 years when she couldn't give me one good reason why she thought "rick and morty is fucking stupid"
I don't get it.
Man rick and morty is WHACK
Im gonna do what real Rick would do if he was here. I'm gonna kick your ass!
I only know one like one person who had a decent reason for not watching it that's because she couldn't stand how terrible Rick is. The one scene where morty flashes back to all the bad shit Rick does to him, some of those were grounds enough to cut them out of your life.

> We did it! It was totally worth it--we just totally pulled it off. haha.
People who don't enjoy this show aren't intelligent enough to embrace the absurd as they live within it.
It's a pretty hard to watch show, even if you are retarded most people will change the channel.
Tell em to fuck off and go watch Archer or Bojack horseman 

I watch those shows when I need to fall asleep because they are boring as squanch 
i've yet to meet someone who doesn't think rick and morty is brilliant.
[deleted]
It's ok. I probably wouldn't have watched all of it at once if it weren't so short. There were a couple episodes I could say I really enjoyed, everything else just seemed meh. I probably laughed no more than twice through the whole thing (it is supposed to be funny, right?).
When it happens i do bothing because thatvsame person in limitless alternate dimensions has otger opinions better or worse than in this reality.
My girlfriend doesn't like this show.  I don't know what to do about it.  I've made her watch the first 3 episodes of season one and Total Rickall.  I get nothing from her.  It's so sad.
Triggered!!!
I think that it takes a few episodes in order to understand how good the show is. 
After the first 2-3 I was like WTF did I just watched but then you get used to it and you start to like it
I don't think anyone from any dimension has called 'Rick and Morty' bad.
My girlfriend claims that she hates it but she hasn't seen it and refuses to watch it. 

I showed her Futurama to ease her into the idea and she has watched the entire series front to back I think 5? times now... In about 4 months...

How do I convince her to see the light???
I like the show, but season 2 had really weak jokes/comedic writing, compared to season 1.
Dick and Warty
Okay, I'm out.

I might resub at season 3. Fuck this.
Me too, thanks
I hate this show.
I've actually never met anyone who said they didn't like it.

Also what the fuck is this garbage OP? Get your shit together. 
It's not bad, it's abysmal 
This doesn't happen. 
What? That's literally never happened.

Has anyone ever said the show was bad? I refuse to believe that, I won't be apart of any world that includes that, god dammit!
My gf said she was scared of the animation style for the longest time. Sat her down and dam nnear binge watched the damn show for like the 5th time xD Now I get to relive it with another gf.
I WANT TO SQUANCH
This is the best thing I have seen all week. X-files R&M mashup.
Sex sells.
Wait, is this a movie or a commercial, or what?
I don't recognise this frame, brb I'm going to watch the entire show again.
You might wanna get that checked out.
Just straight up blue balls down there.

@ornsmoughstein (OP)

There have been several theories, but that is certainly a possibility. 

* It is possible Rick escapes by escaping the simulation he's been in since S1E4. This 'out' can be used at any time to reset events when things get too crazy & convoluted.

* Our favorite Assassin Mr. Michael may make an appearance. Why would he do it? He just likes killing, and his best weapon clerk is locked up. The reasons are always simple.

* I remember reading some theory Jerry will have a main role in his escape, but I cannot recall the details.

Let's look at how they (Roiland) transitioned from season 1 to season 2. In the last episode of season one, Shit hit the fan on a large scale, the problem is solved at a cost, the drama is paused, drama is unpaused come the new season, a solution arises to outweigh the cost, yet a new problem faces Rick, and that problem is solved within the 1st episode of the new season. From that flow & assuming transition structure will remain the same, whatever happens to save Rick will work itself out within a short time (one episode.)

For Season 2, 

* Shit hits the fan. (The wedding is crashed and there's no returning home)

* The Problem is solved but at a cost. (Rick turns himself in to let the family return home)

* The Drama is Paused. (Rick takes a time out in Max Security Prison)

Season 3 will unpause the drama & save Rick, but a new conflict will come about.

_______________

**Here's a Theory** Squanchy either turns on Rick (may not be S3E1) or uses Tammy to help get him out. Why the betrayal? The same reason Clu turned on Kevin Flynn (Tron) & the knights betrayed James Franco (Your Highness); because they weren't BFF's. At the wedding Squanchy is grossly displeased when Rick announces Birdperson as his best friend. He shows this by taking off his Rick's BFF bracelet and tossing it on the table with a not so happy look on his face. Next, things go awry and Squanchy tells Rick to get out of here with his family. He then goes on a hulk rampage, shouting 'taste my squanch.' He stomps on Tammy's foot/leg, but does not kill her. The scene changes before that scenario can be played out. 

Depending on how Squanchy took in the events at the wedding, what happens with Tammy is anyone's guess. He could have killed her right out. He could have been beyond hurt Rick chose Birdperson as his BFF, spoke to Tammy and started collaborating with her as an inside man. He could have captured her (getting over Rick's BFF speech as Birdperson is dead) and intend on using her and/or her security clearance to break into prison and show Rick just how much of a BFF he really is. It just seemed toooo much of a cliffhanger to show Squanchy stomp on her foot, but not see the killing blow. 

I don't think he killed her. If she was to die (as much as she deserves to) they would have shown Squanchy tear her from limb to limb. Mostly every negative character that has made it clear they intend ill will to R&M (Frank the Frozen Bully, Mr. Jellybean, The Devil, Poncho, Alien Scammers, Fart, Alien Parasites, the Secretary of Defense, Purgers, and a ton of Bureaucrats) have been killed mercilessly. Some characters were left alive, Like Zeep or Evil Morty, to add possible plot twists later on. Even Gearhead stands as a potential Dr. Evilgear; craving vengeance for having his Bevel Gears ripped off and put where his Spurs belong. Same can be said of  Abradolf Lincler, but I don't think anyone would want to see him free from ceaselessly being shoved in & out of testicle monsters' anuses. Tammy falls into the latter category of those left alive. With that said, I strongly believe we have not seen the last of Tammy Gueterman. Whether she will return on S3E1 or later is up for question. It is possible she somehow miraculously captured Squanchy, but that squanch he's packing seems pretty unstoppable.
______________

As for Jerry's involvement with the escape, here's what we know:
 
* [Jerry](https://36.media.tumblr.com/ceb5f657ffa04faa0ce22fa06e9baad6/tumblr_nvqi0g8Epg1ub5fbwo1_1280.jpg) was wearing a tux with his bow tie undone at the end of S2E10. 

* Jerry has his own daycare. Per Rick, this daycare is on a [Cross Temporal](http://mimesisinternational.com/time-and-cross-temporal-relations/) asteroid (that's important.)

* Due to the ticket Theory being proven, the Jerry we follow in S2E2 is not the prime Jerry we know and love/hate. That Jerry is in awe upon entering the daycare, followed by a [Jerry](https://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/qcdjb5hwfotawq8x4xmdoxojbro-i4w810.jpg) with an undone bow tie having the same reaction. (the prime Jerry, whose never been to Jerryboree)

What we do know is in S3E1 Jerry is going back to daycare. The only thing that impedes this theory is Time. The Jerry in the tux arrives just after the S2E2 Jerry, yet a good deal of time separates them. That is where the asteroid being cross temporal comes into play & makes it fit. Now you could go on a limb and say Morty finds Rick's portal gun (are we sure it exploded & was destroyed?) or finds the means to transport himself & others to the daycare asteroid. Once there, it is possible Morty checks in his dad & calls upon other Ricks & Mortys to aid him in saving Rick C-137. It's possible, but beyond Jerry going back to Daycare (that's a fact) it's another weak theory. 
_________________
It is also very entirely possible the creators devised a different start to S3 to fuck with the fans who've waited a **long** time for S3. How would you feel if S3 starts normally with Earth not in the Federation, Rick is not in prison and life as we know it is in a sense normal. Morty turns to Rick (eating breakfast) and has a conversation  along the lines of:

M- "Geez Rick, I wish we coulda have gone to the wedding."

R- "Don't be an idiot Morty. Beyond being completely meaningless, you know that was a trap right? All those assholes who showed up are in a federation pound-me-in-the-ass prison now. I even saw on Rick-it [rick reddit] one of my dumbass versions of me got swooped up as well." /end of transition
After a season is released, this sub and many other media subs become a repetitive cycle of merely quoting the show over and over and over again.  Eventually this becomes unfunny, and the quotes dry up.  We're currently waiting for a fresh batch of quotes so the cycle can begin anew.

I think the target ceasing to exist counts. If you stab someone or they get crushed by a boulder they're equally dead.
If Meeseeks can't be killed, how could another Meeseeks command one to murder another in the first place?
neat, dude. thanks for the vid :)
My favorite is the one from "Total Rickall" where they're going through all of his catch phrases. While most of them are nonsense, the last one - "Li-li-lick my balls" is something Doc says in Doc and Mharti, the prototype for this show (it was changed for copyright concerns).
The first sweater you'll willingly wear is a sweatshirt?
Where did you get it?
Well no, 1 smug douche on 4chan doesn't.

Anyway who gives a fuck? 

People who don't like it are missing out.
I watch the show.  I laugh.  Sometimes I feel.

I don't need to justify that to this loser.
Everything that he complained about is part of what makes R&M great
Jesus Christ what a boring morbid cunt 
DISQUALIFIED
The need to constantly feel smarter and more important then others by shitting on something they love that has no negative affects to him, is he happy? Does it make him feel big and powerful? 

I'd love to just observe this person for a day. See how someone so much smarter and more important then me lives.
but like...what makes a good show is that it DOES appeal to it's audience. That the people who watch it are all able to *get it* together. Why validate random by even discussing it?

Please note how hate stemming from political ideologies is now spilling into discourse about anything and everything.

To paraphrase Rick - people are idiots, fuck em
Careful people, this guy is smart and way above all of us
Or sometimes, people find something funny, and that's the end of the discussion. It's not the result of lofty, complex marketing geared toward blah blah groups who like blergh blergh blergh because they're inferior. It makes people laugh, contemplate, whatever. The point is, it moves them in some way. In a society reduced to an almost clinical indifference to anything that isn't an opportunity to be offended, this tragically hip killjoy must be especially aggrieved that a simple animated series could be capable of providing what he never could: substance.

And this is the show that had a teenager shove illegal seeds up his arse, how the fuck is that pseudo-intellectual
lol this dude puts so much effort into doing mental gymnastics to justify hating us.

And the irony of him using "pseudo intellectual" is palpable.

This is fucking hilarious!
I couldn't care less what some basement-dweller thinks...
Can't believe I watched this show without picking a book about physics first

Please forgive me 4chan 
I love how he throws an insult to redditors, yet this guy is posting on 4chan.
Sounds like Skankhunt42
Hey 4chan, your website still looks like it was designed in 1998 and your average user ends up calling himself a faggot every other day or so because no one actually knows how to use your  shitty forum. Get fucked with a microplane.
Well there is a story it's just that the writers wanted to not extend over episodes too much so they don't scare away newcomers. There is also substance to the characters a lot of it is hidden to get people thinking more about them. For example with Rick you do find out more about him as the series progresses such as his relationships. 
The opinion of one jaded cynic ≠ all of 4chan.

Most of his points are exaggerated to fit his argument.
All I have to say if R&M is new family guy runs jokes that are from years past. At least South Park is running shit on the fly for the election season.
Lol he's just an elitist. 
Although I disagree with him, you must admit that he has some valid points.
4chan has been normalfag central for years. Also, only normalfags use normie.

^(**|** *`Don't be Rickdiculous. I do more than pass butter`*)

Never read the comics. 
They are actually really interesting. Perfect to tide you over till season 3
You went in with spoilers, expecting something amazing.

Something amazing happened, but you were too wrapped up in your own expectations to see it.


You're like "It's just a baby. Anyone can do that." while the miracle of life slipped past your small, jaded little worldview.
It was the biggest head fuck in the show at the time, at least for me. 6 episodes into the first season of a cartoon show and you have a 14 year old burying his own corpse and dealing with living a life he has no business living, all while a Mazzy Star song played.

It's kind of like when a kid who grew up with a 360 tries an SNES, sure they might enjoy it but they'll never *appreciate* it the same way a 35 year old does. I'm really happy I got to consume the first season without really knowing what the show was.
It's because you assume that Rick's cooking up some fantastic scientific answer - then you see a newspaper drop saying the plague was cured, so you think it worked. You get a little pissed that such a fantastic storyteller like Dan Harmon would just wave his hands and "solve" the plot without showing the answer. You see Rick and Morty working in the garage and BOOM THEY FUCKING DIE. HORRIBLY. Our Rick and Morty pop out of a wormhole and THAT'S the solution. That's why it's fucking brilliant. Both because the death is both shocking and completely logical and from a storytelling standpoint you get pissed that the story's been tossed in the trash like an old Star Trek episode (just run them through the transporter with the old pattern image and presto chango good as new) and then you get a shocking, clever and completely logical answer to the story.

If you're watching this 2 years later after you now about all the infinite universes etc. then it's not the same. Sorry, you had to be there.

yeah hahah initially assumed it was because he was so much older 
There were two more elements of foreshadowing well before this.

Rick : "weddings are just funerals with cake"

Morty at the bar: "it's not like he's dying"


This was in the season finale no?
The ceremony was beautiful. The reception, not so much.

Probably a relative height thing. Since they're in a giant-populated world, the difference between 4.5 giant inches and 5 giant inches probably scales up when configured with our normal measuring system
The real answer to this is likely that scene setup wasn't paying attention and neither was the animator. 
Uh ohhhh! Somersoult jump!

---

^(**|** *`Don't be Rickdiculous. I do more than pass butter`*)

The animators didn't took care of this detail and just used the same background for both
Rick is getting scwifty on the floor.
I kind of assumed Morty is a full foot shorter, you don't see the feet marking just inches. I'd believe Rick is 6'4" and Morty is 5'4", he is quite short and Rick is pretty tall. 
Morty is standing a little bit closer to the camera.
Probably isn't the case but it seems as people get older especially with back problems they will get shorter
You can see their proper relative heights on the animator guides: e.g. here: http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cronen1.jpg
I thought Morty was 15 or 16, summer 16 or 17, Rick 70 ish, Beth and jerry 39 ish
You use it to squanch.
Dicks
Just wait for the plumbus spin-off series in 2017 and you'll have it all explained 
You're not fooling anyone OP. Everyone has a plumbus in their homes.
It's used as a cleaning tool, I remember I saw an image somewhere which indicated how does a plunbus work and how to maintain it
Hurt is not by Johnny Cash.

But that is a good touch.
oh god everyone here thinking Hurt was by Cash originally makes me feel ooooollllldddddd
Who covered "Hurt" in the episode? I am pretty sure it was not Cash, was it NIN?
It was the [NIN's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCAK6MZ4FEs). 
Ohhhh that's beautiful 
I like the way you squanch
You bored dude?
You got their eyes wrong... 

But other than that they are great!
Love how everyone's bodies are over exaggerated and then there's Jerry, the same pathetic P.o.S.
Make Idgaf great again.
Yes, we've all seen that episode too.

I saw a  [shirt](http://hottopic.scene7.com/is/image/HotTopic/10735100_hi?$pdp_hero_standard$)  similar to that yesterday 
I think there are not enough characters yet. if you'd take EVERY character shown in R&M it would be too much.
I was about to ask the same thing. I heard rumors of Early December 
nah nada 
If there were anything real it would be the top post on this subreddit
boy, fuck you, Jon! 
"Goodbye Moonmen" and "Shiny" as sung by Jermaine Clement
Having all your own memories would be the best way to play...
I'm pretty sure nobody here has actually played R2:D, and are just trolling you. As you must know, in this universe, the Roy series games are a fictional arcade video game that exists inside a wildly popular animated TV show on a planet who's technology is no where close to actually being able to make a game similar enough to the Roy series of games that you're familiar with. Since each game is single-player, everything around you is simulated, and there is exactly zero-chance of meeting another Roy player. You just gotta wait until World of Roycraft before there'd be GMs to call. Until then, having your memories gives you the rare opportunity to minmax the shit out of your character. If you want a more genuine experience, just hope the glitch was completely random and try again when you get out. If it's still glitching, just kill yourself. Don't worry, I won't mind not existing. Can't care if I don't exist, am I right? lol.
I would pay many shmekles for this. 
You went back to the fucking carpet store... 
Shout out to u/joshmanzors I hope you aren't foolin yo
that'd be so interesting to see 
Now... go now.. and *burp* fucking watch flight of the... concords 
I noticed it the second the crab started talking. It was distracting hahaha
Judging by only those two songs (Goodbye Moonmen and Shiny), I don't think Jermaine Clement is capable of not sounding like David Bowie.
It exits the scene very clearly
This is clearly a poke at Richard Gere, no? For the gerbil-in-the-ass rumors.
Hahaha he is reading Buttholes the best way to sell your ass to other hamsters.
That's Rickdiculous

That's really good!! 
Shroomed out of his mind

> There are speculations that the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; Season 3 air date could be coming by December 2016.

> In a previous GamenGuide article, it was reported that the animated series&#039; third season release could be happening by December and seemed to be based on the announcement made by writers Erica Rosbe and Sarah Carbiener that they are done writing last September 2016.

> Aside from the color changes, an episode in the upcoming season that deals with a sex robot could set roadblocks to the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; Season 3 release.

There's already a VR game called Accounting out on steam created by Justin Roiland.  Its fantastic.

I bet you 10 schmeckles there'll be a PC port announced a few months after release.
HE'S GOING OFF THE GRID
Stupid ass Fart saving carpet store motherfucker!
That's the difference... I don't go back to the carpet store...
I'm already playing Roy 2: Dave
Schmeckelbot, how many dollars is 666 schmeckles?
The older I get (I'm pushing 50), the more credence I lend to the theory that life actually *is* a game of Roy. It would make a lot more sense than any religious dogma I've heard. 
What the hell?! Wh wh where am I? What in the hell?!
Pretty sure I'm playing this right now
Just wait till time distortion is invented, and this can be real. I tell you hwat, I would spent minutes playing a game like this. I might even put a whole half hour into multiple playthroughs. 
 

That 'RP' doesn't stand for 'Rating Pending', it stands for 'Role-Playing'.

666 Schmeckles?
What's exciting is they've announced they are making a Rick and Morty VR game. 
OFF THE GRID!!
I would buy this and a VR setup if it were real....
I think its dumb they have to tell people with pictures you need vr shit to play a vr game.
9.03847 schmeckles?
20 schmeckles?
Anybody else been able to get off the grid? I keep getting locked into my SIN and can never get enough funds to move out of the city. 
200 schmeckles?
I can't wait for PS9 to come out, but I really hope there's a PC version cause we all know the graphics will be better on that.
that is the one game that could get me to buy the PS VR
I'm taking my Roy off the grid. He won't even have a social security number. 
Dat kerning tho
I would buy a PSVR if that was a thing
It's just a fever
I always get stuck on the Puberty levels...
I would watch an entire episode of them playing Roy. 
Pfft...  That game is too good for consol/pointy nipple race. PCircle nipple race is the master race! 
Well I'm Roy, here I go killin' again!
.078 schmeckles
Roy's our boy 
Should be released on vive first
Is this real life?
I'd drop $1000 for the ps4 and vr just to get this

Wait, INVADER ZIM IS BACK?
Bojack Horseman has a extremely different setting but it has alot of elements of Rick and Morty
Idk maybe Futurama for the general style of humor. Other than that, RnM is pretty unique
Futurama and Doctor Who
Space Dandy
Dr who.

Originally, this is what made me like RnM so much. It's very similar to Dr. Who's randomness.

If you're looking for randomness Chowder is another show that comes to mind.

Gravity Falls. More kid friendly but it's a great show and does have a few tie-ins to rick and Morty. You'll also hear R & M's familiar voices from time to time on different characters in the show. 
Over the garden wall
Venture Bros is similar in that there is super science, and it's hilarious. Extremely dark though.
Futurama or BJH are you best bets here.

"Aids!"
* Man vs. Car
* Jan Quadrant Vincent 16
* The Adventures of Stealy
* Lil' Bits
* The Personal Space Show

All the above hold a candle to the skits from the original episode, if not surpass them. I agree that the premise is kind of thrown together, but they address that with Rick saying, "A sequel . . . we pretty much nailed it the first time." Everyone is aware that they're just using the premise again because they want to. Jerry's plot is kind of secondary to the shows themselves, but it's still funny to see his pitiful character is such a desperate situation.
It is also my least favorite episode. And I have watched them all several times. It's definitely the one I find myself skipping. 
I love both. So much in fact that my iPhone lock screen is a box of Eyeholes.
Better than the first one, but they are terrible at improv. I reaaally hate both episodes.
Daaamn this is sick man, nice work.

Could be this time next year. The writing is done (which is the only thing the community knows for certain) but the animation, and the best time to release it, could take awhile.

If you need something to tide you over, you could always start The Venture Brothers.

That is a really great example... of a horrible idea, I feel bad for both of us :|
In the episode one episode at the table Rick mentions to Summer that  god doesn't exist i'll just rip that band aid off right now. 
Uh...OP maybe you need to lay off the Kalaxian crystals for a while.
Except that Rick is doc and morty is mcfly from Back to the Future
I like your thinking :) Rick being 'a' god is definitely canon - whether it's because he has the power to create universes (like the mini-verse) or destroy them (oppenheimer 'I am become god', the cuthulu call out in the opening sequence etc) and I really like reading theories around those themes.
But you lost me with the Morty being his father part - It's just not...*needed* is the only way I can explain my aversion to this theory.
But well thought out theories all the same!
Also Rick says a cocky Morty is trouble for everyone. I don't think everyone is an exaggeration
Well, would you look at [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Show_with_Bob_and_David), and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_F._Tompkins#Early_work) thing too
That's legitimately horrifying.

Everyone i know, goes away, in de end 🎶
The wait....it actually hurts...
I very commonly only get into shows when they're 6+ seasons in or they're already finished. 

This is a new type of pain for me. 

It's gotten the point where I play episodes in the background while I play videogames since I don't need to see the screen anymore
lemme tell you bout the gear wars
The thing that people don't realize about Rick and Morty, is that it was never really about Rick and Morty to begin with...
i didn't even know it was possible not to watch the entire 2 seasons in a 2 day span 
If he's not even caught up then why does he want season 3? Is it just like a "I don't want to have to wait when I catch up" kind of thing?
My man! 
I wish I could wipe my memory so that I can enjoy it all over again. :(
I have never seen an episode. Maybe it will be my weekend binge.
Clearly no Venture Bros fans in here...you don't know the pain of waiting!
I just saw this post minutes after rewatching the scene 
I feel like I joined the R&M hype train too early. I'm also drunk af so I cant focus.....
I remember seeing a lot of the original "Where's season 3?!?" Hype and thinking "These guys need to relax."

I finally got around to watching an episode and was immediately hooked. I binged watched both seasons within a week and am now, too, desperate for season 3. 
This is how I feel about Young Justice. I took a break in the middle of season 2 because I don't want to have the pain of being stuck on some cliffhanger.

Now that season 3 has been confirmed, I don't know if I should finish season 2 or wait until season 3 has a release date!
If the wait is insane, and you like sci-fi, the redone WESTWORLD is actually reminding me of BSG - everyone expected a retread of an old 70s property, beat for beat, but **damn** is it well done and fun!


(Channel 4 from the UK - available via AMC - also has HUMANS, a take on androids being part of daily lives, along with a small group of conscious androids on the run, and a typical family who unknowingly play a part. Damn good show based on a Swedish show, REAL HUMANS.)
I've never seen this show. Is it any good?
How much does your friend know about the gear wars
My sister doesn't like the show. I don't know what to do
I just pass butter so it's really fine by me
He doesn't even know Gearheads real name.
I couldn't even tell you how many times I've watched both seasons in anticipation for season three haha 
pff i finished the whole two seasons in 2 days
would you go to a party hosted by someone who calls you Chinese face?
This is just like when I tell people I never seen breaking bad
I was sick and watched both seasons in a day. Boy, do I regret that. It was an emotional roller coaster of laughing and crying but at the end I was left in eternal disarray at the constant words playing on a loop in my mind. Where's season 3?
It was never really about the gears at all. 
My mom just started and she keeps asking me when the new season starts!
As someone who usually likes this kind of show...why can't I get into it? I watched the first one and it was just a panicked kid and his drunk gramps. Should I watch more? What draws you in? Serious question...I want to know what the special sauce is.
I watched two episodes a few months back. Maybe I should keep watching huh 
The gear wars.
I can spend my time waiting for season 3, by waiting for season 2 of Harmonquest.
Netflix is just rubbing it in by telling me there's 'new' episodes out. I hate them.
Same with my girlfriend, she still hasn't seen all of season 2 yet. Once Season 3 comes out, she has allot of Rick and morty to watch compared to me.
Didn't they say 2016?

Didn't they promise?
Do you even know my name? Its revolio clockwork jr.

you are not necessarily wrong i think, this is just extremely far-fetched. Even for Rick and Morty theories.

"It's in theaters now! Coming this summer...

The Moon. It comes crashing into Earth! And whaddya do then? It's two burgers and I- and...and they're gonna...it's called 'Two Burgers' ...'Two Burgers'...it's just called 'Two Burgerss'! [breaks off laughing]"

No, because it's all -possible- universes. Either God is a possible entity and exists in all entities because it is impossible to have a universe without God, or God is not possible and therefore cannot possibly exist in any universe. 

You also wouldn't be able to have any universes where 2 + 2 = 5 or any gross paradoxes. 

But, I mean, I also didn't think teenyverses were possible. 
Why must you fuck my mind this close to nighty night time
The ontological argument.

I like it.

Plantinga formulates it like this:

1. There is a possible world (you can read this as "alternate dimension") in which greatness is instantiated.

2. Necessarily, a being is maximally great only if it has maximal excellence in every world (dimension).

3. Necessarily, a being has maximal excellence in every world if it has omniscience, omnipotence, and moral perfection in every world.

If there is a possible world in which maximal greatness is instantiated, then necessarily there is a being which has maximal excellence in actuality (or if God is possible, then God exists).

Anselm's version goes like this:

>Even a fool, when he hears of a being than which nothing greater can be conceived understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his understanding. And assuredly that, than which nothing greater can be conceived, cannot exist in the understanding alone. For suppose it exists in the understanding alone: then it can be conceived to exist in reality; which is greater. Therefore, if that, than which nothing greater can be conceived, exists in the understanding alone, the very being, than which nothing greater can be conceived, is one, than which a greater can be conceived. But obviously this is impossible. Hence, there is no doubt that there exists a being, than which nothing greater can be conceived, and it exists both in the understanding and in reality.

It's a real mind blower.

I would love if they just don't even address it, or maybe just a brief newscast in the background talking about an alternate Rick being arrested. 
Can you catch me up to speed? What is this "Rick dies in prison" talk?
The answer is don't think about it.

^(I am a bot | )[^(`what is my purpose`)](https://github.com/Elucidation/existential_rick_bot 'don't think about it')
Of all the different universes, there has to be at least one where religious fiction is real.
I really recommend "Needful Things", that's the Stephen King book the ep was based on.  Good read, ending is kind of flat though.
Why not? Rick and Morty takes inspiration from sci fi and horror story tropes. 
Why not?
There's a Wisecrack video discussing that the episode you're referring to was a metaphor for how science could be used to dispel/bypass what once could only be explained by the supernatural. Hence, the Devil was included. There's more to it than that, like little shoutouts to pop culture and stuff, but that's a good place to start.

You can always play those shitty Rick and Morty flash games on Adult Swim lol. But aside from mobile games and the one VR game we have, I definitely think we need a real game. Maybe a game that would take place in the secret lair in "Close Rick counters of the Rick Kind" where you're a Morty and you have various crap to do. Or maybe a rick and morty saw game?

Nah, she's clearly a Cylon!
I dont think shes an android. I think she just had support and said they were her parents.
Uhm, its way more likely she lied about those androids being her parents, dont you think?
To be fair, that doesn't necessarily mean she's an android. She could be a human from another planet (if that's a thing, though that's unlikely) or a shapeshifting alien that works for the Galactic Federation. No proof for either of these, mind you. I'm just saying we don't know for sure whether Tammy's Robo-parents are her parents or just there for cover (keeps people from asking questions about why a teenage girl is living by herself with not even a mention of parents). She *could* be an android but she could also be something else.
I've been waiting for Persona 5 since winter of 2014

I can handle this wait with no problem
/r/bravestwarriors would like a word.
I waited and still waiting for Half Life 3 since....so I can wait for season 3 easily...

both have 3 in it.. let's hope it's doesn't share the same fate.

*turns page* limbo
I have been watching The Venture Bros for a long time. R&M is freaking fast by comparison. I assume it's because the VB guys need to finish all their crack before they have the need to make more episodes. 
Just think of the quality that results from waiting! Sometimes all you need is time, having burnt out episodes wouldn't help at all...
For when is it planned?
Never heard the song go I rewatched the last part of the last episode then listened to it. 
I agree that would be bad ass
Season 3 can't start with Rick breaking out of prison.
The whole reason Rick turned himself in was to protect the family.
If he breaks out, the smith family would get interrogated. It doesn't make sense. 
No jumping in the sewer.

K. Michael is dead. I don't understand how people missed that part. Morty flattened him when he crashed through the wall. 
I never understood why the K. Michael theory gets so much attention. I really doubt that they're going to start making death meaningless by bringing back dead characters from other dimensions, at least not as a major plot point. I have a feeling that Justin Roiland is going to come up with something very few people will see coming, but with the amount of theorizing going on I bet the community has hit on *some* details. 

I like the Unity idea because she has expressed desire to take over the Galactic Federation so it's reasonable that she already has info on their infrastructure and might have puked in a few federation mouths already.

Aw man I'd love another Meeseeks episode. 
Doubt it as they could barely sort out morty's dads golf game
Yeah, I'm thinking either mr. Meeseeks or Unity is gonna end up busting Rick out because they got numbers. 
What if they run a few episodes along a story arc handcrafted behind fan theories and then stopped abruptly and Rick just tells us to think for ourselves and not be sheep.
The answer is don't think about it.

"What is this, a crossover episode?" - Mr. Peanutbutter
>I feel like Rick and Bojack would have an interesting friendship.

I think Rick would just call Bojack a whiny little pussy and get the hell out of dodge.

Great shows, I can't see any crossover potential though.
Drinking is what would happen.
I'm actually making a comic about that right now :3 I'm going to be posting it soon 
    hey look Rick, it's a world that has humans AND horse humans!  
    oh look, there's a talking penguin too!

    (burp) yeah, Morty, come on, we've got (burp) more  
    important things to (burp) do than play Where's Waldo with 
    (burp) a couple of discount mminotaurs.

    So, I don't get it, like, do the horses still only eat fruit and  
    vegetables? they still need a lot of protein for their human  
    half, right? and do they still think like horses, because I  
    don't see much in the way of horse-related entertainment...

    you know what, Summer? you're right. This is a weird place, we  
    should just get what we need and go.

    great, like I said in the first place.  

    llet's just find our guy and go home.

Great movie.  Just to add to OP's description, Ritter and his wife get zapped by the satellite dish and get sucked into the tv shows themselves.  The kids find out by watching tv.  
Madagascar wasn't even in Madagascar 3...
Also he loses a bet if he dies in a cage.
I just want this image to get more and more ridiculous as time goes on until Season 3. Today it's arrows, tomorrow it could be highlighting, the next day codes. Make it happen guys, I believe in you.
I mean, it's not like there's only one Rick in this show 
How many times are we going to post this?
They already showed a video where he was a bug killing rats escaping the prison. idfk. They showed it somewhere (the creators of the show) wtfever. End of story. Or beginning. idgaf. Rickety rickety rekt son!
They kill off the title character in The Walking Dead all the time...
In general, yes. Pretty entertaining, and sometimes a lot more complex than what the show can explore. Especially if you're fiending for more until next season.
They're not wrong. I like all those things.
I wish Rick and Morty was on Netflix in the US...

Believe it but I think evil Morty is our Ricks original Morty but turned evil because Rick raised him to be smart
I think Evil Morty is Doofus Rick's Morty.

If the Rickest Rick has the Mortyest Morty, then the least Rickest Rick should have the least Mortyest Morty.  Doofus Rick should have the smart Evil Morty. 

Doofus Rick said he never had kids but I believe he did and Evil Morty erased his memory and had him assigned to Eric Stoltz Mask Morty so he could continue on with his plans uninterrupted.

I'm hoping saving Rick involves time travel so they can also prevent the death of Bird Person. There's always that box in the garage that says time travel stuff, so it seems possible.

The entire show and concept is improv. At this point Dan Harmon is playing it by ear and Justin Roiland and everyone else are guest stars. That's why the episodes are so manufacturable.

I refuse to believe that the one on the right is real. It literally looks like it was edited in on a phone app. 
If I were the one on the right... Oh boy. There isn't a diplomatic way to put this...

Let's just say that the thing that rhymes with 'unified' wouldn't be out of the question. 
My understanding is that C-137 the dimension "our" R&M came from, and that after RP#9, they're living in an unspecified new dimension.  If I recall, "Mortynight Run" shows Rick filling out a form when he drops off his Jerry, and that form specifies Rick as being from C-137 and Jerry's home dimension as "N/A."
This is the first "[Rick](https://youtu.be/gMsEFWO_oi0)" I ever cared about as a kid.

r/fucktammy
I just thought that images that are, for lack of better words, two layers deep, don't need to be censored out right. The picture doesn't need to be censored because it isn't the show's interpretation of a naked person, it is the show's interpretation of a character's drawing/interpretation of a naked person. 

Either way, I love how the picture showing a depiction of her naked body is used to censor her naked body. A hilarious fuck you to censorship.
in his drawing even where the nipples are probably supposed to be, there are black bars that act as censors. 

And honestly, his drawing is barely even approaching suggestive anyway. 

Its a face two scribble circles and more scribbles

South Park gets away with penises and sometimes tits too. Maybe Rick and Morty just doesn't wanna walk that line and prefers the suggestive nature of their usual provocative jokes. 
You've never watched South park huh?
Still not that bad. In Poland child nudity in art (like drawing or sculpture) is a crime. And it's not a dead law - there are people who already got sentenced. I don't mean only pornographic art, but let's say if it would be little Jesus with a dick hanging out, then you'll get sued.
Censorship should not exist, it's against freedom of speech. Also, why the fuck are the episodes censored on Netflix ?!
Maybe he was just bored or liked to imitate big blockbuster films in a grotesque way. Not everything has to have a deeper meaning.
I remember him saying it was a response to the cease and desist for his Cosby animation, so he wanted to provoke a reaction from universal. 
If you mean from a brick and mortar store and you're close to a Hot Topic that's where I've gotten my stuff.

Depends *entirely* on the compression method and quality.

At "raw DVD rip" quality, you'd have four disks, so somewhere around 34GB (assuming dual-layer).  At raw Blu-ray, you have two discs at up to 50GB (probably *not* dual layer).

Realistically, you could beat that by a *wiiide* margin - Compressing DVD-quality to MP4 would drop that by *easily* a factor of 4, so potentially under 10GB.
My Season 1 uncensored 1080p and Season 2 1080p iTunes downloads come to just over 18gb in total. That's the highest that you should be at!

88.6 GB
Between 2 and 40 gigabytes. Depending on how much quality you want.

We're talking the difference between a 360p divx encoded .avi to a 1080p x264 encoded .mkv

Holy shit, this is so annoying when they get into politics and your family members' beliefs clashes with each other's. 

Fortunately, you had R&M to think about! :)
I feel your pain, brother. I'm just sitting here trying not to interrupt the conservative echo chamber. 
Why?
I'm sure there's an infinite amount of dimensions where it is and an infinite amount of dimensions where it isn't. 
I'd rather have "Total Eclipse of The Heart" by Bonnie Tyler. It could me a montage sequence of Rick in prison missing his family, but eventually he breaks out and when the actual happy part of the song starts playing, Rick reunites with the family. Idk though, thought that would be cool and touching (and could bring more humanity to Rick)  
I always assumed he used a ready-made computer and the fact that it could feel despair was a byproduct of having a talking thinking butter robot. Rick don't care.
I don't think it's that he's trying to spread his misery, but it does give us a fairly deep insight into Rick in about 30 seconds.


You mean a guess at why he built it.

If we go by dialogue, he outright says "You pass butter."

Not "You're my psychological punching bag."

As far as how I feel subjective about your guess/theory, I think Rick's character with dramatic qualities comes about in very exaggerated ways. This scene is way too simple and casual to have such a deep meaning as "oh look he's trying to make another life form as miserable as he is".

Look to Unity and 2nd Season Ep 1 to see just how Rick actually deals with despair / misery. 
My money's on this; the first episode starts with the smiling family returning home with Rick and someone saying "well, glad we got that out of the way!" And then just returning to normal R&M
The creators said they don't want him being stuck in a jail to span multiple episodes and that it will happen withing the first episode
Since someone mentioned it the other day I hope unity frees him

I'm worried they'll just start following another rick
I'm about 90% sure that they shouldn't be walking there. 
W-w-what's that rick?!?
Jokes on you! The gaseous beings can't travel through Rick's portals
Isn't c-137 cronenburged anyway?
I mean.. there's an infinite amount of them. Fuck it
Doesn't matter.  According to Rick, a completely gaseous being cannot pass through the portal.
Nah leave it to the other 5
Wow that's a good way of putting it.
*Mist* is a German term for crap. 

*"Drop your pants, take a shit on the floor..."*
Is the first word supposed to say "list" or "most"?
To name one (there are a whole bunch, and they can be so perfectly subtle at times): the part in 'A Rickle in Time' when Rick nearly sacrifices himself to save Morty (and seems totally at peace with doing so).
*spoils* The end of auto - erotic assimilation seems to be the obvious winner. Total despair, refusing to accept Summer's subtle "do you need help," killing the Croninberg creature, it was the high tech version of Russian roulette, seeing if whatever he drank would knock him out before the bulb blew and killed him. Haunting
I think the scene where morty kills fart in order to save the universe is pretty heavy. You have a kid who is forced to kill a friend or watch him and every carbon based life form die. 
Lick, lick, lick, my BALLS!

^(**|** *`Don't be Rickdiculous. I do more than pass butter`*)

Im not gonna go for the two touchiest parts but this is a no brainer.there are two parts that raise the most hell on this sub. The conclusion to auto erotic assimilation and the king jelly bean scene. Hands down these are the highest and lowest points for the show bc of how damaged our world and society is whether it be the touch on suicide/heartbreak/rape/self destruction. I bet money these are the most debated and discussed scenes on this whole sub.do not upvote me.

Add turkey bone ears?

This reminds me of a story.
There was a man (I think he immigrated from Vietnam) who came to live in my city years ago.  I came almost every day for lunch.  It was a short walk from my office.  I would always ask how he was doing and then I would wait to listen.  Eventually after a year or two he felt comfortable enough to ask me questions.  One thing he asked was for some advice on what he should do for holiday decorations since he overheard some diners talking that he didn't have any and asked him why and he didn't know what to say.  He was also a very frugal and pragmatic man which are great qualities for any restaurant owner/manager.  When I made him a list and explained to him what to do I could see from his demeanor and follow up questions that it kind of bothered him that he would need to find storage space for each giant box of decorations for each holiday that would only be used for a few weeks each year.  That began a sort of continuing joke between us on how the holidays really weren't so different.  I found a Halloween troll for him at Value Village that with a bit of repair looked pretty good inside his front entrance holding Halloween candies for the kiddies.  Then before he had a chance to take it down I came in and dressed it up as a Christmas elf and with a fake white beard it almost looked "Christmasy" enough, although maybe a bit spooky if you looked too closely at the eyes.  He had a really great sense of humor.  Until he retired and sold his restaurant we would make a game of repurposing holiday decorations.

Thanks for reminding me of this story!

The Blair Rick Project

Morty becomes fascinated with the paranormal after watching a series of ghost hunter shows. Oddly, Rick agrees that ghosts exist but is appalled by the shows lack of evidence and takes matters into his own hands.

He and Morty go to a haunted house with Ricks own "ghost hunting" equiptment but Ricks drunken asshattery opens a door to hell and unleashes Demons into the world.

Rick accidentally gets sucked into a portal to the past, so Rick decides to make sure Beth doesn't go to the prom with Jerry. Meanwhile, Summer and Morty harness the portal to cheat on their exams.

I amazed you were able to get a shot so lacking in people considering it's the day before the holiday. 
I didn't read the sub it was in and for some reason when I saw the picture i thought it was about The Langoliers.
Have you tried C-136 though ? I heard people are nice and the world is at peace.
it's funny because that's the same number as Rick's dimension
1 dimension short of the dimension where most of the population are Jewish. 

/Travels too much 
I'm like 55% sure you went to penn state 
You sad sack of shit people really need a new season if this is the "quality" of content you'll upvote.
Is this just a /r/shitpost, or am I missing something? Is this supposed to be funny? Can someone explain the reference cause I'm so lost!

EDIT: ohhhhhh C137, I get it, I will let this one slide! Although it's still a stupid shitpost
Good, get out of New Jersey as fast as you can. 
Make sure you watch out for that asshole who eats his own shit. 
Whew kansas city right?!
Wasn't C137 destroyed when Rick Croningberged everyone?
Delta in the Newark airport? 
C137 FOR THE WIN!
This post threw me into a rabbit hole that now makes me want to rewatch rick n morty. Community influence at it's finest. 
Is this Frankfurt airport?
Morty, no one cares.
Broh your glasses are lame
You Fucked up. You got some of your stupid face in the photo. 
Are you wearing makeup
If that was your home dimension, you would be a cartoon. 
Your home dimension is the one that got all Cronenberged up?
Justin Bieber?
The do the dialogue first, then animate. A lot of animation is done that way.

Fun fact: Many of Hank Scorpio's lines  improvised.
I would personally say M. Night Shaym-Aliens purely because of the line: "Too loud, Cynthia! Too loud and too specific!"
I have to go with The Ricks Must Be Crazy. The A and B plots are both so strong. "Keep Summer Safe" will always make me laugh. I'm a big fan of any episode that has a world within a world thing going on though. So M. Night Shaym-Aliens is definitely up there in my favorites as well. (I say "My Man!!" to people often but I'm pretty sure they have no idea I'm quoting R&M...)
/r/titlegore 
That's a well accessorized Morty.
"Show me the Morty!"
omg that's really good!!!
Lick my balls mharti.
If you don't get it, the drawing looks a lot like the art style of Rick in the original, "Doc and Mharti" shorts where the show originated from. I don't know if this has been posted before, but it's a funny detail nonetheless.
It's Rich from the popular show Rich and Morto
I'm Mister Bulldog
Chicago?
Yep 
I think that is Your wifi name and i think you think we will be all like "oh wow a rick and morty thing" - Upvote upvote upvote.

Maybe it isnt but i'll always be a cynic with things on the internet.

Nice, how long did it take. It's on my list of things to print
Maybe Birdperson was having a little drink.
Rick and Morty is on Netflix? 
Really cool! Keep up the good work
I think Rick is the only one who can break the fourth wall, you should look up the theory about Rick knowing he is in a show, it's pretty good 
I think they did at the end of season one.

It would make better sense than morty being able to rescue him
That or some new technology is available that is the solution to the problems. I wonder how often new devices are added on each episode basis

I like it!
Well the last episode of season 2 aired October 4, 2015. At the end of that episode, Mr. Poopy Butthole said "a year and a half... or longer!" So if we go by that being factual, it would be April of 2017... or later. 
They have yet to announce a return date.
In like a year and half
they expect it wil air on december 2

Try tracing a copy a few times, it helps with learning the geometric spacing of his features
His hair is like a black guys where the line in the back and above the ears is pretty high. Also there is no fear in this morty. 
I actually really like this. I would lose the lines under the eyes, yeah. I dig the style. Keep it up! Let's see a Rick next!
hahaha I remember this scene from the very first episode
"5 more minutes of this and I'm gonna get mad!!!!........" 
I've got respect fir your buddy. I've done some lettering with wood burning, I found it quite challenging. Impressive!
That's really cool 
Yum.
No relation...
I seriously rewatched that episode today! 
Rick and Morty is the official cartoon of the sandwich board artist union 
That sign clearly says "the*** meatball shop" op is both fake and gay 
It's "Lick, Lick, Lick My Balls!"
This is what happens when you get an art degree, or any degree at a trade school.
It's good but you should outline it with a sharpie or something to clean it up. and with some basic colors you can have good drawing instead of meh. 
If you go with the normal comic book multiverse explanation, every universe occupies the same region of space but they vibrate at different frequencies so they aren't visible or tangible to one another. There are a lot of theories, if this helps.

I've been watching South Park since I'm 5, kids aren't morons. It's fine.

Netflix is doing the lord's work.
What's so inappropriate about it?

Wait since when is rick and morty in Netflix 
Obviously his purpose isn't passing butter 
(xpost /r/shittyrobots)
Wrong sub, this is more /r/richandmorto :P
Oh my god....
Did Doofus Rick build that robot? 
Took me longer than I'm willing to admit to realise the gif ended.

i swear 9/10 posts here are related to the cute little butter robot
N.E.P.T.R
so he tried to make [this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZbxWvc9O6M)
Why is this so fucking hilarious 
Can't even pass butter, sheesh.
r/therewasanattempt
He couldn't pass butter, so he tries to kill himself? Has this butter been assimilated or something?
/r/shittyrobots
His only purpose was to be part of this short gif. He is now without purpose.
Is this the same guy that had the sausage slicing bot? He's just missing his wine if so.
Hey we can't all be Rick

Just like me irl. Failing in its purpose.

Who cares though.
Can't even do that right.
Now I wish I'd bought a mindstorms set

its like it is drunk
to pass the butter.... YOU HAD ONE JOB
YOU HAD ONE JOB!!!!!
Your robot sucks at its job.
"You whore karma"
Created sick; commanded to be well
Failure

It reminds me more of the pie throwing robot from Adventure Time for some reason...the face I think. 
Dude, you should buy a longer cable IMO
I'm not programmed for hardship 
Love how his face turns sad when he realizes he cant pass the butter
Makes me think of that hilarious [muscly ketchup robot video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C3D0rcFXrY)
HIATUS
You generate karma
Crazy that in the next hundred years we could possibly create beings that have an existential crisis. It's like having a child but without any of the boring stuff.
The best part is that his face is always happy as soon as he's going for the butter, but any time he's not going for it or messes up, he has a sad face.
You fall off the table
It did pass the butter the first time - then it passed out.
Smartass robots..
I like how he goes D: as he runs for the side of the table
Rofl the face when he can't pass the butter, perfect.
OP, would like to know how you did it! 
Poor craftsmanship.
I'm just going to hand this thing in and get an F.

A few things: 
> 
> Annie, his apprentice

Annie is not Dr. Blooms apprentice, she just works in the park. 
> 
> Xenon is a pretty clever guy

Is he though? He does offer to stay behind when really he should have known that he could operated the bone train from inside.  Like this was not his first day on the job.  


> she tells Rick she can build the park.
> she does.

False, to quote Rick, "Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise!"

Another flaw with your theory is the fact that Annie only escapes ponchos clutches AFTER he is bitten by bubonic plague. I'm sure most people would panic after being bitten by a deadly disease of that nature.

I love Richard and Mortimer! Wubba wubba wub wub!! Haha
No Mortimer Jr? Disappointed. Also who would name their cat Sontag.
Any details on this? The background is a near-exact copy of Brandon Sanderson's [Way Of Kings](http://www.tor.com/2010/03/01/micahel-whelans-cover-for-brandon-sanders-the-way-of-kings/) art by Michael Whelan. 
Really nice art! Is there a 1080p version of this?
Props to the artist, this is Rickdiculously cool
The intention was to drop Rick and Morty into classic sci fi scenes, sort of like they'd appeared in that dimension. This one has sold out, but there is another...

As much as I like Rick and Morty, anyone else feel like this picture would be better without Rick?
There is a typo, one line says Rich and Morty 

But other than that good read
/r/Google might know. That's more a question about how the YouTube app functions....
Imdb ranking doesn't mean much. It's full of vote brigading. 
IMDb rankings are useless and should be ignored entirely.
Invader Zim is criminally underrated.  I started watching a few episodes after a decade hiatus and had to marvel at how ahead of its time it was.
That list doesn't even make sense - Rick and Morty only has 2 seasons. When it develops more, there's a larger possibility of quality drop which means that there's a larger possibility of the rating dropping
Band of Brothers still #1
What happens when it gets to #1? I'll spoil it for you -- nothing!
Keep it up? Another year until until next season?
It's been up there for a while now. 
If only it had more than 2 seasons. 
So next year it will be number 1 right?
So. Good.
We've probably spent at least one episode following around another pair of Rick and Morty.
[I've fallen for *that* one before...](http://i.imgur.com/INDdJM7.jpg).

Just kidding, no way Rick is dying.
Plot twist Rick and Morty end up dying and the story is based around jerry 
Cmon guys we know roiland is on here... 

STOP PUSHING HIM TO KILL RICK GODDAMIT
what if he dies and morty is filled with so much guilt that he becomes schizophrenic and from now on is just morty who sometimes sees his dead grandpa
Who said the show won't be called just "Morty" from then on?

Never doubt what Roiland and Harmon could do. They're crazy.
And also, he loses a bet if he dies in a cage.
none of y'all remember 8 simple rules do ya? 

Main character died, they kept it right on going. 
Wait...is this an actual thing? People think he's going to die in prison?
I could see them doing an 8 episode story arc of just "Morty." Just 8 full episodes of good ole Morto.
That doesn't mean anything in this day and age. I mean, look at Game of Thrones when Sir Gameofthrones was beheaded. 
Roiland said he wanted to kill off characters then bring them back w/out explanation like other shows, could just be saving it until now to fuck all expectations. 
Just nose-laughed, thanks
But there are millions of Ricks,... it's not important for the main plot if this specific Rick dies. We don't even know if we followed only one Rick this whole time.
Let's be real though they aren't going to kill of the rickiest rick and the mortyiest morty probably a prison break maybe with the council of ricks helping or Mortys from other timelines 
Where did you find this revolutionary bit of lore? This changes EVERYTHING!
Unity to save the day
how many ricks have we seen die already? 6?7?
Title card changes to "Jerry and Morty" for season three.
The whole point of Rick and Morty is that anything is possible in an infinite universe. I feel like they put Rick in jail to make this point. Don't worry.. he'll be out in no time. 
Rick and Rolled
[Are you sure?](http://overmental.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rick-and-morty-ricks-station-750x413.jpg)
Huh. Well I'll be damned. 
Thing is, if there was any show where they would kill off the title character of the show it would probably be this one.
Two words: "Rape piñata..."
Well, we have infinite amount of Ricks in the multiverse so i don't see why this one can't die. Heck, how can you even be sure that if in s03 Rick doesn't die in prison it's the same rick that got arrested in the s02 finale?
With a show that goes through different universes, this makes no sense. There are tons of ricks. He won't die, but he could, and it would still be called rick and morty.
Even if he did there are many many more...
Honestly, I like to believe, that during the show we follow the story of a particular Rick and Morty couple. All other characters can change (as did the father, and all that, and change, as in be from another universe), but Rick and Morty is the "same" always. So personally, I think there's going to be a resolution that avoids the whole "lols that's a different couple" thing.
Rick goes to prison. Morty then gets reassigned to that one fucked up Rick that likes Jerry. Cue a couple episodes with wacky Rick and Morty going on crazy adventures with the Rick taking him to fantastical and incredible places that the OG Rick wouldn't take him because it didn't further his own goals. OG Rick then comes back to get Morty via incredibly violent ways (like the wars he and Bird-person went through because Bird-person isn't there anymore to hold him back) and wants to run away with Morty so he can bring down the Galactic Federation once and for all.  Morty realizes that the OG Rick is pretty much a horrible person and chooses wacky rick over him. Wacky Rick decides to get the council involved to take down the know very dangerous criminal. With Morty's help he convinces the council to create an army to track down OG Rick. But by the time the council and the galactic federations armies catch up to him he's already taken over multiple worlds and has a massive army as well. Cue a huge fight scene with confusion on all sides, even friendly fire. Eventually it becomes clear that OG Rick is losing this battle. Cue scene like [this](https://youtu.be/cWfK5JyD2bA?t=44) and OG Rick breaks down when he's clearly been outmatched. The collective federation and council decide that they can't take any more chances and need to execute OG Rick right there. They ask if he has any last words and he uses them to apologize to Morty for being so selfish and short sighted. Morty forgives him. OG Rick is killed. Next episode the family is trying to cope with living with a new Rick when something absolutely horrible happens to the council and the federation. A giant flying Cthulu monster kills and takes out most of the council. Wacky Rick decides they need more help and breaks into a secret chamber on the Council Planet known only by council members. The room contains the means to just straight up bring anyone back to life. Wacky Rick and Morty then bring OG Rick back. They then enact this crazy scheme involving Cthulu babies. End of the day OG Rick is victorious and saves the council. He says that there a bunch of pussies and he saved the day single-handedly so they need him to stick around. The council doesn't really go for it though and they think he's still a horrible person deep down. He then reveals what he saw when he was dead. There was an after-life. And he went straight to hell where Satan finally got his revenge on OG Rick. He definitely doesn't want to go back there so he agrees to be tracked by the council and is forced into being a member. Morty finally gets his Rick back and they go back home to be a stronger family now that Rick has basically been forced to chill a little bit.
quality shitpost

After seeing all of these "Why Rick Won't Die Posts" I hope the creators change the title sequence for the first episode to "Morty created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon" , flash to rick getting shot in the head in prison, then play the normal title sequence again just to fuck with you all
Dan Harmon has clarified that the Rick and morty we follow are the same in every episode.
Red Arrow!
SPOILERS damn it
Just because a character's name is in the title doesn't mean the show can't continue without them.  

"Blake's 7" continued after blake left/died.
>the entire season is set in prison.
"I believe they call that plot armor"
That's just what the creators want you to think 
Has this guy even seen the show?
We've seen Rick as a pickle fighting off rats. If this Rick stays in prison, it will just replace another.
I'm going deeper, Leo.
Well it could be another Rick. Maybe the poop eating Rick?
Dude tag this NSFW as a spoiler for any of our friends who haven't watched all of the show yet!
Big if tru 
Because it would make for a pretty boring-ass show.
We no longer are in the original earth of episode 1. Why wouldn't our rick, be replaced by another time line rick? It's happened before with Jerry.
This doesn't make sense to me. I'm color blind btw, if that matters.
RIP and Morty
You guys excited for season 3 of and Morty? I sure am!
Y'all act as if there aren't infinite timelines
You make a strong argument. 
Coheed and Cambria have been dead for the majority of the bands existence.
Have you not heard of Morty and Morty though...
On tonight's episode of and Morty...
Genius
Well, this is exactly why we have Rich for.
Who actually thought this? 
I can't wait for season 3 of *"and Morty"*!
Also because he loses a bet if he dies in a cage
It's Rich and Morto now... I'm sorry
Good theory!
and there is countless of ricks in different universes and timelines
Rick is both dead and alive
Can't we just start watching S3 from a dimension where Tammy wasn't a Agent and didn't kill birdperson?
Pretty sure nobody who isn't mentally retarded ever thought that this was a possibility.
And Morty sounds good to me
Honestly I think next season will open up just as a normal day and completely disregard the reality of the former season. Seeks likely
Arrested Development did it with the father. I don't see why Rick and Morty can't do it with the Grandfather.

NO TOUCHING!
The entirety of season 3 could be one episode where Rick dies in prison.
The Council of Ricks would also prevent him from staying in prison because he knows too much. So, if someone is going to break him out it will be them. 
A Rick can die. In fact, Ricks have died multiple times in the show. 
Rick Sanchez C-132 is the one that never died in the show so far.
I thought this was a clickbait YouTube thumbnail.
Dang...2deep4me.
This is also the argument that Rick *himself* would be most likely to use!
no
At this point, I'm wondering whether or not Justin and Dan had any idea where they were to go from the end of season 2 and essentially just let the fans write the beginning of season 3 for them. They're intelligent guys, but I have this feeling that they wouldn't have came up with the idea that we were following an entirely different set of Rick & Morty's.
Keep this up and they'll write it in just to prove a point.
[I wouldn't be so sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObD35ylJzMw)
but when though?
Not if [this](https://youtu.be/ObD35ylJzMw) is the new intro.
If you've watched the show Cuckoo on Netflix you'll know this isn't always the case
The title sequence for S3E1 should have Rick removed from all the scenes, and the title card should read *Morty & Summer*.  
I don't understand, you circled Rick's name and have an arrow pointing to it--what's the joke?  
No one said he would, dinglefuck. 
Only GRRM doesn't give his protagonists plot armor. I like to be proven wrong Roiland.
Nice post Op. Every notice how super fans can ruin everything with their stupid theories?  Its a funny CARTOON people! Just relax and stop trying to read so much into a fucking cartoon
Like I said before, the first episode of season 3 will start with "and Morty"

Good Christmas for you, friend
Why there is no Mortor?
Cozmo's badass - I own one. The blocks he lifts weigh 40g - he can't do whole cubes, but I'm sure could carry a few pads... they'd have to have the usual CV markers for Cozmo to see them.

The "app mode" is cute, but it's really cool if you know Python. My next project is taking that little face and seeing if I can get another Cozmo to read it - that would allow for a visual comms protocol and teaching/learning. It's a cool toy for $180.
That's cozmo based off of wall-E robot "mo"

Hello Lawsuit :)
Conglaturation. You answered your own question.

This post basically sums up the entire subreddit as we wait for Season 3.
Not much to add here...
They must have done horrible things to him in prison, with his right arm being 1.5 times as long as his left.
I love the random purple blob next to him.
I've never considered the idea that some of the R&M universes are flatlands. I mean I should've seen it coming since [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/ULu5LNe.png) exists, which is an example of the conceptual opposite.
No public restroom? Heresy! A true Rick would never support such an establishment!

Now introducing WRIGGITY-WRIGGITY-WRAAAPPS, SOOOOONNNN!!!!!!
Hes from the hey arnold style universe
The butter was in the fridge...... hello?
Well the show probably wouldn't go anywhere, the whole reason he goes on these crazy adventures or gets into problems is because of Morty. Rick also cares deeply about his family and especially Morty and without him present I feel the show would mainly be Rick watching tv and drinking 
For those who watch doctor who, rick is the doctor and Morty is the companion. Morty is there to give rick  perspective.
Morty is the more sympathetic side. Rick doesn't give a fuck. 
I agree that Morty is a driving force in the show. Remember in the Pluto episode how bored rick was without him? 
Also the evil Morty in the final episode points to him maybe kicking ass later... maybe busting rick out of his prerickament in space jail...
Self high five on that pun
would've killed for one those dolls when I was 14. minus the alien kid
Authoritarians are the enemy. All forms of censorship are bad.
I'm just stoked that this show is now so popular (and profitable) that they'll be able to get away with more and more as time goes by. Oohwee, people power!
Haha the ending to that article...
I wonder if the purple shit in the shit eating episode was a censorship decision, or a "what's in proper taste" decision
I was just rewatching season 2 and I noticed this strange discrepancy with K. Michael. He's supposed to be a Gromflomite, but he doesn't seem to have mandibles like other Gromflomites, but two slits. They could be scars, but if you look at the female in the locket he kisses before he begins killing, she also doesn't have mandibles, but slits instead, and she seems perfectly fine. He also seems to have two claws, when the rank and file Gromflomites seem to only have one on their hands.

What if K. Michael isn't even a Gromflomite? We know from Rick & Morty's encounter during the first episode that the Gromflomites exist in every dimension, and they're so powerful that every single rick in every single reality saw the need to protect themselves, either by shielding their brainwaves with a Morty or by banding together and joining the Council of Ricks.

What if K. Michael isn't a Gromflomite, but rather a member of a race destroyed by the Gromflomites in their rise to interdimensional power. Maybe he's a Gromflomite from a particular dimension where they're slightly different, and their species was wiped out by the Gromflomites after choosing not to join the Gromflomite Empire.

Alternatively, what if K. Michael ***is*** a real Gromflomite, and the soldiers we see are some kind of clone army. They all seem to be identical in appearance, they have the same voice, they tend to all act similarly. Conversely, even the Female in the locket has more than a few differences in features from K. Michael, such as her hair, eye size, head shape and length of antenna.

Either way, it seems like he's getting revenge on the Gromflomites. He accepted a job to break into an Interdimensional Prison, and he broke in almost casually. What's more, it seems to me that he killed far more often than necessary, going out of his way to kill them in creative and acrobatic ways. When he cuts the ground out from under the one guard and uses the other's hand to open the door, he could have just as easily just cut the floor out from the other side of the door, but instead chose to kill those two guards.

Anywho, just my ravings on the subject. Does anyone know the current theories about this?
Dan Harmon kind of mentioned how he is a "more evolved version" of a Gromglomite. Don't have source, too lazy!
Different race? Gender? Economic class? Had some work done?
Also his eyes are way smaller
Oowee here i go posting again...
Sharp observation!
Also, we really need season 3 don't we...
During live commentary of one of the episodes of season 2 (Sorry I cant recall and not bothered too) Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland said there are different races of Gromflomites. Such as in Season 2 finale, we can see the same kind Gromflomites on the TV.
Are black people and asian people the same species? Basically the same question, they look different enough. These guys are probably cousins. 
Is it said that he is? I've never thought they were same.
The Gromflomites that appear on TV at the end of season 2 look the same as K Mike. 
I like how he always has an extreme :3 face.
I wonder if he is a gromflomite,  but a higher caste one?  Or of a later stage metamorphosis?  Juveniles have single claws and mandibles, late stage have retractable mandibles and dual claws?
K Mike has small non-compound eyes, unlike the Gromflomites.
He has only one small set of antennae (or ears), whereas the Gromflomites have a second larger set. K Michael wears clothes, but the Gromflomites are naked. K mike does not have wings. Really I could go on, but there's little evidence to support Krombopulos Michael being a Gromflomite. 
Oh boy here I go killing again 
I feel special and blessed. Thank 
The answer is don't think about it.

You gotta give people a spectacle, if a giant flying man appeared over your house, and disappeared just as quickly, would you not have many questions? Now, if said man, blows up and rains guts and viscera down upon you, wouldn't you have less questions?
Maybe his shrinking device doesn't work on anything too big? Probably why he didn't just shrink himself and the car instead
Im Just guessing, maybe he need to gigantify his shrinking, leaving a small rouben but a planet size shrinking divise.
Another reason why: it's Ricks fucking show
What if rick dies and so does Morty and it turns out that the main character was Jerry all along
That prison didn't utilize cages.
Ooh wee, is season 3 out yet?
The One True Morty will save Rick. For the balance of the multiverse.
Edit: I am wrong, I just pass butter. OH. MY. GOD.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-xREfdihtY
I was about to ask if it was really necessary to have 4 panels to tell this one thing and then I remembered the episode this is from. Love this show 
Unless that particular bet was to bird person.  #fucktammy
I disagree. Ricks die all the time.

Theres a chance the Rick in jail isn't our Rick anyway. He's just in the picture because our Jerry is in this universe. 
Doesn't mather if he dies. Infinite universes. WUBULUBADUBDUB!!

Life is insignificant.
Wow this is actually a solid observation that probably has some deep implications on ricks backstory
Haha there's no season 3 

Abandon all hope

:(
He'll be rescued because the robot's programming is to "Pass Rick Butter"...
I'm calling it now. The Rick that turned himself in is a robot, just like that evil rick from season 1. 
I'm hoping Snowball and the rest of the dog army help out in some way.
I thought it was because he was the titular character?
My theory: the family doesn't know he's in prison, and Rick's lost any motivation to leave. I think a group of inmates will plan a riot, which Rick will not be a part of, and the guards ask him for help, promising a pardon (and his ship back) if he helps save the prison.

Another thing I'd love to see is a story arc throughout the season where Jerry can't hold any of the jobs that he is assigned to. I think it'd be really good if it was in one episode, used as comic relief during Rick's pardon, and when Rick comes home, he looks Jerry straight in the eyes and says "GET A JOB, JERRY!" Followed by a scene where Jerry starts feeling depressed, walking down the street until he stops at a pawn shop that sells Sci-Fi merchandise (aliens think it's racist, so it's almost out of business), and gets hired there

I would definitely prefer something I don't expect, though.
Calling it, he's going to die in prison. And whoever he placed this bet with is going to come to collect, reviving him in the process. 
[Well, he’s not in a cage actually.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ILoL-zMbqg8/maxresdefault.jpg)
Came from /r/all. Thought this was a post about The Walking Dead...
AND because his name is the first thing in the show title.  
There's a million dimensions where Rick didn't turn himself in. Knowing Rick, he probably just got a Rick from a dimension where he wanted to turn himself in and brought him back to good old C-137.
He won't die in prison because they won't kill the title character of the show on the first episode of the third season.  Also, your reason.
Why is this cut into 4 segments? It's the same image.
Justice for Rick and Bird person!
Because an infinite universe of ricks couldn't possibly bail him out...
Maybe they'll go full on Game of Thrones here 
But what if the bet was with Bird Person?
Wait what if this is referencing to prison... Rick manages to get out of the cage, this is due to there being multiple realities, what if Morty, creates two realities, and in one Rick manages to escape, this leaves one reality with a rick stuck in jail, now Rick would have to be certain that he has escaped or that the other Rick  hasn't, rick then shoots his alternate self (the one still in jail?) Rick would be free, he then creates a new dimension that has the same properties as the current dimension?

Or I forgotten what episode it is, but Rick mentions to Morty that they would visit the dimension that the dogs live on? What if they help Rick escape?
Technically he's not in a cage, it's a cell
Too bad Skwanchy probably died while trying to buy Rick and his family more time to escape,  he'll never get that drink Rick owes him now.
Objectively speaking no matter how much you like rick  he deserves to die in prison. 
He isn't contained in a cage in the space prison, he's just restrained on a wall. Therefore, he would not lose the bet.
they did die.
And his asshole is already loose too.
The end of season 2 was actually just another universe the family was watching on the tv and Rick comments that the other Rick is and idiot for giving himself over to the police.
Except he DOES die in prison, an effectively infinite number of times, and he also DOESN'T die in prison an effectively infinite number of times. Infinite number of realities, remember?
But there's infinite Ricks.
He's not in a cage though. He's strapped to a pillar.
We each of us die in a cage

or you know, maybe it's called rick and morty
Makes f...fucking sense, biiiitch !
burfy turfy taft weasels pissants croissant 
Rick's too independent to get rescued, he'll escape himself, under the cover of an attack by Snowball and the cyberdogs
 What if the bet was to Bird person? 
But he's not in a cage he is strapped to a wall
My guess, season 3 starts with no reference to Rick in prison and just goes right into another dimension's zany adventure.
He's not really in a cage though 
I love random throw-away lines about Rick's past... this line, and the "You gotta turn into a car" line, are two of the funniest moments for me.
I prefer the theory that the show is called Rick and Morty... **RICK...** He kinda **NEEDS** to be in it, or else it's just *The Morty Show*, which sounds lame.
Well.... considering the finite curve rick has and will again die in a cage
Rick isn't in a cage tho...
I gotta watch this show some time.

I guess I know Rick goes to prison now.
Except he's not in a cage, he's in some device that holds his hands and legs.
It's disturbing to me that the piece of dirt or rock or whatever that's next to the sock on the floor in the background, keeps changing in each of those panels.
yeah but they didnt put him in a cage in prison, the just chain him to the wall
4 panels with his leg moving ever so slightly? 
who cares if rick dies though? they'll just replace him with another rick from another universe. they've already done that on the show,  multiple times if you subscribe to some theories. 
that doesn't proof anything
It would be fucking awesome if he did, kinda like Kamina from Gurren Lagann, where the audience gets attached to him but he's killed off so early so that the audience cries their asses off, realizes the show isnt over, and continues to see the story shifts over to morty who avenges him.
is this just the same frame split four times? 
This didn't need 4 screencaps of the same image
le rick is in prison?!?!?!? i hope he stays in prison forever so he can never make his stupid show again.
You got my hopes up and then instantly dashed them.

I hope you stub your toes. Each and every one of them.

I'm pretty sure they have the same animation team all around, they just told em to spice it up a bit. Like the "Two brothers" and "Jan Quadrant Vincent 16", Since they had very different animation styles.
In the commentary of the episode they said Dominic (the director) story boarded/keyframed it, and Caroline animated it ones.

He doesn't say that we shouldn't think about our place in the universe, but rather stop fixating on those things over which you have no control. Obsessing about how you're a tiny speck of dust in the universe will not benefit you in any imaginable permutation of reality, ever. Freaking out about it is counterproductive. In the time you wasted thinking about that, you could have done/thought about something that could have the potential to reshape the course of the entire universe.

Why do you think Rick is constantly drunk?
The zen master once said to his student, "dont think of a carrot." 

Naturally, the student thought of the carrot. 

So when rick says to morty after they warp to the dimension where they just died, "what about the reality where hitler cured cancer?" He is saying to morty, "dont think of a carrot." 
Morty thinks about it, then he suppresses it by buring his dead counterpart. He has been awoken to the cosmic horror show.
Rick does care about morty, but is himself  so numb due to all the horror he has witnessed across dimensions that he uses drugs and alcohol to quiet his mind. Morty does none of that, he's an innocent protector, a guardian angel to Rick (who may or may not be morty's great (x 100) grandson from the future that fathered beth, we'll have to find out). 
You just don't give a shit, or just enjoy the fact that your life is meaningless, therefore who cares what you do?
That's some impressive lettering work. Kudos to your friend!

[I had something similar](http://i.imgur.com/aBTCcpF.jpg)
[deleted]
I always thought Morty would dig up dead Rick and get his portal gun and use that to do some badass shit to get prison Rick back. Or he'll just cash in that replacement Morty ticket and write fanfiction about himself and him doing it... I don't know...
Yeah man I noticed this as well. She says that the  world she was currently in would get her accepted into the Galactic Federation which would give her access to countless other planets and species, which she would "unify". She then said she would become the universe and a "god". If she's allowed to have access to the Galactic Federation then maybe she can unify them to get Rick out of prison? They have so many ways they can really play out his escape and this can certainly be one.
I doubt it would be "to get her long lost lover back" but it could be at Morty's request?
Not a bad idea; right up there with my idea that somehow (either influenced by Morty or not) a Birdperson shows up from another reality or dimension to save Rick. 

Not a perfect idea but better than my other really shitty idea of Morty finding one more use for a Plumbus...
That's a good one..    I hope so!

My thought was maybe evil morty will free this rick..  earlier in the episode is it evil morty who says every rick needs a morty, and every morty needs a rick

>And in some of those, it is guaranteed that one of those infinite universes will target our universe with the pure intention of destroying it.

this line indicates that you have some fundamental misunderstandings regarding infinite, specifically regarding infinite sets and their relative sizes.

>let's say there's a Rick smarter than C-137 Rick

do you have any justification for this assumption?
There are infinte numbers between 1 and 2, none of them are 3
its not possible to go to another universe. BAM disproved
I realize this is a semi-old post, but still, this is relevant.


Infinite universes =/= infinite possibilities.

- Suppose I have an infinite set of numbers.

- Suppose that this set of numbers contains only EVEN numbers. There are no odd numbers in this set. Something like (2, 4, 6, 8...)

The set is infinite, as there are an infinite amount of even numbers. However, even though the set is infinite, there is no odd numbers.

I can replace sets of numbers with universes and even numbers with some any other variable. Examples:

- An infinite amount of universes, but No Man's Sky is always a dissapointment.

- An infinite amount of universes, but there are always two world wars.

Or in this case...

- An infinite amount of universes, but none of them have the desire to destroy our universe.

This allows for infinite universes while avoiding most of the issues posed by the multiverse theory. Does it still go against Occam's Razor? Debatable. But it solves the issue you proposed with the multiverse theory.
I really wanna hear what other people think about this. I don't 100% agree with this theory but I have no way to prove it.
I'd also like to mention Rick Potion #9 where he says that they only have 3 or 4 identical universes left where Rick and Morty die at the right time to be replaced.
I think rick is trying to say there ARE infinite possibilities, but it would take forever to sort through all of them. 

This is brought up quite often when they discuss the "central finite curve". It is shown when rick and morty Cronenberg the world. Rick pulls out his goggles and searches for a universe that him and morty can go to and says "we get 3-4 of these tops". The same goggles are seen in intergalactic television episodes, for jerry and beth. Those goggles match up dna to a percentage and use the finite curve to find universes that are similar. 

With that being said, there is potentially infinite universes outside of the finite curve, but rick and the council of ricks don't pay attention to those dimensions. 

Its difficult to explain, however if you scour reddit with central finite curve the topic will come up with fairly good discussions. One example when discussing the infinite is "if you put a monkey at a type writer for all of time, eventually it will type the complete works of William Shakespeare perfectly" but that would take forever

I would ask [But Why?](http://i.imgur.com/Br00TCn.gifv) but I already know why. So we can cross-reference with other fan theories to see if they break apart or are confirmed. Of particular note as an easy target would be to see which fan theories break when we assume the wood-floor kitchen marks a jump to a different universe, and that each wood-floor kitchen is the same universe. 

Remember, everything drawn is 100% on purpose because it's animated, they had to look at each individual frame for a considerable amount of time. And plus, we're talking about Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon here, of course everything is intentional and meant to fuck with us.

I just realized that they could easily justify a live-action segment of Rick and Morty via dimension-hopping.
ITS FUCKING AWFUL


I love it
You know it's good when rick looks exactly like Christopher Lloyd
It looks like they're at a light jog hah
Where do i get one?
I'm going to sell some prints soon but I'm auctioning off the original on Ebay. 
their eyes are too small
But he's banging Beth...
No. You're dumb. http://imgur.com/wn01B0r
I could see that.  solid thought 👍 
Yo, this is really bad timing. I want to get one of these for someone as a Christmas gift but you'd be SOL getting it in time.
Nice
It all comes down to Pepe Sylvia... Pepe Sylvia... Pepe Sylvia. Who IS Pepe Sylvia? And here's the thing: There is no Pepe Sylvia.
I can't get over how live this sub is while the show is off the air.
Rick: You know what Morty, give this guy a cigarette, he's freaking out

Jerry: Huh who?

Rick: Morty. He's the guy who tipped me off to Mr. Meseeks.

Jerry: MESEEKS? WHO THE HELL IS MESEEKS?

Rick: YOU DONT SEE ME- oh shit. Where the hell did he-

Jerry: You've lost your mind. You lost your goddamn mind Rick!

I’ve been dying to talk about the parasites with you all day, OK Morty? “Poopy Butthole,” this (burping)name keeps coming up over and over again. Every day Poopy's mail is getting sent back to me. Poopy Butthole! Poopy Butthole! I look at the mail, and th-this whole box is Poopy Butthole! So I say to myself, Morty, I say “I gotta find this guy! I gotta go up to his apartment and put his mail in the guy’s goddamn hands! Otherwise, he’s never going to get it and he’s going to keep coming back down here.” So I go up to Poopy's office and what do I find out, Morty? What do I find out?! There-there is no Poopy Butthole, Morty. The man does not exist, okay? So I decide, “Oh shit, buddy, I gotta dig a little deeper.” There’s no Poopy Butthole? You gotta be kidding me! I got boxes full of Poopy! All right Morty. So I start marchin’ my way down to Amish Cyborg and I-I-I knock on his door and I say, “Cyborg! (Burping)Cyborg! I gotta talk to you about Poopy.” And when I open the door what do I find Morty? There-there’s not a single goddamn bad memory in my brain! There…is…no…Amish Cyborg
What's the name of this meme it's proper bugging me!
I'm gonna get ree- *burp* reeeeeal weird with it, Morty
Any have links to really good fan theories?
I'm a lawyer. I specialize mostly in bird person law.
Carolllll carolll 
People call theories about Game of Thrones or Westworld "tinfoil" when they're out of the mainstream.

Have you heard Dan Harmon's podcast, Harmontown?  The creator of Rick and Morty is beyond tinfoil himself.  All theories about Rick and Morty are worth listening to, especially when you consider that Harmon is the down-to-Earth and more grounded influence between him and co-creator Justin Roiland, who is a mad man in the most wonderful way.

Tinfoil away.

Edit:  I got downvoted for this?
I'm new to the show, ready to listen. Give me a softball explanation of one of the more common fan theories
that scene in always sunny is a perfect comparison for the conspiracy theorists on the_donald because he's even talking about "pepe" silvia

Fuck who's that guy from? I recognize him
There should be infinite bird persons and Tammys, hell im pretty sure the Bp from Cronenberg earth would be fine, he lived on a different planet right? And if Rick knew him since he was a teenager/younger? it should be the Bp from that universe he knows. So is there only 1 Bp for some reason or something?

What is this, a crossover episode?
This is the best part of the show. It is an easy watch on the surface and easy to enjoy. But the show has layers to it. Under the surface there is a lot more to enjoy for those that want a to go there. This makes the show so much more appealing to different audiences. And when they are drawn in, they can dig deeper as they become more and more of a fan. There is always more to enjoy about the show.

I think it was all sort plod last minute planning because it honestly sounds like their writing plan is a little scrambled (still the best show ever tho)
I think that the writers and justin Roiland will make up what ever they have to, to keep the audience on their feet, even if it goes against logic. So yeah, i do believe that the writers just made up the idea in the second season.
in universe? yes.  
in writing? maybe.
If you go off the comics Tammy has been around for a long time as a minor character. Never goes on adventures but is always around summer. Theres even the party where they all get wrecked. Shes been eating bird *beep* for years in this timeline and I have no idea where im going with this and made some stuff up and seriously fuck Tammy.

Had to read that title a couple of times
I've never seen Event Horizon but that scene also always reminded me of Room 1408 when the room brings his daughter back and then turns her into dust.
It wouldn't surprise me if that influenced the scene as well. Event Horizon is basically if The Shining were a splatter space opera. I've never seen 1408 so I just connected it to Event Horizon. 

There's no evidence. This is entirely speculation on the part of gamerguide. I just read a different article on that same site saying that there likely would be no episodes this year. Again, no evidence to back it up either way. If there's going to be new episodes, we most likely will hear about it more than a month before they air. 
fuck off with this.
That moment when you realise that the Galactic Federation has a better ethics code than the United States...
The Galactic Federation aliens seem to never be torturing people or using unnecessary violence, even though Rick suggests they would torture his family for info on his whereabouts. I think they see capturing Rick as a matter of business and galactic safety and not some kind of vengeance. 
I once had a job that wasn't better than passing butter. Hand polishing anodised sheets of steel that were being made into Mini badges.

I hate Mumunmununsdays.  I could sure go for some enchiladas.
if they ever need to hire a voice actor...
I knew this dude was talented, but GOD DAMN these are the best impressions of anything I have ever seen. Rick was not perfect, but the Morty...

In all honesty, I did go to Wikipedia and look if Justin Roiland was really not just an alias of Chris Ray Gun.
I'm more curious about Beth's Mom/Mrs. Sanchez. 
And that's why I always say, 'Shumshumschilpiddydah!'

^(**|** *`Don't be Rickdiculous. I do more than pass butter`*)

I doubt it, there's still a lot of unanswered questions about Rick's wife, Beth, Rick, etc.

It would be cool if we saw an episode where Rick chills with his parents but idk there hasn't even been a remote mention of them ever but Rick's wife has been mentioned before
Rick is Morty's son. There was obviously some weird time travel but it creates an interesting loop. It is actually why Mortys' shield ricks.
Doo-dah doo doo!
Unity might be Beth's mom. She didn't inherit the hive mind abilities but in her personality she is a control freak.
Real life Jerry made that ad.
Hmmm. Human clothes... I like them!
oh I really hope so.... cause I really want another go at that Roy game.  I've messed mine up pretty bad and should probably just hit reset.
I go between Rick & Morty and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. When I don't know what to watch, those are my go to

I could watch the purge episode all day... and the Nightman Cometh from IASIP
Whoa. I love you 
Did you really watch season 2 before season 1?

After three attempts and getting the color wrong on the first two tries, I now just need to get the damn marbles to stay where I want them instead of floating toward the edges of the sculpture.

Sculpted in polymer clay, then I made a mold and cast it in clear resin. Tried marbles in the first two, then gems in the third, I think I will go back to marbles for the next attempt.

One idea I had was that Rick would actually die in prison, and be replaced with another Rick, but that is a long shot.
Might be interesting to get some back story, giving us an idea as to the extent of rick's crimes and what adventures he and birdperson got up to before the events of the show... maybe what he was doing for the 20 years before he moved into beth's house. but knowing rick & morty, i think what the original poster suggested might be accurate. I think harmon and roiland are going to try and subvert our expectations. Possibly by having an episode as described and then like a couple of minutes kind of glossing over rick's escape to annoy people that what they'd been wating for for give or take 2 years was almost entirley ignored. Bear in mind (at least so I've heard) harmon & roiland have said that rick's imprisonment won't affect much of the plot of the new season i.e. they'll get back into the swing of things quite quickly.
90% sure it starts with rick not in jail and no explanation. 

I wouldnt be surprised if the jailbreak was the season finale.
I liked it. Sad how it ended. The interdimensional cable episode was as disappointing as the subreddit it inspired, which makes me think they'll never make that lightning strike twice. 
Okay but did you cry?
Probably Lawnmower dog because of the where are my testicles quote.

I mean Morty, we are ever so seriously fucked right now.

It's so bad it almost seems intentional,  like they are going for a Roiland ad-libing sort of feel...  But she wasn't,  she's just a bad writer. She wasn't going for an ad-lib feel.   It's just that the writing was bad.   Instead of doing it on purpose for comedic purposes like I previously suggested,  she did it on accident.   Mostly because of the fact that the writing simply wasn't that good and some would call it "bad". 
I love this.  And hate it.  You know what I mean.
Sure would be nice if Rick and Morty could be an oasis away from politics. Sure would be nice...

An someone tell me what episode this is 
Well I guess Pence and Biden have something in common then…
It is an incredibly intelligent show with a big Fuck you to the idea of life having meaning, at the same time questioning a lot of philosophical ideas on the meaning of life.

The show while watched on the surface is enjoyable, it doesn't really shine until you really pay attention to all the little comments that each character makes towards each other. This is to me where the wit of the show glows it's brightest. Something said on your first viewing of an episode might be worth a chuckle but once you watch it again and put a little thought into it, it can be scary how real the creators commentary on the subject is.

Rewatch an episode and pay attention to all the little details in comments that characters make to each other. Think about them and you will start to see why we love this show.

Rick and Morty is a TV show many people find funny.

It's fine if you don't like it, you don't have to like everything other people like.
The show may be called Rick and Morty, but the real good stuff is happening in the parent heavy episodes.
It's a silly little show by a pair of crazy people about a dimension-hopping scientist and his brain-dead grandson that will teach you more about quantum theory than most people get in school.
Neat fact: When the guy playing the arcade game wins and starts celebrating, Mr. Meeseeks disappears. The detail in this show is unreal
Best use of a meeseeks I've seen. 
I think that this eliminates them as Rick rescuers, as they're so common the GF wardens would have defences.

That the morty in the opening sequence left behind on frog world is the eyepatch morty out for revenge on ricks after surviving somehow. The rick and morty in the show we follow aren't from the same universe, rick had just assumed another ricks life in a universe where said rick is dead.

Yeah, Rick and Morty is best when they go to all kinds of crazy dimensions and worlds. 

Futurama fell into the same trap - the pilot got you hyped for lots of space travel, but most episodes just concerned stuff on Earth.
Yeah me too. My favorite episodes were the Fart one and the Interdimensional council one for the same reasons, because they had the most sci-fi concepts in them.

What just have the 1st episode as Rick hanging in jail watching inter dimensional cable whilst his family watches the same stuff at home.

All of a sudden How Did I Get Here comes on its Rick in a plumbus factory. 
On one of the commentaries, they said they might do another one for season 3.
I'm down with that, that way people will stop complaining about how "forced" it is and how "Isn't as good as the last time."

Good design, but rather -BUURP- primitive materials - what dimension are you from, the one that hasn't discovered electricity yet? Do you plan to cook that -BUURP- chicken over a campfire or something? 
One of the episodes is called "tales of the citadel", if anyone wants to take a guess on what that is going to be about to pass the time.
Some sources say it will start on December 2nd others say January 5th, so hopefully we won't have to wait much longer.
While you wait, there is a Rick and Morty comic that might hold you over. It takes places somewhere in the middle of the events of season two I believe.
Found at GameStop. Third part is Rick with portal gun. 
Their eyes are too circular... literally unpurchaseable.

GRASSSSS... tastes bad!

^(**|** *`Don't be Rickdiculous. I do more than pass butter`*)

I can't find it thru google but there is an explanation from a comicon panel somewhere
It's just preposterous that a planet would be on a cob in the first place, and then even more wild that they're scared of it. There isn't a concrete reason why it's funny other than the fact it's really stupid. 
Wait, I just realized Rick was probably doing that to confirm his suspicions that it was a simulation. Real Morty wouldn't have been so cheerful, he would have been a whiney bitch like always. Nvm
Wubbalubbadubdub!

^(**|** *`Don't be Rickdiculous. I do more than pass butter`*)

He also made him get naked in front of his grandpa so I think it all evens out.
ikr? so depressing the first time I saw this pointed out. Still not completely convinced rick did it as a 'test'...
Others have pointed out he knew morty was a sim from the very start and might never have actually been convinced - he just went along with it - so maybe it's something Rick DOES actually long to do but holds himself back from doing to a real morty? I like that theory better :) still sad lol
"For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children's futures, we're gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants?"

"Yes."

"Why??"

and here it comes...

"Because I don't want him to leave again, you dumb asshole."

That line, fucking wrecked me. Was such an emotional gut punch, I instantly had a lump in my throat. Idk, just really shows you how damaged and sad Beth is from Rick having left her early in life. That line sets up the ending perfectly, I never even knew R&M was gonna make me cry like that for at least a few minutes. I guess another line would probably be one from Rick's phonecall to the feds.
**Being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets.**  Truer words have rarely been spoken. 
Morty: That, out there, that's my grave.   
Summer: Wait, what?   
Morty: On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world, so we bailed on that reality and we came to this one, because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed and in this one, we were dead. So we came here, a- a- and we buried ourselves and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast twenty yards away from my own rotting corpse.   
Summer: So you're not my brother?   
Morty: I'm better than your brother. I'm a version of your brother you can trust when he says "Don't run." Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV.

Not a direct quote, but mine was when the ship was told to protect Summer and seemingly scanned the first guy. When his body fell apart, it was so unexpected and perfect. 
"You have to turn them on, Morty!" 

That was the instant I knew this show was special. Such a little overlooked detail that totally illustrates the show's affectionate piss-take of the sci fi genre
When the dude runs outside and gets eaten by the testicle monster, and then they play "just shake that ass bitch, and let me see what you got" one of the funniest things I've seen
Puffy vagina.
"Does the popes dick fit in a donut hole!?"
"oh boy, here i go killin' again!" 
 
so unexpected and hilarious. 
"Still here, still selling fake doors"
"He's not a hot girl, he can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's."

First episode, first couple of minutes. Knew the show would be great from that point on.
In the meeseeks episode, when Jerry and Beth are in the meat locker freezer and the 1st meeseeks just starts a soliloquy out of nowhere about how meeseeks must die in order to fulfill a purpose! It was so well-spoken and worded that it got my attention immediately and it is when i first fell in love with rick and morty.
IM ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE!
Mine was Dr Xenon Bloom. "Put that back on!"
Gonna get sappy with this one.
I spent a vast portion of my childhood dealing with parents who very obviously no longer loved each other.  Every year was me waiting for a divorce.  They dragged it out until my sophomore year.  Suffice to say, it pretty much wrecked my mental health.
I'm their only kid.  It made me think I was the reason they stayed together and were so miserable.
So the episode where Summer sees her parents' alternate lives and feels like she's to blame for their misery, yeah.  It kinda tore me up inside.  The entire plot of Beth, Jerry, and Summer really hits a little too close to home.  I didn't expect that from the show.
Oh, and Mr. Jelly Bean.  Oh my fucking Goooood.
"after I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing"
lost my shit with "Go clean the toilet! maybe you'll make friends with some turds"
Not a line, but I lost my shit when the screaming sun rose. It was so out of the blue I loved it
"Oh sweet Jesus please let me live. Oh my God, I gotta fix this thing, oh dear Lord hear my prayers, please God in heaven--
YES!

F*ck you God, not today b*tch!"

This scene was really important for me. I'm a Christian and I love God and I always have, but this line just showed me where we really are at as a society and a culture. Not everyone is going to respect God anymore than in the past, and not everyone is going to be a believer (in Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, you name it).

But I think EVERYONE, at some point in their lives, has or will come to a point where they feel so powerless and impotent that they will cry out to someone or something greater than themselves. I think it's human nature, really.

And that's not a charge for anyone to start considering religion for themselves. It's just something interesting the show made me realise.
AIDS!
"Go go Sanchez ski shoes"
"Boy, fuck you, John"
"That's like asking a horse to fix a merry-go-round; he's going to do his best, but he's going to be horrified."

I don't know why that one caught me so off-guard, but I was laughing so hard I had tears in my eye holes!
Not really a line, but when Mr Poopybutthole got shot, I could not control my laughter.
Is Mark from a universe where people have 6 fingers?
Wooba Looba dick duck!
Your SO seems to be good at art stuff. Good job.
Aw jeez Mark i don't think you should be shooting lasers around like that, it seems pretty dangerous you know?
Do you work with lasers?
How much of your work involves installing lasers on the heads of sharks?
J-just two guys...Mark and Tim. And they work with lasers. And when these two guys get going...w-watch out. Cuz tim's got lasers...on the brain. LITERALLY. But Mark...M-mark doesn't know a lot about that. But he's the major Laser...guy...of these two guys...two guys...they're just two guys.
I need you to shove this laser up your butthole, Tom. Waaaaay up your butthole.
I didn't think you guys were talking since it was announced Tom was kicked out of blink?
The other guy looks like Hank Scorpio
Is your boss named Travis? 
I'm literally surrounded by lasers.

They usually stay inside the fiber optics, however.
Tom's sick of your shit, Mark. 
This is some kind of lowkey power play to let Tom know he's not the alpha there at work.
Is anyone else having as much of a problem understanding the source of the laser or its direction? It just doesn't make sense. Is it shooting 2 beams from the crystal in different directions? And if so, why is it shooting from the crystal and not the from of the gun, like all other guns (including the portal gun). Yes, I understand I'm being "that guy", but it really doesn't make sense! 
Anyone else reminded of that Dexter's Lab game where you use mirrors to direct a laser that shoots balloons? 
Looks like Rhett &a Link.
Are the lasers meant to spell out "4D"? Does that have any significance?
Awesome, your SO gets a thumbs up

There's a nearly infinite number of other Ricks who didn't surrender. Or go to the wedding, for that matter. Linear storytelling isn't for smart people, Morty.

I can't say if it's different in Canada but I own season 2 on Google Movies.
Best advice I can offer you is to NOT WATCH THEM TOO QUICKLY there is no announced date for season 3 yet and we r losing our minds impatiently waiting 
I managed to pick up Season 2 on bluray but Season 1 seems to be only on DVD atm.

Any idea if they're planning on releasing the bluray version over in Canada?
I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT 
Considering Rick and morty is a rip on Doc & Marty I'm guessing they're not going to sic the lawyers onto you for making a few cents.
On the other hand, how would you feel if someone was making money off of your original idea?

I don't have an issue with fan art, but selling it is kind of shady regardless of the level of revenue.
It probably just means the episode you watched is going to be aired then. Now it says next week.

Was anyone else simply torn by having to decide between M. Night Shaym-aliens and Meseeks and Destroy?

Also, does anyone else find Raising Gazorpazorp to be the least interesting episode of the series? Seriously, the best part of that episode was the sex doll bit. Without that episode we couldn't have Gazorpazorpfield though, sooo...

Also they put Something Ricked against Rixty Minutes :( Breakin ma balls
I'm new to the series (UK Netflix). Binged the entire two series in a day, was totally squanched. I've watched the mr meeseeks ep several times. It's gold. Love how crazed they become.  
Anatomy Park vs Rick Potion #9 is hard. Both where hilarious. Anatomy Park was probably funnier overall but Rick Potion #9 got lovably dark and set off some substantial plot and character development.

Still, one of my favorite jokes has to have been when Jerry and Beth where fighting the Cronenberg monsters:

Jerry: "I wish that shotgun was my penis."   
Beth: "If it where, you could call me Ernest Hemingway."   
Jerry: "I don't get it and I don't need to."
Something ricked this way comes was the best damn episode in the whole series. I can't believe it lost this fast.
Shaym-aliens is the best episode in the series in my opinion. It really breaks down the "in a simulation" trope, and the final scene with Jerry is when it really settles in how smart Rick is.
I can't remember the name, but the episode where they go to the universe where they die and bury themselves was the episode I fell in love with this show.

Episodes 6,8 and 10 are the touch stones of the show, the deepest most intriguing and plot widening in the first season.  (In the top, not the entire top)
I think the episodes 'M. Night Shaym-Aliens' and 'Anatomy Park' doesn't get enough love. I think M Night Shaym-Aliens is a great episode, it has a great plot and packs a lot of jokes, same as Anatomy Park. Anatomy Park is probably one of the best Jurassic Park parodies I have seen. It has a very good and heavy plot/parody. That being said, I think Rick and Morty is a fantastic show. Every episode is built so well, but these two episodes (from the list) deserve more love. Can't wait until season 3, gonna overdose of schwifty...
"Lawnmower Dogs" is easily my favorite from Season 1. After the pilot, I remember thinking "this show is pretty cool, but I'd really like to see Dan and Justin explore what they can do with it on a conceptual standpoint." Then Ep. 2 comes along and establishes the classic Rick and Morty theme - Family wants Rick to use his science for a seemingly innocent reason, Jerry threatens to take Morty from Rick if he doesn't help, adventure ensues...

What I love about this episode is that it is so perfectly divided between the A and B story. Keeping the centric focus the development of Snowball's/Snuffles' intelligence whilst simultaneously developing and executing the inception story with poise. They juggled both stories perfectly, giving just enough attention to each, and both seemed hyper-developed. I almost forgot that I was watching a 20 minute episode and was in awe of how it all fit within the half-hour with commercials industry standard. 

Then they hit you with [one of the most beautiful and profound moments of the entire series...](https://youtu.be/i_DFKb9g-Tk) 

And this was just EPISODE 2!!

All in all, this is why "Lawnmower Dogs" is my favorite and will be a tough episode to dethrone. 
This is a great idea, I wonder if you could plot the results in a graphic similar to a tournament bracket?
So I gotta know, are the alien TV episodes General loved or hated by this fandom? I personally love the way they rant off into unthinkable shit like Two Brothers, but I've heard a lot of backlash against those episodes
Wait it's past the 21st...
Are polls really going to close on the twenty-five-erst?
Honestly the Pilot and Rixty Minutes are the two best episodes in season one IMO.  

Next two would be "M. Night Shaym-Aliens" and "Meeseeks and Destroy" 

Someone really Morty'd all over the seeding.  I get that it was the order of the episodes and all but c'mon broh
Anyone who votes for shaymaliens over meeseeks has never played golf
oh my. difficult to choose between m night shaym and meeseeks, had to go with meeseeks, but would've chosen both over most of  the others. 

I quite like it when he gets his head squanched. 
Yeah, that scene is genuinely uncomfortable. 0_0
I also skip it! 

I was sexually abused as a kid so the scene gives me anxiety (to all the motherfuckers who think trigger is a buzzword from tumblr, this is another way to say the scene triggers me. Read a fucking book, assholes). Which sucks cause the Mr. Meeseeks episode is easily one of my favorite. 
you have a very planetary mindset
It's even more disturbing knowing that Tom Kenny (Spongebob) is the voice of Mr. Jellybean. 
Hell no I don't skip it. That's Tom Kenny one of our generation's greatest voice over actors and a hilarious son of a bitch (mr show)
I laugh my ass off
Do you get triggered? Did a giant jellybean squanch you in a bathroom as a kid?

Fun Fact. Bill Waterson, the author of Calvin and Hobbes doesn't do any licensing for the strip on the belief that it'll ["cheapen the strip"](http://calvinandhobbes.wikia.com/wiki/Licensing). So if you ever see images of Calvin like this in the forms of stickers or whatever, they are actually copy write infringements unless the owner made it them self. 
I feel that Tiny Rick would be more suited for this. Just my two cents.

That's the type of shit I look for when I rewatch seasons. Good find. Never saw him lol. 
I'm pretty sure he's at the party in the last episode of season 1 too.
I'm re-watching the show and noticed that this kid was also invited to the party in Ricksy Business (also you can see the frog guy from Get Schwifty). http://i.imgur.com/hN5lBCH.png

I don't get it 
First you should take the dingle bop and smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem can repurposed for later batches.

Then take the dingle bop and push it through the grumbo, where you rub the fleeb against it. (It's important that the fleeb is rubbed, becasue the fleeb has all the fleeb juice.)

Then, get yourself a schlami so he can rub it and spit on it.

Next, cut the fleeb. You can expect there to be several hizzards in the way.

Finally, rub the blamfs against the chumbles, and shave away the plubis, and grumbo.

That should leave you with a regular old plumbus.

Good luck! I hope your cousin enjoys it!
Instead you should get a blue koosh ball and put google eyes on it and voila, a Fleeb!

You wouldn't want them to dissolve though. Nosireebob. 
You know now that I think about it, why didn't he give Morty like a condom or something to put over the seed? I mean besides contamination you know it will dissolve, why not just get something to secure it that he can also lube up to you know, make it easier on him.

Your r/gonewild posts prove otherwise.
You just gotta be in the mood to do it 
Morty, good news: since your anus isn't taut, then it should slip right in! Put those seeds up your butt, Morty! Try to get all of them. That's good, Morty! The bleeding will stop in a minute, Morty, don't worry, it's just a fissure, it means you're growing. Growing pains, Morty.
Isn't "taut" basically an antonym to "malleable"? Your title doesn't make sense, dude. 
 
Good news, it's a suppository.

Sorry, never seen R&M. Came from r/all. 
Does rick derive his intelligence from these?
Did OP, in fact, confirm he is a bundle of sticks?
I saw him yesterday and was wondering if anyone was gonna post it. 
This is why that show is great... I wonder if someone would play out Rick and Morty scenes in the show.
I love Wayne Brady, too. Really funny guy. His Dave Chappelle skit is one of my favorites from the show.
It'll probably be a jab from the writers mocking the idiots that made this a thing.

What highly distinct and unique name needs blacking out really? :D
Oh weee!
Home made plumbuses are NOTHING but bad news dude. Take my word for it
I have heard in some places they will pull the dingle bop before, but that goes against the current conventional wisdom. The consensus among most artisans today is to remove it after. But my grandfather insists insists it is ok as long as you make sure and re-purpose the schleem.
You don't take it out at all. If you did, then you'd have nothing to rub the fleeb against. Sounds like you're confusing the dingle bop with schleem. Take the schleem out before you push the dingle bop through the grumbo. Best not to get rid of that schleem, as it can be repurposed for later batches! 
For a moment I thought I was still on r/askgaybros...
Before
I recommend that you take out the dinglebop first. I actually managed to grab myself some schleem for only half a shmeckle!
Could you possibly make it a little smaller?
Also a Plumbus can not make a delicious Shepard pie but is great for getting girlfriends. 
Nope, humor is an opinion and there's no way that literally everyone would find the show funny. If you're that far in and aren't finding it hilarious, chances are you just don't enjoy that type of comedy as much as others. Nothing to feel bad about. 
I think what a lot of people find amazing about this show is that it doesn't fear the rickdiculous, and in fact embraces it while staying grounded in the stories and has often flipped the whole feel of the episode on the viewer. The ending to Auto Erotic Assimilations always hits me like a ton of bricks. 
If you have 20 minutes to spare, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWFDHynfl1E&ab_channel=Wisecrack) does a pretty good job of analyzing what's going on under the surface that makes Rick & Morty so great, in my opinion.  
But, as the other commenters here have said, it might just not be your cup of tea, and that's perfectly fine. 
The real question here is how are you watching rick and morty on netflix?
It's kind of a nerdy show that has new spins on a ton of sci-fi tropes... if you aren't into nerdy stuff you might not get a lot of the references which make it as funny as it is. In other words if you just watched this show without watching any other nerdy media or reading sci-fi you might just find it as rickdickulous as modern TV audiences would find something like Ball-Fondlers. 

Also like one of the other comments mentions, there's a big philosophical element that may not be your cup of tea if you don't find anything funny in pondering the meaning (or lack thereof) of existence. 
If you have to ask...
It's not on my Netflix, lame.
Aw geez, Rick, what a mess, huh... 
Wubbalubbadubdub!

Rich and Morto is a show that airs on Humor Headquarters. It was created by Han Darmon and Rustin Joyland. Most people think it's pretty funny, but the next season may not come for a couple of days so people are getting antsy.

The pilot sucks except for a couple scenes and Rick is drastically different after the pilot. 
The second inter dimensional TV episode.

I mean, they nailed it the first time.
Mr. Booby-buyer is the best character on the show 
Mr. Poopy Butthole and Pencilvester are great, but the best character in Total Rickall is Photography Raptor.
I don't know if it's an unpopular opinion, but Anatomy Park is my favorite episode of all time. And it's the best episode of all time.
When I hear things like the original pilot had to be changed because the words "Rick" and "Morty" were used like 200 times, I wonder what the fuck is wrong with Justin Roiland. 

"Raise the Posterior" is far superior to "Get Schwifty"

Beth and Jerry don't seem like 34 year olds. More like in their 40s. Rick is 80

Interdenominational cable II was pretty stupid. They probably won't try to pull that concept again 

Sometimes the B stories are just stupid
jokes about hamsters that leaving in human asses is not fun- once of a time it was ok, but looks like they gonna use it more
The season 2 blu-ray didn't contain a behind the scenes look like the first season did, felt a tad jipped. 
I feel like the show doesn't focus on Rich and Morto enough
Get Schwifty was the worst episode of the show. Someone got that toon in their head and half assed wrapped an episode around it.

Second interdimensional cable was an ok episode 
Uh ohhhh! Somersoult jump!

^(**|** *`Don't be Rickdiculous. I do more than pass butter`*)

Morty is a real pain in the ass sometimes
They scream all the time, the family that is, especially Morty so I have to lower the volumen everytime. 
They hype around the show is ruining the show.

A bit like Borat.
Rick And Morty doesn't deserve it's rating on IMDB. It's good but not that good
I'm worried with the new women writers they will pull away from the fun of the show and get all stupid preachy. like they did with the episode with Summer and and sex doll.
I absolutely hate that they are shoehorning in emotional plots and character development for Rick. What's always been funny about Rick is that he doesn't give a shit, he's jaded and aloof, self-centered and irredeemable. 

I don't want to see episodes about him being depressed over an ex-girlfriend. I don't want to see him sappily loving his family (except Morty every once in a very long while). I don't want Rick's catchphrase to turn out to be a cry for help because he's depressed. I don't want Rick to have best friends that he cares about, and I definitely don't want to see him get emotional when they die.

Come on. Rick is funny when he's an asshole. If they keep making him emotional and relatable and tragic, instead of just being a hilarious asshole, they're going to ruin the whole point of this show.
Freaking awesome, two of my favourite things!
My great grandma collected art like this- this painting reminds me of her. I wonder if she had any proto-Bird Person paintings. 
These Rich and Morto things are getting to the point where I will feel let down if they don't make a cameo in season 3. /u/justinroiland that's your queue!
No love for American Netflix?  I did a quick search and I can't find Rick & Morty there either.
I've said it a million times but Canadian Netflix sucks!

I'd love some Always Sunny...

Have you considered following the instructions and making one yourself? The only hard part is finding enough shleem, most of it is already in use and they don't make a lot of it anymore.
Thinkgeek apparently makes an "official" one.

Don't even get me started on trying to find a schlami, those guys are flakey as fuck
Do NOT buy Etsy ones. You could make one yourself, just make sure that you pick the right fleeb.
That's a Rob Israel piece isn't it?! God damn that looks amazing on a flag.

Awesome flag!

Ricks eyes are creepy. Trypy, even.
Definitely six seasons and a movie.
None, they even said theyre starting writing for season 4, and its probably going to continue until around season 6 (?) maybe idk. Also maybe a movie.

Though when its going to come out is a different question
100 years Rick and Morty

Total Rickfall

That's my favorite episode 
OH SHIT EVERYTHING'S ON A COB
'Ricksy Business' minus most of the Titanic storyline. It mixes human stuff with off world stuff, and it introduces such great characters like Abradolf Lincler, Birdperson, Squanchy. The scene where the dude runs out and gets eaten caught me so off guard the first time.
The episode where the family are infected with memory parasites (forgot the name of the episode.)
Something Ricked is probably my personal favorite. I love the interactions between Rick and the Devil. Either that or Morty-Night Run, because K-Michael is the best character in the show 
Get shwifty

Now this is shitposting.
Boooooo! Disqualified!
The description says it should be airing this month! 
Jesus. My head hurts.. I don't know :/ saw this was your first post and felt bad that there was no comments so just came to say hi. 
I would assume that the Council of Ricks is capable of tracking Ricks across dimensions. Rick even states in the episode that you need more than one Morty to shield yourself from other Ricks. That and the fact that he didn't protest the identification of the council makes it pretty clear that he is indeed Rick C-137.

BUT that does not mean that our Morty is from the C-137 universe. Because there are strong indicators that our Morty is not Ricks original Morty (i.e. the footage of baby-Morty when evil Rick downloads his memories). So, imo, our Morty isn't C-137 Morty. If I had to guess, I'd say Evil Morty is from C-137.
I believe Rick is from c-137. Yet everyone else is not. When Rick checks Jerry to daycare, he puts N/A for Jerry's dimension. And Rick has memories of baby Morty. I assume from his original dimension. so Morty is from a different dimension from Rick. And everyone else is from a different dimension from Rick and Morty. I think the reason they call him Rick c-137 is because that's where he's from. Not where he resides.

Or I'm over thinking it
My apologies for the mistake, I absentmimdedly said 136. It doesn't change the nature of the question, really, so I'm rather enjoying the input. I'm a geek with Aspergers Syndrome, so this kind of discussion is fun for me. :)
The best part about this show is the fact that every episode could take place in a different parallel universe with a different Rick and Morty, and we would have absolutely no idea.

This was great. I wish there were more Rick and Morty references. Like instead of those guys got eaten. 
"my dad was jus-just eaten by a pack of zombies"

Who cares Morty. It's just Jer-ry! The important thing is we got the Fleeb!
the rick voice kills this for me 

Ghost in a Jar!
I don't get it, and I don't need to. 
nor on my clock
Oh great. Just fucking great. Ours is the dumbass dimension with Rich and Morto instead of Rick and Morty. Fucking great. 
I feel like they're just fucking with us now.
I see them making an episode following Rich and Morto in Season 4. 
And now the meme will live. 


Tuck Fammy
That was quick : /
rich and mort dot gov?

http://www.richandmort.gov/  doesn't exist :(
Confirmed: Two hundred more years of Rick and Morty!
The wait is to much for some people. Some have begun to lose their minds.
Did they purposely put Morty's name in the anti-Semitic "((( )))"?
/r/richandmorto
I think we did it... We broke Don Herman.
(((Morty)))
I saw this and flipped the fuck out
Seems to be based on [https://twitter.com/therealcliffyb/status/798711959088754688](http://i.imgur.com/fSuUh1M.png)
Can't wait for the official knock-off t-shirts.
Oh geez! Uh, Rick, you- you're really not yourself when you're hungry! M-maybe you should eat a Snickers!
This is what happens when you buy the cheapest RAM.
Why does Morty have the (((Jewish))) meme brackets around him?

How does this affect the lore?
The Rick/Earl of Lemongrab morph I've spent my whole life waiting for!
I swear to god if Rich and Morto shows up in season 3...
What if season three airs, and it's actually an entirely new show called Rich and Morto? 
Season 3 is actually just whole new show, now called Rich and Morto,  since Rick is in jail 
Rich and Morto sound more like the suave and sophisticated alternatives to Rick & Morty to me. Like instead of a twisted Doc & Marty they're a European Doc & Marty or something. 
Oh my god, we have created a monster.

Time to got Schwofty
If we keep the meme alive long enough for season 4 they'll make an episode!
This confirms my long-held theory that our show was the alternate-world version of the Rich and Morto show. 
See when Rick Sanchez is locked up for "everything" that is the end of Rick and Morty. 
Now we pick up with season 1 of the REAL cartoon, Rich and Morto. 

The two seasons we got were the troll, not Rich and Morto. 
Omg they put morty in the ((())) which I just found out is a neo nazi alt right thing lmao
jesus. the new season cant come soon enough...
That tweet will be in an episode. 


Calling it now.
wasnt that a post on reddit yesterday? 
Keep Autumn safe
I swear to god, if they change the name of the show to "Rich and Morto"...

Even the show officials has nothing better to do than love the between season shitposts. 
We did it reddit.

I guess this is officially a meme huh
That twitter post is a pile of shit and I can prove it mathematically.
I think we've gone full retard. 
Hankerin' for oranges?

It's from another version of Rick and Morty from another universe.
Someone posted a screen shot of an update on Twitter with the person saying that. Totally butchering the show

Uh oh.  It's contagious.
Well then get your shit together. Get it all together, and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together. And if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere. You know? Take it to the shit store and sell it. Or put it in a shit museum, I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together.
Get your shit together, Rich and Morto.

What if this is like a teaser for season 3? What if Rich and Morto are an alternate universe versioning Rick and Morty (cuz infinite universes, infinite possibilities right?) and they have to team up to save rick or something. Y'all think they're messing with you, when they're really trying to help you guys. 
IT'S ALIVE!!
it broke
I'm submitting this to r/hailcorporate.




Lol so meta. Best show on television right now.
That's just dimension ㄥƐƖƆ
Do they really think we're as stupid as Jerry? Obviously they're only using 5% of the maximum processing power in our area of the simulation.
Is this what this sub has become? We've been quoting so much Rick and Morty that everything has started to break down? The quotes don't even make sense anymore!
Why does this surprise *anyone*? Justin Roiland is a mod here. /u/justinroiland

AS: Please don't call this number ever again.

What do you guys think about it meaning ricks immortal?
they are referring to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/therealcliffyb/status/798711959088754688) 
rick is going to say woobalooba dick duck now

My friend an I come up with this stuff on a daily basis, this is nothing new for me.
Wait is Morty Jewish?
>Rick and (((Morty)))

I laughed.
Turns out it all comes from this tweet: https://twitter.com/therealcliffyb/status/798711959088754688
jesus christ morty its *belch* its.. its like like they think they're in the better dimension or something
If Rich and Morto is a bit during season 3 I'm going to shit a brick
Wait... why does Morty have the antisemitic parentheses?
I really hope they work this into a future episode. 
So Rich would have to be a druggie that farts alot when he talks right..? 
I dont even like this meme
Sounds like they've been renewed for another season which now makes 4.

Also Jerry giving birth hasn't happened yet. I do find it interesting that Mr. Beauregard was in the credits before the parasite episode, and he remained afterward but Mr. Poopybutthole didn't. 
You have to watch the episode in reverse. 
There are a few scenes in the openings that have yet to be in episodes, another example is the mole looking things drilling into the kitchen. 
Did you get any of that?

Man we *burp* really need a new season.
What is this, a crossover episode?
Rick v bojack drinking contest. 
Man I can't think of a better show to crossover with Rick and Morty than Bojack Horseman
Holy shit.  Jerry and Mr.  Peanutbutter would have the *funniest* conversation of all time. Jerry woukd feel so good about himself,  he's fucking hilarious when he feels good about himself. 
Throw some Archer in there as well, he also has the nihilistic view of life. He even said at one point he was sure he physically *couldn't* die, which I think fits very well with what Rick is thinking given the endless amount of universes.
It would be revealed, that Erika is a Gazorpazorp
That would be epic
I feel like Rick would NOT get along with Bojack. I think he would rip Bojack a new one and it would be glorious
Love u
Fuck Bojack, that show is like the guests on Space Ghost, they're trying to be funny without realizing they are the joke.

They need to add this as a random alternate universe Rick and Morty. Just have them walk by in the background of the Jerry daycare, or something. Maybe a cameo in the council of Ricks.

Do you want a massive tip? Because this is how you get a massive tip. 
Yep working in a restaurant will cause the Wubba Lubba Dub Dubs. I did it for 2 years.
Peace among worlds!
Nachos and Titos Vodka sounds amazing.
Does anyone else read "wooba" and "looba" when there isn't a double-b after the u?
That sounds like one of those made-up places from the show:

"We're going to the Guanabanas nebula for some [BLEEP] NACHOS, bitches!"
the fact that it's giving you the finger makes me think this belongs in /r/thathappened . he couldn't do this on his job

I bet they handed you back the same 20 you tried to tip with that you then left on the table.
So is she single?
Nice try, Guanabana's social media marketer.
Hi, I'm a manager at guanabanas, please let us know the location of the store and your server's name. We will make sure this individual is properly disciplined. Thank you for your cooperation.

Oh, for fuck's sake! Where is season 3?!?! Where?!?!

I don't get it. Where is this character design from?
I am in great pleasure, don't help me.

Oh, and what makes you think Unity is one of those filthy cone-nipple bastards?!?! 
Nice concept and execution! Love the juxtaposition of basically everything with lil happy Rick up there.
someone shot Unity in the back though!  MEDIC!  :D
Love it! 
This is great! Reminds me of one of my favorite artists, Jim Mahfood.
Is this like the Chinese bootleg Rick and Morty?
[deleted]
I can't help but think that this version of Rick sneezes instead of burping... and perhaps he's addicted to cough syrup and has a set or armor made of Kleenexes.
I'm Mr. Youseeks!!  Look at yourself!!
No regrets 
Ohmygod
That final scene from S01's pilot still gets me every time.

PRESENT TO ME WHAT YOU POSSESS
This is probably the best post we've had in months, I guess. 
This sounds like something that would appear in an inter dimensional cable episode; where this would be an in-universe parody of Rick and Morty.
Morto has a dad, Gary, and a sister, Autumn.  

They go to a planet with a crying moon.  

There is a floppy-mouth alien professional who like to go jillin' again...

I really don't understand her intentions... Either:

A. She actually likes the show and is an idiot.

B. She hates the show and is mocking it.

C. She knows that r/rickandmorty is filled with grade-A shit posters and is looking for some internet fame.

Regardless, wooba looba dick duck. I am in great pain, and need some answers.

Flu hatin rapper y'all!!!!
Best cosplay so far, these people and that bird-person-girl that couldn't look apathetic or make her abs look tubby.
The Morties are always the best.
the ex what
These are all fantastic, but props to the Rick for looking super fucking Rick.
I always think chance is saying "fall like rick and morty" in blessings 
Brick + Mortar is actually a band as well, and on tour they had Rick & Morty themed t-shirts. 
There's a Progressive Insurance commercial where one of the actors yells, "Brick and mortar! What?" at the end.

I rewound and rewatched that commercial 3x to make sure he wasn't saying, "Rick and Morty! What?"
I **KNEW** I wasn't the only one who has to think for a second when someone says "Brick and Mortar"
Good band actually. [Here's one of their more popular songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfrPU0Gk5r0) I actually work for a radio station and they played a show for us, they were really nice guys.
Amazing band! saw them a few months ago live, rad experience.  
Why were you googling brick and mortar?
It looks like Rick and Jerry to me. 
Nice, cool minimalist design.
Morty's eye shouldn't be slightly closed I don't think, but a great design overall
Love it. Reminds me of Daft Punk, too.
Rick and Jerry
It's good!

Just one thing, the plural of Jerry is "Jerrys" because it's someone's name. (Not "Jerries". Unless they used the text "Jerries" on the show?)

Shit, spelled Rich wrong. Sorry for the poor quality, I haven't heled a pencil in far too long 
My thought was that to rip off Rick and Morty, you can't directly rip it off. So, lets take two dudes from an 80s movie, and see where it goes. Decided to make Ted look like Neo, because I was bad at drawing him
Coming this fall....Two Rudders.
Things really got knocked into 12th gear.
I was browsing recommendations on Amazon, and came across this. I couldn't stop laughing at the absurdity of the concept.

Edit: For those who actually want to see it, You can find it on Amazon [here](https://smile.amazon.com/Apocalypse-Troll-David-Weber/dp/0671578456?sa-no-redirect=1)


*laughing* "It's just called Apocalypse Troll."
Hold on, there's more. ^^old ^^women, ^^are ^^coming
My mind definitely produced the voice from the 2 Brothers while reading this
I read this book when I was a teenager, it gets even weirder. If I remember correctly the hyper intelligent semi immortal space babe tries to murder kangaroos in a zoo because they look like the evil aliens
> It's called- [laughs] It's just called The Apocalypse Troll!
My prediction: as a result of this thread this book becomes a sleeper bestseller. Unable to understand why, the publishing world begins an undertaking of plagiarism the likes of which haven't been seen since the Hunger Games (so, not very long ago at all).

For the next 5 years or so most bookstores have an entire section dedicated to stuff that reads like it was made up as the writer went along with no editing.

The insufferable autocannibals who name every literary movement coin a name for the genre: *slipstream of consciousness*. 
Hey OP, thanks for using Amazon Smile. Just wanted to say so.
I've actually read this as a teenager. It's was a pretty fun read though there were plenty of convenient plot elements. But the title is gore. Definitely one of the more developed ideas on dimensionally time traveling immortal post humans coming back from a federation like league of spacefarers to stop a genetically engineered troll like entity created by a malevolent species of kangaroid aliens I've read.
This is *amazing*.  I thought you'd just hacked in that content, but nope.. that's actually real!  Brilliant.  I almost want to read it now.  Almost.
I'd buy that for 25 schmeckles
Is it important that we know who Richard Ashton was in order to get this?
This book is amazing, FYI
Mexican Alien Armada, also full of *GORGEOUS FEMALES.*
I see stuff like this and think, "gee, I could've been a better writer than that..."

Then I remember I prefer just lazily throwing out random, startling, single-syllable non sequiturs.
It's called...alien...ufo...carrier group...from the outer black...lifeboat mach 17...apocalypse troll....it's...it's just called apocalypse troll.
These alternate universe novels have an almost improvisational tone.
I just ate half a kilo of cheese while lying down in bed. Now I've read this. I'm going to have good dreams tonight 
God, that sounds like a [bizarro fiction book](https://bizarrocentral.com/).
Please tell me someone has actually read this
Lol what the hell I read this book just a few months ago.
What surprises me, is that it has a 4.5 star rating. 
This is almost as good as the literotica about the woman having sexual relations with dinosaurs.

Yes, it's also on Amazon.
I've read this book, I might still have it somewhere.
I wonder if this author realizes just how big 500 megatons is for a bomb.
HOLY SHIT HE FUCKED THE ALIEN
Looks like law and order font
How does this have 4.5 stars?
I want to get the edition with Foreword by Peter Chimaera
I....really want to read that. I think I may be stupid. 
Hah, that's hilarious.  I wasn't expecting to see David Weber as the author though.  I read the first eight books of the Honor Harrington series, and while they were space opera, I don't think you could write up the plot in such a wacky way.

David Weber is incredibly prolific though.  I guess there's room for everything in his bibliography.
actually a pretty good book IMHO
I read it in the narrators voice
If there are books this bad, why can't I write a book? I mean I've been writing for years. 
Wait, what? This is David "Honor Harrington" Weber? The same guy who can write a 900 page book that is 95% exposition dialogue? 
If you're looking for escapist literature this is a great book. If you want a serious hard SF novel step on to the next title.  I've read most of David Weber's catalog and liked most of it, but then I read SF with no expectation that the story coincides with any phase of reality. 
Hey its not just a screenshot from the show this is awesome. 
You just made that author rich, congratulations!
For the record, this is actually a half decent book.

You can read it online: http://baencd.freedoors.org/Books/The%20Apocalypse%20Troll/
I guess I'm ordering it while I wait for season 3
This has to be the worst book I will ever read cover to cover
It's just called to brothers 
TWO BROTHERRRS...
'megatonner'
Weber has some *amazing* hard sci fi military novels in the Honor Harrington series (and spinoffs), but everything else he does is pretty dumb. 
It has good ratings though so I am conflicted...
This is funny but I think I'm missing how it's connected to rick and morty
it's actually got really really good reviews. Like everyone who reviewed it really enjoyed it. What? If it's written like that summary....I can't even.
I'm. Dead. 
"Usually ships within one to two months". Ironically, the crushing feeling of despair when I found out the book isn't shipping anytime soon is similar to my feelings for season 3.
Well I think David Weber's works have drastically improved since then, seriously some of his other stuff is pretty good. 
I....read the book...and liked it awhile ago...
Did nobody else catch that critical typo?
There's a show on Syfy called Aftermath that is basically this show.  Every possible end of the world situation happens.  Demons, various cultural monsters, volcanoes, biblical stuff, dragons even.  It's great lol.
This might be the actual inspiration for the "2 Brothers" bit.
Ya, it really has a sort of improvisational tone. 
and that was when it began to get really interesting....three weeks earlier 
And that was when it began to get really interesting... Because, she was, a queen, of the aliens, but with bats that talk and wear cyborg appendages, in their MIND! Because they're psychic, warrior bat alien queen WARRIORS! And then came the PLAGUE, of micro robots, who can transform, into kitchen utensils, so that they can hide, from humans, who want to experiment on them, for NEFARIOUS PURPOSES! Which marked the beginning, of the TROLL APOCALYPSE, TROLL... Meanwhile, in 1985...
Live the Honorverse series of beers, I had no idea he wrote this stuff though. He needs to write the official Two Brothers novel. 
Jeezus, published JANUARY 1 2000, and titled *apocalypse* troll.  I wonder who he was making fun of.

> "The next ten chapters deal with letting the world know about the troll without the troll knowing they know. Plans to destroy the troll are made while waiting for the troll to reveal itself."

AHhahhahahahaaaaa, that's a perfect description of what doomsday conspiracy theorists spend their lives doing.

I *gotta* get this book for a friend.

> http://fora.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?t=67589

Jeezus, is this "hidden in plain sight" so well that nobody realizes?  I can't find any references anywhere to this book being a hoax or a big joke.

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_Dark_(Weber_novel)

> "Master Sergeant Stephen Buchevsky: A U.S. Marine initially stationed in Afghanistan, also a Vampire later in the book."

:|  :\  Jeeze, maybe Weber found it's actually profitable to write bongo stories and insert a little hoo-ha here and there.
Sweet Christ almighty I'm gonna buy this
Female alien warrior rescue after nuking the Navy fleet in the Atlantic with a 50 megatonner. The movie
This is like a less offensive Shawn Wunjo novel.
It also sounds like it could have been written by the Lighthouse Keeper from The Purge episode.
This guy... he just keeps getting published.  And that's when he sits down and writes... ANOTHER piece of shit... but wait, thats when the puppies invade!!
The folks at r/pieceofshitbookclub would love this I'm sure. 
Either this guy can't form proper sentences, or he 's such a Rick and Morty fan he wrote a whole book inspired by it. I pray it's the second one.
what...what is two brothers...?
"Is he keeping his shoulders square?" "Oooooooh he's tryin'!"
*Game.*

If Meeseeks could get two strokes off Jerry's golf *swing*, he'd subtract a stroke with every swing, and come in like 200 under par.

A. This is a great activity and we definitely need something to limit the shitposts. In general, this is the type of show one can discuss each episode at length so this is a great way to do that. B. I'm curious to hear from other fans what episodes need to be added to this face-off list. Great job!
That's a pretty good idea. I will talk with the other mods about it.

edit: [done](https://redd.it/5dbpmy)
My picks:

1: Meeseeks and Destroy

2: Anatomy Park

3: Rick Potion #9

4: Ricksy Business

5: Lawnmower Dog
1. Meeseeks and Destroy. "What about your short game?"

2. Rixty Minutes, definitely. The whole episode was great!

3. This one is a pretty tough choice... Potion #9 will probably win this because of the ending alone, but I pick Raising Gazorpazorp. I enjoyed Rick and Summer's adventure.

4. Something Ricked This Way Comes.

5. Lawnmower Dog. Imo this is really good for the first episode (not counting pilot).
1. Pilot
2. Rixty Minutes
3. Rick Potion #9
4. Ricksy Business
5. M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
Wooo!

1. Meseeks and Destroy
2. Rixty Minutes
3. Rick Potion #9
4. Ricksy Business
5. M. Night Shaym-Aliens!
I feel that shitposts are all part of a rick-full universe.

Now this could go for actuall money .. Just saying :)
This is actually amazing
So are you saying that the person leading the paint had you all make this?? Did everyone know it was Rick and Morty?
Am i seeing rick and morty where i shouldn't  now?
This is really neat! Thanks for sharing.
I feel like having the screaming sun this would have been so perfect!

Aaaaand here's a dude wearing it. http://i.imgur.com/OeXeKi6.jpg
Can I pay for it with my soul? I'm a little low on human currencies. 
Well there's $50 I didn't expect to spend today. Now to plot on how to get family pictures in it.
How much is this in Schmeckles?
Nice. It's knitted and not a dumpy sweatshirt marketed as a sweater. 
I bought one instantly. 
/r/shutupandtakemymoney 
Jesus Christ, our Savior, was born this day!
Is this knit or printed on a sweater? The description says knit, but the sweater looks printed
Just placed my order. Can't wait to ruin some holiday photos!
Must have, it's so Schwifty.
is there a sizing chart? I am a larger fellow, and i can never get the height to shoulder ratio i like.

Damn, hope I didnt order too small then.
As a Candian, I am deeply upset I will not be able to rock this sweater this holiday.
My sweater just arrived today and I love it! It's way softer than I was expecting, and I can't wait to wear it at family gatherings and at other inappropriate times! Thank you!! 
> 60% Cotton 40% Acrylic

I have only bad experiences with Acrylic fabrics. Avoid avoid.
Did you get this from AliExpress by any chance? I've seen it on there but had reservations about the quality.
What size did you get and how does it fit?
That "Do it, motherfucker, pull the trigger" moment is still the one that makes me wince the hardest in the series. He's not calling Morty's bluff. He's not putting on a show. Rick is legitimately ready to die, right there, if that's what's going to happen.

It's easy to focus on Rick being goofy, or drunk, or even sad, but it's *those* moments that really reveal just what a hardcore motherfucker the old man is.
*What are you in for?*

Everything.

I prefer what Summer says before this about the universe being pointless.
I just squanch this so much!
Just like in a normal vehicle starting takes the most juice. 
The Ship AI is probably controlled by the technology thingie, not the car thingie.
I would imagine that would run on its own source of power, in the event Rick crashes or the battery breaks and he requires information on where ever he is.
If it's like back to the future, Mr fusion powers the computer and space circuits, but the engine and lights run on a not so ordinary car battery, it always has. 
it was probably the quantum carburetor 
No jumping in the sewer.

^(**|** *`Don't be Rickdiculous. I do more than pass butter`*)

Backup source of power.  Hell, Rick probably could have powered the ship with the backup but didn't see any reason not to just fix it there.
All that it takes is a fully charged battery to keep summer safe!

[Meanwhile, in the Trump camp...](http://i.imgur.com/uWj75xi.png)
I like the theory that evil Morty is the Morty that Rick leaves behind in the intro. 
We all just pass butter. 
K micheals was my second favourite charatcer behind the meeseeks so I really like all the theories involving him, he's been shown to break into rvery high security places before and I don't care that he's dead I just want him back.
It's not arriving in less than a month?

Gasp. I am shocked at this news.

*Shocked*, I say.
Oh my God, that's perfect.
What terrifies me is the fact that I'm in college algebra now as well, and I don't know what any of that stuff is. *presses button*
What suprise me is that the teacher knew what rick & morty was.
Ah jeez Rick, where'd my hand go??
Here is the link to the album: http://imgur.com/a/856Zk

These shoes are hand painted by me with Acrylic paint, drawn first in pencil and then outlined with a fine-tip black marker. They are coated with Polyurethane to lock in the paint and to protect it from weathering, mud, cracks, and chips in the paint. 
Niice 
If I owned these, I would never wear them. I'd just keep them on my shelf and dust them regularly to keep em clean.
This is awesome. You really had to concentrate on there hands i bet.
These look like shit

No. Do not associate this show with that tumour of a song. 
Am I gonna have to block this too? Come on guys.
A little off topic, but this is one of my favorite songs, and so I felt the need to post my favorite version featuring Michael Jackson: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkCn-iWLiSE

Both this show and that song helped me get over some bad times, and seeing the show and song referenced together in an albeit shitty 4-panel brought back some nostalgia.

Yup, this show is confirmed to have the world's most annoying and cringe-worthy fanbase
I’ve never watched Rick and Morty, but it did seem interesting, so I was going to get into it, but… now I’ve changed my mind.
I enjoyed this. Fuck the haters.
My man....
Great shit poast 
wtf is that top right panel?
Lame! I thought we were up all night to get riggity riggity wrecked son!! 
I get it. Show me what you got.
I love this show and I love this sub but it's sad to see so many people get so worked up over such a silly meme 
GOOD shitpost 
can someone cut the audio to make this song?
how do i upvote the flair lmao
This show and its fanbase is absolute cancer
Ahhh fuck you guys. It wasn't that bad, i got a good chuckle from it. 
At least the political shitposts were relevant. 
This was so fucking funny! Cringe or not I liked it. Maybe it's the cringe that made me like it so much
I'm just imagining butterbot doing the bridge.
5 more minuets of this and i'm gunna get mad.  Not my fault this is happening. 
I think this is funny.
😂😂😂I laughed so hard. Good post man. Only good quality meme I've seen on sub

TIL about this subreddit.

I subscribed.
NOICE!
When did the second panel happen? I may have to rewatch Rick and Morty again
Can't say I've never been there? 
Doc I'm tripping my face off
At a night festival once and decided to drop two tabs. A friend asked me for a tab so I tore one off for him. He looked at it and told me I'd given him two instead of just one. I looked at the sheet and realised it was doubled over add that I'd just taken 4 trips. It was an interesting night. My friends still talk about my antics.
There's always that really uncomfortable feeling during the come up. It goes away once I peak but the come up is always the least enjoyable part of dropping acid for me.
I agree
Thought that was Randal from Recess for a second
What is that even supposed to mean?
Two tabs really isn't shit.
So when that happened start at Mortynight Run and watch the rest of season 2. You will laugh, cry and wish you didn't understand how meaningless it all was. I highly recommend it, I try to take acid 3 times a year at the minimum.
I have rewatched both seasons about 3 times, send help 
Maybe The Grandma's Virginity podcast is for you! Hosted by Justin Roiland (who voices Rick and Morty and a million other characters), Ryan Ridley and Jackie Buscarino who also do voice work on the show and many other shows. They often improvise crazy characters with voices. It's basically the interdimensional cable episode all the time.
Hell, I've gotten to the point where I speak in their voices at least twice a day. 
Geez, Rick. I-I don't think it was the popularity of the post that people didn't like, you know? I-It was more about the quality?
I down voted it...
/r/justunsubbed
People whose tastes differ from the mainstream tend to think that whatever they like is superior, because the majority of people is dumb (which, in a simplified way, isnt exactly wrong). However they fall for a flawed logic by automatically assuming that everyone who goes against the mainstream is less dumb. When actually, the simple fact that you feel the need of expressing your superiority (which is done to distance yourself from what you call dumb) makes it less likely you are not dumb, but just insecure about your intelligence. 
that it airs before the cancer takes me
At this point, all I want is season 3. Period.
Free Rick.
The first episode must be a prison break they've said it we all want it. It's gonna happen. We want bird person and k Michael back in the fold and we want to know more about Rick's past. We wanna see some intergalactic space war shit son. Shit on the floor.
The 1:st episode has to be a prison break
I expect the animation to be better in general. I expect more crazy characters and situations. I expect Rick to be an even bigger ass. I expect the new season to evolve and uncover some more answers to our questions.
What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it.
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A DAMN PRISON BREAK!!! He volunteered himself! And those articles that say the creators have said they will be are weasel word mashups of fan theories and ambiguous claims from the creators - they HAVE said Rick won't be in prison for long 'because it's a show about the universe, not being in prison' or words to that affect. They haven't mentioned anything about how.
You need to make this a poster, like now.

I'm not a big fan of combined references, but this one is pretty decent. 
I could totally see this happeninf
I feel like watching an episode of Rick and Morty is almost like watching a D&D quest: the 'quest' is outlined at the start and then a bunch of dice are rolled and shit gets crazy!    
  
P.S. completely ignored your question... sorry!
Yup it just starts like that, and no they will never go back to find their real family after the incident, I don't believe that family is even ricks "real" family. He says at one point that it wasn't the first time he has done that.
take your time watching season 2, trust me
Actually not bad!
We need more of this and less shitposting, pictures of tiny food and "i drew myself in the style of rick and morty"
Maybe try and level out your mix a bit and clean up your distortion overtones to clean up the melody, but pretty good none the less
We would have to know the pseudo-science behind how FTL travel works in the Rick & Morty multiverse. I think it's more likely that it's the ships doing something weird than TV signals taking the long way. 

That's awesome! Very well done!
/r/mechanicalkeyboards would have a massive erection over these colors. 
Thats how most people talk when they're just casually speaking, but we're not used to it from a president. Trump desperately needs a speech coach to help him. He's the worst-spoken President in awhile in that respect. 
I've always imagined Trump as Rick. [Here's a narration for those wondering what that might sound like.](https://clyp.it/1bhmyq2w)
You have a whole city sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery!

Very cool sweater! Great job. I'd buy one 
Every new thing I learn about Iceland just confirms that it's the best country ever.

From an alternate dimension where all traditional folk art sweater patterns are Rick's face. Nothing special to see here.
Geggjuð!
Where did you buy that seriously? Im trying to find it online. I want one. I need one. 
Great job! Looks like you could make some serious shmeckles if you wanted to create more and sell them online.

"Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry, but life is made of little concessions."

"Fart-saving, carpet-store motherfucker".

  "I created the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries!"




"You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves. Don't be sheep."
Morty: “I just killed my family! I don’t care who they were!”

Rick: “I dunno, some people would pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough.”
"Wait, that's what you use my universe for? TO RUN YOUR CAR?"

Not rick, but that whole scene is great
The episode you saw in the add was Season 1, Episode 2: Lawnmower Dog.
so the good news for you is that you can watch that episode now and it will be -like- new.
http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Lawnmower_Dog

Original air date: December 9th, 2013

You must've saw an old promo for that episode.
bitch....
That's probably a reference to the Steven King [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needful_Things)...
It's funny that most of these shops named Needful Things are a reference to the same thing the R&M episode is referencing, but since there's been like 24 years since the book came out there's a new wave of people going, "Hey, you named it the thing!" that's going over their heads. Also "Something Ricked This Way Comes" is a reference to a Bradbury book. Anyway, [8].

actually recently met a girl who also loves rick and morty. we have a rick and morty date this saturday.. wish me luck guys.
I've seen this multiple times now, what is the image from? It reminds me of Aeon Flux.
Where da ant's at tho
*I...love...Morty.*

*And I hope Morty loves me.*
Does anyone know the reason behind the eyes looking like that on the show?

I was totally expecting this to be a "Ants In My Eyes Johnson" reference. This'll do.

If a girl started quoting le rick and le morty to me, I'm not going to be interested in her in the first place. Whatever the girl equivalent of a neckbeard is, that's what she is.
Everyone knew that.
Lol you normie.  Did that Elliot Smith reference fly over your head on the Tiny Rick episode too?
It's a joke using contrast as humor. He's supposed to be this dark, professional killer but then the writers catch you off-guard because he's all friendly and neighborly-like, talks about killing like candy and puppies. To top it all he gives a card with his exact coordinates in space at all times. That and it could also be a joke about how bad-ass he is. He's obviously an illegal assassin in the Galactic Federation (he kills gromphlomites at an official Galactic top-secret prison), but yet he gives away his coordinates at all time just willy-nilly which ironically got him killed. Complete opposite of what you'd expect a galactic assassin to be, which is why we love him so much.
If you ever need to rondezvous with him to trade Flurbos for weapons, you'll know where he is
I think that's part of the joke, just how non-nonchalant it all is. Plus, Rick mentions that Morty has a "very planetary mindset" implying that in parts of the universe, assassination services are perfectly legal and/or accepted.
Rick and Morty is already kind of a parody of Back to the Future 
Oh boy here I go killin again.
Awesome! Lovely work man!

Great work OP! I might put this on my next batch of business cards.
I would love to get this tattooed on me
I legit miss him even from one episode
the simulation that crashed while they were rapping was a smaller part of a larger simulation, the smaller simulation crashed, instead of the larger.

It's kind of like a virtual machine, a computer can be programmed to have a smaller, simulated, computer running inside of it, that smaller computer has fewer resources because it's technically only a program, simulating a computer, if it crashes, the whole machine doesn't crash, just the virtual one.

the simulation that froze was the simulation being generated by the simulation, so the smaller, less powerful "fake" computer froze, but not the larger one running it, if that makes sense
The directions they were rapping were directed at the audience. Rick was not asking simuMorty to do any of those things, and simuMorty wouldn't have a reason to do them anyway, since he was not programmed to directly and blindly look for the recipe without thinking of long term strategy, like the generic NPCs were.
I think simuMorty had more processing power dedicated to him. Also the simulation *inside*the simulation crashed, but the simulation simuMorty was in did not. 
I checked out the [schedule](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/schedule/), and it's just a rebroadcast of season 1 episode 2, Lawnmower dog.

Thats amazing. Who did it? It's a awesome work.
Raising Gazorpazorp is my least favourite. I mean, it has its moments, but I don't like it because of the whole Morty Jr thing, and the fact that Morty Jr releases that book titled "My horrible father." despite things being resolved. I just find that to be cringey, for lack of a better term.


I didn't really care for the second interdimensional tv episode too much. Which is weird, because Rixty Minutes is my favorite overall. I feel like they struck gold but couldn't recreate it. The improv just... wasn't as good as it was the first time. There were some good jokes here and there but it was just... less fun the second time around.
The answer is don't think about it.

Auto Erotic Assimilation. Not a very funny episode outside of the race war scene and the ending is horribly depressing. I know it's supposed to be and I appreciate that, but it's hard to look at upon multiple viewings.
I personally don't like the tiny rick episode. That's also the episode when Beth and Jerry go to intergalactic couples therapy (that storyline ends so stupid). It's the only episode that I almost don't laugh at all. 
the interdimensional cable episodes and the meseeks episode, i dont know why they're just annoying to me especially the former. (it could be because i watched the show three times and i got bored) 
Agreed on the Get Schwifty episode.  Which is strange considering how it's apparently the battle cry of fans everywhere (shirts, tattoos, random comments...).

I can't tell if it's just something that's easy to latch onto or if people really found that episode amazing.  I actually enjoyed all the "on planet" stuff with Principal Vagina much more than anything Rick and Morty were doing.
I'm really not a fan of the Raising Gazorpazorp. feels rushed and I didn't like the ending.
I'd say the pilot because it relies too much on shock humour, but it IS a pilot after all

Apart from that, I wasn't a huge fan of the penis heart storyline in IDTV 2, but the TV segments were great

Also I don't really like the storyline with Rick and Summer in Raising Gazorpazorp, but I do like Morty and Morty Jr
Meseeks and Destroy. Meseeks just aren't funny. The joke behind them - that they're born with a purpose and therefore want to complete it and die - is clever, but the execution was... well, not what I've come to expect of such a high quality show.

Also, I'm never even gonna watch Raising Gazorpazorp ever again. While Meseeks was simply *fine*, this was pure cringe start to finish. It reads like something off /r/redpill and unbelievably succeeds in being sexist to both sexes simultaneously.
Rick.

He could simply throw a portal right in front of Tony and send him to a dimension where an omnipotent being could beat him.
Throw Tony in the bargaining dimension.

You know he eats his own shit, right ?
Evil Morty is already available in Canada :D

Here's my take. The EyeHoleMan is a cocky motherfucker, challenging people to try and take his EyeHoles from him. If you win, you get delicious eyeholes, but you better bet that EHM is coming to riggity-rek your ass
This was for a college class, we had to choose 1 of 3 star wars vehicles and personalize it for a cartoon character.

I dig it.  My suggestion would be to not use a transparent black (or grey) in the shadow areas.  Use a darker hue of the same color.  I'd take the shadows out of all of it, to be honest.  Well done!

Ooooweee! A year and a half is 547 1/2 days, so we're still within schedule! This little poppypants really wishes they'd hurry up though
I don't think Mr poopy butt hole was lying when he said a year and a half man
I just finished season 2 .
what a show !
It almost feels like it's been a year and a half... or longer...
I'd honestly pay good money just to see an interdimensional cable styled series with rick and morty commentary to fill the void the lack of s3 left into me
Nothing means anything.... Except Season 3 of Rick & Morty.
I can't take it anymore, I just wanna die!
DISQUALIFIED
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
And the significance of that....is?
Take this with a grain of salt, but I went to see Joel Michal on his book tour yesterday and he was talking about how he is guest starring in an episode of Rick and Morty season 3. He mentioned that he believes that it should be coming out in January or February, so I would assume that in the next couple of months it should be here

Just realised I have never seen cloud atlas. I must watch it... just make more comical sense of that joke!
Beths mom is miss frizzle from the magic school bus.. For the school bus is real and we all know that Rick has the ability to turn morty into a car, which in uncannily similar to the magic school bus. Another evidence is that Rick is onto red heads from the unity episode, summer is a redhead which is due to the recessive gene in her grandmother who is ms. Frizzle 
There are *"an endless amount of possibilities in an infinite number of universes"*. She's alive in at least one of them, they just haven't shown it. 

Rick is running from Beth's mom? Discuss.




EDIT: Punctuation
I don't think it's ever mentioned if she's alive or not just that her and Rick split up. 
Dan Harmon has said she was an unremarkable woman whom Beth blames for Rick leaving. In the Pilot Rick mentions that he wishes she was there to eat Beth's eggs hinting that she's dead. In Rick Potion #9, however, he talks about how love slowly fades to Morty, mentioning that he went through it and his parents are going through it. That's all we know so far.

I think unity is going to be heavily involved 
Krombopulus boi!
I think the first episode will be just your average one with Rick already out and he'll just explain it like "ya, I got out quite easily".
Why does everyone think he'll break out??? He volunteered himself!! Plus the feds are on earth now and can just take his family hostage again! This annoys me so much! He's much more likely to cut a deal!

edit: care to comment rather than downvote? I honestly don't get the 'how will he break out' thing!
I dont have any bad memories of this guy.
Alternately Rick overloaded his portal gun to create a flash bang and Tammy took the whole thing to the face.
I feel like this would be a cop out, too much build up and emotional investment in these events for it to be bandaged in a manner such as this.  Even with all the sci-fi possibilities available, some things should be played straight.
If someone gets the How Its Made guy to voice that whole thing while playing that theme music in the background my life would be complete.

That's how teenage angst works. Angsty teens tend to write songs and poems to convey their angst.

By him singing songs, that allowed the real Rick to convey his message.

More shitposting from the 14 year old fan base. Cool. Hey, OP...if you're over 14 you should be absolutely embarrassed. Because you're a piece of shit since this isn't even the actual catchphrase, you stupid asshat.
he also said "or longer" 
I think we see this event happen in the first episode of the first season. Rick drags Morty out of bed, tells him he's going to reboot the Earth, and then passes out drunk.

Morty leaves with the ship (he says earlier that that Morty already knows how to drive) and begins a mission to destroy "our" Rick. Rick wakes up long enough to portals out then searches for a new family to join, and slides on in.

Yea this got my dad hooked 
Yeah, this is the exact same scene that hooked me man :)
What hooked me was the line "taut, yet malleable."
Same here.  It's also how I hooked my brother and my wife on the show. I can't wait for season 3 to release.
The part the got me properly hooked was the post credit gag after the episode with the human body theme park - literally Rick's line about the Pirates of the Pancreas becoming a monument to compromise
This for sure was my first laugh out loud moment of the show.
Oh the irony!
Is this like Marty and doc ?
I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT ! GOOD JOB ! 
Wat is Rick and morty
Birdperson approves of this.
Yes, the number of potential alternate realities would correspond to the combinations of possibilities, which are so large they can be approximated as infinite, but are still technically finite even if we do not have a number large enough to express it.  There aren't infinite possibilities, there are just a LOT of possibilities.
I'm pretty sure this is explicit canon, when the Council of Ricks talks about the central finite curve... which is the worlds where there's usually a Rick and usually a Morty.
I don't think an alternative really is possible in the show. Rick obviously said there's an infinite number of realities in that Cronenberg episode, and the Council of Ricks mention a "central finite curve".

So there would be an infinite amount of Universe with, for example, one possibility played out. Like there is an infinite number of Universes identical to the C-137 Universe. But bear with me.

I like to think the realities of the Rick and Morty Multiverse are just planes in a 4th dimensional Universe (the Multiverse), with each reality having 3 dimensional matter which is confined within that reality. 

If we have 4 spacial dimensions in this Multiverse, this means that the Universes are in fact separated by a finite distance in the 4th dimension, for example 1 meter. One Universe plays out one way, and the one which is 1 meter away plays out a completely different way. They don't have to be similar at all, let's say the process is random. So then, what are the chances that two identical Universes are right next to each other? The chances are really, really low if the configuration of position of atoms is random in each Universe. Let's say, the next identical Universe would hypothetically be 10^25 meters away in the fourth dimension. What if the range of Rick's portal gun is limited? What if the portal could only produce a tunnel in the 4th dimension that is 10^10 meters long? What if finding the next identical Universe is a very resource-heavy task because, like you said, those are some pretty big numbers for a computer? What if making a larger tunnel in the 4th dimension would require more power? That would explain why they only get "3-4 of those, tops".

Edit: Also this explains why Ricks portal gun runs out of charge sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't. If he makes a few 4th dimensional 1 meter jumps, then he will probably have enough charge left. If he hops great distances in the 4th dimension, like when he went to that future dimension in episode 1 (maybe it was far away), he would run out of charge.

Also, straying away, but what if time is still relative even across these Universes? It would explain why Rick was able to have a "lot of fun with a lot of young ladies" while Morty was only in pain for a few seconds in the pilot. The planet Morty was on was probably moving faster in space than the planet Rick was on! Rick probably knew this so he allowed himself to have fun. I think Rick doesn't do time travel, so I've read somewhere. In the background of some episodes he has a "time travel stuff" box on a shelf in his garage which indicates he will never get it off the shelf. So with time being relative across these Universes, the show can still be consistent.

Edit2: Also, note that Rick can make tunnels across all 4 dimensions in my theory. He can zip across the same Universe instantly, like when he teleported from Blitz and Chips to save Morty. So it's consistent that he makes tunnels that can "jump" a distance, whether in the x,y,z or a hypothetical 4th dimension. Also, he has some way of knowing what things are happening even though he isn't there, since he made a portal exactly where the gromphlomite was to cut him in half, exactly before he shot Morty.

Edit3: The ratio of Ricks and Mortys and Council of Ricks would be infinity divided by infinity, which is undefined in math. The physical interpretation for this would be that there would also be an infinite number of Ricks and Mortys that are NOT in the Councils.

I personally think that "Lawnmower Dog" should be 7 on this list.
auto erotic assimilation should be included in the top 3 or at least top 5!!! incredible episode
To give a real answer, go watch the wedding scene again. Rick loses his portal gun during it.
In Rick Potion 9 he gives an excuse why they can't use alternate realities as infinite do overs. I can't remember the excuse but it was clear that they couldn't Cronenberg their earth again.
The answer is don't think about it.

I'm also thinking, because he's a fugitive in his dimension, episode 'Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind' shows he can clearly become a threat across all dimensions, atleast all part of the Galactic Republic..
To all the people saying Rick lost his portal gun. That is true. However, the device that changes dimension was not the portal gun. Rick pulled the device from his car in Rick Potion 9. The device is either on planet Squanch or Earth.

I actually really love this song, both this version and the original. There's something strangely comforting about chill-as-fuck songs that describe the extinction of all carbon based lifeforms.

Stealy only has to steal one eyehole to be successful, but Eyeholeman needs to protect every single Eyehole. Stealy all the way.
My bet's on eyehole man. Stealy is only so successful because he catches people off guard. The eyehole man is constantly expecting to be stolen from.
I think the more important question is how many brapples is each eyehole worth?
Those are myyyy eyehooooles!! Get on up outta here! 
I like to imagine that the eyehole man actually manufactures/harvests the eyehole cereal just to be able to chase people down. So I think Stealy might be allowed to temporarily have eyeholes.
Stealy would just chloroform eyehole man just like he did that guy in the office. He'd probably steal the eyehole man too. 
ITT: some great fucking theories 
Fan theory: They're the same guy. 
Get up on outta here THOSE ARE MY EYEHOLES
I hope this happens 
In a fight? My vote goes to the Eyehole Man.

Stealy has a bunker which is great for hiding, but put into combat I think we need to look at the bigger picture.

Let's assume both get the entirety of their *already established* resources.

Stealy has a knife and reach to his advantage.

But Eyehole Man has either (A) a special eyehole sense or (B) a staggeringly large recon system.

Additionally he has access to helicopters with rapid deployment, and has displayed impressive grappling skills. He can hang onto a grown man's head despite objections so he gets the benefit of superior agility.

Stealy only seems to have reach. There is no evidence of strength, agility, or even superior cunning. 

So my vote goes to EHM.
Stealy is a dirty dog with chloroform, mr fantastic arms and a quite safe room. The real question is how many grapples are eyeholes worth
... is this from the post in Schwiftposting?
Well Rick seems worried that if he had Eyehole's he would be in danger but sees no threat in Stealy so I'. backing Eyehole man, even if Stealy manages to get some Eyeholes, Eyehole Man would fuck him up for it right after
Now I want a Rick and Morty: Tournament Fighter. 
This is a very interesting original question
Eyehole man would win because he is a professional ass kicker does it all the time. Stealy just takes stuff to his lair to count it up... He has no fight lol he coo tho still
Well, seeing that there was no "Mr.poopybutthole" in the episode it's most likely that we are following C-137.

Are the memes that you normally see usually very mature and intellectual? There are lame memes about captain picard, does that mean that star trek is immature?
Go away
Yeah, don't let the cringy part of the community dissuade you from watching a pretty damn good show.
The show is great, you should give it a chance before dismissing it based on the bad content you've seen the community make. 
Why should anyone try to make the show appeal to you? No one gives a shit if you watch or not.
I agree with you and Am often underwhelmed by the content on this subreddit. The show is good though 
That's just because you aren't in on it.  Watch the show and you'll be laughing your ass off.  Also, look at some of the theory discussions; not all of this is cringy content.
You shouldn't allow fanbases to influence your views of the media itself, as the worst part of them is usually the vocal majority and the most highlighted.
Eep bar dirkle someone is going to get laid in college
The answer is don't think about it. 
Because Jerry was thinking he himself was a parasite, which may lead to him being killed/dying, which would lead to the parasites possibly losing a 'host', which would result in their own deaths or the rise in the likelihood of their own deaths. 
Given Rick's statement on the parasites, I don't think they really establish relationships. They are creatures that emotionally manipulate their hosts in order to survive, hence why they had to shoot them all. I think this manipulation was used by Sleepy Gary to gain Jerry's trust (Okay, and because it was a funny scene), thus improving his chances of survival.

If you want to take it a step further, this is also why the memories they create can only be positive. In any normal relationship, there are bumps, flaws, or things that you would change about that person. You don't love someone despite their flaws, you love them with their flaws, and that's an important essence of a relationship (hell, that's how Beth and Jerry get closer at the end of tons of episodes). The parasites don't need to form a relationship like this, instead it's just based on fun and good times because that's all they need.

Haha, this is an interesting topic to think about. That episode was great because it could be as surface or as deep as you wanted.

As a new rick and morty fan what episode is this from? 
This will hold me over until season 3 wow. This was so fucking awesome! I eslecially loved the 'fuck you tree.' And if I had a nickel for every time I said that...
Because Morty is a [Jewish name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_parentheses). It's a joke from the writers.
Those are echos. Originally white supremacist groups would say Antisemitic slurs, but then they started being more covert and would put names in three parentheses to indicate the person was Jewish, like (((Bernie Sanders))). It made the Antisemitism harder to Google for, and when you said them out loud you use kind of like a stereotypical whining New York Jewish accent. 

Then, people found out. Jewish people started putting their own names in parentheses to kind of reclaim it. Then non-Jews started doing it too in support. 

I think (((Morty))) being in parentheses is maybe a joke about how his name belongs on an old Jewish man, a joke Rick makes in the show. I know before I watched the show, I thought it was about a little boy named Rick and his grandpa Morty, because it's just so terrible and unexpected a name for a young kid. 
The answer is don't think about it.

I always thought that this particular monologue was absolute genius. It's so stupid, so pointless, almost nonsense rambling from Morty at the end of a scene. Yet I was laughing my ass off and I've never been able to figure out why.

GET YOUR SHIT POLITICAL MEMES OUT OF HERE!

(Nice one OP)
Not just this sub... and it's getting annoying. 
I'm gonna need you take all your political posts and put them waaaay up your asshole. 
[deleted]
Needs more text.
W-wow, Morty, really taking a-a hard stance there, M-morty. Really sh*belch*owing everyone that you're a big-a big tough guy, Morty. You must have it real h*belch*ARD being a white-white milquetoast little weirdo with your-your nuclear family and your cul-de-s*belch*ACK with a-a dog and a f-fenced in yard. You really know what it's like being t-targeted, Morty, the-the system is out to get you, huh Morty?
> musuem
And here I thought I'd be safe here.
I read that exactly in Morty's voice. What I love is you could've put it over a picture of Rick and I totally would've read it in Rick's voice too.
Amen
You both want to be Uncle Sams favourite. 

Now listen, I know you two are very different from each other in a lot of ways.

But you have to understand, as far as Uncle Sams concerned, you both are pieces of shit!

Yeah, I can prove it mathematically!
Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. It's been a long time coming anyways.
Everytime I see something that implies Rick cares about the election (or anything else) I think to my self "that is what the inter-galatic call a planitary mindset."

Now, I do care about this election, but Rick won't. He ends worlds.
Ma man!
I posted one after the 3rd debate.

Got a few thousand upvotes, first front page ever. Felt pretty proud, but was harrassed a bit.

Then this guy posts the same thing, post title SAYS its a repost, gets *7000* karma and reddit gold.

Never had FOMO over imaginary internet points in my life.
"In bird culture this is considered a dick move"
How about no politics
Why can't we all just be shwifty? 

Member 2 years ago when /all was nothing but shitposts and had no political nonsense on there. 
* snap  fingers* YES
can't watch rick and morty and support trump. it just doesnt work
Yeah., I'm not from America, I couldn't give AF about that election & I'm not subbed to any subs that would cause me to look at the election (besides on the election night where tons of subs had threads for it) yet it's making it's way to every sub I'm subbed to.
Give it a week and everything  will be back to normal 
Complaining about politics is politics.  Just FYI.

> "What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it."
Can someone link the scene or tell me what episode this is?
Also, fuck /u/EnemyPigeon ^^TM
Wow Morty- that sure is a great political meme you just posted.
http://i.imgur.com/dvaj6zU.jpg
It's getting to the point I can't stand it. When there are like 10 subreddits hogging the front page with same political shittyness which can't be blocked in the normal app, and then the normal subreddits do it too....stop it Reddit you're such a shithole right now. 
Isn't complaining about the problem, contributing to it? Report so the mods can decide if it needs to be taken down.

What the fuck do I know though. Bitching gets free karama.
The real question is, does this meme belong in that backpack as a political meme, and if it did would there ever have been a backpack to put it in without this meme telling them to put their memes in a backpack.
Everyone is talking about the election because pretty much everyone is going to be affected by it. 
Awww, what's wrong /r/rickandmorty, is this your first race war? 
ooo la la somebody's going to get laid in college...
Including this post right? ;D
I absolutely love how everyday no fail r/all is flooded with shitposts from the Donald, and of course the mobile app doesn't let you filter it out. It's getting so annoying it makes me want to stop going on Reddit 
When you say "lately" you literally mean the past 3 days? It hasn't even been a week. It's not just political, it's pretty much the most topical thing that can happen in this country at any given time. It'll calm down dudes. 
Thank god someone on this sub (OP) figured out how to say this and not get downvoted
It's every damn sub. And 4chan. And every news channel and site. And newspapers? Are newspapers still a thing?

I really hope this dies down soon. Its just making some people more defensive and other people salty.
Boo! These Rick and Morty political memes always bring a smile to my face, and I'm in need of smiles. Badly! 

Edit: but thank you for this one. Yay!
This sub doesn't need planetary mindsets in here, Morty!
Ironically political memes is what I'd expect from this show 
You misspelled "museum ".
Can't imagine why, either.
Museum, Mr. President.
so is this meme telling us to stop posting political memes or to stop bitching about them? unclear, making new memes
Normally I'd agree, but the I thought the ones I saw on here were pretty good.
I always thought it was kind of ironic how people reference the "get your shit together" scene sincerely, because it turned out that what Summer was trying to convince Morty of before he said that tirade was ***absolutely right***.

It kinda reminds me of people sincerely using the "You have no power here!" meme from lotr
I read this in morty voice. 
Isn't this picture already a political meme? 
I could use a comma or two
> Musuem 
this is a shit political meme
[deleted]
There's a place for both the stupidly funny memes and the overtly political memes here. The show balances both heavy philosophical topics and fart jokes, after all.
Amen.  All y'all thinking rick would've gone for hillary are hilariously shortsighted.  Rick hates this entire planet.  Voting for trump would probably be an amusement to him.
The "put it in a backpack" cracks me up. Why is that so funny?
normally I'd think that's WAY too much text for one of these, but it just captures the spirit of the scene so well. Well done.
Thank you so much, someone had to say it
Does that include this meme?
This is also technically political. Enjoy your sweet, hypocrite karma, OP :P
This really showed me how genius the dialogue of Rick and Morty is
I don't give a shit about the election right now, all I want to know is WHEN?????????? Come on Harmon and Roiland, I know you're working hard but like maybe even a month or a season? This winter? Next Spring? I'm dying inside. 

This scene gets quoted a lot in my house. It's one of our favorites.
I needed this so bad!

He was wrong, remember? And she was right.
ITs not liks we are mormon or dieing.
I mean let's be real, I love Rick and Morty, but this subreddit is a bit shit. It was great a while back, but now it's 90% repost. That's how I kind of feel about this post really, it's a play on one of the 4 or 5 quotes that gets put up at least once a week and gets 4000+ up votes and it's all very boring. I think it just shows you how watered down the Rick and Morty fan base is getting, honestly. 
ha ha duud e but anyone else ricc is [my preferred political candidate] tho? 
My front page is 80% porn at this point as I have to keep unsubbing from all the vile shit out there.
OP is an /r/the_donald user, btw.  
The misspelling of musuem sealed it for me. 5/7

Thank you
Kind of weird that you were that willing to sell my existence out for some trim, Morty
Yeah, political memes are SOO much worse than 5000 identical mr meeseeks pumpkin posts.
mods please fucking do something, and the rest of you fucking idiots stop upvoting political spam! 
I'm not American, and you guys should calm down.
I mean, it's honestly not a bad thing. Shows that a lot of people are participating in the election, which makes it even more democratic. I never understood the mentality behind "dont talk about politics here", because it's bad for society as a whole. 
Thanks for saying this
Finally, someone said what needed to be said.  All praise the giant heads
thank you
Thank you!!! This and every non-political sub need to reevaluate why we are here. 
Agreed - we need to formally designate this subreddit a safe space so that we aren't triggered by political posts. I tried just not reading political posts but it's *hard*.
fuck you too buddy
What really bugs me is that reddit acts like there's only one valid political opinion to be had. And if you disagree, you're just an uninformed racist/misogynist/homophobic/transphobic/Islamophobic/whateverelsethefuck
I don't remember anyone complaining before the election when the political memes were mostly pro-Hillary...
that said, where did that "I want to be with Bernie," Jerry image go? I have been looking for it ever where since it was deleted and I can't find it anywhere else, it was brilliant
More like EVERY SUB:

Before Election: "LOL Political memes!  Our sub is about garlic bread but DAE TRUMPKINS???  rofl Trump Trump Trump, upvotes to the LEFT!!!"

After Election: "Ugh political memes, so tired, can't you just get over it, *our* sub certainly never posted those, just get over it."

Sore fuckin' losers and salty sallies.
TL;DR
Appreciate the sentiment but this is just low effort.
[Here's a fresh non-political meme, lads](http://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1429/94/1429942637883.webm)
Are you saying he's drinking...semen?
Only in the fact that television producers that get *that close* to a significant number would stretch it out a little to get to the 1000 season mark.

100 episodes is an important landmark in TV shows, and you'll see many of them commemorate it with a special episode, usually a clip show, to kind of rest on their laurels a bit.

Running for almost 1000 seasons, even if that was commonplace for Cromulons, would likely only be foregone in light of an episode that they know simply would never be topped, no matter what.

I would have it try to find me a girlfriend, the only problem is that it might become like the Meeseks and Deatroy episode and the original one would just use the box for more.
dont break this wall
I feel like Rick would just say, "so you're the creators, huh? Well fuck you"
"R-Rick! You can't just say that to our creators, ya know? Cuz they like created us and all that"
"Fuck you morty"

No offense, but I hope that isn't permanent

L'il Bits Rick?
lovely  😍
That was surprisingly good, it's a good read 
Just one Jan Michael Vincent, or all the Vincent's from all the quadrants?  
At least look up the character name if you're going to post this haha. It's ["Krombopulos Michael."](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Krombopulos_Michael). And clearly Krombopulos. Not even a question. He has a myriad of futuristic weapons like particle ray guns and crap, plus he's like the best hitman in the universe right? Jan Michael Vincents clearly get used up all the time!
Jan Michael Vincent has been trying to kill Jan Michael Vincent since the day everyone simultaneously forgot about Air Wolf. :/
JMV seemed to do pretty well in an action scenario, but K Michael took out all those gromflamites without any serious trouble. I'd say K Michael wins this one.
Then I'd have to say krombopulos michael. Though Jan Michael Vincent is a badass, he is no match for an intergalactic hit man.
I like it in general, but it commits the Ultimate Sin of Science Fiction: it uses the phrase "quantum physics" like so much of Hollywood.

The preferred term is "quantum mechanics"
The infinite universes theory is pretty well known, but there is more to it than being buff in one universe and a nerd in another. 

There can be one universe where one guy in Australia was born left handed instead of right handed, and then the different chain of events that could occur because of that change. Small changes have a snowball effect. 

People usually think of the big changes like a Hitler assassination, but the differences can be as mundane as you farting 10 seconds earlier on a given day. 
It was already posted in english by u/Satsumomo, u/gmfk07 translated it in english, I put the pieces together and u/oopsidaysy suggested a repost for karma reasons, so here it is
Are you saying their is a universe with a Big Bang that keeps banging? 
Fun fact about the "infinite universe" theory thing i learned while playing a philosophy game that kind of stuck with me.

An endless amount of universes does not imply that all universes exist. In example there is no guarantee there is a universe where you are the POTUS, because endless opportunitys does not mean endless outcomes.

Think of it like this, how many numbers is it between 1 and 2? If you apply decimals, the answer is infinite (1.1, 1.11, 1.111...). But even though you have infinite numbers, none of them are 3. So we have a infinite amount of numbers and none of them are 3 or 3.1 or 3.2.

Infinite fucks with logic. Think the original question was "what was the meaning with life" and the game argued that even if there exist infinite "meanings with life", none of them have to be correct, so the meaning of life does could not exist.
I wanna see more factual/theoretical science infobits presented by Rick!
Oh shit, an animated Ted Talk of Rick explaining different multiverse theories would be so squanch
Nice! 
I imagine only *one* big bang would be necessary. Immediately following its inception the universe would diverge into its first set of parallels. These universes would ultimately become vastly different from each other, because their variations occurred during a very early stage of development. The universes that Rick moves between must have diverged from each other much later then the big bang. Probably well after earth was formed, and perhaps after rick was born.
The first sentence is kinda weirdly phrased. Infinite expansion is not needed as an assumption for inflation to happen in infinitely different ways. 

I'll give you 500 schmeckles
Weird way to write inflation. It's like they messed it up and wrote infltion, realized their mistake and crammed an a in there.
I'm currently working on a fanfiction on the show which involves a much younger Rick (and who is black american) and takes place before the show started and in the third episode (the chapters are pretty long like a tv show) he learns through other Ricks the exact thing: The big bang did not created one universe, but rather multiple ones.

Because Mr Poopy Butthole is a parasite.  I know we're meant to believe that the whole 'shooting him' thing means he isn't one, but he totally is.  Perhaps when they've lived a long while they get tough enough to survive a gunshot.  I wouldn't try too hard to make R&M be internally consistent.  But he's a parasite.
thank god for that red circle, wouldn't have known where to look without it. 
As a friend of Rick, is it so hard to imagine that Gear Head wouldn't have also been hooked up with interdimensional cable too?
What do you mean with "in his own dimension"?
It could be possible that interdimensional TV is more commonplace in the Federation-level civilizations.
Morty just wants some FUCKING enchiladas. 
Guess this is another piece of evidence that this episode follows a Rick and Morty from another dimension? 
Its best not to think about it 
A little later in the episode, Rick is watching "Ball Fondlers" when it's interrupted by the news report about him and Morty being fugitives. I'm guessing Rovolio Clockberg Jr. has interdimensional cable.
He's watching an episode of Rick and Morty, of course.
They used the Area 51 one in the show if I recall
Do they use it to show them what they got though?

This is pretty much my mantra now, since I got into the show. For both good and bad reasons.
This isn't exactly the most cheery concept. It could certainly help one put things in perspective, but that's not the same as "cheering up."

What... thing?
One of my least favorite things actually. I don't like it.
There is a Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, American Dad Crossover So Those Are Connected too and theres a futurama and adventure time cameo
do you think we will see a crossover??
A Pence presidency would be _much_ worse, so I sincerely hope Rick doesn't get out of jail soon enough to do this
Poor taste. I seriously doubt Rick would care enough of about petty politics to commit an out right assassination. Would he respect Trump? HELL NO. But I don't see this as a Rick thing to do.

 Also, straight up violence isn't going to save 2016 or do anything productive. 

That and because a Pence presidency would be MUCH worse.

I still like your cartoons RageNineteen but this was honestly not my cup of tea. But I do like the production value but besides that... eeehhh no...
Get your shit politics out of here. 
I really doubt rick would care for something so little. Hes literally destroyed whole earths in several universes, and we even saw one such event with the crononberging. But alas content is content, although the forced political agenda is kinda meh...

That's amazing!

There's something to be said about how both the series and this art are able to show the more joyous, wondrous side of being insignificant in such a massive universe (or multiverse). Sure, our existence is an exercise in futility, but the stars will always beckon, and who knows what lies beyond them...
You HAVE to scan this in at a high resolution for backgrounds.
Any time I see a picture I imagine Rick saying "See this vast beautiful universe? It's all just meaningless bullshit."

Nicely done.
This is so good!! I love how you used warmer colors towards the bottom; the colors in general are just gorgeous. The blending between the orange-ish colors and the pink is heavenly. Excellent job! :~)
Show it without the tape!

Two things:
- He shows up right after C137 Rick and Morty arrive at the Morty dome
- Acts like he knows C137 Jerry; could just be that Jerry's don't change much..
You sorta countered your own argument in your argument. Doofus Rick never had any kids of his own, so he didn't have a Morty, let alone enough Mortys to hide from other Ricks. And someone as stupid as him would likely have tabs kept on him, so he doesn't accidentally get a hold of some sort of weapon and destroy entire worlds.
But didn't the evil morty create evil rick? 
Fuck yeah!! One-punch rules!!

Shouldn't it be males that shouldn't go to gazorpazorp? I mean, Rick was the one who screwed everything up, had it just been summer everything would have been fine.

I'm a huge fan of Rick and Morty so I thought I'd try my best at an acoustic version. I hope you enjoy.

This is really great
Very nicely done.
That's great, I love the mandolin.
I like that first thirsty ass comment above. Guys who try to hit up in porn comments might be my favorite type of Internet comment haha. Why do they do it? We may never know

The Venn diagram between Pornhub commenters and Reddit posters is a circle. 
I now sort of wish I posted this picture from my main account.... keep my identity hidden or Karma.... these are the questions that keep me up at night.
Cromulon bukkake, wiping out whole solar systems.
What's hmu? It sounds like something I don't wanna try.
This video led me to PornHub, which led me to recommended videos, which led me to type things into the search bar... which led me to cumming. 


So I pretty much just came because of Cromulon. Nice. 
I love porn comments, some are genuinely hilarious.

There was this one video, where the guy is "sleepwalking", goes into this girl's room, and starts banging her. The girl is all "Oh no, he's sleepwalking, I can't wake him up!".

Then the first comment: "He's not sleeping you stupid bitch, he's just Chinese.", I laughed so hard at that.
Yet they can't spell schwifty
What popular videos are you people watching where you find these comments? I feel so weird because I probably watch some obscure fetish kink.
I love the seemingly growing trend of hilarious pornhub comments.
The sad thing is that I know what video that is from
head bent over, raise it up her posterior.
Who the fuck comments on pornos
I expected to see "Just shake that ass bitch and let me see what you got." in the comments.

I bet they were all squanchin' if you get what I'm saying. 
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT
Am I the only one who REALLY wants to know what porn all the R&M fans were watching?
I'm just really surprised there isn't a full website that's a Rick and Morty inspired PornHub type of thing. I mean, for crying out loud; there was a character called "Mr. Poopy-Butthole"! 

Sorry! I mean there **is** a character called Mr. Poopy-Butthole and we wish him a speedy recovery.

If Rick had felt like being nice he could have told him "You're lucky you have a purpose. Imagine not having one."
I think that's part of the joke. They have a 100% success rate. Beth and Jerry have such a horrible marriage that the place has to burn down to prove it to them. 
My first instinct is to say no, people really died in horrifically terrible ways.  Thats just Rick and Morty being dark and nihilist as usual.
I was honestly surprised this wasn't how the episode ended.  As soon as they put on those helmets, I thought it was a simulation kind of like the futurama episode where bender gets an upgrade.
Possible, but usually if something like this happens they show it to the audience, don't think it happened here but who truly knows?
Well technically, the other people in the clinic died before they reconciled so their success rate is less than 100%
That's how I thought the episode was meant to be interpreted 
i think that's the irony of the episode, the messed up so bad they accomplished their task.
Read the user's name... It's not schwifty
I wanted the US elections to be over quick so that we could leave all of the political posts behind us and go back to normal. My wish completely backfired, there's more political posts than ever. 
How did he get there?
Is... Is he like worf from Star Trek? You know the guy with all that shit on his face? 
All the political posts are getting on my nerves, but I'll admit this one was pretty good.
Is this something we should be concerned about? 
*wink*
downvote all political spam in this sub! 
He is NOT my President
Lots of approximations, but:

He went from, what, 5.5' to roughly 15,840,000'.  

Standards stick of dynamite is 1.25" diameter, 8" length.  8"=0.67', 1.25"=0.1'

15,840,000/5.5=2,880,000 (linear growth factor)

2,880,000*0.67=1,929,600' (length of stick of dynamite)

2,880,000*0.1= 288,000' (diameter)

The volume of a cylinder is pi r^2 h

Pi * 144,000^2 * 1,929,600 = 1.25701988335E17 cubic feet.

Density of dynamite is 1 kiloton per 21,484.952 cubic feet.  

So 5,850,699,053,691 kilotons.

About 5.8 billion megatons?

Anyone wanna check any of that?

What would it do to earth?  Nooo idea.

Gerry giving birth. Maybe see him being a better mother than a father 
The robot Morty one 
The one near the end with 4 different ricks in a spaceship.
The bit where it looks like all the other Rick's will return
The one where Rick and Morty are in robot suits. Or maybe the one where they're in a pillow fight. I'd like to see how they got into that wacky situation
All of them. They'd all be brilliant
Cthulhu. I want to see Rick and Morty go full Lovecraft.
*makes it worse by giving Pence the reigns.*
OP deliver, lulz!!!
Why does the video just flash a cock at you?

Was this in the movie?
This took 3 hours to convert and upload...~~kill me~~
I could hear this
My favorite part is the laughter at the end. Sounds like someone was high in the studio recording the audio on the fly.
I just lose it when the moon comes crashing into Earth and I see their faces.
That was great
Only thing is you spelled twelfth gear twelth...awesome tho
When is Ball Fondlers coming to Adult Swim?
Twelfth

Thanks. I didn't know who she was and now i'm stuck in a pornhub vortex...
Man I'm in class and was like "Who's Reily Reid" and now I go some *homework* to attend to.
They're not gods, Riley 
Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody's going to die, just focus on being happy.
maybe a time machine that could take us to the 60's, beyond that, were pretty much on a shit slide.....
:/ sorry Riley, only 4 more years. You're super hot if it helps
To a lesser extent, season one in the "Rixty Minutes" episode when they start watching Gazorpazorpfield and Rick asks Morty if that's like the people from Gazorpazorp, and then Morty's awkward response. Too many to name of the top of my head, but definitely a main reason why I find so much joy watching each episode. 
In the episode before the parasite one you can see Rick stuff some rocks in the trunk of his ship. On those rocks are what looks like the eggs of the parasites, I quite liked that bit.
Bojack Horseman is a great show , I saw it before I saw R&M and I think they're equally great.
I've always considered Rick and Morty to be grown up Adventure Time. Of course it's a kid's show so it doesn't get as deep or crazy but it's a consistent and weird world that you explore through a kid and his older, saltier companion. I feel like a lot of other kid's shows do weird shit for the sake of being weird (which is fine, they're for kids) but if Adventure time does something really out there it effects future episodes making the world feel alive.
Archer is probably closest.  You might also look into Venture Brothers.
For something a little more G rated but just as involved and interesting, I'd suggest Gravity Falls.
Super Jail is fucking crazy like rick and Morty. Give it a go.
The latest season of "Regular Show" has reminded me of Rick and Morty on more than a few occasions. 

Keep in mind though, that Regular Show is more "PG-13" humor. And to fully enjoy this season (which is entirely set in space), it helps to have watched the previous 7 seasons. 

It's not a perfect suggestion, but I figured I'd put it out there. 
One show I can think of that is more of a distant ancestor, Red Dwarf. It is about a space hobo trying to not go insane from the loneliness of being the last living human 3 million years in the future.
If you enjoy the writing you might also enjoy Community which was created by Dan Harmon, its a fantastic show, but you should only watch the first three seasons, the only place to watch it legally would be hulu, or to actually buy it. 
Ugly Americans
Venture Brothers, Regular Show
There's one animatic of dogworld from which R&M came from:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npu3VnYs3IA
This is a stretch, but R&M reminds me a little of Invader Zim, especially the music. I feel like they could do a cameo, Jhonen Vasquez would probably be up for it. 
Futurama has some similar humour
I've been searching for shows similar to R+M for quite a while and I think it's genuinely unique. I don't see BoJack Horseman as too similar, it's rather dry and uneventful compared to Rick and Morty's sci-fi adventures. But Wilfred was fantastic, I liked Gravity Falls (much more PG and kid friendly), and Archer.  
Rick and Morty takes a lot of inspiration from Venture Brothers among other things.
Uncle grandpa. I was gonna say adventure time and regular show, but they were mentioned already. Bojack Horseman is great but doesn't come near R&M in my opinion. 
No jumping in the sewer.

I like Archer as well.  Only 'adult' cartoon shows I enjoy. 
Gravity Falls 
Try 'Man Seeking Woman'. Irreverence and some sci-fi wackiness.
Archer and Young Justice, two of my favorite shows. Archer is more for adult humor and Young Justice has some mature themes with more pg-13 humour 
Harmonquest.
I would suggest Doctor Who.
I always felt like Rick and Morty is a mixture of Doctor Who and Back to the Future + a little existential angst + completely unexpected awesome shit happens.
I don't think I've ever seen anything like Rick and Morty. I only discovered it a week ago and I'm already halfway through my 3rd viewing of season 1 and 2.
What did you eat before bed?
I'm sure there's a reality exactly like that.
Are these the feared pirates of the pancreas?! 
Aww geez Rick do we really have to sink ships and steal treasure.
Are they Pirates? stylizebot
Wow....all I dreamt about was lesbian sex. I feel cheated. Is that a robot hip/leg combo on Rick?
And that person found it on this sub reddit yesterday
I didn't realize the US was the only country with sun. TIL

Well, seeing that its purpose  is to create portals to other dimensions, as you type in the dimension ID (C-137) it comes up on the LED screen C-137.
We don't have any proof of this since we never seen it in the show but its the most logical use of it.  
Update: S01E07 has a bunch of great reference frames, but the most interesting is when Rick is typing something into the Portal Gun, onto the red panel. So, it seems to be a touch screen of sorts. I've found a red LCD 16x2 panel that has capacitive buttons. Might be a good compromise.

Edit: On which note, does Rick ever turn the dial/button at the top of the handle? Or does he only ever press it (I.E. It's not a dial)?
Hit the sack, Jack!

I dislike both candidates and totally expected Hilary to win and today would have went on like any other day. 

But she didn't, and instead of any normal day, I got to watch people lose their shit all over the internet and it has been very entertaining. 
This and the new Steven Colbert video made my day today! Thank you sir!
This was, hands down, my favorite moment in the entire series.

Well this one is already a repost...
Thank you. This is the first time I've laughed all day. 
Welp, I hope everyone is happy if they refused to vote or voted third party this time.
At least the days are only 42 hours long.
Thank you reddit for not only providing plenty of salt.  But plenty of the saltiest memes I've ever seen.  
Why the shit are there political posts in the Rick and Morty sub?

Ok this is my absolute favorite post on reddit now.
Here from the front page. Should I finally get around to watching this show? And, if so, where can I stream it?
I just joined this sub because I love rick and morty. Do the mods just let everybody post political garbage on here all the time?

tbh I'm a trump supporter AND like Rick and Morty
I'm unsubbing, fucking shitposts + political crap ruined this sub 
The sun ruse just as it always will! and it shined bright on americas future for once in 8 years get him out of the white house! 
Gross, we don't need to know about that. 
Really tired of seeing headlines about the premier date only to find they don't know shit about when.
That's the Christian Times.  They lie about everything.  Go ahead, google Half Life 3, Rick and Morty season 3, Left for Dead 3, or even Kotor 3--odds are they have an article about it published in the last 48 hours that says nothing.  
Thats sick
Thanks 
Where was that? Gotta pay them a visit tonight
Yes, it's hilarious. Very short but really fun.
